00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.019
[children shouting]

5
00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:21.105
[whistle blows]

6
00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:39.331
[man] Football is the most popular
cultural phenomena in the world.

7
00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:43.043
Nothing comes close.

8
00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:50.050
Nothing attracts audiences on the scale.

9
00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:54.555
nothing ignites the emotions
that football does.

10
00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:59.018
[cheering]

11
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:02.730
[dramatic organ music]

12
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.156
No country owns football.

13
00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:19.914
This is a common. collective.
human piece of cultural capital.

14
00:01:23.584 --> 00:01:27.713
This is the place that we celebrate
our collective humanity

15
00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:33.427
more intensely
and on a larger scale than anything.

16
00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:39.433
The World Cup is simply the most unifying
universal thing that humanity does.

17
00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:46.023
And it really matters
that the people who run it

18
00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:50.694
actually represent a collective humanity.

19
00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:57.868
And if it is full of self-serving
and corrupt individuals.

20
00:01:57.952 --> 00:02:03.249
and self-serving and malign states.
there is a problem.

21
00:02:03.332 --> 00:02:08.003
2018 FIFA World Cup
will be organised in Russia.

22
00:02:08.087 --> 00:02:09.088
[cheering]

23
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:10.673
[groaning]

24
00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:16.887
The winner to organise
the 2022 FIFA World Cup

25
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:19.139
is Qatar.

26
00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:26.355
FIFA has been rocked by more allegations
of corruption and fraud.

27
00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:29.775
The organisation that oversees
professional soccer around the world

28
00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.278
may be facing
the biggest scandal in its history.

29
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:35.531
[newsreader] Nine top officials
accused of taking $150 million

30
00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:36.949
in bribes and kickbacks.

31
00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:40.870
Several top officials of soccer's
world governing body were arrested.

32
00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:43.122
They corrupted the business
of worldwide soccer

33
00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:46.417
to serve their interests
and to enrich themselves.

34
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.044
[newsreader] Five of FIFA's
seven vice presidents

35
00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:52.464
have asked Blatter to step down.
but he has refused to do so.

36
00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:54.925
For what? Next question.

37
00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.679
[man] Sports have always been a way

38
00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:03.767
in which the dominant ideologies
of the day did battle with each other.

39
00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:11.483
Right now. the dominant ideologies
are democracy and autocracy.

40
00:03:12.568 --> 00:03:18.032
And somewhere in that giant divide
between the grassroots of something

41
00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:21.619
and how it is packaged
and sold around the world

42
00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.662
lies all the answers we're looking for.

43
00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:33.505
Does this work? It works.
We haven't sound-tested. Good morning.

44
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:37.927
Well. how do you get inside
monolithic organisations

45
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.095
that don't want you to know
what they're doing.

46
00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.973
are frightened what you would find out.

47
00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:45.059
how do you get in?

48
00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:50.230
Well. here's how I acquired
a huge collection

49
00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:54.610
of FIFA's most carefully guarded
confidential documents.

50
00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:23.222
[clears throat]
Let's find the microphones. Yeah? OK?

51
00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:28.769
It's taken 15 years to get
from my first cautious investigation

52
00:04:28.852 --> 00:04:33.232
through to where we are now. with
prison doors slamming all over the world.

53
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.409
In 2002. I went to one of President
Blatter's press conferences in Zurich.

54
00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:46.662
I thought.
"It's time to stir things up a bit."

55
00:04:48.872 --> 00:04:51.458
I grabbed the roving hand mic and said.

56
00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:54.420
"Herr Blatter.
have you ever taken a bribe?"

57
00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:59.008
Oh! Absolute pandemonium.
Nobody ever asked that question.

58
00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:05.389
[in German] No. Not like that.
Not me. Certainly not me.

59
00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.725
[Jennings]
Next day in the London newspapers

60
00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:10.978
was the headline.
"Blatter Denies Taking Bribes".

61
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:14.314
I'd got bribes onto the media agenda.

62
00:05:14.398 --> 00:05:17.484
I'm coming for you. Herr Blatter.
I know you're a crook.

63
00:05:17.568 --> 00:05:19.319
Because his reputation is appalling.

64
00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:21.488
But he has not to validate me.

65
00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:24.491
He has not to validate me.

66
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.203
[man]
Andrew had established quite a reputation

67
00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:31.290
as a passionate. obsessed

68
00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:34.752
and relentless hard-hitting
investigative reporter.

69
00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:37.046
[Jennings] The robbers on that team
aren't nice people.

70
00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.383
They're people who are quite prepared to
put both barrels of a sawn-off through you

71
00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:44.011
if you stand between them and the prize.

72
00:05:44.094 --> 00:05:48.682
He started investigating organised crime.
which is where he'd sort of made his name.

73
00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:52.978
On its way to Britain was then the biggest
ever load of cocaine. 400 kilos.

74
00:05:53.062 --> 00:05:55.147
a fantastic amount of cocaine.

75
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.733
And it was only later
that he got interested

76
00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:01.487
and moved his attention
to the world of international sport.

77
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.406
Are you the right person
to lead the Olympic movement?

78
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.408
[Oliver] And then he had moved on to FIFA.

79
00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:10.829
He was constantly telling stories.
constantly talking about FIFA.

80
00:06:10.913 --> 00:06:12.456
If you didn't want to know about FIFA.

81
00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.209
you shouldn't be sitting
anywhere near Andrew Jennings.

82
00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:20.214
I then started looking
at the definitions of organised crime

83
00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:24.301
as written by police officers.
by criminologists.

84
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:26.887
and I realised that…

85
00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:31.975
Sepp Blatter's tight ruling group
tick all the boxes.

86
00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:36.480
The loyalty comes up
from the 209 national associations.

87
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:40.943
and the rewards come down
in millions and millions of dollars.

88
00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:46.073
And then I thought. "Yeah. but where
did it start? Where does it come from?"

89
00:06:46.156 --> 00:06:51.161
Let's wind back.
It's 1974. The gangsters arrive.

90
00:06:57.376 --> 00:06:59.086
When you hear about
the family of football.

91
00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.255
it's actually the Havelange family.

92
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:07.136
João Havelange. for all his faults.
was an extraordinary innovator.

93
00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:09.304
a man who saw the future.

94
00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:14.017
He enters the world of football
in the mid-1950s

95
00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:17.813
when he becomes president
of the Brazilian Football Federation.

96
00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:24.278
and it is under Havelange that Brazil
wins its first World Cup in 1958.

97
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:27.072
At some point in the early 1970s.

98
00:07:27.156 --> 00:07:31.326
João Havelange decides to run
to be the president of FIFA.

99
00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:37.457
[announcer] The new president of FIFA
is Mr de Havelange.

100
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:39.793
[applause]

101
00:07:40.586 --> 00:07:45.841
And this happens just at the moment
when television broadcasting rights

102
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:51.513
start to bring vast fortunes
into FIFA's coffer.

103
00:07:52.973 --> 00:07:57.269
[in French] You can't ignore what
television represents in the modern world

104
00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:59.688
in the world of communications.

105
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:03.734
Before it was only seen
by those who were in the stadium

106
00:08:03.817 --> 00:08:07.029
or those who had a small radio.
but now everything has changed.

107
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:14.703
[man] TV sets came to every little village
in the Colombian mountains.

108
00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:17.289
the desert of Sahara.

109
00:08:17.372 --> 00:08:20.500
The big consumer good industry realised
there was a big potential

110
00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:25.881
in reaching audiences globally
through their banners around the stadium.

111
00:08:25.964 --> 00:08:30.010
through their logos
on the shirts and shoes.

112
00:08:31.053 --> 00:08:36.308
FIFA was in a very favourable position
because they had monopoly rights

113
00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:39.228
over their very attractive
live TV product.

114
00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.359
[Jennings] You may have heard of FIFA.

115
00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:48.362
but you probably
haven't heard of the company

116
00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.614
whose activities threaten to bring down

117
00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:53.325
some of the most powerful men
in world football.

118
00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:58.080
It's called
International Sports and Leisure. or ISL.

119
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.335
[Szymanski] FIFA made the decision

120
00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:07.965
to manage the marketing
of the rights in-house.

121
00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:12.678
They decided to create their own
internal organisation called ISL.

122
00:09:16.807 --> 00:09:19.685
[Goldblatt]
ISL. International Sport and Leisure.

123
00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:24.690
was a creation of João Havelange
and his ally Horst Dassler.

124
00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:29.695
Horst Dassler made Adidas
the most successful sportswear company

125
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:33.949
because he understood the power
of advertising and marketing.

126
00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:38.787
And he also pioneered the micropolitics
of sport and sponsorship.

127
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:45.002
He created. in effect.
a sports intelligence unit inside Adidas.

128
00:09:45.085 --> 00:09:48.880
masses of information
on every important figure

129
00:09:48.964 --> 00:09:51.842
in the world of global and national
sports bureaucracies.

130
00:09:51.925 --> 00:09:53.635
And that. of course. became the instrument

131
00:09:53.719 --> 00:09:56.888
for cutting the kind of deals
that you needed to do

132
00:09:56.972 --> 00:10:00.559
to get the Adidas stripes
on the team's boots.

133
00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:08.066
[Havelange. in French] When I took over.
I went to see Mr Horst Dassler.

134
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.237
We concluded
a very important contract for FIFA

135
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:14.948
which was the basic element

136
00:10:15.032 --> 00:10:19.786
for the development of soccer
in the world.

137
00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.708
When you go
to FIFA headquarters in Zurich.

138
00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:27.627
it's really the house that Adidas built.

139
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:31.757
and the linking between FIFA and Adidas
is massive.

140
00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:37.637
The model that they chose
was that ISL buys the media rights

141
00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.307
for the World Cup from FIFA for a set fee.

142
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.476
FIFA's backed that guarantee.

143
00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:47.189
and then ISL goes off and sells the rights
in many packages around the world

144
00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.566
and they can make a profit.

145
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:53.904
[Oliver] Now. in order to ensure
that ISL stayed the intermediary.

146
00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:58.658
secret payments. kickbacks.
were given to senior officials at FIFA.

147
00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:05.248
[interviewer] Was it Horst Dassler's
ambition to control the president of FIFA?

148
00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:09.461
Whether it's his ambition.
I think it is certainly his desire.

149
00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.880
and has always been his desire
since I've known him.

150
00:11:11.963 --> 00:11:13.757
to have a very strong influence

151
00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.052
on the president
and all the senior people of FIFA.

152
00:11:17.135 --> 00:11:21.181
[interviewer] A desire to influence. isn't
that diplomatic language in your world

153
00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.433
for control and manipulate?

154
00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:24.893
Probably.

155
00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:29.564
[African music and singing]

156
00:11:29.648 --> 00:11:31.441
[player shouts]

157
00:11:31.525 --> 00:11:34.069
[man. in German]
Arrival of FIFA instructors

158
00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:36.196
at the municipal youth centre.

159
00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:41.076
including the Swiss Werner Hersi.
Anton Bucheli and Sepp Blatter.

160
00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:43.870
[in Walser German] The development
of the foot must have a repetitive.

161
00:11:43.954 --> 00:11:49.918
even a permanent character.
to achieve efficient results.

162
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:56.258
[Goldblatt] Sepp Blatter is brought
into FIFA first as a technical advisor.

163
00:11:56.341 --> 00:11:59.636
Havelange recognises something in Blatter.

164
00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:06.560
And Havelange sends him out to Adidas
to work with Horst Dassler for a few years

165
00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:11.231
and to learn the dark arts of politics
in the world of international sport.

166
00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:17.028
And then he's ready. in the early 1980s.
to take over as general secretary.

167
00:12:17.112 --> 00:12:21.533
And at that point. Blatter is both
trusty. unquestioning servant

168
00:12:21.616 --> 00:12:23.952
and also the magician's apprentice.

169
00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:30.417
Sepp Blatter
is an extraordinary character.

170
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.671
On the one hand. you know.
he's the hard-bitten. no-nonsense.

171
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.132
realpolitik of FIFA.

172
00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:41.052
who knows where all the bodies are buried
and knows how power works.

173
00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:43.930
But there's another side to Blatter.

174
00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:48.852
In his youth. he was the wedding singer.
He liked to croon.

175
00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:51.730
Now. he earned.
paid his way through university

176
00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:56.234
with a mixture of singing
and waiting tables.

177
00:12:56.318 --> 00:13:00.071
And he modelled himself. by his own
admission. on Eddie Constantine…

178
00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:04.284
♪ I used to be like
all those other guys… ♪

179

an American B-movie actor

180
00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:10.582
playing a kind of 99-cent-shop James Bond.

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.668

- Yeah. but make it a big one.

183
00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:18.256

That's kind of Blatter's model.

185
00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:30.101
Mr Blatter. so nice to meet you
after feeling you for so many years.

186
00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:32.062
- Nice to have you here.
- Thank you very much.

187
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.189
Funny. I met you just in the men's room
a minute ago.

188
00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:37.400
- [laughter]
- You're full. I guess. Good.

189
00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.653
Blatter loved the stage
more than everything else.

190
00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:41.363
It was for him very important.

191
00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:44.241
The worst for him
is if they don't speak about him.

192
00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:47.744
He had two visions:
to strengthen his personal power in FIFA

193
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:49.162
and to develop the game.

194
00:13:49.246 --> 00:13:51.248
[applause]

195
00:13:57.379 --> 00:14:00.173
[Goldblatt] Always the way with autocrats
is when you leave.

196
00:14:00.257 --> 00:14:03.301
how do you secure your legacy?

197
00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.679
How do you make sure the next folks in

198
00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:09.432
don't go looking too deeply
into what's been happening in the past?

199
00:14:09.516 --> 00:14:11.101
[in French] For the presidency of FIFA.

200
00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:15.772
I am going to recommend
Mr Joseph Sepp Blatter.

201
00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:17.732
to whom I give the floor.

202
00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:25.365
FIFA has a very pyramid-like structure.
At the top of it is the president.

203
00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:30.328
There is six regional vice presidents

204
00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:32.914
from the six regions around the world.

205
00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:38.378
Beyond that. there is what was called
an executive committee

206
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:41.381
who were drawn from each of those regions.

207
00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:44.509
But when it came to the election
for the president.

208
00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:47.846
it was all of the member associations
who got a vote.

209
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.101
Like in the United Nations.
it's one country. one vote.

210
00:14:53.184 --> 00:14:57.731
[Goldblatt] This is very useful to know
if you're in the business of buying votes.

211
00:14:57.814 --> 00:15:03.028
It's very difficult to buy votes from
people who are already really wealthy.

212
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:08.825
But many of those countries are extremely
small and poor and easily influenced.

213
00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.994
and that's where you start.

214
00:15:16.875 --> 00:15:20.045
[Togoni] Blatter. he had not
the personal power as much as Havelange.

215
00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:22.464
and he didn't have the respect of all.

216
00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:26.426
All of us. not one or two.
all of us must try very hard

217
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:29.679
to restore the respect for football
and for the FIFA family.

218
00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:31.890
[Togoni] Blatter hated to have
a counter-candidate.

219
00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:35.685
[in Swedish] What is the difference
between you and Blatter?

220
00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:37.854
[in Swedish] He stands for continuity.

221
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:41.941
which means dictatorial behaviour

222
00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:46.655
and disregard for democratic rules.

223
00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:53.119
[Goldblatt]
If you've already been doing well

224
00:15:53.203 --> 00:15:55.747
out of the system
of patronage and clientelism

225
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.625
that has been established under Havelange

226
00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:02.420
and you want that to carry on.
stick with the devil you know.

227
00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:03.922
Blatter's your man.

228
00:16:04.005 --> 00:16:08.885
And that's basically. the same coalition
that voted Havelange into power

229
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.595
is held together.

230
00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:15.892
It is Africa. it's Latin America.
and the new kids on the block. Concacaf.

231
00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.981
[Togoni]
Chuck was probably the smartest guy

232
00:16:22.065 --> 00:16:25.443
who was sitting
in the executive committee.

233
00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:29.072
[Oliver] Chuck Blazer was the man
running football in North America.

234
00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:32.367
together with his friend. Jack Warner.

235
00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.578
the man running football
in Trinidad and Tobago.

236
00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.957
[Togoni]
They played a very perfect paso doble.

237
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.417
Jack Warner was the front man.

238
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.337
and Chuck Blazer was the man
who introduced the deals.

239
00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:49.175
[man] Blazer. of course. would ensure.
whatever he was involved in.

240
00:16:49.259 --> 00:16:50.927
there was a commission for himself.

241
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.431
He earned himself the nickname
within Concacaf as Mr 10%.

242
00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:58.393
[Goldblatt]
Blazer and Jack Warner. they're shameless.

243
00:16:58.476 --> 00:17:03.022
They are taking money on the side
on every single media deal.

244
00:17:03.106 --> 00:17:07.485
Chuck Blazer has got a duplex
in Trump Tower.

245
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.697
But wait. He's not just got one duplex.

246
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.243
He's got two cats. The cats
can't live with them. They need a duplex.

247
00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.578
[cat meows]

248
00:17:16.661 --> 00:17:20.999
He also has a phenomenal taste
for all the very finest restaurants

249
00:17:21.082 --> 00:17:23.251
that New York City can supply.

250
00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:25.879
Both of them have got
a Concacaf credit card

251
00:17:25.962 --> 00:17:29.466
and they are spending it
on whatever they damn well want.

252
00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:33.720
[Togoni] And then Bin Hammam
is an entrepreneur in Qatar.

253
00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:37.599
He came to FIFA via Asia.
He was president of Asia.

254
00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:39.309
[Goldblatt] Bin Hammam's a billionaire.

255
00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:43.313
He's interested in power.
He's not interested in money.

256
00:17:43.396 --> 00:17:47.025
[Togoni] Bin Hammam supported Blatter
for his election in 1998.

257
00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:50.236
Blatter promised Bin Hammam
probably to become his successor.

258
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.280
He promised this to many people.

259
00:17:52.363 --> 00:17:57.035
[man] It was crucial to get 20 votes
to move from Johansson to Blatter.

260
00:17:57.118 --> 00:18:00.413
Would Hammam procure votes for Blatter?

261
00:18:00.497 --> 00:18:04.042
Part of the procurement
was $50.000 per vote.

262
00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:10.298
[interviewer. in German] What was in
the envelopes which the lady handed out?

263
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:18.056
[in German] That's rubbish.
It's all a load of nonsense.

264
00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:23.728
If it's all nonsense.
then why do you react so strongly to it?

265
00:18:23.812 --> 00:18:27.690
We see a change in FIFA during the '90s.

266
00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:30.819
Really. I think.
that's a function of two things:

267
00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:34.280
the growing sums of money
that are coming into the game.

268
00:18:34.364 --> 00:18:40.870
and. two. the growing realisation
that something's not quite right here.

269
00:18:40.954 --> 00:18:43.873
And it's only then
that people start to say.

270
00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:46.292
"Well. where is all this money going?"

271
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:48.753
[interviewer]
You absolutely reject allegations.

272
00:18:48.837 --> 00:18:53.842
whether they are connected
to the Blatter campaign arranging bribes.

273
00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:55.510
you absolutely reject?

274
00:18:55.593 --> 00:18:56.970
Absolutely. absolutely.

275
00:18:57.053 --> 00:19:01.891
Mr Blatter is not… "competable".

276
00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:04.060
I mean. nobody can compete with him.

277
00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:07.522
[announcer. in French]
Mr Joseph Blatter: 111.

278
00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:12.485
- [applause]
- Mr Lennart Johansson: 80.

279
00:19:14.612 --> 00:19:20.493
[Blatter. in French] Thank you for having
elected me as the president of FIFA.

280
00:19:21.244 --> 00:19:24.122
[Jennings]
That. my friends. is soccer democracy.

281
00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:30.086
Voters from 18 African nations
had been bribed to support Blatter.

282
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:34.048
Those votes were enough
to defeat Lennart Johansson from Sweden.

283
00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:38.636
The election of Sepp Blatter
as president of FIFA was fraudulent.

284
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.891
He is not the legitimate president
of world soccer.

285
00:19:42.974 --> 00:19:45.518
[Yallop] I don't know what deal was done.
but I would say to you

286
00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:47.145
just watch for the next couple of years

287
00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:50.023
for a meaningless FIFA tournament
to be staged in Qatar.

288
00:19:56.654 --> 00:20:01.326
[Blatter] They would have you believe that
I sit in my office with a sinister grin.

289
00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:05.622
gently stroking the chin
of an expensive white Persian cat

290
00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:10.084
as my terrible sidekick.

291
00:20:10.168 --> 00:20:15.131
But that is not what we are.
That's not FIFA. That's not me.

292
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:18.801
I have dedicated my life
for the good of football around the world

293
00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:23.222
in the belief that football
has the power to build a better future.

294
00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:29.062
One is very near vomit sometimes
when Blatter starts talking about.

295
00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:31.397
"My mission to the world is…"

296
00:20:31.481 --> 00:20:34.734
His mission to the world is one thing:
stay in power.

297
00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:38.529
He resembles
the lowest lowlife. pond life.

298
00:20:38.613 --> 00:20:41.866
of particularly American politics
as we get to see more of it.

299
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.451
that you get elected today.

300
00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:46.454
and tomorrow you start raising money
for the next election.

301
00:20:46.537 --> 00:20:48.748
You're out there
doing whatever has to be done

302
00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:51.125
because you don't care about ideology.

303
00:20:51.209 --> 00:20:56.673
Democrat. socialist. trade union. Nazi.
they just wanna stay in power.

304
00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:05.139
Blatter does not like being investigated.

305
00:21:05.223 --> 00:21:07.725
What are your expenses?
What are your bonuses?

306
00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:10.186
How much do you earn?

307
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:12.063
[interviewer]
Why don't we know your salary?

308
00:21:12.146 --> 00:21:15.024
But why you should…
I don't know your salary.

309
00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:18.653
But you're an elected official.
I'm an employee. You're elected.

310
00:21:18.736 --> 00:21:22.031
[Jennings] And it's a reporter's job
to say. "I'm asking you again:

311
00:21:22.115 --> 00:21:24.283
how much does FIFA pay you?"

312
00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:29.497
Andrew Jennings would stand up and say.
"Have you taken a bribe?

313
00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.250
Where is this money?
Where are these documents?"

314
00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:35.086
That was absolutely his genius.

315
00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:41.134
because he knows that corrupt men of power
always have people in their organisations

316
00:21:41.217 --> 00:21:44.929
who they have annoyed. upset. humiliated.

317
00:21:45.013 --> 00:21:48.266
and it is those people
to whom he was speaking.

318
00:21:48.349 --> 00:21:52.270
It's like putting up a great big sign.
"You wanna get back at the boss?

319
00:21:52.353 --> 00:21:54.480
You wanna clear out the stables?

320
00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:56.983
I'm the man to send the documents to."

321
00:21:57.066 --> 00:21:59.068
[Jennings]
You remember your mother told you.

322
00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:02.613
"If you do bad things.
you will get caught one day."

323
00:22:05.283 --> 00:22:08.119
In the spring of last year.
ISL declared bankruptcy

324
00:22:08.202 --> 00:22:10.538
solely through mismanagement
of other contracts.

325
00:22:11.205 --> 00:22:14.625
[Blatter]
So I would like to give you an update

326
00:22:14.709 --> 00:22:21.174
of the collapse
of our marketing partner. ISL.

327
00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:25.219
[Oliver] It went bankrupt
because Horst Dassler died.

328
00:22:26.804 --> 00:22:30.725
And under Horst Dassler.
it was a very well-managed operation.

329
00:22:30.808 --> 00:22:32.310
whether it was corrupt or not.

330
00:22:32.393 --> 00:22:35.271
Under the subsequent management.
they basically ran it into the ground.

331
00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:37.648
paying too much for rights
they shouldn't have been buying

332
00:22:37.732 --> 00:22:40.568
rather than concentrating on
the really good things they already had.

333
00:22:40.651 --> 00:22:46.282
This situation is certainly
one of the biggest challenges

334
00:22:46.365 --> 00:22:50.703
in the history of the 97 years of FIFA.

335
00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:55.083
[Goldblatt] So when ISL goes bankrupt.
an awful lot of documentation

336
00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:59.587
falls into the possession
of the Swiss court and judicial system.

337
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:03.091
The most important document
that the Swiss authorities get hold of.

338
00:23:03.174 --> 00:23:07.595
it's just the list of names and numbers.

339
00:23:07.678 --> 00:23:10.556
the names of people
who were getting a kickback.

340
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.642
the amount of money that they're getting.

341
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.895
[Jennings] Folks have been named.

342
00:23:15.978 --> 00:23:21.484
Don't get excited.
This is transparency Swiss and FIFA style.

343
00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:23.569
After secret negotiations.

344
00:23:23.653 --> 00:23:28.407
the Swiss federal court has agreed
that the names can be kept secret.

345
00:23:29.367 --> 00:23:33.663
So it was clear by then
that there had been bribes paid.

346
00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:35.248
That was a starting point.

347
00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:37.834
The second question became:
who had been bribed?

348
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:46.592
The television Andrew worked in.

349
00:23:46.676 --> 00:23:49.137
there was a strong tradition
of what we call the doorstep.

350
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.099
which is. effectively. if they won't
speak. if they won't answer questions.

351
00:23:53.182 --> 00:23:54.392
you go and knock on their door

352
00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:56.644
or find them in the street
and ask them a question.

353
00:23:56.727 --> 00:24:00.231
What we came up with was.
well. OK. let's make the film

354
00:24:00.314 --> 00:24:04.110
about Andrew trying to find out
who got the bribes.

355
00:24:04.777 --> 00:24:11.033
Andrew had a reputation for being somewhat
aggressive in his approach to people.

356
00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:12.743
So the first Panorama we made.

357
00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:16.664
what our editor wanted
was a slightly more questioning approach.

358
00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:21.544
And he said. "Have you ever seen
that TV detective in America. Columbo?"

359
00:24:21.627 --> 00:24:25.840
Oh. Mr Devlin. just one more thing. sir.

360
00:24:25.923 --> 00:24:28.676
- Yes. Lieutenant.
- I hate to bother you.

361
00:24:28.759 --> 00:24:30.303
[Oliver] You know. just one more question.

362
00:24:30.386 --> 00:24:32.972
"President Blatter.
can I just ask you one more question?"

363
00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:36.184
And Andrew really liked this idea.
"Oh. yeah. I can do that."

364
00:24:36.267 --> 00:24:38.227
And as it turned out. I had a mackintosh

365
00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:41.147
which was very like the one
worn by Columbo.

366
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.566
so I took that along. gave it to Andrew.

367
00:24:43.649 --> 00:24:48.487
and that's how he sort of adopted the
Columbo image that he had in the films.

368
00:24:48.571 --> 00:24:50.781
Please. can I come
into your press conference?

369
00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:56.287
I said. please.
may I come into your press conference?

370
00:24:56.954 --> 00:24:57.955
When? Now?

371
00:24:58.039 --> 00:24:59.040
- Yeah. now.
- OK.

372
00:24:59.123 --> 00:25:00.374
- May I come in?
- Yes. OK.

373
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:02.335
Some of your press people
won't always let me in.

374
00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:04.337
But I will take care of it. OK?

375
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.796
Let me just ask you.

376
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.885
Do you know which football officials took
bribes from the ISL marketing company?

377
00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:13.638
I'm sorry. I don't speak about that.

378
00:25:13.721 --> 00:25:16.682
[Oliver] Once he worked out
who he should be targeting.

379
00:25:16.766 --> 00:25:22.104
he would relentlessly pursue whatever
the subject was to the ends of the earth.

380
00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:24.148
Can you explain why they paid you in cash?

381
00:25:24.232 --> 00:25:25.983
Did you never take bribes from ISL?

382
00:25:26.067 --> 00:25:30.613
Mr Teixeira! Did you take your bribes
through the Sanud company?

383
00:25:30.696 --> 00:25:31.822
Mr Bedoya!

384
00:25:31.906 --> 00:25:34.200
[Spanish accent]

385
00:25:34.283 --> 00:25:38.287
[Jennings] You speak English. That's good
English. It's good English. OK. right.

386
00:25:38.371 --> 00:25:40.164
Geoff. can we talk to you?

387
00:25:40.248 --> 00:25:42.792
[whispers] You were saying
on the BBC interview this morning

388
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:46.921
there's no corruption problem at FIFA.
and I was a bit puzzled.

389
00:25:49.215 --> 00:25:52.260
[Oliver]
And we started driving around Switzerland.

390
00:25:52.343 --> 00:25:56.806
knocking on various doors
to see if anyone would talk to us.

391
00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:59.809
Usually met with a polite.
"No. thank you."

392
00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:01.185
And then it was on to the next door.

393
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:05.982
Occasionally you might go for a coffee
and they'd say politely.

394
00:26:06.065 --> 00:26:08.025
"Well. yes.
but we're not gonna tell you anything.

395
00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:10.528
and even if we did.
we're not going on the record."

396
00:26:11.779 --> 00:26:14.949
You've gotta remember
that when I started working with Andrew.

397
00:26:15.032 --> 00:26:16.951
he's already been banned by FIFA.

398
00:26:17.034 --> 00:26:19.328
Why am I banned from FIFA House?

399
00:26:19.412 --> 00:26:20.830
- What have I done?
- No comment.

400
00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:23.207
[Oliver] So he's persona non grata.

401
00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:28.087
[Jennings] I was banished. but I kept on
publishing embarrassing stories.

402
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.381
I disclosed this
in the London "Daily Mail".

403
00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:33.134
Within hours. FIFA's website announced.

404
00:26:33.217 --> 00:26:36.846
"President Blatter has instructed
their lawyers to file lawsuits

405
00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:39.348
against Andrew Jennings
and the "Daily Mail"."

406
00:26:39.432 --> 00:26:45.104
There are legal actions running against
this newspaper. against a journalist.

407
00:26:45.855 --> 00:26:48.607
which have put the game in disrepute.

408
00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:51.569
[Jennings] The number of legal threats
I've had from that lot.

409
00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:55.239
a few days to retract
or there's gonna be massive penalties.

410
00:26:55.323 --> 00:26:57.700
you know.
and you wallpaper the walls with them.

411
00:26:58.743 --> 00:27:01.203
What they don't do
is they don't use violence.

412
00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:04.707
because they're just
white-collar criminals… I hope.

413
00:27:09.337 --> 00:27:13.007
FIFA sent people without FIFA name tags.

414
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.760
spies like Peter Hargitay.

415
00:27:15.843 --> 00:27:18.846
to observe what Andrew said in the bar.

416
00:27:20.014 --> 00:27:22.641
Then people around him
that were not his friends.

417
00:27:28.898 --> 00:27:32.068
[Goldblatt]
You could see it got under their skins.

418
00:27:35.988 --> 00:27:40.826
Most sports journalists are dependent
on the people in power.

419
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.244
…like this in my whole life.

420
00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:45.790
covering matches
in the World Cup. Champions League…

421
00:27:45.873 --> 00:27:50.211
[Goldblatt] Is there any industry in which
so many people spend so much time

422
00:27:50.294 --> 00:27:52.171
saying absolutely nothing?

423
00:27:52.254 --> 00:27:55.508
An easy enough question for George Karl
is look where we are…

424
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:57.551
[Goldblatt]
I mean. it makes mainstream politics

425
00:27:57.635 --> 00:28:00.805
look lucid and transparent by comparison.

426
00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:02.390
…a blanket on top of him.

427
00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:06.644
[Goldblatt]
Andrew was so bold in that way.

428
00:28:06.727 --> 00:28:11.065
And he wasn't just gonna rock the boat.
He was gonna blow it up and sink it.

429
00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:17.738
In the beginning. it was only two.
three critical journalists. maybe five.

430
00:28:17.822 --> 00:28:19.907
Nobody was interested in this.

431
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:24.120
You would be crazy
to send me to report the game.

432
00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:25.830
- I might get the score wrong.
- [laughter]

433
00:28:25.913 --> 00:28:28.791
[man] At the time he was seen
as the eccentric guy. you know.

434
00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:33.879
bit of an oddball in some ways.
but a prolific journalist.

435
00:28:33.963 --> 00:28:37.925
someone who had a story.
would go after it.

436
00:28:38.008 --> 00:28:40.845
In those days.
you'd get interviewed every week or so.

437
00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:44.056
but it was always about football.
always about the game.

438
00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.725
not about the politics around football.

439
00:28:46.809 --> 00:28:48.769
[applause]

440
00:28:52.523 --> 00:28:55.276
[Jennings] Thank you very much.
Do we have sound?

441
00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:58.946
In the 1990s.
they started the Play the Game conference.

442
00:28:59.029 --> 00:29:01.073
…systematic use of drugs
in Italian track…

443
00:29:01.157 --> 00:29:04.910
[Andersen] I wanted to improve
sports journalism through this conference.

444
00:29:04.994 --> 00:29:09.999
And what triggered me was Andrew.
because he was a pioneer.

445
00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:14.420
As Dick Pound said the other night.
doping and corruption is so intertwined.

446
00:29:14.503 --> 00:29:17.423
[Liburd]
I attended Play the Game conference.

447
00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:19.842
When I look at the schedule.
it's just amazing.

448
00:29:19.925 --> 00:29:24.013
Everything. doping in cycling
to match fixing.

449
00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:26.849
The people who are there presenting

450
00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:29.685
are all at the top of their field.
the top of their game.

451
00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:32.813
Andrew had created a network.

452
00:29:32.897 --> 00:29:35.399
Major League Baseball
is back in the news tonight.

453
00:29:35.483 --> 00:29:38.319
[newsreader] The allegation from
the Association of Tennis Professionals…

454
00:29:38.402 --> 00:29:41.280
[newsreader 2] …wants authorities
to look into how he was not suspended.

455
00:29:41.363 --> 00:29:44.825
The immediate future of sumo wrestling
hangs in the balance tonight.

456
00:29:45.743 --> 00:29:49.288
I would say
that eight out of ten of the stories

457
00:29:49.371 --> 00:29:51.874
that have marked
the international sports agenda.

458
00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:54.919
those journalists have been around
Play the Game.

459
00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:57.213
There's a kind of nervousness
I see in Blatter these days.

460
00:29:57.296 --> 00:29:59.798
Is he there? Is he there?
Is he under there?

461
00:29:59.882 --> 00:30:02.468
Again. it was that excellent reporter.
Jean-François Tanda.

462
00:30:02.551 --> 00:30:04.595
who got hold of crucial evidence.

463
00:30:04.678 --> 00:30:07.681
[Andersen]
And Andrew used all the days to chat

464
00:30:07.765 --> 00:30:11.185
and showed the way
to many of the younger journalists.

465
00:30:11.268 --> 00:30:13.187
He gave them the recipe.

466
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.397
He said.
"Don't build on anonymous sources.

467
00:30:15.481 --> 00:30:19.109
Don't build on slandering.
Don't build on gossip.

468
00:30:19.193 --> 00:30:20.361
Get the documents."

469
00:30:21.111 --> 00:30:25.366
You've got to get your brilliant stories
out to the wider world.

470
00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:28.244
because that way
the pressure will come back.

471
00:30:28.327 --> 00:30:30.496
so that something has to be done.

472
00:30:32.164 --> 00:30:34.458
[Goldblatt] It was so fantastic

473
00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:40.548
to see the very small number of
sports journalists begin to probe around.

474
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:43.509
Lasana Liburd. probably
the most experienced football reporter

475
00:30:43.592 --> 00:30:46.011
we have in Trinidad and Tobago.

476
00:30:46.095 --> 00:30:48.681
[Goldblatt] So this journalist
from Trinidad and Tobago

477
00:30:48.764 --> 00:30:50.766
did a bit of investigation.

478
00:30:51.684 --> 00:30:55.312
And he discovered that 5.000 tickets
for the game against England

479
00:30:55.396 --> 00:30:58.190
suddenly are being sold online

480
00:30:58.274 --> 00:31:02.278
as part of a package with a travel agency.

481
00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:05.489
Straightaway. you know.
something kind of flashes in my head.

482
00:31:05.573 --> 00:31:07.533
Maybe I should check this out.

483
00:31:07.616 --> 00:31:13.872
So I do some research and found out that
Simpaul. it's really run by Jack Warner.

484
00:31:14.582 --> 00:31:17.376
And there was this company. Renraw.

485
00:31:17.459 --> 00:31:19.378
which is actually Warner
spelled backwards.

486
00:31:19.461 --> 00:31:23.173
His wife. Maureen.
and his sons. Daryan and Daryll.

487
00:31:23.257 --> 00:31:25.676
were all part of the company as well.

488
00:31:25.759 --> 00:31:28.137
[Goldblatt]
He then gets delusions of grandeur.

489
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.849
He runs for parliament.
he becomes an MP in Trinidad.

490
00:31:31.932 --> 00:31:35.102
and he actually. for a short time.
becomes a cabinet minister.

491
00:31:35.185 --> 00:31:39.273
while still doing
all of his FIFA and Concacaf jobs.

492
00:31:39.356 --> 00:31:44.278
He's taking money from FIFA that should be
going into building training facilities.

493
00:31:44.361 --> 00:31:48.782
When it comes to finding ways
of making a buck. he's impressive.

494
00:31:49.575 --> 00:31:51.660
[reporter] It was an earthquake
that devastated Haiti.

495
00:31:51.744 --> 00:31:53.996
killing thousands of people.

496
00:31:54.079 --> 00:32:00.502
and Jack Warner. one of football's most
powerful men. promised help. FIFA money.

497
00:32:00.586 --> 00:32:03.380
But investigators have claimed
it was transferred to accounts

498
00:32:03.464 --> 00:32:07.134
controlled by Warner for his personal use.

499
00:32:07.217 --> 00:32:11.805
Warner has been accused
of embezzling $750.000 of aid funds.

500
00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:14.266
[Jennings]
How does Warner get away with this?

501
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.018
Blatter may be the president.

502
00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:20.648
but Warner is at present
the most powerful man in world soccer.

503
00:32:20.731 --> 00:32:23.192
All right. no problem.
We talk again later. All right.

504
00:32:24.485 --> 00:32:26.862
[Oliver]
We wanted to interview Jack Warner.

505
00:32:26.945 --> 00:32:29.657
Obviously he didn't want
to be interviewed.

506
00:32:30.574 --> 00:32:33.911
[Jennings] One of his lawyers in Trinidad
emailed me and said if I asked questions.

507
00:32:33.994 --> 00:32:36.038
appropriate action would be taken.

508
00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:38.499
and I can't imagine
what they were talking about.

509
00:32:38.582 --> 00:32:39.958
I'm a journalist. like you.

510
00:32:40.042 --> 00:32:44.171
I ask questions politely. fairly.
firmly if necessary.

511
00:32:45.464 --> 00:32:50.094
[Oliver] And then we got tipped that
he was going to be landing with the team.

512
00:32:50.177 --> 00:32:55.224
So we thought. brilliant. we know where
he's gonna be. and we waited for him.

513
00:32:57.726 --> 00:33:01.939
And I remember Andrew
kind of leaning forward.

514
00:33:02.022 --> 00:33:04.692
and everybody leaning in
to hear what he had to say.

515
00:33:07.528 --> 00:33:12.574
And Andrew said. um.
"Let's get these corrupt fuckers."

516
00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:15.786
- Mr Warner. hello again.
- Leave me alone.

517
00:33:15.869 --> 00:33:17.871
- Can I ask you how much…
- Leave me alone.

518
00:33:17.955 --> 00:33:21.208
Please don't do that. Can I ask you
how much money you're making?

519
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:23.460
- Leave me alone.
- [man] Please do something for us now.

520
00:33:23.544 --> 00:33:24.837
[Jennings] Please don't do that.

521
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.880
I'm trying to ask you
how much profit you're making

522
00:33:26.964 --> 00:33:28.549
from World Cup tickets this year.

523
00:33:28.632 --> 00:33:32.553
Why is it your family always gets
the juiciest fee for contracts?

524
00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:35.806
Mister. leave me alone. please.
Leave me alone. please. Leave me alone.

525
00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:37.725
- Leave me alone.
- [Jennings] …this year.

526
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.020
Hello? Mr Warner? I know… Please.

527
00:33:42.104 --> 00:33:45.190
Why won't you talk about
these football issues?

528
00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:49.903
Good evening. Mr Warner.
Andrew Jennings. BBC Panorama programme.

529
00:33:49.987 --> 00:33:52.948
- Would you give me an interview?
- Excuse. excuse.

530
00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:54.867
- Would you…?
- Excuse us. please.

531
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:57.453
We're on the public highway.
Please don't interrupt.

532
00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:08.088
"Mr Jennings went as far as attempting
to physically obstruct me

533
00:34:08.172 --> 00:34:09.840
from taking the podium."

534
00:34:09.923 --> 00:34:13.469
[Oliver] We found out afterwards.
Jack Warner issued a press release.

535
00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:17.181
which was hilariously headlined
"Operation Get Jack Warner".

536
00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:19.725
[Jennings]
"His actions provoked a crowd of onlookers

537
00:34:19.808 --> 00:34:23.228
who sought to keep Mr Jennings
from my path.

538
00:34:23.312 --> 00:34:27.941
I caution him
to be less irresponsible in the future."

539
00:34:28.025 --> 00:34:32.237
[Oliver] I think he found being questioned
by Andrew deeply offensive.

540
00:34:32.321 --> 00:34:37.659
How dare this scruffy journalist ask me
questions about my business affairs?

541
00:34:37.743 --> 00:34:42.164
Here I am arriving with the Soca Warriors.
Andrew Jennings is there.

542
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:44.541
Here I am going to speak to my people.

543
00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:47.169
Andrew Jennings there
asking me annoying questions.

544
00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:49.713
Here I am arriving in Zurich.

545
00:34:49.797 --> 00:34:52.925
It's Andrew Jennings
asking annoying questions.

546
00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:55.219
Mr Warner. good morning.
Welcome to Zurich.

547
00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:58.514
How much profit did you make
selling World Cup tickets this year?

548
00:34:58.597 --> 00:35:01.058
It's only a very polite inquiry.
Mr Warner.

549
00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:05.521
If you could spit on me.
you would spit on me?

550
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.566
Why would you spit on me?

551
00:35:11.276 --> 00:35:14.363
[Oliver] It was surprising.
I think Andrew was actually delighted.

552
00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:17.282
For us. it is really good television.
because it demonstrates

553
00:35:17.366 --> 00:35:20.953
here's a guy not willing to respond
to even reasonable questions.

554
00:35:21.036 --> 00:35:22.162
and that says something.

555
00:35:22.246 --> 00:35:25.332
How much money did you make
selling World Cup tickets this year?

556
00:35:25.415 --> 00:35:26.625
Ask your mother.

557
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:27.709
- Ask…?
- Your mother.

558
00:35:27.793 --> 00:35:29.461
Ask my mother?
My mother's dead. actually.

559
00:35:29.545 --> 00:35:32.923
- But nice of you to remind me of that.
- Go to find her. Find her.

560
00:35:33.006 --> 00:35:36.260
Thank you so much. Mr Warner. Thank you.

561
00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:42.099
[Liburd] So often in our line of work.

562
00:35:42.182 --> 00:35:46.478
we do stories
hoping that we can create change.

563
00:35:47.938 --> 00:35:53.110
And. you know. a story's done.
but people kept it in a blind eye.

564
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:58.282
Jack Warner was involved
in the black market ticket trade again.

565
00:35:58.365 --> 00:36:01.201
Why hasn't this been investigated by FIFA?

566
00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:07.374
The Jack Warner case
is not a case that we have dealt with.

567
00:36:08.125 --> 00:36:11.211
Should it be knowledgeable to us

568
00:36:11.295 --> 00:36:17.175
by official means or by official channels.

569
00:36:17.259 --> 00:36:20.470
then naturally
then we would have a look on that.

570
00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:27.227
[Oliver] There were no consequences.
Jack Warner stayed on.

571
00:36:30.772 --> 00:36:33.775
I remember my editor at the time
sort of saying afterwards. you know.

572
00:36:33.859 --> 00:36:37.279
"Well… I don't know.
what's the point. you know?

573
00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:39.990
We show this corruption.
and nothing happens."

574
00:36:42.159 --> 00:36:45.495
Andrew viewed it slightly differently.
He said there was a bright side to this.

575
00:36:45.579 --> 00:36:47.915
He said. "Well. you know.
we'll be able to do another story

576
00:36:47.998 --> 00:36:50.542
because they're still there."

577
00:36:54.046 --> 00:36:57.049
[cheering]

578
00:37:05.807 --> 00:37:09.770
The decision
of the Confederation of African Football

579
00:37:09.853 --> 00:37:14.316
to hold the 20th Nations Cup tournament
in South Africa

580
00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:21.573
is the best gift Africa could present
our sporting community

581
00:37:21.657 --> 00:37:25.786
and in particular
to the soccer fraternity.

582
00:37:25.869 --> 00:37:28.997
For this we thank you
from the bottom of our hearts.

583
00:37:33.418 --> 00:37:36.755
[Jennings]
South Africa is being looted by FIFA.

584
00:37:36.838 --> 00:37:41.259
and I knew that three years ago
when Blatter went to the African Union.

585
00:37:41.343 --> 00:37:43.387
And when he said.
"We're doing this for Africa".

586
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.264
I knew Africa
was gonna get robbed blind.

587
00:37:46.348 --> 00:37:48.058
It brings tears to your eyes

588
00:37:48.141 --> 00:37:53.647
to see that it's bringing nothing
whatsoever to the ordinary folk.

589
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.774
[cheering]

590
00:37:59.486 --> 00:38:01.071
[Wright] I got sent to go write

591
00:38:01.154 --> 00:38:04.491
about the stadiums
they were building in South Africa.

592
00:38:04.574 --> 00:38:10.122
and it took about 30 seconds to figure out
that. like. this doesn't make sense.

593
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:16.837
You cannot separate the way people feel
about their sports teams

594
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.256
from the way that they feel
about their home.

595
00:38:19.339 --> 00:38:21.967
That's all politics is really.

596
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:26.221
is weaponising people's hopes and dreams
and fears about their home.

597
00:38:27.389 --> 00:38:31.059
[reporter] When South Africa won the bid
to host the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

598
00:38:31.143 --> 00:38:33.520
attention immediately turned
to whether the Rainbow Nation

599
00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:35.814
could provide FIFA-approved stadia.

600
00:38:35.897 --> 00:38:38.692
South Africa put ten world-class venues
across nine host cities.

601
00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:45.699
[Liburd] But FIFA doesn't actually
put money in constructing football stadia.

602
00:38:45.782 --> 00:38:49.578
Only governments. you know.
spend taxpayers' money in that way.

603
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:52.664
[man] Our government is concerned
about developing spaces.

604
00:38:52.748 --> 00:38:54.833
not population development.

605
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:59.337
By building these stadia.
they are moving people away

606
00:38:59.421 --> 00:39:02.799
from their original places.
even in rural areas.

607
00:39:02.883 --> 00:39:08.764
To us. this World Cup
is a mass eviction of poor people.

608
00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:12.684
[man 2] South Africa's spent more than
three billion euros building stadiums.

609
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:17.606
[woman] It cost nearly $150 million
to build the stadium.

610
00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:21.026
and only four FIFA games
will be played here.

611
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:25.489
Some locals are asking. could the money
have been better spent on something else?

612
00:39:26.364 --> 00:39:28.575
[man 3] You know. this has been
a gigantic pyramid scheme

613
00:39:28.658 --> 00:39:30.911
where we've hosted the tournament.
we've paid for it.

614
00:39:30.994 --> 00:39:32.662
but the profits go somewhere else.

615
00:39:32.746 --> 00:39:35.457
It just seems like
a new form of colonialism to me.

616
00:39:38.835 --> 00:39:43.465
[Wright Thompson] No country
that has voters ever wants a World Cup.

617
00:39:43.548 --> 00:39:46.551
The only people
who ever have to host a World Cup

618
00:39:46.635 --> 00:39:48.845
are people who have it
shoved down their throat

619
00:39:48.929 --> 00:39:52.182
by people in power
who have ulterior motives.

620
00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:59.481
Sasha. Sasha. wake up.

621
00:40:01.108 --> 00:40:04.694
[chanting] Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha!

622
00:40:14.788 --> 00:40:17.958
Hi. I'm Nicole Kidman.
and I'm gonna show you

623
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:23.421
why Australia is ready to host
the FIFA World Cup in 2018 or 2022.

624
00:40:24.214 --> 00:40:29.344
What makes us want to host the World Cup
is our belief in football.

625
00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:33.890
Bringing the World Cup to Qatar
will be bringing the World Cup

626
00:40:33.974 --> 00:40:35.600
to the Middle East for the first time.

627
00:40:35.684 --> 00:40:38.979
[man] It's obvious why we would like
to host the World Cup.

628
00:40:39.062 --> 00:40:41.439
So why should England be chosen?

629
00:40:41.523 --> 00:40:44.818
We have fantastic stadiums.
some of the best.

630
00:40:44.901 --> 00:40:48.029
[man 2] Would we love the World Cup
in the United States?

631
00:40:48.113 --> 00:40:52.159
In how many languages can you say.
"Oh. yeah"?

632
00:40:54.494 --> 00:40:57.080
Countries enter bidding contests
for a number of reasons.

633
00:40:57.164 --> 00:41:01.793
the key one of which is usually to
exercise influence through soft diplomacy.

634
00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:06.965
In 2009. it was understood
that the big rivals for 2022

635
00:41:07.048 --> 00:41:08.633
were Australia and the USA.

636
00:41:08.717 --> 00:41:12.012
Mr Obama is naturally advocating.

637
00:41:12.095 --> 00:41:18.310
please. President Blatter.
make another move towards United States.

638
00:41:18.393 --> 00:41:21.146
[Mersiades] And frankly
the US could host a World Cup tomorrow.

639
00:41:21.229 --> 00:41:24.316
That's just such a big country
with all the facilities you need.

640
00:41:25.525 --> 00:41:28.612
[Goldblatt] I think the English-speaking
nations that were bidding.

641
00:41:28.695 --> 00:41:30.822
there was extraordinary naivety.

642
00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:34.534
The Americans are handing out goody bags

643
00:41:34.618 --> 00:41:40.040
with a badge. a pencil
and a signed biography of Bill Clinton.

644
00:41:40.123 --> 00:41:44.669
I spoke to Lord Triesman. and I asked him.
you know. "How's the bid going?"

645
00:41:44.753 --> 00:41:48.882
And he said. "We're gonna play
absolutely straight. no bribery.

646
00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:50.508
absolutely on our merits."

647
00:41:50.592 --> 00:41:53.345
And I thought. "Bless you. I love you.

648
00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:58.141
You can never. ever. ever win
the World Cup."

649
00:41:58.225 --> 00:42:02.771
The 2018 World Cup. do you think
you have a good chance to host it?

650
00:42:02.854 --> 00:42:04.689
[speaks Russian]

651
00:42:04.773 --> 00:42:06.775
[interpreter]
I proceed from the assumption

652
00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:11.863
that the members of FIFA will adopt
the decision in favour of Russia's choice.

653
00:42:11.947 --> 00:42:15.408
[man] The Australian government
strongly supports Australia's bid

654
00:42:15.492 --> 00:42:17.035
to host the FIFA World Cup.

655
00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:21.665
I hope and pray
that we may be the lucky country.

656
00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:26.586
[Mersiades] And at the time.
I had a bit of a suspicion about Qatar.

657
00:42:28.421 --> 00:42:31.383
And in fact one of our consultants said.
you know. "Don't be stupid.

658
00:42:31.466 --> 00:42:35.637
Of course Qatar are not going to win it.
They can't possibly host it.

659
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.600
Qatar's hot. you know.
it's bloody hot in June.

660
00:42:40.684 --> 00:42:42.852
and not even Mohammed wants it."

661
00:42:42.936 --> 00:42:46.398
Referring to Mohammed bin Hammam.
who is on the FIFA executive committee.

662
00:42:47.357 --> 00:42:52.570
But what I found over the course
of digging a bit deeper into this was.

663
00:42:52.654 --> 00:42:56.366
it was absolutely clear.
nothing is based on merit.

664
00:42:57.158 --> 00:43:01.830
Australia paid $14.7 million
to three supposed consultants

665
00:43:01.913 --> 00:43:04.165
during the bidding for the World Cup.

666
00:43:04.249 --> 00:43:06.376
This is an established fact.

667
00:43:06.459 --> 00:43:10.130
The consultants they hired
were totally dirty.

668
00:43:11.006 --> 00:43:14.926
Peter Hargitay. he was locked up
for seven months in 1997

669
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:17.387
for cocaine trafficking and bond fraud.

670
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:22.017
Millions and millions of British pounds
went into those consultants.

671
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.687
and it was reasonable to suspect

672
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:28.189
that most of that money
was black bag money.

673
00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:34.362
Consultants and bidding committees
have become very. very good

674
00:43:34.446 --> 00:43:38.533
over the last 20 years
of working out who's available.

675
00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:41.745
what do they want
and how do you get to them?

676
00:43:41.828 --> 00:43:46.333
The FIFA executive committee
was the body that made the decision

677
00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:48.585
on who gets to host the World Cup.

678
00:43:48.668 --> 00:43:55.008
So to win 2018 or 2022.
you had to please 13 of the 24 men.

679
00:43:55.091 --> 00:43:57.635
[Goldblatt]
So it's people like Chuck Blazer.

680
00:43:57.719 --> 00:44:00.013
It's people like Jack Warner.

681
00:44:00.096 --> 00:44:03.641
These are the kinds of characters
who are making the decision.

682
00:44:03.725 --> 00:44:06.936
And we all know
that they have their price.

683
00:44:07.854 --> 00:44:10.774
[Mersiades] I had gone to my boss
and my boss's boss and said.

684
00:44:10.857 --> 00:44:12.859
"Look. I'm not comfortable
with what we're doing."

685
00:44:12.942 --> 00:44:16.488
There was no way
this was a merit-based assessment.

686
00:44:16.571 --> 00:44:19.908
And the result of that was
I was eventually sacked

687
00:44:19.991 --> 00:44:23.495
because it just became too annoying
for them to keep hearing it.

688
00:44:25.538 --> 00:44:30.960
But Andrew Jennings always used to say
to me. "Revenge is best served cold."

689
00:44:31.044 --> 00:44:34.798
And that was his understanding.
that in gathering evidence.

690
00:44:34.881 --> 00:44:37.926
putting together papers.
that can take time.

691
00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:40.887
He would always end every conversation
with. "Onwards and upwards."

692
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.973
And I found that really quite inspiring.

693
00:44:44.057 --> 00:44:47.143
[Jennings] Thank you for doing this.
I'm sorry we're not being more hospitable.

694
00:44:47.227 --> 00:44:48.978
[Oliver] Not at all.

695
00:44:49.062 --> 00:44:53.358
[Jennings] We're going flat out
on working out a one-hour film.

696
00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:55.985
- [Oliver] What's the next film about?
- Well. FIFA.

697
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:57.612
[laughter]

698
00:44:57.695 --> 00:45:00.615
I think. as a journalist. you're always
hoping to get hold of the document

699
00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:03.701
that will absolutely nail the story.

700
00:45:04.786 --> 00:45:06.371
And it doesn't happen very often.

701
00:45:06.454 --> 00:45:07.956
[Jennings] Stupid sports reporters.

702
00:45:08.039 --> 00:45:10.667
[Oliver] We didn't have enough
to name names.

703
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.836
and nobody in the sport
will go on the record.

704
00:45:12.919 --> 00:45:14.212
[phone rings]

705
00:45:14.295 --> 00:45:17.257
Until Andrew got a call from a source.

706
00:45:18.675 --> 00:45:20.677
James. are you there?

707
00:45:30.478 --> 00:45:32.981
[Oliver] We flew out to meet someone.

708
00:45:35.817 --> 00:45:38.361
We didn't know how much
they were gonna tell us.

709
00:45:41.406 --> 00:45:44.451
And Andrew's kind of doing the pitch.

710
00:45:44.534 --> 00:45:49.539
"You know that any information
you give me. absolutely in confidence."

711
00:45:50.957 --> 00:45:52.917
I can see the guy's got his hand down

712
00:45:53.001 --> 00:45:57.422
and he's sort of pulling out
a couple of leaves of paper.

713
00:45:57.505 --> 00:45:59.424
pulling it half out.
and then it goes down again

714
00:45:59.507 --> 00:46:01.593
as Andrew keeps talking.
and then it comes up again.

715
00:46:01.676 --> 00:46:03.178
there's a gap. and then it's down.

716
00:46:03.261 --> 00:46:07.223
And I'm going. "Andrew. Andrew.
I think he's got something for us."

717
00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:11.019
[Jennings] Eventually I looked at it.
He reached into his briefcase.

718
00:46:11.102 --> 00:46:13.730
He produced some sheets of paper
and he said.

719
00:46:13.813 --> 00:46:16.691
"I think this is what
you've been waiting for."

720
00:46:17.984 --> 00:46:20.612
[Oliver] "I think this is what
you've been waiting for."

721
00:46:22.989 --> 00:46:26.034
And that was the ISL bribe list.

722
00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:28.411
A trusted source delivered the goods.

723
00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:30.371
[commentator speaks Spanish]

724
00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:34.459
[in Spanish] Goal!

725
00:46:35.084 --> 00:46:41.132
Goal!

726
00:46:41.216 --> 00:46:46.429
[Oliver] This had been something Andrew
had been after for God knows how long.

727
00:46:47.514 --> 00:46:55.396
I got hold of a list of 106 bribes
totalling 100 million US dollars.

728
00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.607
[Oliver] What made it so valuable to us

729
00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:01.861
was that in four cases.
names had been attached.

730
00:47:01.945 --> 00:47:05.949
We knew it. but we couldn't prove it.
and suddenly there was the proof.

731
00:47:06.032 --> 00:47:09.452
[Jennings] Havelange had
45 million US dollars. at least.

732
00:47:09.536 --> 00:47:14.415
for those fantastic really
non-tender contracts for the World Cup.

733
00:47:15.208 --> 00:47:17.335
[Oliver] "Holy grail" might sound
a bit over the top.

734
00:47:17.418 --> 00:47:21.422
but it was absolutely what we'd been
hoping for and wishing for

735
00:47:21.506 --> 00:47:24.551
and trying to find for a very long time.

736
00:47:25.426 --> 00:47:31.349
And then we had a few beers.
and I phoned my editor.

737
00:47:31.432 --> 00:47:34.060
We suddenly had evidence
against three of the people.

738
00:47:34.143 --> 00:47:36.479
the executive committee members.
who are about to vote

739
00:47:36.563 --> 00:47:40.024
on who should get
the 2018 and '22 World Cup.

740
00:47:42.694 --> 00:47:45.154
For a moment. that's triumph.

741
00:47:54.497 --> 00:47:57.500
- [bleep]
- [Panorama theme music]

742
00:47:57.584 --> 00:48:00.461
[reporter] Last night's "Panorama" claimed
that three of the men

743
00:48:00.545 --> 00:48:02.630
who will have a vote on Thursday

744
00:48:02.714 --> 00:48:05.425
took bribes
from a Swiss sports marketing firm.

745
00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:09.721
[interpreter] The FIFA members have been
slandered absolutely groundlessly.

746
00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:12.432
They want to compromise that organisation.

747
00:48:12.515 --> 00:48:15.101
The allegations were made
in a BBC television programme.

748
00:48:15.184 --> 00:48:16.644
Of course it has an impact.

749
00:48:16.728 --> 00:48:18.980
[reporter] The English bid team
is well aware of the damage

750
00:48:19.063 --> 00:48:21.816
that's likely to have been caused
to their campaign.

751
00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:26.738
There was this nationalist atmosphere:
don't rock the boat.

752
00:48:26.821 --> 00:48:29.115
[reporter]
There's no doubt that England 2018

753
00:48:29.198 --> 00:48:32.910
are worried about the possible fallout
from Monday's Panorama.

754
00:48:32.994 --> 00:48:38.082
The England Football Association
actually asking the BBC

755
00:48:38.166 --> 00:48:42.003
not to broadcast the programme.
which is just extraordinary.

756
00:48:42.086 --> 00:48:45.506
Is it frustrating that Panorama's doing
this programme a few days before?

757
00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:46.591
Of course it is.

758
00:48:46.674 --> 00:48:51.721
Just last week. the chief executive. Andy
Anson. described the BBC as unpatriotic.

759
00:48:51.804 --> 00:48:59.020
[Oliver] The Sun newspaper's headline
was "BBC Brainless Betraying Cretinous".

760
00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:00.605
And that was us.

761
00:49:01.356 --> 00:49:05.276
[reporter] England's bid team say all of
this is upsetting some of the key voters.

762
00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.655
such as this man.
FIFA vice president Jack Warner.

763
00:49:08.738 --> 00:49:11.949
who claimed this week
the BBC had a death wish.

764
00:49:12.033 --> 00:49:16.079
[Oliver] I think the view was taken that
we were going to lose England the vote.

765
00:49:16.162 --> 00:49:18.790
I just would love the World Cup
to come to this country.

766
00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:21.501
I think it's long overdue.

767
00:49:21.584 --> 00:49:24.504
[Lineker] I was drafted in very late.

768
00:49:24.587 --> 00:49:27.298
When your country calls you.
you have to try and do your bit.

769
00:49:27.382 --> 00:49:30.301
although I thought
it was a bit of a late shout.

770
00:49:30.385 --> 00:49:32.512
[reporter] Footballers. prime ministers

771
00:49:32.595 --> 00:49:36.099
and even our future king
are descending on Zurich.

772
00:49:37.225 --> 00:49:41.354
The challenge for the English delegation
is to negate the impact of this.

773
00:49:42.021 --> 00:49:44.190
In the past few minutes.
FIFA has issued a statement

774
00:49:44.273 --> 00:49:46.734
saying that the allegations
made in the BBC programme

775
00:49:46.818 --> 00:49:49.779
refer to a case dating back many years

776
00:49:49.862 --> 00:49:53.950
and that the investigation and the case
are definitely closed.

777
00:49:54.826 --> 00:49:57.161
[Mersiades] Then they just did
the usual thing of saying.

778
00:49:57.245 --> 00:50:00.081
"Well. this is all old stuff.
We knew all this."

779
00:50:00.164 --> 00:50:03.042
Yet. in fact. they didn't.
because the list with the names

780
00:50:03.126 --> 00:50:05.795
and the amounts of money
and the dates on which it was transferred

781
00:50:05.878 --> 00:50:08.005
had not been previously known
or published.

782
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:09.799
And yet the reception was.

783
00:50:09.882 --> 00:50:13.094
"Don't take any notice of him
cos he's a discredited moron.

784
00:50:14.637 --> 00:50:15.930
People should just ignore it."

785
00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:18.725
And that's precisely what they did.

786
00:50:20.476 --> 00:50:24.647
[Lineker] It was the night
before the vote to decide.

787
00:50:24.731 --> 00:50:27.108
I thought it was extraordinarily odd.

788
00:50:28.401 --> 00:50:30.820
because when I looked around the room.

789
00:50:31.904 --> 00:50:36.033
all the other countries
that were bidding weren't there.

790
00:50:36.117 --> 00:50:38.369
And I thought to myself. I thought.

791
00:50:38.453 --> 00:50:41.080
"This is all decided.
Everybody knows what's happening here."

792
00:50:42.707 --> 00:50:45.877
Cos it was just
so obviously. obviously corrupt.

793
00:50:48.796 --> 00:50:51.257
[reporter] England has just finished.
and now Russia is making

794
00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:53.801
its final presentation
in front of the FIFA executives.

795
00:50:53.885 --> 00:50:57.930
This is the last pitch
before the decision. the voting process.

796
00:50:58.014 --> 00:50:59.766
[newsreader]
We're less than two hours away.

797
00:50:59.849 --> 00:51:04.437
FIFA is set to reveal host countries
for the World Cup in 2018 and 2022.

798
00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:08.441
It's the first time that they have ever
announced back-to-back bids.

799
00:51:08.524 --> 00:51:12.111
The US is a strong candidate for 2022.

800
00:51:12.195 --> 00:51:16.824
The FIFA executive committee has
undertaken the voting a few minutes ago.

801
00:51:17.533 --> 00:51:20.411
The president will announce the results
of the voting.

802
00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:23.831
[Blatter] It has been explained to you.

803
00:51:23.915 --> 00:51:27.960
we have to give two World Cups
on the same day.

804
00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:32.799
Big. big compliments to all the bidders.

805
00:51:32.882 --> 00:51:36.427
accompanied
by their political dignitaries.

806
00:51:36.511 --> 00:51:41.307
They have all delivered messages
saying that football is more than a game.

807
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:46.103
So. ladies and gentlemen.
everybody is now awaiting

808
00:51:46.187 --> 00:51:51.150
the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

809
00:51:51.234 --> 00:51:54.737
2018 FIFA World Cup. ladies and gentlemen.

810
00:51:54.821 --> 00:51:57.949
will be organised in Russia.

811
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.333
[Lineker]
When Russia won. that was a huge blow.

812
00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:12.296
They were shocked. absolutely shocked.

813
00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:14.048
Congratulations to Russia.

814
00:52:14.966 --> 00:52:18.344
[Lineker] But the 2022 one
was… was gobsmacking.

815
00:52:18.427 --> 00:52:21.556
The winner to organise

816
00:52:21.639 --> 00:52:25.351
the 2022 FIFA World Cup…

817
00:52:29.897 --> 00:52:31.107
is Qatar.

818
00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.369
You just thought. "How?"

819
00:52:44.203 --> 00:52:45.872
And I remember
sitting in that auditorium.

820
00:52:45.955 --> 00:52:48.916
and I felt like I needed to get back
to the hotel and have a shower.

821
00:52:50.126 --> 00:52:51.210
It just felt dirty.

822
00:52:52.336 --> 00:52:54.422
And they won it easily.

823
00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:59.385
[Mersiades] Qatar in particular
was such a surprise to everybody.

824
00:52:59.468 --> 00:53:00.761
They won it so quickly.

825
00:53:00.845 --> 00:53:02.263
In four votes. it was over.

826
00:53:09.103 --> 00:53:12.064
Almost from that second.
FIFA knew that it was in trouble.

827
00:53:12.148 --> 00:53:14.984
There's stories of Jérôme Valcke.
the second in command.

828
00:53:15.067 --> 00:53:18.905
rocking and shaking his head
at the back of the communications bus

829
00:53:18.988 --> 00:53:21.616
as they go back to headquarters.
saying. "FIFA is over."

830
00:53:21.699 --> 00:53:24.911
This has been. you know…
This has been a step too far.

831
00:53:25.703 --> 00:53:29.540
The prime minister gave us support.
the way Prince William gave us support.

832
00:53:29.624 --> 00:53:32.251
the way. you know.
everyone performed up there with…

833
00:53:32.335 --> 00:53:36.422
I think it was a mixture of emotions
to be ridiculed in that way

834
00:53:36.505 --> 00:53:38.883
by losing out at the first stage.

835
00:53:38.966 --> 00:53:43.346
to not get any votes.
just one in the first round.

836
00:53:44.388 --> 00:53:46.849
There was a degree of panic
as to how this would be seen.

837
00:53:46.933 --> 00:53:49.685
I certainly know one thing. which is
when it comes to breaking promises.

838
00:53:49.769 --> 00:53:52.104
politicians have got nothing
on football management.

839
00:53:52.188 --> 00:53:55.149
- I… I. um…
- [laughter and cheering]

840
00:53:57.276 --> 00:54:01.030
[reporter] After pouring $45 million
into a World Cup campaign.

841
00:54:01.113 --> 00:54:03.574
Australia received just one vote.

842
00:54:03.658 --> 00:54:07.244
I'm bitterly disappointed.
disappointed for you.

843
00:54:07.328 --> 00:54:12.792
[man] Why decide to put a World Cup
in Qatar. which is vastly too hot.

844
00:54:12.875 --> 00:54:16.712
against the advice
of their own safety committee?

845
00:54:17.505 --> 00:54:21.842
50 degrees Celsius
is 122 degrees Fahrenheit.

846
00:54:21.926 --> 00:54:25.721
You are hosting the World Cup somewhere
where soccer cannot physically be played.

847
00:54:25.805 --> 00:54:28.599
They are not a football country.

848
00:54:28.683 --> 00:54:33.062
Uh. the level… football level
is very low in this country.

849
00:54:34.105 --> 00:54:36.148
[man] I think it's unusual.
to say the least.

850
00:54:36.232 --> 00:54:39.235
to hold an event
of this extraordinary magnitude

851
00:54:39.318 --> 00:54:41.404
in a country. in effect. of one city.

852
00:54:42.405 --> 00:54:46.367
The silver lining of those two countries
winning it. and particularly Qatar.

853
00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:50.162
because it seemed such
a nonsensical decision on the face of it.

854
00:54:50.246 --> 00:54:54.291
was that it started to make people
ask questions about FIFA.

855
00:54:54.959 --> 00:54:59.672
Russia gets the bid in '18
and Qatar gets it in 2022.

856
00:54:59.755 --> 00:55:01.799
Is it possible
that they just wanna give it to places

857
00:55:01.882 --> 00:55:03.759
that have never had the World Cup before?

858
00:55:03.843 --> 00:55:05.845
It's possible that they wanna grow
those markets.

859
00:55:05.928 --> 00:55:08.597
although I don't know
what the market in Qatar is exactly.

860
00:55:09.807 --> 00:55:12.268
[reporter] Now. you may not know much
about Qatar's soccer team.

861
00:55:12.351 --> 00:55:15.604
They've never qualified for the World Cup.
Now automatically they're gonna get in.

862
00:55:15.688 --> 00:55:20.526
Pretty big coup. to say the least. for
a country that only existed since 1971.

863
00:55:26.574 --> 00:55:28.200
The most interesting thing about Qatar

864
00:55:28.284 --> 00:55:31.287
is the huge differences
inside the country.

865
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:35.374
They are really rich.
they live in fancy buildings.

866
00:55:35.458 --> 00:55:38.919
and then you have the migrant workers
who are building all this.

867
00:55:39.003 --> 00:55:41.088
They are definitely not from Qatar.

868
00:55:41.172 --> 00:55:43.174
They come from all around the world.

869
00:55:44.425 --> 00:55:46.385
[Hill] The issue for Qatar has always been

870
00:55:46.469 --> 00:55:49.930
that it's a small.
extraordinary rich country

871
00:55:50.014 --> 00:55:52.475
and almost indefensible by hard power.

872
00:55:55.394 --> 00:55:58.022
Their nightmare.
their collective nightmare.

873
00:55:58.105 --> 00:56:01.692
was what had happened
to the Kuwaitis in 1989.

874
00:56:01.776 --> 00:56:05.071
This conflict started
when the dictator of Iraq

875
00:56:05.154 --> 00:56:07.698
invaded a small and helpless neighbour.

876
00:56:09.158 --> 00:56:11.035
[Hill] The Qataris looked at this. said.

877
00:56:11.118 --> 00:56:13.329
"We've gotta figure out
a way of defending ourselves

878
00:56:13.412 --> 00:56:15.456
by building soft power."

879
00:56:16.207 --> 00:56:19.043
That's why we see Qatar
going on a massive spending spree

880
00:56:19.126 --> 00:56:21.837
over the past few years. you know.
buying banks in the region.

881
00:56:21.921 --> 00:56:24.173
buying trophy assets.
buying Paris Saint-Germain.

882
00:56:24.256 --> 00:56:27.468
[Hill]
Which was the French establishment team.

883
00:56:27.551 --> 00:56:32.056
They spent 220 million euro
on just one player.

884
00:56:32.139 --> 00:56:34.934
[reporter] This absolutely shatters
the previous world record fee.

885
00:56:35.017 --> 00:56:38.521
which was around the $115 million mark.

886
00:56:38.604 --> 00:56:40.356
This is all part of the strategy. Richard.

887
00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:47.988
[Hill] This was a few weeks after Saudi
Arabia had surrounded Qatar in a blockade.

888
00:56:49.573 --> 00:56:52.701
The President of France.
Emmanuel Macron. that time.

889
00:56:52.785 --> 00:56:57.873
flies to Saudi Arabia to help.
quote. "negotiate" on behalf of Qatar

890
00:56:57.957 --> 00:57:01.752
and end the blockade with Saudi Arabia.

891
00:57:01.836 --> 00:57:04.130
[newsreader] Saudi Arabia announced
the kingdom is ending

892
00:57:04.213 --> 00:57:06.882
its embargo of the Arab state.

893
00:57:06.966 --> 00:57:11.512
[Hill] That is an extraordinarily
effective tactic of soft power.

894
00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:14.849
when you consider the expense
and the resources needed for hard power.

895
00:57:14.932 --> 00:57:17.017
relatively cheap.

896
00:57:17.101 --> 00:57:18.644
If they had bought a fighter jet.

897
00:57:18.727 --> 00:57:21.188
it would have cost them 500 million euro

898
00:57:21.272 --> 00:57:26.026
and it wouldn't have stopped a Saudi
invasion by more than 15. 20 minutes.

899
00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:28.279
but by buying one football player.

900
00:57:28.362 --> 00:57:31.991
they were able to help
bring an end to this blockade.

901
00:57:33.993 --> 00:57:37.538
[newsreader] Allegations that Qatar
bought its way to hosting the World Cup

902
00:57:37.621 --> 00:57:41.333
have been vigorously denied
by the chief executive of Qatar's bid.

903
00:57:41.417 --> 00:57:43.669
Speaking for the first time
since their victory.

904
00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:46.130
Hassan Al Thawadi told the BBC

905
00:57:46.213 --> 00:57:49.383
that claims of corruption
were based on prejudice.

906
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:51.135
Absolute outrage. Why?

907
00:57:51.218 --> 00:57:53.137
If there's evidence.
investigate the evidence.

908
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:57.057
I agree with that completely. and
we've always said that. Please go ahead.

909
00:57:57.141 --> 00:57:59.727
But there's no evidence.
there's nothing there.

910
00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:01.812
and it's based on rumours.

911
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:07.985
I witnessed 1.5 million dollars
being offered to three Exco members

912
00:58:08.068 --> 00:58:12.823
in exchange for them
to vote for the Qatar 2022 bid.

913
00:58:15.159 --> 00:58:17.328
[Jennings] Nobody wants to go to Qatar.

914
00:58:18.495 --> 00:58:21.498
The fans don't wanna go.
The footballers don't wanna go.

915
00:58:21.582 --> 00:58:23.626
The clubs don't wanna let them go.

916
00:58:25.002 --> 00:58:27.588
What has Qatar done
to deserve this honour?

917
00:58:27.671 --> 00:58:29.715
Forced labour of migrant workers.

918
00:58:29.798 --> 00:58:32.843
death penalty for same-sex relations
and blasphemy.

919
00:58:32.927 --> 00:58:35.179
flogging for alcohol consumption.

920
00:58:35.262 --> 00:58:37.097
a ban on all political parties.

921
00:58:37.181 --> 00:58:39.266
the guardianship system for women.

922
00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:42.978
and major restrictions
on freedom of expression.

923
00:58:43.062 --> 00:58:44.855
This is Qatar's track record.

924
00:58:44.939 --> 00:58:48.651
[reporter] Fans. knowing that there are
designated spots where you can drink.

925
00:58:48.734 --> 00:58:51.278
will overconsume alcohol
to make up for it.

926
00:58:51.362 --> 00:58:54.156
This is turning into
a Fyre Festival sort of deal.

927
00:58:55.241 --> 00:58:59.203
Qatar is a huge. huge problem
for the sport.

928
00:58:59.286 --> 00:59:00.287
In fact. Beckham himself.

929
00:59:00.371 --> 00:59:02.957
I don't really understand
why he's getting involved with this.

930
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.375
He's extremely rich already.

931
00:59:04.458 --> 00:59:05.459
I'll be there.

932
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:07.419
[man] I mean. he's worth
about 400 million pounds.

933
00:59:07.503 --> 00:59:09.797
Is it gonna make a big difference to him?

934
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.841
[man 2] Critics of Qatar will say.
"They're buying their way into the books.

935
00:59:12.925 --> 00:59:15.970
into the favours of governments
and organisations."

936
00:59:16.053 --> 00:59:19.265
Protests have been building up.
and I think they will go on building up.

937
00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:24.561
And that's why journalists
named the people

938
00:59:24.645 --> 00:59:29.149
who really gave it
to the Gulf and to Putin.

939
00:59:30.067 --> 00:59:31.902

[Goldblatt] I think we should remember
that the Qatar World Cup

944
00:59:51.797 --> 00:59:57.886
was awarded at the same time that Russia
was awarded the 2018 World Cup.

945
00:59:57.970 --> 01:00:00.931
And it always strikes me as odd
that Russia.

946
01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:04.059
who was an authoritarian society.

947
01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.563
is sort of waved through.

948
01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:12.318
[reporter] More allegations of bribery
emerged in the British press on Sunday.

949
01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:17.364
The most sensational allegation of all
was that Russian President Vladimir Putin

950
01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:23.287
allegedly bought European football chief
Michel Platini a rare Picasso painting.

951
01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:28.876

[applause]

Ladies and gentlemen. we are honoured
to win in this tough and fair fight.

954
01:00:40.179 --> 01:00:42.181
You can take my word for it.

955
01:00:42.264 --> 01:00:48.937
the 2018 World Cup in Russia
will be up to the highest standards.

956
01:00:49.021 --> 01:00:53.859
Now. here's the thing. Putin has already
won this World Cup just by getting it.

957
01:00:56.779 --> 01:01:00.616
Russia as a whole. tourists now see it
as this. like. open. fun place.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:03.702
- Russia's the best!
- Russia forever! Russia!

959
01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:07.039
We believe that politics
should be independent from football.

960
01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:09.958
Russia's operations
in the world of football

961
01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:14.296
have been very smart. very slick
and very organised.

962
01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.216
I mean. when you've got
a world-class intelligence agency

963
01:01:17.299 --> 01:01:19.051
that you're prepared to use.

964
01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:21.553
who wants to go and investigate Russia?

965
01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:25.933
[reporter] Russia's human rights record
is poor. to say the least.

966
01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.518
And Putin wants to break out of that.

967
01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.603
He wants to say.
"Russia's not what you think.

968
01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:34.316
Russia is not the evil empire.
even though there's problems between us."

969
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.487
[Goldblatt] And the Garcia Report. which
was FIFA's response to these allegations.

970
01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:42.241
you know. they went to the Russians
and said. "We wanna see your emails."

971
01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:44.493
And they said. "You can't see our emails."

972
01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:47.871
"Why can't we see your emails?
They're all on your server."

973
01:01:47.955 --> 01:01:51.333
And they said.
"Oh. yes. the server… burnt in a fire."

974
01:01:54.962 --> 01:01:56.839
[Mersiades] So what did they do?

975
01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:59.007
Garcia. after this very expensive report.

976
01:01:59.091 --> 01:02:03.303
in which he travelled around the world
in typical FIFA luxury.

977
01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:06.932
he came out with a report which said
there was nothing to see with Russia.

978
01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:08.934
there was nothing to see with Qatar.

979
01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.894
[reporter]
Qatar and Russia were cleared today.

980
01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:13.730
even though the Russians said. basically.
"The dog ate my homework".

981
01:02:13.814 --> 01:02:16.483
and FIFA just accepted this
and cleared them.

982
01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:20.863
This just makes a mockery
of the organisation. doesn't it?

983
01:02:20.946 --> 01:02:24.908
Well. it's very Kafkaesque. I guess.
is the best way to put it. and very FIFA.

984
01:02:25.868 --> 01:02:28.579
[Szymanski] This is not the first time
we've seen FIFA

985
01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.956
turning its back on political issues

986
01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:35.043
and turning a blind eye
to unsavoury regimes

987
01:02:35.127 --> 01:02:37.671
with which they were doing business.

988
01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.674
The 1978 World Cup happened
in the middle of the Dirty War.

989
01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:43.177
a period of time in Argentina

990
01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.514
when a military dictatorship took over
for the democratically elected government

991
01:02:47.598 --> 01:02:50.476
and started going around

992
01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:53.562
and they started disappearing people.

993
01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:56.690
They would take them
to these concentration camps.

994
01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:59.443
They would basically torture them
till they named names.

995
01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:00.527
[cheering]

996
01:03:00.611 --> 01:03:06.158
People in a concentration camp
could hear the cheers from the stadium.

997
01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:11.038
which is not that far away
from where they were being tortured.

998
01:03:13.332 --> 01:03:16.001
And then the people they tortured.

999
01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:18.712
they would take them up in airplanes

1000
01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.924
and throw them out alive.

1001
01:03:25.761 --> 01:03:29.056
[in Spanish] They're not here.
neither dead or alive. They are missing.

1002
01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:34.520
[Wright Thompson] The night
that Argentina won the 1978 World Cup.

1003
01:03:34.603 --> 01:03:38.982
they drove prisoners
through the celebration. as if to say.

1004
01:03:39.066 --> 01:03:43.445
"They don't care about you.
They don't even know that you're missing.

1005
01:03:43.529 --> 01:03:47.699
The joy of this has washed
even your existence away."

1006
01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:52.663
Sportswashing.
it's existed for a very long time.

1007
01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:58.710
But in modern times. unfortunately.
we're seeing that getting worse.

1008
01:03:59.836 --> 01:04:01.547
We've seen it in motor racing.

1009
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:05.133
We've seen it in…
We've seen cricket playing out there.

1010
01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:07.094
There's been obviously golf now.

1011
01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:11.807
with the whole LIV tour
and how that's torn golf apart.

1012
01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:14.768
Sportswashing makes you forget
a country's crimes.

1013
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:16.186
the human rights abuses.

1014
01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:18.647
Instead you see
the wonderful opening ceremonies.

1015
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:21.024
you see hundreds of athletes
enjoying themselves.

1016
01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:25.487
As viewers. we cannot make a difference
here. but the sporting bodies can.

1017
01:04:25.571 --> 01:04:27.906
So can the sponsors and governments.

1018
01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:34.830
[newsreader] The title of your article.
"Soccer Needs To Kick Out Its Dictator".

1019
01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:39.042
Explain why Sepp Blatter.
in your words. is a dictator.

1020
01:04:39.126 --> 01:04:43.672
Well. Sepp Blatter has been at…
with FIFA since 1975.

1021
01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:48.760
There's nobody else inside FIFA
who could stand up to him.

1022
01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.349
[Togoni] Bin Hammam was upset.

1023
01:04:54.433 --> 01:04:57.686
He supported Blatter
for his election in 1998.

1024
01:04:57.769 --> 01:05:00.022
Blatter said he will not stay
like Havelange forever.

1025
01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:03.275
He promised to step down after two terms.

1026
01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:05.569
But Blatter then. he cancelled this.

1027
01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:10.282
Blatter went for a third term
and he was trying to go for a fourth term.

1028
01:05:11.992 --> 01:05:15.203
[Goldblatt]
In 2011. Bin Hammam. he's manoeuvring

1029
01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:19.625
and thinking Blatter's upset enough
people. now is the moment to strike.

1030
01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:24.421
So Mo. as I like to call him.
calls Jack and says.

1031
01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:28.300
"Concacaf has 35 votes.
Jack. get your people together."

1032
01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:32.721
Jack calls a special meeting
of the Caribbean Football Union

1033
01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:36.975
and they all meet in the Royal Hyatt
in Port-of-Spain in Trinidad.

1034
01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:40.479
And Jack gives a speech. which is actually
recorded. where he basically says.

1035
01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:45.484
"This is a gift from Qatar.
Just think of this as a goodwill gift."

1036
01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:49.237
$40.000 in cash in brown envelopes.

1037
01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:52.574
an actual brown Manila envelope

1038
01:05:52.658 --> 01:05:57.829
for every single president
of every single Caribbean federation.

1039
01:05:57.913 --> 01:06:03.293
[Warner] The gift you get is for you
to determine how best you want to use it.

1040
01:06:03.377 --> 01:06:07.839
and if there is anybody here
who has a conscience

1041
01:06:07.923 --> 01:06:10.300
and wishes to send back the money.

1042
01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:14.054
I am willing to take it and give it back
to him at the end of the month.

1043
01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:18.308
The new exploitation
is a new form of colonialism.

1044
01:06:18.392 --> 01:06:20.185
Give the buggers money
and they'll vote for us.

1045
01:06:20.268 --> 01:06:22.396
That's how Blatter won the last election.

1046
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:26.608
Cos what would you do
if you were penniless in Rwanda

1047
01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:31.113
and a guy from the Gulf turned up
and offered you 10.000 US dollars to vote?

1048
01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:35.117
What do you say to your wife and kids?
What do you say to them?

1049
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.954
[Warner] There are some people here
who believe they are more pious than thou.

1050
01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:42.624
If you are pious.
open a church. friends. right?

1051
01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:46.211
But the fact is
our business is our business.

1052
01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:50.799
[Goldblatt] This is our business.
Business doesn't go out of this room.

1053
01:06:50.882 --> 01:06:53.635
But some people
have a moment of conscience.

1054
01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:56.680
and a couple of them
actually phone Chuck Blazer.

1055
01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:58.765
Chuck Blazer. back in New York.

1056
01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:03.353
Blazer can't believe this. It's so brazen.
Even for Chuck Blazer.

1057
01:07:03.437 --> 01:07:06.440
And Chuck panics.
And is this gonna get out?

1058
01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.191
And are they gonna call FIFA?

1059
01:07:08.275 --> 01:07:11.445
And how is this gonna look?
And am I gonna get caught?

1060
01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:15.282
And he calls FIFA. He calls Blatter
that weekend and spills the beans.

1061
01:07:18.452 --> 01:07:23.039
And of course Blatter is delighted
that his upstart competitor. Bin Hammam.

1062
01:07:23.123 --> 01:07:24.791
has been caught red-handed.

1063
01:07:25.876 --> 01:07:28.086
[reporter] According to sources
I've spoken to tonight.

1064
01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.380
Bin Hammam and Warner are accused

1065
01:07:30.464 --> 01:07:34.509
of trying to bribe Caribbean
football officials with bundles of cash

1066
01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:38.847
in return for supporting Bin Hammam
in next week's FIFA vote.

1067
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.515
[Goldblatt] Blatter put the news out:

1068
01:07:40.599 --> 01:07:44.895
Chuck Blazer is the honest whistleblower
in all of this.

1069
01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:48.607
[reporter] And here's the whistleblower.
American official Chuck Blazer.

1070
01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:51.067
His dossier of evidence
will now be considered

1071
01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:54.321
by FIFA's ethics committee
on Sunday.

1072
01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:59.326
Crisis? What is the crisis?
We are not in a crisis.

1073
01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.912
We are only in some difficulties.

1074
01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:06.416
and these difficulties will be solved.
will be solved inside our family.

1075
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.502
[applause]

1076
01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.270
[applause]

1077
01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:33.109
[reporter]
FIFA did its best to keep up the pretence.

1078
01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:37.948
taking trouble to count all 186 votes
which Blatter polled today.

1079
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:40.158
But it didn't take too long.
and here's why.

1080
01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:43.036
And they should at least
have added a second box

1081
01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:46.623
so that your options weren't
vote Blatter or go [bleep] yourself.

1082
01:08:47.541 --> 01:08:49.626
Given that the re-election of Sepp Blatter

1083
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:52.629
has brought FIFA
even further into disrepute.

1084
01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:54.798
will he take this opportunity
to voice his support

1085
01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.800
for those who are calling
for the reforms we need

1086
01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:58.927
to finally show Mr Blatter the red card?

1087
01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.178
Hear! Hear!

1088
01:09:00.262 --> 01:09:04.891
They're furious in America.
you guys are furious in Australia.

1089
01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:08.186
the Dutch are also angry.
and slowly the temperature is going up.

1090
01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:10.397
At last it's going up in England

1091
01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:16.736
over the way these people have made
fools of us and fools of you as well.

1092
01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:19.489
The election with just one candidate
was something of a farce.

1093
01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:22.367
but ultimately change
has got to come from within football.

1094
01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:26.413
[Oliver] Football itself
seemed incapable of dealing with it.

1095
01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:28.540
Still I hear sports reporters going.

1096
01:09:28.623 --> 01:09:31.418
"Well. I think President Blatter
wants to reform."

1097
01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:33.920
And you just think.
"What are they smoking?

1098
01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:37.424
Was Mr Capone gonna close down
the mafia in Chicago?

1099
01:09:37.507 --> 01:09:38.758
Can we get real about this?"

1100
01:09:38.842 --> 01:09:41.344
I think we should really do something.

1101
01:09:41.428 --> 01:09:46.099
but you should keep in mind
we are not so powerful.

1102
01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:49.144
[Andersen] I'm sorry to say this.
because I know that the US

1103
01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:53.481
is sometimes a little overeager
imposing its order in this world.

1104
01:09:53.565 --> 01:09:57.861
but the Europeans talk and discuss

1105
01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:01.615
and make recommendations
and resolutions. then guidelines.

1106
01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:10.040
But nothing in international sport
really changes until the cavalry comes.

1107
01:10:17.172 --> 01:10:19.507
[Jennings] The FBI came looking for me.

1108
01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:23.011
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
the G-men.

1109
01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:24.804
the one with the curly bits in their ears.

1110
01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:27.807
I saw all their business cards.
They were the real thing.

1111
01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:32.270
But they weren't coming to take me away.
They wanted to talk to me.

1112
01:10:32.354 --> 01:10:36.149
They wanted to know what I knew.
having spent years investigating FIFA.

1113
01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:40.362
I got hold of Chuck Blazer's reports
at Concacaf.

1114
01:10:40.445 --> 01:10:44.115
and it showed
that he was stealing so much money

1115
01:10:44.199 --> 01:10:46.576
and he wasn't paying tax on it.
the naughty boy.

1116
01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:49.746
And I actually spoke to the feds and said.

1117
01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:53.375
"Look. I think I should maybe give these
to the Internal Revenue Service.

1118
01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:56.086
because here's tax evasion.
or I could give them to you."

1119
01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:59.798
And the fella said. "Mr Jennings.
I can't tell you what to do.

1120
01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:01.716
but I'd really like to see them."

1121
01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:05.053
So I emailed them over. They read them.

1122
01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:08.807
Within a few days. I think.
Chuck Blazer was lifted.

1123
01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:11.685
and he rolled over. as we say.

1124
01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:15.605
This is what they did. They went to him
and said. "Chuck. you are fired.

1125
01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:19.693
Either you work with us or you go to jail
for the rest of your life.

1126
01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:22.737
and you will be sentenced
and we will take away everything."

1127
01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:29.744
They gave him a recording device
in a key fob.

1128
01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:37.460
He also recorded a lot of telephone calls
to his apartment and offices.

1129
01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:43.216
He recorded a bunch of people
for several years.

1130
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.680
[Andersen]
He brings his key to the London Olympics.

1131
01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:51.975
He put it on the table.
talks to his friends.

1132
01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:57.230
"Do you remember the good old days
when we made this TV deal?

1133
01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.315
You got way too much out of it."

1134
01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:02.694
"No. I only got 10 million."

1135
01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:15.749
Chuck Blazer was the glue.

1136
01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:21.129
It was not what we would call a hard flip.

1137
01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:23.757
There really is no other option for him.

1138
01:12:24.716 --> 01:12:28.470
I feel betrayed. This shouldn't be…
This shouldn't happen.

1139
01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:31.598
But. I mean. decisions are taken to…

1140
01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.100
ultimately to punish those
who've transgressed.

1141
01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:36.144
[siren wails]

1142
01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:38.688
[Frankel] He's the one who gives us.

1143
01:12:38.772 --> 01:12:43.359
"That guy's dirty.
that guy's dirty. that guy's dirty."

1144
01:12:44.152 --> 01:12:46.738
In other words. a home run.

1145
01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:49.532
[cheering]

1146
01:12:49.616 --> 01:12:52.494
[newsreader] As FIFA officials gathered
for their annual meeting

1147
01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:56.164
at a luxury hotel in Zurich.
Swiss authorities made their move.

1148
01:12:56.247 --> 01:13:00.210
Shortly after breakfast.
they entered individual hotel rooms.

1149
01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:04.672
[newsreader 2] The biggest scandal ever
in the world's biggest sport

1150
01:13:04.756 --> 01:13:06.758
unfolded in dramatic fashion this morning

1151
01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:08.802
with arrests in Zurich. Switzerland.

1152
01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:10.678
[newsreader 3]
Swiss authorities were acting

1153
01:13:10.762 --> 01:13:12.931
at the request
of the US Attorney General's office.

1154
01:13:13.014 --> 01:13:16.518
[newsreader 4] Interpol issues red notices
for six FIFA executives

1155
01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.853
wanted by the US Attorney General.

1156
01:13:18.937 --> 01:13:20.730
I've been waiting for this
because. of course.

1157
01:13:20.814 --> 01:13:24.192
I've been talking to the FBI
for six years now.

1158
01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:27.195
and I gave them
a lot of the documentation.

1159
01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:30.990
[Oliver] It turned out a lot of the
bribery had gone through banks in the US.

1160
01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:33.868
the United States claiming jurisdiction.

1161
01:13:33.952 --> 01:13:37.747
[newsreader] Just hours after the arrest
of FIFA officials in Switzerland.

1162
01:13:37.831 --> 01:13:41.751
US prosecutors in New York
were laying out the case against them.

1163
01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:44.838
The 47-count indictment
against these individuals

1164
01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:48.133
includes charges
of racketeering. wire fraud

1165
01:13:48.216 --> 01:13:51.761
and money laundering conspiracies
spanning two decades.

1166
01:13:51.845 --> 01:13:54.556
What took so long? What the [bleep]?

1167
01:13:54.639 --> 01:14:00.353
[Frankel] What has been revealed so far
is a mafia-style crime syndicate.

1168
01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:02.021
[Oliver] When he read that indictment.

1169
01:14:02.105 --> 01:14:05.024
not only vindicated
the journalism we had done

1170
01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:07.610
in that there was a corruption problem.

1171
01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:13.700
but. beyond that. clearly the FBI agreed
that this was organised crime.

1172
01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:15.368
and that's what it was.

1173
01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:18.913
US prosecutors say
briefcases full of cash

1174
01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:23.418
decided media and marketing rights.
even the site of the World Cup.

1175
01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:29.674
What the American investigators found
was a system of corruption

1176
01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:33.595
that tainted almost everything
inside that organisation.

1177
01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:37.765
And as you go through the dozens of pages
around the FIFA indictments

1178
01:14:37.849 --> 01:14:40.351
and the eventual convictions
and the plea bargains.

1179
01:14:40.435 --> 01:14:42.770
you see that there was corruption
in the broadcast rights.

1180
01:14:42.854 --> 01:14:46.274
corruption in the ticketing rights.
corruption in the sponsorship.

1181
01:14:46.357 --> 01:14:48.985
there was corruption
in the venue hostings.

1182
01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:53.698
Almost everything that FIFA
could touch in a business way

1183
01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:55.575
had in some way been corrupted.

1184
01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:58.077
[newsreader]
The former vice president of FIFA

1185
01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:01.956
spent nearly seven million in bribes
to secure the World Cup for Qatar.

1186
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:06.794
Andrew Jennings. Thomas Kistner.
and Jens Weinreich were ecstatic.

1187
01:15:07.754 --> 01:15:12.884
For seven. eight. ten. fifteen years.
they had been told they were obsessed.

1188
01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:18.014
that they were negative. that they were
only out to make harm to sport.

1189
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.809
You can imagine
that having these facts confirmed.

1190
01:15:21.893 --> 01:15:24.187
it was way beyond their imagination.

1191
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.814
I rang Andrew straightaway
and he was already packing

1192
01:15:26.898 --> 01:15:30.443
to get on a train to Zurich.
to enjoy the moment.

1193
01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:32.820
And he thoroughly deserved to.

1194
01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:35.323
That's what we do.
We're not here to be loved.

1195
01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:37.700
We're here to get the bloody story.

1196
01:15:38.618 --> 01:15:41.955
We are talking about
hundreds of millions of dollars.

1197
01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:46.209
So when you see pictures from around
the world of kids barefoot playing soccer.

1198
01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:48.169
know that they could have had boots.

1199
01:15:48.253 --> 01:15:51.714
they could have had good uniforms.
they could have had good pitches.

1200
01:15:51.798 --> 01:15:55.468
but the thieves running FIFA
took the money for themselves.

1201
01:15:57.053 --> 01:16:00.223
[Lynch] I want to make clear
that the defendants arrested this morning

1202
01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:03.601
will receive a fair trial
if they are brought to this country.

1203
01:16:03.685 --> 01:16:06.396
If you listen very carefully.
if you hold that microphone up.

1204
01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:08.481
you might hear the sobbing.

1205
01:16:15.655 --> 01:16:19.993
When they sent me to prison yesterday.
they thought they would have broken me.

1206
01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.995
On the other hand.
they have made me stronger.

1207
01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:25.665
The Americans are trying
to put the hurt on FIFA

1208
01:16:25.748 --> 01:16:27.333
since they did not get the World Cup.

1209
01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:32.338
[reporter] A source close
to the US investigation has told the BBC

1210
01:16:32.422 --> 01:16:36.676
they're working through 75 bank accounts
connected to Jack Warner

1211
01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:40.888
but admit some of FIFA's missing millions
may never be found.

1212
01:16:40.972 --> 01:16:47.812
And we still do not know today
where 70% of the bribes ended up.

1213
01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:55.611
[woman]
One citizen brings us into disrepute.

1214
01:16:55.695 --> 01:16:58.072
has brought us into shame and humiliation.

1215
01:16:58.156 --> 01:16:59.490
One citizen.

1216
01:16:59.574 --> 01:17:04.495
He should do all that he can
to cooperate with the US authorities.

1217
01:17:04.579 --> 01:17:07.248
[Warner] The member asked me to cooperate
with the US authorities.

1218
01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:10.001
but. Mr Speaker.
I tell this house and this country.

1219
01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:13.671
I tell you today
that I will have the last laugh.

1220
01:17:13.755 --> 01:17:16.966
[newsreader] Of the 24 members
on the executive committee.

1221
01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:21.971
14 have been indicted or implicated
in the corruption scandal.

1222
01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:24.223
Another three have retired.

1223
01:17:24.307 --> 01:17:28.686
leaving just seven of the original group
on the current executive committee.

1224
01:17:30.355 --> 01:17:33.816
The other part of the focus obviously
is Sepp Blatter himself. the president.

1225
01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.736
Now. he's up for re-election on Friday.

1226
01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:40.615
It seems inconceivable
that he could possibly be re-elected.

1227
01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:41.741
Do you think he could be?

1228
01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:47.246
If it was a normal organisation.
I would say no. but FIFA's not normal.

1229
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.082
FIFA is not corrupt.

1230
01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:50.833
- Definitely not.
- [applause]

1231
01:17:53.461 --> 01:17:54.587
[man] It's a disgrace!

1232
01:17:59.384 --> 01:18:01.803
You should be banned
from football for years!

1233
01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:04.514
Not a lot of good things have happened
with Sepp Blatter as president.

1234
01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:06.933
[in Portuguese]
They all need to go to prison!

1235
01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:11.479
As a football fan and loving the game.
it's kind of a slap in the face.

1236
01:18:11.562 --> 01:18:13.731
Sepp Blatter definitely needs
to step down.

1237
01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:20.863
What really broke the straw
was when he said. "I'm not leaving."

1238
01:18:20.947 --> 01:18:23.491
[newsreader] Blatter has not been indicted
and is favoured to win

1239
01:18:23.574 --> 01:18:25.326
an unprecedented fifth term tomorrow.

1240
01:18:25.410 --> 01:18:29.122
extending his 17-year reign
and his reputation as a survivor.

1241
01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:31.416
In the past.
when there's been controversies.

1242
01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:34.419
when there's been investigations.
many in FIFA have fallen.

1243
01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:36.712
Those that have fallen
conveniently are his enemies.

1244
01:18:36.796 --> 01:18:38.464
It's like a Stalinist purge.

1245
01:18:38.548 --> 01:18:41.843
[newsreader] Coming to Blatter's defence
today. Russian President Vladimir Putin.

1246
01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:43.928
[Putin speaks Russian]

1247
01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:46.013
[newsreader]
Accusing US authorities of meddling

1248
01:18:46.097 --> 01:18:50.101
and trying to wrestle away
Russia's hosting the 2018 World Cup.

1249
01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:52.979
[interpreter] It's just another attempt
to extend their jurisdiction

1250
01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:54.063
to other countries.

1251
01:18:55.815 --> 01:19:00.027
It's apparent from recent news reports
that they'd benefit

1252
01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:01.237
from some new leadership.

1253
01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.282
but obviously those kinds of decisions
will have to be made

1254
01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:06.200
by the members of the organisation.

1255
01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:12.874
I am still the president until Friday.
let's say six o'clock in the afternoon.

1256
01:19:12.957 --> 01:19:18.796
[Goldblatt] Blatter's performance in the
face of this is absolutely extraordinary.

1257
01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.216
He is able to get up
in front of the congress and say.

1258
01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:26.971
"I am the man to clean out the stables.
I'm the man to vote for."

1259
01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:32.935
I will be in command
of this boat called FIFA.

1260
01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:35.354
and we will bring it back.

1261
01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:38.357
We will bring it back offshore.

1262
01:19:39.192 --> 01:19:44.363
[Andersen]
You would think that the revelation.

1263
01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:50.244
the biggest systemic corruption scandal
ever in international sport.

1264
01:19:50.328 --> 01:19:52.079
would put an end to Sepp Blatter.

1265
01:19:53.748 --> 01:19:55.625
But. no. not at all.

1266
01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:58.711
Let's go. FIFA. Let's go. FIFA. Thank you.

1267
01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:01.881
Sepp Blatter has won a fifth term
as president.

1268
01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:06.552
Come on! Under FIFA system.
leadership never changes.

1269
01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:08.763
Their elections are such a joke.

1270
01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:14.018
[Goldblatt] There are lots of people that
Blatter had done a lot of favours for.

1271
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:19.815
and that was repaid many times over
at the 2015 congress.

1272
01:20:19.899 --> 01:20:23.361
The majority of this congress
don't want a change.

1273
01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:28.449
so that says a lot about the people
who voted this way.

1274
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:32.703
[man] Are you concerned at some stage
you might be arrested?

1275
01:20:32.787 --> 01:20:35.289
Arrested for what?

1276
01:20:36.249 --> 01:20:37.875
Next question.

1277
01:20:39.252 --> 01:20:42.129
[Goldblatt] I am sure over that weekend

1278
01:20:42.213 --> 01:20:47.343
that Blatter mentally went through
the filing cabinet in his head.

1279
01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:51.764
If the FBI and the American legal system
are this deep.

1280
01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:54.183
what are the documents they're gonna see?

1281
01:20:54.267 --> 01:20:55.810
Where is my name on it.

1282
01:20:55.893 --> 01:20:59.438
and if my name's not on it.
can it be traced back to me?

1283
01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:01.732
[woman] Blatter. Blatter. have some shame!

1284
01:21:01.816 --> 01:21:04.360
[protestors]
Blatter. Blatter. have some shame.

1285
01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:06.237
Sepp Blatter. step down!

1286
01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.864
[woman] Sepp Blatter. step down!

1287
01:21:08.948 --> 01:21:14.996
I am doing my job. and I will do it
until the last day of my mandate.

1288
01:21:15.079 --> 01:21:16.914
[reporter] He's in denial. isn't he?

1289
01:21:16.998 --> 01:21:19.584
He can't accept that the whole world
don't want him there.

1290
01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:24.088
Frankly what we've seen is the ugly side
of the beautiful game. and he should go.

1291
01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:27.216
All the arrests in the world
are gonna change nothing

1292
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.093
as long as Blatter is still there.

1293
01:21:29.176 --> 01:21:34.390
We have a situation where Sepp Blatter.
is a bit like Monty Python's Black Knight.

1294
01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:38.519
There's blood spurting everywhere
and he just thinks it's a flesh wound.

1295
01:21:38.603 --> 01:21:40.479
[protestor] Fuck off. Blatter!

1296
01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:44.525
I cannot monitor everyone all of the time.

1297
01:21:44.609 --> 01:21:47.069
He believes he is FIFA. still.

1298
01:21:47.153 --> 01:21:50.239
He can't believe
that his creature has turned upon him.

1299
01:21:50.323 --> 01:21:54.035
It's like Dr Frankenstein
being beaten to death by his own monster.

1300
01:21:55.369 --> 01:22:00.875
[Blatter] I'm now 40 years in FIFA.
17 years the president of FIFA.

1301
01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:03.878
This is my manifesto.

1302
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:07.673
- [Black Knight] I'm invincible!
- Right!

1303
01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:19.101
[newsreader] The shock announcement came
just days after Blatter was re-elected

1304
01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:20.269
as FIFA president.

1305
01:22:20.353 --> 01:22:26.025
The man who ruled FIFA with an iron grip
for 17 years. Sepp Blatter. has resigned.

1306
01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:30.571
[in French] This is why I will call
an extraordinary congress

1307
01:22:30.655 --> 01:22:34.533
and dispose of my function.

1308
01:22:38.829 --> 01:22:40.247
[Goldblatt] It was extraordinary.

1309
01:22:40.331 --> 01:22:44.293
On the Monday morning. in one of
the most low-key press conferences.

1310
01:22:44.377 --> 01:22:46.671
he said. "I'm gonna resign."

1311
01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:55.888
It's not very hard to clean up football.
It's very easy. actually.

1312
01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:59.266
You just sack 'em all. You're gone. Bye!

1313
01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:01.227
This is just the beginning.

1314
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:03.688
Have you got it. boys?
It's just the beginning!

1315
01:23:03.771 --> 01:23:07.108
[echoes] Beginning. beginning.
beginning. beginning…

1316
01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:12.113
[man] With the announcement that
FIFA President Blatter plans to step down.

1317
01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:14.532
now is the time
for the United States to engage

1318
01:23:14.615 --> 01:23:18.202
and determine how we can encourage
meaningful reforms.

1319
01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:20.913
You're our witness
from outside the United States.

1320
01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:26.794
What influence do you think that
America has in regard to reforming FIFA?

1321
01:23:26.877 --> 01:23:29.630
What America can do is engage

1322
01:23:29.714 --> 01:23:32.967
with clean. decent football associations
around the world.

1323
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:36.303
create a new organisation
based in another land

1324
01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:39.181
and invite sponsors and TV networks
to go with them.

1325
01:23:39.265 --> 01:23:43.519
Mr Jennings. would you agree
that American corporate sponsors

1326
01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:50.568
like Nike. McDonald's. Visa and Coca-Cola
have been enablers?

1327
01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:52.987
Oh. yes. the sponsors have said.

1328
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:56.115
"Oh. well. we only support the World Cup.
We don't support FIFA."

1329
01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:58.159
Well. isn't that tough and brave of them?

1330
01:23:58.242 --> 01:24:01.203
It only took the FBI and the IRS
a few weeks

1331
01:24:01.287 --> 01:24:03.372
to check out the information
that I gave them.

1332
01:24:03.456 --> 01:24:05.124
They arrested Chuck Blazer.

1333
01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:09.670
he immediately turned informant.
and FIFA has imploded.

1334
01:24:09.754 --> 01:24:12.548
You know. once upon a time.
FIFA officials walked down the street

1335
01:24:12.631 --> 01:24:17.178
with the FIFA blazer. the logo.
"I'm from FIFA. I'm important."

1336
01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:21.098
Who would do that now?
Who would dare do that now?

1337
01:24:21.182 --> 01:24:22.183
None of them.

1338
01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:26.645
- [man] This hearing is now adjourned.
- Where can we all sit and make jokes?

1339
01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:29.398
- For the serious stuff.
- Let's do that in the back.

1340
01:24:29.482 --> 01:24:33.986
- And. uh. I'd love a glass of water.
- Yeah. absolutely. of course.

1341
01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:36.071
[hums]

1342
01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:40.367
[Oliver] As I understand it.
they were getting up to go in the morning.

1343
01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:41.952
start filming.

1344
01:24:42.036 --> 01:24:44.663
I get a call from my colleague.
Andrew's in hospital.

1345
01:24:44.747 --> 01:24:46.040
And I said. "What's happened?"

1346
01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:50.836
And he said. "Well. we got up
this morning. I was waiting in the lobby.

1347
01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.923
Andrew walked in
and he collapsed in the hotel lobby."

1348
01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:08.729
We were still making the film.

1349
01:25:10.356 --> 01:25:14.902
And when he was well enough.
we got him flown back to the UK.

1350
01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:24.745
Then it became a question of
what are we gonna do with the film?

1351
01:25:25.788 --> 01:25:28.165
As soon as I could speak to him.
it was clear he wanted…

1352
01:25:28.249 --> 01:25:30.626
"Yes. I want the film done.
I want it finished."

1353
01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:38.133
[Jennings] Sepp Blatter declined
to respond to our questions.

1354
01:25:38.217 --> 01:25:41.345
as did most of his officials.

1355
01:25:41.428 --> 01:25:46.600
Jack Warner told us
he rejected all our allegations

1356
01:25:46.684 --> 01:25:49.478
and is fighting extradition to the US.

1357
01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:55.025
But Jack's already been banned
from the game for life.

1358
01:25:55.693 --> 01:25:59.572
[Oliver] As with most stroke victims.
it affected his ability to talk.

1359
01:25:59.655 --> 01:26:02.783
Unfortunately one letter
he had a real problem with was F.

1360
01:26:02.867 --> 01:26:06.370
which apparently led
to a lot of other words beginning with F.

1361
01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:10.916
But he did it. which was an amazing
tribute to his dedication to his job.

1362
01:26:12.418 --> 01:26:14.503
What's been driving you all these years.

1363
01:26:14.587 --> 01:26:18.090
despite the number of…
of encounters you've had

1364
01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:20.134
and been ignored or told to go away?

1365
01:26:20.217 --> 01:26:22.303
What's kept you going?

1366
01:26:22.386 --> 01:26:24.179
It's a good story.

1367
01:26:24.263 --> 01:26:27.641
I shall be very interested
to see in February.

1368
01:26:27.725 --> 01:26:30.519
when apparently they claim

1369
01:26:30.603 --> 01:26:33.647
they're going to hold an election
for the next president.

1370
01:26:33.731 --> 01:26:35.441
who is turning up.

1371
01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:37.526
[interviewer]
You see this as a cathartic moment?

1372
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:40.404
Or is that still yet to come
from your perspective?

1373
01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:42.448
[Jennings] Oh. it's still yet to come.

1374
01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:47.077
Listen. FIFA's got a long way to fall
before it picks up.

1375
01:26:47.161 --> 01:26:50.456
So. no. it's been fun.
We'll get to the end.

1376
01:26:59.757 --> 01:27:01.675
[Mersiades]
I'm a fairly optimistic person.

1377
01:27:01.759 --> 01:27:05.137
so I always like to think
that something can change.

1378
01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:09.934
[announcer] Total number of valid votes
for Gianni Infantino: 115.

1379
01:27:12.019 --> 01:27:15.648
The point I always return to is
when it comes to culture versus process.

1380
01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:17.274
culture wins every time.

1381
01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:21.695
And in the changes we've seen in FIFA
since 2016.

1382
01:27:21.779 --> 01:27:23.280
I don't see the culture changing.

1383
01:27:23.364 --> 01:27:27.409
And we will restore the image of FIFA
and the respect of FIFA.

1384
01:27:27.493 --> 01:27:30.663
and everyone in the world will applaud us
and will applaud all of you.

1385
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:35.000
[Mersiades]
If you look at Andrew Jenning's words.

1386
01:27:35.084 --> 01:27:37.336
that this is a mafia-style organisation.

1387
01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:40.214
you can just take people
out of the positions

1388
01:27:40.297 --> 01:27:44.176
and someone else will drop in
and basically undertake the same role.

1389
01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:49.723
The reforms need to be implemented now.
They need to be implemented from day one.

1390
01:27:49.807 --> 01:27:54.228
In my opinion. what has happened at FIFA
is a creation of a lie machine.

1391
01:27:54.311 --> 01:27:56.981
a creation of a media manipulation scene.

1392
01:27:57.064 --> 01:28:00.734
Very similar to the tobacco industry
strategy in the 1980s.

1393
01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:06.782
We created recently FIFA+. which is
a great streaming platform as well.

1394
01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:09.118
The scary thought here is that FIFA

1395
01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:13.956
will actually be putting out
its own brand of fake news

1396
01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:16.375
and not try to get reforms done.

1397
01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:21.130
[Goldblatt] FIFA had the movie made.
"United Passions". about its own history.

1398
01:28:21.213 --> 01:28:24.091
- All right. Sophie?
- Morning. Mr Blatter.

1399
01:28:24.174 --> 01:28:28.137
- We are asking you to resign.
- I refuse.

1400
01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:34.059
This was commissioned by Sepp Blatter
about Sepp Blatter. United Passions.

1401
01:28:34.143 --> 01:28:36.854
[Hill] That media manufacturer.

1402
01:28:36.937 --> 01:28:40.482
that campaign
where you're creating quote machines.

1403
01:28:40.566 --> 01:28:45.446
you're creating sources and institutions
that can divert the attention.

1404
01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:51.160
the denial machine was built in that way.

1405
01:28:51.243 --> 01:28:54.371
[Infantino] When it comes to the situation
in Qatar in particular.

1406
01:28:54.455 --> 01:28:55.998
I think we need to be fair there as well

1407
01:28:56.081 --> 01:29:01.879
and admit that a lot of progress
has happened.

1408
01:29:04.089 --> 01:29:06.633
[Szymanski] It's really. really hard
to separate out in many cases

1409
01:29:06.717 --> 01:29:07.926
what's true from what's false.

1410
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:11.263
It's really very easy
to be seeing things online.

1411
01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:13.515
share them without checking
that they are true.

1412
01:29:13.599 --> 01:29:16.769
and then. you know. you may have ended up
sharing something false.

1413
01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:20.481
But there are also outfits
that are working very hard

1414
01:29:20.564 --> 01:29:24.234
to separate out the false information
from what is true.

1415
01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.570
The ability of FIFA

1416
01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:31.075
to turn its back on political issues
may be changing

1417
01:29:31.158 --> 01:29:36.747
in the light of changes in technology
and the emergence of social media.

1418
01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:41.543
So it seems to me that smartphones
in many ways

1419
01:29:41.627 --> 01:29:45.589
opened up the political
Pandora's box. as it were.

1420
01:29:45.672 --> 01:29:50.719
and I think it's going to prove very hard
for them to close that in the future.

1421
01:29:50.803 --> 01:29:54.515
It's hard to hide wrongness now. isn't it?

1422
01:29:54.598 --> 01:29:59.853
It's really difficult. because people
will find you and people will expose you.

1423
01:30:05.067 --> 01:30:09.238
Some are referring to the conflict
in Ukraine as the first TikTok war.

1424
01:30:09.321 --> 01:30:11.865
[Szymanski]
With Ukraine. because of social media.

1425
01:30:11.949 --> 01:30:14.243
we saw immediately
what the Russians were doing.

1426
01:30:14.326 --> 01:30:17.663
Their lies were immediately exposed
for what they were

1427
01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:19.998
and the rest of the world was outraged.

1428
01:30:20.958 --> 01:30:25.379
As in all wars on all continents.
innocent people are being killed

1429
01:30:25.462 --> 01:30:27.506
in meaningless fights for power.

1430
01:30:28.465 --> 01:30:34.138
Initially. FIFA hesitated.
International pressure forced real action.

1431
01:30:34.221 --> 01:30:37.141
FIFA and UEFA have suspended
all Russian teams

1432
01:30:37.224 --> 01:30:41.061
from global competitions
until further notice.

1433
01:30:41.145 --> 01:30:44.648
[woman] I fear our stadiums
will be empty in the future

1434
01:30:44.731 --> 01:30:49.319
if we overlook the urgency
of the current moment.

1435
01:30:49.403 --> 01:30:52.447
[Goldblatt] This notion
of sport and politics not mixing

1436
01:30:52.531 --> 01:30:56.201
has just worn precariously thin.

1437
01:30:57.744 --> 01:30:59.997
[Jennings]
All you can do in these circumstances

1438
01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.916
is stand up for what you think is right.

1439
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.210
But you have to do it.
Democracy is of the people.

1440
01:31:05.294 --> 01:31:07.588
[reporter] They say if you wanna help.
don't just send food.

1441
01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:08.964
because they have a lot of things.

1442
01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:12.926
This is one of our friends we've been
playing soccer with all morning.

1443
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:17.806
[Wright Thompson] Soccer. the game.
is the most democratic thing in the world.

1444
01:31:18.974 --> 01:31:22.477
And FIFA more and more

1445
01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:27.191
seems to only appeal
to countries run by autocrats.

1446
01:31:29.693 --> 01:31:31.778
[Szymanski]
The way FIFA is run is in some ways

1447
01:31:31.862 --> 01:31:34.531
a reflection of the way we run our planet.

1448
01:31:34.615 --> 01:31:40.162
If we could do that well. if we could do
it in a way that would set a good example.

1449
01:31:40.245 --> 01:31:44.666
that might actually give people more
optimism more than any other world leader.

1450
01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:48.045
[Wright Thompson] Andrew did this
for 20 years with these people.

1451
01:31:48.128 --> 01:31:53.967
The fact that this fight goes on
without him is beautiful

1452
01:31:54.051 --> 01:31:56.553
and a giant "fuck you" to people in power

1453
01:31:56.637 --> 01:32:00.015
who think
that they don't answer to anyone.

1454
01:32:00.098 --> 01:32:05.687
because there's always an Andrew Jennings
out there stacking up paper

1455
01:32:05.771 --> 01:32:08.982
that one day will be your epitaph.

1456
01:32:11.485 --> 01:32:14.488
[upbeat music]

1457
01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:23.538
