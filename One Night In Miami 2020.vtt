The excitement has really grown

among this 40.000-strong
Wembley crowd.

8
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:50.468
Safe to say that
every single one of them

9
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.094

MALE ANNOUNCER 2: And Cooper’s
eye is opening wider.

12
00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:57.558
It’s a shocking cut
above his left eye.

13
00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:00.478
He knows he’s got to get this
fight over with fairly quickly.

Clay doesn’t like it.

15

He pushes the referee. but the
referee’s having none of it.

can you at least
finish him off?

00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:36.055
I don’t want to get
too close to him.

34
00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:37.807
I get any more of his blood
on my trunks.

35
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.433
my mama ain’t never
gonna be able to get it out.

36
00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:42.186
Nobody gives a damn about
blood on some boxing trunks.

37
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:43.687
These is my lucky trunks.

Cassius Clay.

47

They’ve been saying
the Louisville Lip’s theatrics

48
00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:02.081
overshadow his actual skills
in the ring.

49
00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:03.916
I doubt Cooper agrees
with that assessment tonight.

50
00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:05.376
Let’s just hope
Clay can put this bloke

51
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:06.544

You could set your watch
by him.

Then suddenly one morning.
after 25 years

101
00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:35.633
of punctual 9:00-in-the-morning
appearances.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.218
not only is he late but
he doesn’t look like himself.

103
00:03:38.302 --> 00:03:41.639
Big lump on his head.
two black eyes. bloody nose.

torn lip. clothes ripped
and disheveled.

105

the world happened to you?"

106
00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:50.689
He says. "Oh. fell down
a whole flight of stairs.

almost got killed."

108
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:55.277

Cliff’s not dressed.

115
00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:08.165
You don’t even have
a chair for him.

-If your guy’s a real singer...
-Real singer?

117
00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.170
...then he don’t need no guitar
player on the floor with him.

118
00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.214
My guy’s first single
was number one in America.

119
00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:16.882
He ain’t had any hits in here.

120
00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.300

We could’ve had Mark Wilson
in this slot.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.513
Who? The magician?

123
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.431

Uh. I-I want
to tell you that. uh.

150
00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:34.126
ever since I started singing.

151
00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.879

I wanted to be a singer.

180
00:07:06.927 --> 00:07:09.805

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.702
-He ain’t wrong. though.
-(laughing)

189
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:34.204
You did kind of stink

190

(chuckles):
Yeah. I did.

191
00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.207
Told him not to sing that song.

192
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:40.210
-He got all them hits;
he chose that one. -I know.

00:08:46.902 --> 00:08:49.071
(bell jingles)

212
00:08:55.369 --> 00:08:57.329
Yes? May I help you?

213
00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:58.455
Yes. ma’am.

214
00:08:58.538 --> 00:08:59.706
I’m here to see Mr. Carlton.

215
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.458
Would you tell him
that Jim Brown is...

216
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.627
Jim Brown? Oh.

217
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.379
God! From the NFL!

218
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:06.505
(both chuckle)

219
00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:08.173
Grandpa!

220
00:09:08.257 --> 00:09:12.678
Jim Brown from the NFL is here.
and he wants to see you.

221
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.472
(laughing):
Well. I never.

222
00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:17.557
(chuckles)

223
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.060
Never.

224
00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:23.355
Would you look
at who’s on my porch.

225
00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:26.066
(chuckles):
James Nathaniel Brown.

226
00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:27.776
Hello there. Mr. Carlton.

227
00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:28.902
Don’t you "hello" me.

228
00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:30.737
Put her there. son.

229
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:31.863
(chuckles)

230
00:09:31.947 --> 00:09:34.324
Come now. have a seat with me.

231
00:09:34.408 --> 00:09:36.410
Can I get you
something to drink?

232
00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:37.703
Lemonade. maybe?

233
00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.329
Oh. that’s all right.
Thank you. though.

234
00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:41.164
Well. suit yourself.

235
00:09:41.248 --> 00:09:43.750
I’m certainly having me some.

236
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:45.711
Fetch us a couple glasses
of that lemonade.

237
00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:47.462
-would you. sweetie?
-(in distance): Yes. Grandpa.

238
00:09:47.546 --> 00:09:49.172
Just in case
you change your mind.

239
00:09:49.256 --> 00:09:50.340
-Hmm.
-(chuckles)

240
00:09:50.424 --> 00:09:52.384
How long you been
back on the island?

241
00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.303
Oh. I just got in last night.

242
00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:57.097
And you came by to say hello?

243
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.932
How thoughtful of you. Jimmy.

244
00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:01.560
Well. my aunt says
you were anxious to see me.

245
00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:04.229
I’m an early riser. so I
thought I’d come right on over.

246
00:10:04.313 --> 00:10:06.064
Mm. the early bird
does catch the worm.

247
00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:08.400
-Mm.
-But you already know that.

248
00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:10.777
You caught a hell of
a lot of worms this year.

249
00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:11.945
(both chuckle)

250
00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:13.780
I guess you can say that.

251
00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:18.869
No man who’s run
1.860 yards in a season

252
00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:20.829
needs to be so humble.

253
00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:24.624
Actually. it was 1.863.

254
00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.460
-Oh. that’s more like it.
-Mm-hmm.

255
00:10:26.543 --> 00:10:29.421
That record is gonna stand
the test of time.

256
00:10:29.504 --> 00:10:31.298
You know. I’d happily
give that record back

257
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.467
for a win over the Packers
in that last game.

258
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.219
(chuckles) That Packers win
is gonna be forgotten

259
00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:39.056
by anyone who doesn’t live
in Goose Bay by tomorrow.

260
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.390
Hmm.

261
00:10:40.474 --> 00:10:43.352
Your record is gonna be
remembered forever.

262
00:10:43.435 --> 00:10:45.103
I don’t see why
I can’t have the record

263
00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:46.813
and the win next time.

264
00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:49.107
Right you are. son.
Right you are.

265
00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:54.780
Jimmy. I-I just wanted
to-to let you know.

266
00:10:54.863 --> 00:10:57.407
if there’s ever anything
I can do for you.

267
00:10:57.491 --> 00:11:00.327
you should never hesitate
to reach out.

268
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:05.040
Um. that’s...

269
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:08.085
That’s-that’s mighty kind
of you. sir.

270
00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:10.670
Oh. our families go way back.

271
00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.005
Been looking after one another

272
00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:14.633
since the first folks
settled on this island.

273
00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:18.678
I wanted to make sure
that I told you face-to-face.

274
00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:23.350
as long as I’m still here.
that ain’t ever gonna change.

275
00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:26.311
Well. my aunt would be
very happy to hear

276
00:11:26.395 --> 00:11:29.564
such a kind sentiment
from you. Mr. Carlton.

277
00:11:29.648 --> 00:11:32.526
Not everyone else on the island
has been so supportive.

278
00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:34.361
Ah. crabs in a barrel. I say.

279
00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:36.405
-To hell with them all.
-(chuckles)

280
00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:40.075
I. for one. think
that you are a credit

281
00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:44.204
not only to this community but
to the entire state of Georgia.

282
00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.789
I’ve never been prouder to say

283
00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:47.791
that I live on
St. Simons Island

284
00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.918
-than I am now.
-Mm.

285
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.755
And I would make
a point of adding

286
00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:56.716
"the place where
the great Jim Brown is from."

287
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.760
(chuckles)

288
00:11:58.844 --> 00:11:59.928
Huh?

289
00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:04.307
-Here you boys go.
-Ah.

290
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:05.642
Two lemonades.

291
00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.102
Thank you. darling.

292
00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:10.147
-Well. thank you.
-Mm.

293
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.691
Uh. sorry to bother you while
you’re entertaining. Grandpa.

294
00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:15.193
but if you could
come move that bureau.

295
00:12:15.277 --> 00:12:16.695
when-when you have a moment.

296
00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:18.864
Oh. Sorry.

297
00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:20.365
I almost forgot.
(chuckles)

298
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:23.910
You. uh... you moving
some furniture?

299
00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:25.412
Mm-hmm.

300
00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:29.416
Well. you know. uh. you should
let me help you with that.

301
00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.084
Ah. so considerate
of you. Jimmy.

302
00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:33.587
but you know we don’t allow
niggers in the house.

303
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.964
so it’s quite all right.

304
00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:39.843
It really is wonderful
to see you. son.

305
00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.012
You keep up the good work.

306
00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:45.223
Do us all proud.

307
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.269
MIKE WALLACE:
While city officials.

308
00:12:49.352 --> 00:12:51.897
state agencies. white liberals

309
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.775
and sober-minded Negroes
stand idly by.

310
00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.235
a group of Negro dissenters is

311
00:12:57.319 --> 00:12:59.654
taking to street corner
step ladders. church pulpits.

312
00:12:59.738 --> 00:13:01.448
sports arenas
and ballroom platforms

313
00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:05.744
across the United States
to preach a gospel of hate

314
00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:07.954
that would set off
a federal investigation

315
00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.332
if it were preached
by Southern whites.

316
00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:12.459
For some time between
now and 1970.

317
00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.086
Elijah Muhammad.
founder and spiritual leader

318
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.296
-of the group.
-(chuckles softly)

319
00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:17.964
has intimated
that he will give the call

320
00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:20.133
for the destruction
of the white man.

321
00:13:20.217 --> 00:13:21.843
Here you will hear
Elijah Muhammad

322
00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:23.720
introduced by
minister Malcolm X.

323
00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.263
the Muslims’ New York leader

324
00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:27.224
and ambassador-at-large
for the movement.

325
00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:30.477
Now. in the church.
we-we used to sing the song

326
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.562
"Good News.
the Chariot Is Coming."

327
00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:34.981
-Is-is that right or wrong?
-CROWD: That’s right.

328
00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:39.653
But what we must bear in mind
is that what’s good news to you

329
00:13:39.736 --> 00:13:42.030
might be bad news to another.

330
00:13:42.113 --> 00:13:44.491
And while you sit here today

331
00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:47.744
knowing that you have come
to hear good news.

332
00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:50.413
you must realize in advance.

333
00:13:50.497 --> 00:13:53.166
what’s good news for the sheep.

334
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.585
well. that might be
bad news for the wolf.

335
00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:57.379
(crowd murmuring. applauding)

336
00:13:57.462 --> 00:13:59.214
(door opens)

337
00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:03.218
I expected you back hours ago.

338
00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:06.012
I know. I know. I know. I know.

339
00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:08.932
I got back as fast as I could.

340
00:14:09.015 --> 00:14:11.768
-Thank goodness you’re safe.
-(sighs)

341
00:14:11.851 --> 00:14:13.603
...and the wisest
and most fearless

342
00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.480
Black man in America...

343
00:14:15.564 --> 00:14:17.065
Where are the girls?

344
00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.608
I put them to bed.

345
00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:22.404
Oh. I promised I’d be here
in time to tuck them in.

346
00:14:26.157 --> 00:14:27.492
(clicks tongue)

347
00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:29.828
I’m really sorry.

348
00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:32.372
But you can put them to bed
tomorrow night.

349
00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.082
-Right.
-(chuckles softly)

350
00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:36.042
Tomorrow.

351
00:14:38.545 --> 00:14:40.714
Did you speak to him?

352
00:14:42.299 --> 00:14:43.633
(smacks lips)

353
00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.385
Yes.

354
00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:47.762
And?

355
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:53.518
Louis X said that if I decide
to leave the Nation of Islam.

356
00:14:53.602 --> 00:14:55.395
I will be doing so on my own.

357
00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:57.772
-Damn him!
-Betty.

358
00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:00.275
Please.

359
00:15:00.358 --> 00:15:03.820
Please just...
don’t wake up the girls.

360
00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.448
He wouldn’t even be
in the Nation if not for you.

361
00:15:06.531 --> 00:15:08.199
let alone running
the Boston temple.

362
00:15:08.283 --> 00:15:11.578
And he remains thankful
for my mentorship.

363
00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:16.291
You told him about
the Messenger’s indiscretions?

364
00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:19.836
All of the secretaries.
all of the children?

365
00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.671
And that didn’t
sway him at all?

366
00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:22.797
No. the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad...

367
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:23.882
Oh. don’t say "Honorable."

368
00:15:23.965 --> 00:15:25.342
...was his lure to the Nation.

369
00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:29.095
just like he was for me
and so many others.

370
00:15:30.096 --> 00:15:31.723
Now imagine convincing someone

371
00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.851
to convert to Christianity and
then telling that same person

372
00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:36.144
to leave the church because

373
00:15:36.227 --> 00:15:37.979
Christ was not
who you said he was.

374
00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:40.231
Louis could stroll right over
to any of the seedy apartments

375
00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:43.360
Elijah Muhammad has those
poor young girls holed up in

376
00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:46.196
and see the proof of his deeds
with his own eyes.

377
00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:50.033
Perhaps Louis X just isn’t
ready to see that truth.

378
00:15:50.116 --> 00:15:52.327
Maybe none of them are.

379
00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:04.255
What are we gonna do now?

380
00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:06.091
The Nation owns this house.

381
00:16:06.174 --> 00:16:07.717
The car.

382
00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:09.511
Everything we have.

383
00:16:09.594 --> 00:16:11.596
The second they learn
about your plan...

384
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.766
I am hoping our friendship
will keep Brother Louis

385
00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:17.018
from sharing our plans
with anyone else.

386
00:16:17.102 --> 00:16:18.311
You can’t count on that.

387
00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.355
I have to.

388
00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:24.317
I have to until I can
make other arrangements.

389
00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:30.407
What else can be done?

390
00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:35.954
You-- We are all alone
if we go through with this.

391
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.208
For the moment.

392
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:44.879
But I have one more
potential ace up my sleeve.

393
00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:47.882
What?

394
00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:50.051
♪ ♪

395
00:16:56.474 --> 00:16:57.809
(splash)

396
00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.323
He can’t even swim.

397
00:17:12.407 --> 00:17:14.951
That boy gonna mess around
and drown.

398
00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:19.205
You need to get on out of there
’fore you get yourself killed.

399
00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:21.458
He’s right. kid. You need to
get your head into this fight.

400
00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:23.918
My head is
into the fight. Angie.

401
00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.754
You sat in on any more
of Liston’s training sessions

402
00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:27.338
-like I asked?
-(grunts)

403
00:17:27.422 --> 00:17:28.506
No need.

404
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.133
No need. no need.

405
00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:33.136
Watching Sonny Liston train
is like... being at the circus.

406
00:17:33.219 --> 00:17:35.513
He looks like one of them
big ugly bears they have

407
00:17:35.597 --> 00:17:37.098
riding around
on tiny little bikes.

408
00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:38.975
All he needs is that
itty-bitty hat on his head.

409
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.727
He ain’t no boxer.
He’s an animal.

410
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.980
He’s an animal that can tear
you apart if you don’t focus.

411
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:45.106
-Mm-hmm.
-You make the same mistakes

412
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.566
with him
as you did with Cooper.

413
00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:48.026
you won’t be walking away
from it.

414
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.778
I won that Cooper fight.
didn’t I?

415
00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:50.862
You got saved by the bell.

416
00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:52.447
And he would’ve finished
the job

417
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.823
if they didn’t stop the fight
from all the bleeding.

418
00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.325
Oh. woulda. coulda.
shoulda. didn’t.

419
00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.160
A win is a win. Ferdie.

420
00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:58.620
I’ll be back in a bit.

421
00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.205
And where on earth
are you going?

422
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:01.414
To check on Malcolm.

423
00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:02.749
Oh. good grief.

424
00:18:06.002 --> 00:18:08.171
You got something else
on your mind. Angie?

425
00:18:08.254 --> 00:18:10.965
Do I need to remind you how
unhappy the Louisville Group is

426
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:12.300
about him being here?

427
00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:13.593
What they got to be mad about?

428
00:18:13.676 --> 00:18:15.595
I been training hard as hell
for this fight.

429
00:18:15.678 --> 00:18:17.096
Well. they’re the ones paying
for all the training.

430
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.389
They’re paying for all of us.

431
00:18:18.473 --> 00:18:19.724
I’m just letting you know

432
00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.559
they’ve been giving me
a lot of grief.

433
00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:23.102
What business is Malcolm
of theirs?

434
00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:24.938
You don’t understand why
a bunch of white businessmen

435
00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:26.689
might be a little stung
by a guy

436
00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:29.442
who says they’re all
natural born demons?

437
00:18:29.526 --> 00:18:32.278
Mm-hmm. That’d do it.

438
00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:34.197
He said "devils."

439
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.407
Malcolm’s never been anything
but kind to you. Angelo.

440
00:18:36.491 --> 00:18:38.493
I know.
but the investors only know

441
00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.954
what they see on TV.
and that ain’t good.

442
00:18:41.037 --> 00:18:42.163
They pay for my training.

443
00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:43.915
They don’t get to choose
my friends for me.

444
00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:46.000
Well. training’s what they want
their money going towards.

445
00:18:46.084 --> 00:18:49.420
not some white-man-hating
demagogue’s airfare.

446
00:18:49.504 --> 00:18:51.506
What did the investors say
when they gave me my money?

447
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:54.384
That it was yours to do with...

448
00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:57.554
To do with as I please. Angie.

449
00:18:57.637 --> 00:18:59.180
And if it pleases me
to bring my friend down

450
00:18:59.264 --> 00:19:00.849
to give me
the spiritual support I need

451
00:19:00.932 --> 00:19:01.933
to win this fight.

452
00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:03.184
then that’s what I’m gonna do.

453
00:19:03.268 --> 00:19:04.519
They want their money back.

454
00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:06.771
I’ll pay it back to all of ’em.
with interest.

455
00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:08.648
after the fight.
Now. if you all will excuse me.

456
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:10.567

You got that right.

Yeah. look who’s talking.

481
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.248
I’m sophisticated.

482
00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:08.791
I don’t know why
I go through all the trouble

483
00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:10.919
of getting
a nice hotel room like this

484
00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:12.921
for a old country gal like you.

485
00:20:13.004 --> 00:20:14.923
I didn’t ask to stay
at the Fontainebleau.

486
00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:16.341
I’d have been perfectly happy

487
00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:17.926
over at the Sir John
with Cassius

488
00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:19.344
or the Hampton House
with Malcolm

489
00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:22.013
and the rest
of the Black folks like us.

490
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.938
But I do like it here.

491
00:20:31.272 --> 00:20:33.316
It’s nice.

492
00:20:38.905 --> 00:20:41.491
And. uh...

493
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:46.663
...I am glad I decided to come
down here for this. Sam.

494
00:20:47.538 --> 00:20:48.873
With you.

495
00:20:53.002 --> 00:20:57.465
You haven’t sung to me
in... a long time.

496
00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:01.344
(clicks tongue)

497
00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:03.471
I know it.

498
00:21:05.139 --> 00:21:07.016

499
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.476
(phone rings)

500
00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:12.105
(phone clicks in cradle)

501
00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.189
Hello.

502
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.315
MALCOLM:
Brother Sam?

503
00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:16.401
Uh. Malcolm!

504
00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:17.777
(Malcolm chuckles softly)

505
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.737
MALCOLM: Is Brother Cassius
there with you?

506
00:21:19.821 --> 00:21:23.366
No. He’s probably doing some
last-minute prep for the fight.

507
00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.201
-Why?
-Oh. uh...

508
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:27.203
I thought he might come by

509
00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.706
before heading
to the convention center

510
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:32.208
so we might have a word or two.

511
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.876
Well. have you tried Jim?

512
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.462
MALCOLM: Yes. Uh.
Jimmy hadn’t seen him. either.

513
00:21:36.546 --> 00:21:39.674
Well. if he calls. I’ll tell
him you’re looking for him.

514
00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:41.592
MALCOLM: Ah. I appreciate that.
Brother Sam.

515
00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:43.928
SAM: We’ll see you
at the convention center.

516
00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:45.805
-Yeah. I wouldn’t miss it.
-All right.

517
00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:54.647
(sighs)

518
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:55.732
(knocking)

519
00:21:55.815 --> 00:21:56.858
Come in.

520
00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:58.735
(music playing in distance)

521
00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:00.278
Yes. Brother Kareem.

522
00:22:00.361 --> 00:22:02.655
You have a visitor.

(laughing)

525
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:13.624
Brother Cassius.

526
00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:15.293
I thought you might not
be able to make it.

527
00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:17.378
Hey. man. ain’t no way
I’m going into that ring

528
00:22:17.462 --> 00:22:18.880
without my insurance policy.

529
00:22:18.963 --> 00:22:20.882
-All right.

Allahu Akbar.

MALCOLM (whispers):

-You ready for tonight?
-(sniffs)

543
00:24:33.431 --> 00:24:34.765
Man. I’ve been training
three years for this fight.

544
00:24:34.849 --> 00:24:36.684
(chuckles): I’m as ready
as a person can be.

545
00:24:36.767 --> 00:24:38.227
Well. uh...

546
00:24:38.311 --> 00:24:41.314
Well. still. it might not hurt
to just tone down the rhetoric

547
00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:43.316
till after the fight.

548
00:24:44.108 --> 00:24:46.235
Why would I do that?

549
00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:47.904
May be easier for you
to focus. Cash.

550
00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:49.113
you know. if. for once.

551
00:24:49.197 --> 00:24:51.532
the only person
gunning for your head

552
00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:54.994
is the guy in the ring
and not the entire arena.

553
00:24:55.077 --> 00:24:57.246
You watch rassling?

554
00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.499
Wrestling. no. I can’t say
it’s part of my daily viewing.

555
00:25:00.583 --> 00:25:01.876
I figured not.

556
00:25:01.959 --> 00:25:04.295
Well. my favorite rassler
is Gorgeous George.

557
00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:06.005
A good-looking fellow.
I take it.

558
00:25:06.088 --> 00:25:08.549
In the European way. sure.

559
00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:11.344
Head full of blond hair
teased up into a nice do.

560
00:25:11.427 --> 00:25:13.930
-Ooh. the crowds must love him.
-Nah.

561
00:25:14.013 --> 00:25:17.642
He preens and he prances around
like a peacock.

562
00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:19.227
talking all kind of smack.

563
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.895
They boo him.
they scream at him.

564
00:25:20.978 --> 00:25:24.106
and the more they scream.
the more he eggs ’em all on.

565
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.108
Oh. so. so he-he’s the villain?

566
00:25:26.192 --> 00:25:28.069
Well. sort of.

567
00:25:28.152 --> 00:25:29.946
Rassling is complicated.

568
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:31.155
And why would you model
yourself

569
00:25:31.239 --> 00:25:33.115
after a person
everyone hates. Cash?

570
00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:37.620
Because everyone in that arena
pays $100

571
00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:39.914
to see George lose.

572
00:25:39.997 --> 00:25:41.123
-(laughs)
-The way I figure it.

573
00:25:41.207 --> 00:25:42.416
win or lose the fight.

574
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.751
George has already won the war.

575
00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:45.503
Well. maybe you fellas
just like

576
00:25:45.586 --> 00:25:47.380
going around with targets
on your backs.

577
00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:50.007
Oh. we learned from the best.
Brother Minister.

578
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:51.509
Touché.

579
00:25:51.592 --> 00:25:52.760
(Malcolm chuckles)

580
00:25:52.843 --> 00:25:54.929
I got you a ticket
in the second row.

581
00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:56.055
right next to Sam.

582
00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:57.723
-And Jimmy?
-Oh. he’s doing. uh.

583
00:25:57.807 --> 00:25:59.976
commentary r-ringside.
but don’t worry.

584
00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:01.936
I already told all of them.
after the fight.

585
00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:05.564
we’re all coming back here
for the champ’s victory party.

586
00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:08.943
And did you...

587
00:26:09.026 --> 00:26:11.070
you tell ’em anything else?

588
00:26:12.989 --> 00:26:15.199
Oh. I didn’t.
I didn’t get around to it.

589
00:26:15.283 --> 00:26:17.285
I mean. um...
I mean. I plan to.

590
00:26:17.368 --> 00:26:18.911
No. no.
It’s all right. my brother.

591
00:26:18.995 --> 00:26:20.246
It’s. uh...
(inhales)

592
00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:22.873
The journey is different
for each of us.

593
00:26:23.874 --> 00:26:25.293
Thank you. Malcolm.

594
00:26:25.376 --> 00:26:28.170
-All right.
-(sighs)

595
00:26:28.254 --> 00:26:30.381
-I got to get back to my team.
-Mm-hmm.

596
00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:33.968
(grunts)
The fight... is at 10:00.

597
00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:38.431
-Don’t be late.
-I won’t.

598
00:26:38.514 --> 00:26:40.641
Peace be unto you.
young brother.

599
00:26:40.725 --> 00:26:42.810
-(door closes)
-Peace be unto you.

600
00:26:46.522 --> 00:26:47.523
ANGELO:
Stay on top of him.

601

and an inch and a half taller.

603
00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:54.155

to the champ.

604
00:26:54.238 --> 00:26:55.823
Come on. sucka. Come on.

606
00:26:58.075 --> 00:26:59.618
Honestly. I’m really happy
that we’re here.

607
00:26:59.702 --> 00:27:01.829
I think we got
a really good show. Oh.

608
00:27:01.912 --> 00:27:03.247
(chuckles):
Oh. All right.

609
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:05.041
That’s what I’m talking about
right there.

Now. see.
the thing about him. man.

622
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:24.685
he stays on his toes.

623
00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:25.770
Nobody moves like him.

624
00:27:25.853 --> 00:27:27.813
He’s just dancing. He floats.

-Stick him. Cash!
-JIM: Cash looks good.

630

He’s staying warm.
He’s moving well. He’s--

631
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.869
Oh. watch that hook. Cash.
Watch that hook.

All right? Finish him off.
Take that belt home. okay?

Stay on him.
He’s looking bad over there.

You’re ready to quit.

-CASSIUS: I’m a bad man!
-(yelling excitedly)

681
00:29:20.092 --> 00:29:21.969
-I told them! I told them!
-You’re the champ!

682
00:29:23.053 --> 00:29:24.763
You’re the champ.

683

I’m the greatest!
I’m king of the world!

-I’m king of the world!
I’m pretty! -You the champ!

687
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:37.485
That’s Sam Cooke.

That’s Sam Cooke.
He too pretty.

-We shook up the world!

694
00:29:52.791 --> 00:29:54.335
We shook up the world!
They got another excuse.

695
00:29:54.418 --> 00:29:55.753
See you at the Hampton House.
champ.

696
00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:57.463
They got another excuse.
They say he threw his arm out.

697
00:29:57.546 --> 00:29:58.923
That’s Sam Cooke.
Get out my way.

698
00:29:59.006 --> 00:30:01.091
Out my way. out my way.
Get off me.

699
00:30:01.175 --> 00:30:03.219
Malcolm! Malcolm!

700
00:30:03.302 --> 00:30:05.846
Aah! I told ’em! I told ’em!

701
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.724
Eat your words!
Eat your words!

702
00:30:08.807 --> 00:30:10.643
Eat your words! I remember you!

703
00:30:10.726 --> 00:30:11.977
I remember you!
You picked him!

704
00:30:12.061 --> 00:30:13.103
I told you!

705
00:30:13.187 --> 00:30:16.482
I remember you.
and I remember you.

706
00:30:16.565 --> 00:30:18.692
(engine revs)

707
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.490
(chatter in Spanish)

708
00:30:25.658 --> 00:30:27.326
(grunts)

709
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:30.538
(exhales. chuckles)

710
00:30:30.621 --> 00:30:32.873
Is this where the party’s at?

711
00:30:32.957 --> 00:30:34.416
Mr. Cooke.

712
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.501
(car door shuts)

713
00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:37.169
I’m Brother Kareem.

714
00:30:37.253 --> 00:30:38.796
The brother minister
instructed us

715
00:30:38.879 --> 00:30:40.798
to let you in
if you arrived early.

716
00:30:40.881 --> 00:30:42.591
I’m the first one here?

717
00:30:42.675 --> 00:30:44.051
That’s correct.

718
00:30:44.134 --> 00:30:45.803
Me and my fast-ass cars.

719
00:30:45.886 --> 00:30:48.430
(chuckles)
So?

720
00:30:48.514 --> 00:30:50.641
This way. please.

721
00:30:58.148 --> 00:31:00.276
(laughing)

722
00:31:06.824 --> 00:31:08.993

724

(airplane passing overhead)

725
00:31:41.233 --> 00:31:43.527
(quietly):
It’s a damn dump.

726
00:31:47.615 --> 00:31:49.700
-(snaps fingers)
-Hmm.

727
00:31:50.618 --> 00:31:52.119
-(snaps fingers)
-Mm.

00:31:52.202 --> 00:31:54.413

00:32:00.127 --> 00:32:02.254

(indistinct chatter. laughter)

747
00:32:52.638 --> 00:32:54.807
I think he caught a glimpse
of his own reflection

748
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.141
and got scared.

749
00:32:56.225 --> 00:32:58.560

00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:06.735
Yes. sir.

755
00:33:06.819 --> 00:33:07.903
He ran out of gas.

756
00:33:07.986 --> 00:33:09.321
There wasn’t
a station around nowhere.

757
00:33:09.405 --> 00:33:11.240
I’m telling you. man.
this is the start.

758
00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:12.908
This is the start right here.
man.

759
00:33:12.991 --> 00:33:14.493
-Come out for the seventh.
-Just the beginning.

760
00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:16.078
-That’s right.
-Hey.

761
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:17.579
-CASSIUS: Just the beginning.
-JIM: Just the beginning.

762
00:33:17.663 --> 00:33:19.123
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

763
00:33:19.206 --> 00:33:20.708
-Whose night is it?
-Where’s-where’s Sam?

764
00:33:20.791 --> 00:33:22.292
-Come on. man. Show us the way.
-Who’s the champ?

765
00:33:22.376 --> 00:33:23.794
-Who’s the champ?
-Oh. you know who the champ is.

766
00:33:23.877 --> 00:33:25.087
-Who’s the champ?
-You know who the champ is.

767
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:26.171
-Who?
-I thought I was the champ.

768
00:33:26.255 --> 00:33:27.631
(chuckling)

769
00:33:27.715 --> 00:33:29.425
-Whew!
-(chuckles)

770
00:33:29.508 --> 00:33:31.260
-Whew.
-Told ’em. I told ’em.

771
00:33:31.343 --> 00:33:33.470
-You got him in six. Cash.
-I told ’em. El Negro.

772
00:33:33.554 --> 00:33:35.222
Campiano. King Bacadero...

773
00:33:35.305 --> 00:33:36.849
Your friend
has already arrived.

774
00:33:36.932 --> 00:33:38.350
-JIM: What the hell does
that mean? -I’d assumed.

775
00:33:38.434 --> 00:33:41.186
-CASSIUS: King of Miami.
-His car is hard to miss.

776
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.272
-All right.
-Yes.

777
00:33:43.355 --> 00:33:45.399
Well. we let him into your room
as you instructed.

778
00:33:45.482 --> 00:33:47.234
Oh. that’s much appreciated.

779
00:33:47.317 --> 00:33:48.610
Is there anything else
you need?

780
00:33:48.694 --> 00:33:50.821
No. brother.
We’ll be fine from here.

781
00:33:50.904 --> 00:33:53.407
-God is great.
-He really is. isn’t he?

782
00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:54.950
SAM:
Mm-hmm.

783
00:33:55.033 --> 00:33:56.744
The hell took y’all so long?

784
00:33:56.827 --> 00:33:58.829
Ah. well. we didn’t run
every damn red light

785
00:33:58.912 --> 00:34:01.498
between the convention center
and Overtown.

786
00:34:01.582 --> 00:34:02.916
CASSIUS: Man. we told you
to ride with us.

787
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.752
What. and leave my car
at the arena parking lot?

788
00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:07.045
Fuck that. Besides.
I had to drop off Barbara.

789
00:34:07.129 --> 00:34:09.757
-(strums guitar)
-Well. was you sad. Sam?

790
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.258
Sitting in here
all by your lonesome?

791
00:34:11.341 --> 00:34:13.177
I don’t need y’all around
to entertain myself.

792
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.220
CASSIUS: We figured you’d have
rounded up some girls

793
00:34:15.304 --> 00:34:16.889
-before we even got here. boy.
-(strumming guitar)

794
00:34:16.972 --> 00:34:18.515
-Where they at? -SAM: Shit.
ain’t you too tired?

795
00:34:18.599 --> 00:34:19.933
Tired? Boy. I’m energized.

796
00:34:20.017 --> 00:34:22.144
Was before I even threw
the first punch.

797
00:34:22.227 --> 00:34:23.687
SAM:
All right.

798
00:34:23.771 --> 00:34:25.439
Man. can you believe
they had the nerve

799
00:34:25.522 --> 00:34:28.400
to trot Willie Pastrano
into the ring before the fight?

800
00:34:28.484 --> 00:34:30.652
You know. they say he boxes
just like you. Cash.

801
00:34:30.736 --> 00:34:31.862
(laughing):
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

802
00:34:31.945 --> 00:34:33.071
Like me?

803
00:34:33.155 --> 00:34:34.615
-Are you insane?
-Hey.

804
00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:36.909
Willie Pastrano-- that’s
the dancing master. ain’t it?

805
00:34:36.992 --> 00:34:39.745
CASSIUS: Shit. if he’s
the dancing master. I must be

806
00:34:39.828 --> 00:34:41.663
the motherfucking inventor
of dance.

807
00:34:41.747 --> 00:34:43.707
-Just ask Sonny.
-Oh. you goddamn right.

808
00:34:43.791 --> 00:34:46.710
I am 210 and a half pounds
of trouble. boys.

809
00:34:46.794 --> 00:34:48.796
And what they didn’t know
was when they weighed me in.

810
00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:51.006
a half pound of it
wasn’t even me.

811
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:52.090
Oh. what was it. Cash?

812
00:34:52.174 --> 00:34:54.259
It was
a half pound of divine skill

813
00:34:54.343 --> 00:34:57.262
-bestowed upon me from
God up on high! -Hey! -JIM: Oh.

814
00:34:57.346 --> 00:34:58.639
-This motherfucker here.
-All right.

815
00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:00.432
They had Joe Louis
on one side of the ring.

816
00:35:00.516 --> 00:35:02.601
Rocky Marciano in the other.

817
00:35:02.684 --> 00:35:05.062
Halfway through the sixth.
out the corner of my eye.

818
00:35:05.145 --> 00:35:06.355
I saw them looking
at each other

819
00:35:06.438 --> 00:35:07.940
like they was
asking themselves.

820
00:35:08.023 --> 00:35:10.317
"Why couldn’t we do that
when we was young?"

821
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.485
(laughing)

822
00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:13.237
I’m serious.

823
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.823
If tonight don’t prove God
was with me. then nothing does.

824
00:35:15.906 --> 00:35:17.491
Well. he sure as shit
wasn’t with Sonny.

825
00:35:17.574 --> 00:35:18.659
Oh. man.
you know Sonny a damn heathen.

826
00:35:18.742 --> 00:35:20.494
And what do they always say.
Malcolm?

827
00:35:20.577 --> 00:35:21.662
The penalty one pays

828
00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:23.413
for avoiding the path
of righteousness

829
00:35:23.497 --> 00:35:26.333
-is walking whatever other path
they choose alone. -Mm-hmm.

830
00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:27.960
-Yes. that’s right.
-(others murmuring)

831
00:35:28.043 --> 00:35:30.087
Yes. yes.
Cassius Marcellus Clay

832
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.131
is the new heavyweight champion
of the world. boys!

833
00:35:33.215 --> 00:35:35.133
-Yes. he is! Yes. he is!
-CASSIUS: And I don’t even have

834
00:35:35.217 --> 00:35:37.052
-a scratch on my fa...
-(Sam laughs)

835
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.350
Oh. my goodness.

836
00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:45.185
-Cassius.
-What’s wrong. Cash?

837
00:35:45.269 --> 00:35:47.062
What? Cash. what...

838
00:35:48.856 --> 00:35:50.315
Why am I so pretty?

839
00:35:50.399 --> 00:35:52.109
-Ah.
-Ah.

840
00:35:52.192 --> 00:35:53.819
And I’m only 22 years old.

841
00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:56.154
There is no way
I’m supposed to be this great.

842
00:35:56.238 --> 00:35:58.365
Look. Alexander the Great
conquered the whole world

843
00:35:58.448 --> 00:35:59.908
at the age of 30...

844
00:35:59.992 --> 00:36:02.411
-Yeah. -...and I conquered
the world of boxing at 22.

845
00:36:02.494 --> 00:36:04.413
without sustaining
so much as a scratch.

846
00:36:04.496 --> 00:36:06.540
-That’s right. -Ah!
-SAM: There he goes!

847
00:36:06.623 --> 00:36:09.126
-You do the math.
-SAM: All right.

848
00:36:09.209 --> 00:36:11.044
Where and when is
this party going down?

849
00:36:11.128 --> 00:36:13.547
Yeah. that’s a good question.
What’s on the agenda. Malcolm?

850
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.425
Well. I thought this would be
a wonderful chance for us

851
00:36:16.508 --> 00:36:18.802
to reflect on
what’s happened tonight.

852
00:36:18.886 --> 00:36:21.555
Like our young brother said.
there’s no denying

853
00:36:21.638 --> 00:36:23.974
that greater forces
were at work.

854
00:36:27.311 --> 00:36:30.522
You mean...
no one else is coming?

855
00:36:30.606 --> 00:36:33.358
Oh. rest assured. my brother.
you’re not missing anything.

856
00:36:33.442 --> 00:36:35.652
But I...

857
00:36:35.736 --> 00:36:37.654
I wanted some pussy tonight.

858
00:36:37.738 --> 00:36:39.406
Ah. it’ll be all right. Jimmy.
I think you’ll live.

859
00:36:39.489 --> 00:36:41.867
Hey. hey. Malcolm. I...
(chuckles)

860
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.327
I-I did not give up a chance

861
00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.078
to stay and party
at the Fontainebleau

862
00:36:45.162 --> 00:36:46.330
for this shit.

863
00:36:46.413 --> 00:36:47.748
-(water running)
-MALCOLM: The Fontainebleau?

864
00:36:47.831 --> 00:36:49.541
The Fontainebleau Miami Beach?

865
00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:51.126
What. you just walked
right up to the counter

866
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:53.253
-and booked yourself a room.
Brother Sam? -Malcolm. relax.

867
00:36:53.337 --> 00:36:55.631
Allen booked the room.
Allen booked the room.

868
00:36:55.714 --> 00:36:57.591
Allen Klein. The white man.

869
00:36:57.674 --> 00:36:59.176
-SAM: That’s his job.
-MALCOLM: Oh. that’s his job?

870
00:36:59.259 --> 00:37:00.969
To tell the other crackers that
you’re one of the good ones?

871
00:37:01.053 --> 00:37:02.512
-To do what I ask him to do.
-Will you two quit

872
00:37:02.596 --> 00:37:04.097
the philosophical debate
for five seconds?

873
00:37:04.181 --> 00:37:06.183
Ain’t you just heard Jim say
he’s getting blue balls?

874
00:37:09.978 --> 00:37:11.730
All right.

875
00:37:11.813 --> 00:37:14.483
We at least have something
to eat while we reflect?

876
00:37:14.566 --> 00:37:17.319
Yes. as a matter of fact.
we do. Brother Sam.

877
00:37:18.612 --> 00:37:19.947
Just because I’m militant

878
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.199
doesn’t mean I don’t know
how to have a good time.

879
00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:23.825
(Cassius snaps fingers)

880
00:37:25.494 --> 00:37:27.204
-What’d I do?
-MALCOLM: Yeah!

881
00:37:28.246 --> 00:37:29.748
Ice cream.

882
00:37:29.831 --> 00:37:32.167
I don’t suppose you have
any beer in there?

883
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.710
Stupid question.

884
00:37:33.794 --> 00:37:35.921
Chips. then. Maybe chips?

885
00:37:36.004 --> 00:37:38.256
Uh... I’m sure I can send

886
00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.175
one of the brothers out
to get some. Sam.

887
00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:41.593
Well. what flavor is it?

888
00:37:41.677 --> 00:37:43.804
Well. we have vanilla. Jimmy...

889
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.517
...and vanilla.

890
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.061
-Shit.
-How’s that for irony?

891
00:37:51.144 --> 00:37:52.562
Last time I checked.
Brother Sam.

892
00:37:52.646 --> 00:37:54.982
vanilla was
your flavor of choice.

893
00:37:55.065 --> 00:37:57.275
-(laughing): Ooh-hoo-hoo.
-SAM: All right.

894
00:37:57.359 --> 00:37:58.360
That’s right. Jack.

895
00:37:58.443 --> 00:37:59.653
Hey. fellas. I’m just saying.

896
00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:01.613
can’t we at least
go someplace hoppin’?

897
00:38:01.697 --> 00:38:04.658
The entire city of Miami
is celebrating Cassius’s win.

898
00:38:04.741 --> 00:38:05.909
Yeah. they was all expecting

899
00:38:05.993 --> 00:38:07.494
to be partying
with Sonny Liston tonight.

900
00:38:07.577 --> 00:38:10.664
Yeah. and it seem to me
it’s not a great idea.

901
00:38:10.747 --> 00:38:12.332
your first night as world champ.

902
00:38:12.416 --> 00:38:15.043
starting it off by throwing
away all that goodwill.

903
00:38:15.127 --> 00:38:18.088
MALCOLM:
Goodwill? Goodwill from whom?

904
00:38:18.171 --> 00:38:20.215
Goodwill from the press.

905
00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:22.134
who threw their support
behind that thug.

906
00:38:22.217 --> 00:38:24.386
hoping that he’d put
our young brother in his place?

907
00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:26.179
No. you out of your mind. Sam.

908
00:38:26.263 --> 00:38:30.892
And besides. besides.
part of the reason we’re here

909
00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:34.021
is to celebrate
Cassius’s official transition.

910
00:38:34.104 --> 00:38:35.105
Malc!

911
00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:37.691
Transition?

912
00:38:37.774 --> 00:38:38.817
To what?

913
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.861
Shall we give them the news.
Cassius?

914
00:38:40.944 --> 00:38:44.740
Well. I suppose if. uh.
you want to tell them. Malcolm.

915
00:38:44.823 --> 00:38:46.116
SAM:
Now. wait a second.

916
00:38:47.534 --> 00:38:50.120
You ain’t about to say
what I think you gonna say?

917
00:38:50.203 --> 00:38:52.914
I’ve been thinking
long and hard about it. boys.

918
00:38:52.998 --> 00:38:57.544
and I’m officially joining
the Nation of Islam.

919
00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:00.505
(Jim chuckles)

920
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:03.800
Cassius. are you sure
that’s such a good idea?

921
00:39:03.884 --> 00:39:04.926
CASSIUS:
Why not?

922
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.303
Well. I thought
this Muslim jive

923
00:39:06.386 --> 00:39:07.929
was something
to rile up white folks.

924
00:39:08.013 --> 00:39:09.681
-No. it’s no jive. Sam.
-The cameras are off. Malcolm.

925
00:39:09.765 --> 00:39:11.475
He became champion
on his own terms.

926
00:39:11.558 --> 00:39:14.311
-Naysayers be damned.
-SAM: We can’t all just go out

927
00:39:14.394 --> 00:39:15.604
and declare the white man
the devil.

928
00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:17.773
Oh? Why not?

929
00:39:17.856 --> 00:39:19.274
Huh?

930
00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:21.401
We’re entering a new time
where no one can hold us back

931
00:39:21.485 --> 00:39:22.527
from voicing
our honest opinions.

932
00:39:22.611 --> 00:39:24.112
Look at Jimmy.

933
00:39:24.196 --> 00:39:27.199
Jimmy hasn’t bitten his tongue
for one day of his career.

934
00:39:27.282 --> 00:39:29.326
Well. you ain’t lying.

935
00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:31.411
-Oh. so you agree with him?
-Look. man.

936
00:39:31.495 --> 00:39:33.080
I’m always in the hot seat.
all right?

937
00:39:33.163 --> 00:39:35.415
But as long as I keep winning.
ain’t one fucking thing

938
00:39:35.499 --> 00:39:37.417
any racist poot butt
can do about it.

939
00:39:37.501 --> 00:39:38.502
That’s right.

940
00:39:38.585 --> 00:39:40.295
Well. if it’s such a good idea.

941
00:39:40.378 --> 00:39:42.130
why don’t you become
a Muslim. too?

942
00:39:42.214 --> 00:39:45.217
Shit. Have you tasted
my grandmother’s pork chops?

943
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.219
-(laughs)
-And...

944
00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:49.805
I like white women. too.
Fuck that.

945
00:39:49.888 --> 00:39:52.474
Oh. you’ll see the light
soon enough. Jimmy.

946
00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:54.059
I don’t need to.
hanging around you.

947
00:39:54.142 --> 00:39:56.353
Ain’t you ever heard
of guilt by association?

948
00:39:56.436 --> 00:39:59.481
Well. you already do
have plenty of nice suits.

949
00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:01.566
You given any thought
to switching

950
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:02.818
from straight to bow ties?

951
00:40:02.901 --> 00:40:04.319
Malcolm. you ain’t never
gonna catch me

952
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:06.029
dressed up as
one of your soldiers of Allah.

953
00:40:06.113 --> 00:40:07.906
Ah. no.
I-I’ve already seen it. Jimmy.

954
00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:09.616
Th-Those pictures I took of you

955
00:40:09.699 --> 00:40:11.618
-going to practice looking
sharp as a razor. -(Jim laughs)

956
00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:13.161
The spitting image. Cash.

957
00:40:13.245 --> 00:40:16.331
of a-a powerful.
Black Muslim warrior.

958
00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:18.375
-I know it.
-A photo never lies. Jimmy.

959
00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:20.585
Photo never lies.
It-it al...

960
00:40:22.129 --> 00:40:23.130
SAM:
Malcolm?

961
00:40:23.213 --> 00:40:25.006
CASSIUS:
What’s wrong. Malcolm?

962
00:40:26.299 --> 00:40:29.636
Just remembered I left
my new camera in the car.

963
00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:31.555
-Better go get it.
-Now?

964
00:40:31.638 --> 00:40:33.306
Yeah. I just got that camera.

965
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.724
Oh. don’t sweat it. man.

966
00:40:34.808 --> 00:40:36.393
The bodyguards have
this whole place locked down.

967
00:40:36.476 --> 00:40:37.727
They’ll see anybody
messing with your car.

968
00:40:37.811 --> 00:40:39.354
Is everything all right.
Brother Malcolm?

969
00:40:39.437 --> 00:40:41.731
Yes. brother. I just need
to get something from the car.

970
00:40:41.815 --> 00:40:43.692
I’ll accompany you.

971
00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:44.901
Watch the door.

972
00:40:44.985 --> 00:40:46.778
Yes. brother.

973
00:40:49.072 --> 00:40:51.158
Hey. what’s wrong. brother?

974
00:40:51.241 --> 00:40:54.995
Ain’t your shit safe here
in the Black community?

975
00:40:55.078 --> 00:40:56.746
(laughs)

976
00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:59.666
KAREEM: Your friend is
quite the truculent one.

977
00:40:59.749 --> 00:41:01.793
Well. entertaining white people
in the South

978
00:41:01.877 --> 00:41:05.714
will bring the truculence
out of any Black man.

979
00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:07.674
(Cassius grunting. muttering)

980
00:41:07.757 --> 00:41:09.968
♪ ♪

981
00:41:10.051 --> 00:41:12.929
What are you.
a giant fucking baby?

982
00:41:13.013 --> 00:41:15.265
No. man.

983
00:41:15.348 --> 00:41:16.433
I can’t help it.

984
00:41:16.516 --> 00:41:18.059
I’m full of energy.

985
00:41:18.143 --> 00:41:21.563
Well. this party’s
off to a hoppin’ start.

986
00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:22.939
I-I just know we are not
fittin’ to sit here

987
00:41:23.023 --> 00:41:24.482
in this little-ass room
all night.

988
00:41:24.566 --> 00:41:26.401
It’s not like anyone else
is planning a victory party.

989
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:28.862
The diner downstairs
is open all night.

990
00:41:28.945 --> 00:41:30.447
We could throw
this shindig there

991
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.240
if Malcolm would
lighten the hell up.

992
00:41:32.324 --> 00:41:33.325
CASSIUS: He’s just looking out
for me. Sam.

993
00:41:33.408 --> 00:41:34.784
SAM:
He’s a big boy. Cash.

994
00:41:34.868 --> 00:41:36.578
CASSIUS: Still. you ain’t
got to antagonize him.

995
00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:38.246
He should be able to handle
being called out on his shit.

996
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.708
especially since he’s made
such a name for himself

997
00:41:41.791 --> 00:41:43.126
calling everyone else out
on theirs.

998
00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:44.586
CASSIUS: Why you got
to push back so hard

999
00:41:44.669 --> 00:41:45.962
on everything. Sam?

1000
00:41:46.046 --> 00:41:47.422
SAM: ’Cause I’m
a pushy motherfucker.

1001
00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:48.715
-And I ain’t changing.
-CASSIUS: Oh. grow up.

1002
00:41:48.798 --> 00:41:50.675
Mm... you two.

1003
00:41:50.759 --> 00:41:52.344
(silverware clanging)

1004
00:41:52.427 --> 00:41:54.846
You want some ice cream?

1005
00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.806
Everything okay. brother?

1006
00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:58.308
Yes. brother.

1007
00:42:05.065 --> 00:42:07.150
I should make a call
while I’m down here.

1008
00:42:07.234 --> 00:42:09.903
Well. is the phone in your room
not working?

1009
00:42:09.986 --> 00:42:13.490
I prefer privacy
when I speak to my wife.

1010
00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:15.367
I’d rather not
send all the fellas out.

1011
00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:17.035
I’ll be right back.

1012
00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:20.330
You know the thing that’ll
make this a little bit better?

1013
00:42:20.413 --> 00:42:21.414
CASSIUS:
What?

1014
00:42:21.498 --> 00:42:23.583
-Sam’s stash.
-Fuck y’all.

1015
00:42:23.667 --> 00:42:25.794
-Come on. man. Where is it?
-No. No way.

1016
00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:27.921
Hey. check his guitar case.

1017
00:42:28.004 --> 00:42:29.089
For what?

1018
00:42:29.172 --> 00:42:30.966
Just look. fool.

1019
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.637
Ain’t gonna find it.

1020
00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.305
I bet he will find something.

1021
00:42:37.389 --> 00:42:40.225
I bet you that cheap
purple suit we will.

1022
00:42:40.308 --> 00:42:42.143
SAM: Don’t drink
all my shit. neither.

(Cassius exhales)

1024
00:42:48.316 --> 00:42:50.026
Yeah.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.239
(sniffs)

1026
00:42:54.322 --> 00:42:56.116
Attallah?

1027
00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:58.368
ATTALLAH (over phone):
Hi. Daddy.

1028
00:42:58.451 --> 00:43:00.704
Hey. sweetheart.

1029
00:43:00.787 --> 00:43:02.706
What are you doing up so late?

1030
00:43:02.789 --> 00:43:04.541
You woke me up.

1031
00:43:04.624 --> 00:43:07.419
-Oh. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
-(yawns)

1032
00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:10.755
I didn’t mean to wake you up.
uh. but I’m glad you answered

1033
00:43:10.839 --> 00:43:13.174
because I’ve got
something for you.

1034
00:43:13.258 --> 00:43:15.343
You want it now?

1035
00:43:15.427 --> 00:43:16.886
Okay.

1036
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:20.682
All right. well. I need you
to get down from the stool.

1037
00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:25.061
I want you to take
three big jumps forward.

1038
00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.149
Now look to your left.

1039
00:43:29.232 --> 00:43:31.026
Now what’s in front of you?

1040
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:32.110
ATTALLAH:
Books.

1041
00:43:32.193 --> 00:43:33.653
MALCOLM:
Books. that’s right.

1042
00:43:33.737 --> 00:43:36.448
Now I want you to take
one of those books.

1043
00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:38.616
ATTALLAH:
Which one?

1044
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.076
MALCOLM:
It’s your favorite number.

1045
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.914
One. two. three.
four. five. six.

1046
00:43:44.998 --> 00:43:46.333
MALCOLM:
There you go.

1047
00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:48.209
Now open it up.

1048
00:43:48.293 --> 00:43:50.754
Take a look inside.

1049
00:43:53.798 --> 00:43:55.258
You see it?

1050
00:43:55.342 --> 00:43:58.678
-Thank you. Daddy.
-You be a good girl

1051
00:43:58.762 --> 00:44:01.598
-and you read that
to your sisters. okay? -Okay.

1052
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:03.058
BETTY: Attallah.
It’s time to go to bed.

1053
00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:04.601
ATTALLAH:
It’s Daddy.

1054
00:44:04.684 --> 00:44:07.604
I understand. sweetheart.
but it’s time to go to bed.

1055
00:44:07.687 --> 00:44:10.231
ATTALLAH: Can I talk to him
for a few more minutes?

1056
00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:12.150
-Please?
-(chuckles)

1057
00:44:13.234 --> 00:44:14.736
Okay.

1058
00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:16.321
(chuckles)

1059
00:44:16.404 --> 00:44:18.114
Where are you?

1060
00:44:23.453 --> 00:44:25.580
(knock on door)

1061
00:44:26.915 --> 00:44:28.666
CASSIUS:
Who is it?

1062
00:44:29.918 --> 00:44:32.253
Can I get anything for you.
brothers?

1063
00:44:33.505 --> 00:44:35.382
Nah. man.
We’re all good in here.

1064
00:44:35.465 --> 00:44:38.718
JAMAAL:
Oh. good. Good.

1065
00:44:38.802 --> 00:44:40.095
Good.

1066
00:44:42.764 --> 00:44:44.099
Say. champ.
you don’t suppose you could

1067
00:44:44.182 --> 00:44:46.851
see your way to signing
an autograph for me?

1068
00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:50.355
Uh. yeah. of course. man.

1069
00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:52.232
-Yeah. come on in.
-(Jim chuckles)

1070
00:44:52.315 --> 00:44:53.608
Yeah. You got to make sure

1071
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:55.568
your superior officer
don’t catch you?

1072
00:44:55.652 --> 00:44:58.029
Oh. yeah. Brother Kareem
can run a pretty tight ship.

1073
00:44:58.113 --> 00:45:00.573
but he’s committed to teaching
the young brothers discipline.

1074
00:45:00.657 --> 00:45:02.909
Yeah. well. I never been a fan
of no tight ship.

1075
00:45:02.992 --> 00:45:04.702
Oh. quit messing with
the young brother. Jim.

1076
00:45:04.786 --> 00:45:06.538
-Here. give him an autograph.
-JAMAAL: Oh. yeah.

1077
00:45:06.621 --> 00:45:07.705
That-That’d be great.
And. actually. champ.

1078
00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:09.207
I-I’m a couple
of years older than you.

1079
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:10.291
(chuckles): Oh. see.
I’m such an overachiever.

1080
00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:11.668
sometimes I forget.

1081
00:45:11.751 --> 00:45:13.503
-(laughs) -JIM: Yeah.
-Now. you know Jim Brown here

1082
00:45:13.586 --> 00:45:15.797
is the strongest man
in the whole world?

1083
00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.715
Oh. yeah.
See. I’m from Toledo.

1084
00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:20.468
We’ve been watching Mr. Brown’s
games for years now.

1085
00:45:20.552 --> 00:45:21.886
Actually. I almost
got to go to one.

1086
00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:24.514
-Oh. yeah?
-Yeah.

1087
00:45:24.597 --> 00:45:26.391
-Nah. I didn’t have no money.
-(door closes)

1088
00:45:26.474 --> 00:45:27.475
Oh.

1089
00:45:27.559 --> 00:45:28.601
Mr. Cooke.

1090
00:45:28.685 --> 00:45:31.354
-If you wouldn’t mind.
-(laughs softly)

1091
00:45:31.438 --> 00:45:33.690
SAM:
Oh. sure thing. brother.

1092
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:39.279
Hey. man.

1093
00:45:39.362 --> 00:45:40.572
Jamaal.

1094
00:45:40.655 --> 00:45:42.240
Yeah.

1095
00:45:42.323 --> 00:45:43.908
Mind if I ask you a question?

1096
00:45:43.992 --> 00:45:45.493
Yeah. sure.

1097
00:45:46.494 --> 00:45:48.580
You like being a Muslim?

1098
00:45:48.663 --> 00:45:51.791
Well. it... it beats being
a purse thief from Toledo.

1099
00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:52.876
(laughs)

1100
00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:54.586
Yeah. I know that’s right.

1101
00:45:54.669 --> 00:45:56.296
No. I mean. but...

1102
00:45:56.379 --> 00:45:59.007
I mean. was it hard.
you know. giving up stuff?

1103
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.301
JAMAAL:
Well. I reckon so.

1104
00:46:01.384 --> 00:46:04.345
I used to love me a nice
Champale every now and then.

1105
00:46:04.429 --> 00:46:06.306
Certainly miss
my grandmama’s pork chops.

1106
00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:08.224
-See? -JAMAAL:
And it can be difficult.

1107
00:46:08.308 --> 00:46:10.393
-You know. like. the schedule.
-CASSIUS: Yeah.

1108
00:46:10.477 --> 00:46:11.644
I mean. but none of that’s

1109
00:46:11.728 --> 00:46:13.104
gonna apply to you anyway.
so...

1110
00:46:13.188 --> 00:46:14.522
CASSIUS:
What you mean?

1111
00:46:14.606 --> 00:46:16.274
JAMAAL:
I’m just saying. I don’t think

1112
00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:19.027
you’ll be spending much time
handing out pamphlets is all.

1113
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:20.820
(chuckles): Yeah. Yeah.
I suppose you’re right.

1114
00:46:20.904 --> 00:46:22.155
Say. man.

1115
00:46:22.238 --> 00:46:24.449
Do you have any regrets?

1116
00:46:24.532 --> 00:46:26.659
Oh. regrets? I...

1117
00:46:26.743 --> 00:46:28.870
JIM: You know. with hitching
your cart to the Muslim train.

1118
00:46:28.953 --> 00:46:30.747
JAMAAL:
Yeah. Uh...

1119
00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:32.874
Yeah.

1120
00:46:32.957 --> 00:46:35.376
Yes. um...

1121
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.170
I th-- I-I think
you can say I do.

1122
00:46:37.253 --> 00:46:39.255
Really?

1123
00:46:39.339 --> 00:46:42.425
I regret that I didn’t join up
when I was even younger.

1124
00:46:42.509 --> 00:46:43.843
-Ah.
-Oh.

1125
00:46:43.927 --> 00:46:45.929
JAMAAL: This kid named Rollo
used to chase me home

1126
00:46:46.012 --> 00:46:48.056
from school every damn day.

1127
00:46:48.139 --> 00:46:49.766
He’s the reason
I stopped going.

1128
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:51.601
-CASSIUS: Oh. -JAMAAL: Now.
I reckon if I would’ve

1129
00:46:51.684 --> 00:46:52.936
gotten
with the brothers sooner.

1130
00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:54.854
we could’ve nipped it
in the bud

1131
00:46:54.938 --> 00:46:57.982
and put a foot in Rollo’s ass.
You know what I’m saying?

1132
00:46:58.066 --> 00:46:59.984
Yeah. you don’t need religion
for that. kid.

1133
00:47:00.068 --> 00:47:01.528
You could just join a gang.

1134
00:47:01.611 --> 00:47:03.696
What’s the damn difference?

1135
00:47:06.824 --> 00:47:08.701
Anyway. I-I better get going

1136
00:47:08.785 --> 00:47:10.703
before Brother Kareem
gets back.

1137
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:14.207
Hey. we’re all proud
of you. champ.

1138
00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:15.583
Aw.

1139
00:47:17.961 --> 00:47:20.213

You were the only one

It’s only fitting that you and
Cassius be blessed in this way.

1170
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.758
That you do
this thing together.

Can I tell you something?

00:48:58.728 --> 00:49:01.689
Of course. man. anything.

1178
00:49:01.773 --> 00:49:03.274
I did a movie.

1179
00:49:03.358 --> 00:49:04.734
You produced a movie?

1180
00:49:04.817 --> 00:49:07.487
Nah. man. I starred in one.

1181
00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.323
(chuckles)

1182
00:49:10.406 --> 00:49:13.451
Oh. well. that’s great. Jim.
but you’re not an actor.

1183
00:49:13.534 --> 00:49:15.286
That’s what I told the cat
who wanted to cast me.

1184
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.246
but he put me
in his Western anyway.

1185
00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.165
-A Western. huh?
-Yeah.

1186
00:49:19.248 --> 00:49:22.418
Okay. so. uh.
who-who do you play?

1187
00:49:22.502 --> 00:49:24.545
I play a buffalo soldier.

1188
00:49:24.629 --> 00:49:26.047
I’m part of this special unit.

1189
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.299
and. uh. we’re tracking
this Confederate general.

1190
00:49:28.383 --> 00:49:30.343
He’s being protected
by these Apaches.

1191
00:49:30.426 --> 00:49:31.469
Damn.

1192
00:49:31.552 --> 00:49:33.221
-That sounds pretty good.
-Yeah.

1193
00:49:33.304 --> 00:49:35.223
-So you’re the hero?
-One of them.

1194
00:49:35.306 --> 00:49:37.392
But my character gets killed
about halfway through.

1195
00:49:37.475 --> 00:49:39.268
-so when...
-(laughing)

1196
00:49:39.352 --> 00:49:40.561
What?

1197
00:49:40.645 --> 00:49:42.313
No. nothing. man. I just...

1198
00:49:42.397 --> 00:49:45.149
I should’ve known as soon as
you said "Black action hero."

1199
00:49:45.233 --> 00:49:48.820
the next part of that sentence
was gonna be "who gets killed."

1200
00:49:48.903 --> 00:49:50.905
Hmm.

1201
00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:52.573
It went well. man.

1202
00:49:52.657 --> 00:49:55.076
I think there might be
a future for me in this.

1203
00:49:55.159 --> 00:49:57.620
Being the sacrificial Negro
in some Western

1204
00:49:57.704 --> 00:49:59.831
ain’t the same as the NFL. man.

1205
00:49:59.914 --> 00:50:02.959
But how much you getting paid
to be in this movie?

1206
00:50:03.042 --> 00:50:06.504

1376
00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:07.842
JIM: That was definitely
not hep. daddy-o.

1377
00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:09.009
SAM:
Talking about "blew your wig."

1378
00:57:09.093 --> 00:57:11.137
Just show us the camera. Negro.

1379
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:14.807
Fine. just stop joking
for a second.

1380
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:15.975
Okay.

1381
00:57:16.058 --> 00:57:17.184
(laughing)

1382
00:57:17.268 --> 00:57:18.477
Jesus.

1383
00:57:21.147 --> 00:57:22.982
SAM and JIM:
"You blew your wig."

1384
00:57:23.065 --> 00:57:24.233
(Jim laughs)

1385
00:57:24.316 --> 00:57:26.068
-"Blew your wig."
-Oh. he’s taking a picture.

1386
00:57:26.152 --> 00:57:27.611
Oh. uh. hold on. Wait.

1387
00:57:27.695 --> 00:57:30.239
-(chuckling. muttering)
-(clears throat)

1388
00:57:30.322 --> 00:57:33.367
-Looking sharp now. -MALCOLM:
It’s a Rolleiflex 3.5.

1389
00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:36.620
A German twin-lens
reflex camera.

1390
00:57:36.704 --> 00:57:38.581
It’s a fine piece
of engineering. gents.

1391
00:57:38.664 --> 00:57:40.958
You see. it has this.
uh. pop-out viewfinder.

1392
00:57:41.041 --> 00:57:42.126
Well. it looks bulky.

1393
00:57:42.209 --> 00:57:43.502
MALCOLM:
No. Jimmy. it’s a work of art.

1394
00:57:43.586 --> 00:57:44.587
JIM:
Hmm.

1395
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:46.422
(camera clicks)

1396
00:57:47.548 --> 00:57:49.175
Yeah. Besides. uh. you know.

1397
00:57:49.258 --> 00:57:52.052
I’ve always got my Nikon handy
for taking photos on the move.

1398
00:57:52.136 --> 00:57:54.847
Like when you’re running
from the Feds?

1399
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:55.931
-(chuckles)
-Yeah.

1400
00:57:56.015 --> 00:57:57.892
Or. uh. riding on a camel.

1401
00:57:58.934 --> 00:58:01.854
Mm. Where to?

1402
00:58:01.937 --> 00:58:04.148
-Mecca.
-(Jim chuckles softly)

1403
00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:06.567
Ah. you’re going
to Saudi Arabia?

1404
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:07.943
MALCOLM:
Mm-hmm.

1405
00:58:08.027 --> 00:58:09.195
Yes.

1406
00:58:09.278 --> 00:58:10.696
All Muslims are
supposed to do it

1407
00:58:10.779 --> 00:58:12.489
at least once
in their lives. Sam.

1408
00:58:12.573 --> 00:58:15.701
And. well. since I’m not doing
any speaking right now. this...

1409
00:58:15.784 --> 00:58:17.828
this feels like
as good a time as any.

1410
00:58:17.912 --> 00:58:20.789
Oh. maybe I’ll take a few
detours while I’m out there.

1411
00:58:20.873 --> 00:58:22.958
Be quite amazing to see
the Great Pyramids.

1412
00:58:23.042 --> 00:58:25.211
Man. that sounds fantastic.

1413
00:58:25.294 --> 00:58:26.879
Oh. it will be.

1414
00:58:26.962 --> 00:58:29.048
If your schedule permits.
you should join me.

1415
00:58:29.131 --> 00:58:31.425
Hey. count me in.

1416
00:58:31.508 --> 00:58:32.843
-JIM: Yeah?
-Count me in.

1417
00:58:32.927 --> 00:58:35.179
I mean. fine African sisters.

1418
00:58:35.262 --> 00:58:37.389
Come on. Jim.
I know you’re down with that.

1419
00:58:37.473 --> 00:58:39.725
Oh. with the ladies.
most definitely.

1420
00:58:39.808 --> 00:58:40.935
But I’m up for another part.

1421
00:58:41.018 --> 00:58:42.353
So. see. in between that
and camp.

1422
00:58:42.436 --> 00:58:44.104
I won’t have time
for a trip to Africa.

1423
00:58:44.188 --> 00:58:46.732
Hey. you should consider
coming as well. Sam.

1424
00:58:46.815 --> 00:58:48.859
Leaving this country
in the rearview for a while

1425
00:58:48.943 --> 00:58:51.695
is a great way
to get some perspective.

1426
00:58:51.779 --> 00:58:53.656
Nah. I’m busy. too.

1427
00:58:53.739 --> 00:58:56.242
One can never be too busy
for some added perspective.

1428
00:58:56.325 --> 00:58:58.160
SAM:
Nah. I’m swamped. man.

1429
00:58:58.244 --> 00:59:02.289
And I got to prep
to go back to the Copa.

1430
00:59:02.373 --> 00:59:03.707
(laughing):
Oh. come on. man.

1431
00:59:03.791 --> 00:59:06.001
You need to go on
and forget about the Copa.

1432
00:59:06.085 --> 00:59:07.753
It was not that bad.

1433
00:59:07.836 --> 00:59:10.089
CASSIUS:
Come on. man.

1434
00:59:10.172 --> 00:59:12.174
All right. fine.
maybe it was that bad.

1435
00:59:12.258 --> 00:59:13.634
Well. y-you don’t shuck
and jive enough

1436
00:59:13.717 --> 00:59:15.302
for those ofay tastes.

1437
00:59:15.386 --> 00:59:18.264
I may not dance around a stage
like Jackie or James Brown.

1438
00:59:18.347 --> 00:59:20.349
but that’s not what
I’m selling. all right?

1439
00:59:20.432 --> 00:59:24.311
I’m selling my voice.
my words. my image...

1440
00:59:24.395 --> 00:59:25.562
my-my message.

1441
00:59:25.646 --> 00:59:27.398
MALCOLM:
Your message? Hmm.

1442
00:59:27.481 --> 00:59:29.191
The problem is. at the Copa.
you have to sell that message

1443
00:59:29.275 --> 00:59:30.567
to a bunch of white folks.

1444
00:59:30.651 --> 00:59:32.945
That don’t matter.
They got souls. don’t they?

1445
00:59:33.028 --> 00:59:34.280
And every living thing
with a soul

1446
00:59:34.363 --> 00:59:35.864
can have that soul tapped into.

1447
00:59:35.948 --> 00:59:37.241
-I thought you’d know that.
-Do you think.

1448
00:59:37.324 --> 00:59:38.701
just maybe.
your energy’s misdirected. Sam.

1449
00:59:38.784 --> 00:59:39.910
trying to tap into
white people’s souls?

1450
00:59:39.994 --> 00:59:41.745
No. I don’t.

1451
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:43.706
If I win them over.
playing our music.

1452
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:45.708
I’m-I’m knocking down doors
for everybody.

1453
00:59:45.791 --> 00:59:47.001
You watch and see.

1454
00:59:47.084 --> 00:59:49.795
It’s not gonna always be
the pop charts over here.

1455
00:59:49.878 --> 00:59:51.630
Black music charts over there.

1456
00:59:51.714 --> 00:59:53.799
-One day. it’s gonna be
one chart... -Mm.

1457
00:59:53.882 --> 00:59:55.801
...with one music.
for all people.

1458
00:59:55.884 --> 00:59:57.219
What kind of message
are you sending. though.

1459
00:59:57.303 --> 00:59:58.887
by doing one show
for white folks

1460
00:59:58.971 --> 01:00:00.431
and a completely different show
for Black folks. Sam?

1461
01:00:00.514 --> 01:00:02.182
-(scoffs)
-You... N-No. listen to me.

1462
01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:04.018
You’re performing in-in places
where the only Black people

1463
01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.020
not onstage are the ones
serving the food.

1464
01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.771
Don’t you think I know that?

1465
01:00:07.855 --> 01:00:09.940
Can’t tell you how many times
I wanted to reach out

1466
01:00:10.024 --> 01:00:11.442
and punch somebody.
but you c...

1467
01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.235
Then. then. then. then
strike with the weapon

1468
01:00:13.319 --> 01:00:15.404
that you have. man. your voice!

1469
01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.281
Black people--
we-we standing up.

1470
01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:19.700
-Mm-hmm.
-We-we speaking out.

1471
01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:24.163
Sam. you have possibly
one of the most effective.

1472
01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:26.957
beautiful outlets of us all.

1473
01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:28.584
Y-You’re not using it
to help the cause. brother.

1474
01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:30.794
The hell I’m not.

1475
01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:33.172
I got the masters to my songs.

1476
01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:34.465
I started a label.

1477
01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:35.883
I’m producing
tons of Black artists.

1478
01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:38.302
Don’t you think my determining

1479
01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.179
my creative
and business destiny

1480
01:00:40.262 --> 01:00:42.056
is every bit
as inspiring to people

1481
01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:44.975
as you standing up on a podium
trying to piss them off?

1482
01:00:45.059 --> 01:00:47.227
Oh. wait a minute. I forgot.

1483
01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:49.355
That’s all you do!

1484
01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:50.856
Sam. I do plenty.

1485
01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:53.025
Oh. do you? Let’s see.
You suck at sports.

1486
01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:54.318
Well. I-I was never
much into football.

1487
01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:55.527
SAM:
Can’t sing.

1488
01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:57.738
Damn sure can’t make shit
out of no peanut.

1489
01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.281
Is there a point
to this rant. Sam?

1490
01:00:59.365 --> 01:01:01.158
My point is that sometimes
I feel like you’re just like

1491
01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:03.160
all the rest of them people out
there. obsessed with the stars.

1492
01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.953
-(laughing)
-Oh. no. no. no. Cash.

1493
01:01:05.037 --> 01:01:06.205
-SAM: You look around.
Look around. -Let him finish.

1494
01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:08.499
SAM:
Which one of us don’t belong?

1495
01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:11.418
-Don’t belong?
-(chuckles): Don’t belong.

1496
01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:13.045
Brother Sam.
the only person here

1497
01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:15.047
white people seem to like--

1498
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.423
that would be you.

1499
01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:18.258
-(laughs) -Hey. y’all need
to cool it now. man.

1500
01:01:18.342 --> 01:01:21.261
You know. you always managed
to just be around for shit.

1501
01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:22.471
haven’t you?

1502
01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:24.181
Maybe your daddy
should’ve beaten you better.

1503
01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:25.974
-Jimmy. I’m gonna kick this
motherfucker’s ass. -Oh. whoa.

1504
01:01:26.058 --> 01:01:27.726
You can let him go. Let him go.

1505
01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:29.061
Everything all right.
Brother Malcolm?

1506
01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:30.646
-SAM: What do you want?
-Hey. Hey.

1507
01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:31.939
-Get your motherfucking hands
off me! -Hey. Hey.

1508
01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.732
Oh. I don’t think so.

1509
01:01:33.816 --> 01:01:36.360
Our job here is to protect
the brother minister.

1510
01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:39.154
Listen. Kareem. I don’t need
your protection. brother.

1511
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:45.869
Well. now that that’s settled.
away you go.

1512
01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:47.663
Negro. I will leave
when I am good...

1513
01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:48.831
You best think long and hard

1514
01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:50.958
’fore you wag that tongue
at me.

1515
01:01:57.548 --> 01:01:58.674
God is great.

1516
01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.467
MALCOLM:
Yeah. greater than any of us.

1517
01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:08.851
Ah. yeah.

1518
01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:11.103
♪ ♪

1519
01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:16.316
Your security people
are assholes.

1520
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.277
Yeah. I don’t choose them.

1521
01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.570
What’s wrong with you. Sam?

1522
01:02:19.653 --> 01:02:21.280
You’re supposed to be
smooth. man.

1523
01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:24.199
Ain’t easy being smooth with
this sandpaper nigga around.

1524
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.119
(sighs):
Shit.

1525
01:02:41.175 --> 01:02:43.594
(sighs)

1526
01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:45.095
You two done fighting now?

1527
01:02:45.179 --> 01:02:47.014
SAM: I wasn’t trying
to fight nobody.

1528
01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.724
That’s Malcolm.

1529
01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:50.851
Always pissed off.

1530
01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:56.482
"Pissed off"?

1531
01:02:58.066 --> 01:02:59.818
You say "pissed off."
Brother Sam?

1532
01:02:59.902 --> 01:03:01.862
You know. what is
going on around us.

1533
01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:04.615
it should make everyone angry.

1534
01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:07.409
Uh. you know.
you bourgeois Negroes.

1535
01:03:07.493 --> 01:03:09.828
you’re too happy.
uh. with your scraps

1536
01:03:09.912 --> 01:03:13.373
to really understand
what is at stake here.

1537
01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:16.210
What. you-you think
Cash being the world champ

1538
01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:18.921
is gonna protect him
from the devils

1539
01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:21.590
that harassed him from
the first day that he got here?

1540
01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:23.133
Mm. I’d like to see them try.

1541
01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:25.219
-MALCOLM: Huh? And Jimmy.
-JIM: Hmm?

1542
01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.387
Jimmy is the best
football player in the world.

1543
01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:29.598
but he is also giving money
to Black-owned businesses.

1544
01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:31.808
What. you-you don’t think
that-that threatens

1545
01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:32.893
a lot of white people?

1546
01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:33.977
Hmm?

1547
01:03:34.061 --> 01:03:35.187
You don’t think the FBI is

1548
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.438
probably starting
to follow him around. too?

1549
01:03:36.522 --> 01:03:37.940
Oh. man. now you’re gonna
fucking jinx me.

1550
01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:39.566
And that is why. Brother Sam.

1551
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:43.779
this-this movement that
we are in is called a struggle.

1552
01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:46.907
Because we are fighting
for our lives!

1553
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.700
(laughs)

1554
01:03:48.784 --> 01:03:51.203
And what words are we hearing
from you. brother?

1555
01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:55.165
Mm. Mr. Soul.

1556
01:03:58.085 --> 01:04:01.213
(needle drops. record crackles)

1557
01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:06.593
♪ Darling. you send me ♪

1558
01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:09.805
♪ I know you send me ♪

1559
01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:11.306
Or maybe this one.

1560
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:13.433
-♪ Darling. y... ♪
-(music stops)

1561
01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:18.313
♪ I love you. I love you.

1562
01:04:18.397 --> 01:04:21.441
♪ I love you.

1563
01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:23.443
-♪ I love you. I love you.

1564
01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:25.237
-♪ I love you. I love you.
I love you ♪ -(laughs)

1565
01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:29.491

-♪ I hope you do
believe me... ♪ -Oh.

1569
01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:41.670
-Wow. Sam.
-(music stops)

1570
01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:43.338
Your music is deep. brother.

1571
01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:45.215
Hey. man. I love them songs.

1572
01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:46.842
Back-never-facing-the-door.
bean-pie-eating.

1573
01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:48.010
self-righteous motherfucker.

1574
01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.428
And. to boot. most of them are

1575
01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:52.598
versions of the church songs
that nurtured you.

1576
01:04:52.681 --> 01:04:54.891
You-you twisted them
and you perverted them

1577
01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:56.893
to feed a-a white crowd.

1578
01:04:56.977 --> 01:04:58.437
SAM:
That is bullshit.

1579
01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.440
Most of the artists I work with
are gospel sing--

1580
01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:03.650
And do you have any idea what
I’ve given back to the church?

1581
01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:05.861
Do you know-- h-how many times
do I have to hear that. Jimmy?

1582
01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:07.446
You know. that has got to be
the greatest fault

1583
01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:10.198
of you so-called.
uh. successful Negroes.

1584
01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:12.034
-You’ll do something
detrimental... -Here he goes.

1585
01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:14.244
...to your own people
with the promise that-that.

1586
01:05:14.328 --> 01:05:16.997
after you get rich. then you’re
gonna make it back up to them.

1587
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.749
With-with a handout.

1588
01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:20.542
Or some gesture of patronage.

1589
01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:22.919
-Malcolm. Malcolm. all right.
-No. Jimmy.

1590
01:05:23.003 --> 01:05:25.631
And what you don’t get.
Brother Sam:

1591
01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:27.674
you’ve made it. brother.

1592
01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:30.260
But for all the others.
the majority of people

1593
01:05:30.344 --> 01:05:31.970
who had their own
self-destructive dreams

1594
01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:35.390
and didn’t make it.
what they left behind?

1595
01:05:35.474 --> 01:05:38.810
No. all they left behind
is a legacy of negativity!

1596
01:05:38.894 --> 01:05:40.437
But that’s okay.
’cause they all meant well.

1597
01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.522
JIM: Malcolm. will you please
have some damn ice cream?

1598
01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:44.524
You will never be loved
by the people

1599
01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:47.194
you’re trying so hard
to win over.

1600
01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:48.445
Never.

1601
01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:51.990
You’re just a windup toy
in a music box.

1602
01:05:52.074 --> 01:05:53.867
A-A monkey.

1603
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.369
That’s what you are.

1604
01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:58.997
You’re a monkey dancing
for an organ grinder to them.

1605
01:06:02.751 --> 01:06:04.336
(whistles)

1606
01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:06.755
Y’all pulled out the knives.

1607
01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:10.175
And if I get cut.
I’m fittin’ to hurt somebody.

1608
01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:17.724
(sighs)

1609
01:06:24.481 --> 01:06:27.109
MALCOLM: Cassius.
who-who were those English boys

1610
01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:29.403
you-you were hanging out with
a couple days ago?

1611
01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:30.779
CASSIUS:
The Beatles.

1612
01:06:30.862 --> 01:06:32.948
MALCOLM:
Yes. The "Be-a-tles."

1613
01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:35.575
(Malcolm scoffs)

1614
01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.619
All that time you spent
on the road. Sam.

1615
01:06:37.703 --> 01:06:41.123
entertaining the children
of bigots.

1616
01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:43.667
and at the end of the day.
white folks would still rather

1617
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:44.960
import their popular music.

1618
01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:47.170
CASSIUS:
Just hold on one second.

1619
01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:51.758
Now. yeah. The Beatles.
th-they’re funny...

1620
01:06:53.427 --> 01:06:55.929
...but they ain’t no Sam Cooke.

1621
01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:58.181
(chuckles softly)

1622
01:06:58.265 --> 01:07:00.475
They’re-they’re...
they’re more of a fad.

1623
01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:04.604
Yeah. well. if not them.
then-then someone else. Cash.

1624
01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:09.192
The bottom line: this is
too important a time. brother.

1625
01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:11.403
to be wasting a-a brilliant

1626
01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:14.072
and-and creative mind
on pandering.

1627
01:07:14.156 --> 01:07:16.324
And it’s too damn hot in here
to be wearing that blazer.

1628
01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:17.951
So what’s your point?

1629
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.494
My-my point is.

1630
01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:22.914
Brother Sam. that I am just
one voice in this struggle.

1631
01:07:22.998 --> 01:07:24.666
Just one.

1632
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.543
And Cassius. Cassius--
he’s another

1633
01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:30.630
who-who pushes us forward with
his fists and with his words.

1634
01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:34.092
And Jimmy. Jimmy pushes us
forward with his fearlessness

1635
01:07:34.176 --> 01:07:36.928
and-and his relentlessness.

1636
01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:38.430
My point is that you. brother.

1637
01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:41.850
you could be the loudest voice
of us all.

1638
01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:47.272
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
says that if we...

1639
01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:48.607
No. hold on. hold on.

1640
01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:49.941
Now. I ain’t ask you

1641
01:07:50.025 --> 01:07:51.193
what the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad thought.

1642
01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.528
I asked you what you thought.

1643
01:07:53.612 --> 01:07:55.071
There you go with.

1644
01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:56.490
"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
says this.

1645
01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:59.159
Honorable Elijah Muhammad
says that."

1646
01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:01.244
And when the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad tells you

1647
01:08:01.328 --> 01:08:02.746
to shut the fuck up.

1648
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:04.873
-you damn sure do that. too.
-No.

1649
01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:06.374
What is going on
between the Nation and me. Sam.

1650
01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.210
-is way more complicated.
-But you still obey them.

1651
01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:09.294
When they tell you
to come out here

1652
01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:11.421
and-and recruit Cassius

1653
01:08:11.505 --> 01:08:12.923
to become a member of something
you don’t even seem to believe!

1654
01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:14.341
What are you talking about?
I’m not making-- I’m not--

1655
01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.550
I’m not making Cassius
do anything!

1656
01:08:15.634 --> 01:08:17.594
Ca-- He came to me for insight.

1657
01:08:17.677 --> 01:08:19.679
He-he had questions.
(stammers)

1658
01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:22.224
His passion for Islam
comes from a pure place. Sam.

1659
01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:24.768
CASSIUS:
"Passion" is...

1660
01:08:24.851 --> 01:08:25.852
(exhales)

1661
01:08:25.936 --> 01:08:28.104
...kind of a strong word.

1662
01:08:39.658 --> 01:08:41.993
Well. you couldn’t stop talking
about how excited you were

1663
01:08:42.077 --> 01:08:44.621
-to come out with your faith
to the world. Cash. -True.

1664
01:08:44.704 --> 01:08:46.998
True. I was.
I am. It’s just that...

1665
01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:48.792
-What is it? -If we’re being
completely honest and all.

1666
01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.794
I guess being a Muslim

1667
01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:55.090
sounded like a much better idea
before tonight.

1668
01:08:59.928 --> 01:09:03.515
How could you have
any second thoughts. Cash? I...

1669
01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:05.475
You’re on top of the world.
I-I don’t understand.

1670
01:09:05.559 --> 01:09:09.104
He didn’t actually think he was
gonna win tonight. Malcolm.

1671
01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:11.439
-Cash?
-Course I knew.

1672
01:09:11.523 --> 01:09:13.441
I’m the best...
(exhales)

1673
01:09:13.525 --> 01:09:14.901
I’m the greatest
there ever will be.

1674
01:09:14.985 --> 01:09:16.570
-I’m-I’m just saying that...
-Easy. Cassius.

1675
01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.071
No. I’m good.

1676
01:09:19.114 --> 01:09:21.449
I’m just a little nervous
is all.

1677
01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:23.493
That’s natural. ain’t it?

1678
01:09:27.539 --> 01:09:29.332
Malcolm.

1679
01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:36.631
SAM: It takes a hustler
to see a hustle.

1680
01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:41.261
Say. let me ask you something.
Mr. Know-It-All.

1681
01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:48.685
How is it helpful
for Black people

1682
01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:52.314
to run their businesses
different than everyone else’s?

1683
01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:54.524
Dumber than everyone else’s?

1684
01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:56.109
No.

1685
01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.695
No one’s accused you of making
bad business decisions. Sam.

1686
01:09:58.778 --> 01:10:00.196
You might as well have.

1687
01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.657
You think I don’t know
about the British Invasion?

1688
01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:06.494
I invested
in the British Invasion.

1689
01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:10.248
I have these protégés.

1690
01:10:10.332 --> 01:10:11.416
Valentinos.

1691
01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:13.418
Five Womack brothers.

1692
01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:17.088
The youngest one. Bobby. wrote
this song. "It’s All Over Now."

1693
01:10:17.172 --> 01:10:18.798
Great tune.

1694
01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:20.800
The band records it.
It’s fantastic.

1695
01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:22.385
All over the R&B charts.

1696
01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:27.140
It even went to number 94
on Billboard’s Hot 100.

1697
01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.559
Then I get a call from England.

1698
01:10:29.643 --> 01:10:31.478
One of these British bands
wants to record

1699
01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.063
-a cover version.
-The Beatles?

1700
01:10:33.146 --> 01:10:35.148
Nah. Cash. They call themselves
the Rolling Stones.

1701
01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.608
Oh. like the Muddy Waters song.

1702
01:10:36.691 --> 01:10:37.984
SAM:
Exactly.

1703
01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:39.653
So. Bobby’s like. you know.
"No damn way. man.

1704
01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.029
That’s our song. man."

1705
01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:43.073
But... I get the final say.

1706
01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:44.866
and I’m looking
at the big picture.

1707
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:47.619
And I give the Rolling Stones
permission to record it.

1708
01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:49.871
-You did?
-I did.

1709
01:10:49.955 --> 01:10:51.331
Mm. mm. mm.

1710
01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.667
And the Rolling Stones’ version
of the song

1711
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.336
goes all the way to number one.

1712
01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.797
Not on the R&B charts.

1713
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.924
Pop charts.

1714
01:11:01.007 --> 01:11:02.884
But. of course. you know.

1715
01:11:02.968 --> 01:11:04.302
once this version
of the song gets big.

1716
01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:06.471
Bobby’s version
just disappears.

1717
01:11:06.554 --> 01:11:08.723
Right? Falls off
the R&B charts. It’s just gone.

1718
01:11:08.807 --> 01:11:10.767
So. of course. Bobby’s crushed.

1719
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.727
Yes. as well he should be. Sam.

1720
01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:15.397
Let me finish.

1721
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.316
He’s crushed
for about six months.

1722
01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:21.611
Because. six months later.

1723
01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:24.030
that first royalty check
comes in.

1724
01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:25.115
(snaps fingers)

1725
01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:26.700
And because Bobby’s the writer

1726
01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.535
and my company owns
the rights to the song.

1727
01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:31.079
-that means every time...
-(snapping fingers)

1728
01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:34.082
some white girl buys
a copy of that single.

1729
01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:36.209
she putting money
into my pockets.

1730
01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.086
Our pockets.

1731
01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:39.337
(Malcolm chuckling softly)

1732
01:11:39.421 --> 01:11:40.797
White boys out there
touring around.

1733
01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.716
they ain’t even know
they working for us.

1734
01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:43.883
Next thing you know.
Bobby’s like.

1735
01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.051
"The Rolling Stones
want to cover

1736
01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:46.594
any more versions of my songs?"

1737
01:11:46.678 --> 01:11:48.513
(chuckles)
You know who gets paid more

1738
01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:49.889
than the writer of a song

1739
01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:52.267
that hits number 94
on the Billboard Hot 100?

1740
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:55.020
-Hmm? -The writer of a song
that hits number one.

1741
01:11:55.103 --> 01:11:56.438
I already knew that.

1742
01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.189
Now Bobby knows it. too.

1743
01:11:58.273 --> 01:11:59.649
Tell me
how it’s not empowerment.

1744
01:11:59.733 --> 01:12:01.151
Everybody talks about
they want a piece of the pie.

1745
01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:02.485
Well. I don’t.

1746
01:12:02.569 --> 01:12:05.905
I want the goddamn recipe.

1747
01:12:07.866 --> 01:12:10.660
I congratulate you
on being so shrewd. brother.

1748
01:12:10.744 --> 01:12:12.620
You just don’t get
how everything’s not

1749
01:12:12.704 --> 01:12:14.581
so black and white
like you make it out to be.

1750
01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:17.250
In your mind. President Kennedy
getting assassinated

1751
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.710
is just another one
of those white devils

1752
01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:19.794
getting what they deserve.

1753
01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:21.421
Well. I liked JFK. man.

1754
01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.339
My mama cried when he died.

1755
01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:24.466
Mine did. too.

1756
01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:26.134
How do you think
it made me feel

1757
01:12:26.217 --> 01:12:27.761
to have her see my friend
on TV.

1758
01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:28.970
talking about "good riddance"?

1759
01:12:29.054 --> 01:12:30.555
No. I-I didn’t.
I didn’t say-- No.

1760
01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:32.098
Sam. I didn’t say
"good riddance."

1761
01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:34.100
You said it was "chickens
coming home to roost"!

1762
01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:36.728
Yes. I was trying
to make a point. brother!

1763
01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:38.188
-You were paraphrasing.
-SAM: Tell you something else.

1764
01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:40.857
My whole family lives
on the South Side of Chicago.

1765
01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.776
not up in Harlem where you are.

1766
01:12:42.859 --> 01:12:45.361
-The Black Muslims...
-"The Nation of Islam" to you.

1767
01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:48.364
The Nation of Islam
is huge in Chicago.

1768
01:12:48.448 --> 01:12:51.076
I know where
Elijah Muhammad’s house is.

1769
01:12:51.159 --> 01:12:52.744
It’s the biggest one
for miles around.

1770
01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:54.412
Looks like
the mayor’s residence.

1771
01:12:54.496 --> 01:12:55.497
Oh. yeah.
I been there for dinner.

1772
01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:56.581
Oh. you been there for dinner.

1773
01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:59.084
So you see how
he lives like a pharaoh.

1774
01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:01.377
Never says nothing about
the crooked Black alderman

1775
01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:03.755
who’s running numbers.
pushing drugs.

1776
01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:06.049
doing all the things
to hurt the community.

1777
01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:08.760
meanwhile condemning
those white devils.

1778
01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:11.346
Come off it. Malcolm.

1779
01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:14.808
(lighter clicks open)

1780
01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:21.189
(chuckles)

1781
01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:23.733
Oh. I got something
for your ass.

1782
01:13:27.487 --> 01:13:29.823
-SAM: ♪ Dum. da-dum. dum. ♪
-(paper crinkling)

1783
01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:32.450
This is the clue that’s gonna
solve the crime. Officer?

1784
01:13:32.534 --> 01:13:34.994
Oh. you could say that.

1785
01:13:35.078 --> 01:13:38.414
You know. I was thinking about
this song I heard on the radio

1786
01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:40.166
the other day. Sam.

1787
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:44.003
It’s a song
that made me think of you.

1788
01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:46.714
Turns out it’s pretty popular.

1789
01:13:50.385 --> 01:13:53.096
("Blowin’ in the Wind"
by Bob Dylan playing)

1790

1800
01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:35.597
Ooh!

1801
01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.849
-(music stops)
-I just love those lyrics.

1802
01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:41.436
Especially in the beginning.

1803
01:14:42.562 --> 01:14:46.441
"How many roads
must a man walk down

1804
01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:49.068
before you can call him a man?"

1805
01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:50.403
It’s as though he’s asking.

1806
01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.322
"How much do the oppressed
have to do

1807
01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:56.534
before they can be recognized
as human beings?"

1808
01:14:56.618 --> 01:14:58.119
That really gets you thinking.
don’t it?

1809
01:14:58.203 --> 01:15:00.038
I already know
"Blowin’ in the Wind." Malcolm.

1810
01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:02.373
I heard it
when it first came out.

1811
01:15:02.457 --> 01:15:03.666
It didn’t make you angry?

1812
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:05.627
Why would it?

1813
01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:10.006
Isn’t this Bob Dylan fella
a white boy from Minnesota?

1814
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:12.508
So what?

1815
01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:14.552
So?

1816
01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:19.224
This is a white boy
from Minnesota

1817
01:15:19.307 --> 01:15:22.393
who has nothing to gain
from writing a song

1818
01:15:22.477 --> 01:15:25.521
that speaks more
to the struggles of our people.

1819
01:15:25.605 --> 01:15:26.981
more to the movement.

1820
01:15:27.065 --> 01:15:29.317
than anything
that you have ever penned

1821
01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.736
in your life. brother.

1822
01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:34.614
I-I know I’m not the shrewd
businessperson you are.

1823
01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:36.658
my brother. but since you say

1824
01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:39.911
being vocally in the struggle
is bad for business.

1825
01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:42.205
why has this old song
gone higher on the pop charts

1826
01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:43.498
than anything you got out?

1827
01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:50.838
Why has this song gone higher

1828
01:15:50.922 --> 01:15:53.174
(chuckles):
on the pop charts

1829
01:15:53.258 --> 01:15:56.261
than anything you got out?

1830
01:15:56.344 --> 01:15:57.845
Hmm?

1831
01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:12.110
-Nope. nope. nope. nope. nope.
-Sam.

1832
01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:13.486
-JIM: Come on. Sam.
-Sam.

1833
01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:14.821
Come back here. man.

1834
01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:15.905
-Sam!
-Sam!

1835
01:16:15.989 --> 01:16:18.283
JIM:
Goddamn it.

1836
01:16:18.366 --> 01:16:20.451
Good riddance.

1837
01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:36.134
That wasn’t necessary.

1838
01:16:36.217 --> 01:16:38.845
Yes. that absolutely
was necessary. Cash.

1839
01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.680
-We’re supposed
to be friends. man! -Yes!

1840
01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:42.890
Well. I am his friend.
and that is why

1841
01:16:42.974 --> 01:16:46.936
I am trying to give him
a wake-up call!

1842
01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:51.190
There is no more room
for anyone--

1843
01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:54.402
not you. not me.
not Jimmy. not Sam--

1844
01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:58.031
no one to be standing
on the fence anymore!

1845
01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:03.077
Our people are literally dying
in the streets every day!

1846
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:07.415
Black people are dying!

1847
01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:09.625
Every day!

1848
01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:14.547
And a line has got to be drawn
in the sand. Jimmy.

1849
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:18.009
A line that says. "Either
you stand on this side with us.

1850
01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:20.428
or you stand over on that side
against us." Cash.

1851
01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:22.013
And I-I believe.

1852
01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:24.974
I believe in that brother’s
potential. Jimmy.

1853
01:17:25.058 --> 01:17:26.392
too much!

1854
01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:30.021
Too much to let him stay
over on the other side.

1855
01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:34.567
CASSIUS: I better go get him
before he drives off.

1856
01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:38.654
(breathing sharply)

1857
01:17:38.738 --> 01:17:40.948
(door opens. closes)

1858
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.752
(groans softly)

1859
01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:55.380
(grunts)

1860
01:17:55.463 --> 01:17:57.673
(breathing heavily)

1861
01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.734
You know...

1862
01:18:16.818 --> 01:18:19.904
I always find it kind of funny
how you light-skinned cats

1863
01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:23.199
end up being so damn militant.

1864
01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:27.161
-How...
-(chuckles)

1865
01:18:27.245 --> 01:18:29.414
(chuckles)

1866
01:18:30.248 --> 01:18:31.874
What do you mean?

1867
01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:35.545
Well. you are yellow
as the sun.

1868
01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.672
When I think
about who the most outspoken.

1869
01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:40.883
consequences-be-damned brothers
out there are.

1870
01:18:40.967 --> 01:18:42.135
it’s always
you light-skinned boys.

1871
01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:44.345
You know. you. W.E.B. Du Bois.

1872
01:18:44.429 --> 01:18:45.638
Adam Clayton Powell...

1873
01:18:45.721 --> 01:18:47.223
Well. I-I...

1874
01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:49.559
I never pay any attention
to complexions. Jimmy.

1875
01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:52.603
because we are all.
we are all Black people.

1876
01:18:52.687 --> 01:18:55.648
Don’t suddenly talk to me
like I’m stupid.

1877
01:18:56.816 --> 01:18:59.402
You know we are all
far from the same.

1878
01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:01.487
When the white folks
ain’t around.

1879
01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:03.614
you see
the-the light-skinned girls

1880
01:19:03.698 --> 01:19:05.199
gather together in one corner.

1881
01:19:05.283 --> 01:19:07.618
all the dark-skinned girls
gather in the other and...

1882
01:19:07.702 --> 01:19:08.786
You know.

1883
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:09.954

1884
01:19:10.037 --> 01:19:11.497

1885

1886
01:19:12.874 --> 01:19:15.209
than they do
from the white people.

1887
01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:19.589
Yeah. What are you
trying to say?

1888
01:19:21.591 --> 01:19:23.801
I just wonder
if all this pushing

1889

and "hard line" this
and "hard line" that

1890
01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:29.765
is really about trying to prove
something to white people.

1891
01:19:29.849 --> 01:19:31.225
or...

1892
01:19:31.309 --> 01:19:33.060

is it about trying

1893

1897

1902
01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:58.085

1903
01:19:58.169 --> 01:19:59.629

1904
01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:01.297
He’s got to be.

1905
01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:04.258
I mean. if the goal is
for us to be free.

1906
01:20:04.342 --> 01:20:06.552
to really be free...

1907
01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:07.762
And you know it is.

1908
01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:12.225
...then the key
is economic freedom.

1909
01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:15.561
And no one’s more
economically free than Sam.

1910
01:20:15.645 --> 01:20:17.772

white folks are masters at

1921

is tapping into our passions
to a point

1922
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:48.844

some white folks...

1929
01:21:08.698 --> 01:21:10.908
some white folks
just cannot wait

1930
01:21:10.992 --> 01:21:14.954
to pat themselves on the back
for not being cruel to us.

1931

singing hosannas

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:06.513
Malcolm.

2056
01:27:06.597 --> 01:27:07.806
SAM:
Okay.

2057
01:27:09.266 --> 01:27:10.935
All right.

2058
01:27:11.018 --> 01:27:14.188
Sam. what is this. uh.
this problem between us. Sam?

2059
01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:16.315
I don’t got no problem
with you.

2060
01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:18.233
I got a problem with this guy.

2061
01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:22.988
You used to be. you used to be
such a fun cat.

2062
01:27:23.072 --> 01:27:25.532
Now you acting in private
the way you are on camera.

2063
01:27:25.616 --> 01:27:27.952
Sam. I-I...

2064
01:27:28.035 --> 01:27:29.662
was always this person.

2065
01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:33.582
Maybe. but you were also
always so much...

2066
01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.544
...more.

2067
01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:42.675
Fellas. y’all ready?

2068
01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:53.352
You remember. uh.
the first time we met. Sam?

2069
01:27:53.435 --> 01:27:55.020
I’m tired of answering
your questions. man.

2070
01:27:55.104 --> 01:27:56.647
Is that a no?

2071
01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:58.482
(sighs)

2072
01:27:58.565 --> 01:27:59.984
Of course I do.

2073
01:28:00.067 --> 01:28:03.320
It was. uh... Harlem.

2074
01:28:03.404 --> 01:28:05.572
You didn’t even know who I was.

2075
01:28:05.656 --> 01:28:06.865
Uh-huh.

2076
01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:09.868
I said that at the time.
but I knew who you were.

2077
01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:12.162
A lot of the brothers
had been requesting shifts

2078
01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:13.956
-outside the Apollo that week.
-Is that a fact?

2079
01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:15.416
That’s a fact.

2080
01:28:15.499 --> 01:28:16.750
And I understood

2081
01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:19.545
because I caught
one of your shows in Chicago.

2082
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:22.423
You’ve been to one of my shows?

2083
01:28:22.506 --> 01:28:26.093
No. I’ve. uh. been to...

2084
01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:30.347
...five of them.

2085
01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:33.100
Including the one in Boston.

2086
01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:36.437
(chuckles):
Shit. Boston?

2087
01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.521
Really?

2088
01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:39.565
Mm-hmm. Really.

2089
01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:41.358
(laughing)

2090
01:28:41.442 --> 01:28:43.193
Well. hell. what happened
in Boston?

2091
01:28:43.277 --> 01:28:45.821
You mind if I recount
the story. Sam?

2092
01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:46.905
No. no. Go ahead.

2093
01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:47.990
-MALCOLM: Yeah?
-Yeah.

2094
01:28:48.073 --> 01:28:50.075
-(cheering and applause)
-Well. uh.

2095
01:28:50.159 --> 01:28:52.661

playing with Jackie Wilson...

01:28:57.791 --> 01:28:59.752
but Jackie was the opener.

2100
01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:01.503
He was doing
his usual routine.

2101
01:29:01.587 --> 01:29:04.214

and. you know. Sam was
getting ready to come onstage.

2108
01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:21.607
-(holding high note)
-(cheering)

2109
01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:22.816
Yeah. I knew he was

2110
01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:25.360

01:29:26.487 --> 01:29:29.073
Yeah! Hey!

2113
01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.497
I warmed them up for you.
brother.

2114
01:29:37.581 --> 01:29:39.249
Don’t fuck up now.

-(pats chest)

2116
01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:45.589
Ladies and gentlemen.
let’s give it up for Sam Cooke!

2117
01:29:45.672 --> 01:29:49.051
MALCOLM: Sam comes. uh.
strolling out onto the stage.

2118
01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:50.135
Cash. the crowd--

2119
01:29:50.219 --> 01:29:51.887
Boom. Wow.

2120
01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:53.972
Ah! Boston!

2121
01:29:54.056 --> 01:29:55.599
(cheering)

2122
01:29:55.682 --> 01:29:57.601
Thank you.

2123
01:29:57.684 --> 01:29:59.019
WOMAN:
Sam. I love you!

2124
01:29:59.103 --> 01:30:00.771
MALCOLM: Sam steps up
to the microphone.

2125
01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:02.606
wraps his hand around it--
you know how Sam does.

2126
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:04.775
like. uh. he caresses it.
like. uh.

2127
01:30:04.858 --> 01:30:07.152
one might caress
a delicate piece of crystal.

2128
01:30:07.236 --> 01:30:09.446
-(chuckles)
-Or a pretty little fox.

2129
01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:11.323
An NFL championship trophy.

2130
01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:13.617
-You want me to finish this
story. Jimmy? -Oh. go ahead.

2131
01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:16.703
Yeah. Like I was saying.
he-he... he caresses the mic.

2132
01:30:16.787 --> 01:30:19.248
pulls it close to his lips.
opens his mouth...

2133
01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:21.834
-♪ Darling. you... ♪
-(feedback squealing)

2134
01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:23.377
Sound went out.

2135
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.628
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

2136
01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:26.630
(audience murmuring)

2137
01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:28.841
-That wasn’t the sound system.
was it? -(audience booing)

2138
01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:35.973
The microphone is off!

2139
01:30:39.059 --> 01:30:41.395
MALCOLM: I know. H-How’s that
for some bad luck?

2140
01:30:41.478 --> 01:30:43.313
Bad luck. my ass.

2141
01:30:43.397 --> 01:30:44.857
Jackie was always
the king of sabotage.

2142
01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:48.443
MALCOLM: Regardless.
Sam was now stuck onstage

2143
01:30:48.527 --> 01:30:52.239
with no sound
and a worked-up Boston crowd.

2144
01:30:52.322 --> 01:30:53.866
Well. things
escalated quickly.

2145
01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:56.076
My band was out of there
like some runaway slaves.

2146
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.703
Where the fuck y’all going?

2147
01:30:57.786 --> 01:30:59.621
We’re musicians.
not bodyguards. baby.

2148
01:30:59.705 --> 01:31:00.956
Good luck.

2149
01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:03.792
But Sam. he just. he just
stood there on that stage.

2150
01:31:03.876 --> 01:31:05.586
(booing continues)

2151
01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:08.672
I remember thinking to myself.

2152
01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:11.008
"This young brother is fittin’
to get himself killed."

2153
01:31:11.091 --> 01:31:12.384
CASSIUS:
W-Well. then what happened?

2154
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:15.095
Something. uh...

2155
01:31:16.638 --> 01:31:18.515
Something amazing happened.

2156
01:31:18.599 --> 01:31:20.267
(booing continues)

2157
01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.104
Y’all know "Chain Gang"?
All right.

2158
01:31:24.188 --> 01:31:25.689
I’m-a. I’m-a do it
a cappella. all right?

2159
01:31:25.772 --> 01:31:28.150
(speaking indistinctly)

2160
01:31:28.233 --> 01:31:30.444
-MAN: I’ll kick your ass!
-(angry chatter)

2161
01:31:30.527 --> 01:31:32.362
All right. let’s go.

2162
01:31:32.446 --> 01:31:33.697
-All right.
-Let’s go.

2163
01:31:35.449 --> 01:31:37.951
(grunting rhythmically)

2164
01:31:42.164 --> 01:31:44.333
(booing quiets)

2165
01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:45.500
Come on. (grunts)

2183
01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:41.640
covered in sweat and...
and singing to ’em.

2184
01:32:41.723 --> 01:32:43.392
But. you know.
in the back where I was.

2185
01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:45.102
you couldn’t hear anything
except that chant.

2186
01:32:45.185 --> 01:32:47.771
(grunting and stomping
drown out singing)

2187
01:32:47.854 --> 01:32:50.315
You know. and...
you know what?

2188
01:32:50.399 --> 01:32:54.444
That was. uh...
that was good enough.

2189
01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:57.906
Yes. that was...

2190
01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:01.618
...that was
one hell of a show. Sam.

2191
01:33:01.702 --> 01:33:05.330
(stomping and grunting
continue)

2192
01:33:05.414 --> 01:33:07.749
CASSIUS:
That sounds like something.

2193
01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:11.044
It really was. Cash.

2194
01:33:11.128 --> 01:33:13.505
It really was.

2195
01:33:15.299 --> 01:33:19.344
Brother. you could
move mountains

2196
01:33:19.428 --> 01:33:21.638
without lifting a finger.

2197
01:33:24.057 --> 01:33:26.393
Listen. if-if I give you
a hard time. it’s...

2198
01:33:26.476 --> 01:33:29.313
you know. it’s only because
I-I think so highly of you.

2199
01:33:30.981 --> 01:33:32.816
You know. you brothers.
you-you all are-are

2200
01:33:32.899 --> 01:33:34.276
our bright and shining future.

2201
01:33:34.359 --> 01:33:37.904
I... I never. I never
lose sight of that.

2202
01:33:37.988 --> 01:33:40.782
Well. you’re part of
that future. too. Malcolm.

2203
01:33:40.866 --> 01:33:43.035
(Cassius chuckles)

2204
01:33:44.369 --> 01:33:45.912
I’m flattered. really. I’m...

2205
01:33:45.996 --> 01:33:48.665
Taking the world
on your shoulders is

2206
01:33:48.749 --> 01:33:50.042
bad for your health.

2207
01:33:50.125 --> 01:33:51.501
Yeah. well.

2208
01:33:51.585 --> 01:33:54.421
he won’t have to carry it
by himself much longer.

2209
01:33:54.504 --> 01:33:57.841
’Cause we gonna be
in the Nation together.

2210
01:34:00.927 --> 01:34:02.346
Malcolm...

2211
01:34:02.429 --> 01:34:04.056
I know.

2212
01:34:05.557 --> 01:34:07.017
I know.

2213
01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:10.395
What is it?

2214
01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:16.151
Malcolm?

2215
01:34:20.072 --> 01:34:22.407
Well. like I said. my. um...

2216
01:34:22.491 --> 01:34:26.370
my relationship
with. uh. the Nation has...

2217
01:34:26.453 --> 01:34:28.663
has gotten complicated.

2218
01:34:30.165 --> 01:34:33.418
I-I don’t know how much longer
I’ll be in it.

2219
01:34:34.961 --> 01:34:38.340
Wait a second. You’re leaving
the Nation of Islam?

2220
01:34:40.092 --> 01:34:42.928
I thought once you went in.
you were in it for life.

2221
01:34:43.011 --> 01:34:45.806
(chuckles):
I guess I’ll be. uh...

2222
01:34:45.889 --> 01:34:48.308
I’ll be putting that theory
to the test. Sam.

2223
01:34:48.392 --> 01:34:50.727
CASSIUS:
Why would you want to leave?

2224
01:34:53.772 --> 01:34:55.482
All the things you told me.

2225
01:34:56.691 --> 01:34:59.236
The things you showed me
that the Nation does.

2226
01:34:59.319 --> 01:35:01.279
Oh. Cash. there’s...

2227
01:35:01.363 --> 01:35:03.281
there’s lots of good and
righteous brothers and sisters

2228
01:35:03.365 --> 01:35:06.284
in the Nation.
but it’s the leadership

2229
01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:08.620
that has-has shown
that it’s not up to the task.

2230
01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:10.539
Wait.

2231
01:35:10.622 --> 01:35:15.043
So you’re gonna help me
cross over to being a Muslim

2232
01:35:15.127 --> 01:35:17.129
and then quit being Muslim?

2233
01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:19.089
No. No. no. no. No. Cassius.

2234
01:35:19.172 --> 01:35:22.134
I will always.
always be Muslim.

2235
01:35:22.217 --> 01:35:25.512
I-In. you know. in fact. I-I...

2236
01:35:25.595 --> 01:35:31.059
I guess you could say. uh. I’m
becoming more Muslim than ever.

2237
01:35:33.478 --> 01:35:34.855
I’m not understanding.

2238
01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:37.732
Well. uh...

2239
01:35:37.816 --> 01:35:40.610
I’m not leaving just to be
out alone in the world.

2240
01:35:40.694 --> 01:35:42.612
I’m...

2241
01:35:42.696 --> 01:35:44.865
I’m leaving to...

2242
01:35:47.117 --> 01:35:49.035
I’m leaving to start
a new organization.

2243
01:35:49.119 --> 01:35:53.123
one-one that adheres
more closely to the. uh. honest

2244
01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:56.001
and. uh. righteous tenets
of Islam.

2245
01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:02.382
Who’s gonna be
in this new organization?

2246
01:36:02.466 --> 01:36:06.470
I think lots of people
will follow me over. Cash.

2247
01:36:06.553 --> 01:36:08.346
Especially. uh...

2248
01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:12.350
...i-if you-you come with me.

2249
01:36:28.492 --> 01:36:29.784
Say something.

2250
01:36:29.868 --> 01:36:31.453
-You motherfucker!
-Wait. wait. wait. wait.

2251
01:36:31.536 --> 01:36:33.413
Hey. hey. Cash. Cash. Cash.
Hey!

2252
01:36:33.497 --> 01:36:35.373
You’ve been using me!

2253
01:36:35.457 --> 01:36:37.000
No. no. brother.
I’m trying to save you.

2254
01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:39.169
-Wait. -You’re the only one
that needs saving!

2255
01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:41.213
-No.
-MALCOLM: Cash.

2256
01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:42.923
-(sighs)
-Cash.

2257
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:45.675
If you don’t believe
in your heart

2258
01:36:45.759 --> 01:36:48.345
I’ve been
an honest friend to you.

2259
01:36:48.428 --> 01:36:50.597
then-then you shouldn’t
join me. brother.

2260
01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.807
If there’s any-any part of you
that-that believes

2261
01:36:52.891 --> 01:36:55.393
that our time together
has been motivated in any way

2262
01:36:55.477 --> 01:37:00.023
by selfishness
or-or opportunism on my part...

2263
01:37:00.106 --> 01:37:02.692
brother. I...

2264
01:37:02.776 --> 01:37:04.986
brother. I encourage you.

2265
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:06.905
walk away from me.

2266
01:37:08.281 --> 01:37:10.575
Walk away from me with
a clear mind and conscience.

2267
01:37:10.659 --> 01:37:12.494
knowing that that is
the right thing.

2268
01:37:12.577 --> 01:37:14.788
that’s-that’s the only thing
you can do.

2269
01:37:22.003 --> 01:37:25.090
MAN: Cassius Marcellus Clay.
you in there. champ?

2270
01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:26.341
(knock on door)

2271
01:37:26.424 --> 01:37:27.842
MAN 2:
Tell us about what happened...

2272
01:37:27.926 --> 01:37:30.095
JAMAAL: We got a bunch
of reporters out here.

2273
01:37:30.178 --> 01:37:32.931
(reporters chattering)

2274
01:37:33.014 --> 01:37:35.100
There they are.

2275
01:37:36.726 --> 01:37:41.815
Some... someone must have saw
me and Sam downstairs.

2276
01:37:41.898 --> 01:37:45.694
Uh. well. you can’t blame them
for wanting a word

2277
01:37:45.777 --> 01:37:48.238
from the new world champion.

2278
01:37:48.321 --> 01:37:50.657
(Cassius clears throat. sighs)

2279
01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:53.827
Yeah. (sniffs)

2280
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:55.912
I guess I got to go
talk to them.

2281
01:37:55.996 --> 01:37:57.789
help them sell a few papers.

2282
01:37:57.872 --> 01:37:59.708
MALCOLM:
Absolutely.

2283
01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:14.973
(sighs)

2284
01:38:15.807 --> 01:38:17.726
You coming?

2285
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:27.611
Um...

2286
01:38:27.694 --> 01:38:29.112
Well. I...

2287
01:38:29.195 --> 01:38:32.574
I don’t have any comments
to make right now. Cash. I...

2288
01:38:32.657 --> 01:38:35.201
(chuckles) And besides. they’re
here to see you. brother.

2289
01:38:35.285 --> 01:38:37.495
Not here to see me.

2290
01:38:38.997 --> 01:38:41.333
I want you standing with me.

2291
01:38:53.762 --> 01:38:55.430
Very well.

2292
01:38:55.513 --> 01:38:57.307
Uh...

2293
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:59.601
You brothers will excuse us.

2294
01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:07.192
(reporters clamoring)

2295
01:39:07.275 --> 01:39:09.569
CASSIUS: I told you suckers
I was the greatest!

2296
01:39:09.653 --> 01:39:11.154
All of you must bow!

2297
01:39:11.237 --> 01:39:12.822
Oh. I think you guys...

2298
01:39:12.906 --> 01:39:16.242
This is one strange
fucking night.

2299
01:39:18.161 --> 01:39:19.579
Yeah.

2300
01:39:21.206 --> 01:39:23.708
Hey. you know I know what’s
going on out there. right?

2301
01:39:23.792 --> 01:39:25.251
Uh. yeah.

2302
01:39:25.335 --> 01:39:27.504
You know. Cassius. he out there
talking to the press.

2303
01:39:27.587 --> 01:39:29.089
No. I mean out...

2304
01:39:29.172 --> 01:39:31.007
out-out there.

2305
01:39:32.467 --> 01:39:34.469
I mean...

2306
01:39:34.552 --> 01:39:37.180
just ’cause I haven’t released
any records about the movement

2307
01:39:37.263 --> 01:39:40.475
don’t mean I haven’t written
any songs about the movement.

2308
01:39:40.558 --> 01:39:42.268
Come on. man.
Look. you know Malcolm.

2309
01:39:42.352 --> 01:39:44.979
He’s all fire and brimstone
about everything. man.

2310
01:39:45.063 --> 01:39:47.649
But when I heard the
Bob Dylan song. I was mad. man.

2311
01:39:47.732 --> 01:39:49.484
Why?

2312
01:39:50.652 --> 01:39:52.862
’Cause it’s fucking good.

2313
01:39:52.946 --> 01:39:54.614
Well. good.
(chuckles)

2314
01:39:54.698 --> 01:39:55.699
Good.

2315
01:39:55.782 --> 01:39:57.409
You should feel
competitive. man.

2316
01:39:57.492 --> 01:40:00.078
It’s not just ’cause
it was good. It’s...

2317
01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:01.788
I felt like...

2318
01:40:03.289 --> 01:40:05.792
...felt like I should’ve
written that song.

2319
01:40:07.419 --> 01:40:10.630
I mean. I’m-I’m calling myself
"Mr. Soul." and I...

2320
01:40:10.714 --> 01:40:13.216
I haven’t written anything
like that.

2321
01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:18.596
Why don’t you start?

2322
01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:20.306
I started working on something.

2323
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:22.225
Um...

2324
01:40:22.308 --> 01:40:25.562
started working on something
the first day I heard the song.

2325
01:40:26.730 --> 01:40:27.939
Really?

2326
01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:30.984
Yeah. but it’s-it’s...
it’s different.

2327
01:40:31.067 --> 01:40:34.529
And I haven’t even played it
for a crowd yet.

2328
01:40:37.991 --> 01:40:40.285
How does it go?

2329
01:40:41.828 --> 01:40:44.372
All these so-called experts
were all wrong.

2330
01:40:44.456 --> 01:40:47.041
Next time. don’t-don’t ask
no bookies who’s gonna win.

2331
01:40:47.125 --> 01:40:49.544
You come to me.
I’ll tell you who’s gonna win.

2332
01:40:49.627 --> 01:40:51.546
Cassius. uh.
is it fair to assume

2333
01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:53.339
that. since Malcolm X
is standing here with you.

2334
01:40:53.423 --> 01:40:55.884
that you’re seriously
considering becoming a Muslim?

2335
01:40:55.967 --> 01:40:58.762
I’m not considering anything.
I am a Muslim.

2336
01:40:58.845 --> 01:41:01.014
And from this day forward.
I no longer want to be called

2337
01:41:01.097 --> 01:41:03.224
-by the name Cassius Clay.
-REPORTERS: Mm.

2338
01:41:03.308 --> 01:41:04.559
That is a slave name.

2339
01:41:04.642 --> 01:41:05.977
What are we supposed
to call you. then?

2340
01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.813
You will refer to me
as Cassius X.

2341
01:41:08.897 --> 01:41:09.898
-(laughter)
-REPORTER: Malcolm.

2342
01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:11.316
have you been giving Clay
advice

2343
01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:12.776
-on his religious beliefs?
-Look at that.

2344
01:41:12.859 --> 01:41:14.611
MALCOLM:
Well. he’s my brother and...

2345
01:41:14.694 --> 01:41:16.321
New heavyweight champion
of the world.

2346
01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:17.989
MALCOLM:
...my friend.

2347
01:41:18.072 --> 01:41:21.159
I express what I know
and understand. but...

2348
01:41:21.242 --> 01:41:23.244
Cassius.
he has a mind of his own.

2349
01:41:23.328 --> 01:41:25.413
-an understanding of his own.
-Mm-hmm.

2350
01:41:25.497 --> 01:41:26.790
REPORTER 2:
Uh. Cassius. are you gonna

2351
01:41:26.873 --> 01:41:28.082
-give Sonny Liston a rematch?
-Cassius.

2352
01:41:28.166 --> 01:41:30.251
-Cassius. -Cassius.
-Oh. no. man. Come on.

2353
01:41:30.335 --> 01:41:32.128
-Sonny Liston a rematch?
-(chuckles)

2354
01:41:32.212 --> 01:41:34.464
He’s still in the hospital
from after tonight.

2355
01:41:34.547 --> 01:41:35.965
-(laughter. applause)
-Say. man.

2356
01:41:36.049 --> 01:41:37.509
now that this is out the way.

2357
01:41:37.592 --> 01:41:40.178
don’t you think
it’s about time to party?

2358
01:41:40.261 --> 01:41:42.138
-I’d say so.
-Yeah. definitely.

2359
01:41:42.222 --> 01:41:43.223
(cheering)

2360
01:41:43.306 --> 01:41:44.641
CASSIUS:
Man. I’m so fast!

2361
01:41:44.724 --> 01:41:46.434
I’m so fast. after the fight.

2362
01:41:46.518 --> 01:41:48.812
-Miami Vice tried to give me
a speeding ticket! -(cheering)

2363
01:41:48.895 --> 01:41:52.106
If you take Sonny Liston.
Joe Louis

2364
01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:54.651
-and Rocky Marciano...
-(clapping. encouraging chatter)

2365
01:41:54.734 --> 01:41:56.778
I’ll whup ’em all
the same night!

2366
01:41:56.861 --> 01:41:58.530
(cheering)

2367
01:41:58.613 --> 01:42:00.490
That’s what I’ll do next time!

2368
01:42:00.573 --> 01:42:02.283
You know I’m the greatest.

2369
01:42:02.367 --> 01:42:04.494
-OTHERS: Yeah!
-Who’s the greatest?

2370
01:42:04.577 --> 01:42:05.787
-OTHERS: You are!
-That’s right.

2371
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:07.413
Malcolm. come on.
Put that thing down.

2372
01:42:07.497 --> 01:42:09.332
Come over here.
Someone get a picture of us.

2373
01:42:09.415 --> 01:42:10.625
-(assenting. applause)
-Come on.

2374
01:42:10.708 --> 01:42:12.418
I want a picture with Malcolm.
Come on.

2375
01:42:12.502 --> 01:42:14.337
Let’s see. man.

2376
01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:16.381
You know it’s right.
That’s what I’m talking about.

2377
01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:17.507
Give me some. brothers.

2378
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:19.425
That’s it. My brother.

2379
01:42:19.509 --> 01:42:20.927
My main man.

2380
01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:22.095
And you. too.

2381
01:42:22.178 --> 01:42:24.305
I told ’em! I told ’em.

2382
01:42:24.389 --> 01:42:26.266
I proved it. I was in Rome.

2383
01:42:26.349 --> 01:42:27.851
They said they had
a man who could beat me.

2384
01:42:27.934 --> 01:42:29.435
-MAN: Yeah!
-Malcolm. come on.

2385
01:42:29.519 --> 01:42:30.687
Get over here.

2386
01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:32.355
