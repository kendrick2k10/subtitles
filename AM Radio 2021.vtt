3
00:00:13.694 --> 00:00:16.293
- Lies. it's all lies.

4
00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:17.994
You know it's all fake.

5
00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:19.503
but you keep coming back for more.

6
00:00:19.503 --> 00:00:21.939
- Wasn't it Einstein.

7
00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.140
who said-
- (mumbles) Spit it out.

8
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.700
Wasn't it Einstein that said what?

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.867
"Insanity is doing the same
thing over and over again.

10
00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:28.205
but expecting a different result?"

11
00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:29.061
- [Female Caller] Yes. that's it.

12
00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:30.164
- No. that's not it.

13
00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:31.102
Let me tell you something. sweetheart.

14
00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:32.695
that too is a lie.

15
00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:36.224
More lies that you people
all seem to believe nowadays.

16
00:00:36.224 --> 00:00:38.891
No. that quote did not come from Einstein.

17
00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:40.697
even though he's often attributed.

18
00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:43.335
Truth is. no one really
knows who said it first.

19
00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.114
Could be a Chinese proverb.

20
00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:46.774
Could have been Mark Twain.

21
00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:47.755
It doesn't matter.

22
00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:50.420
Truth is. it is a lie.

23
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.124
It is a lie that Einstein said it.

24
00:00:52.124 --> 00:00:54.033
and it is a lie that you are now spreading

25
00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:55.435
like venereal disease.
- Please. just stop.

26
00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:56.909
God. I just didn't know.
- It is that bad.

27
00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.365
You should wanna know the truth.

28
00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:01.314
Instead. you wanna just
keep on believing the lies.

29
00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:02.147
So here's some truth for you.

30
00:01:02.147 --> 00:01:02.980
You ready?

31
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.813
You sittin' down?

32
00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:04.721
Listen.

33
00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:07.011
Nothing will ever change between you

34
00:01:07.011 --> 00:01:09.241
and your lying. cheating.
no good boyfriend.

35
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:10.074
How 'bout that?

36
00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:12.217
(female caller sobs)

37
00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:13.279
Wait.

38
00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:15.301
Are you crying on my show?
- It's just. if you-

39
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:17.724
- Never cry on my show!
- I know-

40
00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:18.615
- Ever!

41
00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:20.816
Crying on my show is not permitted.

42
00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:21.649
Not on my time.

43
00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:22.482
Never.

44
00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.074
- But Taz-
- But nothing!

45
00:01:24.074 --> 00:01:25.591
Now. if you want me to play you a song.

46
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:28.148
you want me listen to your
little problems. fine.

47
00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:29.544
But you cry. I disconnect you.

48
00:01:29.544 --> 00:01:30.502
Bye-bye.
- Wait!

49
00:01:30.502 --> 00:01:32.643
- Wait for death.
(button clicks)

50
00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:33.515
Why do you do it. people?

51
00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:36.104
Why do you insist on believing the lies?

52
00:01:36.104 --> 00:01:38.503
In this day and age of
Insta Face Twita Snap.

53
00:01:38.503 --> 00:01:39.816
everything is fake.

54
00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:42.614
You need to feel something that is real.

55
00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:43.662
So this next song.

56
00:01:43.662 --> 00:01:46.252
dedicated to all you freaks.
geeks. and losers out there.

57
00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:47.085
Enjoy.

58
00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:50.085
(mellow jazz music)

59
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.573
(lighter flicks and thuds)

60
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:03.417
- Stop insulting and
hanging up on the callers.

61
00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:05.797
Our ratings are already in the tank.

62
00:02:05.797 --> 00:02:07.205
Put that thing out!

63
00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:08.746
- What do you expect?

64
00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:10.691
People can stream any
song anytime they want.

65
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:12.493
Why would anybody listen to AM radio?

66
00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:15.358
- Look. just don't insult the caller.

67
00:02:15.358 --> 00:02:16.481
- Look. that's what they get

68
00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:17.468
for calling at this hour.

69
00:02:17.468 --> 00:02:19.358
requesting a bunch of dumb ass song.

70
00:02:19.358 --> 00:02:20.838
- Play the damn music.

71
00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:22.126
- You forget who you're talking to.

72
00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:24.957
I'm DJ Taz the Maz. the master.

73
00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:28.624
- Okay. just play the
damn music. okay. Taz?

74
00:02:30.272 --> 00:02:31.389
Taz!

75
00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.889
(mellow jazz music continues playing)

76
00:03:01.693 --> 00:03:04.111
- Now that was a good song.

77
00:03:04.111 --> 00:03:05.691
It had everything.

78
00:03:05.691 --> 00:03:09.800
It had loneliness. sorrow.
despair. real emotions.

79
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.711
not that manufactured. autotuned.
fake music industry crap.

80
00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:15.609
Hope you enjoy.

81
00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.488
Tony. we got another caller?

82
00:03:18.488 --> 00:03:19.637
No callers?

83
00:03:19.637 --> 00:03:20.786
Seriously?

84
00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:22.981
(laughs) Come on. people!

85
00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:24.565
I'm in the mood for one of
your calls right about now.

86
00:03:24.565 --> 00:03:25.582
Come on. let's do it.

87
00:03:25.582 --> 00:03:27.056
See. this job.

88
00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:28.482
it's kinda like Russian roulette.

89
00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:29.389
You know why. Tony?

90
00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:31.072
Because you push that button.

91
00:03:31.072 --> 00:03:32.712
you never know what's gonna happen.

92
00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:35.182
Come on. give me your best shot.

93
00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:36.582
Oh. looks like we got one.

94
00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:37.506
(button clicks)

95
00:03:37.506 --> 00:03:38.723
(button softly slides)

96
00:03:38.723 --> 00:03:39.603
You're on the air.

97
00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:40.591
- [Peter] I'm Peter.

98
00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:41.825
Hey.

99
00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:42.658
- Hey.

100
00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:43.611
How are you doin'. Peter?

101
00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:44.524
- [Peter] Hello?

102
00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:45.543
- You're on the air.

103
00:03:45.543 --> 00:03:47.195
- [Peter] Oh-oh. hey. Taz.

104
00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:48.516
The Taz Man!

105
00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:50.451
Taz the man.
- Live and in the flesh.

106
00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:51.566
(Peter laughs)

107
00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.287
- [Peter] You are crazy. man.

108
00:03:53.287 --> 00:03:54.213
- We're all a little crazy.

109
00:03:54.213 --> 00:03:55.525
The world's crazy. isn't it?

110
00:03:55.525 --> 00:03:57.127
- [Peter] Yeah. man.

111
00:03:57.127 --> 00:03:59.374
- So what's your poison?

112
00:03:59.374 --> 00:04:00.903
- [Peter] What?

113
00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:02.967
- You know. we all have a poison.

114
00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:05.431
dope. smoke. meth. pills.

115
00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:06.447
What you got?

116
00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:07.344
- [Peter] I'm clean.

117
00:04:07.344 --> 00:04:08.177
Man. I...

118
00:04:08.177 --> 00:04:09.989
(Peter coughs)

119
00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:10.822
I swear.
(Taz scoffs)

120
00:04:10.822 --> 00:04:11.655
- Sure.

121
00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:12.709
Scouts honor?

122
00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:13.542
- [Peter] What?

123
00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:14.375
- Oh. that's right.

124
00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:16.560
you don't have a Boy Scouts
out here in Nashville. do you?

125
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.000
- [Peter] Boy Scouts?

126
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.704
- Hey. you know. "Always be prepared"?

127
00:04:20.704 --> 00:04:22.103
Boy Scouts?

128
00:04:22.103 --> 00:04:24.206
- Oh. that's gay. man.
- Well. you might have

129
00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:25.775
a point there.

130
00:04:25.775 --> 00:04:27.371
According to news reports.

131
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.614
over 12.000 individuals may
have been abused as a Boy Scout.

132
00:04:31.614 --> 00:04:32.893
- [Peter] Oh. those faggots.

133
00:04:32.893 --> 00:04:34.476
- Well. see. but that's just the point.

134
00:04:34.476 --> 00:04:36.172
Boy Scouts have had a long tradition

135
00:04:36.172 --> 00:04:39.085
of denying openly gay individuals.

136
00:04:39.085 --> 00:04:40.098
- [Peter] Good.

137
00:04:40.098 --> 00:04:41.933
- Yeah. but they're all
a bunch of hypocrites.

138
00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:44.412
'cause even though they
deny those gay individuals.

139
00:04:44.412 --> 00:04:46.475
sexual abuse still runs rampant.

140
00:04:46.475 --> 00:04:47.933
Now. how can you explain that?

141
00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:49.227
- [Peter] Look. man.

142
00:04:49.227 --> 00:04:50.887
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

143
00:04:50.887 --> 00:04:52.212
- Yeah. I'm sure you don't.

144
00:04:52.212 --> 00:04:54.527
- [Peter] Hey. could you play a song. man?

145
00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:55.360
- Yeah. sure.

146
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.295
What do you wanna hear?

147
00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:59.856
- [Peter] "Discrete Love"
from that babe. Antoinette.

148
00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:00.916
- Yeah. we don't have that one.

149
00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:01.888
- [Peter] You're crazy.

150
00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:03.766
It's everywhere. man.

151
00:05:03.766 --> 00:05:04.852
My jam now.

152
00:05:04.852 --> 00:05:05.705
Me and my girl love it.

153
00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.292
- It's your jam. yeah?

154
00:05:07.292 --> 00:05:08.373
Your girl?

155
00:05:08.373 --> 00:05:09.336
(Taz scoffs)
- Yeah. man.

156
00:05:09.336 --> 00:05:10.169
We love that song.

157
00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.482
- Yeah. well. we don't have that here.

158
00:05:11.482 --> 00:05:14.002
- [Peter] It plays on
your station all the time.

159
00:05:14.002 --> 00:05:15.476
- Not on my time.

160
00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:17.370
Now listen up. all you morons out there.

161
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.077
I do not play that crap on my show.

162
00:05:20.077 --> 00:05:23.032
I play real music by real musicians.

163
00:05:23.032 --> 00:05:25.072
not fake. talentless pop stars

164
00:05:25.072 --> 00:05:27.606
who flaunt their ass and
tits just to get popular.

165
00:05:27.606 --> 00:05:28.512
(taps on glass)
- Man!

166
00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:29.962
What got up your ass?

167
00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:30.883
- The truth. Peter.

168
00:05:30.883 --> 00:05:33.289
The truth shall set you free.

169
00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.682
Now those fake ass. talentless
pop stars. like Antoinette.

170
00:05:36.682 --> 00:05:38.482
(laughs) they're not even real.

171
00:05:38.482 --> 00:05:40.026
She's not a real artist.

172
00:05:40.026 --> 00:05:41.364
She doesn't write her own lyrics.

173
00:05:41.364 --> 00:05:43.364
she doesn't play an instrument.
and she can barely sing.

174
00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:45.289
All she does is flaunt her body.

175
00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.593
- [Peter] Well. she does have a nice body.

176
00:05:47.593 --> 00:05:50.193
- Well. then let that airhead
go model for Victoria Secret.

177
00:05:50.193 --> 00:05:52.271
'cause she gets no play on my show.

178
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:54.889
I play real music. real songs.

179
00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.386
- [Peter] That shit you
play now is no good.

180
00:05:57.386 --> 00:05:59.082
My girl and I wanna hear "Discreet Love".

181
00:05:59.082 --> 00:06:00.033
- Or what?

182
00:06:00.033 --> 00:06:01.169
Your girl won't put out

183
00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.569
if she doesn't hear that song. is that it?

184
00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.166
- [Peter] Shut up and
play the fuckin' song!

185
00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:05.002
- Well. let me tell you something.

186
00:06:05.002 --> 00:06:06.926
If you need that song to
make your relationship work.

187
00:06:06.926 --> 00:06:08.357
then your relationship is fucked.

188
00:06:08.357 --> 00:06:10.577
But your relationship is
fucked already. isn't it?

189
00:06:10.577 --> 00:06:11.800
You know why?

190
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.594
Because love does not exist.

191
00:06:13.594 --> 00:06:14.550
It's all a lie.

192
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.000
Flowers. and candy. and hearts.

193
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.402
and naked boys shootin' arrows.

194
00:06:17.402 --> 00:06:20.075
it's all a lie made up to sell you shit.

195
00:06:20.075 --> 00:06:22.162
Love is just capitalism at its finest.

196
00:06:22.162 --> 00:06:23.797
- [Peter] Man. fuck you!

197
00:06:23.797 --> 00:06:24.690
- No. fuck you.

198
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.461
because I am not the one who's fucked.

199
00:06:26.461 --> 00:06:27.294
I'm woke.

200
00:06:29.378 --> 00:06:30.211
You know what. people?

201
00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:31.044
You kill me.

202
00:06:31.044 --> 00:06:31.877
(Taz chuckles)

203
00:06:31.877 --> 00:06:34.823
You are still swallowing this love crap!

204
00:06:34.823 --> 00:06:35.825
Are you serious?

205
00:06:35.825 --> 00:06:37.665
You're get into these fake relationships.

206
00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:39.707
You make up these fake
stories about a happy ending

207
00:06:39.707 --> 00:06:41.780
that is not going to happen.

208
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.276
(gentle instrumental music)
It's all fake.

209
00:06:43.276 --> 00:06:45.545
You hear nothing but
talk of fake news today.

210
00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:47.089
You know what fake news is?

211
00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:49.603
Wedding notices. engagement announcements.

212
00:06:49.603 --> 00:06:52.581
relationship statuses.
that's all fake. people.

213
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:54.360
The Beatles were wrong.

214
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.385
Dead wrong.

215
00:06:55.385 --> 00:06:58.290
Life is just a parade of meaningless sex

216
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.684
and violence on the way to the cemetery.

217
00:07:00.684 --> 00:07:02.130
But don't get too depressed.

218
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.352
because there is music to
accompany you along the way.

219
00:07:05.352 --> 00:07:07.367
so relax and sing along.

220
00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:10.450
(mellow jazz music)

221
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.690
- I told you. you can't
talk to everyone like that!

222
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.847
And cussing over the air?

223
00:07:19.847 --> 00:07:23.341
You are going to get our
license revoked by the FCC.

224
00:07:23.341 --> 00:07:25.553
- Hey. when are we gonna get
some decent food in here. huh?

225
00:07:25.553 --> 00:07:27.368
This pizza tastes like vomit.

226
00:07:27.368 --> 00:07:28.810
- They sponsor us.

227
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.188
And that's not the point. Ese.

228
00:07:30.188 --> 00:07:31.021
- Oh. they sponsor us?

229
00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:31.854
Okay.

230
00:07:31.854 --> 00:07:32.687
It still tastes like ass.

231
00:07:32.687 --> 00:07:34.502
- Listen. you fucking better calm.

232
00:07:34.502 --> 00:07:35.686
The only reason

233
00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:38.199
why I haven't kicked your
ass out of this station

234
00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.807
is because people out there

235
00:07:40.807 --> 00:07:42.487
still adore you.

236
00:07:42.487 --> 00:07:44.028
So either you please them.

237
00:07:44.028 --> 00:07:45.638
or we go to the shitter!

238
00:07:45.638 --> 00:07:46.471
- Hey. guess what?

239
00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:47.914
We live in the shitter.

240
00:07:47.914 --> 00:07:50.050
- I'm gonna give you one last chance

241
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.687
to just play the damn records.

242
00:07:52.687 --> 00:07:54.816
I don't care if it's Antoinette.

243
00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:57.426
I don't care if it's Boy George!

244
00:07:57.426 --> 00:07:59.820
Just play the damn music!

245
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.701
- My contract stipulates

246
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:03.741
that I have the right to
choose my own repertoire.

247
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:07.291
I am not gonna sacrifice my
artistic integrity. okay?

248
00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:09.419
(Tony speaks in Spanish)

249
00:08:09.419 --> 00:08:12.661
- This isn't about integrity or art.

250
00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:14.621
Radio is dying.

251
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:19.105
They have YouTube. Spotify.
iTunes. and all that.

252
00:08:19.105 --> 00:08:23.499
So if you don't want
to play the hits. fine.

253
00:08:23.499 --> 00:08:24.999
then talk to them.

254
00:08:25.852 --> 00:08:28.053
Do some sort of talk show or something.

255
00:08:28.053 --> 00:08:29.440
I don't give a shit.

256
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.381
- I'm a DJ.

257
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:32.135
not a motivational speaker. all right?

258
00:08:32.135 --> 00:08:33.621
And cut the Spanish. Ese.

259
00:08:33.621 --> 00:08:34.455
You're white.

260
00:08:34.455 --> 00:08:37.210
- I'm your boss and I'm Cuban. okay?

261
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.962
So just play the damn music.

262
00:08:39.962 --> 00:08:42.309
(pizza box rustles)
Give me this pizza.

263
00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.339
- Take the fucking pizza.

264
00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:45.639
Bald son of a bitch.

265
00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:48.556
(mellow jazz music continues)

266
00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:50.391
(keys rattling)

267
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:53.900
(car door clatters open)

268
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.838
(car creaks)
(door slams shut)

269
00:08:54.838 --> 00:08:59.608
(engine turns over and strains)

270
00:08:59.608 --> 00:09:02.441
(engine sputters)

271
00:09:04.092 --> 00:09:06.916
(thuds dashboard)

272
00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:09.917
(car door clatters open)

273
00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:11.151
(door slams shut)

274
00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:12.815
(footsteps pattering)

275
00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:16.898
(melancholic instrumental music)

276
00:09:25.634 --> 00:09:26.467
(door slams shut)

277
00:09:26.467 --> 00:09:27.777
(plaque shuffles and thuds)

278
00:09:27.777 --> 00:09:32.694
(melancholic instrumental music continues)

279
00:09:49.331 --> 00:09:51.978
(Taz sighs)

280
00:09:51.978 --> 00:09:54.785
(exhales loudly)

281
00:09:54.785 --> 00:09:58.407
Okay. I'm putting you on
the air in five seconds.

282
00:09:58.407 --> 00:09:59.275
Okay. welcome back.

283
00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:00.813
This is your DJ. Taz the Maz.

284
00:10:00.813 --> 00:10:02.094
and we have Adam on the line.

285
00:10:02.094 --> 00:10:03.322
Adam. where you callin' from?

286
00:10:03.322 --> 00:10:04.323
- [Adam] Glenn Cliff.

287
00:10:04.323 --> 00:10:05.162
- Glenn Cliff.

288
00:10:05.162 --> 00:10:07.063
I know you got all the
pretty women out there. huh?

289
00:10:07.063 --> 00:10:08.122
- [Adam] Nah. they all suck.

290
00:10:08.122 --> 00:10:09.254
(Taz laughs)

291
00:10:09.254 --> 00:10:11.652
- So Adam. who's your favorite artist?

292
00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:12.685
- [Adam] I love TOP.

293
00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:14.252
Can you play "Shake It Out" for me?

294
00:10:14.252 --> 00:10:15.085
- Sure.

295
00:10:15.085 --> 00:10:16.351
But first. answer me this.

296
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:18.551
Do you think that if
you flew over Antarctica

297
00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:19.971
you would reach the end of the earth?

298
00:10:19.971 --> 00:10:20.804
- [Adam] What?

299
00:10:20.804 --> 00:10:23.441
- Yeah. if you took a plane
to the end of the world.

300
00:10:23.441 --> 00:10:25.363
you think there'd be an edge or a limit?

301
00:10:25.363 --> 00:10:26.196
- [Adam] I don't know. Taz.

302
00:10:26.196 --> 00:10:27.482
I ain't never thought about that.

303
00:10:27.482 --> 00:10:28.643
- Well. you should think about this.

304
00:10:28.643 --> 00:10:29.651
Did you go to school?

305
00:10:29.651 --> 00:10:30.484
- [Adam] Yeah. but what does that

306
00:10:30.484 --> 00:10:32.069
have to do with music. anyway?

307
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.960
- Everything.

308
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.881
Did you know that your
favorite artist. TOP.

309
00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:37.001
is raising funds for a trip to Antarctica

310
00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:39.240
so that he can prove
that the Earth is flat?

311
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.711
- [Adam] I didn't know.

312
00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:41.701
- Well. now you know.

313
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:42.687
So do me a favor.

314
00:10:42.687 --> 00:10:44.720
Call me back after your trip
to the end of the world.

315
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.116
Let me know how it went.

316
00:10:46.116 --> 00:10:47.718
(scoffs) Flat Earth.

317
00:10:47.718 --> 00:10:49.246
Can you believe that. people?

318
00:10:49.246 --> 00:10:52.380
Copernicus discovered that the
Earth was round in the 1500s.

319
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.727
TOP. you're 500 years too late.

320
00:10:54.727 --> 00:10:56.591
Feel like we're going
backwards as a species.

321
00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:58.133
Okay. got another caller.

322
00:10:58.133 --> 00:10:59.029
Who's on the line?

323
00:10:59.029 --> 00:10:59.888
- [Cynthia] Cynthia.

324
00:10:59.888 --> 00:11:02.283
Been a fan of yours since the FM days.

325
00:11:02.283 --> 00:11:03.569
- Thank you. Cynthia.

326
00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:06.053
So Cynthia. do you believe
that the Earth is flat?

327
00:11:06.053 --> 00:11:08.416
- (giggles) No. Taz.
- Good.

328
00:11:08.416 --> 00:11:10.329
So who's your favorite artist?

329
00:11:10.329 --> 00:11:12.370
Actually. I'll make it simple for you.

330
00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.126
What is your favorite music genre?

331
00:11:14.126 --> 00:11:16.245
- [Cynthia] Hmm. maybe the blues?

332
00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:17.580
- Mmm. nice.

333
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.100
Do you know what the blues
were called in the beginning?

334
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:20.933
- [Cynthia] No.

335
00:11:20.933 --> 00:11:22.880
- They called them race records.

336
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.191
In the 1920s to the 1940s.

337
00:11:25.191 --> 00:11:27.614
race records were only
sold for black people.

338
00:11:27.614 --> 00:11:28.607
What do you think of that?

339
00:11:28.607 --> 00:11:30.680
- [Cynthia] Wow. that's terrible. Taz.

340
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.390
- That is racist country that we live in.

341
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.849
Racism still exists to this day.

342
00:11:35.849 --> 00:11:37.706
Do you know that the cops
killed another black man

343
00:11:37.706 --> 00:11:39.714
while he was trying to
get into his own car?

344
00:11:39.714 --> 00:11:41.378
- [Cynthia] Right. that's messed up.

345
00:11:41.378 --> 00:11:43.441
- It's messed up indeed.

346
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:44.669
Thank you for callin'.

347
00:11:44.669 --> 00:11:47.112
Here's a little old school blues for you.

348
00:11:47.112 --> 00:11:52.112

That's it for the Taz Man.

That little rant you did the other day

422
00:15:57.144 --> 00:15:58.825
got us fined by the FCC.

423
00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:00.976

424
00:16:00.976 --> 00:16:02.535
- Great. no more pizza.

425
00:16:02.535 --> 00:16:04.395
Maybe you can get some decent
food in here for a change.

426
00:16:04.395 --> 00:16:05.395
and probably get fat.

427
00:16:05.395 --> 00:16:07.454

Everybody knows I was just playin'.

432
00:16:15.486 --> 00:16:16.345

433
00:16:16.345 --> 00:16:19.663
no one knows. 'cause no one's listening.

434
00:16:19.663 --> 00:16:20.496
Okay?

435
00:16:20.496 --> 00:16:23.195
So listen. from today forward.

436
00:16:23.195 --> 00:16:24.826
the format changes.

437
00:16:24.826 --> 00:16:25.987
It's no more music.

438
00:16:25.987 --> 00:16:29.423
Now. it's just a talk show about music.

439
00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:30.716
- Okay. let me get this straight.

440
00:16:30.716 --> 00:16:33.883
A talk show about music without music?

441
00:16:35.723 --> 00:16:38.497
Who the hell is gonna listen to that?

442
00:16:38.497 --> 00:16:41.547
- Thanks to you. that's all we got.

443
00:16:41.547 --> 00:16:42.813
You're on in 10 minutes.

444

We are under new management.

451
00:16:56.547 --> 00:16:58.717

is about to break loose.

00:17:07.046 --> 00:17:08.852
You ready for this?

459
00:17:08.852 --> 00:17:10.497
Give it your best shot.

460
00:17:10.497 --> 00:17:11.818
You're on the air.

461
00:17:11.818 --> 00:17:12.651

Thanks for callin'.

468
00:17:19.518 --> 00:17:21.021
- [Earl] Yeah. I wanna hear that song.

469
00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:22.839
what's it called?
- Wait a minute.

470
00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.332
(chuckles) Earl. let me
stop you right there.

471
00:17:24.332 --> 00:17:26.497
Maybe I was being a little too vague.

472
00:17:26.497 --> 00:17:28.430
There are no more songs.

473
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.912
This program will no
longer play any music.

474
00:17:30.912 --> 00:17:34.040
whether you request it or
whether I recommend it.

475
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.864
No hay orquesta.

476
00:17:35.864 --> 00:17:37.593
No hay banda.

477
00:17:37.593 --> 00:17:39.426
No orchestra. no band.

478
00:17:40.357 --> 00:17:42.582
We knew we were outta luck
the day the music died.

479
00:17:42.582 --> 00:17:44.269
Bye-bye. Miss American Pie.

480
00:17:44.269 --> 00:17:45.932
- [Earl] What the hell are you saying?

481
00:17:45.932 --> 00:17:49.620
I wanna hear "No Shoes.
No Shirt. No Problem".

482
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.778
- Would that be an accurate
description of you. Earl?

483
00:17:51.778 --> 00:17:52.632
- [Earl] What?

484
00:17:52.632 --> 00:17:54.710
- No shoes. no shirt. no service?

485
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.070
- [Earl] What the hell
are you saying. boy?

486
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.291
- Who are you calling boy?

487
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:00.233
- [Earl] Oh. you're one of those?

488
00:18:00.233 --> 00:18:01.321
- One of what?

489
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:02.154
- [Earl] You know.

490
00:18:02.154 --> 00:18:03.112
- No I don't know. Earl.

491
00:18:03.112 --> 00:18:04.314
Please enlighten me.

492
00:18:04.314 --> 00:18:06.075
- [Earl] You're usin' big words. boy.

493
00:18:06.075 --> 00:18:08.516
- Oh. I'm sorry that my words
are to big for you. Earl.

494
00:18:08.516 --> 00:18:10.592
See. some of us boys. we went to school.

495
00:18:10.592 --> 00:18:12.835
that's actual school.
not cow tippin' school.

496
00:18:12.835 --> 00:18:13.826
- [Earl] You son of a bitch!

497
00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:16.508
- Tell me if this sounds like
a phone hangin' up. homeboy?

498
00:18:16.508 --> 00:18:17.788
(Taz scoffs)

499
00:18:17.788 --> 00:18:19.385
Nicely played. 'Merica.

500
00:18:19.385 --> 00:18:20.218
Nice.

501
00:18:21.146 --> 00:18:22.844
So this is it. huh. folks?

502
00:18:22.844 --> 00:18:25.096
This is what it's come down to?

503
00:18:25.096 --> 00:18:27.671
The fall of the empire is upon us.

504
00:18:27.671 --> 00:18:29.540
and it's all your fault.

505
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.386
You screwed it up.

506
00:18:31.386 --> 00:18:35.746
Too much fast food. too
much TV. too much booze.

507
00:18:35.746 --> 00:18:38.044
too much drugs. too many
bullets. too many guns!

508
00:18:38.044 --> 00:18:41.044
(knocking on glass)

509
00:18:41.895 --> 00:18:44.343
Just (scoffs) what happened. people?

510
00:18:44.343 --> 00:18:45.936
Greatness was within our grasp.

511
00:18:45.936 --> 00:18:48.165
and you let it slip away.

512
00:18:48.165 --> 00:18:49.788
How many of you are still listening?

513
00:18:49.788 --> 00:18:52.235
I mean. really listenin' out there?

514
00:18:52.235 --> 00:18:54.216
I don't even blame the ones that bail.

515
00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:55.049
(scoffs) You know why?

516
00:18:55.049 --> 00:18:56.324
'Cause we're all shit.

517
00:18:56.324 --> 00:18:57.157
Everything.

518
00:18:57.157 --> 00:18:58.625
I'm shit. you're shit.

519
00:18:58.625 --> 00:18:59.458
and there's nothin' that can be

520
00:18:59.458 --> 00:19:01.022
done about it.
(thumping on glass)

521
00:19:01.022 --> 00:19:05.223
(ominous dramatic music)
(feet shuffling)

522
00:19:05.223 --> 00:19:08.152
- We'll be right back after this.

523
00:19:08.152 --> 00:19:10.041
What the hell was that?

524
00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:11.733
We just had this conversation.

525
00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:14.273
- That guy was a racist asshole.

526
00:19:14.273 --> 00:19:16.664
- [Tony] The whole world is full of 'em.

527
00:19:16.664 --> 00:19:18.293
You still have to do your job.

528
00:19:18.293 --> 00:19:19.573
- All right. fine.

529
00:19:19.573 --> 00:19:22.073
- Where are you going?

530
00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:25.261
If you leave now. don't come back.

531
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:26.791
And then where will you eat?

532
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:29.382
Oh. I know. I know. nowhere.

533
00:19:29.382 --> 00:19:30.715
You are nowhere.

534
00:19:31.801 --> 00:19:33.394
- I'll figure somethin' out.

535
00:19:33.394 --> 00:19:34.713
Always have.

536
00:19:34.713 --> 00:19:35.582
- If you could've.

537
00:19:35.582 --> 00:19:37.948
you would've a long time ago.

538
00:19:37.948 --> 00:19:39.893
You've always been an asshole.

539
00:19:39.893 --> 00:19:41.664
even before her.

540
00:19:41.664 --> 00:19:44.093
The only difference now
is. that without her.

541
00:19:44.093 --> 00:19:47.384
people don't wanna put up with it.

542
00:19:47.384 --> 00:19:49.217
I'm the only one left.

543
00:19:50.493 --> 00:19:53.326
If you leave this station tonight.

544
00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:56.782
it's over. friend.

545
00:19:56.782 --> 00:19:57.615
Hmm. yeah.

546
00:19:59.142 --> 00:20:01.154
These commercials are two minutes.

547
00:20:01.154 --> 00:20:02.611
Make a decision.

548
00:20:02.611 --> 00:20:03.694
I don't care.

549
00:20:04.733 --> 00:20:09.733
(ominous dramatic music)
(door slams shut)

550
00:20:09.795 --> 00:20:11.891
- [Voice Of Taz Over
Radio] AM Up All Night.

551
00:20:11.891 --> 00:20:14.234
And we are gonna be up
all night and all morning.

552
00:20:14.234 --> 00:20:16.211
so stay tuned.
(door slams shut)

553
00:20:16.211 --> 00:20:19.878
(gentle instrumental music)

554
00:20:21.628 --> 00:20:25.461
(sirens wail in the distance)

555
00:20:32.749 --> 00:20:35.668
(knocking at door)

556
00:20:35.668 --> 00:20:37.785
(buzzer sounds)
(alarm clicks)

557
00:20:37.785 --> 00:20:40.702
(door creaks open)

558
00:20:42.177 --> 00:20:45.010
(door slams shut)

559
00:20:46.214 --> 00:20:47.881
- You're in my seat.

560
00:20:51.046 --> 00:20:52.445
- You good?
- I'm good.

561
00:20:52.445 --> 00:20:54.175
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

562
00:20:54.175 --> 00:20:56.008
Don't you even try it.

563
00:20:59.525 --> 00:21:00.367
Welcome back. everybody.

564
00:21:00.367 --> 00:21:02.884
This is DJ Taz the Maz.

565
00:21:02.884 --> 00:21:04.414
Now. let me start off by saying.

566
00:21:04.414 --> 00:21:05.247
I'm sorry for going

567
00:21:05.247 --> 00:21:07.670
a little to Alex Jones on y'all (laughs).

568
00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:08.808
I'm not as bad as that fool.

569
00:21:08.808 --> 00:21:09.642
but come on. people.

570
00:21:09.642 --> 00:21:11.693
you gotta meet me halfway.

571
00:21:11.693 --> 00:21:13.382
Now. like I said earlier.

572
00:21:13.382 --> 00:21:14.607
we're not playing music anymore.

573
00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:16.714
so it's just me.

574
00:21:16.714 --> 00:21:21.074
I've gotta prove to my bosses
that I'm worth my paycheck.

575
00:21:21.074 --> 00:21:23.974
How many of you out there
have to do that. huh?

576
00:21:23.974 --> 00:21:25.132
Probably all of you.

577
00:21:25.132 --> 00:21:26.521
all of you that are listening right now.

578
00:21:26.521 --> 00:21:30.424
if there's anybody out
there still listening.

579
00:21:30.424 --> 00:21:32.007
But I know you are.

580
00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:35.232
I can feel you.

581
00:21:35.232 --> 00:21:37.773
I can feel you out there breathing.

582
00:21:37.773 --> 00:21:41.023
drivin'. drinking coffee. up all night.

583
00:21:42.742 --> 00:21:44.074
The miracle runs 24 hours.

584
00:21:44.074 --> 00:21:46.016
but it don't run on Dunkin.

585
00:21:46.016 --> 00:21:47.494
It runs on us.

586
00:21:47.494 --> 00:21:49.827
real people like you and me.

587
00:21:51.194 --> 00:21:52.585
Come on. I know there's somebody out

588
00:21:52.585 --> 00:21:55.467
who understands what I'm talkin' about.

589
00:21:55.467 --> 00:21:56.300
Hmm?

590
00:21:57.537 --> 00:22:00.346
(chuckles) Hell. who am I kiddin'?

591
00:22:00.346 --> 00:22:01.284
This is it. you know?

592
00:22:01.284 --> 00:22:02.201
This is it.

593
00:22:03.254 --> 00:22:06.261
There are no guarantees in life.

594
00:22:06.261 --> 00:22:08.125
One minute you're happy.

595
00:22:08.125 --> 00:22:09.086
You got it all.

596
00:22:09.086 --> 00:22:10.397
Everything you ever asked for.

597
00:22:10.397 --> 00:22:12.397
and then bam. it's gone.

598
00:22:13.695 --> 00:22:15.924
Just have to accept it.

599
00:22:15.924 --> 00:22:19.775
(gentle instrumental music continues)

600
00:22:19.775 --> 00:22:21.114
You're on the air.

601
00:22:21.114 --> 00:22:22.536
- [Lucy] Hello. Taz.

602
00:22:22.536 --> 00:22:23.598
- Hello.

603
00:22:23.598 --> 00:22:24.466
Who am I speaking to?

604
00:22:24.466 --> 00:22:26.716
- [Lucy] Just call me Lucy.

605
00:22:27.804 --> 00:22:28.637
- How you doin'. Lucy?

606
00:22:28.637 --> 00:22:30.404
Thank you for callin'.

607
00:22:30.404 --> 00:22:32.036
So what's on your mind?

608
00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:33.525
- [Lucy] I understand.

609
00:22:33.525 --> 00:22:34.805
- What's that?

610
00:22:34.805 --> 00:22:37.484
- [Lucy] What you were
saying. I understand.

611
00:22:37.484 --> 00:22:38.717
- I was saying a lot.

612
00:22:38.717 --> 00:22:40.044
- [Lucy] And nothing at all.

613
00:22:40.044 --> 00:22:40.975
(both laughing)

614
00:22:40.975 --> 00:22:42.804
- Yeah. I tend to do that sometimes.

615
00:22:42.804 --> 00:22:45.265
- [Lucy] No. but you were
actually saying something.

616
00:22:45.265 --> 00:22:48.606
about how this country
runs on people like us.

617
00:22:48.606 --> 00:22:50.116
- What. night owls?

618
00:22:50.116 --> 00:22:52.425
- [Lucy] No. people
fighting for their lives.

619
00:22:52.425 --> 00:22:56.155
just scroungin' those
dollars just to stay afloat.

620
00:22:56.155 --> 00:22:56.988
- That's who I am?

621
00:22:56.988 --> 00:22:59.061
- [Lucy] It's been sounding like that

622
00:22:59.061 --> 00:23:00.452
the past couple months.

623
00:23:00.452 --> 00:23:01.292
- That bad. huh?

624
00:23:01.292 --> 00:23:02.711
- [Lucy] There's no shame in it.

625
00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:04.522
No shame in being poor.

626
00:23:04.522 --> 00:23:06.423
- No. no shame.

627
00:23:06.423 --> 00:23:07.924
No great honor either.

628
00:23:07.924 --> 00:23:09.573
- [Lucy] Ah. Hitler.

629
00:23:09.573 --> 00:23:10.406
(Taz laughs)

630
00:23:10.406 --> 00:23:11.489
- Well done. Lucy.

631
00:23:11.489 --> 00:23:13.152
- [Lucy] I have my moments.

632
00:23:13.152 --> 00:23:14.402
- I bet you do.

633
00:23:15.404 --> 00:23:16.483
I used to have moments.

634
00:23:16.483 --> 00:23:19.891
- [Lucy] You still have
them from time to time.

635
00:23:19.891 --> 00:23:21.221
- Well. thank you.

636
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:22.948
- [Lucy] That's why I followed you here

637
00:23:22.948 --> 00:23:25.450
all the way from your glory days at FM.

638
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.222
- Ah. yes. my glory days at FM.

639
00:23:28.222 --> 00:23:29.850
Fame and fortune.

640
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.069
- [Lucy] Yeah. but were you happy then?

641
00:23:33.069 --> 00:23:34.899
- I don't know.

642
00:23:34.899 --> 00:23:36.543
but I was winning.

643
00:23:36.543 --> 00:23:37.510
- [Lucy] Do you feel like

644
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:39.818
life's a game with winners and losers.

645
00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:42.738
and do you think you're losing now?

646
00:23:42.738 --> 00:23:44.049
- Feels like that at times.

647
00:23:44.049 --> 00:23:46.856
- [Lucy] Yeah. well. we all
feel like that at times.

648
00:23:46.856 --> 00:23:49.102
- Are you winning in
the game of life. Lucy?

649
00:23:49.102 --> 00:23:50.588
- [Lucy] Let's see.

650
00:23:50.588 --> 00:23:54.170
I'm broke. tired. and
bored out of my mind.

651
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.100
but my bills are paid.

652
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.639
I've got a bed to sleep in.

653
00:23:57.639 --> 00:24:00.226
and I'm sitting here talkin' to you.

654
00:24:00.226 --> 00:24:02.558
Since I'm a glass half full kind of gal.

655
00:24:02.558 --> 00:24:05.299
I'll say. yes. I feel like I'm winning.

656
00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:06.790
- So Lucy. what do you do?

657
00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.269
- [Lucy] Let's just say. I help people.

658
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:11.092
just like you do.

659
00:24:11.092 --> 00:24:11.925
- Like me?

660
00:24:11.925 --> 00:24:13.820
(chuckles) Me. help people?

661
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.149
- [Lucy] Yeah. listening to you

662
00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:17.655
helps me not kill myself out of boredom

663
00:24:17.655 --> 00:24:19.948
at two o'clock in the morning.

664
00:24:19.948 --> 00:24:22.119
- Well. do you like helping people?

665
00:24:22.119 --> 00:24:24.729
- [Lucy] Helping people
is all I have left.

666
00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:28.298
- I can see helping people
losing its charm real fast.

667
00:24:28.298 --> 00:24:31.041
- [Lucy] Well. there's no
better exercise for the soul

668
00:24:31.041 --> 00:24:34.452
than reaching down and pulling people up.

669
00:24:34.452 --> 00:24:36.588
- Wow. that's deep.

670
00:24:36.588 --> 00:24:38.091
Care to elaborate?

671
00:24:38.091 --> 00:24:39.650
- [Lucy] All I know is.

672
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.619
when people are broke down. left stranded.

673
00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:44.468
just in a bad place.

674
00:24:44.468 --> 00:24:46.489
there's no better feeling
than being the one

675
00:24:46.489 --> 00:24:47.960
who gets them back on track.

676
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.171
you know. to continue their journey.

677
00:24:50.171 --> 00:24:51.869
- Lucy. thank you.

678
00:24:51.869 --> 00:24:54.389
Thank you for helping
me get back on the road.

679
00:24:54.389 --> 00:24:55.538
- [Lucy] What are you talkin' about?

680
00:24:55.538 --> 00:24:58.569
- You know. restoring
my faith in humanity.

681
00:24:58.569 --> 00:25:00.529
- [Lucy] Thanks. I guess?

682
00:25:00.529 --> 00:25:02.440
I'm always happy to help.

683
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.407
- So Lucy. is there
anything I can do for you?

684
00:25:04.407 --> 00:25:07.225
- [Lucy] Well. you can't
play music anymore.

685
00:25:07.225 --> 00:25:08.476
- No. I cannot.

686
00:25:08.476 --> 00:25:10.955
But perhaps. there is something I can do.

687
00:25:10.955 --> 00:25:13.705
(chair clatters)

688
00:25:14.972 --> 00:25:16.607
What is your take

689
00:25:16.607 --> 00:25:20.110
on the recent crave for old LP records?

690
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.767
- [Lucy] (groans) Such a history. man.

691
00:25:21.767 --> 00:25:22.757
(Taz laughs)

692
00:25:22.757 --> 00:25:24.196
- Perhaps.

693
00:25:24.196 --> 00:25:27.615
But I think I have something
that you might like.

694
00:25:27.615 --> 00:25:29.824
Can you see the moon from where you're at?

695
00:25:29.824 --> 00:25:30.965
- [Lucy] Yes. I can.

696
00:25:30.965 --> 00:25:31.891
- It's full. right?

697
00:25:31.891 --> 00:25:33.253
- [Lucy] Not quite.

698
00:25:33.253 --> 00:25:35.251
What do they call it?

699
00:25:35.251 --> 00:25:37.039
Waxing Gibbous?

700
00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:38.164
- Yeah (chuckles).

701
00:25:38.164 --> 00:25:40.350
Yes. it's called Waxing Gibbous.

702
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.029
That'll do.

703
00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.947
(record softly clatters)

704
00:25:42.947 --> 00:25:44.998
(buttons clicking)

705
00:25:44.998 --> 00:25:49.998
(gentle orchestral music)
(footsteps clomping)

706
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.282
(door slams)

707
00:25:54.282 --> 00:25:59.115
("Clair de Lune" by Claude Debussy plays)

708
00:26:11.978 --> 00:26:14.895
(insects chirping)

709
00:26:19.014 --> 00:26:23.347
("Clair de Lune" continues playing)

710
00:26:27.234 --> 00:26:30.151
(insects chirping)

711
00:27:01.362 --> 00:27:03.260
Hope you like that.

712
00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.387
- Thank you.

713
00:27:04.387 --> 00:27:06.637
- No. thank you. Lucy.

714
00:27:06.637 --> 00:27:08.976
- Perhaps. I'll get back
to helping people now.

715
00:27:08.976 --> 00:27:11.528
- All right. don't help 'em too hard.

716
00:27:11.528 --> 00:27:12.361
- Same.

717
00:27:13.624 --> 00:27:14.808
Good bye. Taz.

718
00:27:14.808 --> 00:27:16.387
- Good bye. Lucy.

719
00:27:16.387 --> 00:27:17.376
(button clicks)

720
00:27:17.376 --> 00:27:19.793
(Lucy sighs)

721

You're on the air.

726
00:27:33.444 --> 00:27:35.248
- [Frances] That was beautiful. Taz.

727
00:27:35.248 --> 00:27:37.119
- (Laughs) Thank you.

728
00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:38.080
What's your name?

729
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.984
- [Frances] Oh. my
name's Frances. darlin'.

730
00:27:39.984 --> 00:27:42.073
- Well. thank you for callin'. Frances.

731
00:27:42.073 --> 00:27:43.191
So you like that. huh?

732
00:27:43.191 --> 00:27:44.082
- Of course.
(Taz chuckles)

733
00:27:44.082 --> 00:27:45.948
I have not heard that song in ages.

734
00:27:45.948 --> 00:27:47.623
- Yeah. me neither.

735
00:27:47.623 --> 00:27:49.649
- [Frances] And that
Lucy. she was so nice.

736
00:27:49.649 --> 00:27:51.768
Is she your girlfriend or somethin'?

737
00:27:51.768 --> 00:27:52.627
- No. not at all.

738
00:27:52.627 --> 00:27:54.752
That was my first time talking to her.

739
00:27:54.752 --> 00:27:55.910
- [Frances] Such a sweetheart.

740
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.449
- Yeah. she was.

741
00:27:57.449 --> 00:27:59.408
- [Frances] I deal with
truckers all the time.

742
00:27:59.408 --> 00:28:00.940
Nothin' but truckers.

743
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.055
Listenin' to you guys talk.

744
00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:04.632
it was a breath of fresh air.

745
00:28:04.632 --> 00:28:05.912
- What do you do?

746
00:28:05.912 --> 00:28:09.009
- [Frances] Oh. I'm a waitress. darlin'.

747
00:28:09.009 --> 00:28:09.842
- Well. if I was there.

748
00:28:09.842 --> 00:28:11.363
I'd leave you a big fat tip.

749
00:28:11.363 --> 00:28:13.001
- Why thank you. doll.
(Taz laughs)

750
00:28:13.001 --> 00:28:14.298
- Anytime.

751
00:28:14.298 --> 00:28:15.131
- [Frances] Do you think you could have

752
00:28:15.131 --> 00:28:16.988
Lucy call you again tomorrow?

753
00:28:16.988 --> 00:28:18.591
I'm pulling a double shift.

754
00:28:18.591 --> 00:28:20.048
- We'll see what we can do.

755
00:28:20.048 --> 00:28:21.781
- [Frances] I would appreciate that.

756
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:22.979
- So would I.

757
00:28:22.979 --> 00:28:25.190
- [Frances] Anyways. my
break is almost over.

758
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.477
Thank you for that. Taz.

759
00:28:26.477 --> 00:28:27.658
You've made my night.

760
00:28:27.658 --> 00:28:28.491
- You're more than welcome.

761
00:28:28.491 --> 00:28:29.350
You have a good night. Frances.

762
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:31.600
- All right. bye-bye.
- Bye.

763
00:28:33.379 --> 00:28:34.717
You're on the air.

764
00:28:34.717 --> 00:28:35.550
- [James] Hey. man.

765
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.060
What's up?
- (chuckles) What's up. man?

766
00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.425
What's your name?

767
00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:39.334
- [James] James. dude.

768
00:28:39.334 --> 00:28:40.895
- What's up. James. dude?

769
00:28:40.895 --> 00:28:42.732
(chuckles) What's on your mind?

770
00:28:42.732 --> 00:28:44.490
- [James] That was beautiful. man.

771
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.302
That song and that chick was hella cool.

772
00:28:47.302 --> 00:28:49.787
- (laughs) Yeah. she was.

773
00:28:49.787 --> 00:28:51.590
- [James] You gotta get
her to call you again.

774
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:53.772
- We'll see what we can do.

775
00:28:53.772 --> 00:28:55.731
- [James] I wonder what's
she up to right now?

776
00:28:55.731 --> 00:28:57.266
- Me too. James. dude.

777
00:28:57.266 --> 00:28:58.384
Me too.

778
00:28:58.384 --> 00:28:59.838
(insects chirping)

779
00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:00.796

781
00:29:02.678 --> 00:29:04.290

782
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.234
Hear that baby purr.

783
00:29:06.234 --> 00:29:07.767
- Hey. you got the magic touch.

784
00:29:07.767 --> 00:29:09.630
(engine rumbles)
(hood slams shut)

785
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.715
- All right. you should be good to go.

786
00:29:11.715 --> 00:29:12.548
- Thank you. Lucy.

787
00:29:12.548 --> 00:29:14.135
I don't know why she keeps acting up.

788
00:29:14.135 --> 00:29:15.445
- Yeah. it's probably just an excuse

789
00:29:15.445 --> 00:29:17.236
for you to see me again.

790
00:29:17.236 --> 00:29:18.856
- Yeah. well. here you go.
(Lucy laughs)

791
00:29:18.856 --> 00:29:19.689
Thanks.

792
00:29:19.689 --> 00:29:20.522
- Thank you.

793
00:29:20.522 --> 00:29:21.730
I appreciate it.

794
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.842
- Hey. whatever happened to
that guy you were datin'?

795
00:29:23.842 --> 00:29:24.786
What was his name?

796
00:29:24.786 --> 00:29:26.861
(engine rumbles)

797
00:29:26.861 --> 00:29:27.694
- Duncan?

798
00:29:27.694 --> 00:29:29.380
- Yeah. that's the one.

799
00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.901
- Let's just say. that motor gave out.

800
00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:34.269
- Oh. well that's too bad.

801
00:29:34.269 --> 00:29:35.852
Y'all seemed happy.

802
00:29:36.788 --> 00:29:38.581
- Yeah. well. you better
get going. all right?

803
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:39.414
- All right.

804
00:29:39.414 --> 00:29:40.247

(radio garbles)

817
00:30:14.352 --> 00:30:15.664
- [James] She could be anywhere. man.

818
00:30:15.664 --> 00:30:17.243
- [Taz] That's the beauty of radio.

819
00:30:17.243 --> 00:30:18.264
of dial up telephones.

820
00:30:18.264 --> 00:30:20.163

- [James] What do you mean?

822
00:30:21.291 --> 00:30:22.362
- [Taz] Those stupid cellphones

823
00:30:22.362 --> 00:30:24.324
have stolen the mystery from our lives.

824
00:30:24.324 --> 00:30:25.491

825
00:30:26.488 --> 00:30:28.188
I thought we had enough with PMS.

826
00:30:28.188 --> 00:30:30.283
- Ha. yeah. man. it's crazy.
(Lucy laughs)

827
00:30:30.283 --> 00:30:32.187

this future we live in.

829
00:30:33.372 --> 00:30:34.756
We were lied to about "The Jetsons".

830
00:30:34.756 --> 00:30:35.589
- [James] "The Jetsons"?

831
00:30:35.589 --> 00:30:36.677
No. I don't know what that is.

832
00:30:36.677 --> 00:30:37.734
- [Taz] You're joking. right?

833
00:30:37.734 --> 00:30:39.356
How old are you James. dude?

834
00:30:39.356 --> 00:30:40.335
- Oh. 17.

835

836
00:30:41.676 --> 00:30:43.769
Yeah. we are way past your bedtime.

837
00:30:43.769 --> 00:30:46.198
Good bye. just James.
- Wait. wait. wait. wait!

838
00:30:46.198 --> 00:30:47.557
You think she'll call you?

839
00:30:47.557 --> 00:30:49.118
- [Taz] Answer the question. Jimmy.

840
00:30:49.118 --> 00:30:50.427

We were a huge hit.

even paint drying would
trend at that hour.

944

945

1067
00:39:35.647 --> 00:39:37.435

1069

1073
00:39:45.508 --> 00:39:47.896

entitled idiots out here

00:40:01.117 --> 00:40:02.197
- You're right.

1082
00:40:02.197 --> 00:40:03.030
We don't.

1083
00:40:04.344 --> 00:40:07.834
Cocky people get all
the love and the claim.

1084
00:40:07.834 --> 00:40:11.367
Other people are just there
to pick up the pieces.

1085
00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:13.795
- I thought that's what
you were saying last night?

1086
00:40:13.795 --> 00:40:14.958
- I was.

1087
00:40:14.958 --> 00:40:17.693
- It sounds as if you're
just figuring it out?

1088
00:40:17.693 --> 00:40:20.235
- That's because I'm just
figuring out that I am one.

1089
00:40:20.235 --> 00:40:22.214
- No. not at all.

1090
00:40:22.214 --> 00:40:23.928
- Yes. I am.

1091
00:40:23.928 --> 00:40:26.972
And even now. at the
bottom. I cannot be humble.

1092
00:40:26.972 --> 00:40:29.501
Just wallow in self-pity.

1093
00:40:29.501 --> 00:40:32.267
(scoffs) Think the world should bow to me.

1094
00:40:32.267 --> 00:40:33.431
because I've read a book or two.

1095
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:36.452
and if they don't. I lash out.

1096
00:40:36.452 --> 00:40:38.494
- It's amusing sometimes.

1097
00:40:38.494 --> 00:40:40.096
- Yeah. I thought it was.

1098
00:40:40.096 --> 00:40:40.929
but it's not.

1099
00:40:40.929 --> 00:40:42.955
It's just (scoffs) pathetic.

1100
00:40:42.955 --> 00:40:44.946
- Well. if you feel like that.

1101
00:40:44.946 --> 00:40:46.014
you can change it.

1102
00:40:46.014 --> 00:40:47.648
- You really think people can change?

1103
00:40:47.648 --> 00:40:48.682
- I don't know.

1104
00:40:48.682 --> 00:40:49.985
I've spent my whole lifetime

1105
00:40:49.985 --> 00:40:51.448
waiting for someone to change.

1106
00:40:51.448 --> 00:40:53.115
and they never have.

1107
00:40:54.655 --> 00:40:57.247
(sighs) But I trust you.

1108
00:40:57.247 --> 00:40:58.637
You can change.

1109
00:40:58.637 --> 00:41:00.193
- You trust me?

1110
00:41:00.193 --> 00:41:02.836
I thought you just said.
trusting people wasn't smart?

1111
00:41:02.836 --> 00:41:06.167
- I guess I'm not that smart either.

1112
00:41:06.167 --> 00:41:07.156
- Well. I like having these

1113
00:41:07.156 --> 00:41:08.650
not-so-smart conversations with you.

1114
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.628
- Yeah. I do too.

1115
00:41:10.628 --> 00:41:12.177
But I have to go now.

1116
00:41:12.177 --> 00:41:13.388
- Okay. wait.

1117
00:41:13.388 --> 00:41:14.497
- What?

1118
00:41:14.497 --> 00:41:17.662
- Would you care to do
this again tomorrow night?

1119
00:41:17.662 --> 00:41:18.746
- Sure.

1120
00:41:18.746 --> 00:41:20.398
- Does 2:00 AM work for you?

1121
00:41:20.398 --> 00:41:22.433
- Yes. that's fine.

1122
00:41:22.433 --> 00:41:23.968
- Okay. then it's a date.

1123
00:41:23.968 --> 00:41:24.801
- Okay.

1124
00:41:25.645 --> 00:41:27.187
Goodbye. Taz.

1125
00:41:27.187 --> 00:41:28.187
- Bye. Lucy.

1126
00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.856
(phone receiver clangs softly)

1127
00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.543

- People seem to like it.

1185
00:44:18.943 --> 00:44:20.444
Have you heard it?

1186
00:44:20.444 --> 00:44:23.944
- I started to. but I couldn't stomach it.

1187
00:44:25.068 --> 00:44:26.281
- It's different.

1188
00:44:26.281 --> 00:44:28.696
- Like good different?

1189
00:44:28.696 --> 00:44:30.487
- People just like a novelty.

1190
00:44:30.487 --> 00:44:33.108
- How long has it been going on?

1191
00:44:33.108 --> 00:44:36.153
- Antoinette. stop worrying about him.

00:44:36.153 --> 00:44:37.238
In a week nobody's gonna care about

1193
00:44:37.238 --> 00:44:39.071

1197
00:44:54.294 --> 00:44:55.498
- Hey. hungry hippo.

1198
00:44:55.498 --> 00:44:56.887
- Why am I hungry hippo?

1199
00:44:56.887 --> 00:44:59.080
- Because you're always eating in there.

1200
00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.757
- Oh. right.

1201
00:45:00.757 --> 00:45:03.227
You should see the spread
we got down here nowadays.

1202
00:45:03.227 --> 00:45:04.873
- Yeah. what is it?

1203
00:45:04.873 --> 00:45:07.195
- There's gluten free crackers.

1204
00:45:07.195 --> 00:45:09.044
a little Burrata cheese.

1205
00:45:09.044 --> 00:45:10.835
a little avocado toast. mmm.

1206
00:45:10.835 --> 00:45:12.156
- Uck!
(Taz groans)

1207
00:45:12.156 --> 00:45:13.155
- Girl. it's delicious.

1208
00:45:13.155 --> 00:45:14.962
- You are a despicable hipster.

1209
00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:16.354
That's who you are.

1210
00:45:16.354 --> 00:45:18.866
- (scoffs) Eating good makes
me a despicable hipster?

1211
00:45:18.866 --> 00:45:20.315
- Yeah. you can still eat good

1212
00:45:20.315 --> 00:45:22.642
without eating all that pretentious crap.

1213
00:45:22.642 --> 00:45:23.555
- Have you tried it out?

1214
00:45:23.555 --> 00:45:24.680
- No. I haven't.

1215
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.922
I can't afford it.

1216
00:45:25.922 --> 00:45:27.054
- What do you normally eat?

1217
00:45:27.054 --> 00:45:28.593
- That's a personal question.

1218
00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:29.426
- No. it's not.

1219
00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:30.459
- It totally is.

1220
00:45:30.459 --> 00:45:31.745
because if I tell you what I eat

1221
00:45:31.745 --> 00:45:33.814
then you can make all sorts of judgements.

1222
00:45:33.814 --> 00:45:36.705
you know. about who I am. how I live. so.

1223
00:45:36.705 --> 00:45:38.993
- Okay. first of all. I
wouldn't dare do that.

1224
00:45:38.993 --> 00:45:41.394
- Yeah. that's what they all say.

1225
00:45:41.394 --> 00:45:42.609
- I'm not them.

1226
00:45:42.609 --> 00:45:43.942
Come on. try me.

1227
00:45:45.595 --> 00:45:46.835
(Lucy sighs)
Okay.

1228
00:45:46.835 --> 00:45:47.975
How 'bout this?

1229
00:45:47.975 --> 00:45:50.205
If you were rich. you can
eat anything you want.

1230
00:45:50.205 --> 00:45:51.038
what would you eat?

1231
00:45:51.038 --> 00:45:53.033

1232
00:45:53.033 --> 00:45:57.716

- Okay. okay.

1237
00:46:06.753 --> 00:46:07.586
Come on. tell me.

1238
00:46:07.586 --> 00:46:09.494
What would you eat?

1239
00:46:09.494 --> 00:46:10.574
- I think I know.

1240
00:46:10.574 --> 00:46:11.637
Once. when I was a little.

1241
00:46:11.637 --> 00:46:13.836
my dad took me to this
really nice restaurant.

1242
00:46:13.836 --> 00:46:14.745
- Oh. yeah. which one?

1243
00:46:14.745 --> 00:46:15.703
- Italian.

1244
00:46:15.703 --> 00:46:16.951
- [Taz] Mamma mia!

1245
00:46:16.951 --> 00:46:20.012
- It was the nicest
restaurant I've ever been at.

1246
00:46:20.012 --> 00:46:22.410
I mean. I was used to just Mickey D's.

1247
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:24.160
but this place. nice.

1248
00:46:25.112 --> 00:46:27.653
The waiters were dressed
up and so were we.

1249
00:46:27.653 --> 00:46:28.486
- All right.

1250
00:46:28.486 --> 00:46:29.319
Did you wear a dress?

1251
00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:30.374
- I did.

1252
00:46:30.374 --> 00:46:31.207
- How old were you?

1253
00:46:31.207 --> 00:46:34.202
- Nine. but my dad ordered for me.

1254
00:46:34.202 --> 00:46:36.098
so I had no idea what was coming out.

1255
00:46:36.098 --> 00:46:37.132
- What did he order?

1256
00:46:37.132 --> 00:46:37.965
- Some pasta.

1257
00:46:37.965 --> 00:46:41.132
But listen. that wasn't the big deal.

1258
00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:42.471
Right before the meal came.

1259
00:46:42.471 --> 00:46:47.403
the waiters brought out a
fresh basket full of the rolls.

1260
00:46:47.403 --> 00:46:50.434
I never knew bread could be so good.

1261
00:46:50.434 --> 00:46:54.262
I mean. I was used to
toast on my PB&J sandwich.

1262
00:46:54.262 --> 00:46:58.751
but these. (sighs) they were so soft.

1263
00:46:58.751 --> 00:47:00.418
and smelled so good.

1264
00:47:02.254 --> 00:47:07.254
(moans) They were soft and
crunchy at the same time.

1265
00:47:07.452 --> 00:47:09.197
There was this butter on the table.

1266
00:47:09.197 --> 00:47:10.046
and I took it.

1267
00:47:10.046 --> 00:47:14.412
and I spread it across the
roll as I cracked it open.

1268
00:47:14.412 --> 00:47:16.912
then I took a tiny. slow bite.

1269
00:47:18.111 --> 00:47:22.093
It sent electrical shocks
all through my body.

1270
00:47:22.093 --> 00:47:25.260
First. in my mouth. then in my tongue.

1271
00:47:26.172 --> 00:47:29.172
You know. that salty. buttery taste.

1272
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:34.133
(sighs) It's making me feel all warm

1273
00:47:34.133 --> 00:47:36.342
just talking about it.

1274
00:47:36.342 --> 00:47:39.096
We didn't have many
great times as a child.

1275
00:47:39.096 --> 00:47:40.429
but those rolls.

1276
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:43.854
those rolls were magical.

1277
00:47:49.573 --> 00:47:51.693
Taz. are you there?

1278
00:47:51.693 --> 00:47:52.581
- Yeah (clears throat).

1279
00:47:52.581 --> 00:47:53.583
Yeah (laughs).

1280
00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:54.416
Yeah. I'm here.

1281
00:47:54.416 --> 00:47:55.249
I'm here.

1282
00:47:56.249 --> 00:47:57.082
That was a good story.

1283
00:47:57.082 --> 00:47:57.915
That was a good story.

1284
00:47:57.915 --> 00:47:58.813
You got my mouth all waterin'

1285
00:47:58.813 --> 00:48:00.742
for some rolls and butter now.

1286
00:48:00.742 --> 00:48:02.254
- Well. maybe you should go get some.

1287
00:48:02.254 --> 00:48:04.174
instead of that gluten free crap?

1288
00:48:04.174 --> 00:48:05.692
- Perhaps.

1289
00:48:05.692 --> 00:48:08.894
Perhaps you and I can go
get somethin' together?

1290
00:48:08.894 --> 00:48:09.888
- Really?

1291
00:48:09.888 --> 00:48:11.354
- Oh. yeah (chuckles).

1292
00:48:11.354 --> 00:48:12.935
I'd-

1293
00:48:12.935 --> 00:48:14.343
(door slams shut)
- Lucy. we'll be right back

1294
00:48:14.343 --> 00:48:16.152
after these commercial messages.

1295
00:48:16.152 --> 00:48:17.792
Thank you.

1296
00:48:17.792 --> 00:48:18.875
(phone receiver clatters)
Hi. Lucy?

1297
00:48:18.875 --> 00:48:19.953
Could you hold on for a moment?

1298
00:48:19.953 --> 00:48:21.697
- Okay. that's fine.
- Thank you.

1299
00:48:21.697 --> 00:48:22.811
(phone receiver clatters)

1300
00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:23.644
- What are you doing?

1301
00:48:23.644 --> 00:48:24.922
- No. what are you doing?

1302
00:48:24.922 --> 00:48:25.780
- What are you talking about?

1303
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:26.767
- What am I talking about?

1304
00:48:26.767 --> 00:48:28.700
You're trying to meet her?

1305
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.462
Okay. she's the goose
that lays our golden eggs.

1306
00:48:32.462 --> 00:48:33.801
and you want to kill that?

1307
00:48:33.801 --> 00:48:35.401
- No. I Just-

1308
00:48:35.401 --> 00:48:37.040
- Want to meet her?
- Yeah.

1309
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.831
- That would destroy all
the magic between you two.

1310
00:48:39.831 --> 00:48:42.252
- I think we could make more magic.

1311
00:48:42.252 --> 00:48:43.651
- Come on. man.

1312
00:48:43.651 --> 00:48:44.484
Think!

1313
00:48:46.031 --> 00:48:50.801
Have you ever had a
relationship that ended well?

1314
00:48:50.801 --> 00:48:53.450
- No. but I think this could be different.

1315
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:54.463
- Hey. you think?

1316
00:48:54.463 --> 00:48:58.716
Okay. well. you are
winning right now. right?

1317
00:48:58.716 --> 00:49:00.544
Okay. you're on top again. right?

1318
00:49:00.544 --> 00:49:01.377
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1319
00:49:01.377 --> 00:49:02.710
And people love you. right?
- Yes.

1320
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:06.877
- Okay. so you want to
risk losing all that again?

1321
00:49:08.392 --> 00:49:10.494
People are crazy for her.

1322
00:49:10.494 --> 00:49:15.048
because they imagine her
to be this gorgeous girl.

1323
00:49:15.048 --> 00:49:17.590
and you imagine it too.

1324
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.783
but what if she's ugly?

1325
00:49:19.783 --> 00:49:21.857
Do you really want to keep this up?

1326
00:49:21.857 --> 00:49:24.666
- Look. I just wanna meet her. all right?

1327
00:49:24.666 --> 00:49:25.891
I don't even care how she looks.

1328
00:49:25.891 --> 00:49:27.459
To me. she's beautiful already.

1329
00:49:27.459 --> 00:49:29.183
- What if she's got a scar?

1330
00:49:29.183 --> 00:49:30.173
She's got no teeth?

1331
00:49:30.173 --> 00:49:31.006
She's bald?

1332
00:49:31.006 --> 00:49:32.277
She's got one eyeball?

1333
00:49:32.277 --> 00:49:33.563
And she's got a hook for a hand?

1334
00:49:33.563 --> 00:49:34.625
What if she's four feet tall?

1335
00:49:34.625 --> 00:49:35.595
What if she has three toes?

1336
00:49:35.595 --> 00:49:37.084
- Okay. okay!

1337
00:49:37.084 --> 00:49:38.625
You've made your point.

1338
00:49:38.625 --> 00:49:41.625
- This works because of the mystery.

1339
00:49:42.883 --> 00:49:45.050
If you see her. it's over.

1340
00:49:46.259 --> 00:49:48.285
Do you really want it to be over?

1341
00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:49.914
- Okay.

1342
00:49:49.914 --> 00:49:52.634
Okay. I won't meet her.

1343
00:49:52.634 --> 00:49:53.878
- Okay. good.

1344
00:49:53.878 --> 00:49:55.195
Try to end the call.

1345
00:49:55.195 --> 00:49:56.796
We got another call waiting.

1346
00:49:56.796 --> 00:49:57.795
Are you crazy?

1347
00:49:57.795 --> 00:49:59.326
Is there something wrong with you?

1348
00:49:59.326 --> 00:50:02.243
(sultry pop music)

1349
00:50:05.364 --> 00:50:07.635
♪ Oh ♪

1350
00:50:07.635 --> 00:50:08.856
- And we're back.

1351
00:50:08.856 --> 00:50:10.456
Sorry to keep you waiting. Lucy.

1352
00:50:10.456 --> 00:50:11.548
- That's fine.

1353
00:50:11.548 --> 00:50:13.920
- Listen. those rolls.

1354
00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.344
they sounded amazing.

1355
00:50:15.344 --> 00:50:16.987
But you know what I would have?

1356
00:50:16.987 --> 00:50:21.599
I'd have one of those Wagyu
filets mignons. medium rare.

1357
00:50:21.599 --> 00:50:22.773
Now. those are the best.

1358
00:50:22.773 --> 00:50:26.017
- Yeah. well. after we get the rolls.

1359
00:50:26.017 --> 00:50:28.017
- Yeah. after the rolls.

1360
00:50:28.975 --> 00:50:31.463
So listen. I'm getting a
signal from my producer.

1361
00:50:31.463 --> 00:50:33.113
It looks like we have
another commercial spot.

1362
00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:34.030
- Oh. okay.

1363
00:50:35.047 --> 00:50:38.233
- Yeah. popular girl.
and the show's a hit.

1364
00:50:38.233 --> 00:50:40.526
Everybody wants to be on the show.

1365
00:50:40.526 --> 00:50:42.300
So same time tomorrow?

1366
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.217
- Yes. sure. same time.

1367
00:50:45.754 --> 00:50:47.174
Have a good night. Taz.

1368
00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:48.757
- Good night. Lucy.

1369
00:50:50.462 --> 00:50:53.852
(phone receiver clatters)

1370
00:50:53.852 --> 00:50:55.106
(Lucy sighs)

1371
00:50:55.106 --> 00:50:57.608
(door clatters open)

1372
00:50:57.608 --> 00:50:59.088
(door slams shut)
(plaque thuds)

1373
00:50:59.088 --> 00:51:03.171
(melancholic instrumental music)

1374
00:51:24.375 --> 00:51:26.160
(Antoinette speaks indistinctly)

1375
00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.692
I hate you!

1376
00:51:27.692 --> 00:51:29.966
(Antoinette laughs)

1377
00:51:29.966 --> 00:51:31.046
(Taz gasps)

1378
00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:33.879
(heavy breathing)

1379
00:51:37.271 --> 00:51:39.688
(Taz groans)

1380
00:51:42.168 --> 00:51:44.150
(yawns) Sorry.

1381
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:45.180
- Are you okay?

1382
00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:48.331
- Yeah. guess I didn't sleep
well last night. that's all.

1383
00:51:48.331 --> 00:51:50.210
- Your conscious won't let you sleep?

1384
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:51.641
- I don't think I have one of those.

1385
00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:53.488
- Sure you do.

1386
00:51:53.488 --> 00:51:55.071
- You think?
- Yeah.

1387
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:58.578
- You ever have a problem sleepin'?

1388
00:51:58.578 --> 00:52:00.139
- (sighs) I used to.

1389
00:52:00.139 --> 00:52:02.529
but now. I'm just so tired.

1390
00:52:02.529 --> 00:52:03.609
- What kept you up?

1391
00:52:03.609 --> 00:52:04.749
- My ex.

1392
00:52:04.749 --> 00:52:07.049
- (scoffs) We've all been there.

1393
00:52:07.049 --> 00:52:08.528
stressin' over someone.

1394
00:52:08.528 --> 00:52:11.050
- [Lucy] (sighs) It was more than that.

1395
00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:12.710
- What happened?

1396
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:15.730
- (exhales loudly) I don't
think I wanna talk about this.

1397
00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:17.340
- Oh. come on. Lucy.

1398
00:52:17.340 --> 00:52:19.340
If it's over. it's over.

1399
00:52:20.294 --> 00:52:23.670
Okay. how 'bout I tell you about my ex?

1400
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:26.837
The great love of my life betrayed me.

1401
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:30.677
stole from me.

1402
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:35.143
then went on to a life
of fortune and glory.

1403
00:52:35.143 --> 00:52:36.943
- Yeah. well. your life
is still pretty good.

1404
00:52:36.943 --> 00:52:38.592
despite all of that.

1405
00:52:38.592 --> 00:52:39.425
- Perhaps.

1406
00:52:40.374 --> 00:52:43.442
But I can't help but think
about what could've been.

1407
00:52:43.442 --> 00:52:44.275
- Yeah.

1408
00:52:45.793 --> 00:52:47.381
- I sure can pick 'em (laughs).

1409
00:52:47.381 --> 00:52:48.214
- Me too.

1410
00:52:49.373 --> 00:52:51.845
Me too (sighs).

1411
00:52:51.845 --> 00:52:54.004
- So what about your ex?

1412
00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:56.254
- I think about the what ifs.

1413
00:52:56.254 --> 00:52:58.312
- What if things were different?

1414
00:52:58.312 --> 00:53:01.586
- No. just what if I
would have never met him?

1415
00:53:01.586 --> 00:53:05.372
What if I never would have
said yes to the first date?

1416
00:53:05.372 --> 00:53:09.042
He would have never destroyed my faith.

1417
00:53:09.042 --> 00:53:10.709
stolen my happiness.

1418
00:53:12.614 --> 00:53:13.781
killed my joy.

1419
00:53:17.114 --> 00:53:19.089
Now. I'm just afraid.

1420
00:53:19.089 --> 00:53:19.973
- Of what?

1421
00:53:19.973 --> 00:53:22.689
- Another shark in the
water that smells blood

1422
00:53:22.689 --> 00:53:25.752
and comes to finish me off for good.

1423
00:53:25.752 --> 00:53:28.112
- What did he do?
- Everything.

1424
00:53:28.112 --> 00:53:29.572
- What keeps you going?

1425
00:53:29.572 --> 00:53:31.337
- The small things.

1426
00:53:31.337 --> 00:53:33.473
the simple pleasures in life.

1427
00:53:33.473 --> 00:53:37.502
Driving my car. warming up
some noodles. talking to you.

1428
00:53:37.502 --> 00:53:41.498
- (chuckles) Well. the feeling is mutual.

1429
00:53:41.498 --> 00:53:42.331
I don't know how I could have

1430
00:53:42.331 --> 00:53:44.190
kept this thing going without you.

1431
00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:45.051
- Yeah. but I don't know

1432
00:53:45.051 --> 00:53:47.451
if your audience would appreciate this.

1433
00:53:47.451 --> 00:53:48.284
- Why not?

1434
00:53:48.284 --> 00:53:49.402
- Too depressing.

1435
00:53:49.402 --> 00:53:51.561
- No. it's real.

1436
00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:53.581
They like you because you keep it real.

1437
00:53:53.581 --> 00:53:54.414
- Me?

1438
00:53:54.414 --> 00:53:55.462
What about you?

1439
00:53:55.462 --> 00:53:58.106
- No. I'm just show business.

1440
00:53:58.106 --> 00:53:59.237
- Stop!

1441
00:53:59.237 --> 00:54:01.442
You're more than that.

1442
00:54:01.442 --> 00:54:02.734
You're just afraid.

1443
00:54:02.734 --> 00:54:04.022
- Of what?

1444
00:54:04.022 --> 00:54:05.442
- Exposing yourself.

1445
00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:07.942
like really exposing yourself.

1446
00:54:09.117 --> 00:54:11.081
You put up this wall.

1447
00:54:11.081 --> 00:54:12.573
All of the aggression.

1448
00:54:12.573 --> 00:54:15.049
the self-deprecating remarks.

1449
00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:16.875
it's just all a front

1450
00:54:16.875 --> 00:54:18.944
so people don't see the real you.

1451
00:54:18.944 --> 00:54:20.163
- I don't think the real me

1452
00:54:20.163 --> 00:54:22.471
would be interesting enough for a show.

1453
00:54:22.471 --> 00:54:24.241
- It will be.

1454
00:54:24.241 --> 00:54:25.475
You should try it.

1455
00:54:25.475 --> 00:54:26.778
- Yeah.

1456
00:54:26.778 --> 00:54:28.395
- But I gotta go.

1457
00:54:28.395 --> 00:54:29.794
and I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1458
00:54:29.794 --> 00:54:30.998
- All right. Lucy.

1459
00:54:30.998 --> 00:54:32.693
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1460
00:54:32.693 --> 00:54:34.693
- (laughs) Okay.

1461
00:54:34.693 --> 00:54:36.276
Goodbye. Taz.
- Bye.

1462
00:54:38.173 --> 00:54:39.842
We'll be right back after this.

1463
00:54:39.842 --> 00:54:44.842
(gentle instrumental music)
(Lucy exhales loudly)

1464
00:54:45.187 --> 00:54:46.020
- Taz.

1465
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:49.067
(phone receiver clatters)

1466
00:54:49.067 --> 00:54:52.650
(Lucy speaks indistinctly)

1467
00:54:53.733 --> 00:54:57.292
(exhales loudly)

1468
00:54:57.292 --> 00:55:01.217
- [Radio Announcer] You listen to WGNS

1469
00:55:01.217 --> 00:55:06.129
with DJ Taz the Maz.
(button softly clicks)

1470
00:55:06.129 --> 00:55:07.419
- Hey. early bird.

1471
00:55:07.419 --> 00:55:11.919
- Hey. Galen.
(ominous dramatic music)

1472
00:55:13.388 --> 00:55:14.757
- You're taking somebody's spot.

1473
00:55:14.757 --> 00:55:16.467
- [Antoinette] Oh. I wasn't aware

1474
00:55:16.467 --> 00:55:19.371
I need an appointment to call your show?

1475
00:55:19.371 --> 00:55:21.248
- Now is not the time. okay?

1476
00:55:21.248 --> 00:55:22.383
- Let's.

1477
00:55:22.383 --> 00:55:26.600
You're not gonna introduce
me to your audience?

1478
00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.960
- We have Heidi on the line.

1479
00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:28.918
(Antoinette laughs)

1480
00:55:28.918 --> 00:55:30.541
- [Antoinette] Well. at
least you could be honest

1481
00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:32.124
with your audience.

1482
00:55:36.441 --> 00:55:39.402
- I will. as soon as you're
honest with your fans.

1483
00:55:39.402 --> 00:55:41.962
- Galen. why don't you
play any of my music?

1484
00:55:41.962 --> 00:55:44.479
- Because I don't like any of
your phony music. Antoinette.

1485
00:55:44.479 --> 00:55:45.930
- I'm sorry you don't like it.

1486
00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:49.729
You know. most of my music is about us.

1487
00:55:49.729 --> 00:55:51.326
(tool clanks)
- No. they are about you.

1488
00:55:51.326 --> 00:55:53.280
Why are you calling me right now?

1489
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.506
You're a big enough deal

1490
00:55:54.506 --> 00:55:57.032
that you should be doing
some late night talk show.

1491
00:55:57.032 --> 00:55:59.526
But no. you're so dead inside

1492
00:55:59.526 --> 00:56:00.913
that you can't stand the idea

1493
00:56:00.913 --> 00:56:02.969
of someone else getting attention.

1494
00:56:02.969 --> 00:56:06.410
- Oh. are you talking about
your virtual girlfriend?

1495
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:08.337
- Look. she ain't my
girlfriend. all right?

1496
00:56:08.337 --> 00:56:09.971
- You're so defenseless. Galen.

1497
00:56:09.971 --> 00:56:12.937
(scoffs) You must really
like this Lucy girl?

1498
00:56:12.937 --> 00:56:14.020
- Maybe I do.

1499
00:56:15.847 --> 00:56:18.732
(covers rustling)
(Antoinette sighs)

1500
00:56:18.732 --> 00:56:23.332
- Do you remember when we
used to stay up all night.

1501
00:56:23.332 --> 00:56:26.751
and we would listen to all sorts of music.

1502
00:56:26.751 --> 00:56:29.346
and we would talk about movies.

1503
00:56:29.346 --> 00:56:32.109
and then politics and religion.

1504
00:56:32.109 --> 00:56:33.892
and plan our lives together?

1505
00:56:33.892 --> 00:56:35.897
- But you are killing my show right now.

1506
00:56:35.897 --> 00:56:38.022
- Galen. I really thought by now

1507
00:56:38.022 --> 00:56:41.381
you would be some like
big-time music producer.

1508
00:56:41.381 --> 00:56:43.330
I would have never guessed

1509
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:46.420
that you would be an AM talk show host.

1510
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.532
- You think I like this shit. huh?

1511
00:56:48.532 --> 00:56:50.360
Stayin' up wee hours a night.

1512
00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.585
eatin' nasty ass pizza.

1513
00:56:51.585 --> 00:56:52.549
and talking to losers

1514
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:54.520
that nothing better to do but to call me?

1515
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:57.640
- Well. then quit this
job. and come work for me.

1516
00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:02.223
- (scoffs) I would never work for you.

1517
00:57:02.223 --> 00:57:04.092
You stole your whole sound from me.

1518
00:57:04.092 --> 00:57:07.576
so you and your managers
can go fuck yourselves.

1519
00:57:07.576 --> 00:57:09.430
(knocking on window)

1520
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:12.051
- I didn't steal anything from you.

1521
00:57:12.051 --> 00:57:13.968
- No. you just used me.

1522
00:57:15.221 --> 00:57:17.099
You needed me to write for you

1523
00:57:17.099 --> 00:57:18.941
and introduce you around.

1524
00:57:18.941 --> 00:57:20.230
You forgot who you are.

1525
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:22.201
But I know the real you.

1526
00:57:22.201 --> 00:57:25.251
So it doesn't matter how much glitter.

1527
00:57:25.251 --> 00:57:27.767
fancy clothes you put on.

1528
00:57:27.767 --> 00:57:30.247
you still ain't shit. bitch.

1529
00:57:30.247 --> 00:57:31.201
- Fuck you!

1530
00:57:31.201 --> 00:57:32.380
Fuck you son of a bitch!

1531
00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.522
How dare you talk to me like that!

1532
00:57:34.522 --> 00:57:37.068
No. you became nothing without me.

1533
00:57:37.068 --> 00:57:38.281
And you would still be nothing.

1534
00:57:38.281 --> 00:57:40.008
if not for some deranged woman

1535
00:57:40.008 --> 00:57:42.031
calling you in the middle of the night.

1536
00:57:42.031 --> 00:57:43.094
You need us bitches!

1537
00:57:43.094 --> 00:57:45.070
- I don't need you. Antoinette.

1538
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.742
I don't need Lucy either.

1539
00:57:46.742 --> 00:57:49.007
I'm DJ Taz the Maz.

1540
00:57:49.007 --> 00:57:52.236
Well. sure. I'm stuck
here talking to losers

1541
00:57:52.236 --> 00:57:53.091
and a deranged women

1542
00:57:53.091 --> 00:57:53.924
that has nothing better to do

1543
00:57:53.924 --> 00:57:55.175
but to call me every single night.

1544
00:57:55.175 --> 00:57:58.070
Sure. I'm taking orders from
a Latino mob boss wanna-be.

1545
00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:01.101
but at least I know who I am.

1546
00:58:01.101 --> 00:58:01.934
Now. maybe one day.

1547
00:58:01.934 --> 00:58:04.911
they'll find you dead with
a bullet in your skull.

1548
00:58:04.911 --> 00:58:06.703
and it'll all be over.

1549
00:58:06.703 --> 00:58:10.029
Just another footnote in a
book of washed up celebrities.

1550
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:11.869
(uptempo rock music)

1551
00:58:11.869 --> 00:58:12.702
(Antoinette yells)
(slapping)

1552
00:58:12.702 --> 00:58:14.974
- What are you doing?

1553
00:58:14.974 --> 00:58:15.807
(Antoinette scoffs)

1554
00:58:15.807 --> 00:58:20.169
(uptempo rock music continues)

1555
00:58:20.169 --> 00:58:23.502
(headphones clattering)

1556
00:58:24.872 --> 00:58:25.705
- Hey. man.

1557
00:58:25.705 --> 00:58:26.617
What was that?

1558
00:58:26.617 --> 00:58:28.578
- [Taz] I'm done.

1559
00:58:28.578 --> 00:58:29.938
- Oh. whoa!

1560
00:58:29.938 --> 00:58:31.419
(shuffling)

1561
00:58:31.419 --> 00:58:32.488
You're just gonna leave like that?

1562
00:58:32.488 --> 00:58:34.018
- No. I fucking quit!

1563
00:58:34.018 --> 00:58:35.712
(footsteps pattering)

1564
00:58:35.712 --> 00:58:36.545
(door clatters open)

1565
00:58:36.545 --> 00:58:37.587
(door slams shut)

1566
00:58:37.587 --> 00:58:39.399
(creeper shuffling)
Hello. everybody.

1567
00:58:39.399 --> 00:58:42.353
with DJ Taz the Maz at WGNS.

1568
00:58:42.353 --> 00:58:43.186
So listen.
(tool clangs)

1569
00:58:43.186 --> 00:58:44.440
when I'm in the city and I get hungry.

1570
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:47.131
I make sure I go get me
one of them Crackin' Tacos.

1571
00:58:47.131 --> 00:58:51.464
Man. them tacos are-

Oh. it's nice meeting you. Mr. Wayne.

1582
00:59:21.753 --> 00:59:22.879
I work at the bank.

1583
00:59:22.879 --> 00:59:25.100
and I brought some contracts
over here for you today.

1584
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.192
- Well. thank you.

1585
00:59:26.192 --> 00:59:28.412
- I thought about bringing
them to you in person.

1586
00:59:28.412 --> 00:59:31.056
but I realize that you're a very busy man.

1587
00:59:31.056 --> 00:59:32.596

out Lucille speaking)

1595
00:59:49.949 --> 00:59:52.410
When they ask you for your
autograph and everything?

1596
00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:54.663
- [John Wayne] Well. I never
considered that a bother.

1597
00:59:54.663 --> 00:59:56.314
- [Lucille] Well. can
I have your autograph?

1598
00:59:56.314 --> 00:59:59.652
(audience laughs on TV)
- Of course.

1599
00:59:59.652 --> 01:00:01.485
- [Lucille] Thank you.

1600
01:00:02.871 --> 01:00:05.305
- Did you bring a piece of paper?

1601
01:00:05.305 --> 01:00:06.138
- No.

1602
01:00:10.244 --> 01:00:12.661

1603
01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.632
- [Voicemail] You have 14 new messages.

(male speaks indistinctly)
Message deleted.

1605
01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:38.008
- [Tony] Hey. man. you
better pick up the phone.

1606
01:00:38.008 --> 01:00:39.698
I'm not-
- Message deleted.

1607
01:00:39.698 --> 01:00:40.531
- [Tony] Listen to me.

1608
01:00:40.531 --> 01:00:43.114
Listen to me!

01:00:44.529 --> 01:00:48.663
(Taz groans and grunts)

1610
01:00:48.663 --> 01:00:52.147
(radio garbles)

1611
01:00:52.147 --> 01:00:53.317
- [Radio Announcer] The Silly DJ.

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:56.266
sports. talk. music. and more.

1613
01:00:56.266 --> 01:00:58.318
- [Willy] Yo. yo. yo.
what's going on. people?

1614
01:00:58.318 --> 01:01:01.456
This is your boy. Willy the Silly DJ.

1615
01:01:01.456 --> 01:01:02.948
and we've got Lindy on the line.

1616
01:01:02.948 --> 01:01:05.115
Welcome to WCKR FM. Lindy.

1617
01:01:06.146 --> 01:01:07.087
- [Lindy] Hello. Willy.

1618
01:01:07.087 --> 01:01:08.759
- [Willy] All right. so Lindy.

1619
01:01:08.759 --> 01:01:11.254
tell us about your worst life experience.

1620
01:01:11.254 --> 01:01:12.617
- [Lindy] It's a little bit too dark.

1621
01:01:12.617 --> 01:01:15.086
- [Willy] Well. you know.
everything is accepted here.

1622
01:01:15.086 --> 01:01:17.431
except ongoing criminal investigation.

1623
01:01:17.431 --> 01:01:19.058
so go ahead.
(Lindy laughs)

1624
01:01:19.058 --> 01:01:20.058
- [Lindy] No crime.

1625
01:01:20.058 --> 01:01:21.956
My worst life experience

1626
01:01:21.956 --> 01:01:24.716
was the day I got diagnosed with leukemia.

1627
01:01:24.716 --> 01:01:25.549
- [Willy] Oh. wow.

1628
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:26.605
I'm so. so sorry

1629
01:01:26.605 --> 01:01:28.587
to hear about that. Lindy.
- Don't be sorry.

1630
01:01:28.587 --> 01:01:31.189
because one of my best life experience

1631
01:01:31.189 --> 01:01:33.813
is when the doctor told
me I was cancer free.

1632
01:01:33.813 --> 01:01:35.459
I made it. Willy!

1633
01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:36.338
- [Willy] Oh!

1634
01:01:36.338 --> 01:01:39.349
Oh. well that's awesome. Lindy.

1635
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:40.182
Wow!

1636
01:01:40.182 --> 01:01:41.017
Thank you for sharing that.

1637
01:01:41.017 --> 01:01:43.389
- [Lindy] No. thank you for allowing me

1638
01:01:43.389 --> 01:01:44.808
to share it on your station.

1639
01:01:44.808 --> 01:01:46.219
- [Willy] Anytime. doll.

1640
01:01:46.219 --> 01:01:47.604
You know. I understand.

1641
01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:48.841
We're all family here.

1642
01:01:48.841 --> 01:01:49.726
- [Lindy] That's right.

1643
01:01:49.726 --> 01:01:52.567
but there's sometimes we feel all alone.

1644
01:01:52.567 --> 01:01:54.300
(Lindy sobs)

1645
01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.134
But once we know others have been though

1646
01:01:56.134 --> 01:01:57.248
what we've been through

1647
01:01:57.248 --> 01:01:58.239
and made it-
- Yes. Lindy.

1648
01:01:58.239 --> 01:01:59.322
- Yes. yeah.
- It gives us hope.

1649
01:01:59.322 --> 01:02:00.996
- [Willy] We all need a bit of hope.

1650
01:02:00.996 --> 01:02:03.454
Lindy. cry if you want. okay?

1651
01:02:03.454 --> 01:02:04.287
We got yeah.

1652
01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:05.604
Don't worry about it.
- Give me a break.

1653
01:02:05.604 --> 01:02:07.083
- We're here to support you.
(button clicks)

1654
01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:09.416
(Taz sighs)

1655
01:02:17.212 --> 01:02:18.455
(phone trilling)

1656
01:02:18.455 --> 01:02:19.288
- [Tony] What up?

1657
01:02:19.288 --> 01:02:20.176
This is Tony.

1658
01:02:20.176 --> 01:02:21.416
You mes with me. Ese.

1659
01:02:21.416 --> 01:02:23.175
I mess with you. Ese.

1660
01:02:23.175 --> 01:02:24.565
Leave a message for me.
(message beeps)

1661
01:02:24.565 --> 01:02:25.398
- Hey. Tony.

1662
01:02:25.398 --> 01:02:26.231
It's me.

1663
01:02:27.256 --> 01:02:28.589
Look. I'm sorry.

1664
01:02:29.566 --> 01:02:31.899
Give me a call back. please.

1665
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:39.703
(Taz sighs)
(phone rings)

1666
01:02:39.703 --> 01:02:40.536
Hey.

1667
01:02:40.536 --> 01:02:42.524
- [Tony] Meet me at the station at 1:30.

1668
01:02:42.524 --> 01:02:46.774
You better be there.
(phone beeps)

1669
01:02:48.944 --> 01:02:52.944
(door clatters open and creaks)

1670
01:02:53.885 --> 01:02:54.718
(door slams shut)

1671
01:02:54.718 --> 01:02:55.551
- I'm sorry. man.

1672
01:02:55.551 --> 01:02:56.565
I lost it. all right?

1673
01:02:56.565 --> 01:02:57.815
- You see this?

1674
01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:00.810
- $47.000?

1675
01:03:01.916 --> 01:03:02.749
They can't do this.

1676
01:03:02.749 --> 01:03:04.083
We're protected by the First Amendment.

1677
01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:06.811
- They can and they have!

1678
01:03:06.811 --> 01:03:07.695
(Taz scoffs)

1679
01:03:07.695 --> 01:03:09.043
- But we gotta do somethin'.

1680
01:03:09.043 --> 01:03:09.895
We gotta fight this.

1681
01:03:09.895 --> 01:03:11.085
- Pero. guess what?

1682
01:03:11.085 --> 01:03:13.604
We have to get the
people back on our side.

1683
01:03:13.604 --> 01:03:16.623
So you. mister. make it happen.

1684
01:03:16.623 --> 01:03:19.062
Make your magic happen. okay?

1685
01:03:19.062 --> 01:03:20.571
You're on the air in two minutes.

1686
01:03:20.571 --> 01:03:22.071
and don't fuck up.

1687
01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:24.180
(door softly shuts)

1688
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.971
(button shuffling)

1689
01:03:25.971 --> 01:03:27.741
- Welcome back to WGNS.

1690
01:03:27.741 --> 01:03:30.470
This is your man. DJ Taz the Maz.

1691
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:31.675
What's up. all my people out there?

1692
01:03:31.675 --> 01:03:32.998
Listen. I know a lot of you

1693
01:03:32.998 --> 01:03:35.022
don't wanna hear anything I
have to say right about now.

1694
01:03:35.022 --> 01:03:38.067
and I don't blame you.
'cause I failed you.

1695
01:03:38.067 --> 01:03:40.779
In a moment of frustration and a weakness.

1696
01:03:40.779 --> 01:03:44.620
I said some things that
are simply not true.

1697
01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.910
You know. growing up in Detroit.

1698
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.910
I remember. one day.
my mother got into this

1699
01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:51.301
big argument with a
couple of my neighbors.

1700
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:54.451
'cause they told her that
her son was selling drugs.

1701
01:03:54.451 --> 01:03:56.514
Crack to be exact.

1702
01:03:56.514 --> 01:03:58.465
My mother said. "No. not my baby".

1703
01:03:58.465 --> 01:04:00.720
See. she knew that I was innocent.

1704
01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.209
She knew that they were profiling me

1705
01:04:02.209 --> 01:04:03.097
just because I was black.

1706
01:04:03.097 --> 01:04:05.149
But what she didn't know

1707
01:04:05.149 --> 01:04:07.169
is that she was wrong.

1708
01:04:07.169 --> 01:04:08.586
and I was guilty.

1709
01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.349
I'll never forget the look on her face

1710
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:13.747
when I told her the truth.

1711
01:04:13.747 --> 01:04:15.664
Look of disappointment.

1712
01:04:16.878 --> 01:04:18.930
'cause I failed her.

1713
01:04:18.930 --> 01:04:20.513
I failed my family.

1714
01:04:21.749 --> 01:04:22.786
And I promised that day

1715
01:04:22.786 --> 01:04:26.198
never to lie to my family ever again.

1716
01:04:26.198 --> 01:04:28.499
You all are my family.

1717
01:04:28.499 --> 01:04:30.416
I'm sorry I failed you.

1718
01:04:31.739 --> 01:04:33.948
See. I don't care that this is AM radio.

1719
01:04:33.948 --> 01:04:36.588
I don't care that I eat
crappy pizza every day.

1720
01:04:36.588 --> 01:04:38.588
because this is where my heart is.

1721
01:04:38.588 --> 01:04:40.505
This is where I belong.

1722
01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:44.449
Giving the people the truth.

1723
01:04:44.449 --> 01:04:47.146
that is the tradition of radio.

1724
01:04:47.146 --> 01:04:48.140
That's the way it always was.

1725
01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.360
and that's the way it always should be.

1726
01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.478
'Cause without tradition.

1727
01:04:53.478 --> 01:04:56.872
our lives are just as shaky
as a fiddler on a roof.

1728
01:04:56.872 --> 01:05:00.622
Lines are open if you
still wanna talk truth.

1729
01:05:02.067 --> 01:05:03.710
You're on the air with DJ Taz the Maz.

1730
01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:04.543
Who's callin'?

1731
01:05:04.543 --> 01:05:05.376
- [Robby] Hey!

1732
01:05:05.376 --> 01:05:06.512
Hey. man. it's Robby.
(Taz chuckles)

1733
01:05:06.512 --> 01:05:08.093
- Thanks for being part
of the family. Robby.

1734
01:05:08.093 --> 01:05:08.926
- [Robby] Hey. no problem.

1735
01:05:08.926 --> 01:05:10.988
It takes a lot of courage
to tell the truth.

1736
01:05:10.988 --> 01:05:12.093
- It's not for cowards.

1737
01:05:12.093 --> 01:05:14.633
- [Robby] Yeah. but I
bet Antoinette regrets

1738
01:05:14.633 --> 01:05:16.461
losin' a brother like yourself.

1739
01:05:16.461 --> 01:05:18.444
- Well. that's not for us to say.

1740
01:05:18.444 --> 01:05:20.700
Let's just hope that she
moves on with her life.

1741
01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.382
as should I.

1742
01:05:22.382 --> 01:05:23.271
No. we. as humans.

1743
01:05:23.271 --> 01:05:27.463
sometimes. we get so caught up in the past

1744
01:05:27.463 --> 01:05:28.956
that we neglect the present.

1745
01:05:28.956 --> 01:05:30.648
Let the past be the past.

1746
01:05:30.648 --> 01:05:33.182
- [Robby] Yeah. very true.

1747
01:05:33.182 --> 01:05:35.145
You're the man. Taz the Maz!

1748
01:05:35.145 --> 01:05:36.254
We love you. man.

1749
01:05:36.254 --> 01:05:38.050
- Thanks. brother.

1750
01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:39.371
You have a happy early morning.

1751
01:05:39.371 --> 01:05:40.517
- [Robby] You as well.

1752
01:05:40.517 --> 01:05:42.271
(button clicks)

1753
01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:43.562
- [Taz] You've got the line.

1754
01:05:43.562 --> 01:05:45.049
- [Sonya] That's right. I do.

1755
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:46.822
- (chuckles) You know. a couple hours ago.

1756
01:05:46.822 --> 01:05:47.655
I don't think anybody

1757
01:05:47.655 --> 01:05:50.313
would have agreed with me about anything.

1758
01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:53.713
- [Sonya] What you said
about living in the past-

1759
01:05:53.713 --> 01:05:55.634
- What's you name. love?

1760
01:05:55.634 --> 01:05:57.201
- [Sonya] Sonya.

1761
01:05:57.201 --> 01:05:58.824
- Thanks for calling. Sonya.

1762
01:05:58.824 --> 01:05:59.834
- [Sonya] First. I want to say.

1763
01:05:59.834 --> 01:06:01.503
that I accept your apology.

1764
01:06:01.503 --> 01:06:03.131
and that we are all human.

1765
01:06:03.131 --> 01:06:03.964
- That's sweet.

1766
01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:05.201
Thanks for that.

1767
01:06:05.201 --> 01:06:08.480
So what do you have to say
about the past or the present?

1768
01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.962
- [Sonya] Well. sometimes
we live in the past.

1769
01:06:10.962 --> 01:06:14.248
and attach ourselves to moments
that we can't move on from.

1770
01:06:14.248 --> 01:06:15.409
- Well said.

1771
01:06:15.409 --> 01:06:17.043
Any antidotes you'd like to share?

1772
01:06:17.043 --> 01:06:19.699
- [Sonya] Well. let me share
my story with you first.

1773
01:06:19.699 --> 01:06:21.870
My ex-husband was terrible.

1774
01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:23.075
He abused me.

1775
01:06:23.075 --> 01:06:26.069
We lived together for
six years. two children.

1776
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.709
In our last two years of marriage.

1777
01:06:27.709 --> 01:06:28.894
he would come home drunk.

1778
01:06:28.894 --> 01:06:32.513
and beat me up until he left
me unconscious on the floor.

1779
01:06:32.513 --> 01:06:34.399
- I'm sorry you had to live through that.

1780
01:06:34.399 --> 01:06:37.059
- [Sonya] After my
divorce. I was traumatized.

1781
01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:39.051
I didn't want to hear about love.

1782
01:06:39.051 --> 01:06:40.895
I thought men would just hurt me.

1783
01:06:40.895 --> 01:06:42.595
- Yeah. I understand.

1784
01:06:42.595 --> 01:06:44.340
- [Sonya] But you know what. Taz?

1785
01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.315
I was putting myself
behind a protective wall.

1786
01:06:47.315 --> 01:06:50.644
It was fear of loving
and being loved again.

1787
01:06:50.644 --> 01:06:52.443
- Were you able to find love again?

1788
01:06:52.443 --> 01:06:53.593
- [Sonya] Yes. Taz.

1789
01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:54.701
All these years.

1790
01:06:54.701 --> 01:06:56.830
I had my true love in front of me.

1791
01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:58.502
(Taz chuckles)
My best friend.

1792
01:06:58.502 --> 01:06:59.503
- Your best friend?

1793
01:06:59.503 --> 01:07:00.609
(laughs) Okay.

1794
01:07:00.609 --> 01:07:03.442
I thought that only happened
in romantic comedies?

1795
01:07:03.442 --> 01:07:05.194
- [Sonya] He is the best. Taz.

1796
01:07:05.194 --> 01:07:06.693
We talk for hours.

1797
01:07:06.693 --> 01:07:08.972
Lots of laughing until our stomachs hurt.

1798
01:07:08.972 --> 01:07:10.156
He's great to my kids.

1799
01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:11.642
Great conversation.

1800
01:07:11.642 --> 01:07:14.285
We even talk about how many
times we go to the bathroom

1801
01:07:14.285 --> 01:07:16.477
and to make poop jokes.

1802
01:07:16.477 --> 01:07:17.537
- Oh. well. you know.

1803
01:07:17.537 --> 01:07:20.373
that is a very important
part of every relationship.

1804
01:07:20.373 --> 01:07:22.760
The poop talk. the final frontier.

1805
01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.266
(both laughing)

1806
01:07:24.266 --> 01:07:25.099
Now. scat aside.

1807
01:07:25.099 --> 01:07:25.932
I'm happy for you.

1808
01:07:25.932 --> 01:07:27.012
He sounds like a great guy.

1809
01:07:27.012 --> 01:07:28.965
Everybody deserves to be loved.

1810
01:07:28.965 --> 01:07:31.172
- [Sonya] If I had kept
the memories of the past.

1811
01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.996
I would have missed
this incredible present.

1812
01:07:33.996 --> 01:07:37.310
Never let the past determine your future.

1813
01:07:37.310 --> 01:07:38.596
- That is a powerful message.

1814
01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:40.085
Thank you for sharing.

1815
01:07:40.085 --> 01:07:42.526
- [Sonya] I just thought you
might need to hear that. Taz.

1816
01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:43.359
Goodbye.

1817
01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:44.824
- Goodbye. Sonya.

1818
01:07:44.824 --> 01:07:45.657
(button clicks)

1819
01:07:45.657 --> 01:07:49.324
(gentle instrumental music)

1820
01:07:57.593 --> 01:08:00.513
(earphones clattering)

1821
01:08:00.513 --> 01:08:01.693
- [Tony] We lost her.

1822
01:08:01.693 --> 01:08:02.843
- I can't accept that.

1823
01:08:02.843 --> 01:08:04.060
- What does that mean?

1824
01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:05.032
- That means I've gotta find her.

1825
01:08:05.032 --> 01:08:06.698
- [Tony] How?

1826
01:08:06.698 --> 01:08:07.531
- Give me her number.

1827
01:08:07.531 --> 01:08:08.939
- I've tried!

1828
01:08:08.939 --> 01:08:09.772
- And?

1829
01:08:09.772 --> 01:08:10.605
- I got some tow truck company.

1830
01:08:10.605 --> 01:08:12.734
and nobody picks up.

1831
01:08:12.734 --> 01:08:13.818
- There's gotta be a way.

1832
01:08:13.818 --> 01:08:14.752
- There's nothing we can do.

1833
01:08:14.752 --> 01:08:15.873
- No. there's nothing you can do.

1834
01:08:15.873 --> 01:08:17.316
- Oh. okay. okay.

1835
01:08:17.316 --> 01:08:19.235
Oh. what are you gonna do. huh?

1836
01:08:19.235 --> 01:08:20.871
You Sherlock Holmes?

1837
01:08:20.871 --> 01:08:21.705
You the FBI?

1838
01:08:21.705 --> 01:08:22.538
- I don't know.

1839
01:08:22.538 --> 01:08:23.721
I'll think of something.

1840
01:08:23.721 --> 01:08:25.555
- You always say that.

1841
01:08:27.495 --> 01:08:28.648
You're tired.

1842
01:08:28.648 --> 01:08:30.865
Go home and go to sleep.

1843
01:08:30.865 --> 01:08:31.826
Do us all a favor.

1844
01:08:31.826 --> 01:08:34.202
We do it again tomorrow. okay?

1845
01:08:34.202 --> 01:08:35.202
- All right.

1846
01:08:36.282 --> 01:08:39.866
(insects lightly chirping)

1847
01:08:41.396 --> 01:08:43.728
(Taz sighs)

1848
01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:50.385
- [Voice Of Tony] If you
leave now. don't come back.

1849
01:08:50.385 --> 01:08:52.532
- [Voice Of Antoinette]
Galen. I really thought by now

1850
01:08:52.532 --> 01:08:55.960
you'd be some like
big-time music producer.

1851
01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.068
Would never have guessed
you would be an AM-

1852
01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:00.720
- [Voice Of Taz] You and I know.

1853
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.789
- [Voice Of Antoinette] You
became nothing without me.

1854
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:05.519
You'd still be nothing!
(Taz speaks indistinctly)

1855
01:09:05.519 --> 01:09:06.921
- All the frustration.
(Taz moans)

1856
01:09:06.921 --> 01:09:08.014
(interposing voices)

1857
01:09:08.014 --> 01:09:09.124
Self-deprecating remarks.

1858
01:09:09.124 --> 01:09:10.272
- [Voice Of Taz] People don't
wanna know what happened.

1859
01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:11.737
- This is just a dream.
(Taz breathes heavily)

1860
01:09:11.737 --> 01:09:13.178
- I'm the only one-
(female laughs)

1861
01:09:13.178 --> 01:09:14.368
(Taz groans)

1862
01:09:14.368 --> 01:09:17.424
(heavy breathing)

1863
01:09:17.424 --> 01:09:21.058
(Taz clears throat)

1864
01:09:21.058 --> 01:09:23.583
(pills rattling)

1865
01:09:23.583 --> 01:09:26.416
(bottle shuffles)

1866
01:09:33.041 --> 01:09:34.327
(liquid sloshing)

1867
01:09:34.327 --> 01:09:35.388
(Taz exhales loudly)

1868
01:09:35.388 --> 01:09:39.220
(dramatic instrumental music)

1869
01:09:48.703 --> 01:09:51.170
(Taz exhales loudly)

1870
01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:52.162
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1871
01:09:52.162 --> 01:09:55.329
(Taz gags and coughs)

1872
01:09:58.779 --> 01:10:00.266
(groans heavily)

1873
01:10:00.266 --> 01:10:03.599
(coughing and groaning)

1874
01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:13.291
(Taz mumbles indistinctly)

1875
01:10:13.291 --> 01:10:14.999
(objects clattering)

1876
01:10:14.999 --> 01:10:16.081
(glass shatters)

1877
01:10:16.081 --> 01:10:17.376
- Listen. listen. listen.

1878
01:10:17.376 --> 01:10:18.518
This is it. this is it.

1879
01:10:18.518 --> 01:10:20.585
(Taz speaks indistinctly).
because I'm smart.

1880
01:10:20.585 --> 01:10:21.580
I'm sorry.

1881
01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:22.413
Uh. shit.

1882
01:10:24.577 --> 01:10:26.754
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1883
01:10:26.754 --> 01:10:27.587
Huh?

1884
01:10:28.693 --> 01:10:29.829
It's all right.

1885
01:10:29.829 --> 01:10:33.412
(Taz numbles indistinctly)

1886
01:10:35.166 --> 01:10:36.000
Fuck you!

1887
01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:40.708
Fuck it.

1888
01:10:42.172 --> 01:10:43.420
(Taz mumbles indistinctly)

1889
01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.942
(phone chimes)
(Taz grunts)

1890
01:10:44.942 --> 01:10:49.609
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1891
01:10:53.505 --> 01:10:54.434
(Taz sighs)

1892
01:10:54.434 --> 01:10:59.102
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

1893
01:11:04.664 --> 01:11:08.223
(door clatters and creaks open)

1894
01:11:08.223 --> 01:11:11.056
(door slams shut)

1895
01:11:12.053 --> 01:11:13.446
(chair clatters)

1896
01:11:13.446 --> 01:11:14.305
- Que pasa. man?

1897
01:11:14.305 --> 01:11:15.138
- Hey. man.

1898
01:11:15.138 --> 01:11:15.971
Hey. man.
- You look terrible.

1899
01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:16.955
- I know. I know. I know I look terrible.

1900
01:11:16.955 --> 01:11:17.788
Do me a favor. man?

1901
01:11:17.788 --> 01:11:19.455
Cut the fuckin' act.

1902
01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:23.849
- How much have you had?

1903
01:11:23.849 --> 01:11:25.797
- Almost all of it.

1904
01:11:25.797 --> 01:11:27.797
- Can you go on tonight?

1905
01:11:29.416 --> 01:11:31.877
- I'm the Maz. baby.

1906
01:11:31.877 --> 01:11:33.883
- I may have to let you go.

1907
01:11:33.883 --> 01:11:36.867
- (scoffs) Okay.

1908
01:11:36.867 --> 01:11:38.089
- Okay?

1909
01:11:38.089 --> 01:11:40.922
(liquid sloshing)

1910
01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:43.035
- You know what?

1911
01:11:43.035 --> 01:11:43.994
That's okay.

1912
01:11:43.994 --> 01:11:44.827
I don't care about any of it.

1913
01:11:44.827 --> 01:11:45.660
None of it.

1914
01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:47.160
This. Taz the Maz.

1915
01:11:48.628 --> 01:11:49.710
I'm an idiot.

1916
01:11:50.739 --> 01:11:52.656
I'm the idiot who lost.

1917
01:11:55.214 --> 01:11:56.323
- She still may call in.

1918
01:11:56.323 --> 01:11:57.916
- Ah. now. why would she?

1919
01:11:57.916 --> 01:11:59.353
- Because you're a good guy.

1920
01:11:59.353 --> 01:12:00.543
- No. I'm not a good guy.

1921
01:12:00.543 --> 01:12:01.431
I'm an asshole.

1922
01:12:01.431 --> 01:12:04.041
I was an asshole before.

1923
01:12:04.041 --> 01:12:06.625
but I was a successful asshole.

1924
01:12:08.721 --> 01:12:13.638
Wasted my best years on a she
bitch that didn't deserve it.

1925
01:12:15.575 --> 01:12:19.325
and I didn't go after
the one woman that did.

1926
01:12:20.386 --> 01:12:21.219
- Sorry.

1927
01:12:23.275 --> 01:12:25.541
- Why I'd listen to you?

1928
01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.749
- Beats me. but I think you

1929
01:12:27.749 --> 01:12:30.222
are making way too much out of this.

1930
01:12:30.222 --> 01:12:32.295
You don't even know this woman.

1931
01:12:32.295 --> 01:12:34.190
You act like you just broke
up with the love of your life.

1932
01:12:34.190 --> 01:12:36.273
but that's not it. is it?

1933
01:12:39.726 --> 01:12:41.366
It is?

1934
01:12:41.366 --> 01:12:44.582
- I'm in love with a woman I never met.

1935
01:12:44.582 --> 01:12:47.496
She felt closer to me than anymore.

1936
01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:49.235
She wasn't afraid to live in the moment.

1937
01:12:49.235 --> 01:12:51.193
live in the truth.

1938
01:12:51.193 --> 01:12:53.210
Now-
- There are plenty

1939
01:12:53.210 --> 01:12:54.985
of real women out there.

1940
01:12:54.985 --> 01:12:57.458
- No. there are not.

1941
01:12:57.458 --> 01:12:58.541
I've checked.

1942
01:13:00.616 --> 01:13:01.503
It doesn't matter.

1943
01:13:01.503 --> 01:13:02.679
Fuck it.

1944
01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:03.512
Fuck it.

1945
01:13:04.987 --> 01:13:05.820
- Whoa. whoa. whoa!

1946
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:06.653
What are you doing?

1947
01:13:06.653 --> 01:13:07.486
No. no. no.
- Hey. hey!

1948
01:13:07.486 --> 01:13:08.318
- No. no. no. no.
- What does it

1949
01:13:08.318 --> 01:13:09.152
look like I'm doing?

1950
01:13:09.152 --> 01:13:09.985
- No. no. you're not going on.
- Relax.

1951
01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.077
- You're not going on the air drunk.

1952
01:13:11.077 --> 01:13:11.910
- Why?

1953
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:12.743
- [Both] Why?

1954
01:13:12.743 --> 01:13:13.576
- Oh.
- Huh?

1955
01:13:13.576 --> 01:13:15.576
- Why?
- This is it. man.

1956
01:13:16.876 --> 01:13:18.469
I'm at the edge. you know?

1957
01:13:18.469 --> 01:13:19.907
I'm at the edge. man.

1958
01:13:19.907 --> 01:13:20.873
- Okay. well...

1959
01:13:20.873 --> 01:13:22.362
Whoa. whoa. you're not going on drunk.

1960
01:13:22.362 --> 01:13:23.195
- All right.
- That's not how we

1961
01:13:23.195 --> 01:13:24.028
do it at the station.

1962
01:13:24.028 --> 01:13:25.371
It's not gonna happen.

1963
01:13:25.371 --> 01:13:28.103
- Listen. man. I know
what you're thinking.

1964
01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:29.522
I'm desperate.

1965
01:13:29.522 --> 01:13:30.637
Yeah. you're desperate.
- Yeah.

1966
01:13:30.637 --> 01:13:31.502
- and we don't do desperate.
- Yeah.

1967
01:13:31.502 --> 01:13:32.335
- on the air.
- Yeah.

1968
01:13:32.335 --> 01:13:33.835
We need desperate.

1969
01:13:35.566 --> 01:13:39.806
- I don't know about that.
- Listen. listen. listen.

1970
01:13:39.806 --> 01:13:40.728
I'm the man.

1971
01:13:40.728 --> 01:13:41.612
I got this.

1972
01:13:41.612 --> 01:13:44.607
- Oh-
- I can still save us.

1973
01:13:44.607 --> 01:13:49.607
You know. I can stop the
Titanic from sinking (chuckles).

1974
01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.812
If I get her to call.

1975
01:13:51.812 --> 01:13:55.612
I may can wipe clean the
whole Antoinette situation.

1976
01:13:55.612 --> 01:13:56.446
You've gotta trust me.

1977
01:13:56.446 --> 01:13:57.279
You gotta believe in.

1978
01:13:57.279 --> 01:13:59.029
You've gotta understand
I'm DJ Taz the Maz.

1979
01:13:59.029 --> 01:13:59.895
I've got this.

1980
01:13:59.895 --> 01:14:01.118
- Everything's on the line.

1981
01:14:01.118 --> 01:14:01.951
It's up to you.

1982
01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:04.085
I'm gonna give you a shot.

1983
01:14:04.085 --> 01:14:05.502
Don't fuck it up!

1984
01:14:06.536 --> 01:14:07.572
- (Taz speaks in Spanish). man.

1985
01:14:07.572 --> 01:14:08.541
Come on. man.

1986
01:14:08.541 --> 01:14:09.375
Trust me.

1987
01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:10.713
Come on.

1988
01:14:10.713 --> 01:14:11.546
I got this.

1989
01:14:11.546 --> 01:14:12.379
Do me a favor.

1990
01:14:12.379 --> 01:14:13.212
Go get me something.

1991
01:14:13.212 --> 01:14:14.045
You know what I need.

1992
01:14:14.045 --> 01:14:15.406
You know what I need.

1993
01:14:15.406 --> 01:14:19.239
(dramatic instrumental music)

1994
01:14:24.659 --> 01:14:25.840
(button softly clicks)

1995
01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.318
(button shuffles)

1996
01:14:27.318 --> 01:14:28.281
What's up. everybody?

1997
01:14:28.281 --> 01:14:30.781
It's your man. DJ Taz the Maz!

1998
01:14:31.939 --> 01:14:32.821
I'm sure you've heard

1999
01:14:32.821 --> 01:14:35.429
that it's been (mumbles).

2000
01:14:35.429 --> 01:14:37.679
it's been a hell of a week.

2001
01:14:38.605 --> 01:14:39.438
Well...

2002
01:14:47.044 --> 01:14:49.526
(door handle clanks)

2003
01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:50.639
(knocking at door)

2004
01:14:50.639 --> 01:14:51.473
- Taz?

2005
01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:55.567
(knocking at door continues)

2006
01:14:55.567 --> 01:14:56.650
Taz. open up.

2007
01:15:01.502 --> 01:15:02.418
Taz!

2008
01:15:02.418 --> 01:15:03.514
(Taz clears throat)

2009
01:15:03.514 --> 01:15:04.514
- I can't...

2010
01:15:06.011 --> 01:15:08.011
I can't do this anymore.

2011
01:15:10.788 --> 01:15:13.371
It sucks being alone. you know?

2012
01:15:15.064 --> 01:15:18.864
It even sucks when you're around people.

2013
01:15:18.864 --> 01:15:22.059
And I'm trapped in this fish bowl.

2014
01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:25.252
surrounded by all these
lights and gadgets.

2015
01:15:25.252 --> 01:15:27.068
connected to everybody and everyone.

2016
01:15:27.068 --> 01:15:28.736
and I'm still alone.

2017
01:15:32.478 --> 01:15:34.728
(Taz sobs)

2018
01:15:39.514 --> 01:15:40.947
(exhales loudly)

2019
01:15:40.947 --> 01:15:44.447
Forget what I said about love being a lie.

2020
01:15:45.568 --> 01:15:47.429
It's not a lie.

2021
01:15:47.429 --> 01:15:50.610
It's (chuckles)...

2022
01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:54.610
Love reminds us that we
are still alive. mm-hmm.

2023
01:15:57.329 --> 01:16:00.597
And if you can get it from even one woman.

2024
01:16:00.597 --> 01:16:02.797
oh. it'll all be worth it.

2025
01:16:02.797 --> 01:16:05.214
If you can just get that one.

2026
01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:10.143
that one moment of truth and beauty.

2027
01:16:10.143 --> 01:16:12.423
(phone chimes)

2028
01:16:12.423 --> 01:16:13.255
- Come on. come on. come on.

2029
01:16:13.255 --> 01:16:14.089
- [Emergency Operator] 9-1-1.

2030
01:16:14.089 --> 01:16:15.324
What's the emergency?

2031
01:16:15.324 --> 01:16:18.867
- Yeah. I'm at the radio station WGNS.

2032
01:16:18.867 --> 01:16:19.784
- I had it.

2033
01:16:22.124 --> 01:16:23.177
and I did the dumbest thing ever.

2034
01:16:23.177 --> 01:16:24.808
I let it slip.

2035
01:16:24.808 --> 01:16:26.797
I'm flawed. all right?

2036
01:16:26.797 --> 01:16:29.501
I have a lot of problems. I know. I know.

2037
01:16:29.501 --> 01:16:30.885
I'm sorry (speaks indistinctly).

2038
01:16:30.885 --> 01:16:32.811
- Hey. what y'all listenin' to?

2039
01:16:32.811 --> 01:16:33.731
- DJ Taz.

2040
01:16:33.731 --> 01:16:35.475
He's having a mental breakdown.

2041
01:16:35.475 --> 01:16:37.090
- Yeah. well. what else is new?

2042
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:38.480
- No. this is different.

2043
01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.612
Just listen!
- I'm really sorry.

2044
01:16:39.612 --> 01:16:42.438
It's a lot knowing that I had something.

2045
01:16:42.438 --> 01:16:43.375
and I let it go.

2046
01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:46.290
I let it slip away. and that I just...

2047
01:16:46.290 --> 01:16:47.373
I don't know.

2048
01:16:48.293 --> 01:16:49.251
- Who's he talking about?

2049
01:16:49.251 --> 01:16:50.157
Antoinette?

2050
01:16:50.157 --> 01:16:52.954
- No. some woman named Lucy.

2051
01:16:52.954 --> 01:16:54.458
- He said-
- Shh!

2052
01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:58.987
- I had plenty of time.
plenty of opportunities

2053
01:16:58.987 --> 01:17:01.338
to ask Lucy to meet up with me.

2054
01:17:01.338 --> 01:17:02.171
And I should have.

2055
01:17:02.171 --> 01:17:03.004
I should have.

2056
01:17:03.004 --> 01:17:03.837
I don't know why I didn't.

2057
01:17:03.837 --> 01:17:04.670
I just...

2058
01:17:04.670 --> 01:17:05.587
I'm stupid.

2059
01:17:07.128 --> 01:17:10.295
I (exhales loudly)...

2060
01:17:11.373 --> 01:17:13.047
I let a crazy woman.

2061
01:17:13.047 --> 01:17:16.174
and you all know who I'm talking about.

2062
01:17:16.174 --> 01:17:19.554
kick me out inside of myself. you know?

2063
01:17:19.554 --> 01:17:22.361
And I said some stupid things.

2064
01:17:22.361 --> 01:17:26.080
like that I hated talking to you people.

2065
01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.932
The truth is. I did.

2066
01:17:27.932 --> 01:17:32.423
I did hate talking to you
people. until that day.

2067
01:17:32.423 --> 01:17:33.661
the day that she called.

2068
01:17:33.661 --> 01:17:36.704
- Hey. are you finished yet?

2069
01:17:36.704 --> 01:17:39.212
- Yeah. y'all are good to go.

2070
01:17:39.212 --> 01:17:40.045
- Thanks.

2071
01:17:44.056 --> 01:17:45.519
(liquid sloshing)

2072
01:17:45.519 --> 01:17:48.969
- I've been (chuckles)...
(footsteps pattering)

2073
01:17:48.969 --> 01:17:52.053
(objects clattering)

2074
01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.202
(radio garbles)

2075
01:17:57.202 --> 01:18:00.702
I've been drunk and hopped up off of pills

2076
01:18:01.989 --> 01:18:04.782
every day that I've worked here.

2077
01:18:04.782 --> 01:18:06.173
Spillin' out vile. and hate.

2078
01:18:06.173 --> 01:18:11.090
and all the rage that's just
been built up in me for years.

2079
01:18:12.308 --> 01:18:14.058
You know. and I loved

2080
01:18:15.087 --> 01:18:16.974
pissin' on all the
losers that called here.

2081
01:18:16.974 --> 01:18:19.183
It made me feel better than them.

2082
01:18:19.183 --> 01:18:21.100
made me feel important.

2083
01:18:23.972 --> 01:18:26.472
but I was no better than them.

2084
01:18:28.303 --> 01:18:29.657
Worse than them.

2085
01:18:29.657 --> 01:18:30.491
I was...

2086
01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:33.832
I was worse. until she called.

2087
01:18:37.847 --> 01:18:39.514
Lucy. my sweet Lucy.

2088
01:18:42.559 --> 01:18:44.309
I owe you an apology.

2089
01:18:46.739 --> 01:18:49.489
Lucy. I owe you an apology. Lucy.

2090
01:18:50.931 --> 01:18:53.907
because I said that I hated being here.

2091
01:18:53.907 --> 01:18:55.439
and I hated talking to

2092
01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:59.276
all the freaks. and geeks. and losers.

2093
01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:00.109
And it's true.

2094
01:19:00.109 --> 01:19:02.043
I mean. I did.

2095
01:19:02.043 --> 01:19:03.156
But that was before you.

2096
01:19:03.156 --> 01:19:06.437
before you showed me that I wasn't alone.

2097
01:19:06.437 --> 01:19:07.603
You know. I...

2098
01:19:09.844 --> 01:19:11.989
That there was somebody I could talk to.

2099
01:19:11.989 --> 01:19:14.406
you know. that understood me.

2100
01:19:15.771 --> 01:19:18.521
that maybe. maybe cares about me.

2101
01:19:23.392 --> 01:19:24.571
(Taz groans and sniffs)

2102
01:19:24.571 --> 01:19:26.896
I have a lot of problems (laughs).

2103
01:19:26.896 --> 01:19:27.896
I know that.

2104
01:19:29.226 --> 01:19:32.643
But maybe my problems and your problems.

2105
01:19:34.963 --> 01:19:38.228
we could've figured 'em out together

2106
01:19:38.228 --> 01:19:41.424
over some of those Italian
roles you were talking about.

2107
01:19:41.424 --> 01:19:44.835
Yeah (chuckles).

2108
01:19:44.835 --> 01:19:49.157
I mean. there has to be
a point to all this. yes?

2109
01:19:49.157 --> 01:19:50.696
I don't know if it's God.

2110
01:19:50.696 --> 01:19:53.460
or faith. or whatever
that brought us together.

2111
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.947
It had to be for reason.

2112
01:19:55.947 --> 01:20:00.626
Perhaps. it made all of
this worth it. you know?

2113
01:20:00.626 --> 01:20:01.916
Has to be.

2114
01:20:01.916 --> 01:20:03.906
Perhaps. I was wrong.

2115
01:20:03.906 --> 01:20:05.462
and there is no God. there is no faith.

2116
01:20:05.462 --> 01:20:07.496
Nothing is important.

2117
01:20:07.496 --> 01:20:09.046
I don't even know if
you're listening right now.

2118
01:20:09.046 --> 01:20:10.816
Probably aren't.

2119
01:20:10.816 --> 01:20:13.017
You probably got wise.
and said. you know what?

2120
01:20:13.017 --> 01:20:14.439
I'm not callin' this fool anymore.

2121
01:20:14.439 --> 01:20:17.120
Why talk to a loser like him?

2122
01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.870
(exhales loudly)

2123
01:20:22.922 --> 01:20:24.172
Let's find out.

2124
01:20:25.678 --> 01:20:27.762
(Taz sniffs)

2125
01:20:27.762 --> 01:20:28.594
(button softly clicks)

2126
01:20:28.594 --> 01:20:29.743
(button shuffles)

2127
01:20:29.743 --> 01:20:31.550
You're on the air.

2128
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:33.300
- [Susan] Hello. Taz.

2129
01:20:34.143 --> 01:20:35.969
- You're not Lucy.

2130
01:20:35.969 --> 01:20:36.805
- [Susan] I am not.

2131
01:20:36.805 --> 01:20:37.983
My name is Susan.

2132
01:20:37.983 --> 01:20:39.233
- Hello. Susan.

2133
01:20:40.452 --> 01:20:41.968
- [Susan] You don't sound well. Taz.

2134
01:20:41.968 --> 01:20:43.012
- Yeah. I'm fuckin' fantastic.

2135
01:20:43.012 --> 01:20:43.991
Haven't you been listening?

2136
01:20:43.991 --> 01:20:44.824
- [Susan] I have.

2137
01:20:44.824 --> 01:20:46.429
- Then why'd you call?

2138
01:20:46.429 --> 01:20:49.602
- [Susan] Tony asked me to call.

2139
01:20:49.602 --> 01:20:50.469
- Who are you. Susan?

2140
01:20:50.469 --> 01:20:51.413
What do you do?

2141
01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:53.166
- [Susan] I am a counselor.

2142
01:20:53.166 --> 01:20:54.391
- What do you counsel on?

2143
01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:55.311
- [Susan] I think you know.

2144
01:20:55.311 --> 01:20:56.901
- You don't wanna tell me?

2145
01:20:56.901 --> 01:20:58.263
- [Susan] Taz. you know you've got people

2146
01:20:58.263 --> 01:21:00.112
who really care about you.

2147
01:21:00.112 --> 01:21:01.848
Tony looks at you like a brother.

2148
01:21:01.848 --> 01:21:03.101
- (scoffs) Tony?

2149
01:21:03.101 --> 01:21:04.991
Tony. Tony. Tony. yeah.

2150
01:21:04.991 --> 01:21:07.342
Tony is the boss here.
ladies and gentlemen.

2151
01:21:07.342 --> 01:21:12.121
He's the one who allows
me to go on every night.

2152
01:21:12.121 --> 01:21:13.411
(sighs loudly)

2153
01:21:13.411 --> 01:21:15.161
You know what?

2154
01:21:15.161 --> 01:21:16.077
I'm hungry.

2155
01:21:17.341 --> 01:21:20.063
I think it's time for that last supper.

2156
01:21:20.063 --> 01:21:22.321
- [Susan] Last supper of the day. right.

2157
01:21:22.321 --> 01:21:24.737
(Taz laughs)

2158
01:21:27.559 --> 01:21:28.727
- You're good.

2159
01:21:29.949 --> 01:21:32.891
- [Susan] What do you
want to eat now. Taz?

2160
01:21:32.891 --> 01:21:34.550
- [Taz] Some Italian rolls.

2161
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:36.111
- [Susan] Do you have any of them?

2162
01:21:36.111 --> 01:21:37.528
- Nah.

2163
01:21:37.528 --> 01:21:39.269
No. all we have is crap.

2164
01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:40.936
- [Susan] Like what?

2165
01:21:42.413 --> 01:21:44.427
- Mm-kay. you're good.

2166
01:21:44.427 --> 01:21:45.260
Buying time.

2167
01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:46.093
I see you. I see you.

2168
01:21:46.093 --> 01:21:47.456
Okay.

2169
01:21:47.456 --> 01:21:49.563
(gun clanks)
(button softly clicks)

2170
01:21:49.563 --> 01:21:50.478
Let's see. what do we have?

2171
01:21:50.478 --> 01:21:51.312
What do we have?

2172
01:21:51.312 --> 01:21:56.312
We have (sniffs) candy. you
know. crackers. cold pizza.

2173
01:21:59.091 --> 01:22:01.424
- [Susan] I like cold pizza.

2174
01:22:03.362 --> 01:22:04.446
- Cold pizza?

2175
01:22:05.904 --> 01:22:07.212
You kiddin'?

2176
01:22:07.212 --> 01:22:08.295
- [Susan] No.

2177
01:22:09.653 --> 01:22:12.205
- See. that's the problem
with this country.

2178
01:22:12.205 --> 01:22:13.038
the whole world.

2179
01:22:13.038 --> 01:22:14.254
People like you.

2180
01:22:14.254 --> 01:22:15.337
- [Susan] What did I do?

2181
01:22:15.337 --> 01:22:16.933
- (scoffs) Eat a cold pizza.

2182
01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:18.741
Pizza is meant to be eatin' hot.

2183
01:22:18.741 --> 01:22:20.880
Eating cold pizza is a crime.

2184
01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.128
- [Susan] People can do what they want.

2185
01:22:22.128 --> 01:22:23.173
It's a free country.

2186
01:22:23.173 --> 01:22:24.201
- No. it's not a free country!

2187
01:22:24.201 --> 01:22:25.364
It's not a free country.

2188
01:22:25.364 --> 01:22:26.673
Nothing is free in this country.

2189
01:22:26.673 --> 01:22:27.835
not even dyin'.

2190
01:22:27.835 --> 01:22:29.516
- [Susan] No one has said
anything about about dying.

2191
01:22:29.516 --> 01:22:30.349
- I'm sayin' it!

2192
01:22:30.349 --> 01:22:32.349
I'm saying it right now!

2193
01:22:33.303 --> 01:22:35.199
You die. huh?

2194
01:22:35.199 --> 01:22:38.617
A funeral casket. grave. $9.000.

2195
01:22:38.617 --> 01:22:40.477
$9.000 just to die.

2196
01:22:40.477 --> 01:22:41.975
That's if you want a grave at all.

2197
01:22:41.975 --> 01:22:43.629
You get cremated. pff. drops the bill down

2198
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:45.611
about 6. $7.000 just to die!

2199
01:22:45.611 --> 01:22:47.347
- [Susan] But no one is dying now.

2200
01:22:47.347 --> 01:22:48.456
- No. statistically speaking.

2201
01:22:48.456 --> 01:22:49.746
somebody is dying right now.

2202
01:22:49.746 --> 01:22:50.986
Bam. dead!

2203
01:22:50.986 --> 01:22:52.014
You're dead!

2204
01:22:52.014 --> 01:22:53.054
She's dead!

2205
01:22:53.054 --> 01:22:54.188
Right now!

2206
01:22:54.188 --> 01:22:55.146
Huh?

2207
01:22:55.146 --> 01:22:57.815
That's the story of the world.

2208
01:22:57.815 --> 01:23:01.065
one funeral possession after the other.

2209
01:23:01.974 --> 01:23:04.602
What's the problem with one more.

2210
01:23:04.602 --> 01:23:07.072
- [Susan] I can think of several reasons.

2211
01:23:07.072 --> 01:23:08.138
(banging at door)
(Taz breathes heavily)

2212
01:23:08.138 --> 01:23:08.971
- [Officer] Open the door.

2213
01:23:08.971 --> 01:23:09.804
It's the police.

2214
01:23:09.804 --> 01:23:11.261
- Ah. shit. they found me.

2215
01:23:11.261 --> 01:23:12.448
(Taz breathes shakily)
- Who found you?

2216
01:23:12.448 --> 01:23:14.343
- The popo. the fuzz.
the cops. they're here.

2217
01:23:14.343 --> 01:23:15.289
(banging on door)
- Right now. son.

2218
01:23:15.289 --> 01:23:16.288
- You'll never take me alive!

2219
01:23:16.288 --> 01:23:17.121
- [Officer] Open the door.

2220
01:23:17.121 --> 01:23:18.168
It's the police.

2221
01:23:18.168 --> 01:23:19.001
- Come on already!

2222
01:23:19.001 --> 01:23:20.764
(male speaks indistinctly)

2223
01:23:20.764 --> 01:23:21.597
I'm ready!

2224
01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:22.430
Come on!

2225
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:23.263
(banging on door)

2226
01:23:23.263 --> 01:23:24.862
(Taz breathes heavily)

2227
01:23:24.862 --> 01:23:25.696
- [Susan] Taz?

2228
01:23:25.696 --> 01:23:26.996
Are you there. Taz?

2229
01:23:26.996 --> 01:23:28.570
(phone receiver clatters)

2230
01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.607
(muffled indistinct chattering)

2231
01:23:30.607 --> 01:23:33.687
(intense dramatic music)

2232
01:23:33.687 --> 01:23:35.826
- What's goin' on out there?

2233
01:23:35.826 --> 01:23:39.639
(muffled indistinct chattering continues)

2234
01:23:39.639 --> 01:23:41.347
(alarm buzzing)

2235
01:23:41.347 --> 01:23:44.304
Who is it?
(door creaks open)

2236
01:23:44.304 --> 01:23:47.221
(Taz sighs loudly)

2237
01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:49.700
Lucy?

2238
01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:50.532
- It's me.

2239
01:23:51.576 --> 01:23:54.826
(Taz breathes shakily)

2240
01:23:56.690 --> 01:23:58.514
- Were you listening?

2241
01:23:58.514 --> 01:23:59.348
- I was.

2242
01:24:01.732 --> 01:24:04.815
(Taz exhales loudly)

2243
01:24:07.273 --> 01:24:09.294
- How'd you get here?

2244
01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:11.210
- I drove in my Camaro.

2245
01:24:12.545 --> 01:24:14.150
- What year?

2246
01:24:14.150 --> 01:24:14.983
- '79.

2247
01:24:16.011 --> 01:24:17.380
- Nice ride.

2248
01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:20.048
(Lucy chuckles)

2249
01:24:23.748 --> 01:24:25.748
What are you doing here?

2250
01:24:26.773 --> 01:24:27.780
- I'm starving.

2251
01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:29.800
I was wondering. do you want to step out

2252
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:31.094
and get some rolls?

2253
01:24:31.094 --> 01:24:32.277
- Yes.

2254
01:24:32.277 --> 01:24:35.943
(gentle instrumental music)

2255
01:24:37.454 --> 01:24:38.287
Yep.

2256
01:24:40.082 --> 01:24:43.059
(Taz breathes shakily)

2257
01:24:43.059 --> 01:24:45.809
(exhales loudly)

2258
01:24:48.325 --> 01:24:52.825
(gentle instrumental music continues)

2259
01:24:57.716 --> 01:25:00.273

2260
01:25:00.273 --> 01:25:04.773
