00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.734
[singsongy] Already done!

00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:42.955
Hey. everyone! I just arrived
at my bestie Hanna's house.

7
00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:46.481
I'm so excited to tell you guys
all about this trip! [kisses]

8
00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:50.180
Wait. why are you guys
recording this?

9
00:00:50.224 --> 00:00:53.053
We don't have to document
anything before we get there...

10
00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:54.054
Followers need their click-bait.

11
00:00:56.143 --> 00:00:58.971
No. not you. I know
you're like Insta-Royalty
or something stupid like that.

12
00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:01.713
I'm talking about these dopes.

13
00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:04.194
[Brad] We have to
document everything.

14
00:01:04.238 --> 00:01:07.371
Professor Daus says we get extra
credit if we do a presentation
on the entire journey.

15
00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:09.025
not just the site itself.

16
00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.766
You want that extra credit.
right?

17
00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:12.855
-I'll take it.
-[Brad] All right!

18
00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:17.338
Our findings may someday shape
the course of human history!

Don't roll your eyes at me.
Berry. This is legit!

20
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.259

21
00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:27.739

assignment!

22
00:01:27.783 --> 00:01:30.177
[laughing]
I'm not editing that out!

23
00:01:31.178 --> 00:01:33.745
[Brad] Ah. shit. I gotta pee.

24
00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.486
All right! Hey. dude. Hurry up.

25
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.662
We want to make our first
camping spot before night.

26
00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:40.143
-Okay. it will take two seconds!
-[Jay] All right.

27
00:01:41.144 --> 00:01:42.624

[Brad humming]

29

[Hanna] Oh. God!

00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:56.246
-Hey. Brad.
[Brad] Hey.

31
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.032

33
00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:05.125
It'll be. uh. scary! [laughs]

34
00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:09.129
-Oh. she's ready.
-[Jay] Look at these two.

35
00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:13.437
-[Mia] Love is in the air!
-[Jay] Is that what I smell?

36
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:15.961
Nope. I just farted.

37
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:17.615
Oh. my God!

38
00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:20.879
Are you. are you filming me?

39
00:02:20.923 --> 00:02:23.491
[Brad] Yeah. sorry.
Can I take a piss real quick?

40
00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:25.057
Yeah. of course.
You know where it is.

41
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:28.017
Thanks... I'll go...
I'll go... hey!

42
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.411
-[laughs] I'm going to go
this way.
-Yeah. yeah. okay.

43
00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:38.027
What the hell is Hanna doing?

44
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.508
[Jay] Looks like she's
waiting on him to take a piss.

45
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:41.857
[blows horn]

46
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.120

Just leave him the keys!

[Brad] On today's episode
of Camping with Brad.
proper hydration.

49
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.738
Now proper hydration is
essential when going
on long excursions.

50
00:02:53.782 --> 00:02:55.827
The color of your urine
is really what you'll--

51
00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:58.221
-[Hanna] Hey. Brad?
-Yo!

52
00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:02.182
I'm leaving the keys in the door
for you. so just lock it
when you come out please.

53
00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:03.487
Okay?

54
00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:05.054
-No problemo!
-Thanks.

55
00:03:06.447 --> 00:03:09.754
Now this. this is not the color
you want to see.

56
00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:13.802
Oh. my God. Let's go.

57
00:03:19.851 --> 00:03:21.505
Where should I put my backpack?

58
00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.857
[Jay] Ah. you have to hold it
in your lap. Sorry.

59
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:28.773
-[Berry] Hanna. what up.

Tight fit. guys!

61
00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:33.822
[Jay] Sorry. I wasn't able
to get my uncle's SUV

62
00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:36.259
so we're stuck
in Berry's clown car.

63
00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:37.347
[Brad sighs]

64
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.312
We can switch who says shotgun
if you need more leg room.

65
00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:47.792
Or you guys can just get out
and walk if you prefer.

66
00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:49.620
No. I'm good. actually. Mia.

67
00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:51.883
if you want me to sit
in the middle.
I'm totally fine with that.

68
00:03:51.927 --> 00:03:54.059
No! I have to make sure
Brad doesn't try anything
with you!

69
00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:55.235
[Brad] Sorry!

70
00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:57.106
What if I want him to?

71
00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:02.198
[Brad] [exhales]
All right. what did I miss?

72
00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.678
-Did you lock the door?
-Yep!

73
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:05.810
Okay. can I snag my keys back
from you?

74
00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:08.726
Oh. I just left them
in the door...

75
00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:12.730
I'm not falling for that. Brad.
Just give me the keys!

82
00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:46.677
[Jay] Wow. that really
didn't take long. huh?

83
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:49.332
[Berry] Not in the car. man.
I really don't want to get
pulled over.

84
00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:51.160
[Hanna] Oh. my gosh.
you guys are such squares.

It's okay.

88
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.604
Haters gonna hate.

89
00:05:00.648 --> 00:05:03.346
[Brad] Hatters gonna hate? Wow!

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.435
-That's a good line!
-[Hanna] Yeah.

91
00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.394
Oh. it's a great line!

92
00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:13.661
[Brad] Jay. Jay what do you
got there. buddy?
Is that a. uh. treasure map?

93
00:05:13.704 --> 00:05:15.750
[Jay] Yes. this is

94
00:05:15.793 --> 00:05:18.100
[Mia] Yeah. is that our

95
00:05:18.143 --> 00:05:20.450
Jay. is this your first time

97
00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:23.148
That's so cute!

98
00:05:24.193 --> 00:05:25.629
I have a trail app we can use.

99
00:05:25.673 --> 00:05:27.718
Yeah. why don't we just
use our phones. Jay?

100
00:05:27.762 --> 00:05:30.330
No! Did you guys get
the email I sent?

101
00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:34.203
All the reviews say
there is no cell service
on this trail. at all!

102
00:05:34.246 --> 00:05:36.031
-[Mia] What?
-[Hanna] Damn

103
00:05:36.074 --> 00:05:38.947
-[Jay] Sorry. Social media
will have to wait.

104
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.690

[Brad] Nice.

110
00:05:56.573 --> 00:05:58.706
We are hiking to a
Native American village.

111
00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:03.101
Legend says that the village
was destroyed
by a timeless evil.

112
00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:04.625
[Berry] The white man!

113

We're gonna be off the grid
and it's going to be
so exciting!

115
00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:12.328
It's a couple days hike in
so I brought plenty
of provisions

116
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.462
including but not limited to
solar powered phone chargers...

117
00:06:15.505 --> 00:06:18.682
-[Berry] I'll take that.
-...so we can document
the whole experience.

118
00:06:18.726 --> 00:06:22.120
-Also. we have a--
-A shit ton of weed!

119
00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:24.340
Bye. everyone! [laughs]

120
00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:27.256
Thanks. Brad. now everyone is
going to think I'm a pothead!

121
00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:28.649
[Brad] What's wrong with that?

122
00:06:30.302 --> 00:06:31.608
-There's worse things--
-[Mia] They'll think
I'm like you.

123
00:06:31.652 --> 00:06:33.828
that's what's wrong with that!

124
00:06:33.871 --> 00:06:35.656

[Hanna] Mia. what is that for?

166
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.407
It's just for police
and Park Rangers and stuff.

167
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:45.410
If we aren't back by the date.
they'll hopefully...
[clicks tongue]

168
00:09:45.454 --> 00:09:46.890
come looking for us.

169
00:09:46.934 --> 00:09:49.371
What you mean hopefully?
That's their job. right?

170
00:09:49.414 --> 00:09:53.549
[Mia] Yes. If we aren't back.
they'll come looking for us.
No doubt.

171
00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:58.119
[Hanna] And we will be back
because we have the original
Lewis and Clark map with us.

172
00:09:58.162 --> 00:09:59.990
[Jay] Laugh it up now.

173
00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:03.646
You'll be happy we have this
when your phone loses service!

174
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.821
Trust me.

175
00:10:07.737 --> 00:10:09.086
[Berry] Thank you. sir.

176
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.087
[scoffs]

177
00:10:11.001 --> 00:10:12.176
[lighter sparkling]

178
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.788
-Wow.
-[Brad] What?

179
00:10:14.831 --> 00:10:16.790
-We're not in the car anymore!
-[Mia] Mm-Hm.

180
00:10:18.443 --> 00:10:19.619
[Hanna] Thank You.

181
00:10:23.448 --> 00:10:25.450
-[Hanna] Jay?
-Thank you.

182
00:10:25.494 --> 00:10:27.278
[Brad] You're gonna need to
light it again. my man.

183
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.022
-Get up in there.
-Yeah.

184
00:10:35.025 --> 00:10:38.028
No thanks.
I'm not putting that in my body!

185
00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:41.249
Your body is your temple.
You should respect it.

186
00:10:41.292 --> 00:10:43.730
[Brad] Yes. my body
is a temple...

187
00:10:43.773 --> 00:10:48.169
To the God of weed!
Weed. Weed. Weed.

188
00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:52.782
[lighter sparkling]

189
00:10:52.826 --> 00:10:54.654
-[Jay] Hey. guys.
check this out!
-[Berry] Yeah?

190
00:11:02.052 --> 00:11:03.184
[Mia] Hanna.

191
00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:09.625
[Jay] Told you!

192
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:12.802
Service. no service.
service. no service

193
00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:14.586
[Mia] That's creepy.
I don't like that.

194
00:11:15.544 --> 00:11:16.632
[Mia sighs]

195
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.725
-[Berry] Are you done
screwing around with it?
-[Jay] Yeah.

196
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.816
-Let's go do some hiking
activities!
-Let's do it.

197
00:11:33.127 --> 00:11:35.042
[Berry] I guess that would
just be hiking right?

198
00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:37.174
-[Mia] Yes.
-[Hanna] Probably.

199
00:11:38.785 --> 00:11:40.177
[blowing]

200
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:41.918
[Brad] What. uh. what's
going on there. Hanna?

201
00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:45.356
-It's not working.
-It's definitely not working.

202
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.228
Everyone. she's in trouble!

203
00:11:47.271 --> 00:11:48.403
Help!

204
00:11:49.491 --> 00:11:50.710
Get going!

205
00:11:55.062 --> 00:11:56.628
[Berry] I believe in you!

206
00:12:00.937 --> 00:12:02.634
Dismount.

207
00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:04.549
[grunting] Okay.

208
00:12:04.593 --> 00:12:06.377
[Hanna] Nope. nope.

209
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.556
The thing about it is...
you gotta respect the rock.

210
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.123
-You got it.
-You gotta respect it.

211
00:12:13.167 --> 00:12:16.083
-Sacred rock!
-Brad] Exactly. Don't. don't.

212
00:12:16.126 --> 00:12:18.999
-Or stoners rock in Brad's case.
-I totally respect that.

213
00:12:19.042 --> 00:12:22.742
-You won't be able to!
-Look at him! Spiderman!

214
00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:26.571
Oh. well. I could do it...
that way I could do it...

215
00:12:26.615 --> 00:12:28.530
So how does that make you feel?

216
00:12:28.573 --> 00:12:30.793
He did... he cheat...
He did it a cheat...
a cheating way.

217
00:12:30.837 --> 00:12:34.231
-Yeah? Okay. sure.
-I did.

218
00:12:34.275 --> 00:12:37.017
So I could do it that way.

219
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.801
If it was that way.
I could do it.

220
00:12:38.845 --> 00:12:40.498
[Hanna] Okay.

221
00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:41.804
You should try...
I mean...

222
00:12:41.848 --> 00:12:43.153
[Brad] Alright. alright.
scoot over.

223
00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:44.720
Moral support is up here.

224
00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.591
I'm going to show off
my gymnastic skills.

225
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:50.160
-Wait. what's over there?
-No. no. no.

226
00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.251
-Look at that!
-Oh. my gosh! You made it!

227
00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:57.254
-[Jay] Hey. that's one way.
-I told you.

228
00:12:57.298 --> 00:13:03.304
[indistinct chatter]

229
00:13:19.059 --> 00:13:20.930
[Brad] Take care of that.

230
00:13:20.974 --> 00:13:22.758
[Hanna] Not in this shorts.

231
00:13:26.544 --> 00:13:30.722
-[Brad] You need a hand?
Of course not!
-[Mia] I'll be fine.

232
00:13:30.766 --> 00:13:32.072
[Berry] I'm not sure
how they mate.

233
00:13:32.115 --> 00:13:34.074
[snake hissing]

234
00:13:34.117 --> 00:13:36.032
[Jay] You see that?
It's moving!

235
00:13:38.818 --> 00:13:42.952
[snake hissing and rattling]

236
00:13:51.743 --> 00:13:53.397
[birds chirping]

237
00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:04.104
[Brad] He's coiling up.
Let's go.

238
00:14:04.147 --> 00:14:06.715
[Berry] Yeah. we should
take a step back.

239
00:14:11.502 --> 00:14:14.941
[Berry] Hey. Brad. Brad.
Hey. Brad. how was your poop?

240
00:14:14.984 --> 00:14:17.160
[Brad] Well. good thing
I had that dollar bill.

241
00:14:22.165 --> 00:14:23.775
Wow!

242

[Brad] Boo!

247
00:14:41.968 --> 00:14:43.926
[Jay] Try not to fall off. Brad.

248
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.581
[Mia] Yeah. wouldn't
want you to fall...

249
00:14:46.624 --> 00:14:48.104
[Hanna] Please don't fall.

250
00:14:49.062 --> 00:14:51.586
-[Berry] You should jump.
-[Brad] Eh. if I fall I fall.

251
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:54.632
-[Hanna] [laughs] That's
a terrible attitude to have.
-[Brad] It's the will of nature!

252
00:14:55.851 --> 00:15:00.160
[Jay] Ah. this man's been
smoking J's all the way up here.

253

-[Brad] Really? Really?

256
00:15:08.472 --> 00:15:10.953
-That's all you got in ya?
-[Berry] Don't fail me!

257
00:15:10.997 --> 00:15:14.391
[Jay] We're floating.
we're flying. Professor Daus!

258
00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:17.133
[Brad] No marijuana was harmed
in the making
of this production.

259
00:15:21.268 --> 00:15:23.096
-[Brad] Nicely done!
-[Hanna] Okay. Jay. your turn!

-Having a blast
with my pretty lady.
-So much fun!

267
00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:44.726
The views are almost
as beautiful as we are.

268
00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:46.597
-Almost.
-Almost. not quite.

269
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:47.990
Almost.

270
00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:50.819
[giggling]

271
00:15:50.862 --> 00:15:53.865

What's up. what's up.

274
00:15:58.174 --> 00:15:59.741
[Berry] You want to
pick up that bottle?

275
00:15:59.784 --> 00:16:01.830
Nature will clean it up. bro.

276
00:16:01.873 --> 00:16:03.875
It's not bio-degradable.

277
00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:05.268
Who are you guys PETA?

278
00:16:05.312 --> 00:16:08.315
[Hanna] PETA protects animals...

279
00:16:08.358 --> 00:16:11.057
Whatever. If want to
pick up the bottle. pick it up.

280
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.406
Or you can pick it up.

281
00:16:12.449 --> 00:16:14.277
-Or you can make me pick it up.
-I can.

282
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:18.281
Okay. guys. stop it.
Gosh. it's just one bottle.

283
00:16:19.674 --> 00:16:23.243
Okay! There we go!

284
00:16:23.286 --> 00:16:27.508
Now it's picked up.
It's really not a big deal.

285
00:16:27.551 --> 00:16:29.423
Gosh. there's so much
testosterone around here...

286
00:16:29.466 --> 00:16:33.340
Yeah. okay guys. sorry.
are you guys coming
from the ruins?

287
00:16:33.383 --> 00:16:34.906
[man 2] Yeah.
They were lame though.

288
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.344
[Brad] Cool.
that's where we're heading.

289
00:16:37.387 --> 00:16:41.696
If I was you. I'd turn around
and go home
'cause they suck.

290
00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:44.220
Or better yet. why don't the
three of you guys head home

291
00:16:44.264 --> 00:16:47.963
-and leave these two
fine-ass ladies with us!
-[slaps Mia's butt]

292
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:50.835
-Oh. my God!
-[man 2] What the fuck?

293
00:16:51.706 --> 00:16:53.534
[man 2] Hey. you assholes
are going to pay for that!

294
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:06.242
[Mia] And our alpha male here
got punched in the nose
defending my honor.

295
00:17:07.504 --> 00:17:08.679
[laughs]

296
00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:10.203
You alright?

297
00:17:10.246 --> 00:17:11.813
You should see
the other guys.

298
00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:13.336
They were such wimps.

299
00:17:14.816 --> 00:17:16.426
Hey. we got to keep moving.
guys.

300
00:17:17.993 --> 00:17:21.388
Anybody else think we've
gone far enough for today?

301
00:17:21.431 --> 00:17:24.782
Nah. we got like about
three more miles
till we reach our first camp.

302
00:17:24.826 --> 00:17:26.436
so... chop. chop.

303
00:17:28.786 --> 00:17:30.266
[Hanna] Seriously. dude?

304
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.228
[Mia] Here we go.

305
00:17:36.142 --> 00:17:37.360
[Brad] Slow down!

306
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.192
[Berry] Thanks for helping. Jay.
I appreciate it.

307
00:17:44.324 --> 00:17:45.673
[Jay] No problem.

308
00:17:47.979 --> 00:17:49.764
[Hanna] Oh. my God!
He's so cute!

309
00:17:49.807 --> 00:17:51.548
-Mia!
-[Jay] Look at him!

310
00:17:51.592 --> 00:17:53.028
[Hanna]
Mia. come check this out!

311
00:17:54.334 --> 00:17:59.121
[Mia] Oh. it's a tortoise!
I love tortoises!

312
00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:02.168
[Jay] He chillin'. Is he alive?

313
00:18:02.211 --> 00:18:04.605
[Hanna] Oh. my gosh!
He's so cute.
Look at him hiding.

314
00:18:04.648 --> 00:18:06.868
[Mia] Just walk around him.
maybe we should make sure

315
00:18:06.911 --> 00:18:10.045
he's out of the way of wherever
everyone's walking.

316
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:15.398
[Jay] So along our route.
we have our camping location
here indicated by this circle.

317
00:18:15.442 --> 00:18:20.534
Our final destination
is another day's hike
indicated here by this X.

318
00:18:20.577 --> 00:18:23.189
The plan is to camp in the ruins
for a night

319
00:18:23.232 --> 00:18:26.844
and then hike the same way
back to the camping location.

320
00:18:26.888 --> 00:18:30.239
You see this here?

321
00:18:30.283 --> 00:18:34.591
This is the mountain's face.
so. guys...

322
00:18:34.635 --> 00:18:37.551
we've reached our first
camping spot!

323
00:18:37.594 --> 00:18:39.814
[cheers]

324
00:18:39.857 --> 00:18:43.165
Dude. it looks exactly the same
as the spot
we wanted to stop at before.

325
00:18:43.209 --> 00:18:46.125
Yeah. Oh. wait.
no it doesn't at all.

326
00:18:46.168 --> 00:18:48.953
Berry. go sit on a cactus.
all right.

327
00:18:49.867 --> 00:18:52.305
-Words hurt. words hurt. man.
words hurt.
-That was aggressive. I'm sorry.

328
00:18:52.348 --> 00:18:55.743
It's not about the location.
it's about how far we've gone.

329
00:18:55.786 --> 00:19:00.226
[Jay] Thank you. Mia.
We divided the distance
by how many days.

330
00:19:00.269 --> 00:19:03.011
Besides maybe if you weren't
filling your lungs with smoke
all the time.

331
00:19:03.054 --> 00:19:05.970
-it'd be a little easier.
-Ah. gee. thanks. mom.

332
00:19:07.798 --> 00:19:12.716
Alright. I vote the women
stay here. clean it up.

333
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.414
get the tents up.
all that good stuff.

334
00:19:14.457 --> 00:19:15.806
while the men go find firewood.

335
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:17.417
Oh. that's not sexist at all...

336
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.202
-Maybe kill a squirrel.
Who knows?
-What?

337
00:19:21.247 --> 00:19:23.597
-I don't know.
-We're in the desert...

338
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.946
-A desert squirrel.
-Oh.

339
00:19:24.989 --> 00:19:26.426
[coughs] Sexist.

340
00:19:26.469 --> 00:19:28.776
[Brad] Welcome to
Camping with Brad.

341
00:19:28.819 --> 00:19:31.779
On today's episode. the males
have been sent from camp
to gather timber.

342
00:19:33.955 --> 00:19:36.740
The females stay behind
to build shelter

343
00:19:36.784 --> 00:19:39.917
and presumably prepare their
bodies for the rough intercourse

344
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:44.879
that's likely to occur when the
beastly males return
and need sexual release.

345
00:19:44.922 --> 00:19:49.100
[Jay] [laughs]
Dude. what the hell? Eww.

346
00:19:49.144 --> 00:19:51.581
[Brad] Oh. what's this?
A rare sight.

347
00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:54.323
The alpha is
marking his territory!

348
00:19:54.367 --> 00:19:56.499
Enemies. approach
at your own peril.

349
00:19:56.543 --> 00:19:58.371
[Berry] I can't go
with you watching me.

350
00:19:58.414 --> 00:20:00.111
-[Brad] Though his penis
is small...
-What the hell are you doing?

351
00:20:00.155 --> 00:20:03.114
...his muscles
have made him alpha!

352
00:20:03.158 --> 00:20:04.681
Ah! The alpha is charging!

353
00:20:52.207 --> 00:20:54.601
[birds chirping]

354
00:20:56.124 --> 00:20:58.518
[light sparkling]

355
00:21:00.346 --> 00:21:01.912
-[Brad] Hey. boo Berry?
-[Berry] Hmm?

356
00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:04.741
-[Brad] Whatcha doing?
-[Berry] Starting a fire.

357
00:21:04.785 --> 00:21:08.441
-[Brad] Are ya?
-[Berry] Well. it's gonna start.

358
00:21:08.484 --> 00:21:11.270
[Hanna] Berry. I'm pretty sure
you need some kindling
or something.

359
00:21:11.313 --> 00:21:14.490
Uh. I know how to start
a fire. Hanna. thank you though!

360
00:21:14.534 --> 00:21:15.926
[Mia] Apparently not.

361
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.320
[Hanna] Okay.
Well. I'm just saying.

362
00:21:18.364 --> 00:21:20.714
You can't just put a lighter
straight to wood
because it's not gonna catch.

363
00:21:20.757 --> 00:21:22.542
This is how the
cavemen did it. okay?

364
00:21:22.585 --> 00:21:25.327
You know what. Hanna. why
don't you start the fire then?

365
00:21:25.371 --> 00:21:28.330
[Hanna] Okay. sure.
Just hold my phone for me.

366
00:21:31.638 --> 00:21:33.640
Could I get the lighter?

367
00:21:33.683 --> 00:21:37.034
Thanks. and does anybody have
any kindling?

368
00:21:37.078 --> 00:21:39.994
-I have some newspaper
in my backpack we can use.
-Perfect.

369
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.389
[Berry] So why do you
have newspaper?

370
00:21:44.868 --> 00:21:46.392
To start fires.

371
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.830
[Berry] Oh. cool!

372
00:21:49.873 --> 00:21:52.311
Thanks for letting me know that
ten minutes ago
when I tried to start the fire!

373
00:21:54.008 --> 00:21:56.532
You said you knew
what you were doing...

374
00:21:58.621 --> 00:22:00.754
Plus. it was fun
watching you struggle.

375
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.846
-[Berry] God. I hate you.
-[Hanna] No you don't.

376
00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:08.718
-Thank you.
-Get it done!

377
00:22:08.762 --> 00:22:11.417
Could you. uh.
pass me the funnies?

378
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.984
Ha. ha. ha. You're so funny.

379
00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:16.117
I know. that's where
I get all my material.

380
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.082
[Berry] Burning coupons?
Come on now.

381
00:22:25.126 --> 00:22:26.214
[Hanna] Yeah.

382
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.740
[Berry] [laughs]
Yeah. you showed me!

383
00:22:30.784 --> 00:22:33.569
-It'll light!
-[Brad] It'll get there!

384
00:22:34.962 --> 00:22:36.703
[Mia] There we go!

385
00:22:36.746 --> 00:22:38.531
One giant leap for feminism.

386
00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.664
Thanks. Brad.

387
00:22:44.058 --> 00:22:45.929
That's pretty embarrassing.
Berry.

388
00:22:45.973 --> 00:22:47.627
-[Hanna] So that's how
it's done.
-[Berry] Yeah. okay.

389
00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.106
Now you know!

390
00:22:51.935 --> 00:22:57.419
So did you guys know
that hot dogs can legally be
30% hair?

391
00:22:57.463 --> 00:22:59.639
-[Brad] Wow!
-[Hanna] Yeah.

392
00:22:59.682 --> 00:23:03.382
[Brad] Did you know that
47% of statistics are made up
on the spot?

393
00:23:03.425 --> 00:23:06.385
Wait. is that true?

394
00:23:07.908 --> 00:23:10.432
-[Berry] Oh. my God!
-[Hanna] Mia! Seriously?

395
00:23:10.476 --> 00:23:12.260
It's very. very true.

396
00:23:12.303 --> 00:23:14.741
Do you believe anything
that Brad says? Like ever?

397
00:23:14.784 --> 00:23:16.917
-[Jay] No.
-Whoa. Whoa!

398
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.875
Someday I'm going to say
something really important

399
00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:20.703
and you're all gonna regret
not listening to me.

400
00:23:20.747 --> 00:23:24.838
-Uh. huh. sure.
Sure. someday. someday.
-[Brad] Someday!

401
00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:27.580
-[Hanna] I'll wait for that day
to come.
-Oh! Whatcha got there. Berry?

402
00:23:27.623 --> 00:23:30.931
A little... a little less
drinky. drink than before...

403
00:23:32.498 --> 00:23:33.716
-You guys want some?
-Yeah!

404
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.283
Yes. yes. yes

405
00:23:36.197 --> 00:23:38.155
I'm tired of sharing my weed
with you fools.

406
00:23:38.199 --> 00:23:39.983
-Oh. that's still going
to happen.
-[Jay] Right!

407
00:23:43.291 --> 00:23:44.335
[Hanna] Jay.

408
00:23:47.295 --> 00:23:48.557
[spits]

409
00:23:48.601 --> 00:23:50.429
-[Mia] Whoa!
-[Berry] Gosh!

410
00:23:50.472 --> 00:23:54.171
[Jay] What the hell is this?
Gasoline?

411
00:23:54.215 --> 00:23:56.347
Damn. rocket fuel?

412
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:58.219
[Berry] It's moonshine!

413
00:23:58.262 --> 00:24:00.395
[Mia] Aren't you in college?

414
00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:04.138
[Jay] Yeah but I only drink
the good stuff.
not this jailhouse shit!

415
00:24:05.835 --> 00:24:08.055
-[Berry] Jay. that is
the good stuff. man.
-[Mia] Seriously!

416
00:24:08.098 --> 00:24:09.796
-[Berry] It burns in a good way!
-[Hanna] The best stuff.

417
00:24:09.839 --> 00:24:11.580
[Mia] Burns so good.

418
00:24:11.624 --> 00:24:15.541
[Hanna] You want to get drunk.
that's the stuff that you need.

419
00:24:15.584 --> 00:24:16.846
Oh. gosh.

420
00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:21.024
[Mia] Oh. my God!

421
00:24:21.068 --> 00:24:23.766
[Jay] The map! Shit!

422
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.072
Shit!

423
00:24:28.205 --> 00:24:31.557
What the hell. Brad.
That was really stupid!

424
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.472
[Brad] Sorry. guys. Just a goof.

425
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:40.479
I don't know why the map
was on the ground anyway...

426
00:24:40.522 --> 00:24:41.958
[Jay] Damn!

427
00:24:42.002 --> 00:24:45.745
[Hanna] Jay. it's fine.
Everything's fine.

428
00:24:45.788 --> 00:24:47.486
[Berry] Relax. man.
Any of us could have done that.

429
00:24:47.529 --> 00:24:50.184
[Mia] Yeah. you almost did
when you coughed it up!

430
00:24:50.227 --> 00:24:52.926
[Jay] But I didn't do it
on purpose like a little moron!

431
00:24:54.362 --> 00:24:56.625
[Brad] I said I was sorry.
what do you want from me?

432
00:24:56.669 --> 00:25:00.411
[Jay] I want you to think before
you do stupid shit
like spit fire at people!

433
00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:02.501
You're not a damn
fire breather. Brad!

434
00:25:03.589 --> 00:25:05.416
[Brad] Okay.
I didn't spit it at people.

435
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.463
[Hanna] Guys. can we just
calm down. okay. just stop it.

436
00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:12.989
Everything is fine.
We're all okay. Chill.

437
00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:23.522
[Jay] I guess
it could have been worse.

438
00:25:24.827 --> 00:25:26.002
[Mia] Here.

439
00:25:26.046 --> 00:25:27.438
[Jay sighs]

440
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.356
[Jay] Sorry. Brad.
I just freaked out a little.

441
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.575
It's cool.

442
00:25:36.099 --> 00:25:37.448
[spits]

443
00:25:38.754 --> 00:25:40.147
Back at ya!

444
00:25:41.322 --> 00:25:44.368
-Son of a bitch.
-Karmas a bitch!

445
00:25:44.412 --> 00:25:46.153
You guys all suck!

446
00:25:47.415 --> 00:25:48.764
No more fire breathing!

447
00:25:49.722 --> 00:25:51.680
[Mia] [gasps] Hi. little guy!

448
00:25:51.724 --> 00:25:53.726
-[Hanna] Oh. my God.
oh. my God. oh. my God.
-[Mia] So fuzzy!

449
00:25:53.769 --> 00:25:56.772
[Hanna] Holy shit!
Look at those eyes!

450
00:25:56.816 --> 00:25:59.645
Oh. my God.
It's so creepy!

451
00:25:59.688 --> 00:26:01.777
[Mia] It's fine though.
[screams]

452
00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:04.214
-[Mia] Where'd it go?
Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
-[Jay] Oh. no!

453
00:26:05.912 --> 00:26:07.827
-[Brad] Alright. say it. Jay.
-Chubby bunny!

454
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:19.273
-You are drunker than a skunk!
-Jay. you are a hoot. man!

455
00:26:19.316 --> 00:26:21.797
Pass that shit. Boo!

456
00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:24.452
[laughing]

457
00:26:25.888 --> 00:26:30.110
-[Brad] That man cannot hold
his liquor.
-[Mia] I'm burning wieners!

458
00:26:30.153 --> 00:26:32.286
You're good at that. aren't you?

459
00:26:32.329 --> 00:26:34.549
Yes. I'm very good at that.

460
00:26:36.856 --> 00:26:40.555
This is fun but. we shoulda...

461
00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:43.645
We could... we. uh. we coulda
went to bed but we...

462
00:26:43.689 --> 00:26:46.082
We should... we haven't yet?

463
00:26:46.126 --> 00:26:49.390
-[Brad] Here here!
-[Hanna] Yeah?

464
00:26:50.304 --> 00:26:51.653
I don't know what you just said?

465
00:26:51.697 --> 00:26:52.959
I don't know...

466
00:26:56.179 --> 00:26:58.268
Bed time! Bed time.

467
00:26:58.312 --> 00:27:02.272
Who do you think you are?
You're not our dad!

468
00:27:02.316 --> 00:27:05.058
We can go to bed
when we want to!

469
00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:07.930
You ain't my momma
and you ain't my daddy!

470
00:27:09.192 --> 00:27:11.804
[Brad] Oh! Grumpy Berry!

471
00:27:13.588 --> 00:27:15.285
[blows raspberry]

472
00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:17.287
R.E.S.

473
00:27:17.331 --> 00:27:21.335
Move your feet!
R.E.S.P.E.C.

474
00:27:21.378 --> 00:27:23.685
-[Jay] Find out what it
means to me!
-[Brad] The alpha. everyone.

475
00:27:23.729 --> 00:27:25.992
Give him a round of applause!

476
00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:28.211
Look what happened
to my marshmallow.

477
00:27:29.517 --> 00:27:31.345
-It went limp.
-I don't know what happened!

478
00:27:31.388 --> 00:27:33.695
[Brad] Because you don't know
how to roast marshmallows...

479
00:27:33.739 --> 00:27:37.394
Okay. Mr. Expert
marshmallow cooker...

480
00:27:37.438 --> 00:27:39.788
I... I won the
marshmallow competition of 2012!

481
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:43.879
Okay.

482
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:47.883
I think I'm going to
go to bed too.

483
00:27:47.927 --> 00:27:50.843
-Ah! Boo!
-Boo on you!

484
00:27:50.886 --> 00:27:53.933
-Here. that's for you.
-Thank you.

485
00:27:53.976 --> 00:27:56.370
-Oh! I dropped it!
-[Hanna] Loser.

486
00:27:56.413 --> 00:27:59.068
[Brad] Oh. no!
I've got plenty more.

487
00:28:01.636 --> 00:28:02.942
[Jay] Peace out!

488
00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:08.643
No. no. no Jay!
Jay. Jay. Jay. that way!

489
00:28:08.687 --> 00:28:10.514
-That way!
-Boys with the boys.

490
00:28:10.558 --> 00:28:13.648
-[Brad] I thought you had it.
my man.
-Goodnight boys!

491
00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:15.389
You coming. Brad?

492
00:28:15.432 --> 00:28:17.391
-Goodnight. Goodnight.
-[Hanna] Goodnight. Brad.

493
00:28:18.348 --> 00:28:20.002
[Brad] Whoa! Don't fall!

494
00:28:20.046 --> 00:28:21.743
You coming. Brad?

495
00:28:21.787 --> 00:28:25.181
Actually. Berry. will you
toss me my sleeping bag?

496
00:28:26.574 --> 00:28:27.706
[Berry] Yeah!

497
00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:30.056
[Brad] Get over there. you fool.

498
00:28:30.099 --> 00:28:32.362
I'm going to sleep
under the stars tonight.

499
00:28:32.406 --> 00:28:36.236
-Whoa. whoa. whoa!
-I'm never. I'm never scared!

500
00:28:37.977 --> 00:28:40.022
-Help this man to bed.
-Kobe!

501
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:42.851
Thank you. Whoa!

502
00:28:44.505 --> 00:28:46.986
This is coming with me!

503
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:49.292
I don't think you need
any more but you do you.

504
00:28:50.816 --> 00:28:53.862
[Berry] Jay. I swear to God
if you piss the bed...

505
00:28:53.906 --> 00:28:55.864
[Brad] That's why
I'm sleeping out here.

506
00:28:57.779 --> 00:29:01.827
I was asleep and I heard
some rustling in the bushes...

507
00:29:03.132 --> 00:29:05.918
I have a knife just in case.

508
00:29:10.139 --> 00:29:11.837
Oh. shit! I have a knife!

509
00:29:13.403 --> 00:29:16.406
That's not a knife.
this is a knife!

510
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.414
-Hanna. you scared
the shit out of me!
-Shhh. shh. shh.

511
00:29:28.331 --> 00:29:30.290
[Hanna] There room for one more
in there?

512
00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:33.641
I mean. super not...
but we can try.

513
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:49.265
-It's so beautiful here.
-[Brad] Totally.

514
00:29:51.398 --> 00:29:55.881
-I'm really glad you came.
-[Hanna] Me too.

515
00:30:14.421 --> 00:30:15.814
Oh.

516
00:30:20.209 --> 00:30:24.823
[kissing]

517
00:30:29.044 --> 00:30:30.916
Your face is so fuzzy.

518
00:30:44.103 --> 00:30:49.717
[Berry] Three. two. one...
Holy shit. Brad. a giant penis!

519
00:30:50.936 --> 00:30:52.807
You son of a bitch!

520
00:31:01.207 --> 00:31:02.599
[Brad] Hmm. tasty.

521
00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:10.651
[Berry] Hanna. Mia.
you girls up yet?

522
00:31:13.915 --> 00:31:16.918
-Girls?
-[Hanna] Yes!

523
00:31:16.962 --> 00:31:20.095
-[Berry] Are you up?
-[Hanna] We're up.
We'll be out in a minute. okay?

524
00:31:20.139 --> 00:31:22.054
[Berry] Mmm. okay...

525
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.187
Ah. tornado!

526
00:31:25.231 --> 00:31:26.885
-[Mia] Oh. my God!
-[Hanna] Oh. my God! Berry!

527
00:31:28.321 --> 00:31:29.452
[Berry] Okay.

528
00:31:29.496 --> 00:31:31.585
-Did I get it all?
-No.

529
00:31:32.978 --> 00:31:35.197
Hey. sorry. about the map. man.

530
00:31:35.241 --> 00:31:38.157
-You're all good. bro.
it's cool.
-Alright.

531
00:31:40.376 --> 00:31:41.464
[sighs]

532
00:31:45.642 --> 00:31:48.210
[Brad] Let's check that
urine color. ladies and gents!

533
00:31:49.472 --> 00:31:53.172
Gonna get that hangover pee
probably not gonna look great...

534
00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:58.917
[Jay] Hey. Berry. can you
help me out for a sec?

535
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.092
[Berry] What's up. dude?

536
00:32:06.315 --> 00:32:09.710
All right. so
I got this all worked out.

537
00:32:09.753 --> 00:32:16.586
If we go like two extra miles.
we can go around
the burnt portion of the map.

538
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:17.848
[zipping]

539
00:32:19.285 --> 00:32:22.853
[Brad] Wow!
What a beautiful place.

540
00:32:28.294 --> 00:32:32.646
Oh. Berry and Jay
nerding out over a map
instead of enjoying the view.

541
00:32:34.343 --> 00:32:35.562
Alright.

542
00:32:36.867 --> 00:32:38.260
[zipping]

543
00:32:40.654 --> 00:32:43.874
Oh. wait a minute... Ugh!

544
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:46.790
What is that?

545
00:32:49.097 --> 00:32:51.099
Ah. damnit! Gross!

546
00:32:53.232 --> 00:32:55.799
Why do I touch things?
Don't touch things!

547
00:32:56.887 --> 00:33:00.630
[Berry] I mean I'm cool with it
but it's not like that
section of the map

548
00:33:00.674 --> 00:33:02.632
is any more dangerous
because we burnt it.

549
00:33:02.676 --> 00:33:06.245
it's still there so just stick
to the original route. man.

550
00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:10.292
I mean. we won't know
where we are going so...

551
00:33:10.336 --> 00:33:12.686
We'll be alright. dude. it's...

552
00:33:12.729 --> 00:33:14.427
It'll be fine.
it's still the same thing.

553
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:17.386
Good morning. Vietnam!

554
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.823
-[Jay] Morning!
-[Berry] Morning. ladies!

555
00:33:19.867 --> 00:33:21.521
[Brad] Let me help you girls out
with that.

556
00:33:21.564 --> 00:33:24.263
[Hanna] Um. I think we're good
over here. Thanks. Brad.

557
00:33:24.306 --> 00:33:27.005
[Brad] Alright. fine.
interviews then...

558
00:33:29.746 --> 00:33:33.011
So... crazy night last night..
huh?

559
00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:36.492
[Mia] Oh. my gosh.
I was so drunk.

560
00:33:36.536 --> 00:33:38.755
I can't believe
I'm not hungover.

561
00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:41.932
Yeah. I know. I'm pretty sure
I blacked out for a little bit
so...

562
00:33:41.976 --> 00:33:43.934
Seriously?
You don't remember anything?

563
00:33:43.978 --> 00:33:49.723
I mean. I remember some things.
It's just a little fuzzy.

564
00:33:51.638 --> 00:33:53.292
What's on your fingers?

565
00:33:53.335 --> 00:33:55.076
[Brad] Yeah. I don't know.

566
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.557
I think it's like bird shit
or something? It's gross.

567
00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:00.386
Brad. why the hell do you have
bird shit on your fingers?

568
00:34:00.429 --> 00:34:03.345
That is an incredibly
personal question. Hanna!

569
00:34:04.738 --> 00:34:06.653
Stop it!

570
00:34:12.137 --> 00:34:14.400
You enjoying the view
back there?

571
00:34:14.443 --> 00:34:16.619
[Hanna] Shut up. [laughs]

572
00:34:16.663 --> 00:34:21.537
All right. guys. We are now
entering the burnt portion
of the map.

573
00:34:21.581 --> 00:34:24.758
Just watch where you're going.
If we get lost.
we'll have to double back.

574
00:34:24.801 --> 00:34:27.021
[Hanna] Are you actually
worried we're gonna get lost?

575
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.892
[singsongy] The horror!

576
00:34:30.242 --> 00:34:32.418
Jay. relax dude.
we're not gonna get lost.

577
00:34:32.461 --> 00:34:36.465
Alright. guys. look we are here
and we're going there.

578
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.121
[Mia] Oh. that's like
perfectly straight!

579
00:34:40.165 --> 00:34:41.862
We still need to pay attention.

580
00:34:44.473 --> 00:34:46.475
[Hanna] Dude. chill.
It's gonna be fine.

581
00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:49.783
I'm... I'm chill but I want
to be prepared
in case we do get lost.

582
00:34:50.784 --> 00:34:52.090
Okay. crazy man.

583
00:34:52.133 --> 00:34:55.702
Scanning... Scanning...
Scanning...

584
00:34:55.745 --> 00:34:58.357
Rock. Stick. Bush.

585
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.753
This spot is now memorized.
forever burned into the crystal
palace of my mind.

586
00:35:04.798 --> 00:35:06.974
Come on. Robot Brad says
it's cool.

587
00:35:07.017 --> 00:35:09.455
If Robot Brad says it's cool.
it must be cool.

588
00:35:09.498 --> 00:35:13.589
[Hanna] So cool. Loser.

589
00:35:13.633 --> 00:35:18.899
[Brad] Rock. Cactus.
Oh! Orange flower!
I will never forget this spot.

590
00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:27.821
[Hanna] ...I just don't like it
very much.

591
00:35:27.864 --> 00:35:29.605
[Berry] Jay. what's up. man?

592
00:35:30.563 --> 00:35:33.740
What does it look like?
A damn fork!

593
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:39.615
I have no memory of this place.

594
00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:42.314
What?
We ain't never been here before!

595
00:35:42.357 --> 00:35:46.405
Jay. it's from...
never mind. dude. Sorry.

596
00:35:46.448 --> 00:35:48.276
I thought you said
it was just a straight shot.

597
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.191
Neither of these go straight.

598
00:35:50.235 --> 00:35:53.412
Yeah. and one of them
got to bend back up so.

599
00:35:53.455 --> 00:35:55.196
So let's just pick a direction.

600
00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.980
-If it's wrong.
we'll just turn around.
-Yeah.

601
00:35:57.024 --> 00:35:58.721
-Cool.
-No. No. no. no.

602
00:35:58.765 --> 00:36:00.027
We camp here.

603
00:36:01.811 --> 00:36:04.205
-The sun's almost going down...
-[Hanna] What?

604
00:36:04.249 --> 00:36:06.729
Dude. the Sun isn't going down
for another couple hours. okay?

605
00:36:06.773 --> 00:36:09.558
And we're supposed to camp
at the ruins. so...

606
00:36:09.602 --> 00:36:11.778
We're so close. we might as well
just keep going!

607
00:36:11.821 --> 00:36:13.301
And what if we go the wrong way?

608
00:36:14.824 --> 00:36:17.087
We should camp before the fork.

609
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:20.613
I just... I just thought
you might feel safer that way.

610
00:36:21.527 --> 00:36:23.746
Dude. you sound
like a crazy person.

611
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.618
Let's just pick a direction.

612
00:36:25.661 --> 00:36:27.620
If it's wrong.
we'll just turn around.
What's the big deal?

613
00:36:27.663 --> 00:36:30.057
[sighs] Fine!

614
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.626
I don't know why it's crazy
to want to know where
you're going but whatever!

615
00:36:33.669 --> 00:36:36.977
[Berry] Jay. relax dude.
alright. just... which way?

616
00:36:37.891 --> 00:36:40.676
I don't know.
That's why I had a damn map!

617
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.462
Shit! Okay. Berry. you pick.

618
00:36:43.505 --> 00:36:45.464
Me? Hell no!

619
00:36:45.507 --> 00:36:47.901
Brads' the one who
burned the map...
he should have to pick!

620
00:36:47.944 --> 00:36:50.469
Oh. so then I get blamed for
burning the map and picking
the wrong direction?

621
00:36:50.512 --> 00:36:52.210
-Yes.
-No thanks.

622
00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:55.343
Okay. guys. calm down.
Everybody get into a circle.

623
00:37:02.176 --> 00:37:04.004
-Nice spin!
-[Brad] Oh. shit!

624
00:37:04.047 --> 00:37:06.180
You guys have to kiss!

625
00:37:06.224 --> 00:37:07.877
Alright. if you insist.

626
00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:10.489
Okay. Mia. you get to choose.
Which way are we going?

627
00:37:10.532 --> 00:37:14.319
Alright. screw it.
Let's just go left!

628
00:37:14.362 --> 00:37:18.192
-Left it is.
-After you.

629
00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:29.116
[birds chirping]

630
00:37:31.727 --> 00:37:34.208
Hey. guys. so this is day two.

631
00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:37.037
Sorry this isn't live but
there's like no service up here.

632
00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.387
so I'll have to post this all
after I get back

633
00:37:39.431 --> 00:37:43.304
but I guess if you're watching.
this means that I'm home.
so cray!

634
00:37:43.348 --> 00:37:45.001
Hi. future Mia!

635
00:37:45.045 --> 00:37:47.743
So this is like the only time
I've been in back.

636
00:37:47.787 --> 00:37:51.747
These guys are great
but they are nowhere near
as experienced as I am

637
00:37:51.791 --> 00:37:55.055
in the matters
of the great outdoors. Guys?

638
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:08.895
[birds chirping]

639
00:38:14.335 --> 00:38:17.251
[Mia] This isn't funny! Guys?

640
00:38:24.824 --> 00:38:26.304
Guys. stop it!

641
00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.613
[screaming]

642
00:38:31.657 --> 00:38:34.224
Oh. my God! Oh. my God!

643
00:38:34.268 --> 00:38:36.531
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
They made me do it.

644
00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:42.232
[Jay] How do you do that again?

645
00:38:42.276 --> 00:38:44.365
-You just like. flick it
or something?
-Wait. where is one?

646
00:38:44.409 --> 00:38:46.367
-I want to get one on camera.
-So you put your finger
like this....

647
00:38:46.411 --> 00:38:48.543
-Are you ready?
-[Berry] Get it!

648
00:38:48.587 --> 00:38:50.763
-[Brad] You go like that.
-Jeez.

649
00:38:50.806 --> 00:38:52.068
-[Mia] Oh! You got two!
-[Berry] You gotta flick it.

650
00:38:52.112 --> 00:38:54.462
-Wait. I got two?
-[Mia] Yeah.

651
00:39:00.425 --> 00:39:01.817
[Brad] I'm struggling.

652
00:39:01.861 --> 00:39:03.384
[Hanna] Struggle bus over here?

653
00:39:03.428 --> 00:39:04.994

Yeah. sorry guys.
I think I picked the wrong way.

hike around the burnt portion
of the map.

Okay. well. that's really
helpful. Thanks. Jay!

make camp here?

Just in case. you know?

860
00:59:14.638 --> 00:59:16.291

I just... I just ran...
I just ran for my life right now
and I don't...

874

I don't think he followed me
but how could he.

875
01:00:34.543 --> 01:00:38.896
Did he kill Brad too?
I don't know. I just don't know!

876
01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.076
I think I'm...
I think I'm in some cave.

877
01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:47.382

895
01:03:14.181 --> 01:03:17.532
-Berry... Berry's the one
that killed Jay.
-What?

896
01:03:17.576 --> 01:03:21.232
-No. he didn't. no!
-Yes! Yes. Mia.
I watched it happen. okay?

897
01:03:21.275 --> 01:03:26.454
I watched Berry stab Jay through
the chest with this damn spear.
okay?

898
01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.242
[screams]

899
01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.070
What the hell is happening.
Hanna?

900
01:03:33.113 --> 01:03:36.377
I don't know. Mia. I don't know.
I don't know!

901
01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:39.598
-Are you sure it was Berry?
-Yes! I even got a video of it
on my phone!

902
01:03:39.641 --> 01:03:42.383
-Okay. where is your phone?
-I... I don't know!

903
01:03:42.427 --> 01:03:44.690
I dropped it when
I was attacked. I don't know!

904
01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:46.518
Are you positive it wasn't Berry
who attacked you too?

905
01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:50.739
Yes. I am 100% sure. Mia.
yes Berry killed Jay.

906
01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:54.874
but the person that attacked me
was covered head to toe
in black paint. okay?

907
01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:57.746
Okay. okay.
Where did he attack you?

908
01:03:57.790 --> 01:04:01.576
In a cave. I don't know.
I just ran. That doesn't matter!

909
01:04:04.884 --> 01:04:06.886
-[Mia] Well. we need to
head back to camp.
-What?

910
01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:09.584
No. no. no. We need to get back
to the car. Mia!

915
01:04:24.512 --> 01:04:25.774
[Hanna] I don't see him.

916
01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:34.087
Shit. if he left with the map.
we're gonna be screwed out here!

917
01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:37.569
[Mia] We should look around
for it just in case.

918
01:04:43.618 --> 01:04:47.318
-Let's move!
-[Hanna] Okay.

919

Let's get the hell out of here!

922
01:05:29.534 --> 01:05:31.318
Okay. I'm going to say goodbye
to Brad.

923
01:05:31.362 --> 01:05:34.365
We can't come back here
and I'm never going to
see him again.

924
01:05:36.062 --> 01:05:38.804
-We have to go!
-Just give me a minute. okay?

925
01:05:42.329 --> 01:05:44.462
-No. No. no. no. no.
-What?

926
01:05:44.505 --> 01:05:45.942
I'm gonna kill him!

927
01:05:45.985 --> 01:05:47.247
-[Berry] I buried both of them.
-[Mia screams]

928
01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:48.945
Don't take a step closer!

929
01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:56.735
I didn't kill Jay. okay?
It wasn't me!

930
01:05:56.778 --> 01:05:59.999
I watched it happen!

931
01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:02.436
[Berry] I can't explain
what happened. okay.

932
01:06:04.177 --> 01:06:07.528
I had no control of my body.
I don't know what happened!
You gotta believe me!

933
01:06:07.572 --> 01:06:09.182
That's a bunch of bullshit.
Berry!

934
01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:11.619
Mia. please! Just listen to me!

935
01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:16.755
[gloomy music playing]

936

937
01:06:23.283 --> 01:06:24.763
[Hanna] Mia!

938
01:06:27.113 --> 01:06:28.723
What the hell is happening?

939
01:06:29.724 --> 01:06:32.075
Mia. don't move!

940
01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:35.992
[coughing. choking]

941
01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.221
Stay low! Mia. stay low!

942
01:06:49.527 --> 01:06:52.095
[panting]

943
01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:03.106
[Berry] Come over here. Zip it!

944
01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:07.458
So we just got attacked
by our own shadows.

945
01:07:09.373 --> 01:07:10.722
What the hell!

946
01:07:12.332 --> 01:07:15.031
I got stabbed in the arm by that
damn spear and Hanna was...

947
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:19.078
Well. Hanna's shadow was
trying to kill Mia.

948
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:24.953
I know all this sounds nuts
but it's... it's all true.

949
01:07:26.912 --> 01:07:28.218
This is insane!

950
01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:36.139
The way I look at it.
we can just hike at night.

951
01:07:36.182 --> 01:07:37.879
there's no shadows at night...
we'll hike then

952
01:07:37.923 --> 01:07:40.186
-and stay in the tent
during the day.
-What?

953
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:42.449
But... but what about
the shadow man?

954
01:07:42.493 --> 01:07:43.972
[Berry] The what. no...

955
01:07:44.016 --> 01:07:46.149
That's what I'm saying.
no. no. sun. no shadows!

956
01:07:46.192 --> 01:07:51.023
No! No. There's a shadow man.
a physical shadow man.

957
01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:54.461
He's painted all black
and he attacked Hanna and tied
her to that totem pole thing!

958
01:07:54.505 --> 01:07:56.768
What the hell guys?

959
01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:58.813
Why didn't you tell me
about this earlier?

960
01:07:58.857 --> 01:08:01.642
We haven't exactly had time
for conversation right now.
Berry!

961
01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:06.256
Are you sure it's just one guy?

962
01:08:06.299 --> 01:08:08.432
I mean. I don't... I don't know.
I think so...

963
01:08:08.475 --> 01:08:11.870
but he knocked me out
for all know there could just be
a bunch of them.

964
01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:13.045
I don't know.

965
01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:14.525
Guys. we can't stay here.

966
01:08:14.568 --> 01:08:17.789
No shit. Berry!
We need to find a plan to...

967
01:08:17.832 --> 01:08:19.182
if he comes back.

968
01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:21.140
You mean when he comes back!

969
01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:23.011
Why are you so sure
he'll come back?

970
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.799
I don't know why. I think
he like worships the shadows
or something...

971
01:08:27.842 --> 01:08:31.542
Why else would he be painted
all black and tie me
to a totem pole?

972
01:08:33.065 --> 01:08:34.849
He was sacrificing me.

-No. no. no. no! Shit. guys.

-Yeah!

978
01:09:19.329 --> 01:09:21.548
No. he's gone. we won!

979
01:09:21.592 --> 01:09:23.681
