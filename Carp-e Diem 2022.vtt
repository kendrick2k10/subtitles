3
00:00:22.864 --> 00:00:24.554
- Roger. please!

4
00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:29.169
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:39.278
- Do you know
what I value the most?

6
00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:42.908
Trust.

7
00:00:46.385 --> 00:00:50.584
Without trust.
you have nothing.

8
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.826
You're like a helpless
little fish.

9
00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:56.762
swimming in a pond of sharks.

10
00:00:56.898 --> 00:00:58.462
No one to get your back.

11
00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.434
No one to protect you.

12
00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:10.243
When I heard it was you.
I said. "No way."

13
00:01:11.207 --> 00:01:13.372
Not Blake.

14
00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:15.116
He would never do that.

15
00:01:22.287 --> 00:01:24.191
He's like a brother to me.

16
00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:29.196
And a brother would never
break my trust like that.

17
00:01:31.363 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

18
00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.994
Where did
you take my Tasha?

19
00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:41.571
It's okay.

20
00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:44.777
Nothing has been done
that can't be fixed.

21
00:01:44.913 --> 00:01:47.373
We just need trust.

22
00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.150
Wouldn't you agree?

23
00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:55.621
I know you
drove her somewhere.

24
00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:56.887
Where?

25
00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:00.522
I took her to Ogden.

26
00:02:00.657 --> 00:02:02.025
dropped her off at
the bus station.

27
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:04.094
That's all. I swear.

28
00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.793
Where was she headed?

29
00:02:08.738 --> 00:02:10.864
L.A. I think.

30
00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:13.834
You're doing good.

31
00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:20.379
Is it true?
Is she pregnant with my child?

32
00:02:23.014 --> 00:02:24.913
Is it?!

33
00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.477
Yes.

34
00:02:39.168 --> 00:02:40.495
How are you
going to find her?

35
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.159
L.A. is
a really big place.

36
00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:44.535
I'm going to find her
and bring her back.

37
00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.336
Please. I'll do anything.
I swear.

38
00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:54.241
Shh.

39
00:02:54.376 --> 00:02:56.280
It's okay.

40
00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:59.176
Let's pray together.
brother.

41
00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:06.151
Dear Lord. I thank you
for the power of forgiveness.

42
00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:11.025
and I choose to forgive
everyone who has hurt me.

43
00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:15.928
Help me set my enemies free
and release them on to you.

44
00:03:16.064 --> 00:03:19.438
Help me bless those
who have hurt me.

45
00:03:19.573 --> 00:03:24.277
help me walk in righteousness.
peace. and joy.

46
00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:28.315
I choose to be kind
and compassionate.

47
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.418
forgiving all others
just as you forgave me.

48
00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:42.186
In Jesus' name. Amen!

49
00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.904
I know. little one.

50
00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:59.010
One day. we'll have a house
just like that.

51
00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.845
Oh. God! Holy shit!

52
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.882
You good?

53
00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:10.390
Yeah. I wouldn't go in there
for a little while.

54
00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:14.258
Thanks for the warning.

55
00:04:14.394 --> 00:04:16.387
You know.
I was thinking.

56
00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:20.132
maybe we could head north
for the rest of the summer.

57
00:04:20.268 --> 00:04:22.869
You know.
it'll be cooler.

58
00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:24.771
What do you think?

59
00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:26.872
It's fine.

60
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:28.267
What's that?

61
00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:30.271
A house.

62
00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:32.646
Looks nice.

63
00:04:32.781 --> 00:04:35.210
Yeah.

64
00:04:35.346 --> 00:04:36.539
What's wrong?

65
00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:37.843
Nothing.

66
00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.753
I can tell
something's wrong.

67
00:04:39.888 --> 00:04:41.355
What is it?

68
00:04:43.392 --> 00:04:45.015
It's just that the baby
is almost here.

69
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.093
Yeah. I know.

70
00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.653
Then what
are we gonna do?

71
00:04:48.788 --> 00:04:50.430
What do you mean?

72
00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:52.756
Vern.
we can't keep doing this.

73
00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:54.564
Going from city to city.

74
00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.394
We have to settle down.
get ready.

75
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.737
We will.

76
00:04:57.872 --> 00:04:59.569
When?

77
00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:01.903
She kicked!
Did you feel that?

78
00:05:02.038 --> 00:05:04.406
Yes. of course. silly.
Oh. that's our girl.

79
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:06.245
Um. it could be a boy.

80
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.641
No. It's a girl.
I can tell.

81
00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:11.213
She kicks like her mom.

82
00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.649
She's strong.

83
00:05:13.785 --> 00:05:16.790
Don't worry.
We'll figure it out.

84
00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:18.789
I promise.

85
00:05:18.925 --> 00:05:21.623
I know I'm not the dad.
but I'm not gonna let anything

86
00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:25.690
happen to you
or the baby.

87
00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:27.734
You trust me. right?

88
00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.235
Yeah.

89
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.003
Doesn't sound
very convincing.

90
00:05:32.138 --> 00:05:33.566
I trust you.

91
00:05:33.702 --> 00:05:35.436
I love you. sugar plum.

92
00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:37.207
I love you. too. pookie.

93
00:05:49.023 --> 00:05:50.588
False alarm.

94
00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:53.155
I think it's time
we get out of here.

95
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.251
Yeah.

96
00:05:55.387 --> 00:05:57.795
You should eat first.
You hungry?

97
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.429
Have you been around me lately?
I am always hungry.

98
00:06:00.564 --> 00:06:02.132
Yeah. bacon and eggs?

99
00:06:02.268 --> 00:06:03.298
With pancakes?

100
00:06:03.434 --> 00:06:05.296
Yeah. why not?

101
00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:13.610
Hey. thanks for the house.

102
00:06:13.746 --> 00:06:17.077
And sorry for blowing up
your bathroom.

103
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.495
Hey!

104
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.964
Hey. watch the paint!

105
00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:41.002
Motherfucker.

106
00:06:41.137 --> 00:06:43.603
Fucking punkass bitches!
Don't worry. Bessie.

107
00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:45.039
It'll be all right.

108
00:06:45.174 --> 00:06:46.470
I'm gonna take you
to the car wash later.

109
00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:48.575
I'm gonna wax you up
and gonna make you shine.

110
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.977
just good as new.

111
00:06:50.113 --> 00:06:53.113
Just no respect.
you motherfucking bitches.

112
00:06:54.848 --> 00:06:56.413
They all work.

113
00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:08.764
I can give you 8.

114
00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:12.003
8?
It's worth at least 2 grand.

115
00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:15.975
Maybe somewhere else.
Here. it's worth 8.

116
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.339
1.250.

117
00:07:19.475 --> 00:07:20.647
8.

118
00:07:20.782 --> 00:07:22.747
Oh. come on. You can at least
give me a grand.

119
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.520
8.

120
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:32.316
Fine.
Fine. I'll take the cash.

121
00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.690
Gonna have to notify
the sheriff first.

122
00:07:33.825 --> 00:07:36.530
Wait. why?
They're not stolen.

123
00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:42.067
Still got to
notify the sheriff.

124
00:07:45.772 --> 00:07:48.872
My name's Natasha.
What's yours?

125
00:07:52.508 --> 00:07:54.876
Rich.

126
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:57.140
Look. Rich.
I really wish that

127
00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:58.275
I had the time
to stick around

128
00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:01.986
and wait for all that.
but I don't.

129
00:08:02.122 --> 00:08:06.993
Um. the truth is that. uh.
there might be something wrong

130
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:08.728
with my baby.

131
00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.862
The doctors say I need
an ultrasound. but. you know.

132
00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:15.459
I don't have insurance.
and I'm just really scared.

133
00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:20.398
Thank you.

134
00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.310
Um...

135
00:08:24.446 --> 00:08:25.873
Look. I really
need the money.

136
00:08:26.008 --> 00:08:27.581
You can
help me out. right?

137
00:08:29.883 --> 00:08:32.452
Okay. look. I really might
regret this.

138
00:08:32.588 --> 00:08:33.954
but I'll just take 5
for all of it.

139
00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:36.279
What do you say?

140
00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:38.592
Um. my loss
and your gain.

141
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.191
No.

142
00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:00.075
Come again.

143
00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:16.195
What happened?

144
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.197
He didn't buy it.

145
00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:18.463
Why?

146
00:09:18.598 --> 00:09:21.129
'Cause he's a fucking prick.

147
00:09:21.264 --> 00:09:23.261
Should I try?
Oh. yeah. that's gonna work.

148
00:09:23.397 --> 00:09:26.032
What does that mean?
Just drop it.

149
00:09:26.168 --> 00:09:27.466
Okay?
He's not gonna buy it.

150
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:29.706
We're gonna have better luck
selling it online.

151
00:09:29.841 --> 00:09:31.110
Well. what are
we gonna do now?

152
00:09:31.246 --> 00:09:33.713
I don't know.

153
00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:36.078
I don't know.

154
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.615
It's gonna be fine.

155
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.480
How can you say that?

156
00:09:41.616 --> 00:09:45.116
Okay. we don't have any money.
no food. no place to go.

157
00:09:45.251 --> 00:09:46.988
It's hot as hell out there.

158
00:09:47.124 --> 00:09:50.023
And I look
like a fucking hippo.

159
00:09:50.158 --> 00:09:52.922
You do not.
You look nice.

160
00:09:53.558 --> 00:09:55.762
Really. Vern? Nice?

161
00:09:55.898 --> 00:09:57.099
What's wrong with nice?

162
00:09:57.234 --> 00:09:59.039
Oh. I don't know.
what is wrong with it?

163
00:09:59.174 --> 00:10:00.941
You look...

164
00:10:01.076 --> 00:10:02.639
nice.

165
00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:04.945
Jesus.
I said you looked nice.

166
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.937
What?

167
00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:08.946
Nothing.
Nothing.

168
00:10:17.924 --> 00:10:20.188
I thought you said
you were quitting.

169
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:29.331
Why don't we just get a hotel
for the night?

170
00:10:29.466 --> 00:10:31.164
We're not wasting the only
money we have on a hotel.

171
00:10:31.299 --> 00:10:33.201
All right.
any other options then?

172
00:10:41.383 --> 00:10:42.513
What about your family?

173
00:10:42.648 --> 00:10:43.649
Excuse me?

174
00:10:43.784 --> 00:10:44.848
You said you grew up
on a farm.

175
00:10:44.984 --> 00:10:45.911
Why don't we just stay
with them?

176
00:10:46.047 --> 00:10:47.378
We are not going there.

177
00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:48.653
But I thought you
said that...

178
00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:51.688
No! I am never
going back there.

179
00:10:51.823 --> 00:10:54.090
All right.
All right.

180
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.764
So. what are
we doing then?

181
00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.561
Let's just find a place
for the night.

182
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.636
Whatever you say.

183
00:11:11.979 --> 00:11:14.739
I think that's an apple tree
by the fence.

184
00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:17.507
Mm-hmm.

185
00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:19.715
We should probably plant
a few more.

186
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:21.318
You know. to get privacy.

187
00:11:21.453 --> 00:11:22.918
Sure.

188
00:11:23.054 --> 00:11:24.817
Or pears.
I like pears. too.

189
00:11:24.952 --> 00:11:26.821
Pears are nice.

190
00:11:26.956 --> 00:11:29.089
It'd make a tasty jam.

191
00:11:29.225 --> 00:11:30.689
It'll go good
with pancakes.

192
00:11:30.825 --> 00:11:33.030
Mm-hmm.

193
00:11:38.135 --> 00:11:40.438
I think I'll swing
by the club.

194
00:11:40.573 --> 00:11:42.938
Whatever you want.

195
00:11:43.073 --> 00:11:44.804
You'll handle
things here?

196
00:11:44.939 --> 00:11:46.936
Don't I always?

197
00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:48.573
Yes.

198
00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:52.978
I'd better change.

199
00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:55.085
It's an easy gig.

200
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.426
Just go in.
double tap to the forehead.

201
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:01.492
What do you mean it's not right?

202
00:12:01.627 --> 00:12:03.621
She's the killer.

203
00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:07.163
Oh. so that's how it's gonna go.

204
00:12:10.934 --> 00:12:12.634
Well. you know what?

205
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:13.932
Go to hell!

206
00:12:15.541 --> 00:12:17.201
Nazi fucker!

207
00:12:31.019 --> 00:12:33.750
Will you get that?

208
00:12:43.997 --> 00:12:45.204
Samuel?

209
00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:46.373
Vern?

210
00:12:46.508 --> 00:12:47.868
Oh. What do you want?

211
00:12:48.004 --> 00:12:48.869
Are your kids home?

212
00:12:49.004 --> 00:12:50.140
I don't have kids.

213
00:12:50.276 --> 00:12:51.871
Oh. sorry. it must've been
your husband then.

214
00:12:52.006 --> 00:12:53.778
Is he home?

215
00:12:53.913 --> 00:12:55.341
Yes.
What is this about?

216
00:12:55.477 --> 00:12:57.042
We like your house.
What is it?

217
00:12:57.178 --> 00:12:59.985
Uh. 3 bedrooms. 2 bath?

218
00:13:00.121 --> 00:13:01.720
You're at the wrong house.
We're not selling.

219
00:13:01.856 --> 00:13:04.382
Oh. it's okay.
We're not buying.

220
00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:06.219
I think
you'd better leave.

221
00:13:06.354 --> 00:13:09.828
Don't move!
Just keep quiet.

222
00:13:09.964 --> 00:13:11.287
You have no idea
what you've just done.

223
00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:13.132
I have some idea.

224
00:13:13.268 --> 00:13:14.868
Get in.

225
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:25.703
You okay?

226
00:13:26.809 --> 00:13:29.644
Yeah.

227
00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:31.379
Shit!

228
00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:39.717
Sorry.

229
00:13:42.628 --> 00:13:44.055
- Who was it?

230
00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:52.865
I'll check the house.

231
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.567
Okay.

232
00:14:10.491 --> 00:14:12.090
Carp-e...

233
00:14:16.895 --> 00:14:19.564
We have double sinks!

234
00:14:19.699 --> 00:14:21.165
What do you think?

235
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.228
This should do for a couple
of days. right?

236
00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.404
Yeah. it's nice I guess.

237
00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:28.005
Nice?

238
00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:31.004
Yeah. You got
a problem with nice?

239
00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:33.446
Nope. not a thing.

240
00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.509
I'll get the bags.

241
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.495
Ma and Pa are
in the last bedroom.

242
00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.394
Okay.

243
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.934
The master bedroom
is loaded with jewelry.

244
00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.133
Easily get a few grand
out of it.

245
00:14:58.268 --> 00:15:00.603
I found $500
in her purse.

246
00:15:00.738 --> 00:15:02.833
Nice.

247
00:15:07.739 --> 00:15:09.911
This place
isn't too bad.

248
00:15:10.647 --> 00:15:13.677
Except for those curtains.
What's up with those?

249
00:15:13.813 --> 00:15:16.917
No. I think
they just moved in.

250
00:15:17.052 --> 00:15:18.420
That's good.

251
00:15:18.556 --> 00:15:20.059
Neighbors probably
don't even know them yet.

252
00:15:20.194 --> 00:15:22.721
It gives us a few extra days
if we wanted.

253
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.993
Hm.

254
00:15:30.128 --> 00:15:34.473
Looks like Ma and Pa
are into sweaters or fish.

255
00:15:34.608 --> 00:15:36.174
Exciting!

256
00:15:41.209 --> 00:15:42.348
That's weird.

257
00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:43.581
What?

258
00:15:43.716 --> 00:15:45.441
It's locked.

259
00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:09.498
Holy shit!
What is it?

260
00:16:09.634 --> 00:16:12.078
Holy shit!

261
00:16:13.713 --> 00:16:16.381
Holy shit!

262
00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:18.814
Well you just Hail Mary'd
the shit out of it three times

263
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:20.453
so it must be...

264
00:16:20.588 --> 00:16:23.188
Holy shit!

265
00:16:25.691 --> 00:16:27.824
I think Ma and Pa are selling
more than just sweaters.

266
00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:29.991
Yeah. no kidding.

267
00:16:41.468 --> 00:16:42.574
It's some beta boy.

268
00:16:44.042 --> 00:16:45.541
Should I shoot him?

269
00:16:45.676 --> 00:16:47.177
Yeah. Vern. like we
don't have enough

270
00:16:47.313 --> 00:16:48.647
dead bodies
in the bedroom yet.

271
00:16:48.782 --> 00:16:49.813
What should I do?

272
00:16:52.015 --> 00:16:53.581
Get rid of him.

273
00:17:01.155 --> 00:17:02.561
Yeah?

274
00:17:02.696 --> 00:17:04.057
Are you Bob?

275
00:17:04.193 --> 00:17:05.960
Who's asking?

276
00:17:06.096 --> 00:17:07.795
Lucia sent me.

277
00:17:07.931 --> 00:17:10.535
Uh-huh.

278
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.800
Well?

279
00:17:11.935 --> 00:17:13.472
Well?

280
00:17:13.607 --> 00:17:14.938
What?

281
00:17:15.073 --> 00:17:16.940
Do you have the stuff?

282
00:17:17.075 --> 00:17:19.937
I have a lot of stuff.

283
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.848
You're Samuel. right?

284
00:17:26.983 --> 00:17:29.183
Yeah.

285
00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:31.454
This is for you.
I think.

286
00:17:37.664 --> 00:17:38.925
Here.

287
00:17:39.061 --> 00:17:40.628
Thanks.

288
00:17:47.008 --> 00:17:48.101
What was that
all about?

289
00:17:48.236 --> 00:17:49.802
He's the pusher.

290
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:58.508
Holy shit!

291
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.184
My plane leaves
in two hours.

292
00:18:04.319 --> 00:18:06.016
Yes. Reno. Nevada.

293
00:18:08.257 --> 00:18:10.926
Bob Treadway.

294
00:18:11.061 --> 00:18:12.863
I'm not kidding.

295
00:18:12.998 --> 00:18:15.531
The Bob Treadway.

296
00:18:15.666 --> 00:18:18.501
And he will be working
for me this time.

297
00:18:22.608 --> 00:18:25.077
I'm here because Papa
loves me and respects me.

298
00:18:25.213 --> 00:18:27.906
That's why you're home.

299
00:18:34.787 --> 00:18:35.979
What?

300
00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:38.017
Hey. Sarge. guess
who I just found.

301
00:18:38.153 --> 00:18:39.021
Who?

302
00:18:39.157 --> 00:18:41.488
Bob and Martha Treadway.

303
00:18:41.623 --> 00:18:43.922
Wait. what the fuck?
Where?

304
00:18:44.058 --> 00:18:46.357
Looks like they're
setting up a shop in Reno.

305
00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:48.260
You sure?

306
00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:50.032
Positive.

307
00:18:50.167 --> 00:18:51.263
You want me there?

308
00:18:51.399 --> 00:18:53.167
No. no. um...

309
00:18:53.303 --> 00:18:56.041
Look. I'll do it alone.

310
00:18:56.177 --> 00:18:58.044
Okay. who else
knows about this?

311
00:18:58.179 --> 00:19:00.505
You're the first person
I called.

312
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:01.909
Should I call Andrea?

313
00:19:02.045 --> 00:19:03.544
No!

314
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.051
Just don't tell anyone
about this.

315
00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:08.753
And find me
a contact there.

316
00:19:08.888 --> 00:19:10.922
You're the boss.

317
00:19:11.058 --> 00:19:14.660
And. hey. Hudson. thanks.

318
00:19:14.795 --> 00:19:16.394
No problem.

319
00:19:23.631 --> 00:19:25.832
I got you now. motherfucker.

320
00:19:44.523 --> 00:19:46.055
It's hot as fuck out here.

321
00:19:46.191 --> 00:19:48.255
Tell me you got a lead.

322
00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:49.658
- I found her.

323
00:19:49.793 --> 00:19:53.063
She's staying with a girl
named Morgan.

324
00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:04.139
Ugh. I look like
a fucking pumpkin.

325
00:20:22.629 --> 00:20:25.894
So. uh. how long do you think
we're gonna stay here?

326
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:29.599
I don't know. As long as it
takes to move all of this.

327
00:20:29.734 --> 00:20:33.271
I counted. and we have maybe
half a mil left.

328
00:20:33.407 --> 00:20:35.275
You really think
we have half a mil here?

329
00:20:38.439 --> 00:20:40.637
Yeah. easy.

330
00:20:40.773 --> 00:20:42.039
Okay. well. careful.

331
00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:44.744
You're getting it
all over your face.

332
00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:47.247
I'm gonna lay down.

333
00:20:47.382 --> 00:20:49.789
Have a good nap.

334
00:20:49.924 --> 00:20:51.324
Oh. God. no. Vern.

335
00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:53.151
if we're gonna stay here
for another week or two.

336
00:20:53.286 --> 00:20:54.893
then we have to do something
about the stiffs.

337
00:20:55.028 --> 00:20:56.894
They fucking reek!

338
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:58.397
Yeah. sure. uh.

339
00:20:58.533 --> 00:21:01.831
we can just dump them
in the desert tonight.

340
00:21:01.967 --> 00:21:04.634
Wouldn't it make more sense to
bury them in the backyard?

341
00:21:07.175 --> 00:21:10.466
What if
the neighbors see?

342
00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.778
I guess.

343
00:21:12.913 --> 00:21:15.040
All right.

344
00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:20.151
...all connections.

345
00:21:20.286 --> 00:21:22.147
you can assemble the explosive.

346
00:21:22.282 --> 00:21:26.192
Cut the wire and connect it
to a 9-volt battery.

347
00:21:26.327 --> 00:21:29.185
Make sure the wires
are connected.

348
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:34.334
otherwise the explosive
can self-detonate.

349
00:21:36.737 --> 00:21:41.704
Connect red wire to
the circuit board. like this.

350
00:21:44.609 --> 00:21:47.611
Red wire?

351
00:21:50.016 --> 00:21:51.549
Red wire?

352
00:21:51.684 --> 00:21:53.616
After you have done
all the connections...

353
00:21:53.751 --> 00:21:56.312
Speak fucking English!

354
00:22:02.156 --> 00:22:05.756
Hey. Bob. just get
in the fucking truck!

355
00:22:11.403 --> 00:22:15.705
I fucking hate dead bodies.

356
00:22:17.371 --> 00:22:19.775
Next. you will make

357
00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:23.548
-a remote control...

358
00:22:23.684 --> 00:22:26.452
which you can use
to detonate the explosive

359
00:22:26.587 --> 00:22:28.784
-in about 200 feet away.

360
00:22:31.722 --> 00:22:33.320
You know what
we should do?

361
00:22:33.455 --> 00:22:34.989
Get a dog.

362
00:22:35.125 --> 00:22:36.658
Or maybe two dogs. you know.
to protect the house.

363
00:22:36.794 --> 00:22:38.156
There's a lot of money
back there.

364
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:40.092
Just in case.
What are you talking about?

365
00:22:40.227 --> 00:22:41.992
You know. a dog.
What are the mean ones called?

366
00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:43.994
They're. uh.
rottweilers.

367
00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:45.568
Yeah. yeah.
Rottweilers.

368
00:22:45.704 --> 00:22:48.274
Okay.
We are not getting a dog.

369
00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.774
Okay.
Okay. no dogs.

370
00:22:52.739 --> 00:22:55.207
What about a cat?

371
00:22:55.343 --> 00:22:58.515
You know. a big cat.
A fucking -- a man eating cat.

372
00:22:58.651 --> 00:23:01.118
Yeah. yeah.
A cat would be nice.

373
00:23:01.254 --> 00:23:03.282
What is wrong with you?

374
00:23:03.418 --> 00:23:04.718
Nothing.

375
00:23:04.854 --> 00:23:06.626
I'm just planning.
you know.

376
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:08.887
how to protect the house.
how to protect the money.

377
00:23:09.023 --> 00:23:11.464
how to protect
you and the baby.

378
00:23:13.926 --> 00:23:15.432
You're fucking high.

379
00:23:15.567 --> 00:23:17.470
No. I'm not.

380
00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:19.800
I haven't smoked anything
at all today.

381
00:23:19.935 --> 00:23:22.398
No. High on cocaine.
you idiot.

382
00:23:23.603 --> 00:23:25.445
Oh.

383
00:23:27.213 --> 00:23:29.482
My God.

384
00:23:46.793 --> 00:23:48.429
What the hell?

385
00:23:53.473 --> 00:23:56.337
Shit!
Vern. fucking floor it.

386
00:23:56.473 --> 00:23:57.640
That is a cop.

387
00:23:57.775 --> 00:24:00.513
Yes. it is
a fucking cop. Vern.

388
00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:02.343
What are you doing?

389
00:24:02.479 --> 00:24:04.814
Relax. relax.

390
00:24:06.115 --> 00:24:08.046
We were barely speeding.
I'll just talk to him.

391
00:24:08.182 --> 00:24:09.451
Vern. are you
fucking kidding me?

392
00:24:09.586 --> 00:24:10.814
No. you can't talk --

393
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.148
Shh. shh. shh. shh.

394
00:24:12.283 --> 00:24:14.017
Don't give me
the finger!

395
00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:16.694
Hey. it's okay.
It's okay.

396
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.659
I know how to talk to cops.
all right. babe?

397
00:24:18.795 --> 00:24:20.156
I know how
to talk to cops.

398
00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.733
It'll be fine.
It'll be fine.

399
00:24:21.868 --> 00:24:24.160
Vern. I am begging you.
You cannot bribe a fucking cop.

400
00:24:24.295 --> 00:24:25.503
Haven't you ever
seen a TV show?

401
00:24:25.638 --> 00:24:28.705
This works
all the time on TV.

402
00:24:28.841 --> 00:24:30.376
Oh. my God.
Shut up. shut up. shut up.

403
00:24:30.512 --> 00:24:32.376
Sugar plum.
don't you trust me?

404
00:24:32.511 --> 00:24:33.870
- I know how to do this.

405
00:24:34.005 --> 00:24:36.147
- Shut up!

406
00:24:36.282 --> 00:24:37.847
- He's coming.

407
00:25:01.702 --> 00:25:03.409
Hello. officer.

408
00:25:03.545 --> 00:25:05.304
Sir. do you know
how fast you were going?

409
00:25:05.439 --> 00:25:08.178
Apparently not fast enough
since you caught me.

410
00:25:08.313 --> 00:25:09.245
Am I right?

411
00:25:11.683 --> 00:25:13.712
License
and registration.

412
00:25:13.848 --> 00:25:17.546
Oh. look. Officer Dewy.

413
00:25:17.682 --> 00:25:20.252
I know I was going
a little fast back there.

414
00:25:20.387 --> 00:25:24.396
but how about
we just call it even. huh?

415
00:25:24.532 --> 00:25:26.098
Are you trying
to bribe me. sir?

416
00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:27.799
I don't know. am I?

417
00:25:27.934 --> 00:25:29.563
Do you know what the charge for
bribing an officer is?

418
00:25:29.699 --> 00:25:31.865
I don't know. do we?

419
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.205
Dewy.
Do you get it?

420
00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.076
Dewy!

421
00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:41.275
You're on something.
aren't you?

422
00:25:41.411 --> 00:25:42.612
No.

423
00:25:42.747 --> 00:25:45.714
Sir. step out
of the vehicle.

424
00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:48.214
Jesus Christ.
don't fucking...

425
00:25:53.695 --> 00:25:55.292
Sir. you don't have
to walk like that.

426
00:25:55.427 --> 00:25:57.260
Just walk normal.

427
00:25:57.395 --> 00:25:58.930
Like this?

428
00:25:59.065 --> 00:26:01.297
Sir. stop doing that.
Just walk in a straight line.

429
00:26:01.432 --> 00:26:02.764
How's this?

430
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.235
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

431
00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.913
You're not
doing it right.

432
00:26:24.049 --> 00:26:25.456
Is this good?

433
00:26:25.592 --> 00:26:27.458
Sir. stop
that right now.

434
00:26:27.594 --> 00:26:29.354
Sir. stop
that right now.

435
00:26:29.489 --> 00:26:32.126
If you do not stop.
you will be arrested.

436
00:26:36.232 --> 00:26:37.467
All right. that's it.
You asked for it.

437
00:26:37.602 --> 00:26:39.104
Hands against the car.

438
00:26:41.671 --> 00:26:44.473
Vern? Vern. Vern!

439
00:26:44.609 --> 00:26:45.670
My water just broke.

440
00:26:45.805 --> 00:26:46.673
What?

441
00:26:46.808 --> 00:26:48.070
The baby's coming.

442
00:26:48.205 --> 00:26:49.674
Are you sure? Now?

443
00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:51.110
Yeah.

444
00:26:51.245 --> 00:26:53.580
Okay. uh. everybody
stay calm.

445
00:26:53.715 --> 00:26:55.183
Don't panic.

446
00:26:55.318 --> 00:26:57.119
I've heard of this
sort of thing happening before.

447
00:26:57.254 --> 00:26:58.618
It's okay. we just got to
get to the hospital.

448
00:26:58.754 --> 00:27:00.016
We'll be fine.

449
00:27:00.152 --> 00:27:01.685
We're having a baby.

450
00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:03.957
Call your boys or call
the doctor. just do something!

451
00:27:04.092 --> 00:27:05.629
Vern. honey.
we got to go.

452
00:27:05.765 --> 00:27:07.590
We need hot towels
and water.

453
00:27:07.725 --> 00:27:10.264
And towels -- and what else
do we need?

454
00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:12.294
It's okay. they'll have it
at the hospital. baby.

455
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.667
We just got to go.
Now.

456
00:27:13.803 --> 00:27:15.206
I'm gonna be a dad.

457
00:27:15.341 --> 00:27:16.539
Congratulations.

458
00:27:16.675 --> 00:27:17.635
Will you be the godfather?

459
00:27:17.771 --> 00:27:18.876
I. uh...

460
00:27:19.011 --> 00:27:21.209
Sweetie. come on. honey.
Let's go. We got to go.

461
00:27:21.344 --> 00:27:23.649
That's a good idea.
I can give you an escort.

462
00:27:23.785 --> 00:27:26.210
Oh. no. that's okay.
We just got to go.

463
00:27:26.346 --> 00:27:28.382
I'm gonna name her
after you.

464
00:27:28.518 --> 00:27:29.855
Her?

465
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:31.390
Jesus Christ. Vern.
get in the goddamn truck!

466
00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:33.556
Sweetie.
you're all wet.

467
00:27:33.691 --> 00:27:36.018
Yeah. my water broke.

468
00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:37.394
I have towels.

469
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:38.926
No. don't open that!

470
00:27:39.061 --> 00:27:41.866
Whoa.
What is that smell?

471
00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:47.839
What?

472
00:27:52.477 --> 00:27:55.180
Holy shit!

473
00:27:55.316 --> 00:27:56.808
You shot Dewy!

474
00:27:56.943 --> 00:27:58.550
I had to.

475
00:27:58.685 --> 00:28:00.416
He was going
for his gun.

476
00:28:00.551 --> 00:28:03.322
Oh. no. oh. no.

477
00:28:03.457 --> 00:28:06.088
It's okay. It's okay.

478
00:28:06.224 --> 00:28:08.383
Come on. let's just get you
to the hospital.

479
00:28:08.519 --> 00:28:09.928
make sure
the baby's okay.

480
00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:12.190
Vern! Jesus Christ.
I'm not going into labor.

481
00:28:12.325 --> 00:28:13.526
I was
fucking faking it.

482
00:28:13.662 --> 00:28:14.527
Really?

483
00:28:14.663 --> 00:28:16.694
Yes!

484
00:28:16.829 --> 00:28:20.264
You were about to be arrested.
I had to do something.

485
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.699
I thought we were
having a baby.

486
00:28:30.849 --> 00:28:32.378
What are you doing?

487
00:28:32.513 --> 00:28:33.750
- I'm taking him back
with the others

488
00:28:33.885 --> 00:28:35.117
and burying him
in the backyard.

489
00:28:35.252 --> 00:28:36.583
like we should've done
in the first place.

490
00:28:36.718 --> 00:28:38.214
Okay.

491
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.482
Well. are you gonna help.

492
00:28:39.618 --> 00:28:41.926
or are you gonna
just stand there?

493
00:29:00.776 --> 00:29:02.412
I'm sorry. babe.

494
00:29:02.548 --> 00:29:04.309
I screwed up.

495
00:29:04.445 --> 00:29:07.378
I put you and the baby
in danger.

496
00:29:07.514 --> 00:29:10.289
It's okay.
It's fine. We're fine.

497
00:29:10.424 --> 00:29:13.253
No. no. it's not.

498
00:29:13.389 --> 00:29:15.485
We should just take
the money and go.

499
00:29:15.621 --> 00:29:17.656
Vern. we'd be stupid
to leave now.

500
00:29:17.791 --> 00:29:19.088
We're never gonna get
another opportunity like this.

501
00:29:19.223 --> 00:29:20.092
No. but what --

502
00:29:20.228 --> 00:29:21.999
Half a million dollars. Vern.

503
00:29:22.135 --> 00:29:25.965
That is enough for us
to get away for good.

504
00:29:26.101 --> 00:29:29.439
Who are you running from?

505
00:29:29.574 --> 00:29:30.642
Doesn't matter.

506
00:29:30.777 --> 00:29:33.769
Just as long
as we get away.

507
00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:38.345
All right.

508
00:29:52.489 --> 00:29:53.793
Be careful with that!

509
00:29:53.929 --> 00:29:55.490
Yes. Bethany!

510
00:29:55.626 --> 00:29:56.534
I'm sorry.
Miss Hendricks.

511
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:58.036
Are they bugging you?

512
00:29:58.171 --> 00:30:00.499
There's nothing wrong
with having a little fun.

513
00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.134
Look at what you did!

514
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.636
It wasn't me.

515
00:30:06.772 --> 00:30:10.381
You all are gonna clean
this up right now!

516
00:30:10.517 --> 00:30:12.775
Get back here!

517
00:30:17.787 --> 00:30:20.119
Are you Morgan?

518
00:30:20.255 --> 00:30:22.653
Morgan.
you have visitors.

519
00:30:30.168 --> 00:30:33.999
It's $100 an hour.
$200 if she joins.

520
00:30:34.135 --> 00:30:36.332
Anything kinky is extra.

521
00:30:36.468 --> 00:30:38.406
I'll only charge you $60.

522
00:30:38.542 --> 00:30:41.672
And you can have all the kink
you want.

523
00:30:42.981 --> 00:30:45.911
We're looking
for someone.

524
00:30:46.046 --> 00:30:46.912
Do you know her?

525
00:30:47.048 --> 00:30:48.078
Who's asking?

526
00:30:48.213 --> 00:30:49.753
Her family.

527
00:30:49.889 --> 00:30:51.247
She didn't
mention family.

528
00:30:51.383 --> 00:30:52.549
So you do know her.

529
00:30:52.685 --> 00:30:54.925
I don't know.
What's it worth to you?

530
00:30:55.061 --> 00:30:56.352
What's it worth for me
to not punch you

531
00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:57.824
in your fucking face?

532
00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.394
Easy. sister.

533
00:30:59.529 --> 00:31:02.660
Let's just pay the fine lady
for the information.

534
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.706
Yeah. I know her.

535
00:31:07.841 --> 00:31:09.105
She bunked here
for a few months

536
00:31:09.241 --> 00:31:12.337
before she bailed
without paying the rent.

537
00:31:12.473 --> 00:31:14.042
About how long ago
was that?

538
00:31:14.177 --> 00:31:15.945
I don't know.
a month ago?

539
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.107
Do you have
a phone number?

540
00:31:18.242 --> 00:31:19.677
Nope.

541
00:31:19.812 --> 00:31:23.448
It's really important
that we find her.

542
00:31:23.583 --> 00:31:24.647
I don't know
what to tell you.

543
00:31:24.783 --> 00:31:27.919
She might come back.
she might not.

544
00:31:28.054 --> 00:31:29.621
Can I?

545
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.327
Do you have a lighter?

546
00:31:35.462 --> 00:31:37.761
Does it look like
I smoke?

547
00:31:44.274 --> 00:31:46.671
If you see Natasha.
give her that.

548
00:31:48.142 --> 00:31:50.411
She owes me $500.

549
00:31:51.715 --> 00:31:53.775
Here.

550
00:31:53.911 --> 00:31:56.083
If you hear from her.
give us a call.

551
00:31:56.218 --> 00:31:58.247
and we'll pay you the rest.

552
00:32:02.595 --> 00:32:05.129
Bob? Martha?

553
00:32:05.862 --> 00:32:07.758
<i>Hola?</i>

554
00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:40.824
I'm finished.

555
00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.616
Really? You're done?

556
00:33:01.752 --> 00:33:03.286
Yep.

557
00:33:08.692 --> 00:33:13.498
I cannot wait
to take a nice warm bath.

558
00:33:13.767 --> 00:33:15.197
With a foot massage?

559
00:33:15.333 --> 00:33:19.135
Oh. now we're talking.

560
00:33:19.271 --> 00:33:21.332
Oh. do I need
to come back later?

561
00:33:21.467 --> 00:33:23.071
Who the hell are you?

562
00:33:23.206 --> 00:33:25.541
Pedro.
Didn't Papa call?

563
00:33:25.677 --> 00:33:27.772
No.

564
00:33:27.908 --> 00:33:29.778
Oh. what the heck?
We're roomies now. right?

565
00:33:32.185 --> 00:33:34.786
It's so awesome
to finally meet you.

566
00:33:34.922 --> 00:33:37.915
You're like legends back home.

567
00:33:38.051 --> 00:33:41.892
I say. you both look awesome
for being in your 50s.

568
00:33:42.028 --> 00:33:44.459
And still quite active I see.

569
00:33:47.499 --> 00:33:49.468
Looks like you've been busy.
How much have you moved?

570
00:33:49.603 --> 00:33:52.434
Uh. 100k.

571
00:33:58.277 --> 00:34:01.113
90k. you took your 10%
already. great.

572
00:34:01.978 --> 00:34:04.747
Um...10%?

573
00:34:04.882 --> 00:34:06.116
Yeah. your cut.

574
00:34:06.252 --> 00:34:08.444
Or did Papa negotiate
something else?

575
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.914
Uh. no. it was 10%.

576
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.554
Pedro. why exactly
are you here?

577
00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.121
Does Papa not
trust us anymore?

578
00:34:18.257 --> 00:34:21.596
No. it's nothing like that.
He just sent me to...help.

579
00:34:21.731 --> 00:34:24.702
I mean $20 million is a lot
to move. you know?

580
00:34:24.837 --> 00:34:26.094
20?
20?

581
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.036
Yeah. the rest will be here
later this week.

582
00:34:28.171 --> 00:34:30.167
Now. where's my room?

583
00:34:30.302 --> 00:34:32.076
Uh...

584
00:34:32.212 --> 00:34:35.006
Um. the second door
on the left.

585
00:34:35.142 --> 00:34:36.678
Perfect.

586
00:34:36.814 --> 00:34:38.616
Now. if you'll excuse me.
I'll freshen up for breakfast.

587
00:34:38.751 --> 00:34:40.275
Oh. and. Martha.

588
00:34:40.410 --> 00:34:43.583
I can't wait to taste
your famous country pancakes.

589
00:34:43.718 --> 00:34:46.084
Papa talks about them
all the time.

590
00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:48.017
Great.

591
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.663
You should really open
some windows.

592
00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:54.489
It stinks in here.

593
00:34:54.624 --> 00:34:56.263
How about that?

594
00:34:56.399 --> 00:34:59.363
$20 million.
That's...

595
00:34:59.499 --> 00:35:01.940
Fuck. that's a lot.

596
00:35:02.075 --> 00:35:03.766
I'm gonna go
and take a bath.

597
00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:06.277
Don't even think
about coming in.

598
00:35:09.413 --> 00:35:11.315
What about
the foot massage?

599
00:35:16.955 --> 00:35:18.980
Okay. I hear you.

600
00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:22.084
I will get you
your fucking rent!

601
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.629
Jesus.

602
00:35:25.764 --> 00:35:27.331
Fuck!

603
00:35:38.172 --> 00:35:39.739
Shit!

604
00:35:56.193 --> 00:35:58.994
Tasha. it's me again.

605
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.594
Where the fuck are you?

606
00:36:00.729 --> 00:36:02.328
I've left you
a million voice mails.

607
00:36:02.463 --> 00:36:04.368
Call me the fuck back!

608
00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:15.170
Where is daddy's boy?

609
00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:18.316
He went for a run.

610
00:36:20.616 --> 00:36:22.079
What are we gonna
do with him?

611
00:36:22.215 --> 00:36:24.217
I mean. he can't stay here.
you know that. right?

612
00:36:24.353 --> 00:36:26.388
We can't just kill him.

613
00:36:26.523 --> 00:36:29.353
Did I say that?
I didn't say that.

614
00:36:29.489 --> 00:36:32.020
He's harmless.

615
00:36:32.155 --> 00:36:34.197
Getting rid of him
is just riskier

616
00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:36.598
than just dealing
with him.

617
00:36:36.733 --> 00:36:38.936
Besides. he doesn't seem
to suspect anything.

618
00:36:39.072 --> 00:36:40.738
Yeah. what's up with that?

619
00:36:40.874 --> 00:36:42.799
I don't know.

620
00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:45.244
Guess he thinks
you look 50.

621
00:36:47.842 --> 00:36:49.809
You need to take this
more seriously.

622
00:37:19.746 --> 00:37:20.635
Hello?

623
00:37:20.771 --> 00:37:22.377
Hey. it's me.

624
00:37:22.512 --> 00:37:26.208
Shit. Tasha.
where are you?

625
00:37:26.343 --> 00:37:29.417
Texas. Look. I got your
messages. What's up?

626
00:37:29.552 --> 00:37:32.486
All right. um.
I got your mail.

627
00:37:32.621 --> 00:37:35.051
That's it?
Just toss it.

628
00:37:35.187 --> 00:37:39.698
Okay. uh. and someone came
looking for you.

629
00:37:39.833 --> 00:37:42.827
What? Who?

630
00:37:42.963 --> 00:37:46.195
Some dude.
super fucking creepy.

631
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.338
He looked like one of those
TV preachers

632
00:37:48.474 --> 00:37:51.533
with the white collar
and shit.

633
00:37:51.668 --> 00:37:53.268
When?

634
00:37:55.246 --> 00:37:58.111
When did he stop by?

635
00:37:58.246 --> 00:37:59.511
Um...

636
00:37:59.646 --> 00:38:02.945
Two days ago. I think.

637
00:38:03.081 --> 00:38:06.120
Hold on.
He left you a note.

638
00:38:06.255 --> 00:38:07.721
I found it.

639
00:38:07.857 --> 00:38:09.689
"It's time to come
back home. Natasha.

640
00:38:09.825 --> 00:38:12.929
We forgive you.
You can't run forever.

641
00:38:13.065 --> 00:38:15.096
Love. Roger."

642
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.937
Are you still there?

643
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.136
What did
you tell him?

644
00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:26.774
Shit. Tasha. What the hell
am I supposed to tell him?

645
00:38:26.909 --> 00:38:30.611
I hadn't seen you in months.
I told him that.

646
00:38:30.746 --> 00:38:32.943
He left a number.
Do you want it?

647
00:38:33.079 --> 00:38:34.779
No. no.
Look. if he stops by again.

648
00:38:34.914 --> 00:38:36.985
you never spoke
to me. okay?

649
00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.114
Okay.

650
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.554
Are you coming back
anytime soon?

651
00:38:41.689 --> 00:38:43.252
I'm kind of behind on rent.

652
00:38:48.127 --> 00:38:53.097
Yellow sun. blue sky.
green meadow...

653
00:38:54.407 --> 00:38:56.232
- Hi. Martha.

654
00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:57.842
I didn't mean to scare you.
Are you okay?

655
00:38:57.977 --> 00:38:59.675
Don't touch me!

656
00:39:01.243 --> 00:39:03.173
O-okay.

657
00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:22.027
What's going on with Martha?

658
00:39:23.468 --> 00:39:26.429
You ever met
a pregnant lady?

659
00:39:26.565 --> 00:39:28.198
No.

660
00:39:34.345 --> 00:39:35.775
You doing that right?

661
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.610
Aren't you supposed
to weigh them?

662
00:39:37.746 --> 00:39:39.341
A spoonful
is about right.

663
00:39:44.618 --> 00:39:46.491
I don't know.

664
00:39:47.923 --> 00:39:50.259
Trust me.
No one's gonna weigh them.

665
00:39:50.394 --> 00:39:52.596
This is a lot faster.

666
00:39:54.527 --> 00:39:57.401
I guess.

667
00:39:57.537 --> 00:40:01.636
So. uh. what's
the plan here anyway?

668
00:40:01.772 --> 00:40:05.968
Push 20 mil.
then change scenery?

669
00:40:06.104 --> 00:40:07.806
No. this
will be base camp.

670
00:40:07.942 --> 00:40:09.604
We're going to
expand from here.

671
00:40:09.739 --> 00:40:12.642
Papa trusts me to lead
the North American operations.

672
00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:14.477
Oh. no kidding.

673
00:40:14.613 --> 00:40:16.287
Yep.

674
00:40:16.422 --> 00:40:17.787
Are you sure
he didn't call?

675
00:40:17.922 --> 00:40:20.651
He should've given an update
on the new shipment.

676
00:40:20.787 --> 00:40:24.389
Yeah. No one called.

677
00:40:25.092 --> 00:40:27.730
Look at this.
You missed a call.

678
00:40:29.899 --> 00:40:31.966
- You have one new message.

679
00:40:32.101 --> 00:40:35.337
- <i> Hola.</i>
<i>Bob and Martha. como estas?</i>

680
00:40:35.473 --> 00:40:38.975
<i>How's the Wild West?</i>

681
00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.341
<i>Mika will be there this Friday</i>
<i>with the next shipment.</i>

682
00:40:41.476 --> 00:40:43.108
Tomorrow.

683
00:40:45.348 --> 00:40:49.811
<i>Look. I wanted to thank you.</i>
<i>gracias for babysitting Pedro.</i>

684
00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.788
<i>I owe you one.</i>

685
00:40:51.924 --> 00:40:54.490
<i>I know he can be a little</i>
<i>weird. you know.</i>

686
00:40:54.625 --> 00:40:56.452
<i>with the outfits and stuff.</i>

687
00:40:56.587 --> 00:40:59.796
<i>I trust him.</i>
<i>so just go along with it.</i>

688
00:40:59.931 --> 00:41:03.200
<i>Keep him busy.</i>
<i>he shouldn't get in your way.</i>

689
00:41:03.336 --> 00:41:05.232
<i>I'll make it up to you.</i>

690
00:41:05.368 --> 00:41:08.837
<i>A couple weeks at my Cancun</i>
<i>resort should do it. eh?</i>

691
00:41:08.972 --> 00:41:11.403
<i>Gracias.</i>
<i>Talk soon.</i>

692
00:41:11.538 --> 00:41:14.207
So...

693
00:41:14.343 --> 00:41:16.037
Friday.

694
00:41:42.175 --> 00:41:44.572
Enjoying the view?

695
00:41:44.707 --> 00:41:47.703
Yeah. it's nice
I guess.

696
00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.548
Whoa!

697
00:41:51.044 --> 00:41:53.710
Is it a laddie
or lassie?

698
00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:54.911
Excuse me?

699
00:41:55.046 --> 00:41:56.913
Is it a boy or a girl?

700
00:41:57.048 --> 00:42:00.090
Oh. um. we don't know.

701
00:42:00.225 --> 00:42:02.119
You don't know?

702
00:42:02.255 --> 00:42:04.752
Don't tell me
you're one of those.

703
00:42:04.888 --> 00:42:06.289
Those...

704
00:42:06.425 --> 00:42:09.524
You know. one of those
flaky. airy fairy types

705
00:42:09.659 --> 00:42:12.965
that let their kids
choose their own gender.

706
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.732
Like we got
a goddamn choice.

707
00:42:15.868 --> 00:42:19.102
Right. Those.

708
00:42:19.237 --> 00:42:22.513
You're
the new owners then.

709
00:42:22.649 --> 00:42:25.777
Yep. yep.
we're the new owners.

710
00:42:25.912 --> 00:42:27.881
Well. welcome to Reno!

711
00:42:28.017 --> 00:42:30.716
The biggest little city
or whatever

712
00:42:30.851 --> 00:42:32.288
Goddamn shit they say.

713
00:42:32.423 --> 00:42:34.122
What's your name?

714
00:42:34.258 --> 00:42:35.257
Martha.

715
00:42:35.392 --> 00:42:37.518
Martha. eh?

716
00:42:37.654 --> 00:42:42.063
Cole T. Baxter.
Nice to finally meet you.

717
00:42:42.198 --> 00:42:46.027
You know. we don't get a lot of
new faces around here.

718
00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:48.871
Especially pretty ones.

719
00:42:49.907 --> 00:42:53.739
Nice to meet you. Cole.
I'm gonna go.

720
00:42:53.875 --> 00:42:57.176
See you around.
Martha.

721
00:43:06.951 --> 00:43:08.651
- You okay?

722
00:43:08.787 --> 00:43:11.458
Go away.

723
00:43:11.593 --> 00:43:13.324
Hey. man.

724
00:43:13.459 --> 00:43:16.866
whatever's going on.
it's going to be okay.

725
00:43:17.996 --> 00:43:20.503
I mean. shit.

726
00:43:20.638 --> 00:43:24.071
my own dad was a major asshole.

727
00:43:28.307 --> 00:43:31.342
He used to hit me
and my mom.

728
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:44.762
I remember once he beat
the shit out of me so hard.

729
00:43:45.728 --> 00:43:48.495
he broke a few ribs.

730
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:50.768
That's horrible.

731
00:43:51.929 --> 00:43:54.667
Yeah.

732
00:43:54.802 --> 00:43:56.367
I hated that dude.

733
00:43:58.611 --> 00:44:00.338
I'm never gonna
be like that.

734
00:44:03.207 --> 00:44:04.848
I'm gonna be a good dad.

735
00:44:07.847 --> 00:44:10.220
Yeah. you will.

736
00:44:10.356 --> 00:44:12.722
I can see it.

737
00:44:12.857 --> 00:44:15.389
You're both going to be
great parents.

738
00:44:15.524 --> 00:44:17.421
Yeah.

739
00:44:17.556 --> 00:44:21.997
I mean. Natasha's harsh.
but she means well.

740
00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:25.662
Who's Natasha?

741
00:44:25.798 --> 00:44:28.238
Huh?

742
00:44:28.373 --> 00:44:29.871
I meant Martha.

743
00:44:30.007 --> 00:44:34.140
The point is
some dads are assholes.

744
00:44:34.276 --> 00:44:37.208
and you don't need
to earn his respect.

745
00:44:37.344 --> 00:44:39.343
And you don't need
shit from him.

746
00:44:39.478 --> 00:44:43.183
If he's not proud of you.
then fuck him.

747
00:44:44.785 --> 00:44:47.215
Yeah. Fuck him.

748
00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:50.058
Yeah.
Screw that dude.

749
00:44:56.598 --> 00:44:58.092
Here.

750
00:44:58.227 --> 00:45:00.136
What's this?

751
00:45:00.272 --> 00:45:02.064
Whiskey.

752
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.402
The cure for everything.

753
00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.107
Good stuff?

754
00:45:15.014 --> 00:45:17.547
Potent. but good.

755
00:45:18.885 --> 00:45:20.891
Feeling better?

756
00:45:26.265 --> 00:45:28.624
Okay.

757
00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:31.799
Now. let's get ready
for that next shipment.

758
00:45:31.934 --> 00:45:33.800
Show your dad how it's done.

759
00:45:33.936 --> 00:45:35.434
Oh. I almost
forgot.

760
00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.868
Mika called. he's a day early.
He'll be here today.

761
00:45:38.003 --> 00:45:39.207
Oh. That's good.

762
00:45:39.342 --> 00:45:41.804
Yeah. he can't wait to see
you and Martha again.

763
00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.241
Huh?

764
00:45:43.377 --> 00:45:44.606
Yeah. he said it's been
like two years.

765
00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:47.647
You've got a lot of
catching up to do.

766
00:45:47.782 --> 00:45:50.613
Sh-h-h-h-it.

767
00:45:52.957 --> 00:45:56.423
What did he say exactly?

768
00:45:56.559 --> 00:46:00.832
That it's been two years and he
can't wait to see us again.

769
00:46:03.832 --> 00:46:05.198
We're fucked.

770
00:46:05.333 --> 00:46:07.035
Oh. my God. Vern.
he's gonna fucking

771
00:46:07.171 --> 00:46:09.136
waltz right in here.
and we're fucked!

772
00:46:09.272 --> 00:46:10.867
No. no. we can figure out
something else.

773
00:46:11.002 --> 00:46:13.170
Jesus Christ. Vern. What the
fuck are we gonna figure out?

774
00:46:13.305 --> 00:46:16.846
We can...
We can...

775
00:46:16.982 --> 00:46:19.712
Fuck. I don't know.
I don't know!

776
00:46:19.847 --> 00:46:22.744
Fuck this.

777
00:46:25.256 --> 00:46:27.516
What are you doing?
Carpe fucking Diem. Vern.

778
00:46:27.652 --> 00:46:30.284
I'm getting
the fuck out of here!

779
00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.989
You're not serious.

780
00:46:33.124 --> 00:46:35.164
You're serious.

781
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:40.161
You are gonna steal drugs from
the Mexican cartel.

782
00:46:40.296 --> 00:46:42.368
Are you insane?!

783
00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.048
We walk out of here
with it. we're dead.

784
00:46:56.087 --> 00:46:57.855
Vern. I am not
throwing away our future.

785
00:46:57.991 --> 00:47:01.854
Come on. baby.
we can still have a future.

786
00:47:01.989 --> 00:47:04.087
But not like this.

787
00:47:04.223 --> 00:47:06.090
Let's just go. baby.

788
00:47:06.226 --> 00:47:08.323
Please.
Let's just go.

789
00:47:11.399 --> 00:47:14.437
Hey.
What's going on?

790
00:47:14.572 --> 00:47:16.402
Not much.

791
00:47:29.648 --> 00:47:32.154
Oh. my God. he's here.
Get him out.

792
00:47:37.053 --> 00:47:41.330
Hey. buddy. I need your help
with something outside.

793
00:47:41.466 --> 00:47:42.333
You do?

794
00:47:42.468 --> 00:47:43.896
Yeah. right now.

795
00:47:44.032 --> 00:47:45.829
I'm really thirsty.

796
00:47:45.964 --> 00:47:47.733
Oh. no. No time for that.
Come on. buddy. let's go.

797
00:47:47.868 --> 00:47:49.173
But --

798
00:47:49.308 --> 00:47:50.407
No. we got to get started.
Come on. buddy. Let's go!

799
00:47:50.543 --> 00:47:51.435
Can I just --

800
00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:52.705
Pedro. just get
the fuck outside!

801
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.440
Okay.

802
00:48:06.021 --> 00:48:07.717
Hi. You must be Mika.

803
00:48:12.722 --> 00:48:15.329
Where are
Martha and Bob?

804
00:48:15.465 --> 00:48:18.761
Uh. out. Shopping.
They should be back soon.

805
00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.984
Oh. don't mind that.
I was just cleaning.

806
00:48:42.693 --> 00:48:44.660
Who are you?

807
00:48:44.796 --> 00:48:46.558
I'm Martha's niece.

808
00:48:46.693 --> 00:48:48.631
Feel free to have a seat
and wait over there.

809
00:48:48.766 --> 00:48:50.964
I'd rather stand.

810
00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:53.499
Uh. yeah. okay.
Sure.

811
00:48:58.603 --> 00:49:01.309
Um. I'm --
I'm gonna pee.

812
00:49:14.791 --> 00:49:16.657
Oh. Jesus.

813
00:49:16.792 --> 00:49:18.187
Okay.

814
00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:19.624
Oh. pills.

815
00:49:24.034 --> 00:49:26.895
What the fuck are these guys on?

816
00:49:29.003 --> 00:49:31.471
Okay. all right.

817
00:49:38.918 --> 00:49:40.979
You want me
to do what?

818
00:49:41.114 --> 00:49:42.680
- Fix this.

819
00:49:44.283 --> 00:49:45.456
But it's July.

820
00:49:45.591 --> 00:49:47.181
Yeah. Now.

821
00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:51.323
Winter's coming. and it'll
be here sooner than you think.

822
00:49:51.458 --> 00:49:53.062
Well. what's
wrong with it?

823
00:49:53.198 --> 00:49:55.297
That's what we got
to figure out.

824
00:50:01.765 --> 00:50:04.136
I guess we could
fill the tires.

825
00:50:04.271 --> 00:50:06.770
That is a great idea!

826
00:50:11.811 --> 00:50:13.775
Uh. so would you like
anything to drink?

827
00:50:13.911 --> 00:50:17.412
We have water.
apple juice. whiskey.

828
00:50:17.548 --> 00:50:19.850
Apple juice is fine.

829
00:50:20.486 --> 00:50:23.424
Okay.
Coming right up.

830
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:54.416
All right.
Here we are.

831
00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:56.787
Refreshing apple juice.

832
00:51:08.435 --> 00:51:11.505
Excuse me for one second.

833
00:51:31.292 --> 00:51:33.964
Hey. Vern. come here.

834
00:51:34.099 --> 00:51:36.358
Keep up
the good work. buddy.

835
00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:39.236
Hurry up!

836
00:51:39.371 --> 00:51:40.837
Jesus Christ. Vern.
could you go any slower?

837
00:51:40.972 --> 00:51:42.973
Hey. what's going on?

838
00:51:43.108 --> 00:51:44.307
I drugged him.
You what?

839
00:51:44.442 --> 00:51:45.667
I gave him enough Ambien
to drop an elephant.

840
00:51:45.803 --> 00:51:47.076
He should
be out in five.

841
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:48.444
Hey.
Yeah. that should work.

842
00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.114
Yeah. you just got to
get daddy's boy out of here.

843
00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.778
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with him?

844
00:51:51.913 --> 00:51:55.180
Who the fuck cares. Vern?
Just get him out of here.

845
00:51:55.316 --> 00:51:56.415
Where is he anyway?

846
00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:58.688
He's fixing
the snowblower.

847
00:51:58.823 --> 00:51:59.688
That snowblower?

848
00:51:59.823 --> 00:52:00.681
Yeah.

849
00:52:00.816 --> 00:52:01.690
My God. Jesus Christ.

850
00:52:01.825 --> 00:52:02.685
Shit!

851
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:04.921
Christ. Vern.
you had one job.

852
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.527
Fuck!

853
00:52:41.795 --> 00:52:44.691
Pedro.
the snowblower?

854
00:52:44.827 --> 00:52:46.301
I'm just taking a break.

855
00:52:46.436 --> 00:52:48.401
Is that Mika's car
by the gate?

856
00:52:48.536 --> 00:52:51.875
Did you just
drink that?

857
00:52:52.378 --> 00:52:55.576
Uh-huh. Kind of tasted
like shit though.

858
00:52:59.215 --> 00:53:01.177
I don't feel well. Bob.

859
00:53:01.313 --> 00:53:02.345
Bob?

860
00:53:41.254 --> 00:53:43.052
Shit.

861
00:54:13.588 --> 00:54:15.491
- Jesus.

862
00:54:43.184 --> 00:54:44.553
Martha?

863
00:54:50.655 --> 00:54:54.090
It's so cold.

864
00:55:45.413 --> 00:55:48.016
How's daddy's boy?

865
00:55:48.151 --> 00:55:49.750
Still sleeping.

866
00:55:52.685 --> 00:55:54.017
After I'm done here.

867
00:55:54.153 --> 00:55:57.156
we can ditch his cellphone
and his car.

868
00:55:57.291 --> 00:55:58.858
Okay.

869
00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:15.105
You know.
it's not too late.

870
00:56:16.238 --> 00:56:18.273
We can still
just take off.

871
00:56:18.409 --> 00:56:21.608
Oh. what?
And miss all this fun?

872
00:56:21.744 --> 00:56:24.884
No. seriously. Vern. we've come
too far to turn back now.

873
00:56:25.019 --> 00:56:26.952
and I am not leaving
without that money.

874
00:56:29.626 --> 00:56:32.793
Whatever you say.

875
00:56:34.458 --> 00:56:37.568
I just hope we don't have
anymore surprises.

876
00:56:37.703 --> 00:56:40.966
Good Lord. Vern. What else
could possibly go wrong?

877
00:57:15.207 --> 00:57:16.435
Do you have the money?

878
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:18.108
Did you find her?

879
00:57:18.243 --> 00:57:20.768
Yeah. she's in Texas.

880
00:57:20.903 --> 00:57:22.474
Where in Texas?

881
00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:24.941
She gave me an address.

882
00:57:25.076 --> 00:57:27.210
Here. that's
where she is.

883
00:57:30.517 --> 00:57:31.949
And my message?

884
00:57:32.084 --> 00:57:33.948
Don't worry.
I gave it to her.

885
00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:35.817
Did she say anything?

886
00:57:35.953 --> 00:57:37.657
You know. she was happy.

887
00:57:37.793 --> 00:57:39.387
Can't wait
to see you again.

888
00:57:42.124 --> 00:57:43.396
Is that what she said?

889
00:57:43.532 --> 00:57:46.334
Uh-huh. absolutely.

890
00:57:46.469 --> 00:57:48.066
So where's the money?

891
00:57:55.481 --> 00:57:57.509
Let me know if you need
anything else.

892
00:57:57.645 --> 00:57:59.674
I have Benzoes. Oxys...

893
00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.112
Oxys?

894
00:58:01.247 --> 00:58:04.654
Yeah. oxys.
$10 a pill. best deal in town.

895
00:58:05.948 --> 00:58:08.689
Let's pray.

896
00:58:08.825 --> 00:58:11.018
Tell me. are you
a God fearing woman?

897
00:58:11.153 --> 00:58:12.827
Yeah. sure. Whatever.

898
00:58:16.196 --> 00:58:18.860
And the Spirit of the Lord
has made me...

899
00:58:20.873 --> 00:58:23.701
...and the breath of the
Almighty gives me strength.

900
00:58:51.032 --> 00:58:54.033
Let's see if we can find
Natasha on here.

901
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:58.270
We got the number.

902
00:58:58.406 --> 00:59:00.336
Perfect.

903
00:59:22.232 --> 00:59:23.766
Got it?

904
00:59:28.899 --> 00:59:30.338
And the address?

905
00:59:30.473 --> 00:59:32.104
You got the money?

906
00:59:43.946 --> 00:59:45.579
Wait!

907
00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:54.093
Did you see him there? Hm?

908
00:59:55.126 --> 00:59:56.599
No.
Are you sure?

909
00:59:56.735 --> 00:59:59.294
He's your contact.
Bob Treadway.

910
00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:02.904
That's not Bob.
He's a younger fellow.

911
01:00:06.312 --> 01:00:09.403
What about her? Hm?

912
01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:13.281
Nah. I only
saw a younger chick.

913
01:00:13.417 --> 01:00:15.617
Blonde. cute.

914
01:00:15.752 --> 01:00:17.277
There was no one
there. huh.

915
01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:20.014
There was nobody else inside.

916
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:22.455
Not that I know of.

917
01:00:22.590 --> 01:00:23.789
You sure?

918
01:00:23.925 --> 01:00:25.993
Yeah. I'm sure.

919
01:01:04.533 --> 01:01:05.868
Martha. my dear.

920
01:01:06.004 --> 01:01:08.503
I thought I'd finally
drop over for a visit.

921
01:01:08.639 --> 01:01:10.864
I baked you some cookies.

922
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.336
Thanks.

923
01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:17.510
I've never seen this place
from the inside.

924
01:01:17.645 --> 01:01:19.640
Real nice.

925
01:01:21.147 --> 01:01:22.519
Maybe you can
give me a tour.

926
01:01:22.654 --> 01:01:23.683
Now's not really
a good time.

927
01:01:23.818 --> 01:01:24.980
- Hey. Sugarplum!

928
01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:26.182
Have you seen my phone?

929
01:01:26.317 --> 01:01:28.649
Bob. honey.
we have a guest.

930
01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:34.921
Cole T. Baxter.

931
01:01:35.057 --> 01:01:36.162
Uh-huh.

932
01:01:36.297 --> 01:01:38.797
Nice to meet you. Bob.
Can I call you Bob?

933
01:01:38.932 --> 01:01:40.595
Well. that's my name.

934
01:01:42.037 --> 01:01:44.039
I was just
telling Martha here

935
01:01:44.174 --> 01:01:47.644
that I've never seen
this place from the inside.

936
01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.646
Yeah. there's not much
to see here.

937
01:01:49.782 --> 01:01:52.080
Oh. I don't believe that
for a second.

938
01:01:52.215 --> 01:01:53.617
You know. thank you so much
for these cookies.

939
01:01:53.753 --> 01:01:56.243
but we are actually
really busy.

940
01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.820
More work on the backyard?

941
01:01:58.956 --> 01:02:01.715
Yeah. I noticed
you've been busy. huh.

942
01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:04.519
What do you want?

943
01:02:04.655 --> 01:02:06.724
Oh. Bob. you don't want
to be doing that.

944
01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.392
Yeah. why not?

945
01:02:08.527 --> 01:02:13.529
Well. because that would
make this a bit messy.

946
01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:17.301
You see this trigger?

947
01:02:17.437 --> 01:02:21.201
If I let go of my finger.
it's boom time.

948
01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:23.576
No more Bob and Martha.

949
01:02:23.711 --> 01:02:25.649
That's not real.

950
01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:28.949
Only one way
to find out. huh?

951
01:02:29.085 --> 01:02:31.078
This is a nice setup
you got here.

952
01:02:31.213 --> 01:02:33.255
What is it?

953
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:35.191
Crack?

954
01:02:35.326 --> 01:02:36.983
Meth?

955
01:02:37.119 --> 01:02:38.521
Cocaine?

956
01:02:40.057 --> 01:02:41.691
Ah. cocaine.

957
01:02:41.827 --> 01:02:43.625
Not bad.

958
01:02:45.234 --> 01:02:48.101
Yuppies make great
customers. am I right?

959
01:02:48.236 --> 01:02:50.103
More reliable
than those meth heads.

960
01:02:50.238 --> 01:02:51.698
Just tell us what
the fuck you want.

961
01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:53.034
Straight to the business.
huh. Bob?

962
01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:55.774
I like that.

963
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:59.144
Well. I need you to. uh.

964
01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.816
take care of
a little problem for me.

965
01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:04.049
What kind
of little problem?

966
01:03:04.184 --> 01:03:05.683
Have a cookie.
You'll see.

967
01:03:05.818 --> 01:03:07.418
What?

968
01:03:10.395 --> 01:03:12.157
Who is she?

969
01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:15.129
The hack
who murdered my wife.

970
01:03:16.396 --> 01:03:20.369
Doctor. if you want to
call her that.

971
01:03:20.504 --> 01:03:22.839
Sarah Wilkinson.

972
01:03:22.974 --> 01:03:24.305
And what does she have
to do with us?

973
01:03:24.441 --> 01:03:26.635
Well...

974
01:03:27.778 --> 01:03:30.874
...because I want you to...

975
01:03:31.009 --> 01:03:33.211
kill her for me.

976
01:03:33.347 --> 01:03:35.682
Bob. where are you.
motherfucker?

977
01:03:48.129 --> 01:03:51.061
Hi. Andrea.
What's up?

978
01:03:51.196 --> 01:03:52.600
- Where are you?

979
01:03:52.735 --> 01:03:54.366
Home. Where else?

980
01:03:54.502 --> 01:03:57.501
Cut the bullshit.
I know you're not at home.

981
01:03:57.637 --> 01:03:59.505
You're going after
the Treadways. aren't you?

982
01:03:59.641 --> 01:04:00.875
So what?

983
01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:03.109
Goddamit. Cooper!
Let it go!

984
01:04:03.245 --> 01:04:05.549
Evan specifically
told you not to.

985
01:04:05.684 --> 01:04:06.848
You're gonna lose your job.

986
01:04:06.983 --> 01:04:09.083
Yeah. thanks
for the warning.

987
01:04:09.219 --> 01:04:11.851
This is not gonna bring
back your partner.

988
01:04:11.986 --> 01:04:13.151
He wouldn't want this.

989
01:04:13.286 --> 01:04:15.893
His name was Jason.
Okay?

990
01:04:16.028 --> 01:04:18.319
And you have no idea
what he would want.

991
01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.096
Jesus Christ. Cooper.

992
01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:22.891
If you're gonna do this.
let's do it the right way.

993
01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:26.700
Yeah. yeah. 'cause it worked
so well the last time. hm?

994
01:04:26.836 --> 01:04:28.728
At least get backup.

995
01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:31.166
I'll think about it.
I got to go.

996
01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:32.833
Don't you hang --

997
01:04:33.675 --> 01:04:34.940
Okay.

998
01:04:35.076 --> 01:04:37.179
Let me get this straight.

999
01:04:37.314 --> 01:04:41.043
This doctor lady who treated
your wife and she died.

1000
01:04:41.178 --> 01:04:42.212
She killed her.

1001
01:04:42.347 --> 01:04:45.278
Yeah. all right. She killed her.

1002
01:04:45.413 --> 01:04:47.153
Killed her.

1003
01:04:47.289 --> 01:04:51.788
So now you want us to go
and whack her?

1004
01:04:51.924 --> 01:04:53.489
Yes!

1005
01:04:53.625 --> 01:04:55.758
Shouldn't be too big
of a problem.

1006
01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.660
based on all the activity
you've been having.

1007
01:04:57.795 --> 01:04:59.402
You know. we're not just
some fucking wholesale

1008
01:04:59.537 --> 01:05:01.434
assassins. okay?

1009
01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:05.474
If you want her dead.
hire someone or do it yourself.

1010
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.740
Martha. relax.

1011
01:05:07.875 --> 01:05:09.940
No. she's right.

1012
01:05:10.075 --> 01:05:11.613
Do it yourself.

1013
01:05:11.749 --> 01:05:13.279
Look. the way I see it.

1014
01:05:13.415 --> 01:05:16.281
you got a nice little operation
going on here.

1015
01:05:16.417 --> 01:05:19.418
Lots of money exchanging
hands. I assume.

1016
01:05:19.553 --> 01:05:22.983
You already got a pet cemetery
in the backyard.

1017
01:05:23.118 --> 01:05:26.260
so what's one more
to keep this going on. right?

1018
01:05:27.625 --> 01:05:31.301
Or I'll just go
and call the cops.

1019
01:05:31.436 --> 01:05:33.300
Okay.

1020
01:05:33.435 --> 01:05:36.899
Let's just say for now
we'll consider it.

1021
01:05:37.035 --> 01:05:39.341
Then what happens after we take
care of your little problem?

1022
01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:42.170
You're just gonna go away
and not tell anyone about us?

1023
01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:43.640
We're neighbors.

1024
01:05:43.775 --> 01:05:46.310
None of my business
what you do around here.

1025
01:05:46.446 --> 01:05:48.876
A little too late
for that.

1026
01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:51.687
So you take care of
a little problem for me

1027
01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:54.890
and just call it a favor.

1028
01:05:55.026 --> 01:05:56.724
How do we know
we can trust you?

1029
01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.990
Martha. Martha. Martha.

1030
01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:01.064
Have I ever lied to you?

1031
01:06:01.199 --> 01:06:04.697
You're crazy. and we
are not doing this.

1032
01:06:04.832 --> 01:06:06.169
Okay?

1033
01:06:06.304 --> 01:06:10.735
We're not actually thinking
about doing this?

1034
01:06:10.871 --> 01:06:12.338
Are we?

1035
01:06:12.473 --> 01:06:15.273
He hasn't exactly
given us options.

1036
01:06:15.409 --> 01:06:16.976
She makes
a good point. Bob.

1037
01:06:17.112 --> 01:06:18.206
You can go fuck yourself.

1038
01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:20.682
Hey. come here.

1039
01:06:20.817 --> 01:06:23.211
Yeah. go and chat.

1040
01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:24.851
I'll wait.

1041
01:06:24.987 --> 01:06:26.287
Now this is insane.

1042
01:06:26.422 --> 01:06:28.286
We can't just go around town
shooting people.

1043
01:06:28.421 --> 01:06:30.186
It's not people.
it's one person.

1044
01:06:30.322 --> 01:06:31.385
Who killed someone.

1045
01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.453
Yeah. so he says.

1046
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:34.890
You don't even know her.

1047
01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:37.559
Exactly. So I have no reason
to shoot her either.

1048
01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:39.002
Vern. what else
are we gonna do?

1049
01:06:39.137 --> 01:06:41.302
He's not exactly
giving us options here.

1050
01:06:41.437 --> 01:06:44.271
All right. what if.
now just hear me out.

1051
01:06:44.407 --> 01:06:47.610
what if we tell him
that we'll do it.

1052
01:06:47.746 --> 01:06:49.242
then we get in the car.

1053
01:06:49.377 --> 01:06:52.007
we get the fuck
out of this city.

1054
01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:57.112
- Oh. and before I forget.
only one of you goes.

1055
01:06:57.681 --> 01:07:00.254
The other one stays here
with me.

1056
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:02.617
And I'm not talking
about the big boy.

1057
01:07:02.752 --> 01:07:03.855
I fucking
hate that guy.

1058
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:05.021
Focus.

1059
01:07:05.156 --> 01:07:06.419
Okay.

1060
01:07:06.554 --> 01:07:08.054
We are so close

1061
01:07:08.189 --> 01:07:09.796
to getting that money
and starting a new life.

1062
01:07:09.932 --> 01:07:12.396
Yeah. I guess.

1063
01:07:12.531 --> 01:07:14.532
What's wrong?

1064
01:07:14.667 --> 01:07:16.898
Nothing. she just
kicked extra hard.

1065
01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:27.007
Okay.

1066
01:07:29.016 --> 01:07:30.846
I'll do it.

1067
01:07:33.692 --> 01:07:36.723
Are you sure?

1068
01:07:36.858 --> 01:07:38.891
Yeah.

1069
01:07:39.026 --> 01:07:40.724
I'm sure.

1070
01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:44.962
All right. here's the deal.
you motherfucker.

1071
01:07:45.097 --> 01:07:47.263
Guys?

1072
01:07:47.398 --> 01:07:49.604
Pedro. You're up.

1073
01:07:49.739 --> 01:07:51.666
Yeah.

1074
01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:54.139
What's going on?
Where's Mika?

1075
01:07:54.274 --> 01:07:55.175
He left.
He's gone.

1076
01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:58.174
Yeah.
he's left all right.

1077
01:07:58.310 --> 01:07:59.843
What happened?

1078
01:07:59.978 --> 01:08:02.317
I don't know. buddy.
You just kind of hit the floor.

1079
01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:04.682
I did?

1080
01:08:04.817 --> 01:08:07.152
Yeah. you had us scared
there for a moment.

1081
01:08:07.287 --> 01:08:08.822
You were out all day.

1082
01:08:08.957 --> 01:08:10.589
How's your head?

1083
01:08:11.993 --> 01:08:13.326
It hurts.

1084
01:08:13.462 --> 01:08:14.921
- You really got
to be careful.

1085
01:08:15.057 --> 01:08:17.667
Most accidents happen
in the home.

1086
01:08:19.701 --> 01:08:22.238
Come on. Pedro. let's get some
ice for your head.

1087
01:08:23.636 --> 01:08:25.274
You'll be
all right. buddy.

1088
01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:32.848
So...do we have a deal?

1089
01:08:32.983 --> 01:08:34.275
Yeah. we have a deal.

1090
01:08:34.410 --> 01:08:35.479
Great.

1091
01:08:35.614 --> 01:08:38.084
The address
is on the back.

1092
01:08:38.219 --> 01:08:39.446
Oh. and I want proof.

1093
01:08:39.581 --> 01:08:40.921
What proof?

1094
01:08:41.057 --> 01:08:44.358
A photo. a finger. body.

1095
01:08:44.493 --> 01:08:46.529
Whatever your imagination
comes up with.

1096
01:08:46.664 --> 01:08:48.061
Fine.

1097
01:08:48.196 --> 01:08:49.957
Oh. and take the kid.

1098
01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:51.531
I'm not in the mood
for babysitting.

1099
01:08:51.666 --> 01:08:53.001
What the hell am I supposed
to tell him?

1100
01:08:53.137 --> 01:08:54.637
Not my problem.
Improvise.

1101
01:08:54.772 --> 01:08:55.638
Okay. listen --

1102
01:08:55.773 --> 01:08:58.567
Ah. ah. ah!

1103
01:08:58.703 --> 01:09:00.676
Pedro.
let's take a drive.

1104
01:09:00.811 --> 01:09:02.140
- Huh? Why?

1105
01:09:02.275 --> 01:09:04.171
Pedro. just get --

1106
01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:07.340
Pedro. just do me this favor
and get in the car.

1107
01:09:07.476 --> 01:09:09.343
Please.

1108
01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:11.045
Okay.

1109
01:09:22.967 --> 01:09:25.401
Where are we going?

1110
01:09:25.537 --> 01:09:29.033
To lose the last little bit of
self respect I have.

1111
01:09:29.168 --> 01:09:31.474
What?

1112
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:34.205
Nothing.

1113
01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.905
Buckle up. buddy.

1114
01:09:54.061 --> 01:09:56.289
Relax.

1115
01:09:56.424 --> 01:10:00.197
You're gonna go into labor
with all that pacing.

1116
01:10:00.333 --> 01:10:01.898
Have a cookie.

1117
01:10:14.012 --> 01:10:17.287
You think you ought to be
doing that?

1118
01:10:17.422 --> 01:10:20.389
The Surgeon General says
it's not good for you.

1119
01:10:21.691 --> 01:10:24.294
Says the man who's
holding me hostage with a bomb.

1120
01:10:35.031 --> 01:10:37.130
So. what's your name?

1121
01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:39.804
You already know my name.
It's Martha.

1122
01:10:39.939 --> 01:10:43.942
Oh. come on.
Aren't we past all that already?

1123
01:10:44.444 --> 01:10:46.074
What's your real name?

1124
01:10:49.952 --> 01:10:52.511
Natasha.

1125
01:10:52.647 --> 01:10:54.615
Natasha.

1126
01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.688
Tasha.

1127
01:10:56.823 --> 01:10:59.593
Natasha.
I like it.

1128
01:11:05.931 --> 01:11:07.464
How long do we need
to wait here?

1129
01:11:07.599 --> 01:11:09.869
Until she comes home.

1130
01:11:10.005 --> 01:11:11.638
Who?

1131
01:11:16.309 --> 01:11:17.643
Who is she?

1132
01:11:17.778 --> 01:11:21.780
I don't know.
just some doctor lady.

1133
01:11:21.916 --> 01:11:26.584
Why are we here?
Did Mika ask us to do this?

1134
01:11:26.719 --> 01:11:29.986
Yeah. that's it.
It was Mika.

1135
01:11:36.465 --> 01:11:39.528
So what's with
the truck. Bob?

1136
01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:41.302
What do you mean?

1137
01:11:41.437 --> 01:11:45.098
I mean.
it's a little vintage.

1138
01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:47.038
There's nothing wrong
with Bessie.

1139
01:11:47.174 --> 01:11:48.272
Bessie?

1140
01:11:48.408 --> 01:11:50.012
Yeah. Bessie.

1141
01:11:50.147 --> 01:11:52.207
She still runs great.

1142
01:11:52.342 --> 01:11:56.683
I guess. I mean. if that's
your only criteria.

1143
01:11:56.819 --> 01:11:59.553
I've had
her since high school.

1144
01:11:59.689 --> 01:12:02.925
They don't make them
like this anymore.

1145
01:12:03.061 --> 01:12:04.925
You're right about that?

1146
01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.858
What?

1147
01:12:06.993 --> 01:12:09.897
Do you think I need
to get a new truck?

1148
01:12:10.032 --> 01:12:11.665
Maybe.

1149
01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:21.243
- Why are you
so worried?

1150
01:12:21.378 --> 01:12:24.407
Afraid he'll
screw it up?

1151
01:12:24.543 --> 01:12:26.145
Or ditch you?

1152
01:12:26.281 --> 01:12:28.250
Of course not.

1153
01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:31.914
Well. then relax.
He'll be back.

1154
01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:34.985
He's not gonna ditch
his own kid.

1155
01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:42.588
What's wrong?

1156
01:12:42.724 --> 01:12:44.566
Nothing.

1157
01:12:46.203 --> 01:12:48.504
No. it's something.

1158
01:12:54.244 --> 01:12:56.710
It's not his kid. is it?

1159
01:13:00.613 --> 01:13:03.648
Well. I'll be damned.

1160
01:13:03.783 --> 01:13:07.819
And he's still
sticking around?

1161
01:13:07.954 --> 01:13:09.890
Well. he's a bigger man
than I realized.

1162
01:13:10.026 --> 01:13:11.223
Shut up!

1163
01:13:11.359 --> 01:13:13.989
No. I mean it.

1164
01:13:14.125 --> 01:13:17.123
Taking care
of another man's kid?

1165
01:13:17.258 --> 01:13:19.892
Not many men
would do that.

1166
01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:21.465
I know I sure wouldn't.

1167
01:13:21.601 --> 01:13:22.969
Yeah. no surprise there.

1168
01:13:23.105 --> 01:13:24.604
Hey.

1169
01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:27.642
I know I got flaws.

1170
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:32.146
I never said
I was perfect.

1171
01:13:32.281 --> 01:13:34.477
And I never will.

1172
01:13:34.613 --> 01:13:37.253
But your guy.

1173
01:13:37.388 --> 01:13:40.652
he doesn't
sound too bad.

1174
01:13:40.787 --> 01:13:42.987
That's some
true love there.

1175
01:13:48.231 --> 01:13:50.467
Do you have kids?

1176
01:13:56.197 --> 01:13:58.233
My wife was pregnant once.

1177
01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:02.611
And it was a boy.

1178
01:14:05.176 --> 01:14:08.485
We named him
Daniel Travis Baxter.

1179
01:14:10.287 --> 01:14:12.379
Now that was a name.

1180
01:14:13.650 --> 01:14:15.283
Was?

1181
01:14:18.986 --> 01:14:20.563
We lost him.

1182
01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.360
One week before
the due date.

1183
01:14:30.031 --> 01:14:31.673
What happened?

1184
01:14:35.578 --> 01:14:37.844
He had some sort
of heart defect

1185
01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:42.779
or some other God damn shit
the doctor said.

1186
01:14:42.915 --> 01:14:46.083
He never
even had a chance.

1187
01:14:46.519 --> 01:14:48.921
I'm sorry.

1188
01:14:49.858 --> 01:14:54.056
Yeah. well. life is what
it is. you know.

1189
01:14:54.192 --> 01:14:58.029
His life just wasn't
meant to be.

1190
01:15:01.136 --> 01:15:06.103
But me and Elizabeth.
we got through it together.

1191
01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:10.912
As best as you can.

1192
01:15:11.515 --> 01:15:14.782
It wasn't easy.
but we did it.

1193
01:15:16.319 --> 01:15:18.417
We had each other.

1194
01:15:19.053 --> 01:15:22.559
Until that hack doctor
took her from me.

1195
01:15:27.531 --> 01:15:30.094
It wasn't
her time to go.

1196
01:15:31.428 --> 01:15:35.070
It wasn't supposed
to happen like that!

1197
01:15:35.205 --> 01:15:37.000
It's okay. hey.

1198
01:15:37.136 --> 01:15:39.666
It's okay. it's okay.
It's okay.

1199
01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:41.611
Oh.

1200
01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:47.342
I'm sorry.

1201
01:15:57.922 --> 01:15:59.926
- Is that her?

1202
01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:06.966
Yeah. it has to be.

1203
01:16:08.103 --> 01:16:11.003
Okay. so. what are we supposed
to do exactly?

1204
01:16:14.544 --> 01:16:17.512
What -- What's that for?!

1205
01:16:17.648 --> 01:16:21.442
Pedro. I'm not
gonna lie to you.

1206
01:16:22.584 --> 01:16:24.451
We're gonna kill her.

1207
01:16:24.586 --> 01:16:26.150
We're gonna what now?

1208
01:16:29.153 --> 01:16:30.459
You're not
serious. right?

1209
01:16:30.594 --> 01:16:32.761
Just keep an eye
on the road.

1210
01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:37.599
You two shut up.
just everybody shut up!

1211
01:16:37.735 --> 01:16:38.897
Shut the fuck up!
I have money.

1212
01:16:39.033 --> 01:16:40.632
I don't want
your God damn money.

1213
01:16:40.768 --> 01:16:42.297
Please.
Shut up. lady.

1214
01:16:42.433 --> 01:16:44.166
I'm really sorry about this.
all right?

1215
01:16:44.302 --> 01:16:45.600
But he's got my girl.
All right?

1216
01:16:45.736 --> 01:16:47.134
No.

1217
01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.141
Alright. this is happening.

1218
01:16:48.277 --> 01:16:49.142
No.

1219
01:16:49.278 --> 01:16:50.143
Yes.

1220
01:16:50.279 --> 01:16:51.206
No.

1221
01:16:51.342 --> 01:16:52.145
Come on. Vern. this is
happening.

1222
01:16:52.281 --> 01:16:53.149
No.

1223
01:16:53.284 --> 01:16:54.411
This is happening.

1224
01:16:56.652 --> 01:16:58.517
Shit!
God damn it!

1225
01:16:58.653 --> 01:17:01.018
Shit. I can't do it!

1226
01:17:01.153 --> 01:17:02.818
Seriously?
You decide that now?

1227
01:17:02.954 --> 01:17:05.094
I'm going to plan B.

1228
01:17:07.161 --> 01:17:09.329
Shut the fuck up and move.
Fucking move.

1229
01:17:09.465 --> 01:17:10.723
What's plan B?

1230
01:17:10.859 --> 01:17:12.330
We're taking her with us. He can
deal with her himself.

1231
01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:13.527
Who?

1232
01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:15.199
Just shut the fuck up.
It doesn't matter.

1233
01:17:15.334 --> 01:17:16.736
Get the rope from
the back of the truck.

1234
01:17:16.872 --> 01:17:17.799
Just shut up.

1235
01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:19.468
I'm so confused.

1236
01:17:19.603 --> 01:17:21.303
I know. buddy. but you're doing
so good. all right?

1237
01:17:21.438 --> 01:17:23.977
It's almost over.
It's almost over.

1238
01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:36.992
Expecting someone?

1239
01:17:37.128 --> 01:17:39.218
No.

1240
01:17:39.353 --> 01:17:41.423
Well. get rid of them.

1241
01:17:52.038 --> 01:17:55.877
Oh. and no
funny business.

1242
01:18:01.242 --> 01:18:04.248
My dear Tasha.

1243
01:18:04.982 --> 01:18:07.421
There you are.

1244
01:18:07.557 --> 01:18:08.990
How did you find me?

1245
01:18:09.126 --> 01:18:12.927
We're a family. and we always
find our lost sheep.

1246
01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:17.597
And there's nothing stronger

1247
01:18:17.733 --> 01:18:20.737
than the bond of a family.

1248
01:18:24.838 --> 01:18:27.939
Wouldn't you agree?

1249
01:18:28.074 --> 01:18:31.011
What the fuck
is going on?

1250
01:18:37.714 --> 01:18:42.715
Padre. is there something
we can do for you?

1251
01:18:46.495 --> 01:18:49.396
And you are?

1252
01:18:49.531 --> 01:18:51.526
A friend.

1253
01:18:51.661 --> 01:18:56.269
Well. we are a family.
and we're leaving.

1254
01:18:56.405 --> 01:19:00.601
Doesn't look like the little
lady wants to go with you.

1255
01:19:05.245 --> 01:19:09.610
I'm Father Roger.
What's your name?

1256
01:19:13.754 --> 01:19:16.192
Mr. Baxter to you.

1257
01:19:16.327 --> 01:19:18.522
Mr. Baxter.

1258
01:19:18.658 --> 01:19:23.657
We appreciate you being here.
taking care of our Tasha.

1259
01:19:25.459 --> 01:19:27.298
But it's our turn now.

1260
01:19:32.171 --> 01:19:35.607
Do you want
to go with them?

1261
01:19:35.742 --> 01:19:37.539
Go on. tell him.

1262
01:19:40.113 --> 01:19:43.553
I need to go
with them.

1263
01:19:43.688 --> 01:19:47.150
I didn't ask you
if you need to.

1264
01:19:47.285 --> 01:19:48.682
I asked you
if you want to.

1265
01:19:50.923 --> 01:19:52.658
No.
There.

1266
01:19:52.793 --> 01:19:54.857
She made it clear.

1267
01:19:54.992 --> 01:19:57.024
She stays.

1268
01:19:57.159 --> 01:19:58.698
You two can go.

1269
01:19:58.834 --> 01:20:03.405
This doesn't concern you.

1270
01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:06.799
Actually. it does.

1271
01:20:08.309 --> 01:20:12.211
She and I have a little
unfinished business.

1272
01:20:12.346 --> 01:20:15.550
And until that business
gets taken care of.

1273
01:20:15.686 --> 01:20:18.486
she's not going anywhere.

1274
01:20:18.621 --> 01:20:20.850
And neither am I.

1275
01:20:28.663 --> 01:20:31.025
Oh. shit!

1276
01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.001
Not again.

1277
01:20:35.329 --> 01:20:37.874
Oh. my God!

1278
01:20:38.009 --> 01:20:39.739
We have a lady in the back
of the truck.

1279
01:20:39.875 --> 01:20:40.842
We're gonna get arrested!

1280
01:20:40.978 --> 01:20:42.139
I'm gonna need
for you to keep calm

1281
01:20:42.274 --> 01:20:43.306
for me. buddy.
all right?

1282
01:20:43.442 --> 01:20:45.879
Listen. take
deep breaths. okay?

1283
01:20:46.014 --> 01:20:49.582
Just deep breaths.
okay?

1284
01:20:49.718 --> 01:20:50.711
Deep breaths.

1285
01:20:51.884 --> 01:20:52.988
I can't do this.

1286
01:20:53.123 --> 01:20:55.252
You can do it. You can do
this. all right?

1287
01:20:55.387 --> 01:20:57.019
Just I'm gonna need you
to reach down.

1288
01:20:57.155 --> 01:20:59.058
I mean really deep down.

1289
01:20:59.194 --> 01:21:01.925
and find your
inner asshole. okay?

1290
01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:03.096
My inner asshole?

1291
01:21:03.232 --> 01:21:05.397
Yeah. that's right.
Everybody has one.

1292
01:21:05.532 --> 01:21:07.526
Yours just is buried
a little deeper than most.

1293
01:21:07.662 --> 01:21:10.162
but it's there.
trust me.

1294
01:21:10.297 --> 01:21:11.604
Okay.

1295
01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:13.441
That's right.

1296
01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:15.476
Deep breaths.

1297
01:21:15.612 --> 01:21:17.143
Inner asshole.

1298
01:21:17.278 --> 01:21:19.781
You're a fucking
machine. all right?

1299
01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:21.808
A machine.
A fucking machine.

1300
01:21:23.514 --> 01:21:25.149
Evening. officer.

1301
01:21:25.285 --> 01:21:27.217
What seems
to be the problem?

1302
01:21:27.352 --> 01:21:28.381
Your right tail light
is out.

1303
01:21:28.517 --> 01:21:32.125
Oh. no.
I had no idea.

1304
01:21:32.261 --> 01:21:35.393
Thanks for the information.
officer...

1305
01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.395
Dewy?

1306
01:21:39.531 --> 01:21:43.137
What the hell are you
doing here?

1307
01:21:43.272 --> 01:21:45.572
Where the fuck did that
mustache come from?

1308
01:21:45.708 --> 01:21:47.243
Do I know you?

1309
01:21:47.378 --> 01:21:48.773
Yeah.

1310
01:21:48.908 --> 01:21:51.645
Yeah. we've met.

1311
01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:53.977
How are you feeling?

1312
01:21:54.112 --> 01:21:56.447
I'm feeling fine.

1313
01:21:58.655 --> 01:22:01.583
You know what?

1314
01:22:01.718 --> 01:22:03.856
You must know
my twin brother. Ken.

1315
01:22:03.991 --> 01:22:07.926
Yeah. Ken.

1316
01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:10.324
His twin brother. Ken.
Yeah.

1317
01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.433
Ken!
Oh. of course.

1318
01:22:13.569 --> 01:22:15.834
Oh. Ken.

1319
01:22:15.969 --> 01:22:17.197
What's your name?

1320
01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:20.099
Bob. Bob?

1321
01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:22.836
Bob. Hm.

1322
01:22:22.971 --> 01:22:24.737
I've never heard him
mention you before.

1323
01:22:24.872 --> 01:22:27.281
What?
That's strange.

1324
01:22:27.416 --> 01:22:30.482
Well. then again.
it's not that strange. is it?

1325
01:22:30.618 --> 01:22:33.250
You know. it's not like I go
wandering around town

1326
01:22:33.386 --> 01:22:35.523
talking about
Ken. you know?

1327
01:22:35.658 --> 01:22:38.420
Yeah. I suppose.

1328
01:22:38.555 --> 01:22:41.761
So. uh.
how do you know Ken?

1329
01:22:41.897 --> 01:22:44.160
Oh. you know. we're just

1330
01:22:44.295 --> 01:22:47.764
old drinking buddies.

1331
01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:51.172
you know. shooting buddies.
just really buddy buddies.

1332
01:22:53.107 --> 01:22:55.033
Is that so?
Mm-hmm.

1333
01:22:55.169 --> 01:22:56.677
You wouldn't happen to
remember the last time

1334
01:22:56.813 --> 01:22:59.048
you saw him. would you?

1335
01:22:59.183 --> 01:23:04.044
It's been a few days
or. God. a week or two.

1336
01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.481
It's...

1337
01:23:06.616 --> 01:23:09.652
Yeah. it's been
a while. man.

1338
01:23:09.787 --> 01:23:13.619
You wouldn't happen
to know where he's at?

1339
01:23:13.755 --> 01:23:15.363
We're looking
for him.

1340
01:23:15.498 --> 01:23:20.161
You know. because of the
suspension and the allegations.

1341
01:23:20.296 --> 01:23:21.603
Oh. yeah.

1342
01:23:21.739 --> 01:23:24.403
Those dirty allegations.

1343
01:23:25.504 --> 01:23:28.035
Sorry. I don't
know where he is.

1344
01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:32.841
Hm. Well. I'm sure he'll
turn up once he cools down.

1345
01:23:32.976 --> 01:23:35.883
He's probably just out
chasing pussy in Vegas again.

1346
01:23:36.019 --> 01:23:37.678
am I right?

1347
01:23:37.813 --> 01:23:40.951
You know.
old poon hound Ken.

1348
01:23:41.087 --> 01:23:43.118
Oh. that dog.

1349
01:23:43.253 --> 01:23:44.786
Uh-huh. uh-huh.

1350
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:50.856
Well. I won't keep you
anymore of your time.

1351
01:23:50.991 --> 01:23:52.424
Fix that tail light.
will you?

1352
01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.700
Will do. Dewy.

1353
01:24:03.339 --> 01:24:06.306
Holy shit.

1354
01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:07.716
That was close.

1355
01:24:07.851 --> 01:24:10.050
Hey. I can't do this.

1356
01:24:10.185 --> 01:24:11.416
Oh. no.
you did great. buddy.

1357
01:24:11.551 --> 01:24:12.819
You know. he didn't
suspect a thing.

1358
01:24:12.954 --> 01:24:15.150
No. not just that.

1359
01:24:15.285 --> 01:24:16.553
All of this.

1360
01:24:16.689 --> 01:24:18.059
Papa was right.
I'm not cut out for this.

1361
01:24:18.195 --> 01:24:19.954
Hey. hey.
don't think like that.

1362
01:24:20.089 --> 01:24:22.523
You can do whatever
you want to do. all right?

1363
01:24:29.734 --> 01:24:32.702
But. do you even want to
do any of this?

1364
01:24:34.237 --> 01:24:38.111
Well. this wasn't
exactly my childhood dream.

1365
01:24:38.246 --> 01:24:41.280
What do you
want to do?

1366
01:24:41.415 --> 01:24:42.949
Seriously.
do you want to know?

1367
01:24:43.085 --> 01:24:44.978
Yeah.
Yeah. of course.

1368
01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.591
I want to be
a fashion designer.

1369
01:24:52.726 --> 01:24:55.762
You know. bags and clothes.
pretty stuff like that.

1370
01:24:55.897 --> 01:24:58.425
All right.

1371
01:24:58.561 --> 01:25:00.592
I know it's stupid.

1372
01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:02.004
No. no. no. hey. buddy.

1373
01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:03.600
if that's
what your heart wants.

1374
01:25:03.735 --> 01:25:06.433
then that's what
your heart wants. okay?

1375
01:25:06.568 --> 01:25:09.072
Huh. I like that.

1376
01:25:09.207 --> 01:25:10.773
Oh. shit!

1377
01:25:14.284 --> 01:25:15.981
Whoa. whoa. whoa. hey.
No. no. no.

1378
01:25:16.116 --> 01:25:16.981
Get her! Get her!

1379
01:25:17.116 --> 01:25:18.179
I'm trying.

1380
01:25:18.314 --> 01:25:19.850
Stop.

1381
01:25:19.986 --> 01:25:21.448
Help me!

1382
01:25:21.584 --> 01:25:23.917
Somebody please help me!

1383
01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:25.493
We're not gonna hurt you.
all right?

1384
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:28.019
We're not gonna hurt you.
All right. we're not gonna --

1385
01:25:28.155 --> 01:25:29.727
We personally
are not gonna hurt you.

1386
01:25:29.863 --> 01:25:33.195
but there's this other guy.
Cole T. Baxter. okay?

1387
01:25:33.331 --> 01:25:34.833
Wait. Baxter?

1388
01:25:34.968 --> 01:25:35.836
Yeah.

1389
01:25:35.971 --> 01:25:36.967
This is about him?

1390
01:25:37.102 --> 01:25:38.373
Yeah.

1391
01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:42.836
We explained this to him
and his lawyers a million times!

1392
01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.511
It was an accident!
Shh. shh. shh!

1393
01:25:44.647 --> 01:25:46.348
I didn't kill his wife!
I believe you. I believe you.

1394
01:25:46.483 --> 01:25:48.478
I totally believe you.
and if we just get in the car

1395
01:25:48.614 --> 01:25:49.912
and go explain
it all to him.

1396
01:25:50.047 --> 01:25:53.846
then we can go about
just living our lives again.

1397
01:25:53.981 --> 01:25:55.882
Okay? All right.
Come on. lady.

1398
01:25:56.018 --> 01:25:58.020
Let's just
get back in the truck.

1399
01:25:58.156 --> 01:25:59.526
Come on.

1400
01:25:59.661 --> 01:26:02.862
Come on. lady. Just back in
the truck. Please?

1401
01:26:02.997 --> 01:26:04.332
Fuck you!

1402
01:26:08.169 --> 01:26:09.704
- Is she okay?

1403
01:26:09.839 --> 01:26:11.834
Doctor lady?

1404
01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.786
I think she's dead.

1405
01:26:30.522 --> 01:26:32.694
Oh. shit.
Oh. shit.

1406
01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:39.092
I fucking hate
dead bodies.

1407
01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.932
What are you doing?

1408
01:26:46.068 --> 01:26:49.111
I don't care if you
are a preacher.

1409
01:26:49.247 --> 01:26:51.912
You can get the hell
out of here.

1410
01:26:52.047 --> 01:26:54.041
Why don't we pray?

1411
01:26:54.176 --> 01:26:56.917
I'm not really much
of a religious man.

1412
01:26:57.052 --> 01:26:58.881
I can change that.

1413
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:02.258
A gun? Really?

1414
01:27:02.393 --> 01:27:04.851
Wait. you shoot him.
and we are all dead.

1415
01:27:04.986 --> 01:27:07.356
She's right.
You see this?

1416
01:27:07.491 --> 01:27:10.630
I let go of this.

1417
01:27:10.765 --> 01:27:13.769
and you'll be preaching in
a warmer place. padre.

1418
01:27:13.904 --> 01:27:16.303
Huh. interesting.

1419
01:27:16.439 --> 01:27:19.704
What can I say?
I'm an interesting man.

1420
01:27:25.243 --> 01:27:27.112
So?

1421
01:27:27.248 --> 01:27:28.912
What's it gonna be?

1422
01:27:29.048 --> 01:27:33.983
I think I'll just leave it up
to the higher power.

1423
01:27:36.953 --> 01:27:38.657
Shh. shh. shh. shh. shh.

1424
01:27:38.792 --> 01:27:42.661
The Lord giveth.
and the Lord taketh away.

1425
01:27:47.398 --> 01:27:49.701
I'm sorry.

1426
01:28:10.291 --> 01:28:12.361
Okay. okay.

1427
01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:19.127
Whose red truck is that?

1428
01:28:19.262 --> 01:28:23.300
- I don't know. but it's
nicer than yours.

1429
01:28:23.436 --> 01:28:25.704
Shut the fuck up. Pedro.

Why did you do that?!

1432
01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:53.194
He did nothing to you!

1433
01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:57.906
Like I said. the Lord gives
and the Lord takes.

1434

Yes.

Babe. what's going on?

1437
01:29:06.146 --> 01:29:07.541
Pookie!

1438
01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:09.011
Who's this?

1439
01:29:09.147 --> 01:29:11.887
We're her family.
and we're taking her home.

1440
01:29:12.022 --> 01:29:13.713

1441
01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:15.752
You son of a bitch!

1442
01:29:15.888 --> 01:29:17.886
Drop it. or I'll blow
your head off!

1443
01:29:18.021 --> 01:29:19.861
Oh. yeah?
I'll blow his head off!

1444
01:29:19.997 --> 01:29:22.188
Easy. sister.

1445
01:29:22.324 --> 01:29:25.333
He who is slow to anger
quiets contention.

1446
01:29:25.469 --> 01:29:26.826
Jesus Christ.
just shoot him already.

1447
01:29:26.962 --> 01:29:29.499
No!
Nobody move!

1448
01:29:29.634 --> 01:29:30.499
Who the hell are you?

1449
01:29:30.635 --> 01:29:32.104
DEA! Drop the guns!

1450
01:29:32.239 --> 01:29:33.237
I can't do that.

1451
01:29:33.372 --> 01:29:35.402
Drop them. Now!

1452

You don't understand. man.
There's a situation going on.

1453

He's the one you want.

1454
01:29:39.613 --> 01:29:41.646
The only one
I want is Bob.

1455

Huh? Treadway.
get out here! It's over.

1456

You're looking for Bob?

Yes. Where is he? Huh?

Bob's dead.

1459
01:29:50.554 --> 01:29:52.158
No. no. no. no.

1460
01:29:52.294 --> 01:29:53.555
You're fucking with me.

1461

But not this time. okay?

1462
01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:56.255
Not this time.

1463
01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:58.092
Okay. I'm not leaving here
without him!

1464
01:29:58.227 --> 01:30:00.425
This is your only chance.
Come out!

1465
01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:03.296
I'm telling you he's dead.
I shot him myself.

1466
01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:06.607
You shot Bob?

1467
01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:10.011
You're not Bob?

1468
01:30:10.147 --> 01:30:11.412
Hey. listen. buddy.

1469
01:30:11.548 --> 01:30:13.611
It's still me.
it's still the same guy.

1470
01:30:13.746 --> 01:30:15.140
just a different
name. okay?

1471
01:30:15.276 --> 01:30:17.313
What name?
What is your name?

1472
01:30:17.448 --> 01:30:18.616
Vern.

1473
01:30:18.751 --> 01:30:20.586
I can't believe
you lied to me.

1474
01:30:20.721 --> 01:30:22.290
It's for your own
good. buddy.

1475
01:30:22.425 --> 01:30:24.953
How? How is this
for my own good?

1476
01:30:25.089 --> 01:30:26.291
What else have you lied
to me about?

1477
01:30:26.426 --> 01:30:28.692
Nothing. I swear.

1478
01:30:28.828 --> 01:30:32.264
Just shut
the fuck up! Okay?

1479
01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.970
Now. is Bob really dead?

1480
01:30:35.105 --> 01:30:35.960
Yes!
Yes.

1481
01:30:36.096 --> 01:30:38.672
Yes. he's fucking dead.

1482
01:30:39.638 --> 01:30:41.739
What about Martha? Hm?

1483
01:30:41.874 --> 01:30:44.070
She's dead. too.
They're both dead.

Martha. too?!

Okay. listen.

1493

I buried them
in the backyard.

1494
01:31:09.401 --> 01:31:11.996
I'll take you back there.
I'll show you the graves myself.

finally gone.
