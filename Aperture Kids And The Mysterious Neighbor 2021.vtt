Do you hear it?

8
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:51.509
It's the clock.

9
00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.179
It mocks me.

10
00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.849
(thunder rumbling)

11
00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.517
Because it knows my secret.

12
00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:01.519
(thunder booming)

13
00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.189

(clanking)

17
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.378
Shh. he's here.

18
00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:30.715
- [Man] Maybe you
should just stop.

19
00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:31.883
Just don't do it.

20
00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:33.551
- [Man] I can't.

21
00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:34.385
- [Man] Why?

22
00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.639
- [Man] Because
I've gone too far.

23
00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.390

24
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.935

39
00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.630
- [Jessica] And the little
fairy returned home.

40
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.298
never to fear again.

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:30.561

Jess. get this blasted
thing off me. would ya?

50
00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:42.573
- Hold on a sec!

51
00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:43.741
I got an idea!

52
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:44.575
- Jessica. where are you going?

53
00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:46.828
I. I can't breathe!

54
00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.330
(Alex grunts)

55
00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:54.335
(mischievous music)

56
00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.088
Jessica. what are you doing?

57
00:04:57.088 --> 00:04:59.924
(suspicious music)

58
00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:02.593

61
00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:06.931
- See. it worked.

62
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:07.807
- What worked?

63
00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.100
- My idea.

64
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.768
- Your idea of what.
pain and suffering?

65
00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:11.602
- No. of getting you free.

66
00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:12.770
See. you're free.

67
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.106
- You know. I don't
think I like your ideas.

68
00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:16.274
(glass shattering)

69
00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:19.152
(heavy thudding)

70
00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.778
- Nice knowing you.

71
00:05:22.363 --> 00:05:23.197
(crashing)

72
00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:25.616
(scary music)

73
00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:49.640
(train whistle wailing)

74
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.574
(Jessica screams)

75
00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:02.755
(thunder rumbling)

76
00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:06.092
Where are you going?!

77
00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.761
(shadowy music)

78
00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:22.900
- Who do you think they were?

79
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.901
- Bad guys.

80
00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:30.741
(cellphone ringing)
(dog barking)

81
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:33.244
(misty music)

82
00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:38.624
- [Mom] Hey guys. it's--

83
00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:39.792
(static buzzing)

84
00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.794
I think I have a bad connection.

85
00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:43.254
I'm running a little late.

86
00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:45.423
Alex. heat up the
leftovers from last night

87
00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.258
and don't forget
to feed the dog.

88
00:07:48.676 --> 00:07:50.928
Oh. and tell your sister
not to overfill the bathtub!

89
00:07:50.928 --> 00:07:52.763
(banging on the wall)
- Jessica!

90
00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:54.807
Don't overfill the bathtub!

91
00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.142
- [Jessica] Please don't eat me!

92
00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.269
(water splashing)

93
00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.854
(water sucking)

94
00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:02.440
(shaded music)

95
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.887
(electronic beeping)

96
00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:38.059
- Thanks. mom.

97
00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.186
This'll sorta make up
for the lame birthday.

98
00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.898
(phone beeping)

99
00:08:43.898 --> 00:08:46.859
(water dripping)

100
00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:49.987
(door creaking)

101
00:08:49.987 --> 00:08:52.657
(pleasant music)

102
00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:01.916
(bell dings)

103
00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:06.003
(phone ringing)
(dog barking)

104
00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:08.839
Hey. yeah. um. I'd
like to order a pizza.

105
00:09:08.839 --> 00:09:11.509
(bemused music)

106
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.013
(bell dings)

107
00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:17.848
(knocking on the door)
Hey little ewok.

108
00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:18.683
dinner's ready.

109
00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:23.521
(squishing)

110
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:26.107
(Alex sighs)

111
00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.608
(banging on the door)
Let me in!

112
00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:29.402
- [Jessica] Excuse me?

113
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.946
- The carpet. Jessica. it's
like a swamp down there!

114
00:09:31.946 --> 00:09:33.864
- [Jessica] I'm
sorry. but I'm a lady.

115
00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:35.908
and I'm inappropriately
dressed at the moment.

116
00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:37.368
You'll have to come back later.

117
00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:38.202
- Ugh!

118
00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:43.124
(cellphone ringing)

119
00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:44.542
(beeps)

120
00:09:44.542 --> 00:09:47.044
- [John] Alex. uh.
it's. it's dad again.

121
00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:51.382
Did you know that conviction
is an uncommon thing?

122
00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:53.551
Only when you lay your
head down at night

123
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.053
do you feel its gnawing teeth.

124
00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.765
Maybe that's why I
can't sleep at night.

125
00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:03.561
And my writings only
bring conviction.

126
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:06.105
(creepy music)

127
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:11.068
(gate creaking)

128
00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:22.079
(knocking on the door)

129
00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:23.914
- [Jessica] Who is it?

130
00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:27.918
Who is it?

131
00:10:30.254 --> 00:10:31.672
- [Mom] The pizza guy.

132
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.258
- The pizza guy?

133
00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:37.428
You don't sound
like the pizza guy.

134
00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.680
- [Mom] Open the door.

135
00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:45.102
- Cool!

136
00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:45.936
Pizza!

137
00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:50.107
(suspicious music)

138
00:10:57.948 --> 00:10:58.783
- [Man] Delivered.

139
00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:02.453
(mysterious music)

140
00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:05.665
(knocking on the door)

141
00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:09.168
- Some nice man
left this for you.

142
00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.837
- Um. thanks.

143
00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:14.465
(puzzled music)

144
00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:22.473
(moves into serious music)

145
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.978
- [Mom] Why don't you
try knocking next time?

146
00:11:27.978 --> 00:11:29.647
- Total extraction.

147
00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:30.731
- Alex. English.

148
00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:32.024
I am tired.

149
00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:34.068
- I was totally ripped
out of a place I knew.

150
00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:36.237
- You know why. come on.

151
00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:37.321
- What. dad?

152
00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:40.366
- Your father left us.

153
00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:42.326
I was running out of options.

154
00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:43.661
- He left us?

155
00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.163
Then why is he still
there and we're here?

156
00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:47.039
- What?

157
00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:47.832
- He didn't have to pack.

158
00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:48.833
He didn't have to move.

159
00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:49.834
We moved.

160
00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:51.335
So how did he leave us?

161
00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:55.089
- He completely abandoned his
role as husband and father.

162
00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:56.841
I consider that leaving.

163
00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.175
- Over something he loves?

164
00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:00.010
- No. over something he hated.

165
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.887
like being a responsible father!

166
00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:03.931
- There's nothing really
wrong with what he did.

167
00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:05.725
- Do you wanna go
to college one day?

168
00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.518
It requires money.

169
00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:08.936
- He said he's gonna
pay it all back.

170
00:12:08.936 --> 00:12:10.604
- Oh. really?

171
00:12:10.604 --> 00:12:13.858
Well I'm extremely impressed
with your vast knowledge

172
00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.360
of personal financing.

173
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.696
Alex. you're 17.

174
00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:20.531
- I know what
comes after 17 too.

175
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:22.116
- Oh good. I'm
glad you can count.

176
00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:23.784
- And when I'm 18...

177
00:12:23.784 --> 00:12:26.203
- I'm sure the Army
would love to have you.

178
00:12:26.203 --> 00:12:27.621
- I'm thinking there's
a better option.

179
00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:29.206
and he lives across town.

180
00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:32.084
- Why can't you be more like
me and less like your father?

181
00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:34.044
- Oh. (laughs) I'm
sorry. I forgot.

182
00:12:34.044 --> 00:12:35.379
You're perfect. aren't you?

183
00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:36.756
- Alex. that's not what I mean.

184
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:37.715
- Almost perfect then.

185
00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:38.549
- No!

186
00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:39.717
- You know what?

187
00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:40.760
God's holy couldn't live up

188
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.052
to your self-righteous
standards!

189
00:12:42.052 --> 00:12:43.637
- How dare you!

190
00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:45.389
- Let me share a
little story with you.

191
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:47.224
Dad still loves you.

192
00:12:47.224 --> 00:12:48.392
He didn't want us to leave

193
00:12:48.392 --> 00:12:50.102
and he's sorry for what he did.

194
00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:51.395
- Alex. stop.

195
00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:52.813
- This Sunday you'll be
wanting to go to church.

196
00:12:52.813 --> 00:12:54.231
You'll be hounding
me to come along.

197
00:12:54.231 --> 00:12:58.152
Well you can tell the
congregation he's gone fishing!

198
00:12:58.152 --> 00:12:59.069
(door slams)

199
00:12:59.069 --> 00:13:01.781
(dramatic music)

200
00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.333
(mom crying)

201
00:13:14.293 --> 00:13:16.921
(door creaking)

202
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:34.188
(water splashing)

203
00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:37.024
(drain sucking)

204
00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:39.443
(door creaking)

205
00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:42.196
(questing music)

206
00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:54.625
(Jessica clears her throat)

207
00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:01.799
- No!

208
00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:06.387
- Okay. that's for making
mom cry last night.

209
00:14:06.387 --> 00:14:08.013
- I'm gonna make you
cry in two seconds!

210
00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:09.473
Stop it!

211
00:14:09.473 --> 00:14:12.142
- Mommy's at work.
but she left this.

212
00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:18.566
"Jessica. clean that den of
squalor you call a room."

213
00:14:19.483 --> 00:14:20.818
I'm not sure what squalor means.

214
00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:21.986
Do you know what that means?

215
00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:22.820
- Just go on.

216
00:14:23.737 --> 00:14:25.656
- "Alex. the last time I checked

217
00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:28.325
"you still are
unemployed and need gas

218
00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:30.661
"to operate your
motorized vehicle.

219
00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:34.164
"Therefore. I strongly
suggest you mow the lawn."

220
00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:37.167
Wow. mom sure has a way
with words. don't she?

221
00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.335
- Just stop it!

222
00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:41.422
(uninterested music)

223
00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:45.175
(door creaking)

224
00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:51.181
(clattering)

225
00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:53.934
(motor rumbling)

226
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:59.523
(eerie music)

227
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.865
(banging)

228
00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:10.075
- [Man] Hey kid. hold
that fence plank still!

229
00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:12.536
(banging)

230
00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:13.704
That should do!

231
00:15:13.704 --> 00:15:14.538
Let go!

232
00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:16.957
(banging)
(keys jingling)

233
00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:19.543
(creepy music)

234
00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:24.715
- Are you okay?

235
00:15:24.715 --> 00:15:25.549
I saw what.

236
00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:29.219
accidentally saw what
happened yesterday.

237
00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:32.097
(mysterious music)

238
00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:42.733
(keys clattering)

239
00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.485
- Huh. guess I need
to work on that.

240
00:15:44.485 --> 00:15:45.945
Tell your sister to wash up.

241
00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:52.910
The yard looks pretty good.

242
00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:55.913
- Wish I could say
the same about dinner.

243
00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:01.001
- Okay. I'll tell her.

244
00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:02.920
- Tell me what. sweetie?

245
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.089
- Something's
going on next door.

246
00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:06.298
See. I said it.

247
00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:08.342
- What kind of stuff?

248
00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:09.802
- Scary stuff!

249
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.471
- What she's trying to say
is I spoke with dad yesterday

250
00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:14.181
and he doesn't like
the neighborhood.

251
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:16.100
I'm gonna have to agree
with him on that one.

252
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.935
- Okay. so now you have
your father involved?

253
00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.603
- He's just concerned.

254
00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:20.854
He really misses us

255
00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:22.856
and he's been voice
messaging me lately

256
00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:26.777
and some of the messages
have been kind of. you know.

257
00:16:26.777 --> 00:16:27.611
- What?

258
00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:31.115
- Odd. bizarre.
strange. you pick.

259
00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:32.533
- Well it is your father
you're talking about.

260
00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:33.867
That doesn't surprise me.

261
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:36.829
- He did a safety check
on the neighborhood.

262
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.622
- What did that show?

263
00:16:38.622 --> 00:16:39.790
- A lot of red dots.

264
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.041
- Yeah. mommy.

265
00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:41.959
and I think the guy next door

266
00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:44.003
is involved with criminal stuff.

267
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:44.837
Right. Alex?

268
00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.338
- Uh. maybe.

269
00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:48.173
Dad said one of those red
dots showed up next door

270
00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.676
and he wants us out
of here and back home.

271
00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:51.969
- All right. that's it.

272
00:16:51.969 --> 00:16:54.179
You stay out of his yard
and out of his sight.

273
00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.014
You got it?

274
00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:00.310
I was talking to
a friend at work

275
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.980
and she invited us to church.

276
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.981
- Oh joy.

277
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:05.482
- Oh no. it gets better.

278
00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:07.234
She needs someone to help
out with her yard work.

279
00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:09.236
- Isn't Jessica a
little young for that?

280
00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:11.155
- She is. but you're not.

281
00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.656
(Jessica laughs)
- Oh come on!

282
00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:14.074
- You need the money.

283
00:17:14.074 --> 00:17:15.993
- Can't I just work at
the mall or something?

284
00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:18.203
People who go to church
make me feel uncomfortable.

285
00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:19.872
They're always so
self-righteous.

286
00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.499
- You think they're gonna
judge you on how you cut grass?

287
00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:24.001
- No. there's other stuff.

288
00:17:24.001 --> 00:17:24.835
- Oh really?

289
00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:26.045
Are you confessing?

290
00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:27.671
- No. I'm leaving.

291
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:29.173
- But you can't!

292
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:30.174
- And why can't I?

293
00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.925
- Because it's your night.

294
00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:33.010
- My night for what?

295
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.511
- To do the dishes.

296
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:35.929
- Well tell the boss
I'm taking a sick day.

297
00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:38.682
(dramatic music)

298
00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.283
(typing)

299
00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:10.547
(questioning music)

300
00:18:17.554 --> 00:18:20.099
- I have potato soup
inside if you're hungry!

301
00:18:20.099 --> 00:18:22.226
- No. I. I was looking
for something I lost.

302
00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.435
I live right here.

303
00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:24.728
- It must be pretty important

304
00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:26.105
that you'd dumpster dive for it.

305
00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.899
- Just something I accidentally
threw away. no big deal.

306
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.902
- Well I'm glad you found it.

307
00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:34.071
My name is Willy Harper.

308
00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:35.405
I'm your nextdoor neighbor.

309
00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:38.575
- I'm Alex.

310
00:18:38.575 --> 00:18:40.244
- Well Alex. I guess
we're neighbors.

311
00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:42.412
- I best be getting inside.

312
00:18:42.412 --> 00:18:44.665
The warden doesn't like
inmates out after dark.

313
00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:46.917
- So your parents keep
you on a short leash?

314
00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:49.253
- Just my mom.

315
00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:51.255
My parents are
separated at the moment.

316
00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:54.133
My dad has all the money and
my mom has all the rules.

317
00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.425
- I'm sorry to hear that.

318
00:18:55.425 --> 00:18:57.427
but you still only
have one family.

319
00:18:57.427 --> 00:19:00.806
- Do parents living in separate
houses count as one or two?

320
00:19:00.806 --> 00:19:02.099
- It still counts as one.

321
00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:05.102
- I best be getting inside.

322
00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.145
- Well good night. neighbor.

323
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.146
- Yeah. seeya.

324
00:19:08.438 --> 00:19:10.274
- [Jessica] Look. mommy.

325
00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.609
- [Mom] Wow. you're good!

326
00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:14.111
What's up. Doc?

327
00:19:14.111 --> 00:19:14.945
- [Jessica] What?

328
00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:15.946
- [Mom] Oh. never mind.

329
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:18.115
- [Jessica] Roar!

330
00:19:18.115 --> 00:19:19.658
- [Mom] Ah. you got me!

331
00:19:19.658 --> 00:19:21.869
(Jessica laughs)

332
00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:24.204
- Mommy. do you
still love daddy?

333
00:19:24.204 --> 00:19:26.123
- What makes you say that?

334
00:19:26.123 --> 00:19:27.166
- Just because.

335
00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.960
- Well. between me and you

336
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.629
and Mister Bear here.

337
00:19:32.629 --> 00:19:33.881
I do.

338
00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:37.301
I can honestly say I do.

339
00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:39.553
We just have things to
work out. that's all.

340
00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:44.141
Now you need to get some sleep.

341
00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:45.058
(kissing)

342
00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:46.810
- I just wondered something.

343
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.312
- What's that?

344
00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.022
- Do you think daddy misses us?

345
00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.316
- Oh I know he misses you.

346
00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:53.817
- What about you and Alex?

347
00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:56.820
- I'm sure he misses
Alex very much.

348
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.030
- But not you?

349
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.490
Is that why you live
in different houses?

350
00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.825
- Well when you get big--

351
00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:03.160
- Like five feet tall?

352
00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.204
- Like five feet tall.

353
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:08.165
things get really complicated.

354
00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:10.751
- Kind of like trying to
explain things about God.

355
00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:11.835
stuff like that?

356
00:20:11.835 --> 00:20:13.170
- Exactly.

357
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.379
- You know what?

358
00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:15.881
- What?

359
00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:18.175
- I don't think Alex really
cares anything about God.

360
00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:20.719
(somber music)

361
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:28.268
(mom sniffling)

362
00:20:28.268 --> 00:20:30.938
(ominous music)

363
00:20:50.374 --> 00:20:51.708
(engine rumbling)

364
00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:53.210
- [Radio DJ] Hey out
there. radio land.

365
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.461
you're listening to the
best station in the city.

366
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:57.381
where we'll be playing
all your favorites.

367
00:20:57.381 --> 00:20:59.549

530
00:28:27.914 --> 00:28:29.165
- Are you kidding me?

531
00:28:29.165 --> 00:28:31.668
I'm here for a week with
a man four times my age.

532
00:28:31.668 --> 00:28:34.921
I'm pretty sure I can
handle a change in pace.

533
00:28:34.921 --> 00:28:37.424
- All right. well uh.
how do I put this?

534
00:28:37.424 --> 00:28:40.927
The guy next door.
uh. ck his wife.

535
00:28:40.927 --> 00:28:41.928
- No way.

536
00:28:41.928 --> 00:28:42.762

538
00:28:44.848 --> 00:28:46.266
- [Alex] Got it all on my phone.

539
00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:48.601
- So you're saying
you recorded it.

540
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:49.853
Did you send it to the police?

541
00:28:49.853 --> 00:28:52.605
- Uh. I didn't really
get him doing the deed.

542
00:28:52.605 --> 00:28:55.525
but I got him in a gnarly
fight with some detectives.

543
00:28:55.525 --> 00:28:57.527
- Mm. yeah. sounds kinda lame.

544
00:28:59.028 --> 00:29:00.572
- I think it happened
a while back.

545
00:29:00.572 --> 00:29:02.365
maybe a couple months ago.

546
00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:03.867
Police didn't find anything.

547
00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:05.034
but some detectives
still believe

548
00:29:05.034 --> 00:29:06.369
that she's still in the house.

549
00:29:06.369 --> 00:29:09.038
(weighty music)

550
00:29:10.707 --> 00:29:12.041
What's wrong?

551
00:29:12.041 --> 00:29:15.211
- Doesn't this stuff
kinda freak you out?

552
00:29:16.379 --> 00:29:19.716
Like. there could be
a dead body next door.

553
00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:20.717
- Not really.

554
00:29:20.717 --> 00:29:22.218
I mean. if you think about it.

555
00:29:22.218 --> 00:29:25.054
there's dead bodies at the
cemetery down the street.

556
00:29:25.054 --> 00:29:27.557
Guess I just don't think
about death that much.

557
00:29:27.557 --> 00:29:29.476
- I used to think like that.

558
00:29:29.476 --> 00:29:31.269
Then I saw something.

559
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.396
Something that changed me.

560
00:29:33.396 --> 00:29:34.230
- What was it?

561
00:29:35.565 --> 00:29:37.484
Hello. Christina. what was it?

562
00:29:37.484 --> 00:29:38.777
- What?
- What'd you see?

563
00:29:41.571 --> 00:29:42.989
- Right here.

564
00:29:42.989 --> 00:29:44.908
It's crazy how
something so small

565
00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:46.951
can make such a big
impact on your life.

566
00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:47.786
- [Alex] I don't get it.

567
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.162
What's in the envelope?

568
00:29:50.497 --> 00:29:54.167
- Alex. do you believe in God?

569
00:29:54.167 --> 00:29:55.418
- I don't know.

570
00:29:55.418 --> 00:29:56.836
I don't really think
about stuff like that.

571
00:29:56.836 --> 00:29:58.755
I'm not that
spiritual. you know.

572
00:29:58.755 --> 00:30:01.424
- Spiritual. is that
what you're calling it?

573
00:30:01.424 --> 00:30:03.593
I thought we were just talking.

574
00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.845
- If you are. you'd get
along great with my mom.

575
00:30:05.845 --> 00:30:08.264
- No. I mean. have you
ever thought about like

576
00:30:08.264 --> 00:30:10.350
what happens after you die?

577
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.935
- Yeah. you're buried.

578
00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:13.603
- After you're buried.

579
00:30:13.603 --> 00:30:15.939
- Okay. well there's a
lot of sad music playing.

580
00:30:15.939 --> 00:30:17.273
- [Christina] No. Alex.

581
00:30:17.273 --> 00:30:19.943
- Okay. I don't get
what you're getting at.

582
00:30:19.943 --> 00:30:22.946
- You have a soul that
lives on forever somewhere.

583
00:30:22.946 --> 00:30:23.947
- You are spiritual.

584
00:30:23.947 --> 00:30:25.615
and you're preaching at me.

585
00:30:25.615 --> 00:30:27.283
- [Willy] Christina.
we gotta go!

586
00:30:27.283 --> 00:30:28.451
- Gotta run.

587
00:30:28.451 --> 00:30:30.787
My granddaddy's
taking me to the mall.

588
00:30:30.787 --> 00:30:32.288
And I might be spiritual.

589
00:30:32.288 --> 00:30:34.123
but this girl's got
a carnal side too.

590
00:30:35.458 --> 00:30:36.292
Shopping!

591
00:30:36.292 --> 00:30:39.128
(mystified music)

592
00:30:43.007 --> 00:30:46.010
(clattering)

593
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.512
- [Alex] Come on. Jess!

594
00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.806
You're taking so long I
just had another birthday!

595
00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:50.974
- I'm coming already!

596
00:30:50.974 --> 00:30:53.476
You need to work
on your patience!

597
00:30:53.476 --> 00:30:54.352
Mm.

598
00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:55.186
Ah.

599
00:30:56.312 --> 00:30:57.480
There you are.

600
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.314
Got it!

601
00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:04.696
(questing percussion music)

602
00:31:05.989 --> 00:31:07.532
- Okay. now I need you
to pay close attention

603
00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:08.908
or somebody's gonna get hurt.

604
00:31:08.908 --> 00:31:11.077
Probably me. but
I'm okay with that.

605
00:31:11.077 --> 00:31:12.078
You're young.

606
00:31:12.078 --> 00:31:13.037
- Affirmative!

607
00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:14.581
- Now I know we've been advised

608
00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:15.999
to stay off the
neighbor's property.

609
00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:18.001
but I deducted a more
aggressive approach is necessary

610
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:19.586
to crack this case.

611
00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:20.837
- What?

612
00:31:20.837 --> 00:31:21.671
- Hand me the dog.

613
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:22.672
We're going in.

614
00:31:22.672 --> 00:31:25.174
(ritualistic percussion music)

615
00:31:25.174 --> 00:31:26.217
Are you serious?

616
00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:27.719
- But he's my favorite!

617
00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:28.928
- Look. I've met
the neighbor's dog.

618
00:31:28.928 --> 00:31:30.346
He looks nothing like this.

619
00:31:30.346 --> 00:31:32.181
We need something
with more attitude.

620
00:31:32.181 --> 00:31:33.182
something like that.

621
00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:35.351
Rah!

622
00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:36.227
See. that's more like
the neighbor's dog.

623
00:31:36.227 --> 00:31:37.353
- But Alex!

624
00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:38.563
- Shh!

625
00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.064
So I'm thinking our
biggest challenge

626
00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:42.108
is gonna be the bite-osaurus
in the backyard.

627
00:31:42.108 --> 00:31:45.069
so for the moment that means
a backyard assault is out.

628
00:31:45.069 --> 00:31:46.863
I'm thinking a frontal
assault is the ticket.

629
00:31:46.863 --> 00:31:48.948
We'll lay low and
we'll be stealthy.

630
00:31:48.948 --> 00:31:50.199
- But I got--

631
00:31:50.199 --> 00:31:50.950
- Please hold your
questions til the end.

632
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.243
Sheesh.

633
00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:53.703
Okay.

634
00:31:53.703 --> 00:31:55.204
Mom gets off work at 11:00.

635
00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:57.540
which means she'll
be home around 11:20.

636
00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.042
give or take a minute or two.

637
00:31:59.042 --> 00:32:00.710
That means that our
plan has to be executed

638
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.378
no later than 10:00 p.m. sharp.

639
00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:04.297
We'll use the cover
of night as our ally.

640
00:32:04.297 --> 00:32:07.550
The little raging monster
will never know we're there.

641
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.427
Will you. you little
beastie? (laughs)

642
00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:10.887
Woof!

643
00:32:10.887 --> 00:32:12.639
All right. any questions?

644
00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:16.100
- I think you mean meow.
because this is a cat.

645
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.561
See his little
whiskers right there?

646
00:32:18.561 --> 00:32:20.063
Look at his pointy ears.

647
00:32:20.063 --> 00:32:22.065
Look at his fluffy little paws!

648
00:32:22.065 --> 00:32:24.734
(serious music)

649
00:32:28.988 --> 00:32:30.239
Stop bumping so much!

650
00:32:30.239 --> 00:32:31.574
You sound like
you're stuttering.

651
00:32:31.574 --> 00:32:33.743
- Sorry. the connection's...

652
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.454
- Alex?

653
00:32:38.247 --> 00:32:39.082
Alex!

654
00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:42.794
- Just hit your bike.

655
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.296
Hold on. is that better?

656
00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.589
- Yeah. what did you do?

657
00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:47.590
- Stopped moving.

658
00:32:50.593 --> 00:32:51.803
- Alex?

659
00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:52.637
- Shh!

660
00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:53.846
Hold on!

661
00:32:53.846 --> 00:32:55.181
I don't know if
this is good or bad.

662
00:32:55.181 --> 00:32:56.599
- What do you mean?

663
00:32:56.599 --> 00:32:57.433
- There's no lights on.

664
00:32:57.433 --> 00:32:58.601
He might not be home.

665
00:32:58.601 --> 00:33:00.687
I'm gonna go closer.

666
00:33:00.687 --> 00:33:03.690
(suspenseful music)

667
00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:07.944
- Don't get risky.

668
00:33:07.944 --> 00:33:09.278
- Too late.

669
00:33:09.278 --> 00:33:10.279
- Why do you say that?

670
00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:11.447
- I'm in his front lawn.

671
00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:15.660
- What's back there?

672
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.828
Looks like a light.

673
00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:19.789
(frightened music)

674
00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:23.793
Alex!

675
00:33:23.793 --> 00:33:26.129
(scary music)

676
00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:34.804
Alex?

677
00:33:34.804 --> 00:33:35.638
Alex!

678
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.474
- [Alex] Sorry. my hand slipped.

679
00:33:40.643 --> 00:33:42.562
- Maybe you should
come back now.

680
00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:43.813
- Hold on.

681
00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:46.190
I think there's a
basement light on.

682
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.316
I'm gonna go take a closer look.

683
00:33:47.316 --> 00:33:50.028
(intrepid music)

684
00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:54.741
(beeping)

685
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:56.242
- Why don't you work already!

686
00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:58.828
(creepy music)

687
00:34:07.253 --> 00:34:08.421
- Hey. what's that?

688
00:34:08.421 --> 00:34:11.174
(dramatic music)

689
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:23.019
(keys jingling)

690
00:34:24.187 --> 00:34:25.563
- Alex. hide. you've gotta hide.

691
00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:26.731
The man's home!

692
00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:29.400
(panicky music)

693
00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:32.528
Alex. please hide!

694
00:34:33.696 --> 00:34:34.530
Alex!

695
00:34:35.615 --> 00:34:37.283
(keys jingling)

696
00:34:37.283 --> 00:34:40.036
(dramatic music)

697
00:34:47.043 --> 00:34:48.711
- [Man] I know you're there!

698
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:50.046
I can smell your sneakers.

699
00:34:50.046 --> 00:34:52.548
(tense music)

700
00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:00.723
(dog barking)

701
00:35:00.723 --> 00:35:01.557
- Gotta call 911!

702
00:35:01.557 --> 00:35:02.892
Gotta call 911!

703
00:35:02.892 --> 00:35:05.895
(frantic music)

704
00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:06.729
(knocking on the door)

705
00:35:06.729 --> 00:35:07.647
Who is it?

706
00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:10.733
(apprehensive music)

707
00:35:12.568 --> 00:35:14.737
(knocking on the door)

708
00:35:14.737 --> 00:35:15.947
Who is it?

709
00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.574
- [Alex] It's me.
Jess. just let me in.

710
00:35:18.574 --> 00:35:21.077
- You about scared
the poo out of me!

711
00:35:21.077 --> 00:35:22.286
Did the man see you?

712
00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:23.746
- I don't know. but
that dog sure did.

713
00:35:23.746 --> 00:35:26.666
He got a good nip
of my shoulder too.

714
00:35:26.666 --> 00:35:28.167
- You need to call 911!

715
00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:29.085
- No. I'm fine.

716
00:35:29.085 --> 00:35:31.087
- We need to call the police!

717
00:35:31.087 --> 00:35:32.505
- And tell them what. Jess?

718
00:35:32.505 --> 00:35:34.090
That I was sneaking
around my neighbor's yard

719
00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.925
taking pictures?

720
00:35:35.925 --> 00:35:37.135
No. thank you.

721
00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:38.594
- Are you okay?

722
00:35:38.594 --> 00:35:39.470
- I'm fine.

723
00:35:41.264 --> 00:35:42.640
You know that dog next door?

724
00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.850
- Yeah.

725
00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:45.977
- He's nothing like
your Littlest Pet Shops.

726
00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:47.103
(phone rings)

727
00:35:47.103 --> 00:35:48.187
- It's mommy!

728

Hello mommy. are you okay?

729
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:54.694
(dial tone beeping)

730
00:35:55.945 --> 00:35:56.946
She hung up.

731
00:35:58.114 --> 00:35:59.115
- Just a bad connection.

732
00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:00.825
She'll call back.

733
00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.618
- Alex. I'm scared.

734
00:36:02.618 --> 00:36:03.828
- Of what?

735
00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:05.454
I mean. just look around you.

736
00:36:05.454 --> 00:36:06.956
We live in a great house.

737
00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:08.207
Our mom works nights.

738
00:36:08.207 --> 00:36:10.668
We have a neighbor who
absolutely adores us.

739
00:36:12.044 --> 00:36:14.046
I mean. life couldn't
be better. right?

740
00:36:14.046 --> 00:36:16.716
- If you're trying to be
funny. it's not working.

741
00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:17.633
- It is funny.

742
00:36:18.718 --> 00:36:19.802
The only thing is
God's telling the jokes

743
00:36:19.802 --> 00:36:21.470
and we're the punchline.

744
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:22.972
- Don't say that!

745
00:36:22.972 --> 00:36:24.140
(thudding)
(keys jingling)

746
00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.057

749
00:36:38.154 --> 00:36:40.489
- [Mom] Hey guys. I'm home.

750
00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:41.657
- Mommy!

751
00:36:41.657 --> 00:36:43.159
I'm so glad to see you!

752
00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:44.827
- That's a homecoming.

753
00:36:44.827 --> 00:36:46.329
Alex?

754
00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:47.163
- Hey. mom.

755
00:36:48.247 --> 00:36:50.082
- Your greetings are
actually getting better.

756
00:36:50.082 --> 00:36:51.584
All right. to bed in 15.

757
00:36:51.584 --> 00:36:52.668
It's getting late.

758
00:36:54.337 --> 00:36:56.756
All right. come on sweetie.
we gotta get to bed.

759
00:36:58.007 --> 00:37:00.051
Oh. and don't forget
to brush your teeth.

760
00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:02.011
- But I brushed them yesterday!

761
00:37:03.095 --> 00:37:04.764
- Oh. this place is a mess.

762
00:37:04.764 --> 00:37:07.600
(exhausted music)

763
00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:15.024
Alex. why are you all sweaty?

764
00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:16.859
- I was working out.

765
00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:18.694
- You shouldn't be
running at night.

766
00:37:18.694 --> 00:37:21.030
And who's watching your sister?

767
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.784
(perplexed electronic music)

768
00:37:37.546 --> 00:37:39.548
- [Alex] Why are you
hiding stuff from us?

769
00:37:39.548 --> 00:37:40.883
- Excuse me?

770
00:37:40.883 --> 00:37:42.885
- I found something.

771
00:37:42.885 --> 00:37:44.220
- What's that?

772
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.388
- Something from dad.

773
00:37:45.388 --> 00:37:46.722
like one of his
books or something.

774
00:37:46.722 --> 00:37:48.224
- Well you know your dad.

775
00:37:48.224 --> 00:37:49.475
He's a writer.

776
00:37:49.475 --> 00:37:50.893
He writes stuff.

777
00:37:50.893 --> 00:37:52.103
- Don't you think me
and Jessica need to know

778
00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:54.063
about stuff like this?

779
00:37:54.063 --> 00:37:55.481
Has he mentioned this?

780
00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:57.900
- He said he was writing
a play or something.

781
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.235
- What else has he written?

782
00:38:00.152 --> 00:38:01.279
- A few things.

783
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:02.571
- I wanna see them.

784
00:38:02.571 --> 00:38:03.781
All of them.

785
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.283
- You need to go to bed

786
00:38:05.283 --> 00:38:06.909
or you can hand
me your car keys.

787
00:38:08.077 --> 00:38:09.912
- You should use
truth and not power.

788
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.750
- And now he's a philosopher.

789
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.253

790
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:40.276

793

- Are you okay?

794
00:40:04.026 --> 00:40:04.860
What happened?

795
00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.279
- I. I did it last time.

796
00:40:07.279 --> 00:40:10.074
- You gotta stop this
twisting and twirling.

797
00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.367
- But it's my recital.

798
00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.620
(sad music)

799
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.372
- [Christina] I was in the
hospital for almost two days.

800
00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:17.248
- What?

801
00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:18.958
- Doing that stuff. gymnastics.

802
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:20.793
I fell down the stairs
when I was five.

803

My

804
00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:24.046
still hurts from time to time.

805
00:40:24.046 --> 00:40:25.548
- Me too. ouch!

806
00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:27.716
- You might wanna put
some ice on that tonight.

807
00:40:27.716 --> 00:40:29.218
- Will do.

808
00:40:29.218 --> 00:40:30.970
Sounds like you've had your
shares of ups and downs.

809
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.054
- Haven't we all?

810
00:40:32.054 --> 00:40:33.889
- Don't get me started.

811
00:40:33.889 --> 00:40:35.891
- Hey. how's your neighbor?

812
00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:37.435
- [Alex] I actually paid
him a visit last night.

813
00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:38.394
- Really. what'd he say?

814
00:40:38.394 --> 00:40:39.562
- Nothing.

815
00:40:39.562 --> 00:40:40.980
til he came home.

816
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.481
I probably should've let
him know I was coming over.

817
00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:43.732
- [Christina] Yeah.

818
00:40:43.732 --> 00:40:45.609
- It's a real den of
iniquity over there.

819
00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:47.445
He's hiding something
major in the basement.

820
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:48.279
- What do you mean?

821
00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:49.822
- Took my phone.

822
00:40:49.822 --> 00:40:51.449

910
00:43:38.407 --> 00:43:40.075
but the firemen sure did.

911
00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:42.119
♪ Even if the chains

912
00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:44.747
♪ Bring me down

913
00:43:44.747 --> 00:43:49.752
♪ I wanna go

914
00:43:50.419 --> 00:43:52.671
♪ I wanna go

915
00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:55.924
(clock ticking)

916
00:43:55.924 --> 00:43:57.134
- All clear?

917
00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:59.261
- Hey. uh. sorry
about my sister.

918
00:43:59.261 --> 00:44:01.096
She kinda may squeal sometimes.

919
00:44:01.096 --> 00:44:02.431
- That's okay.

920
00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:04.600
Wow. you clean up nice.

921
00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.434
- Thanks.

922
00:44:05.434 --> 00:44:06.435
You too.

923
00:44:06.435 --> 00:44:07.936
- What?

924
00:44:07.936 --> 00:44:09.772
- I mean. I'm not saying that
you need a bath or anything.

925
00:44:09.772 --> 00:44:10.939
I'm just. I.

926
00:44:10.939 --> 00:44:12.858
you look nice. that's
what I'm saying.

927
00:44:12.858 --> 00:44:14.109
- I know what you mean.

928
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:15.944
but I see you aim to please.

929
00:44:15.944 --> 00:44:16.779
- What?

930
00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:18.280
- The shirt.

931
00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.156
- Oh.

932
00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:20.449
- There's something about it.

933
00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:23.035
Do you have more than one?

934
00:44:23.035 --> 00:44:24.953
- No. this is the shirt.

935
00:44:26.038 --> 00:44:28.332
- There's just
something different.

936
00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:29.291
But I like it.

937
00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:30.125
- Good.

938
00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.378
You know what they say.

939
00:44:32.378 --> 00:44:33.879
- And what do they say. Alex?

940
00:44:33.879 --> 00:44:35.631
- You gotta keep the
customer satisfied.

941
00:44:35.631 --> 00:44:36.382
- Really?

942
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:39.968
Hey. so what's going
on with your neighbor?

943
00:44:39.968 --> 00:44:41.637
- Got something that'll
give you a sleepless night.

944
00:44:41.637 --> 00:44:44.223
(creepy music)

945
00:44:49.144 --> 00:44:50.813
And cut.

946
00:44:50.813 --> 00:44:51.980
The end.

947
00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.148
What do you think?

948
00:44:53.148 --> 00:44:55.150
- I think it gives
me the creeps.

949
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:56.819
Do you really think
she's in that box?

950
00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:58.320
It could just be power tools.

951
00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.154
- Negative.

952
00:44:59.154 --> 00:45:00.155
The length and shape.

953
00:45:00.155 --> 00:45:01.740
that's either his wife

954
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:03.200
or what's left of her.

955
00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.160
- Okay. now you're
really freaking me out.

956
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.245
- I'm just saying.

957
00:45:06.245 --> 00:45:08.247
We've got a killer on the loose.

958
00:45:08.247 --> 00:45:10.582
It's my neighborhood.
it's my problem.

959
00:45:10.582 --> 00:45:12.501
- And what are you. Batman?

960
00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:14.670
I know the perfect people
that could help out with this.

961
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.256
They have these bright
lights on top of their cars.

962
00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:20.008
Most people call
them the police.

963
00:45:20.008 --> 00:45:21.844
- It's a cold case. Christina.

964
00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:23.262
It's a missing person.

965
00:45:23.262 --> 00:45:24.888
They've got private
investigators on it now

966
00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:26.515
and I'm helping out.

967
00:45:26.515 --> 00:45:28.016
- I don't know.

968
00:45:28.016 --> 00:45:30.102
I was always taught that if it
makes your hair stand on end.

969
00:45:30.102 --> 00:45:31.270
don't.

970
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:32.563
And that's how I'm
feeling right about now.

971
00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:34.022
- Oh come on.

972
00:45:34.022 --> 00:45:36.066
Sometimes you gotta flirt
with danger to find the truth.

973
00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:38.610
- And what are you. some
two-bit philosopher?

974
00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:40.195
This guy could
really mess you up.

975
00:45:40.195 --> 00:45:42.698
like rest in peace kinda stuff.

976
00:45:42.698 --> 00:45:44.074
- Well then I'd just be a ghost.

977
00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:45.868
kinda floating around. you know.

978
00:45:45.868 --> 00:45:48.287
Maybe I'd come
back and haunt you.

979
00:45:48.287 --> 00:45:50.289
Or is that what
you're afraid of?

980
00:45:50.289 --> 00:45:53.542
- Alex. once you die.
you don't come back.

981
00:45:53.542 --> 00:45:55.043
You don't float around.

982
00:45:55.043 --> 00:45:56.545
It doesn't work like that.

983
00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:57.713
- Really?

984
00:45:57.713 --> 00:45:59.214
You sound like my mom.

985
00:45:59.214 --> 00:46:02.217
Besides. I don't plan on
dying anytime soon anyways.

986
00:46:03.218 --> 00:46:05.304
- Neither did my best friend.

987
00:46:05.304 --> 00:46:06.096
- Best friend?

988
00:46:07.556 --> 00:46:10.142
- Yeah. but I can't really
talk about it right now.

989
00:46:10.142 --> 00:46:11.226
- Oh come on Christina.

990
00:46:11.226 --> 00:46:12.060
What happened?

991
00:46:15.647 --> 00:46:18.108
- Last summer she was in
her car in front of me

992
00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:20.235
driving like crazy.

993
00:46:20.235 --> 00:46:22.738
Anyways. I came up the rise

994
00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:25.240
and saw this orange
glow by a tree.

995
00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.408
And I knew it was her.

996
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.578
I did everything I could to
help her get out of her car.

997
00:46:29.578 --> 00:46:31.246
but it was too late.

998
00:46:32.414 --> 00:46:34.082
Her cries sent shivers
(woman screaming)

999
00:46:34.082 --> 00:46:35.751
down my spine.

1000
00:46:35.751 --> 00:46:38.754
I can still hear her screaming.
"Help me. I'm burning."

1001
00:46:41.507 --> 00:46:43.091
- I'm really sorry.

1002
00:46:43.091 --> 00:46:47.179
- Have you ever seen what
fire does to long blonde hair

1003
00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:48.680
soaked in hairspray?

1004
00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.266
(woeful music)

1005
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:55.270
It's like etched in my brain.

1006
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:56.146
but that's not it.

1007
00:46:57.189 --> 00:46:58.148
- What do you mean?

1008
00:46:59.274 --> 00:47:00.692
- The purse.

1009
00:47:00.692 --> 00:47:01.693
- Purse?

1010
00:47:01.693 --> 00:47:04.446
(haunting music)

1011
00:47:06.532 --> 00:47:08.033
- Her purse lying
on the asphalt.

1012
00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:10.786
with something I gave her
sticking out of the top.

1013
00:47:10.786 --> 00:47:11.787
- [Alex] What was it?

1014
00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:16.333
The envelope.

1015
00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:20.045
- Before the
paramedics got there.

1016
00:47:20.045 --> 00:47:22.798
I went over and got
this out of her purse.

1017
00:47:22.798 --> 00:47:25.509
Maybe that was wrong.
but I had to keep it.

1018
00:47:26.885 --> 00:47:29.471
Mr. Harper gave it to me
when I was only 10 years old.

1019
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:31.223
and that's when I read it.

1020
00:47:31.223 --> 00:47:33.016
That's when what
it said changed me.

1021
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:36.019
I guess it's a part of me now.

1022
00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:36.979
- Really?

1023
00:47:36.979 --> 00:47:37.813
A gospel tract?

1024
00:47:38.647 --> 00:47:40.148
- Do you know?

1025
00:47:40.148 --> 00:47:42.150
- Yes. Christina. I've gone
to Sunday school before.

1026
00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:44.695
- I met God.

1027
00:47:45.654 --> 00:47:46.864
Or He met me.

1028
00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:49.658
But I feel different.

1029
00:47:49.658 --> 00:47:50.826
- You got saved?

1030
00:47:50.826 --> 00:47:52.077
- Yeah. I did.

1031
00:47:54.162 --> 00:47:55.998
I gave this to my friend

1032
00:47:55.998 --> 00:47:58.083
and told her to read
it within five days.

1033
00:47:58.917 --> 00:48:00.836
- [Alex] Well did she?

1034
00:48:00.836 --> 00:48:02.838
- On the fifth day
the accident happened.

1035
00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:05.007
- [Alex] I'm sure she read it.

1036
00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:05.841
She'll be just fine.

1037
00:48:05.841 --> 00:48:07.175
- No. she didn't.

1038
00:48:07.175 --> 00:48:09.344
- Don't be so
negative. Christina.

1039
00:48:09.344 --> 00:48:10.178
How do you know?

1040
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:13.015
- You see this?

1041
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:17.060
I put this here when I
asked her to read it.

1042
00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.396
It's the same as it was
when I gave it to her.

1043
00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:20.522
still unbroken.

1044
00:48:23.025 --> 00:48:23.942
- I'm really sorry.

1045
00:48:25.527 --> 00:48:27.362
Maybe God made an
exception for her.

1046
00:48:27.362 --> 00:48:28.447
- No.

1047
00:48:28.447 --> 00:48:29.865
No exceptions.

1048
00:48:29.865 --> 00:48:32.034
You get one lifetime
to make your decision.

1049
00:48:32.034 --> 00:48:33.368
then game over.

1050
00:48:33.368 --> 00:48:35.370
You don't just float
around or hang out.

1051
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:37.706
You're separated
from God forever.

1052
00:48:37.706 --> 00:48:39.041
- Okay. stop!

1053
00:48:39.041 --> 00:48:39.958
I'm not ready for this.

1054
00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:40.876
- For what?

1055
00:48:40.876 --> 00:48:41.877
- This!

1056
00:48:41.877 --> 00:48:43.128
I know what you're getting at.

1057
00:48:43.128 --> 00:48:44.212
It's not my time.

1058
00:48:44.212 --> 00:48:45.380
I'm not ready.

1059
00:48:47.382 --> 00:48:49.259
- [Christina] Well then
promise me this one thing.

1060
00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:50.761
- And what's that?

1061
00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:52.471
- [Christina] You'll carry
this tract for five days

1062
00:48:52.471 --> 00:48:55.307
and remember the
story I told you.

1063
00:48:56.475 --> 00:48:57.559
- Yeah. sure.

1064
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:01.813
- Don't wait til day five.

1065
00:49:01.813 --> 00:49:04.149
Seems to be the unlucky day.

1066
00:49:05.734 --> 00:49:10.072
And there's one more thing
that's been bothering me.

1067
00:49:10.989 --> 00:49:11.823
- Yeah?

1068
00:49:13.241 --> 00:49:15.786
- You know that
shirt you're wearing?

1069
00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:17.287
- Yeah.

1070
00:49:17.287 --> 00:49:18.413
- It's on backwards.

1071
00:49:18.413 --> 00:49:21.583

00:49:58.328 --> 00:49:59.621
- [Christina
Voiceover] Yeah. I did.

1089
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:01.289
- Okay. stop. I'm
not ready for this.

1090
00:50:01.289 --> 00:50:03.792
(misty music)

1091
00:50:05.293 --> 00:50:06.503
(sirens wailing)

1092
00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:09.631
(heartbeat pounding)

1093
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.302
- [Christina Voiceover]
No. no exceptions.

1094
00:50:14.302 --> 00:50:16.388
You get one lifetime
to make your decision.

1095
00:50:16.388 --> 00:50:17.639
then game over.

1096
00:50:17.639 --> 00:50:19.683
You don't just float
around and hang out.

1097
00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:22.644
You're separated
from God forever.

1098
00:50:22.644 --> 00:50:25.313
(thunder rumbling)

1099
00:50:25.313 --> 00:50:28.066
(haunting music)

1100
00:50:32.988 --> 00:50:35.657
(clock ticking)

1101
00:50:35.657 --> 00:50:38.160
(dog barking)

1102
00:50:56.011 --> 00:50:57.429
- I really don't like those.

1103
00:50:57.429 --> 00:50:59.097
I just fake it.

1104
00:50:59.097 --> 00:51:00.015
- Really?

1105
00:51:00.015 --> 00:51:01.183
How old are you?

1106
00:51:01.183 --> 00:51:02.851
You need to eat your fruit.

1107
00:51:02.851 --> 00:51:04.728
It's good Vitamin C.

1108
00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:06.855
(Jessica sighs)

1109
00:51:06.855 --> 00:51:09.608
(engine rumbling)

1110
00:51:09.608 --> 00:51:11.359
(tires squealing)

1111
00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:13.779
(eerie music)

1112
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.590
- [Christina Voiceover] Well
then promise me this one thing.

1113
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.967
You'll carry this
tract for five days

1114
00:51:35.967 --> 00:51:38.053
and you'll remember
the story I told you.

1115
00:51:38.053 --> 00:51:40.722
(shadowy music)

1116
00:51:47.896 --> 00:51:50.273
(metallic clinking)

1117
00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:53.276
(Jessica squealing)

1118
00:51:55.153 --> 00:51:57.906
(heavenly music)

1119
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:25.433
(heartbeat pounding)

1120
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:41.158
(moves into ominous music)

1121
00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.284
- Here's something
or you. kiddo.

1122
00:52:42.284 --> 00:52:44.870
(creepy music)

1123
00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:52.294
(banging)

1124
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:19.654
- What?

1125
00:53:19.654 --> 00:53:21.489
- A plan for tonight.
five minutes. my room.

1126
00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:23.992
(Jessica sighs)

1127
00:53:23.992 --> 00:53:26.161
I've been doing some spying
on the man next door.

1128
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:27.162
- Yeah?

1129
00:53:27.162 --> 00:53:28.580
- And I've discovered something.

1130
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:31.166
His car always leaves at
the same time on Thursdays.

1131
00:53:31.166 --> 00:53:32.709
8:30 sharp.

1132
00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:34.586
- Why do you think Thursdays?

1133
00:53:34.586 --> 00:53:35.503
- I don't know.

1134
00:53:35.503 --> 00:53:37.380
Maybe he's taken up bowling.

1135
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:40.008
The point is he doesn't
come back til like 11:00.

1136
00:53:40.008 --> 00:53:41.676
which gives us a
pretty good window.

1137
00:53:41.676 --> 00:53:44.512
(doorbell rings)

1138
00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:49.184
- You know littering is
like a $500 fine. don't you?

1139
00:53:49.184 --> 00:53:50.685
- [Jessica] Hey. Christina.

1140
00:53:50.685 --> 00:53:52.395
- But I'll let it
slide this time.

1141
00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:55.023
Hey Alex. this has your
name on it a couple times.

1142
00:53:55.023 --> 00:53:56.191
You want it back?

1143
00:53:56.191 --> 00:53:57.609
- There's like four
Alexes on this block.

1144
00:53:57.609 --> 00:53:59.194
It's probably one of the
ones down the street.

1145
00:53:59.194 --> 00:54:00.028
- Got it.

1146
00:54:01.112 --> 00:54:01.947
Wanna go along?

1147
00:54:04.783 --> 00:54:06.701
And I thought you
wanted to go pro.

1148
00:54:06.701 --> 00:54:07.953
- Too short.

1149
00:54:07.953 --> 00:54:09.871
- And about 200
pounds too light.

1150
00:54:09.871 --> 00:54:11.206
Hey Christina. you got a second?

1151
00:54:11.206 --> 00:54:12.207
- [Christina] Yeah.

1152
00:54:12.207 --> 00:54:14.709
(scary music)

1153
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.097
- Then his car is gone.

1154
00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:28.723
which I think is a
good time to strike.

1155
00:54:28.723 --> 00:54:29.557
- Okay. question.

1156
00:54:29.557 --> 00:54:30.892
Strike what?

1157
00:54:30.892 --> 00:54:32.310
- Yeah. Alex. what
are you gonna do.

1158
00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:34.229
send in your ground forces?

1159
00:54:34.229 --> 00:54:35.605
- No.

1160
00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:37.482
But I do wanna see what's
in that box though.

1161
00:54:37.482 --> 00:54:39.734
- There's no way
unless you go inside.

1162
00:54:39.734 --> 00:54:40.902
- Exactly.

1163
00:54:40.902 --> 00:54:42.237
- Excuse me?

1164
00:54:42.237 --> 00:54:43.238
- He'll be gone.

1165
00:54:43.238 --> 00:54:44.072
- And what if he isn't?

1166
00:54:44.072 --> 00:54:45.282
Guess what?

1167
00:54:45.282 --> 00:54:46.741
(Jessica imitates choking)
Exactly.

1168
00:54:46.741 --> 00:54:48.785
Lights out. a
permanent night night.

1169
00:54:48.785 --> 00:54:50.245
- Yeah. Alex.

1170
00:54:50.245 --> 00:54:52.122
He probably has booby traps
in his house. you know.

1171
00:54:52.122 --> 00:54:53.290
- I guess I'm just worried

1172
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:54.249
that you're not
thinking this through.

1173
00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:56.459
like all the consequences.

1174
00:54:56.459 --> 00:54:59.504
- Look. nothing ventured
nothing gained. right?

1175
00:54:59.504 --> 00:55:01.006
- I remember that one.

1176
00:55:01.006 --> 00:55:03.508
The guy that said that died
in the desert. didn't he?

1177
00:55:03.508 --> 00:55:06.428
- (laughs) Look. I've got
like a two-hour window.

1178
00:55:06.428 --> 00:55:07.679
He'll never know I was there.

1179
00:55:07.679 --> 00:55:08.930
- Wait a second.

1180
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:10.515
Can't you just give
all this information

1181
00:55:10.515 --> 00:55:13.601
to the investigators and
let them do the dirty work?

1182
00:55:13.601 --> 00:55:15.270
- These investigators
are counting on me.

1183
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.188
you know. to solve the case.

1184
00:55:17.188 --> 00:55:20.483
And maybe to make the 6:00 news.

1185
00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:22.444
- Okay. Bruce Wayne.

1186
00:55:22.444 --> 00:55:24.487
- Actually. I could
live with that.

1187
00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:26.281
- You're insane.

1188
00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:28.533
I can't believe we're
even talking like this.

1189
00:55:28.533 --> 00:55:30.869
- Hey. you said you wanted
a change in pace. right?

1190
00:55:30.869 --> 00:55:32.120
Kinda boring next door.

1191
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.998
- I meant something that
didn't end in a funeral.

1192
00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:36.458
- I need someone
to watch my back.

1193
00:55:36.458 --> 00:55:38.168
and Jess is too short.

1194
00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:39.169
- Thanks. Alex.

1195
00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.545
- You're half crazy!

1196
00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:44.049
But you're just too cute.

1197
00:55:44.049 --> 00:55:46.676
And I'm insane for saying
this that I'll be in.

1198
00:55:46.676 --> 00:55:48.303
but under one condition.

1199
00:55:48.303 --> 00:55:49.721
- What's that?

1200
00:55:49.721 --> 00:55:52.140
- You won't make me
dress up as Wonder Woman.

1201
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.308
- Bummer.

1202
00:55:53.308 --> 00:55:55.143
(Jessica and Christina laughing)

1203
00:55:55.143 --> 00:55:56.644
All right. it's a deal.

1204
00:55:56.644 --> 00:55:58.313
Jess. you'll be at HQ.

1205
00:55:58.313 --> 00:56:00.148
You'll be our eyes in the sky.

1206
00:56:00.148 --> 00:56:01.066
- Affirmative.

1207
00:56:01.066 --> 00:56:03.651
- We'll call you Mother Goose.

1208
00:56:03.651 --> 00:56:04.569
- Nice.

1209
00:56:04.569 --> 00:56:06.654
(phone rings)
I'll get it.

1210
00:56:06.654 --> 00:56:07.489
Hello?

1211
00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:09.866
Hello. mommy. is that you?

1212
00:56:11.076 --> 00:56:12.202
Nobody's there.

1213
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:15.997
- Hello?

1214
00:56:15.997 --> 00:56:18.500
(tense music)

1215
00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:25.173
(dial tone beeping)

1216
00:56:29.677 --> 00:56:30.512
- Meow!

1217
00:56:30.512 --> 00:56:31.679
- [Alex] Say what?

1218
00:56:31.679 --> 00:56:33.765
- You look like a
black kitty cat.

1219
00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:35.892
- This is how you dress
for a covert operation.

1220
00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:38.395
- Yeah. a covert whatever.

1221
00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:40.021
- I think I have
everything I need.

1222
00:56:40.021 --> 00:56:40.939
Wish me luck.

1223
00:56:40.939 --> 00:56:42.023
- Luck.

1224
00:56:42.023 --> 00:56:44.025
Be careful. Alex.

1225
00:56:44.025 --> 00:56:45.026
- Thanks. kiddo.

1226
00:56:46.277 --> 00:56:49.239
(fingers snapping)

1227
00:56:49.239 --> 00:56:52.617
- Hey. you look like that guy
from the termite commercial.

1228
00:56:52.617 --> 00:56:54.786
- Maybe you know me
better by my last name.

1229
00:56:54.786 --> 00:56:56.371
Talk to Jones.

1230
00:56:56.371 --> 00:56:57.789
- [Jessica] But you
look like termite--

1231
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:59.707
- Sh. just go with it.

1232
00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:00.792
Is Christina here yet?

1233
00:57:00.792 --> 00:57:01.709
(doorbell rings)

1234
00:57:01.709 --> 00:57:02.544
Never mind.

1235
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.382
- I don't know which is worse.

1236
00:57:07.382 --> 00:57:09.884
the butterflies in my stomach
or the lump in my throat.

1237
00:57:09.884 --> 00:57:11.052
How do you feel?

1238
00:57:11.052 --> 00:57:12.429
- I don't know.

1239
00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:14.556
Kind of like I feel
before a big game.

1240
00:57:14.556 --> 00:57:15.432
We might have a problem.

1241
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:16.391
Check this out.

1242
00:57:16.391 --> 00:57:18.935
(creepy music)

1243
00:57:21.646 --> 00:57:23.731
- Maybe he's staying
in for the night.

1244
00:57:23.731 --> 00:57:25.567
The weather looks pretty bad.

1245
00:57:25.567 --> 00:57:27.068
(phone rings)

1246
00:57:27.068 --> 00:57:29.571
- Sheesh. and I
thought I was antsy.

1247
00:57:29.571 --> 00:57:32.323
(dreadful music)

1248
00:57:41.458 --> 00:57:43.293
- His car's still there.

1249
00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:44.502
- I can see that. Jess.

1250
00:57:44.502 --> 00:57:46.754
- You mean Mother Goose.

1251
00:57:46.754 --> 00:57:48.756
- I can see that. Mother Goose.

1252
00:57:48.756 --> 00:57:49.924
- 10-four.

1253
00:57:49.924 --> 00:57:51.759
Otherwise. everything
looks good from HQ.

1254
00:57:51.759 --> 00:57:53.011
Mother Goose. out!

1255
00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:56.973
- Why did I have to
give her a call sign?

1256
00:57:59.684 --> 00:58:00.518
Get down!

1257
00:58:00.518 --> 00:58:01.936
(keys jingling)

1258
00:58:01.936 --> 00:58:04.856
(footsteps thudding)

1259
00:58:04.856 --> 00:58:07.859
(suspenseful music)

1260
00:58:08.943 --> 00:58:11.613
(engine rumbling)

1261
00:58:11.613 --> 00:58:12.614
- [Christina] Whoa.

1262
00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:13.990
- What's wrong?

1263
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.658
- I think my heart
just skipped a beat.

1264
00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:16.826
- Already?

1265
00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:19.287
- Why. is there a better time?

1266
00:58:19.287 --> 00:58:22.123
- Yeah. when we're crawling
through his basement window.

1267
00:58:23.958 --> 00:58:25.001
We better gear up.

1268
00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:26.503
- Intense.

1269
00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:27.462
- Got a little weapon for you.

1270
00:58:27.462 --> 00:58:29.172
- What. no. I can't shoot.

1271
00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:30.006
- You don't have to.

1272
00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:30.840
Just aim.

1273
00:58:31.799 --> 00:58:33.635
- Gee. thanks.

1274
00:58:33.635 --> 00:58:35.637
You didn't have anything
smaller to give me. did you?

1275
00:58:35.637 --> 00:58:38.139
- Hey. it's a nice light.

1276
00:58:38.139 --> 00:58:39.641
Any second thoughts?

1277
00:58:39.641 --> 00:58:42.185
- Oh. you'd be
the first to know.

1278
00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.019
- Gotcha.

1279
00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:45.480
(scary music)

1280
00:58:51.986 --> 00:58:53.488
- [Jessica] Looks like
we have a problem.

1281
00:58:53.488 --> 00:58:54.864
- What's that?

1282
00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:55.823
- Looks like the backyard
gate was left open.

1283
00:58:55.823 --> 00:58:57.825
but it's kinda hard to see.

1284
00:58:57.825 --> 00:58:58.660
- Great.

1285
00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.994
Any sign of that dog?

1286
00:58:59.994 --> 00:59:01.204
- Negative.

1287
00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:02.330
- [Alex] Jess. I need
you to come downstairs.

1288
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:04.082
- You mean leave the HQ?

1289
00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:05.333
- Yes. Jess. I need
you to leave HQ

1290
00:59:05.333 --> 00:59:07.001
and meet me
downstairs right now.

1291
00:59:07.001 --> 00:59:07.835
- Affirmative!

1292
00:59:07.835 --> 00:59:09.003
Mother Goose out!

1293
00:59:11.339 --> 00:59:13.007
- [Alex] Jess. I need
you to the backyard.

1294
00:59:13.007 --> 00:59:13.925
- Why for?

1295
00:59:13.925 --> 00:59:14.759
- Because of the gate.

1296
00:59:14.759 --> 00:59:15.593
- The dog.

1297
00:59:15.593 --> 00:59:16.511
- You got it.

1298
00:59:16.511 --> 00:59:17.512
If he gets out. it's game over.

1299
00:59:17.512 --> 00:59:18.721
I need you to listen to me.

1300
00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:20.014
I want you to go back there

1301
00:59:20.014 --> 00:59:21.099
and put your iPad in
the hole in the fence.

1302
00:59:21.099 --> 00:59:22.016
You'll be safe there.

1303
00:59:22.016 --> 00:59:23.351
- To spy on the mean dog?

1304
00:59:23.351 --> 00:59:24.769
- Exactly.

1305
00:59:24.769 --> 00:59:26.437
You're gonna give me a constant
view of whatever he's up to.

1306
00:59:26.437 --> 00:59:28.690
Me and Christina are
gonna go stay back.

1307
00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:30.191
Any questions?

1308
00:59:30.191 --> 00:59:32.694
Don't worry. we got this.

1309
00:59:32.694 --> 00:59:33.611
Ready?

1310
00:59:33.611 --> 00:59:34.612
- Break!

1311
00:59:34.612 --> 00:59:36.531
(wind chimes clinking)

1312
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:39.367
(thrilling music)

1313
00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:49.919
You know what?

1314
00:59:49.919 --> 00:59:51.462
- What?

1315
00:59:51.462 --> 00:59:54.048
- I can think of 1.001 things
I'd rather be doing right now.

1316
00:59:54.048 --> 00:59:55.550
- Oh come on.

1317
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:56.801
I'm about to give you a
summer you'll never forget.

1318
00:59:56.801 --> 01:00:00.388
(thunder rumbling)

1319
01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:02.640
- Hey. I just thought
of one more thing.

1320
01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.476
(terrified music)

1321
01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:27.582
- [Jessica] Stop. Alex!

1322
01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:28.916
- What?

1323
01:00:28.916 --> 01:00:29.751
- Listen!

1324
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:33.755
I see the dog!

1325
01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:34.589
- Where?

1326
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:35.590
(dog barking)

1327
01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:36.924
- Coming your way!

1328
01:00:36.924 --> 01:00:38.134
You better run!

1329
01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:40.845
Alex. hurry!

1330
01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:43.348
(dog barking)

1331
01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.683
- Christina. get over here!

1332
01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.269
- [Christina] What
do you want me to do?

1333
01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:49.187
- Get the screwdriver
out of my pocket!

1334
01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:50.104
- [Christina] What?

1335
01:00:50.104 --> 01:00:51.439
- My pocket. the screwdriver!

1336
01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:52.523
Other pocket!

1337
01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:55.276
Put it in the latch!

1338
01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:56.611
Over that plank!

1339
01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.823
- Okay. my hearts not
skipping beats anymore.

1340
01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:01.824
- [Alex] That's good.

1341
01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:02.784
- No.

1342
01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:04.285
My heart's not beating at all.

1343
01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:07.372
- Jessica.

1344
01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:08.289
Jessica!

1345
01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:11.167
(mysterious music)

1346
01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:15.505
Jess!

1347
01:01:16.464 --> 01:01:17.298
- Jessica!

1348
01:01:17.298 --> 01:01:19.884
(ominous music)

1349
01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:27.642
- Jessica?

1350
01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:31.521
You okay?

1351
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:34.691
(emotional music)

1352
01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:35.650
- I wanna go home.

1353
01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:37.985
- You are home.

1354
01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:40.655
- I don't mean
here. my real home.

1355
01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.407
I don't wanna be here anymore.

1356
01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:45.493
- That makes two of us.

1357
01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:48.037
(aching music)

1358
01:02:03.177 --> 01:02:05.513
I'm sure she'll be all right.

1359
01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:08.015
- Nothing a little psych
treatment can't help. huh?

1360
01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:10.518
(Alex laughs)

1361
01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:14.731
- All right. we
got about an hour.

1362
01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.441
- Are you kidding me?

1363
01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.192
And all I have is
this pee light!

1364
01:02:18.192 --> 01:02:19.402
- It's a pen light.

1365
01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.529
- Oh. like that
makes it any better.

1366
01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:24.615
I was almost eaten by the
beast of the backyard.

1367
01:02:24.615 --> 01:02:26.576
Oh. and if that's
not bad enough.

1368
01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:29.036
I just ruined my
best pair of shoes.

1369
01:02:30.371 --> 01:02:33.708
Can't we just call it a night
and snuggle our pillows?

1370
01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:34.792
- I gotta go.

1371
01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:36.878
Now I'm asking for your help.

1372
01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.379
I don't wanna do
this without you.

1373
01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:40.882
- Oh. I guess I
should feel touched.

1374
01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:42.133
(cellphone ringing)

1375
01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:42.967
- Hold on.

1376
01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:43.801
It's Jessica.

1377
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:46.888
- [Jessica] Mother
Goose to Alex.

1378
01:02:46.888 --> 01:02:48.055
- [Alex] Go ahead. Mother Goose.

1379
01:02:48.055 --> 01:02:49.557
- I called to let
you know something.

1380
01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:51.058
- Go ahead.

1381
01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:54.228
- I wanted to let you know
that HQ is back online!

1382
01:02:54.228 --> 01:02:55.897
- (laughs) Atta girl.

1383
01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.648
- Oh. I must be dreaming.

1384
01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:01.152
Oh. now I see.

1385
01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:02.069
- What's that?

1386
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:03.237
- The psychological problems

1387
01:03:03.237 --> 01:03:05.406
run throughout
this entire family!

1388
01:03:05.406 --> 01:03:08.159
(questing music)

1389
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.252
I thought you said the
window was half open!

1390
01:03:18.252 --> 01:03:19.462
- Shh!

1391
01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.922
I don't want that
dog freak out again.

1392
01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:22.799
It was.

1393
01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.593
(uncertain music)

1394
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:36.771
(thunder rumbling)

1395
01:03:42.443 --> 01:03:44.612
(banging)

1396
01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:21.816
- What's going on?

1397
01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:22.650
- Hurry!

1398
01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.862
- This is turning freaky fast.

1399
01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.989
- Alex. you have like a minute.

1400
01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:29.073
Please hurry.

1401
01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:29.991
- I am.

1402
01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:31.158
Stop telling me the time.

1403
01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:33.661
(scary music)

1404
01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:03.733
Whoa.

1405
01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:05.526
Tales From the Crypt.

1406
01:05:08.112 --> 01:05:09.530
- [Christina] Any
sign of that box?

1407
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:10.865
- Not yet.

1408
01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:12.199
You'll be the first to know.

1409
01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:14.869
(thunder rumbling)

1410
01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:16.037
(electric buzzing)

1411
01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:18.956
(terrifying music)

1412
01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.798
- Alex. get out of there!

1413
01:05:27.798 --> 01:05:30.301
(eerie music)

1414
01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:38.893
- Oh!

1415
01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:41.395
(misty music)

1416
01:05:45.232 --> 01:05:46.651
- Is that people?

1417
01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:48.736
Real people?

1418
01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.074
- It's just a mannequin.

1419
01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:54.408
(thunder rumbling)

1420
01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:57.286
(mysterious music)

1421
01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:01.457
Jessica. any movement
down the street?

1422
01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.291
- Checking!

1423
01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.087
Looks clear. but hurry!

1424
01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:08.923
- I see the box.

1425
01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:11.425
(scary music)

1426
01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.154
- Alex. hurry!

1427
01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.657
(eerie music)

1428
01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:57.304
- [Alex] What?

1429
01:06:57.304 --> 01:06:58.806
I. I don't get it.

1430
01:06:58.806 --> 01:07:00.808
- [Mom] Get what?

1431
01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:02.560
- [Alex] I don't
understand why you're here.

1432
01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.811
- Alex. it's mom.

1433
01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:04.645
You're home.

1434
01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:06.814
- [Alex] I saw him. last night.

1435
01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:09.400
Right there in front of me.

1436
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.234
- Saw who?

1437
01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:11.569
Who did you see?

1438
01:07:13.654 --> 01:07:14.530
- Dad.

1439
01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:17.158
(stormy music)

1440
01:07:21.328 --> 01:07:22.329
- Oh. I know.

1441
01:07:22.329 --> 01:07:23.497
He brought you home.

1442
01:07:23.497 --> 01:07:24.832
The weather was horrible.

1443
01:07:24.832 --> 01:07:26.709
- [Alex] Why was he there?

1444
01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:29.378
- I don't know. we
didn't talk much.

1445
01:07:29.378 --> 01:07:31.255
It. it was really late.

1446
01:07:31.255 --> 01:07:32.173
- I can't think right now.

1447
01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:33.924
My head's a beehive.

1448
01:07:33.924 --> 01:07:35.718
- Just let me get you something.

1449
01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:36.552
Relax.

1450
01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:39.346
(dreadful music)

1451
01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:46.353
About last night.

1452
01:07:46.353 --> 01:07:48.689
are you aware that
you were trespassing?

1453
01:07:48.689 --> 01:07:49.732
- Trespassing?

1454
01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.860
I don't think that's
the right word for it.

1455
01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.570
- Okay. then what is?

1456
01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:57.531
- Maybe unwelcomed invitation.

1457
01:07:57.531 --> 01:07:58.699
- Alex.

1458
01:07:58.699 --> 01:08:00.534
- Look. I was helping
out some detectives.

1459
01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:02.703
We were trying to solve a case.

1460
01:08:02.703 --> 01:08:04.205
You said I needed a job.

1461
01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:05.706
- Well that's good timing.

1462
01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:07.208
- What?

1463
01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:10.211
- There's a detective
here. wants to talk to you.

1464
01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:12.046
And he does not
look like he's here

1465
01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:13.798
to give you a paycheck.

1466
01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:14.882
- Right now?

1467
01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:16.383
- Unfortunately. yes.

1468
01:08:16.383 --> 01:08:18.886
And he just talked to your
little friend next door.

1469
01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.221
- Christina?

1470
01:08:20.221 --> 01:08:22.556
Mom. she's not my little friend.

1471
01:08:22.556 --> 01:08:23.766
She's 16. all right.

1472
01:08:23.766 --> 01:08:25.267
Is she okay?

1473
01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:26.727
- She's okay.

1474
01:08:26.727 --> 01:08:29.063
but I can't believe
you drug her into this.

1475
01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:30.397
- She never went in the house.

1476
01:08:30.397 --> 01:08:32.108
She was just there
to keep me company.

1477
01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:33.567
- And your little sister?

1478
01:08:33.567 --> 01:08:36.153
- Well technically. she
never left our house.

1479
01:08:36.153 --> 01:08:37.905
- Well that's comforting.

1480
01:08:37.905 --> 01:08:38.989
- [Alex] All right.

1481
01:08:38.989 --> 01:08:40.783
I see where this is going.

1482
01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.076
- Where?

1483
01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:44.286
- With me handing over
my keys. that's where.

1484
01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:46.455
- Oh. am I that predictable?

1485
01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:47.289
- No comment.

1486
01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:54.755
- I found something rather
intriguing last night.

1487
01:08:54.755 --> 01:08:58.592
Talks about a guy named Alex

1488
01:08:58.592 --> 01:09:01.595
exploring a spooky basement.

1489
01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:04.765
in search of a missing
person named Judith Light.

1490
01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:07.685
Alex. do you know
what this is about?

1491
01:09:10.437 --> 01:09:11.814
- Hm.

1492
01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.483
(clock ticking)

1493
01:09:16.777 --> 01:09:18.696
Did you bring your gun?

1494
01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:21.615
- Maybe.

1495
01:09:23.325 --> 01:09:24.451
- Do you ever use it?

1496
01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:27.454
- Oh. once or twice.

1497
01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:30.291
- Have you shot anybody?

1498
01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:33.460
- Just bad people.

1499
01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:34.628
- Oh.

1500
01:09:34.628 --> 01:09:37.006
- And people who talk a lot.

1501
01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:39.633
(veiled music)

1502
01:09:41.468 --> 01:09:43.679
Alex. we kinda have a mess here.

1503
01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:46.974
You stepping onto his property
was not a part of the deal.

1504
01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:49.518
- Well is the man next
door pressing charges?

1505
01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:50.728
- Well it's hard to say. ma'am.

1506
01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:52.313
I've only spoken to him briefly.

1507
01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:53.689
but I can tell you this.

1508
01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.649
He is not happy.

1509
01:09:55.649 --> 01:09:57.818
- Well Alex is only 17.

1510
01:09:57.818 --> 01:09:59.320
He's just a kid.

1511
01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.156
- Ma'am. 17 is considered
an adult in this state.

1512
01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:05.326
and frankly. your son
is in some serious...

1513
01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:08.412
Well. you know what I mean.

1514
01:10:08.412 --> 01:10:09.663
- You mean doodoo.

1515
01:10:09.663 --> 01:10:11.165
Is that what you mean?

1516
01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:13.584
- Uh. something like that.

1517
01:10:13.584 --> 01:10:15.502
- Jessica. I have a fresh
bar of soap in the bathroom.

1518
01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:17.254
Would you like to take a nibble?

1519
01:10:17.254 --> 01:10:18.547
- I'm just saying. mommy.

1520
01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:20.341
Alex might be going to jail.

1521
01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:21.592
- Jessica!

1522
01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:24.511
Sir. I'm sure if I can
speak to him directly.

1523
01:10:24.511 --> 01:10:25.846
we can sort things out.

1524
01:10:25.846 --> 01:10:27.181
- I'm afraid not. ma'am.

1525
01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:29.183
- Alex. you are going to jail!

1526
01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:30.017
- Jessica!

1527
01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:33.103
Excuse me.

1528
01:10:33.103 --> 01:10:35.898
Why don't you run outside and
catch me some butterflies.

1529
01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:38.359
- She just says that because
she wants me to leave.

1530
01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:39.860
- Thank you. sweetie. go on.

1531
01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:43.072
- But I haven't even
finished my breakfast yet.

1532
01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.281
Sheesh.

1533
01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:45.866
- And make sure you
throw your wrapper out.

1534
01:10:45.866 --> 01:10:48.535
in the trash this time.

1535
01:10:48.535 --> 01:10:50.371
(door slams)

1536
01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:51.705
- Can I ask a favor?

1537
01:10:51.705 --> 01:10:52.915
- Sure.

1538
01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:54.875
- I need to speak
to Alex privately.

1539
01:10:54.875 --> 01:10:57.086
- Oh. I don't think
I can do that.

1540
01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.088
I don't think I want to do that.

1541
01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.714
Aren't there any
parental rights here?

1542
01:11:00.714 --> 01:11:02.216
- I understand that.

1543
01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:04.718
but I need to corroborate his
story with the young girl's.

1544
01:11:04.718 --> 01:11:06.720
and you might be a distraction.

1545
01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.764
It'll just be a few minutes.

1546
01:11:08.764 --> 01:11:10.224
- All right. five minutes.

1547
01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:12.226
And Alex. tell him the truth.

1548
01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:15.479
- Yeah. sure mom.
whatever you say.

1549
01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:17.815
- Alex. I need to
show you something.

1550
01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:20.276
The briefcase.
let's look inside.

1551
01:11:20.276 --> 01:11:23.237
(suspenseful music)

1552
01:11:33.497 --> 01:11:37.751
Do you realize that most
ideas start off as words?

1553
01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:39.253
- Okay.

1554
01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:42.423
- And words tell us where
to go and what to do.

1555
01:11:42.423 --> 01:11:44.008
- What are you talking about?

1556
01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:44.925
- Let me show you.

1557
01:11:44.925 --> 01:11:46.302
Take a look at this paper.

1558
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.803
It has words on it.

1559
01:11:48.762 --> 01:11:49.805
But look closer.

1560
01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:52.266
They're telling you what to do.

1561
01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:56.145
- Christina brought over a
green sheet of paper like this.

1562
01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.772
- Hey Alex. this has your
name on it a couple times.

1563
01:11:58.772 --> 01:11:59.606
Do you want it back?

1564
01:11:59.606 --> 01:12:01.275
- Had my name on it.

1565
01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:02.860
- That's because you're in it.

1566
01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:04.111
- In what?

1567
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.279
- Here. let me show you.

1568
01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:08.032
(dramatic music)

1569
01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:18.959
- Is this some kinda joke!

1570
01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:21.712
- (laughs) You just
needed a starting point.

1571
01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:24.506
(perplexed music)

1572
01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:28.344
And some motivation
to get going.

1573
01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:33.390
Surrounded by
intriguing characters.

1574
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.809
- [Man] Hey kid. hold
that fence plank still.

1575
01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:37.728
- You became a vital
part of the story.

1576
01:12:38.979 --> 01:12:39.813
- [Alex Voiceover]
I found something.

1577
01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:41.148
something from dad.

1578
01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:42.816
like one of his
books or something.

1579
01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:44.234
- [Mom Voiceover] Well
you know your dad.

1580
01:12:44.234 --> 01:12:45.569
He's a writer.

1581
01:12:45.569 --> 01:12:46.904
He writes stuff.

1582
01:12:49.823 --> 01:12:52.493
(doorbell rings)

1583
01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:53.660
- Dad!

1584
01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:55.496
- Would you have
expected anything else?

1585
01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:58.999
From a desperate father?

1586
01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:04.171
- But. but all this. it's.
it's all make-believe?

1587
01:13:07.674 --> 01:13:09.343
Why would you do
something like this?

1588
01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:11.512
(voices rapidly talking
over each other)

1589
01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:14.348
(eerie music)

1590
01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:17.017
(clock ticking)

1591
01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:19.186
- [John] Listen.

1592
01:13:21.855 --> 01:13:22.940
Do you hear it?

1593
01:13:26.443 --> 01:13:27.361
It's the clock.

1594
01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:31.865
It mocks me.

1595
01:13:36.453 --> 01:13:38.705
Because it knows my secret.

1596
01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:43.377
- Maybe you should just stop.

1597
01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:45.045
just don't doing it.

1598
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:47.047
- [John] I can't.

1599
01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:48.257
- [Ron] Why?

1600
01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.884
- [John] Because
I've gone too far.

1601
01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.096
- [Alex Voiceover] This
is turning freaky fast.

1602
01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.264
- [Christina Voiceover] Alex!

1603
01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:56.890
You have like a
minute. please hurry!

1604
01:13:56.890 --> 01:13:58.559
- [Alex Voiceover] I am.
stop telling me the time!

1605
01:13:58.559 --> 01:14:01.270
(dramatic music)

1606
01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:07.943
- [Jessica Voiceover]
You've gotta hurry!

1607
01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.069
The man's home!

1608
01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:10.404
The man's home!

1609
01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.239
Get out of there!

1610
01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:13.157
- [John Voiceover] He's coming.

1611
01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:14.158
He's coming.

1612
01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.286
- [Jessica Voiceover]
Alex. please hurry!

1613
01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.412
Please hurry!

1614
01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:22.916
You've gotta get out of there!

1615
01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:24.751
- [Alex Voiceover] Jessica.
any movement down the street?

1616
01:14:24.751 --> 01:14:26.587
(bells jingling)

1617
01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:28.088
- [John] Where did I
find you last night?

1618
01:14:28.088 --> 01:14:28.964
- [Alex] Next door.

1619
01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.507
- [John] But where next door?

1620
01:14:30.507 --> 01:14:31.925
(thunder rumbling)

1621
01:14:31.925 --> 01:14:34.178
- [Alex] The spookiest basement
I've ever seen in my life!

1622
01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:35.679
- Exactly.

1623
01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:38.932
You enter a haunted house. you
cling to the ones you love.

1624
01:14:38.932 --> 01:14:42.436
It was all meant to bring
the family back together.

1625
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:44.605
And it worked.

1626
01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:47.774
On paper.

1627
01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:52.946
And I know what I did
was mostly inexcusable.

1628
01:14:56.492 --> 01:14:58.702
- Come on dad. I get it.

1629
01:14:58.702 --> 01:15:00.287
You want us back together

1630
01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:02.998
and you tried the only way
you knew how. with words.

1631
01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:05.792
(dreadful music)

1632
01:15:07.294 --> 01:15:09.296
- John. what are you doing here?

1633
01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:10.714
- Mom. you'd never understand.

1634
01:15:10.714 --> 01:15:11.507
- Try me.

1635
01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:13.050
- Dad loves you!

1636
01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:15.135
- Dad loves himself!

1637
01:15:15.135 --> 01:15:17.804
And I deserve better than that.

1638
01:15:17.804 --> 01:15:18.805
Excuse me.

1639
01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:20.807
- Something just dawned on me.

1640
01:15:20.807 --> 01:15:22.726
- Oh really. what's that?

1641
01:15:22.726 --> 01:15:24.645
- You'll never be good
enough for my father!

1642
01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:27.189
(stormy music)

1643
01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:44.831
(engine rumbling)

1644
01:15:44.831 --> 01:15:46.667
(heavy thudding)
(tires squealing)

1645
01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.669
Jess. that blasted bike.

1646
01:15:51.838 --> 01:15:54.091
(dreadful music)

1647
01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:56.260
(ticking)

1648
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.101
Mom. help!

1649
01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:05.852
- Alex. what's going on?

1650
01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:06.853
Oh dear Lord!

1651
01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:08.230
Someone call 911!

1652
01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:09.690
John!

1653
01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:10.524
Our little girl!

1654
01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:11.525
- Oh no. no no no!

1655
01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:13.402
- [Mom] She's been hit!

1656
01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:16.196
(dramatic music)

1657
01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:18.532
No. you're hurting her!

1658
01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:21.285
(sirens wailing)

1659
01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:30.544
What if it's her neck. her back?

1660
01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.215
- Get the first aid
kit under the sink.

1661
01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:38.260
- [Mom] Oh. you're hurting her!

1662
01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.096
(drawn-out music)

1663
01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:48.729
- That's for making
mom cry last night.

1664
01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:50.480
- I'm gonna make you
cry in two seconds!

1665
01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.567
(sad music)

1666
01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:57.070
(Alex sniffles)

1667
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.904
- [John] We'll have
to turn her over.

1668
01:16:57.904 --> 01:17:00.282
(torn music)

1669
01:17:15.088 --> 01:17:17.257
(ticking)

1670
01:17:22.262 --> 01:17:25.932
(moves into heavenly music)

1671
01:17:28.268 --> 01:17:31.271
(Jessica squealing)

1672
01:17:46.703 --> 01:17:49.373
(mom sniffling)

1673
01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:04.554
- This is a cat.

1674
01:18:04.554 --> 01:18:07.057
See his little
whiskers right there?

1675
01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:08.809
Look at his pointy ears.

1676
01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:11.144
Look at his fluffy little paws!

1677
01:18:11.144 --> 01:18:13.647
(aching music)

1678
01:18:18.985 --> 01:18:20.821
- [Christina Voiceover] A purse.

1679
01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:22.989
- [Alex Voiceover] Purse?

1680
01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:27.703
- Her purse lying
on the asphalt.

1681
01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:30.497
Something that I gave her
was sticking out of the top.

1682
01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:31.665
- What was it?

1683
01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:36.253
Here's something for you. kiddo.

1684
01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:40.340
- [Jessica Voiceover]
You know what?

1685
01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:41.717
- [Mom Voiceover] What?

1686
01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:42.843
- [Jessica Voiceover] I
don't think Alex really cares

1687
01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:44.094
anything about God.

1688
01:18:44.094 --> 01:18:47.180
(catastrophic music)

1689
01:18:50.183 --> 01:18:52.352
(wind chimes jingling)

1690
01:18:52.352 --> 01:18:53.186
- You got it. you got it.

1691
01:18:53.186 --> 01:18:54.563
Come on. baby.

1692
01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.897
- Come on. Jess.

1693
01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:57.566
Come on.

1694
01:18:59.359 --> 01:19:00.193
- Dear Lord.

1695
01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:02.237
I've tried it my way.

1696
01:19:03.864 --> 01:19:05.532
Now I trust in yours.

1697
01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:08.201
(soaring music)

1698
01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:19.129
(wind chimes clinking)

1699
01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:22.424
- Please.

1700
01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:24.885
- [John] Hey. hey.

1701
01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:26.136
- Hi. daddy.

1702
01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:28.054
- You did great.
pumpkin. (laughs)

1703
01:19:28.054 --> 01:19:30.307
Hey baby. how are you?

1704
01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:31.475
It's a miracle.

1705
01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:34.227
(resolute music)

1706
01:19:46.239 --> 01:19:48.992
(doorbell rings)

1707
01:19:52.996 --> 01:19:54.456
- I'm not good at
saying goodbye.

1708
01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.249
- [Christina] Let's
not say it then.

1709
01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.757
- You were the best thing that
happened to me this summer.

1710
01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:05.467
- That sounds like
a line from a movie.

1711
01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.761
- (laughs) Probably
is. but I mean it.

1712
01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:09.596
(cellphone dings)

1713
01:20:09.596 --> 01:20:10.430
Getting a text.

1714
01:20:12.432 --> 01:20:13.475
304-555-5232.

1715
01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:16.937
Somebody's phone number?

1716
01:20:16.937 --> 01:20:19.356
- Oh gee. what a coincidence.

1717
01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:20.524
- What's that?

1718
01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:22.192
- That phone number.

1719
01:20:22.192 --> 01:20:23.652
it's the same as mine.

1720
01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.153
(Christina laughs)

1721
01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:26.446
- [Willy] You're gonna
miss your flight. girl!

1722
01:20:26.446 --> 01:20:29.032
- Oh. I best be going.

1723
01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:31.451
- Oh hey. Christina.

1724
01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:32.953
I still got something of yours.

1725
01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.163
- What is it?

1726
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.626
The deal was for five days
and it's only been three.

1727
01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:40.669
- I know. Christina.

1728
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:41.628
Just look at it.

1729
01:20:41.628 --> 01:20:44.130
(proud music)

1730
01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:52.722
- Really?

1731
01:20:52.722 --> 01:20:54.140
- Really.

1732
01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:55.225
It was kind of tricky to open.

1733
01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:57.477
but I'm glad that I did.

1734
01:20:57.477 --> 01:20:59.646
Since I read it and
I did what it said.

1735
01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.147
guess I don't need it anymore.

1736
01:21:02.148 --> 01:21:03.316
He did something for me.

1737
01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.319
- You got saved.

1738
01:21:06.319 --> 01:21:08.029
- Yeah Christina. I got saved.

1739
01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:09.406
- He's kinda good like that.

1740
01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:12.242
- [Willy] You're gonna
miss your flight!

1741
01:21:13.827 --> 01:21:14.911
- I gotta go.

1742
01:21:14.911 --> 01:21:17.664
(resolute music)

1743
01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:24.004
- Daddy?

1744
01:21:24.004 --> 01:21:25.839
- What's that. sweet pea?

1745
01:21:25.839 --> 01:21:28.258
- Does your story
have a happy ending?

1746
01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:30.176
- Do you know sign language?

1747
01:21:30.176 --> 01:21:31.011
- What?

1748
01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:32.012
- Raise your thumb.

1749
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:35.348
Then raise your other thumb.

1750
01:21:35.348 --> 01:21:36.683
See that. sweetie?

1751
01:21:36.683 --> 01:21:38.184
That right there says it all.

1752
01:21:38.184 --> 01:21:41.187
(sentimental music)

1753
01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:45.692
- What's this?

1754
01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.361
- [John] Little advance
from my publisher.

1755
01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:51.197
(touching music)

1756
01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.703
Honey. are these glasses
too big for my face?

1757
01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:57.871
- No.

1758
01:21:57.871 --> 01:21:58.955
Why would you say
something like that?

1759
01:21:58.955 --> 01:22:00.540
- Maybe 'cause it's true.

1760
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:01.625
(Jessica laughs)

1761
01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.043
I can't wait to be home.

1762
01:22:03.043 --> 01:22:04.628
- Our real home.

1763
01:22:04.628 --> 01:22:06.379
- See. what's
better than family?

1764
01:22:06.379 --> 01:22:08.048
- [Alex] Family and a big house.

1765
01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:09.549
- Alex. what's wrong
with this house?

1766
01:22:09.549 --> 01:22:11.801
- Besides the size
and the smell.

1767
01:22:11.801 --> 01:22:13.094
I guess nothing really.

1768
01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:14.971
- Who needs a big house
when we have each other?

1769
01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.390
- (laughs) Yeah. Alex.

1770
01:22:18.892 --> 01:22:21.895
Maybe you and Christina can
have a big house someday.

1771
01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:24.397
- After the proper
ceremonies of course.

1772
01:22:24.397 --> 01:22:25.607
- Right.

1773
01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.233
Like she's ever
gonna remember me.

1774
01:22:27.233 --> 01:22:30.570
- Oh trust me. she will.

1775
01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:33.073
- That's right. nothing
but a stud muffin.

1776
01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:35.450
- (laughs) Yeah. and I
have the picture right here

1777
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.284
to prove it.

1778
01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:37.118
- Really?

1779
01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:37.953
Let me see it.

1780
01:22:41.247 --> 01:22:42.457
Jessica!

1781
01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:44.584
If you send it. I swear
I'll tear your ears off!

1782
01:22:44.584 --> 01:22:48.129
- Gee Alex. I can't
believe you don't trust me!

1783
01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:48.964
- Exactly!

1784
01:22:50.423 --> 01:22:52.008
- It's not like I'm gonna
push any old button and uh--

1785
01:22:52.008 --> 01:22:53.593
(beeping)

1786
01:22:53.593 --> 01:22:55.095
- [Alex] What?

1787
01:22:55.095 --> 01:22:56.846
You didn't do it. did you?

1788
01:22:56.846 --> 01:22:57.973
- Um.

1789
01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.849
- Jessica. say something
for Pete's sake!

1790
01:22:59.849 --> 01:23:01.309
- Okay.

1791
01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:02.477
Oops.

1792
01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:04.771
- Jessica!
