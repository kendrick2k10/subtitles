00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:10.218

4
00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:13.930
I know it'll be okay if I don't.
I saw a lot of people got rejected. so…

5
00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.224
I'm already on the page.
It says "status update."

6
00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:18.184
-[woman 2] "New update."
-I clicked it.

7
00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:19.811
Okay. status update.

8
00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:21.938
This is my ultimate dream school.

9
00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.898
I'm getting rejected. I already know.

10
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.111
I just clicked it. Oh. my God.

11
00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.572
[gasping]

12
00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:31.781
Oh. my God.

13
00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.158
Wait. I got accepted!

14
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.784
[screams]

15
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:35.952
Oh. my God!

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.539
-Yeah!

[all screaming and cheering]

19
00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:45.879
[woman 3] This is some crazy stuff.

20
00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:47.297
Let's talk about this.

21
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.634
There's been a firestorm of news coverage
on a sort of college admissions scandal.

22
00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.679
Explosive details
about the largest college admissions scam

23
00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.098
prosecuted by
the Department of Justice ever.

24
00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:01.770
Our friends are talking about one thing.
this story. It's hit a real nerve.

25
00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:06.483
[reporter 1] Real estate executives.
a lawyer. doctor and a litany of CEOs.

26
00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.651
all facing criminal charges.

27
00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.197
[reporter 2] An FBI investigation
called Operation Varsity Blues.

28
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.740
Operation Varsity Blues.

29
00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.658
Operation Varsity Blues.

30
00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.368
[reporter 3] How are you
after the scandal?

31
00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:20.455
-[reporter 4] Are you sorry?
-[reporter 5] Singer designed the scam

32
00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:22.582
and collected tens of millions of dollars.

33
00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:26.711
[reporter 6] Parents paid him top dollar
to pass their kids off as star athletes.

34
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.379
-[reporter 7] Rick Singer.
-Rick Singer.

35
00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:30.715
-[reporter 8] Rick Singer.
-[reporter 9] Rick Singer.

36
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.593
[reporter 11] The mastermind
behind the operation.

37
00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:36.221
[reporter 12] It is sending shockwaves
across the country.

38
00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:48.858
[alarm ringing]

39
00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.401
[tense music playing]

40
00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.417
[Singer on phone] The money goes
into my foundation as a donation.

41
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.420
[John Wilson on phone] To your foundation?
Not to the schools.

42
00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:12.132
[Singer] Yeah. that way the kids
don't know it happens. right?

43
00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.176
You make a financial commitment.

44
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.179
What school you want
may determine how much that actually is.

45
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.101
[Wilson] And so. in terms of things
that are more than half million or 300.

46
00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:25.061
what's that set of schools?

47
00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.606
[Singer] So that's. uh. Georgetown.
Boston College. Georgia Tech.

48
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.068
USC. UCLA. Berkeley. you know.

49
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.237
[Wilson] Okay. that's… that's not bad.

50
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.906
[Gordon Caplan]
She's not a terrific student.

51
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.449
She's been testing very badly.

52
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.536
[Michelle Janavs] She's smart.
She's gonna figure this out.

53
00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.164
She already thinks
I'm up to. like. no good.

54
00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.624
[Wilson] Uh. is Harvard easier
'cause of legacy?

55
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:47.917
[Singer] No. it's not.

56
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.379
-[Wilson] That doesn't mean shit?
-[Singer] Your legacy means zero because…

57
00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:54.215
[Wilson] Unless we're donating
to a building. huh?

58
00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.092
[Caplan] I went to Cornell.

59
00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:59.012
I've already given around $750.000 there.

60
00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:00.805
[Singer] Let's be frank. right?

61
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.391
Your 750 is diddly-dink in the world.

62
00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:06.769
I know people
who have given $50 million to Cornell.

63
00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:09.981
[Jane Buckingham] Uh. will you send me
where and how I should send the check?

64
00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:13.735
[Singer] Oh. yeah. We'll send it so that
you get your IRS tax write-off.

65
00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:16.070
-[Buckingham] Even better.
-[Wilson] What if they don't get in?

66
00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.865
[Singer chuckles] You don't have to worry.
It's a done deal.

67
00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:21.534
[Wilson] Is there a two-for-one
special for twins?

68
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.804
[Singer] John. how are you?

69
00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.599
[Wilson] Hey. Rick.
You're pretty busy these days. huh?

70
00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:47.060
Yeah. we got early decision coming up.

71
00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:55.235
So. hey. I do wanna talk a bit about
your pricing strategy and economic model.

72
00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:56.653
Uh…

73
00:03:56.736 --> 00:04:00.114
I don't wanna force it on you.
but I just think it could be helpful.

74
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.991
No. no. uh. yeah.

75
00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:10.708
I have a bunch of schools
that we work with directly

76
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.711
and. you know.
it's kind of a first come. first served.

77
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.506
So… pick a place you wanna go.

78
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.049
So. if you said Harvard

79
00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:21.010
or Princeton or Georgetown.
you know. one of those things.

80
00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:25.056
Well. if you wanna use my side door
at Harvard. it's about $1.2 million.

81
00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:25.974
Jesus.

82
00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:30.436
But if you wanna go through the back door.
Harvard's asking for $45 million.

83
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.855
-God.
-Stanford's asking for $50 million.

84
00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.440
-Wow.
-And they're getting it.

85
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:35.900
That's the crazy thing.

86
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.611
They're getting it
from the Bay Area and New York.

87
00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.155
John. this is how crazy it's gotten.

88
00:04:41.239 --> 00:04:44.284
I'm gonna do
over 730 of these side doors this year.

89
00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:45.285
[Wilson] Wow.

90
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:47.745
And how many schools
are you doing those at now?

91
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.039
Just like the top 20 or 50 or…

92
00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:52.375
[Robert Fisher] I've done a lot
of wiretaps over the years.

93
00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:55.420
It truly is amazing sometimes
what people will say on the phone

94
00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:58.131
when they don't know
that the feds are listening.

95
00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:00.883
I know. I know.
It's craziness. I know it is.

96
00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:04.470
Then I need you to get him into USC.
and then I need you to cure cancer.

97
00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.389
and. oh. make peace in the Middle East.

98
00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:07.515
I could do that.

99
00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:10.727
I could do that if you figure out a way
to boot your husband out

100
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.186
so that he treats you better.

101
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.480
[woman] That's impossible.
That is impossible.

102
00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.567
[Fisher] The government did a wiretap
on Rick's phone. He didn't know.

103
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.069
He was intercepted talking to many people.

104
00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:23.698
Every working mom comes to me
and says. "How do I do it all?"

105
00:05:23.781 --> 00:05:25.950
Well. guess what? You can't.

106
00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:30.830
There aren't many federal cases where
you have 50 people indicted for a crime.

107
00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:34.167
So we're trying to get ourselves.
like. a 34 on the ACT.

108
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.168
[woman] Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:37.295
[Singer] So Mark will do that.
Really could be a 33.

110
00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:40.173
-Could be a 34. Could be a 35.
-[woman] Right.

111
00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.008
[Singer] Can you get me
a handwriting sample?

112
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:44.093
-[woman] Yep.
-And a signature sample.

113
00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.804
-So we can get kinda close.
-[woman] Yes.

114
00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.891
[Daniel Golden] Rick Singer was
the independent counselor

115
00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:53.728
who orchestrated the wrongdoing
in Operation Varsity Blues.

116
00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:58.191
and the court documents
indicate that it started in 2011.

117
00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:01.694
My own research
into Singer's life and career

118
00:06:01.778 --> 00:06:04.447
indicates that. on a smaller scale.

119
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.825
he was deceptive for decades before that.

120
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.208
[Margie Amott] I'd like to think
Rick started out

121
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.753
trying to be professional
and trying to be legitimate.

122
00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:21.672
For a number of years.
Rick was the go-to person.

123
00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:24.550
He was the only one in town
who did this sort of thing.

124
00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:27.970
If you wanted information about
college admissions. you went to Rick.

125
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.848
I think people were eager to use him.
They were excited.

126
00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:34.560
They were impressed and thought.
"Wow. he knows the formula."

127
00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:37.855
"He knows the rules.
He has the key to the game."

128
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:42.485
[Akil Bello] If you're a well-to-do parent
in a school with 500 seniors.

129
00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:46.364
your child is getting a fraction
of the attention you want them to get.

130
00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:49.700
So you do what you do.
You apply money to the problem.

131
00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.954
You find somebody who will
independently help just your child.

132
00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:54.956
and help them through this process.

133
00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.709
And that's sort of the genesis
of an independent college counselor.

134
00:07:01.254 --> 00:07:04.549
My parents said. "We're hiring
an independent college counselor

135
00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:08.261
who can help give you
a little guidance on SAT prep.

136
00:07:08.344 --> 00:07:12.432
and help narrow your focus
for the colleges you're interested in."

137
00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:14.851
"He'll be a presence in your life

138
00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:18.146
for the foreseeable future.
until college applications are in."

139
00:07:19.063 --> 00:07:21.691
[Golden] I believe there were
many students he worked with

140
00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:23.860
who had very good credentials.

141
00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:27.238
and he performed
the normal services of a counselor

142
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:29.365
and facilitated their admission to college

143
00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.327
by advising them on their essays
or their recommendations and so on.

144
00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:36.205
He was the go-to
college counselor at that time.

145
00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.374
Back then. there weren't many resources.

146
00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:43.504
He had this company called Future Stars.
I had many friends that used him.

147
00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.923
It was one of those things
where you had to do it.

148
00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:48.468
If you didn't.
you'd regret it and worry about.

149
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:52.638
"Did I get into where I wanted to go?
Could I have gotten in if I'd used him?"

150
00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:57.018
He always dressed like he had
just come from the basketball court.

151
00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:59.604
[Patricia Fels] His idea was that
what he was doing was

152
00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:02.190
coaching kids for getting into college.

153
00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.484
so therefore he dressed like a coach.

154
00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.278
[Amott] He used to walk around
in his athletic clothes.

155
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.905
and his little monk hairdo.

156
00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.740
He wasn't necessarily charismatic.

157
00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:13.326
Didn't crack a lot of smiles.
Was pretty serious.

158
00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:16.078
Very shrewd. Businesslike.

159
00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:19.040
He didn't chat much.
He wasn't very personable.

160
00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:23.503
There are people you meet who feel
like they have this vibrating tension

161
00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:27.048
right under the surface
all the time. and he was like that.

162
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.053
[Amott] Rick was always
drumming up business.

163
00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:36.599
He was always giving presentations
at Borders. at the country clubs.

164
00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:39.060
And I also knew
what his presentations entailed.

165
00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:41.729
and they were promises
that he couldn't keep and…

166
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.356
lies.

167
00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:47.360
[Fels] I would hear some stories
from kids that made me think

168
00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:49.946
that he was a little bit fishy.

169
00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:51.864
A little bit slimy.

170
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:57.495
I have one acquaintance
who said that Rick started offering him.

171
00:08:57.578 --> 00:09:00.540
"Hey. I could potentially
get you into this school

172
00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.500
for a certain amount of money."

173
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.377
[talking indistinctly]

174
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.087
[Golden] Almost from the beginning.

175
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.173
Rick Singer was cutting corners.
at least in a small way.

176
00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:12.343
The word I got from people
who knew him in Sacramento

177
00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:16.305
was he was exaggerating and fabricating
on kids' applications.

178
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.559
You know.
changing their race from white to Latino

179
00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:23.104
or African American so that they
could qualify for affirmative action.

180
00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:24.897
I mean. he was quite brazen.

181
00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:29.402
Because I was always suspicious
of Rick Singer. I started to keep a file.

182
00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.904
I started copying things off his website.

183
00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:35.449
"The Singer Group has developed
into one of the US's most successful

184
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:38.077
life coaching and consulting businesses."

185
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.080
"Within a year. operations
launched in Singapore. Bangkok.

186
00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:43.374
Philippines. China. Japan and Korea."

187
00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:46.627
Rick Singer was frequently telling lies
about his resume.

188
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:51.132
Somebody told me that he pretended
he'd been a board member of Starbucks.

189
00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.218
The more he got away with it.
the more he did it.

190
00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:02.184
[reporter 1] We're still on
the preliminary part of the case.

191
00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:05.563
But both indictments brought against him
were incredibly detailed.

192
00:10:05.646 --> 00:10:06.606
[cell phone rings]

193
00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.442
-There appears to be a lot of evidence…
-Yeah.

194
00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:12.361
[Singer on phone]
Is this Gordon Gekko of Wall Street?

195
00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:16.574
No. it's Gordon Caplan. How are you?

196
00:10:16.657 --> 00:10:18.826
I'm just kidding with you. How you doing?

197
00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:20.161
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

198
00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:23.247
[reporter 2] Corporate deal lawyer
Gordon Caplan.

199
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.125
a partner at the law firm
of Willkie Farr & Gallagher.

200
00:10:27.084 --> 00:10:30.463
[Caplan] The US tax system
has two fundamental components

201
00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:33.507
which makes this somewhat alluring.

202
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:37.386
My wife has told me
a little bit about what you guys do.

203
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.390
Uh. could… could you just
give me a little bit of background?

204
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:43.476
[Singer] Okay. So. who we are.

205
00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:48.481
We are a $290 million company that I own.

206
00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:53.027
with a thousand employees
across the US. 280 internationally.

207
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:57.114
We help the wealthiest families
in the US get their kids into school.

208
00:10:57.198 --> 00:11:00.534
We have every NBA owner. every NFL owner.

209
00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:02.161
We've got everybody.

210
00:11:02.244 --> 00:11:05.581
Now. these families. they want guarantees.

211
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.541
They don't wanna be messing around.

212
00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:11.253
They want this thing done.
So they want in at certain schools.

213
00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.632
So I've done 761.
what I would call. "side doors."

214
00:11:14.715 --> 00:11:17.051
The "front door"
means getting in on your own.

215
00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:21.305
The "back door" is making a donation.
which is ten times as much money.

216
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:23.641
I've created this kind of side door in

217
00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:26.560
because with the back door.
there's no guarantee.

218
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.854
They're just gonna give you a second look.

219
00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:31.982
My families want a guarantee.

220
00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:38.864
[officer] I'm a special agent
with the FBI.

221
00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:42.660
I'm currently part of a squad
that investigates economic crimes.

222
00:11:42.743 --> 00:11:47.123
including various forms of corporate
fraud. securities fraud and bribery.

223
00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:50.292
The facts in this affidavit
come from my personal involvement

224
00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.128
with this investigation.

225
00:11:52.795 --> 00:11:55.756
Hi. my name is Rick Singer.
and I'm the founder of The Key.

226
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.843
[officer] Rick Singer founded
and operated The Key.

227
00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:02.054
a for-profit college counseling
and preparation business.

228
00:12:02.138 --> 00:12:04.807
He also founded
The Key Worldwide Foundation.

229
00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:09.812
a non-profit corporation that
is exempt from paying federal income tax.

230
00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:14.066
Rick Singer told parents that he could
facilitate their children's admission

231
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.901
via what he termed "the side door."

232
00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:20.656
a special arrangement in which the parents
would make a donation to his foundation

233
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.160
to conceal the fact
that they were bribe payments.

234
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.539
Between approximately 2011 and 2018.

235
00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:31.584
parents paid Singer
approximately $25 million

236
00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:34.628
to bribe coaches
and university administrators.

237
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.632
This is America. Like. you got money?

238
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:42.970
Best believe you have access to
certain spaces that other kids don't have.

239
00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:45.306
So I'm… I'm really not surprised…

240
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:47.558
[Jon Reider] Over the last
three or four decades.

241
00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:51.812
higher education
has become increasingly a commodity.

242
00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:55.065
Something that you purchase. A product.

243
00:12:55.149 --> 00:13:00.404
It's a goal in and of itself. rather than
the goal being to get an education.

244
00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.948
It's become a status point.

245
00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:05.868
Your status has now increased

246
00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:09.663
because your child is at
what's called an "elite institution."

247
00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:11.916
It's all about bragging rights.

248
00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:16.128
The running line in our industry is like.
"The parents are applying to college."

249
00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:19.507
"The kid is the vehicle
through which they apply to college."

250
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.175
If you're a freshman. I'm sorry.

251
00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:25.596
because you are gonna be thrown
into a world where they're gonna be like.

252
00:13:25.679 --> 00:13:27.431
"College. college. college."

253
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.642
"Go to college.
You have to get the best grades."

254
00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:33.687
"If you're not. you're gonna feel
like a failure. You're the worst."

255
00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.315
If you're a parent
and you didn't go to Harvard.

256
00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:40.110
this is your chance to now
go to Harvard. right? In your warped mind.

257
00:13:42.112 --> 00:13:45.783
[Bello] It's typically accepted
that Ivy League institutions

258
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:48.619
are the "best" in the country.

259
00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:53.707
But all of those differences
have almost nothing to do

260
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:57.002
with the academics of the institution.

261
00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:00.840
U.S. News started
ranking colleges in the '80s.

262
00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.801
based on one criteria: prestige.

263
00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:05.719
That's it. [chuckles] That's it.

264
00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:08.305
"Prestige" is actually a French word.

265
00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:12.726
In the original French.
it means something people don't realize.

266
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.311
It means "deceit."

267
00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:16.772
That's what prestige is in the college.

268
00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:20.442
It's imaginary. It's an illusion.
Yet people believe in it.

269
00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.778
It's not just population growth

270
00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.489
that makes it harder
to get into colleges today.

271
00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:28.158
The colleges themselves
have brought it about.

272
00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:31.996
Because the more selective they look
on paper. the higher ranked they are.

273
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:36.208
Everything these schools are doing is
massaging to try and up the rankings.

274
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.252
And it's a really dangerous game.

275
00:14:38.961 --> 00:14:41.213
[Golden] Most people
see college admissions.

276
00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:45.134
"Oh. it's based on merit except for
affirmative action for minorities."

277
00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:49.638
My view of the admissions process
is all sorts of different preferences.

278
00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:52.641
with. yes. some students
getting in on pure merit.

279
00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:56.896
but many others getting in due to
preferences that skew rich and white.

280
00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:02.109
One is by preferences
for students who play niche sports.

281
00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:05.905
like sailing or fencing
or horseback riding.

282
00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:08.532
which most kids never get a chance to try.

283
00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:11.869
Then there's making
a huge donation to a university.

284
00:15:11.952 --> 00:15:14.705
That gets them noticed
by the fundraising office.

285
00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:17.625
which will recommend
the candidate to admissions.

286
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:21.879
Jared Kushner was the son
of a very wealthy real estate developer

287
00:15:21.962 --> 00:15:23.047
in New Jersey.

288
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.966
At the time Jared was applying to college.

289
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:29.136
his father pledged
$2.5 million to Harvard.

290
00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:31.347
and Jared was admitted to Harvard.

291
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.266
even though by all accounts
he was an average student

292
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.853
who wasn't necessarily taking
the toughest courses in his high school.

293
00:15:38.604 --> 00:15:41.398
A lot of the colleges
won't actually guarantee the admission.

294
00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:42.733
which is interesting.

295
00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:46.320
So you might write a check for $3 million.
and the kid could be rejected.

296
00:15:46.403 --> 00:15:49.198
If you're not writing
a $10 to $20 million dollar check.

297
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.408
it doesn't move
the needle enough for them.

298
00:15:52.618 --> 00:15:56.455
[Golden] Singer didn't demand
the kind of money that is required today

299
00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:59.500
if you want to absolutely guarantee
your kid's gonna get in.

300
00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:04.964
You know. these parents paid Singer
$300.000. $400.000. $500.000.

301
00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:07.007
What he sold and what they bought

302
00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:11.512
was essentially a certainty of admission
at a bargain basement price.

303
00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:14.848
So I'm gonna make him a kicker.

304
00:16:14.932 --> 00:16:17.810
He does have strong legs.
Maybe he'll become a kicker.

305
00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:19.728
-You never know.
-Yeah. Absolutely.

306
00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:21.313
You could inspire him. Rick.

307
00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:23.816
You may actually turn him
into something. I love it.

308
00:16:23.899 --> 00:16:25.818
[chuckles] Yeah. I know.

309
00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:28.612
-Bill McGlashan. good to see you.
-Nice to be here.

310
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:32.032
TPG Growth is a firm
people don't know that much about.

311
00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:34.827
[reporter] TPG Growth
is the $4 billion growth arm

312
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.663
of the private equity giant TPG Capital.

313
00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:41.375
The more successful the business is.
the more impact you're creating.

314
00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:45.796
You get the virtuous benefits of
sustainable. scalable capitalism at work.

315
00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:49.591
[Singer] Last year I had a boy.
I made him a long snapper.

316
00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:50.509
I love it.

317
00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:54.013
He was 145 pounds. Long snapper.

318
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.348
[chuckles] So what I'll probably need is.

319
00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:59.309
if you guys have any pictures
of him playing multiple sports.

320
00:16:59.393 --> 00:17:02.771
that will be helpful. because I will
photoshop his face onto a kicker.

321
00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:05.983
[chuckling] Okay. Okay. let me
look through what I have.

322
00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:09.361
Pretty funny the way the world
works these days. it's…

323
00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:10.946
unbelievable.

324
00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:21.582
[reporter] Devin Sloane. he's a
California businessman. an executive.

325
00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:24.168
We've had the good fortune of knowing you

326
00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:27.504
and sharing smiles
and joy and laughter together.

327
00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:35.512
[Singer] Last year. I had a boy
who did the water polo.

328
00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:38.766
When the dad sent me the picture.
he was too high out of the water.

329
00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:41.226
Nobody would believe
anybody could get that high.

330
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.352
[McGlashan] Yeah.

331
00:17:42.436 --> 00:17:43.979
[Singer] So I told the dad. I said.

332
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:46.940
"What happened?" He said.
"He was standing on the bottom."

333
00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:49.526
I said. "No. no. no. no. no."

334
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.279
Yeah. exactly.
You gotta be swimming. Exactly.

335
00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:54.531
-That's right.
-Now. does he…

336
00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:57.618
Here's the only question.
Does he… Does he know?

337
00:17:57.701 --> 00:18:01.997
Is there a way to do it in a way
where he doesn't know what happened?

338
00:18:02.081 --> 00:18:06.001
Well. what I would say to him.
if you wanna have that discussion now.

339
00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.879
is say we have friends in athletics
who are going to help him.

340
00:18:08.962 --> 00:18:10.464
Because he is an athlete.

341
00:18:10.547 --> 00:18:14.134
But I can't say that in front of my son
'cause he knows he's not.

342
00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:16.887
What he would know is
that I'm going to take his stuff

343
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.597
and get him some help. okay?

344
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.349
That he would have no issue with.

345
00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:23.602
you lobbying for him.
you helping use your network.

346
00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:27.189
-No issue.
-You don't have to tell him a thing.

347
00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:29.608
[Agustin Huneeus] Is Bill McGlashan
doing any of this shit?

348
00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:31.860
Is he just talking a clean game
and helping his kid?

349
00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.695
-He makes me feel guilty.
-[Singer] Um…

350
00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:37.199
Or you taking care of him
because you have other interests with him?

351
00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:40.410
No. No. not at all.
It has nothing to do with his--

352
00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:43.163
But he didn't know. His kid had no idea.

353
00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.624
He didn't have any idea
you helped him on the ACT.

354
00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:47.751
-That's what he asked for.
-Bill McGlashan?

355
00:18:47.835 --> 00:18:49.628
Asked for his son not knowing.

356
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:51.213
-Okay.
-All right.

357
00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:53.882
-So he's not been as forthcoming.
-With me?

358
00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:55.926
With you and with his own kid.

359
00:18:56.552 --> 00:18:57.803
He wants it that way.

360
00:18:58.762 --> 00:18:59.847
[Singer] Your guy Agustin?

361
00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.306
[McGlashan] Agustin Huneeus. yeah.

362
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.810
He's pushing hard. trying to find out
your guys' approach with your son.

363
00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:06.937
He came to me. and I said I did not…

364
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.523
I was not willing to talk to him about it.

365
00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:10.941
He's been pushing me. too.

366
00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:14.153
He obviously wants to get your help.
you know. with his daughter.

367
00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:18.157
and I just said. "You need to
make your own call what you wanna do.

368
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.702
and you just need to talk
to Rick and work with Rick."

369
00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:22.911
No. that's good.

370
00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:26.081
He's pushing hard. Like.
"You gotta tell me what they're doing."

371
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:30.210
I said. "Listen. this is their situation.
and Bill is very connected.

372
00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:33.213
You need to discuss this with Bill.
not discuss it with me."

373
00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:35.382
Well. he tried that. He tried that.

374
00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:38.677
Just so you know. he sort of
had a conversation with another family

375
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.514
about the side door approach
you have and was sort of suggesting.

376
00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:45.350
"Do you think this is right?"
And I just said.

377
00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:48.145
"Agustin. you shouldn't be
talking about this.

378
00:19:48.228 --> 00:19:51.356
What Rick does
is very specific to circumstances."

379
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.693
And it just bothered me
he's out there talking about it.

380
00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:56.737
Agreed. Agreed. Yeah. And that's…

381
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.780
And that's what worries me. too.

382
00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:02.492
I said. "Listen. you are in
a very competitive environment."

383
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:05.037
"You have to keep what you do
to yourself.

384
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.496
It will blow up on you.

385
00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.874
No matter who you think you know.
it doesn't matter."

386
00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:11.460
That's right.
and he's not discreet at all.

387
00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:14.171
That's why I wasn't comfortable
talking to him about it.

388
00:20:14.254 --> 00:20:15.631
-Good.
-Right.

389
00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:19.718
Rick Singer provided reassurance.

390
00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:23.263
The reassurance
that other people just like you

391
00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:25.515
are going through this thing.

392
00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:27.935
"I've dealt with this a million times."

393
00:20:28.018 --> 00:20:31.730
Rick was like a therapist or a life coach.

394
00:20:31.813 --> 00:20:34.149
only he was also a criminal.

395
00:20:34.858 --> 00:20:38.654
[Justin Paperny] My profile of Rick Singer
is he's a born salesman.

396
00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:40.656
He was smooth and subtle.

397
00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.367
not overbearing.
and knew that he had time.

398
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.661
It's not like someone
has to get into school today.

399
00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:48.372
It's not like the test is tomorrow.
They have time.

400
00:20:48.455 --> 00:20:51.875
So he nurtured the process well.
like a good salesman does.

401
00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:54.378
So what sport would be the best for them?

402
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:57.673
Is… is crew the best?
Is that even gonna really matter?

403
00:20:57.756 --> 00:20:59.258
For me. it doesn't matter.

404
00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:02.261
I'll make him a sailor or something
because of where you live.

405
00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:06.348
[reporter] Massachusetts businessman
John Wilson.

406
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.267
He runs a private equity firm.

407
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.769
He's accused of paying
more than a million dollars

408
00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:13.814
to try to get his kids
into elite universities.

409
00:21:13.897 --> 00:21:17.359
And same kinda deal? Any sport?
You don't have to play the sport?

410
00:21:17.442 --> 00:21:18.694
[Singer] That's correct.

411
00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:23.532
Now. um… what if
they don't actually get in?

412
00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:26.785
[chuckles] You don't have to
worry about it. It's a done deal.

413
00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:28.787
Okay. That's great.

414
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:32.249
Okay. I'll send you the information
about the bank and the wiring stuff

415
00:21:32.332 --> 00:21:33.667
in the next day or so.

416
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.584
All right.

417
00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:37.462
Oh. by the way.
mark your calendar for next July

418
00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:39.756
if you want in on. uh. Paris.

419
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.509
-Got a big birthday July 19.
-Okay.

420
00:21:42.592 --> 00:21:45.262
-I rented out Versailles.
-[chuckles] Oh. my God!

421
00:21:45.345 --> 00:21:46.638
You're crazy.

422
00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:50.142
I know. A black tie party there.
so you'll have to come.

423
00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:55.314
One of the amazing things
about Rick Singer is that this guy.

424
00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:59.401
from a kind of obscure background
and without a lot to show on paper.

425
00:21:59.484 --> 00:22:02.612
insinuated himself
into quite a high social circle.

426
00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:05.115
and made an awful lot of money doing it.

427
00:22:07.617 --> 00:22:11.163
My sense was that Rick Singer
had a somewhat unhappy childhood.

428
00:22:11.246 --> 00:22:13.582
His parents divorced when he was young.

429
00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:17.294
He was bright. He had
the gift of the gab unquestionably.

430
00:22:17.377 --> 00:22:20.005
After childhood.
he went to several colleges.

431
00:22:20.088 --> 00:22:21.965
After that. he went into coaching.

432
00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:26.845
But his problem was he was too volatile.
particularly as a high school coach.

433
00:22:26.928 --> 00:22:30.140
He tended to scream at the players
if something went wrong.

434
00:22:30.223 --> 00:22:32.893
Kind of like the Bobby Knight
of high school coaching.

435
00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:36.271
When Sacramento State had a bad year.
they went 4 and 24 one year.

436
00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:39.733
the whole coaching staff was fired.
and that included Singer.

437
00:22:39.816 --> 00:22:42.069
That's when he looked around and he said.

438
00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:45.113
"Maybe basketball coaching
isn't for me after all.

439
00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.865
I've gotta switch careers."

440
00:22:46.948 --> 00:22:51.578
And he noticed this new industry
of independent college advisors.

441
00:22:51.661 --> 00:22:54.164
and he became the first one in Sacramento.

442
00:22:55.832 --> 00:23:00.462
It's interesting how his background.
in a way. prepared him for this scandal.

443
00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:03.673
If you think about it.
as a basketball coach in college.

444
00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:07.469
he had firsthand exposure
to how athletic admissions worked.

445
00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:11.431
and that was knowledge
that undoubtedly he put to use years later

446
00:23:11.515 --> 00:23:16.103
in his efforts to bribe coaches to portray
kids falsely as recruited athletes.

447
00:23:16.186 --> 00:23:18.855
He knew
athletic admissions from the inside.

448
00:23:19.356 --> 00:23:20.982
[Singer] Hey. John. How are ya?

449
00:23:21.066 --> 00:23:22.901
Hey. Rick. I'm okay.

450
00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:25.570
I'm here
in a big rainstorm in Saudi Arabia.

451
00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:27.656
-[Singer] Saudi Arabia?
-[Wilson] Yeah. I'm in Dubai.

452
00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:30.617
[Singer] I didn't know they had
storms like that out there.

453
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.328
[Wilson] Yeah. I know. Very unusual.
What's happening?

454
00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:37.249
So I just gave the Stanford sailing coach
$160.000 for his program.

455
00:23:37.332 --> 00:23:39.668
While we were
having that conversation. I said.

456
00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:42.462
"Hey. I'm hoping that this
160 I'm helping you with

457
00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:44.297
helps secure a spot for next year."

458
00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:47.968
"Can I be guaranteed
a spot for next year?" And he said yes.

459
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:49.928
-All it takes?
-No.

460
00:23:50.011 --> 00:23:52.556
-No. that's not all it takes.
-[scoffs] Yeah. okay.

461
00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:55.892
This is not TJ Maxx
or Marshalls or something like that.

462
00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:58.478
-Right.
-So I want you to have first dibs.

463
00:23:58.562 --> 00:24:01.148
If you want. I can provide
John Vandemoer with a check.

464
00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:05.444
I can send him your $500.000
to secure a spot for one of your girls.

465
00:24:06.778 --> 00:24:10.740
John Vandemoer. he was
kind of lured out to Stanford.

466
00:24:10.824 --> 00:24:14.786
He was a successful
sailing coach on the East Coast.

467
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.163
My name is John Vandemoer.

468
00:24:16.246 --> 00:24:20.083
I am the head coach
of the Stanford University sailing team…

469
00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:23.670
By all accounts.
he seemed like a good. upstanding guy.

470
00:24:23.753 --> 00:24:26.673
There were a lot of people
that were surprised. who knew him.

471
00:24:26.756 --> 00:24:29.009
that he got caught up in this.

472
00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:31.636
[man 1] SF1. take eight. soft sticks.

473
00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:34.764
[man 2] Audio good?

474
00:24:34.848 --> 00:24:37.434
[man 3] Almost clear. All clear.
Thank you.

475
00:24:37.517 --> 00:24:38.435
[man 2] Okay.

476
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:41.980
Did you ever
imagine yourself in this situation

477
00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:43.732
before any of this happened?

478
00:24:43.815 --> 00:24:48.028
Never. It's a lot. It's something
I don't think I've fully comprehended yet.

479
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:49.279
Um…

480
00:24:49.362 --> 00:24:52.282
But it's something
that'll impact the rest of my life.

481
00:24:56.077 --> 00:24:59.122
I first got connected
with Rick Singer through a phone call.

482
00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:00.707
He called me one day.

483
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.877
he introduced himself.
said he was a college recruiter.

484
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.588
and was interested in doing more
with smaller sports.

485
00:25:07.422 --> 00:25:11.218
So I thought it was intriguing and agreed
to meet with him the next morning.

486
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:15.263
What I thought was interesting is that
I was expecting him to text me or call me

487
00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:16.765
when he got to Stanford.

488
00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:19.017
Because Stanford has… It's very secure.

489
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.687
You have to have a keycard to kind of
swipe in and out of every door.

490
00:25:22.771 --> 00:25:24.981
And somehow he just showed up at my door.

491
00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:27.484
I was shocked by that.
but it definitely told me

492
00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:30.612
he had connections with Stanford
that were deeper than myself.

493
00:25:31.613 --> 00:25:36.159
Rick Singer is kind of your
California beach bum. in a way.

494
00:25:36.243 --> 00:25:38.411
Flip-flops. T-shirt. shorts.

495
00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:42.666
He was actually really easy to talk to.
I had really good conversations with him.

496
00:25:42.749 --> 00:25:45.794
He was really engaging and drawing me in.

497
00:25:45.877 --> 00:25:48.964
Our interaction
was solely about recruiting.

498
00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:51.383
The way recruiting works at Stanford is

499
00:25:51.466 --> 00:25:55.637
each sport is given a certain amount
of spots that you can support.

500
00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:00.600
He kinda ended with him talking about
this young woman named Molly Zhao.

501
00:26:00.684 --> 00:26:06.147
Hello. everyone. I am. um. 17 now.
I've just graduated from high school.

502
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:09.192
[Vandemoer] Rick said that
she really wanted to go to Stanford.

503
00:26:09.276 --> 00:26:11.403
My recruiting was pretty much
done at that point.

504
00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:15.740
So I wasn't considering her for a spot
I could support. and I had told Rick that.

505
00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:18.910
He contacted me
almost right away and was like.

506
00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:21.162
"Is there any other way
you could support?"

507
00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:22.706
"Her family is pretty wealthy."

508
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:25.875
"They'd be interested
in donating about a million dollars."

509
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:29.754
My athletic director said that
it's something Stanford could do.

510
00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:34.634
but that a million dollars wasn't enough
to really have an impact with admissions.

511
00:26:34.718 --> 00:26:38.722
So that was it. And I didn't hear
anything from Rick for a while.

512
00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:41.683
In August of that next year.

513
00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:46.104
Rick called me up out of the blue
and said. "Hey. this is fantastic."

514
00:26:46.187 --> 00:26:49.232
"Molly got in. the family's so excited.
Thanks for all you did."

515
00:26:49.316 --> 00:26:51.192
I said. "Great. I'm excited for her."

516
00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:55.322
"It's a big deal to get into Stanford.
But I didn't really do anything."

517
00:26:55.405 --> 00:27:00.493
He said. "Well. they're really excited and
wanna donate $500.000 to your program."

518
00:27:00.577 --> 00:27:05.040
I said. "If they wanna donate $500.000 to
the sailing program for me doing nothing.

519
00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:07.000
that sounds great to me."

520
00:27:07.542 --> 00:27:12.213
I see no evidence that John did do
anything to get Molly Zhao into Stanford.

521
00:27:12.964 --> 00:27:17.719
Why did Rick Singer donate
$500.000 in the name of Molly Zhao?

522
00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:19.888
Only Rick knows the answer to that.

523
00:27:19.971 --> 00:27:22.349
It may have been a huge down payment

524
00:27:22.432 --> 00:27:24.684
for access
to the Stanford sailing program.

525
00:27:25.268 --> 00:27:28.438
[Vandemoer] He sent the check. I got it
in the mail at my campus mailbox.

526
00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:31.983
and I went in to Development
and told my athletic director

527
00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:34.361
I'd gotten this $500.000 donation.

528
00:27:34.444 --> 00:27:36.738
She was excited for me.
We talked about how

529
00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:39.407
I hadn't done anything for it.
it was out of the blue.

530
00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:42.285
But. you know. I guess
that's the best kind of donation.

531
00:27:42.869 --> 00:27:46.790
At the same time. the head athletic
director for Stanford was there. as well.

532
00:27:46.873 --> 00:27:49.376
and said congratulations.
was excited about it.

533
00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:52.420
I started to explain.
"Hey. it's through this guy. Rick Singer."

534
00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:55.757
He turned to me. interrupted me
and said. "Oh. I know Rick."

535
00:27:57.676 --> 00:28:01.721
[Billy Witz] I think what we see here
is school administration officials

536
00:28:01.805 --> 00:28:03.390
want to keep the money coming in.

537
00:28:03.473 --> 00:28:06.226
They don't wanna ask questions
of how it got there.

538
00:28:06.309 --> 00:28:09.562
And I think we definitely
saw this in the case of Stanford.

539
00:28:09.646 --> 00:28:13.942
When you'd have
$100. $200. $500.000 donations

540
00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:16.903
that would come in
for something like sailing.

541
00:28:16.986 --> 00:28:21.157
that that wouldn't raise any red flags
or wouldn't be scrutinized.

542
00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:25.787
It seems as if Singer
targeted sports that were under the radar

543
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.623
because the margins are tighter.

544
00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:31.042
He knew the right places to look.

545
00:28:36.506 --> 00:28:39.384
So I've got two kids
at Stanford and two kids at Yale.

546
00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:41.678
I'm trying to find out
who's stepping up first.

547
00:28:41.761 --> 00:28:42.929
[Rudy Meredith] Okay.

548
00:28:43.012 --> 00:28:45.724
Don't matter. 'Cause
I might have a spot for both of 'em.

549
00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:47.225
-Really?
-Maybe.

550
00:28:47.308 --> 00:28:53.064
[reporter] Yale soccer coach Rudy Meredith
pocketing more than $860.000 in bribes.

551
00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:56.735
[Meredith] You can come in an Ivy League
environment and develop as a player

552
00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:58.903
and still have your Yale degree.

553
00:28:58.987 --> 00:29:00.822
Give me… Give me the names.

554
00:29:00.905 --> 00:29:02.031
I'm working on it.

555
00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:04.993
I got a new athletic director
is what I'm trying to tell you.

556
00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:06.411
I'm trying to work it.

557
00:29:06.494 --> 00:29:08.538
Hold on one sec. Let me just. uh…

558
00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:13.084
You know. I have no idea
where the hell I am here in London.

559
00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:14.544
Mm-hmm. No problem.

560
00:29:14.627 --> 00:29:17.964
Frickin' hate these
one-way street bullshit things.

561
00:29:18.047 --> 00:29:21.176
I know. And you're on the left side
of the road. Be careful.

562
00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:25.013
Yeah. tell me about it.
Now I'm. uh. at two-three.

563
00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:26.681
Where's four-five?

564
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.058
Where the fuck is it?

565
00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:31.770
Now I'm on the main street again.

566
00:29:31.853 --> 00:29:34.397
I tell you what.
I'm glad I live in the US.

567
00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:36.941
[Meredith laughs] It wouldn't be bad
if you were in Sweden.

568
00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:40.153
[Singer] Then I gotta
find myself a good Swedish girl. then.

569
00:29:40.236 --> 00:29:43.531
[Meredith] All right. Next time
I'm in Sweden. I'll take a look.

570
00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:46.409
Tell me what you're looking for.
I'll see what I can do.

571
00:29:46.493 --> 00:29:49.162
Yeah. Well. I'll tell you this much.

572
00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:52.373
At my age.
it's hard to find the right people.

573
00:29:53.249 --> 00:29:54.751
That's the hardest thing.

574
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:04.469
[Patricia Logan] I met Rick through
my very first time on a dating site.

575
00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:08.097
I'd never been
on a dating site before in my life.

576
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.684
And. at 53 years old
at the time. I figured.

577
00:30:11.768 --> 00:30:14.187
"All right. It's… Let me give it a try."

578
00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:17.816
There he was. and there I was.
and he messaged me. and…

579
00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:19.859
[clicks tongue] it went from there.

580
00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:24.322
When I met him. did I look him up online?
Of course. Right away.

581
00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:26.658
And I thought. "Wow. this guy is…"

582
00:30:26.741 --> 00:30:29.869
Other than
the poor video quality on his website.

583
00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:32.997
I thought.
"This is very interesting. what he does."

584
00:30:33.081 --> 00:30:37.085
My key method unlocks
the full potential of your son or daughter

585
00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:39.796
and sets them
on a course to excel in life.

586
00:30:39.879 --> 00:30:41.756
I thought. "He's really a go-getter."

587
00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.467
"He's really out there
doing something good."

588
00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:49.180
I met him out for dinner.
It was interesting.

589
00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:52.517
when we first started
comparing notes about our pasts.

590
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:57.230
and we both
started working the very same time.

591
00:30:57.313 --> 00:31:00.525
He was 12 and I was 12. [chuckles]

592
00:31:00.608 --> 00:31:01.860
I had a paper route.

593
00:31:01.943 --> 00:31:06.781
and he was the kid
that got the older kids to buy alcohol.

594
00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:10.869
sell to him.
he'd sell it then for a profit to kids.

595
00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:12.871
So I said. "Okay. I had a paper route.

596
00:31:12.954 --> 00:31:15.665
you're a minor
selling booze to minors. Great."

597
00:31:15.748 --> 00:31:18.251
He goes. "Yeah.
I was very industrious." [chuckles]

598
00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:20.962
So we laughed about that.
And he was charismatic.

599
00:31:21.045 --> 00:31:23.548
He was… interesting.

600
00:31:23.631 --> 00:31:25.216
He was smart.

601
00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.720
It was quick. It was like.
"Nice to meet you. Great. Good night.

602
00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:33.516
I really like you. When I find time.
let's go out again." [laughs]

603
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.977
-[man] Was he pretty serious?
-Oh. super serious.

604
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.981
One time I sent him an emoji.
the Bitmoji. I said. "Hi."

605
00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:44.277
And he came back with. "You're crazy.
Stay cool in school."

606
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.320
Little goofy.

607
00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:48.948
His own family said.
you know. I made him laugh.

608
00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:51.200
[laughs] He needed to laugh more.

609
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:52.869
He was not. uh…

610
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:56.623
wanting to stick around long.

611
00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:01.586
He was just so very busy
with college coaching. house to house.

612
00:32:02.837 --> 00:32:05.006
[Golden] Another characteristic
of Singer's

613
00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:07.258
was that. you know. he worked nonstop.

614
00:32:07.342 --> 00:32:10.053
From what his former assistants told me.

615
00:32:10.136 --> 00:32:12.221
he wouldn't spend the night at a hotel.

616
00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:14.098
He'd spend it on an airplane.

617
00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:18.686
And he would be. you know. texting
his assistants at all hours of the day.

618
00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.521
giving them various tasks.

619
00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:23.358
He was an extremely driven guy.

620
00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:26.736
[Logan] I got the sense
he had clients all over the place.

621
00:32:26.819 --> 00:32:30.490
I look back on text messages.
and every time we connect. he says.

622
00:32:30.573 --> 00:32:35.244
"I'm in Dallas. I'm in Fort Lauderdale.
I'm in New York. Back to California."

623
00:32:35.328 --> 00:32:38.665
He even lived out of a van
at times when he was coaching.

624
00:32:38.748 --> 00:32:40.917
He had this big Mercedes-type van thing.

625
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.544
He'd sleep in it
'cause it was just easier.

626
00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:44.879
[alarm beeping]

627
00:32:45.713 --> 00:32:49.759
[Logan] Rick had a passion for just
getting up every morning. 4:00 a.m..

628
00:32:50.343 --> 00:32:53.805
working out. swimming. cycling. running.

629
00:32:53.888 --> 00:32:55.932
That man was like the Energizer Bunny.

630
00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:59.602
I've never seen anybody
that would just have so much energy

631
00:32:59.686 --> 00:33:00.895
and go. go. go.

632
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:05.608
I think he lived on about three hours
of sleep a night. from my understanding.

633
00:33:05.692 --> 00:33:07.110
And that was fine with him.

634
00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:11.614
I looked at
a lot of his behaviors and realized.

635
00:33:12.198 --> 00:33:14.200
you know. he was hiding a lot.

636
00:33:14.867 --> 00:33:18.830
He had been leading
and living this secret life.

637
00:33:18.913 --> 00:33:21.624
No wonder why
he couldn't get close to people.

638
00:33:23.918 --> 00:33:25.712
-[Huneeus] Hey. Rick?
-[Singer] Hey there.

639
00:33:25.795 --> 00:33:28.047
-Is this a good time?
-Yeah. It's good for me.

640
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:28.965
Okay. great.

641
00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:32.176
My name is Agustin Huneeus.

642
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.095
We're sitting in one of the pavilions.

643
00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:37.265
enjoying a beautiful afternoon
at Quintessa in Napa.

644
00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:40.143
And so let's go and taste.

645
00:33:40.226 --> 00:33:44.272
Just walk me through the whole kind of
water polo thing again and how it works.

646
00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:48.401
You and I talked about the economics.
timing and how all that works.

647
00:33:48.484 --> 00:33:52.405
You and I had a brief conversation
about it. but I want to get it straight.

648
00:33:52.488 --> 00:33:54.157
Okay. Okay.

649
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.909
I'm putting together
your daughter's sports profile now.

650
00:33:56.993 --> 00:33:59.203
It'll be a water polo profile now.

651
00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:01.664
I take her transcript.
test scores and profile

652
00:34:01.748 --> 00:34:04.042
to the liaison for all sports at USC.

653
00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:06.627
Football… Everybody has to go through her.

654
00:34:09.255 --> 00:34:13.342
[Heinel] My name's Donna Heinel. and I am
a senior associate athletic director.

655
00:34:13.426 --> 00:34:14.302
I have the…

656
00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:18.890
[Witz] By all accounts. Donna Heinel
was a very diligent supervisor

657
00:34:18.973 --> 00:34:22.268
who was really a stickler for details.

658
00:34:22.351 --> 00:34:24.604
She was also getting
20 grand a month from Singer.

659
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:28.524
And then she…
They have meetings every other Thursday.

660
00:34:28.608 --> 00:34:30.526
which are called subcommittee meetings.

661
00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:34.989
where the dean of admissions and two
admissions staff go through the athletes.

662
00:34:35.073 --> 00:34:37.992
It could be water polo
this week. football next week.

663
00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:39.327
It could be basketball.

664
00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:42.997
It depends on where they are
in the seasons and what's going on.

665
00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:44.957
Heinel became the gatekeeper

666
00:34:45.041 --> 00:34:48.920
between the admissions department
and the athletic department.

667
00:34:49.003 --> 00:34:54.133
Because the idea was for the students
to be treated as recruited athletes.

668
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:56.719
that's virtually a guarantee of admission.

669
00:34:56.803 --> 00:35:01.182
Some of the fake athletes at USC.
it seems like it would be hard to miss.

670
00:35:01.265 --> 00:35:04.268
I mean. there was
a 5'5" men's basketball player.

671
00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:08.397
A high school cheerleader
was made to look like a lacrosse player.

672
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:12.110
There was a water polo player
who didn't play water polo in high school.

673
00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:15.905
It's pretty remarkable that
none of these things raised a red flag.

674
00:35:15.988 --> 00:35:18.533
And on the rare occasion when they did.

675
00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:22.578
Heinel was there to smooth them over
with the admissions department.

676
00:35:22.662 --> 00:35:26.916
[Singer] Your daughter will get presented.
and if the committee says."She's in."

677
00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:30.670
then what happens is
Donna tells me she's in. we're good.

678
00:35:30.753 --> 00:35:33.589
Essentially. she's been admitted
before she even applied.

679
00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:37.343
At that point. you will send
your $200.000 check to our foundation.

680
00:35:37.426 --> 00:35:42.515
Then Jovan will call me and say. "Okay.
this is how I want the money split."

681
00:35:42.598 --> 00:35:45.476
You understand my daughter's
not worthy to be on that team.

682
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.311
No. no. he's my guy.

683
00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:50.481
and he knows she's not
coming to play. He knows all that.

684
00:35:51.899 --> 00:35:55.528
There were four USC employees
that were involved with Rick Singer.

685
00:35:55.611 --> 00:35:59.323
One of them was Jovan Vavic.
the water polo coach.

686
00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:04.370
Vavic is by far the most successful
coach in college water polo.

687
00:36:04.453 --> 00:36:09.167
Vavic has been charged by authorities
of accepting more than $250.000

688
00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:14.797
in exchange for helping two students
get into USC as water polo players.

689
00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:27.018
[Singer] Donna Heinel essentially puts
them on the recruited walk-on list.

690
00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:28.436
which happens all the time.

691
00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:32.273
And they just don't show up
for practice. and that's fine.

692
00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:34.859
One of the things Singer took advantage of

693
00:36:34.942 --> 00:36:38.487
was the fact that athletic departments
and admissions offices

694
00:36:38.571 --> 00:36:40.239
both take a coach's word

695
00:36:40.323 --> 00:36:43.451
for the athletic caliber
of the person they're recruiting.

696
00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:46.662
Is there any risk
that this thing blows up in my face?

697
00:36:46.746 --> 00:36:48.706
[Singer] It hasn't in 24 years.

698
00:36:48.789 --> 00:36:51.709
No. I know all that. but the environment…

699
00:36:51.792 --> 00:36:53.461
Like. some article comes out

700
00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:57.423
that the polo team is selling seats
into the school for 250 grand.

701
00:36:57.506 --> 00:37:00.468
Well. no.
because she's a water polo player.

702
00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:02.803
But she's not.

703
00:37:04.513 --> 00:37:05.973
[Chloe] I'm so scared.

704
00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:09.810
[woman] Check it. No matter what happens.
you're gonna be fine.

705
00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:13.022
-[man] You have to face it.
-[woman] You have to face it. Yeah.

706
00:37:13.105 --> 00:37:16.275
-You're gonna be fine. I promise.
-I got deferred.

707
00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:18.194
[woman] You got deferred?

708
00:37:18.277 --> 00:37:19.403
[sobs]

709
00:37:20.238 --> 00:37:22.573
There's an update
in your application portal.

710
00:37:22.657 --> 00:37:25.117
you click on it.
and then that letter pops up.

711
00:37:25.201 --> 00:37:29.330
"We appreciate your passion for
our school. We're sorry to inform you…"

712
00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:32.416
"…we are unable to
offer you admission to Stanford."

713
00:37:35.544 --> 00:37:36.754
[sobbing]

714
00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:42.510
I'm not getting into San Diego or UCLA.

715
00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.387
Just makes me feel like shit.

716
00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:48.557
I literally started bawling.
Like. it just angered me.

717
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:52.645
There were a lot of tears.
punching the wall. cursing.

718
00:37:52.728 --> 00:37:55.856
I didn't leave my room.
I was crying the entire weekend.

719
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:57.608
I got rejected.

720
00:38:01.904 --> 00:38:05.283
[Priscilla Sands] I have seen a change.
and I have seen a progression.

721
00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:10.288
And I do think that students
are more obsessed with college.

722
00:38:10.371 --> 00:38:14.667
I'd say most kids are getting plagued
by this anxiety. and you can feel it.

723
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.003
They're freaking out
when you meet with them.

724
00:38:17.086 --> 00:38:20.089
They're like. "What if this happens?"
"What about that?"

725
00:38:20.172 --> 00:38:23.426
"Will they not like me
because I wrote this one word?"

726
00:38:23.509 --> 00:38:26.304
It's like they're losing their minds
because of it.

727
00:38:26.387 --> 00:38:30.182
Basically. I got rejected by
almost all of the colleges I applied to.

728
00:38:30.266 --> 00:38:34.020
It's awful because
you think something's wrong with yourself.

729
00:38:34.103 --> 00:38:37.606
When we have children and they apply
to colleges. where will they go?

730
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.817
No one's getting into colleges
at that point.

731
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.696
It's crazy. Like. USC's acceptance rate
just went down three more percent.

732
00:38:43.779 --> 00:38:46.115
It's at 12% now. which is like…

733
00:38:46.198 --> 00:38:49.243
Most students who wanna go
to college could find a college.

734
00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:51.495
The problem is

735
00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:55.249
far too many students
want to go to the same colleges.

736
00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:58.753
My goals were Ivy League.
I wanted to get in that.

737
00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:02.006
And when I didn't get in.
I was… just broken.

738
00:39:02.089 --> 00:39:05.926
I took AP bio. I'm taking
AP environmental science this year. I…

739
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.304
I'm not interested in it at all.

740
00:39:08.387 --> 00:39:11.932
Just to have this
extra leverage that doesn't even help.

741
00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:15.311
[Barbara Kalmus] This is going on
in high schools across the country.

742
00:39:15.394 --> 00:39:17.355
How many advanced classes can you take?

743
00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:20.399
You drop orchestra
because if you don't do orchestra.

744
00:39:20.483 --> 00:39:22.234
you can take another science class.

745
00:39:22.318 --> 00:39:24.653
There's so much pressure on these kids.

746
00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:28.240
Because if a school offers
15 APs and you've only taken one.

747
00:39:28.324 --> 00:39:31.035
you can cross off
the top 50 schools in the country.

748
00:39:31.118 --> 00:39:35.414
You have people who just
go home and all they do is homework.

749
00:39:35.498 --> 00:39:39.293
I hate seeing
how it consumes people's lives.

750
00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:42.171
I think social media
is a contributing factor.

751
00:39:42.254 --> 00:39:46.759
because as soon as
a student anywhere has an acceptance.

752
00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:49.095
it goes onto social media.

753
00:39:49.178 --> 00:39:53.349
so it's just another time
to sort of feel a punch in the gut.

754
00:39:53.432 --> 00:39:56.519
It's just really shitty to feel like this.

755
00:39:56.602 --> 00:40:00.022
And I know that people
that got in are super deserving.

756
00:40:02.149 --> 00:40:06.487
I like to curl my fake lash
with my real lashes.

757
00:40:07.071 --> 00:40:10.991
[Fry] Olivia Jade is an extremely
successful YouTube influencer.

758
00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:14.954
She had millions of followers
watch these videos where she would.

759
00:40:15.037 --> 00:40:18.874
you know. get up. brush her teeth.
do her morning makeup routine.

760
00:40:18.958 --> 00:40:20.709
pick out outfits.

761
00:40:20.793 --> 00:40:22.795
So it's this very diary-like thing.

762
00:40:22.878 --> 00:40:26.465
but with the added benefit
of branding opportunities.

763
00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:29.718
I created my own collection
with Princess Polly.

764
00:40:29.802 --> 00:40:31.720
I get to reveal and announce

765
00:40:31.804 --> 00:40:35.599
my highlight palette
with Sephora Collection.

766
00:40:37.852 --> 00:40:41.021
[Fry] She's the child
of the actress Lori Loughlin

767
00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:44.525
and the fashion designer
Mossimo Giannulli.

768
00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:49.113
They supposedly had both of
their daughters. Olivia Jade and Bella.

769
00:40:49.196 --> 00:40:52.908
pose on a rowing machine.
and sent these pictures to Rick Singer

770
00:40:52.992 --> 00:40:57.079
and had them accepted
into USC as coxswains.

771
00:40:57.163 --> 00:41:01.083
I went to high school with Olivia Jade.
I know the school she was at.

772
00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:06.130
I saw a picture of Olivia Jade's sister
on the wall with the seniors.

773
00:41:06.213 --> 00:41:09.842
and it was like.
"Congratulations for getting into USC."

774
00:41:09.925 --> 00:41:14.805
And then I remember hearing later
that Olivia had also gotten into USC.

775
00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:18.434
I was like. "Whoa."
'Cause USC is extremely hard to get into.

776
00:41:18.517 --> 00:41:21.187
So not only one sister. but both of them.

777
00:41:22.104 --> 00:41:23.272
Off to school.

778
00:41:23.355 --> 00:41:25.149
[Loughlin] Bye. Olivia. Have a lovely day.

779
00:41:25.232 --> 00:41:28.319
-I know you're so excited.
-I won't. I will not.

780
00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:32.615
Whatever.

781
00:41:34.617 --> 00:41:36.327
[Naomi Fry] There's an Olivia Jade video

782
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.747
where it's the first day
of her senior year of high school.

783
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.041
and she's pretty miserable.

784
00:41:42.124 --> 00:41:44.043
I've gone to one class. and I wanna die.

785
00:41:44.126 --> 00:41:46.420
It's so hot in every single room.

786
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:48.589
I just wanna go home.

787
00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:52.009
Then she returns home
and she says. "I've never been so happy."

788
00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:55.429
I've never been so happy
to be anywhere in my whole entire life.

789
00:41:55.513 --> 00:42:00.559
Then there's also a nod to a kind of.
like. you know. #blessed.

790
00:42:00.643 --> 00:42:02.937
Remember how lucky
we are to have an education

791
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.773
and how many people
would kill to have a good education.

792
00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:09.693
Or an education at all.
So. as much as I hate it…

793
00:42:11.237 --> 00:42:14.823
I still hate it. but I'm grateful
that I get to be educated.

794
00:42:14.907 --> 00:42:16.242
Even though I hate it.

795
00:42:16.325 --> 00:42:19.995
Olivia Jade had said that
she wanted to drop out of high school.

796
00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:21.872
in fact. when she was a senior.

797
00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:26.293
I told my mom I wanted to quit school.
She was like. "That's not happening."

798
00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:30.005
She made me stick it out.
and then my dad made me go to college.

799
00:42:30.089 --> 00:42:34.385
Mostly my parents really wanted me to go.
because both of them didn't go to college…

800
00:42:34.468 --> 00:42:36.303
-They did all right.
-[Olivia] They did fine.

801
00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.638
-They did fine.
-[Olivia] Yeah.

802
00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.348
-[man] They are--
-Hypocrites.

803
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.851
[Fry] It never seemed
like she was very interested

804
00:42:42.935 --> 00:42:44.436
in what college could give her.

805
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.606
Why should she be? She was
very successful in what she was doing.

806
00:42:48.315 --> 00:42:50.025
Things were going great for her.

807
00:42:53.946 --> 00:42:55.864
[Fry] In November of 2017.

808
00:42:55.948 --> 00:43:00.411
Donna Heinel presented Olivia Jade's
athletic profile to the USC subcommittee.

809
00:43:00.494 --> 00:43:03.581
and they approved her admission
to the university conditionally.

810
00:43:05.457 --> 00:43:06.875
Less than two weeks later.

811
00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:10.462
Rick Singer wrote an email
confirming to Olivia's parents

812
00:43:10.546 --> 00:43:12.923
that she was going to be accepted at USC

813
00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:15.384
and told them
to keep it hush-hush until March.

814
00:43:19.638 --> 00:43:23.726
The guidance counselor at Olivia Jade's
high school became suspicious

815
00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:27.813
because he didn't believe either
of the sisters participated in crew.

816
00:43:28.564 --> 00:43:31.650
According to the government.
Olivia Jade and her parents

817
00:43:31.734 --> 00:43:34.111
discussed how to avoid the possibility

818
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:38.198
of the high school counselor
disrupting their admissions scheme.

819
00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:42.161
Olivia Jade asked whether she should
list USC as her top choice school

820
00:43:42.244 --> 00:43:46.081
and Lori replied. "Yes. but it might be
a flag for the weasel to meddle."

821
00:43:46.165 --> 00:43:48.208
Presumably referring to the counselor.

822
00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:53.631
And Mossimo added to that. "Fuck him."
and said that he was a "nosy bastard."

823
00:43:55.424 --> 00:43:58.802
Things began to unravel
when Olivia Jade's counselor

824
00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:01.680
had a phone call
with a USC admissions official.

825
00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:05.225
[man] Conducted routine
counselor call with USC

826
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:08.228
to check up
on the dozens of applicants that year.

827
00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:09.772
When we got to Olivia.

828
00:44:09.855 --> 00:44:13.400
USC said she was flagged
as a recruit for the crew team.

829
00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:17.237
I told them I had no knowledge
of Olivia's involvement in crew.

830
00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:19.948
Based on what I knew
of her video blogging schedule.

831
00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:22.368
I highly doubted
she was involved in the sport.

832
00:44:22.451 --> 00:44:26.997
[Fry] Somehow Mossimo found out
what the counselor had said to USC.

833
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:29.166
and went to the school to confront him.

834
00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:31.502
[telephone ringing]

835
00:44:31.585 --> 00:44:33.629
[man] I received a call
from the front desk

836
00:44:33.712 --> 00:44:37.257
that Mr. Giannulli was downstairs
and wanted to talk to me.

837
00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:39.635
When we sat down in my office.

838
00:44:39.718 --> 00:44:43.430
he aggressively asked
what I was telling USC about his daughters

839
00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:48.060
and why I was trying to ruin
or get in the way of their opportunities.

840
00:44:48.143 --> 00:44:50.562
His tone made me visibly nervous.

841
00:44:51.563 --> 00:44:55.693
[Fry] Word of the confrontation
got back to Donna Heinel at USC.

842
00:44:55.776 --> 00:44:59.738
and she left a voicemail for Rick Singer
cautioning about the situation.

843
00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:03.826
[Heinel] Yeah. hey. Rick. look.
I just wanna make sure that.

844
00:45:03.909 --> 00:45:07.204
you know. I don't want the…
the parents getting angry

845
00:45:07.287 --> 00:45:10.624
or creating any type
of disturbance at the school. okay?

846
00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:13.502
I just wanna make sure
that those students.

847
00:45:13.585 --> 00:45:16.964
if questioned at the school.
that they respond appropriately.

848
00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:20.050
that they're walk-on candidates
for their respective sports.

849
00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:22.469
that they're looking forward
to trying out for the team

850
00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:24.555
and making the team when they get here.

851
00:45:24.638 --> 00:45:27.099
That's what I just… wanna make sure of.

852
00:45:27.182 --> 00:45:29.601
I don't want anybody
walking into their high school

853
00:45:29.685 --> 00:45:31.562
and. you know. yelling at counselors.

854
00:45:31.645 --> 00:45:33.605
That'll shut everything down.

855
00:45:35.357 --> 00:45:38.068
[Golden] The scandal did surprise me

856
00:45:38.152 --> 00:45:42.030
because it reflected
a kind of blatant illegality.

857
00:45:42.114 --> 00:45:46.243
Bribing college coaches to pretend
that their children were athletes

858
00:45:46.326 --> 00:45:47.703
when in fact they weren't.

859
00:45:47.786 --> 00:45:51.749
Why would a college coach
jeopardize their job and their reputation

860
00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:54.251
to let somebody in for a bribe?

861
00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.507
[Vandemoer] Fundraising was
certainly a big part of my job.

862
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:03.135
Funding going to the football
and basketball programs

863
00:46:03.218 --> 00:46:07.514
are pretty extreme compared to
what a smaller sport like sailing gets.

864
00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.934
The school isn't making money
by having a sailing program.

865
00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:14.646
It's great they offer it for students.
but that program is in the red.

866
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:17.357
That money has to be either
made up for in donations

867
00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:21.445
or the school is just writing a check
for salaries. equipment. travel.

868
00:46:22.237 --> 00:46:24.615
[Vandemoer] My dream would be
if my job was just to coach.

869
00:46:24.698 --> 00:46:26.784
All told. I was horrible at fundraising.

870
00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:28.994
It's not something I really like to do.

871
00:46:29.077 --> 00:46:30.662
But it was done out of necessity.

872
00:46:31.497 --> 00:46:34.208
It was always
a struggle to kind of survive.

873
00:46:36.043 --> 00:46:40.464
In December 2018. all the head coaches
are gonna meet with the senior staff.

874
00:46:40.547 --> 00:46:42.007
It's a big deal. that meeting.

875
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.469
In 11 years. I'd met the senior
athletic director a handful of times.

876
00:46:45.552 --> 00:46:49.306
I'm in the athletic director's office.
There's. like. six of them there.

877
00:46:49.389 --> 00:46:52.559
We'd just won a national championship
less than a month earlier.

878
00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:55.437
and the athletic director
hadn't even recognized it.

879
00:46:55.521 --> 00:46:58.649
Didn't say congratulations.
didn't reach out to the team. nothing.

880
00:46:58.732 --> 00:47:01.151
Didn't say congratulations
during that meeting.

881
00:47:01.235 --> 00:47:03.487
The only thing
he was doing was watching TV.

882
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:06.824
He was facing. you know.
four or five screens on a wall

883
00:47:06.907 --> 00:47:08.784
and was watching basketball.

884
00:47:08.867 --> 00:47:12.579
The only time he looks up at me
and starts really asking questions

885
00:47:12.663 --> 00:47:14.414
is when it comes to fundraising.

886
00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:16.917
Like. "You're doing a great job
of fundraising."

887
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.836
"Keep that up. That's really helpful."

888
00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:22.256
Then he goes back to the television.
That's it for the whole meeting.

889
00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:24.258
[man] This is someone
that knew Rick Singer.

890
00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.885
Yes. Yeah. he told me he did.

891
00:47:31.139 --> 00:47:34.935
Rick really was pushing me hard
to really take a look at this student.

892
00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:38.564
He was really interested and knew
I wanted a second assistant coach.

893
00:47:38.647 --> 00:47:41.775
and I was struggling
to fundraise for that position.

894
00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:44.152
and he said. "Hey. through my foundation.

895
00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:48.115
I would like to donate
$110.000 to the program

896
00:47:48.198 --> 00:47:51.785
to get you through
a year or two of funding that position."

897
00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:53.912
He's like. "No strings attached."

898
00:47:53.996 --> 00:47:57.499
"I just wanna continue our relationship
and keep bringing people to you

899
00:47:57.583 --> 00:47:59.209
and have you look at 'em."

900
00:47:59.293 --> 00:48:01.253
I said. "Great. That's fantastic."

901
00:48:01.837 --> 00:48:03.922
[Fisher] I think this was
a slippery slope for John.

902
00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:06.884
and he didn't knowingly wake up and say.

903
00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:11.346
"You know what? Today I'm going to
join this racketeering conspiracy."

904
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:14.516
But all the government have to prove is
"Did you accept the money

905
00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.478
in exchange for something
that the giver of the money wanted

906
00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:20.439
and didn't duly earn. didn't deserve?"

907
00:48:20.522 --> 00:48:24.484
The biggest factor
in the Stanford coach's case

908
00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:26.653
was he didn't personally enrich himself.

909
00:48:27.404 --> 00:48:31.450
The proceeds that he received
furthered the sailing program at Stanford.

910
00:48:32.034 --> 00:48:34.953
Rick Singer was skilled
at leveraging off people.

911
00:48:35.037 --> 00:48:37.497
He had a sixth sense to exploit

912
00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:40.375
and find vulnerabilities
of people he was working with.

913
00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:43.712
From my understanding.
in the Felicity Huffman case.

914
00:48:43.795 --> 00:48:45.005
he told Felicity.

915
00:48:45.088 --> 00:48:48.300
"Your daughter's scores aren't good enough
to get into this school."

916
00:48:48.383 --> 00:48:50.052
Turns out that was made up. false.

917
00:48:50.135 --> 00:48:52.429
The daughter
would've gotten in regardless.

918
00:48:52.512 --> 00:48:54.890
It's identifying those pain points.

919
00:48:54.973 --> 00:48:57.142
Felicity can begin to rationalize.

920
00:48:57.225 --> 00:49:00.604
"Am I a good enough mother?
Have I spent too much time on my career?"

921
00:49:00.687 --> 00:49:02.981
"Don't you want
your daughter in a good school?"

922
00:49:03.065 --> 00:49:05.233
Leveraging off the weakness.
the pain point.

923
00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:10.197
No. his grades
are not good enough to get into SC.

924
00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.449
-[McGlashan] Is that right?
-Oh. yeah. Oh. yeah.

925
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.660
That's amazing.

926
00:49:14.743 --> 00:49:16.828
Wow. Okay.

927
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:19.665
What would her chances be
without this process?

928
00:49:19.748 --> 00:49:21.249
-[Singer] Zero.
-She won't get in?

929
00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:23.168
Zero. She has no chance.

930
00:49:23.835 --> 00:49:26.755
What he did well.
like what a good marketer does.

931
00:49:26.838 --> 00:49:28.048
he sold the benefits.

932
00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:29.132
It's very simple.

933
00:49:29.216 --> 00:49:31.802
"Would you like
your daughter to go to Harvard?" "Yes."

934
00:49:31.885 --> 00:49:34.930
"Great. If you'd like
your daughter to go to Harvard. do this.

935
00:49:35.013 --> 00:49:37.849
Here's the reality.
Your daughter's not scoring that well.

936
00:49:37.933 --> 00:49:39.726
been mentoring her for two years.

937
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.396
The kid doesn't get it.
If she's not Harvard material.

938
00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:45.774
and you want her to go to Harvard.
we gotta take a different path.

939
00:49:45.857 --> 00:49:48.735
Here's that path.
We'll have someone take the test for you."

940
00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:49.945
"What do you mean?"

941
00:49:50.028 --> 00:49:53.281
"This guy. for $15.000.
is gonna take the test."

942
00:49:54.032 --> 00:49:55.492
This is absolutely unheard of.

943
00:49:55.575 --> 00:49:57.953
To make this happen.
I can make scores happen.

944
00:49:58.036 --> 00:50:00.330
and nobody on the planet
can make scores happen.

945
00:50:00.414 --> 00:50:04.042
Your kid won't even know it happened.
It will happen as though…

946
00:50:04.126 --> 00:50:07.587
She will think she's really super smart
and she got lucky on a test.

947
00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:08.964
and you got a score now.

948
00:50:09.047 --> 00:50:11.049
It's the homerun of homeruns.

949
00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:13.093
-And it works?
-[Singer] Every time.

950
00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:14.136
[both chuckle]

951
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.722
What is the… What is the number?

952
00:50:17.472 --> 00:50:20.017
The number on the testing
is $75.000. okay?

953
00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:24.563
It's $75.000 to get any scores
you wanna get on the ACT or SAT.

954
00:50:25.063 --> 00:50:28.275
If you wanna get into
an elite university in America.

955
00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:31.903
on the ACT. which is scored out of 36.

956
00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:35.866
if you're not
really in the 34. 35. 36 range.

957
00:50:35.949 --> 00:50:40.662
or on the SAT if you're not
sort of 1500 and above.

958
00:50:40.746 --> 00:50:43.081
you're probably not in the conversation.

959
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:47.294
[Reider] For many years.
the SAT was explained

960
00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:50.005
and advertised as being an aptitude test.

961
00:50:50.088 --> 00:50:54.843
A very prominent. predictive feature
of getting a high test score…

962
00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:57.387
is family income.

963
00:50:57.471 --> 00:51:01.266
The college board and the ACT
have admitted this for years.

964
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:03.769
This is not a secret
that's being divulged.

965
00:51:03.852 --> 00:51:07.189
If I were appointed czar
of American college admissions.

966
00:51:07.272 --> 00:51:09.066
I would abolish standardized testing.

967
00:51:09.649 --> 00:51:13.528
It would mean that all of these
wealthy test prep companies

968
00:51:13.612 --> 00:51:15.906
would have to find something else to do.

969
00:51:15.989 --> 00:51:20.744
Register your son or daughter for
the Princeton Review's 1500+ course.

970
00:51:20.827 --> 00:51:22.370
It's a game-changer.

971
00:51:22.454 --> 00:51:25.999
There's a fair warning around
test preparation. This is a business.

972
00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:28.335
Every claim they make is marketing driven.

973
00:51:28.835 --> 00:51:33.924
We even offer a guaranteed score
improvement of at least 150 points.

974
00:51:34.007 --> 00:51:37.010
So you have people out there
who are making claims like.

975
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:40.097
"We'll improve your score 500 points."

976
00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.140
That's worth $1.000 investment.

977
00:51:42.766 --> 00:51:47.562
But it's only worth $1.000 investment if
you have a disposable $1.000 to invest.

978
00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:49.898
[Reider] All standardized testing

979
00:51:49.981 --> 00:51:53.985
automatically advantages
the people who are already advantaged.

980
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:57.239
Most affluent people
are accessing people like me.

981
00:51:57.322 --> 00:52:01.743
and 85% of America
just can't access that level of expertise.

982
00:52:01.827 --> 00:52:04.371
A private college counselor's
gonna run you.

983
00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:06.206
on the low. low. low end.

984
00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:10.210
and you're not getting a quality
college counselor. 200. 300 bucks an hour.

985
00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:14.589
On the high end. you're talking
about $500 to over $1.500 an hour

986
00:52:14.673 --> 00:52:18.927
to access these guys and gals.
and it's a lot.

987
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.847
-Hello?
-[woman] Hi. Dad.

988
00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:25.725
[Bello] When you look at it
in light of the scandal.

989
00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:28.019
when you have predominantly rich families

990
00:52:28.103 --> 00:52:32.023
who had every advantage
that said they should be fine on the SAT.

991
00:52:32.107 --> 00:52:34.317
they're gonna score
in the highest demographic.

992
00:52:34.401 --> 00:52:38.697
they had all the prep in the world
that they wanted. and yet they still…

993
00:52:39.281 --> 00:52:40.115
cheated.

994
00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:45.036
Okay. the first thing we need to do.
and I think I mentioned this to your wife.

995
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.081
we need to get your daughter
tested for a learning difference.

996
00:52:48.165 --> 00:52:51.710
Let's say it's my person who does it.
or whoever you wanna do it.

997
00:52:51.793 --> 00:52:56.047
I need that person to get her
100% extended time over multiple days.

998
00:52:57.174 --> 00:53:01.261
[Bello] When you take the SAT
or the ACT. it's a timed test. Right?

999
00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:03.513
There are restrictions
on how it's delivered.

1000
00:53:03.597 --> 00:53:08.310
To account for learning disabilities.
often accommodations are provided.

1001
00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:11.271
You have to have
certain medical documentation

1002
00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:13.565
of the need for these accommodations.

1003
00:53:13.648 --> 00:53:17.694
And that's one of the avenues
that Rick Singer exploited.

1004
00:53:17.777 --> 00:53:20.906
I also need to tell your daughter.
that when she takes the test.

1005
00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:22.115
to not be as…

1006
00:53:22.407 --> 00:53:23.700
To be stupid.

1007
00:53:23.783 --> 00:53:25.619
To not be as smart as she is.

1008
00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:27.913
The goal is to be slow.

1009
00:53:27.996 --> 00:53:30.832
to not be as bright as she is. all that.

1010
00:53:30.916 --> 00:53:33.210
so that we show discrepancies.

1011
00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:36.796
At the academy.
kids are getting extra time all the time.

1012
00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.840
-[Caplan] You mean the Greenwich Academy?
-Yeah.

1013
00:53:38.924 --> 00:53:40.550
Everywhere in the country.

1014
00:53:40.634 --> 00:53:43.762
What happened is.
all the wealthy families figured out.

1015
00:53:43.845 --> 00:53:46.806
"If I get my kid tested
and they get extended time.

1016
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.642
they can do better on the test."

1017
00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:52.229
Most of these kids don't have issues.
But they're getting extra time.

1018
00:53:52.312 --> 00:53:54.147
The playing field's not fair.

1019
00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:55.315
No. it's not.

1020
00:53:55.982 --> 00:53:57.442
I mean. this is… I…

1021
00:53:57.525 --> 00:53:59.611
To be honest.
it feels a little weird. but--

1022
00:53:59.694 --> 00:54:01.988
I know it does. I know it does.

1023
00:54:02.072 --> 00:54:06.451
But when she gets a score and we have
choices. you're gonna be saying.

1024
00:54:06.534 --> 00:54:09.913
"Okay. I'll take all my kids.
We're gonna do the same thing."

1025
00:54:09.996 --> 00:54:13.250
And a score of…
You would think that would be…

1026
00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:15.835
[Singer] The score will be
whatever we want it to be.

1027
00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:19.631
So. again. and keep in mind I am a lawyer.

1028
00:54:19.714 --> 00:54:21.675
so I'm sort of rules-oriented.

1029
00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:26.638
Doing this with you. no way…
She's taking the test. It's…

1030
00:54:26.721 --> 00:54:30.392
It's her taking the test. right?
There's no way any trouble comes of this?

1031
00:54:30.475 --> 00:54:31.601
Nothing like that?

1032
00:54:31.685 --> 00:54:33.186
So. I. uh…

1033
00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:36.356
I explained this to you before.

1034
00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:38.024
[Caplan] I… I know.

1035
00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:41.194
-And I apologize. but it's just--
-[Singer] No. I get you.

1036
00:54:41.278 --> 00:54:42.821
-Bear with me.
-[Singer] Okay.

1037
00:54:43.405 --> 00:54:45.407
I will explain to you the process.

1038
00:54:46.408 --> 00:54:49.577
You're going to fly to LA
and go on a fake recruiting visit.

1039
00:54:50.203 --> 00:54:52.580
You'll visit some schools
while you're out here.

1040
00:54:52.664 --> 00:54:55.917
Then what'll happen is Mark.
who is the proctor. will fly in.

1041
00:54:56.001 --> 00:54:59.004
and he'll show up on Friday night.
just like you guys would.

1042
00:54:59.087 --> 00:55:02.924
On Saturday morning. at eight o'clock.
you guys will show up at the school.

1043
00:55:03.925 --> 00:55:06.469
Your daughter
will go in and take the test.

1044
00:55:06.553 --> 00:55:08.388
Mark will be your proctor.

1045
00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:11.266
She'll be the only one taking it
in the room with Mark.

1046
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:14.185
What we do with kids
who have learning differences

1047
00:55:14.269 --> 00:55:17.439
is they write their answers
on a separate sheet to the side of it

1048
00:55:17.522 --> 00:55:18.690
so that we can rebubble.

1049
00:55:18.773 --> 00:55:21.151
She'll think that
when she's done with the test.

1050
00:55:21.234 --> 00:55:23.320
she has taken the test. No doubt about it.

1051
00:55:23.403 --> 00:55:25.697
She'll walk out the door
and she'll say to you.

1052
00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.283
"Dad. it was so hard." or. "I'm so tired."

1053
00:55:28.366 --> 00:55:31.202
or whatever
the typical reaction out of the kid.

1054
00:55:31.703 --> 00:55:34.956
You guys will leave. and then
Mark will look at all her answers.

1055
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:36.791
Mark will then take the exam

1056
00:55:36.875 --> 00:55:40.795
and then ensure that whatever score
we decide that we want to get.

1057
00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:42.172
he has it down to a…

1058
00:55:42.255 --> 00:55:44.466
It's unbelievable what he can do.

1059
00:55:45.342 --> 00:55:47.761
She'll never know
that this actually occurred.

1060
00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:53.224
She'll look at her results and she'll say.
"Oh. my God. Dad. I got a 32."

1061
00:56:01.232 --> 00:56:03.068
[reporter] He's the test-taking whiz

1062
00:56:03.151 --> 00:56:07.572
who helped dozens of high school students
cheat on their college entrance exam.

1063
00:56:07.655 --> 00:56:11.993
Mark Riddell was the one who was
flying out to different testing locations

1064
00:56:12.077 --> 00:56:13.870
and proctoring or correcting answers.

1065
00:56:13.953 --> 00:56:17.624
I have a client
whose daughter was a big tennis player

1066
00:56:17.707 --> 00:56:19.918
and studied with him years ago.

1067
00:56:20.001 --> 00:56:26.633
He was a Harvard graduate who worked in
college exam prep for IMG Academy.

1068
00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:30.136
which is a school for athletes
in Bradenton. Florida.

1069
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:32.389
where Serena and Venus Williams went.

1070
00:56:32.472 --> 00:56:34.057
[Andy Lockwood] Very unassuming guy.

1071
00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:38.645
But the story was after he had
his first child and needed more money.

1072
00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:42.482
that's how he kind of got caught up
in the pitch from Rick Singer

1073
00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:45.568
to make a few extra
thousand dollars here and there.

1074
00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:49.906
He did not have inside information
about the correct answers.

1075
00:56:49.989 --> 00:56:54.494
He was just smart enough
to get a near-perfect score on demand.

1076
00:56:54.577 --> 00:57:00.041
If Rick Singer is the linchpin
of this college admissions scandal.

1077
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:02.961
then Mark Riddell is the brains.

1078
00:57:03.044 --> 00:57:05.880
[Bello] One of the things
that amuses me and annoys me

1079
00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:10.427
when I see most of the reports
around him being a test-taking savant.

1080
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:13.596
or whatever they choose
to call him in the moment. um…

1081
00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.809
He's an adult who's taking a test
designed for 11th graders.

1082
00:57:17.892 --> 00:57:22.230
Anyone worth their salt
in the test preparation industry

1083
00:57:22.313 --> 00:57:24.607
should be able to do what he did.

1084
00:57:24.691 --> 00:57:27.068
The question is
would they be willing to do it.

1085
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:30.363
[reporter] Singer. the admitted
mastermind behind the scheme.

1086
00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:32.991
paid Riddell $10.000 per test

1087
00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:37.745
to fly from his home in Florida
to test centers in Texas and California.

1088
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:39.998
[Bello] Pretty much everything
in the higher ed system

1089
00:57:40.081 --> 00:57:42.834
is based on trust in other people.

1090
00:57:42.917 --> 00:57:46.838
At what dollar value will you be
willing to compromise your ethics?

1091
00:57:46.921 --> 00:57:48.548
That's the ultimate question.

1092
00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:53.553
For me. it keeps coming back to.
it's the wealthy who have the ability.

1093
00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:56.181
and. in this case.
the means and the willingness.

1094
00:57:56.264 --> 00:57:58.349
to take advantage of these things.

1095
00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:00.977
[Janavs] Rick. I had a question for you.

1096
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:03.771
I was able to get
my younger daughter the multi-day ACT.

1097
00:58:03.855 --> 00:58:06.983
[Singer] Good. You got her extended time
over multiple days. Got it.

1098
00:58:07.066 --> 00:58:08.443
Yeah. so I got that.

1099
00:58:08.526 --> 00:58:11.821
The thing is. my younger daughter
is not like my older daughter.

1100
00:58:11.905 --> 00:58:12.864
She's not stupid.

1101
00:58:12.947 --> 00:58:15.742
If I said to her.
"Oh. we're gonna take it up at Rick's."

1102
00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:17.202
she's gonna wonder why.

1103
00:58:19.037 --> 00:58:20.413
[reporter] Michelle Janavs.

1104
00:58:20.497 --> 00:58:23.666
whose family created
the famous snack Hot Pockets.

1105
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:28.213
accused of paying 100 grand
to boost her daughter's ACT score

1106
00:58:28.296 --> 00:58:32.091
and get her into USC
as a bogus volleyball recruit.

1107
00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:34.719
[Janavs] How do you do this
without telling the kids?

1108
00:58:34.802 --> 00:58:38.014
Well. in most cases. Michelle.
none of the kids know.

1109
00:58:38.097 --> 00:58:39.182
Right. but how…

1110
00:58:39.265 --> 00:58:42.852
No. I understand she won't even know.
but how do you explain it to her?

1111
00:58:43.436 --> 00:58:44.896
You don't have to say anything.

1112
00:58:44.979 --> 00:58:47.774
For the school.
say you'll be up in LA for the weekend.

1113
00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:49.776
[Janavs] That's what we did last time.

1114
00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:52.445
My younger daughter
is the issue. because she'll say.

1115
00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:54.614
"Like. why am I taking it up there?"

1116
00:58:54.697 --> 00:58:57.951
You'll just say that.
"You're going to do it up here

1117
00:58:58.034 --> 00:59:01.204
because it's really easy.
It's convenient."

1118
00:59:02.121 --> 00:59:07.835
I thought the conversations that were
recorded on tape were achingly poignant.

1119
00:59:07.919 --> 00:59:10.964
You ache for the children
who read these transcripts.

1120
00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:13.841
and you may also ache
for the parents who. I'm sure.

1121
00:59:13.925 --> 00:59:15.927
bitterly regret being so candid.

1122
00:59:16.844 --> 00:59:17.887
She's smart.

1123
00:59:18.596 --> 00:59:20.306
She's gonna figure this out.

1124
00:59:21.015 --> 00:59:22.225
She's gonna say to me…

1125
00:59:23.142 --> 00:59:26.729
She already thinks that I'm.
like. up to no good. and I just…

1126
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.190
I didn't wanna talk about this with her.

1127
00:59:29.274 --> 00:59:32.277
No. no. yeah. I got it. I totally get it.

1128
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.862
[Janavs] She's totally different
than my older daughter.

1129
00:59:34.946 --> 00:59:36.864
Like. she really needs to think that…

1130
00:59:36.948 --> 00:59:39.826
My older daughter was like.
"I don't really care."

1131
00:59:39.909 --> 00:59:42.161
"This test is bullshit.
I don't wanna take it."

1132
00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:45.999
And my younger daughter is
actually studying to try to get a 34.

1133
00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:46.958
So it would…

1134
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.919
It would actually be a great boost to her.

1135
00:59:50.003 --> 00:59:52.672
My older daughter.
she came to me and she was like.

1136
00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:55.008
"You're not gonna
tell my sister. are you?"

1137
00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.926
And I was like. "No."

1138
00:59:57.927 --> 00:59:59.095
It's weird.

1139
00:59:59.679 --> 01:00:03.182
It's just weird family dynamics.
but every kid is different.

1140
01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:04.976
Cool.

1141
01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:14.652
[Golden] Rick Singer's lifestyle
did change and become more lavish.

1142
01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:17.697
He moved from
Sacramento area to Newport Beach

1143
01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.158
and had a very nice house there.

1144
01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:25.079
Singer invested
in a whole bunch of quixotic ventures.

1145
01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:29.542
Restaurants. a soccer team.
and many other things.

1146
01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.127
So the money came in fast

1147
01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:35.131
and it seems to have gone out pretty fast
to his lifestyle and his investments.

1148
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:38.926
[cell phone ringing]

1149
01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:41.387
[Logan] Rick called me
out of the blue and said.

1150
01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.306
"I haven't talked to you in a year.

1151
01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:46.184
I remember you
being extremely sharp with marketing

1152
01:00:46.267 --> 01:00:48.478
in the restaurant business.
in real estate.

1153
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:51.105
I think you'd be perfect
as opening up and running

1154
01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:54.901
one of my offshoot companies
of my coaching business."

1155
01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:56.944
And I thought they sounded great.

1156
01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:03.618
Rick had invited a group of us
to a big conference up in LA

1157
01:01:03.701 --> 01:01:06.162
with all these
very high-powered individuals.

1158
01:01:06.245 --> 01:01:09.165
From my understanding.
there was an influx of many millions

1159
01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:12.460
coming in to help him
launch some of these businesses.

1160
01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:14.420
We all were assigned our positions.

1161
01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:18.007
and then we all took off to start up
these brand-new companies.

1162
01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:19.258
It was really exciting.

1163
01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:22.136
Rick offered to drive us
back to the airport.

1164
01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:26.182
[chuckling] So we get in his Tesla.
and it's rush hour traffic.

1165
01:01:26.265 --> 01:01:31.020
Rick is zipping in and out of traffic.
going 90 miles an hour.

1166
01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.439
We were on the edge of our seats.
hanging on.

1167
01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:38.277
So we finally
get to the airport in one piece.

1168
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:41.364
He said. "Bye. Good to see you again.
I'll see you soon."

1169
01:01:41.447 --> 01:01:44.826
Go to give him a hug.
and he plants a kiss on me. [laughs]

1170
01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:47.829
And I said. "What was that all about?"

1171
01:01:47.912 --> 01:01:50.915
And he says. "Well. I wanted to see.

1172
01:01:50.998 --> 01:01:55.628
Maybe there's something here.
Maybe we could date."

1173
01:01:56.254 --> 01:01:59.716
I looked at him and said. "You know what?
I knew you from back when.

1174
01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:04.762
The amount of time that you spend
with your career. with your businesses.

1175
01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:08.099
the little amount of time
you'd even have to return a phone call.

1176
01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:13.521
let alone send a two-line text is…
We'll never work."

1177
01:02:18.484 --> 01:02:20.027
My name is Rick Singer.

1178
01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:23.114
My job is to life coach kids and families

1179
01:02:23.197 --> 01:02:25.408
through the process
of getting into college.

1180
01:02:25.491 --> 01:02:27.535
We have families in Champaign. in Miami.

1181
01:02:27.618 --> 01:02:32.123
They send their plane to come pick me up.
come to the meeting for a couple hours.

1182
01:02:32.206 --> 01:02:35.418
put me back on the plane.
send me to the next place I need to go.

1183
01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:36.419
It's amazing.

1184
01:02:36.502 --> 01:02:41.466
[Logan] When I watched that video
that he sent to do this reality show.

1185
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:43.509
it was a bit shocking to me.

1186
01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:47.388
We work in the home of all these families.
so we know them intimately.

1187
01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:50.725
I know what their bedrooms look like.
what the laundry room looks like.

1188
01:02:50.808 --> 01:02:52.894
How they get along. So I know where…

1189
01:02:52.977 --> 01:02:57.857
I thought. "Really? You're gonna put
yourself out there like that for this?"

1190
01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:01.235
It just didn't make sense.
Everything was so private with him.

1191
01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:03.821
The whole time they're yelling.
"It's my life!

1192
01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:06.407
If you go to this school…
It's the wrong school.

1193
01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:10.244
I don't wanna pay 50.000
to go to this school!" Unbelievable.

1194
01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:11.662
It just didn't make sense.

1195
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:17.418
especially at the caliber of the coach
that I. you know. believed that he was.

1196
01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:22.757
He didn't have
a lot of time for people in his life.

1197
01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:26.928
He was married for years.
and he has a son.

1198
01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:30.556
When I met him. he was divorced
probably six. seven years.

1199
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:33.559
He'd say. "I'll only do this coaching

1200
01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:37.605
for another three. four.
maybe five years. and then I'm done."

1201
01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:43.319
I don't know.
I really don't know what made him happy

1202
01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:46.364
or what his desires even were.

1203
01:03:46.864 --> 01:03:48.991
It's almost like on a rat wheel.

1204
01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:54.288
trying to get to a means to an end.
and there was really no end in sight.

1205
01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:03.589
[Caplan] So I… It's just you and me.
I mean. is that kosher? Can we--

1206
01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:04.674
[Singer] Absolutely.

1207
01:04:04.757 --> 01:04:07.134
Part of the reason
I'm taking my wife off this.

1208
01:04:07.218 --> 01:04:09.971
she's very nervous
about all this. and I just…

1209
01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:13.975
Uh. I wanna have a… um…
Let me ask you straight up.

1210
01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:17.895
You've never had an issue with this?
No one's ever gotten in trouble with this?

1211
01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:19.522
Never had an issue with anybody.

1212
01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.899
[Caplan] Could you ever
see that happening?

1213
01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:23.150
I'm not…

1214
01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:25.736
I've never seen it happen.

1215
01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:29.156
[Caplan] What I'm asking is
could this ever get back to my daughter

1216
01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.867
or to the family?

1217
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:33.327
I mean. this comes out… I. uh…

1218
01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:36.414
[chuckles] I don't…
I don't even wanna know what you guys do.

1219
01:04:36.497 --> 01:04:39.709
I'm just…
Uh. Rick. so you… you understand--

1220
01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:41.377
No. I totally get it.

1221
01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.422
[Caplan] You're absolutely confident
there's no issue here?

1222
01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:46.090
[chuckles]

1223
01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:48.217
We've been doing this for a long time.

1224
01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:49.886
[Caplan] Let me put it differently.

1225
01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:53.639
If somebody were to catch this.
what happens?

1226
01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:57.101
The only way someone can catch it
is if you guys tell someone.

1227
01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:59.520
-[Caplan] I'm not gonna tell anybody.
-Well?

1228
01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:01.147
[Caplan] It's just…

1229
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:04.483
To be honest. I'm not
worried about the moral issue here.

1230
01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.652
I'm worried about the…

1231
01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:10.281
She gets caught doing that.
you know. she's finished.

1232
01:05:10.364 --> 01:05:12.116
So I… I just. uh…

1233
01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:14.869
It's never happened before
in 20-some-odd years.

1234
01:05:14.952 --> 01:05:16.871
The only thing that can happen is if--

1235
01:05:16.954 --> 01:05:20.708
-[Caplan] Someone talks.
-Yeah. if she tells somebody.

1236
01:05:20.791 --> 01:05:23.878
[Caplan] Oh. yeah.
I. uh… She… She won't talk.

1237
01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:33.846
Singer didn't make a fateful mistake
that led to his being. uh. exposed.

1238
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:36.474
What happened
is that somebody was arrested

1239
01:05:36.557 --> 01:05:39.310
on an unrelated securities charge.

1240
01:05:39.393 --> 01:05:41.687
and that person traded information.

1241
01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:43.856
That financial executive said.

1242
01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.902
"You may be interested to know that
a coach at Yale asked me for a bribe."

1243
01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:50.446
A gentleman by the name of Rudy Meredith.

1244
01:05:50.529 --> 01:05:55.159
who had been working with parents
to get their children into Yale

1245
01:05:55.242 --> 01:05:59.121
under the guise
that they were going to be soccer players.

1246
01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:01.624
The first question they ask Mr. Meredith

1247
01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:04.710
after they investigated
and indicted him was.

1248
01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:07.088
"Is there anything you'd like to tell me?"

1249
01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:10.132
"Yes. there is.
There's a gentleman named Rick Singer

1250
01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:11.550
who I'd like to introduce you to.

1251
01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:16.180
and I'm happy to cooperate against him
because I don't wanna go to prison."

1252
01:06:16.263 --> 01:06:19.517
So just like that.
Rudy Meredith is a cooperating informant.

1253
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.394
Then he cooperates against Singer.

1254
01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:24.730
[cell phone dings]

1255
01:06:33.364 --> 01:06:34.657
[cell phone dings]

1256
01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:39.745
[cell phone dings]

1257
01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:52.675
Thank you.

1258
01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:17.033
Hi. Rick.

1259
01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:23.247
Why don't you step inside?

1260
01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:31.005
[door creaking]

1261
01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.134
[Singer]
It will happen as though…

1262
01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:38.387
She will think she's really super smart
and she got lucky on a test.

1263
01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:39.930
and you got a score now.

1264
01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:41.766
It's the home run of home runs.

1265
01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:43.809
-[Caplan] And it works?
-[Singer] Every time.

1266
01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.061
[Singer and Caplan chuckle]

1267
01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:53.402
[agent] Singer agreed
to cooperate with our investigation

1268
01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:55.112
and to be interviewed.

1269
01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:58.657
However. he was not fully forthcoming
regarding parts of his scheme.

1270
01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:01.619
and it was my impression
that he was not taking

1271
01:08:01.702 --> 01:08:04.080
full responsibility for his conduct.

1272
01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:06.665
Singer told us that
the payments he and his clients

1273
01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:10.669
made to university
athletics programs were donations.

1274
01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:13.297
We informed him that a payment in exchange

1275
01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:17.259
for recruiting a fake student athlete
to an athletic team is illegal.

1276
01:08:18.177 --> 01:08:21.222
The next day.
after consulting with his attorney.

1277
01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:24.475
Singer agreed
to consensually record phone calls

1278
01:08:24.558 --> 01:08:27.311
with other individuals
involved in his scheme.

1279
01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:31.732
For those calls.
we instructed Singer to engage in a ruse.

1280
01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:39.031
[Singer] Uh. so the reason
I'm calling is. uh. so.

1281
01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:42.243
uh. my foundation is getting audited now.

1282
01:08:42.326 --> 01:08:45.037
-Oh. Well. that sucks.
-[Singer] Uh… Yeah. Right?

1283
01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.665
-They're going back like they always do.
-Yeah.

1284
01:08:47.748 --> 01:08:50.751
[reporter 1] Elizabeth and
Manuel Henriquezof Atherton.

1285
01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:54.213
[reporter 2] They're accused
of paying $400.000 in bribes.

1286
01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.507
So they're taking a look
at all my payments.

1287
01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:59.885
They asked about the large sums
of money that came in from you guys.

1288
01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:00.803
[Elizabeth] Okay.

1289
01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.389
-[Singer] Essentially--
-For all the good deeds that you do.

1290
01:09:03.472 --> 01:09:06.767
[Singer] Absolutely. Of course
I didn't say anything. you know?

1291
01:09:06.851 --> 01:09:11.689
I'm not gonna tell the IRS that Mark took
the test for Isabelle. or that Gordie--

1292
01:09:11.772 --> 01:09:13.107
[Elizabeth] Mm-hmm. right. Yeah.

1293
01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:17.319
[Singer] Or that Gordie… Uh. we paid
Gordieto help get into Georgetown. right?

1294
01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:18.320
Right.

1295
01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:22.241
[Singer] So I just wanna make sure
that you and I are on the same page.

1296
01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:24.285
-Okay.
-[Singer] In case they were to call.

1297
01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:25.786
So what's your story?

1298
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:30.040
So my story is essentially that
you gave your money to our foundation

1299
01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:31.876
to help underserved kids.

1300
01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:34.545
-[Elizabeth] You… Uh… Of course.
-[Singer] And. uh…

1301
01:09:34.628 --> 01:09:36.422
[Elizabeth] Those kids
have to go to school.

1302
01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:37.590
Absolutely.

1303
01:09:45.931 --> 01:09:46.765
Okay.

1304
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:49.852
[Paperny] I'm not surprised
at Singer's level of involvement.

1305
01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:53.022
Much like he seized
an opportunity to enrich himself

1306
01:09:53.105 --> 01:09:55.065
to help get their children into school.

1307
01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:58.652
he equally seized another opportunity
to earn cooperation credit.

1308
01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:01.155
He was just as zealous
in cooperating

1309
01:10:01.238 --> 01:10:04.366
as he was in getting parents
to pay him to get their kids into school.

1310
01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:19.256
-So there's no paper trail of money?
-No. there's no paper trail of money.

1311
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.716
Right.

1312
01:10:20.799 --> 01:10:22.885
So why did Isabelle
do the test in Houston?

1313
01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:24.678
We gotta get into that story.

1314
01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:27.765
So let me go into it. Uh…

1315
01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:32.895
Essentially. there's nowhere
where anybody knows.

1316
01:10:32.978 --> 01:10:36.815
because. in my books. it doesn't show
that there was any money paid to Mark

1317
01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:39.735
for taking the test for Isabelle. Okay?

1318
01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:43.322
It doesn't show anything at all
in our foundation or anything.

1319
01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:44.448
Just so you know.

1320
01:10:45.824 --> 01:10:46.825
Right.

1321
01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:50.621
So the question is. uh.
if anybody calls me. the response is.

1322
01:10:50.704 --> 01:10:52.665
"No comment on the Houston issue."

1323
01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:55.000
Remember. she went there
because she needed special--

1324
01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.294
-I understand.
-Accommodations.

1325
01:10:58.128 --> 01:10:59.463
Accommodations.

1326
01:10:59.546 --> 01:11:01.090
But I'm not gonna comment.

1327
01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:04.218
We gotta be very careful
getting inbound calls.

1328
01:11:04.885 --> 01:11:06.178
"I've no idea who you are.

1329
01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.847
so I won't respond
to an inbound call from anybody."

1330
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.545
[Vandemoer] Rick said.
"I wanna continue our relationship."

1331
01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:42.840
"I wanna call you in a week.
and talk about another donation

1332
01:11:42.923 --> 01:11:46.343
like I did with the $110.000.
I'd like to continue to do that."

1333
01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:48.887
I said. "Great."
So he was true to his word.

1334
01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:51.557
He called me a week to two weeks later.

1335
01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.392
I was rushing out the door.

1336
01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:56.145
but he's talking to me
the whole time on this call.

1337
01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:57.980
I'm just "yeah-ing" him to death.

1338
01:11:58.063 --> 01:12:02.401
He said he wants to donate $160.000
right now. and he'd give the rest later.

1339
01:12:02.484 --> 01:12:04.903
to continue a deposit on our relationship.

1340
01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:08.157
The only word
I really picked up was "deposit."

1341
01:12:08.741 --> 01:12:10.909
I took it as his deposit on a relationship

1342
01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:14.079
was that he would
bring me more recruits to consider.

1343
01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.457
And we'd see how it would go from there.

1344
01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:20.210
Then I didn't hear anything from
Rick again and still haven't. actually.

1345
01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:22.421
That was the last conversation we had.

1346
01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:25.424
That phone call was set up by the FBI.

1347
01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:28.010
It turns out that was the most. uh…

1348
01:12:28.093 --> 01:12:30.929
tragic and most devastating
phone call of my life.

1349
01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:33.432
[Singer] I wanna make sure
we're confirmed that.

1350
01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:37.102
going forward. I'm going to at least
potentially have a spot with you.

1351
01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:41.148
It'll probably be an athlete like the
other student who wasn't an actual sailor.

1352
01:12:41.231 --> 01:12:42.107
[Vandemoer] Okay.

1353
01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.109
I'll put together a profile for her.

1354
01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:48.572
and. uh… put all the major regattas
that I come up with from the Internet.

1355
01:12:48.655 --> 01:12:50.157
and bring someone to you.

1356
01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.035
-Then we'll make a payment to you again.
-[Vandemoer] Great.

1357
01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:55.496
[man] As someone who's defending somebody.

1358
01:12:55.579 --> 01:12:58.248
how did you feel hearing that tape?

1359
01:13:00.417 --> 01:13:01.919
Um… [chuckles]

1360
01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:05.589
It wasn't good. um. from my point of view.

1361
01:13:05.672 --> 01:13:06.548
Um…

1362
01:13:07.132 --> 01:13:09.968
And it would have been tough at trial.
Tapes are…

1363
01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:12.888
When I was a prosecutor.
I did a lot of wiretaps.

1364
01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:15.808
And I played
a lot of wiretap calls or tapes.

1365
01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.685
And juries love hearing wiretap calls.

1366
01:13:19.269 --> 01:13:21.688
They can be good evidence.
I explained that to him.

1367
01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:24.525
I heard the call.
I thought this was a good one.

1368
01:13:24.608 --> 01:13:26.860
and it could be tough to explain.

1369
01:13:27.444 --> 01:13:31.281
[Singer] So I wanted to let you know.
our foundation is… is being audited.

1370
01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:32.282
Yeah.

1371
01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:34.952
-[Singer] Which is very normal. right?
-Yeah.

1372
01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:36.912
[Singer] They've been
auditing my foundation.

1373
01:13:36.995 --> 01:13:37.830
Okay.

1374
01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:40.249
-[Singer] Which is pretty typical.
-Uh-huh.

1375
01:13:40.332 --> 01:13:43.168
-[Singer] My foundation is being audited.
-Uh-huh.

1376
01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.379
Like everybody
on the planet. huh? [chuckles]

1377
01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:46.338
[man] Sure.

1378
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.173
So they've been looking at…

1379
01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:51.093
[Fisher] This wasn't
a typical sting operation.

1380
01:13:51.176 --> 01:13:53.679
If you look back
at the larger. white-collar cases.

1381
01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:56.515
Enron. for example.
the leadership is indicted.

1382
01:13:56.598 --> 01:14:01.812
Maybe the CEO. the CFO. uh. the COO.
and then. really. the indictments end.

1383
01:14:01.895 --> 01:14:06.859
Traditionally. a large RICO indictment
like this is gonna be organized crime.

1384
01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:09.486
If you're going after
a syndicate that deals drugs.

1385
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:12.072
you start with local level dealers.
flip one of them.

1386
01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:14.783
get a wire. work your way
up to the middle-level dealer.

1387
01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:16.743
and you end up with the kingpin.

1388
01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:21.081
Here. Rick Singer was selling the product.
and yet you had him first.

1389
01:14:21.165 --> 01:14:25.127
Then you worked your way down the chain
to get the buyers of the product.

1390
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.671
[Singer] They started
an audit on my foundation.

1391
01:14:27.754 --> 01:14:28.589
Yeah.

1392
01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:30.757
-[Singer] Which is typical. right?
-Okay.

1393
01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:32.968
-[Singer] Which is pretty natural.
-Yeah.

1394
01:14:33.051 --> 01:14:34.344
[Singer] I'm gonna tell the IRS

1395
01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:37.264
that your donation
to our foundation essentially went--

1396
01:14:37.347 --> 01:14:39.641
Wait. wait. Rick.
Let me ask you a question.

1397
01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:43.145
Shouldn't we get together over this
as opposed to over the phone?

1398
01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:44.938
[Singer] Whatever you wanna do. I'm fine.

1399
01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:49.318
All I'm gonna tell the IRS
is that your donation to our foundation

1400
01:14:49.401 --> 01:14:52.070
went to help underserved kids. That's it.

1401
01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.489
[Sloane] Yeah. Yeah. yeah.

1402
01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:55.782
[Paperny] In listening
to some of the tapes of Singer.

1403
01:14:55.866 --> 01:14:58.118
he's as skilled as I've ever heard

1404
01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:01.872
of getting someone
to acknowledge wrongdoing.

1405
01:15:01.955 --> 01:15:03.874
Yeah. he was pretty good on the phone.

1406
01:15:03.957 --> 01:15:07.336
but that's only gonna work
with these white-collar professionals.

1407
01:15:07.419 --> 01:15:12.299
Historically. white-collar defendants
have almost no filter on the phone.

1408
01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:16.178
We know people at Goldman Sachs
who. you know. recommended you highly.

1409
01:15:16.261 --> 01:15:19.848
My husband and I laugh every day
about how great your work was.

1410
01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:22.184
We're like. "It was worth every cent."

1411
01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:25.312
If he was talking
to organized crime members.

1412
01:15:25.395 --> 01:15:29.566
he would have been made as a cooperator
within 30 seconds on the call.

1413
01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:34.071
So. what I want is to make sure
that you and I are both on the same page.

1414
01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:36.156
Because I'm going to tell them

1415
01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.370
that you made a $50K donation
to my foundation to help underserved kids.

1416
01:15:41.453 --> 01:15:43.914
Not that Mark
took the test for your daughter

1417
01:15:43.997 --> 01:15:46.708
or that she took the test
at the West Hollywood test center.

1418
01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.377
What do you think. I'm a moron?

1419
01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.880
No. I… I'm not saying you're a moron.
The point is that--

1420
01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:53.632
[Huneeus] I got it. Rick. I got it.

1421
01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:55.175
I'll say I've been inspired.

1422
01:15:55.259 --> 01:15:58.679
how you're helping underprivileged
kids get into college. Got it.

1423
01:15:58.762 --> 01:16:00.305
Hey. Rick. I…

1424
01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:01.932
You know. I don't…

1425
01:16:02.015 --> 01:16:04.768
You know. whatever you do.
you do. you know?

1426
01:16:04.851 --> 01:16:07.688
I really don't feel comfortable
talking to you about this

1427
01:16:07.771 --> 01:16:09.940
in terms of kind of. you know. your…

1428
01:16:10.023 --> 01:16:10.857
In terms of…

1429
01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:13.402
In terms of kind of your…
You know. your dealings.

1430
01:16:13.986 --> 01:16:17.114
[reporter] Stephen Semprevivo.
a Los Angeles businessman.

1431
01:16:17.197 --> 01:16:23.412
paying $400.000 to get his son
into Georgetown as a fake tennis recruit.

1432
01:16:23.495 --> 01:16:26.707
You know. all I know is that
we used you for the charity stuff

1433
01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:28.542
and we used you for the counseling.

1434
01:16:28.625 --> 01:16:31.128
and your dealings are your dealings.
And so. you know…

1435
01:16:31.211 --> 01:16:33.088
[Singer] No. I get that.
I understand that.

1436
01:16:33.171 --> 01:16:35.173
But at the same time. we were all a part--

1437
01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.342
No. I don't agree with that at all.

1438
01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.761
You don't agree
that we got him in through tennis?

1439
01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.680
[Semprevivo] I don't. I don't. I…

1440
01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:44.891
You know. you did what you did.
and that was your stuff. okay?

1441
01:16:44.975 --> 01:16:46.768
-Okay.
-You did what you did.

1442
01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:50.439
I won't take accountability for it.
You need to be accountable for--

1443
01:16:50.522 --> 01:16:52.899
[Singer] Absolutely.
I'm absolutely accountable.

1444
01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:55.902
that I got him in through tennis.
and that you guys were aware of it.

1445
01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:59.281
I'm totally aware of it
and I accept total responsibility

1446
01:16:59.364 --> 01:17:02.659
that I used my relationship
and made your son a tennis player.

1447
01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:05.537
We all agreed
that that's what we were going to do.

1448
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:07.289
You know. I don't have any details.

1449
01:17:07.372 --> 01:17:10.208
but I think you need
to be accountable for what you did.

1450
01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:13.295
So I don't wanna talk
about this anymore because. you know…

1451
01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:15.672
I think there were two separate things.

1452
01:17:15.756 --> 01:17:18.634
And we used you. and we donated.

1453
01:17:18.717 --> 01:17:21.219
We donated as a charity.
and it was a good charity.

1454
01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:22.804
We were excited we could help.

1455
01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:25.641
In terms of
how you do favors for people separately.

1456
01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:28.060
that's. you know. I…

1457
01:17:28.852 --> 01:17:31.605
We appreciate any help you gave us.

1458
01:17:31.688 --> 01:17:34.483
But. you know.
we used you in terms of the…

1459
01:17:34.566 --> 01:17:36.777
In terms of your college stuff.

1460
01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:39.571
We paid you well
for the work you did there separately.

1461
01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:42.032
So… And we appreciate it.

1462
01:17:42.115 --> 01:17:43.450
So I think that…

1463
01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:46.078
If you're trying to turn something around

1464
01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:48.330
in terms of what you did
and how you did it.

1465
01:17:48.413 --> 01:17:49.539
then I don't wanna be…

1466
01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:51.249
I don't wanna be a part of that.

1467
01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:55.754
You know. I'm so paranoid about
this fucking thing you were talking about.

1468
01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:58.215
I don't like talking about it
on the phone.

1469
01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:02.678
I mean. I'm thinking. you know. are they…

1470
01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:05.722
I can't imagine they'd go
to the trouble of tapping my phone.

1471
01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:08.141
but would they tap
someone like your phones?

1472
01:18:08.225 --> 01:18:11.436
[reporter] Real estate tycoon
Bruce Isackson and his wife Davina

1473
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.189
paying $600.000 to help
their two daughters

1474
01:18:14.272 --> 01:18:16.149
get into UCLA and USC

1475
01:18:16.233 --> 01:18:20.112
through the test cheating scheme
and the athletic recruitment scheme.

1476
01:18:20.612 --> 01:18:23.573
Worst case. we'd get a call
from them and they'd say to you.

1477
01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:25.450
"Prove you gave this money…"

1478
01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.619
-They'd ask for some.
-But you did.

1479
01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:28.954
[breathing heavily] Yeah.

1480
01:18:29.579 --> 01:18:31.998
But… I'm just thinking that…

1481
01:18:32.082 --> 01:18:34.626
Oh. my God. [sputtering]
Because you're thinking…

1482
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:40.048
If they get into the meat and potatoes.
is this gonna be a front-page story?

1483
01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:42.050
Well. the person
who'd be on the front page--

1484
01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:44.094
[Isackson] Yeah. but will I… But… But if…

1485
01:18:44.177 --> 01:18:48.098
If they got into the meat and potatoes.
which a guy would love to have is…

1486
01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:51.101
Look how hard it is
for these kids to get into college and…

1487
01:18:51.184 --> 01:18:53.145
Look what's going on behind the scenes.

1488
01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:57.149
And then… you know. the embarrassment
to everyone in the communities.

1489
01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:58.108
My God.

1490
01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:00.318
It'd just be. uh…

1491
01:19:02.362 --> 01:19:03.697
God. just…

1492
01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:05.741
Oh…

1493
01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:21.965
[Vandemoer] Fast forward a couple months.
we go through the Christmas season.

1494
01:19:22.048 --> 01:19:25.343
we get a knock on the door
at 7:00. 7:30 in the morning

1495
01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.804
and it's two women.

1496
01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:30.015
They kinda hold up badges and say.

1497
01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:33.059
"I'm from the IRS."
and "I'm from the FBI."

1498
01:19:33.143 --> 01:19:35.896
I said. "What's this about?
What can I help you with?"

1499
01:19:35.979 --> 01:19:40.192
"Oh. we just have a few questions
in terms of college admissions and so on."

1500
01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:42.194
I said. "Whatever I can do to help."

1501
01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:45.238
The FBI agent started
asking questions about Rick Singer.

1502
01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:48.325
I described our relationship.
that he brought me recruits.

1503
01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:50.327
he was donating. and they said.

1504
01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:53.663
"No. that's not what it was.
It was you taking bribes."

1505
01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:55.957
They kinda wrapped up with saying that.

1506
01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:58.710
"Stanford knows about this.
They're really angry with you."

1507
01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:01.963
They gave me their cards
and they said goodbye.

1508
01:20:03.006 --> 01:20:06.885
I promptly went upstairs.
sat down on my bed and cried.

1509
01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:08.929
I didn't know what happened.

1510
01:20:09.012 --> 01:20:12.349
John Vandemoer reached out to me.
He was in need of an attorney.

1511
01:20:12.432 --> 01:20:14.184
There was such a sense of urgency.

1512
01:20:14.267 --> 01:20:16.186
"You have to meet him before next week.

1513
01:20:16.269 --> 01:20:20.190
We have to know if he's gonna take
a plea deal or not within 48 hours."

1514
01:20:20.273 --> 01:20:21.942
He flew in the red-eye.

1515
01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:26.196
I'd never met him before.
but he just looked… He was tired.

1516
01:20:26.279 --> 01:20:30.075
and obviously extremely upset
at what was about to happen.

1517
01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:34.955
And he says. "So it's not good.
You're being charged with mail fraud.

1518
01:20:35.038 --> 01:20:36.748
tax fraud and wire fraud."

1519
01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:39.835
"Each of those counts carry
a 20-year sentence in prison."

1520
01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:42.838
The allegation is that he joined
Rick Singer's conspiracy.

1521
01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:46.550
the object of which was to help
these students. who were not sailors.

1522
01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:50.554
get recruited for his team so they would
gain access or admission to Stanford.

1523
01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:51.721
In exchange for that.

1524
01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:54.975
Rick would wire him money or mail a check.
or hand him a check.

1525
01:20:55.058 --> 01:20:57.477
That triggers
the wire fraud and the mail fraud.

1526
01:20:57.561 --> 01:21:00.897
[Vandemoer] They already had Stanford
willing to testify against me.

1527
01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:03.358
Rick Singer was gonna testify against me.

1528
01:21:03.441 --> 01:21:06.111
I didn't really
have any evidence on my side.

1529
01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:08.780
Between my wife and my dad and I.

1530
01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:12.367
we kinda decided that it made
sense for me to plead guilty.

1531
01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:14.661
um. and be a felon
for the rest of my life.

1532
01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:20.625
[Fisher] When you plead guilty. you must
meet with the Department of Probation.

1533
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:22.043
He was being interviewed.

1534
01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:26.256
[Vandemoer] At the time when I was in that
interview. that's when the story broke.

1535
01:21:26.339 --> 01:21:30.552
We're here today to announce charges
in the largest college admissions scam

1536
01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:33.054
ever prosecuted
by the Department of Justice.

1537
01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:36.141
We've charged 50 people nationwide.

1538
01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:40.145
[Witz] I was in Las Vegas covering
some conference basketball tournament

1539
01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:44.733
when I got a phone call early
in the morning from an editor saying.

1540
01:21:44.816 --> 01:21:49.529
"What are you doing? Whatever it is.
drop it and get to Los Angeles."

1541
01:21:49.613 --> 01:21:52.908
Breaking headline of that massive
college cheating scandal late today.

1542
01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:56.703
Dozens of actors. coaches
and CEOs are among those charged.

1543
01:21:57.954 --> 01:22:00.624
[Fisher] And my phone started blowing up.

1544
01:22:00.707 --> 01:22:03.084
[Vandemoer] My lawyer was looking
at his phone the whole time.

1545
01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:05.712
and it was like. you know. "This is huge."

1546
01:22:05.795 --> 01:22:09.007
Thirty-three parents have been charged.
including Lori Loughlin…

1547
01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.884
[reporter] Authorities arrest
Felicity Huffman

1548
01:22:10.967 --> 01:22:12.427
at her Hollywood Hills home.

1549
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:14.471
They had guns drawn and everything.

1550
01:22:14.554 --> 01:22:16.264
[reporter 2] Raids on
the homes of the rich.

1551
01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:17.390
[officer] FBI!

1552
01:22:17.474 --> 01:22:20.018
Every single one
of these parents should be in jail.

1553
01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:22.479
How the schools fell for these photoshops…

1554
01:22:22.562 --> 01:22:24.773
Use your heads. people. That's not…

1555
01:22:24.856 --> 01:22:28.860
Olivia Giannulli was famous
for her presence on social media.

1556
01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:32.113
Now she's become
target number one for public outrage.

1557
01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:34.532
[reporter 3] Her famous parents
are charged with spending

1558
01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:38.244
half a million dollars in bribes
to get their daughters into USC.

1559
01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:40.538
I started watching Olivia three years ago.

1560
01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:43.708
I've been watching pretty much
every single one of her videos.

1561
01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:47.754
She goes and cheats to get into school?

1562
01:22:47.837 --> 01:22:51.800
And takes a spot
from possibly one of her own fans?

1563
01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:53.718
She lost a lot of her sponsorships.

1564
01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:57.555
They discontinued a makeup palette
that she did with Sephora.

1565
01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:00.183
[cameraman] Hey. Olivia. How are you?

1566
01:23:00.266 --> 01:23:04.688
How are you after the college scandal?
Have you been speaking to your mom?

1567
01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:10.276
[Fry] In a weird way. she has almost
become a bigger celebrity because of this.

1568
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:13.655
[cameraman] Olivia. it's good to see you
back out and about.

1569
01:23:13.738 --> 01:23:14.864
Feeling confident?

1570
01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:20.370
People attacked her on Instagram
and her comments were flooded with stuff.

1571
01:23:20.453 --> 01:23:23.456
[girl] She can look at
people's comments on the Internet

1572
01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.583
and be. "They're just trolls." No.

1573
01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:28.712
I'm not trolling you. dude.
I'm pissed.

1574
01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:30.338
I'm disappointed in you.

1575
01:23:30.922 --> 01:23:35.844
And. um… the only thing
I have left to say about this…

1576
01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:39.347
[reporters clamoring]

1577
01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:45.812
[reporter] John Vandemoer agreed to accept
more than $600.000 from Rick Singer.

1578
01:23:45.895 --> 01:23:49.024
the alleged mastermind
of the college admissions scandal.

1579
01:23:49.107 --> 01:23:52.569
A neighbor texted me and said.
"Are you reading those articles?"

1580
01:23:52.652 --> 01:23:54.070
"Do you see who it is?"

1581
01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:57.407
And it was.
"Oh. my gosh. it's Rick Singer."

1582
01:23:57.490 --> 01:23:59.159
I started jumping up and down.

1583
01:23:59.242 --> 01:24:00.910
I said. "I can't believe it."

1584
01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:04.497
"I can't believe they caught the guy.
I cannot believe it."

1585
01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:07.625
The messages I was getting
on my phone. the news alerts.

1586
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.753
it really was. I thought.

1587
01:24:09.836 --> 01:24:12.922
an overwhelming
reaction to a criminal case.

1588
01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:15.341
[Vandemoer] Walked outside.
which wasn't a good idea.

1589
01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:18.762
There was cameras in my face.
questions being blurted out.

1590
01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:21.973
-[reporter] What made you plead guilty?
-[Vandemoer] It was overwhelming.

1591
01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.016
It was a mob scene.

1592
01:24:23.099 --> 01:24:26.227
[Vandemoer] You're not allowed
to have your cell phone in the courthouse.

1593
01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:30.065
I checked my phone. and I have an email
from Stanford telling me I'm fired.

1594
01:24:30.148 --> 01:24:33.234
I didn't have a paycheck anymore.
or health insurance.

1595
01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:36.529
Most importantly. my kids' daycare.

1596
01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:39.699
the roof over our head.
was on the Stanford campus.

1597
01:24:39.783 --> 01:24:41.868
The same school that was my victim.

1598
01:24:41.951 --> 01:24:45.121
[man] Any message to your former athletes?
They looked up to you.

1599
01:24:45.205 --> 01:24:48.541
[Vandemoer] I also made the mistake
leaving my social media on.

1600
01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:50.794
and it's just… hate.

1601
01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:53.046
I got a couple death threats on the phone.

1602
01:24:53.129 --> 01:24:55.131
Anonymous folks sending messages

1603
01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:58.384
that they were upset
at what they thought he did.

1604
01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:02.138
I was the "worst fat fuck"
that they've ever seen in their life.

1605
01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:04.265
"How did I ever fit
in a frickin' sailboat?

1606
01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:06.184
How could I do this to Stanford?

1607
01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:08.394
I should just fucking die and go away."

1608
01:25:08.478 --> 01:25:11.773
The week that it broke.
we got a call from a Chinese guy

1609
01:25:11.856 --> 01:25:14.859
who wanted to pay
$10 million to get into Harvard.

1610
01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:17.946
[chuckling] I was like.
"Man. have you read the news?" Like…

1611
01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:20.198
This is the worst week to make this call.

1612
01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:25.578
When the story broke.
I was getting ready to go into a meeting.

1613
01:25:25.662 --> 01:25:28.289
and I got a call
from a friend of mine. and he says.

1614
01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:34.170
"Hey. who's the guy you worked for
at the getting-into-college company?"

1615
01:25:34.254 --> 01:25:35.880
I said. "Rick Singer. Why?"

1616
01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:38.174
He says. "You gotta be kidding."
I said. "No. why?"

1617
01:25:39.008 --> 01:25:43.221
"Turn on the news. Go on Facebook.
Go on Instagram. Whatever."

1618
01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:46.558
[chuckling] "Just open up your phone
and look."

1619
01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:50.937
And I couldn't believe it.

1620
01:25:55.942 --> 01:25:59.028
There's a videotape
of Rick just walking solemnly

1621
01:25:59.112 --> 01:26:02.448
with all these reporters.
and not looking at anyone.

1622
01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:03.449
and my…

1623
01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:07.036
My heart just sank. It just sank.

1624
01:26:07.745 --> 01:26:09.956
[Vandemoer] Finally.
it was time for me to go in.

1625
01:26:10.039 --> 01:26:11.499
It's my time to be sentenced.

1626
01:26:12.292 --> 01:26:13.710
Rick was still in there.

1627
01:26:13.793 --> 01:26:17.463
We literally
have to cross each other right away.

1628
01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:21.176
Rick. of course. doesn't look
me in the eye or anything else.

1629
01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:22.093
It just. uh…

1630
01:26:22.969 --> 01:26:26.514
I'll never forget that moment
when we walked by each other like that.

1631
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.185
My heart was pounding.

1632
01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:34.105
Um. sitting between my two lawyers
and the judge comes up

1633
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:37.483
and "conspiracy racketeering"
is what I end up pleading guilty to.

1634
01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:40.403
[Fisher] Judge Zobel
understood that this was a guy

1635
01:26:40.486 --> 01:26:42.780
who really cared deeply about his students

1636
01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:45.116
and there was no need to send him to jail.

1637
01:26:45.783 --> 01:26:48.536
[Zobel] Mr. Vandemoer
is probably the least culpable

1638
01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.122
of all of the defendants
in this group of cases.

1639
01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:54.334
Certainly the parents
are in a different position.

1640
01:26:54.417 --> 01:26:57.212
The other coaches
benefitted for themselves.

1641
01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:59.047
He did not do that.

1642
01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:03.176
[Vandemoer] She gave me six months of home
confinement. two years of probation.

1643
01:27:03.259 --> 01:27:05.303
And I got a $10.000 fine.

1644
01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:08.348
I think. for John.
that was truly the right decision.

1645
01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:10.642
And he didn't have to serve time.

1646
01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:13.561
He's home with his kids.
He's bettering himself.

1647
01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:15.772
He's going back to school. He has a job.

1648
01:27:15.855 --> 01:27:19.609
He seems. when I talk to him.
that he's in a much. much better place.

1649
01:27:19.692 --> 01:27:22.278
I believe.
in Stanford's victim impact letter.

1650
01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:27.617
they said they're still in possession
of over $700.000 in donations.

1651
01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:30.411
Neither me or any associates
working for me at the firm

1652
01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:34.540
could find any case where
the victim of a racketeering conspiracy.

1653
01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:38.127
at the end of the conspiracy
ended up $770.000 richer

1654
01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:40.672
than they were
at the beginning of the conspiracy.

1655
01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.179
[Amott] Rick Singer is back in Sacramento.

1656
01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:51.224
He drives around town.
He's still in his athletic clothes.

1657
01:27:51.307 --> 01:27:52.934
He doesn't look any flashier.

1658
01:27:53.017 --> 01:27:56.312
He swims twice a day
at a local tennis club.

1659
01:27:56.396 --> 01:27:58.606
And he gets out of the pool in a Speedo.

1660
01:27:58.690 --> 01:28:00.900
does yoga. push-ups.
and he's on the phone.

1661
01:28:00.984 --> 01:28:02.735
Sometimes he has multiple phones.

1662
01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:06.572
My understanding. he's telling people
that he's not gonna go to jail

1663
01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:08.950
because they know the judge. etcetera.

1664
01:28:09.033 --> 01:28:12.078
Again. knowing Rick Singer.
you don't know what to believe.

1665
01:28:12.161 --> 01:28:15.581
You don't know if he believes it
or if it's an outright lie.

1666
01:28:15.665 --> 01:28:18.209
Um. you know.
he's plead guilty to four felonies.

1667
01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:21.587
I just have to believe
he's going to go to jail.

1668
01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:26.217
[man] Is the system broken?
Any comment on anything?

1669
01:28:27.677 --> 01:28:31.264
[Fry] There's a video
in which you see a guy with a mic

1670
01:28:31.347 --> 01:28:36.185
trying to get Rick Singer to answer
questions. and he just stonewalls them.

1671
01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:40.106
Can any good come out of this. Rick?

1672
01:28:40.606 --> 01:28:45.403
[Fry] He seems unperturbed
by these people trying to interview him.

1673
01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:49.324
It makes you wonder
about the levels of his regret.

1674
01:28:49.407 --> 01:28:54.162
He's a bit of a cipher
in his attitude about this whole affair.

1675
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:58.499
You seem comfortable.
You're taking your time here.

1676
01:29:01.002 --> 01:29:03.755
Did you really work
with over 700 families?

1677
01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.508
Rick. is the system broken?

1678
01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:14.974
[reporter 1] Actress Lori Loughlin
of Full House

1679
01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:16.642
was sentenced to two months in prison.

1680
01:29:16.726 --> 01:29:18.686
[reporter 2] Her husband.
Mossimo Giannulli.

1681
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:20.271
was sentenced to five months.

1682
01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:24.317
[reporter 3] Actress Felicity Huffman
received 14 days behind bars.

1683
01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:28.029
[Kalmus] No good will have come out
of these sentences or out of this scandal.

1684
01:29:28.112 --> 01:29:31.449
The fines they've been given. meaningless.

1685
01:29:31.532 --> 01:29:33.868
In terms of hitting them
in their pocketbook.

1686
01:29:33.951 --> 01:29:37.205
what a difference
it could have made if we hit them hard

1687
01:29:37.288 --> 01:29:40.666
and put that money
to work for underprivileged kids.

1688
01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:42.835
That would have been amazing.

1689
01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:45.922
Then you can say
at least some good came of it.

1690
01:29:46.005 --> 01:29:50.676
I try not to blame
the families or the parents.

1691
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:54.389
I tend to focus
the criticism on the colleges

1692
01:29:54.472 --> 01:29:57.266
and universities that created this system.

1693
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:59.310
If they didn't have these loopholes

1694
01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:02.271
and these preferences
for families of privilege.

1695
01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:05.650
then I don't think there would be
these kind of temptations.

1696
01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:10.655
This scandal is not necessarily a reason
for colleges to change their ways.

1697
01:30:10.738 --> 01:30:15.535
Because it makes the colleges seem
more exclusive and desirable than ever.

1698
01:30:15.618 --> 01:30:19.664
If all these rich people are willing
to go to these incredible lengths

1699
01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:23.376
and risk jail time just
to get their kids into these colleges.

1700
01:30:23.459 --> 01:30:26.462
then they must be extremely valuable.

1701
01:30:26.546 --> 01:30:30.258
What are we doing to these kids
by pounding them into the ground

1702
01:30:30.341 --> 01:30:33.845
with "top 25. top 10. top 5"?

1703
01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:36.681
Because ultimately.
where you do go to school

1704
01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:40.810
has little or no effect
on what will happen to you in the future.

1705
01:30:40.893 --> 01:30:44.147
The United States has over 3.000 colleges.

1706
01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:46.065
You have infinite choices.

1707
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:47.358
Forget about USC.

1708
01:30:48.317 --> 01:30:50.069
Go someplace else.

1709
01:30:50.153 --> 01:30:54.198
You can get a great education
almost any place if you want it.

1710
01:30:54.782 --> 01:30:57.785
The parents
in this case didn't believe that.

1711
01:30:57.869 --> 01:31:00.329
Because the bigger school
had the prestige.

1712
01:31:00.413 --> 01:31:03.833
had the glitter.
had the glamour. had the bragging rights.

1713
01:31:04.917 --> 01:31:09.046
Why did these parents choose to cheat this

1714
01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:11.340
when their children had so much already?

1715
01:31:11.424 --> 01:31:15.470
Part of it seems to be
when you reach a certain level of wealth.

1716
01:31:15.553 --> 01:31:18.389
there's a relentless pursuit
of the trappings of power.

1717
01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:20.016
You wanna have the fancy car.

1718
01:31:20.099 --> 01:31:22.059
the fancy house.
whether you need it or not.

1719
01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:23.561
and it just seems to me

1720
01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:27.523
that the atmosphere
created in high-wealth societies

1721
01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:29.400
is part of the problem.

1722
01:31:30.234 --> 01:31:34.614
In America. we love the wealthy
and we hate the wealthy.

1723
01:31:34.697 --> 01:31:37.408
They disgust us and they fascinate us.

1724
01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:42.788
This story was a perfect
opportunity to see how rich people live

1725
01:31:42.872 --> 01:31:46.083
and the realities
of the system being exposed.

1726
01:31:46.167 --> 01:31:48.586
and so there's something
incredibly refreshing

1727
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:53.382
to have just a little bit of justice
being served in a sea of injustice.

1728
01:34:00.009 --> 01:34:02.845
[Fisher] Rick will be living with this
for quite a while.

1729
01:34:03.512 --> 01:34:06.682
If he didn't cooperate.
he would have been charged.

1730
01:34:06.766 --> 01:34:08.059
maybe convicted already.

1731
01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:11.103
And right now he's out. a free man still.

1732
01:34:11.187 --> 01:34:15.191
And his cooperation won't be complete
until the very last person

1733
01:34:15.274 --> 01:34:17.318
charged in this conspiracy is sentenced.

1734
01:34:17.401 --> 01:34:20.154
and that is most likely
gonna be a while from now.

1735
01:34:42.843 --> 01:34:44.845
