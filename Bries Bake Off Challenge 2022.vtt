You just went back to sleep.

Do you really think those bakes

83
00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:11.394
will sell better than mine?

84
00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.062

85
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.940
- These happen to be the
most amazing brownies ever.

86
00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.650
- Not if they look like that.

87
00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:18.860

88
00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:20.528

- Those look like you
bought them from the store.

90
00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:23.448
- I'm just good at baking

91
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.742
and I'm going to
sell the most today.

92
00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.785

mistake sugar for salt.

93
00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:29.996
- I hope you don't
accidentally drop your bakes.

94
00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:31.581

95
00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:32.832

96
00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:34.042

- Why were you
talking to Vanessa?

101
00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:48.014
- [Brie] She thinks she's
gonna win the bake sale.

102
00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:49.307
- Did you tell her that
it's your grandma's

103
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.808
super secret recipe?

104
00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:52.727
- No. she was too busy
calling them poop.

105
00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.063
- She doesn't know what
she's talking about.

106
00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:56.564
- I know.

107
00:05:56.647 --> 00:05:57.482
Where's your bakes?

108
00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:58.483
- Ms. Melanie had us take some

109
00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.984
to the big fridge already.

110
00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:01.402
You might have to go too.

111
00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.737
- Great.
- What?

112
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.281
- Vanessa said "I hope
you don't accidentally

113
00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:06.199
drop your bakes."

114
00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:07.408
(Millie gasps)

115
00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.951
- [Millie] Oops.

116
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.578
- Is everything
all right. Millie?

117
00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:11.829
- Yeah.

118
00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:14.957
You know. I just got a
whiff of Brie's brownies

119
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:17.126
and they took my breath away.

120
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.960
So good.

121
00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.422
- Brie. why don't you go
to the cafeteria fridge

122
00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.007
where the rest of the bakes are?

123
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.383
- Yes. Ms. Melanie.

124
00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:26.803
- Ms. Melanie. I need
to put mine away too.

125

bakes a safe voyage.

131
00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.775
- [Ms. Melanie] Oh. why
Jody. those look fantastic.

132
00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:44.153
Why don't you go with
the girls to the fridge?

139
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:08.678
Take out your
writing assignments

140
00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.138
and send them to the front.

141
00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.857
- So. who taught
you how to bake?

142
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.691
- My dad's a baker.

143
00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:23.025
- That's so cool.

144
00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.360
My dad's lame.

145
00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:25.570
- Why? What's he do?

146
00:07:25.653 --> 00:07:26.696
- He's...

147
00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:27.488
He. uh...

148
00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:28.614
He's a doctor.

149
00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:30.241
- Oh. he must be really busy.

150
00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:31.033
- Very.

151
00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.703

152
00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:34.745

cream in my backpack.

153
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:35.705

154
00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:38.875

155
00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.127

156
00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:46.048
I'm not really gonna
drop your bakes.

157
00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.967
I'm gonna beat you
fair and square.

158
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.761

have to see then. won't we?

159

163
00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:23.544

164
00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:30.718

Namaste. everyone.

169
00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.199
- [Students] Namaste.

170
00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:58.746
- Now. in honor of
today's bake sale.

171
00:08:58.829 --> 00:09:01.540
and because we have
shorter classes.

172
00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:02.792
I thought it would be fun

173
00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:06.796
for each of us to draw
our favorite desserts.

174
00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:07.964
- Nice.

175
00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:11.592
- Now. here's some
paper to draw on.

176
00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:12.885
Pass those back.

177
00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.642
Now really think about
the feeling you get

178
00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:24.647
when drawing out the
details of your desserts.

179
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.190
Okay?

180
00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:26.941
Splendid.

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:51.716
(bright playful music)

182
00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:43.434
- I am not a cheese wheel!

183
00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:46.979
- Brie. what on earth
are you talking about?

184
00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:48.689
- [Brie] Nothing.

185
00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:50.149
- What's on that piece of paper?

186
00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.361
Brie. show me what's
on that paper.

187
00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.325
Who drew this?

188
00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:01.911
Brie?

189
00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:04.455
Millie?

190
00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:05.873
- I don't know.

191
00:11:05.956 --> 00:11:09.001
- Someone tell me who drew this

192
00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:12.171
or none of you will participate
in the bake sale today.

193
00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:12.963
- What?

194
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:18.135
- One last time.

195
00:11:23.432 --> 00:11:24.350
All right.

196
00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:26.769
I'll tell Ms. Melanie
that each of you

197
00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:28.270
will be waiting in the cafeteria

198
00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:30.064
for your parents to
come and get you.

199
00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:31.982
- It was Vanessa.

200
00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:35.861
- Is this true. Vanessa?

201
00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.571
- Kind of.

202
00:11:37.655 --> 00:11:38.989
- You know better than to
gossip about other people.

203
00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:40.866
especially your classmates.

204
00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:44.161
You're going to the
principal's office.

205
00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:46.288
And let this be a lesson
to the rest of you.

206
00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:50.126
There will absolutely no
name calling of any kind.

207
00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.961
In this classroom or out of it!

208
00:11:55.214 --> 00:11:56.674
- You're such a tattle tale.

209
00:11:56.757 --> 00:11:57.466
- Vanessa!

210
00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.687
(door slams)

211
00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:14.442
The aura in here is
completely tainted.

212
00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.652
Continue working
on your drawings

213
00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:17.570
until the bell rings.

214
00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:20.906
(bright playful music)

215
00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:24.994
(school bell rings)

216
00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:27.955
- I can't believe
you just did that.

217
00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:29.415
- Did you hear
how quiet she was?

218
00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:32.168
- I know. but to call her out

219
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:33.919
in front of everybody?

220
00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:34.879
- [Brie] Mr. Claymore
would've made us

221
00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:36.589
sit out on the bake sale.

222
00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:38.966
- Yeah. but tell him in private

223
00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:43.179
like in a note or after class.

224
00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:45.055
Something else.

225
00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:46.223
- Oh. yeah.

226
00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:47.641
I guess that
would've been better.

227
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.145
- Oh my sweet tart.

228
00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.439
There's Vanessa.

229
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.775
Do you think they'll still
let her in the bake sale?

230
00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:57.943
- [Brie] I don't know.

231
00:12:58.027 --> 00:12:59.320
- I hope not.

232
00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:01.155
- [Brie] Only nice people
should be able to do it.

233
00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:03.782
- Well. if she doesn't.

234
00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:04.867
then we're definitely winning

235
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.952
those tickets to Cosmo Land.

236
00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:07.244
- I don't know.

237
00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:10.915
Jody's pies smelled really good.

238
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:12.875
- Maybe she'll get detention

239
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.044
for like the rest of her life.

240
00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:16.253
- (giggles) Yeah. right.

241
00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:18.589
Wait.

242
00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:21.008
Something's wrong
with your pizza.

243
00:13:21.091 --> 00:13:22.635
- (groans) What the?

244
00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:23.677
- [Brie] Ew.

245
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:25.429
- It's still frozen.

246
00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:26.680
- Go ask for another one.

247
00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:27.473
- BRB.

248
00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:34.146
- [Student] I can't wait
for the bake sale today!

249
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.899
Vanessa's cupcakes
look really pretty.

250
00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:40.152
(students chattering)

251
00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:42.071
- [Student 2] I wanna
try Jody's pies.

252
00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:45.032
- [Student] Yeah.
we'll see who wins.

253
00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:47.451
- Patricia says she
doesn't know what happened.

254
00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:48.410
- [Brie] Weird.

255
00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.828
- So. I just got fruit instead.

256
00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.247
- Well that's healthier

257
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.915
since we've been eating
a lot of sweets lately.

258
00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:53.791
- Yeah. yeah.

259
00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:54.959
At least we get out early today.

260
00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:58.003
I love early dismissal days.

261
00:13:58.087 --> 00:13:59.755
- I cannot wait
to win this thing.

262
00:13:59.838 --> 00:14:00.631
- [Millie] Me too.

263
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:06.512
(playful music)

264
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:11.225
- (sighs) Here we go.

265
00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:13.185
- We got this.

266
00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:21.944
- Millie. Vanessa's in.

267
00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:24.280
- Sugar. we don't got this.

268
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.368
- All right. kids.

269
00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:30.869
Who's ready for the bake sale?

270
00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:33.455
(students cheering)

271
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:34.331
- Mm-mm-mm.

272
00:14:38.586 --> 00:14:40.588
Whoever hired him
deserves a medal.

273
00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:45.467
- Whoever made him
deserves a medal.

274
00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:50.306
- Agreed.

275
00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:00.649
- This is your first bake sale?

276
00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.109
- Yeah.

277
00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:03.235
We didn't do anything like
this at my other school.

278
00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:06.238
Ms. Melanie. I'm
a little concerned

279
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:07.573
about the calorie consumption

280
00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:09.074
that's gonna take
place here today.

281
00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:10.743
- Oh. yes. Me too.

282
00:15:10.826 --> 00:15:11.952
It's an awful lot of sugar

283
00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:13.203
for such small children.

284
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.039
- Yeah.

285
00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:15.247
- I think we're ready to start.

286
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:21.503
(playful music continues)

287
00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.715
(Mr. Claymore sighs)

288
00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:27.384
- Trying to get on
his good side. I see?

289
00:15:27.468 --> 00:15:27.551
- No. it's true.

290
00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:32.723
- You were one of the first
to yay the Bake Off. remember?

291
00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:33.682
- Shh!

292
00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:34.975
I'm trying to listen.

293
00:15:35.059 --> 00:15:36.101
- All right. kids.

294
00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:37.853
Who's ready to
start the bake sale?

295
00:15:37.936 --> 00:15:40.314
(all cheering)

296
00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:42.149
That's the spirit I like to see.

297
00:15:42.232 --> 00:15:44.276
All right. a couple
of reminders.

298
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.112
One. try not to eat all
your bakes at once. okay?

299
00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:48.155
We don't want you
guys going home

300
00:15:48.238 --> 00:15:49.823
with severe stomach pains.

301
00:15:49.907 --> 00:15:51.867
And two. this is the big one.

302
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.535
the top four contestants

303
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:54.536
who sell the most bakes today

304
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.122
will have the
opportunity to compete

305
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:59.249
in our annual Spring
Bake Off Challenge.

306
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:02.127
(all applauding)

307
00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.296
All right. and now
I'm gonna hand it over

308
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.632
to Ms. Melanie for some
more exciting news.

309
00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:09.635
- Thank you. Lester.

310
00:16:10.844 --> 00:16:12.262
Okay.

311
00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:15.474
The winner of this year's
Spring Bake Off Challenge

312
00:16:15.557 --> 00:16:16.392
will win the usual.

313
00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:20.020
four tickets to Cosmo Land

314
00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:22.481
and. new this year.

315
00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:27.486
is $5.000 towards
your college tuition

316
00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:33.158
thanks to our new
corporate sponsor DCBX.

317
00:16:33.242 --> 00:16:37.162
Now DCBX is going to
be providing our school

318
00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:40.082
with the necessary
tools and technology

319
00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:44.169
to create more extracurricular
activities such as these.

320
00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:46.088
- $5.000?

321
00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:48.048
- Oh my great jellybeans.

322
00:16:48.132 --> 00:16:50.300
- Millie. that's enough to
pay for my culinary school.

323
00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:52.428
- Or a new computer
for The Mighty Realm.

324
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.973
- They said it's
for college tuition.

325
00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:57.391
not computer games.

326
00:16:57.474 --> 00:16:59.977
- Oh. I guess it
can go to that too.

327
00:17:01.186 --> 00:17:02.938
- All right. children.

328
00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:07.276
Ready. set. sell those bakes!

329
00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:10.529
(bright upbeat music)

330
00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:13.741
(students chattering)

331
00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:47.691
- How much?

332
00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:48.942
- How much do you think

333
00:17:49.026 --> 00:17:50.527
these delicious
brownies are worth?

334
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:51.737
They have a perfect crust

335
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.239
and an ooey-gooey
surprise in the middle.

336
00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:55.199
- Hmm.

337
00:17:56.658 --> 00:17:57.493
Three tickets.

338
00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:58.786
- Great!

339
00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:00.454
But would you like
another brownie

340
00:18:00.537 --> 00:18:01.997
for just two more tickets?

341
00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:05.125
- That's a great deal.

342
00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:05.918
I'll take it.

343
00:18:07.461 --> 00:18:08.212
Thank you!

344
00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:09.546
- Thank you. Tell your friends.

345
00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:13.675
- I thought you said
just one ticket?

346
00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.677
- I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

347
00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.554
- Dang. you're good.

348
00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:20.015
- Plus my dad taught
me all about upselling.

349
00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:21.767
- Oh.

350
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.019
What's that?

351
00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:29.024
- Here you go.

352
00:18:29.107 --> 00:18:30.275
- Thanks.

353
00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:34.696
Don't forget. #Vanessascupcakes.
#bakesale. #bakes.

354
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.200
#bestcupcakesever. #delicious.

355
00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:38.951
- Got it.

356
00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:40.536
- Tag me @Vanessabakes.

357
00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.498
- (sighs) Social media.

358
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.833
- [Millie] That's brilliant.

359
00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:47.125
- Why didn't we think
of that. Millie?

360
00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:48.460
- I didn't know
you could do that.

361
00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:50.712
Where's your phone?

362
00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:51.797
- I left it at home.

363
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.548
Where's yours?

364
00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:53.549
- Mine's still broken.

365
00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:57.219
- Oh. Millie. you
have a customer.

366
00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:58.178
- Oh. why. hello there.

367
00:18:58.262 --> 00:18:59.388
- Hello.

368
00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:00.389
- [Millie] Would
you like a cookie?

369
00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:01.557
- Duh. How much is it?

370
00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:04.726
- How much do you think
this cookie is worth?

371
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.395
It is baked to perfection

372
00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:08.730
and has ooey-gooey chocolate
chips in the middle.

373
00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.357
- Um. a ticket?

374
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.276
- Um. how about three tickets?

375
00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:13.318
- That's too much.

376
00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:15.153
I said one ticket.

377
00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:16.363
- Two tickets?

378
00:19:16.446 --> 00:19:18.073
- How about I take
my ticket elsewhere?

379
00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:20.993
- For an extra ticket you
could add chocolate on top.

380
00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:24.079
Okay. okay. okay.

381
00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.080
One ticket it is.

382
00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:26.456
- [Jade] Now that's
more like it.

383
00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.667
- Thank you very much.

384
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.418
Come again.

385
00:19:33.547 --> 00:19:35.382
Whew. what a tough customer.

386
00:19:35.465 --> 00:19:36.383
- You handled that well.

387
00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:37.467
- Thanks.

388
00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:38.635
- We would like more
brownies. please.

389
00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:39.970
- [Brie] Great seeing you again.

390
00:19:40.053 --> 00:19:42.222
- Can you give us
a group discount?

391
00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:46.685
- Um. I normally
wouldn't do that

392
00:19:46.768 --> 00:19:49.146
but I'll make an exception.

393
00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:51.565
Instead of three tickets
per brownie. how about two?

394
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.697
- Okay. we can do two.

395
00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:05.203
- These are amazing. Thanks.

396
00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:06.538
- Thank you.

397
00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:08.373
- Pleasure doing
business with you.

398
00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:08.498
- Likewise.

399
00:20:19.384 --> 00:20:21.386
(light music)

400
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:24.389
(children groaning)

401
00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:33.565
- Okay. kids. bake sale is over.

402
00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:34.650
Bakers. please bring
your pencil boxes

403
00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:37.736
over to Ms. Melanie's
station right over here.

404
00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:41.281
- Oh my God. this
pie is so good.

405
00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:42.491
- [Ms. Silvera] Mm-hmm.

406
00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:43.659
- [Ms. Henderson] Who do
you think is gonna win?

407
00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:44.284
- [Ms. Silvera]
Whoever made this pie.

408
00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:45.702
(all chuckle)

409
00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:48.330
- Ms. Henderson!

410
00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:49.915
Ms. Henderson.
- Hi. hi.

411
00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:52.042
- Hi. did you get my text?

412
00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:53.710
- No. I didn't get anything.

413
00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:54.962
- Really? Oh.

414
00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:58.507
I sent it at 11:00
o'clock last night.

415
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.385
- Oh. well I was
probably sleeping.

416
00:21:01.468 --> 00:21:03.845
- Stuart did not understand
the math homework last night.

417
00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.389
- [Stuart] Mom!

418
00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:07.808
- Okay. well yes we
went over it today.

419
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:10.352
- Okay. well just so you know.

420
00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:11.353
Come on. dear.

421
00:21:13.522 --> 00:21:14.523
- You need to
change your number.

422
00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:15.524
- I have. twice.

423
00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:22.406
- Here you go.

424
00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:23.490
- All right. everyone.

425
00:21:23.573 --> 00:21:25.534
we are ready to
announce the winners

426
00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:26.910

00:21:36.086 --> 00:21:36.795
- Congrats. Jody.

431
00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:38.338
Happy you made the cut.

432
00:21:38.422 --> 00:21:40.882

be happy about this.

433
00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:44.219

434

- Second place?

441
00:21:56.356 --> 00:21:57.399
- 52 is a lot.

442
00:21:57.482 --> 00:21:58.650

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:01.069
- And in first place we have-

444
00:22:02.362 --> 00:22:04.364
- Don't say Vanessa.
don't say Vanessa.

445
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:07.117
- Vanessa Weiler
selling 53 tickets!

446
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.161
- Yes!
- Wow. what a close race.

447
00:22:09.244 --> 00:22:09.953
- We should get a recount.

448
00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:10.912
- What?

449
00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:11.997
- What did you just say?

450
00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:12.789
- Oh. me?

451
00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:13.665
Um. nothing.

452
00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:14.791
- You're gonna regret that.

453
00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:16.418
- All right. today's bake sale

454
00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:20.088
helped raise $936
for the school.

455
00:22:20.172 --> 00:22:20.922
That's great.

456
00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:22.299
You four will compete

457
00:22:22.382 --> 00:22:24.760
in our annual Spring
Bake Off Challenge

458
00:22:24.843 --> 00:22:29.097
for a chance to win four tickets
to Cosmo Land and $5.000.

459
00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:31.725
(all applauding)

460
00:22:31.808 --> 00:22:33.393
All right. guys.
let's clean it up.

461
00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:37.689
- Why did I have to
say that. Millie?

462
00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:39.066
- Good question.

463
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:40.942
- I just wanted to
win first place.

464
00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.235
- I mean. you got second.

465
00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:43.612
That's still pretty good.

466
00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:45.489
- Not when Vanessa wins first.

467
00:22:46.573 --> 00:22:47.449
- The important thing

468
00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:48.450
is that we made final four.

469
00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.327
That was our goal.

470
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.204
- That means I'm
only second as good.

471
00:22:52.287 --> 00:22:53.163
- No. that just means Vanessa

472
00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:55.457
had a better marketing strategy.

473
00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.375
- My grandma would not be proud.

474
00:22:57.459 --> 00:22:58.710
- That's a terrible
thing to say.

475
00:22:58.794 --> 00:22:59.628
I'm sure she was
the sweetest lady.

476
00:23:01.546 --> 00:23:03.548
- She was actually kinda mean.

477
00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:04.549
- They all are.

478
00:23:10.138 --> 00:23:11.223
- I'm so sorry. girls.

479
00:23:11.306 --> 00:23:12.557
- Dad. it's 4:37!

480
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:13.809
- I know.

481
00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:15.602
I got distracted
with a phone call.

482
00:23:15.685 --> 00:23:16.561
How'd the bake sale go?

483
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:18.438
- We got in!
- Yes!

484
00:23:18.522 --> 00:23:20.315
I told you girls.

485
00:23:20.398 --> 00:23:21.441
Why the face. Brie?

486
00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:22.651
- I got second.

487
00:23:22.734 --> 00:23:23.902
- That's great. sweetie.

488
00:23:24.986 --> 00:23:26.571
Millie. did you get first then?

489
00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:27.989
- She got third.

490
00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:30.075
- Vanessa got first.

491
00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:31.451
- Vanessa Weiler?

492
00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:32.369
- Yes. Dad.

493
00:23:32.452 --> 00:23:33.537
What other Vanessa is there?

494
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.663
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

495
00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:35.914
Drop the tude. Brie.

496
00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:40.085
You should be happy
you're in the Bake Off.

497
00:23:40.168 --> 00:23:40.794
All right?

498
00:23:42.003 --> 00:23:43.004
Come on.

499
00:23:43.088 --> 00:23:44.589
Let's get you guys home.

500
00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:46.466
- [Millie] Did your dad
really just say tude?

501
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.592
- [Brie] Yeah.

502
00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:50.595
(playful music)

503
00:23:50.679 --> 00:23:51.471
- Hurry up. ladies.

504
00:23:57.644 --> 00:24:00.438
(insects chirping)

505
00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:10.657
Brie. wake up.

506
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.325
- You got drool on
your face. toots.

507
00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:14.494
- Millie. don't call her that.

508
00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:15.745
Brie. finish your homework.

509
00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:18.748
- How can you concentrate?

510
00:24:18.832 --> 00:24:20.667
It's so boring.

511
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.710
- I don't know.

512
00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:23.587
I guess I just really
like the story.

513
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:27.090
- [Jamie] Sweetie. you
have got to cheer up.

514
00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.258
- That's easy for you to say.

515
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:29.843
You're a grown-up.

516
00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:31.303
- Well if you focus
on your homework.

517
00:24:31.386 --> 00:24:33.430
maybe you'll forget
about what happened.

518
00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:35.265
- Oh. can we make
chocolate cake?

519
00:24:35.348 --> 00:24:37.392
- I said focus on homework.

520
00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:39.102
- Actually. can we. Dad?

521
00:24:39.186 --> 00:24:40.395
- You wanna bake more?

522
00:24:40.478 --> 00:24:42.397
- Yeah. like you
say in your book.

523
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.357
I need to vent out my feelings.

524
00:24:44.441 --> 00:24:45.734
- Nice.

525
00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:48.361
- Okay. if it'll
make you feel better.

526
00:24:48.445 --> 00:24:50.363
Just make sure you
finish your homework.

527
00:24:50.447 --> 00:24:51.740
- Thanks. Dad.
- Thanks. Mr. H.

528
00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:53.867
- [Jamie] Call me if
you need anything.

529
00:24:56.953 --> 00:24:57.746
- I'll mix the dry ingredients.

530
00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:58.496
you mix the wet.

531
00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.998
- [Millie] On it.

532
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:02.959
(silverware clattering)

533
00:25:03.043 --> 00:25:05.587
- [Brie] Mm. cocoa
powder smells so good.

534
00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.756
- [Millie] Here's the wet
ingredients for your mix.

535
00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:09.341
- [Brie] I'll butter the pan.

536
00:25:10.258 --> 00:25:11.301
(Peter screams)

537
00:25:11.384 --> 00:25:12.969
- Holy pretzel sticks. Peter!

538
00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:14.554
You made us drop the mix!

539
00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:16.223
- It's all over the floor!

540
00:25:16.306 --> 00:25:17.015
- Dad!

541
00:25:21.144 --> 00:25:21.853
- Are you okay?

542
00:25:21.937 --> 00:25:22.604
What's going on?

543
00:25:22.687 --> 00:25:23.605
What did you guys do?

544
00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:24.814
- Us?

545
00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:26.107
Peter scared us and
made us drop the mix.

546
00:25:26.191 --> 00:25:27.734
- Our cake is ruined.

547
00:25:27.817 --> 00:25:30.111
- Peter Ivan Hayes.
get down here!

548
00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:30.862
- So much for baking a cake.

549
00:25:33.031 --> 00:25:36.618
- Peter. help your
sister clean this up.

550
00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:38.536
Why did you do that?

551
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.871
- I thought it would be funny.

552
00:25:39.955 --> 00:25:41.623
- Well. not today.

553
00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:43.208
You get 30 minutes of time out.

554
00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:44.042
- 30?
- Mm-hmm.

555
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.211
- It should be an hour.

556
00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:47.712
- Or three.

557
00:25:47.796 --> 00:25:47.879
Hundred.

558
00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:51.633
(chuckles) I'm watching you.

559
00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.301
- After you girls clean this up

560
00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:54.552
you can bake another one

561
00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:57.555
while your brother is
upstairs. all right?

562
00:25:57.639 --> 00:26:00.183
- I don't know why we're helping
to clean this up. but okay.

563
00:26:03.645 --> 00:26:05.021
Here's my phone.

564
00:26:05.105 --> 00:26:06.356
- [Millie] Do you think if
you had your phone today

565
00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:07.816
you would've won the bake sale?

566
00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:09.651
- Millie. I don't wanna
think about that right meow.

567
00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:10.443
- Sorry.

568
00:26:12.737 --> 00:26:15.949
(light cheerful music)

569
00:26:17.867 --> 00:26:19.035
(train horn whistling)

570
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.704
- Oh my goodness. this question
doesn't make any sense.

571
00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:21.705
(phone chiming)

572
00:26:21.788 --> 00:26:22.831
- [Millie] Yes!

573
00:26:22.914 --> 00:26:23.748
- [Peter] I wanna
go check the cake!

574
00:26:23.832 --> 00:26:25.083
- No. Peter! You stay.

575
00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:26.501
- [Millie] We don't
want you messing up

576
00:26:26.584 --> 00:26:28.295
our chocolate masterpiece.

577
00:26:28.378 --> 00:26:29.754
- Stay. Peter.

578
00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:29.921
Stay.

579
00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:33.550
Stay.

580
00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:34.342
Ah-ah! Sit!

581
00:26:36.803 --> 00:26:37.679
Good boy.

582
00:26:37.762 --> 00:26:39.806
(spring boinging on TV)

583
00:26:39.889 --> 00:26:41.266
(character laughing on TV)

584
00:26:41.349 --> 00:26:42.017
Hey. Dad.

585
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:42.183
The cakes are ready.

586
00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:45.270
Mm-hmm. Okay.

587
00:26:46.187 --> 00:26:46.896
Bye.

588
00:26:56.156 --> 00:26:56.906
- All ready.

589
00:26:58.783 --> 00:26:59.659
- [Millie] Oh my goodness.
they look so good.

590
00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:01.077
- That looks good. girls.

591
00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:02.746
- It rose perfectly.

592
00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:03.538
- Hello!

593
00:27:03.621 --> 00:27:05.457
Jamie. kids!

594
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.542
Can someone help me with
the groceries. please?

595
00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:08.960
- I'll be right there.

596
00:27:11.504 --> 00:27:12.380
Oh! (laughs)

597
00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:13.673
- Hi. sweetie.
- Hi. honey.

598
00:27:13.757 --> 00:27:14.466
- [Peter] Mommy!

599
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:16.843
- Hello. Peter!

600
00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:17.927
(lips smacking)

601
00:27:18.011 --> 00:27:19.137
- Let me help you with this.

602
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:19.929
- Thank you.

603
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:23.016
Oh. I see you baked again.

604
00:27:23.099 --> 00:27:25.560
- Yeah. but Peter scared
us and made us drop it.

605
00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:27.729
So we made it again.

606
00:27:27.812 --> 00:27:29.689
- Now. Peter. if you're
gonna scare someone.

607
00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:32.650
at least make sure they're not
holding something important.

608
00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:34.778
- Got it.
- Okay. good.

609
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:36.154
- Marcy.

610
00:27:36.237 --> 00:27:36.321
- What?

611
00:27:38.198 --> 00:27:42.243
I mean. Peter. don't
you ever do anything

612
00:27:42.327 --> 00:27:43.912
like that again. okay?

613
00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:45.622
- Okay.
- Okay.

614
00:27:45.705 --> 00:27:47.582
Now go get the groceries.

615
00:27:47.665 --> 00:27:48.375
- Come on. buddy.

616
00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:53.755
- So. I'm assuming you sold
all your brownies today?

617
00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:54.756
- [Brie] No.

618
00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:55.673
- No?

619
00:27:55.757 --> 00:27:56.966
What do you mean no?

620
00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.052
- I got second place.

621
00:27:59.135 --> 00:27:59.177
- Second?

622
00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:02.013
Oh.

623
00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:03.765
Well. at least
you got in. right?

624
00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.558
- [Brie] Yeah. but
Vanessa got first.

625
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:07.811
- Oh.

626
00:28:07.894 --> 00:28:09.354
Vanessa Weiler?

627
00:28:09.437 --> 00:28:10.438
- [Brie] Yeah.

628
00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.357
- [Marcy] Well
what did she make?

629
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.608
- Cupcakes.

630
00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:16.027
- She used social media tactics

631
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:17.445
to market her cupcakes.

632
00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:19.322
- Oh. wow.

633
00:28:19.406 --> 00:28:21.449
Well why didn't you do that?

634
00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:22.450
- I left my phone at home.

635
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.536
- And mine's still broken.

636
00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:25.453
- [Marcy] Well did
she say anything

637
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:26.913
to you afterward?

638
00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:27.038
- [Brie] Uh. no.

639
00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:30.291
- [Millie] Oh. you got donuts.

640
00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:31.751
- Yes. they were on sale.

641
00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:32.919
- [Millie] Where do these go?

642
00:28:33.002 --> 00:28:34.504
- In that cabinet right there.

643
00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:37.966
So what place did
you get. Millie?

644
00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:38.716
- [Millie] Third.

645
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.260
Oh. the winners get more

646
00:28:40.343 --> 00:28:42.470
than just Cosmo Land tickets
if they win this year.

647
00:28:42.554 --> 00:28:43.888
- Oh yeah. what's that?

648
00:28:43.972 --> 00:28:46.057
- $5.000.

649
00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:51.438
- $5.000?

650
00:28:51.521 --> 00:28:52.397
Jamie. did you hear that?

651
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.481
- Yeah. I heard.

652
00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:55.817
Brie. how come you
didn't tell me sooner?

653
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.277
- [Millie] She was
too bust moping.

654
00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.027
- I was not!

655
00:28:59.654 --> 00:29:01.739
- Uh-hmm. Was too.

656
00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:04.117
- Well you two will have a fun
opportunity to bake together.

657
00:29:07.954 --> 00:29:08.163
Who ate a donut?

658
00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:12.876
Peter!

659
00:29:12.959 --> 00:29:13.918
How many times do
I have to tell you

660
00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:15.545
not before dinner?

661
00:29:16.796 --> 00:29:18.006
That boy never listens.

662
00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.674
- Tell me about it.

663
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.553
(goofy music)

664
00:29:26.097 --> 00:29:29.726
(character laughing on TV)

665
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:40.111
(car engine humming)
(dog barking)

666
00:29:55.335 --> 00:29:57.712
- Dad?

667
00:30:17.398 --> 00:30:18.399
Dad?

668
00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:19.901
- [Eugene] Hmm?

669
00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:22.904
- I have some great news.

670
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.369
I got first place

671
00:30:29.452 --> 00:30:30.537
in the bake sale today.

672
00:30:32.121 --> 00:30:33.831
I helped to raise
a bunch of money

673
00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:37.752
and I get to compete

674
00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:40.296
in the Spring Bake Off
Challenge for $5.000.

675
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:45.218
- [Eugene] That's
great. sweetie.

676
00:30:45.301 --> 00:30:45.343
- Yeah.

677
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.888
The Bake Off is in like a month.

678
00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:50.682
So I have to practice some more.

679
00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:55.144
- [Eugene] Who took
you home today?

680
00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:56.854
- Maxine's mom.

681
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:59.649
(microwave beeps)

682
00:31:01.317 --> 00:31:02.110
- Oh. good.

683
00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:27.343
Did you finish your homework?

684
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.554
- Yeah.

685
00:31:31.806 --> 00:31:32.974
- [Man On TV] Perfect.

686
00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:33.266
Are you serious?

687
00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:42.400
There was nothing else. huh?

688
00:31:42.483 --> 00:31:44.193
- Go!
- Stay close.

689
00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:53.161
- That chocolate
cake tastes so good.

690
00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:54.037
- [Jamie] Mm-hmm.

691
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.246
- I'm surprised you had room

692
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.373
after having
seconds and a donut.

693
00:31:57.457 --> 00:32:00.335
- [Peter] I couldn't
help myself.

694
00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.086
- [Brie] Shh. guys!
I'm trying to listen.

695
00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.839
- [Host On TV] Eight years old
from Harrisburg. Pennsylvania

696
00:32:04.922 --> 00:32:06.341
with an IQ of 250

697
00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:09.510
which is way higher
than most Americans.

698
00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:11.471
- I can't believe how
much these kids are.

699
00:32:11.554 --> 00:32:12.263
- Me neither.

700
00:32:12.347 --> 00:32:13.139
(doorbell rings)

701
00:32:13.222 --> 00:32:14.557
- Millie. that is your mom.

702
00:32:14.641 --> 00:32:16.017
Why don't you get your stuff?

703
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.143
- You don't have
to get up. honey.

704
00:32:17.226 --> 00:32:18.436
I'll get it.

705
00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:19.729
- Oh.

706
00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:21.022
Thank you. sweetheart.

707
00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:22.273

708
00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:23.191

709
00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.108
Thanks for dinner. Mrs. H.

711
00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:26.277
Have a nice night. Millie.

00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:27.737
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

713
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.201
- Hey!
- Hi. Barb.

714
00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:34.577
- Thanks for keeping
Millie so late.

715
00:32:34.661 --> 00:32:35.828
- Of course.

716
00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:36.579
- I got caught up
at the hospital.

717
00:32:36.663 --> 00:32:37.747
- It's not a problem.

718
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.540
They finished all their homework

719
00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:41.042
and they baked
another cake today.

720
00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:42.085
- Another cake?
- Mm-hmm.

721
00:32:42.168 --> 00:32:43.336
- Okay. Thank you.

722
00:32:43.419 --> 00:32:44.337
(Jamie laughs)

723
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.296
- What's up. Mamma?

724
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.590
- Congratulations. little star.

725
00:32:47.674 --> 00:32:48.383
- Thanks. Mamma.
- I'm so proud of you

726
00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.093
for getting in.

727
00:32:50.176 --> 00:32:51.969
- Hey. did you hear
about the sponsorship?

728
00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:53.888
- Yeah. Marcy told
me on the phone.

729
00:32:53.971 --> 00:32:56.099
- Yeah. $5.000.
- I know.

730
00:32:56.182 --> 00:32:57.975
- Well. that is exciting.

731
00:32:58.059 --> 00:32:59.018
Well. we'll let you go.

732
00:32:59.102 --> 00:33:00.228
- Of course.

733
00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:01.020
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome.

734
00:33:01.104 --> 00:33:02.063
- Thanks. Mr. H.
- All right.

735
00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:03.314
Have a good night.
- Take care.

736
00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:11.072
- [Host On TV] And
remember. kids.

737
00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:15.118
be smart and keep on studying.

738
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:17.453
This is your hostess
with the mostest.

739
00:33:17.537 --> 00:33:20.415
My name is Leonard Moe.
- All right. you two.

740
00:33:20.498 --> 00:33:21.374
It's time for bed.
- And I will see you

741
00:33:21.457 --> 00:33:22.667
next time.
- Okay.

742
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.252
- All right. go
brush your teeth.

743
00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:26.671
I'll be up in a minute.

744
00:33:26.754 --> 00:33:27.463
- Okay.

745
00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:42.061
(Jamie sighs)

746
00:33:43.312 --> 00:33:44.480
- I'll do the dishes. honey.

747
00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:47.775
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

748
00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:49.277
- You're being
unusually sweet today.

749
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:52.113
What's wrong?

750
00:34:00.037 --> 00:34:02.039
- I haven't got my
advance yet from Grant.

751
00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:03.082
- What?

752
00:34:03.166 --> 00:34:03.875
- I know.

753
00:34:05.168 --> 00:34:07.378
I've been on the phone
with him all day.

754
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:12.216
He said it's gonna be
another couple of months.

755
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.135
- Another couple months?

756
00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.053
Doesn't he know we have
a family to support?

757
00:34:16.137 --> 00:34:17.138
- I told him.

758
00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:19.640
- We're barley making
ends meet on my salary.

759
00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:20.391
- I know.

760
00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:23.227
I feel terrible.

761
00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:25.480
Maybe I should just go
back to a full time.

762
00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:28.733
It's more secure.

763
00:34:30.276 --> 00:34:31.152
- No.

764
00:34:32.361 --> 00:34:33.446
Don't do that.

765
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:36.783
We'll dip into our savings

766
00:34:36.866 --> 00:34:39.494
and just put it back
when you get it.

767
00:34:44.332 --> 00:34:45.374
- I'm sorry. honey.

768
00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:50.296
I waited to tell you
without the kids.

769
00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:52.840
- No. I'm glad you waited.

770
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.053
- I just feel bad.

771
00:34:58.304 --> 00:35:00.723
You're the only one
bringing home the bacon.

772
00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:05.103
Like both food and money.

773
00:35:09.148 --> 00:35:10.399
- Honey. it's fine.

774
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:14.570
We've been in worse places.

775
00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:18.324
I do wanna give Grant

776
00:35:18.407 --> 00:35:19.200
a piece of my mind though.

777
00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:21.285
- I know. It's so frustrating.

778
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:30.795
- [Marcy] She leaves
this thing everywhere.

779
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:35.299
- I just hope my
book sells well.

780
00:35:38.845 --> 00:35:39.554
- It will.

781
00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:42.265
(gentle music)

782
00:35:46.352 --> 00:35:48.896
It'll be all right. honey.

783
00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.482
- Thank you. baby.

784
00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:09.542
(pleasant music)

785
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:15.131
(school bell rings)

786
00:36:31.439 --> 00:36:34.650
(bright playful music)

787
00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:41.657
- [Brie] Vanessa hasn't
said anything to me today.

788
00:36:41.741 --> 00:36:43.201
- [Millie] What?

789
00:36:43.284 --> 00:36:45.828
Oh. I almost forgot she
heard you wanting a recount.

790
00:36:55.212 --> 00:36:56.547
- [Brie] I think she forgot.

791
00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:58.591
I mean. she got first place.

792
00:37:01.677 --> 00:37:03.638
- [Millie] Yeah.
maybe she'll forget

793
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:04.472
all about it just like I did.

794
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:13.940
(Ms. Henderson clears throat)

795
00:37:28.204 --> 00:37:29.997
- [Brie] Exactly. We good.

796
00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:34.585
(whistle blares)
(Vanessa screams)

797
00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:36.545
(upbeat determined music)

798
00:37:36.629 --> 00:37:37.338
- Dip and dodge.

799
00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.297
Here we go. come on.

800
00:37:38.381 --> 00:37:38.714
Bop and weave.

801
00:37:41.884 --> 00:37:42.718
All right. here we go. guys.

802
00:37:42.802 --> 00:37:43.636
Dip and dodge. Dip and dodge.

803
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:47.556
- This doesn't look
very good. Brie.

804
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.016
- I know. just keep dodging.

805
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:50.434
- Burn some calories.

806
00:37:50.518 --> 00:37:51.394
Yep.

807
00:37:53.771 --> 00:37:54.814
You call that a throw?

808
00:37:55.982 --> 00:37:56.857
Use your tricep.

809
00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.317
Get your shoulders into it.

810
00:37:58.401 --> 00:37:59.110
Come on.

811
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:41.986
- Mr. Lester said no head shots.

812
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.778
- Oops.

813
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:46.991
- [Millie] Mr. Lester!

814
00:38:56.542 --> 00:38:59.378
- You can do it.
Brie. Grab a ball.

815
00:39:11.807 --> 00:39:12.975
- Brie. what are you...

816
00:39:13.059 --> 00:39:14.435
Don't hide behind
other kids. no.

817
00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:15.811
Use your instincts. come on.

818
00:39:23.402 --> 00:39:28.324
(bone crunching)
(Brie screams)

819
00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:33.579
- I'm sorry. Mr. Winters.
but you signed the contract.

820
00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:38.459
The Montgomery Ballroom was
never available on the 26th.

821
00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:39.418
Yes.

822
00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:41.962
As I told you before.

823
00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:43.923
another event has booked it.

824
00:39:44.006 --> 00:39:46.467
The other option is
the Hartford Ballroom.

825
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.718
It's similar in size

826
00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.386
but at the opposite
end of the hotel.

827
00:39:51.555 --> 00:39:53.390
I understand that. sir. but...

828
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:56.102
No.

829
00:40:00.815 --> 00:40:00.898
Yes.

830
00:40:03.818 --> 00:40:05.277
All right.

831
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:06.112
Have a good day.

832
00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:12.076
(Marcy sighs)

833
00:40:12.159 --> 00:40:14.286
Brie. you heard what
the doctor said.

834
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:16.163
It's just a small fracture.

835
00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.915
- Mom. the Bake
Off is next month.

836
00:40:17.998 --> 00:40:18.999
How am I supposed to practice?

837
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.961
- Brie. you are a
wonderful baker.

838
00:40:22.044 --> 00:40:23.587
You have great instincts.

839
00:40:23.671 --> 00:40:25.589
- [Brie] Instinct
is what got me here.

840
00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:27.049
- What are you talking about?

841
00:40:27.133 --> 00:40:29.802
- Mr. Lester told me to use
my instincts in gym class

842
00:40:29.885 --> 00:40:31.387
and what do I do?

843
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.389
I hide behind Jeremy
thinking I would be safe.

844
00:40:33.472 --> 00:40:34.473
And what happened?

845
00:40:34.557 --> 00:40:35.850
I get squashed.

846
00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:38.644
I should've just taken a
dodge ball to the face.

847
00:40:38.727 --> 00:40:40.062
- To the face?

848
00:40:40.146 --> 00:40:42.606
Why would you take a
dodge ball to the face?

849
00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.817
- Um. that was
just an expression.

850
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.861
- What did you mean by that?

851
00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:47.027
- I...

852
00:40:48.988 --> 00:40:49.613
Well...

853
00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:51.240
- Brie Alexandra Hayes.

854
00:40:51.323 --> 00:40:54.493
why would you take a
dodge ball to the face?

855
00:40:54.577 --> 00:40:55.828
- Vanessa was kind of attacking

856
00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:57.955
me and Millie with her friends.

857
00:40:58.038 --> 00:40:58.789
- What?

858
00:40:58.873 --> 00:41:00.749
Brie. why didn't you tell me?

859
00:41:02.334 --> 00:41:04.253
I can't believe this
is happening again.

860
00:41:05.254 --> 00:41:06.380
I should call the principle.

861
00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:07.673
- No.

862
00:41:07.756 --> 00:41:09.258
I'm sure she didn't
mean to hit Jeremy

863
00:41:09.341 --> 00:41:11.218
and have him fall on me
and then break my arm.

864
00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.511
It just happened.

865
00:41:12.595 --> 00:41:14.138
- Brie. it is not okay

866
00:41:14.221 --> 00:41:15.639
that she keeps targeting you.

867
00:41:15.723 --> 00:41:16.432
It's also not okay

868
00:41:16.515 --> 00:41:18.100
for you to stick up for her.

869
00:41:18.184 --> 00:41:21.729
Now I know you used to be
best friends in Kindergarten

870
00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:24.982
before. well. you know.

871
00:41:25.065 --> 00:41:27.651
But this is just ridiculous.

872
00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:28.736
I should call her father.

873
00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:30.863
- Mom. please stop!
I'm handling it.

874
00:41:30.946 --> 00:41:33.574
- Not if you come home with
a broken arm. you aren't.

875
00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:34.825
I can't believe
you never told me

876
00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:36.076
that Vanessa was there.

877
00:41:37.411 --> 00:41:38.704
Oh.

878
00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:41.373
Is that why Millie had a
bruise on her forehead?

879
00:41:41.457 --> 00:41:42.333
- Yep.

880
00:41:42.416 --> 00:41:43.876
Dodge ball right to the face.

881
00:41:43.959 --> 00:41:45.586
It was not pretty.

882
00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.296
But that's why I didn't tell you

883
00:41:47.379 --> 00:41:48.672
because I knew you would
make a big deal out of it.

884
00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:51.175
- Because it is a big deal.

885
00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:54.637
Now. Brie. as your mother.
you are my responsibility

886
00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.846
and right now you're
not safe in school.

887
00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.599
- I've just gotta win
the Bake Off. Mom.

888
00:41:58.682 --> 00:41:59.642
Then I can prove to her

889
00:41:59.725 --> 00:42:01.352
that she's not better than me.

890
00:42:01.435 --> 00:42:03.646
Please don't call her
dad or the principal

891
00:42:03.729 --> 00:42:04.813
or anyone else.

892
00:42:04.897 --> 00:42:06.106
It's embarrassing

893
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.733
and it's just gonna
make things worse.

894
00:42:10.819 --> 00:42:13.489
- You really don't
want me to do anything?

895
00:42:13.572 --> 00:42:15.616
- Just help me win
the Bake Off. please.

896
00:42:18.744 --> 00:42:20.287
- All right.

897
00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:22.206
If that's what you want.

898
00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:25.834
But. Brie. if Vanessa
threatens you.

899
00:42:25.918 --> 00:42:27.127
if she makes fun of you

900
00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:29.672
or so far as puts
a finger on you.

901
00:42:29.755 --> 00:42:30.965
you better tell me.

902
00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:31.757
You got that?

903
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.925
- Yes. Mom.

904
00:42:33.008 --> 00:42:34.551
- [Marcy] Okay. good.

905
00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:35.803
- Thanks. Mom.

906
00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:37.513
- You're welcome.

907
00:42:37.596 --> 00:42:40.599
I am gonna push you really
hard to win this thing.

908
00:42:40.683 --> 00:42:41.684
- Good.

909
00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:43.602
- This weekend.

910
00:42:43.686 --> 00:42:45.729
it's on.

911
00:42:45.813 --> 00:42:46.563
- Can't wait.

912
00:42:46.647 --> 00:42:49.441
(cheerful music)

913
00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:56.573
- Ready. and mix!

914
00:42:57.783 --> 00:42:58.867
Come on. guys!

915
00:42:58.951 --> 00:42:59.034
Faster!

916
00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:01.787
You call that mixing?

917
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.163
Let's see those spoons move!

918
00:43:04.331 --> 00:43:05.666
30 seconds left.

919
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:08.836
Ready.

920
00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:11.046
set.

921
00:43:13.882 --> 00:43:14.675
go.

922
00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:17.386
(bright music)

923
00:43:25.644 --> 00:43:26.395
- Yes!

924
00:43:26.478 --> 00:43:27.187
- 16 seconds.

925
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.445
49 seconds.

926
00:43:34.528 --> 00:43:35.696
- Fudge popsicle sticks!

927
00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:36.947
(bell dings)

928
00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:38.615
- Come on. ladies.
Push yourselves.

929
00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:39.408
Hustle. hustle.

930
00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:40.492
You can do it. let's go!

931
00:43:40.576 --> 00:43:42.661
- Why are we doing abs. Mrs. H?

932
00:43:42.745 --> 00:43:44.371
- Don't question me. young lady.

933
00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:45.289
- Yes. ma'am.

934
00:43:45.372 --> 00:43:47.207
Brie. why are we doing abs?

935
00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:48.584
- I don't know.
(timer beeps)

936
00:43:48.667 --> 00:43:50.002
- All right. ladies.

937
00:43:50.085 --> 00:43:51.420
That's enough for today.

938
00:43:51.503 --> 00:43:53.005
Tomorrow we practice
taking cakes

939
00:43:53.088 --> 00:43:54.465
out of the oven without a timer.

940
00:43:54.548 --> 00:43:55.799
- We're doing more tomorrow?

941
00:43:55.883 --> 00:43:56.759
- I'm exhausted.

942
00:43:56.842 --> 00:43:57.968
- Yes.

943
00:43:58.052 --> 00:43:59.803
You know I have
to work all week.

944
00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:01.638
Ladies. we are three weeks away.

945
00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:03.223
It's time to hustle.

946
00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.893
- I'm gonna hustle my way to
the living room so I can relax.

947
00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:06.810
Come on. Millie.

948
00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:09.271
(playful music)

949
00:44:09.355 --> 00:44:10.522
- You're welcome.

950
00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:11.065
- Thanks. Mom.
- Thanks. Mrs. H.

951
00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:17.863
Your mom's hardcore.

952
00:44:17.946 --> 00:44:19.365
- Yeah. she's crazy.

953
00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:21.241
- [Millie] You did
really good today.

954
00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.159
- Not really.

955
00:44:22.242 --> 00:44:24.578
I'm still slow at everything.

956
00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:25.496
- You just need to strengthen

957
00:44:25.579 --> 00:44:26.997
your good arm a little more.

958
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:28.540
That's all.

959
00:44:28.624 --> 00:44:30.751
- [Brie] I don't think I should
be in the Bake Off anymore.

960
00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:32.378
- Don't say that. Brie.

961
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:34.338
- Millie. my arm is broken.

962
00:44:34.421 --> 00:44:36.840
I'm super slow. and you're
doing better than me.

963
00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:38.050
You should just win it

964
00:44:38.133 --> 00:44:39.593
and take me to
Cosmo Land with you.

965
00:44:39.676 --> 00:44:41.595
- Doesn't your
cast come off soon?

966
00:44:41.678 --> 00:44:42.388
- Yeah.

967
00:44:47.476 --> 00:44:49.937
- Maybe I should go.

968
00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.105
- I'm sorry.

969
00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:53.273
I'm just not in a
chipper mood right now.

970
00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:54.942
- Okay.

971
00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:55.943
Can I borrow your phone?

972
00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:57.361
I'll call my mom.

973
00:44:57.444 --> 00:44:58.153
- [Brie] Yeah.

974
00:45:04.243 --> 00:45:06.286
(phone ringing)

975
00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.163
- Hi. Mom. Can you
pick me up meow?

976
00:45:08.247 --> 00:45:09.957
We're done practicing.

977
00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.583
Yeah. we're done practicing.

978
00:45:12.709 --> 00:45:13.419
Okay.

979
00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:15.838
Okay.

980
00:45:15.921 --> 00:45:16.880
Okay. Mom.

981
00:45:16.964 --> 00:45:18.132
Love you. Bye.

982
00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:19.675
Bye.

983
00:45:19.758 --> 00:45:20.926
Bye.

984
00:45:21.009 --> 00:45:21.844
Okay. bye.

985
00:45:22.761 --> 00:45:23.137
She'll be here in 15.

986
00:45:33.105 --> 00:45:35.107
So. what did you end up
painting for art class?

987
00:45:37.025 --> 00:45:37.943
- What are you talking about?

988
00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:40.737
- We have final
paintings due on Monday.

989
00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:41.780
- What?

990
00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:42.698
- Yeah.

991
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:44.199
Remember he said it when...

992
00:45:44.283 --> 00:45:45.492
You know what?

993
00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:46.702
You had your doctor's
appointment that day.

994
00:45:46.785 --> 00:45:47.911
- Millie. why didn't
you remind me?

995
00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:49.496
- I thought I told you.

996
00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.623
Remember on Friday Mr.
Claymore was all like.

997
00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:53.834
"Don't forget finals
are due on Monday."

998
00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:54.751
You were there.

999
00:45:54.835 --> 00:45:56.503
- I don't remember that.

1000
00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:57.421
- You know what?

1001
00:45:57.504 --> 00:45:58.422
You went to the bathroom.

1002
00:45:58.505 --> 00:46:00.090
Completely missed it.

1003
00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:01.675
What are the chances of that?

1004
00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:02.843
- How am I supposed
to make a painting

1005
00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.094
with a broken arm?

1006
00:46:04.178 --> 00:46:05.637
- You've been doing okay
with your other arm.

1007
00:46:05.721 --> 00:46:08.432
- How am I supposed to
make a painting in one day?

1008
00:46:08.515 --> 00:46:09.183
- I got it.

1009
00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:10.350
Just make it abstract.

1010
00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:11.935
You'll totally get an A.

1011
00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:13.312
Once I went to an art museum

1012
00:46:13.395 --> 00:46:15.939
and saw a painting
of a line in a square

1013
00:46:16.023 --> 00:46:17.524
worth millions.

1014
00:46:17.608 --> 00:46:19.026
I still don't get it.

1015
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:20.152
- I was with you that day.

1016
00:46:20.235 --> 00:46:22.070
- Oh. yeah. Wasn't it fun?

1017
00:46:22.154 --> 00:46:23.322
- Who are you?

1018
00:46:23.405 --> 00:46:25.032
(playful music)

1019
00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:28.285
(students chattering)
(school bell rings)

1020
00:46:28.368 --> 00:46:29.077
- [Student] I was
trying to draw bushes

1021
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:29.995
and then I gave up.

1022
00:46:30.078 --> 00:46:31.413
So I drew some random stripes.

1023
00:46:31.497 --> 00:46:33.415
- [Student 2] It looks
like Teletubbies.

1024
00:46:33.499 --> 00:46:36.001
- [Student] I think this is
supposed to be grape juice.

1025
00:46:36.084 --> 00:46:39.171
Lemons. orange juice.
and strawberries.

1026
00:46:41.048 --> 00:46:41.757
- Wow.

1027
00:46:43.008 --> 00:46:45.677
I see some very great
pieces of artwork

1028
00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:47.679
in front of me today.

1029
00:46:47.763 --> 00:46:49.515
Vanessa. why don't you go first?

1030
00:46:49.598 --> 00:46:51.892
- I don't have mine
today. Mr. Claymore.

1031
00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:52.935
- What happened?

1032
00:46:53.018 --> 00:46:55.020
- I. uh. left it at home.

1033
00:46:58.023 --> 00:46:59.274
- Okay.

1034
00:46:59.358 --> 00:47:02.903
Well. that'll be minus
five points for tardiness.

1035
00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.196
Brie. how about you next?

1036
00:47:06.865 --> 00:47:08.742
Come on. don't be shy.

1037
00:47:12.204 --> 00:47:16.291
- Um. so I did something
a little different.

1038
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.339
When I thought about my happy
place I thought of the park.

1039
00:47:22.422 --> 00:47:23.131
So...

1040
00:47:25.092 --> 00:47:26.301
(Mr. Claymore gasps)

1041
00:47:26.385 --> 00:47:27.553
- Oh my.

1042
00:47:28.595 --> 00:47:29.471
Brie!

1043
00:47:29.555 --> 00:47:30.430
- I'm sorry.
- No!

1044
00:47:32.057 --> 00:47:35.477
You really went out of your
way to express yourself here.

1045
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:37.813
- Yeah. I did.

1046
00:47:37.896 --> 00:47:39.314
- [Mr. Claymore]
Which arm did you use?

1047
00:47:39.398 --> 00:47:41.900
- Well. I started out
with my broken arm

1048
00:47:41.984 --> 00:47:43.735
but that didn't go so well.

1049
00:47:43.819 --> 00:47:45.654
So mainly my left arm.

1050
00:47:45.737 --> 00:47:47.489
- Very good.

1051
00:47:48.407 --> 00:47:51.326
I can really sense the struggle

1052
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:54.746
within yourself
in this painting.

1053
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:55.956
Excellent work.

1054
00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:58.041
A round of applause for Brie.

1055
00:47:58.125 --> 00:48:01.253
(students applauding)

1056
00:48:02.462 --> 00:48:05.966
(exhales deeply)
Campbell. you're next.

1057
00:48:06.049 --> 00:48:08.010
Okay. has everyone had
a chance to present?

1058
00:48:08.093 --> 00:48:09.678
(school bell rings)

1059
00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:11.096
There's the bell.

1060
00:48:11.179 --> 00:48:13.849
Okay. excellent work
today. everyone.

1061
00:48:13.932 --> 00:48:16.685
Vanessa. can I see
you for a moment?

1062
00:48:18.103 --> 00:48:18.812
- I got it.

1063
00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:20.897
- You sure?

1064
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:21.690
- Mm-hmm. yeah.

1065
00:48:23.108 --> 00:48:25.277
I'll see you in the cafeteria.

1066
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:25.402
- Okay.

1067
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:38.248
- [Brie] Hey.

1068
00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:39.207
- What do you want?

1069
00:48:41.043 --> 00:48:43.003
- My mom almost
called your dad today.

1070
00:48:43.086 --> 00:48:44.004
- Figures.

1071
00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:46.173
He wouldn't have
answered anyway.

1072
00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:47.716
- [Brie] Well. I
just wanted to say-

1073
00:48:47.799 --> 00:48:48.508
- I gotta go.

1074
00:48:55.515 --> 00:48:56.892
- I got the baked
potato and sides today.

1075
00:48:56.975 --> 00:48:59.019
No more frozen pizza for me.

1076
00:48:59.102 --> 00:49:00.979
- Yeah. that was pretty gross.

1077
00:49:01.063 --> 00:49:02.105
- Yeah.

1078
00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:04.149
Did you talk to Vanessa?

1079
00:49:04.232 --> 00:49:06.234
- No. she just stormed off.

1080
00:49:06.318 --> 00:49:07.944
- (sighs) Typical.

1081
00:49:08.028 --> 00:49:09.655
At least you tried.

1082
00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:10.614
- Yeah.

1083
00:49:10.697 --> 00:49:12.449
- Are you gonna tell your mom?

1084
00:49:12.532 --> 00:49:13.241
- No.

1085
00:49:16.411 --> 00:49:17.287
- [Millie] Ugh!

1086
00:49:17.371 --> 00:49:18.080
- What?

1087
00:49:18.163 --> 00:49:19.289
- It's as hard as a rock.

1088
00:49:20.666 --> 00:49:21.583
(Brie laughs)

1089
00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:23.168
- Dude.

1090
00:49:23.251 --> 00:49:25.045
You have got to start
packing your own lunches.

1091
00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:27.839
- I know but my mom never
has time in the morning.

1092
00:49:27.923 --> 00:49:29.591
- Can't you pack your own?

1093
00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:31.802
- Oh.

1094
00:49:31.885 --> 00:49:33.387
I guess that's a
better solution.

1095
00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:38.308
- So are you gonna
get another potato?

1096
00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:40.769
- No. I'll just eat the sides.

1097
00:49:40.852 --> 00:49:42.312
- Here you go.

1098
00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:44.189
- Oh. thanks.

1099
00:49:45.065 --> 00:49:46.274
So do you know what recipe

1100
00:49:46.358 --> 00:49:47.609
you're gonna use
for the Bake Off?

1101
00:49:47.693 --> 00:49:49.069
I have no idea.

1102
00:49:49.152 --> 00:49:50.821
- Yeah. I think a few online.

1103
00:49:50.904 --> 00:49:52.197
- [Millie] Ooh. what is it?

1104
00:49:53.407 --> 00:49:55.867
- I don't know if
I should tell you.

1105
00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:57.077
- I'm not gonna copy you.

1106
00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.286
- [Brie] Oh yeah. I know.

1107
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:00.080
I just don't think we
should tell each other.

1108
00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:02.332
- But we're BFF's and we
tell each other everything.

1109
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.087
- Yeah. but we're
kinda competing
against each other. so.

1110
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.004
- I was gonna tell you mine

1111
00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:09.965
once I figured it out.

1112
00:50:10.048 --> 00:50:11.258
- I don't wanna know yours.

1113
00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:13.218
- Brie. do you even
think you telling me

1114
00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:15.095
is gonna change anything?

1115
00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:17.264
- I mean. it could.

1116
00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:19.599
You could change yours
after I tell you mine.

1117
00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:20.434
- Wow.

1118
00:50:20.517 --> 00:50:21.226
You know what?

1119
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:22.769
You're right.

1120
00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.646
We shouldn't talk about the
recipes or the Bake Off.

1121
00:50:25.689 --> 00:50:27.315
Or at all.

1122
00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:28.608
- Millie!

1123
00:50:30.569 --> 00:50:31.862
Millie. I didn't mean to...

1124
00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:34.281
(soft music)

1125
00:50:38.493 --> 00:50:40.495
(insects chirping)

1126
00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:48.003
- Do you know where
the donuts are?

1127
00:50:48.086 --> 00:50:50.046
- You ate them all. remember?

1128
00:50:50.130 --> 00:50:51.256
- Dang it.

1129
00:50:51.339 --> 00:50:52.799
I thought I had one more left.

1130
00:50:54.259 --> 00:50:56.136
What you baking now?

1131
00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:57.512
- A lavender vanilla cake.

1132
00:50:57.596 --> 00:50:59.097
Are you gonna make
me spill it again?

1133
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:01.183
- No. not today.

1134
00:51:01.266 --> 00:51:03.059
What's lavender? No chocolate?

1135
00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:04.519
- No. and it's a flower thingy.

1136
00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:07.355
- [Peter] Oh.

1137
00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:08.648
Can you put chocolate on it?

1138
00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:10.650
- I can but I won't.

1139
00:51:10.734 --> 00:51:11.943
- Why not?

1140
00:51:12.027 --> 00:51:14.112
- Because the recipe
doesn't call for it!

1141
00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:16.072
- Okay. sheesh.

1142
00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:17.574
What's up with you today?

1143
00:51:17.657 --> 00:51:18.408
- Nothing!

1144
00:51:18.492 --> 00:51:19.409
Now go away.

1145
00:51:21.203 --> 00:51:21.495
Bye. Leave. go.

1146
00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.384
(timer dings)

1147
00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:41.640
- Hey. sweet pea.

1148
00:51:41.723 --> 00:51:43.141
- [Brie] Hey. Dad.

1149
00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:45.769
- [Jamie] Wow. that looks good.

1150
00:51:45.852 --> 00:51:46.728
- Thank you.

1151
00:51:48.563 --> 00:51:49.231
All done.

1152
00:51:49.314 --> 00:51:50.190
Do you wanna try some?

1153
00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:51.983
- Uh. yeah. I'll have some.

1154
00:51:52.067 --> 00:51:53.860
Peter. you want some cake?

1155
00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:55.821
- [Brie] This is a new
recipe I found online.

1156
00:51:55.904 --> 00:51:56.738
- Looks great.
- Yes!

1157
00:51:56.822 --> 00:51:58.198
(Brie and Jamie chuckles)

1158
00:51:58.281 --> 00:52:00.200
- Oh. that looks so good.

1159
00:52:01.243 --> 00:52:02.077
Oh. wow.

1160
00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:02.869
Okay. for you.

1161
00:52:04.538 --> 00:52:05.413
- Thank you.

1162
00:52:05.497 --> 00:52:06.998
- All right. here we go. ready?

1163
00:52:07.082 --> 00:52:09.209
Uno. dos. three.

1164
00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:13.046
Hmm.

1165
00:52:14.172 --> 00:52:15.048
(Jamie coughs)

1166
00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:16.216
That's um-

1167
00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:18.760
- Nasty. I don't like it.

1168
00:52:18.844 --> 00:52:20.846
- Maybe I added
too much lavender?

1169
00:52:20.929 --> 00:52:21.638
- Yeah.

1170
00:52:21.721 --> 00:52:23.056
Yeah.

1171
00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:24.140
It's a little too-

1172
00:52:24.224 --> 00:52:25.350
- Gross.

1173
00:52:25.433 --> 00:52:27.686
- I was going to say floral.

1174
00:52:27.769 --> 00:52:30.105
- Maybe you should
take out the lavender

1175
00:52:30.188 --> 00:52:32.816
and add chocolate instead.

1176
00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:35.068
- But this recipe got
so many good reviews.

1177
00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:36.486
Maybe I messed it up somehow.

1178
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.071
- [Jamie] Why don't
you ask your mom?

1179
00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:39.865
- [Brie] Oh yeah. she
has a bunch. doesn't she?

1180
00:52:39.948 --> 00:52:41.116
- Yeah.

1181
00:52:41.199 --> 00:52:42.242
And she'll be picking
you up tomorrow

1182
00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:43.910
for your doctor's appointment.

1183
00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:45.370
- I thought you were taking me.

1184
00:52:45.453 --> 00:52:47.414
- Yeah. I have a call I
have to deal with now.

1185
00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:48.915
- Okay.
- Wait.

1186
00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:51.293
You're getting out
early tomorrow?

1187
00:52:51.376 --> 00:52:52.419
- Yep.

1188
00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.045
I can't wait to get
rid of this thing.

1189
00:52:54.129 --> 00:52:55.881
- [Jamie] Well your mom
should be home soon.

1190
00:52:55.964 --> 00:52:57.173
- [Brie] Okay.

1191
00:52:57.257 --> 00:52:58.174
- Here. let me help
you clean this up.

1192
00:52:58.258 --> 00:52:59.301
Give me that

1193
00:52:59.384 --> 00:53:00.093
and that.

1194
00:53:00.176 --> 00:53:00.886
All right.

1195
00:53:03.054 --> 00:53:04.639
- [Peter] Get that outta here.

1196
00:53:04.723 --> 00:53:07.392
(Brie chuckles)

1197
00:53:07.475 --> 00:53:08.643
- Mom?

1198
00:53:08.727 --> 00:53:10.228
- Yeah. sweetie?

1199
00:53:10.312 --> 00:53:11.521
- Do you have any recipes
I can use for the Bake Off?

1200
00:53:13.565 --> 00:53:15.609
- I'm sorry. What?

1201
00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:17.110
- [Brie] Do you have
any recipes I can use

1202
00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:18.778
to practice with
for the Bake Off?

1203
00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:20.280
- Oh yeah. of course.

1204
00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:21.656
I completely forgot about those.

1205
00:53:23.658 --> 00:53:25.660
I'm trying to think
where I put them though.

1206
00:53:29.289 --> 00:53:31.124
- Is everything okay with work?

1207
00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:31.958
- Yes.

1208
00:53:33.335 --> 00:53:34.377
I'm just finishing up

1209
00:53:34.461 --> 00:53:36.171
a couple last
minute things here.

1210
00:53:36.254 --> 00:53:38.089
They should be in the kitchen.

1211
00:53:38.173 --> 00:53:38.882
Let's go.

1212
00:53:47.474 --> 00:53:47.641
Let's see.

1213
00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:59.069
Oh. here they are.

1214
00:54:04.866 --> 00:54:06.743
- [Brie] Whoa. these
recipes are in cursive.

1215
00:54:06.826 --> 00:54:09.037
- [Marcy] Yeah. old
school handwriting.

1216
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.830
- I don't know how
to write in cursive.

1217
00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.165
- Are you serious?

1218
00:54:12.248 --> 00:54:13.583
They're not teaching
you that in school?

1219
00:54:13.667 --> 00:54:14.334
- Nope.

1220
00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:15.752
Well. just my name.

1221
00:54:15.835 --> 00:54:15.919
- Wow.

1222
00:54:18.505 --> 00:54:20.131
Oh. here.

1223
00:54:20.215 --> 00:54:22.300
This one's my favorite.

1224
00:54:22.384 --> 00:54:25.011
- Black forest gateo...

1225
00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:27.013
- Black forest gateaux.

1226
00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:29.349
It has chocolate
and cherries and...

1227
00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:31.559
Oh. it is so good.

1228
00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:33.061
- Thank you.

1229
00:54:33.144 --> 00:54:34.729
- This one will definitely
impress the judges.

1230
00:54:34.813 --> 00:54:35.689
- Thanks. Mom.

1231
00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.315
Can we practice this tomorrow?

1232
00:54:37.399 --> 00:54:39.317
- Yeah. sure.
That'll be perfect.

1233
00:54:39.401 --> 00:54:41.611
You wanna invite Millie
along to practice too?

1234
00:54:41.695 --> 00:54:44.447
- Um. we're not really
talking right now.

1235
00:54:44.531 --> 00:54:45.365
- [Marcy] Sweetie. why?

1236
00:54:45.448 --> 00:54:46.533
- Because I wouldn't tell her

1237
00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:48.284
what I was making
for the Bake Off.

1238
00:54:48.368 --> 00:54:50.203
- Well that seems unfair of her

1239
00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:52.080
and for the rest of the
kids in the Bake Off.

1240
00:54:52.163 --> 00:54:52.998
- That's what I was thinking.

1241
00:54:53.081 --> 00:54:54.499
- Well did you tell her that?

1242
00:54:54.582 --> 00:54:56.501
- No. she just stormed off.

1243
00:54:56.584 --> 00:54:57.627
- Well. I'm sure
she'll understand

1244
00:54:57.711 --> 00:54:59.504
as soon as you talk to her.

1245
00:54:59.587 --> 00:55:00.463
- Yeah.

1246
00:55:02.757 --> 00:55:05.010
This recipe looks
really hard. Mom.

1247
00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:06.386
- I know you can do it.

1248
00:55:08.596 --> 00:55:09.514
- I hope so.

1249
00:55:10.598 --> 00:55:13.768
- Well. let's leave these here.

1250
00:55:13.852 --> 00:55:14.936
It's getting late.

1251
00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.022
And let's get ready for bed.

1252
00:55:17.105 --> 00:55:18.398
- [Brie] Okay. Thanks. Mamma.

1253
00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:18.690
- Oh. you're welcome.

1254
00:55:24.487 --> 00:55:27.073
(birds chirping)

1255
00:55:28.074 --> 00:55:29.743
(gentle music)

1256
00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:41.379
- 9:37?

1257
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:44.090
Dad!

1258
00:55:44.174 --> 00:55:44.883
Mom!

1259
00:55:49.721 --> 00:55:50.597
Dad!

1260
00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.556
Why didn't you wake me?

1261
00:55:51.639 --> 00:55:52.432
I'm gonna be late for school!

1262
00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:54.309
- Sweetie. everything is fine.

1263
00:55:54.392 --> 00:55:56.519
You don't have school today.

1264
00:55:56.603 --> 00:55:57.854
- What? How come?

1265
00:55:57.937 --> 00:55:59.606
- Well. there was a fire

1266
00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:00.607
in your school last night.

1267
00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:01.941
- A fire?

1268
00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:02.692
What happened?

1269
00:56:02.776 --> 00:56:03.610
Did anyone get hurt?

1270
00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:05.528
- Thankfully nobody got hurt.

1271
00:56:05.612 --> 00:56:06.863
But apparently the ovens

1272
00:56:06.946 --> 00:56:09.157
never fully shut off like
they were supposed to

1273
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:10.658
and. well. exploded
in the kitchen.

1274
00:56:10.742 --> 00:56:11.826
- Exploded?

1275
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:13.536
- Luckily the kitchen
has metal doors

1276
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.747
so the fire was
somewhat contained.

1277
00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:18.041
I read the rest of
the cafeteria is fine.

1278
00:56:19.125 --> 00:56:20.376
- What? Oh my gosh.

1279
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:21.544
Dad. is there still
gonna be a Bake Off?

1280
00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:24.589
- Sweetie. everything
will be fine.

1281
00:56:24.672 --> 00:56:26.674
They're probably figuring
that out right now.

1282
00:56:27.926 --> 00:56:29.135
- What are we gonna do?

1283
00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.762
- Why aren't we in
the faculty lounge?

1284
00:56:30.845 --> 00:56:33.515
- Because the aura in
here is much better

1285
00:56:33.598 --> 00:56:34.724
than in that hole.

1286
00:56:35.725 --> 00:56:36.810
- Okay.

1287
00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:38.645
- It does smell
really good in here.

1288
00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:40.146
- Thank you. Lester.

1289
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:44.567
That's my calm mind and
confidence boost essential oils.

1290
00:56:44.651 --> 00:56:46.778
You know it's really good
for muscle tension too.

1291
00:56:46.861 --> 00:56:48.404
- You know. I've heard of those

1292
00:56:48.488 --> 00:56:49.531
but I'm not sure I
could find a diffuser

1293
00:56:49.614 --> 00:56:51.074
big enough for the entire gym.

1294
00:56:51.157 --> 00:56:53.576
- I could help you
look for one in stores.

1295
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.036
That store Big Buys
might have something.

1296
00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.497
- Oh. don't be silly. Lester.

1297
00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.290
You can borrow my
essential oils.

1298
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:00.792
That way you can try them out.

1299
00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:02.710
- Okay. thanks. guys.
- Mm-hmm!

1300
00:57:02.794 --> 00:57:04.379
- All right. everyone.

1301
00:57:04.462 --> 00:57:05.713
Let's try and focus here.

1302
00:57:08.341 --> 00:57:10.802
Ms. Henderson. what did the
fireman say the damage was?

1303
00:57:13.638 --> 00:57:16.141
- He said an estimated $20.000.

1304
00:57:16.224 --> 00:57:17.851
- What?
- Oh my Lanta.

1305
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:22.522
- Ms. Silvera. did you
see how much contingency

1306
00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:23.773
we have in our budget?

1307
00:57:23.857 --> 00:57:27.318
- Yes. we ran out of
contingency two months ago.

1308
00:57:27.402 --> 00:57:28.736
- How is that possible?

1309
00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:29.946
- [Ms. Silvera] The bathroom
leak on the third floor

1310
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:32.532
really took a hit to
our budget this year.

1311
00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:35.410
- Well. what about DCBX?

1312
00:57:35.493 --> 00:57:38.204
They're the ones sponsoring
the Bake Off prize money.

1313
00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:39.914
Why not ask them for
help with the kitchen?

1314
00:57:39.998 --> 00:57:43.418
- Well. I'm afraid
even if they did help.

1315
00:57:43.501 --> 00:57:46.671
the kitchen would not be
done before next week.

1316
00:57:46.754 --> 00:57:47.839
- The parents are
gonna have a fit

1317
00:57:47.922 --> 00:57:48.798
if we don't have this Bake Off.

1318
00:57:48.882 --> 00:57:50.300
- Well. I know.

1319
00:57:50.383 --> 00:57:51.593
- I'm not...

1320
00:57:51.676 --> 00:57:52.719
No.

1321
00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:53.678
- What if we have
it in the summer?

1322
00:57:53.761 --> 00:57:55.013
(Ms. Silvera laughs)

1323
00:57:55.096 --> 00:57:56.264
- Oh wait. I got it!

1324
00:57:57.724 --> 00:58:00.310
Why don't we just do a no
bake Bake Off Challenge.

1325
00:58:01.394 --> 00:58:02.145
- [Ms. Melanie] Hmm.

1326
00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:06.691
- Bake. no bake Bake Off.

1327
00:58:06.774 --> 00:58:09.235
- I guess that could work.

1328
00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:10.403
- I mean. it can.

1329
00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:12.447
I make no bake
bakes all the time.

1330
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:13.239
- What?

1331
00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.949
You bake too?

1332
00:58:15.033 --> 00:58:18.453
- Yeah. on my days
off with my nieces.

1333
00:58:18.536 --> 00:58:19.704
- Wow.

1334
00:58:19.787 --> 00:58:22.207
- That's the sweetest
thing I've ever heard.

1335
00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:24.751
- Lester. I think you just saved

1336
00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:26.127
the Bake Off Challenge.

1337
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:31.007
- I think I'm in love
with this new plan.

1338
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:31.758
- Yeah. me too.

1339
00:58:31.841 --> 00:58:33.509
What do we do next?

1340
00:58:34.928 --> 00:58:37.347
- Well. we'll announce it
first thing tomorrow morning.

1341
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:38.640
In the meantime.

1342
00:58:38.723 --> 00:58:41.017
let's figure out what
changes we have to make.

1343
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.603
(bright playful music)

1344
00:58:43.686 --> 00:58:44.395
(Mr. Claymore sighs)

1345
00:58:44.479 --> 00:58:45.188
- All right.

1346
00:58:46.564 --> 00:58:48.358
Oh. you're getting some paper.

1347
00:58:48.441 --> 00:58:50.026
- Oh. Lester. you
didn't come prepared.

1348
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:51.194
There you go.

1349
00:58:51.277 --> 00:58:51.861
- Thank you.

1350
00:58:54.447 --> 00:58:57.575
(students chattering)

1351
00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:02.622
- [Maxine] Hey!

1352
00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:04.082
You got your cast off.

1353
00:59:04.165 --> 00:59:05.250
- Yeah.

1354
00:59:05.333 --> 00:59:06.626
- [Maxine] Where do
you think you're going?

1355
00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:07.835
- To class.

1356
00:59:07.919 --> 00:59:10.046
- Your arm looks so much better.

1357
00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:10.213
- Yeah.

1358
00:59:17.512 --> 00:59:19.681
- Can't wait to play
dodge ball with you again.

1359
00:59:19.764 --> 00:59:21.391
Maybe we'll get your other arm.

1360
00:59:22.308 --> 00:59:24.227
- Hey! Come on. let's go.

1361
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:30.608
- I'm so mad about the fire.

1362
00:59:30.692 --> 00:59:32.819
(school bell rings)

1363
00:59:34.821 --> 00:59:36.239
- All right. everyone.

1364
00:59:36.322 --> 00:59:39.284
Settle down. settle down.

1365
00:59:39.367 --> 00:59:42.370
I have some news this
morning to pass onto you.

1366
00:59:43.705 --> 00:59:45.039
As you all know. we
had a bit of a fire

1367
00:59:45.123 --> 00:59:49.127
in the cafeteria kitchen
a couple of nights ago.

1368
00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:52.755
Luckily. the damage
was contained.

1369
00:59:52.839 --> 00:59:55.508
However. our ovens
for the Bake Off

1370
00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:57.010
are completely destroyed.

1371
00:59:58.219 --> 01:00:00.179
So. who are my
contestants. please?

1372
01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.472
Raise your hands.

1373
01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:04.684
You four will now compete

1374
01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.937
in a No Bake Bake Off Challenge.

1375
01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:12.358
Like last year. the first two
challenges will be a surprise

1376
01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:15.361
and you'll have 15
minutes to complete it.

1377
01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.281
As for the third
and final challenge.

1378
01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:19.741
unlike last year.

1379
01:00:19.824 --> 01:00:23.036
instead of you baking a cake
for the ultimate showdown.

1380
01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.579
you will now be making

1381
01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:29.125
an Ultimate Spring No Bake
Cheesecake. all right?

1382
01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:33.713
Don't forget next Friday we
will have early dismissal.

1383
01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:37.633
Now any students who are not
participating in the Bake Off

1384
01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:39.927
please be sure to be there

1385
01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:42.305
to cheer your peers on.

1386
01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:44.182
Does anybody have any questions?

1387
01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:47.352
Oh. Vanessa.

1388
01:00:47.435 --> 01:00:49.562
- We're still having it
in the cafeteria. right?

1389
01:00:49.645 --> 01:00:50.355
- Yes.

1390
01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:51.731
And in the meantime.

1391
01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:54.484
we'll be having our lunches
here in the classroom.

1392
01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:55.902
Okay.

1393
01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:58.071
All right. now if everyone
will open their book

1394
01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:01.074
to page 133. we'll read the poem

1395
01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:03.993
"A Chance I Have"
by Kate Miller.

1396
01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:14.962
All right. go ahead.

1397
01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:16.839
- [Student] Yes. Ms. Melanie.

1398
01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:18.966
"A Chance I Have"
by Kate Miller.

1399
01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:21.302
Chances come and go.

1400
01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:24.389
Some we take. some we miss.

1401
01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.058
- [Brie] I'm sorry.

1402
01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:28.434
I didn't mean to
make you mad at me.

1403
01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:31.854
- [Millie] No. I'm sorry.

1404
01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:33.272
I was being a ding-dong.

1405
01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:38.194
- [Brie] Well now I really
don't know what to do.

1406
01:01:38.277 --> 01:01:38.945
A No Bake Bake Off?

1407
01:01:43.324 --> 01:01:44.909
- [Millie] I know. right?

1408
01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:47.120
Well. don't tell me.

1409
01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.121
I don't wanna know.

1410
01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.459
- [Student] And the chance
I have each and every day.

1411
01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.503
A chance I often miss

1412
01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:57.880
and a chance I often run from.

1413
01:01:57.964 --> 01:01:59.674
- [Ms. Melanie]
Brie. next verse.

1414
01:02:01.634 --> 01:02:02.677
- And the chance I have

1415
01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.928
is the chance I have

1416
01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:04.971
that makes life worth
taking another breath.

1417
01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.683
- [Ms. Melanie]
Millie. next verse.

1418
01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:14.147
(insects chirping)

1419
01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:21.279
- [Jamie] Get some
rest. sweet pea.

1420
01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:22.738
- You're gonna do
great tomorrow. honey.

1421
01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:23.990
- We got all the ingredients

1422
01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:25.700
for the cheesecake. right. Mom?

1423
01:02:25.783 --> 01:02:27.869
- Yes. I checked five times.

1424
01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:28.870
- [Brie] Okay.

1425
01:02:28.953 --> 01:02:30.830
- How's your arm doing?

1426
01:02:30.913 --> 01:02:31.706
- It's a little stiff

1427
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:33.916
but it's so. so much better.

1428
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.918
- Well no matter what
happens tomorrow.

1429
01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:37.044
we're proud of you.

1430
01:02:37.128 --> 01:02:38.379
- Thanks. Dad. Goodnight.

1431
01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.590
- Goodnight. baby.

1432
01:02:40.673 --> 01:02:41.632
- Goodnight. sweetie.

1433
01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:44.010
- Goodnight. Mamma.

1434
01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.396
(insects chirping)
(dog barking in distance)

1435
01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.320
- Dad! You're home so late.

1436
01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:04.906
- I know.

1437
01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:06.449
Crazy day today.

1438
01:03:06.532 --> 01:03:09.660
- [Vanessa] I still need
to go to the grocery store.

1439
01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:11.162
- We'll go tomorrow.

1440
01:03:11.245 --> 01:03:13.414

01:14:12.739 --> 01:14:15.534
- Um. I'm pretty sure they're
cleaning up right now.

1623
01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:16.618
- Dang it.

1624
01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:17.828
- Sorry.

1625
01:14:17.911 --> 01:14:18.954
- You gotta wait
your turn. mister.

1626
01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:23.125
- Um. I'll be right back.

1627
01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.502
- [Jamie] Okay.

1628
01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:29.047
(soft music)

1629
01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.328
- Vanessa. are you okay?

1630
01:14:59.411 --> 01:14:59.828
- [Vanessa] Go away. Brie.

1631
01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.373
- I'm sorry your dad isn't here.

1632
01:15:06.543 --> 01:15:07.628
I just wanted to tell you

1633
01:15:07.711 --> 01:15:09.379
that if you ever need anything

1634
01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:10.964
you can count on me.

1635
01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:13.467
even if you make my life
miserable sometimes.

1636
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:15.761
- Brie. I don't
wanna talk to you.

1637
01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.512
Now go away!

1638
01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:18.972
- You know what?

1639
01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:20.098
Maybe if you weren't such
a brat all of the time.

1640
01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:23.143
your friends would be in
here trying to help you.

1641
01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.729
Instead. they're out
there talking to Jody.

1642
01:15:25.812 --> 01:15:27.147
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

1643
01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:29.483
- [Brie] I'm just
trying to help.

1644
01:15:29.566 --> 01:15:30.692
- I don't need your help.

1645
01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:32.486
Now go away or I'll-

1646
01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:33.737
- You'll what?

1647
01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.657
Call me names. embarrass
me in front of everyone.

1648
01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:38.367
break my arm?

1649
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:40.869
Oh wait. you've already
done all those things.

1650
01:15:42.162 --> 01:15:43.997
I don't even know why
I try with you anymore.

1651
01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:05.060
- We will now start
the second challenge.

1652
01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:07.938
One of my favorite
desserts growing up.

1653
01:16:08.021 --> 01:16:12.901
this is my Auntie
May's marvelous no
bake banana pudding.

1654
01:16:14.486 --> 01:16:18.407
You will have exactly 15 minutes
to complete this challenge.

1655
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:20.033
Lester. are you ready?

1656
01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:20.826
(playful music)

1657
01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:21.827
- I was born for this.

1658
01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:23.787
- Yeah. you were.

1659
01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:28.792
- Ready. set.

1660
01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:30.085
bake!
(timer beeps)

1661
01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:33.839
(audience applauding)
(bright cheerful music)

1662
01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:52.774
- Oh my gosh.

1663
01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:54.443
There's a lot of
mixing in this one.

1664
01:16:54.526 --> 01:16:55.986
- Focus. Brie. 15 minutes.

1665
01:16:57.321 --> 01:16:58.488
- Come on. Brie. hustle.

1666
01:17:07.497 --> 01:17:08.206
- Let's go. Jody.

1667
01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:09.249
Mix it all together.

1668
01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:10.417
- This is a tough one.

1669
01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:12.169
- I know. I am so nervous.

1670
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:18.008
- [Jamie] How much time is left?

1671
01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:22.137
- Three minutes.
bakers. Three minutes.

1672
01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.021
(Vanessa yawns)

1673
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:14.648
(soft music)

1674
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:28.412
- Oh no.

1675
01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.372
- Brie. Vanessa just left.

1676
01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:33.875
- [Brie] Whatever.

1677
01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.631
- I hope she's okay.

1678
01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:45.804
- And that's five.
four. three. two. one.

1679
01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.305
Time! Hands up. bakers.

1680
01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:50.851
(audience applauding)

1681
01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:53.645
- It's getting hot in here. wow.

1682
01:18:59.359 --> 01:19:00.902
- Bakers. please bring
your banana puddings

1683
01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:01.820
up to the judging table.

1684
01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:04.030
(audience chattering)

1685
01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:15.500
(light music)

1686
01:19:22.215 --> 01:19:24.134
- Yeah. I think that
one looks the best.

1687
01:19:24.217 --> 01:19:26.845
I mean. that one's missing
cookies altogether.

1688
01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:27.971
Oh yeah. that's Vanessa.

1689
01:19:28.054 --> 01:19:30.015
We're still gonna have
to deduct the points.

1690
01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:31.600
- I think she tried.

1691
01:19:31.683 --> 01:19:32.893
- Yeah. but I'm
still gonna have to

1692
01:19:32.976 --> 01:19:35.187
give her zero points
for presentation.

1693
01:19:41.401 --> 01:19:42.027
- Mm-mm.

1694
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.779
- [Samantha] Yes. Jody!

1695
01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:47.991
(audience applauding)

1696
01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:51.828
- Oh my god.

1697
01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:53.497
That is the best
pudding I've ever had.

1698
01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.873
But we can't show them.

1699
01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:58.919
(Mr. Claymore exhales deeply)

1700
01:19:59.002 --> 01:19:59.836
- Why am I not floating up

1701
01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.087
in an angel cloud right now?

1702
01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:01.254
This is amazing.

1703
01:20:04.257 --> 01:20:06.301
(soft tense music)

1704
01:20:06.384 --> 01:20:11.264
This is so good.
- It is so good.

1705
01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:11.431
- Mm.

1706
01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:13.391
Okay.

1707
01:20:19.773 --> 01:20:20.607
- Yep.
- Okay.

1708
01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:21.107
- You guys ready?

1709
01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:29.824
- How's your arm feeling?

1710
01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:31.034
- It hurts a bit.

1711
01:20:32.285 --> 01:20:34.079
I can't believe she
just walked out.

1712
01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:37.082
- Yeah. her dad isn't here.

1713
01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:39.000
- I know.

1714
01:20:43.421 --> 01:20:45.382
- Are you okay?

1715
01:20:45.465 --> 01:20:46.424
- Yeah.

1716
01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:48.510
- Where are your parents?

1717
01:20:48.593 --> 01:20:49.844
- I don't know where my dad is.

1718
01:20:49.928 --> 01:20:50.220
- What about your mom?

1719
01:20:52.931 --> 01:20:54.349
- I don't have one anymore.

1720
01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:58.436
- Oh my gosh. I am so sorry.

1721
01:20:58.520 --> 01:20:59.938
I had no idea.

1722
01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:00.939
- It's fine.

1723
01:21:04.317 --> 01:21:05.026
- Vanessa.

1724
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:06.027
- [Vanessa] Dad!

1725
01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:09.281
- I'm so sorry. Vanessa.

1726
01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:10.699
I tried leaving early

1727
01:21:10.782 --> 01:21:12.284
but my boss wouldn't let me go.

1728
01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:14.327
- You missed like
almost all of it.

1729
01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:14.494
- I know.

1730
01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:16.246
But I'm here now.

1731
01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:20.125
Please don't be mad.

1732
01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.918
- I thought you weren't
gonna come at all.

1733
01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:23.962
You're the worst dad ever.

1734
01:21:24.045 --> 01:21:26.464
(soft music)

1735
01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:28.008
- I can't tell you
how hard it's been

1736
01:21:28.091 --> 01:21:29.342
not having your mom around.

1737
01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:33.555
I can't do everything myself.

1738
01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:35.807
- You're never home

1739
01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.893
and you never care
about anything I do.

1740
01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:38.935
I hate you.

1741
01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:44.065
- Please understand. Vanessa.

1742
01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:46.443
I'm so sorry.

1743
01:21:47.485 --> 01:21:49.154
- I just wanna go home.

1744
01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:50.238
I already messed up
in the second round.

1745
01:21:52.532 --> 01:21:55.160
- Sweetie. if your mother
were here right now.

1746
01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:56.202
she'd be so proud of you.

1747
01:21:57.996 --> 01:21:59.914
- I want to go home.

1748
01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:00.373
- Come on. Vanessa.

1749
01:22:03.209 --> 01:22:04.044
- Come on. Vanessa.

1750
01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:05.837
You still have a chance.

1751
01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.422
- [Vanessa] But I
already messed up.

1752
01:22:07.505 --> 01:22:08.965
- So what?

1753
01:22:09.049 --> 01:22:11.593
This last challenge is
what matters most anyway.

1754
01:22:11.676 --> 01:22:13.303
- All right.
children. It's time.

1755
01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:16.640
Mr. Weiler.

1756
01:22:16.723 --> 01:22:19.017
I haven't seen you in a while.

1757
01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.894
- [Eugene] Yes. apologies.

1758
01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:21.936
- Well. please have a seat.

1759
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.938
We're about to start.

1760
01:22:24.022 --> 01:22:24.731
Come on.

1761
01:22:24.814 --> 01:22:27.442
(pleasant music)

1762
01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:30.737
- [Vanessa] Thanks. Jody.

1763
01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:32.238
- Don't mention it.

1764
01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:46.378
(audience chattering)

1765
01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:50.423
- Bakers. this is your
third and final challenge.

1766
01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:52.008
You have your
ingredients with you

1767
01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.969
that you brought from home.

1768
01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:57.097
You will have 45
minutes to create

1769
01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:00.850
the Ultimate Spring
No Bake Cheesecake.

1770
01:23:01.976 --> 01:23:03.269
Okay. ready?

1771
01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:04.521
Okay.

1772
01:23:04.604 --> 01:23:06.690
Ready. set.

1773
01:23:06.773 --> 01:23:07.565

1774
01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:10.276
(upbeat music)

1775
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:11.361
- Go Vanessa!

1776
01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:14.280
- [Don] You got this. Jody!

1777
01:23:14.364 --> 01:23:17.492
(audience applauding)

1778
01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:27.961
- [Jamie] Go. Brie!

1779
01:23:28.044 --> 01:23:29.754
- [Barb] Go. Millie!

1780
01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:31.214
- You got this. Jody.

1781
01:23:31.297 --> 01:23:32.215
- Yes. Jody!

1782
01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.724
- Push through. Brie.

1783
01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:43.727
- I'm trying.

1784
01:23:46.271 --> 01:23:48.648
- Yeah. she just broke her arm.

1785
01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:50.358
Oh.

1786
01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:52.402
♪ Oh ♪

1787
01:23:58.491 --> 01:24:00.493
- Oh my sweet jellybeans.

1788
01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:09.002
- Oh my gosh.

1789
01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:10.128
This would be so much easier

1790
01:24:10.211 --> 01:24:11.755
with an electric mixer.

1791
01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:14.048
- Brie. if you
need to stop. stop.

1792
01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:14.883
It's okay.

1793
01:24:14.966 --> 01:24:16.134
Don't hurt yourself.

1794
01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:16.968
- I'm fine.

1795
01:24:18.803 --> 01:24:20.388
- How much time is left?

1796
01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:21.723
- Oh. right.

1797
01:24:21.806 --> 01:24:22.807
20 minutes left. bakers.

1798
01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:27.437
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

1799
01:24:30.398 --> 01:24:33.318

my blueberries.

Luckily I have more.

(soft suspenseful music)

1857
01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:34.225
- I mean. come on. it's a cat.

1858
01:28:34.308 --> 01:28:36.978
Who doesn't love a cat cake?

1859
01:28:37.061 --> 01:28:38.354
- That was very cute. right?

1860
01:28:38.438 --> 01:28:39.605
- Was that just whipped cream?

1861
01:28:39.689 --> 01:28:41.274
- [Ms. Silvera] That
was a little lazy.

1862
01:28:41.357 --> 01:28:42.442
I think I'm good.

1863
01:28:45.069 --> 01:28:45.945
- All right.

1864
01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:48.489
Oh my god.

1865
01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:49.741
- Is it Oreo?

1866
01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:52.493
Oreo is my favorite.
- Seriously good.

1867
01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:53.286
Eat that.

1868
01:28:53.369 --> 01:28:54.704
- I'm going to.

1869
01:28:54.787 --> 01:28:56.372
- Oh my god.
- They put caramel

1870
01:28:56.456 --> 01:28:56.789
on this one too.

1871
01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:00.501
- She did this. didn't she?

1872
01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:05.423
- Like OMG. right?
- That is the best

1873
01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:07.425
dang cheesecake I've ever had.

1874
01:29:07.508 --> 01:29:08.718
- [Ms. Henderson]
Pass me the cake.

1875
01:29:08.801 --> 01:29:09.677
I mean the cat.

1876
01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:11.929
Pass me the cat.
- Mm-mm-mm.

1877
01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:12.638
Hold on. I need another
bite of this one.

1878
01:29:23.608 --> 01:29:25.109
- It's not half bad.

1879
01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:27.612
It's kinda good.

1880
01:29:27.695 --> 01:29:29.405
- Does it look better
than it tastes though?

1881
01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:31.949
- Probably. yeah.

1882
01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:35.411
- You gotta be careful for that.

1883
01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:37.497
- Is this the one
she screwed up?

1884
01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:38.414
- I don't know.

1885
01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:39.707
It just looks like a cat.

1886
01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:41.709
- Hey. at least there's
some cheesecake.

1887
01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:44.587
- [Ms. Silvera]
There's no sugar.

1888
01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:45.963
- I actually like that.

1889
01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:47.256
It's not as rich.

1890
01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.549
- [Ms. Henderson] Exactly.

1891
01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:49.634
- [Ms. Silvera] This is
like a diabetic cake.

1892
01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:50.635
Like this is what
my grandma eats.

1893
01:29:58.184 --> 01:29:59.435
- This one's very fruity.

1894
01:29:59.519 --> 01:30:01.312
It's good. it's good.

1895
01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:04.774
- This is Vanessa's.

1896
01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.152
- I think I'm good guys.

1897
01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.445
I've got mine up.

1898
01:30:09.529 --> 01:30:10.196
- I just need to try
this one more time

1899
01:30:10.279 --> 01:30:11.114
because it's plain.

1900
01:30:11.197 --> 01:30:12.490
I need to cleanse my palette.

1901
01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:13.491
- You go ahead.

1902
01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:20.039

1903
01:30:21.707 --> 01:30:23.709

1904
01:30:23.793 --> 01:30:25.086

Brie Hayes!

1913
01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:09.005

- Are you serious?

1917
01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.226
- She doesn't even believe it.

1918
01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:26.522
- [Jamie] Go Brie!

1919
01:31:33.237 --> 01:31:34.071

1921
01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:41.621
I knew it!

1922
01:31:41.704 --> 01:31:42.705
I told you. I told you!

1923
01:31:42.788 --> 01:31:43.456
(Jamie laughs)

1924
01:31:43.539 --> 01:31:45.791
Let's go. let's go.

1925
01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:45.958
Hey!

1926
01:31:49.754 --> 01:31:50.796
- I am so proud of you.

1927
01:31:52.423 --> 01:31:53.633
- That's our girl.

1928
01:31:53.716 --> 01:31:54.717
- I'm pretty sure you can go get

1929
01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.052
some chocolate cheesecake now.

1930
01:31:56.135 --> 01:31:56.761
- Yes!

1931
01:31:58.262 --> 01:31:59.138
- How's your arm feeling?

1932
01:31:59.222 --> 01:32:00.431
- It's good.
- That's good.

1933
01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:01.474
It doesn't hurt very much.
- Yeah?

1934
01:32:01.557 --> 01:32:02.266
I am so proud of you.

1935
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.184
I knew you could do it.

1936
01:32:03.267 --> 01:32:04.685
It was all those trials. Brie.

1937
01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:05.603
I told you they were gonna work.

1938
01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:07.438
- You did so good.

1939
01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:10.566
You did so good.
I'm so proud of you.

1940
01:32:12.151 --> 01:32:15.071
- My heart was beating
way above average.

1941
01:32:15.154 --> 01:32:15.947
(Mr. Claymore chuckles)

1942
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.281
What a great Bake Off.

1943
01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:18.074
- It was. it was.

1944
01:32:19.909 --> 01:32:21.285
But how did I do?

1945
01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.955
- Oh. you did a
fantastic job announcing.

1946
01:32:24.038 --> 01:32:24.872
- Why. thank you.

1947
01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:26.249
You did a great job judging.

1948
01:32:26.332 --> 01:32:27.583
- Oh. thank you.

1949
01:32:27.667 --> 01:32:28.376
- Oh. honey!

1950
01:32:28.459 --> 01:32:30.127
I'm so proud of you.

1951
01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:31.379
- Thank you. love.

1952
01:32:31.462 --> 01:32:33.589
- Andrew. this is
my wife. Sophia.

1953
01:32:33.673 --> 01:32:34.590
- Hi.

1954
01:32:34.674 --> 01:32:35.841
- [Mr. Claymore]
Of course it is.

1955
01:32:35.925 --> 01:32:37.802
- Oh. wait. Andrew.

1956
01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:40.137
You gave Lester the
essential oils. right?

1957
01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:42.765
I absolutely love them.

1958
01:32:42.848 --> 01:32:44.558
- Yes. yes I did.

1959
01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:46.769
Great meeting you.

1960
01:32:47.645 --> 01:32:49.146
- Yeah. you too.
- Excuse me.

1961
01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.898
(playful music)

1962
01:32:53.859 --> 01:32:53.901
- It's okay.

1963
01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.655
You're a strong independent man.

1964
01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:58.781
(Mr. Claymore sighs)

1965
01:32:58.864 --> 01:33:00.324
- Yes.

1966
01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:02.660
Now I just need something
to fill my heart.

1967
01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:03.828
- Cheesecake.

1968
01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:06.831
(both laughing)

1969
01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:09.208
And a glass of wine.
- Excuse me. guys.

1970
01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:10.668
- Hey. Sophia.

1971
01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:11.544

- Oh. nice to see you too.

1973

1974
01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:15.006
- It's good. How's the business?

1975
01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:17.133
- [Sophia] Oh. it's
fantastic. It's great.

1976
01:33:17.216 --> 01:33:18.384
- [Ms. Henderson] Good. you
did such a good job today.

1977
01:33:18.467 --> 01:33:19.802
- [Lester] I forgot you
two know each other.

1978
01:33:19.885 --> 01:33:20.845
Thank you.

1979
01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.263
- [Barb] You did
great. Millie bear.

1980
01:33:22.346 --> 01:33:23.139
- Thanks. Mom.

1981
01:33:23.222 --> 01:33:24.724
- [Barb] I'm so proud of you.

1982
01:33:24.807 --> 01:33:25.641
How should we celebrate?

1983
01:33:25.725 --> 01:33:28.477
- Hmm. Cheesecake.

1984
01:33:28.561 --> 01:33:29.061
- Okay! Let's do it.

1985
01:33:31.856 --> 01:33:35.401
- Son. we practiced
this 100 times.

1986
01:33:35.484 --> 01:33:37.486
You must've measured the
vanilla extract wrong.

1987
01:33:37.570 --> 01:33:38.529
- [Jody] Sorry. Dad.

1988
01:33:38.612 --> 01:33:39.655
- Hon. don't be so hard on him.

1989
01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:40.865
He did great.

1990
01:33:40.948 --> 01:33:42.450
You did great. Jody.

1991
01:33:42.533 --> 01:33:43.576
- [Jody] Thanks. Mom.

1992
01:33:43.659 --> 01:33:45.036
- [Samantha] You did great.

1993
01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:48.706
- Mom would've been
so proud of you.

1994
01:33:48.789 --> 01:33:50.833
Your cheesecake looks amazing.

1995
01:33:50.916 --> 01:33:52.418
- Thanks. Dad.

1996
01:33:52.501 --> 01:33:55.087
(all chattering)

1997
01:34:01.844 --> 01:34:03.054
(soft music)

1998
01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:06.640
- Mm. smells like chocolate.
- Thank you.

1999
01:34:06.724 --> 01:34:08.809
- [Student In Hat] Whoever
made this did a real good job.

2000
01:34:08.893 --> 01:34:09.727
- Which one?

2001
01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.103
- [Student In Hat] That one.

2002
01:34:20.946 --> 01:34:22.073
- [Vanessa] Can I sit with you?

2003
01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:24.992
- No. but you
probably will anyway.

2004
01:34:28.871 --> 01:34:31.791
- I'm sorry for everything
I did to you. Brie.

2005
01:34:31.874 --> 01:34:33.793
- You think a sorry
will unbreak my arm?

2006
01:34:33.876 --> 01:34:34.877
- No.

2007
01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.212
I never meant that to happen.

2008
01:34:36.295 --> 01:34:38.089
- You never even said
sorry when it did happen.

2009
01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:41.300
- [Vanessa] Because I didn't
think you wanted to talk to me.

2010
01:34:41.384 --> 01:34:44.136
- Well. I just
wanted to tell you

2011
01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:45.805
that I never meant
to not be there

2012
01:34:45.888 --> 01:34:46.806
when your mom died.

2013
01:34:46.889 --> 01:34:48.641
- Yeah. I know.

2014
01:34:48.724 --> 01:34:49.850
- Do you really?

2015
01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:50.643
- [Vanessa] Yeah.

2016
01:34:51.936 --> 01:34:53.771
I was just mean to you
when we were younger

2017
01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:55.606
so you wouldn't
come over anymore.

2018
01:34:55.689 --> 01:34:56.399
- Why?

2019
01:34:58.150 --> 01:35:01.404
- Because my mom
loved having you over

2020
01:35:01.487 --> 01:35:03.739
and you got all the attention
when you were there.

2021
01:35:03.823 --> 01:35:05.408
So I started being mean to you

2022
01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:07.910
so that we wouldn't be friends

2023
01:35:07.993 --> 01:35:10.121
and then. well. you know.

2024
01:35:10.204 --> 01:35:14.959
- Well. I'm sorry
for everything too.

2025
01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:15.084
- [Vanessa] I know.

2026
01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:21.424
- Vanessa. can I talk
to you for a sec?

2027
01:35:21.507 --> 01:35:22.550
- Uh. yeah.

2028
01:35:24.969 --> 01:35:26.429
Sorry I lied to
you about my dad.

2029
01:35:26.512 --> 01:35:28.347
He's not really a doctor.

2030
01:35:28.431 --> 01:35:29.598
- Oh. no.

2031
01:35:29.682 --> 01:35:30.516
I wanted to see
if you would like

2032
01:35:30.599 --> 01:35:31.809
to eat dinner with me tonight.

2033
01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:32.852
- Really?

2034
01:35:32.935 --> 01:35:35.813
- Yeah. I mean. my
parents would be there

2035
01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.314
but they can sit
at another table.

2036
01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:38.691
- That's awesome.

2037
01:35:38.774 --> 01:35:40.568
Do you think my
dad could come too?

2038
01:35:40.651 --> 01:35:42.153
He needs more
company these days.

2039
01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:44.196
- [Jody] Yeah. of course.

2040
01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.948
- You wanna go inside now. Brie?

2041
01:35:46.949 --> 01:35:47.867
- I'll wait for my dad.

2042
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:48.993
You guys go ahead.

2043
01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:50.578
- [Vanessa] Okay.
see you in there.

2044
01:35:53.664 --> 01:35:55.332
- Don't tell me any
bad news. Grant.

2045
01:35:57.626 --> 01:35:58.335
Mm-hmm.

2046
01:36:00.546 --> 01:36:01.255
Yeah.

2047
01:36:03.215 --> 01:36:03.257
You didn't?

2048
01:36:05.718 --> 01:36:06.427
Yes!

2049
01:36:07.344 --> 01:36:08.095
Thank you! Finally!

2050
01:36:10.848 --> 01:36:11.515
All right.

2051
01:36:12.808 --> 01:36:14.268
Okay. I'll call you tomorrow.

2052
01:36:14.351 --> 01:36:16.353
Bye. (laughs)

2053
01:36:18.481 --> 01:36:19.523
Looks like you're
not the only one

2054
01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:20.858
getting a big fat check.

2055
01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:22.568
They tripled my advance.

2056
01:36:22.651 --> 01:36:24.195
more stores want my book.

2057
01:36:24.278 --> 01:36:25.070
