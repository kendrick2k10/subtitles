see who she hired.

364
00:27:13.257 --> 00:27:14.507
They’ll know you were there.

365
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:20.143
Okay. then I need to figure out
who’s trying to set me up

366
00:27:20.222 --> 00:27:22.222
before the police do.

367
00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:26.899
I mean. whoever did this.

368
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.400
they could have killed me.

369
00:27:29.523 --> 00:27:31.613
They could have
made me disappear.

370
00:27:31.692 --> 00:27:34.442
No. they wanted to
see me behind bars.

371
00:27:34.528 --> 00:27:37.658
Or. whoever did this

372
00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:39.909
wanted Lydia Mosley dead.

373
00:27:40.033 --> 00:27:41.583
and you were simply
caught in the crossfire.

374
00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:43.372
I don’t believe that.

375
00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:45.083
I need to figure this out.

376
00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.000
Thank you. I’ll be in touch.

377
00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:51.460

Uh. more like again.

392
00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:52.692
I brought you your phone back.
and also something just to say

393

thank you for what you did.

Yeah. well.
now that you mention it.

399

I have been rethinking
my spare key policy.

400

Do you want to come in?

Yeah. that’d be good. Thanks.

Yeah. sorry about the mess.

Oh. it’s okay.

404
00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:18.921
Um...

405
00:29:24.846 --> 00:29:27.306
(wiping hands)

406
00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:31.812
So. um. what do you
do for a living. Billy?

407
00:29:31.895 --> 00:29:33.975
You said construction. right?

408
00:29:34.064 --> 00:29:36.574
Yeah. you know. um...

409
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.820
Odd jobs.

410

This and that.

Look. I did want to
thank you for yesterday.

414
00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:56.004
It’s been a long time since
someone’s been nice to me.

415
00:29:57.921 --> 00:29:59.511
But you’re right.

416
00:29:59.589 --> 00:30:01.049
I am here because
I need your help.

417
00:30:01.174 --> 00:30:03.134
Okay.

418
00:30:03.218 --> 00:30:05.088
I think that
somebody is following me.

419
00:30:06.888 --> 00:30:08.138
You can’t go to the cops?

420
00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:12.315
This related to the accident
that happened yesterday.

421
00:30:14.688 --> 00:30:15.978
Right.

422
00:30:18.358 --> 00:30:20.528
(sighing)

423
00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.952
I was in prison.

424
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.660
For almost three years.
I just got out not long ago.

425
00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:29.035
My parole had
two conditions. okay?

426
00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:30.871
Get a job
and stay out of trouble.

427
00:30:30.954 --> 00:30:34.044
and yesterday
I messed up both of them.

428
00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:36.786
So you came here.

429
00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:38.377
I managed to get a picture

430
00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:40.343
of the license plate
of the car who I think

431
00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:42.342
has been following me.
and I thought that maybe

432
00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:45.394
you might know a guy
that could help me run it.

433
00:30:45.469 --> 00:30:47.889
So. you’re saying I kind of
look like a guy who knows a guy?

434
00:30:51.433 --> 00:30:53.063
Your tattoo.

435
00:30:53.143 --> 00:30:55.403
I saw something similar
when I was on the inside.

436
00:30:59.358 --> 00:31:00.568
Alright.

437
00:31:04.613 --> 00:31:08.203
Well. you’re not wrong.

438
00:31:13.622 --> 00:31:14.752
In my line of work...

439
00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:17.543
(cans clattering)

440
00:31:17.626 --> 00:31:19.916
...you need to look up
a few IDs. so to speak.

441
00:31:20.003 --> 00:31:21.713
Know who you’re
really dealing with.

442
00:31:21.797 --> 00:31:24.837
Now. I downloaded this software
from a very charming fellow

443
00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:28.475
on a message board that
shall remain nameless.

444
00:31:28.595 --> 00:31:29.845
(typing)

445
00:31:34.142 --> 00:31:35.352
What about me?

446
00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:37.515
Did you look me up?

447
00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.534
Maybe.

448
00:31:42.609 --> 00:31:43.859
And what did you find?

449
00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:51.529
I found a sad story about a car
crash from a few years back.

450
00:31:52.828 --> 00:31:55.078
The rest is none of my business.

451
00:31:58.333 --> 00:31:59.633
So. you don’t care?

452
00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:02.461
No. I care.

453
00:32:04.214 --> 00:32:05.724
Believe me. I care.

454
00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:08.469
My. um...

455
00:32:08.552 --> 00:32:09.802
My mom. she...

456
00:32:14.724 --> 00:32:16.564
Let’s just say that I know

457
00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:19.903
something about being
a single mom with a record

458
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.270
and raising a son.

459
00:32:22.441 --> 00:32:23.651
Or two.

460
00:32:27.404 --> 00:32:29.164
I just really appreciate
what you’re going through.

461
00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:31.621
And I want to help you.

462
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.580
I really do. okay?

463
00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:38.999
Let me see that picture again.

464
00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:46.171
Huh. Gun-metal grey Audi.

465
00:32:49.426 --> 00:32:51.006
Let me try something.

466
00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:52.716
(typing)

467
00:32:52.846 --> 00:32:55.766
Yeah.

468
00:32:55.849 --> 00:32:57.429
Here we go.

469
00:32:57.517 --> 00:32:59.187
Maynard Barnes.

470
00:32:59.269 --> 00:33:03.649
AKA Jack Manson.
AKA Peter Budd.

471
00:33:03.732 --> 00:33:05.362
He’s a career criminal.

472
00:33:05.484 --> 00:33:08.114
I mean. why would someone
like him want to follow me?

473
00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:09.365
(groaning)

474
00:33:09.446 --> 00:33:10.566
You tell me.

475
00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:12.617
No. I kept my nose
clean in prison.

476
00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:14.529
and I’ve kept myself ever since.

477
00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:20.289
This guy. he drives around in a
car with his own license plate.

478
00:33:20.373 --> 00:33:23.173
Okay. so maybe he just
thought you were an easy mark.

479
00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:25.961
He thought he wouldn’t
have to worry about you.

480
00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:27.506
Still. I don’t think he’s
the sharpest tool in the shed.

481
00:33:27.589 --> 00:33:30.379
you know?
Somebody has to be paying him.

482
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:32.509
He’s probably not the one
pulling the strings.

483
00:33:35.555 --> 00:33:36.715
I’m going to find out who.

484
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.638
Let’s go.

485
00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:40.225
No. you don’t have to come.

486
00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:42.062
Honestly.
you’ve done enough. Billy.

487
00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:44.805
No. no. I’m not arguing this.
I’m not arguing this. okay?

488
00:33:46.483 --> 00:33:49.403
That being said though.
this guy Maynard

489
00:33:49.486 --> 00:33:51.196
is pretty far out there.

490
00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:54.699
So. I’d appreciate if you could
fill up my tank with gas.

491
00:33:54.783 --> 00:33:56.413
and. uh. then I’ll
take you out there.

492
00:33:58.912 --> 00:34:01.212

the lay of the land.

505

I mean. he could be alone.

team in there for all we know.

What happened?

512

We were...

he’d had a bit
too much to drink.

He was being playful

517
00:35:42.724 --> 00:35:44.104
and he was trying to kiss me.

518
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.520

three and a half years
