00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:03.791
If we can all bring out our smart phones and
make sure that the app is loaded.

4
00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:09.625
Yes. You will see different design options and then...

5
00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:13.500
You need to now just click on 'immerse'
where you see 'immerse'.

6
00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:19.291
I can see a pink kiddies room with a double bunk.

7
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.791
Ok. Now can anybody else click on any
other design option of your choice?

8
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.375
-I see a hotel lobby. complete with virtual people.
-Hmmm.

9
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.000
Lolade...

10
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.250
-M.D. will love this.
-Ok...

11
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:42.000
Help me wear it.

12
00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:46.416
-Let me adjust it.
-Ok. Thank you.

13
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.500
Super impressive. Wow!

14
00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:54.166
So how is a software doing this?

15
00:03:54.291 --> 00:03:57.750
-Oh. uhm... its real time retracing actually.
Ok.

16
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.625
Yes.

17
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.625
Ehm. what Abel is trying to explain is that uhm...

18
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.791
Our app has the latest technology that helps you...

19
00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:11.125
...show fully designed spaces even before you
start building.

20
00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:13.250
So now. they can correct on the go...

21
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.625
...and now with that app. they get to experience
the spaces for everything that it is.

22
00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:22.666
How come mine is not working? I am trying to connect.

23
00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:26.916
Let me guess... that is an android.

24
00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:31.875
Well... uhm... the app has been deployed for iphones...

25
00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:37.916
...and I am guessing that the quality of your clientele use
the best of phones.

26
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Ehm...

27
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:47.250
I am so sorry. I might be able to work on something that can
make it work across all mobile phones.

28
00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:50.625
-I can actually...
-No. we can not.

29
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:57.000
There is absolutely no need to waste time on that.

30
00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:59.125
Like I said...

31
00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:02.041
I always deliver.

32
00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:04.500
That would be all.

33
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:08.666
Abel. you are a brilliant young man. No doubt.

34
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.750
You know. what surprises me is...

35
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.250
The fact that you

36
00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:19.625
...have not realised that the only idea...

37
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.750
...that flies in this company is mine.

38
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:25.250
Yes ma. but this particular product. I can...

39
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.375
Do you know how much it would cost...

40
00:05:27.416 --> 00:05:28.875
...on multiple platforms?

41
00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:31.916
The risks involved if it fails?

42
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:37.375
This company simply exists today because I played safe.

43
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.875
You made me look like an incompetent fool today

44
00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:43.500
I am sorry ma. I am sorry.

45
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.916
Let this be the last time...

46
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:49.041
...you tweak my product without telling me.

47
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:52.416
Ok ma.

48
00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:15.791
Bro. you're still working on this?

49
00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:23.166
Guys... I want to arrange some hot babes.
There will be so much fun tonight.

50
00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:31.666
Why are you frowning? Tell us what's wrong.

51
00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:34.250
-Guy. I'm tired.
-Of what?

52
00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:37.375
I'm tired of Mrs. Yemi constantly stealing my ideas and
claiming them as hers...

53
00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:42.041
-It's not fair now.
-You shouldn't be surprised. Why are you stressing yourself?

54
00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:45.166
Well. there is somethig we can do about it.

55
00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:49.250
These babes I have coming over tonight can help you with...

56
00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:53.916
-...your milky situation. You know...
-Listen. I'm busy tonight.

57
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.000
No mehn.

58
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.500
How can someone so smart be so dumb?

59
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.666
Don't jerk off all your unborn children to all
those models on Fans Alone.

60
00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:08.666
-You are shouting.
-It's true now.

61
00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:15.375
Let me introduce you to some nice girls...
Girls that will give you great sex.

62
00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:17.250
-As your best friend...
-You are not my best friend.

63
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.625
As your best friend. I don't want you to die a virgin.
It won't be good.

64
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.500
Bro. you are a fine boy and it won't be good if you die a
virgin.

65
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.875
No! It's not good.

66
00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:28.875
Tonight will be... tell him. tell him.

67
00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:31.875
Give me my headphones.

68
00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:55.791
Hi Emmanuel.

69
00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.875
So. why are we not at the dining with the rest of the kids?

70
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:03.125
Hmmm? Are you not in a good mood?

71
00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:06.166
I have a special surprise...

72
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:12.625
...and I think it might just put you in a good mood. Yes?

73
00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:17.166
Yaaaay! Awww... I knew you'd like it!

74
00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:20.375
See. it has

75
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.416
Try to press it.

76
00:08:21.416 --> 00:08:23.291
-Aunty welcome!
-Yes!

77
00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:25.250
Hi!

78
00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:28.250
So. are we ready for a dance?

79
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.875
Yes!!!

80
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:32.665
Ok! Let's just spread out. Spread out.

81
00:08:32.665 --> 00:08:38.415
Yes. Common. so we just start on 3 2 1... Let's go!

82
00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:40.415
1...

83
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.625
2...

84
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.625
Common! 3...

85
00:08:44.665 --> 00:08:46.625
4...

86
00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:48.125
5...

87
00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:53.625
Turn round. 6 7 8 9 10.

88
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.625
Then. we go down and up

89
00:08:57.625 --> 00:08:58.625
Down again!

90
00:08:58.625 --> 00:09:01.625
Down and up.

91
00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.500
Well done!

92
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:10.375
So. can anybody guess what we are going to do next?

93
00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:14.041
-Finger painting!
-Yes!! Finger painting!

94
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:20.000
Let's go! Let's go!

95
00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:24.125
Subtitle

96
00:09:31.416 --> 00:09:34.665
This is the third time this week that man is coming here.

97
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.000
That man did not come to play.

98
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
In fact. he said he said he will be coming witha bulldozer
the next time he comes.

99
00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:44.875
Subtitle

100
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.500
So. what are we going to do?

101
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.000
I don't know. Mama can't afford to loose
this place. It will break her.

102
00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:59.250
The real question is. how do we get her another place
and move the children? The time is too short.

103
00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:07.041
We need a miracle to turn things around.

104
00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:11.416
-To keep this place or else...
-We will be shut down?

105
00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:19.750
I don't blame them. The whole area is getting commercialized
and uhm...

106
00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:25.625
If they sell this building. it's worth a lot of money.

107
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:30.541
They kept increasing the rent so that
they wouldn't come across as evil people...

108
00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:35.040
...who forced an orphanage to shut down...

109
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.790
So. the rent is the problem?

110
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.790
Well. yes and no.

111
00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:46.915
They prefer I buy the building for a hundred and fifty
million naira.

112
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.875
You and I know that it's never going to happen.

113
00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:54.665
So. they increased the rent.

114
00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:02.375
They increased the rent from 3.5 million naira to 6 million
naira.

115
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:06.625
How long do we have?

116
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.250
You know. Bianca...

117
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.000
I really worked hard to build this place.

118
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.500
I didn't need to and i really don't know
why I'm still doing this.

119
00:11:20.291 --> 00:11:23.291
How long do we have mama?

120
00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:28.166
12 days Bianca.

121
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.250
We can start a special fund raiser.

122
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.625
-A.. a special fund raiser?
-On social media.

123
00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:42.375
Ok... but what's that going to fetch us?

124
00:11:42.375 --> 00:11:45.375
You'll be surprised.

125
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.415
-Ok... but then i really...
-You don't have to worry about anything.

126
00:11:50.415 --> 00:11:54.000
Zainab and I would sort everything out.
Hmmm?

127
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.915
Ok. If you feel you can pull this off. then we have a deal.

128
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Great!

129
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.291
-Thank you my dear.
-Yes ma.

130
00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:22.875
Do you like my new car?

131
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.500
Go premium and make more money.

132
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.041
Go Premium!!!

133
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.500
Ok. Let's do this.

134
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.541
I want to see your breast.

135
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.250
My... my breast..

136
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.250
Why did you upgrade if you're not going to show your
breasts?

137
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.250
What's this?

138
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.875
What?!

139
00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:41.625
Ok.

140
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.665
Uhmm... Ok.

141
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:53.625
I need you to blow my mind.

142
00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.625
Hmmm... I'm ready for you.

143
00:13:57.415 --> 00:14:00.416
I want to watch you fuck yourself till you cum.

144
00:14:00.791 --> 00:14:01.541
Uh...

145
00:14:02.916 --> 00:14:05.500
Uhm... How about...

146
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.750
...we start slowly...

147
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
...I dance for you...

148
00:14:12.416 --> 00:14:17.041
Fucking fuck yourself till you cum. This is premium. I paid
for this shit.

149
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.500
I understand but...

150
00:14:25.791 --> 00:14:28.791
What?!

151
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.000
Ok...

152
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.915
Hey you.

153
00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:50.625
-Hi
-You're on premium now. You know you can talk to me.

154
00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:53.000
I'd rather chat.

155
00:14:55.415 --> 00:14:59.250
Hmmm... ok... if you say so. Are you stressed?

156
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.250
...because. I'm ready to ease your stress.

157
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.750
How about I...

158
00:15:13.666 --> 00:15:16.666
...kiss you all over

159
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.875
I want to hear you moan

160
00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:25.500
Take off your shorts.

161
00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:37.125
Yeah!

162
00:15:41.165 --> 00:15:44.165
Your body is so soft.

163
00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:46.875
Ah! Shit!

164
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.500
Uuuhhh!

165
00:15:54.625 --> 00:15:57.165
I want to lick you.

166
00:15:57.875 --> 00:15:59.750
Ahh! Shit!

167
00:16:01.791 --> 00:16:04.250
She's all yours.

168
00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:10.375
I love it when you touch me.

169
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:14.416
I want you big man.

170
00:16:14.416 --> 00:16:17.416
I want you inside me.

171
00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:22.541
Eat me up! Eat me up!

172
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.625
Eat me up!

173
00:16:32.125 --> 00:16:35.125
Shit! Shit!

174
00:16:36.665 --> 00:16:38.750
Aaarrghh! Shit!

175
00:17:34.125 --> 00:17:37.125
I'm so sorry to disturb you. I...

176
00:17:38.041 --> 00:17:41.625
I'm so sorry to disturb you. I noticed you are the only one

My sincere apologies. What happened is that a friend of
mine had an emergency and I...

287
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.750
I should have informed the team.

288
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:38.125
You abandoned this entire company because of a friend?

00:29:38.166 --> 00:29:41.166

Bro. I'm sorry.

293
00:29:54.791 --> 00:29:58.375
It didn't make sense. Mrs. Yemi didn't seem like she was
joking.

294
00:29:58.916 --> 00:30:01.916
Leave us out of this your puppy love please.

295
00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:05.625
Wait... who is this your friend I don't know about?

This is real puppy love.

299
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.625
Give me my phone.

300
00:30:24.625 --> 00:30:28.875
Oh ok. So this is the friend that has been keeping you busy
right?

301
00:30:29.541 --> 00:30:32.541
Is she the same person that came to charge?

302
00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:38.875
I hope you're going to tell her you can't make it though.

303
00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.750
-Why?
-...because we have to work on the demo before the end of
today.

304
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.125
Have you forgotten so soon?

305
00:30:53.375 --> 00:30:55.750
Guys... I have something to tell you.

306
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.791
What?

307
00:30:59.166 --> 00:31:05.250
Ok.. So. you know how i have been pitching this idea to Mrs.
Yemi for the longest time... for almost a year and she
keeps on rejecting me everytime.

308
00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:06.125
-Yeah.
-Right?

309
00:31:06.125 --> 00:31:08.125
-Uhum.
-Right?

310
00:31:08.125 --> 00:31:11.125
Come and see.

311
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.500
You see this part here?

312
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Z Capitals?

313
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.875
If she finds out...

314
00:31:28.875 --> 00:31:32.625
-You are dead.
-That is why we will leave before she finds out.

315
00:31:33.625 --> 00:31:36.625
Please. who are the "we"?

316
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.250
Wait... What is the idea?

317
00:31:41.875 --> 00:31:48.500
You know when you play a video game and you can buy coins to
level up or to power up.... Right?

318
00:31:48.625 --> 00:31:57.625
Now. imagine if as a user. you can gift your favorite
celebrity or skit maker or influencer while they are
streaming live.

319
00:31:57.625 --> 00:31:59.000
...like the site where you watch prostitutes right?

320
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.666
Guy. behave yourself. I am being serious.

321
00:32:01.666 --> 00:32:05.875
Listen. celebrities can also gift their fans through the use
of tokens.

322
00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:10.916
The fans can then take those tokens. gather them up and
convert it to cash.

323
00:32:10.916 --> 00:32:14.125
See. listen. there's a lot of moey to be made from this
thing guys

324
00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:17.000
At the end of the day. we don't have to really do much.

325
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.875
The user. the content creator will do the marketing for us.

326
00:32:22.166 --> 00:32:27.250
You know. for a minute there. I thought you were going to
tell us that you finally had sex.

327
00:32:27.875 --> 00:32:33.750
Listen guys. we would have equal stake in the compay and we
will share all the bills as well... equally.

328
00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:39.375
Lanre here would be our head of finance while you will be
our head of marketing.

329
00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:44.375
-...and I will focus on what I know how to do best.
-As one who builds apps as a hobby right?

330
00:32:44.375 --> 00:32:48.541
Aargh man! Common. you know Lanre is the best when it comes
to numbers and finances.

331
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:51.750

Of course I'm in!

334
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.000
Guys! Who wants to stay in this shithole that Mrs. Yemi has
created?

335
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.375
Common... Let's do this!

336
00:33:08.375 --> 00:33:11.750

Something that would really get her attention. Do you
understand?

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:37.125
I mean. the property isn't mine. I was sent to do a job and
that's what I'm doing here now.

443
00:46:37.875 --> 00:46:40.875

Strip for me. Isn't that why I'm paying you?

469
00:51:55.125 --> 00:51:58.500
Uhmm... I thought we were getting to know each other?

470
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Look. I'm a paying customer and you will do whatever I want.

471
00:52:03.625 --> 00:52:06.625
What I want is for you to fucking strip bitch!

472
00:52:13.416 --> 00:52:16.416
Please. don't rate me down.

473
00:53:27.125 --> 00:53:29.416
Why the orphanage?

474
00:53:29.791 --> 00:53:32.791
I mean. you make really good cakes.

475
00:53:33.541 --> 00:53:37.125
You give them out for free. I'm not saying that's a bad
thing but...

476
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
I just want to know why.

477
00:53:43.875 --> 00:53:46.375
It's personal.

478
00:53:46.375 --> 00:53:51.625
...but there's this sort of fulfilment that comes from
taking care of kids.

479
00:53:54.791 --> 00:53:57.791
I guess I'll never understand.

480
00:53:59.166 --> 00:54:02.500
...but. I admire your courage.

481
00:54:12.125 --> 00:54:13.375
But...

482
00:54:13.916 --> 00:54:16.916
It's sad to know that we will have to shut down soon.

483
00:54:19.125 --> 00:54:22.125
Shut down?

484
00:54:22.541 --> 00:54:24.291
Why?

485
00:54:26.125 --> 00:54:29.125
Well. they doubled the rent.

486
00:54:30.125 --> 00:54:36.250
And... Mama is just a retired widow who just wants to take
care of the kids.

487
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:40.250
She can't afford it.

488
00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:45.625

506
00:56:55.125 --> 00:56:57.750

This project is your idea. This business is your idea.

523
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:07.250
If you were really interested in this meeting. you would
have reached out since our houses are basically 15mins from
yours.

524
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:10.250
-Listen...
-Did he say I should listen?

525
00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:17.375
Guys. listen. I promise you that I will make payment before
the end of today.

526
00:59:17.375 --> 00:59:18.500
Same thing you said last week.

527
00:59:18.541 --> 00:59:21.000
Hey. don't talk like that.

528
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Wow! Hi.

529
00:59:24.166 --> 00:59:26.166
Hi. Uhm... Abel. I need to...

530
00:59:26.166 --> 00:59:30.750
Uhm... My name is Chibueze but my friends call me Chiboy.

531
00:59:30.875 --> 00:59:35.041
You can call me Chiboy.
-Hi. Nice to meet you. Bianca.

532
00:59:35.125 --> 00:59:38.125
Yeah. You may kiss your bride.

533
00:59:40.375 --> 00:59:40.750
Ok.

534
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:49.125
Uhm... I'll be back soon. I just want to go somewhere real
quick. I'll soon be back.

535
00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:53.666
-Bye!
-Bye! See you!

536
00:59:53.666 --> 00:59:56.666
Guy... This your girl is so beautiful. Does she have a
sister?

537
00:59:56.916 --> 00:59:58.625
You know like. double date won't be bad right?

538
00:59:58.625 --> 01:00:01.625
-Best friends. sisters ...
-Iam not your best friend.

539
01:00:14.166 --> 01:00:14.666
Hi...

540
01:00:14.666 --> 01:00:16.000
I missed you.

541
01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:21.375
Here you go.

542
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.250
Oh. is it too much? Did I...?

543
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:27.125
Oh. it's my bad. I'm sorry.

544
01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:30.625
It's... It's fine.

545
01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:31.375
ok.

546
01:00:31.541 --> 01:00:33.166
I appreciate the effort.

547
01:00:33.166 --> 01:00:33.791
You are welcome.

548
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.750
So...

549
01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:59.625
When did you get back?

550
01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:24.666
Common. you are surely going to tell me that you missed me
too. I'm sure you did.

551
01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:28.541
I did miss you.

552
01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:34.875
I got in this morning. I honestly couldn't wait to see you.

553
01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:38.291
So. why are you back?

554
01:01:38.875 --> 01:01:40.416
What do you mean?

555
01:01:40.416 --> 01:01:43.416
-I mean. you said that you...
-I know what I said.

556
01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:50.375
You asked me to give you space and time. I gave you the
required space and time don't you think?

557
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.125
What did you expect?

558
01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:56.125
You told me you were never coming back.

559
01:01:56.375 --> 01:01:59.375
Common babe. I said that to get you to come with me.

560
01:02:00.625 --> 01:02:02.625
Clearly I was wrong.

561
01:02:02.625 --> 01:02:04.000
Habib I...

562
01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:17.916
I came back for you.

563
01:02:17.916 --> 01:02:20.500
I came back for us.

564
01:02:22.166 --> 01:02:26.666
I knew when I left you. you wouldn't be
able to do too good without me in the world.

565
01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:33.666
I mean... See babe. we have a lot together and I don't see
any reason why we should throw that away.

566
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:37.250
I want to do good by us. I want to take care of you.

567
01:02:52.416 --> 01:02:55.416
Well. we definitely need to take you shopping.

568
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:58.666
I mean. It's dinner baby and...

569
01:02:58.666 --> 01:03:01.666
I mean. you look like you are dressed like one of those
girls.

570
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.750
Oh no. That's not how it was supposed to sound. It didn't
come out right.

571
01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:07.541
I mean. I want to spoil my girl.

572
01:03:07.541 --> 01:03:10.125
I've missed you now common.

573
01:03:10.125 --> 01:03:12.375
Spend my money now. What is your problem?

574
01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:14.625
Habib stop.

575
01:03:18.166 --> 01:03:24.250
So the plan is to quit my job after I'm done with this
presentation.

576
01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:27.916
...and start my own company with my guys.

577
01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.791
That is great. I mean you'll have enough time to do the
things that really matter to you.

578
01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:38.291
-That's the plan.
-Thank you.

579
01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.500
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

580
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.541
Your mum would be so proud.

581
01:03:51.416 --> 01:03:55.125
Zainab... Zainab told me about... Uhm...

582
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.500
What about your... your dad and your sisblings?

583
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:06.000
Well... It was always just my mum and I.

584
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.291
-I have something I want to tell you.
-No. Actually. I have something I want to tell you and...

585
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.750
...I need to get it off my chest before... before I chicken
out again.

586
01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:29.625
Uhm... Ok.

587
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:40.875
Hey. Just trust me. Whatever I want to tell you can wait.

588
01:04:44.666 --> 01:04:45.500
Uhm...

589
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.375
Bianca. the past few weeks...

590
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:52.750
...have been the most amazing weeks of... of my life.

591
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.250
And literally...

592
01:04:57.250 --> 01:05:01.041
Every moment has been so.. wonderful.

593
01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:03.750
And...

594
01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:09.791
And every day that I've spent with you has been the best
days of my life.

595
01:05:12.916 --> 01:05:16.791
Well. Bianca you make me so happy.

596
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.875
Youve... opened up a... a space in my heart.

597
01:05:22.041 --> 01:05:26.166
And I want you to work through that space and...

598
01:05:26.666 --> 01:05:30.250
Make the space in my heart your home.

599
01:05:35.125 --> 01:05:37.500
And if you let me...

600
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.250
If you let me. I want to be the one.

601
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.250
The one that you call partner and...

602
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:49.250
Now I feel like I'm talking too much.

603
01:06:09.416 --> 01:06:12.416
I thought you'll never say anything.

604
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I don't know... What if i love him?

605
01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:13.125
But I know that I want to be with him. if that makes sense.
Does it make sense?

606
01:10:13.875 --> 01:10:16.875
That sounds like love to me.

607
01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:20.250
Stop... Stop... Zainab!

608
01:10:20.666 --> 01:10:24.375
Bianca. falling in love with a mere mortal. Wow!

609
01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:27.791
Whatever happened to trying to focus and being youself.

610
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.625
-You are loosing focus.
-I'm not loo... I'm not loosing focus

611
01:10:33.041 --> 01:10:36.500
That's the thing. With him. I am myself.

612
01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:40.125
-Like... I feel like...
-Caramel.

613
01:10:43.125 --> 01:10:46.125
What's wrong?

614
01:10:47.125 --> 01:10:50.125
-What did you say?
-Caramel.

615
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.125
It has come to my attention that you are developing a
personal app with company resources.

616
01:10:57.166 --> 01:11:02.000
Ma. I have never used company rresources for my personal
gain.

617
01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:06.250
-I don't understand were...
-Z Capitals.

618
01:11:06.375 --> 01:11:08.625
Not only are you developing an app

619
01:11:08.625 --> 01:11:12.791
You had the audacity to pitch this to Z capitals.

620
01:11:12.791 --> 01:11:15.791
-I...
-That is the same idea you pitched to me.

621
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:19.041
-I did not use company resources.

622
01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:22.041
The app has been registered as the company's IP.

623
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.875
-Ma. with all due respect...
-You're fired.

624
01:11:24.875 --> 01:11:29.125
I don't want to ever see your face in this office again.

625
01:11:29.916 --> 01:11:31.166
Fired?

626
01:11:39.666 --> 01:11:44.166
A staff of ours saw a very inappropriate drawing with
Emmanuel.

627
01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:49.416
We believe it was uhm... part of the drawings that your
friend donated to the children.

628
01:11:49.541 --> 01:11:50.250
Yes?

629
01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:54.125
Uhm... Can i see this drawing?

630
01:11:55.416 --> 01:11:57.500
Hmmm... You most certainly can.

631
01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:39.500
Bianca. we appreciate all of this that he is doing but this
is ungodly.

632
01:12:39.625 --> 01:12:42.625
It should not have found it's way into this orphanage.

633
01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:46.416
And you... You are a good girl. What are you
doing mingling with people like this?

634
01:12:46.416 --> 01:12:50.750
Yes please! Return it to him. Thank you.

635
01:12:51.125 --> 01:12:51.916
Urgh!

636
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:18.250
How dare you?

637
01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:19.375
Listen. I can explain.

638
01:13:19.375 --> 01:13:21.500
How long have you known?

639
01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:25.875
How long have you known?

640
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.500
Abel. how long have you known?!

641
01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:31.500
Since your birthday.

642
01:13:34.375 --> 01:13:37.666
How dare you bring this to my work?

643
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
My life. the kids. Emmanuel!

644
01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:47.250
What type of dirty minded person are you?

645
01:13:49.041 --> 01:13:51.125
Dirty minded?

646
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:55.750
That's so crazy coming from you.

647
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
You are the one that pays to get satisfied.

648
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.541
And you... you are the one that... that shows your nakedness
to every Tom. Dick and Harry online for...for a fee.

649
01:14:06.166 --> 01:14:10.500
I could have easily paid for your time last night like I've
been paying since the day that I started talking to you.

650
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.166
So please...

651
01:14:12.166 --> 01:14:15.666
Please don't come at me with this self righteous talk.

652
01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.625
-Look. listen. I shouldnt have said that...

653
01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.875
Fuck you!

654
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:32.125
Here I was...

655
01:14:32.125 --> 01:14:35.041
Thinking that this was something special.

656
01:14:35.041 --> 01:14:35.875
It is.

657
01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:39.375
I really thought that this was it...

658
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.625
Do you know what's funny?

659
01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:51.625
The most amazing things always turn out to be a lie.

660
01:14:55.875 --> 01:14:58.875
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

661
01:16:09.541 --> 01:16:10.500
B.

662
01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:12.125
B. are you alright?

663
01:16:12.125 --> 01:16:14.125
-Hmmm.
-Are you alright?

664
01:16:15.125 --> 01:16:18.125
Yeah. Why?

665
01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:21.125
You seem a bit lost.

666
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Uhm...

667
01:16:24.666 --> 01:16:28.125
It's... I'm fine. It's just...

668
01:16:29.291 --> 01:16:33.375
Uhm... Fudraiser at work has me worried about the kids.

669
01:16:38.166 --> 01:16:42.791
You kow what? I don't understand why you don't want me to
help.

670
01:16:44.375 --> 01:16:49.375
And the thing is. if it comes to you and the things you care
about. money is not a problem.

671
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.416
So. let me help. Please.

672
01:16:54.416 --> 01:16:57.416
I do't want to bother you.

673
01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:04.625
I'm fine. I'm fine.

674
01:17:05.416 --> 01:17:08.416
Let's watch. Let's watch.

675
01:17:18.666 --> 01:17:21.666

676
01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:27.750
Listen. Bianca please I...

678

Please open the door.

679
01:17:35.416 --> 01:17:38.416
Bianca please I'm sorry. Please I'm sorry.

685
01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:20.250
Stop!

686
01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:32.625

688
01:20:02.166 --> 01:20:03.250
I'm sorry.

689
01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:12.250
Have some water.

690
01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:26.000
Sorry.

691
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Thank you so much for coming.

692
01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:44.916
Thank you for coming when you did Abel because if you didn't
come. I don't know what would have happened to me.

693
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:49.750
And you came just at the right time.

694
01:20:55.666 --> 01:20:58.666
The right time.

695
01:21:10.791 --> 01:21:14.250
How did you know the right time?

696
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.500
Were you watching?

697
01:21:34.166 --> 01:21:35.791
Leave.

698
01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:39.750
-Bianca please I...
-Abel just leave.

699
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:47.750
-I'm sorry.
-Leave!

700
01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:00.250
Hey. I got here as soon as I could. I'm so sorry.

701
01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:03.416
I'm so so sorry...

702
01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:09.041
Who is he?

703
01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:15.250
My ame is Abel. I'm her neighbor and I just...

704
01:22:16.666 --> 01:22:18.750
I just saved her.

705
01:22:19.875 --> 01:22:21.875
-You are...
-Thaks. I appreciate.

706
01:22:22.041 --> 01:22:23.125
Habib.

707
01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:27.250
Bianca is my childhood sweet heart.

708
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.166
And my girlfriend.

709
01:22:31.666 --> 01:22:34.666
Babe. Bianca. what is he...
-Abel. you've done enough.

710
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.625
-You can leave now.
-Sorry.

711
01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:42.166
-But Bianca. I...
-Thank you so much. We really do appreciate.

712
01:22:42.375 --> 01:22:43.916
Bruv. thanks.

713
01:22:43.916 --> 01:22:45.041
Sorry.

714
01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.541
Sorry.

715
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.125
You'll be fine.

716
01:23:06.375 --> 01:23:08.916
Caramel is such a cutie.

717
01:23:08.916 --> 01:23:11.916
She's well grown and everything.

718
01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:18.750
I doubt she even remembers me.

719
01:23:27.875 --> 01:23:30.875
I thought you had moved passed all these.

720
01:23:32.666 --> 01:23:36.875
I mean. I offered to help but you said you had everything
under control.

721
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:41.250
Why didn't you want my help?

722
01:23:44.416 --> 01:23:45.916
You know what?

723
01:23:55.666 --> 01:23:58.666
Yeah. Here you go.

724
01:24:10.375 --> 01:24:13.375
Habib. you didn't have to.

725
01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.875
My contribution to the orphanage?

726
01:24:49.625 --> 01:24:52.625
Marry me?

727
01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:58.000
Please.

728
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:18.041
What you did was ungodly. It is a sin.

729
01:25:19.375 --> 01:25:22.375
I'm sorry mama.

730
01:25:22.916 --> 01:25:25.916
First. it was your friend and his...

731
01:25:26.041 --> 01:25:30.375
Look. I kow you meant well but you did it i a ungodly way.

732
01:25:33.916 --> 01:25:35.125
Mama. I...

733
01:25:36.125 --> 01:25:38.500
I did it for the kids.

734
01:25:39.541 --> 01:25:41.375
For the centre.

735
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:45.250
-For you.
-I kow Bianca. I know.

736
01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:50.875
Look. Honestly. we have to let you go.

737
01:25:51.416 --> 01:25:53.666
For the sake of the children.

738
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Ok... I'm sorry Bianca. I'm sorry.

739
01:26:01.416 --> 01:26:02.875
I understand

740
01:26:15.250 --> 01:26:18.250
That's a friends' contribution.

741
01:26:18.541 --> 01:26:21.541
As part of the donation.

742
01:26:26.875 --> 01:26:28.125
Wow!

743
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.125
Thak you very much for everything Bianca. Thank you.

744
01:26:44.375 --> 01:26:47.750
You paid to have a good time and not chat.

745
01:26:49.375 --> 01:26:51.000
I don't have time for this.

746
01:27:37.875 --> 01:27:40.000
Yes. What is it?

747
01:27:40.416 --> 01:27:44.375
Uh... I wanted to thank you for the other day. For what you
did for her. Really appreciate that.

748
01:27:46.166 --> 01:27:47.291
Yeah.

749
01:27:49.125 --> 01:27:52.125
Oh. I saw your sketch of her by the way. It was beautiful I
must say.

750
01:27:54.291 --> 01:27:57.750
Don't be surprised. I mean. we literally tell ourselves
everything.

751
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:58.625
Yeah.

752
01:28:01.375 --> 01:28:03.541
She has agreed to marry me by the way.

753
01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:06.291
Why are you telling me this?

754
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.125
I know you like her.

755
01:28:09.166 --> 01:28:11.125
I'm sure you are in love with her by now.

756
01:28:11.125 --> 01:28:13.541
I fell in love with her from the first day I saw her.

757
01:28:14.041 --> 01:28:17.500
So... Kindly respect the fact that she's mine now.

758
01:28:21.916 --> 01:28:24.916
Respect that. Yeah...

759
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
What is this now? How come you don't have any alcohol in
your house?

760
01:29:42.291 --> 01:29:45.291
Well. maybe it's because I don't drink alcohol.

761
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.375
So... wait.

762
01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:51.250
All those while you went partying with your babe. you didn't
drink right?

763
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:58.250
Chiboy. what is it? what's up?

764
01:30:02.541 --> 01:30:05.541
Lanre got a promotion.

765
01:30:09.375 --> 01:30:10.541
How?

766
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:16.250
He is the one that told them about the app.

767
01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:19.250
And how you got Z Capital to...

768
01:30:19.625 --> 01:30:21.125
...fund you.

769
01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:24.166
Apparently. he said you stole it.

770
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:27.041
That it was his idea.

771
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:31.500
Wow! That doesn't even make any sense.

772
01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:35.041
But Mrs. Yemi is ready to buy every BS he is selling.

773
01:30:35.125 --> 01:30:40.125
See. that Lanre guy is such a slimey snake. He is... he is
such a sneaky...

774
01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:44.500
Abel.

775
01:30:57.125 --> 01:31:00.125
Guy. what are you going to do now?

776
01:31:00.666 --> 01:31:03.666
What can I do? It's not like she will forgive me.

777
01:31:04.791 --> 01:31:07.791
You'll be here

778
01:31:08.125 --> 01:31:11.125
Forgive my French. Sorry.

779
01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:13.875
Listen Chiboy. I have something to tell you.

780
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:14.625
Let me get a cup. I'm coming.

781
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:17.750
Lanre is the one that almost raped Bianca.

782
01:31:23.875 --> 01:31:24.750
What did you say?

783
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.500
Ufortuately. his face didn't appear in all those videos that
tended online.

784
01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:32.500
So. there's no evidence to pin him down.

785
01:31:35.375 --> 01:31:41.500
I don't understand. Like Lanre... Lanre... like Lanre that
works in the office. Our Lanre...

786
01:31:43.916 --> 01:31:45.375
You are serious.

787
01:31:47.125 --> 01:31:48.750
Lanre that doesn't talk.

788
01:31:48.791 --> 01:31:51.791
He acts like he doesn't notice girls.

789
01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:55.166
Remember that day. He was acting like he didn't see Bianca.

790
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:57.250
Now the thing is...

791
01:31:57.875 --> 01:31:58.916
Who else...?

792
01:32:01.625 --> 01:32:04.625
He gives me the vibe of someone that has even tried it
before.

793
01:32:16.041 --> 01:32:19.041
There's no point asking how you sleep at night because you
clearly don't sleep.

794
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:25.666
First of all. you steal my app and then you get me fired
and like that's not enough. you almost raped Bianca.

795
01:32:26.375 --> 01:32:28.875
The least you can do is just apologize.

796
01:32:28.916 --> 01:32:30.166
Wait... wait...

797
01:32:30.375 --> 01:32:33.375
No! You'll look at me when I'm talking to you. You'll look
at me whe I'm talking to you Lanre.

798
01:32:33.541 --> 01:32:36.541
Wow! So you expect me to apologize?

799
01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:39.500
For what exeactly?

800
01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:43.541
And as for that slut Bianca...

801
01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:46.500
Common bro. you should know better.

802
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.500
Those kind of girls are not meant to be held unto. They are
meant to be passed on. Please!

803
01:32:51.875 --> 01:32:54.875
Wait. is it Bianca... is it Bianca you are talking about
like that?

804
01:32:56.291 --> 01:33:00.791
-Is it Bianca you are talking about?
-Hey hey... No no...

805
01:33:00.791 --> 01:33:03.791
-What is going on here now?
-Really... really...

806
01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.041
Guys... what is this?

807
01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:12.375
Wait. I think you should ask your guy. No. ask your guy.

808
01:33:12.375 --> 01:33:15.750
-Abel what? Lanre what is this now?
-No... I think you should ask Abel.

809
01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:17.875
-Ask him.
-What is it?

810
01:33:17.875 --> 01:33:23.625
You can imagine. Abel is accusing me of stealing his app and
attempted rape. Really?

811
01:33:23.625 --> 01:33:27.750
Rape? Rape! That's such a strong word guy. What is it?

812
01:33:28.375 --> 01:33:29.625
Tell me.

813
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:32.750
Show me your evidence. Where is your evidence?

814
01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:37.500
I mean... I mean look at you. Just look at you. That
caramelslide or whatever her name is...

815
01:33:38.625 --> 01:33:44.666
She has brainwashed you. You don't have sense again and now
you've lost your job and you can't even handle yourself
again.

816
01:33:45.125 --> 01:33:48.125
Wait... isn't it the same girl we saw at yours the other
day?

817
01:33:49.250 --> 01:33:53.666
The same caramelslide that wants to get married to Habib
Olusegun or whatever his name is.

818
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:57.750
My guy. you are messing up! You are messing up!

819
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:59.875
Why are you trying to kill yourself over that girl now?

820
01:34:00.166 --> 01:34:03.166
Everybody knows that the girl is a public toilet. You
know...

821
01:34:03.291 --> 01:34:08.541
If it were me Chibueze Maduka aka Chiboy. I'd have done
worse than what you are accusing Lanre of.

822
01:34:10.166 --> 01:34:12.541
-For what reason? Have you seen that girl?
-Common...

823
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.375
It doesn't make sense. You have to calm down.

824
01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:20.000
Exactly my point. That's what I have been telling this guy.
Guy. this girl is a public property.

825
01:34:20.250 --> 01:34:21.000
Yes.

826
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Either by choice or by force. I chose the latter.

827
01:34:24.041 --> 01:34:25.125
Yes.

828
01:34:25.541 --> 01:34:30.625
Let her thank her stars. If not for you. I'd have licked her
anyhow.

829
01:34:30.916 --> 01:34:32.875
-Can you hear what he is saying?
-Yeah.

830
01:34:32.875 --> 01:34:34.750
-You are disgusting...!
-I'll lick her.

831
01:34:34.875 --> 01:34:37.875
-What are you going to do?
-You are disgusting. You belong in the gutter.

832
01:34:48.041 --> 01:34:51.375
Ma. you took a lot of time. They almost killed me.

833
01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:52.875
Good evening ma.

834
01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:57.500
I heard everything. Thanks for the call Chibueze placed to
me.

835
01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:01.416
You know. It's the audacity for me.

836
01:35:01.416 --> 01:35:06.416
I do not want you to set your ugly foot in my company ever
again.

837
01:35:07.125 --> 01:35:08.500
Do you understand me?

838
01:35:08.666 --> 01:35:10.375
You are fired!

839
01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:11.500
Thank you ma.

840
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.375
You are still fired.

841
01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:16.500
That's abasolutely fine ma.

842
01:35:16.916 --> 01:35:20.791
Ma. Sorry. I don't kow if i'll see small change. So that I
can buy painkiller.

843
01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:28.750
Bro. it's not over. let me just let you know now. It's not
over...

844
01:35:37.166 --> 01:35:40.166
Guy. you've finally been served.

845
01:35:41.875 --> 01:35:44.875
I'll just take a cab.

846
01:36:41.041 --> 01:36:44.041
Habib is a great guy.

847
01:36:45.125 --> 01:36:47.625
Caring. loving...

848
01:36:48.625 --> 01:36:51.625
Literally every womans dream but...

849
01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:59.250
He is not my dream.

850
01:37:06.125 --> 01:37:08.625
We are getting married in a few days and...

851
01:37:09.375 --> 01:37:15.916
I know they say a broken relationship is better tha a broken
marriage but...

852
01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:23.625
Habib has been so good to me.

853
01:38:04.041 --> 01:38:07.625
Habib. You shouldn't be here

854
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.375
-It's not good for the groom to see the bride...
-...before the ceremoy.

855
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:15.875
Well. forgive me. I couldn't help myself.

856
01:38:19.375 --> 01:38:21.416
You look beautiful.

857
01:38:23.125 --> 01:38:25.625
You're lucky to have me as your husband.

858
01:38:25.791 --> 01:38:28.791
As I am lucky to have you as my wife.

859
01:38:30.875 --> 01:38:33.875
This is how I want

860
01:40:11.791 --> 01:40:15.916
Remember how we met? Remember how we started?

861
01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:19.625
We used to be all over ourselves.

862
01:40:23.875 --> 01:40:28.000
Let's make us work B. please.

863
01:40:37.416 --> 01:40:39.250
let's make this work.

864
01:40:42.875 --> 01:40:45.500
This ring marks our agreement...

865
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:48.416
