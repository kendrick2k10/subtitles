00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.700
Oh my God. Jimmy! So nice of you to come pick me up.
I missed you!

4
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.800
Good to see you Stacy Miller. How was the flight?

5
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:44.700
Jimmy Cloud! I asked you million times to just call me Stacy.
You know. calling me by my full name annoys me.

6
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.600
The trip was fine. thank you. Nothing exciting.

7
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.800
Good to hear. Stacy.

8
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.100
How are you? You seem tired.

9
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.900
Did you come straight from work Mr. Detective?

10
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Yeah. I just finished up but now I`ve got some free time.

11
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.000
I would have been okay. really.
Chasing all those bad guys around:

12
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.700
Gangsters. spies. murderers. pimps. prostitutes. dealers. terrorists.
You should be resting!

13
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.100
Stacy... what are friends for?

14
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.000
Really though. I appreciate it.
You`re a great friend. Jimmy.

15
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.500
So. are you hungry?

16
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.200
I`m starving! Airplane food sucks.

17
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.600
How about that burger restaurant?
You know. your favorite?

18
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Oh yes please! I missed their burgers so much.

19
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.800
I knew it!

20
00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:34.000
Jimmy! You crack me up.

21
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.000
... and afterwards we`ll meet some friends at a bar.
How`s that sound?

22
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.000
Sounds like a plan. I'm in!

23
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.900
Alright. Let's go then.

24
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.000
How was the job?

25
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.700
Very nice! I was shooting a big campaign for a client.

26
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.500
Congrats! Who are they?

27
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.200
You`re silly. I`m not allowed to say because of the contract.
You know. my job. I`m sorry Jimmy.

28
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.000
The terms are strict. I know Stacy.
You`ve told me this before.

29
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.100
I've met some very nice and interesting people!

30
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.300
Sounds good! How long are you staying?

31
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800
Only a week.

32
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.400
What`s your next job?

33
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600
A fashion show.

34
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.000
Oh that`s right!
I remember you told me about that one.

35
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.700
Yeah baby! I'm so excited.
It`s a dream come true for me.

36
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.800
I'm very happy for you!
I`ll drive you to the airport again if you want.

37
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.400
Sure. thanks!

38
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.600
Any time.

39
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.600
Let`s go.

40
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.000
Always a gentleman!

41
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.600
Be careful with that suitcase!

42
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.500
Something precious in there?

43
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.300
Yeah. some clothes. And very expensive lingerie.

44
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.500
Oh. I see. Sounds interesting.

45
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.000
That`s for sure. we`ll save that for the evening.

46
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.000
Ok.

47
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.600
Is everything ok?

48
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.300
All good. Just could we stop by my apartment first.
so I can take a quick shower. please?

49
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I also want to wear something else.

50
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.100
Of course! We`ve still got time.

51
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.800
Foood! Burgers and booze at the bar!

52
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.900
Thank you.

53
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.200
I wait here for you.

54
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.300
Don`t you want to come in?

55
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.500
No. We`ll save that for later.

56
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.200
Ok. I`ll be right back!

57
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.600
Crystal!

58
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.200
Jimmy. have you made any progress finding my sister?

59
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.300
It’s now been two weeks since she ran off with that dealer
and you haven’t given me any news.

60
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.200
Look. I’ve been chasing down leads but none have panned out.

61
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.800
Don’t worry – I’ll find her. The guy is probably lying low –
they will turn up sooner or later.

62
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.300
Come on now. you can’t keep blaming yourself.
Sissy is a grown woman – she’ll do what she wants.

63
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.700
Jimmy. you need to spend more time looking for Sissy.
Is it that you need more money?

64
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.400
Just say how much! You’ve got to find her!
You’ve got to!

65
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.800
Crystal. money isn’t the issue – it just takes time
to scour the seamy underside of this city.

66
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.900
I’ll let you know when it`s time to kick more cash into the search.
Have faith – I will find Sissy.

67
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.200
I’ve gotta go now. Crystal.
I’ll call you as soon as I know something.

68
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:49.000
Jimmy. you’re my only hope. I’ll be waiting for your call.
Don’t let me down. Bye.

69
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.500
Bye.

70
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.700
The name`s Sandra. Sandra Cox.

71
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.600
Jimmy. Nice to meet you.

72
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Nice to meet you too. Mr. Jimmy.

73
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.200
Just Jimmy. Sandra. You look very familiar.
Do we know each other?

74
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:31.700
I don`t think so.
But we`ll get to know each other real soon Jimmy.

75
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Precious... You have no idea!

76
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.800
Be calm or you`re dead!

77
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.800
I'm not playing around. Do you understand?

78
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.200
I`ve got her. Let him know. now!

79
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.000
Very good. Roger. Message received.

80
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.100
You have a pretty girlfriend.

81
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.700
What?

82
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.200
Girlfriend? What are you talking about?

83
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.000
We`ve got Stacy.

84
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
You bastards!

85
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.100
And if you make one wrong move she`ll die.
Understand Detective Cloud?

86
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.800
What the hell! Where is she?
What did you do to her?

87
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.800
And she`s not my girlfriend.
We're just good friends.

88
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.400
We`ve got her.
And if you don`t put your gun away she`ll die.

89
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.600
Now get dressed! Hurry up!
We have to go. now!

90
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:48.500
Don't do anything stupid or I`ll blow your brains out.
Believe me. I will!

91
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.600
I only have to make one move.

92
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.200
You bitch. you`ll regret it!

93
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.800
Hurry up! We`ve got to go!

94
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:10.900
I'm ready.

95
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.000
Fucking bitch!

96
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.200
Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

97
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.400
Come on Sandra...
Come on. come on... come on!

98
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.100
Jimmy!

99
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.800
Stacy!

100
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.000
He`s coming!

101
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.000
Who`s coming?

102
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.600
The... the gang... gangster!

103
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.800
He... he`s after me!

104
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.600
Are you ok? Did that bastard hurt you?

105
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.900
Don't worry about me. We have to leave.
We have to call the police!

106
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.400
Forget them. They're all corrupt. I`m the police.
Where can I find him?

107
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.100
He... he was in my apartment. There. upstairs.

108
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.300
Ok. wait here. I`ll be back.

109
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.800
She`s gone... Yes. I follow her.

110
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.500
Fucking shit!

111
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.100
Don`t move. you fucking bastard!
Who sent you?

112
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.200
Razor. my boss.
You and your little bitch are dead!

113
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.800
Tell your boss that I will find him.
And now piss off!

114
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.700
Looking for some fun. handsome?

115
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.600
Sure. we could have a party.

116
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.200
No thanks...

117
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.300
But... do you know where Janet is?

118
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.300
She`s over there.

119
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:15.500
Come on bitch! Come... come on bitch...

120
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.400
Fuck off. pig!

121
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.200
Argh!

122
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.300
Stay down!

123
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.800
You fucking prick!
You smell like whiskey and weed.

124
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:26.800
Argh!

125
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.700
Are you ok. lady?

126
00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:29.500
I`m fine.

127
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.800
Janet?

128
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.000
Detective Cloud...

129
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.500
What are you doing here?

130
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.100
I`m working undercover.

131
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.600
Is it that case with the bastard who`s killing prostitutes?

132
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.800
Yes. What are you doing up this late?

133
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.000
I`m looking for someone.

134
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.400
Who? Is it personal? Or for the Police?

135
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.500
A bit of both.

136
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.500
I`ll help you.

137
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.200
Thank you Janet.
What do you know about Razor Martinez?

138
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:13.100
I know that he already controls big parts of the city.
Even though he`s new here. From Mexico.

139
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.200
Know anybody who knows more?
Every piece of information matters.

140
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.000
Yes. Dectective Victoria Barnes.

141
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.100
Alright. thanks.
My colleague the Drug Detective...

142
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.000
Yeah. She`s undercover right now. a few blocks away.

143
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.300
But you can count on me Jimmy!
Just let me know.

144
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Great. thank you.

145
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
You`re welcome.

146
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.600
Hey guys! I hope you`ve got good news for me.

147
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.400
Well boss...

148
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.700
Razor. not exactly.

149
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.000
You idiots! You`re useless!

150
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.800
I'm sorry boss!

151
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.500
Rico let her get away.

152
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:09.500
You useless idiot!... It doesn't matter.
I want them dead or alive! Do you understand?

153
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.500
Yes boss!

154
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.500
We do.

155
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.500
Leave... before I do something stupid and kill you too!

156
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.600
Get the fuck out of here!
Razor Martinez has spoken.

157
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.600
Ok. Should we let the others know?

158
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.300
Yes! Let everyone know...

159
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:42.800
I`m offering one million to whoever brings me Jimmy Cloud
and his model girlfriend bitch Stacy Miller dead.

160
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.700
Ok. Anything else?

161
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:54.300
Yes. Three million to whoever brings them to me alive!
So I can kill them myself.

162
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.000
Undestood.

163
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.300
Get the fuck out of here!

164
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.300
Damiana. you`re my best. Get me this gringo fucker!

165
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.000
Si boss. It will be done.

166
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.100
Bianca!

167
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:18.400
Yes. Razor. What do you want from me?

168
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.600
Clean up this mess from the floor.
What are you waiting for? Now!

169
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.600
You did this shit. Do it yourself.

170
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.500
You want to end up like this too?

171
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.500
Alright boss.

172
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.100
Good girl. And bring me more Tequilla!

173
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.700
Do what he's telling you or I'll make
your life a living hell!

174
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.800
Clean it up. now!

175
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.900
Alright. I`ll do it.

176
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.100
Finally!... More Tequilla!

177
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.800
Thanks Laura. baby!

178
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.100
I care about you Razor. I know what you want!

179
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.400
Yes... Quality testing!

180
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.100
Oh Jimmy. You and your dangerous. shitty job.

181
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
They want to kill me... They`re after me.

182
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:40.000
But you could be a great father!...
You`re so experienced and mature...

183
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:51.400
Stacy Cloud... No! Stacy Miller Cloud.
I`ve got a career on my back...

184
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.300
Stacy?...

185
00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.900
Jimmy?...

186
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.400
Yes baby. it's me!

187
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Baby?...

188
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.500
I love you Stacy...
I want to start a family with you!

189
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.100
But... your job. Jimmy... I love you too!

190
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.600
I'm going to kill you. you fucking cunt!

191
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.600
Oh my god! Get away from me you dirty pig!

192
00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.000
Oh my God! Oh my God... oh my God...

193
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.800
What a terrible nightmare...

194
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.400
Who is it?

195
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.800
It's me. Jimmy. Can you open the door. please?

196
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.200
Oh... Sure... Give me a minute!

197
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Hi Stacy.

198
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.000
Jimmy. hi! Sorry to keep you waiting.

199
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.600
I need a drink.

200
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.100
There`s beers in the fridge? Do you...

201
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.900
Want one?

202
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
No thanks. I don`t want to drink anything right now.

203
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.100
Stacy. you can't stay here.

204
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:30.000
What? Why?... Dont`t say that Jimmy...
I love you.

205
00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.100
They`re after you because they`re after me.
I`m responsible for what happened.

206
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.800
I want to stay with you forever. Jimmy!
To protect me from evil.

207
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.500
To wake up in the morning together and
wait for you to come back from work.

208
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.200
It can't live like that.
I lost family because of these fucking criminals.

209
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.900
You mean those terrorists who killed your family?

210
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.600
Yes. those bastards I put in jail.

211
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.500
They killed my parents and my brother. and heavily
wounded some co-workers of mine. All for revenge.

212
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.300
I`m so sorry. Jimmy.

213
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:31.000
I don't want anything to happen to you. We can't have
a normal relationship. It`s too dangerous for you.

214
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.600
If your job stops us from being together. then quit.

215
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.100
Are you insane?... No. I can't. Forget it.

216
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.000
Why?

217
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.600
I have to hunt them all down.
Justice must be served.

218
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.000
I understand.

219
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.200
Yes sure. the bathroom is there.

220
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.500
I have work to do.

221
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.600
What?... No. it`s late. Please don't go!

222
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.300
The criminals never sleep.

223
00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.500
Stacy. I want you to have this.

224
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.500
Oh! Your gun?

225
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:46.100
Use this to protect yourself until I come again.
Please stay here in your apartment.

226
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.500
And call me if something happens.

227
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.000
Ok Jimmy... I will.

228
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.700
Ok. I have to go now. Bye.

229
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.600
Hey Jimmy. Long time no see!

230
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.500
Indeed. How are you. Victoria?

231
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.500
On duty. as you can see.
The case is secret. I can't talk about it.

232
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.600
I understand.
Victoria... I've got an urgent case.

233
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800
What`s it about?

234
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.200
Do you know something about a ganster named Razor?

235
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.600
Ah... You mean The Mexican Devil.

236
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.200
"The Mexican Devil"?

237
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.300
That`s what he`s called on the Street.

238
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:43.000
They say he's not human because of his
extreme aggressiveness and criminal energy.

239
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.200
Interesting. Tell me more.

240
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:50.700
"Drug Lord" from Mexico. He came here
a few months ago and wants to take over the city.

241
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.700
And he`s doing well. Janet Walker told me.

242
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.600
Jimmy... everything ok?

243
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.500
I`ve gotta find him. That god-damn bastard!...
Do you know where he is?

244
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.700
And it has to be you?
You`re going alone after this devil?

245
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:12.600
You know how it is. You can`t rely on
anyone anymore. and almost everyone is corrupt.

246
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.500
But you can't do it alone. He has hitmen!

247
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.100
I`ve got Janet.

248
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.100
Well. you can count on me. too.

249
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.400
Victoria. do you know where to find him?

250
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.500
He`s based out of a night club called "Escalado".
a few blocks north from here.

251
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.800
Ok. I`ll go and get him.

252
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.800
Be careful. Detective Cloud!

253
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.400
Yeah. thanks. Bye.

254
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.500
Good luck.

255
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:47.900
Razor. he`s coming by. I`ll bring him personally.
Yes. alive. Get the money ready.

256
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:57.100
Who`s that now... It can`t be Jimmy...
I gave him the key.

257
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.300
Who`s there?

258
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.600
It`s Sandra!

259
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.900
I don't know any "Sandra"...

260
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.000
I`m your new neighbour. We just moved in.
I need some help with my apartment.

261
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.600
New neighbour?... Oh fuck.

262
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:24.600
Can you let me in? I know it`s late but it`s
an emergency and my husband is working... please?

263
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:27.300
Ok!... Give me a minute!...

264
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.200
Ok. I`ll wait. Thank you!

265
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.600
Hi. I`m Stacy. How can I help you?

266
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.300
You fucking bitch. go inside!

267
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.300
Ha ha. stupid bitch!

268
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:15.600
Is everything alright?... Can I help you?...
My name is Julie Andrews. I'm a doctor.

269
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:21.600
Oh no. thank you Julie. My friend is just drunk.
She drinks a little more than she should...

270
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.800
She doesn't look drunk... This woman`s in shock!

271
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.400
She's just really very drunk.
We don't need your help. thanks!

272
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.600
Let me help you. You look like you need
an experienced helping hand!

273
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.800
Ok bitch... go away or I'll blow your fucking brains out.
And be quiet!

274
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.800
Ok... ok. ok! Cool down.

275
00:28:44.801 --> 00:28:46.100
And be quiet!

276
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.500
Ok. I`m leaving.

277
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.200
I`m impressed!

278
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.900
I`m glad boss.

279
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.200
Is she?...

280
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.400
She`s alive! One and a half million.
I`m waiting.

281
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.000
What are you talking about?...

282
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.700
Razor... you said three million for Jimmy Cloud
and his dumb bitch girlfriend. alive...

283
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:25.000
It`s the price for both of them.
You only brought me one. So you get nothing.

284
00:29:25.001 --> 00:29:27.300
You mexican son of a fucking bitch!

285
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:32.000
You slut. Razor Martinez has never betrayed anyone!

286
00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:35.900
Play by the rules of the night or I`ll end
your despicable life!

287
00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.200
You promised me the money...
You said you`d help me with my family problems.

288
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.200
You should be. sugar. You owe me your life. you whore.
Who do you think you are?

289
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.700
No matter how much people owe you.
you don't own them...

290
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:56.200
Big words coming from a junkie and a hooker.
You`re high Sandra! Drug freak!

291
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Razor... is that you?

292
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.600
Oh baby. So we met again.

293
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:17.800
You gave me drugs when I was desperate in Mexico...
But that doesn`t mean you own me. you bastard.

294
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:25.100
That big mouth of yours is still spitting out bullshit.
Put it to good use. You know what I mean!

295
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.200
You don't own me.

296
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.900
Your loss. hermosa. Your loss.
You and your boyfriend are dead!

297
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.200
Let me go! Jimmy will come rescue me!

298
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:47.600
Oh Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy. help! Help!...
He'll find you and also a lot of bullets in his head!

299
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.200
Who are you?

300
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.600
None of your business.

301
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.400
And where do you think you`re going?

302
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.500
Inside of this stall. Make room.

303
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.200
Victoria? You`re with them?

304
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.000
You fools. I`ve got you!
Don`t make a wrong move now!

305
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.200
Shit... How could I ever trust you. bitch!

306
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.800
Surprise... I could have bet on it!

307
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.500
Drop your weapons slowly or you`re dead.

308
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.000
Move faster. you dogs!

309
00:31:53.200 --> 00:32:00.800
Well. well! Victoria baby!...
What a surprise! Is that Jimmy Cloud? Very nice!

310
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.000
What do you want? Let us go or you'll regret it!

311
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:11.200
Shut up gringo or you`re all dead! I just have to snap
my fingers! Who do you think I am?

312
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:16.200
Hmm. let me think about that for a moment...
Maybe a criminal psychopath?

313
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:23.000
I am the Devil. you little mortal human.
Now show me some respect!

314
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.400
Yes. show him respect!
And us too. while you`re at it!

315
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.800
Never. you megalomaniac junkies!

316
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.700
Ok. if this is what you want. Shoot them!
Kill those clowns!

317
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.400
First Cloud and Walker.

318
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.900
But wait for my command!

319
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.200
Jimmy!... You saved me.

320
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.200
They killed Janet...

321
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.500
It`s not your fault... You`re bleeding.
We need to get you to a hospital!

322
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.200
No. not now... I need a moment.

323
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.000
Alright Jimmy... I understand.

324
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.300
I`ve gotta make a few calls to clean up this mess.

325
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
I'm so glad that's over. Jimmy.
Now maybe we can be together?

326
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:04.400
Sorry Stacy. nothing is over... The criminals are about
to conquer the whole world. I can't stop now.

327
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.400
So we can never be together.

328
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:12.000
Hopefully. one day. the Police will recover
from the corruption.

329
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.800
You saw what happened. Janet is dead.

330
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.300
Also. you should go to rehab to come clean.

331
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.800
So that's the real reason you don't want to be with me!

332
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.800
No. it's just better for you... Let`s go.
