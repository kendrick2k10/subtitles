Enter if you dare (laughs).

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:56.362
Anna. are you sure you
put this folder down here?

won't have my husband kill you.

Anna?
(church bell ringing)

28
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.619
- I was thinking you'd change your mind.

29
00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:31.591
- Well. it had crossed my mind.

30
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:32.936
- You got the money?

31
00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:34.662
- Have I ever let you down before.

32
00:05:34.662 --> 00:05:37.726
- There's always a first time.

33
00:05:37.726 --> 00:05:41.476
- (sighs) Let's get a drink.

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:56.915
I lost my wife too.

38
00:05:56.915 --> 00:05:59.315
it's something you have
to live With day by day.

39
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.670
- My wife was murdered. and
my only daughter kidnapped.

40
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.237
It's not quite the same. is it?

41
00:06:06.122 --> 00:06:07.300
- But they certainly
picked the wrong family

42
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.300
to target this time around. didn't they?

43
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:12.639
But you must be careful not to be caught.

44
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.263
- I'm gonna find my daughter. Edward.

(envelope rustling)
(envelope whooshing)

46
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.547
- That's the rest of the
cash. 5.000 Sterling.

47
00:06:28.213 --> 00:06:31.213
That's all you got for the duration.

48
00:06:33.801 --> 00:06:36.551
- I need more.
- There is no more.

49
00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:39.940
You know Samuel Archer
has got so many people

50
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.773
working for him?

51
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.960
His web covers The globe.

52
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.653
he's even got links to the FBI.

53
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.110
You'll find photographs
of his men in here.

54
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.610
He's chosen a small railroad
town to do their business from

55
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.393
this time around. it's well off the radar.

56
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.340
I've included the location
with the photographs.

57
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.043
but that's all the information we have.

58
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.240

You've tracked human trafficking
gangs your entire career.

that should be total.

62
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.120
- Oh. I'll find them.

63
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.670
- You know. MI5 have produced

64
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.513
some wonderful intelligence
officers over the years.

65
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.470
Don't let what happened
to your wife and daughter

66

just make sure you get the
first train back to London.

92

A cover story is already in place.

93
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.720
We can't have a MI5 agent found

- Understood.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.430
we're just waiting for their response.

179
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.750
- You think they'll buy it.

180
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.600
- I'd imagine so.

181
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.803
as long as you keep your
hands off the merchandise.

182
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.290
- Well. I did it have a good quarter.

183
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.560
I say we can ease our
foot off the gas pedal

184
00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.550
a little bit this month.

185
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.130
Now that Valentine's off the radar.

186
00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.230
it's gonna be a lot easier to do business.

187
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.720
- At the end of the day.
I work for you. Samuel.

188
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.053
I'll do whatever you ask.

189
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.230
- I love it when you say that

190
00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:15.224
- Well. you have 10
minutes to finish this lot.

191
00:14:15.224 --> 00:14:16.607
and then I'll come and get you.

192
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.781
(Samuel sighing)

193
00:14:20.781 --> 00:14:23.227
(door unlatching)
(footsteps thudding)

194
00:14:23.227 --> 00:14:25.894
(door latching)

195
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.940
I'll be ready for you soon.

196
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.110
I hope you're not gonna behave
like this with our guests.

197
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.060
They've come a long way to see you.

198
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.160
and they're willing to pay a lot of money.

199
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.693
- You've got no idea what
you've gotten yourself into.

200
00:14:48.693 --> 00:14:50.170
have you?

201
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.960
- Talking in riddles again.

202
00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.400
- When my father finds
out. I've been taken.

203
00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.500
you're going to find
yourself in a lot of trouble.

204
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.290
- Do you think the other girls
don't say the same thing?

205
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.030
You need to understand we've
been doing this a long time.

206
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.490
and we are very careful.

207
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.310
- This time. it's going to be different.

208
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.143
- How so?

209
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.160
- You'll find out soon enough.

210
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.530
- You're very beautiful. Anna.

211
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.990
but I'll need to tidy you up a bit

212
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.080
before you meet the others.

213
00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.913
- You can keep your hands off me.

214
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.580
- It's best not to fight them. my sweet.

215
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.620
- My advice is to just
go along for the ride.

216
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.230
The girls who survive are the ones

217
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.023
who play the dutiful girlfriend.

218
00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.713
You're about to start a new life.

219
00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.240
The sooner you accept your
sudden change in circumstances.

220
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.890
the better.

221
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.090
If you fight them.
they'll just replace you.

222
00:15:43.425 --> 00:15:45.940
These a rich and powerful
people we're dealing with.

223
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.550
do you understand what I'm telling you?

224
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.451
- I don't need your advice.
- I'm trying to help you.

225
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:53.210
- (sneers) Cut my ropes.
and help me that way.

226
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:55.260
- And risk losing my own life?

227
00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.420
There are limits to my kindness.

228
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.830
- I'm surprised you even sleep at night.

229
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.760
- I play my role. now I
have everything I want.

230
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.363
I suggest you do the same.

231
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.633
- I'd rather die than lose my soul.

232
00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:13.580
(slap thudding)

233
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.880
- Then. you'll learn the hard way.

234
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.400
One day. you'll understand.
I was trying to help.

235
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.310
- I'll be long gone
before that day arrives.

236
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.767
- That's what they all say.

237
00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:25.208
- This time. it's going to be different.

238
00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:27.366
- They all say that too.

239
00:16:27.366 --> 00:16:31.341
- You're going to die. I
want you to understand that.

240
00:16:31.341 --> 00:16:33.669
- I don't frighten easily.

241
00:16:33.669 --> 00:16:38.064
- (chuckles) That's what they all say.

242
00:16:38.064 --> 00:16:43.064
(birds chirping)
(tense dramatic music)

243
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:18.060
- I'm sorry. have we met?

244
00:17:19.328 --> 00:17:21.078
- I don't believe so.

245
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.080
- I would have remembered
your face in this little town.

246
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.230
- I arrived last night.

247
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.403
- I see.
- My name's Kit.

248
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.043
- Simone.

249
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.500
- Sorry. you just remind
me of somebody I once knew.

250
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.323
- Someone nice I hope.
- Very much so.

251
00:17:42.159 --> 00:17:43.950
- Are you here for work. Kit?

252
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.050
- Something like that.

253
00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.760
- Well. it's lovely meeting you.

254
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.760
I should run along now.
- Well. perhaps

255
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.050
we can meet again.

256
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.633
- Yes. I'd like that.

257
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.260
I often take a stroll in the evenings

258
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.093
in one of the local parks.

259
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.520
- Do you have a favorite book?

260
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.470
I'd be interested in making a new friend.

261
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.413
- Maybe Queens park this evening.

262
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.253
Eight might be a good time to try.

263
00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:27.410
(tense ominous music)
(guest yawning)

264
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.893
- I really hope they don't
keep us waiting here all day.

265
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.972
- They're usually very punctual.

266
00:18:33.972 --> 00:18:36.103
- I paid enough money.
I bloody well hope so.

267
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.728
- This is my third time.

268
00:18:39.728 --> 00:18:42.773
The quality is very good. my friend.

269
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.547
- Stand there. and
smile. I guess to say it.

270
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.970
Our guest is here.

271
00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.813
- Wonder.

272
00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.573
- Blimey.

273
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.650
- [Margaret] How nice of you to join us.

274
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.460
- Your team has done well this time.

275
00:19:25.761 --> 00:19:27.678
- [Margaret] Thank you.

276
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.863
- And a very warm welcome to you both.

277
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.980
- The pleasure's all ours.

278
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.090
- Trust you both are happy.
- Absolutely.

279
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.333
- Would you care for a
drink before we start?

280
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.193
- Just a glass of water
for me. I'm a teetotaler.

281
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.740
- Very well.

282
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.550
- [Margaret] Drinks are on their way.

283
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.010
- Thank you. Margaret.

284
00:19:56.518 --> 00:19:58.460
A bite to eat perhaps?

285
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.580
- I have already eaten.

286
00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.413
- Very well.

287
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.573
- I'm very impressed. Samuel.

288
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.483
You have exceeded yourself this time.

289
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:13.500
- Well. we went out of our way

290
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.943
to bring you the very best quality.

291
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.287
We went through a great
deal of trouble (sighs).

292
00:20:23.134 --> 00:20:25.801
(Anna grunting)

293
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.310
- I'm so glad you're both happy.

294
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.360
Can't tell you how pleased that makes me.

295
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.193
- So we'll start the bidding.

296
00:20:37.037 --> 00:20:38.787
I say we get this show on the road.

297
00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.923
- Cool.

298
00:21:00.556 --> 00:21:03.639
(footsteps thudding)

299
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.390
- I didn't think you'd show up.

300
00:21:20.842 --> 00:21:22.342
- I'm not that kind of person.

301
00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.370
I would never agree to meet
someone. then not show.

302
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.870
Wouldn't want that done to me.

303
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.000
- You seem upset. are you okay?

304
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.150
- You're staring at me.

305
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.580
- I'm sorry. you just remind
me of someone very special.

306
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.730
You look just like her.

307
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.563
- Your girlfriend?

308
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.453
- My wife. she was very beautiful.

309
00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:51.363
- I see.

310
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.323
Did she leave you?

311
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.030
- Well. you could put it that way (sighs).

312
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.030
- I don't understand

313
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.570
- She was murdered.

314
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.950
- Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.

315
00:22:04.449 --> 00:22:06.583
I can't imagine what you
must be going through.

316
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.670
- You learn to cope with it.

317
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:10.503
- I couldn't.

318
00:22:12.349 --> 00:22:13.182
- (sighs) Anyway.

319
00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:15.600
Why are you so unhappy?

320
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.853
- Nothing. I.

321
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.230
I just haven't heard back
from my friend today. so.

322
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.110
- I'm sure they'll call.

323
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:28.927
- Yes. I expect they will.

324
00:22:33.113 --> 00:22:34.373
- I've lost you.

325
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.293
- Sorry.

326
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.940
- You look so deep in thought.

327
00:22:40.372 --> 00:22:42.740
- (chuckles) I was thinking of my wife.

328
00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.573
- I understand.

329
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.853
- One day. I'll find the
man that took her life.

330
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.593
- Perhaps that man is out
there looking for you too.

331
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.553
- Oh. I hope so.

332
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.880
- It's not healthy to
hold in all that anger.

333
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.770
- It's what keeps me alive.

334
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.600
- It could end up costing you it.

335
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.137
- I'll take my chances (sighs).

336
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.060
I'm sure your friend'll call.

337
00:23:15.422 --> 00:23:17.982
- You know I wasn't thinking about that.

338
00:23:17.982 --> 00:23:21.640
I was thinking of.

339
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.100
I was thinking that it
would be wise for you

340
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.800
to leave this town as soon
as possible. Mr. Valentine.

341
00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:31.000
- Care you explain why?

342
00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.470
- Sometimes you just can't fight back.

343
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.270
not when they have something on you.

344
00:23:38.124 --> 00:23:40.457
- I'm not sure I follow you.

345
00:23:43.877 --> 00:23:44.903
Are you leaving?

346
00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.960
- I have a lot to do this evening.

347
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:54.143
- I see.

348
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:56.690
- It was lovely meeting you again.

349
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.871
I wish it would have been
under better circumstances.

350
00:24:01.871 --> 00:24:03.760
- The feeling is mutual.

351
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.670
- You're very peculiar.
man. Mr. Valentine.

352
00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.103
- Unusual circumstances
can do that to someone.

353
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.273
- You take care.

354
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.070
I hope you enjoy your
stay in our lovely town.

355
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.230
and I hope someday you find a new love.

356
00:24:19.768 --> 00:24:22.568
- Oh. just when I was beginning
to enjoy my own company.

357
00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:27.433
- You'll find love again
when you least expect it.

358
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.400
Goodbye. Mr. Valentine.

359
00:24:43.396 --> 00:24:48.396
(door unlatching)
(footsteps thudding)

360
00:24:50.466 --> 00:24:53.049
(gun clanking)

361
00:24:59.557 --> 00:25:02.057
(Kit sighing)

362
00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:29.706
- Do you make a habit
of seducing married men?

363
00:25:29.706 --> 00:25:31.840
(Anna chuckling)

364
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.240
- Just when I have the time.

365
00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:38.693
- Why me?

366
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.957
- Why not you?

367
00:25:44.471 --> 00:25:46.570
- I hope you're going to untie me after.

368
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.179
- I won't have to soon.

369
00:25:49.179 --> 00:25:52.012
(knife whooshing)

370
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.826
(door unlatching)
(door creaking)

371
00:25:57.826 --> 00:26:00.493
(door latching)

372
00:26:02.796 --> 00:26:03.629
- Anna?

373
00:26:06.208 --> 00:26:10.610
Anna?
(door unlatching)

374
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:11.443
- Father?

375
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.840
- We agreed not to do this again.

376
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.673
- I'm sorry.

377
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:18.360
- You're promised (pants)!

378
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.610
- You are so weak. Dad. I can't
bear to see you like this.

379
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.380
- It'll pass. you know it'll pass.

380
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.491
- I couldn't stand it. it's
killing me to see you suffer.

381
00:26:27.491 --> 00:26:28.910
- We need to clear this mess
up. before mother gets back.

382
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.470
- Yeah. leave it to me.

383
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.340
I'll have it spotless
before she gets back.

384
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.350
- This has to be the last time.

385
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.240
- You have to feed.

386
00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.330
- This has to be the last
time we do this. Anna.

387
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:40.493
Do you understand?

388
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.760
- Daddy. you know I'd do anything for you.

389
00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.300
- I'm serious. this has to stop.

390
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.233
This is our home. our sanctuary.

391
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:51.800
- I know (sighs).

392
00:26:58.566 --> 00:27:01.886
(person knocking)

393
00:27:01.886 --> 00:27:03.030
- Who is it?

394
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:03.863
- It's me.

395
00:27:05.378 --> 00:27:07.878
(Kit sighing)

396
00:27:08.859 --> 00:27:11.240
(light clicking)

397
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.740
(Kit sighing)

398
00:27:15.065 --> 00:27:16.777
(door unlatching)

399
00:27:16.777 --> 00:27:17.610
Boo.

400
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.390
You really know how to
impress a girl. Kit.

401
00:27:24.384 --> 00:27:27.051
(door latching)

402
00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.160
- Did you follow me?

403
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:32.993
- I did.

404
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.040
- Could you get me a drink?

405
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:37.873
I'd like one.

406
00:27:40.356 --> 00:27:43.083
(bottle clanking)

407
00:27:43.083 --> 00:27:44.220
A glass would be nice.

408
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.370
- Don't push your luck.

409
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.453
- Take a seat. I just
might share this with you.

410
00:27:55.032 --> 00:27:56.632
- I don't really know you. do I?

411
00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.503
- That's funny. I was just
thinking the same thing.

412
00:28:06.254 --> 00:28:08.360
(Kit sighing)

413
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.663
- Have you lived here now long?

414
00:28:11.663 --> 00:28:12.496
- Long enough.

415
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.470
- Didn't want to explore?

416
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.820
It's a big world out there.

417
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.640
- You wouldn't ask that if you
knew how this town operated.

418
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.685
- People run away all the time. were

419
00:28:24.685 --> 00:28:26.153
what makes this town so special?

420
00:28:28.255 --> 00:28:29.088
- If only you knew.

421
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.363
Look. I didn't come
here to be interrogated.

422
00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.030
So let's just stop with all the questions.

423
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.998
- What did you come here for?

424
00:28:38.998 --> 00:28:41.182
(person knocking)

425
00:28:41.182 --> 00:28:43.349
- Well. someone's popular.

426
00:28:46.426 --> 00:28:51.426
- Who is it?

427
00:28:51.524 --> 00:28:53.543
- Who the hell are you?

428
00:28:53.543 --> 00:28:54.873
- I said. who is it?

429
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.833
Yes?

430
00:29:03.833 --> 00:29:06.960
- Someone out there wanted
to see you urgently.

431
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.117
- Does this person have a name?

432
00:29:09.117 --> 00:29:11.190
- Oh. they didn't wanna give me a name?

433
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:13.200
- What does he look like?

434
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.240
- Well. I would say he's in his early 40s.

435
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.310
short black hair. had a stern expression.

436
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.950
Do you know him?

437
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:22.783
- Not yet.

438
00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:25.360
- I'm going.
- You don't have to leave.

439
00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.980
I'll be 10 minutes. wait here for me.

440
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.457
- 10 minutes. that's all I'm giving you.

441
00:29:41.555 --> 00:29:43.355
(door latching)

442
00:29:43.355 --> 00:29:44.960
- That's quite a catch.

443
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.793
- Not my type.

444
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.023
- I said that about my wife 20 years ago.

445
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:51.970
- Send me an anniversary card. shall we?

446
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.113
- Follow me.

447
00:30:10.187 --> 00:30:12.680
- You're in a great deal
of danger. Mr. Valentine.

448
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.130
- It's common in my line of work.

449
00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.689
- I know we both took
the same career path.

450
00:30:16.689 --> 00:30:17.890
- MI5?

451
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.400
- We know why you're here.

452
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.880
We heard about your wife and daughter too.

453
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.643
my sincere condolences.

454
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.340
- I'm not leaving here
until Archer's dead.

455
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.143
- I had a feeling you were gonna say that.

456
00:30:32.679 --> 00:30:34.480
- I didn't catch your name.
- You can call me Marshall.

457
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.370
- You know Edward?
- Edward did a very poor job.

458
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.480
Your cover was blown
before you left London.

459
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.420
Edward's first-class. I guess
I'll have to take your word

460
00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.610
on that. Marshall.

461
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.300
- The very fact we're talking
should raise alarm bells.

462
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.060
- What exactly do you want?
- I want you to leave town.

463
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.930
that's what I want. I don't
care if you kill Samuel.

464
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:49.990
is that clear?
- I'm not leaving here

465
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:51.900
until Archer's dead. is
that clear enough for ya?

466
00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.390
- Get your business sorted this evening.

467
00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.490
We can't have dead bodies lying around.

468
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:57.090
- I'll even send a chap to
pick you up if you like.

469
00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.130
I'm very friendly that way.

470
00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.300
- I'll make my own way if
it's all the same to you.

471
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.793
- Well. that's fine. I wish
you the very best of British.

472
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.770
Oh. by the way. the station
serves a very fine coffee.

473
00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.020
I'd take advantage of
that fact if I were you

474
00:31:11.927 --> 00:31:15.010
(footsteps thudding)

475
00:31:46.479 --> 00:31:49.312
(person knocking)

476
00:31:55.534 --> 00:32:00.534
(door unlatching)
(door squeaking)

477
00:32:03.095 --> 00:32:08.095
- Is anyone here?
(door latching)

478
00:32:08.695 --> 00:32:09.645
I have your parcel.

479
00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.160
Is there someone there?

480
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.510
- You're five minutes late.

481
00:32:23.619 --> 00:32:26.780
- (stammers) I'm sorry.
I got stuck in traffic.

482
00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.477
- Put the parcel on the floor.

483
00:32:34.078 --> 00:32:36.290
(deliveryman thudding)
(deliveryman grunting)

484
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.670
- Well. that's wasn't very polite of ya.

485
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.510
- I'm about do a spot of decorating.

486
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:44.203
I was thinking dark red
would suit this room.

487
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.540
Don't you want to know
what's in the parcel?

488
00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:49.990
- Look. I'm just Here
to earn a few pounds.

489
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:52.133
I don't need to know
what's in that parcel.

490
00:32:54.285 --> 00:32:57.285
(package rummaging)

491
00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.173
- You like it?

492
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.463
- What's it for?

493
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:05.290
- It's for your blood.

494
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.819
- Excuse me?

495
00:33:06.819 --> 00:33:09.986
(deliveryman gagging)

496
00:33:12.322 --> 00:33:16.250
(speaking in a foreign language)

497
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.403
- Deep breath and count to 10. my lovely.

498
00:33:19.713 --> 00:33:24.713
(deliveryman grunting)
(deliveryman choking)

499
00:33:32.895 --> 00:33:35.562
(blood pouring)

500
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:49.240
- Fantastic. the finest in adrenochrome.

501
00:33:50.639 --> 00:33:54.010
(speaking in a foreign language)

502
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:57.090
Samuel will pay big money for this.

503
00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.080
- Forget about Samuel.

504
00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.453
Go to Martin direct. and
cut out the middleman.

505
00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.793
we'll make so much more.

506
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.563
- Good point.

507
00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.712
(speaking in a foreign language)

508
00:34:11.712 --> 00:34:14.462
(lips smooching)

509
00:34:21.262 --> 00:34:24.345
(footsteps thudding)

510
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.043
- Well?

511
00:34:28.672 --> 00:34:29.505
- I tried to warn him off.

512
00:34:29.505 --> 00:34:32.000
- And did he take your advice?

513
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.410
- Would you listen if I killed
a member of your family?

514
00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:36.510
- So we get rid of him.

515
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.840
- It's beginning to look that way?

516
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.240
- I think it's for the best.

517
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.360
- You still got my back?

518
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.333
- Always

519
00:34:49.028 --> 00:34:52.111
(footsteps thudding)

520
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.420
- Afternoon.
- Jesus.

521
00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.000
- Are you really the best they could find?

522
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.883
- Excuse me?

523
00:35:40.754 --> 00:35:42.250
(Bobby grunting)
- I'd stop moving

524
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.930
if I was you.
- I am late

525
00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:45.250
for an appointment.

526
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:46.900
- Who with?
- My doctor.

527
00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.130
- Well. you look fine to me.

528
00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:51.860
- Well. looks can be deceiving.
I have a heart condition.

529
00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.880
and if it goes checked
out (grunts). I could die.

530
00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:57.580
- I'm gonna ask you one more time.

531
00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.110
Who sent you to follow me?
- You're hurting me.

532
00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:04.140
- I don't care.
(Bobby squirming)

533
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.070
- Marshall sent me. Marshall.

534
00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.930
- Marshall. well that does surprise me.

535
00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:12.563
I held him in higher esteem.
(Bobby panting)

536
00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.100
- You're not going to
kill me now. are you?

537
00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.643
- You're not worth killing.

538
00:36:17.643 --> 00:36:19.630
I'll feel embarrassed taking your life.

539
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:20.463
- I agree.

540
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.130
Can I go now?

541
00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:25.280
- You're free to leave.

542
00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:30.410
- Is there anything else you
would like me to tell Marshall?

543
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.030
- Yeah. tell him to back off.

544
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.740
I'm not the sort of man that
likes to be put in a corner.

545
00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.483
- Sure. it was nice meeting you.

546
00:36:39.993 --> 00:36:42.870
and I certainly hope that you
find what you're looking for.

547
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:43.970
- Oh. I'm sure I will.

548
00:36:50.523 --> 00:36:53.440
(car horn honking)

549
00:36:56.523 --> 00:36:59.810
(Kit sighing)

550
00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:00.993
- The lady left.

551
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.250
- You should have been a detective.

552
00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.930
- [Owner] She gave me
this note to give to ya.

553
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:09.973
- How sweet of her.

554
00:37:11.025 --> 00:37:12.247
- [Owner] You want to read it or not?

555
00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.710
- Why not. I could do
with some entertainment.

556
00:37:18.678 --> 00:37:20.063
Is there something I can do for you.

557
00:37:20.914 --> 00:37:23.430
- Well. it's just. I wondered
if you wanted a bite to eat.

558
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:26.096
Kitchen's been open for over an hour.

559
00:37:26.096 --> 00:37:26.946
- I'm not hungry.

560
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.860
- We get a lot of our income from meals.

561
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.350
I think you can probably understand

562
00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:35.493
in a small town like this one.
we don't get too many guests.

563
00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:39.130
- I'll drop by the local food bank.

564
00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:40.980
Rustle up a couple of guests for you.

565
00:37:43.088 --> 00:37:44.710
- You've got an answer for
everything. haven't ya?

566
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:45.543
- I try.

567
00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:48.913
- Well. I'll be downstairs if you need me.

568
00:37:49.777 --> 00:37:52.833
the kitchen's open until
10 just so you know.

569
00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.033
- Appreciate it.

570
00:38:03.437 --> 00:38:08.437
(footsteps thudding)
(paper rummaging)

571
00:38:25.165 --> 00:38:27.915
(drill whirring)

572
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.290
- Any updates?

573
00:38:39.667 --> 00:38:40.834
- We have him.

574
00:38:46.304 --> 00:38:47.137
Oh gross..

575
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.810
He's in a safe house with Sasha.

576
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.307
and the rest of the gang
as we speak (sighs).

577
00:38:54.313 --> 00:38:55.146
- Good work.

578
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.610
- You look exhausted.

579
00:38:58.610 --> 00:38:59.930
Can I pour you a drink?

580
00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.230
- I won't say no.

581
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.523
- [Marshall] I need to
get him straight away.

582
00:39:09.735 --> 00:39:12.135
- I think Finchy would
want a play at him first?

583
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:14.840
- He needs to be killed ASAP.

584
00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:16.970
- What's the rush?

585
00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:19.620
- Sasha knows where he's staying.

586
00:39:21.057 --> 00:39:22.930
- You got no idea what
you're playing with.

587
00:39:25.368 --> 00:39:28.118
(Brian laughing)

588
00:39:30.623 --> 00:39:31.706
I don't care.

589
00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:34.413
I've done my job.

590
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.310
I found the guy. spring him in.

591
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:38.810
and now. I just want my money.

592
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:45.920
You said I could have
a little extra reward

593
00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.453
if I was a good boy. and did a good job.

594
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.160
- I think you've earned
a bit of play time.

595
00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.320
- What do you say. Michelle?

596
00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.410
- You're the boss. I just do as I'm told.

597
00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:02.243
- Good to know.

598
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.890
You've got 10 minutes.
- I need longer.

599
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:07.540
- 10 minutes. or we kick you out.

600
00:40:17.407 --> 00:40:19.907
(Kit panting)

601
00:40:22.464 --> 00:40:24.130
- Kit!

602
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:24.973
Kit. wake up!

603
00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:29.090
Wake up. kit!
(Kit grunting)

604
00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:30.013
Don't fight it.

605
00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.330
- Where am I?

606
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:35.483
- I'm trying to stop them.
I begged them to let you go.

607
00:40:35.483 --> 00:40:37.390
- Dave your tears. I'm not interested.

608
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:39.683
- Believe me.
- Where am I?

609
00:40:44.196 --> 00:40:46.270
- A house belonging to Samuel.

610
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.010
- Samuel Archer. so you work for him too.

611
00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.580
- I won't let them kill you.

612
00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.670
- Oh. I won't die that easily.

613
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.320
You'll find that out soon enough.

614
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:57.890
- I told them to leave you alone.

615
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:59.340
- You didn't try hard enough.

616
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.870
- Everybody wants you dead.

617
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.670
Archer runs everything in this town.

618
00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:08.810
- I had a feeling you knew Archer.

619
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.753
I came here to kill him.

620
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:14.843
- Why?

621
00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.740
- Oh. don't play dumb.

622
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.340
He's in possession of
something very valuable to me.

623
00:41:21.282 --> 00:41:22.115
and I think you know everything

624
00:41:22.115 --> 00:41:24.610
that's going on in this little town .

625
00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.760
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

626
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.983
- Your little gang took my only daughter.

627
00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.460
- I wasn't involved in that.

628
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:40.043
- And the other girls?

629
00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.840
- My younger sister.

630
00:41:49.850 --> 00:41:52.490
You have no idea how deep this goes.

631
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.650
- Oh. I understand very well.

632
00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:57.153
See it's my job to understand.

633
00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:00.313
They just stole from
the wrong guy this time.

634
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:03.383
Nothing to say?

635
00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:08.970
- You should've left this
town when you had the chance.

636
00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.293
- Where it's Archer?

637
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.373
Simone?

638
00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:21.073
- You don't know what you've walked into.

639
00:42:21.073 --> 00:42:22.323
- I asked you a question.

640
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:26.970
- This is a very small town.

641
00:42:29.199 --> 00:42:30.883
and there are many people involved.

642
00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:35.510
- I think I'm beginning
to get the picture.

643
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.170
- I don't think there's
anything I can do for you now.

644
00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:45.540
- Well. you could untie
my hands for a start.

645
00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.543
Just as I thought.

646
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:58.423
- If I get you out of here.
will you take me with you?

647
00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.220
Will you take me far away from this place?

648
00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:15.283
I think that I would go anywhere with you.

649
00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:20.520
- I'm not the man you think I am?

650
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.020
- Let me be the judge of that.

651
00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.590
- I think you're a good soul.

652
00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.473
- Simone.

653
00:43:28.636 --> 00:43:33.636
(door unlatching)
(footsteps thudding)

654
00:43:38.321 --> 00:43:40.988
(Bobby sighing)

655
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.683
- I'm sorry it had to end like this.

656
00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.713
- Edward?

657
00:43:49.701 --> 00:43:51.901
- You were getting far
too good at your job.

658
00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.910
You were beginning to cost us.

659
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:55.743
- Cost you?

660
00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.490
- I should have killed
you when I had the chance.

661
00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.813
- You caught me on a bad day.

662
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:06.110
- I'm not afraid of you.

663
00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:08.163
- Just wait.

664
00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:11.200
- We knew you'd follow your daughter.

665
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.070
- Archer bought you off?

666
00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.253
- Archer buys everybody off.

667
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.283
We were making a killing
'til you showed up.

668
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.333
Human trafficking is a
very lucrative business.

669
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.650
- You won't see your daughter again?

670
00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:40.172
- You're gonna pay for that.

671
00:44:40.172 --> 00:44:43.370
(Sasha laughing)

672
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:47.170
- I don't think you're in
any position to make threats.

673
00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:48.623
- Mr. Archer is not happy.

674
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:53.940
His men found Mark's body

675
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.197
You really do have to disappear.

676
00:45:00.343 --> 00:45:02.091
(punch thudding)
(Kit grunting)

677
00:45:02.091 --> 00:45:04.180
(Bobby laughing)

678
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.580
- Not such a tough guy
anymore. are ya (laughs)?

679
00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.973
- Leave. Mr. Valentine alone.
Bobby. there's a good chap.

680
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:15.690
- What did you do with my daughter?

681
00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.790
- You really have to ask.

682
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:20.320
She was stolen to order. Kit.

683
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.810
- And we got a good price for her too.

684
00:45:22.810 --> 00:45:24.913
- I am gonna rip your heart out.

685
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.470
- Oh. Anna was so young and beautiful.

686
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:29.610
- Satanic ritual?

687
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.220
- We're not the gang that
steals girls like her to order.

688
00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.710
but then you should know this.

689
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:39.150
It was your job to track such gangs.

690
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.173
- I was selected especially
to hunt people like you.

691
00:45:44.613 --> 00:45:48.770
- We know that. you're the
best. that's why you had to go.

692
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.323
Interpol.

693
00:45:53.988 --> 00:45:56.670
MI%. they all take a juicy cuts.

694
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.770
you were beginning to rock
a very lucrative blunt.

695
00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:01.380
- That's not what I meant.

696
00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:04.640
I was chosen for other
reasons. specific reasons.

697
00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.660
- And what might they be?

698
00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.580
- Gangs like yours.

699
00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.793
beginning to tread on our toes too.

700
00:46:13.163 --> 00:46:14.213
- I don't follow you.

701
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:19.830
- My people have a taste for fresh blood.

702
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.360
- Your people?

703
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.517
- You're not the only secret
society that operates with MI5.

704
00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.923
Only we've been around
for a very long time.

705
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.223
- No. you're just talking in riddles.

706
00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.773
- [Sasha] She was very pretty.

707
00:46:47.666 --> 00:46:48.499
(Kit sighing)

708
00:46:48.499 --> 00:46:51.583
- Sasha. be quiet. this
doesn't have to get ugly.

709
00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.253
This is only business.

710
00:46:58.460 --> 00:46:59.910
These thing's never personal.

711
00:47:04.024 --> 00:47:05.850
You were ruining our business.

712
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:08.120
we had to find some way to lure you here.

713
00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:12.220
plus we've got to make
cash from Anna's sale.

714
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.890
It was a win-win situation.

715
00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:15.757
- Where is she?

716
00:47:17.638 --> 00:47:21.130
- Oh. it really doesn't matter now.

717
00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:22.960
- Tell me where my daughter is.

718
00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.141
- I'm afraid you're far too late.

719
00:47:25.141 --> 00:47:26.820
your daughter is dead. Mr. Valentine.

720
00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.520
Let that be the end of the matter.

721
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.800
Now. I shall spare you
the gruesome details.

722
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.942
- Oh. I'm sure you know
what these groups get up to.

723
00:47:35.942 --> 00:47:38.775
(Edward chuckles)

724
00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.253
Anyway.

725
00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.113
I did my homework.

726
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.130
She's not even your real daughter. is she?

727
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.113
Can't you have children. Mr. Valentine.

728
00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.520
- By choice.

729
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.210
- Choice?
- Bad blood.

730
00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:58.043
- Oh.

731
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.223
- I am going to kill you all.

732
00:48:03.657 --> 00:48:05.007
- Well. so you keep saying.

733
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.270
Though I'm sure under
normal circumstances.

734
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:11.895
we'd all be in a great deal of trouble.

735
00:48:11.895 --> 00:48:14.478
(all laughing)

736
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:17.310
- I'll be trying to make your passing

737
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:18.970
as painless as possible.

738
00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.180
Believe me when I tell you.

739
00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:24.760
I take no pleasure in
killing a fellow agent.

740
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.463
especially one as good as you.

741
00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:34.487
- [Kit] You get your dirty hands off me.

742
00:48:34.487 --> 00:48:35.820
[Sasha Laughing]

743
00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.643
- This is going to hurt a lot.

744
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:47.380
I will do my best to cause
as much pain as possible.

745
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:50.460
- [Edward] Sasha. just
get on with it. will you?

746
00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.990
- Just having a little fun. my love.

747
00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:54.757
You always spoil my fun (laughs).

748
00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.483
- I am looking so forward
to watching you die.

749
00:49:01.246 --> 00:49:02.380
(laughs) I'm gonna get a lot.

750
00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.283
Oh. I'm gonna get a lot
of pleasure out of this.

751
00:49:07.341 --> 00:49:08.591
- I'm so sorry.

752
00:49:51.323 --> 00:49:53.990
(woman panting)

753
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:01.662
- Why?

754
00:50:04.575 --> 00:50:08.365
Why are they doing this (sobs)?

755
00:50:08.365 --> 00:50:12.532
(speaking in a foreign language)

756
00:50:22.203 --> 00:50:24.793
Why are you taking me away from my family?

757
00:50:26.359 --> 00:50:29.753
- I'm going to see the boss
now. I'll ask him for you.

758
00:50:31.101 --> 00:50:33.851
- (sobs) please.

759
00:50:35.168 --> 00:50:39.723
(speaking in a foreign language)

760
00:50:39.723 --> 00:50:44.640
(sobs) Please (whimpers).

761
00:50:50.285 --> 00:50:52.868
(sobs) Please.

762
00:50:55.288 --> 00:50:57.455
I have a daughter. please.

763
00:50:58.646 --> 00:51:03.146
Take me away from here please (sobs).

764
00:51:40.554 --> 00:51:45.137
No. please (sobs). no. please. please.

765
00:51:50.643 --> 00:51:54.226
Please. please. no (sobs).

766
00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:00.287
No. please (sobs).

767
00:52:01.186 --> 00:52:05.401
Please. don't. no. no (sobs).

768
00:52:05.401 --> 00:52:10.401
(bones crushing)
No (sobs).

769
00:52:21.215 --> 00:52:25.132
- It's rude to point (laughs).

770
00:52:36.279 --> 00:52:39.029
(lips smooching)

771
00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:47.133
Ciao bella (laughs).

772
00:52:48.444 --> 00:52:51.111
(woman sobbing)

773
00:52:52.679 --> 00:52:54.841
(Mario laughing)

774
00:52:54.841 --> 00:52:58.008
(car engine growling)

775
00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.553
- I hope to serve you well this evening.

776
00:53:23.102 --> 00:53:28.102
(chalice thudding)
(Samuel sighing)

777
00:53:28.267 --> 00:53:31.100
(Samuel slurping)

778
00:53:37.039 --> 00:53:40.122
(footsteps thudding)

779
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.200
- The other girl fetched a good price.

780
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.473
Clients were very happy.

781
00:53:54.705 --> 00:53:57.455
(Samuel sighing)

782
00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.630
- This will make us wealthy too one day.

783
00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:04.933
- She'll have to change her
attitude before that can happen.

784
00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.827
- She'll earn us some men.

785
00:54:09.827 --> 00:54:11.473
- You'll have a long wait.

786
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:15.950
- She's spirited. we have
clients who like that.

787
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:17.223
- Go to hell.

788
00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:20.060
- That's my goal.

789
00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:22.493
- [Margaret] What shall we do with her?

790
00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:25.210
- She'll come with me.

791
00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:26.883
Finish your shift for the evening.

792
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.653
- Very well.

793
00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.320
- Do you have any work left to complete?

794
00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.220
- Bits and pieces.

795
00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:41.083
- I'll leave the keys with
you if that's the case.

796
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.193
- Fine. hope you sleep well tonight?

797
00:54:47.770 --> 00:54:48.720
- I'm sure I will.

798
00:54:50.845 --> 00:54:53.690
(Samuel panting)
(Samuel grunting)

799
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.250
- Are you gonna give me any trouble?

800
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:57.360
- It's not me you have to worry about.

801
00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.021
- What does that mean?

802
00:54:59.021 --> 00:55:00.271
- You'll see soon enough.

803
00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:03.410
I'll see you tomorrow. Margaret.

804
00:55:05.116 --> 00:55:08.199
(footsteps thudding)

805
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:16.810
- I'm so sorry it had to end this way.

806
00:55:17.823 --> 00:55:22.823
(footsteps thudding)
(Kit sighing)

807
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.623
- What is it like knowing
that you're about to die?

808
00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:30.370
- I wouldn't be so sure.

809
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.370
- I admire your courage.

810
00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:35.883
I will say that much for you.

811
00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.600
Hey. do you mind?

812
00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.960
I was just talking to this lovely man.

813
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.563
- Keep your distance. Bitch.

814
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:48.620
- That's no way to talk to a close friend.

815
00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:50.843
I'm sure he wasn't
raised to talk that way.

816
00:55:51.729 --> 00:55:52.562
You should be ashamed.

817
00:55:52.562 --> 00:55:53.860
- I said keep your distance.

818
00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:55.550
- And if I don't?

819
00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:57.498
- Then I'll scratch your eyes out.

820
00:55:57.498 --> 00:55:59.171
(Sasha laughing)

821
00:55:59.171 --> 00:56:00.873
- Well.

822
00:56:02.336 --> 00:56:04.850
I will leave you with your man. Simone.

823
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:07.203
I advise you two enjoy every last second.

824
00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:10.660
He won't be around for much longer.

825
00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:13.690
- One more word. Sasha. one more.

826
00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:15.493
and I swear to God. I will kill you.

827
00:56:22.372 --> 00:56:24.910
- That thing I needed to tell you.

828
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:26.360
- I'm not interested. Simone.

829
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:30.225
- It's about your
daughter. you need to know.

830
00:56:30.225 --> 00:56:31.642
- What about her?

831
00:56:37.037 --> 00:56:38.843
- Is she hurt. Simone?

832
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.943
- They're lying to you. she's still alive.

833
00:56:45.383 --> 00:56:46.800
(Kit sighing)

834
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.400
- She's still alive?

835
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.233
- Very much so.

836
00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:55.323
Shit.

837
00:56:59.297 --> 00:57:01.083
Is she hurt. Simone?

838
00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:03.960
- They will harm her. I know that much.

839
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:07.900
- Where is she?

840
00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.530
- What difference does it make it?

841
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:11.430
There's nothing you can do to save her.

842
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:13.520
- Tell me where they're
keeping my daughter.

843
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.353
- Hey.

844
00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.193
move.

845
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:21.650
You know Mr. Valentine.

846
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:25.493
I sure hope it takes a
long time for you to die.

847
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.533
- It's not my time to die.

848
00:57:31.873 --> 00:57:32.973
- Oh. really (laughs)?

849
00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:36.640
What makes you so sure?

850
00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.903
- Don't torment him.
- Quiet.

851
00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.310
I asked you a question.

852
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:48.247
- You. you should be very afraid (pants)!

853
00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:51.500
(Bobby laughing)

854
00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.400
- Afraid (laughs)?

855
00:57:53.883 --> 00:57:55.763
Why. why should I be afraid?

856
00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:58.810
(Kit panting)

857
00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:00.977
- Never cross a vampire.

858
00:58:02.731 --> 00:58:05.648
- (laughs) A what?

859
00:58:07.595 --> 00:58:10.234
What is happening in your face?

860
00:58:10.234 --> 00:58:15.234
(Kit grunting)
(Kit growling)

861
00:58:17.739 --> 00:58:20.186
What's happening to his face!

862
00:58:20.186 --> 00:58:25.186
Oh God!
(footsteps thudding)

863
00:58:30.304 --> 00:58:35.304
(Edward thudding)
(Edward grunting)

864
00:58:38.298 --> 00:58:40.798
(Kit hissing)

865
00:58:45.512 --> 00:58:48.345
(knife whooshing)

866
00:58:58.144 --> 00:59:03.144
(knife thudding)
(Edward grunting)

867
00:59:13.456 --> 00:59:18.456
(footsteps thudding)
(door clanking)

868
00:59:32.823 --> 00:59:36.156
- (pants) What are you?

869
00:59:37.436 --> 00:59:40.353
(plastic rustling)

870
00:59:43.632 --> 00:59:44.590
- You've done this before?

871
00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:47.330
- Once or twice each century.

872
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:50.256
I'm very picky.
(Brian chuckling)

873
00:59:50.256 --> 00:59:51.570
- Each century?

874
00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:55.003
- Be quiet. and just enjoy.

875
00:59:57.052 --> 00:59:58.533
- (laughs) This is gonna be fun.

876
00:59:59.490 --> 01:00:00.573
- It will be.

877
01:00:03.139 --> 01:00:04.547
(Michelle hissing)

878
01:00:04.547 --> 01:00:06.630
- [Brian] What the hell
is going on (pants).

879
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:10.506
- Are you having a fun time. my sweet

880
01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:12.506
- What the hell are you?

881
01:00:15.841 --> 01:00:20.674
(screams) Oh god (pits)!

882
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.620
- I like to nibble a bit (laughs).

883
01:00:26.093 --> 01:00:29.010
(glass shattering)

884
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.380
- This is intolerable.

885
01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:41.603
Simply intolerable.

886
01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.743
Is this some kind of joke.

887
01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:50.890
If you're playing silly buggers.

888
01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:55.043
then you're messing with
the wrong woman. Jesus.

889
01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:59.370
- You've been a close
friend of Samuel Archer

890
01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:00.700
for many years now. Margaret.

891
01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:03.760
you really should learn
to keep better company.

892
01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.327
- What do you want?

893
01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:06.859
- I want to know where Samuel is.

894
01:01:06.859 --> 01:01:07.930
- And then?

895
01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:08.847
- And then?

896
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:13.300
You took My daughter from me.

897
01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.800
- Daughter?
- Anna. her name is Anna.

898
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.003
You took her from me.

899
01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.410
and then you killed her mother.

900
01:01:21.626 --> 01:01:25.457
- I don't know what you mean.

901
01:01:25.457 --> 01:01:27.400
- You really need to leave.
it's getting late (whimpers).

902
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.673
I need to lock up.

903
01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.610
- You've been running a
human trafficking ring

904
01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:32.763
for decades now.

905
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:36.400
Supplying young girls to wealthy clients.

906
01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.443
clients who dabble in the black arts.

907
01:01:41.483 --> 01:01:43.150
- You need to leave.

908
01:01:44.045 --> 01:01:45.695
You need to leave now (whimpers).

909
01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:48.110
You see. I know all about
your little operation.

910
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:50.283
It's my job to disrupt gangs like yours.

911
01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.460
- Do you want me to call the police?

912
01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:58.720
- The irony is you were
supplying practicing Satanists.

913
01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.433
Only your men stole from
the real undead this time.

914
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:05.740
Couldn't help find that amusing.

915
01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:07.490
- You stay away from me (gasps).

916
01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:09.980
- Where is she?

917
01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:12.637
- I told you I don't know.

918
01:02:12.637 --> 01:02:14.565
- Where is my daughter?

919
01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:17.138
Where is Samuel Archer?

920
01:02:17.138 --> 01:02:19.864
(Margaret gagging)

921
01:02:19.864 --> 01:02:20.714
Oh that's better.

922
01:02:21.878 --> 01:02:23.778
Now. that wasn't so difficult. was it?

923
01:02:27.032 --> 01:02:29.014
(Margaret grunting)
(bone crunching)

924
01:02:29.014 --> 01:02:33.488
You really should have run
when you had the chance.

925
01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:38.488
(Kit grunting)
(Kit panting)

926
01:02:53.145 --> 01:02:55.812
(cash whirring)

927
01:02:59.658 --> 01:03:00.825
- He's coming?

928
01:03:26.521 --> 01:03:31.521
- Marshall Mabus. (speaking
in a foreign language).

929
01:03:32.027 --> 01:03:33.493
you look a bit tired.

930
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:37.250
- I've been out in the sun too long.

931
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:43.633
- Care for the sun. lapis lazuli.

932
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.673
How is the lovely Michelle?

933
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.830
- She's having a bite to eat.

934
01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.593
- I'll be joining her later.

935
01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:58.913
- And Anne.

936
01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:01.123
- Oh. she's with Samuel.

937
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:07.163
- I'm so glad you're happy with my work.

938
01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.587
- Where's my adrenochrome.

939
01:04:12.915 --> 01:04:15.998
(footsteps thudding)

940
01:04:19.234 --> 01:04:23.317
(speaking in a foreign language)

941
01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:31.233
- Like nectar to the gods.

942
01:04:52.535 --> 01:04:54.118
- Where's my money?

943
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:57.403
- I need my fix on. baby.

944
01:04:58.908 --> 01:04:59.991
- Be patient.

945
01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:12.320
(speaking in a foreign language) .

946
01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:20.300
- He's not making any sense.

947
01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.300
- Too many murders can do that to a man.

948
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:27.017
and he was getting far too expensive.

949
01:05:28.084 --> 01:05:31.001
(gunshots booming)

950
01:05:34.232 --> 01:05:36.899
(Mario panting)

951
01:05:44.793 --> 01:05:47.543
(Mario grunting)

952
01:06:01.588 --> 01:06:05.671
(speaking in a foreign language)

953
01:06:26.613 --> 01:06:30.780
(speaking in a foreign language)

954
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:40.480
Well. that's perfect. are we. ladies?

955
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:42.243
- Quite.

956
01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:51.810
(cellphone dinging)

957
01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.033
- Yes.

958
01:07:01.033 --> 01:07:02.420
- [Mike] Where in the hell are you?

959
01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.510
- Why are you shouting. Mike?

960
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:06.104
I couldn't hear you.
- I was worried about you.

961
01:07:06.104 --> 01:07:07.620
- There's no need to lose your temper.

962
01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:10.130
- Are you on your way home.
- Yes. I'm on my way home.

963
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.760
- It's late.
- I was studying late.

964
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.963
Why are you behaving like this?

965
01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:17.450
You need to stop behaving like this.

966
01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:18.560
I have a test in a few weeks.

967
01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.160
I'm already under a lot of stress.

968
01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.630
- [Mike] You'll be home soon?

969
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:22.883
- Yes. I'll be home soon.

970
01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.930
- [Mike] You still there?

971
01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:27.920
Hello?
- (stammers) I need to go now.

972
01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920
- [Mike] Mia. Mia?

973
01:07:38.771 --> 01:07:41.688
(object squishing)

974
01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.300
(Mia panting)

975
01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.010
- Hey.

976
01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:55.090
slow down.

977
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:57.972
- Please. just help me.
- Help you?

978
01:07:57.972 --> 01:07:59.677
- we have to run.
- Run where (laughs)?

979
01:07:59.677 --> 01:08:00.640
Run from what?

980
01:08:02.784 --> 01:08:06.340
(object clanking)

981
01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.090
What's going on?

982
01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:09.523
Is someone chasing you?

983
01:08:10.533 --> 01:08:12.253
- (stammers) don't speak.

984
01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.400
- You don't have to be afraid. you know?

985
01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:19.803
I'm ex-military I can
handle a couple of drunks.

986
01:08:21.690 --> 01:08:22.540
What's your name?

987
01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:24.690
You're very pretty.

988
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:27.980
Get your filthy hands off me.

989
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:30.480
- Don't you think I
deserve a little something

990
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.313
for helping you?

991
01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:35.525
- Screw you (pants).

992
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.293
- I was only being friendly.

993
01:08:42.055 --> 01:08:45.676
(car engine growling)

994
01:08:45.676 --> 01:08:48.593
(object squirming)

995
01:08:56.706 --> 01:08:58.680
(Kit hissing)

996
01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.780
Don't you come any closer. no. I tell you?

997
01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:04.930
I'll call the police.
(Kit laughing)

998
01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:05.763
Stay back.

999
01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:08.647
I won't tell you again.

1000
01:09:35.857 --> 01:09:38.524
- You can't ignore me all night.

1001
01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:44.373
Come to me.

1002
01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:55.113
Don't make me fetch you.

1003
01:09:58.493 --> 01:09:59.683
Are you hungry.

1004
01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:03.603
- No.

1005
01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:05.993
- Water?

1006
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:08.693
- [Anna] I'm not thirsty.

1007
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:11.463
- Very well.

1008
01:10:12.766 --> 01:10:14.649
(object clanking)

1009
01:10:14.649 --> 01:10:15.482
- He's here.

1010
01:10:16.329 --> 01:10:17.829
- Who?
- My father.

1011
01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:21.120
- Nobody knows where
you are except for me.

1012
01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.477
- He'll find you.

1013
01:10:24.549 --> 01:10:26.700
That's a lot of noise for
such a small town. isn't it?

1014
01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.612
- Be quiet.
- Are you frightened?

1015
01:10:29.612 --> 01:10:31.510
(slap thudding)

1016
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:34.060
- You're the only one who
needs to understand fear.

1017
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:37.400
I've waited a long time
for someone like you.

1018
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.370
- She should enjoy every minute.

1019
01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:41.050
you don't have much time left.

1020
01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:44.593
- Oh. I'm gonna enjoy you.
don't you worry about that.

1021
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:48.260
- Look. you could still let me go.

1022
01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.293
I'll even put in a good word for you.

1023
01:10:51.808 --> 01:10:53.000
- (laughs)I answer to no man.

1024
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.020
- My father is more than just a man.

1025
01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:58.920
- Do you know how many men
I've killed with my bare hands?

1026
01:10:59.890 --> 01:11:01.400
- That doesn't frighten me.

1027
01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.393
I could break your neck
right now. do you understand?

1028
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:10.043
- But you won't. you'd
miss me far too much?

1029
01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:12.300
- What are you?

1030
01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.350
- Something you'll never able to control?

1031
01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.073
- I want you

1032
01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:18.223
to want me.

1033
01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:19.893
that's all.

1034
01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.543
- I will. just not the way you think.

1035
01:11:25.774 --> 01:11:27.320
(person knocking)
- Oh.

1036
01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.510
it looks like you could have guests.

1037
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:32.543
Perhaps my father has
arrived sooner than expected.

1038
01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:35.620
- Be quiet.
- He'll be very pleased

1039
01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:38.139
to meet you. I can tell you that much.

1040
01:11:38.139 --> 01:11:38.972
(person knocking)

1041
01:11:38.972 --> 01:11:40.910
- I'm gonna go check outside.

1042
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:42.670
- I'd stay here if I were you.

1043
01:11:42.670 --> 01:11:44.700
it's better to die in
your bed than out there

1044
01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:45.983
in the dark and cold.

1045
01:11:45.983 --> 01:11:47.485
(slap thudding)

1046
01:11:47.485 --> 01:11:49.337
- One more word out of you.

1047
01:11:49.337 --> 01:11:51.210
I'm gonna put a bullet between
those pretty eyes of yours.

1048
01:11:51.210 --> 01:11:52.842
do you understand?

1049
01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:54.630
- It wouldn't have the
effect you were looking for.

1050
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:55.580
- What do you mean?

1051
01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:00.050
- Just been toying with you.

1052
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.480
- Toy?
(person knocking)

1053
01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.800
- Go. go and see what's outside.

1054
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.650
I'll still be here when you get back.

1055
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:12.430
- I wish you'd stop
speaking in those riddles..

1056
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:14.580
- I have to keep you
on your toes. don't I?

1057
01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:19.060
- You just wait here until I get back.

1058
01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:20.830
- Of course. anything you say

1059
01:12:26.599 --> 01:12:28.180
(Anna sighing)

1060
01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.380
I know you're out there.

1061
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:31.980
We'll be together again soon.

1062
01:12:35.283 --> 01:12:38.033
(body squishing)

1063
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.920
- Hands-off. bitch. that piece is mine.

1064
01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.877
- Yours. I did all the dirty work.

1065
01:12:50.877 --> 01:12:52.570
- Dirty. you can say that again.

1066
01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:54.991
- What's your mouth.
- Watch yours.

1067
01:12:54.991 --> 01:12:57.991
(Marshall grunting)

1068
01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:05.275
(body squishing)
(cellphone dinging)

1069
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:09.774
- Samuel?

1070
01:13:09.774 --> 01:13:10.607
- [Samuel] Kid escaped.

1071
01:13:10.607 --> 01:13:13.126
I hear all kind of crazy tales.

1072
01:13:13.126 --> 01:13:15.570
This is your fault. boss. you sent Mario.

1073
01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:17.330
and it was your pick.

1074
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:18.930
Who the hell is this kid anyway?

1075
01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.413
- Stop worrying. it'll be sorted.

1076
01:13:48.927 --> 01:13:50.060
- Brought you all here.
'cause I want to start hearing

1077
01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:50.933
some answers.

1078
01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:54.323
All this talk of monsters and shit.

1079
01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.253
I found Margaret laying down on the floor!

1080
01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.260
It took me an hour to clean up her body.

1081
01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.500
I wanna start hearing the truth.

1082
01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.033
You start.

1083
01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.000
- He was huge.

1084
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.163
- Don't exaggerate.

1085
01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:17.970
- He was like. I don't
know. over eight feet tall.

1086
01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:19.430
- I saw everything.

1087
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:20.343
Stop lying.

1088
01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.570
- I'm not. look (grunts).

1089
01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:28.980
- Imbecile. you know I made a
big mistake hiring this idiot.

1090
01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:31.103
- I couldn't have put it better myself.

1091
01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:34.100
- Did you follow 'em?

1092
01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:38.397
- No. we were too scared (whimpers).

1093
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:40.133
- Scared?

1094
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:43.883
I pay you both not to be afraid.

1095
01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:46.483
- You didn't see him.

1096
01:14:47.762 --> 01:14:50.337
You wouldn't understand.

1097
01:14:50.337 --> 01:14:51.893
- Are you saying Bobby's
telling the truth?

1098
01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:54.323
- Partly.

1099
01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.153
- I didn't deserve that boss.

1100
01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:01.790
- Would you like another one?

1101
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:11.550
- He wasn't human.
(Samuel laughing)

1102
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:12.903
- I'm telling the truth.

1103
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:15.203
- She is.

1104
01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:18.410
- You're trying to cover for his tracks.

1105
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:19.417
- You let him escape.
- No.

1106
01:15:19.417 --> 01:15:21.660
- Do you think I'm stupid.

1107
01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:22.710
- You didn't see him.

1108
01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.603
If you saw him. you'd believe.

1109
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.453
He changed right before eyes.

1110
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.780
- Do you believe me now?

1111
01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:41.210
- Be quiet.
- You can still get away

1112
01:15:41.210 --> 01:15:42.103
if you leave now.

1113
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.943
- sit down.

1114
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:49.360
No one's leaving.

1115
01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.930
We stay here 'til first light.
(Anna laughing)

1116
01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:53.930
- You won't be alive by tomorrow morning

1117
01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:57.196
(objects clanking)
- What was that?

1118
01:15:57.196 --> 01:15:58.660
- You had your chance.

1119
01:15:58.660 --> 01:16:01.463
- We need to Leave.
- Stay where you are.

1120
01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:04.217
One more footstep. and
I'll kill you both myself.

1121
01:16:04.217 --> 01:16:06.783
- Bullets will have no
effect on my father.

1122
01:16:10.005 --> 01:16:13.200
- You don't understand.
we need to leave now.

1123
01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.823
- The idiot's right for once.

1124
01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:19.663
- [Bobby] Can you see anything?

1125
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:25.120
- He won't reveal himself to you.

1126
01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:27.050
you'll only see him when it's too late.

1127
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:28.320
- Shut up.

1128
01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.820
- [Sasha] Kill the bitch

1129
01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:32.083
- [Bobby] If you don't kill her. I will.

1130
01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.310
- Get the car keys from my desk. Bobby.

1131
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:36.143
- Yes. boss.

1132
01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:39.460
- Where shall we go?

1133
01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:42.202
- I have safe houses scattered
around. we'll be safe there.

1134
01:16:42.202 --> 01:16:43.560
- (laughs) That's what you think.

1135
01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.453
- What about her?

1136
01:16:46.399 --> 01:16:48.450
There is plenty like this one.

1137
01:16:48.450 --> 01:16:51.153
We'll get you a new toy. give me the gun.

1138
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:55.170
Ready when you are. boss.
- Can I please just come.

1139
01:16:55.170 --> 01:16:56.810
and watch you all die?

1140
01:16:56.810 --> 01:17:00.163
- Kill her!
(electricity whooshing)

1141
01:17:01.038 --> 01:17:03.020
Are you kidding me. right?

1142
01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:05.537
- Stand close.
- Get off me.

1143
01:17:05.537 --> 01:17:07.420
(Samuel whimpering)

1144
01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.253
- Sasha?

1145
01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.570
Bobby (whimpers)?

1146
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:13.723
Where's everyone.

1147
01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:17.063
- He's here.

1148
01:17:19.023 --> 01:17:21.690
(body thudding)

1149
01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.113
- Anna?
- Father.

1150
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:29.703
- What are you?

1151
01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:33.507
- I am a friend of the night.

1152
01:17:34.894 --> 01:17:39.894
(Samuel grunting)
(Samuel gagging)

1153
01:17:41.043 --> 01:17:42.300
(gunshot booming)

1154
01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:43.633
- Father?
- Anna!

1155
01:17:45.334 --> 01:17:47.826
- Father (pants)?

1156
01:17:47.826 --> 01:17:48.659
Father?

1157
01:17:52.653 --> 01:17:55.290
- Anna please.
- I'm going to die.

1158
01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:57.490
- It's not your time
yet. it's the only way.

1159
01:17:59.431 --> 01:18:00.848
- Just let me go.

1160
01:18:09.984 --> 01:18:12.817
(teeth crunching)

1161
01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:22.111
(gun clanking)

1162
01:18:27.116 --> 01:18:30.391
- I'm gonna find you. Kit.

1163
01:18:30.391 --> 01:18:31.591
I'm gonna find you both.

1164
01:18:37.906 --> 01:18:40.720
(gun cocking)

1165
01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.860
- You know. it was the only way.

1166
01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:43.693
- I know.

1167
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:47.760
- Well. now you're stuck
with me for eternity.

1168
01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.343
- Sounds quite good to me. Dad.

1169
01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.913
- Are you hungry?

1170
01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.340
- I'm gonna be the one
who treats you this time.

1171
01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.620
- Very well.
- We must be quick though.

1172
01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:59.570
we can't miss our train back to London.

1173
01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:00.403
- After you.

1174
01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.980
- We have rich pickings
to choose from here.

1175
01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:06.640
- Well. just make sure it's
a good vintage this time.

1176
01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.286
- I shall. and then?

1177
01:19:08.286 --> 01:19:11.378
- And then. we go back to our nest.
