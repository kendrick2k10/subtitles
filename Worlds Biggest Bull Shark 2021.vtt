00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:19.158
where I first learned to
dive as a kid in the '90s and

165
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:22.061
I saw my first
bull shark on that trip.

166
00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:25.565
and that gave me my passion
for sharks and the ocean.

167
00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:28.601
So it’s incredible to be back
here using the military skills

168
00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:32.672
that I’ve developed
over my career to
support shark science

169
00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:35.608
and to go out and find the
world’s biggest bull shark.

JAMES (off-screen):
When you get more than
five or six bull sharks.

189
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:14.240
they get more of
a pack mentality.

190
00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:17.143
They are an incredible
predator that understands

191
00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:19.311
where our sensory systems are.

192
00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:23.949

NEIL: That was epic!
JAMES: Loads of bull sharks.

249
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.259
NEIL: Some nice sized bulls;
not as big as Big Bull.

250
00:14:53.325 --> 00:14:56.095
but I feel really good about
this as a good starting point

251
00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:58.030
to take the search
to the next level.

252
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.399

<i>the sharks here</i>
<i>may be her offspring.</i>

258
00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:24.623
<i>There’s one way to find out.</i>

259
00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:30.930
<i>When Neil</i>
<i>encountered Big Bull.</i>

260
00:15:31.397 --> 00:15:34.099
<i>he collected tissue</i>
<i>for DNA analysis.</i>

261
00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:36.769
NEIL: Okay got it.
Fresh blood sample here.

262
00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:39.338
<i>NARRATOR: Now. they can use</i>
<i>it to find her offspring.</i>

263
00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:44.276
<i>She may be the matriarch of</i>
<i>a giant family that could</i>

264
00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:46.679
<i>include other</i>
<i>super-sized bulls.</i>

265
00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:52.785
<i>She could have more</i>
<i>than 100 children and</i>
<i>countless grandchildren.</i>

266
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.323
<i>a hopeful sign for</i>
<i>a declining species.</i>

267
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.530
JAMES: What's exciting to me
is that that bull shark was

268
00:16:04.596 --> 00:16:07.766
clearly an amazing
genetic specimen.

269
00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:11.503
So now can we find out whether
she's bred successfully and

270
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.274
passed those genes on to other
bull sharks that are in the

271
00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:17.109
coastal areas around Florida?

272
00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.746
NEIL: The sample from
Big Bull was taken as

273
00:16:20.846 --> 00:16:23.015
part of larger
population study.

274
00:16:23.082 --> 00:16:25.784
Now. I’ve sent that sample off
to various collaborators to

275
00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:27.453
see what else we can learn.

276
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.358
<i>NARRATOR: Enter</i>
<i>shark biologist.</i>
<i>Dr. Toby Daly-Engle.</i>

NEIL: Daly-Engle dangerous.

278
00:16:34.393 --> 00:16:35.327
TOBY: How's it going?

279
00:16:35.394 --> 00:16:37.663
<i>NARRATOR: DNA could tell</i>
<i>Toby if other large sharks in</i>

280

<i>Florida are Big Bull’s babies.</i>

281
00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:45.804
TOBY: The genetics that we're
doing is basically the same

282
00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:49.808
exact process that would
happen if you swabbed your

283
00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:53.512
cheek and sent it into
an ancestry database.

284
00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:57.182
<i>NARRATOR: As a first step.</i>
<i>Neil has looked more closely</i>

285
00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:59.985
<i>at Big Bull’s original</i>
<i>blood sample for clues.</i>

286
00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:03.889
JAMES: From the blood samples
you took when you caught

287
00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.158
Big Bull were you able to
tell if she was pregnant?

288
00:17:06.225 --> 00:17:10.195
NEIL: The bad news is
that she was not pregnant.
based on the blood work.

289
00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:14.099
the good news is that she
had recently given birth.

290
00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.401
JAMES: Awesome.
TOBY: Wow.

291
00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:18.604
JAMES: So her offspring
are potentially off
the coast right now.

292
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.073
TOBY: So she might
have grandchildren and

293
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.075
maybe even
great-grandchildren.

294
00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:26.145
We can do DNA fingerprinting
that will give us a

295
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:29.581
measurement of how closely
any two sharks are related.

296

and the entire species.

302
00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:58.110

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:35.953
<i>They’re assertive and</i>
<i>outnumber the bulls.</i>

646
00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.055
<i>But nowhere near as</i>
<i>deadly and not what</i>

647
00:37:38.122 --> 00:37:39.690
<i>Neil and James are after.</i>

648
00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:43.294
<i>Then.</i>

649
00:37:44.528 --> 00:37:45.363
<i>Bulls.</i>

650
00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:48.733
<i>Two big ones.</i>

651
00:37:51.502 --> 00:37:53.204
<i>One comes in fast.</i>

652
00:37:58.476 --> 00:38:00.311
<i>Neil has his</i>
<i>probe in position.</i>

653
00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.215
<i>but he must wait</i>
<i>for the right moment.</i>

654
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:11.555
<i>Bull’s eye!</i>

655
00:38:12.023 --> 00:38:13.924
<i>JAMES (over radio): Nice shot!</i>

656
00:38:13.991 --> 00:38:15.226
<i>NARRATOR: One down.</i>

657
00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:18.062
<i>But they also want a sample</i>
<i>from the second larger shark.</i>

658
00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:26.937
<i>It could even be</i>
<i>the queen of bull</i>
<i>sharks herself. Big Bull.</i>

659
00:38:31.075 --> 00:38:33.144
<i>NARRATOR: But a gang of</i>
<i>lemon sharks moves in.</i>

660
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.482
<i>And one of them</i>
<i>locks in on James.</i>

661
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:52.830
<i>NARRATOR: Neil and James want</i>
<i>a biopsy from a shark down</i>

662
00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:55.366
<i>below that may be Big Bull.</i>

663
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.370
<i>possibly the largest</i>
<i>bull shark in the ocean.</i>

664
00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:04.842
<i>But a swarm of aggressive</i>
<i>lemon sharks pins them down.</i>

665
00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.216
<i>One of them sees</i>
<i>James as a target.</i>

666
00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:23.928
<i>James deflects an attack.</i>

667
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.798
<i>And covers their retreat.</i>

668
00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:38.409
JAMES: I think
that’s enough for now.

669
00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:41.779
The lemons are
getting way too intense.

670
00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:43.948
I think someone’s going
to get bit at some point.

671
00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:45.483
My camera certainly did.

672
00:39:57.094 --> 00:39:59.296
NEIL: We’re super lucky
that we got one biopsy because

673
00:39:59.363 --> 00:40:02.533
those bulls were staying deep
and any time they came kind of

674
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.969
close the lemons would charge.

675
00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:10.174
<i>NARRATOR: It’s</i>
<i>just too dangerous.</i>

676
00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.176
<i>They decide to call it.</i>

677
00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:16.647
<i>But Toby has been</i>
<i>working on the DNA</i>
<i>they already collected.</i>

678
00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:18.749
<i>And she has results.</i>

679
00:40:20.217 --> 00:40:23.020
<i>Was Big Bull just</i>
<i>a freakish anomaly?</i>

680
00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:27.158
<i>Or has she given rise to a new</i>
<i>generation of giants up and</i>

681
00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:28.993
<i>down the Florida coast?</i>

682
00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.200
TOBY: We pretty
much expected to
get nothing. right.

683
00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:39.603
I mean finding two
related sharks should be

684
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.405
like a needle in a haystack.

685
00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:43.674
NEIL: Like a
huge ocean haystack.

686
00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:48.913
TOBY: Huge haystack. and not
only did we find offspring

687
00:40:48.979 --> 00:40:52.016
we found three
offspring of Big Bull.

688
00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:53.384
NEIL: Are you kidding me?

689
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:54.785
JAMES: That’s and amazing
story. that’s good news.

690
00:40:54.852 --> 00:40:55.686
TOBY: Yeah.

691
00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:59.290
JAMES: So her offspring
are potentially off
the coast somewhere now.

692
00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:02.626
TOBY: Not potentially.
they’re definitely there.

693
00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:08.098
<i>NARRATOR: The big question</i>
<i>is where were they found?</i>

694
00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:11.202
<i>Is Big Bull having</i>
<i>pups in just one area.</i>

695
00:41:11.268 --> 00:41:14.104
<i>or spreading her</i>
<i>DNA all over Florida?</i>

696
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.641
NEIL: Where were
these offspring?

697
00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:19.210
TOBY: Well a couple
of different places.

698
00:41:19.276 --> 00:41:21.645
so we actually got
one at the shipwreck.

699
00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:24.682
NEIL: No kidding
that’s deep water.

700
00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:26.283
I mean those were
some big sharks.

701
00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:28.652
TOBY: Yeah. those
were not baby sharks.

702
00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.754
<i>NARRATOR: The sharks they</i>
<i>sampled at the wreck were</i>

703
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:32.623
<i>around ten years old.</i>

704
00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:35.392
<i>They could even be from</i>
<i>the litter Big Bull had</i>

705
00:41:35.459 --> 00:41:39.230
<i>just before her</i>
<i>original capture in 2012.</i>

706
00:41:41.432 --> 00:41:45.903
TOBY: The second sample
came from Indian River Lagoon.

707
00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:49.006
NEIL: From one of the
small sharks that we sampled?

708
00:41:49.073 --> 00:41:51.041
That’s insane.

709
00:41:51.108 --> 00:41:51.942
TOBY: I know.

710
00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:55.079
I ran this data about
100 times because I. I thought

711
00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:56.480
I had to be wrong.

712
00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:00.184
<i>NARRATOR: This is the pup.</i>

713
00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:02.786
WOMAN: Aw. he has
a tiny little mouth.

714
00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:04.288
<i>NARRATOR: Just a year old.</i>

715
00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:06.056
NEIL: It’s an
incredible specimen.

716
00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:08.492
<i>NARRATOR: And from</i>
<i>Big Bull herself.</i>

717
00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:14.932
<i>which means it’s likely</i>
<i>Big Bull is still out there.</i>

718
00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:16.967
NEIL: This blows my mind.

719
00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:22.172
I never expected to
be able to actually
identify offspring of Big Bull

720
00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:26.076
suggesting that
she’s still not only
alive but reproducing.

721
00:42:26.143 --> 00:42:27.444
Where else?

722
00:42:27.711 --> 00:42:31.715
TOBY: Well the third offspring
was one of the big sharks that

723
00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:33.584
was following the mullet run.

724
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:34.652
NEIL: That’s amazing.

725
00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.256
<i>NARRATOR: Four locations</i>
<i>off the Florida coast.</i>

726
00:42:39.323 --> 00:42:41.325
<i>from Marathon where</i>
<i>she was captured.</i>

727
00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:44.595
<i>to the wreck site. to</i>
<i>the mullet run area.</i>

728
00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:47.398
<i>and all the way up to</i>
<i>the Indian River Lagoon.</i>

729
00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:50.834
<i>at least a 200-mile range.</i>

730
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:53.938
TOBY: The fact that we are
finding her offspring in these

731
00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:58.375
different places shows that
she represents an important

732
00:42:58.442 --> 00:43:02.046
biological linkage between
these different habitats.

733
00:43:02.112 --> 00:43:03.180
NEIL: Incredible.

734
00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:04.315
JAMES: So given that.

735
00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:07.217
She’s potentially had many
children over her life time.

736
00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:09.954
TOBY: Yeah. she may
have grandchildren or even

737
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.156
great grandchildren
out there somewhere.

738
00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:13.791
JAMES: Awesome.

739
00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:18.095
<i>NARRATOR: There’s no sign yet</i>
<i>that Big Bull’s offspring are</i>

740
00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:19.797
<i>any bigger than normal.</i>

741
00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:22.333
<i>But there’s a lot of them.</i>

742
00:43:22.399 --> 00:43:26.403

743

<i>She also may</i>

744
00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:33.477
<i>And a important matriarch</i>
<i>of an enormous family.</i>

745
00:43:34.044 --> 00:43:35.779
NEIL: Encountering
such a large shark.

746
00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:38.882
for me. is actually
a sign of hope.

747
00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:44.288
It means that this animal
was able to make it past all

748
00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:47.257
the threats and
grow to be this size.

749
00:43:47.324 --> 00:43:49.860
It also means there are
likely other big Bull Sharks

750
00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:52.129
that are still out
there yet to be discovered.

751
