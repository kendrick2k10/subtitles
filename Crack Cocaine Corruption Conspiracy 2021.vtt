00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.733
[George] This news report came in
about Richard Pryor

170
00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:10.526
getting burnt up with this pipe.

171
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:15.239
He had used freebase. which is
a combination of cocaine and ether.

172
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.784
And when he ignited it. whether it was
on a cigarette. we don't know.

173
00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:23.372
the ether exploded. causing his clothes
to be engulfed in flames.

174
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.168
Y'all did some nasty ass jokes on my ass.

175
00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:28.878
[audience laughs]

176
00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:31.964
"What's that?"
"Richard Pryor running down the street."

177
00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.760
[George] I didn't know what freebase was.

178
00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:39.722
And Richard Pryor
burning himself up with it

179
00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:43.893
was kind of the wake-up call
to a lot of people

180
00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:47.355
that there was this other kind of way
of using cocaine.

181
00:10:47.438 --> 00:10:49.440
Cocaine is a molecule.

182
00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:51.233
It's called "cocaine hydrochloride."

183
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.738
And the hydrochloride portion is a salt.

184
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:58.908
And you can't smoke it
if that hydrochloride portion is on.

185
00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:00.785
so you gotta get rid of the salt.

186
00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:05.665
So. with freebasing. we figured out
how to just get rid of the salt.

187
00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:07.375
and now you just have the base.

188
00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.668
So we call it "freebase."

189
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:10.836
The base is free and you can smoke it.

190
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.213
Crack is the same thing.

191
00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:16.967
[Rick Ross] Most people.

192
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:18.761
they would cook it for themselves.

193
00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:20.846
Almost like being a scientist.

194
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.598
You know. it took a lot of...

195
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.518
mixing and...

196
00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:27.812
weighing.

197
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:31.440
What I figured out is that...

198
00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:35.111
people preferred
not to go through all that process.

199
00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:37.613
They would prefer
to have it already rocked up.

200
00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.115
And they call it "crack."

495
00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:54.798
A nine-year-old kid planning
his funeral with his mother.

496
00:27:54.881 --> 00:27:57.801

that he went to school with.

497
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:05.350
[Castaneda] It was. for people
who lived in these neighborhoods.

498
00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:07.060
a horrible. terrible time.

499
00:28:07.977 --> 00:28:10.313
And many of them had longstanding ties

500
00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:13.817
to the places and neighborhoods
where they lived.

501
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.237
They couldn't afford to just up and leave.

502
00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:24.285
So they lived with the stress
of living in. basically. a combat zone.

503
00:28:26.246 --> 00:28:30.500
People were afraid
to leave those homes that. at one time.

504
00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:33.378
they'd be out on the front stoop.
just hanging out. gossiping.

505
00:28:33.461 --> 00:28:36.589
They couldn't do it no more.
'cause now bullets are flying around.

506
00:28:37.757 --> 00:28:40.009
[reporter 1] Are you afraid
when you go out at night?

507
00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:41.261
-Yes.
-Why?

508
00:28:42.011 --> 00:28:44.639
There's a lot of crack dealers.
They'll be shooting.

509
00:28:45.223 --> 00:28:48.393
I'll stay in the house.
I don't wanna get shot.

510
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:52.272
I don't even walk the streets
around here at night.

511
00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:56.443
When I come in. I lock my door.
and this is where I stay.

512
00:28:56.526 --> 00:28:58.236

[woman] You look down

517
00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:12.459

while the police just turned his head.

518
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:23.595
[Pegues] One day.
I come out for my shift.

519
00:29:23.678 --> 00:29:25.096
I have 300 vials of crack.

520
00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.309
and the blue-and-whites roll up.
right inside the park. right up to me.

521
00:29:29.392 --> 00:29:31.352
He takes the bag.
"Show me what's in the bag."

522
00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:35.273
I give him the bag and I'm like.
"Damn. I'm going to jail forever."

523
00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:40.737
I'm thinking. should I run right now?
'Cause. yo. I'm dead.

524
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:41.863
And the guy goes...

525
00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.158
He looks in the bag. the cop.
There's two cops.

526
00:29:45.241 --> 00:29:48.578
He throws the bag back at me.
and looks at me and says.

527
00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:51.206
"Tell your boss I did you a favor."

528
00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:55.960
So. I run over to his house. like.
"Yo. you ain't gonna believe this shit.

529
00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:58.963
I just got popped by the cops.
The whole package."

530
00:29:59.047 --> 00:30:00.632
He's like. "What you talking about?

531
00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:03.593
Man. we paying them off.
Man. get your ass back out there."

532
00:30:03.676 --> 00:30:05.762
So. I'm like. "You serious?"

533
00:30:05.845 --> 00:30:08.681
He's like. "Get back out there to work.
We're losing money."

534
00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:13.436

And in so doing.
separated them from their families.

621

was wider on women.

My grief and my rage consumed me.

627
00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:48.002

628
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.256
When I used the crack.

629
00:34:52.965 --> 00:34:57.386

for that period.

633
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:14.237
[Pierce] When I started using this.
I was working. You understand?

634
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.697
I had just had my first daughter.

635

and everything.

636
00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:25.456
Soon as I get home from work. she'd eat.
I'd wash her up. I'd check her homework.

637
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:28.084
"Go take your bath."
Then we're going to bed.

638
00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:32.380
That used to be our routine
until I started messing with that crack.

639
00:35:33.172 --> 00:35:38.302
It got so far out of control...
to where I lost my children.

640
00:35:38.928 --> 00:35:41.556
You know. my sister had to take my kids.

641
00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:45.434

She was a newborn.

642
00:35:46.727 --> 00:35:47.562
And...

643
00:35:52.066 --> 00:35:53.359
She don't even know me.

644
00:35:54.986 --> 00:36:01.117
So many women that were mothers and aunts
that was just doing anything for crack.

645
00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.788
Once they started on that particular drug.
it was just a wrap.

646
00:36:05.872 --> 00:36:07.915
Once you're addicted.
you need to make money.

647
00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.792
A man could go out and beat someone up.

648
00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:11.169
A man could go out and rob.

649
00:36:11.294 --> 00:36:13.671
A man could go and do a B&amp;E.
breaking and entering.

650
00:36:13.754 --> 00:36:16.132
Women couldn't.
At least. they thought they couldn't.

651
00:36:16.215 --> 00:36:20.720
You would see women
selling their children's toys.

652
00:36:20.803 --> 00:36:23.222
You would see them doing the unthinkable.

653
00:36:23.306 --> 00:36:25.600

654
00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:28.019

the influence of crack.

655
00:36:28.978 --> 00:36:31.939

It was...
It felt extraordinarily hypocritical...

732
00:40:45.401 --> 00:40:49.488
because this was happening
at a time when the US government was

733
00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:53.367
turning a blind eye to cocaine smuggling
into the United States.

That government was overthrown

"We're not gonna tolerate

Marxists in Central America."

750
00:42:08.108 --> 00:42:11.695
so they started working
with bands of guerrillas...

the Marxist government in Nicaragua.

Those were the Contras.

want to give peace a chance.

00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:20.806
to put this policy of this administration
of support to Contras to bed.

768
00:43:21.348 --> 00:43:24.351
This was a policy
that was born in deception.

federal money to support the Contras.

775
00:43:43.412 --> 00:43:46.457
At that point. the Reagan administration
began to look

776
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.876
for alternative sources of funding.

777
00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:54.089
And one of those sources of funding became
profits from the sale of arms to Iran.

778
00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:00.638
We started selling
missiles and rockets to Iran. illegally.

779
00:44:00.721 --> 00:44:05.684
and taking the profit
that amounted to 15. 30 million dollars.

780
00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:08.145
that could be shifted to pay

781
00:44:08.228 --> 00:44:12.608
for what was now an illegal Contra war
that Congress would not fund.

782
00:44:17.029 --> 00:44:21.158
We worked with pilots
who were flying aid down to the Contras.

783
00:44:21.742 --> 00:44:24.203
And US officials
not just looked the other way.

784
00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:30.626
but collaborated with just about
any unsavory and dirty individual.

788
00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:44.890

in the realm of disbelief for me.

of cocaine smuggling

you could unload the guns
and put on duffel bags full of cocaine.

fly it back to the United States.

815

It profited for the Contras.

816
00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:26.742
It profited for the smugglers.

817
00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:30.454
It was a cozy arrangement
that worked for everyone.

00:46:30.537 --> 00:46:32.122

either looked the other way.

or collaborated with drug smugglers

the Sandinista government.

in Central America.

[announcer 1] So Bias comes out
for the steal.

826
00:47:04.571 --> 00:47:07.866
Nice move by Lenny Bias!
And gets the score and it...

827
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:11.870
One big turning point was Len Bias.

828
00:47:11.954 --> 00:47:14.164
a basketball star
at the University of Maryland.

829
00:47:14.832 --> 00:47:18.210
[announcer 2] Lead catch. Adrian Branch.
Great feed back to Bias!

830
00:47:18.794 --> 00:47:21.880
Everybody in Washington.
we knew who Len Bias was.

831
00:47:21.964 --> 00:47:25.926
People loved him.
He was an attractive and clean-cut guy.

832
00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:28.720
[announcer 3] Bias at the baseline.
goes by Hale. reverse!

833
00:47:28.804 --> 00:47:31.473
-[commentator] Oh. my!
-[announcer] Holy cow! What a shot!

834
00:47:31.557 --> 00:47:34.351
[Sterling] And his big rival
in the conference

835
00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:35.978
was down in North Carolina.

836
00:47:36.562 --> 00:47:38.772
[announcer] And Michael Jordan
guarding Len Bias.

837
00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:41.525
Big ball game.
Double clutch and he made it.

838
00:47:41.608 --> 00:47:43.902
Two of the finest athletes in the country.

839
00:47:43.986 --> 00:47:46.655
Michael Jordan and Bias.
going up side-by-side.

840
00:47:46.738 --> 00:47:48.198
Bias just out-hung him.

841
00:47:48.282 --> 00:47:51.410
[Sterling] His dream was
to play for the Celtics.

842
00:47:51.493 --> 00:47:54.037
The Boston Celtics select

843
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:56.832
Len Bias of the University of Maryland.

844
00:47:57.374 --> 00:47:59.918
[Sterling] And their top pick
was Len Bias.

845
00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:05.048
He goes back to his dormitory
at the University of Maryland. and...

846
00:48:05.132 --> 00:48:07.509
he's partying down with his friends.

847
00:48:08.927 --> 00:48:10.971
[man on phone] Send someone
as soon as you can.

848
00:48:13.181 --> 00:48:14.349
It's no joke.

849
00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:18.061
We're giving him mouth-to-mouth.

850
00:48:19.771 --> 00:48:21.148
This is Len Bias.

851
00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:24.943
You have to get him back to life.

852
00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:29.072
There's no way he can die.

853
00:48:30.866 --> 00:48:32.117
Send someone quick.

854
00:48:33.702 --> 00:48:37.080
A local success story
took a tragic turn this morning.

855
00:48:37.164 --> 00:48:40.125
Len Bias.
the Maryland University basketball star.

856
00:48:40.208 --> 00:48:43.378
on his way to becoming
a world champion Boston Celtic.

857
00:48:43.462 --> 00:48:45.213
died of an apparent heart attack today

858
00:48:45.297 --> 00:48:47.716
at Leland Memorial Hospital
in Prince George's County.

859
00:48:47.799 --> 00:48:51.303
[reporter] If police were shocked to hear
the news of Len Bias's sudden death.

860
00:48:51.386 --> 00:48:54.306
they were just as shocked to hear
crack may have been involved.

861
00:48:54.389 --> 00:48:56.934
Right now. police say
the case is labeled "suspicious".

862
00:48:57.017 --> 00:48:58.977
and that's all they're saying in public.

863
00:48:59.478 --> 00:49:03.023
Tonight. NBC's Jim Kaiserski reports
how the Len Bias tragedy

864
00:49:03.106 --> 00:49:05.859
is bringing the message home.
cocaine kills.

865
00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.945
[eerie music playing]

866
00:49:12.991 --> 00:49:16.244
[Hinton] When the media gets hold
of the story. the assumption is...

867
00:49:16.328 --> 00:49:17.996
that Len Bias had been smoking crack...

868
00:49:20.707 --> 00:49:23.251
and that had been responsible
for his death.

869
00:49:24.169 --> 00:49:27.547
Then he really becomes
the kind of poster child for crack

870
00:49:27.631 --> 00:49:29.841
and the beginning
of a new national discussion.

871
00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:33.929
The American media
had gotten a hold of "crack" now.

872
00:49:34.012 --> 00:49:38.016
And now it had taken
a different trajectory or narrative.

873
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:39.851
Not only did they say he smoked crack.

874
00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:41.979
they said it was
his first time smoking crack.

875
00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:45.774
"This is how powerful and dangerous
this drug was." they said.

876
00:49:47.526 --> 00:49:51.530
At Len Bias's funeral. Jesse Jackson says.

877
00:49:52.072 --> 00:49:56.743
"Dope has taken more Black lives
than the Ku Klux Klan rope."

878
00:49:58.328 --> 00:50:01.456
The following week. Don Rogers.

879
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.334
the cornerback for the Cleveland Browns...

880
00:50:05.752 --> 00:50:08.338
he dies of a cocaine-related death.

881
00:50:08.422 --> 00:50:10.966
They alluded to the fact
that he had crack.

882
00:50:11.466 --> 00:50:13.427
This is what the narrative was.

883
00:50:15.053 --> 00:50:18.015
"It's an epidemic! Of young Black men...

884
00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:21.309
strong athletes. dying from cocaine."

885
00:50:22.436 --> 00:50:25.647
So all over the country. people went.
"Cocaine." "Cocaine." "Cocaine!"

886
00:50:25.731 --> 00:50:27.691
The media is going bananas.

887
00:50:27.774 --> 00:50:30.027
The crack problem
has become a crack crisis.

888
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:31.486
and it's spreading nationwide.

889
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.947
Two words that were used
again and again for crack

890
00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:35.490
were "epidemic" and "plague."

891
00:50:35.574 --> 00:50:39.244
"The drug epidemic is as dangerous
as any terrorist that we face.

892
00:50:39.327 --> 00:50:42.330
It is serious.
It is an epidemic and it can kill."

893
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:45.542
Just some of what was said
to House and Senate committees...

894
00:50:45.625 --> 00:50:47.419
They were used to scare people.

895
00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:51.798
Politicians used them to scare people.
The media used them to scare people.

896
00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:52.716
And it worked.

897
00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:56.511
[reporter] The drug so powerful.
it will empty the money from your pockets.

898
00:50:56.595 --> 00:51:00.891
make you sell the watch off your wrist.
the clothes off your back...

899
00:51:01.016 --> 00:51:02.100
Or kill your mother.

900
00:51:04.853 --> 00:51:07.481
[Sterling] If I want
to show the drug problem.

901
00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:10.901
send the camera crew
down to Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue.

902
00:51:10.984 --> 00:51:13.653
and we'll show some young Black men

903
00:51:13.737 --> 00:51:17.074
sitting on a stoop
or standing in front of a store.

904
00:51:17.657 --> 00:51:21.036
"There's the crack problem!
There they are! There they are!"

905
00:51:21.119 --> 00:51:22.871
What CBS News called Crack Street

906
00:51:22.954 --> 00:51:26.208
clearly stretches into cities and towns
across the nation.

907
00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:29.461
[reporter] Los Angeles gangs
have franchised crack operations

908
00:51:29.544 --> 00:51:30.879
in more than 25 cities.

909
00:51:31.463 --> 00:51:34.633
Towns as unlikely as Omaha.
Kansas City. Denver.

910
00:51:34.716 --> 00:51:37.803
Even York. Pennsylvania.
Bedrock Middle America.

911
00:51:39.513 --> 00:51:43.183
The media was generating these frenzies
about crack and its impact.

912
00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:44.643
who was using crack and where.

913
00:51:44.726 --> 00:51:47.521
Police in Kansas City. Missouri
are searching this morning

914
00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:52.150
for a woman who swapped her infant son
for $20 worth of crack-cocaine.

915
00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:55.320
The four-month-old boy
was turned over to social workers.

916
00:51:55.403 --> 00:52:00.283
We see stereotypes about
the. kind of. pathology of Black women

917
00:52:00.367 --> 00:52:03.954
and Black women mothers.
poor Black women mothers.

918
00:52:04.037 --> 00:52:06.081
get translated in the context of crack.

919
00:52:06.164 --> 00:52:09.459
The crack plague is showing
a new and frightening dimension.

920
00:52:09.543 --> 00:52:12.754
the damage it does
to the children of crack addicts.

921
00:52:12.838 --> 00:52:15.674
Investigative report tonight.
cocaine kids.

922
00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:18.301
Infants born to cocaine-addict mothers.

923
00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:21.471
[Geraldo Rivera] Her mother was
so stoned at the time of delivery.

924
00:52:21.555 --> 00:52:25.851
she didn't realize until sometime
the next day that she had given birth.

925
00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:33.441
The whole crack baby thing
was based largely on one paper published

926
00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:39.489
by a guy named Ira Chasnoff.
a Chicago pediatrician.

927
00:52:41.908 --> 00:52:46.454
[Lynn M. Paltrow] Ira Chasnoff suggested
that there were extreme and unique harms

928
00:52:46.538 --> 00:52:48.874
from prenatal exposure to cocaine.

929
00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:52.335
His research.
based on approximately 23 babies.

930
00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:54.880
could not. should not. ever have led

931
00:52:54.963 --> 00:52:57.632
to the kind of alarm
and reporting that happened.

932
00:52:57.716 --> 00:52:59.009
-Drug babies--
-Coke babies--

933
00:52:59.092 --> 00:53:02.137
Crack kids.
They have now reached school age.

934
00:53:02.429 --> 00:53:04.681
[Paltrow] There was
hyperventilating reporting

935
00:53:04.764 --> 00:53:07.100
in everything from the New York Times

936
00:53:07.184 --> 00:53:09.561
to "Crack Kids" in TIME Magazine.

937
00:53:10.353 --> 00:53:12.689
And you had headlines such as.

938
00:53:12.772 --> 00:53:15.901
"Crack Babies:
The Worst Threat Is Mom Herself."

939
00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:20.947
And those stories featured
pictures of Black children.

940
00:53:22.157 --> 00:53:24.492
[sighs] It's hard
to really talk about this.

941
00:53:24.576 --> 00:53:25.785
'cause it was such bullshit.

942
00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:30.457
Stuff like that actually paraded
as real information.

943
00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:34.002
And so that played a large role
in this notion of "crack babies."

944
00:53:34.085 --> 00:53:37.923
Of course. we now know it was a lie.
We now know that.

945
00:53:38.006 --> 00:53:40.258
It was the epidemic that was not.

946
00:53:41.259 --> 00:53:45.513
[Dan Rather] One hundred thousand
crack babies are being born each year.

947
00:53:45.597 --> 00:53:48.225
And now it appears
they may be damaged for life.

948
00:53:48.308 --> 00:53:51.853
[reporter] A potential horror story
as these children reach school age.

949
00:53:51.937 --> 00:53:56.942
In a few short years. these children may
comprise as many as 60% of students

950
00:53:57.025 --> 00:53:58.902
in some inner-city classes.

951
00:54:00.028 --> 00:54:04.282
[Hinton] In reality.
only two to three percent of children born

952
00:54:04.366 --> 00:54:08.286
during this period were discovered
to have any cocaine in their system.

953
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.749
The real. kind of. maternal issue

954
00:54:12.832 --> 00:54:15.460
had to do much more
with alcohol abuse and marijuana.

955
00:54:15.543 --> 00:54:17.921
Yet that's what gets sold
to the American public.

956
00:54:18.004 --> 00:54:21.925
and also introduces
a new kind of level of criminalization.

957
00:54:22.008 --> 00:54:23.260
in the lives of Black women

958
00:54:23.343 --> 00:54:25.762
living in communities
that are already being targeted.

959
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.392
[imperceptible]

960
00:54:30.517 --> 00:54:32.936
[Jennifer Johnson] I was abandoned
by my children's father

961
00:54:33.019 --> 00:54:34.938
and I felt very alone and isolated.

962
00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:37.357
In my crisis.

963
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:43.071
I shared with my doctor that. you know.
I had a substance abuse issue.

964
00:54:43.154 --> 00:54:46.283
And he literally turned my case
over to the police.

965
00:54:47.367 --> 00:54:51.037
Despite the fact that she was
completely honest about her drug problem

966
00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:54.958
in the hope that medical people.
the healthcare system.

967
00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:57.919
would somehow connect her
to treatment she needed.

968
00:54:58.003 --> 00:55:01.548
instead she was arrested
and charged with child abuse

969
00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:03.466
and delivery of drugs to a minor.

970
00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:07.178
as if she were a drug dealer
or a drug peddler.

971
00:55:09.931 --> 00:55:12.851
[reporter] Last year. a Florida woman
was convicted of administering

972
00:55:12.934 --> 00:55:15.979
cocaine to a minor. 
via the umbilical cord.

973
00:55:16.062 --> 00:55:18.606
Several other states
are trying the same thing.

974
00:55:19.691 --> 00:55:22.235
[Paltrow] We believe
it was the first time a prosecutor

975
00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:25.905
charged a woman
with dealing drugs to her newborn

976
00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.908
in the 60 seconds after the baby was born.

977
00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:31.703
but while the umbilical cord
was still attached.

978
00:55:32.954 --> 00:55:35.206
They had no direct evidence whatsoever

979
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:38.710
that in fact there was
any transfer of anything.

980
00:55:38.793 --> 00:55:41.546
So. what was being punished?
What was the crime?

981
00:55:41.629 --> 00:55:43.715
I was able to deliver two healthy babies.

982
00:55:43.798 --> 00:55:47.802
Despite the myth
and scientific misinformation.

983
00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:51.139
But my family was being divided.

984
00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:55.560
And my kids went
to long-term relative care. out of state.

985
00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:57.562
It was devastating.

986
00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:03.193
The judge had
no understanding of addiction.

987
00:56:03.276 --> 00:56:06.488
which was. she didn't have choice.
she didn't have control.

988
00:56:06.571 --> 00:56:08.490
She needed help. She asked for help.

989
00:56:08.573 --> 00:56:12.077
She wasn't able to get that help.
It was never offered to her.

990
00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.162
It didn't exist
at the time she was asking.

And she would secretly search pregnant
Black women for evidence of cocaine use.

You wanna just tell me
how you obtain your drugs? Is it...

[sad instrumental music playing]

1007
00:57:12.345 --> 00:57:15.598
[Asha Bandele] It was a concerted effort
to criminalize Black women.

1008
00:57:15.682 --> 00:57:17.767
The way you could
criminalize Black women.

1009
00:57:17.851 --> 00:57:19.853
or you could criminalize
virtually any woman.

1010
00:57:19.936 --> 00:57:23.314
is by saying she's harming children.

to sign legislation

1132
01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:34.769
that reflects the total commitment
of the American people

to fight the evil of drugs.

1135
01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:48.407
It was the most unjust federal law
ever written.

It has a ratio of powder cocaine...

1137
01:03:53.579 --> 01:03:56.123
100 grams gets you a certain sentence.

1138
01:03:56.207 --> 01:03:58.876
one gram of crack
gets you the same sentence.

1139
01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:05.299
If you've seen a sugar packet
in the restaurant. that's one gram.

1140
01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.594
There's a tiny amount of stuff.

1141
01:04:09.136 --> 01:04:15.268
Five of those tiny amounts of crack
would get you a minimum of five years.

1142
01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:20.690
up to 40 years
under the legislation that passed.

1143
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:27.280
Five grams of crack.
500 grams of powder cocaine...

1144
01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:29.240
the same sentence.

1145
01:04:31.075 --> 01:04:32.827
Many people thought.

1146
01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:36.414
"Well. that must be because

1147
01:04:36.497 --> 01:04:43.004
Congress thought that crack was 100 times
more dangerous than powder cocaine."

1148
01:04:43.087 --> 01:04:43.921
No.

1149
01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:47.550
This was a feature of the haste
with which we wrote this.

1150
01:04:47.633 --> 01:04:52.889
So fast we're not even thinking straight
about what we're trying to accomplish.

1151
01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:54.223
It was a screw-up.

1152
01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:57.560
It was screw-up on top of screw-up
on top of screw-up.

1153
01:04:58.144 --> 01:05:00.271
That happened in 1986.

1154
01:05:00.354 --> 01:05:03.190
And that law targeted "traffickers".

1155
01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:07.486
That's... 1988. they extended that law

1156
01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:11.324
to include anybody
who possessed crack-cocaine.

1157
01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:14.577
The decision in the 1988 legislation

1158
01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:17.622
to associate a mandatory minimum penalty

1159
01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:20.958
with the possession
of a small amount of crack-cocaine

1160
01:05:21.042 --> 01:05:24.003
was part of a larger shift and a decision

1161
01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:26.672
on the part of officials
in the Reagan administration

1162
01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:29.008
to criminalize drug abusers.

1163
01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:33.095
and specifically to criminalize
people who abused crack.

1164
01:05:34.221 --> 01:05:38.059
[sighs] The thinking
at the time was that...

1165
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:42.939
crack... was being used...

1166
01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:48.069
more openly in the Black community.

1167
01:05:48.152 --> 01:05:51.530
and cocaine was a secret drug

1168
01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:55.493
that middle class people used
that didn't hurt anybody.

1169
01:05:55.576 --> 01:05:58.496
They weren't mugging. they weren't
killing. they weren't robbing.

1170
01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:05.670
The whole idea. if you could concentrate
on where the most damage to society was...

1171
01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:09.632
And it was overkill.
Clearly. it was overkill.

1172
01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:11.926
There was no justification.

1173
01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:15.179
And I guess the best answer to it...

1174
01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:19.642
is an oft-time phrase that you've heard.

1175
01:06:19.725 --> 01:06:22.186
"Seemed like a good idea at the time."

1176

1177
01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:32.655
"I will faithfully execute the office...."

1178
01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:35.032
[Michael Isikoff] In 1989.

1179
01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:37.952
the polls show that drugs were

1180
01:06:38.035 --> 01:06:42.123
the number-one issue
that the public was concerned about.

1181
01:06:42.748 --> 01:06:45.960
So. George H.W. Bush had come into office

1182
01:06:46.043 --> 01:06:52.967
vowing to crack down on the drug epidemic
that was confronting the country.

1183
01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:54.885
[Bush] My friends. we have work to do.

1184
01:06:55.636 --> 01:07:00.599
There are those who cannot free themselves
of enslavement to whatever addiction.

1185
01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:05.312
drugs. welfare.
the demoralization that rules the slums.

1186
01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:09.525
[Isikoff] Remember. George H.W. Bush
was Reagan's vice president.

1187
01:07:09.608 --> 01:07:13.863
He actually had been
in charge of anti-drug operations

1188
01:07:13.946 --> 01:07:17.867
for the White House in the early years
of the Reagan Administration.

1189
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:23.164
So. he had every reason to want to show

1190
01:07:23.247 --> 01:07:25.458
he was gonna be tougher than anybody.

1191
01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:28.127
[Bush] There are few clear areas

1192
01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:32.882
in which we as a society
must rise up united

1193
01:07:33.382 --> 01:07:35.134
and express our intolerance.

1194
01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:37.970
And the most obvious now is drugs.

1195
01:07:38.637 --> 01:07:40.181
And there is much to be done...

1196
01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:41.766
and to be said.

1197
01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:46.896
But take my word for it.
this scourge will stop!

1198
01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:52.526
[Levine] The political attention
on the drug issue

1199
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.528
and the crack issue was escalating.

1200
01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:59.742
Drugs become almost the antithesis
of the American way of life.

1201
01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:02.620
Drugs is the enemy that we must destroy.

1202

[eerie music playing]

1203
01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:08.918
[Scott] I was working with DEA.

1204
01:08:09.001 --> 01:08:12.671
And I was asked to purchase drugs
in front of the White House one day.

1205
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:18.177
So... I called one of the drug dealers
I'd been dealing with.

1206
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.887
I said. "Come to the White House."

1207
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.514
He said. "Where the fuck is that?"

1208
01:08:23.307 --> 01:08:25.309
I had to actually tell him
how to get there.

1209
01:08:25.392 --> 01:08:28.020
When he came down there.
we sat on the little park bench.

1210
01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.022
He gave me the drugs.
I gave him the money.

You can see the people in the background
going into the White House.

1212
01:08:34.985 --> 01:08:39.782
All of us agree that the gravest domestic
threat facing our nation today is drugs.

1213
01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.702
[Isikoff] This was
President George H.W. Bush's

1214
01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:47.540
first national TV address.

1215
01:08:47.623 --> 01:08:49.834
I remember watching it. and. uh...

1216
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:54.088
the President had this...

1217
01:08:55.339 --> 01:08:58.134
gimmick that nobody expected.

1218
01:08:58.217 --> 01:08:59.135
This...

1219
01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:02.471
This is crack-cocaine.

Lo and behold. George Bush holds up
the drugs I just bought. on TV.

I almost fell out of my chair.

1224

It was crazy. I could not believe that.
I couldn't believe it.

1225
01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:22.908
Because it was a setup.

1226
01:09:24.785 --> 01:09:27.204
It's as innocent-looking as candy.

1227
01:09:27.288 --> 01:09:29.999
But it's turning our cities
into battle zones.

1228
01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:33.377
It was a case of political theater.

1229

The White House manipulating
a real... young kid...

1230

for political purposes in order
to score and make a political point.

1231

Here. the rules have changed.

1232
01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:52.021
If you sell drugs. you will be caught.

1233

And when you're caught.
you will be prosecuted.

1234

And once you're convicted.
you will do time.

1235
01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.864
The White House acknowledged today
that a dramatic moment

1236
01:10:01.947 --> 01:10:04.867
in President Bush's speech
declaring war on drugs

1237

that I've never been before.

1319
01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:49.443
I don't know where I'm going.

1320
01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:55.199
And as I'm taking this trip.
I'm thinking about my ancestors.

1321
01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:58.744
And I think of.
"What progress have we actually made?"

1322
01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.417
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen.

1323
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:09.463
the President
of the United States of America.

1324
01:15:09.546 --> 01:15:11.840
William Jefferson Clinton.

1325
01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:15.719
[Sterling] Bush played an important role
in laying the groundwork.

1326
01:15:15.802 --> 01:15:18.514
but Clinton. then.
has to be even tougher...

1327
01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.557
because that's the thing.

1328
01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.142
People have got to be tougher.

1329
01:15:27.105 --> 01:15:31.193
We will have the means by which we can
say punishment will be more certain.

1330
01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:37.533
We will put 100.000 police officers
on the street. a 20% increase.

1331
01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:38.659
Go! Move! Move! Move!

1332
01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:41.119
[eerie music playing]

1333
01:15:42.162 --> 01:15:42.996
Get down!

1334
01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:46.083
The war on drugs
helped turn the police into soldiers.

1335
01:15:51.755 --> 01:15:54.091
All right. Hold it.
Hold it. Freeze! Freeze!

1336
01:15:54.174 --> 01:15:56.426
[Hinton] Tens of millions
of dollars from Congress

1337
01:15:56.510 --> 01:16:00.806
goes to helicopters
and to militarizing police forces.

1338
01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:15.612
There is restructuring of policing
from ordinary beat cops

1339
01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:18.907
to creating these elite. funded units

1340
01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:21.952
that are given special resources
and special powers.

1341
01:16:23.787 --> 01:16:26.498
[Hinton] We begin to see
a new level of investment

1342
01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:29.918
into targeting
low-income communities of color...

1343
01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:32.462
with policing and surveillance.

1344
01:16:32.546 --> 01:16:36.842
while making sentences
more Draconian and more punitive.

1345
01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:38.302
[explosion]

1346
01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:40.554
[man] My wife and kids are in there. man.

1347
01:16:41.179 --> 01:16:42.764
Oh. my God!

1348
01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:47.311
The federal anti-drug budget
is up to $12 billion.

1349
01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:50.272
So. it's six times what it was
when Reagan started.

1350
01:16:50.355 --> 01:16:51.648
and it keeps climbing.

1351
01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:53.650
[Bill Clinton] When I sign
this crime bill.

1352
01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:57.863
we together are taking a big step

1353
01:16:57.946 --> 01:17:00.782
toward bringing
the laws of our land back into line

1354
01:17:00.866 --> 01:17:02.826
with the values of our people.

1355
01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:13.211
[Hinton] The 1994 crime bill supports
new police officers on the streets

1356
01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:16.340
of not just big cities
like New York and Chicago.

1357
01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:20.886
but smaller cities like your Indiana
and Flint and Stockton. California.

1358
01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:29.603
There's tens of millions of dollars
going into expanding the prison system.

1359
01:17:29.686 --> 01:17:32.272
And that is when
we really begin to see the explosion

1360
01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:34.775
of prison populations in the US.

1361
01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:40.238
[Hart] Incarceration rates
take off under Clinton.

1362
01:17:40.864 --> 01:17:41.990
But then...

1363
01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:47.496
about the same time. '94.
people start to become concerned

1364
01:17:47.579 --> 01:17:51.583
that the people who were
being arrested for crack

1365
01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.585
were almost exclusively Black.

1366
01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:57.881
[Murch] Two-thirds
of crack users were white.

1367
01:17:58.548 --> 01:18:02.552
But between the passage
of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act in 1988

1368
01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:05.764
and 1994.
the passage of Clinton's crime bill.

1369
01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:10.185
not a single white person was convicted

1370
01:18:10.268 --> 01:18:13.522
of a federal crack offense in Los Angeles.

1371
01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:40.382
[Murch] There is just massive outrage
in the African-American community

1372
01:18:40.465 --> 01:18:42.008
about mass incarceration.

1373
01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:45.303
and also about the damage
inflicted by the crack economy itself.

1374
01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:54.730
Much of the anger
became focused on the CIA...

1375
01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:59.067
and its role in helping
to create the crack crisis.

1376
01:18:59.526 --> 01:19:01.570
It doesn't make any difference.

1377
01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:04.656
Whether they delivered the kilo themselves

1378
01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.117
or turned their heads
while somebody else did it.

1379
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:08.869
they're just as guilty.

1380
01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:14.958
I am going to make somebody pay
for what they have done

1381
01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:17.836
to my community and to my people.

1382
01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:18.920
[crowd applauds]

1383
01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:24.593
I think the CIA is involved.

1384
01:19:24.676 --> 01:19:27.345
The CIA's been involved
in every ugly thing that's happened

1385
01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:29.139
over the last 20 or 30 years.

1386
01:19:29.222 --> 01:19:30.849
We are your wake-up call!

1387
01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:33.393
[Kornbluh] The crack epidemic
affected the poverty levels.

1388
01:19:33.477 --> 01:19:35.479
the safety levels of communities.

1389
01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:38.148
People's health was affected.

1390
01:19:38.231 --> 01:19:41.401
People's lives were ended or changed.

1391
01:19:41.485 --> 01:19:42.944
People lost their freedom.

1392
01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:45.363
[woman] I'm not bringing drugs
into the country.

1393
01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:47.407
See. there are people in major positions

1394
01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:48.950
-that are doing this.
-Has to be.

1395
01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:51.620
[Kornbluh] So. it is
certainly understandable

1396
01:19:51.703 --> 01:19:55.415
why a community that was
so disproportionately affected

1397
01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:57.918
would rise up in disgust and horror

1398
01:19:58.001 --> 01:20:03.465
at any implication that the US government
was even a little bit involved

1399
01:20:03.548 --> 01:20:06.426
in drugs coming into their community.

1400
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:08.929
[dramatic music playing]

1401
01:20:10.096 --> 01:20:15.393
Los Angeles was the epicenter for crack
in the 1980s and 1990s.

1402
01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:18.814
Much of the anger in Los Angeles
spills over into the rest of the country.

1403
01:20:18.897 --> 01:20:22.108
and LA becomes the center.
the epicenter of organizing.

1404
01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:30.200
And this organizing ultimately forces
the head of the CIA. John Deutch.

1405
01:20:30.283 --> 01:20:35.247
to come to Los Angeles
and to speak at a high school in Watts.

1406
01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:40.043
The director of the CIA
was in Los Angeles today.

1407
01:20:40.126 --> 01:20:43.338
trying to put down reports
that the CIA. in the past.

1408
01:20:43.421 --> 01:20:47.259
connived to spread crack-cocaine
in America's inner cities.

1409
01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:54.724
[Murch] It's this moment. essentially.
of the community confronting the CIA.

1410
01:20:55.642 --> 01:21:00.689
In Baldwin Village where I live.
there are no jobs for the children.

1411
01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:03.817
And our kids are commodities.

1412
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.403
They're being cycled through the prisons.

1413
01:21:06.486 --> 01:21:07.779
They come back to the street

1414
01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:11.283
and they're marked and scarred
for the rest of their life.

1415
01:21:12.075 --> 01:21:14.828
We are tired and we're hurt.
and we're angry.

1416
01:21:15.453 --> 01:21:18.123
Give us explanations.

1417
01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:22.210
You. the President. and everybody else
should be highly upset...

1418
01:21:23.086 --> 01:21:26.089
and say. "How did this cancer get here?

1419
01:21:26.756 --> 01:21:27.799
How did it happen?"

1420
01:21:28.466 --> 01:21:29.926
[Deutch] Now. we all know

1421
01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:33.054
that the US government 
and the CIA supported

1422
01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:35.181
the Contras and their efforts to overthrow

1423
01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:39.269
the Sandinista government in Nicaragua
in the middle-'80s.

1424
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:45.775
Now. it is alleged the CIA also helped
the Contras raise money for arms

1425
01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:49.821
by introducing
crack-cocaine into California.

1426
01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:51.865
It is an appalling charge.

1427
01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.784
It is a charge that cannot go unanswered.

1428
01:21:55.619 --> 01:22:00.248
I've asked the CIA Inspector General
to undertake a full investigation.

1429
01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:03.793
I think it's pretty evident
that the sentiment in this room

1430
01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:07.005
is that of pain. anger.
and especially that of mistrust.

1431
01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:10.008
How can we feel comfortable
with an investigation

1432
01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:13.219
that's going to be conducted by someone
on the government payroll

1433
01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:15.388
to investigate the CIA in its wrongdoing?

1434
01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:16.556
[crowd applauds]

1435
01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.016
This is some bullshit. buddy.

1436
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.268
[crowd applauds]

1437
01:22:21.645 --> 01:22:23.813
[cheering]

1438
01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:25.273
[woman] Wait just a minute.

1439
01:22:30.487 --> 01:22:35.408
[Kornbluh] The CIA's Inspector General
did do a rather large report.

1440
01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:38.870
And. in fact. it did contain
a series of new revelations

1441
01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:41.790
about the extent to which
the CIA either looked the other way.

1442
01:22:41.873 --> 01:22:46.086
knew about.
or collaborated with drug smugglers

1443
01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:48.713
in their quest to overthrow
the Sandinista government.

1444
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:54.260
The Reagan administration cared less
about cocaine coming into this country

1445
01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:58.014
than they did about waging
an illegal paramilitary war

1446
01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.768
against a little country
in Central America

1447
01:23:01.851 --> 01:23:04.562
that basically represented no threat

1448
01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.107
to the security
of the United States of America.

1449
01:23:12.404 --> 01:23:15.407
Drugs. of course. do represent a threat.

1450
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:25.583
If you got a war on drugs...
is it not a war on the people

1451
01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:27.127
that are supplying the drugs?

1452
01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:30.380
Or is it only a war
on the victims of the drug war?

1453
01:23:30.463 --> 01:23:31.923
That was the hypocrisy.

1454
01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:36.261
And... sadly... we never addressed it.

1455
01:23:37.303 --> 01:23:40.223
People died. Communities are ravaged.

1456
01:23:40.306 --> 01:23:43.393
Nothing ever was done.

1457
01:23:43.977 --> 01:23:47.272
We left the communities of color
to be devastated.

1458
01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:03.496
[Burton] I was sentenced to prison
six different times.

1459
01:24:05.665 --> 01:24:09.252
You would have thought
someone would have said...

1460
01:24:11.379 --> 01:24:13.923
that you don't have a criminal problem...

1461
01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.428
you have an alcohol or a drug problem.

1462
01:24:19.512 --> 01:24:20.889
And there's help for that.

1463
01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:25.101
But I was never offered any help.

1464
01:24:27.103 --> 01:24:28.938
And I read the papers today...

1465
01:24:31.274 --> 01:24:33.818
and I look
at the approach to opioid use...

1466
01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:36.821
and you hear about a health approach.

1467
01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:40.116
Not a criminal approach.

1468
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.828
I'm 21 years sober now.

1469
01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:48.583
Wasn't I worth an investment in treatment?

1470
01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:00.053
[softly] I'm sorry.

1471
01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.055
[sniffles]

1472
01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:07.060
[sighs] For the past...

1473
01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:11.773
20-some years...

1474
01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:15.193
I've been living with PTSD.

1475
01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:18.905
It really started once I got shot.

1476
01:25:20.323 --> 01:25:24.536
And every now and again. you know.
I might have a bipolar episode.

1477
01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:26.329
Mood swings here and there.

1478
01:25:26.412 --> 01:25:28.373
I have anxiety. you know.

1479
01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:31.042
So. I mean. these are things
that I have to deal with

1480
01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:32.877
because of the choices that I made.

1481
01:25:34.712 --> 01:25:35.547
Yep.

1482
01:25:40.426 --> 01:25:42.303
[Styles] I was shot in 1988.

1483
01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:44.097
Five times.

1484
01:25:45.265 --> 01:25:46.975
I went away for three years.

1485
01:25:47.058 --> 01:25:51.229
I got locked up
for gun possession and drug possession.

1486
01:25:52.730 --> 01:25:54.149
I really lost myself.

1487
01:25:56.359 --> 01:25:58.236
I have plenty of regrets...

1488
01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:02.615
for the role I played in the crack era.

1489
01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:04.200
Um...

1490
01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:06.619
I lost a lot of friends.

1491
01:26:07.412 --> 01:26:09.289
A lot of friends. Almost all of them.

1492
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.207
I lost my job.

1493
01:26:12.292 --> 01:26:13.626
I lost my home.

1494
01:26:14.752 --> 01:26:19.132
It made me lose everything.
Everything. And...

1495
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:23.970
I got to the point
where I didn't care no more.

1496
01:26:24.053 --> 01:26:28.016
Especially after I asked my sister
to take my girls.

1497
01:26:32.061 --> 01:26:34.606
It changed me
from the person that I was...

1498
01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:37.692
to where I'm at now.

1499
01:26:41.946 --> 01:26:43.489
Oh. my God.

1500
01:26:48.786 --> 01:26:50.538
I have to think about my cousins.

1501
01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:52.957
My friends...

1502
01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:57.337
who were put in the system

1503
01:26:58.421 --> 01:26:59.589
before 18...

1504
01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:03.343
because of this thing we're calling crack.

1505
01:27:03.426 --> 01:27:05.428
[sad instrumental music playing]

1506
01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:13.311
[Hart] There's a proverb.

1507
01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:18.274
I went back to my old neighborhood
and I yelled. "Where are my friends?"

1508
01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:21.527
And an echo came back and said.

1509
01:27:21.611 --> 01:27:23.071
"Where are my friends?"

1510
01:27:44.008 --> 01:27:46.010
[ethereal music playing]
