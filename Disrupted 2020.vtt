3
00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:28.778
When I was a kid.
my mama had this dog.

4
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.183
It was a little poodle named
Sammy.

5
00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:35.719
He used to do all kind a tricks
like

6
00:00:35.752 --> 00:00:38.289
walk on his hind legs.
spin around in circles.

7
00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:40.623
You know. all that cute
little poodle shit.

8
00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.028
Then one day my mama was walking
him

9
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:47.131
and she ran into this pit
bull and it looked mean

10
00:00:47.164 --> 00:00:49.733
but she gave it the benefit of
the doubt.

11
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.569
She put her hand out to pet
it and it growled at her.

12
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.273
Well little Sammy.

13
00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:57.741
he wanted to protect her from
that pit.

14
00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:00.144
So he started barking
at it and that was all

15
00:01:00.177 --> 00:01:02.313
it took for that pit to put
little Sammy on his back.

16
00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:04.647
wrap his jaw around his neck and
kill him.

17
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:10.287
Mama didn't do nothing about it.

18
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.522
She thought maybe it was Sammy's
fault.

19
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:15.925
He shouldn't a barked.

20
00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:28.172
- Calvin?
- Hi. Amy?

21
00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:29.273
- Hey.
- Hey.

22
00:01:32.343 --> 00:01:34.178
You know. I forgot something
inside.

23
00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:35.578
I'm just gonna run back in

24
00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:36.780
and you know what. you can go
ahead.

25
00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:38.915
I'm just gonna catch another
ride.

26
00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:39.984
Are you sure? I mean. it's all
good.

27
00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:41.551
I don't mind waiting for you.

28
00:01:44.088 --> 00:01:45.222
I'm not in a hurry or anything.

29
00:01:46.957 --> 00:01:47.924
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:50.094
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:06.210
A couple of weeks
passed.

32
00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:08.678
The pit did the same thing
to her neighbor's cat

33
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.948
and then to the laundromat
owner's dog.

34
00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:23.227
Mama always felt guilty that

35
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.995
she never warned nobody about
pit.

You can't see me but
I can see you. Patrick.

42
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:54.024
It's an invasion of privacy.

43
00:02:54.058 --> 00:02:55.792
I can't even skinny dip anymore.

44
00:02:55.825 --> 00:03:00.030
People think being a celebrity
is easy and they're right.

45
00:03:00.064 --> 00:03:01.898
thanks to Alpha Nodrun Security.

46
00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:04.801
I hate drones.

47
00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:07.138
What's up? The signal's
gone.

48
00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:09.406
Where's my drone?

49
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.941
Thanks.
Alpha Nodrun Security.

50
00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:16.413
That's it?

51
00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:27.891
I like the fact that you're
using drones

52
00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:31.694
as not only part of the
problem but also the solution.

53
00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:32.396
Yeah.

54
00:03:35.332 --> 00:03:36.200
Cool.

55
00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:39.003
We think we can start with

56
00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:42.206
high end security for
clients like celebrities.

57
00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:44.841
How far along is it?

58
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:49.746
Ready for you to try
a full-fledged demo.

59
00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.320
Do you think you guys could
take a trip up to Tahoe?

60
00:03:56.353 --> 00:04:00.224
I've got a property up there
on the lake. about 10 acres.

61
00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:03.460
Absolutely. thank you
for the opportunity.

62
00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:07.131
Look. I get pitched
about 30 phone apps a week.

63
00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.766
But as a venture capitalist.

64
00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.037
I find your technology to be
refreshing.

65
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.839
Well like the video
says. it keeps people out.

66
00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:19.376
I'm not sure about the bears
though.

67
00:04:22.112 --> 00:04:22.980
You know. Tahoe.

68
00:04:24.215 --> 00:04:25.082
Bears.

69
00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.717
Cabin.

70
00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:30.787
Thank you guys.

71
00:04:34.124 --> 00:04:36.126
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

72
00:05:30.581 --> 00:05:32.182
I still need you to clean

73
00:05:32.216 --> 00:05:35.019
and to restock the
bathrooms before you split.

74
00:05:35.052 --> 00:05:36.153
- Yes sir.
- Okay.

75
00:05:53.903 --> 00:05:56.540
You taking a $15 an hour
stroll?

76
00:06:01.345 --> 00:06:04.048
I got a Tom Cushing on
the line in there for you.

77
00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.949
That's your probation officer.
right?

78
00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:11.588
97. that's how many days you
got left

79
00:06:11.622 --> 00:06:14.191
not to violate and fuck up your
parole.

80
00:06:14.224 --> 00:06:15.426
Yeah.

81
00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:18.128
A parolee starts missing
meetings

82
00:06:18.162 --> 00:06:21.931
and showing up late for work.
my mind starts to wonder

83
00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:24.901
that maybe I oughta to start
mentioning some of this

84
00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:27.604
shit in my reports. you
know. just to cover my ass.

85
00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:29.606
I don't think either one
of us wants that. do we?

86
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.242
Listen. I'm not gonna
say anything if you don't.

87
00:06:34.044 --> 00:06:36.913
Just make sure your ass is
at that meeting tonight. man.

88
00:06:38.015 --> 00:06:38.881
I gotta go.

89
00:06:41.952 --> 00:06:44.154
I'm Gary. I'm an
alcoholic.

90
00:06:44.188 --> 00:06:46.223
Hey. Gary.

91
00:06:46.256 --> 00:06:48.158
The holidays are coming up.

92
00:06:49.126 --> 00:06:50.527
Crazy. right?

93
00:06:53.097 --> 00:06:57.434
Needless to say. the
holidays are tough on me

94
00:06:57.468 --> 00:07:01.472
and I know a lot of you
feel the same way and so

95
00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:05.275
let's just be especially there
for one another right now.

96
00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:09.446
You know. I wouldn't make
it through without you guys.

97
00:07:11.415 --> 00:07:12.983
Thank you.

98
00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:14.985
Thanks. Gary.

99
00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:15.953
Anyone else?

100
00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:19.356
Kyle?

101
00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:24.161
I don't really wanna talk
about it.

102
00:07:25.329 --> 00:07:26.196
That's it.

103
00:07:26.997 --> 00:07:30.033
- Thanks. Kyle.
- Thank you. Kyle.

104
00:07:30.067 --> 00:07:31.602
How about the birthday boy

105
00:07:32.503 --> 00:07:35.539
with his brand new six year
chip?

106
00:07:35.572 --> 00:07:37.674
Hold up your chip. Pete. come
on.

107
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.078
- Say it. Pete.
- Yeah. Pete.

108
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:43.913
All right. I guess I'll go.

109
00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:48.285
My name's Pete and I'm an
alcoholic.

110
00:07:48.318 --> 00:07:49.253
Hey Pete.

111
00:07:49.286 --> 00:07:51.622
I used to think drinking was
my problem.

112
00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:57.494
then I met Gary and I quickly
found out I was full of shit.

113
00:07:57.728 --> 00:08:01.165
Quickly? I think it
took about a year. Pete.

114
00:08:02.499 --> 00:08:04.268
It turns out my issue was
anger.

115
00:08:05.436 --> 00:08:09.640
Justified anger is the worst
kind of anger for an alcoholic

116
00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:14.944
and I found that out the hard
way.

117
00:08:16.213 --> 00:08:17.714
across the Bay in San Quentin.

118
00:08:19.183 --> 00:08:22.085
Which I do not recommend. by the
way.

119
00:08:25.155 --> 00:08:26.423
Yo Pete. wait up.

120
00:08:26.457 --> 00:08:28.392
Hey. I wanna talk to you.

121
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:31.128
I'm sorry. I gotta get to
work.

122
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:32.996
I thought you just came from
work.

123
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:36.667
Oh. you're still working at that
bar?

124
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:39.136
No wonder you've been
missing meetings lately.

125
00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:42.372
Your PO know about this?

126
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.741
You know. he called me this
morning.

127
00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:47.311
asked about you and I
gotta tell him the truth.

128
00:08:47.344 --> 00:08:48.445
I get it. it's not your fault.

129
00:08:48.479 --> 00:08:50.681
If you gotta tell him the
truth. tell him the truth.

130
00:08:50.714 --> 00:08:53.250
I'm just letting you know I'm
just

131
00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:55.719
trying to make the fucking
rent this month. okay?

132
00:08:55.752 --> 00:08:57.654
You hang out in a
barber shop long enough.

133
00:08:57.688 --> 00:08:59.523
you're bound to get a haircut.
Pete.

134
00:09:01.058 --> 00:09:02.292
All right. you're right.

135
00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:07.397
Listen. I will give my notice
soon. okay?

136
00:09:09.132 --> 00:09:11.268
All right. man. You
do what you gotta do.

137
00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:37.628
- Hey. Fiona.
- Pete.

138
00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:39.129
What are you doing here?

139
00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:39.998
What do you mean what am I
doing here?

140
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:41.698
You know I always work the dead
shifts.

141
00:09:41.732 --> 00:09:43.734
Oh no. I didn't know that.

142
00:09:43.767 --> 00:09:46.570
I was actually pretty
slammed about an hour ago.

143
00:09:46.603 --> 00:09:48.105
Oh by the way. thank you

144
00:09:48.138 --> 00:09:50.374
so much for switching shifts
with me.

145
00:09:50.407 --> 00:09:52.476
I started teaching this
killer hot yoga class

146
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.379
on weeknights and Thursday's
my only free night.

147
00:09:55.412 --> 00:09:57.814
Oh my god. do you take hot yoga?

148
00:09:57.848 --> 00:09:58.715
You.

149
00:09:59.716 --> 00:10:01.418
nevermind.

150
00:10:01.451 --> 00:10:03.120
What?

151
00:10:03.153 --> 00:10:04.087
What the fuck?

152
00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:07.824
Todd. you got a mistake
here on the schedule.

153
00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:11.395
You've got Fiona on Thursday
nights. That's my night.

154
00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:14.097
No. no. no. she's
killing weeknights. man.

155
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:16.466
Yeah well ever since you
took weekends away from me.

156
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.336
Thursday night's my only
good night. it pays my bills.

157
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:22.773
There's a thing called
Facebook. Snapchat. Twitter.

158
00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:24.575
You know how to use those?

159
00:10:24.608 --> 00:10:26.777
Because I don't think you do.

160
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.546
Fiona on the other hand. she's
whip smart.

161
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.682
She's kicking ass and she's
promoting the hell out of us.

162
00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:32.916
It's like quadrupled our crowd.

163
00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.453
Now we're pouring $11 Moscow
mules out of copper cups. man.

164
00:10:36.486 --> 00:10:38.655
I do not want to go back to Bud
Light.

165
00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:39.556
Todd.

166
00:10:40.824 --> 00:10:42.759
I am social.

167
00:10:42.793 --> 00:10:45.162
You know me man. I keep
the drinks pouring.

168
00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:47.331
All right guys. I am closing
out here.

169
00:10:47.364 --> 00:10:51.201
Pete is going to take care of
you for the rest of the night.

170
00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.236
Aren't you rent-controlled
anyway?

171
00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:55.872
Yeah. for now.

172
00:10:55.906 --> 00:10:57.641
All right.

173
00:10:58.508 --> 00:10:59.676
Hey. I can do that.

174
00:11:07.317 --> 00:11:09.886
- Hi Susan.
- Are you on your way home?

175
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.955
Yeah.

176
00:11:10.989 --> 00:11:13.357
Ed and Karen
are coming over for dinner

177
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.259
tomorrow night and
apparently Ed doesn't do

178
00:11:16.293 --> 00:11:19.563
California wines and that's
all we have in the cellar.

179
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:22.599
All right. what kind do you
want?

180
00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:25.135
Why don't you
pick up a nice fresh zin?

181
00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:55.298
Hi there. can
I help you with something?

182
00:11:59.836 --> 00:12:01.571
You got a stain on your pants.

183
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.238
What's up. blood?

184
00:12:38.809 --> 00:12:40.410
Homeboy's staring.

185
00:12:41.745 --> 00:12:44.448
Do the test. right there. right
there.

186
00:14:12.003 --> 00:14:14.704
If you call the cops.
they ain't gonna do nothing.

187
00:14:18.441 --> 00:14:19.676
I ain't got nothing on me.

188
00:14:21.578 --> 00:14:24.048
They show up and rescue
me from beating your ass.

189
00:14:24.081 --> 00:14:28.418
I'll find you. I never
forget a face. you hear me?

190
00:14:28.451 --> 00:14:31.621
You square ass "Modern
Family" looking mother fucker.

191
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.624
Hey. you hear me?

192
00:14:48.139 --> 00:14:49.806
What the fuck. man?

193
00:14:50.841 --> 00:14:53.110
What's your fucking problem?

194
00:14:55.679 --> 00:14:56.613
No. no. no.

195
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.498
Motherfucking hella bubbly.
bitch.

196
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.935
Bam.

197
00:15:20.071 --> 00:15:20.937
Come on man.

198
00:15:22.505 --> 00:15:23.440
Are you over 21?

199
00:15:26.143 --> 00:15:28.912
Bitch. what you think?

200
00:15:28.945 --> 00:15:30.814
Yeah. I believe you.

201
00:15:31.781 --> 00:15:32.782
Why you celebrate?

202
00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:39.489
It's my lucky day.

203
00:15:39.522 --> 00:15:41.025
- You want box?
- No. I'm good.

204
00:15:45.729 --> 00:15:46.763
Excuse me.

205
00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:48.498
Fucking Old Navy motherfucker.

206
00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:58.175
Gee . that
paper from this morning.

207
00:15:58.209 --> 00:15:59.743
That old news by now.

208
00:15:59.776 --> 00:16:01.645
Yeah well. ever since I lost
my cable.

209
00:16:01.678 --> 00:16:03.747
that's the only entertainment I
have.

210
00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.448
It's free. take it.
Don't worry about it.

211
00:16:05.482 --> 00:16:07.784
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. yeah. take it.

212
00:16:07.817 --> 00:16:09.954
You don't have a smartphone.
huh?

213
00:16:09.987 --> 00:16:11.655
A smartphone? No.

214
00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:14.791
And I intend to keep it that
way.

215
00:16:14.824 --> 00:16:16.626
You have a good night Mr.
Wong. thanks for the paper.

216
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.495
Yeah. no problem. you too.

217
00:16:42.719 --> 00:16:44.587
Hey dad.
sorry. I tried calling

218
00:16:44.621 --> 00:16:46.756
you at work but I must've just
missed you.

219
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.659
Todd said he sent you home
early since it was slow.

220
00:16:49.693 --> 00:16:50.794
Anyway. just checking to make
sure

221
00:16:50.827 --> 00:16:54.031
you're still coming to Oakland
to see my show tomorrow.

222
00:16:54.065 --> 00:16:55.967
Also Sean wanted me to tell you

223
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.036
that he thinks you should sell
Big Blue.

224
00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.704
stop driving across the damn
bridge

225
00:17:00.737 --> 00:17:02.639
and just move to Oakland
with the rest of us.

226
00:17:02.672 --> 00:17:04.008
There's a few more things we
wanted

227
00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:07.577
to go over for the wedding. so
call me.

228
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.478
20. 30.

229
00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:10.647
50. 60.

230
00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:12.649
70.

231
00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.054
It was a shit night.

232
00:17:19.823 --> 00:17:21.993
Oh. what is he doing?

233
00:17:22.026 --> 00:17:24.095
Do it again. do it again.

234
00:17:54.191 --> 00:17:55.993
- Peter.
- Hey Ned.

235
00:17:57.194 --> 00:18:00.331
I thought best to tell you in
person.

236
00:18:00.364 --> 00:18:02.732
You're selling the building. I
heard.

237
00:18:02.766 --> 00:18:04.601
Actually the building's sold.

238
00:18:05.935 --> 00:18:06.770
Oh.

239
00:18:06.803 --> 00:18:10.673
So I wanted to drop by and
give you

240
00:18:10.707 --> 00:18:14.111
as much of a headstart as I
could.

241
00:18:14.145 --> 00:18:17.914
I know how hard it is to
find a new place to live.

242
00:18:17.947 --> 00:18:20.084
How soon are
we talking here. Ned?

243
00:18:21.218 --> 00:18:23.054
You got a place to go?

244
00:18:23.087 --> 00:18:25.022
Oh. you gotta be fucking
kidding me.

245
00:18:25.956 --> 00:18:28.125
No. I wish I were.
Peter.

246
00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:31.828
I'll have a relocation check for
you asap.

247
00:18:34.231 --> 00:18:36.067
Come on. baby.

248
00:18:37.268 --> 00:18:38.269
That a girl.

249
00:18:52.383 --> 00:18:56.087
♪ I'll always be there ♪

250
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.255
♪ For you ♪

251
00:19:01.258 --> 00:19:03.994
Thank you. thank you. thank you.

252
00:19:05.862 --> 00:19:06.930
Ladies and gentlemen.

253
00:19:06.964 --> 00:19:09.100
we have a very special
guest in the house tonight.

254
00:19:09.133 --> 00:19:11.168
He's an Oakland native
and he just so happens

255
00:19:11.202 --> 00:19:14.038
to be my dad all the
way from San Francisco.

256
00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:15.973
Dad. come on up here.

257
00:19:16.006 --> 00:19:19.909
Sore throat.

258
00:19:19.943 --> 00:19:21.278
So dad.

259
00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.315
What do you want?

260
00:19:24.348 --> 00:19:26.217
True confession. I
had an ulterior motive

261
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.419
for asking you to join
me on stage tonight.

262
00:19:28.452 --> 00:19:30.287
Not just to embarrass your
father?

263
00:19:32.089 --> 00:19:32.856
I'd really like it if you

264
00:19:32.889 --> 00:19:34.891
sang a duet with me at the
wedding.

265
00:19:35.892 --> 00:19:38.162
What. what are you. crazy?

266
00:19:38.195 --> 00:19:40.998
No. it's not crazy. It'll be
amazing.

267
00:19:41.031 --> 00:19:44.068
I don't know. it's 150 people.

268
00:19:44.101 --> 00:19:47.404
And I'll never ask for
anything from you ever again.

269
00:19:47.438 --> 00:19:49.006
We'll rehearse twice a week.

270
00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:50.441
I don't know. I haven't done

271
00:19:50.474 --> 00:19:54.744
anything like this in a
long time. ever since-

272
00:19:54.777 --> 00:19:56.180
- She would want you to do it.

273
00:20:00.917 --> 00:20:02.685
Ah Jesus. okay.

274
00:20:02.719 --> 00:20:03.387
Really?

275
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.022
Yes. but I'm not gonna dance.

276
00:20:05.055 --> 00:20:05.855
Fine but you're still coming

277
00:20:05.889 --> 00:20:06.789
to the party tomorrow night.
right?

278
00:20:06.823 --> 00:20:10.027
Oh. you mean the
pre-wedding party party?

279
00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.694
Yes. that's the party.

280
00:20:11.728 --> 00:20:12.762
All of my friends are gonna be
there.

281
00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:14.431
They haven't seen you in years.

282
00:20:14.465 --> 00:20:16.900
I wouldn't miss it for the
world.

283
00:20:16.933 --> 00:20:20.271
Nice. I'm dancing like a goddamn
jabberwocky at the party.

284
00:20:20.304 --> 00:20:23.307
That's exactly why I'm gonna
leave the dancing to you.

285
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.908
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

286
00:20:24.941 --> 00:20:26.243
To having a good time.

287
00:20:28.012 --> 00:20:29.779
So my offer still stands.

288
00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:31.948
If you want it to be a
surprise for Natalie.

289
00:20:31.982 --> 00:20:34.018
I could teach you to dance.

290
00:20:34.051 --> 00:20:36.753
For real. no look. I don't
know if you know this but

291
00:20:37.854 --> 00:20:40.924
you're white and so you may need
my help.

292
00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:42.892
I think I'll pass. okay?

293
00:20:42.926 --> 00:20:43.826
But hey. listen.

294
00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:47.264
On a more serious note.

295
00:20:47.298 --> 00:20:49.799
I didn't want to say
anything in front of Natalie.

296
00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.203
You're not dying. are you?

297
00:20:52.236 --> 00:20:54.305
Dying. what? No.

298
00:20:54.338 --> 00:20:57.208
Fuck no. what the fuck? No. I'm
not dying.

299
00:20:57.241 --> 00:20:58.808
You can't hit me with that
heavy shit.

300
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:00.044
Ah shit dude. no.

301
00:21:00.077 --> 00:21:02.812
I saved up some money. I want
to give you guys some money.

302
00:21:02.845 --> 00:21:05.049
Oh no. no. no. no. no. no.

303
00:21:05.082 --> 00:21:06.950
My parents got this. bro.

304
00:21:06.984 --> 00:21:08.252
Natalie didn't tell you?

305
00:21:08.285 --> 00:21:10.521
Look okay. I know traditionally
the father

306
00:21:10.554 --> 00:21:14.124
- of the bride is supposed to-
- Go on.

307
00:21:15.858 --> 00:21:16.759
Pete.

308
00:21:16.793 --> 00:21:19.496
Hey look. your parents are
great. okay?

309
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.765
It's just ever since I got
back in Natalie's life.

310
00:21:22.799 --> 00:21:24.235
it's been really hard to do that

311
00:21:24.268 --> 00:21:27.238
and I owe her so much. I owe you
so much.

312
00:21:27.271 --> 00:21:30.007
I'm gonna owe you when
I get older even more.

313
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.977
No man look. we love
you bro. we love you.

314
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.511
- Come on. man.
- I appreciate that.

315
00:21:34.545 --> 00:21:35.613
But I want you to take this
money

316
00:21:35.646 --> 00:21:38.415
and maybe use it for a
honeymoon or whatever. okay?

317
00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:42.453
All right.

318
00:21:42.486 --> 00:21:43.820
Thanks man.

319
00:21:43.853 --> 00:21:45.888
I really wish you still drank.
bro.

320
00:21:47.157 --> 00:21:48.325
- Oh no. you don't.
- What?

321
00:21:48.359 --> 00:21:49.960
No. you don't.

322
00:21:49.994 --> 00:21:51.128
I could drink you under the
table.

323
00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:55.199
I'm sure you could but I'm
gonna tell you right now.

324
00:21:55.232 --> 00:21:57.301
you don't even wanna see me try.

325
00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.138
- All right.
- Thanks. Pete.

326
00:22:11.048 --> 00:22:13.217
A gruesome discovery
has people in this quiet

327
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.452
San Francisco neighborhood
feeling a bit uneasy.

328
00:22:15.486 --> 00:22:17.887
Are you with me?

329
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.888
Oh. Harry.

330
00:22:18.921 --> 00:22:19.957
Police
were called to an alley

331
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.559
off 40th Street at around
5:00 a.m. this morning-

332
00:22:22.593 --> 00:22:25.162
- Oh come on. Harry.
- Discovered a body-

333
00:22:25.195 --> 00:22:26.463
- Hey. you're the one that set

334
00:22:26.497 --> 00:22:28.599
the quota for three times a
week. not me.

335
00:22:28.632 --> 00:22:31.402
33 year old
Frederick Ross of Oakland.

336
00:22:31.435 --> 00:22:34.238
- I thought it was four?
- Help out our investigators.

337
00:22:34.271 --> 00:22:37.174
please do contact the San
Francisco Police Department.

338
00:22:38.575 --> 00:22:42.346
I know we are going through a
drought

339
00:22:42.379 --> 00:22:45.915
but I feel like too bad. I am
gonna take

340
00:22:45.948 --> 00:22:48.818
a 20 minute shower and
I don't give a shit.

341
00:22:50.321 --> 00:22:53.357
The environmentalists can suck
my dick.

342
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:57.894
So talking about politics.
I think tomorrow the editor-

343
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.098
- Yeah. okay.

344
00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:16.080
If Philip from
the Valley can't help

345
00:23:16.113 --> 00:23:19.216
end gun violence. I don't know
who can.

346
00:23:19.249 --> 00:23:21.151
We can do anything we want.

347
00:23:45.142 --> 00:23:48.512
I said "Of course it's
quiet. it's a fucking Tesla."

348
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.192
This is a damn good zin.

349
00:24:04.261 --> 00:24:05.629
Where'd you say you got it from
again?

350
00:24:05.662 --> 00:24:07.264
- France.
- Yes.

351
00:24:07.297 --> 00:24:09.166
That's the last bottle right
there.

352
00:24:09.199 --> 00:24:10.401
Oh no.

353
00:24:10.434 --> 00:24:12.536
You're just going to have
to drink a little slower. Ed.

354
00:24:12.569 --> 00:24:15.038
Maybe that way you can actually
savor it.

355
00:24:18.142 --> 00:24:20.677
♪ Let it be the thing that I am ♪

356
00:24:20.711 --> 00:24:22.179
Honey.

357
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.282
Please unplug. we have company.

358
00:24:25.315 --> 00:24:28.419
That's okay. that is the
society we live in now.

359
00:24:28.452 --> 00:24:31.688
We all have to update
our status at all times.

360
00:24:31.722 --> 00:24:33.724
Well. Harold
doesn't do social media.

361
00:24:33.757 --> 00:24:35.259
That's 'cause he's a
grownup.

362
00:24:35.292 --> 00:24:38.095
Shut up Ed. you have a
Facebook and a Twitter page.

363
00:24:40.597 --> 00:24:42.299
So why don't you do social
media?

364
00:24:45.536 --> 00:24:47.971
I think it brings out
the worst in humanity.

365
00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:50.240
How so?

366
00:24:50.274 --> 00:24:51.975
It makes everyone think
they're special

367
00:24:52.009 --> 00:24:54.445
but deep down. everyone's just a
troll.

368
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.149
That's why people on the
internet love anonymity because

369
00:24:59.183 --> 00:25:02.085
they can finally feel free
to say whatever they want.

370
00:25:04.254 --> 00:25:05.456
- It's kinda like guns.
- Harry.

371
00:25:05.489 --> 00:25:09.159
Guns and trolls. wow.
this zin is incredible.

372
00:25:10.394 --> 00:25:12.629
It's taking us down a rabbit
hole.

373
00:25:14.765 --> 00:25:17.367
People don't carry guns for
protection.

374
00:25:18.635 --> 00:25:21.205
What they really want is for
someone

375
00:25:21.238 --> 00:25:23.240
to give them the excuse to use
it.

376
00:25:24.775 --> 00:25:28.111
Go on. burglarize my house.
Let's see what happens.

377
00:25:29.079 --> 00:25:30.714
Snatch my purse.

378
00:25:31.682 --> 00:25:33.450
You make them pay the ultimate
price

379
00:25:33.484 --> 00:25:35.686
just for fucking with the wrong
person.

380
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.189
That is everyone's fantasy.
right?

381
00:25:42.593 --> 00:25:44.495
Tell us how you really feel.
honey.

382
00:25:46.763 --> 00:25:49.466
You know. I want to propose a
toast.

383
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.471
To your Foundation from Silicon
Valley to Washington DC.

384
00:25:55.839 --> 00:25:57.641
sensible gun law change is
coming

385
00:25:57.674 --> 00:26:01.178
and it's all because of your
generosity.

386
00:26:02.479 --> 00:26:03.447
At the end of the day. we all

387
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.183
just want the world to
be a safer place. right?

388
00:26:06.216 --> 00:26:09.419
Cheers.

389
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.127
Sorry.

390
00:26:19.763 --> 00:26:20.631
Hello?

391
00:26:21.632 --> 00:26:23.066
Honey.

392
00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.201
Mind if I just check my phone?

393
00:26:26.303 --> 00:26:29.806
- I have to take this.
- Please don't be long.

394
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.874
I am sorry.

395
00:26:30.908 --> 00:26:32.809
And my last
question. what is your name?

396
00:26:32.843 --> 00:26:36.547
Harold Price. June 23rd. 1963.

397
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:37.614
And do any of the
charges

398
00:26:37.648 --> 00:26:39.416
look suspicious to you or
are they all occurring-

399
00:26:39.449 --> 00:26:41.785
- No. all of those charges are
correct.

400
00:26:41.818 --> 00:26:42.853
Okay. thank you sir

401
00:26:42.886 --> 00:26:44.187
and your other account looks
correct?

402
00:26:44.221 --> 00:26:45.689
- Yes. both accounts.
- Okay. great.

403
00:26:45.722 --> 00:26:47.157
- So nothing looks suspicious?
- No.

404
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.525
Everything seems normal.

405
00:26:49.459 --> 00:26:51.562
Is there anything
else we can help you with?

406
00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:53.397
No thank you.

407
00:27:21.458 --> 00:27:24.795
Harold. come
on. we're ready to eat.

408
00:27:26.196 --> 00:27:27.331
Where are you?

409
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.868
Harold. you're embarrassing me.

410
00:27:31.902 --> 00:27:32.736
Sweetheart. can you

411
00:27:32.769 --> 00:27:35.405
just apologize to Ed and Karen
for me?

412
00:27:35.439 --> 00:27:37.374
Is that the garage
door?

413
00:27:37.407 --> 00:27:39.443
Where are you going? We have
company.

414
00:27:39.476 --> 00:27:42.346
- I told you to be back soon.
- Honey. I'm sorry.

415
00:27:42.379 --> 00:27:44.448
I had to get to the office.

416
00:27:44.481 --> 00:27:47.351
Just please keep our guests
happy.

417
00:27:47.384 --> 00:27:49.386
Keep the wine flowing.

418
00:27:49.419 --> 00:27:51.722
What am I
supposed to do here by mys-

419
00:28:16.747 --> 00:28:18.181
- Credit?
- Yeah.

420
00:28:18.215 --> 00:28:19.816
Chip card. just
insert.

421
00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:21.885
You don't check ID?

422
00:28:25.957 --> 00:28:28.792
You have gray hair.
you're over 21 I think.

423
00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:41.638
Have a good night.

424
00:28:49.613 --> 00:28:51.648
That your security camera?

425
00:28:51.682 --> 00:28:52.549
Why?

426
00:28:57.354 --> 00:28:59.623
Where do you
keep the recordings to that?

427
00:29:42.733 --> 00:29:43.533
I'm Cinnamon.

428
00:29:43.567 --> 00:29:45.268
this is Crystal. What's your
name?

429
00:29:46.503 --> 00:29:47.437
Harold.

430
00:29:49.773 --> 00:29:52.809
- I am so fucking wasted.
- Fuck yeah. you are.

431
00:29:54.644 --> 00:29:56.613
- Boo yah.
- How'd you get that-

432
00:29:56.646 --> 00:29:58.281
- Shh.

433
00:29:58.315 --> 00:30:01.485
- You're so odd.
- Don't trip. baby.

434
00:30:01.518 --> 00:30:02.786
Harold ain't got no limits.

435
00:30:04.454 --> 00:30:05.422
You know what I'm saying?

436
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:08.258
Come here. girl.

437
00:30:19.803 --> 00:30:21.239
Piece of shit.

438
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:33.416
Hey box boy.

439
00:30:34.818 --> 00:30:37.821
how about you show me what
they charge in prison?

440
00:30:37.854 --> 00:30:39.790
What are you doing here?

441
00:30:39.823 --> 00:30:40.690
You thirsty?

442
00:30:41.691 --> 00:30:42.526
So a guy gets beat

443
00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:44.761
to death with brass knuckles. so
what?

444
00:30:46.063 --> 00:30:48.532
So what? Nobody uses brass
knuckles.

445
00:30:48.565 --> 00:30:51.568
Well. almost nobody.

446
00:30:51.601 --> 00:30:53.436
It doesn't mean it's the same
guy.

447
00:30:55.438 --> 00:30:56.406
I don't believe this.

448
00:30:56.439 --> 00:30:58.075
If I gave you this
information six years ago.

449
00:30:58.109 --> 00:30:59.943
you would've gone batshit crazy.

450
00:30:59.977 --> 00:31:02.612
Yeah well. two years in
prison will do that to do.

451
00:31:02.646 --> 00:31:03.680
Do what?

452
00:31:03.713 --> 00:31:05.049
Make you think twice about
doing

453
00:31:05.082 --> 00:31:08.085
something stupid. like listening
to you.

454
00:31:09.987 --> 00:31:11.922
That's not the only
thing you did in prison.

455
00:31:12.823 --> 00:31:14.891
You hit that commissary every
night. huh?

456
00:31:14.925 --> 00:31:17.828
What'd they give you. your
last meal every fucking night?

457
00:31:17.861 --> 00:31:18.963
Suck my dick. Jack.

458
00:31:18.996 --> 00:31:21.631
I know I'm a fat fuck. okay?

459
00:31:21.665 --> 00:31:23.000
You and Catherine still in
Petaluma?

460
00:31:23.034 --> 00:31:24.001
Oh yeah.

461
00:31:24.868 --> 00:31:26.837
God. it's great.

462
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:29.606
Do you want to know what
the highlight of my day is?

463
00:31:29.639 --> 00:31:32.943
I wake up every morning and I
don't get

464
00:31:32.977 --> 00:31:35.478
a blow job from my wife and I
usually take

465
00:31:35.512 --> 00:31:38.515
a shit about the size of
the Transamerica Pyramid.

466
00:31:39.683 --> 00:31:42.452
But the highlight of my day
is I go down to my local

467
00:31:42.485 --> 00:31:46.723
Starbucks and I watch my
favorite barista frappe my 'cino

468
00:31:46.756 --> 00:31:50.927
and when she's doing it. I
just grab a little glimpse

469
00:31:51.828 --> 00:31:55.532
of her perfect apple ass
and then everything else

470
00:31:55.565 --> 00:31:58.835
goes downhill from there
because that's what fucking

471
00:31:58.869 --> 00:32:01.771
happens when they give you
early fucking retirement.

472
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.609
I gotta tell ya. Pete.

473
00:32:05.642 --> 00:32:08.645
there's not a day that
goes by that I don't think

474
00:32:08.678 --> 00:32:11.481
I wonder if this is the
day I'm gonna take my Glock

475
00:32:11.514 --> 00:32:13.783
and blow my fucking
brains out from boredom.

476
00:32:15.987 --> 00:32:18.022
Jack. what are you doing here?

477
00:32:18.055 --> 00:32:20.124
Obviously I don't have
any money to give you.

478
00:32:20.157 --> 00:32:22.093
I mean you're wasting your time.

479
00:32:22.126 --> 00:32:23.460
Money?

480
00:32:23.493 --> 00:32:26.529
Pete. if I wanted money. I
wouldn't be

481
00:32:26.563 --> 00:32:29.466
looking for clients next
to a dumpster. no offense.

482
00:32:31.668 --> 00:32:33.670
I still have connections in the
LPD.

483
00:32:35.505 --> 00:32:36.773
What's that?

484
00:32:36.806 --> 00:32:39.643
That is a list of Fred
Ross' known associates.

485
00:32:40.978 --> 00:32:42.846
Who the fuck is Fred Ross?

486
00:32:42.879 --> 00:32:45.016
Who the fuck is Fred Ross?

487
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:47.517
The drug dealer who got
his head bashed in with

488
00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.687
brass knuckles. now maybe
the murder was personal.

489
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.957
Maybe someone on this
list is your guy. Pete.

490
00:32:54.091 --> 00:32:56.994
Why would he resurface 25
years later?

491
00:32:58.628 --> 00:32:59.729
Do you watch the news?

492
00:32:59.763 --> 00:33:01.798
Are you watching what's
happening in the world today?

493
00:33:01.831 --> 00:33:03.200
Everybody hates everybody. Pete.

494
00:33:03.234 --> 00:33:04.668
Everybody's mad about
everything.

495
00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:07.671
There's road rage and Twitter
wars.

496
00:33:07.704 --> 00:33:10.640
It's not hunky-dory like
it used to be. it's not.

497
00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:16.813
And beyond that. this is for
Sharry.

498
00:33:16.846 --> 00:33:18.581
Now you said she deserved this.

499
00:33:18.615 --> 00:33:21.785
This mother fucker
deserves the death penalty

500
00:33:21.818 --> 00:33:23.187
and we're gonna give it to him.

501
00:33:24.155 --> 00:33:25.622
Just like last time. huh?

502
00:33:26.756 --> 00:33:28.225
Okay.

503
00:33:28.259 --> 00:33:30.727
you accidentally sent the wrong
guy

504
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.562
into a coma for a couple days.

505
00:33:32.595 --> 00:33:33.830
Five days. Jack.

506
00:33:33.863 --> 00:33:37.034
Five days he was in a coma but
you want to go ahead and tell

507
00:33:37.068 --> 00:33:40.704
yourself that so you can sleep
at night. fine. kudos to you.

508
00:33:40.737 --> 00:33:42.073
For me. it wasn't worth it.

509
00:33:43.873 --> 00:33:44.841
It got you sober.

510
00:33:45.809 --> 00:33:48.045
Don't give me that
silver lining bullshit.

511
00:33:52.649 --> 00:33:53.883
Hey.

512
00:33:53.917 --> 00:33:54.784
hey.

513
00:33:55.885 --> 00:33:58.555
Natalie's getting married in a
month.

514
00:33:58.588 --> 00:33:59.256
No shit.

515
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:02.859
I'll bet I wasn't invited.
I'll send a toaster.

516
00:34:04.627 --> 00:34:06.063
I'm sorry Pete. I don't know why

517
00:34:06.097 --> 00:34:08.732
I'm being a fucking asshole.
especially about that.

518
00:34:09.766 --> 00:34:12.702
I'll bet she's beautiful
just like her mom. huh?

519
00:34:12.736 --> 00:34:14.972
Please give her my
congratulations all around.

520
00:34:16.573 --> 00:34:17.807
Yeah okay. thanks.

521
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:23.147
Hey listen. you know. I
should be going anyway.

522
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:24.048
Hey.

523
00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:28.152
Even a broken clock is right

Pete.

525
00:34:35.658 --> 00:34:36.726

531
00:35:52.702 --> 00:35:55.239
Thanks. I've got tapes for sale.

Buy me a beer and I'll
give you a discount.

533
00:35:58.309 --> 00:36:01.845
This is about as dead as
I've ever seen in this place.

534
00:36:01.878 --> 00:36:03.314
Look at this fucking place.

535
00:36:03.347 --> 00:36:05.282
Next week man. better
flyers.

536
00:36:05.316 --> 00:36:07.151
There's not gonna be a next
week.

537
00:36:46.123 --> 00:36:50.027
- It's just a check.
- Just a check for 15 G's.

538
00:36:51.928 --> 00:36:52.963
Kicking you out. huh?

539
00:36:54.031 --> 00:36:55.832
Yeah.

540
00:36:55.865 --> 00:36:57.334
Man. like I said.
you're more

541
00:36:57.368 --> 00:36:59.336
than welcome to stay with
Natalie and I.

542
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:00.204
They're gonna have to
drag

543
00:37:00.237 --> 00:37:02.072
me outta here kicking and
screaming.

544
00:37:03.374 --> 00:37:04.908
You know what?

545
00:37:04.941 --> 00:37:05.775
Maybe you should talk to Natalie

546
00:37:05.808 --> 00:37:08.045
before you think about moving in
with us.

547
00:37:16.487 --> 00:37:20.924
At first. I didn't even know
it was him.

548
00:37:20.958 --> 00:37:23.360
Almost nothing left of his face.

549
00:37:24.395 --> 00:37:27.864
As I said. it was something
metal that killed him

550
00:37:27.897 --> 00:37:31.168
like brass knuckles or
something like that.

551
00:37:32.503 --> 00:37:37.107
He lived in San Francisco
for his whole life and

552
00:37:38.942 --> 00:37:40.843
he work here for 40 years.

553
00:37:45.382 --> 00:37:46.716
Who would do this?

554
00:37:49.286 --> 00:37:51.522
A drug dealer. an
Asian liquor store owner.

555
00:37:51.555 --> 00:37:52.990
The only thing these two guys
have

556
00:37:53.023 --> 00:37:56.327
in common is somebody
smashed in their faces.

557
00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.962
I don't know. it might be
nothing

558
00:37:57.995 --> 00:37:59.896
but Mr. Wong's nephew said-

559
00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:02.032
- There's no security
footage at all. you know why?

560
00:38:02.066 --> 00:38:04.834
The son of a bitch stole
the security cameras.

561
00:38:04.867 --> 00:38:07.104
It's all gone. It's a
dead end for us. buddy.

562
00:38:08.005 --> 00:38:08.871
Thanks.

563
00:38:11.408 --> 00:38:12.276
Ah. fuck it.

564
00:38:34.298 --> 00:38:38.002
Hey Harry. can I get the email
addresses

565
00:38:38.035 --> 00:38:40.304
of the donors we're meeting this
weekend?

566
00:38:40.337 --> 00:38:43.140
I called but the guy's wife is
real judgy.

567
00:38:43.173 --> 00:38:46.543
You know. one of those artsy
trophy wives.

568
00:38:46.577 --> 00:38:49.280
- Phil?
- Yeah. Phil.

569
00:38:49.313 --> 00:38:51.415
She's probably bitter that she
couldn't

570
00:38:51.448 --> 00:38:55.286
put that $200.000 arts degree to
use.

571
00:38:55.319 --> 00:38:57.288
It reminds me how grateful I am

572
00:38:57.321 --> 00:38:59.189
that I transferred over to
marketing.

573
00:39:00.291 --> 00:39:02.859
You definitely dodged that
bullet.

574
00:39:17.474 --> 00:39:19.543
I thought you said you didn't
like anal.

575
00:39:21.979 --> 00:39:23.347
What are you talking about?

576
00:39:29.186 --> 00:39:32.489
The charges on your credit
card. Harry. I saw them.

577
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:35.359
Porn and strippers. really?

578
00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.860
It was a bachelor party.

579
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.231
Sure it was.

580
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.601
We're starting therapy again.

581
00:39:45.569 --> 00:39:48.072
I'm calling Dr. Berberich
first thing in the morning.

582
00:39:48.105 --> 00:39:49.406
That's really not necessary.

583
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.341
Yes. it is.

584
00:39:50.374 --> 00:39:52.909
You know. if I could strap a GPS

585
00:39:52.942 --> 00:39:54.511
to your dick. I would do that
too.

586
00:40:17.968 --> 00:40:20.104
How soon are you looking to
move?

587
00:40:20.137 --> 00:40:21.004
Soon.

588
00:40:22.039 --> 00:40:22.905
Yeah. real soon.

589
00:40:25.976 --> 00:40:28.145
So on the phone. you said it was
1650.

590
00:40:28.178 --> 00:40:29.680
Is there any wiggle room in
there?

591
00:40:29.713 --> 00:40:31.115
2650.

592
00:40:32.416 --> 00:40:33.083
Jesus.

593
00:40:33.117 --> 00:40:35.452
- What's the deposit?
- 3500.

594
00:40:38.155 --> 00:40:41.091
So you want 6150 to move in
here?

595
00:40:41.125 --> 00:40:45.129
It's a remodel. notice
the granite countertop?

596
00:40:47.097 --> 00:40:47.965
Yeah.

597
00:40:50.734 --> 00:40:52.136
I'll be in touch.

598
00:40:54.004 --> 00:40:55.973
- Want an application?
- Suck my dick.

599
00:41:06.717 --> 00:41:08.685
I would totally pick you
up but people are gonna

600
00:41:08.719 --> 00:41:11.321
start arriving any minute and
I'm not done cleaning yet.

601
00:41:11.355 --> 00:41:12.289
Sean doesn't get home 'til 5:30.

602
00:41:12.322 --> 00:41:14.358
Yeah no. listen. I'll just
take the bus.

603
00:41:14.391 --> 00:41:16.960
No. no. no. no. no.
no. That's ridiculous.

604
00:41:16.994 --> 00:41:18.729
I'm gonna call you an Uber.

605
00:41:18.762 --> 00:41:20.564
Oh honey. don't waste your
money.

606
00:41:21.598 --> 00:41:23.500
Too late. the driver is en
route.

607
00:41:23.534 --> 00:41:26.203
His name is Trevor.
he's in a silver Prius.

608
00:41:26.236 --> 00:41:27.438
Really. that's it?

609
00:41:27.471 --> 00:41:30.174
That's it. welcome to the 21st
century.

610
00:41:30.207 --> 00:41:31.675
I have a feeling you're gonna be
hooked.

611
00:41:38.148 --> 00:41:39.016
Yo.

612
00:41:46.356 --> 00:41:47.224
Trevor?

613
00:41:50.427 --> 00:41:54.598
Anyway. so here I am about
to be officially homeless.

614
00:41:55.532 --> 00:41:58.135
Not even Oakland is affordable
anymore.

615
00:41:58.168 --> 00:41:59.770
I'm gonna have to ask my
daughter

616
00:41:59.803 --> 00:42:02.673
if I can crash at her place for
awhile.

617
00:42:02.706 --> 00:42:04.508
So is that what they
call gentrification?

618
00:42:06.243 --> 00:42:09.346
Urban renewal. racial
dislocation.

619
00:42:09.379 --> 00:42:11.348
I thought that shit only
happened to black people. man.

620
00:42:11.381 --> 00:42:12.549
That's shit's crazy.

621
00:42:12.583 --> 00:42:15.385
Yeah well. my bills
don't see color apparently.

622
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.188
- That's rough.
- What about you?

623
00:42:18.222 --> 00:42:19.490
What's your story?

624
00:42:20.491 --> 00:42:23.160
Born and raised in
Oakland just like you.

625
00:42:23.193 --> 00:42:26.096
except if I came up in the
public housing zone. you know?

626
00:42:26.129 --> 00:42:28.232
Same as any other ghetto though.
you know what I'm saying?

627
00:42:28.265 --> 00:42:31.668
Crime. crack. drugs.
prostitution.

628
00:42:31.702 --> 00:42:33.470
all out in the open and shit.
man.

629
00:42:34.538 --> 00:42:35.706
I was like this ain't no way to
live. man.

630
00:42:35.739 --> 00:42:40.077
so I got my act together. got
me a little degree online.

631
00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:42.145
I'm just doing this little
driving thing right now. man.

632
00:42:42.179 --> 00:42:45.148
You know. just trying to pay
back these student loans.

633
00:42:45.182 --> 00:42:46.216
I'm just grinding. man.

634
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:48.051
You and me both. huh?

635
00:42:49.453 --> 00:42:50.320
I'll tell you.

636
00:42:51.822 --> 00:42:54.791
a lot of people out there
got it easy compared us.

637
00:42:54.825 --> 00:42:55.626
You know what I'm saying?

638
00:42:55.659 --> 00:42:57.394
That's one way to look at it.
man.

639
00:42:57.427 --> 00:43:00.097
but you know. it's about
perspective though.

640
00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.266
Remember what Teddy Roosevelt
said. right?

641
00:43:02.299 --> 00:43:04.067
No. what'd he say?

642
00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:07.170
He said "Comparison is the thief
of joy."

643
00:43:08.505 --> 00:43:09.373
Right?

644
00:43:11.174 --> 00:43:13.210
That's some motivational therapy
for you.

645
00:43:14.278 --> 00:43:15.479
Hey man. you ain't got nowhere
to be.

646
00:43:15.512 --> 00:43:16.713
I mean like right this second.
right?

647
00:43:16.747 --> 00:43:18.649
You mind if I pick up my
cousin right quick. man?

648
00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:20.751
He gonna be coming up
over here on the right.

649
00:43:22.386 --> 00:43:24.154
- Yeah sure. I guess.
- Right on. man.

650
00:43:24.187 --> 00:43:25.155
Appreciate it. man.

651
00:43:41.471 --> 00:43:42.472
Do you mind?

652
00:43:54.885 --> 00:43:56.353
Hey. hey. hey.

653
00:43:57.888 --> 00:44:03.093
This isn't the way.

654
00:44:03.493 --> 00:44:04.361
Oh shit.

655
00:44:07.564 --> 00:44:10.200
Target's
gonna be a black male.

656
00:44:10.233 --> 00:44:12.502
- 30. gray hoodie.
- Damn boy.

657
00:44:12.536 --> 00:44:14.204
Under a flannel.

658
00:44:14.237 --> 00:44:15.639
I ain't no diamond tester but

659
00:44:18.575 --> 00:44:20.777
to me man. that shit look
realer than a motherfucker.

660
00:44:23.513 --> 00:44:24.481
What the fuck you rolling around

661
00:44:24.514 --> 00:44:26.383
with a diamond ring in
your pocket for. Pete?

662
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:30.854
It's my wife's. she's dead.

663
00:44:32.623 --> 00:44:35.258
She won't me missing it then.
huh?

664
00:44:36.793 --> 00:44:41.264
Asshole.

665
00:44:41.298 --> 00:44:43.500
Are you serious right
now? Everything's about you.

666
00:44:43.533 --> 00:44:45.636
We just went to your fucking one
man show.

667
00:44:45.669 --> 00:44:47.671
You don't wanna
go. you don't have to go.

668
00:44:47.704 --> 00:44:51.308
- No. that's not what I mean.
- No. fuck it.

669
00:44:53.276 --> 00:44:56.413
What are you?

670
00:44:56.446 --> 00:44:57.381
I thought you quit.

671
00:45:02.419 --> 00:45:04.287
Slow down. please.

672
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:06.490
You know I hate it when
you drive like that.

673
00:45:06.523 --> 00:45:08.525
Get off that car's back.

674
00:45:10.527 --> 00:45:11.963
It's just a cigarette.
Jesus.

675
00:45:11.996 --> 00:45:14.331
No. it's not just a
cigarette.

676
00:45:14.364 --> 00:45:16.733
Why don't you just grow the fuck
up?

677
00:45:16.767 --> 00:45:18.702
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

678
00:45:18.735 --> 00:45:20.937
I don't know. behave like a
fucking man

679
00:45:20.972 --> 00:45:23.707
and not feel like such a
victim all the fucking time.

680
00:45:24.775 --> 00:45:25.876
What are you?

681
00:45:25.909 --> 00:45:26.777
Pete.

682
00:45:29.746 --> 00:45:32.449
What are you doing?

683
00:45:32.482 --> 00:45:34.951
Look. just take the
baby home.

684
00:45:34.986 --> 00:45:37.220
I am sick and tired of being

685
00:45:37.254 --> 00:45:39.690
strung along in your life dream.

686
00:45:42.526 --> 00:45:43.460
What about my life?

687
00:45:46.797 --> 00:45:47.664
I'm done.

688
00:45:54.738 --> 00:45:57.741
Man. get him the fuck up out
this car and let's roll. man.

689
00:45:59.609 --> 00:46:01.445
Make that nigga seasick while
you at it.

690
00:46:01.478 --> 00:46:06.483
Get your fat ass out the car.

691
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:09.720
You ain't got no more
money tucked. do you?

692
00:46:09.753 --> 00:46:10.654
What's this?

693
00:46:12.489 --> 00:46:14.891
- Speak up. fool.
- What it looks like.

694
00:46:16.326 --> 00:46:18.595
- Are you a cop. Pete?
- A cop?

695
00:46:18.628 --> 00:46:19.529
Far from it.

696
00:46:21.032 --> 00:46:22.967
Cuz. check this out bro.

697
00:46:31.808 --> 00:46:32.709
If you ain't no cop.

698
00:46:32.743 --> 00:46:34.878
what you're doing with these
files. Pete?

699
00:46:34.911 --> 00:46:37.347
Trying to find the
guy that killed my wife.

700
00:46:38.782 --> 00:46:39.683
And you think one of the names
here

701
00:46:39.716 --> 00:46:41.885
is the person that killed your
wife. huh?

702
00:46:41.918 --> 00:46:42.886
Probably not.

703
00:46:44.454 --> 00:46:47.724
But maybe one of those guys know
who did.

704
00:46:47.758 --> 00:46:50.894
What if I told you I know
one of the names on here?

705
00:46:50.927 --> 00:46:52.997
What if I told you I
might be able to help you?

706
00:46:54.098 --> 00:46:55.899
I'd say you've got my
attention.

707
00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.502
Yeah. but what you got for me?

708
00:47:00.972 --> 00:47:01.838
Pete.

709
00:47:02.739 --> 00:47:03.673
come on. man.

710
00:47:05.342 --> 00:47:07.511
You rolling around with diamond
rings.

711
00:47:07.544 --> 00:47:09.746
envelopes full of cash and shit.

712
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.548
I'm sure you got something more.
man.

713
00:47:13.483 --> 00:47:14.584
I got a Volvo.

714
00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:16.954
You know how to drive stick?

715
00:47:26.696 --> 00:47:29.499
This whip is perfect.
ain't it?

716
00:47:29.533 --> 00:47:30.400
For what?

717
00:47:32.103 --> 00:47:34.071
Man. when are you gonna
introduce me to your friend?

718
00:47:34.105 --> 00:47:35.639
Didn't I say I would do it?

719
00:47:37.641 --> 00:47:38.842
Let me ask you something.

720
00:47:39.943 --> 00:47:41.745
You ever wore glasses before.
Pete?

721
00:47:48.618 --> 00:47:49.287
Man. what's up. man?

722
00:47:49.319 --> 00:47:50.121
That nigga's truck right there.

723
00:47:50.154 --> 00:47:52.656
What's up with this fool Sherm.
man?

724
00:47:52.689 --> 00:47:54.992
I don't know. he probably
up there catching VD.

725
00:47:55.026 --> 00:47:58.895
I assume this Sherm is one
of the names on our list?

726
00:47:58.929 --> 00:47:59.997
You gonna have to season them

727
00:48:00.031 --> 00:48:01.832
questions a little bit more
moderately. you feel me?

728
00:48:01.865 --> 00:48:03.366
Sherm get in this car
and you start asking him

729
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.501
all them questions. man. he
gonna think

730
00:48:04.534 --> 00:48:05.569
you some kinda narc or
something. man.

731
00:48:05.602 --> 00:48:06.570
He ain't gonna tell you shit.

732
00:48:06.603 --> 00:48:09.372
Not to mentioned it
might get you capped.

733
00:48:09.406 --> 00:48:10.074
And that shit's real.

734
00:48:10.107 --> 00:48:11.741
And what exactly is this job?

735
00:48:11.775 --> 00:48:13.410
Don't trip. all right?

736
00:48:13.443 --> 00:48:16.546
It's just some petty
larceny. that's all we doing.

737
00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.849
I'm gonna ask you to
drive the Bronco for me.

738
00:48:18.882 --> 00:48:21.484
Doesn't sound like part
of the original deal to me.

739
00:48:24.721 --> 00:48:26.790
Is this all part of the Prius
gammick too?

740
00:48:28.758 --> 00:48:31.528
- This music.
- What about it?

741
00:48:31.561 --> 00:48:35.166
It doesn't really seem
like you'd be. you know.

742
00:48:35.199 --> 00:48:38.468
the type of fucking guy that
would listen to shit like this.

743
00:48:38.501 --> 00:48:41.172
Fuck. I'll keep it 1.000 with
you. boy.

744
00:48:41.205 --> 00:48:42.106
What type of cars you be seeing

745
00:48:42.139 --> 00:48:43.975
punk ass white people driving
nowadays?

746
00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:49.013
Prius's. Leafs.

747
00:48:49.046 --> 00:48:50.480
Ever since I got this shit. man.

748
00:48:50.513 --> 00:48:52.149
the police ain't fucked
with a nigger. man.

749
00:48:52.183 --> 00:48:55.086
It's true. ever since he got
the Prius.

750
00:48:55.119 --> 00:48:57.754
he ain't never been stopped by
the police.

751
00:48:57.787 --> 00:48:59.156
Then I went like this. I
was like well fuck it. man.

752
00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.992
I'm a go all the way in. you
feel me?

753
00:49:01.025 --> 00:49:04.161
I got me some fucking
thick ass fucking glasses.

754
00:49:04.195 --> 00:49:06.596
some tiny shirts and tiny jeans.
nigga.

755
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:08.732
Took this bitch. put a fucking

756
00:49:08.765 --> 00:49:11.768
Key Tahoe blue sticker
on the back and shit.

757
00:49:11.801 --> 00:49:14.105
White folks be loving
some blue ass licks.

758
00:49:14.138 --> 00:49:15.438
Don't they?

759
00:49:15.472 --> 00:49:16.374
Them mother fucks will jump off

760
00:49:16.439 --> 00:49:18.109
bridges on they birthday
for that bullshit.

761
00:49:18.142 --> 00:49:19.442
Then I was like all right nigga.

762
00:49:19.476 --> 00:49:21.444
I got my little outfit. you feel
me?

763
00:49:21.478 --> 00:49:23.180
Now a nigga needs some theme
music.

764
00:49:23.214 --> 00:49:25.649
So I said all right. what's the
whitest

765
00:49:25.682 --> 00:49:28.052
fucking music you ain't
never gonna hear some

766
00:49:28.085 --> 00:49:30.754
niggas from Oakland playing
when they riding around?

767
00:49:32.689 --> 00:49:33.690
Heavy metal. nigga.

768
00:49:34.591 --> 00:49:36.193
When it hit me. nigga. shit man.

769
00:49:36.227 --> 00:49:36.860
I started going into the
archives.

770
00:49:36.893 --> 00:49:38.895
like what music can I find?

771
00:49:38.929 --> 00:49:40.597
That's when I get my Matt
Pinfield on. you feel me?

772
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:41.831
You know what was crazy?

773
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.936
I started actually liking that
shit. bro.

774
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:48.939
Like early Judas Priest
and fucking Slayer.

775
00:49:48.973 --> 00:49:50.807
some Black Sabbath. man.

776
00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:52.809
I even like some shit by White
Pride. man

777
00:49:52.842 --> 00:49:54.511
and I started going to their
concerts and all that shit.

778
00:49:54.544 --> 00:49:55.745
We went with these
little white broads. man.

779
00:49:55.779 --> 00:49:58.882
They took niggas down to this
fucking Lyles Rockney show.

780
00:49:58.915 --> 00:50:00.884
We was all in the mosh pit and
shit. boy.

781
00:50:00.917 --> 00:50:03.620
We were fucking stomping on
these white boys heads and shit.

782
00:50:03.653 --> 00:50:05.056
Mother fucker jumped up.

783
00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:07.757
he was like "Fuck yeah
bro. do that shit. man."

784
00:50:12.595 --> 00:50:15.465
I felt like I discovered
another part of myself in there.

785
00:50:18.135 --> 00:50:20.137
Like a spiritual part. you feel
me?

786
00:50:21.172 --> 00:50:22.505
That's real.

787
00:50:24.976 --> 00:50:25.775
You look like you're ready

788
00:50:25.809 --> 00:50:27.610
to take it up a notch. right
Harold?

789
00:50:28.712 --> 00:50:32.949
'Cause I was thinking we
could go out to my car.

790
00:50:32.984 --> 00:50:34.684
What. you don't know?

791
00:50:34.718 --> 00:50:36.153
You know. you know.

792
00:50:37.754 --> 00:50:42.126
Yeah. let's do it.

793
00:50:42.159 --> 00:50:43.027
Sherm.

794
00:50:44.594 --> 00:50:45.262
Shit.

795
00:50:46.297 --> 00:50:48.032
Yo baby. Harold's gotta roll.

796
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:51.668
I've been texting
your ass for 30 minutes.

797
00:51:12.622 --> 00:51:13.823
Hey yo Jay. can you switch

798
00:51:13.857 --> 00:51:16.193
the music to something more
chill?

799
00:51:16.227 --> 00:51:18.561
Like Dave Matthews or something?

800
00:51:18.595 --> 00:51:19.997
What?

801
00:51:20.031 --> 00:51:22.266
Man. fuck Dave Matthews.

802
00:51:22.299 --> 00:51:24.301
That mother fucker be playing
eight minute solos and shit.

803
00:51:24.335 --> 00:51:25.668
You sitting in the stadium.

804
00:51:25.702 --> 00:51:27.271
your ass will fucking fall
asleep.

805
00:51:28.938 --> 00:51:31.608
I fucking like Dave Matthews.

806
00:51:32.809 --> 00:51:33.943
Do I know you?

807
00:51:35.012 --> 00:51:35.879
No.

808
00:51:37.248 --> 00:51:39.183
I feel like I've seen you
somewhere.

809
00:51:39.216 --> 00:51:40.683
That's the tweak. nigga.

810
00:51:41.385 --> 00:51:42.852
Pointillism. y'all.

811
00:51:42.886 --> 00:51:44.621
That's all we in it for.
pointillism.

812
00:51:44.654 --> 00:51:46.123
- Say what?
- Pointillism.

813
00:51:46.157 --> 00:51:47.091
You don't know what that is?

814
00:51:47.124 --> 00:51:48.993
Take an art history lesson.
nigga. damn.

815
00:51:49.893 --> 00:51:51.795
When we get up in this spot.

816
00:51:51.828 --> 00:51:53.663
don't touch shit up on this real
estate.

817
00:51:53.696 --> 00:51:56.100
We don't need no cash.
we don't need no jewels.

818
00:51:56.133 --> 00:51:57.968
All we looking for is
these two George Seurat

819
00:51:58.002 --> 00:52:00.371
paintings from the
French Impressionist Era.

820
00:52:00.404 --> 00:52:02.239
Pointillism is the style
that they credit him with

821
00:52:02.273 --> 00:52:04.874
that he came up with
because he would use these

822
00:52:04.908 --> 00:52:07.311
tiny paint dots to
create his masterpieces.

823
00:52:07.344 --> 00:52:09.813
He revolutionized the game. man.

824
00:52:09.846 --> 00:52:12.383
I thought you said this was
big. homes.

825
00:52:12.416 --> 00:52:14.818
It is big. fool.
Fuck you think we doing?

826
00:52:14.851 --> 00:52:16.753
I don't need no fucking art.

827
00:52:16.786 --> 00:52:17.921
I just hit the jackpot with this

828
00:52:17.955 --> 00:52:20.224
rich motherfucker's plastic I
stole.

829
00:52:20.257 --> 00:52:23.227
Got some ladies. some
mother fucking champagne.

830
00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:25.862
You drank it all and them
bitches ain't even here. right?

831
00:52:25.895 --> 00:52:28.332
See when the dollar collapses
and the Fed calls in

832
00:52:28.365 --> 00:52:31.368
the country's debt and quits
printing big faces. man.

833
00:52:31.402 --> 00:52:33.304
everybody's gonna want
to have put their money

834
00:52:33.337 --> 00:52:35.206
into some shit that actually
holds some value. man.

835
00:52:35.239 --> 00:52:39.843
Like some fine art. some land.
some water or some shit. man.

836
00:52:39.876 --> 00:52:43.247
Can't do no shit with no fucking
strippers and credit cards.

837
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.881
Alright. Wall Street.

838
00:52:44.914 --> 00:52:46.283
As long as I get my 20%.

839
00:52:48.018 --> 00:52:50.920
What the fuck you keep
staring at. old man?

840
00:52:50.955 --> 00:52:53.424
I finally figured out
where you know me from.

841
00:52:53.457 --> 00:52:54.858
Oh yeah. where's that?

842
00:52:54.891 --> 00:52:57.627
Ross. you know me through Fred
Ross.

843
00:52:59.296 --> 00:53:02.066
The liquor store. that's
how I know your ass.

844
00:53:02.099 --> 00:53:03.400
You bumped into me at the liquor
store.

845
00:53:03.434 --> 00:53:05.269
- Yeah. I don't think so.
- No. it happened.

846
00:53:05.302 --> 00:53:07.371
Jay. how do you know
this motherfucker. man?

847
00:53:07.404 --> 00:53:08.705
I'm not liking this shit right
now.

848
00:53:08.738 --> 00:53:10.307
Nigga. shut the fuck up.

849
00:53:11.242 --> 00:53:13.810
This ain't no competition.
it's a cooperation. man.

850
00:53:13.843 --> 00:53:15.412
He the driver. that's why he
here.

851
00:53:16.447 --> 00:53:18.382
That's all your white ass need
to know.

852
00:53:24.321 --> 00:53:26.923
I'm a make it simple for you.
Pete.

853
00:53:26.957 --> 00:53:28.025
Text me on this phone
after you make sure that

854
00:53:28.058 --> 00:53:31.095
there ain't no house sitter
up in here or some shit.

855
00:53:31.128 --> 00:53:33.130
We gonna come through in the
Prius.

856
00:53:33.164 --> 00:53:36.167
We gonna come out with the
shit two minutes later.

857
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.902
You gonna call me and slowly
drive us up to the Prius.

858
00:53:38.935 --> 00:53:40.937
Prez gonna be parked up like a
mile away.

859
00:53:41.838 --> 00:53:43.207
Then from there. you leave.

860
00:53:44.741 --> 00:53:47.911
We don't have no contact
for at least a week. got it?

861
00:53:47.944 --> 00:53:49.213
All right. I got it.

862
00:54:26.816 --> 00:54:28.252
Y'all got two minutes.

863
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:34.824
Fuck this. I'm calling
Natalie.

864
00:54:36.126 --> 00:54:38.529
How the fuck do you dial on this
phone?

865
00:54:38.562 --> 00:54:41.398
I'm not liking this.

866
00:54:41.432 --> 00:54:45.868
There's somebody
breaking in on Starks.

867
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.429
- Let's go.
- Let's fucking go. fucker.

868
00:55:12.463 --> 00:55:14.198
I'm trying!

869
00:55:14.231 --> 00:55:15.432
It won't start.

870
00:55:18.035 --> 00:55:19.336
Come pick us up near the car.

871
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:21.305
Man. hurry up!

872
00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:38.522
Man. let's go. come on. come on.

873
00:55:48.365 --> 00:55:49.233
Fuck man.

874
00:55:51.068 --> 00:55:53.137
I'm bleeding out. Jay.
this look bad to you. man?

875
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:53.971
I ain't no fucking doctor.

876
00:55:54.004 --> 00:55:55.838
How the fuck I'm supposed to
know?

877
00:55:55.872 --> 00:55:57.074
You gotta get me to a
hospital.

878
00:55:57.107 --> 00:55:58.941
Drop me off at Highland.

879
00:55:58.976 --> 00:56:00.210
What's the plan?

880
00:56:01.211 --> 00:56:03.347
The cops gonna think the
Volvo was stolen anyway.

881
00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.182
So we ain't gotta trip on that.

882
00:56:05.215 --> 00:56:06.916
The only thing I'm worried
about is this whip right here.

883
00:56:06.949 --> 00:56:08.851
You fucking hear me?

884
00:56:08.885 --> 00:56:09.952
We gotta get me to a hospital.

885
00:56:09.987 --> 00:56:11.921
Highland's 10 minutes from here.

886
00:56:11.955 --> 00:56:15.125
Shut the fuck up. you
trigger-happy mother fucker.

887
00:56:15.159 --> 00:56:16.926
We go to Highland. we all go
down.

888
00:56:19.229 --> 00:56:21.332
I'm a fucking kill
you when this is done.

889
00:56:22.499 --> 00:56:26.070
That's right. look away you
fucking bald fat piece of shit.

890
00:56:26.103 --> 00:56:27.404
This is all your fucking fault.

891
00:56:27.438 --> 00:56:30.341
Tell you what? Why don't
you fucking try it. huh?

892
00:56:30.374 --> 00:56:31.975
I'll fucking crack your skull
open

893
00:56:32.009 --> 00:56:34.244
Just like I did your
little buddy Fred Ross.

894
00:56:36.647 --> 00:56:39.249
- You didn't kill Fred Ross.
- The hell I didn't.

895
00:56:40.351 --> 00:56:42.086
Dude in the Tesla killed Ross

896
00:56:45.022 --> 00:56:46.090
and you ain't driving no Tesla.

897
00:56:48.925 --> 00:56:51.228
What?

898
00:56:51.261 --> 00:56:52.429
What'd you say?

899
00:56:56.567 --> 00:56:57.434
Sherm?

900
00:57:03.974 --> 00:57:06.876
I know this white boy
didn't just die in my car.

901
00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.582
That's not good.

902
00:57:26.663 --> 00:57:29.333
What can I get you?

903
00:57:31.034 --> 00:57:33.470
How long ago did my friend
Harold leave?

904
00:57:35.973 --> 00:57:36.640
Who?

905
00:57:41.378 --> 00:57:42.246
Thank you.

906
00:57:43.981 --> 00:57:47.985
He's been gone about 45 minutes
but he's probably out back.

907
00:57:50.387 --> 00:57:51.655
Which is his car?

908
00:57:54.324 --> 00:57:55.559
He has a Dave
Matthews

909
00:57:55.592 --> 00:57:57.961
sticker on the back. you can't
miss it.

910
00:58:25.522 --> 00:58:30.527
Code 187. Code 187.

911
00:58:31.094 --> 00:58:33.530
Code 187. requesting an
ambulance.

912
00:58:33.564 --> 00:58:36.467
All units be on the lookout
for two white males.

913
00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:40.003
one aged 50 to 60. the other 20
to 30.

914
00:58:40.671 --> 00:58:42.606
I left with that fool.

915
00:58:42.639 --> 00:58:44.508
Everybody up in there seen that
shit.

916
00:58:45.476 --> 00:58:47.678
We got a dead white
woman on our hands. man.

917
00:58:47.711 --> 00:58:49.313
You know what that shit means.

918
00:58:51.181 --> 00:58:52.683
Give me one of his cigarettes.

919
00:58:54.251 --> 00:58:55.185
I thought you quit.

920
00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:06.230
I can hide his car.

921
00:59:10.267 --> 00:59:11.268
What you offering?

922
00:59:14.238 --> 00:59:17.808
Give me my ring
back and I'll stash the car.

923
00:59:17.841 --> 00:59:20.277
- Where?
- I got a buddy in Petaluma.

924
00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:22.045
I can stash it there.

925
00:59:24.181 --> 00:59:25.048
We got a deal?

926
00:59:50.841 --> 00:59:52.075
Please pick up.

927
00:59:52.109 --> 00:59:54.645
Hi. you've reached
Natalie. you know the drill.

928
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:09.693
Pete. what the
fuck are you wearing?

929
01:00:09.726 --> 01:00:11.128
I like your look.

930
01:00:12.462 --> 01:00:13.830
Some

931
01:00:13.864 --> 01:00:16.433
kind of hipster.

932
01:00:16.466 --> 01:00:17.801
Is that what you call that?

933
01:00:22.306 --> 01:00:27.377
Well then. I'm gonna take
my tea and head upstairs.

934
01:00:27.411 --> 01:00:28.412
Okay. hon.

935
01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.547
Goodnight.

936
01:00:34.418 --> 01:00:35.352
Hey Peter.

937
01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.522
You know in the course of my
career.

938
01:00:38.555 --> 01:00:43.393
I've been on. fuck. 5.000 crime
scenes.

939
01:00:43.427 --> 01:00:45.629
So little details. they're not
lost on me.

940
01:00:45.662 --> 01:00:47.864
Like when a guy show up at my
house

941
01:00:47.898 --> 01:00:49.633
with blood under his
fingernails.

942
01:00:53.403 --> 01:00:55.772
What the fuck are you
doing here in my house?

943
01:00:56.907 --> 01:00:59.743
Is there a place I
could have a cigarette?

944
01:00:59.776 --> 01:01:00.777
I thought you quit that too.

945
01:01:00.811 --> 01:01:01.878
No. you can't smoke in here.

946
01:01:01.912 --> 01:01:04.581
She'll have a nervous
breakdown. let's go outside.

947
01:01:11.655 --> 01:01:14.725
You know it's leaking oil.
right?

948
01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:15.826
What the hell is this?

949
01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:19.196
Get the hell out. look at that.

950
01:01:19.229 --> 01:01:21.765
Look. it's one of those tracking
devices.

951
01:01:22.666 --> 01:01:23.767
What's it for?

952
01:01:24.835 --> 01:01:26.570
Usually you see these from
some spouse

953
01:01:26.603 --> 01:01:27.671
think's the other one's
fucking around on 'em

954
01:01:27.704 --> 01:01:30.207
and they put it up under the
car.

955
01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.476
I can't imagine why a
tweaker would have it though.

956
01:01:32.509 --> 01:01:35.712
The cops can't use 'em.
the judges don't allow it.

957
01:01:35.746 --> 01:01:36.613
It's weird.

958
01:01:38.682 --> 01:01:39.850
Pete. what is the matter?

959
01:01:44.554 --> 01:01:47.658
I really fucked up. You
gotta help me out of this shit.

960
01:01:47.691 --> 01:01:50.594
Shh. you're gonna fucking wake
her up.

961
01:01:51.963 --> 01:01:57.267
Listen to me Peter. nobody
is gonna care that he's gone.

962
01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.670
Nobody. the world's a
better place without him.

963
01:01:59.703 --> 01:02:00.570
That said.

964
01:02:01.672 --> 01:02:04.408
did you get any information
before he went bye bye?

965
01:02:05.977 --> 01:02:09.546
He said the guy that
murdered Fred Ross was

966
01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:13.417
driving a Tesla. you know.
one of those electric cars.

967
01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:14.484
But I mean he was dying. man.

968
01:02:14.518 --> 01:02:15.686
He wasn't making a lot of sense.

969
01:02:15.719 --> 01:02:17.688
Listen to me. you called me
this morning

970
01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:19.623
and I called my buddies at the
Department.

971
01:02:19.656 --> 01:02:22.459
Would you believe that when
Wong got killed. some hipsters

972
01:02:22.492 --> 01:02:25.429
in the neighborhood had a
fucking drone in the air?

973
01:02:25.462 --> 01:02:29.700
They caught it. now they sent
me the footage from downtown.

974
01:02:29.733 --> 01:02:30.801
You can't see the perp's face

975
01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:31.969
but I'm pretty sure it's a
Tesla.

976
01:02:32.003 --> 01:02:34.705
Let me just go pull it up on the
computer.

977
01:02:34.738 --> 01:02:35.605
You know what?

978
01:02:36.740 --> 01:02:39.810
Trying being Superman for
awhile and not Clark Kent.

979
01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:41.745
Finish your cig and then come
inside.

980
01:03:24.921 --> 01:03:27.858
Hey dude. I got it. check this
out.

981
01:03:54.451 --> 01:03:55.318
Jack.

982
01:03:59.523 --> 01:04:01.391
Jack. what's going on?

983
01:05:29.479 --> 01:05:30.814
Come and find me.

984
01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:00.777
Why don't you go home.
man?

985
01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:01.811
Just sleep this one off.

986
01:06:02.812 --> 01:06:05.482
Why don't you give me
some good shifts. Todd?

987
01:06:06.483 --> 01:06:08.119
While you're at it. why don't
you give me a whiskey too

988
01:06:08.152 --> 01:06:11.055
or have your little social
bitch give me a bottle.

989
01:06:11.088 --> 01:06:13.224
What the fuck is wrong with
you. Pete?

990
01:06:13.257 --> 01:06:14.824
Hey. hey. let's
cut him some slack.

991
01:06:14.858 --> 01:06:16.793
Obviously he's had a rough day.
right?

992
01:06:17.827 --> 01:06:21.966
I guess the bigger they
are. the harder they fall.

993
01:06:21.999 --> 01:06:24.235
off the wagon. that is.

994
01:06:24.268 --> 01:06:25.802
Natalie. hey. it's me.

995
01:06:28.605 --> 01:06:30.007
Yeah. he's here.

996
01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:31.541
Do you mind picking him up?

997
01:06:39.516 --> 01:06:41.152
How long we gotta sit in here?

998
01:06:41.185 --> 01:06:43.988
We doing something with the
Prius?

999
01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:45.889
No. we'll be hiding in plain
sight.

1000
01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:48.591
Unless you've got a better idea.

1001
01:06:50.927 --> 01:06:53.863
Cuz. go pack your ski
clothes. we goin' to Tahoe.

1002
01:06:58.702 --> 01:07:00.870
Where are the restrooms?

1003
01:07:00.904 --> 01:07:02.739
This beet juice is kicking in
again.

1004
01:07:05.608 --> 01:07:07.644
You ever had 12 ounces of beet
juice?

1005
01:07:29.033 --> 01:07:31.868
Dad wake up. it's time to go.

1006
01:07:31.901 --> 01:07:32.769
Pete.

1007
01:07:34.038 --> 01:07:35.705
Natalie. Natalie.

1008
01:07:36.706 --> 01:07:37.574
Natalie.

1009
01:07:38.875 --> 01:07:40.910
Look what I got ya.

1010
01:07:40.944 --> 01:07:42.512
What the fuck is
that?

1011
01:07:45.016 --> 01:07:48.052
It's hers. I saved it for you.

1012
01:07:51.355 --> 01:07:53.057
How drunk are you?

1013
01:07:53.090 --> 01:07:53.958
I'm sorry.

1014
01:07:55.592 --> 01:07:57.294
To think I was worried
about you when you

1015
01:07:57.328 --> 01:07:59.562
didn't show up to the party.
I should have known better.

1016
01:07:59.596 --> 01:08:01.598
Natalie. listen to me. I saw
him.

1017
01:08:02.599 --> 01:08:04.035
You're not making any sense.

1018
01:08:04.068 --> 01:08:05.802
The man that killed your
mother.

1019
01:08:09.706 --> 01:08:11.908
This is what you want to go
back to?

1020
01:08:12.977 --> 01:08:14.744
Well I'm not gonna stop you.

1021
01:08:14.778 --> 01:08:16.313
- I'm done.
- Natalie. listen to me.

1022
01:08:16.347 --> 01:08:19.216
I know what happened that
night.

1023
01:08:20.217 --> 01:08:22.987
Everyone always said it was your
fault.

1024
01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:26.923
You were the one driving the
car. not her

1025
01:08:26.957 --> 01:08:28.792
and you left her there.

1026
01:08:29.893 --> 01:08:32.595
She was a sitting duck
and you left her alone.

1027
01:08:32.629 --> 01:08:33.364
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1028
01:08:33.397 --> 01:08:35.132
so you shut the fuck up.

1029
01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:39.903
Don't pretend this
whole sober charade you've

1030
01:08:39.936 --> 01:08:42.839
been putting on for the last
six years erases any of that.

1031
01:08:46.643 --> 01:08:47.978
And don't come to my wedding.

1032
01:09:04.095 --> 01:09:05.963
Hey. do you have a
cigarette I can bum off you?

1033
01:09:05.996 --> 01:09:08.999
- Sorry. this is my last one.
- I got a fresh pack.

1034
01:09:14.071 --> 01:09:14.938
Thank you.

1035
01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.208
Here you go.

1036
01:09:20.411 --> 01:09:21.878
You really shouldn't smoke.

1037
01:09:23.314 --> 01:09:24.181
It's dangerous.

1038
01:09:38.195 --> 01:09:40.064
Pete. where's Natalie. man?

1039
01:09:40.097 --> 01:09:41.198
I've been trying to get
ahold of her. where is she?

1040
01:09:41.232 --> 01:09:42.099
Oh Sean.

1041

01:09:45.702 --> 01:09:47.737
Pete but tell me where Natalie

1044
01:09:47.770 --> 01:09:49.073
I've been trying to look
for her. where is she?

1045
01:09:49.106 --> 01:09:51.774
She got mad at me and she left
the bar.

1046
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.917
Shit. man.

1047
01:10:02.386 --> 01:10:03.820

1048
01:10:03.853 --> 01:10:04.721
Oh shit.

1049
01:10:06.056 --> 01:10:07.992
We gotta call the cops.

1050
01:10:15.765 --> 01:10:17.334
What the fuck is this guy
doing?

1051
01:10:20.337 --> 01:10:21.205
Shit.

1052
01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:26.709
It's fine Natalie. don't worry.

1053
01:10:26.743 --> 01:10:28.078
Mommy's got this.

1054
01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:31.081
Everything's just fine.

1055
01:10:39.889 --> 01:10:44.894
Shit.

1056
01:10:57.474 --> 01:11:02.479
Sharry. really. what

1057
01:11:03.514 --> 01:11:05.349
And the baby's alone.

1058
01:11:06.317 --> 01:11:10.487
Great. I need to put
the fucker down. right?

1059
01:11:10.521 --> 01:11:12.189
Sharry?

1060
01:11:12.223 --> 01:11:13.090
Sharry?

1061
01:11:13.991 --> 01:11:14.857
Sharry?

1062
01:12:00.170 --> 01:12:01.771
Man. wake your ass up.

1063
01:12:03.007 --> 01:12:04.475
Where am I?

1064
01:12:04.508 --> 01:12:06.977
Don't worry about where
the fuck you at. boy.

1065
01:12:07.011 --> 01:12:08.145
Originally I was gonna leave

1066
01:12:08.178 --> 01:12:11.415
your fat ass down the road
somewhere. slumped. nigger.

1067
01:12:11.448 --> 01:12:13.050
It's your lucky day. Pete.

1068
01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:15.918
'Cause of you. I got me a good
luck charm.

1069
01:12:15.952 --> 01:12:19.023
A motherfucking black card.
endless flow of credit.

1070
01:12:20.124 --> 01:12:21.158
It's not really a good time

1071
01:12:21.191 --> 01:12:22.925
for me to be taking a road trip.

1072
01:12:23.594 --> 01:12:26.196
Mother fucker. this
ain't no fucking road trip.

1073
01:12:29.199 --> 01:12:30.434
Put that shit on.

1074
01:12:30.467 --> 01:12:32.469
You gonna help us rob this
Harold Price.

1075
01:12:33.604 --> 01:12:36.040
Not getting my ass shot for your
dumb ass.

1076
01:12:36.939 --> 01:12:39.576
Part-owner of some big ass
companies.

1077
01:12:39.610 --> 01:12:41.944
I'll tell you. Harold Price got
so much motherfucking money.

1078
01:12:41.979 --> 01:12:43.547
he don't even know what to do
with it.

1079
01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.182
Nigga got more money than God.

1080
01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:49.919
That's why he got a place
in Maui. LA. New York

1081
01:12:49.952 --> 01:12:52.289
and this lakefront property
right here in Tahoe.

1082
01:13:01.498 --> 01:13:03.833
Do you know Steph Curry?

1083
01:13:05.602 --> 01:13:06.470
No.

1084
01:13:07.638 --> 01:13:09.106
Do you know Steph Curry?

1085
01:13:11.608 --> 01:13:12.476
No.

1086
01:13:13.644 --> 01:13:17.014
But aren't you guys
professional basketball players?

1087
01:13:22.453 --> 01:13:23.886
Lacrosse.

1088
01:13:32.663 --> 01:13:34.498
You fucking kidding me right
now?

1089
01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:37.134
I don't need no art.
I just hit the jackpot

1090
01:13:37.167 --> 01:13:40.237
with this rich mother
fucker's plastic I stole.

1091
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:42.639
Got me some ladies. some
motherfucking champagne.

1092
01:13:43.574 --> 01:13:44.742
I got me a good luck
charm.

1093
01:13:44.775 --> 01:13:48.479
As I said. there was something
metal like brass knuckles.

1094
01:13:48.512 --> 01:13:51.281
Killed Fred Ross was driving a
Tesla.

1095
01:13:52.416 --> 01:13:55.285
I saw the man that
killed that your mother-

1096
01:13:59.189 --> 01:14:01.225
- Mother fucker look like
he just seen a ghost.

1097
01:14:04.027 --> 01:14:05.529
Let's just get this over with.

1098
01:14:26.116 --> 01:14:29.186
Hell yeah. I'm feeling
good about this one. boy.

1099
01:14:29.219 --> 01:14:31.622
- There's no cars there.
- What about the garage?

1100
01:14:33.323 --> 01:14:35.459
Okay. let me see.

1101
01:14:39.596 --> 01:14:40.697
Come on. nigga.

1102
01:14:40.731 --> 01:14:42.065
This ain't no time for no flying
lesson.

1103
01:14:42.099 --> 01:14:43.267
I thought you knew how to work
this shit.

1104
01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.402
It won't let me fly over
the property for some reason.

1105
01:14:45.436 --> 01:14:47.438
Didn't you say this drone
had range of over a mile?

1106
01:14:47.471 --> 01:14:49.406
It does but it won't
let me.

1107
01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:00.250
Hon?

1108
01:15:01.518 --> 01:15:03.287
What? I'm getting
ready.

1109
01:15:06.523 --> 01:15:08.292
You want to go to Tahoe
instead?

1110
01:15:10.527 --> 01:15:12.129
- Damn.
- Ooh. boy.

1111
01:15:15.232 --> 01:15:17.267

1112
01:15:17.301 --> 01:15:18.535

We have a fundraiser with
Karen and Ed in DC. remember?

1117
01:15:32.516 --> 01:15:34.751
Something more important came

Happy early anniversary. baby.

Hey Pete. you good?

Keep doing your thing. man.

1125
01:16:09.186 --> 01:16:10.687
You're our white alibi this
trip.

1126
01:16:15.158 --> 01:16:16.493
I don't trust your ass. man.

1127

01:16:25.202 --> 01:16:26.069
Hold on.

1130
01:16:26.803 --> 01:16:28.038
Is that a hot tub?

1131
01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:34.578
White people.

1132
01:16:37.714 --> 01:16:41.184
You mean rich white
people. don't get it twisted.

1133
01:16:42.586 --> 01:16:44.721
Man. I could get used
to living like this.

1134
01:16:48.191 --> 01:16:49.726
What you mean.
used to living like what?

1135
01:16:50.694 --> 01:16:53.063
Living like
white people. you know?

1136
01:16:53.730 --> 01:16:57.467
Wine tasting. going in a hot air
balloon.

1137
01:16:58.402 --> 01:16:59.469
Shit like that. man.

1138
01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.441
You can do all that shit. man.

1139
01:17:04.474 --> 01:17:06.209
You ain't gotta be white to do
that shit.

1140
01:17:07.311 --> 01:17:08.779
Just look at Pete. man.

1141

You think he got hot air balloons.

1144
01:17:19.489 --> 01:17:20.424
He ain't got shit.

1145
01:18:09.539 --> 01:18:10.407
Oh shit.

1146
01:18:11.508 --> 01:18:12.376
Oh no.

1147
01:18:14.811 --> 01:18:15.679
Prez?

1148
01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:17.481
Prez?

1149
01:18:21.518 --> 01:18:23.186
I guess you didn't

1150
01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.488
need to bring your golf clubs
after all.

1151
01:18:25.555 --> 01:18:27.524
Prez. Prez. pull your shit up.

Look at that.

1154
01:18:34.264 --> 01:18:35.165
Might be part of the
new

1155
01:18:35.198 --> 01:18:37.334
security system they installed
yesterday.

1156
01:18:39.971 --> 01:18:40.837
Prez.

1157
01:18:45.742 --> 01:18:47.511
Come on. they home.

1158
01:18:57.954 --> 01:19:00.323
Holy shit.

1159
01:19:00.357 --> 01:19:01.758
the paintings.

1160
01:19:01.792 --> 01:19:03.560
Harold. we've been robbed.

1161
01:19:03.593 --> 01:19:05.562
- We sure have.
- Harold.

1162
01:19:14.838 --> 01:19:16.873
Come on. what are you stopping
for?

1163
01:19:16.907 --> 01:19:17.741
Man. come on.

1164
01:19:18.942 --> 01:19:20.343
I'm staying here.

1165
01:19:24.414 --> 01:19:25.816
Why don't you go upstairs.

1166
01:19:25.849 --> 01:19:28.385
see if your jewelry's still
here.

1167
01:19:28.418 --> 01:19:30.253
Do you think they took my
jewelry?

1168
01:19:30.988 --> 01:19:33.356
And if they did. we'll replace
that too.

1169
01:19:34.357 --> 01:19:37.527
Sweetheart. while you're up
there. why don't you freshen up?

1170
01:19:38.929 --> 01:19:41.598
We're not gonna let this
ruin our romantic weekend.

1171
01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:46.470
I just feel so fucking
violated.

1172
01:20:26.676 --> 01:20:28.512
Oh shit.

1173
01:20:39.090 --> 01:20:40.524
Where's your shirt?

1174
01:20:40.557 --> 01:20:42.226
That sink exploded on
me.

1175
01:20:46.097 --> 01:20:47.397
What was that noise?

1176
01:20:48.632 --> 01:20:51.701
It was air in the pipes in
that bathroom. it's horrible.

1177
01:20:55.705 --> 01:20:56.706
It's all gone.

1178
01:20:57.707 --> 01:21:00.577
My pearls. diamonds. everything.

1179
01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:06.716
Something tells me we're
gonna get them back real soon.

1180
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:09.686
I know. I know it can
be replaced. it's just

1181
01:21:12.589 --> 01:21:15.725
do you think the thieves
are still around here?

1182
01:21:15.759 --> 01:21:19.030
No. no one would hang around.

1183
01:21:36.646 --> 01:21:38.682
Come on. keys. keys.

1184
01:21:38.715 --> 01:21:40.917
Shit man. I must've left 'em
inside.

1185
01:21:44.554 --> 01:21:47.457
I'm gonna
put a roast in the oven

1186
01:21:47.490 --> 01:21:49.392
and in a couple hours we're
gonna have

1187
01:21:49.426 --> 01:21:52.029
a nice meal and we're
gonna shake all this off.

1188
01:21:52.896 --> 01:21:55.398
Why don't you take a nice hot
shower?

1189
01:22:08.478 --> 01:22:11.048
What the fuck is wrong with
you?

1190
01:22:11.082 --> 01:22:13.150
It's him.

1191
01:22:13.184 --> 01:22:14.618
He killed my wife.

1192
01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:17.921
He killed my daughter.

1193
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:22.926
Pete. you knew this shit
the whole goddamn time

1194
01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.527
and you didn't fucking say
nothing?

1195
01:22:24.561 --> 01:22:26.630
I oughta kill your ass my
goddamn self.

1196
01:22:26.663 --> 01:22:29.499
You led us straight to
the goddamn devil's lair.

1197
01:22:29.532 --> 01:22:30.934
No. you led us here.

1198
01:22:33.204 --> 01:22:37.108
Listen man. it's two against
one.

1199
01:22:37.141 --> 01:22:38.675
We in this shit together now.

1200
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:08.838
Hey listen. you distract 'em.

1201
01:23:10.607 --> 01:23:12.609
I'm gonna go get my gun.

1202
01:23:24.956 --> 01:23:26.589
They must be upstairs.

1203
01:24:05.628 --> 01:24:06.763
- Sherman?
- No.

1204
01:24:14.138 --> 01:24:17.074
- Where's Sherman?
- Pete. he's down here!

1205
01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:05.755
I hope you enjoyed yourself on
my dime.

1206
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:22.705
- Get out.
- Oh my god.

1207
01:25:22.739 --> 01:25:23.606
Get out.

1208
01:25:25.142 --> 01:25:26.676
Where'd that ring come from?

1209
01:25:29.646 --> 01:25:31.614
My husband gave it to me.

1210
01:25:31.648 --> 01:25:33.217
You can have it.

1211
01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:34.151
Did he kill her?

1212
01:25:36.253 --> 01:25:37.154
- What?
- My daughter.

1213
01:25:37.188 --> 01:25:38.888
did he kill her?

1214
01:25:38.922 --> 01:25:39.889
There must be some kind of
mistake.

1215
01:25:39.923 --> 01:25:43.726
My husband. he's just
a venture capitalist.

1216
01:26:02.346 --> 01:26:04.814
Is it everything
you imagined. Pete?

1217
01:26:06.317 --> 01:26:08.185
Harry. you know him?

1218
01:26:08.219 --> 01:26:10.221
He's just
looking for his daughter.

1219
01:26:10.254 --> 01:26:13.224
Please tell him you
don't know where she is.

1220
01:26:13.257 --> 01:26:14.024
Where's Natalie?

1221
01:26:15.392 --> 01:26:17.294
Well you're her dad. you tell
me.

1222
01:26:18.295 --> 01:26:19.263
Fuck you.

1223
01:26:20.864 --> 01:26:22.166
You took that ring from her.

1224
01:26:23.367 --> 01:26:27.037
No. she gave that to me at
that bar where you work at.

1225
01:26:28.272 --> 01:26:30.773
She traded it actually for a
cigarette.

1226
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:37.081
Don't you fucking lie to me.
Natalie would never do that.

1227
01:26:39.782 --> 01:26:42.186
Sometimes people just
need a shoulder to cry on

1228
01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:45.222
and she certainly never had
yours.

1229
01:26:45.256 --> 01:26:47.790
What the fuck are you
talking about. Harold?

1230
01:26:48.758 --> 01:26:49.692
Will you tell him the truth?

1231
01:26:49.726 --> 01:26:52.929
Tell him that you don't know
where she is.

1232
01:26:52.963 --> 01:26:54.431
Should I tell him that I don't
know

1233
01:26:54.465 --> 01:26:57.368
where she is or should
I tell him the truth?

1234
01:26:57.401 --> 01:26:59.170
After all. it was you who was
driving

1235
01:26:59.203 --> 01:27:03.073
the car that night. wasn't it.
macho man?

1236
01:27:05.509 --> 01:27:07.178
Yeah. that's who you are.

1237
01:27:13.783 --> 01:27:15.319
You ever put on a pair of these?

1238
01:27:17.154 --> 01:27:19.190
Nevermind. I can tell the
answer's no.

1239
01:27:20.958 --> 01:27:23.826
You'd a been real proud of
Natalie.

1240
01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:25.695
She was a very tough girl.

1241
01:27:26.829 --> 01:27:29.166
She didn't scream nearly
as much as her mom did.

1242
01:27:46.317 --> 01:27:49.886
29 years and it all comes down
to that.

1243
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:54.924
How does that make you feel?

1244
01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:57.428
Deflated?

1245
01:27:59.330 --> 01:28:01.764
You should have taken my advice.
Pete.

1246
01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:07.371
You crossed a line that
now cannot be uncrossed.

1247
01:28:45.142 --> 01:28:46.010
Here.

1248
01:28:48.945 --> 01:28:51.148
Hello?

1249
01:28:51.181 --> 01:28:52.449
Hello?

1250
01:28:52.483 --> 01:28:57.454
Just some fucking blocked number.
probably another robocall.

1251
01:28:58.188 --> 01:28:59.990
You killed my wife

1252
01:29:00.024 --> 01:29:02.892
for something that happened 30
years ago.

1253
01:29:02.925 --> 01:29:04.927
That makes you worse than me.

1254
01:29:05.862 --> 01:29:08.032
Nobody deserves what you did.

1255
01:29:08.065 --> 01:29:08.931
Sure.

1256
01:29:10.134 --> 01:29:12.303
but I gave your wife the chance

1257
01:29:12.336 --> 01:29:17.274
to apologize for your bad
behavior and it just didn't take.

1258
01:29:17.308 --> 01:29:20.477
Now your daughter on the other
hand. now she is talented.

1259
01:29:22.079 --> 01:29:24.814
I'm going to invest in her
singing career.

1260
01:29:25.482 --> 01:29:27.484
I'm gonna be her first big
break.

1261
01:29:48.972 --> 01:29:52.409
When I was a kid.
my mama had this dog.

1262
01:29:52.443 --> 01:29:54.545
it was a little poodle named
Sammy.

1263
01:29:54.578 --> 01:29:55.979
She loved that dog. right?

1264
01:29:57.181 --> 01:29:59.049
He used to do all kind a tricks
like

1265
01:29:59.083 --> 01:30:01.618
walk on his hind legs.
spin around in circles.

1266
01:30:01.652 --> 01:30:03.987
You know. all that cute
little poodle shit.

1267
01:30:05.522 --> 01:30:07.024
Then one day my mama was walking
him

1268
01:30:07.057 --> 01:30:08.525
and she ran into this pit bull.

1269
01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:12.296
It looked mean but she gave
it the benefit of the doubt

1270
01:30:12.329 --> 01:30:15.399
and she put her hand out to
pet it and it growled at her.

1271
01:30:16.633 --> 01:30:19.303
Well little Sammy.

1272
01:30:19.336 --> 01:30:20.537
he wanted to protect her from
that pit.

1273
01:30:20.571 --> 01:30:23.173
So he started barking
at it and that was all

1274
01:30:23.207 --> 01:30:25.376
it took for that pit to put
little Sammy on his back.

1275
01:30:25.409 --> 01:30:27.478
wrap his jaw around his neck and
kill him.

1276
01:30:29.012 --> 01:30:30.647
Mama didn't do nothing about it.

1277
01:30:30.681 --> 01:30:32.882
She thought maybe it was Sammy's
fault.

1278
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:34.951
He shouldn't have barked.

1279
01:30:36.053 --> 01:30:37.954
Is this it?

1280
01:30:37.988 --> 01:30:40.324
Yeah. that's him right there.

1281
01:30:44.061 --> 01:30:45.562
Hey man. you're the
groom?

1282
01:30:47.131 --> 01:30:48.132
Congratulations.

1283
01:30:57.141 --> 01:30:59.576
One day my neighbor's
pit bull came up missing.

1284
01:31:03.013 --> 01:31:05.948
We came out front. calling his
name.

1285
01:31:05.983 --> 01:31:06.949
yelling down the street.

1286
01:31:10.454 --> 01:31:13.424
Everybody was so concerned
about this pit bull

1287
01:31:13.457 --> 01:31:15.459
not 'cause they felt bad for the
neighbor

1288
01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:18.061
but really they didn't
want that dog wreaking

1289
01:31:18.095 --> 01:31:21.632
any more havoc on anybody
in the neighborhood.

1290
01:32:31.635 --> 01:32:34.171
What they didn't know is I had
to put that dog down myself.
