"The gummy with its own
special blend of multivitamins

32
00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:53.610
guaranteed to lower
your cholesterol."

33
00:02:53.645 --> 00:02:56.206
-Yeah?
-So. unfortunately.

34
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:58.780
the FDA
has very strict guidelines

35
00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:01.519
on what we can and can't say
when it comes to supplements.

36
00:03:01.554 --> 00:03:04.258
-Okay. what did I say?
-"Guaranteed"

37
00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:06.051
Our products haven't been
clinically tested.

38
00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:08.020
so we can't guarantee that
they'll do anything-

39
00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:10.462
-Okay. so change it.
-Right. yes. absolutely.

40
00:03:10.497 --> 00:03:13.300
And then also. this line:
"lowers your cholesterol".

41
00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:15.192
We can't say that either.

42
00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:16.765
The best we could
say something like.

43
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.470
"it promotes healthy
cholesterol levels".

44
00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:21.770
That doesn't sound hard.
Just put that in.

45
00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:23.277
Great. Right.

48
00:03:27.316 --> 00:03:29.712

49
00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:32.484
"This statement

59

we gotta phase it out.

60
00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:05.143
But when we do.
we're going to be ready

61
00:04:05.178 --> 00:04:09.851
to roll with Power Dawn B-16!

62
00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:11.853
Now. the lab guys
think that they switched out

63
00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:13.624
the right enzyme.
so hopefully.

64
00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.022
we should be able to pick up
right where we left off.

65
00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:19.190
But. in the meantime.
we gotta put everything out

66
00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:20.862
for Power Dawn
like it's a new product.

67
00:04:20.897 --> 00:04:24.470
But when all this shit
is done.

68
00:04:24.505 --> 00:04:27.968

coming down the pipeline:

69
00:04:28.003 --> 00:04:31.543

73

74

75

00:09:47.993 --> 00:09:50.389
-Anne. baby. I am so sorry-
-No. just get out!

179
00:09:54.835 --> 00:09:56.329
That must have been hard
for you.

180
00:10:13.315 --> 00:10:15.887
I said that must
have been hard for you.

181
00:10:15.922 --> 00:10:17.449

182
00:10:17.484 --> 00:10:22.388
-And?
-Why am I talking to you?

183
00:10:22.423 --> 00:10:24.522
It's just good to talk things
through sometimes.

184
00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:26.832
No. why am I talking to you?

185
00:10:26.867 --> 00:10:29.626
Why am I talking
to a psychiatrist?

186
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:31.199
Also. they took my phone.

187
00:10:31.234 --> 00:10:32.904
Are they even
allowed to do that?

188
00:10:32.939 --> 00:10:34.499
There was just
a few details leading up

189
00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:36.303
to your injury
that I need to clarify.

190
00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:40.076
Right. okay.
I have a sprained ankle.

191
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:43.145
I don't really understand
what you think I'm holding back.

192
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.048
That's what
we'll find out together.

193
00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:48.183
That's the shrinkiest thing
I've ever heard anyone say.

194
00:10:48.218 --> 00:10:51.054
Look. is there...

195
00:10:51.089 --> 00:10:54.090
I don't know.
maybe someone else

196
00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:57.060
with a similar name that the
hospital's got me confused with?

197
00:10:57.095 --> 00:10:58.930
-What like 'Jan'. you mean?
-Well. I don't know.

198
00:10:58.965 --> 00:11:01.526
I came in for a simple
injury and next thing I know

199
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:03.363
I'm talking
to the hospital therapist.

200
00:11:03.398 --> 00:11:05.101
A simple injury.

201
00:11:05.136 --> 00:11:07.037
Can you--?
Please don't do that?

202
00:11:07.072 --> 00:11:08.742
The. the repeating.

203
00:11:10.075 --> 00:11:12.405
Okay. I won't.

204
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.847
Yes. syndesmosis.

205
00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:17.113

That's day surgery.

206
00:11:17.148 --> 00:11:20.710
Let's get back to your break-up.

207
00:11:20.745 --> 00:11:22.954
No.
How on Earth is that relevant?

208
00:11:22.989 --> 00:11:24.582
Maybe it is.
Maybe it isn't.

209
00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:27.926
Okay. that is even worse

210
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:30.929

211

212
00:11:34.836 --> 00:11:36.836

213
00:11:43.438 --> 00:11:46.571
Sorry. Sorry.

214
00:11:49.147 --> 00:11:50.410

215
00:11:51.512 --> 00:11:53.215
No specific question.

216
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.954
I just thought it must
have been really hard

217
00:11:55.989 --> 00:11:58.088
to find your boyfriend
with another woman.

218
00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:01.652
Yeah.
Yes. it was.

219
00:12:02.688 --> 00:12:06.998
So how did you respond
after Greg had moved out?

220
00:12:07.033 --> 00:12:09.594
I don't know.
I dealt with it.

221
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:13.939
I had a drink. went
for a run. got on with my life.

222
00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:17.338
I threw myself into my work.

223
00:12:17.373 --> 00:12:20.440
So. the woman
in Arkansas died.

224
00:12:20.475 --> 00:12:22.244
Mm. God.

225
00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:24.180
But. hey.
she had a good life. you know.

226
00:12:24.215 --> 00:12:26.919
and the lawyers have released
us from all responsibility.

227
00:12:26.954 --> 00:12:30.791

-Any questions?
-Um...

232
00:12:40.363 --> 00:12:42.363
-Annie.
-Oh. it's Anne.

233
00:12:42.398 --> 00:12:45.696
Ah. sorry. I had a girlfriend
in high school named Annie.

234
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.335
You look a bit like her.

235
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.271
Um. I actually had
a question about Pro-Lig.

236
00:12:49.306 --> 00:12:51.009
Now you're talking.

237
00:12:51.044 --> 00:12:53.011
Now. I know
we're not there yet.

238
00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:55.310
but I've been thinking about
some of our marketing angles.

239
00:12:55.345 --> 00:12:56.773
Yes. absolutely.

240
00:12:56.808 --> 00:12:58.676
When we get
to the email campaign.

241
00:12:58.711 --> 00:13:00.348
I really wanna nail
that grandparent demographic.

242
00:13:00.383 --> 00:13:02.350
Right. exactly.

243
00:13:02.385 --> 00:13:04.715
So. this is gonna sound a bit
outside of our comfort zone.

244
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.992
but I think that we can make
a social media play.

245
00:13:07.027 --> 00:13:08.895
Facebook hasn't filtered
spam the same way

246
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.392
that email has. so someone could
see an ad for a supplement

247
00:13:11.427 --> 00:13:13.361
and think that it's targeted
specifically towards them.

248
00:13:13.396 --> 00:13:15.198
They might not even think of it
as advertising.

249
00:13:15.233 --> 00:13:17.365
I don't know.
80-year-olds on Facebook?

250
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.334
The stats
are surprisingly encouraging.

251
00:13:19.369 --> 00:13:21.402
Ah. direct mail
and email has always

252
00:13:21.437 --> 00:13:24.174
been our honeypot
with these older folks. Annie.

253
00:13:24.209 --> 00:13:26.473
Hey. my grandfather's 90
and he's on Instagram.

254
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.883
I mean.
he has no clue how it works.

255
00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:32.248
but that's how he sees pictures
of his friends.

256
00:13:32.283 --> 00:13:33.711
Oh-ho. I love that.

257
00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:37.253
That's a really great example.

258
00:13:37.288 --> 00:13:39.717
Um. now. Instagram doesn't have
quite the same penetration

259
00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.928
in the 75-plus demo
as Facebook does--

260
00:13:41.963 --> 00:13:43.721
Instagram.
Facebook. whatever.

261
00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:45.822

people this way. right?

-Yes. sir. we can.
-Great. Let's do it.

-Great. Get me all the data.

00:26:51.752 --> 00:26:54.984
or imagined they felt better.
It's a whole thing.

526
00:26:55.019 --> 00:26:56.348
Anyway. whatever.
it's a job.

527
00:26:56.383 --> 00:26:57.789
-It's a job.
-Yep.

528
00:26:57.824 --> 00:26:59.956
-It's a job.
-Hey. cheers.

529
00:26:59.991 --> 00:27:01.386
-To new love.
-Oh. boy.

530
00:27:01.421 --> 00:27:02.860
-And to old love.
-Mm.

531
00:27:02.895 --> 00:27:04.994
And to fucking
on a private beach!

532
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:06.655
Sorry.

533
00:27:08.428 --> 00:27:10.835
I wish you could bottle
that early feeling

534
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.398
when you just want
the other person all the time.

535
00:27:13.433 --> 00:27:15.400
Everything they do turns
you on.

536
00:27:15.435 --> 00:27:18.777
Even thinking about them
makes you smile like a goof.

537
00:27:27.117 --> 00:27:29.480
You're staring at me.

538
00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:31.020
Yeah.

539
00:27:31.055 --> 00:27:32.923
You like the way I wash dishes?

540
00:27:32.958 --> 00:27:35.354
I kind of like
everything you do.

541
00:27:39.767 --> 00:27:41.690
Mm. Mm. Hello.

542
00:27:43.232 --> 00:27:44.429
Love this guy.

543
00:27:55.277 --> 00:27:58.575
But that early feeling
doesn't last. does it?

544
00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.676
Which is totally normal. right?

545
00:28:00.711 --> 00:28:02.381
Oh. of course. of course.

546
00:28:03.483 --> 00:28:07.419
When did the new relationship
shine start to fade?

547
00:28:35.988 --> 00:28:38.714
Hey. what you doing there?

548
00:28:38.749 --> 00:28:40.925
Hmm?

549
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.092
Oh.
Words with Buddies.

550
00:28:43.127 --> 00:28:44.555
What is that?

551
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.656
It's kind of like Scrabble.

552
00:28:46.691 --> 00:28:48.559
but with subtle differences
to avoid copyright issues.

553
00:28:48.594 --> 00:28:51.298
Ah. you playing against someone?

554
00:28:51.333 --> 00:28:53.432
Yeah. Alan G-77.

555
00:28:53.467 --> 00:28:55.632
Alan?

556
00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:58.844
I don't know. the game assigns
people randomly. but he's good.

557
00:28:58.879 --> 00:29:00.670
I'm only up by two points.

558
00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:03.607
Can I see?

559
00:29:03.642 --> 00:29:04.949
Hmm?

560
00:29:04.984 --> 00:29:06.951
Here. let me see.

561
00:29:06.986 --> 00:29:10.317
Jesus. how do you use
this thing?

562
00:29:10.352 --> 00:29:12.451
Um. I squint mostly.

563
00:29:13.993 --> 00:29:15.487
I know
a great screen-repair guy.

564
00:29:15.522 --> 00:29:17.588
Can get you another
one for 100 bucks.

565
00:29:17.623 --> 00:29:19.931
Thank you.
but I can't really afford that.

566
00:29:19.966 --> 00:29:22.692
Oh. forget it.
I got you.

567
00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:26.300
Mm.
Ah. This is easy.

568
00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:29.842
-"Mall"?
-Six points.

569
00:29:29.877 --> 00:29:32.878
Yeah. but there's a triple word
score that I was trying to use.

570
00:29:32.913 --> 00:29:35.606
Uch. of course.
he just used it.

571
00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:38.543
Okay.
Well. find a better word.

572
00:29:38.578 --> 00:29:40.512
No. it's okay.
I can do it.

573
00:29:40.547 --> 00:29:43.889
Come on. we'll do it together.

574
00:29:43.924 --> 00:29:47.453
How about this?

575
00:29:47.488 --> 00:29:50.995
"Style."
Yeah. that's good.

576
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.326
Mm.

577
00:29:57.498 --> 00:29:59.872
Mm. So how are things
with you and Tom?

578
00:29:59.907 --> 00:30:01.203
Yeah. they're good.

579
00:30:01.238 --> 00:30:02.831
Yeah. How's the sex?

580
00:30:02.866 --> 00:30:04.305
Kiara.

581
00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.735
What?
They're a couple.

582
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.572
They're having sex.

583
00:30:07.607 --> 00:30:09.475
Presumably. they have
coffee from time to time too.

584
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:11.015
I'm very happy to talk
about coffee.

585
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.248
Okay. great.

586
00:30:13.283 --> 00:30:15.745
So. last night. while Mitch
and I were having coffee.

587
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.483
I put a ball-gag in his mouth

588
00:30:17.518 --> 00:30:19.023
and I whipped him
like a racehorse.

589
00:30:19.058 --> 00:30:20.387
Oh. jeeze.
Oh. please. you love it.

590
00:30:20.422 --> 00:30:21.850
I do.

591
00:30:21.885 --> 00:30:23.720
So. it's good?

592
00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:26.558
Not just the sex.
Tom.

593
00:30:26.593 --> 00:30:29.198
The whole package.
not just the package.

594
00:30:29.233 --> 00:30:31.761
Yeah. Tom is great.
He's amazing.

595
00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:33.829
So is the package.

596
00:30:33.864 --> 00:30:35.369
Yes.

597
00:30:40.981 --> 00:30:43.278
Hey. Dougie.

598
00:30:43.313 --> 00:30:46.644
Can he call you in an hour?

599
00:30:48.483 --> 00:30:50.186
Thanks. hon.

600
00:30:50.221 --> 00:30:52.584
So. you guys just use
each other's phones?

601
00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:54.883
Yeah. of course.
Mitch has nothing to hide.

602
00:30:54.918 --> 00:30:57.259
Oh. cut or uncut?

603
00:30:57.294 --> 00:30:59.261
I need to know these things.

604
00:31:02.926 --> 00:31:06.235
The buzz is fucking building.
people.

605
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.534
I'm telling you.
the focus groups were great.

606
00:31:08.569 --> 00:31:11.867
And the bean counters
found an extra $40.000

607
00:31:11.902 --> 00:31:13.407
for the social media strategies.

608
00:31:13.442 --> 00:31:15.739
Now let's talk color schemes.

609
00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:17.543
Um. actually. Mr. McKay.

610
00:31:17.578 --> 00:31:19.985
I have a copy suggestion I
wanted to share with the group.

611
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.550
So I was thinking of opening
with "Sick of joint pain?"

612
00:31:24.585 --> 00:31:26.156
But I think now
I'm actually gonna go with

613
00:31:26.191 --> 00:31:28.092
"Tired of joint pain?"

614
00:31:28.127 --> 00:31:30.292
because we're not
claiming to cure sickness.

615
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:33.724
We are simply offering
an alternative to being

616
00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:36.232
weighed down by the chronic
aches and pains

617
00:31:36.267 --> 00:31:38.399
that folks of this age
suffer from every day.

618
00:31:38.434 --> 00:31:39.829
It's a tiny shift.
but I think

619
00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:41.402
it will subtly change
how people read it.

620
00:31:41.437 --> 00:31:43.943
Hey. if it sells more pills.

621
00:31:44.968 --> 00:31:46.308
Shawn. what do you think?

622
00:31:46.343 --> 00:31:48.640
-Oh. yeah. that could work.
-Great.

623
00:31:48.675 --> 00:31:49.938
Incorporate it into the copy.

624
00:31:49.973 --> 00:31:51.841
-You got it.
-Anything else? Okay. great.

625
00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:52.842
Wait. sir. I thought
I was writing the copy.

626
00:31:54.483 --> 00:31:55.878
You?

627
00:31:57.024 --> 00:31:58.386
You did?

628
00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:01.818
You're the copy editor.
Anne.

629
00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:03.996
You edit the copy.

630
00:32:04.031 --> 00:32:05.690
And. and you're great at it.

631
00:32:07.826 --> 00:32:09.892
Sir. you told me
to run point on this.

632
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.039
Oh. I meant the research.

633
00:32:14.074 --> 00:32:17.867
you know. all that Facebook
stuff you were talking about.

634
00:32:17.902 --> 00:32:19.836
-You did that. right?
-Yeah.

635
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:22.212
And. Shawn. you've been
working on the copy. right?

636
00:32:22.247 --> 00:32:25.985
-Yeah.
-Make the exchange.

637
00:32:29.155 --> 00:32:32.651
Good teamwork.
that's good teamwork.

638
00:32:32.686 --> 00:32:34.455

Yeah. no shit.

643
00:32:46.403 --> 00:32:48.205
I finally thought
we were getting somewhere.

I.

646
00:32:51.507 --> 00:32:53.078
What did I say?
"We"?

647
00:32:53.113 --> 00:32:56.180
Sure there's some
psychological reason for that.

648
00:32:56.215 --> 00:32:58.215
Maybe.

649
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:00.382
You were in a new relationship.
but doubts had started

650
00:33:00.417 --> 00:33:02.384
to creep in about it.
about the two of you.

651
00:33:02.419 --> 00:33:04.056
"We."

652
00:33:04.091 --> 00:33:06.718
Right.

653
00:33:06.753 --> 00:33:10.018
Do you make
a good living at your job?

654
00:33:10.053 --> 00:33:12.724
I can pay my bills.

655
00:33:12.759 --> 00:33:14.396
Easily?

656
00:33:14.431 --> 00:33:17.663
I mean. no. not easily.

657
00:33:17.698 --> 00:33:20.732
An opportunity for advancement
at your work doesn't pan out.

658
00:33:20.767 --> 00:33:22.866
but you've met this new fella
who's very generous

659
00:33:22.901 --> 00:33:24.901
with his money.
Maybe you felt a little trapped.

660
00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:27.772
I wasn't trapped.
I really liked Tom.

661
00:33:27.807 --> 00:33:30.346
At your job. then.

662
00:33:30.381 --> 00:33:32.777
You felt your work
wasn't respected.

663
00:33:32.812 --> 00:33:35.285
but you couldn't quit
because you needed the money.

664
00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.616
No.
I've quit jobs before.

665
00:33:36.651 --> 00:33:38.046
I always land on my feet.

Sorry. can we talk about
something else for a minute?

668
00:33:45.462 --> 00:33:48.892
I thought you were anxious

-It's a tricky case.
-Why's that?

680
00:34:42.354 --> 00:34:45.685
It's not your typical
five stages of grief.

681
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:48.083
I'm trying to get
some background info

682
00:34:48.118 --> 00:34:49.623
just so I can lead her up--

683
00:34:49.658 --> 00:34:51.856
We don't need
any background info.

684
00:34:51.891 --> 00:34:55.332
Actually. it does help to lead
her into the larger discussion.

685
00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:57.367
I wanna talk to her.

686
00:34:57.402 --> 00:35:00.128
-No.
-No?

687
00:35:00.163 --> 00:35:01.932
She's in a very fragile state.

688
00:35:01.967 --> 00:35:04.308
She barely remembers anything.

689
00:35:04.343 --> 00:35:06.035
So. push her.
Jog her memory.

690
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.476
It doesn't work that way.

691
00:35:07.511 --> 00:35:09.346
A crime
has been committed here.

692
00:35:09.381 --> 00:35:10.941
I wanna talk to the victim.

693
00:35:10.976 --> 00:35:12.976
And I'm telling you
that the victim

694
00:35:13.011 --> 00:35:14.813
doesn't even realize
there was a crime.

695
00:35:14.848 --> 00:35:17.717
She thought she was
in here for a sprained ankle.

696
00:35:17.752 --> 00:35:20.621
which has become
a broken fibula.

697
00:35:20.656 --> 00:35:22.150
-You serious?
-Swear to God.

698
00:35:22.185 --> 00:35:24.119
It's called
dissociative amnesia.

699
00:35:24.154 --> 00:35:26.627
It's very frequent
in trauma victims.

700
00:35:26.662 --> 00:35:29.201
It usually presents
as memory loss.

701
00:35:29.236 --> 00:35:31.533
