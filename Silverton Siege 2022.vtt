00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:48.083
Dammit.

4
00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.291
Don't shoot.

5
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.958
Emergency. gentlemen. Jeez.

6
00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:49.041
Go! Go MK!

7
00:04:56.708 --> 00:04:57.875
Where are you going now?

8
00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:47.708
No way…

9
00:06:13.583 --> 00:06:14.583
Homeless.

10
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:59.333
Take this street!

11
00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:19.166
Piss off! I'll kill you!

12
00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:21.125
What now?

13
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
-Let's go!
-He's trying to kill us. Move!

14
00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:54.125
You're driving right past it!

15
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.166
Reverse.

16
00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:02.208
Go in. brother!

17
00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:15.125
-Go. Masego! Let's move.
-Masego. no way man!

18
00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:55.166
Comrades. get moving.
We need to find a way out.

19
00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:05.500
Masego! Wake up!
What do you think you're doing?

20
00:09:05.583 --> 00:09:07.875
Masego. don't do this to me!

21
00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:16.208
Masego. I'm begging you.

22
00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:23.833
Hurry up. you must go.

23
00:09:23.916 --> 00:09:25.291
Quickly. go.

24
00:09:47.458 --> 00:09:49.250
Fuck you!

25
00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:55.416
Terra! We need to move!

26
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.291
I think it's Pieter!

27
00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:13.375
Pieter. are you okay?

28
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.333
Hold on. buddy. hold on.

29
00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:33.208
Hold on. they are on their way.

30
00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.291
Men. search the whole building.

31
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.708
Go up there! Every car as well.

32
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.875
Let's get out of here!

33
00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:40.583
Press. Aldo. press!

34
00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:46.458
Get out of the way!

35
00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:50.833
-Let's go. guys!
-Go!

36
00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:07.083
Let's go!

37
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:15.625
Go past!

38
00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:20.583
Keep going!

39
00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:09.958
Rabbi. get down! Down!

40
00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:11.375
Move. clear!

41
00:14:31.083 --> 00:14:32.041
Go past!

42
00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:46.625
What kind of shit is this?

43
00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:57.000
Hurry. Ma. Go!

44
00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:53.875
Gents. what are we gonna do?

45
00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:30.916
What do you think you're doing. boy?

46
00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:52.500
You didn't say he's Black.

47
00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:57.375
Johan. let him go. Johan.

48
00:18:29.916 --> 00:18:31.166
Hold fast!

49
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.250
Hold fast!

50
00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:17.625
What's this? Hello.

51
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.750
Looks like this one has issues.

52
00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:40.750
Sit down! Don't get on my nerves.

53
00:20:42.666 --> 00:20:45.083
Ladies too. Let's go.

54
00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:21.041
I know.

55
00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:34.916
How's he know our names?

56
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.541
Never mind our names.
How did he know about the mission?

57
00:22:41.375 --> 00:22:44.791
-Maybe the truck driver?
-No. All the truck driver knew

58
00:22:44.875 --> 00:22:47.458
was to meet us there
and drive us in. That's it.

59
00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:49.125
This guy knew everything.

60
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.708
Don't look at me.

61
00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:07.250
I lost Masego today. Don't piss me off.

62
00:23:07.333 --> 00:23:09.666
There were other units
where we left Masego.

63
00:23:42.041 --> 00:23:44.916
I'm Captain Langerman.
South African Police.

64
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.875
We met outside the bank.

65
00:28:53.375 --> 00:28:54.208
Let's go.

66
00:29:31.916 --> 00:29:32.916
Shoot!

67
00:29:35.833 --> 00:29:37.708
-Shoot!
-Get up!

68
00:29:42.916 --> 00:29:44.458
Shoot!

69
00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:49.291
Come out of there.
you dog. Come out!

70
00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.750
Come on. dog. Move.

71
00:29:59.541 --> 00:30:02.541
-Why aren't you shooting?
-Do not fire.

72
00:30:09.083 --> 00:30:10.833
Move. Move. dog.

73
00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:20.333
Sit down!

74
00:30:36.541 --> 00:30:38.416
We've lost the signal.

75
00:30:47.666 --> 00:30:50.125
You're a piece of crap.

76
00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:35.375
This dog nearly had us killed.

77
00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.625
Please…

78
00:31:44.125 --> 00:31:45.125
Come here.

79
00:31:50.666 --> 00:31:51.500
And now?

80
00:31:51.583 --> 00:31:52.416
Get in…

81
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.500
Let's go.

82
00:31:55.416 --> 00:31:56.666
Let's go.

83
00:31:59.916 --> 00:32:00.750
Get in.

84
00:32:00.833 --> 00:32:01.708
Get in!

85
00:32:12.708 --> 00:32:13.541
Get up.

86
00:32:27.083 --> 00:32:28.333
Talk!

87
00:32:28.416 --> 00:32:29.625
-I don't know.
-Lies!

88
00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:46.375
Go cool off.

89
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:05.416
The Little Crocodile is here.

90
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.291
The Little Crocodile is here.

91
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.791
Captain Langerman.

92
00:34:39.875 --> 00:34:41.291
Brigadier.

93
00:34:41.375 --> 00:34:44.541
The Big Crocodile is dying to see you.
And he's on the warpath.

94
00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:47.416
-Brigadier. we've been on this case--
-I'm not talking to you.

95
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.833
What's that?

96
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.416
It's a helicopter. Brigadier.

97
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.500
I know what it is. Schoeman.

98
00:34:57.458 --> 00:34:59.958
But why is it standing there?
In front of Uncle Paul?

99
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:02.166
Fix it.

100
00:35:06.625 --> 00:35:08.250
Oh. and…

101
00:35:08.333 --> 00:35:11.041
Have you seen the bank manifest?

102
00:35:14.166 --> 00:35:19.833
The Justice Minister's daughter.
Christine. is one of the hostages.

103
00:35:20.791 --> 00:35:22.125
Really. sir?

104
00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:26.875
Yes. Schoeman.

105
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.333
Really.

106
00:35:28.958 --> 00:35:30.500
That's why I'm here.

107
00:35:30.583 --> 00:35:34.583
With all the horses. the dogs.
the guns. the soldiers. and everything.

108
00:35:39.625 --> 00:35:41.250
This crap stops now.

109
00:35:41.958 --> 00:35:43.500
Do you understand me. Captain?

110
00:37:41.833 --> 00:37:43.000
What's the plan?

111
00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:31.666
Khumalo. You're starting again.

112
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.416
Let's not give them any other way.

113
00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:41.125
NOW MORE THAN 1000 000 000 STRONGER.

114
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.916
Dear Lord

115
00:40:48.416 --> 00:40:49.791
We pray to you…

116
00:42:53.958 --> 00:42:55.125
My love.

117
00:43:36.541 --> 00:43:37.750
I didn't get that.

118
00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:39.125
Calm down. please.

119
00:45:03.291 --> 00:45:04.916
Dammit.

120
00:45:56.541 --> 00:45:58.500
Khumalo. what are you doing?

121
00:45:58.583 --> 00:46:00.083
Khumalo! Talk to me.

122
00:46:26.541 --> 00:46:27.958
Aldo. my machine gun.

123
00:46:39.291 --> 00:46:40.583
Get ready.

124
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:57.458
Take them now.

125
00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:59.625
No. wait. Brigadier.
something's not right.

126
00:47:00.333 --> 00:47:02.333
There they are. standing outside.

127
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:03.833
Shoot them.

128
00:47:03.916 --> 00:47:06.833
No. one of those three
isn't one of our suspects.

129
00:47:06.916 --> 00:47:09.875
I didn't say he's one of our suspects.
I gave you an order.

130
00:47:09.958 --> 00:47:11.000
Shoot the bastards now.

131
00:47:12.166 --> 00:47:13.875
Calvin is cunning as a jackal.

132
00:47:15.208 --> 00:47:17.375
He wouldn't just expose himself like that.

133
00:47:17.458 --> 00:47:19.583
I think that man might be a hostage.

134
00:47:20.916 --> 00:47:23.083
Now you listen to me. Captain.

135
00:47:23.166 --> 00:47:24.416
I gave you an order.

136
00:49:25.333 --> 00:49:28.875
-Power to the people!
-Power to the people!

137
00:49:32.958 --> 00:49:35.458
You nearly caused
an international incident.

138
00:49:35.541 --> 00:49:37.500
That was an American hostage.

139
00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:39.916
But he's Black!

140
00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:44.958
I couldn't care less that he's American.

141
00:49:46.416 --> 00:49:47.625
Shut them up!

142
00:49:48.666 --> 00:49:52.875
Get rid of this damn disturbance.
I do not want to hear them!

143
00:50:01.291 --> 00:50:05.541
Power to the people!

144
00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:32.791
No. Khumalo.

145
00:50:39.833 --> 00:50:42.000
That bloody captain
is a piece of shit.

146
00:50:43.625 --> 00:50:44.708
I swear…

147
00:50:54.541 --> 00:50:55.458
Excuse me.

148
00:50:59.041 --> 00:51:01.791
Erasmus. please
deal with this dog before I kill him.

149
00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:21.333
Christine. you mad?
What do you think you're doing?

150
00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:14.458
Let's go.

151
00:57:07.375 --> 00:57:08.875
What are you doing?

152
00:57:46.666 --> 00:57:48.375
See you later.

153
00:57:50.583 --> 00:57:52.625
-Doesn't wanna come out.
-Why not?

154
00:59:04.708 --> 00:59:05.958
No.

155
00:59:06.583 --> 00:59:09.500
-How do you mean "No." Brigadier?
-Because I say no.

156
00:59:09.583 --> 00:59:12.750
We could use her to persuade
Christine to come out of the bank.

157
00:59:14.375 --> 00:59:16.625
Let me explain something to you both.

158
00:59:16.708 --> 00:59:19.291
You want us to turn a maid

159
00:59:19.375 --> 00:59:21.958
into a heroine on national television?

160
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:24.958
How desperate do you want us to look?

161
00:59:29.583 --> 00:59:30.416
Fuck.

162
00:59:34.833 --> 00:59:35.750
Fuck.

163
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:39.583
Captain!

164
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:42.458
If your plan doesn't work. mine will.

165
01:00:17.791 --> 01:00:19.666
Hurry up. Don't have all day.

166
01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:12.583
That's definitely shots. Go!

167
01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:21.916
Khumalo. shoot him. man!

168
01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:43.208
Get up. dog.

169
01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:59.083
Terra. let me have a look…

170
01:01:59.166 --> 01:02:00.250
I'm all right.

171
01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:48.750
Not now. man.

172
01:08:05.208 --> 01:08:07.291
Pastor. I'm doing my best.

173
01:10:00.375 --> 01:10:01.416
Dog.

174
01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.125
Khumalo. what does he want in here?

175
01:10:21.166 --> 01:10:22.458
Don't stress. Terra.

176
01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:49.625
People outside
are worried about you.

177
01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:51.916
Come with me. please.

178
01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:54.541
No.

179
01:11:50.083 --> 01:11:51.583
Terra. what are you doing?

180
01:14:23.083 --> 01:14:24.458
Terra. what did you do?

181
01:14:29.125 --> 01:14:30.875
I should shoot you in the head.

182
01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:43.416
I agree. Honorable Minister.

183
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:45.583
Yes.

184
01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:47.666
Naturally.

185
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:49.791
I will make absolutely sure of it.

186
01:15:51.291 --> 01:15:53.083
Thank you. Honorable Minister.

187
01:16:05.291 --> 01:16:06.541
Get ready to breach.

188
01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:08.541
What? What about the hostages?

189
01:16:08.625 --> 01:16:10.458
-No longer important.
-Brigadier…

190
01:16:11.041 --> 01:16:13.541
One of them just died. They're vulnerable.

191
01:16:13.625 --> 01:16:15.375
They could surrender. Brigadier.

192
01:16:15.458 --> 01:16:17.250
We can find a peaceful solution.

193
01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:19.583
You think that after
what happened in there

194
01:16:19.666 --> 01:16:21.125
that you can convince him?

195
01:16:21.208 --> 01:16:22.875
When I was in the bank

196
01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:26.625
I saw a man
who wasn't prepared to pull the trigger.

197
01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:30.708
He could have kept me hostage
but he didn't. Why?

198
01:16:31.833 --> 01:16:36.208
I think this whole situation.
the violence. the murder

199
01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:37.791
it's consuming him.

200
01:16:38.416 --> 01:16:42.916
You want me to believe
that damn terrorist in there

201
01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.250
is a good man?

202
01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:45.375
No.

203
01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:47.291
What I'm saying

204
01:16:47.375 --> 01:16:49.291
is that Calvin Khumalo

205
01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:51.625
is fighting for justice.

206
01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:54.916
And he doesn't want to lose more people.

207
01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:57.041
And that's

208
01:16:58.291 --> 01:16:59.666
your problem.

209
01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.791
You think that trash in there

210
01:17:03.541 --> 01:17:04.500
are people.

211
01:17:11.375 --> 01:17:12.458
Out!

212
01:18:30.541 --> 01:18:33.166
We are only human
through other human beings.

213
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:36.125
We are only human
through other human beings.

214
01:20:10.458 --> 01:20:12.291
Think of your family.

215
01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:15.166
Of your father. Please.

216
01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:16.166
Father.

217
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:17.958
Please. Father. I implore you.

218
01:20:18.041 --> 01:20:19.500
I know you can see me.

219
01:20:19.583 --> 01:20:21.000
Do what they ask. Please.

220
01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:22.375
Do the right thing.

221
01:20:51.083 --> 01:20:53.041
Officers. come and fetch this woman.

222
01:21:00.208 --> 01:21:01.250
Stand down.

223
01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:03.041
Stand down.

224
01:21:46.083 --> 01:21:48.250
Come on. Christine. Come on.

225
01:22:46.416 --> 01:22:48.666
It's a matter of national security.

226
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:49.916
Come with me.

227
01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:53.416
I'm tired.

228
01:23:58.458 --> 01:23:59.375
I know.

229
01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.875
I know.

230
01:24:12.916 --> 01:24:15.125
Don't let them worry you.

231
01:24:15.208 --> 01:24:16.708
You did the right thing.

232
01:24:17.708 --> 01:24:20.208
-We'll look after you. soldier.
-Thank you. Brigadier.

233
01:24:20.833 --> 01:24:21.916
Dismissed.

234
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.875
Khumalo. you have a phone call.

235
01:29:13.875 --> 01:29:14.916
Thank you.

236
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.041
Langerman. go home.

237
01:30:00.125 --> 01:30:02.083
Spend some time with your wife.

238
01:30:02.166 --> 01:30:03.875
That's an order.

239
01:30:04.875 --> 01:30:06.708
Because you are now done.

240
01:30:40.166 --> 01:30:41.208
Move in.

241
01:30:58.375 --> 01:30:59.333
Father!

242
01:31:08.208 --> 01:31:11.333
We kill dogs!

243
01:31:20.333 --> 01:31:22.375
Fuck you!

244
01:31:30.291 --> 01:31:32.041
This will be easy!

245
01:31:52.666 --> 01:31:54.250
Bastards!

246
01:31:59.416 --> 01:32:00.750
We showed them.

247
01:32:00.833 --> 01:32:02.583
We showed those dogs.

248
01:32:07.375 --> 01:32:09.666
-We made them dance.
-Yeah.

249
01:32:11.708 --> 01:32:13.916
You know those dogs got me.

250
01:32:16.666 --> 01:32:17.958
This is just a graze.

251
01:32:50.500 --> 01:32:51.500
Hold fast.

252
01:32:52.875 --> 01:32:53.875
Hold fast.

253
01:32:56.666 --> 01:32:57.791
Dammit.

254
01:32:59.875 --> 01:33:01.291
Get ready to go in.
