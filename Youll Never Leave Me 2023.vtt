And I think I'm just afraid of
losing everyone I care about.

364
00:17:06.443 --> 00:17:08.901

that happened is my fault

just closing in.

I just can't seem to
move past that. you know?

But we never really got
a chance to say goodbye.

comfortable with you.

explain it. but...

it. and sometimes not so much.

that all the time.

"you live and learn."

518
00:26:05.898 --> 00:26:07.606
Well. it's a pretty
old expression.

519

I'm sure a lot
of people use it.

520
00:26:10.278 --> 00:26:10.985
God. I'm sorry.

521
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:15.297
I need to move on. [chuckles]

522

It just...

523
00:26:15.992 --> 00:26:17.616
It seems so inhuman.

always something there

"take it on the chin.
sit up straight.

528
00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:28.002
And don't let
anybody see you cry."

He died when I was a kid.

530

Mom.

735

May I come in? I
bought us some goodies.

736

I meant on the phone.

I guess I thought it'd be
better to do so in person.

each other at all since...

call from the school.

to run by there.

you think I should do?

is that you sue for divorce.

walk again. but he'll live.

Well. that's good.

828
00:41:36.369 --> 00:41:39.403
But my advice is that you
consider the possibility

829
00:41:39.623 --> 00:41:42.573
That he may take up
with ms. Cook again.

830

I won't let that
happen. mr. Challis.

I'm going to do my best
to take care of him

To bring him back to me.

833

will be happy again.

was back at the restaurant

When we first met!

1429
01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:05.679
Yes.

1430
01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:07.573
Did you follow me
there from work?

1431
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.391
Yes.

1432
01:18:08.643 --> 01:18:10.743
So you've been stalking
her since day one.

1433
01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:12.728
It's not like that. It's...

1434
01:18:12.939 --> 01:18:14.580
It's much. much worse.

1435
01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:16.707
But I cannot tell you
right now. not yet.

1436
01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:18.600
You're gonna hate me
when find it all out.

1437
01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:21.754
But right now we've got
to get out of here. April.

1438
01:18:21.823 --> 01:18:22.438
We've gotta go to the police.

1439
01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:23.847
And I will tell them everything.

1440
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:24.514
Police?

1441
01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:25.474
Yes. I will confess.

1442
01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:27.042
I'll tell them what susan did.

1443
01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.703
I'll tell them what we both did.

1444
01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:32.039
I'll tell them about
marie and kathy.

1446
01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:36.310
It's susan.

1447
01:18:36.504 --> 01:18:38.804
She's out of control now. and
she's not gonna stop until-

1449

that was your mom?

1458
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.613
[April] yes.

1459
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.075
Is she coming over here?

1460
01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.120
No. no. she's out of town.

1461
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:13.580

I called. but you
didn't answer.

1482

I didn't answer because I
don't want you to be here!

can to make it right.
