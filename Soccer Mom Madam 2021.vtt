have to give them.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.662
[man] Assume he's a cop.

191
00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:16.630
Send him to room four.
Joy loves cops.

192
00:08:16.664 --> 00:08:18.131
She does. She loves cops.

193
00:08:18.165 --> 00:08:19.833
-Okay.
Lesson one.

194
00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:21.602
No amount of money
is worth your freedom.

195
00:08:21.635 --> 00:08:24.605
-Okay.
-Oof. Ain't that the truth.

196
00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:26.073
Anna. I'm Arthur.

197
00:08:26.106 --> 00:08:26.807
Hi. Nice to meet you.

198
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.742
Call me Art.
Nice to meet you.

199
00:08:28.776 --> 00:08:29.577
He's my accountant and lawyer.

200
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.845
Extraordinaire.

201
00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:32.646
Okay.

202
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.681
I keep this place
on the up and up.

203
00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:37.217
so if you have any questions.
don't hesitate.

204
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.285
I'm around here all the time.

205
00:08:38.318 --> 00:08:39.452
All the time.

206
00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:39.953
-Okay. good. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you. too.

207
00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.122
I like her. Letty.

208
00:08:42.155 --> 00:08:43.290
Thursday?

209
00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:45.125
[Anna] Okay. do how do you...

210
00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:45.959
Don't make me miss you.

211
00:08:45.993 --> 00:08:47.327
[Anna] Do you want
stickers. or...

212
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.729
Thursday.

213
00:08:49.697 --> 00:08:51.331
[hushed exchange. indistinct]

214
00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.133
Are you the cousin?

215
00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:55.769
Hey. I'm Anna.

216
00:08:55.803 --> 00:08:58.972
Welcome to the family. mamacita.

217
00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:00.708
Bethany! Marjie!

218
00:09:00.741 --> 00:09:01.341
Get your asses in here
and say hi to the new girl.

219
00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.610
I'm Tina.

220
00:09:02.643 --> 00:09:04.678
Nice to meet you.

221
00:09:04.712 --> 00:09:05.613
-This is Marjie.
-Pleasure to meet you.

222
00:09:05.646 --> 00:09:07.581
-Bethany.
-Hi. I'm Bethany.

223
00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:10.083
-Lovely to meet you.
-Anna.

224
00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:12.653
Okay. all right. everybody.
back to work. back to work.

225
00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:13.687
We'll talk later.
You got kids?

226
00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:14.622
I have two.

227
00:09:14.655 --> 00:09:16.624
I got kids!
We should hang out. Call me.

228
00:09:16.657 --> 00:09:17.891
I'll teach you
everything I know.

229
00:09:17.925 --> 00:09:19.026
-After work.
-All right.

230
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.028
Anna.

231
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:21.328
This is where
you're gonna start. okay?

232
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:23.731
Yeah.

233
00:09:23.764 --> 00:09:26.867
Restrooms. Massage room
one. two. three. and four.

234
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.235
[Anna] I thought I'd hate it.

235
00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:28.936
but would you believe it--

236
00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:30.370
I found something I was good at.

237
00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:33.240
Tina and Bethany
available at that 11:00 time.

238
00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:34.708
I made it my business

239
00:09:34.742 --> 00:09:35.643
to know everything
about everyone--

240
00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:38.311
both the girls
and the clients.

241
00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:39.346
Birthdays. anniversaries.

242
00:09:39.379 --> 00:09:41.314
kids' names.
places of employment.

243
00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:44.852
I updated our scheduling system
so it ran without a hitch.

244
00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:48.856
Girls. I'm having
a dry cleaning.

245
00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:50.991
[Anna] Letty employed them.
but it was more than that.

246
00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:51.925
They needed someone
in their life

247
00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:53.093
to take care of them.

248
00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:56.396
They'd been abused.
abandoned. and let down.

249
00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:57.397
They needed family
and friends...

250
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.366
and so did I.

251
00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.901
-Sit. Have one.

252
00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:06.006
* Happy birthday to you

253
00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:08.275
[Anna] I took care of them
and they took care of me.

254
00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:08.709
We were in it together.

255
00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:10.410
* ...Tina

256
00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.679
Make a wish!

257
00:10:11.712 --> 00:10:14.014
[blowing]

258
00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:16.383
[cheering]

259
00:10:18.051 --> 00:10:19.252
[smooch]

260
00:10:19.286 --> 00:10:20.220
Deep thoughts. kiddo?

261
00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:23.691
How much longer
do we have to stay here?

262
00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:26.694
This bed is way too small
for three people.

263
00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:28.195
We'll get our own place

264
00:10:28.228 --> 00:10:31.331
as soon as I've got
enough money saved up. Okay?

265
00:10:31.364 --> 00:10:32.332
Okay.

266
00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:34.968
I got a plan.

267
00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:35.435
Mm.

268
00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.404
I love you.

269
00:10:37.437 --> 00:10:38.906
Love you. too.

270
00:10:38.939 --> 00:10:40.240
Try to get some sleep. okay?

271
00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:42.109
-Okay.
-Okay.

272
00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:47.047
[**]

273
00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:51.819
You've never seen so much
complaining in your life.

274
00:10:51.852 --> 00:10:54.021
It's a nightmare.
I'm telling you.

275
00:10:54.054 --> 00:10:55.288
Hello.

276
00:10:56.456 --> 00:11:00.193
Ohh. I'd really hoped we'd seen
the last of "Enema Man".

277
00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:01.194
"Enema Man"?

278
00:11:01.228 --> 00:11:02.930
What's--
What's that even mean?

279
00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:05.665
[laughs] Well... you'll see.

280
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.069
Um. can I show you guys
something?

281
00:11:09.102 --> 00:11:09.803
Although we were
all making money.

282
00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:11.805
we weren't making enough.

283
00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:12.940
and I wanted better
for myself.

284
00:11:12.973 --> 00:11:14.808
the girls. and my kids.

285
00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:16.910
Okay. so.
I was going over the books--

286
00:11:16.944 --> 00:11:17.711
Who told you to do that?

287
00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:20.914
No one. I was just
trying to help

288
00:11:20.948 --> 00:11:22.783
and thinking about how
to increase profit margins.

289
00:11:22.816 --> 00:11:23.884
Good on you.
Let's hear it.

290
00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:26.854
Okay. So. we do great business
on Saturdays. right?

291
00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:27.955
Between 4:00 and 9:00.

292
00:11:27.988 --> 00:11:30.891
we make anywhere between
$800 to $1.500. on average.

293
00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:32.325
but we're still
competing against

294
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:33.493
every other massage parlor
on the street--

295
00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:36.329
-there's six. by the way.
-I'm aware.

296
00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:38.398
But. on Sundays.
only Big Freddie's is open.

297
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:39.166
and that's from 10:00 to 2:00.

298
00:11:39.199 --> 00:11:41.268
So we could open
from noon to 6:00

299
00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:41.802
and charge a premium.

300
00:11:41.835 --> 00:11:43.937
If business is good.

301
00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:47.007
I mean. we could increase
our weekly profits by 30%.

302
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.141
"Our"?

303
00:11:48.175 --> 00:11:48.842
Your.

304
00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:49.977
I like it.

305
00:11:51.278 --> 00:11:52.312
I don't.

306
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.148
Wait. Why not?

307
00:11:55.182 --> 00:11:57.785
You get greedy.
you get pinched.

308
00:11:57.818 --> 00:11:59.987
It's not greed. it's...
it's expansion.

309
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.089
Don't ask me again.

310
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.392
Hmm. I'll talk to her.

311
00:12:05.425 --> 00:12:07.294
Speaking of expansion--

312
00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:09.863
you might want to grab
an extra bottle of bleach.

313
00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:11.865
Why?

314
00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:12.766
[Anna] Enema man--

315
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.802
so this was my life.

316
00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:16.469
I was as far away
from the American Dream

317
00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:17.070
as I could get.

318
00:12:17.104 --> 00:12:18.839
[Tina] They're so cute.

319
00:12:18.872 --> 00:12:21.074
[both chuckling]

320
00:12:21.108 --> 00:12:22.042
Mira.

321
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.310
[Anna] Is that Marjie?

322
00:12:23.343 --> 00:12:24.845
Hey. Marjie!

323
00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:26.579
Oh.

324
00:12:26.613 --> 00:12:28.548
Well...

325
00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:31.084
I guess she's too fancy
for us now.

326
00:12:31.118 --> 00:12:32.886
Enema Man
was her breaking point.

327
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.321
I don't get it.

328
00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:37.424
There's what I do
at the parlor--

329
00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:39.026
$40 to $60 a pop--

330
00:12:39.059 --> 00:12:41.161
then there's what she does now.

331
00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:43.263
How much?

332
00:12:43.296 --> 00:12:44.431
Thousand an hour?

333
00:12:44.464 --> 00:12:45.933
-What?
-Minimum.

334
00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:48.201
Maybe more.
She's "A"-list now.

335
00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:49.837
I was making
that kind of cash.

336
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.205
I would leave my Hector
tomorrow.

337
00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:54.007
He gets so emotional.
you know?

338
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:56.043
Maybe I could go
back to school.

339
00:12:56.076 --> 00:12:57.811
Put some savings away
for the kids.

340
00:12:57.845 --> 00:12:58.578
Hmm.

341
00:12:58.611 --> 00:13:01.381
Buy a few
investment properties.

342
00:13:01.414 --> 00:13:03.183
like a real boss.

343
00:13:03.216 --> 00:13:05.252
What's going on
in that brain of yours?

344
00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:07.554
[Anna chuckles quietly]

345
00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.926
[singing quietly. indistinct]

346
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.261
[buzzer blares]

347
00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:16.263
[blaring]

348
00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:21.835
Hi. Do you have an appointment?

349
00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:24.137
I. uh...

350
00:13:24.171 --> 00:13:25.605
-What's your name?
-Is Tina here?

351
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.941
I actually sent her out
to run a few errands--

352
00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:28.575
[loudly] I know she's here!

353
00:13:28.608 --> 00:13:30.844
I can smell her perfume!

354
00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:33.847
I know she's with someone.

355
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:34.781
I know what she does.

356
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:38.518
Okay. She is one of
our best masseuses.

357
00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:39.552
Is she with someone now?

358
00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:40.620
I want to see her! And him!

359
00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:42.322
Out here! Right now!

360
00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:43.323
Okay.

361
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:45.893
Whoa.

362
00:13:45.926 --> 00:13:47.861
Tina!

363
00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:49.997
Tina! Come out here right now!

364
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.898
Shame on you.

365
00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:51.831
Give that to me.

366
00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.636
What? Shame on me?

367
00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:57.938
Yeah. Tina said you were smart.

368
00:13:57.971 --> 00:14:00.073
that you were
a hard-working man.

369
00:14:00.107 --> 00:14:01.608
What the hell is wrong with you?

370
00:14:01.641 --> 00:14:02.809
You have two great kids!

371
00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.644
And you want to come into
your wife's place of employment

372
00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:06.113
with a gun

373
00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:08.148
and accuse her of doing
something inappropriate?

374
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.649
Are you stupid? Are you?

375
00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:10.884
No.

376
00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:11.885
Are you crazy?

377
00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:13.153
No! I just wasn't--

378
00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:14.021
...Thinking!
Yes. that's right.

379
00:14:14.054 --> 00:14:15.055
You weren't thinking.
but that's okay.

380
00:14:15.088 --> 00:14:16.089
'cause I'm gonna think
for the both of us. okay?

381
00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:20.327
Now. give me the gun
before you ruin your life.

382
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.062
Come on. I don't have
all day. all right?

383
00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:23.130
So give me the gun
before I call the cops

384
00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:25.032
and tell them that
Hector Mendoza's a psychopath

385
00:14:25.065 --> 00:14:26.666
-and he--
-I'm not a psychopath.

386
00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.201
Don't make me
count to three. okay?

387
00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:29.436
-[Hector sobbing]
-One...

388
00:14:29.469 --> 00:14:31.304
[Hector sobs]

389
00:14:31.338 --> 00:14:32.906
Two...

390
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.107
[Anna shrieks]

391
00:14:36.043 --> 00:14:38.111
Chill out! Chill out!

392
00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:41.148
Chill! You all right?

393
00:14:43.016 --> 00:14:45.285
[Letty] What the hell
were you thinking?

394
00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:45.953
It's not that big of a deal.

395
00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:48.055
What are you talking about?

396
00:14:48.088 --> 00:14:50.057
Calling the cops
is a huge deal!

397
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.924
Tina never
should have done that.

398
00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.026
She's fired.

399
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.928
Whoa! Can we just think
about this rationally?

400
00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:55.828
There were gunshots.

401
00:14:55.862 --> 00:14:57.164
What the hell
was she supposed to do?

402
00:14:57.197 --> 00:14:58.631
Not call the cops!

403
00:14:58.665 --> 00:14:59.766
Now we're on their radar.

404
00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:03.670
I got a whole department
wanting massages for 25% off.

405
00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:06.139
That's the last thing we need!

406
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.609
Why'd you even open the door
in the first place?

407
00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:12.212
I thought he was a customer
and we needed the money.

408
00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:14.047
We always need the money

409
00:15:14.081 --> 00:15:15.448
because you refuse to update

410
00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:16.984
and modernize
your business practices.

411
00:15:17.017 --> 00:15:19.019
Just because you read a book

412
00:15:19.052 --> 00:15:21.088
doesn't mean you know
how to run a business. Anna.

413
00:15:21.121 --> 00:15:22.222
It's common sense. Okay?

414
00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.457
If we charged a premium.

415
00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:26.326
we would have
higher-quality clients.

416
00:15:26.359 --> 00:15:27.460
the girls would work less.

417
00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:30.063
and we wouldn't have to hustle
for every single dime.

418
00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:31.031
I mean. Enema Man?

419
00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:33.266
One point Anna.

420
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.036
Look. I've run
the numbers. okay?

421
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:38.038
Work smarter not harder.

422
00:15:38.071 --> 00:15:39.739
We could do so much
for ourselves.

423
00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:43.110
for the girls.
for everyone.

424
00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:45.178
if we just make a few changes.

425
00:15:45.212 --> 00:15:45.745
I like this.
Two points Anna.

426
00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:48.181
Goodnight. Arthur.

427
00:15:48.215 --> 00:15:49.649
Yep. Goodnight.

428
00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:51.618
Good luck.

429
00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:59.126
So you think
you can do better?

430
00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:00.727
I think
the girls can do better.

431
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.496
And I think you can do better.

432
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.672
I like my place.

433
00:16:12.705 --> 00:16:14.741
[Anna sighs]

434
00:16:14.774 --> 00:16:16.776
I can afford my place.

435
00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:20.013
It's people like you

436
00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:22.549
who think too big
and aim too high

437
00:16:22.582 --> 00:16:23.750
that end up in prison.

438
00:16:23.783 --> 00:16:24.784
Don't fire Tina.

439
00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:26.286
It's already done.

440
00:16:26.319 --> 00:16:27.554
Well. then. if she goes.

441
00:16:27.587 --> 00:16:29.222
I go.

442
00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:34.461
Fine.

443
00:16:36.063 --> 00:16:38.665
Fine.

444
00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.671
[Anna] I was at rock bottom.

445
00:16:44.704 --> 00:16:46.539
No money. no job.

446
00:16:46.573 --> 00:16:48.141
and was about to be
thrown out on the street

447
00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:49.109
with my kids.

448
00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:50.743
So what do we do now?

449
00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:54.481
We could be secretaries.

450
00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.116
Yeah.

451
00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:58.251
I'd let you come stay with us.

452
00:16:58.285 --> 00:17:00.253
but me and the kids are back
living with my mother.

453
00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:03.723
Look.

454
00:17:03.756 --> 00:17:05.225
Letty won't tell you this.

455
00:17:05.258 --> 00:17:05.925
but in the six months
that you worked there.

456
00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.261
things have never run smoother--

457
00:17:08.295 --> 00:17:09.462
except that last part.

458
00:17:09.496 --> 00:17:11.431
-Really?
-Art said so every day.

459
00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.501
Milo! Celeste!

460
00:17:14.534 --> 00:17:16.169
Vamonos.

461
00:17:16.203 --> 00:17:18.705
Why don't you open
your own business?

462
00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:19.739
Seriously?

463
00:17:19.772 --> 00:17:21.674
Why not?

464
00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:22.109
I'd come work for you.

465
00:17:25.812 --> 00:17:27.380
Think about it.

466
00:17:29.849 --> 00:17:31.518
See you around.

467
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:32.585
Yeah.

468
00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:33.586
Ándale. mijitos.

469
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.255
Let's go.

470
00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:35.922
[Anna]
And that's when I decided

471
00:17:35.955 --> 00:17:37.790
I had to take a leap.

472
00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:38.691
I had nothing to lose.

473
00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:41.428
[dialing phone]

474
00:17:42.329 --> 00:17:43.863
[line ringing]

475
00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:47.234
Hey. Art? It's me.

476
00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:48.835
I have a crazy idea.

477
00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.871
Well. kids.

478
00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:54.607
What do you think?

479
00:17:54.641 --> 00:17:55.608
It's gross.

480
00:17:55.642 --> 00:17:56.709
Smells like poop.

481
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:59.212
No. John Christopher.
This smells like potential.

482
00:17:59.246 --> 00:18:01.481
I see it.

483
00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:03.450
Oh. by the way. you're it.

484
00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.220
[Anna] I started my business
with a $5.000 loan from Arthur

485
00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:08.755
and what I'd learned
from my cousin.

486
00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:09.756
but I wasn't
going to have my girls

487
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:11.758
service nobodies
for pennies a pop.

488
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:14.761
They were going to get paid
what they were worth.

489
00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:17.497
We were going to be the ones
in control.

490
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:18.865
We were going to be exclusive.

491
00:18:18.898 --> 00:18:22.235
[**]

492
00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:29.342
[**]

493
00:18:29.376 --> 00:18:30.677
[knocking]

494
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.679
Anna Christine.
ladies and gentlemen!

495
00:18:32.712 --> 00:18:33.913
[Anna]
If I was going to be the best.

496
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:35.282
I had to hire the best.

497
00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:36.683
Look at you!

498
00:18:36.716 --> 00:18:37.116
We're gonna do it.

499
00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:41.020
Do you have boyfriends?

500
00:18:41.053 --> 00:18:42.589
Tina told her friends.
who told their friends.

501
00:18:42.622 --> 00:18:43.956
and so on.

502
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.925
The girls knew me. liked me.
and wanted to work for me.

503
00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.894
I made it a point to interview
every last one of them.

504
00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:49.896
Do you do drugs?

505
00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:52.932
First rule. No drugs.

506
00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.234
But I was tough.

507
00:18:57.704 --> 00:19:00.640
[**]

508
00:19:02.542 --> 00:19:04.644
Do you drink? Smoke? Party?

509
00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:05.111
Never.

510
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:07.280
This is a temple.

511
00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:10.883
Husband?
Boyfriend? Lover?

512
00:19:10.917 --> 00:19:11.884
No man alive that lucky.

513
00:19:11.918 --> 00:19:12.619
[Anna] Second rule?
No boyfriends.

514
00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.788
-How tall are you?
-I'm 6'1".

515
00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:17.390
70% legs

516
00:19:17.424 --> 00:19:20.227
and the rest
is boobs and attitude.

517
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.160
She's great.

518
00:19:24.231 --> 00:19:26.499
Victoria?

519
00:19:26.533 --> 00:19:27.567
Oh...

520
00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:32.739
Vicky. A "Victoria"
would have nicer shoes.

521
00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:34.474
Thank you.

522
00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:35.141
[Anna] Vicky Grant.

523
00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.777
I liked her right away.

524
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.446
So tell me about you.

525
00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:41.814
What do I need to know?

526
00:19:41.848 --> 00:19:44.417
Well. I left home when I was 15
for reasons I won't get into.

527
00:19:44.451 --> 00:19:46.253
but you know who JR is?

528
00:19:46.286 --> 00:19:47.119
I'm gonna be like him.

529
00:19:47.153 --> 00:19:49.289
but. like.
the female version of him.

530
00:19:49.322 --> 00:19:50.857
I believe in playing for keeps

531
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.592
and the best revenge
is living well.

532
00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:54.427
But just because I'm a runaway
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

533
00:19:54.461 --> 00:19:55.962
I'm putting myself
through school.

534
00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:57.230
I'm a sophomore.

535
00:19:57.264 --> 00:19:58.531
English Lit
with a business minor.

536
00:19:58.565 --> 00:20:00.933
but that tuition is a beast.

537
00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:01.834
John Christopher.

538
00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:04.471
Hey. kiddos. I'm working.
I'm so sorry.

539
00:20:04.504 --> 00:20:06.406
-Does that mean I'm it?
-Mm-hmm.

540
00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:07.274
[Anna] After a week.

541
00:20:07.307 --> 00:20:09.342
I put together

542
00:20:09.376 --> 00:20:12.645
the hottest. sexiest
group of girls in New York.

543
00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:14.947
Once you get the girls.
you get the clients.

544
00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:16.048
The market comes

545
00:20:16.082 --> 00:20:18.418
through networking on the beat.
on your feet.

546
00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:19.419
but not on the streets.

547
00:20:19.452 --> 00:20:20.653
That was low-class.

548
00:20:20.687 --> 00:20:21.654
I wanted the high-rollers.

549
00:20:21.688 --> 00:20:24.824
Drivers were an easy way in.

550
00:20:24.857 --> 00:20:27.527
Their clients were always rich
and looking for a pretty girl.

All my girls got makeovers
from the top down.

554
00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:39.739
They had to be the best version
of themselves.

555
00:20:39.772 --> 00:20:40.907
And so did I.

Hot. hot. hot *

00:20:56.456 --> 00:20:58.925
Everyone wanted to know
who we were.

563
00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:01.828

in everyone.

564
00:21:01.861 --> 00:21:03.663
I wanted the best.

00:21:05.498 --> 00:21:07.767

in seven-figure guys.

569
00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:22.048
I wanted eight-
and nine-figure guys.

570
00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:23.783
Men with real money.

571
00:21:25.818 --> 00:21:27.587

I gave them a tease.

and no one had called.

584
00:22:06.025 --> 00:22:07.193

Of course. I remember you.

conjure up your dream girl.

and what would she do for you?

And I have
the perfect one for you.

00:22:28.415 --> 00:22:29.449
She's one of my A-List girls.

00:22:31.818 --> 00:22:33.686
Beautiful.

597
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.022
Let me just check
her availability.

598
00:22:37.657 --> 00:22:40.860
With my first client.
I played it like Studio 54.

You know how. like.
in the early days.

600
00:22:42.595 --> 00:22:43.596
there'd be a line outside.

601
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.164
but inside the club
would be empty?

602
00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.499
Well. that created demand.

603
00:22:46.533 --> 00:22:47.500
It made clients--

604
00:22:47.534 --> 00:22:48.501
especially
those hedge-fund guys

605
00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:50.870

what they wanted--

606
00:22:50.903 --> 00:22:52.739
want it more.

607
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.709
Well. unfortunately.
she makes her own schedule

608
00:22:56.743 --> 00:22:59.446
and she has exams coming up
so she's unavailable.

609
00:22:59.479 --> 00:23:00.713

00:23:00.747 --> 00:23:01.848
You're free to call back.

611
00:23:01.881 --> 00:23:03.883
In the next few days.
something might've opened up.

612
00:23:03.916 --> 00:23:06.619
but I honestly--
I can't guarantee anything.

613
00:23:06.653 --> 00:23:08.455
My girls don't work for me.
I work for them.

wife-beaters. or degenerates.

686

-Why?

723
00:27:18.771 --> 00:27:20.439
It wasn't because of
the Hector thing. was it?

724
00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:21.708

may have been onto me.

That's partly why
I couldn't branch out.

732
00:27:36.956 --> 00:27:39.025
Didn't know
if I was being watched.

733
00:27:39.058 --> 00:27:40.392
Well. why didn't you
say anything?

734
00:27:40.426 --> 00:27:44.096
Mm. My business. my problem.

735
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.298
[chuckles]

736
00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:50.937
Well. I mean.
if you need some extra cash.

737
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.471
you can. uh. you can always
come work for me.

738
00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.440
You can't afford me.

739
00:27:54.473 --> 00:27:55.474
[laughs]

740
00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:57.209
I'll think about it.

741
00:27:58.510 --> 00:27:59.746
[chuckling]

742
00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:03.215
[Anna] And just like that.
my team was complete.

743
00:28:10.957 --> 00:28:12.224
There you go. sweetheart.

744
00:28:12.258 --> 00:28:13.392
Hey. Mom.

745
00:28:13.425 --> 00:28:15.194
Hi. beautiful girl.

746
00:28:15.227 --> 00:28:16.829
[Anna]
Welcome to my double life.

747
00:28:16.863 --> 00:28:18.831
On the weekdays.

748
00:28:18.865 --> 00:28:20.099
my children
were off to school by 7:00.

749
00:28:20.132 --> 00:28:23.235
My daughter rode horses
and my son played soccer.

750
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:26.172
As for my business.
I ran it like a Fortune 500.

751
00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:28.274
I ran it
clean. honest. and fair.

752
00:28:28.307 --> 00:28:29.641
I shut my phone off
on Friday night

753
00:28:29.675 --> 00:28:32.444
and never worked a weekend
unless there was a problem.

754
00:28:32.478 --> 00:28:33.512
[Anna shrieks]

755
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:34.180
I even opened a nail salon
as a front

756
00:28:34.213 --> 00:28:35.514
to keep things legal--

757
00:28:35.547 --> 00:28:37.116
well. legal-ish.

758
00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:38.250
And to give my kids
something to say

759
00:28:38.284 --> 00:28:41.187
when people asked
what I did for a living.

760
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.790
Vicky and Tina were
my first paying customers.

761
00:28:43.823 --> 00:28:46.125
[laughing and shrieking]

762
00:28:49.128 --> 00:28:51.230
All right. so.
I'm gonna be at your game.

763
00:28:51.263 --> 00:28:54.100
but Ms. Robbie's gonna
give you a ride there. okay?

764
00:28:54.133 --> 00:28:55.034
Okay.

765
00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:57.870
I love you.
Hey! Learn something today.

766
00:28:59.338 --> 00:29:00.472
Bye. honey.

767
00:29:00.506 --> 00:29:02.975
I owe you so much.
Thank you.

768
00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:06.212
Oh. And here are some snacks
for half-time.

769
00:29:06.245 --> 00:29:07.346
Perfect.

770
00:29:07.379 --> 00:29:08.848
Oh. How many raffle tickets
did you want this year?

771
00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:11.383
Uh... a thousand.

772
00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:13.519
Anything for
the Eastside Eagles. right?

773
00:29:13.552 --> 00:29:14.553
Yeah.

774
00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.923
All right. thank you. honey.

775
00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:18.157
-I appreciate it.
-See ya.

776
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:19.826
Bye.

777
00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:20.526
[gasps as brakes screech]

778
00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.029
Oh! So sorry.

779
00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:26.398
[school bell rings]

780
00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:28.500
[Anna] Once or twice a month.

781
00:29:28.534 --> 00:29:30.469
I'd go into the city
to do business.

782
00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:31.503
I never knew what to expect.

783
00:29:31.537 --> 00:29:32.638
but. honestly.

784
00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:33.940
I stopped being surprised
a long time ago.

785
00:29:33.973 --> 00:29:35.908
That's him.

786
00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:40.779
Go get him. girls.

787
00:29:42.915 --> 00:29:46.185
Adam Saltzmeyer.
Age 41.

788
00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:47.820
Hedge fund manager
at Clark & Darrow.

789
00:29:47.854 --> 00:29:49.421
Net worth: half a billion.

790
00:29:49.455 --> 00:29:51.323
Alias: Amber Alert.

791
00:29:56.062 --> 00:29:56.795
-What are you doing?
-Shut up.

792
00:29:56.829 --> 00:29:58.564
What's going on?
Who are you guys?

793
00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:02.134
-Tell me you've been naughty!
-Let's go.

794
00:30:02.168 --> 00:30:03.936
[Adam groaning. muffled]

795
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:04.904
Someone's been naughty!

796
00:30:04.937 --> 00:30:07.139
And he has a bad peepee.

797
00:30:07.173 --> 00:30:07.806
[muffled]
I have a bad peepee.

798
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.608
[Anna] There was no sex.

799
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:11.410
Just the thrill
of getting abducted

800
00:30:11.443 --> 00:30:12.544
and slapped around

801
00:30:12.578 --> 00:30:14.180
by two of my "A"-list girls
for an hour.

802
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:17.316
Fee? $5.000. Cash.

803
00:30:17.349 --> 00:30:19.285
Tell me you've been naughty!
[groaning] Oh. ho. ho!

804
00:30:19.318 --> 00:30:20.319
How bad?

805
00:30:20.352 --> 00:30:21.053
Oh! Real bad!

806
00:30:21.087 --> 00:30:23.422
-Here it is!
-You've got this!

807
00:30:23.455 --> 00:30:24.223
Whoo!

808
00:30:24.256 --> 00:30:25.892
Let's support each other
out there!

809
00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:27.226
Mom! You're. like. so late.

810
00:30:27.259 --> 00:30:29.128
I know. I'm sorry.
What did I miss?

811
00:30:29.161 --> 00:30:30.496
Well. John Christopher scored.

812
00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:31.530
-Yes!
-Yeah.

813
00:30:31.563 --> 00:30:33.365
[Anna] Come on. honey!

814
00:30:34.967 --> 00:30:36.302
What are these?

815
00:30:36.335 --> 00:30:37.336
College. mom.

816
00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:39.906
Mr. Colson says we have
to start thinking early.

817
00:30:39.939 --> 00:30:40.606
[Ms. Robbie]
That reminds me.

818
00:30:40.639 --> 00:30:41.640
Yeah.

819
00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:42.942
Raffle tickets.

820
00:30:42.975 --> 00:30:44.443
-Oh. thank you.
-By the way...

821
00:30:44.476 --> 00:30:45.978
the other moms are convinced
you just buy them up yourself.

822
00:30:46.012 --> 00:30:48.881
Not true.
I never cheat!

823
00:30:48.915 --> 00:30:51.117
I do things
fair and square.

824
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.051
Oh. wait--
Oh. oh. oh. oh. oh!

825
00:30:52.084 --> 00:30:53.052
Oh. oh. oh. oh. oh--

826
00:30:53.085 --> 00:30:55.988
oh. oh. oh!
Go. go. go. go. go. go. go. go!

827
00:30:56.022 --> 00:30:57.489
[cheering]

828
00:30:57.523 --> 00:30:57.856
[all cheering]

829
00:31:03.295 --> 00:31:04.396
Thank you.

830
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:05.297
[Anna] I was always
looking for new girls.

831
00:31:05.331 --> 00:31:08.267
and had my pick
of the best.

832
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.535
But the best
wasn't good enough.

833
00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:11.270
They had to be unique.

834
00:31:11.303 --> 00:31:12.504
Fresh.

835
00:31:12.538 --> 00:31:14.273
Special.

836
00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:18.410
[**]

837
00:31:18.444 --> 00:31:20.412
Have her come see me
when she gets a chance.

838
00:31:21.013 --> 00:31:24.016
Thanks.

839
00:31:25.517 --> 00:31:27.419
[**]

840
00:31:32.691 --> 00:31:34.526
Even when
looking for new girls.

841
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.096
I made a point to take care
of my older ones.

842
00:31:37.129 --> 00:31:37.696
We were a family.
after all.

843
00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:40.432
Hey.

844
00:31:40.466 --> 00:31:41.500
Sit.

845
00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:44.670
Anna. what's all this?

846
00:31:44.703 --> 00:31:45.904
There's more.

847
00:31:48.607 --> 00:31:49.942
Ohh.

848
00:31:49.976 --> 00:31:51.143
[chuckles]

849
00:31:52.044 --> 00:31:53.980
Oh. my god. Anna.

850
00:31:54.013 --> 00:31:56.148
You shouldn't have.

851
00:31:56.182 --> 00:31:58.184
Here. Let me put it on.

852
00:31:59.518 --> 00:32:01.720
You started working for me
five years ago today.

853
00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.323
You were my first girl
to ever book a job

854
00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:07.593
and you are still
my number-one girl.

855
00:32:09.461 --> 00:32:11.430
To you.

856
00:32:11.463 --> 00:32:12.598
To us.

857
00:32:12.631 --> 00:32:13.199
[clink]

858
00:32:13.232 --> 00:32:15.001
[chuckles]

859
00:32:15.034 --> 00:32:17.103
Mm. This looks
good on me. right?

860
00:32:17.136 --> 00:32:18.704
Really good.

861
00:32:20.206 --> 00:32:23.375
[Anna] Hey. what do you think
about that waitress over there?

862
00:32:23.409 --> 00:32:25.711
[**]

863
00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:29.215
You can do better. Anna.

864
00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:30.983
Hmm.

865
00:32:31.017 --> 00:32:33.685
[**]

866
00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:35.687
You wanted to see me?

867
00:32:35.721 --> 00:32:37.223
Can I help you?

868
00:32:37.256 --> 00:32:39.525
We can help each other.

869
00:32:39.558 --> 00:32:40.426
Cassidy...

870
00:32:40.459 --> 00:32:42.461
sit.

871
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.331
I'm--

872
00:32:45.364 --> 00:32:46.432
I know.

873
00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:49.768
I know who you are
and I think I know what you do.

874
00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.703
You think?

875
00:32:51.737 --> 00:32:54.140
People whisper about it.

876
00:32:54.173 --> 00:32:55.241
I'm not judging.

877
00:32:55.274 --> 00:32:55.774
It just seems so...

878
00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.109
[sighs]

879
00:32:57.143 --> 00:33:00.712
Everyone that you talk to

880
00:33:00.746 --> 00:33:02.048
is so fancy.

881
00:33:02.081 --> 00:33:03.115
-Where're you from?
-Spokane.

882
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:05.317
You're a terrible waitress.

883
00:33:05.351 --> 00:33:06.118
[laughs]

884
00:33:06.152 --> 00:33:07.653
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

885
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.522
What do you want
in life. Spokane?

886
00:33:10.556 --> 00:33:12.324
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

887
00:33:12.358 --> 00:33:14.193
Well. you know what I do.

888
00:33:14.226 --> 00:33:15.461
so let me work for you.

889
00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:17.096
Me?

890
00:33:17.129 --> 00:33:18.597
[scoffs] Really?

891
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:19.798
I-- [laughs]

892
00:33:19.831 --> 00:33:21.533
No.

893
00:33:21.567 --> 00:33:23.069
I couldn't.

894
00:33:23.102 --> 00:33:24.136
Squeamish? Shy?

895
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.571
-No. No.
-Drugs?

896
00:33:25.604 --> 00:33:26.538
Boyfriend?

897
00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:28.174
No.

898
00:33:28.207 --> 00:33:29.175
You're perfect.

899
00:33:29.208 --> 00:33:31.377
There's a few things

900
00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.212
your mother probably
never told you. Spokane.

901
00:33:33.245 --> 00:33:36.748
Being young and beautiful
is a privilege.

902
00:33:36.782 --> 00:33:37.283
It doesn't last long.

903
00:33:37.316 --> 00:33:38.817
but if you're smart.

904
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.153
you can cash in
and make it work for you.

905
00:33:41.187 --> 00:33:42.521
Men make all the rules.

906
00:33:42.554 --> 00:33:45.324
They get what they want
when they want it.

907
00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:46.792
but there's always
one thing they want

908
00:33:46.825 --> 00:33:48.827
that we don't have to give them.

909
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.198
We can make them pay for it.

910
00:33:52.231 --> 00:33:54.366
Make the system work for us

911
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.303
and claim our little slice
of the American Dream.

912

mutually beneficial
to each other.

922

I'd make an exception.

put me in the hospital.

Anna. Hi.

1099

Hi.

1100
00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:46.712
Is that one yours?

1101
00:40:46.745 --> 00:40:48.714
-Yeah.
-She looks comfortable.

1102
00:40:48.747 --> 00:40:49.681
How long did that take?

1103
00:40:49.715 --> 00:40:52.518
Five years? Six. maybe.

1104
00:40:52.551 --> 00:40:54.720
My wife used to ride.

1105
00:40:54.753 --> 00:40:55.587
Before she passed.

1106
00:40:55.621 --> 00:40:58.490
I promised her
I'd get Emma into it.

1107
00:40:58.524 --> 00:41:01.527
My kid has no interest
in doing what Mom wanted.

1108
00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.529
She wants to play the violin.

1109
00:41:03.562 --> 00:41:05.964
What. she can't do both?

1110
00:41:05.997 --> 00:41:06.565
You ever heard an 8-year-old
play the violin?

If you have any questions.

1114
00:41:13.605 --> 00:41:15.974
Mia could always
give Emma some pointers.

1115
00:41:16.007 --> 00:41:18.744
By the way. this is not
me hitting on you.

Hey. you okay?

1128
00:41:47.606 --> 00:41:49.975
Is it your ankle?

1129
00:41:50.008 --> 00:41:51.276
Okay. here.
Let me help you up.

1130
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:52.644
Come on.

1131
00:41:52.678 --> 00:41:53.812
Grab onto me. baby.

1132
00:41:53.845 --> 00:41:54.813
[Mia] It really hurts.

1133
00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:56.848
[Anna] Okay. apply
more pressure on me. baby.

1134

Oh. well. now she hates horses.
Lovely.

1135
00:42:00.686 --> 00:42:03.254
It's a good thing
it's just a sprained ankle.

1136
00:42:03.288 --> 00:42:04.255
Mm.

of my party budget?

1140
00:42:09.027 --> 00:42:09.761
You need a DJ.

for you.

That's too bad.

1171
00:43:03.682 --> 00:43:05.050
You know. maybe I should

1172

just take a vacation
for a few days.

It's never a coincidence

1174
00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:10.889
when clients start canceling
one after the other--

1175
00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:12.858
especially when
they've booked the same girl

1176
00:43:12.891 --> 00:43:13.491
and don't reschedule.

1177
00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.727
I knew what was up.

1178
00:43:15.761 --> 00:43:17.796

Yeah. you know what?

00:43:29.808 --> 00:43:30.475
We were in this
from the beginning

1184

and this is what she does to me?

1185
00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:35.647
Well. she's not as young
as she used to be.

1186
00:43:35.681 --> 00:43:37.749
I'm sure she has her reasons.

1187
00:43:37.783 --> 00:43:39.951
I put her through college.

1188
00:43:39.985 --> 00:43:40.819
Okay.

does she think she is?

[Anna] I was the co-signer
on Vicky's first condo

1193
00:43:57.803 --> 00:43:59.437
and had a set of back-up keys.

1194
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.140
When I knew she'd be out.

1195
00:44:02.173 --> 00:44:03.641
I let myself in.

Just what I thought.

1197
00:44:10.515 --> 00:44:12.250
She was getting clients
to cancel with me.

seeing them anyway.

1199
00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:14.786

for herself--

1200
00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:15.453

00:44:26.364 --> 00:44:27.799
She also owed me 16 grand.

00:47:25.476 --> 00:47:28.379
[**]

1274
00:47:36.154 --> 00:47:36.955
That looked dramatic.

1275
00:47:36.988 --> 00:47:38.856
[forced chuckle]

1276
00:47:41.492 --> 00:47:42.627
Do tell.

1277
00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:57.675
No...

1278
00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:58.676
-Come on.

1279
00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.979
Let's go.

1280
00:48:01.012 --> 00:48:02.413
Come on!

1281
00:48:04.682 --> 00:48:05.083
Take the money.

1282
00:48:05.116 --> 00:48:05.616
Don't kill me.

1283
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:06.684
Shut up and listen.

1284
00:48:06.717 --> 00:48:09.187
Take the money.

1285
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.922
The airport's a mile that way.

1286
00:48:10.956 --> 00:48:13.158
Get on a plane
and don't come back.

1287
00:48:13.191 --> 00:48:15.560
'cause. if you do.

1288
00:48:15.593 --> 00:48:15.893
there's gonna be a problem.

1289
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.035
[door rumbles and thuds]

1290
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:26.437
[**]

1291
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.076
I think you made your point.

1292
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:33.644
Oh. I did.

1293
00:48:33.678 --> 00:48:34.712
[both laughing]

1294
00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:36.681
[Anna] Being a madam
is a lonely life.

1295
00:48:36.714 --> 00:48:38.149
everyone's your enemy.

1296
00:48:38.183 --> 00:48:40.085
but we were equals.

1297
00:48:40.118 --> 00:48:42.053
That night.
Simone and I became friends.

1298
00:48:42.087 --> 00:48:44.189
By closing time. we agreed

1299
00:48:44.222 --> 00:48:46.491
that if one of my regulars
was traveling to Europe.

1300
00:48:46.524 --> 00:48:49.127
Simone would handle it
and vice versa.

1301
00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.095
With Simone backing me up.

1302
00:48:50.128 --> 00:48:52.530
I was Don Corleone.

1303
00:48:53.464 --> 00:48:55.500
[Owen]
So. what do you do for fun?

1304
00:48:55.533 --> 00:48:57.135
I took the kids to Orlando
last summer.

1305
00:48:57.168 --> 00:48:58.003
We did all the parks.

1306
00:48:58.036 --> 00:48:59.437
And then last year.
we went skiing.

1307
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:02.173
Now I'm a working mom
and that feels right.

1308
00:49:02.207 --> 00:49:03.975
I like being valuable to people.

1309
00:49:04.009 --> 00:49:05.076
And I have
a pretty good group of girls.

1310
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.078
for the most part.

1311
00:49:07.112 --> 00:49:08.713
-At the salon?
-Right.

1312
00:49:08.746 --> 00:49:10.615
At the salon. yes.

1313
00:49:11.616 --> 00:49:13.384
Well...

1314
00:49:13.418 --> 00:49:14.752
here we are.

1315
00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:15.987
What do you think?

1316
00:49:16.021 --> 00:49:17.488
I like it.

1317
00:49:17.522 --> 00:49:18.756
I couldn't tell you why.
but I-- I do.

1318
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:21.059
Thanks.

1319
00:49:21.092 --> 00:49:24.629
So you did this.
from top to bottom?

1320
00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:25.763
And everything in between.

1321
00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:27.732
Did I impress you?

1322
00:49:27.765 --> 00:49:29.500
Maybe.

1323
00:49:29.534 --> 00:49:30.968
[chuckles]

1324
00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:34.305
This one is Emma's favorite.

1325
00:49:34.339 --> 00:49:36.207
Every time we drive past.
she points at it.

1326
00:49:36.241 --> 00:49:38.009
she says.
"That's Daddy's building."

1327
00:49:38.043 --> 00:49:40.078
That's pretty cool. you know?

1328
00:49:40.111 --> 00:49:42.780
When your kid's proud of you.

1329
00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:46.617
And hopefully. one day.
the grandkids'll know about it.

1330
00:49:46.651 --> 00:49:48.619
That's legacy.

1331
00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.790
Wow.

1332
00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:55.126
I really did impress you.

1333
00:49:56.127 --> 00:49:57.728
Want to take a closer look?

1334
00:49:57.762 --> 00:49:58.663
Yeah.

1335
00:50:02.067 --> 00:50:04.302
This is me.

1336
00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:07.805
We. uh.
we should do this again.

1337
00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:09.240
I'd invite you over.

1338
00:50:09.274 --> 00:50:11.342
but my son has just discovered
whoopee cushions

1339
00:50:11.376 --> 00:50:13.111
and you'd be a perfect target.

1340
00:50:13.144 --> 00:50:14.479
Well. next time.

1341
00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:15.546
Yeah.

1342
00:50:18.716 --> 00:50:19.750
Sorry.

1343
00:50:19.784 --> 00:50:21.052
It's. uh...

1344
00:50:21.086 --> 00:50:22.087
it's been a while.

1345
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.290
I'm willing to give it a shot.

1346
00:50:26.191 --> 00:50:29.026
[**]

1347
00:50:40.671 --> 00:50:41.572
Goodnight.

1348
00:50:42.807 --> 00:50:44.675
Goodnight.

1349
00:50:50.148 --> 00:50:51.048
[phone rings]

1350
00:50:54.252 --> 00:50:55.653
This is Anna.

1351
00:50:55.686 --> 00:50:57.088
[line hangs up]

1352
00:50:57.122 --> 00:50:59.757
[dial tone buzzing]

1353
00:50:59.790 --> 00:51:01.659
[Anna] Dropped calls
mean one of two things--

1354
00:51:01.692 --> 00:51:03.361
one. bad service.

1355
00:51:03.394 --> 00:51:05.596
Two. the Feds were onto me.

1356
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.732
Now. I'd been careful.
but in the back of my mind.

1357
00:51:07.765 --> 00:51:09.534
I worried if
someone might be listening.

1358
00:51:09.567 --> 00:51:10.368
Mom?

1359
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:13.204
Is everything okay?

1360
00:51:13.238 --> 00:51:15.173
Everything's fine.

1361
00:51:15.206 --> 00:51:16.774
Would you tell me
if it wasn't?

1362
00:51:16.807 --> 00:51:18.476
[**]

1363
00:51:23.548 --> 00:51:25.183

1365
00:51:29.154 --> 00:51:33.558
* It's all play
or not at all *

1366
00:51:33.591 --> 00:51:35.293
* If you wanna
dance. dance. dance... *

1367
00:51:35.326 --> 00:51:36.127
Hello. girls!

1368
00:51:36.161 --> 00:51:38.463
How are you?

1369
00:51:38.496 --> 00:51:40.465
Cake and presents
in five minutes.

1370
00:51:41.432 --> 00:51:42.767
What's with the attitude?

1371
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.669
What's with your attitude?

1372
00:51:44.702 --> 00:51:47.705
You're the one
always sneaking around.

1373
00:51:47.738 --> 00:51:49.707
I'm gonna ignore that.

1374
00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.242
Presents. Go.

1375
00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:55.246
Hey. wow. This party--

1376
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.514
how much is this
setting us back?

1377
00:51:56.547 --> 00:51:58.883
Why do you care?
We're doing better than ever.

1378
00:51:58.916 --> 00:51:59.750
Yeah. about that.

1379
00:51:59.784 --> 00:52:01.919
Jasmine's still
not returning calls.

1380
00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:03.188
Neither is Trish or Lucy.

1381
00:52:03.221 --> 00:52:04.355
Okay. I'll look into it.

1382
00:52:04.389 --> 00:52:05.890
Oh. and you still have to buy
raffle tickets from me.

1383
00:52:05.923 --> 00:52:06.491
-Don't forget.
-Right.

1384
00:52:06.524 --> 00:52:08.459
Yeah. I have the money.

1385
00:52:08.493 --> 00:52:10.428
Hey. Uncle Art. look at Wilbur.

1386
00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:12.163
Wow. Is that a tutu?

1387
00:52:12.197 --> 00:52:14.465
[laughing]

1388
00:52:14.499 --> 00:52:16.301
Okay. come here.
Let me see this.

1389
00:52:16.334 --> 00:52:17.935
You're crazy!

1390
00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:20.238
* You look fabulous!

1391
00:52:20.271 --> 00:52:20.938
Thanks. mami.

1392
00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:22.173
So do you.

1393
00:52:22.207 --> 00:52:24.542
Thank you.

1394
00:52:24.575 --> 00:52:25.710
Okay. I gotta talk to you.

1395
00:52:25.743 --> 00:52:26.244
Why can't we all just
have a good time?

1396
00:52:26.277 --> 00:52:28.479
Come on.

1397
00:52:28.513 --> 00:52:29.013
Look. If it's about Simone.
I don't want to hear it. Okay?

1398
00:52:29.046 --> 00:52:30.948
What's done is done.

1399
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.650
It's about Mia.

1400
00:52:32.683 --> 00:52:33.518
What about her?

1401
00:52:33.551 --> 00:52:34.919
You're gonna
have to tell her. Anna.

1402
00:52:34.952 --> 00:52:36.921
Tell her what?

1403
00:52:36.954 --> 00:52:38.956
-About what you do.
-Why would I do that?

1404
00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:41.359
[Letty] Because
she's been asking questions

1405
00:52:41.392 --> 00:52:42.627
and I can't keep lying for you.

1406
00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.263
Look. She's 16.
She's not stupid.

1407
00:52:45.296 --> 00:52:46.597
It's better
if it comes from you.

1408
00:52:46.631 --> 00:52:47.832
because if she figures
it out on her--

1409
00:52:47.865 --> 00:52:48.499
I'll think about it. okay?

1410
00:52:48.533 --> 00:52:50.868
Do more than think about it.

1411
00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:52.737
You tell her. or I will.

1412
00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:53.904
Jesus. Letty. Cake!

1413
00:52:53.938 --> 00:52:54.939

[Art] DJ. music again!

[Anna]
Robert Sanford. age 55.

1431
00:53:35.913 --> 00:53:39.484
Ran an international
online gambling casino.

1432
00:53:39.517 --> 00:53:42.353
Net worth: 5.6 billion.

1433
00:53:42.387 --> 00:53:44.622
Alias: Mr. Cellophane.

1434
00:53:44.655 --> 00:53:46.324
Tell Anna what you told me.

1435
00:53:46.357 --> 00:53:47.792
She left me tied to the chair

1436
00:53:47.825 --> 00:53:49.694
for two hours
while she went shopping

1437
00:53:49.727 --> 00:53:50.761
with my card.

1438
00:53:50.795 --> 00:53:51.962
So?

1439
00:53:51.996 --> 00:53:52.497
I got a bracelet for Mia

1440
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:54.465
and a purse for you.

1441
00:53:54.499 --> 00:53:56.634
And I bought the Shakespeare
collection for myself.

1442
00:53:56.667 --> 00:53:58.903
King Lear's
always been my favorite.

1443
00:53:58.936 --> 00:54:00.338
And I got room service.

1444
00:54:00.371 --> 00:54:02.006
All the room service.

1445
00:54:02.039 --> 00:54:03.341

1446
00:54:03.374 --> 00:54:05.009
I want my money back.

1447
00:54:05.042 --> 00:54:07.645
Were you bad. Bob?
Did you disobey Mistress?

1448
00:54:07.678 --> 00:54:09.013
He was nine minutes late.

1449
00:54:09.046 --> 00:54:12.583
Mistress was displeased.

1450
00:54:12.617 --> 00:54:13.150
He had to be punished.

1451
00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:14.885
I'm not paying for this!

1452
00:54:14.919 --> 00:54:16.387
You're absolutely right.

1453
00:54:19.357 --> 00:54:20.558
You're paying double.

1454
00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:21.392
You broke the rules.

1455
00:54:21.426 --> 00:54:23.528
you were disrespectful
to Mistress.

1456
00:54:23.561 --> 00:54:25.330
and you got me out of
my kid's Sweet 16 party.

1457
00:54:25.363 --> 00:54:30.034
You know how often a Sweet 16
happens in a kid's life. Bob?

1458
00:54:30.067 --> 00:54:31.436
Once.

1459
00:54:31.469 --> 00:54:34.305
Exactly. So double. plus tip.

1460
00:54:34.339 --> 00:54:35.506
And I don't care
if she leaves you

1461
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:36.807
tied up like this
till morning.

1462
00:54:40.545 --> 00:54:41.912
Do we understand each other?

1463
00:54:41.946 --> 00:54:43.481
Mm-hmm.

1464
00:54:43.514 --> 00:54:44.214
Apologize to your mistress.

1465
00:54:44.248 --> 00:54:46.584
[muffled]
I'm sorry. Mistress.

1466
00:54:46.617 --> 00:54:47.318
And you're also buying
100 raffle tickets

1467
00:54:47.352 --> 00:54:49.053
to support the Eastside Eagles.

1468
00:54:49.086 --> 00:54:50.087
Are we clear?

1469
00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.889
Mm-hmm.

1470
00:54:51.922 --> 00:54:54.559
He's all yours. Lola.

1471
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:06.571
[tires screeching]

1472
00:55:08.005 --> 00:55:08.973
Mom?

1473
00:55:10.408 --> 00:55:11.376
Why aren't you in bed?

1474
00:55:11.409 --> 00:55:12.443
Why are you sneaking around?

1475
00:55:12.477 --> 00:55:14.379
What's up with you lately?

1476
00:55:14.412 --> 00:55:16.113
You just had an amazing
Sweet 16 party.

1477
00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:18.449
You missed
the last half of it.

1478
00:55:18.483 --> 00:55:20.117
I had an emergency at work.

1479
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.487
-With "head-hunting"?
-Yes.

1480
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:23.954
What was it?

1481
00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:27.392
A client wasn't happy
and didn't want to pay.

1482
00:55:27.425 --> 00:55:29.126
That couldn't wait
until Monday?

1483
00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:30.628
That's the business.

1484
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:31.629
What do you want me to do?

1485
00:55:31.662 --> 00:55:33.764
It just paid for your party
now. didn't it?

1486
00:55:33.798 --> 00:55:34.264
You wouldn't lie to me.
would you. Mom?

1487
00:55:34.298 --> 00:55:37.435
Mia. what is this?

1488
00:55:37.468 --> 00:55:39.003
Why can't you just say no?

1489
00:55:39.036 --> 00:55:41.906
No. I wouldn't lie to you.

1490
00:55:41.939 --> 00:55:43.474
Go to bed.

1491
00:55:47.478 --> 00:55:49.480
[sighing]

1492
00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:53.718
-Here you go.
-Hey.

1493
00:55:55.553 --> 00:55:58.155
[bill counter clacking]

1494
00:55:58.188 --> 00:56:01.058
Have you gotten
any dropped calls recently?

1495
00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:01.959
-A few. Why?

1496
00:56:01.992 --> 00:56:03.728
-So have I.
-Me too.

1497
00:56:04.562 --> 00:56:05.663
It's not good. Anna.

1498
00:56:05.696 --> 00:56:06.664
[Art] And it's not just that.

1499
00:56:06.697 --> 00:56:08.499
It's the girls. too--
Jasmine. Trish. Lucy.

1500
00:56:08.533 --> 00:56:10.435
Word on the street

1501
00:56:10.468 --> 00:56:11.902
is they're getting poached.

1502
00:56:11.936 --> 00:56:12.870
By who?

1503
00:56:12.903 --> 00:56:14.171
Don't know.
Someone who's new to the game.

1504
00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:15.806
And they're not only
taking the girls.

1505
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:16.641
they're taking the clients.

1506
00:56:16.674 --> 00:56:18.876
and they're marking
their territory.

1507
00:56:18.909 --> 00:56:19.877
I think it's--

1508
00:56:20.478 --> 00:56:22.747
What?

1509
00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:23.781
Time.

1510
00:56:23.814 --> 00:56:25.416
Might be time to get out. Anna.

1511
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:26.551
No!

1512
00:56:26.584 --> 00:56:28.553
No! Why are you even
talking like that?

1513
00:56:28.586 --> 00:56:29.987
How many times
do I have to say it?

1514
00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.189
No amount of money
is worth your freedom.

1515
00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:33.424
and listen to your gut.

1516
00:56:33.458 --> 00:56:34.358
When things get weird.

1517
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:36.494
it's the universe telling you
it's time.

1518
00:56:40.064 --> 00:56:40.865
No.

1519
00:56:40.898 --> 00:56:43.200
No. I'm not
gonna be intimidated.

1520
00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:44.569
What kind of message
does that send?

1521
00:56:44.602 --> 00:56:45.603
That you're smart.

1522
00:56:45.636 --> 00:56:46.771
That I'm scared!

1523
00:56:46.804 --> 00:56:48.205
If I have to dangle someone else
out the window. I will.

1524
00:56:48.238 --> 00:56:50.975
-Anna.
-We are business as usual.

1525
00:56:51.008 --> 00:56:53.478
Letty. go into the city
and start asking around.

1526
00:56:53.511 --> 00:56:54.211
See what you can find out
about whoever's messing

1527
00:56:54.244 --> 00:56:56.747
with my bottom line.

1528
00:56:56.781 --> 00:56:58.583
Arthur. if you're spooked.
we can reroute websites.

1529
00:56:58.616 --> 00:57:00.184
start another LLC.
and pause deposits.

1530
00:57:00.217 --> 00:57:02.820
Happy?

1531
00:57:04.054 --> 00:57:05.055
Okay.

1532
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:15.566
[Anna] I was losing her.

1533
00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:16.901
I could feel it.

1534
00:57:16.934 --> 00:57:18.603
Kids know
when you're lying to them.

1535
00:57:18.636 --> 00:57:21.972
and if they can't trust you.
they resent you.

1536
00:57:23.073 --> 00:57:24.575
Put that away.

1537
00:57:24.609 --> 00:57:27.011
I want to talk to you
about something.

1538
00:57:27.044 --> 00:57:28.913
You know that.
ever since Dad died.

1539
00:57:28.946 --> 00:57:30.615
I work very hard

1540
00:57:30.648 --> 00:57:32.449
to provide for you
and your brother. right?

1541
00:57:32.683 --> 00:57:35.085
And I love you both
so much.

1542
00:57:35.119 --> 00:57:39.123
How would you feel
if I told you that I...

1543
00:57:40.525 --> 00:57:43.528
That you...?

1544
00:57:43.561 --> 00:57:47.164
[sighs]

1545
00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:48.866
...Have a boyfriend.

1546
00:57:48.899 --> 00:57:50.000
That's it?

1547
00:57:51.168 --> 00:57:52.637
That's it.

1548
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:54.539
Are you sure
there's nothing else?

1549
00:57:54.572 --> 00:57:56.741
That's it. kiddo.

1550
00:57:56.774 --> 00:57:59.143
I'd be happy for you. Mom.

1551
00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:04.248
[**]

1552
00:58:05.182 --> 00:58:07.251
[phone rings]

1553
00:58:07.284 --> 00:58:09.620
This is Anna.

1554
00:58:09.654 --> 00:58:11.622
[line hangs up]

1555
00:58:11.656 --> 00:58:13.758
[dial tone buzzing]

1556
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:18.228
[Anna sighs]

1557
00:58:18.262 --> 00:58:20.765
[phone rings]

1558
00:58:20.798 --> 00:58:21.498
[snaps] Who is this?

1559
00:58:21.532 --> 00:58:23.534
Anna. It's me.
Are you okay?

1560
00:58:23.568 --> 00:58:25.936
Yeah. Yeah.
I just got a little spooked.

1561
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:28.205
I have good news and bad news.

1562
00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:31.208
The good news is. I found out
who's poaching your girls.

1563
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:31.742
Who is it?

1564
00:58:31.776 --> 00:58:34.244
That's the bad news.

1565
00:58:34.278 --> 00:58:35.780
It's Vicky.

1566
00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:40.585
[Anna] That's when
I realized Letty was right.

1567
00:58:40.618 --> 00:58:42.653
I'd made a mistake.

1568
00:58:42.687 --> 00:58:43.688
Gone too far.

1569
00:58:43.721 --> 00:58:46.056
I had to be smarter.

1570
00:58:49.026 --> 00:58:49.994
Anna?

1571
00:58:50.027 --> 00:58:52.229
You did good.

1572
00:58:52.262 --> 00:58:53.263
I'll take care of it.

1573
00:58:53.297 --> 00:58:54.098
I don't want

1574
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:55.933
any part
of your "taking care" of it.

1575
00:58:55.966 --> 00:58:59.236
Anna. now might be
a really good time

1576
00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:00.237
to consider getting--

1577
00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:01.606
We'll talk tomorrow.

1578
00:59:01.639 --> 00:59:04.208
[car tires screeching]

1579
00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:09.213
[engine rumbles]

1580
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:14.318
Who are you?

1581
00:59:14.351 --> 00:59:16.220
Who sent you?

1582
00:59:16.253 --> 00:59:17.955
You think you can scare me?

1583
00:59:17.988 --> 00:59:18.723
You think you can
show up at my house?

1584
00:59:18.756 --> 00:59:20.324
Mom?

1585
00:59:20.357 --> 00:59:22.259
What the hell?

1586
00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:24.094
[groans and sighs]

1587
00:59:25.195 --> 00:59:26.897
Are you drunk?

1588
00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:27.998
No.

1589
00:59:29.199 --> 00:59:31.568
Get outta here before I call
the cops. you little creep.

1590
00:59:33.638 --> 00:59:36.240
Inside. Now.

1591
00:59:39.209 --> 00:59:41.311
Since when do you drink?

1592
00:59:41.345 --> 00:59:43.080
I had a wine cooler.

1593
00:59:43.113 --> 00:59:43.648
Big deal.

1594
00:59:43.681 --> 00:59:45.650
And who was that guy?

1595
00:59:45.683 --> 00:59:47.384
A boy who's my friend.

1596
00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:48.919
So now you have
a secret boyfriend?

1597
00:59:48.953 --> 00:59:50.621
It's better than
a secret life.

1598
00:59:50.655 --> 00:59:51.789
What's that supposed to mean?

1599
00:59:51.822 --> 00:59:53.724
You think I'm stupid?

1600
00:59:53.758 --> 00:59:56.927
You don't just run a salon.

1601
00:59:56.961 --> 00:59:58.395
Marty's dad's a head-hunter.

1602
00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.797
and he has an office

1603
00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:02.032
and normal business hours

1604
01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:04.869
and doesn't always
pay for things in hundreds.

1605
01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:08.272
I know
what you do for a living.

1606
01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:12.009
What is it
that you think I do?

1607
01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:12.743
Ask away.

1608
01:00:12.777 --> 01:00:15.045
20 questions. Go.

1609
01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:16.681
-Are you a millionaire?
-Yes.

1610
01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:18.082
Are you paid in cash?

1611
01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:18.649
Yes.

1612
01:00:18.683 --> 01:00:20.751
Is what you do legal?

1613
01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:23.120
No.

1614
01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:25.189
If someone found out.
could you go to jail?

1615
01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:27.157
Don't lie.

1616
01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:31.028
Yes.

1617
01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:32.629
Are you a drug dealer?

1618
01:00:32.663 --> 01:00:34.398
What?

1619
01:00:34.431 --> 01:00:37.101
Listen to me. Mia.
I am not a drug dealer.

1620
01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.336
Okay?
I would never do that.

1621
01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.270
Then what?

1622
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:47.778
I'm a madam.

1623
01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:51.181
[**]

1624
01:00:51.816 --> 01:00:54.151
[sobs]

1625
01:00:56.787 --> 01:00:58.288
[sighs heavily]

1626
01:01:03.227 --> 01:01:04.461
Okay. so...

1627
01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.796
[Anna]
After she'd calmed down.

1628
01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:08.132
I started at the beginning
and told her everything--

1629
01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:08.799
from "Enema Man"

1630
01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:10.935
to "Russian James Bond".

She deserved the truth.

Coming clean to her

1634
01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:19.777
was the second biggest gamble
of my life.

1636
01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:22.947

But if it's illegal
and you get caught.

1642
01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.498
what happens to us?

1643
01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:43.433
I won't get caught.

1644
01:01:43.467 --> 01:01:45.202
No one ever thinks
they're gonna get caught

1645
01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:45.903
and then they do.

1646
01:01:45.936 --> 01:01:48.005
What would we do without you?

1647
01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.273
It's not gonna happen.

[Anna] But first.

1657
01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.195
I had to take care of a problem
I'd created

1658
01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:12.997

[door buzzer ringing]

1660
01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:20.470
I found out
where Vicky was living

1661
01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:21.839
and placed an ad
with her address

1662
01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:23.808

and go underground.

1670
01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:43.828
My poached girls came back
and I was back on track.

1671

But my promise to Mia
wasn't going as well.

As far as transitions go.

where to start.

I had no ideas.

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:57.174
And then I just got lucky.

and his building and legacy.

I wanted to create
something I could leave behind.

I broke my promise.

1988
01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:17.046
I called Arthur

1989
01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.782
and he arranged for us to meet
with a pair of investors.

1990
01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:20.917
My business has always been

1991
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:22.652
about catering
to the most exclusive clients.

1992
01:15:22.686 --> 01:15:24.788
As Arthur can tell you.

1993
01:15:24.821 --> 01:15:26.956
I turned a profit
with my first business

1994
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:28.091
within the first two months.

1995
01:15:28.124 --> 01:15:30.326
and I expect
I can do even better here.

1996
01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:32.295
We like it.

1997
01:15:32.328 --> 01:15:34.931
A lot.

1998
01:15:39.703 --> 01:15:42.005
They better be legit. Arthur.

1999
01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:43.339
-They are.
-Well. you need to be sure

2000
01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:44.574
because I don't
want to be knee-deep

2001
01:15:44.608 --> 01:15:45.909
in Russian hooker drug money.

2002
01:15:45.942 --> 01:15:48.244
My kids are counting on me
not to keep messing up.

2003
01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:49.613
I know that.
You don't think I know that?

2004
01:15:49.646 --> 01:15:52.081
Your kids
are like my kids. Anna.

2005
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:54.884
Look. Look.

2006
01:15:54.918 --> 01:15:55.451
We got a 10:00 a.m.
at the bank tomorrow

2007
01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:57.721
to transfer the funds.

2008
01:15:57.754 --> 01:15:59.255
These guys are the real deal.

2009
01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.224
I promise.

2010
01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:01.524
I--

2011
01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:02.726
What?

2012
01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:04.360
What is up with you lately. Art?

2013
01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.129
Nothing. No.

2014
01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:08.297
It's just everything.
It's a lot.

2015
01:16:08.331 --> 01:16:09.733
Yeah. Uh...

2016
01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:11.034
This is gonna work.

2017
01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:11.701
It's legit.
We're gonna be fine.

2018
01:16:11.735 --> 01:16:13.703
We better be

2019
01:16:13.737 --> 01:16:14.671
or it's your ass.

2020
01:16:14.704 --> 01:16:15.705
I know.

2021
01:16:16.706 --> 01:16:18.107
See you tomorrow.

2022
01:16:23.713 --> 01:16:25.314
[Anna]
When I woke up that morning.

2023
01:16:25.348 --> 01:16:26.616
I knew something was wrong.

2024
01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:31.087
but I couldn't quite
put my finger on what it was.

2025
01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.221
[sighs heavily]

2026
01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:33.289
You look nice.

2027
01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:34.323
Thank you.

2028
01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:35.324
And you'll be back in time
for the meet. right?

2029
01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:38.194
Absolutely. Should be back
before noon. okay?

2030
01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:38.728
I love you.

2031
01:16:38.762 --> 01:16:41.197
And I love you. too.

2032
01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:43.232
Ooh! Learn something
today. okay?

2033
01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:44.267
Okay.

2034
01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.401
[Anna chuckles]

2035
01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:46.602
-Bye.
-Bye.

2036
01:16:55.779 --> 01:16:58.147
[Anna]
No one showed at the bank.

2037
01:16:58.181 --> 01:16:59.749
not even Arthur.

2038
01:16:59.783 --> 01:17:01.117
who wasn't answering my calls.

2039
01:17:03.753 --> 01:17:07.757
[**]

2040
01:17:18.001 --> 01:17:21.104
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

2041
01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.205
Help!

2042
01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:24.173
Somebody help!
I'm being kidnapped!

2043
01:17:27.043 --> 01:17:28.411
Somebody!

2044
01:17:33.717 --> 01:17:34.884
[Anna] I thought this was it--

2045
01:17:34.918 --> 01:17:36.019
my last day on Earth.

2046
01:17:36.052 --> 01:17:38.722
I prayed my kids
would be okay without me.

2047
01:17:38.755 --> 01:17:41.290
But I wasn't going
without a fight.

2048
01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.930
I didn't know where I was.

2049
01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:48.431
where they'd taken me.

2050
01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:49.866
Was this it?

2051
01:17:49.899 --> 01:17:51.367
A bullet
to the back of the head

2052
01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:51.667
and then nothing?

2053
01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:56.205
Sit down! Sit down.

2054
01:18:04.047 --> 01:18:05.815
Well. you're a giant pain
in my ass.

2055
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.785
[**]

2056
01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:14.690
[sighs]

2057
01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:18.261
Like I said
a thousand times already.

2058
01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:19.495
I don't know
what you're talking about.

2059
01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:20.496
I want to speak to my lawyer

2060
01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:23.800
and then I want
to get the hell out of here.

2061
01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:24.734
My kid has a meet at 5:00.

2062
01:18:24.768 --> 01:18:26.502
About your lawyer.

2063
01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.104
What about him?

2064
01:18:28.137 --> 01:18:29.806
We've already spoken to him.

2065
01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:32.375
We've... been speaking to him.

2066
01:18:32.408 --> 01:18:33.176
For months now.

2067
01:18:33.209 --> 01:18:34.811
And a woman named Melody.
Get it?

2068
01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:40.416
Art?

2069
01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:41.851
Yes.

2070
01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:45.354
[Anna] I'd gotten sloppy.

2071
01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:47.523
right when
I had almost gone straight.

2072
01:18:47.556 --> 01:18:48.691
He was family--

2073
01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:51.394
the first person
who had ever believed in me.

2074
01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:52.829
I think he'd been trying
to tell me in his own way.

2075
01:18:52.862 --> 01:18:55.865
but I didn't listen.

2076
01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:57.700
[sniffles]

2077
01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:00.303
I want my phone call.

2078
01:19:00.336 --> 01:19:01.504
Now.

2079
01:19:01.537 --> 01:19:03.239
Anna...

2080
01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:04.841
help us help you.

2081
01:19:04.874 --> 01:19:06.309
You don't have counsel.

2082
01:19:06.342 --> 01:19:08.812
which means its gonna take us
at least 24 hours

2083
01:19:08.845 --> 01:19:11.080
to assign you
a public defender.

2084
01:19:11.114 --> 01:19:14.918
That means you're gonna be
in Rikers for an entire night.

2085
01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:16.085
Is that what you want?

2086
01:19:16.119 --> 01:19:17.286
I want my phone call.

2087
01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:19.288
We're not unreasonable.

2088
01:19:19.322 --> 01:19:21.925
We just have a few questions
about some of your clients.

2089
01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:23.827
At the salon?

2090
01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.028
Why do you want
to know about people

2091
01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:26.796
who get their toenails done
and their upper lips waxed?

2092
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:29.032
You give us answers

2093
01:19:29.065 --> 01:19:31.200
and maybe we can get you
to your meet on time.

2094
01:19:31.234 --> 01:19:33.937
You abducted me off the streets
in broad daylight.

2095
01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:35.872
You didn't read me my rights.

2096
01:19:35.905 --> 01:19:38.007
Why should I believe
anything that you say?

2097
01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.843
What do you know
about these people?

2098
01:19:39.876 --> 01:19:42.211
Take your time.

2099
01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:44.013
[Anna]
They were all there--

2100
01:19:44.047 --> 01:19:46.415
all my clients
over the last five years--

2101
01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:48.317
Amber Alert. Big Pharma.
Russian James Bond.

2102
01:19:49.953 --> 01:19:52.922
I knew I was about
to get effin' hammered.

2103
01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.028
I don't know
any of these people.

2104
01:19:59.062 --> 01:20:00.930
-Sorry.
-Rikers. then?

2105
01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:13.176
[crowd applauds]

2106
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:23.819

2107
01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:34.463
[**]

2108
01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:36.132
Letty. it's me.

2109
01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:38.334
The eagle has landed.

2110
01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:42.238
[voice breaks]
Take care of the kids. okay?

2111
01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:46.842
[prisoners hooting and jeering]

2112
01:20:49.278 --> 01:20:52.581
Hey. Martha Stewart.
What'd you do? Rob a Saks?

2113
01:20:52.615 --> 01:20:54.517
[woman cackling]

2114
01:20:58.021 --> 01:21:01.257

[**]

2118
01:21:58.581 --> 01:21:59.949
Hey.

2119
01:21:59.983 --> 01:22:02.551
We're gonna be okay. okay?

2120
01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:06.689
Where's Mia?

2121
01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:14.697
No one?

2122
01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:15.231
[Letty] No one.

2123
01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.300
[Anna] That hurt.

2124
01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:19.635
No one had returned
Letty's calls for my bail.

2125
01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:21.670
Not Simone.
Not Owen. Not Cassidy.

2126
01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:22.972
None of my clients.

2127
01:22:23.006 --> 01:22:25.141
Well. there's plenty of money.

2128
01:22:25.174 --> 01:22:26.742
They took it

2129
01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.377
in the raid. Anna.

2130
01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:28.944
All of it.

2131
01:22:28.978 --> 01:22:31.347
There's nothing left.

2132
01:22:33.582 --> 01:22:35.751
[**]

2133
01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.420
[Anna] I was so screwed.

2134
01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:38.988
I was pretty sure
I was going away for life.

2135
01:22:39.022 --> 01:22:42.158
unless I cooperated.

2136
01:22:43.159 --> 01:22:45.128
But there's
a thing called honor.

2137
01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:47.663
I wasn't going to ruin
anyone else's life.

2138
01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:51.000
Five months--
that's how long they held me.

2139
01:22:51.034 --> 01:22:53.736
As it turns out.
I really wasn't the target.

2140
01:22:53.769 --> 01:22:54.737
My clients were.

2141
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.772
Finally.
I was offered a plea deal.

2142
01:22:56.805 --> 01:22:58.574
[**]

2143
01:22:58.607 --> 01:23:00.676
[shutters snapping]

2144
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:03.179
[**]

2145
01:23:03.212 --> 01:23:05.148
I was sentenced to time served
and released.

2146
01:23:05.181 --> 01:23:09.018
I may have looked free.
but I wasn't.

2147
01:23:09.052 --> 01:23:10.319
The money was gone.

2148
01:23:10.353 --> 01:23:12.121
I was all over the local news.

2149
01:23:12.155 --> 01:23:13.489
and the moment
I stepped outside.

2150
01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:14.990
there were a dozen reporters
trying to get my picture.

2151
01:23:17.226 --> 01:23:19.395
So I couldn't leave the house.

2152
01:23:19.428 --> 01:23:21.464
Letty came
to get John Christopher.

2153
01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:24.767
and. finally.
it was just Mia and me.

2154
01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:28.171
Where are you going?

2155
01:23:28.204 --> 01:23:29.805
I'm going to stay with Letty.

2156
01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:31.207
What do you care?

2157
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.109
I care
because I'm your mother.

2158
01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:35.678
I don't have a mother.

2159
01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:37.246
How could you say that?

2160
01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:38.614
You said you were out.

2161
01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:40.549
I was! I-I tried.

2162
01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:41.250
You lied.

2163
01:23:41.284 --> 01:23:43.052
Maybe you shouldn't have been

2164
01:23:43.086 --> 01:23:45.088
a frigging madam
in the first place.

2165
01:23:45.121 --> 01:23:48.023
What's wrong with you?

2166
01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:51.427
I did my best. Mia.

2167
01:23:53.796 --> 01:23:55.298
It wasn't good enough.

2168
01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:57.433
You ruined everything--

2169
01:23:57.466 --> 01:23:59.102
this house. riding lessons.

2170
01:23:59.135 --> 01:24:02.771
My Sweet 16!

2171
01:24:02.805 --> 01:24:04.140
But who cares?

2172
01:24:04.173 --> 01:24:06.142
None of that matters.

2173
01:24:06.175 --> 01:24:09.145
We could've been living
in a box somewhere

2174
01:24:09.178 --> 01:24:12.081
and that would've been
better than all this.

2175
01:24:12.115 --> 01:24:14.583
At least we would have
all been together.

2176
01:24:18.421 --> 01:24:20.089
Now everything's gone.

2177
01:24:20.123 --> 01:24:21.624
Mia. I did my best.

2178
01:24:21.657 --> 01:24:23.526
And it's your fault!

2179
01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:27.763
And I'm never
speaking to you again.

2180
01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:29.732
Mia?

2181
01:24:29.765 --> 01:24:31.567
[Mia sobs]

2182
01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:43.078
[sobbing]

2183
01:24:48.884 --> 01:24:50.686
[Anna] This is what
a breakdown looks like.

2184
01:24:50.719 --> 01:24:52.521
I didn't know
where I was going.

2185
01:24:52.555 --> 01:24:54.857
I just knew
I had to go somewhere.

2186
01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:56.692
to start over.

2187
01:24:56.725 --> 01:24:57.092
[sniffling]

2188
01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.767
I drove all night.

2189
01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.870
and then. there it was.
a pig rescue farm.

2190
01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:14.410
I spent 14 months
at a rescue pig farm

2191
01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:16.145
as a live-in volunteer.
off the grid in Pennsylvania.

2192
01:25:16.179 --> 01:25:19.682
Who would have even thought
to look for me there?

2193
01:25:19.715 --> 01:25:22.385
That's where
I got my sanity back.

2194
01:25:25.254 --> 01:25:27.656
And every day.
I called my daughter.

2195
01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:28.857
Mia?

2196
01:25:28.891 --> 01:25:30.393
Mia. are you there?

2197
01:25:30.426 --> 01:25:31.394
She never answered

2198
01:25:31.427 --> 01:25:33.696
until that one day
when she did.

2199
01:25:33.729 --> 01:25:34.697
[Anna] That's okay.

2200
01:25:34.730 --> 01:25:38.301
you don't have to talk.
but if you'll. uh...

2201
01:25:38.334 --> 01:25:39.468
you'll just listen.

2202
01:25:39.502 --> 01:25:42.871
Look. I know "sorry"
isn't a big enough word.

2203
01:25:42.905 --> 01:25:45.241
I won't even bother saying it.

2204
01:25:47.343 --> 01:25:47.943
I just-- I want you to know

2205
01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:51.180
I love you so much

2206
01:25:51.214 --> 01:25:52.481
and I am--

2207
01:25:52.515 --> 01:25:54.650
I am so proud of you.

2208
01:25:55.818 --> 01:25:57.386
So...

2209
01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:58.954
my phone will always be on.

2210
01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.957
If you call. day or night.

2211
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:04.693
I swear I will pick it up.

2212
01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:11.166
Maybe one day
you can forgive me.

2213
01:26:13.736 --> 01:26:15.838
I miss you. kiddo.

2214
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:23.812
[sobbing]

2215
01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:28.584
[**]

2216
01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:43.832
[**]

2217
01:26:58.781 --> 01:27:02.885
[**]
