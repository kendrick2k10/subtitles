00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:42.212
What'’s the capital

175
00:13:42.256 --> 00:13:46.086
It'’s pronounced

Could I have my pills. please?

176
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:48.175
[all laughing]

177
00:13:48.218 --> 00:13:50.830
Shit. man.
Forgot my count. man.

178
00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:52.440
You made that up.

179
00:13:54.746 --> 00:13:56.444

Homeboy knows everything.
He a freak.

182
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:05.192
How do you know so much?

183
00:14:05.235 --> 00:14:08.586
Honestly. I wish I knew.
Makes me nuts.

184
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.632
Could I have my pills. please.

185
00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:18.422
Dang. girl.

188
00:14:26.953 --> 00:14:30.086
Okay.Damn. Impressive. man.

189
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:32.480
[laughs]

190
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:35.657
I said eyes on me.

191
00:14:36.049 --> 00:14:37.659
Come on. Ronny.

192
00:14:37.702 --> 00:14:40.357
There you go. man.

00:14:41.097 --> 00:14:42.359
That'’s only 55.

194
00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:44.448
For real?

195
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.624
Close enough.

196
00:14:46.668 --> 00:14:49.149
The hell it is.
I live on those.

197
00:14:50.237 --> 00:14:51.934
Sixty. Hey.

198
00:14:51.978 --> 00:14:53.240
[grunts]Hey.

199
00:14:53.283 --> 00:14:55.895
You want the real thing.

00:14:55.938 --> 00:14:58.941
That'’s folded over 70 times.
Carbon-treated steel.

201
00:14:58.985 --> 00:15:00.769
Take your damn hands off me.

202
00:15:00.812 --> 00:15:03.467
[cocks gun]You better tell your boy
to learn how to count.

203
00:15:03.511 --> 00:15:05.121
The deal is for 60 bags.

204
00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:08.342
Yeah?
Well. that'’s all we got.

205
00:15:08.385 --> 00:15:11.823
You don'’t like it.

206
00:15:13.216 --> 00:15:15.001
Get the gat on homeboy.

207
00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.395
[cocks gun]I wanna test this shit out.

208
00:15:22.356 --> 00:15:25.620
Yo. what'’s gunpowder
made of?

209
00:15:25.663 --> 00:15:26.926
[Ronny] Hold out your arm.

210
00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:28.492
Showtime.

211
00:15:30.886 --> 00:15:32.583
Hold out your arm.

212
00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.153
Get up.

213
00:15:37.197 --> 00:15:40.678
Put your arm there. huh?
It'’s the neck or arm. baby.

214
00:15:40.722 --> 00:15:42.811
You choose.

215
00:15:43.768 --> 00:15:45.292
Hey. Ronny.
That'’s not a toy. bro.

216
00:15:45.335 --> 00:15:46.728
Mind your business. Evan.

217
00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:48.730
Come on. Ronny.
This ain'’t funny.

218
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.262
[grunts] Oh. God!
My fingers!

219
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.656
[Shawna whimpers][groans]

220
00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:03.005
I think it works.
huh. Ronny?

221
00:16:03.049 --> 00:16:05.094
Cut my goddamn fingers off. man!

222
00:16:05.138 --> 00:16:08.924
You'’ll be all right.
Hey. sweetheart.
why don'’t you head on home now.

223
00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:10.708
[Ronny]
You'’re trippin'. bro.

224
00:16:10.752 --> 00:16:13.102
You are done. homey.
You'’re a dead fool.

225
00:16:13.146 --> 00:16:15.583
I don'’t know. Ronny.
You'’re talking to a guy

226
00:16:15.626 --> 00:16:17.802
who buys antipsychotic
medication from you.

227
00:16:17.846 --> 00:16:20.849
I'’m feeling
a little unbalanced
right now.

228
00:16:20.892 --> 00:16:24.200
Maybe the best way
to get the voices in my head
to stop talking

229
00:16:24.244 --> 00:16:25.680
is to cut yours off.

230
00:16:25.723 --> 00:16:27.551
Do you think it would help?

231
00:16:28.552 --> 00:16:31.599
No. Don'’t fight.
Don'’t shoot.
It'’s cool.

232
00:16:31.642 --> 00:16:33.470
We'’re cool. man.
We'’re cool. All right?

233
00:16:33.514 --> 00:16:37.126
Hey. dickhead.
Grab my pills. Now.

234
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.562
There you go.

235
00:16:38.606 --> 00:16:40.521
[Ronny] You'’re crazy. man.

236
00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:43.785
If I was crazy.
I'’d have chopped you up in
little pieces a long time ago.

237
00:16:43.828 --> 00:16:45.091
Give me my pills.

238
00:16:46.048 --> 00:16:48.877
Now. you listen to me. Ronny.
I'’m not crazy. okay?

239
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.011
Mm-hmm.I'’m just misunderstood.
All right?

240
00:16:57.451 --> 00:16:58.800
[gunshot]

241
00:17:10.072 --> 00:17:13.467

[sirens wailing]

247
00:18:21.839 --> 00:18:26.540
NYPD picked up
an Evan McCauley.
Drug deal gone south.

248
00:18:27.454 --> 00:18:29.760
Cops found a sword on him.

249
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.546
Blade was made with a process

250
00:18:32.589 --> 00:18:35.984
hasn'’t been used
since. uh. Edo Japan.

251
00:18:36.027 --> 00:18:38.160
[woman] So?

252
00:18:38.204 --> 00:18:40.684
He claims he forged it himself.

253
00:18:40.728 --> 00:18:43.165
Another broker-turned-hipster
blacksmith.

254
00:18:43.209 --> 00:18:46.386
Oh. ye of little faith.
Are you seeing this. Nora?

255
00:18:47.213 --> 00:18:50.346
Treadway?Precisely.

256
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.871
If we know. Bathurst knows.

257
00:18:53.915 --> 00:18:55.960
Be careful.

258
00:18:56.004 --> 00:18:57.658
Thanks. Mom.

259
00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:08.103
[door opens]

260
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.508
Tell us
when you'’re done. sir.

261
00:19:21.551 --> 00:19:23.597
[Evan]
Can I get my phone call?

262
00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:27.166
Supposed to get
a phone call.

263
00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:33.172
[chuckles]

264
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:43.965
You'’re dressed way too nice
to be an NYPD detective. so...

265
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:46.707
must be a doctor.

266
00:19:48.665 --> 00:19:50.145
Not a thing?

267
00:19:51.277 --> 00:19:53.627
No recognition at all?

268
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.588
I think
I should feel hurt.
[chuckles]

269
00:20:00.721 --> 00:20:04.594
Do you remember... Syracuse?

270
00:20:04.638 --> 00:20:06.422
Syracuse.

271
00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:07.815
The siege.

272
00:20:08.816 --> 00:20:10.818
Second Punic War.

273
00:20:12.298 --> 00:20:13.777
Where we first met.

274
00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:16.954
Well. not quite the thrill ride
of the First Punic War.

275
00:20:16.998 --> 00:20:19.218
but. hey.
sequels are tough. huh?

276
00:20:20.088 --> 00:20:21.307
You disappoint me.

277
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.439
Well. join the club.

278
00:20:23.483 --> 00:20:25.136
I notice...

279
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.139
you didn'’t sign it.

280
00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:33.188
[laughs] Then again...

281
00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:37.061
craftsmanship like this...

282
00:20:38.367 --> 00:20:41.370
you didn'’t need to. did you?

283
00:20:41.414 --> 00:20:44.243
I made a sword.
Is that a crime?

284
00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:48.116
[sword hits table]Evan McCauley.

285
00:20:48.856 --> 00:20:52.207
Diagnosed with schizophrenia
at 14...

286
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.037
after carving the words
"Look inside"

287
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.258
into your chest
with a box cutter.

288
00:20:59.997 --> 00:21:03.479
Electroshock proved unhelpful.

289
00:21:03.523 --> 00:21:05.220
But these...

290
00:21:06.352 --> 00:21:08.049
are not bad. eh?

291
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.535
Doctor. can I--Please. Go ahead.

292
00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:22.629
At 16. attempted suicide
via car crash.

293

necessitating the steel plate
in your skull.

294
00:21:26.067 --> 00:21:28.939
Spent the rest
of your early life

295
00:21:28.983 --> 00:21:33.204
bouncing around
between psych hospitals
and foster homes.

296
00:21:33.248 --> 00:21:35.337
Well. I only cut
a couple of his fingers off.

297
00:21:35.381 --> 00:21:38.645
I don'’t think I'm gonna need
to plead insanity on this one.
am I. Doctor?

298
00:21:38.688 --> 00:21:39.994
I'’m curious.

299
00:21:41.256 --> 00:21:42.779
"Look inside."

300
00:21:44.564 --> 00:21:46.870
Why those words?Why not?

301
00:22:12.418 --> 00:22:16.335
Which one of these...
is yours?

302
00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:20.382
You can skip the--
whatever the hell this is

303
00:22:20.426 --> 00:22:23.254
because none of that
is mine.

304
00:22:26.301 --> 00:22:28.782
You'’re not supposed
to have that in here.

305
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.357
What'’s going on here?

306
00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.359
Hey. Officer.

307
00:22:58.159 --> 00:23:01.641
Hey. what the hell
is going on here?

308
00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:08.822
Pick it up.

309
00:23:09.475 --> 00:23:10.693
What?

310
00:23:11.738 --> 00:23:13.087
Pick it up.

for a last meal.

Was it yours?

what you were talking about.
but I don'’t know what to tell--

"I don'’t know."

gets pulled.

00:23:52.822 --> 00:23:54.650
Is it yours?I don'’t know--

322
00:23:54.694 --> 00:23:56.522
Are you out of your mind?

when I put 250 grams of lead
through the back of your skull.

who was at the wrong place
at the wrong time. That'’s all.

00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:04.013
Inside![shouting]

350
00:27:04.057 --> 00:27:06.581
Hold tight.Oh. sh...

351
00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:12.065
[grunts]

352
00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:18.506
[officer]
Cover!

353
00:27:20.203 --> 00:27:22.379
What are you waiting for?
Come on. let'’s go!

354
00:27:22.423 --> 00:27:24.294
Go the other way!Take the wheel.

355
00:27:24.338 --> 00:27:26.166
What?[policeman] Get out of the car!

356
00:27:26.209 --> 00:27:29.386
Yeah. sure.
Retractable steering wheel.
No problem. That'’s normal.

357
00:27:32.302 --> 00:27:35.044
Reverse.Shoot that son of a bitch.

358
00:27:39.832 --> 00:27:42.878
[clamoring]Move! Clear the street!

359
00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:44.924
Shoot the driver!

360
00:27:49.624 --> 00:27:51.104
Jesus Christ!

361
00:27:54.977 --> 00:27:56.936
[policeman] Who are they?

362
00:28:01.288 --> 00:28:02.506
Relax. it'’s bulletproof.

363
00:28:06.075 --> 00:28:07.642
180 now!

364
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:25.965
Don'’t stop.

365
00:28:33.146 --> 00:28:34.713
[man yelling]

366
00:28:35.757 --> 00:28:37.716
[men screaming]

367
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.472
[policemen yelling]

368
00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:02.001
[grunts]

369
00:29:10.618 --> 00:29:12.272
Can I ask you a question?Yeah. sure.

370
00:29:12.315 --> 00:29:13.708
Who the hell are you?

371
00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:15.188
I'’m Nora Brightman.

372
00:29:15.231 --> 00:29:17.668
Okay. But who was
that dude back there?

373
00:29:17.712 --> 00:29:20.062
Bathurst.
You didn'’t recognize him?

374
00:29:20.106 --> 00:29:22.282
No. I didn'’t.
But clearly you did.

375
00:29:22.325 --> 00:29:24.240
Well. you'’ve known him
a long time.

376
00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:27.330
I'’ve never seen that man
before in my life.
Him. I think I'’d remember.

377
00:29:27.374 --> 00:29:29.419
Well. not in this life.
maybe.

378
00:29:29.463 --> 00:29:31.639
Oh. no. Maybe I bumped into him
during the Second Punic War?

379
00:29:31.682 --> 00:29:33.989
Or maybe it was
the French Revolution.
I'’m bad with dates.

380
00:29:34.033 --> 00:29:37.253
You remember that?No. I don'’t remember
the French Revolution.

381
00:29:37.297 --> 00:29:39.908
I figured it out.
I see now. I get it.

382
00:29:39.952 --> 00:29:42.215
You do?None of this is real.

383
00:29:42.258 --> 00:29:44.086
It'’s a psychotic break.

384
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.654
I'’m gonna wake up
in a hospital somewhere.
drooling all over myself.

385
00:29:46.697 --> 00:29:48.787
strung out on lithium.Is that easier to believe

386
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.963
than the idea that maybe
destiny has something
more in store for you?

387
00:29:51.006 --> 00:29:54.488
Destiny? Where I come from.
we got bills to pay.
rent to make.

388
00:29:54.531 --> 00:29:57.447
Nobody'’s got time for destiny.That'’s a shame.

389
00:30:12.898 --> 00:30:15.465
I know you'’ve been
looking for answers.
Evan.

390
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:17.816
But you'’re not crazy.
You never have been.

391
00:30:17.859 --> 00:30:20.775
No. I'’m not crazy.
I'’m just delusional.

392
00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:23.256
Do you ever find yourself
drawn to places
you'’ve never been?

393
00:30:23.299 --> 00:30:26.302
Do you ever see
a picture of a place
and just know you'’ve been there?

394
00:30:26.346 --> 00:30:27.608
Do you know things
you shouldn'’t?

395
00:30:27.651 --> 00:30:29.740
Do you pick up things fast.
almost as if

396
00:30:29.784 --> 00:30:32.526
you'’re remembering skills.
not learning them?

397
00:30:32.569 --> 00:30:34.571
I'’ve told
a dozen therapists this.

398
00:30:34.615 --> 00:30:37.096
I'’ve been analyzed
every way possible.
a hundred times over.

399
00:30:37.139 --> 00:30:38.532
It doesn'’t mean anything.

400
00:30:38.575 --> 00:30:40.882
Do you dream
in other languages?

401
00:30:40.926 --> 00:30:44.146
[speaks Russian.
Japanese]

402
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.410
That'’s what schizophrenia is.
Different people. same head.

403
00:30:47.454 --> 00:30:50.936
What if it were
the same person.
different lives?

404
00:30:50.979 --> 00:30:53.895
You'’re talking
about reincarnation.Yeah.

405
00:30:53.939 --> 00:30:56.593
You can forge a sword
because you were
a blacksmith.

406
00:30:56.637 --> 00:30:59.596
You speak Russian
because you were Russian.

407
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.337
Look. I hate to break it to you.

408
00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:04.427
It'’s a comforting idea.
souls moving from one body
to the next.

409
00:31:04.471 --> 00:31:08.344
But it'’s basically just
a spiritual equivalent of
"better luck next time." Okay?

410
00:31:08.388 --> 00:31:10.085
Nothing more and nothing less.

411
00:31:10.129 --> 00:31:13.088
Feel safe warm and inside
all that cynicism?I do. actually.

412
00:31:13.132 --> 00:31:15.525
And how'’s that
working out for you?In the grand scheme of things?

413
00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:17.440
Like big-picture shit?
Not so great.

414
00:31:17.484 --> 00:31:19.573
But I'’m good. I'm surviving.

415
00:31:20.922 --> 00:31:25.187
The visions you'’ve had
your entire life. Evan.
aren'’t hallucinations.

416
00:31:25.231 --> 00:31:26.667
They'’re memories.

417
00:31:27.668 --> 00:31:30.323
So. you'’re saying
that a hundred doctors
were wrong?

418
00:31:30.366 --> 00:31:35.284
Fifty medications didn'’t work
because I'’m really a
reincarnated Russian blacksmith?

419
00:31:35.806 --> 00:31:37.156
This is real.

420
00:31:37.983 --> 00:31:39.941
I'’m real.

421
00:31:39.985 --> 00:31:43.466
Oh. yeah? This is
no version of reincarnation
I'’ve ever heard of.

422
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.903
Buddhist. Hindu. Sikh.

423
00:31:44.946 --> 00:31:47.688
They believe each life begins
with a clean slate.

424
00:31:47.731 --> 00:31:50.734
The answers you'’ve been
looking for all your life...

425
00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:54.825
all you gotta do
is get on that plane.

426
00:31:57.437 --> 00:32:00.309
You know what I'’m really
asking myself right now is?

427
00:32:00.353 --> 00:32:03.791
What if the craziest thing
I'’ve ever heard--
and this is some crazy shit--

428
00:32:03.834 --> 00:32:06.576
is actually
the first thing that'’s
ever made any goddamn sense?

429
00:32:09.188 --> 00:32:13.496
I don'’t gotta go feed the cat.
so... let'’s go.

430
00:32:33.212 --> 00:32:36.911
[speaking Italian]

431
00:32:40.741 --> 00:32:41.960
Go on.

432
00:32:43.744 --> 00:32:48.575
[speaking.
gurgling. choking]

433
00:32:51.665 --> 00:32:54.407
[speaking. gurgling.
choking continue]

434
00:33:00.065 --> 00:33:03.459
[gasping]

435
00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:05.984
[woman] They left
from a private airport.

436
00:33:06.027 --> 00:33:07.898
It was an unlisted flight.

437
00:33:09.596 --> 00:33:10.945
She was there fast.

438
00:33:12.425 --> 00:33:14.340
Too fast.

439
00:33:14.383 --> 00:33:18.083
The sword hadn'’t been
in the system
for more than a few hours.

440
00:33:18.126 --> 00:33:20.781
Then they have a base
here in New York.I want it found.

441
00:33:20.824 --> 00:33:24.263
It will lead us
to Evan McCauley.

442
00:33:24.306 --> 00:33:26.265
He will lead us
to the Egg.

443
00:33:26.308 --> 00:33:27.962
Again.

444
00:33:29.094 --> 00:33:31.574
[speaking Latin]

445
00:33:32.706 --> 00:33:36.971
[continues speaking
in Latin]

446
00:33:40.627 --> 00:33:42.629
[shouting. choking]

447
00:33:48.374 --> 00:33:50.593
[Nora] We call ourselves
the Infinite.

448
00:33:50.637 --> 00:33:53.161
Less than 500 souls
from across the globe.

449
00:33:53.205 --> 00:33:57.470
all born with the ability
to remember all our past lives

450
00:33:57.513 --> 00:34:00.342
and the skills we'’ve learned
in each of them.

451
00:34:00.386 --> 00:34:02.127
There are two groups
within the Infinites:

452
00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:07.088
Bathurst and the Nihilists.
who just want the world to end.

453
00:34:07.132 --> 00:34:09.612
and us... the Believers.

454
00:34:10.222 --> 00:34:11.962
And what is it
that we believe?

455
00:34:12.006 --> 00:34:15.662
We believe that our gift
is a responsibility.

456
00:34:15.705 --> 00:34:18.447
That it'’s up to us
to leave humanity

457
00:34:18.491 --> 00:34:21.320
better off than we found it.Yeah.

458
00:34:22.451 --> 00:34:24.540
I think
I'’m gonna need these.

459
00:34:57.312 --> 00:34:59.793
Hey.Hey.

460
00:34:59.836 --> 00:35:00.924
Thanks.

461
00:35:02.883 --> 00:35:05.190
Wow. It'’s a long way
from Arthur Avenue.

462
00:35:05.233 --> 00:35:06.495
[chuckles]

463
00:35:07.279 --> 00:35:08.802
It always blows
my mind.

464
00:35:09.716 --> 00:35:11.935
We call it the Hub.

465
00:35:16.592 --> 00:35:19.726
This is the place
where you'’re gonna get
your memories back. Evan.

466
00:35:22.207 --> 00:35:23.686
We'’ll be landing soon.

467
00:35:39.006 --> 00:35:43.141
Recognize anything?I'’m pretty sure
I'’d remember this.

468
00:35:43.184 --> 00:35:45.752
It used to be dedicated
to scientific research.

469
00:35:45.795 --> 00:35:48.058
Anthropology and linguistics.

470
00:35:48.102 --> 00:35:50.235
All of us using
what we'’ve learned.

471
00:35:50.278 --> 00:35:53.629
Life after life
for the advancement
of mankind.

472
00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:55.109
And what is it now?

473
00:35:56.066 --> 00:35:59.113
Headquarters
for the losing side
in the war.

474
00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:03.552
[shouting. grunting]

475
00:36:03.596 --> 00:36:06.033
Bathurst is the master
of combat.

476
00:36:06.076 --> 00:36:07.556
Hundreds of lifetimes.

477
00:36:15.956 --> 00:36:18.132
You must be prepared
for everything.

478
00:36:26.532 --> 00:36:28.577
He'’s the apex predator
in our world.

479
00:36:31.493 --> 00:36:32.973
Again.

480
00:36:38.587 --> 00:36:40.763
[speaking Japanese]

481
00:36:41.677 --> 00:36:43.201
Why are they bowing?

482
00:36:43.244 --> 00:36:45.768
They'’re hoping
you'’re Heinrich Treadway.

483
00:36:45.812 --> 00:36:47.944
[instructor] Again!Reincarnated.

484
00:36:47.988 --> 00:36:49.729
"Heinrich"?

485
00:36:49.772 --> 00:36:52.079
It was a popular name
in the '’50s.

486
00:36:52.122 --> 00:36:53.602
In the '’50s.

487
00:36:53.646 --> 00:36:57.040
Great for rock '’n' roll.
but lousy for names.
I guess.

488
00:36:57.084 --> 00:36:59.260
The 1750s.

489
00:36:59.304 --> 00:37:00.827
[instructor grunts]

490
00:37:02.176 --> 00:37:04.831
What do I know
that you need so bad?

491
00:37:04.874 --> 00:37:07.834
That'’s why you're here--
to find out.

492
00:37:08.704 --> 00:37:12.534
[grunting continues]

493
00:37:30.987 --> 00:37:34.991
This is Treadway'’s room.Are you asking me
or telling me?

494
00:37:35.035 --> 00:37:38.343
I must'’ve really screwed up
on my last incarnation.

495
00:37:38.386 --> 00:37:39.909
Why would you say that?

496
00:37:40.693 --> 00:37:42.999
Have you seen where I live
in this life?

497
00:37:48.962 --> 00:37:51.921
That'’s Treadway's
Himalaya diary.

498
00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:57.579
That was me.

499
00:37:58.406 --> 00:38:00.147
When I was Leona Warrick.

500
00:38:01.453 --> 00:38:03.977
And that was Treadway.

501
00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:06.806
[Leona screams]

502
00:38:06.849 --> 00:38:08.895
[gasping][grunts]

503
00:38:08.938 --> 00:38:10.288
[gasps]

504
00:38:11.593 --> 00:38:13.639
Two days after that picture
was taken.

505
00:38:13.682 --> 00:38:15.554
Treadway saved my life.

506
00:38:16.685 --> 00:38:19.601
There'’s a reason
you picked that book.

507
00:38:20.385 --> 00:38:22.909
All this tells me
is what he did.

508
00:38:22.952 --> 00:38:24.954
None of it tells me
who he was.

509
00:38:24.998 --> 00:38:27.914
Here we can study
anything and everything.

510
00:38:27.957 --> 00:38:31.396
Space. time. scale.
It'’s all relevant.

511
00:38:32.135 --> 00:38:34.224
That doesn'’t seem
like much.

512
00:38:34.268 --> 00:38:36.531
[woman]
Welcome to my virtual sandbox.

513
00:38:36.575 --> 00:38:38.403
Name'’s Garrick.Hi.

514
00:38:38.446 --> 00:38:40.883
Garrick is our head
of technology and research.

515
00:38:40.927 --> 00:38:42.972
He doesn'’t
look like much.

516
00:38:43.756 --> 00:38:45.845
Goddamn. it'’s good
to see you again.

517
00:38:45.888 --> 00:38:48.369
It'’s nice to meet you too.

518
00:38:48.413 --> 00:38:52.155
Don'’t worry.
All this shit.
it just gets weirder.

519
00:38:52.199 --> 00:38:53.505
Okay.

520
00:38:53.548 --> 00:38:54.984
Now let'’s get started.

521
00:38:55.028 --> 00:38:56.072
Follow me.

522
00:38:59.511 --> 00:39:01.295
Stand there for me.
please.

523
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:03.036
Okay.

524
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.219
[hologram powers up]

525
00:39:19.835 --> 00:39:22.011
That'’s the guy
from the police station.

526
00:39:22.055 --> 00:39:25.275
[Garrick] Bathurst.
He and Treadway
were once friends.

527
00:39:25.928 --> 00:39:27.713
A dozen lifetimes.
Wars. peace.

528
00:39:27.756 --> 00:39:31.369
They stood together at
some of the greatest moments
in human history.

529
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.067
Then Bathurst lost faith.

530
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:38.114
For the last 300 years.
he'’s been looking
for a way out.

531
00:39:38.158 --> 00:39:40.900
He needed a way
to stop reincarnating.

532
00:39:40.943 --> 00:39:42.771
He wants it all to end.

533
00:39:42.815 --> 00:39:45.252
[Garrick]
That'’s why he made this.

534
00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:19.982
[Garrick] The Egg.
designed to kill every
living thing on earth.

535
00:40:20.679 --> 00:40:23.159
[Evan]
That seems a little drastic.

536
00:40:23.203 --> 00:40:25.248
[Nora]
If there'’s nothing left alive.

537
00:40:25.292 --> 00:40:28.251
there'’s nothing left
to reincarnate into.

538
00:40:30.471 --> 00:40:34.823
[Garrick]
It attacks life
at the source-- DNA--

539
00:40:34.867 --> 00:40:37.478
unwinding the very fabric
of existence.

540
00:40:37.522 --> 00:40:41.569
Every plant. every animal
every person.

541
00:40:41.613 --> 00:40:42.657
Mama!

542
00:40:42.701 --> 00:40:44.485
[woman]
Jordan!

543
00:40:44.529 --> 00:40:47.488
[people yelling. screaming]

544
00:40:47.532 --> 00:40:49.011
I'’m coming!

545
00:40:54.408 --> 00:40:55.627
[screams]

546
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.411
[Nora]
Like unplugging a computer

547
00:40:57.455 --> 00:40:59.195
when a program freezes.

548
00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:00.980
[Garrick]
Only when he pulls this plug.

549
00:41:01.023 --> 00:41:03.461
seven billion people
will go with him.

550
00:41:04.984 --> 00:41:07.769
Everything it kills
accelerates the process.

551
00:41:12.121 --> 00:41:15.864
God! Holy shit.
that felt freakin'’ real!

552
00:41:15.908 --> 00:41:18.824
Without you. none of us
would be here right now.

553
00:41:18.867 --> 00:41:20.173
What are you
talking about?

554
00:41:20.216 --> 00:41:22.871
Last cycle.
you raided Bathurst'’s lab.

555
00:41:22.915 --> 00:41:26.266
stole the Egg.
killed his Einstein and
everyone who helped build it.

556
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:28.398
leaving him with no way
to recreate it.

557
00:41:28.442 --> 00:41:31.924
You took the secret
of the Egg'’s whereabouts
to your grave.

558
00:41:31.967 --> 00:41:34.883
Bathurst spent
this entire lifetime
looking for it.

559
00:41:34.927 --> 00:41:38.408
And he'’s getting closer
and closer to finding it
every day.

560
00:41:38.452 --> 00:41:40.541
That'’s why he
tracked you down
in New York.

561
00:41:40.585 --> 00:41:43.196
So I get on the plane.
you get all my memories back.

562
00:41:43.239 --> 00:41:45.285
and I save
the whole entire world.
right? That'’s it?

563
00:41:45.328 --> 00:41:46.765
That'’s pretty much
basically it. right?

564
00:41:46.808 --> 00:41:48.680
Told you it was
gonna get weird.

565
00:41:48.723 --> 00:41:50.159
So. what now?

566
00:41:50.595 --> 00:41:52.292
[phone rings]

567
00:41:53.598 --> 00:41:55.774
Tell me good news. Nora.

568
00:41:55.817 --> 00:41:59.908
[Bathurst] Bryan Porter.
Treadway had a gift
with steel. didn'’t he?

569
00:41:59.952 --> 00:42:04.522
Impeccable. Your friends
in the NYPD were certainly
impressed with it.

570
00:42:04.565 --> 00:42:08.787
Unfortunately.
their encryption skills
are less than impeccable.

571
00:42:09.657 --> 00:42:11.485
Led us right to you.

572
00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:15.097
[screaming]

573
00:42:15.968 --> 00:42:19.145
[groaning]

574
00:42:21.713 --> 00:42:25.238
You do know we have easier ways
of doing things now. right?

575
00:42:25.847 --> 00:42:27.109
Newer...

576
00:42:27.893 --> 00:42:30.504
almost never means better.

577
00:42:39.513 --> 00:42:42.951
We'’re going to uncover
Evan McCauley'’s location.

578
00:42:42.995 --> 00:42:45.301
We'’ll brute-force
your encryption.

579
00:42:46.564 --> 00:42:50.306
But I'’d consider it...
a courtesy...

580
00:42:51.351 --> 00:42:52.395
if you just...

581
00:42:53.788 --> 00:42:55.398
sped the process up.

582
00:42:58.314 --> 00:43:00.186
[chuckles]
Tell us where he is.

583
00:43:01.622 --> 00:43:04.538
[groaning]

584
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.544
[coughing]
Okay.

585
00:43:11.893 --> 00:43:13.547
I know where he is.

586
00:43:14.635 --> 00:43:16.463
[coughing continues]

587
00:43:16.506 --> 00:43:17.595
Of course I do.

588
00:43:18.378 --> 00:43:22.121
I know exactly where he is.
I just...

589
00:43:25.037 --> 00:43:26.865
I. um...

590
00:43:26.908 --> 00:43:30.999
I sometimes have difficulties...

591
00:43:31.043 --> 00:43:32.740
[whispering] with my memory.

592
00:43:32.784 --> 00:43:33.959
[whispers]
Memory.

593
00:43:34.002 --> 00:43:35.656
[groans]I remember

594
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.006
when you used to
gather honey

595
00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:40.356
on the fields
of Marathon.

596
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.793
[groaning]

597
00:43:41.836 --> 00:43:46.406
Just another reminder
of how nothing
stays the same.

598
00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:49.191
[groans]

599
00:43:50.671 --> 00:43:51.890
[groaning]

600
00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:58.200
Would you care
for some?

601
00:44:03.075 --> 00:44:05.555
You know what
real torture is?

602
00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:06.992
Listening to you?

603
00:44:07.035 --> 00:44:12.127
[laughs] Real torture...
isn'’t physical pain.

604
00:44:12.171 --> 00:44:14.956
but human stupidity.

605
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.481
Being surrounded by it.
engulfed in it.

606
00:44:18.525 --> 00:44:21.267
[groans]Lifetime after lifetime.

607
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:25.140
[gurgling]People with their
idiot grins!

608
00:44:25.184 --> 00:44:27.708
Their infuriating
pleasantries!

609
00:44:27.752 --> 00:44:29.754
Their need for approval!

610
00:44:29.797 --> 00:44:33.627
Their unctuous attempts
to be loved and validated!

611
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:37.370
They are walking.
talking obituaries...

612
00:44:37.413 --> 00:44:40.590
[groaning]...on the back page
of a dying newspaper.

613
00:44:40.634 --> 00:44:44.551
at the bottom of a birdcage.
in the corner of
a filthy living room

614
00:44:44.594 --> 00:44:45.857
of a hoarder cat lady!

615
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.555
And we are forced...You'’ll never understand...

616
00:44:48.598 --> 00:44:51.863
...to live amongst them over......friendship. love.

617
00:44:51.906 --> 00:44:53.647
...and over endlessly.

618
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:56.041
That is the true...You still don'’t understand
about faith!

619
00:44:56.084 --> 00:44:57.738
...definition of torture.

620
00:44:57.782 --> 00:45:01.263
Faith! Blah. blah. blah!

621
00:45:01.307 --> 00:45:02.525
Faith!

622
00:45:03.613 --> 00:45:04.702
[whispers] Faith.

623
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:08.749
I'’m tired of faith.

624
00:45:08.793 --> 00:45:12.492
God must show me
his face.

625
00:45:25.897 --> 00:45:29.596
But thank you...
for enlightening me.

626
00:45:31.903 --> 00:45:33.513
[Porter screams. faint]

627
00:45:47.005 --> 00:45:49.224
You kept
his fucking body?

628
00:45:49.268 --> 00:45:50.704
Sexy son of a bitch.
isn'’t he?

629
00:45:50.748 --> 00:45:52.662
No. He'’s a dead guy
floating in water.

630
00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:54.621
That'’s pretty much
my worst nightmare.

631
00:45:54.664 --> 00:45:57.537
Actually.
it'’s a crotonic acid matrix.
Keeps the cells alive.

632
00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.713
Oh. That makes it
that much better.
Thank you.

633
00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:03.064
We'’re trying to understand
the science behind what we are.

634
00:46:05.414 --> 00:46:06.459
[beeps]

635
00:46:09.854 --> 00:46:14.336
[Nora] Treadway believed
that humans are capable of
so much more than we realized.

636
00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:17.383
[Evan] Is this what
you'’re telling me? I'm not
living up to my potential?

637
00:46:17.426 --> 00:46:19.428
I'’ve heard that speech before.

638
00:46:19.472 --> 00:46:23.781
[Garrick] Treadway pushed
past boundaries others might
call paranormal. superhuman.

639
00:46:23.824 --> 00:46:26.696
He can manipulate the energy
of the world around him.

640
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.394
[Evan] I don'’t even know
what that means.

641
00:46:28.437 --> 00:46:30.309
[Garrick] What it means
is you'’ll have skills

642
00:46:30.352 --> 00:46:33.007
beyond anything
you'’ve ever imagined.

643
00:46:33.051 --> 00:46:35.357
Those abilities
are very deep.

644
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:37.446
Below the conscious level.

645
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:40.928
[Evan] I'’m down.
How do we get them back?

646
00:46:40.972 --> 00:46:42.582
[grunting]

647
00:46:42.625 --> 00:46:45.019
[Nora] Here.
we retrain your memory.

648
00:46:45.063 --> 00:46:48.806
We combine the physical
and the mental to develop
new neural pathways.

649
00:46:57.292 --> 00:46:59.599
Memories are held
in every organ...

650
00:47:00.426 --> 00:47:02.254
every cell in your body.

651
00:47:10.915 --> 00:47:14.832
Regression takes
the kind of concentration
it takes years to develop.

652
00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:16.398
This is a shortcut.

653
00:47:17.356 --> 00:47:20.794
We shock your mind
into synching with the system.

654
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.673
[grunting]

655
00:47:31.065 --> 00:47:32.284
[yells]

656
00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:57.483
[Garrick] It'’s working.
I'’m seeing increased activity
in all his memory centers.

657
00:48:04.969 --> 00:48:06.884
[yells]

658
00:48:30.081 --> 00:48:31.343
Hey!

659
00:48:39.742 --> 00:48:41.527
[groaning]

660
00:48:48.099 --> 00:48:50.884
[grunts]Come on.

661
00:48:52.364 --> 00:48:54.844
That'’s not Treadway.Really?

662
00:48:54.888 --> 00:48:56.281
He just beat you.

663
00:48:56.324 --> 00:48:58.544
Treadway would'’ve killed me.

664
00:49:00.024 --> 00:49:01.329
[groans]

665
00:49:05.377 --> 00:49:10.077
Wow. She wasn'’t kidding
about being at war. huh?

666
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:12.732
Improving
the human condition.

667
00:49:12.775 --> 00:49:16.040
Sometimes you do it
by painting
a chapel ceiling.

668
00:49:16.083 --> 00:49:18.520
Yeah. And sometimes
you drop them
from a mile out.

669
00:49:18.564 --> 00:49:20.740
Don'’t touch that.

670
00:49:20.783 --> 00:49:22.394
Okay. okay.

671
00:49:25.701 --> 00:49:28.182
That'’s no gun
I'’ve ever seen before.

672
00:49:28.226 --> 00:49:31.881
We'’re reverse-engineering
Bathurst'’s Dethroner.

673
00:49:31.925 --> 00:49:36.277
A Dethroner?
I mean. dude. who'’s
coming up with these names?

674
00:49:36.321 --> 00:49:37.583
Look...

675
00:49:39.063 --> 00:49:41.152
you can'’t kill an Infinite.
You kill the body. but...

676
00:49:41.195 --> 00:49:44.242
And they get reincarnated?Yeah.

677
00:49:45.243 --> 00:49:48.637
This implants in your head

678
00:49:48.681 --> 00:49:51.423
and pulls out
your consciousness...

679
00:49:52.554 --> 00:49:55.427
your soul.
and onto a digital chip.

680
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.995
Your soul gets stuck on a disk
and breaks the cycle.

681
00:49:59.822 --> 00:50:02.956
Over 200 of our brothers
and sisters are lost

682
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.045
in that digital purgatory.

683
00:50:05.959 --> 00:50:08.570
[exhales]
You come face to face
with this.

684
00:50:08.614 --> 00:50:12.922
my advice--
find a way to die
the old-fashioned way.

685
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:18.015
[knocking]Come in.

686
00:50:22.323 --> 00:50:24.064
Okay if I look around?

687
00:50:24.108 --> 00:50:25.935
Be my guest.

688
00:50:45.303 --> 00:50:47.522
These are all you.
aren'’t they?

689
00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.656
They'’re people I once was.

690
00:50:52.005 --> 00:50:53.398
All of them.

691
00:50:56.096 --> 00:50:57.489
Wow.

692
00:50:57.532 --> 00:51:00.057
That'’s cool.
You look happy.

693
00:51:01.406 --> 00:51:03.016
I was.

694
00:51:04.148 --> 00:51:05.671
Who'’s that guy?

695
00:51:05.714 --> 00:51:08.543
In that picture.
he was Abel.

696
00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:14.245
Before then.
other names. other faces.

697
00:51:14.288 --> 00:51:15.942
But the soul...

698
00:51:16.682 --> 00:51:18.771
the soul was always him.

699
00:51:18.814 --> 00:51:21.904
So. what?
You loved each other
through multiple lives?

700
00:51:22.644 --> 00:51:24.820
These are all
the same place.

701
00:51:24.864 --> 00:51:28.085
Angkor Wat.
What we call the Beginning.

702
00:51:29.956 --> 00:51:33.177
I'’ll find you in the Beginning.

703
00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.700
[Abel] I love you.

704
00:51:34.743 --> 00:51:38.225
When each of us
would find ourselves
in a new life.

705
00:51:38.269 --> 00:51:39.879
this is where
Abel and I would go.

706
00:51:39.922 --> 00:51:42.577
You'’re reincarnated.
How would you know
where to go?

707
00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:47.365
Most of us have a reawakening
that begins young.

708
00:51:47.408 --> 00:51:49.976
Starts with small things.
memories.

709
00:51:50.019 --> 00:51:52.544
feelings about a place.
dreams.

710
00:51:53.197 --> 00:51:54.763
By puberty.

711
00:51:54.807 --> 00:51:56.852
most Infinites
have full recall.

712
00:51:56.896 --> 00:52:01.030
[scoffs] Right around
the time they diagnosed me
schizophrenic.

713
00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:04.512
So what happened
if you died young
and got separated?

714
00:52:04.556 --> 00:52:06.384
For an Infinite...

715
00:52:07.472 --> 00:52:09.648
death isn'’t the end.
it'’s like...

716
00:52:10.257 --> 00:52:12.564
turning the page in a book.

717
00:52:12.607 --> 00:52:15.567
Next chapter. same story.

718
00:52:16.394 --> 00:52:18.047
That'’s crazy.

719
00:52:18.091 --> 00:52:21.486
New lives. new bodies.
always meeting back
at the same place.

720
00:52:24.228 --> 00:52:25.403
He was Dethroned.

721
00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.495
He'’s trapped
on a computer
somewhere.

722
00:52:31.365 --> 00:52:35.108
My last life.
I got my memories back...

723
00:52:36.588 --> 00:52:38.546
and realized he was gone.

724
00:52:46.467 --> 00:52:48.948
It'’s not my memories
that matter. Evan.

725
00:52:50.602 --> 00:52:51.820
It'’s yours.

726
00:52:58.523 --> 00:53:01.439
Your last life.
in Mexico...

727
00:53:02.222 --> 00:53:04.442
where did you hide the Egg?

728
00:53:26.377 --> 00:53:28.161
[Bathurst]
Where'’s the Egg?

729
00:53:37.562 --> 00:53:39.651
Where is it?

730
00:53:48.921 --> 00:53:50.488
He'’s spiking.Shut it down.

731
00:53:51.489 --> 00:53:54.361
[groaning. panting]

732
00:53:54.405 --> 00:53:55.667
Hey. you'’re okay.[gasps]

733
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:58.278
You'’re okay. Hey.
Hey. just breathe.

734
00:53:58.322 --> 00:53:59.540
I need to get up.Breathe.

735
00:53:59.584 --> 00:54:01.107
[Garrick]
Kovic. check his vitals.

736
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:03.196
What happened in there. Evan?
What did you see?

737
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.894
Your neural network fired off
like the Fourth of July.

738
00:54:05.938 --> 00:54:09.420
I'’ve been seeing this stuff
all my life. It still
doesn'’t make any sense.

739
00:54:09.463 --> 00:54:10.812
Why can'’t he
remember anything?

740
00:54:10.856 --> 00:54:12.423
Between the car accident.
the electroshock

741
00:54:12.466 --> 00:54:15.774
and the steel plate in his head.
his mind is fractured.

742
00:54:15.817 --> 00:54:17.776
Something in there
won'’t let the memories flow.

743
00:54:17.819 --> 00:54:22.868
I can'’t get them out.
I'’m afraid the Artisan
is our last hope.

744
00:54:29.178 --> 00:54:31.616
He'’ll achieve recall soon.
[blows]

745
00:54:33.444 --> 00:54:35.141
If he hasn'’t already.

746
00:54:43.628 --> 00:54:45.934
Hundreds of lifetimes.

747
00:54:45.978 --> 00:54:48.894
and it all comes down
to these few hours.

748
00:54:50.983 --> 00:54:53.246
If we don'’t find him...

749
00:54:55.161 --> 00:54:58.120
before he gets
his memories back...

750
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.645
we lose the Egg...

751
00:55:02.124 --> 00:55:03.256
forever.

752
00:55:05.389 --> 00:55:07.216
The wheels keep turning

753
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.089
and we can never...

754
00:55:11.743 --> 00:55:13.658
escape.

755
00:55:17.749 --> 00:55:19.881
We go at dawn.

756
00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.873
[shouting]

757
00:55:55.613 --> 00:55:58.920
[alarm blaring]

758
00:56:03.447 --> 00:56:06.058
[machine powers down]

759
00:56:12.499 --> 00:56:14.675
It'’s been a while. Otto.

760
00:56:14.719 --> 00:56:19.854
No one'’s called me
by that name in...
so many lifetimes.

761
00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:30.822
Hello. my love.

762
00:56:32.301 --> 00:56:33.955
What happened to you?

763
00:56:35.435 --> 00:56:37.829
You were so beautiful.

764
00:56:38.656 --> 00:56:40.179
As were you.

765
00:56:40.614 --> 00:56:42.442
You don'’t miss it--

766
00:56:42.486 --> 00:56:44.183
the agility...

767
00:56:44.923 --> 00:56:46.185
the vibrancy...

768
00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.796
being confined to this?

769
00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:52.104
You see me
as something broken.
I don'’t.

770
00:56:53.061 --> 00:56:55.629
You'’re the cripple. Otto.

771
00:56:55.673 --> 00:56:57.979
Crippled by your cowardice.Cowardice?

772
00:56:58.023 --> 00:57:03.115
No. I'’m crippled
by my memory.

773
00:57:03.158 --> 00:57:07.119
You get your memories back
over years. Not me.

774
00:57:07.162 --> 00:57:11.297
I get it all back
as my brain forms.
In the womb.

775
00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:16.737
Endless hours.
days. weeks. months.

776
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:18.130
No room to move!

777
00:57:18.173 --> 00:57:20.654
Nothing
for my brain to do

778
00:57:20.698 --> 00:57:23.048
but eat itself.

779
00:57:23.091 --> 00:57:26.747
All these lifetimes.
the magnitude of this gift.

780
00:57:26.791 --> 00:57:29.315
and you haven'’t
learned a thing.

781
00:57:29.358 --> 00:57:30.925
I have to get out.

782
00:57:31.883 --> 00:57:33.450
I have to make it stop.

783
00:57:34.363 --> 00:57:38.193
Don'’t do it.
Don'’t give him anything.

784
00:57:39.456 --> 00:57:40.935
Where is Treadway?

785
00:57:47.725 --> 00:57:49.770
We storming the beach
at Normandy?

786
00:57:49.814 --> 00:57:52.077
You never know
with the Artisan.

787
00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:54.383
Let'’s get ready.

788
00:58:29.767 --> 00:58:31.072
[man]
Color out. please.

789
00:58:31.116 --> 00:58:33.379
[chattering. laughing]

790
00:58:34.685 --> 00:58:36.861
So. the Artisan'’s
a gambler?

791
00:58:36.904 --> 00:58:38.427
No. he'’s a hedonist.

792
00:58:38.471 --> 00:58:41.822
Infinite lies.
infinite opportunity
for debauchery.

793
00:58:41.866 --> 00:58:43.781
Sounds like
my kinda guy.

794
00:58:57.098 --> 00:58:58.970
[speaking Tibetan]

795
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.916
[speakers:
opera music playing]

796
00:59:34.179 --> 00:59:37.443
[opera continues playing][sighs]

797
00:59:37.486 --> 00:59:40.141
Alexa. music off.[music stops]

798
00:59:40.185 --> 00:59:42.753
Get him cleaned up
and outta here.

799
00:59:42.796 --> 00:59:44.972
You'’re operating
on dead guys now?

800
00:59:45.016 --> 00:59:47.496
Da Vinci used to
cut into human cadavers

801
00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:50.630
so that he could
better understand
the human form.

802
00:59:50.674 --> 00:59:54.068
For me. I'’m all about
that brain. baby.

803
00:59:54.112 --> 00:59:58.333
[laughing]
But you know that
all too well.

804
00:59:58.377 --> 01:00:03.034
Oh. what a beautiful
cranial arch you got
this time around.

805
01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:07.473
I could better examine it
if I severed your head
from your neck.

806
01:00:07.516 --> 01:00:09.867
Like Treadway did to me
when last we met.

807
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.825
Try it.Oh.

808
01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:14.045
Bathurst took the Hub.

809
01:00:16.874 --> 01:00:19.006
Does he have the Egg?No.

810
01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:21.400
Think we'’d be here
if he did?

811
01:00:22.706 --> 01:00:26.144
Wherever it is.
it'’s still in his head.

812
01:00:27.885 --> 01:00:28.929
Treadway?

813
01:00:28.973 --> 01:00:31.279
So they say.

814
01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:35.022
Wait. Is he blocked?

815
01:00:35.066 --> 01:00:36.894
[laughing]

816
01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:39.723
Well. well. well.
look at this.

817
01:00:39.766 --> 01:00:40.985
Huh.

818
01:00:41.812 --> 01:00:45.380
So. your hard drive
got fragged.

819
01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:48.557
which means we'’re gonna
have to reset your memory.

820
01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:53.606
And. Heinrich. I gotta tell ya.
I'’m really gonna enjoy this.

821
01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:56.087
Ooh! [laughing]

822
01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:57.741
Check this out.

823
01:00:58.263 --> 01:01:00.395
[machine powers up]

824
01:01:00.439 --> 01:01:03.398
You'’re all familiar
with the idea
that when you die.

825
01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:06.619
your life flashes
before your eyes. right?

826
01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:09.883
This machine
enhances that experience.

827
01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:12.190
prolonging
your sense of time.

828
01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:17.282
allowing you
to restore or reorder
everything inside.

829
01:01:17.325 --> 01:01:24.332
This-- This right here
is the closest you'’re gonna get
to a total mental reboot.

830
01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:25.420
[laughs]

831
01:01:25.464 --> 01:01:26.944
Are you planning
on trying to drown me?

832
01:01:26.987 --> 01:01:28.336
'’Cause I got a thing
about drowning.

833
01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.599
Which is?I don'’t like it!

834
01:01:30.643 --> 01:01:33.733
What kind of success rate
is this guy working with.
anyway?

835
01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:36.257
Confidence is... high.

836
01:01:36.301 --> 01:01:39.086
Yeah. and so are you.
obviously.

837
01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.827
[laughing] Okay. Hey.

838
01:01:40.871 --> 01:01:43.264
I like you this time around.
You'’re actually funny.

839
01:01:43.308 --> 01:01:47.878
Don'’t take this the wrong way.
but you'’re usually
kind of a jerk.

840
01:01:47.921 --> 01:01:49.531
It'’s true.Yeah. she gets it.

841
01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:51.664
So. I'’m supposed
to trust this guy?

842
01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.448
I wouldn'’t.First.

843
01:01:53.492 --> 01:01:55.233
I resent
the gender labeling.

844
01:01:55.276 --> 01:01:58.627
Second. you can trust
that we share the same goal.

845
01:01:58.671 --> 01:02:00.238
Really? Which is?

846
01:02:00.281 --> 01:02:03.807
Bathurst wants to what.
destroy every living thing
on Earth?

847
01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:07.636
Well. that'’s gonna ruin
a pretty great party
I'’ve got goin' on here.

848
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.726
This guy'’s out of his mind.
Hey--

849
01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:13.860
There'’s a reason you
didn'’t bring me here before.Mmm.

850
01:02:13.904 --> 01:02:16.689
I could die in there.Yeah.

851
01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:19.518
[Evan] Could it work?

852
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.695
It could.

853
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:26.481
But you have a choice.
Evan.

854
01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:28.745
No. I don'’t have a choice.

855
01:02:29.528 --> 01:02:31.878
I... I can'’t let
anybody else get hurt

856
01:02:31.922 --> 01:02:33.750
because of what'’s in my head.

857
01:02:43.107 --> 01:02:45.500
All right.
Leap-of-faith time.

858
01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:49.243
Let'’s just do it now
before I change my mind.
All right?

859
01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:51.855
Let'’s go.
Turn your machine on.

860
01:02:51.898 --> 01:02:53.508
Ooh. Ready to go for a swim?

861
01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:56.076
Yes.
This is gonna be so fun!

862
01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.078

All the souls.

1048
01:25:52.582 --> 01:25:55.150
We have to free them all.

1049
01:25:55.193 --> 01:25:57.413
Whoa! [grunts]

1050
01:25:57.456 --> 01:25:59.328

Stay with me. okay?
We are so close.

1052

1055

1060
01:28:06.759 --> 01:28:09.022
It'’s impossible.

1061
01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:12.112
I-Impossible.

You disappoint me.

1066
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:23.053
No recognition
whatsoever. huh?

1067
01:29:23.749 --> 01:29:25.229
I think I should feel hurt.

1068
01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:30.277

Not for us.

01:33:14.371 --> 01:33:16.721
Maybe not for any of us.

1083
01:33:16.765 --> 01:33:19.202
New chapter. same story.

1084
01:33:20.899 --> 01:33:22.422
I can carry you out.

1085
01:33:22.858 --> 01:33:24.076
No way.

1086
01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.209

[Abel] I love you.

1092
01:34:08.904 --> 01:34:10.470
[Evan] I ask myself...

1093
01:34:11.254 --> 01:34:14.213
what did being Evan McCauley
teach me?

1094
01:34:17.434 --> 01:34:19.958
[crying]

1095
01:34:20.002 --> 01:34:23.527
[Evan] If each new life
is a chance to build
on what was.

1096
01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:26.661
a chance to press forward
to the best of what could be...

1097
01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:30.752
Go. go. go!

1098
01:34:30.795 --> 01:34:33.711
...why will some of us
have to pick up the sword
and fight again...

a new beginning?

Nora?

1103
01:35:12.445 --> 01:35:15.361
[Evan] It'’s hope.
That'’s what I learned.

1104
01:35:15.405 --> 01:35:18.756
Yes. we fall.
Yes. we fail.

1105
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:21.628
Yes. sometimes we screw up
everything we touch.

1106
01:35:21.672 --> 01:35:24.327
But each moment we live
is connected by a belief

1107
01:35:24.370 --> 01:35:29.767
that the actions we take will
next day. next week. next life

1108
01:35:29.811 --> 01:35:31.551
add up to something more.

1109
01:35:31.595 --> 01:35:34.163
something bigger
than yourself.

1110
01:35:50.353 --> 01:35:54.226
And next... well.
the possibilities are...

1111
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:56.576
