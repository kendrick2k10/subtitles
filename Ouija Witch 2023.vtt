00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:15.557
(metallic droning)

4
00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:24.733
(bright orchestral music)

5
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.405
(film reel whirring)

6
00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.785
(bright electronic music)

7
00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:50.342
(ominous music)

8
00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.099
(crickets chirping)

9
00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.069
[Laura] Stop moving it!

10
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.236
[Viola] I'm not moving it.

11
00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:11.821
I thought you were moving it.

12
00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.239
[Laura] No.

13
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.075
- [Viola] Then it
must be the spirits.

14
00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.118
- [Laura] Please
try and be serious.

15
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.453
[Viola] Okay. fine.

16
00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.289
- Are there any
spirits here with us?

17
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.750
That's it! We're done!

18
00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:25.126
Do it yourself!

19
00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:26.753
- Laura! You know I
need you for safety.

20
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.214
The devil's not gonna
fuck with a virgin.

21
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.052
Okay. fine. I was
totally moving it.

22
00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:35.720
It's not funny. Viola!

23
00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.222
How are we supposed
to contact anyone

24
00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.057
if you're messing
around with it?

25
00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.142
Relax. It's just a game.

26
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.688
Where did you get this
one? It looks really old.

27
00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.315
- [Laura] It was this
weird store in town.

28
00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.776
You think it actually works?

29
00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:50.902
Yeah. I kind of do.

30
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.323
I used it last night and
someone came through.

31
00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:56.157
(Viola scoffs)

32
00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.117
As if!

33
00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:58.159
I'm serious.

34
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.203
Oh yeah? Who'd you contact?

35
00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:01.788
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

36
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.622
Too late.

37
00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:05.959
I think it was Mary Blackwood.

38
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:07.419
The witch of Hazel Street?

39
00:02:09.004 --> 00:02:10.296
Okay. fine.

40
00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:12.757
Let's see what the old
hag has to say tonight.

41
00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.467
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

42
00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.261
(planchette slides)

43
00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.556
(suspenseful music)

44
00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:23.518
- We want to speak to the
spirit of Mary Blackwood.

45
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.229
Are you there?

46
00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:29.524
(eerie music)

47
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.153
(low thud)

48
00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:34.237
You heard that?

49
00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.363
Most definitely.

50
00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:37.365
No one else is home?

51
00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:41.244
(eerie music)

52
00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.207
Are all the doors walked?

53
00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.459
I think so.

54
00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.503
It could be Tim! He said
he was gonna stop by.

55
00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:53.173
I wouldn't put it past
him to try and scare us.

56
00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:54.507
- And when were
you gonna tell me

57
00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.676
you took that trifling
man whore back?

58
00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.720
- He promised me the
rumors weren't true.

59
00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.180
Oh. he promised?

60
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.016
Because he's always been nothing
but 100% percent truthful

61
00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.684
since you met him.

62
00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.061
I know you don't like him.

63
00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.645
(Viola sighs)

64
00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.357
- Sweetie. I know he looks like
he got off the casting couch

65
00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:11.816
of Dawson's Creek.

66
00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.611
but he has the personality
of a box of hair.

67
00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:17.197
(low thud)

68
00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.991
Come on. let's call his bluff.

69
00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.493
What if it's not him?

70
00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.287
What if it's something else?

71
00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.581
Like who? Mary Blackwood?

72
00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:28.541
(thud)

73
00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.753
(suspenseful music)

74
00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.109
(Tim shouts)
(Viola and Laura scream)

75
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.276
(Tim laughing)

76
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.194
Tim!

77
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.570
So original. Timothy.

78
00:03:57.612 --> 00:03:58.905
It worked on you. Vi.

79
00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:00.615
- What the hell
are you doing here?

80
00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:03.076
- I came to steal my girlfriend
back from your clutches.

81
00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:03.993
(Viola scoffs)

82
00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:04.828
Which girlfriend?

83
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:05.954
V. stop!

84
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.168
- I didn't know you girls
were raising the dead.

85
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.086
(eerie music)

86
00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:14.462
[Viola] Sure are.

87
00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.756
You gonna join us ore
are you too scared?

88
00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:17.632
Let's do it.

89
00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:19.259
Tim. no. you don't have to.

90
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.802
Come on. babe. It'll be fun.

91
00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:23.596
Who we contacting?

92
00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.515
The witch. Mary Blackwood.

93
00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.308
- Yeah. I thought she
was an urban legend.

94
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.643
No. it's public record.

95
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:30.603
The people of the town
hanged her from the tree

96
00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:33.273
and then burned
her body to ashes.

97
00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:34.482
All right.

98
00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:37.777
Come on. Mary Blackwood.

99
00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.405
take a break from
being Satan's whore

100
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.533
and show us that
hagged face of yours.

101
00:04:43.575 --> 00:04:44.409
(eerie music)

102
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.410
(all gasp)

103
00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.454
I didn't do it. I swear.

104
00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:50.415
(Laura shrieks)

105
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.460
- Relax. It was probably
just your breaker.

106
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.587
Where's your fuse box?

107
00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:58.006
In the attic.

108
00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:58.965
Of course it is.

109
00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.470
Tim. no. maybe you shouldn't!

110
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.139
(Tim chuckles)

111
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:08.683
(eerie music)

112
00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.862
(ominous music)

113
00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.704
Hello? Is someone there?

114
00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:38.088
(suspenseful music)

115
00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.508
Laura. are you okay?

116
00:05:41.549 --> 00:05:43.635
- When I used the
board last night.

117
00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:46.471
I just wanted to know if
Tim was cheating on me.

118
00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:47.722
What'd it say?

119
00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:50.183
It said yes.

120
00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.518
See?

121
00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.103
Even a dead witch
knows he's trash.

122
00:05:54.562 --> 00:05:58.191
- I was so mad. I told her
I wanted Tim to be dead.

123
00:05:58.233 --> 00:05:59.484
(viola scoffs)

124
00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.444
- Same. girl.
What's the problem?

125
00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:05.949
(suspenseful music)

126
00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:26.761
- Last night I had a
dream that he was dead.

127
00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:30.015
killed by the witch.
and it felt so real.

128
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.643
It's fine.

129
00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.478
It was just a dream.

130
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.312
(Tim screams)

131
00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.605
Tim!

132
00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.066
- Laura. he's just
messing with us.

133
00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:42.152
Tim. this isn't funny!

134
00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.947
(ominous music)

135
00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.138
(Laura screams)

136
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.139
No!

137
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.432
It's her!

138
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.977
It's the witch! (sobbing)

139
00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.689
(eerie music)

140
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.779
(ghostly whispering)

141
00:08:31.428 --> 00:08:34.681
(ghostly voices)

142
00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:37.892
(suspenseful music)

143
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:45.692
(witch laughing)

144
00:08:53.408 --> 00:08:54.576
Who are you?

145
00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.121
(suspenseful music)

146
00:08:58.163 --> 00:09:01.041
(Laura screams)

147
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:10.925
(Viola screams)

148
00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.597
(dramatic music)

149
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.341
(tense music)

150
00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:44.185
(phone buzzing)

151
00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:53.319
(electronic music)

152
00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.163
* Falling in two
falling for you *

153
00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.915
* This invented madness *

154
00:11:05.957 --> 00:11:08.585
* Falling in two
falling for you *

155
00:11:08.626 --> 00:11:11.129
* This invented madness *

156
00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:13.923
* Falling in two
falling for you *

157
00:11:13.965 --> 00:11:16.301
* This invented madness *

158
00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:19.554
* Falling in two
falling for you *

159
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:21.931
* This invented madness *

160
00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.517
(music fades)

161
00:11:24.559 --> 00:11:25.602
(Viola yawns)

162
00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:26.936
Oh. good morning. Sarah.

163
00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:28.980
Morning. Viola.

164
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:33.026
- Oh. I guess "mom" is
too formal these days.

165
00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:36.029
Morning. mother. Better?

166
00:11:36.071 --> 00:11:37.155
Yeah.

167
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:39.866
Can I make you a little
coffee? Something?

168
00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:41.368
- That's okay. I
have to get to work.

169
00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:43.203
- Ugh. I get so
worried about you

170
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:44.871
working at that bar so late.

171
00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:47.040
I wish you could
find something else.

172
00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:49.042
- Yeah. well. I
don't love it either.

173
00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:51.378
but how else am I gonna
get a place of my own?

174
00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:52.962
- Yeah. I know you're
really not happy

175
00:11:53.004 --> 00:11:54.506
about being back here.

176
00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:57.425
I'm sure your stepmom's
place was so much bigger.

177
00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.804
- It was. but I kind
of got the feeling

178
00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:02.931
she wanted me out of
there as soon as possible.

179
00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.016
What makes you say that?

180
00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.393
- She told me she
wanted me out of there

181
00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:07.435
as soon as possible.

182
00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:09.938
That rotten woman.

183
00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:11.940
To her own stepdaughter?

184
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.900
Mom. it's fine.

185
00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.902
No. it's not fine!

186
00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.237
I'm gonna call her.

187
00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:20.031
I'm gonna give her
a piece of my mind!

188
00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.283
Just forget about it.

189
00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:25.203
She said I remind
her too much of him.

190
00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:29.416
Honey. I'm sorry.

191
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:32.502
Okay. I have to get to work.

192
00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:40.176
(anxious music)

193
00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:02.323
(ominous music)

194
00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:19.174
(eerie music)

195
00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.396
(upbeat rock music)

196
00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:35.315
- He was like. "Bro. I
heard all that screaming

197
00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:36.524
in the room and everything."

198
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:37.984
I was like. "Yeah. that was me."

199
00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:41.112
(all laughing)

200
00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:42.697
- Now you need to rub
some of that charisma off

201
00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:43.907
on my little brother here.

202
00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.241
- Oh. it's definitely
coming. man.

203
00:13:45.283 --> 00:13:46.993
It's going on tonight.
Ain't that right. baby?

204
00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.161
- Yeah. You ready to pop
that cherry. little brother?

205
00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.662
[Brother] I don't know.

206
00:13:49.704 --> 00:13:50.663
- [Caleb] I'm gonna
get 'em together.

207
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:51.998
Don't you worry about this. man.

208
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.333
I'm gonna get some titties
in your face. okay?

209
00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:55.001
- Great! How long
have they been here?

210
00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.920
- Long enough to make me
thankful I'm not a breeder.

211
00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.963
We should all be so lucky.

212
00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:02.008
And. tag. you're it.

213
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.718
Don't do me any favors.

214
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.220
I'll be your best friend.

215
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.305
Your very. very best friend.

216
00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:09.974
You're already my only friend.

217
00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:13.853
Hey. guys.

218
00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:14.854
Good to see you. Sarah.

219
00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:15.897
Hi. Eric.

220
00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:18.066
Sarah. our favorite beer witch.

221
00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:20.694
- Clever. Caleb. Never
heard that one before.

222
00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.112
Oh. come on. darling.

223
00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:23.279
You don't have to be so uptight.

224
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:24.572
What's the matter?
Need to get laid?

225
00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:25.490
(slaps butt)
(Sarah gasps)

226
00:14:25.532 --> 00:14:26.408
Hey. come on. Isaac!

227
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:27.617
Hey. hey! (laughing)

228
00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:29.202
I was just offering
my services. (laughs)

229
00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:30.995
I'd rather join a convent.

230
00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:32.914
Asshole.

231
00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:35.500
Is that funny to you?

232
00:14:35.542 --> 00:14:37.127
"You asshole!"

233
00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:38.670
(slams down bottles)

234
00:14:38.712 --> 00:14:43.091
- Look. I'm sorry about
him. He's he's just drunk.

235
00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:46.094
- I didn't realize that
was an excuse for assault.

236
00:14:46.761 --> 00:14:48.263
I didn't mean to say it was.

237
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:51.224
Are we done here. Derek?

238
00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:54.394
- Look. I just wanna say
I'm really glad you're back.

239
00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:57.397
You know. after you
left for New York.

240
00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.191
I just never thought
I'd see you again.

241
00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:02.485
- Things didn't
exactly go as planned.

242
00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:05.238
- I'm sorry to hear
about your dad.

243
00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.906
He was a really good guy.

244
00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:08.283
Thanks.

245
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.367
He was.

246
00:15:10.285 --> 00:15:12.245
You staying with your mom?

247
00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:15.081
- For now. until I
find a place of my own.

248
00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.207
How is she?

249
00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:18.084
You know. last I
heard she was...

250
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.336
She's doing just fine.

251
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.135
[Derek] Fuck.

252
00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:30.138
(upbeat music)
(patrons chattering)

253
00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.931
Oh. Sarah!

254
00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.266
Hey!

255
00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:34.559
Hey. my little baby
brother Asher here.

256
00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:35.769
and he needs a date.

257
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.103
You know anyone you
can hook him up with?

258
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:38.104
(Asher laughs uncomfortably)

259
00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.105
He's joking. I don't...

260
00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:39.856
I don't need help.

261
00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:41.399
Oh. nonsense!

262
00:15:41.441 --> 00:15:42.817
Hey! (muttering)

263
00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.110
No. no. no. He's right.

264
00:15:44.152 --> 00:15:46.696
Hey. but listen. no good girls.

265
00:15:46.738 --> 00:15:48.198
They ain't no fun.

266
00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.533
- No. we need someone who's
gonna keep him on his toes.

267
00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:53.119
A real witch. one
might say. (laughing)

268
00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:54.245
Isaac. stop.

269
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.040
No one asked you. Derek.

270
00:15:58.291 --> 00:15:59.751
What do you say. Sarah?

271
00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:02.379
Think your mother still has
Mary Blackwood's number?

272
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.381
Or we could just dust
off the old Ouija board

273
00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.174
and get your dad to
grab it for us. (laughs)

274
00:16:06.216 --> 00:16:07.550
Isaac. that's enough!

275
00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:09.094
It's okay. Derek.

276
00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.136
I'm sorry. Isaac.

277
00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.680
but the only single girl I know

278
00:16:11.721 --> 00:16:13.556
is my good friend
Liz over there.

279
00:16:15.475 --> 00:16:16.935
(Liz blows kiss)

280
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:18.353
Ugh.

281
00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.230
- But I'm pretty sure her
dick is bigger than yours.

282
00:16:20.271 --> 00:16:21.481
(Caleb laughs)

283
00:16:21.523 --> 00:16:22.315
[Caleb] Shit!

284
00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.318
All of yours. in fact.

285
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.987
- Oh. shit. is that
right? (laughs)

286
00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:28.738
You wanna find out?

287
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.989
(Isaac chuckles)

288
00:16:30.031 --> 00:16:31.324
- Caleb. if I wanted
your comeback.

289
00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:33.159
I'd scrape it off the
back of Isaac's throat.

290
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.327
The fuck?

291
00:16:34.369 --> 00:16:35.495
(chair slides)
(bottle slams)

292
00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:36.121
Stupid!

293
00:16:36.162 --> 00:16:36.955
(glass shatters)

294
00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.498
Hey!

295
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.125
That's enough!

296
00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:41.501
You boys. you're outta here.

297
00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.128
- We haven't finished
our drinks yet!

298
00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:44.337
Oh. these?

299
00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:45.171
(slams tables)
(bottles clatter)

300
00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.089
Jesus Christ!

301
00:16:46.131 --> 00:16:47.173
Out now. all of you!

302
00:16:47.882 --> 00:16:49.300
What the fuck?

303
00:16:49.342 --> 00:16:51.052
This ain't over!

304
00:16:51.094 --> 00:16:52.178
Not by a long shot.

305
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.014
Okay. Liz.

306
00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.098
Sorry.

307
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:00.895
(Liz sighs)

308
00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:03.523
(door bangs)

309
00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:05.442
Hey. you okay?

310
00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:07.485
I'm fine.

311
00:17:09.404 --> 00:17:13.199
- Sometimes it's okay
to just not be fine.

312
00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:17.203
Sometimes it's okay
to scream or cry

313
00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.330
or punch someone in the teeth

314
00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:21.416
'cause they slightly
inconvenienced you.

315
00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:24.502
- Just being back here
and serving guys like that

316
00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:27.088
makes me feel like
such a failure.

317
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.258
- Honey. most of those
boys have had an easy life

318
00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.093
because of their families.

319
00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:34.512
You've been through hell
and seen the other side.

320
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.183
That's a success. not a failure.

321
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.810
- I haven't thought
of it like that.

322
00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:46.399
Every time my mom looks at me.

323
00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:48.777
it makes me feel like
she's judging me too.

324
00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:53.323
- Sarah. I'm not gonna
tell you what to do.

325
00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:56.284
but my parents kicked
me out when I was 18.

326
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:58.370
I never spoke to them again.

327
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.872
Your mom wants to
be in your life.

328
00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:02.207
What are you afraid of?

329
00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:06.086
I guess I'm still embarrassed.

330
00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:09.381
Hey. you're over a year sober.

331
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.634
something to be proud
of. not embarrassed by.

332
00:18:14.844 --> 00:18:17.764
- I'm still learning how to
be around people. you know?

333
00:18:17.806 --> 00:18:19.182
Yes.

334
00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:22.686
No one gets that more
than I do. believe me.

335
00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:27.982
But this whole self-deprecation.
self-isolation bull shit.

336
00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:29.776
it's not gonna make
anything better.

337
00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.614
- You're always
right. You know that?

338
00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:35.615
Yeah. I do.

339
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.578
(eerie music)

340
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.052
Ride home?

341
00:18:56.094 --> 00:18:57.512
No thanks. I like the walk.

342
00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:01.016
You're out of my way anyway.

343
00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:01.850
Get home safe.

344
00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:08.898
(fire truck siren wailing)

345
00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.704
(tense music)

346
00:19:34.883 --> 00:19:37.761
(gravel crunching)

347
00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.022
Hey! Whoa. whoa. whoa!

348
00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:49.939
It's just me.

349
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.524
Derek! What the hell?

350
00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:52.817
- It's a good thing you're
not too trigger happy

351
00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:54.110
with that thing.

352
00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:55.445
- Why would you
sneak up on a woman

353
00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:57.864
walking home alone in
the middle of the night?

354
00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:01.409
- I was just trying
to catch up with you.

355
00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:02.577
Sorry I scared you.

356
00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.082
- Well. I'm not sorry I
almost burnt your eyes out.

357
00:20:07.123 --> 00:20:09.042
Not even a little bit?

358
00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:10.377
Maybe just a smidge.

359
00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.420
What do you want?

360
00:20:12.462 --> 00:20:17.592
- Look. I just wanna
apologize for my friends.

361
00:20:19.219 --> 00:20:20.595
You know. they're douche bags.

362
00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:23.431
You are the company you keep.

363
00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:27.435
Okay. I deserve that.

364
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:32.315
Why do you hang out with them?

365
00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:34.192
It must be exhausting.

366
00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:37.737
- I mean. it is. but I don't
really have anyone else.

367
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.323
Asher's been there
since the sandbox.

368
00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:42.992
and Isaac's always
looked out for us.

369
00:20:44.452 --> 00:20:47.122
- It's okay to
outgrow your friends.

370
00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:49.332
Yeah. but it's not that easy.

371
00:20:49.374 --> 00:20:52.002
Isaac's dad gave me a job
with the construction company.

372
00:20:52.043 --> 00:20:53.545
so it's not really wise

373
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.880
to get on the wrong
side of the family.

374
00:20:56.881 --> 00:21:00.051
But maybe if I had someone
else to hang out with.

375
00:21:01.886 --> 00:21:03.763
Are you asking me out?

376
00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:04.973
That's so sweet.

377
00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:07.934
No.

378
00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:09.644
Wait. what?

379
00:21:09.686 --> 00:21:11.062
Why?

380
00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:13.773
- Because you asked me
to eighth grade formal

381
00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:16.026
and then dumped me
for Julie Henderson

382
00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:18.695
when you found out she
Frenches on the first date.

383
00:21:19.988 --> 00:21:23.033
- I have to make it up to
you then. if you'll let me.

384
00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:28.538
- Kind of just been trying
to do me recently. you know?

385
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.999
No. I've been doing me too.

386
00:21:32.083 --> 00:21:33.376
Every night. in fact.

387
00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:37.464
A masturbation joke. Clever.

388
00:21:37.505 --> 00:21:38.798
Thank you.

389
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.051
I've been work-shopping
it. What do you think?

390
00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:45.013
- I'd avoided it
as a pickup line.

391
00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:48.975
- Look. I just wanna say I
am really glad you're back.

392
00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:49.809
(car approaching)

393
00:21:49.851 --> 00:21:51.227
(tense music)

394
00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:54.022
(car doors open)

395
00:21:57.025 --> 00:22:00.070
(beer can crunching)

396
00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:02.906
Oh. isn't that cute?

397
00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:05.825
The hell do you guys want?

398
00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:08.411
- Hey. man. we just wanna
offer the lady our apologies

399
00:22:08.453 --> 00:22:10.663
for the misunderstanding
earlier. that's all.

400
00:22:10.705 --> 00:22:12.499
Save your breath.

401
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.918
- Just get back
in the car. guys.

402
00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:16.878
Oh. no can do. Romeo.

403
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.047
We have unfinished
business with Sarah.

404
00:22:21.174 --> 00:22:23.593
You think you can just
treat us like shit

405
00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:24.844
and get away with it?

406
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.430
I call 'em like. I see 'em.

407
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:29.182
Don't touch her!

408
00:22:29.224 --> 00:22:30.767
Hey. where the fuck you going?

409
00:22:30.809 --> 00:22:33.520
Motherfucker!
(punch lands)

410
00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:34.854
Hoo-hoo! Shit!

411
00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:36.106
God damn!

412
00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:39.609
I always knew he was
thick-headed. (laughing)

413
00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:41.986
(dramatic music)

414
00:22:42.028 --> 00:22:44.698
(mace sprays)

415
00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:46.157
(Isaac chuckles)

416
00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:47.784
Cute.

417
00:22:47.826 --> 00:22:50.787
Not so tough without your
little girlfriend around. huh?

418
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.581
Hey. Asher!

419
00:22:53.623 --> 00:22:55.625
Get over here little brother.

420
00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:57.585
My friend here
looks a bit thirsty.

421
00:22:58.753 --> 00:23:01.798
- Yeah. I think she
could use a drink.

422
00:23:13.435 --> 00:23:14.894
I am a bit thirsty.

423
00:23:17.647 --> 00:23:19.065
(bottle shatters)
(Isaac grunts)

424
00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:22.402
(dramatic music)

425
00:23:22.444 --> 00:23:23.737
Fucking bitch!

426
00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:25.280
Get her!

427
00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:27.741
Come on. come on. come on!

428
00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:33.538
Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

429
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.499
(dramatic music)

430
00:23:44.924 --> 00:23:45.675
Bitch!

431
00:23:50.597 --> 00:23:52.766
Where the fuck'd she go?

432
00:23:52.807 --> 00:23:55.685
(suspenseful music)

433
00:23:55.727 --> 00:23:56.811
Behind you!

434
00:23:56.853 --> 00:24:01.775
(kick lands)
(Caleb groans)

435
00:24:02.525 --> 00:24:03.610
Whoa. whoa. hey. hey.

436
00:24:03.651 --> 00:24:04.778
Hey. no. no. please. God. no!

437
00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:06.738
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

438
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.031
I didn't wanna do this.

439
00:24:08.073 --> 00:24:11.326
I just want the guys
to accept me. (panting)

440
00:24:11.368 --> 00:24:12.619
(Asher grunts)

441
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.580
(dramatic music)

442
00:24:20.335 --> 00:24:21.544
(suspenseful music)

443
00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:23.672
(Sarah gasps)

444
00:24:23.713 --> 00:24:26.257
(punch lands)

445
00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:27.300
Hey. that's enough. Isaac.

446
00:24:27.342 --> 00:24:29.219
Keep him over there!

447
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.971
(tense music)

448
00:24:33.682 --> 00:24:36.685
(Isaac shouts)
(kick lands)

449
00:24:36.726 --> 00:24:37.519
(Isaac shouts)
(kick lands)

450
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.478
(Sarah groans)

451
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.106
(kick lands)

452
00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:42.774
(Sarah groans)

453
00:24:42.816 --> 00:24:44.818
No smart-ass comment this time?

454
00:24:46.861 --> 00:24:48.321
- Come on. man.
Let's get outta here.

455
00:24:48.363 --> 00:24:49.739
I'm not done yet.

456
00:24:49.781 --> 00:24:51.157
Isaac. come on. man!

457
00:24:51.199 --> 00:24:52.701
Let's go!

458
00:24:52.742 --> 00:24:54.202
You wanted to teach her a
lesson. and you did. all right?

459
00:24:54.244 --> 00:24:55.578
You proved your point!

460
00:24:57.455 --> 00:24:59.958
(tense music)

461
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:07.048
(belt rattles)

462
00:25:11.594 --> 00:25:13.888
(siren wailing)

463
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.893
Shit.

464
00:25:25.108 --> 00:25:28.319
- I think that's a sign from
above to get out of here.

465
00:25:28.361 --> 00:25:29.821
Look. I'm with him. Isaac.

466
00:25:29.863 --> 00:25:31.573
Let's get outta here. man.

467
00:25:33.742 --> 00:25:35.618
- Fine.
(belt rattles)

468
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.704
(fly zips)

469
00:25:37.746 --> 00:25:39.122
(Isaac spits)

470
00:25:39.164 --> 00:25:42.083
(Sarah panting)

471
00:25:46.254 --> 00:25:49.674
(dramatic music)

472
00:25:49.716 --> 00:25:52.052
- Hey. what are we
gonna do about Derek?

473
00:25:52.927 --> 00:25:54.846
Let's get him in the car.

474
00:25:54.888 --> 00:25:56.431
Watch your ass.

475
00:25:56.473 --> 00:25:57.307
Get up!

476
00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.353
Get your ass up. man!

477
00:26:01.394 --> 00:26:04.064
(dramatic music)

478
00:26:12.614 --> 00:26:15.617
(train rattling)

479
00:26:21.414 --> 00:26:23.583
(train horn blares)

480
00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:26.378
(dramatic music)

481
00:26:55.156 --> 00:26:57.951
(delicate music)

482
00:27:21.433 --> 00:27:24.436
(door bells jangle)

483
00:27:49.252 --> 00:27:51.963
(eerie music)

484
00:28:14.277 --> 00:28:16.029
Good evening.

485
00:28:16.071 --> 00:28:17.113
How can I help you?

486
00:28:17.947 --> 00:28:19.616
(Lilith gasps)

487
00:28:19.657 --> 00:28:22.243
My goodness. you're hurt!

488
00:28:24.454 --> 00:28:25.288
What happened?

489
00:28:31.044 --> 00:28:34.339
- This group of
guys attacked me.

490
00:28:35.298 --> 00:28:39.386
and then I woke up

491
00:28:40.428 --> 00:28:42.263
and I was alone.

492
00:28:43.264 --> 00:28:45.350
- These men that
did this to you.

493
00:28:47.268 --> 00:28:50.271
what would you like
to see done to them?

494
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.234
I don't know.

495
00:28:54.275 --> 00:28:56.444
I guess I should call the cops.

496
00:28:56.486 --> 00:28:58.071
Oh. you can.

497
00:28:58.113 --> 00:29:00.907
But what's to stop them from
doing this to another girl?

498
00:29:00.949 --> 00:29:02.742
How long would they be locked up

499
00:29:02.784 --> 00:29:04.953
before they were
back on the streets?

500
00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:09.874
- I guess I hadn't
thought of that.

501
00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:11.501
- And that's if
they believe you.

502
00:29:13.586 --> 00:29:15.213
These men have money.

503
00:29:15.255 --> 00:29:17.966
maybe strings that can
be pulled in the town

504
00:29:18.008 --> 00:29:19.342
to get them out of trouble.

505
00:29:21.845 --> 00:29:22.887
And you.

506
00:29:25.098 --> 00:29:28.893
Well. you have a past.

507
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.479
It's written all over you.

508
00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.027
What if you could stop
these men for good.

509
00:29:38.236 --> 00:29:41.448
teach them that they can't
just get away with everything?

510
00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:45.910
In a perfect world.

511
00:29:45.952 --> 00:29:48.163
It is a perfect world.

512
00:29:48.204 --> 00:29:49.914
There are other
ways to make sure

513
00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:51.958
someone gets what they deserve.

514
00:29:54.753 --> 00:29:56.379
How would I do that?

515
00:30:00.633 --> 00:30:01.593
Come sit and rest.

516
00:30:06.431 --> 00:30:07.974
(strikes match)

517
00:30:08.016 --> 00:30:10.435
Have you ever used a
spirit board before?

518
00:30:12.187 --> 00:30:14.147
There are pathways in this world

519
00:30:14.189 --> 00:30:16.483
far beyond your imagination.

520
00:30:18.193 --> 00:30:20.487
It's just a game. right?

521
00:30:20.528 --> 00:30:21.905
(Lilith laughs)

522
00:30:21.946 --> 00:30:24.366
I can assure you it's no game.

523
00:30:25.658 --> 00:30:29.037
Have you ever lost someone
you wish you could have had

524
00:30:29.079 --> 00:30:31.122
a few more moments with.

525
00:30:31.164 --> 00:30:33.458
wish you could speak
to one last time.

526
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.418
a family member perhaps?

527
00:30:37.545 --> 00:30:38.338
I guess.

528
00:30:39.673 --> 00:30:42.592
We all have someone we wish
we could talk to again.

529
00:30:45.637 --> 00:30:49.641
- Some of the boards
even provide a pathway

530
00:30:49.683 --> 00:30:52.018
to righting what's wrong.

531
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:56.439
Karma exists. and
so does vengeance.

532
00:30:56.481 --> 00:30:59.109
(eerie music)

533
00:31:00.735 --> 00:31:03.196
- Look. I appreciate
you helping me out.

534
00:31:03.238 --> 00:31:07.200
but it's getting late.
and I just wanna go home.

535
00:31:07.242 --> 00:31:08.535
Oh. suit yourself.

536
00:31:08.576 --> 00:31:12.455
I certainly hope you
get home safe this time.

537
00:31:12.497 --> 00:31:15.208
(tense music)

538
00:31:24.592 --> 00:31:27.012
What do we have to do?

539
00:31:27.053 --> 00:31:30.974
- This board belonged to
a very powerful witch.

540
00:31:31.016 --> 00:31:34.602
one who was murdered for
crimes she didn't commit.

541
00:31:36.229 --> 00:31:39.691
Her sorrow and pain loom heavy.

542
00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:44.279
But she requires a sacrifice.

543
00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:47.449
What kind of sacrifice?

544
00:31:48.616 --> 00:31:49.826
Your blood.

545
00:31:49.868 --> 00:31:51.870
(Sarah gasps)

(Sarah screams)

547
00:31:54.914 --> 00:31:56.332
What the hell?

548
00:31:56.374 --> 00:31:57.375
Sit.

549
00:31:58.209 --> 00:32:00.754
Sarah. I said sit.

550
00:32:00.795 --> 00:32:03.423
(eerie music)

551
00:32:08.428 --> 00:32:11.389
You'll have to repeat
after me. understand?

552
00:32:12.932 --> 00:32:13.975
Yes.

553
00:32:16.144 --> 00:32:20.398
- I summon the spirit
attached to this board.

554
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.277
- I summon the spirit
attached to this board.

555
00:32:24.319 --> 00:32:27.280
- A woman wronged.
a woman betrayed.

556
00:32:27.322 --> 00:32:30.283
a woman with vengeance
in her heart.

557
00:32:30.325 --> 00:32:33.953
- A woman wronged.
a woman betrayed.

558
00:32:33.995 --> 00:32:36.539
a woman with vengeance
in her heart.

559
00:32:39.125 --> 00:32:40.627
Talk to her. Sarah.

560
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:43.546
Ask her if she's here.
Tell her what you want.

561
00:32:45.674 --> 00:32:46.675
Hello. spirit.

562
00:32:46.716 --> 00:32:48.385
(table shaking)

563
00:32:48.426 --> 00:32:50.220
Are you here with us right now?

(planchette slides)

565
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.310

(Lilith laughs)

575
00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:23.545
Is this Mary Blackwood?

576
00:33:23.586 --> 00:33:25.171
(table shaking)

577
00:33:25.213 --> 00:33:26.631

(eerie music)

579
00:33:28.216 --> 00:33:31.094
- Keep on going. Sarah.
You can't go back now.

580
00:33:32.512 --> 00:33:36.141
- I want the men who
attacked me tonight

581
00:33:36.182 --> 00:33:38.393
to know the pain that I felt.

582
00:33:39.352 --> 00:33:44.065
to feel frightened.
hopeless. vulnerable.

583
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.777
Can you help me.

584
00:33:49.779 --> 00:33:52.741
(suspenseful music)

585
00:33:53.908 --> 00:33:57.078

586
00:33:58.371 --> 00:33:59.622

00:33:59.664 --> 00:34:02.500
(nails scratching)

588
00:34:05.587 --> 00:34:08.256
(Sarah gasps)

589
00:34:09.215 --> 00:34:11.092
Run along. Sarah.

590
00:34:11.134 --> 00:34:13.428
The door has
already been opened.

591
00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.599
(suspenseful music)

592
00:34:24.731 --> 00:34:27.692
(door bells jangle)

593
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.122

594
00:35:18.034 --> 00:35:20.662

(lock sliding)

596
00:35:33.675 --> 00:35:36.428
(heels tapping)

597
00:35:49.357 --> 00:35:52.652
(Sarah's voice shaking)

598
00:35:54.154 --> 00:35:56.698

- Hey. beautiful.
You need some help?

602
00:36:45.955 --> 00:36:47.540
Yes.

603
00:36:47.582 --> 00:36:48.667
I would love your help.

604
00:36:49.584 --> 00:36:52.879
(bathtub running)

605
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:55.382
(tense music)

606
00:36:55.423 --> 00:36:57.926
So what do you have in mind?

607
00:37:01.429 --> 00:37:03.890
(water bubbling)

608
00:37:03.932 --> 00:37:06.601
(tense music)

609
00:37:08.937 --> 00:37:11.731
(hard rock music)

610
00:37:13.066 --> 00:37:18.446
(body slams into windshield)
(tires squealing)

611
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.784
(driver breathing heavily)

612
00:37:24.994 --> 00:37:27.622
(tires skid)

613
00:37:33.294 --> 00:37:34.754
You killed him.

614
00:37:35.964 --> 00:37:37.132
What?

615
00:37:37.173 --> 00:37:38.925
You ran away.

616
00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:41.136
(water bubbling)

617
00:37:41.177 --> 00:37:43.304
No. it wasn't like that.

618
00:37:43.346 --> 00:37:45.932
You left him alone to die.

619
00:37:45.974 --> 00:37:47.726
No!

620
00:37:47.767 --> 00:37:48.768
No! Please!

621
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:49.644
Shh.

622
00:37:55.942 --> 00:37:57.736
Now go and find peace.

623
00:37:59.904 --> 00:38:02.323
(eerie music)

624
00:38:09.372 --> 00:38:10.582
(horn honking)

625
00:38:10.623 --> 00:38:15.795

(choking)
(blood gurgling)

00:38:26.806 --> 00:38:32.020
(water splashes)
(Sarah gasps)

629
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.565
(alarm clock beeping)

630
00:38:36.358 --> 00:38:39.027
(phone buzzing)

631
00:38:51.998 --> 00:38:54.376
(soft music)

632
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:06.638
(eerie music)

633
00:39:34.833 --> 00:39:36.876
[Mary Blackwood] Sarah.

634
00:39:39.087 --> 00:39:41.923
(ghostly whispering)

635
00:39:51.433 --> 00:39:53.977
(low music)

636
00:40:02.444 --> 00:40:04.863
(Sarah yawns)

637
00:40:04.904 --> 00:40:06.990
- You can catch flies
with that thing.

638
00:40:08.783 --> 00:40:11.077
- Sorry. Didn't get
much sleep last night.

639
00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:13.079
- How'd the rest
of your night go?

640
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:14.122
It was fine.

641
00:40:14.164 --> 00:40:15.874
Went home. took a bath.

642
00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:19.252
Liz. you've known
my mom for a while.

643
00:40:19.294 --> 00:40:20.628
Yeah.

644
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.839
Yeah. since I was a kid.
She used to babysit me.

645
00:40:24.674 --> 00:40:27.510
- You know about
what happened to her?

646
00:40:29.054 --> 00:40:32.098
- I know what people have
said happened to her.

647
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.518
- Did she ever talk to you
about that night at Laura's?

648
00:40:36.478 --> 00:40:37.854
No. sweetie.

649
00:40:37.896 --> 00:40:40.732
She didn't really talk to
anybody after that night.

650
00:40:47.822 --> 00:40:50.325
- Do you know anything
about Mary Blackwood?

651
00:40:50.367 --> 00:40:51.409
(tense music)

652
00:40:51.451 --> 00:40:52.786
Yeah.

653
00:40:52.827 --> 00:40:55.163
I mean. I know what's
in the museums.

654
00:40:56.206 --> 00:40:57.832
Her husband was cheating on her.

655
00:40:57.874 --> 00:41:01.878
and when she found out. he
accused her of being a witch.

656
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.171
She was hanged on
that large tree

657
00:41:03.213 --> 00:41:05.965
that's still in the
street. and then burned.

658
00:41:07.217 --> 00:41:10.011
Her husband then married
his mistress a month later.

659
00:41:10.637 --> 00:41:12.806
You know. the worst part of it

660
00:41:12.847 --> 00:41:15.100
is that she had three daughters.

661
00:41:16.017 --> 00:41:18.103
forced to grow up
without their mother.

662
00:41:21.231 --> 00:41:23.650
- Do you believe the
stories about her?

663
00:41:24.859 --> 00:41:27.946
- I mean. it depends on what
stories you're talking about.

664
00:41:28.863 --> 00:41:31.449
Do I think that she
practiced witchcraft?

665
00:41:31.491 --> 00:41:32.826
Maybe.

666
00:41:32.867 --> 00:41:35.078
They said that she
had this spirit board

667
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.790
she used to communicate with
the energies of the earth.

668
00:41:38.832 --> 00:41:41.543
But do I think that she's gonna
come back every couple years

669
00:41:41.584 --> 00:41:43.628
to seek revenge on this town?

670
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:44.587
I don't know.

671
00:41:46.006 --> 00:41:50.260
Look. I knew your mother
very well before that night.

672
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:54.931
And after that night. she was
a completely different person.

673
00:41:54.973 --> 00:41:59.060
She saw something
that messed her up.

674
00:42:02.147 --> 00:42:04.941
- Her therapist thinks
it was all in her head.

675
00:42:04.983 --> 00:42:06.776
that Tim and Laura
killed themselves

676
00:42:06.818 --> 00:42:08.820
after a fight about him cheating

677
00:42:08.862 --> 00:42:11.740
and mom went into
shock finding them.

678
00:42:13.491 --> 00:42:14.826
Hm.

679
00:42:14.868 --> 00:42:19.039
That's certainly a less
complicated explanation.

680
00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:20.707
Sure.

681
00:42:20.749 --> 00:42:23.209
But if you talk to some
people in this town.

682
00:42:23.877 --> 00:42:26.212
they'll tell you
that Mary Blackwood

683
00:42:26.254 --> 00:42:30.592
has some kind of secret.
underground cult of witches

684
00:42:30.633 --> 00:42:32.594
that still worship her.

685
00:42:32.635 --> 00:42:36.389
helping her haunt this
town for eternity.

686
00:42:36.431 --> 00:42:38.516
Boo!
(Sarah gasps)

687
00:42:38.558 --> 00:42:40.518
(Liz laughs)

688
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.895
Should see your face.

689
00:42:41.936 --> 00:42:43.271
I'm gonna go check stock.

690
00:42:43.313 --> 00:42:44.606
[Liz] Okay.

691
00:42:48.234 --> 00:42:51.154
(Liz sighs)

692
00:42:51.196 --> 00:42:53.948
(gloomy music)

693
00:43:06.961 --> 00:43:07.754
Sarah?

694
00:43:09.089 --> 00:43:09.923
Hey. Sarah!

695
00:43:38.326 --> 00:43:41.079
(eerie music)

696
00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:43.331
[Mary Blackwood] Derek.

697
00:43:49.254 --> 00:43:50.463
Jesus!

698
00:43:50.505 --> 00:43:52.298
Sorry. man.

699
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.341
Did you follow me here?

700
00:43:54.634 --> 00:43:56.845
- You weren't answering
my calls or texts.

701
00:43:58.054 --> 00:44:01.266
- Yeah. for a reason.
Goodbye. Asher.

702
00:44:02.225 --> 00:44:04.853
- So I'll see you
home later on tonight.

703
00:44:06.688 --> 00:44:07.689
I'm not coming back.

704
00:44:08.523 --> 00:44:09.816
I got a new place to crash

705
00:44:09.858 --> 00:44:11.693
until I find something
more permanent.

706
00:44:14.529 --> 00:44:15.655
Please. just...

707
00:44:15.697 --> 00:44:16.823
Just talk to me. Derek!

708
00:44:16.865 --> 00:44:18.825
I mean. you're my best friend.

709
00:44:19.784 --> 00:44:22.454
We're not friends. Asher.

710
00:44:22.495 --> 00:44:24.122
We haven't been for a while.

711
00:44:25.123 --> 00:44:27.375
We're just two people
that grew up together.

712
00:44:28.043 --> 00:44:29.669
- Look. I told
them not to do it.

713
00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:31.171
I tried to get 'em to stop.

714
00:44:31.212 --> 00:44:32.380
You could have killed her.

715
00:44:32.422 --> 00:44:35.175
But we didn't! She's fine!

716
00:44:35.884 --> 00:44:37.093
How do you know that?

717
00:44:37.135 --> 00:44:38.887
- I went to the
bar earlier today.

718
00:44:38.928 --> 00:44:41.973
looked in the window.
and she was fine.

719
00:44:42.015 --> 00:44:44.059
so no harm. no foul.

720
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:47.395
- If that helps you
sleep better at night.

721
00:44:49.814 --> 00:44:51.900
- You know I just want
them to accept me.

722
00:44:52.984 --> 00:44:54.361
like I was one of
the other guys.

723
00:44:55.737 --> 00:44:59.366
- Why. Asher? Who
the fuck cares?

724
00:45:00.116 --> 00:45:01.618
Be you.

725
00:45:01.659 --> 00:45:05.246
Because whoever you're trying
to be. I don't like it. man.

726
00:45:05.288 --> 00:45:08.291
I was always your
friend. no matter what.

727
00:45:09.918 --> 00:45:10.877
Please. Derek.

728
00:45:10.919 --> 00:45:12.253
Hey. I'm so sorry.

729
00:45:13.546 --> 00:45:15.382
You gotta forgive me. man.

730
00:45:15.423 --> 00:45:18.218
- Try forgiveness
with someone else.

731
00:45:18.259 --> 00:45:19.719
I'm done.

732
00:45:19.761 --> 00:45:20.762
Hey.

733
00:45:22.847 --> 00:45:23.723
Derek.

734
00:45:23.765 --> 00:45:26.309
(somber music)

735
00:45:39.114 --> 00:45:44.369
- So is that wedding
ring attached for good.

736
00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:49.082
or does it come off
for special occasions?

737
00:45:49.124 --> 00:45:50.834
- Well. I guess that
depends on who's asking.

738
00:45:50.875 --> 00:45:53.545
(Louise laughs)

739
00:45:55.755 --> 00:45:58.299
Derek! (gasps)

740
00:45:59.259 --> 00:46:00.135
Hi!

741
00:46:00.176 --> 00:46:02.512
How are you tonight. hot stuff.

742
00:46:02.554 --> 00:46:03.596
Hi. Louise. Thanks.

743
00:46:03.638 --> 00:46:04.597
(Louis sniffs)

744
00:46:04.639 --> 00:46:06.141
Oh my God. you smell so good.

745
00:46:06.182 --> 00:46:07.934
Are you wearing Prada?

746
00:46:07.976 --> 00:46:09.728
I'm not wearing anything.

747
00:46:09.769 --> 00:46:10.979
(Laura giggles)

748
00:46:11.021 --> 00:46:13.314
- So it must be
your natural musk.

749
00:46:13.356 --> 00:46:14.733
Yum.

750
00:46:14.774 --> 00:46:17.110
Hey. you should buy me a drink.

751
00:46:17.152 --> 00:46:18.903
Maybe later. Louise.

752
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:25.535
Listen. can we talk
about last night?

753
00:46:25.577 --> 00:46:26.411
I'm working.

754
00:46:28.121 --> 00:46:29.956
- I'll wait till
you're done then.

755
00:46:29.998 --> 00:46:30.999
Whatever.

756
00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:32.584
Hi.

757
00:46:32.625 --> 00:46:33.835
[Patron] Hm.

758
00:46:35.837 --> 00:46:36.838
Another round?

759
00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:40.592
You better make it a double.

760
00:46:41.885 --> 00:46:43.928
You all need to find Jesus.

761
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:44.804
(organ playing)

762
00:46:44.846 --> 00:46:47.390
(doors open)

763
00:47:32.811 --> 00:47:35.397
(doors open)

764
00:47:45.532 --> 00:47:46.324
Hello?

765
00:47:55.792 --> 00:47:58.461
(ominous music)

766
00:48:00.922 --> 00:48:03.133
[Mary Blackwood] Asher.

767
00:48:05.593 --> 00:48:06.428
Asher.

768
00:48:09.597 --> 00:48:10.432
Asher.

769
00:48:13.351 --> 00:48:14.185
Asher.

770
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.604
Jesus!

771
00:48:16.646 --> 00:48:17.814
Not quite.

772
00:48:17.856 --> 00:48:21.026
(suspenseful music)

773
00:48:26.364 --> 00:48:30.160
- Yeah. I think she could
use a drink. (laughing)

774
00:48:30.201 --> 00:48:31.536
Stupid bitch.

775
00:48:33.538 --> 00:48:35.457
(Asher gasps)

776
00:48:35.498 --> 00:48:36.499
Help.

777
00:48:36.541 --> 00:48:37.542
Someone.

778
00:48:37.584 --> 00:48:39.002
Please help me.

779
00:48:40.295 --> 00:48:42.255
Are you frightened?

780
00:48:44.758 --> 00:48:45.717
I'm sorry.

781
00:48:46.593 --> 00:48:48.470
I'm so sorry.

782
00:48:48.511 --> 00:48:51.181
(Asher panting)

783
00:48:52.557 --> 00:48:54.476
(Mary laughing)

784
00:48:54.517 --> 00:48:57.645
(laughter echoing)

785
00:49:00.648 --> 00:49:01.649
Asher.

786
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:08.490
(overlapping cackling)

787
00:49:16.122 --> 00:49:16.873
(Asher grunts)

788
00:49:16.915 --> 00:49:18.625
(Mary giggling)

789
00:49:18.667 --> 00:49:19.501
(knife slicing)

790
00:49:19.542 --> 00:49:22.128
(Asher shouts)

791
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.174
(tray and bottles clatter)

792
00:49:26.216 --> 00:49:27.550
Hey. you okay?

793
00:49:28.843 --> 00:49:29.636
Sit down.

794
00:49:33.723 --> 00:49:36.559
(Asher gasping)

795
00:49:36.601 --> 00:49:37.310
(blood dripping)

796
00:49:37.352 --> 00:49:40.689
(church bell tolling)

797
00:49:47.362 --> 00:49:49.322
(suspenseful music)

798
00:49:49.364 --> 00:49:54.536
(knife slicing)
(Asher screams)

799
00:49:56.538 --> 00:49:59.165
(wolf howls)

800
00:50:02.669 --> 00:50:05.630
(church bell tolling)

801
00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:12.429
(tolling distorts)

802
00:50:14.973 --> 00:50:17.600
(Asher gasping)

803
00:50:21.229 --> 00:50:23.773
Please. God. I don't wanna die.

804
00:50:25.066 --> 00:50:26.735
God?

805
00:50:26.776 --> 00:50:28.069
No.

806
00:50:28.111 --> 00:50:29.154
No God.

807
00:50:30.238 --> 00:50:31.614
And no heaven.

808
00:50:33.074 --> 00:50:34.617
There's only rot!

809
00:50:40.749 --> 00:50:41.583
[Liz] Sarah?

810
00:50:42.584 --> 00:50:43.710
Are you okay?

811
00:50:43.752 --> 00:50:46.379
- Seriously. I'm fine.
I just got dizzy.

812
00:50:46.421 --> 00:50:48.631
You shouldn't be on your feet.

813
00:50:48.673 --> 00:50:49.799
I'm okay.

814
00:50:49.841 --> 00:50:51.718
Sarah. it's a slow night.

815
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.304
You could take the rest
of it off if you want.

816
00:50:55.764 --> 00:50:56.556
Are you sure?

817
00:50:56.598 --> 00:50:57.640
Of course.

818
00:50:57.682 --> 00:50:59.225
Go home. get some rest.

819
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:02.729
Maybe you're right.

820
00:51:02.771 --> 00:51:04.606
Come on. I can walk you home.

821
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:10.653
(tense music)

822
00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:24.668
Look. are you sure you don't
need a doctor or something?

823
00:51:24.709 --> 00:51:26.628
- Why would I need
a doctor. Derek.

824
00:51:29.005 --> 00:51:29.798
Sarah...

825
00:51:30.924 --> 00:51:32.801
You were right about them.

826
00:51:32.842 --> 00:51:35.637
I don't need them as
friends. any of them.

827
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:40.892
Whatever you need. I'll do it.

828
00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:44.145
If you want me to go to the
cops. I'll tell them everything.

829
00:51:44.187 --> 00:51:45.563
No. No cops.

830
00:51:45.605 --> 00:51:47.774
I don't want anything
like that involved.

831
00:51:50.402 --> 00:51:51.736
What do you want me to do?

832
00:51:51.778 --> 00:51:52.821
Stay away from them.

833
00:51:53.738 --> 00:51:54.864
Keep yourself safe.

834
00:51:56.324 --> 00:51:57.575
And what about you?

835
00:51:57.617 --> 00:51:59.411
I can take care of myself.

836
00:52:00.912 --> 00:52:02.664
Look. I know you can.

837
00:52:05.709 --> 00:52:07.794
I like a girl who can
take care of yourself.

838
00:52:09.337 --> 00:52:12.132
- Well then I've got
the perfect one for you.

839
00:52:12.173 --> 00:52:13.675
Yeah?

840
00:52:13.717 --> 00:52:14.676
Who's that?

841
00:52:17.178 --> 00:52:19.848
(Louise peeing)

842
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:24.686
I really didn't
need to see that.

843
00:52:24.728 --> 00:52:26.896
- I bet she Frenches
on the first date.

844
00:52:27.856 --> 00:52:29.816
- Still haven't forgot
about that have you?

845
00:52:29.858 --> 00:52:30.692
Not a chance.

846
00:52:32.027 --> 00:52:34.029
(mysterious music)

847
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:35.363
She looks all right.

848
00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:39.951
I tell ya. man. last
night I thought she was-

849
00:52:39.993 --> 00:52:42.746
Yeah. I know. Caleb.

850
00:52:42.787 --> 00:52:45.498
(tense music)

851
00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.375
- You think she's
gonna go to the cops?

852
00:52:48.335 --> 00:52:50.003
I don't know.

853
00:52:50.045 --> 00:52:53.340
I feel like if she was. she
would've done it already.

854
00:52:53.381 --> 00:52:55.508
Still. though. we
need to make sure.

855
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:59.971
What you mean. "make sure"?

856
00:53:00.013 --> 00:53:01.389
I'm gonna follow her.

857
00:53:02.307 --> 00:53:03.808
put a little fright
in her. you know?

858
00:53:04.893 --> 00:53:05.769
No. Nah. man. fuck that.

859
00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:06.936
No. Count me out. dude.

860
00:53:06.978 --> 00:53:08.021
Excuse me?

861
00:53:08.063 --> 00:53:09.689
No. Isaac. I'm serious. man.

862
00:53:09.731 --> 00:53:11.816
Look. I'm getting tired
of this shit. all right?

863
00:53:11.858 --> 00:53:13.902
I've got too much good
going in my life right now

864
00:53:13.943 --> 00:53:15.570
just to fuck it up for your ego.

865
00:53:15.612 --> 00:53:17.072
Hey. she insulted all of us!

866
00:53:17.113 --> 00:53:20.200
You damn right she did.
and we kind of deserved it!

867
00:53:20.241 --> 00:53:22.035
What the fuck you
got to prove. man?

868
00:53:22.077 --> 00:53:23.370
Huh?

869
00:53:23.411 --> 00:53:25.372
We're not in high
school anymore.

870
00:53:25.413 --> 00:53:27.874
Life has stakes now.
fuckin' consequences.

871
00:53:29.834 --> 00:53:31.503
Damn it.

872
00:53:31.544 --> 00:53:33.880
No. you're right.

873
00:53:33.922 --> 00:53:35.465
You're right. it does.

874
00:53:36.424 --> 00:53:38.843
Let's not do anything.
Let's just go home.

875
00:53:38.885 --> 00:53:40.303
All right? We'll wait.

876
00:53:40.345 --> 00:53:42.430
Wait for her to tell somebody.

877
00:53:42.472 --> 00:53:43.848
Then what's gonna happen. huh?

878
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:45.183
What do you think?

879
00:53:45.225 --> 00:53:46.559
You remember how every night

880
00:53:46.601 --> 00:53:47.852
your dad used to beat
this shit outta you.

881
00:53:47.894 --> 00:53:49.729
and I was the one.
hey. listen to me.

882
00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:53.108
I was the one who snuck you
into my house to protect you.

883
00:53:53.149 --> 00:53:55.026
That's what we're doing? Okay.

884
00:53:55.068 --> 00:53:56.611
You were there for
me. You protected me.

885
00:53:56.653 --> 00:53:58.988
I remember that. Yes. I get it.

886
00:54:00.073 --> 00:54:02.200
- Who's gonna protect your
when I'm behind bars. huh?

887
00:54:02.242 --> 00:54:04.869
(tense music)

888
00:54:07.706 --> 00:54:11.001
- Look. man. just leave
the girl alone. all right?

889
00:54:12.085 --> 00:54:13.753
The shit's over with. man.

890
00:54:13.795 --> 00:54:16.172
We should have never fucked
with her to begin with.

891
00:54:16.214 --> 00:54:17.090
You kidding me?

892
00:54:18.258 --> 00:54:20.385
What. you just wanna
walk away now. huh?

893
00:54:20.427 --> 00:54:22.637
No. no. we're already in this.

894
00:54:23.596 --> 00:54:26.057
Hey. look. if I get one
more charge against me.

895
00:54:26.099 --> 00:54:27.767
just one. it is over for me.

896
00:54:27.809 --> 00:54:29.936
and it'll sure as shit
be over for you too.

897
00:54:29.978 --> 00:54:30.979
Fuck that.

898
00:54:31.021 --> 00:54:31.938
No. no. you look at me.

899
00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:37.902
I am not gonna let that
little bitch ruin our lives.

900
00:54:39.738 --> 00:54:40.613
Okay?

901
00:54:41.239 --> 00:54:42.032
Get your head in the game.

902
00:54:42.073 --> 00:54:44.909
(ominous music)

903
00:54:59.507 --> 00:55:00.300
(disturbing music)

904
00:55:00.342 --> 00:55:01.801
(Sarah gasps)

905
00:55:01.843 --> 00:55:04.054
(eerie music)

906
00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:33.875
Who are you?

907
00:56:19.754 --> 00:56:20.588
Asher.

908
00:57:11.556 --> 00:57:13.099
A woman wronged.

909
00:57:15.518 --> 00:57:17.145
A woman betrayed.

910
00:57:19.272 --> 00:57:21.066
A woman with vengeance

911
00:57:25.987 --> 00:57:27.489
in her heart.

912
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:30.200
(Sarah gasps)

913
00:57:31.659 --> 00:57:34.621
(witch snarling)

914
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.044
(witch cackling)

915
00:57:41.086 --> 00:57:43.755
(Sarah gasping)

916
00:57:45.256 --> 00:57:46.049
(Sarah gasps)

917
00:57:46.091 --> 00:57:49.094
(Sarah screams)

918
00:57:49.135 --> 00:57:51.763
(Sarah gasps)

919
00:57:53.181 --> 00:57:54.766
[Viola] Bad dream?

920
00:57:56.184 --> 00:57:57.686
Mom?

921
00:57:57.727 --> 00:58:01.481
- Sarah. when you
came back here.

922
00:58:01.523 --> 00:58:02.899
I thought that we
had an agreement

923
00:58:02.941 --> 00:58:05.193
that we were gonna be
honest with each other

924
00:58:05.235 --> 00:58:06.152
about everything.

925
00:58:07.862 --> 00:58:09.531
What are you talking about?

926
00:58:10.865 --> 00:58:13.243
- I just got off the phone
with your stepmother.

927
00:58:16.663 --> 00:58:18.331
I told you not to call her.

928
00:58:18.373 --> 00:58:19.207
I didn't.

929
00:58:20.291 --> 00:58:21.209
She called me.

930
00:58:22.585 --> 00:58:24.921
You had a letter
sent to her place

931
00:58:24.963 --> 00:58:26.756
about a court date next month?

932
00:58:26.798 --> 00:58:29.342
- That letter is
none of her business.

933
00:58:29.384 --> 00:58:30.927
No. but it's mine.

934
00:58:32.345 --> 00:58:36.599
Breaking and entering?
Destruction of private property?

935
00:58:37.892 --> 00:58:42.063
Sarah. were you using again?

936
00:58:42.105 --> 00:58:44.774
- God. mom. no! It
wasn't that dramatic.

937
00:58:44.816 --> 00:58:46.109
Dad and Lydia were fighting.

938
00:58:46.151 --> 00:58:48.695
and I just didn't
wanna be around it.

939
00:58:48.737 --> 00:58:52.115
I thought it was abandoned.
Turns out I was wrong.

940
00:58:52.157 --> 00:58:53.783
- Well. when were
you gonna tell me?

941
00:58:53.825 --> 00:58:56.244
I mean. what. you thought
I wouldn't find out?

942
00:58:56.286 --> 00:58:57.996
- Yeah. kind of.
That was the idea.

943
00:58:58.038 --> 00:58:59.914
I didn't want you to overreact.

944
00:59:01.041 --> 00:59:03.877
- And she told me
that... (sighs)

945
00:59:03.918 --> 00:59:06.087
you were stealing from her.

946
00:59:07.088 --> 00:59:09.299
- Gimme a break! That woman
leached off of dad for years.

947
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:12.218
I just borrowed a couple
bucks for the subway.

948
00:59:13.303 --> 00:59:15.889
- Oh my God. Sarah.
(cries softly)

949
00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:17.223
What happened to you?

950
00:59:18.266 --> 00:59:20.101
You were my little girl.

951
00:59:21.936 --> 00:59:23.063
Come off it. mom.

952
00:59:23.104 --> 00:59:24.564
You were never
there as a parent.

953
00:59:24.606 --> 00:59:26.191
and I was never
your little girl.

954
00:59:26.232 --> 00:59:29.319
You were always too obsessed
with her to even notice me.

955
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:30.653
(tense music)

956
00:59:30.695 --> 00:59:31.738
With who?

957
00:59:33.531 --> 00:59:34.491
Mary Blackwood.

958
00:59:34.532 --> 00:59:35.283
(ominous music)

959
00:59:35.325 --> 00:59:36.284
Stop it.

960
00:59:36.326 --> 00:59:37.118
Don't say-

961
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:38.453
Why?

962
00:59:38.495 --> 00:59:40.455
Why were you so afraid that
she'd come back for you?

963
00:59:40.497 --> 00:59:44.334
Do you know how to stop her?
Is there a way to stop her?

964
00:59:44.376 --> 00:59:46.544
Mary Blackwood is dead.

965
00:59:46.586 --> 00:59:48.254
She's been dead for centuries.

966
00:59:48.296 --> 00:59:49.798
I know she's not real now.

967
00:59:51.424 --> 00:59:53.176
Tim and Laura killed themselves.

968
00:59:54.886 --> 00:59:56.304
I know I should have
listened to your father

969
00:59:56.346 --> 00:59:58.139
and gotten therapy.
and I'm sorry

970
00:59:58.181 --> 01:00:00.350
if this affected the way
I've raised you for so long.

971
01:00:00.392 --> 01:00:03.728
but that's over now.

972
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:05.188
She's not coming back.

973
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:08.441
(ominous music)

974
01:00:08.483 --> 01:00:10.151
But what if she did?

975
01:00:11.152 --> 01:00:14.322
What if she did come
back. but not for you?

976
01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:19.369
- [Viola] What do
you mean by that?

977
01:00:19.411 --> 01:00:21.287
I have to go.

978
01:00:21.329 --> 01:00:22.622
Sarah. wait a minute!

979
01:00:22.664 --> 01:00:24.791
Sarah. please tell
me you're not saying

980
01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:27.669
what I think you're
saying. (breathing heavily)

981
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:29.504
- I'm sorry I
never believed you.

982
01:00:29.546 --> 01:00:32.132
I don't wanna drag you
back into this again!

983
01:00:36.553 --> 01:00:37.512
Derek?

984
01:00:37.554 --> 01:00:38.388
What the hell?

985
01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:41.057
What's wrong?

986
01:00:43.226 --> 01:00:45.186
- I didn't know
where else to go.

987
01:00:46.354 --> 01:00:47.272
What happened?

988
01:00:49.399 --> 01:00:50.400
It's Asher.

989
01:00:51.359 --> 01:00:52.193
He's dead.

990
01:00:54.279 --> 01:00:56.322
What?

991
01:00:56.364 --> 01:00:57.782
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have come here.

992
01:00:57.824 --> 01:00:58.992
- not after what they did.
- No. Derek. wait!

993
01:00:59.034 --> 01:01:00.243
What happened to him?

994
01:01:01.661 --> 01:01:03.204
They think it was a suicide.

995
01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:07.459
I saw Asher.

996
01:01:08.501 --> 01:01:10.086
I saw him in my dream.

997
01:01:10.712 --> 01:01:12.380
What are you talking about?

998
01:01:13.882 --> 01:01:16.301
- Derek. I don't think
he killed himself.

999
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.433
(slams shot glass)

1000
01:01:23.475 --> 01:01:24.267
(smacks bar top)

1001
01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:25.352
Another!

1002
01:01:29.397 --> 01:01:31.900
- Do you really think that's
a good idea right now?

1003
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:35.111
My little brother is dead.

1004
01:01:35.153 --> 01:01:38.239
You have a better idea of what
I should be doing right now?

1005
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:44.996
(pours shot)

1006
01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:47.874
Hey.

1007
01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:48.875
Take it easy.

1008
01:01:53.254 --> 01:01:54.381
(soft music)

1009
01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:57.092
- When I woke up. I
thought it was a dream.

1010
01:01:57.133 --> 01:02:01.429
It felt so real.
but it couldn't be.

1011
01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:05.141
- You think that you conjured
the spirit of Mary Blackwood

1012
01:02:05.183 --> 01:02:06.309
and now she's trying
to kill everyone

1013
01:02:06.351 --> 01:02:07.519
that attacked you that night?

1014
01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.937
Look. I know I sound crazy.

1015
01:02:08.978 --> 01:02:12.357
I know I sound like my mother.

1016
01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:13.566
No.

1017
01:02:13.608 --> 01:02:18.154
- But the dream I had
last night was so real.

1018
01:02:18.196 --> 01:02:23.368
And if I'm right.
you're in danger too.

1019
01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:26.079
(tense music)

1020
01:02:26.121 --> 01:02:27.789
Why would you say that?

1021
01:02:32.043 --> 01:02:35.296
- I saw you last
night in my dream.

1022
01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:38.842
Dead.

1023
01:02:40.593 --> 01:02:42.137
You were hanging from a noose.

1024
01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:46.850
You don't believe me. do you?

1025
01:02:46.891 --> 01:02:47.851
No. no.

1026
01:02:49.477 --> 01:02:50.311
I do.

1027
01:02:52.731 --> 01:02:53.481
Really?

1028
01:02:54.607 --> 01:02:55.400
Yeah.

1029
01:02:56.943 --> 01:03:02.198
I had the same dream of being
hanged. and it felt so real.

1030
01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:07.495
I woke up and I
was still in pain.

1031
01:03:07.537 --> 01:03:10.040
and I looked in the
mirror and I saw this.

1032
01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:11.124
(eerie music)

1033
01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:12.375
[Sarah] Oh my God.

1034
01:03:12.417 --> 01:03:13.335
It still burns.

1035
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:17.505
We have to stop her. then.

1036
01:03:17.547 --> 01:03:19.341
before she can kill anyone else.

1037
01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:21.634
How do we do that?

1038
01:03:21.676 --> 01:03:24.596
- I wanna go back to that
shop where I met that woman.

1039
01:03:24.637 --> 01:03:25.972
She told me the door was open.

1040
01:03:26.014 --> 01:03:27.599
Maybe she knows how to close it.

1041
01:03:29.517 --> 01:03:30.560
Okay.

1042
01:03:31.519 --> 01:03:34.189
(anxious music)

1043
01:03:38.026 --> 01:03:38.818
Come on!

1044
01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.779
(door rattling)

1045
01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.113
Damn it!

1046
01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:44.199
- Are you sure this
is the right shop?

1047
01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.533
I mean. the place you described

1048
01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:47.494
is kind of dime a
dozen in this town.

1049
01:03:47.535 --> 01:03:48.912
It was here. I swear!

1050
01:03:48.953 --> 01:03:50.121
She took me into the back room

1051
01:03:50.163 --> 01:03:52.248
and made me touch the board.

1052
01:03:52.290 --> 01:03:53.667
- Well. if we can't
find the board.

1053
01:03:53.708 --> 01:03:55.877
then we're gonna have to
come up with another plan.

1054
01:03:57.379 --> 01:03:59.339
- We have to warn
Isaac and Caleb.

1055
01:03:59.381 --> 01:04:02.384
She's gonna go after them just
like she went after Asher.

1056
01:04:04.469 --> 01:04:06.513
- I always thought
you were cute.

1057
01:04:06.554 --> 01:04:09.557
I loved watching you play
football on Friday nights

1058
01:04:09.599 --> 01:04:11.476
and tackling all the tight ends.

1059
01:04:11.518 --> 01:04:12.519
[Isaac] Is that so?

1060
01:04:13.269 --> 01:04:17.357
It is so. (giggles)

1061
01:04:17.399 --> 01:04:18.483
Hey. Caleb.

1062
01:04:18.525 --> 01:04:19.901
Caleb!

1063
01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:21.945
- Pull up a chair.
I'll buy a drink.

1064
01:04:21.986 --> 01:04:23.321
No. no. no. man.

1065
01:04:23.363 --> 01:04:24.572
Let's go on and get
you home. all right?

1066
01:04:24.614 --> 01:04:25.615
It's been a long day for you.

1067
01:04:25.657 --> 01:04:27.367
Oh. fuck that.

1068
01:04:27.409 --> 01:04:29.536
Me and Louise were just
getting reacquainted.

1069
01:04:29.577 --> 01:04:30.870
(Louise chuckles)

1070
01:04:30.912 --> 01:04:32.664
- Yeah? Well. say
goodnight. all right?

1071
01:04:32.706 --> 01:04:34.040
Come on. man. I'll call you cab.

1072
01:04:34.082 --> 01:04:37.210
- I'll call you a
cock sucker. (laughs)

1073
01:04:39.754 --> 01:04:41.423
She tell you to come get me?

1074
01:04:41.464 --> 01:04:42.549
- Come on. Isaac.
Don't start that.

1075
01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:44.259
No. fuck all of you!

1076
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.218
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey!

1077
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:46.594
Isaac. calm down. man.

1078
01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:50.390
Listen.

1079
01:04:50.432 --> 01:04:52.142
Asher was a good kid. all right?

1080
01:04:52.183 --> 01:04:53.518
We all know that.

1081
01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.145
But there was no way
you could have known

1082
01:04:55.186 --> 01:04:57.188
he would do something
like this. all right?

1083
01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:00.692
- You really believe
that suicide bullshit?

1084
01:05:01.568 --> 01:05:03.987
Yeah right.

1085
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:05.071
All right. Isaac.

1086
01:05:05.113 --> 01:05:06.698
So what else was it then. man?

1087
01:05:08.158 --> 01:05:09.659
I tell you what it was.

1088
01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:12.537
It was that bitch Sarah.

1089
01:05:12.579 --> 01:05:15.540
She's a nut just like
that mother of hers.

1090
01:05:16.416 --> 01:05:19.169
I'm telling you. she's after us.

1091
01:05:20.211 --> 01:05:21.421
What the fuck. man?

1092
01:05:21.463 --> 01:05:22.964
- What the fuck
is going on here?

1093
01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:24.257
Are you fucking
hearing yourself. man?

1094
01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:26.718
You know what? Go
on your own trip.

1095
01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.053
I'm through with this shit. man.

1096
01:05:28.094 --> 01:05:29.679
Through with you and
your fucking ego!

1097
01:05:31.806 --> 01:05:33.683
You know what? (chuckles)

1098
01:05:33.725 --> 01:05:35.435
I think I will get outta here.

1099
01:05:36.311 --> 01:05:37.604
I'm gonna find Sarah.

1100
01:05:38.521 --> 01:05:39.314
End this now.

1101
01:05:39.356 --> 01:05:40.357
Hey. Isaac. come on. man.

1102
01:05:40.398 --> 01:05:41.733
Hey!

1103
01:05:41.775 --> 01:05:43.151
Come on. man!

1104
01:05:44.819 --> 01:05:47.489
(eerie music)

1105
01:05:48.656 --> 01:05:50.367
I'll see you later.

1106
01:05:52.702 --> 01:05:53.620
Whatever.

1107
01:05:56.331 --> 01:05:58.625
I'm glad you're here.

1108
01:05:58.667 --> 01:06:01.336
(ominous music)

1109
01:06:03.672 --> 01:06:04.506
Caleb.

1110
01:06:07.717 --> 01:06:09.260
Do I know you?

1111
01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:11.513
Perhaps.

1112
01:06:22.774 --> 01:06:25.402
(relaxed music)

1113
01:06:44.045 --> 01:06:45.130
Show off.

1114
01:07:10.071 --> 01:07:12.741
(music slowing)

1115
01:07:15.994 --> 01:07:17.245
(Caleb laughing)

1116
01:07:17.287 --> 01:07:19.789
- Stomp that bitch.
Isaac. Yeah. (laughing)

1117
01:07:19.831 --> 01:07:20.707
Uh-huh.

1118
01:07:20.749 --> 01:07:22.042
You can't fuck with us!

1119
01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:25.211
(distorted speech)

1120
01:07:27.797 --> 01:07:28.923
What the fuck?

1121
01:07:28.965 --> 01:07:31.092
Do you feel hopeless?

1122
01:07:31.718 --> 01:07:33.136
(neck snaps)

1123
01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:36.681
(Louise screams)

1124
01:07:36.723 --> 01:07:38.725
(body thuds)

1125
01:07:38.767 --> 01:07:41.478
(door rattling)

1126
01:07:57.619 --> 01:07:58.745
Hey!

1127
01:07:58.787 --> 01:08:00.705
Hold it right there.
you psycho bitch!

1128
01:08:02.582 --> 01:08:05.460
No one kills my customers!

1129
01:08:05.502 --> 01:08:06.378
Why?

1130
01:08:07.837 --> 01:08:09.798
When he would leave you to
die if given the opportunity.

1131
01:08:11.841 --> 01:08:12.884
(Liz grunting)

1132
01:08:12.926 --> 01:08:14.260
What the fuck?

1133
01:08:14.302 --> 01:08:16.763
(baseball bat slams)

1134
01:08:16.805 --> 01:08:19.808
(Louise whimpers)

1135
01:08:22.811 --> 01:08:25.480
(tense music)

1136
01:08:26.856 --> 01:08:28.149
Stand.

1137
01:08:34.656 --> 01:08:38.535
Men have hurt and
taken advantage of you your entire life.

1138
01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:41.246
Do not numb the pain any longer.

1139
01:08:43.665 --> 01:08:45.458
Take back control of yourself.

1140
01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:58.388
(Louise breathing heavily)

1141
01:08:59.389 --> 01:09:02.267
(ominous music)

1142
01:09:06.855 --> 01:09:09.399
(Sarah gasps)

1143
01:09:09.441 --> 01:09:11.067
(disturbing music)

1144
01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:12.694
We're too late.

1145
01:09:19.951 --> 01:09:20.952
[Sarah] Liz!

1146
01:09:20.994 --> 01:09:21.786
(Liz groaning)

1147
01:09:21.828 --> 01:09:22.829
Sarah.

1148
01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:23.872
Hey.

1149
01:09:23.913 --> 01:09:24.914
Don't move.

1150
01:09:28.376 --> 01:09:29.878
What happened?

1151
01:09:29.919 --> 01:09:31.421
The stories.

1152
01:09:32.213 --> 01:09:32.964
They're true.

1153
01:09:33.923 --> 01:09:35.842
Viola was right.

1154
01:09:35.884 --> 01:09:37.844
Mary Blackwood is real.

1155
01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.765
She's one tough bitch.

1156
01:09:41.806 --> 01:09:43.058
Call her an ambulance.

1157
01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:46.144
- What are we gonna
do about the witch?

1158
01:09:46.186 --> 01:09:47.395
We're gonna get that board

1159
01:09:47.437 --> 01:09:48.980
and send that god
damn witch back

1160
01:09:49.022 --> 01:09:51.274
to whatever hell she came from.

1161
01:09:51.316 --> 01:09:52.484
How do we do that?

1162
01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:56.738
I have a pretty good idea.

1163
01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:01.951
(engine revving)
(hard rock music)

1164
01:10:06.956 --> 01:10:10.960
What the hell?

1165
01:10:11.002 --> 01:10:13.672
(ominous music)

1166
01:10:20.095 --> 01:10:21.429
Hey. it's you.

1167
01:10:27.018 --> 01:10:28.019
You lost?

1168
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:31.898
You need me to take you home?

1169
01:10:33.858 --> 01:10:34.818
I am home.

1170
01:10:42.075 --> 01:10:43.034
You sure you live here?

1171
01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.287
Come.

1172
01:10:56.089 --> 01:10:57.340
(eerie music)

1173
01:10:57.382 --> 01:11:02.595
Join me.

1174
01:11:03.221 --> 01:11:04.389
Don't have to tell me twice.

1175
01:11:09.811 --> 01:11:12.480
(ominous music)

1176
01:11:35.086 --> 01:11:38.340
You forget to pay
the heating bill?

1177
01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:43.470
This isn't your house. isn't it?

1178
01:11:45.221 --> 01:11:47.098
It shall be our house.

1179
01:11:49.059 --> 01:11:49.809
Together.

1180
01:11:59.819 --> 01:12:02.155
(ominous music)

1181
01:12:02.197 --> 01:12:03.615
(Isaac grunting)
(kick slams)

1182
01:12:03.656 --> 01:12:08.411
- You like that. you
fucking bitch? (laughing)

1183
01:12:31.601 --> 01:12:34.562
(flame whooshes)

1184
01:12:41.319 --> 01:12:44.406
(ominous music)

1185
01:13:00.505 --> 01:13:02.424
Where did you go?

1186
01:13:11.182 --> 01:13:12.142
All right.

1187
01:13:22.444 --> 01:13:24.154
You are so beautiful.

1188
01:13:29.117 --> 01:13:31.244
(door slams)

1189
01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:32.245
Disrobe.

1190
01:13:32.287 --> 01:13:33.121
Yes. ma'am.

1191
01:13:41.129 --> 01:13:42.255
(suspenseful music)

1192
01:13:42.297 --> 01:13:44.799
Okay. I can get into this.

1193
01:13:46.468 --> 01:13:50.138
(chatter on police radio)

1194
01:13:51.264 --> 01:13:52.474
Oh no!

1195
01:13:53.224 --> 01:13:54.059
No!

1196
01:13:55.143 --> 01:13:56.436
Sarah!

1197
01:13:56.478 --> 01:13:58.188
God. Oh my God. Liz!

1198
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:59.230
Oh my god.

1199
01:13:59.272 --> 01:14:00.482
Oh my God. she was here!

1200
01:14:00.523 --> 01:14:01.399
She was here. wasn't she?

1201
01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:02.650
Mary Blackwood.

1202
01:14:04.152 --> 01:14:05.403
Where's Sarah?

1203
01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:07.197
- She went to get
the Ouija board.

1204
01:14:07.238 --> 01:14:08.740
She's trying to stop her.

1205
01:14:09.366 --> 01:14:12.410
(Liz groans)

1206
01:14:12.452 --> 01:14:15.663
(suspenseful music)

1207
01:14:18.333 --> 01:14:20.877
(Mary moaning)

1208
01:14:39.354 --> 01:14:41.356
Are you vulnerable?

1209
01:14:41.398 --> 01:14:44.275
(ominous music)

1210
01:14:46.236 --> 01:14:47.195
What?

1211
01:14:47.237 --> 01:14:48.196
(disturbing music)

1212
01:14:48.238 --> 01:14:48.988
(Mary Blackwood cackling)

1213
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:50.156
(Isaac screams)

1214
01:14:50.198 --> 01:14:51.199
No! No!

1215
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.160
(Mary Blackwood cackling)

1216
01:14:54.202 --> 01:14:56.454
(Isaac screams)

1217
01:14:56.496 --> 01:14:58.581
Don't get soft now.

1218
01:15:09.217 --> 01:15:11.886
(dramatic music)

1219
01:15:30.071 --> 01:15:32.115
- What the hell is
Isaac doing here?

1220
01:15:34.409 --> 01:15:36.077
We might be too late for him.

1221
01:15:46.463 --> 01:15:47.839
Sarah. wait.

1222
01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.274
Isaac!

1223
01:16:09.319 --> 01:16:10.862
Are you in here?

1224
01:16:20.663 --> 01:16:23.083
(low thud)

1225
01:17:01.162 --> 01:17:03.415
(door creaks)

1226
01:17:06.501 --> 01:17:07.711
Oh. God.

1227
01:17:09.421 --> 01:17:10.672
Isaac.

1228
01:17:11.339 --> 01:17:12.173
Derek.

1229
01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:14.843
Let's just find the board.

1230
01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:17.429
- In my dream it
was in the attic.

1231
01:17:19.597 --> 01:17:22.684
(disturbing music)

1232
01:17:30.525 --> 01:17:33.695
(suspenseful music)

1233
01:17:59.429 --> 01:18:01.306
(Derek gasps)

1234
01:18:01.348 --> 01:18:02.098
What's wrong?

1235
01:18:02.807 --> 01:18:03.892
I'm fine.

1236
01:18:07.062 --> 01:18:08.480
No. you're not!

1237
01:18:08.521 --> 01:18:09.939
It's definitely in this room.

1238
01:18:17.197 --> 01:18:17.947
It's over here.

1239
01:18:29.626 --> 01:18:32.504
(light bulb hums)

1240
01:18:32.545 --> 01:18:34.381
She's close. We have to hurry.

1241
01:18:35.757 --> 01:18:38.510
(fire crackling)

1242
01:18:48.978 --> 01:18:50.397
You ready?

1243
01:18:50.438 --> 01:18:51.439
Not at all.

1244
01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.483
Let's do it.

1245
01:18:54.609 --> 01:18:57.320
(tense music)

1246
01:18:58.988 --> 01:19:00.407
(door slams)

1247
01:19:00.448 --> 01:19:02.033
Mom?

1248
01:19:02.075 --> 01:19:04.077
- What are you doing
in here. Sarah?

1249
01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:05.662
I have to stop her!

1250
01:19:05.704 --> 01:19:07.622
We can't be in here. baby.

1251
01:19:07.664 --> 01:19:09.124
I can't be in here.

1252
01:19:09.165 --> 01:19:12.293
- I have to send her back
before she comes for Derek!

1253
01:19:12.335 --> 01:19:14.379
- What do you mean
send her back?

1254
01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:17.090
What did you do. Sarah?

1255
01:19:17.132 --> 01:19:18.883
I brought back Mary Blackwood!

1256
01:19:18.925 --> 01:19:20.468
All these years. you were right!

1257
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:21.845
We should have believed you.

1258
01:19:21.886 --> 01:19:23.430
Well. real or not.

1259
01:19:23.471 --> 01:19:26.933
I should never have let her
control my life the way she did.

1260
01:19:27.934 --> 01:19:28.768
Then help me.

1261
01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:30.562
I don't know if I can.

1262
01:19:31.479 --> 01:19:34.065
- I opened the door. You
can help me close it.

1263
01:19:34.107 --> 01:19:35.900
That's not the way it works.

1264
01:19:35.942 --> 01:19:38.361
You don't think she's
gonna stop with Derek.

1265
01:19:38.403 --> 01:19:42.240
Once she does your
bidding. she comes for you.

1266
01:19:42.282 --> 01:19:44.826
You only close the
door when you die.

1267
01:19:45.869 --> 01:19:47.162
What?

1268
01:19:47.203 --> 01:19:49.080
- Yeah. that's what
happened to Laura.

1269
01:19:49.122 --> 01:19:51.541
- We can still talk to
her. bargain with her.

1270
01:19:51.583 --> 01:19:52.917
I need you to help me.

1271
01:19:52.959 --> 01:19:55.587
- You can't bargain
with Mary Blackwood.

1272
01:19:55.628 --> 01:19:57.047
She's pure evil.

1273
01:19:57.088 --> 01:20:00.467
Mom. please. We have to try.

1274
01:20:02.635 --> 01:20:03.595
You're right.

1275
01:20:05.889 --> 01:20:07.474
This ends tonight.

1276
01:20:09.351 --> 01:20:13.480
I summon the spirit
attached to this board.

1277
01:20:13.521 --> 01:20:18.193
a woman scorned.
a woman betrayed.

1278
01:20:18.234 --> 01:20:20.987
a woman with vengeance
in her heart.

1279
01:20:21.029 --> 01:20:22.364
Mary Blackwood.

1280
01:20:22.405 --> 01:20:25.658
my daughter brought you
back from the afterlife.

1281
01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:27.702
but she left the door open.

1282
01:20:28.453 --> 01:20:33.541
I command you to close
the door and leave!

1283
01:20:34.042 --> 01:20:35.627
(planchette slides)

1284
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:36.961
What do you want?

1285
01:20:38.588 --> 01:20:39.422
H.

1286
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:41.383
E.

1287
01:20:42.759 --> 01:20:43.551
R.

1288
01:20:45.303 --> 01:20:46.054
B.

1289
01:20:46.846 --> 01:20:47.639
L.

1290
01:20:49.724 --> 01:20:50.934
(disturbing music)

1291
01:20:50.975 --> 01:20:51.976
Her blood.

1292
01:20:52.018 --> 01:20:53.061
We should stop.

1293
01:20:53.103 --> 01:20:55.855
No. We have to keep going.

1294
01:20:55.897 --> 01:20:57.482
(loud bang)

1295
01:20:57.524 --> 01:21:00.110
Mary Blackwood. will you
take the blood of another?

1296
01:21:00.151 --> 01:21:01.111
(planchette slides)

1297
01:21:01.152 --> 01:21:03.363
Mom. what are you doing?

1298
01:21:03.405 --> 01:21:06.074
- It's okay. honey.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1299
01:21:06.783 --> 01:21:07.659
Don't worry.

1300
01:21:07.701 --> 01:21:09.619
Will you take my blood?

1301
01:21:09.661 --> 01:21:10.912
(planchette slides)

1302
01:21:10.954 --> 01:21:12.038
Mom. no!

1303
01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:15.000
(Viola gasping)

1304
01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:16.918
(planchette slides)

1305
01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:21.047
Mary Blackwood. I know
you were innocent.

1306
01:21:21.756 --> 01:21:23.216
I know you're angry.

1307
01:21:24.592 --> 01:21:26.928
I want you to be free.

1308
01:21:28.179 --> 01:21:31.099
Let go of the anger. Mary.

1309
01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:32.684
Leave this realm.

1310
01:21:33.435 --> 01:21:34.561
[Mary] Derek.

1311
01:21:34.602 --> 01:21:37.939
- Don't cause anyone
else any more pain.

1312
01:21:39.524 --> 01:21:44.320
Don't cause my mother
the pain you felt

1313
01:21:44.362 --> 01:21:46.948
when you were taken
from your children.

1314
01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:49.909
Close the door!

1315
01:21:49.951 --> 01:21:50.744
(door slams)

1316
01:21:50.785 --> 01:21:53.663
(Derek gasping)

1317
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:58.710
Is she gone?

1318
01:21:58.752 --> 01:21:59.461
She's gone.

1319
01:22:00.712 --> 01:22:02.547
You've made her close the door.

1320
01:22:02.589 --> 01:22:03.465
You did it!

1321
01:22:06.092 --> 01:22:07.469
I knew you could do it.

1322
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:08.470
(blood splatters)

1323
01:22:08.511 --> 01:22:09.387
(Viola gasps)

1324
01:22:09.429 --> 01:22:10.930
(Sarah screams)
(heart beating)

1325
01:22:10.972 --> 01:22:13.141
(Viola screams)

1326
01:22:13.183 --> 01:22:15.977
(body thuds)

1327
01:22:18.772 --> 01:22:21.566
(Mary cackles)

1328
01:22:24.152 --> 01:22:27.655
(heart thuds)

1329
01:22:27.697 --> 01:22:29.449
Your blood is next.

1330
01:22:30.867 --> 01:22:33.578
(eerie music)

1331
01:22:37.999 --> 01:22:41.252
(distorted cackling)

1332
01:22:48.802 --> 01:22:50.387
You have been avenged. Sarah.

1333
01:22:51.805 --> 01:22:53.014
Join me

1334
01:22:55.141 --> 01:22:56.685
for eternity.

1335
01:22:56.726 --> 01:23:01.690
- Mary. get your
hands off my daughter!

1336
01:23:01.731 --> 01:23:03.108
It's too late.

1337
01:23:03.858 --> 01:23:05.110
No more games.

1338
01:23:07.112 --> 01:23:08.071
(fire whooshes)

1339
01:23:08.113 --> 01:23:11.032
(Mary screams)

1340
01:23:13.076 --> 01:23:18.248
(fire roaring)
(Mary screams)

1341
01:23:22.877 --> 01:23:24.629
(dramatic music)

1342
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:26.756
Burn in hell. witch!

1343
01:23:26.798 --> 01:23:29.384
(fire roaring)

1344
01:23:35.015 --> 01:23:37.809
(Mary screams)

1345
01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:41.813
(Sarah gasps)

1346
01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:46.818
[Sarah] Derek!

1347
01:23:47.485 --> 01:23:48.945
Honey. honey. don't look.

1348
01:23:48.987 --> 01:23:50.780
Let's just get you
outta here. okay?

1349
01:23:53.658 --> 01:23:56.036
- You were gonna
sacrifice yourself for me.

1350
01:23:56.077 --> 01:23:58.413
Of course. I'm your mother.

1351
01:23:59.289 --> 01:24:00.707
I'd do anything for you.

1352
01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:05.503
- [Sarah] The Ouija
board! It's gone!

1353
01:24:05.545 --> 01:24:07.797
Oh. it's destroyed forever.

1354
01:24:08.757 --> 01:24:09.591
Are you sure?

1355
01:24:10.258 --> 01:24:12.927
(dramatic music)

1356
01:24:12.969 --> 01:24:13.803
Mom?

1357
01:24:19.392 --> 01:24:21.186
Yeah. I'm sure.

1358
01:24:38.036 --> 01:24:40.747
(door closes)

1359
01:24:42.415 --> 01:24:45.585
(door bells jangle)

1360
01:24:50.131 --> 01:24:52.801
(eerie music)

1361
01:25:25.291 --> 01:25:26.292
Good evening.

1362
01:25:28.253 --> 01:25:29.587
How can I help you?

1363
01:25:33.299 --> 01:25:36.261
(dramatic music)
