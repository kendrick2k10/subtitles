3
00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:13.365
<i>You disappeared on me.
We had an appointment.</i>

4
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.701
The mountains called.

5
00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.663
{\an8}<i>Sadie. it's normal
to be affected by what happened.</i>

6
00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:22.833
{\an8}<i>Death. anyone's. can fill us with urgency.</i>

7
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:24.710
This is not about what happened.

8
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.920
I didn't really know her. but...

9
00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:29.965
She was the same as me.

10
00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:31.884
Same age. same job.

11
00:01:32.426 --> 00:01:35.554
The one time I was in her house.
it was the same as mine.

12
00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:37.973
Nice. but cold.

13
00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:43.812
Empty. except for one sad houseplant.
which is more than I have.

14
00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:45.772
She died alone.

15
00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:51.153
<i>Sadie. stay present.
No big moves. no big changes.</i>

16
00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.574
So don't marry
the rafting guide I just met?

17
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:57.868
{\an8}<i>Maybe start with a houseplant.</i>

18
00:01:57.868 --> 00:01:59.578
I'd probably eat it.

19
00:01:59.578 --> 00:02:02.497
My cold. empty house has a cold.
empty fridge.

20
00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.583
I'm gonna stop for groceries.

21
00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:06.710
{\an8}- <i>Let's check in tomorrow.</i>
- Yeah.

22
00:02:10.506 --> 00:02:14.551
No pesticides. more nutrients.
It just tastes better. you know.

23
00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:17.888
Out of 20.

24
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.644
Sorry. guys.

25
00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:38.116
Five. six. seven. Have a good one.

26
00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:42.538
You know you're gonna need
to buy stock in those trackers.

27
00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:44.706
You'd lose your butt
if it wasn't attached to you.

28
00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:47.334
Well. you lost your hair.
and that was attached.

29
00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:49.670
I walked into that one.

30
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.047
Hey. Cole. Are you okay?

31
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.509
Yeah. heard you got dumped.
Tough break. man.

32
00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:00.305
- Edna.
- I gossip when I'm bored.

33
00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:02.349
For your information. it was mutual.

34
00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.226
That's what everyone says
after getting dumped.

35
00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:05.394
That's true.

36
00:03:05.394 --> 00:03:07.521
Maybe try being a little less needy.
you know?

37
00:03:07.521 --> 00:03:09.022
Girls don't really like that.

38
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.232
I'm not needy.

39
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.986
We just grew apart.

40
00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:16.029
And I really just don't wanna talk
about it.

41
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.450
You wanna go get high?

42
00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.871
I got a edible in the truck.

43
00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:26.957
No. thanks.

44
00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:29.334
Okay. Well. watch my booth.
I'm gonna go get high.

45
00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:32.087
Enjoy.

46
00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.799
- Come on. Here.
- Uh. just that one.

47
00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.344
- Just this one.
- I'll take one too.

48
00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.351
Salmon. Halibut. It's all fresh.

49
00:03:58.155 --> 00:03:59.489
Can I help you?

50
00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:05.454
Yes. thank you. I'm gonna get that one.

51
00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:09.124
Begonia. Nice choice.

52
00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.335
- Is that what it is?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:14.505
It is pretty.

54
00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:15.589
Yeah.

55
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:23.222
Don't let any pets eat the leaves.
They can be slightly toxic.

56
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.558
Pretty and slightly toxic.

57
00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:29.645
What is it with me and roommates?

58
00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:31.813
Didn't realize you roomed
with all of my exes.

59
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.572
How much watering does it need?

60
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.535
Every other day or so.
Begonias need a little bit of love.

61
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.374
I'm actually gone a lot for work.

62
00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:52.459
Okay.

63
00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.045
Okay. got it. Less love.

64
00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:57.422
What about a snake plant?

65
00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.008
They only need watering every two weeks.

66
00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:06.014
Sometimes I'm gone longer.
like a month or two.

67
00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:08.058
Okay.

68
00:05:09.393 --> 00:05:12.104
Sorry. then why do you want a plant
if you're never home?

69
00:05:12.104 --> 00:05:14.189
I'm not never home. I just--

70
00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:19.027
How about if you find me
something a little less needy?

71
00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:25.033
Right. Why not just get a plastic plant?

72
00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.285
That's sad.

73
00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:27.911
Well. not as sad as killing a plant.

74
00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.415
And some of the new ones.
they look totally real.

75
00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:33.834
No amount of neglect will kill them.

76
00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:35.335
Neglect?

77
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.338
You know what. I'm gonna get this one.

78
00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.966
- Yep.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.683
Sorry. I can't sell you this plant.

80
00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:52.102
I can't sell it to you in good conscience.

81
00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:55.939
Good conscience?
What are you. the patron saint of plants?

82
00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.400
I just don't feel comfortable
selling a plant to someone

83
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.568
that can be so indifferent

84
00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:00.986
- towards a living thing.
- Indifferent?

85
00:06:00.986 --> 00:06:02.988
Is this how you speak
to all your customers?

86
00:06:02.988 --> 00:06:05.115
'Cause if you do.
I'm shocked that you sell anything at all.

87
00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.159
No. as a matter of fact.
this isn't even my stall.

88
00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.577
I just don't wanna be an accomplice...

89
00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:10.704
You're refusing to sell me a plant
that you don't even own?

90
00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:11.914
- That's right.
- Hey. Cole.

91
00:06:11.914 --> 00:06:13.957
- What's going on?
- Hi.

92
00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:15.918
- Are these your plants?
- Yes.

93
00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:18.420
Awesome. 'Cause Farmer Clown here
won't sell me one.

94
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.048
- Farmer Clown. That's funny.
- The plant is $10. honey.

95
00:06:21.048 --> 00:06:22.841
Edna. sh--

96
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:26.386
All right. you know what?
Hey. want a plant? Here. Cactus.

97
00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:29.139
Requires the bare minimum love
a human can give.

98
00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.974
so you'll totally kill it.

99
00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:36.021
You should fire him.

100
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.024
- She's just gonna...
- Have a good one.

101
00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.526
RIP. little guy.

102
00:06:41.652 --> 00:06:43.529
- Can you believe that?
- No.

103
00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.114
I thought for sure you two
were gonna exchange numbers.

104
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:47.824
- What?
- Yes.

105
00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.577
I thought. under all that stupid fighting.
you were flirting.

106
00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:52.871
- Wait. we were flirting?
- Are you kidding me?

107
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:57.084
Are you high?
The sexual tension was off the charts.

108
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:02.673
Edna. watch my stall.

109
00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:05.384
Hey. hey. hey. sorr--

110
00:07:05.384 --> 00:07:07.886
- Sorry. Sorry. sorry.
- Shit.

111
00:07:08.554 --> 00:07:13.892
Hi. Hi. Yep. it's me.

112
00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.519
Sorry. Just...

113
00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:19.940
Are you here to rescue the plant?

114
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.276
No. No. I'm not. That's funny.

115
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.152
No. I was just--

116
00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:26.738
Well. I was just wondering
if you wanted to.

117
00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:30.158
you know. go out sometime.

118
00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:33.871
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:35.706
Yeah. I mean. I--

120
00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:38.625
I mean. I know we were kind of...

121
00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:40.294
arguing back there.

122
00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:43.797
but I thought that underneath it.
there was...

123
00:07:45.924 --> 00:07:46.842
something.

124
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.636
Something?

125
00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.513
Yeah.

126
00:07:53.098 --> 00:07:54.349
I'm wrong. aren't I?

127
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.686
Well. this is embarrassing.

128
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:04.109
Sorry. sorry. I misread it.

129
00:08:16.914 --> 00:08:18.207
I can use a coffee.

130
00:08:18.207 --> 00:08:22.377
A coffee?
You want to get a-- Yeah. Like. now?

131
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.505
Yes. now.

132
00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:27.424
Get in.

133
00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.593
Yeah. well-- Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:36.350
- I'm Cole. by the way.
- Seat belt.

135
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.184
Yep. yep. yep. Sorry.

136
00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:41.897
I'll just hang on.

137
00:08:43.607 --> 00:08:45.025
Okay.

138
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.831
I like the canal.
It reminds me of Amsterdam.

139
00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:02.626
So. art curators travel a lot?

140
00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:05.379
Oh. yeah. All over the world.

141
00:09:07.506 --> 00:09:08.924
I love it.

142
00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:12.177
Just jumping on a plane. moment's notice.

143
00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:15.681
and then. you know.
stepping out into a new place.

144
00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:18.225
Wow.

145
00:09:19.893 --> 00:09:22.187
Oh. gosh.
don't tell me you're one of those big.

146
00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.898
tough guys who's afraid
to leave the country.

147
00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:27.568
Okay. first of all.
thank you for calling me big and tough.

148
00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:31.071
Let's keep that going.
And I travel. I travel a lot.

149
00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:33.949
- Really?
- Yeah.

150
00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:36.243
Yeah. I think the trips
that you plan the least

151
00:09:36.243 --> 00:09:37.995
are the ones that give you the most.

152
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.457
I agree.

153
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.838
<i>Lincoln got shot just across
the street. and he died right next door.</i>

154
00:09:47.838 --> 00:09:49.882
Sounds like you're a big fan of Lincoln.

155
00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:52.217
Well. history in general.

156
00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:55.012
I majored in agriculture.
but I minored in history.

157
00:09:55.012 --> 00:09:56.221
That's my real passion.

158
00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:58.640
You know. I'm writing a book.

159
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.310
- You are?
- Yeah.

160
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.354
History of farming?

161
00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:08.317
No. it's about the rise
and fall of different empires

162
00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:10.527
and the critical role that agriculture--

163
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.529
Yeah. it's about farming.

164
00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:15.490
So how's it going?

165
00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:18.952
Well. it's on pause for now.

166
00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:22.664
My dad got hurt a few years ago.
so I came back to help him with the farm.

167
00:10:22.664 --> 00:10:24.875
So not a lot of time for writing.

168
00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:27.211
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:29.588
It's okay. I'll finish it.

170
00:10:31.882 --> 00:10:34.510
You've never seen <i>The Exorcist</i>?
It's a classic.

171
00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.388
It's one of the scariest movies ever made.
and they filmed it right here.

172
00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.265
I don't know.
I don't get scared by movies.

173
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:42.935
Yeah.
because you haven't seen <i>The Exorcist</i>.

174
00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:45.437
No. 'cause you can choose
not being scared.

175
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:49.066
Okay. Little bet. Race me to the top.

176
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.486
And if I beat you.
you gotta tell me what scares you.

177
00:10:54.196 --> 00:10:56.907
- I love this.
- All right. I like the confidence.

178
00:10:57.407 --> 00:10:59.743
Hang on. wait. wait. wait. wait.
Let me just-- Hang on.

179
00:11:01.203 --> 00:11:04.248
Come on. Put all that in here.

180
00:11:04.248 --> 00:11:08.168
Are you gonna carry all my stuff?
Okay. Wait. wait. wait.

181
00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:10.963
You looking for pity?

182
00:11:10.963 --> 00:11:13.048
That's exactly what I'm looking for.

183
00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.093
Oh. my friend.

184
00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:18.887
- You ready?
- Yeah.

185
00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:21.014
And go!

186
00:11:42.619 --> 00:11:44.121
You know. I'm guessing you work out.

187
00:11:45.289 --> 00:11:46.456
Are you okay?

188
00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.083
Oh. yeah.

189
00:11:54.464 --> 00:11:56.633
Oh. my God. I love Monet.

190
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:11.064
So you can just choose not
to be scared. huh?

191
00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:16.945
When I was six.

192
00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.823
my mom and I fled our country...

193
00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:22.409
on a raft.

194
00:12:23.327 --> 00:12:25.495
Oh. my God. That must have been--

195
00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:27.247
Worse than you can imagine.

196
00:12:28.624 --> 00:12:33.921
The sun. the waves.
sharks. people screaming. crying.

197
00:12:34.505 --> 00:12:36.632
I was terrified. Everyone was.

198
00:12:36.632 --> 00:12:41.178
They wanted to go back.
but my mom was so strong.

199
00:12:42.262 --> 00:12:45.933
She kept us all going for five days.

200
00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:48.977
until we made it.

201
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:54.024
And I still remember how they looked
at her on the beach.

202
00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:59.363
I just. you know. wanted to be like her.

203
00:12:59.363 --> 00:13:01.532
strong and brave.

204
00:13:02.574 --> 00:13:07.371
So that's the day I decided I was never
going to be afraid ever again.

205
00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:10.707
And I'm not.

206
00:13:15.504 --> 00:13:16.630
I believe you.

207
00:13:18.257 --> 00:13:21.385
But it is very cute that you're scared
of this movie with the little girl.

208
00:13:21.385 --> 00:13:24.680
- Oh. my God. This is my own fault.
- That's-- What's the name again?

209
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.306
- It's <i>The Exorcist</i>.
- I have to watch it now.

210
00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:29.101
One of the scariest movies of all time.
You're gonna have nightmares for a month.

211
00:13:29.101 --> 00:13:30.185
- Wow.
- Just watch.

212
00:13:34.565 --> 00:13:36.859
This has just been incredible.

213
00:13:36.859 --> 00:13:38.110
It was great.

214
00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:40.904
And not to be too forward.

215
00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:44.324
but if you ever felt
like getting a drink sometime...

216
00:13:44.324 --> 00:13:45.409
How about now?

217
00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.036
Okay.

218
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:50.330
I know a great place.

219
00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:01.466
Hey!

220
00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:10.684
Thank you.

221
00:14:12.186 --> 00:14:13.187
You are amazing.

222
00:14:13.187 --> 00:14:15.230
How do you make that look cool?

223
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.316
That's rockaoke. No dignity here.

224
00:14:17.316 --> 00:14:21.236
And next up. we have Cole Turner.
turnin' up the heat

225
00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:24.239
- with "20th Century Boy."
- What happened?

226
00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:28.285
- No. no. no. no. no. No. no.
- I might have put your name down.

227
00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:29.912
- Come on. Cole.
- Sadie. Sadie.

228
00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:32.039
Sadie.
I get nervous singing in the shower.

229
00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.540
- Just give it a go.
- I'm not a performer.

230
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.792
- Cole! Cole! Cole!
- Cole Turner.

231
00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:38.086
- Where is Cole Turner?
- Please.

232
00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:39.463
I can't.

233
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:42.674
He's not gonna do it.
Just call someone else.

234
00:14:43.342 --> 00:14:45.135
Give me the mic.

235
00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:49.765
Thank you.

236
00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.951
Now. you're out there.
seeing the world. traveling.

237
00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:13.705
meeting interesting people.
It's quite a life.

238
00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:17.167
Lately. I'm not so sure.

239
00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:22.631
Someone I know just died. A coworker.

240
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:26.093
It got me thinking.

241
00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:30.556
You know. there are all
these things you want in life...

242
00:15:31.557 --> 00:15:34.977
and it's so hard to find someone who--

243
00:15:38.897 --> 00:15:41.692
If only people
could be more like your cactus.

244
00:15:41.692 --> 00:15:43.569
Not needing watering all the time?

245
00:15:44.695 --> 00:15:46.154
Right. Exactly.

246
00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:48.991
- Just living their own lives.
- Yeah.

247
00:15:48.991 --> 00:15:51.660
Not needing someone else.
like. nourishing them.

248
00:15:52.244 --> 00:15:53.537
That makes sense.

249
00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:34.912
Morning.

250
00:16:34.912 --> 00:16:38.081
- What?
- Nothing.

251
00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:42.461
Good night then.

252
00:16:42.461 --> 00:16:43.795
I mean. good morning.

253
00:16:43.795 --> 00:16:45.380
This was quite a date.

254
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.882
You mean a day?

255
00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:51.178
Right. Yeah. that's-- Officially.
That's a first.

256
00:16:51.178 --> 00:16:52.930
Yeah. me too.

257
00:16:57.392 --> 00:16:59.937
Well. goodbye.

258
00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:02.731
Goodbye.

259
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:25.045
Well. I look forward to our next day.

260
00:17:28.882 --> 00:17:31.093
- Bye.
- Bye.

261
00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:48.235
Be a cactus.

262
00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:52.739
No big moves. No big moves.

263
00:17:52.739 --> 00:17:54.700
Be a cactus.

264
00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:35.157
Wow.

265
00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:38.994
First farmer?

266
00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:43.498
Yeah.

267
00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:46.919
You know that power you felt?
That's from the land.

268
00:19:15.405 --> 00:19:17.407
Hey. Coleslaw.

269
00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:18.575
Hey. Dad.

270
00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:20.744
Thanks for closing up the stand
for me last night.

271
00:19:20.744 --> 00:19:23.372
Not a problem.
Edna gave me a hand. She was high.

272
00:19:23.372 --> 00:19:26.041
Look who's finally home.

273
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:27.501
God. take it easy. Mom.

274
00:19:27.501 --> 00:19:29.336
He just got back
from having sex with a stranger.

275
00:19:29.336 --> 00:19:30.879
not fighting the Germans.

276
00:19:30.879 --> 00:19:34.466
Okay. now. come on. Spill the beans.

277
00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:38.262
Well. her name is Sadie. and she is...

278
00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:43.225
She's incredible.
I mean. I know this sounds a little crazy.

279
00:19:43.225 --> 00:19:47.145
but I think she might be the one.

280
00:19:48.272 --> 00:19:49.857
Really? Well. that's fast.

281
00:19:49.857 --> 00:19:51.900
Well. I can't wait to meet her.

282
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.278
Did you tell her you wrestled
in high school?

283
00:19:54.278 --> 00:19:56.822
- No.
- What is this?

284
00:19:56.822 --> 00:19:59.658
You took a selfie
in bed while she was asleep?

285
00:19:59.658 --> 00:20:00.951
Dude. that's weird.

286
00:20:00.951 --> 00:20:03.745
That's what serial killers do
before they kill their victims

287
00:20:03.745 --> 00:20:04.955
and harvest their eyelids.

288
00:20:04.955 --> 00:20:07.374
I was happy.
I wanted to preserve the moment.

289
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:10.377
- He is doing it again.
- Doing what?

290
00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:13.755
It's just-- Cole. you can get a bit--

291
00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:14.965
Smothering. needy. pathetic.

292
00:20:14.965 --> 00:20:16.300
- desperate. delusional.
- What?

293
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:19.678
Yeah. stuff like this.
The stupid gifts. the constant texting.

294
00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.889
I mean. that's why things never
worked out with Fiona.

295
00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:23.182
Fiona was a bitch.

296
00:20:23.765 --> 00:20:26.101
You're a hopeless romantic.
just like your mom.

297
00:20:26.101 --> 00:20:27.811
Tell her you wrestled in high school.

298
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:31.023
Look. I'm not needy.
and I'm not smothering.

299
00:20:31.023 --> 00:20:34.693
And for your information.
I've sent Sadie one text today. One.

300
00:20:36.612 --> 00:20:40.657
Three. And some light emoji stuff.
but that doesn't count.

301
00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:41.992
Emoji stuff counts.

302
00:20:41.992 --> 00:20:45.037
He is gonna blow it. Mark my words.

303
00:20:45.037 --> 00:20:46.121
I'm not gonna bl--

304
00:20:47.581 --> 00:20:48.832
She really is great.

305
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:51.418
You'll see.

306
00:21:14.775 --> 00:21:19.446
Hey. Head in the game. Coleslaw.
Come on. A lot of honey to harvest.

307
00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:34.920
You need some slack?

308
00:21:35.546 --> 00:21:39.341
We're good. Hang on.
Just gotta hook it in. One sec.

309
00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:46.682
Should I get it? I can get it.
It's right here. So easy for me.

310
00:21:49.351 --> 00:21:50.352
Hello?

311
00:21:55.691 --> 00:21:56.817
Good news.

312
00:21:56.817 --> 00:21:59.236
Mortgage refinancing rates
have never been lower.

313
00:22:12.916 --> 00:22:13.917
Any word?

314
00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:18.672
Maybe your phone's broken.

315
00:22:18.672 --> 00:22:20.340
Yeah. maybe you should do a hard reset.

316
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.718
There's nothing wrong with my phone.

317
00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:24.928
No. no. no. I meant with your life.

318
00:22:24.928 --> 00:22:27.556
You know. grow a pair.
move out of your parents' house.

319
00:22:27.556 --> 00:22:28.682
Guesthouse.

320
00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:32.311
Well. I'm sure
there's a logical reason for it.

321
00:22:32.311 --> 00:22:33.687
There is.

322
00:22:33.687 --> 00:22:37.065
He came off way too strong.
so she ghosted him.

323
00:22:37.065 --> 00:22:38.150
Ghosted?

324
00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.694
Yeah.
It's when someone breaks off all contact.

325
00:22:40.694 --> 00:22:43.780
For example. let's just say a young lady
makes a horrible.

326
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.199
horrible mistake one night.

327
00:22:45.199 --> 00:22:48.785
and then the guy just keeps
on texting her with emojis.

328
00:22:48.785 --> 00:22:50.495
over and over.

329
00:22:50.495 --> 00:22:52.539
She did not ghost me. okay?

330
00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:55.709
- She did.
- You wanna pick this up?

331
00:22:55.709 --> 00:22:56.919
No.

332
00:22:56.919 --> 00:23:00.714
Hey. pal. you're huffing and puffing.
Why don't you take a hit off your scuba?

333
00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.592
Come on. hey. Let's go.

334
00:23:07.513 --> 00:23:08.597
Oh. my God.

335
00:23:10.349 --> 00:23:13.685
Sorry. You did the leave-behind
with your inhaler?

336
00:23:13.685 --> 00:23:16.396
Come on.
Isn't your asthma sad enough already?

337
00:23:16.396 --> 00:23:18.649
It wasn't a leave-behind.
I forgot it in her purse.

338
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:22.694
And it has one of those tiles on it.
Those tracking things that I use.

339
00:23:23.695 --> 00:23:26.657
All right. Drumroll. please.

340
00:23:26.657 --> 00:23:29.201
The woman of my dreams is in...

341
00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:32.371
- London.
- England?

342
00:23:32.371 --> 00:23:35.499
- London. the Lady in the Mist.
- No one calls it that.

343
00:23:35.499 --> 00:23:38.001
- The Gray Lady.
- No. that's <i>New York Times</i>.

344
00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:40.254
- Are ya sure?
- Yes.

345
00:23:40.254 --> 00:23:41.755
She does travel a lot for work.

346
00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:43.590
Well. there you go. That makes sense.

347
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.593
She probably got called away last minute
on this job and had to rush over there.

348
00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:49.388
You know.
international calling plans and whatnot.

349
00:23:49.388 --> 00:23:51.348
I bet she hasn't even seen your texts.

350
00:23:51.348 --> 00:23:53.684
Yeah. yeah. that makes sense. Okay.

351
00:23:53.684 --> 00:23:55.686
- Exactly.
- Okay. so this is fine?

352
00:23:55.686 --> 00:23:57.187
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

353
00:23:57.187 --> 00:24:00.190
Cole. you should go over there.

354
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.318
- What?
- Yeah. show up and surprise her.

355
00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:06.530
It'd be a romantic gesture.
something we can tell our grandchildren.

356
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.033
Mom. you can't be serious.
Cole. going to London? No.

357
00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:12.286
Why not? This is a perfect opportunity

358
00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:15.998
to get out there
and grab life by the horns.

359
00:24:15.998 --> 00:24:17.249
She's gonna think you're psycho.

360
00:24:17.875 --> 00:24:20.460
Or she'll think that I'm the kind of guy

361
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.546
that's willing to jump
on a plane at a moment's notice.

362
00:24:22.546 --> 00:24:25.132
Wait. but you're not that kind of guy.
You do not travel anywhere.

363
00:24:25.132 --> 00:24:27.217
- You haven't even left the country.
- That's not true.

364
00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:28.886
He was conceived in Ontario.

365
00:24:28.886 --> 00:24:30.429
Cole. you can do this.

366
00:24:30.429 --> 00:24:32.264
Yeah. but what about the farm?
There's so much to do.

367
00:24:32.264 --> 00:24:35.434
- I can't just leave you here.
- Coleslaw. don't worry about the farm.

368
00:24:35.434 --> 00:24:37.936
- Yeah.
- By the horns. Come on.

369
00:24:37.936 --> 00:24:39.229
Yeah. go to her.

370
00:24:41.315 --> 00:24:42.316
You know what I have?

371
00:24:42.316 --> 00:24:45.027
You remember that spring break
where I was supposed to go to Spain

372
00:24:45.027 --> 00:24:46.820
and I gave up my seat and I got a voucher?

373
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:48.697
That is my point exactly. Cole.

374
00:24:48.697 --> 00:24:52.284
You missed spring break
to get a stupid voucher.

375
00:24:52.284 --> 00:24:54.411
which you never used.

376
00:24:54.411 --> 00:24:56.663
I mean. that is the type of guy you are.

377
00:24:56.663 --> 00:24:57.789
Not today.

378
00:24:57.789 --> 00:25:01.376
- You still have--
- I've got goose bumps.

379
00:25:02.085 --> 00:25:03.003
Thanks for the warning.

380
00:25:03.003 --> 00:25:04.588
I'm going to London.

381
00:25:13.555 --> 00:25:17.559
{\an8}So it's not like a weird stalker thing.
It's just a grand romantic gesture.

382
00:25:17.559 --> 00:25:20.938
Yeah. that is amazing. mate.
I mean. I admire your confidence.

383
00:25:20.938 --> 00:25:24.858
5.000 miles to surprise a girl
who you've only met once.

384
00:25:24.858 --> 00:25:26.818
I mean.
that is the epitome of romance. mate.

385
00:25:26.818 --> 00:25:28.570
Yeah. exactly. See. you get it.

386
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.864
Especially if she's the one
who ghosted you.

387
00:25:30.864 --> 00:25:33.575
I was-- Wait. what?
No. no. she didn't ghost me.

388
00:25:33.575 --> 00:25:35.619
She just doesn't
have an international calling plan.

389
00:25:36.286 --> 00:25:37.412
Right.

390
00:25:37.412 --> 00:25:41.416
An international art curator.
doesn't have an overseas calling plan.

391
00:25:41.416 --> 00:25:42.626
That's very unusual.

392
00:25:44.253 --> 00:25:45.587
Talking of romantic gestures.

393
00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:47.464
what's that you got in the back then. hey?

394
00:25:47.464 --> 00:25:49.508
- Is it a little cactus. is it?
- Yeah.

395
00:25:49.508 --> 00:25:53.428
Yeah. this is a little inside joke
between us.

396
00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:56.557
Little cactus.
I'm sure she'll split her sides laughing.

397
00:25:59.518 --> 00:26:04.648
Right. we are nearly here. Tower Bridge.

398
00:26:09.945 --> 00:26:12.197
That'll be 137 quid. please.

399
00:26:13.407 --> 00:26:16.326
- That's kind of a lot. isn't it?
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. it's outrageous.

400
00:26:16.326 --> 00:26:19.079
You never get a cab from the airport
to the center of London.

401
00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:22.666
It'll cost you a small fortune. mate.
Yeah. Toodle-pip.

402
00:26:33.844 --> 00:26:36.180
Take care. now. Thanks very much.

403
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:41.518
Have a good evening. Have a good night.

404
00:28:07.354 --> 00:28:12.818
Let me tell you how
this will be. One for you. 19 for me.

405
00:28:13.318 --> 00:28:16.029
'Cause I'm the taxman.

406
00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.865
Listen to me.

407
00:28:17.865 --> 00:28:21.493
I can't believe I'm quoting
"The Taxman" to you.

408
00:28:21.493 --> 00:28:25.706
So lame. I really am turning into my dad.

409
00:28:25.706 --> 00:28:27.207
It's true what they say.

410
00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:31.378
When you meet a celebrity.
your IQ drops 50 points.

411
00:28:32.171 --> 00:28:34.798
- Where am I?
- It's just-- You're a living legend.

412
00:28:34.798 --> 00:28:37.509
Stopping our shipment in Turkey.

413
00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:39.261
the assassination in Berlin

414
00:28:39.887 --> 00:28:42.890
and now this thing with Elena
and the passcode.

415
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:47.895
The boss talks about you all the time.
You've become an obsession for him.

416
00:28:47.895 --> 00:28:52.024
"The Taxman killed Elena.
The Taxman has the passcode.

417
00:28:52.024 --> 00:28:55.819
Oh. how I want to find
and murder the Taxman."

418
00:28:55.819 --> 00:28:57.738
And now here you are.

419
00:28:57.738 --> 00:29:00.365
No. no. I'm not a taxman. I'm a farmer.

420
00:29:00.365 --> 00:29:05.412
I came to London to surprise a girl.
and these guys. they jumped me.

421
00:29:05.412 --> 00:29:06.788
Textbook evasion.

422
00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:10.501
Frankly. a little disappointing.
but the performance?

423
00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:11.710
Sublime.

424
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.879
It's like you truly believe
what you're saying.

425
00:29:13.879 --> 00:29:15.255
Because I'm telling the truth.

426
00:29:15.255 --> 00:29:17.466
You have the wrong guy.
My name is Cole Turner.

427
00:29:17.466 --> 00:29:19.760
My passport's right over there in the bag.
in the front flap.

428
00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:24.515
Sublime.
It truly is an honor to torture you today.

429
00:29:25.224 --> 00:29:27.684
Okay. just wait. Wait.

430
00:29:27.684 --> 00:29:31.063
- Normally. I begin with the punching.
- Wait a minute.

431
00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:36.360
You see. it causes me a little pain too.

432
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:39.613
I'm all about sharing the experience.

433
00:29:39.613 --> 00:29:42.199
My therapist says that I'm an empath.

434
00:29:42.199 --> 00:29:46.036
which means that I'm deeply attuned
to others' feelings.

435
00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:52.543
But alas. the boss is in a real tizzy
about the passcode.

436
00:29:54.378 --> 00:29:58.465
Are you familiar
with the Schmidt sting pain index?

437
00:29:58.465 --> 00:30:01.093
Wait. the what? Wait a minute.

438
00:30:01.093 --> 00:30:06.515
It's a rating system for the pain
caused by the bites and stings of insects.

439
00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:10.561
From the simple ouch
of the western honeybee

440
00:30:10.561 --> 00:30:15.274
to the spray-and-pray
of the Latin American bullet ant

441
00:30:16.108 --> 00:30:19.570
that you can see primed
and ready in that box on the table.

442
00:30:20.237 --> 00:30:23.198
Spray-and-pray is short
for "spray in your pants

443
00:30:23.991 --> 00:30:27.160
and pray for the merciful release
of death."

444
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.453
Excuse me. sir.

445
00:30:29.371 --> 00:30:31.248
will you just grab that bag
for me quickly?

446
00:30:31.248 --> 00:30:33.375
I promise.
this is just a big misunderstanding--

447
00:30:33.375 --> 00:30:37.713
Normally. we like to start slow
and build our way up.

448
00:30:37.713 --> 00:30:40.382
But you are special.

449
00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:46.597
so we begin with the murder hornet.

450
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:49.600
Shit. Shit.

451
00:30:50.434 --> 00:30:54.229
Unless. of course.
you want to reveal the passcode.

452
00:30:54.229 --> 00:30:57.024
I don't know any passcode!
I'm telling you. you have the wrong guy.

453
00:30:57.024 --> 00:30:58.150
My name is Cole Turner.

454
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.068
Just look at the passport.
It's right there in the bag.

455
00:31:00.068 --> 00:31:03.655
That's just great.
This is going to be fun.

456
00:31:04.698 --> 00:31:07.159
For me. not for you.

457
00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:09.912
Holy shit. Holy shit. Wait. wait--

458
00:31:10.495 --> 00:31:12.247
God. Shit! Shit!

459
00:31:19.087 --> 00:31:20.380
You.

460
00:31:27.638 --> 00:31:28.847
Can you walk?

461
00:31:28.847 --> 00:31:31.475
- What?
- Can you walk. Cole?

462
00:31:33.018 --> 00:31:33.936
Sadie.

463
00:31:37.731 --> 00:31:41.944
Head down. mouth closed.
Follow me before anyone sounds the alarm.

464
00:31:44.655 --> 00:31:48.158
- Know how to use a gun?
- Yeah. Yeah. yeah. But--

465
00:31:48.158 --> 00:31:52.788
Shoot anyone who's not me.
Stay on my six. Let's go.

466
00:31:56.792 --> 00:31:58.544
Sadie. Geez.

467
00:31:59.837 --> 00:32:02.381
Sadie. what the hell is going on?
Who are these people?

468
00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:04.132
Bad guys.

469
00:32:04.132 --> 00:32:06.885
They set a trap for one of our agents.
and you fell into it.

470
00:32:06.885 --> 00:32:09.304
Agents. Art agents?

471
00:32:09.304 --> 00:32:11.098
- Over here.
- Down!

472
00:32:13.934 --> 00:32:16.228
Not an art agent. Got it.

473
00:32:18.355 --> 00:32:21.608
Sorry. there's a lot going on.
Plus those guys drugged me.

474
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:24.695
Who are you?

475
00:32:24.695 --> 00:32:28.240
CIA. At least.
until they find out about this fiasco.

476
00:32:29.157 --> 00:32:30.576
Keep moving.

477
00:32:32.703 --> 00:32:34.788
My God. you're a spy!

478
00:32:37.124 --> 00:32:38.792
Do you actually know where you're going?

479
00:32:42.087 --> 00:32:43.380
Get down!

480
00:32:46.675 --> 00:32:47.676
Behind you!

481
00:32:52.556 --> 00:32:53.473
You hurt?

482
00:32:54.516 --> 00:32:58.145
No. it's the most amazing thing I've--

483
00:32:59.605 --> 00:33:02.900
I'm so confused.
They kept asking me about the Taxman.

484
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.403
- They asked you about the Taxman?
- No. they think I am a Taxman.

485
00:33:06.403 --> 00:33:08.530
They think you're the Taxman?

486
00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.866
That the Taxman would actually fall
for that lazy trap?

487
00:33:10.866 --> 00:33:13.202
They caught the Taxman. and it's you?

488
00:33:17.998 --> 00:33:19.625
- You're the Taxman!
- Oh. my God.

489
00:33:20.167 --> 00:33:21.335
Oh. my God!

490
00:33:22.169 --> 00:33:23.545
All right. Check down here.

491
00:33:26.215 --> 00:33:27.299
Freeze!

492
00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:40.479
Shoot him!

493
00:33:41.438 --> 00:33:42.689
- Hey. hey!
- Shoot him!

494
00:33:42.689 --> 00:33:44.191
Just stick 'em up.

495
00:33:49.696 --> 00:33:51.615
You said you could shoot!

496
00:33:51.615 --> 00:33:53.492
At tin cans. not people.

497
00:33:56.245 --> 00:33:57.704
Sorry. sorry. sorry.

498
00:34:00.874 --> 00:34:01.917
Here.

499
00:34:02.793 --> 00:34:04.002
There! Go!

500
00:34:06.922 --> 00:34:08.130
- Move! Move!
- Where they at?

501
00:34:11.092 --> 00:34:13.053
Art curator. my ass.

502
00:34:13.053 --> 00:34:17.224
I thought you were different too.
Sweet. fun. low-maintenance.

503
00:34:17.224 --> 00:34:19.810
I can't believe I was gonna call you
when I got back.

504
00:34:22.437 --> 00:34:23.856
Cover me.

505
00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:39.913
Cole.

506
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.045
Were you really gonna call me
when you got back?

507
00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:52.759
Yes. until you texted me 11 times
in two days.

508
00:34:52.759 --> 00:34:56.388
- Seven. Emoji stuff doesn't count.
- Yes. it does.

509
00:34:57.014 --> 00:34:59.308
Emoji stuff counts. Move.

510
00:35:24.041 --> 00:35:26.335
- Come on.
- Where the hell are we?

511
00:35:42.309 --> 00:35:44.770
Jump! Cole. come on!

512
00:35:50.234 --> 00:35:52.694
- I swallowed a rock.
- Keep going!

513
00:36:11.296 --> 00:36:12.339
Cover me.

514
00:36:20.556 --> 00:36:21.557
Stop!

515
00:36:22.683 --> 00:36:23.642
Get off the bus.

516
00:36:37.072 --> 00:36:38.198
Come on!

517
00:36:45.622 --> 00:36:47.875
- You're never gonna make it through.
- We're not going that way.

518
00:36:56.967 --> 00:36:59.136
Do you know what you're doing?
Have you done this before?

519
00:36:59.136 --> 00:37:00.637
I'm gonna let you think yes.

520
00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:30.292
I cannot believe you got me kidnapped
and tortured all after one date.

521
00:37:30.292 --> 00:37:32.085
You're the one who flew to London.

522
00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:44.848
Holy shit!

523
00:37:50.938 --> 00:37:52.689
- You are unbelievable!
- What?

524
00:37:52.689 --> 00:37:55.484
You stalkered your way across the ocean
to find me.

525
00:37:55.484 --> 00:37:57.653
That is not cactus behavior!

526
00:38:00.364 --> 00:38:01.949
Don't use stalker as a verb.

527
00:38:02.574 --> 00:38:04.409
And it was a romantic gesture!

528
00:38:10.332 --> 00:38:11.875
I checked your records.

529
00:38:11.875 --> 00:38:13.377
You've never even left the country.

530
00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.881
You checked my records?
Who's stalkering now?

531
00:39:53.268 --> 00:39:54.728
Sadie!

532
00:40:24.007 --> 00:40:25.717
Look out!

533
00:40:33.267 --> 00:40:35.644
- Choke him out.
- They usually tap.

534
00:40:35.644 --> 00:40:38.522
He's not going to tap. Just choke him out.

535
00:41:23.817 --> 00:41:25.819
Cole! Are you comfortable?

536
00:41:25.819 --> 00:41:26.904
Sorry. sorry. sorry.

537
00:42:15.244 --> 00:42:16.537
Is that what I think it is?

538
00:42:16.537 --> 00:42:18.163
It was meant to be a joke.

539
00:42:19.206 --> 00:42:21.875
It was a lot funnier
before I used it to kill a man.

540
00:42:27.089 --> 00:42:28.090
Hey.

541
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.801
Time to walk.

542
00:42:36.932 --> 00:42:38.016
Great khans.

543
00:42:39.142 --> 00:42:40.978
they used to cross these lands.

544
00:42:42.145 --> 00:42:43.230
Brutal killers.

545
00:42:47.025 --> 00:42:50.195
It was said if you wanted to find one.

546
00:42:51.989 --> 00:42:53.448
you had to step over the dead.

547
00:42:53.949 --> 00:42:58.537
The Taxman has a face.
No matches in the intelligence databases.

548
00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:00.998
They must be running him off the books.

549
00:43:02.457 --> 00:43:03.458
Clever.

550
00:43:04.626 --> 00:43:06.920
I've got blood on my hands.

551
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.340
It's the blood of bad men.
We did what we had to.

552
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.093
Is that what you tell yourself?

553
00:43:13.093 --> 00:43:14.386
You're a liar.

554
00:43:15.554 --> 00:43:17.139
I'm not the liar here.

555
00:43:18.348 --> 00:43:20.809
I told you things I've never told anyone.

556
00:43:21.643 --> 00:43:22.936
It was all true.

557
00:43:24.271 --> 00:43:25.522
Not all of it!

558
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:31.737
Okay. one lie about my job.

559
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:35.324
I really ate it up too. didn't I?

560
00:43:35.324 --> 00:43:37.993
Especially that sob story
about your coworker that died.

561
00:43:37.993 --> 00:43:39.203
That is low.

562
00:43:40.078 --> 00:43:43.165
That was actually true.
Her name was Elena.

563
00:43:43.165 --> 00:43:44.958
And she really died?

564
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.505
I may have killed her.

565
00:43:50.547 --> 00:43:51.590
What?

566
00:43:52.841 --> 00:43:54.635
She was an enemy agent.

567
00:43:55.385 --> 00:43:56.595
She worked for these guys.

568
00:43:56.595 --> 00:43:58.180
You said she was a coworker.

569
00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.806
She was. In a loose sense.

570
00:43:59.806 --> 00:44:01.767
See. this is what I'm talking about.

571
00:44:01.767 --> 00:44:05.229
- It's just lies and lies and more lies.
- It's not lies and more lies.

572
00:44:05.229 --> 00:44:07.439
It's the sub-lie
of the first original lie.

573
00:44:07.439 --> 00:44:09.858
- You're unbelievable.
- Hey.

574
00:44:10.859 --> 00:44:12.694
Fine. I lied about my job.

575
00:44:12.694 --> 00:44:14.446
But you lied about who you are.

576
00:44:14.446 --> 00:44:16.823
Well. excuse me for fudging a few details

577
00:44:16.823 --> 00:44:19.660
to try and impress
the most amazing woman I've ever met.

578
00:44:22.079 --> 00:44:24.623
- Please.
- Who apparently kills coworkers.

579
00:44:24.623 --> 00:44:27.709
Oh. my God!
She killed innocent people. Cole!

580
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.964
Do you know what? I am done with you.

581
00:44:32.714 --> 00:44:35.425
Head down. shut your mouth
and follow my lead.

582
00:44:36.176 --> 00:44:39.179
The sooner I get rid of you.
the sooner I get back to the mission.

583
00:44:39.179 --> 00:44:40.347
Fine. You know what?

584
00:44:40.347 --> 00:44:43.767
I just want to get away from you
and out of here as fast as possible.

585
00:44:43.767 --> 00:44:44.685
You should.

586
00:44:44.685 --> 00:44:48.355
'Cause I've tangled with these guys
before. and they are ruthless.

587
00:44:48.355 --> 00:44:52.609
And now they think you're me.
so they're looking for you. Taxman.

588
00:45:02.411 --> 00:45:05.998
I'll speak with Utami. Buy us some time.

589
00:45:15.465 --> 00:45:17.384
And the passcode?

590
00:45:17.384 --> 00:45:20.137
Looks like Borislov was too slow.

591
00:45:20.137 --> 00:45:21.221
As usual.

592
00:45:22.931 --> 00:45:25.392
But I finally know
what the Taxman looks like.

593
00:45:25.392 --> 00:45:26.476
so I'll find him.

594
00:45:29.313 --> 00:45:30.689
What is this?

595
00:45:32.316 --> 00:45:33.817
He doesn't know anything.

596
00:45:38.155 --> 00:45:42.034
We cannot afford this kind of failure.

597
00:45:46.163 --> 00:45:49.458
The game we play. it's like no other.

598
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:56.256
If we succeed.

599
00:45:57.299 --> 00:46:00.260
we have wealth. power.

600
00:46:02.095 --> 00:46:05.474
And if we fail. we die.

601
00:46:05.474 --> 00:46:07.851
And that is only if we're lucky.

602
00:46:07.851 --> 00:46:08.977
No. please.

603
00:46:10.562 --> 00:46:13.065
- Please help me.
- No more mistakes.

604
00:46:13.857 --> 00:46:14.858
No.

605
00:46:24.159 --> 00:46:27.788
Get that photo to every bounty hunter
on the continent.

606
00:46:28.455 --> 00:46:30.332
One million dollars. Alive.

607
00:46:30.332 --> 00:46:32.709
He is our only access to that code.

608
00:46:32.709 --> 00:46:37.422
Anyone kills the Taxman.
that bounty moves onto their head.

609
00:47:11.456 --> 00:47:12.457
Be right back.

610
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:57.794
Just like your farmers' market.

611
00:47:59.379 --> 00:48:00.380
Come on.

612
00:48:04.218 --> 00:48:05.427
Where are you taking me?

613
00:48:06.094 --> 00:48:08.764
Back to your farm.
unless you screw this up.

614
00:48:11.016 --> 00:48:12.017
Stay close.

615
00:48:26.198 --> 00:48:27.199
Be cool.

616
00:48:46.093 --> 00:48:47.094
How you doing?

617
00:48:50.305 --> 00:48:52.349
What? Friendly isn't cool?

618
00:48:53.016 --> 00:48:56.520
Well. well. well. Sadie sunflower.

619
00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.480
- Marco.
- Look at you.

620
00:49:04.111 --> 00:49:05.279
Who's your friend?

621
00:49:05.988 --> 00:49:09.157
- I'm--
- He's a civilian I just recovered.

622
00:49:11.785 --> 00:49:13.954
You look ravenous. mate.

623
00:49:13.954 --> 00:49:16.874
Let me put something inside you.

624
00:49:16.874 --> 00:49:17.958
Come on.

625
00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:22.754
Sit down. sit down. Come on. sit down.

626
00:49:23.672 --> 00:49:26.925
The scrap out at the caves.
I should have known that was you.

627
00:49:28.135 --> 00:49:30.721
It was the same people that stole Aztec.

628
00:49:31.638 --> 00:49:33.765
- What's Aztec?
- A biochemical weapon.

629
00:49:33.765 --> 00:49:37.644
Very nasty. Deadly enough
to wipe out the Eastern Seaboard.

630
00:49:37.644 --> 00:49:38.562
That's classified.

631
00:49:38.562 --> 00:49:39.897
They're going to sell it.

632
00:49:41.565 --> 00:49:42.566
Thank you for filling me in.

633
00:49:42.566 --> 00:49:45.611
And they're using those caves
with highly paid protection.

634
00:49:45.611 --> 00:49:47.905
There's only one man
that can pull this off.

635
00:49:47.905 --> 00:49:50.782
Leveque. Disgraced French intelligence.

636
00:49:50.782 --> 00:49:53.327
Played in this sandbox
for most of the war.

637
00:49:53.327 --> 00:49:56.955
and then he went into business
for himself. Arms deals. assassinations.

638
00:49:57.539 --> 00:50:00.209
If he's your target. be careful.
He's a dangerous man.

639
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.754
Anyway. mate. best chaat in town.

640
00:50:03.754 --> 00:50:05.088
Enjoy it.

641
00:50:05.088 --> 00:50:09.134
This is yours. sunflower.
Extra spicy. Just how you like it.

642
00:50:13.222 --> 00:50:17.768
So. are you two. you know. a couple?

643
00:50:17.768 --> 00:50:19.061
- Yeah.
- No.

644
00:50:19.061 --> 00:50:20.687
- Yes. Yeah.
- No.

645
00:50:20.687 --> 00:50:22.814
- It was like five months.
- A long time.

646
00:50:23.524 --> 00:50:26.109
You know. we had a lot in common.
You know. work. Not work.

647
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:27.402
Hey. Mahmoud.

648
00:50:27.402 --> 00:50:28.820
Got it. Subtle.

649
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:34.034
It's not that.
It's just that sometimes it's easier

650
00:50:34.034 --> 00:50:35.536
to date someone in the same profession.

651
00:50:35.536 --> 00:50:36.453
Always.

652
00:50:37.204 --> 00:50:39.414
Although I wouldn't call
what we did dating.

653
00:50:39.414 --> 00:50:40.749
Please. Can we focus?

654
00:50:40.749 --> 00:50:42.167
Well. that's charming. Very cool.

655
00:50:42.167 --> 00:50:43.710
- Okay.
- Very cool.

656
00:50:44.336 --> 00:50:45.337
I need to find Aztec.

657
00:50:46.213 --> 00:50:49.299
And I need your guys to get Cole
back safely to America.

658
00:50:49.299 --> 00:50:52.344
- Who is he really?
- Nobody.

659
00:50:53.303 --> 00:50:54.346
He's a mistake.

660
00:50:55.389 --> 00:50:56.390
You're the mistake.

661
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:58.016
She said she was an art curator.

662
00:50:58.976 --> 00:51:00.352
- Wait a second.
- Oh. my God.

663
00:51:00.936 --> 00:51:02.312
You said-- What?

664
00:51:02.312 --> 00:51:04.773
Is he your boyfriend?

665
00:51:04.773 --> 00:51:05.691
He's very funny.

666
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:07.150
You poor bastard.

667
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:09.695
You thought you met a hottie. right?
Not a Mata Hari.

668
00:51:09.695 --> 00:51:12.114
But. hey. at least the no pants dance
was worth it.

669
00:51:12.114 --> 00:51:14.408
- Oh. God.
- No. it wasn't.

670
00:51:14.408 --> 00:51:15.534
Come on.

671
00:51:15.534 --> 00:51:17.452
Oh. come on. It was. It was for me.

672
00:51:17.452 --> 00:51:18.704
And I lost a hand.

673
00:51:19.204 --> 00:51:20.163
Lost it.

674
00:51:20.747 --> 00:51:23.000
- Wait. You lo--
- Yeah. gone. It's fake.

675
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.418
- Touch it.
- That's because of Sadie?

676
00:51:24.418 --> 00:51:27.462
- Yeah. You can touch it.
- No. I'm okay. How?

677
00:51:27.462 --> 00:51:28.839
When Sadie and I were together.

678
00:51:28.839 --> 00:51:31.300
we took a little
romantic getaway to Myanmar.

679
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.260
No. It was a mission.

680
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.720
There were many positions.

681
00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.514
Don't know if you remember. but anyway.
Things went south.

682
00:51:37.514 --> 00:51:40.559
I got captured. and Sadie took right off.

683
00:51:40.559 --> 00:51:43.896
Turns out that's exactly
what the secret police did to me.

684
00:51:43.896 --> 00:51:46.356
- Oh. my God.
- Yeah. don't worry about it. man.

685
00:51:46.356 --> 00:51:48.859
You got two hands. right.
but only one life.

686
00:51:51.695 --> 00:51:53.614
You know what I miss most. mate? Guess.

687
00:52:00.287 --> 00:52:02.331
- Yeah.
- I used to do that all the time.

688
00:52:02.331 --> 00:52:03.707
Can't do it anymore. can I?

689
00:52:04.416 --> 00:52:07.669
Sorry. You left your boyfriend
to get his hand cut off.

690
00:52:07.669 --> 00:52:09.713
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

691
00:52:10.422 --> 00:52:12.758
I'd have done the same. Mission over man.

692
00:52:12.758 --> 00:52:14.301
Right. sunflower?

693
00:52:14.301 --> 00:52:17.179
Surrounded by lunatics. Wait a minute.

694
00:52:17.179 --> 00:52:19.973
Did you come back to save me or get Aztec?

695
00:52:21.183 --> 00:52:22.893
You were a secondary objective.

696
00:52:22.893 --> 00:52:26.522
- Oh. my God.
- High-priority secondary. I'm sure.

697
00:52:26.522 --> 00:52:28.649
And look at you now. brother. Thriving.

698
00:52:28.649 --> 00:52:30.984
Every word you're saying
is making it worse.

699
00:52:30.984 --> 00:52:33.153
- Every word. I know you're trying. Just--
- Marco.

700
00:52:33.153 --> 00:52:34.738
- This guy.
- Hey.

701
00:52:34.738 --> 00:52:37.824
Are you gonna take him back home or not?

702
00:52:38.825 --> 00:52:39.785
Please say yes.

703
00:52:39.785 --> 00:52:43.956
I'd really hate it if one of my limbs
comes between Sadie and a clean exit.

704
00:52:45.749 --> 00:52:48.919
Sure. Sadie survivors
have to look after each other. right?

705
00:52:48.919 --> 00:52:50.003
Thank you.

706
00:52:50.003 --> 00:52:51.505
Honestly. thank you so much.

707
00:52:51.505 --> 00:52:52.673
You're welcome. babe. Kiss?

708
00:52:52.673 --> 00:52:53.757
No.

709
00:52:54.883 --> 00:52:56.051
No.

710
00:52:56.051 --> 00:52:57.302
Goodbye. Cole.

711
00:52:59.888 --> 00:53:01.807
I'm glad that you survived.

712
00:53:07.396 --> 00:53:09.147
I just wanna be very clear.

713
00:53:09.147 --> 00:53:12.025
Do not ever contact me again.

714
00:53:12.025 --> 00:53:14.778
- Okay?
- With pleasure.

715
00:53:15.529 --> 00:53:17.447
I've already forgotten your name.

716
00:53:17.447 --> 00:53:19.616
Which I'm sure by the way
is fake anyway. so...

717
00:53:24.162 --> 00:53:26.331
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it.

718
00:53:26.999 --> 00:53:29.960
She went for a normie.
but that's just lying to herself.

719
00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.420
- Yeah.
- Anyway. cheer up. mate.

720
00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.464
Stop staring at her. Stop crying.
You're safe now. Come on.

721
00:53:34.464 --> 00:53:36.341
We got a cheeky bottle-o in the back.

722
00:53:36.341 --> 00:53:38.886
On the piss. you and me get drunk.
get smashed.

723
00:53:38.886 --> 00:53:40.012
Alcohol in your mouth.

724
00:53:40.012 --> 00:53:42.556
This is my town. Nothing happens here
that I don't see coming a mile away.

725
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.935
Everything but that I guess.

726
00:53:51.773 --> 00:53:54.067
Walk. Both of you.

727
00:53:57.362 --> 00:54:00.032
- Sorry about Marco.
- Stop talking before you get us killed.

728
00:54:00.032 --> 00:54:02.117
Don't worry. They want him alive.

729
00:54:02.117 --> 00:54:05.162
I don't know what your deal is.
but I'm sure they'll pay for you too.

730
00:54:05.162 --> 00:54:08.415
- They definitely will.
- Cole. shut up. Just--

731
00:54:08.916 --> 00:54:10.459
I'm trying to keep you alive.

732
00:54:10.459 --> 00:54:12.169
Would you rather I say
they wouldn't pay for you?

733
00:54:12.169 --> 00:54:14.004
This is so cute. Get a room.

734
00:54:14.004 --> 00:54:16.507
If it means anything. he's not the Taxman.

735
00:54:17.007 --> 00:54:19.968
Yeah. and I'm not the Grandson of Sam.

736
00:54:19.968 --> 00:54:23.680
Huh? Like the Son of Sam.
the serial killer. but next gen.

737
00:54:24.431 --> 00:54:25.891
I'm the best bounty hunter alive.

738
00:54:31.271 --> 00:54:32.356
Second best.

739
00:54:32.856 --> 00:54:34.316
That was very impressive.

740
00:54:37.653 --> 00:54:40.030
- Shall we?
- Yep. yep. Yep.

741
00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.909
You disappointed me. Taxman.
That was too easy.

742
00:54:43.909 --> 00:54:46.078
Now your lady friend's gonna die
'cause of you.

743
00:54:46.078 --> 00:54:48.747
That's funny.
Usually the other way around.

744
00:54:48.747 --> 00:54:50.249
It was you who followed me to Europe.

745
00:54:50.249 --> 00:54:51.875
Lured by your lying.

746
00:54:51.875 --> 00:54:53.669
God. you two need to get a room.

747
00:54:53.669 --> 00:54:56.088
We did. That's what got us into this mess.

748
00:54:56.088 --> 00:54:57.464
Okay. get in the car.

749
00:55:00.384 --> 00:55:02.886
Lady drives. Taxman. you're riding middle.

750
00:55:06.056 --> 00:55:07.432
Scooch. scooch.

751
00:55:09.226 --> 00:55:11.186
Well. Taxman it up.

752
00:55:11.186 --> 00:55:12.813
Don't use Taxman as a verb.

753
00:55:14.982 --> 00:55:16.525
You mind telling us who you are?

754
00:55:17.943 --> 00:55:19.403
They call me the Leopard.

755
00:55:21.363 --> 00:55:22.823
Oh. my God.

756
00:55:22.823 --> 00:55:24.408
Called him the Leopard.

757
00:55:24.408 --> 00:55:27.744
But even leopards get killed by lions.

758
00:55:27.744 --> 00:55:30.289
hyenas. lightning.

759
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:32.749
Get him out.

760
00:55:38.547 --> 00:55:39.715
And drive.

761
00:55:45.262 --> 00:55:46.263
And who are you?

762
00:55:49.766 --> 00:55:51.727
God. The Bounty Hunter.

763
00:55:52.519 --> 00:55:55.689
Wow. You guys have really good names
in your world.

764
00:55:55.689 --> 00:55:59.193
It's like the WWE. but scarier.

765
00:56:03.155 --> 00:56:07.075
One twist of this ring will send
50.000 volts through your sorry ass.

766
00:56:08.368 --> 00:56:11.330
- Make you wish you were dead.
- Too late.

767
00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:13.957
This is great. Thank you for this.

768
00:56:13.957 --> 00:56:16.251
- Huh?
- No. I was just thinking how happy I am

769
00:56:16.251 --> 00:56:18.795
to have an electrified hockey puck
stuck to my neck with what.

770
00:56:18.795 --> 00:56:20.964
- 50.000 volts ready to go into--
- I can't take this.

771
00:56:20.964 --> 00:56:22.633
- Volts into my--
- You really need to shut up.

772
00:56:22.633 --> 00:56:23.550
Wow.

773
00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:25.511
You two should get a room.

774
00:56:27.387 --> 00:56:28.847
You know what? Stop.

775
00:56:28.847 --> 00:56:30.098
Pull over here.

776
00:56:30.098 --> 00:56:31.225
My car is better.

777
00:56:40.692 --> 00:56:42.778
Look. I don't mean to
shake your confidence. God.

778
00:56:42.778 --> 00:56:44.404
but the last two guys didn't make it.

779
00:56:44.404 --> 00:56:45.906
My confidence doesn't shake.

780
00:56:46.532 --> 00:56:50.077
I spent years conditioning myself
to attuning my sense--

781
00:56:55.624 --> 00:56:58.085
Got you. suckers.

782
00:57:11.974 --> 00:57:15.477
If you're collecting the bounty.
where are they taking delivery?

783
00:57:24.486 --> 00:57:27.406
Listen. I'll stash you someplace safe.

784
00:57:27.406 --> 00:57:30.784
If I don't come back for you.
an extraction team will.

785
00:57:30.784 --> 00:57:34.413
So you're really gonna raid a plane
full of armed goons by yourself?

786
00:57:34.413 --> 00:57:37.791
I have to find Aztec. It's my only play.

787
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:39.751
Wow.

788
00:57:45.841 --> 00:57:49.720
Well. for what it's worth.
I'm sorry about Marco.

789
00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:51.346
God. Seriously?

790
00:57:52.181 --> 00:57:55.517
You know. I'm trying to connect
about a person that just died.

791
00:57:55.517 --> 00:57:57.227
Someone you knew well.

792
00:57:57.227 --> 00:57:59.521
Are you capable of that.
or is that only on first dates?

793
00:57:59.521 --> 00:58:03.317
The rest of the time. it's just
chemical weapons and passcodes

794
00:58:03.317 --> 00:58:04.818
and bullets and death.

795
00:58:04.818 --> 00:58:07.613
Wait. what passcodes?
What do you mean about passcodes?

796
00:58:07.613 --> 00:58:12.409
The bug guy in the cave
kept asking me about passcodes.

797
00:58:13.202 --> 00:58:14.494
Jesus!

798
00:58:16.121 --> 00:58:18.498
- He thinks I have the passcode?
- Yeah.

799
00:58:18.498 --> 00:58:20.167
And you're telling me this now?

800
00:58:20.167 --> 00:58:21.460
I'm sorry.

801
00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.046
I was slightly drugged and kidnapped
at the time.

802
00:58:24.046 --> 00:58:24.963
Unbelievable.

803
00:58:24.963 --> 00:58:27.674
Also. in case you forgot. I'm a farmer.

804
00:58:27.674 --> 00:58:29.426
I'm not a super spy.

805
00:58:29.426 --> 00:58:32.971
Why didn't you just ask me
what the torturer was torturing me about?

806
00:58:32.971 --> 00:58:34.348
You are unbelievable!

807
00:58:34.348 --> 00:58:36.141
What? What?

808
00:58:36.141 --> 00:58:37.935
What are the passcodes?

809
00:58:37.935 --> 00:58:40.854
The least you could do is tell me
what I almost died for.

810
00:58:43.815 --> 00:58:48.570
Aztec is inside a high-security case
that cannot be opened without a passcode.

811
00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:50.989
Elena figured out the DNA encryption.

812
00:58:50.989 --> 00:58:52.366
What do you mean. DNA encryption?

813
00:58:52.366 --> 00:58:55.953
The passcode is the entire genetic
sequence of a living organism.

814
00:58:55.953 --> 00:58:58.705
- Insanely long and unique.
- Wow.

815
00:58:58.705 --> 00:59:01.291
I got to Elena
before she could upload it to Leveque.

816
00:59:01.291 --> 00:59:03.043
So they think you have the passcode?

817
00:59:03.043 --> 00:59:06.004
But I don't because she destroyed it.

818
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:10.175
But if Leveque
is trying to get it from me.

819
00:59:10.175 --> 00:59:12.135
that means he doesn't have it either.

820
00:59:12.636 --> 00:59:15.138
Which means he can't
hand the weapon over to his buyers.

821
00:59:15.138 --> 00:59:17.641
- Which means--
- He still has Aztec.

822
00:59:17.641 --> 00:59:20.018
Which means change of plans.

823
00:59:20.018 --> 00:59:21.353
Do you trust me?

824
00:59:21.353 --> 00:59:23.188
Is that a fucking joke?

825
00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:25.274
Thank you for your honesty.

826
00:59:38.453 --> 00:59:40.372
You're a f-- I cannot believe--

827
00:59:40.372 --> 00:59:43.125
<i>'Cause I'm the taxman</i>

828
00:59:44.793 --> 00:59:48.881
<i>Yeah. I'm the taxman</i>

829
00:59:50.465 --> 00:59:53.427
- Get it?
- The song? Very funny.

830
00:59:53.427 --> 00:59:56.513
You left an impressive trail of blood
bringing us our friend.

831
00:59:57.931 --> 01:00:00.184
- Well done.
- Thanks.

832
01:00:00.184 --> 01:00:01.810
But I don't get paid in compliments.

833
01:00:04.104 --> 01:00:06.523
You'll get your money. bounty hunter.

834
01:00:14.531 --> 01:00:16.158
So you're the Taxman.

835
01:00:16.992 --> 01:00:19.244
CIA's golden boy.

836
01:00:21.371 --> 01:00:25.083
Your pseudonym has generated
as much fun as you have.

837
01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:26.960
But I know you.

838
01:00:31.632 --> 01:00:34.176
I know you because I was you.

839
01:00:35.302 --> 01:00:36.803
Disposable.

840
01:00:37.471 --> 01:00:41.266
Except one day. I found myself

841
01:00:42.392 --> 01:00:46.396
bleeding out in a ditch
on the edge of Kabul.

842
01:00:51.693 --> 01:00:53.987
There was trash everywhere.

843
01:00:54.696 --> 01:00:58.408
And then suddenly. I got clarity.

844
01:01:00.077 --> 01:01:02.204
I had given them everything

845
01:01:03.455 --> 01:01:05.666
and sacrificed everything.

846
01:01:07.417 --> 01:01:09.837
It is a waste of life.

847
01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:13.257
And what are we?

848
01:01:15.884 --> 01:01:17.094
Instruments.

849
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.097
Expendable.

850
01:01:21.306 --> 01:01:23.350
We deserve better.

851
01:01:35.153 --> 01:01:39.408
Tell me the passcode and walk away.

852
01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:42.870
If you don't...

853
01:01:44.037 --> 01:01:46.206
well. we both know how that will go.

854
01:01:46.874 --> 01:01:48.458
I will get what I want...

855
01:01:50.627 --> 01:01:52.504
and you will die anyway.

856
01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:54.965
For nothing.

857
01:01:58.677 --> 01:02:00.512
I swear to God.
I don't know what the passcode is.

858
01:02:00.512 --> 01:02:01.805
I'm not even the Taxman.

859
01:02:02.598 --> 01:02:03.473
Shut up.

860
01:02:06.185 --> 01:02:07.311
Can we get back to business?

861
01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.771
Is that my money?

862
01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:15.611
Your payment will be wired soon.

863
01:02:15.611 --> 01:02:18.447
Rumor has it
you stole a weapon you can't use.

864
01:02:18.447 --> 01:02:20.157
so you're overextended.

865
01:02:20.157 --> 01:02:23.410
And now you want me to work on what?
Credit?

866
01:02:23.410 --> 01:02:25.329
No. no.

867
01:02:25.329 --> 01:02:26.413
Cash.

868
01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:30.417
And until I get it.
he doesn't leave my sight.

869
01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:32.294
Or we just kill you.

870
01:02:35.339 --> 01:02:38.675
And make your boss
the guy who offers big paydays

871
01:02:38.675 --> 01:02:40.344
and kills anyone who delivers?

872
01:02:41.386 --> 01:02:42.888
Let me guess.

873
01:02:42.888 --> 01:02:45.766
This is the idiot
who lost him to begin with.

874
01:02:45.766 --> 01:02:48.101
You'll get your cash when you land.

875
01:02:52.064 --> 01:02:53.106
She called you an idiot.

876
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:54.566
Yeah.

877
01:02:54.566 --> 01:02:55.943
To your face.

878
01:02:56.902 --> 01:02:59.571
Kill her when you touch down.

879
01:03:01.031 --> 01:03:02.866
Get that passcode.

880
01:03:03.742 --> 01:03:06.078
I expect that to be open
next time I see you.

881
01:03:06.078 --> 01:03:07.162
You're not coming?

882
01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:12.918
If anything should go wrong
when you open that case...

883
01:03:16.463 --> 01:03:18.549
...everyone on board dies.

884
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:19.800
No pressure.

885
01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.261
Yes. sir.

886
01:03:37.359 --> 01:03:39.695
We're looking for a genetic sequence.

887
01:03:40.737 --> 01:03:42.197
Do you know what "genetic" means?

888
01:03:51.206 --> 01:03:52.416
That's a cactus.

889
01:03:55.502 --> 01:03:56.753
Thirsty?

890
01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:09.766
- Be smart.
- Sociopath.

891
01:04:09.766 --> 01:04:11.476
I'm not a sociopath.

892
01:04:11.476 --> 01:04:13.812
You know who says that a lot? Sociopaths.

893
01:04:19.401 --> 01:04:23.405
I have dated some crazies in my day.
but you are certifiable.

894
01:04:23.405 --> 01:04:25.741
This is bigger than you and me.

895
01:04:26.533 --> 01:04:28.035
And my plan worked.

896
01:04:28.744 --> 01:04:29.745
Better than I imagined.

897
01:04:29.745 --> 01:04:30.829
Really?

898
01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:33.373
Did you imagine
I'd make it out of this alive?

899
01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:34.833
We found Aztec.

900
01:04:39.213 --> 01:04:41.757
As soon as we land.
we'll take these guys down.

901
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:43.592
We'll be safe.

902
01:04:43.592 --> 01:04:45.886
The world will be safe. Everybody wins.

903
01:04:53.936 --> 01:04:55.312
What's all this?

904
01:04:55.312 --> 01:04:56.396
What's...

905
01:04:58.315 --> 01:04:59.316
all this?

906
01:05:06.532 --> 01:05:08.617
I would expect more discretion

907
01:05:10.118 --> 01:05:11.161
from the Taxman.

908
01:05:11.954 --> 01:05:13.205
So would I.

909
01:05:14.873 --> 01:05:16.375
So what are you really?

910
01:05:17.334 --> 01:05:18.710
Hired help?

911
01:05:19.878 --> 01:05:20.712
Or just the girlfriend?

912
01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:23.006
Believe me. she's not girlfriend material.

913
01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:24.132
You know. I don't care.

914
01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:26.969
You die either way.

915
01:05:28.053 --> 01:05:29.847
Hey. hey. hey. Wait. wait. Wait.

916
01:05:30.931 --> 01:05:32.641
Who's the idiot now?

917
01:05:32.641 --> 01:05:34.059
I have the passcode.

918
01:05:35.519 --> 01:05:37.145
Bullshit.

919
01:05:37.896 --> 01:05:38.897
He doesn't have it.

920
01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:40.482
I do.

921
01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:42.985
Really?

922
01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:44.903
So we can kill him.

923
01:05:46.822 --> 01:05:48.907
Hey! Wait. Okay. Wait.

924
01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:50.826
The passcode. Now!

925
01:05:52.327 --> 01:05:54.413
Sure. It's in my pocket.

926
01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:59.042
We're good.

927
01:06:05.716 --> 01:06:06.800
Really?

928
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.885
Open it.

929
01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:39.333
Shit!

930
01:06:45.339 --> 01:06:48.008
I can't believe you took a picture of me
while I was sleeping!

931
01:06:48.008 --> 01:06:49.468
Not of you. of us!

932
01:06:49.468 --> 01:06:50.928
I knew you were a creep!

933
01:06:55.224 --> 01:06:56.225
I'm not a creep!

934
01:06:56.225 --> 01:06:58.393
You know who says that a lot? Creeps!

935
01:08:07.045 --> 01:08:08.797
Let me see. Let me see. Let me see.

936
01:08:09.965 --> 01:08:11.133
Oh. my God.

937
01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:12.801
Take the case and go.

938
01:08:14.595 --> 01:08:17.055
- There is a parachute.
- What about you?

939
01:08:17.055 --> 01:08:18.807
Mission over man.

940
01:08:18.807 --> 01:08:22.060
No. No. I gotta stop this bleeding first.
You're losing a lot of blood.

941
01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.187
- Just go. Cole.
- I gotta find...

942
01:08:23.187 --> 01:08:25.022
- Cole. go! Go!
- Sadie. I'm telling you right--

943
01:08:26.982 --> 01:08:28.024
Get out of here.

944
01:08:35.282 --> 01:08:36.200
Hey!

945
01:08:44.082 --> 01:08:45.959
Get out of the way. you idiot.

946
01:08:48.545 --> 01:08:49.462
What are you doing?

947
01:08:49.462 --> 01:08:50.631
I have no idea.

948
01:09:19.535 --> 01:09:20.661
Sadie?

949
01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:23.663
God.

950
01:09:28.502 --> 01:09:29.670
I told you to go.

951
01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:33.631
I did.

952
01:09:34.131 --> 01:09:35.509
I just took you with me.

953
01:09:36.093 --> 01:09:37.219
How long was I out?

954
01:09:37.219 --> 01:09:38.595
A while.

955
01:09:40.264 --> 01:09:42.558
Looks like you got creative
with the parachute.

956
01:09:44.434 --> 01:09:45.644
I had a lot of nervous energy.

957
01:09:53.234 --> 01:09:54.236
You got it.

958
01:09:54.903 --> 01:09:55.988
Yeah. Yeah.

959
01:09:56.488 --> 01:09:57.739
You got it.

960
01:09:57.739 --> 01:09:59.741
- You got Aztec.
- Yeah.

961
01:10:01.451 --> 01:10:03.120
- Wait. Take it easy.
- I mean. do you have a--

962
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.663
You lost a lot of blood.

963
01:10:07.165 --> 01:10:08.166
It was really gross.

964
01:10:10.252 --> 01:10:12.045
I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.

965
01:10:13.755 --> 01:10:14.756
Thank you.

966
01:10:15.507 --> 01:10:16.508
You're welcome.

967
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:39.531
Pardon me. Excuse me. Pardon.

968
01:10:41.116 --> 01:10:42.201
Hello?

969
01:10:42.201 --> 01:10:44.077
<i>Leveque. things didn't go as planned.</i>

970
01:10:44.995 --> 01:10:46.496
The girl sprung the Taxman.

971
01:10:46.496 --> 01:10:48.999
How many times can you lose one man?

972
01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:51.210
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

973
01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:54.379
If we do not deliver
an operational weapon in 48 hours.

974
01:10:54.379 --> 01:10:55.881
our buyers will kill us all.

975
01:10:56.673 --> 01:10:58.300
Now. you find the Taxman.

976
01:10:59.384 --> 01:11:03.347
or they will not have the chance
because I will kill you myself.

977
01:11:07.059 --> 01:11:09.353
Boss. We have a sighting of the parachute.

978
01:11:11.188 --> 01:11:12.356
Good.

979
01:11:22.533 --> 01:11:25.327
You know.
I think. depending on your strength.

980
01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:28.372
we should consider maybe hiking
out of here tomorrow.

981
01:11:28.956 --> 01:11:30.207
Depending on your strength.

982
01:11:33.919 --> 01:11:36.547
You have to tell me. What is this gunk?

983
01:11:37.339 --> 01:11:39.675
It's periwinkle and gavilana.

984
01:11:39.675 --> 01:11:42.261
I found it up the beach.
smashed it up and put it in there

985
01:11:42.261 --> 01:11:44.763
to stop the bleeding
and fight the infection.

986
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:48.058
- How did you know how to do that?
- I read about it.

987
01:11:49.059 --> 01:11:52.729
Throughout history. every culture has
their own knowledge of the crops they grow

988
01:11:53.272 --> 01:11:55.732
for food or clothing. medicine.

989
01:11:57.401 --> 01:12:00.529
I just don't get why you never left
the country.

990
01:12:01.613 --> 01:12:03.031
- Here we go.
- What? I'm serious.

991
01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:05.117
You're clearly interested in the world.

992
01:12:05.117 --> 01:12:10.205
I wanted to travel. I really did.
I thought I was gonna after I graduated.

993
01:12:10.205 --> 01:12:12.624
You know. research the book.
Then my dad got hurt...

994
01:12:15.752 --> 01:12:16.753
just went home.

995
01:12:18.589 --> 01:12:19.882
He never recovered?

996
01:12:20.674 --> 01:12:22.342
No. he did. He's good now.

997
01:12:22.342 --> 01:12:24.720
But you know. he's getting old.

998
01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.848
And you know.
we got to keep production high to compete.

999
01:12:27.848 --> 01:12:29.766
and business is changing.

1000
01:12:29.766 --> 01:12:30.851
Anyway...

1001
01:12:32.519 --> 01:12:33.562
They need me there.

1002
01:12:34.646 --> 01:12:35.647
Do they?

1003
01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.654
What about you? Your mom must be proud.

1004
01:12:42.654 --> 01:12:45.490
Daughter's a CIA agent. Right?

1005
01:12:47.951 --> 01:12:49.328
I'd like to think she'd be.

1006
01:12:52.664 --> 01:12:54.583
My mom died when I was very young.

1007
01:12:55.459 --> 01:12:58.170
- God. I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- It's okay.

1008
01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:01.298
I promise. It happened so long ago.

1009
01:13:02.216 --> 01:13:06.011
You know. and then after she died.
I found the army.

1010
01:13:06.512 --> 01:13:10.390
You know.
somewhere where I could put my focus.

1011
01:13:10.974 --> 01:13:14.645
And then the agency. they gave me purpose.

1012
01:13:17.481 --> 01:13:21.276
Our struggles make us stronger. Right?

1013
01:13:23.403 --> 01:13:24.571
Any other family?

1014
01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:29.409
In my line of work.
it's better being alone.

1015
01:13:30.786 --> 01:13:31.787
Is it?

1016
01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:40.754
For what it's worth. I think
that any parent would be very proud...

1017
01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:43.340
of you.

1018
01:13:47.427 --> 01:13:48.554
You know what?

1019
01:13:48.554 --> 01:13:52.599
I just can't believe that that little shit
is still in one piece.

1020
01:13:53.433 --> 01:13:55.727
Maybe you can keep
a cactus alive after all.

1021
01:13:56.979 --> 01:13:57.980
Maybe.

1022
01:14:09.324 --> 01:14:10.742
I'm sorry about the selfie.

1023
01:14:11.451 --> 01:14:13.078
I'm sorry about the gag.

1024
01:14:13.078 --> 01:14:14.538
Call it even?

1025
01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:15.622
Deal.

1026
01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:00.709
Run!

1027
01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:06.840
Get me the Taxman alive. kill the girl.
and I'll get Aztec.

1028
01:15:18.602 --> 01:15:19.728
Move! Move!

1029
01:15:21.688 --> 01:15:22.814
There she is.

1030
01:15:32.157 --> 01:15:34.743
<i>Attention.
This is the United States Marines.</i>

1031
01:15:34.743 --> 01:15:38.205
<i>Safety your weapons
and drop them on the ground.</i>

1032
01:15:54.304 --> 01:15:55.639
Damn it.

1033
01:16:23.876 --> 01:16:25.127
Where's the case?

1034
01:16:30.716 --> 01:16:33.927
Agent Rhodes. It's time to go home.

1035
01:16:35.679 --> 01:16:37.598
We're fine. Thanks.

1036
01:16:39.183 --> 01:16:40.309
Let's go.

1037
01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:51.445
- That's not too tight on you now. is it?
- No.

1038
01:16:51.445 --> 01:16:53.280
Okay. Just wanna make sure.

1039
01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.406
Yeah. that's good.

1040
01:16:56.617 --> 01:16:58.452
A polygraph. Jackson?

1041
01:16:58.452 --> 01:17:01.246
Are you really
this desperate to jump ahead of me?

1042
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.875
I'm just doing my job. Rhodes.

1043
01:17:04.875 --> 01:17:08.337
No. if you were doing your job.
you'd be out there looking for Aztec.

1044
01:17:08.337 --> 01:17:10.380
If you had done yours.
we never would have lost it.

1045
01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:13.467
Well. it wasn't her fault.
She was just trying to save me.

1046
01:17:16.261 --> 01:17:17.387
Of course.

1047
01:17:18.347 --> 01:17:20.891
The boyfriend.
accidentally along for the ride.

1048
01:17:20.891 --> 01:17:23.435
Didn't it ever occur to you
that he could be a foreign asset.

1049
01:17:23.435 --> 01:17:24.770
trying to compromise your mission?

1050
01:17:25.687 --> 01:17:31.109
Yeah. Six-foot honeypot sent to kiss
and nibble the secrets right out of you.

1051
01:17:31.109 --> 01:17:33.612
Patti. just watch the machine. please.

1052
01:17:33.612 --> 01:17:35.447
Right. Sorry.

1053
01:17:35.447 --> 01:17:40.160
We both know you checked him out.
He's a civilian. and he's clean.

1054
01:17:41.328 --> 01:17:42.746
{\an8}Some civilian.

1055
01:17:42.746 --> 01:17:47.584
Because you chose his life over thousands.
if Aztec is ever deployed.

1056
01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:50.045
I let my emotions cloud my judgment.

1057
01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:53.173
Wait a minute.

1058
01:17:55.843 --> 01:18:00.055
{\an8}Are you saying you think
it was a mistake to save my life?

1059
01:18:02.808 --> 01:18:03.725
Yes.

1060
01:18:10.732 --> 01:18:11.733
That's great.

1061
01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:14.236
That's great.

1062
01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:18.782
Cole. I'm sorry. but they're right.
One life compared to thousands.

1063
01:18:18.782 --> 01:18:21.535
Yeah. no. I get it.
Mission over man justifies everything.

1064
01:18:21.535 --> 01:18:23.954
Marco's hand.
using me as bait at the airstrip.

1065
01:18:23.954 --> 01:18:25.581
- I get it.
- You used him as bait?

1066
01:18:25.581 --> 01:18:26.498
- Yes.
- No.

1067
01:18:26.498 --> 01:18:27.958
Well...

1068
01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:30.711
Marco was right about you.
You should date someone just like him.

1069
01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:33.255
Completely cut off
from emotional connection

1070
01:18:33.255 --> 01:18:34.756
- and not afraid to lose a limb.
- What?

1071
01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.759
You know what?
Marco was right. but not about that.

1072
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:42.306
We only have one life.
and you are too afraid to live it.

1073
01:18:42.306 --> 01:18:43.599
Says the one-handed dead guy.

1074
01:18:43.599 --> 01:18:44.725
What's happening?

1075
01:18:44.725 --> 01:18:46.894
Cole. you went to your parents' house
to help them.

1076
01:18:46.894 --> 01:18:48.896
But I don't think they need you anymore.

1077
01:18:48.896 --> 01:18:50.981
I think
they're just an excuse to avoid life.

1078
01:18:50.981 --> 01:18:52.191
Look who's talking.

1079
01:18:52.191 --> 01:18:56.862
Your job. the duty. the sacrifice.
that's your excuse to keep people out.

1080
01:18:56.862 --> 01:18:58.572
I think you're afraid
to get close to people.

1081
01:18:58.572 --> 01:18:59.948
'Cause if you do. you might lose them.

1082
01:18:59.948 --> 01:19:01.325
- Just like you lost your mother.
- Hey!

1083
01:19:02.367 --> 01:19:04.828
You don't talk about her!

1084
01:19:08.999 --> 01:19:10.751
And I'm not afraid of anything.

1085
01:19:13.212 --> 01:19:15.130
You two need to get a room.

1086
01:19:16.215 --> 01:19:17.382
- Oh. my God.
- Patti.

1087
01:19:17.382 --> 01:19:18.800
he's not even hooked up to the machine.

1088
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.638
I'm sorry. But. you guys.
the sexual tension in the room is just--

1089
01:19:22.638 --> 01:19:23.972
The boss wants to see you.

1090
01:19:31.813 --> 01:19:33.774
So much for starting with a houseplant.

1091
01:19:37.027 --> 01:19:38.820
I know she pulled you into this...

1092
01:19:41.198 --> 01:19:42.074
but...

1093
01:19:44.952 --> 01:19:46.203
you're still in deep shit.

1094
01:19:46.995 --> 01:19:48.413
You're facing prosecution.

1095
01:19:48.413 --> 01:19:50.999
For what? Visiting a girl in London?

1096
01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:52.334
Why are you protecting her?

1097
01:19:52.334 --> 01:19:55.963
I know this looks bad. I can fix it.

1098
01:19:55.963 --> 01:19:57.422
We can still get Leveque.

1099
01:19:57.422 --> 01:20:00.300
You were always my favorite. Sadie.

1100
01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:03.387
But you going rogue.
there's nothing I can do.

1101
01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:04.888
What do you mean?

1102
01:20:04.888 --> 01:20:07.391
She didn't lose Aztec. did she?

1103
01:20:07.391 --> 01:20:09.810
No. no. no. no. no.
She's working an angle.

1104
01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:11.603
- No. No.
- Looking to cash in.

1105
01:20:13.605 --> 01:20:14.940
Sadie would never do that.

1106
01:20:17.317 --> 01:20:20.445
You let Aztec
get into the hands of a known threat.

1107
01:20:20.445 --> 01:20:22.781
You're suspended.
pending a full investigation.

1108
01:20:22.781 --> 01:20:24.700
but you know how these things go.

1109
01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.911
You'll be lucky to have a job
at all when it's done.

1110
01:20:30.664 --> 01:20:32.416
Look at what she does.

1111
01:20:32.416 --> 01:20:34.251
And this is just the last six months.

1112
01:20:34.251 --> 01:20:36.587
She's a liar and a killer. Cole.

1113
01:20:37.421 --> 01:20:38.922
Is that someone you want to protect?

1114
01:20:41.508 --> 01:20:42.801
Take home to Mom?

1115
01:20:48.724 --> 01:20:49.975
Oh. my God.

1116
01:20:53.645 --> 01:20:56.648
What am I looking at? A houseplant?

1117
01:20:56.648 --> 01:20:59.860
Well. it's not a houseplant.
That's an amaranth. A crop.

1118
01:21:01.904 --> 01:21:05.073
Farmed in the Americas
for thousands of years. mostly for food.

1119
01:21:05.073 --> 01:21:08.452
but often used in rituals by the Aztecs.

1120
01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:14.541
Oh. my God. The plant wasn't hers.
She took it from Horvath. the scientist.

1121
01:21:14.541 --> 01:21:17.628
He was obsessed with the Aztecs' use
of human sacrifice.

1122
01:21:18.545 --> 01:21:21.548
{\an8}The genetic sequence
of that amaranth is the passcode.

1123
01:21:21.548 --> 01:21:23.091
I'll be damned.

1124
01:21:23.091 --> 01:21:26.261
I want that plant retrieved
from Elena's apartment now.

1125
01:21:27.095 --> 01:21:30.766
You know. we can use this to lure
in Leveque. We get a message to him.

1126
01:21:30.766 --> 01:21:33.727
"The Taxman is ready
to sell the passcode."

1127
01:21:33.727 --> 01:21:34.853
He'll never go for it.

1128
01:21:34.853 --> 01:21:36.897
Unless we bait the hook.

1129
01:21:38.065 --> 01:21:40.651
The passcode is divided
into four segments.

1130
01:21:40.651 --> 01:21:42.069
Send Leveque the first.

1131
01:21:42.069 --> 01:21:45.572
What? Give him part of the key?
That's insane.

1132
01:21:45.572 --> 01:21:48.659
Exactly. The agency would never allow it.

1133
01:21:49.326 --> 01:21:53.830
So if the Taxman is doing it. that means
he went rogue and the offer is real.

1134
01:21:55.457 --> 01:21:57.459
Leveque is desperate. He'll bite.

1135
01:22:00.170 --> 01:22:03.674
That means we're gonna need the Taxman.

1136
01:22:07.177 --> 01:22:11.265
Me? No. no. no way.

1137
01:22:11.265 --> 01:22:13.600
It's only for appearances.
He won't even get near you.

1138
01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:17.312
Well. then what do you need me for?
Use a dummy. Put Jackson in a disguise.

1139
01:22:17.312 --> 01:22:18.564
That's a great idea.

1140
01:22:18.564 --> 01:22:22.526
Mr. Turner. I know you don't want
to do this. but I also know that you will.

1141
01:22:22.526 --> 01:22:25.946
As long as Leveque thinks
you're the Taxman. you're in danger.

1142
01:22:25.946 --> 01:22:29.783
Well. then put me in protective custody.
Hide me just until you find the guy.

1143
01:22:29.783 --> 01:22:31.201
What about your family?

1144
01:22:32.995 --> 01:22:36.373
- What about my family?
- Guys like Leveque. they never stop.

1145
01:22:36.957 --> 01:22:39.501
The only way
to guarantee your family's safety

1146
01:22:39.501 --> 01:22:41.128
is to take him off the board.

1147
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:45.632
No. no. no.

1148
01:22:46.216 --> 01:22:50.554
Hey. Cole. Cole. it's too dangerous.

1149
01:22:51.847 --> 01:22:53.015
They're using you.

1150
01:22:53.682 --> 01:22:56.560
Well. that's funny because he just said
the same thing about you.

1151
01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.521
Remind me. which one of you
can't stop risking my life?

1152
01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:02.858
I know you're angry.
but this is a mistake.

1153
01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:06.486
Protecting the people you love
is never a mistake.

1154
01:23:08.113 --> 01:23:10.991
Maybe one day you'll care enough
about someone to understand that.

1155
01:23:13.702 --> 01:23:14.828
Rhodes.

1156
01:23:23.212 --> 01:23:25.172
Come on. you have to let me run this.

1157
01:23:25.756 --> 01:23:27.841
I know more about Leveque's operation
than anyone.

1158
01:23:27.841 --> 01:23:30.677
Go home. Sadie. And stay there.

1159
01:23:49.154 --> 01:23:50.155
{\an8}What do you think?

1160
01:23:50.155 --> 01:23:52.491
What do I think? I think it is a trap.

1161
01:23:54.368 --> 01:23:55.369
Test it.

1162
01:24:10.634 --> 01:24:11.635
It's genuine.

1163
01:24:13.345 --> 01:24:14.471
Maybe it's not a trap.

1164
01:24:14.471 --> 01:24:19.393
Or maybe it is just a very good one.
Either way. what choice do we have?

1165
01:24:20.185 --> 01:24:21.186
Boss.

1166
01:24:25.566 --> 01:24:28.986
Mr. Utami. Pleasure to see you again.

1167
01:24:28.986 --> 01:24:31.405
Funny. When you accepted my first payment.

1168
01:24:31.405 --> 01:24:33.949
you neglected to mention
that you didn't have the passcode.

1169
01:24:33.949 --> 01:24:38.078
We will have it soon.
Aztec will be yours as promised.

1170
01:24:47.129 --> 01:24:48.255
Mine. I believe.

1171
01:24:50.215 --> 01:24:51.508
You're meeting the Taxman?

1172
01:24:52.968 --> 01:24:54.094
We'll go together.

1173
01:24:55.804 --> 01:25:01.602
If he has the passcode. we conclude
our business. If he doesn't. I kill you.

1174
01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:12.821
Mr. Utami. one condition.

1175
01:25:13.822 --> 01:25:16.450
Whatever happens. the Taxman dies.

1176
01:25:17.451 --> 01:25:18.535
So be it.

1177
01:25:58.659 --> 01:26:00.702
<i>Turner.
get in there and make it look good.</i>

1178
01:26:00.702 --> 01:26:02.788
<i>You'll be in and out in 20 minutes.</i>

1179
01:26:07.751 --> 01:26:10.921
Stop messing with your collar. Sounds
like a goddamn thunderstorm in here.

1180
01:26:10.921 --> 01:26:13.799
Sorry. I hate suits.

1181
01:26:28.647 --> 01:26:31.650
- How many guys do you have?
- Including me? Three.

1182
01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:36.071
Three? What do you mean? Three guys total?

1183
01:26:36.071 --> 01:26:38.282
You have three guys total?
You can't do this with three guys.

1184
01:26:38.282 --> 01:26:41.827
The CIA can't operate on US soil.
We had to travel light.

1185
01:26:41.827 --> 01:26:46.039
Travel light?
What are you. backpacking through Europe?

1186
01:26:46.039 --> 01:26:49.334
You're the CIA. What does that even mean?
Travel light?

1187
01:26:49.334 --> 01:26:52.629
<i>Calm down. Leveque's men
just need to see you in there.</i>

1188
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:54.381
<i>We'll arrest him as soon as he shows.</i>

1189
01:26:54.381 --> 01:26:55.799
You got to play the part.

1190
01:26:55.799 --> 01:27:00.387
<i>You're not a farmer anymore. Remember?
You're the Taxman. Now. get in there.</i>

1191
01:27:12.941 --> 01:27:14.276
Hi. welcome in.

1192
01:27:14.276 --> 01:27:15.861
Table for Mr. Taxman.

1193
01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:17.237
Yes. right this way.

1194
01:27:34.505 --> 01:27:35.756
Cheers!

1195
01:27:52.397 --> 01:27:55.067
<i>Everything will be fine.
We've got it all under control.</i>

1196
01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:56.985
and the bad guys will never get near you.

1197
01:27:56.985 --> 01:27:58.695
Three guys.

1198
01:28:16.672 --> 01:28:17.965
They're here.

1199
01:28:28.642 --> 01:28:31.520
<i>We got eyes on the target.
He has the weapon.</i>

1200
01:28:32.688 --> 01:28:33.939
Let's get ready to move.

1201
01:28:40.904 --> 01:28:42.531
Jackson. What was that?

1202
01:28:43.866 --> 01:28:45.868
- <i>Cole.</i>
- What?

1203
01:28:45.868 --> 01:28:47.077
Get out of there.

1204
01:28:47.077 --> 01:28:50.914
Go now? Okay. Okay. Okay.

1205
01:28:50.914 --> 01:28:52.749
<i>Does this mean we lose Leveque?</i>

1206
01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:55.335
Jackson. what happens to my family
if you lose Leveque?

1207
01:29:04.845 --> 01:29:05.846
I'm staying.

1208
01:29:17.649 --> 01:29:18.775
She's coming.

1209
01:29:20.277 --> 01:29:21.278
I know it.

1210
01:29:43.467 --> 01:29:49.515
Well. well. well. what a romantic spot
for our first official date.

1211
01:30:05.197 --> 01:30:09.159
I brought a little something special
for us to open up.

1212
01:30:12.287 --> 01:30:16.166
And some chaperone. Hope you don't mind.

1213
01:30:18.001 --> 01:30:22.339
I apologize. Yours are no longer with us.

1214
01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:25.175
It is more intimate this way. no?

1215
01:30:26.593 --> 01:30:28.220
Are you all right. Taxman?

1216
01:30:30.138 --> 01:30:32.891
I hate to think something
might ruin our night.

1217
01:30:37.855 --> 01:30:40.732
- Thank you.
- For what?

1218
01:30:40.732 --> 01:30:43.110
For helping me with my chaperones.

1219
01:30:43.944 --> 01:30:46.947
Saves me the hassle
of having to kill them myself.

1220
01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:50.033
It was my pleasure.

1221
01:30:52.494 --> 01:30:54.413
But somehow I don't believe you.

1222
01:30:55.497 --> 01:30:57.291
Well. I don't care what you believe.

1223
01:30:58.292 --> 01:31:02.546
My intention is to walk out of here
a very rich man and disappear.

1224
01:31:02.546 --> 01:31:06.800
The great Taxman betraying his country.

1225
01:31:08.343 --> 01:31:11.680
No. Why would you do that?

1226
01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:17.686
What you said to me
about wasting my life. Made me think.

1227
01:31:20.772 --> 01:31:22.774
Let's not delay this new beginning.

1228
01:31:24.568 --> 01:31:25.652
The passcode.

1229
01:31:31.867 --> 01:31:32.701
Money first.

1230
01:31:34.453 --> 01:31:38.207
And... my price doubled.

1231
01:31:38.207 --> 01:31:40.501
Negotiations are over.

1232
01:31:43.128 --> 01:31:47.966
Well. negotiations are never over anytime.

1233
01:31:47.966 --> 01:31:48.967
You know. it...

1234
01:31:49.801 --> 01:31:51.720
actually reminds me of this one time
I was...

1235
01:31:53.639 --> 01:31:56.266
I was selling missiles to a arms dealer.

1236
01:31:56.266 --> 01:31:59.353
and he was haggling and haggling.
wouldn't stop.

1237
01:31:59.353 --> 01:32:01.855
Finally. he bought the missiles and...

1238
01:32:03.774 --> 01:32:05.734
And he comes back an hour later.
and he says.

1239
01:32:05.734 --> 01:32:08.320
"I paid too much for these missiles.
I want a better price." you know.

1240
01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.906
And I said. "That's not how this works.
You can't haggle now."

1241
01:32:10.906 --> 01:32:14.201
He says. "I want a full refund.
I don't even want the missiles anymore."

1242
01:32:14.201 --> 01:32:17.037
I said to him. "Look.
I can't take these missiles back.

1243
01:32:17.037 --> 01:32:19.206
- You've had them for an hour."
- Enough!

1244
01:32:20.374 --> 01:32:22.459
The passcode now!

1245
01:32:23.210 --> 01:32:24.753
Or you both die.

1246
01:32:27.005 --> 01:32:28.423
He gets very upset.

1247
01:32:29.883 --> 01:32:31.260
Do you have the passcode?

1248
01:32:33.387 --> 01:32:35.097
Do you have the passcode or not?

1249
01:32:35.597 --> 01:32:39.059
'Cause it is going to be very painful
for both of us if you do not.

1250
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.270
My friend?

1251
01:33:11.049 --> 01:33:12.384
I'm sorry I'm late.

1252
01:33:18.807 --> 01:33:19.933
Glad you could make it.

1253
01:33:20.517 --> 01:33:24.021
Well. what can I say?
You might be growing on me.

1254
01:33:25.647 --> 01:33:26.815
What is this?

1255
01:33:27.399 --> 01:33:30.235
An opportunity for me to check out
all the players.

1256
01:33:30.235 --> 01:33:33.322
Mr. Utami. since you're the one
with the money. I'll address you.

1257
01:33:33.822 --> 01:33:36.909
The price of the passcode
is exactly half of Leveque's fee.

1258
01:33:38.327 --> 01:33:43.290
Wire it to this account
after that case opens.

1259
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:45.626
You are the Taxman.

1260
01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:47.544
Here to collect.

1261
01:33:53.091 --> 01:33:55.761
In that case. then who are you?

1262
01:33:55.761 --> 01:33:56.887
My boyfriend.

1263
01:33:58.972 --> 01:34:00.057
Damn straight.

1264
01:34:00.974 --> 01:34:03.310
If you have the passcode.
I accept your terms.

1265
01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:05.312
- Mr. Utami--
- Open it.

1266
01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:09.775
You have the passcode?

1267
01:34:09.775 --> 01:34:11.693
I still have friends at the agency.

1268
01:34:13.278 --> 01:34:14.446
Wait a minute. You can't open that.

1269
01:34:14.446 --> 01:34:17.783
When the people you love are in danger.
you do whatever it takes.

1270
01:34:47.396 --> 01:34:48.272
Voilà.

1271
01:34:49.481 --> 01:34:51.900
Aztec. as promised.

1272
01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:56.029
Thank you very much.

1273
01:35:04.872 --> 01:35:06.748
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

1274
01:35:06.748 --> 01:35:08.375
Yes. thank you very much.

1275
01:35:09.001 --> 01:35:13.839
However. my business is not yet finished.
but you are.

1276
01:35:13.839 --> 01:35:17.801
What makes you think I will let you two
out of here alive?

1277
01:35:18.385 --> 01:35:22.139
The ten-million-dollar bounty
I put on your head might help.

1278
01:35:24.349 --> 01:35:27.728
I don't know
how many bounty hunters are here.

1279
01:35:27.728 --> 01:35:29.855
but they definitely know about you.

1280
01:35:32.649 --> 01:35:34.151
Know what's funny?

1281
01:35:34.651 --> 01:35:38.906
Like you. I didn't actually have
the money until just now.

1282
01:35:38.906 --> 01:35:41.116
but the bounty hunters
didn't need to know that.

1283
01:35:41.116 --> 01:35:42.618
They just needed to know where you were.

1284
01:35:42.618 --> 01:35:45.120
Okay. Leveque.
You're worth a lot of money.

1285
01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:48.081
- I'll take that from you.
- Gun!

1286
01:35:48.624 --> 01:35:51.877
Nobody move!

1287
01:35:53.879 --> 01:35:56.131
You are so dead. my friend.

1288
01:35:56.131 --> 01:35:59.134
Tell your guys not to do anything stupid.

1289
01:36:23.242 --> 01:36:26.036
And what is the plan. huh?
Now what are you going to do?

1290
01:36:26.912 --> 01:36:28.789
Do nothing. You're coming with me.

1291
01:36:28.789 --> 01:36:30.791
How can I do nothing and come with you?

1292
01:36:30.791 --> 01:36:33.418
You idiot.
how are you going to get out of here?

1293
01:36:33.418 --> 01:36:38.173
I'll give you 20 million to shoot
this one. To kill her right now.

1294
01:36:50.644 --> 01:36:51.812
Are you ready?

1295
01:36:51.812 --> 01:36:54.147
Ready for what?
No. I'm not. I'm definitely not. What--

1296
01:37:31.143 --> 01:37:34.980
You flush them forward.
I will cut around. Get the vial. Now! Go!

1297
01:37:37.983 --> 01:37:38.984
Stairs.

1298
01:38:04.635 --> 01:38:05.844
Where you going?

1299
01:38:22.653 --> 01:38:23.946
Sadie?

1300
01:38:23.946 --> 01:38:25.322
I'm an ally.

1301
01:38:26.031 --> 01:38:28.408
- Jonas?
- I have missed you so much.

1302
01:38:29.368 --> 01:38:31.495
Listen. it was never gonna
work out between us.

1303
01:38:31.495 --> 01:38:33.914
No. no. no. no. Of course it wasn't.
I was losing too many body parts.

1304
01:38:33.914 --> 01:38:35.958
That's not sustainable.
But if you look on the bright side.

1305
01:38:35.958 --> 01:38:37.292
I still have 20 vision.

1306
01:38:40.212 --> 01:38:41.922
Jonas.
I'm in the middle of something here.

1307
01:38:41.922 --> 01:38:44.925
I know. Look. losing the eye sucked.

1308
01:38:44.925 --> 01:38:47.010
But I'll tell you.
getting this thing blown off.

1309
01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:48.846
that was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1310
01:38:48.846 --> 01:38:53.100
Seriously. it changed my whole life.
I'm a good. solid. active listener now.

1311
01:38:54.518 --> 01:38:55.811
That's the other ear.

1312
01:38:55.811 --> 01:38:58.522
I didn't need the ear.
You keep going. You do what you do.

1313
01:39:05.487 --> 01:39:06.780
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.

1314
01:39:09.157 --> 01:39:11.618
All right. yes.
That looked cool. but cheating.

1315
01:39:11.618 --> 01:39:15.122
You're not the Taxman.
Who the hell are you?

1316
01:39:15.122 --> 01:39:16.206
What she said.

1317
01:39:17.499 --> 01:39:18.959
I'm the boyfriend.

1318
01:39:39.605 --> 01:39:41.064
No!

1319
01:39:51.867 --> 01:39:53.160
You need to get me out.

1320
01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:54.703
No. you stay here.

1321
01:40:20.979 --> 01:40:22.231
Give me the weapon.

1322
01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.119
Damn it.

1323
01:40:36.119 --> 01:40:38.956
Come on. Taxman. Give me my weapon.

1324
01:41:12.656 --> 01:41:14.575
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1325
01:41:16.159 --> 01:41:18.161
Squandering all this talent.

1326
01:41:18.996 --> 01:41:22.374
- You and I could've had so much working--
- There's nothing you have that I want.

1327
01:41:42.477 --> 01:41:46.523
What is it that you want. huh?
You want a boyfriend? So pedestrian.

1328
01:41:47.691 --> 01:41:50.652
He does not know you.
He does not see the real you.

1329
01:42:02.164 --> 01:42:03.582
Cole?

1330
01:42:07.503 --> 01:42:08.545
Cole!

1331
01:42:42.871 --> 01:42:44.331
Get me over there!

1332
01:43:07.479 --> 01:43:09.273
You look amazing in that dress.

1333
01:43:10.607 --> 01:43:12.609
And you should wear more suits.

1334
01:43:36.383 --> 01:43:40.554
- He almost died in a refrigerator.
- But I did not do that. That was his.

1335
01:43:40.554 --> 01:43:42.973
- In a refrigerator. for how long?
- Was it you?

1336
01:43:42.973 --> 01:43:45.350
- Why would I put a cat in a fridge?
- What are you talking about?

1337
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:47.186
- You didn't put him in.
- I think it's pretty clear.

1338
01:43:47.186 --> 01:43:50.189
- You didn't notice him when you closed it.
- Not the cat story.

1339
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:53.275
- He did it.
- Yeah. the cat story again.

1340
01:43:53.275 --> 01:43:56.862
So. Europe by rail.
That sounds so romantic.

1341
01:43:56.862 --> 01:43:58.739
You want to write a book.
you got to do research.

1342
01:43:58.739 --> 01:44:00.407
What's Sadie supposed to do
in all these places

1343
01:44:00.407 --> 01:44:02.284
while you're reading musty old scrolls
about farming?

1344
01:44:02.284 --> 01:44:06.163
Don't worry about me. I have a whole list
of clients I need to hunt down.

1345
01:44:06.747 --> 01:44:08.290
I'm sure you're gonna get them all. dear.

1346
01:44:08.290 --> 01:44:09.249
I know I will.

1347
01:44:09.249 --> 01:44:10.417
Yeah. she will.

1348
01:44:10.417 --> 01:44:12.586
Art curating is so much more exciting
than I imagined.

1349
01:44:12.586 --> 01:44:14.963
- Yeah
- Yeah. God. like. I want to be you.

1350
01:44:14.963 --> 01:44:17.424
I mean. except the part where
you're sleeping with my brother.

1351
01:44:17.424 --> 01:44:18.550
What?

1352
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:20.177
Just. please.

1353
01:44:20.177 --> 01:44:21.512
- So...
- We're at the dinner table.

1354
01:44:21.512 --> 01:44:23.764
You guys promise to take care
of this little guy while we're gone?

1355
01:44:23.764 --> 01:44:25.307
Yes. I love succulents.

1356
01:44:25.307 --> 01:44:28.685
- How hard is it to keep a cactus alive?
- Sometimes harder than you think.

1357
01:44:28.685 --> 01:44:31.688
- But worth it.
- Very much.

1358
01:44:33.273 --> 01:44:35.234
I mean. we're talking about a cactus.
Right?

1359
01:44:35.234 --> 01:44:36.610
You water it once a month.

1360
01:44:36.610 --> 01:44:38.820
- Or are we talking-- Okay. It's subtext.
- Okay.

1361
01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:40.447
- That's right.
- There's a--

1362
01:44:40.447 --> 01:44:42.282
- There's a hidden meaning.
- Yep. There's-- And then--

1363
01:44:42.282 --> 01:44:43.742
- Levels.
- Okay. that's great.

1364
01:44:43.742 --> 01:44:46.495
- Your mother and I have a--
- There's no "mother and I" story.

1365
01:44:46.495 --> 01:44:48.872
- It's not about a cactus.
- No. it is not.

1366
01:44:48.872 --> 01:44:50.165
It involves wrestling.

1367
01:44:51.416 --> 01:44:54.962
Did he ever tell you that he wrestled
in high school?

1368
01:44:54.962 --> 01:44:56.713
Keep drinking your wine.
Keep drinking your wine.

1369
01:44:56.713 --> 01:44:58.173
Okay.

1370
01:45:11.395 --> 01:45:15.649
- Hey. babe. I'm sorry I'm late.
- Nice car.

1371
01:45:16.608 --> 01:45:19.736
Are you sure the CIA didn't let you
keep Utami's money after all?

1372
01:45:19.736 --> 01:45:22.322
You wish. I'm borrowing this.

1373
01:45:22.322 --> 01:45:24.449
How was your meeting
with Professor Kirkland?

1374
01:45:24.449 --> 01:45:25.868
- Really good.
