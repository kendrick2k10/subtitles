* *

5
00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.898
- Wrestling is not
a love story.

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.650
It's much more.

7
00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:29.612

8
00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:30.989

10
00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.245
An excuse to be a kid again.

12
00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.583

the moment we are in.

14
00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.884
A great man once said that.

15
00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:54.137
That man is my brother.

16
00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:56.097
Windham Rotunda.

17
00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.099
[cheers and applause]

[dramatic music]

20
00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.067
Tell me this wasn't
meant to be.

22
00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:12.030
He knew where he was going
from the beginning.

24
00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.035
- There's something going on.

25
00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.914

29
00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:28.129
- Bray Wyatt was chaos.

30
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.464
The ultimate villain.

31

- I am Bray Wyatt.
the new face of fear.

32
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.471
- He had the charisma that
so many guys don't have.

33
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.098
- Can you feel that?
[laughs]

34
00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:39.474
- That "it" quality.

35
00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:42.143
- You hold 100.000 people
in the palm of your hand.

36
00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:44.104
- You've got it all.

38
00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:49.109
- When it comes to creativity.
Windham had no peers.

39
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.360
- Can I see
what that looks like?

40
00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:52.195
- He was not scared
to push the limits.

41
00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:53.738
- Yowie-wowie!

42
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.198
- He was a genius.

43
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.451
- Dreaming of all these ideas.
it's such a cool feeling.

44
00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:00.578
- He changed a whole industry.

45
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.497
- [laughs]

46
00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.792
- He put his heart and soul
out on his sleeve.

47
00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:07.836
It's one of the geniuses
of him. but it's also

48
00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:10.171
one of the things that was
difficult to work with him on.

49
00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:17.012
- When you hit creative
roadblocks. you reform.

50
00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:18.138
And that's what he did.

51
00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.806
* *

52
00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:22.976
- It's time to rewrite
my own story.

[dramatic music]

54
00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:29.190
The ridiculously hard times
are what strengthened me.

55
00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:33.737
When I was weak. when I was
vulnerable. when I was down.

56
00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.113
you were there.

57
00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.489
[cheers and applause]

58
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.241
This is the best
I've ever felt.

- He had so much more
that he wanted to do.

62
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.172

behind for everyone

63
00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.923

- Creativity.

67
00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:12.400
It comes from many places
and takes many shapes.

68
00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:17.197
The place is
Western Pennsylvania.

69
00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:23.411
The shape is a character
forever known as Bray Wyatt.

75
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.175
My name is Jason Baker.

76
00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:40.679
I'm a special makeup effects
artist and film director.

77
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.597
- Wild looking at all this.

78
00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.224
- I know.

79
00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.727
I had the honor of creating
most of Windham's costumes

80
00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.605
and all of his insane ideas.

81
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.816
- You look and see
all the things he's done

82
00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.359
and accomplished.

83
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.028
- I wish he was here
to share it with us.

84
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.615
- Now it's up to us
to give him something

85
00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.369
he deserves that will
let him live on forever.

86
00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.122
We owe him something big.

87
00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:08.540
- It's going to be wild.

88
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.627
- Something to truly
honor his legacy.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:19.092

Small little town.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.073
You know. everybody knows
your business.

94
00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.742
Everybody knows who you are.

95
00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.202
Everybody knew who my family
was growing up. obviously.

96
00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.787
- Come on and let's fight.

97
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:50.707
- Blackjack Mulligan
is my grandfather.

98
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:52.125
- Blackjack Mulligan.

99
00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.960
What a monster.

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.796

Mike Rotunda.

A tremendous wrestler.

106
00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:11.895
- I was wrestling
down in Florida.

107
00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:13.646
and Dusty Rhodes was
the booker.

108
00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:16.900
And he put Barry and I
as a tag team together.

109
00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:22.989
- Barry Windham
joining Mike Rotunda.

110
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:26.534
- His sister Stephanie
came down to visit.

111
00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:30.163
- My sister had come
to stay with me.

112
00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:33.333
Mike. of course. being my
best friend. was always over.

113
00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.584
You know. I noticed that

114
00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:37.754
they were kind of
eyeballing each other.

115
00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:40.632
- I wasn't supposed to really
be around the wrestlers.

116
00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:42.676
Said I wasn't interested.

117
00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:46.096
And then I married him
six months later.

118
00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:49.224
And we've been married
40 years.

119
00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.893
- Over the next few years.
the couple

120
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:56.606
traveled the world together
as Mike became a champion.

121
00:05:56.648 --> 00:05:57.607
- Over the hip.

122
00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.943
Shoulders down.

123
00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:01.569
Yes. indeed!

124
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.655
We have new
tag team champions.

125
00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:07.242
Barry Windham. Mike Rotunda.

126
00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:10.120
- And competed in
the first-ever WrestleMania

127
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.872
in New York City.

128
00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.250
- Rotunda now gets
the Sheik up.

129
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.420
Well-executed suplex.

130
00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:21.423
- Eventually.
they settled in Brooksville.

131
00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:25.593
And on May 23. 1987.

132
00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.638
Windham Lawrence Rotunda
was born.

133
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.889
- I was wrestling in

134
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.766
Championship Wrestling
of Florida.

135
00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.436
and I wrestled Ric Flair
that night.

136
00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.354
So I get home.
nobody's at the house.

137
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:40.608
My mother-in-law and Steph
were at the hospital.

138
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.319
They ended up doing
an emergency C-section

139
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:46.489
because Windham was a big kid.

140
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.450
- He was almost 10 pounds.

141
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:51.119
Windham was named
from the beginning

142
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:52.871
'cause it's my maiden name.

143
00:06:52.912 --> 00:06:55.665
He was like
the little Gerber baby.

144
00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:57.751
Bright. blue eyes and smiley

145
00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:01.129
and curly little blonde
ringlets of hair.

146
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:02.630
He was beautiful.

147
00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.093
When he was a little bitty.
like. two and three.

148
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.137
he would stand
in front of the TV.

149
00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:12.349
and he knew "Ghostbusters."

150
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.602
"Beetlejuice" line-for-line.

151
00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:18.229
- He would watch these movies.

152
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:22.442
and he would voice
pretty much the whole movie

153
00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.569
at that young age.

154
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:27.447
- I remember when he read
all the Goosebumps books.

155
00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:30.575
He was addicted to 'em.

156
00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.160
But he was just such
an imaginative.

157
00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:34.788
imaginative character.
and he was always

158
00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.457
the center of attention
wherever he went.

159
00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:39.292
[soft music]

160
00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:42.462
- Windham wouldn't be
an only child for long.

161
00:07:42.504 --> 00:07:47.467
When he was three years old.
he got a brother. Taylor.

162
00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:49.719
* *

163
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:53.139
- Windham was always
somebody I looked up to.

164
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:56.226
Most little brothers do
look up to a bigger brother.

165
00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.853
But Windham...

166
00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:01.606
I wanted to be just like him.

167
00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.650
- And three years later.

168
00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:07.278
he got a little sister too:
Mika.

169
00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:11.658
- Brothers are awesome.
and I had the two best.

170
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.993
I have felt that way
my whole life.

171
00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.829
Windham and Taylor
were my protectors

172
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.832
and they were my friends
and my confidants.

173
00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:20.458
- We were all really.
really close.

174
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.627
But in our younger years.
me and Windham

175
00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.129
played practical jokes.

176
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.464
We convinced her at one point
that there was

177
00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:29.342
an invisible man
living in her closet.

178
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.845
Anytime she was about
to tell on us. we'd be like.

179
00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:35.306
do you want us to call on--hmm?

180
00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.559
- Those kids played hard
with each other.

181
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.768
I remember them.
like. roughhousing

182
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.061
in our living room.

183
00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.731
We were really close
to Mike and Stephanie

184
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.691
and Windham and Taylor
growing up.

185
00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:47.694
Mike was one of my dad's
best friends.

186
00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:49.988
Those kids. they were vibrant.

187
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.574
They. all three. have
so much personality.

188
00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.495
[cheers and applause]

189
00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:01.041
- As the Rotunda children
grew up. their father

190
00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:04.210
developed a new identity
in the ring.

191
00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:07.005
- My dad was IRS.
Irwin R. Schyster.

192
00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:14.054
- I told you tax cheats before.
everyone pays their taxes!

193
00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:18.767
No one will rest in peace
until all your taxes are paid.

194
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.810
[crowd booing]

195
00:09:20.852 --> 00:09:26.149
- Even I shared the ring
with IRS.

196
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:27.400
- Look at this!

197
00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:28.777
Yeah!

198
00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:34.282
- I remember seeing
young Bray Wyatt

199
00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:36.076
just hanging out back
watching his dad.

200
00:09:36.117 --> 00:09:38.745
just mesmerized. you know.
watching his dad stretch

201
00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:40.413
and work out in the ring.

202
00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:43.625
You know. you could tell
he wanted to be in the ring.

203
00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:46.836
- I remember
one time in particular.

204
00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:50.423
I saw my dad was in
a tag match with Ted DiBiase

205
00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:51.925
against The Nasty Boys.

206
00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:54.427
- Oh. God. Look at this.
Uh-oh.

207
00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:55.720
- Will it be the pit stop?

208
00:09:55.762 --> 00:09:57.972
- I wanna see this.

209
00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.933
- They put my dad
in the corner.

210
00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.477
and they stuck their armpits
in his face.

211
00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.229
And I remember being backstage

212
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.314
and my mom having
to hold me back

213
00:10:06.356 --> 00:10:08.233
because I was a little
7-year-old kid

214
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:10.443
and I was about to run
in this ring.

215
00:10:10.485 --> 00:10:11.778
That's where it started.

216
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.279
I knew that I had
to get in there.

217
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:15.115
I wanted to be
just like my dad.

218
00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:17.242
I wanted to be in the WWE.

219
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:24.708
- By the early 2000s.
Windham used his size

220
00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:27.502
to excel in
high school sports.

221
00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:30.130
- Growing up. especially
if you're heavyset like I was

222
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:31.631
when I was a kid.
you had to learn

223
00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.967
how to be tough
at a real young age.

224
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:36.302
As soon as I was old enough.
any contact sport

225
00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:39.139
I could get my hands on.
I was into it.

226
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.598
- He was a good
football player.

227
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.683
Played both ways.

228
00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.310
Made all-star teams.

229
00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:46.771
- He really. really was
an unbelievable athlete.

230
00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.149
He ran a 4.8 40.

231
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.901
And the strength he had
and the agility for the size

232
00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:54.446
that he had. just unbelievable.

233
00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.532
- Windham was an anomaly--
everything. but especially

234
00:10:57.574 --> 00:10:59.159
amateur wrestling
and high school.

235
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.453
By the time it was time
for his match.

236
00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:03.288
the gym would quiet down.

237
00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:05.415
And when he would wrestle.
the whole gymnasium

238
00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:07.792
would just stop to watch
what he was doing.

239
00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:11.338
He was a draw at 17.

240
00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:14.549
- Windham won the heavyweight
wrestling state title

241
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:17.344
and was all-state in football.

242
00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:21.765
In 2005. he graduated
and chose to continue

243
00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:26.102
playing football
3.000 miles away.

244
00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:27.604
- I went and played
junior college football

245
00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:31.733
at College of the Sequoias
in Visalia. California.

246
00:11:31.775 --> 00:11:34.527
- Windham excelled and was
named an All-American

247
00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.363
offensive lineman.

248
00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:39.032
Two years later.
he transferred to Division I

249
00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:43.244
Troy University in Alabama.

250
00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.288
- I think that's where
I really learned to be tough.

251
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.915
You know. it pushed me
to the edge.

252
00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:49.668
To play in Division I
football ain't no joke.

253
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:52.545
- Being a college athlete
was incredibly challenging.

254
00:11:52.587 --> 00:11:54.255
It's a full-time job.

255
00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:56.007
When you're coming up
in a family

256
00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.509
of professional athletes

257
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.053
and you see this devotion.
you don't know anything

258
00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:02.514
other than to give
everything you've got.

259
00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:05.016
He dreamt of playing
for the Oakland Raiders.

260
00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:07.227
And like. that's where
he wanted to be.

261
00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.437
and that's what
he wanted to do.

262
00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:13.733
- While Windham worked
towards a future in the NFL.

263
00:12:13.775 --> 00:12:17.987
he often made the 6.5-hour
drive home to see his family

264
00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:20.031
in Brooksville.

265
00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:22.325
- I was 15. and I was
very self-conscious

266
00:12:22.367 --> 00:12:24.035
because I was really
overweight.

267
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:27.163
And the only thing that
made it better was Windham.

268
00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:28.957
And I called him
and I told him.

269
00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.834
I'm the only freshman
on homecoming court.

270
00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.712
And I said. I know you're in
the middle of football season.

271
00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.005
It would mean everything
if you could just

272
00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.257
walk me down the field.

273
00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.050
He showed up with
a bouquet of flowers.

274
00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.593
And I was so scared.

275
00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.929
But when your big brother.
who's your hero.

276
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:45.015
who's your favorite icon.
shows up

277
00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:48.393
just to walk you
down the field. it vanishes.

278
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:50.395
- When I was a senior
in high school.

279
00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.772
I was going to
the state championships.

280
00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:54.774
And my brother was
a state champion.

281
00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:56.985
And I wanted to be
just like him.

282
00:12:57.027 --> 00:12:58.486
He wanted to come and see me.

283
00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:01.239
But he said. I'm only
going to come and see you

284
00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.034
in the finals because I know
you're going to make it

285
00:13:04.075 --> 00:13:06.119
to the finals and I know
you're going to win.

286
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:08.079
And that's all I need to see.

287
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:11.374
So long story short.
I went into the tournament

288
00:13:11.416 --> 00:13:14.919
and I suffered an injury
and I was unable to compete.

289
00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:16.671
And the only thing
running through my head

290
00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:18.882
was I let my brother down.

291
00:13:18.923 --> 00:13:20.425
* *

292
00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:22.802
Finally got home.
and Windham was already

293
00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:24.137
waiting in the driveway

294
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:25.889
sitting on the back
of his tailgate.

295
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.432
And before I even
made it to him.

296
00:13:27.474 --> 00:13:32.479
he made it to me
with a big hug.

297
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.147
And...

298
00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.069
He whispered into my ear...

299
00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:46.284
"None of that shit matters."

300
00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:48.703
None of that shit matters.

301
00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.789
That's really who Windham was.

302
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.209
It was the love
of his family and making sure

303
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.963
I felt OK after
I felt like I let him down.

304
00:13:59.005 --> 00:14:02.175
That's what mattered to him.

305
00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:05.387
- By 2008.
Windham was relegated

306
00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:08.348
to a backup role on the Troy
University football team.

307
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:12.769
and his playing time
was limited.

308
00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:15.939
- That was kind of a hard time
for him because. of course.

309
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.191
his aspirations
were pro football.

310
00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:23.363
And it dawned on him that
that wasn't going to happen.

311
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:26.449
- That same year.
his 18-year-old brother Taylor

312
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:31.204
signed with WWE and joined
their developmental system.

313
00:14:31.246 --> 00:14:32.664
- I was having my first match.

314
00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:35.542
and Windham drove down
from Troy.

315
00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:38.712
I got done and went
and met him after.

316
00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:41.673
And he's like. "I'm not
going back to school.

317
00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.092
I want to do this with you."

318
00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:47.595
- That decision would change
the course of Windham's life.

319
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.020
[tense music]

320
00:14:55.061 --> 00:14:57.689
* *

321
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.111
- In 2008. Windham walked away

322
00:15:03.153 --> 00:15:04.946
from the Troy University's
football team

323
00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:06.573
and joined his brother Taylor

324
00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.909
in WWE's developmental
system. FCW.

325
00:15:09.951 --> 00:15:12.245
all: FCW! FCW!
- Slow down. folks.

326
00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:14.497
- Windham came
from college football.

327
00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:17.625
And then kind of overnight.
was just with FCW.

328
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.670
And yeah. everything
was new and everything

329
00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:22.714
was scary and exciting.

330
00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.466
But I think what
gave him comfort

331
00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.676
was that his brother was there.

332
00:15:26.718 --> 00:15:29.596
- He moved down to Tampa.
and we got a house together.

333
00:15:29.637 --> 00:15:32.015
And we loved it.

334
00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:35.018
It was one of my favorite
times of my life.

335
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.103
We did everything together.

336
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:38.271
We went to work together.

337
00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:39.647
We talked about work.

338
00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.067
And we ended up starting
to tag together.

339
00:15:42.108 --> 00:15:43.943
And we were
Bo and Duke Rotundo.

340
00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:47.197
And that was our life.

341
00:15:47.238 --> 00:15:48.740
- I was 16.

342
00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:50.158
I got my driver's license.

343
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.826
And the first place
I ever drove

344
00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:55.955
was to the Brooksville armory
to watch my brothers.

345
00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:58.875
- From Brooksville. Florida.

346
00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:03.296
Bo and Duke Rotundo!

347
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:05.465
[cheers and applause]

348
00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:07.592
- Proud papa. Proud mama.

349
00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:10.178
My parents were both
really proud of the boys.

350
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.180
- They didn't get any
roads paved for them

351
00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:13.598
or silver spoon handed to them.

352
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.351
They had to come in
like everybody else.

353
00:16:16.393 --> 00:16:18.353
- What an opportunity here
to see two

354
00:16:18.395 --> 00:16:20.480
homegrown guys. man.
right here.

355
00:16:20.522 --> 00:16:22.148
Duke and Bo. man.
this is going to be

356
00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:23.650
a really special outing
for them.

357
00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:25.694
Big ol' Duke just
a roughhouse.

358
00:16:25.735 --> 00:16:29.155
He's a little green still.
but he's got the get-go will.

359
00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.326
- This is a really.
really tough business.

360
00:16:33.368 --> 00:16:35.203
But to have someone

361
00:16:35.245 --> 00:16:37.664
that you can trust
with absolutely anything

362
00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:40.625
is unheard of in this business.
and I had that.

363
00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:43.128
You are looking at
the most explosive tag team

364
00:16:43.169 --> 00:16:47.257
in FCW. the Rotundo Brothers.

365
00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:50.260
- And it's high time that
we bring those titles back

366
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:54.848
to their new rightful home.
Brooksville. Florida.

367
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:58.768
- We have new
tag team champions.

368
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.855
the Rotundos. Bo and Duke.

369
00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:04.190
- Right away.
the Rotundo Brothers

370
00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:07.318
impressed a WWE legend.

371
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.779
- I had offered my gym
Hard Nocks South

372
00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:13.116
as the first developmental
strength territory.

373
00:17:13.158 --> 00:17:15.243
So I used to see Windham
all the time.

374
00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.829
We separated them into groups

375
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:19.372
based on their
athletic ability.

376
00:17:19.414 --> 00:17:21.291
and Windham was in
the top group.

377
00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.126
But he was the only guy
that would have

378
00:17:23.168 --> 00:17:25.795
everyone laughing all the time.

379
00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:30.216
He would come up with sketches
in the gym. bring costumes.

380
00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.344
- It puts the lotion
on its skin.

381
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:34.095
or else it gets the hose again.

382
00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:35.764
- Do you want to get
dipped in water?

383
00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:36.973
- Yeah.

384
00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:38.099
- You can't swim
with Saran wrap on.

385
00:17:38.141 --> 00:17:40.352
- Bad boys don't get headbands.

386
00:17:40.393 --> 00:17:42.103
- It's one of those things
you see on and be like.

387
00:17:42.145 --> 00:17:43.855
he's on to something.

388
00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:45.398
- Look into these eyes. boy.

389
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.193
A demon lives
behind these eyes.

390
00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:51.196
A demon that you created.

391
00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:54.324
- I mean. you could go back
and find old tapes of Windham

392
00:17:54.366 --> 00:17:55.617
at promo class.

393
00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:57.285
You could take any one
of those characters

394
00:17:57.327 --> 00:17:59.746
and put them right on TV.

395
00:17:59.788 --> 00:18:02.457
- Windham's magnetic
personality and work ethic

396
00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.709
didn't go unnoticed.

397
00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:07.754
Within a year.
the 23-year-old would be

398
00:18:07.796 --> 00:18:11.174
featured on a new show
called "NXT."

399
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.011
- "NXT" was a game show
where. essentially.

400
00:18:15.053 --> 00:18:17.514
you had up-and-coming
wrestlers who would compete

401
00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:19.599
to be the next breakout star.

402
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.685
And then we had a group
of what were termed to be

403
00:18:21.726 --> 00:18:24.646
pros who were acting
as judges.

404
00:18:24.688 --> 00:18:27.982
- And Windham got a new name.

405
00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.610
- I don't believe Cody Rhodes
is that enthused

406
00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:34.280
about his rookie Husky Harris.

407
00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.157
- Well. he was called
Husky Harris.

408
00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:38.243
- I thought it was a little--
you know.

409
00:18:38.284 --> 00:18:41.413
it wasn't complimentary
by any means.

410
00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.748
- I know Windham really
didn't like the name.

411
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.750
He felt it was poking fun
at his physique

412
00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:46.543
more than anything.

413
00:18:46.584 --> 00:18:47.877
- What can you say about

414
00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.879
Husky Harris
that you can't see?

415
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:51.047
- He's husky.

416
00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.424
- Come on. baby!

417
00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.759
- Husky Harris?

418
00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:56.219
I don't know. man.

419
00:18:56.261 --> 00:18:57.637
I can only imagine
how frustrated

420
00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:58.930
he must have been with that.

421
00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.182
I don't know if.
in my most creative hour.

422
00:19:01.224 --> 00:19:02.434
could I have made this work.

423
00:19:02.475 --> 00:19:04.352
- She wants me. Hmm.

424
00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:08.815
- Oh. God.

425
00:19:08.857 --> 00:19:10.191
- Terrible.

426
00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:12.861
When I look back
at the Husky Harris.

427
00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:15.864
I just see that sad
little boy.

428
00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.033
It was just a terrible.
terrible time.

429
00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:20.952
And it was a figment of
someone else's imagination

430
00:19:20.994 --> 00:19:23.580
that they tried
to push on a person.

431
00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:26.499
- I feel like he knew in
his heart that wasn't what

432
00:19:26.541 --> 00:19:28.543
his destiny was supposed to be.

433
00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:31.046
That Husky Harris character.
it allowed him to want more.

434
00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.131
It drove him to want more.

435
00:19:34.049 --> 00:19:36.384
- While Windham wanted
more professionally.

436
00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:39.596
personally. he was thriving.

437
00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.890
Windham had been dating
his girlfriend Samantha

438
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.017
for three years.

439
00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:47.103
And on November 14. 2010.

440
00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:50.940
they welcomed
their first daughter. Cadyn.

441
00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.319
- He was on the European Tour.

442
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:56.613
And it started getting
closer and closer.

443
00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:59.407
And I called him and said. I'm
going to go to the hospital.

444
00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:01.951
I'm going.
He's like. oh. God.

445
00:20:01.993 --> 00:20:04.871
It was hours that he was
just on the phone with me.

446
00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:07.707
Sorry.

447
00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:10.710
And she was born.

448
00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:13.254
And he heard the whole thing.

449
00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:16.633
I refused to let anybody
see her until he saw her.

450
00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.593
And she was about two.
three days old.

451
00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.220
And he was like. oh. my God.

452
00:20:20.261 --> 00:20:21.846
He didn't know how to hold her.

453
00:20:21.888 --> 00:20:22.889
I said. like a football.

454
00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.766
You're good.

455
00:20:24.808 --> 00:20:28.186
- She was a happy-go-lucky
little girl and beautiful.

456
00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:31.690
And she looked just like him.

457
00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:33.692
- For sure.
it changed his life.

458
00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:36.736
It gave him direction
and a purpose

459
00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:38.822
because it wasn't just
about him anymore.

460
00:20:38.863 --> 00:20:41.241
It was about
his beautiful child.

461
00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.076
[soft music]

462
00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:46.871
- At that time. Paul Levesque.
also known as Triple H.

463
00:20:46.913 --> 00:20:50.625
was head of creative
for WWE Developmental.

464
00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:53.837
- Windham was in the company
as Husky Harris.

465
00:20:53.878 --> 00:20:55.422
Didn't feel like
it was working.

466
00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:57.674
Didn't feel like
it was going to work.

467
00:20:57.716 --> 00:20:59.592
I think we have him miscast.

468
00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:02.012
He's really talented.

469
00:21:02.053 --> 00:21:05.849
Let me take him.
put him back down in Florida.

470
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.395
and let me see
what I can get out of him.

471
00:21:13.106 --> 00:21:16.443
- He didn't want to be this
cookie-cutter--little tights.

472
00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:18.820
Windham from day one was
like. no [bleep] way. man.

473
00:21:18.862 --> 00:21:21.448
That's not my stuff.
I'm different.

474
00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:24.325
And he was sent back to FCW.

475
00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:28.705
He got in the car smiling.
laughing like. listen. listen.

476
00:21:30.874 --> 00:21:34.044
The entire 3 1/2-hour ride.
he was just showing me videos

477
00:21:34.085 --> 00:21:37.005
and telling me ideas
and all this stuff.

478
00:21:37.047 --> 00:21:40.050
It was crazy
and all over the place.

479
00:21:40.091 --> 00:21:42.719
And I'm like. what are you
even talking about. man?

480
00:21:42.761 --> 00:21:44.804
And he was telling me
about Waylon Mercy

481
00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:46.639
and we were watching
videos of that.

482
00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:49.768
- Waylon Mercy.
he's a peaceful man.

483
00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:52.937
He likes his peaceful
surroundings.

484
00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:55.565
- Those are the eeriest.
strangest-looking eyes

485
00:21:55.607 --> 00:21:56.858
I've ever seen.

486
00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.027
Look at this.

487
00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:01.946
- And he's telling me about
Robert De Niro's demeanor

488
00:22:01.988 --> 00:22:03.907
from "Cape Fear."

489
00:22:03.948 --> 00:22:07.243
The next week rolled around
and we had promo class.

490
00:22:07.285 --> 00:22:11.414
and it blew everybody's mind.

491
00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:15.460
- Because I am like God.
and God like me.

492
00:22:15.502 --> 00:22:17.253
You know. I'm as large as him.

493
00:22:17.295 --> 00:22:20.048
He is as small as I.

494
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.841
[chuckles]

495
00:22:21.883 --> 00:22:26.930
- And just like that.
Bray Wyatt was born.

496
00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:29.307
- He really attributed
a lot of Bray

497
00:22:29.349 --> 00:22:31.267
to growing up in Brooksville.

498
00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:33.603
- He had a really. really
close friend growing up.

499
00:22:33.645 --> 00:22:35.188
Brae White.

500
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:38.817
Still to this day. the craziest
mother[bleep] I've ever met.

501
00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:40.193
And this is a real person.

502
00:22:40.235 --> 00:22:42.153
He got in a car wreck
when he was younger

503
00:22:42.195 --> 00:22:43.488
and his head went
through the windshield

504
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.073
and he lost all
feeling in his face.

505
00:22:45.115 --> 00:22:46.658
so he'd just headbutt
anything.

506
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.662
And a lot
of his characteristics

507
00:22:50.704 --> 00:22:53.248
were taken and put
into the Bray Wyatt character.

508
00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:58.336
- I have never seen so clearly
in all my life.

509
00:22:58.378 --> 00:22:59.713
[laughs]

510
00:22:59.754 --> 00:23:02.048
- Windham's cousin's name
is Wyatt.

511
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:05.343
So Windham kind of mixed it up
and came up with Bray Wyatt.

512
00:23:05.385 --> 00:23:08.388
- And they say. Bray Wyatt.
well. he's crazy. man.

513
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.182
He's a psychopath.

514
00:23:11.224 --> 00:23:12.726
- He came out.
and everything about it--

515
00:23:12.767 --> 00:23:15.645
the presentation
and just the energy--

516
00:23:15.687 --> 00:23:18.481
we were like. oh. this is good.

517
00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:19.941
This jumps off the page.

518
00:23:19.983 --> 00:23:22.485
- [laughs]

519
00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:24.446
- It blew everybody away.

520
00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:26.072
You wouldn't even know
if he was there.

521
00:23:26.114 --> 00:23:28.199
And then all of a sudden.
Bray Wyatt would emerge.

522
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:30.285
And it was truly like
he walked into a phone booth

523
00:23:30.326 --> 00:23:32.245
and came out as Superman.

524
00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:33.747
- A lot of times.
those promos on promo day

525
00:23:33.788 --> 00:23:34.748
will be 60 seconds.

526
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:36.583
90 if you ask for it.

527
00:23:36.624 --> 00:23:37.917
Windham would go
up there sometimes

528
00:23:37.959 --> 00:23:39.627
for. like.
six or seven minutes.

529
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:42.255
I think Dusty gave him
just a lot of room

530
00:23:42.297 --> 00:23:44.257
to explore and to find
that character

531
00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:46.301
and to find the voice.

532
00:23:46.343 --> 00:23:49.804
- Dusty knew there was
something special there.

533
00:23:49.846 --> 00:23:51.806
and he wasn't
going to let it go.

534
00:23:51.848 --> 00:23:54.225
He knew Windham had
something that was

535
00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:56.770
going to change the business.

536
00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:58.772
- Said he was Bray.

537
00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:00.690
As we started
to enlighten the world

538
00:24:00.732 --> 00:24:03.234
who this Bray Wyatt
character was.

539
00:24:03.276 --> 00:24:07.197
Windham is such a unique kid
that he understands--

540
00:24:07.238 --> 00:24:08.490
he believes that.

541
00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:10.283
That's who he is.

542
00:24:10.325 --> 00:24:12.077
That's what makes him so good.

543
00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:21.711
- Dusty called me one day
and he said.

544
00:24:21.753 --> 00:24:23.254
"Kid. remember Husky?"

545
00:24:23.296 --> 00:24:24.673
And I was like. yeah.

546
00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:26.299
And he goes.
"He's got a new character.

547
00:24:26.341 --> 00:24:27.425
"You're going to love it.

548
00:24:27.467 --> 00:24:28.802
You got to come check it out."

549
00:24:28.843 --> 00:24:32.681
And he cut this promo.
and it was so bizarre.

550
00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:35.642
And Dusty said.
"What do you think?"

551
00:24:35.684 --> 00:24:38.603
And I'm like.
this is a movie character.

552
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.066
- Within months.
Windham had an idea.

553
00:24:43.108 --> 00:24:46.111
He wanted an on-screen family.

554
00:24:46.152 --> 00:24:48.780
But his brother Taylor was
already an established singles

555
00:24:48.822 --> 00:24:52.784
competitor known as Bo Dallas.

556
00:24:52.826 --> 00:24:58.832
Enter John Huber.
also known as Luke Harper.

557
00:24:58.873 --> 00:25:00.959
- I had flown to FCW
for the tryout.

558
00:25:01.001 --> 00:25:03.128
And then I get a call
from Windham.

559
00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:05.880
And about 10 minutes later.
I hang up the phone.

560
00:25:05.922 --> 00:25:07.215
I hadn't said a word.

561
00:25:07.257 --> 00:25:08.883
And this guy had--

562
00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:11.553
Bray--had rattled off about
a million different things.

563
00:25:11.594 --> 00:25:13.596
And I was like. oh. my God.
that dude's nuts.

564
00:25:13.638 --> 00:25:15.056
Like. wow.

565
00:25:16.933 --> 00:25:19.519
- Windham and Luke had
an immediate bond.

566
00:25:19.561 --> 00:25:21.062
They just connected.

567
00:25:21.104 --> 00:25:24.190
So initially. it just
started as Bray and Luke.

568
00:25:24.232 --> 00:25:27.485
We created this
environment where.

569
00:25:27.527 --> 00:25:30.613
is he really talking to people
or is this all in his mind?

570
00:25:30.655 --> 00:25:31.656
- Here we go.

571
00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:34.117
In three. two. one.

572
00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:35.201
Action.

573
00:25:35.243 --> 00:25:36.661
- Can you feel that?

574
00:25:36.703 --> 00:25:41.332
Come with me. and I will show
you a love that is power.

575
00:25:41.374 --> 00:25:44.044
- The first shoot.
he's on the river.

576
00:25:44.085 --> 00:25:46.546
It's in the forest
right down from our house.

577
00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:49.674
And the guys had to go back
in with the alligators

578
00:25:49.716 --> 00:25:52.135
and the mosquitoes
and everything.

579
00:25:52.177 --> 00:25:53.928
- I almost fell
on that one. buddy.

580
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:55.263
[laughs]

581
00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:57.515
- Our first house was
on 10 acres. and we

582
00:25:57.557 --> 00:26:00.185
were next to a zoo that
had lions and big cats

583
00:26:00.226 --> 00:26:02.062
and started hearing.
like. lion roars at night.

584
00:26:02.103 --> 00:26:04.230
So unique stuff would happen.

585
00:26:04.272 --> 00:26:05.482
And he pulled from that.

586
00:26:05.523 --> 00:26:08.693
- I wish you'd quit
lying to your children.

587
00:26:08.735 --> 00:26:11.029
telling them that there's
things out there that

588
00:26:11.071 --> 00:26:13.573
won't go bump in the night.

589
00:26:13.615 --> 00:26:15.241
What they going to do. man?

590
00:26:15.283 --> 00:26:19.204
What you going to do
to something like me?

591
00:26:19.245 --> 00:26:21.623
What can they do?

592
00:26:21.664 --> 00:26:23.249
Run.

593
00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:24.584
[tense music]

594
00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:26.169
- There was something special

595
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:29.756
and something interesting there
that could resonate.

596
00:26:29.798 --> 00:26:32.801
- My name is Bray Wyatt.

597
00:26:32.842 --> 00:26:34.594
Pleased to meet you. man.

598
00:26:34.636 --> 00:26:37.263
Help me welcome the first son

599
00:26:37.305 --> 00:26:41.976
of the Wyatt family.
Luke Harper.

600
00:26:42.018 --> 00:26:44.020
- This is getting weirder
by the second.

601
00:26:44.062 --> 00:26:45.855
- What is happening?

602
00:26:45.897 --> 00:26:48.024
- At the time.
I got this Viking gimmick.

603
00:26:48.066 --> 00:26:50.151
And I remember being
called into an office like.

604
00:26:50.193 --> 00:26:53.363
"OK. we want you
as the second son."

605
00:26:53.405 --> 00:26:55.615
And I was like. that's cool.

606
00:26:55.657 --> 00:26:57.283
What am I wearing?

607
00:26:57.325 --> 00:26:59.369
- Bray wanted Rowan
to wear a mask.

608
00:26:59.411 --> 00:27:02.122
So Rowan had a duffel bag
full of masks.

609
00:27:02.163 --> 00:27:05.000
And he pulls out
this sheep's mask.

610
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:06.751
And Bray was like.
oh. I love it.

611
00:27:06.793 --> 00:27:08.628
That's perfect.

612
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.296
- We are strong.

613
00:27:10.338 --> 00:27:12.257
We are dangerous.

614
00:27:12.298 --> 00:27:14.300
We are family.

615
00:27:14.342 --> 00:27:17.262
[laughs]

616
00:27:17.303 --> 00:27:19.723
- I would bring home
these big rocking chairs.

617
00:27:19.764 --> 00:27:21.558
and he and I
and Taylor and Mike

618
00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:22.851
would just mess them all up

619
00:27:22.892 --> 00:27:24.144
and make them look
rough and beat up.

620
00:27:24.185 --> 00:27:25.770
And that's
the one they'll see

621
00:27:25.812 --> 00:27:27.188
in the scene in the barn.

622
00:27:29.816 --> 00:27:31.317
- We were having a blast.

623
00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:33.319
Sometimes. we would watch
old interviews

624
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:35.113
with people that
were on death row

625
00:27:35.155 --> 00:27:37.407
because we're trying to see
how they speak.

626
00:27:37.449 --> 00:27:39.325
Why do they think
they're right?

627
00:27:39.367 --> 00:27:40.493
Just their mindset.

628
00:27:40.535 --> 00:27:42.412
And I think a lot of that
plays into. like.

629
00:27:42.454 --> 00:27:43.913
what he was able to create.

630
00:27:43.955 --> 00:27:46.332
[soft music]

631
00:27:46.374 --> 00:27:51.171
- At age 26. Bray Wyatt
was an immediate hit.

632
00:27:51.212 --> 00:27:55.759
As Windham's stardom grew.
so did his family.

633
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.719
He got married to Samantha.

634
00:27:57.761 --> 00:28:02.932
And on February 7. 2013.
his second daughter. Kendyl.

635
00:28:02.974 --> 00:28:05.352
was born.

636
00:28:05.393 --> 00:28:08.188
- Because he had missed
the first birth.

637
00:28:08.229 --> 00:28:09.856
I wanted to do
everything I could

638
00:28:09.898 --> 00:28:11.691
so he could be there
and experience it.

639
00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:13.151
Because I feel like
that's something

640
00:28:13.193 --> 00:28:14.527
that you have to experience.

641
00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:18.239
So we elected to be
induced with our second.

642
00:28:18.281 --> 00:28:20.867
That way. he could be there.

643
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:23.787
- Windham was born to do a lot
and to be a lot of things.

644
00:28:23.828 --> 00:28:25.705
But being a daddy
was number one.

645
00:28:25.747 --> 00:28:27.874
When he loved.
he loved massively.

646
00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:31.544
And he had a whole heart
to give to his babies.

647
00:28:31.586 --> 00:28:34.172
- We all knew Windham was
going to be a great father.

648
00:28:34.214 --> 00:28:38.385
I mean. one of his strongest
qualities is how much he loves.

649
00:28:38.426 --> 00:28:41.596
And he already had plans
on where he was going

650
00:28:41.638 --> 00:28:43.473
and what he was going
to do. but his children.

651
00:28:43.515 --> 00:28:48.561
they just further instilled
more and more drive in him.

652
00:28:48.603 --> 00:28:51.272
- Three. two...

653
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.066
[laughter]

654
00:28:53.108 --> 00:28:54.442
- Good. Good. Good.

655
00:28:54.484 --> 00:28:55.443
Tell them.

656
00:28:55.485 --> 00:28:56.569
Tell them. Bray.

657
00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:57.612
- There we go.

658
00:28:57.654 --> 00:28:59.989
Deep in the woods.

659
00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:01.241
- Real deep dive.

660
00:29:01.282 --> 00:29:02.242
- [laughs]

661
00:29:02.283 --> 00:29:03.702
- Come on. guys.

662
00:29:03.743 --> 00:29:05.453
Start it over.

663
00:29:06.329 --> 00:29:09.416
- Preparations were underway
to get the Wyatt family

664
00:29:09.457 --> 00:29:12.252
ready for an even
bigger stage.

665
00:29:12.293 --> 00:29:14.921
- As you talk about
bringing Bray Wyatt

666
00:29:14.963 --> 00:29:18.091
and the family up to Raw
or to SmackDown and up

667
00:29:18.133 --> 00:29:19.926
into the big show.
now. how do you

668
00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:22.262
take that.
put that into an arena?

669
00:29:22.303 --> 00:29:23.430
Let me talk to you
'cause I want you

670
00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:24.681
to understand
the psychology of it.

671
00:29:24.723 --> 00:29:25.765
- Let's go right now.
I'm ready.

672
00:29:25.807 --> 00:29:27.017
- It's subtle.

673
00:29:27.058 --> 00:29:28.560
That's where the lantern
came to be.

674
00:29:28.601 --> 00:29:30.770
I think. when I threw it
at him. he loved--

675
00:29:30.812 --> 00:29:32.313
like. all the lights
should go out

676
00:29:32.355 --> 00:29:34.899
and this creepy ass dude
comes out

677
00:29:34.941 --> 00:29:36.818
of the swamp holding a lantern.

678
00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.903
And just slightly
beneath your face.

679
00:29:38.945 --> 00:29:40.572
But it would give me
enough light to see that.

680
00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:43.575
Those were the things that
we sort of collaborated on

681
00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:46.036
a lot and put
the character together.

682
00:29:46.077 --> 00:29:48.705
- That's fun. I like that.

683
00:29:48.747 --> 00:29:53.293
- In the summer of 2013.
Bray Wyatt was ready

684
00:29:53.335 --> 00:29:55.628
to make his debut
on the national stage.

685
00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.130
[dramatic music]

686
00:29:57.172 --> 00:29:59.257
- This is Monday Night Raw.

687
00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:03.970
The WWE fans in Baltimore
are on their feet.

688
00:30:04.012 --> 00:30:05.722
- We finally got the call-up.

689
00:30:05.764 --> 00:30:09.809
And I don't know if we really
understood what we had.

690
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:13.855
We knew the "NXT" crowd had
responded so well to us.

691
00:30:13.897 --> 00:30:15.607
We never in
a million years thought

692
00:30:15.648 --> 00:30:18.818
it was going to explode
the way it did.

693
00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.528
We're here.

694
00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:28.578
[dramatic music]

695
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:30.663
- [roaring. grunting]

696
00:30:30.705 --> 00:30:32.749
- Bray Wyatt's emergence
on Monday Night Raw

697
00:30:32.791 --> 00:30:36.002
as the leader of
the cult-like Wyatt Family

698
00:30:36.044 --> 00:30:41.675
was unlike anything the WWE
Universe had seen before.

699
00:30:41.716 --> 00:30:44.135
- He was just such
a captivating talker.

700
00:30:44.177 --> 00:30:47.013
And he was doing stuff
that no one else was doing.

701
00:30:47.055 --> 00:30:49.224
Because in wrestling.
you get so much bombast

702
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:51.685
and you're taught to. like.
play to the nosebleeds.

703
00:30:51.726 --> 00:30:54.646
But the way he could just
deliver something very softly

704
00:30:54.688 --> 00:30:56.856
and it would. like.
send chills up your spine--

705
00:30:56.898 --> 00:30:58.858
- Tomorrow morning
when you wake up.

706
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.944
you go back to being
just another one

707
00:31:00.985 --> 00:31:03.530
of those anonymous souls.

708
00:31:03.571 --> 00:31:04.989
[laughs]

709
00:31:05.031 --> 00:31:06.533
- That stuff. I think.
was mesmerizing.

710
00:31:06.574 --> 00:31:09.536
And in many ways. he's
portraying this cult leader.

711
00:31:09.577 --> 00:31:10.787
but it almost felt real.

712
00:31:10.829 --> 00:31:13.581
Like. he was gathering
people's interest.

713
00:31:13.623 --> 00:31:16.251
- He put his whole heart
and soul into that character.

714
00:31:16.292 --> 00:31:19.045
And that transcended through
the camera and on TV.

715
00:31:19.087 --> 00:31:20.130
And you could feel it.

716
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:23.133
all: This is awesome!

717
00:31:23.174 --> 00:31:26.636
- It was eerie. but you
knew that it was special

718
00:31:26.678 --> 00:31:29.556
because it felt almost
like a movie character.

719
00:31:29.597 --> 00:31:31.266
It felt like you were
watching something

720
00:31:31.307 --> 00:31:33.184
that shouldn't be in
professional wrestling--

721
00:31:33.226 --> 00:31:34.769
that didn't fit.

722
00:31:34.811 --> 00:31:36.646
- Oh. my God!

723
00:31:36.688 --> 00:31:39.399
- It was very interesting
to watch him create something

724
00:31:39.441 --> 00:31:42.068
that made sense in our world.

725
00:31:43.903 --> 00:31:46.489
- As soon as I saw Bray Wyatt
and the Wyatt Family.

726
00:31:46.531 --> 00:31:49.993
I was instantly
connected to it.

727
00:31:50.035 --> 00:31:56.041
I've always loved characters
that have this darkness to it.

728
00:31:56.082 --> 00:32:00.628
but a darkness that
is there for a reason.

729
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.882
- Within a few months.
Bray Wyatt was

730
00:32:03.923 --> 00:32:09.387
vaulted into a rivalry
with a top star. John Cena.

731
00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:12.307
- I could be just like you.

732
00:32:12.349 --> 00:32:16.227
I could sign autographs
and kiss babies

733
00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:20.315
and make sure that everyone
buys all my merchandise.

734
00:32:20.357 --> 00:32:24.319
- The main focus of Bray
Wyatt's character was chaos.

735
00:32:24.361 --> 00:32:28.406
- I am different than
anyone you will ever face.

736
00:32:28.448 --> 00:32:30.450
- The ability
to just be a person

737
00:32:30.492 --> 00:32:32.827
that wants to see
the world burn.

738
00:32:32.869 --> 00:32:35.413
And man. when you
start breaking down

739
00:32:35.455 --> 00:32:38.750
the stuff he was saying.
it's. like. super deep.

740
00:32:38.792 --> 00:32:43.129
- The loneliest man on Earth
is the man who sits alone

741
00:32:43.171 --> 00:32:46.466
atop his empty castle.

742
00:32:46.508 --> 00:32:49.969
Who will be left for you. John?

743
00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:52.263
- But he was so entertaining
that if you didn't take

744
00:32:52.305 --> 00:32:54.140
anything away from it. cool.

745
00:32:54.182 --> 00:32:56.101
And if you wanted
to dive in the rabbit hole.

746
00:32:56.142 --> 00:32:58.103
you were going
to some weird places.

747
00:32:58.144 --> 00:32:59.646
- [laughs]

748
00:32:59.688 --> 00:33:01.773
all: This is awesome!

749
00:33:01.815 --> 00:33:04.943
- So it was like. holy shit.
we got something here.

750
00:33:04.984 --> 00:33:09.447
- At WrestleMania.
John Cena takes on Bray Wyatt.

751
00:33:09.489 --> 00:33:15.245
- Windham had made it
to the big time. WrestleMania.

752
00:33:15.286 --> 00:33:18.665
- New Orleans.
a weird voodoo-based town

753
00:33:18.707 --> 00:33:21.793
to get the WrestleMania
debut of Bray Wyatt.

754
00:33:21.835 --> 00:33:23.461
It really was special.

755
00:33:23.503 --> 00:33:25.588
- We all had dreams and goals.

756
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.882
And me and Windham talked
about them endlessly.

757
00:33:27.924 --> 00:33:30.927
You know. like. if we can
make it to WrestleMania

758
00:33:30.969 --> 00:33:34.556
and get a match on that
platform. then we had made it.

759
00:33:34.597 --> 00:33:37.767
- * You could find him in *

760
00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:39.519
- We all knew
he was going to get there.

761
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:43.189
but we didn't know he was
going to get there that fast.

762
00:33:43.231 --> 00:33:46.818
- To see him go
from the lowest of lows

763
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:50.405
to figuring out who he was.
catching fire.

764
00:33:50.447 --> 00:33:52.157
and then working with
one of the greatest

765
00:33:52.198 --> 00:33:54.284
of all time. John Cena.
at WrestleMania.

766
00:33:54.325 --> 00:33:55.702
I mean.
it's an incredible story.

767
00:33:55.744 --> 00:33:57.871
and especially in such
a short period of time.

768
00:33:57.912 --> 00:33:59.205
- And here we go.

769
00:33:59.247 --> 00:34:00.957
This much-anticipated
match underway.

770
00:34:00.999 --> 00:34:02.375
Oh! Wow.

771
00:34:02.417 --> 00:34:04.377
- Growing up watching our dad

772
00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:05.378
and watching our uncles

773
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.005
and watching our grandfather.

774
00:34:07.047 --> 00:34:09.716
the grandest stage of all
is going to be WrestleMania.

775
00:34:09.758 --> 00:34:13.386
And I remember sitting there
going. that's my big brother.

776
00:34:13.428 --> 00:34:15.430
- Bray Wyatt is trying
to sway the masses.

777
00:34:15.472 --> 00:34:16.806
and I'm not sure
it's not working.

778
00:34:16.848 --> 00:34:19.351
- The shepherd leading his
flock.

779
00:34:19.392 --> 00:34:20.769
- We were all excited for him.

780
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.563
And even Mike and I
were just. wow.

781
00:34:23.605 --> 00:34:24.898
Wow.

782
00:34:24.939 --> 00:34:26.983
Because it's your kid.
and it's. you know.

783
00:34:27.025 --> 00:34:28.068
that was the first time

784
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:29.569
I saw him bigger than life.

785
00:34:29.611 --> 00:34:31.237
- Cena. second rope.
Caught by Wyatt!

786
00:34:31.279 --> 00:34:32.572
Oh! That could be it!

787
00:34:32.614 --> 00:34:33.990
- What an impact!
- Shoulders are down!

788
00:34:34.032 --> 00:34:35.116
- Kick out in two.

789
00:34:35.158 --> 00:34:37.577
- I was very happy for him.

790
00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:40.288
It's a good feeling
in your heart as a parent

791
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:44.584
to see your kid work really
hard and get rewarded for it.

792
00:34:44.626 --> 00:34:46.711
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa.

793
00:34:46.753 --> 00:34:48.213
That stopped Cena
in his tracks.

794
00:34:48.254 --> 00:34:49.631
- What is that?

795
00:34:49.673 --> 00:34:52.008
- I've never seen a match
quite like this.

796
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.803
- 20 years from now.
they'll go. wow. this moment

797
00:34:54.844 --> 00:34:56.805
happened with John.

798
00:34:56.846 --> 00:35:00.225
That's what I'm
looking forward to.

799
00:35:00.266 --> 00:35:01.726
- AA for Cena.

800
00:35:01.768 --> 00:35:02.852
Hook of the leg.

801
00:35:02.894 --> 00:35:06.523
John Cena's legacy grows.

802
00:35:06.564 --> 00:35:09.609
- It was spectacular.

803
00:35:09.651 --> 00:35:11.277
I'm an advocate
for. it takes 10 years

804
00:35:11.319 --> 00:35:12.779
to establish sort of fluency.

805
00:35:12.821 --> 00:35:16.408
And I know Husky Harris didn't
work out. but holy shit.

806
00:35:16.449 --> 00:35:19.536
When he came back. it was like
fluency in six months.

807
00:35:19.577 --> 00:35:23.039
That is a meteoric rise.

808
00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:24.624
- An incredible scene.

809
00:35:24.666 --> 00:35:27.043
And the sea of Fireflies--
what Bray Wyatt

810
00:35:27.085 --> 00:35:29.671
calls his followers--
lighting the arena.

811
00:35:31.047 --> 00:35:34.968
[soft music]

812
00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:37.470
- The lantern. to me. is like--
this is one of the many things

813
00:35:37.512 --> 00:35:39.014
I loved about your brother
is that

814
00:35:39.055 --> 00:35:41.307
he could make anything iconic.

815
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:42.642
- And this one's. like.
the first one too.

816
00:35:42.684 --> 00:35:43.852
So it was much simpler.
- Yeah.

817
00:35:43.893 --> 00:35:46.229
This is it.
This is the very first one.

818
00:35:46.271 --> 00:35:48.398
* *

819
00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.569
- Looking at this.
it reminds me

820
00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:55.113
of the birth of the Fireflies.

821
00:35:55.155 --> 00:35:57.240
Like...

822
00:35:57.282 --> 00:36:00.201
to see that as
it was happening was--

823
00:36:04.497 --> 00:36:06.207
I have a memory--

824
00:36:06.249 --> 00:36:07.584
it was Madison Square Garden--

825
00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:09.627
and I got to see his entrance.

826
00:36:11.713 --> 00:36:13.298
And...

827
00:36:16.426 --> 00:36:17.969
- I mean.
because that's it. right?

828
00:36:18.011 --> 00:36:19.179
Madison Square Garden is the--

829
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.264
- It's something
I'll never forget.

830
00:36:21.306 --> 00:36:25.185
To look out...

831
00:36:25.226 --> 00:36:30.065
and see the sea of lights.

832
00:36:30.106 --> 00:36:34.694
* *

833
00:36:34.736 --> 00:36:38.531
The Fireflies. we had
never seen before in WWE.

834
00:36:38.573 --> 00:36:42.577
And I don't know
if we'll ever see it again.

835
00:36:44.996 --> 00:36:46.873
[tense music]

836
00:36:46.915 --> 00:36:48.416
- We're here.

837
00:36:49.209 --> 00:36:51.878
It was created by
the fans on their own.

838
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.047
You know. they call
themselves the Fireflies.

839
00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:55.590
And it became their own thing.

840
00:36:55.632 --> 00:36:56.966
And now it's become
a spectacle.

841
00:36:57.008 --> 00:36:59.219
Like. almost a piece
of what you pay

842
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.637
to come see at a WWE show

843
00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:02.263
is the Wyatt entrance.

844
00:37:02.305 --> 00:37:07.602
- When you get is not just
typical fan participation.

845
00:37:07.644 --> 00:37:10.105
You get this idea that
everything this character

846
00:37:10.146 --> 00:37:11.898
is saying is true.

847
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.401
Because every little light
that is around

848
00:37:14.442 --> 00:37:15.985
this darkened arena

849
00:37:16.027 --> 00:37:18.780
represents somebody
that's buying in

850
00:37:18.822 --> 00:37:22.617
to whatever this malicious
character is selling.

851
00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:24.077
- He just found a niche.

852
00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:26.955
And finding a niche
is a really hard thing to do.

853
00:37:26.996 --> 00:37:29.749
you know. and make it
last for a while.

854
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:32.210
- The matches. the promos.
all of it's

855
00:37:32.252 --> 00:37:36.214
just avenues that we take to do
what we're really doing here.

856
00:37:36.256 --> 00:37:37.716
which is connect
with the audience.

857
00:37:37.757 --> 00:37:38.883
That's it.

858
00:37:38.925 --> 00:37:40.677
So if you find a way
to do that.

859
00:37:40.719 --> 00:37:41.928
that's your ticket.

860
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.388
That's how you climb
the ladder.

861
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.515
And he clearly did.

862
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.355
[indistinct chatter]

863
00:37:52.397 --> 00:37:54.941
- When people would approach
him. they wanted to meet Bray.

864
00:37:54.983 --> 00:37:58.486
And Windham gave them who
he was and he took his time.

865
00:37:58.528 --> 00:37:59.738
- Would you like anything else?

866
00:37:59.779 --> 00:38:01.156
Oh. is this for me?
- Yeah.

867
00:38:01.197 --> 00:38:02.323
- Oh. thank you.

868
00:38:02.365 --> 00:38:03.408
- I appreciate
everything you do.

869
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:04.826
- Thank you very much.

870
00:38:04.868 --> 00:38:06.244
- Whatever you have
going on in your life.

871
00:38:06.286 --> 00:38:07.579
it matters to me.

872
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.664
Even if we have
a five-minute interaction.

873
00:38:09.706 --> 00:38:11.499
whatever you want to tell me
is important to me

874
00:38:11.541 --> 00:38:13.293
and I'm going to
genuinely listen.

875
00:38:13.335 --> 00:38:14.711
And when I walk away from you.

876
00:38:14.753 --> 00:38:16.296
I'm going to leave you
better than I found you.

877
00:38:16.338 --> 00:38:17.756
- [laughs]

878
00:38:26.973 --> 00:38:28.016
- Thank you.

879
00:38:28.058 --> 00:38:31.227
- Ready? 1. 2. 3.

880
00:38:31.269 --> 00:38:33.313
- He's my favorite wrestler
of all time.

881
00:38:33.355 --> 00:38:36.024
I'm still shaking.

882
00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:37.108
Love you. Bray.

883
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:38.526
Don't forget your autograph.

884
00:38:39.361 --> 00:38:40.528
- Everything. You really are.

885
00:38:41.446 --> 00:38:42.697
- He just had it.

886
00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:45.575
And not only it.
he had everything else

887
00:38:45.617 --> 00:38:46.618
to go along with that.

888
00:38:46.659 --> 00:38:47.660
- I'm blessed to be here.

889
00:38:47.702 --> 00:38:48.912
- Nice to meet you.

890
00:38:48.953 --> 00:38:49.996
All right. man.

891
00:38:51.748 --> 00:38:53.500
- I don't think
I've ever seen anyone

892
00:38:53.541 --> 00:38:56.336
so committed
to being a character.

893
00:38:56.378 --> 00:38:59.214
And when he was Bray Wyatt.

894
00:38:59.255 --> 00:39:01.716
I don't know if anyone
was more believable.

895
00:39:01.758 --> 00:39:04.010
I don't know if anyone
immersed you as much.

896
00:39:04.052 --> 00:39:07.555
if anyone made you believe
as much as he did.

897
00:39:07.597 --> 00:39:09.641
He was just one of
the most cerebral performers

898
00:39:09.683 --> 00:39:12.310
I think that I'd ever met
because his preparation

899
00:39:12.352 --> 00:39:13.353
was so real.

900
00:39:13.395 --> 00:39:15.021
- And action.

901
00:39:15.063 --> 00:39:16.815
- I'm here.

902
00:39:16.856 --> 00:39:19.359
You're here.

903
00:39:19.401 --> 00:39:21.403
We're all here.

904
00:39:22.737 --> 00:39:25.532
- I remember being in
the backstage one time.

905
00:39:25.573 --> 00:39:28.952
And as I'm walking past.
I see. like. Windham

906
00:39:28.993 --> 00:39:31.496
out of the corner
of my eye like this

907
00:39:31.538 --> 00:39:33.915
up to the wall in
this little alcove.

908
00:39:33.957 --> 00:39:36.251
And he's just going over his
promo and going over his promo

909
00:39:36.292 --> 00:39:38.003
and going over his promo.

910
00:39:38.044 --> 00:39:41.047
And I remember thinking.
wow. I wish I could

911
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:44.676
have that type of focus
and that type of dedication

912
00:39:44.718 --> 00:39:48.138
and that type of commitment
to the character.

913
00:39:48.179 --> 00:39:51.057
He's such a creative guy.

914
00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:54.602
- Windham's commitment
to his craft caught my eye.

915
00:39:54.644 --> 00:39:56.354
I knew this kid was special.

916
00:39:56.396 --> 00:40:00.900
And the time was right
for us to meet in the ring.

917
00:40:00.942 --> 00:40:02.861
- When I got that message
that I was

918
00:40:02.902 --> 00:40:05.405
going to have the luxury
and the privilege of competing

919
00:40:05.447 --> 00:40:07.824
against the Undertaker
at WrestleMania.

920
00:40:07.866 --> 00:40:09.826
I was immediately
like. oh. my God.

921
00:40:09.868 --> 00:40:14.080
I am Bray Wyatt.
the new face of fear!

922
00:40:14.122 --> 00:40:16.708
And then I remember
he was in the room.

923
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.918
And I remember him kind of--

924
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.920
you know.
when he does his finger.

925
00:40:20.962 --> 00:40:24.382
[laughs] And he called me in.

926
00:40:24.424 --> 00:40:26.426
And he sat me down real calm.

927
00:40:26.468 --> 00:40:29.471
And he was like.
are you ready to do this?

928
00:40:29.512 --> 00:40:34.059
And like. you know.
I'm like. yeah.

929
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.311
This is everything
I've ever trained for.

930
00:40:36.353 --> 00:40:38.772
Of course I'm ready for this.

931
00:40:38.813 --> 00:40:41.649
- It will be a night
forever etched in history

932
00:40:41.691 --> 00:40:45.028
and legends will be born.

933
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.572
- It was huge.

934
00:40:47.614 --> 00:40:49.616
Nobody can touch
the Undertaker.

935
00:40:49.657 --> 00:40:52.619
I mean. he had his
action figures.

936
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.245
- You think Bray Wyatt
might be having

937
00:40:54.287 --> 00:40:55.747
second thoughts right now?

938
00:40:55.789 --> 00:40:57.540
- I enjoyed it because
it's like watching

939
00:40:57.582 --> 00:41:02.712
the Freddy versus Jason live
or Godzilla versus King Kong.

940
00:41:02.754 --> 00:41:04.756
- Bray Wyatt wanted
to dance with the devil?

941
00:41:04.798 --> 00:41:06.508
Welcome to hell.

942
00:41:12.305 --> 00:41:14.974
- That night on
the grandest stage.

943
00:41:15.016 --> 00:41:18.603
Windham proved he was
a legend in the making.

944
00:41:18.645 --> 00:41:20.271
[dramatic music]

945
00:41:20.313 --> 00:41:23.108
- That. indeed. is
the new face of fear.

946
00:41:23.149 --> 00:41:25.694
- That WrestleMania match
did more for me

947
00:41:25.735 --> 00:41:28.154
than I could ever
put into words.

948
00:41:28.196 --> 00:41:29.948
- Oh. what a WrestleMania
moment!

949
00:41:29.989 --> 00:41:32.826
- At that time. I was
struggling with my confidence.

950
00:41:32.867 --> 00:41:34.953
And that night.
Windham helped restore

951
00:41:34.994 --> 00:41:36.663
not only the Undertaker...

952
00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:40.375
- The Undertaker did it!

953
00:41:40.417 --> 00:41:42.752
- But Mark Calaway. as well.

954
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.255
- He's like your father.

955
00:41:45.296 --> 00:41:47.841
And he is responsible
for so much

956
00:41:47.882 --> 00:41:49.676
of the progression
of this business.

957
00:41:49.718 --> 00:41:51.011
You know. not just in the ring.

958
00:41:51.052 --> 00:41:53.013
but what he did
behind the stages

959
00:41:53.054 --> 00:41:57.809
to kind of show everyone
and lead by his example.

960
00:41:57.851 --> 00:42:03.523
- By 2015. Bray Wyatt
was box office.

961
00:42:03.565 --> 00:42:07.152
And all the while. he was
becoming a trusted mentor

962
00:42:07.193 --> 00:42:08.570
behind the scenes.

963
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.075
- I hadn't been into
the business for too long.

964
00:42:14.117 --> 00:42:17.370
The second he laid eyes on me.
he pulled me off to the side

965
00:42:17.412 --> 00:42:20.790
and he was like. "I want you
to be a part of us.

966
00:42:20.832 --> 00:42:22.792
I don't know how. when. where."

967
00:42:22.834 --> 00:42:27.130
He was like.
"But holy cow. look at you."

968
00:42:27.172 --> 00:42:28.882
- What the--

969
00:42:28.923 --> 00:42:32.427
[cheers and applause]

970
00:42:32.469 --> 00:42:33.845
This guy is a monster.

971
00:42:33.887 --> 00:42:36.514
Look at the size of him.

972
00:42:36.556 --> 00:42:41.811
- From day one. he treated me
like I was like a brother.

973
00:42:41.853 --> 00:42:44.356
He taught me all kinds
of stuff in the ring.

974
00:42:44.397 --> 00:42:47.484
But honestly. like.
I learned more from him about

975
00:42:47.525 --> 00:42:49.486
the real world. I feel like.

976
00:42:49.527 --> 00:42:51.905
You know. him being
a third-generation wrestler.

977
00:42:51.946 --> 00:42:53.239
being in this business.

978
00:42:53.281 --> 00:42:54.783
already been on TV.
established.

979
00:42:54.824 --> 00:42:57.452
and stuff like that.
he'd already navigated

980
00:42:57.494 --> 00:42:59.579
the wolves in the forest.

981
00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:04.542
He was just that guy that just
made sure everyone was happy

982
00:43:04.584 --> 00:43:06.753
and everyone was
well taken care of

983
00:43:06.795 --> 00:43:09.255
and felt like they belonged.

984
00:43:09.297 --> 00:43:11.841
- I remember coming up
and being afraid

985
00:43:11.883 --> 00:43:13.885
and being scared and being
away from home.

986
00:43:13.927 --> 00:43:18.139
And the warmth
and the humility with which

987
00:43:18.181 --> 00:43:22.310
he talked to you like he
was on the same level as you

988
00:43:22.352 --> 00:43:26.231
and with just
no pretenses about him.

989
00:43:26.272 --> 00:43:27.649
- I think he really
loved people.

990
00:43:27.691 --> 00:43:29.984
And I think he loved
positively affecting people.

991
00:43:30.026 --> 00:43:33.446
And he loved seeing people
smile or laugh.

992
00:43:33.488 --> 00:43:35.448
- Even when he was like.
you know. had been on the road

993
00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.951
for two weeks and just wanted
to get home and see his kids.

994
00:43:37.992 --> 00:43:40.537
like. he was still always
in a good mood.

995
00:43:40.578 --> 00:43:46.001
He was just such a pleasure
to be around as a human being.

996
00:43:46.042 --> 00:43:48.169
- Windham's lineage
and the fact that the business

997
00:43:48.211 --> 00:43:53.133
is in his blood. not only was
he this interesting performer.

998
00:43:53.174 --> 00:43:55.051
but he had a lot of respect
for the business.

999
00:43:55.093 --> 00:43:56.469
A lot.

1000
00:43:56.511 --> 00:44:01.141
And he had a lot of camaraderie
with the superstars.

1001
00:44:01.182 --> 00:44:05.311
He was really fun to be around
and always wanted everybody

1002
00:44:05.353 --> 00:44:07.063
to have a good time.

1003
00:44:07.105 --> 00:44:08.898
- He could light up
a room in an instant.

1004
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.984
He was the guy
who was a chameleon.

1005
00:44:11.026 --> 00:44:13.987
He was the guy that everybody
was best friends with.

1006
00:44:14.029 --> 00:44:16.990
He had a certain draw to him.

1007
00:44:17.032 --> 00:44:19.075
- He just had a charisma.
a zest for life.

1008
00:44:19.117 --> 00:44:20.410
Like. you were drawn to him.

1009
00:44:20.452 --> 00:44:21.703
He was a very magnetic person.

1010
00:44:26.708 --> 00:44:30.670
- This is the greatest night
in live entertainment.

1011
00:44:30.712 --> 00:44:33.214
- WrestleMania 32.

1012
00:44:33.256 --> 00:44:36.634
Over 100.000 Fireflies
lit up the sky

1013
00:44:36.676 --> 00:44:40.221
for Bray Wyatt. a spectacle
that was recognized

1014
00:44:40.263 --> 00:44:43.725
by one of the greatest WWE
superstars of all time.

1015
00:44:43.767 --> 00:44:47.896
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

1016
00:44:47.937 --> 00:44:49.189
- The Rock's had his eye on you

1017
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.232
ever since you came
into the WWE.

1018
00:44:51.274 --> 00:44:54.277
You got it all.

1019
00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:56.404
You hold people in the palm
of your hands.

1020
00:44:56.446 --> 00:44:58.323
When the lights went out.
you came down.

1021
00:44:58.365 --> 00:45:00.575
100.000 people had
their phones up.

1022
00:45:00.617 --> 00:45:03.244
100.000 people.

1023
00:45:03.286 --> 00:45:05.372
- He was almost bulletproof
at that point.

1024
00:45:05.413 --> 00:45:08.041
I never saw him exhibit
any nerves

1025
00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:10.669
as he's lining up
for these huge main events.

1026
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:13.213
You simply couldn't
take your eyes off him.

1027
00:45:13.254 --> 00:45:15.882
- After four years
on the main roster.

1028
00:45:15.924 --> 00:45:22.097
there was a milestone that
Bray Wyatt had yet to achieve.

1029
00:45:22.138 --> 00:45:24.224
- When everything
is said and done.

1030
00:45:24.265 --> 00:45:30.522
I will be leaving
the new WWE champion!

1031
00:45:30.563 --> 00:45:31.773
- Phenomenal form.

1032
00:45:31.815 --> 00:45:33.692
No. it's blocked by Wyatt.

1033
00:45:33.733 --> 00:45:36.611
Sister Abigail on AJ Styles.

1034
00:45:36.653 --> 00:45:38.571
- One. two. three!

1035
00:45:38.613 --> 00:45:42.534
[cheers and applause]

1036
00:45:42.575 --> 00:45:44.536
- Bray Wyatt has done it.

1037
00:45:44.577 --> 00:45:48.248
In the soul-stealing structure
known as the Elimination

1038
00:45:48.289 --> 00:45:52.460
Chamber. Bray Wyatt has won
his first WWE Championship.

1039
00:45:54.462 --> 00:45:57.674
- The company had put their
stamp on him and said.

1040
00:45:57.716 --> 00:45:59.259
this is going to be our guy.

1041
00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.804
I mean. there's not
many better feelings

1042
00:46:02.846 --> 00:46:06.975
from a performer's perspective
when you finally get that.

1043
00:46:07.017 --> 00:46:10.311
- In this hellacious match.
Bray Wyatt rose from the ashes

1044
00:46:10.353 --> 00:46:13.106
to taste the ultimate glory.

1045
00:46:13.148 --> 00:46:17.110
The era of Wyatt is here.

1046
00:46:17.152 --> 00:46:19.446
- He was the first
in the family to win.

1047
00:46:19.487 --> 00:46:22.991
which is pretty good
considering your grandfather

1048
00:46:23.033 --> 00:46:25.910
did it. your uncles did it.
your dad did it.

1049
00:46:25.952 --> 00:46:27.037
And you were the first.

1050
00:46:27.078 --> 00:46:28.913
So that's cool.

1051
00:46:28.955 --> 00:46:31.458
- Out of all of us.
that I'm the one that did it--

1052
00:46:31.499 --> 00:46:34.294
my whole entire life.
no matter what accolade.

1053
00:46:34.336 --> 00:46:36.838
what thing I did great.
the first paragraph

1054
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.631
was about everyone else
in my family

1055
00:46:38.673 --> 00:46:40.800
that was not me and all
the things they had done.

1056
00:46:40.842 --> 00:46:44.179
And now it's like. when you
look at anything about them.

1057
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.140
it's a whole paragraph
about me.

1058
00:46:47.182 --> 00:46:48.933
- When you're working
with talent.

1059
00:46:48.975 --> 00:46:50.352
you form a bond with them

1060
00:46:50.393 --> 00:46:52.145
and you know the human being
behind it

1061
00:46:52.187 --> 00:46:54.898
and you know how hard
they work at it.

1062
00:46:54.939 --> 00:46:59.527
Windham winning a title that
had eluded his entire family.

1063
00:46:59.569 --> 00:47:02.072
that was so special.

1064
00:47:02.113 --> 00:47:03.198
- I was there.

1065
00:47:03.239 --> 00:47:05.116
It was huge. I cried.

1066
00:47:05.158 --> 00:47:08.203
It was very. very cool.

1067
00:47:08.244 --> 00:47:10.121
- If I go back and look
at the landscape

1068
00:47:10.163 --> 00:47:14.084
of my life and my career here.
the ridiculously hard times

1069
00:47:14.125 --> 00:47:16.169
are kind of what
strengthened me.

1070
00:47:16.211 --> 00:47:18.338
I knew that sooner
or later I'd get to it.

1071
00:47:18.380 --> 00:47:22.008
it was just a matter
of how and when.

1072
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:23.176
- It was huge for him.

1073
00:47:23.218 --> 00:47:24.427
Getting on top was one thing.

1074
00:47:24.469 --> 00:47:26.137
To stay there...

1075
00:47:28.848 --> 00:47:31.893
- Being on top means
numerous appearances.

1076
00:47:31.935 --> 00:47:37.732
new responsibilities.
and more time away from home.

1077
00:47:37.774 --> 00:47:41.319
- Me and Bray were very close.
especially for that stint.

1078
00:47:41.361 --> 00:47:43.863
We were working
so closely together

1079
00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:45.448
and we were really
telling some good stories

1080
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:47.534
and having a lot of fun on TV.

1081
00:47:47.575 --> 00:47:49.619
- I feel like we're shooting
a [bleep] movie

1082
00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:50.829
for SyFy channel right now.

1083
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:52.122
[laughter]

1084
00:47:52.163 --> 00:47:53.873
- But being on the road.
it's tough.

1085
00:47:53.915 --> 00:47:57.544
When guys start having kids
and we get a little older.

1086
00:47:57.585 --> 00:48:00.255
you know. things change.

1087
00:48:00.296 --> 00:48:02.882
It's very hard to balance.
especially when

1088
00:48:02.924 --> 00:48:04.300
you're a young man.

1089
00:48:04.342 --> 00:48:08.638
The work and home life
balance. if you will.

1090
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.850
It's virtually impossible.

1091
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:14.060
- Oh! RKO!

1092
00:48:14.102 --> 00:48:16.980
Randy Orton is champion!

1093
00:48:17.022 --> 00:48:19.107
[tense music]

1094
00:48:19.149 --> 00:48:23.403
- It was just after
WrestleMania in Orlando.

1095
00:48:23.445 --> 00:48:27.240
Things were not
what they used to be.

1096
00:48:27.282 --> 00:48:29.534
He was on the road
and traveling

1097
00:48:29.576 --> 00:48:31.578
and I was at home
with the kids.

1098
00:48:31.619 --> 00:48:35.832
And we ultimately
got divorced.

1099
00:48:35.874 --> 00:48:39.627
Our lives just grew apart.

1100
00:48:39.669 --> 00:48:43.673
- He was absent.

1101
00:48:43.715 --> 00:48:46.009
Mind. body. and soul.

1102
00:48:46.051 --> 00:48:50.096
The divorce in that time of his
life was a devastating ordeal.

1103
00:48:50.138 --> 00:48:53.433
[somber music]

1104
00:48:53.475 --> 00:48:58.146
- Windham's frustrations
affected his focus.

1105
00:48:58.188 --> 00:48:59.898
- So. guys. remember
long at the beginning.

1106
00:48:59.939 --> 00:49:01.107
- Just [bleep]--let's go.

1107
00:49:01.149 --> 00:49:03.318
- Yep. In five.

1108
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.571
- Windham was very emotionally
attached to his work.

1109
00:49:06.613 --> 00:49:09.449
When things went great.
they were great.

1110
00:49:09.491 --> 00:49:12.452
And when they went not so great
and they were frustrating.

1111
00:49:12.494 --> 00:49:15.789
they were exaggeratedly
frustrated.

1112
00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:17.999
- You going to cut me?

1113
00:49:18.041 --> 00:49:21.628
- Sometimes the hardest thing
to talk him into was. OK. yeah.

1114
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.880
but how do we make that work
in the ring?

1115
00:49:23.922 --> 00:49:26.007
I get it. That shit is crazy.

1116
00:49:26.049 --> 00:49:27.342
It seems genius.

1117
00:49:27.384 --> 00:49:29.761
It's like. man.
I'm intrigued by that.

1118
00:49:29.803 --> 00:49:32.305
OK. But now. ding ding.

1119
00:49:32.347 --> 00:49:34.265
And that was
sometimes the trick.

1120
00:49:34.307 --> 00:49:37.394
He was so creative
and so outside the box

1121
00:49:37.435 --> 00:49:40.230
that pulling it back
into a particular genre

1122
00:49:40.271 --> 00:49:42.774
was hard for him to do.

1123
00:49:42.816 --> 00:49:45.193
- While Windham's brother
Taylor was finding success

1124
00:49:45.235 --> 00:49:50.615
as a WWE tag team champion.
Bray's on-screen Wyatt family

1125
00:49:50.657 --> 00:49:54.494
was no more.

1126
00:49:54.536 --> 00:49:56.538
- Harper and Rowan
had branched off

1127
00:49:56.579 --> 00:49:57.872
and become a tag team
on their own

1128
00:49:57.914 --> 00:49:59.874
called The Bludgeon Brothers.

1129
00:49:59.916 --> 00:50:01.793
Braun Strowman had become

1130
00:50:01.835 --> 00:50:04.754
a bona fide
main-event superstar.

1131
00:50:04.796 --> 00:50:07.716
The Bray Wyatt character
kind of found himself

1132
00:50:07.757 --> 00:50:10.802
in a neutral position.

1133
00:50:10.844 --> 00:50:14.180
He was on TV. but he wasn't
really prominently featured.

1134
00:50:18.643 --> 00:50:20.437
- When I was working
with Harper and Rowan

1135
00:50:20.478 --> 00:50:22.397
doing the Bludgeon Brothers
stuff.

1136
00:50:22.439 --> 00:50:24.816
he'd come and check it out
and give the classic. like.

1137
00:50:24.858 --> 00:50:26.526
oh. baby.

1138
00:50:26.568 --> 00:50:28.361
Oh. you guys look good. Sexy.

1139
00:50:28.403 --> 00:50:30.363
You know. cracking jokes.

1140
00:50:30.405 --> 00:50:33.199
But you'd see every time
he'd see something artistic

1141
00:50:33.241 --> 00:50:35.035
and creative--like.
we'd make these things

1142
00:50:35.076 --> 00:50:36.369
for Harper and Rowan--

1143
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:38.288
he'd be like. oh. I want that.

1144
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:39.622
What can I do?

1145
00:50:39.664 --> 00:50:40.749
And you'd see the gears
start turning.

1146
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:42.167
- And that's the thing
with Windham.

1147
00:50:42.208 --> 00:50:44.377
And like you said.
this was around 2018.

1148
00:50:44.419 --> 00:50:47.088
And behind the scenes.
there was a lot

1149
00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.548
going on in Windham's life.

1150
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:51.468
And a normal person.
with everything

1151
00:50:51.509 --> 00:50:54.596
that he was dealing with.
could have let everything go

1152
00:50:54.637 --> 00:50:56.639
and kind of lost
the grip of it all.

1153
00:50:56.681 --> 00:51:01.269
But he's always been able
to find inspiration

1154
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:04.147
in places I don't think
anybody else could.

1155
00:51:05.857 --> 00:51:08.443
- As Windham dealt
with the stress.

1156
00:51:08.485 --> 00:51:10.987
he leaned on his friends.

1157
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:15.241
- We were together four
or five days a week.

1158
00:51:15.283 --> 00:51:16.326
We cried together.

1159
00:51:16.368 --> 00:51:17.410
We laughed together.

1160
00:51:17.452 --> 00:51:19.913
We did everything together.

1161
00:51:19.954 --> 00:51:22.207
The WWE. it's such a family.

1162
00:51:22.248 --> 00:51:23.416
It really is.

1163
00:51:23.458 --> 00:51:24.709
Like. we're all
together so much.

1164
00:51:24.751 --> 00:51:26.336
We're all away from our
families and stuff

1165
00:51:26.378 --> 00:51:29.172
like that--
our real blood families.

1166
00:51:29.214 --> 00:51:31.299
We all have a really cool
relationship.

1167
00:51:34.302 --> 00:51:35.679
- My name is JoJo.

1168
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:39.474
And originally.
I started off as a wrestler.

1169
00:51:39.516 --> 00:51:44.604
And then I transitioned into
a role of the ring announcer.

1170
00:51:44.646 --> 00:51:47.357
The following
No Holds Barred match

1171
00:51:47.399 --> 00:51:51.319
will begin in Bray Wyatt's
House of Horrors.

1172
00:51:51.361 --> 00:51:53.321
We respected
each other's work.

1173
00:51:53.363 --> 00:51:57.283
And we slowly became really.
really great friends

1174
00:51:57.325 --> 00:51:59.911
through that time.

1175
00:51:59.953 --> 00:52:05.000
And so when we were both
able to. we started dating.

1176
00:52:05.041 --> 00:52:08.294
- I lived with JoJo
when I was in "NXT."

1177
00:52:08.336 --> 00:52:12.132
I never pictured JoJo
and Windham together.

1178
00:52:12.173 --> 00:52:13.466
Not for a single second.

1179
00:52:13.508 --> 00:52:15.593
Like. it never dawned on me.

1180
00:52:15.635 --> 00:52:18.888
But then you see them together
and you're like. oh. yeah.

1181
00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:20.265
Oh. that makes sense.

1182
00:52:20.306 --> 00:52:24.060
They're just these two
beautiful souls.

1183
00:52:24.102 --> 00:52:27.439
- JoJo made Windham happy.
and that's all

1184
00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.816
you can ask for is
to be happy in this world.

1185
00:52:29.858 --> 00:52:31.526
you know?

1186
00:52:31.568 --> 00:52:34.821
- It's just that old saying.
you can't fight fate.

1187
00:52:34.863 --> 00:52:37.282
And I think fate was just--
it just took a little while

1188
00:52:37.323 --> 00:52:38.825
for them to find each other.

1189
00:52:38.867 --> 00:52:43.830
- He loved her so much
and she meant the world to him.

1190
00:52:43.872 --> 00:52:46.791
[light guitar music]

1191
00:52:46.833 --> 00:52:48.001
* *

1192
00:52:48.043 --> 00:52:51.671
- In 2019. Windham
and JoJo welcomed

1193
00:52:51.713 --> 00:52:57.469
their first child.
a son. Knash.

1194
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:59.095
- When we found out
it was a boy--

1195
00:52:59.137 --> 00:53:01.681
[laughs] He was so happy.

1196
00:53:01.723 --> 00:53:03.808
He goes. "I didn't think
I could have boys.

1197
00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:07.228
I thought I was destined
for girls my whole life."

1198
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:11.858
- Knash boy is the sweetest
little human

1199
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.109
that I've ever met.

1200
00:53:13.151 --> 00:53:14.486
He looks more like JoJo.

1201
00:53:14.527 --> 00:53:17.489
but he has Windham's
personality.

1202
00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:22.660
- Two years later. they would
welcome a little girl. Hyrie.

1203
00:53:22.702 --> 00:53:23.953
- We got the yin and yang.

1204
00:53:23.995 --> 00:53:26.706
We've got the one that's
Windham. the firstborn.

1205
00:53:26.748 --> 00:53:30.835
And then the second one
is just full of fire.

1206
00:53:30.877 --> 00:53:32.921
- One of the things that I
loved the most about Windham

1207
00:53:32.962 --> 00:53:38.259
in general was how wonderful
a father he always was.

1208
00:53:38.301 --> 00:53:39.928
- Just going over
to their house.

1209
00:53:39.969 --> 00:53:42.639
it was like a scene
out of a movie.

1210
00:53:42.681 --> 00:53:46.434
Just loud and happy always.

1211
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:52.107
- She changed his life
for the better.

1212
00:53:52.148 --> 00:53:55.235
all: * Happy birthday to you *

1213
00:53:55.276 --> 00:53:56.361
- Yay!

1214
00:53:56.403 --> 00:53:57.529
Time to blow this out.

1215
00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:58.780
- Blow it out.
- Make a wish.

1216
00:53:58.822 --> 00:54:01.783
[laughter]

1217
00:54:03.952 --> 00:54:06.663
- Yay!

1218
00:54:06.705 --> 00:54:09.874
- Windham's happiness
inspired his creative side.

1219
00:54:09.916 --> 00:54:13.628
By early 2019.
the idea for a new character

1220
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:16.423
started to develop.

1221
00:54:16.464 --> 00:54:19.926
- He always joked about how
every time he's had a child.

1222
00:54:19.968 --> 00:54:24.014
it boosted his confidence
to come back even harder.

1223
00:54:24.055 --> 00:54:25.598
So we would be at home.

1224
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:29.019
And we're laying in bed
and he's like.

1225
00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:31.062
"So I have this idea."

1226
00:54:34.941 --> 00:54:39.612
- Windham's journey took him
to Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania.

1227
00:54:39.654 --> 00:54:41.281
- For years.
Windham was always like.

1228
00:54:41.322 --> 00:54:42.657
"Hey. we got to do something.

1229
00:54:42.699 --> 00:54:43.950
Let's do something.
Let's do something."

1230
00:54:43.992 --> 00:54:45.660
And I'm like. well.
you have my number.

1231
00:54:45.702 --> 00:54:46.911
Call me.

1232
00:54:46.953 --> 00:54:48.455
And then out of the blue
at. like. 2:00 AM.

1233
00:54:48.496 --> 00:54:50.206
I finally got the call
from Windham.

1234
00:54:50.248 --> 00:54:52.125
in classic Windham fashion.

1235
00:54:52.167 --> 00:54:55.628
And he was like. hey. man.
I've been sent home.

1236
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:57.422
Creative has nothing for me.

1237
00:54:57.464 --> 00:54:58.923
I know what that means.

1238
00:54:58.965 --> 00:55:02.052
I got to do something drastic.
and I need your help.

1239
00:55:02.093 --> 00:55:04.554
* *

1240
00:55:08.099 --> 00:55:11.019
[tense music]

1241
00:55:11.061 --> 00:55:13.688
* *

1242
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:19.944
- In the spring of 2019.

1243
00:55:19.986 --> 00:55:23.239
Windham had an idea
for a new character.

1244
00:55:23.281 --> 00:55:25.992
- I've always been a huge
fan of. like. horror movies.

1245
00:55:26.034 --> 00:55:27.619
So naturally.
the progression was--

1246
00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.788
you know. when I started
watching wrestling.

1247
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:32.290
it was the horror characters
that always caught my eye.

1248
00:55:32.332 --> 00:55:34.584
One of my earliest memories
was Papa Shango

1249
00:55:34.626 --> 00:55:36.586
and The Ultimate Warrior.

1250
00:55:36.628 --> 00:55:37.962
- Well. take a look
at Papa Shango's face.

1251
00:55:38.004 --> 00:55:38.797
He's in a trance.

1252
00:55:38.838 --> 00:55:40.382
He's in another world.

1253
00:55:40.423 --> 00:55:44.135
And the curse is affecting
The Ultimate Warrior.

1254
00:55:44.177 --> 00:55:45.679
- That type of stuff
is the stuff

1255
00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:47.555
that really sticks in my head.
you know?

1256
00:55:47.597 --> 00:55:49.849
I think that wrestling needs

1257
00:55:49.891 --> 00:55:53.561
that kind of dark entity
in it.

1258
00:55:53.603 --> 00:55:55.647
- When we were children.
we weren't hearing

1259
00:55:55.689 --> 00:55:58.274
the stereotypical
bedtime stories.

1260
00:55:58.316 --> 00:56:00.819
We were hearing Stephen King.

1261
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:03.113
- They needed their daily
update of where my book was

1262
00:56:03.154 --> 00:56:04.364
and what it was doing.

1263
00:56:04.406 --> 00:56:06.324
And they would both come
to the table

1264
00:56:06.366 --> 00:56:11.496
with these. like. characters
all with a Stephen King basis.

1265
00:56:11.538 --> 00:56:15.333
They have that influence.

1266
00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:16.835
I didn't mean to do it.
but I did.

1267
00:56:16.876 --> 00:56:18.128
[laughs]

1268
00:56:19.754 --> 00:56:22.382
- We both were huge fans
of horror movies

1269
00:56:22.424 --> 00:56:25.885
and the contrast
between good and evil.

1270
00:56:25.927 --> 00:56:29.889
But not only that. to make
what you would think to be good

1271
00:56:29.931 --> 00:56:33.643
seem evil and what you'd
think to be evil seem good.

1272
00:56:33.685 --> 00:56:37.147
* *

1273
00:56:37.188 --> 00:56:38.231
- So yeah.

1274
00:56:38.273 --> 00:56:40.608
There's a bunch
of our old concept.

1275
00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:42.235
Good thing I'm a hoarder.

1276
00:56:42.277 --> 00:56:43.361
[laughter]

1277
00:56:43.403 --> 00:56:44.571
So yeah. man.

1278
00:56:44.612 --> 00:56:45.905
Again. working
with your brother is

1279
00:56:45.947 --> 00:56:47.741
the funnest time I've ever had

1280
00:56:47.782 --> 00:56:49.743
professionally and personally.

1281
00:56:49.784 --> 00:56:51.494
I remember he just called
and he was like. yeah.

1282
00:56:51.536 --> 00:56:53.079
I want to come up
with this idea.

1283
00:56:53.121 --> 00:56:54.330
I want this mask.

1284
00:56:54.372 --> 00:56:55.582
- We both loved wrestling.

1285
00:56:55.623 --> 00:56:58.251
but I was The Rock
and Stone Cold.

1286
00:56:58.293 --> 00:57:01.338
and he was Kane and Undertaker
and Papa Shango.

1287
00:57:01.379 --> 00:57:02.630
You know. anything weird.

1288
00:57:02.672 --> 00:57:06.343
He was always attracted
to that. I think

1289
00:57:06.384 --> 00:57:09.220
because if you look at him.
he looks like a monster.

1290
00:57:09.262 --> 00:57:11.973
But he had the biggest
and best heart.

1291
00:57:12.015 --> 00:57:13.850
- I'm obviously paraphrasing.
but I remember

1292
00:57:13.892 --> 00:57:16.436
he said one time that
the only way to judge darkness

1293
00:57:16.478 --> 00:57:18.271
is through
the absence of light.

1294
00:57:18.313 --> 00:57:20.899
So you know. just doing that
was like this beautiful thing.

1295
00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:23.860
Then he's like. no. let's show
the world if you use something

1296
00:57:23.902 --> 00:57:26.154
that's dark. you can show
the world how beautiful

1297
00:57:26.196 --> 00:57:27.405
it is by contrast.

1298
00:57:27.447 --> 00:57:29.991
[indistinct chatter]

1299
00:57:34.788 --> 00:57:35.997
- Are we ready. Bray?

1300
00:57:36.039 --> 00:57:37.123
- I'm ready.

1301
00:57:37.165 --> 00:57:38.375
- All right. Let's do it.

1302
00:57:38.416 --> 00:57:43.004
- This new character
needed a new world.

1303
00:57:43.046 --> 00:57:44.798
- And action.

1304
00:57:44.839 --> 00:57:48.635
- This is the Firefly
Fun House.

1305
00:57:48.677 --> 00:57:49.928
[dramatic music]

1306
00:57:49.969 --> 00:57:51.137
- I had the opportunity
to work

1307
00:57:51.179 --> 00:57:54.140
on the first
Firefly Fun Houses.

1308
00:57:54.182 --> 00:57:59.104
The Firefly Fun House only
existed in Bray's mind.

1309
00:57:59.145 --> 00:58:00.689
It was not a real place.

1310
00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:04.109
He would allow us
inside that head.

1311
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.821
And you can accept it
because it was fantasy.

1312
00:58:07.862 --> 00:58:09.948
When you walk in.
you want to just say. really.

1313
00:58:09.989 --> 00:58:10.949
- Really.

1314
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:12.200
- Then you'll go. really.
- Really.

1315
00:58:12.242 --> 00:58:13.493
- And then look back
at the camera.

1316
00:58:13.535 --> 00:58:15.120
[soft music]

1317
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:17.247
- Shooting the Fun House
was unlike anything

1318
00:58:17.288 --> 00:58:18.540
WWE has done before.

1319
00:58:18.581 --> 00:58:19.791
And that was always
our intention

1320
00:58:19.833 --> 00:58:21.001
was to do something
completely different.

1321
00:58:21.042 --> 00:58:22.335
And in wrestling.
that's tough because

1322
00:58:22.377 --> 00:58:23.920
everybody's done everything
at some point.

1323
00:58:23.962 --> 00:58:24.879
- I'm trying
to make it different.

1324
00:58:24.921 --> 00:58:26.089
- Yeah. Follow the leader.

1325
00:58:26.131 --> 00:58:27.924
Follow the leader.
Follow the leader.

1326
00:58:27.966 --> 00:58:30.760
- I was blown away
by how talented he was.

1327
00:58:30.802 --> 00:58:35.098
- See you later! Bye! [laughs]

1328
00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:37.142
Can I see what that
looks like real quick?

1329
00:58:37.183 --> 00:58:41.771
- Windham's brain is just
like a tornado of ideas.

1330
00:58:41.813 --> 00:58:44.315
- Could it be warped somehow?

1331
00:58:44.357 --> 00:58:46.484
- He has so many different
things he wants to do.

1332
00:58:46.526 --> 00:58:47.902
wants to say.

1333
00:58:47.944 --> 00:58:49.946
And it's just so many
different things at once

1334
00:58:49.988 --> 00:58:52.699
that the hard part is
kind of containing it.

1335
00:58:52.741 --> 00:58:54.868
- What about if I deliver
the line before

1336
00:58:54.909 --> 00:58:56.578
while I'm standing
and then the next thing is

1337
00:58:56.619 --> 00:58:58.163
the music's playing
and it's just

1338
00:58:58.204 --> 00:59:00.290
da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
at the end?

1339
00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:04.169
- All you have to do is...
- Let me in.

1340
00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:06.629
- His range of interests
were so wide.

1341
00:59:06.671 --> 00:59:08.298
He knew something
about everything

1342
00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:09.924
and he drew inspiration
from everything.

1343
00:59:09.966 --> 00:59:11.426
- Oh.

1344
00:59:11.468 --> 00:59:13.887
And I want to introduce you
to some very special friends

1345
00:59:13.928 --> 00:59:15.847
that I've met along the way.

1346
00:59:17.223 --> 00:59:19.434
- A key component
of Windham's vision

1347
00:59:19.476 --> 00:59:23.563
included multiple puppets that
would enhance his character.

1348
00:59:23.605 --> 00:59:26.858
This is my friend
Huskus the Pig Boy.

1349
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.361
- Join us. Join us.

1350
00:59:29.402 --> 00:59:32.614
- Huskus was obviously
a representation of Bray

1351
00:59:32.655 --> 00:59:35.909
and the stuff that he'd gone
through with his weight.

1352
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:39.913
The Ramblin' Rabbit was
sort of the personification

1353
00:59:39.954 --> 00:59:41.956
of people's opinion of Bray--
of him rambling

1354
00:59:41.998 --> 00:59:44.000
too much in his promos.

1355
00:59:44.042 --> 00:59:45.627
- Oh. OK.

1356
00:59:45.669 --> 00:59:46.961
Yeah.

1357
00:59:47.003 --> 00:59:49.297
- Mercy was a little bit
of an homage

1358
00:59:49.339 --> 00:59:51.383
to Waylon Mercy.
the character that

1359
00:59:51.424 --> 00:59:54.094
Bray drew so much
influence from.

1360
00:59:54.135 --> 00:59:56.554
Abby was Sister Abigail.
an imaginary sister

1361
00:59:56.596 --> 00:59:59.099
of Bray Wyatt in his story.

1362
00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.267
- After several weeks
of preparation.

1363
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:04.854
the Firefly Fun House
premiered in prime time

1364
01:00:04.896 --> 01:00:07.482
on Monday Night Raw.

1365
01:00:07.524 --> 01:00:10.819
[cheers and applause]

1366
01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.987
- Did you miss me?

1367
01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:17.033
Oh. how I
have missed you.

1368
01:00:17.075 --> 01:00:18.910
- When I first saw
the Firefly Fun House.

1369
01:00:18.952 --> 01:00:21.913
I remember texting one
of the writers saying.

1370
01:00:21.955 --> 01:00:23.206
this is brilliant.

1371
01:00:23.248 --> 01:00:25.417
- Hi.

1372
01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:27.669
Did you enjoy my little secret?

1373
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:29.963
- Really enjoyed
the Pee-wee's Playhouse

1374
01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:33.174
take of the Firefly Fun House.

1375
01:00:33.216 --> 01:00:36.261
- Sociopath is
the word of the day.

1376
01:00:36.302 --> 01:00:38.763
Sociopath.

1377
01:00:38.805 --> 01:00:40.807
- He thought of
all that stuff himself.

1378
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:44.394
Puts himself
in the genius category.

1379
01:00:44.436 --> 01:00:46.104
- Let me in.

1380
01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:49.733
- It was like Mister Rogers
meets Tales from the Crypt.

1381
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:55.071
- Whenever there was
a Firefly Fun House going on.

1382
01:00:55.113 --> 01:00:58.033
on a screen in the back
as the show is going.

1383
01:00:58.074 --> 01:01:01.161
there would always be a sellout
at one of those monitors

1384
01:01:01.202 --> 01:01:04.372
to see what Bray was going to
do in that Fun House that week.

1385
01:01:04.414 --> 01:01:08.251
- Today. I have something super
serious to talk to you about.

1386
01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:17.218
Exercise!

1387
01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.846
- For him to be able to pivot
and all of a sudden go.

1388
01:01:19.888 --> 01:01:20.972
hi. welcome to the Fun House.

1389
01:01:21.014 --> 01:01:22.349
We're going to work out.

1390
01:01:22.390 --> 01:01:26.311
He had the charisma that
so many guys don't have.

1391
01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:29.189
- I really appreciated
the Firefly Fun House

1392
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:31.608
because it was the public eye's
first opportunity

1393
01:01:31.649 --> 01:01:33.234
to see Windham be silly.

1394
01:01:33.276 --> 01:01:34.444
- Yowie-wowie!

1395
01:01:34.486 --> 01:01:36.571
You found me.

1396
01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:39.616
- Knowing Windham. you knew
it was going to go dark.

1397
01:01:39.657 --> 01:01:41.701
- I will always light the way.

1398
01:01:41.743 --> 01:01:46.539
And all you have to do
is let me in.

1399
01:01:46.581 --> 01:01:48.750
- And it was going to be scary.

1400
01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:51.544
- After months of hosting
the bizarre program.

1401
01:01:51.586 --> 01:01:55.465
in the summer of 2019.
Windham would introduce

1402
01:01:55.507 --> 01:01:58.468
the WWE Universe
to his darker side.

1403
01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:00.303
- As tight as it can go.

1404
01:02:00.345 --> 01:02:01.638
That's perfect.

1405
01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:03.848
Let's go make some nightmares.

1406
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.266
- The Fiend.

1407
01:02:05.308 --> 01:02:07.268
[dramatic music]

1408
01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:09.896
- Yowie-wowie!

1409
01:02:09.938 --> 01:02:13.983
- It was a brand-new character
that lived in Bray's head.

1410
01:02:14.025 --> 01:02:17.737
However. it could take over
Bray's body.

1411
01:02:17.779 --> 01:02:20.240
And then The Fiend became real.

1412
01:02:20.281 --> 01:02:22.951
- The dichotomy of this
sadistic character

1413
01:02:22.992 --> 01:02:26.037
in the children's setup.
it was so bizarre.

1414
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.580
and it felt wrong.

1415
01:02:27.622 --> 01:02:29.416
But it was one of those things
you couldn't look away from.

1416
01:02:30.583 --> 01:02:33.128
- Coming up next
here at SummerSlam.

1417
01:02:33.169 --> 01:02:35.880
it is the in-ring debut
of The Fiend.

1418
01:02:35.922 --> 01:02:38.133
It's Finn Bálor
versus Bray Wyatt.

1419
01:02:38.174 --> 01:02:41.136
who went through this
bizarre transformation

1420
01:02:41.177 --> 01:02:45.807
in a place called
the Firefly Fun House.

1421
01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:47.976
- He showed up on the day
of SummerSlam.

1422
01:02:48.018 --> 01:02:50.603
and I seen what
the character was.

1423
01:02:50.645 --> 01:02:51.855
I just said. oh. wow.

1424
01:02:51.896 --> 01:02:53.440
This is cool.

1425
01:02:53.481 --> 01:02:55.316
- We're seeing so many
different forms

1426
01:02:55.358 --> 01:02:57.944
of intimidation
from The Fiend.

1427
01:02:57.986 --> 01:03:00.697
- This is just disturbing.

1428
01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:02.615
- The thing about
professional wrestling

1429
01:03:02.657 --> 01:03:04.868
is it's one of the only
forms of entertainment

1430
01:03:04.909 --> 01:03:08.455
where you have to do it
live in front of an audience

1431
01:03:08.496 --> 01:03:11.374
with no CGI.
no camera effects.

1432
01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:14.210
So when The Fiend shows up
in the arena

1433
01:03:14.252 --> 01:03:17.797
and he's literally
a horror movie monster.

1434
01:03:17.839 --> 01:03:20.592
I was like.
this is unbelievable.

1435
01:03:20.633 --> 01:03:21.551
- I love it.

1436
01:03:22.552 --> 01:03:23.511
- That's cool.

1437
01:03:24.888 --> 01:03:25.930
- Awesome.

1438
01:03:25.972 --> 01:03:26.973
Happy for you. brother.

1439
01:03:27.015 --> 01:03:28.641
[tense music]

1440
01:03:28.683 --> 01:03:32.771
- The Fiend is
my favorite character

1441
01:03:32.812 --> 01:03:34.522
in WWE. of all time.

1442
01:03:34.564 --> 01:03:39.778
Someone had finally pulled off
a split-personality character.

1443
01:03:39.819 --> 01:03:41.363
- I was like. you genius.

1444
01:03:41.404 --> 01:03:43.740
You just printed $10 million
worth of merchandise overnight.

1445
01:03:43.782 --> 01:03:45.200
[laughs]

1446
01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:49.329
- I'm really excited to see
The Fiend. Bray Wyatt.

1447
01:03:49.371 --> 01:03:51.831
- Seeing all these kids
wearing the mask.

1448
01:03:51.873 --> 01:03:55.251
just the way it captivated
the audience. it was awesome.

1449
01:03:56.461 --> 01:03:58.838
- Within months.
The Fiend's popularity

1450
01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.842
skyrocketed and had him on
a collision course

1451
01:04:02.884 --> 01:04:06.846
with an old foe. John Cena.

1452
01:04:06.888 --> 01:04:09.265
[cheers and applause]

1453
01:04:10.725 --> 01:04:13.061
- WrestleMania was
scheduled to take place

1454
01:04:13.103 --> 01:04:15.647
at Raymond James Stadium
in Tampa

1455
01:04:15.689 --> 01:04:17.232
where the Buccaneers play.

1456
01:04:17.273 --> 01:04:21.111
Due to COVID. we were not
able to have the audience

1457
01:04:21.152 --> 01:04:23.530
and be able to have the show
that we wanted to have

1458
01:04:23.571 --> 01:04:24.823
in front of an audience.

1459
01:04:24.864 --> 01:04:27.742
So we had to take it
to the Performance Center.

1460
01:04:27.784 --> 01:04:30.370
where we had been doing TV.

1461
01:04:30.412 --> 01:04:34.290
And The Fiend
did not lend itself

1462
01:04:34.332 --> 01:04:37.043
to be in an empty arena.

1463
01:04:37.085 --> 01:04:41.673
And we were looking for matches
that were unique.

1464
01:04:41.715 --> 01:04:43.591
We just got to thinking
one day and said.

1465
01:04:43.633 --> 01:04:46.594
why don't we have
a Firefly Fun House match?

1466
01:04:46.636 --> 01:04:50.223
- The story of the Firefly
Fun House goes like this.

1467
01:04:50.265 --> 01:04:52.183
We are sitting
in a conference table

1468
01:04:52.225 --> 01:04:53.518
at the NXT Performance Center.

1469
01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.978
Someone opens the door
and says.

1470
01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:57.063
"You have
a Firefly Fun House match

1471
01:04:57.105 --> 01:04:59.190
at WrestleMania
with Bray Wyatt."

1472
01:04:59.232 --> 01:05:01.151
And I said. well. what's
a Firefly Fun House match?

1473
01:05:01.192 --> 01:05:02.152
They said.
"Well. we don't know."

1474
01:05:02.193 --> 01:05:03.695
I said. [bleep] great.

1475
01:05:06.239 --> 01:05:09.534
This is going to be somethin'.

1476
01:05:11.077 --> 01:05:13.038
I was like. OK.
what story can we tell?

1477
01:05:13.079 --> 01:05:14.456
- There's a world that exists

1478
01:05:14.497 --> 01:05:16.583
beyond the realm
of our comprehension.

1479
01:05:16.624 --> 01:05:19.919
- Like. yo. we can make this
a meta journey.

1480
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:21.254
So--and the lighting
stays the same.

1481
01:05:21.296 --> 01:05:22.505
And yeah.
- Boom. Boom.

1482
01:05:22.547 --> 01:05:24.966
So basically. this is in
two of the scenes.

1483
01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:26.968
That's in another scene.
That's a scene.

1484
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.595
And then there's a scene
over there.

1485
01:05:28.636 --> 01:05:31.681
- If all I got is rapping.
I'll use it to my advantage.

1486
01:05:31.723 --> 01:05:33.516
'cause I'm like Husky Harris.

1487
01:05:33.558 --> 01:05:35.435
It's a weight
that I can manage.

1488
01:05:35.477 --> 01:05:37.937
Windham immediately channeled
right in. and he got it.

1489
01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:40.106
And he was like. and then we
do this. and then we do this.

1490
01:05:40.148 --> 01:05:42.984
- It's time to rewrite
my own story.

1491
01:05:43.026 --> 01:05:44.736
- No idea was off-limits.

1492
01:05:44.778 --> 01:05:46.196
We start working out.

1493
01:05:46.237 --> 01:05:47.530
And I just start working out.

1494
01:05:47.572 --> 01:05:49.115
and we have to stay there
absurdly long.

1495
01:05:49.157 --> 01:05:50.700
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

1496
01:05:50.742 --> 01:05:52.118
Let me tell you something.

1497
01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.704
Any idea
that I relayed to him.

1498
01:05:54.746 --> 01:05:56.498
he could make it better.

1499
01:05:56.539 --> 01:05:59.000
And any idea that he brought
to me. I was willing to do.

1500
01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:00.585
- I need a printout of that.

1501
01:06:00.627 --> 01:06:04.005
And I think yeah. everybody
should have it just

1502
01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:05.590
so you know
where I'm coming from.

1503
01:06:05.632 --> 01:06:09.803
Give it up for John Cena!

1504
01:06:09.844 --> 01:06:11.805
- Watching it back.
you'd think we'd had

1505
01:06:11.846 --> 01:06:13.223
six months to prepare for it.

1506
01:06:13.264 --> 01:06:15.350
But in reality.
it was. like. two days.

1507
01:06:15.392 --> 01:06:17.727
Somehow. it got pulled off.

1508
01:06:17.769 --> 01:06:19.854
- This is going to be spooky.

1509
01:06:19.896 --> 01:06:24.067
- You got to see all of these
different characters

1510
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:26.986
come to life.

1511
01:06:27.028 --> 01:06:30.532
- It's like a mini-movie.

1512
01:06:30.573 --> 01:06:32.075
- It used to just be
challenging enough

1513
01:06:32.117 --> 01:06:33.785
to do something good.

1514
01:06:33.827 --> 01:06:34.994
That's hard.

1515
01:06:35.036 --> 01:06:36.329
But now in the age of content.

1516
01:06:36.371 --> 01:06:38.832
what's harder is
to do something memorable.

1517
01:06:38.873 --> 01:06:40.417
So full credit.

1518
01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:42.335
Because we're still talking
about it. and we still

1519
01:06:42.377 --> 01:06:45.130
will be talking about it
for years to come.

1520
01:06:48.633 --> 01:06:51.428
- Following the success
of that match.

1521
01:06:51.469 --> 01:06:55.598
fans were introduced
to a new Fun House character.

1522
01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.184
- He had all these ideas
for me and different ways

1523
01:06:58.226 --> 01:07:00.020
that the character could go.

1524
01:07:00.061 --> 01:07:04.190
Let him in.

1525
01:07:04.232 --> 01:07:07.235
He always had
these off-the-wall ideas

1526
01:07:07.277 --> 01:07:08.611
that once he explained them.

1527
01:07:08.653 --> 01:07:11.448
you're like.
that's freaking genius.

1528
01:07:11.489 --> 01:07:13.408
Do you like my playground?

1529
01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:16.119
[laughs]

1530
01:07:16.161 --> 01:07:18.705
He built this for me.

1531
01:07:18.747 --> 01:07:22.334
He taught me to open my mind
more creatively

1532
01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:24.461
and to step my game up.

1533
01:07:24.502 --> 01:07:27.547
And I had a lot of fun.

1534
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:29.132
It's fun.

1535
01:07:29.174 --> 01:07:31.134
[laughter]

1536
01:07:31.176 --> 01:07:32.844
That was the best--

1537
01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:35.055
still is the best--
moments of my career.

1538
01:07:35.096 --> 01:07:36.890
- I think we can do
better than that.

1539
01:07:36.931 --> 01:07:38.558
By you--by we. I mean me.

1540
01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:40.643
[laughter]

1541
01:07:41.936 --> 01:07:44.064
- Windham's happiness
behind the scenes

1542
01:07:44.105 --> 01:07:45.982
translated on screen.

1543
01:07:46.024 --> 01:07:50.070
But he was about to experience
a heavy loss.

1544
01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:52.655
* *

1545
01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:57.077
[somber music]

1546
01:07:57.118 --> 01:07:59.537
- In December of 2020.

1547
01:07:59.579 --> 01:08:01.748
one of Windham's
closest friends.

1548
01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:07.337
John Huber.
tragically passed away.

1549
01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:09.214
He was 41 years old.

1550
01:08:09.255 --> 01:08:12.467
* *

1551
01:08:12.509 --> 01:08:15.595
- [crying] I didn't want
to believe it was true.

1552
01:08:15.637 --> 01:08:20.767
I don't think my brain let me
do it--let me believe it.

1553
01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:25.230
* *

1554
01:08:25.271 --> 01:08:27.357
I'm struggling.

1555
01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:33.446
* *

1556
01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:38.284
- I know he was hurting a lot.

1557
01:08:38.326 --> 01:08:41.788
Because I know
I was hurting a lot.

1558
01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:44.040
- They were so close.
They were like brothers.

1559
01:08:44.082 --> 01:08:46.835
When you're in a group
together with someone.

1560
01:08:46.876 --> 01:08:49.462
you share so much
of your lives together

1561
01:08:49.504 --> 01:08:52.465
and they talk about their
families and their kids

1562
01:08:52.507 --> 01:08:54.384
and all those things.

1563
01:08:54.426 --> 01:08:57.554
So I know it was
a profound loss for him.

1564
01:08:57.595 --> 01:08:59.973
- I know more than anybody
that no one can fill

1565
01:09:00.015 --> 01:09:03.977
the void that he left behind.

1566
01:09:04.019 --> 01:09:09.232
But I swear to God. I'll try.

1567
01:09:09.274 --> 01:09:11.943
* *

1568
01:09:11.985 --> 01:09:16.573
- He always just carried
the heaviness around.

1569
01:09:16.614 --> 01:09:19.826
And he had a really.
really. really hard time.

1570
01:09:19.868 --> 01:09:22.162
[tense music]

1571
01:09:22.203 --> 01:09:24.414
- Windham struggled

1572
01:09:24.456 --> 01:09:28.501
emotionally
and professionally.

1573
01:09:28.543 --> 01:09:33.214
- Bray was a creative genius
for his characters.

1574
01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:36.468
To work with Bray was
very challenging because--

1575
01:09:36.509 --> 01:09:39.429
I don't think that
Bray came from a bad place.

1576
01:09:39.471 --> 01:09:41.348
but Bray had his visions.

1577
01:09:41.389 --> 01:09:46.144
Bray had what he wanted to do
and Bray would fight you on it.

1578
01:09:46.186 --> 01:09:47.187
- You can't put
the sweatband on?

1579
01:09:47.228 --> 01:09:48.271
- No.

1580
01:09:48.313 --> 01:09:49.606
- What's the transition?

1581
01:09:49.647 --> 01:09:51.107
How do I get to the rabbit?

1582
01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:53.026
- I'm grabbing him now anyway.

1583
01:09:53.068 --> 01:09:54.819
- He didn't like when other
people were getting involved

1584
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:56.529
and telling him what to do
and telling him

1585
01:09:56.571 --> 01:09:58.365
how the character should act
and how he should speak.

1586
01:09:58.406 --> 01:10:01.326
So it took a toll on him.

1587
01:10:01.368 --> 01:10:03.328
- Bray was
a tremendous success.

1588
01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:04.704
But I think he created
something that was

1589
01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:08.041
larger than another
individual's thought process.

1590
01:10:08.083 --> 01:10:10.627
* *

1591
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:14.255
- While there's a clear line
between Windham and Bray Wyatt

1592
01:10:14.297 --> 01:10:16.549
and The Fiend
and all those things.

1593
01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:19.636
they're all pieces of him
that he put out there.

1594
01:10:19.678 --> 01:10:22.430
Sort of his heart and soul
out on his sleeve.

1595
01:10:22.472 --> 01:10:24.891
He never stopped
thinking about it.

1596
01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:28.061
- There's something
we're missing here.

1597
01:10:28.103 --> 01:10:30.355
- It's one of the geniuses
of him creatively.

1598
01:10:30.397 --> 01:10:32.065
It's also one of
the things that was

1599
01:10:32.107 --> 01:10:33.983
difficult to work with him on
because he was like

1600
01:10:34.025 --> 01:10:36.569
this whirlwind of ideas
at all times.

1601
01:10:36.611 --> 01:10:39.989
Harnessing him into one thing
got harder and harder--

1602
01:10:40.031 --> 01:10:42.367
keeping him focused
on the one idea

1603
01:10:42.409 --> 01:10:45.912
at hand. getting him
to agree to the idea

1604
01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:48.581
that everybody was working on.
and then stay committed to it

1605
01:10:48.623 --> 01:10:50.542
and not. all of a sudden.
show up one day and go.

1606
01:10:50.583 --> 01:10:52.043
"Guys. I think we're going in
the wrong direction.

1607
01:10:52.085 --> 01:10:53.670
We need to start over here."

1608
01:10:58.508 --> 01:11:01.428
- As the tension grew.
the Bray Wyatt character

1609
01:11:01.469 --> 01:11:05.098
was about to undergo
a drastic change.

1610
01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:08.309
- We had an Inferno match.

1611
01:11:08.351 --> 01:11:11.271
I remember seeing
the look on his face

1612
01:11:11.312 --> 01:11:13.898
as he's getting covered
with just all this goop

1613
01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.067
to keep him safe.

1614
01:11:16.109 --> 01:11:18.903
That was a stressful day.

1615
01:11:24.325 --> 01:11:25.660
- So frustrated?

1616
01:11:25.702 --> 01:11:27.787
Yes. to put it lightly.

1617
01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:30.623
- The only way to win is

1618
01:11:30.665 --> 01:11:33.960
to light any part of your
opponent on fire.

1619
01:11:34.002 --> 01:11:36.046
[dramatic music]

1620
01:11:36.087 --> 01:11:37.005
- Oh! The Fiend's on fire!

1621
01:11:37.047 --> 01:11:38.423
- Oh. my God! Orton!

1622
01:11:38.465 --> 01:11:41.009
Orton just lit
The Fiend on fire!

1623
01:11:41.051 --> 01:11:43.345
- He got burned.

1624
01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:47.974
That was extremely
frustrating to him.

1625
01:11:48.016 --> 01:11:49.684
- He was very particular
with his story

1626
01:11:49.726 --> 01:11:51.686
from beginning to end.

1627
01:11:51.728 --> 01:11:55.398
You can't pay off something
if it took a turn.

1628
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.983
He didn't know how to do that.

1629
01:11:57.025 --> 01:11:59.736
And I think that was
very frustrating for him.

1630
01:12:07.327 --> 01:12:09.746
- That was the problem
with the burnt Bray.

1631
01:12:09.788 --> 01:12:14.709
Because you had to have
everything on you burnt

1632
01:12:14.751 --> 01:12:18.338
and melted and smoldering.

1633
01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.090
No one thought about that.

1634
01:12:20.131 --> 01:12:23.718
- Let me bring this to you back
when I got this shit off of me.

1635
01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.261
But we ain't going
to take pictures.

1636
01:12:25.303 --> 01:12:26.888
This is really brutal.

1637
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:29.432
- All of a sudden now you're
going from wrestling gear

1638
01:12:29.474 --> 01:12:34.437
and a hot mask
to a hot mask and hot gear.

1639
01:12:34.479 --> 01:12:37.023
- I don't know
if I can work like this.

1640
01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:38.525
- It was very difficult
to move in.

1641
01:12:38.566 --> 01:12:39.859
It wasn't as pliable.

1642
01:12:39.901 --> 01:12:43.363
It wasn't as easy to maneuver
and do everything

1643
01:12:43.405 --> 01:12:45.407
that you wanted to do.

1644
01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:47.701
- It moves and turns
when you grab it.

1645
01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:54.374
[soft music]

1646
01:12:54.416 --> 01:12:56.251
- Remember this one.

1647
01:12:56.292 --> 01:12:58.211
- Wild looking at this.

1648
01:12:58.253 --> 01:12:59.713
'cause we both know

1649
01:12:59.754 --> 01:13:02.340
what a hard time
he was having at this point.

1650
01:13:02.382 --> 01:13:03.717
You know. like...

1651
01:13:03.758 --> 01:13:05.969
- You're putting it politely.

1652
01:13:06.011 --> 01:13:08.346
He hated this thing.

1653
01:13:08.388 --> 01:13:10.056
Your brother knew
the responsibility.

1654
01:13:10.098 --> 01:13:12.100
I think it weighed a lot
on him. and it was hard.

1655
01:13:12.142 --> 01:13:14.686
And I felt really bad for him
because I know

1656
01:13:14.728 --> 01:13:17.731
he gave it his all.
he tried 100% to try to carry

1657
01:13:17.772 --> 01:13:20.316
you know. not only his
character and the brand

1658
01:13:20.358 --> 01:13:22.652
and the company and everything.
but it just--

1659
01:13:22.694 --> 01:13:24.112
- It all led
to that WrestleMania.

1660
01:13:24.154 --> 01:13:25.572
- Yeah.

1661
01:13:28.158 --> 01:13:31.119
[dramatic music]

1662
01:13:31.161 --> 01:13:33.830
* *

1663
01:13:33.872 --> 01:13:38.918
- WrestleMania 37.
the first time in over a year

1664
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.880
that the WWE fans
would be in attendance.

1665
01:13:41.921 --> 01:13:44.591
- Who are you excited to see?

1666
01:13:44.632 --> 01:13:47.969
- Mostly The Fiend.

1667
01:13:48.011 --> 01:13:50.472
- I'm really excited
to see Bray Wyatt.

1668
01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:52.098
I like his mind games
that he plays.

1669
01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:55.185
- I want to see The Fiend
go on and burn Randy Orton

1670
01:13:55.226 --> 01:13:56.644
down to the ground.

1671
01:13:56.686 --> 01:13:58.938
* *

1672
01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:01.107
- Yeah. at WrestleMania.
when we finally were

1673
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:03.943
in front of people.
you see the transformation--

1674
01:14:03.985 --> 01:14:08.573
The Fiend is stepping out
of hell and of that burnt.

1675
01:14:08.615 --> 01:14:12.160
And now you have The Fiend
again. and a pissed-off Fiend.

1676
01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:14.662
It was a way to get back
to The Fiend.

1677
01:14:14.704 --> 01:14:18.416
Because the burn--the whole
outfit didn't work.

1678
01:14:18.458 --> 01:14:21.795
and it was tough
to continue that.

1679
01:14:21.836 --> 01:14:24.547
- And The Fiend
has been restored.

1680
01:14:24.589 --> 01:14:27.300
- I think everyone was
just as excited as we were

1681
01:14:27.342 --> 01:14:28.843
to see the Fiend back.

1682
01:14:28.885 --> 01:14:34.474
and it immediately turned into
I turned on him...

1683
01:14:34.516 --> 01:14:35.809
- What the...

1684
01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:37.686
- Causing him
to lose the match.

1685
01:14:37.727 --> 01:14:40.939
- And now Orton
from behind with an RKO!

1686
01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:45.235
- And it wasn't what
people wanted to see.

1687
01:14:45.276 --> 01:14:47.195
- If you love something that
much and you put that much

1688
01:14:47.237 --> 01:14:52.200
time and effort. you want it
to go the way your vision is.

1689
01:14:52.242 --> 01:14:54.869
And that was. like.
very frustrating for him.

1690
01:14:57.372 --> 01:15:02.002
- At the time. I don't know
exactly what the downfall was.

1691
01:15:02.043 --> 01:15:06.089
Creative minds can often be
misinterpreted very easily.

1692
01:15:06.131 --> 01:15:09.759
So you can begin
to have disagreements

1693
01:15:09.801 --> 01:15:11.886
of how things go.
but it can be interpreted

1694
01:15:11.928 --> 01:15:14.764
in many different ways--
as creative differences

1695
01:15:14.806 --> 01:15:17.350
or he's just difficult
to work with.

1696
01:15:17.392 --> 01:15:18.935
I don't know the exact answer.

1697
01:15:18.977 --> 01:15:21.688
I just know that
it fell apart somehow.

1698
01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:23.273
* *

1699
01:15:23.314 --> 01:15:25.859
- At that time.
WWE was still dealing with

1700
01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:27.360
the fallout of the pandemic.

1701
01:15:27.402 --> 01:15:30.113
And they released
a bunch of superstars.

1702
01:15:30.155 --> 01:15:32.699
one of them being
Windham's brother. Taylor.

1703
01:15:32.741 --> 01:15:34.284
And then a few months later.

1704
01:15:34.325 --> 01:15:38.288
they ended up releasing
Windham as well.

1705
01:15:38.329 --> 01:15:41.291
You just kept clicking. trying
to find the thing that goes.

1706
01:15:41.332 --> 01:15:42.500
no. that was fake.

1707
01:15:42.542 --> 01:15:43.585
That's not true.

1708
01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:44.753
No. of course it's not true.

1709
01:15:44.794 --> 01:15:47.213
- We all were shocked.

1710
01:15:47.255 --> 01:15:51.051
In retrospect. I can look back
and I can look at pictures

1711
01:15:51.092 --> 01:15:54.387
and I'll zoom in on his eyes
and I see it destroyed him.

1712
01:15:54.429 --> 01:15:57.724
That was bad.

1713
01:15:58.767 --> 01:16:02.896
- Aside from being invested in
his family and his children.

1714
01:16:02.937 --> 01:16:05.899
wrestling was his life
and that was his art

1715
01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:07.817
and that was his outlet.

1716
01:16:07.859 --> 01:16:11.196
And all of a sudden.
instantaneously was--

1717
01:16:11.237 --> 01:16:14.449
that's supposed
to be just gone?

1718
01:16:14.491 --> 01:16:17.077
- For the first time
in over a decade.

1719
01:16:17.118 --> 01:16:20.163
Windham was not part of WWE.

1720
01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:29.381
In its place.
he found a new passion.

1721
01:16:29.422 --> 01:16:31.091
- So we're here in our home.

1722
01:16:31.132 --> 01:16:35.428
And this room. in particular.
was Windham's art room.

1723
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:39.724
It was his space where
he created a lot of his magic.

1724
01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:43.770
And it has been untouched
since he's been here.

1725
01:16:43.812 --> 01:16:45.438
So this is it.

1726
01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.274
This is the mind of Windham.

1727
01:16:48.316 --> 01:16:52.278
The first piece he did.
and it's of me.

1728
01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.571
[laughs]

1729
01:16:53.613 --> 01:16:54.948
So it's one of the first pieces

1730
01:16:54.989 --> 01:16:56.449
he actually completed.

1731
01:16:56.491 --> 01:16:58.451
And it's spray paint.

1732
01:16:58.493 --> 01:16:59.619
[soft music]

1733
01:16:59.661 --> 01:17:00.829
This one right here.

1734
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:02.872
it's Kendyl and Cadyn.

1735
01:17:02.914 --> 01:17:04.416
He wanted to recreate
the picture that he had

1736
01:17:04.457 --> 01:17:06.292
in his phone of his girls.

1737
01:17:06.334 --> 01:17:08.211
And it's a beautiful picture
of them standing

1738
01:17:08.253 --> 01:17:09.838
like that in the street.

1739
01:17:09.879 --> 01:17:15.135
He was in the middle of doing
this as a gift for them.

1740
01:17:15.176 --> 01:17:18.763
I don't know if he ever
truly felt like

1741
01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:20.473
anything was quite finished.

1742
01:17:20.515 --> 01:17:21.808
[laughs]

1743
01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:23.685
He did this over a course
of two years.

1744
01:17:23.727 --> 01:17:24.978
He kept working on this--

1745
01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.730
stopping. starting over.

1746
01:17:26.771 --> 01:17:28.189
But he always kept that part.

1747
01:17:28.231 --> 01:17:29.983
which I thought was
really cool.

1748
01:17:30.025 --> 01:17:32.527
And he kept it because
I told him how much I loved it.

1749
01:17:32.569 --> 01:17:34.821
I was like. oh. I love
those eyes. the face.

1750
01:17:34.863 --> 01:17:36.406
I said.
you did so good with that.

1751
01:17:36.448 --> 01:17:37.866
And he always kept it.

1752
01:17:37.907 --> 01:17:40.326
which I thought was
really cool.

1753
01:17:40.368 --> 01:17:43.163
This one hung in our home
in St. Pete.

1754
01:17:43.204 --> 01:17:47.709
And it reminds me a lot
of when we got engaged.

1755
01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:53.006
He surprised me by getting down
on one knee in St. Pete Pier.

1756
01:17:53.048 --> 01:17:55.633
So this art really ties in.

1757
01:17:55.675 --> 01:17:59.346
They're pieces that I won't
let go of ever in my life

1758
01:17:59.387 --> 01:18:01.890
because it reminds me
of that time.

1759
01:18:01.931 --> 01:18:03.683
* *

1760
01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:08.271
- 100% art is where he really
just threw himself into that.

1761
01:18:08.313 --> 01:18:09.564
and he loved it.

1762
01:18:09.606 --> 01:18:11.441
Just always. oh. come do
this with me and let me

1763
01:18:11.483 --> 01:18:14.986
show you this latest thing
I'm trying out.

1764
01:18:15.028 --> 01:18:16.863
- Next thing you know.
he would be showing us

1765
01:18:16.905 --> 01:18:18.281
these paintings.

1766
01:18:18.323 --> 01:18:19.949
Then we're like. you did that?

1767
01:18:19.991 --> 01:18:21.618
I cannot believe you did that.

1768
01:18:21.659 --> 01:18:23.620
He's like. I've been working on
this for three nights in a row.

1769
01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:26.539
[laughs] Go to sleep.

1770
01:18:26.581 --> 01:18:28.958
It was amazing
to see. once again.

1771
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.251
this anomaly of a human.

1772
01:18:30.293 --> 01:18:31.544
When he invested
into something

1773
01:18:31.586 --> 01:18:32.712
that he was going to do.

1774
01:18:32.754 --> 01:18:34.756
it was going to be phenomenal.

1775
01:18:36.132 --> 01:18:39.094
[light twangy music]

1776
01:18:39.135 --> 01:18:42.097
- While he immersed himself
in his art.

1777
01:18:42.138 --> 01:18:45.016
Windham also started filming
a reality TV pilot

1778
01:18:45.058 --> 01:18:46.434
with his brother.

1779
01:18:46.476 --> 01:18:50.230
* *

1780
01:18:50.271 --> 01:18:52.357
- [laughs]

1781
01:18:52.399 --> 01:18:55.652
Can I touch it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1782
01:18:55.694 --> 01:18:58.613
- We got the opportunity
to go shoot a pilot

1783
01:18:58.655 --> 01:19:00.532
hunting monsters and cryptids

1784
01:19:00.573 --> 01:19:03.326
and conspiracy theories
and going after cults.

1785
01:19:03.368 --> 01:19:05.954
- I can't believe
we're in here. man.

1786
01:19:05.995 --> 01:19:07.288
- Our whole lives.
we've always been into

1787
01:19:07.330 --> 01:19:09.165
the odd things in the world.

1788
01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:10.959
- When I was a little kid.
when you watched. like.

1789
01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:12.377
"The Goonies"
and all that stuff.

1790
01:19:12.419 --> 01:19:14.754
I remember thinking.
oh. man. that's so cool.

1791
01:19:14.796 --> 01:19:16.798
I would love to just go around
with my friends one day

1792
01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.091
and do that.

1793
01:19:18.133 --> 01:19:22.345
So this is how
horror movies end.

1794
01:19:22.387 --> 01:19:25.849
- The more we hung out
and started working on that.

1795
01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:27.100
the more it kind of morphed

1796
01:19:27.142 --> 01:19:29.686
back into talking
about wrestling.

1797
01:19:29.728 --> 01:19:32.272
- I dive in and I think
about it to the point

1798
01:19:32.313 --> 01:19:34.149
where it almost makes me nuts.

1799
01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:37.110
- We got excited again
and realized maybe

1800
01:19:37.152 --> 01:19:38.445
we don't want to do this.

1801
01:19:38.486 --> 01:19:40.613
Maybe we want to go
back and wrestle.

1802
01:19:40.655 --> 01:19:42.949
The more we talked.
the more we collaborated.

1803
01:19:42.991 --> 01:19:45.869
the more we needed
to make it back.

1804
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:50.331
- In the summer of 2022.
after a year away from WWE.

1805
01:19:50.373 --> 01:19:54.544
Windham started talking about
making a return to the ring.

1806
01:19:54.586 --> 01:20:01.051
- There is not a lock
on the door to the WWE.

1807
01:20:01.092 --> 01:20:06.431
And I think the audience was
craving some Bray Wyatt.

1808
01:20:06.473 --> 01:20:10.310
- From the first time I got on
the phone with him to discuss.

1809
01:20:10.352 --> 01:20:12.437
do you want to come back--

1810
01:20:12.479 --> 01:20:15.023
like. hey. I'd love
for you to come home.

1811
01:20:15.065 --> 01:20:17.317
And his part.
hey. I'd love to be home.

1812
01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:20.070
I think that very first
conversation we had.

1813
01:20:20.111 --> 01:20:23.198
it went from. hey.
what are you thinking

1814
01:20:23.239 --> 01:20:25.367
about potentially coming back

1815
01:20:25.408 --> 01:20:28.995
to us riffing ideas
for an hour and a half.

1816
01:20:29.037 --> 01:20:30.288
- He wasn't done.

1817
01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:32.207
He wanted to fix things
about his legacy

1818
01:20:32.248 --> 01:20:34.209
and he didn't want
to go out unexpectedly.

1819
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:38.672
He had a lot more stories
to tell the WWE Universe.

1820
01:20:38.713 --> 01:20:40.131
- He was in the gym a lot.

1821
01:20:40.173 --> 01:20:42.133
Like. three. four hours a day.

1822
01:20:42.175 --> 01:20:44.886
He really busted his ass.

1823
01:20:44.928 --> 01:20:50.350
- In the fall of 2022.
Windham. now 35 years old.

1824
01:20:50.392 --> 01:20:53.645
was preparing for his return.

1825
01:20:53.687 --> 01:20:55.522
- He was coming back.

1826
01:20:55.563 --> 01:20:56.731
He was working for it.

1827
01:20:56.773 --> 01:20:59.150
[tense music]

1828
01:20:59.192 --> 01:21:01.695
- So when Windham was
negotiating with WWE

1829
01:21:01.736 --> 01:21:03.363
to make his return.

1830
01:21:03.405 --> 01:21:07.617
he reached out to TJ
and asked TJ.

1831
01:21:07.659 --> 01:21:09.494
hey. I need you
to keep this to yourself.

1832
01:21:09.536 --> 01:21:12.038
but would you and Natty
be OK if I started

1833
01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.374
coming down to your ring?

1834
01:21:14.416 --> 01:21:16.543
- Bray was super motivated
at that time.

1835
01:21:16.584 --> 01:21:19.170
I did want to gauge
where he was mentally.

1836
01:21:19.212 --> 01:21:20.338
And he said. TJ. I know.

1837
01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:22.507
He said. I'm super excited.

1838
01:21:22.549 --> 01:21:26.094
And he went from it being
kind of a private thing to him

1839
01:21:26.136 --> 01:21:28.263
going around and giving
each person specific.

1840
01:21:28.304 --> 01:21:30.098
individualized advice.

1841
01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:32.100
That just shows you
how his brain was working

1842
01:21:32.142 --> 01:21:34.310
from a creative standpoint.

1843
01:21:34.352 --> 01:21:35.603
- You could just feel
that excitement.

1844
01:21:35.645 --> 01:21:37.605
You felt. like.
that childlike wonder.

1845
01:21:37.647 --> 01:21:39.983
He really wanted to get in
the best shape of his life

1846
01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:42.444
and he wanted this
to be his best run ever.

1847
01:21:42.485 --> 01:21:45.780
- He started talking to me
about what my ideas were

1848
01:21:45.822 --> 01:21:47.157
and if I should go back.

1849
01:21:47.198 --> 01:21:50.827
And I decided I was going
to pursue a conversation

1850
01:21:50.869 --> 01:21:54.372
with the company again
to see where I would stand

1851
01:21:54.414 --> 01:21:57.417
and started getting
excited again

1852
01:21:57.459 --> 01:22:01.129
like it was my first time
getting into the ring again.

1853
01:22:01.171 --> 01:22:04.883
- About the same time
I brought into the company

1854
01:22:04.924 --> 01:22:07.344
a guy named Rob Fee.

1855
01:22:07.385 --> 01:22:09.846
- I met with Hunter and Bray.

1856
01:22:09.888 --> 01:22:12.557
If I would ask him
a question and be like. hey.

1857
01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:15.060
what do you think about this
thing. an hour and a half

1858
01:22:15.101 --> 01:22:17.812
later of completely
off-the-wall ideas.

1859
01:22:17.854 --> 01:22:19.606
we'd land on something.

1860
01:22:19.647 --> 01:22:22.984
And I'm like. man. if he's
bringing this energy back

1861
01:22:23.026 --> 01:22:27.447
to WWE. it's going to be
a wild ride.

1862
01:22:27.489 --> 01:22:31.117
- It sort of started this kind
of three-way collaboration

1863
01:22:31.159 --> 01:22:33.078
on this project.

1864
01:22:33.119 --> 01:22:35.830
And Bray would
call us both and say.

1865
01:22:35.872 --> 01:22:38.041
hey. I have this idea.

1866
01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:45.131
[tense music]

1867
01:22:45.173 --> 01:22:51.680
* *

1868
01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:52.806
- Who...
- Killed...

1869
01:22:52.847 --> 01:22:55.266
- The...
- World?

1870
01:22:56.267 --> 01:22:58.895
- You...
- Did.

1871
01:22:58.937 --> 01:23:03.983
- We started coming up with
all these crazy. Easter-eggy--

1872
01:23:04.025 --> 01:23:09.322
like. how could we riff these
ideas to lead to this return?

1873
01:23:09.364 --> 01:23:11.574
That was me. Bray.

1874
01:23:11.616 --> 01:23:15.370
And Rob was
really instrumental.

1875
01:23:15.412 --> 01:23:20.500
- It was Bray coming up with
crazy bits of lore.

1876
01:23:20.542 --> 01:23:23.003
Then he'd be like. here.
make this into something.

1877
01:23:23.044 --> 01:23:28.633
- Friday Night SmackDown!

1878
01:23:28.675 --> 01:23:31.720
- Brought up
the first QR code.

1879
01:23:31.761 --> 01:23:35.015
It led to a puzzle.

1880
01:23:35.056 --> 01:23:36.349
I believe viewership was up

1881
01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:39.102
25% because people were

1882
01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:42.480
so excited to see
what this was leading to.

1883
01:23:42.522 --> 01:23:45.692
- The White Rabbit teases
are all that

1884
01:23:45.734 --> 01:23:48.236
any wrestling fan wants
to talk about.

1885
01:23:48.278 --> 01:23:51.614
It was so vague
and complicated that

1886
01:23:51.656 --> 01:23:57.370
it allowed us to just speculate
wildly for weeks at a time.

1887
01:23:57.412 --> 01:23:59.456
- We did rabbits in the crowd.

1888
01:23:59.497 --> 01:24:02.417
We had latitude and longitudes

1889
01:24:02.459 --> 01:24:04.419
in Italy that if you

1890
01:24:04.461 --> 01:24:05.420
viewed it from overhead.

1891
01:24:05.462 --> 01:24:07.881
was this giant pink bunny.

1892
01:24:07.922 --> 01:24:10.842
All the clues were just enough
to where it felt like

1893
01:24:10.884 --> 01:24:14.137
a Bray thing.
but it wasn't for sure.

1894
01:24:14.179 --> 01:24:17.349
The final one we did.
fire shoots out

1895
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:19.809
and it brings up the date
of Extreme Rules.

1896
01:24:19.851 --> 01:24:22.312
'Cause we were like.
at this point. you know.

1897
01:24:22.354 --> 01:24:24.314
let's stop [bleep] with them
and just show them

1898
01:24:24.356 --> 01:24:26.274
exactly what it is.

1899
01:24:28.068 --> 01:24:32.238
- October 8. 2022.

1900
01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.242
The day had finally arrived.

1901
01:24:36.284 --> 01:24:43.208
After 15 months.
Windham was home.

1902
01:24:43.249 --> 01:24:45.377
- I didn't know I could draw
a year ago.

1903
01:24:45.418 --> 01:24:47.253
You want to see something cool?

1904
01:24:47.295 --> 01:24:49.005
I was really proud of this.

1905
01:24:49.047 --> 01:24:52.342
It's the first time
I ever did this by myself.

1906
01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:54.928
This is the concept art.

1907
01:24:54.969 --> 01:24:57.597
Sitting at home for a year
by yourself and painting

1908
01:24:57.639 --> 01:25:00.350
and kind of. you know.
thinking about these things

1909
01:25:00.392 --> 01:25:02.602
and designing all these ideas

1910
01:25:02.644 --> 01:25:05.271
that I'm dreaming of--one day.
maybe we can get a chance

1911
01:25:05.313 --> 01:25:06.898
to do this stuff--

1912
01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:11.861
it's such a cool feeling
to be on the cusp of it.

1913
01:25:11.903 --> 01:25:14.447
This is always the most
exciting part for me.

1914
01:25:14.489 --> 01:25:16.908
this joy you get from creating.

1915
01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:19.953
And you're stressing me out
hovering over me

1916
01:25:19.994 --> 01:25:21.121
now that I'm doing it.

1917
01:25:21.162 --> 01:25:24.082
This is how I keep calm

1918
01:25:24.124 --> 01:25:26.876
kind of in
stressful situations.

1919
01:25:26.918 --> 01:25:28.378
[tense music]

1920
01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:31.172
- He was nervous. for sure.

1921
01:25:31.214 --> 01:25:33.299
I was not there
for Extreme Rules.

1922
01:25:33.341 --> 01:25:35.135
But I remember
he would call me

1923
01:25:35.176 --> 01:25:36.803
and he'd just be like. ugh.

1924
01:25:36.845 --> 01:25:40.890
He'd pace back
and forth constantly.

1925
01:25:40.932 --> 01:25:41.891
He was like. I can't.

1926
01:25:41.933 --> 01:25:42.976
I just can't right now.

1927
01:25:43.018 --> 01:25:44.144
And I'm like. OK.

1928
01:25:44.185 --> 01:25:47.939
But just to make sure
that it was

1929
01:25:47.981 --> 01:25:50.650
done the way
he wanted it to be done

1930
01:25:50.692 --> 01:25:53.278
was so much pressure on him
that it made him nervous.

1931
01:25:53.319 --> 01:25:55.947
He's like.
I got to do this right.

1932
01:25:55.989 --> 01:25:57.449
- I always think. oh. no.

1933
01:25:57.490 --> 01:25:58.825
so this person is not
going to like this.

1934
01:25:58.867 --> 01:26:01.619
This person is not
going to like that.

1935
01:26:03.872 --> 01:26:05.373
[booming]

1936
01:26:05.415 --> 01:26:12.339
- 15.944 WWE fans
are here tonight.

1937
01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:16.426
We are sold out
for Extreme Rules.

1938
01:26:16.468 --> 01:26:18.136
- I remember Hunter came
on the bus and was like.

1939
01:26:18.178 --> 01:26:19.888
we just think it'd be
kind of cool to just

1940
01:26:19.929 --> 01:26:22.349
show your characters
just sort of invaded back

1941
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:23.850
into the world of WWE.

1942
01:26:23.892 --> 01:26:26.311
And we're like. yeah.
sounds like a plan.

1943
01:26:26.353 --> 01:26:28.772
Bruce and Hunter are like.
we want The Fiend. as well.

1944
01:26:28.813 --> 01:26:31.399
We were just going to grab
a random extra or somebody.

1945
01:26:31.441 --> 01:26:32.817
And Windham goes. "No.

1946
01:26:32.859 --> 01:26:35.028
"Jason. you're
the only person I trust

1947
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:37.947
and you're the only person
that deserves to do it."

1948
01:26:37.989 --> 01:26:40.241
- You got this. man.

1949
01:26:40.283 --> 01:26:41.826
[laughs]

1950
01:26:41.868 --> 01:26:45.163
- The honor is definitely
not lost on me.

1951
01:26:45.205 --> 01:26:48.583
- You only get this a couple
times in your life. you know?

1952
01:26:48.625 --> 01:26:51.252
The feeling of pure bliss.
you know?

1953
01:26:51.294 --> 01:26:52.337
The nerves.

1954
01:26:52.379 --> 01:26:54.297
The bliss.

1955
01:26:54.339 --> 01:26:55.924
It's pretty wild. man.

1956
01:27:02.764 --> 01:27:05.058
I want to show everybody
what all the hard work is.

1957
01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.518
you know?

1958
01:27:06.559 --> 01:27:08.770
It's time. bro.

1959
01:27:09.562 --> 01:27:13.233
- Windham emerged
just 15 minutes before

1960
01:27:13.274 --> 01:27:15.902
his long-awaited return.

1961
01:27:19.906 --> 01:27:22.325
- They knew something was
going to happen on the show.

1962
01:27:22.367 --> 01:27:25.203
And this was after
the main event.

1963
01:27:25.245 --> 01:27:27.080
So you know. they're like.
did we miss something?

1964
01:27:27.122 --> 01:27:28.415
Was it wrong?

1965
01:27:28.456 --> 01:27:30.041
The logo comes up
at the bottom.

1966
01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:31.626
You think the show's over.

1967
01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:37.549
[cheers and applause]

1968
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:40.677
- Corey. are we still
on the air?

1969
01:27:41.302 --> 01:27:45.140
- * He's got the whole world *

1970
01:27:45.181 --> 01:27:47.017
[crowd roaring]

1971
01:27:47.058 --> 01:27:49.269
* In his hands *

1972
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:50.395
[eerie music]

1973
01:27:50.437 --> 01:27:53.106
- God. what the--

1974
01:27:53.148 --> 01:27:58.278
- * He's got
the whole wide world *

1975
01:27:58.319 --> 01:28:01.364
* In his hands *

1976
01:28:01.406 --> 01:28:03.742
* *

1977
01:28:03.783 --> 01:28:06.911
* He's got the whole world *

1978
01:28:06.953 --> 01:28:12.500
* In his hands *

1979
01:28:12.542 --> 01:28:16.880
* He's got the whole world *

1980
01:28:16.921 --> 01:28:19.549
[dramatic music]

1981
01:28:19.591 --> 01:28:21.676
* *

1982
01:28:21.718 --> 01:28:25.513
[cheers and applause]

1983
01:28:29.559 --> 01:28:33.104
all: Holy shit!
Holy shit! Holy shit!

1984
01:28:33.146 --> 01:28:37.150
Holy shit! Holy shit!

1985
01:28:37.192 --> 01:28:40.070
[crowd roaring]

1986
01:28:49.079 --> 01:28:52.582
[soft music]

1987
01:28:52.624 --> 01:28:54.167
- I don't think
I've ever experienced

1988
01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:56.169
a sensation quite like that.

1989
01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:58.213
I felt like I was just
hovering out there--

1990
01:28:58.254 --> 01:28:59.839
like I wasn't walking.

1991
01:28:59.881 --> 01:29:02.926
I've never felt
anything like it.

1992
01:29:02.967 --> 01:29:05.804
Bro. I seriously--like.
I'm on [bleep] edge right now.

1993
01:29:05.845 --> 01:29:09.432
I feel like I was just almost
in a car wreck. you know?

1994
01:29:09.474 --> 01:29:11.017
Holy shit.

1995
01:29:11.059 --> 01:29:13.645
- It literally blew the effing
roof off the place.

1996
01:29:13.687 --> 01:29:15.230
And I was like. holy cow.

1997
01:29:15.271 --> 01:29:17.691
It was a sight for sore eyes.

1998
01:29:17.732 --> 01:29:19.401
[laughs]

1999
01:29:19.442 --> 01:29:21.820
- We're going to make this way
bigger than it's ever been.

2000
01:29:21.861 --> 01:29:23.947
all right?
- I'm down.

2001
01:29:23.988 --> 01:29:26.533
- When you talk about blowing
the roof off of a place--

2002
01:29:26.574 --> 01:29:29.244
they may still be trying
to put it back on.

2003
01:29:29.285 --> 01:29:32.372
It was an explosion
when Bray returned.

2004
01:29:32.414 --> 01:29:33.790
They knew.

2005
01:29:33.832 --> 01:29:36.918
They wanted it.
then they got it.

2006
01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.461
* *

2007
01:29:38.503 --> 01:29:40.880
- Not everybody gets to spend
their 40th birthday

2008
01:29:40.922 --> 01:29:42.882
dressing up
as their best friend

2009
01:29:42.924 --> 01:29:44.509
and helping them
come back to their job.

2010
01:29:44.551 --> 01:29:49.264
* *

2011
01:29:49.305 --> 01:29:51.391
- Biggest thing in wrestling
in a very. very long time.

2012
01:29:51.433 --> 01:29:52.517
- Yeah.

2013
01:29:52.559 --> 01:29:54.185
I've never heard anything

2014
01:29:54.227 --> 01:29:56.479
that loud in my life.

2015
01:29:56.521 --> 01:29:57.731
It was insane.

2016
01:29:57.772 --> 01:30:00.233
- It was so cool.
It's just wild.

2017
01:30:00.275 --> 01:30:05.905
And just seeing this jacket
and his re-debut. coming back.

2018
01:30:05.947 --> 01:30:11.244
And he sparked a fire
under me like I never felt.

2019
01:30:11.286 --> 01:30:13.705
And it was all him.

2020
01:30:13.747 --> 01:30:15.415
- Part of professional
wrestling is

2021
01:30:15.457 --> 01:30:16.666
the theater of the mind.

2022
01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:19.210
It's to take you away
from reality.

2023
01:30:19.252 --> 01:30:21.254
And when you have a character
that you look forward

2024
01:30:21.296 --> 01:30:23.214
to seeing each week
and then they're gone.

2025
01:30:23.256 --> 01:30:25.133
you can't wait
to have that back.

2026
01:30:25.175 --> 01:30:28.011
There was something about him
that made people feel better.

2027
01:30:28.053 --> 01:30:31.389
And people missed
seeing that on TV.

2028
01:30:31.431 --> 01:30:34.559
[crowd chanting]

2029
01:30:40.190 --> 01:30:41.941
- [laughs]

2030
01:30:41.983 --> 01:30:43.735
I don't know if y'all
can read this on me.

2031
01:30:43.777 --> 01:30:47.113
but I am incredibly grateful.

2032
01:30:47.155 --> 01:30:50.075
And I'm really. really
nervous to be here.

2033
01:30:50.116 --> 01:30:51.993
I never thought that
this would happen.

2034
01:30:52.035 --> 01:30:53.953
[cheering]

2035
01:30:53.995 --> 01:30:55.997
[laughs]

2036
01:30:58.667 --> 01:31:01.252
This right here.
this is just me. OK?

2037
01:31:01.294 --> 01:31:03.963
This is a version of me
that I've never

2038
01:31:04.005 --> 01:31:06.758
got to introduce
to you guys before.

2039
01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.302
This is just me being me--

2040
01:31:09.344 --> 01:31:11.930
genuine me--for the first time.

2041
01:31:15.016 --> 01:31:16.893
- I felt like people were
just so grateful for him

2042
01:31:16.935 --> 01:31:18.228
and grateful to have him back.

2043
01:31:18.269 --> 01:31:20.980
And then that promo where
he was just kind of raw

2044
01:31:21.022 --> 01:31:25.443
and spoke more as Windham was
so unique and so different.

2045
01:31:25.485 --> 01:31:29.197
- I can sit here right now
today and I can look all of you

2046
01:31:29.239 --> 01:31:32.409
in the eyes and I can say
that you were there

2047
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:36.329
when I was weak. when I was
vulnerable. when I was down.

2048
01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:39.290
So I just wanted
to say thank you.

2049
01:31:39.332 --> 01:31:42.627
You all saved my life.

2050
01:31:42.669 --> 01:31:44.504
[cheers and applause]

2051
01:31:44.546 --> 01:31:46.006
- That's my favorite
Bray Wyatt promo.

2052
01:31:46.047 --> 01:31:48.133
Because not only do
they already love him

2053
01:31:48.174 --> 01:31:50.051
for his commitment
and for everything he's done

2054
01:31:50.093 --> 01:31:51.886
and for the rides
he's taken them on

2055
01:31:51.928 --> 01:31:54.681
with these different
characters all these years.

2056
01:31:54.723 --> 01:31:56.391
now they get to see
a window into him

2057
01:31:56.433 --> 01:31:58.893
as the actual person.

2058
01:31:58.935 --> 01:32:01.187
When he did that promo. I was
like. oh. now we're cooking.

2059
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:04.190
[crowd chanting]

2060
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:15.243
- He forgot how much
he meant to people.

2061
01:32:15.285 --> 01:32:18.830
When he got reminded of that
is what I loved.

2062
01:32:18.872 --> 01:32:20.915
[somber music]

2063
01:32:20.957 --> 01:32:23.793
- If I didn't have
such passionate fans.

2064
01:32:23.835 --> 01:32:24.919
I wouldn't be here.

2065
01:32:24.961 --> 01:32:26.504
I really wouldn't.

2066
01:32:26.546 --> 01:32:28.673
- What's the best part
about being a wrestler?

2067
01:32:28.715 --> 01:32:30.884
- The best part is--

2068
01:32:30.925 --> 01:32:32.719
you know.
this may sound corny.

2069
01:32:32.761 --> 01:32:35.305
but it's the truth--
is the fans.

2070
01:32:35.347 --> 01:32:38.892
To have fans that are
so into what I do.

2071
01:32:38.933 --> 01:32:40.810
it feels like it's part
of their life too.

2072
01:32:40.852 --> 01:32:43.646
[laughs]
- Oh. my God.

2073
01:32:43.688 --> 01:32:46.066
- Are you trying to scare me?

2074
01:32:46.107 --> 01:32:48.526
It's them that led me
back here.

2075
01:32:48.568 --> 01:32:50.528
This is the best
I've ever felt.

2076
01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:53.865
* *

2077
01:32:53.907 --> 01:32:56.618
- He felt like he was
getting a second chance.

2078
01:32:56.659 --> 01:32:58.828
and he had a lot
more perspective

2079
01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:00.914
on what that could be.

2080
01:33:00.955 --> 01:33:05.210
And so he was excited
to bring as much of himself

2081
01:33:05.251 --> 01:33:07.379
into that character.

2082
01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:13.301
- Bray wanted to take
the audience on a journey.

2083
01:33:13.343 --> 01:33:14.344
Here I am.

2084
01:33:14.386 --> 01:33:16.262
I'm Windham Rotunda.

2085
01:33:16.304 --> 01:33:19.766
I'm just a regular guy
just like you.

2086
01:33:19.808 --> 01:33:21.309
But yet. I'm different.

2087
01:33:21.351 --> 01:33:23.019
[dramatic music]

2088
01:33:23.061 --> 01:33:27.691
- My emotions. they don't work
like most other people's.

2089
01:33:27.732 --> 01:33:29.317
I don't have control.

2090
01:33:29.359 --> 01:33:34.823
And sometimes. they can send me
to a very. very dark place.

2091
01:33:34.864 --> 01:33:37.575
- Bray Wyatt once had
a family.

2092
01:33:37.617 --> 01:33:40.578
The Fiend had his Fun House.

2093
01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:46.209
But this time.
Windham needed someone else--

2094
01:33:46.251 --> 01:33:49.045
his brother.

2095
01:33:49.087 --> 01:33:51.297
- We wanted to use Taylor
all along.

2096
01:33:51.339 --> 01:33:54.300
And I thought it was
a pretty cool concept.

2097
01:33:54.342 --> 01:33:56.469
- The whole thing came
from this nightmare

2098
01:33:56.511 --> 01:33:58.304
that he used to have
when he was a child

2099
01:33:58.346 --> 01:34:00.390
that would haunt him
in his dreams.

2100
01:34:00.432 --> 01:34:02.684
That was the catalyst
to create

2101
01:34:02.726 --> 01:34:04.269
the Uncle Howdy look
and design.

2102
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:07.188
* *

2103
01:34:07.230 --> 01:34:10.650
- To be able to freely work
with him for the first time

2104
01:34:10.692 --> 01:34:14.779
as colleagues and as brothers.
it was like a dream come true.

2105
01:34:14.821 --> 01:34:16.197
Windham had already
accomplished

2106
01:34:16.239 --> 01:34:18.533
the most unbelievable things

2107
01:34:18.575 --> 01:34:20.160
you could do in this business.

2108
01:34:20.201 --> 01:34:24.539
And his only goal left
was to do it together.

2109
01:34:24.581 --> 01:34:26.166
[somber music]

2110
01:34:26.207 --> 01:34:30.045
We were both becoming
monsters.

2111
01:34:30.086 --> 01:34:33.131
I was going to work just
to hang out with my brother.

2112
01:34:33.173 --> 01:34:35.175
That was my job.

2113
01:34:35.216 --> 01:34:39.095
You know.
and to play with my brother.

2114
01:34:39.137 --> 01:34:40.680
- What is that thing?

2115
01:34:40.722 --> 01:34:43.725
- Oh. that's Uncle Howdy.

2116
01:34:44.726 --> 01:34:47.771
- Being two little kids again.
developing the characters.

2117
01:34:47.812 --> 01:34:50.065
and coming up
with ideas for them

2118
01:34:50.106 --> 01:34:53.443
to be able to work together
and complement each other

2119
01:34:53.485 --> 01:34:55.737
was awesome.

2120
01:34:55.779 --> 01:34:59.491
- Uncle Howdy just launched
himself off the top!

2121
01:35:01.076 --> 01:35:03.787
- We're going to be
in WrestleMania together.

2122
01:35:03.828 --> 01:35:06.539
We always had that dream.

2123
01:35:06.581 --> 01:35:09.959
And that dream never changed.

2124
01:35:10.001 --> 01:35:13.713
It only got stronger
and more real.

2125
01:35:13.755 --> 01:35:17.842
That time period where
we were working together...

2126
01:35:17.884 --> 01:35:20.136
- And Sister Abigail!

2127
01:35:20.178 --> 01:35:22.889
- It meant everything to me.

2128
01:35:22.931 --> 01:35:24.933
- You're welcome. Montreal.

2129
01:35:24.974 --> 01:35:27.602
[cheers and applause]

2130
01:35:27.644 --> 01:35:29.479
- It was too good to be true.

2131
01:35:29.521 --> 01:35:31.481
* *

2132
01:35:31.523 --> 01:35:32.982
- All of a sudden.
he had this. like.

2133
01:35:33.024 --> 01:35:34.984
second lease on life.

2134
01:35:35.026 --> 01:35:37.278
Man. it came out
of everything he did--

2135
01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:38.863
the joy of it.

2136
01:35:38.905 --> 01:35:43.243
And you know. as we were doing
it. sometimes. we would talk.

2137
01:35:43.284 --> 01:35:46.663
and then we'd get done
an hour of creative whatever.

2138
01:35:46.705 --> 01:35:48.873
And then he'd call me back
two seconds later and be like.

2139
01:35:48.915 --> 01:35:50.917
hey. man. I just want you to
know how much this means to me

2140
01:35:50.959 --> 01:35:52.335
and how much fun I'm having.

2141
01:35:52.377 --> 01:35:54.963
And it made me want
to work harder for him.

2142
01:35:55.005 --> 01:35:56.881
It made me want to run
through a wall for him

2143
01:35:56.923 --> 01:35:59.926
to get this stuff done and to
get it where it needed to be.

2144
01:35:59.968 --> 01:36:03.013
[tense music]

2145
01:36:03.054 --> 01:36:07.642
- February 26. 2023.

2146
01:36:07.684 --> 01:36:09.602
- Here I'm getting to stand
across from a guy

2147
01:36:09.644 --> 01:36:15.066
who had really built a name
and a whole aura for himself.

2148
01:36:15.108 --> 01:36:17.902
That's huge.

2149
01:36:17.944 --> 01:36:20.947
He said that his calf
or his knee started to. like.

2150
01:36:20.989 --> 01:36:22.032
seize up or something.

2151
01:36:22.073 --> 01:36:23.033
And I was like. are you good?

2152
01:36:23.074 --> 01:36:24.367
Are you good?

2153
01:36:24.409 --> 01:36:25.952
And it was just like.
all right. well.

2154
01:36:25.994 --> 01:36:28.038
we were trying to work
as best we could

2155
01:36:28.079 --> 01:36:30.081
to kind of protect him.

2156
01:36:32.334 --> 01:36:34.878
- Nobody knew at the time--

2157
01:36:34.919 --> 01:36:37.672
not even Windham Rotunda--

2158
01:36:37.714 --> 01:36:42.552
that he had just completed
his final match.

2159
01:36:46.014 --> 01:36:46.973
[tense music]

2160
01:36:47.015 --> 01:36:49.309
- March 2023.

2161
01:36:49.351 --> 01:36:51.353
The Bray Wyatt character
was suddenly

2162
01:36:51.394 --> 01:36:55.357
absent from WWE programming.

2163
01:36:55.398 --> 01:36:59.736
- I was at TV and found out
Windham wasn't there.

2164
01:36:59.778 --> 01:37:01.905
And I called him like.
where are you at?

2165
01:37:01.946 --> 01:37:04.616
And he was at home.
He had COVID.

2166
01:37:04.657 --> 01:37:06.701
- He went to the hospital.

2167
01:37:06.743 --> 01:37:08.244
He tested positive for COVID.

2168
01:37:08.286 --> 01:37:09.913
They were like. oh. my God.
They admitted him.

2169
01:37:09.954 --> 01:37:11.498
His heart.

2170
01:37:11.539 --> 01:37:16.503
* *

2171
01:37:16.544 --> 01:37:19.964
He had to go do stress
and echocardiograms

2172
01:37:20.006 --> 01:37:23.176
through this period of time.

2173
01:37:23.218 --> 01:37:24.636
- It was a weakened heart.

2174
01:37:24.678 --> 01:37:27.681
It was like. the way his heart
performed and functioned.

2175
01:37:27.722 --> 01:37:30.725
it was not where
it needed to be.

2176
01:37:30.767 --> 01:37:32.644
It kept making him feel off.

2177
01:37:32.686 --> 01:37:35.647
He kept saying. I feel off.

2178
01:37:35.689 --> 01:37:38.483
- I didn't think
it was that serious.

2179
01:37:38.525 --> 01:37:40.860
I mean. to me.
he's my big brother.

2180
01:37:40.902 --> 01:37:42.696
Nothing can hurt him.

2181
01:37:42.737 --> 01:37:44.322
* *

2182
01:37:44.364 --> 01:37:46.449
- He didn't share
too many details.

2183
01:37:46.491 --> 01:37:48.576
He just always wanted to assure
everybody that he was fine--

2184
01:37:48.618 --> 01:37:50.036
I'm fine.

2185
01:37:50.078 --> 01:37:53.540
But I could see that
he didn't feel amazing.

2186
01:37:53.581 --> 01:37:55.208
- He worked with
a cardiologist.

2187
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:56.668
And he was on medication.

2188
01:37:56.710 --> 01:38:01.297
He was already cleared
to work out. but not a lot.

2189
01:38:01.339 --> 01:38:05.427
They'd say just light cardio
was fine. so he would do that.

2190
01:38:05.468 --> 01:38:07.178
He was doing a little
bit better and then

2191
01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:08.596
it kept getting better
and better and better.

2192
01:38:08.638 --> 01:38:11.349
And then a couple times.
it kind of backtracked.

2193
01:38:13.643 --> 01:38:16.563
- My sister. she was staying
at his guest house.

2194
01:38:16.604 --> 01:38:18.189
And when she walked
in the garage.

2195
01:38:18.231 --> 01:38:19.983
there was a rattlesnake.

2196
01:38:20.025 --> 01:38:22.110
So we freaked out
and drove there.

2197
01:38:22.152 --> 01:38:26.531
And we had to lift up
some stuff and get to it.

2198
01:38:26.573 --> 01:38:30.410
And afterwards--
he always sweated.

2199
01:38:30.452 --> 01:38:33.246
but it was more than that.
and in his eyes.

2200
01:38:33.288 --> 01:38:35.290
And he said. I don't feel good.

2201
01:38:35.331 --> 01:38:36.958
I just got to take a nap.

2202
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.086
And it was. like.
3:00 in the afternoon.

2203
01:38:40.128 --> 01:38:44.674
And it crossed my mind.

2204
01:38:44.716 --> 01:38:47.010
And I worried for him
because he's my brother.

2205
01:38:47.052 --> 01:38:48.762
In that moment.
I go. are you OK?

2206
01:38:48.803 --> 01:38:50.096
And I asked him then.

2207
01:38:50.138 --> 01:38:51.848
Yeah. yeah. I'm fine.

2208
01:38:51.890 --> 01:38:53.558
But I never really worried.

2209
01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:57.604
I never thought.
oh. Windham is really sick.

2210
01:38:57.645 --> 01:38:59.064
Never for a second.

2211
01:38:59.105 --> 01:39:02.609
I was just waiting for the call
to come back as monsters

2212
01:39:02.650 --> 01:39:04.027
like we both wanted.

2213
01:39:04.069 --> 01:39:07.072
* *

2214
01:39:07.113 --> 01:39:08.782
- He was still under
the doctor's care.

2215
01:39:08.823 --> 01:39:12.452
And we were right there
to where. oh. he's fine.

2216
01:39:12.494 --> 01:39:15.121
He should be able
to go back soon.

2217
01:39:15.163 --> 01:39:17.374
But he didn't feel good.

2218
01:39:17.415 --> 01:39:21.795
And they set him up
with a vest that

2219
01:39:21.836 --> 01:39:26.633
was actually to where it
would shock him if he stopped.

2220
01:39:26.675 --> 01:39:30.136
And they released him
from the hospital with that.

2221
01:39:30.178 --> 01:39:31.346
and he swore he would wear it.

2222
01:39:31.388 --> 01:39:32.639
Mike and I picked him up
at the hospital

2223
01:39:32.681 --> 01:39:34.099
and brought him home.

2224
01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:37.394
We watched it get fitted
and everything. and he wore it.

2225
01:39:37.435 --> 01:39:43.191
And then he went for
the follow-up with his doctor.

2226
01:39:46.027 --> 01:39:49.364
- Thursday. August 24.

2227
01:39:49.406 --> 01:39:52.534
Windham had a morning checkup
with his doctor.

2228
01:39:52.575 --> 01:39:55.912
- He called me and he said.
probably. at some point.

2229
01:39:55.954 --> 01:39:58.289
I'm going to have to do
a pacemaker or something.

2230
01:39:58.331 --> 01:40:01.501
So he didn't tell me there
was good news or bad news.

2231
01:40:01.543 --> 01:40:03.878
but he was--

2232
01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:05.922
Ma. I'm going to be fine.

2233
01:40:05.964 --> 01:40:07.632
- It was that morning.

2234
01:40:07.674 --> 01:40:09.718
I had called him
and he answered the phone.

2235
01:40:09.759 --> 01:40:11.594
And he was like.
hey. what's up Sam?

2236
01:40:11.636 --> 01:40:13.972
I said. well. do you want to
get the kids from school today?

2237
01:40:14.014 --> 01:40:15.348
And he was like.
I would love that.

2238
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:16.975
Yeah. I'm going to pick
the kids up from school.

2239
01:40:17.017 --> 01:40:18.351
I said. OK. cool.

2240
01:40:18.393 --> 01:40:20.562
I think this was. like.
10:00 in the morning.

2241
01:40:20.603 --> 01:40:23.273
- He walks in the house.
he's excited.

2242
01:40:23.314 --> 01:40:25.191
Just. hey. guys. what's up?

2243
01:40:25.233 --> 01:40:27.068
All the kids jumping on him
and everything.

2244
01:40:27.110 --> 01:40:29.529
So he was just
really. really happy.

2245
01:40:29.571 --> 01:40:32.032
And he's like.
I'm going to go take a nap.

2246
01:40:32.073 --> 01:40:33.491
And I was like.
all right. cool.

2247
01:40:33.533 --> 01:40:35.201
He goes to sleep
around 2:00 PM.

2248
01:40:35.243 --> 01:40:38.371
[tense music]

2249
01:40:38.413 --> 01:40:39.998
So I'm doing my thing
in the kitchen.

2250
01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.541
My mom's there.

2251
01:40:41.583 --> 01:40:44.878
And then his alarm
starts going off at 3:00.

2252
01:40:44.919 --> 01:40:47.339
And so then I walked over
and I was like. babe.

2253
01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:48.840
your alarm's going off.

2254
01:40:48.882 --> 01:40:52.677
And then I touched his leg.
and he wouldn't move.

2255
01:40:52.719 --> 01:40:55.889
And so then like I started
shaking him and hitting him.

2256
01:40:55.930 --> 01:40:57.182
and he wouldn't move.

2257
01:40:57.223 --> 01:40:59.934
And so I screamed for my mom.

2258
01:40:59.976 --> 01:41:01.311
* *

2259
01:41:01.353 --> 01:41:03.730
I call 911 immediately.

2260
01:41:03.772 --> 01:41:07.317
In the meantime.
my mom is calling his mom.

2261
01:41:07.359 --> 01:41:09.569
* *

2262
01:41:09.611 --> 01:41:11.404
- She's screaming. Windham's
having a heart attack.

2263
01:41:11.446 --> 01:41:12.822
Windham's having
a heart attack.

2264
01:41:12.864 --> 01:41:14.741
And I'm like.
no. no. no. no. no.

2265
01:41:14.783 --> 01:41:15.742
Put him on the phone.

2266
01:41:15.784 --> 01:41:17.202
Put him on the phone.

2267
01:41:17.243 --> 01:41:20.580
And I immediately
called Taylor.

2268
01:41:20.622 --> 01:41:22.248
- She said she didn't know
the details.

2269
01:41:22.290 --> 01:41:24.417
He just stopped breathing.

2270
01:41:24.459 --> 01:41:28.004
- I'm following them
with him in the gurney.

2271
01:41:28.046 --> 01:41:30.423
And I kept yelling at him.

2272
01:41:30.465 --> 01:41:32.092
I'm like. please
just come back to me.

2273
01:41:32.133 --> 01:41:35.845
I'm like.
please just come back to me.

2274
01:41:35.887 --> 01:41:39.140
[somber music]

2275
01:41:39.182 --> 01:41:41.226
- My car was in the shop.

2276
01:41:41.267 --> 01:41:43.019
so I had to call Taylor
and say. Taylor.

2277
01:41:43.061 --> 01:41:45.563
I need you to come get me
and the baby now.

2278
01:41:45.605 --> 01:41:48.066
And I remember getting
my baby dressed.

2279
01:41:48.108 --> 01:41:51.403
And I just kept saying to her.
everything's going to be OK.

2280
01:41:51.444 --> 01:41:53.905
Everything's going to be OK.

2281
01:41:53.947 --> 01:41:59.244
And in the back of my mind.
I just knew it's not OK.

2282
01:41:59.285 --> 01:42:01.204
* *

2283
01:42:01.246 --> 01:42:02.455
- As soon as we walked in.

2284
01:42:02.497 --> 01:42:05.500
they pulled us
in a room alone.

2285
01:42:07.085 --> 01:42:08.586
The doctor walked in.

2286
01:42:08.628 --> 01:42:14.843
And it's like something you see

2287
01:42:14.884 --> 01:42:18.638
a million times in movies.

2288
01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:20.849
but you really don't know
what it feels like

2289
01:42:20.890 --> 01:42:23.435
until it happens.

2290
01:42:27.981 --> 01:42:32.610
He said. we got bad news.

2291
01:42:35.739 --> 01:42:38.283
He's gone.

2292
01:42:38.324 --> 01:42:42.579
And it's like time slowed down.

2293
01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:47.167
I could see the reaction
of everybody in the room.

2294
01:42:47.208 --> 01:42:49.586
My mom and dad crumbling.

2295
01:42:49.627 --> 01:42:53.923
And my sister. she's got her
baby wrapped to her chest

2296
01:42:53.965 --> 01:42:55.508
and she's falling.

2297
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:59.304
And I've never been more sad.

2298
01:42:59.346 --> 01:43:02.057
But something in me--

2299
01:43:02.098 --> 01:43:06.811
and I still to this day
think it was Windham--

2300
01:43:06.853 --> 01:43:09.856
something in me gave me
the strength to go. stop.

2301
01:43:09.898 --> 01:43:14.694
You need to hold them up.

2302
01:43:14.736 --> 01:43:20.367
He gave me strength
in a moment where

2303
01:43:20.408 --> 01:43:22.869
I would think I would crumble.

2304
01:43:22.911 --> 01:43:27.916
And I really believe
it was him.

2305
01:43:27.957 --> 01:43:33.296
And he was telling me.
be there for Mom.

2306
01:43:33.338 --> 01:43:35.340
Hold her up.

2307
01:43:38.176 --> 01:43:40.970
- Taylor had to pick me up
off the floor

2308
01:43:41.012 --> 01:43:47.143
and I just remember
his hands felt so big.

2309
01:43:47.185 --> 01:43:51.106
He just held me. picked me up.

2310
01:43:51.147 --> 01:43:52.857
There was nothing we could do.

2311
01:43:52.899 --> 01:43:57.404
It was absolute disbelief
that this isn't happening.

2312
01:43:57.445 --> 01:43:59.406
This is not real.

2313
01:43:59.447 --> 01:44:01.282
And I kept looking
at Mike going.

2314
01:44:01.324 --> 01:44:03.243
Mike. you got to do something.

2315
01:44:03.284 --> 01:44:05.078
Fix this. Fix this now.

2316
01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:07.455
* *

2317
01:44:07.497 --> 01:44:10.041
- It was just heartbreaking.

2318
01:44:10.083 --> 01:44:14.295
Somebody sticking their fist
in your chest

2319
01:44:14.337 --> 01:44:17.424
and pulling your heart out.

2320
01:44:17.465 --> 01:44:19.551
- My sister called me.

2321
01:44:19.592 --> 01:44:22.554
And all she said was...

2322
01:44:26.808 --> 01:44:28.810
Windham is gone.

2323
01:44:31.354 --> 01:44:33.440
- My phone rang when I was
sitting on the plane.

2324
01:44:33.481 --> 01:44:35.442
And I answered it.

2325
01:44:35.483 --> 01:44:39.654
and JoJo said. he's gone.

2326
01:44:39.696 --> 01:44:42.365
And I said.
what do you mean he's gone?

2327
01:44:42.407 --> 01:44:44.075
He's dead.

2328
01:44:44.117 --> 01:44:48.788
And I literally was
walking off the airplane.

2329
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:51.499
I dropped to my knees
on the jet bridge.

2330
01:44:51.541 --> 01:44:53.752
And I just--

2331
01:44:57.005 --> 01:45:01.676
I felt like. all of a sudden.
something was missing from me.

2332
01:45:01.718 --> 01:45:03.595
- I got a phone call.
and it was Jo.

2333
01:45:03.636 --> 01:45:07.015
She goes. Windham's gone.

2334
01:45:11.478 --> 01:45:14.314
And I screamed.

2335
01:45:14.356 --> 01:45:15.690
- All I could think about is.

2336
01:45:15.732 --> 01:45:18.276
how am I going to tell
my children--

2337
01:45:18.318 --> 01:45:20.820
they're three and four--
that they just lost their dad?

2338
01:45:20.862 --> 01:45:23.114
* *

2339
01:45:23.156 --> 01:45:25.992
- People say like.
it was a nightmare.

2340
01:45:26.034 --> 01:45:28.536
But you don't know what
that feels like until

2341
01:45:28.578 --> 01:45:31.081
you live a nightmare.

2342
01:45:31.122 --> 01:45:35.043
- It was and will forever be

2343
01:45:35.085 --> 01:45:38.171
the worst day of my life.

2344
01:45:38.213 --> 01:45:40.173
* *

2345
01:45:40.215 --> 01:45:43.134
- He didn't have the vest on.

2346
01:45:43.176 --> 01:45:46.846
Don't know what happened.

2347
01:45:46.888 --> 01:45:48.640
* *

2348
01:45:48.682 --> 01:45:53.228
- Windham Rotunda passed away.

2349
01:45:53.269 --> 01:45:56.231
He was 36 years old.

2350
01:45:56.272 --> 01:46:01.695
* *

2351
01:46:01.736 --> 01:46:04.823
Just 24 hours after
Windham's passing.

2352
01:46:04.864 --> 01:46:07.325
WWE's Friday Night
SmackDown program

2353
01:46:07.367 --> 01:46:11.496
was set to air live
from Louisville. Kentucky.

2354
01:46:15.125 --> 01:46:17.836
Life is short.

2355
01:46:17.877 --> 01:46:22.298
This doesn't tell you
anything else.

2356
01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:24.426
It's short.

2357
01:46:25.719 --> 01:46:28.430
It still feels--
it's still surreal.

2358
01:46:28.471 --> 01:46:29.973
I still feel like I just

2359
01:46:30.015 --> 01:46:32.976
haven't seen him
for a little while. you know.

2360
01:46:33.018 --> 01:46:39.357
because he was so
larger-than-life as a person

2361
01:46:39.399 --> 01:46:46.031
and so big personality-wise
and everything was so good.

2362
01:46:46.072 --> 01:46:51.953
And for somebody that young.
it's just a crazy--

2363
01:46:54.789 --> 01:46:57.500
I don't know how
to put it into words.

2364
01:46:57.542 --> 01:46:59.252
36 years old.

2365
01:46:59.294 --> 01:47:00.378
Cherish it.

2366
01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:02.339
Cherish each other.

2367
01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:05.258
- Sitting here doing this
whole thing about Windham.

2368
01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:08.678
and even now. there's still
a huge part of me

2369
01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.263
that's in total denial.

2370
01:47:10.305 --> 01:47:12.223
You know what I mean?

2371
01:47:17.562 --> 01:47:20.231
Yeah.

2372
01:47:20.273 --> 01:47:23.860
- I just didn't believe it.

2373
01:47:23.902 --> 01:47:25.612
I just thought it was bullshit.

2374
01:47:25.653 --> 01:47:28.406
I just thought it wasn't real.

2375
01:47:28.448 --> 01:47:31.201
Sometimes. even now.
I still don't think it's real.

2376
01:47:34.162 --> 01:47:35.497
Yeah. I don't know.

2377
01:47:35.538 --> 01:47:37.999
It sucked. It still sucks.

2378
01:47:41.211 --> 01:47:43.588
- Everything we wanted to do

2379
01:47:43.630 --> 01:47:48.009
was a tribute to Bray.

2380
01:47:49.344 --> 01:47:51.846
Just to say thank you.

2381
01:47:54.474 --> 01:47:57.602
[bell dinging]

2382
01:48:07.946 --> 01:48:10.824
- Just a barrage of different
feelings in my head.

2383
01:48:13.201 --> 01:48:15.745
I miss him.

2384
01:48:15.787 --> 01:48:21.167
- He was just a light
in everyone's lives.

2385
01:48:21.209 --> 01:48:24.754
- He was one of the greatest
people I've ever met.

2386
01:48:24.796 --> 01:48:26.423
And I wouldn't be
where I am in my life

2387
01:48:26.464 --> 01:48:28.341
without meeting him.

2388
01:48:28.383 --> 01:48:31.469
I miss you. I miss you.

2389
01:48:31.511 --> 01:48:35.515
* *

2390
01:48:35.557 --> 01:48:38.059
- He touched a lot of people.

2391
01:48:38.101 --> 01:48:39.769
* *

2392
01:48:39.811 --> 01:48:43.023
He was loved by millions.

2393
01:48:43.064 --> 01:48:46.151
* *

2394
01:48:46.192 --> 01:48:49.529
- Windham's sudden passing
left the entire WWE Universe

2395
01:48:49.571 --> 01:48:52.073
in shock.

2396
01:48:52.115 --> 01:48:55.118
Honoring his legacy
would be a tall task.

2397
01:48:59.581 --> 01:49:01.416
all: Thank you. Bray!
Thank you. Bray!

2398
01:49:01.458 --> 01:49:04.377
Thank you. Bray!
Thank you. Bray!

2399
01:49:04.419 --> 01:49:08.840
- Following Windham's passing.
in arenas across the country.

2400
01:49:08.882 --> 01:49:14.012
superstars and fans paid
tribute to Bray Wyatt.

2401
01:49:14.054 --> 01:49:17.349
- I know that all of you
can feel the spirit

2402
01:49:17.390 --> 01:49:19.267
of Bray Wyatt in this building.

2403
01:49:19.309 --> 01:49:21.895
[cheers and applause]

2404
01:49:21.936 --> 01:49:24.898
- That was the one time
where I kind of struggled.

2405
01:49:24.939 --> 01:49:26.566
It started to break me.

2406
01:49:26.608 --> 01:49:28.985
I had to look at the ceiling
to keep everything together.

2407
01:49:29.027 --> 01:49:31.321
and just big deep breath.

2408
01:49:31.363 --> 01:49:33.531
- This one is for Windham.

Hug the ones that you love.

2410
01:49:35.909 --> 01:49:37.577
He was a special human being.

2411
01:49:37.619 --> 01:49:39.245
He was a good human being.

2412
01:49:39.287 --> 01:49:42.040
There's just not very many
people like Windham Rotunda.

2413
01:49:42.082 --> 01:49:44.959
There's nobody
like Windham Rotunda.

2414
01:49:45.001 --> 01:49:48.338
- I'll always think of him
for the rest of my career

2415
01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:51.591
every single time
I see these fireflies.

2416
01:49:51.633 --> 01:49:55.845
[cheers and applause]

2417
01:49:55.887 --> 01:49:57.597
It was the only therapy
that I was able

2418
01:49:57.639 --> 01:50:00.642
to get was in that ring.

2419
01:50:00.684 --> 01:50:04.979
He was truly a beautiful soul
inside of the ring and out.

2420
01:50:05.021 --> 01:50:09.192
- It was touching to see
so many people care

2421
01:50:09.234 --> 01:50:12.821
and know that he touched
so many people.

2422
01:50:12.862 --> 01:50:17.992
- He really touched lives
from all over the world.

2423
01:50:18.034 --> 01:50:19.994
- It was just overwhelming--

2424
01:50:20.036 --> 01:50:24.666
really overwhelming to see
how much he was loved.

2425
01:50:24.708 --> 01:50:27.293
I was like. wow.

2426
01:50:27.335 --> 01:50:28.712
Wow.

2427
01:50:28.753 --> 01:50:30.005
He was loved.

2428
01:50:33.967 --> 01:50:37.804
[soft music]

2429
01:50:37.846 --> 01:50:40.390
- September 6th.

2430
01:50:40.432 --> 01:50:42.767
Two weeks after
Windham's passing.

2431
01:50:42.809 --> 01:50:44.936
a service was held
in his hometown

2432
01:50:44.978 --> 01:50:47.814
of Brooksville. Florida.

2433
01:50:47.856 --> 01:50:50.984
- To go and plan
your son's funeral

2434
01:50:51.026 --> 01:50:53.820
is the worst thing
in the world.

2435
01:50:53.862 --> 01:50:56.489
It was the hardest thing
in the world.

2436

* *

2437
01:50:58.575 --> 01:51:02.537
- We wanted it to be very
Windham down to his urn.

2438
01:51:02.579 --> 01:51:03.788
Very much like him.

2439
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:06.332
And it's a flame.

2440
01:51:06.374 --> 01:51:09.669
- The smoke going off
and the red lights.

2441
01:51:09.711 --> 01:51:11.379
it was a Windham funeral.

2442
01:51:11.421 --> 01:51:13.798
And it made me smile.

2443
01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:16.926
- Seeing everyone together--
how important he was

2444
01:51:16.968 --> 01:51:18.887
to so many people--

2445
01:51:18.928 --> 01:51:22.849
that speaks volumes
for the man that he was.

2446
01:51:22.891 --> 01:51:24.517
- I did get to go
to the funeral.

2447
01:51:24.559 --> 01:51:27.395
And there was
some closure there.

2448
01:51:27.437 --> 01:51:31.024
But at the same time.
how can there be closure

2449
01:51:31.066 --> 01:51:35.737
on a guy who was just stepping
into his prime. really?

2450
01:51:37.864 --> 01:51:42.660
- I was hurting more that day
than I ever thought possible.

2451
01:51:42.702 --> 01:51:45.121
I really don't know how
I'm going to get through this.

2452
01:51:45.163 --> 01:51:51.336
But I know Windham would
have done this for me.

2453
01:51:51.378 --> 01:51:55.423
and he would have
ended up killing it.

2454
01:51:55.465 --> 01:51:57.384
He really would have.

2455
01:51:57.425 --> 01:52:03.390
He wasn't just my big brother
or my best friend.

2456
01:52:03.431 --> 01:52:06.851
He was my idol.

2457
01:52:06.893 --> 01:52:08.645
- Windham was
Taylor's superhero.

2458
01:52:08.687 --> 01:52:11.940
The eulogy that Taylor gave
at Windham's service

2459
01:52:11.981 --> 01:52:15.568
was unbelievable.

2460
01:52:15.610 --> 01:52:19.989
- He is and always will be
the most beautiful.

2461
01:52:20.031 --> 01:52:24.536
amazing person I've ever known.

2462
01:52:24.577 --> 01:52:27.664
I love you so much. Windham.

2463
01:52:27.706 --> 01:52:29.249
- I could feel
Windham's comfort

2464
01:52:29.290 --> 01:52:31.793
as I stood up there to speak.

2465
01:52:31.835 --> 01:52:33.962
A couple months ago.
I had this unique opportunity.

2466
01:52:34.004 --> 01:52:37.549
My dad actually asked me
to do it.

2467
01:52:37.590 --> 01:52:39.426
He's working on a book.

2468
01:52:39.467 --> 01:52:43.555
And he said. you know.
set something up with the boys

2469
01:52:43.596 --> 01:52:46.224
and interview them
and get some transcripts.

2470
01:52:46.266 --> 01:52:48.435
Just talking about
our family and the values

2471
01:52:48.476 --> 01:52:49.853
and how we grew up.

2473
01:52:51.563 --> 01:52:53.606
I had no idea that
Windham was going to tell us

2474
01:52:53.648 --> 01:52:57.068
how he wanted to be remembered.

2475
01:52:57.110 --> 01:52:59.446
- I want to leave a mark
that makes me

2476
01:52:59.487 --> 01:53:02.574
a first-ballot Hall of Famer
and makes all my kids proud.

2477
01:53:02.615 --> 01:53:04.909
But honestly.
at the end of the day.

2478
01:53:04.951 --> 01:53:06.911
when I go into the dirt.

2479
01:53:06.953 --> 01:53:09.456
I think that
I will be remembered

2480
01:53:09.497 --> 01:53:11.666
for far more things
than just wrestling.

2481
01:53:11.708 --> 01:53:15.337
Making sure that my kids
and JoJo. everybody.

2482
01:53:15.378 --> 01:53:17.047
that they know
they can count on me

2483
01:53:17.088 --> 01:53:19.883
and that I will be there
for them no matter what.

2484
01:53:19.924 --> 01:53:23.136

2485
01:53:23.178 --> 01:53:29.476
- Windham was gone.
but his ideas live on.

2486
01:53:29.517 --> 01:53:33.188
He still has
one final creation

2487
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:35.648
to share with the world.

2488
01:53:35.690 --> 01:53:37.692

2489
01:53:37.734 --> 01:53:39.652
- He was here a bunch.

2490
01:53:39.694 --> 01:53:41.946
He came. like. three
or four times over the summer

2491
01:53:41.988 --> 01:53:43.156
spitballing ideas--

2492
01:53:43.198 --> 01:53:45.367
I want to do this.
I want to do that.

2493
01:53:45.408 --> 01:53:48.828
And from there. we started
working on the new Fiend.

2494
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:50.830
We made the new lantern.

2495
01:53:50.872 --> 01:53:52.248
We threw a little
animatronics in there

2496
01:53:52.290 --> 01:53:54.876
so the eyes move
back and forth.

2497
01:53:56.294 --> 01:53:59.214
We made the new mask.
started talking about gear.

2498
01:53:59.255 --> 01:54:00.507
Windham always wanted
something new.

2499
01:54:00.548 --> 01:54:02.217
something fresh.
something different.

2500
01:54:02.258 --> 01:54:05.679
What would the next evolution
of The Fiend be?

2501
01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:08.682
[soft music]

2502
01:54:08.723 --> 01:54:11.476

2503
01:54:11.518 --> 01:54:15.063
* *

2504
01:54:15.105 --> 01:54:17.565
We 3D sculpted
a body form of Windham.

2505
01:54:17.607 --> 01:54:19.776
The mask had already
been approved by Windham.

2506
01:54:19.818 --> 01:54:22.237
This jacket was actually
something he had purchased.

2507
01:54:22.278 --> 01:54:24.864
and his mother and father
had sent it to us.

2508
01:54:24.906 --> 01:54:27.158
So we were able to use that.

2509
01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:29.494
Windham always loved
little Easter eggs.

2510
01:54:29.536 --> 01:54:31.955
When we did the original
lantern. if you look.

2511
01:54:31.996 --> 01:54:33.331
the eyes just look
like stitches.

2512
01:54:33.373 --> 01:54:35.166
but they're actually
Roman numerals

2513
01:54:35.208 --> 01:54:37.502
of Knash. his son's. birthday.

2514
01:54:37.544 --> 01:54:40.547
So we just kept
that tradition going.

2515
01:54:40.588 --> 01:54:42.632
The pinstripe.
Windham got the idea

2516
01:54:42.674 --> 01:54:45.760
to do each one
of his children's names.

2517
01:54:45.802 --> 01:54:48.179
He loved making you look
at something twice to find

2518
01:54:48.221 --> 01:54:50.557
something else more about it.

2519
01:54:50.598 --> 01:54:53.601
The stitches we did in a way
to where they're actually

2520
01:54:53.643 --> 01:54:55.729
the Roman numerals
of what would have been

2521
01:54:55.770 --> 01:54:58.606
his wedding anniversary.
which is December 6th.

2522
01:54:58.648 --> 01:55:00.233
12 on this side.

2523
01:55:00.275 --> 01:55:04.237
And then here. we have the six.

2524
01:55:04.279 --> 01:55:05.864
One of the ideas
that Windham had was.

2525
01:55:05.905 --> 01:55:08.241
instead of doing the spider
walk where he leans backwards.

2526
01:55:08.283 --> 01:55:10.035
if we did something where
he could lean forward.

2527
01:55:10.076 --> 01:55:11.911
His hair would
kind of fly up over.

2528
01:55:11.953 --> 01:55:13.413
So when he was crawling around.

2529
01:55:13.455 --> 01:55:14.873
he would expose
the second mask.

2530
01:55:14.914 --> 01:55:15.999
which would be hidden
by his hair.

2531
01:55:16.041 --> 01:55:17.709
Gross. disgusting face
on the front.

2532
01:55:17.751 --> 01:55:19.669
But then on the back.
we'd have this beautiful face.

2533
01:55:19.711 --> 01:55:22.213
And to Windham. the most
beautiful face was JoJo's.

2534
01:55:22.255 --> 01:55:24.007
So we 3D scanned JoJo's face.

2535
01:55:24.049 --> 01:55:27.594
And we were able to make a copy
of that and then sculpt it.

2536
01:55:27.635 --> 01:55:30.096
And we decided to put
these mockingbirds on there.

2537
01:55:30.138 --> 01:55:33.183
That's another homage to JoJo.

2538
01:55:33.224 --> 01:55:35.101
Windham's nickname
for JoJo was Mockingbird.

2539
01:55:35.143 --> 01:55:41.608

2540
01:55:41.649 --> 01:55:44.402
It's devastatingly
heartbreaking that

2541
01:55:44.444 --> 01:55:45.820
this is the last thing
I ever get to work on

2542
01:55:45.862 --> 01:55:47.280
with my best friend.

2543
01:55:47.322 --> 01:55:50.367
But I couldn't be more proud
of my crew and everyone

2544
01:55:50.408 --> 01:55:54.662
that came together that
helped us bring this to life.

2545
01:55:56.623 --> 01:55:59.209
I think it really
just hurts the most

2546
01:55:59.250 --> 01:56:01.670
that I never got to tell him
how much he meant to me.

2547
01:56:03.797 --> 01:56:05.423
It never felt work with him.

2548
01:56:05.465 --> 01:56:07.092
I just felt like I got to
hang out with my best friend.

2549
01:56:07.133 --> 01:56:09.803
and I miss that.

2550
01:56:09.844 --> 01:56:14.307
If I can give this to his fans
which meant the world to him.

2551
01:56:14.349 --> 01:56:16.768
then not all of him
is completely gone.

2552
01:56:16.810 --> 01:56:19.646
So if I get to help
my friend live on

2553
01:56:19.688 --> 01:56:23.650
in some way or capacity.
I'll be OK with that.

2554
01:56:23.692 --> 01:56:25.485
I can do that.

2555
01:56:27.278 --> 01:56:31.616
- He's not gone.
because the art he left

2556
01:56:31.658 --> 01:56:36.329
and his ideas will
live on forever.

2557
01:56:39.207 --> 01:56:41.376
- The real him was
much. much more

2558
01:56:41.418 --> 01:56:42.794
and much more entertaining

2559
01:56:42.836 --> 01:56:44.546
than any of his
characters could be.

2560
01:56:44.587 --> 01:56:49.676
He was very entertaining
always.

2561
01:56:49.718 --> 01:56:54.347
And he did that for them.
but you know. we got him.

2562
01:56:54.389 --> 01:56:56.891
And he's missed a lot.

01:57:45.231 --> 01:57:48.485
- I like to play sports.

2581
01:57:48.526 --> 01:57:50.570
I just like shoes. It's fun.

2582
01:57:50.612 --> 01:57:52.864
I just liked it 'cause like.
me and my dad did it together.

2583
01:57:52.906 --> 01:57:54.574
So yeah.

2584
01:57:54.616 --> 01:57:55.992
* *

2585
01:57:56.034 --> 01:57:59.913
- I want to travel everywhere
and become an artist.

2586
01:57:59.954 --> 01:58:02.248
* *

2587
01:58:02.290 --> 01:58:04.918
- He's definitely
in all four kids.

2588
01:58:04.959 --> 01:58:06.836
* *

2589
01:58:06.878 --> 01:58:09.214
They all four take after him
in some way.

2590
01:58:09.255 --> 01:58:11.007
* *

2591
01:58:11.049 --> 01:58:14.803
- Hyrie. I'd probably say
chaos.

2592
01:58:14.844 --> 01:58:20.558
Cadyn. probably smart.

2593
01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:23.269
Knash. he's just a dinosaur.

2594
01:58:23.311 --> 01:58:24.729
Just a dinosaur.

2595
01:58:24.771 --> 01:58:31.486
* *

2596
01:58:31.528 --> 01:58:35.573
- Knock on wood--if you
believe in afterlife.

2597
01:58:35.615 --> 01:58:38.201
you know.
we will get to see him again.

2598
01:58:41.371 --> 01:58:44.249
- My fire and love
for the business

2599
01:58:44.290 --> 01:58:46.543
has to burn brighter
than it ever has

2600
01:58:46.584 --> 01:58:50.547
because he's given me
the strength and passion

2601
01:58:50.588 --> 01:58:53.800
to want to carry his legacy on.

2602
01:58:53.842 --> 01:58:56.052
* *

2603
01:58:56.094 --> 01:58:58.346
If you asked him what he was.

2604
01:58:58.388 --> 01:59:00.974
he would say he's an artist.

2605
01:59:01.016 --> 01:59:03.393
* *

2606
01:59:03.435 --> 01:59:09.399
- * He's got the whole world *

2607
01:59:09.441 --> 01:59:14.487
* In his hands *

2608
01:59:14.529 --> 01:59:20.660
- The dad he was.
the son. the brother...

2609
01:59:20.702 --> 01:59:21.661
* *

2610
01:59:21.703 --> 01:59:24.330
Everything of who he was.

2611
01:59:24.372 --> 01:59:26.332
he was the best at it.

2612
01:59:26.374 --> 01:59:28.460
- I'm something
completely different

2613
01:59:28.501 --> 01:59:30.670
than has ever been in the WWE.

2614
01:59:30.712 --> 01:59:33.298
We're here.

2615
01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:37.427
- Windham once said.
wrestling is not a love story.

2616
01:59:37.469 --> 01:59:40.430
It's much more.

2617
01:59:40.472 --> 01:59:46.478
It's hope.
a spectacle no one can deny.

2618
01:59:46.519 --> 01:59:48.730
an excuse to be a kid again.

2619
01:59:48.772 --> 01:59:53.068
And nothing matters except
the moment we are in.

2620
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:58.323
- Walk by my side. and I will
lead you to paradise!

2621
01:59:58.365 --> 02:00:00.408
[dramatic music]

2622
02:00:00.450 --> 02:00:04.454
- And that is how
Windham Rotunda lived.

2623
02:00:04.496 --> 02:00:08.458
- I am the color red in a world
full of black and white.

2624
02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:10.543
- One of the most
unique minds.

2625
02:00:10.585 --> 02:00:13.672
Changed the landscape.

2626
02:00:13.713 --> 02:00:15.882
- He inspired
not only the fans.

2627
02:00:15.924 --> 02:00:17.717
but a lot of the boys
in the locker room

2628
02:00:17.759 --> 02:00:20.387
to push themselves
to be more creative.

2629
02:00:20.428 --> 02:00:22.097
- There's a love
for this industry.

2630
02:00:22.138 --> 02:00:25.892
And what he gave to it
was something special.

2631
02:00:25.934 --> 02:00:29.729
- Nobody ever has taken
the risks that he has.

2632
02:00:29.771 --> 02:00:32.232
- He opened up a world
that no one could ever do.

2633
02:00:32.273 --> 02:00:36.111
- I am forever.

2634
02:00:36.152 --> 02:00:38.863
- I think he is the template
for taking chances

2635
02:00:38.905 --> 02:00:41.449
and the template
for being brave.

2636
02:00:41.491 --> 02:00:44.077
- Do I have your attention now?

2637
02:00:44.119 --> 02:00:48.581
* *

2638
02:00:48.623 --> 02:00:55.380
- The greatest human I have
ever known. hands down.

2639
02:00:55.422 --> 02:00:57.090
- One of a kind.

2640
02:00:57.132 --> 02:00:59.217
There will only be one Windham.

2641
02:00:59.259 --> 02:01:04.389
- * He's got the whole world *

2642
02:01:04.431 --> 02:01:07.350
* *

2643
02:01:13.481 --> 02:01:14.816
- OK. Stand by.

2644
02:01:14.858 --> 02:01:16.026
Ready to roll.

2645
02:01:16.067 --> 02:01:19.029
[funky music]

2646
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:25.994
* *

2647
02:01:27.954 --> 02:01:29.789
- I've been very honored
to be asked

2648
02:01:29.831 --> 02:01:31.708
to be part of this project.

2649
02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:33.543
It's kind of bizarre to know

2650
02:01:33.585 --> 02:01:35.754
that I worked with Mike.

2651
02:01:35.795 --> 02:01:37.547
And then I remember meeting

2652
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:40.383
both boys
when they were small kids.

2653
02:01:40.425 --> 02:01:44.095
And then actually working
at WrestleMania with Windham.

2654
02:01:44.137 --> 02:01:47.098
You talk about things
coming full circle.

2655
02:01:47.140 --> 02:01:50.268
I could always see in Windham
that he was so different.

2656
02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:53.646
And you have very few people
that come along

2657
02:01:53.688 --> 02:01:56.066
that actually think
outside of the box.

2658
02:01:56.107 --> 02:01:59.402
He was obviously taken
from us way too soon.

2659
02:01:59.444 --> 02:02:00.737
I know what
he would have been.

2660
02:02:00.779 --> 02:02:03.656
and it would have been
really. really special.

2661
02:02:03.698 --> 02:02:08.036
- * Broken-hearted love *

2662
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:14.876
[static]

2663
02:02:14.918 --> 02:02:15.877
[beeping]

2664
02:02:18.338 --> 02:02:19.506
[eerie music]

2665
02:02:19.547 --> 02:02:26.054
* *

2666
02:02:31.059 --> 02:02:32.894
- Run.
