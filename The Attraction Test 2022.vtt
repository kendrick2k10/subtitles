00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:38.473
-Morning. Doctor Carver!

4
00:00:55.098 --> 00:00:56.360
-Hey Doctor Carver!

5
00:00:56.534 --> 00:00:57.535
-Ethan. hi.

6
00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:58.971
-Did you hear our big news?

7
00:00:59.146 --> 00:00:59.885
-No.

8
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.930
-We're engaged.

9
00:01:01.104 --> 00:01:01.974
-You and Clair?

10
00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.498
Oh. wow! Congratulations.

11
00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:06.501
-Well. it's all thanks to you.
Doctor Carver.

12
00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:08.503
If we hadn't participated
in your study.

13
00:01:08.676 --> 00:01:10.113
I probably would have never
discovered Clair was the one.

14
00:01:10.287 --> 00:01:12.942
-I'm so happy for you.
When's the big day?

15
00:01:13.116 --> 00:01:14.551
-We haven't set a date yet.
but when we do.

16
00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:15.945
we hope you can make it.

17
00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.294
-I would be honored.

18
00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:19.253
I'm sorry. I have to run.

19
00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:22.256
I have media training. but
you and Claire are the stars.

20
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.039
You're the first couple
in the study to get engaged.

21
00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:25.259
Oh!

22
00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:27.130
Anyway. congratulations again

23
00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:28.871
and let me know when
you pick a date.

24
00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:29.872
-Will do.

25
00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:31.091
-Ok. bye.
-Bye.

26
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.098
-Ok Brooke. it's all
very simple.

27
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:39.969
So. I will just pretend to be
a TV reporter

28
00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:41.449
and ask you some questions.

29
00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:42.624
Does that sound ok. Brooke?

30
00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:44.887
-Great. Fire away. Vince.

31
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:48.369
-Alright. So. Dr. Carver.
your new study is called
The Dating Test.

32
00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:50.021
How does it work?

33
00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:51.589
-Simply put. the dating test
helps you find

34
00:01:51.763 --> 00:01:53.461
your ideal person.

35
00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:55.506
The one.

36
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.553
Couples go on a series of dates
wearing these watch-like devices

37
00:01:58.727 --> 00:02:01.338
that record your heart rate.
dopamine levels.

38
00:02:01.512 --> 00:02:03.906
pulse ox and several
other indicators.

39
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.951
It's called the attraction
tracker.

40
00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.039
-But how do you know that
they're your ideal match?

41
00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:09.651
Like. the one.

42
00:02:09.824 --> 00:02:12.001
-Your level of attraction
to another person

43
00:02:12.175 --> 00:02:14.612
is measured on a scale
of 0 to 100.

44
00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:18.486
Meet someone who scores 95
and above. you've met the one.

45
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.314
-But is that all that love is?

46
00:02:20.488 --> 00:02:23.621
Just a series of chemical
reactions on a score sheet?

47
00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:26.972
-Yes. These physical signals
are far more reliable

48
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:28.626
than things like emotions.

49
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.280
-What about feelings?

50
00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:33.022
-Feelings are like relatives
at Christmas.

51
00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:34.937
They come and go.

52
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:37.505
-But isn't that how people have
found love for. well. forever?

53
00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:39.159
-Which explains why more
than half of marriages

54
00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:41.944
end in divorce.

55
00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:43.337
-How sad.

56
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:47.167
-Oh. sorry. Where was I?

57
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:50.430
So. Doctor Carver. has
this new study been tested?

58
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:52.084
How do you know that it works?

59
00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.086
-So far it's only been tested
on students.

60
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:57.002
but. just this morning a student
of mine told me

61
00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.918
he is engaged to the person
he took the study with.

62
00:03:00.092 --> 00:03:01.964
They both scored above 95.

63
00:03:02.138 --> 00:03:03.835
-Wow!

64
00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:05.576
So. Doctor Carver. you've
developed quite the reputation

65
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.317
for your studies on love.

66
00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:10.102
Is the dating test
your crowning achievement?

67
00:03:10.277 --> 00:03:11.974
-Oh. no. This is just
the beginning.

68
00:03:12.148 --> 00:03:15.325
There is so little research
on the science of love.

69
00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:16.892
So much to learn.

70
00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:18.328
-Well. thank you Doctor Carver.

71
00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:20.417
Is there anything
you'd like to add?

72
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:22.941
-No.
-You sure?

73
00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:27.468
-Oh. and here at Pemberton
University.

74
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:30.035
we conduct research
with heart.

75
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.559
Terrific. Brooke.
How did it feel?

76
00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:33.865
-Great. But. I'll have to check
the tape.

77
00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:37.347
Can't trust feelings. right?

78
00:03:37.521 --> 00:03:38.566
-Now I know what
you're thinking.

79
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.916
Where's the romance?

80
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.483
Measuring neurotransmitters

81
00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:45.180
isn't exactly the stuff
of Jane Austen.

82
00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:47.314
Is that what you're really
looking for?

83
00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:50.969
Drama. heartache. corsets.

84
00:03:51.143 --> 00:03:54.930
Why rely on some abstract.
gut feeling about someone

85
00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:57.062
when you can have
quantifiable results

86
00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:00.849
that tell you if that person
is the one for you.

87
00:04:01.023 --> 00:04:03.460
The dating test takes
the guessing work out of..

88
00:04:05.027 --> 00:04:07.029
-Rebecca. hi.
-Hi. Brooke.

89
00:04:07.203 --> 00:04:08.291
Practicing for tonight?

90
00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:09.901
-Yes. but it's fine.
Come in.

91
00:04:10.075 --> 00:04:11.599
-How's the speech coming?
-Great. I think.

92
00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:13.383
I'll just be giving a preview
of the study.

93
00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:15.342
-Well. you don't want to be
giving away too much.

94
00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:18.387
Want to save it for the big
study's release in two weeks.

95
00:04:18.562 --> 00:04:19.911
-Vince is billing it
as a teaser.

96
00:04:20.084 --> 00:04:21.043
-Ah. perfect.

97
00:04:21.216 --> 00:04:22.784
He told me that

98
00:04:22.957 --> 00:04:23.567
the practice interview
this morning went well.

99
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:24.960
-Mm-hm.

100
00:04:25.134 --> 00:04:27.005
-Never thought one
of my professors

101
00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:29.965
would get more TV time than
the university's president.

102
00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.923
Rebecca. I am not...

103
00:04:32.097 --> 00:04:33.969
-Oh. Brooke. I'm not
complaining.

104
00:04:34.143 --> 00:04:36.972
Your research has put
this school on the map.

105
00:04:37.146 --> 00:04:41.193
We plan on taking full advantage
of our newfound notoriety.

106
00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:43.021
Have you heard the new
branding slogan?

107
00:04:43.195 --> 00:04:44.501
-Research with heart.

108
00:04:44.675 --> 00:04:46.373
-Kind of humanizes it.
don't you think?

109
00:04:46.547 --> 00:04:47.983
Mm-hm.

110
00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:49.985
I mean. it's not just about
the data. right?

111
00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.030
-Uh.
-Oh. Brooke.

112
00:04:52.204 --> 00:04:54.642
We are gonna ride
your coattails.

113
00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:58.515
We intend to increase
enrollment. funding.

114
00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.039
maybe even bump up our ranking.

115
00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:03.825
-Oh. I don't know if my study
can do all that.

116
00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:08.046
-Brooke. don't be modest.
my star professor.

117
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.135
Or should I say Dean?

118
00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:12.964
-Dean?

119
00:05:13.138 --> 00:05:15.271
-Had a meeting with the Board.

120
00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:20.972
We think you'd be a perfect
new Dean of Psychology.

121
00:05:21.146 --> 00:05:24.062
But. let's revisit it
after the launch.

122
00:05:24.236 --> 00:05:25.934
-Yes. Of course.

123
00:05:26.108 --> 00:05:28.110
-And good luck tonight.
I'll see you at the theater.

124
00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:29.285
-Thanks. Rebecca.

125
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:32.288
-Oh. and no pressure. right?

126
00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:43.038
-She's expecting a boost in
donations. enrollment. ranking.

127
00:05:43.212 --> 00:05:43.952
-All from your study?

128
00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:45.780
-I know.

129
00:05:45.954 --> 00:05:47.303
-Hm. Doctor Frankenstein.
you've created a monster.

130
00:05:47.477 --> 00:05:48.913
-But wait. there's more.

131
00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:51.655
She's thinking of naming me
department Dean.

132
00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:55.355
-Huh. That'd be kind of weird.
having you as my boss.

133
00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.879
Wait. will you give me tenure?

134
00:05:58.053 --> 00:06:00.142
-Stop. I'm happy where I am.

135
00:06:00.316 --> 00:06:01.796
-Come on. psychology Dean?

136
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.059
More coin. prestige.
swanky receptions

137
00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:05.713
with that smelly cheese.

138
00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:08.890
-And less time for research.
my first love.

139
00:06:09.064 --> 00:06:13.024
-Speaking of first love. how's
it been since your last love?

140
00:06:13.198 --> 00:06:14.286
-You mean Logan?

141
00:06:14.461 --> 00:06:15.331
-I thought it was Landon.

142
00:06:15.505 --> 00:06:16.898
-Landon was before Logan.

143
00:06:17.072 --> 00:06:18.465
-Which makes your next
boyfriend Lucas?

144
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:20.162
-Which makes my next boyfriend
no one.

145
00:06:20.336 --> 00:06:21.685
I'm done.

146
00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:23.426
-With guys whose names
start with L?

147
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.819
-With guys period.
With dating. swiping right.

148
00:06:24.993 --> 00:06:26.647
-Oh. don't be a drama queen.

149
00:06:26.821 --> 00:06:28.997
-Carly. I am not having
my heart stomped on again.

150
00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:30.912
-But you're the expert on love.

151
00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:33.436
-Yes. with the science of love.
why the heart races.

152
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.830
the pupils dilate.
The palms sweat.

153
00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:37.440
-I thought that was
a panic attack?

154
00:06:37.614 --> 00:06:39.050
-It's why I developed
the love test.

155
00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:41.966
I want people looking for love
to find it.

156
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.707
-Ok. but what if you meet
a guy

157
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:46.884
who scores like a 98 on
the attraction tracker?

158
00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:49.104
-George Clooney's looks
with Einstein's smarts?

159
00:06:49.278 --> 00:06:53.413
Unlikely. Anyway. I don't need
men to get my dopamine fix.

160
00:06:53.587 --> 00:06:54.892
I have chocolate for that.

161
00:06:55.066 --> 00:06:56.416
-Oh. no. Thanks.

162
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.027
I hope to get my dopamine
boost tonight.

163
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:00.332
I have a date. And...

164
00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:01.986
-You're doing the test with him?

165
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.858
-Not the whole thing.
just some questions

166
00:07:04.032 --> 00:07:06.121
to see if he. you know.
measures up.

167
00:07:06.295 --> 00:07:07.775
-Good luck.

168
00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:09.167
-But. if the chocolate offer
still stands?

169
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:10.560
You know. for later.

170
00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:12.562
In case my date's
a dopamine dud.

171
00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:22.398
-Hey. Molly. Are you
in pain today?

172
00:07:22.572 --> 00:07:27.838
How's that leg doing. huh?
Still a little tender. huh?

173
00:07:28.012 --> 00:07:29.405
Aw.

174
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:31.059
-How's Molly doing.
Doctor Bennett?

175
00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:33.322
-Good. Yeah. she'll be ready
for walks soon.

176
00:07:33.496 --> 00:07:34.889
-When will she be ready
for adoption?

177
00:07:35.063 --> 00:07:36.978
-Oh. I'd say a week.
maybe two.

178
00:07:37.152 --> 00:07:40.284
-Oh. look at that face.
She'll be adopted in no time.

179
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.287
And to think when I started
we only had five dogs.

180
00:07:43.767 --> 00:07:45.987
-Oh. I'm sorry. Max.
Six dogs.

181
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:48.685
-Max. you don't count.
you're not up for adoption.

182
00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:52.341
You mind taking her back
to the kennels.

183
00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:53.951
make sure she's comfortable?

184
00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:55.518
-Sure. Doctor Bennett. yeah.
anything else?

185
00:07:55.692 --> 00:07:57.999
-Yeah. your advice.
-My advice?

186
00:07:58.173 --> 00:08:01.829
-Yeah. I'm going to a talk at
the university with Taylor later

187
00:08:02.003 --> 00:08:04.919
and uh. things have been
a little rocky lately.

188
00:08:05.093 --> 00:08:07.399
-Flowers. Every woman
loves flowers.

189
00:08:07.574 --> 00:08:08.836
-Old school. I like that.

190
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.360
-Maybe sunflowers?
Bright. cheerful.

191
00:08:11.534 --> 00:08:12.970
They bring good luck.

192
00:08:13.144 --> 00:08:15.582
-In that case. maybe
I'll get a couple dozen.

193
00:08:15.756 --> 00:08:17.279
-Good girl.

194
00:08:52.444 --> 00:08:53.445
Ugh!

195
00:08:57.667 --> 00:09:01.410
-Oh yeah. Perfect.

196
00:09:10.288 --> 00:09:11.333
-Beautiful.

197
00:09:11.507 --> 00:09:13.074
-Thanks. Way to a woman's heart.

198
00:09:13.248 --> 00:09:14.336
-And her brain.

199
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.033
-Sorry?

200
00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:18.035
-Oh. it's just. when a person
receives flowers.

201
00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:19.384
it's actually their brain
that produces

202
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.169
the pleasurable feelings.

203
00:09:21.343 --> 00:09:23.084
-Hm. That takes the romance
out of it.

204
00:09:23.258 --> 00:09:25.521
-Oh. romantic feelings
don't really...

205
00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:29.046
Sorry. don't mean to get
all science channel on you.

206
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.353
-Kind of a buzz kill.

207
00:09:31.527 --> 00:09:34.312
-My favorite customer.
How're you doing?

208
00:09:34.486 --> 00:09:37.402
-Happy as a sunflower
on a sunny day.

209
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:40.101
-Speaking of which?
-Oh. your flowers.

210
00:09:40.275 --> 00:09:43.191
Oh. this nice young man
is holding them for you.

211
00:09:43.365 --> 00:09:45.106
-Oh. uh. actually.

212
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.848
-There you go. Brooke.
all paid for.

213
00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:49.327
-Oh. thank you. Liz.

214
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:50.807
-Mm-hm. You got
the final bouquet.

215
00:09:51.373 --> 00:09:52.896
I saved the best for last.

216
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.464
-Ah. you are the best!
They're so beautiful.

217
00:09:55.638 --> 00:09:58.989
-That they are. Well. see you
next month. Brooke.

218
00:09:59.163 --> 00:09:59.903
-Bye.

219
00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:01.731
-Yeah. Bye.

220
00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:04.908
-Ah. hey. oh. excuse me.
Hey. um. those are my flowers.

221
00:10:05.082 --> 00:10:06.954
-Oh. I'm sorry. but they're
actually mine.

222
00:10:07.128 --> 00:10:09.086
-You saw me. I was
holding them.

223
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.480
-I know. but they're
still mine.

224
00:10:11.654 --> 00:10:13.961
-Do they have your name
on them or something?

225
00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:16.354
-Actually. I do
a standing order.

226
00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:19.270
-Ah. Oh.

227
00:10:19.444 --> 00:10:22.578
-Uh. what about lavender?
Makes a great aromatherapy.

228
00:10:22.752 --> 00:10:23.579
Very calming.

229
00:10:23.753 --> 00:10:24.928
-Hm. You don't say.

230
00:10:25.102 --> 00:10:26.234
-Cures insomnia.

231
00:10:26.408 --> 00:10:27.452
-Oh. I sleep like a baby.

232
00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:28.889
-Hair loss?
-I'm good.

233
00:10:29.063 --> 00:10:30.107
-Stress?

234
00:10:30.281 --> 00:10:31.282
-Getting worse by the moment.

235
00:10:31.456 --> 00:10:32.936
-Look. I'm sorry. I just...

236
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.459
-What if we go halfsies?

237
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.417
-Halfsies?

238
00:10:35.591 --> 00:10:37.158
-Split em 50-50.

239
00:10:37.332 --> 00:10:39.682
-Um. if not lavender.
then what about...

240
00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:43.686
-You don't understand. I
need all the luck I can get.

241
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.080
-You're right. I
don't understand.

242
00:10:46.254 --> 00:10:47.995
Anyway. good luck.

243
00:10:48.169 --> 00:10:51.389
-60-40? 70-30?

244
00:10:51.563 --> 00:10:53.087
Final offer.

245
00:11:13.107 --> 00:11:14.978
-Flower thief.
we meet again.

246
00:11:15.152 --> 00:11:17.024
-Ryan. Hi.

247
00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:18.590
-Taylor. hey.

248
00:11:18.765 --> 00:11:19.983
-Are Sophie and Kyle here?

249
00:11:20.157 --> 00:11:21.245
-Not yet.

250
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:23.857
-What's this?

251
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:25.119
-Lavender. It promotes healing.

252
00:11:25.293 --> 00:11:27.077
-It may just promote sleepiness.

253
00:11:27.251 --> 00:11:28.600
Hey. you want to see something
really beautiful?

254
00:11:28.775 --> 00:11:30.037
-Oh. it also cures hair loss.

255
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:32.039
-My new clothing line's out.

256
00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:34.084
This is the collection
I was talking about.

257
00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:37.871
where elegant. modern
and comfort blend into one.

258
00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:40.351
-Huh. Nice.

259
00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:42.005
-Nice?

260
00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:43.920
Ryan. these are $1500 outfits.

261
00:11:44.094 --> 00:11:47.141
-People actually
pay that?

262
00:11:47.315 --> 00:11:50.013
-Yes. People with money.

263
00:11:50.187 --> 00:11:51.972
Something you had when you
worked with Kyle.

264
00:11:52.146 --> 00:11:53.538
-Taylor. let's. let's...

265
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.977
-Hey! Sorry we're late.
Nice flowers.

266
00:11:57.151 --> 00:11:58.108
-Don't get me started.

267
00:11:58.282 --> 00:11:59.588
-I am so excited for this.

268
00:11:59.762 --> 00:12:00.371
-Me too.

269
00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:01.938
-Me three.

270
00:12:02.112 --> 00:12:04.158
-Yeah me. who. who is
this woman again?

271
00:12:04.332 --> 00:12:05.550
-I told you Ryan.
it's a professor

272
00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.074
who does all these
studies on love.

273
00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:09.076
-She developed this
wearable biosensor

274
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.860
and it monitors your body's
attraction to another person.

275
00:12:11.034 --> 00:12:12.427
-What?

276
00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:13.471
-It gives you like
an attraction score.

277
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:14.429
I think she calls it a...

278
00:12:14.603 --> 00:12:16.431
-Attraction tracker.

279
00:12:16.605 --> 00:12:17.475
After three dates. you know
if you met your perfect match.

280
00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:18.999
-Isn't that incredible?

281
00:12:19.173 --> 00:12:20.740
-Incredible and totally
ridiculous.

282
00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:21.697
-Well. apparently her study's
being published

283
00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:23.177
in a psychology journal.

284
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:24.918
-More likely "Ladies
Home Journal".

285
00:12:25.092 --> 00:12:26.354
-Is everything a joke
to you Ryan?

286
00:12:26.528 --> 00:12:29.009
-No. it's just. it's not
how it works.

287
00:12:29.183 --> 00:12:30.575
Love is a feeling.

288
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.360
It's like a giant fireball
hitting you.

289
00:12:32.534 --> 00:12:34.275
-A fireball?
-Yeah.

290
00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:36.233
-Like love at first sight?
-Exactly.

291
00:12:36.407 --> 00:12:38.366
It just. you know. doesn't
happen on the first date.

292
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.977
forget about it.

293
00:12:41.151 --> 00:12:44.198
-Ready to go in?
-Yeah. I'm right behind you.

294
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:48.071
-Forget about it.
-After you.

295
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.815
-Flowers?

296
00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:57.820
-This is all your fault.
This is all your fault!

297
00:13:04.044 --> 00:13:05.523
-Ready?

298
00:13:05.697 --> 00:13:07.308
-Ready as I'll ever be.

299
00:13:07.482 --> 00:13:10.093
-FYI. we're recording this.

300
00:13:10.267 --> 00:13:12.487
We'll use clips for
the study's release.

301
00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:16.665
Great. Good luck...
Dean Carver.

302
00:13:19.537 --> 00:13:21.452
-Dean Carver.

303
00:13:22.627 --> 00:13:24.586
It does kind of have
a ring to it.

304
00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:29.112
And so the big question
everyone wants to know.

305
00:13:29.286 --> 00:13:33.247
can the dating test really
help you find the one.

306
00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:36.076
Can these physical indicators
really tell you

307
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.601
if someone is your
one true love?

308
00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:44.432
All in less than a week?
And the answer is... yes.

309
00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:45.868
It works.

310
00:13:47.783 --> 00:13:51.091
Eight out of ten people
who scored 95 or above

311
00:13:51.265 --> 00:13:54.659
were identified as their
partner's ideal match.

312
00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:58.011
So. now I have a question
for you.

313
00:13:58.185 --> 00:13:59.926
What are you waiting for?

314
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.277
Why wait for the mythical
arrow to strike

315
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:09.457
when you can do something
to find the love of your life.

316
00:14:18.248 --> 00:14:20.555
Two weeks from today I will be
back on this stage

317
00:14:20.729 --> 00:14:23.471
to announce the
official release.

318
00:14:23.645 --> 00:14:26.430
I'd be happy to take
a few questions.

319
00:14:26.604 --> 00:14:27.997
Yes. you.

320
00:14:30.173 --> 00:14:32.349
Oh. It's the man from
the flower shop.

321
00:14:32.523 --> 00:14:34.047
-How're my sunflowers doing?

322
00:14:34.221 --> 00:14:36.310
-My sunflowers are alive
and well. thank you.

323
00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:38.268
Do you have a question?

324
00:14:38.442 --> 00:14:41.489
-Yeah. I was wondering if you've
taken this dating test yourself?

325
00:14:41.663 --> 00:14:43.056
-Researchers don't
usually participate

326
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.318
in their own studies.

327
00:14:44.492 --> 00:14:45.362
-So the answer is no?

328
00:14:45.536 --> 00:14:47.321
-Ryan. stop.

329
00:14:47.495 --> 00:14:49.671
-Well. yes. I mean no. I never
participated in the study.

330
00:14:49.845 --> 00:14:51.978
-Well. with all due respect.
Doctor.

331
00:14:52.152 --> 00:14:53.327
you're telling others
to try something

332
00:14:53.501 --> 00:14:54.894
you're not willing
to try yourself.

333
00:14:55.068 --> 00:14:57.287
-Ryan. Sit down.
-What?

334
00:14:57.461 --> 00:14:59.899
-People can decide
for themselves.

335
00:15:00.073 --> 00:15:01.857
-Vince. tell her to move
onto somebody else.

336
00:15:02.031 --> 00:15:03.815
-Brooke. Rebecca wants you
to take another question.

337
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.165
-Another question.

338
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:08.995
-Hey.

339
00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:16.828
-Taylor. Taylor. wait!

340
00:15:17.003 --> 00:15:18.743
-That was so embarrassing.

341
00:15:18.918 --> 00:15:20.310
You're never interested in
anything that I care about.

342
00:15:20.484 --> 00:15:22.051
Ever since you left
your practice with Kyle.

343
00:15:22.225 --> 00:15:23.313
all you care about is
your dog rescue center.

344
00:15:23.487 --> 00:15:25.054
-I care about you.

345
00:15:25.228 --> 00:15:26.926
-Face it. Ryan. it's...
it's not working out.

346
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.538
-Taylor. come on.
What. Taylor?

347
00:15:30.712 --> 00:15:31.408
Please!

348
00:15:31.582 --> 00:15:33.193
What...

349
00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:39.547
-Thank you.

350
00:15:42.202 --> 00:15:43.507
-Sorry about that. Brooke.

351
00:15:43.681 --> 00:15:44.595
I didn't like where
it was going.

352
00:15:44.769 --> 00:15:46.467
-I can handle that guy.

353
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:49.078
-I know. I just wanted it over.
We can edit the video.

354
00:15:49.252 --> 00:15:52.386
Fantastic presentation.
Congratulations.

355
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.865
-Thank you.

356
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.215
-Maybe we'll skip
the Q & A next time.

357
00:15:57.826 --> 00:15:59.175
-Do you have a question?

358
00:15:59.349 --> 00:16:00.872
-Yeah. I was wondering
if you have taken

359
00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:02.962
the dating test yourself?

360
00:16:03.136 --> 00:16:04.050
-Researchers don't usually
participate

361
00:16:04.224 --> 00:16:05.399
in their own studies.

362
00:16:05.573 --> 00:16:06.878
-So the answer is no?

363
00:16:07.053 --> 00:16:08.576
-Well. yes. I mean no.

364
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.926
I never participated
in the study.

365
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.710
-With all due respect-

366
00:16:12.884 --> 00:16:13.973
-Don't worry. we're deleting
all that from the video.

367
00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:15.670
-That bad?

368
00:16:15.844 --> 00:16:17.411
-We just can't afford
any hiccups right now.

369
00:16:17.585 --> 00:16:19.065
There's too much riding
on the study's release.

370
00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:21.589
-Sorry to interrupt.
but we have an issue.

371
00:16:21.763 --> 00:16:22.938
-Researchers don't
usually participate

372
00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:24.070
in their own studies.

373
00:16:24.244 --> 00:16:26.028
-So the answer is no?

374
00:16:26.202 --> 00:16:28.378
-Well. yes. I mean no. I never
participated in the study.

375
00:16:28.552 --> 00:16:29.379
-Hm. well...

376
00:16:29.553 --> 00:16:30.990
-Vince. we all saw that.

377
00:16:31.164 --> 00:16:34.863
-Yeah. and so have
529.006 other people.

378
00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:36.908
I'm afraid someone recorded it
on their phone.

379
00:16:37.083 --> 00:16:38.432
-Oh no.

380
00:16:38.606 --> 00:16:39.999
-It's getting a thousand hits
a minute.

381
00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:41.609
Almost half a million likes.

382
00:16:41.783 --> 00:16:44.438
They're referring to Brooke
as Doctor Cupid.

383
00:16:44.612 --> 00:16:47.832
-The study's credibility.
Brooke's reputation.

384
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.008
The school's reputation.

385
00:16:49.182 --> 00:16:50.487
-The new branding campaign.

386
00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:53.273
-Fundraising. Enrollment.
Our ranking.

387
00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:54.361
-This is a disaster.

388
00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:55.623
-It is.

389
00:16:57.277 --> 00:16:58.800
Unless. uh...

390
00:17:00.454 --> 00:17:02.456
-Yes. of course.
I'll take the study.

391
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.066
-That's it.

392
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.067
-I'll find a single professor
on campus.

393
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:06.763
we'll finish in a week

394
00:17:06.938 --> 00:17:08.243
and still have a week to prepare
for the launch.

395
00:17:08.417 --> 00:17:10.116
-But what about if you find.
you know?

396
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.074
-What. find my perfect match?

397
00:17:12.248 --> 00:17:14.468
-Vince. have you seen
the eligible bachelors

398
00:17:14.642 --> 00:17:15.859
on this campus?

399
00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:19.125
-Alright. They're not all bad.

400
00:17:19.299 --> 00:17:20.952
-Problem solved.

401
00:17:21.127 --> 00:17:22.127
-Perfect!

402
00:17:26.741 --> 00:17:27.959
-Eventually we'll bump out
this back wall

403
00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:29.874
and make room for more kennels.

404
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.312
-I gotta hand it to you. buddy.
this place looks amazing.

405
00:17:32.486 --> 00:17:35.489
-Yeah. thanks.
Oh. check this out.

406
00:17:35.663 --> 00:17:37.099
-What's this?

407
00:17:37.273 --> 00:17:39.841
-This is a plan for the space
next door.

408
00:17:40.015 --> 00:17:41.712
Wow! You've thought
about everything.

409
00:17:41.886 --> 00:17:43.932
A little artificial grass.
room for the dogs to run around.

410
00:17:44.106 --> 00:17:45.368
-I love it.

411
00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:46.804
I guess this means
you're definitely

412
00:17:46.978 --> 00:17:47.849
not coming back
to the practice

413
00:17:48.023 --> 00:17:49.416
-No chance.

414
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.591
-Another stake through
Taylor's heart.

415
00:17:50.765 --> 00:17:52.419
-Tell me about it.

416
00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:53.376
-You heard from her?

417
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.551
-Nope.

418
00:17:54.725 --> 00:17:56.510
No. no. she's pretty upset.

419
00:17:56.684 --> 00:18:00.035
She says that I'm not interested
in things that interest her.

420
00:18:00.209 --> 00:18:00.992
-Like the dating test.

421
00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:02.516
-That's one.

422
00:18:05.736 --> 00:18:07.129
You're not gonna
believe this.

423
00:18:07.303 --> 00:18:09.566
Some PR guy from that university
called me.

424
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.396
he said he wants me to take the
dating test with that professor.

425
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.919
-No kidding. What did you say?

426
00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:16.747
-I said no. of course.

427
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:18.880
I mean he hadn't even run it by
the professor yet.

428
00:18:19.054 --> 00:18:20.186
-Well. what if she agreed
to do it?

429
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.275
-I would still say no.

430
00:18:22.449 --> 00:18:24.277
Although he did offer me
a stipend.

431
00:18:24.451 --> 00:18:26.017
-Really? How much?

432
00:18:26.192 --> 00:18:27.149
-A lot.

433
00:18:27.323 --> 00:18:29.195
-I think you should do it.

434
00:18:29.369 --> 00:18:30.805
-It's like a week.

435
00:18:30.979 --> 00:18:32.285
It's. that's a week
I'll never get back.

436
00:18:32.459 --> 00:18:34.591
-But maybe you'd get
Taylor back.

437
00:18:34.765 --> 00:18:36.985
-Well. how- what are you
talking about?

438
00:18:37.159 --> 00:18:40.380
-Look. Taylor wants you
to take this test thing
seriously. right?

439
00:18:40.554 --> 00:18:42.991
-Yeah.
-Ok. so. stay with me here.

440
00:18:43.165 --> 00:18:45.036
You take the dating test
with the professor

441
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:48.257
to convince Taylor that
you're taking it seriously.

442
00:18:48.431 --> 00:18:51.869
and then I get a cut
of your stipend.

443
00:18:52.043 --> 00:18:54.568
-Huh. I mean. it would pay
for a lot of artificial grass.

444
00:18:54.742 --> 00:18:56.222
-That too.

445
00:18:57.179 --> 00:18:59.007
-Alright. let's do it.
-Yes.

446
00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:01.227
-How do we tell Taylor?
-Ah.

447
00:19:01.401 --> 00:19:03.098
Oh. you can bet.
if I tell Sophie...

448
00:19:03.272 --> 00:19:04.404
-Oh yeah. she's gonna
tell Taylor.

449
00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:07.407
-Exactly. What about
a plan B?

450
00:19:07.581 --> 00:19:09.235
-For what? How to tell Taylor?

451
00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:11.411
-No. what if the dating
test works

452
00:19:11.585 --> 00:19:13.413
and you fall madly in love
with her?

453
00:19:13.587 --> 00:19:16.067
-Ah. I would have felt something
on the first time that we met.

454
00:19:16.242 --> 00:19:17.068
-No giant fireball?

455
00:19:17.243 --> 00:19:18.679
-Not even a flicker.

456
00:19:18.853 --> 00:19:19.767
-Then we've got nothing
to worry about.

457
00:19:19.941 --> 00:19:21.160
-Ok.

458
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:26.121
-Let me see if I understand
correctly.

459
00:19:26.295 --> 00:19:28.993
You want me to date you
for a week?

460
00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.561
-That's right. Doctor Matthews.
We'll finish in a week.

461
00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:33.520
-Ok.

462
00:19:33.694 --> 00:19:35.304
-Oh. great. great. any chance
you can start tomorrow?

463
00:19:35.478 --> 00:19:37.437
-I need to check
with my wife.

464
00:19:37.611 --> 00:19:39.134
-You need to ask your wife.

465
00:19:39.308 --> 00:19:41.484
Yeah. Um. never mind.
I thought...

466
00:19:41.658 --> 00:19:42.920
-Hey honey. there's a professor
on the phone.

467
00:19:43.094 --> 00:19:45.096
-Okay. bye.

468
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:47.838
-Good news. The search is over.

469
00:19:48.012 --> 00:19:50.841
Vince has found you the perfect
man to take the test with.

470
00:19:51.015 --> 00:19:51.973
-He's a doctor.

471
00:19:52.147 --> 00:19:53.888
-Really?

472
00:19:54.062 --> 00:19:55.194
'Cause I think I've asked almost
every professor on campus.

473
00:19:55.368 --> 00:19:57.326
-Hello again.

474
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.504
-Uh. Brooke. meet
Doctor Ryan Bennett.

475
00:20:01.678 --> 00:20:04.115
-You're joking.

476
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.856
-Doctor Bennett has...

477
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.858
-Ryan. please.

478
00:20:08.032 --> 00:20:12.211
-Uh. Ryan has graciously agreed
to take the test with you.

479
00:20:12.385 --> 00:20:13.908
-You're not joking.

480
00:20:14.082 --> 00:20:15.126
-Brooke. we think this is
exactly what's needed

481
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:16.867
to get ahead of the viral video.

482
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:20.523
-But him?
-Yes. me.

483
00:20:20.697 --> 00:20:22.525
The guy from the flower shop.

484
00:20:22.699 --> 00:20:24.397
-Oh. sorry. I thought
you were the guy

485
00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:26.137
who was asking snarky questions.

486
00:20:26.312 --> 00:20:27.313
-Snarky?

487
00:20:27.487 --> 00:20:29.010
-Would you prefer rude?

488
00:20:29.184 --> 00:20:30.577
-I prefer informed.

489
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:32.318
-Are you even a real doctor?

490
00:20:32.492 --> 00:20:33.971
-Look who's asking snarky
questions now.

491
00:20:34.145 --> 00:20:36.887
-I prefer informed.

492
00:20:37.061 --> 00:20:39.890
-If the dating test can get
these two to fall in love.

493
00:20:40.064 --> 00:20:42.023
it can get anyone
to fall in love.

494
00:20:42.197 --> 00:20:44.765
-So. are you gonna ask me
my astrological sign?

495
00:20:48.072 --> 00:20:50.466
-Oh. he's cute.

496
00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.164
-Who. that guy or the dog?

497
00:20:53.339 --> 00:20:54.775
-Oh. come on. Brooke.

498
00:20:54.949 --> 00:20:57.256
A cute guy who runs
Jolly Rovers Rescue?

499
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.214
He can't be all bad.

500
00:20:59.388 --> 00:21:00.694
-No?

501
00:21:00.868 --> 00:21:03.044
I can grin and bear it
for a week.

502
00:21:03.218 --> 00:21:04.524
-And your first date's
this evening?

503
00:21:04.698 --> 00:21:06.090
-"Date."

504
00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:09.964
-Wow. who's that?

505
00:21:10.138 --> 00:21:11.487
-He didn't say he had
a girlfriend.

506
00:21:11.661 --> 00:21:13.968
Probably who the flowers
are for.

507
00:21:14.142 --> 00:21:15.535
Doesn't matter.
It's all for show.

508
00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:17.058
-Brooke. you saw him
in the flower shop

509
00:21:17.232 --> 00:21:19.582
just before your speech.
It's fate.

510
00:21:19.756 --> 00:21:21.671
-More like a fluke.

511
00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:25.240
Anyway. a week from now I can
say I did the test and move on.

512
00:21:25.414 --> 00:21:27.982
-Unless he turns out to be
your perfect match.

513
00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:31.028
-That guy? More like the dog.

514
00:21:33.422 --> 00:21:38.949
Ok. Born and raised
in Muncie. Indiana.

515
00:21:39.123 --> 00:21:41.561
-University of Chicago.
Columbia.

516
00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:45.913
PhD in social psychology.

517
00:21:46.087 --> 00:21:48.568
Pioneering in studies
on the science of love.

518
00:21:48.742 --> 00:21:50.700
More like pseudoscience.

519
00:21:52.746 --> 00:21:54.182
Hm.

520
00:21:54.356 --> 00:21:56.184
Wish my college professors
looked like that.

521
00:22:01.145 --> 00:22:03.191
-What do we have in here?

522
00:22:04.235 --> 00:22:05.933
-Ok. it's ready.

523
00:22:06.107 --> 00:22:10.285
-Neurological studies of
interpersonal closeness.

524
00:22:10.459 --> 00:22:11.895
-My dissertation.

525
00:22:12.069 --> 00:22:13.549
-Oh. romantic.

526
00:22:13.723 --> 00:22:15.899
-So. I did a spreadsheet to...

527
00:22:16.073 --> 00:22:19.033
-Wait. wait. wait.
We have spreadsheets?

528
00:22:19.207 --> 00:22:22.863
-Yes. to plot out the times.
places and objectives

529
00:22:23.037 --> 00:22:24.908
of our dates this week.

530
00:22:25.082 --> 00:22:26.736
-Our dates have objectives?

531
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.303
-Yes. didn't you read the
background info I sent you?

532
00:22:28.477 --> 00:22:31.001
-Uh. yep.
Yeah. I skimmed.

533
00:22:31.175 --> 00:22:32.612
-Which is why I brought
you this.

534
00:22:32.786 --> 00:22:34.353
-Wow. Well. I hope this is
a take home test.

535
00:22:34.527 --> 00:22:36.485
-It includes the complete study.
a list of questions.

536
00:22:36.659 --> 00:22:38.574
types of dates and appendices.

537
00:22:38.748 --> 00:22:40.184
You'll need this.

538
00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.490
-Oh. Doctor Carver.
you shouldn't have.

539
00:22:41.664 --> 00:22:43.927
I didn't get you anything.

540
00:22:44.101 --> 00:22:46.974
-The biosensor monitors
your heart rate. pulse ox.

541
00:22:47.148 --> 00:22:48.454
and a bunch of other things.

542
00:22:48.628 --> 00:22:50.151
-Hm. And who monitors
the monitor?

543
00:22:50.325 --> 00:22:52.501
-Me. I'll record the scores
after each date.

544
00:22:52.675 --> 00:22:55.896
-Wow. if I knew you were keeping
score I would have shaved.

545
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.333
-We go on three different
types of dates

546
00:22:58.507 --> 00:23:01.815
to compare our compatibility
in different settings.

547
00:23:01.989 --> 00:23:03.033
-Hm.

548
00:23:03.207 --> 00:23:05.035
-What? It's in your folder.

549
00:23:05.209 --> 00:23:06.602
-I'm sure.

550
00:23:06.776 --> 00:23:08.604
-After tonight's introductory
date.

551
00:23:08.778 --> 00:23:12.913
we go on a stress-inducing date
followed by a romantic date.

552
00:23:13.087 --> 00:23:15.306
We'll finish in a week.
Do you want to go first?

553
00:23:15.481 --> 00:23:18.309
-Uh. for what?

554
00:23:18.484 --> 00:23:20.964
-The list of questions.
It's in your folder.

555
00:23:21.138 --> 00:23:22.966
-Hm. Well I...
You know what.

556
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.403
I thought we'd just get
to know each other

557
00:23:24.577 --> 00:23:26.405
a little bit before we...

558
00:23:26.579 --> 00:23:28.450

00:23:38.721 --> 00:23:42.029
you have a very attractive
girlfriend.

564
00:23:42.203 --> 00:23:44.335
-Impressive.
-Thanks.

565
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.990

00:24:06.401 --> 00:24:08.882
-Now. the list of questions.

574
00:24:09.056 --> 00:24:10.274
-Where's your folder?

575
00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:12.712
-On here.
-Well. of course it is.

576
00:24:14.017 --> 00:24:15.410
Ah. Ok.

577
00:24:21.198 --> 00:24:23.418
-Ah. hmm.
-Thank you.

578
00:24:25.812 --> 00:24:27.944
Alright. Name three things
you and your partner

579
00:24:28.118 --> 00:24:29.642
appear to have in common.

580
00:24:29.816 --> 00:24:32.253
-Uh. we're both human.
-I think that's cheating.

581
00:24:32.427 --> 00:24:34.995
-Ok. Uh. we both live
in the same city.

582
00:24:35.169 --> 00:24:36.344
-One.

583
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:37.998
-We're both doctors.
-Two.

584
00:24:38.172 --> 00:24:39.086
-We both...

585
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.045
-Let's see. We both...

586
00:24:42.219 --> 00:24:43.569
-We both are stumped
on the third thing

587
00:24:43.743 --> 00:24:44.483
that we have in common.

588
00:24:44.657 --> 00:24:46.310
-Good enough. Ok.

589
00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:48.356
Name something you consider
to be a positive trait

590
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.140
in your partner.

591
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.276
-Next.
-Next.

592
00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:56.799
-Mm.

593
00:24:57.278 --> 00:24:58.888
-Oh. I got one here.

594
00:24:59.062 --> 00:25:01.064
When did you last sing
to yourself?

595
00:25:01.238 --> 00:25:02.283
-Never.

596
00:25:02.457 --> 00:25:02.979
-You never sing to yourself?

597
00:25:03.153 --> 00:25:04.546
-Never.

598
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.156
-So what. you've never
done karaoke?

599
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:10.117
-Once. which also answers
question 16.

600
00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:12.902
-Share an embarrassing moment
in your life.

601
00:25:13.076 --> 00:25:17.167
Hm. Well. I sing to myself
from time to time.

602
00:25:17.341 --> 00:25:18.995
around the house.

603
00:25:25.306 --> 00:25:27.917
Yeah. Why don't you sing
to yourself?

604
00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:28.744
-That's why.

605
00:25:28.918 --> 00:25:31.007
-Ho. ho. ho. ok.

606
00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:33.314
For the jugular
on the first date.

607
00:25:33.488 --> 00:25:36.883
-Ok. why don't we just do this
or that questions.

608
00:25:37.057 --> 00:25:38.232
-Sure.

609
00:25:38.406 --> 00:25:41.931
-Cat or dog?
That's a gimme.

610
00:25:42.105 --> 00:25:43.150
TV or book?

611
00:25:43.324 --> 00:25:45.848
-Book.

612
00:25:46.022 --> 00:25:48.634
-Cake or pie?
-Cake.

613
00:25:51.637 --> 00:25:53.160
I'm on a roll here.

614
00:25:56.816 --> 00:26:00.167
-Ok. Passenger or driver?

615
00:26:00.341 --> 00:26:02.343
-Passenger. You get
to see more things.

616
00:26:02.517 --> 00:26:06.347
-Driver you're more in control.
Winter or summer?

617
00:26:06.521 --> 00:26:07.130
Winter.

618
00:26:07.304 --> 00:26:08.218
-Summer.

619
00:26:08.392 --> 00:26:09.393
-Baseball or football?

620
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:10.917
-Football.

621
00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:12.483
-I don't do sports.
Lions or bears?

622
00:26:12.658 --> 00:26:13.528
Lions.

623
00:26:13.702 --> 00:26:15.399
-Bears. by six points.

624
00:26:17.532 --> 00:26:19.752
Oh. you really don't do sports.

625
00:26:22.189 --> 00:26:24.060
Oh. excuse me.

626
00:26:26.019 --> 00:26:27.890
Oh. no. I have an emergency.

627
00:26:28.064 --> 00:26:30.893
Uh. a dog has an
obstructed airway.

628
00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:32.025
-Oh. you have to go?

629
00:26:32.199 --> 00:26:33.635
-Afraid so.

630
00:26:33.809 --> 00:26:35.594
-Well. I understand.
Maybe we can reschedule?

631
00:26:35.768 --> 00:26:38.422
-Maybe not. You can come
with me.

632
00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:39.467
-To the dog rescue?

633
00:26:39.641 --> 00:26:40.990
-Dog adoption center.

634
00:26:41.164 --> 00:26:42.513
Yeah. this is a quick procedure

635
00:26:42.688 --> 00:26:43.906
and then we can
pick up afterwards.

636
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.560
-Okay.

637
00:26:45.734 --> 00:26:47.040
-Hate to see you revise
your spreadsheets.

638
00:26:57.224 --> 00:26:58.312
-How long has he been
breathing like this?

639
00:26:58.486 --> 00:27:00.053
-Since he came in.

640
00:27:00.227 --> 00:27:07.103
-Okay. Alright. buddy.
Let me see. Okay. Okay.

641
00:27:07.277 --> 00:27:10.280
Yeah. yeah. it's obstructing
his airway.

642
00:27:10.454 --> 00:27:11.891
It's really far in though.

643
00:27:12.065 --> 00:27:13.414
-Should I sedate him
for an extraction?

644
00:27:13.588 --> 00:27:15.329
-No. I don't think
there's time.

645
00:27:15.503 --> 00:27:18.506
Um. I have an idea. it's not
conventional but it works.

646
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.377
-Ok.

647
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:21.030
-Uh. Brooke. you might
want to back up a little bit.

648
00:27:21.204 --> 00:27:22.336
-Oh. ok.

649
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:26.122
-Ok. buddy.
Yeah. You ready?

650
00:27:26.296 --> 00:27:34.087
Three. two. one.
There you go. buddy.

651
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:35.175
Good job.

652
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.962
-Ok. Good job.

653
00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:42.965
-Oh boy.

654
00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:51.017
-So. why a vet?
Why not a people doctor?

655
00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:53.541
-Other than cheaper
malpractice premiums?

656
00:27:53.715 --> 00:27:54.716
I don't know.

657
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.632
It's just. always loved animals.

658
00:27:57.806 --> 00:28:01.854
-A vet that runs a dog
adoption business.

659
00:28:02.028 --> 00:28:04.117
-Right. Before that I was
in a private practice

660
00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:06.336
with a business partner.

661
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.947
-Why'd you give it up?

662
00:28:08.121 --> 00:28:10.384
-Well. I still practice
veterinary care.

663
00:28:10.558 --> 00:28:12.168
but running a dog
adoption center

664
00:28:12.342 --> 00:28:15.258
had always been
a life-long dream.

665
00:28:15.432 --> 00:28:17.086
-Nice.

666
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.872
Being a scientist was always
my life-long dream.

667
00:28:20.046 --> 00:28:20.829
-What do you know?

668
00:28:21.003 --> 00:28:22.483
-What?

669
00:28:22.657 --> 00:28:24.311
-That's the third thing
we have in common.

670
00:28:24.485 --> 00:28:25.965
Both in our dream jobs.

671
00:28:26.139 --> 00:28:27.140
-Hm.

672
00:28:29.533 --> 00:28:32.058
-It's my stop.
-Mm-hm.

673
00:28:32.232 --> 00:28:33.973
-So. about tomorrow's date.
-Hm?

674
00:28:34.147 --> 00:28:37.237
Choose an activity that induces
high levels of stress.

675
00:28:37.411 --> 00:28:39.979
-Oh. oh. oh. oh.
I know mine.

676
00:28:40.153 --> 00:28:41.850
-I know mine.
I'll text you.

677
00:28:42.024 --> 00:28:44.157
-I'll text you back.

678
00:28:44.331 --> 00:28:47.334
-So. one down...
-Two to go.

679
00:28:47.508 --> 00:28:49.118
-Was that the weirdest
date ever?

680
00:28:49.292 --> 00:28:51.512
-Absolutely. Who plans their
dates with spreadsheets?

681
00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:56.560
-I meant the choking dog.
-Yeah. that too.

682
00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:06.483
-Well. Goodnight. Doctor Carver.
-Goodnight. Doctor Bennett.

683
00:29:12.185 --> 00:29:14.535
-So? How was your date?

684
00:29:14.709 --> 00:29:18.278
-It went fine. Until a dog
spit rawhide at me.

685
00:29:18.452 --> 00:29:19.932
-What? In the restaurant?

686
00:29:20.106 --> 00:29:21.847
-No. I went with him
on an emergency call.

687
00:29:22.021 --> 00:29:23.370
He gave the Heimlich
to a dog

688
00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:25.851
choking on one of
those rawhide things.

689
00:29:26.025 --> 00:29:28.070
It was pretty funny actually.

690
00:29:28.244 --> 00:29:29.898
-I don't know. Brooke.

691
00:29:30.072 --> 00:29:31.160
Sounds to me like you did
more than grin and bear it.

692
00:29:31.334 --> 00:29:35.034
-Oh. stop. Carly.
Warrior two.

693
00:29:37.036 --> 00:29:38.559
-What was his score?

694
00:29:38.733 --> 00:29:40.866
-Actually. I think I need
to recalibrate the...

695
00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:41.954
-Brooke.

696
00:29:42.128 --> 00:29:43.346
-88

697
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.348
-Wow. Impressive
for a first date.

698
00:29:45.522 --> 00:29:46.959
-Sometimes multi-variant
data can...

699
00:29:47.133 --> 00:29:49.048
-And your score?

700
00:29:49.222 --> 00:29:51.006
-89.

701
00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.443
-You two are approaching
ideal match territory.

702
00:29:53.617 --> 00:29:56.142
-It's probably just an anomaly.

703
00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:58.274
-Not for someone who
has "in data we trust"
tattooed on her...

704
00:29:58.448 --> 00:30:01.190
-Stop. How was your date?

705
00:30:01.364 --> 00:30:03.062
-Ugh. disaster.

706
00:30:03.236 --> 00:30:04.977
Never made it past
the second question.

707
00:30:05.151 --> 00:30:06.326
-What? Name the last book
you read?

708
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.980
-He said "War and Peace".

709
00:30:08.154 --> 00:30:10.156
I mean. no one actually reads
"War and Peace".

710
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.287
-He might have.

711
00:30:11.461 --> 00:30:12.375
-Have you read it?

712
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:14.073
-I started it.

713
00:30:14.247 --> 00:30:17.424
-Exactly. He was just trying
to impress me.

714
00:30:17.598 --> 00:30:20.644
-Ok. well you should actually
do all of the questions.

715
00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:22.081
-I'm taking the speed
dating route.

716
00:30:22.255 --> 00:30:24.039
Only asking three questions.

717
00:30:24.213 --> 00:30:26.520
Name a cheesy song you love. who
would be your ideal dinner guest

718
00:30:26.694 --> 00:30:30.045
and what's the most beautiful
view you've ever seen.

719
00:30:30.219 --> 00:30:31.438
-And that's your plan to finding
the perfect match?

720
00:30:31.612 --> 00:30:33.483
-Yes.

721
00:30:33.657 --> 00:30:36.443
I want a guy who reads poetry
and loves sappy love songs.

722
00:30:36.617 --> 00:30:37.923
Who wants to have dinner
with Plato.

723
00:30:38.097 --> 00:30:39.446
Not J Lo.

724
00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.058
-What about Vince?
-What about Vince?

725
00:30:43.232 --> 00:30:44.973
-You don't notice the way
he looks at you

726
00:30:45.147 --> 00:30:47.628
with that shy boyish smile?

727
00:30:47.802 --> 00:30:50.979
-Brooke. he looks at everyone
with that shy. boyish smile.

728
00:30:51.153 --> 00:30:53.025
-Mm-hm. If you say so.

729
00:30:53.199 --> 00:30:56.115
-So. what's your
big date tonight?

730
00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:58.334
-The stress-inducing date.

731
00:31:00.249 --> 00:31:02.208
Downward dog.

732
00:31:05.646 --> 00:31:07.126
That's your downward dog?

733
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.737
-No. this is my tired dog.

734
00:31:24.012 --> 00:31:25.361
-I can't do this.

735
00:31:25.535 --> 00:31:27.973
-You haven't bowled yet.
-I know. but...

736
00:31:28.147 --> 00:31:32.412
-Brooke. It's just a game.
-Oh. no. This game is evil.

737
00:31:32.586 --> 00:31:36.024
Its sole purpose is to torment.
ridicule and degrade.

738
00:31:36.198 --> 00:31:39.071
Leaving people without
a scrap of dignity.

739
00:31:39.245 --> 00:31:40.550
-Bowling?

740
00:31:40.724 --> 00:31:42.117
-Everyone watching you

741
00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:44.903
while you're making a fool
of yourself.

742
00:31:45.077 --> 00:31:47.296
-I mean. that's the fun of it.

743
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.691
-Do I look like I'm having fun?

744
00:31:50.865 --> 00:31:55.043
-Uh. ok. Um. I won't look.

745
00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.613
-Very chivalrous of you.

746
00:32:01.354 --> 00:32:03.008
Ok. don't look.

747
00:32:03.182 --> 00:32:05.314
-I'm not. I'm not looking.
I won't.

748
00:32:22.201 --> 00:32:24.116
That didn't sound great.

749
00:32:26.118 --> 00:32:27.249
-It looked even worse.

750
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.556
-Can I look now?
-No.

751
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.340
Let me go again.

752
00:32:37.477 --> 00:32:40.219
-That sounded better.

753
00:32:40.393 --> 00:32:43.744
-You really are a terrible liar.
Just go.

754
00:32:45.746 --> 00:32:47.095
Hey. that wasn't easy.

755
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:49.010
I should get bonus points
or something.

756
00:32:49.184 --> 00:32:52.187
-I mean. it's not surprising
when you are bowling with these.

757
00:32:52.361 --> 00:32:54.450
It's really not that hard.
Can I just show you one thing?

758
00:32:54.624 --> 00:32:56.104
-Sure.
-Ok.

759
00:33:03.503 --> 00:33:07.898
-Alright. Now. you want
to swing your arm back.

760
00:33:08.073 --> 00:33:12.860
keep your wrist straight
and as you swing forward.

761
00:33:13.034 --> 00:33:14.427
release the ball.

762
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:15.384
But remember. keep
your wrist straight.

763
00:33:15.558 --> 00:33:17.952
-Ok.
-Alright.

764
00:33:18.126 --> 00:33:19.649
-I think I have it.
-Ok. Great.

765
00:33:22.522 --> 00:33:25.307
-Ok. wrist straight.

766
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:37.928
-Yes!

767
00:33:45.371 --> 00:33:47.286
-See. it's all in the wrist.

768
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:51.246
-Yeah. thanks.
Your turn.

769
00:33:54.467 --> 00:33:55.468
-Alright.

770
00:34:10.135 --> 00:34:11.571
-Yeah!!
-Oh!

771
00:34:12.398 --> 00:34:15.009
It's all in the wrist.

772
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:19.056
-Thank you.

773
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.887
-Well. I survived.

774
00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:25.411
-Well. more than survived.

775
00:34:25.585 --> 00:34:28.239
you bowled a perfectly
respectable 63.

776
00:34:28.414 --> 00:34:31.069
So. what if someone scored a
63 on your attraction tracker?

777
00:34:31.243 --> 00:34:33.375
-Only a 63?
Probably not a keeper.

778
00:34:33.549 --> 00:34:37.118
but that's why we go on three
dates. I take the average.

779
00:34:37.292 --> 00:34:40.860
-Hm. curious. what was my score
after the first date?

780
00:34:41.034 --> 00:34:43.516
-I only reveal the scores
at the end.

781
00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.040
-No exceptions?

782
00:34:46.214 --> 00:34:47.955
-You were above 63.

783
00:34:48.129 --> 00:34:51.219
-Oh yes. I'm perfectly
respectable.

784
00:34:51.393 --> 00:34:53.569
So. what is it with you
and bowling?

785
00:34:53.743 --> 00:34:57.573
-Childhood trauma.
-Left a scar?

786
00:34:57.747 --> 00:35:01.316
-On me and almost on several
eight-year-old boys.

787
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.231
-Wow. There's a story there.

788
00:35:03.405 --> 00:35:06.452
-My brother's eighth birthday.
I was 10.

789
00:35:06.626 --> 00:35:08.367
We had a bowling party.

790
00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:11.587
I was warming up. you know.
getting the old arm limber

791
00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:15.025
and holding onto my ball and
swinging my ball back and forth

792
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.333
and back and forth and...
it slipped.

793
00:35:18.507 --> 00:35:20.118
-This can't end well.

794
00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:22.424
-Ball flew out of my hand.
took out the birthday boy

795
00:35:22.598 --> 00:35:24.383
and three of his friends
and the party clown.

796
00:35:24.557 --> 00:35:26.211
-That clown probably
had it coming.

797
00:35:26.385 --> 00:35:29.127
-No one got hurt but the ball
didn't stop rolling

798
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:32.217
until it smashed
into the snack bar.

799
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:34.001
I can still see the look
on that little boy's face

800
00:35:34.175 --> 00:35:35.872
as he saw it coming
towards him.

801
00:35:36.046 --> 00:35:37.570
His loaded nachos
went everywhere.

802
00:35:37.744 --> 00:35:39.920
-That's traumatic.
-Expensive too.

803
00:35:40.094 --> 00:35:41.443
I mean. insurance only covers
so much.

804
00:35:41.617 --> 00:35:43.445
-Right.

805
00:35:43.619 --> 00:35:45.578
-So. what makes your half of
tonight's dates so stressful?

806
00:35:45.752 --> 00:35:47.145
-Well. you'll see.

807
00:35:47.319 --> 00:35:48.972
Did we get through
all those questions?

808
00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:53.063
-Uh. there's still a few more.
Oh. here's a good one.

809
00:35:53.238 --> 00:35:55.327
Describe a perfect day
you've had.

810
00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:56.545
-Uh.

811
00:35:56.719 --> 00:35:57.894
-I know mine.

812
00:35:58.068 --> 00:35:59.418
-Go for it.

813
00:35:59.592 --> 00:36:01.420
-Well. it's mostly perfect

814
00:36:01.594 --> 00:36:04.597
because it started off
so imperfectly.

815
00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:06.381
When I was a little girl.

816
00:36:06.555 --> 00:36:11.299
I was at my cousin's wedding
and I lost Screech.

817
00:36:11.473 --> 00:36:12.822
-Screech?

818
00:36:12.996 --> 00:36:14.781
-My stuffed snowy owl.
I was devastated.

819
00:36:14.955 --> 00:36:16.130
Inconsolable.

820
00:36:16.304 --> 00:36:18.828
Well. I was the flower girl

821
00:36:19.002 --> 00:36:21.091
and I was supposed to carry
white lilies.

822
00:36:21.266 --> 00:36:22.267
-Nice.

823
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:24.486
-But. when I got to the church.

824
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:29.535
the bride handed me this huge
bouquet of sunflowers.

825
00:36:29.709 --> 00:36:31.841
-I hear you're fond of those.

826
00:36:32.015 --> 00:36:34.931
-She said they would brighten
even the darkest day.

827
00:36:35.105 --> 00:36:36.629
And they did.

828
00:36:36.803 --> 00:36:38.892
It was the most beautiful thing
I had ever seen.

829
00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:40.285
-More beautiful
than a snowy owl?

830
00:36:40.459 --> 00:36:43.026
-Definitely. But not as cuddly.

831
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:45.159
Still. it cheered me up

832
00:36:45.333 --> 00:36:47.074
and even today whenever
I need a pick me up...

833
00:36:47.248 --> 00:36:49.468
-You buy sunflowers
standing order.

834
00:36:49.642 --> 00:36:51.383
-They're just happy flowers.

835
00:36:51.557 --> 00:36:53.036
-Sounds pretty perfect.

836
00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:54.951
-So. what about you?

837
00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:57.040
-That's gonna have to wait
because it is time

838
00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:58.912
for my stress-inducing date.

839
00:36:59.086 --> 00:37:01.001
-More stressful than bowling?

840
00:37:01.175 --> 00:37:02.437
-Yes.

841
00:37:02.611 --> 00:37:06.528
And for you.
definitely more painful.

842
00:37:23.023 --> 00:37:24.894
-I warned you.
-You're not that bad.

843
00:37:25.068 --> 00:37:26.853
-You're a worse liar than me.

844
00:37:34.556 --> 00:37:37.864
Oh. sorry. sorry.
We should- this was a bad idea.

845
00:37:38.038 --> 00:37:41.215
-It's no worse than bowling.
And that ended ok.

846
00:37:41.389 --> 00:37:43.870
-True. except bowling was
only stressful for one of us.

847
00:37:44.044 --> 00:37:46.220
-Well. this isn't stressful
for me. Painful maybe.

848
00:37:58.667 --> 00:38:01.061
-I feel like I'm back
in high school.

849
00:38:01.235 --> 00:38:02.541
-You went to your
high school dances?

850
00:38:02.715 --> 00:38:06.284
-A few. What. you didn't?

851
00:38:06.458 --> 00:38:08.068
-A few.

852
00:38:09.199 --> 00:38:10.375
-Oh.

853
00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:15.858
Let me guess. you were the shy
girl at the back of the gym?

854
00:38:16.032 --> 00:38:17.730
-Yeah.

855
00:38:17.904 --> 00:38:20.385
-Big thick glasses.
before you got your contacts.

856
00:38:20.559 --> 00:38:22.212
-Yep.

857
00:38:22.387 --> 00:38:24.998
-Hoping that that weird.
annoying kid in science class

858
00:38:25.172 --> 00:38:26.956
didn't ask you to dance?

859
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:29.829
-Ken Friss.

860
00:38:30.003 --> 00:38:32.266
That kid was a wizard
with a petri dish.

861
00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.920
-He has an annoying name.

862
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:40.579
-I bet you were the guy all
the girls wanted to dance with.

863
00:38:40.753 --> 00:38:42.102
-Uh. no.

864
00:38:42.276 --> 00:38:44.060
No. I was more like
your buddy Ken.

865
00:38:44.234 --> 00:38:48.021
Just trying to work up the
courage to ask that shy girl

866
00:38:48.195 --> 00:38:51.633
with big thick glasses to dance.

867
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.115
I'm always going for the strong
silent type.

868
00:39:01.077 --> 00:39:02.818
-Woah! Sorry.

869
00:39:02.992 --> 00:39:03.950
-I think we should just stop.

870
00:39:04.124 --> 00:39:05.473
-Come on. you two.

871
00:39:05.647 --> 00:39:06.822
I could drive a truck
through there.

872
00:39:06.996 --> 00:39:08.781
Get closer.

873
00:39:08.955 --> 00:39:10.696
-Oh!
-Isn't that better?

874
00:39:13.002 --> 00:39:15.918
And a little bit less swaying.
You look like drunk sailors.

875
00:39:16.092 --> 00:39:18.878
Remember. it's one. two.
three and back.

876
00:39:19.052 --> 00:39:19.748
One. two. three.

877
00:39:19.922 --> 00:39:21.271
Try.

878
00:39:21.446 --> 00:39:23.012
One. two. three.

879
00:39:25.972 --> 00:39:30.019
-Oh. sorry. Sorry.

880
00:39:30.193 --> 00:39:35.547
-Ok. what if I try leading. if
that wouldn't wound your ego?

881
00:39:35.721 --> 00:39:39.812
-No. better than wounding you.
-Ok.

882
00:39:39.986 --> 00:39:42.467
-Should we take it from the top?
-Mm-hm.

883
00:39:47.297 --> 00:39:49.561
Oooh.

884
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:58.874
-Hey! I'm dancing
without maiming anybody.

885
00:40:31.559 --> 00:40:33.909
-So. other than proving
that you're as bad at bowling

886
00:40:34.083 --> 00:40:37.522
as I am at dancing. what was
the purpose of tonight?

887
00:40:37.696 --> 00:40:39.915
-Relationships aren't
all wine and roses.

888
00:40:40.089 --> 00:40:41.917
People need to see how they
react to each other

889
00:40:42.091 --> 00:40:43.441
during times of stress.

890
00:40:43.615 --> 00:40:45.399
-The biosensor tells you that?

891
00:40:45.573 --> 00:40:47.967
-It measures norepinephrine.
the stress hormone.

892
00:40:48.141 --> 00:40:49.751
-Hm.

893
00:40:49.925 --> 00:40:51.449
Can love really be explained
so scientifically?

894
00:40:51.623 --> 00:40:53.929
I mean. there's no room
for mystery and magic?

895
00:40:54.103 --> 00:40:55.104
-Only in fairy tales.

896
00:40:55.278 --> 00:40:56.584
-Well not for me.

897
00:40:56.758 --> 00:40:58.194
I'm a love at first sight
kind of guy.

898
00:40:58.368 --> 00:40:59.805
-You don't think you can grow
to love someone?

899
00:40:59.979 --> 00:41:01.546
-Not if you don't feel that
lightning bolt

900
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.417
the first time you meet.

901
00:41:03.591 --> 00:41:06.942
I mean. it is such
an amazing feeling.

902
00:41:07.116 --> 00:41:09.989
It's like your heart's about
to burst.

903
00:41:10.163 --> 00:41:13.949
-It's very romantic.
And. messy.

904
00:41:16.604 --> 00:41:18.606
-Ryan there's-
-But then-

905
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.870
-Sorry. You go.

906
00:41:22.044 --> 00:41:23.829
-I want to be clear with you.

907
00:41:24.003 --> 00:41:28.877
I'm only doing the test
with you to say I did the test.

908
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:30.705
-No. I figured.

909
00:41:30.879 --> 00:41:34.622
Yeah. I saw your video on
social media. Doctor Cupid.

910
00:41:34.796 --> 00:41:37.582
-Truthfully. I'm done
with dating.

911
00:41:37.756 --> 00:41:39.627
I mean. actual dating.

912
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:44.066
My history with men is a joke
and I'm always the punchline.

913
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.590
-Hm.

914
00:41:45.764 --> 00:41:47.635
-I'm not having my heart
broken again.

915
00:41:47.809 --> 00:41:49.289
-I thought you didn't believe
in broken hearts?

916
00:41:49.463 --> 00:41:51.987
-I don't. But it sounds better

917
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:54.642
than a precipitous drop
in oxytocin levels.

918
00:41:57.210 --> 00:41:58.951
-Well. I guess you should know
that I'm only doing this

919
00:41:59.125 --> 00:42:01.475
to win back my girlfriend.

920
00:42:01.649 --> 00:42:03.651
-How will this help you
win her back?

921
00:42:03.825 --> 00:42:07.829
-Well. Taylor and I came
and saw your talk that night

922
00:42:08.003 --> 00:42:10.136
and after she wanted
to take the test

923
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:12.921
and I kind of made fun of her.

924
00:42:13.095 --> 00:42:14.619
-I like her already.

925
00:42:14.793 --> 00:42:17.360
-Well. I guess I'm trying
to do this to show her

926
00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:19.014
that I'm taking it seriously.

927
00:42:19.188 --> 00:42:21.408
Taking her seriously.
you know. impress her.

928
00:42:21.582 --> 00:42:23.062
-So. let's impress her.

929
00:42:23.236 --> 00:42:26.239
Let's show her you wooing
the socks off of me

930
00:42:26.413 --> 00:42:27.849
and only the socks.

931
00:42:28.023 --> 00:42:29.721
-How?

932
00:42:29.895 --> 00:42:31.461
-The university wants me to do
a video tomorrow night

933
00:42:31.636 --> 00:42:33.115
and talk about how I'm doing
the study with you.

934
00:42:33.289 --> 00:42:34.943
You know. strange bed fellows
and all that.

935
00:42:35.117 --> 00:42:36.597
-Ok.

936
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:37.380
-They think it will diffuse
the viral video.

937
00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:38.904
-Hmm.

938
00:42:39.078 --> 00:42:40.949
-So. why don't you be
in the video too?

939
00:42:41.123 --> 00:42:43.125
We just have to make sure
Taylor's there.

940
00:42:43.299 --> 00:42:45.171
-Yeah. I can probably
arrange that.

941
00:42:45.345 --> 00:42:50.045
-And I'll act all. you know.
charmed by your witty repartee.

942
00:42:50.219 --> 00:42:51.569
-Well. maybe you could do like
a hair flick thing.

943
00:42:51.743 --> 00:42:53.222
-Oh. you mean like this?

944
00:42:53.396 --> 00:42:55.007
-Oh. very convincing.

945
00:42:56.661 --> 00:42:58.010
-Great. I'll text you
the details.

946
00:42:58.184 --> 00:42:59.533
-Great.

947
00:42:59.707 --> 00:43:01.143
And then tomorrow's
our last date?

948
00:43:01.317 --> 00:43:03.885
-The romantic date with gifts.
Then we're done.

949
00:43:04.059 --> 00:43:06.061
-Perfect.

950
00:43:06.235 --> 00:43:09.978
-Oh. can you do that hair flick
thing one more time?

951
00:43:10.152 --> 00:43:12.024
-Save it for tomorrow.

952
00:43:18.421 --> 00:43:21.903
-Wait. wait. wait.
What do you mean "spark"?

953
00:43:22.077 --> 00:43:23.601
-When we were dancing.

954
00:43:23.775 --> 00:43:26.168
-You mean like a bzzt spark.
or like a boom.

955
00:43:26.342 --> 00:43:27.387
love at first sight
kind of thing?

956
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:28.954
-Definitely not a kaboom.

957
00:43:29.128 --> 00:43:30.520
Was more like a flicker.
you know?

958
00:43:30.695 --> 00:43:32.435
It was like a warm tingle.

959
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.482
-Ok. that sounds serious.

960
00:43:35.656 --> 00:43:38.311
-It's actually just nothing
like I expected. you know?

961
00:43:38.485 --> 00:43:42.924
She's more flexible
and self-deprecating.

962
00:43:43.098 --> 00:43:44.012
She's funny.

963
00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:45.623
-Hold on. time out.

964
00:43:45.797 --> 00:43:47.102
Are you talking about
spreadsheet woman?

965
00:43:47.276 --> 00:43:48.930
-Yes. She's got a whole
other side.

966
00:43:49.104 --> 00:43:51.150
A fun side. you know?

967
00:43:51.324 --> 00:43:52.542
I mean. you should have seen
her bowling.

968
00:43:52.717 --> 00:43:54.544
She was great.
She was funny.

969
00:43:54.719 --> 00:43:57.243
She's just fun.

970
00:43:57.417 --> 00:43:58.984
What?

971
00:43:59.158 --> 00:44:01.943
-The look on your face.
like a lovesick puppy.

972
00:44:02.117 --> 00:44:03.902
-Yeah. well she also said
that she's only doing it

973
00:44:04.076 --> 00:44:05.860
so that she can say
that she did it.

974
00:44:06.034 --> 00:44:07.862
You know. it's a PR thing
for her.

975
00:44:08.036 --> 00:44:09.516
-Well that's fair. You're only
doing it to impress Taylor.

976
00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:10.648
-I told her that.

977
00:44:10.822 --> 00:44:12.301
-Really? What did she say?

978
00:44:12.475 --> 00:44:15.217
-She said that she wants
to help me woo Taylor.

979
00:44:15.391 --> 00:44:17.916
-Seriously? How?

980
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.353
-Ok. I need you to bring Taylor

981
00:44:20.527 --> 00:44:23.008
to the theater at Pemberton.
7:30PM.

982
00:44:23.182 --> 00:44:24.879
-Tonight? What for?

983
00:44:25.053 --> 00:44:27.882
-I'm gonna do a video with
Brooke. ok?

984
00:44:28.056 --> 00:44:29.710
Huh.

985
00:44:29.884 --> 00:44:30.668
The university thinks
it's gonna take some air out

986
00:44:30.842 --> 00:44:32.626
of this viral video

987
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.540
and I think it's gonna show
Taylor I'm taking her seriously.

988
00:44:33.714 --> 00:44:35.368
-Ah! I get it.

989
00:44:35.542 --> 00:44:38.066
-Now. but don't tell Taylor
that I'm in the video.

990
00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.634
-Surprising her? Ok.
What do you want me to say?

991
00:44:40.808 --> 00:44:43.245
-Anything. Just make sure
she's there at 7:30PM. ok?

992
00:44:43.419 --> 00:44:44.116
-Got it.

993
00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:45.465
-Thank you.

994
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:55.257
-Hey. Soph. listen.
I need a favor.

995
00:45:04.179 --> 00:45:06.138
-I understand we have
a special guest tonight?

996
00:45:06.312 --> 00:45:07.792
-Yes. I invited Ryan.

997
00:45:07.966 --> 00:45:09.837
-Pure genius. Brooke.

998
00:45:10.011 --> 00:45:12.231
And we'll link tonight's video
with the one that went viral.

999
00:45:12.405 --> 00:45:14.059
-People will see you're taking
the test with him and...

1000
00:45:14.233 --> 00:45:15.060
-Crisis averted.

1001
00:45:15.234 --> 00:45:16.801
-We'll do our best.

1002
00:45:16.975 --> 00:45:18.324
-And I'm sorry you're just
seeing this now. Brooke.

1003
00:45:18.498 --> 00:45:20.587
I had to revise it
when I heard about Ryan.

1004
00:45:20.761 --> 00:45:22.154
-A script?

1005
00:45:22.328 --> 00:45:23.895
Vince. I can't memorize
this in time.

1006
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:26.332
-Oh. no worries.
It'll be on prompters.

1007
00:45:26.506 --> 00:45:29.161
-We just want to play it safe.
No more surprises.

1008
00:45:29.335 --> 00:45:31.816
-Well. break a leg.

1009
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.904
-Oh. sorry. Vince.

1010
00:45:33.078 --> 00:45:34.993
-Oh. Carly. Hi.

1011
00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:39.301
-So. I'll be in the back.
You are going to crush this.

1012
00:45:39.475 --> 00:45:41.651
-Thanks Carly.

1013
00:45:42.435 --> 00:45:44.002
-Looks like you two are falling
in love.

1014
00:45:44.176 --> 00:45:47.005
-Oh. um. the scores
are surprising

1015
00:45:47.179 --> 00:45:49.964
but it's still the average
that counts.

1016
00:45:50.138 --> 00:45:52.010
-You remind me of myself
when I was your age.

1017
00:45:52.184 --> 00:45:55.927
A rising scientist thinking I
could save the world with data.

1018
00:45:56.101 --> 00:45:58.103
When it came to dating.
I had a checklist.

1019
00:45:58.277 --> 00:46:00.061
Wanted to meet
the perfect man.

1020
00:46:00.235 --> 00:46:03.195
Eventually. I met someone
who checked off all the boxes.

1021
00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:04.326
-Did you marry him?

1022
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.416
-Yes. and I was miserable.

1023
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.202
He had everything
I thought I wanted

1024
00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:12.421
but nothing I truly needed.

1025
00:46:12.595 --> 00:46:13.945
Affection.

1026
00:46:14.119 --> 00:46:15.860
Acceptance. Forgiveness.

1027
00:46:16.034 --> 00:46:17.035
And a heck
of a lot of fun.

1028
00:46:18.732 --> 00:46:20.255
-Oh. I'm sorry. Rebecca.

1029
00:46:20.429 --> 00:46:21.953
I always thought you were
happily married.

1030
00:46:22.127 --> 00:46:23.824
-Oh. happily remarried.

1031
00:46:23.998 --> 00:46:26.305
Oh. I ditched the checklist.

1032
00:46:26.479 --> 00:46:28.133
Followed my heart.

1033
00:46:28.307 --> 00:46:30.048
Good luck tonight.

1034
00:46:42.277 --> 00:46:43.670
-Kyle. why are we here again?

1035
00:46:43.844 --> 00:46:45.106
-I told you. Doctor Carver
invited you

1036
00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.891
to the recording
of her new video.

1037
00:46:47.065 --> 00:46:48.022
-But why me?

1038
00:46:48.196 --> 00:46:49.545
-Well. she...

1039
00:46:49.719 --> 00:46:50.895
-It's Doctor Carver's way
of apologizing

1040
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:51.852
for how Ryan acted
the other night.

1041
00:46:52.026 --> 00:46:53.071
-Exactly.

1042
00:46:53.245 --> 00:46:54.463
-I don't even know the woman.

1043
00:46:54.637 --> 00:46:57.031
-Well. she knows that you...

1044
00:46:57.205 --> 00:46:58.859
-She found you on Ryan's
social media.

1045
00:46:59.033 --> 00:47:00.774
-Exactly.

1046
00:47:00.948 --> 00:47:02.384
-And as a woman she knows
what it's like to be with a guy

1047
00:47:02.558 --> 00:47:03.908
who thinks he knows
absolutely everything.

1048
00:47:04.082 --> 00:47:05.213
-Exactly.

1049
00:47:05.387 --> 00:47:06.954
-Come on. we're gonna be late.

1050
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.091
-Hey there.
-Hey.

1051
00:47:13.265 --> 00:47:14.309
-She's here. Taylor.

1052
00:47:14.483 --> 00:47:16.877
-Great. I've been practicing.

1053
00:47:17.051 --> 00:47:18.487
-Perfect.

1054
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:19.967
-About the script.
I didn't know...

1055
00:47:20.141 --> 00:47:21.447
-Yeah. Vince gave it to me.

1056
00:47:21.621 --> 00:47:23.231
I thought we'd just wing it.
you know?

1057
00:47:23.405 --> 00:47:24.624
Let our natural charm flow.

1058
00:47:24.798 --> 00:47:26.060
-They don't want any surprises.

1059
00:47:26.234 --> 00:47:27.975
-The surprise is how
lame this is.

1060
00:47:28.149 --> 00:47:31.152
Come on. what happened
to our witty repartee?

1061
00:47:31.326 --> 00:47:32.980
-He means well.
I know though.

1062
00:47:33.154 --> 00:47:35.243
We should go.
Your tracker.

1063
00:47:35.417 --> 00:47:36.549
-Thank you.

1064
00:47:59.137 --> 00:48:02.488
-So. yes. It's official.
I am doing the test.

1065
00:48:02.662 --> 00:48:04.272
And while I've
never participated

1066
00:48:04.446 --> 00:48:08.102
in one of my own studies before.
I have to say it's been.

1067
00:48:08.276 --> 00:48:09.887
well. interesting.

1068
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:11.845
But what's really been
interesting is

1069
00:48:12.019 --> 00:48:14.500
who I'm doing the test with.

1070
00:48:14.674 --> 00:48:17.895
You may recognize
my study participant.

1071
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:20.158
Veterinarian from
Jolly Rovers Rescue.

1072
00:48:20.332 --> 00:48:22.595
Doctor Ryan Bennett.

1073
00:48:22.769 --> 00:48:24.118
-Hello. Doctor Carver.

1074
00:48:24.292 --> 00:48:25.903
-Hello Doctor Bennett.

1075
00:48:26.077 --> 00:48:29.994
-Yes. it has been interesting
"dating" you.

1076
00:48:30.168 --> 00:48:34.607
-Yes. indeed. You were a real
thorn in my side that night.

1077
00:48:34.781 --> 00:48:36.870
-And now every night
I'm at your side.

1078
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:40.526
-I wrote that.

1079
00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.223
-You certainly are.

1080
00:48:42.397 --> 00:48:44.225
We just have to survive
one more date. to...

1081
00:48:44.399 --> 00:48:46.358
-So. what's been your favorite
date so far?

1082
00:48:46.532 --> 00:48:47.402
-Oh. um...

1083
00:48:50.101 --> 00:48:51.363
Hm?

1084
00:48:51.754 --> 00:48:52.842
-How about the time
when we went bowling?

1085
00:48:53.017 --> 00:48:54.322
-Uh...

1086
00:48:54.496 --> 00:48:56.237
-Yeah. She's the only person
I know

1087
00:48:56.411 --> 00:48:58.848
who can turn bowling
into a contact sport.

1088
00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:01.068
-Good one.

1089
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:02.983
-Oh. what about
our dancing date?

1090
00:49:03.157 --> 00:49:05.290
Last time I wear
open-toe heels with him.

1091
00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:08.858
And don't ever agree to help him
treat a choking dog.

1092
00:49:09.033 --> 00:49:10.469
-I told you to stand back.

1093
00:49:10.643 --> 00:49:12.427
-He pushed on that dog's
stomach. and whoosh.

1094
00:49:12.601 --> 00:49:15.256
this slobbery thing shoots right
past my face and nearly hits me.

1095
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:17.171
-Well. that's a small price
to pay for saving a life.

1096
00:49:17.345 --> 00:49:18.825
-Oh. easy for him to say.

1097
00:49:18.999 --> 00:49:20.392
He wasn't covered in dog drool.

1098
00:49:20.566 --> 00:49:24.918
-Oh. well. We did have our
romantic moments.

1099
00:49:25.092 --> 00:49:27.399
-Oh. really?
Where was I?

1100
00:49:27.573 --> 00:49:28.966
-Out on the dance
floor when...

1101
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:31.881
I remember seeing stars
in your eyes.

1102
00:49:32.056 --> 00:49:33.840
-From you stepping on me.

1103
00:49:34.014 --> 00:49:35.885
-They're going off script.
Ad-libbing.

1104
00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.844
-I know. Isn't it great?

1105
00:49:38.018 --> 00:49:40.020
-Ok. well. I admit
that I felt something.

1106
00:49:40.194 --> 00:49:42.631
Yeah. I always used to laugh
at my friends

1107
00:49:42.805 --> 00:49:46.592
who would tell me about this
feeling. this warm glow they got

1108
00:49:46.766 --> 00:49:49.247
when they slowly get to know
somebody. but...

1109
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:50.291
It's true.

1110
00:49:50.465 --> 00:49:52.859
It's the best feeling.

1111
00:49:53.033 --> 00:49:58.952
It's like this heavy blanket
on a cold morning.

1112
00:49:59.126 --> 00:50:04.175
It's warm and safe and you just
don't want to be anywhere else.

1113
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:10.268
Just feels right and easy
and a little scary.

1114
00:50:13.793 --> 00:50:16.491
But not as scary
as her bowling.

1115
00:50:16.665 --> 00:50:18.537
-Or as painful
as his dancing.

1116
00:50:18.711 --> 00:50:19.755
-Mm.

1117
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:26.762
-Brooke...

1118
00:50:26.936 --> 00:50:27.981
Now. I'll admit. some of that
was actually quite funny

1119
00:50:28.155 --> 00:50:29.896
and at times even touching.

1120
00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:31.985
but I thought we agreed
to stick to the script?

1121
00:50:32.159 --> 00:50:34.988
-And I admire someone
who takes chances.

1122
00:50:35.162 --> 00:50:39.079
-Oh. well. um. well. it was
pretty funny. choking dog.

1123
00:50:42.691 --> 00:50:44.911
-I'm sorry. Rebecca.
I just got caught up and...

1124
00:50:45.085 --> 00:50:48.088
-No need for apologies.
Good on you for taking a risk.

1125
00:50:48.262 --> 00:50:51.526
It's a quality I'll be looking
for in the next psychology dean.

1126
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.528
And I know this wasn't part
of the plan.

1127
00:50:53.702 --> 00:50:56.314
but you two make a really
great couple.

1128
00:50:56.488 --> 00:50:59.317
-Oh. Mm-mm.

1129
00:50:59.491 --> 00:51:01.101
-I just...

1130
00:51:04.626 --> 00:51:07.412
-Hey.

1131
00:51:07.586 --> 00:51:10.502
-Sophie said that you did this
for me?

1132
00:51:10.676 --> 00:51:13.853
-I did. Surprised?

1133
00:51:14.027 --> 00:51:15.246
-Only that you wanted me
to watch you flirt

1134
00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.986
with a pretty professor.

1135
00:51:17.161 --> 00:51:18.379
-Flirt? No. No. no.

1136
00:51:18.553 --> 00:51:20.381
That... that was.
that was an act.

1137
00:51:20.555 --> 00:51:23.080
-Could have fooled me.

1138
00:51:23.254 --> 00:51:24.777
-I was doing this to.

1139
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:26.561
you know. show you that
I'm taking it seriously.

1140
00:51:26.735 --> 00:51:27.562
You know. impress you.

1141
00:51:27.736 --> 00:51:29.129
-You want to impress me?

1142
00:51:29.303 --> 00:51:29.999
Go back to your private practice
with Kyle.

1143
00:51:30.174 --> 00:51:31.566
-Taylor.

1144
00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.351
-Ryan. I really think
it's about time

1145
00:51:33.525 --> 00:51:36.005
that you give up this whole
dog adoption thing.

1146
00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:38.530
-This dog adoption thing
is my life's dream.

1147
00:51:38.704 --> 00:51:42.708
-Can't it be more.
you know. a hobby?

1148
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.760
-Have we always been this far
apart in what we want in life?

1149
00:51:56.548 --> 00:51:59.899
-Yeah. You just couldn't see it.

1150
00:52:00.073 --> 00:52:02.554
That fireball you felt
when we met.

1151
00:52:02.728 --> 00:52:06.862
it took time for the smoke
to clear.

1152
00:52:07.036 --> 00:52:09.735
Goodbye. Ryan.

1153
00:52:17.264 --> 00:52:20.311
-Hey. was she surprised?

1154
00:52:20.485 --> 00:52:21.877
-Uh. yes.

1155
00:52:22.051 --> 00:52:23.444
-So. the plan worked?

1156
00:52:23.618 --> 00:52:25.272
-Yes. you were.
you were really great.

1157
00:52:25.446 --> 00:52:27.883
You were very.
very convincing.

1158
00:52:28.057 --> 00:52:29.581
-Well. I mean. you too.

1159
00:52:29.755 --> 00:52:31.452
I mean. the look on your face
when you went on

1160
00:52:31.626 --> 00:52:35.064
about our moment on the dance
floor was Oscar worthy.

1161
00:52:35.239 --> 00:52:36.675
-Yeah.

1162
00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:42.028
-What?
-Nothing.

1163
00:52:42.202 --> 00:52:45.466
-Well. good night then.
And again. great acting job.

1164
00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.905
-Thank you. You too.
Oh. you forgot about the...

1165
00:52:50.079 --> 00:52:52.995
-Oh! Right.
Well. I'll save it.

1166
00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:54.954
In case you guys
break up again.

1167
00:52:55.128 --> 00:52:57.348
-Smart.

1168
00:52:57.522 --> 00:52:59.393
-Well. good night.

1169
00:52:59.567 --> 00:53:01.178
-Good night.

1170
00:53:15.453 --> 00:53:18.369
-It's true.
It's. it's the best feeling.

1171
00:53:18.543 --> 00:53:24.592
It's like this heavy blanket
on a cold morning.

1172
00:53:24.766 --> 00:53:30.294
It's warm and safe and you just
don't want to be anywhere else.

1173
00:53:30.468 --> 00:53:35.168
This feels. feels right.
and easy.

1174
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:42.262
-Get it together. Brooke.

1175
00:53:42.436 --> 00:53:43.916
Eye on the prize. girl.

1176
00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:46.223
You're only doing this
for damage control.

1177
00:53:46.397 --> 00:53:48.442
Not to find your...

1178
00:53:55.623 --> 00:53:58.191
I can't even convince myself.

1179
00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:10.986
-How's that?
You in pain. girl?

1180
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.466
-She's been walking fine.

1181
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.163
-I think she's good to go.

1182
00:54:14.338 --> 00:54:15.513
-Can I put her on
the adoption list?

1183
00:54:15.687 --> 00:54:17.210
-Yep. she's ready.

1184
00:54:17.384 --> 00:54:18.864
-Oh. you hear that. Molly?

1185
00:54:19.038 --> 00:54:20.344
You're gonna have a new home.

1186
00:54:20.518 --> 00:54:22.433
-Yeah. Probably sooner
than later.

1187
00:54:22.607 --> 00:54:24.565
-I'm gonna miss you. Molly.

1188
00:54:28.047 --> 00:54:30.397
-Jen. you mind
closing up tonight?

1189
00:54:30.571 --> 00:54:32.878
-Sure. Doctor Bennett.
Going out with Taylor?

1190
00:54:33.052 --> 00:54:37.186
-Nope. We broke up. actually.
For good this time.

1191
00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:38.579
-I'm sorry.

1192
00:54:38.753 --> 00:54:40.233
-Thanks. but she was never
on board

1193
00:54:40.407 --> 00:54:41.669
with this whole
dog adoption thing.

1194
00:54:41.843 --> 00:54:44.629
-I see. What does
Doctor Carver think?

1195
00:54:44.803 --> 00:54:46.152
Brooke?

1196
00:54:46.326 --> 00:54:47.893
-Yeah. yeah.
She's on board with it.

1197
00:54:48.067 --> 00:54:49.982
It's actually one of the things
we had in common.

1198
00:54:50.156 --> 00:54:51.549
Both in our dream jobs.

1199
00:54:51.723 --> 00:54:53.377
-I don't mean to pry.
Doctor Bennett.

1200
00:54:53.551 --> 00:54:56.597
but seeing you and Doctor
Carver in that new video...

1201
00:54:56.771 --> 00:54:58.164
-The one from last night?
That's up?

1202
00:54:58.338 --> 00:55:01.210
-Mm-hm. You two
are so cute together.

1203
00:55:01.385 --> 00:55:03.169
Maybe things will work out
with her?

1204
00:55:03.343 --> 00:55:06.303
-Doubtful. This is our
last date. tonight.

1205
00:55:06.477 --> 00:55:08.087
But thank you.

1206
00:55:08.261 --> 00:55:10.263
-Mm-hm.

1207
00:55:20.578 --> 00:55:24.103
-So. this is it.
Our romantic date.

1208
00:55:24.277 --> 00:55:25.800
-Oh. I can tell.

1209
00:55:25.974 --> 00:55:29.108
Candlelight. white table cloth.
overpriced wine.

1210
00:55:29.282 --> 00:55:31.458
-Hey. all this romance
doesn't come cheap.

1211
00:55:31.632 --> 00:55:32.981
-Not for you at all.

1212
00:55:33.155 --> 00:55:34.505
-Not true.

1213
00:55:34.679 --> 00:55:36.942
I do believe that people
feel something

1214
00:55:37.116 --> 00:55:38.857
that they call romance.

1215
00:55:39.031 --> 00:55:40.337
-And you call?

1216
00:55:40.511 --> 00:55:42.164
-A rush of feel good
neurochemicals

1217
00:55:42.339 --> 00:55:43.862
that flood the brain.
producing a wave of euphoria.

1218
00:55:44.036 --> 00:55:45.820
-Hm. You know what?

1219
00:55:45.994 --> 00:55:48.040
I think I'll just stick with
good old-fashioned romance.

1220
00:55:48.214 --> 00:55:51.348
-Suit yourself. Did you bring
the gift?

1221
00:55:51.522 --> 00:55:52.479
-You?

1222
00:55:55.177 --> 00:55:56.178
-You first.

1223
00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:10.062
-As long as you're dancing
nothing can hurt you.

1224
00:56:10.236 --> 00:56:12.281
Aw. Just what I wanted.
Dance lessons.

1225
00:56:12.456 --> 00:56:13.805
-For the man
who has everything.

1226
00:56:13.979 --> 00:56:16.373
-Including two left feet.

1227
00:56:19.071 --> 00:56:21.203
-You're not. you know. offended?

1228
00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:24.293
-Not at all.
No. thank you.

1229
00:56:27.209 --> 00:56:31.997
I'll think about you every time
I step on my partner's toes.

1230
00:56:34.347 --> 00:56:37.002
Ok. Your turn.

1231
00:56:40.353 --> 00:56:43.487
-Oh. it's very light.
It's definitely not a book.

1232
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:45.140
-No. I saw your office.

1233
00:56:45.314 --> 00:56:48.143
You have more books
than a school library.

1234
00:56:48.317 --> 00:56:49.318
-Well. it's not jewelry.

1235
00:56:49.493 --> 00:56:51.408
-That's far too romantic.

1236
00:56:51.582 --> 00:56:55.063
Hate to see you hit by a rogue
wave of neurochemicals.

1237
00:56:55.237 --> 00:56:57.849
-Ah. well... I'll...

1238
00:56:58.023 --> 00:56:59.067
-Just open it.

1239
00:56:59.241 --> 00:57:00.634
-Ok. Ok.

1240
00:57:04.159 --> 00:57:07.162
Screech!

1241
00:57:07.336 --> 00:57:08.337
-Hope it's ok.

1242
00:57:08.512 --> 00:57:10.165
-It's perfect.

1243
00:57:10.339 --> 00:57:12.559
It's just like the one I had
when I was growing up.

1244
00:57:14.387 --> 00:57:18.565
And just as cuddly.
Thank you.

1245
00:57:20.262 --> 00:57:21.438
-You're very welcome.

1246
00:57:22.003 --> 00:57:23.048
-Um.

1247
00:57:45.418 --> 00:57:47.420
-So. our last date.

1248
00:57:47.594 --> 00:57:49.030
-It is.

1249
00:57:49.204 --> 00:57:51.990
-Is there a formal way
to end the study?

1250
00:57:52.164 --> 00:57:56.995
-You know. say goodbye.
It's been fun. keep in touch.

1251
00:57:57.169 --> 00:57:59.476
You know. catch you
on the flip side.

1252
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:00.955
-I don't think anybody says
that anymore.

1253
00:58:01.129 --> 00:58:02.957
-I say that.
-Ok.

1254
00:58:03.131 --> 00:58:04.872
Hey. what if uh...

1255
00:58:05.046 --> 00:58:06.831
-What?

1256
00:58:07.005 --> 00:58:10.878
-What if I wanted to have.
I don't know. one more date?

1257
00:58:11.052 --> 00:58:13.228
-To show Taylor
that this is something

1258
00:58:13.402 --> 00:58:15.840
you're really invested in?

1259
00:58:16.014 --> 00:58:18.320
-Uh.

1260
00:58:18.495 --> 00:58:20.018
-I'd do another date.

1261
00:58:20.192 --> 00:58:21.802
-Me too.

1262
00:58:21.976 --> 00:58:23.891
-I mean. we could go on
one of the bonus dates.

1263
00:58:24.065 --> 00:58:25.371
-Bonus dates?

1264
00:58:25.545 --> 00:58:26.851
-It's in your folder.
Appendix B.

1265
00:58:27.025 --> 00:58:30.507
There's an artsy date.
an exercise date.

1266
00:58:30.681 --> 00:58:31.812
a new-experiences date.

1267
00:58:31.986 --> 00:58:33.901
-Yeah. What's that?

1268
00:58:34.075 --> 00:58:36.948
-It's something neither of us
has done before.

1269
00:58:37.122 --> 00:58:39.167
-So. one more date.

1270
00:58:39.341 --> 00:58:42.127
-One more date.

1271
00:59:00.101 --> 00:59:01.363
-You're singing.

1272
00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:02.974
-Oh. sorry. was I
interrupting you?

1273
00:59:03.148 --> 00:59:04.932
-No. no. It's great.

1274
00:59:05.106 --> 00:59:06.194
-Ok.

1275
00:59:06.368 --> 00:59:07.935
-You are really happy lately.

1276
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:09.850
Happier than I've seen you
in a very long time.

1277
00:59:10.024 --> 00:59:11.809
-Carly. I know where
you're going with this

1278
00:59:11.983 --> 00:59:14.942
and it has nothing to do
with Ryan.

1279
00:59:15.116 --> 00:59:15.943
-Really?
-Mm-Hm.

1280
00:59:16.117 --> 00:59:17.205
-Hmm.

1281
00:59:19.077 --> 00:59:22.471
-Wow. You're up to six.

1282
00:59:22.646 --> 00:59:24.343
So much for one more date.

1283
00:59:24.517 --> 00:59:26.954
-Now the study has more
variables to ascertain.

1284
00:59:27.128 --> 00:59:28.869
-Oh. Brooke. Would you listen
to yourself?

1285
00:59:29.043 --> 00:59:31.263
Human emotions do not compute.

1286
00:59:31.437 --> 00:59:34.005
I am equipped with
a data-driven heart.

1287
00:59:34.179 --> 00:59:36.224
Boop-boop. Boop-boop.

1288
00:59:36.398 --> 00:59:37.835
-Are you finished?

1289
00:59:38.009 --> 00:59:38.662
-Boop.

1290
00:59:40.794 --> 00:59:44.450
It's obvious.
You've fallen for him.

1291
00:59:44.624 --> 00:59:46.017
-What? No.

1292
00:59:46.191 --> 00:59:48.236
-He is your screen saver.

1293
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:49.977
-Agh-agh. no.

1294
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:52.850
We saw an old photo booth
at the bowling alley.

1295
00:59:53.024 --> 00:59:54.373
-Huh. Cute stuffed toy.

1296
00:59:54.547 --> 00:59:55.896
-We had a gift giving date.

1297
00:59:56.070 --> 00:59:56.984
-Flowers?

1298
00:59:57.158 --> 00:59:58.856
-I bought those.

1299
00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:01.032
-Still. two out of three.
Better than my average lately.

1300
01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:02.990
-Your dates?

1301
01:00:03.164 --> 01:00:04.296
What. the three-question thing
isn't working out for you?

1302
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:06.559
-Ugh. Train wreck.
Every guy.

1303
01:00:06.733 --> 01:00:08.169
-Oh. I'm sorry.

1304
01:00:08.343 --> 01:00:09.954
-Like I ask one guy.
name a cheesy song.

1305
01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:12.957
He goes "I don't know
any songs about cheese."

1306
01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:14.523
Think that's bad?

1307
01:00:14.698 --> 01:00:17.004
Two guys said that their
ideal dinner guest

1308
01:00:17.178 --> 01:00:18.397
would be Kim Kardashian.

1309
01:00:18.571 --> 01:00:20.051
-Oh. gosh.

1310
01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:22.270
-Should have just skipped
the third question.

1311
01:00:22.444 --> 01:00:25.056
-What's the most beautiful view
you've ever seen.

1312
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.884
Wait. don't tell me.

1313
01:00:27.058 --> 01:00:28.407
Kim Kardashian.

1314
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:31.410
-So. no poetry and sappy
love songs.

1315
01:00:31.584 --> 01:00:33.238
-The last guy scored
negative seven.

1316
01:00:33.412 --> 01:00:35.066
-I'm so sorry. Carly.

1317
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.896
-Whatever. But you two clearly
have something going on.

1318
01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:40.985
Your scores are in the 90's.

1319
01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:42.682
-The study's goal is 95.

1320
01:00:42.856 --> 01:00:47.382
-But how did he score
where it counts? Here.

1321
01:00:47.556 --> 01:00:49.036
-The study doesn't have
a protocol.

1322
01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.299
-Oh. and the robot is back.

1323
01:00:51.473 --> 01:00:53.388
-Oh. ok. You're right.

1324
01:00:53.562 --> 01:00:58.611
Ryan is great and funny and
charming and kind of sweet.

1325
01:00:58.785 --> 01:01:00.265
-I knew it.

1326
01:01:00.439 --> 01:01:02.310
-Who's trying to get back
with his girlfriend.

1327
01:01:02.484 --> 01:01:03.921
-By going on more dates
with you?

1328
01:01:04.095 --> 01:01:05.531
-To show her he's invested.

1329
01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:08.012
-Look. ok. I have seen you
with Logan.

1330
01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:09.927
with Landon. with Lucas...

1331
01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:11.276
-There was no Lucas!

1332
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.278
-And now I've seen you
with Ryan

1333
01:01:13.452 --> 01:01:15.976
and I've never seen you
so happy.

1334
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:20.024
I mean. you are singing.

1335
01:01:20.198 --> 01:01:22.113
-Ok. but the thing is Carly.

1336
01:01:22.287 --> 01:01:25.116
I was happy with Logan
and Landon

1337
01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:27.509
and pretty much every guy
I've ever dated

1338
01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:30.469
but I can't expose
my heart again

1339
01:01:30.643 --> 01:01:34.081
and watch it crumble
into a sad pile of rubble.

1340
01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:39.173
-Ok. I'll let it go.
For now.

1341
01:01:39.347 --> 01:01:43.090
-Look. we have one more date.
this Saturday night

1342
01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:45.527
and then I will thank him
for doing the dating test

1343
01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:51.011
and say bye and never
see him again.

1344
01:01:51.185 --> 01:01:53.144
-Except on your screen saver.

1345
01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:55.799
-Oh. right. I'll delete that.

1346
01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:12.163
-Ready for a new experience?

1347
01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:13.468
-Ok.

1348
01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.127
-Are you sure about this?

1349
01:02:20.301 --> 01:02:21.302
-Yes. Neither of us
have baked before.

1350
01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:23.043
This is gonna be fun.

1351
01:02:23.217 --> 01:02:24.915
-Hm. You said the same thing
about bowling.

1352
01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:26.873
So. what are we making?

1353
01:02:27.047 --> 01:02:29.006
-You like chocolate?

1354
01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.964
-Of course.

1355
01:02:31.138 --> 01:02:33.532
In fact. studies show that nine
out of 10 women like chocolate.

1356
01:02:33.706 --> 01:02:35.012
The tenth is lying.

1357
01:02:35.186 --> 01:02:39.190
-Oh. buh-dum-ching.

1358
01:02:39.364 --> 01:02:42.062
-Ok. so. Chocolate what?
Mousse?

1359
01:02:42.236 --> 01:02:44.412
-Oh la la. You do set
the bar high.

1360
01:02:44.586 --> 01:02:45.892
-Cake?

1361
01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:47.894
-Hm. That requires layers.
Lower.

1362
01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:48.982
-Brownies?

1363
01:02:49.156 --> 01:02:51.028
-Lower.

1364
01:02:51.202 --> 01:02:53.160
-If we go any lower we'll be
licking batter off our fingers.

1365
01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:56.947
-Well that does sound weirdly
appealing. but no.

1366
01:02:57.121 --> 01:03:00.864
How do triple threat chocolate
fudge cookies sound?

1367
01:03:01.038 --> 01:03:02.561
-Threatening.
What's in 'em?

1368
01:03:02.735 --> 01:03:05.085
-Dark chocolate chips.
white chocolate chips.

1369
01:03:05.259 --> 01:03:08.001
chocolate covered walnuts
with a chocolate drizzle.

1370
01:03:08.175 --> 01:03:09.873
-That would actually be
a quadruple threat.

1371
01:03:10.047 --> 01:03:12.266
-Wow. only you would count.

1372
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.746
-So. where's the recipe?

1373
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.054
-No recipe. It's gonna
be an adventure.

1374
01:03:17.228 --> 01:03:20.013
-It'll be inedible.
We need a recipe.

1375
01:03:23.538 --> 01:03:24.452
-Ok. come on.

1376
01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:26.106
Let's cook from here.

1377
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.892
-Romantic but not practical.
We need a recipe.

1378
01:03:29.066 --> 01:03:32.983
-Brooke. where is your
adventurous spirit?

1379
01:03:33.157 --> 01:03:35.550
-Ok then.

1380
01:03:35.724 --> 01:03:36.987
Let the fun begin.

1381
01:03:37.161 --> 01:03:41.034
-Ok. That's the spirit.

1382
01:04:36.002 --> 01:04:39.963
-Ok. Moment of truth?

1383
01:04:40.137 --> 01:04:41.965
-Please. Ladies first.

1384
01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:45.882
-You're either very chivalrous
or very cowardly.

1385
01:04:46.056 --> 01:04:47.579
-Let's try them
at the same time.

1386
01:04:47.753 --> 01:04:49.276
-Ok.

1387
01:04:59.156 --> 01:05:00.853
-That's not bad.

1388
01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:02.159
-Not bad at all. considering
we didn't use a recipe.

1389
01:05:02.333 --> 01:05:04.161
-Well. you see?

1390
01:05:04.335 --> 01:05:06.206
-Is this your "I told you so"
moment?

1391
01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.949
-No. this just shows that you
can use this instead of this.

1392
01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:12.865
-I'd rather use this.

1393
01:05:13.039 --> 01:05:14.562
-I'm just saying that.
you know.

1394
01:05:14.736 --> 01:05:17.174
not everything needs to be
measured and quantified.

1395
01:05:17.348 --> 01:05:19.350
-Definitely an "I told you so"
moment.

1396
01:05:19.524 --> 01:05:21.830
Bottom line. these are great.

1397
01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:23.397
-Hmm. Perfect.

1398
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:31.275
-Uh. speaking of which. you
never answered question 11.

1399
01:05:31.449 --> 01:05:33.364
Describe a perfect day
you've had.

1400
01:05:33.538 --> 01:05:37.194
-Ah. well. lately that would
be every day.

1401
01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:39.022
-How so?

1402
01:05:39.196 --> 01:05:42.895
-Rather than tell you.
why don't I show you?

1403
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:44.027
-Ah what. now?

1404
01:05:44.201 --> 01:05:46.246
-Yeah. Yeah. Right now.

1405
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.901
-Ok. Can I bring the cookies?

1406
01:05:49.075 --> 01:05:50.598
-Sure.
-Ok.

1407
01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:53.036
-As long as you're willing
to share.

1408
01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:05.831
-My perfect day
would start here.

1409
01:06:06.005 --> 01:06:07.006
-At work?

1410
01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.443
-Well. it's not work to me.

1411
01:06:09.617 --> 01:06:11.097
-Do I get the full tour
this time?

1412
01:06:11.271 --> 01:06:13.360
-Sure. Gonna leave
the cookies here though.

1413
01:06:13.534 --> 01:06:14.405
-Oh.

1414
01:06:16.276 --> 01:06:19.062
-Ok. Let's go.

1415
01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:24.806
And over here. these are
all of our dogs.

1416
01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:25.982
-I could adopt them all.

1417
01:06:26.156 --> 01:06:27.766
-Well. that can be arranged.

1418
01:06:29.768 --> 01:06:33.815
-Oh! Here's a cutie! Hello.

1419
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.904
-Molly. this is Brooke.

1420
01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:37.819
-Hi Molly.

1421
01:06:41.475 --> 01:06:42.607
-Oh. she says hi.

1422
01:06:42.781 --> 01:06:44.174
-Oh. what a smart dog.

1423
01:06:44.348 --> 01:06:46.045
-She says "adopt me."

1424
01:06:46.219 --> 01:06:49.875
-Aww. I wish.
But if I ever do...

1425
01:06:50.049 --> 01:06:50.876
-Uh-oh.
-Hello!

1426
01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:52.225
-Someone's jealous.

1427
01:06:52.399 --> 01:06:53.879
-Oh! Hi.

1428
01:06:54.053 --> 01:06:55.359
-This is Max. my dog.

1429
01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:59.058
-Hello Max!
Oh. you're beautiful too.

1430
01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:00.799
-What do you think.
should we take them for a walk?

1431
01:07:03.106 --> 01:07:04.455
-That's a yes.

1432
01:07:06.239 --> 01:07:07.197
Yes.

1433
01:07:11.331 --> 01:07:13.333
-So. how did I score
on the test?

1434
01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:17.946
-Thursday night I am giving
a speech to release the study

1435
01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:19.905
and I'll reveal the scores.

1436
01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:22.386
-Hm. How did I do?

1437
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.214
-Oh. you've been replaced.

1438
01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:28.348
-Good choice.

1439
01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:31.221
-Oh. oh.
-Hey. Molly.

1440
01:07:31.395 --> 01:07:32.526
-Come here.

1441
01:07:35.486 --> 01:07:37.096
Molly come here.

1442
01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:41.492
Well. that works.

1443
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:47.889
Well. admit it.
you're in love.

1444
01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.500
-Ryan. I...

1445
01:07:49.674 --> 01:07:51.893
-With Molly.

1446
01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:55.288
I mean. she is definitely
in love with you.

1447
01:07:55.462 --> 01:07:58.422
-Oh. and how do you know that?

1448
01:07:58.596 --> 01:08:00.206
-Doctor Bennett?

1449
01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.818
-Well. the way she looks at you.
I mean. checking on you.

1450
01:08:03.992 --> 01:08:05.342
-With those eyes.

1451
01:08:05.516 --> 01:08:08.388
-She's up for adoption.
just saying.

1452
01:08:08.562 --> 01:08:10.695
-I'll keep that in mind.

1453
01:08:11.435 --> 01:08:12.827
-So. what about people.
Doctor Carver.

1454
01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:14.960
how do you tell
when they're in love?

1455
01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:17.136
-Well. you know. the usual.

1456
01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:20.661
Just dilated pupils.
racing heart. sweaty palms.

1457
01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:30.844
-I should get these guys inside.
Come on. let's go!

1458
01:08:31.019 --> 01:08:34.022
Let's go. let's go. let's go.

1459
01:08:48.602 --> 01:08:51.300
So. that was my perfect day.

1460
01:08:51.475 --> 01:08:54.041
-Thank you for sharing it
with me.

1461
01:08:54.217 --> 01:08:56.131
-My pleasure.

1462
01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.919
So. I was reading Appendix B

1463
01:09:01.093 --> 01:09:04.227
and it says that this was our
last bonus date.

1464
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:08.796
-Yes. it is.
Oh. no. Um...

1465
01:09:08.969 --> 01:09:10.319
-What?

1466
01:09:10.494 --> 01:09:12.148
-Oh no. it's a...
it's a big day tomorrow.

1467
01:09:12.322 --> 01:09:14.585
I just. I'm polishing the script
and rehearsing all day.

1468
01:09:14.759 --> 01:09:16.238
-I can help you rehearse
if you want.

1469
01:09:16.413 --> 01:09:20.068
-Yeah. Thanks. thanks.
But it's... I should go.

1470
01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:21.809
-Right.

1471
01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:27.380
-Um. It's been great.
It's been really great.

1472
01:09:27.554 --> 01:09:31.602
Thank you for everything.
Give Molly a big hug for me.

1473
01:09:31.776 --> 01:09:33.821
-Yeah. I will.

1474
01:09:33.995 --> 01:09:39.130
-So. I guess this is goodnight.
And goodbye.

1475
01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:48.095
-Yeah. Um. oh.
This is your device.

1476
01:09:48.271 --> 01:09:50.664
-Thank you. Doctor Bennett.

1477
01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:58.019
-Catch you on the flip side.

1478
01:10:01.109 --> 01:10:03.155
-I love it. Great job.

1479
01:10:03.329 --> 01:10:04.896
-It's a really nice speech.
Brooke.

1480
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:07.202
-This is gonna be a huge boon
to the university.

1481
01:10:07.377 --> 01:10:08.900
The visibility we'll get
from this.

1482
01:10:09.074 --> 01:10:10.945
-I invited local media
to cover.

1483
01:10:11.119 --> 01:10:13.034
-Now. it's important. Brooke.
that you don't reveal

1484
01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.166
the attraction tracker score
until tomorrow night.

1485
01:10:15.341 --> 01:10:16.864
-And. please don't tell anyone
the real reason

1486
01:10:17.038 --> 01:10:18.300
you did the test.

1487
01:10:18.475 --> 01:10:19.954
-What do we say to people

1488
01:10:20.128 --> 01:10:21.913
when they see they didn't
fall in love?

1489
01:10:22.087 --> 01:10:24.045
-Well that can actually lend
some credibility to the study.

1490
01:10:24.219 --> 01:10:25.873
There simply wasn't
much attraction

1491
01:10:26.047 --> 01:10:27.657
between Brooke and Ryan.

1492
01:10:27.832 --> 01:10:30.226
-We can't say that.
I mean. look at the scores.

1493
01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.403
-Well. then maybe there simply
wasn't enough attraction.

1494
01:10:33.577 --> 01:10:35.405
-That sound good to you. Brooke?

1495
01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:37.537
-Yes. of course.

1496
01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:40.888
I mean. if study participants
don't reach 95

1497
01:10:41.062 --> 01:10:44.109
then it's time to move on.

1498
01:10:56.513 --> 01:10:59.255
-Ok. Tell me.

1499
01:10:59.429 --> 01:11:01.213
-Kyle. I. I. I told you.

1500
01:11:01.387 --> 01:11:04.303
I signed an 18-page contract
agreeing not to say anything

1501
01:11:04.477 --> 01:11:06.305
until the study is released.

1502
01:11:06.478 --> 01:11:08.568
-Come on. you don't need a
score to tell you how you feel.

1503
01:11:08.742 --> 01:11:11.049
Is Brooke the one?

1504
01:11:11.223 --> 01:11:12.093
-Kyle.

1505
01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:15.271
-Come on. Is she the one?

1506
01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:19.971
Hmm?

1507
01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:23.540
-Yes. Yes.

1508
01:11:23.714 --> 01:11:26.151
-I knew it! I knew it.

1509
01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:28.893
The way you talked about her. it
was never like this with Taylor.

1510
01:11:29.067 --> 01:11:30.547
-Don't say anything. ok.
Not even to Sophie.

1511
01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:33.550
-Ok. What about Brooke?
How does she feel?

1512
01:11:33.724 --> 01:11:36.030
-I'm not sure.
Not that it matters.

1513
01:11:36.204 --> 01:11:38.903
-Of course. it matters.
It's kind of how love works.

1514
01:11:39.077 --> 01:11:40.208
-Well not when one of us
has vowed

1515
01:11:40.383 --> 01:11:42.646
never to fall in love again.

1516
01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:43.951
-Brooke. right?

1517
01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:46.127
-No. me. Yes. Brooke.

1518
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.041
She said she's done with dating.

1519
01:11:48.216 --> 01:11:51.871
-Well. that's what Sophie said
and three months later

1520
01:11:52.046 --> 01:11:53.960
we were engaged.

1521
01:11:54.135 --> 01:11:56.050
-She's just tired of dealing
with heartbreak.

1522
01:11:56.224 --> 01:11:59.619
-Maybe this time
she won't have to.

1523
01:11:59.793 --> 01:12:03.928
-Yeah. maybe. but...
she likes numbers. you know?

1524
01:12:04.102 --> 01:12:05.451
Not feelings.

1525
01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:07.410
She wants love plotted out

1526
01:12:07.584 --> 01:12:09.977
like data points on a graph.

1527
01:12:10.151 --> 01:12:11.630
-You know what I think?

1528
01:12:11.805 --> 01:12:15.592
I think you should tell her
how you feel.

1529
01:12:15.766 --> 01:12:17.376
-I don't know.

1530
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:21.032
-She may be a scientist.
but she still has feelings.

1531
01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:29.910
-So. at this point I'm going
to reveal the score.

1532
01:12:30.084 --> 01:12:32.870
So. I'll cross to the stage.

1533
01:12:33.044 --> 01:12:35.525
and behind me will be
a graphics showing...

1534
01:12:37.527 --> 01:12:39.311
Ryan?

1535
01:12:39.485 --> 01:12:43.010
-I was told that I might find
you here.

1536
01:12:43.184 --> 01:12:47.145
-Lou. can we take a quick break?
Great. thanks.

1537
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:53.020
Hey. what's up?

1538
01:12:53.193 --> 01:12:55.327
-I know you're busy.
I won't be long.

1539
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:57.895
-Oh. it' s ok.
What's wrong?

1540
01:12:58.068 --> 01:13:01.159
I've never seen your serious
face before.

1541
01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:02.987
-This? Yeah. I know.

1542
01:13:03.161 --> 01:13:06.947
I only bring it out for funerals
and breakup speeches.

1543
01:13:07.121 --> 01:13:08.645
-Which is this?

1544
01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:11.212
-Neither. Although I did
break up with Taylor.

1545
01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.868
-Oh. I'm sorry. When?

1546
01:13:15.041 --> 01:13:17.393
-Uh. like last week.

1547
01:13:17.567 --> 01:13:19.177
-Last week?

1548
01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:21.484
-Yes. I should have told you.

1549
01:13:21.657 --> 01:13:23.355
-We went on all those
bonus dates.

1550
01:13:23.529 --> 01:13:28.099
-I know. I know. and I didn't go
on them to impress Taylor.

1551
01:13:28.273 --> 01:13:31.232
I went on them to-
because...

1552
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.980
Well. I think I'm in love
with you.

1553
01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:42.330
-What?

1554
01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:46.552
-And. so. I'm here you know.

1555
01:13:46.726 --> 01:13:49.032
to see if maybe you feel
the same way.

1556
01:13:49.207 --> 01:13:53.166
-Um. What happened
to love at first sight?

1557
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:55.909
-I was wrong.

1558
01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:57.433
When we danced.

1559
01:13:57.607 --> 01:14:00.044
I felt this flicker
and that flame.

1560
01:14:00.218 --> 01:14:02.046
it just seems to grow brighter.

1561
01:14:02.219 --> 01:14:05.832
Every time that I see you.

1562
01:14:06.005 --> 01:14:09.967
-Um. Ryan. my big speech
is tomorrow and...

1563
01:14:10.141 --> 01:14:11.577
-I know.

1564
01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:12.839
-I mean. there's a lot
riding on this.

1565
01:14:13.013 --> 01:14:14.275
Donations. enrollment.
ranking.

1566
01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:15.929
The president wants
to make me Dean.

1567
01:14:16.103 --> 01:14:17.975
-I just thought...

1568
01:14:18.148 --> 01:14:23.371
-Yes. there was some attraction
as reflected in our scores.

1569
01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:25.939
-Scores. Stop it.
Stop with the scores.

1570
01:14:26.112 --> 01:14:28.246
Come on. What are.
what are your feelings?

1571
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:31.379
-Feelings. I. I shut those down
a while ago.

1572
01:14:31.554 --> 01:14:36.254
-Brooke. I felt something
from you.

1573
01:14:36.428 --> 01:14:39.257
-I'm sorry. I. I never should
have let it slip out.

1574
01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:42.478
-Slip out. Brooke.
What are you...

1575
01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:46.656
-Ryan. I can't do this.
Please just try to understand.

1576
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:52.313
I. I've had my heart broken
so many times.

1577
01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:57.231
As if I lost part of it.
somewhere along the line.

1578
01:14:57.405 --> 01:14:59.582
I'm sorry.

1579
01:15:10.767 --> 01:15:12.464
And after the three
required dates.

1580
01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:15.032
we decided to try some
bonus dates.

1581
01:15:15.206 --> 01:15:19.471
We visited an art museum.
rode a tandem bike.

1582
01:15:19.645 --> 01:15:23.127
I even learned to bake cookies
without using a recipe.

1583
01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.912
A sweet adventure.

1584
01:15:26.085 --> 01:15:29.263
All the while waiting to see
if cupid's arrow would strike.

1585
01:15:29.437 --> 01:15:31.483
Ugh. Enough about cupid.

1586
01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:37.097
All the while waiting to see
if a spark would ignite

1587
01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:40.666
a flame within our hearts.

1588
01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:45.844
Nope. sounds like heartburn.
Blah. blah. blah.

1589
01:15:46.019 --> 01:15:48.021
And now. for the big reveal.

1590
01:15:48.195 --> 01:15:49.501
The question everyone
wants to know.

1591
01:15:49.675 --> 01:15:54.027
Did I fall in love.
find the one?

1592
01:15:58.205 --> 01:15:59.642
-There you are.

1593
01:15:59.816 --> 01:16:02.949
-Oh. My favorite flower.

1594
01:16:03.123 --> 01:16:04.907
-Good. 'Cause there's
a long trail of them

1595
01:16:05.082 --> 01:16:07.214
leading to your office.

1596
01:16:48.516 --> 01:16:50.954
-They must be from Ryan.

1597
01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:55.306
-Huh. What a funny. charming.
kind of sweet guy.

1598
01:17:11.278 --> 01:17:15.108
Think he still wants to get back
with his girlfriend?

1599
01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:22.898
-"Dear Brooke. I want you
to know how much

1600
01:17:23.073 --> 01:17:25.118
"I enjoyed my time with you.

1601
01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:30.080
"I will truly miss you.

1602
01:17:31.777 --> 01:17:36.041
"Your smile. your adventurous
baking.

1603
01:17:36.216 --> 01:17:38.305
"Your crazy bowling skills.

1604
01:17:42.309 --> 01:17:45.269
"I know you've had your heart
broken one too many times

1605
01:17:45.443 --> 01:17:48.880
"but I hope you don't give
up on finding love.

1606
01:17:49.055 --> 01:17:50.621
"You have a warm.
beautiful heart

1607
01:17:50.796 --> 01:17:53.581
"that deserves to be shared by
some lucky guy.

1608
01:17:53.755 --> 01:17:57.020
"Anyway. please accept
this parting gift

1609
01:17:57.193 --> 01:17:59.892
"to help make your day
a little more perfect.

1610
01:18:00.066 --> 01:18:02.590
"Your devoted study partner.
Ryan."

1611
01:18:27.398 --> 01:18:28.704
-You coming?

1612
01:18:30.487 --> 01:18:31.228
What's going on?

1613
01:18:31.402 --> 01:18:32.795
-Ah. not going.

1614
01:18:35.014 --> 01:18:37.974
-Isn't Brooke giving the dating
test results in like 20 minutes?

1615
01:18:38.148 --> 01:18:39.540
-Yeah. but it doesn't matter.

1616
01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:41.541
The results. they don't
mean anything.

1617
01:18:46.068 --> 01:18:47.940
I mean. I tried.

1618
01:18:48.114 --> 01:18:51.117
I tried to get through to her
but she just.

1619
01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:53.903
she doesn't feel
the same way.

1620
01:19:17.013 --> 01:19:19.406
-There she is.
looking every bit the star.

1621
01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:20.451
-Thanks Rebecca.

1622
01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:21.321
-You look great. Brooke.

1623
01:19:21.495 --> 01:19:22.975
-Thanks. Vince.

1624
01:19:23.148 --> 01:19:23.976
-Uh. Vince. can you give us
a second please?

1625
01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:25.934
-Oh. of course. Yeah.

1626
01:19:26.109 --> 01:19:27.545
-Brooke. I don't know if you've
had time to think about

1627
01:19:27.719 --> 01:19:29.068
the Dean of Psychology position?

1628
01:19:29.242 --> 01:19:30.896
-I have. yes.
-Oh. good.

1629
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:32.855
I mean. I can't
say this publicly.

1630
01:19:33.029 --> 01:19:36.162
but you'd be at the top
of my list.

1631
01:19:36.335 --> 01:19:39.862
-Thank you. Rebecca.
but I won't be applying.

1632
01:19:40.036 --> 01:19:41.777
-What? Why not?

1633
01:19:41.951 --> 01:19:44.388
-Being Dean wouldn't leave
enough time for my research.

1634
01:19:44.562 --> 01:19:48.130
It's why I became a scientist.
That's where my heart is.

1635
01:19:48.305 --> 01:19:53.223
-Oh. I see. Well. I can't say
I'm not disappointed.

1636
01:19:53.397 --> 01:19:56.269
But. I respect your decision.

1637
01:19:56.443 --> 01:19:59.011
A woman who follows her heart

1638
01:19:59.184 --> 01:20:02.362
and I trust you're applying that
in your love life as well.

1639
01:20:02.536 --> 01:20:05.975
-It's show time. Oh. and for
tonight. maybe it's best to...

1640
01:20:06.148 --> 01:20:07.193
-Stick to the script.
Got it.

1641
01:20:07.367 --> 01:20:08.325
-Yeah.

1642
01:20:13.678 --> 01:20:15.245
-And you'd think after
the bowling and the dancing

1643
01:20:15.419 --> 01:20:18.117
we'd call it quits. but no.

1644
01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:20.163
After the three required dates.

1645
01:20:20.337 --> 01:20:22.295
we decided to try some
bonus dates.

1646
01:20:22.469 --> 01:20:25.342
We visited an art museum.
rode a tandem bike...

1647
01:20:25.516 --> 01:20:29.999
I even learned to bake cookies
without using a recipe.

1648
01:20:30.173 --> 01:20:31.174
A sweet adventure.

1649
01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:34.438
All the while.
waiting for a spark

1650
01:20:34.612 --> 01:20:37.920
to ignite a flame
within our hearts.

1651
01:20:38.094 --> 01:20:41.401
And. it did.

1652
01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:43.403
In mine. at least.

1653
01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:49.018
Her name is Molly and she is the
most adorable rescue dog ever.

1654
01:20:49.192 --> 01:20:50.454
So now for the big reveal.

1655
01:20:51.889 --> 01:20:53.413
-Excuse me. I had a question.

1656
01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:55.546
-Uh yes. there'll be time
for questions at the end.

1657
01:20:58.114 --> 01:21:02.553
-I was just wondering
if you fell in love.

1658
01:21:02.727 --> 01:21:05.121
You know. found the one?

1659
01:21:09.038 --> 01:21:12.432
-Yes. Yes. I did.

1660
01:21:12.606 --> 01:21:16.871
I did fall in love. but I was
afraid to tell the man

1661
01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:18.351
that I fell in love with.

1662
01:21:18.525 --> 01:21:20.309
It's the story of my life.
really.

1663
01:21:20.484 --> 01:21:23.922
Turns out. there's more
to learn from my research.

1664
01:21:24.096 --> 01:21:32.017
Love is infinite. mysterious
and goes much deeper than data.

1665
01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:34.063
You see. I had given up
on love.

1666
01:21:34.237 --> 01:21:36.152
Afraid my heart would take
another beating.

1667
01:21:36.326 --> 01:21:38.589
But. to be in love.

1668
01:21:38.763 --> 01:21:44.202
even just for a short time
is worth the heartbreak.

1669
01:21:50.557 --> 01:21:53.517
-That's so sweet.
-Cue the romantic music. right?

1670
01:21:53.691 --> 01:21:58.043
-A good cheesy love song.
-Cheesier the better.

1671
01:21:58.217 --> 01:22:03.048
-Um. random question. but who'd
be your ideal dinner guest?

1672
01:22:03.222 --> 01:22:06.312
-Frost. Dickinson.
Nope. Whitman.

1673
01:22:06.486 --> 01:22:08.967
I like poetry.

1674
01:22:09.141 --> 01:22:10.751
-Two out of three.

1675
01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:16.018
And. um. what's the most
beautiful view you've ever seen?

1676
01:22:16.192 --> 01:22:18.281
-The one I'm looking at.

1677
01:22:21.023 --> 01:22:22.633
-Sorry to interrupt. folks.

1678
01:22:22.807 --> 01:22:25.027
But. in case you didn't know.

1679
01:22:25.201 --> 01:22:29.639
our new marketing slogan
is Research with Heart.

1680
01:22:29.814 --> 01:22:33.861
Which is exactly what Doctor
Carver showed tonight.

1681
01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:35.689
Heart.

1682
01:22:35.862 --> 01:22:39.432
So. I have decided to postpone
our study's release.

1683
01:22:39.606 --> 01:22:43.045
Sounds like some revisions
are in order.

1684
01:22:43.219 --> 01:22:46.178
That ok with you?

1685
01:22:47.788 --> 01:22:51.227
-Remember Brooke.
follow your heart.

1686
01:22:59.452 --> 01:23:02.934
-Thanks for the flowers.
The way to a woman's heart.

1687
01:23:03.108 --> 01:23:05.110
-Well. like I said.

1688
01:23:05.284 --> 01:23:08.026
just trying to make your day
a little more perfect.

1689
01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:11.987
-Well. there is one thing
that could make it more perfect.

1690
01:23:21.170 --> 01:23:22.084
-Yes!

1691
01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.826
That's my boy!
