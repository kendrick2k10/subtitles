This programme contains very
strong language.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.800

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.840
One. take one up on the board.

6
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.600
All right. cool. I'm good to go.

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.000
I would always like to think that
I'm someone who. when people come

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.720
and see my show. they say. yo. like.
he cares and he...he puts in effort

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.440
and he really dedicates himself to
giving us an amazing show.

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.120
I gotta go in for my people.
in whatever aspect that is. whatever

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.960
idea. whatever theme I decide to
do for a show.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.680
I'm...I'm gonna go in.

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.760
What can fans expect from the show?

14
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.680
I think first and foremost.
amazing music.

15
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.320
This is the first time I'm playing.
like. the whole album.

16
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.760
So it's heavily focused on music.

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.240
So that's where we've really
gone in. on the music.

18
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.440
and bringing out
the soul of the album

19
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.920
and the spirit of the album. and
allowing it to just be projected

20
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.680
through every instrument and every
voice that's on that stage.

21
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.800
Like. I feel like this is the most
complete Stormzy set. like.

22
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.720
that I'm ever gonna perform.

23
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.040
Every facet of myself.
whether it's my vulnerability.

24
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.960
whether it's my energy. whether it's
my...everything to be on display.

25
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.080
Yeah. we're bringing out the whole
catalogue.

26
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.120
And thirdly. expect high knees
cos I think...

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.120
HE LAUGHS
..I think that!

28
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.560
I think that's part
and parcel of a Stormz show.

29
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600
I think that's almost synonymous.
like. with my shows now.

30
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.800
Like. the high energy and just...

31
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.160
..it's just. like. I don't know.
when that music hits.

32
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.280
it's just. I don't know.
it's electric. innit.

33
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.080
and this time round I've got three
albums and some change.

34
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.160
Yeah. we've got riddims. and I've
grown as well. I've grown a lot.

35
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.440
Yeah.

36
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.080
This is Stormzy. live in London.

37
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.080
This Is What We Mean.

38
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.560
CHEERING

39
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.880
# It's probably best we wait

40
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.160
# It's probably best we found

41
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.560
# A fire from this perfect match

42
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.800
# To burn us to the ground

43
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.240
# And even though it's cold outside

44
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.200
# It's probably best we pray

45
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.800
# To lead us from this drought

46
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.960
# If your love is my Holy Water

47
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.240
# Girl. just let me...
AUDIENCE:  ..drown

48
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.400
# I guess you got me figured out

49
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.560
# We got that champagne love.
don't let it fizzle out

50
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.080
# I know I brought a world of pain
you could've did without

51
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.520
# If you was livin' with me
then I'd probably get a bigger house

52
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.320
# And we standin' by the water.
do we drip or drown?

53
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.920
# Running 'round in circles bro.
just let her walk

54
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.160
# Listenin' to lessons.
that's a lesson taught

55
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.880
# Second guesses really got you
havin' second thoughts

56
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.360
# Second thoughts never hurt nobody.
everybody has 'em

57
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.720
# Give you orgasms

58
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.320
# More than you can fathom

59
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.560
# Think I missed the touch even
more than we imagined

60
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.880
# If I saw you right now. girl.
I wonder what would happen?

61
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.240
# Orange G-Wagon you can park
up on the drive

62
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.800
# I was meant to be there
when you're startin' up your life

63
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.400
# You make your people proud.
you're a star in all our eyes

64
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.720
# With your apartments in the skies

65
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.080
# I scarred you with my lies. then

66
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.520
# Karma isn't nice. she said
"I hope he doubles back on you"

67
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.920
# When I double back.
I never double back to rattle you

68
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.480
# Hate to see you leave
but I love to see the back of you

69
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.080
# I take you out to eat then after
that. I make a snack of you

70
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.560
# I never put my hand on you

71
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.720
# Still the biggest fan of you

72
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.000
# Good for me like collard greens
and runner beans and callaloo

73
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.320
# Every single day I close my eyes
and try and channel you

74
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.000
# Drive through memory lane
and then I see you by the avenue but

75
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.280
# It's probably best we wait

76
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.640

can I bless you with it?

# I ain't spillin' all my truth to
try and stress you with it

89

# I was workin' on my flaws to try
impress you with it

# And you don't believe the growth
but

91
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.000
# Yeah. I guess you're with it.
right?

92
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.160
# Cos fire
and fire just makes flames

93
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.760
# And water
and water just cause floods

you're tired of these games

# You said you're fine in your
calling. I call bluff

96

# And you ain't gotta lie
'bout the reasons as to why you left

# Just know the man I am today.
is not the guy you met

98

you need to give your mind a rest

# That's the least you deserve. too
deep for a verse. my weaknesses hurt

100

# If you ever change your mind
I beg you speak to me first

101

about the bees and the birds

word. word

I love you guys at the back too.

453

I'm sorry that I can't be closer. I
love you.

454
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.920
This is a special show. man.
This is a very. very special show.

455
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.120
This is the first time

456
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.720
since the album that I'm getting to
perform the full album -

457
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.800
This Is What I Mean.

458
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.040
This album for me reflects a very
specific time in my life.

459
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.160
A very.
very specific time in my life

460
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.240
where the word that always comes up
when I reflect back on this

461
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.160
time in my life is stillness.

462
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.800
I was very still.
I was still. I was at peace.

463
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.880
I was very reflective.

464
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.440
I was able to lay out
all my thoughts

465
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.040
and map out all my feelings.

466
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.520
And look myself in the mirror
and say. "OK. this is how you feel."

467
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.680
And that required a lot
of stillness. That required a lot of

468
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.440
reclusion. solitude -
whatever you want to call it.

469
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.800
But it was a beautiful thing.
It was a beautiful thing

470
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.960
to look at myself in the mirror and
say.

471
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.520
"OK. that is you - that's how you
truly feel."

472
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.240
I pray that. in this moment. even if

473
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.560
it's just for the next three
minutes.

474
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.920
that you experience just a little
bit of the stillness

475
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.560
and a little bit of the peace that
I felt when I made this album.

476
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.880
And I pray that some of you take
this stillness away

477
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.600
and you take it
for the rest of your lives.

478
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.240
Some of you may just feel it in this
moment. and that's OK. but...

479
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.480
..my prayer for everyone is that
they have a moment of stillness.

480
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.600
man. So that you can hear yourself
think.

481
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.600
so that you can hear yourself
breathe.

482
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.120
So that you can get just a little
bit of peace. you know?

483
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.480
This one's called
Give it to the Water.

# Over the years. we've been
ill-advised

1362
01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.920
# They told us "Just one at a
time." that's the biggest lie

1363
01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.120
# A wise man
once asked. "Who ate all the pies?"

my arm and leg to help you move

1371

# Didn't know we're tryna implement
our history through the schools
