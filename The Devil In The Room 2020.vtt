(Cameron hushes)

139
00:23:27.859 --> 00:23:29.130

Come here.

Yeah?
- Okay.

151
00:23:55.522 --> 00:23:56.605

152
00:23:58.282 --> 00:23:59.965
Awesome. I'll call the Dr.
Marsh on the way to work

and see what she can do. okay?

154
00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:05.234
It's okay. just breathe.

155
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.707
It's a nightmare.

156
00:24:12.353 --> 00:24:15.020
(ominous music)

157
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.123
- Hi. Doctor Morris?

158
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.453
- Please come in.

159
00:24:46.519 --> 00:24:47.527
You must be Amanda.

160
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.920
Cameron has told me so much about you.

161
00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.330
- [Amanda] All good things. I hope.

162
00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:01.303
- Of course.

163
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.800
Oh. you know that I used to babysit him

164
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.980
when he was a toddler.

165
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.040
- Really?
- (laughs) Yes.

166
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.900
Well. I'm so glad to see that he's landed

167
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.200
such a lovely young woman.

168
00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.510
So. Amanda. what brings you in here today?

169
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.860
- Well. I was hoping you could prescribe

170
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.880
me something to help me sleep.

171
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.910
- You must understand
it's not that simple.

172
00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.570
I'm gonna need to understand
what's been going on

173
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.590
before I know how to proceed.

174
00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.580
- Right.

175
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.610
Um. well. I haven't been
sleeping much lately.

176
00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.430
I've been having these nightmares.

177
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.645
But they're not like normal nightmares.

178
00:25:40.645 --> 00:25:43.270
That'd be fine. I could handle that.

179
00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:48.253
but these feel. I don't
know. they feel real.

180
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.370
- Real?

181
00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.530
- Yeah. I guess that's the
best way to describe it.

182
00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.190
It feels like when I'm there in the dream

183
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:58.540
it feels like something
could actually hurt me.

184
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.840
- What is it you think could hurt you?

185
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:07.530
- I don't know exactly how to describe it.

186
00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:12.083
but it feels like an evil presence.

187
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:15.840
- When did this start?

188
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.360
- A couple weeks ago.

189
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.223
- [Doctor] What was going on about then?

190
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:27.600
- Um I started having these nightmares

191
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.813
right after my sister killed herself.

192
00:26:31.487 --> 00:26:34.070
(doctor sighs)

193
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.930
- You're going through
a really traumatic time

194
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.580
and what you're experiencing
is completely normal

195
00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.433
and I do believe it'll get better.

196
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:51.150
That being said. I think I'll prescribe

197
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.850
something for you for the
anxiety that you're feeling.

198
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.560
Just take one of these before
you try to sleep at night.

199
00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.610
it should help you get the rest you need.

200
00:27:01.048 --> 00:27:01.881
(doctor sighs)

201
00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:03.908
And for the time being I'd like to see you

202
00:27:03.908 --> 00:27:06.076
about twice a week if that's possible.

203
00:27:06.076 --> 00:27:08.287
- Oh. I don't think
that's necessary. I think-

204
00:27:08.287 --> 00:27:09.581
- It may not be.

205
00:27:09.581 --> 00:27:14.581
but in my experience it's
better to talk these things out

206
00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.975
than to let them fester.

207
00:27:16.975 --> 00:27:20.225
(tea kettle whistling)

208
00:27:41.236 --> 00:27:43.486
(knocking)

209
00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:49.974
- Amanda Williams?

210
00:27:49.974 --> 00:27:51.440
- Yes.
- Sign here.

211
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.530
- I'm sorry. what is this?

212
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.550
- This luggage was lost in
a transit a few weeks ago.

213
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.129
This house was listed
as a forwarding address.

214
00:27:57.129 --> 00:27:57.962
- Okay.

215
00:27:59.694 --> 00:28:00.640
- You have a good night. ma'am.

216
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.473
- Thanks. you too.

217
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:07.364
(door clattering)

218
00:28:10.473 --> 00:28:13.390
(luggage rattling)

219
00:28:18.466 --> 00:28:21.216
(zipper buzzing)

220
00:28:26.985 --> 00:28:29.652
(Amanda laughs)

221
00:28:48.816 --> 00:28:51.566
(paper rustling)

222
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.113
- [Cameron] Hey!

223
00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.100
- Hey. you're home early.

224
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.990
- Yeah. we made some
really good progress today

225
00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.090
so I got to leave a little early.

226
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:03.943
What's that?

227
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.580
- Apparently some of Jenny's
stuff got forwarded here

228
00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.650
so I was just going through it.

229
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:10.483
- Huh.

230
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.323
That's cool.

231
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.873
- Yeah. apparently she had
problems sleeping. too.

232
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.490
- Uh. that's a little weird.

233
00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.240
- I mean. not really.

234
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.660
I mean. we were always pretty similar

235
00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.096
when it comes to this stuff.
especially when we were kids.

236
00:29:28.096 --> 00:29:30.230
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

237
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.063
- Okay.

238
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.680
Uh. so how was going and
talking to Doc Morris today?

239
00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.150
- Oh. it was awesome.

240
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.927
You were right. she's great.

241
00:29:39.927 --> 00:29:42.084
- Yeah. she's a super sweet lady.

242
00:29:42.084 --> 00:29:44.584
(light music)

243
00:29:47.946 --> 00:29:50.946
(suspenseful music)

244
00:30:11.674 --> 00:30:16.674
(light dramatic music)
(tapping)

245
00:30:39.225 --> 00:30:42.392
(dark dramatic music)

246
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.650
(dramatic music)

247
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:09.198
(Cameron gargling)

248
00:31:12.612 --> 00:31:15.529
(Cameron coughing)

249
00:31:21.768 --> 00:31:23.372
(Amanda gasps)
- Breathe. breathe. breathe.

250
00:31:23.372 --> 00:31:26.929
Okay. It's okay. it's
okay. it's okay. it's okay.

251
00:31:26.929 --> 00:31:28.641
I know. you're just having
another nightmare. okay?

252
00:31:28.641 --> 00:31:29.821
I couldn't wake you up.

253
00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:31.316
It's okay.
(heavy breathing)

254
00:31:31.316 --> 00:31:34.458
It's okay. it's okay.
- Sorry.

255
00:31:34.458 --> 00:31:35.291
It wasn't me this time.

256
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:36.731
it was you. I killed you.
- It's okay. it's okay.

257
00:31:36.731 --> 00:31:38.570
It was just a dream. it
was just a nightmare.

258
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:39.403
It's okay.

259
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.880
- I'm not taking those
fucking drugs again.

260
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.165
- Okay. that's fine.

261
00:31:44.165 --> 00:31:45.715
That's fine. that's fine. okay?

262
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.093
You know what? Come on.
let's get outta here.

263
00:31:48.093 --> 00:31:50.149
Let's get outta here and go.

264
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:55.149
(light dramatic music)
(heavy breathing)

265
00:32:06.263 --> 00:32:08.915
Okay. what do you...
what do you need or want?

266
00:32:08.915 --> 00:32:10.270
You want some tea?

267
00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.530
You want tea? Yeah.

268
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.503
We have tea. we have camomile around here.

269
00:32:15.973 --> 00:32:17.556
We got tea for you.

270
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.273
What happened?

271
00:32:20.273 --> 00:32:22.930
I thought that those pills were
supposed to help you relax.

272
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:26.713
- I thought so too. but it
was like I couldn't move.

273
00:32:26.713 --> 00:32:27.777
I was paralyzed.
- Oh my God.

274
00:32:27.777 --> 00:32:29.040
that's so fucked up.

275
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.630
Okay. we need you to go back to Dr. Morris

276
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.270
and I need to tell her
exactly what happened.

277
00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.900
- I don't know about that.
- No. I really think

278
00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.990
that you should because if
those pills aren't working

279
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:37.350
there has to be something stronger

280
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.320
that can help you sleep or...

281
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.420
Hey. regardless. I will stay up with you

282
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:43.970
as long as you need tonight. okay?

283
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:44.877
- No. you have to prepare for your test.

284
00:32:44.877 --> 00:32:47.050
- It's not like I can
go to sleep right now

285
00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.050
even if I wanted to.

286
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.097
Come here.

287
00:32:51.097 --> 00:32:51.930
Come here.

288
00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.360
You are the most important thing to me

289
00:32:57.268 --> 00:32:58.973
in the whole entire world. okay?

290
00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.752
Okay?
- Okay.

291
00:33:01.752 --> 00:33:04.343
- I will do anything that you need me to.

292
00:33:04.343 --> 00:33:06.530
- Okay.
- Okay?

293
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:07.363
- Thank you.

294
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.153
- I love you.

295
00:33:10.548 --> 00:33:11.892
- I love you. too.

296
00:33:11.892 --> 00:33:14.354
- [Cameron] You're gonna be okay.

297
00:33:14.354 --> 00:33:17.021
(ominous music)

298
00:33:30.869 --> 00:33:33.452
(bed creaking)

299
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:51.639
(light rhythmic music)

300
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.230
(keyboard clicking)

301
00:34:35.494 --> 00:34:38.244
(birds chirping)

302
00:34:41.727 --> 00:34:43.141
Morning.

303
00:34:43.141 --> 00:34:44.185
- Morning.

304
00:34:44.185 --> 00:34:46.450
- Did you get any sleep last night?

305
00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:47.647
(Amanda hums)

306
00:34:47.647 --> 00:34:48.480
Amanda.

307
00:34:49.376 --> 00:34:50.209
- I'm a little tired.

308
00:34:50.209 --> 00:34:52.821
- I know. that's not healthy.

309
00:34:52.821 --> 00:34:55.040
You gonna go back to Dr.
Morris today and get some meds?

310
00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:00.040
- Uh. yeah. I can go back.

311
00:35:00.263 --> 00:35:01.269
- Great.

312
00:35:01.269 --> 00:35:02.500
I. um...

313
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.943
I gotta go get ready for work.

314
00:35:04.943 --> 00:35:06.744
- I was gonna make
breakfast. did you want some?

315
00:35:06.744 --> 00:35:07.577
- No.
- I was gonna make some.

316
00:35:07.577 --> 00:35:09.987
- I wish I could. but I kind of overslept.

317
00:35:09.987 --> 00:35:13.406
There's a lot to do today
before I fly out tonight. so...

318
00:35:13.406 --> 00:35:14.666
- Okay.
(light dramatic music)

319
00:35:14.666 --> 00:35:16.360
Good luck tomorrow.

320
00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.193
- Thank you.

321
00:35:18.415 --> 00:35:19.740
If you need anything today
just give me a call. okay?

322
00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.518
- Okay. I will.

323
00:35:21.518 --> 00:35:22.351
I love you.

324
00:35:22.351 --> 00:35:23.851
- I love you. too.

325
00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.447
(ominous music)

326
00:35:52.351 --> 00:35:55.351
(suspenseful music)

327
00:36:16.052 --> 00:36:19.052
(suspenseful music)

328
00:36:33.889 --> 00:36:36.639
(dramatic music)

329
00:36:50.681 --> 00:36:53.431
(paper rustling)

330
00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.690
- [Amanda] Hi. Arnold Dubeaux?

331
00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:10.140
- Sorry. I'm not taking any
new clients at this time.

332
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.850
- [Amanda] But I've been
having these nightmares.

333
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:14.220
- Of course. we all have trouble
sleeping from time to time.

334
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.410
unfortunately I'm very
busy and I don't have

335
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.260
enough time to analyze
every stressed out insomniac

336
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.680
who comes to my door.

337
00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.010
- But I've been having these nightmares

338
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.450
and last night I had one that was so bad

339
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.660
I was paralyzed. I couldn't even move.

340
00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.940
- Yes. well you see. if
you'd look outside my door

341
00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:31.460
you'll see a signup sheet for
a sleep study at a hospital.

342
00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.293
Very good for you.

343
00:37:32.293 --> 00:37:33.630
- But that's not...

344
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:35.780
I don't have that kind
of sleeping problem.

345
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.620
I've been seeing this thing
whenever I try to sleep.

346
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.420
- You've been seeing this exact thing?

347
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.260
Come inside my office at once.

348
00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.240
Tell me all the information you can.

349
00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.490
Start from the beginning.

350
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.030
- And then last night
I had another nightmare

351
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.890
and the figure was there but it was like

352
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.377
I was paralyzed. it was
like I couldn't sleep.

353
00:38:02.377 --> 00:38:04.580
- Did you take a sleeping aid?

354
00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.580
- How did you know?

355
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.600
- I cannot express to you the importance

356
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:11.190
of not taking a sleeping aid of any kind.

357
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:13.750
- I don't know. I think it
was just the kind that I took.

358
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:16.830
I was gonna go back this
afternoon so I could get

359
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:18.503
a stronger prescription and-
- No.

360
00:38:18.503 --> 00:38:21.460
You introduce a substance into your system

361
00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.140
to deepen your sleep. it
will weaken your mind's

362
00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.530
natural ability to fight off the threat.

363
00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.280
And there's no telling how
severely it will infiltrate.

364
00:38:30.363 --> 00:38:32.723
- Uh. I'm sorry what is happening?

365
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.330
- These dreams. they feel real. right?

366
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:37.163
- Yes.

367
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:40.750
- Have you done any traveling
outside of the country?

368
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:42.070
- [Amanda] No.

369
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:42.903
- Really?

370
00:38:42.903 --> 00:38:44.460
Not at all?

371
00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.263
- I mean. my sister did.

372
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.020
- Is there anything that
you've come in contact

373
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.320
with recently that was
from a foreign country?

374
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:58.510
- My sister passed away
recently and she traveled a lot

375
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.020
and collected things and
now all of her things

376
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.550
are in my home.

377
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:03.590
- I thought as much.

378
00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:08.590
Um. was your sister
killed by her own hand?

379
00:39:09.406 --> 00:39:12.300
(light dramatic music)

380
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:15.300
I believe that she may have
experienced the same phenomenon.

381
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:20.070
It is possible that your
sister may have taken a litch.

382
00:39:21.453 --> 00:39:22.851
- A what?

383
00:39:22.851 --> 00:39:25.040
- A litch.

384
00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.673
An evil spirit that becomes
encapsulated in an object.

385
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:33.500
These spirits feed off
negativity of any sort.

386
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.430
be that fear. anxiety. guilt.
grief. depression. remorse.

387
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:39.460
You name it.

388
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:41.330
The stronger the negative energy.

389
00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:42.980
the more easily accessible the person

390
00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.240
becomes to that spirit.

391
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.060
If you're experiencing sleep paralysis

392
00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.300
it means the spirit already
has a strong hold over you.

393
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.890
Although it's not too late.

394
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.200
- Too late before what?

395
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.963
- Before the spirit kills the host.

396
00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.670
If you can figure out which
object holds the litch.

397
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:04.150
that is the only way to
break yourself from its hold.

398
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.163
Presuming that it's not too late.

399
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.643
Do you believe that you have anything

400
00:40:08.643 --> 00:40:09.833
like that in your home?

401
00:40:11.693 --> 00:40:12.526
- Yes.

402
00:40:17.303 --> 00:40:20.330
Okay. what do I need to do?

403
00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:22.180
Okay. I need to burn it for how long?

404
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.860
Okay. I'll burn it until
it's done and then...

405
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.230
Okay. I'll call you when it's done.

406
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.691
Bye.

407
00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:31.358
(fire rustling)

408
00:40:37.864 --> 00:40:40.947
(ghostly whispering)

409
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:52.163
- Hey. hey.

410
00:40:52.163 --> 00:40:53.310
What are you doing? Hey. hey. hey.

411
00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.143
What are you doing?

412
00:40:54.143 --> 00:40:56.200
Are you trying to light yourself on fire?

413
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.443
Come on. hey. come on. come on.

414
00:40:57.443 --> 00:40:58.410
We're going to Dr. Morris.

415
00:40:58.410 --> 00:40:59.784
Come on. come on.

416
00:40:59.784 --> 00:41:03.034
(light dramatic music)

417
00:41:11.454 --> 00:41:14.700
- Amanda. I have to know
what is so disturbing

418
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.220
about these dreams?

419
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.320
Is there anything
consistent in the dreams?

420
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.780
- Yeah.

421
00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.763
The evil thing.

422
00:41:24.511 --> 00:41:25.483
And my sister.

423
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.623
- Your sister is in the dreams?

424
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:31.793
What is she doing?

425
00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:36.943
- It's not what she's doing necessarily.

426
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:46.090
it's more so that she
blames me for her death.

427
00:41:48.107 --> 00:41:48.940
- Really?

428
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.173
Why is that do you think?

429
00:41:53.283 --> 00:41:54.533
- I don't know.

430
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:58.803
She called me.

431
00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:02.520
The night Jenny killed herself.

432
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.423
she called me and I didn't pick up.

433
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:10.600
- So one night out of the
blue your sister called you

434
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.150
and you didn't answer
because you were comfy in bed

435
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.560
and the next morning you found out

436
00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.630
that she'd killed herself.

437
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:22.100
- But there's nothing I can
do about that. I should've...

438
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.362
I should've just answered
the fucking phone.

439
00:42:24.362 --> 00:42:28.450
I could've talked her down.
I could've been able to...

440
00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:29.623
- It's not your fault.

441
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.690
You have to know that.
it's not your fault.

442
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:37.543
And feeling guilty is
not gonna bring her back.

443
00:42:41.163 --> 00:42:43.400
I'm glad you told me about this.

444
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.930
We can work on this.

445
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:47.453
and together we can help
you work through it.

446
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.830
But you can't let your fear of sleeping

447
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:56.773
stand in the way of your
health and wellbeing.

448
00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.420
You need to get a good
night's sleep tonight.

449
00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.583
that's the first step.

450
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.270
We'll work through the rest of it in time.

451
00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.620
Okay?

452
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.420
I'd like to prescribe
you something different.

453
00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.140
This should eliminate
dreaming of any sort.

454
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.260
It's designed to put you
into a deep peaceful sleep

455
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.760
and allow your brain to
reset the way it needs to.

456
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.853
Otherwise you risk hospitalization.

457
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.170
- No. Gubeaux said-

458
00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:28.630
- Did you say Gubeaux?

459
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.150
As in Arnold Gubeaux?

460
00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:37.413
Amanda. Arnold Gubeaux is not a scientist.

461
00:43:37.413 --> 00:43:41.260
His studies are not rooted
in any sort of fact.

462
00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:44.650
He has no data to speak
of. he's widely disregarded

463
00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.400
by the scientific community.

464
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.340
Your mind is in an
incredibly fragile state.

465
00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.120
It's very dangerous.

466
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.330
You'll begin to microsleep and
see things that aren't there

467
00:43:56.330 --> 00:43:59.793
to the point that you won't be
able to trust your own mind.

468
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:03.300
And if you continue down this path

469
00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:07.160
without sleeping for
too long. you will die.

470
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.960
As long as she takes the medication

471
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.980
within the next few hours
she should be able to sleep

472
00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.830
through the night and she'll wake up

473
00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.960
in the morning and she'll be fine.

474
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.310
It's only if she neglects to do this

475
00:44:19.310 --> 00:44:21.033
that we have any real danger.

476
00:44:33.382 --> 00:44:35.540
- Oh. do you mind if I
take this? It's Justin.

477
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.120
- It's fine. I'm gonna
go inside and change

478
00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.220
and get ready for bed.

479
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:42.400
- Hey. man.

480
00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.050
Yeah. thanks for calling me back.

481
00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:47.233
Listen. I'm gonna need to postpone.

482
00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.963
No. I'm just needed at home right now.

483
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:54.420
Yeah. we're all good.

484
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:55.253
Okay.

485
00:45:02.529 --> 00:45:03.687
(phone ringing)

486
00:45:03.687 --> 00:45:05.200
- Dude. stop calling me.

487
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.700
- Amanda. I'm trying to get ahold of you.

488
00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.120
After you burned the litch-

489
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.470
- Dude. seriously. you need to stop. okay?

490
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:11.670
Stop with the litch bullshit.

491
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.650
You're crazy. you need to leave me alone.

492
00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:14.483
- No. no. no.

493
00:45:14.483 --> 00:45:16.350
Hold on. if the spirit is interfering-

494
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:18.650
- Okay. seriously. you need to stop.

495
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:21.286
If you don't. I'm gonna call
the cops. I'm not joking.

496
00:45:21.286 --> 00:45:23.720
(light dramatic music)

497
00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.264
- Wait. what. what happened?

498
00:45:28.264 --> 00:45:29.320
What?

499
00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:33.240
- I... I don't know. I burned
it earlier and now it...

500
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.860
- You are in danger. so
just stay right there.

501
00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:41.803
I will be right over and whatever
you do. don't sleep. okay?

502
00:45:42.914 --> 00:45:43.747
- Hey.

503
00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.573
You okay?

504
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.753
- I just...

505
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:52.121
I'm just ready to sleep.

506
00:45:52.121 --> 00:45:53.710
- Okay. all right.

507
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.177
I'll prepare your sleeping pills.

508
00:45:55.177 --> 00:45:56.953
You gotta take one.

509
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:09.900
(light dramatic music)

510
00:46:13.131 --> 00:46:14.900
Is there anything else I can get you?

511
00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:16.160
- No. I'm good.

512
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.640
Um. how was Justin? What'd he need?

513
00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.490
- Nothing really.

514
00:46:21.883 --> 00:46:24.790
I told him I'm gonna
postpone taking the Bar.

515
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:25.750
- What?

516
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.811
No. you can't do that.
- Yes. I can.

517
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:29.185
And I will.

518
00:46:29.185 --> 00:46:30.540
Okay. there will be plenty
of other opportunities

519
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.240
for me to take the Bar.

520
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.700
- Yeah. but we're banking
on your firm bringing

521
00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.030
you on next month as an associate.

522
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:38.683
You can't just-
- Yes. I can.

523
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:40.600
Okay? It's gonna be fine.

524
00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.780
I'll just stay on as a
paralegal for another year

525
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.520
and I'll just reapply for
associate next year as well.

526
00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.550
I'll apply to other firms.

527
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:47.630
I'll figure it out. okay?

528
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:48.530
I promise I'll be fine.

529
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:49.740
- No. okay.

530
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.130
Listen.

531
00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:53.110
I love you and it means the world to me

532
00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:56.060
that you would stay here
with me but we can't...

533
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:57.790
I can't let you miss out on this. okay?

534
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:58.765
You have to go.

535
00:46:58.765 --> 00:47:00.251
- No. I don't.

536
00:47:00.251 --> 00:47:01.168
I can stay.

537
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.463
- No. you need to go. okay?

538
00:47:06.463 --> 00:47:08.610
I'm just gonna be staying here.

539
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:09.960
I'm just gonna be sleeping. okay?

540
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.983
There's nothing here for you to do.

541
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:17.970
- Okay.

542
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:19.060
If you're absolutely sure.

543

544
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.593
I'm sure.

545
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.020
But wait. what time is your flight?

546
00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:26.350
Aren't you supposed to
be out of here by now?

547
00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:27.900
- I was supposed to be
out of here 15 minutes ago

548
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.750
but I think I can make it if I hurry.

549
00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:37.273
Hey.

550
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:40.740

- Hi.
(ominous music)

580
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:41.790
- What's going on? I...

581
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:43.193
- How'd you let this happen?

582
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:46.480
- What?

583
00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.533
- I needed you.

584
00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:51.230
- I didn't...

585
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:52.320
I didn't know that. I didn't think-

586
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.983
- You were being selfish.

587
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.583
All you had to do was answer the phone.

588
00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:00.970
- If you just listen to me-

589
00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:02.743
- You weren't there for me.

590
00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.560
- You're right and I'm sorry.

591
00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.773
I should've been there.

592
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:16.387
I wish... I wish I could go
back in time and fix things.

593
00:56:16.387 --> 00:56:20.100
but I can't. and that's
something I'm gonna have

594
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.153
to deal with for the rest of my life.

595
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.150
But you can't keep using
my sister like this.

596
00:56:30.683 --> 00:56:32.523
And I need you to leave me alone.
