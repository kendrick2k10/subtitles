00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:02.884
ON APRIL 26. 1986. REACTOR NO. 4
OF THE CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

4
00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:05.217
SUFFERED A CATASTROPHIC EXPLOSION.

5
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.925
CAUSING ONE OF THE LARGEST MAN-MADE
DISASTERS IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.

6
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.842
THIS FILM IS INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS.

7
00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:22.675
THE FILM'S CHARACTERS AND THEIR
LIFE STORIES ARE FICTIONAL.

8
00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:49.509
-Thank you.
-I'll get you the change.

9
00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:51.009
-No. keep it.
-Thank you.

10
00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.592
-Come with me.
-I'm busy.

11
00:01:54.675 --> 00:01:58.092
-Some firemen came in. Pick one.
-This is not a dating agency.

12
00:01:58.175 --> 00:01:59.509
You need a man.

13
00:01:59.592 --> 00:02:02.009
-No. I don't.
-You do. more than anyone.

14
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.259
There they are.

15
00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:21.175
I have to go home.

16
00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:23.759
But there's a huge line
of customers waiting outside.

17
00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:32.217
-I'm sorry. I have to go.
-Girls. are you on strike or something?

18
00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:34.092
Come on in.

19
00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:36.092
-Where do I sit?
-Over there.

20
00:02:58.092 --> 00:02:59.300
Hello. Alex.

21
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800
Hello. Olga.

22
00:03:02.842 --> 00:03:04.467
Have you two met before?

23
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:09.509
More than ten years ago.

24
00:03:12.717 --> 00:03:14.800
Just don't cut both my ears off. okay?

25
00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:16.759
One will do.

26
00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.384
I thought you were in Kiev.

27
00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:30.925
And I thought you were in Kiev. too.

28
00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:36.259
-You haven't changed.
-Liar.

29
00:04:04.884 --> 00:04:05.884
ENTRANCE

30
00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:10.217
Olga…

31
00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.717
Come ride with me. for old times' sake.

32
00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:16.509
Just like that?

33
00:04:16.592 --> 00:04:19.467
I could send a formal request.
but it might take until winter.

34
00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.050
-Come back in three weeks for a trim.
-Olga. the bus is coming.

35
00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.967
Move over. granny.

36
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.092
Dressed up like dollar prostitutes.

37
00:04:53.175 --> 00:04:55.009
That's exactly what we are.

38
00:04:56.092 --> 00:04:57.175
Jesus.

39
00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:10.884
Close your legs. you're not at work.

40
00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.925
What's your problem?
Most women would kill for a man like that.

41
00:05:37.425 --> 00:05:38.884
Open the door!

42
00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:44.050
Sorry about that. everyone.

43
00:05:45.092 --> 00:05:46.342
Olga.

44
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.592
Come with me or these
passengers will be stuck here all day.

45
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.134
Miss. you're holding us up.

46
00:06:03.884 --> 00:06:05.884
-Bye. everyone.
-Good riddance.

47
00:06:31.675 --> 00:06:33.134
Well. what do you want?

48
00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:36.342
Nothing.

49
00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:49.300
I want to hug you.

50
00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:55.925
Go on then.

51
00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:27.925
Like a couple of pensioners.

52
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.300
Hi. Olga.

53
00:07:32.134 --> 00:07:33.092
Hi. Alex.

54
00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:42.300
Come on. where do you want to go?

55
00:07:43.134 --> 00:07:46.134
You pulled me off the bus.
so let's hear your suggestions.

56
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.634
Let's go to a restaurant?
Or how about we head into Kiev?

57
00:07:52.925 --> 00:07:56.884
Remember when we had no money.
we shared one ice cream between us?

58
00:07:58.467 --> 00:08:02.134
-Got it. We need an ice cream.
-Two ice creams.

59
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.884
Excuse me. I'm in a terrible rush.

60
00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:16.092
-How many?
-Two. Nice hair. by the way.

61
00:08:16.175 --> 00:08:18.342
ICE CREAM

62
00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:20.134
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

63
00:08:25.092 --> 00:08:26.925
Let's go for a ride on the Ferris wheel?

64
00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:29.009
It won't be open until May Day.

65
00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:32.967
My buddies from the local fire station
did the safety inspection on it.

66
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.967
We can get a private test ride.

67
00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:39.967
-You're just as crazy as when you were 20.
-Who. me? Not at all.

68
00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.550
This is far enough. Stop here.

69
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:39.967
Thanks for the ride.

70
00:10:01.092 --> 00:10:02.842
It was a nice evening. thank you.

71
00:10:03.717 --> 00:10:05.467
What about the cake we bought?

72
00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:09.634
Pulling out your nuclear weapon?

73
00:10:10.175 --> 00:10:12.009
Atomic power to the masses.

74
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.134
I'll pass.

75
00:10:24.842 --> 00:10:27.300
Olga! Wait.

76
00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:29.925
Alex. some other time. okay?

77
00:10:31.884 --> 00:10:33.592
Greetings. fellas! What's the occasion?

78
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:36.467
Celebrating Soviet technical prowess.

79
00:10:37.384 --> 00:10:39.467
You got a husband in there or something?

80
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.925
No. why?

81
00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:47.050
I promise. no funny business.

82
00:10:47.134 --> 00:10:49.050
I just don't want to say goodbye yet.

83
00:10:51.175 --> 00:10:53.217
I haven't had such a good time in ages.

84
00:10:54.467 --> 00:10:57.092
But you have
a different life now. and so do I.

85
00:10:57.967 --> 00:11:00.425
We can see each other
at the hair salon sometimes.

86
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.675
Olga. my hair grows too slowly.

87
00:11:04.467 --> 00:11:05.300
Bye.

88
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.717
I'm home. How's it going?

89
00:11:23.342 --> 00:11:24.634
I don't like this school.

90
00:11:25.592 --> 00:11:27.175
You'll make friends soon.

91
00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:29.342
They're all scientists' kids.

92
00:11:29.425 --> 00:11:30.509
little smartasses.

93
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:34.425
Olga?

94
00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:37.550
Olga. I forgot to give you the cake.

95
00:11:38.634 --> 00:11:40.467
-Olga?
-Stop shouting and go away.

96
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.884
If you're ashamed
of your apartment. I live in a dorm.

97
00:11:42.967 --> 00:11:43.884
Go away.

98
00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:53.092
This is my son. Alex.

99
00:11:53.175 --> 00:11:54.342
Alex. this is uncle Alexey.

100
00:11:54.425 --> 00:11:55.925
Please be acquainted.

101
00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:58.259
Come in.

102
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.050
Are you sure this is a good time?

103
00:12:02.134 --> 00:12:03.092
Come in.

104
00:12:07.217 --> 00:12:09.134
-Howdy. namesake.
-Hello.

105
00:12:11.675 --> 00:12:14.134
You two boys chat here
while I go and change.

106
00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:18.884
Who are you?

107
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:26.009
Who am I? I'm… a sun keeper.

108
00:12:26.092 --> 00:12:27.259
How's that?

109
00:12:27.342 --> 00:12:28.675
Well. for 200.000 years.

110
00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:30.884
people ran around naked
with sticks and stones.

111
00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:33.217
and then we built
our own sun. and I look after it.

112
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.050
I see. Everyone here works at the reactor.

113
00:12:36.134 --> 00:12:38.509
But only the best
work in the fire service.

114
00:12:40.384 --> 00:12:43.717
-But that's not working at the reactor.
-Ever heard of fire inspections?

115
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.884
I've been
over every inch of all four reactors.

116
00:12:45.967 --> 00:12:47.759
and fixed lots of problems.

117
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.384
-What do you have in here?
-Photos of our neighbors.

118
00:12:55.134 --> 00:12:57.300
These ones I know.

119
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.842
But who's this? Is he from Kazakhstan?

120
00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:02.759
That's Jackie Chan. he's from Hong Kong.

121
00:13:02.842 --> 00:13:04.509
He's even tougher than Bruce Lee.

122
00:13:06.175 --> 00:13:09.592
-You're into filmmaking?
-This camera isn't good for that.

123
00:13:09.675 --> 00:13:11.259
It was my grandpa's.

124
00:13:15.842 --> 00:13:17.592
You boys got to know each other?

125
00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.342
Can I have a word with you?

126
00:13:33.342 --> 00:13:34.342
How old is he?

127
00:13:35.009 --> 00:13:35.842
He's ten.

128
00:13:38.134 --> 00:13:39.300
Whose is he?

129
00:13:41.134 --> 00:13:42.300
He's mine.

130
00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:13.842
Why didn't you tell me?

131
00:14:18.009 --> 00:14:20.425
How could I tell you
if I didn't even know where you were?

132
00:14:28.425 --> 00:14:31.134
-How's the cake?
-It conforms to state standards.

133
00:14:33.092 --> 00:14:34.592
I'll have a slice. too. then.

134
00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:51.425
Should we tell him?

135
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.217
No need to tell him anything.

136
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.342
Eat your cake.

137
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:25.550
Right.

138
00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.592
What date is tomorrow?
The 12th? I have a day off.

139
00:15:28.675 --> 00:15:30.550
We're all going to Kiev for the day.

140
00:15:30.634 --> 00:15:33.134
I'll be here at 9:00 a.m..
and I'm bringing presents.

141
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.134
And then we'll have dinner
all together at home.

142
00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:39.634
All right?

143
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.092
-Bye.
-I'm working tomorrow.

144
00:15:47.134 --> 00:15:48.675
Can't you get a day off?

145
00:15:52.675 --> 00:15:54.592
I guess I can switch with Marina.

146
00:15:55.175 --> 00:15:56.217
With Marina…

147
00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.634
Perfect. It's a date then.

148
00:16:01.925 --> 00:16:03.384
See you at 9:00 a.m. Sharp.

149
00:16:04.259 --> 00:16:05.717
I'll see myself out.

150
00:16:06.342 --> 00:16:07.217
Bye. Alex.

151
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.217
TWO WEEKS LATER

152
00:16:40.092 --> 00:16:42.050
What can I say. my dear friends.

153
00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:47.884
It is with a heavy heart that I leave you.

154
00:16:47.967 --> 00:16:49.342
I gave you everything I have.

155
00:16:50.884 --> 00:16:56.759
My youth. wisdom. health. beauty.
and my hope for a better future.

156
00:16:57.925 --> 00:16:59.967
-Attention!
-As you were.

157
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.342
You still owe me ten rubles.

158
00:17:01.425 --> 00:17:03.634
A materialist like you
can't be trusted with money.

159
00:17:03.717 --> 00:17:06.759
I'd give it back.
but you'll spend it on a soldering iron.

160
00:17:11.009 --> 00:17:12.592
What will you do without me?

161
00:17:13.175 --> 00:17:15.259
We'll finally put things in order.

162
00:17:15.342 --> 00:17:18.675
We know the drill. Comrade Colonel.
First breakfast. then lunch. then dinner.

163
00:17:19.467 --> 00:17:22.384
It's a solid foundation
for everything else.

164
00:17:22.467 --> 00:17:23.884
unlike your flimsy structure.

165
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.925
Well. guys. keep your hoses dry.

166
00:17:39.467 --> 00:17:40.884
Go ahead. I'm ready.

167
00:17:54.925 --> 00:17:56.425
Do it!

168
00:18:10.259 --> 00:18:11.425
Alex!

169
00:18:15.384 --> 00:18:17.092
Come here. you!

170
00:18:49.384 --> 00:18:51.300
You have no respect for your elders.

171
00:18:53.259 --> 00:18:54.384
Is this Valery?

172
00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:56.842
Yep. my baby brother.

173
00:18:56.925 --> 00:18:59.717
-He's got a PhD. works at the reactor.
-Sergey. cut it out.

174
00:19:01.759 --> 00:19:03.009
Nice to meet you. Alexey.

175
00:19:03.634 --> 00:19:04.759
Likewise.

176
00:19:08.967 --> 00:19:10.092
Here it is.

177
00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:14.509
-Where's the box?
-What box? It's second-hand.

178
00:19:15.384 --> 00:19:17.717
You always need
to keep hold of the packaging.

179
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.884
Let's see.

180
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.217
Here. 500.

181
00:19:23.217 --> 00:19:25.467
-Count it.
-I'll take your word for it.

182
00:19:26.842 --> 00:19:29.050
Here's the camera.
In a box. as it should be.

183
00:19:29.842 --> 00:19:32.342
-I gave it a good cleaning.
-Much appreciated.

184
00:19:32.425 --> 00:19:34.467
And here's the manual.

185
00:19:38.675 --> 00:19:41.759
-Here's a bag.
-Handy.

186
00:19:44.925 --> 00:19:48.425
You're a good firefighter.
You should've stayed on.

187
00:19:48.509 --> 00:19:51.717
I'm just fed up wandering
around corridors checking stuff.

188
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.634
That's part of the job. What do you want?

189
00:19:53.717 --> 00:19:55.592
I want to see Alla Pugacheva in concert.

190
00:19:57.175 --> 00:20:00.634
-She'll come here one day.
-So sit here and wait for her then.

191
00:20:00.717 --> 00:20:03.134
Valery. come
and join us in the dormitory later.

192
00:20:03.217 --> 00:20:06.175
I'm having a farewell party.
It'll be fun. See you then.

193
00:20:07.717 --> 00:20:09.384
See you later. Sergey.

194
00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:20.217
Are you coming or not?

195
00:20:41.967 --> 00:20:45.175
-But this is not Chanel.
-I'm not the Czechoslovakian ambassador.

196
00:20:53.842 --> 00:20:55.675
Bring it back in 24 hours.

197
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.925
-But you said two days.
-And you said Chanel.

198
00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:02.009
You're breaking my heart.

199
00:21:10.217 --> 00:21:12.967
THE PARTY PLANS. WE MAKE IT HAPPEN

200
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.259
WALL OF HONOR

201
00:21:39.842 --> 00:21:45.842
CHERNOBYL NPP

202
00:22:38.509 --> 00:22:40.634
Alex!

203
00:22:46.925 --> 00:22:49.009
-Hey.
-Hi.

204
00:22:52.217 --> 00:22:54.467
I brought you a present. Here.

205
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.259
-What is it?
-A proper film camera.

206
00:22:58.384 --> 00:23:00.300
-No way. Really?
-Yes way. silly.

207
00:23:01.134 --> 00:23:02.384
It's a Lomo.

208
00:23:03.134 --> 00:23:05.842
-How did you get it?
-With a bit of perseverance.

209
00:23:06.467 --> 00:23:07.384
Wow.

210
00:23:08.592 --> 00:23:09.550
Thank you.

211
00:23:10.592 --> 00:23:12.175
Mom and I were waiting for you.

212
00:23:14.717 --> 00:23:17.550
Sorry. I got caught up with work.

213
00:23:20.759 --> 00:23:21.717
And here's the manual.

214
00:23:23.467 --> 00:23:24.592
Here.

215
00:23:27.009 --> 00:23:28.467
What should I tell Mom?

216
00:23:35.092 --> 00:23:37.217
Just tell her
that Father Christmas came early.

217
00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:48.384
See you later.

218
00:24:22.884 --> 00:24:24.550
I remember fire at the third reactor.

219
00:24:24.634 --> 00:24:27.800
We were all sweating like pigs.
could hardly keep hold of our hoses.

220
00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:31.384
Well. Alex stripped down
to his briefs. put his sunglasses on.

221
00:24:31.467 --> 00:24:34.175
and started wetting
the dry wall with buckets of water.

222
00:24:34.259 --> 00:24:35.259
A rainbow above him.

223
00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:40.509
All for Elena from HR.
who was watching him from her window.

224
00:24:41.634 --> 00:24:43.092
You're making stuff up.

225
00:24:43.175 --> 00:24:45.800
The whole brigade got a bonus.
and Alex was demoted to captain.

226
00:24:49.175 --> 00:24:50.967
Alex. I envy you. in a good way.

227
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.592
I envy your freedom
and your willful heart.

228
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.259
You're fearless. you do
as you please. and you answer to nobody.

229
00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:04.300
Well. keep your hose dry. buddy.

230
00:25:05.092 --> 00:25:06.509
-Hurrah!
-Hurrah!

231
00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:09.384
Thanks. Sergey.

232
00:25:21.342 --> 00:25:23.342
-Slow down. Alex.
-I'll be fine.

233
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.717
Was that a made-up story?

234
00:25:37.675 --> 00:25:39.134
I'll be right back.

235
00:25:53.467 --> 00:25:55.884
-Why aren't you eating?
-I'll eat later.

236
00:25:58.884 --> 00:26:01.759
-Stop filming me.
-Stop stopping me.

237
00:26:05.259 --> 00:26:06.842
You'll have to give the camera back.

238
00:26:06.925 --> 00:26:08.550
But. Mom. it's a gift.

239
00:26:11.509 --> 00:26:12.675
I'll get it.

240
00:26:16.134 --> 00:26:17.467
It's Father Christmas!

241
00:26:18.342 --> 00:26:20.884
Alex! What's up?

242
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:28.050
Damn it. Alex. look at you!

243
00:26:28.134 --> 00:26:30.800
What a little man? Just look at you.

244
00:26:30.884 --> 00:26:32.717
I just can't…

245
00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:34.592
Are you drunk?

246
00:26:36.675 --> 00:26:38.259
I'm drunk with love.

247
00:26:40.634 --> 00:26:41.925
Go play outside.

248
00:26:46.342 --> 00:26:49.259
Mom. can Uncle Alexey stay for dinner?

249
00:26:49.342 --> 00:26:51.759
That's none of your business. Go outside.

250
00:26:53.134 --> 00:26:54.134
Not fair.

251
00:27:00.509 --> 00:27:02.384
May I come in?

252
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.134
Fried potatoes!

253
00:27:36.717 --> 00:27:37.925
Olga. please. I'm sorry.

254
00:27:39.634 --> 00:27:42.467
I got very sick. so sick…

255
00:27:44.259 --> 00:27:45.967
I was at death's door.

256
00:27:47.175 --> 00:27:48.884
Did some nurse save you?

257
00:27:57.675 --> 00:27:59.092
I'm moving to Kiev.

258
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.842
I can't take it here anymore.

259
00:28:01.925 --> 00:28:04.717
I'm a top expert.
and I have nothing to do here.

260
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.134
-Come with me.
-Stop it.

261
00:28:07.134 --> 00:28:08.050
Olga…

262
00:28:09.217 --> 00:28:10.342
come with me.

263
00:28:12.259 --> 00:28:15.800
I'll buy Alex a water pistol.
and we'll put fires out together.

264
00:28:17.634 --> 00:28:20.134
We were waiting
for you that day. I made dinner.

265
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.592
I lied to my colleagues.

266
00:28:28.134 --> 00:28:29.800
I said I don't want to work here.

267
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.259
that I want to leave.

268
00:28:32.342 --> 00:28:33.425
But the truth is…

269
00:28:34.967 --> 00:28:36.050
I just want to be with you.

270
00:28:38.634 --> 00:28:40.800
I don't want to hear any of it.

271
00:28:40.884 --> 00:28:44.342
No. I made up my mind. Really.

272
00:28:46.675 --> 00:28:48.800
I want a family with you.

273
00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.759
It's not going to work between us.

274
00:28:55.675 --> 00:28:56.675
Go on your own.

275
00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.759
Stop talking nonsense.

276
00:29:02.425 --> 00:29:03.675
Let's go together.

277
00:29:04.384 --> 00:29:07.967
We'll rent a place for a while.
and then apply to get our own apartment.

278
00:29:09.467 --> 00:29:11.175
We're not going anywhere with you.

279
00:29:12.134 --> 00:29:13.259
Leave us alone.

280
00:29:15.342 --> 00:29:17.592
Are you telling me to abandon Alex?

281
00:29:19.175 --> 00:29:21.509
We've been fine without you all this time.

282
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.009
Listen. I'm really going to leave.

283
00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.759
and that'll be it.

284
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:07.384
Forever.

285
00:30:10.592 --> 00:30:13.259
Just make sure
this time you leave for good.

286
00:30:26.092 --> 00:30:26.925
Fine.

287
00:30:28.134 --> 00:30:29.634
Good luck with your life.

288
00:30:37.717 --> 00:30:43.300
Leave.

289
00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:13.342
This is the best spot!
We can see everything from here!

290
00:31:24.717 --> 00:31:26.092
Let's get closer!

291
00:31:30.967 --> 00:31:32.592
Get the camera.

292
00:31:44.217 --> 00:31:46.717
It's too dark
for your camera to record anything.

293
00:31:58.092 --> 00:32:01.509
Our folks will kill us when they find out
we lied about going night fishing.

294
00:32:02.092 --> 00:32:03.384
How would they find out?

295
00:32:04.134 --> 00:32:05.425
We go every week.

296
00:32:07.967 --> 00:32:10.259
-How is it. Alex?
-We need to get closer.

297
00:32:34.384 --> 00:32:35.842
Let's get out of here.

298
00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.550
Shoot.

299
00:33:03.634 --> 00:33:05.009
Wait for me!

300
00:33:12.717 --> 00:33:14.967
Wait for me! Damn it!

301
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.259
Wait for me!

302
00:33:24.884 --> 00:33:26.342
Wait!

303
00:33:53.175 --> 00:33:54.467
It's no use.

304
00:33:58.634 --> 00:34:01.925
-Why are you all up at 5:00 a.m.?
-They took all our men away.

305
00:34:02.009 --> 00:34:04.800
-And where were you? Out boozing?
-What happened?

306
00:34:04.884 --> 00:34:08.092
-There's a fire at the station.
-And they disconnected the phones.

307
00:34:10.259 --> 00:34:13.550
Damn it. Just when I got
a transfer out of here…

308
00:35:37.842 --> 00:35:40.175
Stop!

309
00:35:42.925 --> 00:35:45.509
Guys. I need a lift. I'm a fireman.

310
00:35:45.592 --> 00:35:46.884
Got a spare uniform for me?

311
00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:00.842
Hey. brother. is that the reactor?

312
00:36:01.467 --> 00:36:03.634
The pride and joy of the Soviet Union.

313
00:36:03.717 --> 00:36:06.717
Are you from around here?
Do you know why the forest has gone brown?

314
00:37:01.842 --> 00:37:04.925
-Move it!
-Go!

315
00:37:08.342 --> 00:37:10.384
Sir. I need to join my team!

316
00:37:10.467 --> 00:37:11.884
-Are you local?
-Yes. sir.

317
00:37:11.967 --> 00:37:13.842
I think your guys
are over on the other side.

318
00:37:13.925 --> 00:37:14.884
Come on!

319
00:37:16.884 --> 00:37:20.634
Get one more hose over there! Hurry!

320
00:37:30.425 --> 00:37:31.509
Tigran?

321
00:37:31.592 --> 00:37:33.550
Pour the water here!

322
00:37:33.634 --> 00:37:34.467
Tigran?

323
00:37:37.092 --> 00:37:38.509
Tigran?

324
00:37:38.592 --> 00:37:41.384
Tigran… where are our guys?

325
00:37:42.342 --> 00:37:44.009
They're over there.

326
00:37:45.509 --> 00:37:48.384
We were here first. The fire's over there.

327
00:37:52.009 --> 00:37:53.800
More water!

328
00:37:54.759 --> 00:37:56.592
Why are you not with the others?

329
00:37:56.675 --> 00:37:59.759
They told me to go up on the roof.

330
00:37:59.842 --> 00:38:01.425
The light was something unreal.

331
00:38:01.509 --> 00:38:05.509
I looked right into it.
It's unreal. like it's alive.

332
00:38:07.675 --> 00:38:09.009
You're not making any sense.

333
00:38:10.467 --> 00:38:12.092
The reactor exploded.

334
00:38:15.634 --> 00:38:17.925
Are you crazy? How could it explode?

335
00:38:37.717 --> 00:38:39.259
Tigran.

336
00:38:42.759 --> 00:38:44.675
Hang on. buddy.

337
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.259
Over here! Hurry!

338
00:38:53.675 --> 00:38:56.592
-We have a severe case!
-Over here!

339
00:39:06.634 --> 00:39:08.509
Iodine thyroid block. now!

340
00:39:31.967 --> 00:39:35.050
-Careful.
-And lift.

341
00:39:35.134 --> 00:39:36.967
Into the ambulance. quick!

342
00:39:51.967 --> 00:39:53.217
Yuri!

343
00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.092
Get down here!

344
00:40:20.092 --> 00:40:23.134
Hang on. buddy.

345
00:40:23.842 --> 00:40:24.884
Lie still.

346
00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:29.175
PRIPYAT

347
00:40:31.342 --> 00:40:34.967
Don't get up. Help's on its way.

348
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:37.800
-Yuri. get down here!
-Sergey!

349
00:40:38.634 --> 00:40:41.009
Alex. we've got to go up.

350
00:40:41.675 --> 00:40:43.675
Yuri's still on the roof.
Let's go get him.

351
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.842
Hey. give me your breather.

352
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.175
Sergey. you okay?

353
00:41:15.967 --> 00:41:18.259
Up there. the bitumen's on fire.

354
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:26.300
Stay here. I'll be back in a minute.

355
00:41:58.967 --> 00:42:01.675
Yuri! Where are you? Yuri!

356
00:42:12.384 --> 00:42:14.884
Yuri. Get up.

357
00:42:17.884 --> 00:42:19.342
My face is all burned. right?

358
00:42:24.134 --> 00:42:27.175
Get up. Come on. get up!

359
00:42:29.675 --> 00:42:35.009
I got you. Now let's get out
of here. Come on. Let's go.

360
00:42:41.717 --> 00:42:43.175
Come on. get up.

361
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.509
Come on.

362
00:43:07.592 --> 00:43:10.092
Sergey. you okay?

363
00:43:12.134 --> 00:43:14.634
I'm fine.

364
00:43:15.425 --> 00:43:16.342
You two go.

365
00:43:41.384 --> 00:43:43.884
Medic! Now!

366
00:44:05.425 --> 00:44:11.550
Sergey. I'm here. Come on. get up.

367
00:44:11.634 --> 00:44:15.050
Breathe. Sergey. breathe!

368
00:44:17.675 --> 00:44:19.925
Over here! Hurry!

369
00:44:24.134 --> 00:44:27.259
Boys. we have orders
to extract all the severe cases!

370
00:44:27.342 --> 00:44:28.550
Who's been vomiting?

371
00:44:29.717 --> 00:44:32.342
We picked men up from the third entrance--

372
00:44:32.425 --> 00:44:34.509
Load them in! You get in.

373
00:44:34.592 --> 00:44:37.300
Third entrance. Lots of them.

374
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.675
I have to get them to hospital.

375
00:44:40.759 --> 00:44:43.009
Luda. hurry up.

376
00:44:43.092 --> 00:44:47.800
Luda. hurry up. I have to get them
to hospital. There are more. a lot more.

377
00:44:48.509 --> 00:44:50.634
-Take me with you.
-No. we're full!

378
00:44:50.717 --> 00:44:53.342
-They are my guys.
-There's no room!

379
00:44:53.425 --> 00:44:55.717
Please take me with you.

380
00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.759
I have my orders.
only severe cases. Let's go!

381
00:44:58.842 --> 00:45:01.175
-Need to get them to the hospital--
-Start the engine!

382
00:45:01.259 --> 00:45:03.050
Take me with you.

383
00:45:04.342 --> 00:45:05.759
Start the engine!

384
00:45:16.842 --> 00:45:18.717
-Can you drive? Let's go!
-Yes.

385
00:45:21.884 --> 00:45:23.342
-But--
-Move over!

386
00:45:49.967 --> 00:45:51.134
He's not breathing.

387
00:45:53.384 --> 00:45:55.009
Keep going! Don't stop!

388
00:46:00.259 --> 00:46:01.717
Everything's completely swollen up.

389
00:46:06.592 --> 00:46:07.967
Hold his head straight.

390
00:46:22.467 --> 00:46:23.800
Keep it steady!

391
00:46:47.925 --> 00:46:49.300
How is he?

392
00:46:51.092 --> 00:46:52.259
He's breathing.

393
00:46:54.092 --> 00:46:56.134
Go. Go!

394
00:47:03.509 --> 00:47:04.925
Careful!

395
00:47:11.509 --> 00:47:12.759
Get up.

396
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.425
Put him in ward three!

397
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.384
-Where to?
-Ward three is full.

398
00:47:38.467 --> 00:47:39.925
Don't just stand there. Move on.

399
00:47:50.342 --> 00:47:51.925
Kristina. get supplies ready.

400
00:47:52.009 --> 00:47:53.884
-Give this one a shot.
-Take your clothes off.

401
00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:58.800
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

402
00:48:33.384 --> 00:48:35.175
Kristina. diazepam.

403
00:48:35.259 --> 00:48:38.134
-What's that?
-A sedative to calm you down.

404
00:48:38.217 --> 00:48:40.925
-Put him in ward two.
-It's full.

405
00:48:41.009 --> 00:48:42.717
-Ward four then.
-No space there. either.

406
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:44.634
There's one now.
Shinkarenko didn't make it.

407
00:48:45.634 --> 00:48:47.092
They just took him out.

408
00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.342
This way.

409
00:49:09.384 --> 00:49:10.634
Hurry up with the sheets.

410
00:49:12.134 --> 00:49:13.675
Go. I'll finish here.

411
00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:15.675
Lie down.

412
00:49:50.134 --> 00:49:53.425
Alexey. wake up.

413
00:49:56.675 --> 00:49:57.884
Alexey. wake up.

414
00:49:58.634 --> 00:49:59.634
Alexey?

415
00:50:00.384 --> 00:50:02.217
Get up. Are you Alexey Karpushin?

416
00:50:05.092 --> 00:50:05.925
Yes.

417
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.925
How long was I asleep?

418
00:50:08.009 --> 00:50:09.967
Quite a while.
They overdid it with the sedative.

419
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:15.384
Do you feel nauseous?

420
00:50:18.134 --> 00:50:20.175
-I don't think so.
-Are you feeling okay?

421
00:50:23.342 --> 00:50:24.175
Yes.

422
00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:33.884
Good. Very well then.

423
00:50:35.175 --> 00:50:37.925
Alexey. my name is Dina.
I'm a radiologist from Kiev.

424
00:50:38.009 --> 00:50:40.717
We came here to see you.
They'll bring you new clothes.

425
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.425
I'll wait in the corridor
while you get dressed.

426
00:50:56.217 --> 00:50:57.842
-Nikolai?
-Go away.

427
00:50:58.842 --> 00:50:59.759
Go away!

428
00:51:01.509 --> 00:51:03.925
Nikolai!

429
00:51:04.884 --> 00:51:06.175
Nikolai!

430
00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:13.967
-Go away. go home!
-Please step away from the window.

431
00:51:14.717 --> 00:51:16.175
You could get us in trouble.

432
00:51:17.634 --> 00:51:19.634
Alexey Prihodko?

433
00:51:22.967 --> 00:51:25.050
-Why can't they come in?
-You're contaminated.

434
00:51:25.134 --> 00:51:26.384
What are we contaminated with?

435
00:51:30.384 --> 00:51:32.800
Radiation. You all
react differently to it.

436
00:51:32.884 --> 00:51:34.884
Some die after five minutes of exposure.

437
00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:37.050
Some are fine after five hours.

438
00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:39.800
You got lucky. you only got 14 rem.

439
00:51:48.009 --> 00:51:50.050
All the contaminated clothes
go into the basement.

440
00:51:50.134 --> 00:51:53.759
All of you who just arrived.
leave your clothes by the entrance!

441
00:51:55.384 --> 00:51:57.884
-Here's Karpushin.
-Hold on a minute.

442
00:51:59.342 --> 00:52:00.717
Are you Alexey Karpushin?

443
00:52:01.425 --> 00:52:02.550
Yes. hello.

444
00:52:02.634 --> 00:52:05.550
-From the reactor fire service?
-Chief of watch. sixth brigade.

445
00:52:05.634 --> 00:52:08.134
-Do you know the corridors below?
-Like the back of my hand.

446
00:52:08.217 --> 00:52:09.717
Have you ever scuba dived?

447
00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.509
No. only snorkeled.

448
00:52:12.134 --> 00:52:14.800
I see. You're coming with us.

449
00:52:14.884 --> 00:52:17.342
Look. I left the service here
and got a transfer to Kiev.

450
00:52:20.134 --> 00:52:24.092
You're coming with us.
and we'll discuss your transfer later.

451
00:52:24.175 --> 00:52:26.342
Close the door and wait.
I'll be with you shortly.

452
00:52:28.634 --> 00:52:30.009
Doctor. you can stay.

453
00:52:32.259 --> 00:52:33.384
Yes. hello?

454
00:53:06.009 --> 00:53:07.384
The kids are all outdoors.

455
00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.925
Comrade Stysin. we can start now.

456
00:53:31.009 --> 00:53:33.509
Hello. Comrade Karpushin.
I'm Mikhail. this is Ivan.

457
00:53:33.592 --> 00:53:36.300
We're with a government commission
responding to the incident.

458
00:53:36.384 --> 00:53:38.425
Hi. Valery. Any news about Sergey?

459
00:53:38.509 --> 00:53:40.592
They took him to Kiev. he's in bad shape.

460
00:53:42.842 --> 00:53:45.717
Comrades. I apologize for
bringing you all here with no explanation.

461
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:48.092
I shall explain now.
Ivan. please turn on the video.

462
00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:05.842
Between the third and fourth units
is the crater left by the explosion.

463
00:54:05.925 --> 00:54:08.342
The reactor core
is in a sub-critical condition.

464
00:54:08.425 --> 00:54:11.425
All these bright spots
are clumps of burning reactor fuel.

465
00:54:12.092 --> 00:54:14.134
Temperatures could increase to the point

466
00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:17.467
where it melts through the floor
of the reactor and the concrete below.

467
00:54:18.425 --> 00:54:22.675
The coolant water reservoirs
are directly underneath the reactor.

468
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:27.384
As you know. if enough fuel
burns through and gets to the water.

469
00:54:27.467 --> 00:54:29.092
there will be a steam explosion…

470
00:54:29.675 --> 00:54:32.509
that will cause
further ejection of radioactive material.

471
00:54:35.259 --> 00:54:37.384
If the core reaches the reservoirs.

472
00:54:37.467 --> 00:54:41.467
Kiev. Moscow… and the whole
of Europe will be contaminated.

473
00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:50.217
So we must get the water out of there.

474
00:54:51.967 --> 00:54:53.884
Your departments have staff

475
00:54:53.967 --> 00:54:56.675
who are familiar with
the corridors beneath the reactor.

476
00:54:56.759 --> 00:55:00.425
Comrade Kostenko. water management.
Comrade Maksimov. electrical service.

477
00:55:00.509 --> 00:55:03.967
Valery Goncharuk. cooling systems.
and Comrade Karpushin. fire service.

478
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.550
Colonel Bobylin
will be assisting with the operation.

479
00:55:12.092 --> 00:55:14.550
We need you
to recommend staff from your departments

480
00:55:14.634 --> 00:55:18.259
who know the corridors under the reactor
well enough to open the sluice gates.

481
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:21.300
How do you intend to do that

482
00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:23.884
if the water management block
is destroyed?

483
00:55:23.967 --> 00:55:25.967
The control panel is under rubble.

484
00:55:27.175 --> 00:55:29.259
We can go through
the pipe conduit corridor

485
00:55:29.342 --> 00:55:31.467
and open the drainage valve manually.

486
00:55:41.259 --> 00:55:43.092
But it's all flooded with hot water.

487
00:55:44.675 --> 00:55:48.842
People will be working in diving gear.
and get diving instruction beforehand.

488
00:55:50.259 --> 00:55:53.550
If the servo is flooded. it'll take half
an hour to open the valve by hand.

489
00:55:53.634 --> 00:55:57.300
Two people working together can do it
in under eight minutes. we were assured.

490
00:55:57.384 --> 00:56:02.300
You want us to volunteer our own people
and send them to boil for eight minutes?

491
00:56:04.425 --> 00:56:07.050
The volunteers will be rewarded.

492
00:56:07.884 --> 00:56:12.217
We're also getting a plane ready
to take them to Switzerland for treatment

493
00:56:12.342 --> 00:56:15.009
in a specialist radiation clinic.

494
00:56:15.092 --> 00:56:16.675
The most outstanding volunteers

495
00:56:16.759 --> 00:56:19.009
will be awarded
private apartments in Moscow.

496
00:56:19.592 --> 00:56:22.717
The General Secretary
will see to it personally.

497
00:56:23.675 --> 00:56:24.634
Isn't that enough?

498
00:57:04.217 --> 00:57:06.217
Well. if the servo motor isn't flooded.

499
00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:08.092
can we power it up directly?

500
00:57:12.217 --> 00:57:15.800
You'll need the nearest junction box.
in case there are breaks in the cables.

501
00:57:16.592 --> 00:57:19.425
One closest to the motor is here.
I don't know how to get to it.

502
00:57:19.509 --> 00:57:22.134
We only go down there
once a year. with guides.

503
00:57:22.217 --> 00:57:23.884
Ivan. where's the map of the corridors?

504
00:57:28.717 --> 00:57:31.967
This is what we know about
the radiation levels down there.

505
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:35.384
The levels
in the corridors on the western side

506
00:57:35.467 --> 00:57:37.759
are lower than in the conduit corridors.

507
00:57:38.342 --> 00:57:40.467
and there should be less water.

508
00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:42.884
There are too many unknowns.

509
00:57:42.967 --> 00:57:44.550
What if the servo is flooded?

510
00:57:44.634 --> 00:57:48.259
So. you'd rather send inexperienced
divers to work in murky water?

511
00:57:49.175 --> 00:57:51.009
Can you guarantee
that your plan will work?

512
00:57:53.634 --> 00:57:54.467
No.

513
00:57:54.550 --> 00:57:57.592
But everyone
who stays down there long enough

514
00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.925
is guaranteed to be exposed.

515
00:58:00.009 --> 00:58:01.717
We won't stay long down there.

516
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.759
The water temperature is 56C. bearable.

517
00:58:03.842 --> 00:58:06.467
And we only have 100 meters to go.

518
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:08.092
Give us people who can show us

519
00:58:08.175 --> 00:58:10.634
what valves to turn.
then they can go straight back out.

520
00:58:12.467 --> 00:58:14.509
It'd be safest to go via Level 7.

521
00:58:15.092 --> 00:58:17.884
By the time we're done
wandering around this labyrinth.

522
00:58:17.967 --> 00:58:23.175
the water temperature will hit 70C.
and no one will go swimming in that.

523
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.800
Comrade Stysin.
can we go and see the pool now?

524
00:58:33.884 --> 00:58:36.842
Yes. of course. Let's go.

525
00:58:51.384 --> 00:58:52.800
Nikita. let's hear it.

526
00:58:52.884 --> 00:58:56.842
We stayed under for 12 minutes.
but the temperature right now is only 51C.

527
00:58:56.925 --> 00:58:59.009
We'll now increase it to 56C.

528
00:58:59.092 --> 00:59:01.717
As you were. As you can see.
we're preparing thoroughly.

529
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:05.842
But without your help.
we won't know which valve to open.

530
00:59:05.925 --> 00:59:08.759
There are miles of pipes in murky water.

531
00:59:08.842 --> 00:59:10.384
We won't have a clue what to do.

532
00:59:10.467 --> 00:59:12.092
Have you ever dived in hot water before?

533
00:59:13.925 --> 00:59:15.967
We know about extreme temperatures.

534
00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.050
We're talking hot. dirty water
in a confined space.

535
00:59:18.134 --> 00:59:19.509
not in a clean swimming pool.

536
00:59:19.592 --> 00:59:21.634
Engineers aren't trained
for such conditions.

537
00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:25.634
We'll train them here… in the pool.

538
00:59:26.509 --> 00:59:28.884
You'll give your own guys
hyperthermia right here.

539
00:59:28.967 --> 00:59:31.009
and none of them
will even make it to the reactor.

540
00:59:34.092 --> 00:59:37.259
I can't order my people
to do something like this.

541
00:59:37.342 --> 00:59:38.425
They're not soldiers.

542
00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:42.300
Comrades. this is not
a question of can or can't.

543
00:59:43.717 --> 00:59:46.884
It is a question of do or die.

544
00:59:59.509 --> 01:00:02.759
I'm sorry. but my men
don't know those corridors well enough.

545
01:00:02.842 --> 01:00:05.675
No electricity in the station.
not enough people. like you said.

546
01:00:09.467 --> 01:00:13.134
I can't order my men to do this either.

547
01:00:15.509 --> 01:00:17.259
If you decide to go in at Level 7…

548
01:00:19.634 --> 01:00:20.717
I'll go myself.

549
01:00:23.092 --> 01:00:24.259
Me too.

550
01:00:31.925 --> 01:00:35.509
Boris… we'll go in at Level 7.

551
01:00:36.884 --> 01:00:39.175
We have no right
to risk these people's lives.

552
01:00:46.967 --> 01:00:49.800
Do we have the right
to risk the lives of people in Kiev

553
01:00:49.884 --> 01:00:52.384
who are getting ready
for the May Day parade?

554
01:00:59.592 --> 01:01:00.592
Fine.

555
01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:06.217
Try going in… at Level 7.

556
01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:22.092
Do we have
the support of the fire service?

557
01:01:23.884 --> 01:01:27.467
I don't work here as of yesterday.
I don't have any authority to give orders.

558
01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:31.592
In any case. almost
the entire local brigade is hospitalized.

559
01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.384
I won't go in there.

560
01:01:41.259 --> 01:01:47.259
Didn't you give an oath to protect
your country with your own life?

561
01:01:56.384 --> 01:01:58.800
Fine. let's decide on the route.

562
01:02:23.425 --> 01:02:28.050
Attention. everyone.

563
01:02:28.134 --> 01:02:30.675
Dear comrades.

564
01:02:30.759 --> 01:02:35.425
the City Council
of People's Deputies informs you that.

565
01:02:35.509 --> 01:02:38.009
due to an incident

566
01:02:38.092 --> 01:02:43.134
at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

567
01:02:43.217 --> 01:02:46.342
there is an adverse radioactive situation

568
01:02:46.425 --> 01:02:49.425
in the town of Pripyat.

569
01:02:49.509 --> 01:02:53.259
Authorities and the military

570
01:02:53.342 --> 01:02:58.134
are taking all necessary measures.

571
01:02:58.884 --> 01:03:04.675
Nonetheless. in order
to ensure safety of the townspeople.

572
01:03:04.759 --> 01:03:07.925
children being top priority.

573
01:03:08.009 --> 01:03:12.509
we need to temporarily evacuate civilians…

574
01:03:15.634 --> 01:03:18.217
Olga!

575
01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:22.300
-Olga!
-Alex got very sick.

576
01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:24.675
-Hey there. Jackie Chan.
-Hi.

577
01:03:26.842 --> 01:03:28.134
What's wrong with him?

578
01:03:28.217 --> 01:03:31.134
Same as with everyone.
I don't know. We have to get out of here.

579
01:03:33.967 --> 01:03:35.300
Have the doctors seen him?

580
01:03:35.884 --> 01:03:39.217
No. The hospital is packed full
of sick kids. all screaming and crying.

581
01:03:39.925 --> 01:03:41.592
There's talk of a wave of miscarriages.

582
01:03:41.675 --> 01:03:43.134
Miscarriages. understand?

583
01:03:43.675 --> 01:03:45.800
The police have cordoned off the hospital.

584
01:03:50.342 --> 01:03:52.550
Hey. how are you feeling?

585
01:03:53.509 --> 01:03:55.800
I saw the explosion and then a glow.

586
01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.092
Did anyone get killed?

587
01:03:58.175 --> 01:04:00.634
No. it was just an ordinary fire--

588
01:04:00.717 --> 01:04:01.842
Are you my dad?

589
01:04:07.259 --> 01:04:08.884
No. Why do you ask?

590
01:04:21.259 --> 01:04:22.717
Did Mom tell you that?

591
01:04:23.467 --> 01:04:26.259
We'll talk about this later.
We need to go now.

592
01:04:27.509 --> 01:04:28.675
Come on. get up.

593
01:04:28.759 --> 01:04:30.134
You're not a little kid.

594
01:04:30.217 --> 01:04:32.425
I'm not going anywhere.

595
01:04:32.509 --> 01:04:33.592
We have to go.

596
01:04:34.217 --> 01:04:35.342
Come on.

597
01:04:35.425 --> 01:04:37.217
We're never coming back here. right?

598
01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.300
Of course. we'll come back.

599
01:04:40.759 --> 01:04:43.134
You're lying!

600
01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:44.550
-Grab our bag.
-I want my camera!

601
01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.925
I'm not going anywhere! I don't want to!

602
01:04:50.717 --> 01:04:51.884
I'm not going!

603
01:05:01.675 --> 01:05:02.634
Olga. let me help.

604
01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:07.050
No animals allowed.

605
01:05:07.134 --> 01:05:10.884
-You can't take animals with you.
-But it's my dog! Dad. tell him!

606
01:05:11.842 --> 01:05:14.092
Sweetie. we'll come back for him later.

607
01:05:15.050 --> 01:05:17.259
-Give me the key.
-Don't lock him inside.

608
01:05:17.342 --> 01:05:19.634
-We have a sick child.
-The doctors are over there.

609
01:05:19.717 --> 01:05:20.842
Olga. follow me.

610
01:05:23.009 --> 01:05:24.342
Come.

611
01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:30.050
-Olga. over here.
-Alex…

612
01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:39.175
Olga. there's an ambulance.

613
01:05:43.509 --> 01:05:45.717
Sorry. it's an emergency.

614
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.259
-My child is sick. please help.
-Let's see his throat.

615
01:05:50.259 --> 01:05:52.717
-Has he been vomiting?
-He vomited yesterday.

616
01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:56.175
Everyone with radiation sickness
must go to Hospital No. 6 in Kiev.

617
01:05:56.259 --> 01:05:58.259
He can't even stand. We need an ambulance.

618
01:05:58.342 --> 01:06:00.259
You'll have to discuss that in Kiev.

619
01:06:00.342 --> 01:06:01.967
He can hardly breathe!

620
01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:03.884
What's your name. please?

621
01:06:06.759 --> 01:06:08.717
Olga Savostina. My son is Alexey Savostin.

622
01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:13.134
-Can I talk to you?
-Hands off me.

623
01:06:13.217 --> 01:06:14.300
Just for a second.

624
01:06:14.384 --> 01:06:16.675
Hands off me.
Can't you see what's going on here?

625
01:06:16.759 --> 01:06:20.092
Everyone's leaving town on buses.
I don't make decisions here. Name?

626
01:06:21.384 --> 01:06:22.217
Alexey Savostin.

627
01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.675
Savostin.

628
01:06:23.759 --> 01:06:24.717
Get on the bus.

629
01:06:25.342 --> 01:06:26.175
Let's go.

630
01:07:10.717 --> 01:07:13.259
Mom. I want out of the bus.

631
01:07:13.842 --> 01:07:15.467
Hang in there. sweetie.

632
01:07:16.259 --> 01:07:19.300
-Mom…
-Everything will be fine.

633
01:07:26.134 --> 01:07:30.134
Oh. God. what's happening?

634
01:07:31.717 --> 01:07:36.259
We'll be in Kiev soon.
we'll get help there. Don't worry.

635
01:07:36.342 --> 01:07:37.175
Stop it.

636
01:07:37.925 --> 01:07:39.384
Stop promising.

637
01:07:40.217 --> 01:07:41.300
Who's going to help us?

638
01:07:41.384 --> 01:07:43.467
They're transporting us
like cattle. Stop lying!

639
01:07:45.467 --> 01:07:47.259
I'm not lying. I'm trying to help.

640
01:07:48.425 --> 01:07:51.884
-I owe you that much.
-You don't owe us anything. Nothing!

641
01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:55.175
Mom. why are you yelling at him?

642
01:07:57.967 --> 01:08:00.759
I'm sorry.

643
01:08:04.009 --> 01:08:05.759
I just can't take it anymore.

644
01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:33.759
Take this. it's almost 300 rubles.

645
01:08:34.425 --> 01:08:36.425
I'll arrange
the best treatment there is for Alex.

646
01:08:36.509 --> 01:08:38.134
but now I have to go back.

647
01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:44.592
Hang in there. buddy.
You'll be good as new in no time.

648
01:10:00.342 --> 01:10:01.175
You in charge here?

649
01:10:01.259 --> 01:10:03.592
This man says he wants to volunteer.

650
01:10:03.675 --> 01:10:05.259
something about pumping water.

651
01:10:05.342 --> 01:10:08.050
-Alexey Karpushin. fire service.
-I know you. I was at the meeting.

652
01:10:08.134 --> 01:10:09.092
I want to volunteer.

653
01:10:11.467 --> 01:10:12.884
Oleg. talk to Frolov for me.

654
01:10:15.050 --> 01:10:17.134
Thanks. Captain. we'll take it from here.

655
01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:20.550
You just missed them. they went off
to the third reactor to check the route.

656
01:10:20.634 --> 01:10:23.050
You can go with the second group

657
01:10:23.134 --> 01:10:24.967
if the first group fails.

658
01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:26.634
How can I join the first group?

659
01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.592
-Comrade Stysin calls shots here.
-I know the corridors better than anyone.

660
01:10:30.675 --> 01:10:33.800
All right. Wait for them here.
They'll be back in a couple of hours.

661
01:10:33.884 --> 01:10:35.217
Can I join them there now?

662
01:10:35.967 --> 01:10:37.342
They'll be back soon.

663
01:10:39.384 --> 01:10:41.884
-Show me the route they decided on.
-On the board.

664
01:10:41.967 --> 01:10:43.175
-This one?
-Yes.

665
01:10:43.259 --> 01:10:46.759
I can't understand these blueprints.
Do you have a fire evacuation diagram?

666
01:10:47.884 --> 01:10:49.050
To the left.

667
01:10:56.509 --> 01:10:58.175
-Like that. through Level 7?
-Yes.

668
01:11:00.592 --> 01:11:04.009
We can cut through here. it's closer.

669
01:11:05.884 --> 01:11:08.925
-Cut through reinforced concrete?
-There used to be a flight of stairs.

670
01:11:09.009 --> 01:11:11.842
They took it out
and covered the hole with a metal sheet.

671
01:11:11.925 --> 01:11:12.800
Where?

672
01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.759
-Here?
-Yes.

673
01:11:15.842 --> 01:11:17.175
Why didn't they mention it?

674
01:11:17.259 --> 01:11:20.175
They've been here since the launch.
but I saw the plant being built.

675
01:11:20.259 --> 01:11:22.509
Take me there.
I'll show you the shortest way.

676
01:11:23.759 --> 01:11:26.300
Marchenko… get us a helicopter.

677
01:12:44.634 --> 01:12:46.925
Comrade Stysin. there's a shorter route.

678
01:12:47.009 --> 01:12:47.842
Show us.

679
01:12:47.925 --> 01:12:49.342
-Hi. Valery.
-Hi.

680
01:12:56.342 --> 01:12:57.175
Here it is.

681
01:12:57.842 --> 01:13:01.009
We can cut through it
and shorten the route.

682
01:13:04.342 --> 01:13:07.550
I did the calculations already.
this route is 150 meters shorter.

683
01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:10.217
Why isn't this in the blueprints?

684
01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:12.217
The blueprints
are verified. but in reality.

685
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.384
a lot of things were built differently

686
01:13:14.467 --> 01:13:15.759
to meet deadlines.

687
01:13:16.634 --> 01:13:17.967
Good news for us. though.

688
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:21.175
Comrade Stysin.
we won't be taking the fireman with us.

689
01:13:21.259 --> 01:13:26.175
We appreciate the tour. but down there
in the dark. we'll need reliable people.

690
01:13:33.925 --> 01:13:35.592
You'll come with the first group.

691
01:13:39.009 --> 01:13:42.217
-Are you doing this for the reward?
-What are you doing this for?

692
01:13:44.509 --> 01:13:46.092
I'm doing my duty.

693
01:13:54.967 --> 01:13:58.050
Are you Olga Savostina?
You have a phone call from Pripyat.

694
01:14:15.509 --> 01:14:16.550
-Hello?
-Olga…

695
01:14:17.259 --> 01:14:19.675
I found you at last. How are things?

696
01:14:19.759 --> 01:14:23.384
I don't know. They took Alex away.
They're not telling me how he is.

697
01:14:23.467 --> 01:14:24.384
He'll be fine.

698
01:14:24.467 --> 01:14:27.009
I'm making arrangements
for the best treatment for him.

699
01:14:27.092 --> 01:14:29.384
and then we'll all go live by the sea.

700
01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:33.509
-Olga?
-I can't talk to you anymore.

701
01:14:33.592 --> 01:14:36.300
-Olga? Hello?
-I'm sorry. I just can't.

702
01:14:36.384 --> 01:14:37.759
Olga. hello?

703
01:14:49.634 --> 01:14:52.550
-Comrade Stysin. I have a favor to ask.
-Go ahead.

704
01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:55.592
My son was exposed to radiation.

705
01:14:56.217 --> 01:14:58.342
Can he go to Switzerland. too?

706
01:15:01.425 --> 01:15:02.425
Comrade Tropin.

707
01:15:03.509 --> 01:15:07.925
Alexey has some conditions he'd like
to discuss before going under the reactor.

708
01:15:09.675 --> 01:15:13.175
-What conditions?
-No conditions. just a favor to ask.

709
01:15:16.759 --> 01:15:19.050
My son was near
the reactor when it exploded.

710
01:15:20.634 --> 01:15:23.675
Would it be possible for him to go
to Switzerland for treatment. too?

711
01:15:24.509 --> 01:15:28.425
The passenger list will be
confirmed by the General Secretary.

712
01:15:28.509 --> 01:15:30.425
and only liquidators are on it.

713
01:15:30.509 --> 01:15:33.425
Surely. it's easier for him
to add a name to a list

714
01:15:33.509 --> 01:15:35.717
than to evacuate the whole of Kiev?

715
01:15:36.759 --> 01:15:40.800
You don't quite understand
how the bureaucratic machine works.

716
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:43.717
Then can he go instead of me?

717
01:15:44.217 --> 01:15:47.925
And you can send me to a hospital
in Moscow or Kiev. Could that be done?

718
01:15:49.884 --> 01:15:52.050
I think we can arrange for that.

719
01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:55.800
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

720
01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:58.009
Would you mind
showing me your credentials?

721
01:15:59.175 --> 01:16:00.425
So that I can be sure.

722
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:13.925
I'm convinced.

723
01:16:16.217 --> 01:16:17.300
You should be.

724
01:16:27.425 --> 01:16:28.634
Here are your masks.

725
01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:31.300
The water shouldn't be deep.
but take them just in case.

726
01:16:32.217 --> 01:16:35.134
If you run into
a field of radiation. go around it.

727
01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:37.550
-We'll manage.
-Ivan. let's hear the drill again.

728
01:16:37.634 --> 01:16:39.675
You get to mark 01. cut through the floor

729
01:16:39.759 --> 01:16:42.259
and go along DU-1
to the junction box that powers the servo.

730
01:16:42.342 --> 01:16:44.134
You hook up the cable and wait.

731
01:16:44.217 --> 01:16:47.134
We'll power it up in exactly 20 minutes.
Let's synchronize watches.

732
01:16:49.925 --> 01:16:51.592
Alexey. I found out about Alex.

733
01:16:51.675 --> 01:16:53.925
The boy
was definitely exposed to radiation.

734
01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:57.509
but with treatment in Switzerland.
he should make a full recovery.

735
01:16:57.592 --> 01:16:58.717
Thank you.

736
01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:02.092
Just do what you have to do.
and we'll take care of the rest.

737
01:17:02.967 --> 01:17:05.467
-Time for you to go.
-Let's roll.

738
01:17:07.259 --> 01:17:08.800
Nikita. let's go.

739
01:17:42.384 --> 01:17:43.800
What force are you with?

740
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:46.342
Foreign intelligence.

741
01:17:46.425 --> 01:17:49.550
Holy cow! Do we have
a lot of enemies out there?

742
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.425
Your bosses are a bit harsh.

743
01:17:53.509 --> 01:17:55.342
They are okay. Keep hold of the reel.

744
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:57.800
We're here.

745
01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.092
This is where we need to cut.

746
01:18:22.884 --> 01:18:23.717
How is it?

747
01:18:27.259 --> 01:18:28.259
Could be worse.

748
01:18:30.384 --> 01:18:32.384
Let's go. The stairs
are only two meters away.

749
01:19:22.384 --> 01:19:24.925
There can't be any steam
in the pipes after the accident.

750
01:19:25.009 --> 01:19:26.259
So. what's this then?

751
01:19:26.342 --> 01:19:29.675
Water must be getting in
somewhere from above and evaporating.

752
01:19:29.759 --> 01:19:31.550
The reactor is still hot as hell.

753
01:19:41.259 --> 01:19:43.217
Alex. let's close these valves!

754
01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.384
Okay.

755
01:19:46.009 --> 01:19:47.425
Nikita. go for it.

756
01:19:58.259 --> 01:19:59.592
Nikita. get away from there!

757
01:20:07.425 --> 01:20:08.509
Let's get him up.

758
01:20:10.259 --> 01:20:11.550
Sit him down.

759
01:20:18.092 --> 01:20:21.175
-You need to get out.
-I'll go on. Boris.

760
01:20:24.175 --> 01:20:26.259
No. wait for us here. We'll be quick.

761
01:20:26.884 --> 01:20:28.634
I'm fine to continue.

762
01:20:28.717 --> 01:20:31.967
Don't be stupid.
Wait here. We'll be back soon.

763
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:35.425
Nikita. we'll be back soon.

764
01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:41.175
And lift.

765
01:21:01.925 --> 01:21:03.092
What's wrong. Valery?

766
01:21:07.092 --> 01:21:08.675
I'm not going any further.

767
01:21:39.550 --> 01:21:41.675
I'm sorry. I'm not going any further.

768
01:21:44.425 --> 01:21:46.342
But we can't do it without you.

769
01:21:46.425 --> 01:21:47.509
I can't go on.

770
01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:53.467
Let's talk. shall we?

771
01:21:57.675 --> 01:22:00.509
Get your breath back.
and then we'll have a little talk.

772
01:22:05.634 --> 01:22:07.675
I can't go on!

773
01:22:07.759 --> 01:22:10.634
My wife and kids in Kiev
are preparing to celebrate May Day.

774
01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:12.759
so stick your "can't go on" up your ass.

775
01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:17.842
-I'm sorry.
-Valery.

776
01:22:17.925 --> 01:22:19.800
-I'm sorry.
-You're having a panic attack.

777
01:22:19.884 --> 01:22:21.467
-Let go of me.
-Look me in the eyes.

778
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:22.592
I said let go of me!

779
01:22:22.675 --> 01:22:26.759
-I'm not going!
-Look at me. Breathe with me.

780
01:22:26.842 --> 01:22:27.759
In and out.

781
01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:29.342
Come on. breathe.

782
01:22:30.717 --> 01:22:33.759
In and out.

783
01:22:34.467 --> 01:22:37.425
That's it. calm down.

784
01:22:42.717 --> 01:22:44.259
Do you think I'm not scared?

785
01:22:44.925 --> 01:22:47.884
Do you think Yuri Gagarin wasn't scared
when they shot him into space?

786
01:22:47.967 --> 01:22:49.842
He pissed himself inside that spacesuit.

787
01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:56.009
When we're done here. they'll take us
for a lap of honor around Red Square.

788
01:22:56.759 --> 01:22:58.800
Like they did with Korolev and Gagarin.

789
01:22:59.550 --> 01:23:01.384
You know how many women Gagarin had?

790
01:23:02.884 --> 01:23:05.300
-No.
-More than you. that's for sure.

791
01:23:08.675 --> 01:23:09.925
You're an idiot. Alex.

792
01:23:16.509 --> 01:23:18.634
Sergey died in Kiev of radiation sickness.

793
01:23:46.634 --> 01:23:48.925
Well. Valery.
I am not going to die just yet.

794
01:23:50.509 --> 01:23:55.092
I still have plans… and dreams.

795
01:23:57.925 --> 01:24:00.175
Do you think
I'm not scared of going in there?

796
01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:13.759
My legs won't move.

797
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.592
Well. you just make them.

798
01:24:16.675 --> 01:24:19.300
Come on. up you go.

799
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.134
It's like a sauna in here.

800
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:07.217
-Crap!
-Is the cable in one piece?

801
01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.509
Looks like it. but the reel fell down.

802
01:25:15.134 --> 01:25:16.217
I feel dizzy.

803
01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.800
How many fingers am I holding up?

804
01:25:17.884 --> 01:25:20.009
Five. I think I might throw up.

805
01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:39.259
Help me out.

806
01:25:39.342 --> 01:25:40.634
I got you.

807
01:25:46.717 --> 01:25:48.467
Boris. it's scalding hot in there.

808
01:25:55.967 --> 01:25:57.092
You okay?

809
01:26:01.717 --> 01:26:02.842
We have six minutes.

810
01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.675
-Valery. get my flashlight.
-Okay.

811
01:26:07.634 --> 01:26:08.509
Give.

812
01:26:21.759 --> 01:26:23.217
There's the junction box.

813
01:26:28.217 --> 01:26:29.675
It's hot. but bearable.

814
01:26:29.759 --> 01:26:31.967
This water
makes you feel as if you're drunk.

815
01:26:37.342 --> 01:26:39.342
Boris. you stay here
and keep track of the time.

816
01:26:40.384 --> 01:26:42.384
I'll carry Valery
over to the junction box.

817
01:26:42.467 --> 01:26:44.217
and he'll hook the cable up.

818
01:26:44.967 --> 01:26:46.384
You remember the instructions?

819
01:26:46.925 --> 01:26:47.842
I do.

820
01:26:49.509 --> 01:26:50.759
Will you manage?

821
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:53.384
Yes.

822
01:26:57.592 --> 01:26:58.467
Three minutes.

823
01:27:32.925 --> 01:27:34.175
Ninety seconds. Valery!

824
01:27:51.342 --> 01:27:53.217
Right. Disconnecting the breaker.

825
01:27:53.884 --> 01:27:54.800
Done.

826
01:27:57.217 --> 01:27:58.134
You okay?

827
01:27:58.925 --> 01:28:00.092
Yeah. keep at it.

828
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:08.009
Connecting the cable
to the lower contacts of the breaker.

829
01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:09.884
One minute!

830
01:28:14.467 --> 01:28:15.759
One…

831
01:28:17.425 --> 01:28:18.675
and two.

832
01:28:22.092 --> 01:28:23.509
Connecting the breaker.

833
01:28:29.759 --> 01:28:31.175
Turning on the switch.

834
01:28:32.634 --> 01:28:35.175
-Thirty-two.
-I'm done. let's go back.

835
01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:45.050
Don't carry me. I'll walk.

836
01:28:48.342 --> 01:28:49.384
Come on.

837
01:29:14.384 --> 01:29:15.634
It worked!

838
01:29:16.467 --> 01:29:17.675
Holy crap!

839
01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:21.467
-We did it!
-Quiet.

840
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:23.675
-The tester's lit up.
-Quiet. We should hear it.

841
01:29:27.509 --> 01:29:30.092
Yes! It worked!

842
01:29:30.925 --> 01:29:33.634
We did it! It worked!

843
01:29:34.342 --> 01:29:36.759
Comrade Colonel. it worked! We did it!

844
01:29:39.092 --> 01:29:40.342
We did it!

845
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:55.717
It didn't work.
We'll have to open the valve by hand.

846
01:29:56.967 --> 01:29:58.467
Maybe we can try hotwiring it again?

847
01:29:58.550 --> 01:30:01.675
No. they already
powered it up. It didn't work.

848
01:30:01.759 --> 01:30:05.217
-Maybe the live came loose?
-That's not the problem.

849
01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.509
-Let's check the live--
-That's not the problem. Alex!

850
01:30:09.342 --> 01:30:11.425
We'll have to open the valve by hand.

851
01:30:16.467 --> 01:30:19.925
Let's go. We have to go down to the valve.

852
01:30:21.592 --> 01:30:23.967
-Boris…
-Let's go. guys.

853
01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:25.384
-Boris?
-No. Comrade Stysin.

854
01:30:25.467 --> 01:30:29.967
-We must get Boris out.
-It's so hot in here. Mom…

855
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:31.050
Boris?

856
01:30:43.134 --> 01:30:44.217
Where's Nikita?

857
01:30:50.467 --> 01:30:52.009
Where's Nikita?

858
01:30:56.634 --> 01:30:58.592
-I left my flashlight. I'll go get it.
-Nikita!

859
01:30:58.675 --> 01:30:59.884
Be quick.

860
01:31:24.342 --> 01:31:25.259
Almost there.

861
01:31:33.884 --> 01:31:34.925
Did you hear that?

862
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:39.967
Hear what?

863
01:31:42.884 --> 01:31:43.717
Water.

864
01:31:46.217 --> 01:31:47.217
Over there.

865
01:31:49.634 --> 01:31:51.675
Boris. take it easy.

866
01:31:52.759 --> 01:31:54.550
We're getting out of here.

867
01:31:59.175 --> 01:32:02.259
But this is the corridor
that goes straight to the valve.

868
01:32:03.175 --> 01:32:04.175
Let's go.

869
01:32:04.759 --> 01:32:06.759
Boris. wait. Boris!

870
01:32:07.842 --> 01:32:10.342
Wait! Boris. stop!

871
01:32:15.092 --> 01:32:16.092
Alex. you okay?

872
01:32:17.675 --> 01:32:20.550
-Go after him.
-Boris! Damn you!

873
01:32:20.634 --> 01:32:21.800
Boris!

874
01:32:24.467 --> 01:32:26.884
Boris. it's too close to the reactor!

875
01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:30.800
Stop! Stop right there!

876
01:32:32.217 --> 01:32:34.175
It's too close to the reactor. Boris!

877
01:32:49.467 --> 01:32:51.009
There's light ahead.

878
01:32:52.675 --> 01:32:55.925
-Stop! Boris!
-I see light!

879
01:32:57.634 --> 01:32:59.925
Guys. there's light ahead!

880
01:33:01.425 --> 01:33:02.884
I see light!

881
01:33:06.342 --> 01:33:09.634
Stop!

882
01:33:19.884 --> 01:33:20.759
Stop!

883
01:33:34.967 --> 01:33:38.050
Close the door! You'll burn to death!

884
01:33:56.009 --> 01:33:58.759
ENTRANCE

885
01:34:02.884 --> 01:34:04.217
Easy. Boris. Hang on.

886
01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:06.300
Alex!

887
01:34:08.592 --> 01:34:09.592
Alex!

888
01:34:11.884 --> 01:34:12.717
Quick!

889
01:34:15.175 --> 01:34:16.300
There's magma there.

890
01:34:17.134 --> 01:34:19.592
Magma. We have to get out.

891
01:34:22.259 --> 01:34:23.592
We've got to get out.

892
01:34:32.967 --> 01:34:34.425
Nikita… Where's Nikita?

893
01:34:35.967 --> 01:34:38.550
Get their clothes off
and get them to decontamination. now!

894
01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:46.009
There's magma there. Magma.

895
01:34:47.717 --> 01:34:49.592
Comrade Stysin…

896
01:34:53.342 --> 01:34:56.550
Let's go back down.
We need to open the valve.

897
01:34:56.634 --> 01:34:58.134
There's water in the corridors.

898
01:34:58.217 --> 01:35:00.884
Take it easy. Valery.
You've done your job.

899
01:35:00.967 --> 01:35:02.592
Call for a helicopter.

900
01:35:41.342 --> 01:35:42.884
How much did Boris get?

901
01:35:43.592 --> 01:35:45.050
Seven hundred rem. Perhaps more.

902
01:36:00.134 --> 01:36:03.675
They're sending liquidators
back in to carry on their work.

903
01:36:48.259 --> 01:36:49.300
Comrade Stysin.

904
01:36:59.134 --> 01:37:00.675
You'll have to come with us.

905
01:37:02.425 --> 01:37:04.050
Are you taking me in?

906
01:37:04.134 --> 01:37:05.092
Only for a talk.

907
01:37:05.175 --> 01:37:08.717
Just stand there. and listen quietly
while they dress you down.

908
01:37:12.134 --> 01:37:13.467
I won't listen quietly.

909
01:37:14.467 --> 01:37:16.175
Maybe your plan is better than mine.

910
01:37:16.259 --> 01:37:17.592
You wanna take a bunch of people

911
01:37:17.675 --> 01:37:19.509
and use them
to plug the hole in the reactor.

912
01:37:20.217 --> 01:37:23.384
We should've thought better
when they were building the damned thing.

913
01:37:23.467 --> 01:37:26.717
but we allowed it
to be built so that it would blow up.

914
01:37:28.175 --> 01:37:30.425
That's what I'm going to tell them.

915
01:37:31.175 --> 01:37:33.259
They can cover their asses all they want.

916
01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.467
Why don't you just mind your own business?

917
01:37:37.175 --> 01:37:39.384
Who are you fighting?

918
01:37:39.467 --> 01:37:42.050
The system? It's like radiation.

919
01:37:42.134 --> 01:37:46.092
Invisible. ever-present. and everlasting.

920
01:37:46.175 --> 01:37:47.550
Stop acting like a child.

921
01:37:49.967 --> 01:37:51.342
But I am a child.

922
01:37:53.759 --> 01:37:55.675
I'm a child of the Soviet regime.

923
01:38:44.175 --> 01:38:51.134
WARD NO. 2

924
01:38:58.217 --> 01:38:59.634
How are you feeling?

925
01:39:01.134 --> 01:39:03.259
-Fine.
-Get back in bed.

926
01:39:03.342 --> 01:39:04.425
How's Nikita?

927
01:39:04.509 --> 01:39:05.509
He's fine.

928
01:39:06.884 --> 01:39:10.175
Doctor. I'd like to have
five minutes with Alexey if that's okay.

929
01:39:11.467 --> 01:39:13.759
-You have five minutes.
-Thank you.

930
01:39:16.092 --> 01:39:17.175
Is that your mother?

931
01:39:18.175 --> 01:39:19.800
Why is she crying? You're alive.

932
01:39:21.842 --> 01:39:24.050
I'm gonna go down to open the valve.

933
01:39:30.884 --> 01:39:32.467
That's a suicide mission.

934
01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:42.425
There aren't enough volunteers.

935
01:39:43.384 --> 01:39:44.842
None. to be more precise.

936
01:39:46.134 --> 01:39:48.925
Only soldiers.
There's more than enough of them.

937
01:39:50.175 --> 01:39:51.550
But they're not volunteers.

938
01:39:52.509 --> 01:39:53.342
Yeah.

939
01:39:54.925 --> 01:39:56.342
They don't get much choice.

940
01:40:02.259 --> 01:40:03.884
Maybe they'll find another way?

941
01:40:04.467 --> 01:40:05.842
They can blow a hole in it…

942
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:07.884
or pump the water out.

943
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:12.175
Maybe they'll blow a hole in it.

944
01:40:13.925 --> 01:40:15.217
Maybe they won't.

945
01:40:18.925 --> 01:40:22.092
If whatever they do
doesn't work. it'll blow a hole in itself.

946
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:44.092
Right. I'll go back to my mom.

947
01:41:10.342 --> 01:41:12.509
You're done. Call the next one in.

948
01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:22.300
Hi. Olga.

949
01:42:44.717 --> 01:42:46.759
Why did you leave us?

950
01:42:46.842 --> 01:42:48.967
Why did you leave me back then?

951
01:42:49.050 --> 01:42:50.259
Why?

952
01:43:15.759 --> 01:43:17.592
I don't know what's wrong with him.

953
01:43:18.342 --> 01:43:20.009
They won't let me see him.

954
01:43:21.509 --> 01:43:24.175
I'm cutting hair here. so stupid…

955
01:43:35.759 --> 01:43:38.342
Right now. you and I
are going to go and get him.

956
01:43:40.384 --> 01:43:42.134
We'll put him on a plane to Switzerland.

957
01:43:42.675 --> 01:43:44.717
He'll get proper treatment there.

958
01:43:51.092 --> 01:43:52.800
What? What plane?

959
01:43:53.759 --> 01:43:56.342
I got him a seat
on a charter flight for radiation victims.

960
01:43:57.884 --> 01:43:59.717
What's wrong with him? Why Switzerland?

961
01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:03.467
Their doctors are better than ours.
It's the best possible option for him.

962
01:44:06.175 --> 01:44:08.175
He's going to be fine.

963
01:44:10.759 --> 01:44:12.550
We just have to get him…

964
01:44:13.759 --> 01:44:15.300
and put him on the plane.

965
01:45:09.509 --> 01:45:11.425
My boy. please forgive me.

966
01:45:11.509 --> 01:45:13.259
They wouldn't let me see you.

967
01:45:13.342 --> 01:45:16.342
You got to ride
with flashing lights. just like Gorbachev.

968
01:45:16.967 --> 01:45:19.092
Don't be scared.
You're going to get better there.

969
01:45:19.175 --> 01:45:20.550
Alexey Savostin?

970
01:45:21.259 --> 01:45:23.217
Yes. there's our little soldier.

971
01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.217
Please give me
your little soldier's documents

972
01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:26.509
and say your goodbyes.

973
01:45:27.592 --> 01:45:30.300
Will there be any doctors
who speak Russian over there?

974
01:45:30.384 --> 01:45:31.467
I'll be there.

975
01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:35.050
I love you. sweetie.

976
01:45:35.759 --> 01:45:37.134
Why are you leaving me?

977
01:45:39.217 --> 01:45:41.342
I'm not allowed to go with you.

978
01:45:41.425 --> 01:45:42.384
Don't leave me. Mom!

979
01:45:42.967 --> 01:45:43.800
Olga…

980
01:45:46.050 --> 01:45:47.134
Mom!

981
01:46:04.967 --> 01:46:06.134
Let's go.

982
01:46:40.384 --> 01:46:41.259
Olga. sit down.

983
01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.300
We didn't ask for the phone number.

984
01:47:06.384 --> 01:47:07.384
I'll get it.

985
01:47:09.467 --> 01:47:11.217
We have to call him every day.

986
01:47:16.634 --> 01:47:18.800
You've done
everything you could. Now relax.

987
01:47:20.425 --> 01:47:23.050
When he gets back.
he needs you to be strong for him.

988
01:47:26.592 --> 01:47:27.634
You're right.

989
01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:30.675
Thank you.

990
01:47:33.342 --> 01:47:35.217
I promised to be there for you. didn't I?

991
01:47:54.342 --> 01:47:55.717
I feel bad for how I treated you.

992
01:47:56.717 --> 01:47:57.842
And I'm scared.

993
01:48:00.009 --> 01:48:01.550
It's me who should feel bad.

994
01:48:31.592 --> 01:48:32.467
Alex.

995
01:48:39.634 --> 01:48:40.717
Alex.

996
01:48:56.342 --> 01:48:57.259
Alex. no.

997
01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:21.884
The Soviet nation
celebrates this year's May Day.

998
01:49:21.967 --> 01:49:26.509
full of vigor and creative energy.

999
01:49:27.217 --> 01:49:30.717
Festive crowds walked along Khreschatyk.

1000
01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:33.217
Kiev's main thoroughfare.

1001
01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.884
Tens of thousands
of people took part in the parade…

1002
01:50:12.592 --> 01:50:13.759
Alex?

1003
01:50:19.467 --> 01:50:20.300
Alex?

1004
01:50:30.675 --> 01:50:34.259
Olga. I'm sorry for leaving you again.
but I have to go back in there.

1005
01:50:34.342 --> 01:50:37.759
You have the best son in the world.
And you picked the best name for him!

1006
01:50:52.092 --> 01:50:53.634
I'm glad you volunteered.

1007
01:50:56.050 --> 01:50:57.967
I wish I could say the same.

1008
01:50:59.884 --> 01:51:03.509
Turns out I lied to you. We won't get
our victory lap around Red Square.

1009
01:51:04.175 --> 01:51:05.842
You're an idiot. Alex.

1010
01:51:08.259 --> 01:51:11.342
It's a shame Boris didn't make it
to see this historic moment.

1011
01:51:16.134 --> 01:51:18.342
It's a good thing
Alex can't talk underwater.

1012
01:52:18.967 --> 01:52:20.050
This way.

1013
01:52:45.217 --> 01:52:48.634
The water's almost 60C… like they said.

1014
01:52:49.967 --> 01:52:53.009
Valery… since nobody can hear us here…

1015
01:52:54.967 --> 01:52:57.050
why did this thing really blow up?

1016
01:52:58.759 --> 01:53:00.050
Because of people.

1017
01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:05.717
Which people exactly?

1018
01:53:10.384 --> 01:53:11.800
Does it matter?

1019
01:53:23.467 --> 01:53:24.509
You ready? Let's go.

1020
01:54:30.509 --> 01:54:31.509
What's the matter?

1021
01:54:33.592 --> 01:54:36.842
I'm not scared.
my hands are just shaking like crazy.

1022
01:54:38.175 --> 01:54:41.175
I'll open the valve myself.
I can't wait any longer. it's too hot.

1023
01:54:41.259 --> 01:54:42.717
Wait for me.

1024
01:54:46.134 --> 01:54:47.217
I can't.

1025
01:57:32.842 --> 01:57:34.717
Ivan. the water's draining.

1026
01:57:46.425 --> 01:57:48.300
The water's draining. They did it.

1027
02:02:54.509 --> 02:02:57.717
They found him after the water drained.
Everyone thought he was dead.

1028
02:03:03.759 --> 02:03:04.842
How do I look?

1029
02:03:06.884 --> 02:03:08.217
Good enough.

1030
02:03:15.717 --> 02:03:17.300
Why don't you take him to Kiev?

1031
02:03:20.342 --> 02:03:23.717
Three hours of being rattled around
on the road won't do him any good.

1032
02:03:25.717 --> 02:03:26.800
Listen.

1033
02:03:30.759 --> 02:03:31.967
He's radioactive.

1034
02:03:32.050 --> 02:03:34.925
Keep contact to a minimum.
It could be very dangerous.

1035
02:03:45.884 --> 02:03:47.259
ISOLATION WARD - STAFF ONLY

1036
02:04:05.509 --> 02:04:12.467
KEEP OUT

1037
02:06:29.217 --> 02:06:33.092
THREE MONTHS LATER

1038
02:08:58.425 --> 02:09:05.384
DEDICATED TO THE CHERNOBYL LIQUIDATORS
