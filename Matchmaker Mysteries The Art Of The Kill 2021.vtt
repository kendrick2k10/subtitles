00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.266
I don't know if this
means anything.

912
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.567
but I saw a woman arguing
with Simon Beaucamp

913
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.100
about Clinton Jennings.

914
00:38:56.233 --> 00:39:00.667
Uh... Do you know how
Clinton Jennings

915
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:03.133
got a box of the cookies
two days ago?

916
00:39:03.266 --> 00:39:05.500
The bakery delivered
them early

917
00:39:05.633 --> 00:39:07.166
and they delivered more
than we needed.

918
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.000
so I gave a few of the extra
boxes to some of the staff.

919
00:39:09.133 --> 00:39:12.100
But Clinton wasn't
one of them.

920
00:39:12.233 --> 00:39:13.834
Okay.

921
00:39:13.967 --> 00:39:16.033
And what's the name of
those staff members?

922
00:39:16.166 --> 00:39:19.700
Sam Garrett. Patricia Reynolds.
Carmen Dioppe.

923
00:39:19.834 --> 00:39:21.934
and Myra Tolin.

924
00:39:22.066 --> 00:39:23.934
♪

925
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.867

926
00:39:35.066 --> 00:39:36.867
[knocking]

927
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.734
Other cookies got
the all-clear.

928
00:39:38.867 --> 00:39:40.333
Looks like it was just
the Jennings box.

929
00:39:40.467 --> 00:39:42.066
Which means it
was deliberate.

930
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.900
Oh. Myra Tolin
is waiting in room 2.

931
00:39:45.033 --> 00:39:46.967
[sighs]
All right.

932
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.700
So Miss Ricci gave you
the box of those

933
00:39:49.834 --> 00:39:52.333
little Italian cookies. right?

934
00:39:52.467 --> 00:39:55.000
Want to tell me how they ended
up in Jennings's office?

935
00:39:55.133 --> 00:39:57.734
I gave them to him.

936
00:39:57.867 --> 00:39:59.066
When?

937
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.467
The day they arrived.
I left them on his desk.

938
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.934
Why?

939
00:40:03.066 --> 00:40:05.500
You're not a fan of cookies?

940
00:40:05.633 --> 00:40:07.567
Um... I'm diabetic.

941
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.734
The cookies are loaded
with sugar.

942
00:40:10.867 --> 00:40:12.800
Hmm.

943
00:40:12.934 --> 00:40:14.834
Am I a suspect?

944
00:40:14.967 --> 00:40:17.467
I just need to talk
to everyone.

945
00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.567
Have you spoken to Derek?

946
00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.467
Derek...

947
00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.667
Holland.

948
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.800
He's a graduate student
at Hearst.

949
00:40:25.934 --> 00:40:28.667
Um. he worked with
Doctor Jennings on the exhibit.

950
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.100
He wasn't at the museum
when we interviewed the staff.

951
00:40:32.233 --> 00:40:35.367
That's 'cause he was fired
a week ago.

952
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.300
Fired for what?

953
00:40:37.433 --> 00:40:39.367
He was supposed to be helping
with the provenance.

954
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.934
but Doctor Jennings was
dissatisfied with his work.

955
00:40:42.066 --> 00:40:43.900
Derek took it pretty hard.

956
00:40:44.033 --> 00:40:45.900
They fought about it.

957
00:40:46.033 --> 00:40:48.166
So you think that Derek
may have been involved

958
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.066
in Jennings's murder because
he was kicked off the team?

959
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.166
Uh. no. I...

960
00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.367
I think he may have been
involved because the cookies

961
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.433
came from his family's bakery.

962
00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:06.300

963
00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:14.266
How are you doing?

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.433
Looking for Derek Holland.

965
00:41:15.567 --> 00:41:17.734
Maybe this icing
will be easier?

966
00:41:17.867 --> 00:41:19.467
I don't know.

967
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.533
No!

968
00:41:20.667 --> 00:41:21.700
[laughs]

969
00:41:21.834 --> 00:41:22.700
Keep trying.
This one's good.

970
00:41:22.834 --> 00:41:23.767
This is terrible!

971

975
00:41:32.533 --> 00:41:34.533
They're really good.

976

I'm interviewing a
potential suspect.

979
00:41:41.266 --> 00:41:43.734
What. wait. you think Derek
has something to do

980
00:41:43.867 --> 00:41:45.867
with Clinton Jennings's murder?

981
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.433
Isn't that why you're here?

982
00:41:48.567 --> 00:41:49.934
No!

983
00:41:50.066 --> 00:41:51.600
I'm trying to find him
a match.

984
00:41:51.734 --> 00:41:55.800
This okay?

985
00:41:55.934 --> 00:41:56.867
We can talk here.

986
00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.266
Uh. yeah.

987
00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.166
So.

988
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.367
I'm just going to cut
to the chase.

989
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.600
Where were you on the night
of the 4th?

990
00:42:06.734 --> 00:42:08.433
Uh...

991
00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:09.767
I was in class until 6:00
and then I went home.

992
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.667
Okay. Straight home?

993
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.934
Yes.

994
00:42:14.066 --> 00:42:14.934
No.

995
00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:16.633
Uh... Which is it?

996
00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:18.967
I got pizza at Gino's.

997
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.500
Hmm.

998
00:42:21.633 --> 00:42:22.967
Did you pay with a card?

999
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.333
Cash.

1000
00:42:24.467 --> 00:42:26.667
Okay. Can anyone
confirm this?

1001
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.266
Uh. the cashier?
It was really busy.

1002
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.000
You might still have
the receipt.

1003
00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:34.967
I can look.

1004
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.533
So a week before
Doctor Jennings's murder.

1005
00:42:38.667 --> 00:42:40.467
you were fired.

1006
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.734
Fired?

1007
00:42:41.867 --> 00:42:44.367
They said that you weren't
meeting expectations at work.

1008
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.567
He did let me go. yeah.
But that's not why.

1009
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.200
As part of my work
for Doctor Jennings.

1010
00:42:52.333 --> 00:42:54.367
I was helping with
the provenance

1011
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.367
and I started to notice
inconsistencies.

1012
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.367
And when I first told Doctor
Jennings about it.

1013
00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.166
he was responsive.

1014
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.233
Even grateful.

1015
00:43:03.367 --> 00:43:05.800
But when I brought it up again
he got defensive

1016
00:43:05.934 --> 00:43:07.800
and accused me
of sloppy research.

1017
00:43:07.934 --> 00:43:10.000
Hmm.

1018
00:43:10.133 --> 00:43:11.900
Did you think he was
hiding something?

1019
00:43:12.033 --> 00:43:13.900
Maybe.

1020
00:43:14.033 --> 00:43:15.567
But Doctor Jennings
was the type of person

1021
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.900
who didn't like
to be questioned.

1022
00:43:17.033 --> 00:43:19.367
Especially by some lowly
grad student.

1023
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.200
That was a pretty prestigious
placement. huh?

1024
00:43:23.333 --> 00:43:25.500
Could've led to a full-time job
at the museum.

1025
00:43:25.633 --> 00:43:29.667
Must've been quite a blow.

1026
00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.700
No sense dwelling on
what I can't control.

1027
00:43:35.967 --> 00:43:40.266
-Thanks.
-Uh-huh.

1028
00:43:40.667 --> 00:43:43.900
You don't really think that
Derek could murder someone?

1029
00:43:44.033 --> 00:43:46.467
I mean he makes
puff pastries.

1030
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.333
I think your feelings are
clouding your judgement.

1031
00:43:49.467 --> 00:43:52.200
And what's wrong with seeing
the best in people?

1032
00:43:52.333 --> 00:43:53.266
Oh. nothing.

1033
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.834
In your line of work
it's probably an asset.

1034
00:43:54.967 --> 00:43:57.667
For me. uh...
looks can be deceiving.

1035
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.667
That's awfully cynical.

1036
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.433
It's just the way it is.

1037
00:44:01.567 --> 00:44:04.467
Well. I believe in giving people
a chance to surprise you.

1038
00:44:04.834 --> 00:44:06.767
I got a surprise for you.

1039
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.333
Remember after our
last murder case

1040
00:44:08.467 --> 00:44:10.600
I promised to take you out
for dessert?

1041
00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:12.400
Did you?

1042
00:44:12.533 --> 00:44:14.633
I... I mean I guess
technically you did.

1043
00:44:14.767 --> 00:44:18.233
[laughs]

1044
00:44:18.367 --> 00:44:19.934
You want to buy me
a cinnamon bun?

1045
00:44:20.066 --> 00:44:21.800
I'm more of a traditional
donut guy.

1046
00:44:21.934 --> 00:44:23.600
Because you're a cop?
Cops like donuts?

1047
00:44:23.734 --> 00:44:25.400
-Pretty much.
-Yeah.

1048
00:44:25.533 --> 00:44:27.200
How about tonight?

1049
00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:33.767
Tonight? No. I mean uh.
I can do... Thursday?

1050
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.467
Yeah. Thursday works. 8:00?

1051
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.667
It's a date.

1052
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.767
Uh?

1053
00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.767
-I mean. not a date.
-Not a date.

1054
00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.000
It's just a dessert.

1055
00:44:42.133 --> 00:44:43.166
Right.

1056
00:44:43.567 --> 00:44:45.233
All right. I'll pick you up.

1057
00:44:51.667 --> 00:44:53.233
Andrew. tell me.

1058
00:44:53.367 --> 00:44:54.934
What are you looking
for in a woman?

1059
00:44:55.066 --> 00:44:56.767
Shared values.

1060
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.166
Someone I can take home
to my mother.

1061
00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.467
Aw. that's very sweet.

1062
00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.600
Describe your ideal date.

1063
00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:07.600
Maybe a walk on the beach.
and then I could cook dinner.

1064
00:45:07.734 --> 00:45:09.567
You cook?

1065
00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.734
I make a mean shrimp scampi.

1066
00:45:10.867 --> 00:45:12.467
My mother has
a great recipe.

1067
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.834
Aww.

1068
00:45:13.967 --> 00:45:16.467
You two seem very close.
you and your mother.

1069
00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.433
Oh.

1070
00:45:18.567 --> 00:45:19.433
[laughs]

1071
00:45:19.567 --> 00:45:21.367
We're close. but we're
not that close.

1072
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:24.567
We live on completely separate
floors in the house.

1073
00:45:33.266 --> 00:45:35.300
You have mail.

1074
00:45:37.533 --> 00:45:40.533
Matches or murder?

1075
00:45:40.667 --> 00:45:42.000
Murder.

1076
00:45:42.133 --> 00:45:43.233
For now.

1077
00:45:43.367 --> 00:45:45.633
I should really
get another board.

1078
00:45:45.767 --> 00:45:46.633
Oh.

1079
00:45:46.767 --> 00:45:47.867
A-ha!

1080
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.066
I tracked down the photographer
from the exhibit opening

1081
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.066
and I got him
to send us copies.

1082
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.800
How did you manage that?

1083
00:45:53.934 --> 00:45:55.633
I promised we'd hire him

1084
00:45:55.767 --> 00:45:56.967
to shoot next season's
publicity shots.

1085
00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.467
I forwarded you his quote.

1086
00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.934
It's a little high.

1087
00:46:01.967 --> 00:46:04.066
That's a lot of suspects.

1088
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.867
They all wanted
Clinton Jennings dead?

1089
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.633
Well. I don't know.

1090
00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:12.233
This is Myra Tolin.
Jennings's assistant

1091
00:46:12.367 --> 00:46:14.100
and probably secret girlfriend.

1092
00:46:14.233 --> 00:46:17.300
I mean. could heartbreak
be the motive?

1093
00:46:17.433 --> 00:46:19.266
Jealousy?

1094
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.867
Derek Holland.

1095
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.633
He was fired a week before
the murder.

1096
00:46:22.767 --> 00:46:24.533
so he had an axe to grind.

1097
00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:27.867
Simon Beaucamp.

1098
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.133
the art dealer who sold
the statues to the museum.

1099
00:46:30.266 --> 00:46:31.800
If Jennings uncovered fraud

1100
00:46:31.934 --> 00:46:33.934
it would be very costly
for Beaucamp.

1101
00:46:34.066 --> 00:46:36.600
And there's one more.

1102
00:46:36.734 --> 00:46:39.700
A-ha! Yes!

1103
00:46:39.834 --> 00:46:41.900
I saw this woman arguing
with Beaucamp

1104
00:46:42.033 --> 00:46:43.133
about Clinton at the museum.

1105
00:46:43.266 --> 00:46:44.800
Well who is she?

1106
00:46:44.934 --> 00:46:45.800
I don't know.

1107
00:46:45.934 --> 00:46:47.500
But I know who might.

1108
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.500
Yes. Lucia Ricci. please.

1109
00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.734
Miss Ricci.
it's Angie Dove.

1110
00:47:00.867 --> 00:47:03.266
I wonder if you could help me
identify someone.

1111
00:47:16.533 --> 00:47:18.367
Doctor Jennings?

1112
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.367
Uh. do you have a moment?

1113
00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.200
I'm Angie Dove.

1114
00:47:22.333 --> 00:47:24.033
Miss Dove.

1115
00:47:24.166 --> 00:47:26.700
I must admit I was very
surprised to receive your email.

1116
00:47:26.834 --> 00:47:29.100
My show is always looking
for Philadelphia's

1117
00:47:29.233 --> 00:47:31.500
best and brightest to showcase
on the program.

1118
00:47:31.633 --> 00:47:34.300
And. you know. we've never
had a botanist.

1119
00:47:34.433 --> 00:47:36.266
Well. I hate to disappoint.

1120
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.133
but I do not require the
services of a matchmaker.

1121
00:47:39.567 --> 00:47:43.000
I was just making some tea.
Would you like some?

1122
00:47:43.133 --> 00:47:44.700
Sure.

1123
00:47:44.834 --> 00:47:46.367
Do you take milk. sugar?

1124
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.433
No. thank you.

1125
00:47:52.233 --> 00:47:54.066
Huh.

1126
00:47:54.633 --> 00:47:57.200
Please don't touch that!

1127
00:47:57.333 --> 00:47:58.633
Sorry.

1128
00:47:58.767 --> 00:48:01.400
That's Cnidoscolus stimulosus.

1129
00:48:01.533 --> 00:48:03.867
Contact with the skin results
in a painful sting

1130
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.800
and lingering rash.

1131
00:48:06.266 --> 00:48:08.834
This pretty little flower
can do all that?

1132
00:48:08.967 --> 00:48:10.934
Looks can be deceiving.

1133
00:48:11.367 --> 00:48:14.667
For example. that purple flower
over there is Wolfsbane.

1134
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.300
It contains a neurotoxin
called aconitine.

1135
00:48:17.433 --> 00:48:19.200
Very deadly.

1136
00:48:19.333 --> 00:48:21.433
Hmm.

1137
00:48:21.567 --> 00:48:24.033
Thank you.

1138
00:48:25.433 --> 00:48:27.667
[sighs]

1139
00:48:40.533 --> 00:48:44.533
Oh. it is still a little hot.

1140
00:48:56.367 --> 00:48:57.934
How is it?

1141
00:48:58.066 --> 00:48:59.333
Nice.

1142
00:48:59.467 --> 00:49:01.567
Um. chamomile?

1143
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.867
A hibiscus blend.

1144
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.867
Oh. yes. it does have a bit of
a floral undertone.

1145
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.767
It does.

1146
00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.667
Now. why are you here really?

1147
00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:14.500
[laughs]

1148
00:49:14.633 --> 00:49:15.734
What do you mean?

1149
00:49:15.867 --> 00:49:17.734
Let's not play games.
Miss Dove.

1150
00:49:17.867 --> 00:49:19.900
You were at the exhibit opening

1151
00:49:20.033 --> 00:49:22.133
asking questions
about my late brother.

1152
00:49:22.266 --> 00:49:26.333
and now you're here at my office
with a very flimsy cover story.

1153
00:49:26.467 --> 00:49:29.500
Well. I thought it was
pretty good. but...

1154
00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:33.066
You're right.

1155
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.967
I came to ask you about
an argument you had

1156
00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:38.867
with Simon Beaucamp.

1157
00:49:39.467 --> 00:49:41.967
Simon and I were discussing
a personal matter.

1158
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:44.400
Do you mind me asking
what that personal matter was?

1159
00:49:44.533 --> 00:49:45.900
I do.

1160
00:49:46.033 --> 00:49:47.300

They are.

My mother passed
10 years ago.

1165

It was very hard
on Clinton and me.

I'm sorry.

1167
00:50:04.467 --> 00:50:07.467
That's a very striking necklace.

1168

It's a family heirloom.

1169

Clinton always loved it.

1170
00:50:11.633 --> 00:50:13.934
My mother left it to him.

1171
00:50:16.667 --> 00:50:20.767
You know. on second thought
I would like some sugar.

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.266
Duplicates.

1272
00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.433
Mmmhmm.

1273
00:54:52.567 --> 00:54:53.700
And a building
full of valuables.

1274
00:54:53.834 --> 00:54:57.100
But our guy only goes after
the items he can easily move.

1275
00:54:58.066 --> 00:55:00.767
Now this is someone
who's after quick money.

1276
00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.700
Hmm.

1277
00:55:02.834 --> 00:55:04.467
Do you really not like
that couch?

1278
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.633
I picked it out myself.

1279
00:55:06.767 --> 00:55:09.300
Nobody likes that couch.

1280
00:55:09.567 --> 00:55:10.233
Huh.

1281
00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:13.633
So you told me that
you haven't spoken

1282
00:55:13.767 --> 00:55:14.767
to your brother in months.

1283
00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:15.967
It was one time.

1284
00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:19.033
and it was a conversation
I didn't wish to relive.

1285
00:55:19.166 --> 00:55:20.667
Well unfortunately I'm going
to have to ask you

1286
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.633
to relive it for the moment.
okay?

1287
00:55:22.767 --> 00:55:24.900
So you went to The Oswald Museum
last month

1288
00:55:25.033 --> 00:55:26.934
to borrow some money
from your brother.

1289
00:55:27.066 --> 00:55:28.800
Why?

1290
00:55:28.934 --> 00:55:30.166
I owed some debts.

1291
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.700
I didn't have anyone else
to turn to.

1292
00:55:31.834 --> 00:55:34.667
What kind of debts?

1293
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.133
I have an affinity
for nice things.

1294
00:55:38.266 --> 00:55:41.834
It can get me into trouble.

1295
00:55:41.967 --> 00:55:45.367
I just needed to buy
a little more time.

1296
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.800
but Clinton refused.

1297
00:55:47.934 --> 00:55:50.000
That must have made
you angry.

1298
00:55:50.133 --> 00:55:52.200
I was disappointed.

1299
00:55:52.333 --> 00:55:54.967
Did you ask him again?

1300
00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:56.266
No.

1301
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.967
He made it clear
the first time

1302
00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.066
that I could not count
on his help.

1303
00:56:04.233 --> 00:56:07.500
Someone here to see you.

1304
00:56:09.066 --> 00:56:13.800
Have a seat.

1305
00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:18.834
What's going on?

1306
00:56:18.967 --> 00:56:20.600
I just wanted to apologize.

1307
00:56:20.734 --> 00:56:24.867
You've been so kind and
I'm sorry I wasn't up front.

1308
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.066
Well. you had your reasons.

1309
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.066
You had us pegged
from the beginning.

1310
00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.000
How'd you know?

1311
00:56:32.133 --> 00:56:33.200
I saw your heart.

1312
00:56:33.333 --> 00:56:37.200
No matter the bluff.
there's always a tell.

1313
00:56:38.533 --> 00:56:42.700
You loved him.

1314
00:56:42.834 --> 00:56:44.266
I did.

1315
00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.066
I just wish he felt the same.

1316
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.266
He ended things?

1317
00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:52.400
When?

1318
00:56:52.533 --> 00:56:55.033
A few days before he died.

1319
00:56:55.166 --> 00:56:58.867
-Myra?
-You see how that looks?

1320
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.400
I can't tell the cops.

1321
00:57:01.533 --> 00:57:03.900
But if they find out and they
realize that I lied again?

1322
00:57:04.033 --> 00:57:06.567
Angie. I don't know what to do.

1323
00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.033
You have to tell Detective
Carter everything.

Can I meet you
at the station?

1326
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:26.400
You're at The Oswald?

Yes.

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.200
Clinton's cell phone.

This is a real problem.

00:58:25.333 --> 00:58:26.166
I know.

1346
00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.533
If Myra didn't kill Jennings.

1347
00:58:27.667 --> 00:58:29.200
then why does she have
a stolen phone?

1348
00:58:29.333 --> 00:58:31.734
I meant the bachelors.

1349
00:58:31.867 --> 00:58:33.233
We need to fill in
our final segment

1350
00:58:33.367 --> 00:58:34.533

a match.

Tony or Andrew?

No. we're pushing that exhibit
back to January.

Yes. to accommodate
the gallery.

Mr. Columba.
thank you for calling.

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.934
Of course.

1367
00:59:09.066 --> 00:59:10.066
I've got some good news.

1368
00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.967
I tracked down two of the items
to a pawn shop.

1369
00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.333
Now the owner is willing
to send me his tapes.

1370

We'll see if we can get a good
look at who sold them.

1371

That won't be necessary.
We found our thief.

One of the janitorial
staff confessed.

your check sent out.

00:59:35.266 --> 00:59:37.233
Thanks.

1379

you out of here. okay?

But in order to do that you have
to help me find the person

1382
00:59:47.433 --> 00:59:49.567
who actually killed
Clinton Jennings.

1383
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.033
How can I do that
in this place?

1384
00:59:52.166 --> 00:59:53.333
Talk to me.

1385
00:59:53.467 --> 00:59:55.900
Let's go through everything
that you know.

1386
00:59:56.033 --> 00:59:58.033
-Okay.
-Okay.

1387
00:59:58.166 --> 00:59:59.633
So if someone stole
Clinton's laptop.

1388
00:59:59.767 --> 01:00:01.967
maybe they were interested
in what was on it.

1389
01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.633
Documents. emails?

1390
01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:06.100
He'd have a lot of those saved
to the cloud.

1391
01:00:06.233 --> 01:00:10.233
You wouldn't happen to know
his password. would you?

1392
01:00:10.367 --> 01:00:12.266
Maybe we could access
them remotely.

1393
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.233
No.

1394
01:00:14.367 --> 01:00:17.233
Derek...

1395
01:00:17.367 --> 01:00:18.533
Derek?

1396
01:00:18.667 --> 01:00:20.800
He might know Clinton's
login information.

1397
01:00:20.934 --> 01:00:22.800
I'll ask him.

1398
01:00:22.934 --> 01:00:26.567
Do you need anything?

1399
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.800
Just please get me
out of here.

1400
01:00:28.934 --> 01:00:31.734
I'll do my best.

1401
01:00:31.867 --> 01:00:34.867
And Angie...

1402
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.967
Thank you.

1403
01:00:44.066 --> 01:00:46.300
Okay. so what do you got?

1404
01:00:46.433 --> 01:00:47.500
The phone's wiped.

1405
01:00:47.633 --> 01:00:48.433

01:00:48.567 --> 01:00:49.867
Forensics couldn't find
a thing.

1407
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.767
Anything that was on it.
gone.

1408
01:00:53.967 --> 01:00:56.633
But why would Myra take the time
to wipe the phone

1409
01:00:56.767 --> 01:00:58.333
instead of just disposing of it?

1410
01:00:58.467 --> 01:01:00.800
Well you think it
could've been planted?

1411
01:01:00.934 --> 01:01:03.533
Well we're already looking
in her direction.

1412
01:01:03.667 --> 01:01:06.533
Maybe somebody's just trying
to push the investigation along.

1413
01:01:06.667 --> 01:01:08.533
Hmm.

1414
01:01:08.667 --> 01:01:09.867
Thank you.

1415
01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.300

Miss Dove. um...

1417
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.767
Is this a good time?

1418
01:01:20.066 --> 01:01:22.300
Yeah. sure.

1419
01:01:22.433 --> 01:01:24.767
Um. sorry. I just wasn't

No.

1425
01:01:38.767 --> 01:01:40.500
It's about Myra Tolin.

1426
01:01:40.633 --> 01:01:43.100
What about her?

1427
01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:44.567
She's been arrested.

1428
01:01:45.266 --> 01:01:47.433
What. you think she killed
Doctor Jennings?

1429
01:01:47.567 --> 01:01:49.200
I don't think so.

1430
01:01:49.333 --> 01:01:51.567
And I'd like to help clear
her name.

1431
01:01:53.233 --> 01:01:55.367
She seems to think that
you might have access

1432
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.166
to Doctor Jennings's
account information.

1433
01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.367
Logins. passwords?

1434
01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.400
Not off the top of my head. no.

1435
01:02:01.533 --> 01:02:03.233
Um. but maybe in the paperwork.

1436
01:02:03.367 --> 01:02:05.600
I... I can check my files.
It'll just take a minute.

1437
01:02:05.734 --> 01:02:06.667
Oh. great.

1438
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.233

What are you hoping to find
in Doctor Jennings's emails?

1442
01:02:31.066 --> 01:02:33.533
Oh. you know.
Probably nothing.

1443
01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:36.233
[nervously]
It's just a... just a hunch.

1444
01:02:36.367 --> 01:02:39.900
Oh. Well. here's everything
from my time at The Oswald.

1445
01:02:40.033 --> 01:02:42.200
I'm not sure if it'll be useful
but you're welcome to it.

Great. thanks.

1803
01:21:37.166 --> 01:21:38.567
She's your kid.

♪

1805
01:21:42.633 --> 01:21:45.066
It's a match.

1806
01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.567
Wow. You always do this.

1807
01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:48.367
Do what?

1808
01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:50.533
Pull a rabbit out of a hat?

1809
01:21:50.667 --> 01:21:52.567
I never thought we'd find
someone for Jessica.

1810
01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.467
Ye of little faith.

1811
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:56.333
I had plenty of faith.

1812
01:21:56.467 --> 01:21:57.967
What we didn't have
was viable suitors.

1813
01:21:58.100 --> 01:21:59.633
Yeah.

1814
01:21:59.767 --> 01:22:03.300
Well. sometimes
you gotta improvise.

1815
01:22:03.433 --> 01:22:05.367
Wow. um. I love that book.

1816
01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.200
Really?

1817
01:22:06.333 --> 01:22:07.233
Do you... do you read a lot?

1818
01:22:07.367 --> 01:22:09.600
Yeah. Actually. I'm studying
library sciences.

1819
01:22:09.734 --> 01:22:11.800
Oh. my goodness.
I work at a library.

1820
01:22:11.934 --> 01:22:12.834
-Really?
-Yeah.

1821
01:22:12.967 --> 01:22:13.667
No way.

1822
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:14.600
Yeah. You should
come by sometime.

1823
01:22:14.734 --> 01:22:15.633
Okay.

1824
01:22:15.767 --> 01:22:17.233
We have some
pretty good books.

1825
01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:17.900
Yeah.

1826
01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:18.600
Staff's not bad either.

1827
01:22:18.734 --> 01:22:19.700
Cheers.

1828
01:22:19.834 --> 01:22:20.800
[laughs] Aww.

1829
01:22:20.934 --> 01:22:21.734
[laughing]

1830
01:22:21.867 --> 01:22:23.734
They are so cute.

1831
01:22:23.867 --> 01:22:25.033
Yeah.

1833

Want to grab drinks?

1834
01:22:32.033 --> 01:22:34.667
Rain check.

1835
01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.934
Hello.

1836
01:22:37.066 --> 01:22:38.767
Hey.

1837
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.467
You know. you take
an awful lot of risks

1838
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.567
for somebody who doesn't carry
a badge or a gun.

1839

[laughs]

1840
01:22:46.266 --> 01:22:49.734
I guess I'm lucky I have you
to back me up.

1841
01:22:49.867 --> 01:22:52.233
So I'm closing up
this case file

1842
01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:54.767
and I've got a couple loose ends
I want to run by you.

1843
01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.367
I'm always happy to help.

1844
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:57.633
Okay.

1845
01:22:58.734 --> 01:23:00.367
Are you hungry?

1846
01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:01.867
Uh. yeah.

1847

Frank & Carla's on 5th?

1848
01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:05.800
They have the best
Philly Cheese Steaks.

[sighs]
So good.

1850
01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:09.433
And great desserts.

1851
01:23:09.567 --> 01:23:11.367
Ah. I see what you did there.

1853
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.533
-Yeah.
-It's Friday night though.

1854
01:23:13.667 --> 01:23:15.533
I really doubt we're going
to get in there.

1855
01:23:15.667 --> 01:23:17.033
Oh. please.

1856
01:23:17.166 --> 01:23:19.467
Who do you think introduced
Frank to Carla?

1857
01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.734
Of course you did.

1858
01:23:21.867 --> 01:23:23.800
Let's do it.

1859
01:23:23.934 --> 01:23:24.800
Okay.

Oh. great.
Another match.

Ooh.

Yep.

1864
01:23:29.133 --> 01:23:30.367
You're batting 1000.

1865
01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:31.433
Of course.

1866
01:23:31.834 --> 01:23:32.934
There we go.

1867
01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.233
Thank you.
