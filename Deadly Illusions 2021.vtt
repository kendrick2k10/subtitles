You guys have a seat

Delirium. as you know. is still

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:20.237
So. you want to do a spinoff
and hire a ghost writer.

43
00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.157
You know how I feel
about this. Go ahead.

The numbers. they make sense.

53
00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:43.635
One more book in the series and
we can make it over the edge.

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:46.554
-Get through the transition--
-Stop. stop. stop right now.

55

Uh. this is not what I thought
we were meeting about.

56
00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:51.852
You mislead me. Kioki.

57
00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:54.229
I thought this was
something totally different.

Mary. I'm just trying to--

59
00:05:55.856 --> 00:05:57.274
You've been
through this before.

60
00:05:57.316 --> 00:05:58.733

find a way out.

about your children.

have a roof over their head

Yet there was
a time when Mary

75
00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:41.902
couldn't even get one publisher
to read her work.

76
00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:44.905
So. she resorted to
writing salacious stories.

77
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:47.490
and now gets to sit back
and rake in residuals

78
00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:49.701
without a single thought
to how she got there

79
00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.828
or who put her there.

80
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.580

You don't know what
you're talking about.

84
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.547

tell me about this?

-That's more money up front

combined.

mean to keep anything from you.

-I didn't even see this.
-I know.

109

seriously consider this.

...it was before we ever...

00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:04.854
[sharply] When?

131
00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:06.481
When did you make that trade?

132
00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:13.113
Um. six months ago.

133
00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:18.368
Six months ago and
you're just telling me?

134
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.079
Tom! How much?

135
00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.165
Nearly half. I think it was...

136
00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.794
Nearly half of the reserves?

137
00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:30.464
Half of the reserves?!

138
00:10:30.505 --> 00:10:32.132
You-- You promised me!

139
00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:35.051

would never do that again!

I don't know.

144
00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.852
You've never seen me
when I'm writing.

145
00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:28.938
Doesn't matter.

146
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.149
After it's over.
you go back to normal. right?

[Mary]
Mmm...

148
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:40.825

This could be the perfect thing

150
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:46.789
to get your ass out the door.

151
00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:50.377
You could add momentum
to enter a new chapter.

152
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.462
To do the things
that you want to do

153
00:11:52.504 --> 00:11:55.089
so you can create the things
you want to create.

154
00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:59.886
What you need
is a full-time sitter.

155
00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:02.263
Oh. what you
mean to say is "nanny."

156
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.475
Mm-mm. I did not spend
thousands of dollars

157
00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:06.851
to conceive those children

158
00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.436
just to spend thousands more

159
00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:10.522
to pay somebody else
to take care of them.

160
00:12:10.564 --> 00:12:13.567
I have a client. she's
a headhunter for sitters.

161
00:12:13.608 --> 00:12:15.068
Mm-hmm?

162
00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:16.403
Here.

163
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:18.737
Hmm.

164
00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.408
Well. if she's so great.

165
00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:23.034
why aren't you using her?

166
00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.536
Well. I can't afford her.

167
00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:27.664
Plus. she only takes on
certain clients.

168
00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:29.290
Oh. hell. no!

169
00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:32.544
No. those kids always
end up with problems.

170
00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:35.129
I only work at the office
three days a week.

171
00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.465
but if I had to work full-time.

172
00:12:37.507 --> 00:12:39.384
this is what I would use
for child care.

173
00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.511
The girls she recruits.
they're different.

174
00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.054
They go to ivy league schools.

175
00:12:43.096 --> 00:12:44.889
they're fluent in
at least two languages.

176
00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:47.141
they cook. they clean.
run errands. everything.

177
00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:48.809
I'm telling you. Mary.

178
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:50.729
it's exactly what you need
to get through.

179
00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:52.063
Mm.

-[Angela] Hello. Mary.
-Hi.

190
00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:44.865
It's so nice to
finally meet you.

191
00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:46.534
-I'm Angela.
-Nice to meet you.

192
00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.328
If you come follow me.
I'll show you around.

193
00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:49.579

So. here we have
a little activity room.

00:13:58.546 --> 00:13:59.880
[Angela]
Of course. we have

200
00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.758
a state-of-the-art
security system.

201
00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:10.849
Most parents prefer to have
help inside the home.

202
00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:12.602
but should you ever
need to go out of town

203
00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.437
and want supervision.
we can provide it.

204
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.063
-Huh.
-[Angela] I must say. Mary.

205
00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:17.691
I think you will be
very pleased

with what we can offer.

207
00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:21.277
Our young women come
from impeccable backgrounds.

208
00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.363
Many of them are
attending prestigious schools

209
00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.573
and looking for creative ways
to pay tuition.

210
00:14:25.615 --> 00:14:28.242
We provide scholarships
based on performance.

211
00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:29.619
How about I send over

212
00:14:29.661 --> 00:14:31.538
a few potentials
for you to meet with?

213
00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:32.955
If none of them work out.

214
00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.290

221

Oh. my God. I love your house!

It's great for photos.

I recently got engaged. so.

eight years old.

How are the interviews going?

240
00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:30.889
No one impressive.

241

But. I mean.
they're nice girls.

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:34.851
Not one?

243
00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:37.896
Think you're being
a little hard on 'em?

244
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.980
[Mary] Maybe this
just isn't a good idea.

245
00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:41.733
[Tom]
Mary. I think you're anxious

246
00:15:41.775 --> 00:15:44.026
and apprehensive.
but you and I both know

247
00:15:44.068 --> 00:15:46.529
if you don't have any help
with the menial stuff.

248
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:47.906
it'll absolutely kill you.

249
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.741
Plus. it might be
good for the kids.

250
00:15:49.783 --> 00:15:51.242
I just can't picture anyone

251
00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.119

of them as me.

amazing for them

reading an actual book.

with the main plot. but--

says to the zookeeper.

how dare you throw
mud on me like that?!

wrote other stories.

I would check it out.

These are your books?

Well. yeah. but I haven't
written in a while.

standing in the home

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:36.420
Grace. um...

356
00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:39.423
I don't know if I really
need someone full-time.

357
00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:41.968
but I definitely need
some help next week

358
00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:43.385
if you're up for it.

359
00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:45.096
because I'm
starting a new book.

360
00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:46.764
Are you serious?

361
00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:49.892
That would be incredible.

362
00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.103
If you need to look
for something more full-time.

363
00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.604
I totally understand.

364
00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:55.689
No. no. no. this is perfect.

365
00:21:55.731 --> 00:21:57.691
-Okay. great!
-Thank you!

366
00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:58.985
Oh. thank you so much!

367
00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:01.779
[laughs]
Okay.

368
00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:03.405
Well.

369
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.992
I will see you on Monday.

370
00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.451
See you on Monday. Thank you.

371
00:22:07.493 --> 00:22:09.703
You're welcome!
[laughs]

372
00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:11.789
[sigh of relief]

373
00:22:39.275 --> 00:22:42.486
[no audible dialogue]

374
00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:53.622
She can't be real.

375
00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:56.292
I need to get me one of those.

376
00:22:56.334 --> 00:22:59.086
Oh. don't get too excited.
I only have her a week.

377
00:23:01.047 --> 00:23:03.341
She's cute. though.

378
00:23:03.381 --> 00:23:04.591
Hello.

379
00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:05.968
Mom. can we
go swimming. please?

380
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.887
-Yeah. please. can we go?
-Please?

381
00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:10.181
I can take them. if you'd like.

382
00:23:12.766 --> 00:23:15.144
-Okay. Yes. okay.
-Yes!

383
00:23:15.186 --> 00:23:16.979
-[kids laugh]
-Oh. my. oh. my.

384
00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:18.814
Grace. do you want to
borrow a suit?

385
00:23:18.856 --> 00:23:20.900
I have one if you want to
try one of mine.

386
00:23:20.941 --> 00:23:23.986
-Yeah. that'd be great.
-[Mary] Okay.

387
00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:47.509
Would you like a cover-up?

388
00:23:47.551 --> 00:23:50.012
-Yeah.
-[laughs] Here you go.

389
00:23:50.054 --> 00:23:51.722
Thank you.

390
00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:55.101
-Let me help.
-Yeah.

391
00:23:55.142 --> 00:23:56.310
[laughs]

392
00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:58.896
[Grace]
Whoa!

393
00:24:16.122 --> 00:24:19.375
The only one-piece you have.
and it just happens to be

394
00:24:19.417 --> 00:24:22.002
from the cover of
a Playboy swimsuit magazine?

395
00:24:22.044 --> 00:24:24.713
Oh. listen. I do not
need to worry about her.

396
00:24:24.755 --> 00:24:26.132
She is a prude!

397
00:24:26.173 --> 00:24:28.384
And you know what they say
about prudes.

398
00:24:34.681 --> 00:24:36.642
I have nothing to
worry about with her.

399
00:24:36.683 --> 00:24:38.894
I mean. if anything.
she needs my help.

400
00:24:42.356 --> 00:24:44.108
Hey. babe!

401
00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:47.153
Hey. nice to meet you. I'm Tom.

402
00:24:51.907 --> 00:24:54.076
[Tom] I'm gonna go change

[Mary]
Bye. sweetheart.

404
00:25:14.596 --> 00:25:15.806
I'll see you tomorrow!

405

406
00:25:19.393 --> 00:25:21.145

00:25:21.187 --> 00:25:23.939
[chuckles]
Well. what is this?

408
00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:26.608
Well. you tell me.

409
00:25:28.402 --> 00:25:30.821
[stammers]
I don't-- I don't know.

410
00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:37.744
-Mmm.

-[kisses]
-[chuckles]

413
00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:47.171
When's the last time
we did it in the kitchen?

414
00:25:47.213 --> 00:25:48.464
Oh. my.

415
00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:54.594
[moans]

416
00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:56.972
Mm. mm! Wow!

417
00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:01.477
-Mm. Right?
-Uh-huh.

418
00:26:06.273 --> 00:26:07.483
Come. come. come.

419

423
00:27:00.077 --> 00:27:01.454
Hi!

424
00:27:01.495 --> 00:27:03.247
If it's fine with you guys.

425
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:05.665
I'd like to get them in the
shower and ready for bed?

426
00:27:05.707 --> 00:27:07.501
Oh. no. no. that's okay.
I'll do it.

427
00:27:07.543 --> 00:27:09.836
No. no. That sounds great.

428
00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:11.380
Thanks.

429
00:27:11.422 --> 00:27:13.549
Okay. Okay. great.
Come on. guys. let's go.

430
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:15.050
Yeah.

[chuckles]

432
00:27:19.513 --> 00:27:21.723
I have my girlfriend back. huh?

433
00:27:21.765 --> 00:27:23.976
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm!
-Pretty fun.

434
00:27:25.144 --> 00:27:26.353
Mmm.

435
00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:35.613
[water running]

436
00:27:35.653 --> 00:27:37.697
Okay. Okay. guys.
come on in.

437
00:27:39.699 --> 00:27:41.160
Okay?

438
00:27:42.286 --> 00:27:43.996
Ahh. yes.

439
00:27:44.037 --> 00:27:46.039
Mm. I am impressed.

440
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:47.749
-Not bad. right?
-Mm-hmm.

441
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:53.464
Oh. Grace.

442
00:27:53.506 --> 00:27:55.966
You wanna join us
for dinner. maybe?

443
00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:57.593
Oh. that's so kind.

444
00:27:57.635 --> 00:27:59.052
But I'm a firm believer

445
00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:01.013
that this is important
family time.

446
00:28:01.054 --> 00:28:04.642
They're in their room.
playing. ready for bed.

447
00:28:04.682 --> 00:28:07.394
-Today was so fun.
-[Mary laughs]

448
00:28:07.436 --> 00:28:09.146
See you first thing
in the morning?

449
00:28:09.188 --> 00:28:10.856
Yes. thank you so much. Grace.

450
00:28:10.897 --> 00:28:13.192
-Okay. thanks. Good night.
-[Mary] Good night.

451

[sighs]

452
00:28:17.571 --> 00:28:20.115
[giggles]
What?

453
00:28:21.867 --> 00:28:23.743
[laughs]

454
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:30.459

455
00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:41.887
-Hi!
-[Grace] Hi.

456
00:28:41.928 --> 00:28:43.722
I brought you some goodies.

457
00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:46.517
Grace. you did
not have to do this.

458
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:49.019
You don't have to take care
of the kids and me.

459
00:28:49.061 --> 00:28:51.021
I know. but I like to.

460
00:28:51.063 --> 00:28:52.690
Please let me.

461
00:28:54.024 --> 00:28:56.276
Okay! It's adorable.

462
00:28:56.318 --> 00:28:58.612
Today's goal is the kitchen.

463
00:28:58.654 --> 00:28:59.779
tomorrow is the office.

464
00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:01.615
[Mary]
Wow!

465
00:29:01.657 --> 00:29:03.283
You are a godsend.

466
00:29:03.325 --> 00:29:04.577
[laughs]

467
00:29:12.792 --> 00:29:14.211
Mmm.

468

[Mary screaming]

470
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:45.701
Ooh! Ah!

471
00:29:45.743 --> 00:29:47.827
Ah! Ooh.

472
00:29:47.869 --> 00:29:49.705
Thank you. Grace.

473
00:29:51.457 --> 00:29:54.167
Ugh. I don't usually take
a bath at 11:00 in the morning.

474
00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:55.711
but I just thought
maybe it would

475
00:29:55.753 --> 00:29:57.379
get the ideas flowing.
you know?

476
00:29:58.964 --> 00:30:00.173
Ah.

477
00:30:01.592 --> 00:30:02.801
Ow! Ooh!

478
00:30:02.842 --> 00:30:04.511
Eee!

479
00:30:05.638 --> 00:30:06.846
[sighs]

480
00:30:17.983 --> 00:30:20.193
You know what I think
we should do today?

481
00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:22.028
Play hooky.

482
00:30:23.071 --> 00:30:24.323
But what about--

483
00:30:24.364 --> 00:30:25.949
It'll all be here
when we get back.

484
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.160
Come on.

485
00:30:30.203 --> 00:30:33.165
-[Mary] Here we are!

[pop music playing

487
00:30:34.916 --> 00:30:37.919
Oh. this is too much. really.

488
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:40.005
No. Grace. you deserve it!

489
00:30:41.298 --> 00:30:43.550
[Mary]
Um. excuse me.

490
00:30:43.592 --> 00:30:46.470
Could you fit my young friend
here for a new bra?

491
00:30:46.512 --> 00:30:48.221
Oh. no problem.
follow me this way.

492
00:30:48.263 --> 00:30:49.556
Okay.

493
00:30:56.438 --> 00:30:58.357
Okay. Be right back.

494
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.361
-[laughs]
-I'm excited!

495
00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:04.863
Me. too.

496
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.451
[sales woman]
All right. here's a few.

497
00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:11.077
Excellent.

498
00:31:11.119 --> 00:31:13.121
Let me know if you
need anything else. okay?

499
00:31:13.163 --> 00:31:14.623
Thank you.

500
00:31:14.665 --> 00:31:16.583
Let's try this one.
it's so pretty!

501
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:19.878
How does this feel?
Let's have a look.

502
00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:21.171
Um...

503
00:31:21.213 --> 00:31:23.465
-Oh!
-It's a little tight.

504
00:31:23.507 --> 00:31:25.133
It's so lovely. though!

505
00:31:25.175 --> 00:31:26.259
Here. let me adjust it.

506
00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:27.594
That's good.

507
00:31:27.636 --> 00:31:29.929
It's so pretty!

508
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.350
Oh. that's so nice.

509
00:31:33.392 --> 00:31:34.560
Better.

510
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:36.019
-Yay!
-[laughs]

511
00:31:36.061 --> 00:31:37.396
Okay. let's try one more.

512
00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:39.398
-Okay.
-Here. let's try this one.

513
00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:43.985
Okay. so this...

514
00:31:44.027 --> 00:31:45.779
Let me get it for you?

515
00:31:47.113 --> 00:31:49.825
There you go.
This one is a front closure.

516
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:52.786
Let me help you.

517
00:31:52.828 --> 00:31:55.288
Oh.

518
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.583
I remember when mine
used to look like this.

519
00:31:57.624 --> 00:31:59.167
[laughs]

520
00:31:59.209 --> 00:32:01.670
I never understood why
anyone wanted to go bigger.

521
00:32:01.712 --> 00:32:03.756
I can barely
keep these in order.

522
00:32:05.048 --> 00:32:06.966
I agree. totally. yes.

523
00:32:08.385 --> 00:32:10.387
There. Wow!

524
00:32:12.723 --> 00:32:14.057
Turn around.

525
00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:16.560
Have you ever heard the phrase.

526
00:32:16.602 --> 00:32:19.438
"Youth is wasted on the young"?

527
00:32:19.479 --> 00:32:21.690
That's how I feel about me.
I wish...

528
00:32:21.732 --> 00:32:24.150
that when I was young.
I had spent more time

529
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:26.069
just feeling good about my body

530
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:29.448
rather than worrying about all
of my perceived shortcomings.

531
00:32:29.489 --> 00:32:30.866
[chuckles]

532
00:32:30.908 --> 00:32:32.284
This looks lovely.

533
00:32:35.621 --> 00:32:37.623
In case you wanted to remember.

534
00:32:38.998 --> 00:32:40.459

535
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.835
Um. yes?

536
00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:43.253
How we doing in there. ladies?

537
00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:45.589
Great. Some of these

Great. good to hear.

[Mary]
All right!

540
00:32:51.595 --> 00:32:53.221
Also. I have all these clothes

541
00:32:53.263 --> 00:32:54.848
that I don't really
wear anymore.

542
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.224
So. why don't you try 'em on.

543
00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:57.392
see if anything fits.

544
00:32:57.434 --> 00:32:59.102
-Okay.
-Okay!

545
00:33:05.108 --> 00:33:07.193
-Honey?
-Hmm?

546
00:33:07.235 --> 00:33:09.988
What do you think about
women who get plastic surgery?

547
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:12.449
What do you mean. fake boobs?

548
00:33:12.491 --> 00:33:15.076
-I mean--
-Mm. maybe something else.

549
00:33:16.745 --> 00:33:18.872
Like a fake butt?
[chuckles]

550
00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:21.374
-I love your ass.
-You sure?

551
00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:24.294
-Yeah.
-I don't know. though.

552
00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:26.463
I mean. maybe I
ought to consider it.

553
00:33:28.256 --> 00:33:31.760
You know. it's not like I'm..

554
00:33:31.802 --> 00:33:33.720
thirty-five anymore.

555
00:33:35.138 --> 00:33:37.557
Maybe. just.

556
00:33:37.599 --> 00:33:40.143
you know. like. a little nip.

557
00:33:40.185 --> 00:33:42.103
a little tuck. like a little...

558
00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:44.314
something.
What do you think?

559
00:33:47.693 --> 00:33:49.486
You know what
really gets me off?

560
00:33:50.654 --> 00:33:52.322
What I find most exciting?

561
00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:55.033
Your brilliance.

562
00:33:56.827 --> 00:33:58.453
You're not only
hot and perfect.

563
00:33:58.495 --> 00:34:00.664
you're the most amazing mother
to our children.

564
00:34:00.706 --> 00:34:04.167
and you have the most
creative and intuitive mind

565
00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:06.003
that I've ever interacted with.

566
00:34:06.044 --> 00:34:08.129
I have the pleasure of
living with that mind

567
00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:09.297
every day of my life.

568
00:34:09.339 --> 00:34:10.632

569
00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:12.885
Mmm. really?

570
00:34:12.926 --> 00:34:15.261
Yes. really.

571
00:34:20.851 --> 00:34:22.227
-Oh!
-Sorry!

572
00:34:22.268 --> 00:34:23.729
I don't mean to interrupt.

573
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.939
I just wanted to
let you know. Mary.

574
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:28.191
that I'm gonna be in
a little late tomorrow.

575
00:34:28.233 --> 00:34:29.693
I have a doctor's appointment.

576
00:34:29.735 --> 00:34:32.070
-Okay.
-The kids are in bed. asleep.

577
00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:33.822
Thanks. good night.

578
00:34:33.864 --> 00:34:35.574
All right. good night.

[Kioki]
Mary. what do you think?

588
00:37:34.377 --> 00:37:36.171
I'm sorry. what?

589
00:37:37.463 --> 00:37:40.133
Of the mother being the killer
in the end?

590
00:37:43.803 --> 00:37:48.016
You want our hero to
suddenly become the villain?

591
00:37:48.058 --> 00:37:50.268
That's your idea of a twist?

592
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:52.395
I mean. it's on point

593
00:37:52.437 --> 00:37:54.480
with where everything's
headed right now.

594
00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:55.815
On trend. don't you think?

595
00:37:55.857 --> 00:37:57.943
Yes! Take this woman.

596
00:37:57.984 --> 00:37:59.903
who we made into a hero and--

597
00:37:59.945 --> 00:38:02.405
Flip it. Make her
the anti-hero.

598
00:38:02.447 --> 00:38:05.033
That's not actually
the way it works.

599
00:38:05.075 --> 00:38:06.785
I like it.

600
00:38:06.826 --> 00:38:08.703
Just a thought.

601
00:38:08.745 --> 00:38:10.247
You're the professional.

602
00:38:10.288 --> 00:38:12.958
We trust you. You'll
come up with something.

603
00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:14.459
Always do.

604
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.877
Are there any other notes

605
00:38:15.919 --> 00:38:17.754
we want to give Mary
while we're here?

606
00:38:17.796 --> 00:38:19.965
I love how you
paint your characters.

607
00:38:20.006 --> 00:38:21.674
your descriptions. the world.

608
00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:23.718
You're excellent at this. Mary.

609
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.971
Just think there's
a real opportunity here

610
00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:28.473
for you to explore
her darker side.

611
00:38:28.514 --> 00:38:31.434
She's longing for
something more.

612
00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:35.272
Your words are so vivid
on the page...

613
00:38:58.377 --> 00:39:01.965
...think if you could somehow
weave this into her back story.

614
00:39:02.007 --> 00:39:04.676
then you would have
something truly special.

615
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:07.553
Okay.

616
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.889
All right.

617
00:39:11.808 --> 00:39:13.185
[Mary exhales]

618
00:39:14.602 --> 00:39:17.147
Have you ever been
attracted to a woman before?

619
00:39:20.399 --> 00:39:21.901
Are you sure? Think about it.

620
00:39:21.943 --> 00:39:23.402
No. [laughs]

621
00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:26.156
It could all be in your head.

622
00:39:26.198 --> 00:39:28.325
A subconscious fantasy.

623
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:30.243
It's like. one minute

624
00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:32.912
she's like this innocent
young child. you know?

625
00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:37.042
Then the next minute. it's like
she's this master seductress

626
00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:39.711
and I'm just her lap dog
waiting for the next treat.

627
00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:43.215
Honestly. you're
probably just sex starved.

628
00:39:43.256 --> 00:39:46.592
No. no.
[whispers] Tom is amazing!

629
00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:48.594
No complaints there.

630
00:39:51.014 --> 00:39:55.643
I mean. in this strange.
sexual servant type of way.

631
00:39:55.685 --> 00:39:58.897
I feel like she would do
whatever I asked her to do.

632
00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:00.648
To me.

633
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.235
That's bad of me
to think like that. isn't it?

634
00:40:03.276 --> 00:40:06.905
Careful. love.
maybe this is her plan.

635
00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:08.656
Get you hooked on her so that

636
00:40:08.698 --> 00:40:11.951
she can overthrow your kingdom
and take everything in it.

637
00:40:13.245 --> 00:40:14.453
Really?

638
00:40:14.495 --> 00:40:16.039
[laughs] No. I'm just kidding.

639
00:40:16.081 --> 00:40:18.791
I told you. strange things
happen when I write.

640
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:20.293
I'll say.

641
00:40:20.335 --> 00:40:22.545
Make her your muse. then.

642
00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:24.839
Use her and this thing
and write about it.

643
00:40:24.881 --> 00:40:26.966
You said you're having
writer's block. right?

644
00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:28.801
-Yeah.
-You're already paying for her.

Yep. my grandpa always said

650
00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:45.526
I was the grandson
he always wanted.

651

make you horny again?

-Yeah.

1071
01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:24.739
I think I'm just gonna
go lay down. okay?

1072
01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.157
I'll get you some water.

1073
01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.034
[Mary]
Thanks. honey.

1074
01:11:28.076 --> 01:11:30.453
Hey. guys. how was the park?

1075
01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:32.747
[groans]

1076
01:11:37.127 --> 01:11:38.544
[Tom]
Here you go.

1077
01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:39.921
I love you. babe.

1078
01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:42.381
Mm. love you more.

1079
01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.012
[sighs]

1080
01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:50.473
Tom.

1081
01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.503
[Grace. distant]
Not that hard. you idiot!

1082
01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:23.756
[indistinct distant yelling]

1083
01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:29.220
[Grace moans]

1084
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.601
[Tom and Grace moaning]

1085
01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:45.320
[moaning continues]

1086
01:12:49.991 --> 01:12:51.534
[Grace]
Slower!

1087
01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:54.745
[Tom and Grace
breathing heavily]

1088
01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:57.790
[Grace]
There.

1089
01:12:57.832 --> 01:12:59.334
Oh. that's it.

1090
01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:03.838
[both panting. moaning]

1091
01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:06.966
[Grace] Now!

1092
01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:20.479
Oh. that's a good boy.

1093
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:30.531
Who's in charge?

1094
01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.869
I said. who's in charge

1095
01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:37.747
and will always be in charge?!

1096
01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.674
[Grace]
Don't worry.

1097
01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:50.593
she won't remember any of this.

1098
01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:22.041
[Tom]
You feeling better?

1099
01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.960
Yeah. sort of. yeah.

1100
01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:26.212
Just had a horrible dream.

1101
01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:30.300
Sam. Alex. time for dinner.

1102
01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.512
Come on. take your seat.

1103
01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.098
No more video games.

1104
01:14:40.684 --> 01:14:42.937
Well. as long as you
survived your dream.

1105
01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:44.272
that's all that matters.

1106
01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:51.154
[Mary]
Um. Grace. uh...

1107
01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:55.241
I seem to remember
you saying that

1108
01:14:55.283 --> 01:14:57.660
this was sacred family time.

1109
01:14:57.701 --> 01:14:59.078
So...

1110
01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.580
what the hell are you
still doing here?

1111
01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:04.041
[Tom] What are you saying?
What are you talking about?

1112
01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.501
Um. she's right.

1113
01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:08.879
Must have been
a pretty awful dream.

1114
01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:11.299
Teacher says a bad dream
is actually a nightmare.

1115
01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:13.550
You and my husband

1116
01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:15.136
-were fucking!
-[Tom] Mary!

1117
01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:17.054
Over there. on the counter!

1118
01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:18.722
-Damn it!
-It was so real!

1119
01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:20.350
It was so real!

1120
01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:22.518
And you were like
a totally different person.

1121
01:15:22.559 --> 01:15:23.894
you were like somebody else.

1122
01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:26.189
[Alex]
Daddy. Mommy's scaring me.

1123
01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:27.690
[Tom]
I know honey.

1124
01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:29.150
Mommy's not feeling very well.

1125
01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:31.027
I think you need to
go back and rest.

1126
01:15:31.068 --> 01:15:33.237
[crying]
You guys. I'm sorry.

1127
01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:35.739
I'm really sorry.

1128
01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:39.660
When Mommy writes.

1129
01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:43.164
sometimes the things
in her mind are so vivid

1130
01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:45.791
that she can't tell
the difference between

1131
01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:48.752
the imaginary and the real.

1132
01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.760
What happened to you
out there?

1133
01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:58.637
[Mary]
I don't know.

1134
01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:00.973
I'm not really sure.

1135
01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:10.900
[sighs]
Actually--

1136
01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:15.321
I do know. actually.

1137
01:16:16.364 --> 01:16:17.823
You know that nightmare?

1138
01:16:19.616 --> 01:16:21.952
That's really
how I feel about us.

1139
01:16:21.994 --> 01:16:23.538
That's how I feel about you.

1140
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.456
that's how I feel
about everything.

1141
01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:28.501
Because for the longest time.

1142
01:16:28.543 --> 01:16:31.462
I've just been
sitting in the backseat

1143
01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:33.506
and I've been
letting you drive.

1144
01:16:33.548 --> 01:16:34.840
And I've been supporting you

1145
01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:37.510
in everything that
you wanted to do.

1146
01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:41.514
And I've been taking all of my
energies and all of my talents.

1147
01:16:41.556 --> 01:16:43.682
and pouring them into you

1148
01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:46.727
and into the kids
and into this life.

1149
01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:49.939
Because I wanted to
build something together.

1150
01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:52.442
And what do I get for it?!

1151
01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:54.651
What do I get for it?!

1152
01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:56.487
Fucking screwed!

1153
01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:58.697
You betrayed me!

1154
01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:00.616
-You crash us into a wall
-Come on. Mary--

1155
01:17:00.657 --> 01:17:02.159
-and then. and then
-Mary--

1156
01:17:02.201 --> 01:17:05.204
you expect me
to pick up the pieces

1157
01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:06.914
and make everything
better again!

1158
01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.624
-Mary. I'm sorry.
-No!

1159
01:17:08.665 --> 01:17:10.418
-Come here.
-No. don't comfort me!

1160
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.961
-Come here.
-Don't comfort me!

1161
01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:13.463
I'm sorry!

1162
01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:15.256
I'm sorry. I fucked up.

1163
01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.967
But you're my world.
you're everything to me.

1164
01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:19.676
You and the twins.

1165
01:17:22.597 --> 01:17:25.099
I want to find a way
to make it up to you.

1166
01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:26.934
I promise. I will.

1167
01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:29.228
And you're right.
we're never gonna

1168
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:32.064
-live like that again.
-No! You're damn straight!

1169
01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:33.566
Yeah.

1170
01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:36.611
-You mean everything to me.
-[sniffs]

1171
01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:39.530
Come on. You're almost through.

1172
01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:41.616
Just let's not let this thing

1173
01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:44.410
kill us on the way out.

1174
01:17:44.452 --> 01:17:47.371
-All right. Yeah. [sniffs]
-Okay?

1175
01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:20.571
[laughter echoes]

1176
01:20:44.298 --> 01:20:47.426
-Happy anniversary.
-Happy anniversary.

1177
01:20:52.931 --> 01:20:54.850
I'm gonna head in early today.

1178
01:20:54.891 --> 01:20:57.144
-Rendezvous tonight?
-Yeah.

1179
01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.114
[Mary into phone]
Oh. hi. this is Mary Morrison.

1180
01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:12.368
I'm calling about a check
that I sent in a while ago.

1181
01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:14.578
but it seems like it
hasn't been deposited yet.

1182
01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:16.288
[woman]
Oh. hi. Mrs. Morrison.

1183
01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:17.748
I've been meaning to call you.

1184
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:20.417
Yes. I have your check
right here.

1185
01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:22.252
I was just waiting to hear

1186
01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:24.463
which caregiver
you want to go with.

1187
01:21:25.715 --> 01:21:26.965
What?

1188
01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:29.051
I should have
called you sooner.

1189
01:21:29.092 --> 01:21:30.969
I'm sorry.
we've been terribly busy.

1190
01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:33.514
Um...

1191
01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:38.435
[quietly]
Grace.

1192
01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:40.020
You have a Grace. right?

1193
01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:43.982
Sorry. we don't have
anybody by that name.

1194
01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:47.069
Mary?

1195
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:49.655
Um. okay. thank you.

1196
01:21:49.697 --> 01:21:52.032
Thank you so much.
Thank you for letting me know

1197
01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:55.369
that it will be deposited soon.
Okay. bye-bye.

1198
01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.331
I was thinking of changing
the master bedroom sheets.

1199
01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:01.250
Since it's your anniversary.

1200
01:22:04.253 --> 01:22:05.880
Yes. of course.

1201
01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:07.798
Grace. I--

1202
01:22:09.091 --> 01:22:11.385
I just want to apologize
about last night.

1203
01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:14.889
I really don't know
what came over me.

1204
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.932
I think I had a fever.

1205
01:22:16.973 --> 01:22:18.601
I understand.

1206
01:22:18.642 --> 01:22:21.520
Nightmares can feel so real
sometimes.

1207
01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:35.117
If this were a library.
I would check it out.

1208
01:22:35.158 --> 01:22:36.952
[Mary]
Well. if you like that one.

1209
01:22:36.993 --> 01:22:38.579
follow me.

1210
01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:57.765
She's your best friend and you
don't even know her last name?

1211
01:22:57.807 --> 01:22:59.809
I do know a book
she checked out recently

1212
01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:02.812
is Laddie. by
Gene Stratton-Porter.

1213
01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:04.146
Ah.

1214
01:23:04.187 --> 01:23:05.815
[typing]

1215
01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:13.864
The only person
to check out Laddie

1216
01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:16.492
in the last three months.

1217
01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:18.911
Elaine. please.
please call me back.

1218
01:23:18.953 --> 01:23:20.537
I need to talk to you.

1219
01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:23.039
[sighs]

1220
01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:54.112
[buzzes]

1221
01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:02.078
[knocks]
Elaine?

1222
01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.580
[latch clicks]

1223
01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:08.335
Oh! Thank God. here you are!

1224
01:24:08.377 --> 01:24:09.628
I've been trying to call you!

1225
01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:11.588
You would not believe--
[gasps]

1226
01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:23.642
[gasps. screams]

1227
01:24:23.684 --> 01:24:25.268
Oh. my God!

1228
01:24:28.355 --> 01:24:30.357
[gasping]

1229
01:24:32.902 --> 01:24:35.988
Ah! Oh! 911!

1230
01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:37.781
Please hurry!

1231
01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:40.158
Please come! Oh. my God!

1232
01:24:51.962 --> 01:24:53.213
[distant sirens]

1233
01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:01.179
[crying]

1234
01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:05.851
Mrs. Morrison.

1235
01:25:05.893 --> 01:25:07.978
Would you mind
coming down to the station

1236
01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.145
to answer a few questions?

1237
01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:11.815
Of course.
whatever you need.

1238
01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:14.359
Your husband's going to
meet us there. okay?

1239
01:25:14.401 --> 01:25:16.319
-Okay.
-Okay.

1240
01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:34.797
[officer] Pretty much
an open and shut case.

1241
01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:38.675
[officer #2 sighs]

1242
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:44.347
So... a writer. then.

1243
01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:47.977
Mm-hmm. yes.
Yes. I'm a writer. Um...

1244
01:25:48.018 --> 01:25:50.938
Is my husband here yet?
I'd really love to see him.

1245
01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.689
He's on his way. Mrs. Morrison.

1246
01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:54.399
In the meantime.

1247
01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:56.944
you mind telling me
what medications you're taking?

1248
01:25:56.986 --> 01:25:59.613
Any kind of psychosis you
may have been diagnosed with?

1249
01:26:00.781 --> 01:26:02.032
Wh-What?

1250
01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:04.868
What is this?

1251
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:06.662
We have footage of you. Mary.

1252
01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:08.664
Early this morning.
around 1:00 am.

1253
01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:11.041
driving to the location
of the deceased.

1254
01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:14.294
That's not possible.

1255
01:26:14.336 --> 01:26:16.922
And the deceased is my friend
and her name is Elaine.

1256
01:26:16.964 --> 01:26:19.091
We also have a witness.
a neighbor of yours.

1257
01:26:19.133 --> 01:26:21.468
saying you and Elaine were
in some sort of argument

1258
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:23.219
yesterday evening
outside your home.

1259
01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:25.430
Do I need a lawyer present?
Because I thought I was

1260
01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:27.975
just coming here to help you
with the investigation.

1261
01:26:28.017 --> 01:26:30.686
And we have your fingerprints
on the murder weapon.

1262
01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:32.771
The scissors Elaine
were stabbed with.

1263
01:26:32.813 --> 01:26:34.648
That's just not possible.

1264
01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:39.695
Mary. the evidence
is all pointing one way.

1265
01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:41.697
You either tell me something
I don't know.

1266
01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:43.406
or I'll lay it out for you.

1267
01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:02.592
That could be anyone.

1268
01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:04.761
We found this too.
among your belongings

1269
01:27:04.803 --> 01:27:06.346
hidden in your writer's room.

1270
01:27:06.388 --> 01:27:08.765
Too many similarities
between this made up story

1271
01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:11.393
and the one going on
in real life. wouldn't you say?

1272
01:27:11.434 --> 01:27:13.520
No. this does not make sense!

1273
01:27:13.562 --> 01:27:16.356
Anyone else have access
to your work. Mrs. Morrison?

1274
01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:19.026
Yes. of course. my publisher.

1275
01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:23.321
-My husband.
-You're so hot.

1276
01:27:23.363 --> 01:27:25.448
Oh. and our nanny. Grace.

1277
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:28.577
[door opens]
Mary. don't say another word.

1278
01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:32.455
Oh. babe.

1279
01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:36.877
Honey. I'm so sorry.

1280
01:27:36.919 --> 01:27:39.088
It's all right. we're gonna
figure this out.

1281
01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:40.589
How is Rick doing?

1282
01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:43.967
He's in shock.

1283
01:27:44.009 --> 01:27:45.928
He doesn't think
you did it. either.

1284
01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:52.142
I don't understand
how I'm the main suspect.

1285
01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:54.603
Well. they don't have enough
evidence to hold you.

1286
01:27:54.644 --> 01:27:56.146
But what--

1287
01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:58.398
What about the fingerprints
on the scissors?

1288
01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.068
Well. my fingerprints
are on them. too.

1289
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:03.403
The kids' fingerprints
are on the scissors.

1290
01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:05.739
[sighs]

1291
01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:11.245
Mary. where. um--

1292
01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:13.496
Where--
Where were you last night?

1293
01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:18.334
I-I got up to smoke...

1294
01:28:18.376 --> 01:28:21.463
and then I saw that the light
was on in my writer's room.

1295
01:28:21.504 --> 01:28:22.965
so I went there to check.

1296
01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:25.008
But nobody was there.

1297
01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:28.720
and I locked it up
and then I came back to bed.

1298
01:28:32.766 --> 01:28:34.517
-You didn't go anywhere else?
-Mm-mm.

1299
01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:36.436
After you checked the house.
you didn't--

1300
01:28:36.478 --> 01:28:38.647
No. No. honey.

1301
01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:41.024
You were gone
for nearly three hours.

1302
01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.909
Honey. really.
I came right back to bed.

1303
01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:52.619
You believe me. don't you?

1304
01:28:55.413 --> 01:28:57.582
The slashed tires on the bike--

1305
01:28:59.417 --> 01:29:01.920
They found a Swiss Army knife
in the garage

1306
01:29:01.962 --> 01:29:04.714
and the blade matches
the markings on the bike tire.

1307
01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:07.592
And yours are the only
fingerprints on that knife.

1308
01:29:12.139 --> 01:29:13.307
[clicks]

1309
01:29:20.772 --> 01:29:22.357
When was the last time

1310
01:29:22.398 --> 01:29:24.609
you were at Elaine's office
for a session?

1311
01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:27.112
Years ago.

1312
01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:32.367
Well. they found
some handwritten note that...

1313
01:29:32.408 --> 01:29:33.785
seemed like a diagnosis.

1314
01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:35.996
or that it outlined
what you have.

1315
01:29:36.038 --> 01:29:38.748
That is the time that I met her
at the gym to work out.

1316
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:41.918
Those notes. they could be--
They could be about anyone.

1317
01:29:44.213 --> 01:29:45.505
I know.

1318
01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:56.892
[Grace. echoing]
Who would do such a thing?

1319
01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:19.413
Um...

1320
01:30:21.041 --> 01:30:22.458
Uh...

1321
01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.587
I've got to go to
the restroom. okay?

1322
01:30:29.966 --> 01:30:31.509
[footsteps fade]

1323
01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:41.519
[tires squeal]

1324
01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.211
[Tom] I told them
you went home to rest.

1325
01:31:06.253 --> 01:31:08.462
Really. I'm on my ass
wanting to speak to you.

1326
01:31:08.504 --> 01:31:10.048
Where are you?

1327
01:31:15.387 --> 01:31:17.973
If you need something.
if you're in trouble--

1328
01:31:18.014 --> 01:31:19.391
I love you.

1329
01:31:20.767 --> 01:31:22.894
[whispers]
We can get you out.

1330
01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:24.646
[normal voice]
Meet you at home.

1331
01:32:10.192 --> 01:32:11.525

[knocks]

1335
01:32:34.257 --> 01:32:36.426
[woman]
I'm not buying anything.

1336
01:32:39.429 --> 01:32:41.806
There's no point
in standing there.

1337
01:32:41.848 --> 01:32:44.684
I'm sorry. ma'am.
I'm not selling anything.

1338
01:32:44.726 --> 01:32:46.769
I was just hoping
I could talk to you.

1339
01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:48.188
It's about Grace Taylor.

1340
01:32:48.230 --> 01:32:50.899
[woman]
Yeah? What about her?

1341
01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:53.693
I'm her aunt.

1342
01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:56.696
Oh. um. I just drove
two hours to get here.

1343
01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:58.823
would it be okay.
I really need a restroom.

1344
01:32:58.865 --> 01:33:00.075
Could I come in?

1345
01:33:03.036 --> 01:33:04.037
Thank you so much.

1346
01:33:04.079 --> 01:33:05.288
[woman]
Through there.

1347
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:06.915
Okay. thank you.

1348
01:33:25.725 --> 01:33:28.562
I don't know what she wants.
Something about Grace.

1349
01:33:28.602 --> 01:33:30.939
[deep voice] What the hell
you let her in for.

1350
01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:32.815
for heaven sakes!

1351
01:33:35.026 --> 01:33:36.361
[door opens]

1352
01:33:43.993 --> 01:33:46.955
I am so sorry that I
just showed up like this.

1353
01:33:46.996 --> 01:33:49.707
It's just that I'm
Grace's employer.

1354
01:33:49.749 --> 01:33:51.209
She looks after my children.

1355
01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:53.044
I was hoping that
maybe you could help

1356
01:33:53.086 --> 01:33:54.963
answer a few questions
about her?

1357
01:33:58.007 --> 01:34:00.302
You're not from around here.
are you?

1358
01:34:01.844 --> 01:34:05.014
[deep voice groans]
Christ.

1359
01:34:05.056 --> 01:34:08.101
Here we go again.

[sighs]

1362
01:34:13.982 --> 01:34:16.692
My Grace was one of the oldest.

1363
01:34:16.734 --> 01:34:20.447
After her parents
were sent to prison

1364
01:34:20.489 --> 01:34:23.158
for nearly starving
their children to death.

1365
01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:26.578
and God knows whatever else
they did to those kids.

1366
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.788
she came here to live with me.

1367
01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:33.168
Last I heard. she got a job

1368
01:34:33.209 --> 01:34:35.462
at one of those
hoity-toity fitness clubs

1369

Ohh! That's a good boy.

[laughter echoes]

1381
01:35:15.627 --> 01:35:17.420
[Elaine]
This could be the perfect thing

1382
01:35:17.462 --> 01:35:19.088
to kick your ass out the door.

1383
01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:22.467
Use it as momentum
to enter into a new chapter

1384
01:35:22.509 --> 01:35:24.302
and to do the things
that you want to do.

1385
01:35:24.344 --> 01:35:28.056
so you can create the things
you want to create.

1387
01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:34.854
I'm telling you. Mary. this is

exactly what you need
to get through.

1389
01:35:45.156 --> 01:35:47.367
You have a lot going for you.

You are obviously a delightful
