[crew member]
Now they're ready.

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:13.638
[John]  Okay. I'm gonna do
some loosening-up exercises.

Okay.
Take to the left.

A double take to the right
and a double take to the left.

12
00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.814
Okay. let's work
on the eyebrows now.

13
00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.232
Ready?
Right eyebrow.

[Rosie]
Hello?

21
00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:41.207
[Tanner]  Ms. Shuster.
this is Tanner Colby

22
00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.500
calling about
the John Belushi interview.

23
00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.626
- [Rosie]  Yeah. hi.
- [line trilling]

24
00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:44.961
[Tanner]
Mr. Michaels. how are you?

25
00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.087
[Lorne]
Good.

26
00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.547
[interviewee]
Tanner Colby. can I ask you

27
00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.757
to call me back
in ten minutes?

28
00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:49.966
[Tanner]
That is not a problem.

29
00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.092
[interviewee]
Okay. thanks.

30
00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.844
How about some Brando?

31
00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.429
[as Marlon Brando]
You was my brother. Charley.

32
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.181
You should've taken care of me
or some'n.

33
00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.265
[laughter]

34
00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.768
Could've been a somebody.
Could've been a contender.

35
00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.936
[interviewee]  Are you taping
or making notes?

36
00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:03.521
[Tanner]  Uh. taping.
Is that okay?

37
00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.106
[interviewee]  You should always
ask permission

38
00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:05.940
before you tape.

39
00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:06.983
[Tanner]
Okay. May I tape?

40
00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.109
[interviewee]
Yes. you may.

41
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.360
[interviewee]
What are you doing?

42
00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.737
[Tanner]  It's gonna be like
an oral history

43
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:13.364
told in the words of the
first-person participants

44
00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.658
because no one's ever done
a real biography

45
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.368
of John as a performer.

46
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.953
You know.
when he showed up.

47
00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.414
it radically altered
the landscape of comedy.

48
00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.750
I just wanted to give more
of a full portrait of him

49
00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:24.667
as a human being.

50
00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:25.710
[interviewee]
Oh. okay.

51
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.045
[John]
No. no. no.

52
00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.505
[crew member]
Want to do Steiger quickly?

53
00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:30.715
[as Rod Steiger]
Terry. Terry. Terry.

54
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.133
what are you talking about?

55
00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.220
What are you talkin' about?

56
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.846
[laughter]

57
00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:39.974
Don't talk to me that way!

58
00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:43.311
[cheers and applause]

59
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.567
[person]  Give me a light.
Johnny.

60
00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.944
I'm going nuts. here.

61
00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:54.531
[Tom]  He was one of the most
lovable and tragic characters

62
00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:56.032
I've ever met.

63
00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.201
He could be completely kind

64
00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.496
and thoughtful and generous
and wonderful

65
00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:03.832
and. at the flipside
of the coin.

66
00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:07.210
be chaotic and tortured.
you know?

67
00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.796
He also was hilariously funny.

68
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.966
He just had
a sort of giant humanity

69
00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:16.219
that hooked into
the collective unconsciousness

70
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.054
of people's funny bone.

71
00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.932
[band playing
energetic blues music]

72
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.268
[John]
All right. all right.

73
00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.926
- [music stops]
- [cheers and applause]

74
00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:58.887
[Harold]
John always had appetites

75
00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:02.724
that were completely out
of control for everything.

76
00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:04.934
but I didn't start
to worry about him

77
00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.645
until they were
at the Universal Amphitheatre

78
00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.272
playing for 7.000 people.

79
00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.899
Thank you.

80
00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:16.029
[Harold]  I looked at John
on the stage. and I thought.

81
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.407
"He's on the most popular
comedy television show

82
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.742
of our generation"...

83
00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:22.911
Live from New York.
it's  Saturday Night!

84
00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:24.996
But. no!

85
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.290
I logged a lot miles
training for that day.

86
00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.292
and I downed
a lot of doughnuts.

87
00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:31.502
That's why
Little Chocolate Donuts

88
00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:34.172
have been at my training table
since I was a kid.

89
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:35.381
[laughter]

90
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:38.301
[Harold]  He's in the most
successful comedy film ever.

91
00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.428
[Babs]
This is absolutely gross.

92
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.806
That boy is a P-I-G. pig.

93
00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:47.810
See if you can guess
what I am now.

94
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.107
[Babs yelps]

95
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.152
I'm a zit.
Get it?

96
00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:59.906
[Harold]  And now he's onstage.
fronting an amazing band.

97
00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.075
suspenseful music

98
00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:05.245
My first thought was.
"How great for him."

99
00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.914
And my second thought was.

100
00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:10.750
knowing his appetites.

101
00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:13.002
"I don't think
he'll survive this."

102
00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:24.430
The Chips'
"Rubber Biscuit"

103
00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:27.558
energetic scatting

104
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.229
[Judy]  I was a sophomore
in high school.

105
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.233
and a bunch of the senior guys
gave us a ride home.

106
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.902
And that was
when I first met him.

107
00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.320
[coughs]
Hi.

108
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.450
[Judy]
My first date was homecoming.

109
00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.952
and he was homecoming king.

110
00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.413
That was a good introduction
to my life with John.

111
00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:50.790
because he has
to go dance with the queen...

112
00:04:50.832 --> 00:04:53.835
[laughs]  And I have to dance
with her boyfriend.

113
00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:55.211
[indistinct shouting]

114
00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.422
When I first was
getting involved with John.

115
00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:58.881
his passion was football.

116
00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:02.510
but he was beginning
to do things onstage.

117
00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:03.636
He did the varsity show.

118
00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:06.180
and he came up with lots
of little skits.

119
00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:07.390
like a little jug band.

120
00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:09.225
He had a vision of the show

121
00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:10.935
so he just grabbed
his friends

122
00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.979
and said.
"Here's what we're gonna do."

123
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:14.731
- And they did it.
- [laughter]

124
00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:17.817
His vehicle was a motorcycle
that he was very fond of.

125
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:19.652
He bought it on his own.

126
00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.529
I wasn't supposed
to ride on motorcycles.

127
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.073
so he would have to borrow
my parents' car to go out.

128
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:27.118
but I thought
it was very cool.

129
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.579
I did write a list of what
I wanted from a boyfriend.

130
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.748
'cause. you know. you have
to manifest these things.

131
00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.959
It was "good at sports. smart.

132
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.503
musical. and funny."

133
00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.422
And he was all those things.

134
00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.841
And. of course.
I thought he was Italian.

135
00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:43.509
as I think most people did.

136
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.636
I didn't know
where Albania was

137
00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:47.430
when he said he was Albanian.

138
00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:50.183
"Is that a country?"
I was like. "Albania?"

139
00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:53.686
And I think he always felt
that immigrant label

140
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.855
pretty strongly...

141
00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.483
that his family
were foreigners.

142
00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:01.694
[Agnes]  When we first moved
to Wheaton from Chicago.

143
00:06:01.736 --> 00:06:03.529
John was six years old.

144
00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:06.407
John lived in a world
of his own.

145
00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.453
He was just like a little man.
He just took care of himself.

146
00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:12.580
[Judy]  His father was
an Albanian immigrant.

147
00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:14.540
He was embarrassed
by the way he spoke.

148
00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:17.126
and he didn't express himself
at all.

149
00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:18.378
He wanted to be a cowboy.

150
00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.922
He wanted to come to America
and be a cowboy.

151
00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:23.716
[Sue]  John's family
was a mystery to us.

152
00:06:23.758 --> 00:06:27.136
None of us had ever heard
of Albania. God knows.

153
00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:30.556
He was very ashamed
of his home.

154
00:06:30.598 --> 00:06:35.228
and we never went
inside his house. ever.

155
00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.855
[Gus]  We all wanted
to be American.

156
00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:41.275
So. if your parents spoke
Albanian in the house.

157
00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:44.570
it was kind of embarrassing
to you.

158
00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.531
[Jim]  Well. you know.
he was kind of intense.

159
00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:47.865
you know.
around the house

160
00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:50.284
but around the dinner table
every once in a while.

161
00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:53.579
- he'd really let loose.
- [laughter]

162
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:55.706
He'd do impressions
of everything.

163
00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:57.667
[John imitating Brando]
Could've been a contender.

164
00:06:57.708 --> 00:07:00.545
[Jim]  He loved
to be a performer. you know?

165
00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.714
As a three-year-old kid.
he used to go the neighbor's.

166
00:07:03.756 --> 00:07:07.593
walk into a room.
and do a show.

167
00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:11.722
John just wanted
to make everyone laugh.

168
00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.599
Of course.
my dad didn't. like.

169
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:15.560
even see the humor in it.
you know?

170
00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.228
He'd just keep eating.

171
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.564
country music

172
00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.482
But the strong influence
in our house.

173
00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:24.777
that was my grandmother.
who didn't speak English.

174
00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.863
She loved John very much.

175
00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:28.698
"Johnny nunnas."
she used to say.

176
00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:30.450
She used to go.
"Johnny nunnas."

177
00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:31.617
I don't know what it means.

178
00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:34.620
but it sounds really warm.
you know?

179
00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:35.580
[alarm ringing]

180
00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.665
Well. I'm a king bee

181
00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:39.167
bluesy music

182
00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:41.878
Buzzing around your hive

183
00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.464
[Gus]  John's dad was
in the restaurant business

184
00:07:44.505 --> 00:07:47.550
and owned a restaurant
in Chicago.

185
00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.885
[Judy]
He stayed there. like.

186
00:07:48.926 --> 00:07:50.970
five nights a week
or something.

187
00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.847
Come back on the weekend.

188
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.516
His father was a serious guy.

189
00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.977
When he was young.
he started drinking.

190
00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:00.188
He was abusing it.
and he stopped.

191
00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.190
He did not drink.

192
00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:04.150
[Gus]
Really was a hardworking guy

193
00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:06.444
and away from the house a lot.

194
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.488
The idea was to get ahead.

195
00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.948
It was all
about the American dream.

196
00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:13.826
[Judy]
His mother.

197
00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.162
she worked in various
restaurants as well.

198
00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:18.039
She wasn't around a lot.

199
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.791
And she herself
had aspirations.

200
00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:21.918
She wanted to be an actress

201
00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:24.378
and actually ran away once
and did a play.

202
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:25.505
Like. left home.

203
00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:26.964
No one knew where she was.
[chuckles]  Showed up.

204
00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.342
she's got a little apartment
and doing a play.

205
00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:31.677
And then she came home.
and that was the end of that.

206
00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:34.347
I just thought
that she felt sad...

207
00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:36.933
[chuckles]
...that things hadn't gone

208
00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:38.726
how she would've liked.

209
00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:42.772
I don't think John's parents
really understood his essence.

210
00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:47.735
They didn't have the exchanges
with him to know it.

211
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.738
They didn't share
that kind of time.

212
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.866
It was Nana who provided
the unconditional love

213
00:08:53.908 --> 00:08:55.451
for the kids.

214
00:08:55.493 --> 00:08:57.912
- [record scratches]
- [laughter]

215
00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:01.624
[Jonathan Winters]  Oh. boy.
what a fun night to drive!

216
00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:04.126
[Marian]  He'd play the records
something like a million times

217
00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:05.670
until you go crazy.

218
00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:10.132
- [Jonathan imitates explosion]
- Boy. hit that semi dead-on.

219
00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:12.176
[Marian]  Jonathan Winters
and Bob Newhart.

220
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:15.137
[Jonathan]  You must've
been doing at least 65.

221
00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:17.557
I was doing 90. clown!

222
00:09:17.598 --> 00:09:20.017
[Marian]  And he'd imitate them
in the mirror.

223
00:09:20.059 --> 00:09:22.520
And then he'd write little
skit things off of it

224
00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:23.521
and do them.

225
00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:24.897
[John]
Special guest this morning.

226
00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.899
four-foot-two. 656-pound
Elsa Fattinsky.

227
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.317
[Marian]  And then once
he starting doing it.

228
00:09:28.359 --> 00:09:30.528
he said that he felt like
he could. you know.

229
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.363
go somewhere with this life.
you know?

230
00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:34.115
[John]  Earth tremors
were felt around the world

231
00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.700
to Schkorgus. New Jersey.

232
00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:38.661
[Marian]
And then in the band too.

233
00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:40.204
[Payne]
He had a band. you know?

234
00:09:40.246 --> 00:09:42.957
And he'd bring these kids.
anybody who could play.

235
00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:46.294
And he'd show up
with this whole mob of kids.

236
00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:48.337
That was the way he was.

237
00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.798
He would bring ten kids
with him.

238
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.091
rock music

239
00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:54.885
[Marian]  He felt like
he didn't have a family.

240
00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:58.431
so he tried to create his own.

241
00:09:58.472 --> 00:10:01.225
[Dick]  John was the star
of the class.

242
00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:04.312
He was so in control
when he was doing a play.

243
00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:05.813
and he was so funny.

244
00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.523
You just knew he was special.

245
00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:10.943
And when he found Judy
and they found each other.

246
00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:13.195
I mean. that was it.

247
00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:15.364
[Sue]
The John and Judy relationship

248
00:10:15.406 --> 00:10:17.116
is really one of those things

249
00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:19.452
that you hear about
in storybooks.

250
00:10:20.995 --> 00:10:22.622
[Judy]
From the time I first met him.

251
00:10:22.663 --> 00:10:23.789
it seemed like he was always

252
00:10:23.831 --> 00:10:27.168
leading me into new doors
and experiences.

253
00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:30.296
And it was like John had
some kind of magic.

254
00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.048
He attracted people.

255
00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:35.426
His enthusiasm was such
that you got revved up

256
00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:37.970
and then you wanted to do it
too. whatever it was.

257
00:10:40.181 --> 00:10:43.225
He decided to audition
for a summer stock theater

258
00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:44.352
in Indiana.

259
00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:46.437
I think he was
the youngest performer

260
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:47.938
they ever had who they paid.

261
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.692
I believe
he was paid $45 a week.

262
00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:55.154
and he was expected
to mow lawn and paint as well.

263
00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:56.697
[chuckles]

264
00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.328
[John]
Dear Jutes. well. here it is.

265
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.579
Twenty minutes to ten.

266
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:05.539
We're going through the
readings of our first play.

267
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:07.625
I don't have a real big part
in this one.

268
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.043
I play a general.

269
00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.878
This is really
Hicksville. USA.

270
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.505
I can't believe it.

271
00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:14.340
When I ride my bike in town.

272
00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:16.967
the local yokels think
I'm a Hells Angel.

273
00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:19.553
I'll write as often as I can.
sweetheart.

274
00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:20.888
You know what they say.

275
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.599
Absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

276
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.477
Your one and only. John B.

277
00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.645
Dear Jutes.

278
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:30.272
I'm listening to the Beatles
album  Sgt. Pepper.

279
00:11:30.314 --> 00:11:32.191
Whenever I hear it.
I think of you.

280
00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.360
Especially "A Little Help
from My Friends."

281
00:11:34.402 --> 00:11:35.820
I've lost about five pounds.

282
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:38.155
I'll fast for two weeks more
so we can go swimming.

283
00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:39.532
I smoked pot the other night.

284
00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:41.909
It's really something.
It's better than being drunk.

285
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.911
I might take it again.
but I don't know.

286
00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.955
We got some reviews
from the papers.

287
00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:47.331
I got some good ones.

288
00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.208
A few papers
said I was superb.

289
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.710
When I get back.
we'll have to go

290
00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:53.087
to Second City once
to see a show.

291
00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.755
I hear it's great.

292
00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:00.761
Directions on going out
on dates

293
00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:02.304
with anyone except John B:

294
00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:05.975
do not take bath and/or shower
three days prior to date.

295
00:12:06.016 --> 00:12:07.643
Do not use deodorant
before date.

296
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:10.271
Do not brush teeth
and/or use mouthwash.

297
00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:13.023
Wear mother's dress
which covers entire body.

298
00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:16.819
Tell date that you have mono.
cramps. and halitosis.

299
00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:20.573
If he tries to kiss you.
kill him.

300
00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:27.121
[Judy]  He had a real penchant
for getting his feelings out.

301
00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.789
My family was very Waspy

302
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:30.332
and emotions
weren't really discussed

303
00:12:30.374 --> 00:12:32.877
and he was very clear
about those things.

304
00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:38.758
[John]  A poem
by John Keats-Belushi.

305
00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:43.012
I wander through
the dark forest of my mind

306
00:12:43.053 --> 00:12:46.307
in search of something
that I must find.

307
00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:50.728
There is no purpose
to this little strife

308
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:55.024
to find the answer
of what should be life.

309
00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:58.486
The bountiful monotony
of this petty place

310
00:12:58.527 --> 00:13:01.864
is broken
by an understanding face.

311
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:06.410
For there the answer lies.

312
00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:09.246
the answer to my cries.

313
00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:11.248
I am forever yours

314
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.000
and yours alone.

315
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:14.293
John.

316
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.464
[Judy]  His experience
at summer stock

317
00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:21.592
was a really important
confidence builder.

318
00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:25.596
and it gave him a broader
outlook on the world

319
00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:29.350
and what was going on
and how he saw himself in it.

320
00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:32.102
But when we went
to Second City.

321
00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:35.648
that really cemented
his passion for acting.

322
00:13:35.689 --> 00:13:36.982
[actor]
Hi. Melvin. Sorry I'm late.

323
00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:38.359
I was working
down at the agency.

324
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.401
and I don't recognize you.

325
00:13:39.443 --> 00:13:40.444
You're new. aren't you?

326
00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:42.488
[Melvin]
Well. not terribly. I'm 30.

327
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.323
[laughter]

328
00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.909
soft dramatic music

329
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.246
[Judy]  The most memorable part
of the evening to me

330
00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:51.622
was that as we left.

331
00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.625
John stopped. turned around.
and said to me.

332
00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:57.253
"This is what I want to do...

333
00:13:57.294 --> 00:13:59.755
be an actor and create."

334
00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:04.051
And I'd have to be prepared
to support us

335
00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:07.179
because he was going to
probably never make any money.

336
00:14:07.221 --> 00:14:11.016
So I was prepared.

337
00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:13.978
But it was very much expected

338
00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:17.106
that he would go into business
with his father

339
00:14:17.147 --> 00:14:19.108
and take over the restaurant.

340
00:14:19.149 --> 00:14:21.819
That was his father's dream
for him.

341
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.655
But John knew it wasn't
what he wanted to do.

342
00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:28.200
and he knew it would be wrong
to try to do it

343
00:14:28.242 --> 00:14:30.911
because his heart
wasn't in it.

344
00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:33.163
And that was John Belushi 101.
you know?

345
00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:36.375
You don't do something
that you don't believe in.

346
00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:39.211
[John]
Dear Judy.

347
00:14:39.253 --> 00:14:42.464
I guess I'm going through what
they call an identity crisis.

348
00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:46.051
You know. "Who am I?
Who do I want to be?"

349
00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:49.388
Any way you look at it.
we're gonna suffer in life.

350
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.514
The only thing we can do

351
00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.058
is choose which way
we will suffer.

352
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.144
Sure.
I've got big plans for us.

353
00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:58.522
but what if I fall on my face
and we're miserable?

354
00:14:58.564 --> 00:15:00.524
Being a basically happy person

355
00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.943
prone to occasionally
melancholy despair.

356
00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:05.321
I'm not sure of anything
right now

357
00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:07.323
in this whole damn.
fucked up world.

358
00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:10.743
The only thing I am sure of
is that if it wasn't for you.

359
00:15:10.784 --> 00:15:12.661
I'd be a mental
and physical wreck.

360
00:15:12.703 --> 00:15:14.413
and you're
the most wonderful thing

361
00:15:14.455 --> 00:15:15.789
that's ever happened to me.

362
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:20.085
I think you're the one person
who really understands me.

363
00:15:20.127 --> 00:15:23.255
Love. John.

364
00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:26.425
The Stooges'
"Down on the Street"

365
00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:29.011
heavy rock music

366
00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:30.429
[Judy]
Within the following year.

367
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:33.015
he went to college and had
organized two friends of his.

368
00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:34.975
Tino Insana
and Steve Beshekas.

369
00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:38.896
into a group that they called
the West Compass Players.

370
00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.440
Just like he pulled a band
together earlier.

371
00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:44.234
it was.
"Let's make an improv group."

372
00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.696
[Tino]  John was
the most serious actor.

373
00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:48.906
even in those days.

374
00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:52.242
And he would continually
study improvising and comedy.

375
00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:54.411
and he read
three newspapers a day--

376
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:57.581
and a real political satirist.

377
00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:00.876
We would go to the coffeehouse
and hang out and rehearse.

378
00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:02.378
[John]
Okay. buster. on your feet!

379
00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:05.422
[Tino]  And those sketches were
about cops beating up hippies.

380
00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:08.300
Everything
was about hippies.

381
00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:09.551
[Tanner]
Were you with him

382
00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:11.637
when he went down to protest
at the convention?

383
00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:12.638
[Tino]  Oh. yes. I was there.

384
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.889
It was Judy and John and I.

385
00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:16.058
went down there.
and we were ten feet away

386
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.478
from the incident
that started the riot.

387
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.440
We were so much a part
of the counterculture.

388
00:16:23.482 --> 00:16:25.693
We were the '60s.

389
00:16:25.734 --> 00:16:27.444
[protesters clamoring]

390
00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:29.989
[Judy]  John was very much
opposed to the war.

391
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.740
He became quite radical.

392
00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:34.618
So there was a lot of politics
in his improv.

393
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.162
and he was having a lot
of fun.

394
00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:39.540
Of course. John still
had the Second City.

395
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:41.792
that hallowed institution
of comedy.

396
00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:44.169
as what he wanted to do.
and it turned out

397
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:46.338
that they had heard about
the West Compass Players.

398
00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.506
And they called and said.

399
00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:48.882
"Why don't you come in
and audition?"

400
00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:52.344
- [emcee] John Belushi!
- [laughter]

401
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.932
[Judy]  They invited him
to join the main stage cast.

402
00:16:56.974 --> 00:16:59.893
It's first time ever anybody
was put on the main stage

403
00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:02.771
who hadn't been
in the touring company.

404
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.523
[Fisher]
My biggest recollection

405
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:09.153
was his amazing magnetism
with the audience.

406
00:17:09.194 --> 00:17:10.779
[Jim Belushi]
He changed Second City.

407
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:13.073
'cause all they used to talk
about was philosophy

408
00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:14.867
and intellectual concepts.

409
00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:16.201
And John would come in there

410
00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:18.037
and play this hippie
off the street

411
00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:21.081
who's lost his memory
from smoking too much pot.

412
00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:23.876
and the audience
would go nuts.

413
00:17:23.917 --> 00:17:26.211
[Harold]
He became our strongman.

414
00:17:26.253 --> 00:17:28.380
And instead
of stealing every scene.

415
00:17:28.422 --> 00:17:30.090
he knew how to save any scene.

416
00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.926
Literally. he'd walk onstage.
and people would laugh.

417
00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:37.014
- [emcee] Mr. Truman Capote.
- [applause]

418
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:40.059
[laughter]

419
00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:46.315
[Fisher]  And his driving
ambition was the other one.

420
00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:48.776
He wanted to succeed.

421
00:17:48.817 --> 00:17:51.737
I remember him carrying his
reviews around in his pockets.

422
00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.907
We went to the local
TV station to do a show.

423
00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:56.533
and I remember seeing John...
[chuckles]

424
00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:59.620
"I'm John Belushi. and here's
what they say about me."

425
00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:03.457
I mean. geez.
who carries his reviews?

426
00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:06.293
[Harold]  Before John came.
I was the long-haired guy.

427
00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:09.630
I was the hippie. the freak.
the radical. whatever.

428
00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:12.382
but he was genuinely
all those things.

429
00:18:12.424 --> 00:18:14.134
And it's kind of like
what was happening

430
00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:15.928
with the whole generation.
you know?

431
00:18:15.969 --> 00:18:17.721
He kind of shattered
the limits

432
00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:21.016
and brought rock and roll
to the show.

433
00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:22.893
[Jim Belushi]
He said to me one time.

434
00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.813
"You got to go onstage
like a bull in a bullring.

435
00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:29.274
with that much energy
and that much physicality.

436
00:18:29.316 --> 00:18:32.069
Just jump out there
and do it."

437
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.737
[Harold]
We really felt that we were

438
00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.115
in the presence of genius.

439
00:18:36.156 --> 00:18:38.659
John would've done anything
for a laugh.

440
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.246
and. you know. that carried
over into everything else.

441
00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:45.749
I mean. he was heroic
in his consumption. you know?

442
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:48.293
And I both admired it
and feared it

443
00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:51.630
and realized that
it would take John really far.

444
00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:54.466
but there was something safer
and more comfortable

445
00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:55.717
about being me

446
00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:57.761
than there was
about being him.

447
00:18:57.803 --> 00:18:59.138
discordant violin notes

448
00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:01.473
[John]  You don't have
a cigarette on you. do you?

449
00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:04.768
- [interviewer]  Yeah.
- [John]  Ah. thanks.

450
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.854
Did you grow up
in Chicago?

451
00:19:06.895 --> 00:19:07.938
Yes.

452
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.482
- Are you Italian?
- No. I'm not.

453
00:19:10.524 --> 00:19:12.609
- What are you?
- I'm Albanian.

454
00:19:12.651 --> 00:19:13.777
Oh. really?

455
00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.654
Who was the little guy
in Abbott and Costello?

456
00:19:15.696 --> 00:19:17.739
Was that--
that was Costello.

457
00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:19.449
Do people ever compare you
to him?

458
00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:20.951
- [John] No.
- [man] No?

459
00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.328
- What's your opinion of him?
- I don't like him.

460
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.872
- You don't?
- No. I don't.

461
00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:25.664
No? Why?

462
00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.124
'Cause I don't think
he's funny.

463
00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:29.710
Huh.
How do you see yourself?

464
00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:34.423
I don't see myself
as any type at all.

465
00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:37.467
I see myself as a new type.
you know?

466
00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:39.219
I take each thing as it comes

467
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:42.639
to try and bring
whatever energy that I have.

468
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.726
which makes it different
than other performers.

469
00:19:45.767 --> 00:19:47.060
You know?

470
00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:49.521
I want to do things
that are new.

471
00:19:49.563 --> 00:19:52.649
upbeat rock music

472
00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:57.196
[car horns honking]

473
00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.157
[reporter]
National Lampoon

474
00:20:00.199 --> 00:20:01.742
has been called
a  MAD  magazine for grown-ups.

475
00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:05.162
Its hallmark is a kind
of anarchistic social satire.

476
00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:09.833
[Matty]  We were the humor
empire in the United States.

477
00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.461
And we were doing this play
called  Lemmings

478
00:20:12.502 --> 00:20:13.879
about a rock concert.

479
00:20:13.921 --> 00:20:17.966
I'd like to welcome you to
the Woodchuck Memorial Festival

480
00:20:18.008 --> 00:20:20.594
- of peace. love. and death.
- [laughter]

481
00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.804
[Judy] Lemmings
was a parody of Woodstock.

482
00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:24.723
It was the "woodchuck"
festival.

483
00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:25.974
Lemmings are little animals

484
00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:27.392
that. when
they get overpopulated.

485
00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:29.394
they just run
and jump over cliffs.

486
00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:31.146
and that was sort of the idea.

487
00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:32.689
One. two. two. one.

488
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:33.774
[Judy]  The target this time

489
00:20:33.815 --> 00:20:35.317
was the current
counterculture.

490
00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:37.569
which had its own gods
and divas

491
00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:39.571
who had not really
been made fun of.

492
00:20:39.613 --> 00:20:43.158
so taking shots. so to speak.
at people like Joe Cocker.

493
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.495
Crosby. Stills & Nash. Dylan.

494
00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:49.206
[Matty]  We already had
Chris Guest and Chevy Chase.

495
00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.999
and then the director came
to me and said.

496
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:53.335
"We heard that
there's this guy in Chicago

497
00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:56.505
with the Second City
who is absolutely fantastic."

498
00:20:56.546 --> 00:20:59.925
So I said. "Well.
get on a plane and grab him."

499
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:02.719
- Hey! How you been. man?
- Hey! Hey. hey. hey!

500
00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:03.804
[Ivan]
In a crowd

501
00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:05.222
of extraordinarily talented
people.

502
00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.975
he was the electrical force
that held it all together

503
00:21:08.016 --> 00:21:09.685
and gave the show its focus.

504
00:21:09.726 --> 00:21:12.813
National Lampoon's
"Lonely at the Bottom"

505
00:21:12.854 --> 00:21:16.024
band playing
jazzy show tune

506
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:21.113
Well. I'm standing here.
singing my song

507
00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:24.783
There ain't nothing to do.
and all my friends are gone

508
00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:28.245
I had sunshine
and a country home

509
00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:31.331
I've been on the cover
of  Rolling Stone

510
00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.709
- But it's lonely
- Yes. it's lonely

511
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.335
[Chevy]
He was clearly the star.

512
00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:39.172
He had a great command.
He had confidence.

513
00:21:39.214 --> 00:21:42.384
And. you know. we all
looked up to him that way.

514
00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:44.928
Yeah. now all my friends
are gone

515
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.513
Oh. yeah.
who will help my friends?

516
00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.140
Oh. yeah. who will
help my friends?

517
00:21:48.181 --> 00:21:50.100
Oh. yeah.
who will help my friends?

518
00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.144
[grunts unintelligibly]

519
00:21:54.187 --> 00:21:57.649
[cheers and applause]

520
00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:01.486
[laughter]

521
00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:04.823
- [John] Uh-oh.
- [laughter]

522
00:22:04.865 --> 00:22:05.949
[grunts]

523
00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.492
Hey!

524
00:22:07.534 --> 00:22:10.579
[laughter and applause]

525
00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:17.753
[spits]

526
00:22:17.794 --> 00:22:20.339
[laughter and applause]

527
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:21.840
What a day.

528
00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:25.927
[grunts]
I got to get up.

529
00:22:25.969 --> 00:22:29.222
[grunting]

530
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:36.229
Whoa.

531
00:22:38.148 --> 00:22:39.566
[grunts]

532
00:22:41.151 --> 00:22:43.403
What

533
00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:44.905
Would you do

534
00:22:44.946 --> 00:22:48.784
If I sang out of tune

535
00:22:48.825 --> 00:22:50.827
Would you stand up

536
00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:54.081
- And walk out--
- [man] One. two. three!

537
00:22:54.122 --> 00:22:55.957
[John vocalizing]

538
00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:58.001
[Judy]  Part of the appeal
for  Lemmings  was definitely

539
00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:00.670
the fact that the role was
to be a rock star.

540
00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:04.508
But that was also
when cocaine was introduced.

541
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:07.552
psychedelic rock music

542
00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:11.765
[Joe]  You can't talk about
John and not mention drugs

543
00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:14.476
because John did do a lot
of drugs.

544
00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:16.311
But it was part
of the culture.

545
00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:19.147
and everybody
was actively saying

546
00:23:19.189 --> 00:23:21.900
that drugs enhance
your artistic vision.

547
00:23:21.942 --> 00:23:25.320
And it was even encouraged
to a certain extent.

548
00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:27.781
But. I mean. it didn't affect
his performance

549
00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:28.949
or anything like that.

550
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.326
God. this is the biggest
quaalude I've ever seen.

551
00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:32.494
[splutters]

552
00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:35.455
[Sean]  Onstage.
he was dangerous.

553
00:23:35.497 --> 00:23:38.083
He gave the impression
that anything could happen.

554
00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:41.711
so you were engaged
by this raw id.

555
00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:45.132
And it was vulnerable.
the way an id is.

556
00:23:45.173 --> 00:23:47.384
There's nothing protecting it.

557
00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:49.761
It must've hurt a lot.

558
00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:52.431
[Eugenie]  In a way.
John was more fragile

559
00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:55.517
than those of us
who appeared more fragile.

560
00:23:55.559 --> 00:23:57.602
[reporter]  The biggest
White House scandal

561
00:23:57.644 --> 00:23:59.980
in a century
broke wide open today.

562
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:01.690
[Sean]  As the show
was running.

563
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:04.234
during the day
was the Watergate thing.

564
00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:07.529
What did the president know.
and when did he know it?

565
00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:09.406
All right. you.
Cool it.

566
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:10.657
[Sean]
So at night.

567
00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:13.493
we would do a version
of the Watergate hearings.

568
00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:14.536
[nerdy voice]
You know what?

569
00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:15.787
Please be quiet.
Please.

570
00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:17.956
[Sean]  It was called
"Mission: Impeachable."

571
00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:21.209
All right. I would like
to introduce at this time

572
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:24.171
President
Richard Milhous Nixon.

573
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.013
[laughter and applause]

574
00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:38.727
[John]  This
is another exciting chapter

575
00:24:38.768 --> 00:24:42.689
in the true-life drama
of John the Judy-lover.

576
00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:46.443
I got my woman.
and that's all I need.

577
00:24:46.485 --> 00:24:48.653
[Judy]  When I started working
at the  Lampoon

578
00:24:48.695 --> 00:24:50.030
in the art department.

579
00:24:50.071 --> 00:24:51.740
Michael O'Donoghue
was doing a book

580
00:24:51.781 --> 00:24:53.783
called the
Encyclopedia of Humor.

581
00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:56.077
So we became friendly.

582
00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:59.873
And then Michael started
National Lampoon Radio Hour.

583
00:24:59.915 --> 00:25:01.917
I had suggested John
for the show.

584
00:25:01.958 --> 00:25:05.170
and. slowly.
because he came to trust me.

585
00:25:05.212 --> 00:25:07.047
he said.
"Okay. let's bring him in."

586
00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:08.882
[John]  Good evening.
This is John Belushi.

587
00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:11.218
And this is the
National Lampoon Radio Hour.

588
00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:13.428
[actor as Nixon]
You idiot! Now move!

589
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.430
- [grunts]
- [thump]

590
00:25:15.472 --> 00:25:16.681
[John]
He's dead.

591
00:25:16.723 --> 00:25:18.975
You killed Ziegler when
you pushed him. Mr. President.

592
00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:20.393
[actor as Nixon]
I didn't push him.

593
00:25:20.435 --> 00:25:21.686
Mitchell pushed him.

594
00:25:21.728 --> 00:25:23.772
Don't blame me for everything
that goes on around here.

595
00:25:23.813 --> 00:25:25.398
[John as Brando]  I could've
been an anal retentive instead

596
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.359
of a thumb-sucker.
which is what I am.

597
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.610
Let's face it. Charley.

598
00:25:28.652 --> 00:25:29.986
[Belzer as Steiger]  Here. kid.
you better take this.

599
00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:31.112
You're going to need it;
I don't have time

600
00:25:31.154 --> 00:25:32.239
to fool around with you.

601
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.574
I just dropped a big load
in my pants!

602
00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:37.202
[Bob]  Anybody who he thought
was talented

603
00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:39.538
he would basically want
to have work with him.

604
00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:42.123
And John was responsible
for bringing everybody

605
00:25:42.165 --> 00:25:45.085
that he knew from Second City
into the  Radio Hour.

606
00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:47.295
He brought Gilda down.

607
00:25:47.337 --> 00:25:49.839
Bill Murray. Harold Ramis.

608
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:53.927
And then Michael O'Donoghue
ended up splitting

609
00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:55.929
from the  National Lampoon.

610
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:58.723
So we needed another director.

611
00:25:58.765 --> 00:26:00.892
and the obvious choice
was John.

612
00:26:00.934 --> 00:26:04.854
You are listening to the
National Lampoon Radio Hour.

613
00:26:04.896 --> 00:26:06.106
[overlapping chatter]

614
00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:08.316
[Harold] Hey. you guys!
Come in for a second!

615
00:26:08.358 --> 00:26:11.570
Get out of that shower and stop
horsing around over there!

616
00:26:11.611 --> 00:26:15.198
Stop snapping those towels.
I got something to say.

617
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.826
John always was
the anchor for everything.

618
00:26:17.867 --> 00:26:19.035
even socially.

619
00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:20.662
He and Judy would have
the Thanksgiving dinners.

620
00:26:20.704 --> 00:26:23.331
and it was his house
that you'd go to to hang out.

621
00:26:23.373 --> 00:26:25.292
They were already
like a married couple

622
00:26:25.333 --> 00:26:26.751
when they were so young.

623
00:26:26.793 --> 00:26:28.962
And she was always by his side

624
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:33.258
and just as funny and dark
and crazy as everyone else.

625
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.509
[Paul]
I'll tell you.

626
00:26:34.551 --> 00:26:37.095
Judy was a great
steadying influence on John.

627
00:26:37.137 --> 00:26:39.931
People knew that
he was gonna become a star.

628
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:41.016
And he knew it.

629
00:26:41.057 --> 00:26:42.601
But Judy. she always kind of

630
00:26:42.642 --> 00:26:44.227
brought him back down
to Earth.

631
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:47.063
'cause as talented and wild
and impulsive as he was.

632
00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:50.275
whenever some sort of order
was imposed on him.

633
00:26:50.317 --> 00:26:52.944
either self-imposed
or otherwise.

634
00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:55.655
it had a good effect on him.

635
00:26:55.697 --> 00:26:58.617
Don't want to discuss it

636
00:26:58.658 --> 00:27:01.870
Think it's time
for a change

637
00:27:01.911 --> 00:27:04.831
You may get disgusted

638
00:27:04.873 --> 00:27:08.001
Start thinking
that I'm strange

639
00:27:08.043 --> 00:27:11.296
That case
I'll go underground

640
00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:14.758
Get some solid rest

641
00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.551
Never have to worry

642
00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:20.013
About who's got what
and what is best

643
00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:24.184
I said oh. oh. Domino

644
00:27:24.225 --> 00:27:25.977
Roll me over. Romeo

645
00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:28.229
Time for a change

646
00:27:28.271 --> 00:27:29.439
All right

647
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:30.940
[Aykroyd]
I met him in Toronto.

648
00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:34.402
He came up to grab people
for his radio endeavors.

649
00:27:34.444 --> 00:27:37.864
but I couldn't do it 'cause
I had a TV show in Canada.

650
00:27:37.906 --> 00:27:39.949
[Bob]  One of
the greatest things John found

651
00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:41.743
was a friendship in Danny.

652
00:27:41.785 --> 00:27:42.911
[Tanner]
Mm-hmm.

653
00:27:42.952 --> 00:27:45.288
[Bob]  You know.
Danny and John were really.

654
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:46.706
I mean. amazingly tight.

655
00:27:46.748 --> 00:27:49.084
[Aykroyd]  We fell in love
the moment we met

656
00:27:49.125 --> 00:27:50.669
'cause he was just one
of those characters

657
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.213
that walked into a room
and high wattage from day one.

658
00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:56.341
And. you know. we saw the
worth in each other right away

659
00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:58.426
for a really
enduring friendship.

660
00:27:58.468 --> 00:27:59.928
[Harold]
You know. the great thing was

661
00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:01.888
everyone liked everyone else.

662
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.972
I mean.
no one was getting rich.

663
00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:04.808
but we did not have
to hustle.

664
00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:06.768
No one had
to take second jobs.

665
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.228
And I think
we all started feeling.

666
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:11.398
"Hey. maybe we are as good
as we hope we are."

667
00:28:12.982 --> 00:28:16.027
[Gilda]  Hi. I'm your
host-person. Gilda Radner.

668
00:28:16.069 --> 00:28:17.654
and tonight I'm gonna read you

669
00:28:17.696 --> 00:28:20.532
the people who contributed
to this week's show.

670
00:28:20.573 --> 00:28:21.616
John Belushi.

671
00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:24.285
Chevy Chase.
Brian Doyle-Murray.

672
00:28:24.327 --> 00:28:26.496
Chris Guest.
Doug Kenney.

673
00:28:26.538 --> 00:28:28.248
Bill Murray.
Joe Flaherty.

674
00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:29.374
Harold Ramis. Ed--

675
00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:31.126
- [John]  It's Ray-mis.
- [Gilda]  What?

676
00:28:31.167 --> 00:28:32.252
[John]
Ray-mis. not Rah-mus.

677
00:28:32.293 --> 00:28:33.461
[Gilda]
You want to spell it?

678
00:28:33.503 --> 00:28:34.587
[John]
R-A-M-I-S. Ramis.

679
00:28:34.629 --> 00:28:35.797
[Gilda]
And how do you pronounce that?

680
00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.048
[John]
Pronounce it Ray-mus.

681
00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.675
[Gilda]  Do you say.
"Will you slum the door?"

682
00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:40.969
[John]  Will you just read
the credits right. Gilda?

683
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.471
[Aykroyd]  And there you have
the essential struts. pillars.

684
00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:46.141
and crutches of
the American comedy industry

685
00:28:46.182 --> 00:28:47.434
as we have it today.

686
00:28:47.475 --> 00:28:49.352
and John was. like.
one of these cohesive forces

687
00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:51.396
bringing it all together.
you know?

688
00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:53.857
low. ambient ringing

689
00:28:53.898 --> 00:28:56.985
[Lorne]  I'd seen John
in his show with Gilda

690
00:28:57.026 --> 00:28:59.904
and Billy Murray
and Harold Ramis.

691
00:28:59.946 --> 00:29:02.031
You know.
I thought he was interesting.

692
00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:04.284
but I wasn't knocked out.

693
00:29:04.325 --> 00:29:06.035
[car horns blaring]

694
00:29:06.077 --> 00:29:07.787
dramatic music

695
00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:10.206
There was a young
executive named Dick Ebersol

696
00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:13.585
who came over to NBC to be the
new director of  Late Night.

697
00:29:13.626 --> 00:29:16.171
He and I had a bunch
of meetings.

698
00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:17.672
I just sort of added up

699
00:29:17.714 --> 00:29:19.174
everything
I was interested in.

700
00:29:19.215 --> 00:29:22.218
which was comedy and music
and politics and films.

701
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.845
and threw it all together.

702
00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:26.890
and I sort of at the beginning
had the ingredients.

703
00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:29.142
I didn't quite have
the recipe.

704
00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:30.435
[crew member] Okay. rework.

705
00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:31.811
[Matty]  I mean.
Saturday Night Live

706
00:29:31.853 --> 00:29:35.315
was the same format as the
National Lampoon Radio Show.

707
00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:36.608
And most of the actors came

708
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:37.942
from one
of the  Lampoon  shows

709
00:29:37.984 --> 00:29:40.987
and a number of the writers
and what have you.

710
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:43.823
Lorne. of course. denies it.

711
00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:47.076
[Lorne]  Both Michael O'Donoghue
and Chevy

712
00:29:47.118 --> 00:29:51.706
wanted me to meet with John.
and they were big fans.

713
00:29:51.748 --> 00:29:53.291
But at our first meeting.

714
00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:55.627
he said that
he didn't do television.

715
00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:59.130
You know. like I'm supposed
to convince him to do it.

716
00:29:59.172 --> 00:30:02.217
And I thought.
"Oh. it's trouble.

717
00:30:02.258 --> 00:30:03.760
He's trouble."

718
00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:06.012
Because I was looking for.
you know.

719
00:30:06.054 --> 00:30:07.847
a group of people who saw this

720
00:30:07.889 --> 00:30:10.141
as the opportunity
that I saw it as.

721
00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:13.102
which was a sort
of cultural upheaval.

722
00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:17.816
and the enemy. to me.
was ambivalence.

723
00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:20.193
[Judy]  He went in
with his attitude

724
00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:22.946
and told him immediately
that he hated television

725
00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:25.281
and his television
had spit all over it.

726
00:30:25.323 --> 00:30:28.827
He pretty much turned
Lorne's conviction true.

727
00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:32.080
that he thought John would be
not the right mix.

728
00:30:32.121 --> 00:30:33.498
[chuckles]

729
00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:38.002
[Rosie]  Lorne didn't like to
have his authority challenged.

730
00:30:38.044 --> 00:30:40.255
and Belushi's macho flexing

731
00:30:40.296 --> 00:30:43.716
was not something that Lorne
was gonna warm to. you know?

732
00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:44.759
[Tanner]
Right.

733
00:30:44.801 --> 00:30:46.344
[Rosie]
He didn't like power plays.

734
00:30:46.386 --> 00:30:48.054
We were the last two
to get hired for that show...

735
00:30:48.096 --> 00:30:49.639
- [unintelligible]
- Because they weren't sure--

736
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.683
- We were too much.
- We had reputations of--

737
00:30:51.724 --> 00:30:54.519
I had what you call
a bad attitude. you know?

738
00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:56.980
"How about TV?"
I was kind of a punk.

739
00:30:57.021 --> 00:31:00.483
You know. I said. "I'll let you
have me on your show."

740
00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:03.570
I was real--the worst way
to try and get a job.

741
00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:05.405
Lorne Michaels
was not nuts about me.

742
00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:08.449
So when I went in to audition
for  Saturday Night.

743
00:31:08.491 --> 00:31:10.368
he said.
"What are you gonna do?"

744
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.245
Turned around and went...
[shouting]

745
00:31:12.287 --> 00:31:15.248
dramatic music

746
00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:18.501
Just before I was
on the  Saturday Night  show.

747
00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:20.378
there was a station
in New York

748
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.672
showing a samurai movie.

749
00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:24.924
It was Toshirô Mifune.

750
00:31:24.966 --> 00:31:27.886
- [samurai speaking Japanese]
- Oh. my God.

751
00:31:27.927 --> 00:31:29.262
Couldn't believe it.

752
00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:31.180
The sword fighting was
fabulous.

753
00:31:31.222 --> 00:31:32.515
and I was fascinated.

754
00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.726
So I just got doing it
around the house.

755
00:31:34.767 --> 00:31:35.768
[shouting in Japanese]

756
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:37.228
Like. I would take
this broomstick

757
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.480
that we had in the house
and I'd stick it in my belt.

758
00:31:39.522 --> 00:31:41.733
and I'd...
[imitating Japanese]

759
00:31:41.774 --> 00:31:42.734
[battle cry]

760
00:31:42.775 --> 00:31:43.985
I'd go up to my cats.
you know.

761
00:31:44.027 --> 00:31:45.361
with a sword and go...
[imitates Japanese]

762
00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:46.696
[bellows]

763
00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:48.156
- [glass shatters]
- [cat screeches]

764
00:31:48.197 --> 00:31:49.866
[Aykroyd]
They loved it. they loved it.

765
00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:52.911
dramatic music

766
00:31:55.663 --> 00:31:58.750
[crew member]
Can you hear me up there?

767
00:31:58.791 --> 00:32:00.668
[Anne]
Pick an adjective.

768
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.754
It was great;
it was horrible;

769
00:32:02.795 --> 00:32:05.506
it was fascinating;
it was exhausting;

770
00:32:05.548 --> 00:32:06.841
it was exhilarating;

771
00:32:06.883 --> 00:32:09.510
and that was before
the show had launched.

772
00:32:09.552 --> 00:32:10.595
[Aykroyd]
Well. it was like

773
00:32:10.637 --> 00:32:12.597
being in a college dorm.
you know?

774
00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:15.099
We had beers
and smoked the herb.

775
00:32:15.141 --> 00:32:18.645
[Rosie]  Well. you just smelled
it in the air. and you knew.

776
00:32:18.686 --> 00:32:21.940
And there was definitely
cocaine around.

777
00:32:21.981 --> 00:32:24.609
[Tom]  Walked past Lorne's
office late one night.

778
00:32:24.651 --> 00:32:25.777
and there's Belushi.

779
00:32:25.818 --> 00:32:27.779
was snorting coke off
of Lorne's desk.

780
00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.406
You know. Lorne was long gone
by that time.

781
00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:31.991
[Anne]
I remember John and Lorne

782
00:32:32.033 --> 00:32:35.161
getting into some kind
of fight and Lorne firing him.

783
00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:37.246
[Tanner]  Anne Beatts said
that you fired John

784
00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:39.457
just before the start
of the show; is that--

785
00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:42.293
[Lorne]  God. it makes perfect
sense that I would have.

786
00:32:42.335 --> 00:32:43.628
[Anne]
I was like. "No. no. no.

787
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.213
we have to put this
back together."

788
00:32:45.254 --> 00:32:48.967
And I went and found him in
some divey bar on 48th Street.

789
00:32:49.008 --> 00:32:50.969
Said. "Go back and apologize."

790
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:53.763
And Lorne. of course.
you know. did take him back.

791
00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:55.390
[Snyder]
Beginning on October the 11th.

792
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:58.226
Saturday Night  premieres
a whole new live venture.

793
00:32:58.267 --> 00:33:00.061
What should we look for
on your program?

794
00:33:00.103 --> 00:33:02.355
- Anxiety.
- [Snyder] Fear?

795
00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:04.732
Yeah.
It's--

796
00:33:04.774 --> 00:33:07.360
[Snyder] Will all of you
be seen every week?

797
00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:08.528
Well. we've got eight.

798
00:33:08.569 --> 00:33:11.572
and we're hoping
for two to really work.

799
00:33:11.614 --> 00:33:15.034
I mean. so not all of these
people will become stars.

800
00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:17.120
[chuckling]

801
00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:19.455
[crew member]
Quiet. please.

802
00:33:19.497 --> 00:33:21.874
[Anne]  And then.
despite Lorne's misgivings.

803
00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:23.668
John was in the opening

804
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.462
of the first
Saturday Night Live  ever.

805
00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:28.548
Let's begin.

806
00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:31.759
Repeat after me.

807
00:33:31.801 --> 00:33:34.303
- I would like...
- [John] I would like...

808
00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:35.763
[Michael]
To feed your fingertips...

809
00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:36.931
To feed your fingertips...

810
00:33:36.973 --> 00:33:40.727
- [Michael] To the wolverines.
- To the wolverines.

811
00:33:40.768 --> 00:33:44.313
- Next. I am afraid...
- I am afraid...

812
00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:45.773
- [Michael] We are out...
- We are out...

813
00:33:45.815 --> 00:33:47.316
- [Michael] Of badgers.
- Of badgers.

814
00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:49.485
- [Michael] Would you accept...
- Would you accept...

815
00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:51.404
- [Michael] A wolverine...
- A wolverine...

816
00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:54.657
- [Michael] In its place?
- In its place?

817
00:33:54.699 --> 00:33:59.370
- Next: "Hey." Ned exclaimed.
- "Hey." Ned exclaimed.

818
00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:01.247
- [Michael] "Let's boil"...
- "Let's boil"...

819
00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:05.334
- [Michael] "The wolverine."
- "The wolverine."

820
00:34:05.376 --> 00:34:06.377
Next...

821
00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:08.421
[gasps]

822
00:34:13.092 --> 00:34:14.594
[gasps]

823
00:34:14.635 --> 00:34:17.930
[laughter and applause]

824
00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:22.602
[inaudible speech]

825
00:34:22.643 --> 00:34:26.522
Live from New York.
it's  Saturday Night!

826
00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:29.609
[Anne]  I mean. it wasn't.
like. an instant megahit.

827
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.528
but it did build to that
relatively quickly.

828
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.823
They became a new group
of cultural icons.

829
00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:38.242
The editorial was about Jewry.
not jewelry.

830
00:34:38.284 --> 00:34:41.245
Ooh. well.
that's very important.

831
00:34:41.287 --> 00:34:42.371
Yes.

832
00:34:42.413 --> 00:34:44.332
- Never mind.
- [laughter]

833
00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:46.167
[Bernie]
It was very. very popular

834
00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:47.710
because of its attitude.

835
00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:52.090
Honey. did you send
for interior demolitionists?

836
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:54.550
[Bernie]  It was expressing
the rebellion

837
00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:57.970
that the ordinary person
was feeling.

838
00:34:58.012 --> 00:34:59.806
[Rosie]
We were children of the '60s.

839
00:34:59.847 --> 00:35:02.558
We'd come out of free love
and sex. drugs. rock and roll.

840
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.977
but also out of civil rights
and feminism.

841
00:35:05.019 --> 00:35:08.940
and there was nothing on the
airwaves that fed back to us

842
00:35:08.981 --> 00:35:10.358
the culture we were living.

843
00:35:10.399 --> 00:35:14.112
It's just a word association.
Colored?

844
00:35:14.153 --> 00:35:16.614
- Redneck.
- [laughter]

845
00:35:16.656 --> 00:35:19.325
- Burrhead.
- Cracker!

846
00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:21.244
[laughter]

847
00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:22.829
New Shimmer is a floor wax.

848
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.331
No. New Shimmer
is a dessert topping.

849
00:35:25.373 --> 00:35:28.751
- It's a floor wax.
- It's a dessert topping.

850
00:35:28.793 --> 00:35:30.795
It's a floor wax.
I'm telling you.

851
00:35:30.837 --> 00:35:32.588
It's a dessert topping.
you cow!

852
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:35.133
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.
Calm down. you two.

853
00:35:35.174 --> 00:35:39.178
New Shimmer's a floor wax
and a dessert topping.

854
00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.305
- Mr. Bee?
- Yes?

855
00:35:41.347 --> 00:35:43.933
Congratulations.
it's a worker.

856
00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.143
It's a worker?

857
00:35:45.184 --> 00:35:47.603
[Judy]  In the very first days
of  Saturday Night.

858
00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:49.689
all John did was be a bee.

859
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:52.108
which he didn't like doing.

860
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:54.360
There were roles
he thought he could do better

861
00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:55.820
that someone else would get.

862
00:35:55.862 --> 00:35:57.530
He didn't think he had a voice
to express that

863
00:35:57.572 --> 00:36:00.867
or be taken seriously
'cause Lorne made the choices.

864
00:36:00.908 --> 00:36:04.078
Do you think we like this?

865
00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.789
- No.
- [laughter]

866
00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:08.749
But we don't have any choice.

867
00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:10.376
[Judy]
We'd walk down the street.

868
00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:11.752
and someone
would hang out their car

869
00:36:11.794 --> 00:36:13.671
and point at John and go.
"Hey. Mr. Bee!"

870
00:36:13.713 --> 00:36:15.256
It was not what he had dreamed

871
00:36:15.298 --> 00:36:17.800
his life in television
would be.

872
00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:18.801
Meanwhile...

873
00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:19.886
[announcer]
And now

874
00:36:19.927 --> 00:36:22.471
Weekend Update
with Chevy Chase.

875
00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:24.932
I love it when you make noise.

876
00:36:24.974 --> 00:36:26.392
[laughter]

877
00:36:26.434 --> 00:36:29.478
Remember when--
I got to go. hon.

878
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.521
Good evening.

879
00:36:30.563 --> 00:36:32.356
I'm Chevy Chase.
and you're not.

880
00:36:32.398 --> 00:36:33.816
[laughter]

881
00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:36.777
[Judy]  Chevy had his "I'm
Chevy Chase. and you're not."

882
00:36:36.819 --> 00:36:39.238
so he was getting
pretty famous.

883
00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.532
Don't move.
There's a bee on your hand.

884
00:36:41.574 --> 00:36:44.911
[Candice]  From the first show
to the one I did.

885
00:36:44.952 --> 00:36:46.204
which was the fourth show.

886
00:36:46.245 --> 00:36:48.122
"I'm Chevy Chase.
and you're not"

887
00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:50.958
became part
of the pop culture.

888
00:36:56.339 --> 00:37:00.426
Live from New York.
it's  Saturday Night!

889
00:37:00.468 --> 00:37:02.220
[Judy]  It was the
Chevy Chase show.

890
00:37:02.261 --> 00:37:05.890
Chevy. Chevy.
I love when you fall down

891
00:37:05.932 --> 00:37:08.809
It's  Saturday Night
on my TV

892
00:37:08.851 --> 00:37:13.814
Oh. but Chevy. every time
you take that fall

893
00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:16.859
I wish
that you were falling

894
00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:19.612
Falling for me

895
00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:20.905
Good evening.

896
00:37:20.947 --> 00:37:23.115
I'm God. and here's the news.

897
00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:24.492
[applause]

898
00:37:24.533 --> 00:37:27.286
[Judy]  When Chevy. you know.
did take off very quickly

899
00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:29.705
and John didn't.
that was confusing to John

900
00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:30.998
and did cause some problems.

901
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.875
- You comfortable?
- Oh. yeah.

902
00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:36.420
- Okay. good.
- [laughter]

903
00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:39.173
[Penny]  Oh. he'd go
on his tirades and sulk.

904
00:37:39.215 --> 00:37:40.341
There was a lot of.

905
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:42.385
"How come Chevy's
in more stuff than I am?"

906
00:37:42.426 --> 00:37:43.594
That was after. at night.

907
00:37:43.636 --> 00:37:45.554
You know.
he'd come over to your hotel

908
00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:48.891
and then start moping and ask
if he wasn't "in" enough.

909
00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:51.102
[chuckles]
And that he was talented.

910
00:37:51.143 --> 00:37:53.104
or wasn't he talented
or what is it?

911
00:37:53.145 --> 00:37:55.648
"You are talented.
just not. you know.

912
00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.900
doing what Chevy's doing
at the moment."

913
00:37:57.942 --> 00:37:59.110
"Why not?"

914
00:37:59.151 --> 00:38:01.654
[Chevy]  He did not
throw himself into the group.

915
00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:04.907
He didn't come into the office
a lot and discuss sketches.

916
00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:07.618
I spent most of my time
in the office with Lorne.

917
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.161
[Lorne]  All the way up
from Second City

918
00:38:09.203 --> 00:38:11.622
to  National Lampoon.  John had
always been the ringleader.

919
00:38:11.664 --> 00:38:12.665
[Tanner]
Yeah.

920
00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:14.417
[Lorne]
He had been the top banana.

921
00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:17.670
and now it was all about Chevy
all the time.

922
00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:20.381
and that was driving
John crazy.

923
00:38:20.423 --> 00:38:23.676
Then with the samurai
on Richard Pryor's show.

924
00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:25.594
that was sort of
the breakthrough.

925
00:38:25.636 --> 00:38:27.138
[John shouts]

926
00:38:27.179 --> 00:38:28.973
[Lorne]  John already had
the character.

927
00:38:29.015 --> 00:38:30.725
and that came about because

928
00:38:30.766 --> 00:38:33.102
Richard did not want
to come to the offices

929
00:38:33.144 --> 00:38:36.230
so I had John head over
to his hotel room

930
00:38:36.272 --> 00:38:38.607
and work with him there.
and Richard was like.

931
00:38:38.649 --> 00:38:40.568
"I got to do that.
I can do that with him."

932
00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:43.738
- [imitating Japanese]
- [imitating Japanese]

933
00:38:43.779 --> 00:38:47.825
[laughter and applause]

934
00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:51.329
- [imitating Japanese]
- [imitating Japanese]

935
00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:58.252
Fellas. which one of you is
gonna carry my bags upstairs?

936
00:38:58.294 --> 00:39:01.714
- [both shouting]
- [laughter and applause]

937
00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:06.385
[both growling]

938
00:39:06.427 --> 00:39:08.304
[both shout]

939
00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:09.764
[laughter]

940
00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:11.098
[Mitch]
Everybody. you know.

941
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.641
New York Magazine  and
Rolling Stone  and everybody

942
00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:15.603
was focusing on Chevy.
but John. I don't know.

943
00:39:15.644 --> 00:39:17.730
his energy
and the danger of him.

944
00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:20.524
the kind of excitement
whenever he came on screen

945
00:39:20.566 --> 00:39:22.360
was jarring...

946
00:39:22.401 --> 00:39:24.653
and a comedy
I hadn't seen before.

947
00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:27.990
- Ah-choo.
- [laughter]

948
00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:31.285
[Judy]  It was
a very mixed year for John.

949
00:39:31.327 --> 00:39:33.287
It was a disappointment
on a level

950
00:39:33.329 --> 00:39:36.707
that he wasn't able
to have the voice he wanted.

951
00:39:36.749 --> 00:39:39.960
but there was a certain family
sensibility for John.

952
00:39:40.002 --> 00:39:42.505
in that Danny was there.

953
00:39:42.546 --> 00:39:45.257
and it was a very strong...

954
00:39:45.299 --> 00:39:46.967
very strong friendship.

955
00:39:47.009 --> 00:39:48.344
[interviewer]
I get the feeling that out of

956
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.471
all the "not ready
for primetime" players.

957
00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:52.139
you two are really
close friends.

958
00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:54.517
[Aykroyd]  Well. actually for
the first year of the show.

959
00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:56.435
none of sure it was gonna
go past seven shows.

960
00:39:56.477 --> 00:39:58.479
so I crashed at his house.
you know?

961
00:39:58.521 --> 00:39:59.855
So we'd take trips.

962
00:39:59.897 --> 00:40:02.358
[John]  Like. you know. Dan and
I would get sick of the show.

963
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.734
and we'd get a driveaway car

964
00:40:03.776 --> 00:40:06.112
and just burn across
the country in three days

965
00:40:06.153 --> 00:40:08.697
- with the CB radio.
- [indistinct chatter]

966
00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:11.492
He'd drive like a madman
and we'd talk about something.

967
00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:12.827
We'd play music. you know?

968
00:40:12.868 --> 00:40:14.412
[Aykroyd]  He turned me on
to the Allman Brothers

969
00:40:14.453 --> 00:40:16.705
and I turned him on
to "Ride of the Valkyries."

970
00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.624
Wagner. you know.
which he'd never heard.

971
00:40:18.666 --> 00:40:23.421
As we were sailing across the
Nevada mountains. you know?

972
00:40:23.462 --> 00:40:26.257
Wagner's
"Flight of the Valkyries"

973
00:40:26.298 --> 00:40:28.551
[overlapping chatter]

974
00:40:30.636 --> 00:40:32.930
[truck horn blasts]

975
00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:36.600
[Lorne]  And then at the end
of the first year.

976
00:40:36.642 --> 00:40:39.895
Chevy announced
that he was leaving the show.

977
00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:43.107
[John]
Hey. Mr. Chase.

978
00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:46.360
[both chuckling]

979
00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:51.449
[Lorne]
And with Chevy gone.

980
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:53.826
the thing John most hoped for.

981
00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:56.829
which was that he would be
the alpha male.

982
00:40:56.871 --> 00:40:59.290
now had happened.

983
00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:02.126
Now he had
what he said he wanted.

984
00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:05.296
Right now. NBC.

985
00:41:05.337 --> 00:41:07.798
one of the country's
largest corporations.

986
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.968
- with billions in assets...
- [laughter]

987
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.970
Is waiting for me.

988
00:41:13.012 --> 00:41:15.473
a stupid. troublemaking
punk actor

989
00:41:15.514 --> 00:41:18.309
from Wheaton. Illinois.
to open the show.

990
00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:19.852
[Tanner]
And everybody says. you know.

991
00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:21.187
John was. you know.
the everyman.

992
00:41:21.228 --> 00:41:22.813
and that's why
he connected with people.

993
00:41:22.855 --> 00:41:25.232
[Lorne]  Well. John had that
connection with the audience

994
00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:27.276
where they can see
right into his heart.

995
00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:29.111
You know.
when I think of Ireland.

996
00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:31.655
I think a lot
of colorful Irish expressions.

997
00:41:31.697 --> 00:41:33.657
like "top of the morning
to ya."

998
00:41:33.699 --> 00:41:35.618
"kiss the Blarney Stone"...

999
00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.870
[Lorne]  There was
so much vulnerability

1000
00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:40.331
that you thought
you knew who he was.

1001
00:41:40.372 --> 00:41:43.751
"I'd like to smash you in
the face with my shillelagh."

1002
00:41:43.792 --> 00:41:47.087
Ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Joe Cocker!

1003
00:41:47.129 --> 00:41:49.715
Seems I've got to have...

1004
00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:52.176
[Alan]  I remember standing
on the floor once.

1005
00:41:52.218 --> 00:41:53.928
Lorne saying. "It's Gleason."

1006
00:41:53.969 --> 00:41:56.847
And you think about it.
it was Ralph Kramden there.

1007
00:41:56.889 --> 00:42:00.726
There was something so
blue-collar-ish about him.

1008
00:42:00.768 --> 00:42:02.019
Ahh.

1009
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:03.521
[Alan]   It was almost like
he didn't have

1010
00:42:03.562 --> 00:42:05.147
a command of the language.

1011
00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.857
[all scatting]

1012
00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:08.817
[Alan]
Where he made you laugh

1013
00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:11.111
was when
he was breaking things.

1014
00:42:11.153 --> 00:42:13.322
[shouting]

1015
00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:16.158
Joe Cocker's
"Feelin' Alright"

1016
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.077
[Alan]
Conveyance of conspiracy

1017
00:42:18.118 --> 00:42:20.287
with the raise of an eyebrow.

1018
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:23.541
And you hooked into the ride
that he was going on.

1019
00:42:23.582 --> 00:42:26.043
At least when George C. Scott
won the Oscar.

1020
00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:27.503
he didn't accept it.

1021
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:30.297
You know. Marlon Brando
sent up an Indian.

1022
00:42:30.339 --> 00:42:32.258
Now. you could've sent up
an Indian.

1023
00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:35.302
- But. no. no. no!
- [laughter and applause]

1024
00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:37.805
[Alan]  People reacted to John
and loved John

1025
00:42:37.846 --> 00:42:40.849
in the same way
that they love gangsters.

1026
00:42:40.891 --> 00:42:43.477
I'm not feeling
that good myself. oh

1027
00:42:43.519 --> 00:42:44.603
Oh. no

1028
00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:47.523
Of course. I'm talking
about Elizabeth Taylor.

1029
00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:51.026
Liz. welcome
to  Celebrity Corner.

1030
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:53.737
[Alan]  Gangsters
are blue-collar immigrants

1031
00:42:53.779 --> 00:42:55.155
who live the American dream

1032
00:42:55.197 --> 00:42:57.366
by basically going outside
the system

1033
00:42:57.408 --> 00:42:58.909
and breaking all the rules.

1034
00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:01.245
[grunting and gagging]

1035
00:43:01.287 --> 00:43:04.415
[coughing]

1036
00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:06.959
Well. thank you so much. Liz.

1037
00:43:07.001 --> 00:43:08.252
It's been a real treat

1038
00:43:08.294 --> 00:43:11.630
for me to have you
on  Celebrity Corner.

1039
00:43:11.672 --> 00:43:15.509
And I think all your fans
in the whole world

1040
00:43:15.551 --> 00:43:17.219
are joining me when I say.

1041
00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.596
"Good luck with that diet."

1042
00:43:18.637 --> 00:43:20.389
[cheers and applause]

1043
00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:22.725
[Lorne]  John was the leader.
after Chevy.

1044
00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:25.352
of "all for one. one for all."

1045
00:43:25.394 --> 00:43:27.187
You know. he loved the show.

1046
00:43:27.229 --> 00:43:29.273
[host]  Would you consider
yourself an anarchist?

1047
00:43:29.315 --> 00:43:30.733
[John]  A disciplined
anarchist. yeah.

1048
00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:32.568
Yeah. sure.
I'm an anarchist.

1049
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:34.695
One thing I think I'm not
is a professional.

1050
00:43:34.737 --> 00:43:37.239
I mean. I'd rather be an
anarchist than a professional.

1051
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:38.699
Because I think there are
too many people

1052
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:40.868
just kind of sitting down
and letting things happen.

1053
00:43:40.909 --> 00:43:43.329
I like to shake things up
a little bit.

1054
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.580
[chain saw revs]

1055
00:43:44.622 --> 00:43:46.874
Today with the success
of  Saturday Night.

1056
00:43:46.915 --> 00:43:49.627
TV comedy
is changing TV. right?

1057
00:43:49.668 --> 00:43:51.295
Wrong.
Dead wrong.

1058
00:43:51.337 --> 00:43:52.755
You see. we're an exception.

1059
00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:55.883
a tropical island
in a sea of video sludge.

1060
00:43:55.924 --> 00:43:59.386
[Lorne]  But that first
intoxicating period of success

1061
00:43:59.428 --> 00:44:01.305
is incredibly confusing.

1062
00:44:01.347 --> 00:44:03.432
'cause you get to meet
everybody you ever thought

1063
00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:07.811
you wanted to meet
and they want to meet you.

1064
00:44:07.853 --> 00:44:11.607
John lived his life
in these eight-hour shifts.

1065
00:44:11.649 --> 00:44:14.068
and if you were with him
for eight hours.

1066
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:16.695
you thought. "Well. God.
he must be exhausted.

1067
00:44:16.737 --> 00:44:18.364
But I'm going to bed."

1068
00:44:18.405 --> 00:44:20.282
But then there was
a whole other group of people

1069
00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:21.742
that he hung out with.

1070
00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:24.495
[Judy]  John and Danny both
were at a point

1071
00:44:24.536 --> 00:44:25.579
where they were famous.

1072
00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:28.415
and so their lives
were no longer the same.

1073
00:44:28.457 --> 00:44:31.752
They couldn't just go to a bar
somewhere and sit around.

1074
00:44:31.794 --> 00:44:34.296
That was no longer
a comfortable reality

1075
00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:36.965
because people were on them
all the time.

1076
00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:39.843
[Mitch]  Do you remember
when the Blues Bar opened?

1077
00:44:39.885 --> 00:44:41.095
[John]
Oh. yeah.

1078
00:44:41.136 --> 00:44:42.721
[Mitch]  You were there
for opening night. right?

1079
00:44:42.763 --> 00:44:44.848
- [John]  Oh. yeah.
- [indistinct chatter]

1080
00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:48.852
[Mitch]  John and Danny's
Blues Bar was such a shithole

1081
00:44:48.894 --> 00:44:51.355
that it took my breath away.

1082
00:44:51.397 --> 00:44:53.399
It was tiny. it stunk.

1083
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.818
and also had
the most terrifying bathroom

1084
00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:57.945
I've ever seen in my life.

1085
00:44:57.986 --> 00:44:58.987
[toilet flushes]

1086
00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:01.824
But it was the most
spectacular jukebox.

1087
00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:03.742
And I remember Keith Richards
being there.

1088
00:45:03.784 --> 00:45:06.954
and the Allmans would
kind of set up in one corner

1089
00:45:06.995 --> 00:45:10.332
and Francis Ford Coppola
and Danny tending bar.

1090
00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:11.875
There was no money
changing hands.

1091
00:45:11.917 --> 00:45:15.212
There was nothing sinister.
It was their fantasy.

1092
00:45:15.254 --> 00:45:16.380
And it instantly became

1093
00:45:16.422 --> 00:45:19.341
the coolest party
in the history of New York.

1094
00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.342
Oh. freedom

1095
00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:22.594
[Lorne]
It was a very heady time.

1096
00:45:22.636 --> 00:45:25.806
and I think he started
to lose his balance a little.

1097
00:45:25.848 --> 00:45:28.976
[telephone rings]

1098
00:45:29.017 --> 00:45:30.102
[Jane]
Hello?

1099
00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:32.062
[John]  Hi. Jane.
This is John.

1100
00:45:32.104 --> 00:45:35.190
- John Belushi.
- Hi. John! How are you?

1101
00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.109
[John]  Not too good. actually.
[chuckles]

1102
00:45:37.151 --> 00:45:39.778
You probably noticed I haven't
been in the show yet.

1103
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.739
Well. I just wanted
to tell everyone

1104
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.699
that I am in the hospital.

1105
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:47.870
I hurt my leg.
but I will be back next week

1106
00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:49.288
with or without my leg.

1107
00:45:49.329 --> 00:45:50.789
[Jane]
Uh-huh.

1108
00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:52.583
[Judy]
John began doing lectures

1109
00:45:52.624 --> 00:45:56.003
at colleges with Danny.
and on this particular show.

1110
00:45:56.044 --> 00:45:57.087
for whatever reason.

1111
00:45:57.129 --> 00:45:59.131
he decided
to jump off the stage.

1112
00:45:59.173 --> 00:46:02.760
and he broke the cartilage
in his knee.

1113
00:46:02.801 --> 00:46:04.845
He was put on painkillers.

1114
00:46:04.887 --> 00:46:07.598
and when they stopped
the painkillers.

1115
00:46:07.639 --> 00:46:10.768
he was not ready to stop.

1116
00:46:10.809 --> 00:46:13.729
And it got pretty out
of control.

1117
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:15.606
[Lorne]  Look. I can't put
this man on television.

1118
00:46:15.647 --> 00:46:16.690
He's barely awake.

1119
00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:20.194
Lorne.
if John Belushi could speak.

1120
00:46:20.235 --> 00:46:22.696
he'd tell you he's got
to go on.

1121
00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:23.864
Doc. I-I-I-I don't understand.

1122
00:46:23.906 --> 00:46:27.493
Why are you so convinced
that this man can do a show?

1123
00:46:27.534 --> 00:46:28.660
[chuckling]
Well...

1124
00:46:28.702 --> 00:46:30.746
to be perfectly honest.
it's about my fee.

1125
00:46:30.788 --> 00:46:32.080
[Tanner]
In the second year.

1126
00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.749
your prediction
that John would be trouble

1127
00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:35.793
- sort of came to fruition.
- [Lorne]  Yeah.

1128
00:46:35.834 --> 00:46:38.670
And if he doesn't get paid.
I don't get paid.

1129
00:46:38.712 --> 00:46:40.881
And if I don't get paid.

1130
00:46:40.923 --> 00:46:44.343
I'll be forced
to cut off his drugs.

1131
00:46:44.384 --> 00:46:48.055
Live from New York.
it's  Saturday Night!

1132
00:46:48.096 --> 00:46:50.432
[Lorne]  He was testing all
the boundaries at that point.

1133
00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:52.684
The boundaries
of his relationship with Judy.

1134
00:46:52.726 --> 00:46:54.520
definitely with everyone
at the show.

1135
00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:59.191
Well. let them take you
for a clown

1136
00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:02.319
And they're bound
to bring you down

1137
00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:04.196
You got to make it
through the world...

1138
00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:05.948
[Judy]
I'd come up to the show.

1139
00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:07.407
and I was walking
into the studio.

1140
00:47:07.449 --> 00:47:09.952
and there's bleachers there.
and as I got in and under.

1141
00:47:09.993 --> 00:47:12.579
I saw that John and some woman
were kissing.

1142
00:47:12.621 --> 00:47:15.290
And he saw me
and came right after me.

1143
00:47:15.332 --> 00:47:16.375
and he grabbed me and said.

1144
00:47:16.416 --> 00:47:18.877
"I swear to God.
she just kissed me."

1145
00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:21.213
[Anne]  He would be late.
He would be erratic. you know?

1146
00:47:21.255 --> 00:47:23.882
He did have difficulties.
obviously.

1147
00:47:23.924 --> 00:47:25.968
I mean.
the phrase "where's John?"

1148
00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.970
was said as frequently
in rehearsals

1149
00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:31.932
as. "Live from New York.
it's  Saturday Night."

1150
00:47:31.974 --> 00:47:34.059
[Jane]  It was difficult
working with John.

1151
00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:38.647
I don't know whether it was
ego or ambition or the drugs.

1152
00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:43.235
but he didn't seem to respect
the women on the show.

1153
00:47:43.277 --> 00:47:46.196
[Judy]  He was very hard
on two of the women writers

1154
00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:48.532
and kind of just made it
a categorical.

1155
00:47:48.574 --> 00:47:49.825
"I don't like their work.

1156
00:47:49.867 --> 00:47:51.994
I don't want to do their work"
kind of thing.

1157
00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:54.246
And. of course.
they often wrote for Gilda.

1158
00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:57.791
and I think she felt
he was being mean and unfair.

1159
00:47:57.833 --> 00:47:59.459
[Anne]  Even so.
John would do stuff

1160
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:01.587
like refusing to be in things
we wrote

1161
00:48:01.628 --> 00:48:03.922
and saying that girls
weren't funny.

1162
00:48:03.964 --> 00:48:05.090
And I mean. believe me.

1163
00:48:05.132 --> 00:48:07.885
all those men who
are accusing John of sexism.

1164
00:48:07.926 --> 00:48:11.513
I don't think their records
are too clear either.

1165
00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:15.559
[Lorne]  John had to always look
like he was the boss.

1166
00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:18.562
It was a. you know.
a descent into hell.

1167
00:48:18.604 --> 00:48:20.564
I'll just leave it at that.

1168
00:48:20.606 --> 00:48:22.274
If you can

1169
00:48:22.316 --> 00:48:24.318
[match strikes and hisses]

1170
00:48:24.359 --> 00:48:26.361
[Judy]
During that second season.

1171
00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:28.780
it just seemed
we were slipping apart.

1172
00:48:28.822 --> 00:48:30.282
He was being distant.

1173
00:48:30.324 --> 00:48:34.411
not responsive to concerns
I had about his drug use.

1174
00:48:34.453 --> 00:48:37.831
And I began to not trust
what he was telling me.

1175
00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:41.960
He wasn't following through
enough with things he said.

1176
00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:44.046
I felt I wasn't important
anymore.

1177
00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:48.050
and it didn't feel like
his interest was with me.

1178
00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:52.638
and that's really pretty much
why we split.

1179
00:48:52.679 --> 00:48:54.181
So he went to LA.

1180
00:48:54.222 --> 00:48:56.683
[Bob] I'm the head
of the John Belushi fan club.

1181
00:48:56.725 --> 00:48:58.477
Yes. how's that?

1182
00:48:58.518 --> 00:48:59.519
[John]
What's this for?

1183
00:48:59.561 --> 00:49:02.147
We're making a documentary
about him.

1184
00:49:02.189 --> 00:49:03.190
You know Sally Kirkland?

1185
00:49:03.231 --> 00:49:04.858
[John]
No. I don't.

1186
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.401
- She's a sweetheart.
- She is a sweetheart.

1187
00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:08.946
We're making it about people
who are about to make it.

1188
00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:10.948
who didn't make it.
who are gonna make it.

1189
00:49:10.989 --> 00:49:12.199
Now. here's Bob. right?

1190
00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.952
He's been in Hollywood for
two years from Brooklyn. right?

1191
00:49:14.993 --> 00:49:15.911
[John]
Y-yeah?

1192
00:49:15.953 --> 00:49:17.371
And all of a sudden.
he's a big star.

1193
00:49:17.412 --> 00:49:18.497
[Bob]
I'm not a big star.

1194
00:49:18.538 --> 00:49:20.624
That word
is not real anymore. man.

1195
00:49:20.666 --> 00:49:21.959
He probably has more to say.

1196
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.877
That show's a hit.
and he's the biggest hit--

1197
00:49:23.919 --> 00:49:25.921
I was telling him
the first night

1198
00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:27.089
that you came to Hollywood

1199
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:29.883
and you said.
"My God. should I shave?"

1200
00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:31.259
- [chuckles]
- Right?

1201
00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:33.178
'Cause all of a sudden.
everybody knows you.

1202
00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:35.847
And they didn't know you the
last time you were here. right?

1203
00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:38.350
Uh. no--
oh. my friends knew me.

1204
00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:40.060
[interviewer] Well. I'm not
talking about your friends.

1205
00:49:40.102 --> 00:49:41.895
I'm talking about people
just walking in the door

1206
00:49:41.937 --> 00:49:43.981
- at the Comedy Canteen.
- No.

1207
00:49:44.022 --> 00:49:45.857
No. they didn't know me. no.

1208
00:49:45.899 --> 00:49:47.734
[interviewer]
But they did this time?

1209
00:49:47.776 --> 00:49:50.070
Some knew me.
Some...

1210
00:49:50.112 --> 00:49:52.239
will never know me.

1211
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.741
Some don't care.

1212
00:49:54.783 --> 00:49:57.494
psychedelic music

1213
00:49:57.536 --> 00:49:59.246
[John]
Dearest Judy.

1214
00:49:59.287 --> 00:50:01.915
I've never doubted
your love for me.

1215
00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:04.459
I have doubted your faith
in me.

1216
00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:07.254
Experience
has taught you that.

1217
00:50:07.295 --> 00:50:08.505
When I dislike myself.

1218
00:50:08.547 --> 00:50:10.799
I think the people who like me
are fools

1219
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:13.552
to like an asshole like me.

1220
00:50:13.593 --> 00:50:17.556
I know I'm inconsistent.
I work very hard.

1221
00:50:17.597 --> 00:50:19.683
I don't want
to be like my dad.

1222
00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:24.521
He never talked to my mom.
I am better. aren't I?

1223
00:50:24.563 --> 00:50:25.731
I'm trying to be clear.

1224
00:50:25.772 --> 00:50:28.442
but it's hard to understand
and explain.

1225
00:50:28.483 --> 00:50:31.778
Maybe it's nothing.
a coke paranoia.

1226
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.489
I want to be with you
for the rest of my life.

1227
00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:37.659
but I don't think
you believe me.

1228
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:40.912
I know what I'd like to do
after we talk more.

1229
00:50:40.954 --> 00:50:42.581
One. buy new clothes.

1230
00:50:42.622 --> 00:50:45.959
Two. stay away from drugs
and drug people.

1231
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:48.336
Three. try to exercise.
Four. lose weight.

1232
00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:49.921
Five. stay home with you
and talk.

1233
00:50:49.963 --> 00:50:52.799
Six. go out more with you.
Seven. stop seeing others.

1234
00:50:52.841 --> 00:50:54.718
Eight. understand
other's needs.

1235
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:56.094
Nine. be happy.

1236
00:50:56.136 --> 00:50:59.014
Ten. love you.

1237
00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:01.683
Please. let's talk.

1238
00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:03.643
harmonica music

1239
00:51:03.685 --> 00:51:06.229
[Judy]  For about a month.
we didn't live together.

1240
00:51:06.271 --> 00:51:10.484
and then one day.
he came back.

1241
00:51:10.525 --> 00:51:12.402
He convinced me
that he loved me

1242
00:51:12.444 --> 00:51:16.323
and that he couldn't always do
what I was hoping.

1243
00:51:16.364 --> 00:51:18.241
but this time was unique

1244
00:51:18.283 --> 00:51:21.328
and that we were gonna change
our trajectory.

1245
00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:26.541
We decided to go to Aspen
for vacation.

1246
00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:27.876
My brother lived in Aspen.

1247
00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:29.211
and I heard him tell
my brother

1248
00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:31.797
we were gonna get married
while we were there.

1249
00:51:31.838 --> 00:51:34.257
Meanwhile. I personally
had forgotten

1250
00:51:34.299 --> 00:51:35.634
the idea of getting married

1251
00:51:35.675 --> 00:51:37.677
because of the way things
had just sort of all gone.

1252
00:51:37.719 --> 00:51:39.596
I said. "John.
I heard you say to my brother

1253
00:51:39.638 --> 00:51:40.847
that we were gonna
get married."

1254
00:51:40.889 --> 00:51:42.766
And he said. "Well. yeah.
Aren't we?"

1255
00:51:42.808 --> 00:51:45.894
dark rock music

1256
00:51:50.524 --> 00:51:53.401
[John]
My dear sweet Judy.

1257
00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:55.112
a letter is so inadequate

1258
00:51:55.153 --> 00:51:58.115
to explain how I feel
about you.

1259
00:51:58.156 --> 00:52:01.159
It's just there.
living inside of me.

1260
00:52:01.201 --> 00:52:05.622
a living organism
that I need to live.

1261
00:52:05.664 --> 00:52:09.376
To my first
and only Valentine forever.

1262
00:52:09.417 --> 00:52:10.961
Love. John.

1263
00:52:13.004 --> 00:52:17.050
[Rosie]  He was obviously
experiencing some wild peaks

1264
00:52:17.092 --> 00:52:18.969
and some dark troughs.

1265
00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:21.179
[Tanner]  And then he
and Judy got married.

1266
00:52:21.221 --> 00:52:22.681
and things really
settled down.

1267
00:52:22.722 --> 00:52:23.723
[Rosie]
Exactly.

1268
00:52:23.765 --> 00:52:26.893
It just seemed
like he needed that.

1269
00:52:42.117 --> 00:52:45.203
[Harold]  I went to visit John
at  Saturday Night.

1270
00:52:45.245 --> 00:52:47.205
and I remember walking down
the street

1271
00:52:47.247 --> 00:52:49.833
with all these people I'd been
with when we had nothing.

1272
00:52:49.875 --> 00:52:52.127
when just having a job
was good enough.

1273
00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:54.045
And now I looked behind us.

1274
00:52:54.087 --> 00:52:57.048
and limousines were slowly
following us down the street.

1275
00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.091
you know?

1276
00:52:58.133 --> 00:53:00.051
Seemed like
they were the beginnings

1277
00:53:00.093 --> 00:53:03.054
of a kind of wretched excess.

1278
00:53:03.096 --> 00:53:04.264
You know. for John.

1279
00:53:04.306 --> 00:53:07.475
who lived for so long
with some sense of destiny.

1280
00:53:07.517 --> 00:53:10.228
what was kind of a hopeful
arrogance. you know.

1281
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:12.731
turned into a kind
of expectation

1282
00:53:12.772 --> 00:53:15.358
of his own success.

1283
00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.236
And that was before
Animal House.

1284
00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:22.574
All right. you bastard.
Let's go. right here!

1285
00:53:22.616 --> 00:53:23.992
upbeat oldies music

1286
00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:26.828
Hey. baby. won't you take
a chance...

1287
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.331
- Food fight!
- [students clamoring]

1288
00:53:29.372 --> 00:53:31.416
[Harold]
My wife at that time said.

1289
00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:33.168
"You've always wanted
to write a movie

1290
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:34.377
about your college
experience."

1291
00:53:34.419 --> 00:53:36.254
So Doug Kenney and I
started writing.

1292
00:53:36.296 --> 00:53:37.923
and then Doug and I recruited
Chris Miller.

1293
00:53:37.964 --> 00:53:41.551
who was the  Lampoon's
resident college expert.

1294
00:53:41.593 --> 00:53:44.012
[Chris Miller]  One thing
about  Animal House  is that.

1295
00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:46.556
at the center
of every great animal house.

1296
00:53:46.598 --> 00:53:48.350
there was a great animal.

1297
00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:50.936
And we looked at each other
for a beat.

1298
00:53:50.977 --> 00:53:54.356
and we all simultaneously
said. "Belushi."

1299
00:53:54.397 --> 00:53:57.901
[glass shatters. cans rattle]

1300
00:53:57.943 --> 00:53:59.861
[Landis]  And the script
wasn't designed

1301
00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:01.529
for Bluto to burst through.

1302
00:54:01.571 --> 00:54:03.531
It's just. John burst through.

1303
00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:07.369
Mr. Blutarsky...

1304
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:10.789
zero-point-zero.

1305
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:12.540
He's the ladies' man

1306
00:54:12.582 --> 00:54:15.168
Was it over when the Germans
bombed Pearl Harbor?

1307
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:17.879
- "Germans"?
- Forget it. He's rolling.

1308
00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:20.465
Let's do it!

1309
00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:23.510
[men shouting]

1310
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:25.929
Holy shit!

1311
00:54:25.971 --> 00:54:27.555
Animal house

1312
00:54:28.974 --> 00:54:32.310
Seven years of college
down the drain.

1313
00:54:32.352 --> 00:54:33.770
Animal house

1314
00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:34.896
[Landis]
In the script.

1315
00:54:34.938 --> 00:54:36.648
John's character
had much more dialogue

1316
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.275
than he does in the movie.

1317
00:54:38.316 --> 00:54:40.235
I took most of his lines away

1318
00:54:40.277 --> 00:54:42.779
because this idea of Bluto
as kind of--

1319
00:54:42.821 --> 00:54:44.364
you know.
I told him to channel

1320
00:54:44.406 --> 00:54:46.574
Harpo Marx
and the Cookie Monster.

1321
00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:47.993
It's just appetite.

1322
00:54:48.034 --> 00:54:49.786
Don't know much biology...

1323
00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:52.038
[Landis]  And what Belushi had
that was so great--

1324
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.207
you actually can watch
his thought process.

1325
00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:55.500
[chuckles]
You know.

1326
00:54:55.542 --> 00:54:58.628
you can see the ideas seeping
through his skull.

1327
00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.005
[slurps]

1328
00:55:00.046 --> 00:55:03.675
[Landis]  But what both the
Cookie Monster and Harpo have.

1329
00:55:03.717 --> 00:55:05.802
despite their
destructive tendencies.

1330
00:55:05.844 --> 00:55:08.388
is they're both very.
very sweet.

1331
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.807
and that's the strength
of John's performance.

1332
00:55:14.269 --> 00:55:16.438
- [car slams into wall]
- Good.

1333
00:55:16.479 --> 00:55:18.106
[Flounder sobbing]

1334
00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:20.984
[Landis]  And a lot of the
stuff that people remember

1335
00:55:21.026 --> 00:55:22.027
is just John.

1336
00:55:22.068 --> 00:55:25.280
- Hey.
- [Flounder sobs]

1337
00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:26.573
[Landis]
There was a scene

1338
00:55:26.614 --> 00:55:29.242
where he's cheering up
Flounder.

1339
00:55:29.284 --> 00:55:31.786
To me.
it's this examination of John.

1340
00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:33.079
[smooching]

1341
00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:35.957
[Landis]  Because he really did
want you to have a good time.

1342
00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:38.043
and he could do
the most outrageous

1343
00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:40.795
and totally
unforgivable behavior...

1344
00:55:40.837 --> 00:55:41.838
[crying]

1345
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:45.383
[Landis]  ...because he was
so damn charming.

1346
00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:52.140
[Ivan]  John came to this movie
ready to work.

1347
00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:55.268
He went there with Judy.
They rented a great house.

1348
00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:57.270
It was a very familial affair.

1349
00:55:57.312 --> 00:55:59.773
He was there
with all guns blasting.

1350
00:55:59.814 --> 00:56:01.232
He was very creative.

1351
00:56:01.274 --> 00:56:05.862
There was no weirdness;
there was no acting out.

1352
00:56:05.904 --> 00:56:07.030
[Bruce]
John. you know.

1353
00:56:07.072 --> 00:56:08.948
thought of himself
as a physical God.

1354
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:10.700
I think he probably
would've thought

1355
00:56:10.742 --> 00:56:13.995
he could be a ballet dancer
if somebody asked him to.

1356
00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:15.622
But he always
introduced me as.

1357
00:56:15.663 --> 00:56:18.166
"Oh. this is my friend Bruce.
He's a great actor."

1358
00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:19.417
And after a while.
I said.

1359
00:56:19.459 --> 00:56:21.211
"John. why do you make
that distinction?

1360
00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:23.213
You're an actor. I'm an actor.
What's the deal?"

1361
00:56:23.254 --> 00:56:24.923
He said.
"Oh. no. I'm a sketch player."

1362
00:56:24.964 --> 00:56:27.008
And I think that's one
of the things that drove John

1363
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:30.220
and frustrated him so.
is that he was so talented

1364
00:56:30.261 --> 00:56:32.555
and what he did came
so naturally

1365
00:56:32.597 --> 00:56:35.433
and without apparent effort
on his part

1366
00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:36.810
that he kept thinking

1367
00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:39.604
somebody was gonna find out he
wasn't really doing anything.

1368
00:56:39.646 --> 00:56:40.814
He was just cutting up.

1369
00:56:40.855 --> 00:56:42.315
The deal is he was cutting up

1370
00:56:42.357 --> 00:56:45.235
as one of the world's most
talented physical comics ever.

1371
00:56:46.945 --> 00:56:48.988
[interviewer]  How do you think
the movie is coming along?

1372
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.989
Are you pleased with it?

1373
00:56:50.031 --> 00:56:51.282
[John]
I'm very pleased with it.

1374
00:56:51.324 --> 00:56:54.285
I think it's the best thing
I've ever done.

1375
00:56:54.327 --> 00:56:56.621
[Ivan]  It was really one of
the most remarkable previews

1376
00:56:56.663 --> 00:56:57.747
I'd ever gone to.

1377
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:59.874
I've had some very big hits
since then.

1378
00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:03.169
but I've still never had
a screening like that one.

1379
00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:04.254
[urine splattering]

1380
00:57:04.295 --> 00:57:06.798
Excuse me. sir.
Is this the Delta house?

1381
00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:09.759
- Sure.
- [urine splattering on fabric]

1382
00:57:09.801 --> 00:57:10.802
[zipper closes]

1383
00:57:10.844 --> 00:57:12.137
Come on in.

1384
00:57:12.178 --> 00:57:15.306
[Ivan]  From the moment Belushi
appeared on the screen

1385
00:57:15.348 --> 00:57:17.767
and peed
on the freshmen's trousers.

1386
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:20.311
the audience went crazy
and didn't stop going crazy.

1387
00:57:20.353 --> 00:57:22.105
and if they could've torn
seats out.

1388
00:57:22.147 --> 00:57:23.356
literally.
they would have.

1389
00:57:23.398 --> 00:57:24.899
[Shalit]
What about  Animal House?

1390
00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:29.028
It's a comedy that I did.
and it's coming out today.

1391
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:32.782
It's a stroll down memory lane
with a blowtorch.

1392
00:57:32.824 --> 00:57:34.826
Toga! Toga!

1393
00:57:34.868 --> 00:57:37.537
[all chanting]
Toga. toga. toga!

1394
00:57:37.579 --> 00:57:38.621
[reporter]
It is toga fever.

1395
00:57:38.663 --> 00:57:40.665
and it is sweeping
college campuses

1396
00:57:40.707 --> 00:57:42.083
throughout the country.

1397
00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:44.544
[Landis]  Something
that happened to John

1398
00:57:44.586 --> 00:57:46.171
is instant stardom.

1399
00:57:46.212 --> 00:57:48.756
I mean. he was
a television personality

1400
00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:51.342
on a late-night fringe show.

1401
00:57:51.384 --> 00:57:54.596
and then out of this movie
comes this stardom.

1402
00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:56.556
and that's terrifying.

1403
00:57:56.598 --> 00:57:59.767
[Sean]  Around the movie.
there was this craze.

1404
00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.728
So  Newsweek
put him on the cover.

1405
00:58:01.769 --> 00:58:03.146
That was certainly.
you know.

1406
00:58:03.188 --> 00:58:05.648
turning him
into a famous face.

1407
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:08.234
It's more difficult
after that.

1408
00:58:08.276 --> 00:58:10.778
[Laila]  John was way more
comfortable onstage

1409
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.572
than anywhere else.

1410
00:58:12.614 --> 00:58:13.781
And I always said to him.

1411
00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:15.241
"I don't understand
how you can do that.

1412
00:58:15.283 --> 00:58:18.328
Get up on the stage.
you have no fear whatsoever."

1413
00:58:18.369 --> 00:58:19.454
And he always said.

1414
00:58:19.496 --> 00:58:21.456
"Yeah. but you do the thing
that I can't do.

1415
00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:23.458
"which is you're
more comfortable in life.

1416
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.585
I don't know how you do that."

1417
00:58:25.627 --> 00:58:27.378
[Penny]  He didn't really talk
to me about the difference

1418
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.381
between movie stardom and
television stardom or that.

1419
00:58:30.423 --> 00:58:32.926
He did want to conquer
all mediums.

1420
00:58:32.967 --> 00:58:34.594
I think one
of his biggest prides

1421
00:58:34.636 --> 00:58:37.263
was his success
with the Blues Brothers act.

1422
00:58:37.305 --> 00:58:41.267
He was just ecstatic.

1423
00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:51.653
[emcee]  We're very fortunate
to have this person with us--

1424
00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:54.489
Mr. John Belushi.
Can we bring him out here?

1425
00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:55.657
[cheers and applause]

1426
00:58:55.698 --> 00:58:57.408
Johnny Lee's
"Hey Bartender"

1427
00:58:57.450 --> 00:59:00.787
Went partying
the other night

1428
00:59:00.828 --> 00:59:04.040
Started drinking
and got real tight

1429
00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:07.669
I blew each
and all my friends

1430
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:11.089
Felt so good.
I had to blow again

1431
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:13.258
I said. "Hey. bartender"

1432
00:59:13.299 --> 00:59:14.634
[John]
I got turned on to blues

1433
00:59:14.676 --> 00:59:16.052
when I was filming
Animal House.

1434
00:59:16.094 --> 00:59:18.513
I mean. really into it.
you know what I mean?

1435
00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:20.890
So I've spent the last year
trying to learn

1436
00:59:20.932 --> 00:59:23.643
as much as I could.
you know. about blues.

1437
00:59:23.685 --> 00:59:25.687
One more time!

1438
00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.188
I'd carry albums with me.

1439
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.023
When I would just go see
somebody or I'd go to work.

1440
00:59:29.065 --> 00:59:32.235
listening--I mean. I'd drive
my friends nuts. you know?

1441
00:59:32.277 --> 00:59:34.404
Draw a-one. two

1442
00:59:34.445 --> 00:59:37.824
Three more glasses of beer

1443
00:59:41.703 --> 00:59:43.997
- [glass shatters]
- [cheers and applause]

1444
00:59:44.038 --> 00:59:45.123
[Laila]
He said to me.

1445
00:59:45.164 --> 00:59:46.833
"We're gonna do
the Blues Brothers.

1446
00:59:46.874 --> 00:59:49.002
We're gonna do. like. a band."

1447
00:59:49.043 --> 00:59:52.046
And he got Danny
to play harmonica. you know?

1448
00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:55.383
And then he said. "Okay. Judy.
you're gonna be the designer

1449
00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:57.260
and. Laila. you're gonna be
the president

1450
00:59:57.302 --> 00:59:58.386
of the Blues Brothers.

1451
00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.346
and you're gonna put it
all together."

1452
01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:02.932
I think John used the blues
as a way

1453
01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.684
to keep everybody together.

1454
01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:06.686
[Tanner]
To sort of create a family?

1455
01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:07.895
[Laila]
Yes.

1456
01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:10.732
[Aykroyd]  You know.
it was a real common effort.

1457
01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.317
but mainly led by John.
you know? He really--

1458
01:00:12.358 --> 01:00:14.444
It came out of trust
and people saying. you know.

1459
01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:16.195
they weren't sure what it was.

1460
01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:17.280
I knew what it was.

1461
01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:18.531
I knew exactly
what it was gonna be.

1462
01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:20.325
[Aykroyd]
But they all showed up.

1463
01:00:20.366 --> 01:00:22.493
We got the best musicians
in the world.

1464
01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:25.455
Went partying
the other night

1465
01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:28.791
Started drinking
and got real tight

1466
01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:32.170
I blew each
and all my friends

1467
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:35.590
Felt so good.
I had to blow again

1468
01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:36.591
I said. hey...

1469
01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:37.925
[Laila]
A lot of people thought

1470
01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:39.469
that it was kind of a joke.

1471
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:40.762
I don't think people realized

1472
01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:43.264
that we really had
a great band

1473
01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.932
and that John
could really sing.

1474
01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:47.101
Three more glasses of beer

1475
01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:51.939
[Laila]
Once we actually performed.

1476
01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.692
I think we put to rest
that it wasn't a joke.

1477
01:00:54.734 --> 01:00:58.988
and it was a love of the music
that was driving John.

1478
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:02.241
Come on down
and drink with me

1479
01:01:02.283 --> 01:01:04.577
I said. "Hey. bartender"

1480
01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:06.037
[Aykroyd]  The whole thing.
it's a theatrical thing.

1481
01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.539
Like. you know. Greek theater
has the mask. you know?

1482
01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:10.750
Well. the Blues Brothers have
the shades and the suits.

1483
01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:14.045
[John]  So it basically looks
like '50s hipster junkie.

1484
01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.171
[Aykroyd]
They look like cops.

1485
01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:16.673
They look like hit men.
you know?

1486
01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:18.007
[John]  Rabbis.
Some guys thought--

1487
01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:19.759
[Aykroyd]  But the fact is
that Jake and Elwood

1488
01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:20.927
aren't any of those things.

1489
01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:23.137
They're just. like. musicians.
you know?

1490
01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.200
Well...

1491
01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:45.785
[interviewer]  And here you are
on television every week.

1492
01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:47.912
What I'm getting from you is
that underneath it all of it.

1493
01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:50.206
the biggest fantasy is
to be a rock-and-roll star.

1494
01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.458
- That's it. pal.
- [laughter]

1495
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.378
Hey. bartender

1496
01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.881
Hey.
bartender

1497
01:01:58.923 --> 01:02:02.051
Hey. bartender

1498
01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.803
Draw a-one. two

1499
01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:07.598
Three more glasses of beer

1500
01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:16.399
[cheers and applause]

1501
01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:19.485
[Judy]  Atlantic Records wanted
to do a live album.

1502
01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:22.822
and that first night
at Universal Amphitheatre.

1503
01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:25.158
the crowd was just wild.

1504
01:02:25.199 --> 01:02:27.994
You know. John had loved being
in a band and wanted a band.

1505
01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:30.580
and now he had a band.

1506
01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:33.875
The best band in the world.
[chuckles]

1507
01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:37.712
And I just thought.
"My God. they did it."

1508
01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.840
The Blues Brothers'
"She Caught the Katy"

1509
01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:43.926
We recorded the album.
and it was released

1510
01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:47.847
and pretty quickly went
to number one.

1511
01:02:47.889 --> 01:02:50.516
triumphant blues music

1512
01:02:58.149 --> 01:03:00.693
She caught the Katy

1513
01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.528
And left me a mule...

1514
01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.906
[Mitch]  That's when
the  1941  deal came down.

1515
01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:06.616
and he turned to me and said.
"It's done.

1516
01:03:06.657 --> 01:03:08.451
You know. I'm working
with Spielberg.

1517
01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.578
and I think
this means I'm set."

1518
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.956
And left me a mule to ride

1519
01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:19.712
My baby caught the Katy...

1520
01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:21.506
[Mark]
Boy. you must be a busy guy.

1521
01:03:21.547 --> 01:03:23.257
You do  Saturday Night Live;
you have time for movies;

1522
01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:25.384
you have time for
the Blues Brothers projects.

1523
01:03:25.426 --> 01:03:27.553
[John]  Plus. I mean. I'm a
night manager at Burger King.

1524
01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:30.223
I have to keep working.
You know. I'm like a shark.

1525
01:03:30.264 --> 01:03:31.766
If I stop. I'll die.

1526
01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:32.850
[host]
John? Hello?

1527
01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:33.935
[John]
Hello. hello. hello!

1528
01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:35.269
- [caller]  Hello.
- [John]  Hello!

1529
01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:36.604
[host]
So why did you call. dear?

1530
01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:37.855
[caller]
I called because

1531
01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:39.857
he's the greatest guy
on  Saturday Night Live.

1532
01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:41.108
[John]
Aw.

1533
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:42.652
[caller]  If he just keeps on
doing what he's doing.

1534
01:03:42.693 --> 01:03:44.612
he's gonna make so many people
in the world so happy.

1535
01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:45.988
[John]  Well. I hope so.
Thank you.

1536
01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:47.657
[host]  Thank you. All right.
Let's take another call.

1537
01:03:47.698 --> 01:03:49.408
Let's see.
Hello?

1538
01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:50.743
[Judy]
On his 30th birthday.

1539
01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.453
the Blues Brothers
were number one.

1540
01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.747
he was on the number one
television show.

1541
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:58.876
and  Animal House  was the
number one grossing comedy.

1542
01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:01.003
He was high on his success.

1543
01:04:01.045 --> 01:04:04.841
but he was unsure
of what people wanted from him

1544
01:04:04.882 --> 01:04:06.384
and how to relate to people.

1545
01:04:06.425 --> 01:04:07.760
[host]  All right. one more.
Hello.

1546
01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:09.262
- [caller]  Hello?
- [John]  Hello!

1547
01:04:09.303 --> 01:04:11.639
[Judy]  That was
a difficult change for him.

1548
01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:12.765
[host]
BCN here.

1549
01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:14.433
[caller]
Yes. I have one question.

1550
01:04:14.475 --> 01:04:15.726
[John]
Yeah. sure.

1551
01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:17.144
[caller]  What is your drug
of preference?

1552
01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:18.062
[John]
Uh...

1553
01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:19.230
[host]
That's a good question.

1554
01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:21.065
Go ahead. John.
You can answer that.

1555
01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.650
[John]
Um...

1556
01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.819
I don't--I don't--
I don't tell people that.

1557
01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.320
- [host]  Right.
- [John chuckles]

1558
01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:28.322
That's a very good answer.

1559
01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:32.451
[Tony]  He was a very
American-like force.

1560
01:04:32.493 --> 01:04:35.037
I felt that
what made you laugh about John

1561
01:04:35.079 --> 01:04:36.581
was peculiarly American.

1562
01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:38.791
The raw energy
of this country

1563
01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:41.711
was summed up
in the way he hit the stage.

1564
01:04:41.752 --> 01:04:43.212
but at the same time.
I've always felt

1565
01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:46.215
that there's an enormous void
at the center of America.

1566
01:04:46.257 --> 01:04:49.218
a void that has to do with
promise and disappointment

1567
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.138
and impossible expectations.

1568
01:04:52.179 --> 01:04:55.474
Behind all this energy
comes what?

1569
01:04:55.516 --> 01:04:59.687
The American dream
is ultimately just a dream.

1570
01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.608
When you finally get where
you're going. what then?

1571
01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:07.904
[telephone rings]

1572
01:05:07.945 --> 01:05:09.405
Hello?
Olympia Restaurant.

1573
01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:10.573
[fry cook]
Cheeseburger. cheeseburger.

1574
01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:12.825
- Two Pepsi. one chip!
- Yeah. To go?

1575
01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:14.243
Four cheeseburger.

1576
01:05:14.285 --> 01:05:16.495
Cheeseburger. cheeseburger.
cheeseburger. cheeseburger.

1577
01:05:16.537 --> 01:05:18.706
Cheeseburger. cheeseburger.
cheeseburger. cheeseburger.

1578
01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.291
No--no fries.
Chips.

1579
01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:21.751
[Jim Belushi]
The one character

1580
01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:23.920
that I know definitely comes
from. you know. the family

1581
01:05:23.961 --> 01:05:25.922
is the "cheeseburger.
cheeseburger" guy.

1582
01:05:25.963 --> 01:05:28.758
No Coke. no orange. no grape?
Okay.

1583
01:05:28.799 --> 01:05:31.594
[Jim Belushi]  When I watched
the character. I went.

1584
01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:33.471
"My God. that's my dad."

1585
01:05:33.512 --> 01:05:37.850
I don't want a cheeseburger.
Eggs over lightly with sausage.

1586
01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:41.228
No. no. no. no; no eggs.
Cheeseburger.

1587
01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:42.855
You stopped serving breakfast?

1588
01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:44.065
No.
No breakfast.

1589
01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.483
- No breakfast?
- No.

1590
01:05:45.524 --> 01:05:48.027
All right.
I just want a couple eggs.

1591
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.987
No breakfast.
Cheeseburger. huh?

1592
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:51.030
I don't want a cheeseburger.

1593
01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:52.198
It's too early
for a cheeseburger.

1594
01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:54.116
Too early for cheeseburger?
Look.

1595
01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:55.284
Cheeseburger.
cheeseburger.

1596
01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:56.661
cheeseburger. cheeseburger.
cheeseburger.

1597
01:05:56.702 --> 01:05:59.205
[both] Cheeseburger.
cheeseburger. cheeseburger.

1598
01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:02.208
[laughter and applause]

1599
01:06:02.249 --> 01:06:03.626
I'll have a cheeseburger.

1600
01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:06.712
bluesy rock music

1601
01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:14.679
[family member] Here we are
up in Julian. California.

1602
01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:18.099
And up here coming towards us.
Adam Belushi.

1603
01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.851
[pants]
That's difficult.

1604
01:06:24.438 --> 01:06:27.024
[Judy]  With the first money
we really had.

1605
01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:28.526
one of the things we did

1606
01:06:28.567 --> 01:06:32.947
was to get a ranch
in California for his parents.

1607
01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.450
They weren't terribly close.
but he loved them.

1608
01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.995
and he wanted
to do nice things for 'em.

1609
01:06:40.454 --> 01:06:43.416
They were immigrants who.
in one generation. had a son

1610
01:06:43.457 --> 01:06:46.585
who had reached heights
they couldn't have imagined.

1611
01:06:46.627 --> 01:06:48.963
But it just didn't seem
to make a difference

1612
01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:51.632
to their relationship.

1613
01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:54.260
One of the things
that John struggled with

1614
01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:55.553
in his emotional life

1615
01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:58.347
was thinking
his parents weren't happy.

1616
01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:02.893
Adam seemed depressed.
and Agnes was up and down.

1617
01:07:02.935 --> 01:07:05.104
maybe bipolar.

1618
01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:06.897
He felt that his success

1619
01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:09.066
was supposed to help heal
the family.

1620
01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:12.153
yet he couldn't make that
happen.

1621
01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:14.572
It was very painful.

1622
01:07:14.613 --> 01:07:17.366
I think it really crushed him.

1623
01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:18.951
Hi. Jane.
How are you?

1624
01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:19.869
Hi. Dan.
Fine.

1625
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:21.537
- How's Patrick?
- He's good.

1626
01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:23.372
I hear John's still out
in California.

1627
01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:25.374
What's he doing.
eight to ten for possession?

1628
01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:27.543
No. no.
He's really quite sick.

1629
01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:30.087
He has a bad ear infection.
He can't go up in an airplane.

1630
01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:31.881
Like. he can't land. or his
ear drum will burst. so...

1631
01:07:31.922 --> 01:07:35.593
Oh. I sure hope he didn't catch
it listening to himself sing.

1632
01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:38.054
- I'll see you. Dan.
- Sure.

1633
01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:40.014
funky rock music

1634
01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:43.768
[Lorne]  In the course
of 20-some-odd shows a year.

1635
01:07:43.809 --> 01:07:44.894
now. suddenly.

1636
01:07:44.935 --> 01:07:49.440
John was often
a bigger star than the host.

1637
01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:50.858
He was making  1941.

1638
01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.527
There's a short film
that I've never run

1639
01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:55.071
with John sitting
around a pool.

1640
01:07:55.112 --> 01:07:58.199
'cause it was the one time
John missed a show.

1641
01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.492
[Tanner]
Right...

1642
01:07:59.533 --> 01:08:01.077
[Lorne]  ...because he broke
his leg or hurt his leg or--

1643
01:08:01.118 --> 01:08:02.745
- [Tanner]  An ear infection.
- [Lorne]  Whatever.

1644
01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:03.746
- Okay.
- [Tanner]  Yeah.

1645
01:08:03.788 --> 01:08:05.039
[Lorne]
Whatever it was.

1646
01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:06.332
he couldn't get on
the plane. blah. blah. blah.

1647
01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:07.875
And they made this film
for the show.

1648
01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.169
which was all
about kissing John's ass.

1649
01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:11.170
[Tanner]
Mm-hmm.

1650
01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:13.005
[Lorne]
I think we all just felt.

1651
01:08:13.047 --> 01:08:15.925
"Hey. you can't do this."

1652
01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:20.012
[Tanner]  Yeah.
everyone says that. you know.

1653
01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.056
people didn't realize his
problem was as bad as it was

1654
01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:24.391
because he always
pulled it together at 11:30.

1655
01:08:24.433 --> 01:08:26.143
[Lorne]
Yeah.

1656
01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:27.269
[Tanner]
The Kate Jackson show.

1657
01:08:27.311 --> 01:08:30.231
[Lorne]  Yes.
Here's the story. okay?

1658
01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:32.483
John is the fucking center
of the show.

1659
01:08:32.525 --> 01:08:33.859
It's about
Fred Silverman.

1660
01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:35.111
and he's playing
Fred Silverman.

1661
01:08:35.152 --> 01:08:37.446
[Charlie]  You all remember
Freddy Silverman?

1662
01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:40.032
[Lorne]  He'd been out with.
like. Ronnie Wood. you know?

1663
01:08:40.074 --> 01:08:43.119
And he was a mess.
And he was coughing. you know.

1664
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.538
He looked terrible.
and the doctor says.

1665
01:08:45.579 --> 01:08:46.622
"John can't go on."

1666
01:08:46.664 --> 01:08:49.667
And I was just
somewhere between rage

1667
01:08:49.708 --> 01:08:52.253
and very little sympathy.

1668
01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:55.631
And I said. "Well.
what happens if he does it?"

1669
01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:58.592
He said. "Well. he could die."

1670
01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:02.471
And I said.
"What are the odds of that?"

1671
01:09:02.513 --> 01:09:05.182
And he said. "50/50."

1672
01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:08.602
And I said.
"I can live with those odds."

1673
01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:10.813
John looked at me.
he opened his eyes.

1674
01:09:10.855 --> 01:09:13.524
and he did the show.

1675
01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:14.859
And he was bad.

1676
01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:17.987
dissonant dramatic music

1677
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:26.871
I think he did everything
he could to hang on that year.

1678
01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:30.416
but John didn't know how to do
anything except full throttle.

1679
01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:32.960
So being a movie star meant.
in his brain.

1680
01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:36.213
that he had to turn
his back on this other thing.

1681
01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:39.133
[cheers and applause]

1682
01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.926
I think
he never reconciled it.

1683
01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:43.929
and he got deeper and deeper
into the unhappiness

1684
01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:46.098
that comes with living

1685
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:50.936
for what everybody else says
is the ideal life. you know?

1686
01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:53.898
[cheers and applause]

1687
01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:57.651
blues music

1688
01:09:59.945 --> 01:10:01.071
[crew member] Mark.

1689
01:10:01.113 --> 01:10:03.532
- [emcee]  John Belushi!
- [cheers and applause]

1690
01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:05.201
- [host]  How are ya?
- [John]  I'm fine.

1691
01:10:05.242 --> 01:10:06.535
[host]  You're up doing
the movie today?

1692
01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:08.370
[John]  Oh. yeah.
We're doing  Blues Brothers.

1693
01:10:08.412 --> 01:10:10.414
- [Aykroyd]  Yeah.
- [cheers and applause]

1694
01:10:10.456 --> 01:10:13.250
Well. me and the Lord...

1695
01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:15.294
we got an understanding.

1696
01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:17.546
We're on a mission from God.

1697
01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:21.091
Sometimes I wonder

1698
01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:24.678
[Sean]  Danny and John
called me. and they said.

1699
01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.222
"I think there's a movie."

1700
01:10:26.263 --> 01:10:29.058
And it told the saga
of these brothers--

1701
01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:30.976
how Jake had been in prison.

1702
01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:32.895
how Elwood had to wait
for him.

1703
01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:34.980
how they had
to save the orphanage.

1704
01:10:35.022 --> 01:10:39.068
All against the backdrop
of their hometown of Chicago.

1705
01:10:39.109 --> 01:10:41.487
[Landis]  It was very important
that it be Chicago.

1706
01:10:41.528 --> 01:10:45.157
I mean. John. he was like--
he was a god in Chicago.

1707
01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:48.535
[emcee]  Ladies and gentlemen.
"Joliet" Jake Blues.

1708
01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:53.290
- John Belushi!
- [cheers and applause]

1709
01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:56.543
[Carrie]
John was just this big event.

1710
01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:59.838
Once you have that kind
of television fame.

1711
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.632
you belong to people.

1712
01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:05.511
You live in their homes.
in their TV sets.

1713
01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:09.431
Everyone felt they knew him
and could just come up to him

1714
01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:13.811
and give him drugs
or do whatever

1715
01:11:13.852 --> 01:11:15.688
because he was their friend.

1716
01:11:15.729 --> 01:11:17.606
[Shalit]  Okay. let's go.
Thank you very much.

1717
01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:19.692
Does it disturb you
to be an idol?

1718
01:11:19.733 --> 01:11:20.943
[John]
Yeah.

1719
01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:22.403
[Gene]  Does it disturb you
that so many people know you

1720
01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:23.779
and grab you
and recognize you?

1721
01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:25.072
[John]  Yeah. yeah.
you feel like a freak.

1722
01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.740
[host]  Is your family
theatrical at all?

1723
01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.158
Not at all. no.

1724
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.036
- What'd your father do?
- He was a hit man.

1725
01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:33.289
These are all personal
questions I'm not gonna answer.

1726
01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:36.542
We can talk about television.
We can talk about movies.

1727
01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:38.085
Want to talk about something
like that. okay?

1728
01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:39.586
My personal life
really doesn't mean anything.

1729
01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:41.964
- You don't want to do that?
- No. I don't.

1730
01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:43.340
[camera shutters clicking]

1731
01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:45.676
[Carrie]
He enjoyed it for a while.

1732
01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:49.138
and then I think he felt
more haunted by it.

1733
01:11:49.179 --> 01:11:51.682
[Mitch]  I know
there was a period where

1734
01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.017
it got really frenetic.

1735
01:11:53.058 --> 01:11:56.812
and so they opened a Blues Bar
in Chicago.

1736
01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:58.856
[Aykroyd]  I was up late
with him and partying

1737
01:11:58.897 --> 01:12:03.027
up at Chicago Blues Bar
virtually every night.

1738
01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:04.778
You know.
we're having a lot of fun.

1739
01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.697
24 hours. 365.

1740
01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:08.991
going out and immersing
ourselves in the music

1741
01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:10.242
and going to Maxwell Street

1742
01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:13.162
and really living what we were
making the movie about.

1743
01:12:13.203 --> 01:12:15.706
We owned the town.
We owned the city of Chicago.

1744
01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:18.417
You know. we used to hail
police cars on the way home.

1745
01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:22.504
And to own a city and have
a partner to share it with.

1746
01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:25.966
that was just. you know.
the peak of life.

1747
01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.343
[crew member]
Roll camera!

1748
01:12:27.384 --> 01:12:30.262
blues music

1749
01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:36.018
[Aykroyd]  One night.
nobody could find John.

1750
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.271
Someone said. "Well. I saw him
walking over across the street

1751
01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.315
and went into that
neighborhood over there."

1752
01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.817
I went to a house.
knocked on the door.

1753
01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:46.278
and a guy came to the door.
and he said.

1754
01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.365
"Oh. yes. Mr. Belushi--
he's in on the couch.

1755
01:12:49.406 --> 01:12:51.700
He's asleep."

1756
01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:53.994
Turned out John
had walked off the set.

1757
01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:56.205
gone to somebody's house.
knocked on the door. said.

1758
01:12:56.246 --> 01:12:57.664
"You know who I am.
John Belushi.

1759
01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:59.708
I'm tired.
I'm hungry."

1760
01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.085
He walked
into the guy's fridge.

1761
01:13:01.126 --> 01:13:03.712
made himself a sandwich.
had a glass of milk.

1762
01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:06.924
and then said. "Can I crash
out on your couch?"

1763
01:13:06.965 --> 01:13:08.258
Perfect stranger.

1764
01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.887
Answers. cast.
ready for rehearsal. please.

1765
01:13:11.929 --> 01:13:13.097
[Carrie]
Danny was the one

1766
01:13:13.138 --> 01:13:14.932
that used to call him
"America's guest."

1767
01:13:14.973 --> 01:13:17.601
because he could
go to anybody's house

1768
01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:21.063
and sleep in their beds
and eat their food

1769
01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:22.481
and watch their TV.

1770
01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:26.276
and there was no stopping John
doing anything.

1771
01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:29.530
Somehow. he got it
into his head

1772
01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:30.989
that I should date Danny.

1773
01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:34.576
So then Danny and I started
meeting in parking lots

1774
01:13:34.618 --> 01:13:36.453
and making out.

1775
01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:41.041
And it was
John's favorite thing ever.

1776
01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:42.751
The arrangement was

1777
01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:46.463
John and I were the bad kids.

1778
01:13:46.505 --> 01:13:49.675
and Danny and Judy

1779
01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:51.552
were the police.

1780
01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.643
[Mrs. Murphy]
Help you boys?

1781
01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:02.479
- You got any. uh. white bread?
- Yes.

1782
01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:06.150
[Elwood] I'll have some
toasted white bread. please.

1783
01:14:07.317 --> 01:14:10.028
[Mrs. Murphy] You want butter
or jam on that toast. honey?

1784
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.156
No. ma'am.
Dry.

1785
01:14:13.198 --> 01:14:14.283
Got any fried chicken?

1786
01:14:14.324 --> 01:14:17.536
Best damn chicken in the state.

1787
01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:20.247
[Jake] Bring me
four fried chickens and a Coke.

1788
01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.666
You want chicken wings
or chicken legs?

1789
01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:25.461
Four fried chickens and a Coke.

1790
01:14:25.502 --> 01:14:27.629
And some dry
white toast. please.

1791
01:14:27.671 --> 01:14:29.715
Y'all want anything
to drink with that?

1792
01:14:29.756 --> 01:14:31.216
- No. ma'am.
- A Coke.

1793
01:14:31.258 --> 01:14:33.594
Be up in a minute.

1794
01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.345
We got two honkies out there

1795
01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:37.890
dressed like
Hasidic diamond merchants.

1796
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:38.974
Say what?

1797
01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:41.518
They look like they're
from the CIA or something.

1798
01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.103
What they want to eat?

1799
01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:46.482
The tall one wants white bread.

1800
01:14:46.523 --> 01:14:48.609
toast. dry. with nothing on it.

1801
01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.693
Elwood.

1802
01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:52.946
And the other one wants
four whole fried chickens

1803
01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:53.947
and a Coke.

1804
01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:57.409
And Jake!
Shit. the Blues Brothers!

1805
01:14:57.451 --> 01:14:58.911
[Landis]
On  The Blues Brothers.

1806
01:14:58.952 --> 01:15:00.746
John was different.
and it was hard.

1807
01:15:00.787 --> 01:15:03.665
But you know that whole thing
about America's guest?

1808
01:15:03.707 --> 01:15:05.125
Well. it's true.

1809
01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:07.169
He could be abrupt
and unpleasant.

1810
01:15:07.211 --> 01:15:10.464
but most of the time
he was totally charming.

1811
01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.466
and people adored him.

1812
01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:13.800
Having said all this--

1813
01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.802
and I don't want to make it
sound worse than it was.

1814
01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:18.722
because I don't think we lost
four or five days shooting

1815
01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:21.558
at the most because of drugs.
which is a lot--

1816
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.977
but there's a couple of times
on the movie

1817
01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:26.730
when I was really worried
about his health.

1818
01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:28.190
And you can see it. you know?

1819
01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:29.775
There's some scenes
where he's there

1820
01:15:29.816 --> 01:15:31.276
and some scenes
where he's not.

1821
01:15:31.318 --> 01:15:33.529
It's 106 miles to Chicago.

1822
01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:36.698
We got a full tank of gas.
half a pack of cigarettes.

1823
01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:39.576
it's dark.
and we're wearing sunglasses.

1824
01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:40.452
Hit it.

1825
01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:44.373
rock music

1826
01:15:49.169 --> 01:15:52.005
[Carrie]  Traveling
at the high speeds he did.

1827
01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:54.049
he was just really
way out of control.

1828
01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:56.552
And the more they tried
to control him.

1829
01:15:56.593 --> 01:15:58.595
the more insane it got.

1830
01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.098
Hey!

1831
01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:04.518
Hey!

1832
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:08.146
Hey!

1833
01:16:08.188 --> 01:16:10.857
[wailing sirens fade]

1834
01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:13.569
[Aykroyd]  It was clear
to everyone at that point

1835
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:17.573
that John had a problem
with cocaine.

1836
01:16:17.614 --> 01:16:19.992
[Carrie]  There was
a point where everyone said.

1837
01:16:20.033 --> 01:16:23.245
you know.
"He's really killing himself."

1838
01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:26.123
And then when he didn't. then.
you thought.

1839
01:16:26.164 --> 01:16:30.711
"Well. maybe John's right.
Maybe he is invincible."

1840
01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:33.422
[Laila]  John would be okay
for a while.

1841
01:16:33.463 --> 01:16:35.424
and then he would go
on a bender.

1842
01:16:35.465 --> 01:16:39.303
and he would feel so guilty
and so tormented by it.

1843
01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:40.887
It was just terrible.

1844
01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:44.141
He just felt like he'd let
everybody down. you know?

1845
01:16:44.182 --> 01:16:46.727
And in those days.
people thought it was. like.

1846
01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:49.313
a question of self-will
or whatever. and it isn't.

1847
01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:53.609
It's a disease and has
nothing to do with willpower.

1848
01:16:53.650 --> 01:16:55.986
But we didn't understand that.

1849
01:16:56.028 --> 01:16:57.404
[Mitch]
It started to slip

1850
01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.281
into something
that was hurting him.

1851
01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:00.782
'cause he used to come over

1852
01:17:00.824 --> 01:17:02.326
and sleep
on my couch sometimes.

1853
01:17:02.367 --> 01:17:04.161
And it would keep me up
all night

1854
01:17:04.202 --> 01:17:06.121
because his sleeping
was so wet.

1855
01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:08.373
the sound in his chest
was so heavy

1856
01:17:08.415 --> 01:17:12.210
that I was worried
that he wasn't gonna wake up.

1857
01:17:12.252 --> 01:17:14.379
Now. you know. I had. like.
a few nights of it.

1858
01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:15.922
scattered. you know.
when he'd be at the house.

1859
01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:17.966
but that's how Judy lived.

1860
01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:19.259
You could leave as a friend.

1861
01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.303
You could just go
do your life.

1862
01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:23.513
but that was her life.

1863
01:17:23.555 --> 01:17:26.808
[wind blowing]

1864
01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:48.705
[Judy]  John's drug abuse
was disturbing to everyone.

1865
01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:56.672
We had some conversations
about rehab.

1866
01:17:56.713 --> 01:17:59.716
but he didn't like that idea.

1867
01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:03.345
I know I spoke. myself. to
some doctors who had told me.

1868
01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:07.015
"Wait till he's passed out
and then call."

1869
01:18:07.057 --> 01:18:10.519
and they would make the
arrangements and commit him.

1870
01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.022
But I just--
I couldn't do that.

1871
01:18:15.774 --> 01:18:19.695
And that was when Nana had
a heart attack at the ranch.

1872
01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:21.655
And John was not being
cooperative.

1873
01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.532
He didn't want to go.

1874
01:18:23.573 --> 01:18:26.326
He said.
"I know what she's doing.

1875
01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:30.080
She's waiting for me to come
so she can die."

1876
01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:33.125
I said. "Why don't
you give her that." you know?

1877
01:18:33.166 --> 01:18:36.962
"Why don't you let her
have that. John?"

1878
01:18:37.003 --> 01:18:38.922
So we went.

1879
01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:41.675
He was making the nurses
laugh and he made Nana laugh

1880
01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:44.386
and he was kind of pretending
to scold her

1881
01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:45.846
for making everybody worry.

1882
01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:49.391
And then he put his head down
on her pillow

1883
01:18:49.433 --> 01:18:51.351
and fell asleep.

1884
01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:52.978
She said. "Johnny tired.
Go home.

1885
01:18:53.019 --> 01:18:54.271
Go sleep.
Sleep late."

1886
01:18:54.312 --> 01:18:56.398
I remember something about
"don't get up early"

1887
01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.108
or something.

1888
01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.486
The next morning.
the call was that she died.

1889
01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:04.656
and he just broke down.

1890
01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.493
I think that's when
he began to realize

1891
01:19:08.535 --> 01:19:11.413
that he'd crossed
into really dangerous behavior

1892
01:19:11.455 --> 01:19:14.875
and needed to find a way out.

1893
01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:17.169
And bringing in Smokey
was something he thought

1894
01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:20.005
was gonna help.

1895
01:19:20.046 --> 01:19:22.799
[Aykroyd]
Let's talk about Smokey.

1896
01:19:22.841 --> 01:19:24.885
Smokey was Richard Nixon's

1897
01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:27.679
primary Secret Service
bodyguard

1898
01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:29.389
from the time Nixon went
to China

1899
01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:32.058
through the end
of his presidency.

1900
01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:35.687
So Smokey
was eminently qualified

1901
01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.773
to handle difficult problems.

1902
01:19:37.814 --> 01:19:42.027
and he kept the scum balls
and the sleazebags

1903
01:19:42.068 --> 01:19:44.613
away from John.

1904
01:19:44.654 --> 01:19:47.157
Between Judy. myself.
and Smokey.

1905
01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:50.744
we were able. really.
to keep John straight.

1906
01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.245
and. of course. you know.

1907
01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:54.956
it didn't seem that John
wanted to help himself.

1908
01:19:54.998 --> 01:19:57.000
really. until that point.

1909
01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:59.002
rock music

1910
01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.004
[Shalit]  Is there life after
Saturday Night.

1911
01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:03.924
after  Animal House.
after  The Blues Brothers?

1912
01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:07.052
John Belushi.
you have a new movie called

1913
01:20:07.093 --> 01:20:08.637
- Continental Divide.
- [John]  Right.

1914
01:20:08.678 --> 01:20:10.555
[Shalit]  It is. to me. a
turning point in your career.

1915
01:20:10.597 --> 01:20:12.974
Hey. man.
I seen this one before.

1916
01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:15.519
- You're what's-his-name.
- That's right.

1917
01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.479
The character's different
than the other characters

1918
01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:18.647
I've played in the past.

1919
01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:20.482
This character can read
and write.

1920
01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:22.359
- [chuckles]
- [John]  I play a reporter.

1921
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.487
They send me out to do
an interview with this woman.

1922
01:20:25.529 --> 01:20:27.113
[Shalit]  Now. this film
is a risk for you.

1923
01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:29.908
because your fans are gonna go
expecting to see  Animal House.

1924
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:31.409
[John]  Yeah.
they'd love to have me do

1925
01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:33.620
Animal House Goes To Camp.
Animal House Joins the Army.

1926
01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:37.499
Animal House Rides
the Space Shuttle.  you know?

1927
01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:39.668
But that's not the way I work.

1928
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:41.169
[Shalit laughs]

1929
01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:46.258
[Michael]  he had it in him
to be a terrific actor

1930
01:20:46.299 --> 01:20:48.844
rather than just a comedian.

1931
01:20:48.885 --> 01:20:51.721
and he really worked hard
at it.

1932
01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:53.431
He lost 40 pounds.

1933
01:20:53.473 --> 01:20:55.642
You know. he was working out
all the time.

1934
01:20:57.435 --> 01:21:00.146
He was very focused
about his life and his work.

1935
01:21:00.188 --> 01:21:02.941
This was. I think.
a good time for him.

1936
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:09.114
[Shalit]  People say you work
under such a frenetic pace.

1937
01:21:09.155 --> 01:21:11.116
Do you see the world
different now?

1938
01:21:11.157 --> 01:21:13.243
Are you a little bored?
Do you take time off?

1939
01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:14.619
Do you lounge around now?

1940
01:21:14.661 --> 01:21:16.538
I'm enjoying life
a little more.

1941
01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:19.207
I'm finding out what to do
with my spare time.

1942
01:21:19.249 --> 01:21:20.959
[Shalit]
Find out who you are yet?

1943
01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:22.335
Yeah. yeah. I think so.

1944
01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:23.670
[Shalit] Who are you?
Are you Bluto?

1945
01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.047
Are you Mike Royko?
Who are you?

1946
01:21:26.089 --> 01:21:28.425
I don't know.
I'm just an actor.

1947
01:21:28.466 --> 01:21:31.803
Yeah. honey. something
special just for you

1948
01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:32.721
Yeah.

1949
01:21:32.762 --> 01:21:36.057
[cheers and applause]

1950
01:21:36.766 --> 01:21:38.727
[Judy]
Times were good.

1951
01:21:38.768 --> 01:21:40.520
We were staying
at Martha's Vineyard

1952
01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.731
because we bought a new house.

1953
01:21:42.772 --> 01:21:44.024
He'd begun to. you know.

1954
01:21:44.065 --> 01:21:45.650
kind of calm down.
settle down.

1955
01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:48.445
not be as interested
in the whole social scene.

1956
01:21:48.486 --> 01:21:51.990
John. where are you?

1957
01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:53.783
[John]
Over here.

1958
01:21:53.825 --> 01:21:54.701
You up there?

1959
01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:57.287
[Judy] Yes.
What are you doing?

1960
01:21:57.329 --> 01:22:01.166
Well. I'm preparing
the barbecue tonight.

1961
01:22:01.207 --> 01:22:02.125
[Judy]
That's good.

1962
01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:04.377
We're having steak
and sausage.

1963
01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:06.254
And you see.
I cleaned the grill.

1964
01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:08.757
Big Bill Broonzy's
"Trouble in Mind"

1965
01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:10.842
Get out of my kitchen.
Get out.

1966
01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:13.595
- [John] Mmm.
- [Judy] Mmm.

1967
01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.639
No. no. no. no!

1968
01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:19.893
[John] Judy. we're going out
to the beach now.

1969
01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:21.645
[Judy whistles]

1970
01:22:21.686 --> 01:22:23.396
And if the blues
overtake me

1971
01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:25.440
Gonna rock right away
from here

1972
01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:28.234
[Aykroyd]  It was a summer
of just sun-filled days.

1973
01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.361
soaking in the sea.

1974
01:22:29.402 --> 01:22:30.862
Every day. we swam.

1975
01:22:30.904 --> 01:22:34.699
The whole summer
was basically clean.

1976
01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:39.037
There was no coke at all
for the entire summer.

1977
01:22:39.079 --> 01:22:40.956
[John]
I'm going out for croquet.

1978
01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:46.002
- [John] Yes. sir.
- Yes. sir.

1979
01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:48.088
I don't care if I die

1980
01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.547
[Siskel]
You're a big movie star.

1981
01:22:49.589 --> 01:22:50.715
Your pictures make money.

1982
01:22:50.757 --> 01:22:53.802
Are you as happy as you seem
to me to be right now?

1983
01:22:53.843 --> 01:22:55.679
Yeah.
This year. yeah.

1984
01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.519
[cheers and applause]

1985
01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.853
[Judy]
John was. you know.

1986
01:23:03.895 --> 01:23:05.772
feeling pretty good
about himself.

1987
01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:08.274
We had Smokey with us.

1988
01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:10.652
and he saw John doing well

1989
01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:14.864
and decided
that it was time to go.

1990
01:23:14.906 --> 01:23:17.742
And I remember Smokey went
to him. "No. you're good.

1991
01:23:17.784 --> 01:23:20.328
You don't need me.
You'll be fine."

1992
01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:25.709
And when he left.
John was concerned.

1993
01:23:31.047 --> 01:23:34.342
[Carrie]  We were up
in Martha's Vineyard.

1994
01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.596
And I just remember him
stripped to the waist

1995
01:23:38.638 --> 01:23:40.640
with this belly out.

1996
01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:42.600
and he was sort of howling
at the moon

1997
01:23:42.642 --> 01:23:45.103
and saying.
"You and I are alike.

1998
01:23:45.145 --> 01:23:48.106
We're addicts!"

1999
01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:50.316
[Tanner]  He was mostly clean
for over a year.

2000
01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:54.946
[Carrie]  Well. that must've
been a screaming hell for him.

2001
01:23:56.489 --> 01:24:00.285
Drugs aren't the problem.
Sobriety is the problem.

2002
01:24:00.326 --> 01:24:02.328
Because he had
no support group

2003
01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:07.000
to sort of tell him how
to deal with what comes up

2004
01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.710
when you stop doing drugs.

2005
01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:11.546
You're not doings drugs
for no reason.

2006
01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:16.092
And so once your management
medication is removed.

2007
01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:19.846
all those feelings that
it's been sitting on come up.

2008
01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:23.516
and you have
no coping skills.

2009
01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:25.894
[waves crashing]

2010
01:24:25.935 --> 01:24:30.273
So you can't trust yourself.

2011
01:24:36.696 --> 01:24:38.698
[feedback whining]

2012
01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:42.118
[guitar chords reverberate]

2013
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.455
[indistinct chatter]

2014
01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:47.957
[Mitch]
You know.

2015
01:24:47.999 --> 01:24:50.210
John gave me all his blues
albums at one point.

2016
01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:52.921
and it was really a drag
because he just said.

2017
01:24:52.962 --> 01:24:55.715
"Yeah. I don't listen
to this shit anymore.

2018
01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:56.883
Fuck this.

2019
01:24:56.925 --> 01:24:58.426
I'm just gonna listen to Fear
and the Dead Kennedys."

2020
01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:00.011
- [Tanner]  Yeah.
- [Mitch]  Punk and stuff.

2021
01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:01.805
Yeah.
I mean. I hated that shit.

2022
01:25:01.846 --> 01:25:04.057
[punk rock music playing]

2023
01:25:04.099 --> 01:25:07.435
But when you look at it.
in retrospect. it coincided

2024
01:25:07.477 --> 01:25:11.898
with a particularly chaotic
and dark thing in him.

2025
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:14.859
I don't need anyone

2026
01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:17.529
Don't need no mom and dad

2027
01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:19.489
Don't need no pretty face

2028
01:25:19.531 --> 01:25:20.949
[Harold]
You know. for John. you know.

2029
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:23.326
it's a classic
addictive pattern. you know?

2030
01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:24.828
It's what makes
an addict an addict.

2031
01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:28.540
is the expectation that if you
just get more of your drug

2032
01:25:28.581 --> 01:25:29.749
that you will. you know.

2033
01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.960
finally cross over
some threshold

2034
01:25:32.001 --> 01:25:34.796
or find
some permanent satisfaction.

2035
01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:37.924
but you can't get high enough.
you can't get famous enough.

2036
01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:39.259
you can't get rich enough

2037
01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.345
to kind of fill
those great holes. you know.

2038
01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:44.222
he had created himself.

2039
01:25:46.599 --> 01:25:50.687
[Carrie]  John didn't have
a limit on anything.

2040
01:25:50.728 --> 01:25:52.105
Usually people have in them

2041
01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:53.898
a thing where you go.
"Ooh-ooh.

2042
01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:55.358
That's too much."

2043
01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.736
But John didn't have
whatever that is.

2044
01:25:58.778 --> 01:26:00.613
John took heroin.

2045
01:26:04.909 --> 01:26:07.579

What do you say. neighbor?

2051
01:26:21.384 --> 01:26:24.971
Welcome to the end of the road.
I guess. [chuckles]

2052
01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:27.182
[Harold]
As big a star as he was.

2053
01:26:27.223 --> 01:26:29.934
I think John was groping
for a film image.

2054
01:26:29.976 --> 01:26:32.979
He called me at one point
and he said.

2055
01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.856
"Yeah. I'd love for you
to read a screenplay.

2056
01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:36.399
I'm thinking
about directing it."

2057
01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:38.443
And I said. you know.
"Send it over.

2058
01:26:38.484 --> 01:26:39.986
and I'll get to it
when I can."

2059
01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.071
"Well. no. you kind of have
to read it now."

2060
01:26:42.113 --> 01:26:45.783
I said. "Well. what is it?"
He said. "It's  Neighbors."

2061
01:26:45.825 --> 01:26:48.244
"But aren't you already
shooting that movie?

2062
01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:49.954
You know.
you have a director."

2064
01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:54.584
[Judy]  Dan and John
were very excited

2065
01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:57.712
and started to work
with Avildsen. the director.

2066
01:26:57.754 --> 01:27:02.425
And immediately John was
really worried that the film.

2067
01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:05.470
rather than being the black
comedy that the book was.

2068
01:27:05.511 --> 01:27:08.389
it was taking on
a much more cartoony

2069
01:27:08.431 --> 01:27:10.433
and silly perspective.

2070
01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:14.646
And true to form.
he was fighting that.

2071
01:27:14.687 --> 01:27:17.398
[Aykroyd]  John Avildsen
did not present himself

2072
01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.234
as a strong presence.

2073
01:27:19.275 --> 01:27:21.903
and John perceived weakness
right there.

2074
01:27:21.945 --> 01:27:24.405
It was like
the Battle of the Bulge.

2075
01:27:24.447 --> 01:27:25.990
The Allied lines were weak.

2076
01:27:26.032 --> 01:27:29.869
and the panzers rolled
right into the weak spot.

2077
01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:32.247
[Judy]  John felt isolated
and frustrated.

2078
01:27:32.288 --> 01:27:35.458
and that's when everything
fell apart.

2079
01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.335
[Tanner]
Now. on the  Neighbors  set.

2080
01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:39.379
- Smokey was not there.
- [Aykroyd]  Yeah.

2081
01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.005
And when we got to nights.

2082
01:27:41.047 --> 01:27:42.882
the drugs
became available again.

2083
01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:44.217
[painting clatters]

2084
01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:47.804
[Zanuck]  I never sensed that
there was anything going on

2085
01:27:47.845 --> 01:27:51.933
until we actually started
that week of night shooting.

2086
01:27:51.975 --> 01:27:54.811
slowly building
punk rock

2087
01:27:54.852 --> 01:27:57.438
It was pretty horrifying.
quite frankly.

2088
01:27:58.648 --> 01:28:02.568
And I liked John.
but it wasn't John.

2089
01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:05.446
He wouldn't come
out of his trailer.

2090
01:28:05.488 --> 01:28:10.368
We'd go in. and the music
would be blasting away.

2091
01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:12.829
I won't believe that
this is all

2092
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:16.249
He'd be in his undershorts
and was totally out of it.

2093
01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:18.501
No more. no more. no more

2094
01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:21.045
No more. no more.
no more. no

2095
01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:24.340
[Zanuck]  One time. we had two
guys standing behind him

2096
01:28:24.382 --> 01:28:26.884
holding him up off camera.
you know?

2097
01:28:26.926 --> 01:28:30.513
I mean. that's the kind
of shape he was in.

2098
01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:33.141
He couldn't control it.

2099
01:28:33.182 --> 01:28:35.893
and then no one
could control him.

We

2103
01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:23.191
Were strangers

2104
01:29:26.402 --> 01:29:30.031
We

2105
01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:36.537
[Mitch]  John's choices had
always been America's choices.

2106
01:29:36.579 --> 01:29:38.998
What he wanted to do
was kind of resonating

2107
01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.792
with the country
that way. and...

2108
01:29:40.833 --> 01:29:43.211
the choices
weren't doing that anymore.

2109
01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:48.383
But John could've failed.
and Hollywood--

2110
01:29:48.424 --> 01:29:50.051
he could've done ten movies
in a row.

2111
01:29:50.093 --> 01:29:52.720
and they still would've wanted
him for the 11th.

2112
01:29:52.762 --> 01:29:54.889
You know.
there was nobody like him.

2113
01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:59.185
But the thing with cocaine
is that it puts you

2114
01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:00.645
in a vulnerable place.

2115
01:30:00.686 --> 01:30:03.606
His strength and confidence
and positive way

2116
01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:06.234
were being eroded
by all of it. and...

2117
01:30:06.275 --> 01:30:08.152
he just allowed it
to affect him.

2118
01:30:08.194 --> 01:30:11.489
And in the old days.
nothing could affect him.

2119
01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:13.449
[Shalit]  What do you want to be
doing ten years from now.

2120
01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:14.909
John Belushi?

2121
01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:16.661
- Fiddler on the Roof.
- [Shalit] Okay.

2122
01:30:16.702 --> 01:30:18.871
And. Dan Aykroyd.
ten years from now?

2123
01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:21.082
- Directing him in  Fiddler.
- [laughs]

2124
01:30:21.124 --> 01:30:23.459
I don't know. I don't know.
I'll work with this guy.

2125
01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:26.170
I'll be working with this guy
in ten years.

solemn music

2127
01:30:39.183 --> 01:30:42.103
[Judy]  He always promised that
he would try to do better

2128
01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:44.856
and that I had to trust
that he loved me

2129
01:30:44.897 --> 01:30:47.024
and that. even when things
were difficult.

2130
01:30:47.066 --> 01:30:48.860
that I could count on him.

2131
01:30:50.903 --> 01:30:53.698
But every time John went
into that spin cycle.

2132
01:30:53.739 --> 01:30:57.243
it would immediately put me
back into a feeling of panic.

2133
01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.661
of. like. "Oh. no."

2134
01:30:58.703 --> 01:31:01.497
[chuckles]
"I thought this was over."

2135
01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:05.209
I had begun to see
a psychiatrist.

2136
01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:08.379
And what my doctor immediately
said is. you know.

2137
01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:11.591
"You have to focus on yourself
and work on yourself."

2138
01:31:13.843 --> 01:31:17.805
It just sort of brought home
how things move so quickly.

2139
01:31:17.847 --> 01:31:20.683
and there was so much to do
all the time.

2140
01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:22.977
Helping him get
the things done he needed.

2141
01:31:23.019 --> 01:31:26.272
I didn't think
about myself. really.

2142
01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.316
[typewriter clacking]

2143
01:31:28.357 --> 01:31:29.734
John was supposed to go to LA

2144
01:31:29.775 --> 01:31:33.279
to start working on a script
with Don Novello.  Noble Rot.

2145
01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:35.031
And normally
I would've gone with him.

2146
01:31:35.072 --> 01:31:36.824
but my psychiatrist
asked me to commit

2147
01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:40.036
to staying in the city
for three months at least

2148
01:31:40.077 --> 01:31:41.537
to work with him.

2149
01:31:43.247 --> 01:31:45.958
And I told him that it was
really hard for me not to go.

2150
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.586
that John needed me.
and he said.

2151
01:31:48.628 --> 01:31:50.546
"Well.
what are you afraid of?"

John and I got together

2154
01:32:17.573 --> 01:32:19.617
when I had moved out
to Los Angeles.

2155
01:32:19.659 --> 01:32:21.869
and he would just kind of sit
down and have dinner with us.

2156
01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:24.664
and he wanted to get the band
together and play again.

2157
01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:26.666
That was his really big thing.

01:32:29.627 --> 01:32:31.796
And he said.
"Who can you get?"

2160
01:32:31.837 --> 01:32:33.297
And I said.
"Well. Tony's out here.

2161
01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:35.341
We'll get Tony to play guitar.
I'll play bass.

2162
01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:36.509
You'll be on drums."

2163
01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:39.554
And we actually did a job.
believe it or not.

2164
01:32:39.595 --> 01:32:42.265
We played the wrap party
for  Taxi.

He was reaching out
for everybody

2169

and trying to reconnect.

2170
01:32:55.444 --> 01:32:57.989
It was something
that we never spoke of

2171
01:32:58.030 --> 01:33:00.241
other than the fact
that we all kind of enjoyed

2172
01:33:00.283 --> 01:33:04.120
that we were all back in each

and a couple of other guys
from Wheaton together

2176
01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:20.386
and played this wrap party.

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:22.179
- [Tanner]  Yeah.
- [Mitch]  And it was really

2178
01:33:22.221 --> 01:33:24.098
this grasp for nostalgia.

2179
01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:26.851

So I hardly ever saw him.

2181
01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:39.822
but I saw him at a party.

01:33:39.864 --> 01:33:41.866
He looked exhausted.

2183
01:33:41.907 --> 01:33:44.452
And he laid his head
on my shoulder.

2184
01:33:44.493 --> 01:33:47.288
and all he said was.
"Oh. Harold.

2185
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:49.081
Oh. Harold."

2186
01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:53.210
Just couldn't even articulate
anything about his situation.

I just sensed
this total despair.

[Mitch]  Judy had basically
given him an ultimatum.

2189
01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:02.511
That's why she wasn't with him
in California.

2190
01:34:02.553 --> 01:34:05.473
Judy was drawing a line
in the sand to save him

2191
01:34:05.514 --> 01:34:08.184
so they could be together.
but. you know. he was.

2192
01:34:08.225 --> 01:34:11.604
at that point. afraid
that he had lost Judy.

You know. and for all
their codependence.

2194

01:34:26.535 --> 01:34:27.912
I didn't hear from him
for a while.

2198
01:34:27.953 --> 01:34:29.580
You know. a couple days
I was wondering.

2199
01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:32.917
And then he just said.
"They don't like the script."

2200
01:34:32.958 --> 01:34:34.585
They said. though.
we can do it.

2201
01:34:34.627 --> 01:34:38.297
but I have to do this other
movie first.  Joy of Sex.

2202
01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:40.800
and they want me
to wear a diaper.

2203
01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:42.218
How's that. man?

2204
01:34:42.259 --> 01:34:43.386
[Mitch]
The  Joy of Sex

2205
01:34:43.427 --> 01:34:44.887
was basically
sort of a garbage script

2206
01:34:44.929 --> 01:34:46.389
that they were dusting
off the heap that.

2207
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:47.848
if they put John's name on it.

2208
01:34:47.890 --> 01:34:50.184
they could guarantee
a big opening weekend.

2209
01:34:50.226 --> 01:34:52.520
[Don]
They just wanted John Belushi.

2210
01:34:52.561 --> 01:34:54.355
and they want him
to wear a diaper.

2211
01:34:54.397 --> 01:34:57.066
They don't give a shit
about him.

2212
01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:59.860
This is the thing where John
had no one on his side.

2213
01:34:59.902 --> 01:35:02.071
I'm the guy. you know.
that wrote this with him.

2214
01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:04.782
I'm up in Toronto.
His wife's on the East Coast.

2215
01:35:04.824 --> 01:35:05.950
He's got nobody there.

2216
01:35:05.991 --> 01:35:08.869
So that's his state of mind.
He's got no one.

2217
01:35:08.911 --> 01:35:11.205
You know. he's alone.

2218
01:35:11.247 --> 01:35:13.249
Man.

2219
01:35:17.128 --> 01:35:19.463
[Tanner]  Did you sense
that things were that bad

2220
01:35:19.505 --> 01:35:21.549
in terms of the drug use
during that last week?

2221
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:23.843
[Tino]
No. he was keeping it from me.

2222
01:35:23.884 --> 01:35:25.720
He definitely kept it from me.

2223
01:35:25.761 --> 01:35:28.431
You know. everybody knew
about cocaine.

2224
01:35:28.472 --> 01:35:32.059
I mean. a lot of people were
doing cocaine in those days.

2225
01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:33.519
But the heroin?
Never.

2226
01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.439
Never thought of it.
never for a minute.

2227
01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:42.153
[Aykroyd]
Last time I heard his voice.

2228
01:35:42.194 --> 01:35:43.654
it was
on the answering machine.

2229
01:35:43.696 --> 01:35:47.158
and it was very slurred. and.
you know. he was fucked up.

2230
01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:48.284
and he was hurting.

2231
01:35:48.325 --> 01:35:50.077
And I called
and talked him down.

2232
01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:52.371
and. you know.
he was sad and defeated.

2233
01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:54.165
He was sad and defeated.
and when I said.

2234
01:35:54.206 --> 01:35:57.501
"John. come on. man.
you gotta get home.

2235
01:35:57.543 --> 01:35:58.711
You gotta get home.

2236
01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:00.963
You gotta leave Hollywood
alone for a while.

2237
01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:02.339
Let's approach it
from another angle.

2238
01:36:02.381 --> 01:36:04.008
I'm writing
something great here for us

2239
01:36:04.049 --> 01:36:06.093
that's gonna solve
everything."

2240
01:36:06.135 --> 01:36:08.804
I was writing  Ghostbusters.

2241
01:36:08.846 --> 01:36:11.932
So he said. "Okay."

2242
01:36:11.974 --> 01:36:15.936
It's just that
his sensitive side caved in

2243
01:36:15.978 --> 01:36:19.648
and he was numbing the pain
and fighting it off.

2244
01:36:19.690 --> 01:36:23.736
It seemed like. you know.
could never get out of that.

2245
01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:26.781
And I thought. you know.
"I better finish this page.

2246
01:36:26.822 --> 01:36:30.451
this paragraph.
and get the fuck out there."

2247
01:36:30.493 --> 01:36:32.119
But I didn't get
to him in time.

2248
01:36:32.161 --> 01:36:36.123
Of course. you know.
I carry that with me forever.

2249
01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:46.509
[cheers and applause]

2250
01:36:49.553 --> 01:36:51.597
[Elwood]
My brother. Jake.

2251
01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.849
would like to become....

2252
01:36:53.891 --> 01:36:56.811
increasingly intimate
with you.

2253
01:36:56.852 --> 01:36:58.562
[cheers and applause]

2254
01:36:58.604 --> 01:37:02.316
And he feels that
he can unwind a little bit.

2255
01:37:02.358 --> 01:37:05.236
sing a song
about his personal life.

2256
01:37:05.277 --> 01:37:07.279
Here's my brother. Jake.

2257
01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:08.614
Thank you.

2258
01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:11.242
[cheers and applause]

2259
01:37:11.283 --> 01:37:14.495
The Blues Brothers'
"Guilty"

2260
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:23.504
[John as Jake]
Yeah. baby

2261
01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:28.092
Yeah. I been drinking

2262
01:37:30.302 --> 01:37:32.721
And I

2263
01:37:32.763 --> 01:37:36.308
I shouldn't come by. no

2264
01:37:40.062 --> 01:37:44.692
But I found myself
in trouble. darling

2265
01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:52.116
And I had nowhere else
to go

2266
01:37:54.451 --> 01:37:57.121
Got some whiskey

2267
01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.334
From the barman

2268
01:38:05.087 --> 01:38:07.464
I got some cocaine

2269
01:38:07.506 --> 01:38:10.009
[cheers and applause]

2270
01:38:10.050 --> 01:38:12.553
From my friends

2271
01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:20.144
I gotta
keep on moving. baby

2272
01:38:22.938 --> 01:38:27.151
Till I'm back
in your arms again

2273
01:38:30.988 --> 01:38:32.740
Guilty

2274
01:38:34.909 --> 01:38:37.161
Yes. I'm guilty

2275
01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:42.416
And I'll be guilty

2276
01:38:42.458 --> 01:38:47.630
For the rest of my life

2277
01:38:48.714 --> 01:38:50.049
How come. baby

2278
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:52.301
How come I never do

2279
01:38:54.678 --> 01:38:57.389
What I'm supposed to do?

2280
01:38:59.516 --> 01:39:03.479
How come everything I try

2281
01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.399
Never turns out right?

2282
01:39:10.569 --> 01:39:13.614
You know
how it is with me. baby

2283
01:39:20.412 --> 01:39:24.416
You know
I just can't stand myself

2284
01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:34.134
It takes a whole lot
of medicine. darling

2285
01:39:34.176 --> 01:39:36.887
For me to pretend

2286
01:39:36.929 --> 01:39:40.808
That I'm somebody else

2287
01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:49.525
[cheers and applause]

2288
01:39:50.567 --> 01:39:53.112
[Aykroyd]  Got the call.
and so I immediately got up

2289
01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:55.322
and began to really motor.

2290
01:39:55.364 --> 01:39:56.991
It was a beautiful March day.

2291
01:39:57.032 --> 01:39:59.827
It was a blue sky and sun
and everything.

2292
01:39:59.868 --> 01:40:01.578
and I remember
on the way down there

2293
01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:03.163
and as I just got
close to the village.

2294
01:40:03.205 --> 01:40:05.457
it was already
on the newsstand right there--

2295
01:40:05.499 --> 01:40:08.210
you know.
"Belushi dead at 33."

2296
01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:10.504
somber music

2297
01:40:10.546 --> 01:40:13.632
[Judy]  I heard someone.
you know. opening the door.

2298
01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:16.343
and Danny yelled out
for me. and I--

2299
01:40:16.385 --> 01:40:19.054
his voice. you know. was off.

2300
01:40:19.096 --> 01:40:21.598
And I knew
something was wrong.

2301
01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:24.435
And I said. you know.
"Is he okay?

2302
01:40:24.476 --> 01:40:26.228
Was there an accident?"

2303
01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:29.565
And he said.
in the most gentle voice...

2304
01:40:30.482 --> 01:40:32.651
"No. honey. he's dead."

2305
01:40:35.654 --> 01:40:37.614
[Aykroyd]  You know.
the pain didn't come out

2306
01:40:37.656 --> 01:40:39.867
for me. really.
until after the funeral.

2307
01:40:39.908 --> 01:40:41.785
at my house
in Martha's Vineyard.

2308
01:40:41.827 --> 01:40:43.954
And everybody was gone.

2309
01:40:43.996 --> 01:40:46.081
and the snow started to fall--

2310
01:40:46.123 --> 01:40:47.624
beautiful white snow.
you know.

2311
01:40:47.666 --> 01:40:51.086
and I got down on my knees.
and I wept.

2312
01:40:55.591 --> 01:40:58.052
[Judy]
I always believed that...

2313
01:40:58.093 --> 01:40:59.845
his true self
would shine through

2314
01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:03.724
and that he wouldn't
ultimately be destroyed

2315
01:41:03.766 --> 01:41:05.559
by drugs.

2316
01:41:05.601 --> 01:41:08.854
But I've spent a lot of time
thinking about it all.

2317
01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:11.065
and I have worked
through those things.

2318
01:41:11.106 --> 01:41:12.858
I don't. you know...

2319
01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:15.569
I don't blame myself...

2320
01:41:15.611 --> 01:41:16.737
anymore.

2321
01:41:18.489 --> 01:41:21.492
And the whole experience.
my whole life with John.

2322
01:41:21.533 --> 01:41:25.621
to meet so young
and have so many adventures

2323
01:41:25.662 --> 01:41:28.707
and the love that we shared...

2324
01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:31.043
I wouldn't trade.

2325
01:41:32.544 --> 01:41:35.631
- [host]  A final question.
- [John]  Yeah.

2326
01:41:35.672 --> 01:41:39.176
[host]  I would like to know
how you do what you do.

2327
01:41:39.218 --> 01:41:40.302
[John]
What are you asking me?

2328
01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:41.470
[host]
Let's take the cartwheel.

2329
01:41:41.512 --> 01:41:43.055
That catches everybody
by surprise.

2330
01:41:43.097 --> 01:41:45.766
[John]  Oh. I've been doing that
since sixth grade.

2331
01:41:45.808 --> 01:41:47.518
Everything you do
in your life.

2332
01:41:47.559 --> 01:41:48.936
everything that I've ever done
in my life.

2333
01:41:48.977 --> 01:41:51.188
I've used on camera
somewhere.

2334
01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:52.731
[Aykroyd]
You can't ask him this.

2335
01:41:52.773 --> 01:41:54.024
This is why he's a star.

2336
01:41:54.066 --> 01:41:55.359
This is why he's John Belushi.

2337
01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.236
is because
he does these things.

2338
01:41:57.277 --> 01:41:59.863
- and it's his special energy.
- [John]  Yeah.

2339
01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:02.074
[Aykroyd]  You know.
he'll expire on this planet

2340
01:42:02.116 --> 01:42:04.868
and have left his mark
because nobody can learn

2341
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:09.331
how to do what Belushi does.
and no one ever will. man.

2342
01:42:09.373 --> 01:42:11.083
[film reel clicking]

2343
01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:13.669
[clicking stops]

2344
01:42:15.546 --> 01:42:18.757
"With a Little
Help from My Friends"

2345
01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:38.068
[indistinct chatter]

2346
01:42:38.902 --> 01:42:40.863
What would you do

2347
01:42:40.904 --> 01:42:45.117
- If I sang out of tune?
- [cheers and applause]

2348
01:42:45.159 --> 01:42:48.620
Would you stand up
and walk out on me?

2349
01:42:49.746 --> 01:42:51.957
Lend me your ear

2350
01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:55.919
And I'll.
I'll sing you a song

2351
01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:58.881
Oh. I will try not to sing
out of key

2352
01:42:58.922 --> 01:43:02.926
Oh. baby. I get high
with a little help

2353
01:43:02.968 --> 01:43:04.136
From my friends

2354
01:43:04.178 --> 01:43:06.972
Well. don't you know.
I'm gonna get high

2355
01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:09.057
With a little help
from my friends

2356
01:43:09.099 --> 01:43:11.935
Oh. don't you know
I'm gonna get my friends

2357
01:43:11.977 --> 01:43:14.980
High with a little help
from my friends

2358
01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:16.982
Oh. oh. oh. oh

2359
01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:18.358
Oh. yeah

2360
01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:22.738
Whoo. ooh. ooh

2361
01:43:22.779 --> 01:43:24.907
What do I do

2362
01:43:24.948 --> 01:43:27.618
When my love is away?

2363
01:43:27.659 --> 01:43:31.622
Does it worry you
to be alone?

2364
01:43:31.663 --> 01:43:33.790
Oh. no

2365
01:43:33.832 --> 01:43:38.545
How do I feel
at the end of the day?

2366
01:43:38.587 --> 01:43:42.633
Are you sad because you're
on your own?

2367
01:43:42.674 --> 01:43:44.176
Oh. man. I

2368
01:43:44.218 --> 01:43:49.181
High with a little help
from my friends

2369
01:43:49.223 --> 01:43:53.936
Whoo. ooh. ooh

2370
01:43:57.231 --> 01:44:00.359
The Ventures'
"The 2000 Pound Bee. Part 2"

2371
01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:03.487
up-tempo rock music

2372
01:45:35.579 --> 01:45:36.955
mellow acoustic music

2373
01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:39.207
[Judy]   Well.
I'm a fast-talking

2374
01:45:39.249 --> 01:45:43.420
Fast-walking Midwest kid

2375
01:45:43.462 --> 01:45:45.422
Never thought I'd grow up

2376
01:45:45.464 --> 01:45:48.675
But I'm glad I finally did

2377
01:45:48.717 --> 01:45:50.635
I done good in school

2378
01:45:50.677 --> 01:45:54.264
I learned to be cool.
and it served me well

2379
01:45:54.306 --> 01:45:57.142
I married a rebel.
I fought with the devil

2380
01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:59.394
And I lived to tell

2381
01:46:01.104 --> 01:46:03.315
These are the best days

2382
01:46:03.357 --> 01:46:06.234
These are the best days
of my life

2383
01:46:06.276 --> 01:46:08.528
These are the best days

2384
01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:11.823
These are the best days
of my life

2385
01:46:13.241 --> 01:46:16.828
There was a time I thought
I'd be a virgin all my life

2386
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:19.790
I never thought
I would make a wife

2387
01:46:19.831 --> 01:46:22.584
When it came round
to adultery

2388
01:46:22.626 --> 01:46:25.128
Never thought
that I was sultry

2389
01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:27.964
But you know
the best one. kiddo

2390
01:46:28.006 --> 01:46:30.133
Never thought
I'd be a young widow

2391
01:46:30.175 --> 01:46:32.469
You cut the debt.
you get what you get

2392
01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:36.264
You play your best game.
and you never forget that

2393
01:46:36.306 --> 01:46:38.767
These are the best days

2394
01:46:38.809 --> 01:46:41.895
These are the best days
of my life

2395
01:46:41.937 --> 01:46:44.189
These are the best days

2396
01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:47.442
These are the best days
of my life

2397
01:46:49.403 --> 01:46:51.488
Hello. blue eyes

2398
01:46:51.530 --> 01:46:53.698
You are my best surprise

2399
01:46:53.740 --> 01:46:56.535
Now you and your sisters

2400
01:46:56.576 --> 01:46:58.578
Stand by my side

2401
01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:01.706
Times may get rough.
we get tougher

2402
01:47:01.748 --> 01:47:04.376
We're not the kind to sit
and suffer

2403
01:47:04.418 --> 01:47:07.003
I got your backs.
and that's the facts

2404
01:47:07.045 --> 01:47:10.507
Because I am
your motherfucking mother

2405
01:47:10.549 --> 01:47:13.218
These are the best days

2406
01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:15.971
These are the best days
of my life

2407
01:47:16.012 --> 01:47:18.598
These are the best days

2408
01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:21.893
These are the best days
of my life

2409
01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:27.774
I lost
my good friend today

2410
01:47:29.067 --> 01:47:32.696
We had so much more
to say now

2411
01:47:34.114 --> 01:47:35.699
All we shared

2412
01:47:37.868 --> 01:47:40.996
Is in the past

2413
01:47:41.037 --> 01:47:44.249
These are the best days

2414
01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:47.544
These are the best days
of my life

2415
01:47:47.586 --> 01:47:50.422
These are the best days

2416
01:47:50.464 --> 01:47:53.425
These are the best days
of my life

2417
01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:56.178
These are. these are

2418
01:47:56.219 --> 01:47:57.512
These are the best days

2419
01:47:57.554 --> 01:48:00.307
Oh. these. these are.
these are

2420
01:48:00.348 --> 01:48:04.478
These. these are
the best days

2421
01:48:04.519 --> 01:48:07.522
Of my life

2422
01:48:10.442 --> 01:48:11.651
[Judy] Ha ha. that's it.
