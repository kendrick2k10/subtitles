Are they for us?

00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:41.455
No one said we can.

18
00:04:41.498 --> 00:04:43.761
No one said we can't.
though. right?

May I have one?

22
00:05:14.618 --> 00:05:15.924
Thank you.

23
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:24.454
Oh. that's lovely. Mm.

24
00:05:24.498 --> 00:05:27.588
It's a particularly good one.
Mm.

25
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:30.242
Come on. everyone.
Come and get one.

[chuckles]

28
00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:03.580
My name is Roald Dahl.

29
00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:05.539
Now. some of you
may be wondering

30
00:06:05.582 --> 00:06:08.629
why there was a bowl
with peaches in it.

31
00:06:08.672 --> 00:06:10.021
Well. that's because

32
00:06:10.065 --> 00:06:13.068
I've written a book
about a peach.

33
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:15.157
A magical one.

34
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.335
And what I'm going to do today
is read you some of it.

35
00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.034
- Hey. what about this stone?
- Oh. Uh...

36
00:06:23.078 --> 00:06:28.082
Well... do you think you can
get it in the bowl from there?

37
00:06:28.126 --> 00:06:30.651
- Easy.
- Is it?

38
00:06:30.694 --> 00:06:33.393
Yes. Well. I tell you what...

39
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:37.788
How about backwards. hmm?

00:06:40.748 --> 00:06:43.054

Augustus.

44
00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:18.481
Dad.

45
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:22.616
Caught the tail end.
Very amusing.

46
00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:24.400
- Thank you.
- Pete Perkins.

47
00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.576
- What is?
- Ah. that's my name.

48
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.361
Is that so? Good for you.

49
00:07:29.405 --> 00:07:31.712
Consider myself a bit of
a wordsmith. actually.

50
00:07:31.755 --> 00:07:33.235
A few poems here and there.

51
00:07:33.278 --> 00:07:35.759
The odd colorful
limerick at university.

52
00:07:35.803 --> 00:07:37.848
That sort of thing.

53
00:07:37.892 --> 00:07:40.068
I definitely think
I've got a book or two in me.

54
00:07:41.678 --> 00:07:44.464
Not a children's book.
of course.

55
00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:45.900
Something a bit-- bit weightier.

56
00:07:45.943 --> 00:07:47.467
- Weightier?
- Mm.

57
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.338
Well done for
"Johnny And The Giant..."

58
00:07:49.381 --> 00:07:51.340
- Pineapple.
- Ah. thank you. yes.

59
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.736
"Johnny And The Giant
Pineapple." [laughs]

60
00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.609
We've all got to start
somewhere. haven't we?

61
00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:01.045
I did originally
think peach. but--

62
00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:02.960
No. No. no. no.

63
00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:04.919
Kids can relate to a pineapple.

64
00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:06.877
Pineapple's the one.

65
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:08.966
I shall give you my card.

66
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.751
If things pick up for you.

67
00:08:10.794 --> 00:08:14.015
you might need
a decent solicitor.

68
00:08:14.058 --> 00:08:15.843
I'm much more
than just a lawyer. you know.

69
00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:18.236
Dog with a bone.
that's what I am.

70
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.761
And that's exactly
what someone like you needs.

71
00:08:20.804 --> 00:08:23.633
If I was your dog. with a bone.

72
00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:27.289
I would be 120 percent
committed to...

73
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.163
I say. Isn't that...

74
00:08:32.207 --> 00:08:34.296
"Klaatu barada nikto."

75
00:08:34.338 --> 00:08:35.645
- Patricia Neal.
- Who?

76
00:08:35.688 --> 00:08:37.952
Oh. come on.
Patricia Neal. Huge.

77
00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:39.866
Great big American movie star.

78
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.738
- How did she get here?
- What. transport-wise?

79
00:08:41.782 --> 00:08:44.393
No. no. what's she doing here
at this sorry little affair

80
00:08:44.436 --> 00:08:46.134
in the middle of nowhere?

81
00:08:46.177 --> 00:08:47.875
Probably the wrong address.
You know actresses.

82
00:08:47.918 --> 00:08:51.400
None too bright
but nice to look at.

83
00:08:51.443 --> 00:08:53.402
- Rather.
- Well. she's nothing special.

84
00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:56.797
The sort of girl I'd soon have
wrapped round my finger.

85
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.451
- In your dreams. old chap.
- Oh. really?

86
00:08:59.495 --> 00:09:02.846
I don't know if you're a
betting man. Mr. Perkins.

87
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:08.199
but ten bob says that I leave
with Patricia Neal tonight.

88
00:09:08.243 --> 00:09:11.768
Okay. I'll take your money.

89
00:09:11.812 --> 00:09:13.640
Gus can be banker.

90
00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:21.996
Ms. Neal. allow me
to introduce myself.

91
00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:23.606
I'm Roald Dahl.

92
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.695
- The Roald Dahl?
- One and the same.

93
00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:28.350
And this is my good friend.
Jerry Jenkins.

94
00:09:28.393 --> 00:09:30.613
Well. it's lovely
to meet you. Mr. Jenkins.

95
00:09:30.657 --> 00:09:32.746
Perkins. actually.
Pete Perkins.

96
00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:34.356
I'm sorry. I knew it was
something along those lines.

97
00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:36.097
And this is Gus.
Augustus. really.

98
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.838
But he prefers Gus.
Don't you. Gus?

99
00:09:37.881 --> 00:09:41.102
- Pleasure to meet you. Gus.
- Wow.

100
00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:43.626
Funny thing. Patricia. if I may.

101
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.454
Pete here's just bet me
ten shillings

102
00:09:45.497 --> 00:09:47.717
that I don't leave with you
tonight.

103
00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:52.200
Leave with me. as in...

104
00:09:52.243 --> 00:09:54.550
Well. Mr. Jenkins. really.

105
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:55.899
- It wasn't my...
- Oh. come now.

106
00:09:55.943 --> 00:09:57.335
Didn't you just say
that actresses are

107
00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:00.382
none too bright
but nice to look at?

108
00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:02.906
- No. you just said that...
- So. how about it. Pat?

109
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.517
I've a nice little place
the other side of Amersham.

110
00:10:05.561 --> 00:10:08.608
Well. Mr. Dahl.
I'm flattered by your offer.

111
00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:11.959
but well. I'm not sure
my husband would approve.

112
00:10:12.002 --> 00:10:14.831
Oh. You're married.
What a shame.

113
00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:18.008
Although I have to say. I am a
bit of a sucker for a tall man.

114
00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:19.314
Well. that's a bit of luck.

115
00:10:19.357 --> 00:10:20.750
Any other qualities
you look for?

116
00:10:20.794 --> 00:10:24.058
Well. let me think. now...

117
00:10:24.101 --> 00:10:27.365
There is one thing
I can't resist.

118
00:10:27.409 --> 00:10:30.064
That's a man who cooks
a good breakfast.

119
00:10:30.107 --> 00:10:33.415
Well. Ms. Neal. I have to tell
you that back in Great Missenden

120
00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:35.286
they call me
the King of Breakfasts.

121
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.682
- Oh. do they. now?
- Hey. What about your husband?

122
00:10:39.726 --> 00:10:42.424
[whispers]
I won't tell him if you don't.

123
00:10:42.467 --> 00:10:44.078
So good to have met you. Gus.

124
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:46.036
- No. no. All yours.
- Mr. Jenkins.

125
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.472
Jerry.

126
00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:56.003
You. Mr. Dahl.
are one big kid.

127
00:10:56.046 --> 00:10:57.657
Is that so?

128
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.008
And the day you stop
is the day I file for divorce.

129
00:11:04.794 --> 00:11:07.231
[instrumental music]

130
00:11:11.366 --> 00:11:15.196
Roald: We had two daughters.
The first we called Olivia.

131
00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:17.372
Olivia Twenty Dahl.

132
00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:19.417
Olivia from Twelfth Night.

133
00:11:19.461 --> 00:11:21.855
Twenty because that's all
the money I had in my pocket

134
00:11:21.898 --> 00:11:24.684
on the bright sunny day
she was born.

135
00:11:24.727 --> 00:11:28.557
Olivia. Our little zookeeper.

136
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.516
Then there was
Chantal Sophia Dahl.

137
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.040
Sophia after my mother.

138
00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:36.478
But we realized
she'd be Chantal Dahl.

139
00:11:36.521 --> 00:11:38.828
So she became Tessa.

140
00:11:38.872 --> 00:11:41.396
Tessa who always agreed
the best approach

141
00:11:41.439 --> 00:11:43.485
was to do things her own way.

142
00:11:43.528 --> 00:11:45.530
including sleeping
anywhere she could.

143
00:11:45.574 --> 00:11:48.751
so long as
it wasn't in her bed.

144
00:11:48.795 --> 00:11:51.145
And Theo.
the boy who we nearly lost

145
00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:52.712
in a traffic accident

146
00:11:52.755 --> 00:11:55.627
on a wet winter road
in New York City.

147
00:11:57.455 --> 00:12:00.763
Then. of course. Pat.
star of stage and screen.

148
00:12:00.807 --> 00:12:03.853
Now trying to keep her career
and her family afloat

149
00:12:03.897 --> 00:12:07.161
in a rickety old tub
we called Gipsy House.

150
00:12:08.336 --> 00:12:10.251
[instrumental music]

151
00:12:12.253 --> 00:12:14.385
And then we come in to land.

152
00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:17.780
[dog barks]

153
00:12:24.874 --> 00:12:27.094
Gabriel's wing's better now.

154
00:12:27.137 --> 00:12:29.357
It is. isn't it?

155
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.403
He's not Gabriel.
He's Uriel.

156
00:12:32.447 --> 00:12:34.405
Do you call them
all after angels?

157
00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:36.146
They are all angels.

158
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.193
Angels that shit everywhere.
that's for sure.

159
00:12:39.236 --> 00:12:40.498
Come on.

160
00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:42.979
[instrumental music]

161
00:12:43.023 --> 00:12:44.633
Roald: And his name
is Charlie Rocket.

162
00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:46.983
Olivia: Daddy. I love that
you call him that.

163
00:12:47.027 --> 00:12:49.333
Roald: He lives in a little
house with his mother and father

164
00:12:49.377 --> 00:12:50.900
and his father's
mother and father

165
00:12:50.944 --> 00:12:52.641
and his mother's
mother and father.

166
00:12:52.684 --> 00:12:55.383
Olivia: All in one house?
Roald: All in one bed.

167
00:12:55.426 --> 00:12:59.430
They're very poor. you see.
Poor and all called Bob.

168
00:12:59.474 --> 00:13:01.128
- All called Bob?
- Yes.

169
00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:02.912
Both grandmothers
are called Roberta.

170
00:13:02.956 --> 00:13:06.916
Then there's Grandpa Robert
and other Grandpa Robert.

171
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.442
- [chuckles] That's funny.
- I don't know. It might work.

172
00:13:11.486 --> 00:13:15.142
- What sweets do they make?
- Oh. incredible ones.

173
00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:16.970
Fudge?
Can there be fudge?

174
00:13:17.013 --> 00:13:18.972
Oh. yes. there'll be
a whole lake of it.

175
00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:20.843
And gobstoppers?

176
00:13:20.887 --> 00:13:22.627
Oh. yes. they're your favorite.
aren't they?

177
00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:25.456
Yeah. but they never
last long enough.

178
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.980
These ones will.

179
00:13:27.023 --> 00:13:29.809
In fact.
these will last forever.

No.

Prince Peeperpeepoo.

187
00:13:47.696 --> 00:13:50.525
No. Probably not that either.

I don't know
why you like it so much.

192
00:14:19.249 --> 00:14:21.338
It's a shivery smile.

The other thing
that our man likes

is to make fountains
out of sugar.

it gets a bit sticky.

They won't be too much longer.
darling.

200
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:58.680
Go find something
and play until they get back.

201

But I've played everything.

202

Well. you can't have
played everything.

203
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.816
I have. Really.

204
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.470

what mommy said

about having to work?

only to disturb you

if it was an emergency.

208
00:15:12.172 --> 00:15:14.000
- That's right.
- Like now.

209
00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:20.093
And what is the emergency?

they go mi-mi-mi-mi-mi...

We're looking for pixies.

Pixies?
In Buckinghamshire?

Fat chance. No. you only get
pixies in Cornwall.

- Fairies! We've got fairies.
- Well. yes. that's right.

But the trouble with fairies.
you see.

226
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.185
is-- is they're terribly shy.

227
00:16:09.229 --> 00:16:10.882
and so it's quite hard
to see them.

00:16:10.926 --> 00:16:14.930
Yes. Unless it's the third
of November. of course.

King Appleflapple will like it?

Oppletopple? Of course he will.
It's magnificent.

Can we see him on his rabbit?

Well. as long as
it's not past bath time.

Oh. dear. Which it is.

But. daddy. you said we
could if we made a tribble.

- Tribute.
- So can we?

We'll have to see
in the morning. Mm?

00:17:28.656 --> 00:17:31.137
This isn't one of
your stories. is it?

255
00:17:35.228 --> 00:17:36.577
You'll see.

00:17:46.108 --> 00:17:48.067
Come on. I'm gonna get you!

You want them to fly away.
do you. Livvy?

263
00:18:09.175 --> 00:18:10.480
They'd come back.

264

Well. I admire your optimism.

265
00:18:12.221 --> 00:18:14.354
They will. It's their home.

- Don't.

Got the right sort of
earthiness to her. I suppose.

And I don't?

00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:41.990
They're just used to seeing you

in a fox fur
drinking a martini.

275
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.125
What does that mean?
It's all I'm good for?

276

- That's not what I'm saying.
- It doesn't matter.

I've. I've still got that
crappy airport thing.

278
00:18:51.434 --> 00:18:54.089
Well. like I said. don't do it
if you don't want to.

279
00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:58.137
That is ripe coming from
the man whose last advance

280
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.356
wouldn't even cover a
case of that Scotch

fond of downing.

pay a hell of a lot more

What's that supposed to mean?

that comes out of your head.

would he?

No. because Cooper
wouldn't leave his wife.

Was that. was that an apology?

And then about 2 o'clock
in the morning. you see.

340
00:23:57.392 --> 00:23:59.699
the owls arrive every day.

341

- Owls?
- Yes.

What would you know?

I know owls eat slugs.

made by owls.

00:45:28.334 --> 00:45:30.728
[indistinct chatter]

534
00:45:35.907 --> 00:45:38.344
[panting]

535
00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:50.922
You fix things. Roald.

536
00:45:50.965 --> 00:45:53.533
That's what you do.

537
00:45:53.576 --> 00:45:56.536
Now. when.
when Theo had his accident.

538
00:45:56.579 --> 00:46:01.062
you buzzed around
until you fixed it.

539
00:46:01.106 --> 00:46:03.412
And I loved you for it.
I did.

540
00:46:05.327 --> 00:46:08.983
But I can't.
I can't do it anymore.

541
00:46:12.117 --> 00:46:15.294
You have to fix it. Roald.
You have to fix it.

542
00:46:16.512 --> 00:46:19.733
Before it's so broken

543
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.953
that it can't be fixed anymore.

544
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:39.144
[instrumental music]

545
00:46:48.153 --> 00:46:49.676
[thunder rumbling]

546
00:46:51.983 --> 00:46:54.333
[instrumental music]

547
00:47:03.603 --> 00:47:06.388
[instrumental music]

548
00:47:33.502 --> 00:47:36.418
[music continues]

549
00:47:47.734 --> 00:47:49.170
It's crazy to think your

550
00:47:49.214 --> 00:47:51.869
old headmaster crowned
the Queen of England.

551
00:47:51.912 --> 00:47:53.131
Married her too.

552
00:47:54.567 --> 00:47:57.483
- Good to see you again. boss.
-Hm.

553
00:47:58.788 --> 00:48:00.921
[sighing]

554
00:48:00.965 --> 00:48:03.054
Spark's gone out of you.
hasn't it. Dahl?

555
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:08.494
Completely understandable
in the circumstances.

556
00:48:08.537 --> 00:48:11.584
And you must be Mrs. Dahl.

557
00:48:11.627 --> 00:48:15.240
- My sincerest condolences.
- Thank you.

558
00:48:15.283 --> 00:48:17.764
Please call me Pat. Your Grace.

559
00:48:20.158 --> 00:48:21.899
I understand you're an actress.

560
00:48:21.942 --> 00:48:23.248
Yes. that's right.

561
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:26.512
My. my. Well. there you are.

562
00:48:30.298 --> 00:48:34.041
Thank you for taking this time
to see us.

563
00:48:34.085 --> 00:48:36.783
Not at all. Of course.

564
00:48:36.826 --> 00:48:39.438
Anything to help.

565
00:48:39.481 --> 00:48:42.006
This has been very difficult
for Pat. Uh...

566
00:48:43.964 --> 00:48:46.619
- Well. for both of us.
- Yes.

567
00:48:46.662 --> 00:48:50.492
But the fairer sex always

568
00:48:50.536 --> 00:48:53.234
feels the loss of a child
more deeply.

569
00:48:53.278 --> 00:48:55.019
Yes. Roald has been
weathering all of this

570
00:48:55.062 --> 00:48:56.846
so much better than I have.

571
00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:59.675
At least I haven't been asking
the postman for his opinion.

572
00:48:59.719 --> 00:49:01.416
You don't mind if I...

573
00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.635
Actually. I do.

574
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:16.954
So...

575
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:22.046
- Two daughters?
- Mm-hm. A-- and a son.

576
00:49:22.089 --> 00:49:24.570
Olivia. and Tessa and Theo.

577
00:49:26.354 --> 00:49:29.401
You can imagine how this has
left us all.

578
00:49:29.444 --> 00:49:32.143
Bereft.

579
00:49:32.186 --> 00:49:36.843
Yes. he can be a right old sod
at times. can't he?

580
00:49:36.886 --> 00:49:37.844
Who?

581
00:49:40.368 --> 00:49:42.501
- God.
- God?

582
00:49:44.633 --> 00:49:47.810
You. you told us that
once at school.

583
00:49:47.854 --> 00:49:50.422
Me? Absolutely not.

584
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:56.428
- I'm probably mistaken.
- Most definitely.

585
00:50:06.786 --> 00:50:09.006
Anyway...

586
00:50:09.049 --> 00:50:14.837
you must take comfort from the
fact that your little. um...

587
00:50:14.881 --> 00:50:18.450
- Olivia.
- Olivia. Yes. yes.

588
00:50:18.493 --> 00:50:24.325
Olivia is blissfully happy
in the kingdom of our Lord.

589
00:50:24.369 --> 00:50:28.895
The way I like to look at heaven
is to imagine

590
00:50:28.938 --> 00:50:31.376
where she was happiest on Earth

591
00:50:31.419 --> 00:50:35.989
and then multiply it
a thousandfold.

592
00:50:36.033 --> 00:50:37.469
Well. that's the garden.
isn't it? She was always

593
00:50:37.512 --> 00:50:39.340
happiest in the garden.
wasn't she. Roald?

594
00:50:39.384 --> 00:50:41.255
W-- with her animals.

595
00:50:41.299 --> 00:50:46.043
Then that's where she is now.
In God's garden.

596
00:50:46.086 --> 00:50:48.610
The most wonderful garden
imaginable.

597
00:50:48.654 --> 00:50:50.221
Without the animals. of course.

598
00:50:50.264 --> 00:50:54.355
- But beautiful. Full of ripe--
- I-- I'm-- I'm sorry.

599
00:50:54.399 --> 00:50:56.792
Excuse me. Wha-- what do you
mean without the animals?

600
00:50:56.836 --> 00:50:58.664
Not allowed.

601
00:50:58.707 --> 00:51:02.798
Animals have their own
afterlife.

602
00:51:02.842 --> 00:51:04.322
[chuckling]

603
00:51:04.365 --> 00:51:05.366
[Patricia clearing throat]

604
00:51:06.715 --> 00:51:08.282
You are joking?

605
00:51:08.326 --> 00:51:10.328
It's hardly a joking matter.

606
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:12.547
But then she wouldn't be happy.

607
00:51:12.591 --> 00:51:15.985
Sorry.
Not me who makes the rules.

608
00:51:16.029 --> 00:51:18.075
N-- no. not without Trilby. No.

609
00:51:18.118 --> 00:51:19.685
- Not without Rowley.
- No.

610
00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:23.080
The-- the rabbit and the dog.

611
00:51:25.212 --> 00:51:29.695
Definitely no dogs allowed.

612
00:51:33.046 --> 00:51:38.617
No. Rowley needs to be running
through the garden with her.

613
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:42.838
Both of them running
with the sun on their backs.

614
00:51:42.882 --> 00:51:45.928
So she's not so alone.

615
00:51:45.972 --> 00:51:48.888
- No.
- No dogs allowed?

616
00:51:48.931 --> 00:51:53.980
Christ! What sort of miserable
bloody God doesn't like dogs?

617
00:51:58.289 --> 00:52:02.336
Roald: Sorry. Forgot what a
pompous arse he was.

618
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.033
Patricia: No dogs in heaven.

619
00:52:04.077 --> 00:52:06.993
[both chuckling]

620
00:52:08.995 --> 00:52:11.911
[both laughing]

621
00:52:17.743 --> 00:52:21.225
Roald: [sobbing] Oh. Livvy.

622
00:52:21.268 --> 00:52:23.444
Livvy!

623
00:52:23.488 --> 00:52:24.445
Livvy!

624
00:52:26.839 --> 00:52:28.971
That's right.

625
00:52:29.015 --> 00:52:31.670
- That's right. Our Livvy.
- Oh. God.

626
00:52:31.713 --> 00:52:35.804
- Say it. Say it.
- Olivia!

627
00:52:35.848 --> 00:52:38.764
[dramatic music]

628
00:52:40.287 --> 00:52:41.810
Patricia: Thank you.

629
00:52:41.854 --> 00:52:42.811
[Roald sobbing]

630
00:52:44.204 --> 00:52:45.162
[clanking]

631
00:52:55.433 --> 00:52:57.783
Hello. Trilby. Hi. Trilby.

632
00:53:13.015 --> 00:53:13.973
Matilda.

633
00:53:15.714 --> 00:53:17.019
She's mine again?

634
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:19.979
She always was.

635
00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:28.335
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy's sorry?

636
00:53:28.379 --> 00:53:29.380
Yes.

637
00:53:31.033 --> 00:53:34.820
And sorry for shouting about
the birds too.

638
00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:39.128
Sorry a second time?

639
00:53:39.172 --> 00:53:41.522
Do you forgive me?

640
00:53:41.566 --> 00:53:45.744
Yes. And I'm sorry
a second time too.

641
00:53:45.787 --> 00:53:47.702
I wish I hadn't let them go.

642
00:53:51.315 --> 00:53:53.752
I was just thinking...

643
00:53:53.795 --> 00:53:57.103
perhaps we could
wander down to the village

644
00:53:57.146 --> 00:53:59.497
and buy some chocolate?

645
00:54:01.194 --> 00:54:02.456
Both together?

646
00:54:04.328 --> 00:54:05.285
If you'd like.

647
00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:10.986
Tessa: It's a silly name.

648
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:14.294
Roald: Well. no sillier than
Rock Hudson or Maurice Teapot.

649
00:54:14.338 --> 00:54:16.078
Tessa: No one's Maurice Teapot.

650
00:54:16.122 --> 00:54:17.645
Roald: Well. I'll have you know
that Maurice Teapot

651
00:54:17.689 --> 00:54:19.343
happens to be a very good
friend of mine.

652
00:54:19.386 --> 00:54:21.823
Sells carpets in Llandudno.

653
00:54:21.867 --> 00:54:24.913
Have you still got the owls
who make chocolate?

654
00:54:24.957 --> 00:54:26.785
Oh. yes. you didn't like them.
did you?

655
00:54:26.828 --> 00:54:28.613
No. They're too slimy.

656
00:54:28.656 --> 00:54:31.137
Well. it's just as well
that daddy's the writer. eh?

657
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.838
I can't unthink what I thinked.

658
00:54:36.882 --> 00:54:38.405
But you're a child.

659
00:54:38.449 --> 00:54:40.712
So isn't it a children's story.
then?

660
00:54:45.412 --> 00:54:46.935
[door opening]

661
00:54:46.979 --> 00:54:48.459
- Hello.
- Morning.

662
00:54:55.335 --> 00:54:56.902
Two gobstoppers. please.

663
00:54:57.685 --> 00:54:59.383
Woman 1: Right.

664
00:54:59.426 --> 00:55:00.819
One never lasts long enough.

665
00:55:04.779 --> 00:55:05.824
That's very true.

[music continues]

668
00:55:48.127 --> 00:55:49.694
Roald: What's that?

669
00:55:49.737 --> 00:55:51.652
It's just something Marty Ritt's
directing.

670
00:55:53.524 --> 00:55:55.308
Not thinking of doing it.
are you?

671
00:55:55.352 --> 00:55:56.744
Well. perhaps.

672
00:55:58.964 --> 00:56:00.357
Not too soon?

673
00:56:01.923 --> 00:56:04.099
Well. you're working.

674
00:56:04.143 --> 00:56:08.321
Me working doesn't mean
leaving the kids. does it?

675
00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:10.018
No. I suppose not.

676
00:56:11.759 --> 00:56:14.588
No. but look. if you really
think you're ready.

677
00:56:14.632 --> 00:56:15.981
then we'll deal with it.

678
00:56:18.113 --> 00:56:19.114
Like we always do.

[dog barking]

683
00:58:10.965 --> 00:58:12.489
You want me to read it now?

684
00:58:14.665 --> 00:58:18.059
[chuckling] Well. of course now.

685
00:58:54.574 --> 00:58:55.532
Darling.

686
00:58:59.013 --> 00:58:59.971
Do you like it?

687
00:59:00.754 --> 00:59:01.712
Like it?

688
00:59:03.061 --> 00:59:04.453
I love it.

689
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.677
I absolutely love it.

690
00:59:10.721 --> 00:59:13.724
- I was getting so nervous.
- It's brilliant.

691
00:59:13.767 --> 00:59:15.595
It's funny and-- and twisted.

692
00:59:15.639 --> 00:59:17.597
- Twisted?
- In-- in a good way.

693
00:59:17.641 --> 00:59:21.601
It's-- it's twisted and original
like only Roald Dahl can be.

694
00:59:21.645 --> 00:59:24.386
- You're not just saying that?
- No. no. no. Really.

695
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:26.258
It's-- it's really.
really wonderful.

696
00:59:26.301 --> 00:59:29.130
Well. good. A-- any notes.
how-- however small?

697
00:59:29.174 --> 00:59:30.610
Because I-- I want it
to be right.

698
00:59:30.654 --> 00:59:32.743
- Well...
- I know. I know. Too many kids.

699
00:59:32.786 --> 00:59:35.615
- I thought nine was too many...
- No. I think seven is perfect.

700
00:59:35.659 --> 00:59:37.748
No. well. i-- instinctively I--

701
00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:40.315
I-- I think that seven
is still too many.

702
00:59:40.359 --> 00:59:41.708
I think there should be fewer.

703
00:59:41.752 --> 00:59:42.927
but I just don't know
which one to lose.

704
00:59:42.970 --> 00:59:44.624
- Oh. perhaps...
- Go-- go on. say.

705
00:59:44.668 --> 00:59:46.800
I-- I won't take offence.
Because this one's got to sell.

706
00:59:46.844 --> 00:59:48.062
- Of course.
- I know what you're thinking.

707
00:59:48.106 --> 00:59:50.369
The bills are piling up
and-- and...

708
00:59:50.412 --> 00:59:52.371
Yeah. this can't be another
stinker like "Peach."

709
00:59:52.414 --> 00:59:54.503
W-- when did I say "Peach"
was a stinker?

710
00:59:54.547 --> 00:59:57.115
Well. not in so many words. but
sometimes it's what's not said

711
00:59:57.158 --> 00:59:58.725
that's more important.

712
00:59:58.769 --> 01:00:02.773
"Say. Roald. how many copies of
"Peach" did you sell?"

713
01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:04.775
Two thousand six-hundred
and thirty-three.

714
01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.039
Please don't do this
to yourself.

715
01:00:08.082 --> 01:00:11.129
Oh. God. what was I thinking?

716
01:00:11.172 --> 01:00:14.219
Roald. kids are gonna love this.

717
01:00:14.262 --> 01:00:15.829
Kids? What have kids got to
do with it?

718
01:00:15.873 --> 01:00:19.528
It's-- it's... it's not kids
who buy kids' books.

719
01:00:19.572 --> 01:00:23.271
It's-- it's adults. It's parents
buying for their children.

720
01:00:23.315 --> 01:00:24.969
And parents don't want twisted.

721
01:00:25.012 --> 01:00:27.275
Roald. you are getting yourself
in a state over nothing.

722
01:00:27.319 --> 01:00:28.929
Nothing? Oh. no. no...
No. you're right.

723
01:00:28.973 --> 01:00:30.496
This is-- this is nothing.
This is just a...

724
01:00:30.539 --> 01:00:32.672
just a bunch of
meaningless scribbles.

725
01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:35.327
Do you know what we do with a
bunch of scribbles? We do this.

726
01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:38.069
Stop it. Roald! No! No!

727
01:00:38.112 --> 01:00:39.766
Roald. stop it!

728
01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:42.464
No. Roald! Roald. stop it!

729
01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:43.640
- Stop it!
- I'm done.

730
01:00:46.817 --> 01:00:50.211
Christ! You are a...
you're like a petulant child!

731
01:00:50.255 --> 01:00:51.691
Didn't you say when I stopped
was the day

732
01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.911
you'd file for divorce?

733
01:00:53.954 --> 01:00:55.434
Don't tempt me!

734
01:01:00.308 --> 01:01:03.224
[engine whirring]

735
01:01:11.537 --> 01:01:12.494
[door closing]

736
01:01:25.551 --> 01:01:27.596
Oh! [gasps]

737
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.425
[laughing] My God. Marty!

738
01:01:30.469 --> 01:01:31.600
- What are you...
- Finding you.

739
01:01:31.644 --> 01:01:33.385
[laughing]

740
01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:35.126
So this is where you ended up.
huh?

741
01:01:35.169 --> 01:01:37.432
Oh. Marty. what on earth are you
doing here?

742
01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:39.217
- Just passing.
- Through Buckinghamshire?

743
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.001
Oh. so that's where I am.

744
01:01:41.045 --> 01:01:44.701
[laughing] Come on. sit down.
I'll make you a cup of tea.

745
01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:48.705
Roald around?

746
01:01:49.793 --> 01:01:52.360
Ah... somewhere.

747
01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:55.755
I can't begin to imagine what...

748
01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:57.670
what you two have been through.

749
01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:59.106
- Don't.
- Of course.

750
01:02:05.504 --> 01:02:07.898
Anyway. I hear you like
the script.

751
01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:09.726
Oh. I do. I love it.

752
01:02:09.769 --> 01:02:11.815
It's one of the best things
I've ever read.

753
01:02:11.858 --> 01:02:13.251
Thought you might say that.

754
01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:16.297
So who do you think
should play Alma?

755
01:02:16.341 --> 01:02:18.517
There's Shirley MacLaine.

756
01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.780
Not got the mileage.

757
01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:23.914
- Bancroft?
- Bancroft as a housekeeper.

758
01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:26.351
- You kidding me?
- Shelley would be good.

759
01:02:26.394 --> 01:02:28.179
She might not have
the right sex appeal.

760
01:02:28.222 --> 01:02:29.180
[chuckling] Marty.

761
01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:33.575
I. I-- I am flattered. I am.

762
01:02:33.619 --> 01:02:36.361
Tell me you don't know
how to play Alma.

763
01:02:36.404 --> 01:02:37.971
Of course I know how to
play Alma.

764
01:02:38.015 --> 01:02:39.886
Tell me you don't wanna
play Alma.

765
01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:43.760
Come on. Pat.

766
01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:47.154
You're the only one
I can see doing it. And Paul.

767
01:02:47.198 --> 01:02:48.852
You're the only one
he can see too.

768
01:02:48.895 --> 01:02:53.508
And you know what these big shot
Hollywood stars are like.

769
01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:54.945
Seriously?

770
01:02:54.988 --> 01:02:57.425
Pat. I'm sitting at your
kitchen table

771
01:02:57.469 --> 01:03:00.080
in the middle of
Buckinghamshire.

772
01:03:00.124 --> 01:03:01.516
How much more serious
do you want me to get?

773
01:03:03.214 --> 01:03:04.824
[sighing] I don't know.

774
01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:07.131
You know. we-- we're.
we're getting there. but...

775
01:03:07.174 --> 01:03:09.046
But what?

776
01:03:09.089 --> 01:03:10.525
Well. there's the kids.
for a start.

777
01:03:10.569 --> 01:03:13.659
Bring them with you.
I know a great nanny.

778
01:03:13.702 --> 01:03:16.096
Well. that's a lie.
But the studio will help...

779
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.837
Marty! Marty! Marty!

780
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:19.621
If only it were a few months
down the line.

781
01:03:19.665 --> 01:03:22.842
You didn't tell me
we had a visitor.

782
01:03:22.886 --> 01:03:26.454
Roald. you remember Marty?

783
01:03:26.498 --> 01:03:28.108
In the neighborhood.
were you. Marty?

784
01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:35.986
No. I came to persuade Pat
to be in my picture.

785
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:38.249
Oh. yes. "Hud Bannon."

786
01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:40.207
[chuckling] It's a bloody
awful title.

787
01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:41.469
You're gonna have to
change that.

788
01:03:41.513 --> 01:03:44.646
Already have.
It's just Hud now.

789
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:48.085
So you see Pat as a housekeeper.
do you?

790
01:03:48.128 --> 01:03:49.651
Oh. you read it. huh?

791
01:03:49.695 --> 01:03:52.045
- I skimmed through.
- What do you think?

792
01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:56.615
I think LA's a long way to go
for 20 pages.

793
01:03:56.658 --> 01:04:00.140
Well. you know the saying.
quality. not quantity.

794
01:04:00.184 --> 01:04:03.361
You didn't start out
as an agent. did you. Marty?

795
01:04:03.404 --> 01:04:05.058
Oh. now you're getting nasty.

796
01:04:05.102 --> 01:04:08.148
Trust me.
you haven't seen nasty yet.

797
01:04:08.192 --> 01:04:12.457
Oh. I work in Hollywood.
Trust me. I have.

798
01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.328
[chuckling]

799
01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:16.765
Yes. well. no.
I-- I commend you.

800
01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:19.203
Roald...

801
01:04:19.246 --> 01:04:21.814
I certainly wouldn't have the
gall to traipse all this way

802
01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:25.383
to offer Pat something
that's so...

803
01:04:25.426 --> 01:04:26.863
shit. what's the word?

804
01:04:28.647 --> 01:04:30.344
Beneath her.

805
01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:31.345
That's two words.

806
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.913
That's enough. Roald.

807
01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:36.263
The man asked my opinion.
darling.

808
01:04:36.307 --> 01:04:37.830
That's right.

809
01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:41.181
And opinions are important.
So here's mine.

810
01:04:43.096 --> 01:04:44.663
I've been here for you
every step of the way

811
01:04:44.706 --> 01:04:46.360
since Livvy died. and you.

812
01:04:46.404 --> 01:04:49.276
and you haven't been here
for me once.

813
01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.410
Something has to change.
and I am gonna change it.

814
01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:55.587
because. let's face it.
you never will.

815
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:58.895
You're too consumed with your
goddamn self-pity.

816
01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:03.247
So you stay here. Roald.
and you wallow.

817
01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:06.467
You. you bark at the world.
for all I care.

818
01:05:10.254 --> 01:05:11.211
Marty...

819
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:13.387
Thank you.

820
01:05:14.388 --> 01:05:15.694
I'm all yours.

821
01:05:21.743 --> 01:05:23.267
Congratulations. Marty.

822
01:05:25.747 --> 01:05:27.880
I'm glad it hasn't been
a wasted trip.

823
01:05:33.277 --> 01:05:34.408
Pat. you're being ridiculous.

824
01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:36.149
You're not ready
and you know it.

825
01:05:36.193 --> 01:05:40.414
Oh. mighty Roald. You know me so
much better than I know myself.

826
01:05:40.458 --> 01:05:42.982
Fine. Take the first bit part
that comes along.

827
01:05:43.026 --> 01:05:45.680
- It is not a bit part.
- It's 20 bloody pages.

828
01:05:45.724 --> 01:05:47.291
They won't even notice
you're not there.

829
01:05:50.424 --> 01:05:51.382
Thank you.

830
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:54.820
What for?

831
01:05:54.863 --> 01:05:59.303
For making it so goddamn easy
to go.

832
01:05:59.346 --> 01:06:03.568
Alright. Alright. fine. I...
[chuckling] I'm sorry. okay?

833
01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:08.007
I-- I was an arse. I'll call
Marty up. I'll-- I'll apologize.

834
01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:11.271
I just think
it isn't the right time.

835
01:06:11.315 --> 01:06:13.143
Will there ever be
the right time?

836
01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:22.413
Perhaps we both need some space.

837
01:06:22.456 --> 01:06:25.242
Space? Why do we need space?

838
01:06:25.285 --> 01:06:26.634
To think.

839
01:06:29.898 --> 01:06:31.291
What's there to think about?

840
01:06:41.432 --> 01:06:45.610
Now-- now. look. Pat.
I. I can change.

841
01:06:45.653 --> 01:06:46.611
I can.

842
01:06:49.266 --> 01:06:50.223
Yeah.

843
01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.401
People always say that
at the end.

844
01:06:54.445 --> 01:06:57.361

849
01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.778
Roald: Awful drive.

850
01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:55.000
Lorries kept holding us up
on narrow roads.

851
01:08:55.042 --> 01:08:57.959
Got to hospital. Ambulance went
to wrong entrance.

852
01:09:00.265 --> 01:09:02.050
I kissed her.

853
01:09:02.094 --> 01:09:03.050
She was warm.

854
01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:07.881
"Why is she so warm?"

855
01:09:07.925 --> 01:09:10.710
"Of course." he said. I left.

856
01:09:19.416 --> 01:09:21.157
We all become stories
in the end.

857
01:09:24.334 --> 01:09:26.901
So don't you think she'd like to
be remembered with a happy one?

858
01:09:35.693 --> 01:09:38.609
[instrumental music]

859
01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.314
Are you glad we came?

860
01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:50.011
It's pretty.

861
01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:52.797
You know.
I've always felt at home here.

862
01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.365
What about daddy?

863
01:09:55.407 --> 01:09:57.323
Daddy not so much.

864
01:09:57.367 --> 01:10:00.282
Does that mean he won't come?

865
01:10:00.326 --> 01:10:02.937
Would you like him to come?

866
01:10:02.981 --> 01:10:04.764
I don't want him lonely.

[music continues]

873
01:11:48.652 --> 01:11:49.914
So. you're worried?

874
01:11:51.829 --> 01:11:53.439
Not so much worried.

875
01:11:53.483 --> 01:11:55.353
Worried's what goes on in here.

876
01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:58.357
It's... well. it's more here
I'm all aflutter.

877
01:11:58.401 --> 01:12:00.359
And what about down here?

878
01:12:00.403 --> 01:12:02.013
What does my gut tell me?

879
01:12:02.056 --> 01:12:03.580
It's what I always listen to.

880
01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:08.759
You know.
I can't say I wasn't surprised

881
01:12:08.802 --> 01:12:11.327
when I heard
you were playing Alma.

882
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:12.632
I know.

883
01:12:12.675 --> 01:12:14.373
But I think I know her.

884
01:12:14.416 --> 01:12:16.157
Well. at least I thought I did.

885
01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:18.725
- And now you don't?
- Maybe.

886
01:12:20.901 --> 01:12:22.642
I-I...

887
01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:25.471
I don't know. Maybe I agreed to
do this for the wrong reasons.

888
01:12:25.514 --> 01:12:27.952
Get out of your head.

889
01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:30.084
Thinking like that'll
be the end of us all.

890
01:12:30.128 --> 01:12:32.522
That's easier said than done.

891
01:12:32.565 --> 01:12:34.132
And Paul wants to meet me
tomorrow

892
01:12:34.175 --> 01:12:36.656
to go through it with Marty.

893
01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.050
I'm worried he's gonna see
right through me.

894
01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:40.921
You know. these leading men...

895
01:12:42.053 --> 01:12:43.880
only see themselves.

896
01:12:43.924 --> 01:12:46.797
[both laughing]

897
01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:03.553
Mommy's home!

898
01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:09.166
[door opening]

899
01:13:10.124 --> 01:13:11.082
Hello?

900
01:13:16.782 --> 01:13:19.830
Well. what are you doing?

901
01:13:19.873 --> 01:13:22.572
Shh. We're hunting a bear.

902
01:13:22.615 --> 01:13:25.749
Oh! Well. that sounds terribly
dangerous.

903
01:13:25.791 --> 01:13:26.967
It's over there.

904
01:13:36.237 --> 01:13:37.237
Arrraaah!

905
01:13:37.282 --> 01:13:38.762
[Patricia gasping]

906
01:13:38.805 --> 01:13:39.850
[Roald grunting]

907
01:13:39.893 --> 01:13:40.894
What're you doing?!

908
01:13:40.938 --> 01:13:43.070
[both laughing]

909
01:13:43.114 --> 01:13:44.855
Tessa: No. no. no!
Roald: Oh. no. no! Wait!

910
01:13:44.898 --> 01:13:47.727
Wait. wait. No we've.
we've frightened mummy.

911
01:13:47.771 --> 01:13:49.294
What are you doing here?

912
01:13:49.337 --> 01:13:52.340
Well. I'm a bear.
I've been attacking her village.

913
01:13:52.384 --> 01:13:54.255
And she's an Apache brave
who's hunting me.

914
01:13:54.299 --> 01:13:55.474
[Tessa grunting]

915
01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:57.824
Tessa. go and play in your
bedroom.

916
01:13:57.868 --> 01:14:01.567
But I haven't killed the bear.

917
01:14:01.611 --> 01:14:04.352
Well. you can...
you can kill me later.

918
01:14:04.396 --> 01:14:06.005
[Roald sighing]

919
01:14:09.096 --> 01:14:11.098
Okay. but if you eat any more
villagers.

920
01:14:11.142 --> 01:14:12.577
I'm going to be very cross.

921
01:14:12.621 --> 01:14:15.014
Oh. right. Right you are.

922
01:14:15.059 --> 01:14:16.016
[Roald laughing]

923
01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:24.460
What happened to us both
wanting some space?

924
01:14:25.983 --> 01:14:28.289
Well. if you recall...

925
01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:30.291
it wasn't both of us.

926
01:14:44.175 --> 01:14:45.829
I'll have what you're having.

927
01:14:52.096 --> 01:14:54.490
I'm sorry. We've started out
all wrong. haven't we?

928
01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.977
How's the film?

929
01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:05.762
Couldn't be better.

930
01:15:05.805 --> 01:15:07.719
Well. that is good.

931
01:15:07.764 --> 01:15:10.723
Well. if it's all the same to
you. I'll. I'll stick around.

932
01:15:10.767 --> 01:15:13.073
pick up your laundry. help with
the kids. that sort of thing.

933
01:15:15.206 --> 01:15:18.818
You never know.
I might come in useful.

934
01:15:18.862 --> 01:15:19.818
Chin-chin.

935
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:36.749
- Daddy?
- Yes?

936
01:15:36.793 --> 01:15:40.927
Would you be angry
if I'd done something?

937
01:15:40.971 --> 01:15:44.017
That would depend entirely
what it was you'd done.

938
01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:49.545
I only did it so mummy
could read it to me.

939
01:15:54.027 --> 01:15:56.334
You always told Livvy
your stories and not me.

940
01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:02.601
Are you angry?

941
01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:07.737
No.

942
01:16:08.607 --> 01:16:09.565
No.

943
01:16:14.134 --> 01:16:18.356
- What did you think?
- I still don't like the owls.

944
01:16:18.398 --> 01:16:21.489
I see. Well. anything else?

945
01:16:21.532 --> 01:16:27.757
Well... maybe the river could be
chocolate instead.

946
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.456
There could be this big
marshmallow mountain.

947
01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:33.632
And then maybe
a butterscotch river.

948
01:16:33.675 --> 01:16:35.852
I like that.
That's a very good idea.

949
01:16:35.895 --> 01:16:37.157
[both laughing]

950
01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:41.161
[phone ringing]

951
01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:51.302
Patricia Neal for Paul Newman.

952
01:16:51.344 --> 01:16:53.173
- Come in.
- Thank you.

953
01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:02.182
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

954
01:17:14.499 --> 01:17:15.718
Marty: Hm.

955
01:17:15.761 --> 01:17:17.589
[door opening]

956
01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.982
Paul: There she is.

957
01:17:19.025 --> 01:17:21.941
Paul. It's so great to
see you again.

958
01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:24.814
Pat.

959
01:17:24.857 --> 01:17:27.599
Oh. Marty.

960
01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.166
Marty: We thought you might have
gotten lost.

961
01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:31.298
Only in this house.
It's enormous.

962
01:17:31.342 --> 01:17:32.691
Thrilled to have you on board.
Pat.

963
01:17:32.735 --> 01:17:35.999
Patricia: Oh. I'm thrilled
you wanted me.

964
01:17:36.041 --> 01:17:38.130
So. Pat likes the script.
Don't you. Pat?

965
01:17:38.175 --> 01:17:40.177
Absolutely. I adore it.

966
01:17:40.219 --> 01:17:41.482
Glad to hear it. Me too.

967
01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.661
Patricia: Great.

968
01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.358
So. as we were saying
earlier. Paul.

969
01:17:47.401 --> 01:17:48.880
I think what Pat can bring
to the part--

970
01:17:48.925 --> 01:17:51.231
So how come it took you so long
to say yes. then?

971
01:17:51.275 --> 01:17:53.581
I'm just curious. Marty. is all.

972
01:17:53.625 --> 01:17:57.803
Scripts like this don't come
along every day.

973
01:17:57.847 --> 01:18:00.240
- Wouldn't you agree. Pat?
- Of course.

974
01:18:00.284 --> 01:18:02.242
So it's natural to wonder...

975
01:18:03.766 --> 01:18:05.028
why all the gaming?

976
01:18:13.776 --> 01:18:17.344
So. how come it took you so long
to say yes?

977
01:18:19.346 --> 01:18:25.483
You may have heard my.
my daughter. Olivia. she...

978
01:18:25.526 --> 01:18:27.702
I heard.

979
01:18:27.746 --> 01:18:29.226
Now. what does someone
say to that?

980
01:18:29.269 --> 01:18:30.967
Oh. you don't need to
say anything.

981
01:18:34.405 --> 01:18:36.233
Shit happens. right?

982
01:18:37.495 --> 01:18:40.280
Yeah. Shit happens.

983
01:18:42.934 --> 01:18:45.764
So. I've got a crazy idea.
Let's talk about "Hud."

984
01:18:45.808 --> 01:18:47.287
You got a favorite scene. Pat?

985
01:18:49.376 --> 01:18:51.727
Favorite scene? Um...

986
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:55.948
Well. there are so many of them.

987
01:18:55.992 --> 01:18:59.952
Well. there's the car.
and. well. the bus station.

988
01:18:59.996 --> 01:19:01.562
I love that scene.

989
01:19:01.606 --> 01:19:03.869
That's some great writing.

990
01:19:03.913 --> 01:19:07.916
- You off book yet?
- What? Sure.

991
01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.309
Up for throwing some
lines around?

992
01:19:09.353 --> 01:19:10.746
Paul. you're not being fair.

993
01:19:10.789 --> 01:19:12.312
You haven't given the lady
any warning.

994
01:19:12.356 --> 01:19:14.880
She said she's off book.

995
01:19:14.924 --> 01:19:16.577
Sure. No-- no.
I-- I-- I'm ready.

996
01:19:23.062 --> 01:19:24.020
Well...

997
01:19:26.109 --> 01:19:29.155
Looks like we're losing
a good cook.

998
01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:32.463
Maybe we should have boosted
your salary a little.

999
01:19:32.505 --> 01:19:33.769
You ain't letting that
little ruckus we had

1000
01:19:33.812 --> 01:19:36.859
run you off. are you?

1001
01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:38.643
As far as I can get on
a bus ticket.

1002
01:19:41.646 --> 01:19:42.821
You claiming
I'm the first guy who ever

1003
01:19:42.865 --> 01:19:44.388
stuck his foot
in your door?

1004
01:19:44.431 --> 01:19:45.389
No.

1005
01:19:47.391 --> 01:19:50.307
First one who ever got rough.
huh?

1006
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:52.352
Well. I'm sorry.

1007
01:19:52.396 --> 01:19:54.485
That ain't my style.

1008
01:19:54.528 --> 01:19:57.443
I don't usually get rough
with my women.

1009
01:19:57.487 --> 01:19:59.925
I generally don't have to.

1010
01:19:59.969 --> 01:20:02.188
- You're tough on everyone.
- Rough.

1011
01:20:02.232 --> 01:20:04.147
What?

1012
01:20:04.190 --> 01:20:07.628
It's "You're rough on
everybody." not "tough."

1013
01:20:07.672 --> 01:20:09.195
The clue's in the line.

1014
01:20:10.893 --> 01:20:13.547
Oh. okay. alright.

1015
01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:15.332
I don't usually get rough
with my women.

1016
01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:18.422
I generally don't have to.

1017
01:20:18.465 --> 01:20:20.337
You're rough on everyone.

1018
01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:21.686
So they tell me.

1019
01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:27.300
You want to know
something funny?

1020
01:20:27.344 --> 01:20:28.475
It would have happened
eventually

1021
01:20:28.519 --> 01:20:31.348
without the roughhouse.

1022
01:20:31.391 --> 01:20:33.393
You look pretty good without
your shirt on. you know.

1023
01:20:37.005 --> 01:20:40.313
You look pretty good
without your shirt on...

1024
01:20:40.357 --> 01:20:41.314
Uh...

1025
01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:46.666
The sight of that through
the kitchen window

1026
01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:49.322
made me put my dishcloth
down more than once.

1027
01:20:53.282 --> 01:20:55.546
Why didn't you say something
sooner?

1028
01:20:55.589 --> 01:20:56.547
Well...

1029
01:20:57.983 --> 01:21:00.202
I'll remember you. honey.

1030
01:21:00.246 --> 01:21:01.421
You're the one that got away.

1031
01:21:10.778 --> 01:21:12.302
Wanna. wanna go again?

1032
01:21:15.609 --> 01:21:16.567
No.

1033
01:21:21.702 --> 01:21:24.183
You. ah...

1034
01:21:24.227 --> 01:21:25.445
play pool. Pat?

1035
01:21:28.057 --> 01:21:30.973
[birds squawking]

1036
01:21:32.975 --> 01:21:35.891
- How was your day. dear?
- Oh. just peachy.

1037
01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:38.981
- Do you want to talk about it?
- Really not.

1038
01:21:39.023 --> 01:21:40.764
I'm guessing
it didn't go so well.

1039
01:21:40.808 --> 01:21:43.333
Well. that's the understatement
of the year.

1040
01:21:43.376 --> 01:21:45.291
Probably checking on
Shelley Winters as we speak.

1041
01:21:45.335 --> 01:21:47.554
Oh. I'm sure that's not true.

1042
01:21:47.598 --> 01:21:50.688
Unfortunately.
I can't even blame him.

1043
01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:52.385
I thought I had her.

1044
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.215
Well. I did say.

1045
01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.523
Did say what?

1046
01:21:59.566 --> 01:22:01.481
That Alma probably
wasn't for you.

1047
01:22:03.092 --> 01:22:05.485
Is this you being supportive?

1048
01:22:05.529 --> 01:22:07.443
Well. I mean. she's not
what you're known for.

1049
01:22:07.487 --> 01:22:09.968
- Not a fox fur in sight.
- Is that supposed to be funny?

1050
01:22:10.012 --> 01:22:12.579
Well. all I mean is she's
a complex creature.

1051
01:22:12.623 --> 01:22:15.931
- She's not had an easy life.
- And what? I have?

1052
01:22:15.974 --> 01:22:17.584
She's sexual. she's confident.

1053
01:22:17.628 --> 01:22:18.846
but she's been through
the wringer.

1054
01:22:18.889 --> 01:22:21.719
She's been used.
She's vulnerable. She...

1055
01:22:21.762 --> 01:22:23.677
It's a lot to ask
of any actress.

1056
01:22:23.721 --> 01:22:27.246
Screw you. Roald.
I get her. I do.

1057
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:30.032
Well. getting her is one thing.
playing her is quite another.

1058
01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:31.859
I mean right now.

1059
01:22:31.903 --> 01:22:35.210
What with Livvy and...

1060
01:22:35.254 --> 01:22:36.212
No.

1061
01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:41.478
Alma has known that sort of pain
her whole life.

1062
01:22:41.521 --> 01:22:45.090
It's there on every page.
Livvy is the reason I can do it.

1063
01:22:45.134 --> 01:22:46.526
Then what's the problem?

1064
01:22:54.925 --> 01:22:56.493
What are you doing?

1065
01:22:56.536 --> 01:22:57.973
Well. just stating the obvious.
darling.

1066
01:23:02.151 --> 01:23:06.329
[laughing] You bastard.

1067
01:23:06.371 --> 01:23:09.853
You bastard.

1068
01:23:09.897 --> 01:23:12.117
I don't know what you're talking
about. Pat.

1069
01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:14.598
Why didn't you just come
right out and say it?

1070
01:23:14.641 --> 01:23:17.731
Would you have listened?

1071
01:23:17.775 --> 01:23:19.559
You're an idiot.

1072
01:23:30.353 --> 01:23:32.094
No.

1073
01:23:32.137 --> 01:23:33.704
No kiss.

1074
01:23:33.746 --> 01:23:37.055
- What? Not even a little one?
- No. that's it.

1075
01:23:37.099 --> 01:23:38.621
Not even a little one.

1076
01:23:38.665 --> 01:23:41.581
[instrumental music]

1077
01:23:59.512 --> 01:24:01.384
Paul. Marty.

1078
01:24:01.427 --> 01:24:03.559
Is everything okay?
We weren't expecting to see you.

1079
01:24:03.603 --> 01:24:05.127
I know what was wrong.

1080
01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:07.129
- Wrong with what?
- The bus station.

1081
01:24:07.172 --> 01:24:09.782
Ah. we were just talking about
that. Paul and I have an idea.

1082
01:24:09.827 --> 01:24:11.655
- We might go in a different...
- The scene is fine. It was me.

1083
01:24:11.698 --> 01:24:13.309
- I was all wrong.
- No. Pat.

1084
01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:14.309
Marty.

1085
01:24:17.791 --> 01:24:18.749
Alright?

1086
01:24:26.452 --> 01:24:29.107
Looks like we're losing
a good cook.

1087
01:24:29.151 --> 01:24:30.848
Maybe we should have boosted
your salary a little.

1088
01:24:35.635 --> 01:24:37.115
You ain't letting that
little ruckus we had

1089
01:24:37.159 --> 01:24:38.550
run you off. are you?

1090
01:24:38.594 --> 01:24:40.075
Far as I can get
on a bus ticket.

1091
01:24:43.425 --> 01:24:44.688
You claiming I'm the first guy

1092
01:24:44.731 --> 01:24:46.733
who ever stuck his foot
in your door?

1093
01:24:46.777 --> 01:24:47.734
No.

1094
01:24:50.693 --> 01:24:52.652
First one who ever got rough.
huh?

1095
01:24:54.611 --> 01:24:57.483
Well. I'm sorry.
Ain't my style.

1096
01:24:57.527 --> 01:25:00.398
I don't usually get rough
with my women.

1097
01:25:00.443 --> 01:25:05.925
I... generally don't have to.

1098
01:25:05.969 --> 01:25:07.666
You're rough on everybody.

1099
01:25:13.891 --> 01:25:16.023
So they tell me.

1100
01:25:16.067 --> 01:25:17.503
You want to know
something funny?

1101
01:25:19.853 --> 01:25:21.028
It would have happened
eventually

1102
01:25:21.072 --> 01:25:23.901
without the roughhouse.

1103
01:25:23.943 --> 01:25:27.034
You look pretty good without
your shirt on. you know.

1104
01:25:27.077 --> 01:25:28.558
The sight of that through
the kitchen window

1105
01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:30.603
made me put my dish towel
down more than once.

1106
01:25:33.650 --> 01:25:34.955
Why didn't you say something
sooner?

1107
01:25:36.174 --> 01:25:37.132
Well...

1108
01:25:40.178 --> 01:25:42.005
No. No. No kiss.

1109
01:25:42.049 --> 01:25:45.139
She just walks straight to the
bus and not even look back.

1110
01:25:51.276 --> 01:25:52.234
Yeah.

1111
01:25:53.409 --> 01:25:54.366
[chuckling]

1112
01:25:56.237 --> 01:25:57.717
That is the bus station scene.

1113
01:26:04.507 --> 01:26:08.424
[instrumental music]

1114
01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:37.452
[music continues]

1115
01:26:50.335 --> 01:26:52.511
- Has she read it?
- Shh. shh. shh.

1116
01:26:52.555 --> 01:26:54.731
- Has she read it?
- Shh. shh. shh.

1117
01:26:54.773 --> 01:26:55.732
Last page.

1118
01:27:06.003 --> 01:27:06.960
It's alright.

1119
01:27:08.397 --> 01:27:10.398
I know it's good this time.

1120
01:27:10.442 --> 01:27:11.400
Do you know how good?

1121
01:27:12.575 --> 01:27:14.620
Mmm... [chuckling]

1122
01:27:15.969 --> 01:27:17.493
Any notes?

1123
01:27:17.536 --> 01:27:20.626
You know. I-- I do have one.

1124
01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:23.107
Oh.

1125
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:27.154
You promise you won't change
a single line?

1126
01:27:27.198 --> 01:27:28.155
[Tessa laughing]

1127
01:27:31.157 --> 01:27:34.639
He's a clever daddy. isn't he?
Isn't he a clever daddy?

1128
01:27:34.684 --> 01:27:36.032
- Isn't he?
- Yes!

1129
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:44.389
Gregory: The nominees for best
performance by an actress are.

Leslie Caron.

01:27:51.701 --> 01:27:54.312
Shirley MacLaine.
in "Irma La Douce."

1133
01:27:54.356 --> 01:27:58.403
who allowed us a glimpse of the
late. late show in Paris.

1134
01:27:58.447 --> 01:28:02.973
Natalie Wood. in "Love With The
Proper Stranger." is the proof

1135
01:28:03.016 --> 01:28:07.760
that it was a big year for girls
in technical difficulty.

1136
01:28:07.804 --> 01:28:10.154
Patricia Neal. in "Hud."

1137
01:28:10.197 --> 01:28:12.764
for her portrayal
of the slovenly.

1138
01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:14.289
affectionate housekeeper.

1139
01:28:17.683 --> 01:28:20.338
Rachel Roberts.
in "This Sporting Life."

1140
01:28:20.382 --> 01:28:23.646
for her portrait of the
repressed young widow.

1141
01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:26.170
[audience applauding]

1142
01:28:27.344 --> 01:28:28.999
And the winner...

01:28:29.041 --> 01:28:32.263
"The King Of Breakfasts."

1144
01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:33.786
Now. don't go into labor
or something. but...

1145
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:35.222
Gregory: ...Patricia Neal.

1146
01:28:35.266 --> 01:28:38.400
...you've only gone
and won a bloody Oscar.

1147
01:28:38.443 --> 01:28:40.358
No! No!

1148
01:28:40.402 --> 01:28:43.927
Didn't I say you'd squeeze every
last drop out of those 20 pages.

1149
01:28:43.969 --> 01:28:45.450
Is that what you said?

1150
01:28:45.494 --> 01:28:47.059
Isn't mummy clever?

1151
01:28:48.975 --> 01:28:50.585
[gasping]

1152
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:52.065
Isn't mummy clever?

1153
01:28:55.504 --> 01:28:57.201
No.

1154
01:28:57.244 --> 01:28:59.290
Tessa: Oh. my God!

1155
01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:01.901

[instrumental music]

1157
01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:19.179
Man 1: Mr. Dahl.
did you have any idea

1158
01:29:19.223 --> 01:29:22.052
just how successful that book
was going to end up becoming?

1159
01:29:22.094 --> 01:29:23.923
Roald: No. none whatsoever.
Never have.

1160
01:29:23.967 --> 01:29:25.751
I just hope someone likes them.

1161
01:29:25.795 --> 01:29:27.840
I have to say a great many
people all over the world

1162
01:29:27.884 --> 01:29:29.407
loved "Charlie And The
Chocolate Factory"

1163
01:29:29.451 --> 01:29:30.800
particularly.

1164
01:29:30.843 --> 01:29:32.802
Roald: Yes.
it does seem that way.

1165
01:29:32.844 --> 01:29:34.630
Man 1: In fact. many people
have called it

1166
01:29:34.673 --> 01:29:37.546
one of the finest
children's books.

1167
01:29:37.589 --> 01:29:39.286
Roald: Well.
I don't know about that.

1168
01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:40.853
but I'm quite happy with it.

1169
01:29:40.897 --> 01:29:43.202
Tessa: Daddy! Mummy!
Look at them!

1170
01:29:43.246 --> 01:29:45.641
- Mummy. look! Livvy's birds!
- Roald!

1171
01:29:45.684 --> 01:29:48.818
Patricia: Roald. come on out!
They're back!

1172
01:29:48.861 --> 01:29:52.212
Tess: Look they're even flying!
Look!

1173
01:29:52.255 --> 01:29:53.431
- Look at that.
- Daddy. come and look.

1174
01:29:53.475 --> 01:29:54.476

[instrumental music]

1177
01:30:15.584 --> 01:30:18.237
Roald: Perhaps there's a part
of me that became a storyteller

1178
01:30:18.282 --> 01:30:21.764
so I could choose
what happens next.

1179
01:30:21.807 --> 01:30:25.811
Because. of course. real life
doesn't let you do that.

1180
01:30:25.855 --> 01:30:30.468
Over the years I dedicated
books to all my children.

1181
01:30:30.512 --> 01:30:34.037
To Lucy. to Ophelia. to Theo...

1182
01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.038
to Tessa.

1183
01:30:36.735 --> 01:30:38.998
