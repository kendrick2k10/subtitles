00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:47.958
<i>By the time</i>
<i>Master Geppetto made Pinocchio.</i>

4
00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:49.916
<i>he had already lost a son.</i>

5
00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:55.333
<i>Now this was quite a few years</i>
<i>before my time.</i>

6
00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:57.416
<i>but I learnt the story.</i>

7
00:00:57.916 --> 00:00:59.458
<i>And then it became my story.</i>

8
00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:06.791
<i>Geppetto lost Carlo during the Great War.</i>

9
00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:09.583
<i>They'd been together only ten years.</i>

10
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:15.416
<i>But it was as if Carlo had taken</i>
<i>the old man's life with him.</i>

11
00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:30.166
Whoa.

12
00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:34.833
Whoa!

13
00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:46.416
-Papa! Papa!
-Yes?

14
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.416
-Guess what I saw?
-What?

15
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.541
-Guess!
-I've no idea.

16
00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:54.333
-I saw some planes!
-Oh. did you? Good.

17
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:58.291
-What is it you're making this time. Papa?
-Guess!

18
00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:00.833
-A soldier? A magician? A witch?
-No.

19
00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:04.416
No! No. no. no. no. no.
you have to wait and see. Carlo!

20
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.916
-All good things require patience.

21
00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:09.291
Huh.

22
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.625
<i>They wanted for nothing.</i>

23
00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:17.250
In the name of the Father.
the Son. and the Holy Spirit.

24
00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.833
<i>All they needed</i>
<i>was each other's company.</i>

25
00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:23.833
And the old witch
warned the little hedgehog.

26
00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:30.583
"Do not tell lies.
or your nose will grow and grow

27
00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:31.791
up to here!"

28
00:02:34.416 --> 00:02:36.083
His nose would grow?

29
00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:41.041
Lies. my dear boy.
are found out immediately

30
00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.416
because they are like long noses.

31
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.583
visible to all but the teller of the lie.

32
00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:52.208
And the more you lie. the more it grows!

33
00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:02.583
Sing me Mama's song so I can sleep.
Please. Papa?

34
00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:04.791
All right.

35
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.458
-Higher. Papa! Higher!

36
00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:45.708
Try it.

37
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.208
-Thank you. ladies.

38
00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:03.541
-For you.

39
00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:05.666
-For me?

40
00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:30.666
Pull. Carlo! Pull!

41
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.083
-Magnificent job. Geppetto.

42
00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:35.666
-Thank you.

43
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:43.791
Watch out. Carlo!

44
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:53.166
When one life is lost.
another must grow.

45
00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:55.750
How about this one?

46
00:04:57.291 --> 00:04:59.208
No. no. no. no. Carlo.

47
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.375
It has to be perfect. Complete!

48
00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:02.458
See?

49
00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:06.333
This one's missing some of its scales.

50
00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:38.166
Good night. Papa.

51
00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:41.708
Good night. my son.

52
00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:46.125
I love my new shoes. Papa!

53
00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:48.625
I am very glad. Carlo.

54
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:52.333
-We're going to church first. right?
-Oh. yes. Yes.

55
00:05:54.916 --> 00:05:56.208
Hello there. little dog!

56
00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:01.791
<i>Buongiorno. Geppetto.</i>

57
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.916
-Morning!
-Morning.

58
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.750
Master Geppetto.
you gonna finish the crucifix today?

59
00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:10.333
We're gonna do our best.

60
00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:14.333
-Ladies.
-Aw. such a perfectionist.

61
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:20.333
A model Italian citizen.

62
00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:21.916
And such a good father.

63
00:06:25.208 --> 00:06:27.708
Carlo. nice shoes. Catch!

64
00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:29.208
Thank you. sir!

65
00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:30.750
-Good morning.
-Hi!

66
00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:36.541
-<i>Buongiorno.</i>
-<i>Buongiorno. Dottore!</i>

67
00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:41.625
Ah. Carlo.

68
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.583
Geppetto.

69
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.333
Yes…

70
00:06:57.416 --> 00:06:59.041
-It looks great. Papa.
-Oh.

71
00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:01.666
Is it almost time to go home?

72
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.208
Almost!

73
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:06.250
-Send up a little more red for me. Carlo.

74
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:18.875
Oh! I forgot to show you what I found.

75
00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.166
What is it. my boy?

76
00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:22.541
You'll see.

77
00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:31.083
-Ta-da!

78
00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:33.958
The perfect pine cone.

79
00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:36.000
It still has all its scales!

80
00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:39.375
I thought I could plant it myself
and watch the tree grow.

81
00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.416
And then carve toys for myself.
Like you do.

82
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.875
I think that's as good an idea
as any boy ever had. Carlo.

83
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.500
Isn't it?

84
00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:00.833
What's that sound. Papa? Is it a plane?

85
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.541
Gather the tools.

86
00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:05.958
Quickly.

87
00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:11.916
We'll go home to a warm fire and hot soup.

88
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.541
-Could we have some hot chocolate too?
-Sure. Sure.

89
00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:17.583
It seems like a hot chocolate sort of day.
doesn't it?

90
00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:19.583
Oh. yes. yes. yes. Fine.

91
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.833
Papa! What is it?

92
00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:24.500
Nothing. I'm sure it's nothing but…

93
00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:26.583
Oh. wait. My pine cone!

94
00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:38.666
<i>It was later said Geppetto's</i>
<i>little town was not even a target.</i>

95
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.083
<i>That these planes</i>
<i>were heading back to base</i>

96
00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:47.416
<i>and simply let go of their bombs</i>
<i>to make their ballasts lighter.</i>

97
00:08:56.458 --> 00:08:57.291
Carlo!

98
00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:05.083
Ah!

99
00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:18.458
Huh?

100
00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:23.666
Huh?

101
00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:26.208
No…

102
00:09:32.958 --> 00:09:34.041
Carlo.

103
00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:21.041
<i>Geppetto never left his side.</i>
<i>And that was that.</i>

104
00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:25.375
<i>He worked very little. He ate even less.</i>

105
00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:29.625
<i>And the church's crucifix</i>
<i>remained unfinished.</i>

106
00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:36.958
-<i>The years passed.</i>

107
00:10:40.666 --> 00:10:42.083
<i>The world moved on…</i>

108
00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:47.083
<i>but Geppetto did not.</i>

109
00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:04.208
<i>And this is where I come in.</i>

110
00:11:08.666 --> 00:11:10.333
<i>You see. I was a writer.</i>

111
00:11:10.416 --> 00:11:12.958
<i>And for years. I'd been looking</i>
<i>for the ideal conditions to set</i>

112
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:16.541
<i>my illustrious.</i>
<i>fascinating life story to paper.</i>

113
00:11:24.458 --> 00:11:25.750
<i>Until. at long last.</i>

114
00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:28.250
<i>I found it.</i>

115
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.958
<i>My sanctuary.</i>

116
00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:34.500
<i>Home.</i>

117
00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:35.666
Ah.

118
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.125
<i>Here I could write my memoirs.</i>
<i>And what a tale it would be.</i>

119
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:44.333
<i>I had lived</i>
<i>in a barrister's fireplace in Sardinia.</i>

120
00:11:44.416 --> 00:11:46.708
<i>sailed on the Adriatic in a fishing boat.</i>

121
00:11:46.791 --> 00:11:50.916
<i>nested one Perugian winter</i>
<i>with an acclaimed sculptor.</i>

Stridulations of My Youth

123
00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.708
<i>by Sebastian J. Cricket.</i>

124
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:04.000
I dreamed of you. Carlo.

125
00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:11.833
I dreamed you were
right back here with me.

126
00:12:14.208 --> 00:12:15.208
My son.

127
00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:19.083
Oh dear.

128
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.750
If only I could have you back.

129
00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:26.416
I am so sorry.

130
00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:32.041
<i>I watched the old man weep.</i>
<i>And it moved me.</i>

131
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.833
<i>And it turns out</i>
<i>that I wasn't the only one watching him.</i>

132
00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:41.166
<i>In my many wanderings on this earth.</i>

133
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:46.083
<i>I've learned that there are old spirits</i>
<i>living in the mountains. in the forests.</i>

134
00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:49.083
<i>who rarely involve themselves</i>
<i>in the human world.</i>

135
00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:51.500
<i>But on occasion. they do.</i>

136
00:12:53.208 --> 00:12:55.208
I want you back. Carlo.

137
00:12:56.916 --> 00:12:59.291
Right here!

138
00:13:00.416 --> 00:13:01.541
With me!

139
00:13:02.833 --> 00:13:06.208
-Why won't you listen to my prayers?

140
00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:08.000
Why?

141
00:13:12.916 --> 00:13:14.208
Where were we?

142
00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:16.750
Ah yes. Perug--

143
00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:18.416
-Whoa!

144
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.875
What in my antennae?

145
00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:25.875
I will have him back.

146
00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:30.166
I'll make Carlo again…

147
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.750
Wha-- Hey!

148
00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:35.041
…out of this accursed pine!

149
00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.458
Whoa! Ah!

150
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.583
-What on earth?!

151
00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:04.791
No!

152
00:14:10.833 --> 00:14:12.875
-Ah! Ooh! Yah!

153
00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.291
It's a house of horrors!

154
00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.000
Ah!

155
00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:30.875
Ah!

156
00:14:31.583 --> 00:14:32.916
Ah!

157
00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:24.666
Huh?

158
00:15:29.916 --> 00:15:34.375
I… I will finish you tomorrow.

159
00:15:35.041 --> 00:15:37.166
Yes. tomorrow.

160
00:15:42.875 --> 00:15:44.750
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

161
00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:46.666
Hey! Get away from there. Go away!

162
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.708
Bugger off.

163
00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:53.208
No. no. no. no. no. no. This is my home!

164
00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:54.875
No trespassing. Go! Go! Go! Go!

165
00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.583
Get away from here. Go away! Go away!

166
00:15:57.666 --> 00:15:58.750
Yes. that's right.

167
00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:27.458
Little wooden boy.

168
00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:32.000
may you rise with the sun
and walk the earth.

169
00:16:32.083 --> 00:16:35.833
Excuse me. Can I help you?
This is my home we're talking about.

170
00:16:37.458 --> 00:16:40.416
May I ask. who on earth are you?

171
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.500
On earth?

172
00:16:42.583 --> 00:16:43.750
A guardian.

173
00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:46.333
-I care for the little things…

174
00:16:46.416 --> 00:16:47.875
…the forgotten things.

175
00:16:47.958 --> 00:16:49.250
the lost ones.

176
00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:52.750
Well. I am
Sebastian J. Cricket. homeowner.

177
00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:56.500
And I have every right to be consulted
about your schemes and machinations

178
00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.333
regarding my property.

179
00:16:58.416 --> 00:17:03.166
Well. since you already live
in the heart of the wooden boy.

180
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.625
perhaps you can help me.

181
00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:06.166
Help you what?

182
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.125
To watch over him.

183
00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:10.708
Guide him to be good.

184
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:12.625
I'm not a governess. madam.

185
00:17:12.708 --> 00:17:15.250
I'm a novelist. a raconteur.

186
00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:18.041
currently immersed in writing my memoirs.

187
00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:22.541
Well. in this world.
you get what you give.

188
00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:27.875
Take on this responsibility.
and I will grant you one wish.

189
00:17:27.958 --> 00:17:30.291
And that could be anything?

190
00:17:30.375 --> 00:17:31.625
Anything at all?

191
00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:33.458
The publication of my book?

192
00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:34.875
Fame? Fortune?

193
00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.291
Anything.

194
00:17:36.375 --> 00:17:37.208
Oh.

195
00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:41.375
Maybe I can help. I'll try my best.
and that's the best anyone can do.

196
00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.625
That's rather clever. isn't it?

197
00:17:44.583 --> 00:17:47.250
Little wooden boy made of pine.

198
00:17:48.416 --> 00:17:51.875
we shall call you Pinocchio.

199
00:17:52.458 --> 00:17:54.250
May you rise with the sun

200
00:17:55.583 --> 00:17:57.375
and wander the earth…

201
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.541
Ah!

202
00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:08.166
…and bring joy and company
to that poor heartbroken man.

203
00:18:09.083 --> 00:18:10.250
Be his son.

204
00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:16.625
Fill his days with light
so he'll never be alone.

205
00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:36.958
Ah.

206
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.625
Huh.

207
00:19:21.916 --> 00:19:23.375
Who goes there?

208
00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:29.458
I'm… I'm warning you!

209
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.416
I… I have a weapon!

210
00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:44.375
-Wha--

211
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.875
Good morning. Papa!

212
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.000
What is this? What kind of sorcery?

213
00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:01.666
You wanted me to live.
You asked for me to live.

214
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.083
Who… Who are you?

215
00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:07.625
My name is Pinocchio!

216
00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:09.083
I'm your son!

217
00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:12.500
You are not my son! Don't come near me!

218
00:20:12.583 --> 00:20:14.458
The boy's telling the truth.
Master Geppetto!

219
00:20:14.541 --> 00:20:16.875
It's full of cockroaches!

220
00:20:17.375 --> 00:20:18.583
Ah!

221
00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:22.833
Ugh.

222
00:20:23.625 --> 00:20:24.583
Ah!

223
00:20:42.416 --> 00:20:43.791
Wow!

224
00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:45.291
Ah! Huh?

225
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:48.291
What is this?

226
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.708
Huh? No. no. get away from me!

227
00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:02.916
You… You stand back! Don't come near me!

228
00:21:09.666 --> 00:21:12.000
It's a clock. Don't touch it.

229
00:21:13.875 --> 00:21:16.083
It sings at six o'clock.

230
00:21:19.416 --> 00:21:21.416
No! Ah!

231
00:21:27.833 --> 00:21:29.041
That's a hammer.

232
00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:33.750
You tap. You smash. You shatter.

233
00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:36.208
-Ugh!

234
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.833
-Uh. a ch… chamber pot.

235
00:22:10.416 --> 00:22:14.041
-Um. uh. I… Oh.

236
00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:18.791
-Ah!

237
00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:31.333
-Don't…

238
00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:35.958
You must stop!

239
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.416
That was so much fun. Papa!

240
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.625
You're not my son!

241
00:22:48.416 --> 00:22:50.250
What is wrong with you?

242
00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:52.541
Papa?

243
00:22:54.291 --> 00:22:55.416
I'm sorry.

244
00:23:14.625 --> 00:23:16.083
I. uh…

245
00:23:19.541 --> 00:23:22.500
Just stay here. Don't come out.

246
00:23:24.166 --> 00:23:25.666
Time for church.

247
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.375
-Church? I wanna go to church.
Stay there.

248
00:23:28.458 --> 00:23:30.333
-Church! Church!
-Do you understand?

249
00:23:30.416 --> 00:23:32.291
Church! Church! Church! Church!

250
00:23:33.625 --> 00:23:34.500
Church!

251
00:23:34.583 --> 00:23:36.666
No. no. he told you to stay.

252
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:41.458
-I'm going to church! I'm going to church!
-No. no. no! Please. stop!

253
00:23:41.541 --> 00:23:42.708
You must obey your papa.

254
00:23:43.708 --> 00:23:44.541
Obey?

255
00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:46.500
To do as you're told!

256
00:23:46.583 --> 00:23:48.583
But I don't want to obey!

257
00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:50.708
Well…

258
00:23:50.791 --> 00:23:54.708
…you must try your best.
and that's the best anybody can do.

259
00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:00.750
-I'm going to church!

260
00:24:00.833 --> 00:24:03.416
I'm going to church!

261
00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:10.125
Whoa!

262
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.708
-Hi!

263
00:24:18.958 --> 00:24:20.125
Okay. bye!

264
00:24:22.083 --> 00:24:22.958
Hmm.

265
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.791
Oops.

266
00:24:26.666 --> 00:24:28.666
Uh. uh. ah!

267
00:25:04.416 --> 00:25:07.583
-Look. Father. over there!

268
00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:09.041
What is that?

269
00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:12.250
Papa!

270
00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:14.541
-It speaks!

271
00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:18.791
Papa! Papa! Over here!

272
00:25:18.875 --> 00:25:20.166
Pinocchio.

273
00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:21.583
It's me!

274
00:25:21.666 --> 00:25:23.750
I came to church.

275
00:25:23.833 --> 00:25:26.458
-It's a demon!
-Witchcraft!

276
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:27.458
<i>Malocchio!</i>

277
00:25:27.541 --> 00:25:28.666
Pinocchio.

278
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.625
No! No. please!

279
00:25:30.708 --> 00:25:33.625
It's… It's a puppet
to… to entertain!

280
00:25:33.708 --> 00:25:36.083
If he's a puppet. where are his strings?

281
00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:39.166
That's true. Who controls you. wooden boy?

282
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.250
Of course. I control him--

283
00:25:41.333 --> 00:25:42.708
Who controls you?

284
00:25:45.833 --> 00:25:49.666
No one talks to the Podesta like that.

285
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.041
He… He's a puppet. Just a puppet!

286
00:25:52.125 --> 00:25:56.041
No. I'm not. I'm made
of flesh and bone and meaty bits!

287
00:25:56.125 --> 00:25:58.708
-I'm a real boy!

288
00:25:58.791 --> 00:26:00.958
-A monster!
-Demon!

289
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:04.083
-It's an abomination.

290
00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:07.458
-This is the work of the devil!
-Enough!

291
00:26:07.958 --> 00:26:11.583
This is a house of God.

292
00:26:11.666 --> 00:26:13.041
You drunken fool!

293
00:26:13.125 --> 00:26:14.791
You carving this… this thing

294
00:26:14.875 --> 00:26:18.166
while our blessed Christ
hangs unfinished all these years?

295
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.750
Take that unholy thing away.
Take it away! Now!

296
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.708
Yes. Yes. Padre.

297
00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:26.833
-Shame on you. Geppetto!
-Burn him!

298
00:26:26.916 --> 00:26:28.208
-So sorry.
-Chop him up!

299
00:26:28.291 --> 00:26:29.625
-Oh <i>Dio mio.</i>
-Sorry. sorry.

300
00:26:29.708 --> 00:26:31.208
-He'll be fine.

301
00:26:31.291 --> 00:26:34.541
-Curse you. Geppetto!
- The Lord will punish him!

302
00:26:34.625 --> 00:26:36.708
-Get out!

303
00:26:42.625 --> 00:26:45.166
-Stop fidgeting. please.
-Hello!

304
00:26:51.208 --> 00:26:53.791
Carlo never acted like this.

305
00:26:53.875 --> 00:26:56.958
Papa. why did my nose grow today?

306
00:26:58.458 --> 00:27:00.250
You lied. Pinocchio.

307
00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:05.250
and a lie is plain to see
as your nose and--

308
00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:08.375
And the more you lie. the more it grows.

309
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.083
-Is that it?
-That…

310
00:27:11.166 --> 00:27:13.666
-Yes. that's it.

311
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:28.166
-There you go.
-Chocolate.

312
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.000
-Thank you. Geppetto.

313
00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:32.333
We appreciate your hospitality.

314
00:27:32.416 --> 00:27:34.750
Candlewick. go sit by the fire.

315
00:27:35.333 --> 00:27:40.000
We are here to talk about
the incident at the church today.

316
00:27:40.958 --> 00:27:44.250
The community was startled
by your creation.

317
00:27:44.333 --> 00:27:45.666
As Podesta.

318
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:50.458
I must ensure that this puppet of yours
poses no threat to our community.

319
00:27:50.541 --> 00:27:52.583
Oh. no. no. nothing like that.

320
00:27:52.666 --> 00:27:54.625
Oh! Is that

321
00:27:55.625 --> 00:27:56.958
hot chocolate?

322
00:27:57.625 --> 00:28:00.416
You're a puppet!
You've never eaten anything in your life!

323
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.375
Oh! Oh. that must be why I'm so hungry!

324
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.333
Oh. I'm starving. Papa.
I'm starving to death!

325
00:28:08.416 --> 00:28:09.458
You are not!

326
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:13.291
Now go sit by the fire
and let me talk to our guests.

327
00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:16.000
But I don't want to! I want hot chocolate!

328
00:28:16.083 --> 00:28:19.083
-Please. Papa. Please! Please! Please!
-There. there now.

329
00:28:19.166 --> 00:28:20.208
Here you go.

330
00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:23.541
Oh boy! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

331
00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:27.833
Yes. Yes. Pinocchio.
Go… Go warm your feet by the fire.

332
00:28:27.916 --> 00:28:29.375
Obey your papa.

333
00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:32.916
Oh yes. I will obey if I get chocolate.

334
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.041
Oh boy. oh boy. oh boy!

335
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:38.791
He really is a charming boy.

336
00:28:38.875 --> 00:28:43.333
Podesta watches over the town's
moral well-being. you understand?

337
00:28:43.833 --> 00:28:46.208
His authority cannot be questioned--

338
00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:48.625
That's right!
And I won't be mocked!

339
00:28:48.708 --> 00:28:52.000
I will do just as you wish.
You have my word.

340
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.916
-So. what about this wooden boy?
-Ah.

341
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.458
Will you let him run wild
through town all day?

342
00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:02.250
Oh. no. no. no. no. no.
I'll keep him locked up!

343
00:29:02.333 --> 00:29:03.458
Right here in the house.

344
00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:05.166
I won't be locked up.

345
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:07.666
I'll smash the windows out. I will.

346
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.458
This abnormal boy lacks discipline.

347
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:16.166
But he seems strong. sturdy.
made of good Italian pine.

348
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.625
-Oh. very good pine. yes.

349
00:29:18.708 --> 00:29:22.125
Not perfect. you see.
but. uh. he means well.

350
00:29:22.666 --> 00:29:26.583
Hey. Try to get closer to the fire
to get warm.

351
00:29:26.666 --> 00:29:27.958
Son. come here.

352
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.250
Look at my boy. Candlewick.

353
00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:37.250
Yes. Yes.

354
00:29:37.333 --> 00:29:38.666
A model fascist youth.

355
00:29:39.166 --> 00:29:40.583
Proud and brave.

356
00:29:41.083 --> 00:29:43.166
Virile. like his father.

357
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:47.333
And his teeth. perfect teeth.
And no sign of jaundice.

358
00:29:47.416 --> 00:29:49.041
Papa? Papa!

359
00:29:49.125 --> 00:29:51.750
My feet feel hot. like chocolate.

360
00:29:51.833 --> 00:29:52.750
Look!

361
00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:55.250
Ah! What?!

362
00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:58.208
Fire! My house is on fire!

363
00:29:58.291 --> 00:30:01.750
-Yes! Look at me!

364
00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:06.166
Look! I'm on fire! Yay!

365
00:30:08.291 --> 00:30:12.916
Aw. Look what you did. Papa.
You've ruined the nice light on my feet.

366
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.708
This is what you get
with an undisciplined mind.

367
00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:17.875
You must send this child to school.

368
00:30:18.375 --> 00:30:21.041
To school? Pinocchio?

369
00:30:21.125 --> 00:30:23.250
Yes. Tomorrow.

370
00:30:26.333 --> 00:30:28.291
School.

371
00:30:34.708 --> 00:30:37.208
Oh. what a day. What a day.

372
00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:39.958
Oh. what a day. What a day.

373
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.833
Time for bed.

374
00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:53.375
You know. Papa. I like my old legs.
And I like them on fire.

375
00:30:53.458 --> 00:30:55.541
Pinocchio. if you go to sleep.

376
00:30:55.625 --> 00:30:58.583
I'll make you a new pair of legs
in the morning.

377
00:30:58.666 --> 00:31:00.375
Just like the old ones?

378
00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:03.166
Better than the old ones.

379
00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:07.208
Better? Can I have cricket legs. Papa?
Can you make me four of them?

380
00:31:07.291 --> 00:31:10.041
No. no. no. no. No. just two.

381
00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:12.333
Two will do.

382
00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:16.250
Good night. Papa.

383
00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:18.791
Good night. my…

384
00:31:19.708 --> 00:31:22.750
Good night. Pinocchio.

385
00:31:27.083 --> 00:31:28.333
Sebastian?

386
00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:34.625
Yes. Pinocchio?

387
00:31:36.916 --> 00:31:38.041
Who's Carlo?

388
00:31:40.541 --> 00:31:41.916
Carlo was a boy.

389
00:31:42.875 --> 00:31:45.041
Geppetto lost him many years ago.

390
00:31:45.625 --> 00:31:50.500
Where did he put him?
How can you lose a whole person?

391
00:31:50.583 --> 00:31:53.916
I mean. he… he died. Pinocchio.

392
00:31:54.583 --> 00:31:55.916
He's no longer alive.

393
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.375
Is that a bad thing?

394
00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:03.041
Yes. It's a great burden
for a father to lose a child so young.

395
00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:06.458
What's a burden?

396
00:32:08.416 --> 00:32:12.041
It's something painful you must carry

397
00:32:13.375 --> 00:32:15.791
even though it hurts you very much.

398
00:32:25.666 --> 00:32:27.583
<i>I wrote a lot that night.</i>

399
00:32:27.666 --> 00:32:29.583
<i>I had so much to say.</i>

400
00:32:29.666 --> 00:32:32.041
<i>Not about my own life. for a change.</i>

401
00:32:32.791 --> 00:32:36.041
<i>but about imperfect fathers</i>
<i>and imperfect sons.</i>

402
00:32:36.125 --> 00:32:38.541
<i>And about loss and love.</i>

403
00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:39.666
Hmm.

404
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.791
<i>And for that one evening.</i>
<i>at least.</i>

405
00:32:41.875 --> 00:32:46.083
<i>we were. all of us. blissfully oblivious.</i>

406
00:32:46.791 --> 00:32:48.375
You were right. Papa!

407
00:32:48.458 --> 00:32:52.125
These legs are much. much. much.
<i>much</i> better than the old ones!

408
00:32:53.708 --> 00:32:58.083
Ha! Look at me! I can walk backwards. Hup!

409
00:32:58.166 --> 00:32:59.916
And… And jump forwards!

410
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.833
Hup!

411
00:33:00.916 --> 00:33:03.625
-I couldn't do it before!
-Huh?

412
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:10.958
Ooh. Papa! Can you see this?
He looks just like me.

413
00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.708
What is that?

414
00:33:20.041 --> 00:33:22.500
Pinocchio! Come on.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

415
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:27.291
Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh boy!
I love these new legs. Papa.

416
00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:30.250
-Can we go to the carnival?
-Hmm.

417
00:33:30.333 --> 00:33:32.583
Perhaps. Pinocchio. Perhaps.

418
00:33:33.458 --> 00:33:35.833
Right now we have work to do.

419
00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:38.708
-Work? I love work!
-Hmm.

420
00:33:38.791 --> 00:33:40.750
Papa. what is work?

421
00:33:40.833 --> 00:33:45.000
Oh. Pinocchio. please.
No more questions.

422
00:33:45.083 --> 00:33:46.083
Huh.

423
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:02.375
-Stupid monkey!

424
00:34:03.875 --> 00:34:05.125
-Whoa!

425
00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:24.791
I'm coming!

426
00:34:26.791 --> 00:34:29.791
What is it? What are you doing here?

427
00:34:29.875 --> 00:34:31.416
Ah!

428
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.125
I told you to put up posters
and draw big crowds.

429
00:34:34.208 --> 00:34:36.750
This carnival is going to pot! And you?!

430
00:34:36.833 --> 00:34:40.458
Can you not see
how desperate the situation is?

431
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:45.916
A what?

432
00:34:48.541 --> 00:34:52.208
A living puppet? Are you absolutely sure?

433
00:34:56.083 --> 00:34:58.333
This could get us to the top again!

434
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.583
This could make us kings again!

435
00:35:36.375 --> 00:35:39.958
-Hey!

436
00:36:15.125 --> 00:36:17.625
-Now let it down.

437
00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:21.833
More. That's it. That's it.

438
00:36:21.916 --> 00:36:24.291
Just a little more. Stop.

439
00:36:26.833 --> 00:36:27.916
There we go.

440
00:36:31.875 --> 00:36:34.666
Very good. child. Very good.

441
00:36:35.208 --> 00:36:38.458
Papa. there's something
I don't understand.

442
00:36:38.541 --> 00:36:40.125
What is it. Pinocchio?

443
00:36:40.916 --> 00:36:42.500
Everybody likes <i>him</i>.

444
00:36:43.125 --> 00:36:44.125
Who?

445
00:36:44.208 --> 00:36:45.041
Him.

446
00:36:45.666 --> 00:36:47.666
-Huh?
-They were all singing to him.

447
00:36:48.666 --> 00:36:50.375
He's made of wood too.

448
00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:52.708
Why do they like <i>him</i> and not me?

449
00:36:55.416 --> 00:36:57.166
Come here. Pinocchio.

450
00:37:01.083 --> 00:37:05.458
People are sometimes
afraid of things they don't know.

451
00:37:05.541 --> 00:37:12.125
but they'll get to know you
and like you. and for that. uh…

452
00:37:13.875 --> 00:37:15.291
Are you ready for school?

453
00:37:17.458 --> 00:37:20.291
Then I have something
I'd like to give you.

454
00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:22.458
Ta-da!

455
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:26.041
I love it. Papa!

456
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:28.541
I love it! I love it! I love it!

457
00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:33.041
What is it?

458
00:37:35.375 --> 00:37:36.708
It is a schoolbook.

459
00:37:37.458 --> 00:37:40.375
A very special schoolbook.

460
00:37:40.875 --> 00:37:44.458
One which belonged to a very special boy.

461
00:37:45.083 --> 00:37:48.291
Carlo. the boy you lost?

462
00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:49.333
Uh-huh.

463
00:37:49.833 --> 00:37:51.625
Was he a very good boy. Papa?

464
00:37:52.125 --> 00:37:53.166
Yes. he was.

465
00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.083
And you loved him very much?

466
00:37:58.750 --> 00:37:59.666
I did.

467
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.416
I… I do.

468
00:38:04.916 --> 00:38:07.250
Then I will be just like Carlo!

469
00:38:07.333 --> 00:38:11.416
I will obey and go to school.
and I'll be the very. very best

470
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.458
at… whatever they do there.

471
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.500
I'll make you proud!

472
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.833
Hup! Hup!

473
00:38:24.916 --> 00:38:26.208
Hup! Hup!

474
00:38:28.541 --> 00:38:29.833
He exists!

475
00:38:29.916 --> 00:38:34.000
Oh. this dream. this wonder exists!

476
00:38:34.083 --> 00:38:38.250
-You beautiful. brilliant baboon!

477
00:38:39.166 --> 00:38:40.125
I must have him.

478
00:38:40.875 --> 00:38:43.083
-Whoa!

479
00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:47.333
Hup!

480
00:38:47.416 --> 00:38:50.250
School! Oh boy. oh boy. oh boy!

481
00:38:50.916 --> 00:38:54.875
-What do you learn in school. Mr. Cricket?
-You'll learn reading and writing.

482
00:38:54.958 --> 00:38:57.458
You learn the multiplication tables!

483
00:38:57.541 --> 00:39:00.333
What's the <i>mulplitication</i> tables?

484
00:39:00.416 --> 00:39:04.708
Well. say you have four carts.
each with. uh. 27 apples.

485
00:39:04.791 --> 00:39:09.000
I don't care what the table says.
I have no apples. and I refuse to lie!

486
00:39:09.083 --> 00:39:10.541
Oh. no. It's just math!

487
00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:14.583
So you multiply the four and the seven…
four past seven? And you get--

488
00:39:14.666 --> 00:39:16.166
I get confused.

489
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:19.041
I don't think
I like school anymore. Sebastian.

490
00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:21.458
Ah! We have found him!

491
00:39:21.541 --> 00:39:24.291
Look. Spazzatura! Our miracle!

492
00:39:24.375 --> 00:39:26.375
-Our sensation!
-Hey. watch it!

493
00:39:26.458 --> 00:39:28.125
Our star!

494
00:39:28.708 --> 00:39:29.708
Who? Me?

495
00:39:29.791 --> 00:39:31.291
Yes. <i>mon étoile</i>!

496
00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:34.625
I am Count Volpe! You have been chosen!

497
00:39:34.708 --> 00:39:38.458
Come partake in
the fun. fanciful. carefree carnival life

498
00:39:38.541 --> 00:39:42.291
as the star of my puppet show!

499
00:39:42.375 --> 00:39:44.000
Don't listen to him. Pinocchio!

500
00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:46.791
You promised your papa
you would go to school!

501
00:39:46.875 --> 00:39:50.333
Oh. yeah.
I promised my papa I'd go to school.

502
00:39:50.416 --> 00:39:53.250
See? He gave me Carlo's book.

503
00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:56.791
Carlo's book? Yes! Yes!

504
00:39:56.875 --> 00:39:59.208
A classical. canonical work.

505
00:39:59.291 --> 00:40:01.666
I can see
you're intrinsically an intellectual!

506
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:06.166
But then now. book learning cannot compare
to witnessing the wide world

507
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:11.041
with one's own eyes
from atop the glorious stage.

508
00:40:11.125 --> 00:40:13.000
-Wow.

509
00:40:13.666 --> 00:40:17.583
You shall see all
of the nations of the earth for yourself

510
00:40:17.666 --> 00:40:20.333
as they bow at your feet.

511
00:40:20.416 --> 00:40:22.416
My brand-new feet!

512
00:40:23.041 --> 00:40:24.958
No! No. wait!

513
00:40:25.041 --> 00:40:26.833
You have to go to school!

514
00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:29.916
Oh. can we do it tomorrow?

515
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.375
Regretfully. no.

516
00:40:32.458 --> 00:40:34.125
For today's the only day

517
00:40:34.208 --> 00:40:37.625
that our cacophonous carnival
will visit your vicinity.

518
00:40:37.708 --> 00:40:41.125
but if you must go to school.
then you must go to school.

519
00:40:41.208 --> 00:40:43.250
Come. Spazzatura.

520
00:40:43.333 --> 00:40:44.916
We must find someone else

521
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.541
to eat all our ice cream
and popcorn and hot chocolate.

522
00:40:48.625 --> 00:40:51.000
-Hot chocolate?
-Oh no.

523
00:40:51.083 --> 00:40:52.000
Yes. of course!

524
00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:55.541
All the hot chocolate you can drink
and all the games you can play.

525
00:40:55.625 --> 00:40:57.416
Oh boy. oh boy!

526
00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.625
Maybe it'll be okay
if I'm a little bit late for school?

527
00:41:01.708 --> 00:41:04.916
Yeah. perfectly fine.
No one will even notice.

528
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.250
Don't listen to him. Pinocchio!

529
00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:10.500
Ah. we have
one last detail to take care of.

530
00:41:11.208 --> 00:41:12.166
Whoa!

531
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.375
Sign here. here. and here. Need a pen?

532
00:41:16.125 --> 00:41:18.958
-No. Pinocchio! Don't!

533
00:41:22.916 --> 00:41:24.041
Like this?

534
00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:30.583
Perfect! I will now make you
burn bright like a star!

535
00:41:30.666 --> 00:41:32.583
Follow me. my boy!

536
00:41:39.458 --> 00:41:40.750
Oh. the pain.

537
00:41:40.833 --> 00:41:43.291
Life is such hideous pain.

538
00:41:47.291 --> 00:41:50.666
Master Geppetto.
would you mind coming down?

539
00:41:59.458 --> 00:42:02.000
Oh. at last!

540
00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:05.208
Our savior is restored.

541
00:42:18.208 --> 00:42:20.791
Oh. I'm… I'm so sorry.

542
00:42:23.833 --> 00:42:26.875
Your boy didn't show up at school today.

543
00:42:28.125 --> 00:42:31.333
But he left this morning.
I… I sent him there.

544
00:42:31.416 --> 00:42:34.291
Obviously. the puppet
is quite a dissident.

545
00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:36.875
An independent thinker. I'd say.

546
00:42:36.958 --> 00:42:40.000
-Uh. uh. uh. yes.
-You better look for him.

547
00:42:40.083 --> 00:42:44.625
I trust we will see
the wooden boy tomorrow at school.

548
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.083
Tomorrow?
Oh. yes. Yes. of course.

549
00:42:51.541 --> 00:42:52.833
Ah!

550
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.208
Boy. the carnival sure is grand.

551
00:42:56.291 --> 00:42:59.208
How about some more popcorn?

552
00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:03.250
Oh. I couldn't eat
another bite. Mr. Diavolo.

553
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.458
I better get going to school. I guess.

554
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:11.708
-Stay a while. Pinocchio.

555
00:43:11.791 --> 00:43:15.333
I am sorry to keep you waiting.
my little puppet.

556
00:43:15.916 --> 00:43:19.083
I don't like being called a puppet.

557
00:43:19.166 --> 00:43:22.958
My boy. Puppets are <i>le meilleur qui soit!</i>

558
00:43:23.041 --> 00:43:25.333
The tops! Lift your arm.

559
00:43:25.416 --> 00:43:28.375
Puppets are well respected
in every station of life.

560
00:43:28.458 --> 00:43:30.875
But I thought it was best
to be a normal boy.

561
00:43:30.958 --> 00:43:34.625
Oh. no. no. no. People love puppets.

562
00:43:34.708 --> 00:43:37.833
Like Il Diavolo. Columbina. Punchinello.

563
00:43:37.916 --> 00:43:41.708
Of course. there's but one puppet
who is king of them all!

564
00:43:41.791 --> 00:43:44.125
Oh boy. I'd like to meet that guy.

565
00:43:44.208 --> 00:43:48.041
Pinocchio!

566
00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:49.916
Wait. That's me!

567
00:43:50.458 --> 00:43:53.625
That's right. You are a wonder! A miracle.

568
00:43:53.708 --> 00:43:55.166
They'll love you!

569
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.083
Who?

570
00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:57.333
<i>Les Idiots!</i>

571
00:43:57.416 --> 00:43:59.583
The wonderful children of the world!

572
00:43:59.666 --> 00:44:03.125
Lift your leg. Everyone shall love you
and call your name.

573
00:44:03.208 --> 00:44:07.916
-Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

574
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.583
Pinocchio. the living puppet!

575
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.750
Oh.

576
00:44:24.333 --> 00:44:25.833
A one and a two and…

577
00:44:32.875 --> 00:44:36.791
<i>
-Yeah!</i>

578
00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:50.500
-Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

579
00:44:55.958 --> 00:44:57.541
Pinocchio!

580
00:45:00.166 --> 00:45:01.041
No.

581
00:45:01.916 --> 00:45:03.583
Carlo's book.

582
00:45:06.375 --> 00:45:07.208
What?

583
00:45:08.541 --> 00:45:10.208
Over there.

584
00:45:14.916 --> 00:45:19.375
That song. How could he know that song?

585
00:45:23.166 --> 00:45:25.916
One nightmare after another.

586
00:45:39.208 --> 00:45:41.250
Yay! Pinocchio!

587
00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:42.250
Thank you!

588
00:45:42.333 --> 00:45:45.333
And all those treats are
for sale at the carnival.

589
00:45:45.416 --> 00:45:46.250
Thank you!

590
00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:49.083
Pinocchio? What's all this?

591
00:45:50.208 --> 00:45:51.291
What are you doing?

592
00:45:51.375 --> 00:45:52.541
Papa!

593
00:45:52.625 --> 00:45:55.791
I'm a star. Papa! A star!

594
00:45:55.875 --> 00:45:58.125
-They love me! They accept me!
-Oh. what are you--

595
00:45:58.208 --> 00:46:02.333
Enough of this nonsense.
You were supposed to be at school.

596
00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.250
And how do you know that song anyway?

597
00:46:07.791 --> 00:46:09.916
You simian simpleton!

598
00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:12.833
-My star!

599
00:46:12.916 --> 00:46:15.583
Where is my star?

600
00:46:16.291 --> 00:46:18.500
-Thank you. Thank you.

601
00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:19.958
Oh. you're very kind.

602
00:46:20.041 --> 00:46:25.916
You ruined Carlo's book.
and you didn't go to school! Why?

603
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.458
You promised me
you would behave like… like… like--

604
00:46:29.541 --> 00:46:30.541
Carlo.

605
00:46:32.833 --> 00:46:33.916
Yes.

606
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.250
I was going to. Papa. but… but…

607
00:46:36.958 --> 00:46:38.875
Yes. Pinocchio. What?

608
00:46:39.583 --> 00:46:42.000
Ten bandits came out
of the bushes and took--

609
00:46:43.541 --> 00:46:46.875
…out of the bushes.
and they took the book.

610
00:46:46.958 --> 00:46:48.750
Oh. I… I see.

611
00:46:48.833 --> 00:46:51.125
And then what happened?

612
00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:54.000
They had an axe.
and they wanted chocolate.

613
00:46:54.083 --> 00:46:55.250
Hot chocolate!

614
00:46:55.333 --> 00:46:58.708
Pinocchio. you shouldn't lie to me.

615
00:46:58.791 --> 00:47:00.166
I am your papa!

616
00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.708
-But I'm telling the truth!

617
00:47:03.208 --> 00:47:05.458
Then why is your nose growing?

618
00:47:05.541 --> 00:47:07.666
-It's not!

619
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.791
Lies. lies. and more lies!

620
00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:13.458
I am not lying!

621
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.125
Will you look at you?

622
00:47:22.583 --> 00:47:23.625
Go away!

623
00:47:23.708 --> 00:47:25.583
This is not a spectacle!

624
00:47:26.625 --> 00:47:28.166
But it is!

625
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:30.750
Unhand my <i>carissimo</i>. you carousing…

626
00:47:32.625 --> 00:47:34.083
kleptomaniac!

627
00:47:34.166 --> 00:47:35.791
Do not touch him!

628
00:47:36.833 --> 00:47:38.041
I made him!

629
00:47:38.125 --> 00:47:39.750
And I discovered him!

630
00:47:39.833 --> 00:47:43.500
-He's not your puppet. He's mine!
-Oh!

631
00:47:43.583 --> 00:47:44.958
Perhaps we should--

632
00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:46.500
Oh. he is neither!

633
00:47:46.583 --> 00:47:50.583
-He's an actor. My actor.

634
00:47:51.291 --> 00:47:52.333
Give him to me!

635
00:47:52.416 --> 00:47:54.208
Never!

636
00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:57.916
-Oh dear.

637
00:48:00.208 --> 00:48:02.916
That was so much fun. Papa!

638
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.125
-No!

639
00:48:11.041 --> 00:48:13.000
No…

640
00:48:17.333 --> 00:48:18.333
Pinocchio.

641
00:48:18.416 --> 00:48:20.250
He came out of nowhere!

642
00:48:20.333 --> 00:48:22.625
That's what happens
when you let your children run wild!

643
00:48:22.708 --> 00:48:24.125
<i>Pinocchio was dead.</i>

644
00:48:24.208 --> 00:48:27.208
<i>That much was apparent</i>
<i>to any astute observer.</i>

645
00:48:28.416 --> 00:48:32.083
<i>But little did I know</i>
<i>that death was not the end.</i>

646
00:48:44.958 --> 00:48:46.916
-Did you hear that?
-Who's there?

647
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.958
-I thought he was dead.
-He is dead. I saw the paperwork myself.

648
00:48:51.041 --> 00:48:53.416
-Hello?

649
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.416
All right. So. where were we?

650
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:06.375
Whose deal?

651
00:49:06.458 --> 00:49:07.291
Mine. right?

652
00:49:07.791 --> 00:49:09.541
All right. boys. ante up.

653
00:49:09.625 --> 00:49:12.666
-What's the limit again?
-Twenty's the limit. ya mook.

654
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:14.583
You got something under there. don't ya?

655
00:49:14.666 --> 00:49:17.458
Probably has a <i>leibedik</i> six.

656
00:49:17.541 --> 00:49:20.291
-Very funny.
-Are you playing a game?

657
00:49:21.083 --> 00:49:25.833
-Flush!
-I wanna play! Please. please. can I play?

658
00:49:25.916 --> 00:49:28.708
What part of dead
don't you understand. <i>schmendrick</i>?

659
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:32.291
-It's boring in there. I hate being dead.

660
00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:34.291
Uh-oh. now you did it.

661
00:49:34.375 --> 00:49:35.250
What's that?

662
00:49:35.333 --> 00:49:36.750
Processing.

663
00:49:36.833 --> 00:49:38.958
Go see the boss. kid.

664
00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:40.916
Through there.

665
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.083
-You'll see her.

666
00:49:43.583 --> 00:49:48.125
-Give me a freakin' ace. please.

667
00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:05.416
Hello? Hello?

668
00:50:08.958 --> 00:50:10.291
Who are you?

669
00:50:11.166 --> 00:50:14.083
I feel as though you've been here before.

670
00:50:14.166 --> 00:50:16.791
I am Pinocchio. I'm a boy.

671
00:50:16.875 --> 00:50:19.833
And I think I'm… dead.

672
00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:22.875
Ah. yes. I see.

673
00:50:24.333 --> 00:50:28.708
The wooden boy with the borrowed soul.

674
00:50:29.458 --> 00:50:31.291
My sister's folly.

675
00:50:31.375 --> 00:50:33.750
The sentimental fool.

676
00:50:34.541 --> 00:50:39.875
She gave you life. Pinocchio.
when you were not supposed to have it.

677
00:50:39.958 --> 00:50:43.375
No more than a chair or a table should.

678
00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:48.916
As a result. you cannot truly. truly die.

679
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:51.125
Oh boy. oh boy!

680
00:50:51.208 --> 00:50:52.958
And… And that's good. right?

681
00:50:53.041 --> 00:50:55.166
Well. it means that you are not.

682
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:59.625
nor will you ever be.
a real boy like Carlo.

683
00:51:01.375 --> 00:51:05.333
The one thing that makes human life
precious and meaningful. you see.

684
00:51:06.208 --> 00:51:07.875
is how brief it is.

685
00:51:08.833 --> 00:51:09.666
Oh.

686
00:51:10.958 --> 00:51:14.458
Don't get me wrong. you will die

687
00:51:14.541 --> 00:51:17.166
many. many times.

688
00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.125
This being one of them.

689
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.666
But they are not real deaths.

690
00:51:24.666 --> 00:51:27.000
Just waiting periods.

691
00:51:28.291 --> 00:51:30.166
There are rules. you see.

692
00:51:31.916 --> 00:51:35.166
Despite my sister's disregard for them.

693
00:51:36.625 --> 00:51:40.125
We will both have to wait
for the sand to run out.

694
00:51:41.333 --> 00:51:46.750
You will stay here with me
a little longer each time you cross

695
00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:49.041
until the end of time.

696
00:51:51.416 --> 00:51:54.125
And then. after that sand runs out?

697
00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:58.041
I will simply send you back
every time.

698
00:51:58.625 --> 00:51:59.916
I see.

699
00:52:00.416 --> 00:52:04.416
Well. in that case.
I'd like to ask you one thing.

700
00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:09.083
See you next time.

701
00:52:15.375 --> 00:52:16.208
No.

702
00:52:19.458 --> 00:52:20.291
No.

703
00:52:20.875 --> 00:52:22.625
Ah. Pinocchio.

704
00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:27.875
<i>Niente</i>. There's not much we can do.

705
00:52:27.958 --> 00:52:30.583
I'm afraid the body is rigid.

706
00:52:30.666 --> 00:52:33.833
Well. he's always been rigid.
He's made of wood.

707
00:52:33.916 --> 00:52:36.708
Even if he's dead. I could still book him.

708
00:52:36.791 --> 00:52:39.041
How dare you. sir!

709
00:52:39.125 --> 00:52:40.708
Show some respect.

710
00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:45.208
You show respect to me
and my projected quarterly earnings!

711
00:52:45.291 --> 00:52:46.666
Gentlemen. please.

712
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:49.291
This is no time for your petty grievances.

713
00:52:52.083 --> 00:52:54.250
How do you intend
to dispose of the dead body?

714
00:52:54.333 --> 00:52:56.041
-A dead body? Where?

715
00:52:57.291 --> 00:52:59.583
Pinocchio! You're alive!

716
00:52:59.666 --> 00:53:00.791
He is immortal!

717
00:53:00.875 --> 00:53:02.791
Long live the arts!

718
00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:05.041
It's a miracle.

719
00:53:07.458 --> 00:53:09.291
Take it easy. my child.

720
00:53:10.083 --> 00:53:11.166
Lean on me.

721
00:53:11.250 --> 00:53:13.041
We're going home.

722
00:53:13.125 --> 00:53:15.958
-Uh. uh. uh. Wait a moment.

723
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:17.833
I have a legally binding contract.

724
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:22.208
Signed by both artist and management.

725
00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:28.333
He either performs.
or you owe me ten million lire!

726
00:53:28.958 --> 00:53:30.333
Well. that's ridiculous.

727
00:53:30.416 --> 00:53:32.208
It's just a smiling sun.

728
00:53:32.291 --> 00:53:34.666
It's still his signature. is it not?

729
00:53:35.291 --> 00:53:36.375
I drew that.

730
00:53:36.458 --> 00:53:37.333
Ha ha!

731
00:53:37.833 --> 00:53:40.458
I demand full restitution before the law.

732
00:53:40.541 --> 00:53:44.250
including transportation.
transmutation. all the future represe--

733
00:53:44.333 --> 00:53:46.416
Our country comes first.

734
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.208
This boy cannot be killed.

735
00:53:48.708 --> 00:53:50.291
-He's the ideal soldier.
-Hmm?

736
00:53:50.375 --> 00:53:53.333
He must be drafted
into the youth camps by law.

737
00:53:54.125 --> 00:53:55.875
You will learn to fight.

738
00:53:55.958 --> 00:53:59.083
and fire a weapon.
and be a real Italian boy.

739
00:53:59.166 --> 00:54:01.500
Now we… we must go.

740
00:54:01.583 --> 00:54:03.541
We truly must go.

741
00:54:03.625 --> 00:54:07.250
We will all speak later. I am sure.

742
00:54:07.333 --> 00:54:10.666
Not to me. sir. Speak to my lawyers!

743
00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:16.166
What… What a day. What a day!

744
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:17.375
A fun day!

745
00:54:17.875 --> 00:54:19.458
What will we do?

746
00:54:19.541 --> 00:54:20.875
Oh. don't worry. Papa.

747
00:54:20.958 --> 00:54:23.333
I'll go to war. It sounds quite fun.

748
00:54:23.416 --> 00:54:27.166
I can learn to fight
and fire a weapon and march like the--

749
00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:28.750
No. Pinocchio.

750
00:54:28.833 --> 00:54:31.708
War is not fun!

751
00:54:31.791 --> 00:54:34.083
War is not good. War…

752
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:38.750
War took Carlo away from me.

753
00:54:39.416 --> 00:54:40.708
Then I simply won't go.

754
00:54:40.791 --> 00:54:43.583
But you have to go now. It's the law.

755
00:54:43.666 --> 00:54:45.458
Even when it's something bad?

756
00:54:45.541 --> 00:54:50.541
Yes. we all have to obey the law
whether we like it or not.

757
00:54:51.041 --> 00:54:51.875
Why?

758
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:57.416
I don't have time or patience enough
to explain that to you. I… I…

759
00:54:58.208 --> 00:55:00.791
I owe that man a fortune.

760
00:55:00.875 --> 00:55:07.208
And you… you will be taken far away
and recruited into military youth camp.

761
00:55:07.291 --> 00:55:10.958
And now… now look
what you've turned me into.

762
00:55:11.916 --> 00:55:14.833
I made you to be like Carlo.

763
00:55:14.916 --> 00:55:17.416
Why can't you be more like Carlo?

764
00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.250
Because I'm not Carlo.

765
00:55:19.333 --> 00:55:21.291
I don't wanna be like Carlo.

766
00:55:21.375 --> 00:55:22.833
-Carlo is--
-Enough!

767
00:55:24.875 --> 00:55:28.166
You are such a burden.

768
00:55:35.083 --> 00:55:35.958
Oh.

769
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.125
His nose didn't grow.

770
00:55:56.375 --> 00:55:57.666
What's that?

771
00:55:57.750 --> 00:56:01.333
When he called me a burden.
his nose didn't grow.

772
00:56:02.791 --> 00:56:04.416
That's how he really feels.

773
00:56:06.291 --> 00:56:08.000
I don't want to be a burden.

774
00:56:08.833 --> 00:56:12.333
I don't want to hurt Papa
and make him want to yell at me like that.

775
00:56:13.541 --> 00:56:14.625
Oh. Pinocchio.

776
00:56:15.875 --> 00:56:19.750
Sometimes fathers feel despair
like everybody else.

777
00:56:20.333 --> 00:56:21.666
And they say things.

778
00:56:22.333 --> 00:56:25.166
things they only think they mean
in the moment.

779
00:56:25.833 --> 00:56:27.875
But with time. they learn that…

780
00:56:29.333 --> 00:56:31.625
well. that they
never really meant it at all.

781
00:56:33.166 --> 00:56:34.250
Do you understand?

782
00:56:39.666 --> 00:56:42.791
Hey. Hey. where are you going?

783
00:56:42.875 --> 00:56:44.541
I've got a plan.

784
00:56:44.625 --> 00:56:48.208
-Pinocchio. wha… what are you doing?
-You'll see!

785
00:56:48.291 --> 00:56:49.958
I'm going to the carnival.

786
00:56:50.791 --> 00:56:54.166
That way. I can help Papa.
and I won't go to war.

787
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:57.250
I'll leave him a note
explaining everything.

788
00:56:59.166 --> 00:57:01.125
No. Pinocchio. don't do this.

789
00:57:02.916 --> 00:57:04.208
Oh. that's--

790
00:57:05.208 --> 00:57:06.708
No! No!

791
00:57:06.791 --> 00:57:07.708
Hmm.

792
00:57:08.583 --> 00:57:10.375
No! No. don't do this!

793
00:57:11.083 --> 00:57:13.625
You tell him that I will send him money.

794
00:57:14.541 --> 00:57:16.083
And tell him I love him.

795
00:57:16.875 --> 00:57:18.958
And I won't be a burden anymore.

796
00:57:23.625 --> 00:57:25.666
No!

797
00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:53.208
-Huh?

798
00:57:53.916 --> 00:57:55.416
-What is it?

799
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:57.250
What do you want in the middle of the…

800
00:57:57.333 --> 00:57:59.958
My beloved star!

801
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:03.583
How can I be of assistance?

802
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:08.041
If I work for you. will you forget
the money you want from my papa?

803
00:58:08.625 --> 00:58:10.041
Huh?

804
00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:13.541
Oh. absolutely. my dear boy.

805
00:58:14.125 --> 00:58:17.291
And will you send him
my share of the profits?

806
00:58:17.375 --> 00:58:19.916
Clear accounting all the way.

807
00:58:20.666 --> 00:58:23.041
Fifty-fifty. right down the middle.

808
00:58:29.250 --> 00:58:31.791
-Oh.

809
00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:34.750
-Everybody up!

810
00:58:37.125 --> 00:58:38.833
We're leaving!

811
00:59:07.833 --> 00:59:08.708
Oh.

812
00:59:10.416 --> 00:59:11.791
The pain.

813
00:59:16.583 --> 00:59:18.958
Pinocchio. Son.

814
00:59:19.958 --> 00:59:22.125
I just wanted to say…

815
00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:27.208
Pinocchio!

816
00:59:35.166 --> 00:59:36.208
Oh!

817
00:59:37.291 --> 00:59:38.541
Little cricket.

818
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.333
He's gone! To the carnival!

819
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:53.375
Pinocchio!

820
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:56.958
Pinocchio!

821
00:59:58.583 --> 00:59:59.708
Pinocchio!

822
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.083
Get! Get!

823
01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:17.291
Oh.

824
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.125
How will I ever find him?

825
01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:24.375
Oh. now you want to find him?

826
01:00:25.333 --> 01:00:28.833
After all the things you said.
After you called him a burden!

827
01:00:28.916 --> 01:00:30.166
A burden?!

828
01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:32.291
Why are you so blind?

829
01:00:32.375 --> 01:00:34.500
So absolutely blind!

830
01:00:34.583 --> 01:00:35.916
The boy loves you.

831
01:00:37.291 --> 01:00:41.125
He has much to learn.
but he loves you for who you are.

832
01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:43.708
Would it kill you to do as much for him?

833
01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:47.000
You should start acting like a father.
A real father!

834
01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:51.416
Not an old stubborn goat who's so busy
moaning and crying about his losses…

835
01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.041
"Me. me. me. poor me!"

836
01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:57.291
…that he cannot see
the love he actually has!

837
01:00:57.375 --> 01:00:59.625
I may be a bug. sir.

838
01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:01.958
but I have a thing or two
to teach you about…

839
01:01:02.041 --> 01:01:04.291
Hey! Where are you going?

840
01:01:04.375 --> 01:01:06.208
After my son!

841
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:09.416
Excuse… If I may.
per… perhaps we should… Wait!

842
01:01:14.041 --> 01:01:16.125
-Wait! Wait! Wait!

843
01:03:01.666 --> 01:03:02.791
Ah!

844
01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:41.208
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

845
01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:46.250
<i>Viva Benito Mussolini. nostro duce!</i>

846
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.875
<i>Viva! Viva! Viva!</i>

847
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.625
Just one last stop.

848
01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:14.375
Don't forget to send
my share of the money back home to Papa.

849
01:05:14.458 --> 01:05:16.750
Oh. I wouldn't dream of forgetting.

850
01:05:16.833 --> 01:05:19.125
See? Fifty-fifty…

851
01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:24.333
minus expenses.
transportation. and promotion.

852
01:05:25.125 --> 01:05:26.416
Huh?

853
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:31.375
Tomorrow we go
to a small town by the sea. Catania.

854
01:05:32.958 --> 01:05:38.416
And there we will perform
for his excellency. <i>Il Duce.</i>

855
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.083
<i>Il Dolce?</i>

856
01:05:40.166 --> 01:05:41.750
No. my brightest star.

857
01:05:41.833 --> 01:05:47.458
Our fearless leader.
<i>Il Duce</i>. Benito Mussolini!

858
01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:52.541
He heard of our act
and is coming to see us! Oh!

859
01:05:54.666 --> 01:05:56.875
He and I are very close.

860
01:05:58.291 --> 01:06:00.291
Here we are in Roma.

861
01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:02.875
That's him. back there.

862
01:06:03.916 --> 01:06:08.541
You will make me and your papa so proud.

863
01:06:08.625 --> 01:06:09.666
Proud.

864
01:06:13.875 --> 01:06:15.125
Excuse me. sir.

865
01:06:15.958 --> 01:06:19.333
Catania. Do you go there?

866
01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:21.375
Can… Can you take me there?

867
01:06:21.458 --> 01:06:22.625
Please?

868
01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:24.875
It's just across the strait.

869
01:06:26.208 --> 01:06:28.125
That's not the sea out there.

870
01:06:34.625 --> 01:06:36.750
-It's a graveyard!

871
01:06:36.833 --> 01:06:38.250
Oh dear… Oh…

872
01:06:38.333 --> 01:06:42.333
The dogfish. risen from the icy depths

873
01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:45.666
to take its tribute in blood and steel.

874
01:06:46.166 --> 01:06:50.166
A monster the size o' 20 ships.

875
01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:54.166
full of hunger and rage.

876
01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:57.791
Oh please. That's just children's stories.

877
01:06:57.875 --> 01:06:58.833
Captain.

878
01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:03.958
my son is on the other side of the gulf.

879
01:07:04.875 --> 01:07:07.750
He is performing tomorrow.

880
01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:13.000
This is all I have in the world.

881
01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:14.583
Take it. It's yours.

882
01:07:14.666 --> 01:07:17.083
I just want to see him again.

883
01:07:21.666 --> 01:07:25.041
-Step and turn. And step and turn.

884
01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:27.208
And look alive and step.

885
01:07:27.291 --> 01:07:30.166
-Step. Step.
-Can I take a moment to rest?

886
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:33.041
No. Your tempo
is getting sloppier and sloppier.

887
01:07:33.125 --> 01:07:34.958
-No rest whatsoever.

888
01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:40.750
Five minutes. please.

889
01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.166
Three minutes.

890
01:07:45.375 --> 01:07:47.000
-Ooh.

891
01:07:53.583 --> 01:07:56.291
Are you feeling okay. Pinocchio?

892
01:07:56.375 --> 01:07:57.375
We're concerned.

893
01:07:57.458 --> 01:07:59.708
You look so tired and worn out.

894
01:07:59.791 --> 01:08:01.625
You need a good long rest.

895
01:08:01.708 --> 01:08:06.208
And some trousers and another ear
wouldn't hurt either if you ask me.

896
01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:08.708
Why not go home
and visit your papa for a while?

897
01:08:08.791 --> 01:08:10.500
This is no place for you.

898
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.041
I can't.

899
01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:16.958
I have to keep working
and working and sending money.

900
01:08:17.041 --> 01:08:17.875
Yeah…

901
01:08:17.958 --> 01:08:19.125
The truth is

902
01:08:19.625 --> 01:08:21.958
Count Volpe is using you.

903
01:08:23.375 --> 01:08:26.708
He hasn't sent a penny to your father.

904
01:08:26.791 --> 01:08:28.125
What?

905
01:08:28.208 --> 01:08:31.541
He keeps all the money for himself.

906
01:08:31.625 --> 01:08:33.125
He doesn't care about you.

907
01:08:33.208 --> 01:08:34.541
You're not his favorite.

908
01:08:34.625 --> 01:08:36.666
Spazzatura is his favorite.

909
01:08:36.750 --> 01:08:39.541
He's always been. He's a genius.

910
01:08:39.625 --> 01:08:42.250
No! Count Volpe wouldn't lie to me.

911
01:08:42.333 --> 01:08:43.875
I'm… I'm his star!

912
01:08:44.916 --> 01:08:46.750
You're… You're all just jealous!

913
01:08:50.625 --> 01:08:52.666
Ugh.

914
01:09:08.291 --> 01:09:11.083
You think we will find him. Sebastian?

915
01:09:11.916 --> 01:09:13.458
My Pinocchio?

916
01:09:14.333 --> 01:09:16.750
I do. You see…

917
01:09:29.708 --> 01:09:31.041
Arrivederci!

918
01:09:47.708 --> 01:09:49.541
Ha ha! It's me!

919
01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:51.458
-Look. here he comes!
It's him! It's him!

920
01:09:51.541 --> 01:09:55.375
-It's Pinocchio! Let me talk to him.
-Thank you. Oh. you're very kind.

921
01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:57.083
Not right now. I'm sorry.

922
01:09:59.333 --> 01:10:01.416
-You worthless…

923
01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:05.541
…mangy. deranged ape!

924
01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:06.625
Hmm?

925
01:10:08.166 --> 01:10:10.125
What have you been saying to him. huh?

926
01:10:10.208 --> 01:10:14.375
On the night before the big performance.
you could cost me everything!

927
01:10:14.916 --> 01:10:19.166
-You know who's coming? You have any idea?

928
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:23.458
I found you
at the bottom of that cage in the rain.

929
01:10:23.541 --> 01:10:25.500
You were left there to die.

930
01:10:25.583 --> 01:10:28.416
Nobody wanted you. and I saved you.

931
01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:29.541
Rescued you!

932
01:10:30.041 --> 01:10:31.916
I should've let you die!

933
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:34.666
Hey! Stop that!

934
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:36.125
Don't hurt him anymore!

935
01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:41.208
This does not concern you. Pinocchio.
You're a star. Go rehearse your steps.

936
01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:42.916
I demand that you stop!

937
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.916
You said it! I am the star of this show.

938
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.541
and I won't have
my costar treated this way.

939
01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:52.083
And what's this I hear about
my papa not getting any money?

940
01:10:52.166 --> 01:10:54.833
I might just go home
right now and ask him.

941
01:10:54.916 --> 01:10:56.208
What do you think about that?

942
01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:59.208
You can perform for <i>Il Dolce</i> yourself.

943
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:06.375
I think you misunderstand
our relationship. my little fire hazard.

944
01:11:07.083 --> 01:11:08.625
I am the puppeteer.

945
01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:11.625
-Uh!
-You are the puppet.

946
01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:14.416
I am the master.

947
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.958
You are the slave!

948
01:11:16.041 --> 01:11:18.791
-And you will do as I command

949
01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:21.291
until your wooden body rots.

950
01:11:21.375 --> 01:11:23.750
and I use you to warm my furnace!

951
01:11:23.833 --> 01:11:25.416
-Oh.

952
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.166
You may have no strings.

953
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:30.375
but I control you.

954
01:11:30.458 --> 01:11:32.833
You obey me.

955
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.583
Capisce?

956
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:39.125
Spazzatura.

957
01:11:56.125 --> 01:11:59.291
A son knows when his father is alive.

958
01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:02.083
He will look for us. you'll see.

959
01:12:02.166 --> 01:12:04.500
-You have nothing to worry about.

960
01:12:04.583 --> 01:12:06.125
Easy for you to say.

961
01:12:09.333 --> 01:12:11.666
We are having dinner tonight.

962
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.875
We're so lucky!

963
01:12:46.708 --> 01:12:49.583
Oh. Your Excellency!

964
01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:53.208
I wrote this number just for you.

965
01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:55.416
I like puppets.

966
01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.333
-Hey. Spazzatura.
-Hmm?

967
01:13:00.833 --> 01:13:04.375
You know. I think we ought to make
this big showstopper extra special

968
01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:07.208
for the all-important <i>Dolce</i> tonight.

969
01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:10.333
-Huh?
-I got some real good ideas.

970
01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:13.125
I think
that will definitely work.

971
01:13:16.166 --> 01:13:19.166
<i>In bocca al lupo. </i>my puppet.

972
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:23.583
Delight the <i>Duce.</i>
and I will shower you with glory.

973
01:13:23.666 --> 01:13:27.625
Oh. we'll give him
a show he will never forget.

974
01:13:46.208 --> 01:13:48.708
-Poop?

975
01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.416
Yes. Poop. Your Excellency.

976
01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:01.958
-Poop! Poop! Poop! Poop!
-Ah!

977
01:14:20.916 --> 01:14:22.833
These puppets. I do not like.

978
01:14:23.666 --> 01:14:24.583
Shoot him!

979
01:14:26.541 --> 01:14:28.083
And burn it all down.

980
01:14:33.333 --> 01:14:35.000
Oh. hi! It's me!

981
01:14:35.083 --> 01:14:37.000
Ugh. it's him again.

982
01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:38.250
I cannot die!

983
01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:39.750
We know.

984
01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:42.000
-I can't die.

985
01:14:42.583 --> 01:14:44.083
I can't die!

986
01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:46.958
Through the door.

987
01:14:48.916 --> 01:14:50.291
Can you believe it?

988
01:14:50.375 --> 01:14:53.541
I've escaped war. bullets. fire…

989
01:14:53.625 --> 01:14:54.833
I was run over!

990
01:14:54.916 --> 01:14:57.541
I could get killed a lot!

991
01:14:57.625 --> 01:15:00.125
I'm the luckiest boy in the world.

992
01:15:00.208 --> 01:15:04.333
As I see it.
you were charged with a terrible burden.

993
01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:06.208
Huh? A burden?

994
01:15:06.916 --> 01:15:08.291
No. I'm not.

995
01:15:09.375 --> 01:15:12.083
That's a horrible thing to say to a boy.

996
01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:15.666
Life can bring great suffering.

997
01:15:16.416 --> 01:15:20.125
And eternal life
can bring eternal suffering.

998
01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.833
Aw. it's not so bad as all that.

999
01:15:23.916 --> 01:15:26.500
Yeah. I get a little beat up every time.

1000
01:15:26.583 --> 01:15:29.333
but as soon as I get back.
I'm going home to my papa.

1001
01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:35.583
Ah. but. Pinocchio.
what if you don't see your father again?

1002
01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:37.291
Of course I will.

1003
01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.666
Why wouldn't I?

1004
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:42.541
While you may have eternal life.

1005
01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:47.500
your friends.
your loved ones. they do not.

1006
01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:51.916
Every moment shared with them
may be the very last.

1007
01:15:52.833 --> 01:15:57.333
You never know how long
you have with someone until they're gone.

1008
01:15:57.416 --> 01:16:00.125
Huh? I… I don't understand.

1009
01:16:00.833 --> 01:16:03.000
Can… Can you tell me more?

1010
01:16:03.916 --> 01:16:07.875
Please? No! No! No!

1011
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.041
Aha!

1012
01:16:16.291 --> 01:16:19.166
I knew it! You came back to life.

1013
01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:22.625
Hi. Candlewick.

1014
01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:27.458
Most of us. we have but one life
to give for our fatherland. but you…

1015
01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:30.125
you have no limit!

1016
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:33.333
-Me?
-Yes!

1017
01:16:33.416 --> 01:16:34.333
You!

1018
01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:40.125
Follow my orders. learn to obey.
and you will be the perfect soldier.

1019
01:16:40.958 --> 01:16:42.750
But. my papa…

1020
01:16:42.833 --> 01:16:44.666
You'll return home a hero.

1021
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:47.000
Any father would be proud of such a son.

1022
01:16:49.125 --> 01:16:51.125
-We're here.

1023
01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:29.875
Wow!

1024
01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:31.416
What's all this?

1025
01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:34.833
The Elite Military Project
for Special Patriotic Youth.

1026
01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.958
-What's an elite?
-We are.

1027
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:39.875
We're gonna learn to be elite soldiers!

1028
01:17:39.958 --> 01:17:41.750
Learn? Like school?

1029
01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:46.541
To… To read and write
and do the <i>mulplitication</i> thingies?

1030
01:17:47.666 --> 01:17:49.500
You're funny.

1031
01:17:56.875 --> 01:17:57.875
Listen up.

1032
01:17:58.416 --> 01:18:01.500
They're reporting
hostile planes in the area.

1033
01:18:01.583 --> 01:18:06.291
But <i>we</i> will carry on
with the exercises tomorrow.

1034
01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:09.958
Anyone here afraid of the enemy?

1035
01:18:10.625 --> 01:18:12.583
-Uh-huh!
-No. sir!

1036
01:18:14.250 --> 01:18:15.291
Mm-mm.

1037
01:18:15.375 --> 01:18:16.625
Good.

1038
01:18:16.708 --> 01:18:20.208
You may be boys.
but you have the hearts of men.

1039
01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:26.958
Tomorrow. you train
for the glory of Italy!

1040
01:18:27.041 --> 01:18:30.750
Tomorrow. you will
make your fatherland proud.

1041
01:18:35.291 --> 01:18:37.166
Pinocchio. Pinocchio.

1042
01:18:37.666 --> 01:18:38.583
Yeah?

1043
01:18:39.166 --> 01:18:41.500
What do you think
my father meant about those planes?

1044
01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.041
I don't know.

1045
01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:47.000
I still don't really understand
what we're even doing here.

1046
01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:51.500
We're preparing to be soldiers. For war.

1047
01:18:51.583 --> 01:18:54.416
But my papa said war is bad.

1048
01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.250
That's 'cause he's a coward.

1049
01:18:56.333 --> 01:18:59.000
A coward? My papa?

1050
01:18:59.083 --> 01:19:01.083
Well. he's afraid of war. isn't he?

1051
01:19:01.166 --> 01:19:04.583
My father says if you're afraid to die
for your country. you're weak.

1052
01:19:04.666 --> 01:19:05.708
You're a coward.

1053
01:19:05.791 --> 01:19:07.208
Are you afraid?

1054
01:19:07.291 --> 01:19:08.375
I'm not afraid at all.

1055
01:19:08.458 --> 01:19:11.333
Well. neither am I. Or my papa.

1056
01:19:11.416 --> 01:19:13.375
-I love war.
-I love it more!

1057
01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:16.916
I love it twenty-four seven.
every day and anytime!

1058
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:20.458
-So do I!
-Well. we'll see about that. won't we?

1059
01:19:25.041 --> 01:19:26.583
I'll show him I'm no coward.

1060
01:19:27.083 --> 01:19:28.333
I'll make him like me.

1061
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:34.833
You know.
all fathers love their sons. but…

1062
01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:41.625
sometimes fathers feel despair.
like everyone else.

1063
01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:45.208
And they say things
they only think they mean in the moment.

1064
01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:51.500
But with time. they learn
they never really meant it at all.

1065
01:19:52.625 --> 01:19:58.791
And they may even call you ugly things
like a burden or a coward.

1066
01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:00.583
but inside…

1067
01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:03.708
they love you.

1068
01:20:08.083 --> 01:20:09.166
Are you scared?

1069
01:20:10.458 --> 01:20:11.500
Of dying?

1070
01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:14.666
Me? Nah.

1071
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:16.250
I died a couple times.

1072
01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:17.333
It was all right.

1073
01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:22.666
There's rabbits and card games
and a lot of sand.

1074
01:20:23.291 --> 01:20:24.708
Blue sand.

1075
01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:27.333
You're so weird.

1076
01:20:27.416 --> 01:20:29.708
No weirder than you. pal!

1077
01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:40.166
I'm… I'm glad you're here.

1078
01:20:43.583 --> 01:20:44.583
Me too.

1079
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.125
And as with all great empires.

1080
01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:54.625
the destiny of Italy will be forged

1081
01:20:54.708 --> 01:20:56.666
in the strength of its youth.

1082
01:20:57.791 --> 01:21:02.083
Today. you'll get your first taste of war.

1083
01:21:03.166 --> 01:21:04.791
You'll form two teams.

1084
01:21:05.791 --> 01:21:08.958
In the center of the battlefield
is a tower.

1085
01:21:09.666 --> 01:21:16.000
The first team to place their flag
at the top of the tower wins.

1086
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:17.791
And remember.

1087
01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:21.083
no matter who is on the other team.

1088
01:21:21.166 --> 01:21:23.250
they are your enemy.

1089
01:21:25.333 --> 01:21:26.708
May the best man win

1090
01:21:26.791 --> 01:21:31.208
and bring glory to his team
and honor to us all.

1091
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:36.750
Rifles are loaded with paint.

1092
01:21:37.708 --> 01:21:39.791
And the grenades. confetti.

1093
01:21:39.875 --> 01:21:41.875
-Mark your kill. boys.

1094
01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:44.041
-For Italia!

1095
01:21:44.125 --> 01:21:45.750
-Hey!

1096
01:21:45.833 --> 01:21:47.958
-Watch it!

1097
01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.250
W-- Wait!

1098
01:22:16.208 --> 01:22:18.458
Come on. boys! Let's go!

1099
01:22:24.125 --> 01:22:26.000
-Go! Go!
-Charge!

1100
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.208
-Watch out!
-Oh!

1101
01:22:36.541 --> 01:22:38.333
Faster! Follow me!

1102
01:22:56.208 --> 01:22:57.166
Take this.

1103
01:24:00.916 --> 01:24:03.000
You're both here. Why?

1104
01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:06.250
We both won. Father!

1105
01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:09.250
Oh. Is that so?

1106
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:13.583
And how did you come
to that conclusion. may I ask?

1107
01:24:13.666 --> 01:24:15.166
It was a tie.

1108
01:24:16.375 --> 01:24:18.166
We both climbed up fast.

1109
01:24:19.625 --> 01:24:20.791
Very good. then.

1110
01:24:22.541 --> 01:24:23.583
Candlewick…

1111
01:24:26.541 --> 01:24:27.583
…shoot the puppet.

1112
01:24:35.416 --> 01:24:36.916
But. Father…

1113
01:24:41.083 --> 01:24:43.375
this is a real gun.

1114
01:24:45.166 --> 01:24:46.916
Take your glory. son!

1115
01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.583
Shoot the puppet!

1116
01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:53.000
<i>Take your positions on the parapets.</i>

1117
01:24:54.333 --> 01:24:55.791
<i>Defend the center.</i>

1118
01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.791
<i>For Italy!</i>

1119
01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.125
We are under attack!

1120
01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:05.833
I told you to shoot the puppet!

1121
01:25:05.916 --> 01:25:08.458
No! I will not let you do this!

1122
01:25:12.458 --> 01:25:15.166
All my life. Father.
just trying to please you.

1123
01:25:16.625 --> 01:25:17.833
But I never will!

1124
01:25:18.541 --> 01:25:19.375
You were right.

1125
01:25:19.458 --> 01:25:23.791
I'm thin and weak and flimsy.
just like the wick of a candle.

1126
01:25:23.875 --> 01:25:24.875
Always afraid.

1127
01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:29.208
But even then. with all the fear I feel.
I can say no to you.

1128
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:31.250
-I can do that.

1129
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:34.750
I'm not afraid to say no. Are you?

1130
01:25:35.541 --> 01:25:37.125
You filthy coward!

1131
01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:41.041
Yes. you are weak!

1132
01:25:41.916 --> 01:25:44.541
You are no son of mine!

1133
01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:47.250
Candlewick!

1134
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:49.875
Puppet!

1135
01:25:51.166 --> 01:25:52.458
On your feet.

1136
01:25:57.708 --> 01:25:59.458
Time for the final lesson.

1137
01:26:06.083 --> 01:26:07.000
Now.

1138
01:26:07.583 --> 01:26:10.958
you will know what it is
to truly serve the fatherland!

1139
01:26:11.791 --> 01:26:13.041
Ah!

1140
01:26:38.625 --> 01:26:42.041
Ah! Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

1141
01:26:55.708 --> 01:26:57.791
Hello. my little rebel.

1142
01:26:58.875 --> 01:27:01.083
I've found you at last.

1143
01:27:01.875 --> 01:27:03.541
I lost everything.

1144
01:27:04.458 --> 01:27:05.916
And now you will too.

1145
01:27:13.166 --> 01:27:15.583
-Huh?

1146
01:27:15.666 --> 01:27:17.125
Candlewick!

1147
01:27:17.208 --> 01:27:19.583
<i>Bonjour. mon étoile.</i>

1148
01:27:19.666 --> 01:27:22.291
No! Where's Candlewick?

1149
01:27:22.833 --> 01:27:26.125
Spazzatura! Please! Help me!

1150
01:27:27.916 --> 01:27:30.708
I'm all he has in this world.
the poor thing.

1151
01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:32.708
I have forgiven him.

1152
01:27:32.791 --> 01:27:36.416
-But you! You squandered everything!

1153
01:27:41.583 --> 01:27:43.583
Give me that torch. Spazzatura!

1154
01:27:44.958 --> 01:27:46.166
Spazzatura!

1155
01:27:47.333 --> 01:27:50.666
-Ah! Give me that. you mangy ape!

1156
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:51.958
Let me go!

1157
01:27:53.291 --> 01:27:55.875
Is our contract worth nothing?

1158
01:27:56.416 --> 01:27:58.208
I'll do my part.

1159
01:27:58.291 --> 01:28:00.541
and you. you will burn.

1160
01:28:01.083 --> 01:28:02.166
Burn bright!

1161
01:28:02.666 --> 01:28:04.125
Like a star!

1162
01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:07.958
Hey. that's hot!

1163
01:28:08.041 --> 01:28:09.291
Worse than chocolate!

1164
01:28:09.375 --> 01:28:11.333
-Ow! Ow!

1165
01:28:11.416 --> 01:28:12.416
Help!

1166
01:28:13.875 --> 01:28:15.083
Please! Help!

1167
01:28:15.166 --> 01:28:17.625
-Help! Ow!

1168
01:28:17.708 --> 01:28:18.625
Help!

1169
01:28:19.708 --> 01:28:20.916
-Ah!

1170
01:28:26.875 --> 01:28:28.208
Whoa!

1171
01:28:29.208 --> 01:28:32.208
How could you do this to me?

1172
01:28:32.291 --> 01:28:33.750
And for a puppet?

1173
01:28:33.833 --> 01:28:37.291
You loathsome <i>lusus naturae</i>!

1174
01:28:40.166 --> 01:28:43.625
You will betray me no more!

1175
01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:18.208
Spazzatura!

1176
01:29:40.416 --> 01:29:41.708
Spazzatura.

1177
01:29:42.958 --> 01:29:45.041
Will I ever see my papa again?

1178
01:29:45.125 --> 01:29:47.416
-Huh?

1179
01:29:51.041 --> 01:29:51.875
Huh?

1180
01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:02.791
Look! An island!

1181
01:30:18.458 --> 01:30:22.250
-Swim!

1182
01:30:27.958 --> 01:30:28.875
Whoa!

1183
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:47.708
Huh?

1184
01:30:54.291 --> 01:30:55.125
Huh?

1185
01:30:59.083 --> 01:31:00.041
Ugh.

1186
01:31:18.666 --> 01:31:21.458
Papa? Papa!

1187
01:31:33.166 --> 01:31:34.125
Papa!

1188
01:31:35.125 --> 01:31:37.041
-You're alive!

1189
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:41.583
Pinocchio!

1190
01:31:42.916 --> 01:31:44.708
Oh.

1191
01:31:44.791 --> 01:31:46.833
-My Pinocchio.

1192
01:31:51.041 --> 01:31:52.083
Love hurts.

1193
01:32:01.791 --> 01:32:03.708
You'll be okay. Papa.

1194
01:32:03.791 --> 01:32:07.791
After you're feeling better.
we'll go right home. Okay?

1195
01:32:08.666 --> 01:32:10.291
No. Pinocchio. no.

1196
01:32:11.375 --> 01:32:14.125
There's no escape from this dreaded beast.

1197
01:32:15.083 --> 01:32:20.375
He comes seeking the warmth of the sun
every decade or so.

1198
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:24.916
It will soon sink back to the depths

1199
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.125
of the darkest. coldest ocean
where it dwells.

1200
01:32:29.208 --> 01:32:32.875
and it will drag us with him.

1201
01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.958
Oh my God! This is it!

1202
01:32:36.875 --> 01:32:39.291
-Follow me!

1203
01:32:40.041 --> 01:32:41.083
Follow you? Where?

1204
01:32:41.166 --> 01:32:44.166
Up to the lighthouse and freedom!

1205
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.583
The blow holes!
We can climb out through them!

1206
01:33:01.666 --> 01:33:04.833
But we… we'll never reach it.
It's… It's too far!

1207
01:33:05.583 --> 01:33:06.916
Pinocchio can help!

1208
01:33:08.541 --> 01:33:09.625
Pinocchio. look.

1209
01:33:09.708 --> 01:33:11.875
Listen. Listen.
Okay. we have to climb…

1210
01:33:13.458 --> 01:33:15.291
What is it. Pinocchio?

1211
01:33:17.208 --> 01:33:19.166
Oh. Papa. I hate you!

1212
01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:21.083
What? Well. what do you--

1213
01:33:21.166 --> 01:33:25.750
And I hate you too. Spazzatura.
And you. Sebastian J. Cricket!

1214
01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:32.666
Yes. I see!
Just this once. lie. m'boy!

1215
01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:34.166
Yes. that's it! Lie!

1216
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:36.166
My name is Panucchio!

1217
01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:37.500
More. Pinocchio!

1218
01:33:37.583 --> 01:33:39.583
I love the smell of onions!

1219
01:33:39.666 --> 01:33:41.333
I love… I love war!

1220
01:33:43.083 --> 01:33:46.083
I wanna be trapped here
forever and ever and ever!

1221
01:33:46.583 --> 01:33:48.166
That's it!

1222
01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:51.916
Climb now! Everybody. climb!

1223
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:53.916
Hurry! Come on!

1224
01:33:56.625 --> 01:33:58.291
-What are you--

1225
01:33:58.375 --> 01:33:59.208
Oh.

1226
01:33:59.875 --> 01:34:02.416
Oh. Now steady on… Whoa!

1227
01:34:11.875 --> 01:34:14.708
Oh. Oh. Oh my word. Oh dear.

1228
01:34:18.416 --> 01:34:20.500
Whoa. Hold it. Whoa.

1229
01:34:29.416 --> 01:34:30.250
That's it!

1230
01:34:32.583 --> 01:34:35.375
Don't look down. Pinocchio!

1231
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:38.291
Look at me!

1232
01:34:39.208 --> 01:34:40.791
-Look at your papa!

1233
01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.250
Ah!

1234
01:34:46.625 --> 01:34:48.208
He's going to sneeze! Hurry!

1235
01:35:00.833 --> 01:35:01.875
Ah!

1236
01:35:01.958 --> 01:35:03.750
No! No! Ah!

1237
01:35:03.833 --> 01:35:05.166
I've got you. son.

1238
01:35:07.958 --> 01:35:09.791
-Hold on. my boy!

1239
01:35:09.875 --> 01:35:12.208
-Ah!
-Help! Help!

1240
01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:55.208
Ah.

1241
01:36:07.166 --> 01:36:08.500
Uh-oh.

1242
01:36:08.583 --> 01:36:09.458
Whoa!

1243
01:36:18.125 --> 01:36:21.166
-Oh no! Pinocchio!

1244
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.083
Papa!

1245
01:36:38.041 --> 01:36:39.708
Papa!

1246
01:36:46.875 --> 01:36:48.833
It's coming for us! Quick!

1247
01:37:01.958 --> 01:37:04.541
Come on. Spazzatura. You can do it!

1248
01:37:26.083 --> 01:37:27.125
Ah!

1249
01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:29.541
Ah! Ah! Ah!

1250
01:37:31.291 --> 01:37:33.250
Yes. faster. Spazzatura!

1251
01:37:33.833 --> 01:37:35.166
Hold on!

1252
01:37:42.458 --> 01:37:43.291
Ah!

1253
01:38:15.416 --> 01:38:17.875
No. not now!

1254
01:38:21.541 --> 01:38:24.208
Send me back now! Please!

1255
01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:27.916
I need to go back to save my papa.

1256
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.958
You know the rules. Pinocchio.

1257
01:38:30.791 --> 01:38:34.541
All the sand must fall
before you can return.

1258
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:37.875
There's no time! He's dying!

1259
01:38:37.958 --> 01:38:40.000
Rules are rules.

1260
01:38:40.083 --> 01:38:41.666
and if we break them.

1261
01:38:43.166 --> 01:38:45.583
there are dire consequences.

1262
01:38:46.166 --> 01:38:49.416
If you were to go back now. so soon.

1263
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.208
you would become mortal.

1264
01:38:53.958 --> 01:38:55.500
You might save Geppetto.

1265
01:38:56.625 --> 01:38:58.791
but you will die. Pinocchio.

1266
01:38:59.666 --> 01:39:02.250
and it will be your last life.

1267
01:39:04.541 --> 01:39:06.208
I don't care!

1268
01:39:06.291 --> 01:39:07.458
Send me back!

1269
01:39:09.875 --> 01:39:10.791
Do it!

1270
01:39:11.333 --> 01:39:13.291
Not me. wooden boy.

1271
01:39:14.333 --> 01:39:17.250
Break the rules. Break them.

1272
01:39:18.291 --> 01:39:19.750
If you're sure.

1273
01:39:34.291 --> 01:39:37.083
Now. go to your father. child.

1274
01:39:39.458 --> 01:39:41.250
And make the most of it.

1275
01:40:26.041 --> 01:40:27.750
Ah!

1276
01:41:02.291 --> 01:41:04.500
We made it!

1277
01:41:05.708 --> 01:41:07.000
I can't believe it!

1278
01:41:07.916 --> 01:41:10.583
Ah.

1279
01:41:28.208 --> 01:41:29.375
Pinocchio.

1280
01:41:33.541 --> 01:41:36.000
My boy. My boy.

1281
01:41:39.333 --> 01:41:41.125
Wake up. Pinocchio.

1282
01:41:43.166 --> 01:41:44.375
Like last time!

1283
01:41:45.625 --> 01:41:46.458
Get up!

1284
01:41:48.208 --> 01:41:49.708
You're fine. You… You…

1285
01:41:57.416 --> 01:41:58.541
You are here.

1286
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.041
My dear son.

1287
01:42:02.208 --> 01:42:03.291
Can't you see me?

1288
01:42:04.958 --> 01:42:06.541
You're… You're alive.

1289
01:42:07.625 --> 01:42:09.291
You're so free. I…

1290
01:42:11.166 --> 01:42:12.541
I need you.

1291
01:42:14.125 --> 01:42:16.416
Son.

1292
01:42:45.041 --> 01:42:46.375
Master Geppetto.

1293
01:42:50.625 --> 01:42:53.541
I only wished to bring you joy.

1294
01:42:55.416 --> 01:42:56.458
And you did.

1295
01:42:57.958 --> 01:42:59.541
You did bring me joy.

1296
01:43:00.333 --> 01:43:04.541
Such terrible. terrible joy.

1297
01:43:07.166 --> 01:43:10.291
Please. bring him back to me.

1298
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:14.875
To save you.
he became a real boy.

1299
01:43:16.166 --> 01:43:19.416
And real boys don't come back.

1300
01:43:21.625 --> 01:43:22.750
I know that.

1301
01:43:24.583 --> 01:43:26.375
I know! But…

1302
01:43:28.958 --> 01:43:30.291
It's not fair!

1303
01:43:33.125 --> 01:43:35.833
In this world.
you get what you give. remember?

1304
01:43:35.916 --> 01:43:37.250
And this boy gave…

1305
01:43:37.958 --> 01:43:40.125
Well. he gave everything he could!

1306
01:43:42.458 --> 01:43:47.041
You said if I should perform my duties
and make Pinocchio a good boy.

1307
01:43:47.125 --> 01:43:50.625
guide him into doing what is right.
you would concede me one wish.

1308
01:43:52.166 --> 01:43:53.083
I did.

1309
01:43:53.958 --> 01:43:56.375
And did you accomplish this task?

1310
01:43:56.458 --> 01:43:59.625
Okay! Fine. So maybe I didn't do so great.

1311
01:43:59.708 --> 01:44:01.958
Maybe I messed up a little or… a lot.

1312
01:44:02.041 --> 01:44:06.916
but. well. I tried my best.
and that's the best anyone can do.

1313
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.458
Pinocchio taught me that.

1314
01:44:09.125 --> 01:44:12.333
I mean. I taught it to him.
and then he taught it straight back at me.

1315
01:44:12.416 --> 01:44:13.833
And you know why? Because…

1316
01:44:15.375 --> 01:44:16.833
Because he was good.

1317
01:44:25.583 --> 01:44:28.208
Well. then. noble cricket.

1318
01:44:29.166 --> 01:44:30.750
choose wisely.

1319
01:44:32.166 --> 01:44:33.916
Well. gosh darn it!

1320
01:44:34.708 --> 01:44:36.333
I wish him back to life!

1321
01:44:38.291 --> 01:44:39.666
Very well. then.

1322
01:44:45.916 --> 01:44:48.625
Little wooden boy made of pine.

1323
01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:51.416
may you rise with the sun

1324
01:44:53.291 --> 01:44:55.166
and wander the earth.

1325
01:44:56.166 --> 01:44:57.375
Be his son.

1326
01:44:58.375 --> 01:45:00.708
Fill his days with light…

1327
01:45:09.625 --> 01:45:12.166
…so he'll never be alone.

1328
01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:18.750
Pinocchio.

1329
01:45:20.250 --> 01:45:21.916
My child.

1330
01:45:23.958 --> 01:45:27.500
I was trying
to make you someone you were not.

1331
01:45:28.458 --> 01:45:33.708
So don't be Carlo or anyone else.

1332
01:45:33.791 --> 01:45:36.375
Be exactly who you are.

1333
01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:39.333
I…

1334
01:45:40.791 --> 01:45:41.833
I love you

1335
01:45:43.125 --> 01:45:44.833
exactly as you are.

1336
01:45:52.416 --> 01:45:54.583
Then I will be Pinocchio.

1337
01:45:55.833 --> 01:45:57.666
And you will be my papa.

1338
01:45:58.250 --> 01:45:59.583
Will that do?

1339
01:46:01.083 --> 01:46:03.125
That will do.

1340
01:46:34.083 --> 01:46:35.250
Aw.

1341
01:46:35.333 --> 01:46:36.166
Oh.

1342
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.166
Life is such a wonderful gift.

1343
01:46:55.125 --> 01:46:58.125
<i>And so it was</i>
<i>that we lived our lives.</i>

1344
01:47:02.375 --> 01:47:03.666
-Checkmate!

1345
01:47:05.625 --> 01:47:07.875
<i>We never saw</i>
<i>the wood sprite again.</i>

1346
01:47:12.458 --> 01:47:13.833
<i>Geppetto aged.</i>

1347
01:47:14.958 --> 01:47:16.291
<i>Pinocchio didn't.</i>

1348
01:47:19.083 --> 01:47:22.416
<i>And in time. Geppetto left.</i>

1349
01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:33.916
<i>One winter morning.</i>
<i>Pinocchio found me by the window.</i>

1350
01:47:34.958 --> 01:47:36.458
<i>I wasn't moving anymore.</i>

1351
01:47:37.041 --> 01:47:42.250
<i>So he put me in a matchbox.</i>
<i>and he carries me still with him.</i>

1352
01:47:45.166 --> 01:47:46.416
<i>Right in his heart.</i>

1353
01:48:15.875 --> 01:48:17.791
<i>He ventured into the world.</i>

1354
01:48:17.875 --> 01:48:21.416
<i>And the world.</i>
<i>I believe. embraced him back.</i>

1355
01:48:23.458 --> 01:48:25.500
<i>I've not heard of him in quite a while.</i>

1356
01:48:26.916 --> 01:48:28.375
<i>Will he eventually die?</i>

1357
01:48:29.666 --> 01:48:30.666
<i>I think so.</i>

1358
01:48:31.541 --> 01:48:33.625
<i>And maybe that makes him a real boy.</i>

1359
01:48:34.791 --> 01:48:37.208
<i>What happens. happens.</i>

1360
01:48:38.125 --> 01:48:41.000
<i>And then. we are gone.</i>

1361
01:49:03.125 --> 01:49:05.833
Are you gonna keep yappin'.
or are you gonna play?

1362
01:49:05.916 --> 01:49:07.291
Do you mind?

1363
01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:09.708
I was recounting my life!

1364
01:49:09.791 --> 01:49:11.291
It was a good life!

1365
01:49:11.375 --> 01:49:13.083
Ah. good enough.

1366
01:49:15.625 --> 01:49:17.083
Hit it. boys!
