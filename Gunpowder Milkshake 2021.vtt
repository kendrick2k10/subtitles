I don't think I'll ever walk again.

543
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:13.250
There must be an epidemic.

544
00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:16.291
'cause I got a guy in the next room
who's got similar symptoms.

545
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.291
What do you mean?

546

-[Sam sighs]
-You're bleeding.

551
00:37:34.083 --> 00:37:35.416
It's just a scratch.

552

It can get infected.

553
00:37:38.083 --> 00:37:42.166
Worms will get in there and lay eggs.
Then they'll have to cut your arm off.

554

Yeah.

560
00:37:57.041 --> 00:37:58.875
Is that why he didn't come?

561
00:37:59.625 --> 00:38:00.708
Is he sick?

562
00:38:01.708 --> 00:38:02.666
He…

563
00:38:03.916 --> 00:38:05.083
[Emily] It's okay.

564
00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:07.166
You don't have to lie for him.

565
00:38:08.041 --> 00:38:10.250
He never comes when he says he will.

566
00:38:17.583 --> 00:38:20.458

Sure.

570
00:38:31.833 --> 00:38:33.166
Are you sure it's her?

571
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.625
[leader] Yeah. She dropped off
some guy she shot.

572
00:38:35.708 --> 00:38:38.375
Said she's going to come back
and pick him up later.

575
00:38:43.958 --> 00:38:45.375
Then get it back.

576

Shot in the shoulder.

591
00:41:00.541 --> 00:41:02.625
Maybe you should take your break now.

592
00:41:10.291 --> 00:41:12.125
So. My payment?

593
00:41:13.125 --> 00:41:15.583

598
00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:25.791
[together] Oh.

599
00:41:25.875 --> 00:41:29.166
Once I stick her with this.
she'll start losing control of her arms.

It's just a scratch.

607
00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.791
Well. scratches get infected.

608
00:42:00.875 --> 00:42:02.375
That's how you lose an arm.

609
00:42:03.125 --> 00:42:05.625
Mm. Yeah. I heard.

Someone shot him.

01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:38.125
Emily.

907
01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:39.833
Come.

908
01:00:40.416 --> 01:00:42.041
[sighs. sniffs]

909
01:00:48.666 --> 01:00:51.583
[on TV] …the additional burden
of needing to care

910
01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:53.708
for her twelve-month-old daughter.

911
01:00:53.791 --> 01:00:55.166
It will be at least a year…

912
01:00:55.875 --> 01:00:57.416
[electrical zapping]

913
01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:04.333
That is a hell of a story.

914
01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:07.625
Mm. Hell of a night.

915
01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:12.375
Um… Try wiggling your fingers.

916
01:01:13.041 --> 01:01:15.833
-Feeling should come back in no time.
-Yeah. it's already working.

917
01:01:15.916 --> 01:01:17.291
Excellent.

918
01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:23.541
You look really good. Are you eating well?

919
01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:24.791
Cut the crap. Ma.

920
01:01:26.625 --> 01:01:28.708
Where have you been for the last 15 years?

921
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.083
Around.

922
01:01:34.375 --> 01:01:35.500
Watching you.

923
01:01:38.041 --> 01:01:39.666
Making sure you're safe.

924
01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:41.625
Great parenting.

925
01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:44.458
Glad to see you taking an interest
in my career.

926
01:01:44.541 --> 01:01:47.791
-I never wanted this life for you.
-How's that working out for you?

927
01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:55.916
I wanted to stay with you
and your aunts. but I couldn't.

928
01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:57.916
Why not?

929
01:02:00.875 --> 01:02:02.166
Because I fucked up.

930
01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:09.458
[quietly] I fucked up.

931
01:02:11.458 --> 01:02:13.125
I was young when I had you.

932
01:02:13.208 --> 01:02:14.416
[soft emotional music]

933
01:02:15.041 --> 01:02:17.666
We left London. followed your father here.
When he died--

934
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.541
When he was murdered.

935
01:02:21.916 --> 01:02:24.708
When he was murdered.
you were a baby. I had nothing.

936
01:02:25.791 --> 01:02:27.416
No money. nowhere to go.

937
01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.458
I knew Anna May from your dad's work.

938
01:02:32.041 --> 01:02:34.250
She and the other aunts took us in.

939
01:02:35.416 --> 01:02:37.291
The best years of my life.

940
01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:38.875
Me too.

941
01:02:42.708 --> 01:02:46.000
Fast-forward twelve years.
and I find out who shot your dad.

942
01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:48.875
The Russians?

943
01:02:49.708 --> 01:02:51.416
The Russians from the diner?

944
01:02:51.958 --> 01:02:55.375
Once I knew. I couldn't let him
walk around enjoying life…

945
01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:58.750
knowing what he did to us.

946
01:03:00.916 --> 01:03:04.416
But he was in bed with The Firm.
so there was a price to pay.

947
01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:08.250
Once I killed him.
there was a mark on my back.

948
01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:12.333
[soft emotional music]

949
01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.750
[voice breaks]
I couldn't take you with me.

950
01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:21.708
I couldn't risk your life.

951
01:03:25.208 --> 01:03:27.458
So I made Nathan promise to keep you safe.

952
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:33.125
I guess that's over.

953
01:03:36.416 --> 01:03:39.916
There isn't a day that goes by
I don't regret pulling that trigger.

954
01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.625
But back then. I couldn't help myself.

955
01:03:47.208 --> 01:03:48.458
I'm sorry.

956
01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:53.625
[music fades out]

957
01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:03.333
Does the kid know about you and her dad?

958
01:04:03.416 --> 01:04:04.416
[Sam] No.

959
01:04:06.833 --> 01:04:08.166
But she's smart.

960
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.666
She'll figure it out.

961
01:04:11.625 --> 01:04:13.125
What happens when she does?

962
01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:24.291
-[inaudible TV chatter]
-[soft emotional music]

963
01:04:30.416 --> 01:04:32.375
I think there's a bad man outside.

964
01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.708
We have to get out of here.

965
01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:47.583
-So. what's the plan?
-Can you press the lobby button?

966
01:04:47.666 --> 01:04:50.125
-What plan?
-Come on. you always have a plan.

967
01:04:50.208 --> 01:04:52.833
A secret escape route?
A warehouse filled with guns?

968
01:04:52.916 --> 01:04:53.958
I called us an Uber.

969
01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:55.500
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

970
01:04:55.583 --> 01:04:57.708
An Uber.
What the hell are you talking about?

971
01:04:57.791 --> 01:04:59.541
I know you. You make plans.

972
01:04:59.625 --> 01:05:01.791
And then you make plans
to make other plans.

973
01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:04.875
-You're frothing at the mouth.
-[rousing music]

974

[mockingly] Don't feel bad.

982
01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:37.541
Could happen to anyone.

983
01:05:37.625 --> 01:05:39.333
My hand is still paralyzed.

984
01:05:39.416 --> 01:05:40.958
Yeah. course it is.

985
01:05:41.041 --> 01:05:42.875
-It is.
-I know.

989
01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:59.041
[Scarlet] Come on. Hurry up.

-[Sam] Where does it go?
-Fucking Narnia.

991

Go. In.

992
01:06:03.291 --> 01:06:04.958
-In!
-[scoffs] Fine.

-[Sam] No plan. huh?
-[Scarlet] Now is not the time.

994
01:06:21.916 --> 01:06:23.166

-[Sam] Need help. Ma?
-No. thank you.

-Go where?

1009

-Mom. listen.

We need a safe house!

I'm not sure they'd let me in!

-Hi. Madeleine.
-Hi. Scarlet.

-Hi. Anna May.
-No.

1026
01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:53.166
No. no. You don't get to talk.

1027
01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:56.958
Because you're a ghost.
and ghosts can't talk.

1028
01:08:57.458 --> 01:08:58.708
You know how I know that?

1029
01:08:59.291 --> 01:09:00.666
Can we do this later?

1030
01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:02.291
Because if ghosts could talk.

1031
01:09:03.166 --> 01:09:05.875
they would say something
before disappearing.

1032
01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:09.083
Or at least leave a note. But they can't.

1033

and they fed me to McAlester's
endless supply of thugs.

1046
01:09:44.166 --> 01:09:45.791
And you decided to come here?

1047

Shall we return
at a more convenient time?

1048
01:09:48.291 --> 01:09:49.541
Maybe you should.

1049
01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:52.000
[Anna May] It seems like
whenever you come here.

1050
01:09:52.083 --> 01:09:53.708
you bring a war with you.

1051
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.125
Bring your problems--

1052
01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.125
We need to table this.

I'll buy us some time.

-I think I should stay.
-[banging]

1063

No.

1064
01:10:37.041 --> 01:10:38.541

[whispers] Come.

1070
01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:57.708
Are you sure?
I could use the target practice.

1071
01:10:57.791 --> 01:10:58.791
Mm-mm.

1072
01:10:59.291 --> 01:11:00.541
Anna May was right.

1073
01:11:01.916 --> 01:11:03.958
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:15.750

-No. No. you're not.
-[door bangs]

You're going to the basement.
where it's safe.

1078
01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:23.458
But you need me. I'm your apprentice.

1079
01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:25.291
[whispers] Okay. listen. Emily.

1080
01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:28.750
