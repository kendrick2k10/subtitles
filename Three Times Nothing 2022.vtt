00:00:58.433 --> 00:00:59.393
Yeah?

4
00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:02.396
20 minutes.
Sorry. people are waiting.

5
00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:21.748
20 minutes.

6
00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:23.834
Sir. please.

7
00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:35.345
No dogs allowed.

8
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.430
What?

9
00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:37.931
Leave it outside.

10
00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.683
He won't shower with me.

11
00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.852
Please. gimme a break.

12
00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:43.562
I've been on the road.

13
00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:45.022
- Come on.
- Sorry. no.

14
00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:46.148
Why not? Why not?

15
00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:47.524
- The rules.
- Why not?

16
00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.949
Young man. sorry to disturb you.

17
00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:59.828
Would you have some spare change
or a spare smoke?

18
00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.622
It's freezing out.

19
00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:04.708
Thanks. very kind.

20
00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:08.294
I like young people.
They're generous.

21
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.048
For a survey...

22
00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:13.759
Can you help an old kid starting out

23
00:02:13.884 --> 00:02:16.637
with some change or a meal ticket?

24
00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:18.680
Shit. zilch.

25
00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.224
Go on. I'll wait.

26
00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.226
Later. there's a line-up.

27
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:25.145
Either now. or we split.
It's a shitshow.

28
00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:26.438
Sorry!

29
00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:27.606
Will you watch him?

30
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:28.774
They won't let him in.

31
00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:29.942
He doesn't bite.

32
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.026
No!

33
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.319
We're leaving.

34
00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:34.279
I'll mind your mutt.

35
00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:35.864
Give him here.

36
00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:36.990
Thanks. dude.

37
00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.659
- Welcome.
- I'll hurry.

38
00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.413
It's alright. I'm here.

39
00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:45.040
Quiet. Shush!

40
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.584
It's fine. go do your thing.

41
00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.836
I'll stay a bit.

42
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:51.338
Maybe I'll be able to take my shower.

43
00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:53.215
Fine. I'll get supper.

44
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.424
Sounds good.

45
00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:56.635
It's Wednesday?

46
00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:58.971
Lottery day!

47
00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:02.975
- Later.
- See you.

48
00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.895
Quiet now. Shush.

49
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:10.440
Excuse me.

50
00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:11.733
could you spare...

51
00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:29.877
THREE TIMES NOTHING

52
00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.716
Thanks. Bachir.

53
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:19.843
Enjoy.

54
00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:21.428
- See you next week.
- Bye.

55
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.757
No. doggie! Shoo!

56
00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:00.425
That's my sandwich!

57
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:02.302
Go away! Beat it!

58
00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.429
Smart pooch. He found you.

59
00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:05.764
Come. boy!

60
00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:06.849
Get off!

61
00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:08.016
You good?

62
00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.894
We have brews. Arrow's treat.

63
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:12.729
- Arrow?
- Yeah.

64
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.731
You're Twiggy?

65
00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:16.567
- Yeah.
- Hey. dude!

66
00:05:16.692 --> 00:05:18.819
No. I just washed my hands.

67
00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:20.320
Please pull him off.

68
00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:21.947
Get off the fat guy.

69
00:05:23.365 --> 00:05:24.449
Binoculars!

70
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:25.993
Can I try 'em?

71
00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:27.703
No. hands off!

72
00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.746
- Want a beer?
- No. I'm eating.

73
00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:32.541
Eat. it's still warm.
I got you fries.

74
00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:34.376
- Sorry...
- Wow!

75
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.377
Arrow?

76
00:05:35.502 --> 00:05:36.920
You can scope peeps.

77
00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.006
- A beer?
- Nah. I'm allergic.

78
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.299
C'mon!

79
00:05:40.424 --> 00:05:42.342
My teeth gnash. my head spins.

80
00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:44.303
I talk shit and then puke.

81
00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:46.471
Tough. man.

82
00:05:46.597 --> 00:05:49.558
Same with weed. Doesn't agree with me.

83
00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:51.476
Not the end of the world.

84
00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:53.353
- May I?
- No!

85
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:55.189
OK. you know what?

86
00:05:55.314 --> 00:05:56.815
Here. take them.

87
00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:59.401
Sit over there with your mutt.

88
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.445
OK. thanks.

89
00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:09.411
Well?

90
00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:10.495
What?

91
00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:11.830
Arrow?

92
00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:15.417
He just arrived in Paris.
he has nowhere to go.

93
00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.378
I invited him.
Besides. he bought us beer.

94
00:06:19.171 --> 00:06:22.799
I agree. he's a bit dim.
but he's harmless.

95
00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:25.093
You mean. the dog?

96
00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:29.765
So. where do we go tonight?

97
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.266
- Papua.
- What?

98
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.393
Papua. I really need sun.

99
00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:36.605
Papua. with a P.

100
00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:39.900
Papua's been on my mind.

101
00:06:40.192 --> 00:06:41.610
Arrow? Oh.

102
00:06:41.735 --> 00:06:42.945
Where would you go?

103
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.446
It's a game?

104
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.822
He can't play!

105
00:06:45.948 --> 00:06:47.741
- Sure I can.
- No way.

106
00:06:47.866 --> 00:06:49.535
I bought the lotto ticket.

107
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.870
The ticket? You said the beer!

108
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:52.955
Also.

109
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.792
I was two euros short.
so I let him mark the squares.

110
00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:58.710
He had fun. so what?

111
00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:01.421
You let him fill in the squares. too?

112
00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:04.716
No worries. I gave him the numbers.
He had fun.

113
00:07:04.842 --> 00:07:06.218
Where'd me go if I won?

114
00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:08.053
Take French lessons. maybe?

115
00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:09.847
What? What'd you say?

116
00:07:09.972 --> 00:07:11.640
With your loser accent?

117
00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.851
Could we just play?

118
00:07:13.976 --> 00:07:16.520
So. Arrow. if you won.
where would you go?

119
00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:18.146
Fuck. it started!

120
00:07:19.398 --> 00:07:20.357
45.

121
00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.817
- Did we pick it?
- No!

122
00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:25.654
Name a place you'd like to go.

123
00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.990
- Your dream destination.
- I dunno...

124
00:07:28.282 --> 00:07:29.366
The moon.

125
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.829
My dream's to go to the moon
and draw a huge dick on it.

126
00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:36.915
So everyone who looks up seen it!

127
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.250
Sees it!

128
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.420
Not the moon.
it has to be attainable.

129
00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:43.046
7! We picked that!

130
00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:47.926
C'mon. it'll be over before we started.
Name your dream destination.

131
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:50.345
How do I know. Christ?

132
00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.056
Disneyland! There.

133
00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.227
Disneyland?

134
00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.897
- Arrow!
- What?

135
00:08:00.022 --> 00:08:01.273
It's on earth.

136
00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:05.736
Sure. perfect. What a great trip!

137
00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:08.655
Fuck. I missed one. 29!

138
00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.948
- Our number?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.576
And... 36! Cap. we have it.
That's three!

140
00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.954
Three's worth at least 20 euros.

141
00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.582
If we get the joker. it's a grand.

142
00:08:18.707 --> 00:08:19.875
Here. gimme.

143
00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:22.836
Where is it?

144
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:26.632
So the joker is... number 10.

145
00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:28.175
Do we have it?

146
00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:34.181
I can't hear you. someone's screaming.

147
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.517
Hold on a sec.

148
00:08:37.476 --> 00:08:38.977
It's getting worse.

149
00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:41.395
Of course. it's those bums.

150
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:43.440
The park's invaded.

151
00:08:43.565 --> 00:08:44.816
Yes. it's very sad.

152
00:08:44.942 --> 00:08:47.361
But what can you do?
But it's not my fault!

153
00:08:53.992 --> 00:08:55.202
Cap. you sleeping?

154
00:08:55.327 --> 00:08:56.370
Yeah.

155
00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.455
Me neither.

156
00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.336
1000 bones!

157
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.463
Maybe more.

158
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:09.174
I can't believe it.

159
00:09:09.299 --> 00:09:10.592
Me neither.

160
00:09:11.093 --> 00:09:12.135
Me either.

161
00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:16.640
You not only sponge.
you eavesdrop at the door?

162
00:09:16.765 --> 00:09:19.434
The door's the wall of a tent.

163
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.769
No. but...

164
00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.856
It's the principle. man.

165
00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:25.607
OK? The principle!

166
00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:30.654
Anyway.

167
00:09:30.988 --> 00:09:32.656
thanks for your help. Arrow.

168
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:35.242
Don't worry. we'll pay back the 2 euros.

169
00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:36.952
G'night!

170
00:09:37.077 --> 00:09:39.037
Hold on. My 2 euros?

171
00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.748
You helped us out. we pay you back.

172
00:09:41.874 --> 00:09:44.042
It's normal.
We're not crooks.

173
00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:45.335
You scamming me?

174
00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.212
Captain?

175
00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:48.297
He scamming me?

176
00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:49.590
I don't think so.

177
00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:50.757
Twiggy?

178
00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:52.050
You scamming him?

179
00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:53.468
No way. why?

180
00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:57.306
Oh. you were really playing!

181
00:09:57.431 --> 00:09:58.974
He was playing for real!

182
00:09:59.099 --> 00:10:00.684
I didn't understand.

183
00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.728
Fine with me.
It's up to you.

184
00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:06.899
If you're OK with skimming
what we'd have won anyway.

185
00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:08.358
It's fine with me.

186
00:10:08.483 --> 00:10:09.943
It's your conscience.

187
00:10:11.153 --> 00:10:12.196
OK. I'm good.

188
00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:13.906
My conscience is down.

189
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:15.449
OK.

190
00:10:16.742 --> 00:10:17.868
Great!

191
00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:21.413
Let's not get carried away.

192
00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:23.248
We haven't won yet.

193
00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.709
It could just be a piece of paper.

194
00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:27.794
- OK?
- OK. pal!

195
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.421
I'm not your pal!

196
00:11:01.912 --> 00:11:03.080
Asshole!

197
00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:05.123
Asshole!

198
00:11:06.208 --> 00:11:08.293
Asshole! Get back here!

199
00:11:09.503 --> 00:11:10.838
Good doogie!

200
00:11:10.963 --> 00:11:12.130
That's my boy!

201
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:13.715
Asshole?

202
00:11:14.216 --> 00:11:15.551
Good Asshole!

203
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.190
I've been thinking.

204
00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:32.067
If we really did win.

205
00:11:32.693 --> 00:11:34.027
we'll say we lost.

206
00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:35.737
“We had the wrong draw.

207
00:11:35.863 --> 00:11:40.242
But I love your dog. Come back next Wednesday
and we'll play again.”

208
00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:42.077
Hold on.

209
00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:45.205
You have the ticket. right?

210
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.999
No. he has it.

211
00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:48.333
Of course.

212
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:50.711
He does.

213
00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:01.430
Do it however you want.

214
00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:03.682
get the ticket when I distract him.

215
00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:05.934
Wait. Are you serious?

216
00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:08.687
We can't do that.

217
00:12:09.188 --> 00:12:10.147
It's not fair.

218
00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:11.565
It's 1000 euros!

219
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.650
And they're our numbers!

220
00:12:15.027 --> 00:12:17.070
We play those numbers every week.

221
00:12:17.196 --> 00:12:19.865
We always lose.
He shows up and we win.

222
00:12:20.699 --> 00:12:22.326
He's a lucky charm.

223
00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.244
A lucky charm?

224
00:12:24.369 --> 00:12:25.329
Exactly.

225
00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:29.666
OK.

226
00:12:31.502 --> 00:12:34.213
But he takes his money and scrams.

227
00:12:34.338 --> 00:12:36.340
- Yeah.
- He doesn't stick around.

228
00:12:36.465 --> 00:12:38.217
- We're no shelter.
- No.

229
00:12:44.973 --> 00:12:48.310
No. that's right.
Four numbers and the joker.

230
00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:49.686
That's the jackpot.

231
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.146
Wait. Maybe.

232
00:12:51.605 --> 00:12:55.526
Could you re-recheck. again please?

233
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.320
Yi?

234
00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.031
Take your time.

235
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:17.548
What'd they say?

236
00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:19.591
Four numbers.

237
00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:23.220
17. 29. 36 and 45.

238
00:13:23.345 --> 00:13:24.346
The joker is 10.

239
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:27.599
See. that's impossible.
We don't play 45.

240
00:13:27.724 --> 00:13:31.562
We know our numbers. 9. 17. 29. 36. 54.

241
00:13:31.687 --> 00:13:33.480
Captain. do we play 45?

242
00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:35.232
- Nope.
- We don't play 45.

243
00:13:35.357 --> 00:13:36.984
Maybe it was a mistake.

244
00:13:37.109 --> 00:13:39.695
but that's what's on the ticket.

245
00:13:40.529 --> 00:13:42.865
Arrow. show me the ticket. please.

246
00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:51.456
I hid it good. I pegged you
as the type who'd swipe it.

247
00:13:56.295 --> 00:13:57.504
No!

248
00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:00.757
Check it yourself. please.

249
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.343
It's like you said.

250
00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.888
9. 17. 29. 36. 54...

251
00:14:06.013 --> 00:14:07.848
No. I marked the 45.

252
00:14:08.432 --> 00:14:09.892
My bad.

253
00:14:11.018 --> 00:14:12.227
What?

254
00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.355
- What?
- You idiot!

255
00:14:15.772 --> 00:14:18.859
Back off. fatso! It was a mistake!

256
00:14:18.984 --> 00:14:20.527
First time I played.

257
00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:22.112
Lemme explain.

258
00:14:22.237 --> 00:14:23.780
We won thanks to you.

259
00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:24.740
We won!

260
00:14:24.865 --> 00:14:27.159
Yi. how much. please?

261
00:14:27.284 --> 00:14:29.119
I can't tell you.

262
00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:30.954
I pay out small prizes.

263
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:32.581
Ask at the lotto office.

264
00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:36.210
But with four numbers and the joker.
it's 1 million.

265
00:14:36.335 --> 00:14:37.419
Maybe 2!

266
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:39.880
One million?

267
00:14:40.005 --> 00:14:41.131
Maybe 2?

268
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:42.466
Maybe.

269
00:14:43.926 --> 00:14:45.469
So. Yi...

270
00:14:46.053 --> 00:14:49.515
Could you front us some cash for the subway?

271
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.099
Alright. How much?

272
00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:52.226
Well...

273
00:14:52.976 --> 00:14:53.977
I dunno.

274
00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:56.688
12 bottles! A round for everyone!

275
00:15:06.073 --> 00:15:09.117
Ladies and gentlemen. good day!

276
00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:10.410
Hello!

277
00:15:10.536 --> 00:15:13.080
My friends and I.

278
00:15:13.205 --> 00:15:17.125
will pass through the wagon
to give you each some change

279
00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:19.920
or even a smoke if you're interested.

280
00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:22.089
- Who won a million?
- Maybe 2!

281
00:15:22.214 --> 00:15:23.549
Hurray!

282
00:15:23.674 --> 00:15:25.801
Millionaire! Millionaire!

283
00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:28.470
Hello. do you want cigarette?

284
00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:34.142
We won a million!
We won a million!

285
00:15:34.268 --> 00:15:36.270
224.684 euros.

286
00:15:36.395 --> 00:15:37.813
Congratulations!

287
00:15:40.357 --> 00:15:41.817
Could you check again?

288
00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:45.320
Mr Yi said told us we won a million euros.

289
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.405
Maybe 2!

290
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:47.531
Maybe!

291
00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:48.949
No. I'm...

292
00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:50.325
That's right.

293
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.995
It's divided among the winners.

294
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.956
There are 15 tickets with your numbers.

295
00:15:56.081 --> 00:15:58.500
Which makes 224.684 euros.

296
00:16:00.294 --> 00:16:01.837
A tidy sum. no?

297
00:16:02.504 --> 00:16:03.463
Yeah.

298
00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:04.548
Yeah!

299
00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:08.594
224 thou!

300
00:16:15.976 --> 00:16:17.060
That's alright.

301
00:16:17.186 --> 00:16:19.479
Bravo! Let's finalize things...

302
00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:20.564
Yes!

303
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:22.107
I have the ticket.

304
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.903
I need the winners' bank details and IDs.

305
00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:27.279
Bank accounts?

306
00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:28.739
An ID card?

307
00:16:28.864 --> 00:16:29.823
The winners?

308
00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:33.118
Or I can give you a check.
but I need your ID.

309
00:16:34.453 --> 00:16:35.537
You don't have ID?

310
00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:36.830
Yeah. I do!

311
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:38.290
No?

312
00:16:38.582 --> 00:16:39.541
You. no?

313
00:16:40.292 --> 00:16:41.251
No.

314
00:16:41.376 --> 00:16:42.336
Well...

315
00:16:43.045 --> 00:16:44.087
Not on us. anyway.

316
00:16:44.463 --> 00:16:45.464
Or anywhere.

317
00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:46.590
Right.

318
00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:48.425
No worries. I have mine.

319
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.303
But can you divide it into three payments?

320
00:16:51.428 --> 00:16:53.847
- We're not together.
- To avoid bad vibes.

321
00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:57.684
I can only make you a check if you have ID.

322
00:16:57.809 --> 00:16:58.936
You understand?

323
00:17:02.147 --> 00:17:03.315
No. I can't...

324
00:17:03.982 --> 00:17:07.194
write a check without proof that you're you.

325
00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:13.367
But you have proof it's them.
They're standing in front of you.

326
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:16.286
Is she slow?

327
00:17:19.957 --> 00:17:21.165
Make it out to him.

328
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.501
Great.

329
00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:26.463
Be right back.

330
00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:28.841
Stay there. I'll be back.

331
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.066
Good.

332
00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.442
So...

333
00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:49.736
Is it sinking in?

334
00:17:49.862 --> 00:17:52.239
Yeah. For sure...

335
00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:54.658
No. Actually. not at all.

336
00:17:55.409 --> 00:17:57.327
That's perfectly normal.

337
00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.204
We advise winners

338
00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:02.249
not to alter their daily routines.

339
00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:08.422
At first. I mean.

340
00:18:08.547 --> 00:18:10.007
My card.

341
00:18:10.132 --> 00:18:12.593
If you have any questions. just call.

342
00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:15.220
The pamphlet's very helpful.

343
00:18:15.345 --> 00:18:16.722
It's for big winners.

344
00:18:16.847 --> 00:18:21.018
But there are tips
you might find helpful...

345
00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:25.314
Nasty apple.

346
00:18:25.439 --> 00:18:26.773
It's polystyrene.

347
00:18:26.899 --> 00:18:27.983
Yeah?

348
00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:29.401
Still. it's nasty.

349
00:18:35.949 --> 00:18:36.992
Alright...

350
00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.535
Here's your check.

351
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.621
The pièce de résistance!

352
00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:46.502
So then...
you are Mr Francis Courtass?

353
00:18:46.627 --> 00:18:48.629
Courta... The ending is silent.

354
00:18:51.089 --> 00:18:52.883
Francis Courtass?

355
00:18:53.008 --> 00:18:54.384
Courta. It's silent.

356
00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:56.553
Courta!

357
00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:58.180
Piss off. Not funny.

358
00:18:58.305 --> 00:19:00.349
Francis is bad enough!

359
00:19:00.474 --> 00:19:02.392
It's short for Francisco.

360
00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:03.810
It's Spanish!

361
00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:05.771
Stop!

362
00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:08.524
Sorry. Forgive me.

363
00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:10.234
It's the emotion.

364
00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:23.080
Where do we go with 220.000 euros?

365
00:19:23.205 --> 00:19:24.331
It's unreal.

366
00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:26.083
We go to the bank.

367
00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:27.251
Courtass?

368
00:19:27.376 --> 00:19:30.170
- Courta!
- Ta! Ta! Sorry!

369
00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:31.505
Where's your bank?

370
00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:35.175
Do I look like I have a bank?
This is for banks!

371
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.511
Wait. I had a bank book
back home.

372
00:19:37.803 --> 00:19:42.057
I'm from Angers. But when I was five.
they sent me to Mulhouse and...

373
00:19:42.182 --> 00:19:43.350
Zip it!

374
00:19:44.017 --> 00:19:47.646
On the street.
it's like in an American crime show...

375
00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:51.149
- Anything you say...
- May be used against you!

376
00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:54.862
You don't know my bank.
And I have the check.

377
00:19:55.404 --> 00:19:56.363
Good luck!

378
00:19:56.488 --> 00:19:58.365
No worries. we'll find a bank.

379
00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.534
Who'd refuse a 220.000 euro check?

380
00:20:00.659 --> 00:20:04.204
From now on. we don't let him
out of our sight.

381
00:20:04.329 --> 00:20:07.082
He doesn't pee alone till we get our cut.

382
00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:10.043
- I heard that.
- I know. Now you know.

383
00:20:12.212 --> 00:20:13.297
Nice dude!

384
00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:16.592
Remember.
you won 70.000 thanks to me.

385
00:20:16.717 --> 00:20:17.885
Thanks. Francis.

386
00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.052
Welcome. pal.

387
00:20:19.178 --> 00:20:20.179
I'm not your pal.

388
00:20:23.891 --> 00:20:26.185
I'm afraid it's complicated.

389
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.562
The bank has two requirements.

390
00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:31.523
First. you need ID.
which I have for him.

391
00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:35.277
The second is proof of address.

392
00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:36.653
Yes. but...

393
00:20:36.778 --> 00:20:38.780
That's how it is. It's the law.

394
00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:39.907
It's absurd.

395
00:20:40.032 --> 00:20:41.033
You realize...

396
00:20:41.158 --> 00:20:42.743
Yes. I do realize.

397
00:20:42.868 --> 00:20:44.536
Absurd. but it's the law.

398
00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:46.038
Let's try another bank.

399
00:20:46.163 --> 00:20:47.206
It'll be the same.

400
00:20:47.331 --> 00:20:49.208
Oh yeah? Wanna bet?

401
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:57.841
Asshole. hurry up!

402
00:20:57.966 --> 00:21:00.969
Maybe online banks are less strict.

403
00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:02.429
It's unlikely.

404
00:21:02.554 --> 00:21:06.016
But if I've understood
your situation correctly.

405
00:21:06.141 --> 00:21:11.772
Mr Courtass won't be able
to give you 70.000 euros in cash.

406
00:21:11.897 --> 00:21:15.400
You need a bank account.
and thus proof of address

407
00:21:15.526 --> 00:21:17.569
and an ID card. of course.

408
00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.155
Here's your check.

409
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.406
Asshole!

410
00:21:27.204 --> 00:21:29.373
There's a procedure to renting.

411
00:21:29.498 --> 00:21:33.544
You need to create a file.
the landlord has to consent.

412
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:35.963
Even with a great credit rating.

413
00:21:36.088 --> 00:21:37.881
applications may be refused.

414
00:21:38.006 --> 00:21:39.091
Alright. fine.

415
00:21:39.216 --> 00:21:40.384
If we can't rent.

416
00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:41.969
we can buy. Right?

417
00:21:42.094 --> 00:21:43.595
What's 220.000 get us?

418
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.847
With a pool.

419
00:21:44.972 --> 00:21:47.182
I don't have one with a pool.

420
00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:48.892
We're not that picky.

421
00:21:49.393 --> 00:21:50.894
We'll take a garage.

422
00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.438
We don't rent garages. Sorry.

423
00:21:53.564 --> 00:21:54.356
Bitch!

424
00:21:54.481 --> 00:21:55.440
Excuse me?

425
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.284
So. to replace your papers.

426
00:22:05.409 --> 00:22:07.452
it's quick and easy.

427
00:22:07.578 --> 00:22:10.831
You just need a declaration of loss or theft.

428
00:22:10.956 --> 00:22:14.585
You come back with two official photographs

429
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:18.589
three-months' proof of residency
and a birth certificate.

430
00:22:18.714 --> 00:22:21.091
So. for your birth certificate.

431
00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:23.218
it's quick and easy.

432
00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:28.891
You can request it online
at public-service.fr.

433
00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:30.100
Hyphen!

434
00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:33.687
No need to request it
in your place of birth.

435
00:22:35.647 --> 00:22:37.316
For foreign citizens.

436
00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:38.317
it's...

437
00:22:38.442 --> 00:22:39.526
Quick and easy?

438
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:42.654
Horribly complicated.

439
00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:44.406
Next!

440
00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:46.366
Young man. sorry to bother you.

441
00:22:46.491 --> 00:22:48.368
Would you have some change?

442
00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:50.245
You won't believe it.

443
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:53.207
See. my friends and I won the lottery.

444
00:22:53.332 --> 00:22:55.834
But we can't cash the check.

445
00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:57.044
- Here.
- Thanks!

446
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:59.421
I'm not sure I understand.

447
00:22:59.755 --> 00:23:04.009
You want me to give you 220.000 euros
in cash for your check?

448
00:23:04.134 --> 00:23:09.097
If you like. you can even take
a small commission. We're not...

449
00:23:09.223 --> 00:23:10.933
You'll have to leave.

450
00:23:16.897 --> 00:23:18.899
Can we use the bathroom?

451
00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:21.485
Look. what I think is...

452
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:22.986
Your 220.000 euros...

453
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:24.613
- You can...
- Shove them.

454
00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:25.989
It's quick and easy.

455
00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:36.333
Could you shut up for a minute?
I can't think. Courtass.

456
00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:37.876
Courta! Courta!

457
00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:40.212
Next time. I'll slug you. fatso!

458
00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:42.673
Slug me? I'd love to see that!

459
00:23:42.798 --> 00:23:44.842
Enough. It's over!

460
00:23:44.967 --> 00:23:46.176
Zip it!

461
00:23:47.594 --> 00:23:48.720
You little runt!

462
00:23:49.012 --> 00:23:52.391
It was fun while it lasted.
But enough's enough.

463
00:23:52.516 --> 00:23:54.184
Let's get back to reality.

464
00:23:54.309 --> 00:23:56.270
Wait. what's over?

465
00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:58.355
Everything.

466
00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:03.193
The banks. rental agencies.
the cavalry. the lottery...

467
00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:06.321
We stop. At first. yes. it was fun.

468
00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:09.074
But I'm throwing in my cap.

469
00:24:09.908 --> 00:24:11.743
Come on. Captain!

470
00:24:12.536 --> 00:24:13.912
You're not serious.

471
00:24:14.037 --> 00:24:15.330
You're just tired.

472
00:24:15.455 --> 00:24:16.331
Me too.

473
00:24:16.456 --> 00:24:17.541
We're all tired.

474
00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:18.709
I'm not tired.

475
00:24:18.834 --> 00:24:21.461
I'm too old to tramp
from office to office

476
00:24:21.587 --> 00:24:24.131
to see people
who can't help us. “Next!”

477
00:24:24.256 --> 00:24:27.801
We'll find a solution.
There's gotta be one!

478
00:24:27.926 --> 00:24:30.304
There's no solution for our kind.

479
00:24:30.721 --> 00:24:33.807
How often have you tried
to get off the street?

480
00:24:33.932 --> 00:24:35.851
And how often did you fail?

481
00:24:35.976 --> 00:24:38.645
So let me tell you both something.

482
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.732
Your ticket. your check you can't cash...

483
00:24:41.857 --> 00:24:43.942
You can keep it. alright?

484
00:24:44.401 --> 00:24:47.070
You can even split my share.

485
00:24:47.696 --> 00:24:48.655
Lord!

486
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.199
- Stop.
- I've had it.

487
00:24:50.324 --> 00:24:52.492
- Captain. please!
- Screw it!

488
00:24:52.618 --> 00:24:54.244
Right. Captain. please!

489
00:24:54.369 --> 00:24:55.537
Come on. Captain!

490
00:24:55.662 --> 00:24:56.914
It's fine.

491
00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:58.332
So. we go 50-50?

492
00:24:58.457 --> 00:24:59.958
Shut up. Courtass!

493
00:25:00.083 --> 00:25:01.293
Ninja!

494
00:25:05.589 --> 00:25:07.257
Help! I can't swim!

495
00:25:07.758 --> 00:25:10.385
It's your fault.
you pushed me!

496
00:25:10.844 --> 00:25:11.887
Hold on.

497
00:25:12.971 --> 00:25:14.181
I can stand.

498
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.016
Yeah. sure.

499
00:25:16.141 --> 00:25:17.768
Go ahead and laugh.

500
00:25:18.393 --> 00:25:19.895
Real funny.

501
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:21.855
The water's up to his crotch!

502
00:25:22.481 --> 00:25:23.941
Shit. the check!

503
00:25:24.066 --> 00:25:25.108
Get out of there!

504
00:25:25.234 --> 00:25:26.568
I have the check!

505
00:25:27.986 --> 00:25:29.655
Who's laughing now?

506
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.406
Me!

507
00:25:55.222 --> 00:25:56.431
Sugar?

508
00:25:57.099 --> 00:25:58.100
Thanks.

509
00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:02.813
I didn't realize.

510
00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.315
I'm so sorry.

511
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.068
I never thought...

512
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.237
I don't know what to say.

513
00:26:10.362 --> 00:26:12.489
It's all the fault off Twiggy.

514
00:26:12.614 --> 00:26:14.116
It's the fault of Twiggy.

515
00:26:14.241 --> 00:26:16.785
See. Cap agrees.
If you haven't shoved me...

516
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.287
Hadn't shoved me!

517
00:26:18.412 --> 00:26:19.580
So what?

518
00:26:20.247 --> 00:26:21.206
Really!

519
00:26:22.875 --> 00:26:24.334
The check's not a problem.

520
00:26:24.459 --> 00:26:26.837
I can replace it. it's no problem.

521
00:26:26.962 --> 00:26:29.590
But I was thinking. Mr Courtass...

522
00:26:29.715 --> 00:26:33.844
Perhaps your parents could declare
you live with them.

523
00:26:33.969 --> 00:26:37.306
You could open a bank account.
the same day.

524
00:26:37.681 --> 00:26:38.682
- Francis?
- Yes.

525
00:26:38.807 --> 00:26:40.184
We gotta cash the check.

526
00:26:40.475 --> 00:26:41.810
OK. but without them.

527
00:26:41.935 --> 00:26:43.896
It's a chance to reconnect.

528
00:26:44.021 --> 00:26:47.065
I've seen Lotto's magic work wonders.

529
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:49.151
Thanks to Lotto. some people...

530
00:26:49.276 --> 00:26:52.362
My parents are dead. So reconnecting...

531
00:26:52.487 --> 00:26:54.656
It'd take a lotta Lotto magic.

532
00:26:55.616 --> 00:26:58.285
I see. I'm very sorry.

533
00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.953
Nah. I never knew them.

534
00:27:00.078 --> 00:27:03.123
Well. four months. Car accident. Dead!

535
00:27:03.498 --> 00:27:04.917
My gran raised me.

536
00:27:05.959 --> 00:27:07.252
But she's dead too.

537
00:27:10.797 --> 00:27:12.883
I was one. I don't remember her.

538
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:18.889
Is anyone still alive in your family.
aside from you?

539
00:27:19.515 --> 00:27:20.516
Nope.

540
00:27:24.311 --> 00:27:25.479
- Bye.
- Bye. thanks.

541
00:27:27.314 --> 00:27:28.649
I'm on the case.

542
00:27:47.417 --> 00:27:49.127
The kid's a poet.

543
00:27:49.878 --> 00:27:51.713
A poet
who doesn't know it.

544
00:27:51.839 --> 00:27:53.340
I swear. he's a genius.

545
00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:54.842
Look at him.

546
00:28:01.557 --> 00:28:04.434
“Life isn't waiting for storms to pass.

547
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.854
It's learning to dance in the rain.”

548
00:28:08.146 --> 00:28:10.440
Would we go dancing in the rain?

549
00:28:13.318 --> 00:28:14.653
Not in my undies!

550
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:32.379
It's a friendly building.

551
00:28:32.504 --> 00:28:34.047
with nearby shopping.

552
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.716
the metro...

553
00:28:35.841 --> 00:28:39.219
There are two bedrooms.
and a sofa bed in here.

554
00:28:40.304 --> 00:28:42.639
- Western exposure...
- Kinda sketchy.

555
00:28:42.764 --> 00:28:45.350
You said the owner won bigtime.

556
00:28:45.893 --> 00:28:49.521
His late mom lived here.
He's still attached to the place.

557
00:28:49.646 --> 00:28:51.315
He didn't need to sell.

558
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.399
If I may.

559
00:28:52.524 --> 00:28:54.276
how much did the guy win?

560
00:28:54.401 --> 00:28:55.444
16 million.

561
00:28:55.944 --> 00:28:57.863
Yeah. that's decent too.

562
00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.451
Know a winner

563
00:29:02.576 --> 00:29:07.039
who bought his mom a villa with a pool
just before she died?

564
00:29:07.831 --> 00:29:09.833
Sorry. I don't.

565
00:29:10.459 --> 00:29:12.252
- Magnificent!
- You like it?

566
00:29:12.377 --> 00:29:14.922
Way better than
what we imagined. right?

567
00:29:15.547 --> 00:29:17.466
No. in fact I was saying...

568
00:29:20.052 --> 00:29:22.304
I can't thank you enough.

569
00:29:22.429 --> 00:29:24.932
Thank Mr Dumesnil. your landlord.

570
00:29:25.057 --> 00:29:26.517
I'm just the go-between.

571
00:29:26.642 --> 00:29:30.395
I'd ask only you respect
the building and neighbors.

572
00:29:30.521 --> 00:29:33.273
No problem. we'll be super careful.

573
00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:35.776
My bad.

574
00:29:37.528 --> 00:29:39.363
It's temporary. right?

575
00:29:39.488 --> 00:29:41.281
Soon as we get our papers

576
00:29:41.406 --> 00:29:43.075
and divvy up the money.

577
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.868
- we're gone!
- OK.

578
00:29:45.369 --> 00:29:46.870
So. then...

579
00:29:47.579 --> 00:29:52.584
Here are the lease in Mr Courtass's name
and Mr Dumesnil's attestation.

580
00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:56.213
Take them to the bank
and you can open an account.

581
00:29:58.215 --> 00:30:00.509
Here are the keys. You're home.

582
00:30:01.718 --> 00:30:02.970
We're home!

583
00:30:17.526 --> 00:30:19.194
You're taking all that?

584
00:30:19.319 --> 00:30:20.654
Yeah. I need it.

585
00:30:21.363 --> 00:30:23.407
- Is that all for you?
- Yeah.

586
00:30:23.532 --> 00:30:25.367
The essentials. It's all here.

587
00:30:26.368 --> 00:30:27.786
It's not easy.

588
00:30:28.453 --> 00:30:30.205
I built it all myself.

589
00:30:30.706 --> 00:30:33.292
C'mon. Crapper.
It's just wood and plastic.

590
00:30:34.209 --> 00:30:35.169
Captain?

591
00:30:36.587 --> 00:30:38.088
We're done here.

592
00:30:46.889 --> 00:30:48.307
It's your chance.

593
00:30:48.432 --> 00:30:49.474
Grab it.

594
00:30:50.934 --> 00:30:53.395
Look after him. OK?

595
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.605
Promise.

596
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.941
Don't you cry.
It's hard enough for him.

597
00:30:58.066 --> 00:30:59.568
I won't.

598
00:31:00.861 --> 00:31:02.946
Drop that.

599
00:31:04.281 --> 00:31:05.365
C'mere!

600
00:31:06.241 --> 00:31:08.243
So Vénus is his babe?

601
00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:10.829
No. she's the girl of his dreams!

602
00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:14.750
Really? I thought she was a hooker.

603
00:31:15.626 --> 00:31:16.960
She is a hooker.

604
00:31:20.464 --> 00:31:21.548
Does Cap know?

605
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:24.384
It's obvious. no?

606
00:31:27.888 --> 00:31:30.224
Cool dude. I couldn't take that.

607
00:31:30.349 --> 00:31:33.185
He doesn't care. he's in the band.

608
00:31:36.605 --> 00:31:38.440
He plays the flute.

609
00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:44.071
He plays the flute.

610
00:31:46.156 --> 00:31:47.741
I get it.

611
00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:51.203
Enough. get going. Clear out!

612
00:31:51.828 --> 00:31:53.664
Enough of you bums!

613
00:31:54.164 --> 00:31:56.917
You can't take all that.
Leave some here.

614
00:31:57.751 --> 00:31:59.169
- Alright.
- C'mon.

615
00:32:03.924 --> 00:32:04.883
You first.

616
00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:10.472
Go on.

617
00:32:10.931 --> 00:32:13.392
Don't worry. I won't miss you.

618
00:32:14.142 --> 00:32:15.602
Good riddance!

619
00:32:17.855 --> 00:32:19.731
We said no crying. Vénus.

620
00:32:19.857 --> 00:32:20.774
I'm not.

621
00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:22.776
They're tears of joy.

622
00:32:35.664 --> 00:32:37.332
You'll be happy here. Captain.

623
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:42.129
What is it?

624
00:32:43.755 --> 00:32:44.756
Do you hear?

625
00:32:46.091 --> 00:32:46.967
No.

626
00:32:48.343 --> 00:32:49.303
What?

627
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.096
Nothing.

628
00:32:53.307 --> 00:32:54.641
You hear nothing.

629
00:33:06.445 --> 00:33:08.113
Stop. Asshole. Sit!

630
00:33:08.488 --> 00:33:09.573
Francis!

631
00:33:16.079 --> 00:33:17.706
- What's going on?
- Shh!

632
00:33:22.252 --> 00:33:23.712
We're enjoying silence.

633
00:35:33.217 --> 00:35:34.051
Asshole. no!

634
00:35:35.552 --> 00:35:36.929
What's wrong?

635
00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:39.056
Why are you there?

636
00:35:39.181 --> 00:35:40.182
No idea.

637
00:35:40.307 --> 00:35:41.517
I can't remember.

638
00:35:44.102 --> 00:35:48.273
I think I have a clue.

639
00:36:01.286 --> 00:36:02.496
No. Asshole!

640
00:36:03.038 --> 00:36:04.206
Francis!

641
00:36:05.457 --> 00:36:06.667
What's wrong!

642
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:09.753
Go back to your room. man.

643
00:36:09.878 --> 00:36:10.963
Hold on.

644
00:36:11.213 --> 00:36:13.966
You call me to say
to go to my room?

645
00:36:14.091 --> 00:36:15.634
I know you're dumb. but...

646
00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:19.721
We're gonna have to get
a few things straight.

647
00:36:19.847 --> 00:36:24.184
You probably don't know
about apartment living.

648
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:26.186
and your mutt either. But...

649
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:28.397
You can't walk around naked!

650
00:36:29.481 --> 00:36:30.482
Cool it!

651
00:36:30.607 --> 00:36:32.901
If I sleep nakie. it's my business.

652
00:36:33.193 --> 00:36:36.280
In garages or malls. OK.
but this is my crib.

653
00:36:36.405 --> 00:36:38.740
No. it's not your crib. it's our crib.

654
00:36:40.242 --> 00:36:41.535
Damn. I looked.

655
00:36:41.869 --> 00:36:45.205
I have no problem with you sleeping nakie.

656
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:48.834
Or doing your thing... to the max!

657
00:36:48.959 --> 00:36:52.296
But when you leave your room.
put on some undies.

658
00:36:52.421 --> 00:36:53.922
Undies?

659
00:36:54.047 --> 00:36:55.048
Undies.

660
00:36:55.174 --> 00:36:56.550
Boxers. Francis!

661
00:36:57.593 --> 00:37:00.721
Ok. Undies. “Boxers. Francis!”

662
00:37:00.846 --> 00:37:01.972
OK. got it.

663
00:37:02.097 --> 00:37:03.140
Sorry.

664
00:37:03.265 --> 00:37:04.266
Thank you.

665
00:37:08.937 --> 00:37:11.273
Christ. put on some undies!

666
00:37:14.276 --> 00:37:15.360
Gentlemen.

667
00:37:16.403 --> 00:37:17.446
a gift!

668
00:37:18.197 --> 00:37:19.281
Shit!

669
00:37:19.406 --> 00:37:20.657
Thanks. awesome!

670
00:37:20.782 --> 00:37:22.367
Just what I needed.

671
00:37:22.492 --> 00:37:24.453
Calm down. it was your dough.

672
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:27.623
They're not supersonic. but we have 4G.

673
00:37:27.748 --> 00:37:29.416
What's it for?

674
00:37:30.334 --> 00:37:31.376
To call people.

675
00:37:31.752 --> 00:37:33.795
Dude. you been living in a cave?

676
00:37:34.505 --> 00:37:37.007
Captain. it's on the Internet now.

677
00:37:37.508 --> 00:37:40.385
We can keep an eye on each other.

678
00:37:40.511 --> 00:37:44.806
Know where we are. what we're up to.
when we're coming home.

679
00:37:44.932 --> 00:37:45.933
Like normal people.

680
00:37:46.058 --> 00:37:48.060
Like normal people. got it.

681
00:37:48.477 --> 00:37:49.520
For the flat.

682
00:37:49.645 --> 00:37:52.856
we should divvy up the chores.

683
00:37:53.148 --> 00:37:54.316
Arrow...

684
00:37:54.441 --> 00:37:55.484
Arrow!

685
00:37:55.817 --> 00:37:58.278
- Sorry.
- We each do our part.

686
00:37:58.612 --> 00:38:00.864
If Cap takes out the trash.

687
00:38:00.989 --> 00:38:03.951
someone else cooks
and the other cleans up.

688
00:38:04.076 --> 00:38:05.035
Who?

689
00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:07.079
Who what?

690
00:38:07.663 --> 00:38:08.830
Who cooks?

691
00:38:08.956 --> 00:38:10.791
You said Cap takes the trash.

692
00:38:10.916 --> 00:38:12.501
So who cooks. you or me?

693
00:38:12.626 --> 00:38:14.378
Cuz I haven't cooked since...

694
00:38:15.462 --> 00:38:16.463
social services.

695
00:38:17.005 --> 00:38:19.216
Like the four-quarters cake...

696
00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:21.343
I know it's ¼. ¼. ¼...

697
00:38:22.511 --> 00:38:23.554
but ¼ of what?

698
00:38:23.679 --> 00:38:24.972
You're missing one.

699
00:38:25.097 --> 00:38:27.683
That's three. a three-thirds cake.

700
00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.352
Four-fourths. not three-thirds.

701
00:38:30.477 --> 00:38:31.812
That's my point.

702
00:38:31.937 --> 00:38:32.980
Hey. guys?

703
00:38:33.647 --> 00:38:36.358
Enough with the fractions.

704
00:38:36.483 --> 00:38:38.151
However long we're here.

705
00:38:38.277 --> 00:38:39.945
I want cooperation.

706
00:38:41.738 --> 00:38:43.115
We're not stupid.

707
00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.993
No need for a masterclass in coop living.

708
00:38:46.118 --> 00:38:47.077
C'mon.

709
00:38:47.202 --> 00:38:49.872
We've survived so far. we'll manage.

710
00:38:49.997 --> 00:38:51.915
I wasn't talking to you.

711
00:38:52.541 --> 00:38:53.500
Arrow.

712
00:38:54.585 --> 00:38:57.129
this here's the cash box.

713
00:38:59.173 --> 00:39:01.508
You put money in it.

714
00:39:01.633 --> 00:39:04.261
Regularly.
Don't screw up.

715
00:39:04.887 --> 00:39:06.847
And... Oh yeah!

716
00:39:06.972 --> 00:39:09.057
I'll make us a budget.

717
00:39:09.183 --> 00:39:11.226
Until we split the prize.

718
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:14.980
we buy the strict minimum.
and we keep records.

719
00:39:15.105 --> 00:39:16.690
- CDs?
- Of expenses!

720
00:39:16.815 --> 00:39:20.402
Jesus H Christ to goddamn holy hell!

721
00:39:21.111 --> 00:39:22.779
Want a coffee. Twiggy. or...

722
00:39:22.905 --> 00:39:24.031
Are you OK?

723
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:43.300
Why are you tailing me?
What's your problem?

724
00:39:43.425 --> 00:39:45.886
- I'm gonna pay for this.
- That. too.

725
00:39:46.011 --> 00:39:48.805
Don't I pay at the cash?
This isn't the cash!

726
00:39:48.931 --> 00:39:50.933
I'll pay for your shit!

727
00:39:54.102 --> 00:39:55.812
No. you calm down.

728
00:39:55.938 --> 00:39:57.022
Arrow. it's OK.

729
00:39:57.147 --> 00:39:58.690
I'm watching you.

730
00:39:58.815 --> 00:39:59.816
We'll pay. sir.

731
00:39:59.942 --> 00:40:01.443
I'm loaded.

732
00:40:06.823 --> 00:40:08.075
Really. Francis!

733
00:40:09.993 --> 00:40:11.745
Sure you need this?

734
00:40:12.454 --> 00:40:13.622
Yeah.

735
00:40:13.747 --> 00:40:16.834
There's no bulb in my room.
And I love raclette.

736
00:40:17.376 --> 00:40:19.378
Look. it makes pancakes. too.

737
00:40:19.503 --> 00:40:20.754
It's reversible.

738
00:40:21.338 --> 00:40:22.923
- Smart. huh?
- Captain!

739
00:40:23.048 --> 00:40:25.217
- Yeah?
- Say something. please!

740
00:40:25.968 --> 00:40:27.970
Well. if it makes him happy...

741
00:40:28.095 --> 00:40:29.847
I mean. we owe him.

742
00:40:31.348 --> 00:40:32.641
Live it up.

743
00:40:35.269 --> 00:40:36.645
I am living it up.

744
00:40:37.396 --> 00:40:39.147
I'm living it up sick.

745
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.043
Yeah?

746
00:41:41.335 --> 00:41:43.629
20 minutes. Time's up.

747
00:41:43.754 --> 00:41:46.131
Leave us some hot water. too!

748
00:41:46.256 --> 00:41:47.716
Almost done.

749
00:41:50.886 --> 00:41:52.304
What's taking you?

750
00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:54.556
Tough. I'm coming in.

751
00:42:00.145 --> 00:42:01.522
What's that mug?

752
00:42:04.775 --> 00:42:05.734
Hey. Captain?

753
00:42:06.818 --> 00:42:08.946

I did not understand.

00:42:41.937 --> 00:42:43.397
Please start over.

767
00:42:43.522 --> 00:42:47.025

775

Fuck!

776
00:43:07.421 --> 00:43:08.547
Careful.

777
00:43:12.509 --> 00:43:13.969
I can't pay her.

778
00:43:14.094 --> 00:43:16.054
- Sleep with her.
- She's 75!

779
00:43:16.555 --> 00:43:17.556
So?

780
00:43:19.558 --> 00:43:20.809
Presents.

781
00:43:21.185 --> 00:43:22.394
Really?

782
00:43:23.896 --> 00:43:24.980
Thanks.

783
00:43:25.105 --> 00:43:26.690
- Can we?
- Go for it.

784
00:43:34.448 --> 00:43:35.407
A branch?

785
00:43:35.532 --> 00:43:37.993
No! It's a twig! Like your nick!

786
00:43:38.118 --> 00:43:40.787
But this one is dipped in bronze.

787
00:43:40.913 --> 00:43:42.456
Guy said it won't rot.

788
00:43:42.581 --> 00:43:43.790
Must've cost a mint.

789
00:43:43.916 --> 00:43:46.502
For real.
It's a gift. On me.

790
00:43:46.627 --> 00:43:48.378
I'm happy to make you happy.

791
00:43:49.588 --> 00:43:53.342
If mine's a bronze cap.
they really screwed up.

792
00:43:55.802 --> 00:43:58.096
Here goes. let's see.

793
00:44:02.434 --> 00:44:03.769
A flute!

794
00:44:04.811 --> 00:44:05.771
Like it?

795
00:44:06.104 --> 00:44:07.439
Sure. Thanks. Arrow.

796
00:44:07.564 --> 00:44:09.024
A lovely surprise.

797
00:44:11.777 --> 00:44:12.736
Well. play.

798
00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:14.488
- I can't.
- Course you can!

799
00:44:14.613 --> 00:44:16.156
- Twiggy said so.
- Did not!

800
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:17.658
I didn't know you play.

801
00:44:17.783 --> 00:44:18.909
I don't.

802
00:44:19.034 --> 00:44:22.037
He said you were in a band or something.

803
00:44:26.708 --> 00:44:28.377
I said you play the flute.

804
00:44:30.504 --> 00:44:31.713
Arrow!

805
00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:33.674
Françis. it's an expression.

806
00:44:33.799 --> 00:44:35.384
Like if I said.

807
00:44:35.509 --> 00:44:37.344
he's on the other team.

808
00:44:39.429 --> 00:44:41.807
Speak French. I never understand you.

809
00:44:41.932 --> 00:44:46.603
Francis. it's an expression
for men who like men.

810
00:44:47.271 --> 00:44:48.939
What do you kids say?

811
00:44:49.064 --> 00:44:50.107
A fag?

812
00:44:53.151 --> 00:44:54.236
You're a fag?

813
00:44:59.074 --> 00:45:00.200
I'm shook.

814
00:45:08.417 --> 00:45:09.585
I'm shook.

815
00:45:29.897 --> 00:45:30.939
Hello.

816
00:45:31.064 --> 00:45:32.399
Hello.

817
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:37.196
Twiky. Kapten. Aro. Ashole
6th floor

818
00:45:37.321 --> 00:45:41.700
Dijon's not too big.
population 150.000. it's very pleasant.

819
00:45:48.081 --> 00:45:49.875
- Good night.
- Good night.

820
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:58.759
If they're yelling at 10 again.
I'll call the cops.

821
00:45:58.884 --> 00:45:59.760
Tell them!

822
00:45:59.885 --> 00:46:01.929
Hello!

823
00:46:04.806 --> 00:46:06.683
You look fantastic!

824
00:46:06.808 --> 00:46:07.809
We're swank.

825
00:46:07.935 --> 00:46:09.478
Wankers. you mean?

826
00:46:09.603 --> 00:46:11.021
Come in. come in!

827
00:46:11.146 --> 00:46:12.105
Why. Twiggy!

828
00:46:12.981 --> 00:46:15.567
This is Nicolas Grenier.

829
00:46:16.026 --> 00:46:17.778
Nicolas Grenier? Seriously?

830
00:46:17.903 --> 00:46:19.071
So. Nick?

831
00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:21.657
What am I getting for Christmas?

832
00:46:24.618 --> 00:46:25.577
No?

833
00:46:26.453 --> 00:46:28.163
This is Mr Dumesnil.

834
00:46:28.288 --> 00:46:29.790
your kind landlord.

835
00:46:29.915 --> 00:46:30.958
- Francis...
- Yo.

836
00:46:31.083 --> 00:46:32.709
- Nicolas.
- Hello.

837
00:46:32.835 --> 00:46:34.419
- And Captain.
- A pleasure.

838
00:46:34.545 --> 00:46:35.504
Hello.

839
00:46:35.629 --> 00:46:39.091
May I introduce Thérèse and Yi.
our friends. and...

840
00:46:39.216 --> 00:46:41.426
Vénus. the woman of my dreams.

841
00:46:43.595 --> 00:46:44.555
A pleasure.

842
00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.681
Great.

843
00:46:45.806 --> 00:46:48.100
- Put this on ice.
- Very kind!

844
00:46:48.892 --> 00:46:52.104
Sorry. forgive me. Welcome to your home!

845
00:46:52.229 --> 00:46:53.397
Come in. come in.

846
00:46:57.067 --> 00:47:00.028
Just as we're leaving.
Captain turns and asks.

847
00:47:00.279 --> 00:47:02.406
“Can we use the bathroom?”

848
00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:08.078
Shit!

849
00:47:08.203 --> 00:47:10.247
Wait. I'll show you. Thérèse...

850
00:47:16.795 --> 00:47:18.505
How's it working out?

851
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:20.174
It's good.

852
00:47:20.632 --> 00:47:23.051
Ups and downs. but we'll manage.

853
00:47:23.552 --> 00:47:24.595
I'm sure.

854
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.888
Good vibes here.

855
00:47:26.013 --> 00:47:28.390
Mom and I had great times here.

856
00:47:28.515 --> 00:47:30.726
A change from the plonk.

857
00:47:31.435 --> 00:47:32.519
Thanks.

858
00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.188
Captain!

859
00:47:34.313 --> 00:47:35.272
What?

860
00:47:36.231 --> 00:47:37.774
It's OK. jeez.

861
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.651
As long as you eat something.

862
00:47:39.776 --> 00:47:43.113
I'll have lots of cheese
and I'll be fine.

863
00:47:44.615 --> 00:47:45.574
Tell me.

864
00:47:46.033 --> 00:47:48.202
How will you invest your money?

865
00:47:48.327 --> 00:47:50.787
Be careful. because the first year

866
00:47:51.371 --> 00:47:53.999
is tax free. but then you get fleeced.

867
00:47:54.541 --> 00:47:56.376
- You need to plan.
- I said that.

868
00:47:56.502 --> 00:47:58.879
We already know what we'll do.

869
00:47:59.004 --> 00:48:00.964
We said we'll tour the globe!

870
00:48:01.089 --> 00:48:02.341
Did we say that?

871
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.427
I can't take Asshole.
He has no license.

872
00:48:06.011 --> 00:48:07.679
Twiggy and I always said.

873
00:48:08.096 --> 00:48:11.975
if we win. we tour the globe. him and me.

874
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.520
Yeah. but we were shooting the shit.

875
00:48:16.021 --> 00:48:18.315
It was just a dream.

876
00:48:22.152 --> 00:48:23.529
It's a wonderful plan.

877
00:48:25.739 --> 00:48:28.242
Sorry. may I ask a question?

878
00:48:29.368 --> 00:48:31.286
Sure. Thérèse. Feel free.

879
00:48:32.371 --> 00:48:35.415
Well. how did you become homeless?

880
00:48:41.505 --> 00:48:43.215
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

881
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:46.343
No worries. Thérèse.

882
00:48:46.468 --> 00:48:48.762
Captain won't say.
like on crime shows.

883
00:48:50.055 --> 00:48:51.515
But I don't mind.

884
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.724
It's simple.

885
00:48:53.433 --> 00:48:57.229
When I was 13. I ran away
from my sketchy foster home.

886
00:48:58.063 --> 00:49:00.399
Of course the cops picked me up.

887
00:49:00.524 --> 00:49:03.735
put me in another home.
but I'd tasted freedom.

888
00:49:04.111 --> 00:49:07.322
The rush of running away.
sleeping on the street...

889
00:49:09.449 --> 00:49:10.534
Mega rush.

890
00:49:13.203 --> 00:49:14.538
I was hooked.

891
00:49:14.997 --> 00:49:17.583
I ran away. I ran away. I ran away.

892
00:49:18.417 --> 00:49:20.460
Even when things were good.

893
00:49:20.586 --> 00:49:23.922
Like. in Caen.
I was with this sick family.

894
00:49:24.047 --> 00:49:26.508
real nice. but I still ran away.

895
00:49:27.134 --> 00:49:28.969
To see how the cops reacted.

896
00:49:29.595 --> 00:49:32.055
Then. one time. those clowns

897
00:49:33.015 --> 00:49:34.266
didn't look for me.

898
00:49:34.391 --> 00:49:36.810
I figured. they were sick of me

899
00:49:36.935 --> 00:49:38.520
or they're too busy.

900
00:49:38.854 --> 00:49:40.022
Totally wrong.

901
00:49:40.898 --> 00:49:42.399
I'd turned 18.

902
00:49:50.574 --> 00:49:51.658
You. Twiggy?

903
00:49:59.541 --> 00:50:00.667
Separation.

904
00:50:07.799 --> 00:50:08.800
Heartbreak.

905
00:50:10.802 --> 00:50:11.887
Depression.

906
00:50:14.306 --> 00:50:15.390
Getting fired.

907
00:50:18.644 --> 00:50:19.603
No friends.

908
00:50:23.857 --> 00:50:24.983
All very fast.

909
00:50:31.114 --> 00:50:35.118
Then I met this tall weirdo
in a baseball cap.

910
00:50:35.244 --> 00:50:37.996
smoking away. who goes. “Hey. Twiggy?

911
00:50:38.121 --> 00:50:39.248
Why so sad?”

912
00:50:41.959 --> 00:50:45.254
He didn't ask who I was
or where I was from.

913
00:50:45.671 --> 00:50:48.966
He showed me the ropes.
gave me tips. a roof.

914
00:50:49.466 --> 00:50:52.344
Well. a tent. But same thing.

915
00:50:54.054 --> 00:50:55.305
He gave me shelter.

916
00:50:56.098 --> 00:50:57.474
time to recover.

917
00:50:59.434 --> 00:51:00.853
It's been seven years.

918
00:51:04.398 --> 00:51:05.649
I owe him a lot.

919
00:51:08.944 --> 00:51:13.782
Not everything.
‘cause I didn't have much. but...

920
00:51:26.795 --> 00:51:30.299
Do I tell you about my first trick
or do we have dessert?

921
00:51:31.508 --> 00:51:32.634
Dessert!

922
00:51:32.759 --> 00:51:33.969
Dessert!

923
00:51:35.804 --> 00:51:37.681
Although...

924
00:51:37.806 --> 00:51:38.765
Why not both?

925
00:51:38.891 --> 00:51:41.018
First. dessert. and then...

926
00:52:20.849 --> 00:52:23.560
Cool. What I was looking for.

927
00:52:25.896 --> 00:52:26.855
Great evening.

928
00:52:35.197 --> 00:52:37.366
- Want to come?
- I'll clean up.

929
00:52:37.491 --> 00:52:40.202
- Can I help you?
- No. I've got it.

930
00:52:46.041 --> 00:52:47.960
You have kids in France.

931
00:52:52.548 --> 00:52:54.174
How do you know?

932
00:52:57.886 --> 00:52:59.763
Even Captain doesn't know.

933
00:53:01.056 --> 00:53:03.350
Otherwise you'd want
to tour the globe.

934
00:53:03.767 --> 00:53:05.227
Or go home to Québec...

935
00:53:05.352 --> 00:53:06.353
I imagine.

936
00:53:06.687 --> 00:53:08.355
Do you see them often?

937
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.441
I mean. still. Do you still see them?

938
00:53:12.901 --> 00:53:14.736
Yes. I see them.

939
00:53:15.612 --> 00:53:16.864
as often as I can.

940
00:53:18.782 --> 00:53:22.077
Lucie plays soccer.
She just started boxing.

941
00:53:22.494 --> 00:53:23.871
She repeated grade 3.

942
00:53:23.996 --> 00:53:27.291
My little Zélie's in grade 11. No. 10.

943
00:53:27.416 --> 00:53:29.209
She's taking dance classes.

944
00:53:29.334 --> 00:53:30.335
Loves it...

945
00:53:30.669 --> 00:53:33.088
They must be thrilled for you.

946
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:34.923
Yeah.

947
00:53:40.053 --> 00:53:41.013
No.

948
00:53:42.514 --> 00:53:43.849
They don't know.

949
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:46.894
About the lottery. Or...

950
00:53:47.978 --> 00:53:48.937
the street.

951
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:52.274
You said you see them often.

952
00:53:52.399 --> 00:53:55.027
I see them. but they don't see me.

953
00:53:57.487 --> 00:53:58.488
For them.

954
00:53:58.614 --> 00:54:01.033
I disappeared seven years ago.

955
00:54:02.743 --> 00:54:04.912
But aren't you scared they...

956
00:54:06.246 --> 00:54:08.498
- may think you're...
- Dead?

957
00:54:08.749 --> 00:54:09.750
Dead.

958
00:54:09.875 --> 00:54:13.337
Better a father who's dead
than one who's homeless.

959
00:54:17.966 --> 00:54:20.511
But the situation has changed now.

960
00:54:20.802 --> 00:54:23.347
You're no longer on the street.

961
00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.349
You can see them again.

962
00:54:25.682 --> 00:54:28.894
I'd love to see them. but...

963
00:54:29.019 --> 00:54:33.065
I don't want them to see me as a bum.
Even a bum who won the lottery.

964
00:54:34.983 --> 00:54:38.237
And first I'd like to drop
at least 40 pounds.

965
00:54:38.362 --> 00:54:41.198
No other homeless person
ever gains weight.

966
00:54:42.324 --> 00:54:44.243
When I see them. I want to...

967
00:54:44.618 --> 00:54:45.744
be their MVP.

968
00:54:47.079 --> 00:54:48.038
A star.

969
00:54:48.163 --> 00:54:51.750
I want to have my own place.
a real job and...

970
00:54:51.875 --> 00:54:53.293
and a normal life.

971
00:54:56.588 --> 00:54:59.633
Enough. Shall we join the others?

972
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:13.397
To replace your Canadian passport

973
00:55:13.522 --> 00:55:15.732
requires proof you're Canadian.

974
00:55:15.858 --> 00:55:17.317
Even with this accent?

975
00:55:18.235 --> 00:55:19.194
Sorry.

976
00:55:22.114 --> 00:55:23.198
Excuse me.

977
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:26.326
Apply at the town hall
in your birthplace.

978
00:55:26.451 --> 00:55:27.828
It's unbelievable.

979
00:55:27.953 --> 00:55:32.541
I'm a Canadian in France. and neither
country can help me! What do I do?

980
00:55:32.666 --> 00:55:33.917
Sorry.

981
00:55:34.668 --> 00:55:35.711
Go ahead.

982
00:55:35.836 --> 00:55:37.921
I'm very sorry.

983
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:39.673
Yeah. what is it?

984
00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:42.926
Yeah. I left early. So?

985
00:55:43.051 --> 00:55:44.386
What are you doing?

986
00:55:44.511 --> 00:55:46.763
Deal with it. You're big boys!

987
00:55:46.889 --> 00:55:50.642
Francis. stop bothering me
or I'll confiscate your phone!

988
00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:52.269
Sorry!

989
00:55:52.394 --> 00:55:53.395
How many?

990
00:55:53.979 --> 00:55:55.105
How many what?

991
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:56.648
Kids.

992
00:55:59.193 --> 00:56:00.986
Two. why?

993
00:56:01.111 --> 00:56:03.447
Were they born in France?

994
00:56:03.864 --> 00:56:05.490
Oh! No...

995
00:56:05.616 --> 00:56:07.868
Yeah. No. that wasn't my kids.

996
00:56:07.993 --> 00:56:10.454
I have two kids.

997
00:56:10.579 --> 00:56:12.039
but that wasn't... Wait.

998
00:56:13.415 --> 00:56:15.292
Yeah. they're born here. Why?

999
00:56:15.417 --> 00:56:18.003
Make a case for family unification.

1000
00:56:18.754 --> 00:56:19.838
Are you married?

1001
00:56:22.841 --> 00:56:24.968
Their mom and I are on the outs.

1002
00:56:25.093 --> 00:56:26.595
I'll need proof.

1003
00:56:29.389 --> 00:56:31.183
Their birth certificates?

1004
00:56:31.308 --> 00:56:33.685
That would help things.

1005
00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:35.062
What's your cell?

1006
00:56:52.871 --> 00:56:54.164
Dialing...

1007
00:57:03.674 --> 00:57:04.716
Hello?

1008
00:57:07.553 --> 00:57:08.554
Hello?

1009
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:12.516
Anybody there?

1010
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.602
Hello?

1011
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:20.899
Who is it. sweetie?

1012
00:57:21.149 --> 00:57:22.442
There's nobody.

1013
00:57:55.184 --> 00:57:56.310
Guys! Guys!

1014
00:57:56.435 --> 00:57:58.896
Guys! This is Twiggy.

1015
00:57:59.021 --> 00:58:01.440
No. sorry. It's Nicolas Grenier!

1016
00:58:01.982 --> 00:58:05.152
Come try this. It's a blast!

1017
00:58:11.158 --> 00:58:12.201
Hey. whatsup?

1018
00:58:29.301 --> 00:58:30.511
Yo.

1019
00:58:35.849 --> 00:58:36.808
What's that?

1020
00:58:36.934 --> 00:58:38.727
It's for walking Asshole.

1021
00:58:38.852 --> 00:58:40.854
A big dog needs exercise.

1022
00:58:40.979 --> 00:58:43.232
Try it. you want to lose weight.

1023
00:58:43.357 --> 00:58:45.275
C'mon. this is ridiculous.

1024
00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:46.401
Captain!

1025
00:58:46.527 --> 00:58:49.863
I told him it was a bad idea.
Takes up too much space.

1026
00:58:53.033 --> 00:58:57.204
Excuse me. gents. Ladies...
You're on my bed.

1027
00:58:57.329 --> 00:58:59.289
I had a long day. I'm beat.

1028
00:58:59.414 --> 00:59:03.752
I forgot to warn you he's the biggest loser
on earth - and the moon!

1029
00:59:05.212 --> 00:59:06.380
Francis?

1030
00:59:07.172 --> 00:59:08.924
Don't try to act smart.

1031
00:59:09.925 --> 00:59:11.426
Excuse me. please.

1032
00:59:14.054 --> 00:59:15.305
Want a beer?

1033
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:17.099
No. I'm good. Thanks.

1034
00:59:19.768 --> 00:59:22.229
OK. enough's enough. dammit!

1035
00:59:22.354 --> 00:59:24.815
Everybody out. The bar's closed.

1036
00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:27.526
Don't talk to my pals that way!

1037
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:29.027
They're not your pals!

1038
00:59:29.152 --> 00:59:30.612
I'm warning you. punk.

1039
00:59:30.737 --> 00:59:33.949
Tomorrow you take this back to the store.

1040
00:59:34.074 --> 00:59:37.077
You can say it doesn't fit
my living room.

1041
00:59:37.202 --> 00:59:39.413
Maybe it'll fit up your ass.

1042
00:59:40.873 --> 00:59:42.457
What do you want?

1043
00:59:42.583 --> 00:59:44.334
You sit down!

1044
00:59:51.175 --> 00:59:52.301
Let's beat it.

1045
00:59:53.302 --> 00:59:54.469
Right!

1046
00:59:55.012 --> 00:59:55.971
Thank you!

1047
00:59:56.096 --> 00:59:57.055
See you.

1048
00:59:57.431 --> 00:59:59.975
It was fun. No worries. it's nothing.

1049
01:00:00.517 --> 01:00:02.561
- See you. sweetie.
- Cheers. Captain.

1050
01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:06.523
When you get to know them.
they're good kids.

1051
01:00:07.608 --> 01:00:10.068
Who do you think you are?

1052
01:00:10.402 --> 01:00:11.695
My old man. maybe?

1053
01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:13.739
You're not my father.

1054
01:00:14.114 --> 01:00:15.157
Thank God.

1055
01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:16.658
Asshole!

1056
01:00:16.783 --> 01:00:17.784
Watch your mouth!

1057
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:19.119
I'm calling the dog.

1058
01:00:19.244 --> 01:00:20.704
Asshole. come with me!

1059
01:00:28.253 --> 01:00:30.506
“The shipwreck of youth.”

1060
01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:36.094
About the bathroom...

1061
01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:38.138
You'll see.

1062
01:00:38.263 --> 01:00:39.223
Captain.

1063
01:00:39.348 --> 01:00:40.724
Ciao. Lettuce!

1064
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:43.810
He's funny. He has a head of lettuce.

1065
01:00:43.936 --> 01:00:46.647
You can't tell if it's iceberg or...

1066
01:00:46.772 --> 01:00:47.898
whatever.

1067
01:00:48.357 --> 01:00:49.733
Why'd you let him?

1068
01:00:49.858 --> 01:00:50.817
What?

1069
01:00:50.943 --> 01:00:53.695
I asked you to keep an eye on him.

1070
01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:56.365
He's a shopaholic.
He attracts trouble.

1071
01:00:57.991 --> 01:00:59.535
Hi. I have your sushi.

1072
01:01:00.953 --> 01:01:02.079
180 euros?

1073
01:01:02.204 --> 01:01:03.330
180 euros!

1074
01:01:03.455 --> 01:01:04.414
He never stops.

1075
01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.834
He never had Japanese food.

1076
01:01:06.959 --> 01:01:09.086
or an address. so he ordered in.

1077
01:01:09.211 --> 01:01:10.712
Stop defending him.

1078
01:01:10.838 --> 01:01:12.840
You're always on his case.

1079
01:01:12.965 --> 01:01:14.842
He's an adult.

1080
01:01:14.967 --> 01:01:18.720
Let him have fun...
As long as he keeps the receipts.

1081
01:01:18.846 --> 01:01:21.640
- It's not just that. You know!
- You're not his mom.

1082
01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:24.268
I'm not his mom. or not his dad?

1083
01:01:24.393 --> 01:01:26.103
Really. I'd like to know.

1084
01:01:26.562 --> 01:01:28.397
We don't want it. Sorry.

1085
01:01:28.522 --> 01:01:29.773
Change of plans.

1086
01:01:29.898 --> 01:01:32.609
Anyway. he already paid online.

1087
01:02:10.898 --> 01:02:12.691
Not without papers!

1088
01:02:58.987 --> 01:03:00.656
Captain? I'm home.

1089
01:03:02.199 --> 01:03:04.743
No work. No news from the embassy.

1090
01:03:04.868 --> 01:03:06.662
But bills galore!

1091
01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:14.837
Captain. did you take the 50 euros?

1092
01:03:22.678 --> 01:03:26.682
Obviously the window's open.
‘cause we pay for heating.

1093
01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:29.726
- Jeez. shit!
- I'm sorry!

1094
01:03:29.852 --> 01:03:32.104
What are you doing on the floor?

1095
01:03:32.229 --> 01:03:33.981
Still sleeping on the ground?

1096
01:03:34.106 --> 01:03:35.107
Don't touch me!

1097
01:03:36.108 --> 01:03:37.484
You haven't showered?

1098
01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:38.819
Didn't have time.

1099
01:03:38.944 --> 01:03:39.987
No time? I bet.

1100
01:03:40.112 --> 01:03:42.698
- What did you do today?
- Bought smokes.

1101
01:03:42.823 --> 01:03:43.699
Of course.

1102
01:03:43.824 --> 01:03:45.492
Could you pass me one?

1103
01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:52.541
- Sure you're OK?
- Yeah!

1104
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.251
Great.

1105
01:03:54.626 --> 01:03:59.047
Y'know. if we want a normal life.
we have to live normally.

1106
01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.550
Sure thing. you're right.

1107
01:04:02.092 --> 01:04:03.051
Good!

1108
01:04:03.177 --> 01:04:05.304
- That hurts!
- Yeah. but...

1109
01:04:05.429 --> 01:04:07.890
I can't see you under all the crap.

1110
01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.611
Hi. this is Francis. aka Arrow.

1111
01:04:20.736 --> 01:04:23.488
Leave me a message after the beeeee...

1112
01:04:27.618 --> 01:04:29.036
It's me again.

1113
01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:33.790
I don't know where you are.

1114
01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.126
Give us a ring. OK?

1115
01:04:37.753 --> 01:04:39.963
I think Captain's starting to miss you.

1116
01:04:40.464 --> 01:04:42.549
Hold on. I think you're calling.

1117
01:04:43.008 --> 01:04:44.927
Where the hell are you?

1118
01:04:46.178 --> 01:04:47.221
Nadia?

1119
01:04:48.305 --> 01:04:50.849
Sorry. I thought it was Francis.

1120
01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:55.646
I knew he'd wind up shafting us.
I knew it!

1121
01:04:56.647 --> 01:04:57.814
It's impossible.

1122
01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:59.900
He'll come back. I'm sure.

1123
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:03.737
How's Captain doing?

1124
01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:06.198
Well. he drinks. smokes. stinks...

1125
01:05:06.323 --> 01:05:07.407
The usual.

1126
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:13.664
I hadn't realized I'd have to babysit
as well as pay rent.

1127
01:05:20.254 --> 01:05:21.338
It's fine.

1128
01:05:21.463 --> 01:05:22.631
I'll pay.

1129
01:05:23.215 --> 01:05:25.092
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

1130
01:05:25.217 --> 01:05:26.552
Thank you.

1131
01:05:26.677 --> 01:05:28.053
Waiter wanted

1132
01:05:28.178 --> 01:05:29.513
Sorry?

1133
01:05:29.638 --> 01:05:30.973
You interested?

1134
01:05:33.892 --> 01:05:35.686
Well. yes. but...

1135
01:05:36.687 --> 01:05:38.981
I don't have all my papers.

1136
01:05:41.358 --> 01:05:44.903
You Québecers break me up everytime.

1137
01:05:45.946 --> 01:05:48.866
Come by tomorrow.
We'll see how things go.

1138
01:05:48.991 --> 01:05:50.284
Alright?

1139
01:05:53.161 --> 01:05:55.914
I've found a job!

1140
01:05:56.039 --> 01:05:57.708
All by myself!

1141
01:05:59.585 --> 01:06:00.711
Bravo.

1142
01:06:04.089 --> 01:06:05.132
Must be the kid.

1143
01:06:05.257 --> 01:06:08.385
No. it's a buyer for the treadmill.

1144
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:10.053
I sold it online.

1145
01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:12.472
Along with all the other crap.

1146
01:06:13.223 --> 01:06:15.517
- I don't like this. it's wrong.
- No!

1147
01:06:15.642 --> 01:06:16.977
He's in the wrong.

1148
01:06:17.436 --> 01:06:19.062
Anyway. we've no choice.

1149
01:06:19.188 --> 01:06:22.065
We have to manage. and we will.

1150
01:06:22.191 --> 01:06:26.069
On our own. like adults.
It's the end of the tunnel. Captain!

1151
01:06:26.195 --> 01:06:27.821
I can see the light!

1152
01:06:30.199 --> 01:06:31.200
Yes. hello?

1153
01:06:31.325 --> 01:06:33.160
6th floor. on the left.

1154
01:06:35.537 --> 01:06:37.581
Last one on your tab.

1155
01:06:37.873 --> 01:06:40.667
I mean. until Arrow shows up.

1156
01:06:40.959 --> 01:06:43.462
He hasn't paid his bill and...

1157
01:06:44.296 --> 01:06:45.589
I'm sorry.

1158
01:06:47.174 --> 01:06:48.967
No worries. I understand.

1159
01:06:51.136 --> 01:06:52.387
Sorry!

1160
01:07:04.983 --> 01:07:06.276
Excuse me.

1161
01:07:07.152 --> 01:07:12.157
Would you have a meal ticket.
some change. a cig...

1162
01:07:12.282 --> 01:07:14.701
friendship. a smile. blue eyes.

1163
01:07:14.826 --> 01:07:16.286
pretty teeth...

1164
01:07:16.411 --> 01:07:18.747
Hello. this isn't a survey...

1165
01:07:18.872 --> 01:07:21.250
but to cadge small change. that's all.

1166
01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:24.336
So. a Coke and tartar sauce. Enjoy!

1167
01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.214
Here's your Samurai. miss.

1168
01:07:29.049 --> 01:07:31.593
With curry sauce. 9.50. please.

1169
01:07:32.302 --> 01:07:34.596
A curry and mayo combo. please.

1170
01:07:34.721 --> 01:07:35.889
Yes. Memet!

1171
01:07:36.014 --> 01:07:39.309
- With pleasure. here!
- Who ordered the harissa?

1172
01:07:39.601 --> 01:07:40.978
Careful. it's hot!

1173
01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:43.814
Please. not at work. Nico!

1174
01:07:43.939 --> 01:07:46.066
It might be the embassy. I have to.

1175
01:07:46.191 --> 01:07:47.943
- He's new.
- Two minutes! Hello?

1176
01:07:48.068 --> 01:07:51.488
That's my family name. I'm Nicolas Grenier.

1177
01:07:55.033 --> 01:07:56.118
Sorry!

1178
01:07:56.243 --> 01:07:57.828
C'mon. Nico. Let's go.

1179
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:59.830
The drinks are there.

1180
01:07:59.955 --> 01:08:01.957
OK. I'll try to manage.

1181
01:08:02.624 --> 01:08:04.877
Nico. you can't leave now.

1182
01:08:05.002 --> 01:08:07.296
If you leave. don't come back.

1183
01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:08.505
Two minutes.

1184
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:10.632
- Look at the lineup.
- 90 seconds!

1185
01:08:10.757 --> 01:08:12.467
What did you want?

1186
01:08:12.593 --> 01:08:13.886
One BBQ!

1187
01:08:14.511 --> 01:08:17.848
Pick up! Pick up!

1188
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:21.393
What. do I talk now?

1189
01:08:21.518 --> 01:08:24.604
So. hello. I dunno...

1190
01:08:33.154 --> 01:08:34.406
Curry sauce. OK!

1191
01:08:34.907 --> 01:08:36.533
What? What's wrong?

1192
01:08:39.745 --> 01:08:41.330
He went into shock.

1193
01:08:41.455 --> 01:08:45.751
He was at Disneyland.
so we thought he might be epileptic.

1194
01:08:45.876 --> 01:08:48.504
The scan excluded it being a stroke

1195
01:08:48.629 --> 01:08:50.339
from a high-thrill ride.

1196
01:08:50.464 --> 01:08:54.134
He'd been staying with friends
at a hotel there.

1197
01:08:54.259 --> 01:08:57.179
Wait. a hotel at Disneyland?

1198
01:08:59.473 --> 01:09:00.599
Stupid ass!

1199
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.100
Sorry.

1200
01:09:03.227 --> 01:09:04.645
So what is it. then?

1201
01:09:04.770 --> 01:09:06.438
Your friend OD'd.

1202
01:09:06.813 --> 01:09:08.814
No. that's impossible.

1203
01:09:08.941 --> 01:09:11.484
He's not a user.
That's his normal state.

1204
01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:13.694
He's Obélix. he fell in a potion.

1205
01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:16.782
We pumped his stomach
and filtered his blood.

1206
01:09:16.907 --> 01:09:20.661
His MRI shows abnormally low
cerebral activity.

1207
01:09:20.786 --> 01:09:22.828
That's normal for him. too.

1208
01:09:23.247 --> 01:09:28.167
It also surprised me at first.
There's not much going on up there.

1209
01:09:28.292 --> 01:09:30.921
I don't think you understand.

1210
01:09:31.587 --> 01:09:32.923
This is serious.

1211
01:09:34.258 --> 01:09:36.969
We don't yet have a final prognosis.

1212
01:09:37.094 --> 01:09:41.223
But we can't rule out
physical or neurological damage.

1213
01:09:41.723 --> 01:09:43.015
Am I being clear?

1214
01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.142
Yeah.

1215
01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:53.234
Does he have family we can contact?

1216
01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:56.613
He has two numbers in his cell.
and one doesn't answer.

1217
01:09:57.114 --> 01:09:58.407
No. there's nobody.

1218
01:09:58.532 --> 01:10:00.200
Nobody aside from us.

1219
01:10:02.703 --> 01:10:03.662
I'll leave you.

1220
01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:09.543
About the dog...

1221
01:10:09.668 --> 01:10:11.378
You better take him.

1222
01:10:11.503 --> 01:10:12.462
The dog?

1223
01:10:12.588 --> 01:10:15.716
Do it soon. because after three days they're...

1224
01:10:17.759 --> 01:10:20.053
Heel. boy! Heel!

1225
01:10:21.013 --> 01:10:22.097
Stop!

1226
01:10:22.222 --> 01:10:23.307
Asshole!

1227
01:10:32.065 --> 01:10:33.233
Asshole. here boy!

1228
01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:35.652
That's my doggie. Here. boy.

1229
01:10:35.777 --> 01:10:39.323
C'mere. baby. Good Asshole!

1230
01:10:40.115 --> 01:10:41.742
Where's Arrow?

1231
01:10:43.535 --> 01:10:44.661
Where were you?

1232
01:10:44.786 --> 01:10:45.829
I get it.

1233
01:10:45.954 --> 01:10:48.207
It wasn't a great first day.

1234
01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:50.792
Yes. give Daddy a kiss.

1235
01:10:50.918 --> 01:10:53.086
Great. Thanks!

1236
01:10:53.212 --> 01:10:55.756
Relax. it doesn't matter.

1237
01:10:56.215 --> 01:10:57.633
Sit down. have a beer.

1238
01:10:57.758 --> 01:10:59.760
- You're right.
- Be cool!

1239
01:10:59.885 --> 01:11:01.094
It doesn't matter.

1240
01:11:02.095 --> 01:11:03.931
Nothing matters for you.

1241
01:11:13.649 --> 01:11:14.733
Not answering?

1242
01:11:18.612 --> 01:11:20.155
It could be important.

1243
01:11:23.492 --> 01:11:25.911
No. too late. Voicemail.

1244
01:11:26.036 --> 01:11:29.206
- Do I talk? It's Captain...
- I'll leave a message.

1245
01:11:29.831 --> 01:11:31.124
Hi. Cap. It's me.

1246
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:35.879
Just calling to say I've left you
56 messages and 122 SMSs.

1247
01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:37.965
that you probably haven't seen.

1248
01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:43.345
You must be doing more important things.
like drinking and smoking.

1249
01:11:44.137 --> 01:11:47.975
But no matter. because with you.
nothing ever matters.

1250
01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.643
OK. I get it. Twiggy.

1251
01:11:49.768 --> 01:11:51.603
No. ‘cause thanks to you

1252
01:11:51.728 --> 01:11:53.981
I lost the only job I found.

1253
01:11:56.608 --> 01:11:58.443
And Arrow's in hospital.

1254
01:11:58.735 --> 01:12:00.904
He fried the two neurons he had.

1255
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:03.407
OD. a synthetic drug.

1256
01:12:03.532 --> 01:12:05.242
The kid's a vegetable.

1257
01:12:08.829 --> 01:12:13.083
That's about it.
Call me when you get this message.

1258
01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:16.044
Or don't. As you wish. Lots of love.

1259
01:12:21.925 --> 01:12:23.385
You piss me off.

1260
01:12:27.097 --> 01:12:28.724
You really piss me off!

1261
01:12:41.695 --> 01:12:43.614
Know where he's stayed?

1262
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:46.200
Disneyland!

1263
01:12:47.618 --> 01:12:49.620
As if he was Michael Jackson.

1264
01:12:58.837 --> 01:13:00.547
How'd you buy beer?

1265
01:13:08.055 --> 01:13:09.056
Captain?

1266
01:13:11.058 --> 01:13:12.684
I did what I had to.

1267
01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:15.312
I made a stew for us.

1268
01:13:16.063 --> 01:13:17.481
You're proud of it.

1269
01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.316
Not particularly.

1270
01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:23.070
but for days you've bitched
we're out of food.

1271
01:13:23.195 --> 01:13:26.156
So don't blame me for doing something.

1272
01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:30.118
When will it sink in
that you have to stop?

1273
01:13:31.411 --> 01:13:33.580
Respect yourself. Dammit!

1274
01:13:34.581 --> 01:13:37.292
Know what I see when I look at you?

1275
01:13:38.043 --> 01:13:39.127
A bum!

1276
01:13:40.379 --> 01:13:44.007
Know what your problem is?
You've no desire to change.

1277
01:13:44.132 --> 01:13:48.262
You're ragging on me about hustling
when the kid's in hospital?

1278
01:13:48.804 --> 01:13:52.808
What's wrong with you?
All you care about is money.

1279
01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:55.060
You don't care about Arrow and me.

1280
01:13:55.352 --> 01:13:59.064
You just want to go back
to your boring little life.

1281
01:13:59.189 --> 01:14:03.068
You bet I want to get my money
and get out of here.

1282
01:14:03.193 --> 01:14:04.653
What did you think?

1283
01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.155
We'd spend our lives together?

1284
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:20.502
You were never serious about our trip.

1285
01:14:20.836 --> 01:14:22.212
Captain. you're drunk.

1286
01:14:22.337 --> 01:14:24.673
I'm beat. I don't feel like talking.

1287
01:14:25.632 --> 01:14:28.760
You lied to me since day 1.
Played me for a fool.

1288
01:14:28.886 --> 01:14:31.972
I didn't lie to you.
We were fantasizing.

1289
01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:33.932
- I gave up everything.
- What?

1290
01:14:34.057 --> 01:14:36.018
You had nothing.
You still don't!

1291
01:14:36.143 --> 01:14:37.144
You are nothing!

1292
01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.402
Lemme tell you something.

1293
01:14:45.986 --> 01:14:47.487
I like you. Twiggy.

1294
01:14:47.613 --> 01:14:49.489
I even like you a lot.

1295
01:14:49.615 --> 01:14:52.075
But the guy you're becoming.

1296
01:14:52.201 --> 01:14:54.786
this Nicolas Grenier...

1297
01:14:54.912 --> 01:14:56.914
He's a real dick.

1298
01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:01.418
What now?

1299
01:15:01.543 --> 01:15:03.128
You gonna slug me. too?

1300
01:15:10.928 --> 01:15:12.304
What are you doing?

1301
01:15:12.429 --> 01:15:13.639
Being proactive.

1302
01:15:20.521 --> 01:15:23.398
In seven years.
we never fought like this.

1303
01:15:24.107 --> 01:15:25.817
We've become ugly.

1304
01:15:27.069 --> 01:15:28.195
You especially.

1305
01:17:06.752 --> 01:17:08.504
Should've taken your keys.

1306
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:11.131
Hello. I'm here for the raclette set.

1307
01:17:12.257 --> 01:17:13.383
Sorry?

1308
01:17:13.717 --> 01:17:15.260
The raclette set.

1309
01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:18.055
Right. Yes.

1310
01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:20.182
Sorry. I forgot you were coming.

1311
01:17:20.307 --> 01:17:21.725
- I'll get it.
- Great.

1312
01:17:33.111 --> 01:17:34.905
Sorry. I can't find it.

1313
01:17:35.906 --> 01:17:37.824
My roommate must've sold it.

1314
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:39.117
Come on!

1315
01:17:39.243 --> 01:17:42.663
I have a toaster
with built-in Bluetooth speaker.

1316
01:17:42.788 --> 01:17:44.206
Jeez. no.

1317
01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:49.711
- Have a good day.
- Sure.

1318
01:18:09.815 --> 01:18:11.650
They gave you a nice room.

1319
01:18:15.404 --> 01:18:18.407
They said you showed big improvement.

1320
01:18:18.532 --> 01:18:21.285
To tell the truth. I'm not impressed.

1321
01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.039
Anybody home?

1322
01:18:34.423 --> 01:18:36.508
Step on me again. I'll sue!

1323
01:18:36.633 --> 01:18:37.885
What the hell?

1324
01:18:39.344 --> 01:18:41.346
- Here...
- No. don't touch me!

1325
01:18:58.697 --> 01:18:59.698
How is he?

1326
01:18:59.948 --> 01:19:01.325
He hasn't woken up.

1327
01:19:05.162 --> 01:19:06.121
I'm sorry.

1328
01:19:08.207 --> 01:19:09.374
I was a jerk.

1329
01:19:10.042 --> 01:19:11.126
A big jerk!

1330
01:19:13.128 --> 01:19:14.963
And I wasn't honest with you.

1331
01:19:17.508 --> 01:19:19.176
I have two kids.

1332
01:19:21.303 --> 01:19:22.596
I have a family

1333
01:19:22.721 --> 01:19:24.431
that I abandoned.

1334
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:30.270
That's why I don't want to travel.

1335
01:19:30.395 --> 01:19:33.565
I saw the lottery as my chance

1336
01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:35.359
to reconnect with them.

1337
01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:37.611
Why not tell me?

1338
01:19:37.736 --> 01:19:42.199
You always say that being on the street
is like in a crime show.

1339
01:19:42.324 --> 01:19:44.493
They're kids. not bags of milk!

1340
01:19:57.589 --> 01:19:58.757
I was a dick too.

1341
01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:02.010
Less than you!

1342
01:20:04.137 --> 01:20:05.514
But I was a dick.

1343
01:20:05.806 --> 01:20:07.224
We're two dicks.

1344
01:20:08.016 --> 01:20:09.017
Three.

1345
01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:11.687
You're awake?

1346
01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:14.356
No. I'm dreaming. asshole.

1347
01:20:18.443 --> 01:20:19.528
Asshole!

1348
01:20:19.653 --> 01:20:20.696
Where's Asshole?

1349
01:20:20.821 --> 01:20:23.782
He's fine. I tied him up
in the parking lot.

1350
01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:26.785
They wouldn't let me bring him inside.

1351
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:28.495
I wanted you to see him.

1352
01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:29.746
Against the rules.

1353
01:20:29.872 --> 01:20:31.373
OK. let's go.

1354
01:20:31.498 --> 01:20:32.666
- Where?
- Where?

1355
01:20:33.292 --> 01:20:34.418
Hold on!

1356
01:20:35.502 --> 01:20:36.837
You need to rest.

1357
01:20:41.091 --> 01:20:42.176
You OK?

1358
01:20:44.595 --> 01:20:46.555
- Coming. baby!
- Big improvement?

1359
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.056
Don't help me. shit.

1360
01:20:48.182 --> 01:20:50.434
Right! Wait. don't move!

1361
01:20:50.559 --> 01:20:53.312
- Asshole!
- Pipe down.

1362
01:20:55.063 --> 01:20:56.148
Asshole!

1363
01:20:58.192 --> 01:20:59.318
Wait.

1364
01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:01.195
Asshole. Daddy's coming!

1365
01:21:02.279 --> 01:21:04.323
We'll get someone.

1366
01:21:07.451 --> 01:21:09.286
You're assholes!

1367
01:21:10.662 --> 01:21:12.164
Pipe down!

1368
01:21:12.289 --> 01:21:13.373
Daddy's coming!

1369
01:21:13.498 --> 01:21:14.708
Asshole!

1370
01:21:15.459 --> 01:21:16.877
What do we do?

1371
01:21:17.002 --> 01:21:18.253
Open the window!

1372
01:21:19.296 --> 01:21:21.757
We're not taking him out the window?

1373
01:21:27.054 --> 01:21:28.305
Asshole!

1374
01:21:28.597 --> 01:21:29.765
Are you hurt?

1375
01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:31.975
I don't feel a thing. Push!

1376
01:21:35.437 --> 01:21:36.522
I'm coming!

1377
01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:40.776
We're coming!
Stop shouting!

1378
01:21:45.113 --> 01:21:46.114
I'm here!

1379
01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:48.075
Where's Captain? Where's Captain?

1380
01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.201
Shit. I dunno!

1381
01:21:49.326 --> 01:21:50.369
Captain?

1382
01:21:50.494 --> 01:21:52.496
Where's Asshole? I miss him!

1383
01:21:52.621 --> 01:21:54.289
It's alright! It's alright!

1384
01:21:54.414 --> 01:21:55.749
I wanna see Asshole!

1385
01:21:55.874 --> 01:21:57.459
Asshole!

1386
01:21:57.584 --> 01:21:59.378
He's here!

1387
01:21:59.503 --> 01:22:01.338
Asshole! Daddy's here!

1388
01:22:02.381 --> 01:22:03.966
Yes. Asshole.

1389
01:22:08.011 --> 01:22:09.263
Pee pee! Pee pee!

1390
01:22:10.639 --> 01:22:12.015
You need to pee?

1391
01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:13.809
Now. guys. Now!

1392
01:22:13.934 --> 01:22:15.853
- We were inside!
- There's a toilet!

1393
01:22:15.978 --> 01:22:17.312
Pee pee now!

1394
01:22:22.609 --> 01:22:23.610
Go on!

1395
01:22:23.735 --> 01:22:24.695
I can't!

1396
01:22:25.279 --> 01:22:26.989
C'mon. you can do it!

1397
01:22:27.114 --> 01:22:29.283
I can't. It's not coming.

1398
01:22:34.746 --> 01:22:35.747
You gotta help.

1399
01:22:35.873 --> 01:22:37.749
- You. I'm holding him.
- I can't.

1400
01:22:37.875 --> 01:22:39.710
C'mon. it's not your first.

1401
01:22:41.253 --> 01:22:42.588
Christ. go for it!

1402
01:22:42.713 --> 01:22:43.714
Just a sec!

1403
01:22:44.089 --> 01:22:46.675
Jeez. feeling chilly. Francis?

1404
01:22:47.676 --> 01:22:49.511
- Up yours!
- I can't find it!

1405
01:22:49.636 --> 01:22:51.221
Oh. here it is.

1406
01:22:51.555 --> 01:22:52.890
His mini-me.

1407
01:23:02.482 --> 01:23:03.775
Feels good. huh?

1408
01:23:07.821 --> 01:23:09.948
Stop! Stop!

1409
01:23:10.073 --> 01:23:11.825
Ease off. it's not a flute.

1410
01:23:17.247 --> 01:23:18.582
It's raining.

1411
01:23:19.791 --> 01:23:20.792
It's raining!

1412
01:23:20.918 --> 01:23:22.336
C'mon. finish up!

1413
01:23:22.461 --> 01:23:24.213
- Hurry up!
- The relief!

1414
01:23:24.338 --> 01:23:25.422
A bit more.

1415
01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:28.926
I've had it! I've had it!

1416
01:23:29.051 --> 01:23:30.636
C'mon. finish up.

1417
01:23:30.761 --> 01:23:32.012
That's it. I think.

1418
01:23:32.596 --> 01:23:33.847
The last drop.

1419
01:23:34.973 --> 01:23:36.517
All done.

1420
01:23:38.268 --> 01:23:39.478
Finished?

1421
01:23:44.525 --> 01:23:45.526
Shall we?

1422
01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:48.612
Why not?

1423
01:23:50.197 --> 01:23:51.615
Guys. what's going on?

1424
01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:52.699
What is this?

1425
01:23:52.824 --> 01:23:53.867
We're dancing!

1426
01:23:55.118 --> 01:23:56.954
- Let yourself go...
- Relax...

1427
01:23:57.079 --> 01:23:58.997
Just surrender

1428
01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:04.211
- Because you know
- It's good for you

1429
01:24:05.254 --> 01:24:09.675
I love to dance in the rain!

1430
01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.927
I'm doing my thing to the max!

1431
01:24:48.255 --> 01:24:49.339
You alright?

1432
01:24:49.923 --> 01:24:51.216
Visiting time's up.

1433
01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.719
He needs to rest.

1434
01:24:54.428 --> 01:24:55.429
Really!

1435
01:25:01.351 --> 01:25:02.936
See you. son.

1436
01:25:15.657 --> 01:25:17.534
Sorry I slapped you.

1437
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:19.036
You were right.

1438
01:25:23.957 --> 01:25:26.168
I am not your father. Francis.

1439
01:25:29.463 --> 01:25:31.256
Too bad. I'd like that.

1440
01:25:32.716 --> 01:25:35.636
A dad like you is better than a dead dad.

1441
01:25:40.307 --> 01:25:41.266
Yeah.

1442
01:25:43.769 --> 01:25:45.145
See you. pal.

1443
01:25:50.067 --> 01:25:51.318
Thanks.

1444
01:25:55.656 --> 01:25:57.908
Leave the nurses alone!

1445
01:26:03.664 --> 01:26:04.873
What are you up to?

1446
01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:06.917
I'll go have a drink.

1447
01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:08.585
It's thirsty out.

1448
01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.135
I'm gonna tell my kids I'm alive.

1449
01:26:18.804 --> 01:26:20.055
Yeah. good idea.

1450
01:26:30.649 --> 01:26:31.733
What'll I say?

1451
01:26:33.443 --> 01:26:36.321
“Hi there. it's Daddy.
I won the lottery!”

1452
01:26:38.282 --> 01:26:40.826
Trust yourself.
you'll find the words.

1453
01:26:41.535 --> 01:26:44.037
I know you. you'll be perfect.

1454
01:26:55.549 --> 01:26:57.134
You go. Buzz Lightyear.

1455
01:27:20.782 --> 01:27:21.867
Dialing...

1456
01:27:24.328 --> 01:27:25.287
Yes?

1457
01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:30.584
Anybody there?

1458
01:27:32.044 --> 01:27:33.128
It's me.

1459
01:27:55.567 --> 01:27:56.735
I won the lottery.

1460
01:28:22.845 --> 01:28:24.096
Here are the papers.

1461
01:28:29.852 --> 01:28:30.978
Thanks.

1462
01:28:31.478 --> 01:28:33.188
Don't come back.

1463
01:28:34.773 --> 01:28:35.941
I met someone.

1464
01:28:36.358 --> 01:28:38.402
He loves them. we're a family.

1465
01:28:41.405 --> 01:28:43.073
They're my girls. too.

1466
01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.910
They should know their dad.

1467
01:28:47.035 --> 01:28:48.453
They know.

1468
01:28:49.246 --> 01:28:50.706
They know who he is.

1469
01:28:51.123 --> 01:28:53.208
They know they grew up penniless.

1470
01:28:54.585 --> 01:28:57.713
That I worked two jobs
to pay off his debts.

1471
01:28:59.339 --> 01:29:01.800
That we couldn't afford vacations.

1472
01:29:04.136 --> 01:29:07.931
And that thanks to him. Mom had a depression.

1473
01:29:09.099 --> 01:29:10.642
Don't worry. they know.

1474
01:29:16.982 --> 01:29:18.859
- You can't do that to me.
- No!

1475
01:29:18.984 --> 01:29:20.944
- No. you...
- Mommy?

1476
01:29:21.069 --> 01:29:22.529
You did that to us.

1477
01:29:22.654 --> 01:29:24.198
He's so cute!

1478
01:29:24.323 --> 01:29:25.824
Go inside. it's cold.

1479
01:29:25.949 --> 01:29:26.992
Can I pet him?

1480
01:29:27.117 --> 01:29:29.244
Of course. look.

1481
01:29:29.369 --> 01:29:30.454
I love dogs.

1482
01:29:30.579 --> 01:29:31.830
He's super friendly.

1483
01:29:36.084 --> 01:29:37.586
He's so cute!

1484
01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:39.338
He's a pain. but nice.

1485
01:29:39.463 --> 01:29:41.089
He's too cute!

1486
01:29:42.007 --> 01:29:44.134
- What's his name?
- Asshole.

1487
01:29:44.259 --> 01:29:45.302
Asshole.

1488
01:29:45.427 --> 01:29:47.554
Hi. Asshole.

1489
01:29:47.679 --> 01:29:50.641
He's not mine. he belongs to a friend.

1490
01:29:50.766 --> 01:29:52.601
Hello. little Asshole!

1491
01:29:52.726 --> 01:29:55.103
You see. he's friendly. huh?

1492
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:56.146
Right?

1493
01:29:56.855 --> 01:29:58.065
You're Zélie?

1494
01:29:58.190 --> 01:30:00.067
- Yes.
- Go inside. dear.

1495
01:30:00.192 --> 01:30:01.902
- No. please!
- Zélie?

1496
01:30:02.402 --> 01:30:03.695
- For you!
- Really?

1497
01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:04.780
Yup.

1498
01:30:04.905 --> 01:30:06.823
Thank you. I love it!

1499
01:30:06.949 --> 01:30:08.367
Get inside!

1500
01:30:09.368 --> 01:30:10.327
Bye!

1501
01:30:10.452 --> 01:30:11.495
Goodbye.

1502
01:30:13.247 --> 01:30:14.540
Is Lucie home?

1503
01:30:16.083 --> 01:30:17.334
Bring that back.

1504
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:24.174
Yeah.

1505
01:30:43.193 --> 01:30:44.903
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1506
01:30:45.904 --> 01:30:47.114
Have a good evening.

1507
01:30:50.534 --> 01:30:52.411
Are you from Québec?

1508
01:31:19.521 --> 01:31:20.606
Dad?

1509
01:32:16.119 --> 01:32:19.331
Grenier - Captain - Courtass

1510
01:32:24.878 --> 01:32:26.421
- Hello.
- Hello.

1511
01:32:29.842 --> 01:32:33.345
Dear Twiggy. my old branch...

1512
01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:37.266
Day 174.

1513
01:32:37.391 --> 01:32:39.309
Here we are in India.

1514
01:32:39.768 --> 01:32:44.565
The Taj Mahal is a wonder.
You have to come and see it.

1515
01:32:46.108 --> 01:32:47.317
I'm fine.

1516
01:32:47.442 --> 01:32:49.236
Well. more or less.

1517
01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:53.574
Like they say.
travel broadens old minds.

1518
01:32:54.032 --> 01:32:56.410
I wish I was sharing this with you.

1519
01:32:56.535 --> 01:32:59.746
but discovering the world
with the kid is a joy.

1520
01:32:59.872 --> 01:33:01.915
Even though it can be too much.

1521
01:33:04.626 --> 01:33:06.795
Only two hotels
kicked us out so far

1522
01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:10.966
and we're still not in jail.
so I guess we're doing fine.

1523
01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.512
I'm living my dream. dude.

1524
01:33:15.637 --> 01:33:17.723
And I'm glad you are too.

1525
01:33:18.724 --> 01:33:20.475
Sending you a big hug.

1526
01:33:21.643 --> 01:33:23.395
Your old friend Captain.

1527
01:33:25.063 --> 01:33:26.773
Stop eating your boogers.

1528
01:33:28.567 --> 01:33:30.110
- Hi.
- Hi. girls.

1529
01:33:30.235 --> 01:33:31.278
Asshole!

1530
01:33:42.831 --> 01:33:44.208
Asshole. get inside!
