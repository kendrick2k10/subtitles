HARLEM AND PERHAPS THE MOST
HISTORIC INDEPENDENT VENUE IN

AMERICA.

1479
01:45:32.859 --> 01:45:36.229
LET'S MEET BILLY MITCHELL AT ONE
OF THE MOST ICONIC PLACES FOR

1480
01:45:36.296 --> 01:45:38.732
MUSICIANS TO PERFORM. AND FOR

1481
01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:42.369
THE WORLD FAMOUS APOLLO THEATER.

1482
01:45:43.603 --> 01:45:49.443
MY NAME IS BILLY MITCHELL.
THEY CALL ME MR. APPALLO. I

1483
01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:53.447
FIRST STARTED RUNNING ERRANDS AT
THE THEATER. I USED TO RUN

1484
01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:55.515
ERRANDS FOR JAMES BROWN AND HIS
BAND.

1485
01:45:55.582 --> 01:45:57.617
HE WOULD ALWAYS ASK ME.
MR. BILLY. HOW ARE YOU DOING IN

1486
01:45:57.684 --> 01:46:00.654
SCHOOL. I WOULD SAY I'M DOING
GREAT. AND APPARENTLY HE DIDN'T

1487
01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:05.358
BELIEVE ME. BECAUSE ONE DAY
MR. BROWN MADE ME LEAVE THE

1488
01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:07.928
APPALLO. GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO
THE BRONX. GET MY REPORT CARD

1489
01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:09.463
AND SHOW IT TO HIM.

1490
01:46:09.529 --> 01:46:12.933
AND WHEN JAMES BROWN NOTICED MY
REPORT CARD HE TOLD ME THAT I

1491
01:46:12.999 --> 01:46:15.936
WAS NOT ALLOWED TO COME BACK TO
THE APPALLO AND RUNNER RANDS

1492
01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:17.237
UNTIL I GOT MY GRADES UP.

1493
01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:20.240
SO WITH THAT THREAT IN MIND. I
BECAME A MEMBER OF THE HONOR

1494
01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:24.244
ROLL AND AS A GRADUATION GIFT
JAMES BROWN GAVE ME SOME MONEY.

1495
01:46:24.311 --> 01:46:27.447
I USED THAT MONEY TO ENROLL INTO
BUSINESS SCHOOL AND THAT STARTED

1496
01:46:27.514 --> 01:46:31.485
MY CAREER AT THE APPALLO
THEATER.

1497
01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:32.719
THANK YOU JAMES BROWN.

1498
01:46:32.786 --> 01:46:37.624

THAT NOT ONLY SHOWED BLACK

1499

FIRST THAT HIRED BLACK CREW AND

1500

ALSO LET BLACKS SIT IN THE
AUDIENCE.

1501
01:46:42.529 --> 01:46:45.699

THEATER IN HARLEM TO DO THAT.

1502
01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:48.902
CULTURALLY THIS PLACE IS LIKE
THE BEACON FOR

1503

BIG CITY. A KID. LISTEN HOPE.

LIVES TO THIS WORK.

2050
02:21:31.816 --> 02:21:35.286
THE RECORDING ACADEMY'S JOB
ISN'T JUST TO HAND OUT AWARDS.

2051
02:21:35.353 --> 02:21:39.390

2060
02:21:59.677 --> 02:22:02.146
BOARD IS THAT THE RECORDING
ACADEMY IS SO MUCH MORE THAN

2061
02:22:02.213 --> 02:22:05.516

2087

THIS IS BILLIE EILISH.

2088
02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:38.943
THERE WAS LIKE A PERIOD OF
TIME WHERE I LIKE DIDN'T WANT TO

2089
02:23:39.010 --> 02:23:44.949
GO TO SLEEP BECAUSE I WAS
FREAKED OUT BY MY DREAMS.

2090
02:23:45.016 --> 02:23:49.487

LUCID DREAMS.
