00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.763
is not in your job description.

181
00:11:25.592 --> 00:11:28.212
(elevator dings)

182
00:11:28.212 --> 00:11:31.671
Listen. if you can sign
up six new clients.

183
00:11:31.671 --> 00:11:35.450
and you can stay with Vin for
three days. I promise you.

184
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:40.450
I will look at every single
proposal that you give me. okay?

185
00:11:41.972 --> 00:11:43.633
Thank you.

186
00:11:43.633 --> 00:11:46.251
- [Man On TV] And the
ghouls disturb you. darling?

187
00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:50.181
- Darling. the only ghoul
in the house is you.

188
00:11:50.181 --> 00:11:51.831
- Then don't sit up all night.

189
00:11:51.831 --> 00:11:54.192
thinking of ways to get rid of me.

190
00:11:54.192 --> 00:11:57.525
- [Reporter] Fire until the danger is...

191
00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:03.521
- Come on. let's go. We
need to get on the road.

192
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.929
- Are we having a monthly visit?

193
00:12:07.929 --> 00:12:10.429
(phone rings)

194
00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:12.565
- Jerk.

195
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.210
Tyrese. this is Vin. Vin. Tyrese.

196
00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:28.561
(somber music)

197
00:12:29.489 --> 00:12:31.906
Put your things in the trunk.

198
00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:49.265
(playful orchestral music)

199
00:12:57.674 --> 00:12:58.715
- Shotgun.

200
00:12:58.715 --> 00:13:00.632
- No. you. in the back.

201
00:13:13.513 --> 00:13:17.971
- So. what cities are we
going to. Your Highness?

202
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:22.142
- We're going to Knoxville
today. Louisville tomorrow.

203
00:13:22.142 --> 00:13:24.220
and then Nashville.

204
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.220
- Nashville?

205
00:13:26.481 --> 00:13:27.981
- Yeah. Nashville.

206
00:13:37.884 --> 00:13:40.726
(truck horn blares)

207
00:13:40.726 --> 00:13:42.059
- My bad. y'all.

208
00:13:44.396 --> 00:13:48.229
- Hey. Boss. Can we turn
the radio on. please?

209
00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:53.316
(Ragan sighs)

210
00:13:53.316 --> 00:13:58.316
(radio chatter)
(static hisses and crackles)

211
00:13:58.766 --> 00:14:00.276
- [Woman On Radio] When
I was a little girl.

212
00:14:00.276 --> 00:14:02.311
I dreamed of being a singer

213
00:14:02.311 --> 00:14:05.572
I'd prance around the house
with an empty toilet paper roll-

214
00:14:05.572 --> 00:14:07.230
- What is this?

215
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.392
I thought we were going
to listen to music.

216
00:14:10.392 --> 00:14:13.153
- You've never heard of Jen Desmond?

217
00:14:13.153 --> 00:14:15.492
I love listening to her messages.

218
00:14:15.492 --> 00:14:16.992
- Jen Desmond? No.

219
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:20.923
- Can never hurt anyone

220
00:14:20.923 --> 00:14:24.090
to listen to an inspirational message.

221
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:25.999
- You know what?

222
00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.929
I changed my mind. We
can turn the radio off.

223
00:14:28.929 --> 00:14:33.221
- What? You have problem
with women preachers?

224
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:36.089
- [Jen] So these virgins
head out with their lambs...

225
00:14:36.089 --> 00:14:39.281
(peaceful acoustic music)

226
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:41.698
- So. tell me about yourself.

227
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.542
- You talkin' to me?

228
00:14:45.542 --> 00:14:47.709
- She's not talkin' to me.

229
00:14:48.856 --> 00:14:51.856
- (sighs) Yes. you.

230
00:14:53.039 --> 00:14:55.372
- Well. what you wanna know?

231
00:14:56.226 --> 00:14:59.476
- I don't know. What do you like to do?

232
00:15:02.345 --> 00:15:04.262
- I like to make money.

233
00:15:06.074 --> 00:15:06.907
- Come on.

234
00:15:07.915 --> 00:15:09.582
Do you like to read?

235
00:15:10.546 --> 00:15:11.629
Dance? Paint?

236
00:15:12.585 --> 00:15:15.105
- Maybe I like to paint.

237
00:15:15.105 --> 00:15:16.855
Maybe I like to draw.

238
00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:23.193
- Do you ever dream of
doing it professionally?

239
00:15:23.193 --> 00:15:27.265
- No. Right now. my only
concern is making money.

240
00:15:27.265 --> 00:15:31.355
- What about you? What's
your dreams. Ragan?

241
00:15:31.355 --> 00:15:36.266
- Right now. just to get
through the next three days.

242
00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:38.683
- Come on. What's your dream?

243
00:15:40.515 --> 00:15:41.598
Wait. I know.

244
00:15:42.675 --> 00:15:46.008
You wanna be a professional gold digger.

245
00:15:47.606 --> 00:15:49.106
No? That's not it?

246
00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:55.175
A Hooters waitress. A really good one.

247
00:15:55.175 --> 00:15:58.675
If you've not already worked there before.

248
00:16:00.774 --> 00:16:04.524
I know. uh. a vampire slayer. Like Buffy.

249
00:16:04.524 --> 00:16:06.524
You kinda look like her.

250
00:16:07.987 --> 00:16:09.737
That's not it either?

251
00:16:10.805 --> 00:16:11.638
Huh.

252
00:16:13.067 --> 00:16:15.287
An adult entertainer.

253
00:16:15.287 --> 00:16:17.704
- Why don't you just shut up?

254
00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.947
- Seriously. what's your dream?

255
00:16:23.947 --> 00:16:26.737
- If I tell you. will you just shut up?

256
00:16:26.737 --> 00:16:27.570
- Maybe.

257
00:16:28.519 --> 00:16:29.352
Maybe not.

258
00:16:31.745 --> 00:16:36.067
- Maybe I want to be an
advertising executive.

259
00:16:36.067 --> 00:16:41.067
But after today I might just
wanna become a contract killer.

260
00:16:42.867 --> 00:16:46.534
♪ Baby. in your loving arms ♪

261
00:16:47.551 --> 00:16:48.384
- Tyrese.

262
00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:52.880
You. uh... You ever do graffiti?

263
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.713
- Uh. no.

264
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:58.200
- Guess it's your time
of the month too. huh?

265
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.503
- Look. don't make me hurt you.

266
00:17:01.503 --> 00:17:03.569
- That's childish.

267
00:17:03.569 --> 00:17:06.411
I think the next time we stop.

268
00:17:06.411 --> 00:17:08.321
I'm gonna get you a coloring book.

269
00:17:08.321 --> 00:17:09.421
- How about the next time we stop.

270
00:17:09.421 --> 00:17:11.940
I'll color your face black and blue. hm?

271
00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.500
- (chuckles) Oh. a face painter!

272
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.008
Now. that is a talent.

273
00:17:16.008 --> 00:17:17.971
You could actually take that on the road.

274
00:17:17.971 --> 00:17:20.054
Uh. carnivals. festivals.

275
00:17:23.182 --> 00:17:24.530
- Keep talkin' and we can step outside

276
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.101
and handle this like men.

277
00:17:26.101 --> 00:17:28.099
- I'm not afraid of a face painter.

278
00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:32.211
- [Ragan] Come on. guys. We
don't have time for this.

279
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:33.461
- [Vin] Really?

280
00:17:38.826 --> 00:17:41.576
(car door slams)

281
00:17:49.745 --> 00:17:50.865
- Let's go!

282
00:17:50.865 --> 00:17:54.365
(upbeat electronic music)

283
00:18:10.099 --> 00:18:13.529
- Okay. Princess. Everything's ready.

284
00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:15.091
- Good.

285
00:18:15.091 --> 00:18:17.960
- Yeah. you're welcome. No problem.

286
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.293
I'll be outside.

287
00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:24.570
- You need anything else?

288
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.008
(Ragan sighs)
(melancholy piano music)

289
00:18:26.008 --> 00:18:26.841
- Nope.

290
00:18:31.258 --> 00:18:32.091
Uh. hey.

291
00:18:33.281 --> 00:18:34.738
Um...

292
00:18:34.738 --> 00:18:36.405
Thanks for the iPad.

293
00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:49.041
(melancholy piano music)

294
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.107
(rain splashes)

295
00:19:06.721 --> 00:19:09.804
(background chatter)

296
00:19:11.378 --> 00:19:13.096
- Hey. Mackenzie.
- Hey.

297
00:19:13.096 --> 00:19:14.416
Shh.

298
00:19:14.416 --> 00:19:15.249
- Okay.

299
00:19:20.898 --> 00:19:25.065
- I want you to really try
to memorize this stuff.

300
00:19:26.577 --> 00:19:27.889
Hey.

301
00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:28.870
Beautiful.

302
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.508
- How's it goin'?
- It's goin' okay.

303
00:19:31.508 --> 00:19:35.447
We still have a lot of things to bang out.

304
00:19:35.447 --> 00:19:39.280
- Well. we also have a
few things to bang out.

305
00:19:41.008 --> 00:19:42.106
I brought some candy.

306
00:19:42.106 --> 00:19:44.356
- Honey.
- Oh. I'm so sorry.

307
00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:46.814
I'm really sorry.

308
00:19:46.814 --> 00:19:48.481
- Please be careful.

309
00:19:52.877 --> 00:19:54.357
- Hey. do you think we could go outside

310
00:19:54.357 --> 00:19:56.607
and talk for a few minutes?

311
00:19:58.926 --> 00:20:01.426
- We can talk here. What's up?

312
00:20:03.927 --> 00:20:07.010
- Just wanted to tell you I love you.

313
00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:11.208
- I'm sorry. I just don't have time now.

314
00:20:26.213 --> 00:20:27.102
(door slams)

315
00:20:27.102 --> 00:20:28.303
- [Ragan] Confusion looks odd for a guy

316
00:20:28.303 --> 00:20:30.053
who knows everything.

317
00:20:33.543 --> 00:20:35.420
- Are you done?

318
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.913
- Go get the stuff so
we can go to the hotel.

319
00:20:38.913 --> 00:20:40.580
- Yes. Your Majesty.

320
00:20:44.439 --> 00:20:46.538
(switch clicks)

321
00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:47.371
My bed.

322
00:20:58.125 --> 00:21:01.308
- Officer Kent Barnes was
acquitted on all accounts in the

323
00:21:01.308 --> 00:21:04.782
shooting death of the unarmed
black motorist. Jessie Carvel.

324
00:21:04.782 --> 00:21:07.191
which was all caught on video.

325
00:21:07.191 --> 00:21:09.600
With us tonight are legal
experts Adam Johnston

326
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.360
and Max Pearson to discuss the verdict.

327
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.481
Adam. you first. What are your thoughts?

328
00:21:15.481 --> 00:21:19.329
- Any time human life is
lost. it is a terrible.

329
00:21:19.329 --> 00:21:23.161
terrible situation. and
this is no exception.

330
00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:26.530
But I believe the evidence
presented to the jury

331
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.398
and what the jury heard and saw.

332
00:21:29.398 --> 00:21:34.251
they had no other choice but
to exonerate Officer Barnes.

333
00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:36.918
And the truth is that Mr. Carvel

334
00:21:38.071 --> 00:21:41.272
did not comply with Officer Barnes.

335
00:21:41.272 --> 00:21:44.070
- [Anchor] Max. what about you?
Would you like to weigh in?

336
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.440
- I would first like to say that

337
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.579
what the police officer done was wrong.

338
00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:51.451
What is tragic was the injustice done

339
00:21:51.451 --> 00:21:54.432
to the life of an innocent man.

340
00:21:54.432 --> 00:21:57.840
Mr. Carvel posed no threat
to the police officer

341
00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.691
in the first place.

342
00:21:59.691 --> 00:22:02.832
The police in this community
have gotten away with

343
00:22:02.832 --> 00:22:07.832
harassment. beating and
arresting of African Americans

344
00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:12.091
without any probable cause
and gotten away with it.

345
00:22:12.091 --> 00:22:13.731
- Adam. I'm not sure the community

346
00:22:13.731 --> 00:22:14.820
would agree with the verdict.

347
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.179
We're seeing a lot of
widespread riots and looting.

348
00:22:18.179 --> 00:22:21.657
(protestors yell)

349
00:22:21.657 --> 00:22:22.490
- Animals.

350
00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:25.709
- What?

351
00:22:28.345 --> 00:22:30.876
- Animals destroying property.

352
00:22:30.876 --> 00:22:33.865
- So what you really trying to say?

353
00:22:33.865 --> 00:22:35.189
- What I'm trying to say is somebody

354
00:22:35.189 --> 00:22:38.408
needs to lock these thugs
up and throw away the key.

355
00:22:38.408 --> 00:22:39.748
- Hm.

356
00:22:39.748 --> 00:22:43.497
So you callin' 'em thugs. but
what do you really wanna say?

357
00:22:43.497 --> 00:22:45.738
(Vin chuckles)

358
00:22:45.738 --> 00:22:49.167
- Look. man. I'm not afraid of you.

359
00:22:49.167 --> 00:22:51.897
And your momma's not here to save you.

360
00:22:51.897 --> 00:22:52.730
- I'm gonna tell you.

361
00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.818
you got about five seconds
to get out my face.

362
00:22:55.818 --> 00:22:57.219
- Or what?

363
00:22:57.219 --> 00:22:59.789
- [Anchor] And there was
another drive-by shooting today

364
00:22:59.789 --> 00:23:02.089
downtown that appears to be gang related.

365
00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:04.589
but there are no suspects yet.

366
00:23:07.168 --> 00:23:09.251
(knocks)

367
00:23:10.448 --> 00:23:13.458
- Hey. I'm gonna go get some
dinner. You guys wanna go?

368
00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:16.228
- [Vin] Yeah. go be with your momma.

369
00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.395
- You just saved his life.

370
00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:26.612
(Vin sighs)

371
00:23:32.117 --> 00:23:35.663
(protestors yell)

372
00:23:35.663 --> 00:23:37.580
- [Protestor] Oh. yeah!

373
00:23:39.627 --> 00:23:43.803
- Do you have any of
your art on your phone?

374
00:23:43.803 --> 00:23:44.636
- Maybe.

375
00:23:59.079 --> 00:24:00.496
- I wanna see it.

376
00:24:08.362 --> 00:24:10.445
- [Tyrese] Just swipe it.

377
00:24:17.758 --> 00:24:19.591
- Wow. these are good.

378
00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:23.742
This is really. really good.

379
00:24:28.059 --> 00:24:30.979
This is not what I was expecting.

380
00:24:30.979 --> 00:24:33.960
- This is not what I expected. either.

381
00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.460
- You're talented.

382
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:43.132
Hey. have you ever thought
about doing graphic design?

383
00:24:43.132 --> 00:24:43.965
- What?

384
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.011
- Have you thought about
doing graphic design before?

385
00:24:48.011 --> 00:24:51.979
- No. I'd have to get a
computer and all the programs.

386
00:24:51.979 --> 00:24:54.759
Just ain't got the money.

387
00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:56.840
- You should look into it.

388
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.673
Seriously.

389
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.330
Aw. she's so cute.

390
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:05.750
Who is this?

391
00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:09.649
- That's my daughter.

392
00:25:18.735 --> 00:25:20.495
- Will you be dining alone today?

393
00:25:20.495 --> 00:25:21.614
- Yeah.

394
00:25:21.614 --> 00:25:24.895
- [Waitress] Can I bring you a drink menu?

395
00:25:24.895 --> 00:25:26.585
- I'll stick with water.

396
00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:30.335
- Okay. I'll be right
back to get your order.

397
00:25:34.697 --> 00:25:37.508
(peaceful acoustic music)

398
00:25:37.508 --> 00:25:39.539
- [Ragan] Are you good
friends with Yuliya?

399
00:25:39.539 --> 00:25:41.838
- We talk from time to time.

400
00:25:41.838 --> 00:25:44.879
At preschool. That's where our
kids are in class together.

401
00:25:44.879 --> 00:25:47.161
(phone vibrates)

402
00:25:47.161 --> 00:25:50.509
- Out of the blue. she just
offered you a temp job?

403
00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:54.098
- Well. I have sort of a situation.

404
00:25:54.098 --> 00:25:55.098
- Situation?

405
00:25:56.097 --> 00:26:00.680
What's your situation?
(phone vibrates)

406
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.753
- Money. Baby Mama drama.

407
00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:08.149
- Oh.

408
00:26:09.839 --> 00:26:11.006
Child support?

409
00:26:15.089 --> 00:26:19.719
Well. Yuliya. she's the
best. She got me my job. too.

410
00:26:19.719 --> 00:26:22.493
- So what exactly is your job?

411
00:26:22.493 --> 00:26:26.632
- (sighs) I'm just a fluff girl.

412
00:26:26.632 --> 00:26:28.121
- A what?

413
00:26:28.121 --> 00:26:33.121
- You know. I set up the
displays. and play the video.

414
00:26:33.133 --> 00:26:37.383
You know. give out things
and answer any questions.

415
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:43.370
- Oh. okay. Sounds like the
fluff girl really loves her job.

416
00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:46.499
- Yeah. just livin' the dream!

417
00:26:46.499 --> 00:26:49.249
(phone vibrates)

418
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.190
(phone vibrates)

419
00:26:57.253 --> 00:27:00.060
- [Phone] You have one new message.

420
00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.881
- [Jay] Hey. Ragan. Look. this is Jay.

421
00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:04.190
I need you to... Hold on.

422
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:08.361
Man. can't you see I'm on the phone? Yeah.

423
00:27:08.361 --> 00:27:09.693
All right. look.

424
00:27:09.693 --> 00:27:11.162
Look. this is Jay. I
need you to call me back

425
00:27:11.162 --> 00:27:13.373
so we can talk about this laptop thing.

426
00:27:13.373 --> 00:27:14.990
I'm really thinking that
this thing can be huge

427
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.980
and I'm not sure how long
they're gonna sit on it. so.

428
00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.139
you need to make a decision. all right?

429
00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:21.889
So call me. like now.

430
00:27:23.213 --> 00:27:25.713
(Ragan sighs)

431
00:27:27.364 --> 00:27:29.103
(phone rings)

432
00:27:29.103 --> 00:27:30.182
- Hey. Sheri.

433
00:27:30.182 --> 00:27:31.503
- Hey.

434
00:27:31.503 --> 00:27:33.102
We need to talk.

435
00:27:33.102 --> 00:27:35.182
I hope you're by yourself.

436
00:27:35.182 --> 00:27:36.432
- No. I can be.

437
00:27:39.012 --> 00:27:41.450
Could you just give me a minute?

438
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:44.033
(Jay chuckles)

439
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.713
(door opens)

440
00:27:47.713 --> 00:27:49.263
(door closes)

441
00:27:49.263 --> 00:27:50.346
What's wrong?

442
00:27:51.312 --> 00:27:55.812
- (sighs) I hope you're sitting down.

443
00:27:57.474 --> 00:27:59.840
- Hey. Ragan. they're ready...

444
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.442
What are you doin'?

445
00:28:01.442 --> 00:28:03.691
Why aren't you dressed?

446
00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:05.608
Time is money. come on!

447
00:28:10.733 --> 00:28:11.816
- 30 minutes.

448
00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:15.964
I need to get my mind together.

449
00:28:23.649 --> 00:28:24.515
(Jay sighs)

450
00:28:24.515 --> 00:28:27.098
(pills rattle)

451
00:28:29.442 --> 00:28:30.775
- Tell you what.

452
00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:37.341
You've got five minutes.

453
00:28:39.641 --> 00:28:42.058
You owe this time. all right?

454
00:28:45.163 --> 00:28:45.996
All right.

455
00:28:47.061 --> 00:28:49.561
(door closes)

456
00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.883
(upbeat acoustic music)

457
00:29:41.243 --> 00:29:42.410
- What's that?

458
00:29:49.798 --> 00:29:51.300
That's a good book.

459
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.050
I like Einstein. too.

460
00:29:54.009 --> 00:29:55.698
- Well. I guess liking Einstein

461
00:29:55.698 --> 00:29:58.865
doesn't make you smarter now. does it?

462
00:29:59.908 --> 00:30:02.241
(Vin sighs)

463
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.888
- What do you say we
put yesterday behind us?

464
00:30:09.888 --> 00:30:13.241
(Tyrese sighs)

465
00:30:13.241 --> 00:30:14.074
- Fine.

466
00:30:16.489 --> 00:30:17.322
- Okay.

467
00:30:20.199 --> 00:30:23.031
She's. uh. she's gonna
be in there for a while.

468
00:30:23.031 --> 00:30:25.198
You wanna go do somethin'?

469
00:30:26.469 --> 00:30:27.469
- Like what?

470
00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.429
- [Woman] Hey. guys. can I help you?

471
00:30:30.429 --> 00:30:32.349
- Yeah. we wanted to play a couple games.

472
00:30:32.349 --> 00:30:35.030
- Well. there's a tournament
going on right now. so...

473
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.259
- Can we get in?
- Whoa!

474
00:30:37.259 --> 00:30:39.610
You any good?
- Any good?

475
00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.959
Man. you gotta watch
and learn from the best.

476
00:30:42.959 --> 00:30:44.350
- Whatever.
(woman chuckles)

477
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.069
- Well. a team did just drop out.

478
00:30:46.069 --> 00:30:47.960
If you guys want. y'all
can take their place.

479
00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.460
$1.000 if you win.

480
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.873
Hey. here's your first ones.

481
00:30:59.152 --> 00:31:03.152
- (chuckles) It's on. you guys.

482
00:31:04.336 --> 00:31:06.919
(upbeat music)

483
00:31:18.346 --> 00:31:20.846
(balls clack)

484
00:31:25.873 --> 00:31:28.373
(balls clack)

485
00:31:37.606 --> 00:31:39.689
(groans)

486
00:31:41.155 --> 00:31:43.655
(balls clack)

487
00:32:04.323 --> 00:32:06.823
(balls clack)

488
00:32:12.595 --> 00:32:15.678
(spectators applaud)

489
00:32:28.655 --> 00:32:30.134
- Those guys were gonna meet us outside.

490
00:32:30.134 --> 00:32:31.037
The dude's arms were this huge.

491
00:32:31.037 --> 00:32:33.466
- Well. (chuckles) the swamp
people ain't gonna get you.

492
00:32:33.466 --> 00:32:34.877
(Vin chuckles)

493
00:32:34.877 --> 00:32:37.486
- [Ragan] What happened? Did
you two kiss and make up?

494
00:32:37.486 --> 00:32:39.124
- Why? Are you jealous?

495
00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:40.326
- You want another one?

496
00:32:40.326 --> 00:32:44.005
- (chuckles) No. we're good.

497
00:32:44.005 --> 00:32:45.747
- [Ragan] Get the stuff.

498
00:32:45.747 --> 00:32:48.655
- A real party I've ever had.

499
00:32:48.655 --> 00:32:52.435
All my life. I've had
to live quite simply.

500
00:32:52.435 --> 00:32:56.167
and now that I have money enough
to do everything I want...

501
00:32:56.167 --> 00:32:58.658
(phone rings)

502
00:32:58.658 --> 00:33:01.205
I really don't quite know how to start.

503
00:33:01.205 --> 00:33:04.546
- Hey. baby girl. How you doin'?

504
00:33:04.546 --> 00:33:07.058
Yeah. (chuckles)

505
00:33:07.058 --> 00:33:08.228
I miss you.

506
00:33:08.228 --> 00:33:10.401
- I miss you. too!
(knocks)

507
00:33:10.401 --> 00:33:13.393
I went to the store and
I took some pictures.

508
00:33:13.393 --> 00:33:18.393
- Daddy will be home soon. I
promise. All right. baby girl?

509
00:33:18.798 --> 00:33:20.293
What was that?

510
00:33:20.293 --> 00:33:21.293
What's that?

511
00:33:23.272 --> 00:33:24.105
- Hey. Tyrese.

512
00:33:24.105 --> 00:33:26.353
I'm gonna go get some
dinner. Do you wanna go?

513
00:33:26.353 --> 00:33:29.684
- No. I'm good. Y'all go ahead.

514
00:33:29.684 --> 00:33:30.517
- Wait.

515
00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:34.903
What about me?
- You look so pretty.

516
00:33:34.903 --> 00:33:36.486
I like that. Mm-hm.

517
00:33:37.563 --> 00:33:39.303
(Ragan sighs)

518
00:33:39.303 --> 00:33:41.782
- [Woman On TV] I don't remember.

519
00:33:41.782 --> 00:33:43.952
(man on TV blows his nose)

520
00:33:43.952 --> 00:33:46.433
(jazzy piano music)

521
00:33:46.433 --> 00:33:48.805
- No. thanks. I'm gonna stick with water.

522
00:33:48.805 --> 00:33:49.638
Thank you.

523
00:34:17.097 --> 00:34:17.930
- What?

524
00:34:22.009 --> 00:34:23.759
- You got me curious.

525
00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:28.580
- What do you mean?

526
00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.163
- I mean. your hair is perfect.

527
00:34:34.219 --> 00:34:36.136
your makeup is perfect.

528
00:34:37.169 --> 00:34:40.252
you're wearing a very elegant outfit.

529
00:34:42.388 --> 00:34:45.055
and you got a really nice shape.

530
00:34:47.888 --> 00:34:48.721
And those.

531
00:34:49.728 --> 00:34:51.200
Are those real?

532
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.033
- What?

533
00:34:53.368 --> 00:34:57.547
- I'm just saying. you
seem smarter than you look.

534
00:34:57.547 --> 00:34:58.380
- Really?

535
00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.440
(water splashes)

536
00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.773
Are you as dumb as you look?

537
00:35:06.621 --> 00:35:09.288
(traffic roars)

538
00:35:10.597 --> 00:35:11.430
- Ragan.

539
00:35:12.697 --> 00:35:14.177
Ragan. wait.

540
00:35:14.177 --> 00:35:15.148
Wait.

541
00:35:15.148 --> 00:35:17.699
- You are the biggest idiotic imbecile

542
00:35:17.699 --> 00:35:21.200
that I have ever met in my entire life.

543
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.677
- I think you misunderstood
what I'm trying to say.

544
00:35:23.677 --> 00:35:25.038
(Ragan scoffs)

545
00:35:25.038 --> 00:35:27.550
I just wanna know about the real you.

546
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.757
- Are you serious?

547
00:35:29.757 --> 00:35:31.869
That coming from a guy who points at these

548
00:35:31.869 --> 00:35:34.358
and asks me if they're real?

549
00:35:34.358 --> 00:35:36.441
- It was just a question!

550
00:35:41.508 --> 00:35:43.868
- Is that supposed to be an apology?

551
00:35:43.868 --> 00:35:44.868
- I'm sorry.

552
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.843
I shouldn't have said it.

553
00:35:52.118 --> 00:35:53.118
- Obviously.

554
00:35:56.497 --> 00:35:59.048
- What I was trying to say is

555
00:35:59.048 --> 00:36:04.048
I'm guessing that the real
Ragan is just as intelligent

556
00:36:04.299 --> 00:36:05.966
as she is beautiful.

557
00:36:09.838 --> 00:36:14.755
- Well. you sure have a weird
way of complimenting a woman.

558
00:36:16.138 --> 00:36:17.305
But thank you.

559
00:36:19.606 --> 00:36:21.189
- You still hungry?

560
00:36:23.728 --> 00:36:25.806
Just a little bit?

561
00:36:25.806 --> 00:36:26.639
Come on.

562
00:36:31.887 --> 00:36:32.839
You know I'm gonna get you back

563
00:36:32.839 --> 00:36:35.038
for throwin' that water in my face. right?

564
00:36:35.038 --> 00:36:37.686
- Don't threaten me. Next
time. it'll be a plate.

565
00:36:37.686 --> 00:36:40.439
- Today. in the midst of
the riots and protests.

566
00:36:40.439 --> 00:36:43.549
there has been another shooting
of an unarmed black man.

567
00:36:43.549 --> 00:36:46.109
and it was caught on video.

568
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:48.947
We are going to show you that footage.

569
00:36:48.947 --> 00:36:51.364
Viewer discretion is advised.

570
00:36:53.287 --> 00:36:56.287
(gun fires rapidly)

571
00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:04.282
- Guys. we've had a report of
several break-ins in the area

572
00:37:04.282 --> 00:37:06.100
and you guys fit the description.

573
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.000
- I fit the description?

574
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.262
- All right. guys. look. I'm
gonna need to see some IDs.

575
00:37:10.262 --> 00:37:12.282
Everybody get your IDs out for me. please.

576
00:37:12.282 --> 00:37:13.365
- Oh. my God.

577
00:37:18.002 --> 00:37:19.130
- [Officer] All right.
you guys just hold tight.

578
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.130
I'm gonna be right back.

579
00:37:24.189 --> 00:37:26.096
- Think these are the guys?

580
00:37:26.096 --> 00:37:28.948
- Think so.
- Oh. man. this never fails.

581
00:37:28.948 --> 00:37:31.781
(muffled chatter)

582
00:37:36.518 --> 00:37:39.268
- Let's go get these guys.
- Okay.

583
00:37:42.527 --> 00:37:46.027
I need you boys to get out of the vehicle.

584
00:38:01.248 --> 00:38:04.248
(smooth jazz music)

585
00:38:13.147 --> 00:38:15.487
- Stacy better not be there.
- What's wrong with Stacy?

586
00:38:15.487 --> 00:38:17.436
I thought-
- "What's wrong with Stacy?"

587
00:38:17.436 --> 00:38:19.097
Are you serious?

588
00:38:19.097 --> 00:38:21.054
I do not like that girl
and if she's at my...

589
00:38:21.054 --> 00:38:22.345
(box clatters)

590
00:38:22.345 --> 00:38:23.975
Kim!

591
00:38:23.975 --> 00:38:24.808
Really?

592
00:38:29.615 --> 00:38:31.424
Thank you.
- No problem.

593
00:38:31.424 --> 00:38:32.924
- [Kim] Thank you.

594
00:38:40.993 --> 00:38:43.455
- Where am I taking this to?

595
00:38:43.455 --> 00:38:46.622
- Ballroom A. right around the corner?

596
00:38:53.561 --> 00:38:55.859
Thank you so much.

597
00:38:55.859 --> 00:38:58.399
I'm Melanie and this is Kim.

598
00:38:58.399 --> 00:38:59.649
- Hey.
- Tyrese.

599
00:39:00.798 --> 00:39:03.127
So. uh. is this a sweet 16 party?

600
00:39:03.127 --> 00:39:04.219
- You're funny.

601
00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:05.510
A party? Yes.

602
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.768
But a sweet 16? No.

603
00:39:07.768 --> 00:39:10.799
You should come by tonight.
Bring your girlfriend?

604
00:39:10.799 --> 00:39:12.407
- (chuckles) You funny.

605
00:39:12.407 --> 00:39:14.077
No. I'm just in town on a business trip

606
00:39:14.077 --> 00:39:15.379
with a couple of co-workers.

607
00:39:15.379 --> 00:39:16.679
- Where you from. Tyrese?

608
00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:17.596
- ATL.
- Oh!

609
00:39:18.488 --> 00:39:20.758
We love Atlanta.
- Mm-hm.

610
00:39:20.758 --> 00:39:23.754
Yeah. we've had some
crazy nights in Atlanta.

611
00:39:23.754 --> 00:39:26.629
- For real?
- No. not that crazy.

612
00:39:26.629 --> 00:39:28.978
But you should come by tonight.

613
00:39:28.978 --> 00:39:31.487
Bring your co-workers? Starts at nine.

614
00:39:31.487 --> 00:39:33.468
- Well. it depends.

615
00:39:33.468 --> 00:39:36.767
- Depends on what?
- On how crazy you guys get.

616
00:39:36.767 --> 00:39:39.918
- Well. I guess you will just
have to come and find out.

617
00:39:39.918 --> 00:39:41.251
- [Melanie] Bye.

618
00:39:42.607 --> 00:39:44.837
- So what time are we
leavin' in the morning?

619
00:39:44.837 --> 00:39:47.366
- We need to leave around six.

620
00:39:47.366 --> 00:39:51.116
That'll give us time to
get there and set up.

621
00:39:53.206 --> 00:39:55.016
- Hey. wait a minute.

622
00:39:55.016 --> 00:39:58.446
I need to talk to that guy over there.

623
00:39:58.446 --> 00:39:59.363
- What guy?

624
00:40:00.448 --> 00:40:03.997
- Will you just turn around. please?

625
00:40:03.997 --> 00:40:06.747
(crickets chirp)

626
00:40:13.346 --> 00:40:15.775
(car door opens)

627
00:40:15.775 --> 00:40:17.856
(car door closes)

628
00:40:17.856 --> 00:40:21.273
(melancholy piano music)

629
00:40:26.302 --> 00:40:27.135
Hey. man.

630
00:40:28.903 --> 00:40:29.736
- Hey.

631
00:40:31.062 --> 00:40:32.820
- You hungry?

632
00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:33.903
- Yeah. yeah.

633
00:40:34.922 --> 00:40:35.903
Thanks.

634
00:40:35.903 --> 00:40:38.736
- No problem. Just some leftovers.

635
00:40:44.431 --> 00:40:46.348
So. where do you sleep?

636
00:40:48.471 --> 00:40:49.304
- Um...

637
00:40:51.262 --> 00:40:52.179
It depends.

638
00:40:54.192 --> 00:40:56.775
Under bridges. cardboard boxes.

639
00:40:57.971 --> 00:41:02.388
And when it's freezing out.
I'll sleep in a dumpster.

640
00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.653
- You ever get into shelter anywhere?

641
00:41:08.843 --> 00:41:10.801
- They're always full. you know?

642
00:41:10.801 --> 00:41:14.384
And I'm kinda better
off keepin' to myself.

643
00:41:15.244 --> 00:41:17.580
So I've got a sign. though.

644
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.747
and I wave it around and ask for help.

645
00:41:21.821 --> 00:41:24.340
But most people just walk by

646
00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:29.173
and they don't take the time
of day to help a bum like me.

647
00:41:30.903 --> 00:41:32.486
- You're not a bum.

648
00:41:33.712 --> 00:41:35.462
You're a human being.

649
00:41:46.095 --> 00:41:46.928
Here.

650
00:41:49.146 --> 00:41:51.729
(man chuckles)

651
00:41:55.935 --> 00:41:57.268
- God bless you.

652
00:41:58.106 --> 00:41:58.939
Yeah.

653
00:42:01.007 --> 00:42:02.590
- God bless us all.

654
00:42:03.734 --> 00:42:05.651
I wish I could do more.

655
00:42:06.866 --> 00:42:09.699
- You know. you could pray for me.

656
00:42:18.493 --> 00:42:21.563
- [Vin] Lord. I pray you protect this man.

657
00:42:21.563 --> 00:42:24.980
Lord. I pray you keep him safe. Lord God.

658
00:42:27.597 --> 00:42:32.056
- That was wonderful what
you did with that guy.

659
00:42:32.056 --> 00:42:34.973
I've never prayed in public before.

660
00:42:36.134 --> 00:42:36.967
- Never?

661
00:42:39.367 --> 00:42:40.200
- Never.

662
00:42:42.405 --> 00:42:45.367
- Yeah. I guess whenever
I see somebody homeless.

663
00:42:45.367 --> 00:42:49.117
I just try to help them
out as much as I can.

664
00:42:50.016 --> 00:42:50.849
- Why?

665
00:42:53.476 --> 00:42:57.166
- Well. let's just say I had a
friend who was a youth pastor

666
00:42:57.166 --> 00:42:59.833
who ended living on the streets.

667
00:43:00.907 --> 00:43:02.324
- A youth pastor?

668
00:43:03.336 --> 00:43:04.503
What happened?

669
00:43:06.546 --> 00:43:07.797
(Vin sighs)

670
00:43:07.797 --> 00:43:09.714
- Well. he was married.

671
00:43:13.167 --> 00:43:15.416
Had a great life.

672
00:43:15.416 --> 00:43:16.333
A good job.

673
00:43:18.635 --> 00:43:21.845
He and his wife hit a rough spot.

674
00:43:21.845 --> 00:43:25.343
And he came home one day to
an empty house and a Dear John

675
00:43:25.343 --> 00:43:29.260
letter sayin' that she
had found somebody else.

676
00:43:31.255 --> 00:43:32.755
- Oh. my goodness.

677
00:43:36.003 --> 00:43:38.630
- Yeah. it wrecked him.

678
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:41.380
He kinda lost hope in everything.

679
00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:45.425
Started drinking a lot.

680
00:43:45.425 --> 00:43:49.465
Lost contact with his
parents in Nashville.

681
00:43:49.465 --> 00:43:50.548
Lost his job.

682
00:43:52.792 --> 00:43:54.907
And in three months. he
was a full-blown alcoholic.

683
00:43:54.907 --> 00:43:56.740
living on the streets.

684
00:44:00.834 --> 00:44:05.754
- Where is he at now?
(Vin chuckles)

685
00:44:05.754 --> 00:44:09.347
- Well. for months. he
slept on the wet concrete.

686
00:44:09.347 --> 00:44:12.403
rats runnin' around his head.

687
00:44:12.403 --> 00:44:16.124
and one day. a ministry
group was handing out food

688
00:44:16.124 --> 00:44:19.616
and they offered to help him out.

689
00:44:19.616 --> 00:44:22.913
- So he took the help?
- He did.

690
00:44:22.913 --> 00:44:26.996
And two days from now.
he'll be six-months sober.

691
00:44:32.706 --> 00:44:35.706
- And did he get back with his wife?

692
00:44:38.964 --> 00:44:42.003
- No. he just wanted to disappear.

693
00:44:42.003 --> 00:44:44.343
He decided to hike the Appalachian Trail

694
00:44:44.343 --> 00:44:47.094
and when his money ran out.

695
00:44:47.094 --> 00:44:49.946
he found a small town nearby to live in

696
00:44:49.946 --> 00:44:53.029
and nobody ever heard from him again.

697
00:44:55.904 --> 00:44:57.737
- That's a sad ending.

698
00:45:01.671 --> 00:45:04.004
Maybe he'll find love again.

699
00:45:06.424 --> 00:45:07.257
- Yeah.

700
00:45:08.304 --> 00:45:09.137
Maybe.

701
00:45:17.768 --> 00:45:18.685
This is me.

702
00:45:19.779 --> 00:45:21.446
- I'm down the hall.

703
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.013
- Truce?

704
00:45:30.452 --> 00:45:32.952
(door creaks)

705
00:45:37.572 --> 00:45:38.972
(door creaks)

706
00:45:38.972 --> 00:45:41.101
(door closes)

707
00:45:41.101 --> 00:45:43.601
(door creaks)

708
00:45:45.833 --> 00:45:48.976
- Anyways. I just got
invited to a party downstairs

709
00:45:48.976 --> 00:45:50.993
by some girls I ran into in the lobby.

710
00:45:50.993 --> 00:45:52.775
Do you guys wanna go?
- I don't know.

711
00:45:52.775 --> 00:45:56.545
We have to be outta here
by six in the morning.

712
00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:58.964
- Come on. I mean. we can go.

713
00:45:58.964 --> 00:46:00.644
Let's just not stay late.

714
00:46:00.644 --> 00:46:02.394
- I mean. it's okay if you guys

715
00:46:02.394 --> 00:46:04.136
need a little bit of alone time.

716

00:46:49.276 --> 00:46:51.177
- Ladies and gentlemen.

721
00:46:51.177 --> 00:46:55.017
Let's raise our glasses
and toast our graduate.

(birds tweet)

744
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:23.480
- [Vin] Three creams. three sugars. right?

745
00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.056
- Yes. Thank you.

746
00:48:25.056 --> 00:48:26.973
- [Vin] You're welcome.

747
00:48:32.139 --> 00:48:32.972
- Ew.

748
00:48:34.796 --> 00:48:38.318
Did you put salt in my coffee?
(Vin chuckles)

749
00:48:38.318 --> 00:48:41.469
You did put salt in my coffee!
- I told you I'd get you back.

750
00:48:41.469 --> 00:48:42.302
- Oh!

751
00:48:43.359 --> 00:48:46.871
(sighs) You butt head.

752
00:48:46.871 --> 00:48:49.371
(phone rings)

753
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:52.422
Hello?

754
00:48:55.478 --> 00:48:56.811
Are you serious?

755
00:48:59.917 --> 00:49:02.084
We're just 20 minutes out.

756
00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.743
I just needed one more sale.

757
00:49:09.102 --> 00:49:12.312
(sighs) Okay.

758
00:49:12.312 --> 00:49:13.145
Bye.

759
00:49:16.965 --> 00:49:19.965
Well. our last meeting was canceled.

760
00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:25.157
Don't worry. it's not
gonna affect your pay.

761
00:49:29.529 --> 00:49:33.491
Hey. don't your parents live in Nashville?

762
00:49:33.491 --> 00:49:35.096
- Possibly.

763
00:49:35.096 --> 00:49:35.929
Why?

764
00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:38.806
- Well. when was the
last time you saw them?

765
00:49:38.806 --> 00:49:40.457
- Let's not go there.

766
00:49:40.457 --> 00:49:43.246
- Every parent wants to see their child.

767
00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:46.829
- Come on. man! You
look like a mama's boy.

768
00:49:47.885 --> 00:49:49.385
- Give 'em a call.

769
00:49:58.042 --> 00:50:00.853
(doorbell rings)

770
00:50:00.853 --> 00:50:02.583
- There's my Winnie!

771
00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:04.583
Come here. baby!

772
00:50:04.583 --> 00:50:07.512
Oh! (chuckles)

773
00:50:07.512 --> 00:50:09.085
Well. who are your friends?

774
00:50:09.085 --> 00:50:09.962
- This is Ragan.

775
00:50:09.962 --> 00:50:11.005
- Hi.
- Hey. Ragan.

776
00:50:11.005 --> 00:50:13.083
- And this Tyrese.
- Hi. Tyrese.

777
00:50:13.083 --> 00:50:14.434
I'm Maggie.

778
00:50:14.434 --> 00:50:15.351
Come on in!

779
00:50:20.656 --> 00:50:22.267
- This is gorgeous.

780
00:50:22.267 --> 00:50:25.067
I love the design.
- Oh. thank you.

781
00:50:25.067 --> 00:50:26.856
Well. can I get you
guys something to drink?

782
00:50:26.856 --> 00:50:29.315
I have some sweet tea.

783
00:50:29.315 --> 00:50:30.627
Okay. great!

784
00:50:30.627 --> 00:50:33.552
Well. go on in! Sit down
and I'll be right back.

785
00:50:33.552 --> 00:50:36.885
- Maggie. let me help you.
- Okay. great.

786
00:50:39.866 --> 00:50:43.366
(peaceful acoustic music)

787
00:50:51.896 --> 00:50:53.513
- What?

788
00:50:53.513 --> 00:50:55.922
- "Winnie"?
(Vin scoffs)

789
00:50:55.922 --> 00:50:57.172
- Shut up. man.

790
00:50:58.064 --> 00:50:59.231
- Is that you?

791
00:51:02.909 --> 00:51:04.545
- [Vin] That was a long time ago.

792
00:51:04.545 --> 00:51:05.378
- Oh. man.

793
00:51:09.595 --> 00:51:12.428
- Hey you go. honey.
- Thanks. Mom.

794
00:51:13.688 --> 00:51:15.987
- I am so glad you're here.

795
00:51:15.987 --> 00:51:18.654
I missed you.
- I missed you too.

796
00:51:20.236 --> 00:51:21.567
Mom. where's Dad at?

797
00:51:21.567 --> 00:51:23.414
- I called him and told
him you were coming.

798
00:51:23.414 --> 00:51:24.987
so he's on his way.

799
00:51:24.987 --> 00:51:27.094
- All right.
- Oh. I think I hear him.

800
00:51:27.094 --> 00:51:29.594
(door closes)

801
00:51:31.825 --> 00:51:33.294
- Son.

802
00:51:33.294 --> 00:51:34.211
- Hey. Dad.

803
00:51:41.055 --> 00:51:42.733
Dad. these are my friends.

804
00:51:42.733 --> 00:51:44.206
This is Tyrese.

805
00:51:44.206 --> 00:51:46.318
- Tyrese.
- And this is Ragan.

806
00:51:46.318 --> 00:51:48.901
- Ragan. Good to meet you both.

807
00:51:52.416 --> 00:51:54.249
It's been a long time.

808
00:51:56.105 --> 00:51:57.974
- Yeah. it has.

809
00:51:57.974 --> 00:51:59.319
You'd be proud of me. Dad.

810
00:51:59.319 --> 00:52:01.608
I'll be sober six months tomorrow.

811
00:52:01.608 --> 00:52:03.738
- Congratulations!

812
00:52:03.738 --> 00:52:08.058
You oughta call Mackenzie
and let her know.

813
00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:10.053
(Vin sighs)

814
00:52:10.053 --> 00:52:12.663
- Dad. that chapter's over.

815
00:52:12.663 --> 00:52:16.260
- Now. son. are you really
gonna throw everything

816
00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:20.927
down the drain because of a
couple of bumps in the road?

817
00:52:27.573 --> 00:52:30.542
- Well. it was nice to see you. Dad.

818
00:52:30.542 --> 00:52:32.852
Mom. it was really nice to see you.

819
00:52:32.852 --> 00:52:34.685
Thank you for the tea.

820
00:52:35.788 --> 00:52:37.253
We gotta get goin'.

821
00:52:37.253 --> 00:52:40.172
- So soon? Oh. honey. can't
you stay a little longer?

822
00:52:40.172 --> 00:52:45.172
- Son. Son. how long are you
gonna run away from everything?

823
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:48.572
- Winston. Maggie. it
was so nice to meet you.

824
00:52:48.572 --> 00:52:49.803
Thank you for the tea.

825
00:52:49.803 --> 00:52:54.636
- Yeah. thank you guys. but
we better catch little Winnie.

826
00:52:55.651 --> 00:52:56.484
- What?

827
00:53:06.826 --> 00:53:09.743
- Pull over. I'm gonna talk to him.

828
00:53:12.165 --> 00:53:12.998
Vin.

829
00:53:14.937 --> 00:53:16.020
Vin. wait up.

830
00:53:23.306 --> 00:53:25.806
My parents get on my case too.

831
00:53:29.214 --> 00:53:30.456
- I just don't need to be reminded

832
00:53:30.456 --> 00:53:32.956
of how much of a failure I am.

833
00:53:35.187 --> 00:53:37.104
- You're not a failure.

834
00:53:38.145 --> 00:53:40.615
Everybody falls short.

835
00:53:40.615 --> 00:53:43.233
But not everybody got
back up like you did.

836
00:53:43.233 --> 00:53:46.035
(Vin sighs)

837
00:53:46.035 --> 00:53:48.334
And tomorrow will be six months.

838
00:53:48.334 --> 00:53:51.667
That doesn't sound like a failure to me.

839
00:53:56.842 --> 00:54:01.123
- Every day. I want to drink.
(melancholy piano music)

840
00:54:01.123 --> 00:54:02.123
But I don't.

841
00:54:04.704 --> 00:54:06.871
I want to drink right now.

842
00:54:08.956 --> 00:54:10.373
I'm not going to.

843
00:54:13.322 --> 00:54:16.235
I just can't go back to the
darkest place of my life.

844
00:54:16.235 --> 00:54:19.985
- Well. where do you
want to go in your life?

845
00:54:23.295 --> 00:54:24.545
- I don't know.

846
00:54:25.535 --> 00:54:27.616
But I can't go back.

847
00:54:27.616 --> 00:54:28.449
- Good.

848
00:54:34.264 --> 00:54:38.895
Do you remember that female
preacher that you hate so much?

849
00:54:38.895 --> 00:54:42.746
Well. she's gonna be preaching
at a church later on tonight.

850
00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:45.217
We should go check her out.

851
00:54:45.217 --> 00:54:47.405
And then we can go home.

852
00:54:47.405 --> 00:54:50.745
- Okay. and what do we do until then?

853
00:54:50.745 --> 00:54:54.611
- Well. Winnie. why don't you
show us around Music City?

854
00:54:54.611 --> 00:54:56.939

855

(Vin moans)

856
00:55:00.979 --> 00:55:03.646
- Right this way. Your Highness.

857
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:06.671

that you think that you have
that you think will stop God

886
00:57:06.398 --> 00:57:09.449
from working out his plan in your life?

00:57:09.449 --> 00:57:13.699
Those things do not stand
in the way of our master.

00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:17.578
God loves imperfect people.

889
00:57:17.578 --> 00:57:19.017
- Yeah.

890
00:57:19.017 --> 00:57:22.509
- He doesn't look at outward appearances.

00:57:24.614 --> 00:57:26.197

But now. I'm found.

894
00:57:31.841 --> 00:57:32.841
I was blind.

895
00:57:34.191 --> 00:57:36.550
but hallelujah. now I see!

896
00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:40.467
(audience cheers and applauds)

897
00:57:42.411 --> 00:57:45.911
Imperfect people are a part of God's plan.

898
00:57:48.671 --> 00:57:51.254
So stop running from your pain!

899
00:57:53.664 --> 00:57:56.497
And praise God in the midst of it.

900
00:57:58.433 --> 00:58:00.016
He is what we need!

901
00:58:02.222 --> 00:58:03.389
You need love?

902
00:58:04.322 --> 00:58:05.239
He is love.

903
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.043
You need the power to forgive?

904
00:58:10.043 --> 00:58:12.981
Oh. he'll give you the
strength to forgive.

905
00:58:12.981 --> 00:58:17.223
if you ask him and if
you believe him for it.

906
00:58:17.223 --> 00:58:18.556
Jesus is enough!

907
00:58:20.225 --> 00:58:21.392
God is enough!

908
00:58:23.031 --> 00:58:25.531
Say it with me! God is enough!

909
00:58:26.924 --> 00:58:29.431
- [Audience] God is enough.

910
00:58:29.431 --> 00:58:31.025
- I am enough!

911
00:58:31.025 --> 00:58:32.511
- [Audience] I am enough.

912
00:58:32.511 --> 00:58:35.672
- I have enough!
- I have enough.

913
00:58:35.672 --> 00:58:38.534
- I can do all things through Christ.

914
00:58:38.534 --> 00:58:41.303
because he strengthens me!

915
00:58:41.303 --> 00:58:42.671
Then do it.

916
00:58:42.671 --> 00:58:46.791
Praise the name of the
living God. Hallelujah!

917
00:58:46.791 --> 00:58:50.208
(melancholy piano music)

918
00:59:16.723 --> 00:59:19.390
- Look at him. He is passed out.

919
00:59:20.632 --> 00:59:22.503
(Vin and Ragan chuckle)

920
00:59:22.503 --> 00:59:24.513
Wake up. Tyrese. We're here.

921
00:59:24.513 --> 00:59:27.064
(phone vibrates)

922
00:59:27.064 --> 00:59:29.472
(phone chimes)

923
00:59:29.472 --> 00:59:32.055
(phone chimes)

924
00:59:36.534 --> 00:59:39.284
(car door slams)

925
00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:45.141
(car door slams)

926
00:59:45.141 --> 00:59:46.641
Hey. are you okay?

927
00:59:48.382 --> 00:59:49.462
- [Vin] I'm fine.

928
00:59:49.462 --> 00:59:51.281
- Are you sure?

929
00:59:51.281 --> 00:59:53.448
You don't look fine to me.

930
00:59:54.988 --> 00:59:58.790
- What do you know?
You're just a dumb model.

931
00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:00.457
You're not a shrink.

932
01:00:04.181 --> 01:00:06.181
(sighs)

933
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:17.113
- It was a pleasure working with you.

934
01:00:24.227 --> 01:00:25.060
- Ragan!

935
01:00:27.058 --> 01:00:28.058
Ragan. wait.

936
01:00:29.997 --> 01:00:30.830
I'm sorry.

937
01:00:32.479 --> 01:00:33.658
I didn't mean it.

938
01:00:33.658 --> 01:00:34.491
- Hush.

939
01:00:35.707 --> 01:00:38.584
Some of this may be fake...

940
01:00:38.584 --> 01:00:39.417
But this?

941
01:00:40.305 --> 01:00:41.388
This is real.

942
01:00:44.887 --> 01:00:49.637
I wish I never met you. and
I hope I never see you again.

943
01:00:56.857 --> 01:00:59.066
No wonder your wife left you.

944
01:00:59.066 --> 01:01:01.233
You're a drunk and a jerk.

945
01:01:07.338 --> 01:01:08.255
- Mm-mm-mm.

946
01:01:10.127 --> 01:01:11.627
White people.

947
01:01:11.627 --> 01:01:14.960
(somber acoustic music)

948
01:01:37.538 --> 01:01:40.038
(door creaks)

949
01:02:24.669 --> 01:02:27.339
(suspenseful music)

950
01:02:27.339 --> 01:02:28.973
(chains clink)

951
01:02:28.973 --> 01:02:31.473
(Ragan pants)

952
01:02:37.365 --> 01:02:39.036
(Ragan coughs)

953
01:02:39.036 --> 01:02:41.966
(ominous tones)

954
01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:45.249
- You're not strong
enough to break them all.

955
01:02:45.249 --> 01:02:46.821
- What do you want?

956
01:02:46.821 --> 01:02:51.443
(man chuckles)
(ominous tones)

957
01:02:51.443 --> 01:02:52.526
- Everything.

958
01:02:57.054 --> 01:03:00.137
(somber piano music)

959
01:03:08.459 --> 01:03:11.876
(Tyrese breathes deeply)

960
01:03:29.453 --> 01:03:31.536
(knocks)

961
01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:38.552
(switch clicks)

962
01:03:38.552 --> 01:03:40.341
- Tyrese Grant?

963
01:03:40.341 --> 01:03:41.502
- Yeah.

964
01:03:41.502 --> 01:03:43.252
- You've been served.

965
01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:48.848
(door slams)

966
01:03:53.063 --> 01:03:56.146
(somber piano music)

967
01:04:01.284 --> 01:04:03.867
(Tyrese sighs)

968
01:04:27.952 --> 01:04:31.452
- [Homeless Man] Thank you. God bless you.

969
01:04:47.443 --> 01:04:50.526
(background chatter)

970
01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:03.797
(keyboard clacks)

971
01:05:08.650 --> 01:05:11.233
(mouse clicks)

972
01:05:12.472 --> 01:05:15.555
(pen clicks rapidly)

973
01:05:25.232 --> 01:05:28.430
- So you don't have any experience?

974
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:32.347
- No. but I'm a fast
learner and a hard worker.

975
01:05:34.002 --> 01:05:37.085
(pen clicks rapidly)

976
01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.239
- This says you have a criminal record?

977
01:05:47.239 --> 01:05:50.539
- Yeah. but it's just for child support.

978
01:05:50.539 --> 01:05:52.956
(pen clicks)

979
01:05:58.527 --> 01:06:01.919
- Between me and you. our company normally

980
01:06:01.919 --> 01:06:05.586
doesn't hire anybody
with a criminal record.

981
01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:08.720
And even if I bypass your record.

982
01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.358
this job requires someone with experience.

983
01:06:12.358 --> 01:06:15.441
(somber piano music)

984
01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:22.877
Tell you what.

985
01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:29.127
I'm gonna look at a
couple of other people.

986
01:06:29.127 --> 01:06:31.869
And we'll just see. okay?

987
01:06:31.869 --> 01:06:33.520
- Okay.

988
01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.353
Thank you.

989
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:40.179
- Hey. Greg.

990
01:06:40.179 --> 01:06:42.537
- Hey. Ragan. So how'd it go?

991
01:06:42.537 --> 01:06:44.254
- I was one short of making my quota.

992
01:06:44.254 --> 01:06:47.049
but the last meeting was
canceled. so it's not my fault.

993
01:06:47.049 --> 01:06:51.098
And I did put up with Vin!
Doesn't that count for anything?

994
01:06:51.098 --> 01:06:54.515
And I got a few more promising referrals.

995
01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:58.598
- That's good. Ragan. Good.

996
01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.098
(door closes)

997
01:07:06.388 --> 01:07:08.217
- Look. Greg. I think I would do

998
01:07:08.217 --> 01:07:10.575
much better in the advertising department.

999
01:07:10.575 --> 01:07:13.449
- [Greg] Ragan. can't
you see I'm busy here?

1000
01:07:13.449 --> 01:07:15.038
Can this wait?

1001
01:07:15.038 --> 01:07:17.636
- Wait? How long do I have to wait?

1002
01:07:17.636 --> 01:07:22.327
I have been trying to talk to
you about this for months now.

1003
01:07:22.327 --> 01:07:24.083
What are you lookin' at?

1004
01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:25.572
- Wow.

1005
01:07:25.572 --> 01:07:27.723
- Ragan. look. I mean no disrespect.

1006
01:07:27.723 --> 01:07:30.231
but advertising is a tough field.

1007
01:07:30.231 --> 01:07:33.853
and it takes a lot of. a lot of. um-

1008
01:07:33.853 --> 01:07:35.461
- Brains?

1009
01:07:35.461 --> 01:07:37.101
- (sighs) Ragan. come on.

1010
01:07:37.101 --> 01:07:38.573
- Come on?

1011
01:07:38.573 --> 01:07:41.873
(sighs) You know what? I hate this job.

1012
01:07:41.873 --> 01:07:46.873
I hate your goofy haircut. I
hate the sound of your voice.

1013
01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:51.017
But most of all. I hate
the way you talk to me!

1014
01:07:52.218 --> 01:07:55.801
(playful orchestral music)

1015
01:08:01.389 --> 01:08:02.359
(water splashes)

1016
01:08:02.359 --> 01:08:03.942
By the way. I quit.

1017
01:08:08.277 --> 01:08:09.279
- Wow.

1018
01:08:09.279 --> 01:08:10.239
(Greg sighs)

1019
01:08:10.239 --> 01:08:11.825
- Fans saw you missed the goal.

1020
01:08:11.825 --> 01:08:13.359
Don't make no difference
whether you missed the goal.

1021
01:08:13.359 --> 01:08:16.889
The fans are goin'. "Slow.
you missed!" A miss is a miss!

1022
01:08:16.889 --> 01:08:19.620
(chatter from TV)

1023
01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:21.507
- [Woman On TV] And off
the streets where...

1024
01:08:21.507 --> 01:08:23.768
- Barnum. you're entirely too linear!

1025
01:08:23.768 --> 01:08:28.768
(knocks)
(melancholy piano music)

1026
01:08:31.501 --> 01:08:34.246
(door creaks)

1027
01:08:34.246 --> 01:08:35.079
- Hi.

1028
01:08:37.555 --> 01:08:39.138
Can we talk inside?

1029
01:08:40.623 --> 01:08:42.174
- [Man On TV] And educate the youngsters

1030
01:08:42.174 --> 01:08:44.007
towards a better life.

1031
01:08:45.264 --> 01:08:46.597
Joy out of life.

1032
01:08:47.595 --> 01:08:49.178
- [Vin] Let's walk.

1033
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:56.060
(somber music)
(crickets chirp)

1034
01:09:03.704 --> 01:09:07.371
- Doesn't that remind
you of our first date?

1035
01:09:08.316 --> 01:09:10.983
(woman giggles)

1036
01:09:16.203 --> 01:09:17.786
- Why are you here?

1037
01:09:18.796 --> 01:09:22.873
- I just came to see if
you wanted some candy.

1038
01:09:22.873 --> 01:09:24.773
(Vin sighs)

1039
01:09:24.773 --> 01:09:26.023
- No. I'm good.

1040
01:09:31.992 --> 01:09:34.075
- Your parents called me.

1041
01:09:35.054 --> 01:09:36.554
How have you been?

1042
01:09:38.192 --> 01:09:39.901
- How do you think I've been?

1043
01:09:39.901 --> 01:09:43.152
I mean. it's been wonderful
livin' a roach motel.

1044
01:09:43.152 --> 01:09:44.485
It's been great.

1045
01:09:54.353 --> 01:09:55.186
- Look.

1046
01:09:59.685 --> 01:10:02.753
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1047
01:10:02.753 --> 01:10:05.086
But I wanna make this right.

1048
01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:19.780
- Why didn't you say all this
before you cheated on me?

1049
01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:22.102
- Sometimes when you're lonely
and hurt and vulnerable.

1050
01:10:22.102 --> 01:10:23.992
you do things you regret.
(Vin sighs)

1051
01:10:23.992 --> 01:10:26.992
But I promise you. it meant nothing.

1052
01:10:32.159 --> 01:10:35.732
- I really don't have time for this today.

1053
01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.802
Will you just leave?

1054
01:10:37.802 --> 01:10:38.635
Please?

1055
01:10:40.137 --> 01:10:41.804
And don't come back.

1056
01:10:55.563 --> 01:10:58.181
- I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1057
01:10:58.181 --> 01:11:01.431
I just hope one day you can forgive me.

1058
01:11:07.829 --> 01:11:10.162
(Vin sighs)

1059
01:11:15.412 --> 01:11:18.079
(woman giggles)

1060
01:11:25.485 --> 01:11:27.985
(chip clinks)

1061
01:12:06.384 --> 01:12:08.827
(somber acoustic music)

1062
01:12:08.827 --> 01:12:12.049
(photos clatter)

1063
01:12:12.049 --> 01:12:15.216
(Vin breathes deeply)

1064
01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:33.043
(bright piano music)

1065
01:12:54.301 --> 01:12:56.001
- Hey. Jay.
- Hey.

1066
01:12:56.001 --> 01:12:57.392
Hey. girl.

1067
01:12:57.392 --> 01:12:59.819
Look. I'm glad you came. I'm glad.

1068
01:12:59.819 --> 01:13:04.262
Listen. you don't have
anything to worry about. okay?

1069
01:13:04.262 --> 01:13:06.845
I've seen it a couple of times.

1070
01:13:07.861 --> 01:13:11.684
and your performance was outstanding.

1071
01:13:11.684 --> 01:13:12.934
Listen. this...

1072
01:13:15.376 --> 01:13:20.209
This can be like really. really
big for your career. okay?

1073
01:13:21.845 --> 01:13:23.918
- Jay. don't BS me!

1074
01:13:23.918 --> 01:13:24.751
- Shh!

1075
01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:26.602
- Sorry.

1076
01:13:28.893 --> 01:13:30.560
How did this happen?

1077
01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:32.241
- Okay.

1078
01:13:35.507 --> 01:13:37.507
Your ex-boyfriend. yeah.

1079
01:13:38.688 --> 01:13:40.771
he. uh. he got "careless"

1080
01:13:42.969 --> 01:13:45.688
and he lost his laptop.

1081
01:13:45.688 --> 01:13:47.688
and then SinAmerica.com.

1082
01:13:49.346 --> 01:13:51.929
they got a hold of the footage.

1083
01:13:54.095 --> 01:13:57.096
Your boyfriend. he signed off on it.

1084
01:13:57.096 --> 01:13:59.596
and so now. it's. it's on you.

1085
01:14:03.854 --> 01:14:06.366
- And what if I don't?

1086
01:14:06.366 --> 01:14:07.199
- Look.

1087
01:14:08.105 --> 01:14:09.969
I've tried to protect you.

1088
01:14:09.969 --> 01:14:12.969
I've used every connection I've got.

1089
01:14:14.529 --> 01:14:18.446
But eventually. it's.
it's gonna get out there.

1090
01:14:19.941 --> 01:14:24.858
No. listen. We might as well
make some money on this. okay?

1091
01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:49.156
(muffled hip-hop music)

1092
01:14:49.156 --> 01:14:51.989
- [Friend] Tyrese! What's up. man?

1093
01:14:55.287 --> 01:14:57.447

1154
01:18:06.897 --> 01:18:09.814
Yuliya. stop playing games with me.

1155
01:18:15.167 --> 01:18:17.167
Well. where are they at?

1156
01:18:27.798 --> 01:18:28.715
Yeah. okay.

1157
01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.166
I need to go.

1158
01:18:36.166 --> 01:18:37.719

can hear me. but it's Ragan.

1165
01:19:18.058 --> 01:19:21.215
I'm sorry for what I said. okay?

1166
01:19:21.215 --> 01:19:22.632
I didn't mean it.

1167
01:19:26.805 --> 01:19:29.186
Even though sometimes you say things

1168
01:19:29.186 --> 01:19:31.853
that make me wanna strangle you.

1169
01:19:34.249 --> 01:19:38.332
I'd rather fight with you
than see you like this.

1170
01:19:45.663 --> 01:19:50.662
You have to get better so we
can go back to fighting. okay?

1171
01:19:50.662 --> 01:19:52.912
(sniffles)

1172
01:19:53.881 --> 01:19:56.583
I still owe you one for

1173
01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:59.833
putting that salt in my coffee. Winnie.

1174
01:20:30.355 --> 01:20:31.522
You look nice.

1175
01:20:33.294 --> 01:20:35.584
(Tyrese chuckles)

1176
01:20:35.584 --> 01:20:37.334
- How was work today?

1177
01:20:38.945 --> 01:20:41.028
- I quit today. actually.

1178
01:20:42.836 --> 01:20:43.669
- You did?

1179
01:20:46.585 --> 01:20:50.075
I've been lookin' for a job
and you just quit yours?

1180
01:20:50.075 --> 01:20:51.725
- Yeah.

1181
01:20:51.725 --> 01:20:53.162
Yeah. I did.

1182
01:20:53.162 --> 01:20:53.995
- Mm-mm.

1183
01:20:55.356 --> 01:20:58.563
Well. now you can finally
go into advertising.

1184
01:20:58.563 --> 01:20:59.813
- I don't know.

1185
01:21:01.045 --> 01:21:04.962
We don't always get to
do what we want in life.

1186
01:21:06.315 --> 01:21:07.148
- Hm.

1187
01:21:10.273 --> 01:21:13.876
Well. I think you're smart
enough to go into advertising.

1188
01:21:13.876 --> 01:21:16.554
But I respect you. either way.

1189
01:21:16.554 --> 01:21:17.971
- Thanks. Tyrese.

1190
01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:32.842
(sighs)

1191
01:21:32.842 --> 01:21:35.220
- Should we go and talk to them?

1192
01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:36.053
- Yeah.

1193
01:21:48.548 --> 01:21:49.381
Hello.

1194
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:52.462
- Hello.

1195
01:21:54.230 --> 01:21:58.386
I'm so sorry. but I can't
remember your names.

1196
01:21:58.386 --> 01:21:59.386
- I'm Ragan.

1197
01:22:00.423 --> 01:22:01.256
- Tyrese.

1198
01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:03.876
- [Winston] Hi.

1199
01:22:04.856 --> 01:22:09.298
- [Ragan] I'm so sorry.
What happened to your son.

1200
01:22:09.298 --> 01:22:10.605
- Thank you.

1201
01:22:10.605 --> 01:22:12.438
- [Winston] Thank you.

1202
01:22:13.327 --> 01:22:15.244
- If you wouldn't mind.

1203
01:22:16.157 --> 01:22:19.240
I would really love to pray with you.

1204
01:22:20.314 --> 01:22:21.814
for him right now.

1205
01:22:37.158 --> 01:22:41.572
Father God. we come to
you in the name of Jesus

1206
01:22:41.572 --> 01:22:42.905
to pray for Vin.

1207
01:22:54.846 --> 01:22:59.846

(switch clicks)

1212
01:25:14.006 --> 01:25:16.368
- Tell us how you got started.

1213
01:25:16.368 --> 01:25:19.828
- Well. I had $500. so
I bought a computer.

1214
01:25:19.828 --> 01:25:22.829
then I taught myself graphic design.

1215
01:25:22.829 --> 01:25:24.820
- Well. you've landed a lot of big deals

1216
01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:26.530
for your first year in business.

1217
01:25:26.530 --> 01:25:28.698
Tell me. how do you think
you were able to accomplish

1218
01:25:28.698 --> 01:25:30.615
so much with just $500?

1219
01:25:32.057 --> 01:25:33.989
- You know. sometimes the
hardest thing to do in life

1220
01:25:33.989 --> 01:25:36.059
is believe in yourself.

1221
01:25:36.059 --> 01:25:37.611
You gotta have a great team behind you

1222
01:25:37.611 --> 01:25:40.700
willing to help you achieve your vision.

1223
01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:44.371
- Daddy!
(Tyrese laughs)

1224
01:25:44.371 --> 01:25:45.431
- How you doin'?

1225
01:25:45.431 --> 01:25:47.309
- Good.
- You good?

1226
01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:49.488
All right. you ready to go be great?

1227
01:25:49.488 --> 01:25:50.738
Yeah. let's go.

1228
01:26:16.933 --> 01:26:17.933
- [Vin] Hey.

1229
01:26:19.522 --> 01:26:20.503
- [Ragan] Hey.

1230
01:26:20.503 --> 01:26:22.269
- I'm so glad you could make it.

1231
01:26:22.269 --> 01:26:26.104
- You know I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

1232
01:26:26.104 --> 01:26:27.974
- Hey. princess!
(Ragan gasps)

1233
01:26:27.974 --> 01:26:29.043
How are you?

1234
01:26:29.043 --> 01:26:30.024
- Good.
- Good!

1235
01:26:30.024 --> 01:26:32.644
You're getting so big!

1236
01:26:32.644 --> 01:26:33.936
What's up. man?

1237
01:26:33.936 --> 01:26:36.075
- Hey.
- Hey. sweetheart.

1238
01:26:36.075 --> 01:26:39.438
- Hey. we saw the news piece. Good stuff.

1239
01:26:39.438 --> 01:26:41.147
- Yeah. we make a pretty good team.

1240
01:26:41.147 --> 01:26:42.480
- Yep. The best.
