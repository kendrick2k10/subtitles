(CHIRPING)

4
00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:02.604
AGNES: Once upon a time.

5
00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:06.567
there was a magical place
called the Motherland.

6
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:10.279
where Fairy Godmothers lived and learned

7
00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:13.156
all they needed to know
about godmothering.

8
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.908
Oh. blah. blah. blah.

9
00:01:14.992 --> 00:01:17.160
We all know how this bit goes.

10
00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.371
This is not your usual fairy tale.

11
00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:22.708
Fairy tales end with "happily ever after."

12
00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.835
and that's where we begin.

13
00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:29.256
AGNES: Good morning. Motherland!

14
00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.844
It's almost the weekend.
and you know what that means.

15
00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:40.017
Grab a pumpkin. raise your wands.
break out the glass slippers.

16
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.812
it's time to party like it's 1699.

17
00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:47.774
I'm gonna kick things off
with everyone's favorite pop hit.

(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

19
00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:59.286
I'm Agnes. I'm 172 years old at least.

20
00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.747
And I'm too cool for school.

21
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.835
It's why they made me the resident DJ.
and I don't have to go to lessons.

22
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:10.255
But this isn't about me.

23
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.549
This is the story of Eleanor.

24
00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:16.178
She's the Motherland's youngest trainee

25
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:20.182
and the only person
who's bothered to apply in decades.

26
00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.685
All she wanted was to graduate.

27
00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.771
to be a real Fairy Godmother.

28
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:29.274
to have her name in a book
alongside the greats.

29
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.903
That's her in the pink. without any pals.

This is Moira. the headmistress.

33
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.832
She wrote the book
on Fairy Godmothering. literally.

34
00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:48.418
Let us open our texts. shall we?

35
00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:54.174
AGNES: She's been banging on
about the same old formula for centuries.

36
00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:56.844
Yesterday. we reviewed step one.

37
00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:59.096
AGNES: Oh. you didn't know
there was a formula?

38
00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.556
Recite it with me. please.

39
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:05.853
ALL: A glittery gown
turns a frown upside down.

40
00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:16.947
Ooh! Oh. wow!

41
00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.826
-Ooh!
-It's just the same.

42
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.955
Once you've conjured the gown.
you're on your way to step two.

43
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:28.750
-Which is?
-ALL: Find their true love.

44
00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:30.377
Correct.

45
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.589
Now. once the gown and true love
are in place.

46
00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.383
we move on to step three.

47
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.843
Which is?

-ELEANOR: Oh. please?
-Anyone?

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:42.014
-Anybody?
-Oh. I know it.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:43.807
-You?
-My arm's tired.

00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:45.392
-MOIRA: Anyone else?
-Hurts to hold it up.

52
00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:46.476
Literally anyone.

53
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.896

-Yes.

-Can we do something different today?
-(GASPS)

58
00:03:59.907 --> 00:04:04.161

62
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.752
AGNES: And this is where
the problems really started.

63
00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:15.422
because Moira is not
someone you want to cross.

64
00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:19.843
Step three is happily ever after.

65
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:23.555
-It just happens.
-Yes. it just happens.

66
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.557
It's step three.

I can be your study buddy.

MOIRA: There's no reason to be confused.

70
00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:39.988
The formula has been the cornerstone
of Fairy Godmothering since it began

71
00:04:40.072 --> 00:04:42.824
because it works.

72
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:44.535
If it works.

73
00:04:44.952 --> 00:04:47.371

falling apart?

Well. everyone except Eleanor. that is.

77
00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:00.843
And she's never gonna be
a Fairy Godmother.

78
00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:02.594

So when exactly were you going to
fess up to her and us

83
00:05:18.277 --> 00:05:20.863
that you are about to
shut this school down.

84
00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:24.074

(GASPS) What?

87
00:05:27.703 --> 00:05:30.289
AGNES: And this was the moment
that Eleanor realized

88
00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:35.043
she would never be a Fairy Godmother
unless she found an assignment.

89
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:40.549
Now. being a Tooth Fairy
didn't sound so bad to me.

You only work nights.

91
00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.678
you've always got
a little change in your pocket.

92

But Eleanor. she was
not about to give up her dream.

93
00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:52.728
All she needed was one assignment.

94
00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:56.940

That's why they're shutting us down.

So. now Mr. Clancy wants me to
sing Kim's solo at the parade next week.

517
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:50.981
What parade?

518
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.317
The big holiday parade downtown.

519
00:28:53.567 --> 00:28:55.569
Did you tell him you don't wanna do it?

520
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:59.656
Yeah. I'm going to. It's a dumb idea.

521
00:29:00.699 --> 00:29:04.161
Uh... Look. it's not a dumb idea.

522
00:29:04.244 --> 00:29:06.538
It's just... They'd be lucky to have you.

523
00:29:06.622 --> 00:29:08.498
There's a reason
you didn't join show choir.

524
00:29:08.582 --> 00:29:10.959
Yeah. I know. It's fine.
Forget it. I'm going to bed.

I bet when Beyoncé was young.

529
00:29:19.551 --> 00:29:22.221
her mother used to encourage her
in exactly the same way.

530
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.854
Did Beyoncé hyperventilate so badly
in her eighth-grade talent show

531
00:29:30.938 --> 00:29:32.981
that she passed out and cracked a rib?

532
00:29:33.065 --> 00:29:34.525
In seventh grade. it was hives.

533
00:29:34.608 --> 00:29:37.027
She scratched those scabs
so badly they got infected.

534
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.238
I had to take her
to the hospital at 2:00 a.m.

535
00:29:39.321 --> 00:29:41.865
She had a fever of 103.
Doctor said she could have got sepsis.

536
00:29:41.949 --> 00:29:44.076
If you ever get sick of your job
as a TV producer.

537
00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:45.994
you could become a motivational speaker.

538
00:29:46.078 --> 00:29:48.497
Sixth grade. she projectile vomited
before she got onstage.

539
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.291
Every time she goes to perform.
it's a complete disaster.

540
00:29:51.375 --> 00:29:53.168
She ends up totally crushed.

541
00:29:53.252 --> 00:29:54.378
You sound like Mom.

542
00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:56.046
Well. Mom has common sense.

543
00:29:56.839 --> 00:29:58.423
Mom didn't raise Beyoncé.

544
00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:18.235

Oh.

00:30:28.203 --> 00:30:30.664
-Is this your true love?
-Not anymore.

that you find your true love

550
00:30:35.836 --> 00:30:37.462

551
00:30:38.213 --> 00:30:39.965

isn't always a fairy tale.

553

Sometimes people grow
or change or get divorced

554
00:30:47.848 --> 00:30:50.100
or fall out of love
or run off and join a cult

555
00:30:50.184 --> 00:30:52.811
or fall in love
with a skinny Pilates instructor.

556

as "happily ever after."

But it has to be.

558

I came all this way to help you
find your heart's desire.

559
00:31:00.736 --> 00:31:03.113
My heart's desire now
would be a clean house

560
00:31:03.197 --> 00:31:07.326
and maybe the eyebrows that I had
before I started stress plucking.

561
00:31:09.203 --> 00:31:11.371

Do you want me to make your bed?

No. I already did it.

690

is literally my job.

-What do you do?

their happily ever after.

-You must be from California.
-Hmm.

694
00:38:14.002 --> 00:38:17.631

the organization's effort to recycle.

We could do that.

in a storm drain. drinking sewer water

698

and eating roadkill to survive.

699
00:38:25.639 --> 00:38:27.140

00:38:27.224 --> 00:38:29.393
There are some guys
having an eating contest.

701
00:38:29.476 --> 00:38:32.604
shoving chili dogs down their masks.
which can be pretty gross.

702
00:38:32.688 --> 00:38:34.606
Yeah. and if we get lucky
and someone chokes.

703
00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.567
we could even do a story on killer chili.

704
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:37.985
We could only dream.

705
00:38:38.068 --> 00:38:41.071

for people eating undercooked wings.

no fireworks were planned

765

the event may be caused
by an unusual weather phenomenon.

that you and your cousin

to pull that off. I actually believe you.

Plus. your cousin seems crazy.
She is. right?

1459

No! No. she's just a little different.

1696
01:36:31.875 --> 01:36:34.044
I am a Fairy Godmother.

1697
01:36:34.127 --> 01:36:37.464
And what Fairy Godmothers
are supposed to do is help.

1698

I did. I helped Jane.

Jane was not the assignment.

And even if she were.
there are no more assignments.

1701

Mackenzie was the last one.

1702
01:36:54.606 --> 01:36:57.734
And I do not see a dress or a prince.

1703
01:36:58.193 --> 01:37:01.363
And you did not get her
to happily ever after.

-You did not save the Motherland.

You helped me remember
how to live happily.

Then how it works needs to change.

1724

We think that love
needs to look a certain way.
