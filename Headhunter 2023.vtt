3
00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:49.375
I challenge you. one on one!

4
00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:52.000
No swordsman fears a challenge!

5
00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:54.708
The winner gets the opponent's head!

6
00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:29.167
Empiang…

7
00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:33.708
Where are the kids?

8
00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:38.667
They were playing outside just now.

9
00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:41.792
Anang!

10
00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:43.583
Lebor!

11
00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:53.375
Come with me.

12
00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:55.250
Where are we going? To the ring?

13
00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:58.625
Go pack your food. We'll be there all day.

14
00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.875
Time flies. Our kids are grown-ups.

15
00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:08.708
They're bigger

16
00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:10.833
and naughtier.

17
00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.625
Lebor likes to provoke everybody.

18
00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:14.708
Yesterday.

19
00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:18.708
Lebor hit the bead basket.

20
00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.833
Everything fell on the ground.

21
00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:23.375
He didn't even help me clean it up

22
00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:25.000
and just ran away.

23
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
That's normal. They're boys.

24
00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:29.500
Yes.

25
00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:33.042
Don't pamper him too much.
or he'll become a spoiled brat.

26
00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:37.083
We're ready. Dad.

27
00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:44.000
Let's go. We're leaving now.

28
00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:57.833
Step forward
when the enemy attacks from the front.

29
00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:59.125
Be ahead of them.

30
00:04:59.792 --> 00:05:01.708
-You two keep practicing.
-Okay.

31
00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:05.500
I have to go
for something important. Let's go.

32
00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:11.417
I'm so tired. Let's take a break.

33
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.417
Dad told us to keep practicing.

34
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.875
That's enough.

35
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.625
Untai. Siah. and Lebor.

36
00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:29.458
I want to show you something.

37
00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:31.333
What is it?

38
00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:33.625
What if Dad gets angry?

39
00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:35.167
It won't take too long.

40
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.958
Dad is away now.

41
00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:38.792
Let's go.

42
00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:42.917
Come on. you two.

43
00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:44.375
Okay.

44
00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:02.083
Here. look!

45
00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.333
Wow!

46
00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:05.833
This place is beautiful.

47
00:06:06.292 --> 00:06:10.000
This place is beautiful.
Anang. I think heaven looks like this.

48
00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:13.167
Yes. this is our spot.

49
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.542
This is our heaven.

50
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.792
Come on. as if you've seen heaven before.

51
00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:20.542
When'd you find this?

52
00:06:20.917 --> 00:06:22.792
That time I went to the forest with Dad.

53
00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:24.125
I told you before.

54
00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:27.625
You'll fall in love with this place.

55
00:06:27.917 --> 00:06:31.750
I can't believe there's a beautiful place
like this near our home.

56
00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:34.417
Wow! It's so high.

57
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.583
Untai. look there!

58
00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:37.458
Let's dive in!

59
00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:39.250
Dive in?

60
00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:41.125
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

61
00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:44.125
We're the children of Iban heroes!
Nothing scares us!

62
00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:45.583
Let's dive together!

63
00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:48.792
Lebor. let's make a pledge.

64
00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:51.833
We vow that we'll not part.

65
00:06:52.792 --> 00:06:54.833
will help each other.

66
00:06:55.292 --> 00:06:57.375
and will love each other till death.

67
00:06:58.708 --> 00:06:59.833
One. two. three.

68
00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:02.750
We vow that we will not part.

69
00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:05.625
will help each other.

70
00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:09.625
and will love each other till we die.

71
00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:40.250
Aunty. Anang and Lebor aren't there
at the training ring.

72
00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:41.667
They aren't there?

73
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.500
Where did Anang go?

74
00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:46.667
Lebor? Untai? Siah?

75
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.625
-Did you see them?
-Nobody's there. Aunty.

76
00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:52.167
This must be Lebor's idea!

77
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.083
-Go and find them!
-Okay. Aunty.

78
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.417
-Where is Anang?
-Lebor. go find Anang.

79
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.292
Where did he go?
What's taking him so long?

80
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.458
What if something happened to Anang?

81
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.750
Come on. don't worry. He'll be safe.

82
00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:28.250
Didn't we promise to help each other?

83
00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:31.333
Hence I'm here.
I don't want to leave you here.

84
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.167
Also. you two are girls.

85
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.417
I'm not afraid!

86
00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:39.000
Lebor. that's Anang.

87
00:08:40.792 --> 00:08:42.292
Where'd you go. Anang?

88
00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:45.333
Here you go.

89
00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:48.458
What's this?

90
00:08:48.917 --> 00:08:50.042
The liver of a warbler.

91
00:08:50.917 --> 00:08:52.542
That's for you. Take it.

92
00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:55.500
This liver of a warbler is

93
00:08:55.583 --> 00:08:58.917
to show my love for you!

94
00:08:59.292 --> 00:09:01.333
Please know I'll always love you.

95
00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:02.958
Don't worry about my passing.

96
00:09:03.833 --> 00:09:06.667
I'll make sure I won't die
as long as you're alive.

97
00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:09.208
We are like a pair of warblers.

98
00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:13.083
We'll not be able to live
if one of us is gone.

99
00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:20.708
Anang. listen to the drum.
The enemy's here!

100
00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:22.333
Let's go home!

101
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.292
Uncle. I've looked everywhere.
but I still haven't found them.

102
00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:28.667
Is that so?

103
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.167
Were you really looking?

104
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.750
Oh my God!

105
00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:34.083
Where'd the boys go?

106
00:09:34.958 --> 00:09:36.417
Jago isn't home either!

107
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.958
I've been looking for them everywhere.

108
00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:40.375
I couldn't find them.

109
00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:49.042
Mom. I hunted down a warbler.

110
00:09:49.125 --> 00:09:52.542
I gave the liver to Untai
as a sign of my love for her.

111
00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:54.125
You went into the forest?

112
00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:00.958
I was worried sick!

113
00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:03.292
You made me worry!

114
00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:09.583
Take this! And this!

115
00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:14.167
This is a lesson for them!

116
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.500
Do you want to kill them?

117
00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:17.458
Jago. what happened?

118
00:10:17.875 --> 00:10:21.250
I fell into the ravine.

119
00:10:21.333 --> 00:10:23.000
Honey. are you okay?

120
00:10:41.917 --> 00:10:43.125
Ouch. that hurts.

121
00:10:43.708 --> 00:10:46.250
-Son.
-Yes. Dad.

122
00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:50.542
Don't feel inferior or distant…

123
00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:54.208
because you are adopted.

124
00:10:55.417 --> 00:10:57.458
We still care for you and love you

125
00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:04.417
like we would if you were our own child.

126
00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:06.792
Please look after Anang

127
00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:10.083
and Mom too.

128
00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.208
When I'm gone.

129
00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:16.833
I hope you'll take my place.

130
00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:19.667
Please don't say that.

131
00:11:20.417 --> 00:11:21.917
Promise me. Lebor?

132
00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:25.500
Yes. I promise to look after Mom

133
00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:30.125
and Anang until my last breath.

134
00:11:52.417 --> 00:11:54.375
Don't let anger get the better of you.

135
00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:57.042
Don't simply hit the children.

136
00:11:57.125 --> 00:11:58.667
They deserved to be beaten.

137
00:11:59.417 --> 00:12:01.667
They wandered all day.
Everyone looked for them.

138
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.292
I didn't know where they'd got go!

139
00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:06.458
Why didn't you ask them first?

140
00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:08.708
Ask where they went.

141
00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:13.208
What if they'd had a problem?
Maybe something happened to them?

142
00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:15.292
I was furious and distraught.

143
00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:17.542
What if something bad had happened?

144
00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:21.167
As parents. we must worry about them.

145
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.417
or else they'll cause trouble.

146
00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:26.792
But we must also prevent ourselves
from being too extreme.

147
00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:30.083
This is because of Lebor.

148
00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:32.417
He's ungrateful.

149
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.542
He should be taking care of Anang.

150
00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:40.167
but he taught him to be naughty.

151
00:12:58.667 --> 00:12:59.917
Oh my God.

152
00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:02.125
Whose son is this?

153
00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:17.000
Please don't say that.

154
00:13:18.583 --> 00:13:20.417
Their future is far-off.

155
00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:24.125
Don't say that because of this.

156
00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:26.792
Don't say that to Lebor.

157
00:13:26.875 --> 00:13:28.167
How could you?!

158
00:13:29.167 --> 00:13:30.958
I love Anang so much.

159
00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:32.875
He is my son.

160
00:13:33.958 --> 00:13:36.083
I don't want anything bad
to happen to him.

161
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.375
Ouch. that hurts.

162
00:13:52.417 --> 00:13:56.667
Lebor. you have a fever
because you were badly beaten yesterday.

163
00:13:57.292 --> 00:13:59.208
Don't simply say that!

164
00:13:59.292 --> 00:14:01.833
She wants to be a shaman
when she grows up.

165
00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:17.458
Anang. Lebor.

166
00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:20.417
Let's go to the ring and practice.

167
00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:24.000
Dad. Lebor is unwell.

168
00:14:26.625 --> 00:14:27.875
His temperature's high.

169
00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:31.417
Empiang. can you give him medicine?

170
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.125
Just rest at home.

171
00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:39.000
You don't have to practice.

172
00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:42.750
Anang. let's go!

173
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Siah. let's go with Anang.

174
00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:50.792
No. you both are girls.
They'll be staying there until dusk!

175
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.458
They'll be home late too.

176
00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:08.208
Once again.

177
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.583
You must be strong to be a warrior.

178
00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:21.792
Don't be soft
or the enemy will defeat you.

179
00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:28.375
It's not easy to be an Iban warrior.

180
00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:30.667
Understood. Dad.

181
00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:33.292
Let's eat.

182
00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:47.792
This potato is so delicious.

183
00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:50.625
It's delicious because your mom made it.

184
00:16:02.167 --> 00:16:03.792
Look at this.

185
00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:07.958
Do you know the history of this machete?

186
00:16:09.125 --> 00:16:12.875
The dots are the number of heads
beheaded by this machete.

187
00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:25.792
Let's go back!

188
00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:36.583
I've been waiting so long for this moment!

189
00:16:39.292 --> 00:16:42.125
I have come to avenge
the death of my brother. Likas.

190
00:16:42.708 --> 00:16:44.375
whom you killed.

191
00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.708
Now. it is your turn. Jago!

192
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.333
Jago!

193
00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:32.208
Dad!

194
00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:50.083
Don't be afraid of death. son!

195
00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:53.000
Iban warriors aren't afraid to die.

196
00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:56.458
A true Iban warrior
isn't one who beheads others.

197
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.042
but one who's willing
to sacrifice himself.

198
00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:01.042
Damn you!

199
00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.417
Dad!

200
00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:45.333
Enough with the practice.

201
00:18:49.625 --> 00:18:50.625
Have a break.

202
00:18:51.542 --> 00:18:52.542
Let's eat first.

203
00:19:00.458 --> 00:19:01.458
Lebor.

204
00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:08.375
This is for you.

205
00:19:08.458 --> 00:19:10.250
It's so delicious.

206
00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:12.500
You should know

207
00:19:12.583 --> 00:19:15.292
that in this longhouse.

208
00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:17.625
Untai's the best cook.

209
00:19:18.417 --> 00:19:19.792
It's late. We must go now.

210
00:19:21.917 --> 00:19:26.333
Wait for a while. We just started eating.

211
00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:32.375
Okay. I'll wait. but be faster.

212
00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:36.667
You really are something.

213
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.208
We waited but you didn't care.

214
00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:40.125
Now we're late.

215
00:19:41.583 --> 00:19:42.750
Let him be.

216
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.833
He wants her attention.

217
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.292
They're lovebirds.

218
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.417
I'm sorry. Anang.

219
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.958
I can't wait any longer.

220
00:20:06.042 --> 00:20:07.583
I'll get scolded later.

221
00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:12.875
Okay.

222
00:20:22.708 --> 00:20:25.500
You're left with me.

223
00:20:26.167 --> 00:20:27.792
I need love too.

224
00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.250
What's bothering you?

225
00:20:44.292 --> 00:20:47.208
What are you thinking about?

226
00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:51.583
I remembered

227
00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:58.458
how Sapik cruelly beheaded our father…

228
00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:01.625
before my very eyes.

229
00:21:05.292 --> 00:21:06.458
Lebor.

230
00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:09.958
I swear…

231
00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:17.250
if I ever run into him.

232
00:21:19.083 --> 00:21:20.417
I'll behead him!

233
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.958
What's this?

234
00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:49.750
Anang. this trap is dangerous.

235
00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:53.208
Stop making the trap.

236
00:21:54.417 --> 00:21:55.958
If somebody falls in. they'll die!

237
00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:00.250
Indeed. I want people dead!

238
00:22:00.333 --> 00:22:03.167
I want Sapik to fall in here.
It would serve him right.

239
00:22:04.458 --> 00:22:06.625
Let him die!

240
00:22:08.708 --> 00:22:13.167
This is the route
that Sapik and his people took

241
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.875
when he killed Dad.

242
00:22:18.833 --> 00:22:20.083
If he takes this route.

243
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.333
it's his funeral.

244
00:22:38.542 --> 00:22:42.083
What are you thinking right now?

245
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.500
Here.

246
00:22:49.667 --> 00:22:51.042
The liver of a warbler.

247
00:22:59.542 --> 00:23:00.750
I'm thinking of you.

248
00:23:01.917 --> 00:23:03.417
You care too much about me.

249
00:23:03.833 --> 00:23:05.583
My life has no purpose without you.

250
00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:09.333
You mean the world to me.

251
00:23:09.417 --> 00:23:10.917
You get me?

252
00:23:11.917 --> 00:23:13.042
Here. take this.

253
00:23:17.708 --> 00:23:18.833
Pua kumbu.

254
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.917
I weaved this pua kumbu myself.

255
00:23:26.292 --> 00:23:27.292
Wow!

256
00:23:28.833 --> 00:23:30.917
It's beautiful.

257
00:23:32.208 --> 00:23:34.667
I'm happy to see your sweet smile.

258
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.417
What are you doing here?

259
00:24:00.125 --> 00:24:01.125
Bird watching.

260
00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:05.708
If you want to hunt birds.
where's your blowgun?

261
00:24:11.458 --> 00:24:13.167
I know what you were doing.

262
00:24:15.875 --> 00:24:18.875
If we like someone.

263
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:26.125
does that person like us too?

264
00:24:28.792 --> 00:24:31.125
Do you want to be like them?

265
00:24:45.208 --> 00:24:48.875
Armed with high spirit

266
00:24:50.667 --> 00:24:55.042
For the fighters

267
00:24:55.125 --> 00:25:00.833
Who went to war

268
00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:10.292
The courage to behead the enemy

269
00:25:11.042 --> 00:25:16.417
To bring home

270
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:23.458
To the longhouse

271
00:25:25.125 --> 00:25:28.750
Will be greeted with a tilt ceremony

272
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.375
The man with the rivet
Also came and went home

273
00:25:34.458 --> 00:25:41.458
Will forever care for you in the war

274
00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:55.875
The winner of the title of best weaver

275
00:25:57.417 --> 00:25:58.750
goes to Untai!

276
00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:04.792
With that.

277
00:26:05.125 --> 00:26:08.917
the Indu Takar Award is awarded to Untai.

278
00:26:13.875 --> 00:26:16.083
Please. take this.

279
00:26:23.792 --> 00:26:25.792
Way to go!

280
00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:35.458
Anang. Lebor.

281
00:26:35.542 --> 00:26:36.542
-Yes?
-Yes?

282
00:26:38.708 --> 00:26:44.250
Guess who just won the Indu Takar Award?

283
00:26:46.958 --> 00:26:48.833
Untai!

284
00:26:48.917 --> 00:26:51.000
Wow!

285
00:26:51.375 --> 00:26:53.292
Congratulations. Untai!

286
00:26:54.208 --> 00:26:55.583
I knew you'd win!

287
00:26:57.708 --> 00:27:00.542
No other girls can top you. right?

288
00:27:00.625 --> 00:27:07.250
Congratulations on winning
the Indu Takar Award!

289
00:27:08.125 --> 00:27:12.708
I'm gifting a jungle fowl
in celebration of your success!

290
00:27:14.792 --> 00:27:15.792
-Siah.
-Yes?

291
00:27:17.167 --> 00:27:19.875
This is for you.

292
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.333
Except I'm…

293
00:27:22.417 --> 00:27:23.958
You also won today.

294
00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:28.792
-That's right. Siah!
-What?

295
00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:34.792
We all won today.

296
00:27:35.125 --> 00:27:40.167
Thank you. You are always so nice to me.

297
00:27:41.333 --> 00:27:43.250
Of course! Did you forget our pledge?

298
00:27:44.292 --> 00:27:45.708
What are you going to cook?

299
00:27:46.417 --> 00:27:48.667
I'm hungry already.

300
00:27:50.125 --> 00:27:52.625
You want to eat this? You weren't sincere.

301
00:27:55.833 --> 00:27:59.542
Let's go home. I'm hungry too.

302
00:28:03.958 --> 00:28:10.208
I've seen it all.
I want to test your courage.

303
00:28:12.042 --> 00:28:15.042
Now is the time to prove your greatness.

304
00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:17.292
Find and defeat the enemy.

305
00:28:17.375 --> 00:28:19.667
That signifies you're a warrior.

306
00:28:20.542 --> 00:28:26.875
Whoever among you manages to beat
and behead the enemy

307
00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:31.792
and bring home
an enemy's head to the longhouse

308
00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:35.083
will be granted the title
of Brave Warrior.

309
00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:53.625
All Iban men go through this.

310
00:28:56.875 --> 00:28:58.208
Don't worry about me.

311
00:29:01.542 --> 00:29:02.583
I'm afraid…

312
00:29:04.417 --> 00:29:06.708
that something bad might happen to you.

313
00:29:08.875 --> 00:29:11.833
I'm sure nothing bad is going to happen.

314
00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:14.542
I learned a lot from my dad.

315
00:29:14.625 --> 00:29:17.708
I will come home safely

316
00:29:17.792 --> 00:29:20.208
as a Brave Warrior.

317
00:29:21.042 --> 00:29:22.917
You don't have to be that.

318
00:29:25.583 --> 00:29:27.375
You're enough for me

319
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.208
as you are.

320
00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:34.208
Anang. I…

321
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.125
I'll always be your Anang.

322
00:29:39.875 --> 00:29:42.750
But I also need to be an Iban warrior

323
00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:49.708
because I am the son of a Brave Warrior.

324
00:29:52.417 --> 00:29:54.958
Let's go home.

325
00:30:51.875 --> 00:30:56.250
Lebor. promise me
that you'll look after Anang.

326
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.083
Okay. Mom.

327
00:30:59.083 --> 00:31:03.167
We'll look after each other.

328
00:31:03.958 --> 00:31:07.417
Don't worry. Mom. I will not fail.

329
00:31:08.625 --> 00:31:10.333
I'll come home with a victory.

330
00:31:11.167 --> 00:31:13.333
I'll pray for your safety.

331
00:31:13.417 --> 00:31:15.792
so you'll come back in one piece.

332
00:31:20.375 --> 00:31:23.167
I'll always wait

333
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.667
for your return.

334
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.833
Okay.

335
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.958
Wait for my return…

336
00:31:35.458 --> 00:31:36.542
with at least

337
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.708
one enemy's head.

338
00:32:09.708 --> 00:32:14.542
My stomach hurts. Lebor.

339
00:32:15.292 --> 00:32:17.208
I'm going to find a better spot.

340
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.250
-Anang.
-Yes?

341
00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:44.542
-Let's eat these insects.
-Looks delicious.

342
00:33:02.083 --> 00:33:04.417
Where did our people go?

343
00:33:05.167 --> 00:33:06.750
There's no way we're lost.

344
00:33:06.833 --> 00:33:10.250
We've passed here three times already.

345
00:33:16.542 --> 00:33:18.083
How can it be like this?

346
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:33.875
Lebor. look at this cave.

347
00:33:35.208 --> 00:33:36.708
Where are we?

348
00:33:39.542 --> 00:33:40.917
It's midnight.

349
00:33:42.417 --> 00:33:45.375
-Let's spend the night here.
-Okay.

350
00:34:09.708 --> 00:34:12.667
Anang.

351
00:34:13.375 --> 00:34:17.000
Anang. wake up. It's noon already.

352
00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:21.417
Let's get going.

353
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.750
Lebor…

354
00:35:08.458 --> 00:35:09.458
don't move!

355
00:35:24.708 --> 00:35:26.708
Luckily you saw the snake.

356
00:35:31.833 --> 00:35:33.792
Why do you keep the snake's head?

357
00:35:34.208 --> 00:35:35.542
Dad once told me

358
00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.958
to keep my enemy's head.

359
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.667
Lebor. that's the sound
of the enemy's drum.

360
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.333
We've entered enemy territory.

361
00:37:19.542 --> 00:37:20.542
Anang!

362
00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:50.458
Anang!

363
00:37:59.958 --> 00:38:01.250
Grab this!

364
00:38:03.625 --> 00:38:05.292
Behead him!

365
00:38:08.542 --> 00:38:10.167
Dad!

366
00:38:13.042 --> 00:38:14.042
Anang!

367
00:38:15.458 --> 00:38:16.583
Behead him now!

368
00:38:56.917 --> 00:38:57.917
Grab his head.

369
00:39:01.667 --> 00:39:05.083
Tell them you're the one who did it!

370
00:39:16.208 --> 00:39:17.708
You're a Brave Warrior.

371
00:39:38.667 --> 00:39:40.292
Why do you seem so upset?

372
00:39:41.708 --> 00:39:44.208
Are you thinking about Lebor and Anang?

373
00:39:46.042 --> 00:39:47.125
Yes.

374
00:39:48.625 --> 00:39:50.125
I'm thinking about them.

375
00:39:55.458 --> 00:39:56.958
I shouldn't be worried.

376
00:39:58.625 --> 00:40:01.333
I'm sure they'll come home with victory.

377
00:40:03.292 --> 00:40:04.583
You're very lucky.

378
00:40:05.792 --> 00:40:07.542
My fate is bad.

379
00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:14.167
Nobody wants me because I'm not pretty.

380
00:40:14.875 --> 00:40:17.458
Who am I compared to you?

381
00:40:20.375 --> 00:40:22.042
Don't look down on yourself.

382
00:40:22.292 --> 00:40:23.625
You're beautiful too.

383
00:40:25.667 --> 00:40:29.625
Your eyes and lips are beautiful.

384
00:40:30.708 --> 00:40:31.792
Siah.

385
00:40:33.042 --> 00:40:34.750
the rays of your eyes

386
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.958
have so much love.

387
00:40:39.708 --> 00:40:46.083
I'm so lucky to have friends
as good as you.

388
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:59.750
Dad!

389
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.792
Our Brave Warrior is home.
along with the enemy's head.

390
00:41:09.375 --> 00:41:10.500
Empiang. come here.

391
00:41:33.125 --> 00:41:34.875
Son of a Brave Warrior.

392
00:41:43.292 --> 00:41:44.292
Let's go inside.

393
00:42:36.167 --> 00:42:38.417
Stop!

394
00:42:42.458 --> 00:42:47.167
With this opportunity. we all know that

395
00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:52.042
Lebor and Anang have returned from Ngayau

396
00:42:52.125 --> 00:42:53.542
with the enemy's head.

397
00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:58.833
So both of them

398
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:05.083
proved and fought to be called
Brave Warriors.

399
00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:10.042
So. tomorrow morning.

400
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.292
both of them will be tattooed

401
00:43:14.167 --> 00:43:17.458
as proof that they've managed
to defeat the enemy.

402
00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:23.167
A sign that they are Brave Warriors.

403
00:43:23.583 --> 00:43:24.833
I agree!

404
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.250
Iban!

405
00:43:36.333 --> 00:43:37.333
Let's drink!

406
00:43:45.833 --> 00:43:49.417
Let's continue dancing! Let's drink!

407
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.292
Let's drink!

408
00:44:06.958 --> 00:44:11.792
You fought successfully.
so this tattoo depicts the Brave Warrior.

409
00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:17.000
Both of you deserve to get married.

410
00:44:18.458 --> 00:44:20.500
Do you have someone in mind?

411
00:44:20.583 --> 00:44:21.667
Anang has someone.

412
00:44:34.708 --> 00:44:35.750
Untai…

413
00:44:39.458 --> 00:44:46.042
will you be my wife?

414
00:45:19.208 --> 00:45:21.625
We must conquer the Iban longhouse.

415
00:45:25.167 --> 00:45:26.333
That's the only way

416
00:45:27.833 --> 00:45:29.542
for us to save our people

417
00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:31.625
from hunger and poverty.

418
00:45:41.917 --> 00:45:44.583
I agree. Chief.

419
00:45:45.583 --> 00:45:47.958
Now. our plants seem unsuccessful.

420
00:45:48.792 --> 00:45:52.292
Many animals are dead
because of the epidemic.

421
00:45:53.708 --> 00:45:55.500
By conquering the longhouse.

422
00:45:56.583 --> 00:45:58.708
we can seize everything.

423
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.417
Only then will our lives be comfortable.

424
00:46:03.375 --> 00:46:04.917
The wealth.

425
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.208
land.

426
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:08.500
and girls.

427
00:46:09.458 --> 00:46:12.208
Their daughters will be ours.

428
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.208
How can you defeat those longhouse people

429
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
when there are many warriors
in that house?

430
00:46:24.083 --> 00:46:25.167
Useless!

431
00:46:26.958 --> 00:46:29.917
You're scared.
and that's conceding defeat!

432
00:46:37.042 --> 00:46:38.583
In this forest.

433
00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.125
I'm the king.

434
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:48.750
and I can have whatever I want.

435
00:46:49.917 --> 00:46:54.875
Chief. I have a way
to achieve your desire easily.

436
00:46:55.333 --> 00:46:58.583
We should ask for help
from the pirates' captain. Anton.

437
00:46:58.667 --> 00:47:00.042
Let's drink!

438
00:47:02.875 --> 00:47:03.875
Where's my drink?

439
00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:16.292
I hereby announce to all of you

440
00:47:17.542 --> 00:47:21.875
that Anang will be proposing to Untai.

441
00:47:26.042 --> 00:47:29.625
As usual. we must follow
our customs and culture

442
00:47:30.542 --> 00:47:34.333
to determine Anang's masculinity.

443
00:47:35.333 --> 00:47:37.250
He must climb this pole.

444
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.208
If you fail to climb the pole.
you can't marry Untai.

445
00:47:54.333 --> 00:47:55.500
Climb!

446
00:48:02.125 --> 00:48:03.500
Climb!

447
00:48:03.583 --> 00:48:04.583
Come on.

448
00:48:07.042 --> 00:48:08.708
-Come on!
-Climb it!

449
00:48:09.083 --> 00:48:12.792
Honey. I'm coming! Wait for me!

450
00:48:17.792 --> 00:48:19.125
That's it!

451
00:48:20.542 --> 00:48:21.542
More!

452
00:48:26.625 --> 00:48:28.333
Do you want to get married?

453
00:48:28.708 --> 00:48:30.625
Come on. Anang!

454
00:48:32.833 --> 00:48:34.333
Anang!

455
00:48:43.333 --> 00:48:45.875
You got this!

456
00:48:45.958 --> 00:48:50.708
Anang!

457
00:48:53.792 --> 00:48:54.792
That's it!

458
00:49:08.042 --> 00:49:11.833
How are you going to marry Untai
if you can't climb the pole?

459
00:49:36.833 --> 00:49:38.375
That's it!

460
00:49:53.083 --> 00:49:55.292
At last. Untai is yours now!

461
00:50:02.458 --> 00:50:04.083
You successfully came to me

462
00:50:05.458 --> 00:50:06.708
for the sake of love.

463
00:50:13.042 --> 00:50:15.500
Even if you're in the sky.

464
00:50:16.583 --> 00:50:18.375
I'll reach for you.

465
00:50:19.708 --> 00:50:20.708
Promise me

466
00:50:21.875 --> 00:50:23.833
the love and affection between us…

467
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:28.167
will stay forever.

468
00:50:30.083 --> 00:50:35.458
I promise to love you till death.

469
00:50:40.083 --> 00:50:46.458
I promise. till death do us part.

470
00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:17.667
I want to meet your boss. Anton.

471
00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:29.250
-Apai.
-Yes?

472
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.125
We saw Sapik
with the pirates' captain on the beach.

473
00:51:41.708 --> 00:51:42.750
I second that.

474
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.208
Yes. I know Likas.

475
00:51:55.458 --> 00:51:57.667
I'm indebted to him.

476
00:52:01.833 --> 00:52:03.000
Why do you want to meet me?

477
00:52:06.875 --> 00:52:09.083
Likas was killed by Jago.

478
00:52:11.542 --> 00:52:12.792
I wanted revenge.

479
00:52:14.625 --> 00:52:17.417
I was waiting for the time
to get revenge on him

480
00:52:19.083 --> 00:52:20.958
so I could behead Jago!

481
00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:25.875
The longhouse is not far from the river.

482
00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:29.417
I want to conquer that longhouse!

483
00:52:30.833 --> 00:52:32.208
That's why I came here.

484
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.583
I need your help.

485
00:52:35.625 --> 00:52:36.667
Please help me.

486
00:52:56.250 --> 00:52:59.500
Sapik wants to fight with us again.

487
00:53:01.042 --> 00:53:05.250
He met with the pirates because…

488
00:53:07.875 --> 00:53:09.417
he wanted to ask for help.

489
00:53:11.333 --> 00:53:14.083
He wants to conquer our longhouse.

490
00:53:16.667 --> 00:53:17.708
Dad.

491
00:53:18.208 --> 00:53:22.375
it would be better if all of us

492
00:53:23.708 --> 00:53:25.917
patrolled the beach.

493
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.625
Yes.

494
00:53:29.042 --> 00:53:32.792
The seniors should keep our longhouse
from being conquered by them.

495
00:53:36.542 --> 00:53:38.083
I disagree!

496
00:53:40.458 --> 00:53:43.667
We're experienced warriors.

497
00:53:45.167 --> 00:53:47.208
We should be the ones
patrolling the beach.

498
00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:50.625
Older people like us

499
00:53:51.292 --> 00:53:54.500
have more knowledge
about the ins and outs of fighting.

500
00:53:56.167 --> 00:53:58.833
It's difficult for them
to capture our longhouse.

501
00:54:01.708 --> 00:54:02.708
If so…

502
00:54:05.292 --> 00:54:08.417
senior warriors will patrol the beach.

503
00:54:09.833 --> 00:54:16.042
while the young warriors
patrol the longhouse.

504
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.208
My dad.

505
00:56:24.708 --> 00:56:26.042
Jago!

506
00:56:33.542 --> 00:56:34.708
Anang!

507
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.000
-Untai!
-Anang!

508
00:56:52.792 --> 00:56:54.208
Sapik!

509
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:02.250
Stop!

510
00:57:10.375 --> 00:57:11.500
She's beautiful.

511
00:57:13.708 --> 00:57:15.042
Take good care of her.

512
00:58:09.333 --> 00:58:10.500
She's beautiful.

513
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:13.917
Take good care of this girl.

514
00:58:18.583 --> 00:58:20.667
An eye for an eye!

515
00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:31.375
I'll kill your killer. honey!

516
00:58:39.458 --> 00:58:42.417
I can't live without you.

517
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.083
Sapik!

518
01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.208
Sapik!

519
01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:47.625
Why did you kill Untai?

520
01:00:49.792 --> 01:00:52.250
I'm a warrior.

521
01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:56.000
there's no reason for me to kill a girl.

522
01:00:58.208 --> 01:01:00.292
Jago…

523
01:01:01.708 --> 01:01:04.042
Jago…

524
01:01:05.125 --> 01:01:07.583
Your son is here.

525
01:01:13.458 --> 01:01:14.875
You're here for revenge?

526
01:01:16.333 --> 01:01:18.833
You want to avenge your father's death?

527
01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:20.458
Dad!

528
01:03:30.125 --> 01:03:31.417
This is Sapik's head.

529
01:03:32.583 --> 01:03:33.750
I beheaded him.

530
01:03:36.083 --> 01:03:37.167
I'm happy now!

531
01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:41.458
I have avenged the deaths

532
01:03:43.917 --> 01:03:45.417
of Untai and my dad.

533
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.667
Mom…

534
01:03:50.417 --> 01:03:54.458
-I brought Dad's head home.
-Gosh.

535
01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:08.667
Anang will be the head of the warriors.

536
01:04:15.625 --> 01:04:17.167
Where'd you get the bracelet?

537
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.708
I've something important to tell you.

538
01:05:33.833 --> 01:05:35.667
What do you want to tell me?

539
01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:47.292
It'll hurt you.
but it's wrong to keep this from you.

540
01:05:49.042 --> 01:05:50.833
I'm afraid to tell you.

541
01:05:51.667 --> 01:05:55.000
Remember. an Iban person
shouldn't be afraid!

542
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.458
Lebor. where were you coming from?

543
01:06:12.792 --> 01:06:14.750
You scared me.

544
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:18.083
I want to talk to Untai.

545
01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:24.708
Siah. you should go home.

546
01:06:38.792 --> 01:06:39.833
Untai…

547
01:06:44.833 --> 01:06:47.125
I'm begging you.

548
01:06:48.417 --> 01:06:50.625
Please. don't marry Anang.

549
01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:58.000
What are you talking about?

550
01:06:58.083 --> 01:06:59.125
Are you crazy?

551
01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:03.833
Yes. I'm crazy about you.

552
01:07:07.208 --> 01:07:10.333
I've loved you for a long time.
We should get married.

553
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.250
Lebor!

554
01:07:16.542 --> 01:07:18.083
Lebor!

555
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.333
Don't do this!

556
01:07:22.208 --> 01:07:24.167
Why are you doing this to me?

557
01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:29.833
Is it wrong for me to love you?

558
01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:33.417
Yes. it's wrong!

559
01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:35.958
Lebor!

560
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:55.333
Lebor!

561
01:07:56.708 --> 01:07:57.833
Lebor!

562
01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:02.417
Lebor!

563
01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:05.375
Lebor!

564
01:08:09.208 --> 01:08:11.417
Lebor!

565
01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:30.792
I can't keep this from you.

566
01:08:34.083 --> 01:08:35.458
I'm full of regret.

567
01:08:36.958 --> 01:08:38.542
Where'd you get the bracelet?

568
01:09:11.542 --> 01:09:14.000
Lebor!

569
01:09:22.708 --> 01:09:24.458
Why did you kill my beloved?

570
01:09:27.417 --> 01:09:28.833
Pick up your machete!

571
01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:30.583
What has gotten into you?

572
01:09:33.292 --> 01:09:36.458
One of us will die today!

573
01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:44.792
What's the point of me living
when my beloved is dead?

574
01:09:52.125 --> 01:09:53.958
I didn't kill Untai!

575
01:10:20.833 --> 01:10:21.875
Anang!

576
01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:28.708
Anang!

577
01:10:39.042 --> 01:10:40.042
Anang.

578
01:10:54.708 --> 01:10:55.708
Anang!

579
01:11:13.458 --> 01:11:14.458
Anang!

580
01:11:16.542 --> 01:11:21.167
Why did you kill Untai?

581
01:11:27.708 --> 01:11:34.417
Why did you act so cruelly to our family?

582
01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:36.500
Anang.

583
01:11:38.833 --> 01:11:41.167
My parents

584
01:11:42.667 --> 01:11:46.958
looked after you like their own child.

585
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:53.958
No wonder your own family

586
01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:59.292
left you in the woods.

587
01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:03.708
I didn't kill Untai!

588
01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:08.417
I never betrayed you or Untai.

589
01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:12.875
Untai didn't die because of me.

590
01:12:15.542 --> 01:12:17.000
I swear…

591
01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:23.000
I'll behead the person who did this.

592
01:12:27.625 --> 01:12:30.250
Why did you do this to Anang?

593
01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.167
Anang!

594
01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.583
Anang.

595
01:12:42.708 --> 01:12:45.500
You're the one who should have died!

596
01:12:45.917 --> 01:12:47.083
Not Anang!

597
01:12:48.708 --> 01:12:54.000
You shouldn't die. Anang.

598
01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:03.167
You don't deserve to die. Anang.

599
01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:09.208
I betrayed Untai.

600
01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:17.667
Marry me.

601
01:13:18.667 --> 01:13:20.833
I love you. Anang.

602
01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.042
What do you mean?

603
01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:41.208
Well…

604
01:13:42.583 --> 01:13:44.667
I've lost to Untai since I was young.

605
01:13:46.708 --> 01:13:50.000
Everything she did.
she was always better than me.

606
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:54.792
I had feelings

607
01:13:56.417 --> 01:13:59.583
for Anang since the beginning…

608
01:14:01.667 --> 01:14:04.000
but he never realized it.

609
01:14:07.458 --> 01:14:10.000
Everything was about Untai.

610
01:14:23.958 --> 01:14:27.167
I'm a train wreck.

611
01:14:29.458 --> 01:14:30.625
Lebor…

612
01:14:32.875 --> 01:14:36.958
never liked me because he
had feelings for Untai.

613
01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:43.625
I couldn't bear to see Untai with Anang.

614
01:14:58.667 --> 01:15:00.708
I thought it would be better if she died.

615
01:15:10.208 --> 01:15:12.375
What are you talking about. Siah?

616
01:15:22.125 --> 01:15:24.042
So. you're the one who killed her?

617
01:15:40.333 --> 01:15:41.958
You deserve

618
01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.042
to be beheaded!

619
01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:56.000
Lebor!

620
01:15:57.417 --> 01:15:58.625
Don't do that!

621
01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:02.917
-She's our family too!
-Anang.

622
01:16:07.208 --> 01:16:08.417
I have…

623
01:16:12.417 --> 01:16:16.958
one last request.

624
01:16:23.125 --> 01:16:26.083
Just say it.

625
01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:33.458
Before my last breath…

626
01:16:38.667 --> 01:16:40.583
I hope

627
01:16:41.958 --> 01:16:47.417
you can fulfill my wish.

628
01:16:48.958 --> 01:16:51.500
Please say it.

629
01:16:53.958 --> 01:16:59.958
Dad once told me…

630
01:17:04.792 --> 01:17:09.083
a true Iban warrior…

631
01:17:12.042 --> 01:17:18.792
isn't one who beheads others…

632
01:17:23.542 --> 01:17:25.208
but one who's willing…

633
01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:31.167
to sacrifice himself.

634
01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:35.625
I don't get it.

635
01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:41.958
Behead me.

636
01:17:48.042 --> 01:17:51.208
I want to die…

637
01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:54.792
like my father…

638
01:17:57.167 --> 01:18:01.750
as a true Iban warrior.

639
01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:15.625
Lebor!

640
01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:23.000
Behead me. now!

641
01:18:24.083 --> 01:18:25.208
Behead me!

642
01:18:28.125 --> 01:18:32.417
Don't do it.

643
01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:50.208
Lebor. don't do it!

644
01:18:50.875 --> 01:18:55.125
Anang!

645
01:18:56.583 --> 01:18:57.667
Anang.
