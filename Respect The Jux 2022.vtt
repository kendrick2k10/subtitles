00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:51.717
I want you to kill him.

177
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:55.762
Kill him for what?

178
00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:57.431
For your father.

179
00:09:58.682 --> 00:09:59.975
For my father?

180
00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:01.393
What he did to my father?

181

That pussy informed on your father.
which is why police killed your father.

186
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.369
Remember that. Dead!

187
00:10:21.997 --> 00:10:23.707
[General] Make sure
you shoot him in the head.

188
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.709
[Cat] Now. you have to admit that

189
00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.462
the world is a better place
without some people.

190
00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:32.633
And this asshole Mr. Joiner here
is one of them.

191
00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:35.511
What the bloodclaat you
looking for? You have money?

192
00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:39.139
Hurry up. man. 'cause I don't have
all day to look at your face.

193

Give me one sweetie.

194
00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.355
[Cat] I’m playing cool.

195
00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:50.609
but this fucking idiot boy
is why my father is dead.

196

Pussy.

197
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:06.542
Oye!

198
00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:09.962
Come here.

199
00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:15.884
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

200
00:11:15.968 --> 00:11:16.885
Eat what?

201
00:11:16.969 --> 00:11:18.053
One sweetie.

202
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:20.556
One sweetie?

203
00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:22.808
-Yes
-That's food?

204
00:11:24.977 --> 00:11:25.936
Go and go bathe.

205
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.981
Your dinner's soon ready. One sweetie...

206
00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:31.608
What you cooking. aunty?

207
00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:33.485
Leave your sister. Think I didn't see you?

208
00:11:34.528 --> 00:11:35.904
I said to go bathe!

209
00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:37.739
Yes. aunty.

210
00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:43.912
[Cat] So I figure to do what I have to do.

211
00:11:43.996 --> 00:11:45.622
-[banging]
-I should go to the yard

212
00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:47.374
and hang out
where the neighborhood gangsters

213
00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.042
and killers hang out.

214
00:11:50.294 --> 00:11:52.337
Maybe they’ll rub off on me.

215
00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:55.299
Give me the courage
to revenge my father’s death.

216
00:11:57.968 --> 00:12:01.263
These guys here are the ones you’ll see
if you get out of line with the Don.

217
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.601
That is. if he don’t
come kill you himself.

218
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.937
And once I get rid of Mr. Joiner.

219
00:12:09.563 --> 00:12:11.231
I’ll become one of them.

220
00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.693
With that comes power.

221
00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.069
Not much.

222
00:12:16.862 --> 00:12:18.989
but some money doing
little jobs here and there.

223
00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:22.201
[reggae music]

224
00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:33.253

Good. man.

230
00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:46.141
Let me ask you a question.

231
00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:48.477
Why is the man still breathing?

232
00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:51.980
I'm just going to feel him out. Get me.

233
00:12:52.898 --> 00:12:54.441
Feel him out. You love. man?

234
00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:58.070
Murder. you have to murder him. you know.

235
00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.364
Yeah. man. I'm going murder him.

236
00:13:00.447 --> 00:13:02.199
but you have to murder him
when he drop him guard.

Cat.

238
00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.872
You see. this gangster life you choose.
it's not an easy thing.

239
00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:10.958
You could be dead.

240
00:13:12.584 --> 00:13:14.962
-Trust me. you'd be dead.
-Real talk. man.

241
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:17.214
It's either your life.

242
00:13:18.215 --> 00:13:19.883
-Or his life.
-His life.

-Yeah. man…
-Go where you got to go. watch him.

246

Go on like killer. watch it. you know.

He not ready yet. you know.
He feel like him ready.

249
00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:43.782
[Cat] There I was looking for a job.

250
00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:47.327
And ended up with one to kill
in the name of revenge.

251
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.788
Serious shit for a kid.

252
00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:54.042
My father used to say
that when you kill a man.

253
00:13:54.126 --> 00:13:57.129
his ghost is a slave to you until you die.

254
00:13:57.963 --> 00:14:01.133
So my father's ghost
must be a slave to Mr. Joiner.

255
00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:05.470
It’s like the ghost is a slave
to his killer. begging to be set free.

256
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.140
But I can set him free.

257
00:14:09.558 --> 00:14:12.853
All I have to do is walk in that store.

258
00:14:12.936 --> 00:14:15.856
pull out the gun and pull the trigger.

259
00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:20.152
But what if Mr. Joiner’s ghost haunts me?

260
00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.322
Now that’s scary.

They say you have to watch where you go
because the streets are dangerous.

333

The cops will kill you
for no reason if you’re Black.

[Ms. Wilson]
Chapter six to include Ms. Haze

352
00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:35.921
on what we have already
encompassed ourselves.

353
00:21:36.004 --> 00:21:38.924
is you don't have to be a
first generation immigrant to...

354
00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:42.094
Excuse us. we have visitor.

Hello. hello. class. working hard I see.

356
00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:48.308
Ms. Wilson.
I want you to meet Nigel Malone.

357
00:21:48.392 --> 00:21:50.018
He's a transfer student from Jamaica.

358
00:21:50.102 --> 00:21:51.436
Hello. Nigel.

359
00:21:52.187 --> 00:21:54.106
It's a pleasure to have you in my class.

360
00:21:55.232 --> 00:21:57.442
You can take that seat right there.

361
00:21:57.526 --> 00:21:58.777
And here. let me give you this.

362
00:21:58.861 --> 00:22:01.196
We are talking about the American Dream.

363
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.323
and how the individual defines it.

364
00:22:03.407 --> 00:22:04.867
Nigel. why don't you have a seat?

365
00:22:09.454 --> 00:22:10.831
So...

366
00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:13.750
That's what chapter six
was about. but moving on.

367
00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:16.170
Today. being born in this country.

368
00:22:16.253 --> 00:22:18.255
you can do anything
you've set your mind to.

369
00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:20.632
It is the American dream.
it's what we are known

370
00:22:20.716 --> 00:22:22.342
around the world to have. right?

371
00:22:22.926 --> 00:22:24.636
The fact is. we live in America.

372
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.680
you're born here. you have the freedom.

373
00:22:26.763 --> 00:22:29.016
-I'm Karen.
-Cat.

374
00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:32.519
Cat? I thought it was Nigel.

375
00:22:32.603 --> 00:22:35.898
[chuckles] Yeah. but I rather Cat.

376
00:22:36.565 --> 00:22:39.401
-[Ms. Wilson] Okay. so...
-Hmm. Okay. Cat.

377
00:22:39.484 --> 00:22:42.654
-[Ms. Wilson] Ah. excuse me.
-It's nice to meet you.

378
00:22:42.738 --> 00:22:45.032
-Likewise.
-[Ms. Wilson] Karen?

379
00:22:45.115 --> 00:22:46.658
Would you mind speaking a little louder?

380
00:22:46.742 --> 00:22:48.452
I'm sure the rest
of the class is interested

381
00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:49.703
in what you have to say.

382
00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:53.373
I-- I wasn't saying anything.

383
00:22:53.457 --> 00:22:56.001
[Ms. Wilson] Shawn. what is your view
of the American Dream?

384
00:22:57.336 --> 00:23:00.047
I think the American Dream
should be for Americans.

385
00:23:00.797 --> 00:23:02.424
[Cat] And there you have it.

386
00:23:02.508 --> 00:23:05.886
"Welcome to America. motherfucker."

387
00:23:05.969 --> 00:23:07.554
[bell ringing]

388
00:23:08.764 --> 00:23:10.849
-[girl] Hey. girl.
-[Karen] Hey.

389
00:23:17.898 --> 00:23:20.692
-Need help with that?
-Yeah.

390
00:23:20.776 --> 00:23:22.027
Well. what's the combination?

391
00:23:23.362 --> 00:23:25.489
Don't worry. I'm not going to rob you.

392
00:23:32.955 --> 00:23:34.957
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

393
00:23:35.624 --> 00:23:38.544
-My locker is right here.
-I see you like fucking with coconuts.

394
00:23:38.627 --> 00:23:40.796
-[Karen] You're such an asshole.
-Yeah. is that what you think of me?

395
00:23:40.879 --> 00:23:42.422
-Yo. why don't you back up a little bit?
-Alright.

396
00:23:42.506 --> 00:23:44.091
Stop it. Shawn. come on now.

397
00:23:44.174 --> 00:23:46.218
What. you think you're tough.

398
00:23:47.344 --> 00:23:48.387
Yo. boy.

399
00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:50.764
Fuck with me and I will gut you.

400
00:23:54.184 --> 00:23:56.144
-Shit.
-My goodness.

401
00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:59.731
Alright. I'm going

402
00:23:59.815 --> 00:24:02.192
-I will wait for you.

00:24:02.276 --> 00:24:03.861

Yo. what's going on?

407
00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:21.295
I hear that your yardie say
that you came from Jamaica. That true?

408
00:24:22.129 --> 00:24:24.590
-Yeah.
-Nice.

409
00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:28.302
[chuckles]

410
00:24:29.219 --> 00:24:32.139
Yo. I am the one they call Bandit.

411
00:24:32.681 --> 00:24:35.684
-This is Ozzie. that's Prince.
-Big up.

412
00:24:36.602 --> 00:24:37.603
Cat.

413
00:24:38.687 --> 00:24:40.898
-Which part of Jamaica you come from?
-Kingston.

414
00:24:40.981 --> 00:24:43.233
-Yeah? Which part of Kingston?
-Mm-hmm.

415
00:24:43.317 --> 00:24:46.486
-Kingston 12.
-Bumbaclaat...

416
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.488
That's where my family come from. dog.

417
00:24:48.572 --> 00:24:50.866
-Supposed to know my uncle then?
-What's his name?

418
00:24:51.408 --> 00:24:52.326
General.

419
00:24:52.409 --> 00:24:54.077
[chuckles] Yeah. man.

420
00:24:54.161 --> 00:24:56.538
I know that man real good. yo.

421
00:24:56.622 --> 00:25:00.000
Yeah. man. that's the boss.
You know that family thing I deal with?

422
00:25:00.083 --> 00:25:01.335
So what's going on?

423
00:25:10.552 --> 00:25:12.930
-So how was school today?
-Crisp.

424
00:25:13.013 --> 00:25:14.515
And. you make any friends?

425
00:25:14.598 --> 00:25:16.517
Yeah. met a few youths from yard.

426
00:25:16.975 --> 00:25:17.809
Cat.

427
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.438
I don't want you mixed up
with them Jamaicans over here. now.

428
00:25:21.522 --> 00:25:25.776
Because all they do is get themselves
in trouble and sell drugs.

429
00:25:26.735 --> 00:25:30.864
Mama tell you something. I didn't send all
the way to Jamaica for you to come here

430
00:25:30.948 --> 00:25:33.033
for you to get yourself in trouble
in these people country.

431
00:25:33.116 --> 00:25:35.202
They will lock you up
and throw away the key.

432
00:25:35.285 --> 00:25:37.120
Carol. I'm not laughing.
This is serious business.

433
00:25:37.204 --> 00:25:39.998
Alright. I will not make
nothing but Yankee friend then.

434
00:25:42.125 --> 00:25:43.293
[mother] They're worst.

435
00:25:43.877 --> 00:25:46.463
All they do is kill each other
everyday over nothing.

436
00:25:46.547 --> 00:25:48.715
Then it is the same thing in Jamaica.

437
00:25:49.758 --> 00:25:52.010
Uh-uh. No. it is not.

438
00:25:52.636 --> 00:25:54.012
It is different.

439
00:25:54.096 --> 00:25:59.017
I raised you to be
a respectable. decent young man.

440
00:25:59.518 --> 00:26:01.395
Who have respect for women.

441
00:26:01.478 --> 00:26:03.063
I raised you to be a real man.

442
00:26:03.647 --> 00:26:05.774
That's how I raised you.
It's not the same.

443
00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:08.068
So what. then?

444
00:26:08.986 --> 00:26:11.864
You want me to keep the Yankee friend
or my Jamaican friend?

445
00:26:15.075 --> 00:26:16.785
It's better you keep the Jamaican friends.

446
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.163
At least you can
trust them a little better

447
00:26:20.247 --> 00:26:21.915
than the Yankee boys. then. Hmm.

448
00:26:22.666 --> 00:26:23.500
Hmm.

449
00:26:27.546 --> 00:26:28.380
Hmm.

450
00:26:32.634 --> 00:26:35.596
[indistinct chatter]

451
00:26:37.514 --> 00:26:39.725
-What the fuck is up now. nigga?
-You don't know me. boy.

452
00:26:39.808 --> 00:26:41.602
Nigga. I told you this shit wasn't over.

453
00:26:41.685 --> 00:26:43.437
Bumbaclaat. the fuck is going on here?

454
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.397
Stay out of this. this shit
ain't got nothing to do with you.

455
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.608
Suck your mother's pussy.
this is my brother.

456
00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:49.776
-Trust.
-You think I ain't going to do nothing?

457
00:26:52.905 --> 00:26:55.908
[upbeat music]

458
00:27:14.676 --> 00:27:16.303
[Karen] That bruise looks bad.

459
00:27:16.386 --> 00:27:19.097
If this looks bad you should've
seen the boy Shawn's face.

460
00:27:19.181 --> 00:27:22.351
-[laughs] Oh. man.
-[chuckles]

461
00:27:22.434 --> 00:27:24.645
-You crazy.
-He started it.

462
00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.566
So do they have burgers in Jamaica?

463
00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.152
-They're the best.
-[chuckles] Yeah. right.

464
00:27:32.236 --> 00:27:35.113
I'm serious. Jamaicans invented
the burger. You didn't know?

465
00:27:35.781 --> 00:27:38.492
-What's it made of. oxtail and curry?
-[chuckles]

466
00:27:38.575 --> 00:27:40.202
-And jerk seasoning.
-Yeah!

467
00:27:40.285 --> 00:27:42.538
[both laughing]

468
00:27:43.288 --> 00:27:44.289
You're funny.

469
00:27:46.583 --> 00:27:48.252
Did you go to the college seminar?

470
00:27:48.335 --> 00:27:49.253
Yeah. I went.

471
00:27:51.213 --> 00:27:52.798
And what colleges did you pick?

472
00:27:53.632 --> 00:27:55.259
I signed up for the Marines.

473
00:27:55.342 --> 00:27:56.385
Cat. are you crazy?

474
00:27:57.886 --> 00:28:01.598
As opposed to taking out a loan and going
to college. you rather face death?

475
00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:04.977
People dying today that never died before.

476
00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:21.618
[upbeat music]

477
00:28:47.477 --> 00:28:48.812
Oh. my God!

478
00:28:48.896 --> 00:28:52.191
Look at my son. Oh. God! Look at my son.

479
00:28:52.274 --> 00:28:54.193
[cheering]

480
00:28:54.276 --> 00:28:55.277
-Welcome home.
-Yo.

481
00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.445
What's going on?

482
00:28:59.865 --> 00:29:01.700
-Keep this. you know.
-[chuckles]

483
00:29:01.783 --> 00:29:05.120
This is rice and peas? Taste like
fried rice from the Chinese man.

484
00:29:05.204 --> 00:29:09.458
Cat. she swear she can cook.
Don't bother her too much. man. she tries.

485
00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:11.251
-[laughing]
-Mama.

486
00:29:11.335 --> 00:29:13.712
-Yes. baby?
-What you want to talk to me about?

487
00:29:13.795 --> 00:29:15.923
Lord Jesus. Cat. man. That can wait.

488
00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:18.592
-You just came home. man. eat up.
-[chuckles]

489
00:29:18.675 --> 00:29:19.885
Eat up your food.

490
00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:21.637
I don't think it can wait. Mommy.

491
00:29:25.766 --> 00:29:27.184
She have multiple myeloma.

492
00:29:27.893 --> 00:29:28.727
What's that?

493
00:29:29.645 --> 00:29:31.188
-It's a cancer.
-What?

494
00:29:34.525 --> 00:29:35.567
Cancer?

495
00:29:38.237 --> 00:29:40.822
What… how come I'm just hearing this?

496
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.368
Cat. sorry you have to
come home to news like this.

497
00:29:44.451 --> 00:29:46.119
[Cat] What are the doctors saying?

498
00:29:47.204 --> 00:29:48.121
Hmm?

499
00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:50.707
They told her she gotta have chemo.

500
00:29:52.042 --> 00:29:54.211
After that. she would need
a bone marrow transplant.

501
00:29:57.005 --> 00:29:59.299
But it's money we are worried about.

502
00:29:59.383 --> 00:30:01.635
The insurance is not
going to cover all of it.

503
00:30:02.302 --> 00:30:04.596
Carol. let's talk about something else.
now. baby. please?

504
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.099
We have to find ways to raise money!

505
00:30:07.182 --> 00:30:08.976
What in the world did I just say. Carol?

506
00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:11.103
[Cat] Come on. Mama. sit down. sit down.

507
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:14.064
Um...

508
00:30:16.233 --> 00:30:19.903
Now that you home.
what do you plan for the baby?

509
00:30:19.987 --> 00:30:21.697
Don't worry about that. Mama.

510
00:30:22.447 --> 00:30:24.825
I'll just go on the G.I. bill
and get a job.

511
00:30:25.742 --> 00:30:27.703
You need to go by to the Fresh Food.

512
00:30:27.786 --> 00:30:30.998
Mr. Brown still working
up there and he is the manager.

513
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.792
He knows all about you. you know.

514
00:30:33.876 --> 00:30:35.961
Because I used to always brag about you.

515
00:30:36.044 --> 00:30:37.921
You're going to send him
to work with that man. then?

516
00:30:38.463 --> 00:30:40.507
You know he is rude and disrespectful.

517
00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:44.970
Everybody know Mr. Brown rude and
disrespectful and turn bad already. Carol.

518
00:30:45.846 --> 00:30:48.223
You can work around it. baby. Go up there.

519
00:30:49.349 --> 00:30:52.644
And if you go up there.
I will let you use the car.

520
00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.271

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.263
In that case. no fucking problem.

866
00:54:23.347 --> 00:54:24.932
I will send it to my brother in Atlanta.

867
00:54:25.015 --> 00:54:26.141
Cool.

868
00:54:27.726 --> 00:54:30.020
Keep it up. Bandit. keep it up.

869
00:54:30.103 --> 00:54:31.313
[bird chirping]

870
00:54:32.064 --> 00:54:34.316
Looks like you just bought
yourself a new Rolex. huh?

871
00:54:34.399 --> 00:54:35.859
Talking to dead bodies now?

872
00:54:44.826 --> 00:54:46.537
Looks like the next stop is the pawnshop.

873
00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:48.747
Time to find the killer
who killed the killer.

874
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:51.250
Talk about job security.

875
00:54:52.167 --> 00:54:53.460
[chuckles]

876
00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.134
I'm going to call her later.
What else is happening?

877
00:55:07.391 --> 00:55:09.101
Just tell her I borrowed it or something.

878
00:55:10.769 --> 00:55:12.938
Then tell her I won the lottery.

879
00:55:13.814 --> 00:55:15.190
Yo. I have to run.

880
00:55:16.275 --> 00:55:17.901
-What's going on. General?
-What's up?

881
00:55:20.487 --> 00:55:24.283
-I dumped the jewelry on Bobby.
-Nice. What happened to the works?

882
00:55:24.366 --> 00:55:27.077
I got rid of eight to ten bricks
at 32 a pop.

883
00:55:27.619 --> 00:55:30.289
My nephew James. he got the other two.
He going to break them down.

884
00:55:30.372 --> 00:55:31.915
should be done in the next couple of days.

885
00:55:31.999 --> 00:55:32.833
[Cat] Alright.

886
00:55:34.793 --> 00:55:37.045
Good evening. gentlemen.
what can I get for you tonight?

887
00:55:38.046 --> 00:55:41.091
-Uh. get me the same thing as him.
-[waitress] Okay.

888
00:55:41.175 --> 00:55:42.676
And what can I get for you. sir?

889
00:55:45.637 --> 00:55:47.472
-Jerk chicken.
-[waitress] I'm sorry.

890
00:55:47.556 --> 00:55:49.766
but we don't serve jerk chicken here.

891
00:55:50.559 --> 00:55:53.187
-Why not?
-Because this isn't a Jamaican--

892
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:55.606
Just bring everybody
the same thing I'm having.

893
00:55:55.689 --> 00:55:57.608
Okay. no problem. I'll be back.

894
00:56:00.402 --> 00:56:02.321
-Yo. what happened to James?
-Yeah. I been meaning to talk to you

895
00:56:02.404 --> 00:56:03.989
about putting him down or something.

896
00:56:04.615 --> 00:56:07.492
You like James. Bring him
and let me see where he fits in.

897
00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:12.289
After that. I have a job I have
been working on for a while now.

898
00:56:12.372 --> 00:56:15.626
This man is the middle man
for a Chinese drug dealer.

899
00:56:15.709 --> 00:56:18.837
Customs at JFK signs off
on anything they need.

900
00:56:19.838 --> 00:56:22.466
His problem is he likes fucking strippers

901
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:23.842
and telling them his business.

902
00:56:23.926 --> 00:56:25.886
[all laughing]

903
00:56:25.969 --> 00:56:28.138
Yo. so let us do this. What's the plan?

904
00:56:28.222 --> 00:56:30.766
Alright. come. I am going to give you
this man's phone number.

905
00:56:48.784 --> 00:56:50.202
Can I help you. gentlemen?

906
00:56:52.454 --> 00:56:54.039
We are looking for this watch.

907
00:56:58.126 --> 00:56:59.795
Nothing like that here.

908
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:06.635
-Any guns for sale?
-That's illegal in New York City.

909
00:57:06.718 --> 00:57:08.637
And I run a clean pawnshop here.

910
00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.806
You know. I bet you never met someone

911
00:57:11.348 --> 00:57:13.851
with superpowers before today.

912
00:57:14.852 --> 00:57:20.691
I look at someone and my powers
tell me this motherfucker is lying.

913
00:57:22.234 --> 00:57:24.987
Hold up. what? It's saying. it's saying

914
00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:28.282
the two guys who walked
out here. before we walked in.

915
00:57:28.365 --> 00:57:30.158
sold you an illegal gun.

916
00:57:32.703 --> 00:57:37.749
So now all I have to do is
get a warrant and find the gun.

917
00:57:37.833 --> 00:57:43.172
Lock you up and put you
out of business for good!

918
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.428
Okay. maybe I have a watch
that looks like that.

919
00:57:49.511 --> 00:57:51.889
You hear that? Maybe he's got
a watch that looks like that.

920
00:57:51.972 --> 00:57:54.349
That's-- May I see it. please?

921
00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:06.445
I'm going to need more than that.

922
00:58:07.279 --> 00:58:09.740
It's just not enough. man.
I mean. all we got

923
00:58:09.823 --> 00:58:12.326
is receiving stolen property.
if he doesn't talk.

924
00:58:15.245 --> 00:58:16.788
I don't think he is going to talk.

925
00:58:19.958 --> 00:58:21.793
We need something
to bring this all together.

926
00:58:23.462 --> 00:58:24.421
You know what?

927
00:58:25.506 --> 00:58:27.132
Go get Paul. Call him in here.

928
00:58:28.383 --> 00:58:29.676
I think I got an idea.

929
00:58:31.512 --> 00:58:35.891
[police siren wailing]

930
00:58:43.982 --> 00:58:46.693
Sir. I need you to step out of the car.

931
00:58:46.777 --> 00:58:50.030
But... why? I'm not coming out
of my bumbaclaat car.

932
00:58:50.113 --> 00:58:52.783
[female police]
Step out of the fucking car. motherfucker!

933
00:58:57.788 --> 00:58:59.540
You. let's go. Phone call time.

Let's go. move it!

935
00:59:01.416 --> 00:59:03.126
I don't got all day. let's go.

936

937
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:08.966
Yo. let's go!

943
00:59:42.916 --> 00:59:46.086
Brother. You call me

and cutting two cakes. [chuckles]

945
00:59:48.297 --> 00:59:51.508
Yo. my dog.
Police have me at central booking.

946
00:59:52.217 --> 00:59:54.178
-For what?
-They pull me over

947
00:59:54.261 --> 00:59:55.554
for some license shit.

948
00:59:55.637 --> 00:59:58.473
And they come tow my car.
so I need a ride. yes?

949
00:59:58.974 --> 01:00:01.435
A lie. Alright.

950
01:00:01.518 --> 01:00:02.519
Ah. cool. hurry up.

951
01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:04.021
I'll step on it.

952

Like. really. Ozzie? What the fuck?

You really going to get up and leave.

I brought a sexy girl for you
to have a threesome.

956

Please. don't make her leave.

957
01:00:17.743 --> 01:00:19.119
I will be back soon.

958

You know what. Ozzie. fuck you!

959
01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:23.248
And don't come back to my house either.

And took me to the precinct.

983
01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:42.911
Just to find out my license
is not even suspended. dog.

984
01:01:42.995 --> 01:01:45.914
What? That's some bullshit.
you know that. right?

985
01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:48.750
-Fuckers.
-The boys try to meet their quota.

986
01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:51.461
Yo. listen. Fuck the police!

987
01:01:51.545 --> 01:01:54.214
I want to tell the whole NYPD
to go suck their mother.

988
01:01:56.717 --> 01:01:58.552
Alright. Listen to this.

989
01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:03.056
We have to speed up things
and line up some more jux.

990
01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:05.350
-Yo.
-We have to get some more money.

991
01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:06.852
That's what I want to hear. dog.

992
01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:07.811
Yeah. man.

993
01:02:08.395 --> 01:02:10.898
Look. I'm going to need two more
of you to take care of things.

994
01:02:10.981 --> 01:02:14.318
We already have James. so one
more youth we're gonna need.

995
01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:17.654
Yo. I think I know somebody
who I can bring to the team.

996
01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:18.780
Who is that?

997
01:02:18.864 --> 01:02:20.991
It's a brother I just met
at central booking.

998
01:02:21.074 --> 01:02:23.368
Alright. bring him
so I can meet him first.

[gunshot]

1003
01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:39.843
You can leave with us
or you can die with him?

1004
01:02:40.344 --> 01:02:43.096
We have to shutdown and
relax until things cool off.

1005
01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.975
At this point. things are
way out of control. Fucked up!

1006
01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:52.397
We cannot afford to screw this up.

1007
01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:55.067
-And where the hell is Paul?
-He is on his way.

1008
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:58.737
-Johnson. call the DA and update them.
-Yes. sir.

[Anderson] I want these guys
off the streets today.

[Cat] It's fight or flight mode
from here on out.

1011
01:03:04.368 --> 01:03:08.497
but with the cops involved.
the fight will be with a gun.

1012
01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:12.626
If I lose. it's
the cemetery or the courtroom.

1013
01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:14.878
Either way. it's not my first choice.

1014

[sirens wailing]

1015
01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:18.131
So for now. I have to take flight.

Lock 'em down. Lock 'em down.

-Fuck you!
-Traitor.

1026

You forced me to commit murder.

[Anderson] Damnit. Paul.

1031
01:04:36.585 --> 01:04:39.046
Did you have to kill the only suspect?

1032
01:04:39.671 --> 01:04:40.881
Any bright ideas?

1033
01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:46.094
I think we should
stake out Jameson's wake.

1034
01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:52.017
Yeah. I think so too.

1035
01:04:59.566 --> 01:05:01.902

But it's because they
want me to turn in myself.

01:24:12.219 --> 01:24:14.096
and caught one of the perps on camera.

1370
01:24:14.179 --> 01:24:17.182
Paulo Acosta. he goes
by the street name Gamble.

1371
01:24:17.266 --> 01:24:19.685
He may be connected
to the crew you're looking for.

1372
01:24:19.768 --> 01:24:20.894
Okay. thank you.

1373
01:24:26.483 --> 01:24:28.527
[Bandit] Carol. Carol.

1374
01:24:29.653 --> 01:24:31.113
Carol. Shh!

1375
01:24:31.196 --> 01:24:33.490
-What the hell?
-It's me. me. Bandit. Bandit.

1376
01:24:33.574 --> 01:24:34.783
-Yo. just go easy.
-Bandit?

1377
01:24:34.867 --> 01:24:36.285
-Shh.
-What're you doing. man?

1378
01:24:36.368 --> 01:24:37.995
Easy. man. Listen to what I have to say.

1379
01:24:38.078 --> 01:24:41.915
I have something important and I need you
to tell Cat as soon as possible.

1380
01:24:41.999 --> 01:24:43.792
-Oh. God. what's happening?
-Listen.

1381
01:24:43.876 --> 01:24:45.711
I want you to tell him the boy Cloud...

1382
01:24:47.004 --> 01:24:48.630
...is a cop.

1383
01:24:48.714 --> 01:24:50.048
Police boy.

1384
01:24:54.428 --> 01:24:57.431
Well. So far it seems all the
victims knows one another.

1385
01:24:57.514 --> 01:24:59.308
and party together on the weekends.

1386
01:24:59.391 --> 01:25:00.684
[scoffs] I think the party is

1387
01:25:00.767 --> 01:25:02.477
where they must be picking their victims.

1388
01:25:02.561 --> 01:25:04.980
-Then let's start there.
-Exactly.

1389
01:25:05.063 --> 01:25:07.232
And here's our party host. guys.

1390
01:25:07.316 --> 01:25:08.859
Now. this guy is a character.

1391
01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:11.361
Did some time for arson.

1392
01:25:11.445 --> 01:25:13.530
Now he likes to build clubs.

1393
01:25:13.614 --> 01:25:15.240
But he also likes to burn them down

1394
01:25:15.324 --> 01:25:16.825
and collect that insurance money.

1395
01:25:16.909 --> 01:25:18.702
I guess we have a party to go to.

1396
01:25:18.785 --> 01:25:21.872
-Alright. detectives. See you later.
-Talk to you later.

1397
01:25:24.166 --> 01:25:25.334
It's 560.

1398
01:25:25.417 --> 01:25:26.919
-Come on.
-Yeah.

1399
01:25:27.002 --> 01:25:28.879
[phone ringing]

1400
01:25:28.962 --> 01:25:29.963
Yo. smell that.

1401
01:25:30.589 --> 01:25:31.882
Yo. banging.

1402
01:25:32.424 --> 01:25:34.426
-Yo. sis.
-Strawberry flavor.

1403
01:25:35.177 --> 01:25:36.303
Bandit?

1404
01:25:39.264 --> 01:25:40.265
What?

1405
01:25:44.645 --> 01:25:45.646
Police.

1406
01:25:48.982 --> 01:25:50.359
You sure he told you that?

1407
01:25:51.735 --> 01:25:52.694
Thanks. sis.

1408
01:25:53.529 --> 01:25:54.446
Yo.

1409
01:25:55.781 --> 01:25:56.823
Cloud is a cop.

1410
01:25:57.866 --> 01:25:58.784
What?

1411
01:25:59.493 --> 01:26:00.702
Get the fuck outta of here.

1412
01:26:01.537 --> 01:26:02.996
That's crazy.

1413
01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.039
Fuck!

1414
01:26:05.624 --> 01:26:07.626
Yo. we have to be done
with this and move right away.

1415
01:26:16.134 --> 01:26:18.053
-[knocking on door]
-Yeah.

1416
01:26:20.305 --> 01:26:21.431
Is that the ballistic report?

1417
01:26:22.724 --> 01:26:23.684
Yeah.

1418
01:26:24.726 --> 01:26:25.561
What?

1419
01:26:27.396 --> 01:26:28.605
Why you shaking your head?

1420
01:26:29.815 --> 01:26:31.024
You're not going to like it.

1421
01:26:32.401 --> 01:26:33.694
Let me see that.

1422
01:26:46.206 --> 01:26:48.083
[sighs] Where is he?

1423
01:26:49.418 --> 01:26:50.794
He is supposed to come in tonight.

1424
01:26:52.212 --> 01:26:53.130
Fuck!

1425
01:26:55.132 --> 01:26:56.383
[sighs]

1426
01:27:02.014 --> 01:27:03.557
-[thudding]
-[Bandit] Pussy.

1427
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:09.938
[grunting]

1428
01:27:10.022 --> 01:27:12.816
[groans]

1429
01:27:13.442 --> 01:27:15.360
Dirty police boy. Get up.

1430
01:27:15.444 --> 01:27:17.070
Get up. pussy!

1431
01:27:17.154 --> 01:27:20.073
-Bumbaclaat.
-I don't think so.

1432
01:27:20.157 --> 01:27:21.325
That's gotta hurt.

1433
01:27:21.408 --> 01:27:23.827
[groans]

1434
01:27:23.911 --> 01:27:25.495
You thought I was going to take you in?

1435
01:27:27.039 --> 01:27:29.041
After you made me commit fucking murder!

1436
01:27:29.124 --> 01:27:31.001
[groans]

1437
01:27:31.585 --> 01:27:34.880
-[groans]
-I'm killing you. I'm killing Cat.

1438
01:27:34.963 --> 01:27:36.590
Every motherfucking body.

1439
01:27:37.341 --> 01:27:39.801
Oh. this feels good. Huh?

1440
01:27:39.885 --> 01:27:41.970
-Fuck you.
-Fuck me?

1441
01:27:42.054 --> 01:27:43.847
No. fuck you!

1442
01:27:43.931 --> 01:27:45.474
-[gunshot]
-[groans]

1443
01:27:46.475 --> 01:27:49.186
What do you think the front pages

1444
01:27:49.269 --> 01:27:51.897
of the newspaper is
going to say tomorrow? Huh?

1445
01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:53.774
I'm thinking...

1446
01:27:53.857 --> 01:27:55.609
[panting]

1447
01:27:55.692 --> 01:27:56.818
"Super Cop

1448
01:27:57.444 --> 01:27:59.112
killed home invader."

1449
01:27:59.196 --> 01:28:00.030
I'll tell you what...

1450
01:28:01.114 --> 01:28:04.201
...give Ozzie... my best.

1451
01:28:04.284 --> 01:28:05.953
-Freeze!
-Freeze!

1452
01:28:06.703 --> 01:28:08.914
This motherfucker broke in my house.

1453
01:28:08.997 --> 01:28:10.666
Don't even think about it. Paul.

1454
01:28:14.545 --> 01:28:15.587
[grunts]

1455
01:28:16.839 --> 01:28:19.174
It's alright. Paul. just procedure.

1456
01:28:19.258 --> 01:28:21.468
-[Paul] Alright. what the fuck you doing?
-[Anderson] Calm down.

1457
01:28:22.302 --> 01:28:24.638
[grunting] Okay.

1458
01:28:28.934 --> 01:28:31.520
[Bandit laughing]

1459
01:28:32.104 --> 01:28:33.647
-[spits]
-Hey!

1460
01:28:33.730 --> 01:28:35.482
[laughing]

1461
01:28:36.066 --> 01:28:39.444
Goddamn psycho. Would somebody
get these cuffs off me. please?

1462
01:28:39.528 --> 01:28:40.821
No. they stay on. Paul.

1463
01:28:42.281 --> 01:28:44.575
-Why. what's going on?
-You're under arrest for murder.

1464
01:28:44.658 --> 01:28:46.034
What are you talking about?

1465
01:28:46.118 --> 01:28:47.953
Someone mailed a gun to the DA's office

1466
01:28:48.036 --> 01:28:49.496
that was involved in a murder-robbery.

1467
01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:52.165
-So what?
-Had your prints on it.

1468
01:28:52.249 --> 01:28:54.626
No. no. no. Wait. wait. wait.
Wait. let me explain.

1469
01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:57.254
He set me up.
They set me up. He set me up!

1470
01:28:57.337 --> 01:28:58.881
Somebody get these cuffs off me!

1471
01:29:00.299 --> 01:29:02.759
[scoffs] You should get a lawyer. Paul.

1472
01:29:02.843 --> 01:29:04.595
What you talking about. "Get a lawyer"?

1473
01:29:04.678 --> 01:29:06.221
I didn't fucking kill nobody!

1474
01:29:06.305 --> 01:29:11.143
[laughing]

1475
01:29:14.146 --> 01:29:16.106
I need to talk to Mr. Rosenberg.

1476
01:29:19.568 --> 01:29:20.986
My name is Nigel Malone.

1477
01:29:21.069 --> 01:29:24.114
and I am calling in reference
to my mother's immigration issues.

1478
01:29:27.993 --> 01:29:31.038
Mr. Rosenberg. this is Cat.

1479
01:29:31.121 --> 01:29:32.664
Gamble told me to call you.

1480
01:29:32.748 --> 01:29:34.625
He said you can help me with my mother.

1481
01:29:39.254 --> 01:29:42.883
[upbeat music]

1482
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:03.070
Ah. there he goes. That's my man.

1483
01:30:03.153 --> 01:30:06.156
-Dino. how's everything?
-Hey. Gamble baby. how do you do?

1484
01:30:07.199 --> 01:30:08.784
Aww. man. thank you. brother.

1485
01:30:08.867 --> 01:30:09.993
Alright. alright.

1486
01:30:10.536 --> 01:30:12.162
-Mm.
-Hey. listen.

1487
01:30:12.246 --> 01:30:13.956
Honor to have you present in my home. man.

1488
01:30:14.039 --> 01:30:15.749
Well. you the man of the hour. brother.

1489
01:30:15.832 --> 01:30:18.001
-How's dad. how's the family?
-Everybody's good. listen. man.

1490
01:30:18.085 --> 01:30:19.378
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1491
01:30:19.461 --> 01:30:20.879
My father could really
use someone like you

1492
01:30:20.963 --> 01:30:21.964
in his business. man.

1493
01:30:22.673 --> 01:30:25.259
I don't really have-- I don't
have that Gamble swag. man.

1494
01:30:25.342 --> 01:30:26.677
-Really?
-What do you think?

1495
01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.595
-Let's talk about it.
-You wanna talk about it?

1496
01:30:28.679 --> 01:30:29.888
-Let's talk about it.
-Alright.

1497
01:30:30.472 --> 01:30:32.182
-Mm.
-Come this way.

1498
01:30:34.101 --> 01:30:36.645
[Gamble] You babysitting it though. man.
Go on finish that drink. man.

1499
01:30:36.728 --> 01:30:39.189
-You want me to finish this shit. man?
-Take it back. huh?

1500
01:30:39.273 --> 01:30:41.483
There you go. let me
get you something else. right?

1501
01:30:41.567 --> 01:30:43.735
Hold on right there. Hold on right there.

1502
01:30:43.819 --> 01:30:46.029
Whoa. easy now. I got you.

1503
01:30:46.113 --> 01:30:48.615
-Come on. let me take you in the back.
-In the back?

1504
01:30:48.699 --> 01:30:50.200
[Gamble] Take you in the back.

1505
01:30:50.284 --> 01:30:52.286
[knocking on door]

1506
01:30:56.957 --> 01:31:00.002
Officers. what is so important
that you have to bother me at home?

1507
01:31:00.085 --> 01:31:02.212
-Good evening. Judge.
-Judge. we have a warrant

1508
01:31:02.296 --> 01:31:03.881
that urgently needs your signature.

1509
01:31:06.466 --> 01:31:08.677
So you have enough evidence
to support a warrant?

1510
01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.678
Yes. sir.

1511
01:31:10.846 --> 01:31:12.723
I'm curious. who's at this party?

1512
01:31:12.806 --> 01:31:14.683
We're investigating a robbery gang

1513
01:31:14.766 --> 01:31:16.518
that's been targeting
high-profile citizens.

1514
01:31:16.602 --> 01:31:18.145
Now we have reason to believe
that they're choosing

1515
01:31:18.228 --> 01:31:19.980
their victims at this party.

1516
01:31:20.063 --> 01:31:22.774
So. you want to raid the party?

1517
01:31:22.858 --> 01:31:25.444
Yes. sir. And hopefully.
capture the suspects.

1518
01:31:25.527 --> 01:31:27.070
And what if you find nothing?

1519
01:31:27.779 --> 01:31:29.281
I have a hunch we will.

1520
01:31:29.364 --> 01:31:31.408
We've been working this case
for a while now. Judge.

1521
01:31:31.491 --> 01:31:34.203
Now. you know I can't issue
a warrant on a hunch.

1522
01:31:34.286 --> 01:31:35.537
Come on. Judge.

1523
01:31:35.621 --> 01:31:36.997
If this thing doesn't go right.

1524
01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.332
and a lawsuit drops.

1525
01:31:38.415 --> 01:31:40.000
I'm the one that's in the fire

1526
01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:42.544
as the judge that issued this warrant.

1527
01:31:42.628 --> 01:31:44.880
And I can't afford the heat.
it's an election year.

1528
01:31:44.963 --> 01:31:47.549
Sir. I don't think
things will go that far.

1529
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:50.677
I don't think I will be able
to help you out on this one.

1530
01:31:51.261 --> 01:31:54.431
-Judge. please.
-Goodnight. gentlemen. goodnight.

1531
01:31:57.601 --> 01:31:58.560
Goodnight.

1532
01:31:59.311 --> 01:32:02.231
-Oh. yeah.
-I feel dizzy. Gamble.

1533
01:32:04.525 --> 01:32:06.401
-I want to go outside.
-Hold on. bitch.

1534
01:32:06.485 --> 01:32:11.240
[moaning]

1535
01:32:11.323 --> 01:32:12.491
Oh. fuck!

1536
01:32:14.618 --> 01:32:15.661
Fuck!

1537
01:32:19.831 --> 01:32:22.292
Damn. bitch. you heavy. Oh. fuck.

1538
01:32:22.376 --> 01:32:26.213
[upbeat music]

1539
01:32:26.296 --> 01:32:27.673
Wake the fuck up!

1540
01:32:28.257 --> 01:32:29.800
Wake the fuck up!

1541
01:32:29.883 --> 01:32:31.301
Wake up. bitch!

01:32:31.385 --> 01:32:33.595
[laughing]

1543
01:32:33.679 --> 01:32:35.389
-Alright.
-What the fuck is wrong with y'all?

1544
01:32:35.472 --> 01:32:37.891
[Cat] Now that
I have everybody's attention.

1545
01:32:39.309 --> 01:32:41.395
Except for this man here.

1546
01:32:42.396 --> 01:32:44.314
Let me start by saying.

1547
01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:46.483
If you want to live.

1548
01:32:47.317 --> 01:32:49.903
you listen and do exactly
what I tell you to do.

1549
01:32:49.987 --> 01:32:52.281
If you don't want to listen.

1550
01:32:52.364 --> 01:32:53.907
shake your head now.

1551
01:32:56.410 --> 01:32:59.121
Everybody. Give me your key.

1552
01:32:59.204 --> 01:33:01.999
Security code. And tell me exactly

1553
01:33:02.082 --> 01:33:05.961
which part of your house where
your money or your jewelry is.

1554
01:33:06.044 --> 01:33:09.214
If the information
you give me is right. you live.

1555
01:33:09.298 --> 01:33:12.134
If it's wrong. you're all going to die.

1556
01:33:12.801 --> 01:33:14.636
Before we go into your house.

1557
01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:17.598
We're gonna call our friend
who is here keeping you company.

1558
01:33:18.265 --> 01:33:22.144
And we going to stay on the
phone until we left your house.

1559
01:33:24.062 --> 01:33:25.856
Anything goes wrong.

1560
01:33:27.274 --> 01:33:28.775
Everybody dead.

1561
01:33:28.859 --> 01:33:31.862
[upbeat music]

1562
01:33:57.804 --> 01:33:59.681
I have a suspect in sight.

1563
01:33:59.765 --> 01:34:01.642
Entering a grey Honda.

1564
01:34:01.725 --> 01:34:04.478
Plate number RKZ-552.

1565
01:34:04.561 --> 01:34:06.563
Tail him. we'll follow you.

1566

-[knocking on door]
-Who the fuck is that?

1567
01:34:28.836 --> 01:34:30.003
Hold on. hold on. Hold on.

1568
01:34:33.799 --> 01:34:34.675
Gamble.

1569
01:34:39.221 --> 01:34:41.014
-What's up. Slime?
-What's up?

1570
01:34:41.098 --> 01:34:42.516
Good fucking work. gentlemen.

1571
01:34:42.599 --> 01:34:44.059
-good fucking work.
-See what I am dealing with.

1572
01:34:44.142 --> 01:34:45.352
I told you. this is no joke business.

1573
01:34:47.396 --> 01:34:48.981
[female police over radio]
Why not raid the room now?

1574
01:34:49.064 --> 01:34:50.941
What if it's just a pit stop?

1575
01:34:51.024 --> 01:34:52.651
Or what if he is there with a woman?

1576
01:34:53.235 --> 01:34:54.152
No. we'll wait.

1577
01:34:58.448 --> 01:35:02.911
Oh. man. Yo. fellas. this is
a motherfucking come up. man. [laughs]

1578
01:35:02.995 --> 01:35:06.164
-This is a lot of motherfucking cash.
-You already know.

1579
01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:08.584
-Huh!
-Yo. let's go. got to get up out of here.

1580
01:35:09.334 --> 01:35:10.836
Alright. hold on.
I'm about to take a piss.

1581
01:35:10.919 --> 01:35:13.088
-Yo. hurry up. my youth.
-Alright. alright.

1604

Fuck!

1605
01:38:42.005 --> 01:38:43.674
[Cat] I grew up poor.

1606
01:38:43.757 --> 01:38:45.843
And growing up poor means
that I had the same dream

1607
01:38:45.926 --> 01:38:49.972
as every poor man and woman
in the ghettos around the world.

1608
01:38:50.055 --> 01:38:53.517
The dream of getting my family
and myself out of the slums.

1609
01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.143
Somehow making it big.

1610
01:38:55.811 --> 01:38:59.606
All I needed was the opportunity
to do it. A chance.

1611
01:38:59.690 --> 01:39:03.151
A shot at doing something good
to free us from this hell hole.

1612
01:39:05.028 --> 01:39:08.115
For me. only the streets
gave me a way of getting out.

1613
01:39:08.198 --> 01:39:09.658
So I chose it.

1614
01:39:09.741 --> 01:39:12.619
And for the most part. it did get me out.

1615
01:39:12.703 --> 01:39:17.332
With that the dream changed
because I am out of the ghetto.

1616
01:39:18.208 --> 01:39:21.420
Now all I want to do
is get out of the streets.

1617
01:39:21.503 --> 01:39:23.338
That’s the dream now.

1618
01:39:23.422 --> 01:39:26.133
Take all that the streets
have given me and run.

1619
01:39:27.342 --> 01:39:29.469
But that’s easier said than done.

1620
01:39:29.553 --> 01:39:32.014
Now I have enemies lurking in the dark.

1621
01:39:32.890 --> 01:39:35.434
There are cops one step behind me.

1622
01:39:36.185 --> 01:39:39.062
And there’s a life sentence
in prison waiting for me.

1623
01:39:40.314 --> 01:39:44.401
All because I took advantage of
the opportunity available to me.

1624
01:39:44.484 --> 01:39:47.487
[dramatic music]

1625
01:40:21.730 --> 01:40:24.441
My chance to get myself out of poverty.

1626
01:40:24.525 --> 01:40:27.778
Accomplish what’s been
preached to me all my life.

1627
01:40:29.321 --> 01:40:30.531
The Dream.

1628
01:40:31.698 --> 01:40:33.742
The American Dream.
