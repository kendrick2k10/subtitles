366
00:16:30.166 --> 00:16:31.000
Huh?

367
00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:34.208
Anyone need a hero?

368
00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:36.333
-[woman 1] Go away!
-[woman 2] Leave us alone!

369
00:16:36.416 --> 00:16:37.791
[man] You'll get us killed!

370
00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:40.166
Name's Monkey King.

371
00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:46.125
AKA the Simian Savior.
AKA the Legendary Demon Slayer.

372
00:16:46.208 --> 00:16:47.291
And Stick.

373
00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:50.083

kicking. a kick-pole punch combo.
the double-kick with or without Stick.

375

fake kick with a spinning pole.

376
00:16:57.583 --> 00:16:58.791
[Monkey King yells]

377
00:16:58.875 --> 00:17:00.541
-Huh! Yeah!

378
00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:01.916
Monkey King?

379
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.208
I've never heard of you.

380
00:17:03.291 --> 00:17:06.166
-Well. I've never heard of you either.
-[Stick murmurs]

381
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.750
This village needs
one of the Immortal Ones.

382
00:17:08.833 --> 00:17:11.083
-Not a monkey with a fancy stick.
-[Stick murmurs]

383
00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:13.625
This dump counts as a village? Come on!

384
00:17:13.708 --> 00:17:16.250
-He's just gonna make it worse.
-[scoffs] Get rid of him.

385
00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:18.416
Well. thanks for stopping by.

386

I don't think you're getting
how great I am--

387

He's the real deal. folks.
A living legend.

388
00:17:24.666 --> 00:17:26.625
I am? I mean. of course I am.

389
00:17:26.708 --> 00:17:29.000
If you've got a demon situation.
this is your guy.

390
00:17:29.083 --> 00:17:29.916
Huh?

391
00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.583
Where did you even come from. kid?

392
00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:35.291
I've never seen her before.
and I'm the mayor's wife.

393
00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:36.791
I know everyone!

394
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:40.250
You'd better get to know us.
Unless you wanna be demon dumplings.

395
00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:42.208
Aiya.

396
00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:44.041
Okay. Whisper time.

397
00:17:44.541 --> 00:17:46.875
Maybe the demon will eat the monkey.

398
00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.250
And leave us alone.

399
00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:50.500
Either way. we win.

400
00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:52.750
Oh. I like it. Break!

401
00:17:53.458 --> 00:17:55.375
Brave warrior.

402
00:17:55.458 --> 00:17:58.166
My poor. dear child was just kidnapped.

403
00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.500
Every rainy season.
the horrible fire beast descends--

404
00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:04.791
-Fire beast? That'll be a hundred demons.
-[Stick shouts]

405
00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:08.041
-I'm in. Okay. desperate peasants.

-Your what?
-My big victory party.

408
00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:16.583
How else will the Immortal Ones
know it's time to come get me?

409
00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:19.208
-Okay. I'll need a 35-piece orchestra.
-No!

410
00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:21.208
-A 100-person dragon dance.
-No dancing.

411
00:18:21.291 --> 00:18:24.125
And a huge fireworks extravaganza.

412
00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:25.916
My fireworks? Too expensive.

413
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Unfortunately. ours is
but a poor rice-farming village.

414
00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:31.458
-Yeah. poor.
-[girl scoffs]

415
00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:34.333
How insulting.
Come on. King. We're walking.

416
00:18:34.416 --> 00:18:35.833
-Stop them!
-Uh. uh…

417
00:18:35.916 --> 00:18:38.500
Please. won't you
and your assistant reconsider?

418
00:18:38.583 --> 00:18:42.125
Assistant? I don't know this person.
Who are you?

419
00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:44.125
Only your number one fan.

420
00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:46.375
I mean. this guy
took down the white bone demon.

421
00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:49.500
the red bone demon.
and the bone demon of no specific color.

422
00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:52.833
We could sing songs about you.
and I'll give you a grand speech.

423
00:18:52.916 --> 00:18:55.500
-And?
-Uh. name a street after you?

424
00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:56.708
-And?
-And?

425
00:18:56.791 --> 00:19:00.875
Oh. oh. oh. oh.
a big. fat shiny medal of solid brass.

426
00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:06.000
Ooh. that will impress 'em. Okay. Next up.
What's in it for my trusty companion?

427
00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:08.458
-The girl?
-No! My wondrous stick.

428
00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:11.666
-What's in it for him?
-Um. what does it want?

429
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.708
What do you want? A guitar.

430
00:19:14.958 --> 00:19:16.666
But your stick can't play the guitar.

431
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.000
[Stick groans]

432
00:19:18.083 --> 00:19:20.125
-Huh?
-[Stick murmurs]

433
00:19:20.208 --> 00:19:21.500
And ten free guitar lessons.

438
00:19:29.708 --> 00:19:32.500
Please don't let it hurt
my innocent little child!

439
00:19:32.583 --> 00:19:33.458
Don't worry.

440
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:37.750
The quicker I slay this fire demon.
the faster we get to celebrate me.

441
00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:38.708
[girl] Hm.

442
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.916
[child whimpers] Please let me go!

443
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.083

Daddy! The demon was so mean!

453
00:20:06.666 --> 00:20:07.500
There. there.

454

Wait. He's the kid?

455

What took you so long?

456
00:20:11.208 --> 00:20:12.541
We had to find a hero.

457
00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:16.166
-You're the worst daddy ever.
-[Mayor] Now. son. don't hit Daddy.

458

How dare you challenge Red Girl.
Monkey King?

462
00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:33.583
What's a Red Girl?

Hey. Red Girl. leave these poor.
unattractive people alone.

466

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.833
And this tiny thing is you.

716
00:31:13.916 --> 00:31:15.375
-Get it now?
-Huh?

717
00:31:15.458 --> 00:31:17.125
[Monkey King] I'm the universe hand.

718
00:31:17.208 --> 00:31:20.083
and you're an insignificant.
useless pebble.

719
00:31:20.875 --> 00:31:23.625
Even a tiny pebble
can make a big ripple. you know.

720
00:31:23.708 --> 00:31:27.041
[scoffs] That's just
what a tiny pebble would say.

721
00:31:27.125 --> 00:31:30.416
So. Stick. immortality. where do we go?

722
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.500
[Stick hums]

723
00:31:31.583 --> 00:31:33.333
Really? Huh.

724
00:31:33.416 --> 00:31:35.333
-But how do we get there?
-[Stick hums]

725
00:31:35.416 --> 00:31:38.041
A graveyard? Spooky.

726
00:31:38.708 --> 00:31:40.208
Huh…

727
00:31:40.291 --> 00:31:42.041
Grave… Gra…

728
00:31:42.125 --> 00:31:44.291
-Graveyard.
-You can't read.

729
00:31:44.375 --> 00:31:45.583
Of course I can.

730
00:31:45.666 --> 00:31:49.125
That's grass. That's the sky.
That's a rock. See? Reading.

731
00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:52.250
-Graveyard's that way.
-Obviously.

732
00:31:52.333 --> 00:31:55.500
-[Stick hums]
-No. no. no. no. no. We don't need her.

733
00:31:55.583 --> 00:31:58.333
-He wants me to come. Doesn't he?
-Just go home. kid.

734
00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:00.625
I can't go home.
There's trouble back there.

735
00:32:00.708 --> 00:32:02.333
and it made me do some things.

736
00:32:02.416 --> 00:32:05.416
-Things I probably shouldn't have done.
-Ooh! You killed someone?

737
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.791
-No!
-Oh.

738
00:32:06.875 --> 00:32:09.750
I just wanna do big things someday.
Like you.

739
00:32:12.875 --> 00:32:14.041
-Ow!
-[Stick murmurs]

740
00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:16.666
-I know. No. I--
-[Stick murmurs]

741
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.125
-Yes. but--
-[Stick murmurs]

742
00:32:18.208 --> 00:32:20.458
How much reading could we possibly need?

743
00:32:20.541 --> 00:32:24.166
-[Stick murmurs]
-Fine. I said fine! [sighs]

744
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:25.500
So. assistant girl.

745
00:32:26.083 --> 00:32:27.250
you coming or what?

746
00:32:27.958 --> 00:32:29.333
[Lin] So. where to next?

747
00:32:29.416 --> 00:32:33.208
[Monkey King] Oh. you'll see. [laughs]

748
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:39.333
[Monkey King] Ooh.

749
00:32:43.291 --> 00:32:46.000
In there? Us? How?

750
00:32:46.083 --> 00:32:49.041
This. It's like an all-access VIP pass.

751
00:32:49.125 --> 00:32:52.166
Any realm. any dimension.
Even the Land of the Dead.

752
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.916
But you're not dead.

753
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.291
And if all goes well. never will be.

754
00:32:56.375 --> 00:32:59.416
Okay. If we're gonna fit in.
we gotta dress the part.

755
00:33:00.708 --> 00:33:02.208
[coughs] What the heck?

756
00:33:02.291 --> 00:33:03.333
[Monkey King] Not heck.

757
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:05.083
Hell.

758
00:33:05.166 --> 00:33:06.041
[Lin screams]

759
00:33:06.125 --> 00:33:07.916
[suspenseful music crescendos]

760
00:33:08.708 --> 00:33:10.375
[Lin screams and groans]

761
00:33:12.333 --> 00:33:13.416
Try to keep up.

762
00:33:14.375 --> 00:33:15.208
[grunts]

763
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:19.416
Are we even supposed to be here?

764
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.750
Absolutely not. Isn't it great?

765
00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.750
See. the day you're supposed to die

766
00:33:23.833 --> 00:33:26.458
is recorded
in the Scroll of Life and Death.

767
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:29.208
But if my name should somehow
get crossed out.

768
00:33:29.291 --> 00:33:32.250
then no death registered.
and guess who's immortal?

769
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.333
Me! [laughs]

770
00:33:35.166 --> 00:33:36.000
[shudders]

771
00:33:36.875 --> 00:33:40.541
One more thing.
Die in hell. stay in hell. So don't die.

772
00:33:42.208 --> 00:33:43.708
This is a bad idea.

773
00:33:44.791 --> 00:33:45.625
[demon] Next.

774
00:33:45.708 --> 00:33:47.708
[ghosts whisper]

775
00:33:49.458 --> 00:33:50.916
Act like a ghost.

776
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.666
Whoo! Eee!

777
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.541
Oh yeah. Great. You're giving me chills.

778
00:33:57.625 --> 00:33:59.416
King here! Coming through!

779
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.791
Make way.

780
00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:03.875
Next! Release form. [groans]

781
00:34:03.958 --> 00:34:07.000
You brought a live chicken
to the underworld?

782
00:34:07.833 --> 00:34:09.416
No living things allowed!

783
00:34:10.458 --> 00:34:11.791
We really should go now.

784
00:34:11.875 --> 00:34:13.791
[scoffs] Watch and learn. Pebble.

785
00:34:13.875 --> 00:34:14.791
[chicken squawks]

786
00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:16.000
Oh no.

787
00:34:16.083 --> 00:34:21.416
That's better. Pit of Infinite Agony.
Fourth floor on your right. Next!

788
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:23.625
Yes. good morning.

789
00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:26.291
I'd like a quick glance
at the Life and Death Scrolls.

790
00:34:26.375 --> 00:34:28.083
Release form first.

791
00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:30.041
It's in my other armor?

792
00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:33.541
Rejected! [growls]

793
00:34:34.416 --> 00:34:36.583
-Release form.
-Back to the world of the living.

794
00:34:36.666 --> 00:34:38.291
Not so fast.

795
00:34:38.375 --> 00:34:41.375
-As my assistant. your first duty…
-[Lin groans]

796
00:34:41.458 --> 00:34:43.916
…is to be the sacrificial lamb.

797
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.375
-What are you doing?
-She's alive? Here in hell?

798
00:34:46.458 --> 00:34:47.916
-What?
-You're alive!

799
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.250
How scandalous!

800
00:34:49.333 --> 00:34:51.750
And you cut in front of all these people?

801
00:34:51.833 --> 00:34:54.666
-What?
-No living things allowed!

802
00:34:55.458 --> 00:34:57.291
-Oh. Monkey!
-[Monkey cackles]

803
00:34:57.375 --> 00:34:59.333
Uh. uh. I… I'm not…

804
00:34:59.416 --> 00:35:02.041
I couldn't be more dead.
Fresh corpse here.

805
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:04.791
How did you die?

806
00:35:04.875 --> 00:35:07.791
Old age. No. I mean scurvy. Earthquake?

807
00:35:07.875 --> 00:35:09.500
A duel. Two duels.

808
00:35:09.583 --> 00:35:10.666
Here's the story.

809
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:15.375
I fell… off a cliff
into a hole filled with sharks.

810
00:35:15.458 --> 00:35:16.625
Rabid sharks.

811
00:35:16.708 --> 00:35:18.625
And then a house fell on me.

812
00:35:18.708 --> 00:35:21.000
and I drowned. Yeah.

813
00:35:22.708 --> 00:35:24.250
Okay. you're in.

814
00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:26.208
Chamber of Ridiculous Deaths.

815
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.375
Fifth floor down the hall.

816
00:35:28.458 --> 00:35:29.708
[gasps] Hm.

817
00:35:29.791 --> 00:35:30.708
Next!

-[ghost] What a guy.

822
00:35:42.375 --> 00:35:43.416
-Hey!
-[screams]

823
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.375
Monkey! You abandoned me
in the middle of hell.

824
00:35:46.458 --> 00:35:48.541
You don't leave a teammate behind.

825
00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:53.000
What teammate? You're an assistant.
An insignificant pebble.

826
00:35:53.083 --> 00:35:55.541
-Stop calling me that.
-Absolutely.

827
00:35:55.625 --> 00:35:59.375
As soon as you find my scroll
so I can cross my name off. Come on.

-[metal clangs]

829

-[grunts] This shouldn't take long.
-[Lin gasps]

830
00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:05.833
[Lin] What?

831
00:36:06.625 --> 00:36:08.500
Get reading.

832
00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:11.208
[whistles]

833
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:13.666
What's your family name?

834
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.125
Don't have one. I was born from a rock.

835
00:36:16.625 --> 00:36:17.750
A rock?

836
00:36:17.833 --> 00:36:22.125
More of a rock egg.
The scrolls list your family history.

837
00:36:22.208 --> 00:36:24.458
I must have parents. right?

838
00:36:24.541 --> 00:36:26.166
Well. I guess.

839
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.500
Everyone does.

840
00:36:28.041 --> 00:36:32.000
Ha! Looking for your scrolls? [laughs]

841
00:36:32.083 --> 00:36:34.416
My scroll? Why does he have my scroll?

842
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.583
You don't belong here.

844
00:36:39.666 --> 00:36:43.708
Oh ho! Time to defeat demon 101.

873
00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:50.291
Monkey. I got 'em. This one's mine. Huh?

874
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:53.166
Hey! Not yours!

875
00:37:54.291 --> 00:37:57.458
What's it say about my family? [yells]

876
00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:58.583
It says

877
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.791
you don't have one.

878
00:38:01.583 --> 00:38:03.958
Oh. I'm all alone?

879
00:38:04.041 --> 00:38:05.416
I'm sorry. Monkey.

Oof! I'm an original!

[groans] Okay.
you don't have to remind me.

1828
