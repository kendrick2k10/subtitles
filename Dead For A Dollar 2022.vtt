3
00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.376
Give it up. Frank!

4
00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:38.562
- Joe Cribbens.

5
00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:43.600
- Joe Cribbens! Visitor!

6
00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:50.970
- Well. goddamn. Hard to figure
who I'd less rather see.

7
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.611
What brings a skunk
like you here?

8
00:02:54.646 --> 00:02:57.878
- I was in the neighborhood
collecting reward money.

9
00:02:57.913 --> 00:02:59.583
Thought I'd pay you a visit.

10
00:02:59.618 --> 00:03:03.356
- Yeah. Heard you took down
Frank Ledbetter last week.

11
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:07.327
We get all the news in here.
You'd be surprised.

12
00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.089
How much you gonna collect
for old Frank?

13
00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:14.301
Friend of yours?
- Never met the man.

14
00:03:14.336 --> 00:03:16.094
but I was on his side.

15
00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:22.100
Okay. bounty man. Did you give
him much of a chance?

16
00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:23.970
- Same chance he gave me.

17
00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:28.909
- Give it up. Frank!

18
00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:35.916
- Right. Just another fella
dead for a dollar.

19
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:40.019
I figure you know I'm getting
out of here next week.

20
00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:44.496
Served my time. All five years.

21
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:46.300
- I heard you've been
telling people

22
00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:48.302
first thing you were gonna do
when you walk out of here

23
00:03:48.337 --> 00:03:50.766
is get a gun and look me up.

24
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:52.570
- Don't flatter yourself.

25
00:03:52.605 --> 00:03:54.803
I'm not going out of my way
to find you.

26
00:03:55.872 --> 00:03:58.444
I'm going to head down
to Mexico.

27
00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:01.810
Just... play out the string.

28
00:04:01.845 --> 00:04:04.945
Cards. tequila. señoritas...

29
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.079
- No matter where you're headed.

30
00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:10.885
you'll still end up the same.
Horse thief.

31
00:04:12.317 --> 00:04:14.625
- Guilty.
- Bank robber.

32
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.958
- Couldn't prove it.
- Killed a couple of men.

33
00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.961
- Couldn't prove it.
and I never killed nobody

34
00:04:20.996 --> 00:04:23.337
that wasn't trying to kill me.

35
00:04:31.842 --> 00:04:34.876
When you took me down.
I was sleeping.

36
00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:37.780
It wasn't a real fight.

37
00:04:37.815 --> 00:04:41.388
I just... woke up with a gun
in my face.

38
00:04:41.423 --> 00:04:43.214
- Stay clear of me. Joe.

39
00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:45.854
- You do the same!

40
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.595
Otherwise. most likely.
you're a dead man.

41
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:56.436
- I don't usually tell a man
twice. Stay clear of me. Joe.

42
00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:04.576
- Shit heel.

43
00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:31.801
- Prisoner number 387.
Joe Cribbens.

44
00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:36.905
Your paperwork came
in the afternoon mail.

45
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.907
Tomorrow morning 10 o'clock.

46
00:05:38.942 --> 00:05:41.008
you get your possessions back
and a government check

47
00:05:41.043 --> 00:05:44.110
for 50 dollars.
Good luck to you. Joe.

48
00:05:44.145 --> 00:05:45.452
- Yes. sir.

49
00:05:46.884 --> 00:05:48.081
Yip!

50
00:06:12.107 --> 00:06:13.777
Take a last look.

51
00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:39.638
Captain Brand.
Rider approaching. sir.

52
00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:51.012
Good morning.
Let me take care of your horse.

53
00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:59.790
Max Borlund. follow us.

54
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.131
Sir. Mr. Borlund. sir.

55
00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:12.803
- As you were. corporal.

56
00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:19.678
Mr. Borlund. It's good
to see you again.

57
00:07:19.713 --> 00:07:22.043
It's been some time.
- It has.

58
00:07:22.078 --> 00:07:25.519
- This is Martin Kidd. He could
stand to use your services.

59
00:07:25.554 --> 00:07:27.884
Mr. Kidd is a prominent
businessman here

60
00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:30.381
in the territory.
and a friend to the army.

61
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.155
- Mr. Borlund. it seems your
reputation precedes you.

62
00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.893
- I'll accept that
as a compliment.

63
00:07:36.928 --> 00:07:39.060
- Gentlemen. this is
a clandestine moment

64
00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:41.568
and a meeting
that never happened.

65
00:07:41.603 --> 00:07:44.461
That's why I've convened it out
here in the middle of nowhere.

66
00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:46.903
I'll let you two
get down to business.

67
00:07:46.938 --> 00:07:50.874
- Um. Mr. Borlund. I doubt
that you're familiar

68
00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:53.173
with a Buffalo soldier
by the name of Elijah Jones?

69
00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:54.977
Private Elijah Jones? No?

70
00:07:55.012 --> 00:07:58.376
<i>Right. he's taken a white woman.</i>
<i>my wife. Rachel.</i>

71
00:07:58.411 --> 00:08:00.818
<i>Abducted her three weeks ago.</i>

72
00:08:00.853 --> 00:08:03.249
<i>took her across the border</i>
<i>down to Mexico.</i>

73
00:08:03.284 --> 00:08:06.483
<i>- I sent out patrols.</i>
<i>thought we could head 'em off.</i>

74
00:08:06.518 --> 00:08:09.596
find 'em before they got
to the border. We missed 'em.

75
00:08:09.631 --> 00:08:12.159
- Alright. so. son of a bitch
is asking for $10.000

76
00:08:12.194 --> 00:08:13.996
in ransom money.
which I will not pay.

77
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:17.604
I do not reward criminals.
but I am willing to offer you

78
00:08:17.639 --> 00:08:22.070
$2.000 to bring Rachel back.
$500 advance.

79
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.617
This will help you
identify Rachel.

80
00:08:30.652 --> 00:08:33.587
Captain Brand there
has a document stating

81
00:08:33.622 --> 00:08:36.249
that you are a representative
of the United States government

82
00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:38.625
and you're in pursuit of Elijah.
in case you run into any

83
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.254
legal problems down in Mexico.

84
00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:43.564
- Well. three weeks head
start...

85
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:48.063
I need supplies. a pack mule.
ammunition.

86
00:08:48.098 --> 00:08:51.561
- Discretion in this matter.
that's of paramount importance.

87
00:08:51.596 --> 00:08:54.498
It's my wife's reputation
to consider.

88
00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:57.468
As well as my own.

89
00:08:57.503 --> 00:08:58.678
- Sergeant Poe!

90
00:08:59.947 --> 00:09:02.473
- Off the books. we're sending
one soldier to accompany you.

91
00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:08.314
- Sir! Mr. Borlund.
as ordered by the captain.

92
00:09:08.349 --> 00:09:10.756
Sergeant Alonzo Poe
reporting for duty. sir!

93
00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:14.628
Make sure
he dresses civilian.

94
00:09:14.663 --> 00:09:16.663
Things need to look proper.

95
00:09:16.698 --> 00:09:18.390
Don't want you two
to travel together

96
00:09:18.425 --> 00:09:19.930
until you're both south
of the border.

97
00:09:19.965 --> 00:09:22.526
- Yes. Sergeant.
- Sir. yes. sir!

98
00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:41.853
Well. well. Here comes
the bounty man.

99
00:09:43.318 --> 00:09:45.087
Captain say he the best shooter
in the territory.

100
00:09:45.122 --> 00:09:46.627
rifle or pistol.

101
00:09:59.301 --> 00:10:00.498
- Sergeant Poe.

102
00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:02.566
- Mr. Borlund. sir.

103
00:10:03.877 --> 00:10:06.141
- The captain tells me
you're gonna be a very

104
00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:07.945
valuable man on this trip.

105
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.013
- I just want to say
if things get tight.

106
00:10:10.048 --> 00:10:12.642
I'm a damn good shot.
Best eye in the regiment.

107
00:10:12.677 --> 00:10:15.117
- Captain also says

108
00:10:15.152 --> 00:10:18.791
you have an idea where Mrs. Kidd
and this Elijah Jones may be.

109
00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:21.893
- Oh. I know exactly where.
Got the map right here.

110
00:10:23.094 --> 00:10:24.324
Can't do much better than that.

111
00:10:24.359 --> 00:10:25.556
now can you?

112
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.195
Shows you right to where
they're hiding out.

113
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.526
Now. this here map
was given to me

114
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:29.967
by Private Elijah Jones himself.

115
00:10:30.002 --> 00:10:31.661
- Private Jones
just hands out maps

116
00:10:31.696 --> 00:10:33.872
of where he's gonna be
after he deserts the army

117
00:10:33.907 --> 00:10:36.534
and abducts a white woman?
Let me see this map.

118
00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:49.921
According to this.
they're deep into Chihuahua.

119
00:10:49.956 --> 00:10:52.055
- Mm-hmm.
That sounds about right.

120
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.024
Elijah said it was a fair piece.

121
00:10:54.895 --> 00:10:58.358
- Look. normally we'd head
straight to San Juanito.

122
00:10:58.393 --> 00:11:00.096
It's the best road south.

123
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:03.836
Start asking if anyone's seen
a Black man travelling

124
00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.201
with a white woman.
but if he abducted her.

125
00:11:06.236 --> 00:11:08.335
he'd avoid showing up in cities.

126
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:12.537
- No. He run off.
damn foolish. But...

127
00:11:13.947 --> 00:11:16.046
Well. Elijah didn't
abduct nobody.

128
00:11:17.478 --> 00:11:19.049
- That's not what
I've been told.

129
00:11:20.415 --> 00:11:21.953
- Let me tell you about Elijah.

130
00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:26.188
Like all of God's children.
he's got his faults.

131
00:11:26.223 --> 00:11:28.223
But in a lot of ways.
he's a really good fella.

132
00:11:30.293 --> 00:11:33.800
I know these is delicate
matters. but I gotta say.

133
00:11:33.835 --> 00:11:36.462
if she's with Elijah.
it's 'cause she wanna be.

134
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:38.838
- Sounds like
you're defending him.

135
00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:42.369
- Private Elijah Jones
was expecting me

136
00:11:42.404 --> 00:11:45.174
to join up with him. Gave me
the map so I could find the way.

137
00:11:45.847 --> 00:11:49.079
Now I'm the one who's supposed
to deliver the ransom money.

138
00:11:49.114 --> 00:11:52.214
That's why I truly do believe
they are holed up

139
00:11:52.249 --> 00:11:55.085
in the middle of nowhere
at an American fella's place.

140
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.614
named Hannon.

141
00:11:56.649 --> 00:12:00.123
- There's a Hannon
that's a wanted man in Texas.

142
00:12:00.158 --> 00:12:02.257
The poster's been up
for five years.

143
00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:05.590
Accomplice to murder.
Bank robbery in El Paso.

144
00:12:06.868 --> 00:12:08.329
Do you know this woman?
Mm-hmm.

145
00:12:08.364 --> 00:12:09.759
Ain't never met her.

146
00:12:09.794 --> 00:12:12.300
She helped improve Elijah's
reading in the school.

147
00:12:12.335 --> 00:12:13.873
At least that's what he told me.

148
00:12:14.843 --> 00:12:18.207
- Yeah. is this the face that
launched a thousand ships?

149
00:12:19.441 --> 00:12:21.342
- You wanna run that by me
one more time?

150
00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:24.345
- Ah. it's a line by Marlowe.
Shakespeare's time.

151
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.248
you know. about Helen of Troy.

152
00:12:26.283 --> 00:12:28.283
- All right. right. right. I was
just reading all about that

153
00:12:28.318 --> 00:12:29.350
just the other day.

154
00:12:30.122 --> 00:12:32.485
- You trust that map?
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.927
And they're holed up down there

156
00:12:34.962 --> 00:12:36.489
waiting for the money
that I ain't bringing.

157
00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:43.001
Ooh! Yes. sir! I guess you wanna
know my story too. huh?

158
00:12:43.036 --> 00:12:45.300
- Not necessarily.
- Oh. come on. now. Mr. Borlund.

159
00:12:45.335 --> 00:12:47.104
A little friendly talk
to help the time pass by.

160
00:12:47.139 --> 00:12:48.303
Ain't that true?

161
00:12:48.338 --> 00:12:50.041
- Thanks.
- You want me to call you Max?

162
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:56.674
- I think Mr. Borlund
will do just fine.

163
00:12:57.512 --> 00:12:59.215
- Mr. Borlund it is.

164
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.481
See now. the thing with Elijah
here is real simple.

165
00:13:02.055 --> 00:13:03.351
He wasn't an army man.

166
00:13:04.057 --> 00:13:06.519
See. where I come from.
a new bed.

167
00:13:06.554 --> 00:13:09.863
clean clothes. a good horse.
and three square meals a day

168
00:13:09.898 --> 00:13:11.524
sounded like
a mighty fine deal.

169
00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:13.724
I joined up in the army
when I was 17.

170
00:13:14.694 --> 00:13:17.629
The captain. he filled me in
about you too now. sir.

171
00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:21.303
Captain say you either a
Dutchman. or a Swede. or a...

172
00:13:21.338 --> 00:13:22.832
a German or something such.

173
00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:25.175
Captain say you used to be
a soldier some time way back.

174
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.803
Ain't too sure about
which army. though.

175
00:13:26.838 --> 00:13:28.838
- Mm-hmm.
- Mind telling me?

176
00:13:28.873 --> 00:13:32.380
Is you a Dutchman or a Swede?
Whatever?

177
00:13:32.415 --> 00:13:34.888
- Not at all. I'm an American.

178
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:55.700
- You know. uh...

179
00:13:57.209 --> 00:13:59.374
You've been acting real jumpy
the last few days.

180
00:14:02.742 --> 00:14:04.709
- I've come to realize...

181
00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:09.285
...my whole life. I've done
impulsive things.

182
00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:14.059
They don't always work out.

183
00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:18.228
Got a reserve of 20 bullets.

184
00:14:19.099 --> 00:14:21.165
I'm gonna use another five
to practice.

185
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:24.729
I keep being told this is
a dangerous country.

186
00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:40.019
I'll never give them the
pleasure of watching me cry.

187
00:14:40.318 --> 00:14:43.781
- Good. Yeah. I like that.

188
00:14:44.685 --> 00:14:46.421
We did what we done.

189
00:14:46.456 --> 00:14:48.995
And we just saying
to all of them.

190
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.590
"Piss upon ya.

191
00:14:51.692 --> 00:14:53.263
Go straight to hell."

192
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:11.809
- I was sent here by Tiberio
because my English is good.

193
00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:13.646
Very good. as you can tell.

194
00:15:14.319 --> 00:15:18.519
Let me begin saying I am honored
to meet you. Mrs. Kidd.

195
00:15:18.554 --> 00:15:21.621
Obviously. a very kind and
beautiful woman.

196
00:15:22.624 --> 00:15:25.361
- I say thank you. Mr. Romero.

197
00:15:25.396 --> 00:15:27.330
But maybe you should get
to the point.

198
00:15:28.036 --> 00:15:29.365
Why are you here?

199
00:15:29.862 --> 00:15:32.533
- Oh. I'm here to represent
Tiberio Vargas.

200
00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:35.602
and to give response
to the financial offer

201
00:15:35.637 --> 00:15:37.604
made to him by Señor Hannon.

202
00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:39.177
Let us review the facts.

203
00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:41.476
- We don't have to do
this business here and now.

204
00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:42.873
in front of these people.

205
00:15:43.843 --> 00:15:45.876
- Mr. Hannon owes Tiberio Vargas

206
00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:47.779
several thousand dollars
in gambling debt.

207
00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:52.223
- Hold on. goddamn it!
This is between me and Tiberio.

208
00:15:52.258 --> 00:15:56.359
- To retire the debt. Mr. Hannon
has offered Tiberio Vargas

209
00:15:56.394 --> 00:15:59.956
$5.000 of Mrs. Kidd's
ransom money.

210
00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:03.201
in return for your safe passage
to Veracruz and then Cuba.

211
00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:07.568
- Goddamn it. You son
of a bitch. you sold us out.

212
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:10.043
- All right...

213
00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:12.540
I needed money.

214
00:16:12.575 --> 00:16:16.808
The two of you. you eat up
my food. sleep all hours.

215
00:16:16.843 --> 00:16:18.579
You don't pay shit for rent.

216
00:16:19.285 --> 00:16:23.980
And worst of all. I gotta deal
with this hell cat of yours

217
00:16:24.015 --> 00:16:26.917
complaining all the time
about how dirty it is

218
00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:31.361
for her dainty self and that I
live like a goddamn bindlestiff!

219
00:16:31.396 --> 00:16:33.858
I don't see why I gotta
put up with this shit

220
00:16:33.893 --> 00:16:35.926
from this rich bitch whore

221
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:37.763
without getting paid
royal for it!

222
00:16:45.608 --> 00:16:49.038
I've decided...
the price for room and board

223
00:16:49.073 --> 00:16:52.580
for these two runaways
is $2.500.

224
00:16:53.385 --> 00:16:56.584
Everybody in this deal
is guaranteed something.

225
00:16:57.081 --> 00:16:58.586
Everybody benefits.

226
00:16:59.457 --> 00:17:01.754
- I'll tell you
about guarantees.

227
00:17:01.789 --> 00:17:03.294
I'll guarantee you this.

228
00:17:03.989 --> 00:17:06.759
I am not a whore.

229
00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:32.290
- A message is sent
to Tiberio by Señor Hannon.

230
00:17:32.754 --> 00:17:36.052
His offer proposes that Tiberio.
for $5.000.

231
00:17:36.087 --> 00:17:40.694
will guarantee safe conduct for
you and Mrs. Kidd to Veracruz.

232
00:17:41.796 --> 00:17:43.796
I have come here to
tell you that

233
00:17:43.831 --> 00:17:46.634
Tiberio accepts your proposal.

234
00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:51.936
- Maybe this actually works.

235
00:17:52.642 --> 00:17:56.314
Sure. we lose some money. but...
it gets us a clean getaway.

236
00:18:26.214 --> 00:18:27.510
- Mr. Borlund.

237
00:18:36.323 --> 00:18:39.192
Outlaws?
- Until proven differently.

238
00:18:59.676 --> 00:19:00.708
- Greetings.

239
00:19:02.074 --> 00:19:03.876
This is Señor Tiberio Vargas.

240
00:19:03.911 --> 00:19:06.516
I am Esteban Romero.
at your service.

241
00:19:06.551 --> 00:19:08.320
I will translate.

242
00:19:08.355 --> 00:19:12.225
Señor Vargas is a very important
and generous man.

243
00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.426
Ten years ago. he sent me
to Monterrey to study law.

244
00:19:28.034 --> 00:19:31.002
As you can see.
Tiberio is hunting.

245
00:19:31.037 --> 00:19:32.938
entertaining his guest and
business associate.

246
00:19:32.973 --> 00:19:34.577
Señor Palmer.

247
00:19:34.612 --> 00:19:37.712
Señor Palmer has come
all the way from London

248
00:19:37.747 --> 00:19:39.714
to do business with Tiberio.

249
00:19:39.749 --> 00:19:42.079
- Really?
- Uh. Tiberio says

250
00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:43.916
that the land
you're travelling through.

251
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:46.919
the water you're helping
yourselves to is all his.

252
00:19:46.954 --> 00:19:51.594
and as a result. there is a fee
to be paid for safe passage.

253
00:19:55.061 --> 00:19:56.863
Tiberio is not happy.

254
00:19:56.898 --> 00:19:59.965
He says force
could possibly be used.

255
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.439
He has many guns.

256
00:20:01.903 --> 00:20:04.970
- So do we. Tiberio will be
the first one to be shot.

257
00:20:05.005 --> 00:20:07.973
- If you allow me. sir.
I don't mean to interfere.

258
00:20:08.008 --> 00:20:11.075
but it might not be wise
to contest this issue.

259
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.320
Now. if you want my opinion--
- I don't.

260
00:20:16.654 --> 00:20:19.490
Mr. Poe!
- That'll be me. sir.

261
00:20:19.525 --> 00:20:21.426
Armed and ready.

262
00:20:24.794 --> 00:20:27.729
Down here.
the gringos are not the boss.

263
00:20:27.764 --> 00:20:30.699
- So you do speak English.
- Only when I want.

264
00:20:42.383 --> 00:20:43.679
- Who the hell are you?

265
00:20:44.682 --> 00:20:47.111
- I'm the fella with the gun.
Who the hell is you?

266
00:20:47.146 --> 00:20:49.080
- I go by Jack Tyree.

267
00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:51.214
- Looks like you a long way
from home. Jack.

268
00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:54.217
- I'm giving you advice. amigo.

269
00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:59.332
Clear on out of here. Tiberio
don't kill you. I just might.

270
00:20:59.367 --> 00:21:02.368
I don't much like me some damned
smart mouthed fucker.

271
00:21:09.135 --> 00:21:10.343
- So. what's it gonna be?

272
00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:12.477
How do you want to play it?

273
00:21:29.155 --> 00:21:31.826
Tiberio asks if
you. like so many others.

274
00:21:31.861 --> 00:21:33.663
are here to seek gold.

275
00:21:33.698 --> 00:21:35.533
- We all work for money.

276
00:21:43.543 --> 00:21:46.907
Well. sir.
my name is William Palmer.

277
00:21:47.338 --> 00:21:49.415
I just wish to say that
your good fortune matches

278
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.043
your obstinate stupidity.

279
00:21:51.584 --> 00:21:53.551
<i>- Vamos. vamos!</i>
- Good day.

280
00:21:54.422 --> 00:21:55.586
Yah!

281
00:21:58.426 --> 00:22:01.394
- You find gold.
you must share it with Tiberio.

282
00:22:02.023 --> 00:22:04.760
Otherwise. I guarantee
the consequences will be

283
00:22:04.795 --> 00:22:06.630
extremely unpleasant.

284
00:22:22.241 --> 00:22:24.417
- I don't think we made
a new friend.

285
00:23:01.588 --> 00:23:03.654
Do you wish
for a meal or a room?

286
00:23:03.689 --> 00:23:05.117
- I reckon I need both.

287
00:23:05.152 --> 00:23:07.383
- Ah. How long are you
gonna stay. Señor?

288
00:23:07.418 --> 00:23:10.595
- Ah. a couple of weeks.
Maybe more.<i> quién sabe.</i>

289
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.762
- Ah. we've got lots of rooms.

290
00:23:15.866 --> 00:23:17.503
I give you
the best one.

291
00:23:18.198 --> 00:23:20.396
- Looks to be kind of quiet
around here.

292
00:23:20.431 --> 00:23:21.936
- You know. we have this town.

293
00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:23.971
People still come here
to gamble.

294
00:23:24.512 --> 00:23:26.677
Tiberio Vargas
y<i> sus hombres.</i>

295
00:23:26.712 --> 00:23:28.580
they come here. they gamble.

296
00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:31.407
We still have<i> rucas.</i>
<i>Buenas rucas.</i>

297
00:23:31.442 --> 00:23:34.487
We have the house dealer.
Sylvio. an honest man.

298
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:37.985
- Right now. that's just
what the doctor ordered.

299
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.460
Gonna suit me right down
to the ground.

300
00:23:41.155 --> 00:23:43.595
Joe Cribbens.
at your service.

301
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.356
-<i> Entonces...</i> What.
you are a businessman?

302
00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:51.031
- I retired. I just like
to play cards and...

303
00:23:51.066 --> 00:23:52.670
stay out of trouble.

304
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:11.821
- See them two horses down
there? Them is army horses.

305
00:24:12.516 --> 00:24:13.757
The map worked out.

306
00:24:14.661 --> 00:24:16.287
We got 'em. Mr. Borlund.

307
00:24:16.322 --> 00:24:18.223
We got 'em with the element
of surprise.

308
00:24:19.864 --> 00:24:24.229
- The map was correct.
Very good. Mr. Poe. Very good.

309
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.572
- I aim to please.

310
00:24:58.639 --> 00:25:01.772
- Don't seem
to be any luck. Shit.

311
00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.369
- You got a bad temper. Jack.

312
00:25:06.273 --> 00:25:09.208
The other night.
you were way out of hand.

313
00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:13.443
You oughta get it under control.

314
00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:16.281
I still can't accept--

315
00:25:22.091 --> 00:25:25.290
- Elijah. don't!
I wouldn't try anything foolish.

316
00:25:25.325 --> 00:25:26.797
Walk away from that gun.

317
00:25:26.832 --> 00:25:29.228
No. no. no. no!
This ain't part of the deal!

318
00:25:29.263 --> 00:25:30.636
This is my private fucking--

319
00:25:30.671 --> 00:25:33.397
- Oh. Mr. Hannon. keep
your arms up and stay quiet!

320
00:25:33.432 --> 00:25:34.904
- Who are you?
- Go easy now. ma'am.

321
00:25:34.939 --> 00:25:37.203
a lot of guns in here.
- Damn you. I asked who are you.

322
00:25:37.238 --> 00:25:38.567
Just what do you think
you're doing?

323
00:25:38.602 --> 00:25:40.206
- We're here on full legal
authority. Mrs. Kidd.

324
00:25:40.241 --> 00:25:42.109
- That. and me and Elijah here
are old friends.

325
00:25:42.144 --> 00:25:44.947
- Alonzo. you done gone over.
you done sold me out?

326
00:25:44.982 --> 00:25:47.818
- Yep! Turns out I'm just a good
old army man. ain't that right?

327
00:25:47.853 --> 00:25:49.886
- You're the only damn person
in the regiment I trusted!

328
00:25:49.921 --> 00:25:52.086
You let me down. brother!
- You let yourself down

329
00:25:52.121 --> 00:25:54.220
with this dumbass plan.
That and getting caught up

330
00:25:54.255 --> 00:25:55.793
with this silly-ass white woman.

331
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.631
- One thing is for certain.
I ain't going back to Texas

332
00:25:58.666 --> 00:26:00.490
with some bounty man!

333
00:26:01.768 --> 00:26:03.163
I got a rope waiting for me.

334
00:26:03.198 --> 00:26:05.495
Get the hell gone
or I'll kill her. sure as hell!

335
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.299
- He's not after you.
he's after us.

336
00:26:07.334 --> 00:26:08.564
- Bullshit!
- Goddamn--

337
00:26:23.647 --> 00:26:24.723
- You killed him.

338
00:26:25.154 --> 00:26:26.285
- Yes. I did.

339
00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:29.453
You're gonna bury him.
Mr. Jones.

340
00:26:31.699 --> 00:26:33.897
Max Borlund. Ma'am.

341
00:26:35.329 --> 00:26:38.033
I've been hired by your husband
to take you home.

342
00:27:04.259 --> 00:27:06.193
- You see the mess
you done got yourself in?

343
00:27:06.734 --> 00:27:09.031
You ain't nothing
but a damn stupid fool.

344
00:27:18.944 --> 00:27:21.208
- I'm not grateful
for your mission here.

345
00:27:22.112 --> 00:27:25.179
But I should thank you
for possibly saving my life.

346
00:27:26.116 --> 00:27:27.984
- Hannon was a foolish man.

347
00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:30.349
- Mr. Hannon was
a treacherous man.

348
00:27:32.122 --> 00:27:33.891
- Get yourself together.
Mrs. Kidd.

349
00:27:33.926 --> 00:27:36.454
and whatever you need.
we ride within the hour.

350
00:27:38.458 --> 00:27:41.096
- I suppose I need
to surrender my gun.

351
00:27:41.131 --> 00:27:43.593
I keep a derringer in my valise.

352
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.876
I'm doing this because
Elijah might

353
00:27:51.911 --> 00:27:53.944
try to do something foolish.

354
00:27:54.705 --> 00:27:56.276
I wouldn't want
to see him killed.

355
00:27:57.642 --> 00:27:59.675
I'd feel more than
partially responsible

356
00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:01.248
if he came to any harm.

357
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:05.417
- Deserted the army.
attempted extortion.

358
00:28:05.452 --> 00:28:07.221
He's coming in
for a lot of harm.

359
00:28:07.718 --> 00:28:10.719
- Maybe the easiest way out
of this mess is to shoot you.

360
00:28:10.754 --> 00:28:13.095
And solve at least
some of my problems.

361
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:16.296
- I don't think that's such
a good idea. Mrs. Kidd.

362
00:28:27.276 --> 00:28:30.508
- Mr. Borlund.
I have a question.

363
00:28:32.776 --> 00:28:36.085
Are you under the impression
that you are rescuing me?

364
00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:38.153
- I was told
that you were abducted.

365
00:28:38.782 --> 00:28:40.254
- That was a lie.

366
00:28:40.289 --> 00:28:43.257
- I've also been told that
by Sergeant Poe.

367
00:29:30.801 --> 00:29:33.373
- When you killed Mr. Hannon
back at his cabin...

368
00:29:33.408 --> 00:29:34.308
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:38.279
- Your bullets missed
my head by inches.

370
00:29:38.314 --> 00:29:39.379
- Mm-hmm.

371
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.482
- You're that confident
in your marksmanship?

372
00:29:44.188 --> 00:29:45.154
- No.

373
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:51.259
- Thought you was my friend.

374
00:29:52.856 --> 00:29:54.757
You went and turned
your back on me.

375
00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:01.566
- Now. you listen
to me. brother.

376
00:30:02.404 --> 00:30:03.766
This thing ain't over yet.

377
00:30:04.868 --> 00:30:06.802
I might just be able
to get you out of this mess

378
00:30:06.837 --> 00:30:08.177
you done put yourself in.

379
00:30:09.444 --> 00:30:10.916
Oh. and let me say this.

380
00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:14.249
I still think it's a good idea
you and the army is finished.

381
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.384
You wasn't exactly
the soldier type of fella.

382
00:30:18.552 --> 00:30:20.684
I go along with the notion
seeing it's a real good idea

383
00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:23.456
that you end up in Cuba
some such. You hear me?

384
00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:26.932
- Maybe you oughta hear this.

385
00:30:27.693 --> 00:30:29.935
I got me and Rachel
an insurance policy.

386
00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:32.267
His name is Tiberio.

387
00:30:34.634 --> 00:30:36.106
- You know I'm married.

388
00:30:38.077 --> 00:30:40.737
Certainly. you know I've run off
with a man of color.

389
00:30:41.641 --> 00:30:44.642
I expect you think you have me
pretty well figured out.

390
00:30:48.582 --> 00:30:52.023
- Your husband hired me to take
you back across the border.

391
00:30:52.058 --> 00:30:54.322
Beyond that.
I have no opinion.

392
00:30:55.292 --> 00:30:57.787
- Martin Kidd is not simply
a bad husband.

393
00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.999
He's also a very bad man.

394
00:31:03.102 --> 00:31:05.399
- Not everyone I work for
is a saint.

395
00:31:06.666 --> 00:31:09.568
I took a job and I intend
to earn my money.

396
00:31:10.978 --> 00:31:12.769
- You live by a code?

397
00:31:13.244 --> 00:31:14.375
- I try.

398
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.080
- You ever question it?

399
00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:18.082
- Not often.

400
00:31:19.283 --> 00:31:20.777
- Got a wife?

401
00:31:27.258 --> 00:31:29.819
- I don't think I'm a good fit
for the whole idea.

402
00:31:29.854 --> 00:31:30.963
- Yeah. well...

403
00:31:31.922 --> 00:31:33.757
- Excuse me. I gotta see
Mr. Poe.

404
00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:46.803
Go get something to eat.
I'll relieve you.

405
00:31:47.443 --> 00:31:49.575
You can spell me
in four hours. I'll wake you.

406
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:52.116
- I got some information
about Elijah.

407
00:31:52.151 --> 00:31:53.645
The goddamn fool done made
some type of deal

408
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.954
with that Tiberio fella.

409
00:31:56.386 --> 00:31:58.716
- Does... Does Mrs. Kidd
know that?

410
00:31:59.389 --> 00:32:02.126
- I don't know for sure.
but I expect so.

411
00:32:10.466 --> 00:32:12.301
- Very interesting game. poker.

412
00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:14.666
Sometimes. it's hard to figure

413
00:32:14.701 --> 00:32:18.274
when the man's bluffing
or when he's got the goods.

414
00:32:18.309 --> 00:32:20.309
So far.
you seem to be on your game.

415
00:32:24.348 --> 00:32:25.710
You know. I like to know

416
00:32:25.745 --> 00:32:27.613
the name of the people
I play cards with. That way.

417
00:32:27.648 --> 00:32:29.153
when they take my money.
it makes it that little

418
00:32:29.188 --> 00:32:30.517
bit more friendly.

419
00:32:30.552 --> 00:32:32.552
- You played here
for an hour and a half.

420
00:32:32.587 --> 00:32:34.719
and not knowing my name
didn't seem to bother you

421
00:32:34.754 --> 00:32:36.061
until I started winning.

422
00:32:36.096 --> 00:32:37.788
- Well. you do show some signs

423
00:32:37.823 --> 00:32:39.361
of being a professional
card shark.

424
00:32:39.396 --> 00:32:40.923
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

425
00:32:41.761 --> 00:32:44.696
- I'll take that
as a sign of respect.

426
00:32:44.731 --> 00:32:46.698
- Well. it wasn't meant
in that spirit.

427
00:32:46.733 --> 00:32:48.370
Now. I'd like to have a name.

428
00:32:48.405 --> 00:32:49.899
unless it's something
you're ashamed of.

429
00:32:49.934 --> 00:32:51.670
One card.

430
00:32:51.705 --> 00:32:52.935
- Sure thing. amigo.

431
00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:57.049
But I want to be real polite.

432
00:32:57.084 --> 00:32:58.347
You first.

433
00:32:58.844 --> 00:33:01.911
- With pleasure.
William Palmer Esquire.

434
00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:03.220
firm purchase agent for the

435
00:33:03.255 --> 00:33:05.013
Turnbull Mining
Properties Limited.

436
00:33:05.048 --> 00:33:07.257
Offices in London. Manchester.
and New Orleans.

437
00:33:07.292 --> 00:33:10.029
Around here. they refer to me
as Guillermo Inglés.

438
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.494
- English Bill.
Long way from home.

439
00:33:13.529 --> 00:33:14.627
- Indeed.

440
00:33:16.433 --> 00:33:17.630
And you are?

441
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.568
- Joe Cribbens. I'm from Texas.

442
00:33:24.705 --> 00:33:29.114
You seem to be a man of strong
opinions. English Bill.

443
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:31.545
- Mr. Palmer. if you please.

444
00:33:32.042 --> 00:33:34.251
Now. let me put you on notice.
Mr. Cribbens.

445
00:33:34.286 --> 00:33:36.044
I'm a very. very good
card player.

446
00:33:36.079 --> 00:33:38.552
I do not intend to be taken in
by any tricks of your trade

447
00:33:38.587 --> 00:33:41.093
because I am not a man
to be taken advantage of.

448
00:33:41.128 --> 00:33:44.096
I can defend myself adequately
here in this rough terrain.

449
00:33:44.131 --> 00:33:46.263
I'm also here on business
with Mr. Tiberio Vargas.

450
00:33:46.298 --> 00:33:47.693
who. as you must certainly know.

451
00:33:47.728 --> 00:33:49.662
is lord of all he surveys
in these parts.

452
00:33:50.764 --> 00:33:56.031
- Now. since I think you're just
another bullshit Englishman.

453
00:33:56.066 --> 00:33:58.638
the kind of fella
we gringos have already

454
00:33:58.673 --> 00:34:00.805
whipped twice in two wars...

455
00:34:02.281 --> 00:34:04.611
Why don't we cut the blabber

456
00:34:04.646 --> 00:34:07.185
and just concentrate
on playing cards?

457
00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:13.455
Well. hell!

458
00:34:14.084 --> 00:34:18.757
English Bill. Your luck's bound
to change sometime.

459
00:34:19.298 --> 00:34:21.628
So. I guess I'll call.

460
00:34:22.367 --> 00:34:25.027
With... two itty-bitty pairs.

461
00:34:28.131 --> 00:34:29.471
- Son of a bitch.

462
00:34:29.506 --> 00:34:31.605
- Some fellas just can't get
away with a bluff.

463
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.607
They lack the character for it.

464
00:34:33.642 --> 00:34:34.740
- I'll tell you this
Mr. Cribbens.

465
00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:36.313
you're damn lucky
I'm not wearing a gun.

466
00:34:36.348 --> 00:34:38.150
- And I'll tell you this.
English Bill.

467
00:34:38.185 --> 00:34:40.416
You're damn lucky
I don't put a bullet up your ass

468
00:34:40.451 --> 00:34:42.110
just on general principle.

469
00:34:42.145 --> 00:34:47.082
Now. if I was you.
I'd get out of my sight.

470
00:34:47.117 --> 00:34:49.557
before I run through
all my good humor.

471
00:36:01.268 --> 00:36:03.862
I have
a fugitive of the law.

472
00:36:03.897 --> 00:36:07.206
army deserter and extortionist.

473
00:36:11.377 --> 00:36:15.610
I am Max Borlund representing
the United States army.

474
00:36:15.645 --> 00:36:18.041
- And I am Captain
Miguel Aragon.

475
00:36:18.076 --> 00:36:20.076
Chief Magistrate
of Trinidad Maria.

476
00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:21.550
- At your service.

477
00:36:21.585 --> 00:36:24.113
- Who's the woman?
- I have a name.

478
00:36:25.248 --> 00:36:27.259
Mrs. Rachel Kidd.

479
00:36:27.294 --> 00:36:30.427
- You can put the prisoner
in a cell and send a telegram

480
00:36:30.462 --> 00:36:33.188
to the territorial deputy
in Santa Fe saying that you have

481
00:36:33.223 --> 00:36:36.092
a Private Elijah Jones
in your custody.

482
00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:38.402
- You have no jurisdiction here.

483
00:36:38.437 --> 00:36:40.734
- Yes. But your country's law

484
00:36:40.769 --> 00:36:42.967
doesn't permit deserters
of foreign armies

485
00:36:43.002 --> 00:36:44.738
to find safe haven.

486
00:36:44.773 --> 00:36:48.137
There's an honorable tradition
of extraditing men

487
00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:49.809
who come here
with bad intentions.

488
00:36:49.844 --> 00:36:51.415
- Maybe you oughta
hear this. Captain.

489
00:36:51.846 --> 00:36:55.419
You lock me up. Tiberio Vargas
might not like it one damn bit.

490
00:36:55.454 --> 00:36:57.047
- Tiberio Vargas?
- Uh-huh. Me and him

491
00:36:57.082 --> 00:36:59.984
were talking business before
this bounty man showed up.

492
00:37:00.657 --> 00:37:04.153
By the way. he killed a man.
Jack Hannon.

493
00:37:08.467 --> 00:37:10.302
- You killed a man?
- Yeah.

494
00:37:11.261 --> 00:37:15.230
American. Wanted criminal
who resisted arrest.

495
00:37:15.265 --> 00:37:17.540
They're witnesses.
- Yes.

496
00:37:18.708 --> 00:37:22.039
Mr. Borlund killed Mr. Hannon
after he put a gun to my head.

497
00:37:22.712 --> 00:37:25.482
Mr. Borlund probably
saved my life.

498
00:37:32.117 --> 00:37:33.952
We are officers
of the law.

499
00:37:35.054 --> 00:37:36.328
We will lock him up.

500
00:37:46.637 --> 00:37:48.604
- Can't say I didn't do nothing
for you. brother.

501
00:37:50.575 --> 00:37:52.542
- Yeah. real goddamn funny.

502
00:37:52.577 --> 00:37:54.379
- Well. I'll check in on you
every now and then.

503
00:37:54.414 --> 00:37:55.875
make sure they're
feeding you proper.

504
00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:05.181
- Mr. Borlund.
a word in private.

505
00:38:18.537 --> 00:38:20.768
- I'm sorry. Elijah.

506
00:38:22.002 --> 00:38:23.903
None of this
is turning out right.

507
00:38:24.444 --> 00:38:27.544
- Yeah. Gotta admit.

508
00:38:27.579 --> 00:38:30.107
Cuba's looking real far away.

509
00:38:33.948 --> 00:38:36.916
- My government expects me
to protect lives and property.

510
00:38:36.951 --> 00:38:39.215
If Tiberio Vargas becomes angry.

511
00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.349
or attempts to profit
from this situation.

512
00:38:41.384 --> 00:38:42.889
there could be trouble.

513
00:38:42.924 --> 00:38:45.595
This town is under
my jurisdiction.

514
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:48.290
but out there.
Tiberio is king.

515
00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:51.865
There are those who come here
and then break the law.

516
00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:53.735
Two gringos.

517
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.265
They were robbing local farmers.
hiding up in the mountains.

518
00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.872
Tiberio and his men
hunted them down.

519
00:38:58.907 --> 00:39:01.369
I let them hang
for two weeks after that.

520
00:39:01.404 --> 00:39:03.272
The smell gets very bad.

521
00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:05.109
- Did you give them a trial?

522
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:08.585
- It wasn't necessary.

523
00:39:16.122 --> 00:39:19.090
You should go over to the
hotel and get yourself a room.

524
00:39:21.765 --> 00:39:25.602
- Unfortunately. I am without
sufficient funds.

525
00:39:25.637 --> 00:39:27.032
- Yeah. I'll take care of that

526
00:39:27.067 --> 00:39:29.166
after I send a telegram
to your husband.

527
00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.273
See all this mess
you done caused?

528
00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:39.374
Runaway woman.

529
00:39:39.409 --> 00:39:42.784
bounty hunter.
price on your head...

530
00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:46.755
And believe me. for sure.
they'd rather see you dead.

531
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.955
- Guess I was better off
in the army all those years

532
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:50.627
taking nothing but shit.

533
00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:53.322
And knowing if I quit the army.

534
00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:56.567
I ain't got much chance
of doing nothing else.

535
00:39:56.602 --> 00:39:59.262
Except shining shoes
or serving food.

536
00:40:00.672 --> 00:40:02.199
Well no. sir.

537
00:40:03.433 --> 00:40:05.004
No thank you.

538
00:40:47.752 --> 00:40:49.213
Do you speak English?

539
00:40:49.248 --> 00:40:50.555
- I do. Señor.

540
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.524
- Mrs. Kidd will need a room

541
00:40:52.559 --> 00:40:56.528
for a few days. maybe more.
I need a room as well.

542
00:40:57.993 --> 00:41:00.796
- Number four. at the top
of those stairs.

543
00:41:00.831 --> 00:41:02.325
- Thank you.

544
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.229
- You have number two.
across the hallway.

545
00:41:05.264 --> 00:41:07.264
- Thanks.
- Señor.

546
00:41:11.941 --> 00:41:14.238
- I suppose I should say
thank you.

547
00:41:14.273 --> 00:41:16.746
but then I remember
who you're working for.

548
00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:20.244
It doesn't seem right.

549
00:41:20.279 --> 00:41:22.378
Elijah being treated
like a criminal.

550
00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:24.182
and I'm put up in a nice hotel.

551
00:41:25.625 --> 00:41:28.593
- Elijah left the army.
that makes him a deserter.

552
00:41:28.628 --> 00:41:32.223
You left your marriage.
No one goes to jail for that.

553
00:41:54.214 --> 00:41:56.445
- Ah. there he is.

554
00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.416
Joe Cribbens.
Professional card shark.

555
00:42:01.793 --> 00:42:03.628
See. I've been considering
our card game.

556
00:42:03.663 --> 00:42:05.190
and I believe you cheated me.

557
00:42:05.225 --> 00:42:07.962
- I don't need to cheat
to beat you. amigo.

558
00:42:07.997 --> 00:42:10.965
- Well. this time. I brought
my service revolver

559
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.364
and I fully intend on dealing
with the situation.

560
00:42:14.399 --> 00:42:17.367
Now. I suggest you give me
back my money

561
00:42:17.402 --> 00:42:20.073
and throw in a few extra
shillings for good measure.

562
00:42:33.187 --> 00:42:37.453
- Goddamn Englishman
went and committed suicide.

563
00:42:57.508 --> 00:42:59.376
- Esperanza. you can come in.

564
00:43:01.182 --> 00:43:02.951
- I thought I picked...
Oh. I'm sorry.

565
00:43:02.986 --> 00:43:04.986
- No. come in.
- What I wanted to discuss--

566
00:43:05.021 --> 00:43:06.548
- I said come in.

567
00:43:11.698 --> 00:43:14.523
As you can see. I'm trying
to take a bath.

568
00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:16.701
My first real one in weeks.

569
00:43:19.805 --> 00:43:21.530
What's the matter?

570
00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:23.004
You suspect I'm a whore.

571
00:43:23.039 --> 00:43:24.874
I supposed I might
as well act like one.

572
00:43:27.307 --> 00:43:28.845
Are you getting nervous?

573
00:43:30.244 --> 00:43:32.849
Maybe. like most men.

574
00:43:32.884 --> 00:43:37.051
you're just scared to death of
really dealing with a woman.

575
00:43:37.086 --> 00:43:38.723
- Are you finished?

576
00:43:41.893 --> 00:43:44.190
I came to let you know
that tomorrow

577
00:43:44.225 --> 00:43:46.225
I'll start making arrangements

578
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:48.326
to have you taken back
across the border.

579
00:43:50.396 --> 00:43:52.561
- My life is done there.

580
00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:55.135
I have to move on. not go back.

581
00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:57.500
I appreciate your concern.

582
00:43:57.535 --> 00:43:59.502
but I will be the one
to figure out my life.

583
00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:02.043
- Mm-hmm.

584
00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:06.718
You refuse to go?

585
00:44:06.753 --> 00:44:08.852
- I refuse to go.

586
00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:11.723
Even at gun point.

587
00:44:15.058 --> 00:44:18.290
If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

588
00:44:25.365 --> 00:44:26.595
As you have been told.

589
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.498
I'm here representing
Tiberio Vargas.

590
00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:31.270
He has already heard about this
unfortunate incident.

591
00:44:31.305 --> 00:44:34.603
- Look. this man tried
to kill me. came here to do it.

592
00:44:34.638 --> 00:44:37.749
Most likely a real shit heel
in general.

593
00:44:37.784 --> 00:44:40.180
I figured I was doing
everybody a favor.

594
00:44:40.215 --> 00:44:43.755
- We need no favors.
but possibly you do.

595
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.417
This man you killed
was doing serious business

596
00:44:46.452 --> 00:44:47.715
with Tiberio Vargas.

597
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:50.256
- Tiberio Vargas.
I keep hearing the name.

598
00:44:50.291 --> 00:44:52.896
- Mmm. you do not want him
for an enemy.

599
00:45:02.974 --> 00:45:04.435
- Joe Cribbens.

600
00:45:06.472 --> 00:45:10.507
Name's not Joseph.
Just Joe will cover the deal.

601
00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.246
I was Texas. born and bred.

602
00:45:13.281 --> 00:45:15.743
Been knocking around
since I was 15.

603
00:45:15.778 --> 00:45:18.053
Worked Teamster. worked Trooper.

604
00:45:18.088 --> 00:45:19.791
Drifted some.

605
00:45:19.826 --> 00:45:21.859
I always liked playing cards.

606
00:45:23.258 --> 00:45:26.193
- Tell me why you shot
this Englishman.

607
00:45:27.966 --> 00:45:30.758
- I beat him at cards.
I beat him fair and square.

608
00:45:30.793 --> 00:45:32.595
He didn't take it too good.

609
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.268
Guess I just turned out
to be the better man.

610
00:45:35.303 --> 00:45:38.436
- Luis agrees the Englishman
shot first.

611
00:45:38.471 --> 00:45:43.441
He's an honest man.
Tiberio will consider all this.

612
00:45:43.476 --> 00:45:45.311
You must wait here in Guadalupe

613
00:45:45.346 --> 00:45:47.643
while Tiberio makes
his decision.

614
00:45:48.514 --> 00:45:51.713
- Damn. My luck's run bad.

615
00:46:52.182 --> 00:46:55.546
- Mr. Borlund. We meet again.

616
00:46:55.581 --> 00:46:58.923
This time. I'm happy to say
I'm not sitting in a bathtub.

617
00:46:58.958 --> 00:47:00.749
Do you have news?

618
00:47:00.784 --> 00:47:03.092
- I was just informed
a few minutes ago

619
00:47:03.127 --> 00:47:06.524
by Captain Aragon that
your husband is on his way here.

620
00:47:06.559 --> 00:47:08.427
he's travelling by coach.

621
00:47:08.462 --> 00:47:11.870
I am to watch over you
until he arrives.

622
00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:20.802
- A very bad situation
now made worse.

623
00:47:26.744 --> 00:47:28.381
The last time we talked.

624
00:47:28.416 --> 00:47:31.087
I was extremely short-tempered.
I apologize.

625
00:47:31.122 --> 00:47:32.748
- No apology necessary.

626
00:47:32.783 --> 00:47:37.456
- I've decided you need to be in
greater possession of the facts.

627
00:47:37.491 --> 00:47:39.722
I believe you need
to know my story.

628
00:47:40.758 --> 00:47:44.034
It begins with
a well-off family.

629
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:46.696
I'm the youngest
of three sisters.

630
00:47:46.731 --> 00:47:49.138
educated by a series
of governesses.

631
00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:53.208
Rebellious. Didn't get along
with anybody much.

632
00:47:53.243 --> 00:47:55.639
including my parents
and my sisters.

633
00:47:56.939 --> 00:48:01.249
Fell in love at 17.
It was quite passionate.

634
00:48:02.516 --> 00:48:06.089
I've always resisted
traditional morality.

635
00:48:08.126 --> 00:48:11.160
My mother once told me.
"You only fall completely

636
00:48:11.195 --> 00:48:15.329
in love once. and usually.
when you're very young."

637
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:19.762
She also told me.
"Almost no woman ends up

638
00:48:19.797 --> 00:48:21.302
with her first choice."

639
00:48:21.337 --> 00:48:24.206
Five years later.
I met Martin Kidd.

640
00:48:25.473 --> 00:48:28.606
He was charming. ambitious.

641
00:48:28.641 --> 00:48:31.708
seemed very rich.
and he was from the west.

642
00:48:32.975 --> 00:48:36.020
I desperately wanted to get away
from where I grew up.

643
00:48:36.055 --> 00:48:39.254
We had a quick romance. and four
weeks later. we were married.

644
00:48:39.289 --> 00:48:41.355
We went to live
in his home in Santa Fe.

645
00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:46.063
Then. the horror started.

646
00:48:47.528 --> 00:48:50.133
I discovered he's a crook.

647
00:48:50.168 --> 00:48:55.303
a conniver. an extortionist.
a land cheat.

648
00:48:55.338 --> 00:48:57.503
He constantly consorted
with other women.

649
00:48:57.538 --> 00:48:59.208
usually prostitutes.

650
00:48:59.243 --> 00:49:03.212
I was reduced to being
that which I most despise.

651
00:49:03.247 --> 00:49:05.577
a decoration wife.

652
00:49:07.251 --> 00:49:12.320
To my shame. I took all of it
and more for five years.

653
00:49:13.587 --> 00:49:16.225
There were endless fights
with Martin.

654
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:20.889
Finally. he condescendingly
allowed me to start a school.

655
00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:25.069
I taught those who had very
little advantage in life. and...

656
00:49:27.568 --> 00:49:30.074
And as time passed.
I eventually became

657
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:33.506
more than a teacher
with one of my students.

658
00:49:33.541 --> 00:49:35.343
- Elijah Jones.

659
00:49:37.611 --> 00:49:39.083
- Elijah Jones.

660
00:49:40.086 --> 00:49:43.010
He had his own set of problems.

661
00:49:43.045 --> 00:49:46.849
I was sympathetic.
One thing led to another.

662
00:49:46.884 --> 00:49:50.325
Eventually. we realized escape
was our only recourse.

663
00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.624
So we made a plan to run off.

664
00:49:53.396 --> 00:49:54.791
And did.

665
00:49:57.103 --> 00:49:58.634
I suppose you know the rest.

666
00:50:01.701 --> 00:50:03.470
He's a good person.

667
00:50:04.275 --> 00:50:07.672
And often. a great comfort to
me. but we are very different.

668
00:50:07.707 --> 00:50:09.542
We have no future together.

669
00:50:10.776 --> 00:50:13.381
We've had some good times.
but eventually.

670
00:50:13.416 --> 00:50:16.010
we will go our separate ways.
We both know it.

671
00:50:16.045 --> 00:50:17.946
Probably sooner than later.

672
00:50:19.488 --> 00:50:22.390
If I'm being completely honest.

673
00:50:22.425 --> 00:50:26.229
Elijah was not the first
of my romantic adventures

674
00:50:26.264 --> 00:50:27.923
since I married Martin.

675
00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:31.465
Most were in simple retaliation.

676
00:50:35.504 --> 00:50:37.735
Well. I think I've done
enough confessing.

677
00:50:40.509 --> 00:50:43.840
I want you to think of me
as an honest person.

678
00:50:44.843 --> 00:50:46.744
However. imperfect.

679
00:50:46.779 --> 00:50:48.911
I want you to think of me
as an honest person.

680
00:50:48.946 --> 00:50:51.122
because I believe
that matters to you.

681
00:50:51.157 --> 00:50:55.126
I just want to say this.
for the record.

682
00:50:57.922 --> 00:51:02.925
When my husband gets here.
he intends to kill me.

683
00:51:14.807 --> 00:51:16.741
- I know you heard
Mrs. Kidd and the others

684
00:51:16.776 --> 00:51:17.973
can't come visit you.

685
00:51:19.614 --> 00:51:21.977
- Anybody bother
giving a reason?

686
00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:24.078
Just when we're kicking
the balls for Elijah.

687
00:51:24.113 --> 00:51:27.818
- Captain Aragon said the bounty
man and me has jurisdiction.

688
00:51:27.853 --> 00:51:30.194
Ain't nobody else allowed.
- Yeah.

689
00:51:31.329 --> 00:51:33.263
Just one more kick
in the balls. huh.

690
00:51:33.298 --> 00:51:35.364
- Quit feeling sorry
for yourself.

691
00:51:35.399 --> 00:51:36.959
It don't help a damn thing.

692
00:51:37.863 --> 00:51:40.798
And you know Mr. Kidd himself
is on the way up here right now.

693
00:51:42.472 --> 00:51:44.175
- Yeah.

694
00:51:44.804 --> 00:51:46.210
Oh yeah. I heard.

695
00:51:46.806 --> 00:51:49.180
Captain Aragon told me.

696
00:51:49.215 --> 00:51:51.644
You know. I just figure
he's bringing the ransom money

697
00:51:51.679 --> 00:51:53.712
in a... personal way.

698
00:51:53.747 --> 00:51:56.187
- More likely he coming up
to settle things with you.

699
00:51:56.222 --> 00:51:58.145
Now. I gotta figure out a way
how I'm a bust you up

700
00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.389
out of here and get you on your
way to some half-ass freedom.

701
00:52:01.018 --> 00:52:02.358
Now first...

702
00:52:02.756 --> 00:52:04.327
And you gotta do this...

703
00:52:06.155 --> 00:52:07.990
Forget this white woman.

704
00:52:08.432 --> 00:52:09.827
You travelling with her.
you get spotted

705
00:52:09.862 --> 00:52:11.895
real easy and you finished.

706
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.370
Plus. I gotta figure out a way
how I'm gonna stay clean.

707
00:52:14.405 --> 00:52:16.130
Because I plans to be
going back home.

708
00:52:16.165 --> 00:52:18.033
-and I'm going back to the army.
- That's what it is.

709
00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:20.244
Don't let nothing interfere
with what's good for Alonzo Poe.

710
00:52:20.279 --> 00:52:21.575
- You goddamn right!

711
00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:22.906
Because I sure as shit
ain't finna go

712
00:52:22.941 --> 00:52:24.413
outlaw for a dumbass like you.

713
00:52:24.448 --> 00:52:26.382
You've already caused me
enough grief.

714
00:52:28.518 --> 00:52:30.848
Now. keep your mouth shut.
keep your eyes open.

715
00:52:30.883 --> 00:52:32.916
and boy. you better pray...

716
00:52:32.951 --> 00:52:35.050
that I can do you
some real good.

717
00:52:46.701 --> 00:52:48.437
Mr. Borlund.

718
00:52:48.472 --> 00:52:50.439
I figured I'd take
the horses out for exercise.

719
00:52:50.474 --> 00:52:52.771
Wanna keep 'em fit.

720
00:52:52.806 --> 00:52:54.707
- Very good. Mr. Poe.

721
00:52:54.742 --> 00:52:56.313
- Yes. sir.

722
00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:00.548
Boots and saddle. slap leather
and ride.

723
00:53:00.583 --> 00:53:01.615
That's our motto.

724
00:53:02.816 --> 00:53:05.718
I'm a cavalry man.
So I sticks to it.

725
00:53:07.249 --> 00:53:09.227
- Sergeant Poe.
- Yes. sir.

726
00:53:10.824 --> 00:53:13.264
- With the prisoner
Elijah Jones...

727
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:15.398
- Yes. sir.

728
00:53:15.961 --> 00:53:17.532
- Don't do anything stupid

729
00:53:17.567 --> 00:53:20.095
like try to break him out
of jail and set him free.

730
00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:22.240
- Yes. sir.

731
00:53:23.001 --> 00:53:24.407
Why would you think that?

732
00:53:24.442 --> 00:53:25.705
- Because you're not as clever

733
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.070
and I'm not as stupid
as you imagine.

734
00:53:30.481 --> 00:53:33.482
- Yes. sir. I mean... No. sir.

735
00:53:39.281 --> 00:53:42.260
- The time to do it
is when step back to the border.

736
00:53:44.858 --> 00:53:46.957
- Now I'm a little
confused here. Uh...

737
00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.335
You mean...

738
00:53:51.865 --> 00:53:54.063
- I mean. this whole job
is a lie

739
00:53:54.098 --> 00:53:55.669
and it started as a lie.

740
00:53:55.704 --> 00:53:58.870
I don't like being lied to
and I don't like being used.

741
00:54:01.138 --> 00:54:02.742
- You're gonna help me
let Elijah go?

742
00:54:02.777 --> 00:54:04.106
- You have my word.

743
00:54:04.713 --> 00:54:05.976
- Well. sir...

744
00:54:07.452 --> 00:54:09.243
Sure is full of surprises.

745
00:54:09.278 --> 00:54:10.277
- Yeah.

746
00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:16.558
- Look who's coming.

747
00:54:25.404 --> 00:54:28.570
- Tiberio wants to start
negotiating about Elijah.

748
00:54:33.544 --> 00:54:35.203
Yeah. I'll handle the diplomacy.

749
00:54:35.238 --> 00:54:37.040
You go and cause
a little trouble.

750
00:54:37.075 --> 00:54:40.109
I don't want Tiberio
to think we're pushover.

751
00:54:40.144 --> 00:54:41.847
How about I go tell
Mr. Peckerwood

752
00:54:41.882 --> 00:54:43.145
over there a thing or two?

753
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.048
Seeing that he was
kind of insulting me...

754
00:54:46.084 --> 00:54:47.523
- Yeah. go ahead.

755
00:54:48.559 --> 00:54:49.888
Try not to kill him.

756
00:54:49.923 --> 00:54:51.219
- Yes. sir.

757
00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:53.991
- I'll go have a drink
and wait for Esteban.

758
00:55:23.792 --> 00:55:26.056
Well.
howdy. Tyree.

759
00:55:26.091 --> 00:55:27.695
Say. you remember me. right?

760
00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:29.356
The fellow with the gun?

761
00:55:29.391 --> 00:55:31.897
- Yeah. Out there
at the water hole.

762
00:55:31.932 --> 00:55:33.228
- That's right.

763
00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:35.472
- I see you still got
a real smart mouth.

764
00:55:35.936 --> 00:55:37.936
You need to learn some manners.

765
00:55:37.971 --> 00:55:41.236
Maybe I ought to bullwhip me
a real uppity fella.

766
00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:43.480
Just might do you some good.

767
00:55:45.748 --> 00:55:48.947
- Now. Jack. I know you ain't
the smartest man I ever met.

768
00:55:50.115 --> 00:55:54.084
but maybe you forgot that
I'm the one carrying the gun.

769
00:55:54.119 --> 00:55:55.492
- Yeah. well...

770
00:55:56.253 --> 00:55:58.286
Go ahead and shoot me.

771
00:55:58.321 --> 00:55:59.562
And those fellows over there...

772
00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:02.961
...well. they'll shoot you.

773
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.406
- Señor Borlund.
we meet another time.

774
00:56:10.102 --> 00:56:14.170
I'm afraid Tiberio has now heard
you're a bounty man. yes?

775
00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.481
He thought you were
looking for gold.

776
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.309
- Well. he'll just have to learn
to live with the truth.

777
00:56:30.694 --> 00:56:31.924
Thank you.

778
00:56:33.598 --> 00:56:35.895
- Tiberio feels he was deceived.

779
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:37.897
You should know this...

780
00:56:37.932 --> 00:56:41.098
Tiberio has made a business
arrangement with your prisoner.

781
00:56:43.872 --> 00:56:45.168
- I'm aware of that.

782
00:56:46.435 --> 00:56:50.371
But due to circumstances.
that deal is null and void.

783
00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:03.384
- That... idea will be
unacceptable.

784
00:57:04.563 --> 00:57:07.861
5.000 dollars American
is owed to him.

785
00:57:08.831 --> 00:57:10.600
- You know what?

786
00:57:10.635 --> 00:57:13.537
Goddamit. Jack. you're right.

787
00:57:13.572 --> 00:57:14.967
You're right.

788
00:57:15.002 --> 00:57:17.299
Because I occasionally
keep one of these handy

789
00:57:17.334 --> 00:57:20.038
when I gotta bullwhip me
some damn yokel.

790
00:57:26.211 --> 00:57:28.475
First five years in the army.
they had me working Teamster.

791
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:31.478
And I was cracking one of these
every day of the week.

792
00:58:19.033 --> 00:58:20.934
- Lucky son of a bitch.

793
00:58:26.271 --> 00:58:27.644
- Señor Borlund...

794
00:58:28.812 --> 00:58:30.911
My advice is for you
and your companion

795
00:58:30.946 --> 00:58:33.045
to go immediately
from this place.

796
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.212
Leave Trinidad Maria at once.

797
00:58:35.247 --> 00:58:37.720
but leave Mrs. Kidd
and Elijah behind.

798
00:58:37.755 --> 00:58:39.986
- That's good advice. No.

799
00:58:41.121 --> 00:58:45.288
You can explain to Señor Tiberio
that I am a man of the law.

800
00:58:46.764 --> 00:58:48.896
And Elijah is a criminal.

801
00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:20.631
- You don't much like me.
do you. Mr. Poe?

802
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.799
- I'm just doing my job. ma'am.

803
00:59:23.834 --> 00:59:26.329
And Mr. Borlund told me that
I need to watch over you. now.

804
00:59:26.364 --> 00:59:28.364
- It's because of Elijah.
isn't it?

805
00:59:29.675 --> 00:59:31.774
You hold the trouble
he's in against me.

806
00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:34.436
I understand that.

807
00:59:34.471 --> 00:59:36.614
But I take it.
despite everything...

808
00:59:37.639 --> 00:59:39.507
...you still like Elijah.

809
00:59:41.445 --> 00:59:43.313
- He's awful mad at me.

810
00:59:43.348 --> 00:59:44.820
Thinks I let him down.

811
00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:48.956
I still count him as a friend.

812
00:59:51.895 --> 00:59:55.930
- And now. we have these events
that really irritate Tiberio.

813
00:59:55.965 --> 00:59:59.802
The situation with this Señora
Kidd is<i> muy complicada.</i>

814
00:59:59.837 --> 01:00:02.464
This man makes things difficult
for Tiberio.

815
01:00:02.499 --> 01:00:06.501
he has little authority over
the situation in Trinidad Maria.

816
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.647
- This legal fellow got a name?

817
01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.881
- He's called Señor Max Borlund.

818
01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:16.951
- Uh. say that again.

819
01:00:16.986 --> 01:00:18.821
- Señor Max Borlund.

820
01:00:18.856 --> 01:00:21.153
He's a private investigator.

821
01:00:23.025 --> 01:00:24.926
- I know the man.

822
01:00:28.261 --> 01:00:30.701
You see this. Esteban?

823
01:00:30.736 --> 01:00:33.165
You put a gun in it.

824
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.706
and it's the devil's right hand.

825
01:00:49.348 --> 01:00:51.051
- I would like to see Elijah.

826
01:00:51.086 --> 01:00:53.350
You have him in that cell there.

827
01:00:53.385 --> 01:00:54.923
- Not possible. Señora.

828
01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:56.485
The prisoner will have
no visitors

829
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.553
until his legal status
is determined.

830
01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.159
He's in my custody. but...

831
01:01:00.194 --> 01:01:02.898
under the jurisdiction
of Mr. Borlund.

832
01:01:02.933 --> 01:01:04.559
- Mr...

833
01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:16.274
- I'll need my key. please.

834
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:19.211
- Did you have a pleasant walk?
- I did not.

835
01:01:19.246 --> 01:01:21.609
My friend is in jail and they
refuse to let me see him.

836
01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.281
Entirely because of Mr. Borlund.

837
01:01:23.316 --> 01:01:24.953
- Señora.

838
01:01:24.988 --> 01:01:27.989
This was left for you
by Mr. Borlund.

839
01:01:34.723 --> 01:01:36.734
- Elijah's gun and mine.

840
01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:42.300
Mr. Borlund is a man
of surprises.

841
01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:14.332
- Hola. Tiberio.

842
01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:17.269
- You were expecting me.

843
01:02:17.304 --> 01:02:18.600
- Yes. sir.

844
01:02:18.635 --> 01:02:20.602
After my friendly talk
with Esteban.

845
01:02:20.637 --> 01:02:23.781
I figured you might wanna
get to know Joe Cribbens.

846
01:02:24.806 --> 01:02:26.608
I hear all the news and gossip

847
01:02:26.643 --> 01:02:30.150
since I've been staying in this
near-ghost town of yours.

848
01:02:31.054 --> 01:02:33.714
I even hear you're up against
Max Borlund.

849
01:02:34.486 --> 01:02:36.651
He's a man with a reputation.

850
01:02:37.621 --> 01:02:39.192
And I owe him.

851
01:02:39.227 --> 01:02:40.864
- You owe him?

852
01:02:40.899 --> 01:02:42.228
A favor?

853
01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:45.000
- No.<i> jefe.</i>

854
01:02:45.035 --> 01:02:46.903
He's not my amigo.

855
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:49.301
<i>- Oy. hombre.</i>

856
01:02:52.504 --> 01:02:56.539
Why don't you tell me about
this... Max Borlund?

857
01:02:56.574 --> 01:02:59.509
Then. afterwards. maybe I have
somebody shoot you.

858
01:03:01.315 --> 01:03:03.216
- Have I offended you.<i> jefe?</i>

859
01:03:03.251 --> 01:03:04.811
- You killed the Englishman.

860
01:03:04.846 --> 01:03:07.990
He was doing a land contract
with me for many pesos.

861
01:03:08.025 --> 01:03:10.520
- He accused me of cheating.
- Were you guilty?

862
01:03:10.555 --> 01:03:12.555
- I didn't need to cheat him.

863
01:03:13.426 --> 01:03:15.228
I'm a good card player.

864
01:03:16.363 --> 01:03:18.066
- So am I.<i> hombre.</i>

865
01:03:18.101 --> 01:03:19.694
So am I.

866
01:03:32.918 --> 01:03:34.412
- Three cards.

867
01:03:50.562 --> 01:03:53.101
I wanna see what you have.
<i>jefe.</i>

868
01:03:54.896 --> 01:03:56.137
- I have the winner.

869
01:03:58.372 --> 01:04:00.735
- Ah... Sorry.<i> jefe.</i>

870
01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.314
- Most men are afraid
to beat me at cards.

871
01:04:08.954 --> 01:04:10.481
To take my money.

872
01:04:11.913 --> 01:04:14.551
- If I lost on purpose.
I'd be insulting you.

873
01:04:15.422 --> 01:04:18.852
This way. I prove I respect
the way you honor a game

874
01:04:18.887 --> 01:04:21.261
of skill and good fortune.

875
01:04:22.495 --> 01:04:23.758
<i>- Americano?</i>

876
01:04:24.629 --> 01:04:26.970
<i>- Americano.</i> from Texas.

877
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.273
- I decide not to kill you.

878
01:04:33.308 --> 01:04:35.209
I decide to use you.

879
01:04:35.244 --> 01:04:37.277
<i>Oy. hombre.</i>
I don't like to lose money.

880
01:04:37.312 --> 01:04:38.740
Another game.

881
01:04:38.775 --> 01:04:40.280
But understand this:

882
01:04:40.315 --> 01:04:42.183
Now. you work for me.

883
01:04:43.021 --> 01:04:44.680
You will follow orders.

884
01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:14.710
- Old man. go find the gringo
bounty man.

885
01:05:15.548 --> 01:05:18.153
Tell him to prepare
to go to hell.

886
01:05:18.188 --> 01:05:20.353
Tell him I intend to kill him.

887
01:06:08.568 --> 01:06:10.238
Joe Cribbens.

888
01:06:10.273 --> 01:06:11.800
What. you know him?

889
01:06:11.835 --> 01:06:13.538
- He's a dangerous man.

890
01:06:14.541 --> 01:06:16.739
- You ain't got nothing
to worry about.

891
01:06:16.774 --> 01:06:19.412
He kill you. I kill him.

892
01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:32.095
- I hear you're breaking
your promise.

893
01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:33.756
You're looking for me.
after all.

894
01:06:33.791 --> 01:06:36.429
- Yeah. Time and circumstance.

895
01:06:36.464 --> 01:06:39.036
Besides. it's a long
time coming.

896
01:06:40.105 --> 01:06:42.699
I got lots of personal feelings
against you. Mr. Borlund.

897
01:06:42.734 --> 01:06:44.998
but that's not why I'm here.

898
01:06:45.033 --> 01:06:47.407
Right now. I'm just getting
paid to do a job.

899
01:06:48.707 --> 01:06:52.445
But first. since this
is a special occasion.

900
01:06:53.481 --> 01:06:55.382
I guess I'd...

901
01:06:55.417 --> 01:06:57.417
kind of like to have me a drink.

902
01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:13.598
Time to settle up.

903
01:07:13.633 --> 01:07:16.205
I like to pay off what I owe.

904
01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.537
You low-rate me. Mr. Borlund.

905
01:07:18.572 --> 01:07:20.209
Always have.

906
01:07:20.244 --> 01:07:23.036
So. before I lay you low.

907
01:07:23.071 --> 01:07:26.479
I'm gonna teach you
how to show me a little respect.

908
01:07:27.944 --> 01:07:29.009
Have one.

909
01:07:30.188 --> 01:07:31.748
- Skip the bullshit.

910
01:07:32.586 --> 01:07:34.685
But you can tell me
who's paying you.

911
01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:37.226
- Figure you already
know the answer.

912
01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:39.591
- Oh. Tiberio's got you
doing the dirty work.

913
01:07:39.626 --> 01:07:41.725
- Tiberio's got me doing
the hard work.

914
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.496
See it as a compliment.

915
01:07:43.531 --> 01:07:44.761
- I was expecting you was trying

916
01:07:44.796 --> 01:07:46.928
to come in on Mr. Borlund's
bounty money.

917
01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:49.667
- I don't make my pesos
that way.

918
01:07:51.099 --> 01:07:53.671
I've done a few things
not on the square.

919
01:07:54.509 --> 01:07:56.377
But I never sink that low.

920
01:08:02.044 --> 01:08:03.186
Well...

921
01:08:08.325 --> 01:08:10.622
If you're not gonna
drink with me...

922
01:08:11.889 --> 01:08:13.460
I guess it's time...

923
01:08:14.529 --> 01:08:16.496
...to see how good
you really are.

924
01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:18.168
- Gonna have to take us both.

925
01:08:19.501 --> 01:08:21.666
- Your move. Joe.
- Gentlemen.

926
01:08:25.309 --> 01:08:28.475
My name is Rachel Kidd.
if it's of any interest.

927
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:30.136
- Don't be getting in this.
ma'am.

928
01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:34.107
- He's right. Mrs. Kidd.
You best back away.

929
01:08:34.142 --> 01:08:36.285
- Mr. Borlund and I
have our differences.

930
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:38.045
But he doesn't deserve
to be gunned down

931
01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.849
by a common criminal.

932
01:08:39.884 --> 01:08:42.456
- Oh. I'm not so common. ma'am.

933
01:08:42.491 --> 01:08:45.888
And even though you seem to
have a real unpleasant nature.

934
01:08:45.923 --> 01:08:48.858
I'd still hate to put
the finish on a woman.

935
01:08:49.498 --> 01:08:52.532
It ain't my style.

936
01:08:52.567 --> 01:08:55.095
- At this distance.
I don't think I'm going to miss.

937
01:08:56.197 --> 01:08:58.802
Now. listen to me
very carefully.

938
01:08:58.837 --> 01:09:00.870
I will not lose my nerve.

939
01:09:00.905 --> 01:09:02.707
I will pull the trigger.

940
01:09:02.742 --> 01:09:04.544
I promise.

941
01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:15.324
- You proud?

942
01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:18.921
Hiding behind a backup gun
and a woman.

943
01:09:19.726 --> 01:09:21.154
- Tell you what. Joe.

944
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:23.563
I think I'd ride on out
before she gets nervous

945
01:09:23.598 --> 01:09:25.961
and accidentally
pulls the trigger.

946
01:09:27.602 --> 01:09:29.063
- Okay. amigo.

947
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:35.036
I guess this hand goes to you.

948
01:09:35.071 --> 01:09:38.611
But... this ain't over yet.

949
01:09:52.594 --> 01:09:55.430
- Told you. Ain't got
nothing to worry about.

950
01:09:56.928 --> 01:09:59.269
- Once again. Mr. Poe.
very good.

951
01:10:00.338 --> 01:10:02.767
- Once good. I aim to please.

952
01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:17.419
- Guess it was a good thing
you gave me back my gun.

953
01:10:17.454 --> 01:10:20.114
- Joe was right.
This isn't over.

954
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:24.393
But I appreciate what you did.
even though it was very foolish.

955
01:10:24.428 --> 01:10:27.660
- You probably saved my life
back in the cabin.

956
01:10:27.695 --> 01:10:29.464
I owed you.

957
01:10:29.499 --> 01:10:31.026
I try to pay my debts.

958
01:10:32.337 --> 01:10:34.832
I don't really drink.
but I think I need this.

959
01:10:45.647 --> 01:10:48.813
- Come to check
on the deserter man.

960
01:10:48.848 --> 01:10:51.618
- How long you figure
before Rachel's husband arrives?

961
01:10:52.489 --> 01:10:54.148
- About another day or two.

962
01:10:56.284 --> 01:10:58.218
- He better be bringing
his money.

963
01:11:48.578 --> 01:11:50.072
- Driver!

964
01:11:50.107 --> 01:11:51.414
Why in the hell
are we stopping?

965
01:11:51.449 --> 01:11:53.174
It's the middle of nowhere.

966
01:11:54.551 --> 01:11:56.177
- Hello. ladies.

967
01:11:56.212 --> 01:11:58.014
Martin Kidd. right?

968
01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:01.017
You step on out
and come with me.

969
01:12:01.052 --> 01:12:02.722
<i>Por favor.</i>

970
01:12:02.757 --> 01:12:05.461
Mr. Tiberio Vargas would like
to have a talk with you.

971
01:12:24.581 --> 01:12:29.045
I... speak English
a little bit.

972
01:12:29.883 --> 01:12:31.784
But only when I want to.

973
01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:22.362
<i>- Vamos.</i>

974
01:13:26.467 --> 01:13:29.402
- Mr. Kidd.
- Mr. Borlund!

975
01:13:29.437 --> 01:13:32.306
You're my welcoming party.
It's good to see you.

976
01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:33.945
How's my wife?

977
01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:36.409
- She's in the hotel
down the road.

978
01:13:36.444 --> 01:13:39.852
- Oh. that's where she is.
but how is she?

979
01:13:39.887 --> 01:13:43.526
- The past few weeks have been
very difficult for her.

980
01:13:44.562 --> 01:13:45.858
- And Elijah Jones?

981
01:13:45.893 --> 01:13:48.289
- He's in a jail cell
around the corner.

982
01:13:48.324 --> 01:13:52.029
- Good. I'll go visit Rachel
in due course.

983
01:13:52.064 --> 01:13:55.197
I'm in no hurry to deal
with her salacious conduct.

984
01:13:56.497 --> 01:13:59.366
Have you met this
Tiberio Vargas?

985
01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:02.204
- Only once.
- He's quite a fellow.

986
01:14:03.504 --> 01:14:06.648
Well. I owe you a debt
of gratitude

987
01:14:06.683 --> 01:14:08.551
for rounding up
these two runaways.

988
01:14:08.586 --> 01:14:10.014
- You owe me money.

989
01:14:10.049 --> 01:14:12.489
- Oh. I do. And you'll be paid.

990
01:14:13.316 --> 01:14:14.524
Paid in full.

991
01:14:58.933 --> 01:15:01.263
- If I may join you.
I wish to discuss with you

992
01:15:01.298 --> 01:15:03.540
the situation we find
ourselves in.

993
01:15:04.136 --> 01:15:05.674
- Then...

994
01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:08.534
I guess we oughta
discuss Tiberio.

995
01:15:08.569 --> 01:15:10.712
since nobody around here
can take a piss

996
01:15:10.747 --> 01:15:12.373
without him saying so.

997
01:15:12.408 --> 01:15:14.683
- Tiberio is of course
disappointed.

998
01:15:14.718 --> 01:15:16.949
He feels your tactics
were too bold.

999
01:15:16.984 --> 01:15:19.380
You were foolish and arrogant.

1000
01:15:20.757 --> 01:15:23.087
I am here to tell you that

1001
01:15:23.122 --> 01:15:26.156
Tiberio has no further need
of your services.

1002
01:15:28.798 --> 01:15:30.490
You are dismissed.

1003
01:15:31.966 --> 01:15:33.636
You're free to go.

1004
01:16:29.056 --> 01:16:32.519
- One thing about you and
your kind. Mr. Cockroach.

1005
01:16:32.554 --> 01:16:34.488
can't get rid of you. can we?

1006
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:38.833
Yes. sir. you sons of bitches

1007
01:16:38.868 --> 01:16:42.166
must be first cousin
with Mr. Boll Weevil.

1008
01:16:43.235 --> 01:16:45.466
And that means nothing much
good to be said.

1009
01:16:46.304 --> 01:16:48.238
Just a goddamn nuisance.

1010
01:17:12.330 --> 01:17:13.527
- Mr. Borlund.

1011
01:17:14.068 --> 01:17:16.596
- Have you seen
your husband yet?

1012
01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:22.008
I think he made some kind
of a deal with Tiberio Vargas.

1013
01:17:22.043 --> 01:17:23.537
probably about you.

1014
01:17:23.572 --> 01:17:25.880
I just wanted to make sure
you're alright.

1015
01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:31.248
- I saw his arrival on
the overland from the parlor.

1016
01:17:32.515 --> 01:17:35.384
It cost me a difficult moment.

1017
01:17:35.419 --> 01:17:38.090
But I'm fine. Mr. Borlund.
Thank you for your concern.

1018
01:17:41.293 --> 01:17:42.699
Just a moment.

1019
01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.403
My last will and testament.

1020
01:17:54.438 --> 01:17:57.043
My lawyer's name is on
the front of the envelope.

1021
01:17:57.078 --> 01:17:59.749
To be delivered
in the event of my death.

1022
01:18:17.725 --> 01:18:19.230
Yeah.

1023
01:18:19.265 --> 01:18:20.770
Must be getting me
out of here.

1024
01:18:20.805 --> 01:18:22.772
You know. I figured Tiberio

1025
01:18:22.807 --> 01:18:26.776
would see the light.
Me and him. we got business.

1026
01:18:32.850 --> 01:18:34.751
- Hello. Elijah.

1027
01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:37.644
- Mr. Kidd.

1028
01:18:39.956 --> 01:18:41.615
Now. uh...

1029
01:18:44.587 --> 01:18:47.060
I can't say I expected you
to come down here.

1030
01:18:47.095 --> 01:18:49.590
- No small talk. Elijah.

1031
01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:51.262
It's time to pay you off.

1032
01:18:54.135 --> 01:18:55.904
You gonna shoot
an unarmed man?

1033
01:18:55.939 --> 01:18:57.807
- Yeah.

1034
01:19:04.882 --> 01:19:06.849
Put a gun
in his hand.

1035
01:19:06.884 --> 01:19:08.950
You open that cell door.

1036
01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:11.447
He was trying to escape.

1037
01:19:36.210 --> 01:19:37.308
He was dead

1038
01:19:37.343 --> 01:19:39.079
when he fell to the floor
of his cell.

1039
01:19:41.545 --> 01:19:42.984
- Poor Elijah.

1040
01:19:57.528 --> 01:20:00.067
- Ah. Mr. Borlund. I expect
you've heard the news.

1041
01:20:00.102 --> 01:20:03.939
US Army Private Elijah Jones
is no longer a problem.

1042
01:20:04.436 --> 01:20:07.338
- How much did it cost
Mr. Kidd to commit this murder?

1043
01:20:07.373 --> 01:20:09.472
- I'm investigating
these circumstances.

1044
01:20:09.507 --> 01:20:11.705
- I am confused. Mr. Borlund.

1045
01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.476
Who do you think
you're working for?

1046
01:20:13.511 --> 01:20:16.215
- I work for myself.
Always have.

1047
01:20:16.921 --> 01:20:18.580
- I was dishonored.

1048
01:20:18.615 --> 01:20:20.890
A wife is not supposed
to run away from her husband

1049
01:20:20.925 --> 01:20:22.518
with a common soldier.

1050
01:20:22.553 --> 01:20:24.586
- You mean common
Black soldiers?

1051
01:20:25.688 --> 01:20:27.754
- Yeah. that's exactly
what I mean.

1052
01:20:27.789 --> 01:20:31.296
Common... Black... soldiers.

1053
01:20:32.299 --> 01:20:34.068
- I tell you again.
I'm investigating--

1054
01:21:33.195 --> 01:21:35.624
I'd like to see
my wife. Mrs. Rachel Kidd.

1055
01:21:35.659 --> 01:21:37.934
Can you tell me her room number?

1056
01:21:39.135 --> 01:21:40.970
- She's in number 4.

1057
01:21:41.005 --> 01:21:42.697
Up the stairs.

1058
01:22:06.459 --> 01:22:07.964
- Martin.

1059
01:22:10.727 --> 01:22:15.334
- I am. uh... a bit slow
on coming to see you.

1060
01:22:15.369 --> 01:22:17.336
Of course. there's no point
in pretending

1061
01:22:17.371 --> 01:22:20.669
that there's any affection
between us. is there?

1062
01:22:20.704 --> 01:22:23.177
- No. None at all.

1063
01:22:25.313 --> 01:22:26.807
I take it you owe Mr. Borlund

1064
01:22:26.842 --> 01:22:29.051
a great deal of money
for finding me.

1065
01:22:29.086 --> 01:22:31.317
- Mr. Borlund will receive
what he's earned.

1066
01:22:31.352 --> 01:22:34.617
- Just like Elijah?
Did he receive what he earned?

1067
01:22:34.652 --> 01:22:37.323
- Uh. no. I was too good to him.
He died a quick death.

1068
01:22:37.358 --> 01:22:39.556
- You are despicable. Martin.

1069
01:22:42.594 --> 01:22:44.033
- You're breaking marriage vows.

1070
01:22:44.068 --> 01:22:46.233
You run away with
an army deserter

1071
01:22:46.268 --> 01:22:49.731
who's also a criminal low-life
demanding ransom money

1072
01:22:49.766 --> 01:22:51.568
for your services to him
as a whore.

1073
01:22:51.603 --> 01:22:54.373
You come very close
to jeopardizing my future

1074
01:22:54.408 --> 01:22:56.507
political career
with this lurid scandal.

1075
01:22:56.542 --> 01:22:59.411
and then you tell me
that I'm despicable?

1076
01:22:59.446 --> 01:23:00.610
- I was stupid.

1077
01:23:01.514 --> 01:23:03.151
I made bad situations worse

1078
01:23:03.186 --> 01:23:04.911
which caused terrible
things to happen.

1079
01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:06.682
I have no excuse.

1080
01:23:06.717 --> 01:23:08.090
You just wanted legitimacy

1081
01:23:08.125 --> 01:23:09.982
and the security
of my future inheritance.

1082
01:23:10.017 --> 01:23:11.225
We never loved each other.

1083
01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.820
- Hmm.
- It was all just

1084
01:23:12.855 --> 01:23:14.360
mutual convenience.

1085
01:23:14.395 --> 01:23:16.824
- I intend to return to Santa Fe

1086
01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:19.563
where the story'll be put out
in the newspapers

1087
01:23:19.598 --> 01:23:22.236
how I killed my wife's abductor
in a heroic act.

1088
01:23:22.271 --> 01:23:24.403
but that she was unfortunately
captured and killed

1089
01:23:24.438 --> 01:23:26.603
by a gang of Mexican outlaws.

1090
01:23:26.638 --> 01:23:29.375
killed after. you know.
being used by them

1091
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:31.740
in the lowest possible ways.

1092
01:23:31.775 --> 01:23:32.741
- Good story.

1093
01:23:32.776 --> 01:23:34.248
Sad thing is a lot of people

1094
01:23:34.283 --> 01:23:35.513
will probably believe it.

1095
01:23:35.548 --> 01:23:37.009
- It's gonna be quite close
to the truth.

1096
01:23:37.044 --> 01:23:39.451
Given your appetite.
you might enjoy being fucked

1097
01:23:39.486 --> 01:23:43.884
up. down and sideways by those
<i>vaqueros</i> before they kill you.

1098
01:23:43.919 --> 01:23:45.424
They will of course kill you.

1099
01:23:45.459 --> 01:23:49.824
No. it's part of my
understanding with Señor Vargas.

1100
01:23:50.662 --> 01:23:53.432
- You think I'll go willingly?
- Oh no.

1101
01:23:54.237 --> 01:23:57.865
But these men are quite
happy to use force.

1102
01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.999
And you have nowhere to hide.

1103
01:24:02.069 --> 01:24:06.313
I'll leave you now
to think about your future.

1104
01:24:08.614 --> 01:24:11.186
- I don't think it's going
to work out the way you want.

1105
01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.949
- You won't do it.

1106
01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:18.556
You don't actually
have the nerve to kill a man.

1107
01:24:18.591 --> 01:24:20.129
- I've changed.

1108
01:24:20.164 --> 01:24:23.022
And you always underestimate me.

1109
01:24:24.091 --> 01:24:26.729
- I repeat... You won't do--

1110
01:24:50.788 --> 01:24:52.722
I heard a shot!
Are you...

1111
01:24:55.397 --> 01:24:57.364
- I've killed my husband.

1112
01:25:00.336 --> 01:25:02.699
- Well. you gave him
what he deserved.

1113
01:25:02.734 --> 01:25:04.569
He killed Elijah.

1114
01:25:06.133 --> 01:25:07.473
- Yes.

1115
01:25:09.345 --> 01:25:11.070
I'm not sorry.

1116
01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:35.990
Knock next time!

1117
01:28:38.048 --> 01:28:39.245
I assume...

1118
01:28:39.951 --> 01:28:42.182
...you intend to defend
Mrs. Kidd?

1119
01:28:42.217 --> 01:28:44.217
- And I imagine you have
a nice safe spot

1120
01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:45.757
picked out for yourself.

1121
01:28:45.792 --> 01:28:47.759
- I will ignore your insult.

1122
01:28:48.729 --> 01:28:50.762
And I promise you
I will do my duty today

1123
01:28:50.797 --> 01:28:52.159
as an officer of the law.

1124
01:28:52.194 --> 01:28:54.634
- Just like you did
with Elijah Jones?

1125
01:28:55.395 --> 01:28:57.131
- That was my mistake.

1126
01:28:57.771 --> 01:29:00.706
I should have realized Mr. Kidd
intended to kill Elijah.

1127
01:29:01.808 --> 01:29:03.412
He bribed my deputy.

1128
01:29:06.142 --> 01:29:07.449
I am ashamed.

1129
01:33:01.608 --> 01:33:03.410
I'm taking you
out. mister.

1130
01:33:03.445 --> 01:33:05.852
- Alright then.
go ahead and try.

1131
01:34:32.435 --> 01:34:34.600
I thought
that you were smarter...

1132
01:34:37.242 --> 01:34:39.539
...than getting
in the middle of this.

1133
01:34:50.552 --> 01:34:53.157
Ride out of here
before I decide to shoot you.

1134
01:34:53.797 --> 01:34:55.830
- I thank you for your
courtesy and kindness.

1135
01:35:28.788 --> 01:35:30.425
- Tiberio Vargas!

1136
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:53.822
Yah!

1137
01:36:14.174 --> 01:36:15.635
- Tiberio!

1138
01:36:16.077 --> 01:36:17.604
Just want to tell you.

1139
01:36:17.639 --> 01:36:19.672
since I'm not working
for you anymore.

1140
01:36:19.707 --> 01:36:22.180
I think you're shit.

1141
01:36:22.215 --> 01:36:23.709
Always did.

1142
01:36:36.196 --> 01:36:37.558
Guess what?

1143
01:36:37.593 --> 01:36:39.791
I did you a favor. bounty man.

1144
01:36:39.826 --> 01:36:43.498
You're gonna thank me
for killing my old boss?

1145
01:36:45.370 --> 01:36:47.942
He was gonna spoil
my fun with you.

1146
01:36:50.573 --> 01:36:52.914
- About time you did
something good.

1147
01:37:01.881 --> 01:37:04.024
You know. you can
ride out of here. Joe.

1148
01:37:06.094 --> 01:37:08.358
- I took his money.

1149
01:37:08.393 --> 01:37:10.063
Maybe ought to earn it.

1150
01:37:11.297 --> 01:37:14.364
Besides. there's no avoiding it.

1151
01:37:15.301 --> 01:37:17.499
You and me got a reckoning.

1152
01:37:17.534 --> 01:37:21.338
- I'm giving you a clean start.
Don't be a damn fool!

1153
01:37:21.373 --> 01:37:23.406
- Amigo...

1154
01:37:23.441 --> 01:37:25.375
I was born a fool.

1155
01:37:33.451 --> 01:37:35.385
I'll be a son of a bitch.

1156
01:37:36.993 --> 01:37:38.586
You killed me.

1157
01:37:43.791 --> 01:37:45.395
Luck ran out.

1158
01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.234
I'm just dying.

1159
01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:54.206
Happens to us all.

1160
01:37:54.241 --> 01:37:55.438
Don't it?

1161
01:38:21.004 --> 01:38:22.399
- Mr. Poe.

1162
01:38:24.370 --> 01:38:26.436
- Mr. Borlund.

1163
01:38:33.346 --> 01:38:35.610
- I'm gonna make sure
that your body gets sent

1164
01:38:35.645 --> 01:38:38.316
back to the army. They'll give
you a proper finish.

1165
01:38:38.351 --> 01:38:40.318
bugle. flags...

1166
01:38:40.353 --> 01:38:41.814
A man can do worse.

1167
01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:43.783
- Goddamit. I...

1168
01:38:43.818 --> 01:38:45.719
I've been shot.
but I ain't dying.

1169
01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:49.789
Just make sure the damn doctor
don't cut my arm off.

1170
01:38:50.561 --> 01:38:52.462
- Yeah. you have my word.

1171
01:39:05.246 --> 01:39:07.147
Your husband's dead.

1172
01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:12.581
He was obviously shot
by Tiberio's men.

1173
01:39:16.356 --> 01:39:19.060
- You really think
the truth won't come out?

1174
01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:21.689
- Who's to ask?

1175
01:39:22.659 --> 01:39:24.197
Well. who is to tell?

1176
01:39:28.434 --> 01:39:31.237
Oh. you need that looked after.

1177
01:39:31.272 --> 01:39:33.206
It's gonna take a few stitches.

1178
01:39:34.737 --> 01:39:37.441
- I'll wear my scar
as a badge of honor.

1179
01:39:38.543 --> 01:39:40.444
- Mm-hmm.

1180
01:39:43.185 --> 01:39:44.877
I need a drink.
