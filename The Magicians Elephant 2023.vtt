3
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:30.250
Speed. spirit.

4
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:35.166
and a really large fish.
the three tools of a hero!

5
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:38.583
Hang on. That doesn't make any…

6
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.750
Speed. spirit and a very large…?

7
00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:42.375
I'm getting ahead of myself.

8
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.291
If I'm gonna tell this story…

9
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.416
-I've got to catch you up on everything.

10
00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:59.375
So. there was
this town once. Baltese.

11
00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:01.291
Oh. you should have seen it.

12
00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:05.125
-Which I guess you are now. so. good.

13
00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:09.458
The sort of place
where everything felt possible

14
00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.875
or even magical.

15
00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.416
like that lady
making the fountain go nuts.

16
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.375
Check this out!

17
00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:20.416
Or these kids.
doing some sophisticated. magical…

18
00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:23.291
Inappropriate!

19
00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:27.833
Anyway.
times changed. like times do.

20
00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:31.125
And let me tell you. it wasn't good.

21
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.791
There was the Great Foreign War.
and after that.

22
00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:38.916
people in Baltese just stopped believing.

23
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.666
-Nothing felt possible or magical.

24
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.458
and then the clouds rolled in.

25
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:52.208
Strange clouds that never break
or budge or snow.

26
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:58.583
The town's been stuck.
but things are about to get unstuck.

27
00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:02.916
I mean. otherwise. why would I tell
this story? That'd be pretty boring.

28
00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:10.791
Peter is an orphan
being raised by an old soldier.

29
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:15.750
The soldier knows about fighting
and hardship and danger.

30
00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:18.333
so he's training the boy
for that kind of life.

31
00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:21.958
But the boy knows there must be more.

32
00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:25.583
Peter. other children have families.

33
00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:28.083
but as orphan. you have a rare privilege.

34
00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:31.416
You can devote yourself to soldier's life.

35
00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:33.291
Attention.

36
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:36.208
Here is coin for today.

37
00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:40.083
Get our fish and bread now

38
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:41.833
before you begin your marching.

39
00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:46.625
Older bread the better.
bread to make your teeth… strong.

40
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:49.958
and small fish
so you are accustomed to hunger.

41
00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:52.750
-For what are we?
-We're soldiers. sir.

42
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.375
-And what is this?
-The world.

43
00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:57.958
And what is the world?

44
00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:00.041
Hard.

45
00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:30.541
-Good morning. Mrs. Taylor.
-Good morning. Peter.

46
00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:32.541
Hmm.

47
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:36.750
Are you going to the opera tonight. madam?

48
00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:40.416
Certainly. The only thing
I enjoy in this town.

49
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.583
Good morning.

50
00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:45.000
Ah. Peter. I saved you
a beautiful piece today

51
00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:47.000
that you can't refuse.

52
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.500
Come on. you know Vilna.

53
00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:52.458
I know. I know.

54
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:54.625
Old bread and small fish.

55
00:03:57.083 --> 00:03:59.041
-Careful!

56
00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:00.291
No!

57
00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:04.000
Hey. Peter. Here's
the most disappointing fish for you.

58
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.833
Oh no. no. no. no!

59
00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:12.166
-Mind yourself.

60
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.416
What?

61
00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:31.666
"The most profound and difficult questions

62
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.416
that could possibly be posed
by the human heart or mind

63
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.250
will be answered
for the price of one coin."

64
00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:43.875
One coin.

65
00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:53.750
I have to know.

66
00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:06.666
Whoa.

67
00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.791
Your Guardian Vilna Lutz will be angry
if you return without dinner.

68
00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:20.666
Where'd you come from?
How do you know that?

69
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.833
But you must ask yourself.

70
00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:27.166
one day without food
or the rest of your life without knowing?

71
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.875
Mm.

72
00:05:58.916 --> 00:05:59.833
She lives.

73
00:05:59.916 --> 00:06:00.833
What?

74
00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:12.041
-How do you--?
-One coin. one question.

75
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.666
Careful.

76
00:06:23.208 --> 00:06:27.750
Well. my family died in the war when I was
three years old. There was a battle--

77
00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:29.083
There was a battle.

78
00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:32.875
Vilna Lutz rescued you.
and he's raising you to be a soldier.

79
00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.416
-What?
-I know.

80
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.625
When my father died. my mother--

81
00:06:36.708 --> 00:06:39.666
She was expecting a child. I also know.

82
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.041
Sergeant Lutz told me
that during the birth.

83
00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:44.458
both she and the baby died. but--

84
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:45.458
But you remember?

85
00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:48.958
I held her. I know I did.

86
00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.083
Your sister?

87
00:06:50.708 --> 00:06:51.833
My sister.

88
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.791
She was so small and she was--

89
00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:56.916
Alive. Yes.

90
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.875
-Why did Vilna Lutz tell me--?
-No.

91
00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:03.000
You will only get one question.
so be careful.

92
00:07:03.083 --> 00:07:04.375
Will I ever see her--?

93
00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:07.208
Stop! Stop and think for a moment.

94
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:10.250
Think of the right question. Peter.

95
00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:15.000
How do I find her?

96
00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:18.125
Yes. good. Very good.

97
00:07:18.708 --> 00:07:20.333
And the answer is…

98
00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:23.375
follow the elephant.

99
00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:28.083
-You're having fun with me.
-You have your answer.

100
00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:31.583
"Follow the elephant?"
I gave you our one coin for today.

101
00:07:31.666 --> 00:07:34.416
You made a choice. You asked a question.

102
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.041
And you cheated me.

103
00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:38.583
Follow the elephant and you'll find her.

104
00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:41.083
But there aren't any elephants here!

105
00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:42.708
Just as you say.

106
00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:59.041
We have no dinner tonight
because of Fortune Teller?

107
00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:03.083
Yes. sir. but she knew
so much about me! About you! I--

108
00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:06.708
How could she know about me?
I do not even know about me.

109
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:09.250
She said that my sister lives

110
00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:11.250
and to follow an elephant.

111
00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:12.833
An elephant? Your sister?

112
00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:17.000
I know. sir. You've told me
all these years that my sister--

113
00:08:17.083 --> 00:08:19.000
Not again with this.

114
00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:23.458
Your poor mother. your sister.

115
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:24.750
Both of them died.

116
00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:29.541
I saved you.
which was all that I could do!

117
00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:31.000
But I…

118
00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:33.916
Top shelf.

119
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.250
Kitchen cabinet.

120
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:48.000
A storybook? Who is Romain De Smedt--?

121
00:08:48.083 --> 00:08:51.291
Gimme. gimme. gimme!
Romain De Smedt drive me crazy.

122
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:55.125
Young soldier I served with. good boy.

123
00:08:55.833 --> 00:09:00.166
But he read this book at night
which remind him of home.

124
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.958
of mother. of comfort.

125
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.041
I had to cure him of all of this.

126
00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:06.375
-So I stole De Smedt's book.

127
00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:07.500
What?

128
00:09:07.583 --> 00:09:09.125
And it worked.

129
00:09:09.208 --> 00:09:13.458
Without this book. he turned
into the most fearsome soldier in army.

130
00:09:13.541 --> 00:09:15.000
Why are you telling me this?

131
00:09:15.083 --> 00:09:17.500
Where there is comfort.
there is innocence.

132
00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:19.625
Where there is innocence.

133
00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:23.083
there can never be soldier.

134
00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:27.416
Peter. today.

135
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.875
you were told… a fairy tale.

136
00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.625
One just as false as any in this book!

137
00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:41.208
There are no elephants.

138
00:09:41.291 --> 00:09:43.375
If there were elephants…

139
00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:47.333
…I would spot them immediately!

140
00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:51.000
Ah. You hear that?

141
00:09:53.083 --> 00:09:54.625
Some kind of disturbance.

142
00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:56.041
Hand me the spyglass.

143
00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:57.666
It's just the cats.

144
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:01.083
Spyglass. Spyglass. Peter.
Spyglass! Spyglass! Peter!

145
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.416
Amazing.

146
00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:17.125
Very clever.

147
00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:19.875
Yeah. That is a smart strategy.

148
00:10:20.875 --> 00:10:22.958
If only I could find a pattern.

149
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.541
Peter. it's time to march.

150
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.166
Go. March. march. march.

151
00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:42.250
-Furry little paws.

152
00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:45.166
Razor-sharp talons.

153
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.083
-Oh. what did you put in this?
-Turmeric.

154
00:10:59.166 --> 00:11:02.375
-Really? At dinner time?

155
00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.375
I'm on it.

156
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.708
Excuse me? Peter?

157
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.250
Typically. we're spared marching
during the dinner hour.

158
00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:22.583
Yes. sir.

159
00:11:22.666 --> 00:11:26.333
I have to do extra because I spent
our dinner money on a Fortune Teller.

160
00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:28.833
Mm. And what did they tell you?

161
00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:33.625
To follow an elephant…
which doesn't exist.

162
00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:34.541
Mm.

163
00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:36.250
Yes.

164
00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:39.291
But what if it did?

165
00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:41.916
Leo Matienne!

166
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.583
My wife. she's tired of my "what ifs."

167
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.458
The elephant will lead me to my sister.

168
00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:51.708
Peter! March. now!

169
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.041
A child shouldn't live like that.
marching and marching.

170
00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:01.625
It's none of our business. Leo.

171
00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:13.541
Now. at the exact same time across town.

172
00:12:14.458 --> 00:12:16.208
there was a show with--

173
00:12:16.291 --> 00:12:18.125
No. not that guy!

174
00:12:18.208 --> 00:12:20.833
The opening act is a magician.

175
00:12:20.916 --> 00:12:22.166
Thank you so much.

176
00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:26.250
It's not going well.

177
00:12:27.416 --> 00:12:30.333
Mystery and wonderment!

178
00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:38.250
-Ace of diamonds!
-Nope.

179
00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:41.250
The Hoops of Delirium!

180
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.541
-No. no. no. no. no. no!

181
00:12:54.416 --> 00:12:56.125
Oh.

182
00:13:02.791 --> 00:13:05.000
I have one final trick.

183
00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:06.750
Excellent news!

184
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:11.666
I will need a volunteer.

185
00:13:12.916 --> 00:13:15.458
Madam. if you please.

186
00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:20.916
Please.

187
00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:30.833
Have a seat. madam.

188
00:13:38.666 --> 00:13:40.916
Can we just get it over with?

189
00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:45.791
The Magician isn't great at magic.

190
00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:50.125
but even if he was.
he realizes this crowd wouldn't care.

191
00:13:50.708 --> 00:13:52.375
And that's what does it.

192
00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:56.500
He decides to try a powerful spell.

193
00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:00.916
something to restore
and revive all of Baltese.

194
00:14:07.583 --> 00:14:11.916
One elegant.
invisible moment of profound change.

195
00:14:23.666 --> 00:14:24.541
Now!

196
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.458
Like I said. he's not great at magic.

197
00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:41.833
Let me explain!

198
00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.041
Do you have a name?

199
00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:26.416
Do you have a name?

200
00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:39.375
What? What the…?

201
00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:49.583
Hey! Hey. do you know what happened to
the Fortune Teller's tent that was there?

202
00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:50.916
No tent there yesterday.

203
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.833
Mm. Was a tent once.
Maybe it was just laundry.

204
00:15:54.916 --> 00:15:57.250
-Or a hat. I love hats.
-Great.

205
00:15:57.333 --> 00:16:00.166
Does anyone know where the tent is?
The Fortune Teller!

206
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.291
-Have you seen a tent?
-…an elephant.

207
00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:06.291
An elephant? What? Wait. wait. wait!

208
00:16:06.375 --> 00:16:08.583
Did you say elephant? Where is she?

209
00:16:08.666 --> 00:16:10.875
They locked her up. And the Magician too.

210
00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:13.416
It's just as she said.

211
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.916
Who did? What?

212
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.458
The elephant has come.

213
00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:20.958
-And what that means is my sister lives!

214
00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:23.916
She lives! She lives. Mrs. Taylor!

215
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.583
Oh. lovely!

216
00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:30.541
The elephant is here!

217
00:16:31.666 --> 00:16:34.291
-The elephant is here!

218
00:16:38.375 --> 00:16:39.750
Ha!

219
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.500
An elephant?

220
00:16:47.583 --> 00:16:50.166
The elephant is here!

221
00:16:51.875 --> 00:16:53.583
-An elephant--
-An elephant!

222
00:16:53.666 --> 00:16:56.833
-Yes. an elephant! An elephant!
-An elephant!

223
00:16:56.916 --> 00:16:59.541
I knew it would come!

224
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.416
-I knew it would come.
-You did?

225
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.916
No. but I had strong
and unreasonable hopes.

226
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.875
And sometimes that's enough.

227
00:17:10.625 --> 00:17:14.750
She's locked up somewhere.
but I have to get her. sir.

228
00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:20.125
I'll barter or sneak
or fight my way in somehow.

229
00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:22.208
Yes. Yes.

230
00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.333
But would you allow me to help?

231
00:17:25.416 --> 00:17:26.958
But… how?

232
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:29.166
I'll speak to the Countess
and her advisers.

233
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:34.375
and you and I will…
We'll figure it out together.

234
00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:36.125
Really?

235
00:17:36.708 --> 00:17:37.583
Really.

236
00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:39.500
Sergeant Lutz?

237
00:17:40.416 --> 00:17:41.625
Sir!

238
00:17:41.708 --> 00:17:43.083
Sergeant Lutz!

239
00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:44.958
Sir!

240
00:17:45.041 --> 00:17:47.958
Elephants? Fairy tales? False hope!

241
00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:51.791
No.

242
00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:53.000
What?

243
00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:56.250
No. sir. An elephant has arrived here!

244
00:17:56.333 --> 00:17:58.916
-An elephant!
-An elephant will do you no good!

245
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.333
But it must be true. then!
My sister lives!

246
00:18:02.416 --> 00:18:04.000
And I remember her.

247
00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.500
Impossible! She died at birth.

248
00:18:06.583 --> 00:18:08.458
No! I remember.

249
00:18:15.291 --> 00:18:16.250
Sir.

250
00:18:17.666 --> 00:18:19.291
have you ever lied to me?

251
00:18:19.375 --> 00:18:20.583
What are you saying?

252
00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:25.000
I'm saying she lives and I will find her.

253
00:18:41.166 --> 00:18:42.000
Mm.

254
00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:46.166
Yes.

255
00:18:48.125 --> 00:18:49.375
Okay.

256
00:18:49.458 --> 00:18:52.000
and… open!

257
00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:55.958
Oh. what the…?

258
00:18:58.666 --> 00:19:01.833
So. liberty!

259
00:19:04.833 --> 00:19:07.125
That's unhelpful.

260
00:19:16.291 --> 00:19:18.916
-You. sir! Why did you do this to me?
-Now. please--

261
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
-I didn't!
-Oh. you most certainly did!

262
00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:23.750
-You brought me on stage!
-It was an accident.

263
00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:27.166
{\an8}Balderdash! You purposely
crushed my leg with an elephant!

264
00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.291
No! It was… It was supposed to be…

265
00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:33.625
Lilies. Yeah. that's it.

266
00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:36.166
-A bouquet of lilies.
-Hey! What is all this?

267
00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.541
No idea! It's outrageous!
Remove it at once.

268
00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:42.375
Stand back. sorcerer!

269
00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:45.125
-I'm just an entertainer!

270
00:19:45.208 --> 00:19:47.000
I am not entertained.

271
00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:49.291
-They're only tricks.
-Assault.

272
00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:54.666
How could I produce an elephant on purpose
when I can't even escape from a jail cell?

273
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.625
Look. Freedom!

274
00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:02.083
-Lima beans. my least favorite legume.

275
00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:04.750
You're behind bars where you belong.

276
00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:08.583
-I'm going to make sure you stay there.

277
00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:18.333
Chest up. shoulders back. Breathe.

278
00:20:18.916 --> 00:20:23.208
Direct. but polite.
Strong. but respectful.

279
00:20:28.333 --> 00:20:30.083
Sweaty and nauseous.

280
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:36.250
The Countess. she's fair and wise.

281
00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:38.916
and no one can remember
the last time she laughed.

282
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.375
-She can sing!
-Can she sing?

283
00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:43.250
Shh. Yes. Captain Matienne?

284
00:20:44.125 --> 00:20:46.500
Thank you. Countess.

285
00:20:46.583 --> 00:20:48.833
I've come to ask
where the elephant is kept.

286
00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:50.166
Who sent you to ask?

287
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.750
Have you been approached
by a foreign power?

288
00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:55.791
No. As captain of the palace guards.
I need to know.

289
00:20:55.875 --> 00:20:59.208
The elephant is dangerous.
We don't even know where it came from.

290
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:02.416
The elephant is a criminal.
it is being treated as such.

291
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.708
A criminal? No.

292
00:21:03.791 --> 00:21:06.416
-This may just be the opening barrage.
-Uh. what?

293
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.000
We must expect other beasts
to be launched at us!

294
00:21:09.083 --> 00:21:12.375
-Camels! Cassowaries! Crocodiles!

295
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:19.583
We commanded the Magician
to disappear her! He says he's unable!

296
00:21:19.666 --> 00:21:23.500
-As such. we plan to destroy her!

297
00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:25.083
I haven't decided that.

298
00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:29.125
If a boy throws a rock through a window.
can you blame the rock?

299
00:21:29.208 --> 00:21:31.125
We're speaking of elephants.

300
00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:34.708
-You're speaking of murder!
-The elephant committed a crime!

301
00:21:34.791 --> 00:21:37.791
The elephant is guilty of nothing
except being an elephant!

302
00:21:37.875 --> 00:21:40.416
I'll continue to consider this
until we meet tomorrow.

303
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.083
But let me say. Captain Matienne.

304
00:21:43.666 --> 00:21:46.833
I take the safety
of our town very seriously.

305
00:21:48.208 --> 00:21:51.625
She may need to be… gotten rid of.

306
00:21:51.708 --> 00:21:53.333
-Hear.
-Agreed!

307
00:21:53.416 --> 00:21:54.916
The only sensible solution.

308
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.208
Quite right.

309
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:02.750
Now.
Leo Matienne sees one other way

310
00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:04.208
to keep the elephant alive.

311
00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:05.333
The King.

312
00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:12.250
Ah.

313
00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:14.541
He knows two things…

314
00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:18.708
-Mm. Huh?
-…one. The King has never been to Baltese.

315
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:24.208
…over the palace wall.
landing safely in the moat.

316
00:22:25.041 --> 00:22:27.416
That's impossible! I love it!

317
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.541
Two. The King likes to be entertained.

318
00:22:30.625 --> 00:22:33.041
-Only to be entertained…

319
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.791
-…and never to not be entertained.

320
00:22:35.875 --> 00:22:37.625
I love you. sir!

321
00:22:37.708 --> 00:22:40.000
Hey. who wants a nougat? You like nougat?

322
00:22:40.083 --> 00:22:43.916
And a doctor. And then they'll go again.
Fantastic stuff.

323
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.000
"An elephant came through a ceiling
and hit an old lady."

324
00:22:51.083 --> 00:22:54.041
Are you kidding? Let's go!

325
00:22:57.666 --> 00:22:58.500
The King!

326
00:22:59.083 --> 00:23:01.083
His Majesty wants…

327
00:23:01.708 --> 00:23:02.708
…to see the elephant!

328
00:23:02.791 --> 00:23:04.458
-The… The King?
-Coming here?

329
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:06.875
-To see the elephant?
-Extraordinary!

330
00:23:06.958 --> 00:23:09.916
-We must make preparations!
-Etcetera!

331
00:23:38.916 --> 00:23:42.416
-Peter. what are you doing?
-Mr. Matienne?

332
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.291
I was going to come get you.

333
00:23:44.375 --> 00:23:46.333
I said I'd help you see the elephant.

334
00:23:46.416 --> 00:23:49.041
Oh. uh. I guess I just…

335
00:23:50.291 --> 00:23:52.458
I… I'm just not used to that.

336
00:23:53.458 --> 00:23:54.291
Help.

337
00:23:55.625 --> 00:23:56.500
Come on.

338
00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:01.750
Whoa.

339
00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:08.583
Wow! You work here?

340
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.250
-That's for the elephant?
-Mm.

341
00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:14.291
Captain Matienne. is everything ready?

342
00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:20.000
Yes. yes!

343
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:23.125
That's right! I'm The King!

344
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:25.583
Ooh!

345
00:24:25.666 --> 00:24:28.750
Hey. everybody's here!

346
00:24:28.833 --> 00:24:30.291
There's snacks!

347
00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:33.625
Oh. this is the best. right?

348
00:24:34.541 --> 00:24:38.791
I know! I know!
I wish I'd been there.

349
00:24:38.875 --> 00:24:39.750
Oh!

350
00:24:41.041 --> 00:24:43.625
Psst. Hey. it's her.

351
00:24:43.708 --> 00:24:46.125
-Hear. hear.

352
00:24:47.666 --> 00:24:51.083
And now. the elephant.

353
00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:09.083
Ha!

354
00:25:19.125 --> 00:25:20.291
You're here!

355
00:25:20.375 --> 00:25:22.041
-Wow!
-Ooh!

356
00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:23.541
My word!

357
00:25:28.958 --> 00:25:31.083
The sheer dimension of her!

358
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.416
Wow. Would you look at that.

359
00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:39.375
I must admit.
she is a magnificent creature.

360
00:25:39.458 --> 00:25:40.541
She certainly is.

361
00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:47.125
-She seems agitated.

362
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.916
Something's not right.

363
00:25:55.083 --> 00:25:56.375
Her eye.

364
00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:03.791
-Can those chains hold her?

365
00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:13.000
Protect them!

366
00:26:18.958 --> 00:26:21.500
Shoot it! Shoot it!

367
00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:25.250
No! No!

368
00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:27.166
No!

369
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.416
Rifles down! Peter.

370
00:26:50.666 --> 00:26:53.291
-Peter!
-I'm okay. I'm okay.

371
00:26:58.875 --> 00:27:00.083
It's okay.

372
00:27:03.125 --> 00:27:04.291
Come.

373
00:27:11.875 --> 00:27:15.708
It's okay. It's okay.

374
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.666
Hey.

375
00:28:29.083 --> 00:28:30.958
-You did it!
-Oh my God!

376
00:28:35.916 --> 00:28:36.875
Young man.

377
00:28:36.958 --> 00:28:38.916
Peter. ma'am.

378
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.958
Peter. I'm grateful.

379
00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:44.208
I'd like you to stay at the palace
and tend to my elephant.

380
00:28:44.291 --> 00:28:46.500
The elephant is staying here?

381
00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:52.833
No. thank you. ma'am.

382
00:28:52.916 --> 00:28:56.625
-Oh.
-The kid's got pluck. I love it!

383
00:28:56.708 --> 00:29:01.166
I need the elephant to lead me
to my lost sister. It is my destiny.

384
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.000
"Destiny."

385
00:29:05.208 --> 00:29:07.541
I must ask you to give her to me.

386
00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:11.250
The elephant is very dangerous. Peter.
That's impossible.

387
00:29:11.333 --> 00:29:14.625
I happen to like impossible things.

388
00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:19.916
Hey. what if Peter
does three impossible things

389
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.291
in exchange for one?

390
00:29:21.375 --> 00:29:23.000
We're here for three days.

391
00:29:23.083 --> 00:29:26.083
Each day. I'll pick something
impossible for the kid to do.

392
00:29:26.166 --> 00:29:30.375
and if he does all three. thus proving
his valor. strength. blah blah blah.

393
00:29:30.458 --> 00:29:32.375
he gets the elephant.

394
00:29:32.458 --> 00:29:34.500
If not. I'll take it back with me.

395
00:29:34.583 --> 00:29:36.625
Well. I'm not sure--

396
00:29:36.708 --> 00:29:39.875
It's a deal!
You're terrific. Countess.

397
00:29:39.958 --> 00:29:43.583
I like this place more and more.
wherever we are.

398
00:29:43.666 --> 00:29:48.250
Okay. the first impossible task is…

399
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.291
a fight!

400
00:29:54.041 --> 00:29:55.916
-A fight?
-Sure!

401
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.958
Who doesn't like a fight?

402
00:29:58.041 --> 00:30:00.583
And an impossible fight
is the best kind. right?

403
00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:03.583
-Stands to reason. sir.
-The kid's up for it! I told you.

404
00:30:03.666 --> 00:30:05.958
Right? He's got some idea
about the elephant.

405
00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:07.708
-And destiny and…
-Uh…

406
00:30:07.791 --> 00:30:12.916
I love it! Okay. tomorrow. noon.
the kid fights my toughest soldier.

407
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.500
-Oh no.

408
00:30:14.583 --> 00:30:16.500
-Pistols or sabers?
-Um--

409
00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:20.083
Sabers it is! I love this kid!
Give him my saber. Henri.

410
00:30:20.583 --> 00:30:21.750
It's all yours.

411
00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:26.625
Unless you get killed. in which case.
you know. I'll take it back.

412
00:30:26.708 --> 00:30:29.541
Peter. has any of your training
included sabers?

413
00:30:29.625 --> 00:30:32.583
-No. sir. Broomsticks a bit.
-Mm…

414
00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:36.166
Meet me at the store. if you like.
I'll try to teach you.

415
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.875
Tomorrow. at noon.

416
00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:46.333
Coup d'arrêt!

417
00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.375
Dérobement!

418
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.875
Yes!

419
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:51.875
En garde!

420
00:30:53.666 --> 00:30:56.250
-Lunge!

421
00:30:56.958 --> 00:30:57.958
Mm-hmm.

422
00:30:58.791 --> 00:30:59.916
Counter-parry!

423
00:31:04.458 --> 00:31:06.416
Yes!

424
00:31:07.708 --> 00:31:09.416
-I'm getting better.
-Absolutely.

425
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.583
Oh. madness. How can the boy win?

426
00:31:12.083 --> 00:31:13.083
What if he does?

427
00:31:13.166 --> 00:31:14.583
What if?

428
00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:17.291
Your "what ifs" will be
the end of us. Leo Matienne.

429
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.958
I beg your pardon. ma'am. But how can
two small words be so dangerous?

430
00:31:23.041 --> 00:31:25.583
In Leo Matienne's hands is how.

431
00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:29.541
What if we put all our savings
into raising pygmy goats?

432
00:31:29.625 --> 00:31:31.500
A perfect pet.

433
00:31:31.583 --> 00:31:34.833
If they could've been trained
not to eat floors and walls.

434
00:31:34.916 --> 00:31:38.208
What if we import rare goods
from the Far East?

435
00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:39.166
Would've worked.

436
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.875
If the entire shipment
had not been eaten by pygmy goats.

437
00:31:41.958 --> 00:31:43.333
They didn't eat the silks.

438
00:31:43.416 --> 00:31:45.250
Ah-ha! Yes. the silk.

439
00:31:45.333 --> 00:31:47.125
You see this roll of silk?

440
00:31:47.208 --> 00:31:49.208
My husband wanted to use it
to kill himself.

441
00:31:49.291 --> 00:31:52.791
It's called a parachute.
and there is evidence it can work.

442
00:31:52.875 --> 00:31:54.583
-Has it ever worked?
-No.

443
00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:57.500
Actually. the results have been
quite grisly. That's true.

444
00:31:57.583 --> 00:31:59.125
But what if I had been the first?

445
00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:07.375
I'm going to practice on the mannequins.

446
00:32:12.666 --> 00:32:14.291
A good boy.

447
00:32:14.375 --> 00:32:15.625
Whoa! Whoa!

448
00:32:19.666 --> 00:32:20.833
Tireless and kind.

449
00:32:21.333 --> 00:32:23.750
-Leo…
-But with no one to love him.

450
00:32:25.166 --> 00:32:26.250
Don't say it.

451
00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:29.875
And the two of us downstairs. all alone.

452
00:32:29.958 --> 00:32:33.541
No. we've tried and failed.

453
00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:36.916
God does not intend for us
to have children. Leo Matienne.

454
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.458
And who are we to say what God intends?

455
00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:41.125
Please.

456
00:32:41.208 --> 00:32:43.333
My heart has been broken too many times.

457
00:32:43.416 --> 00:32:45.500
It cannot bear your foolish questions.

458
00:32:45.583 --> 00:32:50.791
But how? How will the world ever change
if we do not question it?

459
00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:53.291
The world cannot be changed.

460
00:32:53.375 --> 00:32:56.416
The world is what the world is
and forever has been.

461
00:32:58.416 --> 00:32:59.291
No.

462
00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:01.375
I won't believe that.

463
00:33:03.166 --> 00:33:05.708
For here is Peter. standing before us.

464
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:08.750
asking us to make it something different.

465
00:33:10.583 --> 00:33:11.416
Lunge.

466
00:33:12.208 --> 00:33:13.083
Coup d'arrêt.

467
00:33:40.916 --> 00:33:43.166
Oh. Adele. my dear!

468
00:33:43.833 --> 00:33:46.833
-Are you well?
-I dreamt of an elephant. Sister.

469
00:33:46.916 --> 00:33:49.541
Oh. but how lovely.

470
00:33:49.625 --> 00:33:53.416
I find elephant dreams
particularly moving and portentous.

471
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:58.833
although I'm forced to admit that
I myself have never dreamt of an elephant.

472
00:33:58.916 --> 00:34:01.833
It felt like the elephant
came to take me somewhere.

473
00:34:01.916 --> 00:34:06.958
Oh. but you belong right here.
dear child. where you're safe.

474
00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:10.000
Hmm. Safe from what. Sister?

475
00:34:10.541 --> 00:34:11.791
From the world.

476
00:34:11.875 --> 00:34:16.708
I went out to see the world. Adele.
and it was cruel.

477
00:34:16.791 --> 00:34:19.458
So I brought you home to the orphanage.

478
00:34:19.541 --> 00:34:21.791
far away from everything.

479
00:34:21.875 --> 00:34:25.791
And I named you Adele after your mother.

480
00:34:25.875 --> 00:34:28.333
who's in heaven now with your brother.

481
00:34:28.416 --> 00:34:31.666
Mm. Do you think elephants have names?

482
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:34.916
Oh. yes. All creatures have names. dear.

483
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.791
Every last one of them.

484
00:34:50.125 --> 00:34:52.166
The elephant also has dreams.

485
00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:07.958
The elephant's with her family…

486
00:35:10.958 --> 00:35:13.083
and she hears her name spoken.

487
00:35:17.166 --> 00:35:20.458
Somewhere she's known.
somewhere she's loved.

488
00:35:55.833 --> 00:35:58.416
She definitely doesn't belong here.

489
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.000
It all seems impossible.

490
00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:24.625
Hey.

491
00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:27.791
-It's all right. it's okay.

492
00:36:28.458 --> 00:36:29.458
It's all right.

493
00:36:30.875 --> 00:36:33.708
We met earlier. with the water.

494
00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.083
Yeah. that was me.

495
00:36:36.666 --> 00:36:39.250
You may not know it yet. but…

496
00:36:39.333 --> 00:36:41.750
you've been brought here
to find my sister.

497
00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:44.125
Uh. I don't know where she is.

498
00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:48.458
To win you. I have to fight
The King's toughest soldier tomorrow.

499
00:36:53.458 --> 00:36:56.375
But I thought instead.

500
00:36:56.458 --> 00:36:59.916
all you have to do
is just point on this map

501
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.708
and show me where my sister is.

502
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.166
On… on the map.

503
00:37:08.166 --> 00:37:10.916
Show me on this map here where she is.

504
00:37:11.833 --> 00:37:12.916
-Okay?

505
00:37:13.583 --> 00:37:14.916
All right.

506
00:37:20.791 --> 00:37:23.750
Just gotta point where…

507
00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:27.666
Point where my sister is.

508
00:37:41.208 --> 00:37:44.083
Are you a magic talking elephant?

509
00:37:44.166 --> 00:37:46.416
Can you tell me where she is?

510
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.791
Can you speak? Just speak. Say it.

511
00:37:50.666 --> 00:37:51.500
Say it.

512
00:37:52.583 --> 00:37:54.375
Can you say it?

513
00:37:57.666 --> 00:37:59.541
Hey!

514
00:38:13.208 --> 00:38:14.083
Well…

515
00:38:16.541 --> 00:38:18.458
Looks like I have to fight tomorrow.

516
00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:21.833
-So. I better keep practicing.

517
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:51.833
Thank you.

518
00:39:10.083 --> 00:39:11.083
What's happening?

519
00:39:11.166 --> 00:39:13.583
There's a boy fighting for the elephant.

520
00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:37.458
It's time.

521
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:42.791
She lives.

522
00:39:50.291 --> 00:39:51.458
Peter!

523
00:39:51.541 --> 00:39:55.666
Peter. posta breve then moulinet!
Remember. with the spin!

524
00:40:05.833 --> 00:40:08.291
And now. your opponent.

525
00:40:23.791 --> 00:40:25.083
Oh no.

526
00:40:26.458 --> 00:40:27.958
Oh. brilliant!

527
00:40:28.041 --> 00:40:30.500
This is Sergeant De Smedt!

528
00:40:31.208 --> 00:40:32.958
Huh? De Smedt?

529
00:40:35.916 --> 00:40:37.791
-A chase!

530
00:40:37.875 --> 00:40:39.916
Even better!

531
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:50.750
Whoa. whoa. whoa!

532
00:40:59.125 --> 00:41:01.291
Oh.

533
00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:09.875
What do I do? Think!

534
00:41:11.458 --> 00:41:13.708
De Smedt. have you got the boy?

535
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:15.791
De Smedt?

536
00:41:15.875 --> 00:41:19.833
Romain De Smedt.
young soldier I served with.

537
00:41:20.666 --> 00:41:22.333
-I need his book!

538
00:41:47.625 --> 00:41:49.083
-Oh no!

539
00:41:53.958 --> 00:41:55.166
Mm?

540
00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:08.958
Psst!

541
00:42:09.041 --> 00:42:11.250
I need the biggest fish you have. sir!

542
00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:13.041
-Peter?

543
00:42:13.125 --> 00:42:15.708
-What are you doing--?
-Take this as payment.

544
00:42:15.791 --> 00:42:16.625
Cod!

545
00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:20.083
Magnificent and versatile!
-Please!

546
00:42:20.166 --> 00:42:22.833
-Oh no!

547
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:24.708
-Thanks!
-Oh!

548
00:42:26.666 --> 00:42:27.625
Yes!

549
00:42:38.583 --> 00:42:41.333
Whoa!

550
00:42:50.333 --> 00:42:52.000
I think I lost him.

551
00:42:52.083 --> 00:42:54.583
-I definitely haven't lost him!

552
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.791
-Cod!

553
00:43:12.875 --> 00:43:14.666
Magnificent and versatile.

554
00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:22.125
Stiffen the wicks.

555
00:43:22.958 --> 00:43:24.708
The situation has escalated.

556
00:43:25.416 --> 00:43:27.291
There's a clear command structure.

557
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.666
I must find a way
to infiltrate their ranks.

558
00:43:39.166 --> 00:43:40.291
There he is!

559
00:43:41.291 --> 00:43:43.833
-Sergeant De Smedt!

560
00:43:43.916 --> 00:43:45.916
I'm here. Sergeant De Smedt!

561
00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:50.000
-Sergeant De Smedt!

562
00:43:53.416 --> 00:43:54.541
De Smedt.

563
00:43:54.625 --> 00:43:56.500
Sergeant De Smedt. I'm here!

564
00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.416
What is this?

565
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.500
-Oh!

566
00:44:12.291 --> 00:44:15.458
Peter. you are a solider!

567
00:44:15.541 --> 00:44:17.333
Remember our training!

568
00:44:24.291 --> 00:44:27.416
The book! The book! Look!
The book! The book!

569
00:44:34.875 --> 00:44:36.208
{\an8}

570
00:44:37.083 --> 00:44:37.916
{\an8}Huh?

571
00:44:39.958 --> 00:44:41.500
My book.

572
00:44:43.791 --> 00:44:47.125
{\an8}One great whoosh of magic

573
00:44:47.208 --> 00:44:49.916
{\an8}freed the dragon from his evil spell.

574
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.208
and everyone lived happily ever after.

575
00:44:53.916 --> 00:44:56.916
Well. that's all for tonight.
little carrot.

576
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.583
Mama. please? Just one more.

577
00:45:00.416 --> 00:45:03.125
All right. carrot. Just a teeny.

578
00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.625
What is going on there?

579
00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:17.416
I've done some things.

580
00:45:18.166 --> 00:45:19.708
In combat. I mean.

581
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.541
Do you believe a person can change?

582
00:45:25.041 --> 00:45:28.291
I just beat you
in battle. Sergeant.

583
00:45:29.208 --> 00:45:30.958
I think anything's possible.

584
00:45:37.875 --> 00:45:39.791
Yeah. Peter!

585
00:45:39.875 --> 00:45:42.958
-Hooray!

586
00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:45.750
Yay! Peter!

587
00:45:45.833 --> 00:45:47.750
-Yeah!
-Yay!

588
00:46:08.541 --> 00:46:10.583
I'm kind of amazed that worked.

589
00:46:10.666 --> 00:46:12.250
Me too.

590
00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:21.083
You've done the first impossible task.

591
00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:23.708
You've also lost my priceless family saber

592
00:46:23.791 --> 00:46:26.208
and ruined a perfectly good
killing machine.

593
00:46:26.291 --> 00:46:30.583
"Hello." said Mr. Pig.
"Hello." said Mr. Rooster.

594
00:46:30.666 --> 00:46:35.708
You're a surprisingly weird
and dangerous young man.

595
00:46:35.791 --> 00:46:38.208
-And I like that.
-Thank you. sir.

596
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.750
Now. tomorrow.
for the second impossible task…

597
00:46:46.416 --> 00:46:49.000
Uh…

598
00:46:55.041 --> 00:46:56.833
Uh. you will fly!

599
00:46:56.916 --> 00:46:59.583
-Huh? Fly? I… But…
-Fly?

600
00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:03.500
-How?
-Hello? It's supposed to be impossible.

601
00:47:04.375 --> 00:47:07.333
The kid just beat Goliath.
You want him to bob for apples?

602
00:47:07.416 --> 00:47:09.666
Plus. we've had some people nearly fly.

603
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:10.833
What? I…

604
00:47:10.916 --> 00:47:12.541
-Right? Nearly.

605
00:47:16.708 --> 00:47:17.875
Okay. great.

606
00:47:17.958 --> 00:47:20.333
Tomorrow at noon.
we'll all meet in the square

607
00:47:20.416 --> 00:47:23.500
and watch the kid fly or crash or both.

608
00:47:23.583 --> 00:47:25.083
Both could be funny.

609
00:47:25.166 --> 00:47:28.416
Like. like he really gets going
but then. whammo!

610
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.166
No. of course not. No. Um…

611
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.083
So. until then…

612
00:48:07.416 --> 00:48:11.958
I will get you water.
and then I will learn how to fly

613
00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:14.833
and then I will get you out of here.

614
00:48:14.916 --> 00:48:17.333
And we can find my sister.

615
00:48:17.416 --> 00:48:20.166
The elephant cannot
understand human speech.

616
00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:24.041
but she can look at a face
and recognize friendship.

617
00:48:24.125 --> 00:48:25.666
She doesn't feel well.

618
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:29.666
but she does finally
feel something like… hope.

619
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.041
And hope can spread
from one person to the next.

620
00:48:37.125 --> 00:48:41.000
-He ran off like lightning!
-I know! I saw it with my own eyes.

621
00:48:41.083 --> 00:48:44.333
He bestowed upon me this sword
in exchange for one cod.

622
00:48:44.416 --> 00:48:46.625
I can't wait to see
what he has to do next.

623
00:48:46.708 --> 00:48:48.708
I'm going early to get a good spot.

624
00:48:48.791 --> 00:48:51.666
He held up a book!
-Like an avenging librarian!

625
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:55.375
-Incredible! Who knows what's next?
-It could be anything.

626
00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:13.833
An elephant!

627
00:49:16.875 --> 00:49:19.875
Sister! Sister! It's… an elephant!

628
00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:21.250
In the hydrangeas?

629
00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:22.708
In the city!

630
00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:26.250
An elephant has appeared
under miraculous circumstances.

631
00:49:26.833 --> 00:49:27.833
We must go!

632
00:49:27.916 --> 00:49:31.458
No. no. no. no! We do not go to the city.

633
00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:34.208
It is unsafe. Some harm could befall you.

634
00:49:34.291 --> 00:49:37.291
But… my dream. This is a sign.

635
00:49:37.375 --> 00:49:40.125
I do not believe in signs.

636
00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:41.583
Yes. you do.

637
00:49:42.333 --> 00:49:43.500
Yes.

638
00:49:43.583 --> 00:49:46.208
I do. in fact. believe in signs.

639
00:49:47.958 --> 00:49:48.833
Very well. dear.

640
00:49:48.916 --> 00:49:51.875
-Oh!

641
00:49:51.958 --> 00:49:56.625
Perhaps you do not understand.
My legs were crushed!

642
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.000
By an elephant!

643
00:49:59.083 --> 00:50:01.583
Yes. she comes here every day.

644
00:50:01.666 --> 00:50:03.416
Every day.

645
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.166
Every day.

646
00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:07.916
Oh. look who's back.

647
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.166
-Traitor.

648
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:12.250
-My legs were crushed!
-Go get help. boy.

649
00:50:12.333 --> 00:50:13.666
By an elephant!

650
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:17.625
I know. your legs were crushed
by an elephant.

651
00:50:17.708 --> 00:50:19.500
But for the last time.

652
00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:22.791
I just intended a bouquet of lilies.

653
00:50:22.875 --> 00:50:26.250
Just admit you crushed my legs
with your tricks.

654
00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:30.500
It was an accident.
I intended a bouquet of lilies.

655
00:50:31.083 --> 00:50:32.083
Lilies!

656
00:50:34.125 --> 00:50:36.541
Lilies!

657
00:50:38.875 --> 00:50:42.125
Stop all that! Just stop!

658
00:50:57.958 --> 00:50:59.333
Peter…

659
00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:05.208
Peter. Peter. just stop.
Stop this minute!

660
00:51:05.291 --> 00:51:09.375
-Sir--
-Soldiers do not fly! I forbid it!

661
00:51:09.458 --> 00:51:10.791
-Sir. I--
-No!

662
00:51:10.875 --> 00:51:12.458
Now. you listen.

663
00:51:13.458 --> 00:51:15.458
With De Smedt. you were lucky.

664
00:51:15.541 --> 00:51:18.625
but this… this flying…

665
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.708
It is impossible.

666
00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:24.875
I beat De Smedt. and I believe I will fly!

667
00:51:24.958 --> 00:51:27.916
And I believe
you will be crushed flat. Dead.

668
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.083
Dead like your sister!

669
00:51:33.791 --> 00:51:35.500
Huh? Oh…

670
00:51:36.916 --> 00:51:38.458
-Watch me!

671
00:52:03.333 --> 00:52:04.916
Peter. what's wrong?

672
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.750
I have to fly tomorrow.

673
00:52:07.833 --> 00:52:09.916
but I have no idea how to do that.

674
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.500
Vilna says that I'm going to die.

675
00:52:12.583 --> 00:52:13.875
Like I don't know!

676
00:52:13.958 --> 00:52:16.208
Like I don't already know.

677
00:52:16.291 --> 00:52:20.041
I have to fly tomorrow. I have to.

678
00:52:23.083 --> 00:52:24.875
Come inside. You need to eat.

679
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:26.833
And we'll talk.

680
00:52:32.375 --> 00:52:33.291
Eat now.

681
00:53:02.166 --> 00:53:03.833
What do you call this?

682
00:53:04.791 --> 00:53:06.000
Stew. dear.

683
00:53:34.875 --> 00:53:38.000
Okay. Peter.
now. about this flying business.

684
00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:40.708
Please. stay close. dear.

685
00:53:46.791 --> 00:53:47.708
-Hello. honey.

686
00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:49.625
As soon as you see the elephant.

687
00:53:49.708 --> 00:53:52.791
we're going back to the orphanage
where we're safe.

688
00:53:53.291 --> 00:53:55.875
-Help you with your luggage. Sister?
-Oh!

689
00:53:55.958 --> 00:53:58.875
-Quickly. dear. Quickly.

690
00:53:59.708 --> 00:54:02.916
Now you see why
we don't travel to the city. Adele.

691
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.333
Danger at every turn.

692
00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:18.416
Peter.

693
00:54:25.541 --> 00:54:27.791
Peter. where are you?

694
00:54:34.166 --> 00:54:36.416
Hello? Hello?

695
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:39.083
If only I'd kept the boy. The boy.

696
00:54:40.333 --> 00:54:42.791
-We're retreating to the garrison.

697
00:54:51.875 --> 00:54:52.833
Oh.

698
00:54:52.916 --> 00:54:54.416
Regroup at the garrison!

699
00:54:56.125 --> 00:54:58.875
Go! Go! Go. go!

700
00:54:58.958 --> 00:55:00.625
-Run!

701
00:55:01.333 --> 00:55:02.708
Retreat!

702
00:55:06.083 --> 00:55:07.333
Fall back!

703
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.500
Hello? Hello?

704
00:55:18.041 --> 00:55:20.166
Please. listen.
You have to get out of here.

705
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:22.208
We're retreating to the garrison.

706
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:24.541
Their mother. is she--?

707
00:55:26.416 --> 00:55:28.916
Take the children. I'll meet you there.

708
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.750
I'm a soldier.
I don't know how to care for a newborn.

709
00:55:32.833 --> 00:55:34.916
Of course. Just the boy. then.

710
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.166
Please. I can't do it alone.

711
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.500
All right. But you have to leave at once.

712
00:55:39.583 --> 00:55:43.958
I'll gather things for the baby
and meet you at the garrison. Now. go!

713
00:55:53.875 --> 00:55:55.708
I should have taken them both.

714
00:55:57.958 --> 00:55:59.666
I'm so sorry. young man.

715
00:56:00.541 --> 00:56:02.166
But I'll keep you safe.

716
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:03.250
I'm a soldier.

717
00:56:21.041 --> 00:56:22.083
Peter.

718
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.791
Oh. the boy with me.

719
00:56:34.708 --> 00:56:36.416
The garrison!

720
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:38.125
Is there anyone left?

721
00:56:38.208 --> 00:56:40.083
No more survivors!

722
00:56:40.166 --> 00:56:43.166
It's not safe here. Sister!
The enemy is coming!

723
00:56:47.666 --> 00:56:50.041
If only I'd kept the boy with me.

724
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:11.500
-A new day.
-Hey. everybody! Hello!

725
00:57:11.583 --> 00:57:13.708
A new impossible task.

726
00:57:14.375 --> 00:57:17.000
And the same impossible King.

727
00:57:18.375 --> 00:57:22.791
Great day to watch the kid fly. eh?
Not a cloud in the…

728
00:57:23.958 --> 00:57:25.666
Oh. strike that.

729
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:28.916
It's a shame. really.

730
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.708
because. you know. with a tan…

731
00:57:31.791 --> 00:57:34.208
…I become irresistible.

732
00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:42.791
I'm still King. right?
I didn't miss a coup or something.

733
00:57:48.791 --> 00:57:50.083
Does she ever laugh?

734
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.166
Never?

735
00:57:53.833 --> 00:57:56.291
Like. not ever?

736
00:57:56.375 --> 00:57:59.083
Not since her brother died in the war.

737
00:58:04.375 --> 00:58:05.291
Oh dear.

738
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Yeah!

739
00:58:24.083 --> 00:58:27.583
They said the elephant would be here.
Can you see her. Sister?

740
00:58:29.083 --> 00:58:30.541
-Ooh!

741
00:58:34.041 --> 00:58:36.750
-Stay close. dear.

742
00:58:38.208 --> 00:58:40.625
-No. stay with me! Stay with me!

743
00:58:42.958 --> 00:58:44.875
How's everybody doing?

744
00:58:44.958 --> 00:58:48.083
Yes. it's me!

745
00:58:49.083 --> 00:58:53.375
Okay. Let's see something impossible.
Uh. where's the kid?

746
00:58:53.458 --> 00:58:54.583
Up there!

747
00:59:10.333 --> 00:59:12.916
Well. that doesn't seem smart.

748
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:16.916
-He'll be all right.
-Uh-huh. Yes. sure.

749
00:59:20.333 --> 00:59:21.250
Ooh.

750
00:59:32.583 --> 00:59:34.250
No. no. no. no. no.

751
00:59:36.583 --> 00:59:38.250
Whoa.

752
00:59:54.541 --> 00:59:56.083
Whoa!

753
00:59:56.166 --> 00:59:57.708
Ah!

754
00:59:58.833 --> 01:00:01.666
Ahh!

755
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.250
No!

756
01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:10.625
-What is it?
-The boy. he slipped.

757
01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:11.625
No!

758
01:00:13.875 --> 01:00:14.791
Hold on!

759
01:00:32.958 --> 01:00:35.125
-Phew.

760
01:00:52.333 --> 01:00:53.416
-Ugh!

761
01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:54.916
Humph!

762
01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:59.791
And now. I will fly!

763
01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:02.916
He's gonna jump!

764
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.708
This was a fantastic idea!

765
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.416
I will find her.

766
01:01:27.166 --> 01:01:28.041
Now. Peter!

767
01:01:36.458 --> 01:01:38.291
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

768
01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:56.875
-Peter!

769
01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:05.333
Wow.

770
01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:09.958
I knew it!

771
01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:12.041
I knew the kid could fly!

772
01:02:18.208 --> 01:02:20.125
Oh! It's possible!

773
01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:26.500
You are flying. Peter!

774
01:02:26.583 --> 01:02:28.958
You are flying!

775
01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:32.250
What is possible?
It's possible! It's possible!

776
01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:35.000
It's possible! Peter!

777
01:02:39.791 --> 01:02:41.541
He's flying!

778
01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:50.541
Oh!

779
01:02:52.583 --> 01:02:54.000
Whoa!

780
01:02:54.833 --> 01:02:55.750
Peter!

781
01:03:05.125 --> 01:03:08.375
-Sorry! Excuse me!

782
01:03:16.708 --> 01:03:19.333
Peter!

783
01:03:21.958 --> 01:03:24.500
Whoa! Wonderful. Peter!

784
01:03:24.583 --> 01:03:25.708
Ah!

785
01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:31.208
Whoa!

786
01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:34.416
-Yay. Peter! Great job!

787
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:39.416
-Peter! Peter! Peter!

788
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.333
Yeah!

789
01:03:46.416 --> 01:03:48.833
-Yeah!
-Yes! Whoo!

790
01:03:49.416 --> 01:03:52.791
All right. I flew! What's next?

791
01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:55.333
Well. you've done
the second impossible task.

792
01:03:55.416 --> 01:03:59.458
so. you are one step away
from owning an elephant!

793
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:04.166
It doesn't sound great when I say it
out loud. A lot of cleaning up.

794
01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:06.416
-Huge. Anyway. Okay. Good.

795
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:10.541
-Okay. for the third impossible task…

796
01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:15.750
Uh…

797
01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:17.166
I don't have it yet.

798
01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:20.625
No. I'm a spur-of-the-moment
kind of king. you know?

799
01:04:20.708 --> 01:04:25.041
I… I come up with things
on the fly. you know?

800
01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:28.541
Always winging it.

801
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:34.291
It's a joke. God. it's a quip. but…

802
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.041
Aha!

803
01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:42.833
Nope. Nope. Sorry. Stand down. son.

804
01:04:42.916 --> 01:04:46.333
I just get like this when I'm about
to say something incredible.

805
01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:48.791
Okay. kid. you ready?

806
01:04:50.041 --> 01:04:51.708
For your third impossible task…

807
01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:58.166
you will make the Countess laugh.

808
01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:59.458
-What?

809
01:04:59.541 --> 01:05:01.875
-What?

810
01:05:01.958 --> 01:05:02.916
Oh.

811
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.250
They keep doing this.

812
01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:08.000
What part of impossible
is tripping you people up?

813
01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:11.708
Im. not. Poss. the middle part…
Im… Something…

814
01:05:11.791 --> 01:05:13.833
Okay. I have no idea. but it means

815
01:05:13.916 --> 01:05:15.833
"impossible!"

816
01:05:16.416 --> 01:05:17.791
Plus. this kid's a killer.

817
01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:19.833
Anyone thinks they're better
than this kid.

818
01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:22.583
you're next jumping off
the cathedral wearing a tent.

819
01:05:22.666 --> 01:05:23.666
Remember that.

820
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:28.166
You should stop worrying about the kid
and figure out who'll get me an ice cream.

821
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.625
Preferably butter pecan.

822
01:05:31.291 --> 01:05:33.583
Anyone? Hello?
Why are we all standing here?

823
01:05:35.916 --> 01:05:37.875
Oh! Adele!

824
01:05:40.041 --> 01:05:42.375
Oh my goodness.

825
01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:46.500
Hello.

826
01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:52.041
It's me. from the dream. Do you remember?

827
01:05:56.041 --> 01:05:59.416
I'm here. Can you tell me why?

828
01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:06.291
This one may really be impossible.

829
01:06:07.708 --> 01:06:11.208
I mean. she never laughs.

830
01:06:11.291 --> 01:06:12.833
-Not ever.

831
01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:16.083
Maybe they'd let me
jump off the cathedral again.

832
01:06:16.166 --> 01:06:17.583
I could write you a joke.

833
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:19.875
Sorry?

834
01:06:19.958 --> 01:06:22.041
You're probably just not very funny.

835
01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:25.916
Right. and I'm sure you're hilarious.

836
01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.625
-Ow!

837
01:06:29.666 --> 01:06:31.250
Ow.

838
01:06:31.333 --> 01:06:33.166
Very sorry. miss.

839
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.875
It's unlike me
to say something so insulting.

840
01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:38.375
And I've never hit a person in my life.

841
01:06:38.458 --> 01:06:39.625
Please forgive me.

842
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:49.500
-But I--
-Oh. there you are!

843
01:06:49.583 --> 01:06:51.000
I was looking everywhere.

844
01:06:51.083 --> 01:06:52.375
Are you all right?

845
01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:53.500
Yes. Sister.

846
01:06:54.125 --> 01:06:57.708
Well. now that you've seen the elephant…

847
01:06:59.291 --> 01:07:01.125
-Hello. madam.

848
01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:06.208
Did she tell you anything?

849
01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:09.291
No.

850
01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:11.041
Very good. dear!

851
01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.500
Now we can go home.

852
01:07:12.583 --> 01:07:13.666
But. Sister--

853
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:17.875
We'll get a good night's sleep.
then go back to where we belong.

854
01:07:46.541 --> 01:07:47.375
Hmm.

855
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I get muddled sometimes. Peter.

856
01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:10.250
little unclear about things.

857
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.166
I want you to know

858
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:15.416
I am perfectly clear

859
01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:18.416
what I have to say right now.

860
01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:25.791
You are right.

861
01:08:26.916 --> 01:08:27.916
She was alive.

862
01:08:29.041 --> 01:08:32.041
The little girl was alive.

863
01:08:37.708 --> 01:08:39.250
I could have saved her.

864
01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:41.583
I left her with the nurse.

865
01:08:42.583 --> 01:08:47.708
We were supposed to meet at the garrison.
but there was an explosion.

866
01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:53.000
I… I didn't think
I could tend to you both.

867
01:08:53.083 --> 01:08:54.750
I'm a soldier. Peter.

868
01:08:55.916 --> 01:08:58.500
What do I
know about an infant?

869
01:09:00.166 --> 01:09:02.250
We make these decisions

870
01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.916
in war. in life.

871
01:09:07.541 --> 01:09:09.750
We have only a moment.

872
01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:14.125
I could have saved you both.

873
01:09:16.875 --> 01:09:17.833
I didn't.

874
01:09:19.333 --> 01:09:20.625
And I lied

875
01:09:21.625 --> 01:09:26.250
because I didn't want
to cause you any more pain.

876
01:09:27.416 --> 01:09:29.625
Oh. I'm so sorry.

877
01:09:45.791 --> 01:09:46.791
Sir…

878
01:09:48.791 --> 01:09:51.333
did you see her dead?

879
01:09:52.458 --> 01:09:53.458
My sister?

880
01:09:54.416 --> 01:09:55.375
No.

881
01:09:56.083 --> 01:09:58.166
Then anything is possible.

882
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:01.125
Well…

883
01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:05.791
you spoke of impossible elephants…

884
01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:09.125
and were correct.

885
01:10:09.208 --> 01:10:10.041
Sir?

886
01:10:10.125 --> 01:10:13.208
You stood before an impossible opponent…

887
01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:17.875
and you were victorious.

888
01:10:17.958 --> 01:10:19.500
Then today…

889
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.916
…I saw you fly!

890
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.208
It's you. my boy.

891
01:10:26.291 --> 01:10:27.333
You.

892
01:10:27.416 --> 01:10:30.583
You are what is possible.

893
01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:35.000
One more task tomorrow.

894
01:10:37.583 --> 01:10:40.041
Well. then. tell me a joke.

895
01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:46.208
A horse walked into a bar.
Um. maybe it can't walk into it.

896
01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:48.916
No. no! That's not funny.

897
01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:52.041
-No.

898
01:10:56.333 --> 01:10:57.708
Oh. yes.

899
01:10:59.541 --> 01:11:01.708
Yes!

900
01:11:03.625 --> 01:11:05.166
Yes. that is funny!

901
01:11:20.333 --> 01:11:21.333
Madam LaVaughn.

902
01:11:22.166 --> 01:11:23.208
I've lied to you.

903
01:11:23.291 --> 01:11:24.208
Oh!

904
01:11:24.291 --> 01:11:26.208
Finally. an admission.

905
01:11:26.291 --> 01:11:31.125
No. I didn't mean to hurt you
or make an elephant appear.

906
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:34.041
but I wasn't trying
for a bouquet of lilies either.

907
01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:35.125
Mm.

908
01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.833
When I stood on that stage
facing all of you.

909
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:40.416
your disbelief…

910
01:11:42.833 --> 01:11:46.666
…it… it made my heart break.

911
01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:50.958
Even now. you see magic right before you.

912
01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:53.541
things conjured from nothing.

913
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:59.166
Granted. a fractured magic.
sloppy. accidental. but…

914
01:11:59.875 --> 01:12:01.166
magic.

915
01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:05.500
To which you respond. "Stop."
as you would to some minor nuisance.

916
01:12:06.541 --> 01:12:08.333
What has happened here?

917
01:12:11.333 --> 01:12:15.750
That night. I tried to cast a spell
on you and everyone else there.

918
01:12:15.833 --> 01:12:17.958
A spell to make you believe again.

919
01:12:18.041 --> 01:12:19.875
to care about magic.

920
01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:23.250
because extraordinary things are possible.

921
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.291
If you believe!

922
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:30.708
But I had no business
attempting such a powerful spell.

923
01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:33.750
because I'm not a very good magician.

924
01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:37.416
I tried for mystery and wonderment.

925
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.041
It brought disaster.

926
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:50.750
-I know.

927
01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.125
I know you're worried
about the Countess laughing.

928
01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:56.041
but I've got a great joke.

929
01:12:56.125 --> 01:12:58.750
And I've got it under control.
You gotta trust me.

930
01:13:01.375 --> 01:13:03.625
Hey!

931
01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:09.250
I feel like you're not taking me
seriously. I'm a dangerous man.

932
01:13:09.791 --> 01:13:13.708
-I beat a giant. I jumped off a building.

933
01:13:13.791 --> 01:13:18.166
Okay. okay. There'll be plenty of time
for messing about later.

934
01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:22.416
We just have to concentrate
on the final task. but…

935
01:13:31.375 --> 01:13:33.916
Oh. I can't wait to get you out of here.

936
01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:39.208
We're gonna have so much fun
and so many adventures…

937
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.541
…finding my sister.

938
01:13:44.541 --> 01:13:45.708
-Hmm.

939
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.541
Wow!

940
01:14:09.875 --> 01:14:13.458
Ya!

941
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:22.375
Woo-hoo!

942
01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:27.500
Whoa!

943
01:15:15.416 --> 01:15:18.375
Is this your family?

944
01:15:18.458 --> 01:15:19.833
Peter!

945
01:15:22.458 --> 01:15:23.625
Peter!

946
01:15:23.708 --> 01:15:26.500
-Peter! Peter! Peter!

947
01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:31.333
Peter.

948
01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:33.500
Peter.

949
01:15:33.583 --> 01:15:35.875
Hey. wake up. It's time now.

950
01:15:37.458 --> 01:15:40.791
Everyone's here. Peter. The third task.

951
01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:43.375
Well. this should be interesting.

952
01:15:43.916 --> 01:15:45.333
Oh!

953
01:15:50.458 --> 01:15:55.000
You must really miss them. I thought
you were taking me back to my family.

954
01:15:59.625 --> 01:16:01.791
I need to get you back to yours.

955
01:16:01.875 --> 01:16:06.375
It's time for the third impossible task!

956
01:16:07.166 --> 01:16:11.333
Will the kid finally win
the elephant?

957
01:16:13.541 --> 01:16:15.916
Yes. I will.

958
01:16:19.458 --> 01:16:23.000
Now. if at any point
I hear the Countess laugh.

959
01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:24.958
you walk away with the elephant.

960
01:16:31.083 --> 01:16:32.333
Proceed.

961
01:16:47.416 --> 01:16:50.875
So. there's a farmer and a fisherman.

962
01:16:50.958 --> 01:16:54.083
-They're out in a field together.
-Solid start. Classic.

963
01:16:54.166 --> 01:16:56.750
When they hear
a funny kind of croaking noise.

964
01:16:56.833 --> 01:16:59.833
they look over towards the pond
and they see a hen.

965
01:16:59.916 --> 01:17:02.416
The hen's got this piece of string.

966
01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.208
and she's working the string
in and out of the mouth

967
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:07.125
of a frog by the pond.

968
01:17:07.208 --> 01:17:10.208
up and down with the string
in the frog's mouth.

969
01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:14.375
So. the fisherman says.
"Why do you think the hen's doing that?"

970
01:17:14.458 --> 01:17:16.708
The farmer turns
to the fisherman and says.

971
01:17:16.791 --> 01:17:20.583
"Well. sure. it's the same question
as always. isn't it?"

972
01:17:20.666 --> 01:17:22.541
-Huh? Huh?

973
01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:25.458
"Why did the chicken floss the toad?"

974
01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:29.916
Nailed it!
Funny stuff. Peter! Funny stuff!

975
01:17:38.333 --> 01:17:40.458
Oh. I get it.

976
01:17:40.541 --> 01:17:44.208
Why did the chicken--?
Because it sounds like…

977
01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:48.375
Hold on. Hold on.

978
01:17:48.458 --> 01:17:50.333
That's not a real laugh.

979
01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:54.958
If you're not gonna take this seriously.
Countess. then what's the point?

980
01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:56.625
Sorry. kid. you failed.

981
01:18:00.916 --> 01:18:02.041
Oh. Peter.

982
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:05.833
No.

983
01:18:05.916 --> 01:18:07.750
What? No?

984
01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.208
You have to let me take her.

985
01:18:10.291 --> 01:18:13.000
but not for me. for her.

986
01:18:14.166 --> 01:18:17.708
All this time. I've tried to win
the elephant to find my family.

987
01:18:18.416 --> 01:18:22.083
but she has a family
and she was taken from them.

988
01:18:22.166 --> 01:18:24.416
Peter. what about your sister?

989
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.583
The elephant might have a sister too.

990
01:18:26.666 --> 01:18:28.583
Why is mine more important?

991
01:18:30.041 --> 01:18:32.750
I know the joke didn't work.

992
01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:36.875
but please. the elephant didn't ask
to be brought here.

993
01:18:37.541 --> 01:18:39.666
We have to send her home.

994
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:42.541
No. no. no. no. no. no.

995
01:18:44.166 --> 01:18:46.250
Man. you almost had me.

996
01:18:46.333 --> 01:18:47.416
But no.

997
01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:52.416
You had one last thing to do.
and I don't see her laughing.

998
01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.625
Grab the elephant and we'll roll.

999
01:18:56.625 --> 01:18:59.250
No! No! No!

1000
01:19:05.375 --> 01:19:08.083
Okay. I know. This is impossible.

1001
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.208
But what if it wasn't?

1002
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.541
Just think for a moment.

1003
01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:18.208
Think of all
of the impossible things you've done.

1004
01:19:18.291 --> 01:19:20.250
and you've probably done plenty.

1005
01:19:21.041 --> 01:19:23.583
Have you ever gotten through
one of them alone?

1006
01:19:23.666 --> 01:19:27.208
Of course not. That would be absurd.

1007
01:19:27.291 --> 01:19:30.250
Peter fought and flew and defied a king.

1008
01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:33.041
-and maybe he feels alone.

1009
01:19:33.125 --> 01:19:34.333
But he's not.

1010
01:19:34.416 --> 01:19:36.458
No one is. Remember that.

1011
01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:42.291
Let's go!

1012
01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.500
Oh no.

1013
01:19:56.541 --> 01:19:58.625
I…

1014
01:20:25.041 --> 01:20:26.958
All right. kid. you did it.

1015
01:20:27.041 --> 01:20:29.000
What? Really?

1016
01:20:29.083 --> 01:20:30.875
But… but it was the elephant.

1017
01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:34.916
She's laughing. right?
That's all I really wanted.

1018
01:20:36.666 --> 01:20:40.208
Things are only impossible
till they're not.

1019
01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:43.000
The elephant is yours. Peter.

1020
01:20:43.083 --> 01:20:44.958
What?

1021
01:20:45.583 --> 01:20:48.500
Glorious victory! Huzzah!

1022
01:20:57.541 --> 01:21:01.083
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

1023
01:21:01.166 --> 01:21:03.125
Yeah!

1024
01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.041
Wow.

1025
01:21:11.875 --> 01:21:15.750
We did it! We did it!

1026
01:21:16.958 --> 01:21:22.791
Mm. Whoa. whoa!

1027
01:21:24.416 --> 01:21:26.000
How will we get her home?

1028
01:21:26.083 --> 01:21:27.416
A barge across the sea!

1029
01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:28.333
A dirigible?

1030
01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:31.208
Carried over the mountains
by larger elephants!

1031
01:21:31.291 --> 01:21:33.458
That seemed good until I said it out loud.

1032
01:21:35.125 --> 01:21:37.041
-The Magician!

1033
01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:39.583
-Wake up now.

1034
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.458
This boy says the elephant must go home.

1035
01:21:43.541 --> 01:21:45.375
-You must make her disappear.

1036
01:21:45.958 --> 01:21:48.708
You've seen what happens
when I attempt that spell.

1037
01:21:48.791 --> 01:21:50.708
We're lucky it wasn't worse.

1038
01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:54.333
Sir. the elephant deserves
to be with her family.

1039
01:21:54.416 --> 01:21:58.083
Yeah. that's a lovely idea.
but look around you.

1040
01:21:58.166 --> 01:21:59.875
My magic is all failure!

1041
01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:01.708
-Failure?
-I can't do it!

1042
01:22:01.791 --> 01:22:03.208
Nonsense!

1043
01:22:03.291 --> 01:22:06.708
-You brought an elephant through the roof.

1044
01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:11.291
And don't you realize
it started something here?

1045
01:22:11.375 --> 01:22:13.916
The very thing you wished for.

1046
01:22:17.791 --> 01:22:21.625
Hey. magic man!
Let's send the big lady home!

1047
01:22:23.666 --> 01:22:26.625
I believe that you can perform
the necessary magic.

1048
01:22:27.458 --> 01:22:30.166
I believe that only you
can set things right.

1049
01:22:53.166 --> 01:22:54.500
Sister! Sister!

1050
01:22:55.416 --> 01:22:57.166
Sister. please.

1051
01:22:57.250 --> 01:23:00.166
In my dream. I was meant to follow her.

1052
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.416
I do not believe in dreams.

1053
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:08.125
Yes. you do.

1054
01:23:08.208 --> 01:23:11.791
Yes. I do. in fact. believe in dreams.

1055
01:23:11.875 --> 01:23:14.750
Oh. very well.

1056
01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:35.333
Developments are afoot.

1057
01:23:59.041 --> 01:24:01.958
The battle must be joined.

1058
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.250
Hey. it's okay.

1059
01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:33.333
-It's okay.

1060
01:24:43.041 --> 01:24:45.458
I heard it was different here before.

1061
01:24:45.958 --> 01:24:49.541
There was light.
there was life. there was hope.

1062
01:24:50.541 --> 01:24:54.416
The perfect kind of town
to make an elephant disappear.

1063
01:24:55.250 --> 01:24:57.208
This is my home.

1064
01:24:58.875 --> 01:25:00.208
but it's not hers.

1065
01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:10.500
It's hard to lose a friend.

1066
01:25:15.291 --> 01:25:16.875
We have to say goodbye now.

1067
01:25:21.458 --> 01:25:23.458
The Magician brought her here.

1068
01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:29.083
and I believe that he can send her home!

1069
01:25:31.833 --> 01:25:34.291
Do you believe?

1070
01:25:34.375 --> 01:25:37.708
That is how it will be accomplished.

1071
01:25:41.833 --> 01:25:43.333
Please. sir.

1072
01:26:35.125 --> 01:26:38.000
Belief is a great and invisible thing.

1073
01:26:38.666 --> 01:26:40.791
It comes over us like sleep.

1074
01:26:42.083 --> 01:26:43.791
We struggle along the edges.

1075
01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:46.000
fighting it for reasons we cannot name…

1076
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.625
until. as with sleep.

1077
01:26:50.708 --> 01:26:52.083
we lose ourselves.

1078
01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:56.666
We stop… and we are restored.

1079
01:27:12.041 --> 01:27:14.166
The elephant is gone!

1080
01:27:18.125 --> 01:27:20.583
I can't believe I just saw magic!

1081
01:27:28.375 --> 01:27:31.500
-What's happening?
-Look at the clouds!

1082
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.250
It's magic.

1083
01:27:36.333 --> 01:27:38.500
-It's clearing!

1084
01:27:39.416 --> 01:27:42.541
-What is it?
-It's sun. my darling.

1085
01:27:43.208 --> 01:27:44.250
It's good.

1086
01:27:44.333 --> 01:27:46.375
-It's beautiful!

1087
01:27:49.625 --> 01:27:50.750
Sunshine!

1088
01:27:55.875 --> 01:27:58.791
You were meant to follow her
to your destiny.

1089
01:27:59.958 --> 01:28:01.583
This was more important.

1090
01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:17.958
Come on now. Adele. Time to go home.

1091
01:28:20.875 --> 01:28:22.625
Sir. you're outside!

1092
01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:25.041
-Yes. Yes.

1093
01:28:27.125 --> 01:28:28.125
Oh.

1094
01:28:28.208 --> 01:28:29.416
Oh.

1095
01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:30.750
The soldier?

1096
01:28:30.833 --> 01:28:31.833
You were dead.

1097
01:28:31.916 --> 01:28:33.333
You were dead.

1098
01:28:37.333 --> 01:28:38.333
Do you…?

1099
01:28:39.333 --> 01:28:40.416
Do you mean?

1100
01:28:41.291 --> 01:28:42.916
The boy!

1101
01:28:49.083 --> 01:28:50.208
Peter.

1102
01:28:54.416 --> 01:28:56.625
This is… this is my sister.

1103
01:29:01.958 --> 01:29:03.916
-You're--
-Well…

1104
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.333
-First of all-- Let me just say--
-You're alive! And here!

1105
01:29:07.416 --> 01:29:09.166
-And family!

1106
01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:13.416
Come on. Peter!

1107
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.208
-Incredible!

1108
01:29:17.291 --> 01:29:20.541
Good stuff. Good stuff.

1109
01:29:21.208 --> 01:29:23.166
Oh.

1110
01:29:30.166 --> 01:29:32.541
-Yeah!

1111
01:29:32.625 --> 01:29:34.625
He found her!

1112
01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:39.458
Ow! What was that for?

1113
01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:41.541
No more jumping off buildings!

1114
01:29:49.541 --> 01:29:51.291
The magic worked!

1115
01:30:00.125 --> 01:30:02.791
I'm sorry for the harm
I've caused you. madam.

1116
01:30:03.875 --> 01:30:05.375
I beg your forgiveness.

1117
01:30:11.375 --> 01:30:13.583
Oh. lilies!

1118
01:30:14.291 --> 01:30:16.833
Thank you. my friend.

1119
01:30:27.541 --> 01:30:30.125
Just look at the place now.

1120
01:30:30.208 --> 01:30:33.458
A town restored. Can you see?

1121
01:30:34.916 --> 01:30:36.916
You've been visiting
for a while.

1122
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.625
I know. but every time I try to leave.

1123
01:30:39.708 --> 01:30:43.041
it just seems… impossible.

1124
01:30:43.125 --> 01:30:46.208
Just then. the magic coral woke up

1125
01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:48.583
and chased the oysters away shouting--

1126
01:30:48.666 --> 01:30:51.791
-"Begone. evil mollusks!"

1127
01:30:51.875 --> 01:30:53.208
"Away!"

1128
01:30:53.291 --> 01:30:56.208
-Ooh. that was really scary.
-Thank you.

1129
01:30:58.333 --> 01:31:00.500
A whole family created.

1130
01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:04.208
How do you find exotic yarn?

1131
01:31:04.291 --> 01:31:07.875
Oh. I've got my secrets.
you know? I'm a big city lady.

1132
01:31:07.958 --> 01:31:11.583
Tell me you didn't make the goat
more pajamas. All he does is eat them.

1133
01:31:11.666 --> 01:31:13.583
Yes. but he likes eating pajamas.

1134
01:31:13.666 --> 01:31:15.208
Come on. while it's hot!

1135
01:31:28.791 --> 01:31:31.000
And as for the elephant.

1136
01:31:31.958 --> 01:31:34.208
she lives a really long time.

1137
01:31:34.875 --> 01:31:38.250
long enough to test
even an elephant's memory.

1138
01:31:39.833 --> 01:31:43.750
But of course. she never forgets Peter.

1139
01:31:43.833 --> 01:31:46.083
I mean. how could she?
