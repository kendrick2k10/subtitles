We only borrow everything
till we're 18.

Besides. you have to wait
until after school

one person's "late"

53
00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:21.266
is another person's...
"right on time."

54
00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.435
Uh. hey. Phillip.
How's it going?

55
00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.311
My mom forgot
my dentist appointment.

56
00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:27.147
I definitely did not.

57
00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.273

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.150

No.

63

You'd be helping
me out. actually.

64
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.615
No. it's okay.

65
00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.994

Okay. You know what?

69
00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.167
Yeah. that would
actually be great.

70
00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:48.168
Do you know where
the spare key is?

71
00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.337

Did you remember to schedule
my fitting for...

78
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.518
Before school? I know.

79
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.020
Okay. 'cause I have
that new workshop

80
00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:08.063
with the new instructor...

81
00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.773
After school. I know.

82
00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:11.358
Sorry. Mom.

83
00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.194
It's just the spring showcase
is right around the corner...

84
00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.654
And this
is the most important time

85
00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.906
of your life.

86
00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:19.157
It's crazy
that I've worked so hard

87
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.492
for this long.
and it...

88
00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:24.037
And it all comes down
to one performance.

89
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.955
Believe me... I know.

90
00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.665
[Dad] Ah. yes.

91
00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:29.709
No. I appreciate you putting me
as lead on my case.

92
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.044
Yeah. it was clear
they needed some...

93
00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.588
how do I say. uh.
guidance?

94
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.508
Oh. yes.
Oh. that makes perfect sense.

95
00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.676
Of course.

96
00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.094
[chuckling] Yeah.

97
00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.971
Uh... oh. I'm not sure
Friday will work.

98
00:03:42.013 --> 00:03:43.098
My wife has this weekly...

99
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.933
[hushed]
No. no. no. no. I'll skip it.

100
00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:48.269
On second thought. no.
Friday will be perfect.

101
00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.147
[he gasps quietly]

102
00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.315
This is it. babe.

103
00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:54.150
Jameson would like

104
00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.652
for you and I
to join he and his wife

105
00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:58.071
at Osteria Andretti
Friday night.

106
00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.322
Osteria Andretti?

107
00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:01.324
That's not just
a typical steak dinner.

108
00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:02.951
No. that's partner prime rib.

109
00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.703
-Ah! Ho. ho!
-[laughing]

110
00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:05.912
Oh!

111
00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.664
You know who makes
an even better prime rib?

112
00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.249
Well. of course...

113
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.583
but are you sure?

114
00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:12.460
You want
to impress them. right?

115
00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.587
You're always saying

116
00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.425
Jameson is always talking about
strong family values.

117
00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.552
Why not invite 'em over
for dinner?

118
00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.095
But are you sure about Friday?

119
00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:23.638
How loving are you gonna be

120
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.515
if you miss
another choir rehearsal?

121
00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:27.559
The church choir
will understand.

122
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.229
We are about to be blessed
with two stars in the family...

123
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.691
one. my baby prima ballerina.

124
00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:36.192
and my honey.

125
00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:37.610
a partner

126
00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:40.071
at Jameson. Sloss.
and Keating.

127
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.823
No! No.

129
00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:45.702

00:05:09.476 --> 00:05:11.686
Claire?
We are a fashion house.

137
00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.022
You can't come to work
lookin' like that.

138
00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:16.107
You're tracking water
all through the warehouse.

139
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.359
That's couture.

140
00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:19.778
Okay. look.

141
00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.946
Um. look. the. uh.
accounting firm.

142
00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:25.158
they need those. um...
expenses you were reviewing.

143
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.951
Yes. I am on track
to have it delivered

144
00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.703
by the deadline.

145
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:31.790
Well. they need this
by 11 a.m..

146
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.458
but all the delivery services
are backed up

147
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.584
because of the rain.

148
00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:37.420
You want me
to transport this...

149
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:38.505
to Brooklyn?

150
00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:39.673
Mm.

151
00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.007
Okay.

152
00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:46.429
* Well. I've been looking
for peace in my mind *

153
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.847
Safe travels.

154
00:05:52.394 --> 00:05:54.979
This doesn't make sense.

155
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.690
Am I in the wrong place?

156
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.608
Where is 5J?

157
00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.943

Are you ready? *

-Hey!

167
00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:21.589
[laughter]

168
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.842
And who are you.
Miss Looky-Loo?

169
00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:26.553
Oh. nobody.
I'm looking for suite 5J.

170
00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:29.264
It's an accounting firm.
Maybe you can help me.

171
00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:30.724
Well. all right. Nobody.

172
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:33.309
I think you can tell
this is not an accounting firm.

173
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.061
I need you

174
00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.813
to bop that little body
back down to the lobby

175
00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.440
and tell Curtis
to start doing his job

176
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.899
and stop letting
everybody up in here...

177
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.694
[exhaling] ...or you could
bop on into this class.

178
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.654
The schedule's
posted on the door.

179
00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:47.032
At least. that's the schedule
for the next three months.

180
00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:50.410
If business doesn't go up.
I'm likely shutting down.

181
00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.328
But until then.
you're welcome to come back...

182

with a credit card.

183
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:57.417
See you next time.
All right.

184
00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.252
Whoo! Here we go!

185
00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.087
Let me see that again.

186
00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.256
And a-five.
six. seven. eight.

187
00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:05.300
and one. two. three.

188
00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:09.679
four. five and a-six.
and seven. eight...

189
00:07:09.721 --> 00:07:11.931
* Let's get this started *

190
00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.516
* Right now *

191
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.729
Two minutes.

192
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:19.814
Wallford application...

193
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.610
Oh. here it is.

194
00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:25.779
Get everything delivered?

195
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.739
Um...

196
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.574
Oh. personal business
on company time?

197
00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.702
I have two minutes
to submit Paul's application.

198
00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:34.704
So I see.

199
00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:35.372
Wallford?

200
00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:36.790
Oh. posh!

201
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:39.292

[error beeping]

206
00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.763
No. No.

[sighing]

208
00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.771
Yeah. well.
not only was it not good.

209
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.815
it was questionably legal.

210
00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.525
[laughter]

211
00:08:03.566 --> 00:08:04.693
But Mark caught it!

212
00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.195
And he called
the other side out on it.

213
00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:09.239
The judge agreed.

214
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.157
He single-handedly
saved the case.

215
00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.492
Well. not single-handedly.

216
00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:14.411
Don't be modest. Smith.

217
00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:15.912
You're doing good work.

218
00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.455
We all see that.

219
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:18.915
Thank you.

220
00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.959
And thank you both
for coming.

221
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:23.795
I want to say
a special thanks to Danielle.

222
00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:26.840
who did single-handedly
prepare this meal.

223
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:29.050
Danielle.
this meal is perfection.

224
00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.510
Oh...

225
00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.012
I hate that I'll be repaying
your hospitality

226
00:08:32.053 --> 00:08:34.931
by keeping Mark at the office
even more.

227
00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.642
We support Mark's work
100 percent.

228
00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.478
Everything he and the firm
have done for the community...

229
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.022
really valuable.

230
00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:43.398
[Jameson] Indeed.

231
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.569
A man of Mark's values...
very valuable to the firm.

Have you eaten
your breakfast yet?

241
00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.099
What are you doing. missy?

242
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.852
It's just a stupid
TikTok dance challenge.

243
00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.437
If your instructor saw you...

244
00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:24.522
I don't know what
my instructors want.

245
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.858
I pick up the choreography
flawlessly.

246
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.235
I dance with clean lines.

247
00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.321
complete extensions.

248
00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:34.074
but I dance without the soul.
Boris keeps saying.

249
00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:37.494
They want me to be
exactly like every other dancer.

250
00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:38.703
perfectly in sync.

251
00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.663
yet they want me to be unique!

252
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:42.582
Believe me. baby...

253
00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:44.417
the Metropolitan
School of Ballet

254
00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:46.002
wants precision.

255
00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.545
not unique.

256
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:49.464
Unique is overrated.

257
00:09:49.506 --> 00:09:50.507
Mom...

258
00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:52.133
I have been there.
done that.

259
00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.636
and I have a drawer full of
unpublished music to prove it.

260
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.304
but you...

261
00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:58.598
my perfect little ballerina.

262
00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.891
you stay focused

263
00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.851
and keep your eye
on the prize.

264
00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.316
[sighing] Morning.

265
00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.192
[Danielle] You want coffee?

266
00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:11.027
I'll take it to go.

267
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:12.987
I-I know it's Saturday.
but...

268
00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:13.863
I get it.

269
00:10:13.905 --> 00:10:15.281
Handle your business.

270
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:17.617
Let me make it up to you.

271
00:10:17.659 --> 00:10:19.119
How about I take you
on a special date night.

272
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.286
uh. Thursday?

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:21.621

274
00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:24.332
Sandra's got aquatic therapy

275
00:10:24.374 --> 00:10:26.251
Ah. that's right.

276
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.794
How about next Saturday?

277
00:10:27.836 --> 00:10:30.797
I'm helping RJ
with his fundraiser.

278
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.590
Your brother's dance studio's
not gonna make or break

279
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:34.300
over some $9 rib tips

280
00:10:34.342 --> 00:10:35.635
or peach cobbler

281
00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:36.886
at a cookout fundraiser.

282
00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:38.847
Don't knock
my peach cobbler!

283
00:10:38.888 --> 00:10:41.683
We could really use
a date night. Dani.

284
00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.644
I haven't had your peach cobbler
in quite a while.

285
00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:47.647
Well. it's hard for you
to enjoy my peach cobbler

286
00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:50.650
when you're always working
until almost midnight.

287
00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:53.695
Oh. touché. [laughing]

288
00:10:53.737 --> 00:10:55.238
Don't "touché" me
when you have to go to work.

289
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.823
Oh!

290
00:10:56.865 --> 00:10:58.533
[chuckling]
All right. Rain check?

291
00:10:58.575 --> 00:10:59.826
Hey. what about Friday?

292
00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.202
I mean. I know
you have choir rehearsal.

293
00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.996
but maybe after.

294
00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:05.749
No. No more choir rehearsal
for now.

295
00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:09.169
I lost my solo.

296
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:10.587
Oh...

297
00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:12.672
Because I haven't been able
to make enough practices.

298
00:11:12.714 --> 00:11:14.716
Bye. Mom.
Bye. Dad.

299
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.346
What's she up to?

300
00:11:19.387 --> 00:11:21.264
Something tells me no good.

Thanks again for
taking Quinn the other day.

307
00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:31.149
Oh. you're welcome.

308
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:33.068
Hey. what are you
up to right now?

309
00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.862
Uh. well.
Paul has a study group.

310
00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.781
and Phillip's
down the street at Tracy's.

311
00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:39.199
doing his science project.

312
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.244
Okay. so that's the boys.
but I was asking about you.

313
00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:45.372
Right.

314
00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:47.374
Occupational hazard.

315
00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:48.792
So. I have an idea.

316
00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.710
How about you get dressed...

317
00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:51.878
not that you don't look great.

318
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.463
but. uh. get dressed.

319
00:11:53.505 --> 00:11:55.131
and come out to breakfast
with me.

320
00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:56.966
I mean.
you gotta eat. right?

321
00:11:57.008 --> 00:11:57.926
My treat.

322
00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.594
You don't need
to treat me. Sam.

323
00:11:59.636 --> 00:12:01.471
I'm inviting you out.

324
00:12:01.513 --> 00:12:04.974
So...

325
00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.184
meet you back here at 10:00?

326
00:12:06.226 --> 00:12:07.644
Is that enough time?

327
00:12:07.686 --> 00:12:10.188
I'm really sorry.
I'd love to.

328
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.565
but I just remembered
I have to be somewhere at 10:00.

329
00:12:12.607 --> 00:12:15.568
Um. can I take a rain check?

330
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.904
Sure. No. yeah. Of course.

00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:35.273
* Whoa. oh. oh. oh... *

364
00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.108
RJ?

365
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.651
What is
this person doing?

366
00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.653
RJ? Make this stop!

367
00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:42.155
* Are you ready.
are you ready *

368
00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:43.823
Okay. you wanna
come at me?

369
00:13:43.865 --> 00:13:45.575
You're gonna have to come
a lot harder than that!

370
00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.952
Uh...

371
00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:49.496
I came for...

372
00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:51.331
I came for my daughter...
not for whatever this is.

373
00:13:51.373 --> 00:13:52.248
[RJ] Take five.

374
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.209
[snapping] Sandra!

375
00:13:55.377 --> 00:13:57.754
Yes. child.
I texted your mother.

376
00:13:57.796 --> 00:13:59.381
Sandra.

377
00:13:59.422 --> 00:14:02.967
You know the school vehemently
forbids outside dance classes...

378
00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:04.844
especially in this style.

379
00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:07.180
I'm just trying to find
some of the soul

380
00:14:07.222 --> 00:14:09.557
my new instructor
insists I don't have.

381
00:14:09.599 --> 00:14:10.809
Sandra. believe me.

382
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.228
this is not the soul
Boris was talking about.

383
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.437
No offense. RJ.

384
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.356
None taken.

385
00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:17.315
[he chuckles]

386
00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:18.858
Sorry.
so you're not a dancer?

387
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.402
Oh. don't let her fool you.

388
00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:23.029
Dani can dance.
but she's really a singer.

389
00:14:23.071 --> 00:14:24.864
But you. little miss.

390
00:14:24.906 --> 00:14:26.241
you were holding out on me.

391
00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.284
This isn't hobby-level dancing.

392
00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.245
You've been a professional?
Any Broadway?

393
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:34.541
Plenty of talented performers
never made it to Broadway.

394
00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:36.376
Right. Dani?

395
00:14:36.418 --> 00:14:40.046
But that doesn't
have to mean it's too late.

396
00:14:40.088 --> 00:14:42.257
What are you up to. RJ?

397
00:14:45.552 --> 00:14:46.636
"Take Two."

398
00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.221
A new competition show...

399
00:14:48.263 --> 00:14:50.181
a spinoff of
"America's Next Superstar."

400
00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:52.684
but all the acts are duos.

401
00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:53.935
No. No.

402
00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:56.229
One class does not mean
I'm a professional.

403
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.565
I watch those shows.
and I am not that.

404
00:14:58.606 --> 00:15:00.233
[RJ] You have that in you.

405
00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:01.609
and what's missing
I can get out of you.

406
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:04.237
So you'd be my partner?

407
00:15:04.279 --> 00:15:06.656
Not exactly.

408
00:15:06.698 --> 00:15:07.615
Dani!

409
00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:09.743
Oh. no.

410
00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.286
No!

411
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:12.662
No.

412
00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:16.082
Dani. this show isn't
just about the performers.

413
00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:18.626
They send a camera crew
to record rehearsals

414
00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:19.502
and really dig into the process.

415
00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:21.129
It would be

416
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:24.257
a chance for people to see me
do my magic as a choreographer.

417
00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:27.218
This kind of exposure
could be a game-changer.

418
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.721
You have all these young
professional dancers

419
00:15:29.763 --> 00:15:30.805
to choose from.

420
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.098
[RJ] Just like
every other number.

421
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.725
I want to present a duo
that will stand out.

422
00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.060
something unique.

423
00:15:35.101 --> 00:15:36.478
Unique is overrated!

424
00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.104
Imagine it. Danielle.

425
00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:40.398
Two old... I mean...

426
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.150
former performers

427
00:15:42.192 --> 00:15:45.070
getting a second take
on Take Two.

428
00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.113
The show will eat it up.

429
00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.324
Okay. so what's in it for me?

430
00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:52.118
Besides. of course.
the priceless embarrassment

431
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.870
of my children having
to watch their mother

432
00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:55.789
dance on live TV?

433
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.501
A $100.000 grand prize
split three ways?

434
00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.753
$33.000?

435
00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:02.796
I'm in!

436
00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:04.798
My mom... on TV?

437
00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:07.133
[chuckling] No. No.

438
00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.803
Uh... I'd be helping
your uncle to get on TV.

439
00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:10.929
That's different.

440
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.222
Then you'll help me?

441
00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.140
I didn't say that! No.

442
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.560
There's a lot going on. RJ.

443
00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:18.895
Mark's job...

444
00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.980
Sandra's showcase in May.

445
00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:22.982
You know I am always down
to help you out. but...

446
00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.402
Then help me.

447
00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:28.947
[sighing]

448
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.365
[***]

449
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:37.163
[RJ] So here's the deal...

450
00:16:37.205 --> 00:16:39.749
the acts who make it
to the finals

451
00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:42.252
will have docu-style film crews
sent to their hometowns.

452
00:16:42.293 --> 00:16:45.588
so getting to that point
is our main focus.

453
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.842
My sons are gonna be
so excited to be on TV.

454
00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:50.552
What about your husband
and Sandra?

455
00:16:51.886 --> 00:16:53.513
I'm not too worried
about Mark.

456
00:16:53.555 --> 00:16:56.641
Is your partner okay
with being filmed?

457
00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:57.934
Um...

458
00:16:57.976 --> 00:16:59.394
he's on Broadway...

459
00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:01.187
in Los Angeles.

460
00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:03.606
He was supposed
to come back for us.

461
00:17:03.648 --> 00:17:06.109
but I think he got stuck
in that infamous L.A. traffic...

462
00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:07.068
10 years ago.

463
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:08.153
[chuckling]

464
00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:12.240
Props to you for doing that
on your own. Claire.

465
00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:15.577
I can't imagine
raising Sandra on my own.

466
00:17:17.078 --> 00:17:20.123
You ladies need
to find your power.

467
00:17:20.165 --> 00:17:21.791
What do you want to say
with your performance?

468
00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:23.335
"Give me a lot of cash

469
00:17:23.376 --> 00:17:25.045
so I can pay for my son's

470
00:17:25.086 --> 00:17:27.589
insanely expensive
private-school tuition."

471
00:17:29.758 --> 00:17:31.593
If I'm honest...

472
00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:35.764
...I always wanted
the chance to play Effie

473
00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:36.890
in Dreamgirls.

474
00:17:36.931 --> 00:17:37.891
[chuckles bashfully]

475
00:17:37.932 --> 00:17:41.019
Sing... and act.

476
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.228
[inhaling]

477
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.522
We both dreamed
of being on Broadway.

478
00:17:44.564 --> 00:17:47.609
Your dream role
is Dreamgirls.

479
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.612
We're the Dream Moms.

480
00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:54.240
I don't hate it.

481
00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:56.576
All right.

482
00:17:56.618 --> 00:17:58.036
All right. Dream Moms.

483
00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:59.829
You've got a name.

484
00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:02.248
Now... you need a routine.

485
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.918
I want you both to come
to our next rehearsal

486
00:18:04.959 --> 00:18:07.337
ready to exemplify
this dream.

487
00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:11.049
Um. do you want to go
for a coffee.

488
00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:12.676
and we can
work this out?

489
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.386
I have to get home.

490
00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:18.515
I have so many pointe-shoe
ribbons to sew.

491
00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:21.851
[RJ] Um...

492
00:18:24.104 --> 00:18:26.773
Well. we can always
talk about it at my house.

493
00:18:26.815 --> 00:18:28.733
Great.

494
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:38.284
This is your house?

495
00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.494
Yes.

496
00:18:39.536 --> 00:18:41.538
[chuckling]
Why do you say it like that?

497
00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.164
No. it's just...

498
00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:44.791
I can't believe
anybody lives here.

499
00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.126
It's like a museum.

500
00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:49.546
All the art.
and it's so...

501
00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:51.798
"So" what?

502
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.341
Honestly?

503
00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:54.968
Clean.

504
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.177
[chuckling]

505
00:18:56.219 --> 00:18:58.430
How do you manage it all?

506
00:19:00.015 --> 00:19:02.475
Between my volunteer work.

507
00:19:02.517 --> 00:19:05.437
networking events
with my husband.

508
00:19:05.478 --> 00:19:07.731
and keeping Sandra's schedule.

509
00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:09.858
it's a lot!

510
00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:12.110
I don't know
how I'd get it done

511
00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:13.236
if I didn't have any help.

512
00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:15.864
I'm a single mom.
I am the help.

513
00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.158
What are you saying. Claire?

514
00:19:18.199 --> 00:19:20.368
Oh! No. No. no. no. no. no.
I didn't mean...

515
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.455
My husband and I both
came from humble beginnings.

516
00:19:23.496 --> 00:19:26.416
We worked really hard
to get here.

517
00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:28.209
I know.

518
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.547
[gently] But remember
what RJ said about us?

519
00:19:32.589 --> 00:19:35.467
Where are you
in your life?

520
00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:40.013
I think
we might need something

521
00:19:40.055 --> 00:19:41.723
a little stronger
than camomile

522
00:19:41.765 --> 00:19:43.558
to have this conversation.

523
00:19:50.732 --> 00:19:54.319
When I wanted to be a star.
life was just too messy.

524
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:56.696
There were auditions

525
00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:57.906
and babysitting.

526
00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:58.907
[pouring drinks]

527
00:19:58.948 --> 00:19:59.991
Mark was...

528
00:20:00.033 --> 00:20:01.326
[glass slides on counter]

529
00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:05.288
...starting to regain momentum
as a staff lawyer.

530
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.749
and the note was always...

531
00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:10.877
..."unique voice."

532
00:20:12.253 --> 00:20:14.756
"Unique" couldn't pay the bills.

533
00:20:16.257 --> 00:20:18.385
So you hitched your star
to theirs?

534
00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.179
I like to think of it more

535
00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:22.931
as a "wind beneath my wings"
situation.

536
00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.683
thank you very much.

537
00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.810
You helped your husband
advance his career.

538
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.311
I get it. believe me.

539
00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:32.273
And then there was
Sandra. and now RJ.

540
00:20:33.441 --> 00:20:35.819
Everyone needs
a cheerleader in their corner.

541
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.986
[Claire] I know that smile.

542
00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:40.448
Every mom knows that smile.

543
00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:42.742
Wouldn't it be

544
00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:44.160
so great

545
00:20:44.202 --> 00:20:46.621
if this show could get us
off of the sidelines

546
00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:48.665
and back onto
center stage?

547
00:20:48.707 --> 00:20:50.458
All I know

548
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.919
is that I want to help
my little brother

549
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:55.964
get some exposure.

550
00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:57.757
What about you?

551
00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.593
I need the cash.

552
00:21:00.635 --> 00:21:02.887
And exposure's
not gonna cut it.

553
00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.681
We need to win for that.

554
00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:13.857
[***]

555
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.739
Was that you. Mom?

556
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.950
Me a million years ago. yeah.

557
00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:26.745
You look so... young.

558
00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:29.581
I'm gonna choose
to not be offended by that.

559
00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:32.375
Look at this one. Mom.

560
00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:34.544
What were you.
some kind of street performer?

561
00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:37.047
No. [laughing]

562
00:21:37.088 --> 00:21:38.923
We would. um...

563
00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.926
we would hang out at this cafe
in between rehearsals.

564
00:21:41.968 --> 00:21:44.721
and without a doubt.
someone would get up

565
00:21:44.763 --> 00:21:46.639
and start dancing
out of nowhere...

566
00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:48.183
in the streets. yes.

567
00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:50.560
but we weren't
street performers.

568
00:21:50.602 --> 00:21:52.437
We were...
-Crazy. looks like.

569
00:21:52.479 --> 00:21:53.646
[both chuckling]

570
00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:55.482
No. we were inspired.

571
00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:56.983
What happened to you?

572
00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:58.693
I'm gonna tell you

573
00:21:58.735 --> 00:22:00.612
what happened to me today.
smarty-pants.

574
00:22:02.072 --> 00:22:04.157
I spoke
to the admissions counselor

575
00:22:04.199 --> 00:22:04.824
at the Wallford School.

576
00:22:04.866 --> 00:22:06.242
Mom...

577
00:22:06.284 --> 00:22:08.161
I'm the reason that you didn't
get that scholarship.

578
00:22:08.203 --> 00:22:09.496
and I want to make sure

579
00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:10.622
that you're gonna go
to that school.

580
00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:12.665
What's that mean?

581
00:22:12.707 --> 00:22:15.168
I spoke to her.
mom to mom.

582
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.836
and she told me

583
00:22:16.878 --> 00:22:19.673
that if you do
a supplemental essay.

584
00:22:19.714 --> 00:22:21.466
she will consider
giving it to the committee

585
00:22:21.508 --> 00:22:23.510
as a late submission.

586
00:22:23.551 --> 00:22:25.512
"What makes
a Wallford man?"

587
00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:27.222
I don't know. What?

588
00:22:27.263 --> 00:22:30.183
No. that's the essay topic.

589
00:22:30.225 --> 00:22:31.685
If it's this complicated.

590
00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:33.728
maybe this just
isn't meant to be.

591
00:22:34.896 --> 00:22:38.400
I didn't make it to Broadway...

592
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:40.735
but a school like Wallford...

593
00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:44.197
...it can help you
get your dream.

594
00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:46.616
[***]

595
00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:54.040

Sandra. what...?

599
00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:09.389
I know. Mom.
I know. It just...

600
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:10.390
No. no. no. no. no.

601
00:23:10.432 --> 00:23:12.392
What is this song?

602
00:23:12.434 --> 00:23:13.977
I love it!

603
00:23:14.019 --> 00:23:16.521
Oh. it's "Bring It Back."
Why?

604
00:23:16.563 --> 00:23:18.523
Hey...

605
00:23:18.565 --> 00:23:19.566
[Sandra chuckling]

606
00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.359
[humming tune]

607
00:23:21.401 --> 00:23:23.319
Come on. Mom.
It's super fine.

608
00:23:23.361 --> 00:23:25.488
Oh! It is super fine!

609
00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.948
[Sandra laughing]

610
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.949
Hey! Hey...

611
00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:29.200
[laughing] Mom...

612
00:23:29.242 --> 00:23:31.244
Hey-ey-ey-ey!
Show me what you were doing.

613
00:23:31.286 --> 00:23:32.245
Okay. okay. So it's...

614
00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:33.288
Ready?
-'Kay.

615
00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:34.581
Okay. Gotta find that beat.

616
00:23:34.622 --> 00:23:36.249
One. two. three. and four.

617
00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:37.459
Uh-huh. I can do that.

618
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.543
-Okay. ready?
-Yeah.

619
00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:41.046
One. two. three. and four.

00:23:41.087 --> 00:23:42.881
-Hey!
-Hey!

Hey.

Oh. eh. eh.

[laughing]

625
00:23:47.635 --> 00:23:50.096
I love this beat. Boop!

Boop. Boop.

My shoe fell off!

* No. no *

630
00:23:59.189 --> 00:24:01.191
* So bring it back *

631
00:24:01.232 --> 00:24:03.568
* Never want to be
the one you've forgotten *

632
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.070
* Because here I come *

633
00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:08.114
* Only want to be

00:24:24.547 --> 00:24:26.216
What?

640
00:24:26.257 --> 00:24:27.300
No. it was good.

641
00:24:27.342 --> 00:24:28.510
It was...

642
00:24:28.551 --> 00:24:30.053
It was really... good.

643
00:24:30.095 --> 00:24:31.304
Yeah.

644
00:24:31.346 --> 00:24:33.723
Mm-hmm.
but good ain't great.

645
00:24:33.765 --> 00:24:35.725
and you two
are gonna have to be great

646
00:24:35.767 --> 00:24:37.435
if you want to make any kind

647
00:24:37.477 --> 00:24:39.104
of serious impression
with the judges.

648
00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:40.105
Was it sharp?

649
00:24:40.146 --> 00:24:42.482
Is it flat? I...

650
00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:43.900
I don't understand.

651
00:24:43.942 --> 00:24:45.819
Technically. perfection.

652
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.570
but inspirationally.

653
00:24:47.612 --> 00:24:49.823
it was...

654
00:24:49.864 --> 00:24:51.908
It was a little flat.

655
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.869
Okay. Claire.

656
00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:58.832
Well. let's see where
you're at with the choreography.

657
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:01.710
Okay.

658
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:04.254
[sighing]

659
00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:06.339
[beat starts]

[exhaling]

* I got this feeling *

00:25:10.593 --> 00:25:13.221
* It's so impossible to ignore *

663
00:25:16.516 --> 00:25:18.685
* Or am I dreamin'? *

664
00:25:18.727 --> 00:25:20.937
* This déjà vu gonna leave me *

* Wanting more
and more and more *

00:25:26.067 --> 00:25:28.069
* Imma gonna get
a little personal *

00:25:28.111 --> 00:25:29.988
* You're never gonna get
another chance. you know *

668
00:25:31.364 --> 00:25:33.533
* Of taking it home *

669
00:25:33.575 --> 00:25:35.660
* Yeah. can you feel it *

670
00:25:35.702 --> 00:25:37.120
* It's getting clo... *

671

[music stops]

672
00:25:39.456 --> 00:25:40.540
It was that bad. huh?

673
00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:43.001
Not that bad. per se.

674
00:25:43.043 --> 00:25:44.878
You need to build up
your stamina.

675
00:25:44.919 --> 00:25:46.880
Sing from your diaphragm.

676
00:25:46.921 --> 00:25:48.798
Clean up your isolations.

677
00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.136
Your kicks are high.
but they need some extending.

678
00:25:53.178 --> 00:25:55.722
Your flicks are sharp.
but they have no narrative.

679
00:25:55.764 --> 00:25:58.350
Your runs need more support.
and more...

680
00:25:58.391 --> 00:26:00.894
I don't know. flavor?

681
00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:03.897
Just a few things to clean up
before the auditions.

682
00:26:03.938 --> 00:26:06.858
"Just a few things"?
We only have a few weeks.

683
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.068
Just bottom-line it. RJ.

684
00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:10.153
What really is
the problem?

685
00:26:10.195 --> 00:26:11.780
[sighing] Passion.

686
00:26:12.947 --> 00:26:14.699
Check the lost and found.
because without it.

687
00:26:14.741 --> 00:26:16.785
this ship has sunk
before it even set sail.

688
00:26:18.787 --> 00:26:20.205
Okay. let's... let's...
let's do it again.

689
00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:22.332
Let's try it again.

690
00:26:22.374 --> 00:26:24.459
[Claire] Thrift shopping
is my inspiration.

691
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:26.419
[door bell ringing]

692
00:26:26.461 --> 00:26:29.214
Well. we're both certainly
passionate about our kids.

693
00:26:29.255 --> 00:26:30.799
Definitely.

694
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.260
You know. I read this
magazine article once

695
00:26:34.302 --> 00:26:36.513
about finding your passion
after divorce.

696
00:26:36.554 --> 00:26:37.972
Don't ask.

697
00:26:38.014 --> 00:26:41.434
But it was all about
connecting to your senses.

698
00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:43.061
Okay. Sounds promising.

699
00:26:43.103 --> 00:26:46.272
There was a buffet
and a blindfold involved.

700
00:26:46.314 --> 00:26:47.565
It's a start.

701
00:26:47.607 --> 00:26:49.317
[chuckling]

702
00:26:50.985 --> 00:26:53.154
That looks like I'm gonna
get elected to the PTA.

703
00:26:53.196 --> 00:26:54.698
This is cashmere!

704
00:26:54.739 --> 00:26:56.574
It's expensive.

705
00:26:56.616 --> 00:26:58.118
Okay. fine.

706
00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:00.662
Okay. so when you're not
dressing for the PTA.

707
00:27:00.704 --> 00:27:02.789
who are you dressing for?

708
00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:05.166
Uh. warmer weather?
I don't get...

709
00:27:05.208 --> 00:27:07.585
Is there someone special
in your life?

710
00:27:07.627 --> 00:27:09.170
[chuckling]

711
00:27:09.212 --> 00:27:11.089
No! No.

712
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:13.174
I have two special boys
in my life.

713
00:27:13.216 --> 00:27:15.719
and their names are Paul Jr.
and Phillip.

714
00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.721
They are constantly
vying for my attention.

715
00:27:17.762 --> 00:27:19.180
so. no. there's no man.

716
00:27:19.222 --> 00:27:21.474
if that's what
you're getting at.

717
00:27:21.516 --> 00:27:23.268
Well. I mean. there is.

718
00:27:23.309 --> 00:27:24.310
[hangers clatter]

719
00:27:24.352 --> 00:27:26.146
Okay. A little tea.

720
00:27:26.187 --> 00:27:27.105
Spill.

721
00:27:28.565 --> 00:27:31.526
Sam... is not a man.

722
00:27:31.568 --> 00:27:33.403
He's my neighbor.

723
00:27:33.445 --> 00:27:34.362
[hangers rattle]

724
00:27:34.404 --> 00:27:36.239
If you say so.

725
00:27:36.281 --> 00:27:38.742
[they chuckle]

726
00:27:38.783 --> 00:27:40.577
Look. we really got
to start thinking about

727
00:27:40.618 --> 00:27:42.829
wardrobe for our act.

728
00:27:42.871 --> 00:27:44.330
You know. my boss says

729
00:27:44.372 --> 00:27:46.875
"the first step to feeling good
is looking good."

730
00:27:46.916 --> 00:27:48.501
[gasping] Wait.

731
00:27:48.543 --> 00:27:50.628
Look at this!

732
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.340
That... is a look.

733
00:27:53.381 --> 00:27:54.966
I thought you'd like it!

734
00:27:55.008 --> 00:27:57.719
It's so elegant.

735
00:27:57.761 --> 00:28:00.013
It looks like something
you'd wear

736
00:28:00.055 --> 00:28:01.598
waiting on a gentleman caller

737
00:28:01.639 --> 00:28:04.809
called "Beauregard"
or "Langston."

738
00:28:04.851 --> 00:28:06.686
[chuckling]

739
00:28:06.728 --> 00:28:08.605
I'm gonna get it.

740
00:28:08.646 --> 00:28:10.440
Okay. Blanche. Get it!

741
00:28:10.482 --> 00:28:11.858
What about you?

742
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.360
[deep breath]

743
00:28:13.401 --> 00:28:15.195
I just don't see anything

744
00:28:15.236 --> 00:28:18.281
that sparks in me
as much joy as that robe...

745
00:28:18.323 --> 00:28:19.991
Dressing gown.

746
00:28:20.033 --> 00:28:23.495
...as that robe
is sparking in you.

747
00:28:23.536 --> 00:28:24.496
Okay.

748
00:28:24.537 --> 00:28:26.122
Fine.

749
00:28:26.164 --> 00:28:28.375
Then you're gonna have to find
your spark somewhere else.

750
00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:30.001
Well. okay. PTA!

751
00:28:30.043 --> 00:28:31.628
Challenge accepted.

752
00:28:41.554 --> 00:28:43.807
[sighing]

753
00:28:43.848 --> 00:28:45.558
Mark...

754
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.018
honey?

755
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.521
Would you come down here
for a moment?

756
00:28:49.562 --> 00:28:51.815
Uh. what is it. babe?

757
00:28:51.856 --> 00:28:53.900
I gotta finish this brief
by morning.

758
00:28:53.942 --> 00:28:55.652
Uh...

759
00:28:55.694 --> 00:28:57.779
oh. the brief can wait!

760
00:28:57.821 --> 00:28:58.863
Okay.

761
00:28:58.905 --> 00:29:00.573
Put this on me.

762
00:29:00.615 --> 00:29:02.242
Yes. ma'am.

763
00:29:02.283 --> 00:29:05.036
Okay!

764
00:29:05.078 --> 00:29:06.830
Whatever this is.
I like it.

765
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:08.039
[chuckling]

766
00:29:08.081 --> 00:29:09.958
But. um. what are we doing?

767
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.293
Well. let's just. uh...

768
00:29:12.335 --> 00:29:13.420
call it

769
00:29:13.461 --> 00:29:14.671
date night.

770
00:29:14.713 --> 00:29:15.755
Okay.

771
00:29:15.797 --> 00:29:17.340
Claire read an article
about...

772
00:29:17.382 --> 00:29:19.050
connecting

773
00:29:19.092 --> 00:29:21.219
to your passion
through the senses.

774
00:29:21.261 --> 00:29:24.597
Oh. Okay. well. remind me
to thank this Claire.

775
00:29:25.765 --> 00:29:27.142
Blindfolded.

776
00:29:27.183 --> 00:29:31.646
you allow yourself to experience
all the other senses

777
00:29:31.688 --> 00:29:34.816
in a more... heightened way.

778
00:29:34.858 --> 00:29:36.151
Let's try it.

779
00:29:36.192 --> 00:29:37.777
Let's go.
All right. here we go.

780
00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:38.737
Here we go.

781
00:29:38.778 --> 00:29:40.280
Mm-hmm.

782
00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:41.865
Ooh...

783
00:29:41.906 --> 00:29:43.074
an orange.

784
00:29:43.116 --> 00:29:45.493
Ooh. you're good!
You're good.

785
00:29:45.535 --> 00:29:47.912
All right. all right.
let's try something else.

786
00:29:47.954 --> 00:29:49.289
Ahh...

787
00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.499
...mm!

788
00:29:51.541 --> 00:29:53.626
I know this one.

789
00:29:53.668 --> 00:29:55.795
It's strawberry.

790
00:29:55.837 --> 00:29:57.630
Mm. The best of the berries.

791
00:29:59.132 --> 00:30:00.884
There's something stuck.

792
00:30:00.925 --> 00:30:02.927
I think I got
a strawberry seed stuck.

793
00:30:02.969 --> 00:30:04.262
Right here.

794
00:30:04.304 --> 00:30:06.181
L-let's try something else.
Uh...

795
00:30:06.222 --> 00:30:07.849
open your hands.

796
00:30:07.891 --> 00:30:10.602
Okay.

797
00:30:10.643 --> 00:30:12.771
Ow! What was that?

798
00:30:12.812 --> 00:30:14.522
A molten stone?

799
00:30:14.564 --> 00:30:18.109
You...
you could've fed that to me!

800
00:30:18.151 --> 00:30:19.569
I mean. you said
you wanted

801
00:30:19.611 --> 00:30:22.113
to experience all your senses
in a more heightened way.

802
00:30:22.155 --> 00:30:24.949
Heightened!
Not a third-degree burn.

803
00:30:24.991 --> 00:30:26.451
[Mark laughing]

804
00:30:26.493 --> 00:30:28.453
I mean. what is all this. Dani?

805
00:30:28.495 --> 00:30:32.165
I mean. the strawberries I get.
but a hot potato?

806
00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:33.500
Okay. okay. okay.
you got me.

807
00:30:33.541 --> 00:30:35.001
[sighing]

808
00:30:35.043 --> 00:30:37.921
This is not
exactly a date night.

809
00:30:37.962 --> 00:30:40.256
You know that thing
I'm doing for RJ?

810
00:30:40.298 --> 00:30:42.342
Oh. this is about RJ?

811
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.387
He says I need
to regain my passion.

812
00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:50.308
I mean... you've got passion.

813
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.018
I mean. passion for your family

814
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.186
and for...

815
00:30:53.228 --> 00:30:54.396
your choir

816
00:30:54.437 --> 00:30:56.481
and your philanthropic work.

817
00:30:56.523 --> 00:30:58.817
but maybe the passion
RJ's talking about

818
00:30:58.858 --> 00:31:02.570
is something you may have
lost for yourself. and...

819
00:31:04.364 --> 00:31:06.991
Oh. my goodness.
I'm agreeing with RJ.

820
00:31:07.033 --> 00:31:09.244
Forget RJ.

821
00:31:09.285 --> 00:31:10.662
No. you're agreeing with RJ.

822
00:31:10.704 --> 00:31:12.330
No. no. no! I mean. we...

823
00:31:12.372 --> 00:31:14.165
Don't you have
a brief to work on?

824
00:31:14.207 --> 00:31:15.625
The brief can wait. all right?

825
00:31:15.667 --> 00:31:17.210
-No!
-[laughing]

826
00:31:19.838 --> 00:31:21.464
[smoke detector beeping]

827
00:31:21.506 --> 00:31:24.968
[Paul] Fire! Mom? Fire!

828
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.219
Dinner's on fire!

829
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:28.346
Oh. my god.

830
00:31:33.184 --> 00:31:34.060
[lid clanging]

831
00:31:34.102 --> 00:31:35.437
Peanut butter and jelly?

832
00:31:37.063 --> 00:31:39.816
Mom. I...
I think you're molting.

833
00:31:39.858 --> 00:31:41.151
Okay.

834
00:31:41.192 --> 00:31:42.861
[knocking]

835
00:31:42.902 --> 00:31:43.903
I'll get it.

836
00:31:43.945 --> 00:31:45.280
[lid clattering]

837
00:31:45.321 --> 00:31:47.365
Hey. I heard the smoke alarm.
What's happening?

838
00:31:47.407 --> 00:31:49.200
Um. Sam... we're fine.

839
00:31:49.242 --> 00:31:50.285
Do you need help?

840
00:31:50.326 --> 00:31:51.494
No. Stay right there.

841
00:31:51.536 --> 00:31:53.872
I do not need any help.
It's okay.

842
00:31:53.913 --> 00:31:55.331
[puff]

843
00:31:55.373 --> 00:31:58.209
Uh. uh. are you wearing a...
is that a ball gown?

844
00:31:58.251 --> 00:32:00.628
It's a dressing gown.
It's vintage.

845
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:03.048
Hey. you're bleeding.
Are you...?

846
00:32:03.089 --> 00:32:04.507
Um. it's grape jelly.

847
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:06.259
I. um...

848
00:32:06.301 --> 00:32:08.303
I'm doing an experiment.

849
00:32:08.345 --> 00:32:10.305
Clearly.
[chuckling]

850
00:32:10.347 --> 00:32:12.724
You know. um. we really
don't need your help.

851
00:32:12.766 --> 00:32:14.726
but I appreciate it.

852
00:32:14.768 --> 00:32:15.935
[Sam] Oh.

853
00:32:15.977 --> 00:32:17.687
Yeah. okay.

854
00:32:17.729 --> 00:32:19.397
We are okay.

855
00:32:19.439 --> 00:32:20.857
Are you sure
you guys don't need anything?

856
00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:23.318
Other than maybe
a psychological evaluation. no.

857
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.320
We really do
appreciate your help. Sam.

858
00:32:26.821 --> 00:32:29.366
[***]

859
00:32:29.407 --> 00:32:30.784
Good night. Sam.

860
00:32:30.825 --> 00:32:32.619
Good night... Claire.

861
00:32:34.954 --> 00:32:36.414
[Phillip] Night. Sam!

862
00:32:36.456 --> 00:32:38.500
Bye!

863
00:32:39.793 --> 00:32:41.252
[exhaling]

864
00:32:41.294 --> 00:32:42.671
[Quinn groaning]

865
00:32:42.712 --> 00:32:44.673
What is that?

866
00:32:44.714 --> 00:32:49.052
Either Quinn ate a pigeon.
or he's coughing up your dress.

867
00:32:49.094 --> 00:32:51.763
It's a vintage
dressing gown.

868
00:32:51.805 --> 00:32:54.140
[huffing]

869
00:32:54.182 --> 00:32:56.726
* Every day you gotta
give it some more *

870
00:32:56.768 --> 00:32:58.144
* We've been working out
down on the floor *

871
00:32:58.186 --> 00:32:59.062
* Every day
you gotta give it your all *

872
00:32:59.104 --> 00:33:00.105
So sorry.

873
00:33:00.146 --> 00:33:02.691
Phillip had a baseball game.

874
00:33:02.732 --> 00:33:04.275
I'm doing my best.

875
00:33:04.317 --> 00:33:05.652
What is this supposed to be?

876
00:33:05.694 --> 00:33:06.986
Mm.

877
00:33:07.028 --> 00:33:08.571
Claire was
right about you. Dani.

878
00:33:08.613 --> 00:33:10.490
You do need to loosen up.

879
00:33:10.532 --> 00:33:13.660
Hold on. I don't know
that I said that.

880
00:33:13.702 --> 00:33:15.453
in so many words.

881
00:33:15.495 --> 00:33:16.955
You want me to sing here?

882
00:33:16.996 --> 00:33:18.123
[beat thumping]

883
00:33:18.164 --> 00:33:19.332
Now?

884
00:33:19.374 --> 00:33:20.917
It's okay.

885
00:33:20.959 --> 00:33:23.086
Don't worry about it. Danielle.
Nobody's really watching.

886
00:33:23.128 --> 00:33:24.963
Your job
is to make them look.

887
00:33:25.005 --> 00:33:26.256
This is silly!

888
00:33:26.297 --> 00:33:28.800
I-I don't need to do this!

889
00:33:28.842 --> 00:33:29.676
Well. you might be right.

890
00:33:29.718 --> 00:33:31.761
If joggers

891
00:33:31.803 --> 00:33:34.055
and bubble-blowing toddlers
can distract you.

892
00:33:34.097 --> 00:33:35.181
imagine how
you're gonna react

893
00:33:35.223 --> 00:33:36.558
when you've got three cameras

894
00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:38.476
in and out of your face
at the round-one audition.

895
00:33:38.518 --> 00:33:41.438
This isn't my first time
on a big stage. RJ.

896
00:33:41.479 --> 00:33:44.065
But it will be
your first time on camera.

897
00:33:44.107 --> 00:33:46.109
Okay?

898
00:33:46.151 --> 00:33:47.694
All right. let's do it.

899
00:33:47.736 --> 00:33:49.821
And five. six. seven. eight...

900
00:33:49.863 --> 00:33:51.948
* So bring it back *

901
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.075
* Never want to be
the one you've forgotten *

902
00:33:54.117 --> 00:33:56.119
* 'Cause here I come *

903
00:33:56.161 --> 00:33:58.413
* I only wanna be
the one you adore *

904
00:33:58.455 --> 00:34:00.498
* I want you back *

905
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.667
* You and me
Chemistry *

906
00:34:02.709 --> 00:34:07.172
* Setting fire
to the dance floor *

907
00:34:07.213 --> 00:34:08.923
* Yeah. yeah *

908
00:34:08.965 --> 00:34:11.051
[song ends]

909
00:34:11.092 --> 00:34:13.053
[RJ] Hmm. Again.

910
00:34:14.054 --> 00:34:15.597
[both sighing]

911
00:34:21.227 --> 00:34:22.187
[RJ] Everybody. listen up!

912
00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:24.356
If you can stay an extra 10.

913
00:34:24.397 --> 00:34:26.358
it would
help these mamas out.

914
00:34:26.399 --> 00:34:28.401
If not. get gone.

915
00:34:28.443 --> 00:34:30.570
Quickly. quickly.

916
00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:36.534
We need eyes...
critical. brutally honest.

917
00:34:36.576 --> 00:34:39.746
Tell it like it
T-I-"is" eyes.

918
00:34:39.788 --> 00:34:41.373
The Take Two
round-one audition

919
00:34:41.414 --> 00:34:43.625
is this weekend.

920
00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:46.127
and these little mamas have
been playin' at this routine

921
00:34:46.169 --> 00:34:48.171
when they need to be
slayin'.

922
00:34:48.213 --> 00:34:50.674
Come on. you two.

923
00:34:53.093 --> 00:34:55.011
Cue music!

924
00:34:55.053 --> 00:34:57.681
* I got this feeling *

925
00:34:57.722 --> 00:35:01.017
* It's so impossible
to ignore *

926
00:35:03.728 --> 00:35:05.438
* Or am I dreaming? *

927
00:35:06.648 --> 00:35:09.067
* This déjà vu
gonna leave me wanting *

928
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:10.402
* More and more *

929
00:35:10.443 --> 00:35:12.696
* And more *

930
00:35:12.737 --> 00:35:15.240
* Imma gonna get
a little personal *

931
00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:17.575
* You're never gonna
get another chance. you know *

932
00:35:18.493 --> 00:35:21.246
* Of taking it home *

933
00:35:21.287 --> 00:35:22.997
* Yeah. can you feel it? *

934
00:35:23.039 --> 00:35:26.459
* It's getting closer
and closer and closer *

935
00:35:27.293 --> 00:35:28.920
* Than before *

936
00:35:28.962 --> 00:35:31.423
* So bring it back *

937
00:35:31.464 --> 00:35:33.591
* If you want to be
a part of my future *

938
00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:35.510
* 'Cause here I come *

939
00:35:35.552 --> 00:35:38.096
* Or you're gonna be
a part of my past *

940
00:35:38.138 --> 00:35:39.014
* I want you back... *

941
00:35:39.055 --> 00:35:41.307
Oh!

942
00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:43.435
* Ooh. ooh *

943
00:35:43.476 --> 00:35:45.020
-[music stops]
-I'm okay.

944
00:35:45.061 --> 00:35:45.979
I'm fine. I'm fine.

945
00:35:47.355 --> 00:35:48.523
Ouch.

946
00:35:48.565 --> 00:35:49.524
That doesn't sound okay.

947
00:35:49.566 --> 00:35:52.027
[RJ] She's okay.

948
00:35:52.068 --> 00:35:53.862
Pigheaded. but okay.

949
00:35:53.903 --> 00:35:55.613
I was trying
to get them to watch.

950
00:35:55.655 --> 00:35:57.282
You're trying too hard.

951
00:35:57.323 --> 00:35:59.617
Yeah. yeah. I know. Danielle.
"Unique is overrated." right?

952
00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:01.619
Your ankle
sure seems to think so.

953
00:36:01.661 --> 00:36:03.371
[RJ] All right.
all right. you two.

954
00:36:03.413 --> 00:36:05.957
Keep to the routine.
Claire. please.

955
00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:08.626
Let's just get through
to the next round.

956
00:36:21.097 --> 00:36:22.182
[door opening]

957
00:36:22.223 --> 00:36:23.975
Take a little bit of a wave.

958
00:36:24.017 --> 00:36:25.143
[puffing] Gone.

959
00:36:25.185 --> 00:36:26.686
-[Paul chuckling]
-Hey!

960
00:36:26.728 --> 00:36:28.563
[Claire] Hey.

961
00:36:28.605 --> 00:36:30.231
[Sam] Try it.

962
00:36:32.692 --> 00:36:34.402
Oh. hey. You okay?

963
00:36:34.444 --> 00:36:36.196
It's fine.
It's just a little strain.

964
00:36:36.237 --> 00:36:37.280
[Sam] Are you sure?

965
00:36:37.322 --> 00:36:38.948
That looks like
more than a strain.

966
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:42.035
You should... yeah. take a seat.
I'll go get you some ice.

967
00:36:42.077 --> 00:36:43.286
There you go.

968
00:36:43.328 --> 00:36:44.954
[Phillip] Did it erupt?

969
00:36:44.996 --> 00:36:48.208
Uh. it kind of leaked
a little bit.

970
00:36:48.249 --> 00:36:50.377
It's pretty cool.
You can try again tomorrow.

971
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.880
Okay. I'll be up in a few.

972
00:36:54.714 --> 00:36:56.883
[she sighs]

973
00:36:56.925 --> 00:36:59.761
I haven't danced
like that since...

974
00:36:59.803 --> 00:37:02.764
well. since I became a mom.

975
00:37:02.806 --> 00:37:06.309
So I'm guessing that
"How was rehearsal?"

976
00:37:06.351 --> 00:37:07.352
would be a dumb question.

977
00:37:07.394 --> 00:37:08.728
[she chuckles]

978
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:12.315
Danielle is finally
starting to warm up to me.

979
00:37:12.357 --> 00:37:13.983
and then this happened.

980
00:37:14.025 --> 00:37:16.069
Well. warming up to you
is not difficult.

981
00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:20.323
Just relax
and let people see you.

982
00:37:21.658 --> 00:37:23.535
Danielle thinks
that I'm a mess.

983
00:37:23.576 --> 00:37:25.995
Why on Earth
would she think that?

984
00:37:26.037 --> 00:37:27.247
[laughing]

985
00:37:27.288 --> 00:37:29.457
Ow! I'm kidding.

986
00:37:30.792 --> 00:37:32.502
Honestly. you...

987
00:37:32.544 --> 00:37:33.878
you amaze me

988
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.630
with everything you manage
to get done on your own.

989
00:37:35.672 --> 00:37:39.926
and if this lady
can't see that.

990
00:37:39.968 --> 00:37:43.304
see how amazing you are.
then she's...

991
00:37:44.305 --> 00:37:45.974
...she's blind.

992
00:37:47.517 --> 00:37:48.893
[inhaling deeply]

993
00:37:48.935 --> 00:37:50.395
Okay.

994
00:37:50.437 --> 00:37:52.355
Um. are you gonna go. or...

995
00:37:52.397 --> 00:37:53.898
Uh. no.

996
00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.276
I was gonna get another...

997
00:37:56.317 --> 00:37:58.403
ice pack...

998
00:37:58.445 --> 00:37:59.612
unless. should I go?

999
00:37:59.654 --> 00:38:01.072
No.

1000
00:38:01.114 --> 00:38:02.741
No. um.

1001
00:38:02.782 --> 00:38:04.701
I think I should maybe
just put some pressure on it.

1002
00:38:04.743 --> 00:38:06.161
[Sam] You sure?

1003
00:38:06.202 --> 00:38:07.912
You think that's a good ide...
Oh. whoa. whoa. whoa!

1004
00:38:07.954 --> 00:38:08.913
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

1005
00:38:08.955 --> 00:38:10.206
Sorry.

1006
00:38:10.248 --> 00:38:13.251
[***]

1007
00:38:13.293 --> 00:38:15.378
[Phillip] Mom!

1008
00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.255
I'm coming.

1009
00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.178
Good night. Claire.

1010
00:38:23.219 --> 00:38:25.138
Good night. Sam.

1011

* Mm. mm *

1014

to his own beat *

1016
00:38:50.789 --> 00:38:53.291
Uh... okay.
Who do we have next here?

1017
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:54.334
Pardon me.

1018
00:38:54.376 --> 00:38:55.585
Claire Ryan?

1019
00:38:55.627 --> 00:38:56.961
That's me.

1020
00:38:57.003 --> 00:38:59.547
Hey. Claire. And your partner.
Danielle Smith?

1021
00:38:59.589 --> 00:39:01.341
Danielle! I'm here.

1022
00:39:01.383 --> 00:39:02.759
You're late.

1023
00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:04.636
I'm rubbing off on you.

1024
00:39:04.678 --> 00:39:07.305
[hushed] Don't make me laugh.
I'm nervous!

1025
00:39:07.347 --> 00:39:09.140
Okay. Uh. Dream Moms.

1026
00:39:09.182 --> 00:39:10.767
[both] That's us.

1027
00:39:10.809 --> 00:39:12.769
Hey. you're up.

1028
00:39:12.811 --> 00:39:14.396

* Yeah. and use my name *

* Yeah. can you feel it? *

1040

* It's gettin' closer
and closer and closer *

1041

your perseverance.
your passion.

1064

Unfortunately.
for most of you.

1065
00:40:58.917 --> 00:41:00.877
this will be
the end of your journey.

1066
00:41:00.919 --> 00:41:02.712
but please don't
let that stop you.

1067
00:41:02.754 --> 00:41:04.756
You got to keep
persevering. okay?

1068
00:41:04.798 --> 00:41:06.883
Out of the remaining contestants

00:41:43.628 --> 00:41:45.797
Did he just say May 27th?

1089
00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:47.340
Yeah.

1090
00:41:47.382 --> 00:41:50.468
[***]

1091
00:41:58.518 --> 00:41:59.978
[***]

1092
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.439
* Now are you getting enough *

1093
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:05.191
* Now are you ready? *

1094
00:42:05.233 --> 00:42:07.694
* K-keep it. keep it movin' *

1095
00:42:07.736 --> 00:42:10.071
* 'Cause we just got started *

1096
00:42:11.656 --> 00:42:14.242
* Now are you getting enough *

1097
00:42:14.284 --> 00:42:15.368
* Now are you ready? *

1098
00:42:16.661 --> 00:42:18.288
* K-keep it. keep it movin' *

1099
00:42:18.329 --> 00:42:20.874
* Movin'. movin'. movin' *

1100
00:42:20.915 --> 00:42:22.959
* Fire it up *

1101
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:26.004
* It's about to get crazy *

1102
00:42:26.046 --> 00:42:27.339
* Fire it up *

1103
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:29.466
-[thump]
-Ooh!

1104
00:42:29.507 --> 00:42:31.968
Claire. what are you doing
here alone at night?

1105
00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:33.386
[call ringing]

1106
00:42:33.428 --> 00:42:34.596
Hello?

1107
00:42:34.637 --> 00:42:36.014
Hey.

1108
00:42:36.056 --> 00:42:37.557
I was wondering

1109
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:39.225
if you guys wanted to come
for dinner tomorrow night.

1110
00:42:39.267 --> 00:42:41.144
Tomorrow's actually
pretty light.

1111
00:42:41.186 --> 00:42:42.479
besides rehearsal.

1112
00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.730
Okay.

1113
00:42:43.772 --> 00:42:45.732
You know. we've been
working so hard.

1114
00:42:45.774 --> 00:42:49.903
I thought it'd be really nice
to take a night off.

1115
00:42:49.944 --> 00:42:51.654
I need to talk to you
about something.

1116
00:42:51.696 --> 00:42:53.114
Besides.

1117
00:42:53.156 --> 00:42:55.325
I've had a really hard time
with my boss today.

1118
00:42:55.367 --> 00:42:57.535
so why don't we just
take a night and have fun?

1119
00:42:58.787 --> 00:43:00.455
Okay.

1120
00:43:00.497 --> 00:43:01.956
Let's chat tomorrow.

1121
00:43:01.998 --> 00:43:03.500
Okay.

1122
00:43:13.051 --> 00:43:15.053
Paul. where's Phillip?

1123
00:43:15.095 --> 00:43:16.262
I want him to start
chopping up the salad.

1124
00:43:16.304 --> 00:43:18.056
All I want to chop
is this tie.

1125
00:43:18.098 --> 00:43:19.474
Do I have to wear this thing?

1126
00:43:20.642 --> 00:43:22.185
Phillip's insisting
on tying his own tie.

1127
00:43:22.227 --> 00:43:23.561
He's been up there
for. like. 20 minutes.

1128
00:43:23.603 --> 00:43:24.896
Okay. then you chop the salad.

1129
00:43:27.357 --> 00:43:28.525
[timer dinging]

1130
00:43:28.566 --> 00:43:31.361
Um. is that the chicken
or the potatoes?

1131
00:43:31.403 --> 00:43:33.822
Uh. are those supposed
to be doing something?

1132
00:43:33.863 --> 00:43:35.407
Yeah. they're supposed
to have done something.

1133
00:43:35.448 --> 00:43:37.617
Here. Stick a fork in them.
see if they're ready.

1134
00:43:40.578 --> 00:43:41.996
Paul.

1135
00:43:42.038 --> 00:43:44.416
love of my life...

1136
00:43:44.457 --> 00:43:47.752
did you turn the burner on when
I said to start the potatoes?

1137
00:43:47.794 --> 00:43:49.713
Y-you just told me
to put them on the stove.

1138
00:43:49.754 --> 00:43:52.173
We really need
to get you into that school.

1139
00:43:52.215 --> 00:43:54.092
Very funny.

1140
00:43:54.134 --> 00:43:56.970
How's that essay going along.
by the way?

1141
00:43:57.012 --> 00:43:59.139
-[starting burner]
-Uh. a lot like the potatoes...

1142
00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.890
not done.

1143
00:44:00.932 --> 00:44:02.726
Very funny.

1144
00:44:02.767 --> 00:44:04.144
The chicken!

1145
00:44:04.185 --> 00:44:05.562
-[door opening]
-[Sam] Hey!

1146
00:44:05.603 --> 00:44:07.439
Turns out I didn't
have any cornstarch.

1147
00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.109
but I had creamed corn.
and. uh... these guys.

1148
00:44:11.151 --> 00:44:13.194
[Claire] Hi. Come on in.

1149
00:44:13.236 --> 00:44:14.571
Phillip. what are you doing?

1150
00:44:14.612 --> 00:44:16.489
Me and Quinn
are searching for ingredients.

1151
00:44:16.531 --> 00:44:18.033
Okay. put
that thing on properly.

1152
00:44:18.074 --> 00:44:20.076
Can you guys help me
clean up. please?

1153
00:44:20.118 --> 00:44:21.494
Hi! What do you need from us?

1154
00:44:21.536 --> 00:44:23.371
What do you
want us to do?

1155
00:44:23.413 --> 00:44:24.497
Well. don't worry about us.

1156
00:44:24.539 --> 00:44:26.332
You just. um.
you just act naturally.

1157
00:44:26.374 --> 00:44:27.751
You know. pretend like
we're not even here.

1158
00:44:27.792 --> 00:44:29.586
We just want to kind of
capture what you're doing

1159
00:44:29.627 --> 00:44:31.296
in your natural environment

1160
00:44:31.338 --> 00:44:32.756
and really just share it
with the world. okay?

1161
00:44:32.797 --> 00:44:33.757
So you're doing great.

1162
00:44:33.798 --> 00:44:35.008
You just go about
your normal life.

1163
00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:36.551
Do you want to grab in there
for a two-shot?

1164
00:44:36.593 --> 00:44:38.470
Okay. whenever you're ready.
though. guys.

1165
00:44:38.511 --> 00:44:40.430
Okay. I found
the cornstarch.

1166
00:44:42.223 --> 00:44:43.683
[sighing]

1167
00:44:45.018 --> 00:44:47.437
[quietly]
Okay. so... just relax.

1168
00:44:47.479 --> 00:44:49.898
Um. don't try so hard.
You know. just be yourself.

1169
00:44:49.939 --> 00:44:50.940
Okay.

1170
00:44:50.982 --> 00:44:53.318
Um. not too much.

1171
00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.403
All righty!

1172
00:44:55.445 --> 00:44:57.655
Okay. I need...
a half sweet onion.

1173
00:44:57.697 --> 00:44:59.908
fresh basil.
stick of butter.

1174
00:44:59.949 --> 00:45:01.576
and heavy cream.

1175
00:45:01.618 --> 00:45:03.370
Okay. I have dried basil.

1176
00:45:03.411 --> 00:45:05.330
a can of crispy fried onions.

1177
00:45:05.372 --> 00:45:07.457
butter. and then.

1178
00:45:07.499 --> 00:45:09.793
there's at least two cans of
evaporated milk in the pantry.

1179
00:45:09.834 --> 00:45:10.919
I didn't have time

1180
00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.711
to get groceries
because I was rehearsing.

1181
00:45:11.753 --> 00:45:13.463
It's perfect.

1182
00:45:15.382 --> 00:45:17.384
It's not perfect.
This is a disaster.

1183
00:45:17.425 --> 00:45:18.885
No. this is family.

1184
00:45:18.927 --> 00:45:22.389
This is what happens
when I don't try too hard.

1185
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.933
Yeah. and it's beautiful...
just like you.

1186
00:45:26.017 --> 00:45:27.352
[Brian] Aw. that was good.

1187
00:45:27.394 --> 00:45:30.438
That was good.
That was so. so. so. so good.

1188
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.564
Can you do that line again?

1189
00:45:31.606 --> 00:45:33.817
The. um... so. "just like you"?

1190
00:45:33.858 --> 00:45:35.819
You said just.
"Perfect. just like you."

1191
00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.195
Yeah. try it. try it. try it.
-[doorbell ringing]

1192
00:45:37.237 --> 00:45:38.363
Okay.

1193
00:45:38.405 --> 00:45:42.409
Dinner is... served.

1194
00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:44.577
Mark. why don't
you carve the chicken?

1195
00:45:44.619 --> 00:45:45.495
Gladly.

1196
00:45:45.537 --> 00:45:46.955
[Paul] No. no. it's okay.

1197
00:45:46.996 --> 00:45:48.623
I'll go.

1198
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.127
Here. let me do it.
Let me do it.

1199
00:45:52.168 --> 00:45:53.878
I got you.
I got you.

1200
00:45:57.924 --> 00:46:00.051
Uh. maybe it's this angle.

1201
00:46:00.093 --> 00:46:01.511
I had a...
-Oh. yes. yes.

1202
00:46:01.553 --> 00:46:02.846
Thank you.
You know. it is tricky.

1203
00:46:02.887 --> 00:46:06.558
It's... you've got to take it.
uh. just. uh...

1204
00:46:06.599 --> 00:46:07.892
Okay. okay. okay!
Look. Look. look. look.

1205
00:46:07.934 --> 00:46:09.269
I'm sorry.

1206
00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.897
The timer had gone off.
so it's a little overdone.

1207
00:46:12.939 --> 00:46:14.691
-Ah.
-Mm-hmm.

1208
00:46:14.733 --> 00:46:17.569
Yeah. well. compared to how
she usually cooks it. it's...

1209
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:19.029
it's a lot overdone.

1210
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:21.197
[loud laughter]

1211
00:46:21.239 --> 00:46:22.282
Hey!

1212
00:46:22.323 --> 00:46:24.200
It's true.

1213
00:46:24.242 --> 00:46:25.744
Omelets all around?

1214
00:46:25.785 --> 00:46:27.620
Sounds good!

1215
00:46:27.662 --> 00:46:29.748
-[laughter]
-Seriously?

1216
00:46:31.082 --> 00:46:34.419
-[music playing]
-[conversations]

1217
00:46:36.921 --> 00:46:39.424
[***]

1218
00:46:39.466 --> 00:46:41.760
What's going on with those two?

1219
00:46:41.801 --> 00:46:42.552
Sports...

1220
00:46:42.594 --> 00:46:44.512
the great male equalizer.

1221
00:46:44.554 --> 00:46:46.514
[Danielle chuckles]

1222
00:46:46.556 --> 00:46:50.268
Not those two.
Those two.

1223
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:52.103
I know. right?

1224
00:46:52.145 --> 00:46:54.230
I have never seen him
like that.

1225
00:46:54.272 --> 00:46:57.025
Does my son have game?

1226
00:46:57.067 --> 00:46:59.235
I don't think Sandra
has talked to a teenager

1227
00:46:59.277 --> 00:47:00.403
outside of ballet

1228
00:47:00.445 --> 00:47:02.405
since winter break.

1229
00:47:02.447 --> 00:47:05.408
I don't even know
if Paul would need game

1230
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.077
to get her attention.
-[laughing]

1231
00:47:07.118 --> 00:47:08.995
Hey. she could do
a lot worse.

1232
00:47:09.037 --> 00:47:12.457
No. no. no. no. no. no.
Paul. he's adorable.

1233
00:47:12.499 --> 00:47:15.168
Well. he's about
to be a Wallford man.

1234
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:18.672
Well. speaking
of impressive men...

1235
00:47:18.713 --> 00:47:19.673
Sam.

1236
00:47:19.714 --> 00:47:23.093
Sam the neighbor.
not the man.

1237
00:47:23.134 --> 00:47:24.260
[chuckling]

1238
00:47:24.302 --> 00:47:26.930
He certainly is
the kind to...

1239
00:47:26.971 --> 00:47:30.100
make you stop by
to borrow a cup of sugar.

1240
00:47:30.141 --> 00:47:31.851
if you know what I mean.

1241
00:47:31.893 --> 00:47:35.855
I do not know what
you're talking about. Danielle.

1242
00:47:35.897 --> 00:47:37.107
[laughing]

1243
00:47:37.148 --> 00:47:39.234
You can call me Dani.

1244
00:47:41.903 --> 00:47:44.155
[***]

1245
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.954
[***]

1246
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:55.792
Exactly.

1247
00:47:55.834 --> 00:47:56.835
[RJ] Ladies...

1248
00:47:56.876 --> 00:47:59.671
you two did
a good job at round one.

1249
00:47:59.713 --> 00:48:02.465
but "good" isn't gonna be
good enough to win this thing.

1250
00:48:02.507 --> 00:48:04.759
We've got to up the game.

1251
00:48:04.801 --> 00:48:06.469
[Dani] How likely
is that to happen. RJ?

1252
00:48:06.511 --> 00:48:08.388
I mean. really.
what are the odds?

1253
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.974
[RJ] I can't say.

1254
00:48:11.016 --> 00:48:13.143
but the top three acts
from the last season

1255
00:48:13.184 --> 00:48:14.227
of America's Next Superstar

1256
00:48:14.269 --> 00:48:16.021
all got recording deals.

1257
00:48:16.062 --> 00:48:18.398
and one is even starring

1258
00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.066
in the Broadway revival
of Sweeney Todd.

1259
00:48:20.108 --> 00:48:22.068
The same thing could happen
with Take Two.

1260
00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:23.987
But there's only one way
to get the cash prize.

1261
00:48:24.029 --> 00:48:25.030
and that's to win.

1262
00:48:26.448 --> 00:48:28.199
I have an idea.

1263
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:29.576
I've been working on something.

1264
00:48:29.617 --> 00:48:31.494
It's not ready yet.
but I think it might be cute.

1265
00:48:31.536 --> 00:48:33.288
What is it?

1266
00:48:33.329 --> 00:48:34.622
I'm thinking... a look.

1267
00:48:34.664 --> 00:48:36.833
I'm working on costumes.

1268
00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:38.501
Claire. when do you
have time to do that

1269
00:48:38.543 --> 00:48:40.462
with your job. the boys?

1270
00:48:40.503 --> 00:48:42.005
I can work on that!

1271
00:48:42.047 --> 00:48:45.258
Ladies. this is bigger
than outfits.

1272
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.260
You need a new routine.

1273
00:48:47.302 --> 00:48:48.345
A new routine?

1274
00:48:48.386 --> 00:48:49.304
In three weeks?

1275
00:48:50.472 --> 00:48:51.348
[turning music player on]

1276
00:48:51.389 --> 00:48:53.933
[instrumental plays]

1277
00:49:06.112 --> 00:49:07.405
[turning music player off]

1278
00:49:07.447 --> 00:49:09.616
A song like this

1279
00:49:09.657 --> 00:49:12.202
perfectly captures
where you two are

1280
00:49:12.243 --> 00:49:14.579
as moms. as performers.

1281
00:49:16.414 --> 00:49:18.375
I could sing that.

1282
00:49:18.416 --> 00:49:19.334
I think I've got it.

1283
00:49:19.376 --> 00:49:20.543
Well...

1284
00:49:20.585 --> 00:49:22.337
you're not quite getting it.

1285
00:49:26.508 --> 00:49:29.094
This duo just
leveled up to a duet.

1286
00:49:37.936 --> 00:49:42.691
* 'Cause I'm gonna make you *

1287
00:49:42.732 --> 00:49:47.737
* I'm gonna make you
feel so alive *

1288
00:49:47.779 --> 00:49:49.948
Orenstein. I swear. I...

1289
00:49:49.989 --> 00:49:51.574
Did you make all this
with scraps?

1290
00:49:51.616 --> 00:49:52.867
Yes. I promise.

1291
00:49:52.909 --> 00:49:54.077
None of it belongs to you.

1292
00:49:54.119 --> 00:49:55.829
Mm.

1293
00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:59.165
Well. this is...

1294
00:49:59.207 --> 00:50:00.750
well...

1295
00:50:02.836 --> 00:50:04.587
I think you should
add some trim.

1296
00:50:04.629 --> 00:50:06.089
but that's just me.

1297
00:50:06.131 --> 00:50:08.049
[chuckling]

1298
00:50:09.175 --> 00:50:10.593
Well. come on!

1299
00:50:10.635 --> 00:50:13.179
You don't have all day
to dilly-dally around.

1300
00:50:13.221 --> 00:50:15.098
You know couture takes time.
my dear.

1301
00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.058
Okay.

1302
00:50:18.059 --> 00:50:19.102
Where?

1303
00:50:19.144 --> 00:50:20.979
Just. yeah...
where the trim goes.

1304
00:50:21.021 --> 00:50:23.690
Oh. right.

1305
00:50:23.732 --> 00:50:25.650
Baby. I'm sorry.
I'm so. so sorry.

1306
00:50:25.692 --> 00:50:27.444
Look. I brought
your favorite...

1307
00:50:27.485 --> 00:50:28.737
moo shu pork
and blueberries.

1308
00:50:28.778 --> 00:50:30.321
It's okay. Mom.

1309
00:50:30.363 --> 00:50:31.698
I made him
a grilled cheese.

1310
00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:32.866
It is not okay.

1311
00:50:32.907 --> 00:50:35.118
Thank you so much
for being with him.

1312
00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.536
Phillip.
you can watch some TV.

1313
00:50:36.578 --> 00:50:37.954
Two episodes.

1314
00:50:37.996 --> 00:50:39.998
You totally earned
more TV time.

1315
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.416
[exhaling]

1316
00:50:44.252 --> 00:50:46.171
I don't get it. Mom.

1317
00:50:46.212 --> 00:50:47.547
I mean. you're late
all the time now.

1318
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:49.132
but to miss an entire game?

1319
00:50:49.174 --> 00:50:50.216
That's not okay.

1320
00:50:50.258 --> 00:50:51.384
[Claire] I know.

1321
00:50:51.426 --> 00:50:52.844
You're right.
It's not okay.

1322
00:50:52.886 --> 00:50:55.305
I'm sorry.
I got caught up at work.

1323
00:50:55.347 --> 00:50:56.556
At work or at rehearsal?

1324
00:50:56.598 --> 00:50:59.517
I was at work...

1325
00:50:59.559 --> 00:51:01.227
working on my act.

1326
00:51:01.269 --> 00:51:02.437
See. Mom?
I knew it.

1327
00:51:02.479 --> 00:51:03.855
Th-this is so unfair.

1328
00:51:03.897 --> 00:51:05.231
[Claire] Unfair?

1329
00:51:05.273 --> 00:51:07.734
Paul. I know I messed up.
but how is this unfair?

1330
00:51:07.776 --> 00:51:08.735
You're always telling me.

1331
00:51:08.777 --> 00:51:10.653
"Be a man of your word. Paul.

1332
00:51:10.695 --> 00:51:12.572
You have nothing
if you don't have integrity."

1333
00:51:12.614 --> 00:51:14.657
I said I messed up.

1334
00:51:14.699 --> 00:51:16.993
Why are you so upset?
This isn't your game.

1335
00:51:17.035 --> 00:51:18.620
You know what he said to me?

1336
00:51:18.661 --> 00:51:20.205
He asked
if you missed his games.

1337
00:51:20.246 --> 00:51:23.124
you'd go to L.A. and get famous.
like Dad did.

1338
00:51:23.166 --> 00:51:25.001
[sighing]

1339
00:51:25.043 --> 00:51:26.836
Paul...

1340
00:51:26.878 --> 00:51:29.673
you know I would never
put anything above you guys.

1341
00:51:29.714 --> 00:51:32.425
But tonight you kind of did.
didn't you?

1342
00:51:35.303 --> 00:51:37.514
[sighing]

1343
00:51:43.645 --> 00:51:45.814
[***]

1344
00:51:47.899 --> 00:51:49.734
[Sandra] Mom... ugh!

1345
00:51:49.776 --> 00:51:51.986
I cannot get Boris
to give me the nod.

1346
00:51:52.028 --> 00:51:54.155
-[turns music off]
-The nod?

1347
00:51:54.197 --> 00:51:56.616
When you're doing it right
with that special savoir faire.

1348
00:51:56.658 --> 00:51:58.034
he does this thing
with his head.

1349
00:51:58.076 --> 00:51:59.285
and you just know you're "in."

1350
00:52:00.704 --> 00:52:03.373
Ah... the nod.

1351
00:52:03.415 --> 00:52:04.791
[Sandra] Yes. the nod.

1352
00:52:04.833 --> 00:52:06.668
but with me.
it's just shaking his head.

1353
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:09.963
Wait. what are you doing?

1354
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.466
Me? Nothing.

1355
00:52:13.508 --> 00:52:15.260
I mean...
[chuckling awkwardly]

1356
00:52:15.301 --> 00:52:18.638
...just this thing
your uncle has us doing.

1357
00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.223
Were you doing choreography?

1358
00:52:20.265 --> 00:52:22.851
You won't even let me
do Uncle RJ's choreography.

1359
00:52:22.892 --> 00:52:24.269
Do you even dance?

1360
00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:27.272
I had an entire performance
career before you. missy.

1361
00:52:27.313 --> 00:52:30.525
Yes! I can dance!

1362
00:52:30.567 --> 00:52:31.651
Okay. show me
what you got.

1363
00:52:31.693 --> 00:52:33.486
What. now?

1364
00:52:33.528 --> 00:52:35.697
Yes. now.

1365
00:52:35.739 --> 00:52:37.323
Okay.

1366
00:52:39.534 --> 00:52:41.995
[music starting]

1367
00:52:42.037 --> 00:52:44.456
Five. six. seven. eight.

1368
00:52:45.915 --> 00:52:48.793
Okay! Okay!
Get it. Aunt Viv.

1369
00:52:48.835 --> 00:52:50.337
Give me more. More...

1370
00:52:50.378 --> 00:52:51.087
-More?
-...fierce.

1371
00:52:51.129 --> 00:52:52.797
Fierce. Fierce. Okay.

Not bad.

[turns music off]

1380
00:53:10.648 --> 00:53:11.983
"Not bad." or "good"?

1381
00:53:12.025 --> 00:53:13.443
Let's just say

1382
00:53:13.485 --> 00:53:15.779
you and I are both gonna need
a little more practice

1383
00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:17.864
before we earn
the Boris nod...

1384
00:53:17.906 --> 00:53:20.075
as long as he's nodding
on showcase night.

1385
00:53:21.826 --> 00:53:24.287
Uh... about that. baby.

1386
00:53:25.455 --> 00:53:27.374
Um...

1387
00:53:27.415 --> 00:53:29.918
I know this showcase
is important to you.

1388
00:53:29.959 --> 00:53:31.044
[Sandra] Important?

1389
00:53:31.086 --> 00:53:32.379
Only the performance

1390
00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.923
that will determine
the fate of my entire life.

1391
00:53:37.008 --> 00:53:38.635
Is everything okay?

1392
00:53:40.345 --> 00:53:41.554
No problem.

1393
00:53:41.596 --> 00:53:42.639
No problem at all.

1394
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.476
Great job today. kiddo.

1395
00:53:46.518 --> 00:53:47.852
Thanks. Mom.

1396
00:53:47.894 --> 00:53:49.396
Okay. so I have
rehearsal again tonight.

1397
00:53:49.437 --> 00:53:51.022
but your brother's
gonna order food...

1398
00:53:51.064 --> 00:53:52.440
hopefully something healthy.

1399
00:53:52.482 --> 00:53:53.358
[Sam] Oh. hey!

1400
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.567
Slow down there.

1401
00:53:54.609 --> 00:53:56.444
How's it going?

1402
00:53:56.486 --> 00:53:57.696
Ahem.

1403
00:53:59.614 --> 00:54:01.574
Uh. say. Paul.

1404
00:54:01.616 --> 00:54:03.284
I was just gonna go. uh.

1405
00:54:03.326 --> 00:54:04.911
shoot some hoops.

1406
00:54:04.953 --> 00:54:06.454
Want a bit of one-on-one?

1407
00:54:08.039 --> 00:54:09.958
All right. yeah. sure. Whatever.

1408
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.918
Okay. There you go.

1409
00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.837
Let's do it.

1410
00:54:13.878 --> 00:54:15.338
Thank you.

1411
00:54:23.847 --> 00:54:25.598
Nice.

1412
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.600
You should
get mad more often.

1413
00:54:27.642 --> 00:54:29.352
[scoffing]
Who said I was mad?

1414
00:54:30.937 --> 00:54:32.105
I thought
it was pretty obvious...

1415
00:54:32.147 --> 00:54:34.149
that. and your mom
might've mentioned

1416
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:36.651
you guys
kind of had a fight.

1417
00:54:36.693 --> 00:54:37.819
[backboard banging]

1418
00:54:37.861 --> 00:54:39.529
I can't believe
she told you that.

1419
00:54:39.571 --> 00:54:41.906
Did she tell you she completely
missed Phillip's game?

1420
00:54:41.948 --> 00:54:42.949
[Sam] Yeah. Yeah. she did.

1421
00:54:42.991 --> 00:54:44.242
She feels terrible.

1422
00:54:44.284 --> 00:54:45.744
I mean. she's trying her best.

1423
00:54:45.785 --> 00:54:47.495
Is she?

1424
00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:52.042
Because it seems like
she's hardly around lately.

1425
00:54:52.083 --> 00:54:53.501
Well. you know.
your mom. she...

1426
00:54:53.543 --> 00:54:56.296
she dedicates
her entire life to you kids.

1427
00:54:56.338 --> 00:54:58.840
She's just trying
to do something for herself.

1428
00:54:58.882 --> 00:55:01.593
You really gonna
hold that against her?

1429
00:55:03.053 --> 00:55:05.263
I'm not trying
to be a jerk.

1430
00:55:05.305 --> 00:55:08.016
Oh...
well. you know. try harder.

1431
00:55:08.058 --> 00:55:09.934
I'm glad
she's doing the show.

1432
00:55:09.976 --> 00:55:12.187
I-I want her to win.

1433
00:55:12.228 --> 00:55:14.647
I-I just don't want her
to win for me.

1434
00:55:18.234 --> 00:55:19.402
Why not?

1435
00:55:20.612 --> 00:55:23.656
She's so set on me
becoming a Wallford man.

1436
00:55:23.698 --> 00:55:25.075
What if I won't fit in?

1437
00:55:25.116 --> 00:55:26.659
Not possible.

1438
00:55:26.701 --> 00:55:29.454
What? That I won't fit in.
or I won't disappoint my mom?

1439
00:55:29.496 --> 00:55:30.997
Bit of both.

1440
00:55:31.039 --> 00:55:32.707
She wouldn't be trying so hard
to get you there otherwise.

1441
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:37.671
That's just it.
She's... she's trying so hard.

1442
00:55:37.712 --> 00:55:39.339
It's a lot of pressure.

1443
00:55:39.381 --> 00:55:42.384
I-I don't know how kids
at these schools make it work.

1444
00:55:42.425 --> 00:55:43.426
Like Sandra.

1445
00:55:43.468 --> 00:55:44.844
She says
when she first started.

1446
00:55:44.886 --> 00:55:47.097
everyone treated her
like an outsider.

1447
00:55:47.138 --> 00:55:49.891
Now she's on her way
to a professional company.

1448
00:55:49.933 --> 00:55:52.852
and I can't even
handle prep school.

1449
00:55:52.894 --> 00:55:54.688
[backboard banging]

1450
00:55:54.729 --> 00:55:56.189
Well...

1451
00:55:56.231 --> 00:55:58.149
Sandra's a hard worker.

1452
00:55:58.191 --> 00:56:00.735
But so are you.

1453
00:56:00.777 --> 00:56:01.986
You get that from your mom.

1454
00:56:02.028 --> 00:56:03.988
So...

1455
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:06.574
you like Sandra. huh?

1456
00:56:06.616 --> 00:56:08.868
[chuckling awkwardly]

1457
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.912
Who said that?

1458
00:56:10.954 --> 00:56:13.206
I think you just did.

1459
00:56:13.248 --> 00:56:14.916
You should ask her out.

1460
00:56:14.958 --> 00:56:16.209
[laughing]

1461
00:56:16.251 --> 00:56:18.253
Really? Relationship advice
coming from you?

1462
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.049
What?

1463
00:56:23.091 --> 00:56:25.301
I know a lot
about relationships.

1464
00:56:25.343 --> 00:56:27.053
[scoffing] Are you
listening to yourself?

1465
00:56:27.095 --> 00:56:29.556
What are you
talking about?

1466
00:56:31.307 --> 00:56:32.517
What?

1467
00:56:32.559 --> 00:56:34.019
I'm a kid...

1468
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:36.104
not an idiot.

1469
00:56:40.984 --> 00:56:42.986
I see the way
you look at my mom.

1470
00:56:43.028 --> 00:56:44.404
She never lets anyone help her.

1471
00:56:44.446 --> 00:56:45.697
but that doesn't
stop you from trying.

1472
00:56:47.574 --> 00:56:48.575
"Try harder."

1473
00:56:49.951 --> 00:56:51.453
Take your shot. man.

1474
00:56:52.954 --> 00:56:56.249
Relationship advice
from a 16-year-old.

1475
00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:03.340
Well. look who's early!

1476
00:57:03.381 --> 00:57:04.591
Well. the early bird
catches the worm.

1477
00:57:04.632 --> 00:57:06.968
and I need about
a third of 100.000 worms.

1478
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:10.305
You can have worms and...

1479
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.641
...ah. wardrobe!

1480
00:57:13.683 --> 00:57:15.393
Isn't it fabulous?

1481
00:57:15.435 --> 00:57:18.104
That looks like
it's a month's rent.

1482
00:57:18.146 --> 00:57:19.189
Oh. don't worry about it.

1483
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:20.982
It's a gift...

1484
00:57:21.024 --> 00:57:22.609
for you.

1485
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:24.361
for us.

1486
00:57:24.402 --> 00:57:26.780
I just wanted
to take it off your plate.

1487
00:57:29.115 --> 00:57:31.576
What's with that look. Claire?

1488
00:57:31.618 --> 00:57:34.204
We were just talking
about new costumes. and...

1489
00:57:34.245 --> 00:57:36.581
Oh. you showed her the robes!

1490
00:57:36.623 --> 00:57:38.416
What robes?

1491
00:57:42.379 --> 00:57:44.005
Oh...

1492
00:57:44.047 --> 00:57:46.800
I thought you meant
like "robes."

1493
00:57:48.051 --> 00:57:51.137
It's... an actual robe.

1494
00:57:51.179 --> 00:57:54.140
It's not just a robe.

1495
00:57:54.182 --> 00:57:56.559
It's a whole concept.

1496
00:57:56.601 --> 00:58:00.021
I put a lot of time
and labor into these.

1497
00:58:00.063 --> 00:58:01.898
I was just
trying to help.

1498
00:58:12.867 --> 00:58:13.952
[Mark] Hello.

1499
00:58:13.993 --> 00:58:15.495
What happened?

1500
00:58:15.537 --> 00:58:16.746
Oh. Jameson basically told me

1501
00:58:16.788 --> 00:58:19.249
that I've got partner
in the bag!

1502
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:20.333
Oh. baby!

1503
00:58:20.375 --> 00:58:23.086
I'm so proud of you!

1504
00:58:23.128 --> 00:58:24.004
When is it a done deal?

1505
00:58:24.045 --> 00:58:25.255
I'm not sure.

1506
00:58:25.296 --> 00:58:27.173
but I've invited him
to Sandra's showcase

1507
00:58:27.215 --> 00:58:28.675
to kind of seal it up.

1508
00:58:28.717 --> 00:58:30.385
I mean. he's always talking
about how important it is

1509
00:58:30.427 --> 00:58:32.345
for the firm to be
a pillar of the community.

1510
00:58:32.387 --> 00:58:33.638
and nothing says
"community support"

1511
00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.849
like a supportive family.

1512
00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:37.183
On the 27th. right?

1513
00:58:37.225 --> 00:58:38.852
Right.

1514
00:58:38.893 --> 00:58:40.395
What's wrong?

1515
00:58:40.437 --> 00:58:42.439
It is on the 27th. right?

1516
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.316
I-I put it in my calendar
like you told me.

1517
00:58:45.358 --> 00:58:47.444
Yeah. Sandra's showcase
is on the 27th.

1518
00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:50.739
And so is mine.

1519
00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:53.199
Oh. Dani.

1520
00:58:53.241 --> 00:58:54.159
I didn't know
what to tell you.

1521
00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:55.368
Me?

1522
00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:57.245
I didn't know
what to tell Claire.

1523
00:58:57.287 --> 00:58:58.413
Well. that one's easy.

1524
00:58:58.455 --> 00:59:00.707
Tell her
you're devoted to your family.

1525
00:59:00.749 --> 00:59:03.209
And what about her family?
She needs the money!

1526
00:59:03.251 --> 00:59:05.337
I mean. she'll figure it out.

1527
00:59:05.378 --> 00:59:07.339
I mean. and Paul's up
for a scholarship. right?

1528
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:09.174
-Yeah. but I...
-Dani.

1529
00:59:09.215 --> 00:59:11.217
[sighing]

1530
00:59:11.259 --> 00:59:12.552
I said I...

1531
00:59:12.594 --> 00:59:14.054
I know. I...

1532
00:59:14.095 --> 00:59:15.597
I will take care of it.

1533
00:59:15.638 --> 00:59:16.765
Okay.

1534
00:59:16.806 --> 00:59:18.933
I'll... I'll just go
put these in water.

1535
00:59:22.228 --> 00:59:23.938
[sighing]

1536
00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:25.398
[***]

1537
00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.067
[fence rattling]

1538
00:59:30.028 --> 00:59:31.404
Are we supposed to be here?

1539
00:59:31.446 --> 00:59:32.989
We're good.
I wanted to show you

1540
00:59:33.031 --> 00:59:34.741
this special place
my family used to come to.

1541
00:59:34.783 --> 00:59:36.451
Okay.

1542
00:59:38.328 --> 00:59:41.414
Come on.

1543
00:59:41.456 --> 00:59:43.124
I thought
this would be a good spot

1544
00:59:43.166 --> 00:59:44.959
to film
your next TikTok video.

1545
00:59:45.001 --> 00:59:47.128
I... I could help with it.

1546
00:59:48.296 --> 00:59:49.673
[she chuckles]

1547
00:59:49.714 --> 00:59:51.591
Laying it on a little thick.
huh?

1548
00:59:52.676 --> 00:59:54.386
I am trying to impress you.

1549
00:59:54.427 --> 00:59:56.554
I've actually
never been here before.

1550
00:59:56.596 --> 00:59:57.972
Jumping a fence?

1551
00:59:58.014 --> 00:59:59.391
My mom would be mortified.

1552
00:59:59.432 --> 01:00:00.767
[they chuckle]

1553
01:00:00.809 --> 01:00:02.602
You know you're gonna be
a star one day. right?

1554
01:00:02.644 --> 01:00:05.939
Ah. so that's what
the starlit tour is all about...

1555
01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.524
my inevitable stardom?

1556
01:00:07.565 --> 01:00:10.610
The first step
is my showcase.

1557
01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:12.320
How do you do it. Sandra?

1558
01:00:12.362 --> 01:00:14.781
Do what?

1559
01:00:14.823 --> 01:00:17.283
Keep the nerves from
making you just go A.W.O.L.?

1560
01:00:17.325 --> 01:00:20.370
I guess
I care about it more

1561
01:00:20.412 --> 01:00:22.122
than I care
what people think about me.

1562
01:00:22.163 --> 01:00:23.748
Except Boris.

1563
01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:26.459
I care what Boris
thinks about me.

1564
01:00:26.501 --> 01:00:28.586
All right.
let's see what you got.

1565
01:00:28.628 --> 01:00:30.255
I bet this video
will get enough likes

1566
01:00:30.296 --> 01:00:31.381
to shut down
any doubters...

1567
01:00:31.423 --> 01:00:33.258
especially Boris.

1568
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:42.392
Ow!

1569
01:00:42.434 --> 01:00:43.768
Aah!
-Wait. are you all right?

1570
01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:46.146
Yeah. I just twisted my ankle.

1571
01:00:46.187 --> 01:00:47.647
[guard] Hey!

1572
01:00:48.606 --> 01:00:49.899
You can't be here.

1573
01:00:49.941 --> 01:00:50.900
Just go. Run!

1574
01:00:50.942 --> 01:00:52.277
I'm not
gonna leave you here.

1575
01:00:52.318 --> 01:00:53.778
[guard] Ah.

1576
01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.905
You two just stay right here.

1577
01:00:57.907 --> 01:01:00.493
[phone ringing]

1578
01:01:00.535 --> 01:01:01.578
[Claire] Hello?

1579
01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:02.996
He did what?

1580
01:01:03.038 --> 01:01:04.789
Okay.

1581
01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:06.082
Thank you for being there.

1582
01:01:06.124 --> 01:01:08.043
I'm gonna come now.
I'll be right there. Bye.

1583
01:01:10.295 --> 01:01:12.380
Oh. where do you
think you're going?

1584
01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:14.049
Still lots of work to do.

1585
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:15.508
Orenstein. I gotta go.

1586
01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:16.968
It's my kid.

1587
01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:18.428
Family first.

1588
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.638
I get it.

1589
01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.474
All right.
Get out of here.

1590
01:01:22.515 --> 01:01:23.683
[chuckling]
-Thank you.

1591
01:01:23.725 --> 01:01:25.143
-Yeah.
-I really appreciate it.

1592
01:01:25.185 --> 01:01:25.935
Okay.

1593
01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:31.566
[inhaling sharply]

1594
01:01:38.406 --> 01:01:40.992
Hey. uh. so he called me

1595
01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:43.286
because he was embarrassed
to tell you.

1596
01:01:43.328 --> 01:01:45.288
so maybe go easy on him.

1597
01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:46.790
[snapping]
What is going on. Paul?

1598
01:01:46.831 --> 01:01:50.126
Mom. I-I can explain.
It...

1599
01:01:50.168 --> 01:01:51.961
Sandra Yvette Smith!

1600
01:01:52.003 --> 01:01:53.797
Mom...

1601
01:01:53.838 --> 01:01:56.383
Are you okay?
How's your foot?

1602
01:01:56.424 --> 01:01:58.385
It's just my toe.
and it's fine.

1603
01:01:58.426 --> 01:02:00.261
It's not as bad as it looks.

1604
01:02:00.303 --> 01:02:03.139
It's actually
really very sweet.

1605
01:02:03.181 --> 01:02:04.641
[Dani] Save it!

1606
01:02:04.683 --> 01:02:06.976
Your father will have plenty
to say about this. Plenty!

1607
01:02:07.018 --> 01:02:09.062
And I'm gonna
deal with you later.

1608
01:02:09.104 --> 01:02:11.356
These rehearsals are putting
a strain on our family.

1609
01:02:11.398 --> 01:02:14.401
Clearly. we have to put
our attention back on our kids.

1610
01:02:14.442 --> 01:02:15.318
Dani. come on!

1611
01:02:16.569 --> 01:02:17.487
Mom... Mom...

1612
01:02:17.529 --> 01:02:18.738
Please.

1613
01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:21.408
Come on.

1614
01:02:21.449 --> 01:02:23.993
[***]

1615
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.748
[Claire] Oh. how is

1616
01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:31.918
your half-caf low-fat
Americano misto?

1617
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.670
[sighing] I know.
It's an embarrassing order.

1618
01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:36.214
but I kinda like
that you know it.

1619
01:02:36.256 --> 01:02:38.883
I listen too.

1620
01:02:38.925 --> 01:02:41.136
This is a beautiful park.

1621
01:02:41.177 --> 01:02:43.054
I've never actually
been here before.

1622
01:02:43.096 --> 01:02:44.973
Yeah. I used to come here
with the kids

1623
01:02:45.015 --> 01:02:46.433
all the time
when they were younger.

1624
01:02:46.474 --> 01:02:48.643
A lot of good memories here.

1625
01:02:49.686 --> 01:02:51.604
Now a bad one too.

1626
01:02:51.646 --> 01:02:54.941
I cannot believe
Paul did that.

1627
01:02:54.983 --> 01:02:57.569
Maybe he's right. Maybe I...

1628
01:02:57.610 --> 01:02:59.779
Maybe I'm not being
present enough as a mom.

1629
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:01.906
No. hey. listen.
You're a great mom.

1630
01:03:04.993 --> 01:03:08.288
I want to thank you
for always being there.

1631
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:11.458
I know I'm not always the best
at asking for help.

1632
01:03:11.499 --> 01:03:12.667
Oh. really?

1633
01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:15.211
Hadn't noticed.

1634
01:03:15.253 --> 01:03:17.589
[they chuckle]

1635
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:20.925
No. look. I...
I get it. I do.

1636
01:03:20.967 --> 01:03:23.720
You've had to do
everything on your own.

1637
01:03:23.762 --> 01:03:26.389
It's hard to allow yourself
to depend on anyone.

1638
01:03:28.683 --> 01:03:30.477
I just want you to know
that when you're ready to.

1639
01:03:30.518 --> 01:03:33.021
you can... depend on me.

1640
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:39.194
Good to know.

1641
01:03:39.235 --> 01:03:41.696
[***]

1642
01:03:46.618 --> 01:03:48.495
[television theme song playing]

1643
01:03:48.536 --> 01:03:50.080
Come on. Mom!
You're on.

1644
01:03:50.121 --> 01:03:54.876
[***]

1645
01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:57.128
Welcome toTake Two
Recap and Tell-All

1646
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:58.296
that will take us

1647
01:03:58.338 --> 01:04:00.090
to next week's
final ofTake Two.

1648
01:04:00.131 --> 01:04:01.257
"Tell-all"?

1649
01:04:01.299 --> 01:04:04.094
Kicking off the tell-all
are two moms...

1650
01:04:04.135 --> 01:04:07.097
the elders of this
inauguralTake Two season.

1651
01:04:07.138 --> 01:04:08.682
who are looking at
their second chance

1652
01:04:08.723 --> 01:04:11.142
to make their dreams
come true...

1653
01:04:11.184 --> 01:04:12.852
the Dream Moms.

1654
01:04:12.894 --> 01:04:15.522
I've been on my own
for over a decade now.

1655
01:04:15.563 --> 01:04:17.941
It's just been
my sons and me

1656
01:04:17.982 --> 01:04:20.485
and my work.
and nowTake Two.

1657
01:04:20.527 --> 01:04:22.153
and this is really
my opportunity

1658
01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:24.698
at making two of my biggest
dreams come true...

1659
01:04:24.739 --> 01:04:27.575
my dream of putting
my son through school

1660
01:04:27.617 --> 01:04:29.828
and becoming
a professional dancer.

1661
01:04:29.869 --> 01:04:31.204
[Brian] Is that where

1662
01:04:31.246 --> 01:04:33.373
the "dream"
in "Dream Moms" come in?

1663
01:04:33.415 --> 01:04:35.875
Kind of.
Not exactly.

1664
01:04:35.917 --> 01:04:39.045
That really came
from my partner. Danielle.

1665
01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:40.714
[Brian]
Danielle Smith...

1666
01:04:40.755 --> 01:04:42.382
a one-time
off-Broadway performer

1667
01:04:42.424 --> 01:04:43.591
and backup singer

1668
01:04:43.633 --> 01:04:45.218
for Ray Gray
and the Doo-Wops.

1669
01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.471
and a mother of a rising star
in the ballet world.

1670
01:04:48.513 --> 01:04:52.267
I had an entire performance
career before you. missy.

1671
01:04:52.308 --> 01:04:54.019
[Brian] You must be
really proud of your daughter.

1672
01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:55.562
Yes!

1673
01:04:55.603 --> 01:04:56.688
Definitely.

1674
01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:57.814
Watch this.

1675
01:04:57.856 --> 01:05:01.109
[***]

1676
01:05:01.151 --> 01:05:03.528
She has
a performance coming up.

1677
01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:04.779
[Brian] I take it

1678
01:05:04.821 --> 01:05:06.448
you're very excited
to see her perform?

1679
01:05:07.782 --> 01:05:10.201
Do you even dance?

1680
01:05:10.243 --> 01:05:12.203
Yes. I can dance!

1681
01:05:12.245 --> 01:05:14.330
Dinner is served.

1682
01:05:14.372 --> 01:05:15.832
[Brian] And how was
dinner at Clai?

1683
01:05:15.874 --> 01:05:17.375
Did you enjoy her cooking?

1684
01:05:18.668 --> 01:05:20.587
[Brian]
Will this mother's dreams

1685
01:05:20.628 --> 01:05:22.881
be threatened by
her da's rising star?

1686
01:05:22.922 --> 01:05:25.258
Tune in next
to find out.

1687
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.676
I'm Brian Breacrest.

1688
01:05:26.718 --> 01:05:27.927
and we'll catch you
when we're looking at ya...

1689
01:05:27.969 --> 01:05:29.846
next week onTake Two.

1690
01:05:29.888 --> 01:05:31.348
I don't believe this.

1691
01:05:31.389 --> 01:05:34.517
Mom. this is awful
and totally untrue.

1692
01:05:34.559 --> 01:05:36.519
[show outro finishes]

1693
01:05:36.561 --> 01:05:38.563
Excuse me.

1694
01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:50.367
[call ringing]

1695
01:05:50.408 --> 01:05:52.452
[phone buzzing]

1696
01:05:52.494 --> 01:05:54.245
Hello. Claire?

1697
01:05:54.287 --> 01:05:55.789
Are you seeing this?

1698
01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:57.791
It's a lot.

1699
01:05:57.832 --> 01:05:59.125
It's a hatchet job!

1700
01:05:59.167 --> 01:06:01.252
They've taken everything
out of context!

1701
01:06:01.294 --> 01:06:03.254
Look. I'm sure

1702
01:06:03.296 --> 01:06:05.256
they're just
trying to get some ratings.

1703
01:06:05.298 --> 01:06:07.884
and the producers
will never see the wrap-up.

1704
01:06:07.926 --> 01:06:09.636
Do you want to know
who might see it?

1705
01:06:09.678 --> 01:06:11.971
Someone at Sandra's school.

1706
01:06:12.013 --> 01:06:14.265
or the partners
at Mark's job!

1707
01:06:14.307 --> 01:06:15.809
We look ridiculous.

1708
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:19.062
Correction. I look ridiculous.

1709
01:06:19.104 --> 01:06:21.481
They made me out to be
some kind of villain.

1710
01:06:21.523 --> 01:06:22.816
I'm sorry. Claire.

1711
01:06:22.857 --> 01:06:24.234
but I can't
go through with this.

1712
01:06:24.275 --> 01:06:25.652
Are you serious?

1713
01:06:25.694 --> 01:06:27.570
I obviously need

1714
01:06:27.612 --> 01:06:31.282
to just redirect my energy
back to where it belongs...

1715
01:06:31.324 --> 01:06:32.659
with my family.

1716
01:06:32.701 --> 01:06:33.743
Please. Dani.

1717
01:06:33.785 --> 01:06:35.829
Don't let
some bogus little video

1718
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:37.706
stop us
from our chance.

1719
01:06:37.747 --> 01:06:40.000
It's not just the show.

1720
01:06:40.041 --> 01:06:42.419
Sandra's showcase
is May 27th...

1721
01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:45.839
the same night
as the Take Twotaping.

1722
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.258
And you're just
telling me this now.

1723
01:06:48.299 --> 01:06:50.135
I didn't know what to say!
I didn't know what to do.

1724
01:06:50.176 --> 01:06:51.845
And what about my child?

1725
01:06:51.886 --> 01:06:53.430
What about him?

1726
01:06:53.471 --> 01:06:55.849
You know what
this prize money means to us.

1727
01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:57.475
Hopefully he can
get that scholarship.

1728
01:06:57.517 --> 01:06:58.810
Hope?

1729
01:06:58.852 --> 01:07:02.105
I should've given up hope
a long time ago.

1730
01:07:02.147 --> 01:07:05.066
I know that this might be
some stupid pipe dream.

1731
01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:07.360
but this is my pipe dream.

1732
01:07:07.402 --> 01:07:10.697
I should have never. ever
relied on someone else.

1733
01:07:10.739 --> 01:07:11.781
I'm sorry. Claire.

1734
01:07:11.823 --> 01:07:13.700
I can't just not show up
for my daughter.

1735
01:07:13.742 --> 01:07:16.536
Of course you can't.
but this isn't about Sandra.

1736
01:07:16.578 --> 01:07:21.207
This is about you not being
able to show up for yourself.

1737
01:07:21.249 --> 01:07:24.669
so why would I ever think
that you could show up for me?

1738
01:07:26.755 --> 01:07:29.049
[***]

1739
01:07:43.229 --> 01:07:46.691
Okay. we have leftover...

1740
01:07:46.733 --> 01:07:48.401
um. eggs.

1741
01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:50.737
I can make you
an egg-salad sandwich.

1742
01:07:50.779 --> 01:07:52.113
We're good. Mom.

1743
01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:53.406
[Claire] You sure?

1744
01:07:54.657 --> 01:07:57.160
Did you eat something?
Do you want anything?

1745
01:07:57.202 --> 01:07:59.412
Yeah. I-I do want something.

1746
01:08:01.498 --> 01:08:03.875
I want you to go
to that competition.

1747
01:08:03.917 --> 01:08:06.252
[knocking at the door]

1748
01:08:11.758 --> 01:08:13.802
-Hey.
-Hi. Sam.

1749
01:08:13.843 --> 01:08:15.387
What are you doing here?

1750
01:08:15.428 --> 01:08:19.224
Well. I'm here to help you guys
get ready for your show.

1751
01:08:19.265 --> 01:08:21.393
Okay. I think
you all have amnesia.

1752
01:08:21.434 --> 01:08:22.936
No. Mom.

1753
01:08:22.977 --> 01:08:25.563
I think you're the one who's
forgotten what you always say...

1754
01:08:25.605 --> 01:08:26.690
"the show must..."

1755
01:08:26.731 --> 01:08:28.274
"Go on"?

1756
01:08:28.316 --> 01:08:29.234
Yeah.

1757
01:08:29.275 --> 01:08:31.319
So go on. do the show.

1758
01:08:31.361 --> 01:08:33.446
Paul...

1759
01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:36.783
I really appreciate it.
but my partner left me.

1760
01:08:36.825 --> 01:08:38.326
I can't exactly
do it alone.

1761
01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:41.246
You've had partners
leave you before.

1762
01:08:41.287 --> 01:08:43.081
That's never stopped you.

1763
01:08:43.123 --> 01:08:45.625
If anything.
it's made you stronger.

1764
01:08:49.546 --> 01:08:52.132
Come on. Phillip.
Let's get dressed.

1765
01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.177
[***]

1766
01:08:57.554 --> 01:08:58.930
It's very sweet.

1767
01:08:58.972 --> 01:09:01.766
It's a nice idea.
but it's crazy.

1768
01:09:01.808 --> 01:09:04.644
Mm-hmm.

1769
01:09:04.686 --> 01:09:06.229
What is this?

1770
01:09:06.271 --> 01:09:09.566
I think this is Paul's essay.

1771
01:09:09.607 --> 01:09:12.902
He'd probably kill me
if I snooped.

1772
01:09:12.944 --> 01:09:14.320
Probably.

1773
01:09:14.362 --> 01:09:16.406
I mean. if you read it.

1774
01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:18.366
then I technically
didn't read it.

1775
01:09:18.408 --> 01:09:19.784
Uh-huh.

1776
01:09:19.826 --> 01:09:21.036
Yeah. I don't...

1777
01:09:21.077 --> 01:09:22.871
Read it. Come on. please?

1778
01:09:22.912 --> 01:09:23.913
Just read it!

1779
01:09:23.955 --> 01:09:25.623
[Sam clears his throat]

1780
01:09:25.665 --> 01:09:27.250
Okay.

1781
01:09:27.292 --> 01:09:29.044
[grumbles under his breath]

1782
01:09:29.085 --> 01:09:30.211
[clears throat]

1783
01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:38.303
"I don't know that I'm sure
of what makes a Wallford man.

1784
01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:41.848
but I know that a woman
made a man out of me."

1785
01:09:45.352 --> 01:09:48.438
"My mother works
a very demanding job.

1786
01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.483
where she makes money
and friends.

1787
01:09:51.524 --> 01:09:55.278
but now she's working
to make an old dream come true.

1788
01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.697
She never gives up...

1789
01:09:57.739 --> 01:10:01.076
on herself or on me.

1790
01:10:01.117 --> 01:10:04.996
You can say that
about every parent...

1791
01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:08.333
but I know my mom
would do anything

1792
01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:11.378
to make sure I had
the best life possible.

1793
01:10:11.419 --> 01:10:13.046
and I owe it to her

1794
01:10:13.088 --> 01:10:14.589
to do anything
for that too."

1795
01:10:18.134 --> 01:10:20.178
[voice breaking]
He wrote that?

1796
01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.389
[softly] Yeah.

1797
01:10:27.602 --> 01:10:29.521
[Paul] "When my mother
is faced with a challenge.

1798
01:10:29.562 --> 01:10:32.357
she mans up
like nobody I've ever seen.

1799
01:10:32.399 --> 01:10:33.316
and because of her.

1800
01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:34.526
I'm ready to face

1801
01:10:34.567 --> 01:10:36.194
the challenge
of college preparation.

1802
01:10:36.236 --> 01:10:37.862
which is all about
being curious.

1803
01:10:37.904 --> 01:10:39.197
taking risks.

1804
01:10:39.239 --> 01:10:40.699
learning who you really are.

1805
01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:42.450
and gaining the skill
and confidence

1806
01:10:42.492 --> 01:10:44.494
to make your dreams
a reality.

1807
01:10:44.536 --> 01:10:47.038
So to answer
the thesis question.

1808
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.207
"What makes a Wallford man?"

1809
01:10:49.249 --> 01:10:52.377
my answer is...
a mother."

1810
01:10:58.258 --> 01:11:01.261
[***]

1811
01:11:07.434 --> 01:11:09.894
I don't know
what you said to Paul

1812
01:11:09.936 --> 01:11:12.647
on the basketball court...

1813
01:11:12.689 --> 01:11:14.733
but thank you.

1814
01:11:14.774 --> 01:11:16.735
Okay.

1815
01:11:16.776 --> 01:11:19.279
Actually. he was the one
giving out the good advice.

1816
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.031
[chuckling] Oh?

1817
01:11:21.072 --> 01:11:22.198
-Yeah.
-Really?

1818
01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.867
And what was that?

1819
01:11:25.535 --> 01:11:28.496
He said it was time
I took my shot.

1820
01:11:32.959 --> 01:11:35.712
Time! I gotta go.

1821
01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:38.798
Right. Yeah.

1822
01:11:41.051 --> 01:11:43.136
To be continued?

1823
01:11:43.178 --> 01:11:44.804
Yeah.

1824
01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:47.599
Yeah.
We'll be right behind you.

1825
01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.768
Okay.

1826
01:11:56.566 --> 01:11:58.443
Sandra.

1827
01:12:01.279 --> 01:12:02.989
I'm ready.

1828
01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:05.116
You look beautiful.

1829
01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:07.744
I am so proud of you.

1830
01:12:07.786 --> 01:12:09.704
Thanks. Mom.

1831
01:12:09.746 --> 01:12:10.872
Of course. baby.

1832
01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:12.499
No. really.

1833
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:15.377
Thanks. Mom...
for everything.

1834
01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:17.712
I know how much
you sacrificed

1835
01:12:17.754 --> 01:12:20.715
for me to have the opportunities
that I have.

1836
01:12:20.757 --> 01:12:23.134
and I would
never jeopardize that.

1837
01:12:23.176 --> 01:12:24.678
I know. baby.

1838
01:12:24.719 --> 01:12:26.554
I should have never
gone out with Paul.

1839
01:12:27.597 --> 01:12:28.848
I get it.

1840
01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:31.976
No socializing. no injuries.
no boys...

1841
01:12:32.018 --> 01:12:34.312
just dance.

1842
01:12:34.354 --> 01:12:37.023
Well. yes... but no.

1843
01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:41.486
Sandra. I want you
to have a full life.

1844
01:12:41.528 --> 01:12:45.407
You gave up everything
that wasn't about me or Dad.

1845
01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:48.326
and I guess
when I have a family someday.

1846
01:12:48.368 --> 01:12:49.828
I might have to do that too.

1847
01:12:49.869 --> 01:12:51.705
Right. Mom?

1848
01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:56.584
[chuckling softly]

1849
01:12:56.626 --> 01:12:57.961
[kissing]

1850
01:12:58.003 --> 01:12:59.879
[***]

1851
01:13:03.383 --> 01:13:04.634
You almost ready?

1852
01:13:04.676 --> 01:13:06.177
Yeah.

1853
01:13:06.219 --> 01:13:08.096
I need a minute.

1854
01:13:25.238 --> 01:13:26.865
Hey.

1855
01:13:26.906 --> 01:13:27.907
[kissing]

1856
01:13:29.909 --> 01:13:31.494
You okay?

1857
01:13:36.249 --> 01:13:38.918
You know I'm proud of you.
right. Mark?

1858
01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.378
Of course.

1859
01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.422
Really proud of you.

1860
01:13:44.758 --> 01:13:47.510
I've been a team player. Mark.

1861
01:13:47.552 --> 01:13:51.056
I have kept my eye
on the prize.

1862
01:13:51.097 --> 01:13:54.100
What you
and Sandra wanted

1863
01:13:54.142 --> 01:13:56.519
became what I wanted. and...

1864
01:13:56.561 --> 01:13:58.605
what I really wanted
for myself...

1865
01:14:00.148 --> 01:14:02.150
...I let that go.

1866
01:14:02.192 --> 01:14:03.401
I never wanted that
for you

1867
01:14:03.443 --> 01:14:05.028
or for us.

1868
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:07.113
It's not you.

1869
01:14:07.155 --> 01:14:08.865
It's on me.

1870
01:14:08.907 --> 01:14:10.617
[she sighs]

1871
01:14:10.658 --> 01:14:13.870
Even this Take Twothing.

1872
01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:15.413
I started all of it

1873
01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:16.831
because I wanted
to help my brother.

1874
01:14:19.084 --> 01:14:21.586
What I didn't realize is.

1875
01:14:21.628 --> 01:14:24.756
while I was focused
on making everyone else happy.

1876
01:14:24.798 --> 01:14:26.424
I forgot...

1877
01:14:26.466 --> 01:14:28.134
what makes me happy...

1878
01:14:29.386 --> 01:14:31.096
...what lights me up...

1879
01:14:32.389 --> 01:14:35.600
...what God has
blessed me to do...

1880
01:14:35.642 --> 01:14:38.436
[voice breaking] ...and
our daughter is seeing that.

1881
01:14:38.478 --> 01:14:40.438
She's also seeing
that her mother's

1882
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.649
incredibly generous
with her time

1883
01:14:42.691 --> 01:14:43.817
and devoted to her family.

1884
01:14:43.858 --> 01:14:45.610
She's also seeing

1885
01:14:45.652 --> 01:14:47.779
that her mother
is not devoted to herself.

1886
01:14:47.821 --> 01:14:50.615
I've been teaching her
an either/or life...

1887
01:14:50.657 --> 01:14:54.619
to have one
is not to have the other.

1888
01:14:54.661 --> 01:14:56.538
I want both. Mark.

1889
01:14:57.664 --> 01:15:01.292
I've been to every recital.
every show...

1890
01:15:01.334 --> 01:15:02.293
[breath shaking]

1891
01:15:02.335 --> 01:15:04.337
...but this time.

1892
01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:06.631
I gotta show up for me.

1893
01:15:07.674 --> 01:15:09.134
I want to be proud of me.

1894
01:15:09.175 --> 01:15:10.260
[he chuckles]

1895
01:15:11.761 --> 01:15:13.304
[kissing]

1896
01:15:13.346 --> 01:15:15.181
[***]

1897
01:15:20.228 --> 01:15:22.480
There's that peach cobbler.

1898
01:15:22.522 --> 01:15:23.606
[chuckling]

1899
01:15:24.774 --> 01:15:26.943
[RJ] You've come a long way.

1900
01:15:26.985 --> 01:15:28.278
I'm proud of you.

1901
01:15:28.319 --> 01:15:29.821
So proud. in fact.

1902
01:15:29.863 --> 01:15:32.157
I invited an old friend
to the show tonight.

1903
01:15:32.198 --> 01:15:33.742
He's casting a new show

1904
01:15:33.783 --> 01:15:36.077
and saw you on that ghastly
Take Twowrap-up show.

1905
01:15:36.119 --> 01:15:37.203
but then he called me.

1906
01:15:37.245 --> 01:15:38.371
Maybe something good

1907
01:15:38.413 --> 01:15:40.123
can come
from that tabloid mess.

1908
01:15:40.165 --> 01:15:42.542
[call ringing]

1909
01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:47.589
[phone ringing]

1910
01:15:50.925 --> 01:15:52.010
Mm-hmm?

1911
01:15:52.052 --> 01:15:53.303
RJ?

1912
01:15:53.345 --> 01:15:54.971
I need you
to get Claire to the show.

1913
01:15:55.013 --> 01:15:56.389
[RJ] A million steps
ahead of you there.

1914
01:15:56.431 --> 01:15:57.515
She's already here.

1915
01:15:57.557 --> 01:15:58.767
Is that him?

1916
01:15:58.808 --> 01:16:00.643
Mm-hmm.

1917
01:16:01.936 --> 01:16:04.356
The show is gonna
start soon... Bruce.

1918
01:16:04.397 --> 01:16:06.691
I'd hate to disappoint her
by telling her you're coming

1919
01:16:06.733 --> 01:16:08.360
unless you're sure.

1920
01:16:08.401 --> 01:16:09.444
She's been
disappointed enough.

1921
01:16:09.486 --> 01:16:10.987
I know.

1922
01:16:11.029 --> 01:16:13.031
Well. you've got 20 minutes
till Claire's call.

1923
01:16:13.073 --> 01:16:14.366
Okay?

1924
01:16:14.407 --> 01:16:17.077
I certainly hope
you don't miss her. Bruce.

1925
01:16:18.453 --> 01:16:21.164
Hurry up. sir. Please?

1926
01:16:21.206 --> 01:16:23.958
[***]

1927
01:16:27.128 --> 01:16:28.963
Come on. Dani.

1928
01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:35.345
[tires screeching]

1929
01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:37.222
[door opening]

1930
01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:39.933
[door closing]

1931
01:16:39.974 --> 01:16:42.060
Keep the change.
Thank you.

1932
01:16:46.648 --> 01:16:49.234
[exhaling]

1933
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.991
Hey. PTA.

1934
01:17:00.662 --> 01:17:03.123
[exhaling]

1935
01:17:03.164 --> 01:17:06.376
I'm sorry. Claire.

1936
01:17:06.418 --> 01:17:08.128
I shouldn't have
given up on you.

1937
01:17:09.421 --> 01:17:11.381
You wouldn't be the first.

1938
01:17:12.799 --> 01:17:14.718
You can trust people
to be there for you.

1939
01:17:14.759 --> 01:17:17.137
to help you.

1940
01:17:17.178 --> 01:17:18.722
We're moms. right?

1941
01:17:18.763 --> 01:17:20.473
What did you say?

1942
01:17:20.515 --> 01:17:22.434
"We arethe help."

1943
01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.814
You've had one foot out
since we started this thing.

1944
01:17:27.856 --> 01:17:30.525
You're right.

1945
01:17:30.567 --> 01:17:32.902
I have.

1946
01:17:32.944 --> 01:17:34.863
But this partnership
we found.

1947
01:17:34.904 --> 01:17:37.407
I don't know how.

1948
01:17:37.449 --> 01:17:39.701
but through all the chaos.

1949
01:17:39.743 --> 01:17:41.911
we managed to create
something special.

1950
01:17:43.246 --> 01:17:44.748
And I promise.

1951
01:17:44.789 --> 01:17:48.001
I'm not ready
to give up on that.

1952
01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:51.880
I'm not ready
to give up on me.

1953
01:17:51.921 --> 01:17:55.300
And you...
you help me to see that.

1954
01:17:55.342 --> 01:17:58.928
I was just scared
to want all of this again.

1955
01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:01.181
You think I'm not scared?

1956
01:18:01.222 --> 01:18:03.641
I'm terrified.

1957
01:18:03.683 --> 01:18:06.144
So...

1958
01:18:06.186 --> 01:18:07.896
are we ready to do this thing?

1959
01:18:08.897 --> 01:18:10.607
[both chuckling]

1960
01:18:10.648 --> 01:18:12.067
[Brian] Dream Mom.
Dream Mom. Dream Mom.

1961
01:18:12.108 --> 01:18:13.109
Dream Mom.

1962
01:18:13.151 --> 01:18:14.652
Hi.

1963
01:18:14.694 --> 01:18:16.279
Hi. It's "Dream Moms."

1964
01:18:16.321 --> 01:18:18.114
Dream Moms. right. Sorry.

1965
01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:19.616
Okay.

1966
01:18:19.657 --> 01:18:21.493
We're ready for you.

1967
01:18:21.534 --> 01:18:23.286
You look great.
by the way.

1968
01:18:23.328 --> 01:18:25.205
Come on.

1969
01:18:26.706 --> 01:18:31.461
[applause]

1970
01:18:31.503 --> 01:18:33.421

And we're back

for the moment
we've all been waiting for...

2007
01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.713
to see who will be
the Next America's Superstar.

2008
01:20:38.755 --> 01:20:39.798
Will it be

[director]
And we're out.

2023
01:21:04.406 --> 01:21:06.866
Hey. we got to perform
on Broadway.

2024
01:21:06.908 --> 01:21:08.284
Well...

2025
01:21:08.326 --> 01:21:10.161
the theater's
on Broadway.

2026
01:21:10.203 --> 01:21:11.204
We're not on Broadway.

2027
01:21:11.246 --> 01:21:13.581
There's always next season.

2028
01:21:13.623 --> 01:21:15.458
[footsteps approaching]

2029
01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.794
Mom. you were so robbed!

-[gasping]
-Hey!

2031
01:21:19.462 --> 01:21:20.463
Ohh.

2032
01:21:20.505 --> 01:21:23.008
Aunt Viv ain't got
nothing on you.

2033
01:21:23.049 --> 01:21:24.426
I can't believe
you made it!

2034
01:21:24.467 --> 01:21:25.719
Oh!

2035
01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:26.720
Wait.

2036
01:21:26.761 --> 01:21:28.847
Boris?

2037
01:21:28.888 --> 01:21:30.807
I am so proud of you.

2038
01:21:30.849 --> 01:21:31.725
Thanks. Mom.

2039
01:21:31.766 --> 01:21:33.268
Oh. my goodness.

[laughing]

2041
01:21:34.644 --> 01:21:37.564
And we are proud of you.

2042
01:21:37.605 --> 01:21:39.983
What did Jameson say
about me not being there?

2043
01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:41.609
Ah. he said it was odd.

2044
01:21:41.651 --> 01:21:42.902
I'm sorry. Mark.

2045
01:21:42.944 --> 01:21:44.320
He said it was odd

2046
01:21:44.362 --> 01:21:46.531
that a mother wouldn't choose
to support her family.

2047
01:21:46.573 --> 01:21:48.742
and I said

2048
01:21:48.783 --> 01:21:51.244
it's odd that a family wouldn't
choose to support the mother.

2049
01:21:53.705 --> 01:21:55.165
Mm. Come here.

2050
01:21:55.206 --> 01:21:57.083
And this is for you. Mom.

2051
01:21:57.125 --> 01:22:00.003
[sighing] I promise.
I wasn't snooping.

2052
01:22:00.045 --> 01:22:01.629
Mom. I know
you weren't snooping.

2053
01:22:01.671 --> 01:22:04.632
If you were snooping...
you would have seen this.

2054
01:22:09.846 --> 01:22:11.348
[gasping]

2055
01:22:11.389 --> 01:22:12.807
"After careful consideration.

2056
01:22:12.849 --> 01:22:15.226
the Scholarship Committee
of the Wallford School is..."

2057
01:22:15.268 --> 01:22:16.811
[voice breaking]
"...happy to extend..."

2058
01:22:16.853 --> 01:22:18.605

2060
01:22:21.191 --> 01:22:23.401
Oh. I'm so proud of you!

2061
01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.491
That was amazing.

2062
01:22:29.532 --> 01:22:32.494
although it feels like
there's something missing.

2063
01:22:32.535 --> 01:22:33.745
If I recall.

2064
01:22:33.787 --> 01:22:37.082
you said something
about a "to be continued."

2065
01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:40.460
[chuckling]

2066
01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.713
Well. okay. PTA!

2067

Mm-hmm!

[Mark and Dani chuckling]

2069
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:50.470
Ladies?

2070
01:22:50.512 --> 01:22:51.680
This is Bruce.

2071
01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:52.889
Wait.

2072
01:22:52.931 --> 01:22:55.266
"Bruce" is Bruce Tallin?

2073
01:22:55.308 --> 01:22:57.519
TheBruce Tallin?

2074
01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.645
[Bruce chuckling]

2075
01:22:58.687 --> 01:23:00.021
It's great to meet you too.

2076
01:23:00.063 --> 01:23:01.690
I was so stoked to realize

2077
01:23:01.731 --> 01:23:04.859
my buddy RJ was working
with such a unique act.

2078
01:23:04.901 --> 01:23:06.653
You two would make

2079
01:23:06.695 --> 01:23:08.613
such a great addition
to my new Broadway show.

2080
01:23:08.655 --> 01:23:11.074
And. RJ.
we've got to talk

2081
01:23:11.116 --> 01:23:12.659
about you choreographing
for me again.

2082
01:23:12.701 --> 01:23:13.993
[both gasping]

2083
01:23:14.035 --> 01:23:14.786
You did a great job
with these two.

2084
01:23:14.828 --> 01:23:15.787
[Claire] What?

2085
01:23:15.829 --> 01:23:18.039
Well. I won't argue with facts.

2086
01:23:18.081 --> 01:23:19.874

[all talking at once]

2089
01:23:23.128 --> 01:23:24.963
Perfect timing!

2090
01:23:25.005 --> 01:23:26.631
-Okay!
-Here we go.

2091
01:23:26.673 --> 01:23:28.591
Well... here.

2092
01:23:28.633 --> 01:23:29.759
To the Dream Moms.

2093
01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:31.136
To Broadway.

2094
01:23:31.177 --> 01:23:32.178
To family.

2095
01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:34.180
To a unique act.

2096
01:23:34.222 --> 01:23:37.392
Guess it's not
so overrated after all.
