3
00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:17.990
You often hear people say
things like. "Life is strange."

4
00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:22.038
But I don't think
it's quite as strange
as people think it is.

5
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:26.651
because coincidences
are not as prevalent
as we are led to believe.

6
00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:30.742
Now. our time on this planet
is far more rooted

7
00:01:30.786 --> 00:01:33.484
in cause and effect
than any of us believe.

8
00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:35.791
And the ancient civilizations
knew it.

9
00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:38.968
conscious of
an interconnectedness
that binds us.

10
00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:44.452
But if we are connected.
why are we so far apart?

11
00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:47.368
Cause and effect?
Ones and zeroes?

12
00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:50.806
But what are
the ones and zeroes?
Just an invention?

13
00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.985
A means of distinguishing
between a single something
and multiple somethings?

14
00:01:56.028 --> 00:01:59.249
Someone had to invent numbers
to make sense of it.

15
00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:01.208
What if those
ancient philosophers.

16
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:03.340
visionaries.
mathematicians. astronomers

17
00:02:03.384 --> 00:02:06.126
knew things
most of us don't know?

18
00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:09.825
And those things
are kept secret from us?

19
00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:12.697
What if we only sense
that we are bound together

20
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:14.917
in this experiment
called humanity.

21
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.180
but the real connection
is not there?

22
00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:19.443
What if there is
a grid of energy

23
00:02:19.487 --> 00:02:22.403
that stretches
from pole to pole?

24
00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:25.797
I've discovered that this
is the singular truth

25
00:02:25.841 --> 00:02:29.932
if not of this universe
then certainly of this world.

26
00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:33.544
The course I took
to figure it out
was an arduous one.

27
00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:36.721
and the twists and turns
while in the midst of them.

28
00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:40.725
seem to be.
as they say. strange.

29
00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.207
But such is life.

30
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.213
Despite nearly three decades
as a public figure
of some renown.

31
00:02:50.257 --> 00:02:53.260
Finley Hart
remains somewhat of an enigma.

32
00:02:53.303 --> 00:02:55.914
Hart Enterprises
was at the forefront
of technological advances

33
00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.221
such as microprocessors.
personal computers.

34
00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:00.267
and the creation
of the internet.

35
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.530
and in the 1980s.
moved their headquarters

36
00:03:02.573 --> 00:03:04.488
to a sprawling new campus
in Northern California.

37
00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:07.056
Finley Hart always considered
Hart a family business.

38
00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.798
and hired his sister Rebecca
to head up
the analytics department.

39
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:14.106
In 1983.
Rebecca would introduce Finley
to Samantha Hart.

40
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.283
a systems engineer
who would later marry...

41
00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:19.634
As former employees alleged.
he has a mercurial personality.

42
00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:22.506
Hakan Nordquist.
the Chairman of the Board
for Hart Enterprises.

43
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.380
and close friend
of its founder.
dismisses such allegations.

44
00:03:26.423 --> 00:03:27.511
That's bullshit.

45
00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:29.339
What can I say?

46
00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:32.516
Okay. is Finley driven?
Absolutely.

47
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.912
He's driven to innovate.
to move forward.
to excel. to achieve.

48
00:03:36.955 --> 00:03:39.306
Is he tough to work for?
Absolutely.

49
00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.091
But what boss isn't?
Thank you very much.

50
00:03:42.134 --> 00:03:46.008
...after renowned software
developer Samantha Hart
has passed away...

51
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:47.749
Mrs. Hart had suffered
a troubled pregnancy

52
00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:50.273
and her son was born
six weeks premature.

53
00:03:50.317 --> 00:03:52.057
Though now is in
stable condition.

54
00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:53.842
The industry has been
rocked by news

55
00:03:53.885 --> 00:03:55.887
that Finley Hart
of Hart Enterprises

56
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:58.107
has been ousted
from the technology firm

57
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.283
he founded 34 years ago
in Seattle.

58
00:04:00.327 --> 00:04:01.980
The Hart Enterprise's
board of directors

59
00:04:02.024 --> 00:04:03.808
was reportedly
blindsided by news

60
00:04:03.852 --> 00:04:06.158
that Mr. Hart
had diverted company funds

61
00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:07.812
to finance a secretive project

62
00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:09.727
called the
Quantinuum Initiative.

63
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:11.294
Details are sketchy
on just what

64
00:04:11.338 --> 00:04:13.253
the Quantinuum
Initiative entailed.

65
00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:15.255
Continued allegations
from a former developer

66
00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:17.692
for Hart Enterprises
who claims some familiarity

67
00:04:17.735 --> 00:04:19.650
with the Quantinuum Initiative.

68
00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:21.217
Every app he created
or financed

69
00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.827
was designed
to collect user data.

70
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.308
The more. um. popular apps

71
00:04:25.352 --> 00:04:27.397
allowed Finley through
the Quantinuum Initiative

72
00:04:27.441 --> 00:04:29.704
to seize control
of user cameras.

73
00:04:29.747 --> 00:04:32.228
Ex-billionaire Finley Hart
has reportedly passed away

74
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.099
due to complications
from kidney failure.

75
00:04:34.143 --> 00:04:36.319
...wife died
while giving birth in 1992.

76
00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:38.452
he's survived by
his sister Rebecca

77
00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:40.323
and his son. Samuel Hart.

78
00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:42.238
Again. our top story tonight.

79
00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.806
Finley Hart
is watching us no more.

80
00:06:48.103 --> 00:06:51.498
Mom. get up.

81
00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.459
Mom. get up.

82
00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:01.943
Get up.

83
00:07:03.553 --> 00:07:05.337
Are you just now getting home?

84
00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:06.991
Yes.
You can yell at me later. okay?

85
00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:08.689
- You have a call. remember?
- What?

86
00:07:08.732 --> 00:07:10.734
- Here.
- Shit.

87
00:07:24.705 --> 00:07:26.054
Oh...

88
00:07:40.503 --> 00:07:42.810
Jeez. Phil. one minute
you're swinging your dick

89
00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:45.334
talking about what kind
of a big shot you are.

90
00:07:45.377 --> 00:07:47.205
next minute
you're crying poverty.

91
00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:49.033
I don't think
you understand me. Trevor.

92
00:07:49.077 --> 00:07:50.513
My needs changed.

93
00:07:50.557 --> 00:07:51.949
And if you can't keep up.

94
00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:53.385
I will not pay the balance
of your fee.

95
00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:56.171
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
Slow down there. cowboy.

96
00:07:56.214 --> 00:08:00.958
Breathe. breathe. Okay.
You listening?

97
00:08:02.307 --> 00:08:04.745
- Yeah. I'm listening.
- Good.

98
00:08:04.788 --> 00:08:07.051
Now. we had an agreement.

99
00:08:07.095 --> 00:08:08.966
and in that agreement
was a deadline.

100
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.925
Now you asked me
to do you a favor.

101
00:08:10.968 --> 00:08:13.884
- Look. I don't need a recap.
- Well. you're getting one.

102
00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:17.627
Now. in that favor. you asked us
to move the deadline.

103
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:20.543
Now. I'll meet that deadline.

104
00:08:20.587 --> 00:08:24.808
If you got some personal issues
that left you cash-strapped.
look. I feel for you. bro.

105
00:08:24.852 --> 00:08:29.421
but if you think that you can
demand that I finish tonight.

106
00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:31.423
and threaten
to withhold my funds

107
00:08:31.467 --> 00:08:34.165
because you think
I'm some kind of nerd

108
00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:36.080
that you hired off
of monster.com.

109
00:08:36.124 --> 00:08:38.430
you got another thing coming.
my friend.

110
00:08:38.474 --> 00:08:41.303
I can't move the deadline.
Again.

111
00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:43.000
And may I ask why?

112
00:08:46.613 --> 00:08:49.877
Yes. you may. Phil.
because it's date night.

113
00:09:04.326 --> 00:09:05.893
- Good morning. Ms. Schultz!
- Morning.

114
00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:08.373
- How are you today?
- Next time you schedule

115
00:09:08.417 --> 00:09:11.420
a conference call
at the crack of dawn for me

116
00:09:11.463 --> 00:09:13.074
my hourly rate will double.

117
00:09:13.117 --> 00:09:15.772
Haven't you heard?
In early risings.

118
00:09:15.816 --> 00:09:17.687
there are blessings
and success?

119
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:20.821
I need to make one thing
clear and understood

120
00:09:20.864 --> 00:09:23.127
before the others hop on.

121
00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:25.652
I work for you.

122
00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:28.132
I want the deal
that works for you.

123
00:09:28.176 --> 00:09:30.700
- Certainly.
- However. I will not be

124
00:09:30.744 --> 00:09:32.789
- dragged into any kind of--
- I would not drag you

125
00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:36.140
into anything that you
did not feel comfortable.

126
00:09:36.184 --> 00:09:38.795
Let me finish.
On the call yesterday.

127
00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:42.320
you second-guessed me
and it makes us both look bad.

128
00:09:43.278 --> 00:09:44.584
I am the attorney.

129
00:09:44.627 --> 00:09:46.194
If I make a suggestion

130
00:09:46.237 --> 00:09:49.023
it's with
your best interest in mind.

131
00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:52.592
I understand.
I regret that I let my temper
get the better of me.

132
00:09:52.635 --> 00:09:55.029
- Good.
- You have my assurances
this will not happen again.

133
00:09:55.072 --> 00:09:57.945
So say it.
I need you to say it.

134
00:09:57.988 --> 00:10:01.862
Say. "Veronica.
you're the attorney. I'm not."

135
00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:05.039
Veronica. you are the attorney.
I am not.

136
00:10:06.344 --> 00:10:07.563
Thank you.

137
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.826
- Was that so difficult?

138
00:10:40.901 --> 00:10:42.816
Uh. Schultz. are you with us?

139
00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:44.731
I never agreed to that.
and I never will!

140
00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:46.820
Can you get your client
to stop yelling?

141
00:10:46.863 --> 00:10:48.386
- I'm not yelling.
- Ms. Schultz?

142
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.562
Look. I'm a nice guy.
I'm not trying to--

143
00:10:50.606 --> 00:10:51.912
Gentlemen. stop. I'm sorry.

144
00:10:51.955 --> 00:10:53.478
We'll have to
pick this up later.

145
00:10:53.522 --> 00:10:56.264
I have to deal with a matter
of urgent concern.

146
00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:10.800
Yeah?

147
00:11:16.284 --> 00:11:17.502
Who is it?

148
00:11:47.794 --> 00:11:50.231
♪♪

149
00:13:05.567 --> 00:13:07.351
Urgent enough
to skip out on this?

150
00:13:07.395 --> 00:13:08.613
Apparently so.

151
00:13:08.657 --> 00:13:10.267
Look. just hang out there.

152
00:13:10.311 --> 00:13:11.921
it shouldn't take long.

153
00:13:11.965 --> 00:13:16.186
Oh. baby.
You're not even looking at me.

154
00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:20.756
- Oh.

155
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.280
Taylor... it's about Finley.

156
00:13:24.412 --> 00:13:25.587
Finley?

157
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.851
Oh. okay.

158
00:13:28.895 --> 00:13:32.028
Well. I'll be waiting for you.

159
00:13:33.116 --> 00:13:34.770
I can't wait to see you.

160
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:37.512
I can't wait to see you. too.

161
00:13:47.652 --> 00:13:50.220
Hey. babe. How you doing?

162
00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:53.049
Good. I just got here and my mom
is already driving me nuts.

163
00:13:53.093 --> 00:13:55.312
- How's my boy?

164
00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:58.141
Oh. you know what?
I'm doing good. I'm doing good.

165
00:13:58.185 --> 00:14:00.274
- I meant our son.
- I know.

166
00:14:00.317 --> 00:14:02.145
He's-- he's doing really good.

167
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:05.496
Uh. hey. though.
where did you get that picture

168
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.847
of me and Finley
and Aunt Rebecca.

169
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.674
the one that's hanging
in the nursery?

170
00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:11.502
I didn't even know you had
a picture of you and your dad.

171
00:14:11.546 --> 00:14:14.810
Somebody put it up. babe.
It wasn't me.

172
00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:16.899
It wasn't me. either.

173
00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:19.423
You said you wanted
to see him again. so I--

174
00:14:19.467 --> 00:14:22.557
- Yeah. so I could tell him
what a shit dad he was.

175
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.559
Oh. I thought he was
down for the night.

176
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.388
Take me there.
I wanna see him.

177
00:14:28.563 --> 00:14:29.651
Okay.

178
00:14:52.848 --> 00:14:55.764
Please complete the two-factor
authorization steps

179
00:14:55.807 --> 00:14:57.548
on the authenticator app.

180
00:14:57.592 --> 00:14:59.855
If you do not have
the authenticator--

181
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.031
Thank you. Mr. Matsuda.

182
00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:23.270
He's sleeping peacefully.
Uh. for now.

183
00:15:23.313 --> 00:15:26.099
Oh. and here's
the photo of Finley
I was telling you about.

184
00:15:26.142 --> 00:15:28.014
Okay. babe. I got to go.
Love you.

185
00:15:28.057 --> 00:15:29.232
I love you. too. babe.

186
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:34.977
Well. uh.
science is not creative. is it?

187
00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:38.981
It's. uh. rigid fact-based.

188
00:15:39.025 --> 00:15:41.984
uh. but art. by its very nature.
is. uh. creatively-based.

189
00:15:42.028 --> 00:15:44.421
And. uh.
what is creativity?

190
00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:47.598
Well. oftentimes. creativity
is about connection. is it not?

191
00:15:47.642 --> 00:15:51.776
I mean. take for instance this.
uh. ubiquitous thing.

192
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.650
Uh. the first cell phone
simply connected two.

193
00:15:55.693 --> 00:16:01.743
uh. specific ideas. uh.
or the existing ideas.
the phone and radio waves.

194
00:16:01.786 --> 00:16:05.355
And later. the internet
and the cell phones

195
00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.531
led to the creation
of the smart phone.

196
00:16:07.575 --> 00:16:10.795
And. uh. the functioning
of these devices

197
00:16:10.839 --> 00:16:14.016
is based solely on
the aforementioned
science of radio waves.

198
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.540
you know.
information technology.
et cetera. et cetera. et cetera.

199
00:16:16.584 --> 00:16:21.632
But it took creative minds to.
uh. connect these scientific
principles in a-- a.

200
00:16:21.676 --> 00:16:27.595
you know. practical.
um. user-friendly. uh...

Proxy for Finley Hart.

221
00:18:03.647 --> 00:18:06.172
Hey. man.
it's been a minute. huh?
How you been?

222
00:18:06.215 --> 00:18:07.260
I'm sorry.
Do we know each other?

223
00:18:07.303 --> 00:18:09.000
Yeah. we met at the visitation

224
00:18:09.044 --> 00:18:11.612
after. well. you know--

225
00:18:11.655 --> 00:18:13.918
Sorry about your dad.
Must have been tough.

226
00:18:13.962 --> 00:18:15.572
Thanks. But can we proceed?

227
00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:17.531
Yeah. sure.

228
00:18:17.574 --> 00:18:19.402
Thank you.
Prior to his death.

229
00:18:19.446 --> 00:18:21.187
Mr. Finley Hart
chose each of you

230
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.189
to be a part
of the reactivation plan.

231
00:18:23.232 --> 00:18:26.583
You're talking about
that machine. aren't you?

232
00:18:26.627 --> 00:18:31.284
Yes. Step one of
the reactivation protocol
has been completed.

233
00:18:31.327 --> 00:18:36.115
What? Who--
who reactivated it?

234
00:18:36.158 --> 00:18:38.291
The purpose of this call
is not to ascertain

235
00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:40.858
who took the initial step
towards reactivation.

236
00:18:40.902 --> 00:18:42.773
but to complete
the reactivation

237
00:18:42.817 --> 00:18:45.994
and therefore allow the machine
to become fully functional.

238
00:18:46.037 --> 00:18:48.214
What is
the Quantinuum Initiative?

239
00:18:48.257 --> 00:18:49.911
It doesn't matter what it is.

240
00:18:49.954 --> 00:18:51.565
We were given
explicit information

241
00:18:51.608 --> 00:18:53.132
and instruction what we should--

242
00:18:53.175 --> 00:18:55.873
- No-- It matters to me.
- Why?

243
00:18:55.917 --> 00:18:58.659
Maybe I met you at the funeral
or the visitation. okay?

244
00:18:58.702 --> 00:19:00.139
Maybe I met all of you.

245
00:19:00.182 --> 00:19:01.705
But I don't know any of you

246
00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:03.403
and I certainly
didn't know Finley.

247
00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:05.622
All I know is he lost control
of Hart Enterprises.

248
00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:08.451
So. you'll excuse me
if I wanna know

249
00:19:08.495 --> 00:19:10.932
a little bit more of why
the hell we're all here.

250
00:19:10.975 --> 00:19:12.890
I mean. you clearly
all know each other.

251
00:19:12.934 --> 00:19:14.936
I don't know any of these people
except the counselor.

252
00:19:14.979 --> 00:19:17.547
Okay. we all worked for your
father in various capacities

253
00:19:17.591 --> 00:19:20.028
over a span of maybe 20 years.

254
00:19:20.071 --> 00:19:22.248
Our paths may
have crossed but no.

255
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:24.075
we are not well acquainted.

256
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:25.555
Yeah. were you
a part of his ouster?

257
00:19:25.599 --> 00:19:26.991
Were any of you?

258
00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:29.733
I voted in favor
of keeping him.

259
00:19:29.777 --> 00:19:32.649
And then I was let go.

260
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.349
- He was a good man.
- If you say so.

261
00:19:36.392 --> 00:19:40.353
So. what the hell
is the Quantinuum Project?

262
00:19:40.396 --> 00:19:42.485
It's fringe science. Sam.

263
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:44.966
Alien contact. micro-technology.

264
00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:46.837
artificial intelligence.
alien technology.

265
00:19:46.881 --> 00:19:48.883
As I understand.
the biggest breakthroughs

266
00:19:48.926 --> 00:19:51.320
were in displacement technology.

267
00:19:51.364 --> 00:19:54.758
You mean like moving objects?
Like teleportation?

268
00:19:54.802 --> 00:19:58.458
Exactly. Teleportation.
moving objects. people.

269
00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:01.200
And. well. while Ms. Schultz
is correct to say

270
00:20:01.243 --> 00:20:04.638
that the Quantinuum Initiative
saw the biggest breakthrough

271
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:06.814
in the field
of displacement technology.

272
00:20:06.857 --> 00:20:10.252
it was also where we experienced
our biggest controversies.

273
00:20:10.296 --> 00:20:14.909
The central aspect
of the project was the machine.

274
00:20:14.952 --> 00:20:18.086
a device your father
developed in secret.

275
00:20:19.827 --> 00:20:22.395
Which theoretically would power
the technology we created.

276
00:20:22.438 --> 00:20:24.135
Looks like somebody
didn't know pops

277
00:20:24.179 --> 00:20:26.703
was into some weird shit. huh?

278
00:20:26.747 --> 00:20:29.967
We need to get on with this.
Our instructions from Finley
were clear and--

279
00:20:30.011 --> 00:20:31.404
We're missing someone.

280
00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:36.278
Hakan. are you still with us?

281
00:20:39.716 --> 00:20:42.415
Some lunatic is staring
right into my window.

282
00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:45.026
Is it a chick pissed off
at you or a guy?

283
00:20:45.069 --> 00:20:47.724
- Mr. Williams--
- Hey. I'm not judging.

284
00:20:47.768 --> 00:20:49.117
Do you know him?

285
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.947
I don't know.

286
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.470
There's something strange
with his face.

287
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.127
He's. uh. dizzy.

288
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.302
Did you say dizzy?

289
00:21:00.346 --> 00:21:03.740
Yeah. he's like. um. drunk.

getting jumpy.

I'm sorry. I'm back.

293
00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:27.198
Can we go on with this now?

294
00:21:27.242 --> 00:21:28.722
I have a tight schedule today.

295
00:21:28.765 --> 00:21:31.246
Oh. yeah. me. too.
But what you doing?

296
00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.640
Well. that's none
of your business.

297

Host. can you please guide us
through the procedure?

298
00:21:36.077 --> 00:21:38.906
My pleasure.
Each of you should have
received a password.

to keep this password safe.

00:23:58.698 --> 00:24:00.874
He talked about it for years.

346
00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:02.310
I met him in grad school.

347
00:24:02.353 --> 00:24:04.355
He was giving a lecture at MIT.

348
00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:07.663
Said he came up with it
when his wife passed away.

349
00:24:07.707 --> 00:24:11.580
- So '92?

350
00:24:11.624 --> 00:24:15.541
Yeah. I mean. he went all
over the world to find funding.

351
00:24:15.584 --> 00:24:19.153
But he made it official
when he finished the lab
in 2008.

352
00:24:19.196 --> 00:24:22.156
No. no. no. 2009. Yeah.

353
00:24:22.199 --> 00:24:26.595
- Um. did you read this letter?
- We all read it.

354
00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:29.424
And it doesn't scare
the shit out of any of you?

355
00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:31.470
You don't trust
your father. do you?

356
00:24:31.513 --> 00:24:33.297
I don't have a father.

357
00:24:33.341 --> 00:24:35.691
Finley's. um.
he's a guy to me.

358
00:24:35.735 --> 00:24:37.954
Ah... You're a lot like him.

359
00:24:37.998 --> 00:24:40.740
I'm surprised his crazy ass
found five people he trusted.

360
00:24:40.783 --> 00:24:44.613
Well. I knew him well.
and I trust him implicitly.

361
00:24:46.006 --> 00:24:48.051
And don't call him crazy.

362
00:24:48.095 --> 00:24:51.402
So. you--
you know him so well.

363
00:24:51.446 --> 00:24:53.840
what's your best theory
on why he made me proxy?

364
00:24:53.883 --> 00:24:57.583
Mr. Hart.
I know that your father
died with deep regret

365
00:24:57.626 --> 00:25:01.412
that he didn't make
more of an effort to develop
a relationship with you.

366
00:25:01.456 --> 00:25:03.371
Yeah. I bet he did.

367
00:25:06.374 --> 00:25:09.072
Hey. just for the record.
I meant a good crazy. like.

368
00:25:09.116 --> 00:25:11.205
- Finley. you crazy bastard.
- Sorry. I'm back.

369
00:25:11.248 --> 00:25:12.815
- Oh. great.
- Yeah. let's just
get on with this.

370
00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:14.513
I couldn't agree more.

371
00:25:14.556 --> 00:25:16.602
Host. can you please remind us
of the procedure?

372
00:25:16.645 --> 00:25:18.125
It would be my pleasure.

373
00:25:18.168 --> 00:25:20.214
Has everyone found
their secure password?

374
00:25:21.824 --> 00:25:23.739
- Yes.
- Excellent.

375
00:25:23.783 --> 00:25:25.828
At the bottom of the letter.
you will find the address

376
00:25:25.872 --> 00:25:27.569
to a secure FTP site.

377
00:25:27.613 --> 00:25:29.658
Please take a moment to log on.

378
00:25:42.715 --> 00:25:45.805
♪ If you like piña coladas

379
00:25:45.848 --> 00:25:46.936
No. Just no.

380
00:26:10.917 --> 00:26:13.397
Geez. Hakan. take your time.
why don't you. huh?

381
00:26:13.441 --> 00:26:14.529
Shut up.

382
00:26:16.357 --> 00:26:19.490
- It's-- it's case sensitive.
- Shut up.

383
00:26:21.623 --> 00:26:23.016
- I'm in.

384
00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:24.539
Excellent.

385
00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:27.542
You now have
60 minutes to input.

386
00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:28.717
Where-- where is he going?

387
00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:29.849
I'm just getting my water

388
00:26:29.892 --> 00:26:30.980
if that's okay with you.

389
00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:41.338
He's back.

390
00:26:55.309 --> 00:26:57.137
Ooh. gross.

391
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.312
What did he say?

392
00:27:00.009 --> 00:27:01.620
He said that
asshole puked in the street.

393
00:27:01.663 --> 00:27:03.491
That's exactly what I said.

394
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.495
What? I did a gap year
in Sweden.

395
00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:11.673
What's he doing?

396
00:27:11.717 --> 00:27:13.109
Wait.

397
00:27:15.938 --> 00:27:17.070
Hakan?

398
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.904
He's gone.

399
00:27:24.947 --> 00:27:26.688
- What do you mean gone?

400
00:27:28.255 --> 00:27:30.431
Hakan! Hakan?

401
00:28:36.453 --> 00:28:38.151
Dude's been gone
for five minutes.

402
00:28:38.194 --> 00:28:40.153
Maybe he's getting
second thoughts.

403
00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:42.242
Why would he
be having second thoughts?

404
00:28:42.285 --> 00:28:43.547
- Shut up. Mr. Williams.
- No. answer my question.

405
00:28:43.591 --> 00:28:46.159
He wouldn't be
getting second thoughts.

406
00:28:46.202 --> 00:28:48.857
Mr. Hart. you'll have to
forgive Mr. Williams.

407
00:28:48.901 --> 00:28:50.511
During his time
with Hart Enterprises.

408
00:28:50.554 --> 00:28:52.034
Mr. Williams thought it wise

409
00:28:52.078 --> 00:28:53.644
to supplement his income

410
00:28:53.688 --> 00:28:55.690
as a sort of hacker for hire.

411
00:28:55.734 --> 00:28:57.518
False. I never
thought it was wise.

412
00:28:57.561 --> 00:28:59.389
In any event.
his actions created significant

413
00:28:59.433 --> 00:29:01.870
liability issues
for Hart Enterprises.

414
00:29:01.914 --> 00:29:05.352
and I was surprised your father
invited him back a year later.

415
00:29:05.395 --> 00:29:08.007
Yeah. Invited me back.
and trusted me with this.

416
00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:09.269
Does that surprise you. too?

417
00:29:09.312 --> 00:29:10.836
Surprise isn't
strong enough a word.

418
00:29:10.879 --> 00:29:12.402
Jesus. I get it.

419
00:29:12.446 --> 00:29:14.970
Why would Hakan
be having second thoughts?

420
00:29:15.014 --> 00:29:16.406
He wouldn't.

421
00:29:19.192 --> 00:29:22.412
You're insinuating
or suggesting that. um...

422
00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:26.242
a person can be. uh.

423
00:29:26.286 --> 00:29:29.158
labeled in many ways.
is that right?

424
00:29:29.202 --> 00:29:32.466
- Correct.
- Is that correct? It is. okay.

425
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:34.816
Wow. Golly gosh.
I'm sorry. old sport.

426
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.601
I had no idea
because. you know.
my ego is far too big.

427
00:29:37.645 --> 00:29:42.215
far too. um. fragile to.
uh. read my paper clippings.

428
00:29:42.258 --> 00:29:44.783
And. um. it's a habit
I kicked 30 years ago.

429
00:29:44.826 --> 00:29:47.524
But what I do know about.
uh. people or persons

430
00:29:47.568 --> 00:29:50.789
is that. uh. whatever they say
about me. is that. um.

431
00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:54.053
it's either. um.
excessive praise.

432
00:29:54.096 --> 00:29:57.143
which borders on sycophancy.
or just. uh.

433
00:29:57.186 --> 00:29:59.972
venomous denunciation
which borders on.

434
00:30:00.015 --> 00:30:02.801
uh. um. slander. you know?

435
00:30:07.588 --> 00:30:10.286
The machine runs on
dark matter reactor.

436
00:30:12.636 --> 00:30:16.989
M-- Meaning that its power
source interacts with gravity?

437
00:30:17.032 --> 00:30:19.861
Yes. fundamentally.
but Finley found a way

438
00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:21.950
to capture it
in a tachyon field.

439
00:30:21.994 --> 00:30:24.605
A tachyon field?
How does it stabilize?

440
00:30:24.648 --> 00:30:26.520
I don't know
what any of that means. but--

441
00:30:26.563 --> 00:30:29.218
The tachyon field
must remain intact

442
00:30:29.262 --> 00:30:33.092
or the anti-matter could expand
starting this-- this-- this
chain reaction.

443
00:30:33.135 --> 00:30:36.269
That could cause a worldwide
electromagnetic event.

444
00:30:36.312 --> 00:30:41.883
Yeah. Which could. in turn.
sheer the-- the electromagnetic
shield around the planet

445
00:30:41.927 --> 00:30:45.017
allowing these massive amounts
of solar and cosmic radiation

446
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.063
to-- to-- to scorch
the surface of the earth.

447
00:30:50.587 --> 00:30:52.676
Oh. is that all?

448
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:55.897
Riku. is that true?

449
00:30:57.725 --> 00:30:59.466
It's true.

450
00:31:01.294 --> 00:31:02.861
That's a possibility. yes.

451
00:31:02.904 --> 00:31:05.037
It was.

452
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.083
It was a source of much debate
within the Initiative.

453
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:12.871
And when the board
discovered that
Finley was doing--

454
00:31:12.914 --> 00:31:14.350
They ousted him.

455
00:31:15.612 --> 00:31:17.527
Yeah.

456
00:31:17.571 --> 00:31:19.747
And all the stuff
that made the news.

457
00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.662
and diversions of funds and--

458
00:31:21.705 --> 00:31:23.272
It was itself a diversion.

459
00:31:25.361 --> 00:31:28.887
You now have
53 minutes to input the--

460
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:30.062
Hey. guys.

461
00:31:30.105 --> 00:31:32.238
we're not alone
on this call.

462
00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:35.632
- What?
- Yup.

463
00:31:35.676 --> 00:31:37.808
Yeah. someone tapped
into the line.

464
00:31:37.852 --> 00:31:39.941
How-- how come
we-- we can't see them?

465
00:31:39.985 --> 00:31:44.598
- It's. uh--
look. I can't explain it.
- Well. give it a go.

466
00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:46.948
Well. can you sum up
contract law in five seconds

467
00:31:46.992 --> 00:31:48.602
in a way I can understand?

468
00:31:48.645 --> 00:31:51.170
You sign a contract.
you abide by it.

469
00:31:53.302 --> 00:31:55.043
Okay. bad example.

470
00:31:55.087 --> 00:31:57.219
Can you tell where they--
they are?

471
00:31:57.263 --> 00:32:01.920
No. No. but whoever it is.
they're really good.

472
00:32:01.963 --> 00:32:03.922
- They're really--

473
00:32:05.271 --> 00:32:07.447
Is that Hakan?

474
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.839
Hakan?

475
00:32:08.883 --> 00:32:10.972
I don't know.

476
00:32:11.016 --> 00:32:14.019
It appears that Mr. Nordquist
has disconnected.

477
00:32:14.062 --> 00:32:16.543
- Please enjoy this music
until he's back online.

478
00:32:16.586 --> 00:32:18.240
Hey. you guys.
that was not Hakan.

479
00:32:18.284 --> 00:32:20.286
- You don't know that!
- Is the song necessary?

480
00:32:20.329 --> 00:32:21.722
- Not at all.

481
00:32:31.514 --> 00:32:34.213
Riku. what--
what are you doing? Riku.

482
00:32:34.256 --> 00:32:35.475
Wait. just give me a minute.

483
00:32:35.518 --> 00:32:37.564
Jesus. this is absurd.

484
00:32:43.222 --> 00:32:45.441
- Hello.
- Hey. Doug. It's me.

485
00:32:45.485 --> 00:32:46.965
Me. who?

486
00:32:47.008 --> 00:32:48.357
Riku Matsuda.

487
00:32:49.358 --> 00:32:51.317
Sorry.

488
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.319
When's the last time
you checked on the equipment?

489
00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:57.845
Riku. the equipment is safe.

490
00:32:57.888 --> 00:33:01.892
It's locked up.
I have eyes on it 24/7

491
00:33:01.936 --> 00:33:03.416
I need you to check it!

492
00:33:03.459 --> 00:33:04.721
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

493
00:33:04.765 --> 00:33:06.419
Who do you
think you're talking to?

494
00:33:06.462 --> 00:33:11.032
Sorry. I'm on a call with
the Quantinuum Contingency team.

495
00:33:11.076 --> 00:33:13.295
Okay. Who are they?

496
00:33:13.339 --> 00:33:16.255
I say the rest of us
input our codes
and be done with it.

497
00:33:16.298 --> 00:33:18.822
- Hey. do we still
have a visitor?
- Yup.

498
00:33:18.866 --> 00:33:20.520
Okay. so.
any luck figuring out

499
00:33:20.563 --> 00:33:22.478
where they are.
who they are?

500
00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.916
Oh. I was supposed to
do that. huh?

501
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.701
- Well--
- Couldn't hurt. could it?

502
00:33:33.533 --> 00:33:35.535
It's coming from
inside the house.

503
00:33:37.928 --> 00:33:40.322
Just kidding.

504
00:33:40.366 --> 00:33:43.543
Can you please
just check the equipment?

505
00:33:48.417 --> 00:33:49.897
Come on.
I'll take you over there.

506
00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.638
Jump onto FaceTime.

507
00:33:51.681 --> 00:33:52.856
Mr. Matsuda.

508
00:33:53.857 --> 00:33:55.381
In a minute.

509
00:33:55.424 --> 00:33:57.557
Well. as you would say nowadays.

510
00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.040
um. it's all truth-adjacent.
shall we say.

511
00:34:02.083 --> 00:34:04.172
or is it adjacent-truth?
I'm not sure.

512
00:34:04.216 --> 00:34:05.695
But it's bit
of a conundrum. isn't it?

513
00:34:05.739 --> 00:34:07.741
The point is
that none of these.

514
00:34:07.784 --> 00:34:09.960
uh. the fealty and obeisance.

515
00:34:10.004 --> 00:34:12.398
uh. thrown my way
has anything to with me.

516
00:34:12.441 --> 00:34:14.356
but with my achievements.

517
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.967
And while there may be. uh.
kernels or seeds of truth

518
00:34:17.011 --> 00:34:20.406
in. um. these. uh. allegations

519
00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:24.062
or these accolades
or castigations.

520
00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:26.716
um. no. I'm-- I'm sorry.

521
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.068
None of these define
exactly who I am.

522
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.725
All right.

523
00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:05.451
No. no. no.

524
00:35:05.494 --> 00:35:06.887
What is it?

525
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.323
Call the Foundation.

526
00:35:09.585 --> 00:35:11.718
- Why?
- It's not here.

527
00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:13.111
Call the Foundation.
right now.

528
00:35:14.024 --> 00:35:15.809
Riku. it's gone.

529
00:35:15.852 --> 00:35:17.332
It's empty. Look. it's empty.

530
00:35:39.224 --> 00:35:42.140
Sorry. Is Hakan back?

531
00:35:42.183 --> 00:35:44.142
- Negative.
- What are you doing?

532
00:35:44.185 --> 00:35:46.448
I'm calling the Foundation.

533
00:35:46.492 --> 00:35:47.841
What's the Foundation?

534
00:35:47.884 --> 00:35:49.364
The Foundation oversees

535
00:35:49.408 --> 00:35:51.975
- remaining corporate interests.
- Shit! No answer.

536
00:35:52.019 --> 00:35:55.979
It's not a place of business.
They don't have working hours.

537
00:35:56.023 --> 00:35:59.244
Well. I thought
it was worth a shot.

538
00:35:59.287 --> 00:36:01.246
And you made a valiant effort.

539
00:36:01.289 --> 00:36:03.248
but we should have already
entered our passcodes.

540
00:36:03.291 --> 00:36:04.466
Guys. I'll be right back.

541
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:22.441
What the hell is this?

542
00:37:06.528 --> 00:37:07.877
Sorry about earlier.

543
00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:11.533
If you say so.
Mr. Williams.

544
00:37:11.577 --> 00:37:13.883
Look. me and Finley.
we're tight.
You knew that.

545
00:37:13.927 --> 00:37:18.801
So were you really surprised
that I was one of.
uh. the chosen?

546
00:37:18.845 --> 00:37:22.544
Mr. Williams.
you put the company at jeopardy

547
00:37:22.588 --> 00:37:25.243
with your erratic behavior
and your dependence issues.

548
00:37:25.286 --> 00:37:26.244
Right.

549
00:37:27.549 --> 00:37:29.116
What time is it there again?

550
00:37:30.509 --> 00:37:32.206
What if we punch in our codes?

551
00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.816
Give it a whirl. sure.

552
00:37:37.342 --> 00:37:38.995
Access denied.

553
00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:40.345
It's case sensitive.

554
00:37:40.388 --> 00:37:42.172
You really are insufferable.

555
00:37:42.216 --> 00:37:43.783
Still no answer
at the Foundation.

556
00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:47.265
Access denied.

557
00:37:48.353 --> 00:37:49.876
May I ask why?

558
00:37:49.919 --> 00:37:52.008
When one or more
Contingency members

559
00:37:52.052 --> 00:37:55.316
are signed. the system
will automatically lock down.

560
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.318
To override
the system lockdown.

561
00:37:57.362 --> 00:38:01.235
please enter the 20-character
secure override password.

562
00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:04.891
- Any ideas. Trevor?
- Twenty characters?

563
00:38:04.934 --> 00:38:07.981
Might have to
think on that a minute.

564
00:38:08.024 --> 00:38:11.332
You have 50 minutes
to input the codes.

565
00:38:11.376 --> 00:38:13.595
Would you like to listen
to music while you wait?

566
00:38:13.639 --> 00:38:16.598
No. No. no. no.
We would not.

567
00:38:18.165 --> 00:38:20.036
What on earth
are you laughing at?

568
00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.344
Nothing. It's--
this is so Finley.

569
00:38:25.825 --> 00:38:28.088
"You will receive
a message on this phone.

570
00:38:28.131 --> 00:38:30.743
Start the video
attached to the message."

571
00:38:32.788 --> 00:38:34.790
Hey. it's me.

572
00:38:34.834 --> 00:38:37.358
So. anything?

573
00:38:37.402 --> 00:38:39.055
There's no sign of forced entry.

574
00:38:39.099 --> 00:38:41.231
And the outside alarm
wasn't triggered.

575
00:38:41.275 --> 00:38:45.627
so whoever it was
had the passcode
to my entire security system.

576
00:38:47.237 --> 00:38:48.500
Wait a second.

577
00:38:55.985 --> 00:38:59.772
"Your legacy is yours
and yours alone."

578
00:39:05.778 --> 00:39:08.607
Hey. counselor.
I'm really sorry
to change the subject

579
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:11.305
because I love talking about
what a piece of shit I am.

580
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:14.482
but I'm tracking this.
uh. secret caller...

581
00:39:17.224 --> 00:39:19.139
And?

582
00:39:19.182 --> 00:39:21.184
I'm getting pinballed
all over the world here.

583
00:39:21.228 --> 00:39:25.537
Hawaii. New York. Little Rock.
Dallas. Texas. No. wait--

584
00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.888
Dallas. Georgia.
Did you guys know
there was a Dallas. Georgia?

585
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:31.369
Mr. Williams.

586
00:39:31.412 --> 00:39:33.849
Right. right.
So. look. the point is

587
00:39:33.893 --> 00:39:37.070
right when I think I'm gonna
pin him down. I get rerouted.

588
00:39:38.201 --> 00:39:39.594
What is it?

589
00:39:39.638 --> 00:39:41.291
Riku. I'm gonna
send you something...

590
00:39:42.945 --> 00:39:45.078
...and you better
get a handle on it.

591
00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:47.036
Call the Foundation.
Do it now.

592
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.430
- I did.
- Keep trying
until you get through.

593
00:39:54.217 --> 00:39:55.567
Oh. shit.

594
00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.095
- Make the call. Do it now.
- Oh. shit. Oh. shit. Oh. shit.

595
00:40:02.138 --> 00:40:03.575
- Oh. shit.
- What?

596
00:40:03.618 --> 00:40:06.099
Did you know there was
a Los Angeles in Chile?

597
00:40:08.144 --> 00:40:11.452
And rerouted again.
Goddamnit.

598
00:40:13.498 --> 00:40:17.371
Oh. great. I was worried
I missed something.

599
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:18.807
Hakan's back up.

600
00:40:25.553 --> 00:40:27.512
- Hey!

601
00:40:29.644 --> 00:40:32.212
Forty-eight minutes remaining.

602
00:40:43.397 --> 00:40:45.355
I'm not even gonna ask
what that was.

603
00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:47.270
I think we should do
what it says.

604
00:40:47.314 --> 00:40:49.969
- Abort mission. Game over.
- I couldn't agree more.

605
00:40:50.012 --> 00:40:52.014
- Thank you.
- We can't.

606
00:40:52.058 --> 00:40:54.364
- We made a commitment.
- Commitment?

607
00:40:54.408 --> 00:40:56.366
Commitment my ass.
Veronica.

608
00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:00.719
No one. I mean. no one
short of Finley Hart himself
can convince me--

609
00:41:00.762 --> 00:41:02.677
We can't punch the code
in anyway.

610
00:41:02.721 --> 00:41:03.722
Why not?

611
00:41:03.765 --> 00:41:05.375
Because the system locks down.

612
00:41:05.419 --> 00:41:08.553
Locks down tight.
requires 20-character password.

613
00:41:08.596 --> 00:41:10.424
Wait. so--
so can you hack it?

614
00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:13.862
Not in the 47 minutes
we have.

615
00:41:13.906 --> 00:41:17.823
Trevor. uh.
I know you were loyal to Finley.

616
00:41:17.866 --> 00:41:21.087
And I was. too.
He-- he taught me everything.

617
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.611
Everything I know.
but we also--

618
00:41:23.655 --> 00:41:27.746
we also need to bear in mind
that he-- he was bat-shit crazy.

619
00:41:27.789 --> 00:41:29.661
He taught you
everything you know.

620
00:41:29.704 --> 00:41:32.011
but he didn't teach you
everything he knew.

621
00:41:32.054 --> 00:41:36.755
He chose you and you accepted.
so we are not aborting

622
00:41:36.798 --> 00:41:40.149
and don't call him
bat-shit crazy.

623
00:41:40.193 --> 00:41:42.412
Why is it that today we are--

624
00:41:42.456 --> 00:41:45.198
nowadays we are.
uh. compelled and--

625
00:41:45.241 --> 00:41:49.071
to use these big. big words
like the truth. the narrative.

626
00:41:49.115 --> 00:41:51.117
and. uh. you know. the optics.

627
00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.556
Ooh. And. uh. why are we so--
we are-- why do we all

628
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.691
so desperately
need to be defined?

629
00:41:59.734 --> 00:42:02.432
Can you tell me?
Because it sure as hell

630
00:42:02.476 --> 00:42:05.131
beats the crap out of me. kiddo.
I'll tell you that.

631
00:42:05.174 --> 00:42:07.699
Anyway. never mind.
it's no problem.

632
00:42:07.742 --> 00:42:10.615
Um. you know. for all
my faults. I just. uh--

633
00:42:10.658 --> 00:42:12.791
simply I wanna make people
better or just.

634
00:42:12.834 --> 00:42:15.315
you know--
not even those around me.

635
00:42:15.358 --> 00:42:17.578
Anyway. thank you
for a wonderful interview.

636
00:42:17.622 --> 00:42:19.275
I really have to go
'cause I'm rather tired.

637
00:42:19.319 --> 00:42:21.147
See. I don't have long
to live. you see?

638
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:22.888
But none of us do. do we?

639
00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:25.760
But then life is a blur.
isn't it. you know?

640
00:42:25.804 --> 00:42:28.197
Yeah.

641
00:42:28.241 --> 00:42:31.070
That's right. an illusion.
A dream within a dream.

642
00:42:31.113 --> 00:42:33.725
Strange twists.
uneasy turns in the road.

643
00:42:33.768 --> 00:42:37.424
Ah. yes. and another thing.
I'll tell you this for--
for free.

644
00:42:37.467 --> 00:42:41.776
Um. there are
far too many people
in that final turn in the road.

645
00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.212
You know what I mean?

646
00:42:43.256 --> 00:42:45.519
Far too many people
who are about to realize

647
00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:48.914
quite suddenly
and only too late. I'm afraid.

648
00:42:48.957 --> 00:42:51.394
that they're about to hit
the fucking wall.

649
00:42:51.438 --> 00:42:53.222
And that nobody cares.

650
00:42:53.266 --> 00:42:57.009
And nobody ever has cared
in the whole of human history.

651
00:42:57.052 --> 00:43:00.273
It's so strange-- strange
little creatures we are.

652
00:43:02.188 --> 00:43:06.714
All right. What good would it do
to contact the Foundation?

653
00:43:06.758 --> 00:43:08.498
Maybe they're aware
of the breach

654
00:43:08.542 --> 00:43:11.284
and can pinpoint the source.

655
00:43:12.677 --> 00:43:14.635
Why did this person
bring Hakan back online?

656
00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:16.637
We couldn't punch in the codes.
He could have stopped us.

657
00:43:16.681 --> 00:43:17.943
Yeah. no shit.

658
00:43:17.986 --> 00:43:21.511
My-- my guess is it's because...

659
00:43:21.555 --> 00:43:25.733
Okay...

660
00:43:25.777 --> 00:43:28.170
- Remember what I said earlier?
- Sort of.

661
00:43:28.214 --> 00:43:29.868
Yeah. the electromagnetic event.

662
00:43:29.911 --> 00:43:35.787
- Yeah. that.
- There's also the possibility

663
00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:41.444
that not inputting the codes
will destabilize the field.

664
00:43:41.488 --> 00:43:44.012
Wait. So the same thing
as putting the--

665
00:43:44.056 --> 00:43:46.624
No. Not-- not exactly
because the power source

666
00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:50.671
has been partially reactivated.

667
00:43:50.715 --> 00:43:54.283
So the theory goes.
it is already expanding

668
00:43:54.327 --> 00:43:58.766
and could fracture
the temporal continuum.

669
00:44:00.463 --> 00:44:04.642
The tem...
the temporal continuum?

670
00:44:06.469 --> 00:44:09.342
Like. reset
the space-time continuum?

671
00:44:09.385 --> 00:44:11.126
I mean. start over.

672
00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:12.998
Back to the Ice Ages.
so to speak.

673
00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:14.608
Jesus.

674
00:44:17.872 --> 00:44:20.005
I mean. it's not a theory
I agree with.

675
00:44:20.048 --> 00:44:23.530
- Hold on.
Forty-five minutes remaining.

676
00:44:23.573 --> 00:44:26.620
I have another number
for the Foundation. Riku.
Try this.

677
00:44:28.143 --> 00:44:31.190
What? Why didn't you
tell us that earlier?

678
00:44:31.233 --> 00:44:33.105
Because I don't
trust any of you.

679
00:44:33.148 --> 00:44:35.498
Okay. I'm tired
of being dragged through
your company bullshit.

680
00:44:35.542 --> 00:44:36.717
I've dealt with it
my whole life.

681
00:44:36.761 --> 00:44:37.892
You didn't earn that money.

682
00:44:37.936 --> 00:44:39.415
You're a trust fund kid.

683
00:44:39.459 --> 00:44:41.156
Did whatever you wanted
your whole life.

684
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.245
waiting around for Daddy
to fill your pockets.

685
00:44:43.289 --> 00:44:45.291
Don't. No. Don't pretend

Now. here we are.
As you remember. I. um--

732

I guess.

it was that glorious dream.

Yeah. East of Carmel.

East of Eden. I used to call it
'cause that's where
it all started. wasn't it?

00:48:55.367 --> 00:48:57.717
The Land of Nod
on the East of Eden.

746

The Hart Enterprise.

They were all really crazy.

748

of them. Did you know that?

749
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.336
Yeah. I was bored
out of my skull.

750

I'd been for years now
for the big...
and all...

751

00:49:14.603 --> 00:49:16.083
Well. talk about God.

753
00:49:16.127 --> 00:49:17.867
Yeah. Aldous Huxley.
he was my God.

754
00:49:17.911 --> 00:49:21.088
The Doors of Perception.

755
00:49:22.176 --> 00:49:23.743
God.

756
00:49:25.266 --> 00:49:27.225
Yeah.
that's when it all started.

757
00:49:28.791 --> 00:49:31.620
You think I'm crazy?
I'm not.

758
00:49:31.664 --> 00:49:34.797
But I'm sure
you must realize by now
that I'm very much alive.

760
00:49:36.582 --> 00:49:39.846
I. uh. can't reveal
my location to you. of course.

761
00:49:39.889 --> 00:49:43.328
and I cannot. um.
communicate with you
in any other way.

762
00:49:43.371 --> 00:49:45.634
But my death.
or my so-called death.

763
00:49:45.678 --> 00:49:47.854
was something
that had to happen.

764

out of the Hart Enterprises

772

to remain functional.

773
00:50:11.269 --> 00:50:17.101

and vital to humanity
that it does remain functional.

774
00:50:17.144 --> 00:50:18.276
You understand?

775
00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:20.278
It will not be enough for them.

776
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:21.975
uh. you know. to--
They'll talk to you

777
00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:23.672
and try to persuade you
to stop. No.

778
00:50:23.716 --> 00:50:26.240
Because they will keep coming.
They will not stop!

779
00:50:26.284 --> 00:50:28.808
Because they're adamant.
you know?

780
00:50:28.851 --> 00:50:33.073
And beware because these are
the real psychos.
the real wackos.

781
00:50:33.117 --> 00:50:36.642
The only way
you can beat them is to.
um. punch in those codes.

782
00:50:36.685 --> 00:50:39.340
And you have. in my estimation.
just under an hour.

783
00:50:39.384 --> 00:50:41.429
Anyway. this is the point--

784
00:50:41.473 --> 00:50:43.779
'Cause these clowns.
if they. um.

785
00:50:43.823 --> 00:50:45.999
can prevent you
or stop you or. you know.

786
00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:48.741
even hack into codes.
the machine will rupture

787
00:50:48.784 --> 00:50:52.658
and cause a globe-killing
disaster event.

788
00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:54.225
And it'll be bye-bye.

789
00:50:54.268 --> 00:50:57.663
And I'm serious. you know?

790
00:50:57.706 --> 00:51:01.449
So. um-- and they
will not stop. you know?

791
00:51:01.493 --> 00:51:03.712
They will come and find you.
I mean. for example.

792
00:51:03.756 --> 00:51:05.932
the only one in their group.

793
00:51:05.975 --> 00:51:07.977
in your group.
that they knew about
was that guy Hakan.

794
00:51:08.021 --> 00:51:10.110
and they'll find
the rest of you

795
00:51:10.154 --> 00:51:11.894
because. you know. uh.
boundaries don't matter.

796
00:51:11.938 --> 00:51:13.940
and distance doesn't matter.

797
00:51:13.983 --> 00:51:16.247
You know.
I'm halfway around the world

798
00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:19.685

with you in. um.

799
00:51:19.728 --> 00:51:21.730
it was a millisecond.
wasn't it?

800

what else was I gonna say?

801
00:51:24.907 --> 00:51:27.867

I have a-- I've got--

802

uh. Sam.

803
00:51:30.652 --> 00:51:33.742
I'll explain it later.
But I've placed the device

804
00:51:33.786 --> 00:51:38.747
in a box together with.
uh. several face masks. okay?

805
00:51:38.791 --> 00:51:41.837

the box is in the closet

806
00:51:41.881 --> 00:51:45.624
of the bedroom you used
when you came to visit me.
Do you remember?

807
00:51:45.667 --> 00:51:49.367
So you must get the box
and you must wear
the face mask at all costs.

808
00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:51.760
What else was I gonna say?
That's about it. I think.

809
00:51:51.804 --> 00:51:53.371
Um...

810
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:56.069

00:55:30.196 --> 00:55:31.589
No?

851
00:55:32.285 --> 00:55:33.373
Um...

852
00:55:36.115 --> 00:55:40.032
My dad would always
be chasing funding.
you know. when I was a kid.

853
00:55:41.599 --> 00:55:45.733
And. uh.
he had some Wall Street guy.

854
00:55:45.777 --> 00:55:49.650
just had him on the hook.
Just trying to reel him in.

855
00:55:49.694 --> 00:55:54.394
And it was the one. like.
business trip that he took me on

856
00:55:54.438 --> 00:55:56.788
that he actually
spent any time with me.

857
00:55:56.831 --> 00:55:58.137
It was the one time.

858
00:56:00.008 --> 00:56:05.884
So he ended up taking me
to Coney Island.

859
00:56:05.927 --> 00:56:09.757
and then. uh.
he put me on the Cyclone.

860
00:56:09.801 --> 00:56:12.064
You know. the place.
like the old--

861
00:56:12.107 --> 00:56:16.634
just some rickety.
old wooden roller coaster.

862
00:56:16.677 --> 00:56:21.421
And I must have ridden that
a dozen times. and...

863
00:56:25.294 --> 00:56:27.471
I don't know--
you know. I go around

864
00:56:27.514 --> 00:56:30.038
and I-- I'd see his face
in the crowd.

865
00:56:30.082 --> 00:56:32.214
I'd wave and smile.

866
00:56:32.258 --> 00:56:34.129
You know. he--
he'd wave and smile back.

867
00:56:34.173 --> 00:56:35.783
and it would just.
you know. just go around.

868
00:56:35.827 --> 00:56:40.788
And every time that was our--
that was a thing.

869
00:56:40.832 --> 00:56:43.878
Until one time it came around
and he just wasn't there.

870
00:56:47.491 --> 00:56:49.275
He got a page and left.

871
00:56:51.495 --> 00:56:52.713
I was nine.

872
00:56:56.587 --> 00:56:58.415
It felt like I--
I had gotten swallowed up

873
00:56:58.458 --> 00:57:01.853
into just a sea of people.

874
00:57:01.896 --> 00:57:07.467
And I was terrified. so I just--
I-- I ran to the beach.

875
00:57:07.511 --> 00:57:09.774
and I just walked
up and down the shoreline

876
00:57:09.817 --> 00:57:13.386
just sobbing until
my Aunt Rebecca picked me up.

877
00:57:17.738 --> 00:57:19.697
He came-- I don't know.

878
00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.003
it was like a couple days
later he came back.

879
00:57:23.614 --> 00:57:27.922
And he said.
"Hey. my bad. kid.

880
00:57:27.966 --> 00:57:29.446
I won't do it again."

881
00:57:31.491 --> 00:57:35.800
And I-- I think about
that specific time all the time.

882
00:57:35.843 --> 00:57:40.761
and I feel embarrassed
because I believed him.

883
00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:46.245
That was the one trip
we did anything fun.

884
00:57:48.421 --> 00:57:51.032
My Aunt Rebecca wouldn't let me
see him after that.

885
00:57:52.381 --> 00:57:57.517
So. I can't just blindly trust

886
00:57:57.561 --> 00:57:59.780
anything that he's saying
to just be the truth.

887
00:58:00.868 --> 00:58:02.479
I understand.

888
00:58:05.177 --> 00:58:06.439
Okay.

889
00:58:06.483 --> 00:58:08.441
I'm gonna log back online.

890
00:58:08.485 --> 00:58:10.008
I'm gonna see if I can
wrap my head around this.

891
00:58:10.051 --> 00:58:12.314
Um. but. hey. I love you.

892
00:58:36.164 --> 00:58:38.166
Welcome back. everyone.

893
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:41.430
So I talked to William
at the Foundation.

894
00:58:41.474 --> 00:58:42.997
Check out Hakan's window.

895
00:58:44.346 --> 00:58:46.305
Who the hell is that guy?

896
00:58:46.348 --> 00:58:47.698
What the hell is going on?

897
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:53.268
Access code accepted.

898
00:58:53.312 --> 00:58:55.532
Thirty-five minutes remaining.

899
00:59:08.675 --> 00:59:10.982
I recommend
that each of us punch in--

900
00:59:11.591 --> 00:59:13.245
Hang on.

901
00:59:14.812 --> 00:59:16.683
Mom. who's that man outside?

902
00:59:31.089 --> 00:59:32.960
Veronica?

903
00:59:33.004 --> 00:59:34.875
- Veronica?
- What?

904
00:59:34.919 --> 00:59:36.790
Hey. is there some place
in your house you can hide?

905
00:59:36.834 --> 00:59:38.662
- Why?
- This man. he'll do

906
00:59:38.705 --> 00:59:40.402
the exact same thing to you
he did to Hakan. okay?

907
00:59:40.446 --> 00:59:42.100
This is way bigger
than we know it is.

908
00:59:42.143 --> 00:59:45.146
- What? How do you know?
- Listen. I just know.

909
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:48.019
Yeah. but how?
Half hour ago you were all.

910
00:59:48.062 --> 00:59:50.499
- "What are here for?"
and now you're an expert.

911
00:59:50.543 --> 00:59:53.067
- He's trying to
get into my house.

912
00:59:53.111 --> 00:59:55.069
Do not let him
get the password.

913
00:59:56.375 --> 00:59:58.333
Can you get out of there?

914
00:59:58.377 --> 01:00:00.292
- And go where?

915
01:00:00.335 --> 01:00:01.989
Okay. is there some place
in your house you can hide?

916
01:00:04.557 --> 01:00:07.429
♪♪

917
01:00:07.473 --> 01:00:09.170
Mom.

918
01:00:24.185 --> 01:00:26.492
Oh fuck.

919
01:01:06.575 --> 01:01:09.187
I'm not here to hurt you.

920
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:11.363
Just tell me
where your computer is.

921
01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:15.323
Where is your computer?

922
01:01:31.078 --> 01:01:35.126
- Veronica?
-Ms. Schultz
has disconnected.

923
01:01:35.169 --> 01:01:36.954
Is there another way
she can punch in her code?

924
01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:40.566
Where are you going?

925
01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:42.263
- Uh. I got to get some air.
- Get some air?

926
01:01:42.307 --> 01:01:44.701
Yes. some air. dammit. This shit
is freaking me out. okay?

927
01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:46.746
I need to go out.
clear my head.
Is that okay with you?

928
01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:49.357
- Sure. Whatever.
- Yeah. sure. Whatever.

929
01:01:49.401 --> 01:01:52.186
Thirty minutes remaining.
One passcode received.

930
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:53.927
Uh. come on.

931
01:01:53.971 --> 01:01:56.103
Four passcodes remaining.

932
01:02:12.424 --> 01:02:13.555
Is he gone?

933
01:02:19.474 --> 01:02:20.693
Shh.

934
01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:36.491
Veronica?
It's me. Sam.

935
01:02:36.535 --> 01:02:39.494
- Sam?
- Yes. it's me. Sam Hart.

936
01:02:39.538 --> 01:02:41.409
That's impossible.
How did you--?

937
01:02:41.453 --> 01:02:42.846
I don't know.

938
01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:45.457
That song.

939
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.285
Veronica. when I was little.

940
01:02:47.328 --> 01:02:49.548
I remember one time
he was driving us somewhere

941
01:02:49.591 --> 01:02:51.332
and that song came on.

942
01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:56.250
He smiled. turned it up.
and I had never seen him
like that.

943
01:02:56.294 --> 01:02:58.296
And I asked him
why he liked that song so much

944
01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:01.516
and he said.
"It reminded me of someone."

945
01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.562
He talked about you.

946
01:03:03.605 --> 01:03:06.870
I never knew who you were
but I knew about you.

947
01:03:08.828 --> 01:03:11.048
He loved you. I know that.

948
01:03:11.091 --> 01:03:14.181
I know he loved you both
very much.

949
01:03:15.661 --> 01:03:18.664
When I leave.
you have to put in those codes.

950
01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:22.363
Do you have another computer?
Yours is shot.

951
01:03:22.407 --> 01:03:24.583
- Jamie--
- Yeah. Yeah. I do.

952
01:03:24.626 --> 01:03:26.585
We have.

953
01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:29.762
Veronica. you really
loved him. didn't you?

954
01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.503
It was more than--

955
01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:38.553
It was more than anyone will--
will ever understand. Sam.

956
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:43.907
That song. it means something.
doesn't it?

957
01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:47.258
I saw your face
when the song started.

958
01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:50.827
It looked like it took you
back to something.

959
01:03:54.352 --> 01:03:58.573
We went to Sydney
to close a deal. All business.

960
01:03:58.617 --> 01:04:01.446
He was always all business.
you know?

961
01:04:05.145 --> 01:04:08.670
Finley. me. and a few others
went out to celebrate.

962
01:04:08.714 --> 01:04:10.542
We went to some dive bar.

963
01:04:10.585 --> 01:04:12.936
You know how much
he loved dive bars.

964
01:04:15.242 --> 01:04:16.722
And...

965
01:04:20.682 --> 01:04:23.685
that song was playing.

966
01:04:23.729 --> 01:04:26.123
and I couldn't convince him
that it was not called

967
01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.516
"If You Like Pina Coladas."

968
01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:36.133
It was the first time
I saw him as a...

969
01:04:38.396 --> 01:04:39.876
as a real person.

970
01:04:45.403 --> 01:04:48.623
He has difficulty
letting people in. Sam.

971
01:04:50.451 --> 01:04:51.888
But when he does...

972
01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.109
it's permanent.

973
01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:03.638
Veronica.
I can see why he loved you.

974
01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:05.075
Jamie.

975
01:05:07.425 --> 01:05:08.948
Okay. I'll see you soon.

976
01:05:21.526 --> 01:05:22.570
Yeah.

977
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:34.887
- Here. Mom.
- Thank you.

978
01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:37.107
Thank you. Jamie.
Oh. my God.

979
01:05:49.728 --> 01:05:51.773
Ah. attagirl.

980
01:06:09.574 --> 01:06:12.881
Override lockdown
code accepted.

981
01:06:12.925 --> 01:06:16.668
In the event
one or more parties sign off.

982
01:06:16.711 --> 01:06:19.236
the system
will no longer lock down.

983
01:06:21.238 --> 01:06:25.546
Passcode accepted.
Twenty-five minutes remaining.

984
01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:27.940
Three passcodes remaining.

985
01:06:38.168 --> 01:06:40.213
Hey. okay. um.
can you do me a favor?

986
01:06:40.257 --> 01:06:41.780
What?

987
01:06:41.823 --> 01:06:43.303
I need you to look into
Hart Enterprises

988
01:06:43.347 --> 01:06:45.740
and see who opposed Finley.

989
01:06:45.784 --> 01:06:49.048
Who was the one
that forced him out. okay?

990
01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:50.354
Okay. Thank you. baby.
I love you.

991
01:06:58.623 --> 01:07:01.147
Riku. who did you
talk to at the Foundation?

992
01:07:01.191 --> 01:07:02.801
A man named William.

993
01:07:03.889 --> 01:07:05.021
How did you get the technology?

994
01:07:05.064 --> 01:07:06.718
That-- that's a long story.

995
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:08.763
William's not on our side--
Finley's side.

996
01:07:08.807 --> 01:07:11.592
- How do you know?
- Trust me.

997
01:07:11.636 --> 01:07:14.508
Wait. He was--
he was at Veronica's?

998
01:07:14.552 --> 01:07:16.336
Yes.

999
01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.121
How can you be sure
it was him?

1000
01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:20.123
You've never been
involved in-- in--

1001
01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:21.820
Because he's my cousin.

1002
01:07:24.301 --> 01:07:26.781
Riku. how sure are you
about both scenarios?

1003
01:07:26.825 --> 01:07:30.742
I'm reasonably certain
that if we punch in the codes.
the machine will melt down.

1004
01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:32.787
I need you to quantify
your certainty.

1005
01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:36.095
Well. according to the test
we ran and the research--

1006
01:07:36.139 --> 01:07:39.359
No. no.
Just give me the number.

1007
01:07:39.403 --> 01:07:43.407
Seventy percent chance
that the machine will melt--
melt down.

1008
01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.626
And if we don't input the codes?

1009
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:49.108
It's an 11% chance
not inputting the codes will--

1010
01:07:49.152 --> 01:07:51.023
No. Why-- why the variance?
That doesn't make sense.

1011
01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.330
'Cause the-- the power source
is unstable.

1012
01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:56.159
And there's a chance that...

1013
01:07:58.117 --> 01:08:00.293
There's a chance
that your-- your-- your father

1014
01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:02.556
rigged the machine.

1015
01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.995
What does he care? He's dead.
It-- it-- it won't affect him.

1016
01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:09.172
Who did you call. Riku?

1017
01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:12.566
What? I called the Foundation.

1018
01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:15.917
No. no. You called someone else.
Who was it?

1019
01:08:15.961 --> 01:08:18.572
And when Hakan saw the person
in his front yard

1020
01:08:18.616 --> 01:08:21.097
and he said that they appeared
dizzy and nauseous.

1021
01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:23.229
you knew what was happening.
didn't you?

1022
01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:25.144
No. I don't-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

1023
01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:27.625
You know about this tech.
don't you?

1024
01:08:27.668 --> 01:08:30.671
You know among other things
that it can cause
vestibular disorder.

1025
01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:32.456
Answer him. Riku.

1026
01:08:32.499 --> 01:08:34.240
You told us
the tech never functioned.

1027
01:08:34.284 --> 01:08:36.938
but that was a lie. wasn't it?

1028
01:08:36.982 --> 01:08:39.985
Did you know that the person
who killed Hakan

1029
01:08:40.028 --> 01:08:43.162
was using
the displacement technology?

1030
01:08:43.206 --> 01:08:44.381
Answer me. Riku!

1031
01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:45.556
- Answer him!

1032
01:08:47.688 --> 01:08:49.516
I had my suspicions.

1033
01:08:55.522 --> 01:08:58.656
- Hello. Douglas.
- They've entered
two numbers already.

1034
01:08:58.699 --> 01:09:03.530
Yes. William told me.
What's your read on Riku?

1035
01:09:03.574 --> 01:09:07.534
- Think he'll cave to Sam?
- No. No way.

1036
01:09:07.578 --> 01:09:10.581
Rebecca. you tell William
he's off limits.

1037
01:09:10.624 --> 01:09:14.106
- We had conducted
successful tests before.
- When?

1038
01:09:16.021 --> 01:09:19.329
I can be there
in less than a minute
to ask you face to face.

1039
01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:23.637
Back when I was
at Hart Enterprises.

1040
01:09:23.681 --> 01:09:28.555
your father had disagreements
about how to best improve
the technology.

1041
01:09:28.599 --> 01:09:31.776
Is that why you teamed up with
my aunt and Doug Mancini
to orchestrate a coup?

1042
01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:33.995
Your father
was acting erratically!

1043
01:09:34.039 --> 01:09:37.434
He was sick! He was-- he was--
he was a megalomaniac!

1044
01:09:38.696 --> 01:09:40.654
Your brother
completely miscalculated

1045
01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:43.396
what Riku brings to the table.

1046
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:46.704
I mean. that's how I recruited
the guy in the first place.
right?

1047
01:09:46.747 --> 01:09:51.099
Yes. but you didn't
exactly recruit him

1048
01:09:51.143 --> 01:09:53.319
for his resolve. did you?

1049
01:09:59.369 --> 01:10:01.153
I'll tell William
that he's an ally.

1050
01:10:03.503 --> 01:10:04.504
Anything else?

1051
01:10:04.548 --> 01:10:05.549
Yeah.

1052
01:10:08.073 --> 01:10:09.944
Hakan was dead.

1053
01:10:09.988 --> 01:10:15.080
So someone had to punch in
his code for him.

1054
01:10:15.123 --> 01:10:18.257
You think we have
a wildcard in the game?

1055
01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:19.911
You think we don't?

1056
01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:25.482
I'll talk to William.

1057
01:10:25.525 --> 01:10:30.400
You convince Riku to stick to
his guns for 19 more minutes.

1058
01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:33.707
♪♪

1059
01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:40.323
Shit.

1060
01:10:40.366 --> 01:10:42.281
So what's it gonna be?
Are you gonna punch in the code?

1061
01:10:44.457 --> 01:10:46.372
I'm scared to.

1062
01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:48.766
Finley may have been
who you say he was.

1063
01:10:48.809 --> 01:10:50.637
I know he was a shitty father.

1064
01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:53.684
But he was also a visionary.
and this is his life.

1065
01:10:53.727 --> 01:10:55.903
And you're gonna--
you're gonna break
your commitment to him

1066
01:10:55.947 --> 01:10:58.689
just because Rebecca's
better for the bottom line?

1067
01:10:58.732 --> 01:11:00.343
Punch in your code.

1068
01:11:01.561 --> 01:11:03.998
Punch in your code. Riku!

1069
01:11:04.042 --> 01:11:06.740
- No! Do not answer that.

1070
01:11:06.784 --> 01:11:09.482
You-- I know you wanna do
the right thing here.

1071
01:11:12.311 --> 01:11:14.748
- Riku. punch in your code!

1072
01:11:37.597 --> 01:11:39.251
Damn it!

1073
01:12:27.517 --> 01:12:30.520
Riku Matsuda has disconnected.

1074
01:12:30.563 --> 01:12:32.696
Seventeen minutes remaining.

1075
01:12:50.627 --> 01:12:52.324
Trevor. you still with me?

1076
01:12:54.674 --> 01:12:56.110
I don't know who I'm with.

1077
01:13:06.773 --> 01:13:09.297
I thought you said
you were getting used to it.

1078
01:13:09.341 --> 01:13:10.821
I thought I was.

1079
01:13:14.259 --> 01:13:16.957
I'll be all right.

1080
01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:18.568
When are you
leaving for Trevor's?

1081
01:13:20.221 --> 01:13:22.963
I have Riku's computer
and his passcode.

1082
01:13:23.007 --> 01:13:25.792
- I mean. there's no need--
- Did you destroy his computer?

1083
01:13:25.836 --> 01:13:28.229
Not yet. I just made it back.

1084
01:13:28.273 --> 01:13:30.101
and I've been
chundering in the loo.

1085
01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:33.974
Destroy it. Finish this.

1086
01:13:55.126 --> 01:13:56.344
He's gonna kill me.

1087
01:14:00.784 --> 01:14:02.916
Hey. You having fun?

1088
01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.267
Babe. you look stressed.

1089
01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:11.142
Yeah. Yeah. I know.
Look. uh. I'm really sorry.

1090
01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:14.493
but I'm right in the middle
of something really important.

1091
01:14:14.537 --> 01:14:17.061
- and I can't explain it.
- Are you gonna make it?

1092
01:14:17.104 --> 01:14:18.889
Of course. yeah.
I'm gonna make it.

1093
01:14:18.932 --> 01:14:21.457
Why can't you
go to the Foundation.
or whatever you call it?

1094
01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.546
Finley didn't leave me
the coordinates.

1095
01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:25.765
- Were you close
with your cousin?
- Not really.

1096
01:14:25.809 --> 01:14:28.986
I mean. my aunt favored him.
but why wouldn't she?

1097
01:14:29.029 --> 01:14:31.162
Okay. Um. I got to go.
I'll-- I'll call you back.

1098
01:14:31.205 --> 01:14:34.252
Um. I am just gonna go home.

1099
01:14:34.295 --> 01:14:36.863
So. I'll see you
in a little bit.

1100
01:14:36.907 --> 01:14:38.996
You're the best.
Foot rubs for a month. okay?

1101
01:14:39.039 --> 01:14:42.303
And more. All right.
I'll see you soon. Bye. babe.

1102
01:14:50.224 --> 01:14:52.009
How long you been together?

1103
01:14:52.052 --> 01:14:54.359
Fourteen years.

1104
01:14:54.402 --> 01:14:55.665
- Where'd you meet?
- Come on.

1105
01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:57.971
Don't start
this buddy-buddy stuff. Sam.

1106
01:14:58.015 --> 01:15:01.105
Out of all the people
in this mess.
I trust you the least.

1107
01:15:01.148 --> 01:15:02.628
Why is that?

1108
01:15:02.672 --> 01:15:05.196
Because nothing
about you adds up.

1109
01:15:05.239 --> 01:15:07.633
You don't trust Finley.
you do trust Finley.

1110
01:15:07.677 --> 01:15:09.243
You don't wanna
punch in the codes.

1111
01:15:09.287 --> 01:15:11.637
then you do wanna
punch in the code.

1112
01:15:11.681 --> 01:15:15.249
Riku's gone.
Hakan's dead. Veronica--

1113
01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:19.384
Look. the only person I trust
in all of this is Finley.
and he's gone. too.

1114
01:15:19.427 --> 01:15:21.778
And that man took me in
after I messed up.

1115
01:15:21.821 --> 01:15:24.345
But you. you. you...

1116
01:15:30.003 --> 01:15:32.876
Why didn't you
just go save Riku. hmm?

1117
01:15:32.919 --> 01:15:34.312
Like you did Veronica?

1118
01:15:34.355 --> 01:15:36.749
I could--
I thought I could convince him.

1119
01:15:36.793 --> 01:15:40.448
Or zip over. and punch in
the code like you did Hakan.

1120
01:15:40.492 --> 01:15:42.059
Like I did what?

1121
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:44.757
Hey.

1122
01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.852
Sam. can you hear me?

1123
01:15:52.896 --> 01:15:55.594
Anyway. I tell you.

1124
01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:58.162
if you don't punch in
those codes. it's over.

1125
01:15:58.205 --> 01:16:00.686
You got me?
We are dead. we're all dead.

1126
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:02.514
Babe. I told you--

1127
01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:04.603
- I have your wife.
- Who the hell are you?

1128
01:16:04.647 --> 01:16:06.649
I know more about
the power sources

1129
01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:10.000
of that machine
than anyone on this planet.

1130
01:16:10.043 --> 01:16:13.481
and you better believe
because they've severely
underestimated its stability.

1131
01:16:13.525 --> 01:16:17.442
I won't harm her.
so long as you comply.

1132
01:16:17.485 --> 01:16:19.226
You goddamn son of a bitch.

1133
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:20.750
- Trevor--
- If you hurt her.

1134
01:16:20.793 --> 01:16:22.665
if you hurt her.
I swear to God!

1135
01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:27.147
No threats. Trevor.
Do not put in the code.

1136
01:16:27.191 --> 01:16:30.194
Just tell Trevor
something from me. would you?

1137
01:16:31.848 --> 01:16:33.589
I want you to tell him about

1138
01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:35.460
that night he met
his wife. Taylor.

1139
01:16:35.503 --> 01:16:38.637
They were in the Florida Keys.
a hole in the wall dive bar.

1140
01:16:38.681 --> 01:16:39.943
in Marathon. I think it was.

1141
01:16:41.118 --> 01:16:43.337
Okay. O-okay.

1142
01:16:43.381 --> 01:16:47.472
Okay. What do you want me to do?
Just don't hurt her.

1143
01:16:47.515 --> 01:16:50.170
Destroy your laptop.
Stay in your apartment.

1144
01:16:50.214 --> 01:16:52.172
When I have proof
you've destroyed it--

1145
01:16:52.216 --> 01:16:55.219
Okay. Okay. just hold on.
I'll do it right now.

1146
01:16:57.308 --> 01:17:00.441
Fourteen minutes remaining.

1147
01:17:00.485 --> 01:17:03.183
Spotted 20 bucks and. uh.
told him to buy her a drink.

1148
01:17:08.449 --> 01:17:11.191
Trevor. no. no. no!
Hey. stop. stop!
What's going on?

1149
01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:13.063
He's gonna kill my wife!

1150
01:17:13.106 --> 01:17:16.544
Trevor. st-- no. no.
Trevor. he's lying.

1151
01:17:16.588 --> 01:17:18.721
- We have to input the codes.

1152
01:17:18.764 --> 01:17:19.852
Trevor. listen. listen.

1153
01:17:24.161 --> 01:17:25.902
Trevor. no. no!

1154
01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:28.295
We have to input the codes.

1155
01:17:28.339 --> 01:17:31.603
He's got my wife.

1156
01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:35.085
Okay. what if the only person
that you trust is still alive?

1157
01:17:35.128 --> 01:17:38.958
He remembers when you met
your wife in the Florida Keys.

1158
01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:41.265
at a--
at a dive bar in Marathon.

1159
01:17:41.308 --> 01:17:43.789
Uh. you were drinking
margaritas and shooting pool.

1160
01:17:43.833 --> 01:17:45.965
And he-- um. she came in
with her friend.

1161
01:17:46.009 --> 01:17:48.359
She was so pretty. made you
scratch on the eight ball.

1162
01:17:48.402 --> 01:17:51.667
And then. you lost.
uh. your last 20 bucks.

1163
01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:53.538
and you came over to me.
and you said--

1164
01:17:53.581 --> 01:17:55.148
Back off. Finster.

1165
01:17:55.192 --> 01:17:56.759
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

1166
01:17:56.802 --> 01:18:00.632
Yes! And then. he spotted you
a 20 to buy her a drink.

1167
01:18:04.244 --> 01:18:05.637
I traced that call.

1168
01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:10.860
All this time. I traced it.

1169
01:18:10.903 --> 01:18:13.036
He wants you
to put in your code.

1170
01:18:13.079 --> 01:18:15.778
Nine minutes remaining.

1171
01:18:26.005 --> 01:18:27.224
Let me talk to her.

1172
01:18:27.267 --> 01:18:28.616
I said no threats.

1173
01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.445
- Okay. I'll destroy it.
- Trevor. no. no!

1174
01:18:31.489 --> 01:18:33.447
Just give me
five seconds with her.

1175
01:18:33.491 --> 01:18:36.799
That's all I need.
Prove to me that she's okay.

1176
01:18:48.245 --> 01:18:50.377
- Hey. babe.
- Hey.

1177
01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:51.727
What's happening?

1178
01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.272
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1179
01:19:15.315 --> 01:19:16.926
Run. baby. run. run!

1180
01:19:16.969 --> 01:19:18.318
Run. baby.

1181
01:19:18.362 --> 01:19:21.800
I'll kill you!
Get back here!

1182
01:19:21.844 --> 01:19:23.454
- Babe. let me in.
- Ma'am.

1183
01:19:23.497 --> 01:19:24.760
- Let me in.
- In here.

1184
01:19:26.283 --> 01:19:28.546
- Ma'am. are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1185
01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:36.554
I guess I'll find out

01:33:51.713 --> 01:33:54.367
because that can be
the reason to actually see

1350
01:33:54.411 --> 01:33:56.718
what they're scanning.
and see what it says.

1351
01:33:56.761 --> 01:33:59.938
You know. we never
see enough of the laptop
to notice who it is.

1352
01:33:59.982 --> 01:34:02.114
We just know that mother
and daughter together.

1353
01:34:02.158 --> 01:34:05.117
they usually go as one.
she just asked if her daughter
had a laptop.

1354
01:34:05.161 --> 01:34:07.032
And I'm rerouting.

1355
01:34:08.730 --> 01:34:12.255
Are you really married
to an adult?

1356
01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:28.924
What essentially
we would wanna do.

1357
01:34:28.967 --> 01:34:32.710
is we would score
the 92 minutes. um.

1358
01:34:32.754 --> 01:34:37.236
with a brain wave
frequency matrix

1359
01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:41.284
that would help to
further enhance the emotion

1360
01:34:41.327 --> 01:34:43.852
that's being captured
on the screen.

1361
01:34:43.895 --> 01:34:46.202
as you're going through
different scenes.

1362
01:34:58.083 --> 01:35:00.695
That was awesome.
TJ killed it.

1363
01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:06.004
I hope that water pipe's
not gonna break now.

1364
01:35:15.013 --> 01:35:16.754
Let's give it up for Alex. man.

1365
01:35:16.798 --> 01:35:18.321
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

1366
01:35:18.364 --> 01:35:19.801
Alex. man.
You've killed it. dude.

1367
01:35:22.064 --> 01:35:25.023
Riveting performance
over Zoom.

1368
01:35:25.067 --> 01:35:27.809
- Oh. my God.

1369
01:35:27.852 --> 01:35:32.030
Everybody can come
off of their muted.
uh. video screens here.

1370
01:35:32.074 --> 01:35:36.121
And give it up for Jim
for joining us.
for having patience with us.

1371
01:35:36.165 --> 01:35:38.254
and for knocking it
out of the park.

1372
01:35:38.297 --> 01:35:41.561
Really well done. sir.
We'll cut it there.

1373
01:35:41.605 --> 01:35:44.477
- Yay.
- Great work. Great work.

1374
01:35:44.521 --> 01:35:47.263
Wow. Yeah!

1375
01:35:48.525 --> 01:35:50.048
Yeah. buddy!

1376
01:35:52.442 --> 01:35:55.706
I will put the crown
of-- of great performance

1377
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.186
back on your head.
once that one's off.

1378
01:35:57.229 --> 01:36:00.842
Oh hey.

1379
01:36:00.885 --> 01:36:04.236
You as well. as we float
down that long river...

1380
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.110
of all our happy yesterdays.

1381
01:36:08.153 --> 01:36:10.503
Ta-ta. Bye-bye.
