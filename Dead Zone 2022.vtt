00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.646
And in those six years.
how many times have I told you

34
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.149
She does not like surprises.

MASTER CHIEF:
CDC contracted a lab

52
00:05:48.356 --> 00:05:51.609
in this little one-horse town
for vaccine development.

53
00:05:51.692 --> 00:05:54.070
Four weeks ago.
it was declared a D-Zone.

54
00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:55.946
Your mission
is to infil that lab

55
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.491
and secure
that prototype vaccine.

56
00:05:58.574 --> 00:06:00.868
And then haul-ass
onto the extraction point.

57
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:03.329
So. we suit up. grab and go. Where's the problem?

58
00:06:03.412 --> 00:06:04.413
MASTER CHIEF:
Well. the problem is

59
00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:07.124
that intel informs us
that some of the infected

60
00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:08.584
are surviving the blast.

61
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.462
Yeah. that's right.

62
00:06:11.545 --> 00:06:12.463
MASTER CHIEF:
Apparently.

63
00:06:12.546 --> 00:06:15.800
these sons of bitches
are silent. faster.

64
00:06:15.883 --> 00:06:17.259
and more aggressive
than any runners

65
00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:19.553
that you've exterminated
in the past.

66
00:06:19.637 --> 00:06:21.430
So. this. uh...

67
00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:23.224
prototype vaccine
must be some kind

68
00:06:23.307 --> 00:06:25.101
of Messiah shot.

69
00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.311
Why aren't the brass
sending in a full battalion?

70
00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:28.688
To redirect
several hundred troops

71
00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:31.315
to extract an unproven vaccine
from a D-Zone

72
00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:34.402
that's swarming with infected
sup'ed-up assholes?

73
00:06:34.485 --> 00:06:35.945
No.

74
00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:38.489
That'd be more like genocide
than a game plan.

75
00:06:38.572 --> 00:06:42.034
What I need. a few canaries

76
00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:46.539
to slip in. sniff around.
and sneak out undetected.

77
00:06:46.622 --> 00:06:47.873
Canaries?

78
00:06:47.957 --> 00:06:49.917
No.
Maybe that was a bad example.

79
00:06:51.127 --> 00:06:52.253
What do you think?

80
00:06:53.671 --> 00:06:56.549
Yep. you'll HALO in
via this baby.

81
00:06:56.632 --> 00:06:58.426
Now. don't get excited.

82
00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.845
I know it's not the prettiest horse in the barn.

83
00:07:00.928 --> 00:07:01.887
Little long in the tooth.

84
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:03.723
but it's got all the luck
where it's needed.

85
00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:07.143
Plus. it's the best I could do
on such short notice.

87
00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.565

you get your frog-man on.
you suit up. and you follow me.

94
00:07:33.043 --> 00:07:35.463

you'll notice.

101
00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:55.733

00:08:01.864 --> 00:08:03.574

they already nuked the town.

107
00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:06.202

By the way. the more you move.
the better they work.

112
00:08:16.003 --> 00:08:19.298
And if it gives you any trouble.
I'll be right there to fix it.

113
00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:23.302
Unless you desert me again.

114
00:08:27.681 --> 00:08:28.682
Deserter?

115
00:08:30.851 --> 00:08:32.937
Now. that's a new low
even for you.

116
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.105

If memory serves.

119
00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:42.071
I had an easy choice.
stay with your sorry ass

120
00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:43.572
or go home
with the most beautiful woman

to an R&D desk job.

129
00:09:03.217 --> 00:09:06.053
was nearly my brother-in-law.

130

131
00:09:07.763 --> 00:09:08.722
Is she seein' anyone right now?

this thin-ass fabric

is gonna keep me from roastin'?

140
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:23.612
That's the idea.

141
00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:26.282
MASTER CHIEF:
Now. this particular configuration

142
00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:27.533
is hot off the factory floor.

143

we haven't had a lot of time

to test it
considering the situation.

145

for Dead Zone ops.

00:09:54.059 --> 00:09:54.977
Good coms.

156
00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.854
On your visors.
you got a basic HUD.

157
00:09:56.937 --> 00:09:58.480
On your ears.
you got an AMP system

158
00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:00.691
for suit-to-suit comms
and increased audibility.

159
00:10:00.774 --> 00:10:03.235
Soft sounds become loud.
loud becomes soft.

160
00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:05.613
Now. each helmet is completely soundproofed to the Zone.

161
00:10:05.696 --> 00:10:06.864
You could blow
your vocal cords.

162
00:10:06.947 --> 00:10:08.365
and we're the only ones
that'll hear it.

163
00:10:08.449 --> 00:10:09.533
That's comforting.

164
00:10:09.617 --> 00:10:12.620
And one more trick
up your sleeve is a last resort.

165
00:10:12.703 --> 00:10:14.955
500.000 lumens.
2K throw.

166

to permanently blind.

167
00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:19.543

at close range.

168
00:10:19.627 --> 00:10:20.711
Ten-second burst.

169
00:10:22.546 --> 00:10:25.049
I will emphasize. "last resort."

170
00:10:25.132 --> 00:10:27.009
What about a close-quarters
encounter?

171
00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:30.179
We still don't know how all this holds up in actual combat.

172
00:10:30.262 --> 00:10:31.889
Oh. you want a test run?

173
00:10:31.972 --> 00:10:33.223
Don't you?

174
00:10:33.307 --> 00:10:35.809

What are you. a buck o' five?

1080
01:11:35.132 --> 01:11:37.551
How'd you drag me
all the way here?

1081
01:11:37.634 --> 01:11:38.594
Ten years in the military.

1082
01:11:38.677 --> 01:11:40.387
you pick up a few tricks
of the trade.

1083
01:11:42.681 --> 01:11:44.641
-What time?
-Just rest up for now.

1084
01:11:44.725 --> 01:11:46.476
Let the blood do its work.

1085
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.312
Come dawn. we can try
to get out of here again.

1086
01:11:48.395 --> 01:11:49.980
Choppers won't wait that long.

1087
01:11:50.063 --> 01:11:51.148
GOODMAN:
Hey. Careful. careful.

1088

[Boss grunts]

1089
01:11:52.858 --> 01:11:54.776
And listen. Goodman. We got--

1090
01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:58.322
GOODMAN:
Hey. don't touch it.
Just keep it covered.

1091
01:12:00.782 --> 01:12:03.076
That thing
didn't like you very much.

1092
01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.536
Feeling's mutual.

1093
01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:10.083
It was humanoid.

1094
01:12:11.501 --> 01:12:13.879
That was not a human.

1095
01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:14.963
We don't know that.

1096
01:12:15.047 --> 01:12:16.757
There's a lot we don't know.
isn't there?

1097
01:12:17.841 --> 01:12:20.052
Like what it is.
where it came from.

1098
01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:23.138
If there's more out there
in this D-Zone or others.

1099
01:12:24.723 --> 01:12:26.850
Beginning to think
Danner was right.

1100
01:12:28.393 --> 01:12:29.478
About what?

1101
01:12:30.687 --> 01:12:32.648
That we poisoned the world.

1102
01:12:38.528 --> 01:12:39.821
Poison.

1103
01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:53.001
That thing was about to drain
Danner.

1104
01:12:53.085 --> 01:12:54.836
but it stopped.

1105
01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.588
Stopped with you. too.

1106
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:02.844
It can't take the antigens.

1107
01:13:08.642 --> 01:13:10.519
Do you have more of these?

1108
01:13:16.191 --> 01:13:19.653
Our first plan almost worked.
We gotta trap this creature.

1109
01:13:19.736 --> 01:13:21.571
And if we can't. we kill it.

1110
01:13:21.655 --> 01:13:24.074
Okay. So. what do we know
about this thing?

1111
01:13:24.157 --> 01:13:25.242
It likes blood.

1112
01:13:25.325 --> 01:13:27.369
Not vaccinated blood.

1113
01:13:27.452 --> 01:13:29.454
Maybe it carries the virus.

1114
01:13:33.667 --> 01:13:35.919
Doesn't like light. Feels pain.

1115
01:13:37.087 --> 01:13:38.463
First thing we need to do

1116
01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:41.049
is make our guest
feel nice and welcome.

1117
01:13:41.133 --> 01:13:44.261
Lay out the scent of blood.
Draw it deep inside.

1118
01:13:45.262 --> 01:13:47.180
We need it dark in here.

1119
01:13:47.264 --> 01:13:50.559
Once it's deep enough.
we hit it.

1121
01:13:53.019 --> 01:13:55.147

Keep it open.

1123
01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.025
Its one way in is our way out.

1124
01:14:00.444 --> 01:14:01.820
We attack.

1125
01:14:01.903 --> 01:14:03.905
Trigger the trap
within the trap.

1126
01:14:03.989 --> 01:14:05.615
What if we can't kill it?

1127
01:14:05.699 --> 01:14:07.993
We leave that
to the professionals.

1128
01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:09.327
Isn't that us?

1129
01:14:10.495 --> 01:14:12.122
You take the vaccine.

1130
01:14:12.205 --> 01:14:15.208
Worst case.
I keep that thing here with me

1131
