00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:23.124
in her "Girls Want to Have Fun"
video.

1011
00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:25.460
<i>‐ I said. "Vince. I got
this guy named Dave Wolff</i>

1012
00:42:25.585 --> 00:42:27.086
<i>"that manages Cyndi Lauper.</i>

1013
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:29.088
<i>"and they just did a video
with Albano</i>

1014
00:42:29.172 --> 00:42:31.215
but now they wanna get involved
in the wrestling business."

1015
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.925
And Vince was like. "Hmm. hmm."

1016
00:42:33.009 --> 00:42:35.595
‐ Dave thought it was going
to be good for Cyndi's career.

1017
00:42:35.678 --> 00:42:37.305
You know. here she's doing
this crossover

1018
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:39.807
in this very unusual world.

1019
00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:42.393
It's like.
"What the hell is this?"

1020
00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:46.064
‐ Would you please welcome
Cyndi Lauper!

1021
00:42:46.189 --> 00:42:48.107
[crowd cheering]

1022
00:42:48.191 --> 00:42:54.280
<i>‐ So now there's all this
attention. suddenly. to WWE.</i>

1023
00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:55.990
<i>People who were fashionable.</i>

1024
00:42:56.074 --> 00:42:59.368
<i>people who were in
the rock and roll world.</i>

1025
00:42:59.494 --> 00:43:02.371
<i>they're gonna start
watching WWE.</i>

1026
00:43:02.455 --> 00:43:05.666
<i>So they had this ceremony
in Madison Square Garden.</i>

1027
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:10.671
<i>Lou Albano was one
of the primary forces</i>

1028
00:43:10.797 --> 00:43:13.758
<i>responsible for the
Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection.</i>

1029
00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:16.761
<i>and what better way
to honor a man</i>

1030
00:43:16.844 --> 00:43:18.930
<i>but to give him
a gold record?</i>

1031
00:43:19.013 --> 00:43:21.808
‐ I'm so grateful
to receive this award.

1032
00:43:21.933 --> 00:43:24.102
‐ Now that's going
to provoke some jealousy.

1033
00:43:24.185 --> 00:43:27.480
and who is the most jealous
performer of all?

1034
00:43:27.522 --> 00:43:28.856
<i>‐ There is Roddy Piper.</i>

1035
00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:30.858
‐ This is beautiful. Cyndi.

1036
00:43:30.983 --> 00:43:33.319
<i>‐ Maybe they have some kind
of presentation to make.</i>

1037
00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:35.154
‐ I want to present you
with this.

1038
00:43:36.697 --> 00:43:38.116
<i>‐ Oh! Look out!</i>

1039
00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:42.120
<i>Captain Lou Albano
clobbered!</i>

1040
00:43:42.203 --> 00:43:48.459
‐ Roddy Piper shockingly kicks
the biggest pop star in America.

1041
00:43:48.543 --> 00:43:51.712
a female pop star.
in the head.

1042
00:43:51.838 --> 00:43:54.132
<i>‐ David Wolff trying
to come to the rescue.</i>

1043
00:43:54.215 --> 00:43:56.134
<i>but he's no match!</i>

1044
00:43:56.259 --> 00:43:59.095
<i>Oh. he pile‐drived him
right down into the canvas.</i>

1045
00:43:59.178 --> 00:44:02.890
‐ 20 minutes before
the match. I was asked.

1046
00:44:02.974 --> 00:44:05.560
"Do you think you can kick
Cyndi Lauper and not hurt her?"

1047
00:44:05.685 --> 00:44:07.478
by her manager.

1048
00:44:07.562 --> 00:44:10.314
I'm thinking.
"I hope you never manage me."

1049
00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:11.482
You know?

1050
00:44:11.566 --> 00:44:14.819
<i>But when they saw that.</i>

1051
00:44:14.944 --> 00:44:18.656
uh. Saddam Hussein
got nothing on me.

1052
00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:20.074
<i>‐ Look out!</i>

1053
00:44:20.199 --> 00:44:22.827
<i>The Hulkster's
hitting the ring!</i>

1054
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.745
<i>‐ Cyndi wasn't a wrestler.</i>

1055
00:44:24.871 --> 00:44:26.873
<i>so she had to have somebody
defend her honor.</i>

1056
00:44:26.998 --> 00:44:29.458
<i>‐ He knew what he was doing.
He was stirring up the crowd</i>

1057
00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:30.918
<i>and he knew it
and he loved it.</i>

1058
00:44:31.002 --> 00:44:32.295
All heels do.

1059
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.755
<i>‐ What a disgraceful display.</i>

1060
00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:37.300
<i>Cyndi. look at her.</i>

1061
00:44:37.425 --> 00:44:39.093
<i>Tears running down her face.</i>

1062
00:44:39.177 --> 00:44:41.304
<i>Hulkster's hot.
Everybody's hot.</i>

1063
00:44:41.387 --> 00:44:45.349
<i>Boy. he wishes he could have
got his hands on Roddy Piper.</i>

1064
00:44:45.474 --> 00:44:47.101
‐ Every dog has its day.

1065
00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:48.477
you know what I'm talking
about?

1066
00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:50.313
And that one's
gonna get his.

1067
00:44:50.396 --> 00:44:53.107
‐ She expects me to sit there
and do nothing about her.

1068
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.817
so I kick her
12 yards across the field.

1069
00:44:54.942 --> 00:44:56.319
‐ But she's a woman.
She's a woman.

1070
00:44:56.444 --> 00:44:57.528
<i>‐ Just imagine it.</i>

1071
00:44:57.653 --> 00:44:59.697
<i>In about a four‐month period.</i>

1072
00:44:59.822 --> 00:45:02.825
<i>I had the kicked Cyndi Lauper
in the head.</i>

1073
00:45:02.909 --> 00:45:05.703
<i>I don't know how many guys
on Piper's Pit I had.</i>

1074
00:45:05.786 --> 00:45:08.497
<i>whatever I had done.
all in this very short time.</i>

1075
00:45:08.623 --> 00:45:11.876
<i>It was getting
really heated up.</i>

1076
00:45:11.959 --> 00:45:14.128
<i>I couldn't go anyplace.
I was fighting.</i>

1077
00:45:14.212 --> 00:45:15.671
<i>I had a family.</i>

1078
00:45:15.796 --> 00:45:17.590
<i>I was fighting
in and out of Denny's.</i>

1079
00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:19.675
<i>It was crazy.</i>

1080
00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:23.554
<i>‐ Roddy understood
that bringing in the musicians</i>

1081
00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:24.889
<i>brings it to a whole
nother level.</i>

1082
00:45:25.014 --> 00:45:26.515
<i>so he was onboard for that.</i>

1083
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:29.227
‐ All right. let me just
step out this way a tad.

1084
00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:32.605
<i>‐ But he found it very hard
being the old‐school person.</i>

1085
00:45:32.688 --> 00:45:36.484
and he tried best he could
to cooperate.

1086
00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:37.985
It was never easy.

1087
00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.030
‐ And the last one
is. "MTV stinks"?

1088
00:45:41.113 --> 00:45:43.282
<i>‐ Once we got hooked up
with MTV.</i>

1089
00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:45.117
<i>it took us to mainstream.</i>

1090
00:45:45.201 --> 00:45:46.577
‐ MTV...

Well. there's something
going on here.

1103
00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:18.651
I got to see what it is.
I got to check it out.

1104
00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:21.612
‐ Piper was
the ultimate villain.

1105
00:46:21.696 --> 00:46:23.531
so you want to have
the ultimate villain

1106
00:46:23.656 --> 00:46:25.783
<i>against the ultimate hero.</i>

1107
00:46:25.866 --> 00:46:27.493
‐ It was
the biggest thing ever.

1108
00:46:27.576 --> 00:46:29.912
It was Hogan and Piper
going at it.

1109
00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:31.831
<i>‐ We have got action.</i>

1110
00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:34.166
<i>Oh! They're at it!</i>

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:41.799
<i>‐ When I ran into Piper.</i>

1115
00:46:41.882 --> 00:46:43.926
he's the one that made
everything else possible.

1116
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:47.346
<i>‐ Oh! Dropped
the big elbow on him.</i>

1117
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.181

Without Piper.

00:47:00.026 --> 00:47:03.195
<i>‐ Piper has two confederates:</i>

1124
00:47:03.321 --> 00:47:07.116
<i>Cowboy Bob Orton. Jr.. and
Paul "Mr. Wonderful" Orndorff.</i>

1125

<i>‐ Oh. please.
‐ Look out!</i>

1127
00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:13.122
‐ They interfere in the match.

1128
00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:15.416
<i>‐ Cyndi Lauper
up on the apron.</i>

1129
00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:18.127
<i>Orndorff going around the side
rope now at Cyndi Lauper.</i>

1130
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.754
<i>‐ What? Wait a minute.
Hold on!</i>

1131
00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:21.547

<i>‐ Who was going
to save the day?</i>

1135
00:47:27.345 --> 00:47:32.058
Well. Mr. T. the biggest TV star
in the United States.

1136
00:47:32.183 --> 00:47:36.145
<i>Everybody in the country
knows Mr. T.</i>

1137
00:47:36.228 --> 00:47:38.439
<i>‐ They're inviting him
inside the ring.</i>

1138
00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:40.232
<i>‐ And so insert Mr. T.</i>

1139
00:47:40.316 --> 00:47:43.486
<i>It was Vince's way
to interject entertainment.</i>

1140
00:47:43.569 --> 00:47:44.904
It was nothing but excitement
and electricity

1141
00:47:45.029 --> 00:47:46.530
and it sure worked.

1142
00:47:46.655 --> 00:47:47.948
<i>‐ I don't know anything</i>

1143
00:47:48.032 --> 00:47:49.075
<i>about his background
as a wrestler...</i>

1144
00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:50.493
<i>‐ I used to be a bodyguard.</i>

1145
00:47:50.618 --> 00:47:51.744
I used to be a bouncer
at a disco

1146
00:47:51.827 --> 00:47:53.162
and all that stuff.

1147
00:47:53.245 --> 00:47:55.581
You know. now. I knew
how to wrestle. you know.

1148
00:47:55.664 --> 00:47:57.541
and I wasn't no fluff.

1149
00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:00.836
<i>So I stepped into the ring.
and Piper snuck up behind me.</i>

1150
00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:02.380
<i>‐ Piper nailed him
from behind.</i>

1151
00:48:02.463 --> 00:48:03.881
<i>‐ I didn't think it would
go down like that.</i>

1152
00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:05.341
<i>If I'd knew it'd go down
like that.</i>

1153
00:48:05.466 --> 00:48:06.926
<i>I would've have did
something else.</i>

1154
00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:08.302
So therefore I was so...

1155
00:48:08.386 --> 00:48:09.720
I guess I can say pissed.

1156
00:48:09.804 --> 00:48:11.680
<i>‐ All hell has broken loose.</i>

1157
00:48:11.806 --> 00:48:13.557
<i>‐ Roddy was
the ultimate bad guy.</i>

1158
00:48:13.682 --> 00:48:16.602
He sold it. He practiced it.
He was good at what he did.

1159
00:48:16.685 --> 00:48:18.646
<i>‐ We've got a madhouse here.</i>

1160
00:48:18.771 --> 00:48:20.606
<i>‐ Security holding
everyone back.</i>

1161
00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:23.275
<i>‐ And it just went‐‐it just
went berserk. you know?</i>

1162
00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:24.693
It was‐‐
[laughs]

1163
00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:26.654
I laugh at it now
'cause it's so old.

1164
00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:28.155
I think about it.
you know.

1165
00:48:28.239 --> 00:48:30.199
It reminded me
of the Keystone Cops

1166
00:48:30.282 --> 00:48:31.534
'cause everybody
was fighting.

1167
00:48:31.617 --> 00:48:33.661
<i>‐ What happened to our match?</i>

1168
00:48:33.786 --> 00:48:35.538
<i>‐ We don't have
a match anymore.</i>

1169
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:36.539
<i>It's pandemonium.</i>

1170
00:48:36.664 --> 00:48:38.082
<i>‐ Well. back then.</i>

1171
00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:39.875
<i>we were still really
protecting the business.</i>

1172
00:48:39.959 --> 00:48:41.794
"Should we tell the cops
what we're doing or not?"

1173
00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:43.587
And the standard mode was.
