and the greatest
enjoyment from life

00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:13.252
is to live dangerously."

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:17.355
He would've loved it here
on the Eastern Front.

8
00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:00.662
- Proceed. Proceed.

9
00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:34.663
- Comrade Stalin orders you!

10
00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:37.605
- Up there.

11
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.936
Get to the trench. now!

12
00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:41.406
Put them out of there. go!

13
00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:35.196
- Prepare yourselves.

14
00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:38.126
Here they come.

15
00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:02.756
- Headquarters. we
need to break out.

16
00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:04.387
We need reinforcements!

17
00:03:04.422 --> 00:03:05.790
We've been waiting
for over an hour!

18
00:03:05.826 --> 00:03:06.793
Where are they?

19
00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:11.432
- Watch out for the plane.

20
00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:12.299
- Cover.

21
00:03:18.773 --> 00:03:19.770
- Here they come.

22
00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:20.637
Fire!

23
00:03:22.005 --> 00:03:23.810
Fire!

24
00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.782
- Headquarters.
need to break out.

25
00:03:33.485 --> 00:03:35.854
- Achtung. they're
coming from the tree.

26
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.756
from the tree line.

27
00:04:05.413 --> 00:04:06.214
- Where are they?

28
00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:37.312
- You know. this reminds me
of that night in Hamburg.

29
00:04:37.348 --> 00:04:39.782
You know. the two sisters?

30
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.924
- The blondes?

31
00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:45.254
- I thought they were brunettes.

32
00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.824
We were a little drunk.

33
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.757
- Always.

34
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.227
- We wanted to build a
campfire and have Schnapps

35
00:04:51.263 --> 00:04:52.864
for the two girls we met.

36
00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:53.763
It was dark.

37
00:04:54.964 --> 00:04:59.565
Lit the campfire in the
mayor's backyard.

38
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.438
- Just your luck.

39
00:05:01.473 --> 00:05:03.773
- The luck was. he
was their father.

40
00:05:08.313 --> 00:05:09.213
- Those were good times.

41
00:05:09.248 --> 00:05:11.979
- Oh. '38 was a great year.

42
00:05:14.857 --> 00:05:16.382
- We did so much.

43
00:05:16.418 --> 00:05:17.490
- We did indeed.

44
00:05:19.525 --> 00:05:21.395
- Do you ever think
we'll make it home?

45
00:05:24.694 --> 00:05:28.633
- Yes. we will
absolutely make it home.

46
00:05:31.537 --> 00:05:33.999
20 years from now. I
will sit in my house

47
00:05:34.034 --> 00:05:38.340
in Flensburg with my
beautiful grandchildren

48
00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:39.642
and tell them stories.

49
00:05:39.677 --> 00:05:41.811
- What are you gonna
tell them about this?

50
00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:45.912
- Not a damn thing.

51
00:05:45.948 --> 00:05:49.456
I will tell them about
camaraderie. soldiering.

52
00:05:50.424 --> 00:05:52.888
the bands. the music.
and maybe the girls.

53
00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:55.825
I'm not telling them a damn
thing about the Russians.

54
00:05:56.693 --> 00:05:57.992
- So you're going
to lie to them?

55
00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:01.166
- Yes.

56
00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:02.365
I don't think they'll appreciate

57
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.001
the truth of this. do you. Daug?

58
00:06:05.036 --> 00:06:05.868
- No.

59
00:06:07.405 --> 00:06:09.773
I know I wouldn't want to.

60
00:06:26.894 --> 00:06:27.721
- Captain.

61
00:06:27.757 --> 00:06:29.556
- What
the hell is that?

62
00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:30.860
- Goliath.

63
00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:32.798
- Morning. Sergeant.

64
00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:33.794
- Captain.

65
00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:35.460
- They brought them
in this morning.

66
00:06:35.496 --> 00:06:36.297
Worthless.

67
00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:37.135
- Good luck.

68
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.999
- Thank you.

69
00:06:45.013 --> 00:06:45.875
- What are you doing?

70
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.250
- I thought it was
time for a cigarette.

71
00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:52.079
- You know how bad
those are for you?

72
00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:54.814
- You're probably right.

73
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.951
- They haven't
done him any good.

74
00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.520
- They keep sending us
people like Steinbeck.

75
00:06:59.555 --> 00:07:00.824
what are we gonna do?

76
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:02.892
- Get ready for
the next quarter.

77
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.400
- Good
morning. doctor.

78
00:07:13.436 --> 00:07:14.868
- Good morning.

79
00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:16.370
- How
are you holding up?

80
00:07:16.406 --> 00:07:17.640
- Not very good.

81
00:07:17.675 --> 00:07:19.739
- How many did you
lose this morning?

82
00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.174
- Do you really want to know?

83
00:07:25.052 --> 00:07:26.916
- No. not really.

84
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.421
- Look how young they are.

85
00:07:30.457 --> 00:07:32.152
They're getting
younger every day.

86
00:07:34.963 --> 00:07:36.290
- I understand.

87
00:07:36.325 --> 00:07:37.157
- 16.

88
00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:42.563
- High Command say there's
a relief column on the way.

89
00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:43.933
- I've heard this before.

90
00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:48.971
- They should break in this
morning. tonight. tomorrow.

91
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:52.271
- I don't think we're
gonna hold out that long.

92
00:07:54.977 --> 00:07:57.177
- I will get you out
of here. I promise.

93
00:07:58.185 --> 00:07:59.619
- I hope so.

94
00:08:04.486 --> 00:08:05.284
- Excuse me.

95
00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:17.036
Now. what did you
promise mother not to do?

96
00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:18.664
- Not to get shot.

97
00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:19.499
- What did you do?

98
00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:20.574
- I got shot.

99
00:08:21.938 --> 00:08:24.108
You know. you always
say girls love scars.

100
00:08:24.143 --> 00:08:25.205
So I did it.

101
00:08:26.173 --> 00:08:27.474
- I'm never gonna
hear the end of this.

102
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.307
- You know it.

103
00:08:31.813 --> 00:08:33.620
So are we still winning the war?

104
00:08:34.617 --> 00:08:35.681
- Oh. most gloriously.

105
00:08:35.717 --> 00:08:36.953
Haven't you noticed?

106
00:08:37.821 --> 00:08:40.759
- So the noise I
hear. it's not ours?

107
00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.996
- Nope. but they have promised
to break us out any moment.

108
00:08:55.373 --> 00:08:56.803
- You know what?

109
00:08:56.838 --> 00:08:58.645
If the Russians comes closer.

110
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.948
I'm gonna pack up the nurse
and crawl out of here.

111
00:09:01.984 --> 00:09:03.144
trust me Klaus.

112
00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:06.113
- You find a nurse around
here. I'll crawl with you.

113
00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:09.018
- I guess you don't come
to the rear much. do you?

114
00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:11.251
We have one right there.

115
00:09:16.161 --> 00:09:17.026
- What?

116
00:09:19.662 --> 00:09:21.261
- Son. can you hear me?

117
00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:23.500
- What the hell
is she doing here?

118
00:09:23.535 --> 00:09:25.097
What is a woman doing here?

119
00:09:25.133 --> 00:09:28.341
- Well. well. she
was a radio operator

120
00:09:28.377 --> 00:09:30.972
and she had some
medical training.

121
00:09:31.008 --> 00:09:34.212
so she decided to stay
when the trains left.

122
00:09:34.248 --> 00:09:35.845
That was a week ago.

123
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.083
- You know what the
Russians will do to her?

124
00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:39.614
- Yeah. we know.

125
00:09:39.649 --> 00:09:41.382
I know. and she does.

126
00:09:41.417 --> 00:09:42.249
- Shit.

127
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.490
- Captain. you look tired.

128
00:09:49.526 --> 00:09:50.726
Are you well?

129
00:09:50.762 --> 00:09:52.060
- Well the captain
is always tired.

130
00:09:52.096 --> 00:09:53.500
but you know. he's very
surprised to see you here.

131
00:09:53.535 --> 00:09:55.030
- Someone had to take
care of the wounded.

132
00:09:55.065 --> 00:09:57.262
There's a small sacrifice
for my country so--

133
00:09:57.298 --> 00:10:00.370
- Please don't give me
the Fatherland speech.

134
00:10:00.406 --> 00:10:01.708
not here in Russia.

135
00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:04.673
How long have you been here?

136
00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:06.304
- I volunteered seven weeks ago.

137
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.878
- Do you have any idea
what will happen to you

138
00:10:08.913 --> 00:10:11.347
if the Russians break
through our lines?

139
00:10:11.383 --> 00:10:12.283
- I am aware.

140
00:10:12.319 --> 00:10:14.087
- Klaus. she's here.

141
00:10:14.122 --> 00:10:15.117
Just get her out.

142
00:10:18.127 --> 00:10:19.558
- What's your name?

143
00:10:19.593 --> 00:10:21.662
- My name is Gudrun
Herr Captain.

144
00:10:23.298 --> 00:10:24.460
- Where are you from. Gudrun?

145
00:10:24.496 --> 00:10:26.398
- I am from Berlin.

146
00:10:26.433 --> 00:10:28.064
Look. I appreciate your concern.

147
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.298
I insist you let me stay to
take care of the wounded.

148
00:10:32.739 --> 00:10:35.274
- Gudrun. I don't
know if you're aware.

149
00:10:35.309 --> 00:10:36.974
but we are surrounded.

150
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:40.074
I could not send you
anywhere. even if I wanted to.

151
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.848
We have 30 kilometers
to our closest lines.

152
00:10:43.817 --> 00:10:44.913
You should never have
been here in the first--

153
00:10:44.948 --> 00:10:47.551
- Captain. my brother
was surrounded

154
00:10:47.586 --> 00:10:49.654
in Stalingrad for four months.

155
00:10:49.689 --> 00:10:50.985
A Russian shell
took both his legs.

156
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.091
but he made it out
on the last plane.

157
00:10:54.126 --> 00:10:57.126
Ever since he recovered. he's
been trying to make it back.

158
00:10:58.262 --> 00:11:02.901
- Gudrun. you were assigned
as a radio operator. yes?

159
00:11:02.936 --> 00:11:06.239
- Yes. I was assigned to
General Schroder's headquarters.

160
00:11:06.275 --> 00:11:07.299
And I also have medical--

161
00:11:07.335 --> 00:11:09.542
- So you have knowledge
of all our radio codes.

162
00:11:09.577 --> 00:11:11.778
transmission.
deciphering of messages?

163
00:11:13.476 --> 00:11:14.242
- Yes.

164
00:11:15.242 --> 00:11:19.313
- Klaus. who's
coming to get us out?

165
00:11:20.489 --> 00:11:22.115
- They put together
a battle group.

166
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.887
It says Michael
Wittmann is to lead it.

167
00:11:24.922 --> 00:11:26.224
- Then
we'll be just fine.

168
00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:27.519
- Take this.

169
00:11:27.555 --> 00:11:30.758
- I'm sorry. Captain. but
I could never shoot anyone.

170
00:11:30.793 --> 00:11:32.090
- It's not for anyone.

171
00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:34.329
The last bullet is for yourself.

172
00:11:34.364 --> 00:11:37.637
The Russians break through
our lines. you'll die anyway.

173
00:11:37.672 --> 00:11:40.037
This way it'll be faster
and more merciful.

174
00:11:46.478 --> 00:11:47.308
This is not good.

175
00:11:50.011 --> 00:11:52.579
Listen. you can still shoot?

176
00:11:52.614 --> 00:11:53.446
- Yeah.

177
00:11:55.654 --> 00:11:57.252
- If the Russians break through.

178
00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:01.058
don't let them take her alive.

179
00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:05.392
You know what they'll do.

180
00:12:07.202 --> 00:12:09.000
- Yeah. I know.

181
00:12:11.369 --> 00:12:12.201
- Shit.

182
00:12:12.934 --> 00:12:14.808
I'll get us out of here.

183
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.859
- Can you hear me?

184
00:12:41.064 --> 00:12:43.064
In the name of
the German people.

185
00:12:43.099 --> 00:12:45.839
I award you the Wound
Badge in silver.

186
00:12:50.037 --> 00:12:51.240
Congratulations. my son.

187
00:12:53.414 --> 00:12:54.243
You're a brave man.

188
00:13:00.287 --> 00:13:01.250
- Doctor.

189
00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:05.958
What the hell is the
nurse doing here?

190
00:13:07.262 --> 00:13:08.088
- There's a nurse?

191
00:13:08.124 --> 00:13:09.395
- There's a nurse
over with Anton.

192
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:10.663
Why wasn't she pulled out?

193
00:13:10.698 --> 00:13:11.863
- I need all the
fucking help I can get.

194
00:13:11.898 --> 00:13:13.260
- You should have put
her on the trains.

195
00:13:13.295 --> 00:13:14.934
- She volunteered.
- Do you have any idea

196
00:13:14.969 --> 00:13:15.630
what they'll do to her?
- You know what the Russians

197
00:13:15.666 --> 00:13:16.731
will do to her.

198
00:13:16.767 --> 00:13:17.901
- She's doing it for

199
00:13:17.936 --> 00:13:18.798
the Fatherland.
- They rape thousands

200
00:13:18.833 --> 00:13:20.034
over there.

201
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.201
- Oh. please with
the Fatherland.

202
00:13:21.237 --> 00:13:22.570
- Yeah. but tell the
Fuhrer that. huh?

203
00:13:22.606 --> 00:13:23.437
- Damn it.

204
00:13:25.776 --> 00:13:26.944
- Don't you understand?

205
00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:28.476
I need the fucking
help here. all right?

206
00:13:28.511 --> 00:13:31.311
- I understand. but I'm not
letting this happen on my watch.

207
00:13:31.346 --> 00:13:33.918
- Like I don't have
enough to worry about.

208
00:13:33.953 --> 00:13:36.255
We've lost too many
good men and women.

209
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.217
- I under--

210
00:13:37.252 --> 00:13:38.483
- Yeah. here's another
one right here.

211
00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:39.854
- Damn it. we're gonna
send you some guards.

212
00:13:39.889 --> 00:13:41.222
I'll find you two men

213
00:13:41.257 --> 00:13:42.461
to set up here.
- I got no one else left.

214
00:13:42.497 --> 00:13:44.394
- We'll have to find some.

215
00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:45.824
Come on.

216
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.900
Good luck.

217
00:13:48.129 --> 00:13:49.628
- God. I hate this place.

218
00:13:56.511 --> 00:13:58.342
- Good morning. Steinbeck.

219
00:13:58.378 --> 00:13:59.710
- Captain.

220
00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:01.445
- We have a little problem.

221
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:02.413
- Another one?

222
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:03.279
- Another one.

223
00:14:04.282 --> 00:14:06.882
One of the nurses got
left behind by the trains.

224
00:14:06.917 --> 00:14:09.254
She's at the field hospital.

225
00:14:09.289 --> 00:14:10.017
- I see.

226
00:14:10.052 --> 00:14:11.419
- Go watch over them. please.

227
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:13.589
- Yes. sir.

228
00:14:13.624 --> 00:14:14.455
- Thank you.

229
00:14:26.771 --> 00:14:27.738
- See that it is done.

230
00:14:27.774 --> 00:14:29.406
The Motherland's
counting on you.

231
00:14:29.442 --> 00:14:30.474
Good luck.

232
00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:31.340
- Good luck.

233
00:14:57.506 --> 00:14:58.769
- Are you ready to attack?

234
00:14:59.772 --> 00:15:01.406
- The Germans are surrounded.

235
00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:02.168
Kill them all.

236
00:15:02.203 --> 00:15:04.208
- Kill the fascist invaders. go.

237
00:15:15.285 --> 00:15:17.716
- Lieutenant. how
are you holding up?

238
00:15:20.427 --> 00:15:21.491
- I'm okay.

239
00:15:21.526 --> 00:15:22.358
- Yeah.

240
00:15:26.367 --> 00:15:27.198
I'm scared.

241
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:31.169
- Oh. it would be all right.

242
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.403
Klaus is gonna
get us outta here.

243
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.506
- Right?

244
00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:37.640
Right.

245
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.528
- Come with me

246
00:16:30.564 --> 00:16:31.892
Come with me.

247
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.070
- Klaus.

248
00:17:16.709 --> 00:17:17.671
Klaus. Klaus.

249
00:17:21.649 --> 00:17:22.742
Russians in the woods.

250
00:17:24.213 --> 00:17:26.082
- Get back to the trench.

251
00:17:26.118 --> 00:17:28.118
Turn the anti-tank
cannon around.

252
00:17:28.153 --> 00:17:30.090
They're coming from
the other side.

253
00:17:37.798 --> 00:17:39.858
- Position two reporting.

254
00:17:42.398 --> 00:17:44.263
Position two report.

255
00:17:44.298 --> 00:17:46.168
- We are coming. copy.

256
00:18:27.879 --> 00:18:29.578
- Go to the right.

257
00:19:10.323 --> 00:19:14.326
- The Russians are
fighting us from the woods.

258
00:19:21.768 --> 00:19:22.800
- Fire.

259
00:22:20.914 --> 00:22:21.810
- Hello. yeah.

260
00:22:25.685 --> 00:22:28.751
- Wittmann here. I have a
stand by the field hospital.

261
00:22:29.753 --> 00:22:32.788
we have plenty of fuel
here. Wittmann's out.

262
00:22:34.028 --> 00:22:35.824
We have to get our comrades out.

263
00:22:37.963 --> 00:22:38.996
- Unretreat.

264
00:22:39.032 --> 00:22:40.565
Come on. move. move.

265
00:22:41.362 --> 00:22:42.402
- Yes sir.

266
00:22:43.867 --> 00:22:47.171
- Our friends are getting
overrun by the Russians.

267
00:22:47.206 --> 00:22:48.202
- Everybody moves up?

268
00:22:48.238 --> 00:22:49.772
- No.

269
00:22:56.915 --> 00:22:58.278
- Up. up

270
00:23:36.089 --> 00:23:37.856
- How many did we lose?

271
00:23:37.892 --> 00:23:38.887
- At least five.

272
00:23:39.993 --> 00:23:40.823
Is that Ronald?

273
00:23:41.962 --> 00:23:42.792
- That's Herman.

274
00:23:44.031 --> 00:23:44.893
- What's left of him?

275
00:23:47.534 --> 00:23:49.898
- How we holding up on
ammunition and water?

276
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.700
- Ammunition. food.
bullets. water. all gone.

277
00:23:55.736 --> 00:23:57.004
maybe enough for tonight.

278
00:23:58.006 --> 00:24:00.840
- I'm sure they'll get
us out any moment now.

279
00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:01.879
- You know what
I've been thinking?

280
00:24:01.914 --> 00:24:03.180
- What?

281
00:24:03.215 --> 00:24:06.182
- Leave back to Hamburg.

282
00:24:06.217 --> 00:24:08.083
Start my own bar.

283
00:24:08.118 --> 00:24:08.846
- Oh.

284
00:24:08.881 --> 00:24:10.251
- You know. be my own beer bar.

285
00:24:10.286 --> 00:24:11.087
- Bar maids.

286
00:24:11.122 --> 00:24:11.816
- Of course.

287
00:24:11.851 --> 00:24:12.921
- I like the way you think.

288
00:24:14.057 --> 00:24:17.926
When were you planning on
this momentous change of life?

289
00:24:21.761 --> 00:24:23.162
- Is noon tomorrow okay?

290
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.898
- That's a very short notice.

291
00:24:25.933 --> 00:24:27.365
I'm not sure the
Führer will like it.

292
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.268
- I was hoping my commanding
officer can tell him for me.

293
00:24:31.479 --> 00:24:32.775
- You know. it's funny
you should mention it.

294
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:35.575
I'm seeing him for tea
and coffee in a few days.

295
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:36.877
I'll tell him in person.

296
00:24:36.912 --> 00:24:39.011
these things are best
heard from a friend.

297
00:24:39.046 --> 00:24:41.019
- It's good to have
friends in high places.

298
00:24:41.055 --> 00:24:42.054
I'm glad I met you.

299
00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:42.951
- That's why I'm here.

300
00:24:44.888 --> 00:24:48.093
So you aren't planning
on a military discount

301
00:24:48.129 --> 00:24:49.795
in this bar of yours. yes?

302
00:24:49.831 --> 00:24:50.925
- For you?

303
00:24:51.027 --> 00:24:53.599
You never pay anyway. I
carried you for four years now.

304
00:24:54.534 --> 00:24:56.134
- You break my heart.
there's no respect

305
00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.102
for a commanding officer.

306
00:24:57.137 --> 00:24:58.499
- But I'm here for you.

307
00:24:58.534 --> 00:25:00.071
- So are the Russians.

308
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.175

we ain't ready for war
right now. where are they?

310

trees. from the tree line.

00:25:43.082 --> 00:25:43.913
Steinberg.

312
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.141

- Hold.

- We have to go to the right.

323
00:29:44.458 --> 00:29:46.056
- Keep an eye on your flank.

324
00:29:56.264 --> 00:30:00.438
- We've got too many
wounded soldiers left.

325
00:30:00.474 --> 00:30:01.407

362
00:38:01.614 --> 00:38:02.954
- Like we're gonna save your ass

363
00:38:02.989 --> 00:38:04.684
when we show up off the beach.

364
00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.389
- Yeah. like when I'm
gonna come up behind you

365
00:38:06.424 --> 00:38:08.758
and get that German
that's gonna plug you.

366
00:38:08.793 --> 00:38:10.822
- Hey. listen to all
seriousness. y'all
keep your head down

367
00:38:10.857 --> 00:38:13.359
and be safe. we'll
see you on the beach.

368
00:38:13.394 --> 00:38:14.561
- See you on the beach.

369
00:38:14.596 --> 00:38:15.894
- See you on the
beach .

370
00:38:15.996 --> 00:38:18.535
- See you on the beach.
private. Keep your head down.

371
00:38:21.205 --> 00:38:22.672
- Keep your ass down too.

372
00:38:22.707 --> 00:38:27.676
they'll shoot you there before
they shoot you in the head.

373
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:18.749
- What wonder witness is.
the war is lost anyway.

374
00:40:18.784 --> 00:40:20.220
- Ulli. are you serious feel.

375
00:40:20.255 --> 00:40:21.152
- Seriously.

376
00:40:22.293 --> 00:40:24.625
- Ulli. don't be so pessimistic.

377
00:40:35.739 --> 00:40:37.468
- Why are you hiding
things from the Führer.

378
00:40:37.504 --> 00:40:38.439
- No we are not.

379
00:40:38.474 --> 00:40:40.136
- It is a heart attack with you.

380
00:40:40.172 --> 00:40:42.806
- I know what you're
hiding from the Führer.

381
00:40:42.841 --> 00:40:43.948
- Good to see you again Captain.

382
00:40:43.983 --> 00:40:44.980
- Let's be honest.

383
00:40:45.015 --> 00:40:45.842
- Yeah.

384
00:40:45.877 --> 00:40:47.110
- We're all hiding something.

385
00:40:47.146 --> 00:40:49.316
- How many pregnancies
have you left to France.

386
00:40:49.351 --> 00:40:51.385
- Will. tell him.

387
00:40:51.421 --> 00:40:55.689
- Not that many. come on.

388
00:40:55.725 --> 00:40:57.226
- On your salary.
you can afford them.

389
00:40:57.262 --> 00:40:58.728
- Yeah. that's the thing.

390
00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:03.027
I just use another name.
You know. it usually works.

391
00:41:03.063 --> 00:41:04.533
- Don't use my name. I
can't afford it either.

392
00:41:04.569 --> 00:41:05.968
- Oh. you it's over
with that earlier?

393
00:41:06.003 --> 00:41:06.730
Yeah.

394
00:41:06.765 --> 00:41:08.071
- You've holes in you.

395
00:41:08.106 --> 00:41:09.137
- You like to see.

396
00:41:11.944 --> 00:41:12.742
- Captain.

397
00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.211
- So. now it's down to
important army business.

398
00:41:18.246 --> 00:41:19.481
- Yes.

399
00:41:19.517 --> 00:41:20.714
- I know you were
here before me.

400
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:25.119
So you must know the
best bar in town.

401
00:41:25.154 --> 00:41:26.023
- Yeah.

402
00:41:26.058 --> 00:41:26.954
- Don't tell him.

403
00:41:27.786 --> 00:41:28.959
- Does he deserve it?

404
00:41:28.995 --> 00:41:29.687
I don't know.

405
00:41:29.723 --> 00:41:30.855
- Remember the last time.

406
00:41:30.891 --> 00:41:32.296
we don't want that
to happen again.

407
00:41:32.332 --> 00:41:33.558
- Don't make me
demote you again.

408
00:41:33.593 --> 00:41:34.797
- Let's negotiate.

409
00:41:35.696 --> 00:41:37.830
The first five rounds are in you

410
00:41:37.865 --> 00:41:40.404
and we'll show you
where it is. okay?

411
00:41:40.439 --> 00:41:41.831
- After a year of
the Russian front.

412
00:41:41.867 --> 00:41:43.603
I haven't seen many bars.

413
00:41:43.638 --> 00:41:45.008
It's a deal. on me.

414
00:41:45.043 --> 00:41:45.973
- Done deal.

415
00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:48.305
- All right.

416
00:41:58.057 --> 00:41:59.990
- I'm sure it is.

417
00:42:06.793 --> 00:42:08.229
- Excuse me. the field hospital.

418
00:42:08.265 --> 00:42:09.065
- It's that way.

419
00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.296
- This way?

420
00:42:10.331 --> 00:42:11.133
- Yes.

421
00:42:11.168 --> 00:42:12.036
- Thank you.

422
00:42:27.949 --> 00:42:31.018
- Yep. we're gonna
bring him down this way.

423
00:42:34.225 --> 00:42:35.658
- Yeah. okay.

424
00:42:35.694 --> 00:42:37.954
- And I'm sure you've
noticed the readiness

425
00:42:37.989 --> 00:42:40.298
of our forces here in Normandy.

426
00:42:40.334 --> 00:42:43.234
- They do seem
rather unprepared.

427
00:42:43.269 --> 00:42:45.536
- My God. half the men here

428
00:42:45.571 --> 00:42:50.774
are either Russian.
Ukrainian. or Polish.

429
00:42:51.742 --> 00:42:52.972
They'll scatter like
flies in the wind

430
00:42:53.008 --> 00:42:55.006
at the very first sign
of approaching danger.

431
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:57.945
I want you to inspect
our defense here

432
00:42:57.981 --> 00:43:01.081
and give me a report on
how they can be improved.

433
00:43:02.249 --> 00:43:04.722
- I will be honored to
help in any way that I can.

434
00:43:06.025 --> 00:43:06.617
- Gentlemen.

435
00:43:06.652 --> 00:43:07.692
- Hi Hitler.

436
00:43:09.326 --> 00:43:10.156
- Field Marshall.

437
00:43:11.528 --> 00:43:13.126
I have seen information for you.

438
00:43:14.665 --> 00:43:16.996
- You always have
something for me.

439
00:43:17.032 --> 00:43:20.934
but it never seems to
be anything I can use.

440
00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:23.868
- Captain. General
Frank's here will show you

441
00:43:23.903 --> 00:43:25.402
the layout of the countryside.

442
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.076
- What's up gentlemen.

443
00:44:11.992 --> 00:44:12.583
- Morning.

444
00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:13.417
- Morning.

445
00:44:14.525 --> 00:44:16.789
So what do you think Klaus?

446
00:44:16.824 --> 00:44:18.125
- I think it looks like hell.

447
00:44:18.993 --> 00:44:20.124
We don't have
enough of anything.

448
00:44:20.159 --> 00:44:21.197
How are we gonna
hold the allies back?

449
00:44:21.233 --> 00:44:22.597
We have nothing.

450
00:44:22.632 --> 00:44:24.131
- We have mindless optimism.

451
00:44:24.967 --> 00:44:27.331
- Found a way to shoot
that out of a gun.

452
00:44:27.367 --> 00:44:30.302
- Any day now. our
scientists are working on it.

453
00:45:12.647 --> 00:45:13.752
- Hey. wake up.

454
00:45:14.715 --> 00:45:16.183
Mines my friend.

455
00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:19.554
It better be important.
I just finished my watch.

456
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:20.390
- But it's important.

457
00:45:20.425 --> 00:45:21.620
- What is the problem?

458
00:45:21.655 --> 00:45:22.824
- It's Ulli.

459
00:45:22.859 --> 00:45:25.394
- Ulli. what the
hell did he do now?

460
00:45:25.429 --> 00:45:26.393
- He's gone again.

461
00:45:26.428 --> 00:45:27.229
- Gone?

462
00:45:27.264 --> 00:45:28.363
- Yeah.

463
00:45:28.399 --> 00:45:29.198
- For how long?

464
00:45:29.234 --> 00:45:30.060
- No idea.

465
00:45:30.095 --> 00:45:32.165
- And what do we do about it?

466
00:45:32.201 --> 00:45:34.305
- You go to town. ask
some just good questions.

467
00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.673
And I'll go tell Klaus.

468
00:45:35.708 --> 00:45:37.470
- It better not be
the resistance again.

469
00:45:37.505 --> 00:45:38.308
- Yeah.

470
00:45:38.344 --> 00:45:39.305
Or the MPs got him.

471
00:45:40.345 --> 00:45:41.241
- I'll go to town.

472
00:45:52.092 --> 00:45:53.354
- Morning.

473
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:54.221
- Morning.

474
00:45:58.357 --> 00:46:01.563
- Year and a half on
the Eastern Front.

475
00:46:01.598 --> 00:46:03.063
I've never seen an egg.

476
00:46:03.099 --> 00:46:05.462
If I wanted the eggs I'd
have to lay it myself.

477
00:46:05.498 --> 00:46:08.097
Or steal it from some
pissed off Russian farmer.

478
00:46:08.133 --> 00:46:10.237
Life in France. it's good.

479
00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:12.408
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

480
00:46:12.443 --> 00:46:13.708
We appreciate it.

481
00:46:13.743 --> 00:46:15.506
It's an enjoyable time here.

482
00:46:17.981 --> 00:46:20.318
- If I could. I would
send this breakfast

483
00:46:20.353 --> 00:46:22.417
to everybody in Russia.

484
00:46:22.453 --> 00:46:23.354
They deserve it.

485
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:24.856
- Always a good way Klaus.

486
00:46:25.755 --> 00:46:28.026
- Well. when I had my share.

487
00:46:28.061 --> 00:46:28.655
- Yeah.

488
00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:29.491
- What's going on?

489
00:46:29.527 --> 00:46:31.225
- We have a problem.

490
00:46:32.762 --> 00:46:34.263
- Are the Americans here?

491
00:46:34.298 --> 00:46:35.262
- Nope.

492
00:46:36.369 --> 00:46:37.398
- Are the Russians here?

493
00:46:37.433 --> 00:46:38.265
- Nope.

494
00:46:39.097 --> 00:46:40.300
- involved.

495
00:46:41.306 --> 00:46:42.269
- Not yet.

496
00:46:44.342 --> 00:46:45.473
- That bad?

497
00:46:45.509 --> 00:46:46.339
- It might be.

498
00:46:47.876 --> 00:46:49.642
- All right. what's going on?

499
00:46:49.677 --> 00:46:50.508
- It's Ulli.

500
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.148
- What the hell did he do now?

501
00:46:53.183 --> 00:46:56.250
Did he get drunk again and
piss on the General's car?

502
00:46:56.884 --> 00:46:58.586
- That was a good one.

503
00:46:58.622 --> 00:46:59.723
That would be nice.

504
00:46:59.758 --> 00:47:02.157
No. he's been
missing two days now.

505
00:47:04.056 --> 00:47:05.193
- Anybody reported?

506
00:47:06.496 --> 00:47:07.294
- Not yet.

507
00:47:10.835 --> 00:47:13.632
It's a matter of
tough time though.

508
00:47:13.667 --> 00:47:14.499
- Shit.

509
00:47:16.168 --> 00:47:18.142
He just can't help it. can he?

510
00:47:18.177 --> 00:47:19.009
- No.

511
00:47:20.975 --> 00:47:23.310
- I'd just go look for him.

512
00:48:36.522 --> 00:48:37.547
- Are there maneuvers?

513
00:48:37.582 --> 00:48:39.621
- No. the resistance
has been very active

514
00:48:39.657 --> 00:48:41.392
the last few weeks.

515
00:48:52.968 --> 00:48:54.933
- Just the past few weeks?

516
00:49:02.009 --> 00:49:03.377
- Let's get out of here.

517
00:49:33.338 --> 00:49:34.542
- Is Captain Miller here?

518
00:49:34.577 --> 00:49:35.445
- Yes.

519
00:49:35.481 --> 00:49:36.608
Just over there.

520
00:49:38.051 --> 00:49:40.447
- Captain Miller. I have
a order for Gerald Frank.

521
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:42.581
I'm sorry.

522
00:51:00.327 --> 00:51:03.101
- So you got the
orders to do it.

523
00:51:07.032 --> 00:51:07.864
- Yeah.

524
00:51:09.075 --> 00:51:12.770
The general thought it
was best if I did it.

525
00:51:19.352 --> 00:51:20.151
- Yeah.

526
00:51:21.686 --> 00:51:22.917
Well that's good.

527
00:51:22.953 --> 00:51:24.452
It's better with a friend.

528
00:51:30.927 --> 00:51:32.658
- I have to ask. why?

529
00:51:42.472 --> 00:51:45.374
- I just had enough of
this whole thing. you know?

530
00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:49.840
And I met this girl.

531
00:51:51.517 --> 00:51:52.315
- A girl.

532
00:51:53.586 --> 00:51:54.581
- Classic story.

533
00:51:58.622 --> 00:51:59.784
Yeah.

534
00:51:59.819 --> 00:52:01.619
I mean. why else do men do
the stupid things men do?

535
00:52:01.654 --> 00:52:04.894
I mean. sometimes I
think the war started

536
00:52:04.929 --> 00:52:06.527
because of a girl involved.

537
00:52:08.031 --> 00:52:08.993
- It wouldn't be the first time.

538
00:52:09.028 --> 00:52:09.827
- No.

539
00:52:11.637 --> 00:52:12.467
Hellen of Troy.

540
00:52:14.133 --> 00:52:15.173
- For a one.

541
00:52:22.708 --> 00:52:26.313
So you think this
whole thing started

542
00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:31.552
just because Hitler.
Churchill. Stalin.

543
00:52:32.454 --> 00:52:35.355
They all just show
after their girlfriends.

544
00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:37.423
- Well. it did make
sense. doesn't it?

545
00:52:37.458 --> 00:52:40.627
I mean. stupid men
do stupid things.

546
00:52:42.096 --> 00:52:42.959
And that's it.

547
00:52:44.595 --> 00:52:47.601
- This is getting pretty stupid.

548
00:52:49.536 --> 00:52:50.767
- Yeah. I know
some of those guys.

549
00:52:50.803 --> 00:52:52.709
I mean. they could just
have sent them flowers

550
00:52:52.745 --> 00:52:54.677
and let that be it.

551
00:52:54.713 --> 00:52:55.813
Make it easy.

552
00:52:55.848 --> 00:52:56.876
- Flowers would've been good.

553
00:52:56.911 --> 00:52:58.115
- Yeah.

554
00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:00.545
I mean. that's how it
started. wasn't it?

555
00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:02.750
I mean. do you
remember Sudetenland?

556
00:53:02.785 --> 00:53:03.650
- Yeah.

557
00:53:05.151 --> 00:53:06.991
Austria too.

558
00:53:07.026 --> 00:53:09.493
Everybody threw
flowers at us then.

559
00:53:09.528 --> 00:53:10.360
- Yeah.

560
00:53:12.696 --> 00:53:13.556
Yeah.

561
00:53:13.591 --> 00:53:15.365
Well that suddenly changed.

562
00:53:20.671 --> 00:53:21.437
- Yeah.

563
00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.950
Sit down. sit down.

564
00:53:37.986 --> 00:53:38.820
- Captain.

565
00:53:38.856 --> 00:53:39.953
- Good morning.

566
00:53:39.989 --> 00:53:40.791
- Good morning.

567
00:53:40.826 --> 00:53:41.823
- Good morning Captain.

568
00:53:41.859 --> 00:53:42.452
- Good morning.

569
00:53:42.487 --> 00:53:43.824
- We got some coffee.

570
00:53:43.859 --> 00:53:44.587
- Yep.

571
00:53:44.622 --> 00:53:46.561
- Yuri. coffee for the captain.

572
00:53:48.361 --> 00:53:49.766
- Where was Yuri from?

573
00:53:49.801 --> 00:53:51.302
- Poland. I think.

574
00:53:52.199 --> 00:53:52.999
- I don't know.

575
00:53:53.035 --> 00:53:54.497
- I'm not sure.

576
00:53:54.533 --> 00:53:56.071
- Big one world of German.

577
00:53:56.106 --> 00:53:58.304
Well. it could be from Ukraine.

578
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.548
- Thank you. thank you.

579
00:54:09.018 --> 00:54:09.980
- Eastern Poland.

580
00:54:12.124 --> 00:54:14.754
And how do you all
can communicate?

581
00:54:16.862 --> 00:54:19.262
- You make it work.

582
00:54:19.298 --> 00:54:22.598
- And how do you make
it work during battle?

583
00:54:22.633 --> 00:54:26.166
- Well. we try not to let him
too close with the weapons.

584
00:54:26.201 --> 00:54:27.802
He's a Ruski after all.

585
00:54:27.837 --> 00:54:28.839
- Ruski.

586
00:54:28.874 --> 00:54:29.632
- Yeah. you're Ruski.

587
00:54:29.667 --> 00:54:31.169
- Why you all call me Ruski huh?

588
00:54:31.205 --> 00:54:32.338
- You're Ruski.

589
00:54:32.373 --> 00:54:34.711
- I hate Ruski. they're pigs.

590
00:54:34.747 --> 00:54:35.877
I'm a Prussian.

591
00:54:35.913 --> 00:54:36.779
- Yes. you are.

592
00:54:36.814 --> 00:54:37.744
Goddamn it.

593
00:54:40.181 --> 00:54:41.011
What's so funny?

594
00:54:42.284 --> 00:54:43.816
- I have something to tell you.

595
00:54:47.659 --> 00:54:48.491
Ulli.

596
00:54:49.223 --> 00:54:50.658
- What is that?

597
00:54:51.358 --> 00:54:52.830
Oh. they found him?

598
00:54:52.865 --> 00:54:54.464
- Yes. they found him.

599
00:55:03.369 --> 00:55:04.408
- When Captain?

600
00:55:07.242 --> 00:55:08.412
- Tomorrow morning.

601
00:55:11.179 --> 00:55:12.081
- Yeah. right.

602
00:55:15.217 --> 00:55:16.281
- You're a good man.

603
00:55:16.317 --> 00:55:17.784
For a good solution.

604
00:55:20.859 --> 00:55:21.788
Drink. drink.

605
00:55:26.561 --> 00:55:28.663
- Spending all
the time together.

606
00:55:30.763 --> 00:55:32.799
- It's to good
men in the ground.

607
00:55:33.837 --> 00:55:35.398
- Yeah.

608
00:55:35.433 --> 00:55:36.638
Another one.

609
00:55:37.975 --> 00:55:39.039
- Another one.

610
00:55:39.075 --> 00:55:40.444
- Another one.

611
00:55:44.676 --> 00:55:46.516
- Go see him in the prison.

612
00:55:48.052 --> 00:55:49.852
He's over there now.

613
00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:50.718
Bring some wine.

614
00:56:19.879 --> 00:56:21.513
- So have you seen
any vulgares around?

615
00:56:21.548 --> 00:56:23.850
- Still thinking about women.

616
00:56:24.984 --> 00:56:27.518
- You still think they'd
nag you like women do.

617
00:56:27.553 --> 00:56:29.526
- Yeah. especially you.

618
00:56:46.208 --> 00:56:47.707
Want a cigarette?

619
00:56:47.742 --> 00:56:49.942
- No thanks. those
things will kill you.

620
00:56:52.815 --> 00:56:54.881
- You know. you're starting
to sound like my mother.

621
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.181
- Well. so should be.

622
00:57:00.693 --> 00:57:01.492
- Yep.

623
00:57:15.304 --> 00:57:16.573
- I'm scared as shit.

624
00:57:18.871 --> 00:57:20.709
But this is the
way it has to be.

625
00:57:48.038 --> 00:57:49.034
- It's okay.

626
00:57:52.041 --> 00:57:52.873
- Okay.

627
00:58:30.277 --> 00:58:31.109
Ready?

628
00:58:39.121 --> 00:58:39.953
Aim.

629
00:58:50.033 --> 00:58:50.627
Fire.

630
00:59:38.209 --> 00:59:40.978
- This whole thing is
not going very well.

631
00:59:41.014 --> 00:59:43.419
We have to convince
the higher command

632
00:59:43.455 --> 00:59:45.321
to use the all
resources to repel

633
00:59:45.356 --> 00:59:47.589
an invasion on the beaches.

634
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.365
- Nobody wants to admit
they might be wrong

635
01:00:03.542 --> 01:00:05.269
and lose their face
in front of the fear.

636
01:00:07.039 --> 01:00:10.076
- It's the same
shit it always was.

637
01:00:11.076 --> 01:00:13.550
They are wars run
by desk generals

638
01:00:13.585 --> 01:00:18.516
who never shed any
blood and any dirt ever.

639
01:00:18.552 --> 01:00:20.123
- That's right.

640
01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.125
- Of course it is.

641
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.625
- That's why you and I.

642
01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:25.894
we have to make the
most compelling report

643
01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:29.359
that the Field Marshall can
present to Hitler himself.

644
01:00:31.202 --> 01:00:32.065
- I understand.

645
01:00:32.964 --> 01:00:34.265
I'm gonna do my very best.

646
01:01:22.186 --> 01:01:24.115
- Get ready.

647
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:26.715
- Gotta put your gas
as soon as possible.

648
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:27.653
- Stand up

649
01:01:27.689 --> 01:01:28.990
- Straight line let's go.

650
01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.467
Sound of equipment check.

651
01:01:38.503 --> 01:01:39.700
Everything okay.

652
01:01:39.736 --> 01:01:40.700
Everything okay.

653
01:01:40.736 --> 01:01:41.701
Everything okay.

654
01:01:41.737 --> 01:01:42.701
Everything okay.

655
01:01:52.448 --> 01:01:54.081
- Go. go. go. go.

656
01:02:02.623 --> 01:02:04.091
Go. go. go. go.

657
01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:12.935
Go. go.

658
01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:45.297
- Remember our motto gentlemen.

659
01:02:45.332 --> 01:02:49.403
No mission too typical for
a sacrifice to the grave.

660
01:02:49.438 --> 01:02:50.265
Duty first.

661
01:02:50.301 --> 01:02:52.139
We're the first
infantry division.

662
01:02:53.139 --> 01:02:54.873
We've done Africa.
we've done Sicily.

663
01:02:54.908 --> 01:02:57.077
and now we're doing France.

664
01:02:57.113 --> 01:02:59.976
They know we're coming.
they know we're the best.

665
01:03:00.011 --> 01:03:01.680
- How you guys feeling?

666
01:03:01.715 --> 01:03:02.749
- Good Lieutenant.

667
01:03:02.784 --> 01:03:05.020
- I'm nauseous sir.

668
01:03:05.055 --> 01:03:07.455
- I don't
blame you. I'm nauseous too.

669
01:03:07.491 --> 01:03:09.358
- Are you all right?

670
01:03:09.393 --> 01:03:11.123
Are you all right?

671
01:03:11.158 --> 01:03:15.064
All the new guys.
stick with your mate.

672
01:03:15.099 --> 01:03:17.831
All the obstacles are gonna
be pre-sighted on the beach.

673
01:03:17.867 --> 01:03:21.032
Do not bunch up
near an obstacle.

674
01:03:21.068 --> 01:03:22.571
Spread out and
get up to the hill

675
01:03:22.606 --> 01:03:25.139
as fast as you possibly can.

676
01:03:56.407 --> 01:03:57.567
- Sound it up.

677
01:04:04.075 --> 01:04:06.114
- Alarm. quick. quick.

678
01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.319
- Hello

679
01:04:14.953 --> 01:04:16.592
- This is it.

680
01:04:16.627 --> 01:04:19.325
- Alarm. alarm.

681
01:04:23.668 --> 01:04:24.963
- I need to know
what's going on.

682
01:04:24.998 --> 01:04:26.503
The men are confused out there.

683
01:04:26.538 --> 01:04:28.098
First you call

684
01:04:28.133 --> 01:04:29.538
- Horizon is full of ships.

685
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.338
- Come out.

686
01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:35.839
Come out. Americans coming.

687
01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:41.347
- Oh my God.

688
01:05:12.113 --> 01:05:14.812
- Tell the cannons
to fire at will.

689
01:05:14.847 --> 01:05:15.648
- Yes. sir.

690
01:05:15.684 --> 01:05:16.484
- Well in range.

691
01:05:16.519 --> 01:05:17.518
- Yes. sir.

692
01:05:25.431 --> 01:05:26.321
- Is there any hope?

693
01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:28.930
The Luftwaffe will show today?

694
01:05:28.965 --> 01:05:31.401
- I will spend a
lot of

695
01:05:31.436 --> 01:05:32.398
We'll do our best.

696
01:05:44.346 --> 01:05:48.986
- Where the hell did they
get all those ships from.

697
01:06:05.834 --> 01:06:07.537
- That was position one.

698
01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.437
- Position one is
lost. report it.

699
01:06:17.715 --> 01:06:19.780
- One minute to the beach.

700
01:06:19.815 --> 01:06:21.744
One minute to the beach.

701
01:06:27.986 --> 01:06:28.985
- Get ready.

702
01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.287
- Stand by.

703
01:06:30.323 --> 01:06:32.825
- Go. get the hell
outta my boat.

704
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.460
- Go. go. go. go.

705
01:06:35.599 --> 01:06:36.532
Get off the boat.

706
01:06:36.567 --> 01:06:38.733
Get off the boat.

707
01:06:47.875 --> 01:06:49.342
Jesus Christ.

708
01:06:49.378 --> 01:06:51.807
Jesus Christ. I just lost
every guy on my boat.

709
01:07:11.997 --> 01:07:13.103
- Go go go.

710
01:07:23.779 --> 01:07:25.412
- Go. go. go. go.

711
01:07:35.859 --> 01:07:36.923
- We're getting killed out.

712
01:07:36.959 --> 01:07:38.089
Move up towards the banks.

713
01:07:38.125 --> 01:07:39.626
Soldier. move your men up.

714
01:07:39.662 --> 01:07:40.526
Let's go.

715
01:08:21.506 --> 01:08:22.337
- Oh God.

716
01:08:33.751 --> 01:08:38.350
- Make room. we're here.

717
01:08:38.385 --> 01:08:40.017
- Come on second
squad. move in now.

718
01:08:40.052 --> 01:08:41.257
Move in now.

719
01:08:46.896 --> 01:08:48.490
- Sir. I'm the last one.

720
01:08:48.525 --> 01:08:51.366
- Where the rest of the guys?

721
01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.642
- Hold your head.

722
01:09:08.115 --> 01:09:09.311
- Get off the boat.

723
01:09:09.346 --> 01:09:11.117
Get off the boat.

724
01:09:11.152 --> 01:09:12.918
- Right here. and here. boom.

725
01:09:12.954 --> 01:09:14.251
- Then find him.

726
01:09:14.286 --> 01:09:15.621
This is not an exercise.

727
01:09:19.725 --> 01:09:22.461
- I suggest that we move
two infantry regiments

728
01:09:22.496 --> 01:09:24.497
and one artillery
regiment into the area

729
01:09:24.532 --> 01:09:26.429
to provide proper support
should the invasion

730
01:09:26.464 --> 01:09:28.271
occur in that particular sector.

731
01:09:50.259 --> 01:09:50.920
- Okay. we gotta
get off this beach.

732
01:09:53.697 --> 01:09:54.624
Fuck you.

733
01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.695
- That time the ally
would be in Paris.

734
01:09:58.364 --> 01:10:00.564
- Jesus. block them on purpose.

735
01:10:00.599 --> 01:10:03.134
Jesus. I lost every
guy on my boat.

736
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.969
- You got a smoke?

737
01:10:04.005 --> 01:10:04.835
- Oh yeah. sir.

738
01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:06.872
- You got a light?

739
01:10:06.907 --> 01:10:08.176
Fuck.

740
01:10:08.211 --> 01:10:09.910
- We gotta get off
the fucking beach.

741
01:10:09.945 --> 01:10:11.147
- I'm fucking wet.

742
01:10:11.182 --> 01:10:12.010
- I'm damn wetter
than you fucking are.

743
01:10:12.045 --> 01:10:12.843
- Fuck you.

744
01:10:15.181 --> 01:10:16.483
- Jesus Christ.

745
01:10:16.519 --> 01:10:18.550
- The ally of France that
made attack in Normandy.

746
01:10:18.586 --> 01:10:21.090
I have no time to wait.
do you not understand?

747
01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:23.293
I see a thousand
ships on the ocean.

748
01:10:24.191 --> 01:10:26.525
No. I'm dead serious.

749
01:10:26.561 --> 01:10:29.733
Why do you not come here
and see for yourself?

750
01:10:36.873 --> 01:10:38.506
- I need a medic.

751
01:10:39.577 --> 01:10:40.170
Medic

752
01:10:41.909 --> 01:10:42.708
- Move

753
01:11:03.031 --> 01:11:04.664
- Go. go. go. go.

754
01:11:19.918 --> 01:11:21.780
- Lower your fucking head.

755
01:11:22.887 --> 01:11:25.315
What is everyone else?

756
01:11:25.351 --> 01:11:27.757
- I'm the last one.

757
01:11:38.033 --> 01:11:39.094
Anton. Anton.

758
01:11:44.503 --> 01:11:47.140
- You. I want that 42 taken out.

759
01:11:47.175 --> 01:11:50.043
- MG 42 on the right.

760
01:12:04.996 --> 01:12:06.893
- We gotta get off this beach.

761
01:12:06.928 --> 01:12:07.656
- Yeah.

762
01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:08.862
- We gotta get off the beach.

763
01:12:08.897 --> 01:12:09.795
- Go.

764
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:18.474
- Patrol. let's
move. let's move.

765
01:12:19.844 --> 01:12:21.536
- Everyone fire.

766
01:12:24.013 --> 01:12:25.514
- Get up here now.

767
01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:28.916
Move.

768
01:12:28.951 --> 01:12:29.782
- Let's go.

769
01:12:45.098 --> 01:12:45.930
- Move.

770
01:12:49.874 --> 01:12:53.074
- Coming fire.

771
01:13:10.127 --> 01:13:11.155
- I can't wait till morning

772
01:13:11.191 --> 01:13:12.724
- Oh shit.

773
01:13:12.759 --> 01:13:14.930
- I'll get the blood
pumping. all right.

774
01:13:15.693 --> 01:13:16.931
Where are your boys from?

775
01:13:16.967 --> 01:13:17.965
- Oh. Tennessee.

776
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:18.834
- Tennessee?

777
01:13:18.869 --> 01:13:19.934
- Wisconsin.

778
01:13:19.969 --> 01:13:20.936
- Wisconsin.

779
01:13:20.971 --> 01:13:21.564
- What about you?

780
01:13:21.599 --> 01:13:22.604
- No way cheese head.

781
01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:30.441
- What do we now?

782
01:13:30.476 --> 01:13:31.274
- We get off this beach.

783
01:13:31.309 --> 01:13:32.812
- Why?

784
01:13:32.847 --> 01:13:34.378
Because if the blood foot
happens. where do we move?

785
01:13:35.414 --> 01:13:36.583
- We're gonna die.

786
01:13:36.618 --> 01:13:38.252
- The only people
that you're gonna see

787
01:13:38.287 --> 01:13:39.220
if you don't get off this beach.

788
01:13:39.255 --> 01:13:40.617
is great registration and God.

789
01:13:40.652 --> 01:13:42.651
Now. get up over that hill.

790
01:13:46.262 --> 01:13:48.564
Move out. go. go. go. go.

791
01:14:49.687 --> 01:14:50.886
- All clear. let's go.

792
01:14:50.922 --> 01:14:54.062
Five. six quarters
get out of here.

793
01:14:54.098 --> 01:14:54.960
- This is not good.

794
01:14:56.034 --> 01:14:57.132
- They're too strong.

795
01:15:00.138 --> 01:15:01.563
- We have a close defense.

796
01:15:01.598 --> 01:15:02.704
- Yes. sir.

797
01:15:39.972 --> 01:15:41.809
- Sir. we have contact
with the beaches.

798
01:15:42.776 --> 01:15:43.940
- This
is not. this is--

799
01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:54.223
- General.

800
01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:56.156
- What's the situation soldier?

801
01:15:56.192 --> 01:15:57.355
- It's hopeless.

802
01:15:57.391 --> 01:15:58.758
- I understand.

803
01:15:58.794 --> 01:16:01.257
- This will be the final
report from Normandy.

804
01:16:03.033 --> 01:16:04.330
Yes. sir.

805
01:16:04.365 --> 01:16:05.327
God bless Germany.

806
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:07.670
All right.

807
01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:03.253
- I'll fight too.

808
01:17:05.228 --> 01:17:06.921
- Let's go fight.

809
01:17:06.957 --> 01:17:09.325
- Let's go fight. come on.

810
01:17:40.693 --> 01:17:41.525
- Good luck my friend.

811
01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:46.333
- Good luck

812
01:18:37.915 --> 01:18:39.888
- Let's go. let's go.

813
01:18:48.498 --> 01:18:49.931
- Let's get to the artillery.

814
01:19:02.774 --> 01:19:04.209
- Hey move. move.

815
01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.842
- Where the hell
have y'all been?

816
01:19:38.877 --> 01:19:39.877
- Where have we been?

817
01:19:39.912 --> 01:19:41.548
- Yes. where have you been?

818
01:19:41.584 --> 01:19:42.517
I've been here all night.

819
01:19:42.552 --> 01:19:44.450
- I lost every guy on the boat.

820
01:19:44.486 --> 01:19:45.316
- Well welcome--

821
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:47.189
- Everybody on the...

822
01:19:47.225 --> 01:19:47.951
Hey. hey. hey.

823
01:19:47.986 --> 01:19:50.291
- Krause. where do you need us?

824
01:19:50.326 --> 01:19:51.353
- This way?

825
01:19:51.389 --> 01:19:52.821
You feeling froggy sir
or you want me on point?

826
01:19:52.857 --> 01:19:53.758
- After you Tom.

827
01:19:53.793 --> 01:19:55.428
- Appreciate it. sir.

828
01:19:55.463 --> 01:19:56.261
- Airborne.

829
01:20:01.303 --> 01:20:02.435
- Hey.

830
01:20:02.471 --> 01:20:03.271
- Hey. Colorado.

831
01:20:03.306 --> 01:20:04.267
- Tennessee.

832
01:20:04.302 --> 01:20:05.408
- How're you doing
bud. good to see you.

833
01:20:05.443 --> 01:20:06.167
- You made it off the beach.

834
01:20:06.202 --> 01:20:07.408
- Yeah. see you did too man.

835
01:20:07.444 --> 01:20:08.336
- What's your name?

836
01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:09.511
- It's Garonne.
everybody calls me Gar.

837
01:20:09.546 --> 01:20:10.779
- Gar. nice to meet you. Lee.

838
01:20:10.815 --> 01:20:12.447
- Lee. you wanna help
me with these prisoners?

839
01:20:17.419 --> 01:20:18.418
- Sergeant?

840
01:20:18.454 --> 01:20:19.647
- Yes. Major.

841
01:20:19.683 --> 01:20:21.454
- Understand none of your
officers made it off the beach.

842
01:20:21.489 --> 01:20:22.350
- Yes. sir.

843
01:20:22.385 --> 01:20:23.618
To my understanding.
that is correct.

844
01:20:26.126 --> 01:20:28.457
- I'm gonna make you
a second Lieutenant.

845
01:20:28.493 --> 01:20:30.663
Get your unit together.
get down that course way.

846
01:20:30.699 --> 01:20:31.799
Link up with the airborne.

847
01:20:31.834 --> 01:20:33.934
they're pretty
strapped in down there.

848
01:20:33.969 --> 01:20:35.336
- Yes. sir Major. I'll
take care of it sir.

849
01:20:35.371 --> 01:20:36.435
- Carry on.

850
01:20:36.471 --> 01:20:37.335
- Yes sir.

851
01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:47.246
- So. is that a good thing?

852
01:20:49.783 --> 01:20:51.751
Come on. get your gear.

853
01:20:51.786 --> 01:20:53.047
Let's go help out the airborne.

854
01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:54.286
- Roger. Lieutenant.

855
01:20:57.153 --> 01:20:59.021
- Second up. second up.

856
01:21:25.721 --> 01:21:27.719
- We made it off the beach.

857
01:21:27.755 --> 01:21:29.420
- We're getting out.

858
01:21:43.908 --> 01:21:46.371
- Burn the papers and
kill all the prisoners.

859
01:22:18.708 --> 01:22:20.201
- There's more Germans coming.

860
01:22:20.236 --> 01:22:21.373
When I say go. we go.

861
01:22:22.810 --> 01:22:24.475
Three. two. one. go.

862
01:22:35.622 --> 01:22:36.421
- Alarm.

863
01:23:14.631 --> 01:23:15.429
- Come on. let's move.

864
01:23:15.465 --> 01:23:16.296
Let's go.

865
01:23:30.141 --> 01:23:32.114
- First one. come on.

866
01:24:03.474 --> 01:24:05.646
Put your weapons
down. come on get up.

867
01:24:05.682 --> 01:24:07.479
- Get up right now.

868
01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:16.818
- They're just a
bunch of kids Serg.

869
01:24:22.259 --> 01:24:23.695
- Get up right now.

870
01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:24.562
Get up.

871
01:24:27.769 --> 01:24:28.669
- Don't shoot.

872
01:24:28.705 --> 01:24:30.469
Please don't shoot.

873
01:24:46.454 --> 01:24:49.521
- I haven't taken a decent
shit since the D-Day.

874
01:24:57.964 --> 01:25:00.866
Oh. God.

875
01:27:29.985 --> 01:27:30.950
- You can't shoot us.

876
01:27:30.986 --> 01:27:31.986
You can't shoot us.

877
01:27:32.021 --> 01:27:33.853
It's against the convention.

878
01:27:39.024 --> 01:27:40.258
- Hey.

879
01:27:40.293 --> 01:27:42.727
No. what the hell are you doing?

880
01:27:43.796 --> 01:27:47.835
This is not. how we do
things in the German army.

881
01:27:47.871 --> 01:27:48.733
- How do we behave?

882
01:27:49.667 --> 01:27:51.736
- Who the hell do
you think you are?

883
01:27:52.569 --> 01:27:54.007
We can not behave like this.

884
01:27:54.043 --> 01:27:55.507
If we behave like animals.

885
01:27:55.543 --> 01:27:57.640
history would have
justified contempt for us.

886
01:27:57.675 --> 01:28:00.074
This is not how German
officers behave.

887
01:28:20.596 --> 01:28:22.168
- What's going on here?

888
01:28:22.203 --> 01:28:24.173
- This man has interrupted us.

889
01:28:24.208 --> 01:28:26.172
- They're shooting
on prisoners general.

890
01:28:26.207 --> 01:28:27.772
This is not how we do things.

891
01:28:29.774 --> 01:28:31.177
- Do you know how
many German soldiers

892
01:28:31.212 --> 01:28:32.810
will lose their lives over this?

893
01:28:34.746 --> 01:28:36.781
The German army does
not shoot prisoners.

894
01:28:37.988 --> 01:28:39.784
You better leave this out to us.

895
01:28:52.398 --> 01:28:54.769
Captain. you have a situation.

896
01:28:54.805 --> 01:28:55.668
Take care of it.

897
01:29:07.111 --> 01:29:11.214
- When you remember Germans.
we are not all like this.

898
01:29:11.249 --> 01:29:13.318
- Thank you.

899
01:29:13.353 --> 01:29:14.986
- I remember you. thank you.

900
01:29:15.022 --> 01:29:16.152
Thank you.

901
01:29:16.188 --> 01:29:16.986
Thank you.

902
01:29:29.336 --> 01:29:31.806
- Well. we made it Lieutenant.

903
01:29:31.842 --> 01:29:32.672
- Yes we did.

904
01:29:35.210 --> 01:29:36.841
- Guess that's all we can do.

905
01:29:38.075 --> 01:29:41.579
Make it through today.
make it through tomorrow.

906
01:29:41.614 --> 01:29:43.683
Make it through
the day after that.

907
01:29:43.719 --> 01:29:46.620
And just keep making it till
the end of this damn war.

908
01:29:48.423 --> 01:29:51.119
- Well. I've made
it perfectly clear

909
01:29:51.154 --> 01:29:55.860
I have no intention of dying
in this place. you know?

910
01:29:56.696 --> 01:29:59.732
20 years from now.
when this is all over.

911
01:30:00.801 --> 01:30:03.703
back in Tennessee. I'll be
sitting around a campfire.

912
01:30:03.738 --> 01:30:08.136
just like this telling
stories to my grandchildren.

913
01:30:10.776 --> 01:30:12.844
- What are you gonna
tell 'em about today?

914
01:30:22.685 --> 01:30:24.119
- Not a goddamn thing.

915
01:30:41.776 --> 01:30:44.044
- Sergeant. sergeant.
the Americans are coming.

916
01:30:44.079 --> 01:30:45.011
- All right. men.

917
01:30:45.047 --> 01:30:46.482
Take positions.

918
01:31:10.701 --> 01:31:12.974
- Hey. the Americans in here.

919
01:31:23.485 --> 01:31:24.746
- Yeah. I'll be
damned if I'm gonna

920
01:31:24.781 --> 01:31:27.186
get killed here at this bridge.

921
01:31:29.323 --> 01:31:30.625
- We made it this far.

922
01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:39.031
- You got a smoke?

923
01:31:39.066 --> 01:31:39.898
- Yeah.

924
01:31:41.335 --> 01:31:42.604
- So what's going on?

925
01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.370
- Just bear that at least.

926
01:31:45.406 --> 01:31:46.905
- Didn't mean for you Tom.

927
01:31:47.936 --> 01:31:49.405
- All right. So what's the deal?

928
01:31:49.441 --> 01:31:51.379
- Well. I got--

929
01:31:51.415 --> 01:31:53.014
- Will you get that
fucking thing out?

930
01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:54.410
- I'm trying. Sir.

931
01:31:54.446 --> 01:31:55.914
- Jesus Christ.

932
01:31:57.450 --> 01:31:58.782
- Sir. I need some help.

933
01:31:58.818 --> 01:32:00.280
I got guys pinned
down at this bridge.

934
01:32:00.316 --> 01:32:02.787
but we've been trying to
all morning and all night.

935
01:32:02.822 --> 01:32:04.956
I need as much help
as you can give me.

936
01:32:05.624 --> 01:32:07.358
- Where's your fucking bridge?

937
01:32:07.393 --> 01:32:08.291
- It's right here.

938
01:32:08.327 --> 01:32:09.496
All right.

939
01:32:09.531 --> 01:32:10.929
You come up this
road about two clicks

940
01:32:10.965 --> 01:32:12.359
and then take a left. you'll
run right into the bridge.

941
01:32:12.395 --> 01:32:14.303
We got German forces right
here that are plummeting us

942
01:32:14.338 --> 01:32:15.802
with machine gun
and small arms fire.

943
01:32:15.838 --> 01:32:18.638
I need every guy that can
breathe and pull a trigger.

944
01:32:18.673 --> 01:32:20.141
- We're gonna have to
go around the flank.

945
01:32:20.176 --> 01:32:21.575
It's gonna take time.

946
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:23.276
- Doesn't do us any
good taking that bridge

947
01:32:23.311 --> 01:32:24.478
without taking the town.

948
01:32:24.513 --> 01:32:25.411
- You come past
this village about--

949
01:32:25.446 --> 01:32:26.745
- Are you fucking happy now?

950
01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:29.114
- Yes Private. damn.
do you want a cookie?

951
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:30.546
- Jesus.

952
01:32:33.751 --> 01:32:35.157
- We gotta help him take it.

953
01:32:35.192 --> 01:32:36.320
So come on. let's move out.

954
01:32:36.355 --> 01:32:37.252
Keep going.

955
01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:41.425
- You. hold this bridge.
hold this at all costs.

956
01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:42.593
Do you understand?

957
01:32:42.628 --> 01:32:44.560
I'm going for reinforcements.

958
01:32:59.911 --> 01:33:01.083
- We got 'em pushed
off the bridge.

959
01:33:01.118 --> 01:33:02.046
We gotta make it over.

960
01:33:05.719 --> 01:33:07.650
- Supported by tanks
and half tracks.

961
01:33:07.686 --> 01:33:08.815
- All right guys. move on.

962
01:33:08.851 --> 01:33:10.224
Let's go. let's go.

963
01:33:10.259 --> 01:33:11.585
Push up on the right.

964
01:33:11.621 --> 01:33:12.826
- Lively.

965
01:33:34.512 --> 01:33:35.343
- Out. out

966
01:33:39.518 --> 01:33:41.085
- A single there.

967
01:33:54.163 --> 01:33:55.365
- But we have some
more tanks coming.

968
01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.570
- Good.

969
01:33:56.605 --> 01:33:57.904
- What do you
think we should do?

970
01:33:58.973 --> 01:34:00.773
- Well. I don't want to go
back to the Eastern Front.

971
01:34:00.808 --> 01:34:03.043
So I suggest we try to
get back to Germany.

972
01:34:03.078 --> 01:34:03.910
- Yes.

973
01:34:06.909 --> 01:34:08.112
- Put him in the house.

974
01:34:30.972 --> 01:34:34.402
- Klaus I tell you. this
has been a very tough day.

975
01:34:35.642 --> 01:34:37.141
- Tomorrow will be longer.

976
01:34:48.356 --> 01:34:50.322
- Over there.

977
01:34:59.633 --> 01:35:01.763
- General. there's water inside.

978
01:35:01.799 --> 01:35:03.002
It's an aid station.

979
01:35:10.039 --> 01:35:11.541
Good to see you again. sir.

980
01:35:11.576 --> 01:35:12.479
- Well done.

981
01:35:12.514 --> 01:35:13.980
- Let's have a look at that.

982
01:35:14.016 --> 01:35:15.315
Would you have a look at the
general's arm here please

983
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:16.376
- Quickly though.

984
01:35:16.412 --> 01:35:18.380
I don't want too much
time away from the men.

985
01:35:22.159 --> 01:35:23.256
- I understand.

986
01:35:23.292 --> 01:35:24.356
Right this way.

987
01:35:24.392 --> 01:35:25.986
- Come sit down.

988
01:35:26.021 --> 01:35:27.122
- What's the situation?

989
01:35:27.157 --> 01:35:29.258
- We've been spotted
from the air.

990
01:35:29.293 --> 01:35:32.233
Last I heard. the beaches
were no longer ours.

991
01:35:32.268 --> 01:35:33.300
What did you hear?

992
01:35:33.336 --> 01:35:34.268
- I heard the same.

993
01:35:34.303 --> 01:35:35.698
- That's not good.

994
01:35:35.734 --> 01:35:36.838
- It is not indeed.

995
01:35:37.805 --> 01:35:39.166
We'll have shelter
for the moment.

996
01:35:39.202 --> 01:35:40.976
Spend the best of
it and regroup.

997
01:35:41.011 --> 01:35:41.843
- Right.

998
01:35:42.905 --> 01:35:43.944
- Stay with us.

999
01:35:45.777 --> 01:35:47.380
- I've got the morphine.

1000
01:35:47.415 --> 01:35:48.811
- Thank you. Mike.

1001
01:35:52.081 --> 01:35:55.054
- Airplane. airplane.

1002
01:35:56.724 --> 01:35:58.151
- Get everything
under the trees.

1003
01:35:58.187 --> 01:36:00.393
Under the trees.
everything. now.

1004
01:36:11.505 --> 01:36:12.440
- Take cover.

1005
01:36:12.475 --> 01:36:14.605
Take cover. under the trees now.

1006
01:36:32.659 --> 01:36:34.495
- Captain. Captain.

1007
01:36:34.530 --> 01:36:36.062
American tanks on the road.

1008
01:36:36.730 --> 01:36:38.129
- That's your department.

1009
01:36:38.164 --> 01:36:39.964
- Do you wanna come
along for the ride Klaus?

1010
01:36:39.999 --> 01:36:41.433
- No. I take my
chance on the ground.

1011
01:36:41.468 --> 01:36:42.665
- Good luck.

1012
01:36:42.701 --> 01:36:43.500
- See you after.

1013
01:36:43.535 --> 01:36:44.367
- Yeah.

1014
01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.017
- What will happen to us?

1015
01:36:59.053 --> 01:37:01.450
- These are the Americans.
not the Russians.

1016
01:37:09.793 --> 01:37:10.696
- Captain.

1017
01:37:10.731 --> 01:37:11.933
- What's going on out there?

1018
01:37:16.671 --> 01:37:17.604
- We're holding the bridge here.

1019
01:37:17.639 --> 01:37:18.767
but we don't have enough men.

1020
01:37:18.802 --> 01:37:20.274
I need help.

1021
01:37:22.077 --> 01:37:24.576
- We have two tank destroyers
that are in the woods.

1022
01:37:24.612 --> 01:37:25.907
waiting for defense.

1023
01:37:25.943 --> 01:37:27.414
- Go bring them in.

1024
01:37:27.449 --> 01:37:28.442
They're over here.

1025
01:37:28.477 --> 01:37:30.178
Bring one in for the
defense of the village.

1026
01:37:30.214 --> 01:37:31.716
Send the other
one to the bridge.

1027
01:37:31.752 --> 01:37:33.383
- We can. we can do that.

1028
01:37:33.418 --> 01:37:35.187
- If we can hold long
enough to get the civilians

1029
01:37:35.222 --> 01:37:38.392
and the wounded out of the
village. there's a chance.

1030
01:37:38.428 --> 01:37:39.592
- My men can do it.

1031
01:37:39.627 --> 01:37:41.061
- Let's make it happen.

1032
01:37:43.465 --> 01:37:44.427
- Off kids. Lewis.

1033
01:37:48.768 --> 01:37:50.103
- Get him up that road.

1034
01:38:21.267 --> 01:38:24.300
- I sure ain't giving
up that place easily.

1035
01:38:24.335 --> 01:38:26.173
- City brass hanging
around up in there?

1036
01:38:26.208 --> 01:38:28.508
- Yeah. there was some. but
they've already lost one tank.

1037
01:38:28.544 --> 01:38:29.637
We'll get in there.

1038
01:38:33.110 --> 01:38:34.277
- Man. they're surrounded.

1039
01:38:34.312 --> 01:38:35.542
What the hell do they
keep fighting for?

1040
01:38:35.578 --> 01:38:37.850
- Probably 'cause they're
arrogant bastards.

1041
01:38:37.886 --> 01:38:40.217
Look. let's just
call the air core.

1042
01:38:40.252 --> 01:38:42.687
Have 'em come in.
flat the fucking place

1043
01:38:42.723 --> 01:38:43.890
and be done with it.

1044
01:38:43.925 --> 01:38:45.585
- Now look. there's
some of the guys

1045
01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:48.162
already seen nurses
running around in there.

1046
01:38:48.197 --> 01:38:50.828
- I'm not gonna be the guy
that kills a bunch of nurses.

1047
01:38:50.863 --> 01:38:52.363
Even if they are krauts.

1048
01:38:53.063 --> 01:38:54.335
- I'll tell you what?

1049
01:38:54.371 --> 01:38:55.601
We take a squad.

1050
01:38:55.636 --> 01:38:57.133
Flanking maneuver.

1051
01:38:57.169 --> 01:38:58.639
We'll go around
through the back.

1052
01:38:58.674 --> 01:39:00.139
come up through the middle.

1053
01:39:00.175 --> 01:39:02.670
cut the bastards in half.
or make 'em surrender.

1054
01:39:06.847 --> 01:39:08.580
- Yeah. I'll go with you.

1055
01:39:08.616 --> 01:39:09.845
- Outstanding.

1056
01:39:09.881 --> 01:39:11.115
- Let's do it.

1057
01:39:11.151 --> 01:39:12.451
- They'll take any
unnecessary chances.

1058
01:39:12.486 --> 01:39:13.621
- Right?

1059
01:39:13.656 --> 01:39:14.750
- Like it should in the war.

1060
01:39:14.786 --> 01:39:15.588
- Ballsy.

1061
01:39:15.624 --> 01:39:17.355
Stupid. but ballsy.

1062
01:39:24.532 --> 01:39:25.429
- Get that.

1063
01:39:44.048 --> 01:39:45.451
- I need a scout up here

1064
01:39:45.486 --> 01:39:46.818
You go.

1065
01:39:46.853 --> 01:39:47.985
Keep it on that post.

1066
01:39:48.020 --> 01:39:48.953
When you see them. let me know.

1067
01:39:48.988 --> 01:39:50.887
- We'll come back and get you.

1068
01:39:51.921 --> 01:39:52.753
What?

1069
01:39:57.226 --> 01:39:58.627
All right. let's do it.

1070
01:40:03.332 --> 01:40:05.040
Let's clear this area right now.

1071
01:40:17.587 --> 01:40:18.878
Shoot down that road.

1072
01:40:18.914 --> 01:40:22.049
We're gonna get online with
the rest of the infantry.

1073
01:40:38.606 --> 01:40:39.602
- Pull back.

1074
01:40:40.336 --> 01:40:43.177
- There they're at 20 meters.

1075
01:40:56.691 --> 01:40:58.390
- Get on the back.

1076
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:05.661
- Out out.

1077
01:41:09.266 --> 01:41:13.240
- Hey. in here.

1078
01:41:25.655 --> 01:41:26.550
- You come with me.

1079
01:41:41.969 --> 01:41:44.238
Don't let 'em in the village.

1080
01:42:13.998 --> 01:42:14.829
- Go. go.

1081
01:42:17.132 --> 01:42:18.173
Go.

1082
01:42:18.971 --> 01:42:20.406
Go. go. now go.

1083
01:42:23.512 --> 01:42:24.240
- Klaus

1084
01:42:24.275 --> 01:42:25.073
- Take the general to safety.

1085
01:42:25.108 --> 01:42:25.911
- Hurry up.

1086
01:42:25.946 --> 01:42:27.582
- Take him out of here.

1087
01:43:55.737 --> 01:43:56.700
- Let's go.

1088
01:44:08.717 --> 01:44:09.811
- Colonel.

1089
01:44:09.847 --> 01:44:11.618
Colonel. I would ask that
you accept my surrender.

1090
01:44:11.654 --> 01:44:12.485
- I will.

1091
01:44:31.301 --> 01:44:32.805
- Hey Lieutenant.

1092
01:44:32.841 --> 01:44:34.438
- Hello Major.

1093
01:44:34.473 --> 01:44:36.377
- Glad to see you're
still with us.

1094
01:44:37.746 --> 01:44:38.338
- Yes. sir.

1095
01:44:38.374 --> 01:44:39.275
Glad to be here.

1096
01:44:39.311 --> 01:44:40.477
- If you hop in back here.

1097
01:44:40.512 --> 01:44:41.542
we're gonna run down
the road and see

1098
01:44:41.577 --> 01:44:42.777
if Jerry's got a line set up.

1099
01:44:42.812 --> 01:44:44.544
Or if they're still
running like rabbits.

1100
01:44:44.579 --> 01:44:46.321
- Outstanding. will do.

1101
01:44:47.522 --> 01:44:48.887
- It'll be all right son.
medics are on the way.

1102
01:44:48.923 --> 01:44:50.253
- I'll be fine.

1103
01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:56.458
- Do you know where
the hell you're going?

1104
01:44:56.493 --> 01:44:58.394
Don't fall off there airborne.

1105
01:44:58.429 --> 01:45:00.060
- I made it first before you--

1106
01:45:00.995 --> 01:45:04.498
- You know you could
always get off and walk.

1107
01:45:22.451 --> 01:45:23.523
- Is that loaded?

1108
01:45:26.963 --> 01:45:28.396
Hit that tank over there.

1109
01:45:29.866 --> 01:45:31.025
But wait for my signal.

1110
01:45:39.909 --> 01:45:41.101
Wait for my signal.

1111
01:45:56.618 --> 01:45:58.218
- Hey. we got one there.

1112
01:45:58.254 --> 01:45:59.086
Hey.

1113
01:46:34.556 --> 01:46:36.763
- Get up. get up.

1114
01:46:36.798 --> 01:46:37.630
Come on.

1115
01:46:39.834 --> 01:46:40.666
Oh God.

1116
01:46:44.336 --> 01:46:45.605
- I know that voice.

1117
01:46:46.570 --> 01:46:47.904
- I'm glad you're not dead.

1118
01:46:51.046 --> 01:46:53.775
What are you doing here?

1119
01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:56.743
Well. since you
decided to get yourself

1120
01:46:56.778 --> 01:46:58.453
blown up in Russia with me.

1121
01:46:59.619 --> 01:47:02.418
we got sent to the same
hospital in France.

1122
01:47:02.453 --> 01:47:04.118
Not that you remember.

1123
01:47:05.756 --> 01:47:07.687
- It's hard to
remember a damn thing.

1124
01:47:07.722 --> 01:47:09.789
Not even your ugly face.

1125
01:47:09.824 --> 01:47:11.565
- It's good to see you too.

1126
01:47:17.303 --> 01:47:18.873
Let's get outta here.

1127
01:47:18.908 --> 01:47:19.804
- What do you see?

1128
01:47:28.143 --> 01:47:32.052
- Americans on one side.
British on the others.

1129
01:47:32.087 --> 01:47:33.114
along there. Germans.

1130
01:47:34.253 --> 01:47:35.116
- No Russians?

1131
01:47:36.286 --> 01:47:37.419
- No.

1132
01:47:37.455 --> 01:47:38.658
- That will be okay.

1133
01:47:39.424 --> 01:47:40.627
- You're optimistic.

1134
01:47:42.295 --> 01:47:44.128
- It'll be just fine.

1135
01:47:54.204 --> 01:47:57.375
The Americans will shoot up
anything moving on the ground.

1136
01:47:57.410 --> 01:47:59.008
- Well. except one of their own.

1137
01:48:11.159 --> 01:48:13.486
- You mean like a jeep?

1138
01:48:13.521 --> 01:48:14.562
- Yep.

1139
01:48:16.495 --> 01:48:17.824
- You wanna hand me that sir?

1140
01:48:17.859 --> 01:48:19.633
- Here. hold this for a minute.

1141
01:48:21.265 --> 01:48:22.097
- Yeah.

1142
01:48:25.602 --> 01:48:27.641
- Well. this is smart.

1143
01:48:29.111 --> 01:48:30.006
- We need a diversion.

1144
01:48:31.477 --> 01:48:33.075
- So we started here. sir.

1145
01:48:41.024 --> 01:48:42.417
- The hell was that?

1146
01:48:42.453 --> 01:48:43.352
Was that ours?

1147
01:48:43.388 --> 01:48:45.156
- No. can't be.

1148
01:48:45.191 --> 01:48:46.022
- Let's go.

1149
01:48:50.396 --> 01:48:51.426
- You know I heard--

1150
01:48:51.462 --> 01:48:52.633
- Nick Sheeson?

1151
01:48:55.630 --> 01:48:57.101
- Oh. shit.

1152
01:48:57.137 --> 01:48:58.402
Cigarette?

1153
01:48:58.437 --> 01:48:59.937
- Smoking's bad for you.

1154
01:49:02.871 --> 01:49:04.242
Major. if you don't mind.

1155
01:49:04.277 --> 01:49:05.173
I need your jeep.

1156
01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:14.820
- Wait. I know you.

1157
01:49:18.989 --> 01:49:21.059
- I'm just another
ugly kraut to you. yes?

1158
01:49:21.094 --> 01:49:22.196
- No.

1159
01:49:22.231 --> 01:49:23.890
- You were on the motorcycle.

1160
01:49:23.925 --> 01:49:26.029
You almost ran over my ass.

1161
01:49:27.971 --> 01:49:28.933
- That was you?

1162
01:49:30.105 --> 01:49:31.203
I'm very sorry.

1163
01:49:31.238 --> 01:49:32.200
I didn't mean to.

1164
01:49:33.101 --> 01:49:35.005
- What are you
talking about Klaus?

1165
01:49:36.379 --> 01:49:38.041
- Take care of
yourself Sergeant.

1166
01:49:39.114 --> 01:49:40.043
- You too. sir.

1167
01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:41.874
- Major.

1168
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:43.618
- Come on Klaus. let's go.

1169
01:49:59.267 --> 01:50:00.065
- What do you think?

1170
01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:00.693
Go east?

1171
01:50:00.729 --> 01:50:01.768
- Let's go east.

1172
01:50:03.035 --> 01:50:05.832
- You wanna tell me what
the hell that was all about?

1173
01:50:13.281 --> 01:50:14.306
- Sir. that is a story

1174
01:50:14.342 --> 01:50:17.451
I'll definitely share
with my grandchildren.

1175
01:50:17.487 --> 01:50:19.014
- We got a long walk
and I'm all ears.

1176
01:50:19.049 --> 01:50:21.084
- Yeah. that's a story
I'd like to hear.
