- [Woman On TV] So I woke up
in the middle of the night

124
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:27.500
because I was stressed.

125
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.750
so I was walking from
my bedroom to my kitchen

126
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.875
to grab a glass of water.

127
00:14:31.875 --> 00:14:32.917
and I just really looked and realized

128
00:14:32.917 --> 00:14:35.500
that it was pitch black in my apartment.

129
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.709
I couldn't see anything. I
was trying to feel around.

130
00:14:37.709 --> 00:14:40.417
And I went to turn the lights
on and wake up even more.

131
00:14:40.417 --> 00:14:42.542
And then I was like. I
don't know. halfway there.

132
00:14:42.542 --> 00:14:46.959
I accidentally kicked
something from the hall.

133
00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:49.165
(indistinct chattering on TV)

134
00:14:49.165 --> 00:14:51.417
Like accidentally.

135
00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:52.959
I'd really like to emphasize accidental.

136
00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:54.792
And so I felt so bad.

137
00:14:54.792 --> 00:14:57.083
Because. yeah. I couldn't see.

138
00:14:57.083 --> 00:14:59.542

142
00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:18.792
- I am. How do you know?

143
00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:24.166

00:22:29.375 --> 00:22:32.208
(birds squawking)

191
00:23:06.291 --> 00:23:09.125
(necklace clinks)

192
00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:13.208
(necklace jangling)

193
00:23:25.291 --> 00:23:27.583
(motor buzzing)

194
00:23:27.583 --> 00:23:30.166
(horn beeping)

195
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.834
(birds chirping)

196
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:53.208
- You must be Samantha.

197
00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:54.959
I heard you were coming.

198
00:23:54.959 --> 00:23:56.041
- Yes. sir.

199
00:23:56.041 --> 00:23:57.750
You officer Thompson?

200
00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:01.458
- That's Sheriff
Thompson. but call me Sam.

201
00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:02.959
We keep it simple around here.

202
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.667
- Were you the one who
found my grandparents?

203
00:24:08.709 --> 00:24:10.667
- Awful night. Just awful.

204
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:12.959
I'm sorry for your loss.

205
00:24:13.875 --> 00:24:14.709
- Thank you.

206
00:24:15.583 --> 00:24:17.458
- Your grandparents were a fixture

207
00:24:17.458 --> 00:24:19.709
in these islands for 65 years.

208
00:24:21.458 --> 00:24:23.417
- This is only my second time out here.

209
00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:24.917
First came when I was nine

210
00:24:24.917 --> 00:24:26.250
and then my dad had a
falling out with them

211
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.417
and we moved out west.

212
00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:30.709
- Oh. I remember. Where's back west?

213
00:24:31.709 --> 00:24:32.959
- Vegas.

214
00:24:32.959 --> 00:24:35.250
- Oh. is it nice there?

215
00:24:36.709 --> 00:24:37.542
It's hot.

216
00:24:39.166 --> 00:24:41.375
Last night I came out and there was a boat

217
00:24:41.375 --> 00:24:43.208
about a hundred feet out there

218
00:24:43.208 --> 00:24:44.250
and I shot my flashlight at him.

219
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.709
he turned off his lantern and drove away.

220
00:24:46.709 --> 00:24:47.542
- Was it a male?

221
00:24:48.959 --> 00:24:50.333
- I couldn't tell.

222
00:24:50.333 --> 00:24:53.125
- Probably night fishing.
Did you call out?

223
00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:53.959
- No.

224
00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:57.125
- We deal with a few
drunk boaters around here

225
00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:59.001
and an occasional fight at the bingo game.

226
00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:00.917
but not much else.

227
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:02.583
- Dispatcher on Radio]
Sheriff. got a call about

228
00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:04.041
some teenagers in the cove.

229
00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:06.542
- Lacey kids again?

230
00:25:07.458 --> 00:25:08.500
- [Dispatcher] I think so.

231
00:25:09.458 --> 00:25:11.583
- All right. I'll head over.

232
00:25:11.583 --> 00:25:12.792
And teenagers.

233
00:25:12.792 --> 00:25:13.917
(Samantha chuckles)
Nice meeting you.

234
00:25:13.917 --> 00:25:15.291
I just stopped by to say hi.

235
00:25:17.542 --> 00:25:19.875
(upbeat rock music)
(shower spraying)

236
00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:22.792
(Samantha humming)

237
00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:32.125
(Samantha gasps)

238
00:25:37.959 --> 00:25:41.041
(crickets chirping)

239
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.250
- You scared me.

240
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:45.250
- I knocked.

241
00:25:46.959 --> 00:25:48.041
- I was in the shower.

242
00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:52.083
- Okay. Checking on you.

243
00:25:52.083 --> 00:25:54.208
Feeling good?
- I'm good.

244
00:25:54.208 --> 00:25:56.667
- Okay. good.

245
00:25:59.875 --> 00:26:01.959
- You were right about the internet.

246
00:26:01.959 --> 00:26:02.792
Three weeks.

247
00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:04.750
- Sounds about right.

248
00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:11.792
- Okay. well. if I do need anything.

249
00:26:11.792 --> 00:26:14.583
what's the best way to get ahold of you?

250
00:26:14.583 --> 00:26:17.000
- You'll see me. I'll be around.

251
00:26:21.417 --> 00:26:24.709
- Okay. I'll see you around then.

252
00:26:27.083 --> 00:26:27.917
- Okay.

253
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.083
- Okay.

254
00:26:41.417 --> 00:26:44.250
(birds chirping)

255
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.041
- [Carl On Voicemail] Hi. it's Carl.

256
00:27:00.041 --> 00:27:02.333
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

257
00:27:08.917 --> 00:27:10.917
(sighs)

258
00:27:21.542 --> 00:27:24.542
(breathes uneasily)

259
00:27:29.625 --> 00:27:31.625

263
00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:53.875
(suspenseful music)

264
00:27:53.875 --> 00:27:56.208
(wind whistling)

265
00:27:56.208 --> 00:27:59.208
(breathes uneasily)

266
00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:33.291
- Can I help you?

267
00:28:37.333 --> 00:28:40.001
(motor buzzing)

268
00:28:51.917 --> 00:28:54.417

272
00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.917

(suspenseful music)

279
00:31:02.417 --> 00:31:03.250
Micheal?

280
00:31:15.417 --> 00:31:18.250
(water splashing)

281
00:31:49.291 --> 00:31:51.792
(pump clacks)

282
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.959
(water splashing)

283
00:32:11.959 --> 00:32:15.792

284
00:32:29.542 --> 00:32:32.166
(Samantha grunting)

285
00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:34.333
(panting)

286
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:54.291
(suspenseful music)

287
00:33:36.208 --> 00:33:39.041
(worms squishing)

288
00:33:41.709 --> 00:33:44.709
(Samantha gasping)

289
00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:28.542
- 911. What's your emergency.

290
00:34:31.333 --> 00:34:32.833
- That's an interesting story.

291
00:34:33.875 --> 00:34:35.417
- So you don't believe me?

292
00:34:35.417 --> 00:34:36.750
- What happened to the box?

293
00:34:37.792 --> 00:34:38.708
- I don't know.

294
00:34:38.708 --> 00:34:40.250
It was gone after I called you.

295
00:34:41.458 --> 00:34:43.875
Last night. someone was in my house.

296
00:34:43.875 --> 00:34:44.792
- You saw someone?

297
00:34:45.708 --> 00:34:46.625
- I saw a shadow.

298
00:34:48.583 --> 00:34:51.625
and then I saw a boat
on the backside leaving.

299
00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:52.750
- Was anything stolen?

300
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:55.958
- I don't think so.

301
00:34:57.041 --> 00:34:58.917
- Probably some kids playing a prank.

302
00:35:00.792 --> 00:35:01.875
- But Michael's boat?

303
00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:05.959
- My guess is he went diving

304
00:35:05.959 --> 00:35:07.959
and the boat broke free from the anchor.

305
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.125
- Yeah. Okay.

306
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.417
- Let me be honest with you.

307
00:35:13.417 --> 00:35:15.583
I don't know much about
what happens in Vegas

308
00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:18.834
but some people around
here don't like change.

309
00:35:20.041 --> 00:35:22.041
Maybe you rubbed somebody the wrong way.

310
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:24.834
- So this is my fault?

311
00:35:26.001 --> 00:35:28.792
- I'm just saying it might
take some time to fit in.

312
00:35:34.125 --> 00:35:35.041
Carol.

313
00:35:35.041 --> 00:35:36.417
(radio static)
- Yeah Sam?

314
00:35:37.959 --> 00:35:39.500
- Keep an eye out from Michael McKenzie.

315
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.500
Let him know we have his boat.

316
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.333
- [Carol] Will do. Sheriff.

317
00:35:42.333 --> 00:35:44.583
Got a call out at the bingo hall.

318
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:46.834
- Duty calls.

319
00:35:46.834 --> 00:35:49.792
I'll send somebody out here
to collect Michael's boat.

320
00:35:49.792 --> 00:35:51.792
You might wanna lay low for a few weeks

321
00:35:52.667 --> 00:35:54.542
and don't upset any of the locals.

322
00:35:56.291 --> 00:35:57.125
- I'm on a way.

323
00:35:59.291 --> 00:36:01.333
- Are you gonna take a report?

324
00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:03.417
- I'll take some notes when I get back.

325
00:36:03.417 --> 00:36:04.417
Have a nice evening.

326
00:36:07.834 --> 00:36:08.667
- Great.

327
00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:14.625
(motor buzzing)
(water spraying)

328
00:36:22.208 --> 00:36:25.166
(insects chirping)

329
00:36:32.291 --> 00:36:35.291
(suspenseful music)

330
00:36:39.458 --> 00:36:44.458
(motor buzzing)
(water spraying)

331
00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:54.959
(motor sputtering)

332
00:36:57.959 --> 00:37:00.625
(waves lapping)

333
00:37:14.375 --> 00:37:17.208
(water splashing)

334
00:37:25.458 --> 00:37:28.375
(insects chirping)

335
00:37:31.166 --> 00:37:34.166
(suspenseful music)

336
00:37:34.166 --> 00:37:35.000
Hi.

337
00:37:36.709 --> 00:37:37.583
Can you help me?

338
00:37:45.208 --> 00:37:50.208
Hello?

339
00:37:53.959 --> 00:37:54.792
Hello?

340
00:38:05.792 --> 00:38:07.583
(insects chirping)

341
00:38:07.583 --> 00:38:09.500
(birds shrieking)

342
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.583
(suspenseful music)

343
00:38:23.875 --> 00:38:25.792
Can you please help me?

344
00:38:37.208 --> 00:38:38.041
Hello?

345
00:39:48.792 --> 00:39:50.875
Huh!
- Jesus Christ. girl!

346
00:39:51.959 --> 00:39:56.875
- (breathes heavily) Mort. I'm sorry.

347
00:39:56.875 --> 00:39:58.834
- What the hell are you doing out here?

348
00:40:00.417 --> 00:40:01.625
- I was looking for help

349
00:40:03.083 --> 00:40:05.625
and there was this woman and I...

350
00:40:05.625 --> 00:40:08.834
- Mrs. Hunter. Forget it.

351
00:40:08.834 --> 00:40:10.291
Just be wasting your time.

352
00:40:11.458 --> 00:40:13.083
- Why is that?

353
00:40:13.083 --> 00:40:14.959
- 'Cause she's a mute.

354
00:40:14.959 --> 00:40:16.750
And she don't like company either.

355
00:40:21.917 --> 00:40:23.333
- How'd you know I was here?

356
00:40:24.583 --> 00:40:27.333
- Saw you walking into the
woods as I was passing by.

357
00:40:28.333 --> 00:40:30.208
Figure you might be in trouble is all.

358
00:40:31.875 --> 00:40:33.875
- I'm out of gas.
- Huh.

359
00:40:33.875 --> 00:40:36.583
Dangerous place to be running out of gas.

360
00:40:38.041 --> 00:40:39.166
- I can handle myself.

361
00:40:40.375 --> 00:40:42.709
- Yeah. Seems like it.

362
00:40:42.709 --> 00:40:45.625
(birds squawking)

363
00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:51.959
When was the last time
you filled this thing?

364
00:40:51.959 --> 00:40:52.959
- Two hours ago.

365
00:40:54.875 --> 00:40:57.709
- You can't burn a full tank that fast.

366
00:40:57.709 --> 00:40:59.001
- I know.

367
00:40:59.001 --> 00:41:01.250
I think someone siphoned it
while I was getting food.

368
00:41:06.375 --> 00:41:07.709
- Best be going.

369
00:41:07.709 --> 00:41:09.917
Meat don't last long in the sun. you know.

370
00:41:10.917 --> 00:41:12.500
- I'm vegetarian.

371
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.333
- What now?

372
00:41:14.458 --> 00:41:16.583
- I only eat vegetables. fruits. nuts.

373
00:41:16.583 --> 00:41:17.458
Some dairy.

374
00:41:18.792 --> 00:41:20.458
- Really? Like what?

(suspenseful music)

388
00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:48.542
- It's probably just a local teen

389
00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:50.458
trying to get your attention.

390
00:43:50.458 --> 00:43:51.500

391
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:54.250

00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:04.500
You don't have a gas leak.

409
00:45:05.834 --> 00:45:08.500
- Someone left a box with
a bloody dead rabbit in it.

410
00:45:11.792 --> 00:45:14.625
- Now why the hell would
someone do something like that?

411
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.625

I don't care what you eat

417
00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:35.208

418
00:45:35.208 --> 00:45:36.959
Why does everyone want me to leave?

419
00:45:38.208 --> 00:45:39.166

I can't talk to you about
this out in the open.
