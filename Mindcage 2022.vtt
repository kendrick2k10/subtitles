Dutch.

15
00:03:01.137 --> 00:03:03.270
Hey. you'’re not gonna
like this one. Jake.

16
00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:04.662
Trust me.

Don'’t examine the body

20

until a lead investigator
is present.

21
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:55.017
Understood. But you'’re
half an hour late.

[jingling]

23
00:04:00.327 --> 00:04:03.243
The priest said that he'’d
never seen this woman
in the church before.

24
00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:09.031
Just because he'’s a priest
don'’t mean he can't lie. Mary.

25
00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:23.524
Sage.

26
00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:25.482
Jake!

27
00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:27.354
Wait here.

28
00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:34.535
I already spoke
with Dr. Loesch.

29
00:04:34.578 --> 00:04:37.146
The Artist is right
where he should be.

30
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.367
Just wait till CSI
finish this report.

31
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.718
Can'’t start jumping
into conclusions here.

32
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:58.080
What were you guys
talking about?

33
00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:02.998
Just some old demons.

St. Joseph'’s
called again today.

37
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:33.115
The doctors are
giving him one week.
maybe two at the most.

38
00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:35.465
You should go see him.

39
00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:39.817
-I can'’t handle that.
-Mary. this is your dad.

40
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:42.167
Can we please just
not talk about this?

41
00:05:49.044 --> 00:05:51.481
[recording]
Before the biblical God
created the world.

42
00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:54.092
he first created the heavens.

43
00:05:54.136 --> 00:05:57.226
And inside the heavens.
he created the cherubim.

44
00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:59.315
the angels and the archangels.

45
00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:03.145
The archangels were essentially
the highest rank of angels

46
00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:05.756
and the chief messengers
of God himself.

47
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.371
Among those archangels
was a being known as Lucifer.

48
00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.987
[sheriff] Both women
were coated in
a resinous substance.

49
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.295
The lab confirmed
it'’s the same compound
used on previous victims.

50
00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:24.601
Previous victims?

51
00:06:24.645 --> 00:06:26.255
I think it'’s pretty safe
to assume

52
00:06:26.298 --> 00:06:28.866
-we have a copycat
on our hands here. folks.
-Sir?

53
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.434
One with a rather
intimate knowledge
of his predecessor.

54
00:06:31.478 --> 00:06:33.610
-Uh. excuse me. Sheriff?
-Yes. Detective Kelly.

55
00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:36.221
I didn'’t realize that
there were other murders
connected to this case.

56
00:06:36.265 --> 00:06:38.354
I assumed Jake filled you in.

57
00:06:39.268 --> 00:06:40.835
It must'’ve slipped his mind.

58
00:06:40.878 --> 00:06:43.403
Okay. here'’s
the Cliff'’s Notes version.

59
00:06:43.446 --> 00:06:46.971
Five years ago.
serial killer Arnaud Lefeuvre.

60
00:06:47.015 --> 00:06:51.149
aka "The Artist."
abducted and murdered six women.

61
00:06:51.193 --> 00:06:53.064
Prostitutes. sex workers.

62
00:06:54.892 --> 00:06:59.114
First. he poisoned
and preserved them using a ricin
extracted from castor beans.

63
00:06:59.157 --> 00:07:02.509
Then he'’d arrange
and decorate the corpses

64
00:07:02.552 --> 00:07:05.207
in lifelike poses
using metal frames.

65
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.776
leaving them to be found in
various places around the city.

66
00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.214
He called them
his "masterpieces."

67
00:07:12.257 --> 00:07:14.477
I do actually remember that.
It was before finals.

68
00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:16.131
so the details
are a little fuzzy.

69
00:07:16.174 --> 00:07:18.263
How did you guys
end up catching him?

70
00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:20.614
Damn fine detective work
is how.

71
00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:25.488
Done by damn fine detectives.
one of whom is sitting
right beside you.

72
00:09:08.722 --> 00:09:09.766
[siren whoops]

73
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.942

00:09:11.986 --> 00:09:14.728
[helicopter whirring]

75
00:09:14.771 --> 00:09:17.295
Hey. You might want to ease up
on the caffeine there.

76
00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:18.819
It'’s the only thing
keeping me vertical.

77
00:09:18.862 --> 00:09:21.822
Sleep hasn'’t been
very restful for me lately.

78
00:09:21.865 --> 00:09:25.652
Ah.A railroad worker
found her about an hour ago.

79
00:09:25.695 --> 00:09:28.872
[radio chatter]

80
00:09:28.916 --> 00:09:31.440
[officer] Need to get some
photographs around here.

81
00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:32.746
[Jake sighs]

82
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.771
[sheriff] The city is still
trying to recover from
what happened five years ago.

83
00:09:57.814 --> 00:10:02.253
Last thing we need
is some damn copycat
reenacting this nightmare.

84
00:10:02.297 --> 00:10:04.647
Well. you'’re preaching
to the choir. sir.

85
00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:09.652
Yeah. That'’s why I'm
considering every option.

86
00:10:09.696 --> 00:10:13.438
-No way. Absolutely not.
-Think objectively here. Jake.

87
00:10:13.482 --> 00:10:15.223
He'’s our best chance.
and you know it.

88
00:10:15.266 --> 00:10:17.965
-Nobody would do this. sir.
-Dutch has already volunteered.

89
00:10:18.008 --> 00:10:20.663
-Dutch?
-Okay. sorry. Vo--
Volunteered for what?

90
00:10:22.012 --> 00:10:23.448
The Artist.

91
00:10:24.798 --> 00:10:28.192
He wants to send Dutch
in there to see The Artist.

92
00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:33.154
Oh. well. that'’s a bold move.
um. but worth a shot.

93
00:10:33.197 --> 00:10:35.199
I think that if you
appeal to his ego.

94
00:10:35.243 --> 00:10:38.463
he would resent the fact
that another lesser artist
is copying his work.

95
00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:43.207
But I think Dutch
needs some finesse.

96
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:46.689
I would send someone else.

97
00:10:46.733 --> 00:10:49.126
Who do you have in mind.
Detective?

98
00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:53.565
Um. you'’re looking at her.

99
00:10:53.609 --> 00:10:56.307
My background is
in psychology. so...

100
00:10:56.351 --> 00:10:58.135
I'’ve read your file. Mary.

101
00:10:59.484 --> 00:11:01.791
Then what do you say?
You won'’t regret this.

102
00:11:02.618 --> 00:11:05.229
Sir. she'’s not ready for this.

103
00:11:05.273 --> 00:11:08.189
You know what?
I'’m actually very capable
of making my own decisions.

104
00:11:08.232 --> 00:11:09.669
Thank you.
I won'’t let you down.

105
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:17.546
I'’ll call Dr. Loesch.
set it up this afternoon.

106
00:11:18.068 --> 00:11:19.417
Thank you.

107
00:11:25.989 --> 00:11:28.165
I still deserve to be here.
you know.

108
00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:30.559
So don'’t even think about
monopolizing the conversation.

109
00:11:30.602 --> 00:11:32.126
I get to ask
some of the questions.

110
00:11:32.169 --> 00:11:35.999
All of them actually.
I'’m not going in with you.

111
00:11:36.043 --> 00:11:37.435
What do you mean?

112
00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:39.655
Well. The Artist is
only going to play ball

113
00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.918
if we could somehow
win his trust.

114
00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:46.880
That would be impossible
with me in the room.
considering our history.

115
00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:49.883
You mean what?
Other than the arrest? Or...

116
00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:54.191
People will remember The Artist
for the way he murdered
and preserved six women.

117
00:11:54.235 --> 00:11:56.716
But he actually took
seven lives.

118
00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:58.630
What are you talking about?

119
00:12:03.157 --> 00:12:07.204
Zeke Anderson.
My partner of 15 years.

120
00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:09.511
And a good friend.

121
00:12:09.554 --> 00:12:13.297
The night we finally
tracked down The Artist.
Zeke was killed.

122
00:12:14.908 --> 00:12:17.649
Jake. I'’m so sorry.
I... I had no idea.

123
00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:20.043
There'’s more.

124
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:27.398
That night.
we were pursuing The Artist
in a patrol car.

125
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.925
We collided.
Our vehicles flipped.

126
00:12:31.968 --> 00:12:34.362
I must have
lost consciousness
for a moment

127
00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:37.104
because I don'’t remember
Zeke getting out.

128
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.064
I just seen him standing
next to The Artist and...

129
00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:44.285
And what?

130
00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:51.161
Zeke doused himself
in gasoline

131
00:12:51.205 --> 00:12:53.903
and set himself on fire.

132
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.789
[pendant jingling]

133
00:13:30.592 --> 00:13:33.421
[Dr. Loesch] Mr. Lefeuvre is
monitored around the clock.

134
00:13:33.464 --> 00:13:38.295
He'’s actually the only resident
of a psychiatric institution
scheduled for execution.

135
00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:40.080
The court declared
him sane. right?

136
00:13:40.123 --> 00:13:43.083
Yes. I read
the mental evaluation
presented at his trial.

137
00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:44.214
And you disagree?

138
00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:46.129
My opinion'’s irrelevant.

139
00:13:46.173 --> 00:13:49.654
The Artist was transferred
here to prevent
any further self-harm.

140
00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:51.439
Self-harm?

141
00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:52.875
Slashing his wrists

142
00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:55.835
and painting on the walls
in his own blood.

143
00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:00.840
Thank you.

144
00:14:25.212 --> 00:14:26.691
[chains rattling]

145
00:14:46.233 --> 00:14:51.412
-Mr. Lefeuvre. my name is
Detective Mary Kelly.
-I know who you are.

146
00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:55.677
-Sorry. Did someone tell you
that I was coming?
-Yes. A winged friend told me.

147
00:14:57.722 --> 00:14:59.507
Well. I'’m sure someone like you

148
00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:03.511
has much better use
of their time than
conversing with birds.

149
00:15:03.554 --> 00:15:06.296
And who said anything
about a bird?

150
00:15:08.864 --> 00:15:11.301
The reason for my visit today
is actually because--

151
00:15:11.345 --> 00:15:13.521
Regarding the copycat.
no doubt.

152
00:15:13.564 --> 00:15:18.439
I presume you'’d hoped
to pick at my brain
on the matter.

153
00:15:18.482 --> 00:15:20.310
Yes. I was--

154
00:15:20.354 --> 00:15:22.878
I was hoping that you
might familiarize yourself
with the case.

155
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.054
If you saw some photos
of the victims.

156
00:15:25.098 --> 00:15:27.578
maybe you would notice
something that could help us.

157
00:15:27.622 --> 00:15:30.451
And if I notice something.
what would be in it for me?

158
00:15:30.494 --> 00:15:32.148
I just assumed
a man like you

159
00:15:32.192 --> 00:15:34.542
wouldn'’t want his legacy
tarnished by an impostor.

160
00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:36.326
That'’s semi-clever. Mary.

161
00:15:37.632 --> 00:15:41.201
I'’m afraid you'’ll have to take
a different tack with me.

162
00:15:41.244 --> 00:15:43.290
Okay. then.
I will talk to Dr. Loesch

163
00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:45.379
and see if we can get you
some better meal options.

164
00:15:45.422 --> 00:15:49.426
Two weeks before my execution.
you think I'’ll be swayed
by a new menu?

165
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.167
Extending the time
in the yard then?

166
00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:53.865
I abhor physical exertion
of any kind.

167
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.260
"No" again. I'’m afraid.

168
00:15:57.304 --> 00:15:59.828
But let'’s cut to the chase.
shall we?

169
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:03.788
I want my death sentence
commuted to life in prison.

170
00:16:03.832 --> 00:16:06.922
I'’m afraid I don't have
the authority to offer you that.

171
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:11.796
You will have once we show
the authorities something.

172
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.884
May I?

173
00:16:33.383 --> 00:16:36.212
Photographs of my art macabre

174
00:16:36.256 --> 00:16:38.562
can still be seen
on the Internet

175
00:16:38.606 --> 00:16:40.564
if one knows where to look.

176
00:16:40.608 --> 00:16:42.653
and then used
to replicate my work.

177
00:16:42.697 --> 00:16:46.788
So. the suspect could be
literally anyone.

178
00:16:46.831 --> 00:16:49.443
No. not anyone.

179
00:16:49.486 --> 00:16:51.053
The preservative
was a match.

180
00:16:51.097 --> 00:16:53.142
Your formula. it was
sealed by court order.

181
00:16:53.186 --> 00:16:55.231
It was never released
to the public.

182
00:16:55.275 --> 00:16:57.842
So. this copycat.
he knows far more
than he should.

183
00:16:57.886 --> 00:17:02.499
Maybe it was someone
that you knew from your past.
someone that you confided in?

184
00:17:04.545 --> 00:17:07.069
Could you leave
the file with me tonight?

185
00:17:07.113 --> 00:17:09.376
I'’d like to study it in detail.

186
00:17:11.117 --> 00:17:13.423
I'’ll have Dr. Loesch
bring it to your cell.

187
00:17:13.467 --> 00:17:15.556
In the meantime.
I have prepared some questions

188
00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.210
that might help refresh
your memory.

189
00:17:17.253 --> 00:17:20.474
That won'’t be necessary.
My memory is absolute.

190
00:17:20.517 --> 00:17:23.042
But I would like your help
with a different matter.

191
00:17:24.826 --> 00:17:26.871
-What is that?
-My art supplies.

192
00:17:26.915 --> 00:17:30.875
They'’ve been in
the Sheriff'’s Department storage
since my arrest.

193
00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:34.836
I want them back with permission
to use them in my cell.

194
00:17:34.879 --> 00:17:39.406
I must have
my art supplies. Mary.
or we can'’t proceed.

195
00:17:39.449 --> 00:17:41.495
It'’s nonnegotiable.

196
00:17:43.932 --> 00:17:47.501
Reminder that my hour of death
is fast approaching.

197
00:17:47.544 --> 00:17:48.589
Thank you. Mary.

198
00:17:50.721 --> 00:17:53.463
I'’ll see
what I can do.

199
00:17:53.507 --> 00:17:57.032
Should you find anything.
Dr. Loesch will provide you
access to a phone.

200
00:17:57.076 --> 00:18:02.385
Mary. are you familiar with
the archangel Samael?

201
00:18:02.429 --> 00:18:05.127
Yes. but I outgrew fairy tales.

202
00:18:14.658 --> 00:18:17.008
And then along comes Mary.

203
00:18:17.052 --> 00:18:18.749
[door opens. closes]

204
00:18:26.192 --> 00:18:30.326
He knew I was coming.
Someone on the inside must
be feeding him information.

205
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.329
What about our case?
Is he willing to help?

206
00:18:33.373 --> 00:18:36.158
-Uh... [sighs]
-What does he want?

207
00:18:36.202 --> 00:18:38.029
He wants his sentence commuted.

208
00:18:38.073 --> 00:18:40.684
-No damn way!
-Okay. He might know something.

209
00:18:40.728 --> 00:18:42.208
Don'’t be naive. Mary.

210
00:18:42.251 --> 00:18:44.166
He only said what
you wanted to hear.

211
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.387
Naive? Wow.
That was uncalled for.I'’m sorry.

212
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:50.085
But two weeks from now
that bastard'’s gonna fry.

213
00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.435
and the world'’ll be
a better place for it.

214
00:19:19.332 --> 00:19:22.509
[sighs] I think we both
could use a coffee.

215
00:19:22.552 --> 00:19:24.380
I'’m okay. Thank you.

216
00:20:00.286 --> 00:20:01.287
[gasps]

217
00:20:02.723 --> 00:20:04.681
[muttering]

218
00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:07.249
Sir. step away from
the vehicle right now.

219
00:20:07.293 --> 00:20:08.859
I'’m not gonna ask you again.

220
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.389
[knock on window]

221
00:20:18.304 --> 00:20:20.523
Mind unlocking it?Yeah. Sorry.

222
00:20:21.568 --> 00:20:23.047
Thank you.

223
00:20:49.857 --> 00:20:52.860
Not a single print.
trace of DNA.

224
00:20:53.904 --> 00:20:56.037
Same as the others
five years ago.

225
00:21:17.885 --> 00:21:19.800
[guard over intercom]
Yeah. what is it?

226
00:21:19.843 --> 00:21:23.238
Tell Dr. Loesch I need to
speak with Detective Kelly.

227
00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.901
You have two minutes.

228
00:21:44.651 --> 00:21:46.870
Did you see that tattoo
on her left shoulder?

229
00:21:46.914 --> 00:21:48.872
[Jake]
The Sigil of Baphomet?

230
00:21:48.916 --> 00:21:53.137
An inverted pentagram with
a goat'’s head at the center.

231
00:21:53.181 --> 00:21:55.923
It represents carnality.
I think.

232
00:21:57.228 --> 00:21:59.100
You'’re familiar
with that stuff?

233
00:22:00.928 --> 00:22:03.104
Well. I'’m familiar
with The Piper.

234
00:22:03.147 --> 00:22:07.543
a brothel five minutes'’ drive
from where her body was found.

235
00:22:07.587 --> 00:22:11.460
All the women working there
have tattoos just like that.

236
00:22:12.418 --> 00:22:13.462
She was a hooker. Mary.

237
00:22:14.202 --> 00:22:17.074
[cell phone vibrating]

238
00:22:18.249 --> 00:22:19.773
Detective Kelly.

239
00:22:19.816 --> 00:22:23.342
Thank you for reuniting me
with my old paints. Mary.

240
00:22:23.385 --> 00:22:24.647
Very much appreciated.

241
00:22:25.648 --> 00:22:26.997
Prove it.

242
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:28.521
Oh. I will.

243
00:22:28.564 --> 00:22:32.481
But first I want to make
something perfectly clear.

244
00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:37.530
Whatever help I provide
is for you and only for you.

245
00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:42.883
Not for your police friends.
nor anybody else. Understood?

246
00:22:44.145 --> 00:22:45.189
Understood.

247
00:22:46.756 --> 00:22:51.326
Now. the copycat'’s
latest victim.
the crucified girl...

248
00:22:52.719 --> 00:22:56.549
Do you happen to know
if the coroner
clipped her wings?

249
00:22:57.201 --> 00:22:58.638
Why would that matter?

250
00:22:58.681 --> 00:23:00.770
Because she'’s
going to need them.

251
00:23:00.814 --> 00:23:02.250
Why does she need them?

252
00:23:04.644 --> 00:23:06.559
Mr. Lefeuvre.
why does she need her wings?

253
00:23:07.516 --> 00:23:10.084
For her journey
into the afterlife.

254
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.014
Forget something?

255
00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:29.277
Yeah. I need to look
at these wings.

256
00:23:34.325 --> 00:23:36.327
What exactly did he say?

257
00:23:36.371 --> 00:23:39.200
Something about the wings.
He implied that they
were important somehow.

258
00:23:44.074 --> 00:23:46.381
There'’s something in here.
I think it'’s glued.

259
00:23:53.475 --> 00:23:54.781
[Jake] What the hell is that?

260
00:23:55.608 --> 00:23:57.087
It'’s a nail polish brush.

261
00:23:58.393 --> 00:24:00.221
This shade
was discontinued years ago.

262
00:24:00.264 --> 00:24:02.179
You could tell all that
just by looking at the cap?

263
00:24:02.223 --> 00:24:04.878
No. this is the exact shade
that I wore in high school.

264
00:24:04.921 --> 00:24:07.010
My father hated me
for wearing it.

265
00:24:07.054 --> 00:24:08.882
I'’m gonna need
to take this. okay?

266
00:24:10.013 --> 00:24:11.711
That brush was in there. sir.

267
00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:14.148
And you can confirm this?

268
00:24:14.191 --> 00:24:16.193
Still wondering about
the coroner. though.

269
00:24:17.107 --> 00:24:19.196
Dr. Reed?
What-- What about him?

270
00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.505
Well. are you aware of him
ever coming into contact
with The Artist. sir?

271
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:27.596
What if he knew the brush
was there all along
and never said anything?

272
00:24:28.771 --> 00:24:31.034
Wh-Why would he do something
like that. Jake?

273
00:24:31.078 --> 00:24:33.689
I'’ve known Dr. Reed
for five years.

274
00:24:33.733 --> 00:24:37.388
Look. I think it'’s
important that we just
keep The Artist talking.

275
00:24:37.432 --> 00:24:40.348
and I honestly think
that we need to consider
his commutation request.

276
00:24:40.391 --> 00:24:41.958
We'’re gonna need
more than a brush

277
00:24:42.002 --> 00:24:44.091
to approach the governor.
Detective.

278
00:24:44.134 --> 00:24:48.399
But if you feel you'’re onto
something. you keep going.

279
00:24:48.443 --> 00:24:50.445
You'’ll get all
the support you need.

280
00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:54.536
How about we focus on
catching the copycat
so they both can fry?

281
00:25:02.979 --> 00:25:04.764
Hey. can I ask you
something?

282
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.985
The night The Artist
was arrested.
what happened. exactly?

283
00:25:12.598 --> 00:25:17.777
Jake and Zeke were pursuing
at a high rate of speed
when Jake lost control.

284
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.170
They crashed.
Vehicle caught on fire.

285
00:25:20.214 --> 00:25:22.564
Jake made it out.
Zeke died at the scene.

286
00:25:25.436 --> 00:25:27.569
Jake suffered bad burns
on his left arm.

287
00:25:27.613 --> 00:25:29.832
but he still
made the arrest. Mary.

288
00:26:29.196 --> 00:26:31.372
[The Artist] Hello. Jacob.

289
00:26:31.415 --> 00:26:34.941
I suppose a firm handshake'’s
out of the question.

290
00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:38.509
I'’d rather shake hands
with the devil.

291
00:26:39.946 --> 00:26:41.643
Careful what you wish for.

292
00:26:41.687 --> 00:26:44.690
Do you realize how
batshit crazy you are?

293
00:26:44.733 --> 00:26:48.302
This is such misguided
thinking. Jacob.

294
00:26:48.345 --> 00:26:52.611
especially from a person
who'’s witnessed
what you'’ve witnessed.

295
00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:56.310
It'’s a pity. really.
I do take comfort
in one thing.

296
00:26:56.353 --> 00:27:00.357
Not only did Zeke
finally see the light.

297
00:27:00.401 --> 00:27:02.359
he became it.

298
00:27:02.403 --> 00:27:03.752
Oh. yeah?

299
00:27:03.796 --> 00:27:05.624
I didn'’t lay
a finger on him.

300
00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:08.539
Your partner set
himself ablaze.

301
00:27:11.934 --> 00:27:12.979
Jake.

302
00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:17.853
Jake.

303
00:27:18.854 --> 00:27:20.421
Put your firearm down.

304
00:27:21.988 --> 00:27:23.032
Now.

305
00:27:32.738 --> 00:27:34.087
We need to have a talk.

306
00:27:46.447 --> 00:27:49.102
[animal howls]

307
00:28:26.966 --> 00:28:29.577
Victim ID'’d
as Desiree Washburne. age 26.

308
00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.797
Affiliated with the sex trade.
by any chance?

309
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.625
Says she worked for several
online escort agencies.

310
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:36.540
Three dead in three days.

311
00:28:36.584 --> 00:28:38.760
I really want
to hurt this guy. Mary.

312
00:28:52.339 --> 00:28:54.254
[deputy over radio]
I need you to back up.

313

[water lapping]

315
00:29:12.228 --> 00:29:14.709
Sniffer dogs
are working the woods.

316
00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.190
and Dutch is on
foot and tire print duty.

317
00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:19.888
So. we should have
entry and exit points
in no time.

318
00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.239
Unless this guy
can fly. Yeah.

319
00:29:23.936 --> 00:29:25.111
He'’s getting reckless.

320
00:29:25.154 --> 00:29:27.330
[Jake] No. More confident.

321
00:29:33.206 --> 00:29:35.686
[jingling]

322
00:29:40.866 --> 00:29:42.998
[insect buzzing]

323
00:29:44.217 --> 00:29:45.958
There'’s something
underneath the nail.

324
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:48.961
Uh. do you have
some tweezers?

325
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.236
[insect buzzing]

326
00:30:08.937 --> 00:30:11.592
This is a needle
from an antique compass.

327
00:30:11.635 --> 00:30:15.117
My partner Zeke
had a compass
just like it.

328
00:30:15.161 --> 00:30:18.773
Never saw him without it. Mary.
Not once.

329
00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:23.169
But the day after he died.
his wife came to collect
his effects.

330
00:30:24.605 --> 00:30:26.259
No sign of the compass.

331
00:30:27.477 --> 00:30:29.088
Well. you don'’t
actually think that--

332
00:30:29.131 --> 00:30:31.655
First your nail polish.
now Zeke'’s needle.

333
00:30:32.352 --> 00:30:33.657
You tell me.

334
00:30:51.719 --> 00:30:53.852
How do you know
it'’s not an act?

335
00:30:53.895 --> 00:30:56.680
[Dr. Loesch]
He'’s suffered episodes
like this since childhood.

336
00:30:58.769 --> 00:31:00.641
Do you have any theories
as to the cause?

337
00:31:00.684 --> 00:31:05.341
At age ten.
he sustained a blood clot
on the brain after a fall.

338
00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:07.691
He spent the next two years
in a wheelchair.

339
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:10.738
The damaged regions
of his brain

340
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:13.436
were likely reaggravated
at the time of his capture.

513
00:48:21.768 --> 00:48:23.639
Is he all right?

514
00:48:23.683 --> 00:48:26.860
Pulse and breathing are normal.
He'’s fine.

515
00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:29.558
Yeah. you filed
numerous reports
to extend his stay.

516
00:48:29.602 --> 00:48:32.344
And I'’ve read your report
on his supposed self-harm.

517
00:48:32.387 --> 00:48:34.215
It'’s a little overstated.
in my opinion.

518
00:48:34.259 --> 00:48:36.522
Do you have a medical degree?

519
00:48:36.565 --> 00:48:38.785
Just a master'’s
in common sense.

520
00:48:38.828 --> 00:48:41.919
Do you want to level with me.
or should I go to
the board of directors instead?

521
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.707
[sighs]
His mind fascinates me.

522
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:50.188
I'’ve been studying him
ever since he arrived.

523
00:48:50.231 --> 00:48:52.930
At any rate. we both
want him here for now.

524
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.637
[train horn blowing]

525
00:49:19.043 --> 00:49:21.959
[over radio] Dispatch
controller Reynes SD751.

526
00:49:22.002 --> 00:49:24.439
Groundskeeper'’s truck used in
lieutenant governor'’s abduction

527
00:49:24.483 --> 00:49:26.441
was just found
outside Parrie Reserve.

528
00:49:26.485 --> 00:49:29.444
Located the vehicle.
In standby and awaiting CSI.

529
00:49:31.142 --> 00:49:35.015
[whistling]

530
00:49:35.059 --> 00:49:36.495
[knocks]

531
00:49:36.538 --> 00:49:37.887
Come in.

532
00:49:39.237 --> 00:49:40.760
These were just
dropped off.

533
00:49:40.803 --> 00:49:41.848
Thanks.

534
00:49:51.858 --> 00:49:53.903
Uh. ten minutes ago. sir.

535
00:49:54.948 --> 00:49:57.037
Yeah. yeah.
I saw the photo myself.

536
00:49:57.081 --> 00:49:59.344
I forwarded them
to your private email.

537
00:50:02.738 --> 00:50:04.697
Yeah. Yeah.

538
00:50:05.437 --> 00:50:07.091
Uh. yes.[door closes]

539
00:50:07.134 --> 00:50:09.049
I believe it'’s
our only option. actually.

540
00:50:09.093 --> 00:50:11.312
I mean. look... [scoffs]

541
00:50:11.356 --> 00:50:14.620
There'’s no guarantees here.
but time is not our friend.

542
00:50:15.925 --> 00:50:17.797
Of course. Governor.

543
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.974
[sighs] I had to inform
the governor of all our options.

544
00:50:22.106 --> 00:50:24.108
including The Artist'’s request.

545
00:50:24.151 --> 00:50:25.239
Damn it!

546
00:50:26.153 --> 00:50:27.198
You know. Jake.

547
00:50:27.241 --> 00:50:28.677
maybe you ought to think about

548
00:50:28.721 --> 00:50:30.636
sitting the rest
of this one out.

549
00:50:30.679 --> 00:50:33.247
Take a little break.
time for yourself.
It'’d be understandable.

550
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:36.903
Look. Lieutenant Governor Diaz
doesn'’t match the profile
of any of the other victims.

551
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:38.600
Are we sure that
this is our guy?

552
00:50:38.644 --> 00:50:41.386
He abandoned his truck
a couple blocks away.

553
00:50:41.429 --> 00:50:43.997
Inside. we found trace amounts
of chloroform

554
00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:45.694
and the dove feathers--
all matches.

555
00:50:45.738 --> 00:50:47.783
And then. there are these.

556
00:50:51.135 --> 00:50:56.096
Delivered to the psych institute
via courier service.
Addressed to Arnaud Lefeuvre.

557
00:50:58.229 --> 00:51:00.187
He'’s trying
to prove himself
to the master.

558
00:51:00.231 --> 00:51:01.275
Or...

559
00:51:03.451 --> 00:51:04.931
Or is he showing off?

560
00:51:05.975 --> 00:51:07.412
Boasting he can do better.

561
00:51:07.455 --> 00:51:10.110
I mean.
The Artist never targeted

562
00:51:10.154 --> 00:51:12.634
such a high-profile victim
like this. Detective.

563
00:51:12.678 --> 00:51:14.810
Regardless. I'’m convinced--

564
00:51:14.854 --> 00:51:17.639
I'’m convinced
they'’ve been communicating
since the very beginning.

565
00:51:17.683 --> 00:51:21.121
Maybe using code to get past all
the inspections. I don'’t know.

566
00:51:21.165 --> 00:51:22.818
We'’re gonna know shortly.
though.

567
00:51:22.862 --> 00:51:24.907
What are you talking about?

568
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:26.779
Um. Dr. Loesch has agreed

569
00:51:26.822 --> 00:51:29.303
to. uh. help us take
a closer look.

570
00:51:29.347 --> 00:51:31.436
No. I gave The Artist my word.

571
00:51:31.479 --> 00:51:33.742
-I'’m not gonna risk losing
his trust right now.
-He'’ll never know.

572
00:51:33.786 --> 00:51:35.222
Sure. Yeah.

573
00:51:40.488 --> 00:51:43.100
[Diaz crying]

574
00:51:53.197 --> 00:51:55.982
[crying continues]

575
00:51:57.418 --> 00:51:59.638
No. please!

576
00:51:59.681 --> 00:52:00.943
No!

577
00:52:00.987 --> 00:52:03.120
-[rain falling]
-[thunder rumbling]

578
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.873
[breathing heavily]

579
00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.140
[roaring]

580
00:52:37.458 --> 00:52:38.720
What are you doing?

581
00:52:41.245 --> 00:52:42.507
Couldn'’t sleep.

582
00:52:59.524 --> 00:53:01.917
[Dr. Loesch]
Your commutation order.
signed by the governor.

583
00:53:01.961 --> 00:53:03.876
Effective
under one condition:

584
00:53:03.919 --> 00:53:06.226
Lieutenant Governor Diaz
must be found alive.

585
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:08.968
-What is this?
-Medical checkup.

586
00:53:21.372 --> 00:53:23.156
Bullshit.

587
00:53:39.955 --> 00:53:41.609
[Dr. Loesch]
You have 45 minutes.

588
00:53:41.653 --> 00:53:42.915
Yeah. that'’s plenty.

589
00:54:10.421 --> 00:54:12.336
Something familiar
about that mug.

590
00:54:12.379 --> 00:54:14.425
Stay on task. Detective.

591
00:54:14.468 --> 00:54:15.513
[camera shutter clicks]

592
00:54:52.506 --> 00:54:55.509
He struck again.Hmm.

593
00:54:55.553 --> 00:55:01.036
I'’m revisiting
a childhood favorite.

594
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:04.605
The Ecstasy of Santa Teresa.
Bernini.

595
00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:07.521
By the way.
your friends were here.

596
00:55:07.565 --> 00:55:11.133
-It wasn'’t my idea.
-And they left empty-handed.

597
00:55:11.177 --> 00:55:13.048
I tried
to stop them.
I...

598
00:55:13.092 --> 00:55:15.181
Do you remember
I told you. Mary.

599
00:55:15.224 --> 00:55:17.401
that I would help you
but not them?

600
00:55:22.667 --> 00:55:26.801
Oh. I took all my letters
and burned them

601
00:55:26.845 --> 00:55:29.195
and flushed the ashes
down the toilet.

602
00:55:35.027 --> 00:55:38.900
But not before
committing them to memory.

603
00:55:41.816 --> 00:55:44.166
Mr. Lefeuvre. please.

604
00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:45.733
Tell me what you remember.

605
00:55:46.691 --> 00:55:48.954
You tell me
something first. Mary.

606
00:55:49.694 --> 00:55:51.913
You tell me if you believe

607
00:55:51.957 --> 00:55:55.308
that a man who is free
inside his own mind

608
00:55:55.352 --> 00:55:59.878
can truly be confined
behind the bars of a prison.

609
00:56:03.229 --> 00:56:04.796
I don'’t follow.

610
00:56:09.453 --> 00:56:11.324
The sketch.

611
00:56:15.241 --> 00:56:18.157
[dog barking][siren wailing]

612
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.941
[train horn blowing]

613
00:56:19.985 --> 00:56:21.378
[knock on door]

614
00:56:24.903 --> 00:56:27.384
Boy. let'’s go.

615
00:56:27.427 --> 00:56:28.385
Come here.

616
00:56:29.429 --> 00:56:30.865
My two o'’clock's here.

617
00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.783
Keep quiet.

618
00:57:20.045 --> 00:57:23.091
[moaning in distance]

619
00:57:37.628 --> 00:57:40.065
[moaning continues]

620
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.171
-What are you doing?
-What the hell did
I tell ya. boy?

621
00:58:00.694 --> 00:58:02.217
Why did you do that?

622
00:58:02.261 --> 00:58:04.263
No more religious shit!Stop!

623
00:58:05.307 --> 00:58:07.309
-Ain'’t nothing
but brainwashing.
-Stop!

624
00:58:07.353 --> 00:58:10.878
I won'’t tolerate it.But I like
the old masters'’ style.

625
00:58:10.922 --> 00:58:14.882
You wanna draw something.
draw a dog or a real
live person. for once!

626
00:58:21.585 --> 00:58:24.805
[siren wailing]

627
00:58:28.635 --> 00:58:31.159
In the subsequent
two years.

628
00:58:32.465 --> 00:58:35.337
I was confined
to a wheelchair.

629
00:58:36.295 --> 00:58:37.514
But...

630
00:58:40.212 --> 00:58:44.259
[loudly] Jake. you know
all about that. don'’t you?

631
00:58:44.999 --> 00:58:46.435
Jake!

632
00:58:46.479 --> 00:58:48.525
Come out. come out
wherever you are.

633
00:58:54.008 --> 00:58:58.273
Mr. Lefeuvre.
I am sure your childhood
was very difficult.

634
00:58:58.317 --> 00:59:00.493
but time is of
the essence right now.

635
00:59:00.537 --> 00:59:03.365
I need you to talk to me
about the copycat.

636
00:59:03.409 --> 00:59:04.453
Please.

637
00:59:05.454 --> 00:59:08.109
I'’m nearly
out of sculpting clay.

638
00:59:09.502 --> 00:59:12.679
I'’ll replenish that.
Please talk to me
about the copycat.

639
00:59:16.074 --> 00:59:18.772
The gentleman you seek

640
00:59:18.816 --> 00:59:21.601
is a forger
of Renaissance paintings.

641
00:59:21.645 --> 00:59:23.864
primarily religious in theme.

642
00:59:23.908 --> 00:59:28.695
I used to frequent
a quaint little antique store
called Langdon & Sons.

643
00:59:28.739 --> 00:59:31.219
And they.
more than occasionally.

644
00:59:31.263 --> 00:59:34.614
displayed some of
his counterfeits there. Mary.

645
00:59:42.883 --> 00:59:43.928
[door closes]

646
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:18.310
We'’re not open yet.

647
01:00:18.353 --> 01:00:20.181
We'’re not customers.

648
01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:22.793
-Well. you just can'’t
barge in here---
-Without a warrant?

649
01:00:22.836 --> 01:00:25.883
[clock ticking]

650
01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:36.850
Jake.

651
01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:43.378
What about it?When The Artist referenced
a painting. he made a...

652
01:00:43.422 --> 01:00:44.989
Who painted this?

653
01:00:45.946 --> 01:00:47.905
He wished to remain anonymous.

654
01:00:47.948 --> 01:00:51.169
I paid him in cash
and I never saw him again.

655
01:00:51.212 --> 01:00:53.214
We'’re gonna need
to seize it as evidence.

656
01:01:03.529 --> 01:01:05.357
Hey. when did you get
a search warrant?

657
01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.752
I didn'’t.
I always keep a blank one handy.

658
01:01:08.795 --> 01:01:11.363
No one ever
reads them.
[laughs]

659
01:01:16.107 --> 01:01:17.717
[gunshot]

660
01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:20.459
If you knock on
the devil'’s door. he'll answer.

661
01:01:20.502 --> 01:01:22.156
It'’s the freak who
broke into my house!

662
01:01:23.941 --> 01:01:25.420
Mary. wait!

663
01:01:28.119 --> 01:01:29.163
Wait!

664
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:59.454
[homeless person]
You should'’ve
listened to me. Mary!

665
01:02:02.066 --> 01:02:03.676
Put your hands above your head.

666
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.286
-It'’s too late now. Mary.
-Back off!

667
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.202
-I will shoot. I will shoot.
-Pull that trigger. Mary!

668
01:02:08.246 --> 01:02:10.552
You don'’t have the guts
to pull that trigger!

669
01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:12.598
I tried to warn you.

670
01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:16.254
No!

671
01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:18.473
[thud]

672
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:27.047
[sheriff] Javier Salazar.
the man who assaulted you.

673
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:30.137
was employed at the institute
until last year.

674
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:32.226
Worked there as a nurse.

675
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:35.534
We'’re comparing his DNA
with the salivary DNA
found on the envelope

676
01:02:35.577 --> 01:02:38.755
that contained
Lieutenant Governor Diaz'’s
photos.

677
01:02:38.798 --> 01:02:43.020
What we know already. he was
in daily direct contact
with The Artist.

678
01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:46.371
He was the RN in charge
of drug administration.

679
01:02:46.414 --> 01:02:48.939
I'’ve already checked
Salazar'’s record.

680
01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:51.289
He was let go
due to his mental condition.

681
01:02:51.332 --> 01:02:53.247
Acute bipolarism.
according to Dr. Loesch.

682
01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:56.381
Look. he sounds psychotic.
so it'’s really hard to believe

683
01:02:56.424 --> 01:02:58.687
that he'’s capable
of such elaborate murders.

684
01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:00.820
We won'’t know for sure
until the DNA comes back.

685
01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:03.127
but I'’m pretty damn confident
he was our guy. Mary.

686
01:03:05.216 --> 01:03:07.827
We still have
a missing woman. sir.

687
01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:10.743
The lab'’s running
soil traces
on Salazar'’s shoes.

688
01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:13.006
We want to pinpoint
exactly where he'’s been.

689
01:03:14.312 --> 01:03:16.488
Any results on that painting?

690
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:35.594
There.

691
01:03:37.248 --> 01:03:39.990
Thumb. Must have brushed
the wet paint.

692
01:03:40.033 --> 01:03:41.774
[thunder rumbling]

693
01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:44.690
[rain falling]

694
01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:47.214
I offered Zeke
a full confession.

695
01:03:47.258 --> 01:03:49.303
and all I asked for
in return

696
01:03:49.347 --> 01:03:51.828
was for him to sit
for his portrait.

697
01:03:51.871 --> 01:03:54.743
In fact. I would like
to make the same offer to you.

698
01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:58.399
Of course.
I'’m perfectly capable
of drawing from memory.

699
01:03:58.443 --> 01:04:00.619
Would you care
to sit for me?

700
01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:04.710
[chattering]

701
01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:07.104
[radio chatter][phone rings]

702
01:04:09.062 --> 01:04:11.064
Got a print on the painting.
Detective.

703
01:04:11.108 --> 01:04:13.240
Did you run it through AFIS.
confirming it'’s Salazar's?

704
01:04:13.284 --> 01:04:15.112
Belongs to a woman. actually.

705
01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:18.942
We had her print on file
from a prostitution arrest
years ago.

706
01:04:18.985 --> 01:04:21.466
Name and address?It'’s all in there. Detective.

707
01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:23.947
Hey.What'’s going on?

708
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.644
I'’ll bring you
up to speed en route.

709
01:04:25.687 --> 01:04:27.211
Take some backup.

710
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:32.781
[sirens wailing]

711
01:04:57.328 --> 01:05:00.026
[sirens whoop][radio chatter]

712
01:05:01.245 --> 01:05:06.250
[doves cooing]

713
01:05:35.714 --> 01:05:39.370
[chattering]

714
01:05:44.766 --> 01:05:46.290
You might want to see this.

715
01:05:59.694 --> 01:06:02.828
No. it can'’t be her.
This body'’s been here
for far too long.

716
01:06:02.871 --> 01:06:06.005
This level of desiccation
would take years.

717
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:08.051
[insect buzzing]

718
01:06:08.094 --> 01:06:10.879
[Mary] He must have been testing
the preservative on her.

719
01:06:10.923 --> 01:06:13.273
Turned this whole apartment
into an art studio

720
01:06:13.317 --> 01:06:15.580
to measure the rate
of decomposition.

721
01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:23.631
I wouldn'’t touch that
if I were you.

722
01:06:23.675 --> 01:06:25.198
Poison?

723
01:06:25.242 --> 01:06:27.461
It'’s probably ricin
extracted from castor beans.

724
01:06:27.505 --> 01:06:30.551
Same toxin he used
on the other girls.

725
01:06:30.595 --> 01:06:32.771
A single drop
can kill a horse.

726
01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.692
So. the Bosch
wasn'’t a Bosch at all.

727
01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:43.912
but a forgery
painted right here.

728
01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:55.272
Gotta be crawling
with Salazar'’s DNA.

729
01:06:55.315 --> 01:06:56.882
I don'’t think so.

730
01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:04.150
Welcome to
The Artist'’s home. Jake.

731
01:07:05.412 --> 01:07:07.371
He'’s playing games with us.

732
01:07:09.199 --> 01:07:11.244
He turned his own mother
into a guinea pig.

733
01:07:13.377 --> 01:07:15.640
[cell phone vibrates]

734
01:07:16.945 --> 01:07:18.904
[Mary] Salazar'’s DNA--

735
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:21.080
Not a match.

736
01:07:46.453 --> 01:07:48.325
[siren wails]

737
01:07:56.811 --> 01:08:00.163
You knew that painting would
take us to the apartment.

738
01:08:00.206 --> 01:08:02.252
and you wanted us
to find your mother.

739
01:08:02.295 --> 01:08:06.647
-Why?
-Because I wanted you to
understand who I truly am.

740
01:08:06.691 --> 01:08:09.911
I have read
every single public record

741
01:08:09.955 --> 01:08:12.784
with your name on it.
including the court cases.

742
01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:15.526
I have a very good grasp
on who you are.

743
01:08:15.569 --> 01:08:18.746
Did you ever think there may
be truths about me. Mary.

744
01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:21.662
that are not contained
in those files?

745
01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:24.491
This all began when
I was working on a piece

746
01:08:24.535 --> 01:08:26.493
called
The Inferno Landscape.

747
01:08:26.537 --> 01:08:28.756
And then I heard a voice.

748
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.933
and that was the voice
of the archangel Samael.

749
01:08:31.977 --> 01:08:33.544
Why am I listening to this?

750
01:08:33.587 --> 01:08:36.764
And that voice opened
my ears and my eyes

751
01:08:36.808 --> 01:08:38.897
to who I really am.

752
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.423
You'’ve given me nothing
on the copycat.

753
01:08:43.467 --> 01:08:45.164
I'’ll let the governor know.

754
01:08:45.208 --> 01:08:48.515
Too bad for you.
I can tell you exactly
where to find him.

755
01:08:49.473 --> 01:08:51.214
Why should I believe you?

756
01:08:51.257 --> 01:08:53.085
What choice do you have?

757
01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:57.089
By the time I finish.
you'’ll have his exact address.

758
01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.351
I promise you.

759
01:08:59.222 --> 01:09:00.745
Finish what?

760
01:09:00.788 --> 01:09:01.833
Sculpting.

761
01:09:03.226 --> 01:09:04.270
Sculpting you.

762
01:09:05.489 --> 01:09:07.665
You are a sick man.

763
01:09:07.708 --> 01:09:09.710
Because you don'’t
realize something.

764
01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:13.061
If the lieutenant governor dies.
you'’re going to the chair.

765
01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.414
And you don'’t care.

766
01:09:18.458 --> 01:09:20.199
What are you doing?

767
01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:21.244
Waiting.

768
01:09:23.071 --> 01:09:25.117
You can'’t be serious
right now.

769
01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:27.337
Deathly.

770
01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:31.515
Make yourself comfortable.

771
01:09:33.865 --> 01:09:35.519
If you want that address.

772
01:09:41.307 --> 01:09:44.702
Here'’s the deal.
You have ten minutes
and not a second more.

773
01:09:44.745 --> 01:09:47.792
At the end of those ten minutes.
you'’re giving me the address.

774
01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:50.360
Agreed. Shall we?

775
01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:04.765
The human form
is a divine work

776
01:10:04.809 --> 01:10:07.115
of grace and proportion.

777
01:10:07.159 --> 01:10:09.640
but the same cannot
be said. however.

778
01:10:09.683 --> 01:10:11.468
for the human mind.

779
01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:15.559
which is weak and corruptible.

780
01:10:15.602 --> 01:10:18.649
To create a sculpture
is to solve a mystery.

781
01:10:19.824 --> 01:10:23.349
Every contour
a destination.

782
01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:25.525
every gaze a road map.

783
01:10:26.439 --> 01:10:29.747
every expression and hollow

784
01:10:30.617 --> 01:10:32.967
the hidden address
of the soul.

785
01:10:34.447 --> 01:10:37.842
Did you know. Mary.
that when I first
glimpse a person.

786
01:10:37.885 --> 01:10:41.149
their story is already
revealed to me?

787
01:10:41.193 --> 01:10:45.371
And that yours is
the tale of a young woman

788
01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:49.462
plagued by terrible scars
from her childhood.

789
01:10:50.376 --> 01:10:52.117
We all have old wounds.

790
01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:57.601
Wounds are
the trademark of warriors.
wouldn'’t you agree?

791
01:10:59.733 --> 01:11:02.258
And God could have
healed your wounds.

792
01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:06.958
But you turn your back
on him. Why. Mary?

793
01:11:13.094 --> 01:11:15.053
My father.

794
01:11:15.096 --> 01:11:17.316
A man you haven'’t seen
in many years.

795
01:11:18.535 --> 01:11:21.668
who you still. in fact.
refuse to see.

796
01:11:21.712 --> 01:11:25.281
And all he wants to do
is to be able to say
goodbye to you.

797
01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:32.505
You'’re not guessing anymore.
How do you know that?

798
01:11:32.549 --> 01:11:34.855
Why won'’t you see him. Mary?

799
01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.947
-You don'’t know
what he put me through.
-What did he put you through?

800
01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:42.907
Did he abuse you
as my mother
abused me?

801
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:44.474
No. no.

802
01:11:44.517 --> 01:11:46.954
You and I
are not the same.

803
01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:50.218
That man.
he never touched me. He...

804
01:11:52.046 --> 01:11:54.527
He would put his hand
on the stove. and...

805
01:11:55.789 --> 01:11:58.226
he would say. "This is what
happens to flesh in hell."

806
01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:00.185
And I couldn'’t stop him.

807
01:12:02.927 --> 01:12:05.625
And you can smell
his burning skin?

808
01:12:08.019 --> 01:12:09.760
I still can.

809
01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:14.852
So. he made you responsible for
the torment he was suffering.

810
01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:20.771
That is truly the stuff
of nightmares. Mary.

811
01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.166
Tell me about them.

812
01:12:27.778 --> 01:12:29.345
They begin with falling.

813
01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:32.260
Falling where?

814
01:12:35.263 --> 01:12:36.700
Into flames.

815
01:12:40.051 --> 01:12:44.751
The burning was so real
that I could still feel it
when I woke up in the morning.

816
01:12:44.795 --> 01:12:47.711
Do you still have
those nightmares. Mary?

817
01:12:50.627 --> 01:12:51.889
No.

818
01:12:53.717 --> 01:12:56.284
The moment
I stopped believing in hell.
they went away.

819
01:12:56.328 --> 01:12:58.722
and my father couldn'’t
scare me with them anymore.

820
01:12:58.765 --> 01:13:02.334
But that made him try
all the harder.
didn'’t it. Mary?

821
01:13:03.204 --> 01:13:05.424
[Mary] He said I was possessed.

822
01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:09.297
That I needed help.
And that'’s when he started
dragging me to confession.

823
01:13:09.341 --> 01:13:12.126
And that'’s where you
first seduced him?

824
01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:14.259
Right in
the confessional booth?

825
01:13:15.869 --> 01:13:19.090
Seduced who?The priest who took
your confessions.

826
01:13:19.133 --> 01:13:22.615
Father Dale.
The one who now
shares your bed.

827
01:13:26.445 --> 01:13:28.665
Who are you talking to?
Who told you this?

828
01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:31.842
Do you know why he
shares your bed. Mary?

829
01:13:32.495 --> 01:13:33.844
Do you?

830
01:13:33.887 --> 01:13:36.455
I don'’t need to answer
these questions.

831
01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:38.326
Would you like me
to tell you why?

832
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:39.415
Stop! Stop!

833
01:13:42.853 --> 01:13:44.463
We fell in love.

834
01:13:44.507 --> 01:13:45.595
Love?

835
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:49.381
You fell in love?

836
01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.949
He chose
a different life with me.

837
01:13:53.516 --> 01:13:55.866
So. it was true love.
correct?

838
01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.171
Yes.Uh-huh.

839
01:13:57.215 --> 01:13:59.391
And when you tell
yourself that. Mary.

840
01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.349
-do you believe it?
-Yes.

841
01:14:01.393 --> 01:14:03.351
You actually
believe that?Yes.

842
01:14:03.395 --> 01:14:06.006
-I don'’t think you do.
-Yes. I do.

843
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:10.010
Or didn'’t you.
in fact. do it merely
to spite your father?

844
01:14:13.884 --> 01:14:17.365
Thank you
for sitting for me. Mary.

845
01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.457
It'’s very much
appreciated.

846
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:24.460
It'’s your turn.

847
01:14:25.939 --> 01:14:27.550
The address. Now.

848
01:14:27.593 --> 01:14:31.902
The address
is 1522 Lola Court.

849
01:14:32.903 --> 01:14:34.513
Was that loud enough?

850
01:14:34.557 --> 01:14:37.298
Or shall I repeat it
for your colleagues?

851
01:14:37.342 --> 01:14:40.345
1522 Lola Court.
Come on. people! Let'’s go!

852
01:14:40.388 --> 01:14:43.435
[sirens wailing]

853
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:50.007
Mary. you'’re
forgetting something.

854
01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:55.882
This is for you.

855
01:15:04.021 --> 01:15:06.284
And always remember.
Mary.

856
01:15:06.327 --> 01:15:10.506
that the truth
is only ever found
within ourselves.

857
01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:21.647
[door closes]

858
01:15:22.561 --> 01:15:23.780
Need a lift?

859
01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:27.523
Why didn'’t you go
with the others?

860
01:15:27.566 --> 01:15:30.917
I figured those apes
could handle an arrest
without me for once.

861
01:15:30.961 --> 01:15:33.180
Yeah. but it'’s our case.
One of us should'’ve--

862
01:15:33.224 --> 01:15:35.792
I'’d rather be here
right now.

863
01:15:35.835 --> 01:15:37.489
Come on. Mary.

864
01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:53.897
[Diaz breathing shakily. crying]

865
01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:55.594
[Diaz] Oh. my God.

866
01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:58.336
[sobbing] God.

867
01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:06.910
[doves cooing]

868
01:16:11.784 --> 01:16:13.525
[radio chatter]

869
01:16:23.535 --> 01:16:27.626
I just-- I don'’t understand
how he knows all those things
about my life.

870
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:30.716
It'’s stuff that I've only ever
told one other person. and...

871
01:16:35.286 --> 01:16:38.071
No. No. it can'’t be.

872
01:16:38.115 --> 01:16:40.683
He'’s just putting things
in my head. right?

873
01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.909
"Truth is found within oneself."
That'’s what he said.

874
01:16:49.953 --> 01:16:51.955
Who said what?

875
01:16:57.351 --> 01:16:59.397
Wait. what are you doing?

876
01:17:09.276 --> 01:17:13.150
Archibald. have you lost
your mind? [gasps]

877
01:17:14.847 --> 01:17:16.370
Son of a bitch.

878
01:17:27.077 --> 01:17:29.470
-I'’ll be damned.
-265 Opal Street.

879
01:17:29.514 --> 01:17:32.125
It'’s the right address.
Do you know where this is?

880
01:17:32.169 --> 01:17:33.213
Yeah.

881
01:17:55.453 --> 01:17:56.672
[sighs]

882
01:18:03.896 --> 01:18:05.942
[animal calling]

883
01:18:17.214 --> 01:18:19.782
[animals calling]

884
01:18:33.578 --> 01:18:35.362
[hinge creaks]

885
01:18:45.764 --> 01:18:47.418
Anyone home?

886
01:19:03.564 --> 01:19:05.305
What the hell
is all this?

887
01:19:06.829 --> 01:19:10.615
It'’s me. It's...
It'’s my entire life. It's--

888
01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:17.535
"Infernum."

889
01:19:19.058 --> 01:19:21.321
I-It'’s Latin for "hell."

890
01:19:24.063 --> 01:19:27.110
Come on. Mary.
We really need
to call this in.

891
01:19:27.153 --> 01:19:29.721
Go ahead. I'’m just gonna
take a few pictures.

892
01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:31.157
I'’ll catch up. okay?

893
01:19:50.002 --> 01:19:51.395
[sighs]

894
01:19:51.438 --> 01:19:54.093
Car 252 to Dispatch.

895
01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:01.144
[cell phone vibrating]

896
01:20:01.187 --> 01:20:03.886
Hi. you'’ve reached Dale.
Leave a message.

897
01:20:03.929 --> 01:20:07.759
[distant crying]

898
01:20:11.763 --> 01:20:13.504
[crying continues]

899
01:20:14.244 --> 01:20:15.723
[floorboard creaks]

900
01:20:21.686 --> 01:20:24.210
[breathing heavily]

901
01:20:29.346 --> 01:20:30.826
[hinge creaks]

902
01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:33.263
[doves cooing]

903

[clattering]

904
01:20:49.975 --> 01:20:53.674
[distant crying continues]

905
01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:10.648
Governor Diaz?

906
01:21:10.691 --> 01:21:12.911
[Diaz] Yes. Who are you?

907
01:21:12.955 --> 01:21:15.348
I'’m the one who's gonna
get you out of here.Okay.

908
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:19.439
-How do you unlock this?
-The devil man. He has the key.

909
01:21:19.483 --> 01:21:21.093
-Where is he?
-He'’s right there.

910
01:21:27.273 --> 01:21:29.449
[crying. breathing shakily]

911
01:21:35.978 --> 01:21:37.675
[breathing shakily]

912
01:21:37.718 --> 01:21:40.286
Step out with your hands
above your head.

913
01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:41.244
Slowly.

914
01:21:43.376 --> 01:21:44.638
Mary.

915
01:21:50.122 --> 01:21:51.341
Jake?

916
01:21:52.385 --> 01:21:55.040
Well. yes. And no.

917
01:21:56.824 --> 01:22:00.002
[as The Artist]
I promised to help you
find the killer. Mary.

918
01:22:00.045 --> 01:22:01.917
And here he is.

919
01:22:02.787 --> 01:22:04.180
Jake.
what'’s wrong with you?

920
01:22:04.223 --> 01:22:06.443
Oh. Jake'’s not here
right now.

921
01:22:06.486 --> 01:22:11.970
No prison can hold a man
who'’s free inside himself.
Remember. Mary?

922
01:22:12.014 --> 01:22:14.146
[breathing shakily]

923
01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:15.800
Lefeuvre?

924
01:22:15.843 --> 01:22:17.584
That'’s right.

925
01:22:17.628 --> 01:22:20.413
[breathing shakily]

926
01:22:25.723 --> 01:22:29.161
You still need to hear
the rest of my story. Mary.

927
01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:36.386
[children laughing.
chattering]

928
01:23:05.284 --> 01:23:08.984
Mother destroyed
all my art books.

929
01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:12.683
forcing me to find
new subjects to draw.

930
01:23:24.173 --> 01:23:27.828
That'’s when I discovered
my power.

931
01:23:27.872 --> 01:23:31.615
After capturing
someone'’s likeness
in a drawing.

932
01:23:33.051 --> 01:23:38.448
I can leave my own body
and temporarily enter theirs.

933
01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:49.459
I kept it a secret
for many years.

934
01:23:49.502 --> 01:23:51.548
fearing it to be a curse.

935
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:56.770
Until the archangel Samael

936
01:23:56.814 --> 01:23:58.250
revealed it was a gift...

937
01:23:58.294 --> 01:23:59.599
[gun clicks]

938
01:23:59.643 --> 01:24:01.949
...bestowed upon me

939
01:24:01.993 --> 01:24:04.387
when the spirit
entered my body.

940
01:24:06.258 --> 01:24:08.608
I was born an angel. Mary.

941
01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.959
Angel of Death.

942
01:24:12.003 --> 01:24:14.049
[Mary murmuring]

943
01:24:14.092 --> 01:24:16.138
Come back. come back.
come back.

944
01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:18.357
Jake. please.
Jake. come back. Please.

945
01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:19.576
No. no. no!

946
01:24:19.619 --> 01:24:20.664
[grunts]

947
01:24:30.587 --> 01:24:33.459
[breathing heavily]

948
01:24:37.681 --> 01:24:39.726
I have honored the contract.

949
01:24:40.988 --> 01:24:43.121
Lieutenant governor lives.

950
01:24:44.644 --> 01:24:47.430
And the killer
will soon be dead.

951
01:24:48.561 --> 01:24:51.042
And I couldn'’t have done it
without you.

952
01:24:56.613 --> 01:24:59.006
Now finish the job. Mary.

953
01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:00.878
One more.

954
01:25:02.445 --> 01:25:03.794
right here.

955
01:25:05.665 --> 01:25:07.145
Don'’t be afraid.

956
01:25:08.015 --> 01:25:10.192
[breathing heavily]

957
01:25:18.591 --> 01:25:19.984
[as himself] Mary?

958
01:25:20.027 --> 01:25:21.986
[Jake gasping]

959
01:25:22.813 --> 01:25:23.857
Where am I?

960
01:25:30.037 --> 01:25:31.169
I'’m so sorry.

961
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:34.390
Jake. I'’m so sorry.

962
01:25:36.696 --> 01:25:38.176
Jake. it was you.

963
01:25:51.058 --> 01:25:53.278
You were the copycat
the whole time.

964
01:25:53.322 --> 01:25:55.062
[breathing shakily]

965
01:25:56.542 --> 01:25:58.588
You gotta stop him. Mary.

966
01:26:01.678 --> 01:26:02.722
[gasps]

967
01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:11.557
[sirens wailing]

968
01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:18.390
Now. you'’re free to join
your old partner. Jacob.

969
01:26:20.697 --> 01:26:22.089
Go.

970
01:26:28.531 --> 01:26:29.793
Go.

971
01:26:33.449 --> 01:26:35.146
The city can breathe easier

972
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:38.584
thanks to Detective Mary Kelly.
whose courageous actions

973
01:26:38.628 --> 01:26:42.414
ended the killing spree
of her former partner.
Jake Doyle.

974
01:26:42.458 --> 01:26:44.634
and saved the life
of Lieutenant Governor Diaz.

975
01:26:44.677 --> 01:26:46.984
[clears throat]You. uh. wanted
to see me. sir?

976
01:26:47.027 --> 01:26:51.858
I know it'’s not
the happy ending
we all wanted. Detective.

977
01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:56.472
But you did save
that woman'’s life.

978
01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:00.780
Psychologists are saying
that Jake suffered from

979
01:27:00.824 --> 01:27:04.697
some kind of dissociative
identity-type psychosis.

980
01:27:04.741 --> 01:27:08.092
possibly triggered from the--
from the first case.

981
01:27:08.135 --> 01:27:11.530
That'’s why he thought
he was The Artist.

982
01:27:13.184 --> 01:27:14.881
Well.
they are the experts.

983
01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:19.712
What do you think.
Mary?

984
01:27:20.583 --> 01:27:22.193
You were there that night.

985
01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:29.156
What I think won'’t
bring him back. sir.

986
01:27:34.814 --> 01:27:37.426
The Jake I knew
wasn'’t capable of this.

987
01:27:38.427 --> 01:27:40.777
And I knew Jake
for a long time.

988
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:50.787
I just can'’t wrap
my head around it.

989
01:27:55.531 --> 01:27:57.837
Whoever believes in me

990
01:27:57.881 --> 01:28:01.319
should not abide
in the darkness.

991
01:28:04.148 --> 01:28:05.758
May the Lord

992
01:28:05.802 --> 01:28:09.675
look kindly on you.

993
01:28:09.719 --> 01:28:11.111
Elias Kelly.

994
01:28:12.374 --> 01:28:16.465
In the name of the Father
and the Son

995
01:28:16.508 --> 01:28:18.858
and the Holy Spirit.

996
01:28:18.902 --> 01:28:20.251
Amen.

997
01:28:29.913 --> 01:28:32.350
I'’m glad
you saw your father
before he passed.

998
01:28:33.569 --> 01:28:35.005
Yeah. Me too.

999
01:28:41.141 --> 01:28:44.623
Um...
can you give me a minute?

1000
01:28:45.755 --> 01:28:46.799
Yeah.

1001
01:28:49.062 --> 01:28:51.978
-[doves cooing]
-[whistling]

1002
01:28:55.242 --> 01:28:56.635
Dr. Loesch.

1003
01:28:58.289 --> 01:29:01.814
[as The Artist]
Let the earth rest lightly
on him. Mary Kelly.

1004
01:29:05.688 --> 01:29:08.081
Did you know my father.
Dr. Loesch?

1005
01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:10.997
No. I just wanted
to see you.

1006
01:29:11.041 --> 01:29:13.304
No visits. No calls.

1007
01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:15.132
Not even a letter.
Mary Magdalene?

1008
01:29:18.483 --> 01:29:20.746
I was wondering
when you'’d show up.

1009
01:29:20.790 --> 01:29:23.227
I missed you too. Mary.

1010
01:29:25.838 --> 01:29:29.102
You never intended to kill
the lieutenant governor.
did you?

1011
01:29:29.146 --> 01:29:30.756
Very perceptive.

1012
01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:34.586
I was only giving her boss
extra incentive to sign.

1013
01:29:34.630 --> 01:29:35.674
[grunts]

1014
01:29:35.718 --> 01:29:36.849
No. Mary.

1015
01:29:38.155 --> 01:29:40.592
It'’s you who's going
to be next.

1016
01:29:41.767 --> 01:29:43.943
Why the games?

1017
01:29:43.987 --> 01:29:46.424
You could have
just sketched a guard
and wheeled yourself out.

1018
01:29:46.468 --> 01:29:48.470
You could have escaped
at any time.

1019
01:29:48.513 --> 01:29:52.212
To spend the rest of my life
hunted like an animal?

1020
01:29:52.256 --> 01:29:54.040
I think not.

1021
01:29:54.084 --> 01:29:56.347
Escape has never been
my intent. Mary.

1022
01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:59.350
In fact. there couldn'’t be
a more ideal place for me

1023
01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:02.571
to continue
my necessary work.

1024
01:30:04.181 --> 01:30:06.966
As I'’ll soon be
returning the favor

1025
01:30:07.837 --> 01:30:10.753
when I purify your soul.
Mary.

1026
01:30:10.796 --> 01:30:13.103
Today would have been the day.

1027
01:30:13.146 --> 01:30:16.846
Of my execution.
Ironic. isn'’t it?

1028
01:30:16.889 --> 01:30:19.457
I think a little bit more
than you realize.

1029
01:30:19.501 --> 01:30:21.894
And what'’s that
supposed to imply?

1030
01:30:21.938 --> 01:30:24.157
I have a question for you.

1031
01:30:24.201 --> 01:30:26.856
Did you happen
to sketch Dr. Loesch
with a black pencil?

1032
01:30:26.899 --> 01:30:29.467
-I'’m sorry?
-A black charcoal pencil.

1033
01:30:29.511 --> 01:30:32.731
It was part of the art supplies
that were delivered
to your cell yesterday.

1034
01:30:32.775 --> 01:30:35.865
I think you might have
thought that they were
from some deranged fan.

1035
01:30:35.908 --> 01:30:37.606
but no. they were from me.

1036
01:30:37.649 --> 01:30:39.346
See. I noticed
you had this habit

1037
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:42.785
of chewing on the ends
of your pencils.

1038
01:30:42.828 --> 01:30:45.875
Just added a couple drops
of your special ingredient.

1039
01:30:45.918 --> 01:30:48.268
the same one that you used
on your own mother.

1040
01:30:48.312 --> 01:30:49.356
You'’re bluffing.

1041
01:30:50.967 --> 01:30:53.360
I probably should have filed it
with evidence. but...

1042
01:30:55.101 --> 01:30:58.235
I guess Jake taught me
a few bad habits after all.

1043
01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:00.672
Have a good day.

1044
01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:15.470
[grunts]

1045
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:19.212
[exhales]

1046
01:31:19.256 --> 01:31:22.302
[labored breathing]

1047
01:31:24.827 --> 01:31:26.611
[groaning]

1048
01:31:28.570 --> 01:31:30.876
[gagging]

1049
01:31:32.399 --> 01:31:34.489
[gasping]

1050
01:31:34.532 --> 01:31:36.360
[coughing]

1051
01:31:36.403 --> 01:31:40.059
[grunting. coughing]

1052
01:31:40.103 --> 01:31:41.539
[clattering]

1053
01:31:44.411 --> 01:31:47.066
[breathing heavily. gasps]

1054
01:31:53.551 --> 01:31:55.727
[breathing heavily]

1055
01:32:00.384 --> 01:32:02.995
[groans]

1056
01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:35.680
You know. I was
thinking about that trip
you wanted to take.

1057
01:32:35.724 --> 01:32:38.291
To Rome?Yeah. let'’s do it.

1058
01:34:03.115 --> 01:34:07.163
["Eclipse the World"

1059
01:34:12.211 --> 01:34:16.259
