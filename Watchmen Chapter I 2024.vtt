10
00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:29.029

00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:06.055

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.057
<i>They had a choice.</i>

33
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:10.059
<i>They could have followed

34
00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.715
<i>Decent men who believed in
a day's work for a day's pay.</i>

35
00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.762
<i>Instead. they followed
the droppings of lechers
and communists.</i>

36
00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:20.461
<i>Now the whole world stands

37
00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:22.985

<i>And all of a sudden nobody can
think of anything to say.</i>

40
00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:32.864
Hmm. that's quite a drop.

41
00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:35.432
So what do you think
happened here?

42
00:03:35.606 --> 00:03:37.608
Door chain was fastened
on the inside.

43
00:03:37.782 --> 00:03:40.089
Busting it down would
take two guys.

44
00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:42.483
<i>Or one guy on serious drugs.</i>

45
00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:45.616
<i>I saw the body.</i>

46
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.229
<i>This Blake guy looked beefy
enough to protect himself.</i>

47
00:03:49.403 --> 00:03:51.187
<i>Muscles like a weight lifter.</i>

48
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:54.234
<i>He would've put up
some kind of fight.</i>

49
00:03:54.408 --> 00:03:58.629
Maybe it was a couple
of Knot-Tops and they just
overpowered him.

50
00:04:02.372 --> 00:04:07.290
Background report said
he's been doing overseas
diplomatic work for years...

51
00:04:07.464 --> 00:04:09.945
Lotta classy expense
account living.

52
00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.730
Maybe he just got soft.

53
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.389
He don't look
too soft in this photo.

54
00:04:19.563 --> 00:04:21.522
Wonder how he got that scar.

55
00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:24.264
Oh. he's shaking hands
with Vice President Ford here.

56
00:04:24.438 --> 00:04:26.222
I think we can rule him out
as a suspect.

57
00:04:26.396 --> 00:04:27.919
Oh. ha ha.

58
00:04:28.093 --> 00:04:30.922
That'd be funny if we had
any better leads to go on.

59
00:04:31.923 --> 00:04:33.490
I mean. what is this?

60
00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:35.144
<i>A little money stolen.</i>

61
00:04:35.318 --> 00:04:37.668
<i>but no way is this
a straight burglary.</i>

62
00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:42.717
Ah. somebody really
had it in for this guy.

63
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:44.414
How else did he go
outta the window?

64
00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:47.678
Maybe he tripped against it.

65
00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:53.597
That's strong glass. man.

66
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.120
<i>You'd have to be thrown.</i>

67
00:04:59.211 --> 00:05:01.126
Ground floor comin' up.

68
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:10.788
Y'know. this could be
just a simple burglary.

69
00:05:10.962 --> 00:05:13.225
Crazy things happen
in a city this size.

70
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.054
They don't all need motives.

71
00:05:16.228 --> 00:05:17.621
So you're saying...

72
00:05:17.795 --> 00:05:21.016
Let's not raise too much dust
over this one.

73
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.585
We don't need any
masked avengers cutting in.

74
00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:26.151
Oy! Here we go!

75
00:05:26.326 --> 00:05:28.589
You take this vigilante
stuff too seriously.

76
00:05:28.763 --> 00:05:30.982
Ever since the
Keene Act passed in '77.

77
00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:34.334
only the government
sponsored weirdos are active.
They don't interfere.

78
00:05:34.508 --> 00:05:36.597
Rorschach never retired!

79
00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:39.251
Even after him and his buddies
fell outta grace.

80
00:05:39.426 --> 00:05:41.732
He's still out there somewhere.

81
00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:43.821
He's crazier
than a snake's armpit

82
00:05:43.995 --> 00:05:46.476
and wanted on
two counts murder one.

83
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.174
We've got a cozy
little homicide here.

84
00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.481
If Rorschach gets involved.

85
00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:54.702
we'll be up to our butts
in corpses.

86
00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:29.187
Huh.

87
00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:45.769
Hmm.

88
00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:57.215
So there I was
in the supermarket

89
00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:59.304
buying dog food
for old Phantom here...

90
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.742
I turn the corner and WHAM!

91
00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:04.527
I bump into
the Screaming Skull.

92
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:06.050
You remember him?

93
00:08:06.224 --> 00:08:08.444
I heard you mention him...

94
00:08:08.618 --> 00:08:10.664
Put him away a dozen times.

95
00:08:10.838 --> 00:08:12.883
He'd reformed
and turned to Jesus.

96
00:08:13.057 --> 00:08:14.363
Married. two kids.

97
00:08:14.537 --> 00:08:16.800
We traded addresses. Nice guy.

98
00:08:19.977 --> 00:08:22.763
Oh. Hollis. almost midnight.
I outta go.

99
00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:25.113
Oh. sure. Dan.
lost track of the time there.

100
00:08:25.287 --> 00:08:27.158
talking about
all that old stuff.

101
00:08:27.332 --> 00:08:29.421
You must be bored as hell.

102
00:08:29.596 --> 00:08:31.423
You know better than that.

103
00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:33.904
These Saturday night
beer sessions are what
keep me going.

104
00:08:36.603 --> 00:08:37.995
You know. it was a cryin' shame

105
00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.694
they put you youngsters out
to grass in '77.

106
00:08:40.868 --> 00:08:43.218
You were a better Nite Owl
than I ever was.

107
00:08:43.392 --> 00:08:46.874
Hollis. we both know that's
bullshit. But thank you anyway.

108
00:08:47.048 --> 00:08:48.963
Hey. watch the language!

109
00:08:49.137 --> 00:08:51.226
This is the left hook
that floored Captain Axis. remember?

110
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.056
Goodnight!
Don't forget to lock up
and take care of yourself.

111
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.145
You too. Danny. God bless.

112
00:09:01.584 --> 00:09:02.411
Hmm.

113
00:09:37.925 --> 00:09:39.448
Where you goin' pig?

114
00:09:39.622 --> 00:09:42.016
- The party's right here!
- Oh yeah!

115
00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:46.629
Hit us with more
of those Katie's. Derf!

116
00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:48.239
Yeah. I'm comin' down
already. man.

117
00:09:48.413 --> 00:09:51.199
You never
could keep it up.

118
00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:56.334
Hey. let's go break
some shit. huh!

119
00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.904
- I wanna get crazy!
- Aw. yeah!

120
00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:03.080
Call up your boys. Derf!

121
00:10:03.254 --> 00:10:04.908
Fire it up!

122
00:10:41.728 --> 00:10:42.990
Hello. Daniel.

123
00:10:43.164 --> 00:10:45.775
- Rorschach?
- Got hungry waiting.

124
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:47.255
Helped myself to some beans.

125
00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:48.517
Hope you don't mind.

126
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:52.913
No. no of course I don't mind.

127
00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:54.175
You want me to heat
those up for you?

128
00:10:54.349 --> 00:10:56.438
No need. Fine like this.

129
00:10:58.005 --> 00:11:01.051
So... long time no see.

130
00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:02.618
How've you been keeping?

131
00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:05.534
Out of prison. so far.
Take a look at this.

132
00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:11.627
This stain...
is that bean juice or--

133
00:11:11.801 --> 00:11:13.803
Yeah... human bean juice.

134
00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:15.675
Badge belonged to the Comedian.

135
00:11:15.849 --> 00:11:17.633
Blood too. He's dead.

136
00:11:17.807 --> 00:11:19.504
Wait. The Comedian?

137
00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.550
Investigated
a routine homicide.

138
00:11:21.724 --> 00:11:23.639
Victim named Edward Blake.

139
00:11:23.813 --> 00:11:25.989
Found the costume
in Blake's wardrobe.

140
00:11:26.163 --> 00:11:27.774
Seems he was the Comedian.

141
00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:30.037
Somebody threw him
out of a window.

142
00:11:32.648 --> 00:11:36.043
Um. maybe we should
talk about this
down in my workshop.

143
00:11:37.131 --> 00:11:38.785
Right down this way.

144
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:41.222
You haven't been
down here in a while.

145
00:11:41.396 --> 00:11:44.312
Neither have you. Lots of dust.

146
00:11:53.451 --> 00:11:54.714
Oh!

147
00:11:54.888 --> 00:11:58.065
Uh. listen...
about the Comedian.

148
00:11:58.239 --> 00:12:00.937
might it have been
just an ordinary
burglary or something?

149
00:12:01.111 --> 00:12:03.331
Maybe the killer didn't
even know who Blake was.

150
00:12:03.505 --> 00:12:06.247
An ordinary burglar?
Kill the Comedian?

151
00:12:06.421 --> 00:12:07.596
Ridiculous.

152
00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:13.863
Well. I hear he'd been working
for the government since '77.

153
00:12:14.037 --> 00:12:17.606
knocking over Marxist republics
in South America.

154
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.304
- Maybe this was
a political killing.
- Maybe.

155
00:12:20.478 --> 00:12:24.047
Or maybe someone's
picking off costumed heroes.

156
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:26.746
Don't you think that's
maybe a little paranoid?

157
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.618
That what they're
saying about me now?
That I'm paranoid?

158
00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:32.142
The Comedian was active
for 40 years.

159
00:12:32.316 --> 00:12:34.231
Men make a lot of enemies
in that time.

160
00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:36.581
How's your friend Hollis Mason
these days?

161
00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:38.801
Hollis? What does he--

162
00:12:38.975 --> 00:12:40.847
They were both Minutemen.
when Blake was 16

163
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.110
and Hollis
was the first Nite Owl.

164
00:12:43.284 --> 00:12:46.243
Hollis said some bad things
about the Comedian
in that book he wrote.

165
00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:47.810
I don't like what
you're implying.

166
00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:50.030
Hollis is an old man.
and he's my friend.

167
00:12:50.204 --> 00:12:52.032
If you're thinking of going
over there and scaring him--

168
00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:55.252
Implying nothing.
only an observation.

169
00:12:55.426 --> 00:12:56.906
I just wanted to let you know.

170
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.213
in case someone's
gunning for masks.

171
00:13:11.442 --> 00:13:12.748
Better go now.

172
00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:14.881
Things to do.

173
00:13:15.055 --> 00:13:16.578
The tunnel will bring you out
to a warehouse two blocks
north--

174
00:13:16.752 --> 00:13:18.319
I remember.

175
00:13:18.493 --> 00:13:21.409
Used to come here often
back when we were partners.

176
00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:24.020
Those were great times. Rorschach.

177
00:13:24.194 --> 00:13:25.935
- Whatever happened to them?
- You quit.

178
00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:48.740
We want cops! No more costumes!

179
00:13:48.915 --> 00:13:52.396
Listen. you little punks!
You better get back
in your rat holes!

180
00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.399
I got riot gas.
I got rubber bullets--

181
00:13:55.573 --> 00:13:57.793
- There's no need for this!
- Fuck you. Owl!

182
00:13:57.967 --> 00:14:00.143
The police strike is being
negotiated right now!

183
00:14:00.317 --> 00:14:01.928
You vigilantes belong in jail!

184
00:14:02.102 --> 00:14:04.321
My son's a police officer.
you freaks!

185
00:14:04.495 --> 00:14:05.670
Call yourself a Comedian?

186
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.238
More like pig and rapist!

187
00:14:08.412 --> 00:14:09.500
Okay. that does it!

188
00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:13.635
Oh my God.
he just shot him!

189
00:14:13.809 --> 00:14:17.595
God. look. I'm sorry.
You haven't left us any choice.

190
00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:21.034
This stuff is dangerous.
Please clear the streets!

191
00:14:21.208 --> 00:14:22.078
Look at 'em!

192
00:14:23.384 --> 00:14:25.299
Run. you suckers!

193
00:14:25.473 --> 00:14:26.822
This is a nightmare!

194
00:14:26.996 --> 00:14:28.389
The whole country's
erupting like this.

195
00:14:28.563 --> 00:14:30.521
How long can we keep this up?

196
00:14:30.695 --> 00:14:34.569
My contacts say
Senator Keene's act is
gonna shut us all down.

197
00:14:34.743 --> 00:14:38.138
Until then. we're society's
only protection.

198
00:14:39.574 --> 00:14:41.010
Protection? From who?

199
00:14:41.184 --> 00:14:43.621
From themselves.

200
00:14:43.795 --> 00:14:47.582
What-- What happened
to the American dream?

201
00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:51.107
It came true.
You're looking at it.

202
00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:54.589
Now let's really put
these jokers through
some changes.

203
00:15:14.348 --> 00:15:18.918
<i>Rorschach's Journal.
October 13th. 1985.</i>

204
00:15:19.092 --> 00:15:24.140
<i>Slept all day. Awakened
by landlady complaining
about the smell.</i>

205
00:15:24.314 --> 00:15:27.796
<i>She has five children
by five different fathers.</i>

206
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:29.929
<i>I'm sure she cheats on welfare.</i>

207
00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:37.458
<i>Soon it will be dark.</i>

208
00:15:41.897 --> 00:15:45.248
<i>On Friday night.
a Comedian died in New York.</i>

209
00:15:45.422 --> 00:15:49.774
<i>Somebody knows why.
Somebody knows.</i>

210
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.820
Get lost. you creep!

211
00:15:51.994 --> 00:15:53.953
<i>I believe I shall
take my exercise.</i>

212
00:16:07.053 --> 00:16:10.230
Huh. Rorschach!
Hey. how you doin'. fella?

213
00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:12.493
I'm fine. Happy Harry.
Yourself?

214
00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:16.976
I'm fine! I'm fine!
Just fine and... uh...

215
00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:22.111
Oh. God.
please don't kill anybody.

216
00:16:22.285 --> 00:16:24.722
Guy went sidewalk diving
Friday night.

217
00:16:24.896 --> 00:16:26.855
I don't think he was alone
when it happened.

218
00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:30.337
His name was Edward Blake.
Friend of mine.

219
00:16:30.511 --> 00:16:31.773
You hear that?

220
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.731
He's got friends.

221
00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:35.429
Must've changed his deodorant!

222
00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:45.047
I... I didn't mean
anything. I--

223
00:16:46.831 --> 00:16:49.704
I've just broken
this gentleman's little finger.

224
00:16:49.878 --> 00:16:51.227
Who killed Edward Blake?

225
00:16:53.882 --> 00:16:56.493
Who killed Edward Blake?

226
00:16:57.842 --> 00:16:59.366
And his index finger.

227
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.368
- Who killed Edward Blake?
- We don't know.

228
00:17:01.542 --> 00:17:05.111
Please. God. leave him alone!
We don't know!

229
00:17:06.677 --> 00:17:09.071
No. No. no. no. no. no. no!

230
00:17:12.074 --> 00:17:16.252
<i>Nobody knew anything.
Feeling slightly depressed.</i>

231
00:17:16.426 --> 00:17:21.388
<i>I leave the human cockroaches
to discuss their heroin
and child pornography.</i>

232
00:17:21.562 --> 00:17:25.174
<i>I have business
with a better class of person.</i>

233
00:17:26.436 --> 00:17:29.874
The Comedian is dead? Why?

234
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:34.357
You're supposed to be
the world's smartest man.
Veidt. You tell me.

235
00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:36.881
I never claimed to be
anybody special. Rorschach.

236
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:41.408
I just have some
over-enthusiastic P.R. men.

237
00:17:41.582 --> 00:17:43.236
Perhaps it was
a political killing.

238
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.760
- Maybe the Soviets...
- Dreiberg said the same.

239
00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:47.544
America has Dr. Manhattan.

240
00:17:47.718 --> 00:17:50.373
Reds would never
dare antagonize us.

241
00:17:50.547 --> 00:17:53.159
I think we've got
a mask-killer.

242
00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:55.465
The Comedian had
plenty of other
political enemies.

243
00:17:55.639 --> 00:17:57.554
even discounting the Russians.

244
00:17:57.728 --> 00:17:59.426
The man was practically a Nazi.

245
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.211
He stood up for his country.
Never let anyone retire him.

246
00:18:02.385 --> 00:18:04.387
Never cashed in
on his reputation.

247
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:07.695
Never set up a company
selling posters and diet books

248
00:18:07.869 --> 00:18:09.349
and toy soldiers
based on himself.

249
00:18:09.523 --> 00:18:12.178
Never became a prostitute.

250
00:18:12.352 --> 00:18:16.095
If that makes him a Nazi.
you might as well call me
a Nazi too.

251
00:18:17.357 --> 00:18:18.140
Rorschach...

252
00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:21.578
I know we were never friends.

253
00:18:21.752 --> 00:18:24.146
but even so
you're being unfair.

254
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.192
Nobody retired me.

255
00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:28.716
I chose to quit adventuring
and go public

256
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.719
two years before
the police strike made
the Keene Act necessary.

257
00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:33.677
Yes. Good timing.

258
00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:36.158
I came here to warn you
about the mask-killer

259
00:18:36.332 --> 00:18:39.640
so you don't end up
the smartest man
in the morgue.

260
00:18:39.814 --> 00:18:41.816
But I guess there's
worse things to end up as.

261
00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:45.124
Be seeing you.

262
00:18:48.214 --> 00:18:49.128
Sure.

263
00:18:49.954 --> 00:18:50.955
Have a nice day.

264
00:18:57.919 --> 00:19:03.272
Now. I want to thank everyone
for coming to the first meeting
of the Crimebusters.

265
00:19:03.446 --> 00:19:06.188
For those who know me
only as Captain Metropolis.

266
00:19:06.362 --> 00:19:08.538
the name's Nelson Gardner.

267
00:19:08.712 --> 00:19:10.366
Call me Nelson.

268
00:19:12.629 --> 00:19:15.154
As you know. this country
hasn't had an organization

269
00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:18.026
of masked adventurers
in over 20 years.

270
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.507
since the Minutemen
were disbanded.

271
00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:23.510
Specialized law enforcement
is standing still.

272
00:19:23.684 --> 00:19:26.121
Crime isn't.

273
00:19:26.295 --> 00:19:29.298
New social evils emerge
every day:

274
00:19:29.472 --> 00:19:33.259
promiscuity. drugs.
campus subversion. you name it.

275
00:19:33.433 --> 00:19:36.653
But. by banding together
as Crimebusters.

276
00:19:36.827 --> 00:19:38.438
- we can make a--
- Bullshit.

277
00:19:39.395 --> 00:19:41.180
We're all livin' in 1966

278
00:19:41.354 --> 00:19:43.660
while you're
still stuck in '49.

279
00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:45.314
This is all about
you getting old

280
00:19:45.488 --> 00:19:48.230
but still wanting to play
cowboys and Indians.

281
00:19:48.404 --> 00:19:50.841
Th--That's-- That is not true.

282
00:19:51.015 --> 00:19:54.062
Uh. no reason to just
throw the idea away.

283
00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:56.760
Me and Rorschach have
made great headway
into the gang problem

284
00:19:56.934 --> 00:19:58.675
by pooling our efforts.

285
00:19:58.849 --> 00:20:01.939
But a group this size seems
more like a publicity exercise.

286
00:20:02.113 --> 00:20:03.463
Too big and unwieldy.

287
00:20:03.637 --> 00:20:05.378
That's just
an organizational problem.

288
00:20:05.552 --> 00:20:07.206
With the right person
coordinating the group--

289
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.166
Oh. and who would that be?
Any ideas. Ozzy?

290
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.170
I mean. you are the smartest
man in the world. right?

291
00:20:15.344 --> 00:20:18.086
It doesn't take
a genius to see that
America has problems

292
00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.827
that need tackling.

293
00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:21.698
And it takes a moron to think
they're small enough

294
00:20:21.872 --> 00:20:23.700
for clowns like you guys
to handle.

295
00:20:23.874 --> 00:20:26.181
None of the world's problems
are insurmountable.

296
00:20:26.355 --> 00:20:30.620
What's going down
in this world. you got no idea!

297
00:20:35.973 --> 00:20:38.367
Believe me.

298
00:20:38.541 --> 00:20:41.196
You people hear Moloch's back
in town and you think.

299
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.373
"Oh. boy! Let's gang up
and bust him!"

300
00:20:44.547 --> 00:20:47.115
Like that matters.

301
00:20:47.289 --> 00:20:49.030
It doesn't mean squat!

302
00:20:49.204 --> 00:20:53.426
In 30 years the nukes are
gonna be flying like maybugs...

303
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.602
My map!

304
00:20:55.776 --> 00:21:00.998
And Ozzy here is gonna be
the smartest man on the cinder.

305
00:21:03.044 --> 00:21:04.872
Jon. I'd like to go home now.

306
00:21:05.046 --> 00:21:06.308
- Please.
- Listen. Nelson.

307
00:21:06.482 --> 00:21:08.702
maybe this isn't
the best idea...

308
00:21:08.876 --> 00:21:11.270
No. wait. don't leave.

309
00:21:11.444 --> 00:21:13.141
Somebody has to do it...

310
00:21:13.315 --> 00:21:15.404
Somebody has to save the world!

311
00:21:57.968 --> 00:22:00.754
<i>Meeting with Veidt
left bad taste in mouth.</i>

312
00:22:00.928 --> 00:22:02.973
<i>He is pampered and decadent.</i>

313
00:22:03.147 --> 00:22:06.455
<i>betraying even his own shallow.
liberal affectations.</i>

314
00:22:06.629 --> 00:22:08.979
<i>Dreiberg just as bad.</i>

315
00:22:09.153 --> 00:22:11.765
<i>A flabby failure whimpering
in his basement.</i>

316
00:22:11.939 --> 00:22:14.637
<i>Why are there so few
of the Minutemen left active.</i>

317
00:22:14.811 --> 00:22:18.293
<i>healthy and without
personality disorders?</i>

318
00:22:18.467 --> 00:22:21.296
<i>The first Nite Owl runs
an auto repair shop.</i>

319
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.734
<i>Captain Metropolis
was decapitated
in a car crash.</i>

320
00:22:27.737 --> 00:22:31.001
<i>The first Silk Specter
is a bloated. aging whore...</i>

321
00:22:31.175 --> 00:22:34.178
<i>Dying in a California
rest resort.</i>

322
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:37.138
<i>Mothman's in an asylum
up in Maine.</i>

323
00:22:37.312 --> 00:22:39.836
<i>The Silhouette retired
in disgrace.</i>

324
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:44.188
<i>Murdered six weeks later
by a minor adversary
seeking revenge.</i>

325
00:22:44.363 --> 00:22:46.234
<i>Dollar Bill got shot.</i>

326
00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:48.932
<i>Hooded Justice went missing.</i>

327
00:22:49.106 --> 00:22:50.934
<i>The Comedian is dead.</i>

328
00:22:51.108 --> 00:22:53.589
<i>And now I must tell
the indestructible man</i>

329
00:22:53.763 --> 00:22:55.809
<i>that someone
plans to murder him.</i>

330
00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:04.905
Good evening. Rorschach.

331
00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:06.733
Good evening. Dr. Manhattan.

332
00:23:11.346 --> 00:23:13.304
What're you doing here.
Rorschach?

333
00:23:13.479 --> 00:23:15.655
Aren't you still wanted
by the police?

334
00:23:15.829 --> 00:23:17.570
Good evening. Miss Jupiter.

335
00:23:17.744 --> 00:23:19.136
That's Juspeczyk.

336
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.922
Jupiter was my mother's
publicity name.

337
00:23:22.096 --> 00:23:23.532
Apologies.

338
00:23:23.706 --> 00:23:26.013
Came to warn you both
and bring bad news.

339
00:23:26.187 --> 00:23:27.797
The Comedian is dead.

340
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:30.800
Yes. He and I are the only
two extranormal operatives

341
00:23:30.974 --> 00:23:34.369
employed by the government.
so I was informed at once.

342
00:23:34.543 --> 00:23:36.850
You don't seem too concerned
about Blake's death.

343
00:23:37.024 --> 00:23:40.941
A live body and a dead body
contain the same number
of particles.

344
00:23:41.115 --> 00:23:43.552
Structurally there's no
discernible difference.

345
00:23:43.726 --> 00:23:47.426
Life and death
are unquantifiable abstracts.

346
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.036
Why should I be concerned?

347
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:51.255
Besides. Blake was a monster.

348
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.736
You know he tried to rape
my mother when they were
both Minutemen?

349
00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.304
I'm not here to speculate
on the moral lapses

350
00:23:56.478 --> 00:23:59.220
of men who died
in their country's service.
I came to warn--

351
00:23:59.394 --> 00:24:02.441
Moral lapses?
He broke her ribs! He--

352
00:24:05.095 --> 00:24:07.228
Jon. get this creep
out of here.

353
00:24:08.925 --> 00:24:10.710
You seem to be
upsetting Laurie.

354
00:24:10.884 --> 00:24:12.276
I think you ought to go.

355
00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:13.843
With respect. Dr. Manhattan.

356
00:24:14.017 --> 00:24:15.932
I believe someone
is eliminating masks.

357
00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:18.152
I warned Veidt and Dreiberg
and I intend--

358
00:24:18.326 --> 00:24:20.154
I said I think you ought to go.

359
00:24:20.328 --> 00:24:21.590
Not before I've had my--

360
00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:24.463
Say.

361
00:24:30.991 --> 00:24:31.992
Hmm.

362
00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:40.304
He's gone. Are you still upset?

363
00:24:41.784 --> 00:24:42.611
Jon?

364
00:24:44.657 --> 00:24:47.877
Hey. I was thinking.

365
00:24:48.051 --> 00:24:50.924
I must be really on edge
to let a maggot like Rorschach
get to me like that.

366
00:24:51.098 --> 00:24:52.229
Maybe we--

367
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.495
Maybe I could use a night out.

368
00:24:57.974 --> 00:25:00.063
Rorschach mentioned
Dan Dreiberg.

369
00:25:00.237 --> 00:25:02.152
Haven't seen him in years.

370
00:25:02.326 --> 00:25:04.764
Maybe I'll call him up.
ask him to dinner.

371
00:25:06.635 --> 00:25:08.724
If you don't mind. that is.

372
00:25:08.898 --> 00:25:09.986
Of course not.

373
00:25:16.819 --> 00:25:19.518
<i>It is October. 1985.</i>

374
00:25:19.692 --> 00:25:21.476
<i>I am close to locating
a gluino.</i>

375
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:24.261
<i>which would completely validate
super symmetrical theory.</i>

376
00:25:29.484 --> 00:25:32.008
<i>It is May. 1971.</i>

377
00:25:40.016 --> 00:25:43.672
<i>Having been asked to intervene
in Vietnam by President Nixon.</i>

378
00:25:43.846 --> 00:25:47.328
<i>I am deployed alongside
Edward Blake. the Comedian.</i>

379
00:25:49.199 --> 00:25:52.246
<i>I have never met anyone
so deliberately amoral.</i>

380
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:56.816
<i>What Vietnam implies
about the human condition.</i>

381
00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.384
<i>few humans will permit
themselves to understand.</i>

382
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:02.604
<i>But Blake is different.</i>

383
00:26:02.778 --> 00:26:04.693
<i>He understands perfectly.</i>

384
00:26:05.825 --> 00:26:07.174
<i>And he doesn't care.</i>

385
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:13.397
The average
Vietnamese doesn't give
a damn who won this war.

386
00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:16.487
But it means plenty
to the US of A.

387
00:26:16.662 --> 00:26:20.970
If we'd lost. I think
it might've driven
the country a little crazy.

388
00:26:21.144 --> 00:26:23.756
Thanks to you. we didn't.

389
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.627
Yet you sound so bitter.

390
00:26:25.801 --> 00:26:29.022
You have some strange attitudes
toward life and war.

391
00:26:29.196 --> 00:26:30.589
Strange?

392
00:26:30.763 --> 00:26:32.634
Once you figure out
everything's a joke.

393
00:26:32.808 --> 00:26:35.637
being a Comedian
is the only thing
that makes sense.

394
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:37.160
The charred villages.

395
00:26:37.334 --> 00:26:40.599
the boys with necklaces
of human ears...

396
00:26:40.773 --> 00:26:43.079
these are part of the joke?

397
00:26:43.253 --> 00:26:45.560
Never said it was a good joke.

398
00:26:45.734 --> 00:26:48.650
I'm just playing
along with the gag.
Same as him.

399
00:26:48.824 --> 00:26:53.002
First press helicopter
into Saigon since
the cease fire.

400
00:26:53.176 --> 00:26:56.005
Oh. he's got the next election
in the bag.

401
00:26:56.179 --> 00:26:59.618
Me. I'm taking
the first chopper out.

402
00:27:00.444 --> 00:27:02.490
I hate this place.

403
00:27:02.664 --> 00:27:07.538
The temperature. the smell.
this rotten. cheap bourbon--

404
00:27:07.713 --> 00:27:09.976
- Mr. Eddie?
- Oh. God.

405
00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:14.763
Now war is over.
I must talk to you.

406
00:27:14.937 --> 00:27:17.374
Nothing to talk about.
I'm leaving.

407
00:27:17.548 --> 00:27:19.115
And... and what of me?

408
00:27:19.289 --> 00:27:23.380
I cannot just walk away
from what grow in my belly.

409
00:27:23.554 --> 00:27:24.947
- I cannot forget!
- Too bad.

410
00:27:25.121 --> 00:27:26.906
because that's what
I intend to do.

411
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.385
Forget you.

412
00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:30.257
your cruddy little country.
all of it.

413
00:27:33.434 --> 00:27:35.349
I do not think so.

414
00:27:35.523 --> 00:27:38.526
I think you remember me
and my country.

415
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.921
You remember
as long as you live.

416
00:27:45.576 --> 00:27:46.795
My face!

417
00:27:48.275 --> 00:27:50.843
Filthy. stinking.

418
00:27:51.017 --> 00:27:52.627
- worthless...
- Blake. don't--

419
00:27:55.543 --> 00:27:58.807
Medic. Gotta find
a goddamn medic.

420
00:27:58.981 --> 00:28:00.374
She was pregnant.

421
00:28:00.548 --> 00:28:02.071
- You gunned her down.
- That's right.

422
00:28:02.245 --> 00:28:03.551
And you know what?

423
00:28:03.725 --> 00:28:05.031
You watched me.

424
00:28:05.205 --> 00:28:06.989
You coulda turned
the gun into steam.

425
00:28:07.163 --> 00:28:10.384
the bullets into mercury
or the bottle into snowflakes!

426
00:28:10.558 --> 00:28:12.560
You coulda teleported her
to goddamn Australia.

427
00:28:12.734 --> 00:28:15.171
but you didn't lift a finger.

428
00:28:15.345 --> 00:28:17.478
You let it happen.

429
00:28:17.652 --> 00:28:19.219
I've watched you.

430
00:28:19.393 --> 00:28:22.570
You don't really give a damn
about human beings.

431
00:28:22.744 --> 00:28:23.832
You never cared
about Janey Slater

432
00:28:24.006 --> 00:28:26.139
even before you ditched her.

433
00:28:26.313 --> 00:28:31.187
Soon you won't be
interested in Sally Jupiter's
little gal. either.

434
00:28:31.361 --> 00:28:33.407
You're drifting
outta touch. Doc.

435
00:28:34.277 --> 00:28:35.975
God help us all.

436
00:28:53.644 --> 00:28:55.298
- Hello?
<i>- H-hello?</i>

437
00:28:55.472 --> 00:28:57.779
<i>- Dan? Uh. this is--</i>
- Laurie?

438
00:28:57.953 --> 00:28:59.563
Laurie Juspeczyk!

439
00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:03.829
<i>Hey. it's been awhile.
How-- How are you?</i>

440
00:29:07.136 --> 00:29:10.183
<i>Rorschach's Journal. 11:30 p.m.</i>

441
00:29:10.357 --> 00:29:13.055
<i>Yesterday a Comedian died
in New York.</i>

442
00:29:13.229 --> 00:29:15.144
<i>Nobody cares but me.</i>

443
00:29:15.318 --> 00:29:18.234
<i>Are they right? Is it futile?</i>

444
00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:20.149
<i>Soon there will be war.</i>

445
00:29:20.323 --> 00:29:24.066
<i>Millions will perish and burn
in sickness and misery.</i>

446
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.722
<i>Why does one death matter
against so many?</i>

447
00:29:27.896 --> 00:29:30.246
<i>Because there is good.
and there is evil.</i>

448
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:34.033
<i>and evil must be punished.</i>

449
00:29:34.207 --> 00:29:39.168
<i>Even in the face of Armageddon
I shall not compromise on this.</i>

450
00:29:39.342 --> 00:29:43.042
<i>But there are so many
deserving of retribution.</i>

451
00:29:43.216 --> 00:29:44.565
<i>and so little time.</i>

452
00:29:52.268 --> 00:29:54.618
Oh wow. look at the time.
It's getting pretty late.

453
00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:57.926
Oh. I'm in
no hurry to get back.

454
00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.667
The government
only keeps me around

455
00:29:59.841 --> 00:30:02.017
so Jon stays relaxed and happy.

456
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.022
Is. uh. everything okay
with you two?

457
00:30:07.196 --> 00:30:09.503
Fine. Couldn't be better.

458
00:30:12.985 --> 00:30:17.250
It's just. I'm 35. Dan.

459
00:30:17.424 --> 00:30:22.037
and all I can think is...
what have I done with my life?

460
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:24.561
I've spent
eight years semi-retired.

461
00:30:24.735 --> 00:30:28.435
preceded by 10 years
running around
in a stupid costume

462
00:30:28.609 --> 00:30:31.394
because my stupid mother
wanted me to.

463
00:30:31.568 --> 00:30:35.877
Short skirt. neckline going
all the way down to my navel...

464
00:30:36.051 --> 00:30:40.447
- so dreadful.
- Oh. yeah... dreadful.

465
00:30:40.621 --> 00:30:43.406
The Keene Act
was the best thing that
ever happened to us.

466
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:48.107
Yeah. you're probably right.

467
00:30:55.766 --> 00:30:57.681
Hey. remember that guy

468
00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.683
who used to pretend to be
a super-villain

469
00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:01.163
so he could get beaten up?

470
00:31:01.337 --> 00:31:04.514
Oh. um...
Captain Carnage!

471
00:31:04.688 --> 00:31:07.126
Yes!

472
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.432
Ya know. I caught him
running out of a jewelers.

473
00:31:09.606 --> 00:31:10.956
I didn't know
what his racket was.

474
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:12.871
so I start hitting him
and I'm thinking.

475
00:31:13.045 --> 00:31:15.438
"Jeez. he's breathing
awfully hard."

476
00:31:15.612 --> 00:31:17.571
"Maybe he has asthma."

477
00:31:17.745 --> 00:31:19.051
He tried that
with me too.

478
00:31:19.225 --> 00:31:21.357
but I'd heard about him.
so I walked away.

479
00:31:21.531 --> 00:31:24.012
He followed me down the street
saying "Punish me!"

480
00:31:24.186 --> 00:31:26.145
I'm saying. "No. get lost!"

481
00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:29.235
What ever
happened to him?

482
00:31:29.409 --> 00:31:30.889
He--
he pulled that on Rorschach

483
00:31:31.063 --> 00:31:33.065
and Rorschach dropped him
down an elevator shaft.

484
00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:39.288
Oh. God.
that's not funny.

485
00:31:39.462 --> 00:31:43.336
No. no. I guess not...

486
00:31:45.512 --> 00:31:46.687
That felt good.

487
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:51.170
Not a lot of laughs around
these days.

488
00:31:51.344 --> 00:31:53.694
Well. what do you expect?

489
00:31:54.695 --> 00:31:56.131
The Comedian is dead.

490
00:32:08.448 --> 00:32:10.189
Oh. look at her.

491
00:32:10.363 --> 00:32:14.106
<i>pretty as a picture
and still keeping her figure.</i>

492
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.066
So what brings you
to the city of the dead?

493
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.895
Being lazy isn't
a terminal condition. mother.

494
00:32:21.069 --> 00:32:23.463
so spare me
the city of the dead crap.

495
00:32:23.637 --> 00:32:24.464
Brought you some flowers.

496
00:32:24.638 --> 00:32:27.423
Oh. big spender!

497
00:32:27.597 --> 00:32:28.511
So where's Jon?

498
00:32:30.122 --> 00:32:33.777
He had to go to some
official funeral.

499
00:32:33.952 --> 00:32:36.215
<i>Made him put on pants
and everything.</i>

500
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:39.870
<i>I didn't feel like going
so he transported me
here to California.</i>

501
00:32:40.045 --> 00:32:42.482
Teleporting
always makes me sick.

502
00:32:42.656 --> 00:32:44.832
It's Eddie Blake's funeral.
isn't it?

503
00:32:45.006 --> 00:32:47.443
I saw in the paper.
He got murdered.

504
00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:50.446
Poor Eddie.

505
00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.274
How can you say "Poor Eddie"
after he almost--

506
00:32:52.448 --> 00:32:55.364
What happened was 40 years ago.

507
00:32:56.365 --> 00:32:57.976
It's history.

508
00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:02.154
Gettin' old. you get
a different perspective.

509
00:33:02.328 --> 00:33:05.896
<i>The big stuff
looks smaller somehow.</i>

510
00:33:06.071 --> 00:33:10.162
<i>Ya know. that makes just
three of us Minutemen left now.</i>

511
00:33:10.336 --> 00:33:14.775
<i>Me. Hollis and poor Byron
at the asylum in Maine.</i>

512
00:33:14.949 --> 00:33:16.690
<i>Eddie was the youngest.</i>

513
00:33:16.864 --> 00:33:18.561
The Comedian.

514
00:33:18.735 --> 00:33:21.869
Always jokin'
that he'd bury us all.

515
00:33:22.043 --> 00:33:24.872
Always thought
he'd get the last...

516
00:33:25.046 --> 00:33:28.484
laugh.

517
00:33:28.658 --> 00:33:31.270
You and Jon oughta
move out here for the weather.

518
00:33:31.444 --> 00:33:33.141
Lots of sunshine!

519
00:33:33.315 --> 00:33:34.838
What the hell is this?

520
00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:36.971
What are you doing
with this creepy pervert art?

521
00:33:37.145 --> 00:33:39.539
Oh. just some old memorabilia.

522
00:33:39.713 --> 00:33:42.411
Being reminded
that people used to
slobber over me

523
00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:44.935
- is kind of flattering.
- Flattering?

524
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:48.243
Laurie. I'm 65.

525
00:33:48.417 --> 00:33:52.204
Every day the future
looks a little bit darker.

526
00:33:53.161 --> 00:33:54.510
But the past...

527
00:33:54.684 --> 00:33:56.947
even the grimy parts of it.

528
00:33:58.427 --> 00:34:00.386
keep getting brighter
all the time.

529
00:34:07.306 --> 00:34:09.569
Okay. that's it!
Nice picture. folks!

530
00:34:09.743 --> 00:34:12.006
Finally.
I can scratch my armpit.

531
00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.747
Got spots in my eyes.

532
00:34:13.921 --> 00:34:15.227
Here lemme take a look.

533
00:34:15.401 --> 00:34:17.751
maybe I can
fish 'em out for you.

534
00:34:17.925 --> 00:34:21.189
Oh. Eddie.
give me a break.

535
00:34:21.363 --> 00:34:22.582
Okay everybody.
we're good.

536
00:34:22.756 --> 00:34:24.366
So let's meet
in the lobby in five.

537
00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:25.585
We'll go back
to the Owl's Nest
for a beer.

538
00:34:25.759 --> 00:34:28.196
You go on ahead.
I gotta change.

539
00:34:46.258 --> 00:34:47.563
- Hi.
- Eddie.

540
00:34:47.737 --> 00:34:49.087
what are you doing here?

541
00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:50.566
You knew I was changing...

542
00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.787
Sure did. You announced it
loud enough.

543
00:34:53.961 --> 00:34:57.878
C'mon. baby.
I know what you need...

544
00:34:58.052 --> 00:35:00.750
know why you wear
an outfit like that.

545
00:35:00.924 --> 00:35:02.665
Eddie. no--

546
00:35:02.839 --> 00:35:05.799
Spelled Y-E-S.

547
00:35:05.973 --> 00:35:07.061
Spelled N-O!

548
00:35:13.633 --> 00:35:15.939
Eddie...

549
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.301
What... what's happening?

550
00:35:29.475 --> 00:35:30.824
Eddie. what are you doing?

551
00:35:30.998 --> 00:35:33.261
You sick little bastard!

552
00:35:35.437 --> 00:35:38.048
I'm going to break your neck!

553
00:35:52.019 --> 00:35:54.369
This is what you like.
isn't it?

554
00:35:54.543 --> 00:35:56.980
This is what gets you hot.

555
00:35:57.155 --> 00:35:59.418
Get out.

556
00:35:59.592 --> 00:36:01.942
Oh. sure. Sure. I'm going.

557
00:36:03.117 --> 00:36:05.119
But I got your number...

558
00:36:05.293 --> 00:36:07.077
And one of these days.

559
00:36:07.252 --> 00:36:09.558
the joke's gonna be on you.

560
00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.349
Thou hast set
our misdeeds before thee.

561
00:36:17.523 --> 00:36:22.049
and our secret sins
in the light
of thy countenance.

562
00:36:22.223 --> 00:36:25.922
As much as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy

563
00:36:26.096 --> 00:36:30.710
to take unto himself
the soul of our dear brother
here departed.

564
00:36:30.884 --> 00:36:33.234
We therefore commit his body
to the ground.

565
00:36:33.408 --> 00:36:39.501
earth to earth. ashes to ashes.
dust to dust.

566
00:36:39.675 --> 00:36:44.202
Our Father. who art in heaven.
hallowed be thy name.

567
00:36:44.376 --> 00:36:51.252
Thy kingdom come.
thy will be done.
on Earth as it is in heaven.

568
00:36:51.426 --> 00:36:54.212
Give us this day
our daily bread.

569
00:36:54.386 --> 00:36:55.865
and forgive us our trespasses

570
00:36:56.039 --> 00:36:59.739
as we forgive those
that trespass against us.

571
00:36:59.913 --> 00:37:02.481
And lead us not
into temptation.

572
00:37:02.655 --> 00:37:04.526
but deliver us from evil.

573
00:37:05.266 --> 00:37:06.180
Amen.

574
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:48.962
Edgar William Jacobi.
Also known as Moloch.

575
00:37:49.136 --> 00:37:50.572
I don't know what
you're talking about.

576
00:37:50.746 --> 00:37:51.704
you've got the wrong person.

577
00:37:51.878 --> 00:37:53.053
I'm a retired businessman.

578
00:37:53.227 --> 00:37:55.621
Lying. Do it again. broken arm.

579
00:37:55.795 --> 00:37:58.058
Oh. God. I spent
the '70s in jail.

580
00:37:58.232 --> 00:37:59.581
I'm not Moloch anymore.

581
00:37:59.755 --> 00:38:01.627
I just want to be left alone.

582
00:38:03.019 --> 00:38:04.717
You attended
funeral today. Why?

583
00:38:04.891 --> 00:38:07.589
I... just felt I should.

584
00:38:07.763 --> 00:38:09.548
I've been thinking
about the Comedian a lot--

585
00:38:09.722 --> 00:38:11.289
How do you know Edward Blake
was the Comedian?

586
00:38:11.463 --> 00:38:13.595
He broke in to see me
two weeks ago!

587
00:38:13.769 --> 00:38:15.162
His mask was off!

588
00:38:15.336 --> 00:38:17.599
Enemies for 40 years!
Why should he visit you?

589
00:38:17.773 --> 00:38:18.992
I don't know!

590
00:38:19.166 --> 00:38:21.473
I just woke up
and he was there!

591
00:38:21.647 --> 00:38:23.257
I thought he was
going to kill me.

592
00:38:23.431 --> 00:38:26.913
He was drunk.
not making sense--

593
00:38:28.088 --> 00:38:30.482
It's a joke.

594
00:38:30.656 --> 00:38:32.571
It's all a joke.

595
00:38:32.745 --> 00:38:34.964
I thought I knew
how the world was.

596
00:38:35.138 --> 00:38:37.967
but then I found out
about this gag.

597
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:40.100
this joke...

598
00:38:40.274 --> 00:38:42.972
You're part of it. Moloch.
old pal. you know that?

599
00:38:43.146 --> 00:38:46.628
I saw your name on the list.
you and Janey Slater.

600
00:38:46.802 --> 00:38:49.588
If I thought you were
in on this. I'd kill you. understand?

601
00:38:49.762 --> 00:38:52.155
I mean. you fought
that big blue geek.

602
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.070
You know what his head's like.

603
00:38:54.244 --> 00:38:56.246
Who knows which way
he'll jump if anyone
messes with him?

604
00:38:58.379 --> 00:39:01.295
I never shoulda looked
out that airship window.

605
00:39:01.469 --> 00:39:02.862
Never seen that island.

606
00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:05.038
Never got involved.

607
00:39:05.212 --> 00:39:07.780
See. on that island.

608
00:39:07.954 --> 00:39:11.566
they got writers and artists
and scientists.

609
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.787
and what they're doing
is just...

610
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.794
I've done some bad things.

611
00:39:22.795 --> 00:39:24.710
Did bad things to women.

612
00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:27.669
Shot kids in 'Nam...

613
00:39:27.843 --> 00:39:33.240
but I never did anything
like... like...

614
00:39:33.414 --> 00:39:36.896
Oh. mother.

615
00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:38.419
Forgive me.

616
00:39:38.593 --> 00:39:42.118
Forgive me. forgive me.
forgive me...

617
00:39:42.292 --> 00:39:44.991
It's a joke.

618
00:39:45.165 --> 00:39:46.601
But I don't get it!

619
00:39:46.775 --> 00:39:48.690
What's so goddamned funny!

620
00:39:48.864 --> 00:39:50.431
Somebody explain it to me!

621
00:39:50.605 --> 00:39:53.521
Somebody please
explain it to me.

622
00:39:53.695 --> 00:39:55.784
And then he left.

623
00:39:55.958 --> 00:39:57.873
I don't know what
the hell it was about.

624
00:39:58.047 --> 00:39:59.658
Hmm.

625
00:39:59.832 --> 00:40:01.050
Funny story.

626
00:40:01.224 --> 00:40:02.400
Sounds unbelievable.

627
00:40:02.574 --> 00:40:03.792
Probably true.

628
00:40:03.966 --> 00:40:06.665
So that's it?

629
00:40:06.839 --> 00:40:08.362
- I'm clean?
- No.

630
00:40:08.536 --> 00:40:10.103
Searched house
before you got back.

631
00:40:10.277 --> 00:40:12.105
Found phony medication.

Well. when you're desperate.
you'll try anything.

634
00:40:21.506 --> 00:40:25.205
I... I have cancer.

635
00:40:25.379 --> 00:40:28.251
Cancer? What kind?

636
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:31.646
You know the kind of cancer
you eventually get better from?

637
00:40:33.518 --> 00:40:34.736
This ain't it.

638
00:40:38.523 --> 00:40:41.743
Wrote down name of company.
Will report them later.

639
00:40:41.917 --> 00:40:44.485
You're off the hook for now.

640

<i>I found myself upon
a dismal beachhead.</i>

690
00:43:31.391 --> 00:43:37.876
<i>amongst dead men and...
the pieces of dead men.</i>

691
00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:39.834
I'm informed on these things.

692
00:43:40.008 --> 00:43:41.836
I see every paper in the world.

693
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.273
See. everything's connected.

694
00:43:44.447 --> 00:43:46.667
<i>I begged that the gulls
should take my eyes...</i>

695
00:43:46.841 --> 00:43:49.278
A news vendor
understands that reality.

696
00:43:49.452 --> 00:43:51.367
<i>...thus sparing me the horrors.</i>

697
00:43:51.541 --> 00:43:53.631
The weight o' the world's
on him. but he can take it.

698
00:43:53.805 --> 00:43:56.242
<i>But at least I was alive.</i>

699
00:43:56.416 --> 00:43:58.070
He's a survivor.

700
00:43:58.244 --> 00:44:00.463
<i>And I knew that life
had no worse news to offer me.</i>

701
00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:01.508
Good afternoon.

702
00:44:02.552 --> 00:44:04.380
Is it here yet?

703
00:44:04.554 --> 00:44:06.382
Oh! Your copy of today's
<i>New Frontiersman.</i> coming up.

704
00:44:06.556 --> 00:44:09.211
I keep it for ya
every day. don't I? Uh...

705
00:44:10.952 --> 00:44:13.085
Hey. how's the end
of the world coming?

706
00:44:13.259 --> 00:44:15.565
Today for certain.

707
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.872
You won't forget to keep
my paper for me tomorrow?

708
00:44:18.046 --> 00:44:19.569
Sure will!

709
00:44:19.744 --> 00:44:21.397
<i>I had a sudden memory</i>

710
00:44:21.571 --> 00:44:23.443
<i>of clinging fast to someone
through the tempest.</i>

711
00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:26.925
<i>Our fateful ship's figurehead.</i>

712
00:44:27.099 --> 00:44:29.057
<i>now lying at my feet.</i>

713
00:44:29.231 --> 00:44:33.366
<i>blindfolded by seaweed. smiling.</i>

714
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.195
<i>I thought better
of removing the kelp
from her eyes.</i>

715
00:44:36.369 --> 00:44:41.940
<i>not wishing her to suffer
the terrible distractions
of that grim tideline.</i>

716
00:44:42.114 --> 00:44:44.986
<i>She had borne me
through seas of blood.</i>

717
00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.120
<i>had nourished me
in the heart of the storm.</i>

718
00:44:48.294 --> 00:44:52.167
<i>This small comfort
was all I could offer.</i>

719
00:44:52.341 --> 00:44:55.301
<i>for I could not love her
as she had loved me.</i>

720
00:45:02.308 --> 00:45:05.354
Mmm... Jon...

721
00:45:05.528 --> 00:45:08.444
don't you have to do
a TV interview soon?

722
00:45:08.618 --> 00:45:12.100
No. We have plenty of time.

723
00:45:12.274 --> 00:45:13.667
Laurie?

724
00:45:13.841 --> 00:45:16.888
Oh. God! Jon.
just be one person again!

725
00:45:17.062 --> 00:45:20.718
Don't be upset. I'm sorry.
I thought you'd enjoy it.

726
00:45:20.892 --> 00:45:22.328
I was just trying
to please you.

727
00:45:22.502 --> 00:45:23.677
I-I-I know.

728
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:26.636
I know. I'm sorry
I over-reacted.

729
00:45:26.811 --> 00:45:29.465
You just startled me is all.

730
00:45:29.639 --> 00:45:30.771
I'm fine. It doesn't--

731
00:45:34.427 --> 00:45:35.733
Laurie?

732
00:45:35.907 --> 00:45:38.779
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay?

733
00:45:38.953 --> 00:45:40.825
This whole time
you've been working out here

734
00:45:40.999 --> 00:45:42.478
while we were in bed?

735
00:45:42.652 --> 00:45:44.654
My work's
at an important stage.

736
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:47.657
- It didn't seem necessary to--
- To what?

737
00:45:47.832 --> 00:45:50.791
Give me your full attention?

738
00:45:50.965 --> 00:45:52.575
For once?

739
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.795
If there's a problem
with my attitude.

740
00:45:54.969 --> 00:45:56.710
I'm prepared to discuss it.

741
00:46:01.976 --> 00:46:03.151
I hate you.

742
00:46:06.328 --> 00:46:07.373
Laurie?

743
00:47:01.731 --> 00:47:02.732
I left Jon.

744
00:47:02.907 --> 00:47:05.866
Oh. I... I'm sorry. I--

745
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:10.740
And I'm sorry
to dump this on you.

746
00:47:10.915 --> 00:47:14.179
but you don't know
what it's like.
living with him.

747
00:47:17.486 --> 00:47:19.967
For him...

748
00:47:20.141 --> 00:47:23.492
<i>the real world is like
walking through mist.</i>

749
00:47:23.666 --> 00:47:27.757
and all the people
are just shadows.

750
00:47:27.932 --> 00:47:30.543
<i>I mean. the way
he looks at things.</i>

751
00:47:30.717 --> 00:47:33.154
<i>like he can't remember
what they are.</i>

752
00:47:33.328 --> 00:47:36.679
<i>and he doesn't
particularly care.</i>

753
00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:39.900
Sometimes I look at myself
and I don't understand

754
00:47:40.074 --> 00:47:44.731
how things got so tangled up.

755
00:47:53.914 --> 00:47:56.438
- Hey. can we go out?
- Oh!

756
00:47:56.612 --> 00:47:57.962
- Get some air?
- Um...

757
00:47:59.267 --> 00:48:01.356
I'll get my coat.

758
00:48:02.836 --> 00:48:03.793
<i>Let's go.</i>

759
00:48:14.326 --> 00:48:16.197
- Oh! Dr. Manhattan!
- Dr. Osterman...

760
00:48:16.371 --> 00:48:17.938
We need to get you
into make-up.

761
00:48:18.112 --> 00:48:20.506
That blue is-is
far too light for broadcast.

762
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.074
- Is this dark enough?
- That's perfect!

763
00:48:23.248 --> 00:48:26.729
Here's a list of no-go
talking points compiled
by army intelligence.

764
00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:29.471
Afghanistan will come up
but play it cool...

765
00:48:29.645 --> 00:48:33.649
<i>And try not to get into
any tight corners.</i>

766
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.568
Ladies and gentlemen.
we have something really
special for you tonight.

767
00:48:39.742 --> 00:48:41.527
In his first live interview.

768
00:48:41.701 --> 00:48:44.138
let's have a hand
for Doctor Manhattan himself.

769
00:48:44.312 --> 00:48:48.142
Dr. Jon Osterman!

770
00:48:48.316 --> 00:48:51.145
So. uh... what's up. Doc?

771
00:48:51.319 --> 00:48:53.713
Well. you'll forgive
the levity. doctor.

772
00:48:53.887 --> 00:48:56.455
<i>but the news overseas
has everyone a little tense.</i>

773
00:48:56.629 --> 00:49:02.200
<i>So. before
I throw you to our hungry
reporters here tonight.</i>

774
00:49:02.374 --> 00:49:05.420
<i>let me kick things off
with this...</i>

775
00:49:05.594 --> 00:49:08.336
If the Reds act up
in Afghanistan.

776
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:11.687
are you prepared
to enter hostilities?

777
00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:15.865
There is no situation
in Afghanistan currently
requiring my attention.

778
00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:18.346
Ahem. If I can jump in.

779
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.566
Doug Roth. <i>Nova Express.</i>

780
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:24.439
Dr Osterman...
Do you remember Wally Weaver?

781
00:49:24.613 --> 00:49:27.138
<i>The newspapers called him
Dr. Manhattan's buddy.</i>

782
00:49:27.312 --> 00:49:30.315
<i>- He died of cancer in '71...</i>
- <i>I remember.</i>

783
00:49:31.838 --> 00:49:33.535
I attended Wally's funeral

784
00:49:33.709 --> 00:49:37.452
How about Edgar W. Jacobi.
aka Moloch?

785
00:49:37.626 --> 00:49:40.499
<i>You and he battled it out many
times over the years.</i>

786
00:49:40.673 --> 00:49:42.936
<i>Did you know he's
also battling terminal cancer?</i>

787
00:49:44.546 --> 00:49:47.549
No. I did not know that.
I would rather not--

788
00:49:47.723 --> 00:49:49.856
And are you aware
that Janey Slater.

789
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:52.511
with whom you were
romantically linked
for several years.

790
00:49:52.685 --> 00:49:55.296
is suffering from lung cancer?

791
00:50:00.954 --> 00:50:03.870
No. I... I wasn't told. I--

792
00:50:04.044 --> 00:50:06.003
Or that she has
six months to live?

793
00:50:06.177 --> 00:50:07.700
<i>I recently interviewed
Ms. Slater.</i>

794
00:50:07.874 --> 00:50:09.310
<i>Her story's hitting
the streets right now.</i>

795
00:50:11.704 --> 00:50:13.662
- What are you suggesting?
- Jon.

796
00:50:13.836 --> 00:50:16.883
Doug has reports
of over two dozen
of your former associates

797
00:50:17.057 --> 00:50:18.493
who have been
similarly afflicted--

798
00:50:18.667 --> 00:50:20.104
No. I--

799
00:50:20.278 --> 00:50:22.193
Do you have any response
to these allegations?

800
00:50:26.893 --> 00:50:28.590
- Are we gonna get cancer?
- Is this guy radioactive?

801
00:50:29.504 --> 00:50:30.810
Leave me alone.

802
00:50:30.984 --> 00:50:33.117
Do you think
you gave Ms. Slater cancer

803
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:34.422
<i>by sleeping with her?</i>

804
00:50:37.469 --> 00:50:39.427
I said--

805
00:50:39.601 --> 00:50:41.777
How does it feel knowing
you may have doomed
hundreds of people?

806
00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:45.303
Leave me alone!

807
00:51:17.422 --> 00:51:18.597
Um...

808
00:51:19.772 --> 00:51:22.514
- You okay?
- Yeah. Fine.

809
00:51:22.688 --> 00:51:24.777
Um... I...

810
00:51:24.951 --> 00:51:27.475
We just need to get
our breath back.

811
00:51:27.649 --> 00:51:30.217
- We should--
- I'm just gonna go
grab a hotel.

812
00:51:30.391 --> 00:51:31.871
Think my relationship over.

813
00:51:32.045 --> 00:51:33.307
Oh. Of course.

814
00:51:33.481 --> 00:51:36.049
Thanks for listening. Dan.
Take care.

815
00:51:36.223 --> 00:51:37.006
Sure...

816
00:51:37.181 --> 00:51:38.704
W-w...

817
00:51:40.619 --> 00:51:42.142
You too. Laurie...

818
00:51:43.535 --> 00:51:44.362
<i>Bye.</i>

819
00:51:52.892 --> 00:51:56.591
<i>The freighter's murderous
onslaught had surprised us.</i>

820
00:51:59.638 --> 00:52:03.729
<i>We'd been blasted to fragments
before we could warn Davidstown
of the hell-ship's approach.</i>

821
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:07.515
<i>I thought of my family there.</i>

822
00:52:07.689 --> 00:52:11.389
<i>vulnerable. unsuspecting.</i>

823
00:52:11.563 --> 00:52:14.783
<i>unaware of the damnation
that bore down upon them.</i>

824
00:52:16.872 --> 00:52:22.051
<i>Crazed with helplessness.
I cursed God and wept.</i>

825
00:52:22.226 --> 00:52:24.532
<i>wondering if he wept also.</i>

826
00:52:24.706 --> 00:52:28.710
<i>But then. what use
are his tears if he
also denied me help?</i>

827
00:52:31.365 --> 00:52:36.675
<i>That night I slept badly
beneath cold. distant stars</i>

828
00:52:36.849 --> 00:52:39.634
<i>pondering the cold. distant god</i>

829
00:52:39.808 --> 00:52:43.029
<i>in whose hands the fate
of Davidstown rested.</i>

830
00:52:45.814 --> 00:52:47.207
<i>Was he really there?</i>

831
00:52:48.513 --> 00:52:50.297
<i>Had he been there once...</i>

832
00:52:51.603 --> 00:52:53.300
<i>But now departed?</i>

833
00:52:53.474 --> 00:52:57.435
Hey. this base is off limits.
You don't belong... here.

834
00:52:59.045 --> 00:53:00.742
I believe you are correct.

835
00:53:02.483 --> 00:53:05.225
Please tell your superiors
and Laurie Juspeczyk

836
00:53:05.399 --> 00:53:06.618
that I am leaving.

837
00:53:07.619 --> 00:53:08.881
Leaving for Mars.

838
00:53:21.154 --> 00:53:24.244
Gone? What do you mean
he's gone?

839
00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:28.770
Ma'am. your meal ticket
flew the coop after
last night's broadcast.

840
00:53:28.944 --> 00:53:31.904
Dr. Manhattan. the linchpin
of America's security.

841
00:53:32.078 --> 00:53:33.558
has left Earth.

842
00:53:33.732 --> 00:53:35.342
<i>Mr. President...</i>

843
00:53:35.516 --> 00:53:37.344
The Russians are invading
Afghanistan and Pakistan.

844
00:53:37.518 --> 00:53:40.173
If this keeps up.
they'll try taking
Western Europe next.

845
00:53:40.347 --> 00:53:44.090
If Dr. Manhattan
wanted to live on a red planet.

846
00:53:44.264 --> 00:53:46.266
he should've stayed home.

847
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.790
Keep running the numbers
for our losses in a nuclear exchange.

848
00:53:48.964 --> 00:53:52.011
And be ready
for a first strike
in seven days.

849
00:53:52.185 --> 00:53:53.795
Good morning. Daniel.

850
00:53:53.969 --> 00:53:55.449
Brought you your paper.

851
00:53:55.623 --> 00:53:59.105
The Comedian murdered.
Dr. Manhattan exiled...

852
00:53:59.279 --> 00:54:02.413
Two of us gone.
All within a week.

853
00:54:02.587 --> 00:54:07.418
Who next? Veidt?
Juspeczyk? Me? You?

854
00:54:07.592 --> 00:54:10.551
These days. nobody's safe.

855
00:54:31.137 --> 00:54:33.313
<i>The photograph
is in my hand.</i>

856
00:54:35.359 --> 00:54:37.926
<i>It is the photograph of a man
and a woman.</i>

857
00:54:39.667 --> 00:54:42.757
<i>They are at
an amusement park in 1959.</i>

858
00:54:44.759 --> 00:54:46.805
<i>In exactly 38 seconds.</i>

859
00:54:46.979 --> 00:54:50.461

- No.

<i>I tell him he should know.</i>

1030
01:04:15.503 --> 01:04:16.287
<i>He nods. laughing.</i>

1031
01:04:18.332 --> 01:04:20.813
I don't think
there is a god. Janey.

1032
01:04:20.987 --> 01:04:24.164
If there is. I'm not him.

1033
01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:26.427
<i>November. 1963.</i>

1034
01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:30.431
<i>In Dallas. his head
snaps forward and then
back. Two shots.</i>

1035
01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:33.782
I can't believe this.
So you knew he'd get shot?

1036
01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:35.567
Then why didn't you
do something?

1037
01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:37.786
I cannot prevent the future.

1038
01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:40.833
To me. it is already happening.

1039
01:04:41.007 --> 01:04:43.140
I'm still the same person.

1040
01:04:43.314 --> 01:04:44.750
Nothing's changed.

1041
01:04:46.578 --> 01:04:48.319
<i>It is 1966.</i>

1042
01:04:48.493 --> 01:04:50.495
<i>A young woman sits to my right.</i>

1043
01:04:50.669 --> 01:04:53.672
<i>She looks at me and smiles.</i>

1044
01:04:53.846 --> 01:04:57.328
Stop staring at that girl!
Pay attention!

1045
01:04:57.502 --> 01:05:01.114
I'll always want you.

1046
01:05:01.288 --> 01:05:04.770
<i>As I lie. I hear
her sobbing in 1966.</i>

1047
01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:10.950
<i>It is May. 1966.</i>

1048
01:05:11.124 --> 01:05:13.126
My name's Laurie.

1049
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.825
Do you have another name.
apart from Dr. Manhattan.

1050
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.871
You pig.

1051
01:05:20.612 --> 01:05:21.830
My name's Jon.

1052
01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:24.572
I knew
you were seeing her!

1053
01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:30.056
It's nice of you to come out
on patrol with me.

1054
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:33.712
Your um. girlfriend
won't mind. will she?

1055
01:05:33.886 --> 01:05:35.844
<i>As I lie...</i>

1056
01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:38.978
- I hate you.
<i>- ...I see her walking
out on me in 1985.</i>

1057
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.416
<i>She is beautiful.</i>

1058
01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:46.507
<i>After each kiss.
she plants a smaller.
gentler one on my face.</i>

1059
01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:48.683
<i>like a signature.</i>

1060
01:05:48.857 --> 01:05:52.122
<i>I pull her closer.
never wanting to lose her.</i>

1061
01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:53.514
<i>Knowing that I shall.</i>

1062
01:06:01.783 --> 01:06:03.829
<i>I am tired of their world...</i>

1063
01:06:07.572 --> 01:06:09.617
<i>of these people.</i>

1064
01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:12.055
Alone!

1065
01:06:12.229 --> 01:06:15.493
<i>I am tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.</i>

1066
01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:20.411
<i>In Arizona.
I am taking the photo...</i>

1067
01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:22.761
<i>and I am gone.</i>

1068
01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:27.548
<i>Gone to Mars.</i>

1069
01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:35.513
<i>And I have decided
to create something.</i>

1070
01:06:42.737 --> 01:06:45.479
<i>A world grows up around me.</i>

1071
01:06:47.568 --> 01:06:49.483
<i>Am I shaping it.</i>

1072
01:06:49.657 --> 01:06:52.530
<i>or do its predetermined
contours guide my hand?</i>

1073
01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:56.882
<i>The world changed
because of me.</i>

1074
01:06:57.056 --> 01:07:00.973
<i>But what if I hadn't left
the watch in the test chamber?</i>

1075
01:07:01.147 --> 01:07:03.628
<i>What if I had not gone back?</i>

1076
01:07:03.802 --> 01:07:06.544
<i>Or waited. just a moment?</i>

1077
01:07:07.806 --> 01:07:09.677
<i>Am I to blame. then?</i>

1078
01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:10.896
<i>Or Janey?</i>

1079
01:07:12.332 --> 01:07:13.290
<i>Or my father?</i>

1080
01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.293
<i>Which of us is responsible?</i>

1081
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.386
<i>Who makes the world?</i>

1082
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.649
<i>Perhaps the world is not made.</i>

1083
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.478
<i>Perhaps nothing is made.</i>

1084
01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:31.308
<i>Perhaps it simply is.</i>

1085
01:07:31.482 --> 01:07:35.529
<i>has been.
and will always be there.</i>

1086
01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:38.967
<i>A clock without a craftsman.</i>

1087
01:07:40.578 --> 01:07:42.362
<i>I am standing on a balcony.</i>

1088
01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:44.538
<i>as I once stood
on a fire escape.</i>

1089
01:07:44.712 --> 01:07:48.281
<i>trying to catch the falling
cogs and wheels.</i>

1090
01:07:48.455 --> 01:07:50.240
<i>But it is too late.</i>

1091
01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:51.806
<i>Always has been.</i>

1092
01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:55.027
<i>Always will be.</i>

1093
01:07:56.985 --> 01:07:58.944
<i>Above the
Nodous Gordii mountains.</i>

1094
01:07:59.118 --> 01:08:02.730
<i>like jewels
in a maker-less mechanism.</i>

1095
01:08:02.904 --> 01:08:05.559
<i>the first meteorites
begin to fall.</i>

1096
01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:22.881
Oh. God.
not again.

1097
01:08:25.884 --> 01:08:27.103
What do you want from me?

1098
01:08:27.277 --> 01:08:28.974
Nothing.
Old and alone.

1099
01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:30.541
Thought you might
appreciate company.

1100
01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:32.151
Can I come out. then?

1101
01:08:32.804 --> 01:08:33.848
No.

1102
01:08:34.022 --> 01:08:35.850
Deep breath.

1103
01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:38.679
You said Comedian visited here.
Mentioned a list.

1104
01:08:38.853 --> 01:08:40.464
You and Janey Slater
were on it.

1105
01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:42.640
Talked about someone
messing with Dr. Manhattan.

1106
01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:45.164
Days later. Manhattan
publicly disgraced.

1107
01:08:45.338 --> 01:08:46.687
Forced into exile.

1108
01:08:46.861 --> 01:08:49.125
Allegations he'd
given people cancer.

1109
01:08:49.299 --> 01:08:51.214
Janey Slater. You.

1110
01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:54.913
Tough break.

1111
01:08:55.087 --> 01:08:57.133
I think Blake's list
was cancer list.

1112
01:08:57.307 --> 01:08:59.135
Somebody wrote it.
Somebody put your name on it.

1113
01:08:59.309 --> 01:09:01.049
Somebody gave it to the media.

1114
01:09:01.224 --> 01:09:03.487
Comedian and Dr. Manhattan were
always your biggest enemies.

1115
01:09:03.661 --> 01:09:04.792
Now they're both gone.

1116
01:09:04.966 --> 01:09:06.968
Very convenient.
Who is it. Moloch?

1117
01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.927
- Who's behind this?
- I don't know!

1118
01:09:09.101 --> 01:09:11.234
- Not convincing.
- I don't know!

1119
01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:13.018
I don't know!

1120
01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:16.064
I swear to God.
I don't know who it was!

1121
01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:18.241
Hmm. Better.

1122
01:09:20.852 --> 01:09:22.636
If anything should
refresh memory.

1123
01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:24.551
contact me by leaving note.

1124
01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:27.772
trash can opposite Gunga Diner.
at 40th and 7th.

1125
01:09:32.385 --> 01:09:37.085
<i>Rorschach's journal.
October 21st. 1985. 2:35 AM.</i>

1126
01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.523
<i>Jacobi visit useless.
Knows nothing.</i>

1127
01:09:39.697 --> 01:09:42.439
<i>Has simply been used.
But by who?</i>

1128
01:09:42.613 --> 01:09:43.657
<i>Russians?</i>

1129
01:09:43.831 --> 01:09:45.355
<i>Comedian mentioned an island.</i>

1130
01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:47.792
<i>artists and writers
living on it.</i>

1131
01:09:47.966 --> 01:09:49.446
<i>Doesn't fit.</i>

1132
01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.057
<i>Waiting for a flash
of enlightenment</i>

1133
01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:54.190
<i>in all this blood and thunder.</i>

1134
01:10:01.719 --> 01:10:03.590
<i>Everything I loved.</i>

1135
01:10:03.764 --> 01:10:06.289
<i>everything I lived for.</i>

1136
01:10:06.463 --> 01:10:11.642
<i>depended on my reaching
Davidstown in advance
of that terrible freighter.</i>

1137
01:10:11.816 --> 01:10:14.514
<i>It was then I conceived
of building a raft.</i>

1138
01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:19.171
<i>But the island's trees
did not look buoyant enough
to reach Davidstown.</i>

1139
01:10:19.345 --> 01:10:21.478
<i>not unaided.</i>

1140
01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:26.613
<i>Suddenly. I found myself considering
a repulsive notion...</i>

1141
01:10:26.787 --> 01:10:31.705
<i>Birthed from the gas-bloated
stomachs of the buried men.</i>

1142
01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:35.622
<i>I shuddered
at my loathsome scheme.</i>

1143
01:10:35.796 --> 01:10:38.930
<i>But I had no choice.</i>

1144
01:10:39.104 --> 01:10:41.237
<i>I pulled men up
from underground.</i>

1145
01:10:41.411 --> 01:10:43.630
<i>sand trickling
from their sockets.</i>

1146
01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:47.155
<i>I tore their clothes to ribbons
to bind them together.</i>

1147
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:50.594
<i>I fixed their bodies
to the bottom of the raft.</i>

1148
01:10:50.768 --> 01:10:52.378
<i>As the ebb tide rose.</i>

1149
01:10:52.552 --> 01:10:56.556
<i>I embarked. heading east.</i>

1150
01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:59.864
<i>East. across the night seas.</i>

1151
01:11:00.038 --> 01:11:03.650
<i>Borne on the naked backs
of murdered men.</i>

1152
01:11:05.086 --> 01:11:06.697
<i>Lent speed by my hunger.</i>

1153
01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:08.655
<i>I ripped a seagull
from the air.</i>

1154
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:13.791
<i>I had not eaten
since the shipwreck.</i>

1155
01:11:13.965 --> 01:11:19.187
<i>Chewing on raw meat.
I drifted on toward Davidstown.</i>

1156
01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:21.059
<i>My home was there.</i>

1157
01:11:21.233 --> 01:11:23.931
<i>And nothing would
take it from me.</i>

1158
01:11:24.105 --> 01:11:26.238
So...
the government said

1159
01:11:26.412 --> 01:11:28.327
I can't live on the base
now that Jon's gone.

1160
01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:31.069
And they canceled
my credit cards.

1161
01:11:31.243 --> 01:11:33.419
Now all I have left
is my savings.

1162
01:11:33.593 --> 01:11:35.900
What-- Where...
where will you stay?

1163
01:11:36.074 --> 01:11:37.205
Did you call your mother?

1164
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.338
I'd rather sleep
on a street grate.

1165
01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:41.775
It just burns my ass
to be so damn...

1166
01:11:43.211 --> 01:11:44.300
disposable.

1167
01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:47.868
- Well. I um--
- Anyway.

1168
01:11:48.042 --> 01:11:51.394
I appreciate you
buying me lunch. Dan.

1169
01:11:51.568 --> 01:11:53.526
Don't worry about me.

1170
01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.267
I'll find someplace cheap
to stay.

1171
01:11:59.053 --> 01:12:00.620
- Laurie!
- Yeah?

1172
01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:03.231
You could. uh. always
stay at my place.

1173
01:12:03.406 --> 01:12:04.842
There's plenty of room.

1174
01:12:05.016 --> 01:12:06.626
Oh. I-I don't want to impose.

1175
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.585
Hey... you're not.

1176
01:12:09.237 --> 01:12:10.151
Truly.

1177
01:12:11.675 --> 01:12:13.590
I mean. we're both friends.

1178
01:12:13.764 --> 01:12:15.331
We're both in
the same line of work.

1179
01:12:15.505 --> 01:12:17.071
And we're both. uh...

1180
01:12:17.245 --> 01:12:19.073
We're both leftovers.

1181
01:12:21.467 --> 01:12:23.817
Yeah.

1182
01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:26.690
<i>I'd swallowed too much
bird flesh.</i>

1183
01:12:26.864 --> 01:12:29.649
<i>too much horror.</i>

1184
01:12:29.823 --> 01:12:33.087
<i>I grew faint
and dozed fitfully.</i>

1185
01:12:33.261 --> 01:12:38.310
<i>The Black Freighter's
hideous banner flapped
dismally in my dreams.</i>

1186
01:12:38.484 --> 01:12:42.619
<i>Its death's-head banner
flies above us all.</i>

1187
01:12:42.793 --> 01:12:49.016
<i>And the heads nailed
to the ship's black prow
are our heads.</i>

1188
01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:54.587
<i>Truly. whoever we are.
wherever we reside.</i>

1189
01:12:54.761 --> 01:12:58.025
<i>we exist on the whim
of murderers.</i>

1190
01:12:59.766 --> 01:13:01.725
Your four o'clock
is here. Mr. Veidt.

1191
01:13:01.899 --> 01:13:04.902
<i>Beneath my raft.
something moved.</i>

1192
01:13:05.076 --> 01:13:07.034
It's the meeting
with the toy company. isn't it?

1193
01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:10.473
Yes. They want some
new characters in
their Ozymandias line.

1194
01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:13.214
They said maybe
some of your major villains.

1195
01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.653
The major villains
are all dead.

1196
01:13:16.827 --> 01:13:20.918
<i>Irrationally. my first thought
was of the corpses.</i>

1197
01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:22.833
<i>bursting their bonds.</i>

1198
01:13:23.007 --> 01:13:26.140
<i>attempting to clamber up
into the air and dryness.</i>

1199
01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:32.756
Did you see the news?

1200
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:34.932
Some guy went crazy
and killed his kid

1201
01:13:35.106 --> 01:13:38.022
because he was afraid
there's gonna be a nuclear war.

1202
01:13:38.196 --> 01:13:40.720
I'm sorry.
but that's just dumb.

1203
01:13:40.894 --> 01:13:43.375
Nobody's so crazy
that they'll start a war.

1204
01:13:43.549 --> 01:13:47.379
I don't understand why
everyone's so down and scared.

1205
01:13:47.553 --> 01:13:50.426
Well. perhaps they lack
your youth and enthusiasm.

1206
01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.950
Well. I have to be upbeat
to work in this place.

1207
01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:55.343
All this Egyptian decor
is very morbid.

1208
01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:57.998
<i>In the darkening water
I heard a splash.</i>

1209
01:13:58.172 --> 01:13:59.783
Very obsessed
with death.

1210
01:13:59.957 --> 01:14:02.655
<i>Shadowy forms approached.</i>

1211
01:14:02.829 --> 01:14:05.832
<i>Were they boats
come to rescue me?</i>

1212
01:14:06.006 --> 01:14:09.314
Actually death wasn't morbid
to the ancient Egyptians.

1213
01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:11.577
They saw death
as an inevitable step

1214
01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:14.711
in beginning a voyage
of spiritual discovery.

1215
01:14:14.885 --> 01:14:16.190
I find that very comforting.

1216
01:14:16.364 --> 01:14:19.237
<i>No. not boats.</i>

1217
01:14:19.411 --> 01:14:20.760
<i>Fins.</i>

1218
01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:22.936
Well. I think it's--
Oh. God. he's got a gun!

1219
01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:29.160
<i>Teeth shredded my raft.</i>

1220
01:14:29.334 --> 01:14:32.206
<i>Tiny. prehistoric eyes
glistened with rage.</i>

1221
01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:36.950
<i>It became tangled in my ropes.</i>

1222
01:14:37.124 --> 01:14:40.345
<i>Terrified. I took up
a splinter of mast.</i>

1223
01:14:40.519 --> 01:14:43.391
<i>The shark's stained marble eye
looked up at me...</i>

1224
01:14:43.566 --> 01:14:45.263
<i>And in that instant...</i>

1225
01:14:45.437 --> 01:14:47.178
<i>We knew each other!</i>

1226
01:14:47.352 --> 01:14:48.875
What have you got
in your mouth? No!

1227
01:14:49.049 --> 01:14:52.183
Don't bite down.
Don't bite down. you scum!

1228
01:14:52.357 --> 01:14:54.185
<i>The leviathan
attempted to swim away...</i>

1229
01:14:54.359 --> 01:14:56.753
<i>Dragging my raft
in its bloody wake.</i>

1230
01:14:56.927 --> 01:14:58.406
I want to know
who's behind this!

1231
01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:00.583
<i>I hung on desperately.</i>

1232
01:15:00.757 --> 01:15:03.673
<i>cursing in the bitter
stinging spray.</i>

1233
01:15:06.153 --> 01:15:08.808
Damn... cyanide capsule.

1234
01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:20.516
<i>Eventually the shark died.</i>

1235
01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:24.520
<i>And shortly thereafter.
stopped swimming.</i>

1236
01:15:30.003 --> 01:15:31.352
Good evening. Jacobi.

1237
01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.094
Was wondering why
you wanted to see me.

1238
01:15:34.268 --> 01:15:36.532
Then someone tried to shoot
the world's smartest man.

1239
01:15:36.706 --> 01:15:39.535
Comedian. Dr. Manhattan. Ozymandias...

1240
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:41.188
someone's killing
masks. Jacobi.

1241
01:15:41.362 --> 01:15:42.929
Someone wants us dead.

1242
01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:44.365
Maybe you can enlighten me.

1243
01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:46.716
Hmm...

1244
01:15:51.764 --> 01:15:52.809
<i>Rorschach!</i>

1245
01:15:52.983 --> 01:15:54.071
- No.
<i>- This is the police!</i>

1246
01:15:54.245 --> 01:15:56.073
No. no. no. no!

1247
01:15:56.247 --> 01:15:58.597
<i>We know you're in there.
it's all over!</i>

1248
01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:00.860
<i>If there's anyone
in there with you.</i>

1249
01:16:01.034 --> 01:16:02.688
<i>- send them out unharmed!</i>
- Framed. Set-up.

1250
01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:04.864
Walked right into it.
Stupid. stupid. stupid.

1251
01:16:05.038 --> 01:16:06.605
<i>Then come out
and surrender with your
hands clearly visible.</i>

1252
01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:09.347
Never. Never surrender.
Need weapons.

1253
01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:11.131
<i>You have 30 seconds!</i>

1254
01:16:12.916 --> 01:16:15.788
<i>There's no escape Rorschach.</i>

1255
01:16:15.962 --> 01:16:17.747
<i>- It's the end of the line.</i>
- Yes.

1256
01:16:19.052 --> 01:16:20.358
<i>Time's up!</i>

1257
01:16:20.532 --> 01:16:22.012
Ready when you are.

1258
01:17:07.666 --> 01:17:09.537
Get up. get up!

1259
01:17:09.712 --> 01:17:11.104
- No pain. no--
- Get him!
Don't let him get away!

1260
01:17:11.278 --> 01:17:12.236
- It was a setup.
- Cuff him!

1261
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:13.846
Somebody framed me. somebody--

1262
01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.370
No! No! No! My face!

1263
01:17:16.544 --> 01:17:17.807
Give me back my face!

1264
01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:19.373
Give me back my face!

1265
01:17:19.547 --> 01:17:21.941
Give me back my face!

1266
01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:32.865
<i>After eating their fill.
the sharks departed.</i>

1267
01:17:37.565 --> 01:17:40.220
<i>For the moment. I was safe.</i>

1268
01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:46.357
<i>That night. eating shark.</i>

1269
01:17:46.531 --> 01:17:50.970
<i>I would have chuckled
at the inversions
of natural roles</i>

1270
01:17:51.144 --> 01:17:55.540
<i>had not my parched laughter
seemed so hateful.</i>

1271
01:17:58.412 --> 01:18:03.026
<i>My raft grew
increasingly grotesque.</i>

1272
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:06.812
<i>reflecting my own
gradual transformation.</i>

1273
01:18:08.379 --> 01:18:11.556
<i>With such thoughts
to comfort me.</i>

1274
01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:15.952
<i>I drifted on.
mast-less into the dawn.</i>

1275
01:18:32.316 --> 01:18:36.668
<i>Hey kids.
tune in for the animated
adventures of Ozymandias.</i>

1276
01:18:36.842 --> 01:18:40.063
<i>This Saturday morning
sponsored by Meltdown!</i>

1277
01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.632
<i>In the May
of this year. 1962.</i>

1278
01:18:44.807 --> 01:18:47.244
<i>that's exactly what
I opted to do.</i>

1279
01:18:47.418 --> 01:18:48.593
<i>I retired.</i>

1280
01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:50.160
<i>To mend cars.</i>

1281
01:18:50.334 --> 01:18:52.640
<i>Probably for the rest
of my life.</i>

1282
01:18:52.815 --> 01:18:54.730
<i>As I see it.
part of the art of being a hero</i>

1283
01:18:54.904 --> 01:18:57.515
<i>is knowing when you don't
need to be one anymore.</i>

1284
01:18:57.689 --> 01:18:59.778
<i>realizing that the game
has changed.</i>

1285
01:18:59.952 --> 01:19:01.780
<i>and that the stakes
are different.</i>

1286
01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:03.782
<i>and that there isn't
necessarily a place for you</i>

1287
01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:07.177
<i>in this strange new pantheon
of extraordinary people.</i>

1288
01:19:07.351 --> 01:19:08.961
<i>The world has moved on.</i>

1289
01:19:09.135 --> 01:19:11.137
<i>and I'm content to watch it
from my armchair</i>

1290
01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:12.965
<i>with a beer by my side</i>

1291
01:19:13.139 --> 01:19:15.925
<i>and the smell of fresh oil
still on my fingers.</i>

1292
01:19:16.099 --> 01:19:17.796
<i>Part of my contentment
comes from knowing</i>

1293
01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:20.538
<i>that there have maybe been
some overall consequence</i>

1294
01:19:20.712 --> 01:19:23.367
<i>of my 23 years behind the mask.</i>

1295
01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:25.412
<i>This knowledge came to me
in the shape of a letter</i>

1296
01:19:25.586 --> 01:19:29.199
<i>from a young man whose name
I'm not at liberty to reveal.</i>

1297
01:19:29.373 --> 01:19:32.768
<i>He told me of his great
admiration for my efforts
as Nite Owl</i>

1298
01:19:32.942 --> 01:19:34.813
<i>and proposed that.</i>

1299
01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:37.076
<i>since I'd retired and would
no longer be using the name.</i>

1300
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.730
<i>perhaps he could borrow it.</i>

1301
01:19:38.904 --> 01:19:40.906
<i>since he intended
to follow my example</i>

1302
01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.213
<i>and become a crime-fighter.</i>

1303
01:19:43.387 --> 01:19:45.389
<i>I've visited his home
since then</i>

1304
01:19:45.563 --> 01:19:47.608
<i>and seen some
of the fabulous technology</i>

1305
01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:50.481
<i>he intends to bring to bear
on the war against crime.</i>

1306
01:19:50.655 --> 01:19:52.352
<i>I was certainly
far too impressed</i>

1307
01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:54.877
<i>to refuse him the use
of what I'd always thought</i>

1308
01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:57.053
<i>was a dumb name to begin with.</i>

1309
01:19:57.227 --> 01:19:59.446
<i>So by the time this sees print.</i>

1310
01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.231
<i>there may well be
a new Nite Owl</i>

1311
01:20:01.405 --> 01:20:03.842
<i>patrolling the streets
of New York.</i>

1312
01:20:04.016 --> 01:20:05.583
<i>Also. Sally Jupiter tells me</i>

1313
01:20:05.757 --> 01:20:07.454
<i>that as soon as
little Laurie's old enough</i>

1314
01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:10.806
<i>she wants to be a superheroine
just like her mom.</i>

1315
01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.895
<i>So who knows? It seems as if.</i>

1316
01:20:13.069 --> 01:20:14.722
<i>from being a novelty
nine-day wonder.</i>

1317
01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:18.030
<i>the superhero has become
a part of American life.</i>

1318
01:20:18.204 --> 01:20:19.989
<i>It's here to stay.</i>

1319
01:20:20.163 --> 01:20:21.860
<i>For better. or for worse.</i>

1320
01:20:24.341 --> 01:20:28.301
<i>Oh. how the ghost of you
clings... Nostalgia...</i>

1321
01:20:30.086 --> 01:20:32.740
<i>We argued.</i>

1322
01:20:32.915 --> 01:20:34.917
<i>And I said. Jon.</i>

1323
01:20:35.091 --> 01:20:37.310
<i>you know how every
damn thing in this world</i>

1324
01:20:37.484 --> 01:20:39.443
<i>fits together except people.</i>

1325
01:20:39.617 --> 01:20:41.532
<i>It's okay. Ms. Slater.</i>

1326
01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:44.100
<i>We can stop here
if you need to.</i>

1327
01:20:44.274 --> 01:20:47.103
<i>No. No. I want
the world to know
all the details.</i>

1328
01:20:47.277 --> 01:20:49.279
<i>I'm glad you contacted me.</i>

1329
01:20:49.453 --> 01:20:52.412
<i>It's a relief to finally
tell the truth about him.</i>

1330
01:20:52.586 --> 01:20:56.503
<i>Well. after helping
Nova Express with
our investigations.</i>

1331
01:20:56.677 --> 01:20:58.854
<i>and sharing your story
with the world.</i>

1332
01:20:59.028 --> 01:21:00.290
<i>how do you feel?</i>

1333
01:21:00.464 --> 01:21:02.727
<i>Heh. bitter as hell.</i>

1334
01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:05.251
<i>Oh. and I don't need
anyone's sympathy.</i>

1335
01:21:05.425 --> 01:21:07.950
<i>That won't cure my cancer.</i>

1336
01:21:08.124 --> 01:21:10.126
<i>After learning
of your condition.</i>

1337
01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:13.520
<i>and the others. Dr. Osterman
teleported to Mars.</i>

1338
01:21:13.694 --> 01:21:16.393
<i>sending shockwaves
across the globe.</i>

1339
01:21:16.567 --> 01:21:18.482
<i>Any comment about that?</i>

1340
01:21:18.656 --> 01:21:20.832
<i>It figures.</i>

1341
01:21:21.006 --> 01:21:23.139
<i>He dumped me
for some 16-year-old</i>

1342
01:21:23.313 --> 01:21:24.923
<i>who ran around
in her underwear.</i>

1343
01:21:25.097 --> 01:21:27.491
<i>Now everyone's shocked
that he dumped Earth for Mars?</i>

1344
01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:31.060
<i>Ah. they're all just worried</i>

1345
01:21:31.234 --> 01:21:33.453
<i>because he's not here
to stop us from nuking
each other.</i>

1346
01:21:33.627 --> 01:21:37.109
<i>Worried they're all
going to die in a
radioactive wasteland.</i>

1347
01:21:40.678 --> 01:21:44.682
<i>Well. Mr. Roth.
here's your comment...</i>

1348
01:21:44.856 --> 01:21:46.684
<i>welcome to my world.</i>

1349
01:21:54.213 --> 01:21:56.824
<i>So. seen the news lately?</i>

1350
01:21:56.999 --> 01:21:59.784
<i>Can't miss
the headlines about this war
they say is coming.</i>

1351
01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:02.047
There was a smaller story yesterday...

1352
01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:03.919
about a tenement fire?

1353
01:22:06.834 --> 01:22:08.575
<i>If I can figure out
who made the rescue.</i>

1354
01:22:10.403 --> 01:22:11.535
so can the police.

1355
01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:17.062
You're not taking Rorschach's
maskkiller nonsense seriously?

1356
01:22:17.236 --> 01:22:19.325
<i>We worked together.</i>

1357
01:22:19.499 --> 01:22:21.371
<i>Rorschach was always
a brilliant investigator
and tactician.</i>

1358
01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:24.765
so I wonder if he found
any evidence that links
all these events.

1359
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:29.683
<i>The four of us. taken down.</i>

1360
01:22:29.857 --> 01:22:32.251
<i>War looming on the horizon.</i>

1361
01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:34.601
<i>I'm terrified it's all connected</i>

1362
01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:36.168
<i>and the worst is yet to come.</i>

1363
01:22:36.342 --> 01:22:39.824
<i>and I can't do anything
to stop it.</i>

1364
01:22:39.998 --> 01:22:41.521
No!

1365
01:22:41.695 --> 01:22:44.394
Rorschach again...
They finally caught him.

1366
01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:46.178
<i>There's a riot at the prison.</i>

1367
01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:50.661
We got a jail full of guys
out here who hates your guts!

1368
01:22:50.835 --> 01:22:51.705
What do you got?

1369
01:22:52.532 --> 01:22:53.664
Your arms.

1370
01:22:55.622 --> 01:22:58.190
Come and get me.

1371
01:22:58.364 --> 01:22:59.800
<i>If we don't crack
this case.</i>

1372
01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:01.889
<i>there may be no going back
for any of us.</i>

1373
01:23:04.066 --> 01:23:05.806
<i>Everybody's scared.</i>

1374
01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.460
<i>You can feel it.</i>

1375
01:23:07.634 --> 01:23:09.245
<i>We'll get murdered
in the chaos.</i>

1376
01:23:09.419 --> 01:23:12.161
Just waitin' for the nukes
to start droppin'.

1377
01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:15.164
You are going to try
to convince me
to save this world.

1378
01:23:15.338 --> 01:23:18.515
<i>Humanity might be
on the brink of extinction.</i>

1379
01:23:18.689 --> 01:23:20.517
Doesn't that bother you?

1380
01:23:20.691 --> 01:23:24.390
This face is all I need.

1381
01:23:24.564 --> 01:23:26.349
<i>Never compromise.</i>

1382
01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:28.960
Do it!!

1383
01:23:31.484 --> 01:23:33.617
<i>This all says war.</i>

1384
01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:35.445
<i>I will invest accordingly.</i>
