I worked

golf pro shop.

90
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.278

so of course I am back

You may notice
we have a new student
joining us today.

95
00:05:19.362 --> 00:05:20.867
She just moved here
from Kentucky.

96

Kenya.

97
00:05:22.002 --> 00:05:24.442
Kenya. Her name is Caddy.

98
00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:26.334
It's Cady. Cady Heron.

99
00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:28.908
My apologies.
I will commit that to memory.

100
00:05:28.943 --> 00:05:32.813
Cady. like the Canadian
songstress k.d. lang.

101
00:05:32.848 --> 00:05:36.146
and Heron.
like the illegal street drug.

102
00:05:37.116 --> 00:05:39.083
Thank you. Caddy.
It's Cady.

103
00:05:39.118 --> 00:05:41.822
Cady. hi. I'm Ms. Norbury.
I'll be your homeroom teacher.

106
00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:47.223
You must have had excellent
teachers at your old school.

107
00:05:47.258 --> 00:05:49.027
Oh. I was homeschooled.
Homeschooled?

108
00:05:49.062 --> 00:05:51.799
Oh. that's a fun way
to take jobs from my union.

109
00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:53.328
No. I'm joking. It's fine.
Ah.

110
00:05:53.363 --> 00:05:55.297
Um. do you think you can
follow this schedule?

111
00:05:55.332 --> 00:05:57.035
Yeah. I think so.
Okay. you're gonna be moving

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.707

113
00:06:00.403 --> 00:06:01.237

"Crap."
Correct answer was "crap."

123

Find a seat.

124
00:06:30.708 --> 00:06:32.400
I don't want you
to think of me

125
00:06:32.435 --> 00:06:34.006
as just any other teacher.

126
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.546
I prefer to think of myself

127
00:06:35.581 --> 00:06:37.548

131
00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:48.383
You have to pick
a French name.

132
00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:49.758
All the French people I know

133
00:06:49.793 --> 00:06:52.024
just call me Cady.

134
00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:53.696
Just say Marie.

135
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.501

136
00:06:56.536 --> 00:06:58.195

145
00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:18.215
Now. this fall
we'll be getting

146
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.559
into the state-mandated unit
on Abstinence.

147
00:07:21.594 --> 00:07:23.187
Of course then followed by.
in the spring.

148
00:07:23.222 --> 00:07:25.222
Condoms and Choking.

149
00:07:25.257 --> 00:07:27.796
Where do you think
you're going there. hotshot?

150
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:29.534
I need to urinate.

151
00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:30.799
No way. José.

152
00:07:30.834 --> 00:07:32.394
Uh. it's Cady.

153
00:07:32.429 --> 00:07:33.802
Well. Cady.

154
00:07:33.837 --> 00:07:35.903
first thing you need to do
is ask permission.

155
00:07:35.938 --> 00:07:37.465
But the second thing
you'll need

156
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.643
is this lavatory pass

157
00:07:39.678 --> 00:07:41.645
that is shaped
like a sperm whale.

158
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.745
Get it?

159
00:07:43.308 --> 00:07:44.714
Um...

160
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:46.782
May I please have
the lavatory pass?

161
00:07:46.817 --> 00:07:49.081
No. you may not.
You may go sit back down.

162
00:07:49.116 --> 00:07:51.886
You can go at lunch.
Nice try. kiddo.

163
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:53.415
All right.
let's jump into this!

164
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.626
This won't be awkward at all.
I swear to God.

165
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.366
This one.

166
00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.305

167
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.944
Uh. yes.

168
00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:51.539
'Cause you've been in there
a very long time.

169
00:08:51.574 --> 00:08:52.980
We're concerned
you're either doing drugs

170
00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:54.212
or having a toilet baby.

171
00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:58.689

to function.

175
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:05.355
But I push through.
I manage.

176
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.829
Hi.

177
00:09:06.864 --> 00:09:07.962
We've been
watching you all day.

178
00:09:07.997 --> 00:09:09.458
You're a mess.

179
00:09:09.493 --> 00:09:13.704
So we volunteer to amplify
your lunch experience.

180
00:09:13.739 --> 00:09:16.707
Yeah. what Damian is saying is
we will help you. Caddy.

181
00:09:16.742 --> 00:09:20.777
Thanks so much.
Um... it's Cady.

182
00:09:20.812 --> 00:09:22.746
Yeah.
I'm gonna call you Caddy.

183
00:09:23.606 --> 00:09:24.847
Get out of the toilet!

184
00:09:24.882 --> 00:09:26.574
Mkay.

185
00:09:26.609 --> 00:09:29.511
You just need to find
your clique and commit to it.

186
00:09:29.546 --> 00:09:31.051
You have your Jocks.

187
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.451
Your Corny Horny Band Freaks.

188
00:09:38.929 --> 00:09:40.258
Your Classic Burnouts.

189
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.393
Do any of these feel
like your people?

190
00:09:43.428 --> 00:09:45.362
I don't think so.
Hmm...

191
00:09:45.397 --> 00:09:47.364
You know what might
be cute for her?

192
00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:48.739
What. Grade Grubbers?

193
00:09:48.774 --> 00:09:50.609
No. I was gonna say
Theater Mess.

194
00:09:56.606 --> 00:09:58.507
And who's at that table?

195
00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:00.916
Oh. no. no. no.

196
00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:02.511
We call them the Plastics

197
00:10:02.546 --> 00:10:04.249
'cause they're shiny.
fake and hard.

198
00:10:04.284 --> 00:10:05.855
Yeah. that's Gretchen Wieners.

199
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.121
She knows everything
about everybody.

200
00:10:08.156 --> 00:10:09.826
That's why
her hair's so big.

201
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:11.553
It's full of secrets.

202
00:10:11.588 --> 00:10:13.093
And that's Karen Shetty.

203
00:10:13.128 --> 00:10:14.831
She's the dumbest person
you'll ever meet.

204
00:10:14.866 --> 00:10:18.197
I once saw her put a D
in the word "orange."

205
00:10:20.905 --> 00:10:23.070
Could I just sit
with you guys?

206
00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:25.402
I actually don't know.

207
00:10:25.437 --> 00:10:26.777
We've never been asked
that question before.

208
00:10:26.812 --> 00:10:27.976
Could she?

209
00:10:28.011 --> 00:10:30.275
We are very exclusive.

210
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.751
but I think we can make
an exception.

211
00:10:35.986 --> 00:10:38.151
What was that?
Oh. Lord. it's the Queen Bee.
Don't look her in the eye!

Why don't I know you?

232
00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:23.553
I'm new. I just moved here
from Kenya.

233
00:12:23.588 --> 00:12:24.961
Shut up.

234
00:12:25.623 --> 00:12:26.831
Shut up!

235
00:12:26.866 --> 00:12:28.591
I didn't say anything.

236
00:12:28.626 --> 00:12:29.966
You're. like. really pretty.

237
00:12:31.365 --> 00:12:33.431
Thanks.
So you agree?

238
00:12:33.466 --> 00:12:34.663
You think
you're really pretty?

239
00:12:36.007 --> 00:12:37.600
Oh. I don't know.

240
00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:40.735
You're an international
student. That is so fetch.

241
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.044
What is "fetch"?

242
00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:44.948
It's like slang
from an old movie.

243
00:12:44.983 --> 00:12:48.116
<i>Juno.</i> I think.

244
00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:49.579
Have you ever touched a tiger?

245
00:12:49.614 --> 00:12:52.120
Uh. no. those aren't
indigenous to Kenya.

246
00:12:52.155 --> 00:12:54.650
'Cause that's one
of my life goals.

247
00:12:54.685 --> 00:12:57.191
To not touch a tiger.

248
00:12:57.226 --> 00:12:59.292
Hey. new girl!
You want to see a trick?

249
00:12:59.327 --> 00:13:00.898
I can guess
any girl's bra size.

250
00:13:00.933 --> 00:13:02.790
All you got to do
is jump one time.

251
00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:04.968
Ew. Jason!
Do me.

252
00:13:05.003 --> 00:13:06.563
Oh. my God. Jason.

253
00:13:06.598 --> 00:13:09.599
You do not come to a party
at my house with Gretchen

254
00:13:09.634 --> 00:13:11.436
and then skeeze on the new girl
right in front of me.

255
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:13.471
Do you want to have sex
with him?

256
00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:15.770
Oh. uh... no. thank you.

257
00:13:15.805 --> 00:13:17.079
Okay. then it's settled.

258
00:13:17.114 --> 00:13:18.410
Jason. no one thinks
you're funny.

259
00:13:18.445 --> 00:13:19.741
Okay? And this thing
you're doing

260
00:13:19.776 --> 00:13:21.083
where you lower your voice
when you talk

261
00:13:21.118 --> 00:13:22.480
is making people really sad.

262
00:13:22.515 --> 00:13:24.482
Excuse me. anyone
who would like Jason Weems

263
00:13:24.517 --> 00:13:26.484
to go back
to his normal speaking voice.

264
00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:27.452
please raise your hand.

265
00:13:31.821 --> 00:13:32.996
Yeah.

266
00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:34.965
Bitch.

267
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.560
Wow.

268
00:13:36.595 --> 00:13:38.496
You're really gonna
get noticed around here.

269
00:13:39.334 --> 00:13:40.531
We should help you.

270
00:13:42.469 --> 00:13:44.271
Can you give us some privacy
for a sec?

271
00:13:44.306 --> 00:13:46.339
Oh. Yeah. sure.

272
00:13:50.015 --> 00:13:52.147
I have your lunch!

273
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:55.414
All right.

274
00:13:55.449 --> 00:13:57.515
So. we never really
do this. but...

275
00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:58.989
...you're invited
to eat lunch with us

276
00:13:59.024 --> 00:14:01.222
for the rest of the week.
Oh. Um...

277
00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:03.521
That's okay.
On Wednesdays.
we wear pink.

278
00:14:06.658 --> 00:14:08.592
They want me to have lunch
with them all week.

279
00:14:08.627 --> 00:14:10.363
That is tits!

280
00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:12.002
She means "that's great."

281
00:14:12.037 --> 00:14:14.037
I don't really get why
you guys hate them so much.

282
00:14:14.072 --> 00:14:16.138
Regina seems kind of cool.
No. no...

283
00:14:16.173 --> 00:14:17.832
Regina George is not cool.

284
00:14:17.867 --> 00:14:19.702
She's a scum-sucking
life ruiner.

285
00:14:19.737 --> 00:14:22.342
Janis hates Regina
because when we were
in sixth grade.

286
00:14:22.377 --> 00:14:24.509
she told everybody
that she was--
Hey. Damian!

287
00:14:24.544 --> 00:14:25.576
What?

288
00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:26.742
Shall we not?

289
00:14:26.777 --> 00:14:28.183
I am providing context.

290
00:14:28.218 --> 00:14:29.349
Caddy?

291
00:14:29.384 --> 00:14:31.153
You should have lunch
with them

292
00:14:31.188 --> 00:14:33.056
and then report back
and tell us

293
00:14:33.091 --> 00:14:35.223
every stupid. moronic thing
they said.

294
00:14:35.258 --> 00:14:37.654
Spy on them? That's bad.

295
00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:39.095
No! Look at us.

296
00:14:40.395 --> 00:14:43.000
Would we ever ask you
to do something bad?

297
00:14:43.035 --> 00:14:44.628
Uh...

298
00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.973
Okay.
Yes!

299
00:14:49.008 --> 00:14:51.008
Do you have a pink shirt
I can borrow?

300
00:14:51.043 --> 00:14:53.175
No!
Yes! What shade?

301
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.507
Welcome to A.P. Calculus.

302
00:14:55.542 --> 00:15:00.743
Congratulations.
You know more math
than 85% of Americans.

303
00:15:00.778 --> 00:15:03.845
But you will not rest
on your laurels this year.

304
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.254
I plan to push you.

305
00:15:06.289 --> 00:15:07.651
So let's get started.

306
00:15:07.686 --> 00:15:10.786
Chapter One. "Limits
and Their Properties."

307
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:12.326
What the heck are limits.
you say?

308
00:15:12.361 --> 00:15:13.855
If I write out the equation.

309
00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.891
"The limit as x approaches two
of [x + 1]."

310
00:15:16.926 --> 00:15:18.761
the function is what
we're taking the limit of.

311
00:15:18.796 --> 00:15:20.631
I don't expect you to know
how to do this yet.

312
00:15:20.666 --> 00:15:21.896
The limit equals three.

313
00:15:22.536 --> 00:15:24.074
That's right.

314
00:15:24.109 --> 00:15:25.537
Let's try another one.

315
00:15:25.572 --> 00:15:27.374
Find the value of k

316
00:15:27.409 --> 00:15:29.574
for which the following
limit exists.

317
00:15:29.609 --> 00:15:31.873
K equals negative three.
Damn. girl!

318
00:15:33.646 --> 00:15:34.909
Wow.

319
00:15:36.154 --> 00:15:38.748
Are you trying to make
the rest of us feel dumb?

320
00:15:38.783 --> 00:15:41.949
No. I... I'm not trying to.
It's just. uh. happening.

321
00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:45.821
Oh. okay. it's like that.
All right. um. well...

322
00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.263

00:18:17.447 --> 00:18:18.413
I'm okay.

366
00:18:24.586 --> 00:18:27.290
Mom. you can't
pick me up like this.

367
00:18:27.325 --> 00:18:28.555
It's embarrassing.

368
00:18:31.461 --> 00:18:33.230
You can't wear a tank top
two days in a row

369
00:18:33.265 --> 00:18:36.431
and you can
only wear your hair
in a ponytail once a week.

370
00:18:36.466 --> 00:18:38.059
So I guess
you've chosen today.

371
00:18:38.094 --> 00:18:42.063
Oh! And we only wear sweats
or track pants on Fridays.

372
00:18:42.098 --> 00:18:43.900
If you break any
of these rules.

373
00:18:43.935 --> 00:18:45.176
you can't sit with us.

374
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:47.068
I mean. not just you.
like. any of us.

375
00:18:47.103 --> 00:18:48.740
Like if I wore sweatpants today.

376
00:18:48.775 --> 00:18:50.137
I'd have to
go sit over there...

377
00:18:50.172 --> 00:18:51.809
...with the Art Freaks.

378
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.077
That seems fair.

379
00:18:56.112 --> 00:18:58.618
120 calories
and 48 calories from fat.

380
00:18:58.653 --> 00:18:59.685
What percent is that?

381
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.149
Um. 48 into 120?

382
00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:03.887
There's no way of knowing.

383
00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:06.461
It's 40%.

384
00:19:06.496 --> 00:19:07.990
42 over 120

385
00:19:08.025 --> 00:19:10.124
equals x over 100.
and then you cross-multiply

386
00:19:10.159 --> 00:19:11.664
to get the value of x.

387
00:19:12.337 --> 00:19:14.205
Hmm.

388
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.965
Whatever.
Um. I'm getting cheese fries.

389
00:19:22.204 --> 00:19:24.974
So. have you seen any guys
you think are cute yet?

390
00:19:26.615 --> 00:19:30.782
Oh. um. well. actually.
there's this one guy
in my Calculus class.

391
00:19:30.817 --> 00:19:34.819
Ooh. a senior! Who is it?
Uh. Aaron Samuels.

392
00:19:34.854 --> 00:19:37.987
You can't like Aaron Samuels!
That is Regina's ex-boyfriend!
No. No. Bad. Bad. Danger.

393
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.189
Wait. I thought she
dumped him for Shane Oman.

394
00:19:42.224 --> 00:19:43.564
Irregardless!

395
00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:45.027
Ex-boyfriends are
off-limits for friends.

396
00:19:45.062 --> 00:19:46.699
That's just. like.
the rules of feminism!

397
00:19:50.969 --> 00:19:52.199
Don't worry.

398
00:19:52.234 --> 00:19:54.674
I will never tell Regina
what you said.

399
00:19:54.709 --> 00:19:56.544
I am very trustworthy.

400
00:19:56.579 --> 00:19:58.975
Karen's had sex with 11 people
and I've never told anyone.

401
00:20:00.583 --> 00:20:01.780
Yo. Golf Bird.

402
00:20:01.815 --> 00:20:04.013
Those fractions were tight.
What?

403
00:20:04.048 --> 00:20:07.324
"Caddy Heron." "Golf Bird."

404
00:20:07.359 --> 00:20:09.018
I don't like it.
I don't get it.

405
00:20:09.053 --> 00:20:12.021
I'm Kevin Ganatra.
I'm from your Calc class.

406
00:20:13.189 --> 00:20:14.991
I sit diagonally from you.

407
00:20:15.026 --> 00:20:17.191
I'm also captain
of the North Shore Mathletes.

408
00:20:17.226 --> 00:20:21.129
We're a very chill. dope.
extracurricular option.

409
00:20:21.164 --> 00:20:22.702
You know.
serve your college rezzy

410
00:20:22.737 --> 00:20:24.836
and your thirst for knolly.
Don't say "knolly."

411
00:20:24.871 --> 00:20:27.003
Also Ms. Norbury says
we get twice as much funding

412
00:20:27.038 --> 00:20:29.236
if we had a girl on the team.
so think about joining.

413
00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:31.007
because we'd love
to get jackets.

414
00:20:31.042 --> 00:20:32.910
Okay. yeah. sure.
Where do I...

415
00:20:32.945 --> 00:20:34.142
No. no.
you cannot join Mathletes.

416
00:20:34.177 --> 00:20:35.418
That is. like.
socially ruinous!

417
00:20:35.453 --> 00:20:38.355
Ew. no.
Why is he by our table?

418
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.851
I can hear you. by the way.

419
00:20:39.886 --> 00:20:41.424
Can you hear me now?

420
00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:43.888
Bye.

421
00:20:43.923 --> 00:20:47.122
Uh. anyways.
uh. just take my card
in case you change your mind?

422
00:20:53.768 --> 00:20:56.472
God. you are so lucky
you have us to guide you.

423
00:20:56.507 --> 00:20:58.705
What are you doing
after school today?

424
00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.443
I want to give you some shoes.

425
00:21:03.074 --> 00:21:04.744
What kind of shoes?

426
00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:07.450
I have no idea. I guess. um.
something fancier than these?

427
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.980
She's so rude!

428
00:21:10.015 --> 00:21:12.620
I mean. maybe
she's just being generous.

429
00:21:12.655 --> 00:21:14.820
Maybe we can have
a commensal relationship.

430
00:21:14.855 --> 00:21:17.185
What is that? I want one.

431
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.925
So. in nature.
okay. so lions.

432
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.795
they're the apex predators. right?

433
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.961
They're the top
of the food chain.

434
00:21:23.996 --> 00:21:26.370
They can kill anything
they want.

435
00:21:26.405 --> 00:21:28.570
But if you're a hyena. well.

436
00:21:28.605 --> 00:21:31.639
then you follow them around
and you eat the carcasses
that they leave behind.

437
00:21:31.674 --> 00:21:33.300
Whoa.
Gretchen Wieners is a hyena.

438
00:21:33.335 --> 00:21:34.411
Got it.

439
00:21:34.446 --> 00:21:36.413
No. I did not say that.

440
00:21:36.448 --> 00:21:38.646
I'm just saying. if you're
on Regina's good side...

441
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:40.109
Whoa. Caddy! No. no. no.

442
00:21:40.144 --> 00:21:42.309
Regina George does not have
a good side. okay?

443
00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:43.948
If you go over
to her house today...

444
00:21:43.983 --> 00:21:45.180
I am not joking.

445
00:21:46.117 --> 00:21:47.622

500
00:25:00.311 --> 00:25:03.147
Hi. Mrs. George.

501
00:25:03.182 --> 00:25:04.654
This is Cady.

502
00:25:04.689 --> 00:25:06.623
I just moved here.
From Kenya.

503
00:25:06.658 --> 00:25:11.122
Welcome. Cady from Kenya.

504
00:25:11.157 --> 00:25:14.994
We haven't had any new meat
in our little lady taco
in so long.

505
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:16.259
Mom. go make snacks.

506
00:25:16.294 --> 00:25:18.063
For sure.
For sure. Regina. yeah.

507
00:25:18.098 --> 00:25:19.768
Thank you so much.
Mrs. George.

508
00:25:19.803 --> 00:25:21.704
You have a beautiful mansion.

509
00:25:21.739 --> 00:25:25.499
Just slay. queens.
Slay like no one's watching.

510
00:25:25.534 --> 00:25:28.304
But everybody's watching.
Because you're gorgeous!

511
00:25:33.476 --> 00:25:35.619
Wow. your room is really nice.

512
00:25:35.654 --> 00:25:39.150
Thanks.
It used to be my parents'.
but I made them trade me.

513
00:25:47.127 --> 00:25:50.524
Cady! I made you
a Spotify playlist

514
00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:52.801
to help you catch up
on culture.

515
00:25:52.836 --> 00:25:56.068
Karen. come here.
I want to fix your eyebrows.

516
00:25:56.103 --> 00:25:57.201
Can I still have two?

517
00:25:57.236 --> 00:25:59.709
Gretchen. move.
Sorry.

518
00:25:59.744 --> 00:26:02.470
God. my hips are so wide.

519
00:26:02.505 --> 00:26:04.109
God. my pores are huge!

520
00:26:04.144 --> 00:26:06.078
I want skin like Cady's.

521
00:26:07.147 --> 00:26:09.213
My B.O. smells like crayons.

522
00:26:12.119 --> 00:26:15.186
Um. me. too! I'm ugly. too.

523
00:26:15.221 --> 00:26:17.661
Oh. my God. I love her.
She's like a Martian.

524
00:26:17.696 --> 00:26:19.553
Who's hungry?

525
00:26:19.588 --> 00:26:21.027
Now. Cady.

526
00:26:21.062 --> 00:26:24.558
this is a very American snack
called guac.

527
00:26:24.593 --> 00:26:26.934
Is it okay or are you vegan?

528
00:26:26.969 --> 00:26:28.969
Oh. no. I'm an omnivore.

529
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:31.037
Yum-yum-yum. Okay. come here!

530
00:26:31.072 --> 00:26:33.908
I need you
to tell me everything.

531
00:26:33.943 --> 00:26:37.010
Have you seen any boys
that you think are cute yet?

532
00:26:37.045 --> 00:26:40.310
Oh. Uh. well. I...

533
00:26:40.345 --> 00:26:41.949
No.

534
00:26:41.984 --> 00:26:44.413
Well. don't worry.
It's just a matter of time.

535
00:26:44.448 --> 00:26:48.219
You know. I always say
that this school district
has the highest taxes.

536
00:26:48.254 --> 00:26:50.859
but the hottest boys.
That's disgusting.

537
00:26:50.894 --> 00:26:53.356
Oh. Regina!
You're never gonna believe
what I found

538
00:26:53.391 --> 00:26:54.764
in your closet this morning.

539
00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:56.359
Why were you in my closet?

540
00:26:56.394 --> 00:26:58.229
Because I'm doing
that Japanese organizing thing

541
00:26:58.264 --> 00:27:00.902
where you take a little nap
in the closet.

542
00:27:02.433 --> 00:27:05.566
I found your Burn Book!

543
00:27:05.601 --> 00:27:08.470
Cady. this is just. like.
the funniest thing

544
00:27:08.505 --> 00:27:09.944
that the girls used to do.

545
00:27:09.979 --> 00:27:11.407
Please leave.
You got it. baby.

546
00:27:11.442 --> 00:27:13.178
But. girls. I'm gonna be
right downstairs

547
00:27:13.213 --> 00:27:15.081
if you need to talk to me
about anything.

548
00:27:15.116 --> 00:27:19.118
I mean it. Deep stuff
or boy troubles or blackheads

549
00:27:19.153 --> 00:27:21.450
or alcohol poisoning.

550
00:27:21.485 --> 00:27:23.617
You know. I have
been through it all.

551
00:27:23.652 --> 00:27:26.290
Honey. I am not a regular mom.

552
00:27:26.325 --> 00:27:29.260
I'm @coolmom with six O's.

553
00:27:29.295 --> 00:27:31.427
Hashtag AgingHotly. Hashtag...

554
00:27:31.462 --> 00:27:33.462
Get out.
Okay.

555
00:27:33.497 --> 00:27:35.937
Girls. just have so much fun.

556
00:27:35.972 --> 00:27:40.304
Remember.
these are the best days
of your life.

557
00:27:41.472 --> 00:27:43.538
It does not get better.

558
00:27:46.312 --> 00:27:49.720
I remember this.
It was the week they took
all of our phones away.

559
00:27:52.318 --> 00:27:55.451
"Trang Pham is
a grotsky little byotch."

560
00:27:55.486 --> 00:27:56.925
Still true.

561
00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.961
"Dawn Schweitzer
is a horny shrimp."

562
00:27:59.996 --> 00:28:01.655
Well. she's taller now.

563
00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:05.395
Oh. my God.
"Janis 'Imi'ike. Pyro-Lez."

564
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.869
I forgot about that.

565
00:28:06.904 --> 00:28:08.497
Oh. my God. she is so weird.

566
00:28:08.532 --> 00:28:10.532
She is? She's in my homeroom.

567
00:28:10.567 --> 00:28:13.568
Oh. well. watch out.
'cause she's violent.

568
00:28:13.603 --> 00:28:15.812
Yeah. people think
she's really good at art.

569
00:28:15.847 --> 00:28:17.979
but it's just 'cause
she had to do art therapy.

570
00:28:18.014 --> 00:28:20.674
Yeah. Regina tried
to be friends with her
in middle school.

571
00:28:20.709 --> 00:28:22.214
Oh. my God.
she was obsessed with me.

572
00:28:22.249 --> 00:28:24.645
And then when I got
my first boyfriend. Kyle.

573
00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.680
she lit my backpack on fire.

574
00:28:28.255 --> 00:28:29.650
Who's that?

575
00:28:29.685 --> 00:28:32.026
Mmm...
That's that kid Damian.

576
00:28:32.061 --> 00:28:34.490
Oh. yeah. he's almost too gay
to function.

577
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.164
No. I didn't... I didn't
mean that in a bad way.

578
00:28:38.199 --> 00:28:40.265
No. that's funny.
Put that in there.

579
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.398
Um...

580
00:28:42.599 --> 00:28:44.500
No. I don't...
Oh! No. no.

581
00:28:44.535 --> 00:28:46.634
Don't worry. Cady.
we only write stuff
about randos in here.

582
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:49.879
Friends are. like.
very deserving of respect.

583
00:28:49.914 --> 00:28:52.376
Gretchen... she gets it.

584
00:28:53.082 --> 00:28:54.147
Go find the shoes.

585
00:28:56.283 --> 00:28:58.580
The shoes we're giving
to Cady.

586
00:28:58.615 --> 00:29:01.990
Oh. my God. you are literally
being so annoying.

587
00:29:03.752 --> 00:29:04.619
Sorry.

588
00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:15.663
Are you okay?

589
00:29:15.698 --> 00:29:17.731
No... uh. totally.

590
00:29:17.766 --> 00:29:19.634
Regina's just joking.

591
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:21.438
These are cute. Try 'em.

592
00:29:23.706 --> 00:29:26.212
Once I processed that Regina's
love language is anger.

593
00:29:26.247 --> 00:29:27.312
it's been much...

594
00:29:28.678 --> 00:29:31.118
Aw.

595
00:29:31.153 --> 00:29:33.989
It's the music box
I gave Regina

They have this book.
this "Burn Book."

622
00:31:25.201 --> 00:31:27.300
where they write mean things
about girls in our grade.

623
00:31:27.335 --> 00:31:29.434
Ooh. ooh! What does
it say about me?

624
00:31:30.272 --> 00:31:32.371
Um... you're not in it.

625
00:31:32.901 --> 00:31:34.340
Those bitches!

626
00:31:34.375 --> 00:31:35.902
What is this. by the way?
It's terrible.

627
00:31:35.937 --> 00:31:37.607
Oh. it's a Kälteen bar.

628
00:31:37.642 --> 00:31:39.840
Here. my mom used to give them
to elderly people in Kapedo

629
00:31:39.875 --> 00:31:42.117
to help them
gain weight.
Mmm.

630
00:31:42.152 --> 00:31:43.987
I can feel it working.

631
00:31:44.022 --> 00:31:46.418
We should. like. crush this up
and put it in Regina's food!

632
00:31:46.453 --> 00:31:47.914
What?
Oh.

633
00:31:47.949 --> 00:31:49.487
No. No. no.

634
00:31:49.522 --> 00:31:51.357
I will keep having
lunch with them. that's it.

635
00:31:51.392 --> 00:31:54.525
Also. we feel bad
we yelled at you

636
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.230
about liking Aaron.

637
00:31:56.265 --> 00:31:58.562
You should go
for what you want.

638
00:31:58.597 --> 00:32:00.894
Hetero allyship.
Oh. okay.

639
00:32:00.929 --> 00:32:03.699
It's so dumb. I only
ever see him in Calc anyway.

640
00:32:03.734 --> 00:32:07.406
Oh. You're definitely
safe in Calc.

641
00:32:07.441 --> 00:32:09.276
Regina will never set foot
in there.

642
00:32:22.753 --> 00:32:24.819
New shoes?
Uh. yeah.

643
00:32:24.854 --> 00:32:26.557
Regina gave them to me.

644
00:32:26.592 --> 00:32:29.230
Huh. I didn't know
you guys were friends.

645
00:32:29.265 --> 00:32:31.067
Okay. let's get back into it.

646
00:32:31.102 --> 00:32:32.761
Continuity.
Removable discont...

647
00:32:32.796 --> 00:32:34.103
Cady? Eyes up front. please.

648
00:32:35.469 --> 00:32:37.733
Let's get back
into where we were Thursday.

649
00:32:37.768 --> 00:32:39.801
Who was awake Thursday?
Who was still awake?

650
00:32:41.508 --> 00:32:43.376
I like your jacket.

651
00:32:43.411 --> 00:32:44.740
Thanks. I made it.

652
00:32:44.775 --> 00:32:46.610
But why do you sew
on top of your drawings?

653
00:32:46.645 --> 00:32:49.481
It's... like the drawings
are facts

654
00:32:49.516 --> 00:32:50.911
and the threads are feelings.

655
00:32:50.946 --> 00:32:53.089
It's so cool.

656
00:32:55.654 --> 00:32:58.424
So. you talk to your man yet?

657
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.131
<i>I mean. I don't even
know what to say to him.</i>

658
00:33:02.166 --> 00:33:05.266
<i>I always come off sounding
like a lunatic.</i>

659
00:33:05.301 --> 00:33:07.202
Do you like gum?
Sure.

660
00:33:08.469 --> 00:33:10.964
Oh. I don't have any.
I was just...

661
00:33:10.999 --> 00:33:13.241
Oh.

662
00:33:15.872 --> 00:33:19.775
What?
Why did you say that?

663
00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:23.152
Maybe just try to have
one successful interaction
per day?

664
00:33:26.157 --> 00:33:28.454
I like your shirt.
Thanks.

665
00:33:28.489 --> 00:33:30.687
It smells like sausage
from the last time I wore it.

666
00:33:34.198 --> 00:33:36.022
Dear God. woman.

667
00:33:36.057 --> 00:33:39.399
Have you successfully been
a functioning human being
even once?

668
00:33:41.172 --> 00:33:44.668
On October 3rd.
he asked me what day it was.

669
00:33:44.703 --> 00:33:47.374
What day is it?
It's October 3rd.

670
00:33:47.409 --> 00:33:51.444
<i>♪ October 3rd ♪</i>

671
00:33:51.479 --> 00:33:53.083
That was two weeks ago.

672
00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:55.976
But today I kind of...

673
00:33:56.011 --> 00:33:57.318
I don't know.
I tried something

674
00:33:57.353 --> 00:34:00.189
and it just came to me
instinctively.

675
00:34:02.017 --> 00:34:03.522
<i>I said I was lost.</i>

676
00:34:03.557 --> 00:34:06.195
I'm totally lost.
Can you help me?

677
00:34:07.198 --> 00:34:08.692
<i>But I wasn't lost.</i>

678
00:34:08.727 --> 00:34:10.463
<i>I knew exactly what
Ms. Norbury was talking about.</i>

679
00:34:10.498 --> 00:34:14.060
It's the derivative
of the natural log function.

680
00:34:14.095 --> 00:34:16.766
You just take the reciprocal
of the ln.

681
00:34:18.473 --> 00:34:19.373
Thanks.

682
00:34:20.607 --> 00:34:22.673
You're so smart.

683
00:34:24.776 --> 00:34:25.907
<i>He was wrong.</i>

684
00:34:25.942 --> 00:34:27.645
Wait. wait. Hold up.

685
00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.581
Guys. pause!
Oh.

686
00:34:32.388 --> 00:34:34.190
You pretended to be dumb

687
00:34:34.225 --> 00:34:36.720
so you could keep talking
to a guy?

688
00:34:36.755 --> 00:34:39.591
Uh... Yeah. It worked.

689
00:34:39.626 --> 00:34:41.428
'Cause that shit
always works. Caddy.

690
00:34:41.463 --> 00:34:43.056
It doesn't mean
that it's not evil.

691
00:34:43.091 --> 00:34:46.136
Fracking "works."
Red-lining "works."

692
00:34:46.171 --> 00:34:48.138
Gasoline and rags...

693
00:34:48.173 --> 00:34:50.569
Aren't you worried
Regina will eat your face
if she finds out?

694
00:34:50.604 --> 00:34:52.373
No. she won't find out.

695
00:34:52.408 --> 00:34:55.739
It's just my little
Calculus class secret.

696
00:34:55.774 --> 00:34:58.379
Oh. um...

697
00:34:58.414 --> 00:35:01.283
So its h prime of x
equals five.

698
00:35:01.318 --> 00:35:03.252
You just forgot
the Product Rule.

699
00:35:03.287 --> 00:35:04.979

00:35:06.587 --> 00:35:07.685

Hey. my friend Chris is. uh.

703
00:35:19.996 --> 00:35:21.666
Would you want
to come to that?

704
00:35:21.701 --> 00:35:24.097
It's like a costume party.
People get pretty into it.

705
00:35:24.132 --> 00:35:25.868
Grool.

706
00:35:25.903 --> 00:35:28.772

She took Aaron back.

Of course she did.

868
00:44:49.972 --> 00:44:52.698
It's because Regina's
a life ruiner!

869
00:44:52.733 --> 00:44:54.304
When we were in sixth grade.
she told everybody

870
00:44:54.339 --> 00:44:55.877
that Janis was...
Damian!

871
00:44:55.912 --> 00:44:57.978
Okay. She does not need
to hear that right now.

872
00:44:58.013 --> 00:45:00.178
No. I know the story.

873
00:45:00.213 --> 00:45:02.851
You lit a fire 'cause Regina
got a boyfriend.

874
00:45:02.886 --> 00:45:04.446
She said what?

875
00:45:04.481 --> 00:45:05.821
Oh. hell no.

876
00:45:05.856 --> 00:45:09.286
Damian...
No! The truth
will be told.

877
00:45:09.321 --> 00:45:10.518
Stay with me. Cady.

878
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:18.427
Like all history.
this is emotionally layered
and culturally dense.

879
00:45:22.268 --> 00:45:24.873
Janis and Regina were
best friends in middle school.

880
00:45:24.908 --> 00:45:29.141
And at that time. females
expressed their identities
through collectible plushies.

881
00:45:29.176 --> 00:45:30.879
I don't know what those...

882
00:45:30.914 --> 00:45:35.180
It's these bastards.
And they were everywhere.

883
00:45:35.215 --> 00:45:38.744
Regina gave Janis a BFF set
for her birthday.

884
00:45:38.779 --> 00:45:41.021
Janis put a rainbow patch
on hers.

885
00:45:41.056 --> 00:45:42.858
This is how she came out
to her friend.

886
00:45:42.893 --> 00:45:44.288
And Regina put one
on hers. too.

887
00:45:44.323 --> 00:45:47.093
out of allyship because
she used to be human.

888
00:45:47.128 --> 00:45:52.065
Cut to eight months later.
Regina becomes obsessed
with this gross boy. Kyle!

889
00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.463
Your scale is
completely off.
Hush!

890
00:45:56.434 --> 00:45:58.698
One night. they were
all playing spin the bottle...

891
00:45:58.733 --> 00:46:01.701
And Regina was worried
that Kyle liked Karen more.

892
00:46:01.736 --> 00:46:05.078
So when she spun
and got Janis.

893
00:46:05.916 --> 00:46:07.443
Regina put on a little show.

894
00:46:11.053 --> 00:46:12.481
And Kyle was like "boing"!

895
00:46:12.516 --> 00:46:13.922
And Regina was like...

896
00:46:13.957 --> 00:46:15.352
..."I knew she would let me!

897
00:46:15.387 --> 00:46:17.827
She's. like.
obsessed with me!"

898
00:46:17.862 --> 00:46:19.257
Not okay.

899
00:46:19.292 --> 00:46:21.226
Please put this all back
in its box.

900
00:46:21.261 --> 00:46:23.063
They got into a huge fight.

901
00:46:23.098 --> 00:46:25.032
Regina started avoiding Janis
at school.

902
00:46:25.067 --> 00:46:26.902
but did she give back
that plush animal?

903
00:46:26.937 --> 00:46:29.762
Oh. no.
She took it everywhere.

904
00:46:29.797 --> 00:46:32.600
She named her "Sissy Liz"
and she made everyone say

905
00:46:32.635 --> 00:46:33.975
"good morning" to it
every day.

906
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:35.372
and it was very weird
and boring.

907
00:46:35.407 --> 00:46:36.637
Fast forward.

908
00:46:36.672 --> 00:46:38.573
One day in Science.

909
00:46:38.608 --> 00:46:41.279
Regina was making everyone
say hi to Sissy Liz.

910
00:46:41.314 --> 00:46:43.281
And Janis finally heard it.

911
00:46:43.316 --> 00:46:45.888
"Sissy Liz" was short
for "Obsessed Lesbian."

912
00:46:45.923 --> 00:46:48.990
Regina had been making fun
of Janis this entire time

913
00:46:49.025 --> 00:46:50.321
and everyone but her knew it.

914
00:46:51.357 --> 00:46:53.489
So. and this is regrettable...

915
00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:57.295
Janis took
her Bunsen burner...

916
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.827
and torched the doll.

917
00:47:01.862 --> 00:47:04.137
And Regina's backpack
caught on fire a little bit

918
00:47:04.172 --> 00:47:07.338
and Janis was kicked
out of school
for the remainder of the year.

919
00:47:07.373 --> 00:47:09.835
And the adults
didn't know why.

920
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:12.211
Janis just seemed crazy.

921
00:47:14.578 --> 00:47:16.512
I'm really sorry
that happened.

922
00:47:18.483 --> 00:47:20.054

Okay.

1043

If you and Regina are
"best friends" now.

1044
00:53:20.284 --> 00:53:23.142
then you can be in charge of
keeping all her secrets. okay?

1045
00:53:23.177 --> 00:53:26.178
For example. she gave you
those high-heel shoes
just to make fun of you

1046
00:53:26.213 --> 00:53:29.258
because she knew
you wouldn't be able
to walk in them. Sorry!

1047
00:53:29.293 --> 00:53:32.118
Also. she says
she has a nose job.

1048
00:53:32.153 --> 00:53:33.691
but that's just to distract
from the fact

1049
00:53:33.726 --> 00:53:36.188
that she had one
of her ears moved!

1050
00:53:36.223 --> 00:53:38.894
Also. she totally cheats
on Aaron.

1051
00:53:38.929 --> 00:53:41.864
Yeah. Every Tuesday.
she says she has College Prep.

1052
00:53:41.899 --> 00:53:43.536
but really she's hooking up
with Shane Oman

1053
00:53:43.571 --> 00:53:45.373
in the third-floor
janitorial closet

1054
00:53:45.408 --> 00:53:48.200

Oh. um... no. not today.

Um...

Is everything okay?

1072
00:55:16.862 --> 00:55:19.467
I'm... I'm sorry.
I'll just try harder.

1073
00:55:19.502 --> 00:55:21.260
Okay. because
if you need extra help.

1074
00:55:21.295 --> 00:55:23.328
there's a Mathletes meeting
starting in a couple minutes.

1075
00:55:23.363 --> 00:55:25.671
I can't. I'm sorry.
I have to go
to my friend Regina's house.

1076
00:55:25.706 --> 00:55:27.739
We're doing a dance
in the talent show.

1077
00:55:27.774 --> 00:55:30.137
"Rockin' Around
the Pole"?
Yeah. how did you know?

1078
00:55:30.172 --> 00:55:32.106
They do it every year.
It's like a...

1079
00:55:32.141 --> 00:55:33.844
Tradition?
Recurring nightmare.

1080
00:55:35.045 --> 00:55:37.617
Okay. I could probably
get Kevin to tutor you.

1081
00:55:37.652 --> 00:55:39.553
Well. Aaron's tutoring me now.
so...

1082
00:55:39.588 --> 00:55:42.281
Oh. he's tutoring you?
Sure. okay. well.

1083
00:55:42.316 --> 00:55:44.657
let Aaron know that the weird
thing with your quizzes

1084
00:55:44.692 --> 00:55:47.858
is that all the work is right
and only the answers are wrong.

1085
00:55:47.893 --> 00:55:50.256
Huh.
Huh.

1086
00:55:50.291 --> 00:55:53.226
Cady. I am not gonna
stop pushing you.
because I'm a pusher.

1087
00:55:53.261 --> 00:55:55.470
And I know you're smarter
than this.

1088
00:55:55.505 --> 00:55:59.837
Maybe I should just push
your seat away from Aaron's.

1089
00:55:59.872 --> 00:56:02.807
Ugh! And she was like.
"I'm a pusher. Cady.
I'm a pusher."

1090
00:56:02.842 --> 00:56:05.172
Wait. what does she even mean.
she's a "pusher"?

1091
00:56:05.207 --> 00:56:09.649
Like a drug pusher?
I don't know.
She's so weird.

1092
00:56:09.684 --> 00:56:12.454
Let it all out. honey.
Put it in the book.

1093
00:56:15.184 --> 00:56:17.349
Look at this thing!

1094
00:56:18.858 --> 00:56:21.958
I can't even see it.
It's sexy.
like a face breast.

1095
00:56:21.993 --> 00:56:25.533
It happens to me. too.
It's just the Kälteen bars
flushing your toxins.

1096
00:56:25.568 --> 00:56:27.029
Huh. Okay.

1097
00:56:27.064 --> 00:56:29.097
Well. this skin stuff
you gave me sucks!

1098
00:56:29.737 --> 00:56:31.066
Where did you get it?

1099
00:56:40.517 --> 00:56:41.714
The Paris airport.

1100
00:56:41.749 --> 00:56:43.045
Oh. "the Paris airport."

1101
00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:44.915
Well. it's garbage.
And so are you.

1102
00:56:47.755 --> 00:56:50.349
She's just grouchy
because Aaron
broke up with her.

1103
00:56:50.384 --> 00:56:51.889
He did?

1104
00:56:51.924 --> 00:56:53.462
Someone told him
about Shane.

1105
00:56:54.355 --> 00:56:56.025
Do you think it was Santa?

1106
00:56:57.127 --> 00:56:59.094
Oh...

1107
00:56:59.129 --> 00:57:01.899
Also.
all that she's been eating
are those Kälteen bars.

1108
00:57:01.934 --> 00:57:04.033
and I don't think she's pooped
in. like. two weeks.

1109
00:57:04.068 --> 00:57:05.672
Uh...

1110
00:57:05.707 --> 00:57:07.542
Hey. G. we've practiced
a bunch with Cady.

1111
00:57:07.577 --> 00:57:08.741
You want to run it once?

1112
00:57:08.776 --> 00:57:10.875
Why? I'm perfect every year.

1113
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:12.338
Mm-hmm.

1114
00:57:12.373 --> 00:57:14.549
Yeah. but it's.
uh. Cady's first time

1115
00:57:14.584 --> 00:57:16.551
and there's a bunch
of traffic patterns...

1116
00:57:16.586 --> 00:57:19.411
Stop playing with
that stupid babyish book!

1117
00:58:04.359 --> 00:58:06.568
Uh. that was
Damian Hubbard singing...

1118
00:58:06.603 --> 00:58:09.065

1119
00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.704

1120
00:58:10.739 --> 00:58:11.804

1121
00:58:13.434 --> 00:58:15.874

to run the acro?

1144
00:59:08.588 --> 00:59:10.731

gymnastics anymore

1145
00:59:10.766 --> 00:59:12.964
and when we made up this dance.
we all weighed. like. 70 pounds.

1146
00:59:12.999 --> 00:59:16.165
so maybe we should
just make sure everyone's

1148

Regina ate total shit.

1183
01:01:38.705 --> 01:01:40.375
I think people saw her nipple.

1184
01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:41.706
It's just unprofessional.

1185
01:01:41.741 --> 01:01:43.312

01:01:50.585 --> 01:01:52.222

It's not like
we like Regina anyway.

1193

She's so spoiled.

01:02:05.105 --> 01:02:07.138
Regina got what she deserves.

1197
01:02:07.173 --> 01:02:08.975
But you know. that Cady girl
was kind of cute.

1198
01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:10.042
You know. she stayed.
she waved.

1199
01:02:10.077 --> 01:02:12.407
She ate. like. house down.

1200
01:02:12.442 --> 01:02:14.277
Cady Heron was the only one
that acted normal.

1201
01:02:14.312 --> 01:02:15.850
<i>Oh. yeah.</i>
<i>I think she salvaged</i>

1202
01:02:15.885 --> 01:02:17.544
<i>the worst tradition
of the year.</i>

1203
01:02:17.579 --> 01:02:19.513
<i>Period.</i>
She was... She's kind of hot.

1204
01:02:19.548 --> 01:02:21.515
She might even be hotter
than Regina George.

1205
01:02:21.550 --> 01:02:24.386
No zits. Gum health.
American Eagle.

1206
01:02:24.421 --> 01:02:26.025
Cady doesn't even have
to wear deodorant.

1207
01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:27.587
I'm thinking of going red.

1208
01:02:27.622 --> 01:02:29.061
Okay. so. somebody sent me
this look. and I was like.

1209
01:02:29.096 --> 01:02:31.030
"Hot girls.
we are going back to red!

1210
01:02:31.065 --> 01:02:32.834
Y2K fire-crotch is back!"

1211
01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:34.660
Thank you. Cady Heron.

1212
01:02:34.695 --> 01:02:36.332
<i>Cady was looking good.</i>

1213
01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:39.137
Caddy!

1214
01:02:40.107 --> 01:02:41.766
Did you hear me?

1215
01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:44.340
What?
We did it.

1216
01:02:44.375 --> 01:02:45.770
Regina lost
her hot boyfriend.

1217
01:02:45.805 --> 01:02:47.244
She lost her status
over everyone.

1218
01:02:47.279 --> 01:02:48.883
She popped her blemish
against the stage floor.

1219
01:02:48.918 --> 01:02:50.214
That's rock bottom.

1220
01:02:51.118 --> 01:02:53.250
We can stop. We're even.

1221
01:02:53.285 --> 01:02:55.120
Finally you don't have
to talk to them anymore.

1222
01:02:55.155 --> 01:02:57.419
We can finally
have lunch together tomorrow.

1223
01:02:57.454 --> 01:02:58.992
I'm getting dumplings.

1224
01:02:59.027 --> 01:03:00.829
Unless they have pizza bagels.
then I might get both.

1225
01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.457
So good.
I can't.

1226
01:03:04.692 --> 01:03:06.593
I need one more lunch.

1227
01:03:30.322 --> 01:03:33.026
I'm sorry. Regina.
You can't sit with us.

1228
01:03:35.294 --> 01:03:36.788
What?

1229
01:03:38.033 --> 01:03:40.660
You're wearing sweatpants.
It's Thursday.

1230
01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:43.465
Whatever.
Those rules aren't real.

1231
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.005
They were real
that day I wore a vest.

1232
01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:46.633
Yeah. because that vest
was disgusting!

1233
01:03:46.668 --> 01:03:49.075
You can't sit with us!

1234
01:04:01.881 --> 01:04:04.255
These sweatpants
are all that fit me right now.

1235
01:04:07.722 --> 01:04:08.963
What do you think. Cady?

1236
01:04:16.005 --> 01:04:19.732
Sorry. Regina.
Rules are rules.

1237
01:04:21.802 --> 01:04:22.834
Fine.

1238
01:04:25.212 --> 01:04:28.081
Oh.

1239
01:04:30.415 --> 01:04:32.382
Take a picture. losers.
It'll last longer.

1240
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:42.755
And that...
...was the beginning...

1241
01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:43.690

Oh. my God.

1272
01:06:02.771 --> 01:06:06.146
Oh. my God.
so many people are texting me.

1273
01:06:06.181 --> 01:06:08.775
Should I. um. text Aaron
and congratulate him?

1274
01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:10.084
No.

1275
01:06:10.119 --> 01:06:11.910
Hey. do you want a lift
this weekend?

1276
01:06:11.945 --> 01:06:13.978
'Cause Damian's borrowing
his grandma's Jazzy.

1277
01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:15.518
A lift to what?

1278
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.621
My art show.
Didn't you just hear
Mr. Duvall talking about it?

1279
01:06:19.656 --> 01:06:22.459
Oh. that's this weekend?
Yeah.

1280
01:06:22.494 --> 01:06:26.397
Oh. shoot.
I have tickets to this thing
in Madison with my mom.

1281
01:06:26.432 --> 01:06:27.629
Uh. I'm sorry.

1282
01:06:29.666 --> 01:06:32.436
Yeah. you seem
super sad about it.

1283
01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:37.342
So. what are we doing
this weekend?

1284
01:06:37.377 --> 01:06:39.146
Why is everyone asking me
about the weekend?

1285
01:06:39.181 --> 01:06:40.609
It's Tuesday.

1286
01:06:40.644 --> 01:06:44.184
Yeah. the weekend is only...
several days away.

1287
01:06:44.219 --> 01:06:46.549
I have to go to this thing
in Madison with my mom.

1288
01:06:46.584 --> 01:06:48.353
Your mom is going away?
You should have people over.

1289
01:06:48.388 --> 01:06:50.124
No. I'm going with her.

1290
01:06:50.159 --> 01:06:53.160
Well. if you have people over.
you can invite Aaron.

1291
01:06:56.528 --> 01:06:58.099
Huh.

1292
01:06:58.134 --> 01:06:59.793
Yeah. I guess
I could get out of it.

1293
01:06:59.828 --> 01:07:01.960
But. like.

1294
01:07:01.995 --> 01:07:05.337
we would keep it small. right?
Like five or six people?

1295
01:07:05.372 --> 01:07:06.800
Yes!
Sure!

1296
01:07:06.835 --> 01:07:09.407
Why are you doing this to me?!

1297
01:07:09.442 --> 01:07:12.344
I promised my friend Janis
I'd go to her art show!

1298
01:07:12.379 --> 01:07:14.709
But. <i>binti.</i> we've had
these tickets for months.

1299
01:07:14.744 --> 01:07:16.216
You love Neil deGrasse Tyson.

1300
01:07:16.251 --> 01:07:17.349
Mom!

1301
01:07:17.384 --> 01:07:19.780
Janis is my best friend!

1302
01:07:19.815 --> 01:07:21.584
Do you not want me
to be a good friend?!

1303
01:07:21.619 --> 01:07:23.047
No! Yes! What?

1304
01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:27.194
You can. uh. stay home
on your own. I guess.

1305
01:07:27.229 --> 01:07:29.526
Hey. I'm having
a small get-together

1306
01:07:29.561 --> 01:07:32.661
at my house tomorrow night.
My mom's away. so...

1307
01:07:32.696 --> 01:07:33.992
Is Regina going?

1308
01:07:34.027 --> 01:07:36.632
No! Do you think
I'm an idiot? No.

1309
01:07:36.667 --> 01:07:38.667
It's just gonna be
a few cool people.

1310
01:07:38.702 --> 01:07:40.405
and you better be
one of them. byotch.

1311
01:07:41.573 --> 01:07:43.441
Okay. I'll be there.

1312
01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:02.955
No. no. no!

1313
01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.342
Have you seen Aaron?

1314
01:08:16.377 --> 01:08:18.102
What?
Aaron!

1315
01:08:18.137 --> 01:08:19.642
Karen?

1316
01:08:20.876 --> 01:08:21.908
Hi.

1317
01:08:26.288 --> 01:08:28.255
Whoo!

1318
01:08:35.561 --> 01:08:37.055
I've been looking for you.

1319
01:08:37.893 --> 01:08:39.497
Me as well.

1320
01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:42.335
I like your costume.
I mean. um. your dress.

1321
01:08:43.734 --> 01:08:45.602
Is this you holding
a crocodile?

1322
01:08:45.637 --> 01:08:48.473
Oh. my God.
don't look at that.
That is so embarrassing.

1323
01:08:48.508 --> 01:08:50.838
No. it's not. It's awesome.

1324
01:08:51.808 --> 01:08:53.104
You miss Kenya?

1325
01:08:53.139 --> 01:08:54.413
Yes.

1326
01:08:54.448 --> 01:08:56.008
No. I mean. I...

1327
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:58.978
Well. I miss...

1328
01:08:59.013 --> 01:09:01.420
I could see
a lot more sky there.

1329
01:09:01.455 --> 01:09:02.817
At night.

1330
01:09:02.852 --> 01:09:05.853
My mom and I used
to map the constellations.

1331
01:09:06.658 --> 01:09:08.020
The stars.

1332
01:09:16.998 --> 01:09:18.800
You still on
the treadmill. honey?

1333
01:09:18.835 --> 01:09:20.472
No. I'm over there.

1334
01:09:21.838 --> 01:09:25.213
You got any plans tonight?
It's Saturday.

1335
01:09:25.248 --> 01:09:27.677
Mom. don't bother me.

1336
01:09:27.712 --> 01:09:30.944
I know you're not
feeling your best
about your body right now.

1337
01:09:30.979 --> 01:09:35.080
but remember that real beauty
comes from the face.

1338
01:09:35.115 --> 01:09:38.721
Don't ever talk about my body!

1339
01:09:38.756 --> 01:09:40.723
Okay. okay.

1340
01:09:44.366 --> 01:09:47.895
Wait. honey. why are
you eating Kälteen bars?

1341
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:50.271
These are what
we gave Nana Joan

1342
01:09:50.306 --> 01:09:51.932
when we needed her
to gain weight.

1343
01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.694
I am drinking

1344
01:10:17.729 --> 01:10:19.762
not juice tonight.

1345
01:10:19.797 --> 01:10:21.632
I know. I can tell.

1346
01:10:22.569 --> 01:10:23.832
We should go downstairs.

1347
01:10:23.867 --> 01:10:26.406
No. no. no. sit down.
I'm amazing.

1348
01:10:32.909 --> 01:10:36.240
I think you should wear
your hair however you want.

1349
01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:38.913
I think it looks good
both ways.

1350
01:10:42.721 --> 01:10:45.656
Thank you
for inviting me tonight.

1351
01:10:45.691 --> 01:10:48.527
I think
I've spent too much time
being pissed at Regina.

1352
01:10:48.562 --> 01:10:50.089
Yeah. you really have.

1353
01:10:50.124 --> 01:10:53.092
No more liars.
I would never lie to you.

1354
01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:57.030
I mean.
I did lie to you once.

1355
01:10:57.065 --> 01:10:59.571
But you are totally
gonna laugh when I tell you.

1356
01:10:59.606 --> 01:11:01.001
Tell me what?

1357
01:11:01.036 --> 01:11:02.904
We're in here!

1358
01:11:08.208 --> 01:11:11.275
I pretended
to be bad at math

1359
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:13.915
to get you to help me.
but I'm not bad at math.

1360
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:16.588
I'm actually... I'm actually
really good at math.

1361
01:11:16.623 --> 01:11:20.493
You're the one who's only
kind of okay at math.

1362
01:11:20.528 --> 01:11:22.792
Anyways. um.
now I'm failing.

1363
01:11:22.827 --> 01:11:26.796
So isn't that so dumb?
That is dumb. yeah.

1364
01:11:27.931 --> 01:11:29.469
Why wouldn't you
just talk to me?

1365
01:11:29.504 --> 01:11:31.438
Because of Regina.

1366

Shut up. Not her property.

1367
01:11:33.508 --> 01:11:34.771
Don't tell me to shut up.

1368
01:11:36.445 --> 01:11:38.808

01:21:28.696 --> 01:21:30.069
Everybody up.

1538
01:21:32.766 --> 01:21:35.041
I'm gonna kill you.

1539
01:21:35.076 --> 01:21:37.901
'Cause one thing
I know for sure. guys:

1540
01:21:37.936 --> 01:21:41.872
Calling someone "ugly" is not
gonna make you better looking.

1541
01:21:41.907 --> 01:21:45.480
Calling somebody else "stupid"
does not make you any smarter.

1542
01:21:45.515 --> 01:21:48.153
And we as women have
to be able to trust

1543
01:21:48.188 --> 01:21:50.749
and support each other.

1544
01:21:50.784 --> 01:21:51.849
Like this.

1545
01:21:55.591 --> 01:21:57.228
Okay. that was good.
That was really good.

1546
01:21:57.263 --> 01:21:59.560
That could have
really backfired.

1547
01:21:59.595 --> 01:22:01.199
Alyssa.

1548
01:22:01.234 --> 01:22:03.003
I'm sorry I said you look
like you comb your hair

1549
01:22:03.038 --> 01:22:04.070
with a chicken bone.

1550
01:22:05.898 --> 01:22:07.942
I know you're vegetarian.

1551
01:22:11.574 --> 01:22:14.608
Gretchen. I'm sorry I
laughed at you that time
you got diarrhea

1552
01:22:14.643 --> 01:22:16.775
on the Ferris wheel.

1553
01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:18.909
And I'm sorry
for repeating it now.

1554
01:22:18.944 --> 01:22:21.054
And I'm sorry to the people
who were below us.

1555
01:22:24.224 --> 01:22:25.454
Soona.

1556
01:22:25.489 --> 01:22:27.258
I'm sorry I said
you were dragging

1557
01:22:27.293 --> 01:22:29.392
during "Revenge Party."

1558
01:22:29.427 --> 01:22:31.229
There was just. like.
so much pressure on us

1559
01:22:31.264 --> 01:22:33.066
to move the story forward
through montage.

1560
01:22:33.101 --> 01:22:34.166
Like. you know how it is.

1561
01:22:34.201 --> 01:22:36.630
What is going on?

1562
01:22:36.665 --> 01:22:37.961
Don't worry about it.

1563
01:22:37.996 --> 01:22:40.073
I just wish
we could all get along

1564
01:22:40.108 --> 01:22:42.273
like we used to
in elementary school.

1565
01:22:42.308 --> 01:22:44.737
I wish
I could bake a cake

1566
01:22:44.772 --> 01:22:48.114
made out of rainbows
and smiles.

1567
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:50.710
Then we could all eat it
and be happy.

1568
01:22:50.745 --> 01:22:53.020
She don't even go here!

1569
01:22:54.254 --> 01:22:55.946
Do you go to this school?

1570
01:22:55.981 --> 01:22:58.619
I'm here for a track meet.

1571
01:22:58.654 --> 01:23:00.951
I just have a lot of feelings!

1572
01:23:00.986 --> 01:23:02.986
Okay. sweetheart.
you got to go home.

1573
01:23:03.021 --> 01:23:05.131
Okay.

1574
01:23:05.166 --> 01:23:06.693
Come on. we're gonna...
Oh. thank you.

1575
01:23:06.728 --> 01:23:08.299
...we're gonna call
your grown-up.

1576
01:23:08.994 --> 01:23:10.565
My turn. I guess.

1577
01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.534
Watch. this is either gonna be
some really crappy art

1578
01:23:12.569 --> 01:23:13.964
or really good fire.

1579
01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:23.215
Okay. sure.

1580
01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:25.052
I have an apology.

1581
01:23:26.484 --> 01:23:28.484
My friend and I thought
it would be fun

1582
01:23:28.519 --> 01:23:31.355
to mess up
Regina George's life.

1583
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:33.621
So we got
these candy-bar things

1584
01:23:33.656 --> 01:23:35.293
to make her gain weight...

1585
01:23:35.328 --> 01:23:38.131
...and we told her lard
was face cream.

1586
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:42.564
And we turned her best friends
against her.

1587
01:23:43.567 --> 01:23:45.303
And then my friend Cady...

1588
01:23:45.338 --> 01:23:47.866
Yeah. you all know
my friend Cady.

1589
01:23:47.901 --> 01:23:52.970
She got Regina's boyfriend
to dump her!

1590
01:23:53.005 --> 01:23:54.675
Oh!

1591
01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:56.039
And it turns out.

1592
01:23:56.074 --> 01:23:57.909
Cady's actually
just as selfish

1593
01:23:57.944 --> 01:24:00.615
and phony as Regina George.

1594
01:24:02.256 --> 01:24:04.289
So this apology is to myself.

1595
01:24:05.589 --> 01:24:07.391

known better.

Regina. I'm so sorry!
I didn't mean to hurt you!

1653
01:26:44.077 --> 01:26:46.550

Regina George died.

1658
01:27:10.037 --> 01:27:13.709
Again. no one died!

1659
01:27:13.744 --> 01:27:16.448
I mean. technically. Regina
did die for. like. 15 seconds

1660
01:27:16.483 --> 01:27:18.384
but then she was revived.

1661
01:27:18.419 --> 01:27:21.585
And of course.
the rumor mill
started going insane.

1662
01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:24.082
<i>I just saw
Regina get hit by a bus.</i>

1663
01:27:24.117 --> 01:27:26.491
<i>An artery come out
of her neck and her head
went all the way around!</i>

1664
01:27:26.526 --> 01:27:28.020
<i>Guys. street safety
is so important.</i>

1665
01:27:28.055 --> 01:27:29.791
I'm just sad. like.
that's all I can say.

1666
01:27:33.929 --> 01:27:35.731
We are sending
our love and prayers...

1667
01:27:35.766 --> 01:27:38.162
Link in bio to my GoFundMe
page to raise money.

1668
01:27:38.197 --> 01:27:39.405
Regina. we knew
you would pull through.

1669
01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.000
How do I get this
off my algorithm?

1670
01:27:41.035 --> 01:27:42.870
I'm not one
to spread rumors.

1671
01:27:42.905 --> 01:27:45.037
but I'm pretty sure I saw Cady
push her right in front of it.

1672
01:27:45.072 --> 01:27:46.973
On my life. Cady pushed her.

1673
01:27:47.008 --> 01:27:49.514
I literally saw Cady
push Regina.

1674
01:27:49.549 --> 01:27:51.417
Don't fill up my comments.
but... karma.

1675
01:27:51.452 --> 01:27:54.552
Girls are made deranged
by what's called hormones.

1676
01:27:54.587 --> 01:27:55.883
Hormones.

1677
01:27:55.918 --> 01:28:00.294
W-H-O-R...

1678
01:28:06.225 --> 01:28:08.434
F that bitch.
<i>F that wench.</i>

1679
01:28:15.839 --> 01:28:17.410
All right.

1680
01:28:17.445 --> 01:28:21.447
Ms. Norbury is on a. uh.
temporary leave of absence.

1681
01:28:21.482 --> 01:28:23.108
Jail.
Hey.

1682
01:28:23.143 --> 01:28:25.814
I heard that. Miss Rockwell.

1683
01:28:25.849 --> 01:28:28.487
Anyways. we're not sure
who your substitute...

1684
01:28:28.522 --> 01:28:30.324
I did it.

1685
01:28:32.658 --> 01:28:35.659
I wrote that Ms. Norbury is
a drug pusher. and it's a lie.

1686
01:28:46.166 --> 01:28:49.134
Three-week suspension.

1687
01:28:49.169 --> 01:28:52.478
This is not
who I know you to be.

1688
01:28:52.513 --> 01:28:53.479
I know.

1689
01:28:57.716 --> 01:28:59.243
Where is my Ndebele vase?

1690
01:28:59.278 --> 01:29:02.279
What?
What do you mean. what?

1691
01:29:02.314 --> 01:29:05.084
You know. the colorful vase
that's always in that window.

1692
01:29:05.119 --> 01:29:06.459
Where is it?

1693
01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.829
I had some friends over
when you were away.

1694
01:29:13.864 --> 01:29:15.127
Go.

1695
01:29:15.162 --> 01:29:16.766
Go do your homework!

1696
01:29:16.801 --> 01:29:18.735
Um. also...

1697
01:29:20.266 --> 01:29:22.640
I need you to sign
my Calculus test.

1698
01:29:22.675 --> 01:29:23.872
'cause I'm failing.

1699
01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:56.608
Hey.

1700
01:29:56.643 --> 01:29:59.578
I guess you'll need this back
to set an alarm for tomorrow.

1701
01:30:00.372 --> 01:30:02.042
Don't want it.

1702
01:30:02.077 --> 01:30:04.275
You only have one message.

1703
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:06.948
From someone named Karen.
who says:

01:30:06.983 --> 01:30:10.116
"Donut worry.
I am still your freend."

1705
01:30:14.529 --> 01:30:16.727
How bad is it gonna
be tomorrow?

1706
01:30:16.762 --> 01:30:18.498
I was thinking maybe
I should go back

1707
01:30:18.533 --> 01:30:20.159
to being homeschooled.

1708
01:30:20.194 --> 01:30:21.259
Sweetie. no.

1709
01:30:21.294 --> 01:30:22.997
It's too small. me and you.

1710
01:30:23.032 --> 01:30:24.933
And I think
you're learning things now

1711
01:30:24.968 --> 01:30:26.803
that I don't know
how to teach.

1712
01:30:33.075 --> 01:30:34.481
Good night.

1713
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:37.275
Mom?
Hmm?

1714
01:30:39.015 --> 01:30:43.116
Can you sit with me
till I fall asleep?

1715
01:30:43.921 --> 01:30:44.920
Mm-hmm.

1716
01:30:56.329 --> 01:30:58.472
Oh. sweetie.

1717
01:31:18.791 --> 01:31:21.286
Oh. hi. Did you want
to buy some drugs?

1718
01:31:21.321 --> 01:31:24.091
No. I was just handing
my quiz back.

1719
01:31:24.126 --> 01:31:26.896
You know. when the police
tore apart my house

1720
01:31:26.931 --> 01:31:28.601
looking for imaginary heroin.

1721
01:31:28.636 --> 01:31:31.494
I found this old calculator
that I thought I lost. so...

1722
01:31:31.529 --> 01:31:33.034
totally worth it.

1723
01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:35.201
I'm really sorry.

1724
01:31:35.236 --> 01:31:36.939
Thank you.

1725
01:31:36.974 --> 01:31:38.809
But I know you didn't write
that whole book yourself.

1726
01:31:38.844 --> 01:31:40.206
You gonna tell Mr. Duvall
who did?

1727
01:31:41.506 --> 01:31:42.879
No.

1728
01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:44.980
Trying this new thing
where I don't talk

1729
01:31:45.015 --> 01:31:46.509
about people
behind their backs.

1730
01:31:46.544 --> 01:31:49.721
Getting hit by a bus seems
like enough punishment.

1731
01:31:51.054 --> 01:31:53.384
100.
Welcome back. nerd.

1732
01:31:55.355 --> 01:31:57.795
Will you be attending
the Spring Fling this weekend?

1733
01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:00.127
No. Everyone hates me.

1734
01:32:00.162 --> 01:32:02.360
Perfect. because
I figured out a way for you

1735
01:32:02.395 --> 01:32:03.702
to earn some extra credit.

1736
01:32:03.737 --> 01:32:05.495
Hey. Bird.
you ready to suit up

1737
01:32:05.530 --> 01:32:07.574
and show off
your math schquills?

1738
01:32:07.609 --> 01:32:09.609
Kev. stop trying
to make "schquills" happen.
It's not gonna happen.

1739
01:32:09.644 --> 01:32:12.678
Jacob. get off my dick.
Hey! PG-13. please.

1740
01:32:30.423 --> 01:32:33.028
Welcome to the ICMT
State Math Championships.

1741
01:32:33.063 --> 01:32:34.898
Sponsored by SeatGeek.

1742
01:32:34.933 --> 01:32:36.559
Yeah. SeatGeek!

1743
01:32:36.594 --> 01:32:38.198
Tonight will be
the culmination

1744
01:32:38.233 --> 01:32:41.135
of all you've worked for.

1745
01:32:41.170 --> 01:32:43.203
Each right answer
will be worth two points.

1746
01:32:43.238 --> 01:32:46.910
The highest score at the end
of 40 minutes of play wins.

1747
01:32:46.945 --> 01:32:49.781
As always. no calculators.

1748
01:32:51.081 --> 01:32:54.016
Question one.
Two. three. four!

1749
01:32:59.089 --> 01:33:02.057
Determine the equation of
the tangent line to the graph.

1750
01:33:03.357 --> 01:33:05.522
The answer is B.
Correct.

1751
01:33:05.557 --> 01:33:08.525
Solve the equation above
using prime numbers.

1752
01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:10.637
Prime factor 41.

1753
01:33:10.672 --> 01:33:12.199
Correct.

1754
01:33:12.234 --> 01:33:13.937
Please solve for x.

1755
01:33:13.972 --> 01:33:16.236
x = 2?
Incorrect.

1756
01:33:16.271 --> 01:33:17.941
x is greater
than the value of y.

1757
01:33:17.976 --> 01:33:19.679
Correct.

1758
01:33:21.243 --> 01:33:23.507

1763
01:33:36.654 --> 01:33:37.862
Negative two!

1764
01:33:37.897 --> 01:33:38.929
Correct.

1765
01:33:38.964 --> 01:33:40.667

Both polynomials
are second degree.

1771
01:33:54.507 --> 01:33:56.078
so the asymptote is at y = 5.

1772
01:33:56.113 --> 01:33:57.783

01:34:13.526 --> 01:34:14.899
True.

1782
01:34:14.934 --> 01:34:16.098
29?

1783
01:34:16.133 --> 01:34:17.264
The slope is zero.

1784
01:34:17.299 --> 01:34:18.595
Incorrect.

1785
01:34:18.630 --> 01:34:20.102
The slope
of the tangent line is four.

1786
01:34:20.137 --> 01:34:22.940
Excellent.

1787
01:34:22.975 --> 01:34:25.602
Well. this has only ever
happened once before.

1788
01:34:25.637 --> 01:34:28.781
Ladies and gentlemen.
we have a tie.

1789
01:34:30.983 --> 01:34:32.411
In the event of a tie.

1790
01:34:32.446 --> 01:34:35.018
we move into a one-on-one
sudden-death round

1791
01:34:35.053 --> 01:34:37.086
where each team
may choose their opponent.

1792
01:34:43.655 --> 01:34:45.160
We pick the girl.

1793
01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:48.559
We pick the girl. too.

1794
01:34:51.399 --> 01:34:53.872
Ms. Krafft. Ms. Heron.
please step forward.

1795
01:35:10.484 --> 01:35:13.485
Nice to meet you.
Whatever. slut.

1796
01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.994
Contestants. please find
the limit of this expression.

1797
01:35:21.693 --> 01:35:23.726
You know.
it's not me against you.

1798
01:35:23.761 --> 01:35:26.971
It's North Shore
versus Marymount.

1799
01:35:28.106 --> 01:35:30.073
A very wise teacher...

1800
01:35:30.108 --> 01:35:31.569
The limit is negative one.

1801
01:35:33.078 --> 01:35:34.781
That answer is incorrect.

1802
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:40.182
If Ms. Heron
can answer correctly.
we have a winner.

1803
01:35:40.217 --> 01:35:43.020
You got this. Golf Bird.

1804
01:35:43.055 --> 01:35:46.023
Why can't I remember
anything about limits?

1805
01:35:46.058 --> 01:35:48.025
Honey. I don't know your life.

1806
01:35:49.688 --> 01:35:51.798
Why did you waste time
insulting me?

1807
01:35:51.833 --> 01:35:53.723
Why did I waste time
judging your hair?

1808
01:35:53.758 --> 01:35:55.428
This is not a competition.

1809
01:35:56.299 --> 01:35:58.167
It kind of is. though.

1810
01:35:58.202 --> 01:35:59.729
Right.

1811
01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.940
A math one.

Our new state champions.
the North Shore Mathletes.

1822
01:36:34.436 --> 01:36:35.908
Yeah. you like that.
Marymount?

1823
01:36:35.943 --> 01:36:38.306
Get some! Get some!

1824
01:36:38.341 --> 01:36:40.044

Have you seen Jason?

1832
01:36:55.963 --> 01:36:57.996
Like right now
or like ever in life?

1833
01:36:58.031 --> 01:36:59.591
Ohhh. miss!

1834
01:36:59.626 --> 01:37:02.000
I'm supposed to hang
with my fallback in there

1835
01:37:02.035 --> 01:37:03.496
but. you know.
if you wanted to slip out.

1836
01:37:03.531 --> 01:37:05.663
meet in my Jeep or...
Jason!

1837
01:37:05.698 --> 01:37:07.137
It's me!

1838
01:37:07.172 --> 01:37:08.633
"Fallback"?

1839
01:37:08.668 --> 01:37:10.877
No. I... I know.
Yeah. I knew the whole time.

1840
01:37:10.912 --> 01:37:13.011
No. we are done!

1841
01:37:13.046 --> 01:37:14.243
Because you know what?

1842
01:37:14.278 --> 01:37:18.214
I have a 140 IQ.
very toned legs.

1843
01:37:18.249 --> 01:37:20.315
and my parents love me!

1844
01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:22.416
And you will regret this
when you're old

1845
01:37:22.451 --> 01:37:24.891
because I am fricking fetch!

1846
01:37:24.926 --> 01:37:27.586
That's how you use it.
Come on.

1847
01:37:29.689 --> 01:37:31.557
Okay. attention. everybody.

1848
01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:35.495
Whoo-hoo-hoo.
let's go!

1849
01:37:42.834 --> 01:37:43.877
Regina!

1850
01:37:46.871 --> 01:37:48.409
You look pretty.

1851
01:37:50.809 --> 01:37:52.985
I'm wearing
a corrective neck collar.

1852
01:37:59.488 --> 01:38:02.819
I'm sorry about the bus.
I feel like it's all my fault.

1853
01:38:02.854 --> 01:38:05.228
No... No. it's not your fault.

1854
01:38:05.263 --> 01:38:07.967
Cady. don't apologize for
things that aren't your fault.

1855
01:38:08.002 --> 01:38:10.464
But. yeah.
I forgive you. 'cause...

1856
01:38:12.369 --> 01:38:14.204
I'm on a lot
of pain medication right now.

1857
01:38:14.239 --> 01:38:16.976
You know I died
for 15 seconds?

1858
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:18.043
Yeah.

1859
01:38:19.673 --> 01:38:23.675
Anyway. my mom was really
pumped to be on the news.

1860
01:38:25.019 --> 01:38:26.414
It's weird
when people treat you

1861
01:38:26.449 --> 01:38:27.712
like you're famous
or something.

1862
01:38:27.747 --> 01:38:30.088
It's amazing.

1863
01:38:30.123 --> 01:38:31.452
Until it's not.

1864
01:38:33.258 --> 01:38:37.194
Look. I...
I know I have to change.

1865
01:38:38.296 --> 01:38:40.461
And I was harsh.

1866
01:38:40.496 --> 01:38:42.232
And people say
that I'm a bitch.

1867
01:38:42.267 --> 01:38:44.861
You know what they would
call me if I was a boy?

1868
01:38:44.896 --> 01:38:47.831
Strong.
"Reginald."

1869
01:38:47.866 --> 01:38:51.736
That's what my mom was gonna
name me if I was a boy. so...

1870
01:38:51.771 --> 01:38:54.772
Honestly.
I would rather be "bitch."

1871
01:39:00.648 --> 01:39:02.846
I like you.

1872
01:39:02.881 --> 01:39:05.717
But this medicine
makes me like everyone. so...

1873
01:39:05.752 --> 01:39:07.994
Okay.
do we have all of our nominees

1874
01:39:08.029 --> 01:39:10.656
for the Spring Fling
King and Queen onstage?

1875
01:39:10.691 --> 01:39:13.032
I just want to say
you're all winners.

1876
01:39:13.067 --> 01:39:18.235
And I am retiring as soon
as this evening is over.

1877
01:39:19.601 --> 01:39:22.305
The winner
of the Spring Fling King is...

1878
01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:24.142
Shane Oman.

1879
01:39:26.179 --> 01:39:27.805
Whoo! Yeah!

1880
01:39:31.184 --> 01:39:32.216
Hey.

1881
01:39:33.813 --> 01:39:35.813
Um. have you seen Janis?

1882
01:39:35.848 --> 01:39:38.090
Every day since 2009.

1883
01:39:38.125 --> 01:39:39.586
But she doesn't want
to see you.

1884
01:39:39.621 --> 01:39:42.193
And
your Spring Fling Queen...

1885
01:39:42.228 --> 01:39:44.987
Damian. I'm...
I'm really sorry.

1886
01:39:45.022 --> 01:39:47.330
Cady Heron.

1887
01:39:47.365 --> 01:39:50.069
What?
I mean. of course she is.

1888
01:39:52.469 --> 01:39:54.040
Go. Cady!

1889
01:39:55.637 --> 01:39:56.867
Where is Cady?

1890
01:40:11.422 --> 01:40:12.685
Congratulations.

1891
01:40:16.691 --> 01:40:17.723
Um...

1892
01:40:18.957 --> 01:40:20.891
I think people voted for me

1893
01:40:20.926 --> 01:40:22.431
because they think
I pushed someone

1894
01:40:22.466 --> 01:40:23.795
in front of a bus.

1895
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:27.040
It's not your fault.
A bus pushed me.

1896
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:34.146
But what is my fault is

1897
01:40:34.181 --> 01:40:35.708
the way I treated my friends.

1898
01:40:37.514 --> 01:40:40.548
I used you and I lied to you
and I'm... I'm so sorry.

1899
01:40:44.048 --> 01:40:46.686
I'm also sorry to everyone

1900
01:40:46.721 --> 01:40:48.754
whose feelings got hurt
from the Burn Book.

1901
01:40:48.789 --> 01:40:50.360
You know.
it's really not required

1902
01:40:50.395 --> 01:40:51.988
for you to make a speech.

1903
01:40:52.023 --> 01:40:54.100
Right. Almost done.
I promise. Um...

1904
01:40:55.268 --> 01:40:59.204
I think everyone looks
like royalty tonight.

1905
01:40:59.239 --> 01:41:04.770
It just seems weird
for one person to win this.

1906
01:41:07.412 --> 01:41:10.083
I mean.
it's just a chunk of plastic.

1907
01:41:12.351 --> 01:41:14.945

Are you still mad at me?

1932
01:42:45.609 --> 01:42:47.972
I don't know.
Are you still an asshole?

1933
01:42:48.843 --> 01:42:50.249
I don't think so?

1934
01:42:56.587 --> 01:42:58.015

Would you look over there?
Oh. my gosh!

1941
01:43:21.876 --> 01:43:24.041
Do you want to dance?
Yeah.

1942
01:43:29.081 --> 01:43:31.950
Congrats on winning state.
The jacket looks. uh.
really good on you.

1943
01:43:31.985 --> 01:43:35.624

<i>Ms. Norbury and

1953

1954
01:44:04.853 --> 01:44:07.920
<i>of dancing with theater boys.</i>

1955
01:44:07.955 --> 01:44:11.759

01:44:28.074 --> 01:44:30.074
And even the people

1963
01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:32.582
are still people
who just want to coexist.

1964
