3
00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:38.182
Regina. I am prepared to depart.
Have my project brought up.

4
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.783
<i>Yes. Mr. Wenan.</i>

5
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.733
Billy. I just got word

6
00:01:57.862 --> 00:02:01.126
that your father will not be
joining us for Christmas.

7
00:02:01.255 --> 00:02:03.686
Oh. I know. sweetie.

8
00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:06.598
It's... his work.

9
00:02:06.726 --> 00:02:07.686
It's unfortunate.

10
00:02:07.814 --> 00:02:10.534
I was really looking
forward to seeing John.

11
00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:15.270
I'm sorry that I won't be able
to be there for you today.

12
00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:17.765
It's okay. Grandma.

13
00:02:18.118 --> 00:02:19.270
Come here.

14
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.134
You know what would
look good here?

15
00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:27.429
Another ribbon.

16
00:02:27.557 --> 00:02:29.894
Bring home the blue.
Billy.

17
00:02:30.022 --> 00:02:32.998
I will. Grandmother.
because that's what winners do.

18
00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:35.045
Oh. that's my boy.

19
00:02:35.173 --> 00:02:37.957
And we'll send a picture
to your father afterwards.

20
00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:39.526
Hmm?

21
00:02:43.174 --> 00:02:45.541
Please be a dear
and get me a glass of milk.

22
00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:47.046
Of course. Grandma.

23
00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:48.549
Thank you.

24
00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:59.910
- Regina.
- Yes. Mr. Wenan.

25
00:03:00.037 --> 00:03:02.438
I need this letter
mailed overnight.

26
00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:03.973
Of course.

27
00:03:04.102 --> 00:03:05.989
I'll be back in
approximately four hours.

28
00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:07.653
Otherwise. I can be reached
on my phone.

29
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.054
Oh. and. um. Regina.

30
00:03:10.182 --> 00:03:12.230
Grandmother would like
a glass of milk.

31
00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.022
Of course. sir.

32
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.366
Working something out.
love?

33
00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:53.062
Yeah.

34
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.942
I finished up early
on the day's orders.

35
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.830
so I figured
I'd get in some practice.

36
00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.774
This is our lowest year
on record.

37
00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:04.485
Yeah. we've had slumps before.
It'll pick back up.

38
00:04:05.253 --> 00:04:07.878
And the supply bill
next month?

39
00:04:08.006 --> 00:04:09.766
We can't run up
any more credit.

40
00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:13.318
Try not to worry.

41
00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:15.877
Just trying to keep things
in perspective.

42
00:04:16.582 --> 00:04:17.670
I'll head
into town tomorrow

43
00:04:17.797 --> 00:04:19.270
and check on the late entries.

44
00:04:19.398 --> 00:04:20.613
I'll look at the PO box.

45
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:22.533
They've assured me
our check's in the mail.

46
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:23.942
All right.

47
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.990
I'll make cookies
for the drive.

48
00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.582
That'd be nice.

49
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.110
You have fun
shooting the trash.

50
00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:32.806
Yes. ma'am.

51
00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:48.774
<i>Yes?</i>

52
00:04:48.902 --> 00:04:51.078
Hi. uh. it's Donald.
Is this. uh...

53
00:04:59.814 --> 00:05:00.965
Hi.

54
00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:02.214
Merry Christmas.

55
00:05:02.342 --> 00:05:04.773
Do you have
something for me?

56
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.717
Uh. yeah.
Yes. Yes. I do.

57
00:05:17.478 --> 00:05:19.878
Well. walk over here
and bring it to the table.

58
00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:23.270
Uh... yeah. Um...

59
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:25.286
On the mat.

60
00:05:38.822 --> 00:05:43.366
So. uh. how long does this
usually take?

61
00:05:43.494 --> 00:05:45.606
As long as it takes.

62
00:05:49.925 --> 00:05:51.558
Is there a place
I can sit?

63
00:05:51.686 --> 00:05:54.342
Does it look like there's
someplace that you can sit?

64
00:05:57.414 --> 00:05:59.270
Does this belong to you?

65
00:05:59.398 --> 00:06:03.078
Uh. yeah. I got it for
Christmas when I was 11.

66
00:06:09.414 --> 00:06:12.390
Eleven. Eleven.
That's great.

67
00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:15.334
You know. I never got
what I asked for.

68
00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:18.661
Are you
a baseball player?

69
00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:20.966
Uh. yeah. yeah.
Yeah. I am.

70
00:06:22.342 --> 00:06:23.430
You're an athlete?

71
00:06:23.558 --> 00:06:24.934
I mean. I was.

72
00:06:25.062 --> 00:06:29.734
I. uh. blew my ACL out in
college. like. 15 years ago.

73
00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:32.070
- Why are you selling it now?
- I don't really wanna.

74
00:06:32.198 --> 00:06:37.254
But my little girl wants to go to
space camp. so. uh. we can't afford it.

75
00:06:37.382 --> 00:06:41.958
What do you think
your childhood dream is worth?

76
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.598
2.000.

77
00:06:47.686 --> 00:06:49.894
I'll give you
$900 for it.

78
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.766
That's not even
gonna get me halfway there.

79
00:06:53.894 --> 00:06:57.382
I will give you $900 for
it or you can fuck off.

80
00:07:06.437 --> 00:07:08.998
Hydroelectric power
is an abundant energy source

81
00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:11.206
and the underlying thesis
of my project.

82
00:07:11.334 --> 00:07:14.150
- How long did this take you?
- Two weeks of conceptualizing

83
00:07:14.278 --> 00:07:15.494
and ten days
of actual building.

84
00:07:15.622 --> 00:07:17.190
How'd you come up
with this?

85
00:07:17.318 --> 00:07:20.390
After I realized the amount of
power within a flowing water source.

86
00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:22.086
the rest was elementary.

87
00:07:22.214 --> 00:07:24.198
Congratulations.
Christine.

88
00:07:24.325 --> 00:07:28.262
Oh. you have made Chester Elementary very proud.

89
00:07:37.222 --> 00:07:39.846
You just beat four-time champion
Billy Wenan. What do you have to say?

90
00:07:39.974 --> 00:07:41.638
I couldn't have asked for
a better Christmas present.

91
00:07:41.766 --> 00:07:43.942
Thank you to everyone.
especially my mom and dad.

92
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.638
- Congrats again.
- Thank you.

93
00:07:45.766 --> 00:07:47.910
- Billy!
- Excuse me. Judge Robinson. I think I got the wrong...

94
00:07:48.038 --> 00:07:50.694
Oh. we've got. uh.
Billy right here.

95
00:07:50.821 --> 00:07:52.773
Let's get a shot
with the runner-up.

96
00:07:52.902 --> 00:07:54.502
All right. let's get
the runner-up out here.

97
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.678
- I've got the wrong...
- Come on. Hold that ribbon up high.

98
00:07:56.806 --> 00:07:58.277
You two get snuggly.
Look at me.

99
00:07:58.406 --> 00:08:01.061
Pretend like there's a little
squirrel's nest on my head.

100
00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:08.837
Bye. Billy!
Have a good Christmas!

101
00:08:17.477 --> 00:08:19.494
- Roger.
- Yes. Mr. Wenan.

102
00:08:20.326 --> 00:08:22.662
I have some more work
for that friend of ours.

103
00:08:22.789 --> 00:08:24.422
I'll put you in contact.
sir.

104
00:08:24.549 --> 00:08:26.086
Thank you.

105
00:09:30.886 --> 00:09:32.454
All right. I can talk.

106
00:09:32.582 --> 00:09:34.502
What exactly
does this entail?

107
00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:38.854
I see.
All right. uh...

108
00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.798
You got a name?

109
00:09:44.934 --> 00:09:46.405
How much?

110
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.334
Yeah. Yeah. I understand.

111
00:09:52.038 --> 00:09:54.054
Job accepted.

112
00:09:54.182 --> 00:09:57.062
I gotta go.
I'm on another gig.

113
00:10:13.767 --> 00:10:16.933
<i>...we ask ourselves the real question.
Is Santa making a difference anymore?</i>

114
00:10:17.062 --> 00:10:19.045
<i>Here we have a story
out of North Carolina.</i>

115
00:10:19.174 --> 00:10:21.062
<i>Two children said
they were just having fun</i>

116
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.237
<i>when they dropped a bowling
ball off the Hickerson overpass.</i>

117
00:10:23.367 --> 00:10:24.998
<i>This caused a 30-car pileup.</i>

118
00:10:25.126 --> 00:10:27.110
<i>Next hour. we're gonna be
talking to an Oregon man who says</i>

119
00:10:27.238 --> 00:10:30.278
<i>a group of schoolchildren
burned his house to the ground.</i>

120
00:10:54.917 --> 00:10:56.326
Merry Christmas. Chris.

121
00:10:56.454 --> 00:10:59.429
Ah. schoolkids are lighting
their uncles on fire

122
00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:02.886
and throwing bowling balls
off of bridges.

123
00:11:03.013 --> 00:11:05.254
Nothing too merry
about that.

124
00:11:08.838 --> 00:11:11.045
Got two more crates
for you in back.

125
00:11:12.197 --> 00:11:13.669
I'll bring the truck around.

126
00:11:13.798 --> 00:11:15.366
All right.
I'll get 'em ready.

127
00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:25.893
Hey. Chris.

128
00:11:26.758 --> 00:11:28.069
Ralph.

129
00:11:28.198 --> 00:11:30.054
I got a whole lot
of presents under the tree.

130
00:11:30.182 --> 00:11:32.069
You could come over later
and unwrap a couple early.

131
00:11:32.198 --> 00:11:35.014
- Hmm. I might be...
- Hold that thought.

132
00:11:35.814 --> 00:11:38.469
Sorry about that. Chris.
What can I get ya?

133
00:11:38.598 --> 00:11:39.718
Johnny Carson.

134
00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:42.534
Not in your usual
chipper mood today.

135
00:11:42.662 --> 00:11:46.278
Went a whole two seconds and I haven't
heard anything about the decline of society

136
00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:48.006
or the reckless youth
in America.

137
00:11:48.133 --> 00:11:49.957
I guess I'm just having
a good day.

138
00:11:51.365 --> 00:11:55.078
Wishin' and waitin' isn't
gonna change what's inside.

139
00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:58.502
Gotta get another whiskey
from the back.

140
00:12:16.038 --> 00:12:17.381
Can I help you?

141
00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:19.109
How are ya. Mike?

142
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:22.342
Don't think I know you.

143
00:12:22.471 --> 00:12:25.126
Nicole and the kids are well.
I hope.

144
00:12:31.814 --> 00:12:34.373
Look. uh. I wasn't gonna
do anything...

145
00:12:34.502 --> 00:12:37.926
Oh. I've known Sandy since she was a kid.
She's a great girl.

146
00:12:38.053 --> 00:12:40.294
But she never did hold
much faith in wedding vows.

147
00:12:40.421 --> 00:12:42.757
- Not like you and me. Mike.
- Listen. I'm...

148
00:12:42.886 --> 00:12:44.165
I'm just here having a drink.
I'm not...

149
00:12:44.295 --> 00:12:46.278
You know. if you drive
straight through...

150
00:12:47.045 --> 00:12:50.278
I reckon you could be home
in 12 hours.

151
00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:52.102
spend the holiday
with your family.

152
00:12:52.231 --> 00:12:53.573
Who are you?

153
00:12:53.702 --> 00:12:57.445
Well. I'm... I'm the guy
that's gonna buy you a beer.

154
00:12:58.342 --> 00:13:00.485
Why don't you hop?
I'll take care of it.

155
00:13:03.942 --> 00:13:06.949
And Mike. drive safe.

156
00:13:17.895 --> 00:13:18.886
Where's Mike?

157
00:13:19.878 --> 00:13:21.735
- Who?
- The good-looking guy

158
00:13:21.862 --> 00:13:24.069
that was sitting right next
to where your fat butt is.

159
00:13:24.198 --> 00:13:27.302
Oh. that fella.
Well. I guess he left.

160
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:32.262
Why is it every time you come in
here. I end up going home alone?

161
00:13:32.773 --> 00:13:34.597
Maybe I'm a jinx.

162
00:13:35.878 --> 00:13:36.838
Yeah.

163
00:14:06.277 --> 00:14:09.702
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello. ma'am. I'm a reporter with <i>The Times.</i>

164
00:14:09.831 --> 00:14:12.518
<i>Oh. that's a wonderful paper.</i>

165
00:14:12.646 --> 00:14:13.957
Yes. it is.

166
00:14:14.086 --> 00:14:16.165
I feel very privileged
to be a part of it.

167
00:14:16.294 --> 00:14:18.853
- <i>How can I help you?</i>
- Yesterday. we ran an article

168
00:14:18.982 --> 00:14:20.773
on your school's
science fair...

169
00:14:21.606 --> 00:14:23.014
and I had a few
follow-up questions

170
00:14:23.142 --> 00:14:25.765
for the "Best of Show."
Christine Crawford.

171
00:14:25.894 --> 00:14:28.357
I was hoping I could get
her contact information.

172
00:14:28.486 --> 00:14:30.373
<i>No problem
I can get that for you.</i>

173
00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:32.582
Fantastic.

174
00:14:36.485 --> 00:14:38.566
<i>Just gonna be
one more second.</i>

175
00:14:39.302 --> 00:14:40.390
Great.

176
00:14:45.415 --> 00:14:47.974
I brought your milk.

177
00:14:48.102 --> 00:14:49.894
Oh. thank you. honey.

178
00:14:50.022 --> 00:14:51.462
Put it here.

179
00:14:52.326 --> 00:14:54.759
You should be resting.

180
00:14:54.886 --> 00:14:57.702
Let's get these outta your way.

181
00:14:58.918 --> 00:15:00.454
On the desk.

182
00:15:11.398 --> 00:15:12.709
Mm.

183
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.589
- Night.
- Good night.

184
00:15:15.718 --> 00:15:18.598
- I love you.
- I love you too.

185
00:15:22.502 --> 00:15:25.189
- Regina!
- Yes. Mr. Wenan.

186
00:15:25.318 --> 00:15:27.462
Grandmother wants everyone
out of the house right now.

187
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:28.837
Certainly. sir.

188
00:16:33.606 --> 00:16:35.559
Mmm. you know...

189
00:16:36.486 --> 00:16:39.077
I've never lost
a science competition.

190
00:16:45.318 --> 00:16:48.453
Did you know a circuit
is only as good as its ground?

191
00:16:50.182 --> 00:16:52.870
Billy. I-I thought that your science proj...

192
00:16:52.998 --> 00:16:56.583
Twelve-volt car battery.

193
00:16:57.031 --> 00:16:59.013
Might not kill you.

194
00:16:59.141 --> 00:17:01.157
but it'll make
your teeth chatter.

195
00:17:01.285 --> 00:17:03.173
You're gonna return
the first-place ribbon

196
00:17:03.303 --> 00:17:07.239
and tell them you were unfairly
helped with that train project.

197
00:17:08.422 --> 00:17:09.541
You cheated.

198
00:17:13.606 --> 00:17:16.389
You don't deserve to win.

199
00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:19.205
Am I being clear?

200
00:17:26.149 --> 00:17:27.494
Get her outta here.

201
00:17:44.038 --> 00:17:45.543
Ah.

202
00:17:46.918 --> 00:17:48.742
They arrived about
20 minutes ago.

203
00:17:48.871 --> 00:17:52.454
Yeah. Hope they brought
the other half of our check.

204
00:17:52.582 --> 00:17:55.366
Stay calm. You exploding
is not gonna help anything.

205
00:17:55.495 --> 00:17:58.918
No. but it'll make me feel better.

206
00:18:00.453 --> 00:18:01.702
Oh.

207
00:18:02.501 --> 00:18:03.718
Good to see you.
Chris.

208
00:18:03.846 --> 00:18:05.990
Apologies about springing
this visit on you.

209
00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:07.558
Why don't we drop
the pleasantries?

210
00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:09.606
It's my busiest time of year.
and I got work to do.

211
00:18:09.734 --> 00:18:12.390
- Now. where's the rest of my money?
- I'm Captain Jacobs.

212
00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:15.813
- We've got a proposition for you.
- No propositions. no shakes.

213
00:18:15.941 --> 00:18:18.022
I want what's due.
And this? This is half.

214
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.862
Well. you only produced
half of last year's product.

215
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.413
and. uh. the subsidy payment
reflects that.

216
00:18:25.541 --> 00:18:29.030
Well. this is Christmas. We're not
handing out participation trophies.

217
00:18:29.158 --> 00:18:32.454
I can't help it if half the kids
deserve coal instead of presents.

218
00:18:32.583 --> 00:18:34.790
We got a minimum budget.
It's in our contract.

219
00:18:34.918 --> 00:18:38.758
Well. actually. your contract with the
United States government. um. states.

220
00:18:38.885 --> 00:18:42.821
"Subsidy payment is dependent on
volume of presents made and delivered."

221
00:18:42.949 --> 00:18:44.869
And that's exactly
how you've been paid.

222
00:18:44.998 --> 00:18:47.943
This won't even
cover the power.

223
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:51.238
We have employees to pay.
food to buy.

224
00:18:51.365 --> 00:18:53.638
and quite frankly.
this is one...

225
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.878
humdinger of a time

226
00:18:56.006 --> 00:18:57.606
to lay this burden on us.

227
00:18:57.734 --> 00:19:00.870
The point is.
with only half our payment.

228
00:19:00.997 --> 00:19:02.758
we're not gonna
be able to survive.

229
00:19:02.885 --> 00:19:06.054
We understand the financial
constraints that you're suffering.

230
00:19:06.183 --> 00:19:08.837
No one wants to shut you down.
not if we don't have to.

231
00:19:08.966 --> 00:19:11.557
Do you even understand
what you're saying?

232
00:19:11.686 --> 00:19:13.255
What you'd be doing
to Christmas?

233
00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:16.166
We want your holiday spirit.
It generates holiday spending.

234
00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:18.150
Let's not get into
all that right now.

235
00:19:18.277 --> 00:19:19.975
I mean.
the important thing is.

236
00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:22.503
we might have a chance
to work this out.

237
00:19:23.815 --> 00:19:25.989
Captain. if you please.

238
00:19:26.502 --> 00:19:28.454
Chris. Ruth.

239
00:19:28.582 --> 00:19:31.813
the United States military would
like to procure your services.

240
00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:42.245
You know what happens
if I hear you talked. right?

241
00:19:42.918 --> 00:19:44.293
No.

242
00:19:44.422 --> 00:19:45.990
I'll kill your mommy.

243
00:19:46.117 --> 00:19:48.230
I'll kill your daddy.

244
00:19:48.838 --> 00:19:50.214
You got a dog?

245
00:19:50.758 --> 00:19:51.973
Yeah.

246
00:19:52.102 --> 00:19:54.183
What's your dog's name?

247
00:19:54.918 --> 00:19:56.934
J-Jo Jo Beans.

248
00:19:57.063 --> 00:20:00.070
Well. I will kill
ol' Jo Jo Beans too.

249
00:20:02.278 --> 00:20:04.518
Now
you're gonna go in there

250
00:20:04.646 --> 00:20:06.405
and say that you were
at the mall

251
00:20:06.534 --> 00:20:08.583
and you lost track
of time.

252
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.077
You were buying them some
Christmas presents. You got it?

253
00:20:11.206 --> 00:20:12.838
I don't have
any Christmas pre...

254
00:20:12.965 --> 00:20:16.294
Well. maybe you were thinking about
buying them some Christmas presents.

255
00:20:20.902 --> 00:20:23.750
Remember.
two nights from now.

256
00:20:23.878 --> 00:20:26.854
Santa's gonna slide his
fat ass down your chimney

257
00:20:26.982 --> 00:20:28.550
and give you
a whole bunch of presents

258
00:20:28.678 --> 00:20:30.822
'cause you've been such
a good girl this year.

259
00:20:31.686 --> 00:20:34.149
You know. he doesn't
do that for everyone.

260
00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:38.310
Here's your phone.

261
00:20:47.942 --> 00:20:49.381
Christine.

262
00:20:52.806 --> 00:20:54.502
Merry Christmas.

263
00:21:06.982 --> 00:21:08.581
Thanks. love.

264
00:21:11.814 --> 00:21:14.758
You think they're serious about
shutting down the factory?

265
00:21:15.494 --> 00:21:17.317
Nah. they're just
trying to bully us

266
00:21:17.446 --> 00:21:19.173
into a contract.

267
00:21:19.302 --> 00:21:21.414
You sure about that?

268
00:21:23.142 --> 00:21:24.806
We could use
the extra income.

269
00:21:24.933 --> 00:21:26.694
Oh. I'm aware.

270
00:21:26.821 --> 00:21:29.062
Doesn't have
to come from them though.

271
00:21:31.046 --> 00:21:32.390
No.

272
00:21:32.518 --> 00:21:34.790
Why. no. it doesn't.

273
00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:37.830
I'm glad I thought of it.

274
00:21:39.942 --> 00:21:41.446
Hmm.

275
00:21:41.574 --> 00:21:44.294
Well. I'm calling you on
Christmas Eve. so you know it's serious.

276
00:21:44.422 --> 00:21:47.430
I mean. I thought we did
a great job for you back in '98.

277
00:21:47.558 --> 00:21:48.870
My team is fast.

278
00:21:48.997 --> 00:21:51.494
And you know
they do quality work. right?

279
00:21:53.765 --> 00:21:55.430
Well. no.

280
00:21:55.558 --> 00:21:57.702
No. no. I can't beat that.

281
00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:01.062
But if you're getting it that cheap. you've
gotta be sacrificing something somewhere.

282
00:22:05.317 --> 00:22:07.558
I'm sorry to hear that.
Lee Ning.

283
00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:11.494
Yes. have a good day. Bye.

284
00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:14.406
Lee Ning. out.

285
00:22:26.086 --> 00:22:29.478
Elon. this is Chris.
What do you got for me?

286
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.814
I bid on everything from
mainframes to Pez dispensers.

287
00:22:35.941 --> 00:22:37.893
Everybody's outsourcing.

288
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:44.422
They got six-year-olds pulling
12-hour shifts in bare feet

289
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.182
for two sticks
of bubble gum.

290
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.070
It's heartbreaking.

291
00:22:48.197 --> 00:22:51.429
You're exhausted. and you've got
a long night of delivering gifts.

292
00:22:51.558 --> 00:22:53.702
Why don't you get some rest
before you go out?

293
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.101
You still got
a little bit of time.

294
00:22:56.229 --> 00:22:58.246
I can't sleep.

295
00:22:58.374 --> 00:23:00.966
The whole damn operation
is goin' tits up.

296
00:23:05.254 --> 00:23:07.590
- Chris.
- <i>Chris. the sleigh's packed and ready to go.</i>

297
00:23:07.718 --> 00:23:09.158
I'll be right there.

298
00:23:10.854 --> 00:23:13.638
- Let me see it.
- Hold on. I'm almost finished.

299
00:23:13.765 --> 00:23:15.526
Let me...
Just give me the list.

300
00:23:15.654 --> 00:23:17.349
Have you checked it?

301
00:23:17.478 --> 00:23:19.269
Come on. It's fine.

302
00:23:26.054 --> 00:23:27.974
Why are you being
like this?

303
00:23:30.661 --> 00:23:32.230
'Cause I failed.

304
00:23:41.318 --> 00:23:42.406
Hey!

305
00:23:42.534 --> 00:23:45.030
- You forgetting something?
- Oh.

306
00:23:49.382 --> 00:23:52.006
- I'll keep hold of this for you.
- Oh. come on.

307
00:23:52.134 --> 00:23:54.278
It's 15 below out here.

308
00:23:54.406 --> 00:23:56.166
Then have hot chocolate.

309
00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.101
All right.

310
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.710
How'd it go?

311
00:26:12.838 --> 00:26:15.142
- I survived.
- Mmm.

312
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:19.334
Merry Christmas. darling.

313
00:27:14.117 --> 00:27:18.502
You just messed
up big time. fat man!

314
00:27:18.629 --> 00:27:19.685
Go!

315
00:27:42.502 --> 00:27:45.382
Hot damn. That was
a course record.

316
00:27:46.053 --> 00:27:47.462
Let's run it again.

317
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.695
I was. uh. hoping to. uh.
get to my son's place

318
00:27:50.822 --> 00:27:53.829
and see the grandkids opening
presents this morning.

319
00:27:57.221 --> 00:28:00.517
Are you not being
compensated for your time?

320
00:28:00.646 --> 00:28:03.271
Oh. y-yeah. yeah. Sure.

321
00:28:03.397 --> 00:28:05.127
Well. is that
not enough for you?

322
00:28:05.253 --> 00:28:06.790
No. uh. it is.

323
00:28:06.918 --> 00:28:08.614
Good.

324
00:28:08.741 --> 00:28:10.309
Then let's run it again.

325
00:28:32.007 --> 00:28:33.157
Is there a problem?

326
00:28:33.286 --> 00:28:34.918
<i>I've got a job for you.</i>

327
00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:36.966
- Good.
- <i>I think you're gonna like it.</i>

328
00:28:37.093 --> 00:28:39.269
<i>It complements
that hobby of yours.</i>

329
00:28:39.398 --> 00:28:40.742
What's the job?

330
00:28:44.069 --> 00:28:46.502
I'd like you
to kill Santa Claus.

331
00:28:49.287 --> 00:28:51.111
Really?

332
00:28:51.238 --> 00:28:53.573
<i>I know he let you down too.</i>

333
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:55.685
Well. uh...

334
00:28:56.358 --> 00:28:57.798
that's not gonna be easy.

335
00:28:57.927 --> 00:29:00.902
<i>Well. if you're not interested.
I'm sure I could find s...</i>

336
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:02.662
No. I'm interested.

337
00:29:03.173 --> 00:29:05.189
I'm very interested.

338
00:29:14.502 --> 00:29:15.782
<i>Hello. Davis here.</i>

339
00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.830
Ah. good morning.
This is Chris.

340
00:29:17.958 --> 00:29:20.133
- <i>Chris. good morning.</i>
- I'll do the contract.

341
00:29:20.262 --> 00:29:21.766
<i>Oh. that's fantastic!
That's great.</i>

342
00:29:21.895 --> 00:29:25.222
- Ye... Yeah. Yeah. well. yes.
- <i>Let's get together...</i>

343
00:29:25.349 --> 00:29:27.622
Well. m-merry... merry Christmas.

344
00:29:27.751 --> 00:29:31.302
The one day you get to sleep
in. and you're up early.

345
00:29:31.431 --> 00:29:33.255
Well. I had
a heavy mind.

346
00:29:35.749 --> 00:29:37.925
I just agreed
to the contract.

347
00:29:38.055 --> 00:29:40.709
- It's what we have to do. love.
- I know.

348
00:29:41.478 --> 00:29:42.918
What is it?

349
00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:46.021
Oh. some kids with a deer
rifle put some flak in the air.

350
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:47.815
- Again?
- Yeah.

351
00:29:47.941 --> 00:29:51.430
Put two holes in the sleigh. one in me.
Even tore my bag.

352
00:29:51.558 --> 00:29:54.022
Don't worry about the bag.
Let me see your side.

353
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:56.262
I'm all right. It's...
It's fine. it's fine.

354
00:29:56.391 --> 00:29:58.278
It'll heal
in the usual way.

355
00:30:00.805 --> 00:30:02.885
I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

356
00:30:04.326 --> 00:30:06.855
Maybe it's time
I retired the coat.

357
00:30:06.982 --> 00:30:10.021
You just need a break.
We're all feeling it this year.

358
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:11.846
I've lost
my influence.

359
00:30:11.973 --> 00:30:14.758
You're an icon.
People love you.

360
00:30:14.886 --> 00:30:16.966
I'm a silly. fat man
in a red suit.

361
00:30:17.093 --> 00:30:20.613
I mean. you think it's cute. but this
is what people actually think of me.

362
00:30:20.742 --> 00:30:22.853
Christmas is a farce.
I am a joke.

363
00:30:22.982 --> 00:30:25.413
There hasn't been any real
spirit of the season anymore.

364
00:30:25.542 --> 00:30:26.789
Not for years.

365
00:30:26.919 --> 00:30:28.709
Let's just get
a few days out on this.

366
00:30:28.839 --> 00:30:30.437
That will give you
a better perspective.

367
00:30:30.565 --> 00:30:32.326
I should've charged them
royalties for my image.

368
00:30:32.453 --> 00:30:34.502
- Now. that's what we should've done.
- That's not who we are.

369
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:38.309
No. we're only the largest economic
stimulus in the entire world.

370
00:30:38.439 --> 00:30:40.902
Christmas generates
$3 trillion in the US alone.

371
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:43.270
We can't pay our power bill.
Think there's something wrong with that?

372
00:30:43.398 --> 00:30:45.702
Oh. is that how
we're measuring success now?

373
00:30:45.829 --> 00:30:47.493
Well. that's what
they care about.

374
00:30:47.622 --> 00:30:52.709
They put up with us so they can
sell their toys and sodas and cars.

375
00:30:52.839 --> 00:30:53.895
We're a business.

376
00:30:54.022 --> 00:30:56.133
And don't kid yourself. Ruth.

377
00:30:56.262 --> 00:30:59.173
Altruism is not a deductible
on their bottom line.

378
00:30:59.302 --> 00:31:02.117
Don't put it all on them.
You've changed too.

379
00:31:03.526 --> 00:31:05.029
You might be right.

380
00:31:06.053 --> 00:31:08.005
Maybe I'm just like 'em.

381
00:31:09.126 --> 00:31:10.853
You still have it.

382
00:31:12.869 --> 00:31:17.830
All I have is a loathing
for a world that's forgotten.

383
00:31:25.575 --> 00:31:27.462
Thanks for the cigars.

384
00:31:54.085 --> 00:31:56.358
- <i>Information. Can I help you?</i>
- Yeah. yeah. yeah.

385
00:31:56.486 --> 00:31:58.375
I need to get ahold of somebody
in the North Pole.

386
00:31:58.501 --> 00:32:01.863
<i>I'm not able to search without
a specific country or code.</i>

387
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:06.341
Okay. All right. uh. then what's
the closest thing to the North Pole?

388
00:32:06.469 --> 00:32:08.389
Something... Something
arctic. in the Arctic Circle.

389
00:32:08.518 --> 00:32:11.590
<i>Unfortunately. I don't know. If you
could be more specific. I could help you.</i>

390
00:32:11.718 --> 00:32:15.109
Well. is there a city up there.
an island. anything?

391
00:32:15.238 --> 00:32:17.446
A chunk of ice
floating in the fucking ocean?

392
00:32:17.575 --> 00:32:19.430
<i>I can't stay on if you're
gonna talk like that.</i>

393
00:32:19.558 --> 00:32:21.222
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cuss.

394
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.749
- Please don't hang up.
- <i>I want to help you. If you could be more specific.</i>

395
00:32:23.878 --> 00:32:26.406
Okay. uh.
what about the city of...

396
00:32:26.533 --> 00:32:28.710
of Eureka
on Ellesmere Island?

397
00:32:28.839 --> 00:32:31.782
- <i>Okay. I have it.</i>
- Great. great.

398
00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:34.630
Do you have a listing
for Christopher Cringle?

399
00:32:34.758 --> 00:32:36.901
Hello?

400
00:32:37.766 --> 00:32:39.909
Hello?

401
00:32:40.037 --> 00:32:42.438
Why did you
hang up the fucking phone?

402
00:32:51.333 --> 00:32:52.935
Just relax.

403
00:33:01.638 --> 00:33:02.695
Back to basics.

404
00:33:10.246 --> 00:33:12.295
- Damn! Shit.
- I broke it.

405
00:33:12.421 --> 00:33:13.318
- I broke it.
- Jesus.

406
00:33:32.455 --> 00:33:34.501
May I get another pot of tea?

407
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.454
Mr. Wenan.
This package came for you.

408
00:33:52.582 --> 00:33:54.949
From your father
for Christmas.

409
00:33:59.557 --> 00:34:00.999
It's a few days late.

410
00:34:01.126 --> 00:34:02.341
Yes. sir.

411
00:34:03.589 --> 00:34:05.095
From the Bahamas?

412
00:34:05.221 --> 00:34:07.269
That's what it says.
sir.

413
00:34:07.397 --> 00:34:10.149
He's probably there with
his girlfriend. Kara.

414
00:34:11.013 --> 00:34:12.486
I wouldn't know. sir.

415
00:34:13.925 --> 00:34:16.422
Well. pass it to me.

416
00:35:40.293 --> 00:35:42.438
Where the hell are you?

417
00:36:22.533 --> 00:36:23.718
Hey.

418
00:36:24.358 --> 00:36:25.638
Where do the. uh...

419
00:36:25.766 --> 00:36:28.070
the letters
to Santa go?

420
00:36:28.198 --> 00:36:30.213
You know. the letters the
children write to Santa Claus?

421
00:36:30.341 --> 00:36:31.814
- What happens to 'em?
- Yeah. yeah. H-36.

422
00:36:31.942 --> 00:36:34.534
Uh. it's a... it's a bin
down at the office.

423
00:36:34.662 --> 00:36:37.893
- Right. What happens to 'em after that?
- Uh. I don't know.

424
00:36:38.021 --> 00:36:39.877
Guess you could ask Weyland.
our district super.

425
00:36:40.006 --> 00:36:41.254
Weyland? You know
where I could find him?

426
00:36:41.382 --> 00:36:43.366
Yeah. downtown office.
just off Redding Street.

427
00:36:43.494 --> 00:36:44.613
- Redding?
- Yeah.

428
00:36:44.741 --> 00:36:47.270
- Great. Thank you.
- No problem.

429
00:36:47.398 --> 00:36:48.806
Have a good day.

430
00:37:01.925 --> 00:37:03.206
Morning.

431
00:37:03.813 --> 00:37:06.246
Sorry.
This is my first day.

432
00:37:06.374 --> 00:37:08.677
Know where I can find
Supervisor Meeks's office?

433
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:19.590
Um...

434
00:37:20.038 --> 00:37:21.702
can I help you?

435
00:37:22.886 --> 00:37:25.318
I'm looking
for the fat man.

436
00:37:25.446 --> 00:37:26.374
Where is he?

437
00:37:26.502 --> 00:37:27.942
Excuse me?

438
00:37:28.678 --> 00:37:30.918
Santa Claus.
motherfucker.

439
00:37:32.774 --> 00:37:34.629
Come on. Weyland.

440
00:37:34.758 --> 00:37:36.326
Don't act stupid.

441
00:37:36.453 --> 00:37:40.261
Just give me the address and
I'll walk right out of here.

442
00:37:43.558 --> 00:37:45.318
Where do you send the letters?

443
00:37:45.446 --> 00:37:47.366
Okay. just take it easy.

444
00:37:50.182 --> 00:37:52.550
Look.
I can't give you an address because...

445
00:37:52.678 --> 00:37:54.246
Shh.

446
00:37:54.374 --> 00:37:56.645
I can't give you an
address because I don't have one.

447
00:37:56.774 --> 00:37:58.438
Then you just sorted
your last piece of mail.

448
00:37:58.565 --> 00:38:00.166
No. no. no. no.
I just...

449
00:38:00.294 --> 00:38:03.718
Look. it's a classified program.
They give me a PO box and that's it.

450
00:38:03.846 --> 00:38:05.414
I don't know anything else.
I swear to you.

451
00:38:05.542 --> 00:38:08.229
We just crate up the letters
and send them out.

452
00:38:10.502 --> 00:38:11.686
Write it down.

453
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.502
- Write it down.
- Okay.

454
00:38:14.917 --> 00:38:16.294
Okay.

455
00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:18.950
To the right.

456
00:38:19.078 --> 00:38:20.166
Other way.

457
00:38:26.694 --> 00:38:28.806
Not that page.
Use a blank one.

458
00:38:31.877 --> 00:38:33.350
Okay.

459
00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:35.430
- Slow down. Make it legible.
- Fuck.

460
00:38:37.318 --> 00:38:38.470
Okay?

461
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.582
- You gotta be shitting me.
- No. no. no. It's the truth. I swear it.

462
00:38:54.406 --> 00:38:57.510
So. uh. what now?

463
00:38:59.782 --> 00:39:01.126
Well...

464
00:39:01.989 --> 00:39:03.398
that's it.

465
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.157
Son of a...

466
00:39:48.742 --> 00:39:50.278
<i>Hello?</i>

467
00:39:50.406 --> 00:39:51.942
We're a go.

468
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.726
- I'll be on the road by midnight.
- <i>Sounds good.</i>

469
00:39:54.854 --> 00:39:56.806
<i>Keep me updated
on your progress.</i>

470
00:41:08.198 --> 00:41:10.054
They'll understand.

471
00:41:11.749 --> 00:41:13.542
They shouldn't have to.

472
00:41:14.758 --> 00:41:17.191
Can I assume
they speak English?

473
00:41:17.318 --> 00:41:22.342
Our work requires that they
speak many different languages.

474
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:24.998
Let's just get this
over with.

475
00:41:34.982 --> 00:41:38.822
All right. everyone.
Quiet down now. Let's quiet down.

476
00:41:44.678 --> 00:41:48.966
- Is everybody here?
- We're all here and accounted for. sir.

477
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:53.638
Well. firstly. uh.

478
00:41:53.766 --> 00:41:56.902
I'm sorry to call you
all back so early.

479
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.845
But I'm sure you're all
excited to get cracking

480
00:41:59.974 --> 00:42:03.718
and get working again
on next year's Christmas season.

481
00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:16.358
And you're probably wondering about
all the new faces around here today.

482
00:42:18.118 --> 00:42:19.974
Well.
as you already know...

483
00:42:21.894 --> 00:42:26.278
there is a rising number of our
youth making poor decisions.

484
00:42:28.006 --> 00:42:32.422
Now. this has unfortunately
caused our yearly subsidy

485
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.142
to be well below
our current budget.

486
00:42:36.871 --> 00:42:39.205
Now. to make up
for that shortfall...

487
00:42:41.862 --> 00:42:46.022
we are fulfilling a two-month
contract with the US military.

488
00:42:54.182 --> 00:42:58.502
Now. I know this must come
as a shock to a lot of you.

489
00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.926
Believe me.
had there been any other way...

490
00:43:06.278 --> 00:43:08.326
This is Captain Jacobs.

491
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:10.662
Captain Jacobs'll fill you in

492
00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:13.413
on a lot of the changes
that are going on around here.

493
00:43:13.542 --> 00:43:14.918
Thank you.

494
00:43:19.206 --> 00:43:22.086
I am going to go over
some rules

495
00:43:22.213 --> 00:43:24.358
that must be followed
without exception

496
00:43:24.485 --> 00:43:26.662
and throughout the duration
of this engagement.

497
00:43:26.791 --> 00:43:31.174
These rules are for your safety.
and your safety alone.

498
00:43:31.301 --> 00:43:34.246
Number one.
you will be fingerprinted.

499
00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:38.054
- assigned a security badge to be worn at all times.
- Next.

500
00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:41.669
Number two. you must enter
and exit the factory floor

501
00:43:41.798 --> 00:43:43.718
through the
southern bay doors only.

502
00:43:43.846 --> 00:43:48.006
Number three. you must remove
the bells from your uniforms

503
00:43:48.133 --> 00:43:50.695
as they will set off
our metal detectors.

504
00:43:50.822 --> 00:43:55.109
In addition to these rules.
we will be upgrading the site's security.

505
00:43:55.782 --> 00:43:57.573
Do you have any questions?

506
00:43:58.918 --> 00:43:59.974
Yes.

507
00:44:00.101 --> 00:44:02.311
What kind of toys
are we making. sir?

508
00:44:02.437 --> 00:44:03.782
Not toys. miss.

509
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.982
Control panels for
America's eagle in the sky.

510
00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:09.734
our FJ-63 fighter jets.

511
00:44:17.926 --> 00:44:19.813
What's the purpose
of your visit?

512
00:44:20.455 --> 00:44:23.206
Recreation. Hunting.

513
00:44:23.335 --> 00:44:25.382
I'm gonna kill some things.

514
00:44:27.622 --> 00:44:29.509
You fill out the 5589?

515
00:44:29.638 --> 00:44:33.413
Yes. ma'am.
I have my 5589...

516
00:44:33.862 --> 00:44:36.902
my 4457.

517
00:44:37.029 --> 00:44:39.782
and my 3177 right here.

518
00:44:58.213 --> 00:44:59.462
All right.

519
00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:00.966
Welcome to Canada.

520
00:45:01.414 --> 00:45:02.853
Good to be here.

521
00:45:44.935 --> 00:45:47.815
Holy Christ. Corporal.
you call that hammering?

522
00:45:48.485 --> 00:45:50.727
Show a little pride
in your work.

523
00:45:50.853 --> 00:45:52.102
Here. You're up.

524
00:45:54.245 --> 00:45:55.909
Holy hell.

525
00:45:56.038 --> 00:45:58.406
Soldier. get your sorry ass
out of that lift.

526
00:45:58.533 --> 00:46:00.135
Clean that shit up.

527
00:46:13.798 --> 00:46:15.269
Hey. partner. Here.

528
00:46:15.398 --> 00:46:16.837
Hang on to this.

529
00:46:30.886 --> 00:46:32.229
Thank you.

530
00:46:32.902 --> 00:46:34.246
Steroids.

531
00:46:40.741 --> 00:46:43.045
I come in peace.

532
00:46:43.174 --> 00:46:44.806
Thank you.

533
00:46:59.655 --> 00:47:01.575
Morning. 7.
How's everybody holding up?

534
00:47:01.702 --> 00:47:04.966
Very well. sir. We got the
line up and running last night.

535
00:47:05.093 --> 00:47:07.621
- Right now we're optimizing.
- Oh. yeah.

536
00:47:07.749 --> 00:47:09.925
Okay. optimizing.
I see.

537
00:47:10.053 --> 00:47:11.845
19. 23.
how are you doing?

538
00:47:11.973 --> 00:47:14.151
- Wonderfully perfect. sir.
- Uh. super-duper good.

539
00:47:14.278 --> 00:47:16.870
Ah. I appreciate
the positivity.

540
00:47:16.998 --> 00:47:17.926
Are you buying that?

541
00:47:18.055 --> 00:47:19.815
Absolutely. boss.

542
00:47:19.942 --> 00:47:23.013
I really backed you into a corner on this
one. 7. Don't think I don't know that.

543
00:47:23.142 --> 00:47:25.861
The order calls for a lot of
product in a short amount of time.

544
00:47:25.989 --> 00:47:29.701
Yeah. it's gonna be a squeaker even if
everything goes perfect. Refill. thanks.

545
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:31.013
Which it never does.

546
00:47:31.142 --> 00:47:32.837
When have you seen it
go perfect?

547
00:47:32.965 --> 00:47:35.398
- 1910 was close.
- There was a bad war that year.

548
00:47:35.526 --> 00:47:36.549
You can't blame
yourself.

549
00:47:36.677 --> 00:47:39.175
- I'll go check the crew.
- The office.

550
00:47:39.301 --> 00:47:40.678
Oh. one more thing.

551
00:47:40.806 --> 00:47:42.373
7...

552
00:47:42.502 --> 00:47:45.189
this is make or break
for us.

553
00:47:45.317 --> 00:47:48.646
I don't need to tell you that
absolutely everything is on the line.

554
00:47:49.638 --> 00:47:52.294
Christmas is at stake. sir.
We won't let you down.

555
00:47:52.422 --> 00:47:55.558
- We'll have the order finished on time.
- Good man.

556
00:47:55.686 --> 00:47:58.119
Chris. I just
talked to my superiors.

557
00:47:58.246 --> 00:48:00.326
They're very impressed with
the numbers that I gave them.

558
00:48:00.453 --> 00:48:03.685
They're sending in a couple of suits
to have a look at the operation.

559
00:48:03.814 --> 00:48:05.862
It's a very impressive
group of...

560
00:48:06.726 --> 00:48:08.646
little workers
you've got here.

561
00:48:08.775 --> 00:48:09.735
Real hard workers.

562
00:48:10.951 --> 00:48:13.126
I'd like to use the break
room. if that's possible.

563
00:48:13.253 --> 00:48:15.686
I'm running an eight-man
rotation. four on at all times.

564
00:48:15.813 --> 00:48:18.821
Me or one of my men are gonna be
inside the factory 24 hours a day.

565
00:48:18.949 --> 00:48:20.837
How does that
sit with you. 7?

566
00:48:20.965 --> 00:48:23.686
We can take our breaks
in the cafeteria.

567
00:48:23.813 --> 00:48:25.990
Many thanks to you.
Captain Jacobs.

568
00:48:26.118 --> 00:48:27.589
- 7.
- 7?

569
00:48:27.718 --> 00:48:29.638
We're all ranked and
accounted for by number.

570
00:48:29.766 --> 00:48:31.015
It's more efficient
that way.

571
00:48:31.141 --> 00:48:32.966
7's our factory foreman.

572
00:48:33.093 --> 00:48:34.213
What happened to
1 through 6?

573
00:48:34.342 --> 00:48:36.229
Well. we've been at this
a long time.

574
00:48:36.358 --> 00:48:38.278
We don't reissue numbers.

575
00:48:38.406 --> 00:48:41.223
That would be unethical
and dishonorable.

576
00:48:42.214 --> 00:48:43.110
I like it.

577
00:48:43.239 --> 00:48:44.997
That's a hell of
a way to run a crew.

578
00:48:45.126 --> 00:48:48.613
Would you like a cookie.
Captain Jacobs?

579
00:48:49.222 --> 00:48:50.501
Indeed.

580
00:48:51.717 --> 00:48:53.253
A hell of a way
to run a crew.

581
00:48:53.381 --> 00:48:54.663
Excuse me.

582
00:48:59.622 --> 00:49:00.678
Mmm.

583
00:49:01.861 --> 00:49:03.109
Wow.

584
00:49:15.333 --> 00:49:16.902
You all right. buddy?

585
00:49:30.693 --> 00:49:33.797
The hamster hammock is a top
seller and this. the roller.

586
00:49:33.926 --> 00:49:36.453
Then we have
the seesaw.

587
00:49:36.581 --> 00:49:39.271
Nibblers and
the pet playhouse.

588
00:49:39.397 --> 00:49:41.542
There's no room
for the pet playhouse.

589
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:44.422
You know. it's funny.
You don't strike me as a hamster person.

590
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:47.686
- Well. I am.
- You seem more like a... a reptile person.

591
00:49:47.815 --> 00:49:49.861
Do you like lizards?

592
00:49:51.238 --> 00:49:52.711
I have a great selection
of chameleons.

593
00:49:52.837 --> 00:49:54.821
I don't want a chameleon.

594
00:49:56.358 --> 00:49:57.541
Snakes.

595
00:49:57.669 --> 00:50:00.453
That's it.
You're a snake person.

596
00:50:01.413 --> 00:50:03.110
Snakes eat hamsters.

597
00:50:03.238 --> 00:50:05.477
You know. lots of people don't know
what kind of pet person they are.

598
00:50:05.606 --> 00:50:07.526
but I'm really good
at this.

599
00:50:08.326 --> 00:50:10.630
You know. you remind me
a lot of my mother.

600
00:50:10.758 --> 00:50:12.101
- Really?
- Yeah.

601
00:50:12.229 --> 00:50:13.830
She wasn't
a good listener.

602
00:50:13.957 --> 00:50:16.997
and she never knew
when to shut the fuck up.

603
00:50:19.749 --> 00:50:21.094
Thank you.

604
00:50:38.598 --> 00:50:40.166
Here you go. fellas.

605
00:50:46.726 --> 00:50:47.749
- Hi.
- Hey.

606
00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:49.094
Mr. Cringle.

607
00:50:49.222 --> 00:50:51.397
We had a hell of a time
finding this place.

608
00:50:51.526 --> 00:50:53.477
Asked around town.
but no one had a clue.

609
00:50:53.606 --> 00:50:55.975
Yeah. as you can imagine.
it has to be that way.

610
00:50:56.101 --> 00:50:57.286
And we think
it's a good thing.

611
00:50:57.414 --> 00:50:59.173
Great thing.
Yeah. I'm Lex Taylor.

612
00:50:59.302 --> 00:51:02.086
- This is. uh. Carter Mapplethorpe.
- I know who you are.

613
00:51:02.214 --> 00:51:04.263
Right. They warned us
about that.

614
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:06.693
Things were a little touch-and-go
for a couple of years.

615
00:51:06.821 --> 00:51:08.326
Weren't they. Carter?

616
00:51:10.597 --> 00:51:12.613
Whoa. hey. hey.

617
00:51:12.742 --> 00:51:14.854
Oh. that's Donner.
He gets a mite nippy.

618
00:51:14.982 --> 00:51:17.446
You're lucky it wasn't Blitzer.
She'd tear your package right off.

619
00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:20.101
Well. have a look around. fellas.

620
00:51:20.229 --> 00:51:21.958
7. my shop foreman.

621
00:51:22.085 --> 00:51:23.686
will show you anything
you might need to see.

622
00:51:23.815 --> 00:51:25.925
We. uh. don't need to have
a look around. Chris.

623
00:51:26.053 --> 00:51:28.550
No. we've seen the numbers.
we've seen the samples.

624
00:51:28.678 --> 00:51:30.438
and the work you do
is exceptional.

625
00:51:30.566 --> 00:51:33.733
The military would like to procure
your services on an annual basis.

626
00:51:33.862 --> 00:51:35.878
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves here.

627
00:51:36.006 --> 00:51:40.934
We are prepared to guarantee
your subsidization for 15 years.

628
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.718
I hear
what you're saying.

629
00:51:43.846 --> 00:51:45.670
but this is a one-time deal.
gentlemen.

630
00:51:45.798 --> 00:51:49.190
How about you wait until you get that
check on the first of next month.

631
00:51:49.318 --> 00:51:52.454
and then we'll see if you
don't have a change of heart.

632
00:51:52.582 --> 00:51:53.990
That's not gonna happen.

633
00:51:54.118 --> 00:51:57.030
I appreciate your optimism.
sir. I-I really do.

634
00:51:57.158 --> 00:52:00.038
but with all due respect.
I think both of us know

635
00:52:00.166 --> 00:52:03.558
that there's a very good chance you're
gonna end up right back here next year.

636
00:52:04.261 --> 00:52:05.670
And then maybe.
Mr. Cringle.

637
00:52:05.798 --> 00:52:09.061
- the deal we offer won't be so sweet.
- Mm-hmm.

638
00:52:09.958 --> 00:52:11.302
I'll keep
some axle grease handy

639
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.638
just in case
I change my mind.

640
00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:18.246
Okay.

641
00:52:44.006 --> 00:52:46.054
<i>But will the president do that?</i>

642
00:52:46.182 --> 00:52:48.198
<i>I think he already is.</i>

643
00:52:56.197 --> 00:52:58.149
Sit tight.
Be right back.

644
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:10.597
You get this
for Christmas?

645
00:53:10.726 --> 00:53:12.902
Yeah. Santa gave it to me.

646
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:16.389
You must be a good kid.

647
00:53:17.285 --> 00:53:18.886
I guess so.

648
00:53:19.014 --> 00:53:22.438
You know what I got for
Christmas when I was your age?

649
00:53:25.798 --> 00:53:29.318
You never forget the smell of
burning flesh and menthols.

650
00:53:35.942 --> 00:53:37.926
Give you
a hundred bucks for it.

651
00:53:42.726 --> 00:53:43.750
150.

652
00:54:37.893 --> 00:54:40.038
Your workers sure have
healthy appetites.

653
00:54:41.765 --> 00:54:44.262
You know. I can't help but think
the smallness and discoloration

654
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:47.174
is a direct result of
an inadequate diet.

655
00:54:47.302 --> 00:54:48.646
Inadequate?

656
00:54:49.702 --> 00:54:50.822
Please elaborate.

657
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:52.966
Well. I think
what you need is some...

658
00:54:53.094 --> 00:54:55.910
protein. vegetables. fiber.

659
00:54:56.038 --> 00:54:59.814
I bet if we gave some
real food to these people.

660
00:54:59.941 --> 00:55:01.989
they would shoot up
like bean stalks.

661
00:55:02.118 --> 00:55:05.733
Captain. we have discovered the most
efficient and productive way to eat

662
00:55:05.862 --> 00:55:07.749
is simple carbs
and sugars

663
00:55:07.878 --> 00:55:08.806
six times a day.

664
00:55:08.934 --> 00:55:10.790
But that's unnatural.

665
00:55:10.918 --> 00:55:12.774
The body needs
four food groups.

666
00:55:12.902 --> 00:55:15.526
regular exercise.
a minimum of six hours of sleep.

667
00:55:15.654 --> 00:55:19.622
Oh. every elf takes a 20-minute
nap every eight hours.

668
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:23.622
That keeps our bodies fresh and allows
us to work on a 24-hour rotation.

669
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:25.830
How long can you keep that up?

670
00:55:25.958 --> 00:55:27.174
Indefinitely.

671
00:55:27.302 --> 00:55:29.733
It's why elves live
much longer than humans.

672
00:55:31.942 --> 00:55:34.662
- And Chris? He does the same?
- No.

673
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:37.157
It's the giving
that keeps him young.

674
00:57:26.758 --> 00:57:30.278
Thought I'd head into town
tomorrow to check the PO box.

675
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:34.118
I'm gonna feel a lot better
with that check in my hand.

676
00:57:34.246 --> 00:57:35.910
I'm with you there.

677
00:57:37.318 --> 00:57:39.558
Thanks for these.

678
00:57:40.134 --> 00:57:42.725
We have each other's backs.

679
00:57:42.854 --> 00:57:44.741
That's how this works.

680
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:48.358
Remember when my baking went
through the vegan. sugar-free phase?

681
00:57:48.485 --> 00:57:49.478
Oh. yeah.

682
00:57:50.053 --> 00:57:51.718
I was lucky
to survive it.

683
00:57:51.878 --> 00:57:53.733
Must've lost 12 pounds.

684
00:57:53.862 --> 00:57:57.702
But you told me. even though you knew
I wouldn't be thrilled to hear it.

685
00:57:57.829 --> 00:58:00.486
That may have been more of
a self-preservation thing.

686
00:58:00.613 --> 00:58:05.413
Point is. we both have
good days and bad days.

687
00:58:05.542 --> 00:58:08.678
We disagree.
We tick each other off.

688
00:58:08.806 --> 00:58:12.775
Like when you come into the house
dripping sweat all over the floor.

689
00:58:12.902 --> 00:58:16.390
using my good towels
for sweat rags.

690
00:58:18.726 --> 00:58:20.487
But I love you.

691
00:58:20.613 --> 00:58:22.181
So we figure it out.

692
00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:24.230
we work through it.

693
00:58:24.358 --> 00:58:26.117
we lift each other up.

694
00:58:28.966 --> 00:58:32.198
- I'm feeling downright inspired.
- Good!

695
00:58:32.326 --> 00:58:34.951
Let's hope that inspiration
starts with a shower.

696
00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:36.614
Mm. That... That bad?

697
00:58:36.742 --> 00:58:38.438
Yes.

698
00:58:38.566 --> 00:58:39.526
- Really?
- Hmm.

699
00:58:39.655 --> 00:58:40.998
- No chance?
- Oh. God.

700
00:58:41.125 --> 00:58:42.949
I got to talk you into this?

701
00:58:43.078 --> 00:58:45.606
- How about I... Oh. okay. All right.
- Just... Just go. Go.

702
00:59:07.527 --> 00:59:09.478
Afternoon.

703
00:59:09.606 --> 00:59:11.558
Hope the new year
is treating you well.

704
00:59:11.686 --> 00:59:15.077
Only a couple of days in.
but I'm optimistic.

705
00:59:23.206 --> 00:59:25.541
Can I help you
with anything?

706
00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:27.205
Yeah.

707
00:59:28.006 --> 00:59:29.733
I'm. uh...

708
00:59:30.598 --> 00:59:32.646
looking for
a friend of mine.

709
00:59:33.351 --> 00:59:34.471
This is his box.

710
00:59:34.597 --> 00:59:36.295
What box you lookin' at?

711
00:59:36.422 --> 00:59:37.669
323.

712
00:59:37.798 --> 00:59:39.207
You a friend of Chris's?

713
00:59:39.333 --> 00:59:41.031
Yeah.

714
00:59:41.158 --> 00:59:44.838
Yeah. we. uh. we did some
business a couple of years back.

715
00:59:44.967 --> 00:59:47.302
Wanted to look him up.
but I misplaced his contact information.

716
00:59:47.429 --> 00:59:49.062
I was hoping maybe
you could help me out.

717
00:59:49.189 --> 00:59:52.198
Well. sadly. don't think
I'm gonna be able to.

718
00:59:55.717 --> 00:59:57.190
Really?

719
00:59:58.629 --> 01:00:00.422
Oh. that's. uh...

720
01:00:01.158 --> 01:00:02.598
that's very disappointing.

721
01:00:02.725 --> 01:00:04.231
I've come a long way.

722
01:00:05.222 --> 01:00:09.574
No. can't say he ever gave us
any contact information.

723
01:00:10.502 --> 01:00:12.389
You don't even have
his last name?

724
01:00:12.518 --> 01:00:15.174
Been that way
since I can recall.

725
01:00:17.125 --> 01:00:19.717
- Hey. there. Sandy.
- Hey. Herman.

726
01:00:19.846 --> 01:00:22.022
I gotta get this thing
out to Palm Beach double-time.

727
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:24.517
Hold on a sec
while I help this gentleman.

728
01:00:24.646 --> 01:00:26.437
Let's have you
leave a message.

729
01:00:26.566 --> 01:00:28.102
Chris comes in
every couple of days.

730
01:00:28.231 --> 01:00:29.798
That's all right.

731
01:00:31.781 --> 01:00:35.109
Say. does. uh.
Chris still drive that green Chevy?

732
01:00:35.686 --> 01:00:37.606
- Red Ford.
- Right.

733
01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:39.173
I meant Ford.

734
01:00:50.725 --> 01:00:52.870
I don't like duck canvas.

735
01:00:53.478 --> 01:00:56.166
Way too much going on.

736
01:00:56.293 --> 01:00:59.238
Too many sticks.
I'm not a fucking tree.

737
01:01:00.037 --> 01:01:01.575
Too puffy.

738
01:01:02.118 --> 01:01:04.102
Tan makes me look fat.

739
01:01:04.229 --> 01:01:06.278
Green is fucking stupid.

740
01:01:07.142 --> 01:01:09.286
Maybe you could give me some idea

741
01:01:09.415 --> 01:01:11.557
of what
you're looking for.

742
01:01:14.151 --> 01:01:15.301
What about that one?

743
01:01:15.429 --> 01:01:16.902
Great coat.

744
01:01:17.031 --> 01:01:20.229
I can see you're a man who
appreciates a quality garment.

745
01:01:21.574 --> 01:01:22.469
Hmm.

746
01:02:00.421 --> 01:02:01.990
<i>Yeah.</i>

747
01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:04.102
Status report.

748
01:02:04.231 --> 01:02:06.662
Getting warmer.
so to speak.

749
01:02:07.782 --> 01:02:08.838
<i>I was thinking.</i>

750
01:02:08.966 --> 01:02:12.711
I'm putting a lot
into this venture financially.

751
01:02:12.838 --> 01:02:14.470
and I'd like
to retain a keepsake.

752
01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:16.358
What did you have in mind?

753
01:02:17.926 --> 01:02:19.462
I want the big man's head.

754
01:02:19.591 --> 01:02:22.119
<i>That could be problematic.</i>

755
01:02:22.246 --> 01:02:25.862
- Are you saying no?
- I'm saying that it's not practical.

756
01:02:26.629 --> 01:02:28.038
Severed heads are fickle.

757
01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:30.982
They rot. they mold.
they smell.

758
01:02:31.111 --> 01:02:34.981
It's a multi-day trip across two international
borders and several state lines.

759
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:37.989
which means a sizable cooler.
frequent stops

760
01:02:38.117 --> 01:02:40.711
and putting myself
at considerable risk.

761
01:02:40.837 --> 01:02:42.822
And I don't do that
for anyone.

762
01:02:43.749 --> 01:02:44.965
Then I want his beard.

763
01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:48.198
I'm not shaving off
a dead man's beard.

764
01:02:50.055 --> 01:02:52.935
How about some. uh...
some sleigh bells?

765
01:02:53.062 --> 01:02:54.469
No.

766
01:02:55.141 --> 01:02:56.838
Okay. Uh...

767
01:02:57.862 --> 01:02:59.269
What about his coat?

768
01:03:00.133 --> 01:03:02.631
Fine.
Bring the coat.

769
01:03:02.758 --> 01:03:04.069
Great.

770
01:03:04.198 --> 01:03:06.149
All right. I gotta go
back to work now.

771
01:03:06.279 --> 01:03:08.262
Keep me abreast
of your progress.

772
01:03:10.629 --> 01:03:12.039
You fucking prick.

773
01:03:55.813 --> 01:03:57.829
Hey. Sandy.
How's the day?

774
01:03:57.958 --> 01:03:59.461
What's got you
in such a good mood?

775
01:03:59.589 --> 01:04:01.669
Well. I found
something I lost.

776
01:04:01.798 --> 01:04:05.638
- Hmm.
- Uh. it's too early for all of that.

777
01:04:05.766 --> 01:04:08.166
- Well. then what'll you have?
- I just dropped in to say hello.

778
01:04:08.293 --> 01:04:11.463
And if it's not too much trouble.
maybe a glass of milk for the road.

779
01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:13.735
- Milk.
- Yep.

780
01:04:14.695 --> 01:04:17.766
- Want me to warm it up for you?
- That'd be nice.

781
01:04:31.206 --> 01:04:32.775
Oh. man.

782
01:04:54.533 --> 01:04:56.710
- Hey. Chris.
- Hey. Herman. How you doing?

783
01:04:57.926 --> 01:04:59.622
I'm good.

784
01:05:00.838 --> 01:05:03.142
Now. Chris. there was a guy
in here looking for you.

785
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:05.478
- Oh. yeah?
- Out-of-towner.

786
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.326
Ah.

787
01:05:09.893 --> 01:05:11.878
Fancy suit?
Government-type?

788
01:05:12.006 --> 01:05:14.725
- Couldn't find his ass in the seat of his pants?
- Yep. that's him.

789
01:05:14.854 --> 01:05:17.253
- Yeah. I'm working with him.
- That's what he said.

790
01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:20.197
Hmm.
Well. thanks. Herman.

791
01:05:20.326 --> 01:05:22.503
You have a good one.

792
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:24.293
You. too. Chris.

793
01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:28.518
- Is Captain Jacobs down below?
- Yes. sir. he is.

794
01:07:54.982 --> 01:07:56.741
"We'd like to extend
our sincerest apologies.

795
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:58.661
Christine Crawford
has admitted she cheated.

796
01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:01.670
Enclosed is the award
for first place."

797
01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:43.142
Fuck.

798
01:08:53.926 --> 01:08:56.902
- I'm actually looking forward to seeing my ex-wife.
- What?

799
01:08:57.030 --> 01:09:00.101
- Yeah. I think we're gonna get back together.
- You're brave. man.

800
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:01.925
Yeah.

801
01:09:02.726 --> 01:09:04.422
What the hell was that?

802
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:14.118
It's a ski.

803
01:09:24.069 --> 01:09:25.414
Dennis.

804
01:09:47.077 --> 01:09:48.678
How'd it go?

805
01:09:50.694 --> 01:09:52.230
I got it.

806
01:09:55.334 --> 01:09:56.838
How's that knittin' going?

807
01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:58.438
Done.

808
01:09:58.565 --> 01:10:02.534
Well. it seems like
an opportune time

809
01:10:02.662 --> 01:10:05.766
to try it out.
don't you think?

810
01:10:05.894 --> 01:10:08.165
- Right now?
- Why not?

811
01:10:09.222 --> 01:10:11.334
Got some heft.

812
01:10:12.933 --> 01:10:14.342
Ah.

813
01:10:17.222 --> 01:10:19.238
- Now...
- Ooh.

814
01:10:20.198 --> 01:10:21.605
Ah.

815
01:10:22.406 --> 01:10:23.525
Fine work.

816
01:10:23.654 --> 01:10:25.606
A slight miscalculation.

817
01:10:26.566 --> 01:10:29.030
Probably a little
stress-knitting.

818
01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:31.141
Oh. we always wanted
a bigger bed.

819
01:10:32.101 --> 01:10:34.021
There's the man I married.

820
01:10:35.109 --> 01:10:37.606
Ruthie.
I want to apologize.

821
01:10:39.398 --> 01:10:42.886
I lost perspective and lately.
I've been a little...

822
01:10:43.814 --> 01:10:47.174
self-absorbed and not much
of a partner to you.

823
01:10:47.974 --> 01:10:50.405
There's been a lot of talk
about quitting.

824
01:10:50.534 --> 01:10:52.358
and. well.
that's not who we are.

825
01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:54.726
Or. it's not who I am
and...

826
01:10:55.622 --> 01:10:56.454
I'm sorry.

827
01:10:56.582 --> 01:10:59.462
We've been at this
a long time. love.

828
01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:00.518
This isn't easy.

829
01:11:00.646 --> 01:11:02.310
We knew it wouldn't be
when we started.

830
01:11:02.438 --> 01:11:04.806
I guess I just let it
get away from me.

831
01:11:04.934 --> 01:11:07.110
Then let's take it back.

832
01:11:07.238 --> 01:11:09.126
We need to do that.

833
01:11:13.126 --> 01:11:14.246
You found me.

834
01:11:14.373 --> 01:11:15.622
<i>This is Captain Jacobs.
over.</i>

835
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:17.349
What can I do for you.
Captain?

836
01:11:17.478 --> 01:11:19.718
<i>I just followed up with the
brass on your supply requests.</i>

837
01:11:19.846 --> 01:11:21.445
<i>Had them put
a double-time on it.</i>

838
01:11:21.574 --> 01:11:22.598
Good.

839
01:11:22.726 --> 01:11:23.717
<i>Say again?</i>

840
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:27.526
- Affirmative.
- <i>Copy that. Over and out.</i>

841
01:11:27.654 --> 01:11:29.318
- Come here.
- Why?

842
01:11:29.446 --> 01:11:32.230
Well. maybe I just
want to embrace my wife.

843
01:11:32.357 --> 01:11:34.054
- Oh. is that all?
- Hmm.

844
01:11:34.182 --> 01:11:35.686
What's wrong with that.
Mrs. Cringle?

845
01:11:35.814 --> 01:11:38.150
I thought you wanted me
to mend your bag.

846
01:11:38.278 --> 01:11:39.941
Yeah. I do.

847
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:41.798
But. um. later.

848
01:13:05.318 --> 01:13:08.230
What are you thinking?

849
01:13:08.357 --> 01:13:10.471
I'm thinking.

850
01:13:10.598 --> 01:13:13.702
you know. the good
does outweigh the bad.

851
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:15.014
Mm-hmm.

852
01:14:14.374 --> 01:14:15.430
Hey.

853
01:14:19.686 --> 01:14:21.062
Hey.

854
01:14:22.085 --> 01:14:23.558
Hey. uh...

855
01:14:24.549 --> 01:14:26.662
Just take it easy.
little fella.

856
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:28.326
Okay?

857
01:14:29.446 --> 01:14:31.525
That's not a toy.

858
01:14:32.358 --> 01:14:34.213
You one of
Captain Jacobs's men?

859
01:14:34.342 --> 01:14:37.222
Yes. I am. I'm one
of Captain Jacobs's men.

860
01:14:37.831 --> 01:14:39.942
So put it down
on the ground.

861
01:14:40.421 --> 01:14:41.766
Right now.

862
01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:50.854
What's this?

863
01:14:50.981 --> 01:14:52.135
I have no idea.

864
01:14:52.262 --> 01:14:54.950
What's going on?

865
01:15:04.711 --> 01:15:06.214
Oh. shit.

866
01:15:08.102 --> 01:15:11.814
Pressure. Henshaw.
Press down on it. son.

867
01:15:19.846 --> 01:15:21.574
Where's Chris?

868
01:15:25.606 --> 01:15:26.949
Shit.

869
01:15:31.942 --> 01:15:34.118
- Hey. hey. hey. What's going on?
- They're shooting.

870
01:15:34.246 --> 01:15:35.782
- Who is? The soldiers?
- I-I don't know.

871
01:15:35.909 --> 01:15:38.629
Go. I'm initiating
barricade protocol yellow!

872
01:15:38.758 --> 01:15:41.605
- Get into the domestic wing!
- Go. go. go!

873
01:15:41.734 --> 01:15:44.518
Dobson. McCranie. Phillips.

874
01:15:44.645 --> 01:15:45.670
We are under fire.

875
01:15:45.798 --> 01:15:48.389
- Aaron. Sophie. doors. right now.
- Stay close.

876
01:16:07.173 --> 01:16:09.895
7. you all get your asses
ready to move.

877
01:16:10.022 --> 01:16:11.302
I'm getting you
outta here.

878
01:16:22.693 --> 01:16:23.589
Go. go. go!

879
01:16:31.911 --> 01:16:34.053
7! 7!

880
01:16:34.182 --> 01:16:35.558
Get over here!
Come on!

881
01:16:38.405 --> 01:16:39.655
7!

882
01:16:39.782 --> 01:16:41.446
7. where are you going?

883
01:16:42.886 --> 01:16:45.029
Oh. what now?

884
01:16:45.158 --> 01:16:46.533
All right. Yeah?

885
01:16:46.662 --> 01:16:48.070
<i>Chris!
We're under attack!</i>

886
01:16:48.198 --> 01:16:49.829
- 7?
- <i>Chris!</i>

887
01:17:00.742 --> 01:17:03.046
I'll take the Walker too.

888
01:17:07.846 --> 01:17:10.949
Go. go. go. go!

889
01:17:20.326 --> 01:17:21.991
Come on! Come on!

890
01:17:22.117 --> 01:17:23.686
Close the door!

891
01:17:25.957 --> 01:17:28.294
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

892
01:17:56.613 --> 01:17:58.150
Fuck!

893
01:18:25.446 --> 01:18:27.653
That's enough!

894
01:18:53.991 --> 01:18:55.558
Jonathan Miller.

895
01:18:56.422 --> 01:18:58.373
You twisted child.

896
01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:04.359
And I always thought
you forgot about me.

897
01:19:12.549 --> 01:19:14.086
You remember this?

898
01:19:15.622 --> 01:19:18.918
This was the only goddamn
thing you ever got me.

899
01:19:29.382 --> 01:19:34.054
After all the times
that I wrote you.

900
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:39.653
I'm sorry. son.

901
01:19:42.151 --> 01:19:44.453
There are limits
to what I can do.

902
01:19:46.213 --> 01:19:48.646
I couldn't replace
your parents.

903
01:19:51.205 --> 01:19:52.455
Yeah.

904
01:19:53.478 --> 01:19:54.789
You couldn't.

905
01:19:58.215 --> 01:20:00.006
Well. here we are.

906
01:20:02.533 --> 01:20:06.469
I've come for your head.
fat man!

907
01:20:09.382 --> 01:20:11.141
You think
you're the first?

908
01:20:14.021 --> 01:20:17.829
You think I got this job
because I'm fat and jolly?

909
01:23:05.286 --> 01:23:07.143
Stop now! Stop!

910
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:08.677
It's over.

911
01:25:20.678 --> 01:25:21.734
I'm sorry.

912
01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:50.917
Chris?

913
01:25:52.326 --> 01:25:54.118
Chris. love?

914
01:25:59.302 --> 01:26:02.405
It's okay.
Just try and relax.

915
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:57.254
Helga!

916
01:26:58.310 --> 01:27:01.029
I'll be working in my room
for the rest of the evening.

917
01:27:01.158 --> 01:27:03.142
so no interruptions.

918
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:04.326
Yes. Mr. Wenan.

919
01:27:04.454 --> 01:27:06.918
Why are you calling me
about this now?

920
01:27:07.045 --> 01:27:09.478
How can there be
that much missing?

921
01:27:09.606 --> 01:27:12.134
Oh. I want this tracked.

922
01:27:12.262 --> 01:27:15.014
Find out where
it was cashed.

923
01:27:15.142 --> 01:27:17.094
Then check my signatures.

924
01:27:17.221 --> 01:27:21.093
Call the bank. Tell them to
keep an eye on all my accounts.

925
01:27:21.222 --> 01:27:24.742
If there's a rat.
I want to snap its little neck.

926
01:27:47.206 --> 01:27:49.126
We'll see
who catches the rat.

927
01:28:02.502 --> 01:28:06.342
Damn it. Helga.
I said no interruptions.

928
01:28:08.102 --> 01:28:12.038
Don't you speak English?
I said stay out.

929
01:28:13.989 --> 01:28:15.526
Who the hell are you?

930
01:28:16.486 --> 01:28:17.926
I'm Ruth.

931
01:28:18.949 --> 01:28:21.542
And this is Chris.

932
01:28:32.582 --> 01:28:34.534
Billy.

933
01:28:35.558 --> 01:28:36.933
Well...

934
01:28:38.118 --> 01:28:40.262
I can't say
I'm surprised.

935
01:28:41.446 --> 01:28:43.045
Mmm.

936
01:28:52.134 --> 01:28:54.726
Yeah. Fentanyl.

937
01:28:55.558 --> 01:28:57.414
That'll get the job done.

938
01:29:03.686 --> 01:29:05.702
This is partly my fault.

939
01:29:06.854 --> 01:29:10.310
You know. I just haven't quite
been myself lately. have I. dear?

940
01:29:10.438 --> 01:29:11.845
Mm-mmm.

941
01:29:12.646 --> 01:29:15.974
But the time has come
to turn things around.

942
01:29:16.645 --> 01:29:19.781
I've decided to be proactive.

943
01:29:21.286 --> 01:29:23.206
And it starts with you.

944
01:29:26.982 --> 01:29:29.477
Ow. Ow. Ow.

945
01:29:31.397 --> 01:29:32.709
Ow.

946
01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:58.150
Now look at me. child.

947
01:30:01.190 --> 01:30:03.558
I said look at me.

948
01:30:04.838 --> 01:30:08.007
A wicked soul
bent on bloodshed

949
01:30:08.133 --> 01:30:09.862
was sent
to collect my head.

950
01:30:09.991 --> 01:30:15.846
Like you. he thought he lived
outside of morals and consequence.

951
01:30:17.477 --> 01:30:20.646
He is now buried
with his lack of reverence.

952
01:30:21.766 --> 01:30:24.005
One more time.
Billy Wenan.

953
01:30:24.134 --> 01:30:26.086
once more.

954
01:30:26.215 --> 01:30:29.605
and you'll be getting more
than coal in your stocking.

955
01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:33.542
If your grandmother
meets an early grave.

956
01:30:34.405 --> 01:30:38.022
if Christine Crawford
suffers so much as a cold.

957
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:43.397
if anybody that crosses your path is made
to feel less or lower because of you...

958
01:30:44.742 --> 01:30:46.533
I'm coming back.

959
01:30:48.166 --> 01:30:52.709
I'll come while you sleep
and rip you from your covers.

960
01:30:52.838 --> 01:30:57.766
By my hand. you will know the
consequence of your actions.

961
01:31:00.133 --> 01:31:02.214
So don't screw it up.

962
01:31:06.054 --> 01:31:09.286
The fat man's
got his eye on you. kid.

963
01:31:41.031 --> 01:31:42.373
Mmm.

964
01:32:04.678 --> 01:32:06.790
Why don't you all take 15?

965
01:32:06.918 --> 01:32:08.805
Uh. I'd really
rather not.

966
01:32:08.935 --> 01:32:10.982
I wasn't asking.

967
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:12.646
If there's one thing
I've learned. 7.

968
01:32:12.775 --> 01:32:14.822
it's never argue with
a woman gifting cookies.

969
01:32:14.949 --> 01:32:17.766
Oh. I'll tell the crew
we're on a break.

970
01:32:17.893 --> 01:32:20.487
Yeah. I'll take one of
those. if you don't mind.

971
01:32:20.613 --> 01:32:22.789
Aren't you supposed
to be taking it easy?

972
01:32:22.918 --> 01:32:24.038
I am.

973
01:32:29.478 --> 01:32:32.871
We'll have this place up in no
time. bigger and better than before.

974
01:32:32.998 --> 01:32:34.630
And we're gonna
keep it that way.

975
01:32:34.758 --> 01:32:36.325
We are.

976
01:32:37.062 --> 01:32:38.917
Lovely.
