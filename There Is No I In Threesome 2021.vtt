Yeah.

23
00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.166
Maybe I shouldn't have
the strap around my wrist

I make films.

75
00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:24.000
We got engaged one year ago

76
00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:27.541
and have been in an open
relationship for three months.

77
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:29.333
which means we are
mostly committed

78
00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:32.791
but allowed to cheat
on each other.

79
00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:35.083
Zoe is the love of my life.

80
00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:38.166
but I always felt like I didn't
make the most of my 20s.

81
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.458
that I was
a sexual underachiever.

82
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:42.875
So with the wedding as
the finishing line.

83
00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.541
being open seems
like the perfect way

84
00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.083
to get that out of my system.

85
00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:50.541
I am part German. though.

86
00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:53.166
so I did insist on some rules.

87
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.958
Zoe: You want me
to read it out?

88
00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:56.791
Ollie: Do you mind
if you read them out?

89
00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:58.208
OK. let me get it.

00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:00.791
This is the
"Monogamous Manifesto."

91
00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:02.541
the rules that
we have set up

92
00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:05.333
to safeguard
our love.

93
00:05:05.416 --> 00:05:10.541
What if your man
becomes grubby. lazy...

94
00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:11.791
What do you mean.
"becomes"?

[Laughter]

96
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.916
Zoe: Rule number one--

97
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.958
our primary goal is to
create a fun. happy.

98
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.375
healthy sexually
exciting relationship

99
00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:23.250
with each other.

100
00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:24.708
Satisfying our
libidos and egos

101
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.958
always comes second
to the health

102
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:28.791
and happiness of
our relationship.

103
00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:30.041
Do you love me?

104
00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:32.708
How much?

[Chuckling]

106
00:05:36.291 --> 00:05:37.625
That much.

107
00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:39.250
The second rule of
the manifesto.

108
00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:40.958
which states that
there is to be

109
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:43.000
plenty of warning before
sleeping with someone else

110
00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:46.375
and that only samesies--
same-sex encounters--

111
00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:47.791
are permitted.

112
00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:49.791
But I just fucked a guy.
so we're way past that.

113
00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:51.416
Yeah. yeah.
I'm growing a lot

114
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.708
because we have to talk
a lot about stuff--

115
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:55.083
Talk 'cause we're
doing this.

116
00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:56.375
But also. you know.

117
00:05:56.458 --> 00:05:57.958
before something
happens and afterwards.

118
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.000
Zoe. voice-over:
Rule number 3--

119
00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:01.416
honesty is paramount.

120
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.208
and we talk about
every encounter.

121
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:05.625
Do you need to talk.
boyfriend-husband?

122
00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:07.041
Do you want to
talk about it?

123
00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:08.458
I've got so much detail.

124
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:10.166
Ollie: No. no. that's
good. I'm fine.

125
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.875
I've got so much to tell
you about. his oblong--

126
00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:13.166
OK. that's fine. That's
fine. I'm fine. Ugh.

127
00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:17.000
Ollie. voice-over: Zoe and I
are making this film together.

128
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.666
And. yes. as if
all this sleeping around

129
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.791
isn't self-indulgent enough.

130
00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:26.958
here we are making what
is essentially a selfie film.

131
00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:29.208
[Laughter]

132
00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:33.958
Using mainly our phones.

133
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:37.333
the camera is only ever
an arm's length away.

134
00:06:37.416 --> 00:06:39.166
This is natural.
isn't it?

135
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.458
So I've put your phone
in the corner there.

136
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:44.375
You want me to put
my phone where?

137
00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:45.541
I've just put it
on a tripod.

138
00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:47.041
Just leave it there.

139
00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:48.500
Yeah. that's
good. Yup.

140
00:06:48.583 --> 00:06:50.708
Ollie. voice-over:
Same for the microphones.

141
00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:53.000
Like here...

142
00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:54.041
I'm in charge of it...

143
00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:55.291
and here...

144
00:06:55.375 --> 00:06:56.750
and here.

145
00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.416
Don't. Is it right on
the back of the pants or...?

146
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.208
I mean...

147
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.625
Ollie: OK. Do I need
to show off

148
00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:06.458
all the gear I got.
do you think?

149
00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:08.333
Are people
gonna care?

150
00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:10.083
Zoe: They don't care
about your gear.

151
00:07:10.166 --> 00:07:12.125
You know what they do
care about. though. babe?

152
00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:14.291
You know what they
are gonna like?

153
00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:15.458
The carrot?

154
00:07:15.541 --> 00:07:16.875
No. not the carrot.

155
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:17.916
And you
fellating it.

156
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.500
[Chuckling]
No.

157
00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:21.125
No. they're gonna
care about

158
00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:23.125
what's in the other
package.

159
00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:24.750
This gear?

160
00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:26.416
Uh-uh-uh.

161
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.416
Ollie. voice-over:
Using us as the main subjects.

162
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.333
the idea is to highlight
an alternative to monogamy.

163
00:07:31.416 --> 00:07:34.125
That you can have your
cake and eat it. too.

164
00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:36.208
I love cake.

165

Zoe: No. no. Come on.

167
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.500
OK. Can you please
tell us. Ollie.

168
00:07:42.583 --> 00:07:45.666
what is that
that you have there?

169
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.708
And please pull it up
into shot.

170
00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:51.625
Further into shot. Higher.
Higher. higher. higher.

171
00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:53.208
high--yeah. Good.
Now we got it.

172
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:54.625
What is it. Ollie?

173
00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:57.875
It's a pumping device.

174
00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.541
For?

175
00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:01.625
Um. for you. really.

176
00:08:01.708 --> 00:08:05.875
You bought--well. what
are you gonna pump for me?

177
00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:08.041
OK. This is how it works.
Give me a carrot.

178
00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:10.666
[Laughs]
Give you a carrot?

179
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.208

an open relationship.

Is that how you're
gonna say it?

618
00:25:54.666 --> 00:25:56.958

a bit expositional.

wasn't it. like--

together.

stories. Abstract. like poetry.

in her sleep. too.

likes herself. That's hard.

She tells the sun off
for rising too late.

647
00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:31.791
And I get to ride
in her wake.

648
00:27:31.875 --> 00:27:34.666
Oh! That was supposed
to be a "Whoo!."

649
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.791

at the same time.

650

And five--
she's smarter than me.

651
00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:44.208
She has a bigger vocabulary
because she reads more.

652
00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:46.458
I used to argue
that I'm visual instead.

653
00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:48.333
that we are equals.

654
00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:50.375
1. 2. 3.

655
00:27:50.458 --> 00:27:53.291

smart as the things you do.

a girlfriend...

Why do you have
a girlfriend

got a fiancee?

Why not?

more versions of myself.

one of them.

threatened. though.

gonna be part of it.

material. He's not--

That doesn't mean
that he

964

can't have a relationship
in the future.

965
00:43:39.416 --> 00:43:41.000
It just means that now
he's unavailable.

966

Yeah. but with me.

967
00:43:42.375 --> 00:43:44.000
he doesn't want kids
or anything. so...

968
00:43:44.083 --> 00:43:48.083

Ollie attractive.

my husband-boyfriend.

saying that. Yeah.

all around me.

he didn't want Tom's dong
touching his baby.

You know Saint Bathans

Shirin: Yeah.

1008
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.791
I was there. and I was
walking around a lake.

1009

There's a beautiful
lake.

1010
00:46:07.458 --> 00:46:10.500
and then I suddenly
slipped and fell. and--

1011
00:46:10.583 --> 00:46:11.833
When?

1012
00:46:11.916 --> 00:46:13.166
Oh. just a couple
of weeks ago.

1013
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.750
And then?

1014
00:46:14.833 --> 00:46:17.500
And then I looked around
if someone saw me fall.

1015
00:46:17.583 --> 00:46:20.166
And then I became
curious as to why

1016
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.375
my first response
was to check

1017
00:46:22.458 --> 00:46:24.250
if someone else
saw me fall

1018
00:46:24.333 --> 00:46:25.666
and where that
comes from.

1019
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.666

looking for

1020
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.333
some sort of
connection with someone

1021
00:46:29.416 --> 00:46:31.708

I'm not alone.

Yeah.

1072
00:48:34.375 --> 00:48:35.708
And so you've never
had an experience

1073
00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:37.083
with polyamory.
obviously. so--

1074
00:48:37.166 --> 00:48:38.583
No. Like. what you said

1075
00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:40.958
I've got to check on
the Internet what that means.

And it's gonna be
kind of happy ending

1079
00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.000
with our wedding?

1080
00:48:50.708 --> 00:48:52.333

then we stop this.

1084
00:48:57.875 --> 00:49:00.000
and we'll just be
monogamous.

1085
00:49:00.083 --> 00:49:02.000
just her and I.
you know?

1086
00:49:02.083 --> 00:49:05.583
So it's just to have
a bit of fun

1087
00:49:05.666 --> 00:49:07.291
before we get married.

1088
00:49:07.375 --> 00:49:09.166
So you're gonna
show all that.

1089
00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.125

enough to work my ass off.

then others--people can--

and intimacy can be like.

but you're always behind
the camera.

1411
01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:49.000
so you're kind of taking
away that vulnerability

1412
01:04:49.083 --> 01:04:50.291
because you are...

01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:51.708

behind the camera.

1593
01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:24.916
I think--Ollie. yeah.

1594
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.125
I think we should
call off the wedding.

1595
01:17:27.208 --> 01:17:29.000
Ollie: What?

1596
01:17:29.083 --> 01:17:30.375
When you love someone.

1597
01:17:30.458 --> 01:17:32.250
you think you'll love
them forever.

1598
01:17:32.333 --> 01:17:34.583
but you really need
to. like. maintain

1599
01:17:34.666 --> 01:17:35.875
the thing.

1600
01:17:35.958 --> 01:17:37.208
Ollie: You're
always pretending.

1601
01:17:37.291 --> 01:17:39.541
Babe. I wasn't pretending.

1602
01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:41.333
I fell in love with you...

1603
01:17:41.416 --> 01:17:44.041
And I loved you. and I've
loved you...

1604
01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:46.375
for 3 1/2 years.

1605
01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:47.708
Ollie:
And that stopped?

1606
01:17:47.791 --> 01:17:50.291
I think it stopped.
Ollie: When?

1607
01:17:50.375 --> 01:17:53.333
When I fell in love
with someone else.

1608
01:17:53.416 --> 01:17:55.541
When I fell in love
with someone else.

1609
01:17:55.625 --> 01:17:57.458
When I fell in love
with someone else.

1610
01:17:57.541 --> 01:18:01.291
When I fell in love
with someone else.

1611
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:09.250
Oh. fuck.
That's sad. Ollie.

1612
01:18:09.333 --> 01:18:11.125
You all right?
Yeah.

1613
01:18:11.208 --> 01:18:12.708
Are you...?

1614
01:18:12.791 --> 01:18:14.416
No. genuinely fine.

1615
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.791
That was good.

1616
01:18:15.875 --> 01:18:19.333
It started off quite
aggressive and defensive.

1617
01:18:19.416 --> 01:18:20.875
which is fine later.

1618
01:18:20.958 --> 01:18:22.750
but it was already there
at the start.

1619
01:18:22.833 --> 01:18:24.250
Ah. so was it? OK.

1620
01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:26.166
And after
"I'm perfect for you."

1621
01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:27.750
give it a solid pause.

1622
01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.416
So then straight
into another one?

1623
01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.916
Yup.

1624
01:18:42.375 --> 01:18:44.875
Ollie. voice-over:
The story of this film started

1625
01:18:44.958 --> 01:18:46.625
almost 5 years ago.

1626
01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:50.250
My fiancee and I decided to
make a documentary about us.

1627
01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:54.291
exploring alternatives
to monogamy.

1628
01:18:54.375 --> 01:18:57.875
Our documentary became my film

1629
01:18:57.958 --> 01:19:01.333
when she left me
for the new guy--Tom.

1630
01:19:02.875 --> 01:19:06.000
3 years later.
with permission from my ex.

1631
01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:10.125
I cast an actress. Natalie.
to finish the film with.

1632
01:19:10.208 --> 01:19:12.416
5 part. 3A.
take one.

1633
01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:13.750
100. take 3.

1634
01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:15.250
Man: Mark 2 for the GoPro

1635
01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:17.083
and the handheld.

1636
01:19:17.166 --> 01:19:20.000
Ollie. voice-over: Natalie
also became the co-writer.

1637
01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:22.958
Together we watched the original
documentary footage.

1638
01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:26.166
the parts we could use
and what we would recreate.

1639
01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:27.958
Let's look back
to what we had

1640
01:19:28.041 --> 01:19:31.333
before we started
this madness.

1641
01:19:31.416 --> 01:19:33.875
We were perfect.

1642
01:19:33.958 --> 01:19:35.375
Ollie's ex on video:
It was perfect for you.

1643
01:19:35.458 --> 01:19:37.750
Natalie:
Oh. fuck.

1644
01:19:40.416 --> 01:19:41.958
[Laughs]

1645
01:19:42.041 --> 01:19:43.625
[Laughs]

1646
01:19:43.708 --> 01:19:45.083
Good night...

1647
01:19:45.166 --> 01:19:46.750
Zoe: It was good to
watch my man be virile

1648
01:19:46.833 --> 01:19:48.000
with another woman.

1649
01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.083
Like. rawr.

1650
01:19:49.166 --> 01:19:51.166
Whirr?
What are you?

1651
01:19:51.250 --> 01:19:53.333
Vi--viral?
Virile.

1652
01:19:53.416 --> 01:19:54.333
Virile.

1653
01:19:54.416 --> 01:19:55.291
Yeah. Virile.

1654
01:19:55.375 --> 01:19:56.416
What's that mean?

1655
01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.875
With male potency.

1656
01:19:57.958 --> 01:19:59.333
Cool. That should be
my middle name.

1657
01:19:59.416 --> 01:20:01.333
That should be
my middle name.

1658
01:20:01.416 --> 01:20:04.041
[Laughter]

1659
01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:05.625
What are you
doing. you idiot?

1660
01:20:05.708 --> 01:20:06.875
So the camera can
pick it up.

1661
01:20:06.958 --> 01:20:08.333
Well. it's--it's
more cinematic.

1662
01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:10.000
You're thinking more
about how it looks

1663
01:20:10.083 --> 01:20:11.541
than about
how it feels.

1664
01:20:11.625 --> 01:20:12.916
My leg was adumbo.

1665
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Akimbo.

1666
01:20:14.083 --> 01:20:15.500
Ollie: Akimbo.

1667
01:20:16.791 --> 01:20:17.916
It's kind of weird.

1668
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.208
I feel like a creepy old man

1669
01:20:19.291 --> 01:20:22.541
that sort of
recreates his old life.

1670
01:20:22.625 --> 01:20:23.958
Yeah. Cut. Fuck.

1671
01:20:24.041 --> 01:20:25.291
You got that.
You got what you wanted.

1672
01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:26.875
Woman: Yeah. it's great.

1673
01:20:26.958 --> 01:20:28.541
It didn't feel
authentic.

1674
01:20:28.625 --> 01:20:30.041
What didn't feel
authentic?

1675
01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:31.458
That's not
how it happened.

1676
01:20:31.541 --> 01:20:33.000
Natalie:
It's great. Ollie.

1677
01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:34.541
Woman: You don't need
another take. Ollie.

1678
01:20:34.625 --> 01:20:36.166
Ollie: You guys are
just full of shit.

1679
01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:40.166
Ollie. voice-over:
Siobhan is real.

1680
01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:42.916
My mother is real.

1681
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.750
Bowie and Wilbur. real.

1682
01:20:47.833 --> 01:20:50.166
And this is the voice
of my real ex.

1683
01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:52.083
Ollie's ex: Pretend like
I just said something

1684
01:20:52.166 --> 01:20:53.833
that's kind of
a bit shocking

1685
01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:55.250
and surprising.

1686
01:20:55.333 --> 01:20:57.958
No. don't act. Ohh.
you're the worst.

1687
01:20:58.041 --> 01:20:59.916
[Laughs]

1688
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.083
Ollie. voice-over: While she
has moved on from the project.

1689
01:21:02.166 --> 01:21:05.125
she is happy for me to use
some of our recordings.

1690
01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:08.625
[Ollie's ex humming on video]

1691
01:21:08.708 --> 01:21:12.583
Ollie on video: What if your
man diminishes in his shine.

1692
01:21:12.666 --> 01:21:16.333
becomes grubby.
stinky. lazy.

1693
01:21:16.416 --> 01:21:17.750
mooches over...

1694
01:21:17.833 --> 01:21:19.416
Ollie's ex: What do you
mean. "becomes"?

1695
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.916
[Ollie and ex
laughing on video]

1696
01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:29.291
Ollie: Yeah.
let's cut that out.

1697
01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:32.000
[Ex laughing]

1698
01:21:32.083 --> 01:21:34.541
[Sound of wind blowing]

1699
01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:46.250
[Needle buzzing]

1700
01:21:50.625 --> 01:21:52.208
Ollie:
Pull my sleeve back.

1701
01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:53.958
Oh. for fuck's sake.

1702
01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:56.083
When did you
get this?

1703
01:21:56.166 --> 01:21:58.541
As soon as she
broke up with me.

1704
01:21:58.625 --> 01:22:00.416
It better not
be a dick.

1705
01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:01.500
[Laughs]

1706
01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:02.791
Why?

1707
01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:04.583
It's to remind me of
the lessons learned

1708
01:22:04.666 --> 01:22:05.833
in the last two weeks.

1709
01:22:05.916 --> 01:22:07.166
[Hesitantly]
That's good.

1710
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:08.916
[Laughter]

1711
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.666
Yeah. I was thinking
I'm gonna get a square

1712
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:12.666
and a triangle
on this one.

1713
01:22:15.416 --> 01:22:17.833
Ollie. voice-over:
I got the tattoo to remember

1714
01:22:17.916 --> 01:22:20.041
my flaws and become better.

1715
01:22:20.125 --> 01:22:23.458
that I can't have my
cake and eat it. too.

1716
01:22:23.541 --> 01:22:24.875
But in the years following.

1717
01:22:24.958 --> 01:22:27.708
emotions rewrote
the story in my head.

1718
01:22:27.791 --> 01:22:30.958
I recast myself as the victim

1719
01:22:31.041 --> 01:22:35.125
over and over again.

1720
01:22:36.916 --> 01:22:39.708
But rewatching
what actually happened.

1721
01:22:39.791 --> 01:22:42.500
turns out I forgot
the worst version of me.

1722
01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:45.458
You are in competition
with my career.

1723
01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:47.541
Ex: What do you mean?

1724
01:22:47.625 --> 01:22:49.708
Like. my career is
as important to me

1725
01:22:49.791 --> 01:22:51.333
as you are.

1726
01:22:51.416 --> 01:22:53.541
Ex: Well. what if we
don't have enough money

1727
01:22:53.625 --> 01:22:55.041
to have a wedding?

1728
01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:56.875
Then we postpone
our wedding.

1729
01:22:56.958 --> 01:22:59.125
It's my fucking
industry.

1730
01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:02.000
I can only have
so much certainty.

1731
01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:06.791
She is a nymphomaniac.
She needs it a lot.

1732
01:23:12.625 --> 01:23:13.708
Ow.

1733
01:23:13.791 --> 01:23:15.750
You are a complete
asshole.

1734
01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:20.041
No wonder she left you.

1735
01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:23.666
[Loud thud.
muffled sound of waves]

1736
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:25.666
Ollie. voice-over: The truth is

1737
01:23:25.791 --> 01:23:28.791
I neglected her pain
in all of this.

1738
01:23:28.875 --> 01:23:31.083
I wouldn't stop filming.

1739
01:23:31.166 --> 01:23:33.625
even as our relationship
fell apart

1740
01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:38.458
because It made for
a good story of me falling.

1741
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.333
Natalie: OK. good.

1742
01:24:07.166 --> 01:24:09.333
Oh. that was good.

1743
01:24:11.166 --> 01:24:12.833
Natalie: OK. so the fall
was quite good.

1744
01:24:12.916 --> 01:24:14.958
but then the deliberate
sticking out of the leg

1745
01:24:15.041 --> 01:24:18.333
afterwards was
very manufactured.

1746
01:24:18.416 --> 01:24:19.958
OK. the fall was good.

1747
01:24:20.041 --> 01:24:23.375
Now you need to work on
your acting afterwards.

1748
01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:25.666
[Ollie grunts. chuckles]

1749
01:24:30.125 --> 01:24:31.916
[Yells]

1750
01:24:36.041 --> 01:24:37.583
Ollie. voice-over:
If I'm honest.

1751
01:24:37.666 --> 01:24:39.750
I was never right for
an open relationship

1752
01:24:39.833 --> 01:24:42.333
or polyamory.

1753
01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:44.041
Looking back. maybe her and I

1754
01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:46.958
just weren't as good
a match as I remembered.

1755
01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:48.625
They say an optimist is

1756
01:24:48.708 --> 01:24:51.666
only ever two people away
from a threesome.

1757
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:55.000
That's all bullshit.
A bunch of scheisse.

1758
01:24:55.083 --> 01:24:59.500
I think next time.
I'll just have cake.
