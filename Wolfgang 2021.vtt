(indistinct chatter)

5
00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.869
-Welcome.
-WOLFGANG: How are you?

6
00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:39.831
-Long time no see.
-We all got gray hair. all of a sudden.

7
00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:42.167
-And how did that happen?
-Yeah. You lost weight.

8
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.878
-I want to look like you.
-(laughs)

9
00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:48.798
MAN 1: Oh. have you had this one yet?
Oh. it's excellent.

10
00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:53.386
Mmm.

11
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:56.765
MAN 1: Restaurant business
is a tough business.

12
00:00:56.848 --> 00:01:00.268
Yeah. to stay in business
is not easy because you have to change.

13
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.437
You have to work more so now than ever.

14
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.898
You know. before.
the world was moving slow.

15
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:08.193
-It's moving too fast now.
-Now it's like in overdrive.

16
00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:12.447
WOLFGANG: <i>I don't like to talk
about the past too much</i>

17
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.619
<i>because I start thinking
how much time is there left.</i>

18
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.460
At my age now. I probably should say.
"Wolfgang. slow down and take it easy."

19
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.089
But it's quite the opposite.

20
00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:35.970
Mmm.

21
00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:41.684
<i>As a younger chef. my mentor told me.</i>

22
00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:45.688
"Wolfgang. you're gonna have
many opportunities out there.

23
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:51.319
<i>But the opportunities
are just like trains in a train station.</i>

24
00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:55.031
<i>You have to grab and hop on one train</i>

25
00:01:55.573 --> 00:01:57.742
<i>and. hopefully. it takes you
in the right direction.</i>

26
00:01:57.826 --> 00:01:59.869
<i>hopefully. it takes you
where you want to go."</i>

27
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:03.915
<i>And that's really how I've lived my life.</i>

28
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.378
Ladies and gentlemen. our next guest
is one of the great chefs of the world.

29
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.548
and his restaurants
are some of the finest on the planet.

30
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.926
Please welcome our own friend.
a fine chef. Wolfgang Puck.

31
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.428
(audience applause)

32
00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.143
Wolfgang. without a doubt.
was the first celebrity chef.

33
00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:27.647
Hello. everybody. How we doing. all right?

34
00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:31.317
Oh! Look how beautiful.

35
00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.279
NANCY: <i>He has so many restaurants</i>

36
00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:36.781
<i>and so many
different types of restaurants.</i>

37
00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:39.284
All the products
that he has on the shelves.

38
00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:42.120
you know. I can't even keep up
with them anymore. to tell you the truth.

39
00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.127
Mm.

40
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.921
(lively music)

41
00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.886
WOLFGANG:
Hello. good afternoon. are we ready?

42
00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:58.970
ALL: Yes. chef.

43
00:02:59.053 --> 00:03:01.014
All right. what are we making?

44
00:03:01.097 --> 00:03:03.808
EVAN:
<i>The biggest misconception about Wolf.</i>

45
00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:08.021
is that he is just a celebrity chef
and like can't cook.

46
00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.273
Okay. Are you finished
with the agnolotti or what?

47
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:13.026
EVAN: <i>But nothing could be farther
from the truth.</i>

48
00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:14.569
Good. yeah.

49
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.118
The Mt. Rushmore of California cuisine.
Wolf's right there in the middle.

50
00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:27.081
EVAN: <i>He's a founding father
of the way we eat in this country.</i>

51
00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:33.338
The biggest restaurant
that everybody knows. Spago. Spago. Spago.

52
00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:38.676
When Wolf opened Spago.
he changed the way Americans eat.

53
00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:44.974
RUTH: <i>He put pizzas on the menu
in a fancy restaurant.</i>

54
00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.602
And that was revolutionary.

55
00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:50.188
Put them on the fire.
We need for 20 people.

56
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.444
One of the big innovations
to come out of Spago was the open kitchen.

57
00:03:57.278 --> 00:04:00.698
LAURIE: <i>It elevated the chef
because what is going on in the kitchen.</i>

58
00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.952
is as important as who is in those seats.

59
00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:06.996
-I'm gonna go in the dining room. okay?
-Yes. chef.

60
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.582
-I'll see you in a few minutes.
-All right.

61
00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:15.380
Hello. how are you? How are you?

62
00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:20.301
EVAN: <i>Wolf brought the chef into the
limelight as someone to be talked about.</i>

63
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.136
<i>someone to be written about.</i>

64
00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:27.642
He changed the perception in the public
for what a chef is.

65
00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:32.063
You know what you have to try for sure
is our agnolotti with truffles.

66
00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:35.483
His life.
it's about embracing the possibility.

67
00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:39.946
RUTH: <i>Taking every opportunity
that you're given and going with it.</i>

68
00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:46.744
Wolfgang doesn't have an end game.
maybe that's why he's still at it.

69
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.540
NANCY: <i>He hasn't figured out
what that end game is.</i>

70
00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:01.217
(birds chirping)

71
00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.642
(doorbell ringing)

72
00:05:11.602 --> 00:05:14.022
(Christina in German)

73
00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:18.192
(in German)

74
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:14.207
(sizzles)

75
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.125
(in English)
My cookbooks here. look at that.

76
00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:17.960
Almost all of them. huh?

77
00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.420
-CHRISTINA: Yeah.
-Oh. you have all of them.

78
00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.255
I have all of yours. yeah.

79
00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:23.216
Wow.

80
00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:25.635
WOLFGANG: <i>As a kid.</i>

81
00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:28.805
<i>the kitchen was the only place...</i>

82
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.517
where I felt safe.

83
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.644
(tranquil music)

84
00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:40.691
WOLFGANG: <i>I grew up really poor.</i>

85
00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:46.989
<i>We didn't have running water in the house.
We didn't have a toilet.</i>

86
00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:54.163
<i>But on Sunday for lunch. I would help
my mother make wiener schnitzel.</i>

87
00:06:55.456 --> 00:06:57.125
<i>Maybe some mashed potatoes.</i>

88
00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:01.045
<i>It was like my favorite thing to do.</i>

89
00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:06.676
(Christina in German)

90
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.741
(in English)
RUTH: <i>Wolf was illegitimate.</i>

91
00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:37.665
His mother was a villager
in this little town in Austria.

92
00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:44.088
<i>After she had Wolf.
she married a coal miner.</i>

93
00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:51.637
who was really abusive to Wolf
and Wolf's sister and Wolf's mother.

94
00:07:53.514 --> 00:07:57.351
WOLFGANG:
<i>Life with my stepfather was really rough.</i>

95
00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:01.189
He terrorized us.

96
00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:09.113
<i>He would say you are so lazy.
You are good for nothing.</i>

97
00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:15.036
His voice really got into my head.

98
00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:24.045
<i>I remember being like eight.
nine years old.</i>

99
00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:26.797
<i>and he would come home drunk.</i>

100
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:32.595
<i>and say. "You go in the forest
and pick your stick."</i>

101
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:37.683
<i>I felt like something in my inside
was shrinking.</i>

102
00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:44.649
<i>And I said.
"You know. I want to get out of here."</i>

103
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.031
(audience cheer)

104
00:08:52.114 --> 00:08:55.660
Hello. I'm Wolfgang Puck.
I'm here on the world-famous red carpet.

105
00:08:55.743 --> 00:08:58.996
celebrating Hollywood's biggest night.
the Academy Awards.

106
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.958
-Congratulations.
-Thank you so much.

107
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.626
Great food. Great food.

108
00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:07.755
REPORTER 1: <i>This is a preview of the food
that Wolfgang Puck is preparing.</i>

109
00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:11.926
<i>This is our chocolate Oscars
which are covered in 24-carat gold.</i>

110
00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.555
Some good news. they found Nemo.

111
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.473
(audience laugh)

112
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.601
The bad news. he's in one
of Wolfgang Puck's puff pastries.

113
00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.855
(indistinct chatter)

114
00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:29.569
RUTH: <i>When I first started
writing about food in the '70s.</i>

115
00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:32.613
being a chef was a blue-collar job.
It was a terrible job.

116
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.199
<i>People knew who owned the restaurant.</i>

117
00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:38.160
<i>They rarely knew who did the cooking.</i>

118
00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:44.166
And Wolf changes that in a really big way.

119
00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.338
MICHAEL: <i>When he opened Spago.</i>

120
00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:54.635
Wolfgang Puck did something
that no one had ever done in the past.

121
00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:57.680
<i>Celebrities loved going there.</i>

122
00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:00.891
<i>I was a young agent in the '80s.</i>

123
00:10:00.975 --> 00:10:05.980
every time I would call a client
and give them a choice of where to go.

124
00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:08.566
choice one. two. and three was Spago.

125
00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:10.943
(upbeat music)

126
00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:20.328
The restaurant opened at six o'clock
and it was packed from six o'clock.

127
00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:22.204
and the last reservation was at 11.

128
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.877
JANNIS: <i>I would look at the reservations
and I would assign the tables.</i>

129
00:10:28.586 --> 00:10:33.090
<i>There were about two dozen tables
in the front room that ran along Sunset.</i>

130
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:36.177
<i>The B and B-minus tables
were on the west side.</i>

131
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.057
<i>The A tables were on the east side.
that was the prime real estate.</i>

132
00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:47.521
<i>I read the Hollywood Reporter
to keep up with what was going on.</i>

133
00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:51.233
If something happened and you knew
that somebody wasn't as powerful any more.

134
00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:53.611
man. you know. they lost their standing.

135
00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.946
(indistinct chatter)

136
00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:03.537
JANNIS: <i>I would put Sean Penn
on table two. Steven Segal in table 20.</i>

137
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:06.248
<i>Arnold Schwarzenegger here.
Tony Curtis there.</i>

138
00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.626
<i>Tom Cruise there. Paul Newman there.</i>

139
00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:15.132
MARK: <i>One time Michael Caine.
Sean Connery and Sidney Poitier came in.</i>

140
00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:18.719
They had a table of six people.
right in the middle of the dining room.

141
00:11:19.303 --> 00:11:23.849
No one around them would leave.
And that happened all the time.

142
00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:26.727
(indistinct chatter)

143
00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:33.693
RUTH: <i>Because celebrities loved Spago.</i>

144
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.947
<i>he got know all the movie stars
and the directors.</i>

145
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.243
and the perception of what a chef was.
was starting to change.

146
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.039
Good night. See you soon.

147
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.087
(bird chirps)

148
00:12:00.678 --> 00:12:02.888
That's Mittagskogel.

149
00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:07.560
So. they call it... Mittags is noon.

150
00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:11.355
And it's the noon mountain
because in the summertime.

151
00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:14.817
the sun at twelve o'clock.
it's right above it.

152
00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.573
See that's the little island here
where we swam out here.

153
00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:22.742
from the hotel in the back there.

154
00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:11.749
WOLFGANG: <i>When I look back and think
about my childhood here.</i>

155
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.043
<i>it's really difficult.</i>

156
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.592
<i>I was starting to love cooking</i>

157
00:13:22.092 --> 00:13:24.762
<i>and I couldn't wait
to get out of the house.</i>

158
00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:28.599
<i>So. when I finished school. when I was 14.</i>

159
00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:34.021
<i>my mother found me a job at the Post Hotel
as a cook's apprentice.</i>

160
00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:39.735
<i>I was so excited. but my stepfather said.
"Oh. you're gonna be back in one month.</i>

161
00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:41.862
<i>and you're never gonna be anything.</i>

162
00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:45.533
<i>If you are a real man.
stay out of the kitchen."</i>

163
00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:52.248
I decided at that moment.
I want to prove him wrong.

164
00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:59.672
<i>My job was peeling the potatoes.
cleaning the kitchen.</i>

165
00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:03.884
I didn't do any cooking
but I was just happy to be there.

166
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.180
<i>Everybody just looked at me and said.
"What is this little kid doing here?</i>

167
00:14:08.264 --> 00:14:09.807
<i>He should be in school. you know."</i>

168
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:13.644
I was so nervous that I'm going
to screw up and have to go home.

169
00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.564
<i>That was my biggest fear.</i>

170
00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:23.654
<i>And then one day in the middle of lunch.
we ran out of mashed potatoes.</i>

171
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:27.658
At the end of lunch.
the chef called me over.

172
00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:30.077
and told me that I was good for nothing.

173
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.248
I don't know why they hired you.
And I remember his red face.

174
00:14:34.331 --> 00:14:36.959
He had this huge belly
and he was screaming at me.

175
00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:40.921
and I was like this. tiny.
a 95-pound kid. you know.

176
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.717
He fired me and kicked me
out of the restaurant.

177
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.802
(dramatic music)

178
00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:55.394
WOLFGANG: <i>In my head.
I said. "I cannot go home."</i>

179
00:14:57.688 --> 00:15:02.526
<i>The last thing I want to have
is my stepfather say.</i>

180
00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.695
<i>"Yeah. I told you so. You're back now."</i>

181
00:15:08.532 --> 00:15:11.535
<i>By that time. it was almost dark.</i>

182
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:17.791
<i>I walked to the bridge
over the Drau River.</i>

183
00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:24.048
<i>And I stood up there.
looking down in the really dark river.</i>

184
00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:30.846
<i>and thinking.
at home. I get this negativity.</i>

185
00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:35.267
<i>This feeling that I'm good for nothing.</i>

186
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.354
<i>Now. it happened again.</i>

187
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.025
<i>Maybe I am good for nothing.</i>

188
00:15:44.234 --> 00:15:45.694
<i>Maybe I shouldn't be here.</i>

189
00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:50.866
<i>Maybe that's the solution.</i>

190
00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:57.206
<i>So. I stood there for about an hour.</i>

191
00:15:58.457 --> 00:16:04.380
<i>And then all of a sudden. I decided.
I don't want to give up.</i>

192
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.176
I'm gonna go back tomorrow
and see what happens.

193
00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:19.937
<i>The next morning at 6:30 a.m..
I went back to the hotel.</i>

194
00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:24.817
The chef starts screaming at me and says.

195
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.069
"I told you. you're good for nothing.
to go home."

196
00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:30.322
<i>I said. "I'm not going home."</i>

197
00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:33.450
So. I dug my little heel in
and as they tried to grab me.

198
00:16:33.534 --> 00:16:35.953
I moved back
and I says. "I'm not leaving."

199
00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:39.623
<i>He didn't know what to do.</i>

200
00:16:40.624 --> 00:16:43.752
<i>So. he called the owner of the hotel.</i>

201
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.383
The owner says. "Well. if he's
so determined to stay here.

202
00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:51.468
maybe I will send him to the other hotel."

203
00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.971
They owned another little hotel
called the Park Hotel.

204
00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:55.347
and we'll see what happen.

205
00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:00.686
<i>To me was like. "Oh. my god.
a present fell from heaven."</i>

206
00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:04.565
<i>I learned that nothing comes easy.</i>

207
00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:08.277
But giving up is not an option.

208
00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:16.160
(whirring)

209
00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:25.461
-WOLFGANG: Who made the olive rolls today?
-CHEF 1: I did. chef.

210
00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:26.628
-Huh?
-CHEF 1: I did. chef.

211
00:17:26.712 --> 00:17:28.505
-Very nice.
-CHEF 1: Thank you. chef.

212
00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:36.555
-Is that an appetizer or main course?
-Appetizer. sir.

213
00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:45.397
WOLFGANG: <i>Early on at Spago.
we used to make smoked salmon.</i>

214
00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:49.151
<i>with brioche and dill cream
and it was very popular.</i>

215
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:56.700
<i>One day. the restaurant was crazy busy.</i>

216
00:17:57.618 --> 00:17:59.703
And we run out of brioche.

217
00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.167
<i>All of a sudden. Joan Collins comes in.</i>

218
00:18:06.668 --> 00:18:09.129
<i>She was like the biggest star
on television.</i>

219
00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:13.634
and she always wanted smoked salmon.
And I said. "What I gonna give her?"

220
00:18:13.717 --> 00:18:16.303
<i>We didn't have baguettes.
we didn't have any bread.</i>

221
00:18:17.054 --> 00:18:19.598
And you know you don't want
to make Joan Collins mad.

222
00:18:20.182 --> 00:18:21.141
(thwacks)

223
00:18:21.225 --> 00:18:23.560
(tense music)

224
00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:26.105
WOLFGANG:
<i>So. I stretched out a pizza dough.</i>

225
00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.567
<i>Added some finely chopped onions.</i>

226
00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.488
<i>and baked it for a few minutes.</i>

227
00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:38.534
<i>And I put some dill cream on it.</i>

228
00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.328
<i>I put the smoked salmon.
cut really thin on it.</i>

229
00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:47.709
A few dollops of caviar.
and I said. "Wow. this is perfect."

230
00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:54.716
I think. the best food comes from somebody
that knows the rules.

231
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.093
and then can break 'em.

232
00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:00.639
NANCY: <i>What's interesting
about the smoked salmon pizza was that.</i>

233
00:19:00.722 --> 00:19:03.976
<i>it had no tomato sauce
and it had no cheese.</i>

234
00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:06.103
As simple as that sounds today.

235
00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:09.690
I don't think anyone had done
a pizza like that before.

236
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.986
REPORTER 2: <i>Sometimes. when you ask
Wolfgang Puck what's cooking.</i>

237
00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:17.364
<i>you may not understand the answer.
but you're bound to like it.</i>

238
00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:21.285
LAURIE: <i>When it came to food.
Wolf was always willing.</i>

239
00:19:21.368 --> 00:19:25.205
to go in a different direction
and take big risks.

240
00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:33.505
NANCY: <i>With Chinois. he wanted
to use his French techniques.</i>

241
00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:35.674
<i>to complement Chinese cooking.</i>

242
00:19:36.758 --> 00:19:38.927
That was the beginning of fusion.

243
00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:42.014
(upbeat music)

244
00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.684
(sizzling)

245
00:19:47.227 --> 00:19:52.900
EVAN: <i>Wolf's Chinese chicken salad
at Chinois birthed this explosion.</i>

246
00:19:52.983 --> 00:19:56.778
of the Asian chicken salad
forever and ever.

247
00:19:56.862 --> 00:20:02.659
Like you can go to like supermarket
and find Asian chicken salad in a bag.

248
00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:03.952
Like. he did that.

249
00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.288
MAN 2: Making chicken salad. right.
Chinese chicken salad.

250
00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:08.040
WOLFGANG: Excellent Chinese chicken salad.

251
00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:15.464
Sometimes. I think. inventions come
where you least expect it.

252
00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:18.634
WOLFGANG: <i>All of a sudden.
out of necessity.</i>

253
00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:20.219
<i>something good comes out.</i>

254
00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:43.992
<i>I got really lucky when I got the job
at the Park Hotel.</i>

255
00:20:45.118 --> 00:20:48.872
<i>I started to stamp the French fries.
peeled onions.</i>

256
00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:52.125
<i>They showed me how to make
the pancakes in the pans.</i>

257
00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:55.796
<i>Little by little I started to get better.</i>

258
00:20:57.547 --> 00:20:58.840
(in German)
RESTAURATEUR: Right. Here you go.

259
00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:00.509
And wiener schnitzel.

260
00:21:00.592 --> 00:21:02.844
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your meal.

261
00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:04.346
Thank you.

262
00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:08.058
Just a little.

263
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:10.936
(in English)
WOLFGANG: <i>I was so proud of myself</i>

264
00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:13.939
<i>when I could heat up some peas
or some carrots</i>

265
00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:15.899
<i>or make the chicken soup.</i>

266
00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:20.362
<i>It made me feel really good
about what I was doing.</i>

267
00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:31.581
<i>About two and a half years
into the apprenticeship.</i>

268
00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:34.793
we had a French restaurant from Dijon

269
00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:38.922
come and cooked for a week in the hotel.

270
00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:45.512
<i>They did all these things I never saw.</i>

271
00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:53.270
<i>I was so inspired by French cooking
that I knew at that point.</i>

272
00:21:53.353 --> 00:21:56.982
I had to go to France
and experience it and learn it.

273
00:21:57.232 --> 00:21:59.359
(lively music)

274
00:22:01.862 --> 00:22:05.907
WOLFGANG: <i>I was 19 years old
when I started at Baumanière.</i>

275
00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:09.036
<i>a famous three-star restaurant in France.</i>

276
00:22:10.245 --> 00:22:14.416
<i>They had like five French cooks there
and I was the youngest one.</i>

277
00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:17.336
and I didn't speak French.
It was pretty rough.

278
00:22:19.629 --> 00:22:23.425
<i>We had a huge farm there
with six gardeners.</i>

279
00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:29.222
<i>They brought the finest green beans
or apricots or great melons.</i>

280
00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:33.435
<i>So. we cooked
with only the best ingredients.</i>

281
00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:38.565
The flavors felt so amazing.
I had never experienced that.

282
00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:41.276
This was a revelation for me.

283
00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:46.698
<i>Raymond Thuilier. the owner.
was a perfectionist.</i>

284
00:22:48.992 --> 00:22:52.412
<i>One day. he made a sauce
and he said. "Taste it."</i>

285
00:22:52.496 --> 00:22:57.084
I tasted it and said. "Oh. I would put
a little lemon juice and a little pepper."

286
00:22:57.167 --> 00:22:59.378
He said. "Okay. put a little lemon juice
and pepper."

287
00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:06.676
He tasted it and he says.
"Oh. good. much better."

288
00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:12.641
<i>He made me feel appreciated.</i>

289
00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:18.397
He made me feel like. "Ah. I can do that
as well as anybody in the kitchen."

290
00:23:19.856 --> 00:23:25.237
<i>After that. Raymond Thuilier
really became my mentor.</i>

291
00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:30.158
And I said. "I want to be a chef.
I want to be like him."

292
00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:35.580
(light music)

293
00:23:42.546 --> 00:23:44.548
(indistinct chatter)

294
00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.968
WOLFGANG: <i>After I came to France.</i>

295
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:52.347
<i>my life started
to take steps up. up. up all the time.</i>

296
00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:56.685
<i>I was always thinking about the future.</i>

297
00:23:58.061 --> 00:23:59.813
I was still upset at my stepfather.

298
00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:02.983
and did not want to have
nothing to do with him.

299
00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:07.487
<i>So. I didn't talk to my family
for a year and a half.</i>

300
00:24:08.905 --> 00:24:10.782
I never wrote a letter nor nothing.

301
00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:16.913
<i>I wanted to stay as far away
from home as possible.</i>

302
00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:21.460
(tranquil music)

303
00:24:28.091 --> 00:24:29.593
CHRISTINA:

304
00:24:38.101 --> 00:24:42.522

305
00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:55.202
(sobs)

306
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:05.420
(in English)
WOLFGANG: <i>One day. at Baumanière.</i>

307
00:25:05.504 --> 00:25:09.758
<i>the dishwasher says.
"You know. I listen to the radio.</i>

308
00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:13.845
<i>and the Austrian embassy
in Paris is looking for you.</i>

309
00:25:15.388 --> 00:25:18.475
Nobody has any news.
nobody knows where you are.

310
00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:20.685
And they think you're dead."

311
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:24.814
And so I wrote my mother a note
and said. "You know I'm in Provence.

312
00:25:24.898 --> 00:25:27.984
I like it here and everything is fine.
Don't worry."

313
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:35.033
<i>I felt bad leaving my family but I said.</i>

314
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:39.996
"I don't care what happened.
I will never come back home."

315
00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:47.045
(lively music)

316
00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:53.385
Every kid dreams about coming to America.

317
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:57.597
WOLFGANG: <i>In America. everybody is rich.
Everybody drives a Cadillac.</i>

318
00:25:58.557 --> 00:26:02.602
<i>So. when I was 24. I came to California.</i>

319
00:26:04.145 --> 00:26:05.564
<i>I had very little money.</i>

320
00:26:06.314 --> 00:26:10.026
<i>So. I found an apartment
in a retirement home on Bunker Hill.</i>

321
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.236
<i>with my friend Guy.</i>

322
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:14.781
<i>cockroaches on the staircases
and everything.</i>

323
00:26:14.864 --> 00:26:16.616
but what do you want for 80 bucks?

324
00:26:17.867 --> 00:26:23.373
<i>I got a job working in a restaurant.
And I was the night chef there.</i>

325
00:26:23.456 --> 00:26:26.501
<i>But it was like
the opposite of Baumanière.</i>

326
00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:32.215
<i>Things had to be flown in frozen.
no fresh ingredients.</i>

327
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:36.553
<i>I got so many steaks back. and they said.
"No. it's not well done enough."</i>

328
00:26:36.636 --> 00:26:40.640
And I said.
"Oh. no. this is nothing I imagine.

329
00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:41.975
This is terrible."

330
00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:47.522
HENRY: <i>This is Henry the magician.
And here's your frozen food magic.</i>

331
00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:50.233
ANNOUNCER 1:
<i>Children often need between-meal snacks.</i>

332
00:26:50.317 --> 00:26:51.985
<i>snacks like Hostess Twinkies.</i>

333
00:26:52.068 --> 00:26:54.279
<i>They help your child go and grow.</i>

334
00:26:54.362 --> 00:26:55.405
ANNOUNCER 2: <i>Stop!</i>

335
00:26:55.488 --> 00:26:58.033
<i>You don't have to peel onions
or mess with garlic.</i>

336
00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:00.535
<i>Taste Tap push-button foods are here.</i>

337
00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:05.498
It's hard to remember today
what food was like in America in the '70s.

338
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.085
RUTH: <i>We were very ashamed.</i>

339
00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:13.214
<i>We thought of American food
as hamburgers. hot dogs.</i>

340
00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:15.383
<i>we don't have anything good here.</i>

341
00:27:17.802 --> 00:27:20.764
<i>People were used to tasteless tomatoes.</i>

342
00:27:20.847 --> 00:27:24.476
<i>and produce that had
no flavor and no aroma.</i>

343
00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:28.897
French chefs would come over and say.

344
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.483
"Oh. my god.
I have to import everything from France."

345
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:38.531
In those days. restaurants
were just about sauce and meat.

346
00:27:38.615 --> 00:27:41.159
<i>maybe a flaming dessert or something.</i>

347
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.828
<i>Food had gotten into a big rut.</i>

348
00:27:50.377 --> 00:27:55.090
WOLFGANG: <i>After two months or so
of working in the restaurants downtown.</i>

349
00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:58.426
<i>I walked one day to get an espresso.</i>

350
00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:02.097
<i>And all of a sudden.
I see my friend from Paris.</i>

351
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.432
<i>and I said.
"What the hell are you doing here?"</i>

352
00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:08.395
And he said. "Well. I'm working
in a restaurant called Ma Maison."

353
00:28:10.063 --> 00:28:13.983
<i>The owner is the nephew
of the owner of La Tour d'Argent.</i>

354
00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:16.945
<i>three-star restaurant from Paris.</i>

355
00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:19.239
So. I said.
"Wow. that must be an amazing restaurant."

356
00:28:19.322 --> 00:28:21.491
Maybe you can help me find a job.

357
00:28:23.952 --> 00:28:26.788
<i>He got me a job as a cook at Ma Maison.</i>

358
00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:28.206
I was so excited.

359
00:28:28.915 --> 00:28:31.793
<i>But the first day I walked in.</i>

360
00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:37.215
<i>and I see Astroturf on the floor
and plastic chairs and everything.</i>

361
00:28:37.298 --> 00:28:41.761
Not even a walk-in refrigerator.
They had refrigerators lined up outside.

362
00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:46.391
I said. "Oh. my god. this is the nephew
of the owner from La Tour d'Argent."

363
00:28:46.474 --> 00:28:48.476
(upbeat music)

364
00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.396
<i>Patrick was very arrogant.</i>

365
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.360
He had always a nice suit on
with the little carnation here.

366
00:28:57.444 --> 00:29:01.698
and talked like he had the best restaurant
in Los Angeles.

367
00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:03.491
<i>but it was nothing.</i>

368
00:29:04.617 --> 00:29:07.537
RUTH: <i>Circa. 1979. 1980.</i>

369
00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:11.583
<i>the restaurateur thought he was the guy.</i>

370
00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:14.961
And the chef was the blue-collar guy

371
00:29:15.044 --> 00:29:17.881
toiling away in the kitchen. expendable.

372
00:29:29.893 --> 00:29:31.895
PATRICK:

373
00:29:40.403 --> 00:29:42.322
WOLFGANG: <i>So. I start working there.</i>

374
00:29:42.947 --> 00:29:46.576
And two weeks later.
I saw the worst review.

375
00:29:49.704 --> 00:29:52.123
<i>So. Patrick fired the chef there.</i>

376
00:29:52.207 --> 00:29:55.710
And he said. "Wolfgang. take over
the restaurant and be the chef here."

377
00:29:56.628 --> 00:29:58.338
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

378
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.175
But Ma Maison had a really bad reputation.

379
00:30:02.258 --> 00:30:05.011
And boy. when I looked
in that refrigerator.

380
00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:09.599
<i>the only food available was a frozen meat.</i>

381
00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:12.727
And I said.
"Hell. no. I cannot cook like that."

382
00:30:22.445 --> 00:30:24.864
(sizzles)

383
00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:34.541
WOLFGANG: <i>After I got the job.
people laughed about it.</i>

384
00:30:34.624 --> 00:30:36.501
<i>because there was nobody
going to Ma Maison.</i>

385
00:30:37.377 --> 00:30:41.673
<i>Everybody said. "Oh. my god. you made
a mistake to go to this restaurant."</i>

386
00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:47.470
<i>A lot of people think the grass
is always greener somewhere else.</i>

387
00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:52.976
<i>They say. "Well. I have a problem here.
let's throw in the towel and quit."</i>

388
00:30:54.727 --> 00:30:59.440
But I believe the grass is greener
where you water it the most.

389
00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:06.322
<i>If you put in the effort and put in
the work. no it only can get better.</i>

390
00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:15.164
<i>When I started at Ma Maison.
the food was terrible.</i>

391
00:31:15.248 --> 00:31:18.418
<i>So. I said. "How we gonna fix that?"</i>

392
00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:23.381
You start with the best product
and then you don't screw it up.

393
00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:27.594
TOM: <i>In a wide-open space.
20 miles north of San Diego</i>

394
00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:30.013
<i>sits a modest roadside stand.</i>

395
00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:34.642
<i>By contrast. fancy cars line up
at the shack six days a week.</i>

396
00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:37.020
<i>They come to buy Tom Chino's produce.</i>

397
00:31:37.103 --> 00:31:40.481
<i>the most carefully grown fruits
and vegetables anywhere.</i>

398
00:31:41.107 --> 00:31:45.445
WOLFGANG: <i>When I went the first time
to the Chino Farm in Rancho Santa Fe.</i>

399
00:31:45.528 --> 00:31:48.907
<i>and I saw all the vegetables there.</i>

400
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.743
<i>my eyes lit up and I said.</i>

401
00:31:51.826 --> 00:31:56.247
"Oh. my god.
this is as good as Baumanière.

402
00:31:56.331 --> 00:31:57.582
I can really cook."

403
00:31:57.665 --> 00:32:00.168
(lively music)

404
00:32:02.128 --> 00:32:07.008
RUTH: <i>Wolf was the first person in L.A.
to find the Chino Ranch.</i>

405
00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:11.137
<i>He started using their fantastic produce.</i>

406
00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:17.477
Suddenly. he's serving this very
simple food that's incredibly flavorful.

407
00:32:18.561 --> 00:32:22.982
Making these salads that people would go
"Oh. my god. this is a tomato?"

408
00:32:24.567 --> 00:32:26.486
<i>And that was really new.</i>

409
00:32:31.532 --> 00:32:35.828
The quality of the ingredients became
so much a part of the food at Ma Maison.

410
00:32:35.912 --> 00:32:37.372
Where's our tuna?

411
00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:40.375
NANCY: <i>He made a daily trip
to the fish market.</i>

412
00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:45.755
He made a weekly two-hour-plus trip
to pick up vegetables.

413
00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:48.299
That was very. very unique.

414
00:32:50.009 --> 00:32:55.098
LAURIE: <i>He showed us how to make
American food in a whole new way.</i>

415
00:32:55.848 --> 00:33:00.812
Bringing it all together and making it
feel like this is California on a plate.

416
00:33:00.895 --> 00:33:04.732
It's fantastic. you’re gonna love it.
and bon appétit.

417
00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:05.817
(laughs)

418
00:33:07.402 --> 00:33:10.613
WOLFGANG: <i>It was hard the first six months
but I worked hard.</i>

419
00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:14.701
And little by little. the restaurant
started to get better.

420
00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:16.536
and I was so proud of it.

421
00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:22.917
To get a table in the restaurant
was pretty much almost impossible.

422
00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:27.964
MICHAEL: <i>Wolf was in the kitchen.
never to be seen.</i>

423
00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:31.467
<i>making food like none of us
had ever eaten before.</i>

424
00:33:33.219 --> 00:33:38.433
<i>But the restaurant really revolved
around Patrick Terrail.</i>

425
00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:47.275
ROBIN:
<i>Hollywood's Ma Maison has terrific food</i>

426
00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:49.068
<i>and an unlisted phone number.</i>

427
00:33:49.152 --> 00:33:51.529
<i>It's one of Tinseltown's
hottest lunch spots.</i>

428
00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:54.824
<i>and nobody cares if the dining area
is a former parking lot.</i>

429
00:33:54.907 --> 00:33:56.451
<i>covered with Astroturf.</i>

430
00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:59.662
<i>It's so popular
that jetsetters jockey for a table.</i>

431
00:33:59.746 --> 00:34:02.749
<i>and everyone wants to make friends
with the waiters.</i>

432
00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:06.836
WOLFGANG: <i>Working at Ma Maison was crazy.</i>

433
00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:08.588
So right now. with my lobster.

434
00:34:08.671 --> 00:34:12.091
WOLFGANG: <i>I would wake up early.
go to the market downtown.</i>

435
00:34:12.175 --> 00:34:15.386
<i>buy fresh ingredients
and then drive to Ma Maison</i>

436
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:19.640
where I worked from five in the afternoon
until two or three in the morning.

437
00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:23.061
We knew clubs who started to open up
at two in the morning.

438
00:34:23.144 --> 00:34:26.981
and we used to hang out
until the day came up every day.

439
00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:29.692
(upbeat music)

440
00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:33.738
WOLFGANG:
<i>One night. I went to dance with a girl.</i>

441
00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:36.491
<i>We talked and she said. "What do you do?"</i>

442
00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:40.620
And I said. "I'm a cook. I'm a chef."
And she looked at me. "A cook?"

443
00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:44.332
The song was over.

444
00:34:44.415 --> 00:34:47.376
she left me on the dance floor
and walked away from me.

445
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.045
I was like. "What? What did I do?"

446
00:34:49.128 --> 00:34:51.798
I didn't even walk on her toes
or anything.

447
00:34:51.881 --> 00:34:54.133
So from then on. when I went to a club.

448
00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:56.385
I always said I'm a racecar driver
in Europe.

449
00:34:57.261 --> 00:34:59.722
Okay. we're going to add our milk
to our egg yolks and...

450
00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:03.935
WOLFGANG: <i>At that time. I was teaching
cooking classes at Ma Maison.</i>

451
00:35:04.018 --> 00:35:07.980
And one day. I looked up
while I was making my butter sauce.

452
00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:10.316
and there in the back was Barbara.
She's snacking.

453
00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:14.070
BARBARA: <i>I walked into the class
and sat down.</i>

454
00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:18.157
Wolf looked up for a moment
and he spotted me.

455
00:35:18.241 --> 00:35:22.620
and he had a big.
like a big wad of butter in his hands

456
00:35:22.703 --> 00:35:26.707
and he proceeded
to just drop it on the floor.

457
00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:32.171
And things progressed
rather quickly after that.

458
00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:34.340
(tranquil music)

459
00:35:37.718 --> 00:35:39.512
WOLFGANG: <i>Barbara was the beautiful woman.</i>

460
00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:43.850
<i>She was very outgoing
and she was very smart and talented.</i>

461
00:35:47.436 --> 00:35:51.607
BARBARA: <i>He was very sweet and
he was very focused on what he was doing.</i>

462
00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.945
<i>He was a little unattainable
in certain ways. too.</i>

463
00:35:56.696 --> 00:36:00.783
The standard joke was. if I would dress up
as a baby carrot.

464
00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:04.328
little baby carrot.
I'd probably get more attention.

465
00:36:04.912 --> 00:36:06.914
But I like a challenge.

466
00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:14.839
RUTH: <i>Barbara was really the one
pushing Wolf forward.</i>

467
00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:20.052
<i>He was the genius and the chef.</i>

468
00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:26.350
But she was the one who saw it
and said. "Don't undersell yourself.

469
00:36:26.893 --> 00:36:28.060
<i>You're really great."</i>

470
00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:34.734
(sizzles)

471
00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:37.361
Voilà. you see it starts
to get nice and brown.

472
00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:39.697
Now. should you always put
the skin down first?

473
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.408
-Does it make a difference?
-Yeah. always the skin first.

474
00:36:44.118 --> 00:36:48.164
Wolfgang was always telling me
about his dreams and desires.

475
00:36:48.247 --> 00:36:50.333
about work and wishes and he said.

476
00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:53.127
"You know. one day I would really like
to have my own restaurant."

477
00:36:53.628 --> 00:36:56.255
And I said. "Yeah. really. you should."

478
00:36:56.339 --> 00:36:58.341
Okay. we're gonna sauté
all our vegetables now.

479
00:36:58.424 --> 00:37:00.760
First. the bacon so the fat goes out.

480
00:37:00.843 --> 00:37:03.262
BARBARA: <i>One day. I found this check.</i>

481
00:37:03.346 --> 00:37:06.599
I said. "Wolf. is this your paycheck?"
He said. "Yeah."

482
00:37:06.682 --> 00:37:12.063
I said. "Is this all you make a week
for working as hard as you do?

483
00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:17.401
You should go in and ask Patrick
to double the salary."

484
00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:19.487
(dramatic music)

485
00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:25.284
WOLFGANG: <i>After I had been working there
for six years. I went to see Patrick.</i>

486
00:37:25.368 --> 00:37:28.746
And Patrick said. "You know. maybe I make
you a partner in the restaurant."

487
00:37:29.789 --> 00:37:33.334
I said. "Good."
"But I gonna pay you a little bit less."

488
00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.882
<i>Before I came to Ma Maison.
Ma Maison was almost bankrupt.</i>

489
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.636
<i>And as soon as I started.
we started to go uphill.</i>

490
00:37:44.971 --> 00:37:47.765
<i>But Patrick took all the credit for it.</i>

491
00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:52.937
<i>And he made me feel</i>

492
00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:56.232
like I'm not that important
to the restaurant.

493
00:37:59.193 --> 00:38:01.529
PATRICK:

494
00:38:04.699 --> 00:38:08.244
Ma Maison was really my house.

495
00:38:08.869 --> 00:38:11.956
You know. I build it from nothing.

496
00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:18.671
I went to Patrick and I told him
I want to be an equal partner.

497
00:38:18.754 --> 00:38:20.464
It has to be fifty-fifty.

498
00:38:31.434 --> 00:38:36.814
He pointed at me and said.
"You know. I always gonna own 51 percent."

499
00:38:37.857 --> 00:38:40.276
I pointed back on him and said. "Me too."

500
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:44.113
WOLFGANG: <i>So that was that.</i>

501
00:38:44.196 --> 00:38:46.365
<i>Then I said. "Now I have to leave."</i>

502
00:39:01.714 --> 00:39:05.301
<i>I always wanted to open my own restaurant.</i>

503
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:08.054
<i>It was my dream.</i>

504
00:39:10.473 --> 00:39:13.934
<i>But Ma Maison was the restaurant in L.A.</i>

505
00:39:14.643 --> 00:39:18.689
<i>To leave at the pinnacle. it's crazy.</i>

506
00:39:19.273 --> 00:39:21.484
(somber music)

507
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:31.202
<i>Patrick told the newspapers that
I have no idea how to run a restaurant.</i>

508
00:39:31.285 --> 00:39:33.621
<i>I'm only a cook and said.</i>

509
00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:39.377
"Wolfgang will come back in three months
begging for a job."

510
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.965
WOLFGANG:
<i>I said. "My God. this is. like. déjà vu."</i>

511
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:50.805
<i>All these crazy words reminded me
of my stepfather.</i>

512
00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:54.350
<i>It made me feel like I'm gonna fail.</i>

513
00:39:56.185 --> 00:40:00.231
BARBARA: <i>Wolf was very talented
and passionate and focused.</i>

514
00:40:01.023 --> 00:40:03.818
but I don't think
he thought enough of himself.

515
00:40:04.318 --> 00:40:08.447
He was constantly having nightmares about
what if this fails. what if this fails.

516
00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:12.576
<i>I was constantly telling him.
"You can do it.</i>

517
00:40:13.452 --> 00:40:14.578
<i>We can do this."</i>

518
00:40:15.579 --> 00:40:17.581
(tranquil music)

519
00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:27.258
WOLFGANG:
<i>The whole time. I was so nervous.</i>

520
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.261
<i>Barbara was very supportive of it.</i>

521
00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:35.724
She had also confidence in me
that I can make it work.

522
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:43.065
<i>I think. Barbara helped me remember
that I don't quit.</i>

523
00:40:43.732 --> 00:40:45.693
I don't give up easily.

524
00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:54.869
He had no idea if he was gonna be able
to actually run a business.

525
00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:57.079
I mean. this was all new to him.

526
00:40:59.165 --> 00:41:01.417
RUTH: <i>But I think it was this moment.
you know.</i>

527
00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.795
<i>either you jump off the diving board.</i>

528
00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:09.300
<i>or you resign yourself
to standing in the back of the kitchen</i>

529
00:41:09.383 --> 00:41:11.427
with your white toque on
for the rest of your life.

530
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.095
and he took the plunge.

531
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.743
BARBARA: <i>Wolfgang found
this restaurant space in Hollywood.</i>

532
00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:39.914
It was a dive. Such disrepair.

533
00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:42.291
<i>We had to get a blaster in there</i>

534
00:41:42.374 --> 00:41:46.378
to get three-inches thick grease
off the walls

535
00:41:46.462 --> 00:41:48.130
that had been there for 30 years.

536
00:41:48.923 --> 00:41:52.301
<i>I remember I was upside down
scrubbing the gum off the bottom.</i>

537
00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:54.512
<i>of all the old tables for days.</i>

538
00:41:55.095 --> 00:41:59.183
<i>We didn't have a lot of money at the time.
so we had to do what we could.</i>

539
00:42:05.105 --> 00:42:08.400
RUTH:
<i>Wolf's initial idea of opening Spago.</i>

540
00:42:08.484 --> 00:42:10.945
was that it was going to be
this little pizza place.

541
00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:14.573
like one he had gone to
in Saint-Rémy in Provence.

542
00:42:14.657 --> 00:42:16.242
checked tablecloths.

543
00:42:16.325 --> 00:42:19.537
And Barbara was the one who said. "No...

544
00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:22.706
Let's do something more ambitious."

545
00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:32.883
BARBARA: <i>I didn't have a lot of design
experience but I had done theater sets.</i>

546
00:42:32.967 --> 00:42:35.469
and I thought cooking is a show.

547
00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:39.139
It was theater and he was the star.

548
00:42:39.807 --> 00:42:44.562
<i>So. I called up 911. I said. "Could I have
the number for the fire department?"</i>

549
00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:49.233
And all I said was. "Hello. sir.
we're thinking of doing a restaurant.

550
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:55.030
that is going to have a wood-burning pizza
oven on the kitchen line.

551
00:42:55.114 --> 00:42:58.617
open in the restaurant. is that okay?"

552
00:42:58.701 --> 00:43:01.203
And he says. "Sounds okay to me. lady."

553
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:04.039
And I hung up the phone. I turned to Wolf.

554
00:43:04.123 --> 00:43:05.791
and I said we can do this.

555
00:43:05.874 --> 00:43:08.085
(lively music)

556
00:43:10.713 --> 00:43:15.593
The day of opening. the nails
were still being pounded into the boards.

557
00:43:15.676 --> 00:43:17.970
I don't even think the menu was done then.

558
00:43:21.807 --> 00:43:27.187
The day we opened.
we had just gotten our final approvals.

559
00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:30.566
so I was able to turn on the stoves.
get stocks going.

560
00:43:30.649 --> 00:43:33.944
MARK: <i>I'd been going for. like.
about 40 hours without sleep.</i>

561
00:43:35.195 --> 00:43:39.074
They did not have electricity
until four o'clock in the afternoon.

562
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.037
BARBARA: <i>We were about to open that night.</i>

563
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.416
<i>and I'm still standing barefoot
on top of the exhibition counter.</i>

564
00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:49.460
getting everything adjusted correctly.

565
00:43:49.543 --> 00:43:52.588
food's still coming through the door.
everybody's trying to get dressed.

566
00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:56.342
<i>And then the doors opened. and...</i>

567
00:43:58.385 --> 00:44:00.179
organized pandemonium.

568
00:44:00.512 --> 00:44:02.514
(lively music)

569
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.023
WOLFGANG: <i>To my surprise.
from the first day.</i>

570
00:44:11.106 --> 00:44:13.025
<i>it became an instant success.</i>

571
00:44:13.108 --> 00:44:14.943
It was an amazing feeling.

572
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:20.366
We had so many customers.
so we were in the weeds every night.

573
00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:26.789
RUTH: <i>We have an 8:30 reservation.</i>

574
00:44:26.872 --> 00:44:29.124
and if you were lucky.
maybe you'd get seated at 10.

575
00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:33.879
I mean. you walked in there
and the energy just came up.

576
00:44:38.133 --> 00:44:41.762
We worked in the kitchen right up front.
there was a lot of noise.

577
00:44:41.845 --> 00:44:43.847
there was a lot of heat and flame.

578
00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:48.811
We were making pizzas
as fast as we possibly could.

579
00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:52.648
BARBARA: <i>You could smell the food
wafting across the room.</i>

580
00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:55.734
You saw the excitement.
You saw the food coming in and going out.

581
00:45:00.406 --> 00:45:03.617
WOLFGANG: <i>Everybody was asking
about the food. what it was.</i>

582
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:07.955
So. I went out and bought some pastel
and designed my own menu.

583
00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:10.833
<i>And put on it Spago California Cuisine.</i>

584
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.043
<i>People loved it.</i>

585
00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:20.884
MICHAEL: <i>He was making the best pizza.
the best salad.</i>

586
00:45:20.968 --> 00:45:24.555
<i>the best-grilled foods
you could eat. all very healthy.</i>

587
00:45:25.681 --> 00:45:28.434
<i>A lot of people
called it "California cuisine."</i>

588
00:45:28.517 --> 00:45:30.185
I just called it "Wolfgang's kitchen."

589
00:45:30.269 --> 00:45:32.271
(upbeat music)

590
00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:40.571
Wolfgang was just such a huge personality
and mostly because of that open kitchen.

591
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.115
JANNIS: <i>There was no other restaurant
like that.</i>

592
00:45:44.616 --> 00:45:48.162
Every night. we said the same thing.
"Curtain up."

593
00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:50.581
And I thought to myself.
"Yeah. this is Spago."

594
00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:57.421
A year after we opened.
the <i>New York Times</i> wrote a piece.

595
00:45:57.796 --> 00:46:00.007
<i>"The Spagoization of Manhattan."</i>

596
00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:02.968
BARBARA: <i>To realize that in one year.</i>

597
00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:06.346
that restaurant had affected
the way people dine.

598
00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:11.310
<i>What casual environment putting the chefs
on stage with open kitchens?</i>

599
00:46:11.393 --> 00:46:15.105
All of that. that was monumental.

600
00:46:20.652 --> 00:46:22.654
(quirky music)

601
00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:32.164
We're roasting this chicken today
on the <i>French Chef</i>.

602
00:46:32.539 --> 00:46:35.042
JULIA: You know.
we speak of a covey of quail

603
00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:38.045
and a gaggle of geese
and a pride of lions.

604
00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:41.256
Well. this is known as a peep of chickens.

605
00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:43.008
MICHAEL: <i>At that time in the '80s.</i>

606
00:46:43.091 --> 00:46:47.638
<i>Julia Child was the only big chef
who was on television.</i>

607
00:46:48.764 --> 00:46:50.098
You had a number of cooking shows.

608
00:46:50.182 --> 00:46:52.726
particularly on local stations
all over the country.

609
00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:54.853
But no one had really gone national.

610
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:58.565
Carrots.

611
00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:02.110
Mushrooms.

612
00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:08.283
And these snails were brought
into America from France as a food item.

613
00:47:09.827 --> 00:47:13.705
Tofu. it doesn't have much personality
in its raw form.

614
00:47:13.789 --> 00:47:16.250
CHEF 2:
It's simply begging to be flavored.

615
00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:20.921
Wolfgang was recognized
very quickly as an innovator.

616
00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:22.464
You can't smell it on the camera.

617
00:47:24.216 --> 00:47:25.217
MICHAEL: <i>We were friends.</i>

618
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:29.263
And I went in and one day I just said
to him. "We think you should be on TV."

619
00:47:29.346 --> 00:47:31.723
(indistinct chatter)

620
00:47:31.807 --> 00:47:34.893
MICHAEL: <i>I decided that the best way
to get him on television.</i>

621
00:47:34.977 --> 00:47:37.771
was to take the president
of ABC to dinner.

622
00:47:40.566 --> 00:47:43.986
<i>And I called Wolf up and he said.
"What would you like me to do?"</i>

623
00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:49.449
We proceeded to have one of the all-time
great-tasting menus in history.

624
00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:51.577
(light music)

625
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.622
(sizzles)

626
00:47:58.625 --> 00:48:01.003
And we proceeded to have a lot of wine.

627
00:48:04.089 --> 00:48:06.550
MICHAEL: <i>At the end of the dinner. I said.</i>

628
00:48:06.633 --> 00:48:11.513
<i>"I think. it would be great to give Wolf.
two or three appearances on GMA."</i>

629
00:48:11.597 --> 00:48:15.267
The guy said. "Sounds like a good idea."

630
00:48:16.351 --> 00:48:18.437
<i>Because I'm an agent.
I pulled out a napkin.</i>

631
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:22.608
<i>and I wrote this all out on the napkin.
dated it. and had him sign it.</i>

632
00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.943
And we had a contract.

633
00:48:28.363 --> 00:48:30.324
One of the most celebrated chefs
in Hollywood.

634
00:48:30.407 --> 00:48:31.783
is a young man named Wolfgang Puck.

635
00:48:31.867 --> 00:48:35.162
and he has cooked for all the rich
and the famous from all over the world.

636
00:48:35.245 --> 00:48:37.873
Today. he's going to cook for us
and it's nice to have you with us.

637
00:48:37.956 --> 00:48:39.541
-Thank you very much.
-Welcome. What are you cooking?

638
00:48:39.625 --> 00:48:41.627
We're going to make
a luxurious hamburger today.

639
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:42.753
-All right.
-We have here...

640
00:48:42.836 --> 00:48:47.299
WOLFGANG: <i>Being live for the first time
on national television</i>

641
00:48:47.382 --> 00:48:48.926
<i>was such a big deal for me.</i>

642
00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:50.969
...different. we have here
a little bit of blue cheese.

643
00:48:51.053 --> 00:48:54.848
I was confident in my cooking.
but I was nervous looking at the cameras.

644
00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:58.644
which camera to look at.
I wanted it to be perfect.

645
00:48:58.727 --> 00:49:00.228
<i>So that way they ask me to come back.</i>

646
00:49:00.312 --> 00:49:02.940
Put it right in the middle
and close it up.

647
00:49:03.023 --> 00:49:05.484
MICHAEL:
<i>In those days. it was a very simple way</i>

648
00:49:05.567 --> 00:49:08.028
<i>of defining what was successful.</i>

649
00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:11.031
<i>by how many calls came
into the switchboard at the network.</i>

650
00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:13.075
WOLFGANG: We're gonna sauté them
really fast.

651
00:49:13.492 --> 00:49:17.537
After the first appearance.
we called everyone in our company.

652
00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:19.915
and had them call every relative they had.

653
00:49:19.998 --> 00:49:23.001
And the network lit up in L.A.
and New York.

654
00:49:23.085 --> 00:49:27.923
The switchboard lit up with people calling
saying who is that cute little guy?

655
00:49:28.006 --> 00:49:33.303
He's so fantastic. love those recipes.
all scripted by us and it worked.

656
00:49:33.387 --> 00:49:36.306
He just blew up like a movie star.

657
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:38.100
-(audience applause)
-DAVID: Hi. how are you?

658
00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.020
Best-selling pizza
is the duck sausage pizza.

659
00:49:42.104 --> 00:49:43.647
JOAN: That's what I'm talking about.

660
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:45.732
You want one too? Here.

661
00:49:45.816 --> 00:49:47.776
-(laughs)
-All right. good.

662
00:49:47.859 --> 00:49:50.529
LAURIE:
<i>Wolf started doing every morning show</i>

663
00:49:50.612 --> 00:49:51.863
<i>and late-night show.</i>

664
00:49:51.947 --> 00:49:54.449
All right. hi. The vegetables are here.
How are you?

665
00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:58.412
LAURIE: <i>He could be with David Letterman
and make jokes.</i>

666
00:49:58.954 --> 00:50:03.709
He just knew how to be himself.
and you just loved him.

667
00:50:03.792 --> 00:50:04.960
DAVID: Where do you get your recipes?

668
00:50:05.043 --> 00:50:07.838
You know. I'm cooking for 25 years already
so it's easy to make...

669
00:50:07.921 --> 00:50:09.798
You're probably younger
than I am. aren't you?

670
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:11.174
Oh. much younger. yeah.

671
00:50:12.759 --> 00:50:15.971
JANNIS: <i>Every journalist
wanted to interview him constantly.</i>

672
00:50:16.054 --> 00:50:19.433
There were always photo shoots.
It was nuts.

673
00:50:19.808 --> 00:50:21.727
It's okay. We have enough for everybody.

674
00:50:23.729 --> 00:50:26.982
RUTH: <i>In the mid '80s.
I went with him to Cleveland.</i>

675
00:50:27.065 --> 00:50:29.401
And I go with Wolf to rent a car

676
00:50:29.484 --> 00:50:33.697
and the woman in the car rental
says to him.

677
00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.158
"My God. it's Wolfgang Puck.
you're that chef."

678
00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:39.870
And I thought. "Okay. the age
of the celebrity chef has begun."

679
00:50:39.995 --> 00:50:42.247
Hello. madam. how are you?
I'm Wolfgang Puck.

680
00:50:43.248 --> 00:50:44.708
No. you're not.

681
00:50:44.791 --> 00:50:47.544
PATRICK:

682
00:50:57.596 --> 00:51:00.015
(audience cheering)

683
00:51:01.183 --> 00:51:02.184
Let's grill.

684
00:51:02.642 --> 00:51:03.602
Good morning.

685
00:51:05.145 --> 00:51:07.230
JANNIS: <i>Wolfgang Puck
deserves so much respect.</i>

686
00:51:07.314 --> 00:51:11.860
<i>for how he transformed celebrity
for chefs...</i>

687
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.405
<i>with TV shows. cook-offs.</i>

688
00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:18.325
<i>He set the stage for all of that.</i>

689
00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:22.954
PAT:
<i>The Tom Cruise of chefs is Wolfgang Puck.</i>

690
00:51:23.038 --> 00:51:25.957
<i>His own wedding was featured
on</i> The Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.

691
00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:28.627
<i>This is a cook we're talking about.</i>

692
00:51:29.461 --> 00:51:33.048
PATRICK:

693
00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:43.308
Here we go with my old car here.
My limousine is ready.

694
00:51:44.976 --> 00:51:47.979
The place is Spago's.
the legendary "in" restaurant

695
00:51:48.063 --> 00:51:51.149
owned. operated by.
and featuring the cuisine

696
00:51:51.233 --> 00:51:54.111
of the equally legendary chef.
Wolfgang Puck.

697
00:51:54.194 --> 00:51:55.904
Puck's is a household name.

698
00:51:55.987 --> 00:51:59.658
He is arguably the best-known.
most successful chef of our time.

699
00:51:59.741 --> 00:52:03.745
My dream really was to have one
little restaurant. maybe write a cookbook.

700
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:06.373
And you've made more money at it
than you ever dreamed you would.

701
00:52:06.456 --> 00:52:10.085
Yeah. absolutely. And I live better
than I ever thought I would live.

702
00:52:10.168 --> 00:52:13.755
But you know. the money aspect
is not what really drives me.

703
00:52:16.049 --> 00:52:20.470
RUTH: <i>Despite the fact
that he was enormously successful.</i>

704
00:52:20.929 --> 00:52:22.556
<i>enormously respected.</i>

705
00:52:23.723 --> 00:52:29.396
Wolf was still sort of stunned
by his success.

706
00:52:30.605 --> 00:52:35.443
When you caught him off guard.
you would find that he was afraid.

707
00:52:36.945 --> 00:52:39.531
<i>That he'd be back in the basement
peeling potatoes.</i>

708
00:52:39.614 --> 00:52:43.952
that. at any moment. you know. the coach
was gonna turn back into a pumpkin.

709
00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:46.788
So. he was not slowing down.

710
00:52:48.123 --> 00:52:50.542
All right. now we're gonna start. huh?

711
00:52:50.625 --> 00:52:52.127
BARBARA: <i>I think. all those shows.</i>

712
00:52:52.252 --> 00:52:56.006
<i>and all the press that started
to be generated led to an explosion.</i>

713
00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:58.717
It was frenetic.

714
00:52:59.217 --> 00:53:04.472
EMCEE: <i>Your restaurateur of this year
is Wolfgang Puck.</i>

715
00:53:04.556 --> 00:53:07.350
Every city he went to.
somebody was like. "Come open here.

716
00:53:07.434 --> 00:53:11.313
Come into business with us."
Everybody wanted a piece of Wolf.

717
00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.028
WOLFGANG: <i>Johnny Carson
used to come often to Spago.</i>

718
00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:20.947
One day. he said.
"Can I take some pizzas to go?"

719
00:53:21.031 --> 00:53:24.117
So. he took like a pile.
like 10. 12 pizzas to go.

720
00:53:24.784 --> 00:53:26.494
<i>And by the second or third time. I said.</i>

721
00:53:26.578 --> 00:53:28.496
<i>"Johnny.
what are you doing with my pizzas?"</i>

722
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:32.918
He says. "I put them in the freezer.
I just loved it." What the heck?

723
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.506
<i>So out of that.
really started my frozen pizza business.</i>

724
00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:45.555
RUTH: <i>Wolfgang was the first chef
since Chef Boyardee.</i>

725
00:53:45.639 --> 00:53:48.475
to say. "What if I take my food.

726
00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:52.646
and make it available to people
who are home cooks?"

727
00:53:53.939 --> 00:53:56.816
After that. he became a brand.

728
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:58.401
REPORTER 3:
<i>World-renowned chef Wolfgang Puck.</i>

729
00:53:58.485 --> 00:53:59.486
REPORTER 4: Wolfgang Puck.

730
00:53:59.569 --> 00:54:01.279
<i>Celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.</i>

731
00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:03.531
LAURIE: <i>Every month.</i>

732
00:54:03.615 --> 00:54:07.285
<i>there seemed to be a new restaurant
opening throughout California.</i>

733
00:54:07.661 --> 00:54:09.329
<i>And then around the world.</i>

734
00:54:10.288 --> 00:54:12.958
It was like how is he everywhere?

735
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:15.335
Beautiful set we get to talk about.

736
00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:17.671
BARBARA: <i>We opened Spago Las Vegas.</i>

737
00:54:17.963 --> 00:54:20.006
<i>and then we started building cafés.</i>

738
00:54:20.966 --> 00:54:24.261
Things just kept blossoming
and blossoming and blossoming.

739
00:54:24.552 --> 00:54:28.723
Now. that's what I call fusion.
I could sell them on the Internet.

740
00:54:28.807 --> 00:54:29.766
(smooches)

741
00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:32.852
WOLFGANG: <i>Everything was running
at a hundred miles an hour.</i>

742
00:54:33.019 --> 00:54:37.691
Everything was a huge success.
beyond my greatest dreams.

743
00:54:39.192 --> 00:54:43.405
<i>But I still always felt
that something is missing.</i>

744
00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:50.161
So good to have you here in Atlanta.
no less.

745
00:54:50.245 --> 00:54:52.664
In Atlanta. You are so busy.
You got the frozen pizza line.

746
00:54:52.747 --> 00:54:54.708
You got 63 restaurants.
you got all this stuff.

747
00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:56.209
you got a new four-month-old baby.

748
00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:59.296
I think. it keeps me busy.
keeps me out of trouble that way.

749
00:54:59.379 --> 00:55:00.755
I guess so.

750
00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:03.383
When I thought about becoming a father.

751
00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:08.430
and how I gonna treat my children
especially. I was so nervous.

752
00:55:08.513 --> 00:55:12.100
The last thing I wanted to be
is like my stepfather.

753
00:55:13.435 --> 00:55:17.355
WOLFGANG: <i>But Barbara had always wanted
to start a family.</i>

754
00:55:18.023 --> 00:55:22.569
<i>So. when our first child came.
I was already 40 years old.</i>

755
00:55:23.153 --> 00:55:25.864
<i>A few years later I had a second child.</i>

756
00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:30.201
But I also was expanding
like crazy at that time.

757
00:55:31.286 --> 00:55:35.206
BARBARA: <i>I think. because we were building
a business and he was always so nervous.</i>

758
00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:36.958
<i>about things not going right.</i>

759
00:55:37.042 --> 00:55:43.131
primarily. the caretaking of the children
fell to me mostly.

760
00:55:43.965 --> 00:55:46.051
<i>He was always at the restaurants.</i>

761
00:55:47.635 --> 00:55:50.138
WOLFGANG: <i>Certain nights. I say.
"Listen. I shouldn't be in the restaurant.</i>

762
00:55:50.221 --> 00:55:51.723
<i>I should be at home with my son."</i>

763
00:55:51.806 --> 00:55:54.517
But. you know.
I think. we try to juggle both of them.

764
00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:57.395
to spend time with him
and to also spend time at the restaurant.

765
00:55:57.479 --> 00:56:00.190
because we feel like the restaurants
are also our children.

766
00:56:00.273 --> 00:56:02.275
(somber music)

767
00:56:02.359 --> 00:56:04.736
MICHAEL:
<i>I felt that he was spread way too thin.</i>

768
00:56:05.487 --> 00:56:07.947
<i>I tried to get him to focus
on fewer things.</i>

769
00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:10.825
but he did what he wanted to do.

770
00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:12.952
<i>He tried to do everything.</i>

771
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.955
INTERVIEWER:
<i>How much time do you spend in the kitchen?</i>

772
00:56:16.247 --> 00:56:18.249
Are there days
when you don't cook anything yourself?

773
00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:21.669
You know. there are days when I have
to talk with accountants

774
00:56:21.753 --> 00:56:23.880
-and with lawyers and...
-Reporters.

775
00:56:23.963 --> 00:56:26.883
Yeah. no.
and that's my worst day probably.

776
00:56:29.177 --> 00:56:32.472
BYRON: <i>When I was growing up.
my dad was always working.</i>

777
00:56:35.308 --> 00:56:38.686
<i>I remember being in elementary school
and going to Spago.</i>

778
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:42.357
four nights out of the week for dinner.
just so I could have a family dinner.

779
00:56:43.733 --> 00:56:45.652
<i>It was hard to see him.</i>

780
00:56:49.989 --> 00:56:51.699
BARBARA: <i>I could not get his attention</i>

781
00:56:51.783 --> 00:56:53.952
<i>because he was busy doing this
and busy doing that.</i>

782
00:56:54.035 --> 00:56:58.206
I said. "If you want a relationship
and you want to really know your kids.

783
00:56:58.289 --> 00:57:00.250
you're gonna have to be there some time."

784
00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:03.420
I have a new thing in the office
over there for you.

785
00:57:03.503 --> 00:57:04.629
What is that?

786
00:57:06.172 --> 00:57:09.008
Well. your idea of a <i>plaisanterie</i>
and my idea of a <i>plaisanterie</i>

787
00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:10.468
are two different things so...

788
00:57:15.515 --> 00:57:17.183
NANCY: <i>Working with Wolf and Barbara.</i>

789
00:57:17.475 --> 00:57:21.729
I don't know if I've ever had worked
with such a team before.

790
00:57:23.982 --> 00:57:27.610
<i>Together. the two of them made something</i>

791
00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:31.990
that I don't think anybody else
had done before.

792
00:57:35.076 --> 00:57:36.953
<i>But at that time.</i>

793
00:57:37.036 --> 00:57:41.791
<i>journalists were so captivated by Wolfgang</i>

794
00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:44.711
<i>and his winning personality</i>

795
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:48.173
<i>that what was hard for Barbara.</i>

796
00:57:48.256 --> 00:57:51.968
is that she worked every bit as hard
as Wolfgang

797
00:57:52.051 --> 00:57:54.429
and she didn't get the attention.

798
00:57:54.512 --> 00:57:58.516
And I think that wore her down.

799
00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:02.395
(somber music)

800
00:58:04.397 --> 00:58:08.776
BYRON: <i>As a kid. I didn't understand
like what divorce was.</i>

801
00:58:10.028 --> 00:58:14.032
I didn't understand that my dad
wasn't going to be in the house anymore.

802
00:58:16.784 --> 00:58:19.913
<i>Until I went to school
on the first day of second grade.</i>

803
00:58:19.996 --> 00:58:23.583
and my mom walked me into school
and she turned me around.

804
00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:25.877
and she was like very serious
with me for a second.

805
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:29.672
She was just like. "If anyone says
anything about your parents

806
00:58:29.756 --> 00:58:33.134
or what's going on at home.
don't say anything to them.

807
00:58:33.218 --> 00:58:35.720
You don't need to.
Don't get angry with them.

808
00:58:35.803 --> 00:58:38.431
Just leave it alone.
and you can talk to me about it."

809
00:58:42.018 --> 00:58:46.147
WOLFGANG:
<i>When we got divorced. it was really hard.</i>

810
00:58:48.983 --> 00:58:52.487
<i>Barbara was always very supportive of me.</i>

811
00:58:54.906 --> 00:58:57.951
<i>She always believed in me.</i>

812
00:59:02.997 --> 00:59:08.503
<i>Often I would sit at Spago.
looking out the window...</i>

813
00:59:09.546 --> 00:59:12.924
<i>and ask myself. who am I?</i>

814
00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:19.180
<i>Am I a chef?</i>

815
00:59:21.933 --> 00:59:23.309
<i>Am I a restaurant?</i>

816
00:59:25.603 --> 00:59:27.313
<i>Am I a character?</i>

817
00:59:29.357 --> 00:59:32.527
<i>Am I a guy who has never enough?</i>

818
00:59:40.034 --> 00:59:42.036
(dramatic music)

819
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:59.512
(speaking German)

820
01:00:03.808 --> 01:00:05.810
(laughs)

821
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.932
(sniffs)

822
01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.978
(dramatic music)

823
01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:54.734
(Christina in German)

824
01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:31.896
(in English)
WOLFGANG: <i>My whole life</i>

825
01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:33.898
<i>I had this fear of failure.</i>

826
01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:38.611
I had this fear of going backwards.

827
01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:47.412
I always had this desire to be successful.

828
01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:50.415
do more and do better.

829
01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.085
<i>But at the end of the day.</i>

830
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:59.507
I didn't really know who I was
or what it was for.

831
01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:03.428
(dramatic music)

832
01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:21.112
BARBARA: <i>Our childhood memories
are visceral memories.</i>

833
01:02:23.197 --> 01:02:28.494
<i>Those memories of Austria
are part of his DNA.</i>

834
01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:34.375
<i>Not all of them are good memories.</i>

835
01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:41.174
<i>But part of me always felt
that maybe by doing this.</i>

836
01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:44.886
by cooking.
maybe you're rewriting your story.

837
01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:54.479
Wolfgang didn't start out because he knew
one day he would have a food company.

838
01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:58.316
and a TV show.
and restaurants around the world.

839
01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:03.279
NANCY: <i>He started out
because he loved to cook.</i>

840
01:03:04.071 --> 01:03:06.449
<i>and this was his life and his passion.</i>

841
01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:17.168
(Christina in German)

842
01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:38.356
(in English)
WOLFGANG: <i>I spent my whole life</i>

843
01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:39.982
<i>hating my stepfather.</i>

844
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.527
<i>and trying to prove him wrong.</i>

845
01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:49.033
But looking back. sometimes. I think.

846
01:03:49.116 --> 01:03:52.203
maybe that whole thing made me stronger.

847
01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:58.584
<i>I realized all this time.</i>

848
01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.587
<i>I wasn't running away from anything.</i>

849
01:04:04.215 --> 01:04:08.010
<i>I was going after the thing I love to do.</i>

850
01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:26.821
(fire crackles)

851
01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:43.796
WOLFGANG: <i>We all make mistakes
when we go through life.</i>

852
01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:49.260
<i>Looking back and say.
"I should have. I could have".</i>

853
01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.053
<i>that's not gonna get me anywhere.</i>

854
01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:59.145
I just think if you spend the time
talking about the past.

855
01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:01.522
you forget to talk about the future.

856
01:05:01.606 --> 01:05:04.775
what are the possibilities.
what can we do next?

857
01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:13.034
<i>So. when I moved Spago
from West Hollywood to Beverly Hills.</i>

858
01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:16.704
<i>I said. "What are we gonna do different?
I have to do something different."</i>

859
01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:21.334
<i>When I was at Ma Maison.
we made modern French food.</i>

860
01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:25.796
<i>I opened Spago.
was like a mixture of California.</i>

861
01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:28.132
<i>Then Chinois was Asian.</i>

862
01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:34.513
<i>But Austria.
it's where I fell in love with cooking.</i>

863
01:05:35.139 --> 01:05:39.226
And yet.
I never cooked Austrian food actually.

864
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:43.022
I said. "You know what? I'm gonna
put something Austrian on the menu."

865
01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:46.067
(lively music)

866
01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:54.200
WOLFGANG: <i>For me as a child.</i>

867
01:05:54.283 --> 01:05:57.119
<i>I remember the wiener schnitzel
my mother used to make.</i>

868
01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:02.041
<i>I remember she made a soup
with liver dumplings that I used to love</i>

869
01:06:03.084 --> 01:06:06.671
<i>or the palatschinken. or kaiserschmarrn.</i>

870
01:06:08.756 --> 01:06:13.844
These were things I remember
the most about our family.

871
01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:15.930
the positive part of our family.

872
01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:23.104
RUTH: <i>You know. we all have the taste
of our childhood in our heads.</i>

873
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:27.858
<i>And when he made the menu
at Spago Beverly Hills.</i>

874
01:06:27.942 --> 01:06:31.028
<i>it's like I'm gonna put my dish on there.</i>

875
01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:35.282
and I don't care if it even goes
with the rest of the Spago menu.

876
01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:36.617
I'm gonna put it on there.

877
01:06:39.161 --> 01:06:44.208
And of course. we all order it
all the time because it's fantastic.

878
01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:47.503
(lively music)

879
01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:05.688
Wolfgang does so many things.

880
01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:09.233
NANCY: <i>But I always knew that
he was never more comfortable</i>

881
01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:12.987
<i>than in his chef jacket.
in front of a stove.</i>

882
01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:16.574
That's when Wolfgang feels like Wolfgang.

883
01:07:20.077 --> 01:07:25.082
I think Wolfgang's greatest impact
is the joy that he brings to cooking.

884
01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:33.883
MICHAEL: <i>There's a warmth wherever he is.</i>

885
01:07:33.966 --> 01:07:37.762
He just generates it.
He walks into a room and it lights up.

886
01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:45.978
People say food is medicine.
For Wolf. food is the conduit of love.

887
01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:55.154
WOLFGANG: <i>To my big surprise.
wiener schnitzel was a huge success.</i>

888
01:07:55.237 --> 01:07:56.238
Everybody loved it.

889
01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:04.371
<i>In a way. it reminded me.
that for me. food is family.</i>

890
01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:09.835
Making people feel happy
is my purpose in life.

891
01:08:29.105 --> 01:08:32.274
WOLFGANG: I think. it's interesting.
you know. how we live our life.

892
01:08:32.858 --> 01:08:36.028
We forget how short
it is actually. you know?

893
01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:44.745
So. I think. now I'm a little bit
more stingy with my time.

894
01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:52.002
CREW:

895
01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:56.048
Oh. because I only have
that many summers left. really.

896
01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:12.940
How we do. all right?

897
01:09:13.023 --> 01:09:16.861
-CHEF 3: Great. chef. Yes. chef.
-What we having. bread?

898
01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:19.405
-CHEF 4: Bread. brioche.
-Brioche.

899
01:09:20.072 --> 01:09:21.699
-CHEF 5: Hi. chef!
-What are we making?

900
01:09:21.782 --> 01:09:23.784
We're making chocolate.
jumbo chocolate chip cookies.

901
01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.495
-But make them really dark. huh?
-Yes. chef.

902
01:09:26.579 --> 01:09:29.832
-No white. no more white cookies.
-No white cookies.

903
01:09:29.915 --> 01:09:30.958
Yeah.

904
01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:33.502
WOLFGANG: <i>When people ask me
what I'm the most proud of.</i>

905
01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.671
it's really longevity.

906
01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.757
How's the tuna? Get me a little of that.

907
01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:43.304
WOLFGANG:
<i>Staying in business for so many years.</i>

908
01:09:43.387 --> 01:09:45.931
<i>it really takes a lot of hard work.</i>

909
01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.850
-Don't go when cooking. okay?
-Yes. chef.

910
01:09:48.726 --> 01:09:52.104
WOLFGANG: <i>I think. we always
have to continue to change.</i>

911
01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:59.361
And I really believe we get new ideas
often from the younger ones.

912
01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:01.864
(Wolfgang mumbles)

913
01:10:03.824 --> 01:10:07.203
WOLFGANG: <i>Now. I have the pleasure
and the luxury</i>

914
01:10:07.286 --> 01:10:09.538
<i>to have so many talented young chefs.</i>

915
01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:11.874
like my son. Byron.

916
01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:15.419
-What. are you gonna put the egg in there?
-Yeah.

917
01:10:15.502 --> 01:10:17.087
-Let's do that.
-Okay here. I'll help you.

918
01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:18.047
Thank you.

919
01:10:19.173 --> 01:10:22.301
-Hopefully. I don't put the shells in.
-Nailed it.

920
01:10:23.844 --> 01:10:27.890
BYRON: <i>I stared working at Spago
as a 13-year-old. peeling potatoes.</i>

921
01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:34.355
And seeing him there as the kind of leader
was just amazing for me to watch as a kid.

922
01:10:38.984 --> 01:10:41.195
<i>Everything he did. I wanted to do it.</i>

923
01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.865
I felt very comfortable
in this environment.

924
01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:47.076
and it felt like something I could really.

925
01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:50.663
really put my heart into.
and spend the rest of my life doing.

926
01:10:50.746 --> 01:10:52.748
(sizzles)

927
01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:57.628
-A little more.
-Okay. yeah. make it nice and crispy.

928
01:10:57.711 --> 01:10:58.712
Yeah.

929
01:11:00.547 --> 01:11:03.592
BYRON: <i>Now. I get to be passionate
not only about the same thing.</i>

930
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:08.138
but I get to have one of the best teachers
in the world helping me along the way.

931
01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:11.392
That remind me that sound
that my mother used to make.

932
01:11:11.475 --> 01:11:12.559
Yeah.
(chuckles)

933
01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:18.440
RUTH: <i>The fact that Byron really wants
to be in the business.</i>

934
01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:21.944
I don't think there could be
greater joy for Wolf than that.

935
01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:26.282
I mean. to have a son
who wants to follow in his footsteps.

936
01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:27.616
I think. it's huge for him.

937
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.828
-Folks. we enjoying ourselves over here?
-CUSTOMER: We are.

938
01:11:30.911 --> 01:11:31.954
Doing well?

939
01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:41.213
As a younger chef. I think.
I was so absorbed in my profession.

940
01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:48.429
of becoming successful
that I neglected my duty as a father.

941
01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:55.519
WOLFGANG: <i>But now. it's a great thing
to work with my son in the business.</i>

942
01:11:56.353 --> 01:12:00.941
And I think for a father. there's nothing
better than seeing your kids successful.

943
01:12:06.196 --> 01:12:10.367
-GELILA: No. seriously.
-Put down the cutting board right there.

944
01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:14.455
Who wants to be sous-chef.
because I hate cutting onions. seriously.

945
01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:15.664
Okay. I do.

946
01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:19.001
-That is the best use of Wolfgang Puck.
-Okay.

947
01:12:19.084 --> 01:12:21.628
-Exactly. Cut two onions.
-Okay.

948
01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:23.505
Look at that.
I'm the chopper of the onions.

949
01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.507
ALEXANDER:
I actually think I should be the one.

950
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:29.094
Okay. you're going to start it
with the tip on the board like that.

951
01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.263
And push through so it
makes it really easy.

952
01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.973
-OLIVER: <i>Si. señor.</i>
-Yeah.

953
01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:34.391
-(laughing)
-BYRON: Here. use this.

954
01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:35.768
But it kinda tastes good. though.

955
01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:37.978
WOLFGANG: <i>When I look back today</i>

956
01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:41.106
<i>and ask what could I have done different?</i>

957
01:12:41.398 --> 01:12:44.651
<i>For sure it was spend
more time with the family.</i>

958
01:12:44.735 --> 01:12:46.945
I really missed my kids growing up.

959
01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:48.655
BYRON:
Uh. well. you have to go on Sundays.

960
01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:50.199
-Thankfully. I've never...
-(Alexander groans)

961
01:12:50.282 --> 01:12:52.159
-It is good.
-GELILA: I still need a lot.

962
01:12:52.242 --> 01:12:54.787
-That's fine. That's fine.
-No. don't take my cheese. Hey.

963
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:59.208
WOLFGANG: <i>But I'm now married to Gelila.
and we have two young boys.</i>

964
01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:02.753
So. now. I know how precious time is.

965
01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:05.506
-No kisses.
-(laughs)

966
01:13:08.008 --> 01:13:09.676
BYRON: Y'all ready to eat?

967
01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.221
(both laugh)

968
01:13:12.304 --> 01:13:14.098
-GELILA: Here's to my boys.
-Cheers.

969
01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:15.974
All right. good job. Byron.

970
01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.560
-Cheers. sir.
-Cheers.

971
01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:23.273
GELILA: <i>At the end of the day.
you have to live by an example.</i>

972
01:13:24.441 --> 01:13:28.278
Wolf's experience pushed him towards love.

973
01:13:29.363 --> 01:13:34.993
<i>to reconnect as a family
and become the person he wants to become.</i>

974
01:13:37.996 --> 01:13:42.209
That he's able to influence
not only his children.

975
01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:47.840
but also anyone who is able
to overcome challenges.

976
01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.385
<i>I think. that's a beautiful story.</i>

977
01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:57.057
(light music)

978
01:14:02.062 --> 01:14:06.525
BYRON: <i>I don't think there's better
examples of truly coming from nothing.</i>

979
01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:11.113
and building something incredible
than Wolfgang Puck.

980
01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:22.249
I think. the real moral of Wolf's story
is believe in yourself.

981
01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:28.589
Know what you're good at.
take chances and you can be a success.

982
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:38.098
RUTH: <i>Today.
there are hundreds of thousands.</i>

983
01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.642
<i>if not millions of people
who work in kitchens.</i>

984
01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:46.064
who aspire to be Wolfgang Puck
and who will take heart from his story.

985
01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:48.775
(all cheer)

986
01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:53.113
The most important lesson I learned
from Wolfgang is not to be afraid.

987
01:14:54.531 --> 01:15:01.205
His dedication. willingness to sacrifice
is what made him what he is.

988
01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:05.667
-We've gotta lean forward. it's very hot.
-The knife is...

989
01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:07.419
(laughs)

990
01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:09.213
Hot.

991
01:15:11.965 --> 01:15:16.136
BARBARA: <i>I think. Wolf's legacy
is in and of itself love.</i>

992
01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:20.641
<i>If you lead with your heart and your mind.</i>

993
01:15:20.724 --> 01:15:23.519
<i>and if you love what you do...</i>

994
01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:26.688
that's a life well lived.

995
01:15:34.112 --> 01:15:37.783
WOLFGANG: <i>I really believe
we have to have purpose in life.</i>

996
01:15:40.452 --> 01:15:45.457
<i>Nothing comes easy.
but if you believe in something.</i>

997
01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.918
<i>you have to follow your dreams.</i>

998
01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:59.304
<i>I hope I will end up doing the thing
I love to do</i>

999
01:16:00.931 --> 01:16:03.100
<i>until I take my last breath.</i>

1000
01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:13.151
(closing theme music)
