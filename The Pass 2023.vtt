That's the new scheme these men
are running nowadays.

Baptiste.

161
00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:47.764
Here is my baby.

162
00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:48.390
Hey baby.

163
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.391
Looking scrumptious.

164
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.684
Hello?

165
00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.518
I'm being cordial.

166
00:05:51.976 --> 00:05:55.063
You don't just walk in without
speaking.

167
00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.439
This is still my house.

168
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:56.898
Ah. yeah.

169
00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.527
No. no. you're right.

170
00:06:00.568 --> 00:06:01.027
You're right.

171
00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:02.529
This is still your house.

172
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.238
And I will never be able
to pay her back

173
00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:05.490
because she wants to make sure

174
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:05.907
that I stay out of work.

175
00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.453
You took me off the Pryor mansio

176
00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:11.037
didn't you?

177
00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:13.498
Ma. why?

178
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.915
Why would you do that?

179
00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:15.250
Look. son in law.

180
00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.669
when I referred you to Kevin.

181
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:18.795
I had no idea that he would give

182
00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:22.007
you such a big client
right off the bat.

183
00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:24.634
I mean. you
just got your license. right?

184
00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:26.428
Which I paid for.

185
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.013
There we go.

186
00:06:28.596 --> 00:06:29.347
All I'm saying

187
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.306
is. I know this business.

188
00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.809
and you're in over your head
here.

189
00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.687
The client
was on the hook right?

190
00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.108
He didn't
even verify funds. dear.

191
00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:42.193
Now. that's real estate 101.

192
00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:42.694
Come on.

193
00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.904
Any good consultant

194
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:45.238
would know that.

195
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.657
Well. I checked his account.

196
00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.200
and it's a cash transaction.

197
00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:49.951
so cash is king.

198
00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.204
Actually.

199
00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.831
you checked their account.

200
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.957
Because his wife.

201
00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.169
his ex-wife. as of yesterday.

202
00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:01.254
has frozen his accounts.

203
00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:03.048
And if you were doing your job.

204
00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:05.467
you'd know all that.

205
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:08.678
So I'm

206
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.680
just thinking it's best
to start off small.

207
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.683
Mom. he's more than capable.

208
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:16.478
Yeah. I was on it Etta.

209
00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:17.312
Okay.

210
00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:17.771
Listen...

211
00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:20.482
Sell some small houses in

212
00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:22.400
Stone Mountain first.

213
00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:23.693
And then work your way

214
00:07:23.735 --> 00:07:25.612
up to the million dollar
listings.

215
00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:27.238
That's what you do with that.

216
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.031
Check out this chili

217
00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:28.782
before I get out of here.

218
00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.825
You hungry. hmm?

219
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:34.662
hmm. Okay.

220
00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.290
now the chili is divine.

221
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.125
Oh. I got to get out
of here babe.

222
00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.085
Let me grab my stuff.

223
00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.713
I love you.

224
00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.632
And...

225
00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.258
Love you. too.

226
00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:52.180
Look.

227
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.056
Look. I know

228
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.265
Kevin can probably get you
a new listing just like that.

229
00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:58.687
And if you start
smaller than...

230
00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.105
Why do you let her control

231
00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.314
everything?

232
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.524
I'm just saying.

233
00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:02.857
I mean. maybe she's right.

234
00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:05.777
I am sick of this shit.

235
00:08:06.194 --> 00:08:07.195
I checked into it.

236
00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:08.571
He has an offshore account

237
00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.532
and his wife
doesn't know anything about.

238
00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.992
Oh. baby. I didn't know.

239
00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.619
Oh. I'm sorry.

240
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.328
Look. I'm sorry.

241
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.287
I didn't know.

242
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:17.664
Baby. I.

243
00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.499
It is supposed to be me

244
00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:21.543
and you against the world.

245
00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:23.044
Not me.

246
00:08:23.086 --> 00:08:24.045
You and your mama.

247
00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:25.171
You know.

248
00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:26.881
she doesn't have
anyone it|s just me.

249
00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:28.508
And I am so sorry.

250
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.093
I love you.

251
00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:33.179
And I support you 200%.

252
00:08:42.397 --> 00:08:43.189
Oh. perfect.

I'm so glad you're here.

258
00:08:52.574 --> 00:08:52.907
Are you ready for this?

259
00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:55.618
Please take this down

260
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.870
for her to read that.

261
00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:58.580
Just wait for it.

262
00:08:58.621 --> 00:08:59.831
I need you to read this out

263
00:08:59.873 --> 00:09:02.000
loud to everyone in the room.

264
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.251
Okay.

265
00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:09.841
Congratulations to the firm

267
00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.095
We would like to invite you

268
00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.597

269
00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.848

Congratulations. everyone.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.395

Jade's new restaurant

275
00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:28.068
Interior.

276
00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:28.735
All right.

277
00:09:29.903 --> 00:09:30.278
But that doesn't mean we don't
have a lot of work to do.

278
00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:31.738
So let's get back to it.

279
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.280

280
00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.574

Thank you.

283
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.209
Amazing. right?

284
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.585
Amazing.

285
00:09:45.627 --> 00:09:46.961
You know.
I really can't take the credit.

286
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:48.963
You did your thing.

287
00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.924
Oh. no.

288
00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.926
We are a great team.

289
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:54.260
Okay.

290
00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:55.929
We couldn't do it
without everybody.

291
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.013
Well. I mean. I did groom you.

292
00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.932
so I can take a little credit.

293
00:10:02.435 --> 00:10:02.811
But. you

294
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:04.270
know.
this is just the beginning.

295
00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:05.814
It's going to be long days.

296
00:10:07.524 --> 00:10:07.941
Grueling nights.

297
00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:11.403
I assure you. Maurice can handle

298
00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:11.820
that.

299
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:15.281
It'll be fine.

300
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.574
Yeah.

301
00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:17.784
We got this.

302
00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:18.785
I know you do.

303
00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:28.628
We are practically going

304
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.422
to be living in this
office. but.

305
00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:31.297
Yeah.

306
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:32.924
Congrats. girl.

307
00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:34.676
Girl.

308
00:10:35.719 --> 00:10:36.928
Oh my goodness.

309
00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.180
Let|s get to work.

310
00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.142
I see.

311
00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:44.769
I see you.

312
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:47.689
And that is how it|s done.

313
00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:48.732
okay.

314
00:10:48.773 --> 00:10:49.983
Tiger Hoods.

315
00:10:51.276 --> 00:10:54.070
Yo. what|s wrong bro?

316
00:10:54.946 --> 00:10:55.989
Looking like Charlie Brown

317
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:56.948
Just lost a big fucking client.

318
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.659
Nina's moms is trippin|.

319
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.036
Again!

320
00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:03.329
I can't make a move without her

321
00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:04.289
breathing down my neck.

322
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.957
Oh. you know. that lady's

323
00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.542
not a fan of yours.
right? I know.

324
00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:09.502
her crazy
ass probably got people

325
00:11:09.544 --> 00:11:11.254
watching you all over town

326
00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.547
just ready to catch you slippin|

327
00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.341
It|s too many big things
coming up.

328
00:11:14.382 --> 00:11:15.383
We've got the anniversary party.

329
00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:17.385
the mortgage. upgrading Nina's
ring.

330
00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:18.595
You do better
not worrying about all of that.

331
00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.597
She's already in.

332
00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.015
and she|s a trust fund baby.

333
00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.350
I think it's unnecessary.

334
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:24.642
if you ask me.

335
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:25.560
Happy wife. happy life. right?

336
00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.437
That's what they say. isn't it?

337
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:29.272
All right. so I got to keep her
on the level

338
00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:31.066
of where she used
to be in order for this to work.

339
00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.401
Yeah but seven years in dog.
Come on.

340
00:11:33.443 --> 00:11:35.403
How much more you got
to do for this shit to work?

341
00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.864
Yeah. he's on that

342
00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:38.406
Forever ever type of plan.

343
00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.034
And we ain't got forever.

344
00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:41.951
Right. exactly.

345
00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:43.745
And you got to stop paying
for that expensive shit.

346
00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:44.454
Yeah.

347
00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:45.997
Borrowing money from your boys.

348
00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:47.082
Right.

349
00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:49.000
Cause I ain't got
no more to give you. Jack.

350
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:50.919
Look. the Maurice that I know

351
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.130
would have been nip this shit.

352
00:11:54.673 --> 00:11:55.757
Wouldn't be playing
with Etta.

353
00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:56.925
Look. she throwing you off
your game bro

354
00:11:58.301 --> 00:11:59.761
with you and Nina.

355
00:12:00.679 --> 00:12:01.471
She throwing you
off your game. man.

356
00:12:02.097 --> 00:12:02.972
Got a point.

357
00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.099
So you trying to say I'm caught

358
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:05.433
like a wedgy.

359
00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.311
You know. it just seems like

360
00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.064
you're going down a path
that it's not worth it now.

361
00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:13.692
Look at him.

362
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:14.609
She got a buddy

363
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.235
wrapped around a little finger.

364
00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:17.278
You know.

365
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:22.075
Oh. shit.

366
00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:23.451
Okay. kind of smashed it.

367
00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:24.911
That was a nice shot.

368
00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.287
I don't
think I smashed. though.

369
00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.082
Hey. don't scroll to the left.

370
00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:31.084
Whoa!

371
00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:32.252
Yeah. Yeah.

372
00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:34.421
Damn nigga that|s you?

373
00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:37.048
Give me my phone back.

374
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.842
Yo Shay is gonna kill you.

375
00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:40.010
Shay is the one

376
00:12:40.051 --> 00:12:41.302
who told me to do this.

377
00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:42.554
What?

378
00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:42.971
My wife knows that

379
00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:46.099
the path to a man's heart

380
00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.018

Well. so you telling me

That's what you talking about.
A pass. right?

387
00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:00.155
Get the fuck out of here.

388
00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:02.490
She's gonna give me a pass
to do my thing

389
00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:02.949
for a while now.

390
00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:05.076

391
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:06.369

Okay. so

393
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:09.873

What kind of question is that?

396
00:13:17.172 --> 00:13:18.340
Nobody.

397
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:21.134
She's all mine.

398
00:13:21.176 --> 00:13:22.344
It don't work like that.

399
00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:23.845
It go both ways.

400
00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:25.347
Listen. Listen. On the real.

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:26.514

Ayo. don't be calling

So. so sorry.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:32.270
But that's why I'm single.

Look. you be thinking that

407
00:13:33.772 --> 00:13:34.898

but right now.

409
00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:38.943

So many boys out

495
00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.807
And we started talking
about relationships.

496
00:16:56.891 --> 00:16:58.143
And of course. ours

497
00:16:58.184 --> 00:16:59.394
is the best relationship.

498
00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:00.270
Mm hmm.

499
00:17:00.603 --> 00:17:00.937
Relationship goals.

500
00:17:00.979 --> 00:17:01.855
Facts.

501
00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:03.106
But I do love Shay
Deon|s love.

502
00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:04.607
I really love their love.

503
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:05.734
Okay.

504
00:17:06.276 --> 00:17:07.736
Okay. Well. speaking of that.

505
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:10.613
Deon
brought up this thing about

506
00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.409
him and Shay having a pass.

507
00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:16.619
Do you know what a pass is?

508
00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:19.080
You mean. like.

509
00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:20.081
Like a hall pass?

510
00:17:20.123 --> 00:17:20.665
Yes. Oh. yes.

511
00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.084
Apparently.

512
00:17:23.126 --> 00:17:24.085
Deon and Shay have done it

513
00:17:24.127 --> 00:17:26.671
a couple of times.

514
00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:30.216
Wow.

515
00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:31.468
And what do you think
about that?

516
00:17:34.763 --> 00:17:36.765
You mean like having sex

517
00:17:36.806 --> 00:17:37.766
with other people?

518
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.477
I don't.

519
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:41.519
But you do know

520
00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:42.395
Shay and Deon are crazy.

521
00:17:42.437 --> 00:17:43.271
Yes.

522
00:17:43.605 --> 00:17:44.898
I mean. so.

523
00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:46.316
But you did just say that

524
00:17:46.358 --> 00:17:47.776
you love their love.

525
00:17:48.109 --> 00:17:49.444
Right.

526
00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:51.780
And a pass doesn't mean

527
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.615
there's anything bad

528
00:17:53.656 --> 00:17:54.699
in our marriage.

529
00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.117
Just.

530
00:17:56.368 --> 00:17:58.828
I just found it

531
00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:00.538
interesting.

532
00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:00.622
Hmm.

533
00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:03.667
Interesting?

534
00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:04.042
Mm hmm.

535
00:18:04.751 --> 00:18:05.835
Or do you mean you're
interested?

536
00:18:05.877 --> 00:18:08.129
Oh. no. no. no.

537
00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:10.173
Big no.

538
00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:12.592
I mean.

539
00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:13.677
unless you're interested.

540
00:18:19.057 --> 00:18:21.976
“Phone vibrating”

541
00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:24.562
Oh. This is my mom calling. Oh.

542
00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:27.190

No. no. no. no. I can just.

545
00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:30.735
No. go ahead.

546
00:18:30.985 --> 00:18:31.945
That's fine.

547
00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:33.113
Look. answer the phone

548
00:18:33.154 --> 00:18:33.780
before she pulls up
to the front door.

549
00:18:33.822 --> 00:18:34.155
like she always does.

550
00:18:34.781 --> 00:18:35.115
you know.
she will do that.

551
00:18:35.156 --> 00:18:36.116
Right.

552
00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:36.658
Okay.

553
00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:37.158

554
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.576
Okay.

Oh. here she is.

00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.379
What|s up!

560
00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:52.173
I wanted the first hug.

561
00:18:53.091 --> 00:18:55.719
Oh. thank you.

562
00:18:56.678 --> 00:18:57.262
Okay. So

571
00:19:08.148 --> 00:19:09.649
What? I think?

572
00:19:09.691 --> 00:19:10.483
Oh. just expense it.

573
00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:11.735
We'll call it a company dinner

00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:15.739
Love you guys.

575
00:19:16.448 --> 00:19:17.949
You know. I don't know why
I ever doubted myself.

576
00:19:18.408 --> 00:19:19.826

Drinks!

592
00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.181
I like my drink
like I like my men's.

593
00:19:41.473 --> 00:19:42.891
And sometimes my women

594
00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:45.727
Bottomless!

595
00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:49.689

mimosas. please?

596
00:19:49.731 --> 00:19:51.399

597
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:52.609

Sure thing.

601
00:19:59.115 --> 00:19:59.866
Okay.

602
00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:01.785
I see somebody is in a good mood
today.

603
00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.286
Could it be because of your

604
00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:05.705
pass?

605
00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:06.748
What pass?

606
00:20:09.084 --> 00:20:11.586
Deon and I tried to pass.

607
00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:12.629
Oh. so you

608
00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.255
bringing on another partner?

609
00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:15.215
Okay. girl.

610
00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.300
Good for you.

611
00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:19.427
I must be rubbing off on you.

612
00:20:20.178 --> 00:20:20.804
I don't see how you do it.

613
00:20:20.845 --> 00:20:22.263
How do you do that?

614
00:20:22.305 --> 00:20:23.181
Oh. you know.

615
00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.558
I guess to go out and play
and I get him out

616
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.768
of my face for a few hours.

617
00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:28.645
To be honest with you.

618
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.647
I would rather know
if he's going to go

619
00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:33.066
do something.
you know. like. I'd rather

620
00:20:33.108 --> 00:20:34.275
know about it.

621
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:36.403
Okay.

622
00:20:36.444 --> 00:20:37.237
Okay. Shay.

623
00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:39.531
So what exactly are you doing

624
00:20:39.572 --> 00:20:40.657
while Deon is out playing?

625
00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:46.204
Well. I might.

626
00:20:46.246 --> 00:20:47.622
Let the neighbor.

627
00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:50.041
Oh. girl.

628
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.919
Well let|s just say

629
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:53.962
he had a taste of Shay
on his lips?

630
00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:56.089
But. that was it.

631
00:20:56.131 --> 00:20:57.257
That was it.

632
00:20:57.298 --> 00:20:58.591
Nothing else. It was just that.

633
00:20:58.633 --> 00:20:59.926
You could tell me later.

634
00:20:59.968 --> 00:21:02.637
How did you know about the pass.
anyway?

635
00:21:04.806 --> 00:21:06.808
Did Deon|s big head ass
tell you about it?

636
00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:09.853
Yes. His big ass head
told my husband.

637
00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:11.521
And last night at dinner.

638
00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:12.147
all I kept hearing about was
the pass this the pass that.

639
00:21:12.188 --> 00:21:13.148
And you know what?

640
00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:15.316
I blame you.

641
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.277
Okay. well.

642
00:21:17.318 --> 00:21:19.821
now that you know about it.

643
00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:21.322
What do you think?

644
00:21:21.364 --> 00:21:22.824
Are you ready
to come to the dark side?

645
00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.285
Oh. Oh. no. no.

646
00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.871
I am not like you guys.

647
00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.539
Okay. Ya|ll are some swingers.

648
00:21:29.873 --> 00:21:31.416
Nina listen.

649
00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:33.793
boring ass missionary

650
00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:34.002
is just fine.

651
00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:35.712
I like that. actually.

652
00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:38.965
I mean. Maurice

653
00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:40.967
is just expressing to you

654
00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:41.468
his fantasies.

655
00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:43.219
Communication

656
00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:44.137
is a good thing
in marriage. right?

657
00:21:44.179 --> 00:21:44.888
That's true.

658
00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:47.182
But it's all about
the vibrational energy.

659
00:21:47.223 --> 00:21:48.975
Reading about it.

660
00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:50.185
Come on. stop with that damn

661
00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:51.978
vibrational energy bullshit.

662
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:53.313
All right. Tell truth

663
00:21:53.355 --> 00:21:54.105
When is the last time
you gave him some?

664
00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:57.817
it has been some weeks.

665
00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:00.195
I mean. you know. it's

666
00:22:00.236 --> 00:22:01.821
just been a lot between work

667
00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:03.156
and my mom
and just all the drama.

668
00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:05.450
I am drained.

669
00:22:05.784 --> 00:22:06.034
You know what

670
00:22:06.618 --> 00:22:07.285
It sounds like you were just

671
00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:08.870
not in sync right now.

672
00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:11.247
I mean.
you need to get in alignment.

673
00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:12.082
You know. be aligned.

674
00:22:12.123 --> 00:22:12.874
It|s probably that retrograde.

675
00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:15.001
Isn't that what we're
in right now?

676
00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:15.877
Okay. Come on. now.

677
00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:17.045
I can't fault the poor

678
00:22:17.087 --> 00:22:18.296
girl for working hard. okay?

679
00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:19.381
We had a lot of work to do.

680
00:22:19.422 --> 00:22:20.048
We did?

681
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.966
Okay.
You just align them checks.

682
00:22:22.342 --> 00:22:23.426
Thank you.

683
00:22:24.219 --> 00:22:25.220
He's just horny.

684
00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:27.263
That's all it is.
All of them are.

685
00:22:27.305 --> 00:22:27.806
And that's why
he keeps bringing up the pass.

686
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.266
Listen Nina.

687
00:22:30.308 --> 00:22:31.685
He's been very good to you.

688
00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:32.852
Seven years.

689
00:22:32.894 --> 00:22:34.396
I don't see
what the big deal is.

690
00:22:34.437 --> 00:22:36.022
Just let him go ahead and dip

691
00:22:36.064 --> 00:22:38.066
his stick in another pool real q

692
00:22:38.358 --> 00:22:39.359
and then come back.

693
00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:39.984
So what?

694
00:22:40.026 --> 00:22:41.653
Oh. what?

695
00:22:42.237 --> 00:22:44.030
I mean...

696
00:22:44.072 --> 00:22:44.698
I hear what ya|ll saying?

697
00:22:44.739 --> 00:22:47.575
I just. I don't know.

698
00:22:48.076 --> 00:22:49.327
I guess I could

699
00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:50.745
I don't know. think about it.

700
00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:51.746
Oh. okay.

701
00:22:51.788 --> 00:22:53.456
Well.
if you think about it. L.A.

702
00:22:53.498 --> 00:22:54.749
might be
a different kind of trip.

703
00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:56.209
What do you mean?

704
00:22:56.251 --> 00:22:56.918
Terra.

705
00:22:57.335 --> 00:22:57.752
Nohing.

706
00:23:06.094 --> 00:23:07.387
“Audible weird sounds”

707
00:23:07.429 --> 00:23:13.101
Baby?

708
00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:18.982
Baby. is that you?

709
00:23:19.524 --> 00:23:21.401
No. it|s me dear.

710
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:23.069
You just can't do that.

711
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:24.070
You just can't use your key.

712
00:23:24.112 --> 00:23:24.779
Anytime you want.

713
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:26.072
Okay. Okay. calm down.

714
00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:26.781
Scared Me.

715
00:23:26.823 --> 00:23:27.782
I'm sorry.

716
00:23:27.824 --> 00:23:28.533
I just.

717
00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:30.076
I just came over to

718
00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:30.785
actually apologize for

719
00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:34.080
overstepping my boundaries.

720
00:23:35.331 --> 00:23:36.541
Oh. by

721
00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:38.626
overstepping another boundary.

722
00:23:40.003 --> 00:23:40.545
Your right.

723
00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:42.589
Here|s your key.

724
00:23:43.173 --> 00:23:44.174
so it won't happen again.

725
00:23:48.011 --> 00:23:49.012
I'm sorry.

726
00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:53.475
Apology reluctantly accepted.

727
00:23:54.809 --> 00:23:55.310
Okay.

728
00:23:55.352 --> 00:23:56.394
You know what?

729
00:23:56.436 --> 00:23:58.146
I'm happy
to apologize to him as well.

730
00:23:59.189 --> 00:24:01.608
So what time does he get home

731
00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:04.027
from doing nothing.

732
00:24:04.069 --> 00:24:04.652
See. there you go again.

733
00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:06.613
You just can't help
yourself. can you?

734
00:24:06.654 --> 00:24:09.240
You just can't not do it.

735
00:24:09.282 --> 00:24:10.450
I've asked you over and over.

736
00:24:10.492 --> 00:24:12.786
Please.
please stop putting Maurice down

737
00:24:12.827 --> 00:24:13.828
Listen to me. sweetheart.

738
00:24:14.454 --> 00:24:16.456
You have to understand that

739
00:24:16.498 --> 00:24:17.999
I just want the best for you.
okay?

740
00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:19.834
And he's not It.

741
00:24:20.543 --> 00:24:22.587
He is not the best. not him.

742
00:24:23.088 --> 00:24:24.047
not his friends.

743
00:24:24.089 --> 00:24:25.965
And definitely not that

744
00:24:26.299 --> 00:24:27.217
Terra woman.

745
00:24:28.051 --> 00:24:29.761
Okay. see. Terra. that is
a very good friend of mine.

746
00:24:29.803 --> 00:24:30.303
She's my best friend. actually.

747
00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:32.347
And she's a damn good boss.

748
00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:33.431
so please just leave her out of

749
00:24:33.682 --> 00:24:34.516
No. I will not.

750
00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:36.518
Because you are getting lost

751
00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:37.936
in these people.

752
00:24:38.228 --> 00:24:39.187
Don't you have your own friends.

753
00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:41.815
your your own identity?

754
00:24:41.856 --> 00:24:43.483
Your mom can just please stop.
okay?

755
00:24:43.525 --> 00:24:44.984
I don't have time for this.

756
00:24:45.026 --> 00:24:45.777
I have to pack.

757

I'm praying
that you step out on your own

774
00:25:16.891 --> 00:25:19.728
and you get all these
major contracts for yourself.

775
00:25:20.228 --> 00:25:23.565
Honey. you can open your own
design studio.

776
00:25:24.024 --> 00:25:25.692
Your father left
you enough money

777
00:25:25.734 --> 00:25:27.318
to be able to do that.

778
00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:28.695
Listen to me.

779
00:25:29.487 --> 00:25:32.741
Hey. I didn't raise a partner.

780
00:25:33.408 --> 00:25:34.117

781
00:25:34.743 --> 00:25:36.369
I raised you to be on top.
so please

782
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:37.912

783
00:25:37.954 --> 00:25:40.623
And honey. go for what you want.

784
00:25:44.252 --> 00:25:45.628
This is what I want.

785
00:25:50.467 --> 00:25:50.842
It's like you
don't understand.

786
00:25:55.388 --> 00:26:01.186
God. just please leave.

787
00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:02.604

00:26:02.645 --> 00:26:04.189
Listen to me.

789
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.648
Listen to me.

790
00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:09.110
You don't see me.

791
00:26:09.152 --> 00:26:09.694
You don't see me.

792
00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:11.154
And what I want.

00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:14.199
Now. can you hear me out

794
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.658
for just a moment?

795
00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:20.580
When your father

796
00:26:20.622 --> 00:26:21.956
and I built this house.

797
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.210
we did it
with a lot of sacrifices

798
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:27.295
and hard work

799
00:26:28.338 --> 00:26:30.340
and a whole lot of love.

800
00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:32.342
I just want to make sure

801
00:26:32.384 --> 00:26:34.219
that the same.

802
00:26:36.638 --> 00:26:38.264
the same love I was blessed with

803
00:26:39.891 --> 00:26:41.226
is experienced in these walls.

804
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:44.312
Okay?

805
00:26:44.979 --> 00:26:46.981
Sorry I love you so much.

806
00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.360

00:27:12.424 --> 00:27:13.633
Of course I did.

811
00:27:13.675 --> 00:27:14.300
I don't know why
you want to be here so early.

812
00:27:14.342 --> 00:27:16.386
Anybody here yet.

813
00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:19.347
Well.

814
00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:22.100
I wanted to finish up
our conversation.

815
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:23.226
What conversation?

816
00:27:26.438 --> 00:27:27.063
Well.

817
00:27:27.105 --> 00:27:27.522

Of course.

820
00:27:33.653 --> 00:27:35.613
I feel like you deserve

821
00:27:35.947 --> 00:27:37.824
a early anniversary
present.

822
00:27:38.199 --> 00:27:38.742

827
00:27:48.668 --> 00:27:50.003
I've been trying to tell you

828
00:27:50.045 --> 00:27:51.463

829
00:27:51.755 --> 00:27:53.465
Wow. Wow.

830
00:27:54.799 --> 00:27:57.469
I feel like you
deal with so much.

831
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.346
Between my mom and me

832
00:27:59.387 --> 00:27:59.888
working a lot.

833
00:28:02.015 --> 00:28:04.059
I just never want you
to feel unheard.

834
00:28:05.393 --> 00:28:06.478
And I just.

835
00:28:06.519 --> 00:28:07.812

836
00:28:07.854 --> 00:28:09.397

So what about. you?

843
00:28:23.578 --> 00:28:24.871

to be with another man.

844

So this is for you. baby.

00:32:46.758 --> 00:32:48.051

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:49.094
Yeah.

Hey. baby.

954
00:33:26.131 --> 00:33:30.218

to tell you. I love you.

00:33:56.745 --> 00:33:59.497
And I appreciate you so much.

959

00:34:07.172 --> 00:34:08.715
I'm just.

961
00:34:08.757 --> 00:34:09.799
I don't know.

962
00:34:10.759 --> 00:34:12.260
You do so much for me

963
00:34:13.053 --> 00:34:15.221
in my life and

964
00:34:16.348 --> 00:34:18.266
my career. All of this.

965
00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:20.769
My friends and

Just so grateful.

969
00:34:30.987 --> 00:34:31.738
It|s because

970
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.531
I love you.

971
00:34:33.573 --> 00:34:35.241
I love you too.

972
00:34:38.912 --> 00:34:40.121
Take your ass to sleep.

973
00:34:41.081 --> 00:34:45.710
Ladies and gentlemen.

974
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.212
this is your captain speaking.

975
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:49.589
Our flight time will be 5 hours

976
00:34:49.631 --> 00:34:49.756
and 24 minutes.

977
00:34:51.007 --> 00:34:52.384
Thank you.

978
00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:56.012
So. here is your key.

979
00:34:56.054 --> 00:34:57.222
Okay.

980
00:34:57.263 --> 00:34:58.932
And you can help yourself
to room service.

981
00:34:58.973 --> 00:35:00.433
minibar. whatever you like.

982
00:35:00.475 --> 00:35:03.478
Oh. I could get used to this.

983
00:35:04.104 --> 00:35:04.646
I thought you grew up rich.

984
00:35:05.313 --> 00:35:07.857
Well. it depends
what you define as rich.

985
00:35:07.899 --> 00:35:09.859
I still had to work.

986
00:35:15.657 --> 00:35:16.324
Okay.

987
00:35:17.492 --> 00:35:18.243
I really need you to keep
your head in the game. okay?

988
00:35:18.284 --> 00:35:19.786
Because I really want this

989
00:35:19.828 --> 00:35:20.954
for you. right?

990
00:35:21.413 --> 00:35:22.747
And we can talk about everything

991
00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:24.124
when we finalize the contract.
because you know what

992
00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:26.084
that means. right?

993
00:35:26.543 --> 00:35:27.669
You're going to
make me partner.

994
00:35:28.253 --> 00:35:28.628
Mmm hmmm.

995
00:35:31.006 --> 00:35:32.090
My head is in the game.

996
00:35:32.132 --> 00:35:33.299
Great.

997
00:35:33.675 --> 00:35:35.343
Let's do it.

998
00:35:38.138 --> 00:35:39.514
“Music”

00:35:42.183 --> 00:35:43.935
We want booty over here.

Get over here girl.

1002
00:35:50.525 --> 00:35:51.651

Well. you know. I missed you.

1005
00:35:55.822 --> 00:35:57.240
I missed you too.

1006
00:35:57.949 --> 00:35:58.533
How have you been?

1007
00:35:58.575 --> 00:35:59.659
I can't complain.

1008
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:03.580
What time you
getting off tonight?

1009
00:36:03.872 --> 00:36:04.831
I get off at three.

1010
00:36:05.874 --> 00:36:06.791
Why are you asking?

1011
00:36:07.917 --> 00:36:08.960
Maybe I'll come pick you up.

1012
00:36:10.754 --> 00:36:12.339
You're been a good boy
all this time.

1013
00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.882
Very faithful.

1014
00:36:14.132 --> 00:36:14.883
Mm hmm.

1015
00:36:15.675 --> 00:36:16.968
What's your wife going to say
about all this?

1016
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.011
Apparently. she said hello.

1017
00:36:18.053 --> 00:36:20.972
Ooh...

1018
00:36:25.018 --> 00:36:26.436
Thank you.

1019
00:36:28.021 --> 00:36:30.815
Oh. Oh. that's good.

1020
00:36:30.857 --> 00:36:31.900
Oh. my goodness.

1021
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.151
I just can't believe

1022
00:36:33.193 --> 00:36:36.488
I spent all day at
Lyrica|s house.

1023
00:36:37.238 --> 00:36:38.448
You know. like. that's amazing.

1024
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:39.866
She's so beautiful.

1025
00:36:39.908 --> 00:36:40.492
Oh. she's okay.

1026
00:36:40.533 --> 00:36:41.910
But she is loaded.

1027
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.038
and she does have other

1028
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.373
locations that she's helpful.
especially in France.

1029
00:36:46.748 --> 00:36:49.376
And that's
where I want us to be.

1030
00:36:49.417 --> 00:36:50.210
That's where I want to be.

1031
00:36:50.251 --> 00:36:52.962
That would be amazing!

1032
00:36:53.755 --> 00:36:55.674
Oh. my God. Wow.

1033
00:36:58.051 --> 00:36:59.678
Yeah. Oh!

1034
00:37:01.513 --> 00:37:02.931
What are you doing?

1035
00:37:03.431 --> 00:37:05.892
Oh. I mean. I'm

1036
00:37:05.934 --> 00:37:07.185
just texting Maurice.

1037
00:37:07.227 --> 00:37:07.894
You know. we.

1038
00:37:07.936 --> 00:37:09.562
No. he got his pass.

1039
00:37:09.604 --> 00:37:11.022
so I'm just checking on him.

1040
00:37:11.064 --> 00:37:12.232
And you have your pass.

1041
00:37:12.273 --> 00:37:13.775
So I need you to be here with me

1042
00:37:14.567 --> 00:37:17.862
now. and we are going to drink.

1043
00:37:17.904 --> 00:37:19.072
I'm missing my drinks
and we're refilling it.

1044
00:37:19.114 --> 00:37:21.241
Thank you so much.

1045
00:37:21.282 --> 00:37:22.909
Yeah. I just. I don't know.

1046
00:37:22.951 --> 00:37:23.952
I keep thinking about

1047
00:37:24.285 --> 00:37:25.412
that night at the restaurant.

1048
00:37:25.453 --> 00:37:27.414
That was pretty weird. right?

1049
00:37:28.331 --> 00:37:29.499
I mean. it was weird.
but you know what?

1050
00:37:29.541 --> 00:37:30.959
Weird shit happens every day.

1051
00:37:31.459 --> 00:37:33.044
I don't know. but.

1052
00:37:33.086 --> 00:37:33.586
Maurice came from Boston

1053
00:37:33.628 --> 00:37:35.213
before we met.

1054
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:37.340
so I could be something
with that.

1055
00:37:37.382 --> 00:37:39.926
Like.
should I be looking into it?

1056
00:37:39.968 --> 00:37:40.969
I mean...

1057
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:41.970
What you should be looking into

1058
00:37:42.303 --> 00:37:44.931
is being here right now

1059
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:46.641
and being present.

1060
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.601
Okay?

1061
00:37:48.643 --> 00:37:50.562
Besides. niggas look alike.

1062
00:37:51.146 --> 00:37:53.106
And niggas do nigga shit.

1063
00:37:53.148 --> 00:37:56.109

1064
00:37:56.151 --> 00:37:57.777
You need to be looking
at that nigga over there.

1065
00:37:58.236 --> 00:38:00.321
He|s looking at you.

1066
00:38:01.906 --> 00:38:03.116
No girl.
I think he's looking at you.

1067
00:38:03.408 --> 00:38:04.159
Do you think so?

1068
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:04.617
Let|s see.

1069
00:38:08.997 --> 00:38:10.290
What the hell are you doing?

1070
00:38:10.832 --> 00:38:13.335
I|m opening another
door for you. okay.

1071
00:38:13.835 --> 00:38:14.711
Oh. my God.

1072
00:38:15.128 --> 00:38:17.839
He|s coming.

1073
00:38:22.135 --> 00:38:23.511
Hello ladies.

1074
00:38:27.015 --> 00:38:28.183
Hey. Lexi.

Have you seen Entice?

1076
00:38:29.267 --> 00:38:31.561
Oh. I saw her earlier.

1077
00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:32.937

1083
00:38:41.029 --> 00:38:42.530
Yo. yo!

00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:43.990
Maurice. my man.

1085
00:38:44.032 --> 00:38:44.282
My guy.

1086
00:38:44.324 --> 00:38:45.408
Man.

It's just me. baby.

1090
00:38:50.705 --> 00:38:51.331
Every now and then
you got to fly solo.

1091
00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:52.749
I ain't mad at that.

1092
00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:54.084
So I heard

1093
00:38:54.959 --> 00:38:57.087
that you bout to sell this
mother fucker.

1094
00:38:57.754 --> 00:38:59.673
My wife wants. me to retire.

1095
00:38:59.714 --> 00:39:00.715
And can you believe that?

1096
00:39:02.759 --> 00:39:03.593
No. no. actually. I can't.

1097
00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.098
Like every other man

1098
00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:09.557
sometimes
you got to move on.

1099
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:11.309
Hey Big Jay.

1100
00:39:12.227 --> 00:39:13.812
Entice called she said
she can't make it tonight.

1101
00:39:14.312 --> 00:39:14.729
You know what?

1102
00:39:15.647 --> 00:39:16.898
I'm going to entice my foot
in her ass.

1103
00:39:18.525 --> 00:39:19.359
Well. she had some drama

1104
00:39:19.401 --> 00:39:22.696
with her daughter. I|m sorry.

1105
00:39:23.947 --> 00:39:24.656

Appreciate it.

1108
00:39:30.328 --> 00:39:31.913
Man that girl is a handful.

1109
00:39:31.955 --> 00:39:35.417
Yup. She sure is.
Both hands full.

1110
00:39:35.917 --> 00:39:37.168
“Laughing”

1111
00:39:46.302 --> 00:39:47.762
“Giggles”

1112
00:39:47.804 --> 00:39:48.930
Sorry.

1113
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.557
No problem.

1114
00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:51.641
So you were saying?

1115
00:39:51.683 --> 00:39:52.475
Yeah.

1116
00:39:52.517 --> 00:39:54.185
I mean. I don't know. It's...

1117
00:39:55.603 --> 00:39:57.230
I guess since my dad died.

1118
00:39:57.272 --> 00:39:59.065
It's just been my Mom.

1119
00:39:59.107 --> 00:40:01.067
She's just.

1120
00:40:02.527 --> 00:40:03.361
She just guilts me

1121
00:40:03.403 --> 00:40:04.863
about everything.

1122
00:40:05.572 --> 00:40:07.907
Like everything. right?

1123
00:40:08.783 --> 00:40:09.826
It's like

1124
00:40:10.452 --> 00:40:12.120
she wants to control me.

1125
00:40:13.496 --> 00:40:14.039
To feel needed

1126
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:14.456
I guess.

1127
00:40:14.497 --> 00:40:15.915
Na I...

1128
00:40:15.957 --> 00:40:16.750
I get it.

1129
00:40:17.584 --> 00:40:19.669
You know. my folks were
the same way. you know?

1130
00:40:19.711 --> 00:40:20.337
Always wanted me to know

1131
00:40:20.378 --> 00:40:22.213

1323
00:50:35.035 --> 00:50:35.535
Hey. girl.

00:50:36.953 --> 00:50:41.082
Hey. Hey.

00:50:42.917 --> 00:50:44.336
You have been working so hard.

1326
00:50:44.377 --> 00:50:45.545
You|ve been here
since 7:30 this morning.

1327
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.340
Yeah.

1328
00:50:48.715 --> 00:50:49.674
Go home.

1329
00:50:49.716 --> 00:50:50.216
I|m going.

1330
00:50:50.258 --> 00:50:50.550
It|s all good.

1331
00:50:52.719 --> 00:50:53.678
Let me help you.

1332
00:50:54.888 --> 00:50:56.097

1333
00:50:56.389 --> 00:50:58.767
Listen. you are doing amazing

1334
00:50:59.184 --> 00:51:00.518
I am so proud of you.

1335
00:51:01.436 --> 00:51:02.645
And I|m gonna talk to Terra

1336
00:51:02.687 --> 00:51:03.772
about giving you a raise

1337
00:51:04.773 --> 00:51:05.440
and a title.

1338
00:51:05.482 --> 00:51:06.900
And all that.

1339
00:51:06.941 --> 00:51:08.109
once. I become partner.

1340
00:51:08.735 --> 00:51:09.778
Your partner?

1341
00:51:10.445 --> 00:51:12.530
Shhh. It| not official yet.

1342
00:51:12.572 --> 00:51:12.614
But.

1343
00:51:15.033 --> 00:51:17.118
Oh. yeah.

1344
00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.787
I'm so happy for you.

1345
00:51:18.828 --> 00:51:21.581
Thank you. But.
I need you to get some rest.

1346
00:51:21.623 --> 00:51:22.165
Yeah.

1347
00:51:22.207 --> 00:51:23.500
Yes. yeah. yeah.

1348
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.002
Get well rested.

1349
00:51:26.336 --> 00:51:27.170
And you know what?

1350
00:51:27.462 --> 00:51:28.630
Come in late tomorrow.

1351
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.714
You sure?

1352
00:51:29.756 --> 00:51:30.298
Yes.

1353
00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:30.799
You deserve it.

1354
00:51:31.049 --> 00:51:32.884
You said it.

1355
00:51:32.926 --> 00:51:33.760
I'm not going to ask twice.

1356
00:51:33.802 --> 00:51:34.761
I did. I did.

1357
00:51:34.803 --> 00:51:36.763
So get home safe.

1358
00:51:36.805 --> 00:51:37.430
Okay.

1359
00:51:37.472 --> 00:51:39.474
And see you tomorrow.

1360
00:51:41.017 --> 00:51:41.601
I appreciate you.

1361
00:51:41.643 --> 00:51:43.019
I appreciate you.

1362
00:51:43.061 --> 00:51:44.479
You're doing great.

1363
00:52:12.257 --> 00:52:13.508
(Terra off screen)
Come on.

1364
00:52:17.178 --> 00:52:19.556
Oh. hey. come on in.

1365
00:52:27.355 --> 00:52:28.565
Been busy all day?

1366
00:52:28.857 --> 00:52:30.316
I haven't even been able

1367
00:52:30.358 --> 00:52:31.818
to talk to you.

1368
00:52:32.444 --> 00:52:32.819
Yeah.

1369
00:52:33.528 --> 00:52:34.738
I guess
it has been a very busy day.

1370
00:52:36.031 --> 00:52:37.032
You know. I was thinking

1371
00:52:37.365 --> 00:52:39.701
Alison has been doing
a great job.

1372
00:52:40.702 --> 00:52:41.036
Dedicated.

1373
00:52:41.077 --> 00:52:41.995
Loyal.

1374
00:52:42.037 --> 00:52:42.829
What do you think

1375
00:52:42.871 --> 00:52:44.664
maybe we should utilize her

1376
00:52:44.706 --> 00:52:45.707
skills more?

1377
00:52:47.375 --> 00:52:48.543
Yeah. Alison's great.

1378
00:52:48.877 --> 00:52:50.170
Yeah.

1379
00:52:50.211 --> 00:52:50.712
Yeah.

1380
00:52:51.087 --> 00:52:52.547
Under my grooming. of course.

1381
00:52:54.924 --> 00:52:56.509
No. that's a great idea.

1382
00:52:56.551 --> 00:52:56.718
Yeah.

1383
00:52:57.093 --> 00:52:57.886
I think so.

1384
00:53:05.935 --> 00:53:06.186
Sorry.

1385
00:53:06.728 --> 00:53:07.604
did you want something?

1386
00:53:12.275 --> 00:53:12.650
Well. I.

1387
00:53:15.362 --> 00:53:16.571
I was just going to say.

1388
00:53:18.782 --> 00:53:19.366
you know. and I said.

1389
00:53:19.407 --> 00:53:20.700
what happens in L.A.

1390
00:53:21.076 --> 00:53:22.285
doesn't leave L.A..

1391
00:53:22.619 --> 00:53:23.203
Oh. what happened in L.A.

1392
00:53:23.244 --> 00:53:25.330
Won't leave. L.A.

1393
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.248
Yeah.

1394
00:53:27.957 --> 00:53:28.958
I want to get my thought out.

1395
00:53:33.129 --> 00:53:37.300
Sigh... Yeah.

1396
00:53:37.592 --> 00:53:38.885
I haven't been able

1397
00:53:38.927 --> 00:53:40.470
to stop thinking about it.

1398
00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:42.347
There.

1399
00:53:42.806 --> 00:53:45.308
I said it. It's off my chest.

1400
00:53:47.018 --> 00:53:51.231
Sigh... But it

1401
00:53:51.272 --> 00:53:51.690
can't happen again

1402
00:53:53.149 --> 00:53:55.360
because. you know. you're.

1403
00:53:55.402 --> 00:53:56.403
You know. you're his friend.

1404
00:53:56.778 --> 00:53:59.322
and that just makes it
complicated

1405
00:53:59.364 --> 00:54:01.366
and overwhelming.
so don't worry.

1406
00:54:01.866 --> 00:54:02.951
okay?

1407
00:54:02.992 --> 00:54:03.493
Yeah. I got to worry about it.

1408
00:54:06.204 --> 00:54:07.956
That is. of course.

1409
00:54:07.997 --> 00:54:09.958
unless you want it

1410
00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:11.960
to happen again.

1411
00:54:17.048 --> 00:54:19.551
But we|re girls.

1412
00:54:21.011 --> 00:54:23.722
so it can't happen.

1413
00:54:30.228 --> 00:54:30.603
Yeah.

1414
00:54:35.483 --> 00:54:37.485
You know there's a spades
game tonight.

1415
00:54:38.361 --> 00:54:40.030
So if you want to come
to the house.

1416
00:54:40.864 --> 00:54:41.614
Oh. I'll be there.

1417
00:54:41.656 --> 00:54:42.490
With bells and whistles.

1418
00:54:42.532 --> 00:54:43.491
And. I'll bring the brown liquor

1419
00:54:46.244 --> 00:54:47.412
Brown liquor is good.

1420
00:54:47.746 --> 00:54:48.038
Great.

1421
00:54:48.079 --> 00:54:49.205
Yeah.

1422
00:54:49.247 --> 00:54:49.664
I'll see you there.

1423
00:54:59.924 --> 00:55:02.260
You don't get it.

1424
00:55:02.302 --> 00:55:04.471
It|s different
for men and women. all right?

1425
00:55:04.512 --> 00:55:06.139
It's just different
and thats facts.

1426
00:55:06.181 --> 00:55:07.140
That is ridiculous. Chris.

1427
00:55:07.182 --> 00:55:07.932
Would you just stop.

1428
00:55:07.974 --> 00:55:09.017
Hello? Hi.

00:55:09.642 --> 00:55:11.519
Yeah.
What are you talking about?

1430
00:55:11.561 --> 00:55:11.686
I don't even want to know.

1431
00:55:11.978 --> 00:55:13.438
Okay.

1432
00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.148
Oh. this is my favorite.

Okay. fix your energy.

Damn!

1457
00:55:53.436 --> 00:55:55.105
Stop playing with me. boy.

1458
00:55:56.398 --> 00:55:58.066
Talk to your man.

1459
00:55:59.275 --> 00:55:59.567
(Maurice off screen)
Eat your chips nigga!

1460
00:56:01.194 --> 00:56:02.612

No. no. no. no. no.

1462
00:56:03.697 --> 00:56:04.447
Hold up. hold up.

1463
00:56:04.489 --> 00:56:05.532
Because it's real talk time.

1464
00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.410
Because I had this little
conversation with my wife.

1465
00:56:09.411 --> 00:56:12.080
You know. you get a real
man's perspective.

1466
00:56:12.622 --> 00:56:14.374
She thinks it's okay

1467
00:56:14.916 --> 00:56:16.418
if a woman cheats on her husband

1468
00:56:16.459 --> 00:56:17.877
if the woman makes more money.

1469
00:56:18.086 --> 00:56:19.337
Oh. yeah.

1470
00:56:19.379 --> 00:56:21.506

World War III up in here.

00:56:22.298 --> 00:56:22.924
Oh no. we here.

1472
00:56:22.966 --> 00:56:24.384
listen. all I know

1473
00:56:24.426 --> 00:56:26.511
is that my woman would never

1474
00:56:26.928 --> 00:56:27.887
cheat on me.

1475
00:56:27.929 --> 00:56:28.555
Oh. really?

1476
00:56:28.805 --> 00:56:29.556
Hassan

1477
00:56:29.597 --> 00:56:30.598
You can't even keep a woman.

1478
00:56:31.224 --> 00:56:32.976
every time we see you.
you got a different one.

1479
00:56:33.018 --> 00:56:34.894
So you tell me
how you handling that.

1480
00:56:34.936 --> 00:56:35.687
Shots fired.

1481
00:56:38.189 --> 00:56:39.941
First of all. listen. as a man.

1482
00:56:40.316 --> 00:56:40.859
I like options.

1483
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:43.528
So quit hating.

1484
00:56:43.778 --> 00:56:44.195
Okay.

1485
00:56:44.237 --> 00:56:44.571
See women.

1486
00:56:46.281 --> 00:56:46.823
They can't separate

1487
00:56:46.865 --> 00:56:48.408
their feelings.

1488
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:49.993
Wait. Can't do what?

1489
00:56:50.035 --> 00:56:50.410
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1490
00:56:50.452 --> 00:56:51.453
My woman

1491
00:56:51.911 --> 00:56:53.121
would never have a problem
doing that.

1492
00:56:53.455 --> 00:56:54.622
Ain't that right. babe?

1493
00:56:56.458 --> 00:56:58.626
I|m going to get
the door.

1494
00:56:59.878 --> 00:57:01.212
Oh. okay.

1495
00:57:06.301 --> 00:57:08.553
“Distant chatter”

1496
00:57:09.179 --> 00:57:09.596
Sigh...

1497
00:57:15.977 --> 00:57:18.563
Hi!

1498
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:26.529
Can I come in?

1499
00:57:28.323 --> 00:57:29.866
Of course.

1500
00:57:30.575 --> 00:57:31.743
join the game.

1501
00:57:32.702 --> 00:57:33.953
I come bearing gifts.

1502
00:57:48.259 --> 00:57:49.719
Shay...

1503
00:57:50.762 --> 00:57:52.555
She make a couple more dollars
than me.

1504
00:57:52.597 --> 00:57:54.182
But. you know.

1505
00:57:54.224 --> 00:57:55.517
I'm still the man of the house

1506
00:57:55.558 --> 00:57:56.643
regardless.

1507
00:57:56.685 --> 00:57:58.395
Boy. I make way
more dollars than you.

1508
00:57:58.436 --> 00:57:59.729
so you better tell that bitch

1509
00:57:59.771 --> 00:58:01.314
to stop fucking calling me.

1510
00:58:01.356 --> 00:58:02.565
Which bitch.

1511
00:58:06.027 --> 00:58:07.153
Okay.

1512
00:58:08.238 --> 00:58:09.114
Oh. my goodness

1513
00:58:09.155 --> 00:58:09.864
Shay!

1514
00:58:09.906 --> 00:58:10.615
What the hell was that?

1515
00:58:10.657 --> 00:58:11.533
That was pretty intense.

1516
00:58:14.202 --> 00:58:14.911
You give a nigga a inch

1517
00:58:14.953 --> 00:58:16.287
he's gonna take a mile.

1518
00:58:16.788 --> 00:58:17.539
Can you believe

1519
00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.082
he let that bitch call me?

1520
00:58:19.833 --> 00:58:20.375
She said she didn't even know

1521
00:58:20.417 --> 00:58:22.293
he was married.

1522
00:58:22.335 --> 00:58:23.628
She was talking to me like I'm

1523
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:24.963
the fucking side-bitch?

1524
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:26.631
I bitch. what the fuck
you talking ‘bout.

1525
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:28.508
What's going on?

1526
00:58:28.758 --> 00:58:30.176
Cali. is this about the...

1527
00:58:30.218 --> 00:58:31.011
Yes. the pass.

1528
00:58:32.262 --> 00:58:33.013
I don't even know

1529
00:58:33.054 --> 00:58:33.888
what I'm going to do. y'all.

1530
00:58:35.098 --> 00:58:35.849
I cannot believe

1531
00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:38.560
he embarrassed me like this.

1532
00:58:38.935 --> 00:58:39.853
No. Shay.

1533
00:58:39.894 --> 00:58:41.646
Come on. Ain't no girl

1534
00:58:41.688 --> 00:58:42.856
worth all of this

1535
00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:47.485
You guys did set
the rules. right?

1536
00:58:47.527 --> 00:58:48.319
Because the rules are...

1537
00:58:48.361 --> 00:58:49.154
Rules don't even matter

1538
00:58:49.696 --> 00:58:51.281
when you got a new bitch
in your man face.

1539
00:58:51.823 --> 00:58:52.615
I mean. she's right.

1540
00:58:52.657 --> 00:58:54.325
That nigga did cross the line.

1541
00:58:55.744 --> 00:58:56.578
I can't even believe

1542
00:58:56.619 --> 00:58:58.204
I did that pass shit.

1543
00:58:59.372 --> 00:59:01.249
like that was so stupid.

1544
00:59:01.666 --> 00:59:03.335
Shay. I am sure that you and

1545
00:59:03.376 --> 00:59:04.586
Deon can work this out.

1546
00:59:05.086 --> 00:59:06.212
No girl is worth

1547
00:59:06.254 --> 00:59:08.173
you breaking up over.

1548
00:59:08.214 --> 00:59:08.840
Oh. hell no.

1549
00:59:08.882 --> 00:59:10.258
I'm not doing that.

1550
00:59:11.593 --> 00:59:12.802
I'm mad as hell!

1551
00:59:13.511 --> 00:59:14.596
Okay.
So what are you going to do?

1552
00:59:16.598 --> 00:59:17.766
You got a gun?

1553
00:59:18.433 --> 00:59:18.725
People do not let

1554
00:59:19.267 --> 00:59:20.226
people borrow guns. Shay.

1555
00:59:20.268 --> 00:59:21.061
But you got one right?

1556
00:59:24.522 --> 00:59:25.148
You good?

1557
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.982
No.

1558
00:59:26.691 --> 00:59:27.984
I don't I'm going to close
that deal with Big J

1559
00:59:28.026 --> 00:59:29.235
before the anniversary party.

1560
00:59:30.195 --> 00:59:31.821
And I still don't
got no fucking ring.

1561
00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:33.573
Don't worry about it.

1562
00:59:33.615 --> 00:59:34.866
What you mean. don't worry.

1563
00:59:34.908 --> 00:59:36.701
I mean. don't worry
because I got you.

1564
00:59:37.202 --> 00:59:37.619
like I always do.

1565
00:59:40.163 --> 00:59:40.372
Take over my cards.

1566
00:59:40.997 --> 00:59:43.124
Sure.

1567
00:59:45.627 --> 00:59:46.711
The boss is here.

1568
00:59:47.003 --> 00:59:47.921
you're trying to lose to.

1569
00:59:48.713 --> 00:59:49.381
I don't lose. baby.

1570
00:59:51.299 --> 00:59:51.633
Cali.

1571
00:59:52.258 --> 00:59:53.301
can you please go get your man?

1572
00:59:53.343 --> 00:59:54.260
He's not going to weird
shit again.

1573
00:59:54.302 --> 00:59:55.345
My God. Chris.

1574
00:59:55.387 --> 00:59:58.223
what are you talking about now?

1575
01:00:03.144 --> 01:00:05.105
You good?

1576
01:00:05.647 --> 01:00:06.147
Yeah.

1577
01:00:06.189 --> 01:00:08.066
of course.

1578
01:00:09.275 --> 01:00:10.110
I mean. go finish

1579
01:00:10.151 --> 01:00:11.111
taking these motherfuckers money

1580
01:00:31.339 --> 01:00:33.717
Ya|ll have a good night.

1581
01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.428
Aye Nina.

1582
01:00:36.469 --> 01:00:37.512
Yo

1583
01:00:37.554 --> 01:00:39.389
that potato salad was slamming?

1584
01:00:39.431 --> 01:00:41.516
Aww. thank you. you know
I do a little something.

1585
01:00:41.766 --> 01:00:42.308
Don't forget. I need that gun.

1586
01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:44.269
You be good now.

1587
01:00:44.561 --> 01:00:45.729
Shay. I|m not playing with you.

1588
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:47.689
All right. good night.

1589
01:00:58.408 --> 01:00:59.784
Babe.

1590
01:00:59.826 --> 01:01:00.744
Man. Terra be trippin|.

1591
01:01:01.202 --> 01:01:02.412
Did you know she slept
with that record

1592
01:01:02.454 --> 01:01:03.621
Exec about two years ago.

1593
01:01:03.663 --> 01:01:04.205
She might have helped you

1594
01:01:04.247 --> 01:01:05.999
get that deal in

1595
01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:07.417
more ways than one

1596
01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:11.713
What?

1597
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:16.676
Did you use your pass?

1598
01:01:16.718 --> 01:01:18.303
What?

1599
01:01:18.553 --> 01:01:20.347
No. I already told you.

1600
01:01:20.388 --> 01:01:21.556
No. hold on. hold on.

1601
01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:22.974
I thought we weren't supposed
to be asking any questions.

1602
01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:24.893
That's the rule.

1603
01:01:24.934 --> 01:01:26.394
No. you made that rule.

1604
01:01:27.062 --> 01:01:27.771
Okay.

1605
01:01:27.812 --> 01:01:28.980
What is wrong with you?

1606
01:01:29.397 --> 01:01:29.647
All right.

1607
01:01:30.273 --> 01:01:31.399
First of all. you never here.

1608
01:01:31.441 --> 01:01:32.317
And when you are here.

1609
01:01:32.359 --> 01:01:34.527
you acting like hell on wheels.

1610
01:01:34.569 --> 01:01:35.862
ever since
you came back from L.A..

1611
01:01:35.904 --> 01:01:36.738
Why do you keep saying that?

1612
01:01:37.697 --> 01:01:38.782
What does L.A. have to do
with it. Why do keep saying L.A.

1613
01:01:38.823 --> 01:01:40.200
You know. I'm
stressing out about work.

1614
01:01:40.241 --> 01:01:40.492
Okay?

1615
01:01:40.992 --> 01:01:41.409
You already know that.

1616
01:01:42.744 --> 01:01:43.870
Well. then why the hell are you
talking to me about the pass?

1617
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.789
First of all. yes. I had one.

1618
01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:46.706
No. I didn't use it.

1619
01:01:46.748 --> 01:01:47.415
So what the fuck is the problem?

1620
01:01:47.457 --> 01:01:49.292
Do you use your pass?

1621
01:01:49.334 --> 01:01:50.293
Don't put this on me.

1622
01:01:50.335 --> 01:01:51.461
Do not flip this on me.

1623
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.380
Okay? I already saw your phone.

1624
01:01:53.421 --> 01:01:55.715
And I saw a naked picture
of a bitch in your phone.

1625
01:01:55.757 --> 01:01:56.883
Yes. Yes. I did.

1626
01:01:56.925 --> 01:01:57.717
So that's what we're doing.

1627
01:01:58.259 --> 01:01:59.135
You having bitches
and you naked pictures.

1628
01:01:59.177 --> 01:01:59.844
Okay? Yes.

1629
01:02:00.387 --> 01:02:01.680
Some weird shit
coming through my phone.

1630
01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:02.263
Oh Wow.

1631
01:02:02.597 --> 01:02:02.764
But it's not somebody I know.

1632
01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.224
Okay.

1633
01:02:04.599 --> 01:02:05.475
I thought it must have been spam

1634
01:02:05.517 --> 01:02:06.309
or wrong number or some shit.

1635
01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:08.728
I blocked the number
every time I see.

1636
01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:09.562
You know you don't believe me.

1637
01:02:09.604 --> 01:02:10.355
Watch this.

1638
01:02:10.397 --> 01:02:11.189
Oh. no. I already saw it.

1639
01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:12.357
So I already saw the picture.

1640
01:02:12.607 --> 01:02:13.608
What are you trying...

1641
01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:14.943
I'm texting a bitch.
Check the phone.

1642
01:02:15.568 --> 01:02:19.155
I know what I saw.

1643
01:02:19.197 --> 01:02:23.076
You deleted the fucking picture.

1644
01:02:23.702 --> 01:02:24.202
Yes. you did.

1645
01:02:24.244 --> 01:02:24.452
I saw it

1646
01:02:26.579 --> 01:02:27.330
Don't play with me.

1647
01:02:27.372 --> 01:02:28.123
So you're just going to lie?

1648
01:02:28.164 --> 01:02:29.457
You're going to lie my face.

1649
01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:31.668
I|m not fucking lying.

1650
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:32.919
fuck you.

1651
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.257
What the fuck?

1652
01:02:38.633 --> 01:02:39.467
Great color.

1653
01:02:39.509 --> 01:02:40.552
Stick with that color.

1654
01:02:44.305 --> 01:02:44.514
Well hi.

1655
01:02:46.725 --> 01:02:47.684
What are you doing?

1656
01:02:48.184 --> 01:02:50.478
Looking for some inspiration.

1657
01:02:51.604 --> 01:02:52.480
You can. I think.

1658
01:02:52.522 --> 01:02:53.565
You doing pretty good?

1659
01:02:53.606 --> 01:02:54.983
Yeah.

1660
01:02:55.025 --> 01:02:55.817
Yes.

1661
01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:57.736
I like your earings.

1662
01:02:57.777 --> 01:02:57.944
Thank you.

1663
01:03:06.578 --> 01:03:07.495
Yeah.

1664
01:03:54.751 --> 01:04:02.384
“Moaning”

1665
01:04:20.402 --> 01:04:23.363
“Thud”

1666
01:04:47.178 --> 01:04:48.930
What is wrong with you?

1667
01:04:49.264 --> 01:04:50.974
Nothing.

1668
01:04:56.187 --> 01:04:57.981
Thought you said you
will make that work.

1669
01:04:58.690 --> 01:04:59.899
It|s working.

1670
01:04:59.941 --> 01:05:00.400
Fellas. fellas. fellas.

1671
01:05:00.442 --> 01:05:02.277
What|s up.

1672
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:04.654
Well. well. well.

1673
01:05:04.696 --> 01:05:05.822
Oh. yeah. yeah.

1674
01:05:05.864 --> 01:05:07.407
(Terra off screen)
Hello everyone!

1675
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:09.409
Hi. darling.

1676
01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:10.869
I brought Alison.

1677
01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:12.287
(Deon off screen)
It's nice to meet you.

1678
01:05:39.731 --> 01:05:41.316
There you are.

1679
01:05:41.358 --> 01:05:42.650
You look like you could use a dr

1680
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:45.236
Terra

1681
01:05:45.278 --> 01:05:46.529
Not right now. please.

1682
01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:48.573
What's wrong?

1683
01:05:49.908 --> 01:05:51.326
Nothing.

1684
01:05:52.369 --> 01:05:55.163
What does Alison want to drink?

1685
01:05:57.582 --> 01:05:58.792
Aww. you're jealous.

1686
01:05:59.167 --> 01:05:59.751
That|s so cute.

1687
01:05:59.793 --> 01:06:01.127
No please stop.

1688
01:06:01.169 --> 01:06:02.420
Can't do that.

1689
01:06:03.505 --> 01:06:03.755
Well. you tell me.

1690
01:06:04.297 --> 01:06:06.341
What do you want to do?

1691
01:06:08.802 --> 01:06:10.178
Nina?

1692
01:06:10.595 --> 01:06:11.513
Nina.

1693
01:06:14.015 --> 01:06:15.517
I know you saw what I saw.
right?

1694
01:06:16.518 --> 01:06:18.061
He's out here
hugging some other woman

1695
01:06:18.103 --> 01:06:19.312
at your anniversary party.

1696
01:06:19.354 --> 01:06:20.855
I can't do this right now.

1697
01:06:20.897 --> 01:06:22.148
You will do this right now. and
didn't want to tell you this.

1698
01:06:23.191 --> 01:06:24.693
but he's also been going
in and out of strip clubs.

1699
01:06:24.734 --> 01:06:27.237
I know this because I've had
our driver follow him. see.

1700
01:06:27.278 --> 01:06:30.198
Mom. I have guests right now.

1701
01:06:30.615 --> 01:06:31.408
I have guests.

1702
01:06:31.449 --> 01:06:32.075
I cannot keep them waiting.

1703
01:06:32.117 --> 01:06:33.952
And I cannot be rude.

1704
01:06:33.993 --> 01:06:34.869
No. not right now. mom.

1705
01:06:34.911 --> 01:06:37.163
I can't do this.
I have to go.

1706
01:07:26.755 --> 01:07:29.591
Just the man I was looking for

1707
01:07:30.425 --> 01:07:31.009
What's up?

1708
01:07:31.051 --> 01:07:32.093
What|s up?

1709
01:07:32.677 --> 01:07:36.389
Oh. what's up is bam.

1710
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:38.266

Thank you.

1715
01:07:47.984 --> 01:07:48.526
Now go do what you need to do.

1716
01:07:50.779 --> 01:07:51.780

Baby.

From the day that I met you.

1723
01:08:31.653 --> 01:08:32.445
I wanted to give you the world.

1724
01:08:35.115 --> 01:08:40.036
And this is just

1725
01:08:40.078 --> 01:08:40.453
a little piece of it.

1726
01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:47.085
Just me and you.

1727
01:08:47.127 --> 01:08:47.419
Against the world forever. baby.

1728

I love you.

1729
01:08:57.846 --> 01:08:59.889
Come on. now.

1730
01:09:00.432 --> 01:09:01.599
Okay.

1731
01:09:02.058 --> 01:09:02.809
Time to take off the old one.

1732
01:09:02.851 --> 01:09:04.686
Let|s swap it out.

1733
01:09:08.356 --> 01:09:12.444
Oh. oh. oh.

1734
01:09:14.446 --> 01:09:16.656
Oh my god.

1735
01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:19.576
Let me see.

1736
01:09:19.617 --> 01:09:20.827
Ooo it|s huge.

1737
01:09:20.869 --> 01:09:22.287
It is. It's really big.

1738
01:09:22.328 --> 01:09:23.496
Are we sure it|s real.

1739
01:09:23.538 --> 01:09:23.747
Ma.

1740
01:09:24.164 --> 01:09:25.999
Okay. I'm sorry.

1741
01:09:26.041 --> 01:09:27.334
It's beautiful. It's lovely.

1742
01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:27.834
And I'm happy for both of you.

1743
01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:30.170
And I'm going

1744
01:09:30.211 --> 01:09:31.463
to make an appointment

1745
01:09:31.504 --> 01:09:32.130
to get it appraised tomorrow.

1746
01:09:32.172 --> 01:09:34.257
Your Mama is shady as

1747
01:09:34.299 --> 01:09:35.633
hell. but I love it.
She|s hilarious.

1748
01:09:42.849 --> 01:09:44.184
Wow.

1749
01:09:44.225 --> 01:09:45.852
I did good?

1750
01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:47.020
Yeah.

1751
01:09:47.062 --> 01:09:49.230
Amazing?

1752
01:10:05.163 --> 01:10:06.706
All right. all right.

1753
01:10:06.748 --> 01:10:07.165
All right.

1754
01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:09.376
There he is.

1755
01:10:09.918 --> 01:10:11.961
The man of the hour.

1756
01:10:12.462 --> 01:10:14.255
The one. the only.

1757
01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:15.715
My best friend.

1758
01:10:15.757 --> 01:10:16.257
Hello. Best friend.

1759
01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:17.008
Hello.

1760
01:10:17.842 --> 01:10:18.843
Where's my cigar?

1761
01:10:21.179 --> 01:10:21.554
Now that you mentioned it.

1762
01:10:23.056 --> 01:10:23.431
Thank you.

1763
01:10:26.935 --> 01:10:28.269
Cheers.

1764
01:10:30.355 --> 01:10:31.564
That was beautiful.

1765
01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:34.484
It almost made me tear up.

1766
01:10:34.943 --> 01:10:36.319
Oh. thank you.

1767
01:10:37.153 --> 01:10:38.071
You know.

1768
01:10:38.113 --> 01:10:38.571
I couldn't have done it

1769
01:10:38.613 --> 01:10:39.906
without you.

1770
01:10:40.657 --> 01:10:41.658
I know.

1771
01:10:47.122 --> 01:10:47.497
She looks really happy.

1772
01:10:49.749 --> 01:10:50.750
I know.

1773
01:11:21.114 --> 01:11:23.450
Oh. Lord.

1774
01:11:24.117 --> 01:11:25.368
I thought your mother.

1775
01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:27.120
I mean.
people would never leave.

1776
01:11:27.579 --> 01:11:31.791
I'm just playing.
I|m just kidding.

1777
01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:33.668
It|s amazing.

1778
01:11:34.419 --> 01:11:35.337
Sure was.

1779
01:11:35.378 --> 01:11:36.755
You did so good.

1780
01:11:36.796 --> 01:11:37.797
I appreciate it.

1781
01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:39.466
This ring is so beautiful.

1782
01:11:41.134 --> 01:11:41.968
Mmm hmm.

1783
01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:42.802
I mean. everybody loved it.

1784
01:11:42.844 --> 01:11:43.762
Mmm hmm.

1785
01:11:44.137 --> 01:11:47.474
Even my mom. she loved it.

1786
01:11:47.515 --> 01:11:49.351
She was like.
oh. my God. this is amazing.

1787
01:11:49.851 --> 01:11:50.643
And it is amazing.

1788
01:11:52.854 --> 01:11:53.438
it's my exact ring.

1789
01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.148
How did you know?

1790
01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:56.566
this was my exact ring.

1791
01:11:56.608 --> 01:11:58.818
Well. I happened to sneak a peek

1792
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.028
at your vision board.

1793
01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:03.490
and I love you.

1794
01:12:04.991 --> 01:12:06.534
I love you. too.

1795
01:12:07.702 --> 01:12:08.661
I guess that means
I will be getting some tonight.

1796
01:12:08.703 --> 01:12:09.954
Mmm.

1797
01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:12.624
ooh shit.

1798
01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:17.003
Shall we?

1799
01:12:17.045 --> 01:12:18.797
Yes. we shall.

1800
01:12:25.887 --> 01:12:28.890
Oh. Oh.

1801
01:12:51.788 --> 01:12:52.580
oh. oh. oh.

1802
01:12:54.124 --> 01:12:57.085
oh. oh. oh. oh.

1803
01:13:00.255 --> 01:13:01.506
oh. oh.

1804
01:13:07.387 --> 01:13:09.347
Good morning.

1805
01:13:09.389 --> 01:13:10.598
Good morning. baby.

1806
01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.225
Smells good up in here. girl.

1807
01:13:12.559 --> 01:13:15.228
Muah... I made you breakfast.

1808
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:16.146
Oh. thank you.

1809
01:13:16.187 --> 01:13:16.938
Would you mind taking that coat

1810
01:13:17.605 --> 01:13:18.148
to the cleaners for me
when you get a chance?

1811
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:19.065
Oh. of course.

1812
01:13:19.107 --> 01:13:19.899
All right.

1813
01:13:19.941 --> 01:13:21.943
Now. I got to go to a meeting

1814
01:13:22.444 --> 01:13:23.445
Cause I got to make some money

1815
01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:24.696
back after that ring.

1816
01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:27.115
The most beautiful ring ever.

1817
01:13:29.117 --> 01:13:32.078
You have an amazing day.

1818
01:13:32.495 --> 01:13:33.204
I will do my best.

1819
01:13:33.246 --> 01:13:33.913
It's going to be hard.

1820
01:13:33.955 --> 01:13:35.957
Without you.

1821
01:13:36.958 --> 01:13:37.625
Ooo...

1822
01:13:39.461 --> 01:13:41.629
Mmm...

1823
01:13:43.089 --> 01:13:45.091
Mmm...

1824
01:13:45.925 --> 01:13:47.469
I told you
I'd give you the world. right?

1825
01:13:48.094 --> 01:13:48.970
Yeah.

1826
01:13:49.262 --> 01:13:49.637
I'm doing my best.

1827
01:13:52.974 --> 01:13:53.808
Oh. I love you.

1828
01:13:53.850 --> 01:13:55.352
I love you.

1829
01:13:55.393 --> 01:13:55.560
Right back.

1830
01:13:57.479 --> 01:13:58.188
Oh. yeah.

1831
01:13:58.813 --> 01:14:01.524
Okay now.
don't start something. now.

1832
01:14:03.109 --> 01:14:03.610
You have a fantastic day.

1833
01:14:03.902 --> 01:14:05.987
You too.

1834
01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:11.618
Hey mommy!

1835
01:14:12.118 --> 01:14:13.078
(Etta on phone)
Morning. sweetheart.

1836
01:14:13.328 --> 01:14:14.454
(Etta on phone)
Is Maurice there?

1837
01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:15.288
Oh. you know what?

1838
01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:16.081
He just left for work.

1839
01:14:16.664 --> 01:14:18.166
What do you want to talk
to Maurice for?

1840
01:14:19.834 --> 01:14:21.753
(Etta on phone)
I was hoping I could

1841
01:14:21.795 --> 01:14:23.171
(Etta on phone)
apologize to him.

1842
01:14:23.213 --> 01:14:25.674
Apologize. for what?

1843
01:14:26.966 --> 01:14:28.468
(Etta on phone)
I spoke to Kevin today.

1844
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:30.679
(Etta on phone)
and apparently Maurice was right

1845
01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.472
(Etta on phone)
Funds were in the account.

1846
01:14:32.847 --> 01:14:33.973
See. I told you. Mom.

1847
01:14:34.015 --> 01:14:34.891
he is a great guy.

1848
01:14:35.934 --> 01:14:37.727
(Etta on phone)
I don't know how great he is.

1849
01:14:37.769 --> 01:14:39.145
(Etta on phone)
but I did make sure

1850
01:14:39.187 --> 01:14:40.313
(Etta on phone)
he's still going to get

1851
01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:41.523
(Etta on phone)
his commission check.

1852
01:14:41.856 --> 01:14:44.025
Well. Maurice will be so...

1853
01:14:47.862 --> 01:14:50.782
(Etta on phone)
Honey?

1854
01:14:51.366 --> 01:14:54.202
(Etta on phone)
Nina?

1855
01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:34.576
Nina?

1856
01:15:35.368 --> 01:15:36.661
Nina.

1857
01:15:36.703 --> 01:15:37.620
Come on. we are drinking

1858
01:15:37.662 --> 01:15:38.872
bottomless.

1859
01:15:40.415 --> 01:15:40.957
Okay.

1860
01:15:42.667 --> 01:15:44.252
I don't want to drink.

1861
01:15:45.378 --> 01:15:45.670
What do you mean.

1862
01:15:46.171 --> 01:15:46.755
you don't want to drink?

1863
01:15:47.047 --> 01:15:47.422
Nina.

1864
01:15:47.464 --> 01:15:48.048
Ninaaa.

1865
01:15:48.089 --> 01:15:50.091
Nina. Nina.

1866
01:15:50.508 --> 01:15:51.468
You seem so upset.

1867
01:15:51.509 --> 01:15:52.719
what's wrong?

1868
01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:55.347
I think Maurice broke

1869
01:15:58.183 --> 01:15:58.641
The rule to our pass.

1870
01:15:59.934 --> 01:16:00.643
What?

1871
01:16:00.685 --> 01:16:02.270
Oh. hell. no.

1872
01:16:02.312 --> 01:16:03.271
What do you need me to do?

1873
01:16:03.313 --> 01:16:05.106
What rules
are you talking about?

1874
01:16:07.108 --> 01:16:08.318
He had one night

1875
01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:09.444
to do whatever you wanted to

1876
01:16:09.486 --> 01:16:10.737
do. right?

1877
01:16:12.113 --> 01:16:13.406
Apparently.
he's fucking this girl.

1878
01:16:13.448 --> 01:16:15.950
And. I mean. she sent naked
pictures of herself

1879
01:16:15.992 --> 01:16:17.410
to his phone.

1880
01:16:17.452 --> 01:16:18.244
And then this morning.

1881
01:16:18.286 --> 01:16:20.580
I woke up and I found it empty

1882
01:16:20.622 --> 01:16:22.957
condom wrapper in his jacket.

1883
01:16:23.667 --> 01:16:24.918
I knew I shouldn't have
done this shit.

1884
01:16:24.959 --> 01:16:26.252
No. no. no. no. no. no.

1885
01:16:26.294 --> 01:16:28.421
We can go get both those bitches
right now.

1886
01:16:28.463 --> 01:16:29.673
Oh. no. no. no. no. no.

1887
01:16:30.298 --> 01:16:31.341
Shay.

1888
01:16:31.383 --> 01:16:32.133
let's help

1889
01:16:32.175 --> 01:16:33.259
her figure this out right.

1890
01:16:35.428 --> 01:16:37.639
Maurice loves you. okay?

1891
01:16:38.807 --> 01:16:40.809
Now. he sacrificed a lot

1892
01:16:41.309 --> 01:16:41.643
to get to this ring.

1893
01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:45.689
Whatever it is. it's nothing.

1894
01:16:46.356 --> 01:16:49.442
But are you sure that you saw

1895
01:16:49.484 --> 01:16:50.360
naked pictures in his phone?

1896
01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:54.406
Yes. Yes. I'm sure I saw it.

1897
01:16:54.656 --> 01:16:56.032
I saw a naked woman.

1898
01:16:56.074 --> 01:16:57.367
It was right
there on his phone.

1899
01:16:58.451 --> 01:16:59.911
And then I try to go back
and check it again.

1900
01:16:59.953 --> 01:17:02.706
But. he changed
his password.

1901
01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:05.875
I'm sure you saw something else.

1902
01:17:06.835 --> 01:17:07.877
You couldn't have actually
seen the pictures

1903
01:17:07.919 --> 01:17:08.420
if he didn't have his
password. right?

1904
01:17:11.506 --> 01:17:12.674
I mean.

1905
01:17:13.675 --> 01:17:14.384
I didn't technically see it. but

1906
01:17:14.426 --> 01:17:15.218
The condom.

1907
01:17:15.552 --> 01:17:16.344
Right.

1908
01:17:17.387 --> 01:17:20.015
If he used a condom. maybe it wa
for the night of the pass.

1909
01:17:20.682 --> 01:17:23.685
What?
What do you mean?

1910
01:17:23.935 --> 01:17:26.646
If the condom was in his jacket.

1911
01:17:27.022 --> 01:17:28.982
at least he was being safe

1912
01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:30.608
the night of the pass.

1913
01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:32.193
All you need to do
is talk to him.

1914
01:17:33.278 --> 01:17:33.695
No.

1915
01:17:34.404 --> 01:17:36.614
All he|s going to do
is lie.

1916
01:17:36.656 --> 01:17:37.657
No. fuck that.

1917
01:17:37.907 --> 01:17:38.658
What you need to do

1918
01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:39.409
is get some real evidence.

1919
01:17:39.909 --> 01:17:42.203
You need to go all detective
on his ass.

1920
01:17:42.537 --> 01:17:43.997
Hey. you know. me?

1921
01:17:44.039 --> 01:17:44.914
I'm always going to have Deon

1922
01:17:44.956 --> 01:17:46.666
on 24 hour surveillance.

1923
01:17:46.708 --> 01:17:48.668
Okay?

1924
01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:50.462
I downloaded this app
on my phone.

1925
01:17:50.962 --> 01:17:53.256
and the app duplicates

1926
01:17:53.298 --> 01:17:54.674
everything on his phone

1927
01:17:54.716 --> 01:17:55.383
and puts it on my phone.

1928
01:17:55.425 --> 01:17:57.510
So if he gets any text

1929
01:17:57.552 --> 01:17:58.720
or anything like that.

1930
01:17:58.762 --> 01:18:00.138
he comes to my phone too.

1931
01:18:00.638 --> 01:18:02.349
So if he even thinks
about texting a ho.

1932
01:18:03.767 --> 01:18:04.351
It|s right here.

1933
01:18:04.392 --> 01:18:05.810
I don't like this.

1934
01:18:05.852 --> 01:18:07.062
It doesn't feel good.

1935
01:18:07.437 --> 01:18:08.897
And I don't I don't know this.

1936
01:18:08.938 --> 01:18:11.191
I need to know. Cali.

1937
01:18:11.232 --> 01:18:12.400
I need to know.

1938
01:18:12.442 --> 01:18:13.651
I also put cameras in my house.

1939
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:16.029
So if he thinks about bringing

1940
01:18:16.071 --> 01:18:17.280
a bitch over to my house.

1941
01:18:17.781 --> 01:18:18.865
Oh. girl.

1942
01:18:18.907 --> 01:18:20.116
You know what time I|m on.

1943
01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:24.537
Seriously.

1944
01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.999
if he's doing this to me.
I need to know.

1945
01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:30.293
Are you sure?

1946
01:18:30.585 --> 01:18:31.795
Yes. I|m sure.

1947
01:18:32.504 --> 01:18:33.797
Okay.

1948
01:18:33.838 --> 01:18:35.090
Show me how you
do this app.

1949
01:19:15.505 --> 01:19:17.465
“Phone dings”

1950
01:19:18.591 --> 01:19:19.634
That|s you babe?

1951
01:19:19.676 --> 01:19:20.927
Yeah babe.

1952
01:19:20.969 --> 01:19:22.846
I'm getting ready
to go to the store.

1953
01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.848
All right?

1954
01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:32.480
“Phone dings”

1955
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:34.607
I just sent you a client.

1956
01:19:34.649 --> 01:19:35.775
so you might want to follow up.

1957
01:19:35.817 --> 01:19:37.110
Okay.

1958
01:19:37.152 --> 01:19:37.360
Will do.

1959
01:19:45.827 --> 01:19:48.038
Love you.

1960
01:19:48.496 --> 01:19:49.497
Love you too.

1961
01:19:56.504 --> 01:20:11.436
“Music”

1962
01:20:11.436 --> 01:20:21.446
“Music”

1963
01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:35.418
Want more?

1964
01:20:38.004 --> 01:20:40.215
Okay. okay. okay. okay.

1965
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:43.218
Maurice is going
to be home soon.

1966
01:20:46.054 --> 01:20:46.346
Yeah. you don't
want to get caught.

1967
01:20:49.683 --> 01:20:51.017
Okay.

1968
01:20:51.393 --> 01:20:52.894
I'll go.

1969
01:21:09.202 --> 01:21:12.288
We could do a
couple quick more.

1970
01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:14.582
Real quick.

1971
01:21:14.624 --> 01:21:17.085
I know. it's just so late.

1972
01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:22.090
Oh.

1973
01:21:26.761 --> 01:21:28.096
these are cute.

1974
01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:30.890
I wish I could see you

1975
01:21:30.932 --> 01:21:31.433
model these.

1976
01:21:33.768 --> 01:21:34.936
Those aren't mine.

1977
01:21:36.438 --> 01:21:39.441
Oh.

1978
01:21:40.108 --> 01:21:42.610
Those aren't fucking mine.

1979
01:21:43.945 --> 01:21:45.697
This means he's fucking
her in the house.

1980
01:21:45.739 --> 01:21:47.032
Are you serious?

1981
01:21:47.073 --> 01:21:47.449
You don't really know that yet.

1982
01:21:49.576 --> 01:21:50.577
What do you mean?

1983
01:21:54.622 --> 01:21:55.623
I mean.

1984
01:21:57.584 --> 01:21:58.626
I don't know.

1985
01:22:03.048 --> 01:22:06.551
You gonna be alright?

1986
01:22:14.476 --> 01:22:17.354
(Terra off screen)
Call me if you need me.

1987
01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:37.582
(Shay on phone)
Hello?

1988
01:22:37.624 --> 01:22:38.833
Shay!

1989
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:40.794
(Shay on phone)
Hey girl. are you okay?

1990
01:22:40.835 --> 01:22:41.628
I need to get those cameras
in the house

1991
01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:42.879
ASAP.

1992
01:22:43.421 --> 01:22:44.506
(Shay on phone)
Okay. okay.

1993
01:22:44.547 --> 01:22:46.466
(Shay on phone)
Um. whatever you need.

1994
01:22:46.508 --> 01:22:46.966
(Shay on phone)
I'm right here.

1995
01:22:47.425 --> 01:22:47.467
(Shay on phone)
I got you.

1996
01:22:49.719 --> 01:22:50.428
(Shay on phone)
Okay.

1997
01:22:51.096 --> 01:22:51.805
(Shay on phone)
When you put the cameras up.

1998
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.681
(Shay on phone)
make sure you get the whole room

1999
01:22:53.598 --> 01:22:55.558
(Shay on phone)
And angle it right.

2000
01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:57.602
You know what talking about.
right?

2001
01:22:57.644 --> 01:22:59.229
I need you to turn the camera

2002
01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:00.522
the way that I told you.

2003
01:23:01.106 --> 01:23:01.898
Yeah. I'm

2004
01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.149
putting off the cameras now.

2005
01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:04.609
Okay. good.

2006
01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.695
This is really good.

2007
01:23:06.736 --> 01:23:07.278
Yeah. Like the 52.

2008
01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:08.905
Yes. that works.

2009
01:23:08.947 --> 01:23:10.532
Great job.

2010
01:23:10.573 --> 01:23:13.159
Yeah. Yes.

2011
01:23:15.745 --> 01:23:17.330
(Terra off screen)
Yes?

2012
01:23:17.997 --> 01:23:19.374
You need some alone time?

2013
01:23:20.291 --> 01:23:21.751
No. we don't.
because we're discussing

2014
01:23:21.793 --> 01:23:23.044
the Bentley Hotel.

2015
01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.215
Can you give us a moment.
please?

2016
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:28.758
Oh. okay.

2017
01:23:29.092 --> 01:23:29.592
Thank you.

2018
01:23:29.884 --> 01:23:30.593
And when you done. just

2019
01:23:30.635 --> 01:23:32.303
come back to my office.

2020
01:23:44.858 --> 01:23:46.276
Are you okay?

2021
01:23:46.735 --> 01:23:48.236
I sense a little hostility.

2022
01:24:00.957 --> 01:24:03.835
Stop fucking my assistant.

2023
01:24:05.962 --> 01:24:07.339
I pay the checks around here.

2024
01:24:08.006 --> 01:24:10.342
That means I am the boss.

2025
01:24:11.468 --> 01:24:12.218
And besides.

2026
01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:12.344
you can't do this. remember?

2027
01:24:14.012 --> 01:24:15.472
Because you don't want me.

2028
01:24:16.973 --> 01:24:20.352
Or do you want me?

2029
01:24:23.646 --> 01:24:31.112
Do you want me?

2030
01:24:42.123 --> 01:24:43.500
Maurice has to go out of town.

2031
01:24:48.630 --> 01:24:49.381
You should come over.

2032
01:24:56.805 --> 01:24:58.181
You ready?

2033
01:24:58.640 --> 01:24:59.683
Absolutely.

2034
01:25:02.936 --> 01:25:04.896
Bring some wine.

2035
01:25:10.694 --> 01:25:13.822
We have work to do.

2036
01:25:42.183 --> 01:25:44.519
I|m leaving Maurice.

2037
01:25:47.105 --> 01:25:47.480
What?

2038
01:25:51.192 --> 01:25:51.526
It's.

2039
01:25:53.778 --> 01:25:54.863
I can't do this anymore.

2040
01:25:57.323 --> 01:25:58.408
I mean. he lies so much. He...

2041
01:25:59.993 --> 01:26:01.411
He lies to my face.

2042
01:26:08.501 --> 01:26:09.711
I'm going to divorce him.

2043
01:26:11.838 --> 01:26:13.798
Are you sure?

2044
01:26:15.008 --> 01:26:16.801
Are you serious?

2045
01:26:16.843 --> 01:26:18.219
I mean...

2046
01:26:20.388 --> 01:26:22.265
You make me feel so good and

2047
01:26:23.850 --> 01:26:25.060
the way you make me feel.

2048
01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:26.519
I mean.

2049
01:26:27.062 --> 01:26:28.646
I can't stop thinking about you.

2050
01:26:32.317 --> 01:26:33.485
I want us to be together.

2051
01:26:36.404 --> 01:26:37.947
I will literally

2052
01:26:37.989 --> 01:26:39.324
give all this up for you.

2053
01:26:50.752 --> 01:26:51.961
That's sweet.

2054
01:26:58.802 --> 01:26:58.927
What are you doing?

2055
01:26:59.427 --> 01:27:00.762
I'm gonna umm..

2056
01:27:01.096 --> 01:27:02.055
I'm going to give Alison

2057
01:27:02.097 --> 01:27:02.430
the Bentley job.

2058
01:27:05.725 --> 01:27:06.935
Wait.

2059
01:27:07.519 --> 01:27:09.270
What do you mean?

2060
01:27:10.105 --> 01:27:11.481
I mean.

2061
01:27:11.523 --> 01:27:12.774
I think she's qualified.

2062
01:27:13.024 --> 01:27:15.026
and I've decided to do that.

2063
01:27:15.944 --> 01:27:18.405
My assistant...

2064
01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.532
What the hell are you thinking?

2065
01:27:21.825 --> 01:27:22.450
What am I thinking?

2066
01:27:22.492 --> 01:27:23.284
You're fucking her.

2067
01:27:23.326 --> 01:27:24.244
That's what it is.

2068
01:27:24.285 --> 01:27:25.328
You're fucking her.

2069
01:27:26.079 --> 01:27:26.830
That's the only reason why you
would give her the hotel.

2070
01:27:27.330 --> 01:27:28.873
I am thinking
that she can handle it.

2071
01:27:35.255 --> 01:27:35.505
Where are you going?

2072
01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:37.716
What are you doing?

2073
01:27:38.508 --> 01:27:40.802
I|m about to go meet
Alison. to go over the specs

2074
01:27:41.094 --> 01:27:42.429
for the job.

2075
01:27:42.929 --> 01:27:44.848
This was sweet.

2076
01:27:46.307 --> 01:27:47.517
Thank you.

2077
01:28:18.465 --> 01:28:21.384
Lord. Lord. Lord I|m tired.

2078
01:28:24.846 --> 01:28:26.806
Hey baby.

2079
01:28:29.309 --> 01:28:29.851
Hey babe.

2080
01:28:29.893 --> 01:28:32.520
What|s wrong?

2081
01:28:39.861 --> 01:28:43.907
Hey babe.

2082
01:28:48.995 --> 01:28:49.954
Can we just go away?

2083
01:28:49.996 --> 01:28:51.956
Maybe. just.

2084
01:28:52.624 --> 01:28:54.376
I really need to get away.

2085
01:28:55.543 --> 01:28:57.420
Just you and me.

2086
01:28:59.756 --> 01:28:59.798
Okay?

2087
01:29:00.757 --> 01:29:01.883
Just.

2088
01:29:02.217 --> 01:29:03.885
as much time as we can.

2089
01:29:03.927 --> 01:29:10.725
Just try to reconnect.

2090
01:29:12.227 --> 01:29:13.269
Maybe go to Fiji.

2091
01:29:13.311 --> 01:29:14.562
I don't know.

2092
01:29:15.397 --> 01:29:16.564
Fiji?

2093
01:29:24.155 --> 01:29:24.572
It's not a bad idea.

2094
01:29:28.743 --> 01:29:30.870
We're going to be okay. right?

2095
01:29:33.873 --> 01:29:35.000
Yes.

2096
01:29:51.141 --> 01:29:52.183
What?

2097
01:29:54.185 --> 01:29:55.311
Nothing.

2098
01:29:55.353 --> 01:29:56.062
I just want to remember

2099
01:29:56.104 --> 01:29:56.521
the way you look.

2100
01:29:58.648 --> 01:29:59.858
In this very moment.

2101
01:30:08.658 --> 01:30:09.576
Seem pretty tired.

2102
01:30:09.617 --> 01:30:10.744
why don't you go to sleep.

2103
01:30:11.745 --> 01:30:12.495
I|m going to make myself
something to eat.

2104
01:30:24.341 --> 01:30:25.550
Get out of here.

2105
01:30:40.148 --> 01:30:41.399
Listen. just.

2106
01:30:41.441 --> 01:30:43.026
Just calm down.

2107
01:30:43.401 --> 01:30:45.111
I know him. okay.

2108
01:30:45.612 --> 01:30:46.988
He's my best friend.

2109
01:30:47.572 --> 01:30:48.865
He knows nothing.

2110
01:30:49.866 --> 01:30:52.202
and he will never know anything

2111
01:30:54.496 --> 01:30:55.872
Nina.

2112
01:30:58.041 --> 01:31:00.960
Nina Franklin Baptist?

2113
01:31:01.461 --> 01:31:02.962
Yeah. that's me.

2114
01:31:03.463 --> 01:31:04.964
You've been served.

2115
01:31:11.471 --> 01:31:12.347
This is.

2116
01:31:12.389 --> 01:31:13.556
This is nothing to worry about.

2117
01:31:13.598 --> 01:31:14.808
We'll figure it out.

2118
01:31:15.767 --> 01:31:17.185
No.

2119
01:31:19.187 --> 01:31:20.980
listen. don't stress.

2120
01:31:21.773 --> 01:31:22.691
I can. I can make
it all disappear.

2121
01:31:23.233 --> 01:31:23.983
This is not okay!

2122
01:31:24.025 --> 01:31:24.901
Don't worry about it.

2123
01:31:24.943 --> 01:31:26.027
It's fine.

2124
01:31:27.278 --> 01:31:28.530
Nina. Nina.

2125
01:31:30.407 --> 01:31:31.157
The terms of

2126
01:31:31.199 --> 01:31:33.201
the prenuptial agreement

2127
01:31:33.618 --> 01:31:35.203
on the grounds of infidelity.

2128
01:31:35.829 --> 01:31:38.123
My client would like to present

2129
01:31:38.581 --> 01:31:39.791
exhibits proving

2130
01:31:40.041 --> 01:31:41.418
that her husband.

2131
01:31:41.459 --> 01:31:43.420
Mr. Baptiste. not only stepped

2132
01:31:43.461 --> 01:31:44.671
outside of their marriage.

2133
01:31:44.713 --> 01:31:46.506
but did so in the confines

2134
01:31:46.548 --> 01:31:47.757
of their home.

2135
01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:58.685
Would your client like

2136
01:31:58.727 --> 01:31:59.561
to respond to this evidence?

2137
01:32:01.354 --> 01:32:02.188
My client can prove

2138
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:03.231
he has had no connection

2139
01:32:03.273 --> 01:32:04.524
with the cell phone
correspondent.

2140
01:32:04.899 --> 01:32:05.984
He's even had to purchase

2141
01:32:06.609 --> 01:32:08.528
a new cell phone
to remedy the insistent contact.

2142
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:09.654
Further. any dealings he's

2143
01:32:09.696 --> 01:32:11.239
had with the staff
of a gentlemen's club

2144
01:32:11.656 --> 01:32:12.407
at the time in question

2145
01:32:12.449 --> 01:32:14.117
was strictly professional.

2146
01:32:15.452 --> 01:32:16.661
Mrs. Baptiste

2147
01:32:17.078 --> 01:32:19.789
Ms. Franklin.

2148
01:32:22.459 --> 01:32:23.835
He|s just covering his basis.

2149
01:32:24.461 --> 01:32:26.254
I can prove he cheated.

2150
01:32:31.426 --> 01:32:32.677
He had a pass.

2151
01:32:33.011 --> 01:32:34.888
A what?

2152
01:32:40.977 --> 01:32:42.187
It's umm...

2153
01:32:42.854 --> 01:32:45.315
He came to me with this idea

2154
01:32:46.941 --> 01:32:48.777
that we would each sleep

2155
01:32:48.818 --> 01:32:50.987
with someone else for one night.

2156
01:32:53.448 --> 01:32:54.616
And initially.

2157
01:32:54.991 --> 01:32:55.700
I told him I

2158
01:32:55.742 --> 01:32:57.243
did not want to do that.

2159
01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:00.288
but he insisted.

2160
01:33:04.501 --> 01:33:05.710
and I gave in.

2161
01:33:10.757 --> 01:33:12.550
But he went beyond

2162
01:33:12.592 --> 01:33:14.177
that one night and

2163
01:33:15.387 --> 01:33:17.263
he lied about it in my face

2164
01:33:17.305 --> 01:33:18.306
repeatedly.

2165
01:33:20.058 --> 01:33:23.770
He brought that bitch
in our home.

2166
01:33:24.187 --> 01:33:25.939
Ma|am. I have no idea

2167
01:33:25.980 --> 01:33:28.233
what she's talking about.
nor do I know what a pass is.

2168
01:33:28.692 --> 01:33:29.275
You're lying!

2169
01:33:33.405 --> 01:33:36.908
But. I do have this.

2170
01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.413
If you'll just press play.
please.

2171
01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:55.260
“Sexual noises play
from the phone.”

2172
01:33:59.931 --> 01:34:01.182
Nina.

2173
01:34:01.474 --> 01:34:02.684
Nina.

2174
01:34:03.435 --> 01:34:04.144
No. it's.

2175
01:34:04.185 --> 01:34:06.146
What is this?

2176
01:34:10.358 --> 01:34:12.360
I think that is destruction of
property. if I'm not mistaken.

2177
01:34:12.402 --> 01:34:15.488
Well. according
to the prenuptial agreement

2178
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:17.824
any acts of infidelity

2179
01:34:18.241 --> 01:34:19.325
on the part of Ms..

2180
01:34:19.951 --> 01:34:22.829
Franklin constitutes

2181
01:34:22.871 --> 01:34:27.292
Mr. Baptiste to half
of all of the marital assets.

2182
01:34:27.334 --> 01:34:27.584
And alimony.

2183
01:34:28.168 --> 01:34:30.837
Which includes half of the

2184
01:34:30.879 --> 01:34:32.297
money you recently
received from the trust fund.

2185
01:34:34.049 --> 01:34:36.468
Why would you do that to me?

2186
01:34:37.802 --> 01:34:38.470
After everything

2187
01:34:38.511 --> 01:34:39.637
I ever did for you.

2188
01:34:39.679 --> 01:34:40.680
How could you
do this to me.

2189
01:34:40.722 --> 01:34:42.057
Nina.

2190
01:34:46.353 --> 01:34:47.937
I loved you so much.

2191
01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:49.814
Yet you still couldn't

2192
01:34:49.856 --> 01:34:50.273
remain faithful.

2193
01:34:52.692 --> 01:34:53.818
“Scream”

2194
01:34:58.281 --> 01:34:59.366
Nina. calm down.

2195
01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:03.995
Ms. Franklin.

2196
01:35:04.746 --> 01:35:07.082
if you leave these proceedings.

2197
01:35:08.041 --> 01:35:09.751
you will be held in contempt.

2198
01:35:15.674 --> 01:35:17.634
Fuck you!

2199
01:35:17.676 --> 01:35:18.426
Fuck you! Son of a bitch.

2200
01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:19.719
Miss Franklin!

2201
01:35:19.761 --> 01:35:21.554
You ain't shit!

2202
01:35:21.971 --> 01:35:22.347
And you won't be shit!

2203
01:35:27.519 --> 01:35:28.895
Okay?

2204
01:35:28.937 --> 01:35:29.354
I guess we're on our own.

2205
01:35:35.610 --> 01:35:36.945
You can get through this.

2206
01:35:38.029 --> 01:35:40.281
Congratulations. everyone!

2207
01:35:52.043 --> 01:35:55.213
Because you don't want me.

2208
01:35:56.131 --> 01:35:56.548
Or do you?

2209
01:35:58.633 --> 01:35:59.259
Well. welcome.

2210
01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.094
ladies and gentlemen.

2211
01:36:01.344 --> 01:36:03.972
We have arrived.

2212
01:36:04.514 --> 01:36:05.598
Breathe.

2213
01:36:05.807 --> 01:36:07.183
I know.

2214
01:36:08.852 --> 01:36:09.394
I got you.

2215
01:36:09.436 --> 01:36:10.979
You hear me?

2216
01:36:15.483 --> 01:36:17.569
Look at me.

2217
01:36:18.319 --> 01:36:18.611
Look at me.

2218
01:36:19.029 --> 01:36:20.822
You still a winner.

2219
01:36:20.864 --> 01:36:21.823
You hear me.

2220
01:36:22.157 --> 01:36:23.408
I love you.
I|m so proud of you.

2221
01:36:25.744 --> 01:36:26.453
I|m so proud of you.

2222
01:36:27.579 --> 01:36:28.830
We|ll get through this okay.

2223
01:36:37.672 --> 01:36:39.007
Good job. boss lady.

2224
01:36:39.507 --> 01:36:41.092
$9.5 million.

2225
01:36:41.676 --> 01:36:42.552
That's a nice haul.

2226
01:36:42.594 --> 01:36:43.219
It's pretty nice.

2227
01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.180
We could have done
a little better

2228
01:36:45.221 --> 01:36:47.140
Not bad. but a little
bit too long.

2229
01:36:47.182 --> 01:36:48.475
No more seven year swindles.
please.

2230
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:52.312
So. whats up boss lady

2231
01:36:52.645 --> 01:36:53.646
who's next?

2232
01:36:53.688 --> 01:36:54.981
Well. according to the docket.

2233
01:36:55.690 --> 01:36:56.399
Shay. you up next.

2234
01:36:57.192 --> 01:36:59.652
Oh. that should be interesting.

2235
01:36:59.694 --> 01:37:00.445
Oh. yes.

2236
01:37:00.862 --> 01:37:03.073
Oh. girl.
we have you a good one.

2237
01:37:03.782 --> 01:37:05.700
He's old and widowed.

2238
01:37:05.742 --> 01:37:06.618
Oh. just the way I like them.

2239
01:37:08.203 --> 01:37:09.704
It should be pretty easy
for you. right?

2240
01:37:09.746 --> 01:37:11.164
Oh. that's a piece of cake.

2241
01:37:11.206 --> 01:37:11.915
Yes. Yes.

2242
01:37:11.956 --> 01:37:13.541
And he is a frisky one.

2243
01:37:13.917 --> 01:37:16.002
Loves a woman with curves.

2244
01:37:16.044 --> 01:37:18.672
so you could just put it on him.

2245
01:37:18.713 --> 01:37:19.839
So you go.

2246
01:37:19.881 --> 01:37:21.132
You going to be
fucking a sugar daddy.

2247
01:37:21.174 --> 01:37:23.343
Sounds better
than being married to this one.

2248
01:37:23.385 --> 01:37:24.344
Hey. you no walk

2249
01:37:24.386 --> 01:37:25.220
in the park either.

2250
01:37:26.429 --> 01:37:27.138
(Deon off screen)
You ready though?

2251
01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:29.683
Oh. I'm more than ready.

2252
01:37:29.724 --> 01:37:30.600
And it won't take me seven years

2253
01:37:30.850 --> 01:37:32.519
to get it.

2254
01:37:40.276 --> 01:37:41.319
Maurice.

2255
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:44.114
why don't you use the pass

2256
01:37:45.281 --> 01:37:46.282
on. Nina?

2257
01:37:46.574 --> 01:37:48.535
Ayo!

2258
01:37:49.994 --> 01:37:50.412
Ayo. Trent!

2259
01:37:53.164 --> 01:37:54.374
Ay. Trent from Boston.

2260
01:37:56.751 --> 01:37:57.711
I knew that was you.

2261
01:37:58.003 --> 01:37:59.254
You fucking crook!

2262
01:38:10.056 --> 01:38:12.267
I also put cameras in my house.

2263
01:38:13.101 --> 01:38:14.561
So if he thinks about
bringing a bitch

2264
01:38:14.602 --> 01:38:16.396
over to my house. girl.

2265
01:38:16.646 --> 01:38:17.647
You know what time I'm on.

2266
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:20.400
and he's not it.

2267
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:23.111
He is not the best. not him.

2268
01:38:23.695 --> 01:38:24.738
not his friends.

2269
01:38:24.779 --> 01:38:26.448
and definitely not that

2270
01:38:26.823 --> 01:38:27.532
Terra woman.
