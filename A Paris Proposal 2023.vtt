00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.206
Hi.
you've reached Sebastian Laurent

4
00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.541
with Dash Creative.

5
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:42.876
I'm off creating.

6
00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.336
{\an8}Leave a message.

7
00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:46.463
{\an8}Clearly. I haven't
reached Sebastian Laurent

8
00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:47.672
{\an8}with Dash Creative.

9
00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.215
{\an8}We were supposed to
meet here in the office

10
00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.384
{\an8}to go over our research
for the pitch meeting.

11
00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.469
{\an8}Where are you?

12
00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.262
Leave a message.

13
00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:55.722
{\an8}Sebastian. where are you?

14
00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.015
{\an8}The client is already seated.

15
00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:58.850
{\an8}Am I supposed to do
this pitch alone?

16
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.895
{\an8}Please just call me back.

17
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.022
{\an8}Anna.

18
00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.482
{\an8}Where have you been?

19
00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.067
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

20
00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.818
{\an8}I was literally at the office
doing all the markers--

21
00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.445
{\an8}Relax.

22
00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:11.988
{\an8}I was doing market research.
too. from our market.

23
00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.490
{\an8}Several. actually.

24
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.492
{\an8}I had to go to a few stores
to find all the flavors.

25
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:16.659
Here. try this.

26
00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.036
No. they're literally waiting.

27
00:01:18.036 --> 00:01:19.037
And the clients are
going to want to see

28
00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.080
that we know their product.

29
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.830
Quick. drink.

30
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.630
OK. now try orange.

31
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.594
Not bad.

32
00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.553
OK?

33
00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:36.179
Yes.

34
00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:37.722
OK. let's go.

35
00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.182
Don't forget your tote.

36
00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.643
Don't forget your broomstick.

37
00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.144
{\an8}What do you got for us?

38
00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:46.606
{\an8}And why shouldn't we stick
with our current agency?

39
00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:49.859
Well. first of all. have
you thought about changing

40
00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.112
the name of your brand?

41
00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:54.322
He's joking.

42
00:01:54.322 --> 00:01:56.658
Please. they think
you're serious.

43
00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.034
OK. we keep it.

44
00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:02.330
Um. the beauty of
Fizzarup Soda is

45
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.418
that it's all natural.
non-GMO. gluten-free. vegan.

46
00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:08.378
Parents can feel good
about it. and the kids

47
00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.422
don't need to know that
it's good for them.

48
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:13.174
The 12 to 19-year-old age
range makes up the largest

49
00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:15.343
consumption of soft
drinks in America.

50
00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.929
We really don't feel like
you're tapping into that market.

51
00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.347
We have algorithms
that analyze--

52
00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:22.475
Bubbles. bubbles. bubbles.

53
00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.310
Bubbles.

54
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.063
Have you seen those
giant plastic balls

55
00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:28.857
filled with air. the
ones that you can

56
00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.316
jump inside and roll around in?

57
00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:30.734
Yes.

58
00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.068
Yeah.

59
00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:33.361
My daughter had them
at her pool party.

60
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.406
We open on a group
of teenagers at a lake.

61
00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.158
They are bored out
of their minds.

62
00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.993
They take a drink
of Fizzarup Soda.

63
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.370
and then suddenly a
helicopter swoops in.

64
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.330
drops the balls out of the sky.

65
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.499
They jump into the lake.
run into the water.

66
00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.168
and jump inside.

67
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:52.297
At the end. they morph into
tiny. floating bubbles.

68
00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:54.466
Find your fizz with Fizzarup.

69
00:02:56.968 --> 00:02:57.635
I love it.

70
00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:58.345
That's bold.

71
00:02:58.345 --> 00:02:59.721
Also very expensive.

72
00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.890
I mean. the insurance
alone on that would--

73
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.183
I'm sorry--

74
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.434
It does sound
expensive. Sebastian.

75
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.186
As you know. we're
a smaller startup.

76
00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.104
You can't put a price
on a great concept.

77
00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:10.523
Well. I mean.
actually. you can.

78
00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.150
We can come up with
a different idea.

79
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.818
Yeah. like what?

80
00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:17.739
Well. like something with
a feasible budget. a campaign

81
00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.449
that I can actually deliver.

82
00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.951
OK.

83
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:25.663
We will find something.

84
00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.374
We are never going
to set ourselves up

85
00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:29.459
for success if you keep
overpromising to the clients.

86
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.044
You saw the way
their eyes lit up.

87
00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:32.337
They'll find the money.

88
00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.048
Sebastian. I'm
your account manager.

89
00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:36.466
The client comes
to me if something

90
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.343
goes wrong or for over budget.

91
00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.303
I need you to respect what I do.

92
00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:41.596
I'll see you at the office.

93
00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:46.976
He's not a team
player. Caroline.

94
00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.228
I am concerned
that you are not

95
00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:49.979
embracing your creative side.

96
00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.439
Remember when you
first started. you

97
00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.733
were not afraid to speak
up. veer out of your lane

98
00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:54.818
if it made an idea better.

99
00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.611
No. I can do that again.

100
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.571
Have you heard
of Durand Diamonds?

101
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.322
Yeah. of course.

102
00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:00.448
They're huge in Europe.

103
00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:01.533
Exactly.

104
00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.535
Now they want to
be huge in America.

105
00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:05.161
We're in the running
for the account.

106
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:07.831
I'm sending you to Paris.

107
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:09.165
Oh.

108
00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.709
You heard me right.

109
00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.419
I said Paris?

110
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.004
Oui.

111
00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:16.965
Yeah. I love everything French--
the toasts. the manicures.

112
00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.091
They're great.

113
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.718
Oh. how do we hear about this?

114
00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.053
I happen to know Louis and
Marianne Jerome from back home.

115
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.638
They reached out.

116
00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:26.599
This is a top priority
for them and Dash Creative.

117
00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.350
Pack your bags.

118
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.226
You leave tomorrow.

119
00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.019
I'm sorry. what?

120
00:04:29.019 --> 00:04:30.395
Together?

121
00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:31.312
Well. I still think
you have the potential

122
00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:32.480
to be a great team.

123
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.523
You know. I
really feel like you

124
00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:34.232
should send Margaret for this.

125
00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:35.108
She'd be great.

126
00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.359
Anna. you're reliable.

127
00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.360
You're a problem solver.

128
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.695
You keep the trains running.

129
00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:40.363
I want you for this.

130
00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.240
Perhaps Anna could keep the
trains running in New York.

131
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.700
We have a lot of them here.

132
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.785
The way I see it.
you're going to teach Anna

133
00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.371
to color using all the
crayons in the box again.

134
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:50.290
And Anna. you're going
to show Sebastian

135
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.917
how to color inside the lines.

136
00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:53.835
Now don't let me down.

137
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.051
I'm sorry. what was that?

138
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.679
I said. I can't
wait to work together.

139
00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:49.265
Hello?

140
00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:50.809
Hey.

141
00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.352
Lily. did I wake you up?

142
00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:54.145
Oh. no. no. no.

143
00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:56.356
No. no. no. I need to be up
in. like. three hours anyway.

144
00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.273
What's going on?

145
00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.818
Well. I'm coming to Paris.

146
00:05:59.818 --> 00:06:03.071
Oh won't you I thought you
said you were never coming back

147
00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.072
here.

148
00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:05.532
I mean. it's for work.

149
00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:06.950
We're trying to land the
Durand Diamonds account.

150
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.951
Nice.

151
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:09.119
When do you get here?

152
00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:10.203
Tomorrow.

153
00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.247
I'm like totally freaking out.

154
00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:13.832
Yeah. no. babe.

155
00:06:13.832 --> 00:06:17.919
I don't blame you. but
when you land the account

156
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:22.382
and you're the big hero at work.
you can finally put Paris back

157
00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:23.675
on your map.

158
00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:24.467
I miss you.

159
00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:25.760
Can't wait to see you.

160
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.845
You. too.

161
00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:27.929
Call me when you land.

162
00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:28.722
OK.

163
00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:29.514
Love you. buds.

164
00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.899
So when was the last
time you were in Paris?

165
00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:43.403
It's been about three years
since I started at the agency.

166
00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:45.071
How do you know the Laurents?

167
00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.366
My family's department
store carries their jewelry.

168
00:06:48.366 --> 00:06:49.075
Really?

169
00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.827
Which one?

170
00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.495
Laurent.

171
00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:56.499
Laurent like as in
your last name Laurent?

172
00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.251
I did not know that.

173
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.587
Yeah. my brother
runs the business.

174
00:07:00.587 --> 00:07:03.256
I used to be the
VP of marketing.

175
00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.092
It was actually my favorite
store when I lived in Paris.

176
00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.761
Well. my favorite window store.

177
00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:09.763
I could never actually
afford anything in there.

178
00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.223
Yeah. I noticed you
had a pretty good accent.

179
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.350
Thank you.

180
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.226
I studied at the Sorbonne.

181
00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.729
You're full of surprises.

182
00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.441
Have you had a chance to look
at the research packet yet?

183
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.859
Where's our car?

184
00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.944
You know. it's crazy
to think that America

185
00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:28.281
is responsible for half the
sales in the world's jewelry.

186
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.617
Research is the
enemy of creativity.

187
00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:31.826
That's a little harsh.

188
00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:33.578
I already know
the Durand brand.

189
00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.580
No. you know the
Durand brand in Paris.

190
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.207
We have to tailor
it for America.

191
00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:38.750
Do you have any ideas?

192
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.294
For me. inspiration hits
when I least expect it.

193
00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.922
Ah. there's our car.

194
00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.282
The rosé diamond.

195
00:08:11.282 --> 00:08:13.743
17 carats.

196
00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:15.328
Flawless.

197
00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:17.622
It was designed
by Bernard Durand.

198
00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:19.791
His nephew Louis
now runs a business.

199
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.168
He's known as the
"king of diamonds."

200
00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:25.672
Well. here comes the queen.

201
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:29.843
The rosé can be
yours for $23 million.

202
00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.762
We already know the
color is perfect for you.

203
00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.389
Oh. merci.

204
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:36.850
Does it come with a set
of matching bodyguards?

205
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.477
Anna Bowman. Dash
Creative account manager.

206
00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:42.522
So nice to meet you. Anna.

207
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:46.026
And Sebastian.

208
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:49.863
Come. Louis will meet
us in the showroom.

209
00:08:49.863 --> 00:08:52.157
We must apologize
for the short notice.

210
00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:55.452
But we've been pitched by
three American agencies.

211
00:08:55.452 --> 00:08:58.705
and [laughs] they
haven't worked out.

212
00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:01.499
We are trying to beat our
biggest competitor to the US

213
00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:02.500
market.

214
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.960
Ah. yes. Tropez Diamonds.

215
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.212
Oui. Tropez Diamond.

216
00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.922
And then it hit me.

217
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:11.134
I remember that you went away
to work in New York. Sebastian.

218
00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:14.346
You always understood
our brand so well.

219
00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:17.223
We think you could
be the perfect fit.

220
00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:19.517
Merci.

221
00:09:19.517 --> 00:09:21.936
Your parents. are they well?

222
00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:23.188
Um. they're fine.

223
00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:24.731
Good.

224
00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:27.484
I'm so sorry about what
happened at the store.

225
00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:30.070
Let's remind your
father how brilliant

226
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.781
you are with a great
campaign for Durand.

227
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:35.450
He and your mother are
coming to the charity gala

228
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.202
next weekend.

229
00:09:37.202 --> 00:09:39.079
You both should come.

230
00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:42.165
Oh. unfortunately. we are
only here for a few days.

231
00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.166
but thank you.

232
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:45.877
So you have a pitch already?

233
00:09:45.877 --> 00:09:46.711
We do.

234
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:47.962
You're going to love it.

235
00:09:47.962 --> 00:09:49.172
Well. great.

236
00:09:49.172 --> 00:09:50.757
Do you know Paris. Anna?

237
00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:53.385
Yes. yes. I love it here.

238
00:09:53.385 --> 00:10:04.437
I actually-- I haven't been
back. um. since our honeymoon.

239
00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.023
No. you two are married?

240
00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.233
Oh. I-- I mean--

241
00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:10.819
I always feel that a
couple who work together

242
00:10:10.819 --> 00:10:13.071
bring something so special.

243
00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.407
I am so happy.

244
00:10:15.407 --> 00:10:18.243
Your parents never said anything
about a wedding. Sebastian.

245
00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:20.954
Uh. they. um-- they. um--

246
00:10:20.954 --> 00:10:22.997
they don't know.

247
00:10:22.997 --> 00:10:23.957
Ah.

248
00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:25.625
Say no more.

249
00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:28.461
Maria and I have been
running the business together

250
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.880
for 30 years.

251
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.841
How long have you been together?

252
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:36.678
Uh. yeah. it's actually
our one-year anniversary.

253
00:10:37.846 --> 00:10:39.806
Yes. it's been a whirlwind.

254
00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:40.849
Yes.

255
00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.267
Where was the wedding?

256
00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:42.976
Las Vegas.

257
00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:43.810
The courthouse.

258
00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.936
Where?

259
00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.980
It was at the Las
Vegas courthouse.

260
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.275
Well. this trip cannot
just be about business.

261
00:10:50.275 --> 00:10:55.155
You two need to relive the
magic of your Paris honeymoon.

262
00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:56.114
We don't.

263
00:10:56.114 --> 00:10:57.532
Where are you staying?

264
00:10:57.532 --> 00:11:00.493
Um. the hotel at
the convention center.

265
00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.203
No. [speaking french].

266
00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:06.082
I am going to get my assistant
to find you a room at the Lux.

267
00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.084
It is where we are
hosting the gala.

268
00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:08.918
Please. we--

269
00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.128
We would love to stay there.

270
00:11:10.128 --> 00:11:12.172
Great.

271
00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:13.590
Excuse me. Anna.

272
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.052
I notice you are wearing
your ring as a necklace?

273
00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:20.972
And no wedding
band either of you.

274
00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.265
Oh.

275
00:11:22.265 --> 00:11:24.809
Yes. well. it's embarrassing.

276
00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.936
My fingers are swollen
from the airplane.

277
00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:30.357
And I lost mine
right down the drain.

278
00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:35.070
Well.
you've come to the right place.

279
00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:41.284
What just happened?

280
00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:42.202
What were you thinking?

281
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.620
Me?

282
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.829
You're the one who
said "our honeymoon."

283
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.498
You said "our
anniversary" and then

284
00:11:46.498 --> 00:11:48.625
you told them they were going to
love a pitch that we don't even

285
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:49.542
have yet.

286
00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.211
And then I saw--

287
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.546
Saw what?

288
00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.048
I don't want to talk about it.

289
00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:56.883
Well. I hope that
diamond around your neck

290
00:11:56.883 --> 00:11:58.635
fits on your finger.

291
00:11:58.635 --> 00:12:00.720
Else. we need to find a bubble
gum machine with a ring to fit.

292
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.180
This was my
grandmother's ring.

293
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.556
She was French.

294
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.558
She's the reason I
love this city so much.

295
00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.434
You know what?

296
00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.144
No. I'm not doing this.

297
00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:09.562
You're going to tell them the
truth because this is wrong.

298
00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.147
Or else I'm going back
to New York today.

299
00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:22.075
Look.

300
00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:23.910
Look. this is what we'll do. OK?

301
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.745
We'll give them
an amazing pitch.

302
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.956
And after they fall
in love with it.

303
00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.749
we'll tell them it was
a misunderstanding.

304
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:30.917
Everybody wins.

305
00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.711
We literally
have no ideas yet.

306
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:35.005
With diamonds. you
just need to think big.

307
00:12:35.005 --> 00:12:37.590
Think models dripping in
diamonds. scaling the Eiffel

308
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.050
Tower.

309
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.428
Sebastian. the greatest
ad campaign in history

310
00:12:41.428 --> 00:12:43.346
was a diamond is forever.

311
00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:44.305
It was simple.

312
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.187
Great. it's Caroline.

313
00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.022
No. I can't do it.

314
00:12:52.022 --> 00:12:52.480
I'm sorry.

315
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.273
Please.

316
00:12:53.273 --> 00:12:55.692
Please just--

317
00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:56.526
Caroline. bonjour.

318
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:57.444
Sa va?

319
00:12:57.444 --> 00:12:58.361
Sebastian?

320
00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.404
Where's Anna?

321
00:12:59.404 --> 00:13:00.488
Anna?

322
00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:02.449
She's. um-- she's in the toilet.

323
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:03.533
OK.

324
00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:04.701
How's it going?

325
00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:06.453
Very well.

326
00:13:06.453 --> 00:13:07.287
They're liking your ideas?

327
00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:08.913
Very much.

328
00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.082
That is a lot of very's.

329
00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:11.958
Is it Anna?

330
00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:14.294
She's stifling your creativity?

331
00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:15.378
No.

332
00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:16.171
Anna's smart.

333
00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:17.297
She's been great.

334
00:13:17.297 --> 00:13:18.381
OK. good.

335
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:19.716
Keep me posted.

336
00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.801
Au revoir.

337
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.928
Wow. stifling your creativity?

338
00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.347
She doesn't think I can do this.

339
00:13:25.347 --> 00:13:26.306
So show her you can.

340
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:30.935
So are you in?

341
00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:35.523
Fine.

342
00:13:35.523 --> 00:13:36.358
Pardon?

343
00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:38.151
Fine. yes. fine.

344
00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.862
The next time Caroline calls.
I'm doing market research.

345
00:13:40.862 --> 00:13:42.405
not on the toilet.

346
00:13:42.405 --> 00:13:45.408
This is very bad karma.

347
00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:47.786
You were great in
Legally Blonde. by the way.

348
00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:08.556
Passports. please.

349
00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:09.224
Merci.

350
00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:15.271
{\an8}Madame
Durand's assistant called.

351
00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:18.692
We have the honeymoon
suite all ready for you.

352
00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:20.944
It's a honeymoon suite?

353
00:14:20.944 --> 00:14:23.238
Is it possible to make that
into two rooms. please?

354
00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:31.079
When you see the romantic
room we have for you.

355
00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:35.208
all your troubles will melt
away. vanish in the wind.

356
00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.876
Did you hear that.
??

357
00:14:36.876 --> 00:14:38.169
That sounds wonderful.

358
00:14:38.169 --> 00:14:39.796
Merci.

359
00:14:39.796 --> 00:14:41.798
My little cabbage?

360
00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.174
It's a term of endearment.

361
00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:50.390
Merci.

362
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.243
Come on.

363
00:15:10.243 --> 00:15:13.872
Oh. you've got
to be kidding me.

364
00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:17.625
Mm. delicious.

365
00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:19.544
You don't snore. do you?

366
00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:23.006
Quickest honeymoon ever.

367
00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:24.591
No. you don't
have to open that.

368
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.467
Oh. relax.

369
00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:26.551
Live a little.

370
00:15:26.551 --> 00:15:28.303
Stop and taste the bubbly.

371
00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:30.930
Now that the client
thinks that we're married.

372
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.432
what's your big idea?

373
00:15:32.432 --> 00:15:34.434
Well. we'll just have
to get to know each other.

374
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.271
No.

375
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:39.481
Maybe not.

376
00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:41.524
You can tell me about
your favorite color.

377
00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.109
your favorite dessert.

378
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.362
You can tell me all about
your paperclip collection.

379
00:15:45.362 --> 00:15:48.656
And then maybe we can
reminisce about our first date.

380
00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.325
I suck at lying.

381
00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:52.994
I get really hot. and
my face turns red.

382
00:15:52.994 --> 00:15:54.788
And I don't know.

383
00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:57.791
Maybe we could just tell them
that we broke up or something.

384
00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.125
What. you mean like a fake-up?

385
00:15:59.125 --> 00:15:59.793
Yes!

386
00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.086
No way.

387
00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:02.629
You know. what's
up with you anyway?

388
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:06.925
What was that Paris honeymoon
you were talking about?

389
00:16:06.925 --> 00:16:09.219
I used to be
married. and then--

390
00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.638
I don't know-- today. I thought
I saw my ex-husband at Durand.

391
00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:12.472
You were married?

392
00:16:12.472 --> 00:16:13.890
When?

393
00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.433
Two years ago. but
it only lasted a year.

394
00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:16.810
What happened?

395
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.687
You are just.
like. prying a lot.

396
00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:19.771
Well. we're married now.

397
00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:20.980
We have no secrets.

398
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:22.315
I thought I was in love.

399
00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:24.109
So I got married very quickly.

400
00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:26.569
It's just. it wasn't me.

401
00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:27.821
Oh?

402
00:16:27.821 --> 00:16:28.988
Yes. being back
here just reminds

403
00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:31.366
me of what an epic
failure that was.

404
00:16:31.366 --> 00:16:36.413
Anna. divorce doesn't
mean you failed.

405
00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:37.956
Look at you.

406
00:16:37.956 --> 00:16:40.458
You're pitching on a
huge account. flown

407
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.877
across the world. trusted
with one of the biggest gets

408
00:16:42.877 --> 00:16:44.838
Dash might have this year.

409
00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.507
Believe me. I know
what it is to fail.

410
00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:50.385
That's why we need to knock
this pitch out of the park.

411
00:16:57.767 --> 00:17:05.525
What about Paris Rocks?

412
00:17:05.525 --> 00:17:06.693
Eh.

413
00:17:06.693 --> 00:17:10.655
Sounds like a bad '80s band.

414
00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.365
What about Paris Eternal?

415
00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:15.201
Sounds like you're selling
tickets to the catacomb.

416
00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.167
You know what?

417
00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:26.129
I need to clear my head.

418
00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:30.800
Let's. um-- let's
get some rest. huh?

419
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.511
Yeah. my head is pounding.

420
00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:34.596
Definitely jet lagged.

421
00:17:40.143 --> 00:17:46.316
{\an8}You know. my grandmother
used to say. [speaking french]...

422
00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:05.543
Favorite color is blush pink.

423
00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:09.839
I like black raspberry
ice cream from back home.

424
00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:16.596
And my perfect date would be
a walk on the Alexandre III

425
00:18:53.591 --> 00:18:54.217
Ugh.

426
00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:02.350
So gross.

427
00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:14.195
Morning.

428
00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.864
Peace offering.

429
00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:17.532
I'm sorry.

430
00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.200
All of this has just put me
out of my comfort zone. so.

431
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.453
I've hit a bit
of a wall myself.

432
00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:23.371
Anything come to
you in your dreams?

433
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.875
Oh. yeah. I was
fired in two languages.

434
00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:29.711
But luckily. we get three hours
to figure all of this stuff

435
00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:31.463
out.

436
00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:31.963
Shall we?

437
00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:42.223
Bonjour.

438
00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:43.141
Marianne.

439
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:44.059
Sebastian. bonjour.

440
00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:45.060
Bonjour.

441
00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.687
Bonjour. hi.

442
00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:50.565
Bonjour.

443
00:19:50.565 --> 00:19:51.900
Gabriel.

444
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.610
Sebastian.

445
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.402
Long time.

446
00:19:57.197 --> 00:20:00.075
Gabriel works for
France's top ad agency. Idé.

447
00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:01.368
Hm.

448
00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.786
He's a drones ad
exec here in Paris.

449
00:20:02.786 --> 00:20:04.704
This is Anna Bowman.

450
00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:05.914
Nice to meet you. Anna.

451
00:20:05.914 --> 00:20:07.582
You. too.

452
00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:09.834
Gabriel is going to consult
on the American campaign.

453
00:20:09.834 --> 00:20:11.461
Oh.

454
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.546
Yes. I told Marianne.
Louis. my agency can handle

455
00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:17.717
the launch ourselves. but they
insisted on an American agency

456
00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:18.843
taking the lead.

457
00:20:18.843 --> 00:20:20.512
You know the American market?

458
00:20:20.512 --> 00:20:23.473
We have a few
international clients. yes.

459
00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:28.436
And rest assured. we have
many great ideas ready to go.

460
00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:31.147
Like?

461
00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:35.026
Well. the American agencies
get so wrapped up in proposals.

462
00:20:35.026 --> 00:20:39.781
We want to promote more than
the classic engagement ring--

463
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:43.618
anniversaries. birthdays.
Valentine's Day.

464
00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:48.206
Durand Diamond makes
any event special.

465
00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:53.420
And that approach has worked for
us like a charm here in Europe.

466
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.338
Well. you don't
want to underestimate

467
00:20:55.338 --> 00:20:56.798
the power of the proposal.

468
00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:59.634
We spend $30 billion a
year on engagement rings.

469
00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:01.553
That's more than
any other country.

470
00:21:01.553 --> 00:21:04.431
I would say saying yes is
all about the four c's--

471
00:21:04.431 --> 00:21:07.642
color. cut. clarity.
and. of course. carat.

472
00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:10.437
Yes. and let us not
forget the fifth C--

473
00:21:10.437 --> 00:21:14.566
see how fast she can
post it on social media.

474
00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:17.569
Little bit gauche.
don't you think?

475
00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:19.487
60% of American
women say that they've

476
00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:23.324
posted their engagement ring
within the first 24 hours

477
00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:26.036
and nearly 90% within
the first week.

478
00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:28.747
That is a promotional gold mine.

479
00:21:28.747 --> 00:21:31.166
You can only make a
first impression once.

480
00:21:31.166 --> 00:21:33.501
I would say go with what works.

481
00:21:33.501 --> 00:21:34.586
Come.

482
00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:35.545
Let's hear your
pitch in the office.

483
00:21:42.552 --> 00:21:46.348
We see an American couple at
a romantic picnic with champagne

484
00:21:46.348 --> 00:21:48.308
in front of the Eiffel Tower.

485
00:21:48.308 --> 00:21:50.518
He gives her a pink
box and reminds her

486
00:21:50.518 --> 00:21:52.979
that it's been one year
since their first date.

487
00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:56.524
Yes. and with anticipation.
she opens this box.

488
00:21:56.524 --> 00:21:59.069
Inside. some macarons.

489
00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:03.239
She's not overly impressed.
so he gives her another box.

490
00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:04.491
A little beret.

491
00:22:04.491 --> 00:22:06.326
Again. not impressed.

492
00:22:06.326 --> 00:22:09.079
But this time. he
gets down on one knee

493
00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:10.955
and presents a tiny box.

494
00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:15.043
Her face lights up to reveal
a dazzling Durand Diamond

495
00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:16.336
engagement ring.

496
00:22:16.336 --> 00:22:18.463
Give your love
a piece of Paris.

497
00:22:18.463 --> 00:22:19.589
Durand Diamonds.

498
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.016
I'm not sure it
really captured

499
00:22:30.016 --> 00:22:31.559
the essence of the brand.

500
00:22:31.559 --> 00:22:36.398
It's a little predictable.

501
00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:40.360
Yes. it's a little--
how do you say--

502
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.569
pedestrian.

503
00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:42.862
And you're-- how
do you say-- an--

504
00:22:42.862 --> 00:22:44.698
We can come up with
something better.

505
00:22:44.698 --> 00:22:47.242
Yes. and if you
don't. my agency

506
00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:50.412
will be happy to take
over the campaign.

507
00:22:50.412 --> 00:22:53.748
I'm sorry. but I have to run.

508
00:22:53.748 --> 00:22:56.209
Marianne. I will see you
this evening at the gala.

509
00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:58.753
Of course.

510
00:22:58.753 --> 00:22:59.963
Louis.

511
00:22:59.963 --> 00:23:00.839
I'll walk you out.

512
00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:08.555
So. Andre at the hotel.
he told my assistant

513
00:23:08.555 --> 00:23:10.140
you had a little tiff.

514
00:23:10.932 --> 00:23:11.766
Oh.

515
00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:13.268
Oh. no. no. no.

516
00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:14.978
It was nothing.

517
00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:18.064
She was. oh. as they say in
America. hangry. weren't you.

518
00:23:18.064 --> 00:23:19.816
my love?

519
00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:20.900
Yes.

520
00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.318
Yes. I was.

521
00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:24.279
Well. sometimes
relationship can be difficult.

522
00:23:24.279 --> 00:23:25.447
Oh. no. no. we are good.

523
00:23:25.447 --> 00:23:27.365
We are burning.

524
00:23:27.365 --> 00:23:28.241
We're burning up.

525
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:30.452
We are burning up.

526
00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:33.997
Why don't you take some
time to explore the city

527
00:23:33.997 --> 00:23:38.877
to breathe in the romance
and the essence of Durand?

528
00:23:38.877 --> 00:23:41.796
I'm sure it will give
idea for the campaign.

529
00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:42.839
We're--

530
00:23:42.839 --> 00:23:44.341
She's right. ...

531
00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:46.301
We'll stay as long
as you need. madame.

532
00:23:46.301 --> 00:23:47.844
Good.

533
00:23:47.844 --> 00:23:50.430
Then you can come to the
gala as my special guest.

534
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.181
It's perfect.

535
00:23:51.181 --> 00:23:52.599
Perfect.

536
00:23:52.599 --> 00:23:55.393
Oh. and I want to
hear all about your love

537
00:23:55.393 --> 00:23:57.979
story. every detail.

538
00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:04.402
Every detail--
are you kidding me?

539
00:24:04.402 --> 00:24:05.487
We're here for a few days.

540
00:24:05.487 --> 00:24:07.489
Just relax. OK?

541
00:24:21.252 --> 00:24:23.672
I never took you
for a photographer.

542
00:24:23.672 --> 00:24:24.881
Oh?

543
00:24:24.881 --> 00:24:26.841
I mean. I guess I
kind of fell into it.

544
00:24:26.841 --> 00:24:29.052
I used to help my mom and
dad with their old print shop

545
00:24:29.052 --> 00:24:33.098
back in Ohio or take photographs
of local ad campaigns.

546
00:24:33.098 --> 00:24:35.725
So that's how you
got into advertising?

547
00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:36.226
Yeah.

548
00:24:42.941 --> 00:24:46.403
Love is the one thing we all
have in common in this world.

549
00:24:46.403 --> 00:24:49.614
Well. that and heartbreak.

550
00:24:49.614 --> 00:24:51.866
It's a bit cynical. no?

551
00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:52.283
I guess.

552
00:24:57.122 --> 00:24:58.248
A beautiful new life.

553
00:25:02.544 --> 00:25:05.046
Or the beginning of the end.

554
00:25:05.046 --> 00:25:06.881
See. the thing is.
when we're little.

555
00:25:06.881 --> 00:25:09.509
we're promised this fairy tale.
but what we're not promised

556
00:25:09.509 --> 00:25:10.969
is a happy ending.

557
00:25:10.969 --> 00:25:15.098
Well. we won't share
that with Durand.

558
00:25:15.098 --> 00:25:18.059
I'm sorry it didn't
work out for you.

559
00:25:18.059 --> 00:25:19.894
Thank you.

560
00:25:19.894 --> 00:25:21.521
Honestly. I never
thought I'd be back

561
00:25:21.521 --> 00:25:23.064
in Paris as a married woman.

562
00:25:23.064 --> 00:25:25.734
Well. with
so charming and handsome

563
00:25:25.734 --> 00:25:27.986
a husband. you may never
want to let him go.

564
00:25:27.986 --> 00:25:29.612
Wow.

565
00:25:29.612 --> 00:25:33.575
All right. Prince
Charming. where to next?

566
00:25:33.575 --> 00:25:35.368
This. I miss--

567
00:25:35.368 --> 00:25:40.081
the streets of Paris. the way
the light shines and beams.

568
00:25:40.081 --> 00:25:40.957
It sparkles.

569
00:25:40.957 --> 00:25:42.334
It is magnifique.

570
00:25:42.334 --> 00:25:44.502
OK. let's focus.

571
00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:45.837
What is our pitch?

572
00:25:45.837 --> 00:25:47.797
Anna. please.
this is how I work.

573
00:25:47.797 --> 00:25:49.591
Let your imagination go free.

574
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:51.217
OK. I get that
you want to daydream

575
00:25:51.217 --> 00:25:54.304
about a sparkly street. but
we really do have deadlines.

576
00:25:54.304 --> 00:25:55.597
and I take those very seriously.

577
00:25:55.597 --> 00:25:56.598
Anna. all right.

578
00:25:56.598 --> 00:25:58.641
It's a process.

579
00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:00.393
You're too uptight.

580
00:26:00.393 --> 00:26:01.770
Wow.

581
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.271
Well. you know. you're
too undisciplined.

582
00:26:03.271 --> 00:26:06.066
Can't you let yourself
loosen up. even for a moment?

583
00:26:06.066 --> 00:26:09.277
To be outrageous. to have
fun. to let yourself think?

584
00:26:09.277 --> 00:26:11.446
I have fun.

585
00:26:11.446 --> 00:26:12.447
You see him?

586
00:26:12.447 --> 00:26:13.698
You're like that.

587
00:26:13.698 --> 00:26:14.616
You're stuck in a box.

588
00:26:14.616 --> 00:26:16.076
I'm not stuck in a box.

589
00:26:16.076 --> 00:26:17.452
Yes. you are.

590
00:26:17.452 --> 00:26:20.205
The deadlines. the
schedules-- it's boring.

591
00:26:20.205 --> 00:26:21.289
I enjoy my life.

592
00:26:21.289 --> 00:26:22.165
I have fun.

593
00:26:22.165 --> 00:26:22.791
Oh. really?

594
00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:25.418
Yes.

595
00:26:25.418 --> 00:26:26.586
Prove it.

596
00:26:26.586 --> 00:26:28.004
Prove what?

597
00:26:30.507 --> 00:26:32.092
What are you doing?

598
00:26:32.092 --> 00:26:34.135
I'm having fun.

599
00:26:34.135 --> 00:26:36.054
Please. no. stop.

600
00:26:36.054 --> 00:26:37.389
Please stop.

601
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:38.765
This is so embarrassing.

602
00:26:42.977 --> 00:26:43.728
I'm leaving.

603
00:26:43.728 --> 00:26:45.230
Set your inner child free.

604
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.980
No. I'm leaving.

605
00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.190
Bye.

606
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.650
Or have you forgotten
what she looks like?

607
00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.152
I'm not leaving until
you get up here.

608
00:26:51.152 --> 00:26:52.153
Oh.

609
00:26:52.153 --> 00:26:53.196
I'm not doing that?

610
00:26:57.367 --> 00:26:59.536
Tres bien.

611
00:26:59.536 --> 00:27:00.161
Ready?

612
00:27:00.161 --> 00:27:00.620
Yes.

613
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.204
Ready?

614
00:27:01.204 --> 00:27:01.830
OK.

615
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:02.330
Oh.

616
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.956
No. no. no.

617
00:27:02.956 --> 00:27:03.498
Oh.

618
00:27:03.498 --> 00:27:04.290
No. no. no. no.

619
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:05.333
Stuck in a box.

620
00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:05.750
Anna. take it seriously. OK?

621
00:27:10.088 --> 00:27:10.755
Tres bien.

622
00:27:18.596 --> 00:27:20.098
I'm sorry.

623
00:27:20.098 --> 00:27:20.682
OK. we gotta go.

624
00:27:20.682 --> 00:27:21.808
Ah. da-da-da.

625
00:27:24.394 --> 00:27:25.729
Thank you.

626
00:27:25.729 --> 00:27:28.064
Oh.

627
00:27:28.064 --> 00:27:29.107
Tres bien.

628
00:27:36.698 --> 00:27:38.324
I told you I can have fun.

629
00:27:38.324 --> 00:27:40.035
I'm an excellent mime.

630
00:27:43.913 --> 00:27:46.499
OK. OK. now it's
time to focus.

631
00:27:46.499 --> 00:27:49.336
I'm always focused.

632
00:27:49.336 --> 00:27:53.006
I'll have a chai tea latte.
three pumps. skim milk.

633
00:27:53.006 --> 00:27:56.343
light water. no
foam. 120 degrees.

634
00:27:56.343 --> 00:27:57.427
Merci.

635
00:27:57.427 --> 00:27:58.803
I will just have another tea.

636
00:27:58.803 --> 00:28:00.805
Merci.

637
00:28:00.805 --> 00:28:02.474
Does anybody ever
get that order right?

638
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:08.188
OK. um. I know that we
could do a little butter--

639
00:28:08.188 --> 00:28:09.898
better.

640
00:28:09.898 --> 00:28:11.149
I'm sorry. you just-- you
know that there are already

641
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:12.942
27 layers of butter
on a croissant. right?

642
00:28:12.942 --> 00:28:14.527
27 layers of heaven.

643
00:28:17.614 --> 00:28:18.990
Oh. that's nice.

644
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.535
Yeah. she looks really sweet.

645
00:28:22.535 --> 00:28:24.704
That's how you
conduct research.

646
00:28:24.704 --> 00:28:25.538
You observe.

647
00:28:25.538 --> 00:28:27.123
You take it all in.

648
00:28:27.123 --> 00:28:29.167
You have a real eye for this.

649
00:28:29.167 --> 00:28:31.127
Did you know that
one in 500 proposals

650
00:28:31.127 --> 00:28:33.213
happens right here in Paris?

651
00:28:33.213 --> 00:28:35.548
And of course. a lot of them
at the most popular spot.

652
00:28:35.548 --> 00:28:36.549
the Eiffel Tower.

653
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:38.593
Well. it's the best view.

654
00:28:38.593 --> 00:28:40.720
These are my grandparents.
Harold and Claudette.

655
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.014
who were engaged here in Paris.

656
00:28:43.014 --> 00:28:44.808
It was right after World War II.

657
00:28:44.808 --> 00:28:46.976
And. well. he was
an American soldier.

658
00:28:46.976 --> 00:28:48.728
She was a French seamstress.

659
00:28:48.728 --> 00:28:51.272
You look just like her.

660
00:28:51.272 --> 00:28:51.981
Beautiful.

661
00:28:54.818 --> 00:28:56.653
Any chance you'd like
to have dinner tonight?

662
00:28:56.653 --> 00:28:59.948
I know this great spot in
the Latin Quarter. great wine

663
00:28:59.948 --> 00:29:02.200
and great people watching.

664
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:02.701
Anna!

665
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:03.410
Research.

666
00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:03.785
Hi!

667
00:29:03.785 --> 00:29:04.536
Anna!

668
00:29:04.536 --> 00:29:05.161
Sebastian.

669
00:29:05.161 --> 00:29:05.745
Anna. hi!

670
00:29:05.745 --> 00:29:07.455
Lily!

671
00:29:07.455 --> 00:29:08.540
Hi!

672
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.749
Oh. it's good to see you.

673
00:29:09.749 --> 00:29:11.793
This is Sebastian.

674
00:29:11.793 --> 00:29:14.295
Lily. this is our
creative director.

675
00:29:14.295 --> 00:29:15.171
Nice to meet you.

676
00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:15.755
Enchante.

677
00:29:15.755 --> 00:29:17.215
Here. sit down.

678
00:29:17.215 --> 00:29:19.592
I got your rescue
text. but you seem great.

679
00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:20.343
Wow.

680
00:29:20.343 --> 00:29:20.927
Rescue text?

681
00:29:20.927 --> 00:29:22.637
Thanks for that.

682
00:29:22.637 --> 00:29:25.348
Yes. it's-- I just figured
with everything happening with

683
00:29:25.348 --> 00:29:28.143
the hotel. it would just be
better if I stayed with Lily.

684
00:29:28.143 --> 00:29:29.602
What if Marianne finds out?

685
00:29:29.602 --> 00:29:30.478
She won't.

686
00:29:30.478 --> 00:29:31.187
This is a bad idea.

687
00:29:31.187 --> 00:29:31.771
I'm sorry.

688
00:29:31.771 --> 00:29:33.773
What's going on?

689
00:29:33.773 --> 00:29:35.191
Look. it's kind
of a crazy story.

690
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:36.651
and I will explain
everything later.

691
00:29:36.651 --> 00:29:39.362
But basically. the Durands
think that we are married.

692
00:29:39.362 --> 00:29:41.031
Oh.

693
00:29:41.031 --> 00:29:42.323
And now we have a week to
come up with a brilliant idea.

694
00:29:42.323 --> 00:29:45.785
OK. well. let me know
if you need my help.

695
00:29:45.785 --> 00:29:48.288
I run the social
media for chic we

696
00:29:48.288 --> 00:29:51.916
make designer gear for all of
Europe's most pampered pooches.

697
00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:53.418
Here. I'll show you.

698
00:29:53.418 --> 00:29:56.296
Puppy couture.
encrusted collars.

699
00:29:56.296 --> 00:29:57.172
Wow.

700
00:29:57.172 --> 00:29:58.465
Isn't that beautiful?

701
00:29:58.465 --> 00:29:59.424
Mm-hmm.

702
00:29:59.424 --> 00:30:01.343
And then-- oh. paw-fume.

703
00:30:01.343 --> 00:30:05.138
Well.
it's a dog's life.

704
00:30:05.138 --> 00:30:08.641
That's funny.

705
00:30:08.641 --> 00:30:09.976
He's funny.

706
00:30:09.976 --> 00:30:11.644
Do you want something
to drink or eat?

707
00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:12.937
Sure. yeah. what
are you having?

708
00:30:12.937 --> 00:30:14.647
Don't ask.

709
00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:16.608
27 layers of heaven.

710
00:30:26.868 --> 00:30:28.995
OK. I will see
you in the morning.

711
00:30:28.995 --> 00:30:29.788
Monsieur. hello.

712
00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:32.957
Oh. hello.

713
00:30:32.957 --> 00:30:34.000
Marianne's here.

714
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.709
Marianne's here!

715
00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.428
Anna. are you going somewhere?

716
00:30:45.428 --> 00:30:48.014
No.

717
00:30:48.014 --> 00:30:48.723
Here you go.

718
00:30:48.723 --> 00:30:49.349
Hm?

719
00:30:49.349 --> 00:30:49.808
Lily.

720
00:30:49.808 --> 00:30:50.600
Mm!

721
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.685
Oh. thank you.

722
00:30:51.685 --> 00:30:53.645
Thank you for my suitcase.

723
00:30:53.645 --> 00:30:54.396
Mm-hmm.

724
00:30:54.396 --> 00:30:55.397
Hi.

725
00:30:55.397 --> 00:30:56.606
I'm Lily.

726
00:30:56.606 --> 00:30:59.109
I'm Anna's friend from America.

727
00:30:59.109 --> 00:31:00.485
Enchante. Lily.

728
00:31:00.485 --> 00:31:02.487
She's checking in
today at the hotel.

729
00:31:02.487 --> 00:31:07.117
Well. since you are in Paris.
you must come to our gala.

730
00:31:07.117 --> 00:31:08.743
I would love
to. Madame Durand.

731
00:31:08.743 --> 00:31:09.911
Merci.

732
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:11.705
Anyway. yeah. I should go.

733
00:31:11.705 --> 00:31:14.207
I'm going to leave the
keys at the front desk. OK?

734
00:31:14.207 --> 00:31:15.375
OK.

735
00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:20.630
I believe the front
desk is that way.

736
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:21.965
Of course it is.

737
00:31:21.965 --> 00:31:22.716
Thank you.

738
00:31:22.716 --> 00:31:23.299
Thank you. guys.

739
00:31:23.299 --> 00:31:25.135
OK.

740
00:31:25.135 --> 00:31:27.887
Well. how are things going?

741
00:31:27.887 --> 00:31:28.680
Well--

742
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.389
It's wonderful.

743
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.848
Great.

744
00:31:29.848 --> 00:31:31.224
Wonderful.

745
00:31:31.224 --> 00:31:33.393
I mean. today. we
learned how to mime.

746
00:31:33.393 --> 00:31:34.102
Yes. it was--

747
00:31:34.102 --> 00:31:36.146
Oh. that's wonderful.

748
00:31:36.146 --> 00:31:40.275
I am so happy you are
enjoying second honeymoon.

749
00:31:40.275 --> 00:31:42.068
You are married. Sebastian?

750
00:31:42.068 --> 00:31:45.280
They are celebrating
their first anniversary.

751
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.073
Well. we don't
want to keep you.

752
00:31:47.073 --> 00:31:49.325
No. we have a meeting.

753
00:31:49.325 --> 00:31:52.245
But I am very excited
to hear your ideas.

754
00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:56.916
Now will you listen to me?

755
00:31:56.916 --> 00:31:57.917
I didn't know she was--

756
00:31:57.917 --> 00:32:00.795
Hello. my favorite couple.

757
00:32:00.795 --> 00:32:03.298
Oh. you look terrible.

758
00:32:03.298 --> 00:32:04.966
Have you thought about
a couple's massage?

759
00:32:04.966 --> 00:32:06.343
You know what?

760
00:32:06.343 --> 00:32:07.927
I think my beautiful
bride could use one.

761
00:32:07.927 --> 00:32:09.429
She needs to relax.

762
00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:11.806
Actually. we have
a lot of work to do.

763
00:32:11.806 --> 00:32:13.183
Right. honey?

764
00:32:13.183 --> 00:32:17.645
And what about our
lover cake for lovers?

765
00:32:17.645 --> 00:32:18.772
Chocolate fixes everything.

766
00:32:18.772 --> 00:32:19.481
We're not--

767
00:32:19.481 --> 00:32:20.440
Delicious.

768
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.608
Send one up.

769
00:32:21.608 --> 00:32:22.650
Consider it delivered.

770
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:23.276
Mm.

771
00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:27.822
You're just really milking
this thing. aren't you?

772
00:32:27.822 --> 00:32:29.199
I would.

773
00:32:29.199 --> 00:32:32.035
Like I'm going to
turn down chocolate.

774
00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:32.911
Come along. my love.

775
00:32:46.675 --> 00:32:49.469
So what's the deal
with that Gabriel guy?

776
00:32:49.469 --> 00:32:50.345
He seems so--

777
00:32:50.345 --> 00:32:51.763
I don't know-- prickly.

778
00:32:51.763 --> 00:32:53.848
Oh. he's like a cactus.

779
00:32:53.848 --> 00:32:56.685
He's always been
competitive with me.

780
00:32:56.685 --> 00:32:58.853
His firm's had my family's
account for years.

781
00:32:58.853 --> 00:33:00.230
And when I was VP
of marketing. we

782
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.983
used to butt heads
on everything.

783
00:33:03.983 --> 00:33:07.404
What happened with
the department store?

784
00:33:07.404 --> 00:33:09.572
I mean. Marianne said
something about your parents.

785
00:33:09.572 --> 00:33:10.323
and it just--

786
00:33:12.742 --> 00:33:17.706
Well. Laurent has
always been a French icon.

787
00:33:17.706 --> 00:33:22.168
But it was struggling to
attract young customers.

788
00:33:22.168 --> 00:33:24.754
Well. I wanted to take it
into an edgier direction.

789
00:33:24.754 --> 00:33:28.842
show my father I could make
a difference with my ideas.

790
00:33:28.842 --> 00:33:30.010
So what happened?

791
00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:36.558
Well. it backfired literally.

792
00:33:36.558 --> 00:33:37.559
There was a fire.

793
00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:40.729
Sorry.
I shouldn't laugh.

794
00:33:40.729 --> 00:33:42.522
I just-- what?

795
00:33:42.522 --> 00:33:44.274
It's never to be
spoken of again.

796
00:33:44.274 --> 00:33:51.531
but my brother and my father
blamed me. and rightly so.

797
00:33:51.531 --> 00:33:53.074
Is that why you
moved to New York?

798
00:33:53.074 --> 00:33:55.076
Not right away.

799
00:33:55.076 --> 00:33:58.038
My father stepped
down a year later.

800
00:33:58.038 --> 00:34:00.457
He asked Marcel to
run the company.

801
00:34:00.457 --> 00:34:02.625
Said he was the responsible one.

802
00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:07.505
So I went to New York.
far away from my family.

803
00:34:07.505 --> 00:34:09.674
You probably
already know this.

804
00:34:09.674 --> 00:34:14.596
but you're really
good at what you do.

805
00:34:14.596 --> 00:34:16.806
Thank you.

806
00:34:31.571 --> 00:34:32.572
Ugh.

807
00:34:32.572 --> 00:34:34.324
Call it a towel
rack for a reason.

808
00:34:49.297 --> 00:34:51.633
They make it look
so easy. don't they?

809
00:34:51.633 --> 00:34:54.219
Well. if it's right.
it should be easy. no?

810
00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:56.805
Coming from the single man.

811
00:34:56.805 --> 00:34:59.599
No. it's not as easy as
faking being married.

812
00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:02.686
I'm not even sure I
want to get married.

813
00:35:02.686 --> 00:35:03.978
Why?

814
00:35:03.978 --> 00:35:05.939
You'd be tied
down. not to mention

815
00:35:05.939 --> 00:35:08.108
the family can let you down.

816
00:35:08.108 --> 00:35:09.609
Oh. that sounds familiar.

817
00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:11.069
You're comparing
me to your ex?

818
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:12.821
Yes. I am.

819
00:35:12.821 --> 00:35:16.700
You both use towels as carpets
and toothpaste as finger paint.

820
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.451
I don't understand.

821
00:35:18.451 --> 00:35:21.830
If it was so wrong. why did you
get married in the first place?

822
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.164
I don't know.

823
00:35:23.164 --> 00:35:24.499
We just kind of fell
into the romance.

824
00:35:24.499 --> 00:35:25.500
I mean. it wasn't love.

825
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.793
It was definitely just lust.

826
00:35:26.793 --> 00:35:27.627
You said yes. huh?

827
00:35:27.627 --> 00:35:28.420
Yeah.

828
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.295
Where was your research?

829
00:35:29.295 --> 00:35:30.547
Oh. my research.

830
00:35:30.547 --> 00:35:31.840
Uh. yeah.

831
00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.258
I don't know.

832
00:35:33.258 --> 00:35:34.551
He definitely didn't
fit my dating algorithm.

833
00:35:34.551 --> 00:35:35.719
Seriously?

834
00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:36.720
Yeah.

835
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.388
Well. it's an app.

836
00:35:38.388 --> 00:35:40.807
Wow. do not judge.

837
00:35:40.807 --> 00:35:44.352
If you were to propose.
how would you do it?

838
00:35:44.352 --> 00:35:47.063
I'd have my Durand Diamond
engagement ring in my hand.

839
00:35:47.063 --> 00:35:47.689
of course.

840
00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:48.314
Of course.

841
00:35:48.314 --> 00:35:49.441
Yeah. of course.

842
00:35:49.441 --> 00:35:52.569
I would get down on one knee.

843
00:35:52.569 --> 00:35:53.319
I would--

844
00:35:53.319 --> 00:35:53.987
Oh. we're doing this.

845
00:35:53.987 --> 00:35:55.572
OK.

846
00:35:55.572 --> 00:35:57.866
I'd tell you how crazy
you make me. which you do.

847
00:35:57.866 --> 00:35:59.659
Mm.

848
00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:04.664
And I'd tell you how I haven't
been happier in a long time.

849
00:36:04.664 --> 00:36:10.920
And-- and then I'd
quickly come to my senses.

850
00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.006
I'd break out into a cold sweat.

851
00:36:13.006 --> 00:36:14.090
Oh!

852
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:14.924
Sorry.

853
00:36:14.924 --> 00:36:15.633
I'm so sorry.

854
00:36:15.633 --> 00:36:16.176
No. that's--

855
00:36:16.176 --> 00:36:17.135
I'm so sorry.

856
00:36:17.135 --> 00:36:17.677
That's fine. really.

857
00:36:17.677 --> 00:36:18.678
It was--

858
00:36:18.678 --> 00:36:19.220
Because it was
just an accident.

859
00:36:20.555 --> 00:36:22.057
You did not just do that.

860
00:36:22.057 --> 00:36:23.892
I did.

861
00:36:23.892 --> 00:36:25.685
Merci beaucoup. huh?

862
00:36:25.685 --> 00:36:27.354
Merci beaucoup.

863
00:36:27.354 --> 00:36:28.563
When in Paris.

864
00:36:28.563 --> 00:36:29.981
I told you. being
married sucks.

865
00:36:35.737 --> 00:36:38.531
Thankfully it's not
actually Paris Fashion Week.

866
00:36:38.531 --> 00:36:41.034
Marie Antoinette would
be rolling in her grave.

867
00:36:41.034 --> 00:36:41.910
She would be.

868
00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:48.458
I'm going to get this.

869
00:36:53.046 --> 00:36:54.881
Another epic proposal.

870
00:36:54.881 --> 00:37:00.345
Yes. Paris. home of
the cliches and berets.

871
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.953
Hello?

872
00:37:24.953 --> 00:37:27.539
Is Sebastian there?

873
00:37:27.539 --> 00:37:29.290
I'm sorry. who's this?

874
00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:32.085
Sebastian's mother.

875
00:37:32.085 --> 00:37:33.253
Hi.

876
00:37:33.253 --> 00:37:37.382
Um. he's doing market research.

877
00:37:37.382 --> 00:37:38.967
Oh. please. could you

878
00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:42.846
tell my son I expect him
home in the morning tomorrow?

879
00:37:42.846 --> 00:37:44.848
Yeah. of course.

880
00:37:44.848 --> 00:37:47.100
Yes. I can.

881
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.268
Um--

882
00:37:48.268 --> 00:37:49.310
Are you OK?

883
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:50.228
Yes. I'm fine.

884
00:37:50.228 --> 00:37:52.439
I will let him know.

885
00:37:52.439 --> 00:37:54.566
Well.
I'm looking forward

886
00:37:54.566 --> 00:37:57.485
to meet you. and
see you tomorrow.

887
00:38:00.405 --> 00:38:01.489
Sebastian!

888
00:38:04.993 --> 00:38:06.661
Hey?

889
00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:10.290
Um. your mom just
called the hotel room.

890
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:13.168
and she wants to see
you and me tomorrow.

891
00:38:13.168 --> 00:38:13.793
Maman?

892
00:38:13.793 --> 00:38:15.003
Yes.

893
00:38:15.003 --> 00:38:16.671
Do you think she knows
about our marriage?

894
00:38:16.671 --> 00:38:18.173
Gabriel.

895
00:38:18.173 --> 00:38:19.299
He must have told my brother.

896
00:38:19.299 --> 00:38:21.593
Him and Marcel are friends.

897
00:38:21.593 --> 00:38:22.969
OK. OK. you know what?

898
00:38:22.969 --> 00:38:24.346
This is good.

899
00:38:24.346 --> 00:38:25.180
Tomorrow you'll go to
your family's house.

900
00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.181
You'll work things out.

901
00:38:26.181 --> 00:38:26.848
And I'll just get work done.

902
00:38:26.848 --> 00:38:28.058
Da-da-da.

903
00:38:28.058 --> 00:38:29.142
You're coming with me.

904
00:38:29.142 --> 00:38:30.018
No.

905
00:38:30.018 --> 00:38:30.685
Yes.

906
00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.065
We're married.

907
00:38:46.534 --> 00:38:47.869
Time to meet the parents.

908
00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.791
Sebastian?

909
00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:55.293
Lucie.

910
00:38:55.293 --> 00:38:57.003
Bonjour. Sebastian.

911
00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.470
This is Anna.

912
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:06.471
Bonjour. Lucie.

913
00:39:06.471 --> 00:39:08.598
Bonjour. Anna.

914
00:39:15.939 --> 00:39:18.233
Sebastian!

915
00:39:18.233 --> 00:39:20.443
{\an8}Maman.

916
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.285
Anna. welcome.

917
00:39:29.285 --> 00:39:30.704
Hello.

918
00:39:43.216 --> 00:39:46.678
So you met at the agency?

919
00:39:46.678 --> 00:39:48.930
Well. Anna is my
account manager.

920
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:50.348
Yes. I am.

921
00:39:50.348 --> 00:39:51.182
Oh.

922
00:39:51.182 --> 00:39:52.350
Merci. Lucie.

923
00:39:53.852 --> 00:39:56.354
Your son is very talented.

924
00:39:56.354 --> 00:39:58.106
I hope you have--

925
00:39:58.106 --> 00:40:00.066
what is it called--

926
00:40:00.066 --> 00:40:02.318
911 on speed dial.

927
00:40:02.318 --> 00:40:03.486
Jacques.

928
00:40:03.486 --> 00:40:08.533
So something you
want to tell us?

929
00:40:08.533 --> 00:40:10.869
You are married.

930
00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:12.370
Yes.

931
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.205
Gabriel told your brother.

932
00:40:14.205 --> 00:40:15.373
Of course he did.

933
00:40:15.373 --> 00:40:19.377
It's a bit of a mix-up.

934
00:40:19.377 --> 00:40:20.962
A mix-up?

935
00:40:20.962 --> 00:40:23.381
Well. either you are
married or you're not.

936
00:40:23.381 --> 00:40:26.551
We-- we--

937
00:40:26.551 --> 00:40:27.927
We are.

938
00:40:27.927 --> 00:40:30.764
We are married. very married.

939
00:40:30.764 --> 00:40:32.932
That's wonderful.

940
00:40:32.932 --> 00:40:36.728
So how
did you propose. Sebastian?

941
00:40:36.728 --> 00:40:43.276
Well. we got black raspberry
ice cream. her favorite.

942
00:40:43.276 --> 00:40:44.903
It's delicious.

943
00:40:44.903 --> 00:40:47.614
And we went to the top of
the Empire State Building.

944
00:40:47.614 --> 00:40:51.076
She had been wildly in
love with me for months.

945
00:40:51.076 --> 00:40:53.244
Well. something I
learned about Sebastian

946
00:40:53.244 --> 00:40:56.414
was that he is
terrified of heights.

947
00:40:56.414 --> 00:40:57.916
I mean. just freaking out.

948
00:40:57.916 --> 00:40:59.876
I had to pull him
out of the elevator.

949
00:40:59.876 --> 00:41:01.419
Children were laughing at him.

950
00:41:01.419 --> 00:41:04.547
I didn't know you were
afraid of heights. Sebastian.

951
00:41:04.547 --> 00:41:07.092
But he's very much
afraid of dolls.

952
00:41:07.092 --> 00:41:07.842
Dolls.

953
00:41:07.842 --> 00:41:08.968
You're afraid of dolls.

954
00:41:08.968 --> 00:41:10.595
Well. I was just
nervous because I

955
00:41:10.595 --> 00:41:12.263
was about to make the
ultimate commitment.

956
00:41:12.263 --> 00:41:13.098
Hmm.

957
00:41:13.098 --> 00:41:15.600
His other fear.

958
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.435
But you should have seen Anna.

959
00:41:17.435 --> 00:41:19.270
She was totally--

960
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:22.148
---
inflated. but puffy.

961
00:41:22.148 --> 00:41:23.358
She looked like--

962
00:41:23.358 --> 00:41:25.610
- a clown. no?

963
00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:30.281
But then I told her
that coming to America

964
00:41:30.281 --> 00:41:35.328
was the best decision I
ever made because. well. it

965
00:41:35.328 --> 00:41:36.913
led me to her.

966
00:41:36.913 --> 00:41:39.457
We are so happy
for both of you.

967
00:41:39.457 --> 00:41:41.167
Aren't we. Jacques?

968
00:41:41.167 --> 00:41:43.545
It seems America has been
good for you. Sebastian.

969
00:41:43.545 --> 00:41:44.754
Congratulations.

970
00:41:44.754 --> 00:41:45.964
Merci. papa.

971
00:41:51.594 --> 00:41:52.637
I'm sorry.

972
00:41:52.637 --> 00:41:53.263
I could just feel the tension.

973
00:41:53.263 --> 00:41:54.472
So--

974
00:41:54.472 --> 00:41:56.141
No. you were just
trying to help.

975
00:41:56.141 --> 00:41:57.642
I'm going back to
America anyway.

976
00:41:57.642 --> 00:42:01.062
So it really doesn't
matter what they think.

977
00:42:01.062 --> 00:42:03.356
I mean. it sounded like
you guys were getting along.

978
00:42:03.356 --> 00:42:05.775
Based on a lie.

979
00:42:05.775 --> 00:42:07.861
We really need to
get our story straight.

980
00:42:07.861 --> 00:42:09.654
I don't even know
where you live.

981
00:42:09.654 --> 00:42:10.989
Park Slope.

982
00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:11.990
OK.

983
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.408
You're in Chelsea. right?

984
00:42:13.408 --> 00:42:15.827
Yeah.

985
00:42:15.827 --> 00:42:17.662
What's your shirt size?

986
00:42:17.662 --> 00:42:19.831
Medium.

987
00:42:19.831 --> 00:42:21.708
Birthday?

988
00:42:21.708 --> 00:42:24.336
July 8. 1987.

989
00:42:24.336 --> 00:42:26.379
Oh.

990
00:42:26.379 --> 00:42:30.258
Looks like you've landed
yourself a younger man.

991
00:42:30.258 --> 00:42:33.803
September 17. 1987.

992
00:42:33.803 --> 00:42:34.888
How do you say it in America?

993
00:42:34.888 --> 00:42:37.432
It's cougar?

994
00:42:37.432 --> 00:42:38.099
OK.

995
00:42:44.647 --> 00:42:45.398
Do you miss it?

996
00:42:47.984 --> 00:42:50.445
I idolized my
father growing up.

997
00:42:50.445 --> 00:42:54.366
watching him run the
store. always in control.

998
00:42:54.366 --> 00:42:56.826
Is Laurent why you decided
to become a creative director?

999
00:42:56.826 --> 00:42:59.204
Absolutely.

1000
00:42:59.204 --> 00:43:02.874
Everything about this
place inspired me.

1001
00:43:02.874 --> 00:43:05.960
What did your dad mean by 911?

1002
00:43:24.854 --> 00:43:25.897
That was Marianne.

1003
00:43:25.897 --> 00:43:28.316
She wants to see us right away.

1004
00:43:28.316 --> 00:43:29.401
OK.

1005
00:43:29.401 --> 00:43:31.152
Let's go.

1006
00:43:31.152 --> 00:43:34.155
Tropez Diamonds. they plan to
launch their American campaign

1007
00:43:34.155 --> 00:43:35.532
before us.

1008
00:43:35.532 --> 00:43:38.743
They want to--
steal our thunder.

1009
00:43:38.743 --> 00:43:40.412
as you say in America.

1010
00:43:40.412 --> 00:43:43.164
Fortunately. Gabriel has
a friend in their company

1011
00:43:43.164 --> 00:43:45.375
who heard about it at
a party last night.

1012
00:43:45.375 --> 00:43:46.459
Sorry I'm late.

1013
00:43:51.423 --> 00:43:55.218
We want to launch the new
campaign ahead of schedule.

1014
00:43:55.218 --> 00:43:56.136
Oh.

1015
00:43:56.136 --> 00:43:57.554
How ahead of schedule?

1016
00:43:57.554 --> 00:43:59.889
Next weekend at the gala.

1017
00:43:59.889 --> 00:44:01.433
That's in six days.

1018
00:44:01.433 --> 00:44:05.603
Yes I thought we could
invite the American press.

1019
00:44:05.603 --> 00:44:06.980
It was my idea.

1020
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.690
Of course it was.

1021
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:10.400
It won't be the
full campaign rollout.

1022
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.903
We just want to give
America a taste of what's

1023
00:44:13.903 --> 00:44:16.281
to come. mark our territory.

1024
00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:20.952
Then we can decide if we'll
proceed with your agency.

1025
00:44:20.952 --> 00:44:22.495
But if it's too soon--

1026
00:44:22.495 --> 00:44:25.498
Consider it done.

1027
00:44:25.498 --> 00:44:27.375
Great.

1028
00:44:27.375 --> 00:44:28.543
Perfect.

1029
00:44:28.543 --> 00:44:29.836
I should have gone home.

1030
00:44:29.836 --> 00:44:31.463
Relax.

1031
00:44:31.463 --> 00:44:33.965
Some of my best ideas
come to me under pressure.

1032
00:44:33.965 --> 00:44:36.092
It's like the diamond process--

1033
00:44:36.092 --> 00:44:39.262
starts as ugly carbon
beneath the surface.

1034
00:44:39.262 --> 00:44:41.806
then after millions of years.
it turns into the most beautiful

1035
00:44:41.806 --> 00:44:43.141
substance in the world.

1036
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:45.185
Well. sir. we do not
have a million years.

1037
00:44:45.185 --> 00:44:47.270
We have less than six days.

1038
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:49.773
I didn't realize
you got a video. too.

1039
00:44:49.773 --> 00:44:51.483
It's spontaneous.

1040
00:44:51.483 --> 00:44:55.862
Would you look at her light
up at the sight of that ring?

1041
00:44:55.862 --> 00:44:58.656
How did you feel
when your ex proposed?

1042
00:44:58.656 --> 00:45:00.116
My whole world stopped.

1043
00:45:02.535 --> 00:45:10.001
It was real. even if it was
just for a blink of an eye.

1044
00:45:10.001 --> 00:45:12.295
What if we do a campaign
centered around real life

1045
00:45:12.295 --> 00:45:13.838
proposals that we capture?

1046
00:45:13.838 --> 00:45:14.923
Here in Paris?

1047
00:45:14.923 --> 00:45:16.841
Yes. with Americans.

1048
00:45:16.841 --> 00:45:18.510
It would be cost effective.

1049
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:20.053
And special and unique.

1050
00:45:31.439 --> 00:45:33.983
I am going stir crazy
in that room. Lily.

1051
00:45:33.983 --> 00:45:34.984
Why?

1052
00:45:34.984 --> 00:45:35.735
Did something happen?

1053
00:45:35.735 --> 00:45:36.695
Yes!

1054
00:45:36.695 --> 00:45:37.946
He's messy.

1055
00:45:37.946 --> 00:45:39.239
And he doesn't
believe in alarms.

1056
00:45:39.239 --> 00:45:40.782
Oh. and get this.

1057
00:45:40.782 --> 00:45:43.702
He thinks that American
women flaunt their wealth.

1058
00:45:43.702 --> 00:45:46.121
Yeah. well. it is sort of
a shameless new tradition.

1059
00:45:46.121 --> 00:45:47.706
The ring selfie.

1060
00:45:47.706 --> 00:45:51.126
But it sounds like he's
getting under your skin.

1061
00:45:51.126 --> 00:45:53.086
You know
what that means.

1062
00:45:53.086 --> 00:45:55.296
Oh. no. no. do not say it.

1063
00:45:55.296 --> 00:45:57.841
You like him!

1064
00:45:57.841 --> 00:45:58.633
Admit it.

1065
00:45:58.633 --> 00:45:59.426
You like him.

1066
00:45:59.426 --> 00:46:00.427
Ah. hello.

1067
00:46:00.427 --> 00:46:02.137
Waiting for your better half?

1068
00:46:02.137 --> 00:46:03.179
Hey. you know what?

1069
00:46:03.179 --> 00:46:04.472
I'm going to call you later.

1070
00:46:04.472 --> 00:46:04.889
Bye.

1071
00:46:04.889 --> 00:46:05.306
Ciao.

1072
00:46:07.934 --> 00:46:09.936
A little bit of
sightseeing today?

1073
00:46:09.936 --> 00:46:11.688
Yeah. kind of.

1074
00:46:11.688 --> 00:46:14.107
We're looking for real life
proposals for Durand's new ad

1075
00:46:14.107 --> 00:46:15.275
campaign.

1076
00:46:15.275 --> 00:46:17.235
Oh. but you know.
you can't really

1077
00:46:17.235 --> 00:46:21.114
swing a baguette without
someone proposing in Paris. huh?

1078
00:46:21.114 --> 00:46:23.700
Have you been to
Alexandre III bridge yet?

1079
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.285
You know. I have.

1080
00:46:25.285 --> 00:46:27.037
It's actually one of my
favorite spots in the world.

1081
00:46:27.037 --> 00:46:29.289
Oh. it's the same for me.

1082
00:46:31.541 --> 00:46:33.918
Sir. your croissant
with extra butter.

1083
00:46:33.918 --> 00:46:35.545
Merci beaucoup.

1084
00:46:35.545 --> 00:46:38.757
But you know croissant is
already made out of butter.

1085
00:47:01.613 --> 00:47:03.948
If I remember correctly.
this is your idea

1086
00:47:03.948 --> 00:47:05.450
of a perfect date. no?

1087
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.077
Yeah.

1088
00:47:07.077 --> 00:47:08.411
I don't know.

1089
00:47:08.411 --> 00:47:09.746
Being here reminds
me of being in one

1090
00:47:09.746 --> 00:47:12.207
of those old black
and white French films

1091
00:47:12.207 --> 00:47:14.584
with Simone Signoret
and Yves Montand.

1092
00:47:14.584 --> 00:47:18.546
They were like the power
couple of French cinema.

1093
00:47:18.546 --> 00:47:21.758
That was Simon's
second marriage.

1094
00:47:21.758 --> 00:47:24.427
Montand was her true love.

1095
00:47:24.427 --> 00:47:28.139
No. I did not know that.

1096
00:47:28.139 --> 00:47:32.811
So my mother wants us
over for dinner tonight.

1097
00:47:35.438 --> 00:47:37.899
Sebastian I don't know
if I can keep doing this.

1098
00:47:37.899 --> 00:47:39.484
What's one more dinner?

1099
00:47:39.484 --> 00:47:42.737
You'll never have to see
them again after the gala.

1100
00:47:42.737 --> 00:47:44.864
Please?

1101
00:47:44.864 --> 00:47:45.532
Fine.

1102
00:47:54.124 --> 00:47:55.959
OK. super.

1103
00:47:55.959 --> 00:47:57.168
Go. all right?

1104
00:47:57.168 --> 00:47:58.628
Up a piece

1105
00:47:58.628 --> 00:47:59.254
Don't drop me.

1106
00:47:59.254 --> 00:47:59.963
I won't drop you.

1107
00:47:59.963 --> 00:48:00.672
Don't worry.

1108
00:48:06.302 --> 00:48:07.971
See. I didn't drop you.

1109
00:48:07.971 --> 00:48:09.180
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1110
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.098
Are you guys American?

1111
00:48:10.098 --> 00:48:11.016
Uh. yeah.

1112
00:48:11.016 --> 00:48:12.267
Ohio born and raised.

1113
00:48:12.267 --> 00:48:13.560
I'm from Cincinnati.

1114
00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.811
Columbus.

1115
00:48:14.811 --> 00:48:15.770
Go Buckeyes.

1116
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:17.313
Yeah.

1117
00:48:17.313 --> 00:48:19.816
We are doing an ad
campaign for Durand Diamonds.

1118
00:48:19.816 --> 00:48:21.317
Oh. mine's Durand.

1119
00:48:21.317 --> 00:48:22.902
Yeah. I bought
it here. and then I

1120
00:48:22.902 --> 00:48:24.320
proposed at the Eiffel Tower.

1121
00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.655
You guys. congratulations.

1122
00:48:25.655 --> 00:48:27.657
We want to feature
real couples.

1123
00:48:27.657 --> 00:48:30.577
Would you mind if we ask you
a few questions on camera?

1124
00:48:30.577 --> 00:48:31.161
Of course.

1125
00:48:31.161 --> 00:48:31.786
Sure.

1126
00:48:31.786 --> 00:48:32.579
Merci.

1127
00:48:32.579 --> 00:48:33.163
Thank you.

1128
00:48:33.163 --> 00:48:33.872
It'll be quick.

1129
00:48:36.374 --> 00:48:39.544
OK. so you guys are from Ohio.

1130
00:48:39.544 --> 00:48:42.213
{\an8}What brought you to
Paris for your proposal?

1131
00:48:42.213 --> 00:48:44.382
{\an8}He knows I've
dreamed of coming here

1132
00:48:44.382 --> 00:48:46.384
{\an8}since I was a little girl.

1133
00:48:46.384 --> 00:48:49.179
{\an8}Paris is the most
romantic place on Earth.

1134
00:48:49.179 --> 00:48:50.930
{\an8}I want her to always
remember that this

1135
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:55.310
{\an8}is where our commitment to
each other officially began.

1136
00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:56.186
{\an8}That's perfect.

1137
00:48:56.186 --> 00:48:57.562
{\an8}Thank you guys so much.

1138
00:48:57.562 --> 00:48:58.146
{\an8}Merci.

1139
00:48:58.146 --> 00:48:59.022
{\an8}Congrats.

1140
00:48:59.022 --> 00:49:00.273
Thank you.

1141
00:49:00.273 --> 00:49:01.191
Aw.

1142
00:49:01.191 --> 00:49:02.942
Well. it's nice.

1143
00:49:02.942 --> 00:49:04.235
Yeah.

1144
00:49:04.235 --> 00:49:06.821
You know. you're
really good with people.

1145
00:49:06.821 --> 00:49:09.115
Oh. it's easy when you're
in the middle of a real life

1146
00:49:09.115 --> 00:49:10.742
romance novel.

1147
00:49:10.742 --> 00:49:14.204
Hey. isn't this where your
grandparents got engaged?

1148
00:49:14.204 --> 00:49:15.330
I remember in the photo.

1149
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:17.207
Yeah.

1150
00:49:17.207 --> 00:49:20.627
They had much better
sense than I did.

1151
00:49:20.627 --> 00:49:27.008
You know. for what it's worth.
I think your ex was a fool.

1152
00:49:27.008 --> 00:49:30.679
Thank you. Sebastian.

1153
00:49:30.679 --> 00:49:32.722
Do you guys want me to
take a picture of you?

1154
00:49:32.722 --> 00:49:33.264
Oh. no. it's OK.

1155
00:49:33.264 --> 00:49:34.224
Why not?

1156
00:49:34.224 --> 00:49:35.100
Will you use my phone?

1157
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:35.725
Yeah.

1158
00:49:35.725 --> 00:49:35.934
Come.

1159
00:49:39.312 --> 00:49:40.063
Merci.

1160
00:49:40.063 --> 00:49:41.064
Thank you.

1161
00:49:41.064 --> 00:49:45.193
Sebastian!

1162
00:49:45.193 --> 00:49:46.069
I think it's good.

1163
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:47.070
OK.

1164
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:48.738
Now can she dip me?

1165
00:49:48.738 --> 00:49:49.656
No. we're good.

1166
00:49:49.656 --> 00:49:50.323
No?

1167
00:49:50.323 --> 00:49:51.533
Thank you so much.

1168
00:49:51.533 --> 00:49:52.909
We're going to your
parents' house.

1169
00:49:52.909 --> 00:49:53.702
Bye.

1170
00:49:53.702 --> 00:49:56.454
Here we go.

1171
00:49:56.454 --> 00:50:00.083
So. tell us. how is
the campaign going?

1172
00:50:00.083 --> 00:50:03.461
Well. it's been interesting.

1173
00:50:03.461 --> 00:50:07.090
Well. I just hope that
you are keeping it simple.

1174
00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.592
The Durands are
very traditional.

1175
00:50:09.592 --> 00:50:11.094
Oui. Papa. I just said.

1176
00:50:11.094 --> 00:50:15.265
Did he tell you about
what happened at the store

1177
00:50:15.265 --> 00:50:16.266
with the fire?

1178
00:50:16.266 --> 00:50:17.100
Please. Jacques.

1179
00:50:18.268 --> 00:50:22.564
No. we can love about it now.

1180
00:50:22.564 --> 00:50:28.528
Sebastian decided to recreate
by carnival at Laurent

1181
00:50:28.528 --> 00:50:32.323
complete with flamethrowers.

1182
00:50:32.323 --> 00:50:34.534
The Coat Department
caught on fire.

1183
00:50:34.534 --> 00:50:36.036
and the sprinklers went off.

1184
00:50:36.036 --> 00:50:39.164
The insurance company
were not pleased.

1185
00:50:39.164 --> 00:50:40.999
Millions of dollars in damage.

1186
00:50:40.999 --> 00:50:42.709
And they'll never
hear the end of it.

1187
00:50:42.709 --> 00:50:46.296
Our clients don't
need the fanfare.

1188
00:50:46.296 --> 00:50:48.548
Sebastian's our
top creative director

1189
00:50:48.548 --> 00:50:50.675
because of those big ideas.

1190
00:50:50.675 --> 00:50:54.637
And sometimes those big
ideas lead to big headaches.

1191
00:50:54.637 --> 00:50:58.141
Or sometimes they can
take your breath away.

1192
00:50:58.141 --> 00:50:58.767
Touché.

1193
00:51:03.188 --> 00:51:04.647
Thank you for that tonight.

1194
00:51:04.647 --> 00:51:08.234
I love my father very
much. but our relationship

1195
00:51:08.234 --> 00:51:10.737
is complicated.

1196
00:51:10.737 --> 00:51:12.989
Oh. shooting for
the stars is great.

1197
00:51:12.989 --> 00:51:17.827
but sometimes it's OK to turn
down the heat a little. too.

1198
00:51:17.827 --> 00:51:19.913
Is that a reference
to my flamethrowers?

1199
00:51:19.913 --> 00:51:20.330
Yes.

1200
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:22.332
He's right.

1201
00:51:22.332 --> 00:51:23.541
You're right.

1202
00:51:23.541 --> 00:51:25.794
I do go too far sometimes.

1203
00:51:25.794 --> 00:51:27.337
No.

1204
00:51:27.337 --> 00:51:32.884
No. thinking big. that's
what makes you. you.

1205
00:51:32.884 --> 00:51:35.887
But I do feel like you
should speak with your dad.

1206
00:51:35.887 --> 00:51:40.892
I really feel like tonight lit
a fire on your relationship.

1207
00:51:40.892 --> 00:51:42.310
I'm sorry.

1208
00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:44.312
I'll stop.

1209
00:51:44.312 --> 00:51:44.938
Thank you.

1210
00:51:49.567 --> 00:51:50.819
You're up early.

1211
00:51:50.819 --> 00:51:51.736
Hey.

1212
00:51:51.736 --> 00:51:53.029
Yeah. I just-- I couldn't sleep.

1213
00:51:53.029 --> 00:51:55.031
I just kept thinking
about the campaign.

1214
00:51:55.031 --> 00:51:57.075
When I used to help out
with them on the pop shops

1215
00:51:57.075 --> 00:51:58.952
back in Ohio. the most
important thing to them

1216
00:51:58.952 --> 00:52:00.954
was that their customers
knew they were selling

1217
00:52:00.954 --> 00:52:02.872
more than just a
product. like something

1218
00:52:02.872 --> 00:52:05.500
they believed in. that they
put their whole lives into.

1219
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.002
What are you saying?

1220
00:52:07.002 --> 00:52:08.420
Well. I mean. right
now. it just kind of feels

1221
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.879
like we're selling
a travel campaign.

1222
00:52:09.879 --> 00:52:12.382
Why you should get
proposed to in Paris.

1223
00:52:12.382 --> 00:52:14.968
not why you should
buy a Durand Diamond.

1224
00:52:14.968 --> 00:52:17.971
I want to know the history of
Durand. the lore of Durand.

1225
00:52:17.971 --> 00:52:19.556
the quality.

1226
00:52:19.556 --> 00:52:21.433
What makes them special?

1227
00:52:21.433 --> 00:52:23.977
I have an idea.

1228
00:52:23.977 --> 00:52:27.230
May we hear about
the Rosé diamond?

1229
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:28.481
The Rosé diamond.

1230
00:52:28.481 --> 00:52:29.774
Of course.

1231
00:52:29.774 --> 00:52:33.528
The most rare piece
in our collection.

1232
00:52:33.528 --> 00:52:36.698
The stone was brought
to us from India.

1233
00:52:36.698 --> 00:52:42.245
Only .0001% of the world's
diamonds are this color.

1234
00:52:42.245 --> 00:52:44.873
It almost looks like
there's a rose in the center.

1235
00:52:44.873 --> 00:52:50.253
Would
you like to try it on?

1236
00:52:50.253 --> 00:52:51.212
Oh.

1237
00:52:51.212 --> 00:52:52.547
No. I couldn't.

1238
00:52:52.547 --> 00:52:54.466
But you must.

1239
00:52:54.466 --> 00:52:55.133
Really?

1240
00:53:01.306 --> 00:53:03.933
Wow.

1241
00:53:03.933 --> 00:53:05.435
Voila.

1242
00:53:05.435 --> 00:53:08.313
It matches your beauty. Anna.

1243
00:53:08.313 --> 00:53:09.606
It's amazing.

1244
00:53:09.606 --> 00:53:12.150
This ring never
leaves the store. right?

1245
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:13.360
Uh. no.

1246
00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.944
It's under heavy guard.

1247
00:53:14.944 --> 00:53:17.822
We have bulletproof glass
and a laser alarm system.

1248
00:53:17.822 --> 00:53:19.574
Would it be totally
out of the question

1249
00:53:19.574 --> 00:53:21.451
to suggest displaying it?

1250
00:53:21.451 --> 00:53:22.410
Yes.

1251
00:53:22.410 --> 00:53:23.912
Yes. for the gala.

1252
00:53:23.912 --> 00:53:26.331
We can introduce it to
America. generate some buzz.

1253
00:53:26.331 --> 00:53:28.166
Even better. you
could wear it. Anna.

1254
00:53:28.166 --> 00:53:30.877
But I don't even have a
dress to the gala. let alone

1255
00:53:30.877 --> 00:53:33.004
something to match this iceberg.

1256
00:53:33.004 --> 00:53:34.714
Ah.

1257
00:53:34.714 --> 00:53:39.636
Fortunately. Sebastian knows
every designer in the city.

1258
00:53:57.362 --> 00:53:58.947
Is Sebastian on his way?

1259
00:53:58.947 --> 00:54:00.990
Yes. he just texted me.

1260
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:03.410
Something to drink. madame?

1261
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.161
Yes. a coffee. merci.

1262
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:06.579
And for Sebastian?

1263
00:54:06.579 --> 00:54:07.580
Oh. he'll be fine.

1264
00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.456
Thank you.

1265
00:54:08.456 --> 00:54:09.457
But it's no trouble.

1266
00:54:09.457 --> 00:54:10.417
What does he drink?

1267
00:54:10.417 --> 00:54:13.086
We have everything here.

1268
00:54:13.086 --> 00:54:16.965
Chai latte. three
pumps. skim milk.

1269
00:54:16.965 --> 00:54:22.429
Oh. and light on water.
no foam. 120 degrees.

1270
00:54:22.429 --> 00:54:23.388
Bonjour.

1271
00:54:23.388 --> 00:54:25.974
So let's see this video.

1272
00:54:37.318 --> 00:54:40.113
Paris is the
most romantic place on Earth.

1273
00:54:40.113 --> 00:54:41.990
I want
her to always remember

1274
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:43.867
that this is where our
commitment to each other

1275
00:54:43.867 --> 00:54:44.868
officially began.

1276
00:54:47.287 --> 00:54:49.831
So now you have it--

1277
00:54:49.831 --> 00:54:52.709
real couples. real proposals.

1278
00:54:52.709 --> 00:54:54.669
{\an8}I like it. but--

1279
00:54:54.669 --> 00:55:00.008
it's missing something.

1280
00:55:00.008 --> 00:55:00.925
OK.

1281
00:55:00.925 --> 00:55:03.845
It's like a home video.

1282
00:55:03.845 --> 00:55:05.930
It's provincial.

1283
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.390
Not pedestrian?

1284
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:09.601
Yes. that. too.

1285
00:55:09.601 --> 00:55:15.607
I mean. it smells like cheap
perfume hanging in the air.

1286
00:55:15.607 --> 00:55:18.985
Marianne. we have
the models ready.

1287
00:55:18.985 --> 00:55:21.946
We have the fireworks
ready to go for the gala.

1288
00:55:21.946 --> 00:55:25.533
But I like that
this is different.

1289
00:55:25.533 --> 00:55:28.286
It captures Paris
and our style.

1290
00:55:28.286 --> 00:55:35.377
but it's lacking
something intimate.

1291
00:55:35.377 --> 00:55:37.003
Right.

1292
00:55:37.003 --> 00:55:39.297
You have two days. OK?

1293
00:55:39.297 --> 00:55:42.717
Otherwise. we have to
go with Gabriel's plan.

1294
00:55:42.717 --> 00:55:44.386
OK.

1295
00:55:49.891 --> 00:55:51.393
What are we going to do?

1296
00:55:51.393 --> 00:55:52.936
I don't know.

1297
00:55:52.936 --> 00:55:57.565
But I can just see my father's
face. another failure.

1298
00:55:57.565 --> 00:55:59.234
Oh. you didn't fail.

1299
00:55:59.234 --> 00:56:01.820
You put yourself out there.
trying to do something unique.

1300
00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:04.906
That's very sweet
of you to say.

1301
00:56:04.906 --> 00:56:08.868
I hope you don't
mind. but I've planned

1302
00:56:08.868 --> 00:56:10.120
a little surprise for you.

1303
00:56:17.919 --> 00:56:20.130
Sebastian. what's happening?

1304
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.090
Well. you need a dress. right?

1305
00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:23.299
Bonsoir.

1306
00:56:23.299 --> 00:56:23.967
Bonsoir. Julianne.

1307
00:56:24.884 --> 00:56:25.677
Welcome to Laurent.

1308
00:56:25.677 --> 00:56:28.263
Merci.

1309
00:56:28.263 --> 00:56:30.598
For the next two
hours. consider us

1310
00:56:30.598 --> 00:56:33.351
all your personal shopper.

1311
00:56:33.351 --> 00:56:36.021
Whatever you
need for the gala.

1312
00:56:36.021 --> 00:56:37.605
Thank you so much.

1313
00:56:37.605 --> 00:56:38.773
Thank Sebastian.

1314
00:56:38.773 --> 00:56:41.151
Ah. it was all
my mother. really.

1315
00:56:41.151 --> 00:56:42.986
No more window shopping for you.

1316
00:57:15.852 --> 00:57:17.312
Did you get
everything you need?

1317
00:57:17.312 --> 00:57:18.063
I did.

1318
00:57:18.063 --> 00:57:19.981
Thank you very much.

1319
00:57:19.981 --> 00:57:24.152
I got a little
something else for you.

1320
00:57:24.152 --> 00:57:27.322
I'm sorry it's
only costume. but.

1321
00:57:27.322 --> 00:57:28.990
It's beautiful.

1322
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.783
Can I try it on?

1323
00:57:29.783 --> 00:57:31.368
Of course.

1324
00:57:31.368 --> 00:57:32.369
Will you help me?

1325
00:57:32.369 --> 00:57:33.203
Of course.

1326
00:57:33.203 --> 00:57:34.662
Here. I'll let you take it.

1327
00:57:34.662 --> 00:57:35.288
Merci.

1328
00:58:01.481 --> 00:58:02.190
Here we go.

1329
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:03.316
Here is your tuxedo.

1330
00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:07.570
Thank you.

1331
00:58:10.573 --> 00:58:12.867
Ah. merci.

1332
00:58:12.867 --> 00:58:14.953
Merci.

1333
00:58:14.953 --> 00:58:15.995
Thank you so much.

1334
00:58:15.995 --> 00:58:16.871
Good night.

1335
00:58:16.871 --> 00:58:19.374
Merci.

1336
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:36.433
Oh.

1337
00:58:36.433 --> 00:58:36.850
Hey.

1338
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:37.642
Hi.

1339
00:58:37.642 --> 00:58:39.602
Good morning.

1340
00:58:39.602 --> 00:58:40.562
Oh. perfect.

1341
00:58:40.562 --> 00:58:42.022
Thank you.

1342
00:58:42.022 --> 00:58:43.606
I was actually on my
way to get coffee. so.

1343
00:58:49.279 --> 00:58:50.030
You go.

1344
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:51.573
About last night. I--

1345
00:58:51.573 --> 00:58:53.700
It was nice.

1346
00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:57.412
I mean. don't you think we
maybe got a little caught up?

1347
00:58:57.412 --> 00:58:59.122
Is that so bad?

1348
00:58:59.122 --> 00:59:00.331
Because we work together.

1349
00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:03.752
Yeah. you have
to start somewhere.

1350
00:59:03.752 --> 00:59:04.836
Look at Marianne and Louis.

1351
00:59:07.756 --> 00:59:12.260
Yeah. you know. I actually
think you're on to something.

1352
00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:13.928
Really?

1353
00:59:13.928 --> 00:59:14.846
Yeah.

1354
00:59:14.846 --> 00:59:15.805
Well. for the campaign.

1355
00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:20.894
Yeah.

1356
00:59:20.894 --> 00:59:23.480
Your love is what
everybody wants.

1357
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.524
And that love is
woven into every piece

1358
00:59:26.524 --> 00:59:28.234
of jewelry you sell.

1359
00:59:28.234 --> 00:59:31.321
We want to make your love story
the center of the campaign.

1360
00:59:31.321 --> 00:59:33.073
And if you like
this campaign. we

1361
00:59:33.073 --> 00:59:35.700
can post it online
right after the gala.

1362
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.119
We love it.

1363
00:59:38.119 --> 00:59:39.954
But can you get
it finished in time?

1364
00:59:39.954 --> 00:59:41.790
You have less than two days.

1365
01:00:05.146 --> 01:00:07.190
Are you decent?

1366
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:11.403
If you mean James
Bond decent. then yes.

1367
01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:16.908
I don't know what that
means. but oh. you look nice.

1368
01:00:16.908 --> 01:00:21.204
You look like a
million dollars.

1369
01:00:21.204 --> 01:00:25.208
Well. I'm about to
be $23 million. so.

1370
01:00:29.587 --> 01:00:30.505
Marianne.

1371
01:00:30.505 --> 01:00:31.339
Bonsoir. Sebastian.

1372
01:00:31.339 --> 01:00:32.007
Bonsoir.

1373
01:00:32.007 --> 01:00:33.633
Muah. muah.

1374
01:00:33.633 --> 01:00:36.928
Oh. Anna. you
look so stunning.

1375
01:00:36.928 --> 01:00:38.138
Thank you.

1376
01:00:38.138 --> 01:00:39.597
Oh. wow.

1377
01:00:39.597 --> 01:00:41.182
Why do I feel like we're
about to be arrested?

1378
01:00:41.182 --> 01:00:43.351
Don't make jokes
around the bodyguards.

1379
01:00:43.351 --> 01:00:44.728
No sense of humor.

1380
01:00:51.943 --> 01:00:52.569
Voila.

1381
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.449
Wow.

1382
01:00:57.449 --> 01:00:59.367
I have one more
thing for you. too--

1383
01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:00.577
a thank you gift.

1384
01:01:05.832 --> 01:01:06.458
Wedding bands.

1385
01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:08.335
Um. no. we can't.

1386
01:01:08.335 --> 01:01:09.002
We can't.

1387
01:01:09.002 --> 01:01:10.253
Marianne--

1388
01:01:10.253 --> 01:01:11.463
They are engraved
with your name.

1389
01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:12.964
I had to guess the size.

1390
01:01:12.964 --> 01:01:14.716
I hope they fit.

1391
01:01:14.716 --> 01:01:16.009
Let's see them on.

1392
01:01:16.009 --> 01:01:16.634
Merci.

1393
01:01:23.516 --> 01:01:28.229
Now. you are officially
a married couple.

1394
01:01:28.229 --> 01:01:33.026
Love is beautiful. and
you two are glowing.

1395
01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:34.444
Thank you.

1396
01:01:34.444 --> 01:01:37.364
OK. now. let's go
and introduce America

1397
01:01:37.364 --> 01:01:38.365
to this diamond.

1398
01:01:38.365 --> 01:01:39.866
You know what?

1399
01:01:39.866 --> 01:01:41.201
I just need another minute
to finish getting ready.

1400
01:01:41.201 --> 01:01:42.744
so I will meet you downstairs.

1401
01:01:42.744 --> 01:01:43.370
Of course.

1402
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:44.371
Thank you.

1403
01:01:44.371 --> 01:01:46.748
You two. stay by the door.

1404
01:01:46.748 --> 01:01:49.709
I'll see you out.

1405
01:01:49.709 --> 01:01:50.960
Merci. Marianne.

1406
01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.046
Merci beaucoup.

1407
01:01:53.046 --> 01:01:53.963
Sebastian--

1408
01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:56.049
I know. I know.

1409
01:01:56.049 --> 01:02:01.680
But we agreed we would tell
them the truth when this is all

1410
01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.597
over.

1411
01:02:02.597 --> 01:02:04.849
We can't ruin this for them.

1412
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:06.059
OK?

1413
01:02:06.059 --> 01:02:07.143
OK.

1414
01:02:07.143 --> 01:02:10.897
So after the presentation.

1415
01:02:10.897 --> 01:02:13.274
Deal.

1416
01:02:13.274 --> 01:02:14.818
I'm going to finish
getting ready.

1417
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:24.494
Let's feature the
encrusted collar.

1418
01:02:24.494 --> 01:02:26.996
Yes. nice big smile.

1419
01:02:26.996 --> 01:02:28.248
Oh. wow.

1420
01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:29.374
That is big.

1421
01:02:29.374 --> 01:02:31.751
I can't believe it's real.

1422
01:02:31.751 --> 01:02:33.253
How does it feel
to be wearing it?

1423
01:02:33.253 --> 01:02:35.922
Incredibly fake. Lily.

1424
01:02:35.922 --> 01:02:38.299
No. you deserve this.
based on your ideas

1425
01:02:38.299 --> 01:02:41.261
and your hard
work. nothing else.

1426
01:02:41.261 --> 01:02:41.928
Love you. buds.

1427
01:02:41.928 --> 01:02:43.263
Love you.

1428
01:02:43.263 --> 01:02:45.265
And have fun.

1429
01:02:45.265 --> 01:02:47.225
Are you ready?

1430
01:02:47.225 --> 01:02:48.351
I'm ready.

1431
01:02:48.351 --> 01:02:49.227
Let's go.

1432
01:02:49.227 --> 01:02:49.853
OK.

1433
01:02:57.652 --> 01:03:01.740
Oh. my parents. 12
o'clock. and my brother.

1434
01:03:06.327 --> 01:03:06.870
Hello.

1435
01:03:09.664 --> 01:03:11.332
You look wonderful. Anna.

1436
01:03:11.332 --> 01:03:14.002
Thank you so much for
this beautiful dress.

1437
01:03:14.002 --> 01:03:14.961
It's amazing.

1438
01:03:14.961 --> 01:03:17.797
It's my pleasure.

1439
01:03:17.797 --> 01:03:18.173
Bonjour. Anna.

1440
01:03:18.173 --> 01:03:19.632
Marcel.

1441
01:03:19.632 --> 01:03:20.300
Bonsoir.

1442
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:20.967
Nice to meet you.

1443
01:03:20.967 --> 01:03:21.634
Wonderful.

1444
01:03:21.634 --> 01:03:22.135
Marcel.

1445
01:03:22.135 --> 01:03:23.970
Sebastian.

1446
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:25.305
It's good to see you.

1447
01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:28.016
I'm excited to see what
you've come up with.

1448
01:03:28.016 --> 01:03:29.434
Congratulations.

1449
01:03:30.477 --> 01:03:32.812
Yes. of course.

1450
01:03:32.812 --> 01:03:33.229
Oh. sorry.

1451
01:03:36.649 --> 01:03:39.444
Nice to see the
Rosé on display.

1452
01:03:39.444 --> 01:03:41.154
It's funny.

1453
01:03:41.154 --> 01:03:42.322
I kind of feel like I'm going to
turn into a pumpkin at midnight

1454
01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:43.031
wearing it.

1455
01:03:43.031 --> 01:03:43.656
Anna.

1456
01:03:46.409 --> 01:03:47.577
Surprise.

1457
01:03:47.577 --> 01:03:48.995
Bonjour. Anna.

1458
01:03:48.995 --> 01:03:51.081
Caroline!

1459
01:03:51.081 --> 01:03:53.166
You're here in Paris.

1460
01:03:53.166 --> 01:03:54.209
Oui.

1461
01:03:54.209 --> 01:03:55.669
I just couldn't help myself.

1462
01:03:55.669 --> 01:03:57.671
You two sounded like you
were having so much fun.

1463
01:03:57.671 --> 01:03:59.464
and there's just so
much on the line.

1464
01:03:59.464 --> 01:04:01.716
I thought I should come
and cheer on my best team.

1465
01:04:01.716 --> 01:04:04.177
Plus. who can resist Paris?

1466
01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:05.345
I mean. it's Paris.

1467
01:04:05.345 --> 01:04:06.137
It's great.

1468
01:04:06.137 --> 01:04:07.722
It's perfect.

1469
01:04:07.722 --> 01:04:13.395
I am Gabriel Blanchett from
the agency here in Paris.

1470
01:04:13.395 --> 01:04:14.562
Enchanté.

1471
01:04:14.562 --> 01:04:15.689
Nice to meet
you. too. Gabriel.

1472
01:04:15.689 --> 01:04:18.358
I'm Caroline. the boss.

1473
01:04:18.358 --> 01:04:19.567
Boss.

1474
01:04:19.567 --> 01:04:22.028
Perhaps I can
offer you a drink?

1475
01:04:22.028 --> 01:04:23.530
I'd love that.

1476
01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:25.365
I can't wait to be dazzled
by the presentation.

1477
01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:26.074
Oh. yes.

1478
01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:28.952
Absolutely.

1479
01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.078
This is really bad.

1480
01:04:30.078 --> 01:04:31.121
Relax.

1481
01:04:31.121 --> 01:04:32.372
We have a plan.

1482
01:04:32.372 --> 01:04:34.124
Everything's going to be OK.

1483
01:04:34.124 --> 01:04:35.208
Is it?

1484
01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:36.251
I promise.

1485
01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:38.795
Ladies and gentlemen. please.

1486
01:04:38.795 --> 01:04:39.254
Thank you.

1487
01:04:42.257 --> 01:04:43.717
Bonsoir. everyone.

1488
01:04:43.717 --> 01:04:47.137
We hope you're having
a wonderful evening.

1489
01:04:47.137 --> 01:04:49.764
Thank you for coming to the
20th annual Durand Diamonds

1490
01:04:49.764 --> 01:04:50.348
gala.

1491
01:04:51.057 --> 01:04:52.392
Thank you.

1492
01:04:52.392 --> 01:04:53.101
Bravo!

1493
01:04:55.729 --> 01:05:00.191
Tonight. we want to celebrate
a very special announcement.

1494
01:05:00.191 --> 01:05:04.195
But before we do that. we'd
like to call up our ad team.

1495
01:05:04.195 --> 01:05:08.408
Please welcome Anna Bowman
and Sebastian Laurent.

1496
01:05:08.408 --> 01:05:09.367
Woo!

1497
01:05:12.746 --> 01:05:15.790
They're here from New York to
help us launch a new endeavor.

1498
01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:19.294
And Anna is wearing
the Rosé diamond.

1499
01:05:19.294 --> 01:05:22.422
which is so special
to our family.

1500
01:05:22.422 --> 01:05:25.675
Doesn't it look
beautiful on her?

1501
01:05:25.675 --> 01:05:30.013
So without further ado.
after more than 100 years.

1502
01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:33.933
as the premiere diamond
destination in Europe.

1503
01:05:33.933 --> 01:05:39.105
Durand Diamond is
expanding into America.

1504
01:05:43.234 --> 01:05:46.821
And now we'll turn the mic
over to Anna and Sebastian

1505
01:05:46.821 --> 01:05:50.200
for a special presentation.

1506
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.117
Voila.

1507
01:05:51.117 --> 01:05:51.951
Merci.

1508
01:05:51.951 --> 01:05:52.577
Merci. Marianne.

1509
01:05:52.577 --> 01:05:53.286
Merci. Louis.

1510
01:05:54.662 --> 01:05:56.623
Well. as they say
in America. there's

1511
01:05:56.623 --> 01:05:59.626
no better place to pop
the question than Paris.

1512
01:05:59.626 --> 01:06:02.629
And no better way to
do it than with Durand.

1513
01:06:02.629 --> 01:06:06.549
The brand is known for
their history. romance.

1514
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:10.303
Their style. but not
everyone can come to Paris

1515
01:06:10.303 --> 01:06:11.763
for the perfect proposal.

1516
01:06:11.763 --> 01:06:14.140
But now everyone can
have a piece of Paris

1517
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:17.977
with Durand opening across
major cities in America.

1518
01:06:17.977 --> 01:06:20.105
We have prepared something
for you to watch.

1519
01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:21.815
So if you could. please.

1520
01:06:21.815 --> 01:06:22.315
Merci.

1521
01:06:42.043 --> 01:06:45.088
I remember proposing
like it was yesterday.

1522
01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:50.385
He took me to the famous
clock behind the Musee d'Orsay.

1523
01:06:50.385 --> 01:06:51.886
It was only natural
since she kept

1524
01:06:51.886 --> 01:06:54.514
saying the clock was ticking.

1525
01:06:54.514 --> 01:06:57.517
I was taking too long to ask.

1526
01:06:57.517 --> 01:07:03.064
I got down on one knee. and
I proposed with a Durand ring

1527
01:07:03.064 --> 01:07:04.524
I designed myself.

1528
01:07:04.524 --> 01:07:07.277
Of course. the
ring was perfect.

1529
01:07:07.277 --> 01:07:11.656
but in fact. it was the look
in his eye which captured me.

1530
01:07:11.656 --> 01:07:15.201
He was usually so
sure of himself.

1531
01:07:15.201 --> 01:07:20.373
And yet. he was so
unsure in this moment.

1532
01:07:20.373 --> 01:07:22.042
Of course I was worried.

1533
01:07:22.042 --> 01:07:25.420
Would she really agree to
share her life with me?

1534
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.672
Would you see into my heart?

1535
01:07:27.672 --> 01:07:29.382
I did.

1536
01:07:29.382 --> 01:07:35.513
I do. just as you have always
been able to see into my soul.

1537
01:07:35.513 --> 01:07:38.933
That is what
we put in every piece we make.

1538
01:07:38.933 --> 01:07:46.816
Durand Diamond is about
love. commitment. family.

1539
01:07:46.816 --> 01:07:50.403
We help people to
make timeless memory.

1540
01:07:50.403 --> 01:07:53.156
Heirlooms of our
lives together.

1541
01:08:06.419 --> 01:08:08.129
Congratulations.

1542
01:08:08.129 --> 01:08:10.882
You really captured
the message for Durand.

1543
01:08:10.882 --> 01:08:13.802
Well. it was all Anna's idea.

1544
01:08:13.802 --> 01:08:15.595
No. it was teamwork.

1545
01:08:15.595 --> 01:08:18.598
My instincts are always right.

1546
01:08:18.598 --> 01:08:20.225
So are mine.

1547
01:08:20.225 --> 01:08:22.394
So we're happy?

1548
01:08:22.394 --> 01:08:24.229
I'll draw up the contract.

1549
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:27.941
I love these two and
everything they represent.

1550
01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:30.276
What exactly is
that. Marianne?

1551
01:08:30.276 --> 01:08:35.573
Gabriel. sour grapes
never looked good on anyone.

1552
01:08:35.573 --> 01:08:36.950
Of course.

1553
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:38.743
We need champagne
to celebrate.

1554
01:08:38.743 --> 01:08:41.371
Gabriel. come help me.

1555
01:08:41.371 --> 01:08:43.748
Marianne. I really have to
talk to you about something.

1556
01:08:43.748 --> 01:08:44.624
What is it?

1557
01:08:44.624 --> 01:08:45.250
You look so serious.

1558
01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:46.334
It's--

1559
01:08:46.334 --> 01:08:47.627
Marianne. [speaking french].

1560
01:08:47.627 --> 01:08:48.378
Ah. oui.

1561
01:08:48.378 --> 01:08:48.962
We'll be back.

1562
01:08:48.962 --> 01:08:49.713
No. no--

1563
01:08:49.713 --> 01:08:50.463
Just five minutes.

1564
01:08:54.342 --> 01:08:59.305
So it's quite a big
night for your agency. huh?

1565
01:08:59.305 --> 01:09:01.725
Honestly. I did not think
that Sebastian and Anna

1566
01:09:01.725 --> 01:09:03.435
could pull it off.

1567
01:09:03.435 --> 01:09:04.978
I have to admit. there were
times I doubted my decision

1568
01:09:04.978 --> 01:09:07.147
to put them together.

1569
01:09:07.147 --> 01:09:08.940
Really?

1570
01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.359
I know. I know. but
for better or for worse.

1571
01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:12.986
it'll soon be over.

1572
01:09:12.986 --> 01:09:17.407
And they love the campaign
so much. they'll understand.

1573
01:09:17.407 --> 01:09:19.075
OK.

1574
01:09:19.075 --> 01:09:20.785
You should have seen them
before they came to Paris.

1575
01:09:20.785 --> 01:09:22.537
They were at each
other's throats.

1576
01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:23.788
Really?

1577
01:09:23.788 --> 01:09:25.790
They don't like each other?

1578
01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:27.125
I have never
seen two coworkers

1579
01:09:27.125 --> 01:09:30.545
with such opposite styles.

1580
01:09:30.545 --> 01:09:33.631
Co-workers only?

1581
01:09:48.396 --> 01:09:54.778
Ladies and gentlemen. if I
may please have your attention.

1582
01:09:54.778 --> 01:09:56.988
There is one more
thing I would like

1583
01:09:56.988 --> 01:10:00.408
to add this evening
if that's OK with you.

1584
01:10:00.408 --> 01:10:05.205
Since this evening we are
here to celebrate love.

1585
01:10:05.205 --> 01:10:09.042
I would like us to all
please raise your glass

1586
01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:14.381
and make a toast for a
very special occasion.

1587
01:10:14.381 --> 01:10:19.052
We are here to celebrate also
the first year anniversary

1588
01:10:19.052 --> 01:10:22.972
of Sebastian and Anna.

1589
01:10:27.602 --> 01:10:31.648
Sebastian. Anna. please
come to the stage.

1590
01:10:31.648 --> 01:10:32.899
No. no. no.

1591
01:10:32.899 --> 01:10:33.733
Please come to
the stage. please.

1592
01:10:33.733 --> 01:10:34.651
We're OK.

1593
01:10:34.651 --> 01:10:36.569
Please. don't be shy.

1594
01:10:36.569 --> 01:10:38.405
Come on.

1595
01:10:38.405 --> 01:10:39.948
Thank you.

1596
01:10:39.948 --> 01:10:49.499
So let us please toast to a
life full of love. true love.

1597
01:10:49.499 --> 01:10:51.710
Chin. chin.

1598
01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:52.460
To true love.

1599
01:10:54.713 --> 01:10:59.592
It's incredible that two people
can work together and play

1600
01:10:59.592 --> 01:11:01.636
together.

1601
01:11:01.636 --> 01:11:02.512
What is your secret?

1602
01:11:05.015 --> 01:11:09.102
Communication.

1603
01:11:09.102 --> 01:11:10.937
What else?

1604
01:11:10.937 --> 01:11:12.188
Anna. please.

1605
01:11:12.188 --> 01:11:12.939
Let's just go.

1606
01:11:12.939 --> 01:11:14.315
This isn't me.

1607
01:11:14.315 --> 01:11:15.900
Please.

1608
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:16.860
I'm sorry.

1609
01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:21.948
Um. we're not married.

1610
01:11:21.948 --> 01:11:23.867
Marianne. Louis. I'm so sorry.

1611
01:11:23.867 --> 01:11:25.452
You've been so good to us.

1612
01:11:25.452 --> 01:11:28.830
And Durand is amazing and
impeccable and respectable.

1613
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:31.291
And we lied-- I lied.

1614
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:33.543
And that is not
me. so I'm sorry.

1615
01:11:37.714 --> 01:11:38.298
Anna.

1616
01:11:40.884 --> 01:11:42.802
Anna.

1617
01:11:42.802 --> 01:11:44.429
Anna. wait. please.

1618
01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:44.846
Anna. wait.

1619
01:11:49.684 --> 01:11:51.936
I'm sorry.

1620
01:11:51.936 --> 01:11:53.646
It's over.

1621
01:11:53.646 --> 01:11:57.150
Suffice to say. you no
longer have the contract.

1622
01:11:57.150 --> 01:12:02.322
{\an8}Marianne. Louis. ...

1623
01:12:02.322 --> 01:12:06.159
Was it not enough for you
to burn down the store?

1624
01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:09.287
You have disgraced
our family tonight.

1625
01:12:09.287 --> 01:12:11.289
When are you going
to grow up. Sebastian?

1626
01:12:11.289 --> 01:12:13.375
I'm sorry. Marianne and Louis.

1627
01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:17.712
Sebastian. I could
have died on the spot.

1628
01:12:17.712 --> 01:12:19.130
Sorry. Marianne.

1629
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.964
Sorry.

1630
01:12:27.972 --> 01:12:28.973
You're both fired.

1631
01:12:36.606 --> 01:12:43.780
We. um-- we will
smooth things over.

1632
01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:44.447
How?

1633
01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:50.286
You convinced me to go
along with this stupid lie.

1634
01:12:50.286 --> 01:12:52.706
And we just lost everything.

1635
01:12:52.706 --> 01:12:54.499
I lost everything.

1636
01:12:58.586 --> 01:13:01.798
Not everything.

1637
01:13:01.798 --> 01:13:08.054
How I feel about you. it's real.

1638
01:13:08.054 --> 01:13:09.681
This isn't real.

1639
01:13:09.681 --> 01:13:12.684
None of this was real!

1640
01:13:12.684 --> 01:13:13.601
Well. for me. it was.

1641
01:13:25.822 --> 01:13:27.073
Hi.

1642
01:13:27.073 --> 01:13:30.577
I need to book a
flight to New York.

1643
01:13:30.577 --> 01:13:31.286
For tomorrow.

1644
01:13:34.205 --> 01:13:34.789
Thank you.

1645
01:14:16.164 --> 01:14:20.669
Well. you certainly
got people talking.

1646
01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:22.420
I am so mortified.

1647
01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:24.631
Have you talked to Sebastian?

1648
01:14:24.631 --> 01:14:27.050
Well. I said some things to
him that were pretty harsh.

1649
01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:29.302
And then I blamed
him for everything

1650
01:14:29.302 --> 01:14:32.806
when I was the one who
got us into this mess.

1651
01:14:32.806 --> 01:14:33.682
Do you like him?

1652
01:14:38.395 --> 01:14:40.814
My heart says yes.

1653
01:14:40.814 --> 01:14:47.487
But I can't make the
same mistake twice.

1654
01:14:47.487 --> 01:14:54.077
Well. I like to think of
mistakes as little blessings.

1655
01:14:54.077 --> 01:14:57.789
And if you're smart.
which you are.

1656
01:14:57.789 --> 01:15:01.126
you won't make the
same mistake twice.

1657
01:15:01.126 --> 01:15:05.505
And you already know in here
if Sebastian is the right one.

1658
01:15:11.219 --> 01:15:12.387
I've got to get to work.

1659
01:15:12.387 --> 01:15:17.017
My star dachshund
is such a diva.

1660
01:15:17.017 --> 01:15:18.518
Are you going to be OK?

1661
01:15:18.518 --> 01:15:19.728
Yeah.

1662
01:15:19.728 --> 01:15:20.437
Yes. yes.

1663
01:15:20.437 --> 01:15:21.604
Are you sure?

1664
01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:22.939
I'm good.

1665
01:15:22.939 --> 01:15:23.690
You need to go.

1666
01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:24.691
Go.

1667
01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:25.525
OK. but what time
do you fly out?

1668
01:15:25.525 --> 01:15:26.359
Tonight.

1669
01:15:26.359 --> 01:15:27.402
I'll text you when I land.

1670
01:15:43.209 --> 01:15:46.463
Oh. you again.

1671
01:15:46.463 --> 01:15:48.381
Let me guess.

1672
01:15:48.381 --> 01:15:50.717
Anna hired you to be her friend.

1673
01:15:50.717 --> 01:15:53.553
No. no.

1674
01:15:53.553 --> 01:15:55.055
You know what they say.

1675
01:15:55.055 --> 01:16:00.810
The best things in life
are free. like this water.

1676
01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:02.062
Oh!

1677
01:16:02.062 --> 01:16:03.897
I'm such a clutz.

1678
01:16:03.897 --> 01:16:04.814
Have a nice day.

1679
01:16:22.707 --> 01:16:25.001
Bonjour.

1680
01:16:25.001 --> 01:16:26.127
Anna?

1681
01:16:26.127 --> 01:16:28.046
I have nothing to say to you.

1682
01:16:28.046 --> 01:16:31.174
I understand. but I am here
to apologize for everything

1683
01:16:31.174 --> 01:16:32.384
that happened last night.

1684
01:16:32.384 --> 01:16:33.551
It was my fault.

1685
01:16:33.551 --> 01:16:35.512
We find that hard to believe.

1686
01:16:35.512 --> 01:16:37.055
No. this is true.

1687
01:16:37.055 --> 01:16:40.558
Sebastian was just
trying to protect me.

1688
01:16:40.558 --> 01:16:42.185
He feels like you
guys only see him

1689
01:16:42.185 --> 01:16:44.479
for all the mistakes he's
made. not for any of the good

1690
01:16:44.479 --> 01:16:46.981
he's done.

1691
01:16:46.981 --> 01:16:48.608
Did he say that?

1692
01:16:48.608 --> 01:16:51.152
He loves you all so much.

1693
01:16:51.152 --> 01:16:53.279
He's sorry for what
happened last night

1694
01:16:53.279 --> 01:16:55.573
and for everything that
happened with your store.

1695
01:16:55.573 --> 01:16:58.410
He's a good man.

1696
01:16:58.410 --> 01:16:59.994
I really wish you
could see what I see.

1697
01:17:07.252 --> 01:17:08.086
Marianne.

1698
01:17:08.086 --> 01:17:09.004
OK.

1699
01:17:09.004 --> 01:17:09.421
Marianne.

1700
01:17:09.421 --> 01:17:10.255
No!

1701
01:17:10.964 --> 01:17:11.589
Marianne--

1702
01:17:11.589 --> 01:17:13.008
No. Sebastian!

1703
01:17:13.008 --> 01:17:14.551
No.

1704
01:17:14.551 --> 01:17:16.761
We said everything we
needed to say last night.

1705
01:17:16.761 --> 01:17:18.179
I know.

1706
01:17:18.179 --> 01:17:20.306
And I am truly sorry from
the bottom of my heart.

1707
01:17:20.306 --> 01:17:21.850
I am.

1708
01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:25.186
But. please. just
don't blame Anna.

1709
01:17:25.186 --> 01:17:26.438
Oh.

1710
01:17:26.438 --> 01:17:27.731
She honeymooned
in Paris with her ex

1711
01:17:27.731 --> 01:17:30.150
and inadvertently
said it was me.

1712
01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:32.444
I convinced her to go
along with it because I

1713
01:17:32.444 --> 01:17:34.946
wanted the account so badly.

1714
01:17:34.946 --> 01:17:38.450
And because I wanted
redemption even more. it just--

1715
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:39.743
it snowballed.

1716
01:17:39.743 --> 01:17:42.912
But Sebastian.
you both lied to us.

1717
01:17:42.912 --> 01:17:44.664
I know.

1718
01:17:44.664 --> 01:17:46.041
I messed up.

1719
01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:47.334
Yeah.

1720
01:17:47.334 --> 01:17:52.714
And it has cost me everything.

1721
01:17:52.714 --> 01:17:54.466
It caused me hell.

1722
01:17:54.466 --> 01:17:57.052
So you really care for her?

1723
01:18:00.388 --> 01:18:03.308
I do.

1724
01:18:03.308 --> 01:18:05.310
I think I love her.

1725
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:06.061
Did you tell her?

1726
01:18:08.855 --> 01:18:10.857
I don't think she'll
ever see me again.

1727
01:18:10.857 --> 01:18:14.361
Sebastian. no man
ever won over a woman

1728
01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:15.653
by thinking too much.

1729
01:18:15.653 --> 01:18:17.197
You need to find her.

1730
01:18:20.533 --> 01:18:21.284
Merci. Marianne.

1731
01:18:24.454 --> 01:18:25.080
Merci.

1732
01:18:35.882 --> 01:18:36.341
Hi.

1733
01:18:39.844 --> 01:18:42.389
I am so sorry
for what happened.

1734
01:18:42.389 --> 01:18:44.307
No. Andre. I'm so sorry.

1735
01:18:44.307 --> 01:18:45.600
Can I speak out of turn?

1736
01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.060
Of course.

1737
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.855
For what it's worth.
you two gave off a vibe

1738
01:18:50.855 --> 01:18:54.651
that most married
couples don't even have.

1739
01:18:54.651 --> 01:18:56.152
What do you mean?

1740
01:18:56.152 --> 01:19:00.657
Your connection was
understated. but genuine.

1741
01:19:00.657 --> 01:19:01.741
It was special.

1742
01:19:04.411 --> 01:19:05.537
No.

1743
01:19:05.537 --> 01:19:06.454
Thank you. Andre.

1744
01:19:10.917 --> 01:19:13.712
I would really love
to go for a walk.

1745
01:19:13.712 --> 01:19:15.547
Is there any way you
could watch my bags?

1746
01:19:15.547 --> 01:19:16.548
Of course. mademoiselle.

1747
01:19:16.548 --> 01:19:18.425
Whatever you want.

1748
01:19:18.425 --> 01:19:19.134
I'll be back.

1749
01:19:42.198 --> 01:19:45.785
Anna!

1750
01:19:45.785 --> 01:19:48.246
Anna. wait!

1751
01:19:48.246 --> 01:19:50.540
Sebastian?

1752
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.125
Anna. hi.

1753
01:19:56.046 --> 01:19:57.255
I'm sorry.

1754
01:19:57.255 --> 01:19:58.673
I'm sorry I got us fired.

1755
01:19:58.673 --> 01:19:59.424
I'm sorry.

1756
01:19:59.424 --> 01:20:01.217
No.

1757
01:20:01.217 --> 01:20:03.303
I spoke to my parents.

1758
01:20:03.303 --> 01:20:05.221
They told me what you said.

1759
01:20:05.221 --> 01:20:06.723
Did everything work out?

1760
01:20:06.723 --> 01:20:08.933
Things will be much better.

1761
01:20:08.933 --> 01:20:11.102
And Marianne just called.

1762
01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:13.188
She wants us back
on the account.

1763
01:20:13.188 --> 01:20:13.772
How?

1764
01:20:13.772 --> 01:20:15.774
We were fired.

1765
01:20:15.774 --> 01:20:19.652
We'll talk to Caroline.

1766
01:20:19.652 --> 01:20:24.449
No. we should
start our own agency.

1767
01:20:24.449 --> 01:20:26.159
I'm serious. if you want to.

1768
01:20:26.159 --> 01:20:27.160
I want to.

1769
01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:56.648
Sebastian. it's beautiful.

1770
01:20:56.648 --> 01:20:59.693
To celebrate us landing
my family's account.

1771
01:20:59.693 --> 01:21:01.778
Well. because they fell
in love with your ideas.

1772
01:21:01.778 --> 01:21:03.154
No. my love.

1773
01:21:03.154 --> 01:21:05.031
It's because they
fell in love with you.

1774
01:21:08.535 --> 01:21:10.537
I have something for you.

1775
01:21:10.537 --> 01:21:11.204
OK.

1776
01:21:16.584 --> 01:21:17.168
Open?

1777
01:21:17.168 --> 01:21:17.877
Please.

1778
01:21:22.257 --> 01:21:23.508
Macarons.

1779
01:21:23.508 --> 01:21:26.344
Pedestrian?

1780
01:21:26.344 --> 01:21:27.554
A little provincial.

1781
01:21:32.225 --> 01:21:34.978
Maybe this box.

1782
01:21:41.067 --> 01:21:42.777
Mm.

1783
01:21:42.777 --> 01:21:43.570
Thank you.

1784
01:21:47.282 --> 01:21:52.287
Anna Bowman. pretending
to be married to you

1785
01:21:52.287 --> 01:21:56.708
was the best
decision I ever made.

1786
01:21:56.708 --> 01:22:00.587
You make me want
to be a butter man.

1787
01:22:00.587 --> 01:22:05.508
That's because I know
how you like your croissants.

1788
01:22:05.508 --> 01:22:13.099
I'm sure I want to hang up
my towels with you every day

1789
01:22:13.099 --> 01:22:18.271
for the rest of my life.
no more pretending.

1790
01:22:22.692 --> 01:22:23.485
I'm sorry.

1791
01:22:23.485 --> 01:22:24.569
What was that?

1792
01:22:24.569 --> 01:22:26.863
I need help with my French.

1793
01:22:26.863 --> 01:22:28.448
Will you marry me?

1794
01:22:28.448 --> 01:22:29.074
Oui.

1795
01:22:42.504 --> 01:22:45.840
That was perfect.

1796
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:50.136
OK. when we first met. I really
did not understand him at all.

1797
01:22:50.136 --> 01:22:54.391
And I thought she
was predictable.

1798
01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:55.558
We had to go to Paris.

1799
01:22:55.558 --> 01:22:56.685
For work.

1800
01:22:56.685 --> 01:22:58.770
And pretend to
like each other.

1801
01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:00.438
We told people
we were married.

1802
01:23:00.438 --> 01:23:04.901
Oh. no. it was a horrible
fiasco. really a terrible lie.

1803
01:23:04.901 --> 01:23:06.027
Until it wasn't.

1804
01:23:06.027 --> 01:23:07.445
That's because he fell for me.

1805
01:23:07.445 --> 01:23:09.906
She couldn't resist
my charms forever.

1806
01:23:09.906 --> 01:23:12.867
No. you realized that
you needed my good sense.

1807
01:23:12.867 --> 01:23:14.160
It's true.

1808
01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.912
You are my better half.

1809
01:23:15.912 --> 01:23:17.664
And you are mine.

1810
01:23:17.664 --> 01:23:21.751
And then this happened.
