3
00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:17.295
Could you hand me my shirt. baby girl?
I oughta get going.

4
00:05:17.628 --> 00:05:20.836
Come on.
Stay a little longer.

5
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.003
What about round two?
- You for real?

6
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.336
What?

7
00:05:26.503 --> 00:05:30.628
You all outta mojo?
- Hell. you tryin' to kill me. woman?

8
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.336
Don't you want to stay with me?

9
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:40.295
You know it. baby girl.
But the goats need lovin'. too.

10
00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:43.253
Folks don't call me Goat Peter
for nothing.

11
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.878
Very funny.

12
00:05:46.503 --> 00:05:48.170
There you go.

13
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.586
Hey.

14
00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:21.336
Heidi!

15
00:06:23.003 --> 00:06:26.336
You've been visiting Goat Peter again!

16
00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:29.378
And how was your day?
- Look.

17
00:06:29.545 --> 00:06:33.503
That boy is trouble. I'm telling you.
- Here we go again.

18
00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:36.920
Boys his age.
they got one thing on their mind.

19
00:06:37.253 --> 00:06:40.420
So you just stay away from him
before you get hurt.

20
00:06:40.586 --> 00:06:44.003
I know.
but I just so happen to like him a lot.

21
00:06:44.586 --> 00:06:47.253
And I'm old enough
to make my own decisions.

22
00:06:48.878 --> 00:06:52.836
You know.
I only want what's best for you.

23
00:06:54.003 --> 00:06:56.128
You're all I have.

24
00:06:56.586 --> 00:06:58.378
Can we just eat. Grandfather?

25
00:07:11.086 --> 00:07:13.920
They say he's involved
in some shady business.

26
00:07:14.086 --> 00:07:16.461
They? Who's they?
- In the village!

27
00:07:16.628 --> 00:07:19.711
How about trusting
your own granddaughter's judgment

28
00:07:19.878 --> 00:07:22.420
instead of some old hag's gossip?
- Heidi!

29
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.378
You know what?
I'm not hungry anymore.

30
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:32.711
Goat Peter and I love each other.
And that's that.

31
00:07:38.003 --> 00:07:40.211
My dear. dear Heidi.

32
00:07:40.878 --> 00:07:42.670
If only you knew.

33
00:08:26.878 --> 00:08:27.920
You the guy?

34
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.878
I'm the guy. alright.

35
00:08:35.128 --> 00:08:37.711
Straight to business.
I like it.

36
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.461
Rich. creamy.

37
00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:55.461
smooth texture.

38
00:08:56.795 --> 00:08:57.920
exquisite taste.

39
00:08:58.253 --> 00:09:00.711
This goat cheese
is truly out of this world.

40
00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:04.045
Nothing like the crap
they used to sell in the cities.

41
00:09:09.378 --> 00:09:11.420
So it's true what they say about you.

42
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.795
Happy goats...

43
00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:16.836
make happy cheese.

44
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.336

Good work. Gutzweiler!
- Thank you. my Very Swiss Leader.

66
00:10:40.253 --> 00:10:42.378
I'm very proud of the results.

67
00:10:44.086 --> 00:10:47.003
It could definitely use
some sexy girls. though.

68
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:51.461
Okay. That is enough praise for today.
Anything else you have for me?

69
00:10:52.378 --> 00:10:54.961
Good news. sir. The French.

70
00:10:55.295 --> 00:10:57.878
They are ready to agree
to our export terms.

71
00:10:58.628 --> 00:10:59.753
But...

72
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.586
My Very Swiss Leader.

73
00:11:04.836 --> 00:11:06.128
I am...

74
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.878
You are one minute and 52 seconds late.

75
00:11:46.836 --> 00:11:49.753
This is not Swaziland.
This is Switzerland!

76
00:11:50.086 --> 00:11:51.836
My sincere apologies.

77
00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:53.461
Apologies?

78
00:11:54.753 --> 00:11:57.836
You are hereby relieved of your duties.
Guards!

79
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.003
Anyway. Where were we?

80
00:12:14.503 --> 00:12:16.045
The French. sir.

81
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:19.628
They insist on sending
a delegation of food inspectors

82
00:12:19.795 --> 00:12:23.961
to see if we meet their standards
before they make a final decision.

83
00:12:24.128 --> 00:12:27.711
You know the French.
They love their cheese.

84
00:12:28.253 --> 00:12:33.170
Those Brie-eating bastards
want to lecture me about cheese?

85
00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.670
Who do they think they are?

86
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:42.170
Maybe I should invite them
to the National Day celebration.

87
00:12:48.628 --> 00:12:52.420
So... how is the Ultra Swiss cheese
coming along?

88
00:12:52.586 --> 00:12:56.586
Ah. very good. sir. I think
you will be very pleased with the results.

89
00:12:57.045 --> 00:12:58.378
Good.

90
00:12:59.295 --> 00:13:01.170
First France...

91
00:13:03.003 --> 00:13:04.003
and then...

92
00:13:04.336 --> 00:13:05.420
the world!

93
00:13:23.295 --> 00:13:26.295
I heard someone ordered fondue.

94
00:13:27.628 --> 00:13:32.086
Oh. I love the smell of cheese
in the morning.

95
00:13:46.503 --> 00:13:50.420
That wasn't so bad. now. was it?

96
00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:52.295
Please.

97
00:13:53.045 --> 00:13:54.878
No more cheese.

98
00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:57.253
I can't take it.

99
00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:01.045
I am lactose intolerant.

100
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:03.503
Of course you are.

101
00:14:03.836 --> 00:14:05.545
You filthy foreign fuck!

102
00:14:06.586 --> 00:14:09.086
Well. who is your supplier?

103
00:14:10.378 --> 00:14:12.836
His name is G...

104
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.586
G... G... G...

105
00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:17.211
G... G... G... G... G... G...

106
00:14:17.378 --> 00:14:19.295
Goat Peter.

107
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:27.003
And where can we find this Goat Peter?

108
00:14:27.961 --> 00:14:29.545
The Alps.

109
00:14:30.086 --> 00:14:32.503
The village above Davos.

110
00:14:33.086 --> 00:14:35.170
Tomorrow.
Please.

111
00:14:36.003 --> 00:14:39.503
I told you what you want to know.

112
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.211
You promised to let me go.

113
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.170
I did. But first...

114
00:14:46.003 --> 00:14:48.836
How about some chocolate for dessert?

115
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.086
Goat Peter!

116
00:16:09.211 --> 00:16:10.336
There you go.

117
00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:18.128
Wait here. I'll be right back.

118
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.211
I love you. Goat Peter.

119
00:16:28.128 --> 00:16:30.253
I love you too. baby girl.

120
00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.211
Definitely our goat fucker.

121
00:17:02.378 --> 00:17:06.378
This man has been charged
with the production.

122
00:17:06.545 --> 00:17:09.878
sales and distribution
of illegal dairy products.

123
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:16.753
Let this be a lesson to you all.
Traitors get what they deserve.

124
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.961
Noooooo!

125
00:17:35.128 --> 00:17:37.336
And who might you be?

126
00:17:37.503 --> 00:17:39.420
Take her away!
- Come with us!

127
00:17:45.003 --> 00:17:47.336
Meili's gonna love this one.

128
00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.336
Don't let her get away. Quick!

129
00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:03.545
See. what did I tell you?
They've been down to the village again.

130
00:18:03.711 --> 00:18:06.670
Just wait 'til I give him
a piece of my mind.

131
00:18:18.086 --> 00:18:19.670
Grandfather!

132
00:18:41.211 --> 00:18:43.836
Did you really think
you could get away from me?

133
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.045
Leave the girl alone.

134
00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:51.795
Mind your own business. old man.
It's better for your health.

135
00:18:51.961 --> 00:18:54.211
I said... leave her alone. Knorr!

136
00:18:54.545 --> 00:18:56.920
Or I'll blow your fucking head off.

137
00:18:58.211 --> 00:19:00.503
Wait a minute. Alpöhi?

138
00:19:00.836 --> 00:19:03.586
Is it really you?
- You better believe it.

139
00:19:03.753 --> 00:19:06.753
Get on your merry way
and forget you ever saw the girl!

140
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.836
She's yours?
This just keeps getting better and better.

141
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:15.170
Final warning!

142
00:19:15.503 --> 00:19:18.378
Your pathetic rebellion
failed a long time ago.

143
00:19:23.711 --> 00:19:25.378
Grandfather!

144
00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.753
Don't bother.

145
00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.628
It's pointless.

146
00:20:28.295 --> 00:20:30.086
Where are they taking us?

147
00:20:32.128 --> 00:20:33.628
I don't know.

148
00:20:43.753 --> 00:20:45.253
My name is Klara.

149
00:20:48.295 --> 00:20:49.628
What's yours?

150
00:21:09.878 --> 00:21:11.628
Fräulein Rottweiler.

151
00:21:16.878 --> 00:21:18.586
This is the one.

152
00:21:20.086 --> 00:21:21.961
I'm rather unimpressed.

153
00:21:22.503 --> 00:21:25.711
Meili is gonna love her.
You'll see.

154
00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:29.795
Is that so?

155
00:21:33.253 --> 00:21:34.503
Lutz!

156
00:21:39.295 --> 00:21:42.128
You are now property of the Fatherland.

157
00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:45.670
Welcome to Camp Alpenblick!

158
00:21:58.336 --> 00:21:59.420
Next.

159
00:22:00.253 --> 00:22:01.253
Next.

160
00:22:03.503 --> 00:22:04.628
Next.

161
00:22:08.378 --> 00:22:10.003
Well...

162
00:22:12.295 --> 00:22:13.836
Open up.

163
00:22:24.545 --> 00:22:27.128
As suspected.
Lactose intolerant.

164
00:22:33.295 --> 00:22:34.295
Guards!

165
00:22:37.253 --> 00:22:39.253
Never mind that one.

166
00:22:48.753 --> 00:22:50.378
Good. Next.

167
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.295
Well. hello.

168
00:23:02.836 --> 00:23:06.003
Open!
- I'm fine. thank you very much.

169
00:23:07.045 --> 00:23:08.961
Don't worry.
You're in good hands.

170
00:23:17.211 --> 00:23:20.836
I see. Spirited. aren't you. huh?

171
00:23:23.045 --> 00:23:27.336
I could do this all day long.
What about you?

172
00:23:29.503 --> 00:23:31.128
Watch out.

173
00:23:51.503 --> 00:23:55.503
The way you were resisting. I was certain
that you would be intolerant.

174
00:24:16.336 --> 00:24:19.003
Oh. Fresh meat.

175
00:24:24.211 --> 00:24:25.795
Just ignore them.

176
00:24:31.253 --> 00:24:33.045
This is Rosie.

177
00:24:33.628 --> 00:24:35.753
She's all bite and no bark.

178
00:24:38.003 --> 00:24:42.545
Me and you. we're going to have
a real good time together.

179
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:43.711
<i>Quiet in there!</i>

180
00:24:49.711 --> 00:24:51.045
<i>Lights out!</i>

181
00:25:06.586 --> 00:25:08.711
I'm gonna make them pay.

182
00:25:09.545 --> 00:25:11.045
I promise you.

183
00:25:27.211 --> 00:25:29.378
I'm scared. Aren't you?

184
00:25:33.211 --> 00:25:35.128
I gotta get out of here.

185
00:25:36.045 --> 00:25:39.628
We gotta get out of here.
We gotta come up with something.

186
00:25:40.795 --> 00:25:42.461
Klara. you hear me?

187
00:25:44.628 --> 00:25:46.545
We need to stick together.

188
00:25:50.211 --> 00:25:53.211
Even if we managed
to sneak past the guards.

189
00:25:53.378 --> 00:25:55.211
how would we make it out of here?

190
00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.003
I mean... We don't even know where we are.

191
00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:01.795
We'll find a way.

192
00:26:02.503 --> 00:26:03.503
We have to.

193
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.003
<i>Quiet!</i>

194
00:26:09.753 --> 00:26:11.253
Good night. Klara.

195
00:26:12.461 --> 00:26:13.753
Good night.

196
00:26:26.753 --> 00:26:28.711
Good morning. ladies.

197
00:26:29.295 --> 00:26:31.711
Good morning. Fräulein Rottweiler!

198
00:26:32.836 --> 00:26:34.586
Congratulations.

199
00:26:34.753 --> 00:26:36.295
new arrivals.

200
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.170
You are the chosen ones!

201
00:26:39.878 --> 00:26:41.586
As you all know...

202
00:26:41.753 --> 00:26:46.295
Schwingen.
also known as Alpine Wrestling.

203
00:26:46.628 --> 00:26:49.961
is our nation's most popular sport.

204
00:26:50.586 --> 00:26:53.670
Today you begin your training!

205
00:26:55.128 --> 00:26:56.295
Lutz!

206
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.086
As there are some newbies here.

207
00:26:59.628 --> 00:27:01.503
we'll start with the basics.

208
00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:07.503
You!

209
00:27:13.003 --> 00:27:14.253
And you.

210
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.795
Into the ring!

211
00:27:23.753 --> 00:27:26.711
We start
with the basic moves of Schwingen!

212
00:27:26.878 --> 00:27:30.878
The "kurz" is the most commonly used grip
on the Schwing court.

213
00:27:31.628 --> 00:27:32.628
Go!

214
00:27:53.128 --> 00:27:56.045
Enough! You're going to kill her!
- Alright!

215
00:27:56.461 --> 00:27:57.961
Get back in line!

216
00:28:03.378 --> 00:28:05.420
Let's see if there's some talent

217
00:28:05.586 --> 00:28:07.753
behind that big mouth of yours.

218
00:28:08.961 --> 00:28:09.961
You.

219
00:28:18.545 --> 00:28:20.961
The next move is the "wyberhaagge".

220
00:28:21.628 --> 00:28:24.128
Not only because of its name.

221
00:28:24.295 --> 00:28:27.253
it is one of the more spectacular swings.

222
00:28:30.461 --> 00:28:32.545
I told you we're gonna have fun.

223
00:28:55.086 --> 00:28:58.336
Found any fishes down there?
No? Check again!

224
00:29:04.878 --> 00:29:07.128
Attention! Stand straight.

225
00:29:12.378 --> 00:29:14.711
You. you. you. Out!

226
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:19.711
We'll continue the swimming lessons
tomorrow. Bambi.

227
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.045
I present to you our Very Swiss Leader.
President Meili.

228
00:30:01.586 --> 00:30:04.003
Oh. That is what it's like.

229
00:30:05.045 --> 00:30:08.545
Not too shabby at all.
I'm starting to like this place.

230
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.128
Anyway. Knorrli!

231
00:30:11.295 --> 00:30:12.878
It's Kommandant Knorr!

232
00:30:14.253 --> 00:30:16.711
That's the one.
Maienfeld. Adelheid.

233
00:30:16.878 --> 00:30:18.628
24 years old.

234
00:30:19.003 --> 00:30:21.086
Granddaughter of Alpöhi.

235
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.503
Recently deceased.
I took care of that personally...

236
00:30:33.795 --> 00:30:36.961
Ooh! Quite the lively one.

237
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:41.086
I like that look on your face.

238
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:45.878
That starry-eyed cluelessness
one only find in the Alps.

239
00:30:47.461 --> 00:30:48.586
Perfect.

240
00:30:54.378 --> 00:30:58.003
I am positively surprised.
Kommandant Knorr.

241
00:30:58.795 --> 00:31:01.586
I did not expect that from you.

242
00:31:02.253 --> 00:31:07.295
Anyway. I have got important things to do.
Cow business. if you know what I mean.

243
00:31:12.336 --> 00:31:13.711
The girl.

244
00:31:13.878 --> 00:31:18.670
I want her to be the main attraction.
This'll be the best Schwing fest in years.

245
00:31:19.128 --> 00:31:21.170
Of course. sir. I have...

246
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:02.295
I've had it with cheese.

247
00:32:03.295 --> 00:32:05.170
Isn't there anything else?

248
00:32:05.503 --> 00:32:07.503
Oh. let me check.

249
00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.878
Oh. no. Just cheese.
Take it or leave it.

250
00:32:15.003 --> 00:32:17.378
<i>All prisoners pick up your meals.</i>

251
00:32:30.045 --> 00:32:31.670
What's the problem. Bambi?

252
00:32:31.836 --> 00:32:34.003
I'm not eating that crap.

253
00:32:34.336 --> 00:32:37.295
Ooh. Are you suddenly lactose intolerant?

254
00:32:42.128 --> 00:32:45.045
Stuff your fat faces
with that garbage all you want.

255
00:32:45.378 --> 00:32:48.170
I'd rather starve to death
than end up as one of you.

256
00:32:51.336 --> 00:32:53.753
Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

257
00:33:08.545 --> 00:33:10.836
Anyone else wants some?

258
00:33:13.795 --> 00:33:15.253
And these two...

259
00:33:16.295 --> 00:33:17.461
Take 'em away!

260
00:33:49.086 --> 00:33:53.128
How the hell did she get that in here?

261
00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:58.336
I have had it
with your sloppy strip searches.

262
00:33:58.503 --> 00:34:00.378
I expect better.

263
00:34:00.961 --> 00:34:03.461
Yes. ma'am. Fräulein Rottweiler.

264
00:34:13.086 --> 00:34:16.086
Oh. is that how you want to play it?

265
00:34:16.878 --> 00:34:18.170
Very well!

266
00:34:18.503 --> 00:34:23.003
In just a few days. you'll be
on your knees. begging for cheese.

267
00:35:00.336 --> 00:35:04.461
<i>In Switzerland. in Switzerland
In Switzerland...</i>

268
00:35:35.586 --> 00:35:37.670
What a pain in the ass!

269
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:41.670
Woof. woof. woof.

270
00:35:41.836 --> 00:35:43.336
Pugsie!

271
00:35:43.503 --> 00:35:45.378
Woof. woof. woof. woof. woof.

272
00:35:45.545 --> 00:35:48.086
You truly are insatiable. hm?

273
00:35:48.545 --> 00:35:50.128
Woof. woof. woof. woof.

274
00:35:50.461 --> 00:35:51.878
Very well.

275
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.961
Smell that?

276
00:36:19.128 --> 00:36:23.003
All the delicious cheese.

277
00:36:33.795 --> 00:36:35.545
Till tomorrow!

278
00:36:48.045 --> 00:36:51.211
<i>You've been visiting Goat Peter again.</i>

279
00:36:51.378 --> 00:36:54.545
<i>Lunch is getting cold.</i>

280
00:37:00.045 --> 00:37:01.878
<i>Smell that?</i>

281
00:37:02.211 --> 00:37:04.420
<i>I love you. too. baby girl.</i>

282
00:37:04.586 --> 00:37:06.003
<i>Delicious cheese...</i>

283
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.420
What are you staring at?

284
00:37:07.586 --> 00:37:08.711
<i>Delicious cheese.</i>

285
00:37:09.045 --> 00:37:10.795
<i>Lunch is getting cold.</i>

286
00:37:11.711 --> 00:37:13.503
<i>Don't you want some?</i>

287
00:37:31.836 --> 00:37:33.586
Grandfather?

288
00:37:57.753 --> 00:37:58.961
For fuck's sake!

289
00:37:59.586 --> 00:38:02.003
I should have you all arrested.

290
00:38:03.336 --> 00:38:06.128
I'm sure it's just a...
- matter of logistics.

291
00:38:06.295 --> 00:38:10.795
That is what you told me the last time.
Yet here we are. you've nothing to show.

292
00:38:12.086 --> 00:38:13.961
Some more milk.

293
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.128
My Very Swiss Leader.

294
00:38:24.461 --> 00:38:27.920
I promise you.
your new Ultra Swiss cheese

295
00:38:28.086 --> 00:38:31.670
will be ready
in time for Swiss National Day.

296
00:38:32.961 --> 00:38:34.503
It better be

297
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:38.128
because you are hanging
on a really thin thread.

298
00:38:38.461 --> 00:38:39.545
Schwitzgebel!

299
00:38:41.545 --> 00:38:43.253
Speaking of Swiss National Day...

300
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.836
How is the mountain girl doing?
- Oh...

301
00:38:48.128 --> 00:38:51.295
Very promising.
You were right to choose her.

302
00:38:52.086 --> 00:38:56.711
Good. You would not disappoint me.
would you. Knorrli?

303
00:38:57.878 --> 00:39:00.545
I wouldn't dare. sir. You know me.

304
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:04.795
I do indeed.

305
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:08.628
Gentlemen.

306
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:14.253
To world domination!
- To world domination!

307
00:39:26.336 --> 00:39:27.753
Rottweiler.

308
00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.961
Finally!
Meili is getting impatient.

309
00:39:31.128 --> 00:39:35.211
If the girl doesn't deliver at the fest.
he'll have our heads on a platter.

310
00:39:36.295 --> 00:39:39.420
You are giving me orders. Pugsie?

311
00:39:39.586 --> 00:39:40.836
Damn right I am.

312
00:39:41.336 --> 00:39:45.378
That almost sounds
like you are questioning my abilities.

313
00:39:45.545 --> 00:39:47.545
I don't care how you do it.

314
00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:49.753
Just make it happen!

315
00:39:59.045 --> 00:40:00.503
You know...

316
00:40:00.836 --> 00:40:02.586
I'm so glad...

317
00:40:04.128 --> 00:40:05.753
that you didn't listen.

318
00:40:09.211 --> 00:40:10.753
Because...

319
00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:12.795
I'm going to enjoy this...

320
00:40:13.545 --> 00:40:15.461
very much.

321
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.045
It's party time. bitch.

322
00:41:05.836 --> 00:41:09.003
I think she's had enough.

323
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:12.003
Give us a minute. will you?

324
00:41:21.503 --> 00:41:25.128
You know...
I'm not as bad as you think I am.

325
00:41:26.128 --> 00:41:30.420
I really do care about my girls.
especially you. Heidi.

326
00:41:30.586 --> 00:41:33.045
I only want what's best for you.

327
00:41:34.545 --> 00:41:39.045
Sometimes that requires
a little bit of tough love.

328
00:41:39.378 --> 00:41:42.586
But tough love is still love.

329
00:41:42.753 --> 00:41:44.586
Wouldn't you agree?

330
00:41:46.086 --> 00:41:50.128
Anyway. I've got you a little something...

331
00:41:50.795 --> 00:41:52.086
to cheer you up.

332
00:42:00.628 --> 00:42:05.086
Now how about you have
a little something to eat? Hmm?

333
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.711
What do you say?

334
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:16.378
Such a good girl.

335
00:42:38.628 --> 00:42:40.795
I'm not a good girl anymore.

336
00:42:51.711 --> 00:42:52.711
Time to leave.

337
00:42:56.545 --> 00:42:58.711
Why?
- I got keys.

338
00:42:59.045 --> 00:43:00.045
Cheese?

339
00:43:00.378 --> 00:43:03.253
No. keys!
We can finally get the hell out of here!

340
00:43:03.586 --> 00:43:06.086
But it's going to be breakfast soon.

341
00:43:06.461 --> 00:43:07.920
Wait. what?

342
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:11.545
What the hell are you on about?
We gotta hurry.

343
00:43:11.711 --> 00:43:13.670
I need my daily cheese

344
00:43:13.836 --> 00:43:16.461
so I can be big and strong...

345
00:43:16.628 --> 00:43:20.753
and become Switzerland's next top
Schwinger for our Very Swiss Leader.

346
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:24.128
For fuck's sake. Klara. snap out of it!

347
00:43:28.086 --> 00:43:29.295
Fuck!

348
00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:37.086
Goddamn it. Klara. get up!
I can't do this alone!

349
00:43:37.836 --> 00:43:39.295
I'm leaving.

350
00:43:40.628 --> 00:43:42.336
I'll fix this. I promise.

351
00:44:04.128 --> 00:44:05.628
Ruthli!

352
00:44:57.086 --> 00:44:58.628
This way!

353
00:45:24.545 --> 00:45:28.253
There's nowhere for you to run. Heidi.

354
00:45:29.628 --> 00:45:32.836
Unless you want to join
the rest of your family.

355
00:45:34.586 --> 00:45:35.836
What?

356
00:45:41.211 --> 00:45:43.545
Your grandfather never told you?

357
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:48.461
I made sure your parents
got what they deserve.

358
00:45:49.253 --> 00:45:51.836
And now it's your turn.

359
00:45:52.003 --> 00:45:55.128
It would be my pleasure to reunite you

360
00:45:55.461 --> 00:45:58.711
and to once again see
that look on a face I saw

361
00:45:58.878 --> 00:46:04.420
when I drained the life out of
your whore mother and your deadbeat dad.

362
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:09.045
All your sheltered life in the mountains

363
00:46:09.211 --> 00:46:12.378
still led your right into my arms.

364
00:46:12.545 --> 00:46:15.878
You know. personally.
I couldn't give a rat's ass

365
00:46:16.211 --> 00:46:19.211
how much Meili
wants you at his Schwing fest.

366
00:46:21.003 --> 00:46:23.545
So. which will it be?

367
00:46:32.045 --> 00:46:34.628
You do not control my destiny.

368
00:46:39.795 --> 00:46:41.253
God damn her!

369
00:47:03.545 --> 00:47:05.753
Knorrli. I did not expect you here today.

370
00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.545
I've got some unfortunate news
that I wanted to tell you in person. sir.

371
00:47:12.586 --> 00:47:14.586
It's the mountain girl. Heidi.

372
00:47:16.461 --> 00:47:18.420
Get to the point.
I haven't got all day.

373
00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.086
She's dead.

374
00:47:23.045 --> 00:47:24.378
She's what?

375
00:47:25.045 --> 00:47:26.670
Killed herself.

376
00:47:27.961 --> 00:47:30.003
Un-fucking-believable!

377
00:47:31.461 --> 00:47:34.503
How could you let this happen?
You incompetent fuck!

378
00:47:34.836 --> 00:47:38.211
How hard can it be.
guarding a fucking girl?

379
00:47:38.545 --> 00:47:40.836
We couldn't...
- Shut the fuck up!

380
00:47:41.253 --> 00:47:43.336
We will deal with this later.

381
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:09.211
My Very Swiss Leader. it's a great honor
to show you the culmination of my work:

382
00:50:09.545 --> 00:50:10.628
Meili's

383
00:50:10.961 --> 00:50:11.961
Ultra

384
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.170
Swiss.

385
00:50:14.003 --> 00:50:17.670
None of this would be possible
without your brilliant plan

386
00:50:17.836 --> 00:50:20.878
for the future of Switz...
- Blow that smoke up your own ass.

387
00:50:21.503 --> 00:50:25.378
Are we going to see results or not?
- Of course. my Very Swiss Leader.

388
00:50:31.545 --> 00:50:33.045
Oh. hello there.

389
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:35.211
Cheesemaster.

390
00:50:36.961 --> 00:50:40.545
I managed to increase
the lactose proportion

391
00:50:40.878 --> 00:50:44.670
to no less than 88%.

392
00:50:45.461 --> 00:50:46.961
With this new formula.

393
00:50:47.295 --> 00:50:51.336
we can not only reach peak muscle mass
upon short term consumption.

394
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:54.128
but also peak cerebral softening.

395
00:50:54.461 --> 00:50:57.503
which will result
in near total lack of linguistic skills

396
00:50:57.836 --> 00:51:00.295
and renders the consumer

397
00:51:00.628 --> 00:51:02.836
unconditionally obedient.

398
00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:09.836
Good God.
spare me the scientific mumbo jumbo!

399
00:51:10.461 --> 00:51:13.211
Try speaking
like a normal person for once.

400
00:51:13.378 --> 00:51:15.336
Well. as you would put it. sir.

401
00:51:15.878 --> 00:51:18.420
it's going to make everyone dumb as fuck.

402
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:22.253
Talk is cheap. Show me!
- Of course. my Very Swiss Leader.

403
00:51:23.253 --> 00:51:27.836
Kari here will have the honor
to sample the new Ultra Swiss.

404
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:40.628
Oh...
- Go ahead. Kari.

405
00:51:49.003 --> 00:51:51.295
Unbelievably delicious.

406
00:51:52.795 --> 00:51:54.961
Best I've ever eaten.

407
00:51:59.003 --> 00:52:00.878
Well. don't stop now.

408
00:52:01.045 --> 00:52:03.086
It's... But it's...

409
00:52:05.586 --> 00:52:06.878
It's...

410
00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:08.545
It's what?

411
00:52:10.545 --> 00:52:11.586
Come on. spill it!

412
00:52:13.211 --> 00:52:15.211
Cerebral softening. sir.

413
00:52:16.753 --> 00:52:18.420
You also said obedience.

414
00:52:19.086 --> 00:52:20.586
I did indeed. Try it.

415
00:52:23.336 --> 00:52:24.711
Stand straight.

416
00:52:32.836 --> 00:52:34.878
Show me how strong you are.

417
00:52:38.836 --> 00:52:42.211
What. what. what. what? No!

418
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.545
M... Meili! Do something!
- Not him. you idiot!

419
00:53:07.836 --> 00:53:10.836
Sir. I... I'm terribly sorry.

420
00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:13.128
I promise you. I...
- I...

421
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:18.170
love it!

422
00:53:19.461 --> 00:53:21.878
You crazy genius!

423
00:53:23.295 --> 00:53:27.003
You've created
the perfect Swiss super soldier!

424
00:53:38.295 --> 00:53:42.545
I guess the position
for propaganda minister just opened up.

425
00:53:48.461 --> 00:53:51.211
Sir. You can't be serious.

426
00:53:51.545 --> 00:53:53.753
This thing is supposed to be a soldier?

427
00:53:54.086 --> 00:53:56.295
I don't see how...
- Of course you don't.

428
00:53:56.461 --> 00:53:59.670
You and your soldiers
can't even handle a little girl.

429
00:54:00.628 --> 00:54:03.211
The future is now. old man!

430
00:54:06.545 --> 00:54:08.961
Produce as much of it as you can!

431
00:54:09.753 --> 00:54:12.420
Of course. my Very Swiss Leader.

432
00:54:23.086 --> 00:54:26.295
You may leave whenever you please.

433
00:54:26.628 --> 00:54:29.086
The weapons. they stay.

434
00:54:48.503 --> 00:54:52.711
I am Helvetia. Guardian of the Motherland.

435
00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:58.503
Lust for vengeance
flows through your veins.

436
00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:01.545
Many things you shall learn.
young cub.

437
00:55:12.378 --> 00:55:13.545
Forget joy.

438
00:55:13.878 --> 00:55:15.545
forget sorrow.

439
00:55:15.711 --> 00:55:18.253
forget love. forget hate.

440
00:55:18.836 --> 00:55:21.378
Follow the whispering leaves

441
00:55:21.545 --> 00:55:24.920
and the call of the mountain goat.

442
00:55:32.961 --> 00:55:36.378
Meili's blood's gonna boil
when he sees that one.

443
00:55:38.753 --> 00:55:41.461
I hope he gets
a motherfucking heart attack.

444
00:55:45.086 --> 00:55:47.670
Easy now! It's only me.

445
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:50.795
Alpöhi?

446
00:55:54.711 --> 00:55:59.711
You got some nerve showing up
on my doorstep after all these years.

447
00:56:03.795 --> 00:56:05.545
Knorr killed your boy.

448
00:56:07.128 --> 00:56:09.420
What the hell you talkin' about?

449
00:56:11.795 --> 00:56:12.836
Goat Peter?

450
00:56:17.795 --> 00:56:19.545
My beautiful boy?

451
00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:23.920
And now he's after my Heidi.
so I'm going to kill the bastard.

452
00:56:24.086 --> 00:56:26.045
And I need your help.

453
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:33.003
You want us three old guys to...
go after Knorr.

454
00:56:34.253 --> 00:56:37.211
without even knowing where to go.
or what we're up against?

455
00:56:37.545 --> 00:56:39.295
Is this what you're saying?

456
00:56:41.336 --> 00:56:42.753
Exactly.

457
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:46.295
Alright...

458
00:56:47.295 --> 00:56:50.628
let's go tear that motherfucker
a new asshole.

459
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:49.545
I knew I'd find you in here.
As predictable as a good old Swiss watch.

460
01:00:50.295 --> 01:00:51.670
My Very Swiss Leader.

461
01:00:52.003 --> 01:00:56.878
Stop moping around. Knorrli.
There's plenty enough boots left to lick.

462
01:00:57.753 --> 01:01:00.795
You actually look pretty good
sitting behind that desk.

463
01:01:00.961 --> 01:01:04.461
Who knows. I might have to "promote" you
to prison warden.

464
01:01:05.003 --> 01:01:06.003
What?

465
01:01:06.336 --> 01:01:08.920
Relax! I'm just fucking with you.

466
01:01:10.878 --> 01:01:15.670
Although... I did tell you
to not disappoint me. remember?

467
01:01:16.378 --> 01:01:18.045
Of course. sir.

468
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.461
My staff informed me that these are
the two most promising candidates.

469
01:01:26.503 --> 01:01:27.836
That's it.

470
01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:30.170
Those two?
Is this your idea of a joke?

471
01:01:30.503 --> 01:01:35.128
They are fierce warriors and more than...
- I wanted the fucking mountain girl.

472
01:01:35.295 --> 01:01:38.003
You let her get away.
- She didn't get away.

473
01:01:38.336 --> 01:01:40.170
She died.
- Whatever. Knorrli.

474
01:01:40.336 --> 01:01:43.961
This year's fest was destined
for the history books. Now it's just...

475
01:01:44.503 --> 01:01:48.086
Sir. there is a soldier
who insists on speaking to you.

476
01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.586
Herr... Herr Kommandant!

477
01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.045
Herr Kommandant.

478
01:01:57.253 --> 01:01:59.753
Our patrol was attacked.

479
01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.128
We didn't stand a chance.

480
01:02:03.836 --> 01:02:07.170
Get a grip on yourself. soldier.
Now what happened?

481
01:02:07.336 --> 01:02:10.670
We were... just finishing lunch.

482
01:02:11.878 --> 01:02:14.378
Suddenly there was this noise.

483
01:02:34.253 --> 01:02:36.128
That's not a weapon.

484
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.003
This is.

485
01:02:41.545 --> 01:02:44.920
She... She left me alive
to give you a message.

486
01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:46.878
She?

487
01:02:47.253 --> 01:02:48.336
She said...

488
01:02:48.961 --> 01:02:50.503
Death to the Fatherland!

489
01:03:00.003 --> 01:03:01.670
Knorrli!

490
01:03:04.086 --> 01:03:06.170
Are you telling me she did this?

491
01:03:07.586 --> 01:03:09.628
The fucking mountain girl?

492
01:03:09.795 --> 01:03:12.211
Not only is she not dead.

493
01:03:12.545 --> 01:03:15.378
she's also massacring
your goddamn soldiers?

494
01:03:16.211 --> 01:03:19.211
This is your last goddamn chance.

495
01:03:19.795 --> 01:03:21.336
You better fucking fix this!

496
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.170
Summon the Neutralizer.

497
01:03:54.753 --> 01:03:56.961
I'm out of ink.

498
01:03:57.961 --> 01:04:00.670
<i>Just take the ink pad
from the other stamp.</i>

499
01:04:01.211 --> 01:04:03.128
What other stamp?

500
01:04:21.628 --> 01:04:23.045
Right away.

501
01:04:44.586 --> 01:04:48.003
Long live our Very Swiss Leader.
- Alright. fuck off!

502
01:04:57.295 --> 01:04:58.836
Got you. fucker!

503
01:05:08.836 --> 01:05:11.295
Right. This should be the last one.

504
01:05:12.003 --> 01:05:14.253
Time for a break.
- Well. well. well...

505
01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:17.628
Something's yodeling in my pants.

506
01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:23.003
I wouldn't push her off my bed.
that's for sure.

507
01:05:26.003 --> 01:05:28.836
I heard she took down an entire squad.

508
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:31.670
I wish I could be the one to find her.

509
01:05:32.336 --> 01:05:36.878
I'd teach her some real good manners.
if you know what I mean.

510
01:05:38.086 --> 01:05:41.336
That's some real big talk
for such puny little boys.

511
01:05:41.503 --> 01:05:44.461
Ha! It's my lucky day!

512
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.961
Yodel me this!

513
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:19.461
Now that's what I call a swan song.

514
01:06:24.878 --> 01:06:27.545
You're coming with me!

515
01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.878
What the fuck are you supposed to be?

516
01:07:15.211 --> 01:07:16.795
Bonjour. gentlemen.

517
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:20.711
It is my great honor to welcome you
to our National Day festivities.

518
01:07:20.878 --> 01:07:24.628
Bonjour. monsieur le president.
on behalf of myself and my colleagues.

519
01:07:24.795 --> 01:07:29.253
let me extend our sincere appreciation
for inviting us to this event.

520
01:07:32.503 --> 01:07:36.170
<i>Mon pleasure</i>. It is a great opportunity
to celebrate the dawn of a new era.

521
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:41.753
But for now. relax. eat.

522
01:07:42.086 --> 01:07:44.170
We will discuss business later.

523
01:07:45.878 --> 01:07:47.836
Super. Splendid.
- Excellent.

524
01:07:51.711 --> 01:07:53.836
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

525
01:07:54.795 --> 01:07:57.086
<i>give it up to our...</i>

526
01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.586
Very Swiss Leader. President Meili!

527
01:08:04.711 --> 01:08:08.128
Happy Swiss National Day. dear citizens.

528
01:08:09.295 --> 01:08:15.253
Today we shall celebrate
20 years of Switzerland's new order!

529
01:08:17.003 --> 01:08:18.961
<i>The Meili era!</i>

530
01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:22.378
<i>Not even the sky shall be the limit...</i>

531
01:08:22.545 --> 01:08:23.795
Hey. Klara!

532
01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:29.378
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

533
01:08:30.586 --> 01:08:35.461
<i>I now present you
the first Schwing fight of today.</i>

534
01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:37.545
<i>Klara!</i>

535
01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.461
<i>Versus...</i>

536
01:08:41.795 --> 01:08:44.420
Rosie and Flora!

537
01:09:02.253 --> 01:09:05.253
Let the festivities begin!

538
01:09:27.628 --> 01:09:28.961
Yeah!

539
01:09:39.086 --> 01:09:42.253
And now. ladies and gentlemen.
allow me to present

540
01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:44.420
today's main attraction.

541
01:09:44.586 --> 01:09:47.253
<i>A traitor to her own country.</i>

542
01:09:47.586 --> 01:09:50.336
The rebel spawn: Heeidiii!

543
01:09:52.753 --> 01:09:55.420
To honor this special occasion.

544
01:09:55.586 --> 01:10:01.045
this fight will be carried out
using only traditional Swiss weapons.

545
01:10:27.795 --> 01:10:30.753
Guys! We don't have to do this.

546
01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:33.795
Shut up and fight. traitor!

547
01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.670
Look what you made me do. bitch!

548
01:11:07.545 --> 01:11:09.753
Do it!
- Don't you see?

549
01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.670
We're in this together. for fuck's sake.
I am not the enemy. They are.

550
01:11:17.753 --> 01:11:19.628
Faster. pussycat.

551
01:11:19.961 --> 01:11:23.086
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

552
01:11:23.253 --> 01:11:26.711
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

553
01:11:27.295 --> 01:11:29.170
What is she waiting for?

554
01:11:29.503 --> 01:11:31.586
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

555
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.586
Just fucking do it. mountain girl!
It's not like I've ever been nice to you!

556
01:11:37.086 --> 01:11:38.711
Alright. enough of this!

557
01:11:50.753 --> 01:11:53.878
It's time to wake up. people!

558
01:11:55.628 --> 01:11:57.545
Look at yourselves!

559
01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:01.045
You're blindly following Meili
and his crooks!

560
01:12:02.295 --> 01:12:04.670
All that cheese clogged your brain cells.

561
01:12:05.003 --> 01:12:07.128
What about your dignity?

562
01:12:07.461 --> 01:12:09.961
Your fucking freedom?

563
01:12:10.461 --> 01:12:15.170
Don't you remember how things were before?
The lives you lived.

564
01:12:16.461 --> 01:12:18.295
The ones you loved?

565
01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:21.461
All of that is gone now.

566
01:12:22.295 --> 01:12:26.253
replaced by the shallow vision
of a spoilt man-child!

567
01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:30.586
Is that really what you want?

568
01:12:36.086 --> 01:12:39.586
Oh. for fuck's sake. people. wake up!

569
01:12:40.628 --> 01:12:43.420
What are you gonna do now. mountain girl?

570
01:12:45.003 --> 01:12:47.961
I'm coming for you! You fucking bastard!

571
01:12:49.711 --> 01:12:52.503
All part of the show.
All part of the show.

572
01:12:54.211 --> 01:12:56.128
Do something. Knorrli!

573
01:12:57.586 --> 01:12:59.336
Send him in!

574
01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.378
Say goodbye to your little friends.

575
01:15:10.003 --> 01:15:12.461
We're in this together. remember?

576
01:15:59.211 --> 01:16:02.128
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

577
01:16:25.753 --> 01:16:27.586
Are you happy now?

578
01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:33.503
Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!

579
01:16:35.461 --> 01:16:38.378
Gentlemen. gentlemen. gentlemen...

580
01:16:38.545 --> 01:16:40.961
it's time for the factory tour.

581
01:16:41.128 --> 01:16:44.711
Monsieur le president. we cannot
leave now! This Heidi is amazing!

582
01:16:45.045 --> 01:16:48.045
My heart is melting
like butter on a baguette!

583
01:16:48.378 --> 01:16:52.920
Forget about her. The real highlight
is yet to come! Now please. follow me!

584
01:16:53.253 --> 01:16:55.545
Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!

585
01:17:06.378 --> 01:17:08.045
Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!

586
01:17:31.003 --> 01:17:35.003
There is no escaping fate.
No escaping me.

587
01:17:36.211 --> 01:17:38.503
You know. given the circumstances.

588
01:17:38.836 --> 01:17:42.336
I'd say we've actually had
quite some fun together.

589
01:17:43.003 --> 01:17:44.878
Don't you think so?

590
01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:49.420
But as you know.
all good things must come to an end.

591
01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:51.128
I'm not done with you.

592
01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.503
Citizens.

593
01:17:55.836 --> 01:17:59.253
behold the fate that awaits a traitor.

594
01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:05.295
Say hello to your rotten family

595
01:18:05.628 --> 01:18:08.128
when you join them in hell!

596
01:18:11.545 --> 01:18:13.795
Oh. not again!

597
01:18:25.753 --> 01:18:26.753
Shoot them!

598
01:19:07.753 --> 01:19:10.378
You fucked with the wrong Heidi!

599
01:19:12.545 --> 01:19:15.295
This is for Goat Peter
and all the people of Switzerland

600
01:19:15.461 --> 01:19:17.420
you deprived of their freedom.

601
01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:20.628
Boo-hoo! My heart is bleeding.

602
01:19:21.128 --> 01:19:22.878
You're goddamn right it is.

603
01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:30.836
Death to the Fatherland!

604
01:19:31.003 --> 01:19:32.003
Fuck you!

605
01:19:52.461 --> 01:19:54.336
Long live the Motherland!

606
01:20:01.253 --> 01:20:02.253
Heidi!

607
01:20:02.586 --> 01:20:03.586
Grandfather!

608
01:20:05.628 --> 01:20:09.211
How could you lie to me about my parents?
- Heidi. I didn't...

609
01:20:11.545 --> 01:20:13.628
I thought you were dead.

610
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:19.211
I hate to interrupt the family reunion.
but we're not done here.

611
01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.128
Shit!

612
01:20:25.461 --> 01:20:26.670
Klara!

613
01:20:27.128 --> 01:20:28.420
He...

614
01:20:28.878 --> 01:20:31.420
He ran into the tunnel.

615
01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.420
He... Meili!

616
01:20:43.378 --> 01:20:44.920
Voilà!

617
01:20:45.086 --> 01:20:48.170
Monsieur Meili. you are a genius.

618
01:20:48.503 --> 01:20:51.420
What you have achieved here
is truly magnifique.

619
01:20:51.586 --> 01:20:53.170
<i>C'est mon pleasure.</i>

620
01:20:54.295 --> 01:20:56.086
Mr. President.

621
01:21:02.086 --> 01:21:05.003
Is there a problem. monsieur Meili?
- Oui.

622
01:21:05.336 --> 01:21:06.878
<i>Non! Non! Non!</i>

623
01:21:08.295 --> 01:21:11.628
Let us celebrate this historic moment.

624
01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.920
It is a tradition here in Switzerland

625
01:21:16.253 --> 01:21:19.086
to have a cheese dessert
after signing a contract.

626
01:21:19.836 --> 01:21:21.211
Schwitzgebel!

627
01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:26.253
I'm proud to present to you
the latest creation from our gourmet line.

628
01:21:27.711 --> 01:21:29.420
<i>Bon appetit. monsieurs!</i>

629
01:21:38.253 --> 01:21:39.753
<i>Formidable</i>!

630
01:21:49.961 --> 01:21:50.961
Holy cow!

631
01:21:51.461 --> 01:21:53.170
Those sick fucks!

632
01:21:53.711 --> 01:21:57.420
Impressive. isn't it?
I call them the mother cows.

633
01:21:58.045 --> 01:22:01.711
The secret to our new delicious
Ultra Swiss product line.

634
01:22:09.545 --> 01:22:11.878
Soon the world will be mine!

635
01:22:12.211 --> 01:22:13.795
Not if I can help it!

636
01:22:14.128 --> 01:22:15.795
Aww. so cute!

637
01:22:16.378 --> 01:22:19.795
But it doesn't matter
what you do now anyway.

638
01:22:20.045 --> 01:22:21.045
Attack!

639
01:22:24.086 --> 01:22:25.711
Bon voyage. bitch!

640
01:22:43.336 --> 01:22:45.628
Now that's what I call Swiss cheese!

641
01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.211
Where do you think you're going?

642
01:23:14.461 --> 01:23:15.836
Hit it. Ueli!

643
01:23:37.711 --> 01:23:40.253
Rest in cheese. bitch.

644
01:23:46.795 --> 01:23:48.295
Grandfather!

645
01:23:50.378 --> 01:23:53.503
Looks like the fuckers got me this time.

646
01:24:03.045 --> 01:24:05.628
Okay. people. let's rig this place.

647
01:24:10.878 --> 01:24:13.170
I'm sorry I lied to you. Heidi.

648
01:24:13.336 --> 01:24:18.253
I just tried to protect you.
I didn't want to lose you too.

649
01:24:20.461 --> 01:24:25.170
Just look how you've turned out.
I should never have doubted you.

650
01:24:25.336 --> 01:24:28.795
I don't care. Just don't die. you hear?

651
01:24:30.336 --> 01:24:32.503
It's alright. Heidi. It's alright.

652
01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:35.545
This old-timer's time is up.

653
01:24:36.336 --> 01:24:40.045
Oh. I'm turning into one of those things!

654
01:24:41.503 --> 01:24:44.295
Ueli! Come on. let me take care of that.

655
01:24:49.878 --> 01:24:51.253
My Heidi.

656
01:24:53.045 --> 01:24:55.961
I'm so proud of you.

657
01:24:56.128 --> 01:24:57.628
Now go!

658
01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:04.711
I think I'll just stick around here.
Just for a little while.

659
01:25:09.086 --> 01:25:10.961
Goodbye. Grandfather!

660
01:25:11.378 --> 01:25:15.295
Alright! Get all the women
and let's get the hell out of here!

661
01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.961
Goodbye. old friend.

662
01:25:42.295 --> 01:25:44.670
The only good cheese...

663
01:25:45.211 --> 01:25:48.128
is fried cheese.

664
01:26:39.378 --> 01:26:41.461
It was my wife's. you know?

665
01:26:43.086 --> 01:26:46.711
She gave it to Goat Peter
shortly before she passed away.

666
01:26:48.253 --> 01:26:50.211
I'm glad it's yours now.

667
01:26:52.128 --> 01:26:54.670
I will always keep it close to my heart.

668
01:26:55.795 --> 01:26:57.378
It looks good on you.

669
01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:02.920
I hope it always reminds you
of the days in the mountains

670
01:27:04.128 --> 01:27:07.670
and that it will preserve
that innocence within you.

671
01:27:11.503 --> 01:27:13.128
Let's go!

672
01:27:24.503 --> 01:27:25.628
You ready to do this?

673
01:27:26.128 --> 01:27:27.253
Fuck. yeah!

674
01:27:32.378 --> 01:27:36.086
<i>There is no snow in Yokohama</i>

675
01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:39.920
<i>There are no ski slopes on Hawaii</i>

676
01:27:40.086 --> 01:27:42.420
<i>In Barcelona. no such thing as ski</i>

677
01:27:42.753 --> 01:27:46.045
<i>Which is why we let it be
And don't leave home at all</i>

678
01:27:47.753 --> 01:27:50.670
<i>There is no slalom in Acapulco</i>

679
01:27:51.670 --> 01:27:55.045
<i>And no downhill in Corinth</i>

680
01:27:55.461 --> 01:27:59.253
<i>On the Bahamas it's too hot
That's why we travel not</i>

681
01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:02.170
<i>And just stay put where we are...</i>

682
01:28:03.253 --> 01:28:04.753
Fuck!

683
01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:10.670
<i>Our mountains. they are so lovely
So much to do and see...</i>

684
01:28:15.545 --> 01:28:18.420
<i>Heidi and Klara will return in...</i>

685
01:28:18.586 --> 01:28:20.586
<i>"Heidi & Klara"!</i>
