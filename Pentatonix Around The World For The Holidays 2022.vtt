Maybe we should dedicate it

362
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.100
Gosh. that--
That letter brought back so many memories.

363
00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.019
You guys remember
when you were at my wedding.

364
00:17:41.102 --> 00:17:43.355
We had sorrel. We had black cake.

365
00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:45.899
My mom wanted to represent
that Grenadian culture.

366
00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:49.319
And I remember… [chuckles]
…growing up. on Sunday mornings.

367
00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.654
my mom would make
this huge Grenadian breakfast

368
00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:56.034
with spiced hot chocolate.
with salt fish. with johnny bake.

369
00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:58.953
'Cause she really wanted her food
to bring us all together.

370
00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:02.165
So did you have a bunch of those
cook-outs like Sabrina did on the island

371
00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.458
when you were growing up? Or…

372
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.044
No. 'cause you literally need a full week
to prepare for those.

373
00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.421
-Yeah. and it's just mama in the kitchen.
-[Kevin] Yeah. exactly.

374
00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:11.549
And we didn't have any Caribbean people
around us in Kentucky.

375
00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:14.511
But my mom still keeps in touch
with a lot of people from Grenada.

376
00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.137
-Nice. That's awesome.
-[Mitch] Oh. cool.

377
00:18:16.221 --> 00:18:18.598
Wow. yeah. Sabrina and her grandparents…

378
00:18:18.682 --> 00:18:22.644
You know. it makes me think of
my great-grandmother and my grandmother.

379
00:18:22.727 --> 00:18:27.273
They would come over on Christmas Eve.
and they would cook dinner for us.

380
00:18:27.357 --> 00:18:30.568
And so they would make Christmas-Day
dinner all through the night.

381
00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:33.279
-and it would literally rock us to sleep.
-[Kevin. Scott] Aw.

382
00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:35.323
The smell and the aura
of the mac and cheese--

383
00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:37.033
-It was so good. All the things.
-[Kirstin] Yum.

384
00:18:37.117 --> 00:18:38.159
I'm coming over. That's crazy.

385
00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:40.203
Yeah. I know.
You need to have some for real.

386
00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:43.790
But those traditions are so important.
and. you know. for…

387
00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:45.291

Oh. I'm just not getting any signal still
at all. no bars.

393
00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:56.886
-Oh! [chuckles]
-Whoa.

394
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.555

395
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.432
There's something in there.

396
00:19:03.476 --> 00:19:05.729

And so. I just fell in love with it
and wanted to do it my whole life.

654
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.523
Yeah. same.

655
00:33:43.606 --> 00:33:45.942
I think I was. like. four or five.

656
00:33:46.026 --> 00:33:48.361
and. you guys know.
but my dad's a music pastor.

657
00:33:48.445 --> 00:33:49.696
and he plays piano and sings.

658
00:33:49.779 --> 00:33:52.157
So I remember. one day. we were at church.

659
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.325
and he was like.
"Let's sing like we do at home."

660
00:33:54.409 --> 00:33:56.911
And then I got a microphone.
and I started singing.

661
00:33:56.995 --> 00:33:59.497
and everybody just started going crazy.

662
00:33:59.581 --> 00:34:00.415

'cause what it makes you realize is
that we're not just making an album.

667

We're passing on our stories
and our traditions through music.

so important during Christmastime.

786
00:41:01.127 --> 00:41:04.839
that my family does that is
cooking and baking together.

787
00:41:04.923 --> 00:41:07.217

We were just talking about what we could--
how we could keep his spirit alive.

790
00:41:13.556 --> 00:41:16.976
and I think a lot of that is
through the stories that we tell…

791
00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.312
-Yeah.
-…and the traditions that we continue.

792

-[Scott] Yeah.

on Christmas to stick with family.

00:42:39.476 --> 00:42:40.935
especially during the holidays.

820
00:42:41.019 --> 00:42:43.772
And that's why we love
your holiday albums.

821
00:42:43.855 --> 00:42:46.441
Can't wait to hear more. Love. DCappella."

822
00:42:46.524 --> 00:42:47.567
-Cute.
-[Scott] Aw.

823
00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:48.651
They're right.

824
00:42:48.735 --> 00:42:51.029
I mean. look at all these letters
from all over the world.

825
00:42:51.112 --> 00:42:53.740
You know. we really get the chance
to bring people together.

826
00:42:53.823 --> 00:42:56.451
Yeah. it just shows that we all
have so much in common.

827
00:42:56.534 --> 00:42:57.994
no matter where we are in the world.

828
00:42:58.078 --> 00:43:00.080
I mean. look at us. [chuckles]

829
00:43:00.163 --> 00:43:03.249
We all come from different backgrounds
and different holiday traditions.

830
00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:05.794
but we can come together
and make perfect harmony.

831
00:43:05.877 --> 00:43:07.462
And that's the real magic.

832
00:43:07.545 --> 00:43:10.548
I have a feeling
that we're all thinking the same thing.

833
00:43:11.424 --> 00:43:13.593
-It's a small world.
-We've got to get out of this room.

834
00:43:15.762 --> 00:43:18.264
I mean. it's a small world.

00:43:21.518 --> 00:43:23.436

Cool? Okay! Yay!

[stammering] I'm just gonna
close up shop here. Close it up.

890
00:46:39.883 --> 00:46:41.968
And. uh. yeah. I'll be there in two secs.

891
00:46:43.094 --> 00:46:45.180
Sure. maybe I locked them in.

892
00:46:45.263 --> 00:46:47.432
But I also created the perfect scenario

893
00:46:47.515 --> 00:46:51.061
for one of the best bands in the world
to find their holiday magic.

894
00:46:51.144 --> 00:46:52.979
All it took was locking them in a room

895
00:46:53.063 --> 00:46:55.648
with millions of fan letters
and minimal oxygen.

896
00:46:56.524 --> 00:46:58.777
And having a great engineer helps too.

897
00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.032
And that is how you make
the greatest holiday album of all time.

898
00:47:06.242 --> 00:47:08.745
Excuse me. What are you still doing here?

899
00:47:09.287 --> 00:47:12.123
And are you doing an interview
with yourself?

[scoffs] No. I'm not. [clears throat]

901
00:47:14.751 --> 00:47:18.171
You're trying to take credit
for all of this. aren't you? Unbelievable.

-It's--
-You know what?

903

Let's just give him this.

904
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.387
If we didn't get locked in that room. we
wouldn't have been able to make the album.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.014
So. thanks.
