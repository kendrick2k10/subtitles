00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.166
Here you go.
Thank you.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.633
Oh. that was wonderful.

7
00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:24.533
What a beautiful day
for a ride.

8
00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.166
Our last ride.

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.900
At least we got to fit one in
before I go.

10
00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:31.166
But I don't want you to go.

11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.600
It's only for the summer.

12
00:00:32.734 --> 00:00:34.600
That's a long time. Mom.

13
00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.133
Erin...

14
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.834
...you know your dad

15
00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:40.867
doesn't want you
to call me that anymore.

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.367
I don't care what Dad says.

17
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.967
You're my Mom.
and you always will be.

18
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.600
But your dad and I
are divorced now and...

19
00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:48.000
he's seeing someone new.

20
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.133
Yeah. Bethany.

21
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.200
I hate her.

22
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.834
That's because
you don't know her.

23
00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:53.266
Which is why
your dad and I thought

24
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.667
that my summer vacation
was the perfect opportunity

25
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.600
for you and Bethany
to spend time together.

26
00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:02.133
without me around
as a distraction.

27
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.867
But why do you
have to go so far?

28
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.233
Because Parable
is a magical place.

29
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.400
I was your age
the last time I there.

30
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.233
But what if it's. like.
totally changed

31
00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:15.900
and it's really horrible now?

32
00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:17.934
Well. I guess I'll find out.

33
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.266
Can I come visit?

34
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.633
That's up to your father.

35
00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:26.166
But we'll stay in touch.

36
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.633
Okay? Constantly.

37
00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:33.266
I'm gonna miss you so much.

38
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.467
Me too. sweetheart.

39
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.600
Me too. Come here.

I wouldn't do that.

Do what?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.300
Well. leave your purse there

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:00.834
Well. I guess you would know.

58
00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:01.867
Thanks for the tip.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.100

You too.

61
00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:26.367
Hi!

62
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.767
Hi.

63
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:28.867
Ms. Kendall?

64
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.200
Tara. Please.

65
00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:31.934
Joanna Barlow.
Nice to meet you.

66
00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:33.300
Welcome to Parable.

67
00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:34.567
Thank you.

68
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.000
So. how are we doing in
the first-impression department?

69
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.100
So far. so good.

70
00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:42.900
Come on. let me
give you the grand tour.

71
00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:44.633
Can I help you with your bags?

72
00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:45.867
Oh. no. no. I'll get--
I'll get them later.

73
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.900
Okay.

74
00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:50.000
Watch your step here.

75
00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:56.467
Well. this is it.

76
00:03:58.033 --> 00:03:59.767
Dad's a stickler
for authentic--

77
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.767
read. "fusty and musty."

78
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.834
Mom wanted
to modernize the place.

79
00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:05.467
He grumbled a bit.

80
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.867
but secretly.
I know he likes it.

81
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.266
I bet.

82
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.800
They retired to Florida
a couple of years ago

83
00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:12.767
and transferred the title
to me and my husband.

84
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.233
but we have
a bigger working ranch.

85
00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:15.433
and we're happy there.

86
00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:17.800
We should probably
sell this place.

87
00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:19.934
but. you know.
sentimental value.

88
00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:22.467
Wow. What a beautiful view.

89
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.300
Mm. Is that what
brought you here? The view?

90
00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:27.533
Because if you Google
"off the beaten track."

91
00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:29.266
there's bound to be
a picture of Parable.

92
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.834
I came here for a few weeks
as a girl.

93
00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:33.333
Summer camp
at the dude ranch.

94
00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:34.300
Whisper Creek?

95
00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:35.700
Yeah! Yeah.
I looked it up online.

96
00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:37.166
I know
it's no longer in operation.

97
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.500
No. not anymore.

98
00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:39.633
That's too bad.

99
00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:42.300
Some of the happiest days
of my life.

100
00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:44.400
And I could really use
some happy right now.

101
00:04:44.533 --> 00:04:46.133
You know. bad divorce.

102
00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:47.600
- Ah.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:49.000
- I got it.
-

104
00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:51.000
What is that sound?

105
00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:52.734
Oh. let me show you.

106
00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:54.333
Bawk!

107
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.000
They're overflow
from the ranch.

108
00:04:58.133 --> 00:04:59.300
We've been roosting them here.

109
00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:01.700
I'll come by tomorrow
to collect them.

110
00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.200
How fun.

111
00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:05.066
Chickens? Fun?

112
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.333
Yeah! Leave 'em here!
I'll take care of them.

113
00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:09.667
Uh. chickens are a lot of work.

114
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.834
I'm not afraid of work.

115
00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:13.700
Okay. if you want.

116
00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:16.233
I'll have my son. Dawson.
come by to get you up to speed.

117
00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:17.333
He's an expert.

118
00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:19.567
Okay. Great.

119
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.300
All right.
Good to see ya.

120
00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:25.166
Hey. Don't tell me
you brought me lunch.

121
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.967
I won't.
'cause I didn't.

122
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.333
To what do I owe the pleasure?

123
00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:31.100
I just thought
I'd stop by and say hi.

124
00:05:31.233 --> 00:05:33.633
Uh-huh.

125
00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:36.266
Okay. You got me.

126
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.066
It was all Kendra's idea.

127
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.867
That sounds like it. Yep.

128
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.500
You remember her cousin. Julie.
from Billings?

129
00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:45.800
Yeah. Sure.
Got married last summer. right?

130
00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:50.200
Uh. she called that off. actually.

131
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.166
Oh. Well...

132
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.066
I'm sorry to hear that.

133
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.133
Anyway. she's gonna be
visiting this weekend.

134
00:05:56.266 --> 00:05:59.033
I thought you might want
to come over for a barbecue.

135
00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:00.767
You're not trying
to set me up. are ya?

136
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.800
Absolutely.

137
00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:03.734
I really wish
you wouldn't do that.

138
00:06:03.867 --> 00:06:06.233
You told me you were ready
to start dating again.

139
00:06:06.367 --> 00:06:07.500
No. that's not what I said.

140
00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:10.367
I said I'm ready to start thinking
about dating again.

141
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.734
There's a big difference!

142
00:06:11.867 --> 00:06:12.767
Julie's a fun girl.

143
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.100
Yeah. I'm sure
she's a fun girl.

144
00:06:14.233 --> 00:06:15.300
She's also young.

145
00:06:15.433 --> 00:06:17.000
She's never been a mom.

146
00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:18.233
I got the boys.

147
00:06:18.367 --> 00:06:21.133
And the evidence would suggest
that she's marriage-shy.

148
00:06:21.266 --> 00:06:23.567
Boone. I'm not talking
about marriage.

149
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.033
I'm talking about a barbecue.

150
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.600
Look. Hutch.

151
00:06:27.734 --> 00:06:29.800
I appreciate it.
I really do.

152
00:06:29.934 --> 00:06:30.900
but if I'm gonna
walk through that door.

153
00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:32.233
it's gotta feel right
going in.

154
00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:33.667
That's all there is to it.

155
00:06:34.934 --> 00:06:38.867
What you had with Corrie
was really special.

156
00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.900
You make a lousy good ol' boy.
you know that?

157
00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:44.233
Look who's talking!

158
00:06:44.367 --> 00:06:45.734
Ah...

159
00:06:45.867 --> 00:06:46.800
love ya anyway.

160
00:06:46.934 --> 00:06:48.400

Squeezing the gloves. right?

173
00:07:52.633 --> 00:07:54.700
So what'd you guys
get up to at day camp today?

174
00:07:54.834 --> 00:07:55.900
Played baseball.

175
00:07:56.033 --> 00:07:57.367
With girls. Boring.

176
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.133
Girls? What have you got
against girls?

177
00:07:59.266 --> 00:08:00.734
There's only like
a dozen campers. Fletcher.

178
00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:02.000
If they don't team us up
with the girls.

179
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.467
we can't play baseball
or anything.

180
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.734
We don't need to play baseball.

181
00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:05.867
What?

182
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.100
Who are you and what
have you done with my son?

183
00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:09.400
My kid loves baseball.

184
00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:10.900
Nicole tagged him out
at home today.

185
00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:11.967
Ahh.

186
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.033
I was safe!

187
00:08:13.166 --> 00:08:14.700
Her mitt never touched me.

188
00:08:14.834 --> 00:08:17.533
And if it had.
it would've been icky!

189
00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:20.233
"Icky"? Let me
tell you something. young man.

190
00:08:20.367 --> 00:08:21.400
One of these days.

191
00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:23.400
you are going to like girls.

192
00:08:23.533 --> 00:08:24.734
No. I won't.

193
00:08:24.867 --> 00:08:26.367
- Mom was a girl. you know.
- Uh-huh.

194
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.166
No. she wasn't.
She was... a mom.

195
00:08:30.734 --> 00:08:31.967
Mm.

196
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.266
You know what I miss about Mom?

197
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.333
- What's that. bud?
- Her spaghetti sauce.

198
00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:37.767
What?

199
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.967
Are you saying
you don't like my sauce?

200
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.533
Mom's was better.

201
00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:43.000
It's the same recipe!

202
00:08:43.133 --> 00:08:44.033
It doesn't taste the same.

203
00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:46.734
Well. how's it supposed
to taste?

204
00:08:46.867 --> 00:08:48.834
I don't know.
more like Mom's.

205
00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:50.200
May I be excused?

206
00:08:52.133 --> 00:08:54.500
Yeah. Yeah. sure. Fletch.
Go ahead.

207
00:09:01.867 --> 00:09:04.033
Any idea what's eating
your little brother?

208
00:09:05.066 --> 00:09:06.400
Oh. you know.

209
00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:07.500
Right.

210
00:09:08.567 --> 00:09:10.900
He doesn't like it
when we talk about Mom.

211
00:09:13.467 --> 00:09:16.000
I mean. it's sad
that she's gone and all.

212
00:09:16.133 --> 00:09:17.567
but. like...

213
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.400
we should be able
to talk about her still.

214
00:09:19.533 --> 00:09:21.300
Yeah. I agree. Absolutely.

215
00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:23.934
We should be able
to talk about her.

216
00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:25.767
But here's the thing. Griff.

217
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.967
Ahem. You're the older brother.

218
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.300
Fletch is always gonna be
playing catch-up.

219
00:09:30.433 --> 00:09:33.467
so I think we just have to...

220
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.000
we have to be patient with him.
that's all.

221
00:09:36.133 --> 00:09:37.633
Okay. I will.

222
00:09:37.767 --> 00:09:38.767
I'm gonna go check
on your brother.

223
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.266
You finish up and then
clear the table. okay?

224
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.333
- Okay.
- Thattaboy.

225
00:09:43.467 --> 00:09:44.734
Oh. yeah. and this time--

226
00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:45.700
when you do the dishes.

227
00:09:45.834 --> 00:09:48.900
put the dishes
in the dishwasher.

228
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.166
...Spinach. cabbage.
uh. ground-up eggshells.

229
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.166
Eggshells?

230
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.333
Isn't that
a little cannibalistic?

231
00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:07.633
Not for the chickens.
I guess.

232
00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:09.166
Uh. we'll be mixing up
a special batch for them

233
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.166
later in the week--

234
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.600
I could bring you some.

235
00:10:11.734 --> 00:10:14.300
Yeah. that would be great. thanks.

236
00:10:14.433 --> 00:10:18.967
So. um. are we raising them
to be eaten?

237
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.266
We usually just keep 'em
for the eggs.

238
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.133
Oh. okay.
well. I will too. then.

239
00:10:23.266 --> 00:10:24.367
They're gonna lay a lot of 'em.

240
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.000
The local supply store will
buy the extras off of you.

241
00:10:27.133 --> 00:10:28.100
While you're there.

242
00:10:28.233 --> 00:10:29.934
I'd get yourself
a good pair of gloves.

243
00:10:30.066 --> 00:10:31.667
'cause. this breed...

244
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.667
they like to bite.

245
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.900
Oh. Good to know.

246
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.500
You look like
you could use some help.

247
00:10:58.734 --> 00:10:59.934
Thanks. I-I could.

248
00:11:00.066 --> 00:11:03.033
Um. I am looking
for a pair of work gloves.

249
00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:05.834
and I don't know
what kind to--

250
00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.500
I'm sorry. Are you--
Are you Casey Elfman?

251
00:11:09.633 --> 00:11:11.500
My clever disguise
fails again.

252
00:11:11.633 --> 00:11:15.066
I'm sure you hear this a lot.
but I am a huge fan.

253
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.900
Well. I can
never hear it enough.

254
00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:19.200
Now. what are you gonna be
doing in these work gloves?

255
00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:21.367
Warding off chicken bites.

256
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.200
Ah!

257
00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:24.667
Follow me.

258
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.166
- Hey. Leonard.
- Hey!

259
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.834
You got a new customer here.

260
00:11:27.967 --> 00:11:29.066
Snag her a pair

261
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.166
of those heavy duty.
lifetime-guarantee work gloves.

262
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.266
You got it.

263
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.967
So you live here?

264
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.767
When I'm not on the road.
Parable's my safe-haven.

265
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.567
Yeah. That "safe-haven" being
a thousand-acre ranch.

266
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.900
She even has
a private runway for her jet.

267
00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:44.500
So I can get here quicker
and stay longer.

268
00:11:44.633 --> 00:11:46.266
And we wouldn't want it
any other way.

269
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.467
She's done us proud.

270
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.367
Aw.

271
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.266
I'm Tara. Tara Kendall.
by the way.

272
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.533
I'm spending the summer here.

273
00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:53.000
Well. it's nice
to meet you. Tara.

274
00:11:53.133 --> 00:11:54.834
- Yeah. welcome to Parable.
- Thanks.

275
00:11:54.967 --> 00:11:56.867
Now. you take good care of her
now. Leonard. d'you hear?

276
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.900
I'll do my darnedest.

277
00:11:58.033 --> 00:11:58.934
'Kay. See you later.

278
00:11:59.066 --> 00:12:00.033
Bye.

279
00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:01.300
Wow!

280
00:12:01.433 --> 00:12:02.633
It's pretty cool. right?

281
00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:04.633
So cool!

282
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.300
-
- Okay. okay!

283
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:32.066
Okay. you guys.
Sorry I'm late.

284
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.834
There you go.
There you go.

285
00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:36.767
Ow!

286
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.166
No! No-no-no-no!
No-no-no-no!

287
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.200
No. no.

288
00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:40.700
Get back here!

289
00:12:42.533 --> 00:12:43.500
Oh. no-no-no-no-no!

290
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.567
Come on.
Get back here.

291
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.967
Come on.
let's go see your friends.

292
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:48.967
Come on.

293
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.800
No. no.

294
00:12:49.934 --> 00:12:51.100
No. No. No. no. no.

295
00:12:51.233 --> 00:12:52.433
Go this way. Go this way.
Come on.

296
00:12:52.567 --> 00:12:54.166
Whoa! Almost. All right.

297
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.500
No. no. no. no. no.
no. no. no. Come on.

298
00:12:56.633 --> 00:12:58.100
Not underneath the truck!

299
00:12:58.233 --> 00:12:59.934
Oh!

300
00:13:00.066 --> 00:13:03.500
Okay. All right.
Come on.

301
00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:04.867
You can do it!

302
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.033
Tch-tch-tch-tch.

303
00:13:06.166 --> 00:13:08.200
She looks pretty comfortable
under there. huh?

304
00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:09.633
Oh!

305
00:13:09.767 --> 00:13:11.000
I'm-- I'm sorry. I--

306
00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:12.600
No problem. No worries.

307
00:13:12.734 --> 00:13:13.700
She can't go anywhere.

308
00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:16.934
So. you. uh. you must be
renting Joanna's place?

309
00:13:17.066 --> 00:13:18.767
Yes. For the summer.

310
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.900
Do you know the Barlows?

311
00:13:20.033 --> 00:13:21.467
Oh. yeah. yeah.
you could say that.

312
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.166
This is Parable. ma'am.
Everybody knows everybody.

313
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.834
Well. then it's not "ma'am."
it's Tara.

314
00:13:25.967 --> 00:13:26.967
Tara Kendall.

315
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.800
Tara. Nice to meet you.
I'm Boone Taylor.

316
00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:30.100
This is my place.

317
00:13:31.934 --> 00:13:34.467
Now. why do I feel like
I know you from somewhere?

318
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.934
The gas station.
the other day.

319
00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:38.100
Yes. I remember--

320
00:13:38.233 --> 00:13:40.033
uh. red convertible.
New York plates?

321
00:13:40.166 --> 00:13:41.433
You will be pleased to know

322
00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:44.333
that I escaped
with my purse unsnatched.

323
00:13:44.467 --> 00:13:46.834
Oh. I am pleased. yeah.

324
00:13:46.967 --> 00:13:48.033
Because if it had been snatched.

325
00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:49.367
it'd make
a lot of extra work for me.

326
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.333
I'd have to hunt the guy down.
bring him to justice...

327
00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:54.767
and just imagine
all the paperwork.

328
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:56.266
Oh. you don't like your job?

329
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.700
I like fishing better.

330
00:13:57.834 --> 00:13:58.800
Mm.

331
00:13:58.934 --> 00:14:01.166
Ooh!

332
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.333
What happened to your hand?

333
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.166
Oh. uh. chicken bit me.

334
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.266
Yeah. you need gloves
with that breed.

335
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.600
Yeah. I forgot to put them on.

336
00:14:07.734 --> 00:14:10.433
Still getting the hang
of poultry management.

337
00:14:10.567 --> 00:14:11.533
Why don't you just get
the Barlows

338
00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:12.900
to take the chickens
off your hands?

339
00:14:13.033 --> 00:14:15.033
I am in the country
for the summer.

340
00:14:15.166 --> 00:14:17.033
and I'm gonna do
country things.

341
00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:18.467
Okay. well. let's. uh.

342
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.533
let's see if we can
get this chicken.

343
00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:22.533
Come here.

344
00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:23.533
Where'd you go?

345
00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:25.433
There we go!

346
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.066
Now. you think you can
get this bad boy home safe?

347
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.533
I will give it
the old college try.

348
00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:32.734
All right.
the important part here

349
00:14:32.867 --> 00:14:34.533
is to try
and hold it tight enough

350
00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:35.533
so it can't fly away.

351
00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.533
but not so tight
that you smother it.

352
00:14:37.667 --> 00:14:39.600
There you go! Perfect.

353
00:14:39.734 --> 00:14:43.367
Hey. Well. thank you
for saving the day.

354
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.834
It's fine. Of course.

355
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.834
Oh. uh. you should
give me your e-mail.

356
00:14:48.967 --> 00:14:50.600
My e-mail?

357
00:14:50.734 --> 00:14:52.100
Yeah. then I'll give you mine
and my cell phone number.

358
00:14:52.233 --> 00:14:54.066
I think folks around here
ought to have a way

359
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.100
to get ahold of one another.

360
00:14:55.233 --> 00:14:56.333
Of course.

361
00:14:56.467 --> 00:15:00.633
Uh. mine is
tkendall@nyftu.org.

362
00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:03.033
"NYFTU..."
I don't know that one.

363
00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:05.333
Uh. "New York
Federated Teachers' Union."

364
00:15:05.467 --> 00:15:07.166
So you're a teacher!

365
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.834
Oh. that's would explain
the summer rental.

366
00:15:09.967 --> 00:15:11.834
Well. excellent detective work. Sheriff.

367
00:15:11.967 --> 00:15:13.166
Oh. I've been known
to summon the chops

368
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.333
from time to time.

369
00:15:14.467 --> 00:15:16.133
As long as it doesn't interfere
with your fishing?

370
00:15:16.266 --> 00:15:17.633
All right. well.
we'll be on our way.

371
00:15:17.767 --> 00:15:18.934
- Okay.
- Thanks again.

372
00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:19.800
Bye.

373
00:15:19.934 --> 00:15:20.834
Good luck!

374
00:15:21.967 --> 00:15:24.000
Hi. buddy.

375
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.166
Joanna!

376
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.266
- Hey. you.
- Hey.

377
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.433
How's everything going?

378
00:15:30.567 --> 00:15:33.066
Well. I figured out
how the gas works.

379
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.266
I've stopped looking for
the New York Times

380
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.934
on the front porch
every morning.

381
00:15:37.066 --> 00:15:38.834
a chicken hasn't
bitten me in days--

382
00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:41.433
although. I have been tempted
to bite a few of them.

383
00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:43.333
Well. if anything comes up
that needs tending.

384
00:15:43.467 --> 00:15:44.333
you let me know.

385
00:15:44.467 --> 00:15:45.600
I love to ride and--

386
00:15:45.734 --> 00:15:48.767
are there stables in the area
that I could rent a horse?

387
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:50.166
Uh. not that I know of.

388
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.934
but you're more than welcome
to come to the ranch

389
00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:53.066
and ride one of ours.

390
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.400
Oh. I wouldn't
want to impose.

391
00:15:54.533 --> 00:15:56.400
Please. it would not be
an imposition at all.

392
00:15:56.533 --> 00:15:58.967
Although. you know.
Boone Taylor has horses.

393
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.400
and he lives
right next door to you.

394
00:16:00.533 --> 00:16:02.934
Oh. yeah.
I've seen his horses.

395
00:16:04.033 --> 00:16:05.000
Do you think he'd rent me one?

396
00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:07.033
Not in a million years!

397
00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:09.333
But he'd let you ride one.

398
00:16:09.467 --> 00:16:11.700
You should get to know him.
He's a nice guy.

399
00:16:11.834 --> 00:16:13.233
Oh. we've met.

400
00:16:13.367 --> 00:16:16.266
Um. but let me
ask you something.

401
00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:19.900
I've seen two boys...

402
00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:21.967
Oh. Yeah.
Griffin and Fletcher.

403
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.633
But no mom.
Is he divorced?

404
00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:26.467
He's widowed.
Three years now.

405
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.567
Oh. that's awful.

406
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.200
Yeah. Corrie
was pretty wonderful.

407
00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:30.700
We all loved her.

408
00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:31.700
Well. I should go.

409
00:16:31.834 --> 00:16:32.734
It was really good
to see you. Tara.

410
00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:33.867
You. too.

411
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.900
Hey!

412
00:16:35.033 --> 00:16:37.500
If you're not doing anything
Friday night.

413
00:16:37.633 --> 00:16:40.066
I recommend you get yourself
to the Parable Saloon.

414
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.333
How come?

415
00:16:41.467 --> 00:16:45.100
Casey Elfman is working on
material for her next album.

416
00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:47.500
Wow. uh...
yeah. I'm not missing that.

417
00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:49.200
Good!
Okay. we'll see you there.

418
00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:50.633
- Thanks! Bye.
- Bye.

419
00:16:54.367 --> 00:16:55.500
Erin! Hi.

420
00:16:55.633 --> 00:16:56.734
Hi. Tara.

421
00:16:56.867 --> 00:16:58.033
See? I'm trying.

422
00:16:58.166 --> 00:17:00.300
What's up?

423
00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:03.433
Uh. I just came in from a ride
and I was thinking about you.

424
00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:04.600
How are you?

425
00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:05.600
Not great.

426
00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:06.867
What's going on?

427
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.400
Dad wants to send me to camp.

428
00:17:08.533 --> 00:17:09.467
Oh. that could be fun.

429
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.367
It's in Maine.
For six weeks.

430
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.867
Oh.

431
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.433
The whole point
of you going away

432
00:17:16.567 --> 00:17:19.100
is for me to spend time
with Dad and Bethany.

433
00:17:19.233 --> 00:17:21.033
but now they want
to get rid of me.

434
00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:22.900
I'm sure that's not true.

435
00:17:23.033 --> 00:17:25.100
Yes. it is.

436
00:17:25.233 --> 00:17:26.533
Can you please talk to him?

437
00:17:26.667 --> 00:17:27.900
Erin...

438
00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:29.467
Please?

439
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.734
No. I can't.

440
00:17:31.867 --> 00:17:34.533
You guys have to work
these things out on your own.

441
00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:36.433
I'll be miserable
in Maine.

442
00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:38.667
Then tell your dad
that you don't want to.

443
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.900
If Bethany becomes my new mom.
I'm going to die.

444
00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:43.266
No. you won't.
You'll be fine.

445
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.500
I promise you.

446
00:17:44.633 --> 00:17:46.700
I just miss you so much.

447
00:17:46.834 --> 00:17:48.333
I miss you. too.

448
00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.934
I should probably go.

449
00:17:51.066 --> 00:17:52.667
The new nanny's probably coming
to pick me up.

450
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.133
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

451
00:17:54.266 --> 00:17:55.333
Okay. Bye.

452
00:17:55.467 --> 00:17:57.200
Bye-bye. sweetheart.

453
00:18:36.667 --> 00:18:37.967
Hello?

454
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.200
Boone? It's Tara.

455
00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:42.867
There's someone in my house.

456
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.767
Okay. well. go outside.
I'll be right there.

457
00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:55.200
You all right?

458
00:18:55.333 --> 00:18:56.800
Yeah. I am. He's inside.

459
00:18:56.934 --> 00:18:57.700
You saw him?

460
00:18:57.834 --> 00:18:58.867
No. I could hear him.

461
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.166
I think he's in the kitchen.

462
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.633
Okay. you stay right here.

463
00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:02.967
Okay. Be careful!

464
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.433
Yes.

465
00:19:18.233 --> 00:19:19.133
It's Hiram.

466
00:19:19.266 --> 00:19:20.934
Who's Hiram?

467
00:19:21.066 --> 00:19:22.633
I'm goin' in.

468
00:19:22.767 --> 00:19:24.734
- Be careful!
- Shh! Quiet.

469
00:19:41.867 --> 00:19:43.600
Well. that should do it.

470
00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:44.967
Shooed him out the back door.

471
00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.467
What? You didn't arrest him?

472
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.066
I was going to. but...

473
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.767
he's a raccoon.
so it'd be weird--

474
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.033
tiny handcuffs.

475
00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:55.367
Oh. come on!

476
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.734
Should we go take a look?

477
00:19:56.867 --> 00:19:58.300
Yes.

478
00:19:58.433 --> 00:20:00.800
I thought it was funny.
Come on!

479
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.433
Well. at least
he hasn't learned

480
00:20:07.567 --> 00:20:09.600
how to open
the refrigerator yet.

481
00:20:09.734 --> 00:20:10.767
He does this a lot?

482
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.967
Whenever opportunity
presents itself.

483
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.633
The. uh. the latch on the window
that he came through

484
00:20:16.767 --> 00:20:17.934
must be broken.

485
00:20:18.066 --> 00:20:21.433
I can't believe
I was so scared of a raccoon.

486
00:20:21.567 --> 00:20:23.467
Oh. I wouldn't be embarrassed
about that.

487
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.867
I'll bet you
that if I was in New York

488
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.500
and heard a bunch of
weird noises like that.

489
00:20:26.633 --> 00:20:27.767
I'd be just as rattled.

490
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.367
Back there. in New York.

491
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.233
I am universally acknowledged
for my savvy and competence.

492
00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:36.467
Here... not so much.

493
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.033
Ah. you'll get the hang of it.

494
00:20:38.166 --> 00:20:39.467
Thank you for saving the day.

495
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.100
Again.

496
00:20:42.233 --> 00:20:44.767
Apparently. your new job
is to run interference

497
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.900
with me
and Parable's animal kingdom.

498
00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:50.100
Don't worry about it.
it's my pleasure.

499
00:20:50.233 --> 00:20:52.900
Ah. what do you say we start
cleaning up this mess?

500
00:20:53.033 --> 00:20:53.900
Oh. no. no. no. no.

501
00:20:54.033 --> 00:20:55.433
You should get back
to your boys.

502
00:20:55.567 --> 00:20:57.800
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah. I got this.

503
00:20:57.934 --> 00:20:59.233
Let me walk you out.

504
00:20:59.367 --> 00:21:02.800
I won't argue with you.
All right.

505
00:21:08.633 --> 00:21:11.266
- Hey!
- Dad. where were you?

506
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.867
There was
an emergency next door.

507
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.667
What're you guys doing up?

508
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.166
Fletcher had
one of his nightmares.

509
00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.033
Oh. buddy.

510
00:21:19.166 --> 00:21:20.166
Come here.

511
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.800
Ohh...

512
00:21:21.934 --> 00:21:23.633
it's like picking up
a baby rhino now.

513
00:21:23.767 --> 00:21:25.533
You're getting so big.

514
00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:27.800
I made him warm milk
like you do. Dad.

515
00:21:27.934 --> 00:21:31.200
Oh. Best brother
in the world. hmm?

516
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.300
Listen. Fletch.

517
00:21:34.433 --> 00:21:35.834
Everybody has nightmares.

518
00:21:35.967 --> 00:21:37.000
Do you?

519
00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:38.867
Yes! Of course I do.

520
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.100
Yeah. It's just...
just part of life. you know?

521
00:21:43.233 --> 00:21:44.533
But here's the thing

522
00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:46.633
that you have to remember
about nightmares.

523
00:21:46.767 --> 00:21:48.467
and this is
really important. okay?

524
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.767
You always wake up.

525
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.200
And when you do.
everything's gonna be okay.

526
00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:58.467
And your brother and I
will always be there

527
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.567
to make sure
that everything is okay.

528
00:22:03.667 --> 00:22:04.500
Yeah?

529
00:22:04.633 --> 00:22:06.100
- Yeah.
- You got it?

530
00:22:06.233 --> 00:22:07.734
Now. it's late.

531
00:22:07.867 --> 00:22:09.900
You guys got to
get to bed. okay?

532
00:22:10.033 --> 00:22:12.266
Off you go! Boom.

533
00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:14.533
Goodnight!

534
00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:16.500
Goodnight.

535
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.233
Found this on the bookshelf.
I bet it was your grandfather's.

536
00:22:49.367 --> 00:22:51.066
You should give it a try.

537
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.433
I don't think
that's on my reading list.

538
00:22:53.567 --> 00:22:55.467
I'm sure it's not!

539
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.200
Kind of looks like Montana.

540
00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:00.100
It's a Western.
It's a whole genre--

541
00:23:00.233 --> 00:23:01.233
cowboys. shoot-'em-ups--

542
00:23:01.367 --> 00:23:02.467
they can be a lot of fun.

543
00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.433
More eggs?

544
00:23:03.567 --> 00:23:05.900
Oh. yes. please.
Thank you.

545
00:23:11.767 --> 00:23:13.567
Thanks again for the book.
I'll return it when I'm done.

546
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.734
Oh. no rush.

547
00:23:14.867 --> 00:23:16.800
And your grandfather
has a whole collection of those.

548
00:23:16.934 --> 00:23:17.834
if you want to read more.

549
00:23:17.967 --> 00:23:18.967
Oh. cool!

550
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.100
Hey. guys!

551
00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:21.166
Hey. Dawson.

552
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.333
Hey. Dawson.
How you doin'. bud?

553
00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:23.467
I'm good.
How are you guys?

554
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.567
- Good.
- Good to see you.

555
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.667
Good morning. Boone.

556
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.800
Good morning. Tara.

557
00:23:26.934 --> 00:23:28.467
Uh. I would like
to introduce you

558
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.567
to Fletcher and Griffin.

559
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.100
- Boys. this is Tara.
- Ma'am.

560
00:23:31.233 --> 00:23:32.166
Pleasure to meet you. boys.

561
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.900
Uh. a little something came up
this morning.

562
00:23:34.033 --> 00:23:36.367
and I was hoping that maybe
I could ask a favor.

563
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.400
Of course.

564
00:23:37.533 --> 00:23:39.300
I have a court appearance
in Missoula today.

565
00:23:39.433 --> 00:23:40.600
Did the lawman break the law?

566
00:23:40.734 --> 00:23:43.633
No. But a fella
who had one too many

567
00:23:43.767 --> 00:23:44.734
and took his truck
for a spin did.

568
00:23:44.867 --> 00:23:46.133
How can I help?

569
00:23:46.266 --> 00:23:48.300
Well. they up and canceled
day camp today.

570
00:23:48.433 --> 00:23:49.600
and I really didn't want

571
00:23:49.734 --> 00:23:51.000
to leave the boys at home
by themselves.

572
00:23:51.133 --> 00:23:52.900
- We'll be fine. Dad!
- Zip it.

573
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.667
I would be delighted
to have some company.

574
00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.600
I've made a fresh pitcher
of lemonade.

575
00:23:59.734 --> 00:24:01.600
I don't like lemonade.
It's too sweet.

576
00:24:01.734 --> 00:24:04.767
Well. you'll like mine. then.
because it's just sweet enough.

577
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.000
Well. there you go.

578
00:24:06.133 --> 00:24:07.934
All right. you two.
You behave.

579
00:24:08.066 --> 00:24:08.967
Thank you.

580
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:10.300
Good luck!

581
00:24:10.433 --> 00:24:11.467
Come on. boys.

582
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.967
All right.
What do you want to do?

583
00:24:20.033 --> 00:24:21.900
I'm glad you like it.

584
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.400
Not too sweet?

585
00:24:24.533 --> 00:24:25.834
No. It's good.

586
00:24:25.967 --> 00:24:27.734
Do you have any threes?

587
00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:29.900
Ah. let's see.

588
00:24:31.567 --> 00:24:32.700
Yes.

589
00:24:36.834 --> 00:24:37.934
I win.

590
00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:39.467
Again?

591
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.567
Now I know
why you taught me this game.

592
00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.367
Our mom taught it to us.

593
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.200
I wish I had the chance
to play it with her.

594
00:24:50.333 --> 00:24:53.266
She would've beat you.
Every time.

595
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.133
I'm sure she would have.

596
00:24:57.467 --> 00:24:58.834
You must miss her.

597
00:24:58.967 --> 00:25:01.066
I do. All the time.

598
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.467
But "she loved us very much.

599
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.900
and she wouldn't have left us
for anything in the world.

600
00:25:06.033 --> 00:25:07.200
if she could've helped it."

601
00:25:07.333 --> 00:25:08.467
My dad told us that.

602
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.066
I'm sure she wouldn't have.

603
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.834
We're doing just fine.

604
00:25:12.967 --> 00:25:15.033
Not every family has a mom.
you know.

605
00:25:15.166 --> 00:25:16.500
We're not that unusual.

606
00:25:16.633 --> 00:25:18.066
That's true.

607
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.600
I still miss her.

608
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.333
Of course. you do.

609
00:25:22.467 --> 00:25:23.500
Another game?

610
00:25:23.633 --> 00:25:26.066
Sure. but I am still
not playing for money.

611
00:25:29.433 --> 00:25:30.500
-
- Hey. Dad.

612
00:25:30.633 --> 00:25:31.500
Hey. boys.

613
00:25:31.633 --> 00:25:33.533
House is still standing.
That's a good sign.

614
00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:34.533
Race ya.

615
00:25:34.667 --> 00:25:37.066
Whoa. whoa. whoa! Boys!

616
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:38.066
What do you say?

617
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.467
- Thank you. ma'am!
- Thanks. Tara.

618
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.500
-
- Anytime!

619
00:25:41.633 --> 00:25:42.967
They're good boys.

620
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.166
Yeah. I think so.

621
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.500
They act like tough guys.

622
00:25:46.633 --> 00:25:48.567
but they're really
a couple of softies at heart.

623
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.867
I guess they take after
their mother.

624
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.333
So. was justice served
in Missoula?

625
00:25:53.467 --> 00:25:54.800
Gotta wait for
the jury to weigh in.

626
00:25:54.934 --> 00:25:56.633
but I did my part.

627
00:25:56.767 --> 00:25:58.867
But now...

628
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.867
I'm gonna fix
that broken window latch.

629
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.934
You don't have to do that.

630
00:26:03.066 --> 00:26:04.033
Oh. I know I don't.

631
00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:06.433
but can't Hiram or his friends
waking you up--

632
00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:07.667
I need my sleep.

633
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.934
Don't worry.
it'll just take a minute.

634
00:26:09.066 --> 00:26:12.066
But I'm thinking that maybe...

635
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.100
yeah.

636
00:26:13.233 --> 00:26:14.934
Yeah. it's gonna cost you.

637
00:26:15.066 --> 00:26:16.133
Oh?

638
00:26:16.266 --> 00:26:17.867
Yeah. I wanna see how unsweet
that lemonade really is.

639
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.233
- Oh. really?
- Yeah.

640
00:26:19.367 --> 00:26:20.667
Yeah? All right.

641
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.800
Well. um. right this way.

642
00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:26.300
Great. So. really. the kids--
the kids were behaved?

643
00:26:32.166 --> 00:26:35.500
Now. that
is what I'm talkin' about.

644
00:26:35.633 --> 00:26:37.300
Too much sugar's
a deal-breaker.

645
00:26:37.433 --> 00:26:38.934
Amen to that!

646
00:26:39.066 --> 00:26:41.300
Ooh. that's good.

647
00:26:43.734 --> 00:26:45.934
Joanna told me
about your wife.

648
00:26:46.066 --> 00:26:49.100
and the boys and I talked
about it a bit today.

649
00:26:50.233 --> 00:26:51.533
I'm so sorry.

650
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.767
Thank you.

651
00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.533
That must have been hard.

652
00:26:59.867 --> 00:27:01.400
Yeah.

653
00:27:01.533 --> 00:27:03.433
Yeah. it was.

654
00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:09.367
But. you know.
it's been a while and. um...

655
00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:12.633
...well. things are starting
to get a little bit better.

656
00:27:12.767 --> 00:27:13.834
Anyway. how about you?

657
00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:15.767
You. uh. you ever been married?

658
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.133
Yeah.

659
00:27:17.266 --> 00:27:18.967
Uh. divorced now.

660
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:19.800
Ah.

661
00:27:19.934 --> 00:27:21.033
It got pretty ugly.

662
00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:22.400
Now that sounds hard.

663
00:27:22.533 --> 00:27:24.667
It's pretty complicated with...

664
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.200
with me and James.

665
00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:27.600
That's my ex.

666
00:27:27.734 --> 00:27:30.100
We share a daughter together.
it--

667
00:27:30.233 --> 00:27:31.600
his daughter. technically.

668
00:27:31.734 --> 00:27:32.967
from--
from a previous marriage.

669
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.800
but she was so little
when her mom died.

670
00:27:35.934 --> 00:27:38.800
she doesn't...
she doesn't remember.

671
00:27:38.934 --> 00:27:41.266
I'm the only mother
she's ever known.

672
00:27:42.667 --> 00:27:44.133
It's gonna be hard
to be that mom.

673
00:27:44.266 --> 00:27:45.266
now that you're divorced.

674
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.834
Yeah.

675
00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:51.033
That's what hurts the most.

676
00:27:52.133 --> 00:27:54.467
I have a question. Boone.

677
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.133
Hmm?

678
00:27:56.266 --> 00:27:58.700
Those beautiful horses
of yours...

679
00:27:58.834 --> 00:28:02.400
I love to ride.
and. um. well.

680
00:28:02.533 --> 00:28:04.567
I was wondering if. um.

681
00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:09.000
if you would consider renting me
one from time to time?

682
00:28:09.133 --> 00:28:12.433
No. no. Not in a million years.
I don't rent horses.

683
00:28:12.567 --> 00:28:13.533
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't--

684
00:28:13.667 --> 00:28:16.800
But if you wanna take one
for a ride sometime.

685
00:28:16.934 --> 00:28:18.100
come on by.

686
00:28:19.834 --> 00:28:22.400
Okay. it wasn't that funny.

687
00:28:22.533 --> 00:28:24.867
Joanna told me
that you would say that.

688
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.200
Well. so much
for the man of mystery. huh?

689
00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:30.000
Thank you for watching the boys.

690
00:28:30.133 --> 00:28:32.567
Well. thank you
for fixing the latch.

691
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.100
To protect and serve. ma'am.

692
00:28:34.233 --> 00:28:36.200
It's the lawman's code.

693
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.700
Oh!

694
00:28:42.834 --> 00:28:45.700
You should get yourself
to the saloon on Friday night.

695
00:28:45.834 --> 00:28:48.133
I know. Casey Elfman.

696
00:28:49.033 --> 00:28:50.100
- Joanna told me.
- Ah.

697
00:28:50.233 --> 00:28:51.166
- Yeah.
- Okay.

698
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.567
See you there.

699
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.967
- See you there.
- Okay.

700
00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:05.000
Hey! You made it!

701
00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:07.900
Oh. I wouldn't have
missed this for the world.

702
00:29:08.033 --> 00:29:09.533
- Boone.
- Hey. Tara. How're you doing?

703
00:29:09.667 --> 00:29:11.400
Everyone...

704
00:29:11.533 --> 00:29:12.667
this is Tara Kendall.

705
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.633
She's renting Mom and Dad's
place for the summer.

706
00:29:14.767 --> 00:29:15.667
- Hi.
- Hi.

707
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.133
Slade Barlow.
and I'm shackled to this one.

708
00:29:18.266 --> 00:29:21.333
And grateful
every day of his life for it.

709
00:29:21.467 --> 00:29:23.734
Hutch Carmody.
My wife. Kendra.

710
00:29:23.867 --> 00:29:26.100
Ahh. This is stunning.

711
00:29:26.233 --> 00:29:27.800
Thank you.
Nice to meet you all.

712
00:29:27.934 --> 00:29:29.100
I didn't miss anything.
did I?

713
00:29:29.233 --> 00:29:29.934
- No.
- Nope.

802
00:33:45.066 --> 00:33:46.266
There's no "me and Boone".

803
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.667
Well. it looks like
there could be.

804
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.200
Because we danced?

805
00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:53.266
I have not seen Boone dance
with anyone in a long while.

806
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.333
I just got out of
a terrible divorce

807
00:33:55.467 --> 00:33:57.033
a little over
a year ago. Kendra.

808
00:33:57.166 --> 00:33:59.066
I'm not looking
to get involved with anyone.

809
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.367
This does not
have to be a "forever" thing.

810
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.934
especially seeing as you're only
here until September.

811
00:34:04.066 --> 00:34:06.567
I came to Parable
to unclutter my life.

812
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.867
The last thing I need
is a romantic complication.

813
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.200
All right. fine.
Fair enough.

814
00:34:12.333 --> 00:34:15.600
But thanks for not saying
it's none of my darn business!

815
00:34:16.867 --> 00:34:18.333
It was really great meeting you.

816
00:34:18.467 --> 00:34:19.300
You too.

817
00:34:19.433 --> 00:34:21.433

818
00:34:26.533 --> 00:34:27.734
Morning. boys.

819
00:34:27.867 --> 00:34:28.700
Hi. Tara.

820
00:34:28.834 --> 00:34:30.133
- Hey there.
- Hey.

821
00:34:30.266 --> 00:34:32.367
So. this morning.
you get your choice.

822
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.900
but I gotta be honest.
I gotta warn ya.

823
00:34:35.033 --> 00:34:36.934
Bert...
he's a little ornery.

824
00:34:37.066 --> 00:34:38.600
And Ernie here.
he's even worse.

825
00:34:40.467 --> 00:34:42.433
Hmm.

826
00:34:43.633 --> 00:34:45.900
You don't scare me. Ernie...

827
00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:46.767
Ah-hah!

828
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:48.700
And I have a soft spot
for gingers.

829
00:34:48.834 --> 00:34:50.000
Well. then. Ernie it is.

830
00:34:51.033 --> 00:34:52.767
Uh. any good places
to ride?

831
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.433
Yeah. there's a good trail
behind the house--

832
00:34:54.567 --> 00:34:56.567
winds down to the river.
it's a nice run.

833
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.166
Oh. excellent.

834
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.767
Whoa. Uh...

835
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.200
Any. uh. signposts
I should look for along the way?

836
00:35:05.367 --> 00:35:06.233
I'm definitely going with you.

837
00:35:06.367 --> 00:35:07.767
and I can ride that run
in my sleep.

838
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.300
I'm an experienced rider. Boone.

839
00:35:09.433 --> 00:35:10.300
I don't need a wrangler.

840
00:35:10.433 --> 00:35:11.667
Oh. no. no. no.
It's not for you.

841
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.233
No. it's for Bert.

842
00:35:13.367 --> 00:35:14.834
Yeah. if Ernie takes off
without him.

843
00:35:14.967 --> 00:35:16.533
he's gonna get all jealous--
we can't have that.

844
00:35:16.667 --> 00:35:17.967
Seriously?

845
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.500
Oh. yeah. Right. boys?

846
00:35:19.633 --> 00:35:20.467
True. Tara!

847
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.633
We always ride 'em together.

848
00:35:21.767 --> 00:35:23.400
Always ride 'em together.

849
00:35:23.533 --> 00:35:26.567
Well. you better keep up...

850
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.900
'cause I don't like
being slowed down.

851
00:35:30.033 --> 00:35:31.100
Oh. is that right?

852
00:35:31.233 --> 00:35:32.100
That's right.

853
00:35:32.233 --> 00:35:33.934
- I'll do my best!
- All right. Keep up!

854
00:35:34.066 --> 00:35:36.667
Let's go.

855
00:35:41.066 --> 00:35:43.033
Wow. She can really ride.

856
00:35:43.166 --> 00:35:44.367
She sure can.

857
00:36:08.367 --> 00:36:10.200
This is so beautiful.

858
00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:12.800
Yeah. I never do
get tired of it.

859
00:36:14.233 --> 00:36:16.500
You know.
the first day I was here.

860
00:36:16.633 --> 00:36:19.934
Joanna asked me if--
if I'd come for the views.

861
00:36:20.934 --> 00:36:22.633
In a way. I did.

862
00:36:22.767 --> 00:36:25.166
How did you know
they were here to be seen?

863
00:36:26.266 --> 00:36:28.233
Well. I came here
to Whisper Creek

864
00:36:28.367 --> 00:36:30.233
for a few weeks
when I was 12.

865
00:36:30.367 --> 00:36:31.133
Ah...

866
00:36:31.266 --> 00:36:33.166
Those weeks.

867
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.500
I've carried them with me.

868
00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.200
When I closed my eyes.
I would...

869
00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:42.700
I would see this place.

870
00:36:42.834 --> 00:36:46.567
You know. it carried me through
a lot of rough times.

871
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.533
Yeah. I know
what you're talking about.

872
00:36:48.667 --> 00:36:53.367
This place. this land.
it just gets in your blood.

873
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.300
Now. I don't know about you. but...

874
00:36:56.433 --> 00:36:57.867
riding makes me hungry.

875
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:58.700
Oh. yeah. me too.

876
00:36:58.834 --> 00:37:01.700
Oh!
I'm so happy you said that.

877
00:37:01.834 --> 00:37:03.133
No. you didn't!

878
00:37:03.266 --> 00:37:04.900
Oh. yes. I did.

879
00:37:05.767 --> 00:37:07.633
Thank you so much
for today.

880
00:37:07.767 --> 00:37:10.133
Oh. my gosh. I just--
I love to ride.

881
00:37:10.266 --> 00:37:11.467
You can tell.

882
00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.867
You sit a horse as well
as anyone I've ever seen.

883
00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:17.266
Well. I might be useless
around chickens or raccoons.

884
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.333
but I-- I have been riding
most of my life.

885
00:37:19.467 --> 00:37:21.600
Well. since I came here
as a little girl.

886
00:37:21.734 --> 00:37:23.233
Those first couple of rides.

887
00:37:23.367 --> 00:37:24.767
there's nothing quite like it.

888
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.967
Nope.

889
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.967
No. there surely isn't.

890
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.600
Listen. um...

891
00:37:29.734 --> 00:37:31.066
tell me.

892
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.600
How do you feel
about fish?

893
00:37:32.734 --> 00:37:34.667
I love seafood.

894
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.900
No. no. no.
Not eatin' 'em...

895
00:37:37.033 --> 00:37:38.133
catchin' 'em.

896
00:37:38.266 --> 00:37:41.100
Oh. uh. well. I--
I don't know. I've never tried.

897
00:37:41.233 --> 00:37:43.066
I was gonna go tomorrow.

898
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.100
You could come--
show you how to do it?

899
00:37:46.166 --> 00:37:47.600
Sure. I-I could do that.

900
00:37:47.734 --> 00:37:50.567
Um. oh.
but I refuse to touch worms.

901
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.100
Pathetic city girl.

902
00:37:53.367 --> 00:37:55.734
Come on.
I'll walk you outta here.

903
00:38:07.166 --> 00:38:08.367
Hey!

904
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.467
Hey! I brought some feed.

905
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.467
Thanks.

906
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.133
So? How was the ride?

907
00:38:13.266 --> 00:38:14.934
It was pretty great.

908
00:38:15.066 --> 00:38:16.166
Boone rode with me.

909
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.200
Oh. right. "Bert and Ernie."

910
00:38:18.333 --> 00:38:19.934
They do not like
to be separated.

911
00:38:20.066 --> 00:38:21.200
No. they don't.

912
00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:23.200
You know what he did
that was so sweet?

913
00:38:23.333 --> 00:38:25.166
He brought along
a lunch that he'd made.

914
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.033
Oh. He's a thoughtful guy.

915
00:38:27.166 --> 00:38:28.300
Yeah. and the other day.

916
00:38:28.433 --> 00:38:30.700
he-he fixed that broken window.
without me even asking.

917
00:38:30.834 --> 00:38:32.700
You know. it has been
a long time

918
00:38:32.834 --> 00:38:35.033
since a man's done
nice things for me.

919
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.934
You're starting
to fall for him.

920
00:38:39.233 --> 00:38:41.367
I-I could. I could.
I really could.

921
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.333
But... I can't.

922
00:38:43.467 --> 00:38:44.633
Why not?

923
00:38:44.767 --> 00:38:46.767
Uh. because I'm--
I'm here to regroup.

924
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.600
T-To heal.

925
00:38:48.734 --> 00:38:50.333
Well. maybe
he can help you do that.

926
00:38:50.467 --> 00:38:51.533
I need to do it on my own.

927
00:38:51.667 --> 00:38:53.200
Well. it's going to be hard
to avoid him--

928
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:55.133
him living right next door
to you and all.

929
00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:56.133
I know!

930
00:38:56.266 --> 00:38:57.467
- I mean...
- "I mean" what?

931
00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.166
I-- I--

932
00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.633
He asked me to go fishing
with him tomorrow.

933
00:39:01.767 --> 00:39:02.700
and I said yes.

934
00:39:02.834 --> 00:39:04.200
Is that right?

935
00:39:04.333 --> 00:39:05.600
Why did I do that?

936
00:39:05.734 --> 00:39:08.100
I know I should keep him
at an arm's length.

937
00:39:08.233 --> 00:39:09.600
I know I should.

938
00:39:09.734 --> 00:39:10.867
Well. it sounds to me

939
00:39:11.033 --> 00:39:13.233
like you are not at all sure
about what it is you know.

940
00:39:13.367 --> 00:39:15.033
or what you want.

941
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.300
No. I'm not.

942
00:39:19.467 --> 00:39:21.633
I'm not sure at all.

943
00:39:32.967 --> 00:39:35.967
Oh. that's only because
you haven't caught anything yet.

944
00:39:36.133 --> 00:39:37.133
Do you catch a lot?

945
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:39.233
Most days?
Nothing at all.

946
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.500
But I'm not doing this
for the fish.

947
00:39:41.667 --> 00:39:44.033
For me. this is...

948
00:39:44.133 --> 00:39:46.600
this is meditation.

949
00:39:46.767 --> 00:39:47.767
Yeah. I can see that.

950
00:39:47.934 --> 00:39:49.767
Yeah.

951
00:39:51.133 --> 00:39:53.600
Tell me about Corrie.

952
00:39:53.767 --> 00:39:55.867
What was she like?

953
00:39:56.033 --> 00:39:58.700
My wife...

954
00:39:58.867 --> 00:40:01.500
was so full of life.

955
00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.667
She really was.

956
00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:04.033
She just lit up.

957
00:40:04.133 --> 00:40:06.600
Every single day.
she just lit up.

958
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.700
We were partners.

959
00:40:09.867 --> 00:40:12.500
Best friends.
right from the get-go.

960
00:40:12.667 --> 00:40:14.967
That's the relationship
I was hoping--

961
00:40:15.133 --> 00:40:16.867
wanted--

962
00:40:16.967 --> 00:40:20.333
...expected to have
with James.

963
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.133
No matter how much I gave.

964
00:40:23.233 --> 00:40:25.500
I got next to nothing in return.

965
00:40:25.667 --> 00:40:29.667
It sounds like you're blaming
yourself for the divorce.

966
00:40:29.767 --> 00:40:31.600
Sometimes. it's hard not to.

967
00:40:31.767 --> 00:40:32.934
But no. I don't.

968
00:40:34.066 --> 00:40:36.033
Good. You shouldn't.

969
00:40:37.467 --> 00:40:40.500
You have a strange effect
on me. Boone Taylor.

970
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.066
Do I? "Strange." huh?

971
00:40:45.233 --> 00:40:46.767
"Strange" good?

972
00:40:47.967 --> 00:40:50.934
Well. when you're interested
in a man.

973
00:40:51.066 --> 00:40:53.233
you probably shouldn't
talk to him

974
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.467
about your failed marriage.

975
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.500
yet here I am.

976
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.066
I'm sorry. you lost me when
you said "interested in a man."

977
00:41:03.133 --> 00:41:04.300
Are you?

978
00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:06.867
I am.

979
00:41:12.967 --> 00:41:14.500
Whoa. oh. oh. you got one.
you got one.

980
00:41:14.667 --> 00:41:15.934
You got one!
There you go.

981
00:41:16.066 --> 00:41:16.934
Pull it in. pull it in.
That's it.

982
00:41:17.066 --> 00:41:17.934
You gotta reel it in!

983
00:41:18.066 --> 00:41:19.133
You gotta hold on to the rod.

984
00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.400
No. you're doing great!
Just reel it in. Pull it in.

985
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.400
Yeah.

986
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.867
Okay. hold on.
I gotta get the net!

987
00:41:23.967 --> 00:41:26.200
Bring him in. bring him in!
Bring him in. bring him in!

988
00:41:26.333 --> 00:41:27.867
There you go!

989
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.100
- Look at that!
- Look at that!

990
00:41:29.233 --> 00:41:30.700
You caught your first fish!

991
00:41:30.834 --> 00:41:31.734
Right?

992
00:41:31.867 --> 00:41:34.133
Congratulations.
That was fantastic.

993
00:41:44.233 --> 00:41:46.000
Hello. James.

994
00:41:46.133 --> 00:41:47.433
Tara. hey!

995
00:41:47.567 --> 00:41:49.200
Great to hear your voice.
How are you?

996
00:41:49.333 --> 00:41:50.900
I'm fine.

997
00:41:51.033 --> 00:41:52.667
Uh. why are you calling?

998
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.033
Well. it's... it's Erin.

999
00:41:55.166 --> 00:41:56.100
Is everything okay?

1000
00:41:56.233 --> 00:41:57.667
Not really.
She just chased off

1001
00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.066
the fourth nanny
in three weeks.

1002
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:01.700
and now the agency is refusing
to send anyone else.

1003
00:42:01.834 --> 00:42:03.567
Well. she's getting
a little old to have a nanny.

1004
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.767
She's almost 13.

1005
00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:05.934
Yeah. I know. It's...

1006
00:42:06.066 --> 00:42:08.100
it's not just that.

1007
00:42:08.233 --> 00:42:10.934
It's Bethany--
Erin's being just awful to her.

1008
00:42:11.066 --> 00:42:12.266
I thought.
with me out of the picture.

1009
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.800
this was their time to bond.

1010
00:42:13.934 --> 00:42:15.033
Yeah. that's what I was hoping.

1011
00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:17.100
but it's not exactly
working out that way.

1012
00:42:17.233 --> 00:42:18.633
James. you want something.

1013
00:42:18.767 --> 00:42:20.266
You wouldn't be calling
if you didn't.

1014
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:21.500
so just tell me what it is.

1015
00:42:21.633 --> 00:42:24.233
Erin and Bethany. they need a--
a break from each other.

1016
00:42:24.367 --> 00:42:25.734
and Beth and I need
some time together.

1017
00:42:25.867 --> 00:42:27.433
just the two of us.
without. you know...

1018
00:42:27.567 --> 00:42:29.066
...Without your daughter
getting underfoot?

1019
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.633
I get it. and that's why
you wanted to send her to camp.

1020
00:42:31.767 --> 00:42:33.967
Oh! You--
You know about that?

1021
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.100
Erin and I may not be able
to see each other. James.

1022
00:42:36.233 --> 00:42:37.734
but we still talk.

1023
00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:39.967
Of course. you do.
Okay! There you go.

1024
00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.934
I was thinking that you might
enjoy a visit from her.

1025
00:42:42.066 --> 00:42:43.166
It was her idea. actually.

1026
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:46.000
A couple weeks in the country--
maybe longer?

1027
00:42:46.133 --> 00:42:48.667
Might be good for her.

1028
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.967
I-- I could do that.

1029
00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.000
Really? 'Cause I can get her
on a plane Tuesday.

1030
00:42:52.133 --> 00:42:53.767
or-or Wednesday.
if that works?

1031
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.834
Yeah. either.
Either works fine.

1032
00:42:55.967 --> 00:42:56.867
That would be amazing.

1033
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.567
I'll have my office
make all the arrangements

1034
00:42:58.700 --> 00:42:59.667
and send you the details.

1035
00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.934
Thank you so much. Tara.
I-I really appreciate it.

1036
00:43:02.066 --> 00:43:04.200
You're welcome.

1037
00:43:08.333 --> 00:43:09.633

that helped me with my bags--

1052
00:44:09.667 --> 00:44:11.467
was he a real cowboy?

1053
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:12.767
The genuine article.

1054
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:13.967
How do you know?

1055
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.834
Because he stepped up
and helped without being asked.

1056
00:44:18.066 --> 00:44:19.333
So... what do you think?

1057
00:44:20.367 --> 00:44:21.467
It's awesome.

1058
00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.767
Bawk!

1059
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.166
What's that noise?

1060
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.233
Oh. those are the chickens.

1061
00:44:25.367 --> 00:44:26.934
It's way past
their feeding time.

1062
00:44:27.066 --> 00:44:28.567
They're probably suffering
from low-blood sugar.

1063
00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.133
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

1064
00:44:30.266 --> 00:44:32.500
Oh. We got company.

1065
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.934
- Oh. hey. guys!
- Hi there.

1066
00:44:35.066 --> 00:44:36.467
The boys saw you drive up

1067
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.767
and they just had
to come and say hi.

1068
00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.700
Hi. I'm Fletcher.
This is Griffin.

1069
00:44:40.834 --> 00:44:41.934
I'm Erin.

1070
00:44:42.066 --> 00:44:43.867
Dad says
you're like Tara's daughter.

1071
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.333
but not her daughter?

1072
00:44:45.467 --> 00:44:46.233
Ooh...

1073
00:44:46.367 --> 00:44:47.934
Awkward. buddy!
Sorry!

1074
00:44:49.433 --> 00:44:51.800
Kind of.
It's a long story.

1075
00:44:53.133 --> 00:44:54.433
Okay. can I help you
with the luggage?

1076
00:44:54.567 --> 00:44:55.867
- Sure.
- Great.

1077
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.500
Uh... Here we go.

1078
00:44:57.633 --> 00:45:00.567
Automatic. All right.

1079
00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:03.967
Oh!

1080
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.200
Okay.

1081
00:45:08.333 --> 00:45:09.500
Let me help you
with one of those.

1082
00:45:09.633 --> 00:45:10.500
They're heavy.

1083
00:45:10.633 --> 00:45:12.767
No. no. it's fine.
It's balanced this way.

1084
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.734
These both hers?

1085
00:45:13.867 --> 00:45:14.667
Yeah.

1086
00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.367
She's planning on
staying a while.

1087
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.367
I hope so.

1088
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.834
What happened
to the convertible?

1089
00:45:18.967 --> 00:45:21.367
I traded it in.
Didn't feel right anymore.

1090
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.700
Your dad's a real cowboy.

1091
00:45:23.834 --> 00:45:25.800
Oh. yeah. Definitely.

1092
00:45:34.734 --> 00:45:35.700
I'm glad. too.

1093
00:45:35.834 --> 00:45:37.734
Or make me
hang out with Bethany.

1094
00:45:37.867 --> 00:45:40.734
It know it's hard having
a new woman in your dad's life

1095
00:45:40.867 --> 00:45:42.000
and learning to get along
with her.

1096
00:45:42.133 --> 00:45:43.900
but it will be
so much better for you.

1097
00:45:44.033 --> 00:45:45.734
if you do.

1098
00:45:45.867 --> 00:45:46.567
I mean...

1099
00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.266
you should at least try.

1100
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.233
I guess.

1101
00:45:53.166 --> 00:45:54.800
Oh! Do you remember
my friend Savannah?

1102
00:45:54.934 --> 00:45:56.734
Yeah. of course.

1103
00:45:56.867 --> 00:46:00.500
Well. she got a nose stud
and it looks awesome.

1104
00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:02.800
Is that right?

1105
00:46:02.934 --> 00:46:04.333
Yeah. So...

1106
00:46:04.467 --> 00:46:06.467
I was thinking. while I'm here.

1107
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.533
why don't I get one. too?

1108
00:46:08.667 --> 00:46:11.166
My answer was "no" in New York.
and it's "no" now.

1109
00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.433
not without your dad's consent.

1110
00:46:13.567 --> 00:46:15.700
He didn't even want you to get
your ears pierced. remember?

1111
00:46:15.834 --> 00:46:17.867
Well. Dad doesn't even care
what I do anymore.

1112
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.867
Well. I do.

1113
00:46:20.867 --> 00:46:22.867
Boone seems like a nice guy.

1114
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.100
He is.

1115
00:46:24.233 --> 00:46:26.867
Are you guys. like. dating?

1116
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.633
No. Not really.
Just friends.

1117
00:46:29.767 --> 00:46:31.266
"Not really"?

1118
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.433
He invited us over
for a barbecue this weekend.

1119
00:46:33.567 --> 00:46:35.166
You'll get to meet
some of my other new friends.

1120
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.467
- Cool.
- Mm-hmm.

1121
00:47:29.367 --> 00:47:31.934
Too lazy to walk over here
and talk to me in person?

1122
00:47:32.066 --> 00:47:33.567
I wasn't invited.

1123
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:34.767
I'm about to turn in.

1124
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.033
Yeah. I think
I might do the same thing.

1125
00:47:37.166 --> 00:47:39.600
She's out cold.

1126
00:47:39.734 --> 00:47:42.000
Fell asleep as soon
her head hit the pillow.

1127
00:47:42.133 --> 00:47:43.133
Well. of course. she did.

1128
00:47:43.266 --> 00:47:44.266
She traveled 2.000 miles today

1129
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.433
without benefit
of covered wagon.

1130
00:47:46.567 --> 00:47:48.533
Hey. what can we bring
to the barbecue?

1131
00:47:48.667 --> 00:47:51.500
I make a killer
red cabbage coleslaw.

1132
00:47:51.633 --> 00:47:55.000
Oh. yeah. bring that.
That sounds fantastic.

1133
00:47:55.133 --> 00:47:57.500
Well. um...

1134
00:47:57.633 --> 00:47:59.033
goodnight.

1135
00:48:03.233 --> 00:48:05.200
Goodnight.

1136
00:48:17.233 --> 00:48:18.300
Thank you.

1137
00:48:18.433 --> 00:48:19.567
Tara!

1138
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.333
- Hi!
- Hi.

1139
00:48:21.467 --> 00:48:24.967
I am still buzzing from
that show you did at the saloon.

1140
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.066
Oh. me too.

1141
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.400
Now. how are things going
with your step-daughter?

1142
00:48:28.533 --> 00:48:30.600
News travels fast
in a small town.

1143
00:48:30.734 --> 00:48:32.633
Because we're desperate for it.

1144
00:48:32.767 --> 00:48:34.400
We're having a great time.

1145
00:48:34.533 --> 00:48:37.100
She's out riding
with Griffin Taylor right now.

1146
00:48:37.233 --> 00:48:38.300
Oh. good for her.

1147
00:48:38.433 --> 00:48:39.467
Yeah.

1148
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.900
I have to admit. though.

1149
00:48:41.033 --> 00:48:42.533
it's bittersweet
having her here.

1150
00:48:42.667 --> 00:48:43.867
Why's that?

1151
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.266
Well. she's only here
because it suits my ex. James.

1152
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.166
Ah. One of those.

1153
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.100
The kind of man I like to call
"Controllo".

1154
00:48:50.233 --> 00:48:52.500
It's always their way
or the highway.

1155
00:48:52.633 --> 00:48:53.767
Yeah. That would be James.

1156
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.600
Oh. they can charm
the pants off you at first.

1157
00:48:55.734 --> 00:48:57.667
make you feel like you're
the center of the universe.

1158
00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:58.800
but once
they got you hooked--

1159
00:48:58.934 --> 00:49:00.667
bam!
...the other shoe drops.

1160
00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.500
Hmph. Yeah. I can relate.

1161
00:49:03.633 --> 00:49:05.033
Problem is.

1162
00:49:05.166 --> 00:49:07.166
those are the kind of guys
I'm attracted to--

1163
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.600
someone who's
as strong-willed as I am.

1164
00:49:09.734 --> 00:49:11.533
Mm. That is a problem.

1165
00:49:11.667 --> 00:49:12.834
Still...

1166
00:49:12.967 --> 00:49:15.633
might be nice to have
a kind. considerate sweetheart

1167
00:49:15.767 --> 00:49:17.667
to come home to.

1168
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.233
Who knows?

1169
00:49:19.367 --> 00:49:21.700
Okay. is everyone in Parable
a matchmaker?

1170
00:49:21.834 --> 00:49:23.467
Well. we look out for our own.

1171
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.033
-
- Good afternoon. ladies.

1172
00:49:25.166 --> 00:49:27.200
I've got two-and-a-half dozen
for you today. Leonard.

1173
00:49:27.333 --> 00:49:29.000
Okay.
I'll put it on your account.

1174
00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:30.934
I'll see you later. sweetie.

1175
00:49:43.033 --> 00:49:45.100
Okay. Try some.

1176
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:53.467
And... the verdict is?

1177
00:49:54.633 --> 00:49:56.200
This rocks!

1178
00:49:56.333 --> 00:49:58.500
You make the best coleslaw...
"Tara."

1179
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.767
See? It's getting easier
to say. isn't it?

1180
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.900
Not even a little bit.

1181
00:50:04.967 --> 00:50:07.066
Now let's go meet Dawson!

1182
00:50:12.967 --> 00:50:15.000
Nice hit. Dawson!

1183
00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.500
That's my boy.

1184
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.567
Well. that wasn't very good.

1185
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.734
Not very good?
That was pathetic! Boomerang.

1186
00:50:28.867 --> 00:50:29.900
Let's try that one more time.

1187
00:50:30.033 --> 00:50:31.300
I'm gonna help you
a little bit more.

1188
00:50:31.433 --> 00:50:32.867
- Okay.
- Okay. here we go.

1189
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.166
Get a nice. smooth stroke going.
That's it.

1190
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.467
And. at the top of the arc.
you let it go.

1191
00:50:38.333 --> 00:50:39.600
Here we go...

1192
00:50:40.467 --> 00:50:41.200
- Oh!
-

1193
00:50:41.333 --> 00:50:42.333
- Oh. yeah!
-

1194
00:50:42.467 --> 00:50:43.367
Yes!

1195
00:50:52.133 --> 00:50:53.000
- Babe.
- Thank you.

1196
00:50:53.133 --> 00:50:54.834
No problemo.

1197
00:50:54.967 --> 00:50:56.567
Try not to burn the next ones.

1198
00:50:57.633 --> 00:50:59.500
Okay. I never burn them!

1199
00:50:59.633 --> 00:51:00.700
He always burns them.

1200
00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:04.100
It looks like soccer's
made its way into Parable.

1201
00:51:04.233 --> 00:51:05.033
Not quite.

1202
00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:06.533
Dawson tried
to put a team together--

1203
00:51:06.667 --> 00:51:07.600
no luck.

1204
00:51:07.734 --> 00:51:09.967
Mm. It's pretty hard
to field any kind of team

1205
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.934
with a school
as small as ours.

1206
00:51:12.066 --> 00:51:13.767
Mm. And speaking of school--

1207
00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.400
I can't believe the wonders
that you have worked on my boy.

1208
00:51:16.533 --> 00:51:17.567
You know. I caught him

1209
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.734
reading under the covers
the other day?

1210
00:51:19.867 --> 00:51:21.533
The Count of Monte Cristo.

1211
00:51:21.667 --> 00:51:24.767
Uh. you got Dawson reading?

1212
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:25.800
I just pointed him

1213
00:51:25.934 --> 00:51:27.233
towards the books
I thought he might like.

1214
00:51:27.367 --> 00:51:30.233
Aw. do you think you could
get Hutch to read next?

1215
00:51:30.367 --> 00:51:32.033
Oh. then she really would be
a wonder-worker.

1216
00:51:32.166 --> 00:51:33.467
Yeah. she would be.

1217
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.433
You know. I thought about
being a teacher

1218
00:51:35.567 --> 00:51:37.066
when I was younger.

1219
00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.633
Truth is. the thought

1220
00:51:38.767 --> 00:51:42.367
of facing a room full of kids
every day

1221
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.467
scared the heck out of me.

1222
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.133
Oh. it can be daunting.
for sure.

1223
00:51:46.266 --> 00:51:48.033
but when it clicks...

1224
00:51:48.166 --> 00:51:49.734
that's the rewarding part.

1225
00:51:49.867 --> 00:51:50.800
and that's why I do it.

1226
00:51:50.934 --> 00:51:53.433
but it's the other stuff
that drives you nuts--

1227
00:51:53.567 --> 00:51:56.133
the endless staff meetings.
budget crunches.

1228
00:51:56.266 --> 00:51:57.633
school-board interference.

1229
00:51:57.767 --> 00:51:59.767
Oh. we don't have
any of that here.

1230
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.567
Well. not a lot anyway.

1231
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.200
I basically am
the school board.

1232
00:52:04.333 --> 00:52:05.500
Whoa!

1233
00:52:05.633 --> 00:52:07.500
Hoo. hoo. hoo. hoo!
It's on!

1234
00:52:07.633 --> 00:52:08.600
This is on.

1235
00:52:08.734 --> 00:52:10.200
- It is on!
- Yep. it is on.

1236
00:52:10.333 --> 00:52:11.700
Where are you going?

1237
00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.233
Mom?

1238
00:52:30.367 --> 00:52:32.200
So. Dawson wanted to know

1239
00:52:32.333 --> 00:52:34.800
if I can go see the movies
with him later this week?

1240
00:52:34.934 --> 00:52:36.300
Can I?

1241
00:52:36.433 --> 00:52:37.800
I don't see why not.

1242
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.934
All right. 'kay. listen to me.
I gotta know.

1243
00:52:46.066 --> 00:52:47.266
Know what?

1244
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.200
Have you asked her out yet?

1245
00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:51.700
Yeah. well. we went. uh...

1246
00:52:51.834 --> 00:52:53.834
went riding. went fishin'.

1247
00:52:53.967 --> 00:52:56.133
Ladies like to be
wined and dined. Boone.

1248
00:52:56.266 --> 00:52:58.834
Well. sometimes. yes.
but not always.

1249
00:52:58.967 --> 00:53:01.300
Oh. now you're an expert
on women?

1250
00:53:01.433 --> 00:53:04.233
I'm just trying to get to know
and understand this one.

1251
00:53:04.367 --> 00:53:05.567
Oh. boy.

1252
00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:07.633
You're serious about her.

1253
00:53:07.767 --> 00:53:09.934
I guess I am.

1254
00:53:10.066 --> 00:53:11.033
You know...

1255
00:53:11.166 --> 00:53:13.367
she's not what you think she is.
at first glance.

1256
00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:14.667
City-slicker?

1257
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:17.033
Come on. guys.
No. no. she's. um...

1258
00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:21.600
She's got real heart. you know?
She's got grit.

1259
00:53:21.734 --> 00:53:23.100
And she's smart as a whip.

1260
00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:24.700
Man. can she ride!

1261
00:53:26.233 --> 00:53:29.500
You know. I think we used
to know a woman just like that.

1262
00:53:29.633 --> 00:53:31.567
You're right.

1263
00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.200
Corrie would've
liked her a lot.

1264
00:53:35.233 --> 00:53:38.000
I think she'd be rooting
for you. pal.

1265
00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.533
All right. then.

1266
00:53:42.667 --> 00:53:46.400
You guys are too soft--
too soft.

1267
00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.600
Hey there.

1268
00:53:49.734 --> 00:53:51.667
You should. uh. you should
take some of these leftovers.

1269
00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.767
'cause I don't think

1270
00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:54.033
the boys and I are
gonna get through all this.

1271
00:53:54.166 --> 00:53:55.533
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1272
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.367
I had a really nice time
today. Boone.

1273
00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.266
Yeah. I did. too.

1274
00:54:04.633 --> 00:54:06.266
Come on. let's get you
some more food. all right?

1275
00:54:16.533 --> 00:54:18.667
Yeah.

1276
00:54:20.033 --> 00:54:22.500
Can you brush my hair.
like you used to?

1277
00:54:22.633 --> 00:54:24.600
Sure.

1278
00:54:27.934 --> 00:54:29.133
Today was fun.

1279
00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:31.633
It sure was.

1280
00:54:31.767 --> 00:54:33.533
You really like it here.
don't you?

1281
00:54:33.667 --> 00:54:34.900
I love it here.

1282
00:54:35.033 --> 00:54:37.266
Don't you?

1283
00:54:38.367 --> 00:54:40.000
I guess.

1284
00:54:40.133 --> 00:54:42.133
What is it?

1285
00:54:42.266 --> 00:54:43.734
When summer's over.

1286
00:54:43.867 --> 00:54:45.700
you're coming back
to New York. right?

1287
00:54:45.834 --> 00:54:47.467
Of course.
I'm coming back.

1288
00:54:49.633 --> 00:54:51.533
You won't let Boone
talk you into staying?

1289
00:54:51.667 --> 00:54:52.867
Boone?

1290
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.700
I see the way you guys
look at each other.

1291
00:54:54.834 --> 00:54:57.533
I told you. he's...
he's just a friend.

1292
00:54:57.667 --> 00:55:00.166
Even if he does love you?

1293
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.567
He doesn't love me.

1294
00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.300
Well. he's never gonna love you
as much as I do.

1295
00:55:07.433 --> 00:55:08.734
Oh.

1296
00:55:08.867 --> 00:55:11.300
Sweetheart. you are
the heart and soul of me.

1297
00:55:11.433 --> 00:55:13.233
Nothing's ever
gonna change that.

1298
00:55:13.367 --> 00:55:15.567
Not Boone. not anyone.

1299
00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.233
All right? Come here.

1300
00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.934
I know you like her. Dad.

1301
00:55:31.066 --> 00:55:32.066
Oh. do you. now?

1302
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.533
I like her. too.

1303
00:55:33.667 --> 00:55:34.800
I don't.

1304
00:55:34.934 --> 00:55:37.066
You like her
even though she's a girl?

1305
00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.900
Moms aren't girls.

1306
00:55:39.033 --> 00:55:40.800
She's not our mom!

1307
00:55:42.066 --> 00:55:43.467
Griff. Hey.

1308
00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.934
Uh. listen. pal. you just finish
brushing your teeth. okay?

1309
00:55:46.066 --> 00:55:47.800
Get in bed. I'll come tuck
you in in a minute. all right?

1310
00:55:47.934 --> 00:55:49.700
- Okay.
- Thattaboy.

1311
00:56:03.333 --> 00:56:04.767
Wanna talk about it?

1312
00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.767
Tch.

1313
00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:15.367
Come here. Come on.

1314
00:56:21.967 --> 00:56:23.834
You hate the idea

1315
00:56:23.967 --> 00:56:26.433
of someone taking
your mom's place.

1316
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:29.500
I know.

1317
00:56:29.633 --> 00:56:32.000
I know because I have...

1318
00:56:32.133 --> 00:56:35.700
felt that way
for a very long time. myself.

1319
00:56:39.333 --> 00:56:41.600
You see...

1320
00:56:41.734 --> 00:56:43.667
your mom

1321
00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.934
was so special.

1322
00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.700
She just loved us.

1323
00:56:49.834 --> 00:56:52.533
That's all.

1324
00:56:52.667 --> 00:56:54.633
She plain old loved us.

1325
00:56:54.767 --> 00:56:56.367
No ifs. ands. or buts.

1326
00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:00.200
If we were happy.
she was happy.

1327
00:57:05.467 --> 00:57:07.700
You didn't know this. though...

1328
00:57:10.367 --> 00:57:13.433
...after your mom got sick.

1329
00:57:13.567 --> 00:57:16.433
we used to have these talks--

1330
00:57:16.567 --> 00:57:17.667
late at night.
just the two of us.

1331
00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.300
after you guys went to bed.

1332
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.700
Oh. she made me laugh.

1333
00:57:25.834 --> 00:57:29.800
talking about all the good times
that we'd had.

1334
00:57:31.667 --> 00:57:33.834
And she made me promise her

1335
00:57:33.967 --> 00:57:36.233
that I would always
keep this house

1336
00:57:36.367 --> 00:57:38.867
full of love and fun.

1337
00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.033
And she said...

1338
00:57:47.166 --> 00:57:48.367
"Babe.

1339
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:52.166
don't you spend
the rest of your life

1340
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.533
pining for me.

1341
00:57:53.667 --> 00:57:55.567
You go live your life."

1342
00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.834
Did she really say that?

1343
00:58:00.166 --> 00:58:02.600
She did. bud.

1344
00:58:02.734 --> 00:58:05.233
And she meant it. too.

1345
00:58:05.367 --> 00:58:07.066
I didn't mean
what I said before.

1346
00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.133
I do like Tara.

1347
00:58:08.266 --> 00:58:10.166
I know you do.

1348
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.633
But you don't have to worry.

1349
00:58:11.767 --> 00:58:14.100
She's not aiming
to be anybody's new mom.

1350
00:58:14.233 --> 00:58:15.433
Not anytime soon.

1351
00:58:15.567 --> 00:58:17.467
I'll still never forget Mom.

1352
00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:18.767
Not ever.

1353
00:58:20.867 --> 00:58:22.333
Attaboy.

1354
00:59:05.967 --> 00:59:07.367
Hey!
- Whoa...

1355
00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.300
-
- Afternoon.

1356
00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.066
Um. ahem. so...

1357
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:14.066
just as I was
congratulating myself

1358
00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.333
on how on top of things
I was getting.

1359
00:59:16.467 --> 00:59:18.567
and how I was never gonna
have to ask my neighbor

1360
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.667
for help for anything
ever again...

1361
00:59:21.934 --> 00:59:23.000
What's wrong?

1362
00:59:23.133 --> 00:59:25.333
A problem with my water.

1363
00:59:26.767 --> 00:59:28.400
Okay. Sure.
Let's have a look.

1364
00:59:28.533 --> 00:59:29.800
Oh!

1365
00:59:29.934 --> 00:59:31.700
Hey. Boone Taylor.

1366
00:59:31.834 --> 00:59:34.333
Are you a closet
abstract expressionist?

1367
00:59:34.467 --> 00:59:35.834
Is it that bad? Really?

1368
00:59:35.967 --> 00:59:38.033
Ah. they look like floor plans.

1369
00:59:38.166 --> 00:59:39.967
Yeah. I used to love doing
stuff like this. you know?

1370
00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.800
Coming up with an idea
and then bringing it to life.

1371
00:59:44.133 --> 00:59:46.166
Yeah. Haven't done that
in a long time.

1372
00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:50.500
We should see about that water.

1373
00:59:50.633 --> 00:59:51.734
Okay.

1374
00:59:51.867 --> 00:59:53.467
Show me.

1375
00:59:54.633 --> 00:59:55.967
That was so funny.

1376
00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:57.667
Yeah. kinda
unrealistic. though.

1377
00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.300
It was a movie.

1378
01:00:00.533 --> 01:00:03.834
My favorite part
was the car chase.

1379
01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:04.867
Yeah. That was cool.

1380
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.033
Yeah.

1381
01:00:06.166 --> 01:00:07.900
What time
does Tara pick you up at?

1382
01:00:08.033 --> 01:00:10.166
Not for a bit.

1383
01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.867
Wanna get some ice cream?

1384
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.433
Yeah. sounds great.

1385
01:00:17.767 --> 01:00:19.000
Hmm.

1386
01:00:19.133 --> 01:00:20.400
What's the matter with it?

1387
01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:22.667
That's a good question. Uh...

1388
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.200
Hmm.

1389
01:00:26.333 --> 01:00:27.700
That.

1390
01:00:27.834 --> 01:00:29.233
That is the problem.

1391
01:00:29.367 --> 01:00:30.400
Come on.

1392
01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.200
Wow. This is awesome.

1393
01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:35.500
Yeah. I think so.

1394
01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:38.633
but I don't really have much
to compare it to.

1395
01:00:38.767 --> 01:00:41.200
It's as good as anything
I've had in New York. for sure.

1396
01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:42.633
Wow. New York.

1397
01:00:42.767 --> 01:00:44.900
Just the idea of it
makes me nervous.

1398
01:00:45.033 --> 01:00:46.800
It's not as scary as it looks.

1399
01:00:46.934 --> 01:00:47.834
You always lived there?

1400
01:00:47.967 --> 01:00:48.800
Born and raised.

1401
01:00:48.934 --> 01:00:50.834
Wow. Same here.

1402
01:00:50.967 --> 01:00:54.533
Uh. born and raised here.
not there.

1403
01:00:54.667 --> 01:00:57.967
Thanks for the clarification.
Had me confused there.

1404
01:01:01.834 --> 01:01:03.367
Do we fix it?

1405
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.233
Well. the pipe's
gonna need to be replaced.

1406
01:01:05.367 --> 01:01:06.900
I can talk to Joanna
about that.

1407
01:01:07.033 --> 01:01:08.367
I patched it
with some plumber's tape.

1408
01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.567
That ought to hold it
for a while.

1409
01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:13.367
You just happened
to have plumber's tape?

1410
01:01:14.834 --> 01:01:16.033
What kinda handyman
do you take me for?

1411
01:01:16.166 --> 01:01:18.467
Of course. I got plumber's tape.

1412
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.633
Will you show me how to do it?

1413
01:01:20.767 --> 01:01:22.900
In case it happens again?

1414
01:01:24.233 --> 01:01:26.533
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I can do that.

1415
01:01:27.633 --> 01:01:30.800
We should go inside
and. um. cool off.

1416
01:01:30.934 --> 01:01:32.400
I agree.

1417
01:01:32.533 --> 01:01:34.100
Okay. let's go.

1418
01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:36.400
Ahem.

1419
01:01:36.533 --> 01:01:37.734
So. uh...

1420
01:01:37.867 --> 01:01:40.900
Boone's boys tell me
that Tara's not really your mom.

1421
01:01:41.033 --> 01:01:43.600
Well. she married my dad
when I was little. so...

1422
01:01:43.734 --> 01:01:45.066
she's more like my mom
than my stepmom.

1423
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:46.700
It's... complicated.

1424
01:01:46.834 --> 01:01:49.033
Yeah. they told me that. too.

1425
01:01:49.166 --> 01:01:51.066
You know. the divorce?

1426
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.667
It's the worst.

1427
01:01:55.567 --> 01:01:57.533
Ahh. That is so good.

1428
01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:58.533
Mm.

1429
01:01:58.667 --> 01:02:00.033
Here. Wash off.

1430
01:02:00.166 --> 01:02:01.967
I'll... pour you another.

1431
01:02:02.166 --> 01:02:03.133
Thank you.

1432
01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:10.100
Are you sure
you don't want me to wait?

1433
01:02:10.233 --> 01:02:12.633
No. Tara's never late.

1434
01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:16.433
Um. I'd stay.
but I have chores.

1435
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:18.867
What?

1436
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.600
Chores. Just sounds...

1437
01:02:20.734 --> 01:02:21.667
...Parable?

1438
01:02:23.233 --> 01:02:26.033
Thanks for the movie.
And the ice cream.

1439
01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:27.333
Yeah. of course.

1440
01:02:27.467 --> 01:02:30.133
Thanks for. you know.
coming along with me.

1441
01:02:30.266 --> 01:02:32.500
Maybe we could do it again
sometime?

1442
01:02:32.633 --> 01:02:34.934
Yeah. that'd be awesome.

1443
01:02:35.066 --> 01:02:37.967
Uh. you said
something about chores?

1444
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.967
Yeah! Yeah. You're right. Chores.

1445
01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:42.033
I'd better get to that.

1446
01:02:42.166 --> 01:02:43.800
Well...

1447
01:02:43.934 --> 01:02:45.633
it was really nice to see you.

1448
01:02:45.767 --> 01:02:46.934
- Yeah.
- Bye.

1449
01:02:47.066 --> 01:02:49.033
Bye.

1450
01:02:54.166 --> 01:02:57.000
You...
you missed a spot.

1451
01:02:57.133 --> 01:02:58.133
Oh. did I? Where?

1452
01:02:58.266 --> 01:03:00.734
Right... right here.

1453
01:03:00.867 --> 01:03:02.367
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1454
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.266
Any better?

1455
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.600
Little bit. yeah.

1456
01:03:08.233 --> 01:03:10.266
Listen...

1457
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I've been meaning to ask you...

1458
01:03:16.133 --> 01:03:17.767
any more. uh...

1459
01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.100
raccoon home invasions?

1460
01:03:20.533 --> 01:03:22.200
Just the one.

1461
01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.400
Good.

1462
01:03:24.533 --> 01:03:26.834
I make sure
to latch the windows.

1463
01:03:28.133 --> 01:03:30.800
Well. you can never
be too careful.

1464
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.600
Hoo...

1465
01:03:44.734 --> 01:03:46.900
It's been a while
since I've done that.

1466
01:03:47.033 --> 01:03:48.200
Yeah.

1467
01:03:48.333 --> 01:03:49.567
Me too.

1468
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:50.667
Hmm.

1469
01:04:02.867 --> 01:04:04.767
Felt pretty good. though.

1470
01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:07.300
Mm-hmm. Yes.

1471
01:04:07.433 --> 01:04:08.734
It did.

1472
01:04:09.767 --> 01:04:11.266
-

1473
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.767
Oh.

1474
01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.500
-
- Ahem.

1475
01:04:16.266 --> 01:04:18.433
It's... I'm supposed
to pick up Erin.

1476
01:04:18.567 --> 01:04:19.734
Uh. she's--

1477
01:04:19.867 --> 01:04:22.400
she went to the movies
with Dawson.

1478
01:04:22.533 --> 01:04:23.934
Dawson's a good kid.

1479
01:04:24.066 --> 01:04:27.066
Um. I guess I'll let you
get to it. then.

1480
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.300
Yeah.

1481
01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:30.500
Okay.

1482
01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:31.767
Uh...

1483
01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:35.500
I will come by later
with some more plumber's tape.

1484
01:04:35.633 --> 01:04:36.934
I'll show you how to do it.

1485
01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.500
Thanks. Yeah.

1486
01:04:39.633 --> 01:04:41.467
Yeah.

1487
01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.567
Right. Gotta go.

1488
01:04:57.233 --> 01:04:58.734
Uh. Tara!

1489
01:04:58.867 --> 01:05:00.934
- Hey!
- Hi. Kendra!

1490
01:05:01.066 --> 01:05:02.800
Hi.

1491
01:05:02.934 --> 01:05:03.934
Hi!

1492
01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.834
This is fate.

1493
01:05:05.967 --> 01:05:07.200
I was just gonna call you.

1494
01:05:07.333 --> 01:05:08.333
Oh? What's up?

1495
01:05:08.467 --> 01:05:10.200
Well. one of our teachers
got married in June.

1496
01:05:10.333 --> 01:05:11.467
Oh. that's nice.

1497
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.166
Yeah. but now she's moving
and we have to replace her.

1498
01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.367
Are you interested?

1499
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.000
- In teaching?
- Yeah.

1500
01:05:17.133 --> 01:05:18.934
- Here?
- Yes!

1501
01:05:19.066 --> 01:05:21.767
Now. we can't pay as well as
you would get paid in New York.

1502
01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.667
but our cost of living
is so much lower.

1503
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.834
and we have
super-small class sizes.

1504
01:05:25.967 --> 01:05:29.133
and you would have
a super-supportive school board.

1505
01:05:29.266 --> 01:05:30.200
who'd always have your back.

1506
01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:31.333
Hmm.

1507
01:05:31.467 --> 01:05:33.467
How much time
did you spend on this pitch?

1508
01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.367
Oh...

1509
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.800
It's pretty good though. right?

1510
01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:38.200
It's good.

1511
01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:40.934
But I have a job
back in New York

1512
01:05:41.066 --> 01:05:43.333
and-and a lease
and a social life.

1513
01:05:43.467 --> 01:05:45.433
and a daughter
that I need to be near to.

1514
01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:47.600
And endless staff meetings.
budget crunches...

1515
01:05:47.734 --> 01:05:49.433
...painful memories.

1516
01:05:49.567 --> 01:05:51.300
Oh. stop it!
You're tempting me.

1517
01:05:51.433 --> 01:05:52.300
Oh!

1518
01:05:52.433 --> 01:05:53.300
I had to ask.

1519
01:05:53.433 --> 01:05:54.367
And I appreciate it.

1520
01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.333
Well. we appreciate you.

1521
01:05:56.467 --> 01:05:58.533
You know. you have made
a whole lot of friends

1522
01:05:58.667 --> 01:05:59.600
in a real short time.

1523
01:05:59.734 --> 01:06:00.667
You should know that.

1524
01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.433
Thank you. and I...

1525
01:06:02.567 --> 01:06:03.600
I feel the same way.

1526
01:06:03.734 --> 01:06:04.700
Good.

1527
01:06:04.834 --> 01:06:06.600
Well. you enjoy
rest of your day.

1528
01:06:06.734 --> 01:06:08.367
- Thank you. You too.
- Thanks. I will.

1529
01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:12.033
Think about it!

1530
01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.934
Hey!

1531
01:06:28.066 --> 01:06:30.333
Hey.

1532
01:06:30.467 --> 01:06:33.734
Shouldn't you be out tracking
rustlers and horse thieves?

1533
01:06:33.867 --> 01:06:35.600
Ah. it's a lot of paperwork.

1534
01:06:35.734 --> 01:06:38.066
Anyway. it's my lunchbreak
and. uh...

1535
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.266
well. I really just wanted
to bring you those.

1536
01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.400
Oh. Wow. Thank you.

1537
01:06:43.533 --> 01:06:44.600
They're beautiful.

1538
01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:47.066
I was just wondering that--

1539
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.066
you know. maybe if you...

1540
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.734
weren't busy--

1541
01:06:50.867 --> 01:06:52.000
I mean. obviously. you're busy.

1542
01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:54.033
but if you weren't busy
at some point.

1543
01:06:54.166 --> 01:06:56.834
maybe you would want
to go out-- with me...

1544
01:06:56.967 --> 01:06:58.100
This is going badly!

1545
01:06:58.233 --> 01:07:00.033
Um. I can do
way better than this.

1546
01:07:01.367 --> 01:07:03.734
Are you-- Are you asking me
out on a date?

1547
01:07:03.867 --> 01:07:05.667
Yes. ma'am. I am trying.

1548
01:07:07.367 --> 01:07:10.033
Should we really
be doing this?

1549
01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:13.967
I don't know. I can't really
think of any reason why not.

1550
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:15.967
The problem is.

1551
01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.567
I could
really fall for you. Boone.

1552
01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:20.834
I...

1553
01:07:20.967 --> 01:07:24.200
to be honest.
I think I already have.

1554
01:07:25.233 --> 01:07:27.800
Well. I'd be lying
if I didn't say

1555
01:07:27.934 --> 01:07:30.100
that was truly wonderful
to hear.

1556
01:07:32.934 --> 01:07:36.500
And as wonderful
as it is to say. I...

1557
01:07:39.033 --> 01:07:40.900
I don't know
that I'm ready for it.

1558
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.500
Hmm.

1559
01:07:44.633 --> 01:07:46.767
Well...

1560
01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:48.900
I don't know.

1561
01:07:49.033 --> 01:07:51.934
That kiss the other day
felt pretty ready to me.

1562
01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.100
It's not
that I don't want to try.

1563
01:07:57.233 --> 01:07:58.967
with you.

1564
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.500
I do.

1565
01:08:01.633 --> 01:08:04.367
I'm just...

1566
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.533
I'm scared.

1567
01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:08.567
So am I.

1568
01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.633
I am very scared.

1569
01:08:11.767 --> 01:08:13.900
Look.

1570
01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:18.300
Why don't we just take it
one date at a time?

1571
01:08:20.467 --> 01:08:21.734
I could do that.

1572
01:08:21.867 --> 01:08:23.867
So it's a date?

1573
01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.066
It's a date.

1574
01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:27.633
Hot dang!

1575
01:08:33.867 --> 01:08:35.467
I'm glad you like the flowers.

1576
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.000
Me too.

1577
01:08:38.133 --> 01:08:39.667
Okay. I'll see you soon.

1578
01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.767
Okay.

1579
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.100
Tara?

1580
01:08:56.166 --> 01:08:58.166
What is it. sweetheart?
What's the matter?

1581
01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.266
It's from Dad.

1582
01:09:04.567 --> 01:09:06.667
Oh. honey. come here.

1583
01:09:08.567 --> 01:09:11.166
It's gonna be okay.

1584
01:09:20.533 --> 01:09:21.767
Tara. hey.

1585
01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:23.400
You're getting married?

1586
01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:25.633
Yeah. I am.

1587
01:09:25.767 --> 01:09:26.967
Next week.

1588
01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:28.333
It's-- it's kinda crazy. right?

1589
01:09:28.467 --> 01:09:29.934
This isn't right. James.

1590
01:09:30.066 --> 01:09:31.300
Okay. I know

1591
01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:32.700
you're still mourning
our marriage--

1592
01:09:32.834 --> 01:09:34.533
No. no. no. no. Don't. Don't.
This isn't about us.

1593
01:09:34.667 --> 01:09:35.734
This is about Erin.

1594
01:09:35.867 --> 01:09:36.967
Oh! You--

1595
01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.233
Right.

1596
01:09:38.367 --> 01:09:41.367
Look. I'm sorry to cut
your little visit short.

1597
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.600
but obviously. we're not gonna
get married without her here.

1598
01:09:43.734 --> 01:09:46.200
Did it occur to you.
even for a second.

1599
01:09:46.333 --> 01:09:49.300
that sending your daughter
an e-mail

1600
01:09:49.433 --> 01:09:52.533
with this monumental
piece of news might be...

1601
01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:53.567
insensitive?

1602
01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:55.066
Oh. come on.
you know kids today.

1603
01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.200
They never answer their phones.

1604
01:09:56.333 --> 01:09:57.800
She's really upset. James.

1605
01:09:57.934 --> 01:09:58.967
She's over-reacting!

1606
01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.300
That's what
11-year-old girls do.

1607
01:10:00.433 --> 01:10:01.266
She's 13.

1608
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.433
Okay. you know what I mean.

1609
01:10:02.567 --> 01:10:04.100
Are you even thinking
about her at all?

1610
01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:06.400
What this means to.
and for. her?

1611
01:10:06.533 --> 01:10:08.533
You should've called her.
talked to her before y--

1612
01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:09.400
Okay. you know what?
We're not--

1613
01:10:09.533 --> 01:10:10.533
We're not doing this. okay?

1614
01:10:10.667 --> 01:10:12.100
I'm not gonna argue
with you about this.

1615
01:10:12.233 --> 01:10:13.266
This is happening. okay?

1616
01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.233
So just get her on that plane.
like I asked you.

1617
01:10:15.367 --> 01:10:16.266
My office will send

1618
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.800
all the info.

1619
01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:32.567
I can't believe
he's doing this.

1620
01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:33.633
Sometimes.

1621
01:10:33.767 --> 01:10:35.934
people get caught up
in their own lives

1622
01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:38.967
and they don't think about
how their actions affect others.

1623
01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.900
Not "people". Dad.

1624
01:10:42.033 --> 01:10:43.900
I know. He could've
handled this better.

1625
01:10:45.433 --> 01:10:46.900
It's just awful.

1626
01:10:47.033 --> 01:10:49.033
I was hoping...

1627
01:10:50.233 --> 01:10:51.200
Hoping what?

1628
01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.533
That when you came back
to New York.

1629
01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:57.400
Dad would see you and figure
it's really you he loves.

1630
01:10:57.533 --> 01:10:59.567
Oh. Erin. no.

1631
01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:02.200
Your father and I aren't
getting back together.

1632
01:11:02.333 --> 01:11:03.934
But you love each other.

1633
01:11:04.066 --> 01:11:06.767
We did. but things change
between people.

1634
01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.433
and they did
with your father and me.

1635
01:11:09.567 --> 01:11:13.500
But one thing never changed.
and never will...

1636
01:11:13.633 --> 01:11:15.400
we both love you.

1637
01:11:16.767 --> 01:11:18.934
All I want
is for us to be a family.

1638
01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.300
I know.
Erin. we are family.

1639
01:11:21.433 --> 01:11:23.533
You and I
will always be family.

1640
01:11:23.667 --> 01:11:25.433
Can't I stay here with you?

1641
01:11:25.567 --> 01:11:27.767
I really love it here.

1642
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.367
And Bethany doesn't want me!

1643
01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.200
Her and Dad will send me
off to boarding school.

1644
01:11:31.333 --> 01:11:32.934
It's not my decision to make.

1645
01:11:33.066 --> 01:11:35.166
I don't want Dad and Bethany
to get married!

1646
01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:37.100
Bethany couldn't care less
about me.

1647
01:11:37.233 --> 01:11:40.400
To her.
I'm just a complication.

1648
01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:43.400
To all of you!

1649
01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:56.133
Erin?

1650
01:11:57.934 --> 01:11:59.533
I made you something to eat.

1651
01:12:02.633 --> 01:12:04.100
Erin?

1652
01:12:04.233 --> 01:12:06.266
I'm not hungry!

1653
01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:10.000
Honey. are you okay?

1654
01:12:10.133 --> 01:12:13.000
I'm fine.

1655
01:12:13.133 --> 01:12:15.100
I'll put your plate
in the fridge.

1656
01:12:15.233 --> 01:12:17.266
if you're hungry later.

1657
01:12:40.567 --> 01:12:43.033
Boone. Hi.

1658
01:12:43.166 --> 01:12:45.433
The boys talked me into
making cookies for dessert

1659
01:12:45.567 --> 01:12:48.000
so I thought you and Erin
would like the overflow.

1660
01:12:48.133 --> 01:12:51.100
How. um...
how thoughtful.

1661
01:12:52.133 --> 01:12:54.834
You. uh...
packing up your stuff?

1662
01:13:02.367 --> 01:13:04.633
I am so sorry. but...

1663
01:13:04.767 --> 01:13:06.000
I'm leaving.

1664
01:13:07.567 --> 01:13:09.300
What do you mean. leaving?

1665
01:13:09.433 --> 01:13:11.066
I'm going back to New York.

1666
01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.834
When?

1667
01:13:12.967 --> 01:13:14.667
Tomorrow.
if I can get it together.

1668
01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:16.233
Well. when did you decide that?

1669
01:13:16.367 --> 01:13:17.967
I'm still deciding.

1670
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.066
Things are just happening
so fast.

1671
01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.000
Well. what kind of things?

1672
01:13:22.133 --> 01:13:25.400
Erin has to go back to New York
to face some big life changes.

1673
01:13:25.533 --> 01:13:27.500
I don't want her
to deal with them on her own.

1674
01:13:27.633 --> 01:13:28.767
I want to be there for her.

1675
01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.633
Were you even gonna bother
telling me?

1676
01:13:30.767 --> 01:13:32.333
Of course.
I was gonna tell you.

1677
01:13:32.467 --> 01:13:34.333
I-I haven't even told Erin yet.

1678
01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.100
I just decided.

1679
01:13:37.233 --> 01:13:41.066
Like I said. I--
things are happening so fast.

1680
01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.266
You said you were scared.
I just...

1681
01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.433
I didn't think
you were this scared.

1682
01:13:45.567 --> 01:13:46.834
This isn't about us. Boone.

1683
01:13:46.967 --> 01:13:50.200
Well. it doesn't look like
there is an "us". does it?

1684
01:13:50.333 --> 01:13:52.500
Don't say that.

1685
01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.300
I gotta get back to the boys.

1686
01:13:55.433 --> 01:13:56.967
I'll-- I'll see you later.

1687
01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.300
Boone. please.
Let's talk about this.

1688
01:14:00.734 --> 01:14:02.233
Boone?

1689
01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:33.934
Rise and shine. sweetie!

1690
01:14:34.066 --> 01:14:35.834
Breakfast in 10!

1691
01:14:51.767 --> 01:14:53.233
Erin?

1692
01:14:53.367 --> 01:14:55.300
-
- Erin. honey?

1693
01:15:05.266 --> 01:15:07.066
Erin?

1694
01:15:10.934 --> 01:15:12.800
Erin?

1695
01:15:15.834 --> 01:15:18.000
Hey. It's Erin.
Leave a message.

1696
01:15:18.133 --> 01:15:21.300
Erin. it's me.
Where are you?

1697
01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:23.934
Call me.

1698
01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:27.266
- Boone.
- Tara.

1699
01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.300
Morning. Tara.

1700
01:15:28.433 --> 01:15:29.700
Erin's gone.
I think she ran away.

1701
01:15:29.834 --> 01:15:31.133
I looked everywhere.

1702
01:15:31.266 --> 01:15:32.500
and she's not
picking up her phone.

1703
01:15:32.633 --> 01:15:33.934
What makes you think
she ran away?

1704
01:15:34.066 --> 01:15:35.166
The stuff with her dad
last night.

1705
01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:36.300
She was really upset.

1706
01:15:36.433 --> 01:15:37.967
I checked all over
and she's gone.

1707
01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:38.934
Okay. tell you what.

1708
01:15:39.066 --> 01:15:41.033
You drive north.
I'll drive south.

1709
01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:43.033
and we'll see find her. okay?

1710
01:15:43.166 --> 01:15:43.934
- Okay.
- All right.

1711
01:15:44.066 --> 01:15:44.967
You come with me. buddy.

1712
01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.433
Hey. Griff.
have you seen Erin?

1713
01:15:46.567 --> 01:15:47.500
No. why?

1714
01:15:47.633 --> 01:15:48.700
She's missing.

1715
01:15:48.834 --> 01:15:51.166
I was just down at the docks
and the boat's not there.

1716
01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.367
The boat's not there?

1717
01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.100
Yeah. I was gonna go fishing.
but it's gone.

1718
01:15:54.233 --> 01:15:55.767
Does she know how to row?

1719
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:58.200
- No!
- Okay. come on! Let's go!

1720
01:16:02.567 --> 01:16:04.333
Erin!

1721
01:16:04.467 --> 01:16:06.166
Erin!

1722
01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.500
Erin!

1723
01:16:07.633 --> 01:16:09.667
Erin! Where are you?

1724
01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.934
Erin!

1725
01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:12.266
Erin...

1726
01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.266
- Give you a hand.
- Thank you.

1727
01:16:18.734 --> 01:16:20.100
Erin!

1728
01:16:22.166 --> 01:16:23.333
Erin!

1729
01:16:28.567 --> 01:16:29.934
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1730
01:16:31.233 --> 01:16:32.467
There's the boat.

1731
01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.633
Tara. take the kids
down that way--

1732
01:16:34.767 --> 01:16:35.834
there's a safer route down.

1733
01:16:35.967 --> 01:16:38.133
I'm gonna go this way.
I'll meet you there. okay?

1734
01:16:50.367 --> 01:16:52.200
Boone?

1735
01:16:54.533 --> 01:16:55.500
Erin.

1736
01:16:57.367 --> 01:16:58.433
Mom!

1737
01:16:58.567 --> 01:17:00.100
There she is!

1738
01:17:01.133 --> 01:17:02.000
Mom!

1739
01:17:02.934 --> 01:17:04.900
Erin! You okay?

1740
01:17:05.033 --> 01:17:06.233
You okay?

1741
01:17:06.367 --> 01:17:07.433
I think so.

1742
01:17:07.567 --> 01:17:08.667
Okay. I'm gonna
try and get you up.

1743
01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.300
Nice and easy...
there you go. I gotcha.

1744
01:17:10.433 --> 01:17:13.266
Gonna pass you up
to your mother. okay?

1745
01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.467
You got her?

1746
01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.033
Yeah.

1747
01:17:16.166 --> 01:17:18.133
- Mom.
- It's okay. I got you.

1748
01:17:18.266 --> 01:17:20.433
I got you. Okay?

1749
01:17:20.567 --> 01:17:21.934
You all right? Okay.

1750
01:17:28.633 --> 01:17:31.066
Am I gonna get arrested?

1751
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.300
Arrested?

1752
01:17:32.433 --> 01:17:34.166
For stealing the boat.

1753
01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:36.433
Oh. No. Of course not.

1754
01:17:36.567 --> 01:17:38.500
Oh. I never said
I wasn't gonna arrest her.

1755
01:17:38.633 --> 01:17:41.166
I should arrest you
for being so irresponsible.

1756
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.800
And what in the world
were you thinking?

1757
01:17:43.934 --> 01:17:45.700
The map on my phone.

1758
01:17:45.834 --> 01:17:48.500
I thought the river
could take me far enough away

1759
01:17:48.633 --> 01:17:50.200
so Dad couldn't find me.

1760
01:17:52.533 --> 01:17:53.767
Please. don't be mad.

1761
01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.567
Oh. baby. I'm not mad.
I'm not mad.

1762
01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.667
I'm just so grateful
you're okay.

1763
01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:00.233
I'm so sorry.

1764
01:18:00.367 --> 01:18:01.433
It's okay.

1765
01:18:14.266 --> 01:18:15.967
Boone.

1766
01:18:18.333 --> 01:18:19.500
Thank you.

1767
01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.967
Tara.

1768
01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:13.333
James.

1769
01:19:13.467 --> 01:19:16.100
Are you calling to confirm
Erin's travel arrangements?

1770
01:19:16.233 --> 01:19:18.967
No. I'm calling to let you know
she's staying here with me.

1771
01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:20.266
At least. for now.

1772
01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.266
What?

1773
01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.066
She was so determined

1774
01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.200
not to go back to New York.

1775
01:19:24.333 --> 01:19:25.400
that she ran away this morning.

1776
01:19:25.533 --> 01:19:26.767
She almost drowned.

1777
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:28.633
Oh. come on.
you can't be serious.

1778
01:19:28.767 --> 01:19:31.333
Your daughter
is in a world of pain.

1779
01:19:31.467 --> 01:19:33.900
Right now. what she needs
more than anything

1780
01:19:34.033 --> 01:19:35.633
is a parent
who's gonna love her.

1781
01:19:35.767 --> 01:19:36.934
nurture her.

1782
01:19:37.066 --> 01:19:38.100
catch her when she stumbles.

1783
01:19:38.233 --> 01:19:41.300
and try to keep her
from stumbling at all.

1784
01:19:41.433 --> 01:19:43.433
Yeah. well. she's only got
one parent. Tara.

1785
01:19:43.567 --> 01:19:44.934
No. She has me.

1786
01:19:45.066 --> 01:19:46.867
and I'm not sending her
back to you.

1787
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:47.967
not in the state she's in.

1788
01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.100
Yeah. well.
that's not your choice to make.

1789
01:19:49.233 --> 01:19:50.100
You're not her mother.

1790
01:19:50.233 --> 01:19:51.800
Yes. I am...

1791
01:19:51.934 --> 01:19:53.367
in every way that counts.

1792
01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:54.600
She better be on that plane!

1793
01:19:54.734 --> 01:19:55.734
She won't be.

1794
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.433
If you want
your daughter back. James.

1795
01:19:59.567 --> 01:20:01.600
learn how to love her.

1796
01:20:01.734 --> 01:20:03.667
She so desperately
wants you to.

1797
01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:04.867
I do love her!

1798
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:05.967
Of course. I love her.

1799
01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:07.100
She doesn't know that.

1800
01:20:08.233 --> 01:20:09.200
How could she not?

1801
01:20:09.333 --> 01:20:10.734
I give--
I give her everything she wants.

1802
01:20:10.867 --> 01:20:12.633
Oh. James.

1803
01:20:12.767 --> 01:20:15.633
You're so smart. yet...

1804
01:20:15.767 --> 01:20:17.900
so blind.

1805
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.367
Did she really almost drown?

1806
01:20:21.767 --> 01:20:23.233
Yes.

1807
01:20:23.367 --> 01:20:25.633
That's...

1808
01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:28.367
That's awful. I...

1809
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:31.500
She needs some time. James.

1810
01:20:32.567 --> 01:20:35.133
And I don't expect you
to come and get her.

1811
01:20:35.266 --> 01:20:41.700
But. for right now.
just let me take care of Erin.

1812
01:20:42.734 --> 01:20:44.333
Please?

1813
01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.500
Okay.

1814
01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:47.500
Thank you.

1815
01:20:47.633 --> 01:20:49.533
No. Thank you.

1816
01:20:49.667 --> 01:20:51.100
And hey...

1817
01:20:51.233 --> 01:20:52.834
tell Erin that I love her.

1818
01:20:52.967 --> 01:20:55.700
You can tell her that. James.

1819
01:20:56.934 --> 01:20:59.133
I will.

1820
01:20:59.266 --> 01:21:00.500
Bye.

1821
01:21:15.734 --> 01:21:17.467
- Hey.
- Hi.

1822
01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:21.700
You're still here.

1823
01:21:21.834 --> 01:21:23.700
I am.

1824
01:21:23.834 --> 01:21:26.233
Uh. forgive the regift.

1825
01:21:28.767 --> 01:21:31.166
I meant what I said. Boone.

1826
01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:32.867
I'm scared to death

1827
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.367
to get into
a relationship again.

1828
01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:36.800
but not if it's with you.

1829
01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:42.233
If I let this pass me by.

1830
01:21:42.367 --> 01:21:44.333
I'm gonna regret it
for the rest of my life.

1831
01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:49.633
Well. I...
I do appreciate that.

1832
01:21:49.767 --> 01:21:51.600
but it's gonna be
awfully hard to do.

1833
01:21:51.734 --> 01:21:53.100
2.000 miles away.

1834
01:21:55.166 --> 01:21:56.967
I know.

1835
01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.867
A long-distance romance...

1836
01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.700
that's a...

1837
01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:03.233
huge complication.

1838
01:22:03.367 --> 01:22:04.900
It's a...

1839
01:22:05.033 --> 01:22:06.266
it's a pretty big one.

1840
01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.300
Which. um...

1841
01:22:09.367 --> 01:22:10.900
...is why I'm staying.

1842
01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:13.600
You are?

1843
01:22:13.734 --> 01:22:15.100
I'm taking a job here.

1844
01:22:15.233 --> 01:22:17.200
Um...
I might be teaching your boys.

1845
01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:18.266
Really?

1846
01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.367
They would love that.

1847
01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:21.734
But...

1848
01:22:21.867 --> 01:22:23.100
I mean. what about Erin?

1849
01:22:23.233 --> 01:22:24.433
Doesn't she need you
in New York?

1850
01:22:24.567 --> 01:22:25.567
She's staying. too.

1851
01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.800
Until James comes to his senses

1852
01:22:27.934 --> 01:22:30.400
and becomes the father
that she needs him to be.

1853
01:22:30.533 --> 01:22:31.934
What if that doesn't happen?

1854
01:22:32.066 --> 01:22:33.266
Then I'll be one happy mom.

1855
01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.867
Well. you're a pretty good mom.

1856
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.667
You're a pretty good dad.

1857
01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.767
Yeah. I try.

1858
01:22:39.834 --> 01:22:41.934
And that's why you are.

1859
01:22:42.066 --> 01:22:44.400
Thank you.

1860
01:22:44.533 --> 01:22:46.467
You've...

1861
01:22:47.533 --> 01:22:50.166
...restored my faith
in so many things.

1862
01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:53.767
Most importantly...

1863
01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:55.033
in this.

1864
01:22:57.533 --> 01:22:58.533
Game on!

1865
01:23:00.667 --> 01:23:01.734
Where are you going?

1866
01:23:01.867 --> 01:23:03.000
Soccer game?

1867
01:23:03.133 --> 01:23:05.000
Are we gonna do this again?
Really?

1868
01:23:05.133 --> 01:23:06.100
Here we go!

1869
01:23:06.233 --> 01:23:07.400
Remember what happened
last time we did this.

1870
01:23:07.533 --> 01:23:09.166
don't you?

1871
01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:10.667
Huh?

1872
01:23:11.934 --> 01:23:14.000
Not so fast. cowboy.

1873
01:23:14.133 --> 01:23:18.100
♪ What if we lay it on the line
this time ♪

1874
01:23:18.233 --> 01:23:21.000
♪ Ain't that what we deserve?

1875
01:23:21.133 --> 01:23:25.133

1876
01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:26.500

Come back here.

♪ What if I stay?

1879
01:23:35.767 --> 01:23:38.300
