A bust gone horribly wrong.
An undercover officer accidentally shot

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:19.575
more than a half dozen times.

5
00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:24.325
Put your hands where I can see them.
Good. Good.

6
00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:28.700
Shortly after. you can hear an officer
as he realizes

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.900
he shot the colleague who was undercover.

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.975

with AK-47.

12
00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:43.400
In order to be a true undercover officer.

13
00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:46.900
one must divorce himself
from who he truly is.

14
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:54.175
What role will be played next?
No gun. no badge.

15
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.425
Only the skin and will to live.

16
00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.075
While law enforcement agencies
prefer to use undercover officers

17
00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:08.750
that have grown up in these communities.
this can prove to be good or bad.

18
00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:13.725
Charging a car for a parking problem.

19
00:01:18.325 --> 00:01:20.575

20
00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:24.650
.

21
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.800
That's what it takes. Q.
You won the lottery when you met me.

22
00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:32.900
I've been out here doing big things
and go straight to the top.

23
00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:40.575
You still ain't told me
what we doing here. Hector.

24
00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:43.375
You said it was important.
so I dropped everything.

25
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.475
You could've saved this "I have a dream"
speech for the phone. dawg.

26
00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:49.275
This is it.
The break we've been waiting for.

27
00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.875
Nothing. I mean nothing will be the same
after this.

28
00:01:52.525 --> 00:01:55.625
We're about to meet
with Sir Ruthless himself.

29
00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:57.925
We can't let that pass up.

30
00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:03.125
You're serious. ain't you? I can't believe
I'm letting you convince me.

31
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.650
I told you this was big.

32
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.075
Have you lost your damn mind?

33
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.550
We got a meeting set up with Peter Vega.
It took seven months to get that.

34
00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:15.725
--
-Q. Q. Q. quit thinking so small.

35
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.000
Sir Ruthless is leaving the States.
The feds are on him.

36
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.150
He's out low on his shit.
What else you want to do?

37
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.325
Why don't we go for it?

38
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.400

Hey. Rufus.
I like what you've done with the place.

41
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.575
It's real tidy up here.
Looks like how you like it.

42
00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:53.050
-Yo. yo. Who's this?
-He's my brother.

43
00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:57.075
-Are you alone. Rufus?

44
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:05.475
-We good. come on.

45
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.175
-We're all friends here. Rufus.
- Friends?

46
00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.025
Man. check this out.
I ain't got no friends.

47

Freeze--

54
00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:07.175
Hey. I'm--

55
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.275
Captain. you want to see this.

56
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.725
-What have we got here?
-GSW to the chest times three.

57
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.925
All right. on my count.

58
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.475
One. two. three. roll.

59
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.450

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.050
-We've got to get him out now.
- STAT. X-ray STAT.

61
00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:04.975
BP 80 over 40. Come on. Come on.

62
00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:42.625
Disappointed.
Very. very disappointed.

63
00:07:45.075 --> 00:07:47.175
I have the police on my payroll.

64
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.200
It was just a matter of time before
I found out you were the informer.

65
00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:56.375
I never said anything about you. Vega.
I swear.

66
00:07:57.225 --> 00:07:58.875
They found out about you.

67
00:07:59.075 --> 00:08:01.750
It was just a matter of time
before they found out about me.

68
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.925
After everything I've done for you.
for your daughter. .

69
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.000
The cops said they would take
my daughter to foster care

70
00:08:08.675 --> 00:08:12.300
and take my mama's house.
I didn't know what else to do.

71
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.775
Been with you for five years. Vega.

72
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.250
There must be some kind of mistake.

73
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.675
You know me.

74
00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.400
I can't vouch for these two. but
I never said anything to the police.

75
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.375
Samantha.

76
00:08:34.475 --> 00:08:36.200
what do you have to say for yourself?

77
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.900
I don't know what you want me to say.

78
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.375
What do you have to say for yourself?

79
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:46.375
You knew it was only a matter of time
before the cops closed in on you.

80
00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:48.350
I'm not no rat.

81
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.050
For the last time.
I didn't talk to the police.

82
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.475
Why do y'all talk about the police
like they're good guys?

83
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.525
There are no good guys.
Ask anyone.

84
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.725
Breonna Taylor. George Floyd.
Everyone's hands are stained with blood.

85
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.400
It was like that before me. and
it's going to be that way when I'm gone.

86
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.400
Vega. I don't know where
you're getting your information from.

87
00:09:12.725 --> 00:09:16.575
I never said anything to the police.
Please. just make a call.

88
00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:18.775
Brad.

89
00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:21.650
you know I have the police
under my payroll. right?

90
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.675
The same guy who flipped you.
that's the same guy who told me it was you.

91
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.075
He's the head the head
of narcotic division. Mr. Jackson.

92
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.000
We live in a dangerous world.

93
00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:32.975
These are dangerous times.

94
00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:37.275
You played the game. got caught cheating.

95
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.875
Now. you pay the consequences.

96
00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:51.050
First of all. I'd like to thank Brad.

97
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.575
Samantha. Rachel.
for helping law enforcement out.

98
00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.300
Unfortunately.
we no longer need your services.

99
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.150
-You said you would help me.
-Oh. I'm going to help you.

100
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.000
I'm going to check in on your
daughter every now and again.

101
00:10:07.475 --> 00:10:09.475
but she doesn't need a junkie
as a mother.

102
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.550
-You're good for nothing. dick.
-Watch yourself.

103
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.975
shot.

104
00:10:23.325 --> 00:10:26.050
You watch your mouth. junkie.

105
00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:33.100
shot.

106
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.250
It's with a heavy heart.
but I have to say goodbye.

107
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.500
Vega. you want to change
anything that we planned?

108
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.450
Oh. yes. we are.
We're changing everything.

109
00:11:07.725 --> 00:11:09.950
We're not taking nothing for granted.

110
00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:21.200
Look. I smacked dude so hard.

111
00:11:21.275 --> 00:11:24.825
I thought he was going to shoot me.
Kevin already know I don't play.

112
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.825
-All he do is put his gun down and walk out.
-You're going to get yourself killed.

113
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.625
Everybody know I don't play.

114
00:11:32.675 --> 00:11:35.550
I will never let nobody disrespect me.

115
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.075
Y'all know that.
What you shaking your head for?

116
00:11:42.425 --> 00:11:44.825
I don't get you sometimes. Candy.

117
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.675
You ain't got to be damn hard
all the time.

118
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:52.150
Lighten up.
Take it easy. For real.

119
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.975
Yo. she's right though.
I understand what she's saying.

120
00:11:57.575 --> 00:12:00.250
I'm just hardcore.

121
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:07.125
I didn't choose this thug life.
This thug life chose me.

122
00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.900
Yes. you're right. Red.
You the original OG.

123
00:12:17.175 --> 00:12:21.800
Yo Candy. don't forget to invite Tom.

124
00:12:21.975 --> 00:12:25.000
You know Tom ain't coming
all the way over here for no party.

125
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.525
Hold on. I thought this was my party?
I can invite whoever I want to.

126
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.025
-Red. you can invite Tom. That's okay.
-Yo. thank you.

127
00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:42.475
Can I throw a little hardcore
at the lifestyle?

128
00:12:45.025 --> 00:12:48.125
Red. you mean a freestyle?

129
00:12:49.375 --> 00:12:53.825
Girl. you crazy.
Girl. you silly. man.

130
00:12:54.675 --> 00:12:56.950
What. you Lil Wayne now?

131
00:13:00.325 --> 00:13:02.650
Yo. don't hate on my swag.

132
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.600
Come on. y'all.
Come on.

133
00:13:07.925 --> 00:13:09.700
Can we get back to my party?

134
00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:12.750
We only got 15 names on this list.

135
00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:16.400
I know we got to be missing somebody.
We have got to think.

136
00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:24.925
Anthony.
I'm going to invite Anthony.

137
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.700
Anthony?

138
00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:31.975
You know I don't like that cat.
Two-faced snake.

139
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.375
Candy. you know how I couldn't have birthday
parties at that foster home I was in.

140
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.150
I just want to have a good time
and enjoy my party.

141
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.650
It's going to be an epic night.

142
00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.400
Promise me. Candy. that
you will not act up at my party?

143
00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:50.275
Yo. this is going to be
the best party ever.

144
00:13:50.825 --> 00:13:53.500
-Yes. girl. yes.
-I can't wait.

145
00:13:54.275 --> 00:13:58.150
-All the single ladies out.
-Candy. look.

146
00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.225
I don't need you scaring
everybody off at the party.

147
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.625
-I need you to understand that. You know.
-What?

148
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.775
Everybody ain't gay?
I know that.

149
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.650
I'm just trying to find my soulmate.

150
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.875
What's wrong with that?
I just want some love too.

151
00:14:16.475 --> 00:14:19.700
That's all.
Can I kick and have some fun?

152
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.375
I wish I had a soulmate.

153
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:31.100
It's like my soul is in these streets.

154
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.125
That's why I'm so hood.
I'm jealous of you two.

155
00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:38.375
Look. Red.

156
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.325
I can understand you being jealous of me.

157
00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:43.175
You know what I'm saying?

158
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.050
Heaven. she ain't had a dude
since like the eighth grade.

159
00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:51.775
Whoa. wait.

160
00:14:53.075 --> 00:14:55.725
Now y'all got jokes.
Don't be coming for me.

161
00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.500
I can get a man.
I just don't want a man.

162
00:15:00.325 --> 00:15:03.925
With everything I got going on.
just imagine.

163
00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:07.250
Papa Vega. can you just think
of what he would do?

164
00:15:08.075 --> 00:15:10.525
That's just too much drama.
I ain't got that type of time.

165
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.050
That's for real right there.

166
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:18.000
He'd be dead. Yo.
Us black sisters got to stay strong.

167
00:15:18.825 --> 00:15:21.700
You got that right.

168
00:15:23.225 --> 00:15:27.325
First off. I'm going to say this.
You need a man. all right?

169
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:32.050
What?
You're going to stay single your whole life

170
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.950
just because you're afraid that
your dad going to kill your dude?

171
00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:39.975
Look. this party is your chance.

172
00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.025
You're going to find you a man.

173
00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:44.675
I'm going to get me my soulmate.

174
00:15:47.175 --> 00:15:50.650
Girl. I don't know
what you're going to do.

175
00:15:53.175 --> 00:15:55.150
I'm going to bust my lifestyle.

176
00:15:56.425 --> 00:15:58.100
-Bust the lifestyle.
-What you doing?

177
00:15:58.175 --> 00:16:00.250
Bust the lifestyle.
Bus the lifestyle.

178
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.900
That's not what I'm asking.
Officer Rogers.

179
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.325
I realize this could be uncomfortable.

180
00:16:22.325 --> 00:16:26.125
I'm not uncomfortable.
I'm good. I'm real comfortable.

181
00:16:27.625 --> 00:16:31.050
I took my physical.
I'm just ready to get back to work.

182
00:16:35.675 --> 00:16:37.625
Are you in a relationship at the moment?

183
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:43.175
-No. not at all.
-I've looked over your file.

184
00:16:44.425 --> 00:16:49.950
No friends. no close family.
I see you were married for two years.

185
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.375
-Don't remind me.
-Are you two on good terms?

186
00:16:59.775 --> 00:17:02.675
No. She had a master's degree.

187
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.900
What did she get a master's degree in?

188
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.050
She only got a master's degree
in getting on my damn nerves.

189
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.200
I had a dream I was in hell.
like I was really in hell.

190
00:17:11.425 --> 00:17:14.150
There was fire around. and when I woke up.

191
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.975
-Shelly was staring directly at me.
-I'm not understanding.

192
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.025
What's not to understand?

193
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.900
I just told you.
I had a nightmare I was in hell.

194
00:17:25.675 --> 00:17:29.550
When I woke up.
Shelly was staring directly at me.

195
00:17:31.525 --> 00:17:35.300
Officer Rogers. I need you to be serious.

196
00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.675
I take the devil real serious.
You should go to church sometimes.

197
00:17:42.525 --> 00:17:43.850
What was your childhood like?

198
00:17:44.525 --> 00:17:48.825
I'm originally from Akron;
me and my boy. LB. that is.

199
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:54.175
We both wanted to be superheroes.

200
00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:57.400
We both wanted to change the world.

201
00:18:00.125 --> 00:18:03.125
No drugs in my city.
Bang.

202
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.975
When I'm a cop. the streets are
going to be so clean. you can eat off them.

203
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.375
"Back. I said. back the heck up."

204
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.950
Man. I wish your dad wouldn't have
took you to see Bad Boys.

205
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.825
-You ain't no Will Smith.
-You ain't no Magic Johnson.

206
00:18:19.175 --> 00:18:21.750
I'm going to be better than Magic Johnson.

207
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.350
I'm going to Saint Vincent.
Saint Mary High School.

208
00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:28.125
Maybe I should skip college
and go straight to the NBA.

209
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.525
I could be the number one pick
for the Cleveland Cavaliers.

210
00:18:31.675 --> 00:18:34.000
-You never know.
-The Cav?

211
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.500
You should go to the Lakers.

212
00:18:40.625 --> 00:18:45.800
Back in 1995. things were simple.

213
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.275
We used to listen to that one song.
Don't take it Per--

214
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.375
You know. the Monica song?

215
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.200
Me and him would argue which one
of us was going to fall in love with her.

216
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.150
Those were the days.

217
00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:02.175
Are you still in contact
with your childhood friend?

218
00:19:02.825 --> 00:19:04.650
Oh. yes.
Closest thing in the family.

219
00:19:06.275 --> 00:19:09.475
When was the last time
you were in a relationship?

220
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.875
I was in a relationship
before my last assignment.

221
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.000
She was bad news.

222
00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:19.225
Iesha. the girl was off the hook.

223
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.200
I'm talking paranormal activity.
The Exorcist.

224
00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:28.750
The Shining. hell even Scooby-Doo.

225
00:19:28.925 --> 00:19:31.475
It was terrible.
We dated for two years.

226
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.400
Two years too long.

227
00:19:34.525 --> 00:19:38.075
I'm sorry. Excuse me for a moment.

228
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:45.475
Yes. this is her.
Yes. he's in my office.

229
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:51.675
You're going to see him tomorrow?
Okay. I'll let him know.

230
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.500
Yes. we're almost done.
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

231
00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:02.150
That was Captain Hawkins.

232
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.925
She wants to see you in her office
tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.

233
00:20:06.925 --> 00:20:13.475
I am going to clear you
for active duty reluctantly.

234
00:20:17.575 --> 00:20:21.025
but I must remind you.
we are scheduled for two more sessions.

235
00:20:21.725 --> 00:20:24.550
All things considered. you're doing well.

236
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.475
I'll see you next week.

237
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.100
Can I ask you a question. Dr. McCabe?

238
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.725
-What's that?
-Just be honest with me.

239
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.525
Do I look like Will Smith?

240
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.525
Goodbye. Rogers.

241
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.250
Oh. I get it.
You have to act like you don't see it.

242
00:20:49.525 --> 00:20:52.175
Well. you should watch I. Robot.
I'm sure you'll see it.

243
00:20:53.425 --> 00:20:57.050
By the way. I was going to say
you look like Halle Berry.

244
00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.000
but you don't.
Not at all.

245
00:21:02.525 --> 00:21:04.225
See you next week. doc.

246
00:21:32.975 --> 00:21:34.125
Hey.

247
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.425
It's me.

248
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.275
Iesha. what are you doing?

249
00:21:46.425 --> 00:21:48.350
Man. it's been almost
a year since I've seen you.

250
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.700
Well. I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd stop by

251
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.850
and see what you're up to people?

252
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.625
You're just in the neighborhood?

253
00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.900
Yes. but what are you doing here?

254
00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:59.475
You lucky I didn't get a restraining order
put on you first time.

255
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.550
You need to stay away
from me for real. for real.

256
00:22:05.225 --> 00:22:08.375
-I see you're still upset.
-You see I'm still upset?

257
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.350
Hell yes. I'm upset.

258
00:22:13.075 --> 00:22:16.225
You slashed my mom's tires
and broke my 65-inch TV.

259
00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:19.700
-Yes. I'm upset.
-Baby. I'm sorry.

260
00:22:20.275 --> 00:22:23.000
There's literally nothing I could do
to make up for those things.

261
00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.650
I can tell you I'm better now.

262
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.300
-You're better now?
-Yes.

263
00:22:28.975 --> 00:22:32.725
Listen. it was good seeing you and all.
but I got to go.

264
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.300
Please. listen.
Just hear me out.

265
00:22:37.475 --> 00:22:39.675
I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II.

266
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.550
I didn't know there are stages
to this thing.

267
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.450
That explains the mood swings.
the craziness.

268
00:22:48.925 --> 00:22:50.625
We were together for two years.

269
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.500
It was the best two years of my life.

270
00:22:55.675 --> 00:22:59.200
I just want us.
I want you.

271
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.475
-You want us?
-Yes.

272
00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.150
There is no us.
Look. I don't want to be that guy.

273
00:23:12.325 --> 00:23:13.700
I hate you. Iesha.

274
00:23:14.475 --> 00:23:17.750
I've never hated anyone in my life.
but I really hate you.

275
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:21.125
You put through way too much.

276
00:23:21.675 --> 00:23:26.350
Whatever you going through.
schizophrenia. COVID.

277
00:23:28.225 --> 00:23:32.175
bipolar. you need
to deal with your issues.

278
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.800
I'm going to tell you this one time only.

279
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.950
You need to stay away from me before
I really get a restraining order put on you.

280
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.250
You understand me?

281
00:23:56.125 --> 00:24:00.200
Hello. Yes.

282
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.525
You wanted to see me. Captain?

283
00:24:20.575 --> 00:24:24.025
Will wait no considered; more.
Give me a second.

284
00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.000
Yes. I understand.

285
00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.000
If we could touch base a little bit later.
that'd be great.

286
00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.325
Yes. Okay.
All right. Thank you.

287
00:24:34.425 --> 00:24:37.875
Sorry. I'm late.
I had some loose ends I had to tie up.

288
00:24:38.025 --> 00:24:40.075
You're fine.
Come on in.

289
00:24:43.975 --> 00:24:46.150
How are you doing. Rogers?

290
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.500
I'll know as soon as we done
with this meeting.

291
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.000
Well. we do have an assignment for you.
This is Agent Jackson.

292
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.350
He's been running point
on the Peter Vega case.

293
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.800
In the next two months. we believe Vega is
going to take his operation out of the state.

294
00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:04.925
Now if that happens.
we're going to be left in the dark

295
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.250
and have to start all over from scratch.

296
00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.950
As luck would have it. I think
we may have found another way in.

297
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:17.000
We have four informants on the case.
three which were killed.

298
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.575
One survived. Anthony Allen.

299
00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:25.325
We understand that the two of you
went to high school together.

300
00:25:29.125 --> 00:25:31.150
This is your target.

301
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:37.375
One Samantha Owens. aka Heaven.

302
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.025
In and out of foster care.

303
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.025
No real criminal record as of yet.

304
00:25:46.625 --> 00:25:51.900
Next. That right there is Eve Owens.

305
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.275
aka Candy.

306
00:25:56.425 --> 00:25:58.450
24 and hardcore.

307
00:25:58.925 --> 00:26:03.125
She's got a rap sheet longer than
any politician you will ever know.

308
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.200
Assault and battery. burglary.

309
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.500
You name it. this one has done it.

310
00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.675
Sherry Westwood. aka Red.

311
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.675
This girl doesn't even have a clue.
Her family is what you would call affluent.

312
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.625
Put in the best schools.
best programs. best of everything.

313
00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:29.575
They let her hang around.

314
00:26:32.325 --> 00:26:34.725
Vega had a daughter. Stephanie Vega.

315
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.725
She was friends with Heaven.
There was a drive-by shooting.

316
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.850
Stephanie was killed.
Heaven was wounded.

317
00:26:43.975 --> 00:26:49.225
Vega felt so bad that he cares
for Heaven as if it were his own daughter.

318
00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:52.725
What I need you to do
is to get close to Heaven.

319
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:55.750
Find out what you can about Vega.
Don't push.

320
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.850
Just get information.

321
00:26:58.225 --> 00:27:00.500
Anthony is going to meet you tomorrow.

322
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:01.875
Anthony Allen?

323
00:27:02.575 --> 00:27:05.375
No. no. no. hell no.

324
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:07.725
I can't take him serious.

325
00:27:08.275 --> 00:27:11.100
He'll mess around and get himself killed
and get me killed.

326
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.775
Look. I know it's asking a lot.
I know Anthony can't be trusted.

327
00:27:16.775 --> 00:27:20.350
It's the only viable solution
that we have right now.

328
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.000
Look. Anthony will play ball.

329
00:27:23.175 --> 00:27:26.975
He's looking at five years right now
for possession with intent to sell.

330
00:27:28.025 --> 00:27:32.725
His mission right now is to keep Anthony
out of a maximum security prison.

331
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:38.125
Bottom line. are you ready for this?
If you're not ready--

332
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.325
-Just give me like a week
so I can get back in the swing of things.

333
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.375
You've got two hours.

334
00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:49.050
We're giving you $20.000 to flush around
so you can get close to people.

335
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.700
In the meantime.
Heaven's planning a birthday party.

336
00:27:53.425 --> 00:27:55.950
You make sure to buy her something nice.

337
00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.100
Before you go.

338
00:28:01.725 --> 00:28:05.300
just get all the information
of all the players involved here.

339
00:28:05.425 --> 00:28:06.900
You're going to need that.

340
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.500
We're good.

341
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.225
Sergeant. Captain. honest question.

342
00:28:23.575 --> 00:28:26.350
You gave me this mission because
I look like Will Smith. didn't you?

343
00:28:30.225 --> 00:28:32.275
You look nothing like Will Smith.

344
00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.825
If you come through on this case.
I'll tell you

345
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.175
that you look like Denzel
if you want me to.

346
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.775
What you telling me is you never seen
I. Robot?

347
00:28:41.075 --> 00:28:45.400
No. If you close this case.
I'll buy it on Blu-ray.

348
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.375
I'm going to hold you to that. Captain.

349
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.550
My dude. man.

350
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.375
I ain't seen you a year.
Looking all spiffy. man.

351
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.450
I'm trying to be like you
when I grow up. man.

352
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.600
-What's up?
-Man. anyway.

353
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.725
Listen. we're going to hit
this party tonight

354
00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:53.450
and I got a private meeting
with Heaven and her friends.

355
00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.725
What time are we doing all this?

356
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
The party don't start till about 9:00. but
you know Black folks pop around 11:00 or so.

357
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.275
-We always late to the party.
-That's a fact.

358
00:30:08.325 --> 00:30:11.325
You don't show up.
unless you meet the people.

359
00:30:12.675 --> 00:30:16.000
go on rounds.
make sure everyone feel you out.

360
00:30:16.075 --> 00:30:17.650
Make sure you straight.

361
00:30:17.825 --> 00:30:23.500
After that. we're going to be in there.
Don't come dressed all copish.

362
00:30:24.725 --> 00:30:26.875
You never pull no honeys like that.

363
00:30:28.375 --> 00:30:30.500
First off. let's get this straight.

364
00:30:31.675 --> 00:30:33.450
I can't have you out here committing
any felonies.

365
00:30:33.525 --> 00:30:38.225
Look at me.
No guns. no drugs. no fights.

366
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.625
We got to play this straight down the middle.
You feel me?

367
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.750
I changed my ways. and you know that.

368
00:30:45.275 --> 00:30:49.600
If I would've made better choices
in life. I'd be right beside you.

369
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:53.425
-What else you know about Heaven?
-Chill out. Robocop.

370
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.375
-Dude.
-Man. listen.

371
00:30:58.025 --> 00:30:59.875
It's her father. Vega. right?

372
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.175
The dude cast shadows.
everybody's scared of him.

373
00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.150
but Heaven.
she on the straight and narrow.

374
00:31:06.775 --> 00:31:08.475
The girl got a food truck.

375
00:31:08.775 --> 00:31:10.875
She's trying to call like
two more this year.

376
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:16.700
The girl beautiful. sexy.
all of that. but--

377
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.600
-But what?
-Man. it's her friend. Candy.

378
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.250
The girl gang. angry. upset.

379
00:31:26.475 --> 00:31:28.925
I'm just telling you. she going to make
it a horror for you to get to her.

380
00:31:29.075 --> 00:31:31.150
That's all I'm saying.
She in these streets for real.

381
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.225
like Omar of the Wild.

382
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.225
Omar of the Wild. What is this?
A TV show or something?

383
00:31:36.325 --> 00:31:37.825
I don't watch TV.

384
00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:40.825
Scratch all that. man.

385
00:31:40.975 --> 00:31:42.925
I'm just saying she is going to make it hard
for you to get to her.

386
00:31:43.025 --> 00:31:44.825
That's what I'm saying
at the end of the day.

387
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.450
-What do you know about her home girl. Red?
-Man. the white girl?

388
00:31:50.575 --> 00:31:52.150
She thinks she Black.

389
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.075
As long as you keep her happy.
you're in there.

390
00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.800
-That's it?
-Yes. that's it.

391
00:32:28.875 --> 00:32:32.200
That's really a happy birthday now.
Thank you.

392
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.450
What are you doing here?

393
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:44.150
I thought I'd stop by and wish you
a happy birthday.

394
00:32:45.475 --> 00:32:49.600
Only my friends were invited.
We're not friends.

395
00:32:51.875 --> 00:32:55.750
-What happened to us was--
-What happened to us? Us?

396
00:32:56.675 --> 00:33:01.275
What happened to me only happened to me
because you didn't say anything.

397
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.975
Oh. come on. Heaven.
I was Vega's assistant when Stan.

398
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:10.950
when he--

399
00:33:11.425 --> 00:33:14.900
If I had said anything.
I would have been killed.

400
00:33:15.175 --> 00:33:16.675
You could have told me. Ronda.

401
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:21.100
I could have helped you.
but instead you said nothing.

402
00:33:21.775 --> 00:33:25.525
Then he tried to force himself
onto me next. God.

403
00:33:27.275 --> 00:33:30.725
-I'm so sorry.
-That was almost two years ago.

404
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.825
-I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.
-I would've believed you.

405
00:33:37.075 --> 00:33:38.500
You don't believe me now.

406
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:42.375
People like you never give a damn until
something like this happens to them. too.

407
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:48.100
People like me?
You don't even know me.

408
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.300
I've been in and out of foster homes
for years. the bad kind.

409
00:33:53.775 --> 00:33:56.225
Don't act like I don't know
what it means to struggle.

410
00:33:58.775 --> 00:34:01.050
Well. look at you now.

411
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:04.825
The most dangerous man in Ohio
looks at you like you're his own daughter.

412
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.950
It looks to me like you forgot
what it means to struggle.

413
00:34:08.725 --> 00:34:12.525
Ronda. you need to leave right now
before I kill you.

414
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:45.425
Rogers. you just going to walk past me
like that and not say something?

415
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:49.425
Hey. Tonya. What's good?

416
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:51.700
I've been working on time.

417
00:34:51.925 --> 00:34:54.725
Why are you giving your sister. Ava.
a hard time?

418
00:34:55.325 --> 00:34:58.800
God only gave you one sister.
You need to be there for her.

419
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:05.425
God only gave me one father too. and Ava.
she took all that from me. just like stat.

420
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.000
You know she make bad decisions.

421
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:11.600
It's only a matter of time before
she can reap what she sowed.

422
00:35:11.725 --> 00:35:14.575
Look. I know it's hard.

423
00:35:14.825 --> 00:35:19.500
-I lost my dad too.
-I remember that.

424
00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.500
I'm sorry to hear about that.

425
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:27.600
Well. you don't have to worry about that
man doing anything else to you ever again.

426
00:35:28.275 --> 00:35:29.975
I made sure of that.

427
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.500
Now. I do want to apologize
to you for lashing out on you.

428
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.250
You didn't do this. Ronda.

429
00:35:36.475 --> 00:35:40.225
He did. You're not my enemy.

430
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:45.725
If you want to stay. you can stay. okay?

431
00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.175
I hate going to his memories.

432
00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:59.450
I suggest you do the same
thing too. but Ava.

433
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.450
she fell in love with the wrong man.

434
00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.625
You all understand how hard it is
to come back from that.

435
00:36:09.025 --> 00:36:11.150
You ain't telling me nothing.

436
00:36:11.675 --> 00:36:15.850
Ava been making bad decisions.
standing on our hope. but I have faith

437
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:17.900
that she could replace my father.

438
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
But every time I look at her. I see him.

439
00:36:25.525 --> 00:36:30.650
I ain't really trying to hear
nothing Ava's talking about.

440
00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.125
I'm sorry you feel that way.

441
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
I remember when we was in high school
and you used to beat up all the bullies.

442
00:36:42.475 --> 00:36:45.275
I might not be telling you nothing
that you don't know.

443
00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.675
but you ain't got to be in jail
to be in prison.

444
00:36:50.425 --> 00:36:54.650
Your sister. Ava. she's in jail.

445
00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:57.300
She's locked to her past.

446
00:36:57.475 --> 00:37:00.850
It might not be a physical jail.
but she's still there.

447
00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.175
I hate to see you locked up with her.

448
00:37:06.275 --> 00:37:09.900
That ain't going to happen to me.
Thank you. Seriously. Tonya. thank you.

449
00:37:11.375 --> 00:37:15.750
-I've got to get back to something. all right?
-Try to give her a call for me. please.

450
00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:22.825
Look out for your family because
the devil's always around the corner.

451
00:37:27.275 --> 00:37:28.900
The good thing about that too.

452
00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:33.250
not about that. but that God is there too.

453
00:37:33.625 --> 00:37:36.725
-All right. You take care. baby.
-Yes. you're right about all of that.

454
00:37:36.975 --> 00:37:40.750
Take care. See you later.

455
00:37:44.825 --> 00:37:48.700
-Hey. how're you doing?
-Hey. I'm so glad you could make it.

456
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:53.450
-Of course. Hey. Red. how're you doing?
-What's up. dawg? .

457
00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:56.925
I understand.
I need to talk to you all for a minute.

458
00:37:56.975 --> 00:37:58.125
You all follow me.

459
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.100
This my dawg right here.

460
00:38:11.225 --> 00:38:13.450
He crashed one of the lights
maybe a month or so.

461
00:38:13.625 --> 00:38:16.575
He got it together.
This right here. this is Heaven.

462
00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:21.025
This crazy girl right here.
she's crazy as hell. man. That's Red.

463
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.300
-What's up. birthday girl?
-How're you doing?

464
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:30.475
Good. Happy birthday.
Anthony told me a lot about you.

465
00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.250
-What about me?
-Oh. you need so paper too?

466
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.825
Hold on.

467
00:38:42.625 --> 00:38:45.825
Where Candy at?
I thought she would be here by now.

468
00:38:46.125 --> 00:38:49.625
You know Candy.
She's somewhere around here

469
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.325
trying to get all the girls.

470
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.675
Candy is Candy.
Where are you from. Rogers?

471
00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.900
From Akron.
last time when I was 12.

472
00:39:00.725 --> 00:39:02.675
-It ain't that bad here. though.
-Interesting.

473
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:05.975
-Why are you hanging out with Anthony?
-He and I go way back.

474
00:39:06.925 --> 00:39:08.850
See. after COVID hit. I lost my job.

475
00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:11.150
Now I'm just trying
to get back on my feet.

476
00:39:11.975 --> 00:39:14.425
The man was nice enough to let
me stay with him for a little bit.

477
00:39:15.425 --> 00:39:17.000
but your feet bang. shawty.

478
00:39:17.525 --> 00:39:19.975
When I first saw you walk over here.
I looked at you like.

479
00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.100
"She's got this Cardi B type of swag."
Hold on. let me guess.

480
00:39:25.225 --> 00:39:27.800
You're either a rapper or a singer.

481
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.625
God sent you here.
I love you.

482
00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.600
We just met.
but you see right through me.

483
00:39:37.625 --> 00:39:39.125
You see my truth.

484
00:39:42.525 --> 00:39:44.500
-I can say I understand you. but--
-You all calm down.

485
00:39:44.575 --> 00:39:46.100
I got an important announcement to make.

486
00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.375
It's your boy. DJ Date. I want to send
a happy birthday shout-out to the homegirl.

487
00:39:50.825 --> 00:39:53.400
Heaven. You all salute the birthday girl.

488
00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:56.175
Your girlfriend is going to be mad at you.

489
00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.800
but Ray ain't going to leave you alone.

490
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.750
You know what?
No girlfriend at the moment.

491
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.225
I'm just trying to get back on my feet.

492
00:40:08.325 --> 00:40:12.275
I have been thinking
about getting into the food industry.

493
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.425
like starting my own food truck.

494
00:40:15.975 --> 00:40:19.675
That's simple.
Did Anthony tell you about me?

495
00:40:20.575 --> 00:40:22.550
The only thing that Anthony told me
about you

496
00:40:22.675 --> 00:40:25.175
was that your body could stop time.

497
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:28.525
No. about my business.

498
00:40:29.575 --> 00:40:31.750
Rogers. you okay?

499
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.375
I'm sorry. See?

500
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.300
Just like that.
your body just stopped time.

501
00:40:39.875 --> 00:40:44.575
You know what?
Seriously though. I have a food truck.

502
00:40:45.025 --> 00:40:47.750
I would be interested to know
your ideas on food services.

503
00:40:48.425 --> 00:40:50.400
You can get my number from Anthony.

504
00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.925
-I'll do that.
-Do that.

505
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.000
I will.

506
00:40:55.125 --> 00:40:57.725
-Yo. what's up?
-Hey.

507
00:40:57.925 --> 00:40:59.925
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

508
00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.850
-How you been?
-I've been good.

509
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:05.750
-How're you?
-You know me. I just do my one-two.

510
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.375
-For real?
-For real.

511
00:41:13.125 --> 00:41:17.575
-Who was that?
-He's just a friend. but--

512
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:21.500
-What?
-Back to what you were saying.

513
00:41:21.825 --> 00:41:24.175
I was just saying who knows?

514
00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.375
Maybe one day we can
go into the industry.

515
00:41:27.375 --> 00:41:29.500
Rogers and Heaven Food Service.

516
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.175
Heaven and some dude getting
back on his feet.

517
00:41:41.375 --> 00:41:43.050
Put it like that.

518
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:46.175
I guess I have to make Heaven a priority.

519
00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.525
That is if your boyfriend
don't get jealous.

520
00:41:51.625 --> 00:41:54.650
No boyfriend.
I've been single for years.

521
00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:59.275
I don't have all that drama and stuff
that comes with relationships.

522
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:01.975
I don't have time for it.

523
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.075
You know it doesn't have to be that way.

524
00:42:10.275 --> 00:42:12.850
As long as you're willing
to put someone first.

525
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.150
great things can happen.

526
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:17.900
-You feeling that?
-Yes. that's true.

527
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.725
.
We got to go.

528
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.925
He came over feeling
like we got to get out.

529
00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:26.600
.
-I'm afraid that might not be possible.

530
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.225
-Did you pay the woman yet?
-Look. it's okay.

531
00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:32.500
I got to get back to my party anyway.
Y'all go handle your business.

532
00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.375
Anthony. make sure you give
Rogers my number. okay?

533
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.125
LJ. I didn't mean to bother you.

534
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.875
You didn't have to rush
all the way over here.

535
00:43:11.925 --> 00:43:13.950
Hey ma. you don't bother me.

536
00:43:14.225 --> 00:43:17.575
You never bother me.
You never bother me.

537
00:43:24.375 --> 00:43:25.700
What's going on?

538
00:43:28.375 --> 00:43:30.525
Diagnosis of COPD.

539
00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:33.150
It's emphysema.

540
00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:37.250
-What is that? Is it a kid?
-No.

541
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.050
I know I haven't been around lately.

542
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:44.925
I've been working a lot.

543
00:43:46.175 --> 00:43:48.325
I didn't even know if I could call you.

544
00:43:48.575 --> 00:43:50.675
I don't know if that number works.

545
00:43:51.375 --> 00:43:55.400
It's been four years.
Four years since I've even heard from you.

546
00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:58.925
When your dad died--

547
00:43:59.125 --> 00:44:01.550
Ma. ma. ma I didn't come over here
to talk about that.

548
00:44:02.225 --> 00:44:05.325
I know. I know. I know.
I need you to understand.

549
00:44:05.425 --> 00:44:07.850
-Son. I need you to--
-Ma. I don't know if you wanted to--

550
00:44:08.975 --> 00:44:12.425
Oh. you're here.
Wow. Four years later.

551
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:17.575
-What the hell is she doing here?
-What am I doing here?

552
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.025
We haven't seen you in four years and
you're asking me what am I doing here?

553
00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:23.375
I'm the one who
has been taken care of mom.

554
00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:25.725
I'm the one that's been here.
You haven't been here.

555
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.350
I'm not even in the mood
for your mouth today. okay?

556
00:44:28.925 --> 00:44:30.075
My mouth?

557
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:32.675
Look. if dad was here.
he'd have been taking care of mom.

558
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:34.750
You're the reason
we going through all this.

559
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.900
You show up like you haven't done
a thing.

560
00:44:38.925 --> 00:44:40.575
Hey. mom. why would you let her back
in your life?

561
00:44:40.725 --> 00:44:46.025
Son. you need to let it go
and let God helped you with it.

562
00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.425
I miss my husband every day.

563
00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.725
If we hold on to this hate.
it's going to kill us all.

564
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.675
LJ. I am sick.

565
00:44:56.575 --> 00:44:59.000
I don't know how much longer
I have to live.

566
00:44:59.625 --> 00:45:02.950
Do we really have to go
through all of this right now?

567
00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.150
Sorry. mom.

568
00:45:10.325 --> 00:45:12.800
-We don't need Ava's drama right now.
-My drama?

569
00:45:14.825 --> 00:45:18.875
You got some nerve talking about me.
You're not the only one in pain. LJ.

570
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:26.450
-You're not the only one who misses dad.
-Please. please. just let it be.

571
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.150
How many times have you told her
to leave Brandon?

572
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:41.700
The time he cracked your ribs.
or the time he broke your jaw?

573
00:45:42.575 --> 00:45:45.325
Oh. I guess it was the time he let you
stranded in Kentucky.

574
00:45:45.425 --> 00:45:46.875
Son. let it be. Just let it be.

575
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:51.125
No. I'm not letting it be.
Not this time.

576
00:45:51.875 --> 00:45:54.575
I've made mistakes.
We've all made mistakes.

577
00:45:54.725 --> 00:45:57.300
-Why can't you just let it go?
-This was more than a mistake.

578
00:45:57.675 --> 00:45:59.800
Your dad came to protect you
from this cat.

579
00:45:59.975 --> 00:46:02.250
Your man stopped beating you long enough
to kill your father.

580
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.775
I live with that every day.

581
00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:05.675
Every day.

582
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:09.450
Look. I'm going to school
to help women in my situation

583
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.850
because all I can do right now
is give back.

584
00:46:13.525 --> 00:46:19.375
You know what? Mom. do you need anything?

585
00:46:20.325 --> 00:46:23.975
I just wanted you to know
that I wasn't getting any better.

586
00:46:26.425 --> 00:46:30.850
My doctor told me I need
to get my affairs in order.

587
00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:41.000
Ma. mom. just tell me what it is.

588
00:46:41.875 --> 00:46:43.175
Just tell me what you need.

589
00:46:43.275 --> 00:46:48.850
What I don't need is to leave this world
knowing that our family is still broke.

590
00:46:49.475 --> 00:46:52.025
I need you to forgive your sister.

591
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.150
Ma. don't talk like that.
Everything is going to be all right.

592
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:05.275
Just let me know when your
next doctor's appointment is.

593
00:47:06.175 --> 00:47:09.050
I need you to forgive your sister.

594
00:47:13.225 --> 00:47:17.575
Thursday.
It's next Thursday at 12:30

595
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:22.825
and it's our first appointment
with a specialist at the Cleveland Clinic.

596
00:47:23.225 --> 00:47:26.875
I don't want to put you out. son.
Don't worry about it.

597
00:47:26.975 --> 00:47:31.250
-Ava and I will be just fine.
-Mom. I'll always be there for you.

598
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.400
Always.
I love you.

599
00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:37.050
You just let me know. okay?

600
00:47:41.314 --> 00:47:43.428
Saying the same for you.

601
00:47:59.514 --> 00:48:01.400
Hey.

602
00:48:02.914 --> 00:48:06.742
-Iesha. what is you doing here?
-Well. I'm walking.

603
00:48:06.885 --> 00:48:09.657
but I saw you across the way
so I thought I'd say hi.

604
00:48:13.371 --> 00:48:18.628
-Are you following me or something?
-.

605
00:48:18.971 --> 00:48:22.457
Look. calm down.
I've been working for like two months.

606
00:48:22.571 --> 00:48:24.428
I work at the Credit Union
down the street.

607
00:48:25.228 --> 00:48:29.942
-Why would I be following you?
-Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.

608
00:48:30.057 --> 00:48:33.400
It's just I got a lot going on right now.
I really got to go.

609
00:48:33.942 --> 00:48:36.485
I have something for you at the apartment.

610
00:48:43.971 --> 00:48:45.200
Yo. stop playing with me right now.

611
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.828
Do not play with my emotions like that.
I'm serious.

612
00:48:49.028 --> 00:48:50.714
I got it for you for your birthday.

613
00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.571
except I couldn't give it to you because
you already been gone by then.

614
00:48:56.942 --> 00:48:58.314
I know.

615
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.714
That was a crazy time.

616
00:49:02.542 --> 00:49:04.314
I gave you every--

617
00:49:04.857 --> 00:49:08.542
I got to go. all right.

618
00:49:10.085 --> 00:49:11.942
Look. I'm sorry
for everything that happened.

619
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.457
Even though we can't be a couple.

620
00:49:15.914 --> 00:49:17.828
I just like to apologize
for everything I've done wrong.

621
00:49:20.885 --> 00:49:23.771
Iesha. I'm working right now. All right?
Can we talk about this later?

622
00:49:25.428 --> 00:49:30.457
-Well. I do have to go back to work. Later?
-Good to see you again.

623
00:49:30.571 --> 00:49:32.000
You too.

624
00:49:46.914 --> 00:49:49.885
Wow. It's good to see you again. Heaven.

625
00:49:51.428 --> 00:49:53.114
I have to ask you a question.

626
00:49:53.685 --> 00:49:55.800
-What's up?
-Have you seen Anthony?

627
00:49:57.314 --> 00:50:00.142
No. not since we left your party.

628
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.285
He was acting a little weird.

629
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.857
Dropped me back off at his spot.

630
00:50:05.085 --> 00:50:07.514
I haven't seen him since.
What's going on?

631
00:50:08.142 --> 00:50:11.057
Well. some money came out
missing out of the room he was in.

632
00:50:11.714 --> 00:50:14.971
I just want to ask him a few questions
and see if he saw anything.

633
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.485
Look. if you need some money.
I don't mind.

634
00:50:20.257 --> 00:50:22.828
Oh. wait.
We just met each other.

635
00:50:23.028 --> 00:50:25.828
Don't go offering me money now.

636
00:50:26.542 --> 00:50:28.457
You're not like everybody else.

637
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.257
Well. thank you.
but I don't need your money.

638
00:50:33.228 --> 00:50:35.457
Wow.
You're just going to curve my money.

639
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.228
Out of all my years of living.

640
00:50:37.428 --> 00:50:39.828
I've never met a woman
that turned down free money.

641
00:50:40.342 --> 00:50:41.742
with no strings attached.

642
00:50:42.114 --> 00:50:44.742
Well. maybe you need to rethink
your definition of a woman.

643
00:50:45.457 --> 00:50:47.342
Maybe I do.

644
00:50:47.542 --> 00:50:49.628
Look. I had a vision.

645
00:50:51.057 --> 00:50:55.142
-The only problem with your food truck is--
-My food truck is a problem to you?

646
00:50:55.285 --> 00:50:57.971
Not the problem.
Come on. just hear me out.

647
00:50:58.971 --> 00:51:01.571
People come from this building.
they rush to your truck.

648
00:51:02.285 --> 00:51:04.200
They're the first people in line.

649
00:51:05.057 --> 00:51:07.771
Now. the only problem with that
is people get what.

650
00:51:08.285 --> 00:51:10.714
maybe an hour. 30 minutes
for their lunch break?

651
00:51:11.085 --> 00:51:13.428
They want food and they want it fast.

652
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.200
so they come in. they wait in line.

653
00:51:16.485 --> 00:51:18.914
Our top items are made ahead of time.

654
00:51:19.485 --> 00:51:21.828
so all of our regular customers
get served on time.

655
00:51:22.542 --> 00:51:25.314
I understand that. but I'm not talking
about the people that are already in line.

656
00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.571
What if you go in there and serve people
floor by floor before the rush?

657
00:51:29.857 --> 00:51:31.942
That way. the people
that can't make it to you.

658
00:51:32.142 --> 00:51:33.800
they can get something to eat in there.

659
00:51:34.371 --> 00:51:36.885
I'm promising it'll double your
profit every single day.

660
00:51:37.028 --> 00:51:40.942
Okay. okay. but what makes you think
I haven't already thought of that?

661
00:51:41.085 --> 00:51:44.457
Simple.
You haven't done it.

662
00:52:16.285 --> 00:52:17.857
-Hey.
-Hey.

663
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.228
Here's my favorite person.
What's going on?

664
00:52:20.371 --> 00:52:22.200
-I didn't know you was going to be here.
-I was just in the area.

665
00:52:22.314 --> 00:52:23.571
Did you want to talk to me
about something?

666
00:52:23.628 --> 00:52:26.285
Not this time. I just wanted to run
something by your friend here.

667
00:52:26.342 --> 00:52:28.228
You didn't come here to scare away
my boyfriend. did you?

668
00:52:28.285 --> 00:52:33.371
No. no. Boyfriend?
How are you doing? I'm Rogers.

669
00:52:33.514 --> 00:52:35.114
The name is Vega. Rogers.

670
00:52:35.342 --> 00:52:38.200
I just need to borrow your boyfriend
for a few minutes.

671
00:52:39.057 --> 00:52:41.800
-Just when I thought I was important.
-No. it's not like that.

672
00:52:41.914 --> 00:52:45.342
Let me just run some things by Rogers
and me and you can speak.

673
00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.400
-You want to take a walk. Rogers?
-Yes. sure.

674
00:52:48.971 --> 00:52:50.742
I know my daughter's falling
for you. Rogers.

675
00:52:51.228 --> 00:52:52.771
I see that look in her eye.

676
00:52:53.342 --> 00:52:56.914
I just want to let you know
if you're in Heaven's life.

677
00:52:57.657 --> 00:52:58.885
I'm in your life.

678
00:52:59.114 --> 00:53:02.514
You need anything. anything at all.
just don't hesitate to let me know.

679
00:53:03.971 --> 00:53:05.800
You know. man. I really appreciate that.

680
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.828
I mean. the last few days me and
Heaven been talking. it's been like heaven.

681
00:53:14.285 --> 00:53:16.285
I'm not sure if you met Candy yet.

682
00:53:17.914 --> 00:53:20.571
She has good intentions.
very protective over Heaven.

683
00:53:21.057 --> 00:53:24.228
Since you're involved. she's going to feel
like she's being replaced.

684
00:53:25.542 --> 00:53:27.714
I haven't met Candy. but I have met Red.

685
00:53:29.171 --> 00:53:30.457
That girl is wow.

686
00:53:31.142 --> 00:53:33.142
She did tell me you saved
her life before.

687
00:53:33.257 --> 00:53:35.971
Did you know in the foster care system
there are thousands--

688
00:53:36.514 --> 00:53:38.685
Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt you.
but we're looking for you for a while.

689
00:53:38.857 --> 00:53:42.371
-John. how's the lovely wife doing?
-She's doing great.

690
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:44.028
Listen. I can't thank you enough.

691
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.742
Paying off my house.

692
00:53:46.314 --> 00:53:49.085
I was behind three months
on the mortgage. so when the bank came.

693
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.857
I thought we were getting kicked out.

694
00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:53.257
They handed me the deed and said
thanks for being customers.

695
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.057
His family has been a pillar
of this community for years.

696
00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.400
I was not going to let nothing
happen to your family. John.

697
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.914
I truly can't thank you enough.

698
00:54:02.257 --> 00:54:05.285
Listen. come over next week for dinner.
My wife will be thrilled.

699
00:54:06.028 --> 00:54:09.114
-I'll be over there. You let her know.
-God bless you.

700
00:54:09.342 --> 00:54:10.885
I'll see you. John.

701
00:54:11.514 --> 00:54:13.714
Well. Rogers. there's things I got to do.

702
00:54:13.857 --> 00:54:16.914
and my daughter doesn't like to be waiting
for too long.

703
00:54:18.171 --> 00:54:19.571
I'm going to see you around. Rogers.

704
00:57:24.171 --> 00:57:26.228
What exactly are we doing here?

705
00:57:29.314 --> 00:57:31.400
We look like we're walking around
your town.

706
00:57:33.171 --> 00:57:36.371
We're starting to see each other every day.

707
00:57:37.428 --> 00:57:39.114
-Whatever you think.
-Okay.

708
00:57:39.571 --> 00:57:43.914
What's up with you. man?
Yo. man. what's up with you?

709
00:57:48.771 --> 00:57:51.571
My bad. Q. I didn't know that was you.

710
00:57:52.228 --> 00:57:55.285
Pause.
Y'all remember Hector. right?

711
00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:05.971
Now. I knew he ain't die.
but how the fuck he get out of jail?

712
00:58:15.114 --> 00:58:17.000
-You really think you can handle me?
-Stop. Heaven. I don't like that.

713
00:58:17.085 --> 00:58:18.142
Come on. Rogers--

714
00:58:21.828 --> 00:58:23.857
-show me what you got.
-Heaven. I said stop.

715
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.914
Leave me alone. all right?

716
00:58:27.942 --> 00:58:30.228
Damn. I was only playing.

717
00:59:37.342 --> 00:59:41.942
-Hey. how are you?
-Man. Dr. McCabe. not good.

718
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000
I mean. it's like I'm a clown at a circus
just juggling

719
00:59:50.685 --> 00:59:53.657
and life keeps throwing these balls
at me and I got to catch them.

720
00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:58.342
I can't keep up.
Something's got to give.

721
00:59:59.857 --> 01:00:01.914
Your mission has a deadline.

722
01:00:03.142 --> 01:00:06.657
It can't be long now before
this will all come to a close.

723
01:00:07.457 --> 01:00:10.000
Argh.

724
01:00:10.457 --> 01:00:15.971
-Go ahead. finish your thought.
-I've seen Vega do stuff for the community.

725
01:00:17.028 --> 01:00:19.542
Heaven's trying to get
her business off the ground.

726
01:00:19.942 --> 01:00:22.857
Meanwhile. Captain Hawkins is acting
like they're some Al Capone

727
01:00:22.971 --> 01:00:25.200
criminal super organization
or something.

728
01:00:25.742 --> 01:00:28.285
This whole mission is a waste of time.
I'm telling you.

729
01:00:32.742 --> 01:00:37.114
It is perfectly normal for an undercover
officer to lose perspective.

730
01:00:38.542 --> 01:00:41.485
Eight people died of overdoses this week.

731
01:00:42.057 --> 01:00:45.457
Do you think the parents of those
eight people would agree with you?

732
01:00:50.771 --> 01:00:54.200
Dr. McCabe. the closer I get to Heaven--

733
01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.057
How do you think Heaven
is going to feel when this is all over?

734
01:00:57.857 --> 01:01:00.485
When she finds out
that you're a police officer

735
01:01:01.714 --> 01:01:05.114
and that the only reason you're with her
is to take down the man

736
01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.742
that treats her like a daughter?

737
01:01:07.714 --> 01:01:11.400
This illusion of a relationship
is just that.

738
01:01:11.628 --> 01:01:16.085
It's an illusion. It's not real.

739
01:01:18.657 --> 01:01:20.371
I need you to understand something.

740
01:01:21.971 --> 01:01:23.942
I stab people in the back for a living.

741
01:01:25.342 --> 01:01:29.285
I get close to them.
I laugh at their jokes.

742
01:01:30.342 --> 01:01:31.714
I tell them they could trust me.

743
01:01:32.171 --> 01:01:34.828
Then boom. a knife in their back.

744
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.342
It's my job and I'm good at it.

745
01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:45.742
Hey. Rogers. don't lose
sight of your mission.

746
01:01:46.028 --> 01:01:49.000
You are not here to judge
who's good or who's evil.

747
01:01:50.142 --> 01:01:55.342
The law is the law.
and you're there to uphold it.

748
01:01:59.485 --> 01:02:02.942
They trust me.
They treat me like family.

749
01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.114
They're not your family.
They're your mission.

750
01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.257
You have a family.

751
01:02:09.428 --> 01:02:13.342
-Your mom needs. your sister. Ava. needs you.
-They don't need me.

752
01:02:13.742 --> 01:02:17.171
Make peace with your real family.

753
01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.600
Easier said than done.

754
01:02:24.142 --> 01:02:29.200
When it comes to relationships
usually is. but you can do--

755
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.114
I'm not sure why you wanted
to meet him here today.

756
01:02:55.657 --> 01:03:00.742
You know. with everything
that's going on.

757
01:03:02.857 --> 01:03:07.400
it might not be that safe
for us to be out in the open like this.

758
01:03:11.085 --> 01:03:14.600
Something's wrong.
The feds aren't following me anymore.

759
01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.771
All my contacts in the local law
enforcement have gone dark.

760
01:03:21.285 --> 01:03:27.314
-It's time to move on.
-What does that mean for us?

761
01:03:32.114 --> 01:03:39.857
It means we're done with Ohio. Warren.
Austintown. Youngstown. we're done with it.

762
01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:43.485
You want me to push everything up now?

763
01:03:45.771 --> 01:03:47.714
Yes. we're going to have to move
the schedule.

764
01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:50.828
When your enemies change. you do as well.

765
01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:53.485
I would never let my ego influence
what I do.

766
01:03:53.771 --> 01:03:57.114
That's how you get caught.
I have the one thing that they lack.

767
01:03:57.371 --> 01:04:00.657
That's conviction.
I need you do me a favor.

768
01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:06.542
-What's that?
-Find Rogers. follow him.

769
01:04:07.514 --> 01:04:09.685
be my ace in the hole.

770
01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.571
I thought you'd never ask.

771
01:05:30.085 --> 01:05:34.228
Is all this really that necessary?

772
01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:41.714
-What is you doing here?
-You cool? Come in and find out.

773
01:05:46.096 --> 01:05:52.000
-Man. pretty strong for a girl.
-The next time you put a gun in my face.

774
01:05:52.304 --> 01:05:54.176
you better pull the trigger.

775
01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:00.208
I will. I got you.
Ladies first.

776
01:06:01.168 --> 01:06:06.576
Well. the truth is that I really
haven't seen my son for about four years.

777
01:06:06.656 --> 01:06:09.488
He showed up a little while ago.
but I'm glad.

778
01:06:09.584 --> 01:06:12.512
I'm glad to see that he has
so many nice friends

779
01:06:12.608 --> 01:06:14.592
that I just didn't even know about.

780
01:06:14.736 --> 01:06:16.576
It's just really a pleasure.
Son.

781
01:06:16.704 --> 01:06:18.048
Rogers.

782
01:06:18.704 --> 01:06:22.512
Why you never introduce me
to your mother and your lovely sister?

783
01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.336
Did you know your mother's a baker?

784
01:06:25.408 --> 01:06:28.784
Three-year champ chicken pot pie.
Marvelous.

785
01:06:29.616 --> 01:06:32.736
-I'm so glad you're here.
-I'll be right back. mom.

786
01:06:33.024 --> 01:06:35.232
What's wrong.
Please don't be upset.

787
01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:39.632
Thursday when I was taking
an employee home from work.

788
01:06:39.984 --> 01:06:42.048
I drove by and I seen you
leaving this house.

789
01:06:42.704 --> 01:06:46.304
I know how secretive you are. but
I wanted to come by and surprise you.

790
01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:49.296
I didn't have no idea it was
your mother's house though.

791
01:06:52.096 --> 01:06:54.800
I know you didn't.
Why is Vega here?

792
01:06:55.904 --> 01:06:58.928
-Why he got a gun in my mom's house?
-Calm down.

793
01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.064
It's Youngstown.
-Yes. this is Youngstown.

794
01:07:03.664 --> 01:07:05.104
-Everybody got a gun.
-Excuse me?

795
01:07:05.712 --> 01:07:07.456
I need to talk to you for a minute.

796
01:07:10.576 --> 01:07:11.520
Look. I'm sorry.

797
01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.248
I had no clue who was at the door.

798
01:07:14.128 --> 01:07:17.184
Since I'm afraid of the cops.
I figured I should call you.

799
01:07:18.592 --> 01:07:22.688
Ava. you're cool.
You did the right thing.

800
01:07:24.128 --> 01:07:25.360
How long they been here?

801
01:07:26.464 --> 01:07:29.584
I don't know. 30. maybe 40 minutes.

802
01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.408
Look. I think that's the guy
I saw on the news.

803
01:07:33.664 --> 01:07:35.984
Some type of drug kingpin or something.

804
01:07:37.456 --> 01:07:41.072
-Yes. you're right. it's him.
-You have some nerves.

805
01:07:42.144 --> 01:07:46.560
Always talking about me making bad
decisions and hanging around the wrong men

806
01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.632
and people.

807
01:07:47.872 --> 01:07:50.656
but here you are bringing drug
pushers into our mama's house.

808
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.144
Ava. you just calm down.

809
01:07:52.352 --> 01:07:54.112
We ain't got time for this right now.

810
01:07:55.152 --> 01:07:56.576
-I'ma handle this. All right?
-Yes.

811
01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.280
We just stood there staring at this lady
wondering if she was .

812
01:08:07.968 --> 01:08:10.848
That's a funny story.
I haven't laughed so hard like that.

813
01:08:10.928 --> 01:08:12.800
-I missed that laugh.
-You had to have been there.

814
01:08:13.408 --> 01:08:17.888
Rogers. I need to go on my way.
but I have to make sure our mom is okay.

815
01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:23.312
-Our mom?
-Yes. Well. Rogers is family now.

816
01:08:24.672 --> 01:08:28.416
so your mom is our mom.

817
01:08:29.776 --> 01:08:33.200
It's all good. Vega.
and I appreciate it.

818
01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:34.128
but I have--

819
01:08:34.192 --> 01:08:35.936
Hold on. Hold on.
I know you got it. I know you got it.

820
01:08:35.984 --> 01:08:39.712
That's why I took the liberty upon myself
to hire nurse practitioner. Sandy Baker.

821
01:08:39.904 --> 01:08:41.456
who'll be working on your mother's vital--

822
01:08:42.192 --> 01:08:45.264
I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend
anyone. but we don't know you.

823
01:08:46.416 --> 01:08:48.336
-Ava.
-Mom. we don't know her.

824
01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.816
-Please. don't be that way.
-To have a stranger up in your house.

825
01:08:51.152 --> 01:08:56.416
Mr. Vega. I do appreciate and thank you
for your concern. but this is a lot.

826
01:08:56.512 --> 01:08:59.360
-A lot.
-It's not just for you.

827
01:09:00.032 --> 01:09:01.424
It's for me as well.

828
01:09:02.368 --> 01:09:04.608
My mother died of pancreatic cancer
four years ago.

829
01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:07.328
-Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that.
-I never been over it.

830
01:09:10.416 --> 01:09:12.576
Hey. Mrs. Rogers. take a breath.

831
01:09:13.424 --> 01:09:16.848
I'm here to take care of you. okay?
Trust that.

832
01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:23.328
-Okay.
-Okay. Mrs. Rogers. take a deep breath.

833
01:09:27.184 --> 01:09:29.472
Another.

834
01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.864
Mrs. Rogers.
you don't have to worry about anything.

835
01:09:35.168 --> 01:09:36.368
I'm here to take care of you.

836
01:09:37.088 --> 01:09:39.616
I've worked at the Cleveland Clinic
for three years.

837
01:09:40.016 --> 01:09:41.184
but now I work for you.

838
01:09:41.328 --> 01:09:45.600
-Okay.
-That's a good idea.

839
01:09:46.752 --> 01:09:49.440
The hospital is not a place
for anyone right now.

840
01:09:50.192 --> 01:09:54.592
They've got COVID. MRSA.
God only knows what else.

841
01:09:55.248 --> 01:09:56.832
There's no crime in giving this a try.

842
01:09:57.184 --> 01:09:58.496
Can I tell them this part?

843
01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:06.176
Well. dad is renting the house
next door for Sandy.

844
01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.064
so she'll be here anytime you need her.

845
01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.480
-Isn't that wonderful?
-Isn't that crazy?

846
01:10:10.544 --> 01:10:13.072
-You can't be serious.
-Seriously.

847
01:10:13.424 --> 01:10:17.296
If there's one thing I can't do
is put a price tag on our mother's life.

848
01:10:17.808 --> 01:10:19.680
We both want the same thing here.

849
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.104
Fine.

850
01:10:26.336 --> 01:10:30.800
Truth be told. I was drowning
in copays and premiums.

851
01:10:32.496 --> 01:10:34.480
Thank you so much.
God bless you.

852
01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.064
I hope when I'm down and out.

853
01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.416
the good Lord blesses me with his favor.

854
01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.856
With that-- All right?

855
01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:13.616
Now. do me a favor. call Heaven.

856
01:11:14.976 --> 01:11:18.384
I have been trying to. man.
She is not picking up.

857
01:11:19.248 --> 01:11:23.248
Okay. well. put that away.

858
01:11:24.496 --> 01:11:28.016
go to the crib.
tell them I found Anthony.

859
01:11:28.816 --> 01:11:31.952
I'm about to go back and get this money
and the .

860
01:11:32.544 --> 01:11:36.304
You know what?
You might want to remember I'm the OG here.

861
01:11:36.352 --> 01:11:38.960
You might want to remember this.

862
01:11:39.408 --> 01:11:46.336
-You know what? Red?
-Yo. I'll be back.

863
01:11:47.616 --> 01:11:50.928
You. just be you.

864
01:11:54.688 --> 01:11:57.824
Yes. as I was stating. it's all cool.

865
01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:02.976
Yo. Ant.

866
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.296
-Hey. hey.
-No. you done messed up. bro.

867
01:12:07.872 --> 01:12:08.928
-Listen. Listen.
-You know you done messed up.

868
01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:11.168
-Listen. Listen.
-No. for real.

869
01:12:11.216 --> 01:12:12.784
-Baby. you--
-The moment you stole from me.

870
01:12:13.168 --> 01:12:14.640
that's the moment you signed
your death warrant.

871
01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.816
-You're about to die today.
-Baby. you're looking good.

872
01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:18.128
-You're looking good as hell.
-No. I'm tired of you.

873
01:12:18.176 --> 01:12:20.704
I'm tired of you and all your stuff.
You're about to die. bro.

874
01:12:20.768 --> 01:12:25.664
Hey. All right. listen. I've got some very
valuable information for you. okay?

875
01:12:26.224 --> 01:12:30.064
The reason why I took the money was
because there were so many people around.

876
01:12:30.464 --> 01:12:33.072
I didn't want nobody else to get it.
You know where to find me at.

877
01:12:34.064 --> 01:12:35.808
Roger and Heaven.

878
01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.984
I was sent in to actually
help out with that. okay?

879
01:12:41.152 --> 01:12:43.168
I'm an informant for the cops. all right?

880
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.616
Man. you're lying. man.
Don't nobody got no time for this.

881
01:12:45.664 --> 01:12:47.120
-Listen. I know--
-Man. you slow?

882
01:12:47.232 --> 01:12:48.336
-Hey.
-You slow?

883
01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.624
-No.
-You got a mental disorder or something like that?

884
01:12:50.704 --> 01:12:53.920
-No. no. Listen.
-No. I ain't got time for this. you lying?

885
01:12:54.016 --> 01:12:56.272
I know who going to be there.
when they going to be there

886
01:12:56.496 --> 01:12:57.856
and when it's going down.

887
01:12:58.064 --> 01:12:59.728
Who do you think I am?
You know I don't play.

888
01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.704
-You know I don't play.
-Listen. I am your only hope to success. okay?

889
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.000
Listen to me.

890
01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.888
Obviously. you can find me. okay?

891
01:13:08.368 --> 01:13:10.928
You found me now.
I'm in the hood all day.

892
01:13:11.792 --> 01:13:12.944
You know that.

893
01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.104
We ain't even got to make it like this.

894
01:13:15.888 --> 01:13:17.712
-You know me. baby. it's cool.
-Look--

895
01:13:18.032 --> 01:13:21.712
It's cool. and you're looking good.
you're looking nice.

896
01:13:21.824 --> 01:13:24.576
You're looking like you're about to die.
You're about to die.

897
01:13:31.504 --> 01:13:34.784
Hey. I've been looking all over for you.

898
01:13:35.424 --> 01:13:36.736
-Sure. you have.
-I've got some--

899
01:13:50.688 --> 01:13:53.328
Yes. Vega. I've got him.

900
01:14:31.184 --> 01:14:32.384
You wanted to see me?

901
01:14:35.168 --> 01:14:36.896
One thing I learned about these streets.

902
01:14:40.064 --> 01:14:41.584
they're always teaching me something new.

903
01:14:43.664 --> 01:14:45.104
I hate rats.

904
01:14:49.984 --> 01:14:51.184
Do you hate rats?

905
01:14:53.376 --> 01:14:57.760
-Yo. he still ain't talking.
-That's too bad.

906
01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.208
-Yo. what y'all here doing to Anthony. man.
-Back up. Back up. Yo. back up.

907
01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:10.928
-Yo. y'all ain't got to kill him.
-This is very important right now.

908
01:15:11.264 --> 01:15:14.640
What do you know about Anthony?

909
01:15:15.312 --> 01:15:18.496
I mean. I know him from back in the day.

910
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.824
We went to school together.
Anthony. good peoples.

911
01:15:22.368 --> 01:15:24.272
Yo. if he stole something.
I could pay his debt.

912
01:15:24.528 --> 01:15:26.256
Yo. it's not that simple.

913
01:15:28.016 --> 01:15:31.776
Word on the streets
is there's a rat loose.

914
01:15:33.488 --> 01:15:36.272
If I'm not mistaken. Anthony's the rat.

915
01:15:38.016 --> 01:15:41.264
He's feeding our every move to five-o.

916
01:15:41.968 --> 01:15:45.888
First you say he's a cop.
then you say he stole money from Heaven.

917
01:15:46.992 --> 01:15:49.600
-It's got to be some other explanation.
-He's not a cop.

918
01:15:49.856 --> 01:15:51.088
He's an informant.

919
01:15:51.488 --> 01:15:54.528
They busted him in jail for whatever.
he's out on the streets.

920
01:15:54.592 --> 01:15:57.104
That's what he does.
He's a rat.

921
01:15:58.352 --> 01:16:01.376
-I can get you the money back. Vega.
-It's not about the money.

922
01:16:02.144 --> 01:16:04.800
He's a snitch. He dies. It's simple.

923
01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.552
What you call me here for. to watch?

924
01:16:12.064 --> 01:16:13.856
You're going to be my exterminator.

925
01:16:15.552 --> 01:16:19.088
-No. I ain't killing nobody.
-You can't do it?

926
01:16:19.776 --> 01:16:21.696
-I can't do it.
-You're telling me you can't do it?

927
01:16:21.856 --> 01:16:25.232
-Nope.
-Anthony. what you got to say for yourself?

928
01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.984
It's not me. It's not me.

929
01:16:30.832 --> 01:16:32.608
I know who runs the city. it's you.

930
01:16:33.232 --> 01:16:34.944
The city wouldn't be nothing without you.

931
01:16:35.728 --> 01:16:37.968
Vega. I am not a rat.

932
01:16:42.096 --> 01:16:44.688
You've got two minutes
before you eat this bullet.

933
01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:49.232
It's Rogers.
It's Rogers.

934
01:16:50.112 --> 01:16:54.432
He was sent in to get close to Heaven.

935
01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.624
He's the cop.

936
01:16:59.216 --> 01:17:00.432
Give me a chance.

937
01:17:00.976 --> 01:17:02.640
I can get in close with the cops.

938
01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.576
I can get in. get all the information
and report back to you.

939
01:17:08.304 --> 01:17:09.504
Give me a chance.

940
01:17:18.304 --> 01:17:19.664
Did you believe this guy?

941
01:17:21.328 --> 01:17:26.000
You're trying to save his life and pay his
debt and he's trying to get you killed.

942
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:30.704
-This is a special kind of rat right here.
-Special kind of rat.

943
01:17:32.784 --> 01:17:37.328
Man. listen. Listen.
He was sent to set you up.

944
01:17:39.184 --> 01:17:44.416
-Jesus Christ. Listen to me.
-Do not take the Lord's name in vain.

945
01:17:49.872 --> 01:17:50.800
What now?

946
01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:57.392
I like you. Rogers.
If I let this rat go.

947
01:17:58.208 --> 01:18:00.288
he'll start saying he works for the FBI.

948
01:18:00.624 --> 01:18:03.200
He'll do anything to save his own hide.

949
01:18:03.936 --> 01:18:07.904
-Ace. it's up to you.
-If we let him go. he'll just call the cops.

950
01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:10.912
If he don't call the cops.

951
01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:13.984
he'll tell everybody
how he stole from you-

952
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.368
-I won't do that.
--and you did nothing about it.

953
01:18:16.432 --> 01:18:17.456
I won't do that.

954
01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.688
-Come on. Vega. you ain't got to kill him.
-I won't do that.

955
01:18:21.136 --> 01:18:24.080
Do you believe this guy. Ace?
He still wants to save this piece of trash.

956
01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.400
No.

957
01:18:27.872 --> 01:18:31.056
It's up to you.

958
01:18:34.656 --> 01:18:36.832
No. man. I told you.
you ain't have to kill him. man.

959
01:18:36.992 --> 01:18:41.440
Hey. hey. over. it's over.
It's done.

960
01:18:41.664 --> 01:18:44.480
I got a cleanup crew coming through
any minute.

961
01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.304
They won't have no trace of us
ever being here.

962
01:18:50.544 --> 01:18:52.576
Listen. okay? We're family now.

963
01:18:52.784 --> 01:18:54.592
Family takes care of each other.

964
01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.696
You did good. okay?
You did real good.

965
01:18:57.792 --> 01:18:59.952
Keep your cell phone on.
We'll contact you.

966
01:19:00.112 --> 01:19:02.736
It was just a bad dream.
Come on. boy.

967
01:19:06.256 --> 01:19:07.024
My boy.

968
01:19:07.184 --> 01:19:09.088
Hello. we are not available now.

969
01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:12.128
Please leave your name
and phone number after the beep.

970
01:19:13.296 --> 01:19:17.632
Rogers. me and Sergeant Jackson
need to see you immediately.

971
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.672
What's going on?

972
01:19:31.776 --> 01:19:33.408
Somebody say something.

973
01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.056
Look. it's a lot going on.

974
01:19:35.392 --> 01:19:37.520
-I think I can come up with a way--
-They're shutting us down.

975
01:19:39.376 --> 01:19:41.856
They're going to raid
Vega's place next week.

976
01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.496
Why would they do that right now?

977
01:19:44.912 --> 01:19:46.256
I'm so close.

978
01:19:46.704 --> 01:19:50.064
-I just need a little bit more time.
-Time is something we don't have. Rogers.

979
01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:53.840
We have every reason to believe
that someone in this office

980
01:19:54.464 --> 01:19:56.640
is giving information to Vega.

981
01:19:57.408 --> 01:19:59.024
That puts you in danger.

982
01:19:59.904 --> 01:20:02.528
We don't need an undercover cop
dead on our hands.

983
01:20:03.296 --> 01:20:05.120
Wait. wait. wait. wait.

984
01:20:05.728 --> 01:20:08.240
If Vegas was on to me.
don't y'all think I would know that?

985
01:20:09.248 --> 01:20:11.792
Who's to say anybody leaking
information to Vega?

986
01:20:12.368 --> 01:20:16.560
Well. when you have three informants
die on the same day.

987
01:20:16.832 --> 01:20:18.912
it's more than just a coincidence.

988
01:20:20.608 --> 01:20:25.168
Well. I tried to keep this information
from certain people.

989
01:20:26.576 --> 01:20:31.168
I wanted to nail this bastard
before the higher ups found out about it.

990
01:20:32.096 --> 01:20:33.488
Now that they know.

991
01:20:34.864 --> 01:20:36.880
they just want to arrest everyone.

992
01:20:37.344 --> 01:20:41.328
They can find and pray
that someone flips on Vega.

993
01:20:42.032 --> 01:20:43.680
That's the wrong move.

994
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.064
Just give me one more week.

995
01:20:46.496 --> 01:20:47.856
That's all I need.

996
01:20:48.048 --> 01:20:49.936
I'll hold them off for as long as I can.

997
01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.944
but that really isn't the issue right now.

998
01:20:53.008 --> 01:20:55.568
Just give me as much time as you can.
all right?

999
01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:58.176
Yes. we need to find the lead

1000
01:20:59.536 --> 01:21:00.912
or you're as good as dead.

1001
01:21:09.792 --> 01:21:13.856
Rogers. be careful.

1002
01:21:45.056 --> 01:21:47.776
-Hey. John. how've you been?
-Hey. OG. what's going on with you?

1003
01:21:47.904 --> 01:21:50.512
-What's happening?
-Not much. Same stuff. different day. you know.

1004
01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:55.872
-I know. Yes. I know.
-Hey. you know Heaven's boyfriend?

1005
01:21:56.256 --> 01:21:57.200
Of course.

1006
01:21:58.176 --> 01:22:01.408
-You seen him?
-Actually. he just passed right by me.

1007
01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.296
There he goes there.

1008
01:22:23.088 --> 01:22:25.312
-What's going on?
-It's about time we meet. man.

1009
01:22:25.744 --> 01:22:28.176
I'm Candy. I'm Heaven's best friend.

1010
01:22:29.648 --> 01:22:33.136
Heaven's best-- Hey. yo. is Haven cool?
Something happen to Heaven?

1011
01:22:35.136 --> 01:22:38.352
Man. hey. watch it.
Watch it. dude.

1012
01:22:38.608 --> 01:22:40.736
-I'm just asking. is Heaven cool?
-You know what? Turn around.

1013
01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.480
I don't know what's going on.

1014
01:22:46.592 --> 01:22:48.640
Now I know why she
never wanted us to meet.

1015
01:22:49.536 --> 01:22:53.216
-I been knew you was a cop.
-Whoa. what's all this cop stuff?

1016
01:22:53.424 --> 01:22:55.328
-I ain't no cop.
-Man. shut up.

1017
01:22:56.128 --> 01:22:58.224
Anthony. already told me everything. B.

1018
01:22:59.712 --> 01:23:00.640
You out here lying.

1019
01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.352
You thought you
was going to take down Vega.

1020
01:23:04.832 --> 01:23:07.792
No. no. not today.

1021
01:23:08.352 --> 01:23:09.680
I don't know what you're talking about.

1022
01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.112
Anthony. everybody know Anthony a liar.

1023
01:23:12.928 --> 01:23:14.528
-You going to listen to him?
-Shut up.

1024
01:23:14.576 --> 01:23:16.592
-I ain't seen him in a minute.
-Man. shut up.

1025
01:23:25.648 --> 01:23:27.408
Going to get me a little bonus today.

1026
01:23:28.912 --> 01:23:31.728
Yo. whatever it is. whatever you're talking
about. we can straighten it out right now.

1027
01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.264
Vegas going to pay me good.

1028
01:23:33.328 --> 01:23:35.184
He going to pay me good
to take out this trash.

1029
01:23:35.456 --> 01:23:37.936
-Vega.
-You already know what it is.

1030
01:23:39.232 --> 01:23:42.096
You're cop. you're liar. you're a sneak.

1031
01:23:43.088 --> 01:23:45.968
-I ain't no cop.
-Oh no. you're going to die today. bro.

1032
01:23:58.592 --> 01:24:04.160
-Roger. I had to do it.
-Hold on. hold on. hold on.

1033
01:24:04.544 --> 01:24:06.928
-We need to call the cops.
-No. No. no. we ain't got to call the cops.

1034
01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.024
We ain't got to call cops.
Don't worry about that.

1035
01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.320
-What I need you to do is get home.
-What? No. Rogers. I'm not going down for this.

1036
01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.088
You have to get home.
you're not going to go down for this.

1037
01:24:15.168 --> 01:24:17.648
I'm going to take care of everything.
Take these clothes. burn them.

1038
01:24:17.808 --> 01:24:19.584
Throw them away.
Is that gun registered?

1039
01:24:19.664 --> 01:24:20.672
No. it's a friend's.

1040
01:24:20.832 --> 01:24:22.752
Take that gun and throw it in the river.
all right?

1041
01:24:23.008 --> 01:24:25.424
Get rid of. I can't explain right now.
Just let me take care of this.

1042
01:24:25.456 --> 01:24:26.560
-This is crazy.
-I'll call you later.

1043
01:24:26.624 --> 01:24:28.128
Just get home. do what I said. okay?

1044
01:25:30.192 --> 01:25:35.136
So far. they don't have
any new information.

1045
01:25:36.432 --> 01:25:38.368
It looks as if it was a professional hit.

1046
01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:46.080
One shot to the back. close range.

1047
01:25:49.072 --> 01:25:52.128
No evidence. no shell cases.

1048
01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.544
They don't have a clue.

1049
01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.792
I'm so sorry.

1050
01:26:09.008 --> 01:26:10.640
We're going to get down
to the bottom of this.

1051
01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:14.672
Whoever killed Candy.
we're going to find them

1052
01:26:14.912 --> 01:26:16.864
and they're going to pay.

1053
01:26:25.584 --> 01:26:27.344
Where's Anthony?

1054
01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.136
Red told me that she saw Candy
follow him yesterday.

1055
01:26:34.256 --> 01:26:35.840
We have to find him.

1056
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.384
Ace saw both of them
having a conversation yesterday.

1057
01:26:38.496 --> 01:26:40.448
Candy ran off after the conversation.

1058
01:26:41.104 --> 01:26:42.784
Then who would do something like this?

1059
01:26:44.176 --> 01:26:48.352
I know Candy acted tough a lot.
but she won't actually hurt anyone.

1060
01:26:51.168 --> 01:26:53.200
-Did she have any enemies?
-No.

1061
01:26:53.568 --> 01:26:56.336
-Who else could have wanted her dead?
-I don't know.

1062
01:26:57.776 --> 01:27:00.944
-Where's Rogers?
-I don't know.

1063
01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.192
-I've been calling him for a few days.
-A few days?

1064
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:07.904
We got to find Rogers.

1065
01:27:08.624 --> 01:27:10.384
What if something happened to him too?

1066
01:27:10.464 --> 01:27:12.800
No. something is going to happen to him
if he don't come here.

1067
01:27:12.896 --> 01:27:14.528
think that way.

1068
01:27:15.424 --> 01:27:18.000
He's a big boy.
I'm sure he can take care of himself.

1069
01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.272
-What are y'all doing here?
-You do your job and we'll do ours.

1070
01:27:22.464 --> 01:27:24.528
I'm trying to do my job.
but y'all have to leave.

1071
01:27:25.008 --> 01:27:27.152
You know we all know what happened. right?

1072
01:27:27.424 --> 01:27:30.512
That's fine. but y'all have to leave.
I got this.

1073
01:27:48.176 --> 01:27:49.696
What a butt-hole.

1074
01:27:51.504 --> 01:27:53.888
-Rogers.
-Hey. speak of the devil.

1075
01:27:53.904 --> 01:28:00.224
Where have you been?
I've called you. I needed you.

1076
01:28:01.872 --> 01:28:05.168
Just give me one second. all right?

1077
01:28:05.872 --> 01:28:09.360
I'm so sorry to hear
about your daughter Candy.

1078
01:28:11.056 --> 01:28:13.408
If there's anything I can do.
just let me know.

1079
01:28:17.408 --> 01:28:20.768
I know it's not much.
but whatever can help. okay?.

1080
01:28:21.952 --> 01:28:23.280
I'm sorry. everyone.

1081
01:28:24.224 --> 01:28:26.720
I heard about Candy's death on the news.

1082
01:28:28.016 --> 01:28:29.424
I have an idea.

1083
01:28:34.256 --> 01:28:35.856
We could ask the Bishop.

1084
01:28:40.496 --> 01:28:41.792
Who the hell is the Bishop?

1085
01:28:43.088 --> 01:28:50.112
The bishop. he's the eyes and ears
to everything that goes on around here.

1086
01:28:51.728 --> 01:28:57.824
For a small fee. he could tell you
anything about anybody.

1087
01:28:58.448 --> 01:29:00.288
He deals in secrets.

1088
01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.896
You'd be surprised the amount of crazy
things people would do for those secrets.

1089
01:29:07.296 --> 01:29:10.128
Well. I ain't never heard of him.

1090
01:29:11.424 --> 01:29:13.920
Most of the craziness
that's been done around here.

1091
01:29:14.672 --> 01:29:16.544
the Bishop has given up information.

1092
01:29:19.376 --> 01:29:23.504
Okay. so how do we find
this Wizard of Oz?

1093
01:29:25.152 --> 01:29:27.920
He gets more death threats than Obama.

1094
01:29:28.032 --> 01:29:30.816
You're going to have to walk down a yellow
brick road to get a meeting with him.

1095
01:29:33.872 --> 01:29:35.104
but I can set up a meeting
with him tomorrow.

1096
01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:41.040
I don't care what it cost. daddy.
I'll even sell my food truck if I have to.

1097
01:29:44.368 --> 01:29:46.000
I just want to know what happened
to Candy.

1098
01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.944
-I'll do anything.
-Hey. hey. all that is unnecessary.

1099
01:29:49.408 --> 01:29:50.768
I'll take care of it.

1100
01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:54.864
I mean. if it's cool. Vega.
I'll tag along if you want me to.

1101
01:29:55.472 --> 01:29:58.528
-I don't mind. we can all go.
-I ain't going nowhere.

1102
01:29:59.344 --> 01:30:00.960
I wasn't talking to you.

1103
01:30:03.056 --> 01:30:04.640
Usually. he only allows two people

1104
01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.088
but he probably can make
an exception of me though.

1105
01:30:07.152 --> 01:30:09.776
One thing about him his bodyguards
have bodyguards.

1106
01:30:12.432 --> 01:30:15.312
-I think I'm going to be sick.
-Come here. baby.

1107
01:30:17.376 --> 01:30:18.864
We got you. all right?

1108
01:30:22.304 --> 01:30:25.920
-I got your back.
-Who do you want to go with us to this meeting?

1109
01:30:27.072 --> 01:30:33.920
-Rodgers. I just don't trust Rodgers.

1110
01:30:35.584 --> 01:30:40.080
-I know he knows something more.
-Don't be quick to judge.

1111
01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:46.208
If something's going on
we will find out soon enough.

1112
01:30:55.168 --> 01:30:56.736
It's been over an hour.

1113
01:30:57.488 --> 01:30:58.832
How long is this supposed to take?

1114
01:30:58.992 --> 01:31:01.696
I've been in this city all my life

1115
01:31:05.888 --> 01:31:08.480
Yes. we are wasting time.

1116
01:31:08.752 --> 01:31:13.312
We could be out looking for people.
finding witnesses. or something.

1117
01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:18.544
Yo. that's what I'm talking about.

1118
01:31:21.312 --> 01:31:22.752
Everybody be patient.

1119
01:31:24.832 --> 01:31:28.192
Be patient. Bishop just wants to know
how bad you want the information.

1120
01:31:28.336 --> 01:31:30.960
that is all.
We're probably being watched right now.

1121
01:31:31.312 --> 01:31:36.352
He never meets in the same place twice.
so don't nobody do anything drastic.

1122
01:31:38.272 --> 01:31:39.296
I'll try.

1123
01:31:52.176 --> 01:31:53.328
Hand them over.

1124
01:31:57.488 --> 01:31:59.904
-Hand over what?
-You already know.

1125
01:32:00.176 --> 01:32:01.040
Ace.

1126
01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.488
You. too. Rodg. you know what time it is.

1127
01:32:06.176 --> 01:32:10.464
-Man.
-I just don’t like this. I don’t like this.

1128
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.624
Yo. so where are we supposed
to be meeting at?

1129
01:32:17.584 --> 01:32:19.248
Please stop talking.

1130
01:32:20.064 --> 01:32:22.384
Everything is going to go exactly
how it's supposed to go.

1131
01:32:22.752 --> 01:32:25.472
You're making everyone nervous.

1132
01:32:28.992 --> 01:32:30.704
How're we supposed to know who Bishop is?

1133
01:32:31.184 --> 01:32:33.120
Bishop will be waiting for you at the park.

1134
01:32:34.528 --> 01:32:35.856
You say one more word.

1135
01:32:36.928 --> 01:32:39.552
they're going to need a preacher
and Bishop for your funeral.

1136
01:32:41.296 --> 01:32:42.640
I'm talking to him.

1137
01:33:17.776 --> 01:33:21.072
Okay. now remember
we already have your money.

1138
01:33:22.016 --> 01:33:24.352
You only get one question with Bishop.

1139
01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.728
Now. if you have any further questions.

1140
01:33:28.112 --> 01:33:30.128
then you have to make another appointment.

1141
01:33:43.216 --> 01:33:45.104
I love this song right here.

1142
01:33:48.288 --> 01:33:52.032
Just because it show you how easy
people can be fooled by appearance.

1143
01:33:53.952 --> 01:33:56.080
Nigger. I was surprised
that you guys want to see me.

1144
01:33:57.504 --> 01:34:00.960
I was even more surprised that this ain’t
about the feds closing in on your operation.

1145
01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:04.400
but you're here for your little girl.

1146
01:34:06.192 --> 01:34:08.272
Looking out for family. I like that.

1147
01:34:11.728 --> 01:34:13.792
Look at you so pretty.

1148
01:34:16.032 --> 01:34:17.920
I'm going to ask you a question.

1149
01:34:19.056 --> 01:34:22.800
Are you sure you want me
to tell you who killed Candy Connor?

1150
01:34:26.496 --> 01:34:28.512
How did you know that
I was going to ask you?

1151
01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.552
It's my job.
I'm good at it.

1152
01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:38.704
Yes. I want to know who
killed Candy more than anything.

1153
01:34:48.256 --> 01:34:52.432
You should never make a decision
based on hurt. anger.

1154
01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:53.824
and frustration.

1155
01:34:55.488 --> 01:34:58.192
I know you're hurt and I'm sorry
for your loss

1156
01:34:59.392 --> 01:35:03.968
but too many people come to me
with questions that have a very dark ending.

1157
01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:08.400
The Bible says the light shine
in the darkness

1158
01:35:08.832 --> 01:35:10.720
and the darkness comprehended it not.

1159
01:35:11.264 --> 01:35:12.624
What does that even mean?

1160
01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.736
You're thinking dark thoughts:
revenge. hate. murder.

1161
01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:19.072
It's like a cancer to your soul.

1162
01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.848
Darkness clouds everything.

1163
01:35:24.224 --> 01:35:26.912
I know that for you. Heaven.
that's the wrong question.

1164
01:35:27.696 --> 01:35:30.816
I don't care.
I want to know who killed my friend.

1165
01:35:33.296 --> 01:35:34.832
I'm sorry to hear that.

1166
01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:39.040
There is a better question.
but since that's your question.

1167
01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.744
it is Iesha Smith.

1168
01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:47.136
-Who the hell is Iesha Smith?
-Yo. cut all that.

1169
01:35:47.904 --> 01:35:49.184
Who is this chick?

1170
01:35:49.648 --> 01:35:51.728
That's not the way this works.

1171
01:35:52.176 --> 01:35:55.488
Come on. baby. you know the rules.
This is just business.

1172
01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:03.024
Yo. it's just business.

1173
01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:07.216
Thank you. Bishop. much appreciated.

1174
01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:10.624
-Thank him for what?
-I appreciate your business. Vega.

1175
01:36:12.576 --> 01:36:16.880
-Thank him for what?
-Hey. Q--

1176
01:36:17.008 --> 01:36:20.464
I mean Rodgers. if you ever need me.

1177
01:36:20.592 --> 01:36:23.072
it's only going to cost you
30 pieces of silver.

1178
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:29.696
I might take you up on that.
Hey. yo. Heaven.

1179
01:36:29.776 --> 01:36:32.384
Hey. hey. y'all. hey.
I got to go. y'all.

1180
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.408
Rodgers. I'm risking my job
by sitting up here talking to you.

1181
01:36:57.536 --> 01:36:59.200
The least you can do is hear me out.

1182
01:37:04.272 --> 01:37:06.016
Well. if it ain't old Jack.

1183
01:37:10.208 --> 01:37:12.832
I ain’t got time to deal with nothing
you got going on right now. bro.

1184
01:37:16.144 --> 01:37:19.712
It's about Heaven and Vega.

1185
01:37:20.176 --> 01:37:24.256
Listen. man. I'm sorry. all right?
I'm sorry about what happened.

1186
01:37:25.712 --> 01:37:27.616
That was years ago and this is now.

1187
01:37:28.784 --> 01:37:30.224
I'm trying to help people.

1188
01:37:38.816 --> 01:37:40.608
How you know about the case I'm in on?

1189
01:37:44.112 --> 01:37:46.512
Working on a task force
to try to take down the Bishop.

1190
01:37:47.152 --> 01:37:49.040
and all of a sudden. your name pops up.

1191
01:37:49.472 --> 01:37:52.240
Not to mention that I seen you
at the park with Vega and his crew.

1192
01:37:53.392 --> 01:37:55.712
Now you need to find a way
to get off this case

1193
01:37:56.464 --> 01:37:59.312
because. my brother.
you're way over your head on this one.

1194
01:38:00.112 --> 01:38:01.856
I ain't got to do nothing.

1195
01:38:02.432 --> 01:38:05.488
First. I ain't in over my head.
and second.

1196
01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:09.168
-I got everything under control.
-You're not listening to me.

1197
01:38:11.712 --> 01:38:14.080
Heaven is not who you think she is.

1198
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:18.160
The one that they call Ace is wanted
for murder in Mexico.

1199
01:38:19.728 --> 01:38:21.312
Vega.

1200
01:38:25.008 --> 01:38:26.864
Vega is something else all put together.

1201
01:38:28.688 --> 01:38:32.288
People that disappoint him.
they end up disappearing.

1202
01:38:35.856 --> 01:38:37.616
What's this about Heaven
ain't the person I think she is?

1203
01:38:37.712 --> 01:38:40.320
Please don't tell me you crossed
the line with this woman.

1204
01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.280
Have you read her site file?

1205
01:38:44.112 --> 01:38:45.792
This woman is damaged.

1206
01:38:46.192 --> 01:38:48.496
Now. I don't know why I thought you
will be different than any other guy

1207
01:38:48.544 --> 01:38:49.920
that came across her path.

1208
01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.552
The last thing I need to do
is to take any advice from you.

1209
01:38:57.408 --> 01:38:59.264
You took credit for all my work.

1210
01:39:00.016 --> 01:39:02.848
You're a fraud. Jack.
I mean you are a fraud.

1211
01:39:04.224 --> 01:39:08.416
It's only a matter of time before you fail
to live up to everybody's expectations.

1212
01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.432
Look. I didn’t have to come here
and do nothing.

1213
01:39:11.248 --> 01:39:12.880
I could have just let you get caught up
in the trap

1214
01:39:12.944 --> 01:39:14.976
they got setting up for you right now.

1215
01:39:15.856 --> 01:39:18.000
What I'm trying to--
Look at me when I talk to you.

1216
01:39:18.928 --> 01:39:20.048
Talk.

1217
01:39:22.816 --> 01:39:25.968
You win.
I'll leave it alone.

1218
01:39:28.672 --> 01:39:32.544
I'll leave it alone
but you will hear this.

1219
01:39:33.648 --> 01:39:36.144
I'm working with a task force
that's trying to take down the Bishop

1220
01:39:37.888 --> 01:39:41.344
and the next thing I know your name
is all over the underground sites.

1221
01:39:42.112 --> 01:39:44.752
There are people trying to kill you.
Rodgers.

1222
01:39:46.864 --> 01:39:49.008
Jack. what is it you want me to do?

1223
01:39:54.816 --> 01:39:58.112
I don't want you to do nothing.
Just be careful.

1224
01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:02.496
Vega has another right-hand man.

1225
01:40:03.168 --> 01:40:05.440
Three years ago.
I think his name is Stan Walker.

1226
01:40:06.464 --> 01:40:09.776
Well. he made a move on Heaven.

1227
01:40:10.752 --> 01:40:12.944
Now rumor has it that she snapped.

1228
01:40:14.688 --> 01:40:18.928
We believe that she killed him
and Vega covered it up.

1229
01:40:20.912 --> 01:40:24.640
Rumor. that's all you got?
A rumor?

1230
01:40:24.832 --> 01:40:26.496
That's all we should need.

1231
01:40:29.536 --> 01:40:31.152
You don't know Heaven like I do.

1232
01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.176
You just met her. man.

1233
01:40:34.288 --> 01:40:36.288
-She would never do anything to hurt somebody.
-You just met her.

1234
01:40:37.712 --> 01:40:44.224
Now trust. trust is a luxury that we both
can't afford in this line of business. brother.

1235
01:40:48.704 --> 01:40:50.512
Well. you listen to me real good brother.

1236
01:40:52.576 --> 01:40:54.880
If I see you again--

1237
01:40:59.968 --> 01:41:01.472
Oh. so now you Batman.

1238
01:41:02.064 --> 01:41:03.440
Now he Batman.

1239
01:41:04.736 --> 01:41:07.920
If anybody going to be Batman.
it's going to be me.

1240
01:41:15.968 --> 01:41:18.688
-Hey.
-Hey. I didn't think I'd see you so soon.

1241
01:41:19.136 --> 01:41:20.896
Do I need to turn myself in?

1242
01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:24.048
That lady. I was just trying to protect you.
I thought she was going to kill you.

1243
01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:27.456
No. it's not that just listen.

1244
01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:33.136
The woman you shot is connected
with some very. very bad people. okay?

1245
01:41:34.192 --> 01:41:37.504
I got to get you out of town because
they got your name listed as the shooter.

1246
01:41:37.696 --> 01:41:42.128
-What? How did they get my name?
-Listen. we can take care of that another time.

1247
01:41:42.688 --> 01:41:44.304
Right now. I got to get you out of town.

1248
01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:45.952
You got to go.

1249
01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:49.744
What? Rodger are you crazy?
I have an apartment.

1250
01:41:49.904 --> 01:41:53.040
-I have a job. I'm not going.
-No. no. no. They will kill you. Iesha.

1251
01:41:53.376 --> 01:41:56.080
They don't care about your new job
or your apartment.

1252
01:41:56.448 --> 01:41:58.656
They will kill you.
Here's some money.

1253
01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.816
All right. I got to get you out of town.

1254
01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.352
You got to leave now. all right?

1255
01:42:04.416 --> 01:42:05.200
Okay.

1256
01:42:10.416 --> 01:42:14.240
Hey. Q. that ain't the same woman
that you was with yesterday.

1257
01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:16.992
You get around. we need to talk.

1258
01:42:18.512 --> 01:42:20.064
We ain't got nothing
to talk about. Hector.

1259
01:42:20.768 --> 01:42:23.840
You're wrong about that. Q.
You took two things from me:

1260
01:42:24.144 --> 01:42:25.600
time and money.

1261
01:42:25.904 --> 01:42:27.488
Two things I can't replace.

1262
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:29.072
Now you got to die.

1263
01:42:29.312 --> 01:42:31.552
I got no problem with the woman.
she can go.

1264
01:42:31.952 --> 01:42:36.368
-Wait. are they the guys trying to kill me?
-No. that's somebody different.

1265
01:42:36.928 --> 01:42:38.240
They're trying to kill me.

1266
01:42:38.656 --> 01:42:41.024
Look. just stay down and stay calm.
all right?

1267
01:42:42.768 --> 01:42:46.992
Come on. Q.
You ain't got to make this difficult.

1268
01:42:47.808 --> 01:42:49.264
My friends and I don't have all day.

1269
01:42:49.472 --> 01:42:54.480
-Why do they keep calling you. Q?
-Here. just take this. Stay behind me.

1270
01:42:55.632 --> 01:42:59.456
-Time's up.
-What are you doing with a gun?

1271
01:43:07.376 --> 01:43:09.136
Start shooting. and stay behind me.

1272
01:44:13.296 --> 01:44:14.176
Vega.

1273
01:44:15.984 --> 01:44:20.208
Rodgers. no need to yell.
I'm right here.

1274
01:44:21.072 --> 01:44:23.328
Ace. put the gun down.
Tell her to put it down.

1275
01:44:23.408 --> 01:44:24.576
Ain't no need for this to get ugly.

1276
01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:29.680
Rodgers. you backstabbing snake.

1277
01:44:30.256 --> 01:44:31.616
you put the gun down.

1278
01:44:32.176 --> 01:44:33.920
I know you were going to do it Vega.

1279
01:44:35.344 --> 01:44:36.800
but I still got to take you in.

1280
01:44:37.712 --> 01:44:40.384
I know you got a job to do Rodgers.
so do I.

1281
01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:47.184
Things I did for this community.
for Heaven.

1282
01:44:47.712 --> 01:44:52.240
-Backup.
-Your mother. she's a special woman.

1283
01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:58.432
How about the people that overdosed
on the poison that you sold them?

1284
01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:02.448
-Vega. let me take him out.
-You better put that gun down.

1285
01:45:02.624 --> 01:45:03.456
Hold on. hold on.

1286
01:45:04.016 --> 01:45:09.760
In the Old Testament.
instead of two armies fighting

1287
01:45:10.016 --> 01:45:12.512
and spilling the blood of thousands.

1288
01:45:14.896 --> 01:45:17.696
two warriors will face off in battle.

1289
01:45:18.768 --> 01:45:22.832
The winner of that battle
was said to be chosen by God

1290
01:45:23.616 --> 01:45:28.224
to be the winner.
and that warrior would take the land.

1291
01:45:33.808 --> 01:45:36.512
-Think you could take him?
-I did it before.

1292
01:45:36.944 --> 01:45:39.792
-I'm sure I could take him.
-I have faith in you.

1293
01:45:41.472 --> 01:45:43.024
You will be God's instrument.

1294
01:45:46.992 --> 01:45:48.848
You want me to fight. Ace.

1295
01:45:50.288 --> 01:45:51.696
If Ace beat me.

1296
01:45:53.072 --> 01:45:54.592
y'all get to leave.

1297
01:45:56.528 --> 01:45:59.568
but if I beat Ace.
I get to take both of y'all in.

1298
01:45:59.808 --> 01:46:02.480
-No problem. right?
-You have my word on that.

1299
01:46:02.928 --> 01:46:05.888
I will walk out of here
with my head held up high.

1300
01:46:08.176 --> 01:46:10.768
I'm going to beat you
like you owe me child support.

1301
01:46:34.992 --> 01:46:37.744
Yo. who taught this chick how to fight?

1302
01:46:41.664 --> 01:46:45.936
-You got any more advice for me?
-Oh. no. .

1303
01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:48.384
That was a good one.
You got me good right there.

1304
01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.832
You win. Rodgers. you got it.

1305
01:47:01.328 --> 01:47:05.184
-That's not necessary. I could take him.
-Don't worry about it. Ace. You did good.

1306
01:47:05.632 --> 01:47:09.296
-We live to fight another day.
-You know what. Vega?

1307
01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:12.912
Who's side are you on?

1308
01:47:13.968 --> 01:47:16.096
I've seen you do good things to people

1309
01:47:17.504 --> 01:47:19.632
and I've seen you do bad things to people.

1310
01:47:20.816 --> 01:47:22.576
What's up. man?

1311
01:47:25.936 --> 01:47:28.256
Well. Rodgers.

1312
01:47:28.512 --> 01:47:31.840
I'd like to tell you that long story.
but I can't.

1313
01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:36.592
but growing up in the church.
I've realized that with or without me.

1314
01:47:37.536 --> 01:47:41.744
if people want to harm themselves.
they're going to do it.

1315
01:47:43.856 --> 01:47:46.048
-That's messed up.
-I gave you my word.

1316
01:47:49.136 --> 01:47:52.416
You can take me in. no questions asked.

1317
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.728
You know what. Vega?

1318
01:47:58.768 --> 01:47:59.872
I'm going to let you go.

1319
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.920
The only reason why I'm letting you go

1320
01:48:04.896 --> 01:48:06.848
it's because of how you
looked out for my mom.

1321
01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:11.072
Go on and get up out of here

1322
01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:14.448
and take she-man with you.

1323
01:48:15.632 --> 01:48:20.416
-Ace. get the stuff.
-Yes. Ace. get the stuff.

1324
01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.704
Conviction Roberts.
that's what you lack. conviction.

1325
01:48:30.128 --> 01:48:32.512
I'll give you something that you
can take back to your people.

1326
01:48:34.432 --> 01:48:40.096
Mr. Jackson. he's the one that gave
me all the names of the informants.

1327
01:48:40.976 --> 01:48:43.632
He's your little. how can I say it?

1328
01:48:44.896 --> 01:48:46.784
Snake in the Garden of Eden.

1329
01:48:47.696 --> 01:48:50.880
Come on.

1330
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:26.576
Hey. Will Smith. or if that's what
you want me to call you.

1331
01:49:26.688 --> 01:49:27.632
Hey. captain.

1332
01:49:27.744 --> 01:49:30.944
Hey. this whole fucking thing
didn't work out the way we wanted it to.

1333
01:49:32.016 --> 01:49:35.488
but people upstairs are happy
for the intel you were able to provide.

1334
01:49:38.784 --> 01:49:39.472
-Thank you. captain.
-I got you something.

1335
01:49:39.712 --> 01:49:42.528
-What you got for me?
-A promise is a promise.

1336
01:49:45.248 --> 01:49:48.304
-Really?
-I want you to know I watched this last night.

1337
01:49:49.024 --> 01:49:50.368
I still don't see it.

1338
01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.744
You look nothing like Will Smith.

1339
01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:57.776
Don't look at me that way.

1340
01:49:58.032 --> 01:50:00.592
Will Smith wishes he looked
this good as you do.

1341
01:50:00.784 --> 01:50:02.880
Well. I appreciate it. captain.

1342
01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.448
Hey. one thing though. I really got
something I got to talk to you about.

1343
01:50:08.912 --> 01:50:11.584
-it's serious. Can I talk to you?
-Absolutely.

1344
01:50:11.616 --> 01:50:12.256
Okay.

1345
01:50:30.944 --> 01:50:32.400
What are you doing?

1346
01:50:32.496 --> 01:50:34.864
First. I'm going to need you to cut
that light on and have a seat.

1347
01:50:38.864 --> 01:50:41.376
Put your gun on the table. slowly.

1348
01:50:41.808 --> 01:50:43.680
What makes you think I have a gun.
Rodgers?

1349
01:50:43.952 --> 01:50:46.528
Come on now. this is Youngstown.
everybody got a gun.

1350
01:50:47.616 --> 01:50:50.160
On the table. slowly.

1351
01:50:51.856 --> 01:50:58.352
Again. I have to ask. what are you
doing pointing a gun at a superior officer?

1352
01:50:59.856 --> 01:51:01.808
I can have your badge for that.

1353
01:51:02.928 --> 01:51:04.624
Vega dimed you out.

1354
01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:09.952
but what's crazy. though. is why you
ain't just let Vega know I was undercover?

1355
01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:12.944
You know that would have saved
you a lot of trouble. right?

1356
01:51:13.808 --> 01:51:15.328
Because you're a cop.

1357
01:51:17.264 --> 01:51:19.216
those others were a bunch of junkies

1358
01:51:19.504 --> 01:51:22.368
willing to kill themselves
and their families.

1359
01:51:23.312 --> 01:51:26.656
If a junkie dies. nobody cares.

1360
01:51:28.224 --> 01:51:32.352
but if a cop. there's always questions.

1361
01:51:34.464 --> 01:51:37.152
I guess that makes you
a bad guy with morals.

1362
01:51:38.912 --> 01:51:41.088
Three people are dead because of you.

1363
01:51:42.816 --> 01:51:46.864
No. Rodgers. three people are dead
because they were looking for drugs.

1364
01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:48.944
Now. look. you can say what you want.

1365
01:51:50.848 --> 01:51:53.872
but you know and I know
that no one is going to believe you.

1366
01:51:54.384 --> 01:51:56.144
I'm the most decorated cop

1367
01:51:56.384 --> 01:51:59.296
in this freak scene for the last 10 years.

1368
01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:05.104
You're some guy everyone felt sorry for
for getting shot.

1369
01:52:05.808 --> 01:52:09.008
-You couldn't even bring in Vega.
-Really?

1370
01:52:10.896 --> 01:52:12.784
What you got to say about that. captain?

1371
01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.320
I don't know by that.

1372
01:52:16.864 --> 01:52:18.128
I mean.

1373
01:52:18.496 --> 01:52:21.248
how do you not believe somebody
that looks like Will Smith?

1374
01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:25.952
When Rodgers first told me
that you were the rat.

1375
01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.352
I didn't believe him.

1376
01:52:29.008 --> 01:52:30.848
There's always more than one rat.

1377
01:52:35.312 --> 01:52:38.384
You guys have no idea
how high up this goes.

1378
01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:42.160
Vega is working for us.

1379
01:52:47.088 --> 01:52:49.968
You think people believe
that Vega is a big deal?

1380
01:52:51.872 --> 01:52:55.840
People outside of Ohio
have never heard of him.

1381
01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:03.376
Now I have times. dates. names.
I have it all.

1382
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:06.880
no one is-

1383
01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:24.096
-You good. captain?
-Yes. I'm good.

1384
01:53:24.352 --> 01:53:25.536
It was a hit.

1385
01:53:26.624 --> 01:53:28.416
They knew he was going to talk.

1386
01:53:28.928 --> 01:53:31.088
Okay. all right.
Hey. we got to get out of here.

1387
01:53:31.152 --> 01:53:33.984
Yes. this is nowhere near over.

1388
01:53:37.744 --> 01:53:40.720
-Hello. Officer Rodgers.
-Yes. this is Rodgers. what's going on?

1389
01:53:40.848 --> 01:53:44.272
It's Detective Reyes.
Vega and Ace got away.

1390
01:53:45.136 --> 01:53:47.072
-They're on the run.
-Yes. I heard about that.

1391
01:53:47.184 --> 01:53:48.688
Now we have to bring his daughter in.

1392
01:53:48.848 --> 01:53:51.744
-You mean Samantha Owens?
-Yes. Samantha Owens.

1393
01:53:51.808 --> 01:53:54.720
I don't understand. Heaven don't have
anything to do with Vega's operation.

1394
01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:58.816
Listen. if we bring her in.
Vega will have no choice but to come back.

1395
01:53:59.008 --> 01:54:00.544
I'm telling you Heaven is innocent.

1396
01:54:00.576 --> 01:54:02.544
She don't have nothing to do
with Vega's operation.

1397
01:54:02.768 --> 01:54:04.640
We have a warrant for her arrest.

1398
01:54:05.184 --> 01:54:06.416
just enough to bring her in.

1399
01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:09.968
Listen. either you do it. or we will.

1400
01:54:10.464 --> 01:54:12.960
Okay. Reyes.
I'll do it.

1401
01:54:13.632 --> 01:54:16.352
It's my case.
I'll bring her in myself.

1402
01:54:16.816 --> 01:54:19.600
-She won't be expecting me.
-Do it now. Rodgers.

1403
01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:22.400
-Do it now.
-Okay. I'm going right now.

1404
01:54:22.896 --> 01:54:25.584
I have a squad waiting for you
when you bring her out.

1405
01:54:25.968 --> 01:54:27.536
I'm on my way.
I'll bring her in.

1406
01:54:46.048 --> 01:54:47.216
Samantha Owens.

1407
01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:49.680
I'm so glad you're here.

1408
01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:52.464
You never told me if you're not
going to play cards or not.

1409
01:54:58.256 --> 01:54:59.840
You are under arrest. Samantha.

1410
01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:03.920
You have the right to remain silent.

1411
01:55:17.008 --> 01:55:21.104
If you can't afford an attorney.
the court will appoint you with one.

1412
01:55:23.536 --> 01:55:25.328
Please. put your hands behind
your back. Samantha.

1413
01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.352
No.

1414
01:55:36.048 --> 01:55:37.744
Samantha. please. put
your hand behind your back.

1415
01:55:37.792 --> 01:55:39.232
So this was all a lie?

1416
01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:41.856
I must say. Rodgers.
I am so pleased with your progress.

1417
01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:47.552
I don't feel like
I've made any progress. doc.

1418
01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:52.208
The only good thing that happened to me
these last two weeks is my mother

1419
01:57:52.272 --> 01:57:53.648
is getting a lot better.

1420
01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:56.320
I still don't like my sister.

1421
01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:59.200
Iesha is still stalking me.

1422
01:58:01.664 --> 01:58:04.320
Hector got released out of jail.
some technicality.

1423
01:58:05.968 --> 01:58:08.336
Vega is on the run.

1424
01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:11.024
and Heaven never wants to see me again.

1425
01:58:11.792 --> 01:58:14.480
Wow. that's a lot.

1426
01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:17.856
That's the strange thing about progress.

1427
01:58:18.272 --> 01:58:22.304
when you make it.
never really seems like it.

1428
01:58:23.856 --> 01:58:26.848
I'm not supposed to give you
the answers.

1429
01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.792
but since this will be our last session.

1430
01:58:29.888 --> 01:58:31.328
I'm going to make an exception.

1431
01:58:33.504 --> 01:58:37.088
Life is always complicated.

1432
01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:41.488
This isn't some TV show where
everything's going to be wrapped up

1433
01:58:41.568 --> 01:58:44.160
in a tiny little bow in an hour.

1434
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:51.376
Many people waste their entire lives
chasing questions with no answers.

1435
01:58:52.832 --> 01:58:55.440
-Take a deep breath.
-

1436
01:58:59.904 --> 01:59:03.712
Now. I want you to think about
what's important. really important.

1437
01:59:05.856 --> 01:59:08.976
and then just live.

1438
01:59:11.856 --> 01:59:14.320
-Live?
-Yes. Just live.

1439
01:59:16.496 --> 01:59:17.248
How?

1440
01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.168
I've made so many enemies. doc.

1441
01:59:27.168 --> 01:59:28.640
I don't want to do this anymore.

1442
01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:32.720
You don't want to do what?

1443
01:59:34.912 --> 01:59:36.960
I have strong feelings for Heaven.

1444
01:59:39.856 --> 01:59:42.704
Do you have feelings.

1445
01:59:43.136 --> 01:59:46.736
or is it the person you're pretending
to be that has the feelings?

1446
01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:48.624
At this point in my life.

1447
01:59:50.528 --> 01:59:51.856
I really don't even know.

1448
01:59:55.264 --> 01:59:57.696
Well. then I think figuring
that out in your mind

1449
01:59:57.776 --> 02:00:00.288
will be a great place
for you to focus on.

1450
02:00:03.456 --> 02:00:04.992
I really appreciate you. doc.

1451
02:00:05.888 --> 02:00:07.392
Thank you for being patient with me.

1452
02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:10.160
You're welcome. I saw I. Robot.

1453
02:00:10.576 --> 02:00:11.824
-You did it?
-I did it.

1454
02:00:12.128 --> 02:00:16.880
-How do you like it?
-You look nothing like Will Smith.

1455
02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:25.328
Thank you.

1456
02:00:26.544 --> 02:00:29.568
There's one thing I wanted to say
to you and I wanted to apologize about.

1457
02:00:29.648 --> 02:00:30.720
What is it?

1458
02:00:31.712 --> 02:00:35.824
You look nothing like Halle Berry.
You look way better than Halle Berry.

1459
02:00:36.272 --> 02:00:38.032
Give me five.

1460
02:00:39.872 --> 02:00:42.160
-See you around.
-See you around. doc.
