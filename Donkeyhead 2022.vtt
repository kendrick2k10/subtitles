the Guru’s pure words.

21
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.791

First. let’s move everything.

34
00:30:05.458 --> 00:30:09.958
Pick up that table.

them to you. Here you go.

37
00:41:15.291 --> 00:41:17.166
Where did you all go?

38
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.583
We went to a restaurant.

39
00:41:19.666 --> 00:41:22.666
What’s wrong with her?
Why is she falling everywhere?

40
00:41:24.333 --> 00:41:27.125
Well. then keep going to
restaurants to eat. why don’t you!

41
00:41:43.708 --> 00:41:47.375
Auntie. shall I make us some tea?
With a bit of ginger?

42
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.291
Ok. three minutes.

43
00:46:47.708 --> 00:46:48.583
God protect you.

44
00:47:22.541 --> 00:47:24.333
Auntie. I’ll do that.

45
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:35.916
I used to always
take care of your father.

46
00:47:37.083 --> 00:47:41.250
He used to remind me
of a little doll.

47
00:47:41.333 --> 00:47:45.208
You remind me so much of him.

48
00:47:45.291 --> 00:47:48.958
You’re such a good boy.

49
00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:27.000
Girl. get married. why are you
determined to kill your father?

50
01:04:53.583 --> 01:04:57.875
Cover your head.

51
01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:59.333
No! Not in front of your father!

52
01:08:59.416 --> 01:09:01.166
Why are you fighting
in front of your father?

53
01:11:40.458 --> 01:11:44.125
Parminder. what is this
nonsense I am hearing?

54
01:11:44.208 --> 01:11:47.583
Tell me. is this true?
What nonsense is this?

55
01:11:47.666 --> 01:11:50.916
What is this nonsense?

56
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.666
What is going on here?
I don’t understand this family.

57
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.416
Amrit. bring him a pillow.

58
01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.791
Poor thing. look how uncomfortable
he is. with his bare arms.

59
01:19:22.875 --> 01:19:26.000
This nurse doesn’t
do anything all day!

60
01:19:26.083 --> 01:19:30.583
I told them. children do the prayers.

61
01:19:30.666 --> 01:19:34.000
Look. my brother is now conscious!

62
01:19:34.083 --> 01:19:39.041
If we pray with a pure heart.
God will always hear us.

63
01:19:39.125 --> 01:19:40.416
See. he heard me.
