for a long while.

76
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.333

I'd pick her up in the morning.

You know we don't say that.

120
00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:42.625

I have to tell you.

It's fine. Really.

You still working for my dad?

161
00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:48.042
Of course. Yeah.
I'm-I'm his right hand man.

weird for you

Or. uh...

You won't find any here.

Sorry. I didn't...

184
00:12:52.708 --> 00:12:55.792
-No. it's okay.
-Are you two back together?

185
00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.792
No! No. we're...

186
00:12:57.917 --> 00:13:00.292
He was just so close
to my family. so...

187
00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.125
Right.
I'm so sorry.

188
00:13:05.792 --> 00:13:07.625
I heard about Julie.

189
00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:10.083
News travels fast around here.

190
00:13:10.167 --> 00:13:13.958
Um. I've been actually
working with her

191
00:13:13.958 --> 00:13:15.375
for the last few months.

192
00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:17.125
I didn't know that.

193
00:13:17.208 --> 00:13:19.458
Just helping with some admin
stuff at the store.

194
00:13:19.583 --> 00:13:22.208
You've always been good at
helping people get organized.

195
00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:23.667
[laughs]

196
00:13:23.792 --> 00:13:25.375
I actually have
something to give you.

197
00:13:25.458 --> 00:13:28.292
If maybe you can stop by
the store sometime this week?

198
00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:29.917
Of course.

199
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.542
Okay. Great. It'll give us
a chance to catch up.

200
00:13:33.542 --> 00:13:35.042
I'd like that.

201
00:13:39.542 --> 00:13:41.375
-See you soon.
-See ya.

00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:45.292
[mellow music]

203
00:13:49.083 --> 00:13:52.250
-Goodnight. Oliver.
-Night. Kay.

204
00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:56.208
Hey. uh. thank you so much for
getting us out of here today.

205
00:13:56.292 --> 00:13:57.750
We both needed it.

206
00:13:57.875 --> 00:14:00.250
You always prefer a
distraction when you're upset.

207
00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:01.417
I haven't forgotten.

208
00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.333
Oliver...

209
00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:08.375
about everything that
happened last year.

210
00:14:08.458 --> 00:14:10.125
Hey. No need to do this now.

211
00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:12.917
You've got enough on your plate

212
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.708
without having to worry
about that too.

213
00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:16.208
Thank you.

214
00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:20.542
Everything's forgiven. okay?

215
00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:27.500
Thank you. Oliver.

[mellow music]

217
00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:35.958
I. I needed that.

218
00:14:36.833 --> 00:14:38.500
Me. too. [chuckles]

219
00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:41.458
Talk soon.

-Extra butter?
-Of course.

223
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.250
Thank you.

224
00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:11.375
I'm so glad you're here.

225
00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:15.333
Things have been...
hard recently.

226
00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:17.625
Fighting?

227
00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:25.333
I don't remember them fighting.

228
00:15:27.833 --> 00:15:30.375
Yeah. well. they do now.

229
00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:35.250
Or they did.

230
00:15:36.917 --> 00:15:39.542
[indistinct TV chatter]

231
00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:46.625
Here.

232
00:15:50.875 --> 00:15:52.292
It's okay.

[Paul] I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean...

238
00:16:35.875 --> 00:16:38.208
[sobs]
Please forgive me.

-[thud]
-Oh. shoot.

240
00:16:52.792 --> 00:16:54.000
What are you doing?

241
00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:56.375
I was just going
to the bathroom.

242
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.250
How long have
you been standing there?

243
00:16:59.833 --> 00:17:01.875
How long?

244
00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:03.542
What did you hear?

245
00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:05.750
Nothing.

246
00:17:05.833 --> 00:17:07.375
[Brody]
Time to go to bed. dad.

247
00:17:10.958 --> 00:17:16.250
I don't need you of all people
tell-telling me what to do.

248
00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:21.250
Come on.
I'll take you upstairs.

249
00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:28.500
Goodnight. Wren.

250
00:17:44.208 --> 00:17:46.167
I'm done for the night.

251
00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:51.625
I've never seen him...
like that.

252
00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:56.292
He's been drinking more lately.

253
00:17:57.292 --> 00:17:58.667
How long's that been going on?

254
00:18:00.542 --> 00:18:02.125
Since you left.

255
00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:07.458
[sighs] He'll-he'll be fine
in the morning.

256
00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:12.667
Thank you.... for everything.

257

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:47.333
Hey.

261
00:18:47.375 --> 00:18:49.792
Were you at dinner with him?

262
00:18:49.875 --> 00:18:53.208
Ah... with. with who?

263
00:18:53.375 --> 00:18:56.292
My Dad. Last night.

264
00:18:56.292 --> 00:18:59.208
[chuckles]
Oh. yeah. Why do you ask?

265
00:19:00.917 --> 00:19:03.500
He's just been acting...
strange.

266
00:19:04.792 --> 00:19:06.833
Well... [laughs]

267
00:19:06.833 --> 00:19:12.083
Isn't this your field? Isn't
that what trauma does to people?

268
00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:13.625
You're right.

269
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.792
Goodnight. Oliver.

270
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.667
Sweet dreams.

[mellow music]

272
00:19:34.417 --> 00:19:35.917
Morning.

273
00:19:38.042 --> 00:19:40.167
Smells good.

274
00:19:40.167 --> 00:19:42.417
Gluten-free protein pancakes.

275
00:19:42.542 --> 00:19:44.833
What? No more sugary cereal?

276
00:19:44.875 --> 00:19:46.958
She's been performing
better since we started her

277
00:19:47.042 --> 00:19:49.083
on a high protein diet.

278
00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:51.542
Well done.

279
00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:53.917
How did you sleep?

280
00:19:53.917 --> 00:19:57.625
Bad. I kept having nightmares.

281
00:19:57.708 --> 00:19:59.542
It would be unusual
if you didn't. Kay.

282
00:20:01.625 --> 00:20:04.708
And it's okay for your psyche
to vent short term in that way.

283
00:20:04.792 --> 00:20:07.833
It's just your brain
trying to find order.

284
00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:10.458
I actually have an exercise that
might really help with that.

285
00:20:10.458 --> 00:20:12.458
She's been through enough
with out having to relive it.

286
00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:15.667
Well. that's not what it's
about. It'll be good for her.

287
00:20:15.875 --> 00:20:18.750
You don't know what's good
for her. Not anymore.

288
00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:21.000
Hello! I'm sitting right here.

289
00:20:21.083 --> 00:20:22.792
Kayla. why don't you
go upstairs?

290
00:20:22.875 --> 00:20:24.125
I'm not a kid anymore.

291
00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.958
I can handle whatever
you're gonna say.

292
00:20:26.042 --> 00:20:26.917
Fine.

293
00:20:28.542 --> 00:20:31.250
She's can't handle it.
Not right now.

294
00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:33.500
Believe me.
I know what's best for her.

295
00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:35.167
-So do I.
-Not anymore.

296
00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:37.333
I know what's best for me.

297
00:20:37.458 --> 00:20:38.917
-Kayla--
-I do. Brody.

298
00:20:41.417 --> 00:20:45.208
Well. I guess I'm just
the pancake chef then.

299
00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:50.542
Thank you. chef.

300
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.333

head out for a bit.

301
00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:58.333

little later.

-Hey.

306
00:21:37.042 --> 00:21:39.167
I. uh. wanted to return this

307
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.542
and-and bring you
a thank you coffee.

308
00:21:40.625 --> 00:21:42.875
But. uh. the cardigan drank it.

I'm so sorry. Oliver.

311
00:21:46.208 --> 00:21:47.917
I-I-I could have cleaned up

312
00:21:48.042 --> 00:21:49.917
if I knew you were coming.

313
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.542
Let me fix this. I know how
much you love this sweater.

much redecorating.

You-you got great taste.

00:22:03.583 --> 00:22:05.375
Is the stain remover still
on the ensuite sink?

Um. hey. hey. hey...

00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:11.208
Let's. uh. let's not worry
about it. Okay?

320
00:22:11.208 --> 00:22:13.917
-I'll wash it later.
-It'll stain.

321
00:22:13.917 --> 00:22:15.750
How about...

322
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.042
How about I make you
a coffee. Huh?

323
00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:20.458
I won't even spill it.

It's been fun.

327
00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:34.500
Yeah.

328
00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:36.375
Hey. We should grab a bite.

329
00:22:36.375 --> 00:22:37.917
While you're in town.

330
00:22:41.875 --> 00:22:45.500
We could talk. Figure out
where things went wrong.

331
00:22:45.583 --> 00:22:48.542
I should... get back to Kayla.

332
00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:50.542
Thank you for the coffee.

Thank you for...
still being there for me.

for you.

[music continues]

338
00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:40.375
So art therapy
doesn't just let you

339
00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:42.292
express yourself
and your feelings.

340
00:23:42.375 --> 00:23:44.333
It helps you uncover parts
of yourself

341
00:23:44.458 --> 00:23:47.458
that even you
didn't know existed.

342
00:23:47.542 --> 00:23:50.708
Like whatever's hiding
in my nightmares.

343
00:23:50.833 --> 00:23:52.833
We're going to start with
something more positive today.

344
00:23:52.958 --> 00:23:54.500
So you're going
to draw the place

345
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.625
where you feel
the safest in the world.

346
00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:09.542
I'm coming up blank.
Where's yours?

347
00:24:21.458 --> 00:24:23.500
[Wren] Her bedroom
stayed with me.

348
00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:31.625
Your safe space is so close by.

349
00:24:31.708 --> 00:24:33.208
Yeah.

350
00:24:33.375 --> 00:24:35.083
I haven't been inside
since I was a kid.

351
00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:37.958
Since she died.

352
00:24:37.958 --> 00:24:41.542
Is it weird with it
being right there?

353
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.583
It's probably part of why
I ran away from here.

354
00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:50.958
What did she die of?

355
00:24:51.083 --> 00:24:53.875
Mom and dad said
there was an accident at home.

356
00:24:54.042 --> 00:24:55.875
What kind of accident?

357
00:24:56.042 --> 00:24:57.917
I don't know.

358
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.792
[Kayla] Really?

359
00:24:59.958 --> 00:25:03.500
Yeah. I-I didn't know
how to ask.

360
00:25:03.583 --> 00:25:05.542
And I didn't wanna give
the impression that I wasn't

361
00:25:05.625 --> 00:25:08.375
happy with the life
they gave me by adopting me.

362
00:25:08.542 --> 00:25:10.333
That's the same reason
Brody never asks

363
00:25:10.417 --> 00:25:12.083
them about our birth parents.

364
00:25:13.792 --> 00:25:17.667
What about you?
You talked to them about it?

365
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.958
Of course I do.
It would kill me not to know!

366
00:25:25.667 --> 00:25:28.125
So. what are you going to draw?

367
00:25:31.542 --> 00:25:33.000
I'm gonna draw you.

368
00:25:34.417 --> 00:25:35.750
You're my safe space.

369
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.167
[instrumental music]

370
00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:02.792
-Hey. you.
-Hi.

371
00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:09.042
Did you stop by
mom's shop today?

372
00:26:12.042 --> 00:26:13.958
No.

373
00:26:13.958 --> 00:26:15.792
[Paul] Why?

374
00:26:15.875 --> 00:26:17.458
You weren't at the store.

375
00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:19.542
Um...

376
00:26:19.542 --> 00:26:20.875
[scoffs]

377
00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:22.708
I was at the office all day.

378
00:26:22.792 --> 00:26:25.208
Then I-I went to the
funeral home.

379
00:26:29.167 --> 00:26:32.833
I'm glad to see that you're
spending time with Oliver again.

380
00:26:35.083 --> 00:26:38.667
I'd like to go to the funeral
home to see mom tomorrow.

381
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.292
I wanna say goodbye.

382
00:26:42.042 --> 00:26:44.292
Oh. Wren. uh...

383
00:26:44.375 --> 00:26:45.708
I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry.

384
00:26:45.792 --> 00:26:49.208
We. we had her cremated
this afternoon.

385
00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:50.792
What?

386
00:26:50.792 --> 00:26:52.333
[Paul] The medical examiner
declared

387
00:26:52.458 --> 00:26:55.542
her death accidental
th-this morning.

388
00:26:55.625 --> 00:26:57.292
I needed to put her to rest.

389
00:26:57.375 --> 00:26:59.250
Without even telling me?

390
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.792
This is what she wanted.

391
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.792
She was my mother!

392
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:07.333
Wren...

393
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.833
Look. I'm-I'm sorry.

394
00:27:14.042 --> 00:27:15.958
[grunting]

395
00:27:21.333 --> 00:27:24.250
[breathing heavily]

396
00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:38.625
[intense music]

397
00:27:50.625 --> 00:27:53.375
[pencil scratching]

398
00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:08.875
[music continues]

399
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.750
[pencil scratching]

400
00:28:36.542 --> 00:28:38.167
[music continues]

401
00:28:55.708 --> 00:28:58.792
[suspenseful music]

402
00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:03.917
Dad?

403
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.333
Dad?

404
00:29:26.208 --> 00:29:28.375
[music continues]

405
00:29:39.542 --> 00:29:41.958
[intense music]

406
00:29:56.042 --> 00:29:58.167
I think Wren is
going to be a problem.

407
00:30:07.167 --> 00:30:08.875
[bell chimes]

408
00:30:19.875 --> 00:30:21.292
[door closes]

409
00:30:22.875 --> 00:30:25.333
[instrumental music]

410
00:30:28.667 --> 00:30:30.333
Oh! Hey. Wren!

411
00:30:30.417 --> 00:30:32.750
Hey! Did I just see
my next door neighbor?

412
00:30:32.833 --> 00:30:36.583
Mia? Yeah. she just left.
She needed some files.

413
00:30:36.708 --> 00:30:40.000
-Files?
-She's co-owner.

414
00:30:40.125 --> 00:30:42.250
Ju-Julie brought her on
about six months ago.

415
00:30:42.333 --> 00:30:44.500
No one told me that.

416
00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:46.542
-Tea?
-Sure.

417
00:30:48.167 --> 00:30:50.625
Yeah. Julie brought me
in to help out

418
00:30:50.708 --> 00:30:52.333
and bring some order
to the chaos.

419
00:30:52.458 --> 00:30:54.042
Chaos?

420
00:30:54.042 --> 00:30:57.125
I don't think Mia is the
best business person.

421
00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:59.917
Then why'd my mom bring her in?

422
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.750
She must've had her reasons.

423
00:31:01.875 --> 00:31:04.667
Oh. before I forget.
first order of business...

424
00:31:04.792 --> 00:31:06.375
These are for you.

425
00:31:08.083 --> 00:31:09.500
Julie said should anything
ever happen.

426
00:31:09.583 --> 00:31:11.208
to give the keys only you.

427
00:31:11.333 --> 00:31:13.167
She owns the building.
you know.

428
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.083
She wanted you
to have this place.

429
00:31:19.875 --> 00:31:22.833
Doesn't Mia have keys?

430
00:31:22.958 --> 00:31:25.500
Your mom asked her to hand hers'
over a few weeks ago.

431
00:31:25.625 --> 00:31:27.208
Really?

432
00:31:27.208 --> 00:31:30.333
I actually wanted to mention
something to you.

433
00:31:30.417 --> 00:31:34.583
A few days before the accident.
Julie said something strange.

434
00:31:34.708 --> 00:31:38.000
She told me she found out
Mia had stole from her.

435
00:31:40.042 --> 00:31:42.875
But she didn't mentioned what.

436
00:31:42.958 --> 00:31:44.875
So anything missing
from the shop?

437
00:31:44.958 --> 00:31:47.667
Not that I could find.

438
00:31:47.708 --> 00:31:48.833
Do you have
a bookkeeping records?

439
00:31:48.833 --> 00:31:50.750
Of course.
It's in the office.

440
00:31:50.833 --> 00:31:53.000
I'll have Brody look these over.

441
00:31:53.125 --> 00:31:55.542
Oh. second order of business.

442
00:31:55.542 --> 00:31:56.875
Are you gonna tell me
what happened with Oliver

443
00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:58.958
that day or not?

444
00:32:00.792 --> 00:32:02.375
I'll tell you.

445
00:32:02.458 --> 00:32:04.625
but I'm gonna need something
stronger than tea.

446
00:32:04.625 --> 00:32:07.000
Hmm. I have just the thing.

447
00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:10.042
[Gina] The whole town
was so shocked

448
00:32:10.167 --> 00:32:12.333
when you left Oliver
at the altar.

449
00:32:12.417 --> 00:32:14.750
My family included.

450
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.042
So why'd you do it?

451
00:32:16.125 --> 00:32:20.000
Ever since Julie and Paul
adopted me. I...

452
00:32:20.042 --> 00:32:23.458
sort of felt like I was
living someone else's life.

453
00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:26.917
I was the daughter
they could never have.

454
00:32:26.917 --> 00:32:29.667
but I was already
someone else's daughter.

455
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.292
Looks like a lot of pressure.

456
00:32:34.375 --> 00:32:35.917
Julie and Paul
are the ones who set me up

457
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.667
with Oliver in the first place.

458
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.917
[scoffs]
I didn't know that.

459
00:32:40.042 --> 00:32:43.375
Yeah. He was an up-and-coming
architect at the firm.

460
00:32:43.375 --> 00:32:46.167
They. they thought the
company would stay

461
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.667
in the family
when we got married.

462
00:32:48.792 --> 00:32:52.000
The arrangement was perfect.
For them.

463
00:32:52.083 --> 00:32:54.208
So they pushed you into it?

464
00:32:54.292 --> 00:32:56.583
No. I wouldn't say that either.

465
00:32:58.125 --> 00:33:00.042
I really did love him.

466
00:33:04.042 --> 00:33:06.125
But something didn't
feel right between us.

467
00:33:07.708 --> 00:33:11.000
So you hanging out with Oliver
the other day...

468
00:33:12.875 --> 00:33:15.417
He still feels like
home somehow.

469
00:33:18.375 --> 00:33:21.833
Maybe there's a chance
you'll rekindle things?

470
00:33:21.875 --> 00:33:23.375
I have missed him.

471
00:33:27.167 --> 00:33:31.375
But if things were reversed
and he left me at the altar...

472
00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:34.333
I don't know if I'd be able
to forgive him.

473
00:33:34.333 --> 00:33:36.750
So...

474
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:39.500
I can't imagine how
he feels about me right now.

475
00:33:45.708 --> 00:33:47.375
[dog barking in distance]

476
00:33:49.542 --> 00:33:52.042
[birds chirping]

477
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.750
[knock on door]

478
00:33:59.417 --> 00:34:00.542
[door opens]

479
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.250
Hi.

480
00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:06.500
Hello.

481
00:34:06.625 --> 00:34:09.000
I was just in the middle
of preparing canapes

482
00:34:09.042 --> 00:34:10.125
for Julie's wake tonight.

483
00:34:10.208 --> 00:34:12.333
Oh. that's very kind.

484
00:34:14.542 --> 00:34:18.042
Is there something
I can do for you. Wren?

485
00:34:18.042 --> 00:34:21.000
I'm. um. uh...

486
00:34:21.083 --> 00:34:24.000
I'm collecting memories
of mom from her friends

487
00:34:24.083 --> 00:34:26.167
that we can share
at the wake tonight.

488
00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.167
I was hoping you had a memory.

489
00:34:29.875 --> 00:34:32.417
What a nice idea.
Please. come in.

490
00:34:34.583 --> 00:34:36.708
[suspenseful music]

491
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:42.958
It's very nice of you
to do all this.

492
00:34:42.958 --> 00:34:45.000
You two must have been close.

493
00:34:45.125 --> 00:34:46.833
We didn't know
each other very long.

494
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.042
but we became instant friends.

495
00:34:50.042 --> 00:34:53.208
And you moved in here
about a year ago?

496
00:34:53.292 --> 00:34:57.167
Yes. I was so excited
when I came back on the market.

497
00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.042
I think we became
such fast friends

498
00:35:00.167 --> 00:35:03.167
because Julie was feeling
really lonely at the time.

499
00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:06.333
We met shortly after
your would-be wedding.

500
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.667
Glad you could be there for her.

501
00:35:09.708 --> 00:35:14.333
Yes. well. someone had to be.
She was in a bad way.

502
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:20.583
I understand she. uh. brought
you into the plant shop.

503
00:35:20.583 --> 00:35:22.833
Yes. she was looking for
a breath of fresh air

504
00:35:22.875 --> 00:35:26.875
and I have experience in
marketing so it was a great fit.

505
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.333
Hmm. How was business going?

506
00:35:29.417 --> 00:35:32.625
Hmm. we had our
growing pains at first.

507
00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:37.375
but things were really starting
to pick up just before she...

508
00:35:37.375 --> 00:35:39.750
So you really enjoyed
working together then?

509
00:35:39.875 --> 00:35:41.458
Very much.

510
00:35:41.542 --> 00:35:45.083
Would you like me to share
a memory from that time?

511
00:35:45.083 --> 00:35:48.292
-For who?
-For the wake...

512
00:35:48.375 --> 00:35:50.500
For the the memories
you're gathering.

513
00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:52.542
Yes. please.

514
00:35:52.542 --> 00:35:54.458
Once we were working
late waiting

515
00:35:54.458 --> 00:35:55.833
on an order of rare
philodendrons--

516
00:35:55.917 --> 00:35:57.667
[telephone ringing]

517
00:36:03.042 --> 00:36:04.667
Would you please excuse me?

518
00:36:04.667 --> 00:36:06.250
Of course.

519
00:36:09.917 --> 00:36:11.708
[Mia] Hello.

520
00:36:11.792 --> 00:36:13.708
Are you kidding me?

521
00:36:13.833 --> 00:36:15.250
You're sure?

522
00:36:16.708 --> 00:36:17.792
This is ridiculous.

523
00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:21.333
She owned the building.

524
00:36:21.417 --> 00:36:23.333
I'm her business partner.

525
00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:27.208
[indistinct chatter]

526
00:36:28.333 --> 00:36:30.833
[intense music]

527
00:36:58.333 --> 00:37:00.833
[mellow music]

528
00:37:28.708 --> 00:37:30.750
[intense music]

529
00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:34.292
What are you doing up here?

530
00:37:46.792 --> 00:37:50.542
[gasps] Dad.

531
00:37:50.542 --> 00:37:53.250
What were you doing at Mia's?
Why are you running?

532
00:37:53.333 --> 00:37:56.208
I just realized
I forgot my phone.

533
00:37:56.333 --> 00:37:57.958
We were just going
through some things

534
00:37:57.958 --> 00:37:59.500
for mom's wake tonight.

535
00:38:01.833 --> 00:38:02.833
Oh!

536
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.458
How did my birth mother die?

537
00:38:06.542 --> 00:38:09.583
Why-why are you asking about her
after all these years?

538
00:38:09.667 --> 00:38:13.375
I guess. being in my old house
brought up some memories.

539
00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:15.792
You were just a
little girl then.

540
00:38:15.792 --> 00:38:18.375
You-you don't even have
memories from that time.

541
00:38:18.375 --> 00:38:20.333
So tell me what happened.

542
00:38:20.375 --> 00:38:22.250
-She died in an accident.
-What kind of accident?

543
00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:24.542
It's your mother's wake tonight.

544
00:38:24.667 --> 00:38:27.375
It's not the right time to be
picking at old wounds.

545
00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:40.667
[water running]

546
00:38:47.417 --> 00:38:50.625
-You all right?
-Yeah.

547
00:38:50.708 --> 00:38:53.667
-Hey. would you do me a favor?
-Sure.

548
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.333
Those are the files
from mom's business.

549
00:38:56.458 --> 00:38:58.167
Would you take
a look over them

550
00:38:58.208 --> 00:39:01.167
and tell me what exactly is
happening with the money?

551
00:39:01.292 --> 00:39:03.708
Is there anything
I should be looking out for?

552
00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:06.458
Gina told me that
mom accused Mia

553
00:39:06.542 --> 00:39:08.958
of stealing something from her
just before she died.

554
00:39:09.042 --> 00:39:11.167
You want to see
if there's any proof of that.

555
00:39:11.208 --> 00:39:12.875
I'll take a look and see...

556
00:39:12.875 --> 00:39:13.958
[Kayla screams]

557
00:39:15.125 --> 00:39:17.667
[intense music]

558
00:39:19.583 --> 00:39:21.792
-Are you okay?
-What happened?

559
00:39:21.875 --> 00:39:23.417
What is this?

560
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.500
-It's...
-Why would you draw this?

561
00:39:25.625 --> 00:39:27.208
What did I say about making her
relive her trauma?

562
00:39:27.333 --> 00:39:29.458
-I was trying to work through--
-I knew this was a bad idea.

563
00:39:29.542 --> 00:39:30.833
I know what I'm doing. Brody!

564
00:39:30.917 --> 00:39:32.500
Mom is not just some
twisted art project.

565
00:39:32.583 --> 00:39:34.792
Just leave me alone.

566
00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:38.667
Kayla...

567
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.250
[mellow music]

568
00:39:43.375 --> 00:39:46.208
-Let me try to explain.
-I said. leave me alone!

569
00:39:46.292 --> 00:39:49.875
You heard her.
She needs some space. From you.

570
00:39:54.292 --> 00:39:55.833
[grunts]

571
00:40:04.125 --> 00:40:06.625
[suspenseful music]

572
00:40:14.792 --> 00:40:16.375
Come in.

573
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.542
[Wren] Thanks so much for
inviting me in. Mrs. Jenkins.

574
00:40:21.667 --> 00:40:23.750
[Florence]
Please. call me Florence.

575
00:40:26.542 --> 00:40:29.625
I wanted to ask you
about my next door neighbor Mia.

576
00:40:29.708 --> 00:40:32.000
Her and my mother were
good friends. right?

577
00:40:32.125 --> 00:40:35.667
That's what Mia wanted
people to think. yes.

578
00:40:35.792 --> 00:40:38.667
I saw the jealous look
on Mia's face

579
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:40.625
when Julie's back was turned.

580
00:40:40.708 --> 00:40:43.000
You notice a lot
if you just watch.

581
00:40:44.958 --> 00:40:46.583
Mia said she was excited

582
00:40:46.708 --> 00:40:48.667
when that house came back
on the market.

583
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.083
Do you know why she was
so eager to get it?

584
00:40:51.208 --> 00:40:53.750
[Florence] The house belonged
to your grandparents.

585
00:40:53.875 --> 00:40:56.125
When they died.
they left it to Sonya.

586
00:40:56.208 --> 00:41:00.583
Mia was finally able to scrape
her pennies together

587
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:02.500
and bring it back
into the family.

588
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.667
Bring it back into...

589
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.375
Are you. are you saying
Mia and Sonya were related?

590
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.167
Your birth mother
and Mia were cousins.

591
00:41:10.208 --> 00:41:12.958
Didn't you know that?

592
00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:14.583
So Mia is my...

593
00:41:16.042 --> 00:41:17.917
First cousin once removed.

594
00:41:20.708 --> 00:41:24.000
-Did Julie know that?
-She must've. yes.

595
00:41:24.083 --> 00:41:27.667
You knew my mother then.
Sonya. I mean.

596
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:31.000
I did.
She was a wonderful woman.

597
00:41:31.125 --> 00:41:33.250
[instrumental music]

598
00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.667
Do you know how she died?

599
00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:37.250
I heard there was
some kind of an accident.

600
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:43.000
It was very tragic. She fell
and drowned in the bathtub.

601
00:41:46.375 --> 00:41:49.000
[intense music]

602
00:41:49.083 --> 00:41:52.667
Oh. I've upset you.
I'm sorry for being so direct.

603
00:41:52.708 --> 00:41:55.500
No. no. please
don't worry about it.

604
00:41:55.583 --> 00:41:57.292
Thank you so much for your time.

605
00:41:57.375 --> 00:42:02.583
Oh. Julie came here too asking
about her just before she died.

606
00:42:02.667 --> 00:42:05.875
-About Mia?
-No. about Sonya.

607
00:42:07.333 --> 00:42:09.000
Thank you.

608
00:42:14.875 --> 00:42:16.500
[doorbell dings]

609
00:42:19.208 --> 00:42:21.500
This place looks amazing.

610
00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:23.333
My mom would have loved it.

611
00:42:23.417 --> 00:42:24.917
That's what I hoped!

612
00:42:27.667 --> 00:42:30.542
I wish I could stay.

613
00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:32.417
but it's my night to take care
of my gran. so...

614
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.042
Of course. I understand.
Thanks again.

615
00:42:45.875 --> 00:42:47.042
Kayla...

616
00:42:51.583 --> 00:42:54.167
She's a moody teenager.

617
00:42:54.292 --> 00:42:55.500
She'll come around.

618
00:42:55.583 --> 00:42:56.917
I hope so.

619
00:42:59.083 --> 00:43:00.375
Thanks for coming.

620
00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:02.542
I'm here to help.

621
00:43:02.625 --> 00:43:06.958
I. uh. already set up
the bar over there.

622
00:43:07.042 --> 00:43:11.792
And I stashed something here
just for you. if you need it.

623
00:43:13.875 --> 00:43:16.167
Ah. look.

624
00:43:16.208 --> 00:43:17.833
I got the coffee stains out.

625
00:43:19.875 --> 00:43:22.500
-What?
-I found out how Sonya died.

626
00:43:22.625 --> 00:43:25.667
I thought she had an accident.

627
00:43:25.792 --> 00:43:30.167
She did. She... fell
and drowned in the bathtub.

628
00:43:30.292 --> 00:43:34.625
-Just like my mom.
-That's a crazy coincidence.

629
00:43:34.625 --> 00:43:36.250
Don't you think
it's a little suspicious?

630
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:40.250
It just doesn't
sit right with me.

631
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.583
There's something there.

632
00:43:42.667 --> 00:43:45.875
All I see is
two horrible tragedies.

633
00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:48.333
I've gotta ask my dad
what Mia's deal is.

634
00:43:48.458 --> 00:43:51.917
Maybe right now
isn't the right time?

635
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.958
Mia and Sonya were cousins.

636
00:43:54.042 --> 00:43:55.333
Mia was always desperate
to own that house.

637
00:43:57.417 --> 00:43:58.833
She was friends
with Julie. and now

638
00:43:58.917 --> 00:44:01.000
she's trying to take over
the shop.

639
00:44:01.083 --> 00:44:02.542
I need to figure out
what Mia is cooking up--

640
00:44:02.542 --> 00:44:05.000
Canapes. I already told you.

641
00:44:05.125 --> 00:44:06.875
Oh. Hi.

642
00:44:06.958 --> 00:44:09.000
Um. have you seen my dad yet?

643
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.792
He wasn't anywhere to be found
when I arrived.

644
00:44:11.875 --> 00:44:13.875
Here. set up back there.

645
00:44:14.875 --> 00:44:16.375
I'll go find Paul.

646
00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:29.375
[Oliver] There you are.

647
00:44:30.708 --> 00:44:32.375
I'm glad you're here.

648
00:44:32.458 --> 00:44:34.792
There's nowhere I'd rather be.

649
00:44:34.792 --> 00:44:38.917
The loyalty that you've shown
the business. and to me...

650
00:44:39.042 --> 00:44:41.167
I'm so grateful that
you're part of the team.

651
00:44:43.083 --> 00:44:45.875
So. you and Wren.

652
00:44:45.875 --> 00:44:47.542
You seem to be on your way
to reconciling.

653
00:44:47.542 --> 00:44:49.667
It certainly feels that way.

654
00:44:49.792 --> 00:44:52.167
[Paul] So this opens
the question again

655
00:44:52.292 --> 00:44:56.167
of who'll take over the firm
when I retire.

656
00:44:56.292 --> 00:45:00.750
If you do end up
getting married after all...

657
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:02.833
the firm is yours.

658
00:45:02.917 --> 00:45:05.917
I'll do everything
I can to make that happen.

659
00:45:06.042 --> 00:45:09.375
I wanna keep the business
in the family.

660
00:45:09.458 --> 00:45:10.750
You're the only one I can trust.

661
00:45:12.208 --> 00:45:14.042
To becoming one of us.

662
00:45:15.792 --> 00:45:18.500
I. uh. I should let you know.

663
00:45:18.583 --> 00:45:19.750
Wren is starting
to ask questions.

664
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.833
Does she know anything?

665
00:45:21.917 --> 00:45:25.083
Not yet. but she's determined
to ask you about Mia.

666
00:45:26.875 --> 00:45:29.667
I-I convinced her that
tonight is not a good time.

667
00:45:33.583 --> 00:45:35.167
If she keeps pushing...

668
00:45:38.042 --> 00:45:40.708
give her one of these.
She'll be easier to deal with.

669
00:45:48.208 --> 00:45:49.875
The bruschetta shouldn't be
hiding back here.

670
00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:51.958
Go put it by the door.

671
00:46:00.458 --> 00:46:01.708
Are you going to explain

672
00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:03.917
what you were doing
upstairs in my house?

673
00:46:04.042 --> 00:46:06.708
Oh. I was just looking
for the bathroom.

674
00:46:06.708 --> 00:46:08.458
I don't like people sticking
their noses

675
00:46:08.542 --> 00:46:10.083
where they don't belong.

676
00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:11.542
If you have nothing to hide.

677
00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:13.333
it shouldn't be a problem.
right?

678
00:46:13.375 --> 00:46:14.917
What are you implying?

679
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.417
Nothing at all... yet.

680
00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:20.458
Back off.

681
00:46:20.542 --> 00:46:21.417
Or else what?

682
00:46:23.042 --> 00:46:25.500
Or else you'll regret it.

683
00:46:37.042 --> 00:46:38.708
[Wren] Have been thinking
about it

684
00:46:38.833 --> 00:46:43.000
and Kayla's right.
we can't keep fighting.

685
00:46:43.125 --> 00:46:44.417
Not today.

686
00:46:44.542 --> 00:46:46.750
I was going through those papers
you gave me.

687
00:46:46.875 --> 00:46:50.167
And? What'd you find?

688
00:46:50.208 --> 00:46:52.875
Looks like Mia was siphoning
money into her personal account.

689
00:46:52.958 --> 00:46:56.333
[gasps]
How much?

690
00:46:56.417 --> 00:46:58.958
Enough to sink the business
in a couple more months.

691
00:46:59.042 --> 00:47:01.833
She was bleeding them dry.

692
00:47:01.875 --> 00:47:04.750
Julie would have figured it out
eventually.

693
00:47:04.833 --> 00:47:06.167
If she hadn't already.

694
00:47:07.875 --> 00:47:08.917
She raised you
since you were nine

695
00:47:09.042 --> 00:47:11.000
but you never once called her...

696
00:47:20.833 --> 00:47:23.083
[intense music]

697
00:47:26.917 --> 00:47:29.250
Hey. Kayla. Wait!

698
00:47:29.333 --> 00:47:30.333
I'm sorry.

699
00:47:30.458 --> 00:47:32.417
Okay. Brody and I
were out of line.

700
00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:36.792
Okay. I was out of line.

701
00:47:36.875 --> 00:47:38.167
I just. I want to apologize

702
00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:42.583
for not focusing
on what's important today.

703
00:47:42.708 --> 00:47:46.542
Today's all about mom. and
I haven't been acting like it.

704
00:47:48.917 --> 00:47:51.542
Fine. I forgive you.

705
00:47:56.083 --> 00:47:57.667
Do you know how much time

706
00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:59.167
dad and Mia have
been spending together?

707
00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.375
-You're still doing it!
-Kayla--

708
00:48:01.375 --> 00:48:03.083
Mom and dad may have been
fighting a lot.

709
00:48:03.208 --> 00:48:05.083
-But they loved each other.
-I know that--

710
00:48:05.083 --> 00:48:07.000
People who love each other.
don't abandon each other.

711
00:48:07.125 --> 00:48:08.917
They don't leave people
at the altar

712
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.458
or run away across the country.

713
00:48:11.542 --> 00:48:13.667
Look. I'm sorry I left--

714
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:15.833
And whatever you think
about dad.

715
00:48:15.917 --> 00:48:18.042
he was there for us.
You weren't.

716
00:48:18.042 --> 00:48:19.542
I'm going home.

717
00:48:19.667 --> 00:48:20.667
I'll come with you.

718
00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:22.333
I don't need a babysitter.

719
00:48:27.833 --> 00:48:30.000
[glass clinking]

720
00:48:30.083 --> 00:48:34.625
Thank you to everyone
for being here tonight.

721
00:48:34.708 --> 00:48:37.500
Julie was an incredible person

722
00:48:37.542 --> 00:48:41.250
and she touched the lives
of everyone in this room.

723
00:48:41.333 --> 00:48:43.833
I thought it would be
a lovely idea

724
00:48:43.833 --> 00:48:47.000
for us to share our favorite
memory of Julie.

725
00:48:49.083 --> 00:48:52.167
Julie had a naturally
inquisitive spirit.

726
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:55.167
a quality that
she passed on in spades

727
00:48:55.167 --> 00:48:58.792
to her adopted daughter Wren.

728
00:48:58.875 --> 00:49:01.375
One day. Julie was wondering

729
00:49:01.375 --> 00:49:04.125
where the moonlight
philodendrons

730
00:49:04.208 --> 00:49:07.042
that we had been ordering
actually come from.

731
00:49:10.208 --> 00:49:12.833
I think something is going on
with my dad and Mia.

732
00:49:12.833 --> 00:49:16.667
What? [scoffs]
That's ridiculous.

733
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.333
I've gotta ask him about this.

734
00:49:18.417 --> 00:49:21.667
Right now doesn't seem
appropriate.

735
00:49:23.875 --> 00:49:28.208
Hey! You need to relax.

736
00:49:28.292 --> 00:49:31.042
Come with me.
I've got just the thing.

737
00:49:34.875 --> 00:49:37.417
I saw the two of them
holding hands earlier!

738
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:41.083
She's supporting her
dead best friend's husband.

739
00:49:41.083 --> 00:49:43.042
It's more than that.

740
00:49:49.917 --> 00:49:52.458
[suspenseful music]

741
00:49:57.833 --> 00:49:59.375
Listen. um...

742
00:50:01.417 --> 00:50:05.375
I can't tell you
not to ask him...

743
00:50:07.667 --> 00:50:09.250
but it's your mom's wake.

744
00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:14.667
Have a drink.

745
00:50:14.792 --> 00:50:18.458
Try and relax... and you can
ask him about it tomorrow.

746
00:50:21.208 --> 00:50:22.625
Fine.

747
00:50:32.792 --> 00:50:36.625
Hm... it's actually really nice.

748
00:50:36.708 --> 00:50:38.875
Thanks.

749
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.542
Yeah. I thought you could. uh.
use some wine.

750
00:50:46.542 --> 00:50:48.375
[Paul] Thank you so much.
everyone

751
00:50:48.458 --> 00:50:51.333
for sharing these
magnificent stories

752
00:50:51.333 --> 00:50:53.708
of our beloved Julie.

753
00:50:53.875 --> 00:50:56.500
She was the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

754
00:50:56.625 --> 00:50:59.208
-Okay. that's it.
-Oh. don't do this. Hey. hey.

755
00:50:59.208 --> 00:51:00.625
Come on. let's get you
freshened up.

756
00:51:00.708 --> 00:51:01.708
She's the best thing that's ever

757
00:51:01.708 --> 00:51:03.667
happened to you. huh?

758
00:51:03.792 --> 00:51:05.708
[laughing]

759
00:51:05.833 --> 00:51:07.250
You have a funny way
of showing it.

760
00:51:07.375 --> 00:51:08.542
Wren!

761
00:51:08.625 --> 00:51:10.875
Are you going to share
a memory of mom?

762
00:51:10.958 --> 00:51:14.042
Or have those
been cremated. too?

763
00:51:14.167 --> 00:51:16.958
It seems that
in my daughter's grief

764
00:51:17.042 --> 00:51:18.083
that she drank too much.

765
00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:20.292
Adopted daughter!

766
00:51:20.375 --> 00:51:23.500
Okay. let's go.
Let's go.

767
00:51:23.542 --> 00:51:25.958
I'm sure you can all appreciate
how difficult this is for us.

768
00:51:26.042 --> 00:51:30.000
What's going on
with you and Mia. dad?

769
00:51:30.125 --> 00:51:32.333
Don't be shy. Tell everyone.

770
00:51:32.375 --> 00:51:34.167
-That's enough!
-At your mother's wake...

771
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.125
-How dare you imply--
-I wanna stay and reminisce!

772
00:51:36.208 --> 00:51:38.000
[Oliver] We need to go.
[Wren] Stop it. I wanna stay.

773
00:51:38.083 --> 00:51:40.708
She just needs to
sleep this off.

774
00:51:40.708 --> 00:51:42.250
Thank you. son.

775
00:51:48.625 --> 00:51:50.208
There you go.

776
00:51:55.042 --> 00:51:56.583
[Oliver] Let's get you to home.
okay?

777
00:51:56.667 --> 00:52:00.625
No. I. I don't wanna
go back there.

778
00:52:02.708 --> 00:52:03.750
[sighs]

779
00:52:04.792 --> 00:52:07.083
All right. come on.

780
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.167
Okay. come on.

781
00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:19.375
Hey. hey. come on.

782
00:52:22.292 --> 00:52:24.750
You're okay. you're okay.
Ah. there you go.

783
00:52:28.833 --> 00:52:32.208
-Okay. hey.
-I feel so dizzy.

784
00:52:32.292 --> 00:52:34.292
You've just have the spins.

785
00:52:34.375 --> 00:52:36.500
There you go.
there you go.

786
00:52:38.833 --> 00:52:40.667
Okay. okay.

787
00:52:44.833 --> 00:52:47.625
[suspenseful music]

788
00:52:49.917 --> 00:52:51.542
Wren.

789
00:52:57.042 --> 00:52:58.792
Wren?

790
00:53:01.708 --> 00:53:03.250
Wren?

791
00:53:14.333 --> 00:53:16.500
You will be mine again.

792
00:53:19.833 --> 00:53:22.292
[intense music]

793
00:53:43.125 --> 00:53:44.708
[groans]

794
00:53:46.208 --> 00:53:48.708
[clattering]

795
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:03.792
[groans]

796
00:54:20.333 --> 00:54:22.333
[Oliver] Morning. sleepy head.

797
00:54:23.375 --> 00:54:25.083
Your favorite hangover cure.

798
00:54:25.167 --> 00:54:26.667
Aw!

799
00:54:26.708 --> 00:54:28.583
And do I need it.

800
00:54:30.417 --> 00:54:32.333
What happened last night?

801
00:54:32.417 --> 00:54:35.958
Ah! You were pretty drunk...

802
00:54:36.042 --> 00:54:38.250
Oh. no. What did I...

803
00:54:39.333 --> 00:54:41.375
-Not good. huh?
-Mm-hmm.

804
00:54:41.542 --> 00:54:42.500
Oh...

805
00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:44.958
Maybe best if I don't know.

806
00:54:45.083 --> 00:54:46.625
[sighs]

807
00:54:48.917 --> 00:54:51.333
Thanks for taking care of me.

808
00:54:51.333 --> 00:54:52.875
Of course.

809
00:54:52.958 --> 00:54:54.167
I hope you got me out of there

810
00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:55.417
before I really
embarrassed myself.

811
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.542
Ah. it was a close call.

812
00:54:58.667 --> 00:54:59.792
Oh.

813
00:54:59.875 --> 00:55:01.792
[laughing]

814
00:55:10.958 --> 00:55:15.042
I'm really sorry. Oliver.
For everything.

815
00:55:16.958 --> 00:55:18.542
I really did love you. you know.

816
00:55:21.958 --> 00:55:23.542
I still love you.

817
00:55:26.167 --> 00:55:27.667
I always have.

818
00:55:30.375 --> 00:55:32.000
I always will.

819
00:55:32.208 --> 00:55:34.625
[instrumental music]

820
00:55:56.583 --> 00:55:58.375
That was just how I remember it.

821
00:55:59.708 --> 00:56:02.083
I hope that's not a bad thing.

822
00:56:02.208 --> 00:56:03.792
Not at all.

823
00:56:19.458 --> 00:56:22.125
Eat up.
I'm gonna go shower.

824
00:56:22.208 --> 00:56:23.458
Okay.

825
00:56:25.083 --> 00:56:26.500
You want a coffee?

826
00:56:26.542 --> 00:56:28.417
[Oliver] Pods are beside
the fridge.

827
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.000
I remember.

828
00:56:33.333 --> 00:56:34.750
Mm.

829
00:56:44.333 --> 00:56:45.750
[sighs]

830
00:56:52.125 --> 00:56:54.708
[suspenseful music]

831
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.500
[Oliver] Hey. beautiful.

832
00:57:05.042 --> 00:57:08.333
You went for dinner with a woman
named Francesca?

833
00:57:08.417 --> 00:57:09.833
Ah!
[chuckles]

834
00:57:09.958 --> 00:57:13.625
It was a. it was a first date
and a last date.

835
00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:17.833
You don't have
to be bitter.

836
00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:22.292
Although I do find your
jealous streak adorable.

837
00:57:22.375 --> 00:57:25.542
And you were out with her
on Friday?

838
00:57:27.125 --> 00:57:31.542
Well. that. we were supposed
to go out on Friday.

839
00:57:31.625 --> 00:57:34.667
but I think we went out
on Thursday.

840
00:57:34.667 --> 00:57:36.500
You're hiding something.

841
00:57:36.542 --> 00:57:38.750
[chuckles]
What are you talking about?

842
00:57:42.708 --> 00:57:45.792
You weren't out with my dad
the night my mom was murdered.

843
00:57:47.417 --> 00:57:48.708
Where was my dad. Oliver?

844
00:57:50.542 --> 00:57:52.167
Well. if you don't tell me.
I'm gonna ask him myself.

845
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.667
Okay.

846
00:57:53.875 --> 00:57:55.083
Fine.

847
00:57:56.208 --> 00:57:57.708
[sighs]

848
00:57:57.833 --> 00:58:00.792
-He was with Mia.
-Mia?

849
00:58:00.875 --> 00:58:03.542
Last night you swore up and down
that Mia is just a good friend.

850
00:58:03.625 --> 00:58:05.042
I was trying to protect him.

851
00:58:05.125 --> 00:58:08.583
Protect him? What about me?

852
00:58:16.083 --> 00:58:17.833
Where are you going?

853
00:58:17.958 --> 00:58:19.583
I'm going to see if the police
are interested

854
00:58:19.708 --> 00:58:21.708
in my dad's whereabouts
the night of my mom's death.

855
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:30.125
I can't let you do that.

856
00:58:30.208 --> 00:58:35.875
-Get out of the way. Oliver.
-You're not going to the police.

857
00:58:38.125 --> 00:58:39.542
I was right to run out on you.

858
00:58:39.542 --> 00:58:43.208
I've worked too long
and hard for this.

859
00:58:44.875 --> 00:58:46.208
You're right.

860
00:58:46.292 --> 00:58:48.083
You're right. I'm sorry.

861
00:58:48.167 --> 00:58:50.583
It's okay. I was wrong.

862
00:58:50.667 --> 00:58:53.000
I won't go.

863
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.500
I love you.

864
00:58:55.375 --> 00:58:57.042
[Oliver groans]

865
00:58:59.875 --> 00:59:02.833
[intense music]

866
00:59:13.625 --> 00:59:15.917
I want to see what's going
on here. See you inside.

867
00:59:18.208 --> 00:59:19.833
Morning. Oliver.

868
00:59:19.917 --> 00:59:21.500
You missed family dinner
last weekend.

869
00:59:21.542 --> 00:59:22.833
Hanging out with the ex?

870
00:59:22.875 --> 00:59:24.917
Yes.
I'm sorry about that. cuz.

871
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.250
Ah. no worries.
I get it. I get it.

872
00:59:27.375 --> 00:59:28.625
No judgment here.

873
00:59:28.625 --> 00:59:31.208
We just sort of
had a disagreement.

874
00:59:32.583 --> 00:59:34.167
What did you do to her?

875
00:59:34.167 --> 00:59:35.833
I...

876
00:59:35.875 --> 00:59:37.958
You can tell me.
What did you do?

877
00:59:38.083 --> 00:59:40.125
-We...
-Ah!

878
00:59:40.125 --> 00:59:41.708
I'm just kidding.

879
00:59:41.792 --> 00:59:44.000
I'll let you know what she says.

880
00:59:44.083 --> 00:59:45.750
Okay. take care.

881
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:53.042
Oh. I had a chat
with your boyfriend

882
00:59:53.167 --> 00:59:56.000
in the parking lot
before I came in. Yeah.

883
00:59:56.083 --> 00:59:58.417
I'm sure Oliver will have
some flowers waiting for you

884
00:59:58.417 --> 00:59:59.917
when you get home.

885
01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:02.333
[scoffs]

886
01:00:03.875 --> 01:00:05.708
I'm not here about Oliver.

887
01:00:06.625 --> 01:00:09.708
It's my father.

888
01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:11.833
He wasn't out for dinner at all
the night my mother died.

889
01:00:11.917 --> 01:00:15.083
he was... with his mistress.

890
01:00:16.542 --> 01:00:18.833
Okay.
I've known Paul a long time.

891
01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:21.500
He's a respected member
of this community.

892
01:00:21.583 --> 01:00:24.000
Respected members
of the community can lie.

893
01:00:24.167 --> 01:00:25.333
Even to the police.

894
01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:27.458
Wren. we've been over this.

895
01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:29.667
Your mother's death
was an accident.

896
01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:31.458
-But I have new evidence.
-Evidence of what?

897
01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:33.042
That y-your father
was having an affair?

898
01:00:33.167 --> 01:00:34.333
Yes!

899
01:00:34.417 --> 01:00:35.958
So if he was out
with his mistress

900
01:00:36.042 --> 01:00:37.542
the night of your
mother's death.

901
01:00:37.542 --> 01:00:39.000
he still has a solid alibi.

902
01:00:39.083 --> 01:00:41.333
Something just doesn't
feel right about it.

903
01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:43.167
If they were having an affair.

904
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.917
one of them would have wanted
my mother out of the picture.

905
01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:48.833
You know. we don't reopen cases
on feelings. Ms. Williams.

906
01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:51.042
But if you could just
question him. I think--

907
01:00:51.167 --> 01:00:53.083
The case is closed.

908
01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.000
What about the fact
that my biological mother.

909
01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:57.542
Sonya Kenny. died exactly
the same way right next door?

910
01:00:57.667 --> 01:00:59.625
And I told you that most people

911
01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:01.500
die in their homes.
Ms. Williams.

912
01:01:01.583 --> 01:01:03.667
What are the odds
that two people die--

913
01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:06.500
I'm a very busy man.
It's time for you to go.

914
01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:08.125
Detective. there is more
to this story.

915
01:01:08.292 --> 01:01:09.875
There is nothing else.

916
01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.875
Please. Ms. Williams.

917
01:01:13.333 --> 01:01:15.500
[sighs]

918
01:01:15.583 --> 01:01:18.292
-If you'd just listen--
-Nothing. let's go.

919
01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:27.375
Hey. hey. maybe it's time
you went back to the city.

920
01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:29.167
My family needs me here.

921
01:01:29.208 --> 01:01:32.667
It doesn't seem like you
being here is helping anyone.

922
01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:34.208
What're you doing here?

923
01:01:34.292 --> 01:01:36.167
Oh. I'm sorry about
all this. Paul.

924
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.500
Ah. let's you and I grab that
game of golf next week. Okay?

925
01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:41.000
-My treat. Yeah.
-Will do. thanks.

926
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.583
-Wren. hey. wait.
-I don't wanna talk to you.

927
01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:47.583
Oliver called me and told me
you were going to the police.

928
01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:49.500
You two are thick as thieves.
aren't you?

929
01:01:49.583 --> 01:01:53.583
Slow down. will you? Just. just
come back to the house with me.

930
01:01:53.667 --> 01:01:55.625
Where's Kayla?

931
01:01:55.708 --> 01:01:56.667
Brody took her to Rachel's
for the night

932
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:59.042
so that you and I can talk.

933
01:01:59.167 --> 01:02:00.958
I'm not going anywhere with you.

934
01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:02.333
You stay away from me.

935
01:02:02.417 --> 01:02:06.708
No. wait. I'm not the bad guy
you think I am.

936
01:02:06.708 --> 01:02:08.208
You're hurting me.

937
01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:11.167
I'm-I'm sorry.

938
01:02:13.083 --> 01:02:14.208
I'm sorry.

939
01:02:29.583 --> 01:02:31.125
[clatters]

940
01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:41.125
[intense music]

941
01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:54.792
-Ahh!
-Uh! Wren!

942
01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:56.667
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know you were here.

943
01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:59.667
Oh. my God!
You scared me half to death!

944
01:02:59.792 --> 01:03:04.000
Sorry. I'm just on edge.

945
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.875
Yeah. I'll say.
Is everything all right?

946
01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:11.333
It's been a weird 24 hours.

947
01:03:11.333 --> 01:03:15.208
I made a real fool of myself
last night.

948
01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.625
What happened?

949
01:03:16.708 --> 01:03:19.167
Oh. I got way too drunk
and ran my mouth.

950
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:22.333
Apparently.
I don't really remember much...

951
01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:24.292
Oh!

952
01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:26.000
Finding comfort
at the bottom of a bottle

953
01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:29.000
during a time like this
is pretty normal.

954
01:03:29.083 --> 01:03:31.625
You know what. I think
I only had one glass.

955
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:33.375
Are you eating enough lately?

956
01:03:35.167 --> 01:03:37.042
Ah. I guess not.

957
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
I totally outed my dad's affair
with Mia in front of everyone.

958
01:03:43.083 --> 01:03:46.833
I'm almost glad my mom wasn't
around to find out like that.

959
01:03:46.917 --> 01:03:49.792
[sighs]
Uh... that reminds me.

960
01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.792
I think you should see this.

961
01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.042
I found this the other day.

962
01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:06.333
So my mom knew too.

963
01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:09.250
I guess that's what she meant

964
01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:11.458
when she said Mia
stole something from her.

965
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:21.542
I was just gonna go to get
something to eat.

966
01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:22.833
Care to join me?

967
01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.375
Mm. Thanks.

968
01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:28.500
I think I'm just gonna stay here
a little while longer.

969
01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:42.458
[sighs]

970
01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:59.083
[mellow music]

971
01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:11.250
[sniffles]

972
01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:29.667
[music continues]

973
01:05:58.125 --> 01:06:00.583
[suspenseful music]

974
01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:24.333
[car engine starts]

975
01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:29.083
[dramatic music]

976
01:06:32.708 --> 01:06:35.667
[Oliver] Hey! Come here!

977
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:36.958
Stop!

978
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.958
[gate opens]

979
01:07:02.167 --> 01:07:03.625
[Oliver] Wren!

980
01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:07.000
Just wanna talk.

981
01:07:10.542 --> 01:07:11.958
Come on.

982
01:07:12.042 --> 01:07:13.708
It's just your Oliver.

983
01:07:16.125 --> 01:07:17.708
[twig snaps]

984
01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:23.250
[Oliver] It's okay. Wren.

985
01:07:24.417 --> 01:07:25.792
It's okay.

986
01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.458
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

987
01:07:34.708 --> 01:07:37.250
[dramatic music]

988
01:07:43.583 --> 01:07:45.375
Get away from me. Oliver!

989
01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.917
Can we just go back to
where we were this morning?

990
01:07:47.917 --> 01:07:50.875
Before or after you drugged me?

991
01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:52.875
Why did you do it?

992
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.667
I did it to protect you.

993
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.375
From what?

994
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.125
-The truth.
-You did it to control me.

995
01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:03.333
You always have to
have your way.

996
01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:05.458
It's always about
what's best for you.

997
01:08:05.542 --> 01:08:08.042
You're crazy
if you believe that.

998
01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:11.625
You know. that day
I ran out on our wedding...

999
01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:14.167
I couldn't have even told you
why I was running.

1000
01:08:14.292 --> 01:08:16.375
I sat at some highway truck stop

1001
01:08:16.375 --> 01:08:19.500
in the middle of
nowhere for hours.

1002
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.958
punishing myself with how
I might have just walked away

1003
01:08:22.042 --> 01:08:23.542
from a fairy tale life.

1004
01:08:25.083 --> 01:08:27.625
I can finally see it.

1005
01:08:27.625 --> 01:08:30.333
You are manipulative
and controlling.

1006
01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:32.917
and even though I didn't
notice it outright back then.

1007
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.667
I could still feel you
suffocating me.

1008
01:08:34.667 --> 01:08:36.500
I would never
tried to control you.

1009
01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:39.500
No? You didn't manipulate me
and my family

1010
01:08:39.583 --> 01:08:42.167
into giving you everything
you needed from us?

1011
01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:44.792
My mother's affection.
my hand in marriage?

1012
01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:46.417
My father's business?

1013
01:08:46.542 --> 01:08:47.917
We could've been
so happy together.

1014
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
You don't know what that is!

1015
01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:52.750
You don't build
a life of happiness

1016
01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.542
on deceit and duplicity.

1017
01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:56.417
An architect should understand
the importance

1018
01:08:56.417 --> 01:08:58.208
of a strong foundation.

1019
01:09:00.083 --> 01:09:01.750
Help! Help.

1020
01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:03.792
You're right. hey.
you're right.

1021
01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:06.167
I-I promise I'll be better.

1022
01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:08.125
I'll rebuild
that foundation. okay?

1023
01:09:08.208 --> 01:09:10.125
There's nothing I wanna
rebuild with you.

1024
01:09:10.208 --> 01:09:13.000
I love you. Wren.
please don't do this.

1025
01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:15.833
You stay away from me
and my family!

1026
01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:17.500
Why can't you listen to me?

1027
01:09:17.625 --> 01:09:19.500
-Ah!
-Oh!

1028
01:09:22.042 --> 01:09:23.500
Wren!

1029
01:09:25.542 --> 01:09:27.667
I'm not going anywhere. Wren!

1030
01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:31.250
I got your pathetic father
wrapped around my finger.

1031
01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:38.125
I am more a part of this family
than you'll ever be!

1032
01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.000
[groans]

1033
01:09:41.083 --> 01:09:42.542
Wren!

1034
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.667
Wren!

1035
01:09:49.167 --> 01:09:50.500
[knock on door]

1036
01:09:52.208 --> 01:09:54.500
How could you steal my dad
away like that?

1037
01:09:54.583 --> 01:09:56.875
Steal him away?

1038
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.500
He pursued me. Relentlessly.

1039
01:10:00.583 --> 01:10:02.833
I'm surprised
you're so shocked by that.

1040
01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:05.542
-Given your father's history.
-What are you talking about?

1041
01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:08.667
He was having an affair
with Sonya before she died.

1042
01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:10.708
For years.

1043
01:10:10.792 --> 01:10:12.208
That's not possible.

1044
01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.417
I told Julie about
his affair with Sonya

1045
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.208
so she'd finally leave Paul.

1046
01:10:17.292 --> 01:10:19.500
And you could swoop in.

1047
01:10:19.542 --> 01:10:22.542
He came over that night.
to ask me to marry him

1048
01:10:22.542 --> 01:10:25.417
after he'd finally broken
the news to Julie.

1049
01:10:25.542 --> 01:10:28.208
So you weren't together
the entire night.

1050
01:10:28.292 --> 01:10:32.000
And you were outside creeping
around when I got here.

1051
01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:34.167
I went out to buy a champagne.

1052
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:36.042
Of course. we couldn't enjoy it.

1053
01:10:36.167 --> 01:10:38.208
There are holes in your alibi.

1054
01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:42.458
Everyone is calling
this an accident.

1055
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:45.792
You know what I think?

1056
01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:49.000
I think Julie killed herself
out of grief

1057
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.833
over having
a daughter like you.

1058
01:10:50.958 --> 01:10:53.167
Well. it seems to me that every
woman who gets in your way

1059
01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:54.875
ends up dead in a bathtub.

1060
01:10:58.583 --> 01:10:59.875
Homewrecker!

1061
01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:07.625
It takes two to have
an affair. sweetheart.

1062
01:11:20.917 --> 01:11:22.000
[Paul] Ah!

1063
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.042
[Paul sniffles]

1064
01:11:23.042 --> 01:11:24.625
[Paul sobbing]

1065
01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:52.917
Headache?

1066
01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:56.250
Oh. Wren.

1067
01:11:57.875 --> 01:11:59.250
It's you!

1068
01:11:59.333 --> 01:12:00.792
Get off me!

1069
01:12:02.542 --> 01:12:04.625
How could you betray mom
like that?

1070
01:12:04.708 --> 01:12:06.625
I. I can't help.

1071
01:12:06.708 --> 01:12:10.875
I think that her. her
accident was my punishment.

1072
01:12:12.417 --> 01:12:13.667
If it was your punishment.

1073
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.708
she wouldn't be the one
who is dead.

1074
01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:20.625
I'm-I'm sorry I wasn't there
to save her.

1075
01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:24.417
Please.

1076
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:29.292
But don't-don't tell Kayla
about Mia.

1077
01:12:30.667 --> 01:12:32.667
She's been through enough.

1078
01:12:32.833 --> 01:12:35.833
It has nothing to do with
protecting yourself. does it?

1079
01:12:35.917 --> 01:12:39.542
Promise me that you.
you won't say anything.

1080
01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:44.000
-Let me go.
-I can't.

1081
01:12:44.083 --> 01:12:48.042
I can't let you go.
Not until you understand.

1082
01:12:56.375 --> 01:12:57.583
Fine.

1083
01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.083
Let's have a drink.

1084
01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:02.792
Yeah.

1085
01:13:04.792 --> 01:13:08.000
I-I'll clear everything up.
I-I promise.

1086
01:13:10.583 --> 01:13:14.083
I-I know exactly
how to fix this. I know.

1087
01:13:14.083 --> 01:13:15.458
I should fix this.

1088
01:13:16.375 --> 01:13:18.125
[indistinct]

1089
01:13:29.667 --> 01:13:31.375
-[glasses clink]
-Bottoms up.

1090
01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:51.917
Hey.

1091
01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:56.500
You recognize this?

1092
01:13:56.583 --> 01:13:58.375
[Paul] Oh! Sonya...

1093
01:14:02.208 --> 01:14:03.667
Sonya?

1094
01:14:05.958 --> 01:14:07.083
My Sonya.

1095
01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:13.167
You. you look like you did
the day we first met.

1096
01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:19.417
If you'd just understood that...

1097
01:14:20.583 --> 01:14:23.292
I-I couldn't just leave Julie.

1098
01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:27.000
Not after her father
gave me the firm.

1099
01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:28.750
What did you do. Paul?

1100
01:14:33.167 --> 01:14:34.958
You. you were so angry.

1101
01:14:35.042 --> 01:14:37.417
You slipped when you came
after me.

1102
01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:43.083
Hit your head on the tap.
There was blood everywhere.

1103
01:14:46.333 --> 01:14:47.792
And then what?

1104
01:14:49.167 --> 01:14:52.833
You slipped under the surface.

1105
01:14:54.875 --> 01:14:57.458
You looked so serene underwater.

1106
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:05.792
I-I was gonna pull you out.
I swear.

1107
01:15:08.667 --> 01:15:11.625
But then I started thinking
how...

1108
01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:14.125
how peaceful everything
would get.

1109
01:15:16.167 --> 01:15:19.208
How could you be
so spineless?

1110
01:15:22.708 --> 01:15:24.000
Wren!

1111
01:15:25.917 --> 01:15:26.958
Oh. Wren.

1112
01:15:27.042 --> 01:15:28.208
Wren! I-I'm sorry!

1113
01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:32.000
Wren. please!

1114
01:15:32.083 --> 01:15:34.458
Everything I did...

1115
01:15:34.542 --> 01:15:36.625
was to give you
an easier life...

1116
01:15:37.917 --> 01:15:39.542
with us.

1117
01:15:39.542 --> 01:15:41.708
You stole me from my mother!

1118
01:15:47.333 --> 01:15:48.833
[door opens]

1119
01:15:52.208 --> 01:15:53.625
Brody!

1120
01:15:57.958 --> 01:16:00.625
-I have to go to the police.
-What happened?

1121
01:16:00.625 --> 01:16:03.333
Dad just confessed
to watching Sonya die.

1122
01:16:03.417 --> 01:16:06.708
And I think he killed mom. too.

1123
01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.875
Oh. come on.
Where is he?

1124
01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:10.792
He's passed out in his office.

1125
01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:14.917
I don't want go. No.

1126
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.792
[intense music]

1127
01:16:25.167 --> 01:16:26.875
[indistinct chatter]

1128
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:31.208
[Paul] No. you can't.
[Brody] It had to be done.

1129
01:16:31.208 --> 01:16:32.833
[Paul] Brody!
[Brody] Shh!

1130
01:16:32.833 --> 01:16:34.542
[Paul] No. no. I think she got--

1131
01:16:34.625 --> 01:16:36.375
[Brody] Calm down. dad.
[Paul] No.

1132
01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:38.542
[Brody] You know
I can handle this.

1133
01:16:46.042 --> 01:16:47.833
You killed mom?

1134
01:16:48.833 --> 01:16:51.792
And you almost caught me!

1135
01:16:51.875 --> 01:16:54.083
Few minutes earlier
and you might have saved her.

1136
01:16:59.125 --> 01:17:00.708
Let me go. Brody!

1137
01:17:02.375 --> 01:17:03.792
Why'd you have to come back?

1138
01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:08.708
Things were so much easier
without you.

1139
01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:14.250
Now everyone's gonna think
that the art therapist

1140
01:17:14.375 --> 01:17:17.250
couldn't handle her own trauma.

1141
01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:19.083
Brody. don't do this.

1142
01:17:20.708 --> 01:17:25.833
Wren knows too much now.
Just like Julie did.

1143
01:17:25.917 --> 01:17:29.375
Mia told Julie about
dad's affair with Sonya.

1144
01:17:29.458 --> 01:17:33.167
And then Julie figured out that
dad was involved in her death.

1145
01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:34.958
So you killed her.

1146
01:17:35.042 --> 01:17:39.042
Julie was gonna go
to the police and turn dad in.

1147
01:17:39.042 --> 01:17:42.792
After all these years.
she just couldn't let it go.

1148
01:17:42.875 --> 01:17:46.417
I never wanted Julie to die.

1149
01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:48.667
She was gonna ruin everything!

1150
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:51.708
Your life would have been over.

1151
01:17:53.417 --> 01:17:54.875
Don't do this. Brody!

1152
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.125
You don't need two lives
on your conscience.

1153
01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:03.917
Three. if you count
that weasel Oliver.

1154
01:18:05.875 --> 01:18:08.292
One more won't make
a difference.

1155
01:18:08.375 --> 01:18:09.792
[shudders]

1156
01:18:11.792 --> 01:18:13.917
I know you can't see it
right now. dad.

1157
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.583
but she needs to die.

1158
01:18:16.583 --> 01:18:20.583
But. Brody. you can't kill her.

1159
01:18:20.583 --> 01:18:22.333
She's my biological daughter!

1160
01:18:24.125 --> 01:18:26.625
[Wren] What? Dad?

1161
01:18:26.708 --> 01:18:28.417
What're you talking about?

1162
01:18:28.542 --> 01:18:30.333
Sonya.

1163
01:18:30.333 --> 01:18:32.542
She wanted to keep you.

1164
01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:36.417
A-and since Julie
couldn't get pregnant.

1165
01:18:36.417 --> 01:18:41.250
I knew that you were my only
chance at a real child.

1166
01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:43.833
We don't use that word
in this family!

1167
01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:45.292
-[Wren] No!
-Oh!

1168
01:18:51.042 --> 01:18:52.250
But. Brody.

1169
01:18:52.333 --> 01:18:56.042
I did everything for him
and it was never enough.

1170
01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.958
I guess this explains
why you were his favorite.

1171
01:19:01.792 --> 01:19:03.792
Brody. [groans]

1172
01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:06.708
Oh...

1173
01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.500
[Brody] Wren!

1176
01:19:24.375 --> 01:19:25.375
No. Brody.

[panting]

1178
01:19:35.375 --> 01:19:37.667
Leave her alone. Brody!

1179
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:40.083
Stay out of this.
This is between me and Wren.

1180
01:19:41.792 --> 01:19:44.208
-Oh. God!

-Yeah.

Paul!

1189
01:20:32.542 --> 01:20:33.792
What's going on?

1190
01:20:35.542 --> 01:20:39.583
What did you do?
Talk to me.

1191
01:20:39.667 --> 01:20:41.042
What did you do?

1192
01:20:56.792 --> 01:20:58.917
I'm good now.
Thank you.

[instrumental music]

1194
01:21:04.583 --> 01:21:06.333
Just give me a sec.

1195
01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:16.333
Thank you for
calling the police.

1196
01:21:16.417 --> 01:21:20.292
I told you. You notice a lot
if you just watch.

1197
01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:22.250
I'm so glad you're okay.

1198
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.500
Thank you.

Oh. nice.

1204
01:22:08.250 --> 01:22:11.500
How's it feel to be Greenville's
first art therapist?

1205
01:22:13.208 --> 01:22:14.958
I couldn't have done this
without you. Gina.

1206
01:22:14.958 --> 01:22:16.333
Anything for you. Wren.

1207
01:22:16.333 --> 01:22:18.167
I hope you'll stay on with me?

1208
01:22:18.208 --> 01:22:21.375
As my full-time
organizer extraordinaire?

1209
01:22:22.667 --> 01:22:23.917
Mm. let's see.

1210
01:22:23.917 --> 01:22:26.083
Of course. of course. I will!

Ah. it looks perfect.

I think you're gonna be able to
help a lot of people.

1217

There's a lot of people
in this world who need help.

Mom would have loved this.

1219
01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:05.417
How about we have
a painting session

1220
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.792
before we officially open
for business?

1221
01:23:07.875 --> 01:23:09.875
