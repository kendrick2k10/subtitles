4
00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:10.184
We choose who we want to be.

5
00:00:11.402 --> 00:00:14.362
We choose
how we spend our time.

6
00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:16.842
And we choose
what is important to us.

7
00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:20.672
My name is Sam.

8
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:27.331
That'’s Sarah.
my beautiful wife.

9
00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:28.941
We have a baby on the way.

10
00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:31.944
I have a tech start-up.

11
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.252
It has potential
but not a lot of money.

12
00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:38.212
Sarah says I work too much.

13
00:00:38.908 --> 00:00:40.083
And she'’s right.

14
00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:44.087
It should be the happiest
time of my life...

15
00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:47.960
...but for some reason...

16
00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:51.051
...I am in turmoil.

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.454
Hey.
You'’re gonna be okay.

18
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:25.520
Sir. stay with me.
Keep your eyes open.

19
00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:28.697
Everything'’s gonna be okay!

20
00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:36.835
Everything'’s
gonna be okay!

21
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.012
I love you!

22
00:05:25.107 --> 00:05:26.804
Help!

23
00:05:27.675 --> 00:05:28.980
Anybody?

24
00:05:29.154 --> 00:05:30.330
Help!

25
00:06:34.742 --> 00:06:35.786
Die!

26
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:38.528
Come on!

27
00:06:40.748 --> 00:06:42.184
Die!

28
00:06:48.277 --> 00:06:49.452
Hey!

29
00:06:49.626 --> 00:06:51.411
Anybody!

30
00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:52.890
Help!

31
00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:55.545
Help!

32
00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:32.190
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

33
00:08:24.634 --> 00:08:26.331
What the fuck is going on?

34
00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:51.095
No fuckin'’ signal.

35
00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:41.493
Jesus.

36
00:09:41.668 --> 00:09:43.017
Can I help you?

37
00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:47.325
What'’s going on here?

38
00:09:47.499 --> 00:09:48.979
You rang the call button.

39
00:09:49.153 --> 00:09:50.372
I answered.

40
00:09:50.546 --> 00:09:52.156
What?

41
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.245
You shouldn'’t have
gotten out of bed.

42
00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:56.378
You need to stay and rest.

43
00:09:56.552 --> 00:09:57.597
I was attacked!

44
00:09:57.771 --> 00:09:58.685
By who?

45
00:09:58.859 --> 00:09:59.860
By hi--

46
00:10:00.034 --> 00:10:01.513
What the fuck?

47
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:03.994
He was just--

48
00:10:07.432 --> 00:10:08.608
No fucking way.

49
00:10:20.445 --> 00:10:21.490
Fuck!

50
00:10:46.167 --> 00:10:48.212
No fucking way.

51
00:10:58.179 --> 00:10:59.267
Come on!

52
00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:05.055
Come on!

53
00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:57.499
Fuck!

54
00:11:58.195 --> 00:11:59.370
Fuck.

55
00:12:01.764 --> 00:12:02.809
Help!

56
00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:05.072
Anybody!

57
00:12:06.247 --> 00:12:07.465
Hello?

58
00:12:57.559 --> 00:13:00.040
Hey. Hey. You'’re
going to be okay.

59
00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:01.650
I'’m gonna get
you out of here.

60
00:13:01.824 --> 00:13:02.869
This looks bad.

61
00:13:04.479 --> 00:13:05.959
The other guy
was drinking.

62
00:13:09.353 --> 00:13:10.528
Dead now.

63
00:13:10.702 --> 00:13:12.704
Hey. Don'’t listen to him.

64
00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:13.967
Just look at me.

65
00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:15.838
Look at me.

66
00:13:17.535 --> 00:13:19.320
Think you can reach up
and grab my hand?

67
00:13:39.383 --> 00:13:42.038
Anything to look
beautiful. Right?

68
00:13:43.605 --> 00:13:45.520
You already
look beautiful.

69
00:13:45.694 --> 00:13:48.044
Oh! You hear that. Doc?

70
00:13:48.218 --> 00:13:50.220
She'’s gonna put you
out of business.

71
00:13:50.394 --> 00:13:52.832
Oh. I'’m going to make you
even more beautiful.

72
00:13:53.006 --> 00:13:54.050
You better!

73
00:13:54.877 --> 00:13:57.053
Ass. nose. lips.

74
00:13:57.227 --> 00:13:58.968
Only have tits to go.

75
00:13:59.142 --> 00:14:02.885
You ready? Just relax
and look up at the light.

76
00:14:05.322 --> 00:14:07.629
She'’ll stop shining it
in your face any moment now.

77
00:14:07.803 --> 00:14:09.805
It is very annoying.

78
00:14:09.979 --> 00:14:12.721
Mmm. That'’s--
That'’s a bit bright.

79
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.167
Now I want you
to count down from nine.

80
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:25.734
Nine.

81
00:14:25.908 --> 00:14:28.476
eight. seven--

82
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.304
Good. Keep going down.

83
00:14:30.478 --> 00:14:32.610
Six.

84
00:14:32.784 --> 00:14:34.830
five...

85
00:14:35.004 --> 00:14:36.310
four.

86
00:14:36.484 --> 00:14:38.747
Three.

87
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:40.531
two.

88
00:14:40.705 --> 00:14:41.837
one.

89
00:16:02.265 --> 00:16:05.094
Help!
Somebody. help me!

90
00:16:05.268 --> 00:16:06.835
Help!

91
00:16:09.577 --> 00:16:11.535
Please! Please! No!

92
00:16:13.102 --> 00:16:15.931
No. no. no.
No. please. Help!

93
00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:19.282
Please! Please!

94
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.286
Hey!

95
00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:25.593
Hey!

96
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:30.598
Get away from her!

97
00:16:30.772 --> 00:16:33.122
Help me! Please!

98
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.866
Don'’t come near me.

99
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:40.260
I mean it!

100
00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:57.277
No!

101
00:16:57.451 --> 00:16:58.800
Hit her!

102
00:17:04.066 --> 00:17:06.547
What?

103
00:17:10.507 --> 00:17:11.508
Come on.

104
00:17:17.384 --> 00:17:19.429
Don'’t you fucking come near me.

105
00:17:22.824 --> 00:17:24.173
Run!

106
00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:29.091
That'’s right.

107
00:17:48.284 --> 00:17:49.459
What the fuck?

108
00:18:12.656 --> 00:18:14.397
Fuck.

109
00:18:15.268 --> 00:18:16.182
Are you all right?

110
00:18:16.356 --> 00:18:18.793
Um. I'’m. uh--

111
00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:20.882
I'’m not sure how
to even answer that.

112
00:18:21.056 --> 00:18:22.144
Me neither.

113
00:18:24.146 --> 00:18:26.453
I think you'’re the first
real person I'’ve seen.

114
00:18:27.367 --> 00:18:28.672
I'’m Sam.

115
00:18:29.543 --> 00:18:30.718
Monica.

116
00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:34.809
Who were those women?

117
00:18:34.983 --> 00:18:37.028
And-- And where
is everyone?

118
00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:39.553
I don'’t know.

119
00:18:39.727 --> 00:18:41.729
But we'’re gonna have
to figure this out.

120
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:45.733
What'’s the last thing
you remember?

121
00:18:46.429 --> 00:18:48.170
Um. I. um--

122
00:18:49.084 --> 00:18:51.608
I was going into surgery.

123
00:18:51.782 --> 00:18:54.959
and-- and then I woke up
on the operating table.

124
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:57.658
surrounded by them.

125
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.357
Same thing happened to me.

126
00:19:02.358 --> 00:19:03.359
but without the "them."

127
00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:06.406
So. we'’re alone?

128
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.234
You really haven'’t
seen anyone else?

129
00:19:09.322 --> 00:19:10.540
Not exactly.

130
00:19:10.714 --> 00:19:12.368
What'’s that
supposed to mean?

131
00:19:15.545 --> 00:19:20.071
A man in a coma woke up
and tried to kill me. Twice.

132
00:19:20.246 --> 00:19:21.247
W-- What?

133
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:22.596
Look.

134
00:19:23.553 --> 00:19:24.946
We need to keep moving.

135
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.122
- We need to get out of here.
- Okay.

136
00:19:27.296 --> 00:19:28.602
- Hey!
- What?

137
00:19:28.776 --> 00:19:30.169
Not that way.

138
00:19:30.343 --> 00:19:32.171
The sign says that'’s
the way to the elevator.

139
00:19:32.345 --> 00:19:35.609
Yeah? Well. the homicidal
coma man says otherwise.

140
00:19:36.523 --> 00:19:38.177
You need to trust me.

141
00:19:38.351 --> 00:19:39.917
We need to find
a different way.

142
00:19:41.528 --> 00:19:42.746
Let'’s go.

143
00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:45.662
Okay.

144
00:19:58.284 --> 00:20:00.460
Shit.
The phones are dead.

145
00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:03.027
It'’s a zombie apocalypse.
isn'’t it?

146
00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.248
It'’s not the zombie apocalypse.

147
00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:11.384
When I stabbed the coma man
in the head. he came back to life.

148
00:20:11.558 --> 00:20:13.690
But not before
he cleaned himself up.

149
00:20:13.864 --> 00:20:16.302
dressed himself again.
and then reappeared in his bed as if nothing ever happened.

150
00:20:16.476 --> 00:20:18.869
Okay. you are not
making me feel any better.

151
00:20:19.043 --> 00:20:22.917
So. what happens when
the not-zombies come back again?

152
00:20:23.091 --> 00:20:24.397
We'’ll be long gone.

153
00:20:25.441 --> 00:20:27.226
Put this on
in the meantime.

154
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.271
Play doctor with you?

155
00:20:29.445 --> 00:20:31.665
You know what?
In the past. that would'’ve been a really good idea.

156
00:20:32.535 --> 00:20:34.407
Look.
You get me out of here.

157
00:20:34.581 --> 00:20:36.887
and I will be more than happy
to play in this one.

158
00:20:38.324 --> 00:20:40.804
Lady. as tempting
as that offer sounds.

159
00:20:40.978 --> 00:20:43.111
I'’m married.
and I really want to get back to my wife.

160
00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:44.330
Hello?

161
00:20:45.156 --> 00:20:46.767
- Hello!
- Who'’s that?

162
00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:49.509
No. No!

163
00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:55.471
Anybody
out there? Hello?

164
00:20:56.385 --> 00:20:58.822
- Hello?
- Hello! Yes! In here!

165
00:21:00.084 --> 00:21:02.217
Oh. thank God.
I thought I was gonna die here.

166
00:21:02.391 --> 00:21:03.349
What happened?

167
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.481
The cops. t-t-the doctor.

168
00:21:05.655 --> 00:21:07.091
they all just left me
cuffed to this bed.

169
00:21:07.266 --> 00:21:08.615
What did you do?

170
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:10.617
Nothing! I was shot.
then brought here.

171
00:21:10.791 --> 00:21:12.140
and I woke up
just like this.

172
00:21:12.314 --> 00:21:13.272
It'’s pretty fucked up.
ain'’t it?

173
00:21:13.446 --> 00:21:14.882
Who shot you?

174
00:21:15.056 --> 00:21:18.059
- A cop.
- No. We are not helping him.

175
00:21:18.233 --> 00:21:20.931
What? N-N-No!
I'’m not the bad guy here. I swear!

176
00:21:21.932 --> 00:21:23.891
Hey! We need
to stick together.

177
00:21:24.065 --> 00:21:25.501
I helped you. didn'’t I?

178
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.374
Yeah. That'’s '’cause
I'’m not a criminal!

179
00:21:28.548 --> 00:21:29.940
Neither am I. lady!

180
00:21:33.248 --> 00:21:34.510
Stop!

181
00:21:34.684 --> 00:21:35.903
Stop!

182
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.560
I'’m Carter.

183
00:21:40.734 --> 00:21:42.257
Sam.

184
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:43.302
What'’s happening
out there?

185
00:21:43.476 --> 00:21:45.086
Nothing good.

186
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.044
We need to get to the lobby
and then the exit. Can you move?

187
00:21:47.218 --> 00:21:49.873
- Yeah.
- How do we know you'’re not gonna try and kill us?

188
00:21:50.047 --> 00:21:53.050
How do I know you'’re not
gonna try and kill me? I saw you swipe that scalpel.

189
00:21:53.224 --> 00:21:55.314
Hey! Nobody'’s
killing anyone.

190
00:21:56.358 --> 00:21:57.359
You'’re gonna need this.

191
00:21:57.533 --> 00:22:00.101
- Fuck.
- Shit! You okay?

192
00:22:00.275 --> 00:22:02.277
Yeah. I'’ll live.

193
00:22:02.451 --> 00:22:03.365
Let'’s go.

194
00:22:03.539 --> 00:22:04.627
Come on!

195
00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:11.765
You better
not try anything.

196
00:22:11.939 --> 00:22:13.506
Aw. give it a rest. lady.
You'’re not my type.

197
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.247
- Huh. Too pretty?
- Nah! Too extra. Damn.

198
00:22:34.614 --> 00:22:37.617
No!
Come on!

199
00:22:40.924 --> 00:22:42.099
Who the hell are they?

200
00:22:43.057 --> 00:22:44.406
Not-zombies.

201
00:22:58.289 --> 00:23:01.118
Shit! We'’re not gonna
make the elevator.

202
00:23:01.292 --> 00:23:03.382
Go for the stairs!
Move!

203
00:23:14.654 --> 00:23:15.698
It'’s not gonna hold!

204
00:23:15.872 --> 00:23:18.527
Go! Go!

205
00:23:29.364 --> 00:23:30.409
Let'’s go!

206
00:23:39.896 --> 00:23:40.941
Wait!

207
00:23:57.523 --> 00:23:59.046
You shouldn'’t be in there.

208
00:24:00.656 --> 00:24:02.223
There'’s smoke everywhere.

209
00:24:02.397 --> 00:24:03.529
There'’s gotta be
a fire somewhere.

210
00:24:03.703 --> 00:24:05.182
I saved you from it.

211
00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.926
My friends.
We have to help them.

212
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.015
They'’re not your friends.

213
00:24:12.189 --> 00:24:15.192
You can'’t go down after them.
You can'’t go anywhere.

214
00:24:15.366 --> 00:24:17.586
Or else you will be
lost forever.

215
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.196
Let go of me!

216
00:24:22.591 --> 00:24:24.071
He said let go of him!

217
00:24:34.777 --> 00:24:37.563
Hey. Stay with me.

218
00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:41.871
Stay with me.

219
00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:44.526
- Stay with me. Sam.
- Uh-huh.

220
00:24:45.266 --> 00:24:46.485
Welcome back.

221
00:24:46.659 --> 00:24:47.790
I'’m still here.

222
00:24:47.964 --> 00:24:49.531
Just trying to finish
some work.

223
00:24:49.705 --> 00:24:51.272
Oh. the horror

224
00:24:51.446 --> 00:24:53.187
of having to share
the morning commute with your wife.

225
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.105
It'’s a nightmare.

226
00:24:58.279 --> 00:24:59.846
But I'’ll get over it.

227
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.326
- Maybe even before
- the baby arrives. - Well. you better.

228
00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:04.241
Or else you'’re gonna
wake up an angry old man.

229
00:25:04.415 --> 00:25:08.507
with long. straggly hair.
crazy fingernails...

230
00:25:08.681 --> 00:25:11.031
I already wake up
an angry old man.

231
00:25:11.205 --> 00:25:13.729
And I'’d only be angry
if you weren'’t there.

232
00:25:15.426 --> 00:25:16.819
You work too much.

233
00:25:16.993 --> 00:25:18.604
Deep breaths.

234
00:25:18.778 --> 00:25:20.606
Stay the course.

235
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.390
Tomorrow is important.

236
00:25:22.564 --> 00:25:24.261
But so is today.

237
00:25:25.306 --> 00:25:28.352
Okay. That'’s it.
I'’m all yours.

238
00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:30.224
Sorry. Too late.

239
00:25:30.398 --> 00:25:31.355
Oh.

240
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.705
Love you.

241
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:36.752
No texting and driving.

242
00:25:36.926 --> 00:25:38.406
Only when
I'’m texting you.

243
00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.886
Not even then.

244
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.714
Do you remember
how to get back here tonight?

245
00:25:41.888 --> 00:25:44.020
Sure. GPS.

246
00:25:44.194 --> 00:25:45.500
Or you could
follow the signs.

247
00:25:45.674 --> 00:25:48.677
It'’s uptown.
not downtown. remember?

248
00:25:48.851 --> 00:25:50.897
I got it. Love you.

249
00:25:53.813 --> 00:25:56.467
- Call me if you get lost.
- Uh-huh.

250
00:26:07.304 --> 00:26:08.218
Hey.

251
00:26:08.392 --> 00:26:09.437
Okay. Sam...

252
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.712
I should just take him
downstairs right now.

253
00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:26.149
Not as long as
I'’m here. you won'’t.

254
00:26:26.323 --> 00:26:28.804
He'’s a selfish. workaholic.
reckless womanizer

255
00:26:28.978 --> 00:26:30.545
who crashed
while texting and driving.

256
00:26:30.719 --> 00:26:33.330
You mean a good.
hardworking man

257
00:26:33.504 --> 00:26:35.202
and future father
who made some mistakes.

258
00:26:35.376 --> 00:26:36.507
who got hit
by a drunk driver.

259
00:26:36.682 --> 00:26:39.119
Fine.
It'’ll be his choice.

260
00:26:39.293 --> 00:26:40.860
Always.

261
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:08.931
Oh!

262
00:27:09.105 --> 00:27:10.672
Fuck.

263
00:28:35.452 --> 00:28:36.845
Drop the wrench.

264
00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:40.283
Are you one of them?

265
00:28:40.457 --> 00:28:41.676
One of who?

266
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.983
Whoever the hell
is trying to stop me

267
00:28:44.157 --> 00:28:45.724
from getting
out of this place.

268
00:28:51.164 --> 00:28:52.208
No.

269
00:28:52.992 --> 00:28:54.471
Do I look like one of them?

270
00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:56.822
Yeah. you got a face.

271
00:28:56.996 --> 00:28:58.606
That'’s a positive.

272
00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.043
I'’m assuming
you'’re not the one who patched me up.

273
00:29:01.783 --> 00:29:03.089
No. It wasn'’t me.

274
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:06.962
You'’re a cop.

275
00:29:07.136 --> 00:29:08.703
Yeah.

276
00:29:10.313 --> 00:29:12.228
So what the hell
is going on?

277
00:29:13.403 --> 00:29:15.362
I don'’t know.
I can'’t get a signal.

278
00:29:15.536 --> 00:29:18.757
Neither can I.
All the lines are dead.

279
00:29:20.671 --> 00:29:22.630
Look. I sign
every birthday card.

280
00:29:22.804 --> 00:29:24.501
"See you at a hundred."

281
00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:26.286
I'’m gettin'’ out of this place.
no matter what it takes.

282
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.984
Hey. look!
You'’ll get no argument from me.

283
00:29:29.158 --> 00:29:30.681
But the exit
is in the lobby.

284
00:29:30.856 --> 00:29:33.510
and let me tell you.
the elevator is dangerous.

285
00:29:33.684 --> 00:29:35.382
And there'’s smoke
all over the stairs.

286
00:29:35.556 --> 00:29:37.079
I think there'’s
a fire somewhere.

287
00:29:39.734 --> 00:29:41.910
Have you looked
out a window yet?

288
00:29:42.084 --> 00:29:43.259
What?

289
00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:09.546
Hey. boss.

290
00:30:16.031 --> 00:30:19.165
Yeah. I know it'’s
a bit of a stereotype. but I like '’em.

291
00:30:19.339 --> 00:30:21.776
Can I grab
a coffee there. as well?

292
00:30:30.872 --> 00:30:32.091
Hoodie.

293
00:30:38.967 --> 00:30:40.273
Don'’t move!

294
00:30:40.447 --> 00:30:41.883
Hands where I can see '’em!

295
00:30:42.057 --> 00:30:44.494
Down on your knees!
I'’m not gonna ask again!

296
00:30:44.668 --> 00:30:46.322
- Now.
- It'’s not him.

297
00:30:46.496 --> 00:30:47.715
You got the wrong guy. dude.

298
00:30:52.154 --> 00:30:53.982
Maybe it'’s a blackout.

299
00:30:54.156 --> 00:30:55.592
Maybe the whole
grid is down.

300
00:30:55.766 --> 00:30:58.508
What do you--
What do you mean. like terrorists?

301
00:30:58.682 --> 00:31:00.684
Or hackers.

302
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:04.210
All hospitals have generators.
That would explain why we still have power.

303
00:31:04.384 --> 00:31:07.996
Maybe they evacuated everybody
before the generators kicked in.

304
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.042
That'’s why
the hospital'’s empty.

305
00:31:15.743 --> 00:31:17.005
Seriously?

306
00:31:22.445 --> 00:31:23.490
Hey!

307
00:31:40.463 --> 00:31:41.421
Fuck!

308
00:31:46.774 --> 00:31:48.558
Whoa! Slow down there. son.

309
00:31:48.732 --> 00:31:50.473
You'’re gonna open up
those stitches.

310
00:32:04.444 --> 00:32:06.576
Unless. of course.
you'’re here to fix my sink.

311
00:32:08.491 --> 00:32:09.753
What?

312
00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:11.538
Well. you got a pretty
big wrench there.

313
00:32:11.712 --> 00:32:13.583
I was thinking. you know.
my sink'’s leaking.

314
00:32:13.757 --> 00:32:14.933
Maybe you could. uh...

315
00:32:15.107 --> 00:32:16.151
No.

316
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.111
I don'’t fix sinks.

317
00:32:21.983 --> 00:32:23.811
Are you real?

318
00:32:23.985 --> 00:32:25.813
I mean. are you really here?

319
00:32:25.987 --> 00:32:28.120
Of course. I'’m here!
Aren'’t you?

320
00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:30.470
Yes.

321
00:32:30.644 --> 00:32:32.472
Thank God.

322
00:32:34.126 --> 00:32:35.997
People keep
disappearing on me.

323
00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:39.087
Well. I'’m not going
anywhere. son.

324
00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:40.741
Name'’s Virgil.

325
00:32:43.309 --> 00:32:44.832
Sam.

326
00:32:45.006 --> 00:32:47.443
Sam. huh?
Why are you still here. Sam?

327
00:32:48.923 --> 00:32:50.490
I'’m trying to leave.

328
00:32:50.664 --> 00:32:52.840
I need to find my wife.
She'’s pregnant.

329
00:32:53.014 --> 00:32:54.407
But I keep
getting attacked.

330
00:32:54.581 --> 00:32:55.886
Yeah.

331
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:59.368
Well. you were bleeding
pretty badly there.

332
00:33:00.456 --> 00:33:01.936
Yeah. the. uh.
the wrench lady

333
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.677
took you to that
room over there.

334
00:33:03.851 --> 00:33:05.809
and wanted to move
you downstairs.

335
00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.289
but. uh...

336
00:33:07.463 --> 00:33:08.812
...I wouldn'’t let her.

337
00:33:09.857 --> 00:33:11.163
She'’s the one
who saved me?

338
00:33:11.337 --> 00:33:12.991
She'’s the one
who stitched you up.

339
00:33:13.165 --> 00:33:16.472
And apparently.
uh. let you borrow her wrench.

340
00:33:16.646 --> 00:33:18.257
So where is she now?

341
00:33:18.431 --> 00:33:20.215
We need to get
out of here.

342
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:23.088
I think there'’s a fire.
or a blackout. or worse.

343
00:33:23.262 --> 00:33:24.176
Worse?

344
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:25.742
Well.
power'’s still on.

345
00:33:25.916 --> 00:33:27.048
Water'’s still running.

346
00:33:27.222 --> 00:33:29.050
We'’re both
still breathin'’.

347
00:33:29.224 --> 00:33:30.965
I'’d say
we'’re doing okay.

348
00:33:31.139 --> 00:33:34.273
Virgil.
I looked out the window.

349
00:33:35.535 --> 00:33:36.753
There'’s only darkness.

350
00:33:36.927 --> 00:33:39.365
And it'’s light in here.

351
00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:41.976
In a couple of hours.
the sun will come up.

352
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.717
It'’ll be light
out there. too.

353
00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:46.067
Assuming we
survive the night.

354
00:33:46.241 --> 00:33:48.200
I can'’t explain this.

355
00:33:48.374 --> 00:33:50.767
but there are
dangerous things here.

356
00:33:50.941 --> 00:33:52.726
and they mean
to do us harm.

357
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.815
I know.
I'’ve seen them.

358
00:33:54.989 --> 00:33:56.686
- You have?
- Yeah.

359
00:33:59.472 --> 00:34:02.040
I thought
I was going crazy.

360
00:34:02.214 --> 00:34:04.564
Monica.
one of the other patients.

361
00:34:04.738 --> 00:34:06.827
she thought it even
might be the apocalypse.

362
00:34:07.001 --> 00:34:08.742
The apocalypse?

363
00:34:09.786 --> 00:34:11.397
I don'’t think
that'’s what'’s going on.

364
00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:13.268
No one can get
a phone signal.

365
00:34:13.442 --> 00:34:16.880
Well. these old buildings
wreak havoc with reception.

366
00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:19.622
But I'’ll tell you what.
the higher up you go. the better chance you have.

367
00:34:22.408 --> 00:34:23.757
What about the roof?

368
00:34:24.714 --> 00:34:26.586
Now. that makes sense.

369
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.068
Go up on the roof. get a signal.
find out what'’s going on. and...

370
00:34:31.025 --> 00:34:32.287
talk to your wife.

371
00:34:34.681 --> 00:34:37.075
Virgil. we'’re
getting outta here.

372
00:34:44.212 --> 00:34:45.605
There you are.

373
00:34:47.694 --> 00:34:49.478
Glad to see you
on your feet again.

374
00:34:50.218 --> 00:34:51.176
You helped me.

375
00:34:53.134 --> 00:34:55.354
Thank you.

376
00:34:55.528 --> 00:34:56.703
Thank me later.

377
00:34:57.965 --> 00:34:59.923
Did you just hear
those gunshots?

378
00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:01.142
Yeah.

379
00:35:01.316 --> 00:35:03.144
There'’s a cop.

380
00:35:03.318 --> 00:35:06.626
He said he'’d do
anything it takes to get out of here alive.

381
00:35:07.409 --> 00:35:08.628
I like him already.

382
00:35:09.542 --> 00:35:10.630
Let'’s follow his lead.

383
00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:13.372
Can I have my wrench back?

384
00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:18.986
Yes. ma'’am.

385
00:35:20.292 --> 00:35:21.641
It'’s Doctor.

386
00:35:21.815 --> 00:35:24.296
Or Lily.
But not "Lilith."

387
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:25.949
I hate that name.

388
00:35:27.647 --> 00:35:29.214
Whatever you say. Doctor.

389
00:35:50.931 --> 00:35:53.325
No. shooting first
and asking questions later

390
00:35:53.499 --> 00:35:55.022
is not what we need right now.

391
00:35:56.545 --> 00:35:58.547
The cop did seem a little off.

392
00:35:58.721 --> 00:36:01.159
Really?
We'’ve been abandoned. the phones are dead.

393
00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:03.857
and there are
crazy monster-people trying to kill us.

394
00:36:04.031 --> 00:36:05.554
I'’m "off" too.

395
00:36:05.728 --> 00:36:07.469
We all are.

396
00:36:07.643 --> 00:36:09.645
I woke up from a nap
in the break room.

397
00:36:09.819 --> 00:36:11.430
and everyone was gone.

398
00:36:11.604 --> 00:36:13.171
except for Virgil.

399
00:36:13.345 --> 00:36:14.694
And then I saw
you getting attacked

400
00:36:14.868 --> 00:36:16.957
by a faceless orderly.

401
00:36:19.046 --> 00:36:20.439
Me and two patients...

402
00:36:21.701 --> 00:36:22.876
we tried the stairs.

403
00:36:24.051 --> 00:36:25.487
They were filled with smoke.

404
00:36:25.661 --> 00:36:28.229
The orderly pulled me out.

405
00:36:29.317 --> 00:36:31.493
Then let'’s hope
the elevator still works.

406
00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:33.103
We want to go up to the roof.

407
00:36:33.278 --> 00:36:34.844
especially if there'’s a fire.

408
00:36:35.018 --> 00:36:37.891
Fire or no fire.
we need to go down.

409
00:36:38.065 --> 00:36:40.285
Find the exit.
Find everyone else.

410
00:36:52.384 --> 00:36:54.342
The orderly'’s back.

411
00:36:54.516 --> 00:36:55.865
And he'’s found
his face again.

412
00:37:00.348 --> 00:37:03.264
He looks in pretty
good shape for getting a wrench to the head.

413
00:37:03.438 --> 00:37:06.093
- Yeah.
- Perhaps you should try talking to him

414
00:37:06.267 --> 00:37:08.182
before bashing him
in the head again. hmm?

415
00:37:08.356 --> 00:37:10.097
Talk to the man
with the vanishing mouth?

416
00:37:10.271 --> 00:37:12.012
She'’s right.

417
00:37:12.186 --> 00:37:13.927
That didn'’t work so well
the last time.

418
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:15.624
Oh. was that
before or after

419
00:37:15.798 --> 00:37:17.452
he pulled you from
the smoking stairwell?

420
00:37:18.627 --> 00:37:19.672
Touché.

421
00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:23.893
You stay here.

422
00:37:24.067 --> 00:37:26.287
If he tries anything.

423
00:37:26.461 --> 00:37:27.462
bash him.

424
00:37:43.739 --> 00:37:44.958
Hello?

425
00:37:53.053 --> 00:37:55.273
My friends and I
would like to leave now.

426
00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:45.235
Help me!

427
00:38:51.546 --> 00:38:52.678
Wait!

428
00:38:57.465 --> 00:38:58.510
What happened?

429
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.208
Did you see the girl?

430
00:39:01.382 --> 00:39:04.037
What girl?

431
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:07.345
Come on.

432
00:39:12.175 --> 00:39:13.916
You shouldn'’t be here.

433
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:15.353
We'’re leaving now.

434
00:39:15.527 --> 00:39:17.355
You shouldn'’t be with her.

435
00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:22.098
You shouldn'’t be with her!

436
00:39:22.272 --> 00:39:24.579
This conversation is over.

437
00:39:29.541 --> 00:39:33.327
Going downstairs
is a mistake that you will regret!

438
00:39:36.635 --> 00:39:37.549
Let him go!

439
00:39:43.903 --> 00:39:46.166
Get up to the roof!
Get help!

440
00:39:48.603 --> 00:39:50.083
No!

441
00:39:51.345 --> 00:39:54.000
Come on.

442
00:39:56.132 --> 00:39:57.220
We can'’t leave him!

443
00:39:59.048 --> 00:40:00.310
Crap.

444
00:40:00.485 --> 00:40:01.573
Virgil!

445
00:40:04.489 --> 00:40:06.926
Virgil? Virgil!

446
00:40:10.669 --> 00:40:12.410
Sam!

447
00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:15.456
Lily. I'’m sorry.

448
00:40:17.284 --> 00:40:19.155
We have to go. Ready?

449
00:40:21.288 --> 00:40:22.332
Let'’s go!

450
00:40:29.688 --> 00:40:31.341
We'’re supposed
to go to the roof.

451
00:40:31.516 --> 00:40:33.605
That doesn'’t make any sense.
We need to get out of here.

452
00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:43.179
No! Let me go!

453
00:40:43.353 --> 00:40:44.920
- Help!
- Lily!

454
00:40:45.094 --> 00:40:46.444
- Sam!
- Lily!

455
00:40:46.966 --> 00:40:48.446
Fuck!

456
00:41:29.487 --> 00:41:31.706
I promise you.
I didn'’t call her.

457
00:41:35.667 --> 00:41:37.495
You fucked up once.

458
00:41:38.974 --> 00:41:40.236
Don'’t do it again.

459
00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.022
- I'’m sorry.
- Temptation is your weakness.

460
00:41:43.196 --> 00:41:44.676
Was my weakness.

461
00:41:46.678 --> 00:41:48.680
Look.
I'’m a different guy now.

462
00:41:53.075 --> 00:41:54.903
I'’m different now.

463
00:41:55.077 --> 00:41:56.514
I changed.

464
00:41:57.819 --> 00:41:59.691
You made me
a better person.

465
00:41:59.865 --> 00:42:02.345
I know who I married.

466
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.478
but it doesn'’t always
have to be about you.

467
00:42:04.652 --> 00:42:06.785
what you want.
what you need.

468
00:42:06.959 --> 00:42:10.266
I know.
Look. I'’m selfish.

469
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.225
You don'’t have to be.

470
00:42:13.095 --> 00:42:14.096
Look.

471
00:42:15.576 --> 00:42:18.710
I'’m sorry. I get lost.
I get distracted. I get tempted.

472
00:42:18.884 --> 00:42:20.712
I don'’t know
what the fuck I'’m doing.

473
00:42:21.669 --> 00:42:23.410
But I don'’t
want to lose you.

474
00:42:24.019 --> 00:42:25.107
I'’m right here.

475
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:26.544
I know.

476
00:42:27.806 --> 00:42:30.809
Our future child
is right here.

477
00:42:30.983 --> 00:42:31.984
I know.

478
00:42:34.769 --> 00:42:36.292
You'’re always trying
to help yourself.

479
00:42:37.685 --> 00:42:39.905
When are you gonna try
and help someone else?

480
00:42:40.688 --> 00:42:42.037
I'’m sorry.

481
00:43:05.104 --> 00:43:07.019
Who'’s chasing you?

482
00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:13.678
A ten-foot orderly
with no fuckin'’ face.

483
00:43:13.852 --> 00:43:16.376
Oh. So nothing crazy.

484
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.899
I thought I'’d lost you.

485
00:43:19.248 --> 00:43:20.554
You did.

486
00:43:21.511 --> 00:43:22.425
We'’re all lost.

487
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.645
There'’s no way out. Sam.

488
00:43:25.385 --> 00:43:26.647
We looked and looked.

489
00:43:26.821 --> 00:43:28.606
Carter left me
and he'’s still looking.

490
00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.216
But there'’s
no exit anywhere.

491
00:43:33.132 --> 00:43:34.655
Now you listen to me.

492
00:43:35.656 --> 00:43:37.615
You don'’t give up.

493
00:43:37.789 --> 00:43:39.312
There'’s always a way out.

494
00:43:40.226 --> 00:43:41.836
We just have to find
the lobby.

495
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.491
This is the lobby.

496
00:43:52.804 --> 00:43:54.153
Oh. shit.

497
00:44:26.185 --> 00:44:27.882
Sam!

498
00:44:31.059 --> 00:44:32.713
- What'’s going on?
- Someone'’s coming!

499
00:44:32.887 --> 00:44:33.801
Shh.

500
00:44:48.207 --> 00:44:50.165
Faceless.
and now headless.

501
00:44:51.471 --> 00:44:52.820
You got away.

502
00:44:52.994 --> 00:44:54.213
He stuck his head
where it shouldn'’t be.

503
00:44:54.387 --> 00:44:56.171
The elevator doors
did the rest.

504
00:44:56.345 --> 00:44:58.173
I told you
they weren'’t safe.

505
00:44:58.347 --> 00:44:59.871
Who'’s your friend?

506
00:45:01.873 --> 00:45:05.877
Dr. Lily. Monica.
Monica. this is Dr. Lily.

507
00:45:06.051 --> 00:45:08.662
I'’m the one he was
playing doctor with before he met you.

508
00:45:09.532 --> 00:45:10.533
We'’re not playing.

509
00:45:15.669 --> 00:45:17.497
Son of a bitch!

510
00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:20.630
Hey!

511
00:45:24.199 --> 00:45:27.681
This is the lobby. isn'’t it?
So where are the main doors?

512
00:45:36.429 --> 00:45:37.473
What the...

513
00:45:51.226 --> 00:45:53.751
Well. at least we know
the air outside is real.

514
00:45:56.362 --> 00:45:59.452
Just checked the whole floor.
No exit doors anywhere.

515
00:45:59.626 --> 00:46:01.367
- You okay?
- Thankfully.

516
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:03.369
Hey!

517
00:46:03.543 --> 00:46:05.458
You'’re the son of a bitch
who shot me!

518
00:46:05.632 --> 00:46:06.981
I knew it!

519
00:46:07.155 --> 00:46:10.028
I didn'’t shoot you.
you profiling asshole!

520
00:46:10.202 --> 00:46:11.203
- Hey!
- You shot me!

521
00:46:11.377 --> 00:46:12.508
Whoa.

522
00:46:12.682 --> 00:46:15.773
Take it easy. Hey!
Put the gun down.

523
00:46:15.947 --> 00:46:17.644
Your partner may have
pulled the trigger.

524
00:46:17.818 --> 00:46:19.602
but that'’s the same
in the eyes of the law.

525
00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:20.821
My partner?

526
00:46:20.995 --> 00:46:22.997
He was not my partner!

527
00:46:23.171 --> 00:46:26.696
You just assume every Black
dude in a goddamn hoodie is a fucking criminal!

528
00:46:26.871 --> 00:46:28.350
What.
now you'’re the victim?

529
00:46:29.699 --> 00:46:32.050
Give me the fucking money! Now!Whoa. whoa!

530
00:46:34.052 --> 00:46:35.053
Hurry up.

531
00:46:35.967 --> 00:46:37.707
Move. and you die.

532
00:46:40.972 --> 00:46:42.756
Can I grab a coffee there
as well?

533
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:44.714
Hoodie.

534
00:46:45.846 --> 00:46:46.760
Don'’t move!

535
00:46:46.934 --> 00:46:48.327
Hands where I can see '’em!

536
00:46:48.501 --> 00:46:49.807
No. no...

537
00:46:49.981 --> 00:46:51.330
- Now!
- It'’s not him.

538
00:46:51.504 --> 00:46:52.810
- Now!
- You got the wrong guy. dude.

539
00:46:54.594 --> 00:46:56.030
Put your hands
behind your head.

540
00:46:56.204 --> 00:46:58.032
Get down on your fucking knees.

541
00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:00.818
Look out!

542
00:47:13.613 --> 00:47:14.657
I'’m sorry.

543
00:47:30.456 --> 00:47:31.718
He'’s getting away!

544
00:47:34.286 --> 00:47:35.243
Stop!

545
00:47:37.985 --> 00:47:39.334
Yeah. well. no shit.

546
00:47:39.508 --> 00:47:41.380
And so was the innocent lady
standing next to me.

547
00:47:41.554 --> 00:47:45.123
Hey! Nobody
is killing anybody.

548
00:47:45.819 --> 00:47:47.038
We'’re on the same side.

549
00:47:47.212 --> 00:47:48.953
No. no.
We'’re far from that.

550
00:47:49.127 --> 00:47:50.780
The Internet is down.

551
00:47:50.955 --> 00:47:52.739
All the landlines are dead.
There'’s no cell-phone signal.

552
00:47:52.913 --> 00:47:54.697
and none of us have found
a door to get outta here.

553
00:47:54.872 --> 00:47:56.482
and there'’s fucking creatures
trying to kill us!

554
00:47:56.656 --> 00:48:00.225
So I'’d say you. me and him--
we'’re on the same side.

555
00:48:07.275 --> 00:48:08.711
This is impossible.

556
00:48:09.712 --> 00:48:10.757
Hey.

557
00:48:11.801 --> 00:48:12.715
You'’re a cop.

558
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.282
You'’re a logical guy.

559
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.416
If what we'’re seeing
is impossible.

560
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.592
maybe we'’re
not seeing it right.

561
00:48:20.158 --> 00:48:21.333
Lily.

562
00:48:22.421 --> 00:48:23.988
What did you give me upstairs?

563
00:48:24.162 --> 00:48:26.120
Antibiotics. adrenaline.

564
00:48:26.294 --> 00:48:27.643
You needed them.

565
00:48:27.817 --> 00:48:29.080
The pills are for the pain.

566
00:48:29.254 --> 00:48:31.560
I saw some empty vials
when I woke up.

567
00:48:31.734 --> 00:48:32.866
Maybe we were all drugged?

568
00:48:33.867 --> 00:48:35.303
Was I drugged. too.
in this scenario?

569
00:48:36.087 --> 00:48:37.784
Maybe.

570
00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:41.222
You told me you woke up from
a long nap in the break room.

571
00:48:41.396 --> 00:48:43.094
Anything could have happened.

572
00:48:43.268 --> 00:48:45.357
And now we'’re all having the
same hallucinogenic nightmare?

573
00:48:45.531 --> 00:48:48.969
Or maybe one of us is having
a hallucinogenic nightmare

574
00:48:49.143 --> 00:48:52.886
and the rest of us
are just figments of his or her imagination.

575
00:48:55.497 --> 00:48:57.586
Or maybe
we'’re all already dead.

576
00:48:58.761 --> 00:49:00.589
Oh. come on.
That'’s bullshit.

577
00:49:00.763 --> 00:49:02.896
How can you be so sure?

578
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:04.680
Because
you'’re still breathing...

579
00:49:05.768 --> 00:49:06.813
and bleeding.

580
00:49:09.381 --> 00:49:11.818
None of us are dead.

581
00:49:11.992 --> 00:49:14.908
But this will not end well
unless we work together.

582
00:49:15.082 --> 00:49:18.085
I still don'’t trust him.
He was handcuffed for a reason!

583
00:49:18.259 --> 00:49:20.305
Yeah.
'’cause he'’s a criminal.

584
00:49:20.479 --> 00:49:22.176
Yeah. that'’s exactly
what we need.

585
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:25.005
another racist pig
with a fucking gun!

586
00:49:30.706 --> 00:49:34.797
- What did you do?
- Hey! He is the reason that I'’m here.

587
00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:37.061
He doesn'’t get to leave.
but I do.

588
00:49:37.235 --> 00:49:39.672
- You killed him?
- Yeah! I killed him!

589
00:49:39.846 --> 00:49:43.415
'’Cause he'’s a criminal.
and he'’d have killed us if he had the chance!

590
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:46.766
Okay? I'’m not dying
here. Not today.

591
00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:52.467
You. You work
here. right?

592
00:49:52.641 --> 00:49:54.513
How did you get in
if there'’s no doors?

593
00:49:54.687 --> 00:49:57.255
Through a door. asshole.

594
00:50:00.258 --> 00:50:03.000
Then take us to it.
Now!

595
00:50:04.305 --> 00:50:05.219
Let'’s go.

596
00:50:05.393 --> 00:50:06.655
Calm the fuck down.

597
00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:08.744
Let'’s go.

598
00:50:10.572 --> 00:50:12.835
I came in through
the employee parking garage.

599
00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:14.707
Basement level.

600
00:50:15.403 --> 00:50:17.014
Elevator or stairs?

601
00:50:17.188 --> 00:50:19.494
I took the elevator
straight up to my floor.

602
00:50:19.668 --> 00:50:21.148
All right.
assuming there is one.

603
00:50:21.322 --> 00:50:23.150
why didn'’t you come through
the main entrance?

604
00:50:23.324 --> 00:50:24.543
Because I have a car.

605
00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:27.763
She knows something
she'’s not telling.

606
00:50:27.937 --> 00:50:29.809
Like. why this lobby
has no doors.

607
00:50:29.983 --> 00:50:31.898
I was only filling in today.

608
00:50:32.072 --> 00:50:33.552
First time at this hospital.

609
00:50:34.553 --> 00:50:36.381
All right. basement it is.

610
00:50:39.862 --> 00:50:40.907
Wait.

611
00:50:43.214 --> 00:50:44.476
Where'’s the head?

612
00:50:46.347 --> 00:50:48.654
It was lying right here!

613
00:50:49.959 --> 00:50:51.048
It was here.

614
00:50:54.225 --> 00:50:56.488
Oh. shit!

615
00:50:57.315 --> 00:50:58.838
- Monica!
- Sam! Sam!

616
00:50:59.012 --> 00:51:00.057
Stay with me.

617
00:51:01.884 --> 00:51:03.103
We can'’t leave her.

618
00:51:04.061 --> 00:51:05.323
I'’m sorry. Lily.

619
00:51:05.497 --> 00:51:06.498
Monica!

620
00:51:06.672 --> 00:51:08.674
Hey. Mon-- Monica!

621
00:51:09.588 --> 00:51:10.632
Hey.

622
00:51:12.852 --> 00:51:14.071
You okay?

623
00:51:15.072 --> 00:51:17.552
This must be hell.

624
00:51:17.726 --> 00:51:19.728
No. it'’s not.

625
00:51:19.902 --> 00:51:20.990
This is a hospital.

626
00:51:21.165 --> 00:51:22.427
There'’s no way
out of here.

627
00:51:22.601 --> 00:51:23.428
Yes. there is.

628
00:51:23.602 --> 00:51:25.995
Monica. look at me.

629
00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:28.607
You have to trust Dr. Lily.
She knows a way out.

630
00:51:28.781 --> 00:51:30.609
What the fuck
is happening?

631
00:51:32.306 --> 00:51:34.439
Look. maybe--
maybe Carter was right.

632
00:51:34.613 --> 00:51:36.354
Look. maybe
we were drugged.

633
00:51:36.528 --> 00:51:39.400
But the longer we stay here.
the worse it'’s gonna get for us.

634
00:51:39.574 --> 00:51:41.141
We have to reach
the outside.

635
00:51:41.315 --> 00:51:43.665
We can get out through
the basement garage.

636
00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:45.885
The way I came in.
I promise.

637
00:51:46.059 --> 00:51:47.626
How?

638
00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.498
You know what'’s
waiting for us in those stairs.

639
00:51:50.672 --> 00:51:52.326
And we can'’t go back
to that elevator.

640
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.850
No. Not that elevator.

641
00:51:55.982 --> 00:51:58.463
I know another one.
Come on.

642
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:06.819
How'’d you know
this was here?

643
00:52:06.993 --> 00:52:08.255
I'’ve been here before.

644
00:52:08.429 --> 00:52:09.996
When I first woke up.

645
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:11.998
It didn'’t go well.

646
00:52:12.172 --> 00:52:14.131
You said
we couldn'’t use this one

647
00:52:14.305 --> 00:52:16.045
because of
a homicidal coma man.

648
00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.004
Yeah. well. we have to.

649
00:52:18.178 --> 00:52:20.485
Let'’s hope
the homicidal coma man doesn'’t try to stop us.

650
00:52:21.703 --> 00:52:23.488
Get ready.

651
00:52:33.889 --> 00:52:34.977
Coma man?

652
00:52:36.675 --> 00:52:37.719
Yeah.

653
00:52:40.418 --> 00:52:43.595
You know.
too many of those pills can cause hallucinations.

654
00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.250
How many did you take?

655
00:52:47.338 --> 00:52:48.861
Not enough for this place.

656
00:52:51.559 --> 00:52:52.865
Excuse me.

657
00:53:13.277 --> 00:53:15.366
So where'’s this
parking garage. Doctor?

658
00:53:16.193 --> 00:53:17.716
It should be
down this hall.

659
00:53:21.241 --> 00:53:22.242
Guys?

660
00:53:23.287 --> 00:53:24.288
The morgue.

661
00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:26.246
Fitting.

662
00:53:27.334 --> 00:53:29.162
since we'’re all
probably dead.

663
00:53:34.863 --> 00:53:36.213
Hey. Monica.

664
00:53:40.173 --> 00:53:41.696
We need to keep moving.

665
00:53:52.098 --> 00:53:54.143
None of these people
made it out.

666
00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:57.582
Unfortunately.
not everyone gets to choose

667
00:53:57.756 --> 00:53:58.800
how they leave a hospital.

668
00:53:59.497 --> 00:54:00.802
I got to choose.

669
00:54:01.586 --> 00:54:03.805
To be here. I mean.

670
00:54:05.111 --> 00:54:07.418
I even paid
a lot of money to do it.

671
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.857
For the chance to look...

672
00:54:13.162 --> 00:54:14.729
perfect.

673
00:54:27.046 --> 00:54:28.482
Monica.
what are you doing?

674
00:54:41.452 --> 00:54:43.454
I came in
for breast enhancement.

675
00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:46.631
But there'’s no incisions.

676
00:54:47.458 --> 00:54:48.546
No scars.

677
00:54:49.547 --> 00:54:51.157
No nothing.

678
00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:53.855
Maybe what happened
happened before you had the surgery.

679
00:54:55.901 --> 00:54:57.032
Maybe.

680
00:55:00.253 --> 00:55:02.429
But they'’ve never
looked this good.

681
00:55:04.692 --> 00:55:06.912
Hey. guys.
I got a dial tone.

682
00:55:08.043 --> 00:55:09.741
Hello? 911?

683
00:55:09.915 --> 00:55:12.221
911.
What'’s your emergency?

684
00:55:12.396 --> 00:55:16.530
Thank God.
Um. we'’re stuck in a hospital. It'’s an abandoned hospital.

685
00:55:16.704 --> 00:55:19.228
Somewhere in the city.
We'’re in the basement morgue.

686
00:55:19.403 --> 00:55:21.274
We'’re trying
to find the exit. I can'’t hear you. sir.

687
00:55:21.448 --> 00:55:23.320
Can you give me
an address? Hello?

688
00:55:23.494 --> 00:55:25.409
Hello! Hello?
Can you hear me?

689
00:55:25.583 --> 00:55:27.628
We'’re in a fuckin'’ hospital. Where. sir?

690
00:55:27.802 --> 00:55:31.676
I-I don'’t know where it is.
It'’s downtown. Um. somewhere in the city.

691
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:32.851
Trace the call!

692
00:55:33.025 --> 00:55:35.244
Hello!

693
00:55:35.419 --> 00:55:36.724
Hel--

694
00:55:40.598 --> 00:55:41.686
Fuck.

695
00:55:46.212 --> 00:55:47.431
Sam?

696
00:56:05.753 --> 00:56:10.541
Whatever attacked me in that elevator is dead.

697
00:56:10.715 --> 00:56:12.804
Okay? Th-Th--
They'’re all dead.

698
00:56:14.545 --> 00:56:16.721
But we'’re not. Yet.

699
00:56:18.026 --> 00:56:20.028
Ain'’t that right. Doctor? Huh?

700
00:56:20.202 --> 00:56:25.860
Especially since
my gunshot wound is no longer there.

701
00:56:26.034 --> 00:56:27.732
I wouldn'’t get too excited.

702
00:56:27.906 --> 00:56:30.517
Looks like you still
have plenty of injuries to worry about.

703
00:56:30.691 --> 00:56:32.084
Yeah. maybe.

704
00:56:32.258 --> 00:56:36.262
But. like I asked you before.
take me to the exit.

705
00:56:37.872 --> 00:56:38.917
Now.

706
00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:51.843
This better be the way.

707
00:56:52.757 --> 00:56:54.585
It is.

708
00:56:54.759 --> 00:56:57.152
She'’s been trying
to get me out of here since I first met her.

709
00:56:57.326 --> 00:56:59.198
Oh. yeah?
Then why are you still here?

710
00:57:04.464 --> 00:57:05.552
That'’s why.

711
00:57:09.556 --> 00:57:12.559
I know of only one way out.
and there it is.

712
00:57:13.604 --> 00:57:15.562
Well. you guys
do what you want.

713
00:57:15.736 --> 00:57:17.042
I'’m going down there.

714
00:57:17.216 --> 00:57:18.565
See you at a hundred.

715
00:57:20.045 --> 00:57:20.959
I'’m with him!

716
00:57:21.133 --> 00:57:22.482
What about the fire?

717
00:57:22.656 --> 00:57:24.397
I'’m more scared of staying here.

718
00:57:24.571 --> 00:57:27.966
This is the way I came.
I know my way back. Trust me. Sam.

719
00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:30.011
You sure we can make it?

720
00:57:30.185 --> 00:57:31.448
If we stick together.

721
00:57:37.628 --> 00:57:38.933
There'’s got to be
another way.

722
00:57:39.107 --> 00:57:40.457
There'’s gotta be
another exit.

723
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:41.936
We can make it. Sam.

724
00:57:44.286 --> 00:57:45.592
Fuck.

725
00:57:45.766 --> 00:57:47.159
Okay. let'’s go.

726
00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:01.913
No. No!

727
00:58:38.689 --> 00:58:39.646
No!

728
00:58:51.615 --> 00:58:53.181
I told you.

729
00:58:53.355 --> 00:58:57.316
I am getting out of here.
No matter what it takes!

730
00:59:07.805 --> 00:59:09.850
Guys! The elevator!

731
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.767
Carter'’s body is gone again.

732
00:59:18.337 --> 00:59:21.079
Now'’s our chance.
while that thing is occupied.

733
00:59:21.253 --> 00:59:23.516
Did you not just see
what happened?

734
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:26.475
Monica! Go for the stairs!

735
00:59:28.869 --> 00:59:30.001
Leave her.

736
00:59:30.175 --> 00:59:32.003
You and I can
get out together.

737
00:59:33.091 --> 00:59:34.614
I can'’t do that.

738
00:59:35.528 --> 00:59:37.443
We need to go
for the stairs.

739
00:59:37.617 --> 00:59:38.836
Come on.

740
00:59:40.185 --> 00:59:41.969
No. The exit.

741
00:59:46.365 --> 00:59:47.932
You'’re one of them.

742
00:59:49.498 --> 00:59:50.543
No.

743
00:59:51.588 --> 00:59:52.676
You'’re one of them.

744
00:59:53.938 --> 00:59:55.853
And there'’s only
one way out.

745
00:59:56.897 --> 00:59:58.812
Make that two ways.

746
00:59:59.552 --> 01:00:00.684
Virgil.

747
01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.947
Monica! Look at me.

748
01:00:03.121 --> 01:00:04.601
We gotta go. baby.
Come on.

749
01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:06.951
Go for the stairs.

750
01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:09.736
- I'’m so sorry. Sam.
- Don'’t be sorry.

751
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:10.911
For all of it.

752
01:00:14.872 --> 01:00:15.786
Monica!

753
01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.137
Monica.

754
01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:20.791
Sam.

755
01:00:26.405 --> 01:00:27.449
You.

756
01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:29.582
I trusted you.

757
01:00:44.815 --> 01:00:45.990
Fuck.

758
01:01:01.919 --> 01:01:03.442
Monica was right.

759
01:01:05.009 --> 01:01:06.140
This is hell.

760
01:01:06.314 --> 01:01:09.666
No. It isn'’t hell or heaven

761
01:01:10.623 --> 01:01:12.364
or anywhere in between.

762
01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:17.021
What is it then?

763
01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:18.370
It'’s just a hospital.

764
01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:24.985
But some have been here
a lot longer than others. They just don'’t want to leave.

765
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.818
I'’m not one of those people.

766
01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:33.602
That'’s good to hear. Sam.

767
01:01:34.865 --> 01:01:36.649
You chose
to get out of your bed.

768
01:01:36.823 --> 01:01:39.391
You chose to leave this--
this floor.

769
01:01:40.566 --> 01:01:42.699
What else are you
gonna choose to do next?

770
01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:47.616
I just want to get
out of this place.

771
01:01:56.103 --> 01:01:57.888
- No.
- What?

772
01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:04.721
I'’m going home.

773
01:02:17.559 --> 01:02:19.083
We'’re in the same place.

774
01:02:21.433 --> 01:02:22.739
Fuck!

775
01:02:24.653 --> 01:02:28.135
Well. at least
the orderly'’s gone.

776
01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:34.359
I really need
to talk to my wife.

777
01:02:34.533 --> 01:02:37.666
Now. there'’s an elevator
on each side of this hospital.

778
01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:40.757
but if we want to get
to the roof. we need to get to the other one.

779
01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:43.629
Right.

780
01:02:49.635 --> 01:02:51.724
Let'’s get the fuck out of here.

781
01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:04.606
Do you hear that?

782
01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.434
Yes. I do.

783
01:03:50.652 --> 01:03:51.828
Sarah?

784
01:03:57.094 --> 01:03:58.530
It'’s a girl.

785
01:04:02.664 --> 01:04:04.318
She'’s perfect.

786
01:04:06.364 --> 01:04:07.844
How'’s your head?

787
01:04:12.587 --> 01:04:13.893
It'’s okay.

788
01:04:15.416 --> 01:04:18.550
I'’ve been trying to get to you
from the moment I woke up.

789
01:04:19.507 --> 01:04:20.857
I'’ve never left.

790
01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:25.165
Remember. deep breaths.
Stay the course.

791
01:04:27.037 --> 01:04:29.082
How do I get out of here?

792
01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.870
Follow the signs.
Or use your GPS.

793
01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:36.089
Doesn'’t work in here.

794
01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:44.706
Then go to where it does.

795
01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:50.756
Sarah?

796
01:04:54.238 --> 01:04:56.675
Why are you
in this hospital. Virgil?

797
01:04:57.371 --> 01:04:59.417
I'’m old.

798
01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:01.419
Why are you?

799
01:05:04.857 --> 01:05:05.902
Car crash.

800
01:05:17.609 --> 01:05:20.220
I'’m dead. aren'’t I?

801
01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.963
I assure you.
you are not.

802
01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.531
Neither is anyone else here.

803
01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:29.229
at least not when
you first saw them.

804
01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:33.059
But being alive
is not the same as living.

805
01:05:33.886 --> 01:05:36.062
But if I die in here.

806
01:05:36.236 --> 01:05:37.716
then I really die?

807
01:05:45.419 --> 01:05:46.855
Quite the opposite.

808
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:49.815
If you die here.
you become even more disoriented

809
01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:52.426
as you lash out
at everyone and everything.

810
01:05:53.819 --> 01:05:56.909
And. therefore.
you'’re stuck here even longer.

811
01:06:07.746 --> 01:06:10.096
Who are you. Virgil?

812
01:06:12.925 --> 01:06:16.537
I'’m just a guide trying to
get you where you want to be.

813
01:06:17.582 --> 01:06:19.062
And Dr. Lily?

814
01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:22.500
She'’s a guide too.

815
01:06:22.674 --> 01:06:25.807
albeit one
with a different purpose.

816
01:06:32.684 --> 01:06:34.903
Hey. Hey.

817
01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:36.905
I'’m gonna get you out of here.

818
01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:40.605
Let'’s try
to get you out of here.

819
01:06:40.779 --> 01:06:42.650
The other guy was drinking.

820
01:06:44.435 --> 01:06:45.827
Dead now.

821
01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:49.353
Don'’t listen to her.
Just look at me.

822
01:06:51.746 --> 01:06:53.009
Give me your hand.

823
01:06:56.534 --> 01:06:57.622
There you go.

824
01:07:02.844 --> 01:07:05.282
Anything
to look beautiful. right?

825
01:07:05.456 --> 01:07:07.414
You already look......beautiful.

826
01:07:07.588 --> 01:07:09.416
You hear that. Doc?

827
01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:11.418
He'’s gonna put you
out of business.

828
01:07:11.592 --> 01:07:14.291
Oh. I'’m going
to make you......even more beautiful.

829
01:07:14.465 --> 01:07:16.293
- Oh. you better.
- Are you ready?

830
01:07:16.467 --> 01:07:17.859
Mm-hmm.

831
01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:21.733
All right. Just relax
and look up into the light.

832
01:07:21.907 --> 01:07:23.952
He'’ll stop
flashing that in your face any moment now.

833
01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:26.738
The light is very annoying.

834
01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:29.436
That'’s a bit bright.

835
01:07:34.311 --> 01:07:37.792
Yeah. I know.
It'’s a bit of a stereotype. but I like '’em.

836
01:07:37.966 --> 01:07:40.056
Can I grab a coffee there.
as well?

837
01:07:53.504 --> 01:07:54.809
Hoodie.

838
01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:00.859
Don'’t move!

839
01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:03.079
Hands where I can see '’em!

840
01:08:03.253 --> 01:08:05.994
Put your hands behind your head.
Down on your knees.

841
01:08:06.169 --> 01:08:07.344
Not him.

842
01:08:08.432 --> 01:08:10.086
You got the wrong guy. man.

843
01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:26.667
He'’s getting away!

844
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.367
It'’s not him.

845
01:08:37.287 --> 01:08:38.331
Are you okay?

846
01:08:47.732 --> 01:08:49.255
Let'’s get to the roof.

847
01:09:08.666 --> 01:09:09.971
That'’s not good.

848
01:09:11.277 --> 01:09:12.670
But I think I can take her.

849
01:09:14.106 --> 01:09:17.327
An injured
little girl in a hospital?

850
01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:19.329
She'’s a lot more
than that and you know it.

851
01:09:19.503 --> 01:09:21.853
Yeah. she is.

852
01:09:22.027 --> 01:09:24.072
Maybe you should try
talking to her.

853
01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:27.032
You know. the last time
you suggested that. it didn'’t work out so well.

854
01:09:27.206 --> 01:09:30.731
The last time I said that.
you were listening to someone else.

855
01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:36.694
She'’s all that
stands in our way?

856
01:09:37.608 --> 01:09:38.957
Exactly.

857
01:09:40.872 --> 01:09:42.047
Good.

858
01:09:56.104 --> 01:09:57.410
Hey there.

859
01:09:59.238 --> 01:10:00.674
Help me.

860
01:10:00.848 --> 01:10:02.067
I want to.

861
01:10:02.241 --> 01:10:04.200
I don'’t like it here.

862
01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:05.766
Me neither.

863
01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.377
Are you lost?

864
01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:10.467
Yes. but I don'’t want to go
with the bad lady.

865
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:12.599
No.

866
01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:16.560
Sam is heading up to the roof
so we can call for help.

867
01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:21.782
Do you want to come with us?

868
01:10:23.697 --> 01:10:24.959
Come on.

869
01:10:27.353 --> 01:10:30.269
Well. I would suggest
the stairs. but...

870
01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:35.753
We'’re gonna take the elevator. okay?

871
01:10:38.364 --> 01:10:39.583
Good girl.

872
01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:57.269
Get her to the stairs. Now.

873
01:12:02.579 --> 01:12:05.233
Hey. baby.
Don'’t be scared.

874
01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:09.629
When I count to three.
I want you to run as fast as you can. okay?

875
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:12.893
One.

876
01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:14.591
two.

877
01:12:14.765 --> 01:12:16.114
three! Run!

878
01:12:18.116 --> 01:12:19.857
- Go with her.
- What about you?

879
01:12:44.316 --> 01:12:46.492
You should be in bed.

880
01:12:57.547 --> 01:12:58.548
I love you.

881
01:12:59.636 --> 01:13:00.941
Don'’t get lost.

882
01:13:09.515 --> 01:13:13.084
Comatose. Brain-dead.
Life support.

883
01:13:13.258 --> 01:13:16.130
There is no up or down.

884
01:13:16.304 --> 01:13:18.611
You must stay in bed.

885
01:13:24.138 --> 01:13:25.313
Code red.

886
01:13:33.365 --> 01:13:34.758
Clear.

887
01:13:52.558 --> 01:13:54.038
I'’m the coma man.

888
01:14:06.746 --> 01:14:09.532
You should be in bed.

889
01:14:09.706 --> 01:14:11.316
Let him go!

890
01:14:14.101 --> 01:14:18.541
Ah. I thought we might need
to fix a sink.

891
01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.458
Virgil.

892
01:14:25.417 --> 01:14:27.288
How long have I been here?

893
01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.856
Oh. well.
that'’s up to you.

894
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:31.989
The faceless ones
want you to stay.

895
01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:35.209
"Life at any cost."

896
01:14:36.994 --> 01:14:38.299
I have a choice?

897
01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:39.692
Always.

898
01:14:39.866 --> 01:14:41.999
Now make it.
and get out of here.

899
01:14:42.173 --> 01:14:44.480
What about you?

900
01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:47.961
Well. I still have
some more guiding to do.

901
01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.879
Carter?

902
01:14:53.053 --> 01:14:54.315
Among others.

903
01:14:55.665 --> 01:14:56.796
Good luck. Sam.

904
01:15:02.628 --> 01:15:04.021
Thank you. Virgil.

905
01:15:24.128 --> 01:15:25.651
Hey. mister.

906
01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.915
Please help me.

907
01:15:46.933 --> 01:15:48.152
Come with me.

908
01:15:48.326 --> 01:15:49.893
I can'’t do it.

909
01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:51.547
We can do this together.

910
01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:53.853
Come on.

911
01:16:00.643 --> 01:16:02.035
Go.

912
01:16:05.822 --> 01:16:07.998
Freedom from this place
is downstairs.

913
01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:09.652
I promise you.

914
01:16:10.304 --> 01:16:11.697
Lilith?

915
01:16:11.871 --> 01:16:15.962
Your wife. your work.
your future child

916
01:16:16.876 --> 01:16:18.356
have been taken from you.

917
01:16:19.836 --> 01:16:23.317
That fear you feel.
rage against it.

918
01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:25.493
Rage with me.

919
01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:27.104
Let go.

920
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.888
Monica chose it.

921
01:16:43.337 --> 01:16:44.730
The cop chose it.

922
01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:02.530
And now you will choose it.

923
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.447
I choose the roof.

924
01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.145
You shouldn'’t be with her!

925
01:17:32.386 --> 01:17:35.781
Come on.

926
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.357
Come on. Let'’s go.

927
01:17:48.489 --> 01:17:49.534
Thank you.

928
01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:18.694
Let'’s go.

929
01:18:42.892 --> 01:18:44.720
We'’re going to be okay. baby.

930
01:18:49.202 --> 01:18:50.726
I love you.
