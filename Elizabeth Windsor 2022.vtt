A couple going off into exile...

1228
01:22:52.588 --> 01:22:56.592
and it's this curious echo
of her early years.

1229
01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.288
It's an unresolved issue.

1230
01:23:03.323 --> 01:23:05.014
She moves ahead.

1233
01:23:08.811 --> 01:23:12.711
it's something that sours
these later years of her reign.

whose laughter and ideas

1249
01:24:38.901 --> 01:24:41.593
and companionship
has always kept her going.

1250
01:25:08.517 --> 01:25:10.519

Without her mother

[CANNON FIRES]

1259
01:25:51.284 --> 01:25:53.631
Let me begin
by saying thank you

1260
01:25:54.218 --> 01:25:56.392
to all the thousands
of kind people

1261
01:25:56.703 --> 01:25:58.843
who have sent me
messages of goodwill.

1262
01:26:06.437 --> 01:26:07.610
At such a time

1263
01:26:07.955 --> 01:26:09.888
it is a great help to know

1264
01:26:10.234 --> 01:26:12.167
that there are multitudes
of friends

1267
01:26:15.618 --> 01:26:16.688
and who wish me well.

1268
01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:23.074
There is a motto

1269
01:26:23.108 --> 01:26:25.421
which has been borne
by many of my ancestors.

1270
01:26:26.353 --> 01:26:27.423
A noble motto.

1271
01:26:27.906 --> 01:26:28.873
"I serve."

[CROWD CHEERS]

1273
01:26:40.574 --> 01:26:42.680
I declare before you all
