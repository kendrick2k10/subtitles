00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:30.498
<i> Disneyland was</i>

4
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.667
<i>not like anywhere</i>
<i>else on Earth.</i>

5
00:00:34.408 --> 00:00:36.902
<i>My parents would save</i>
<i>all year long.</i>

6
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:39.608
<i>and we had one yearly trip</i>
<i>to the park.</i>

7
00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:42.379
<i>You had to have</i>

8
00:00:42.648 --> 00:00:43.876
<i>the Peter Pan hat</i>
<i>with the feather.</i>

9
00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:47.248
<i>We would go in and we'd.</i>
<i>you know.</i>

10
00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:48.551
<i>have our little bit of money.</i>

11
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:50.288
<i>I mean. it was magic</i>

12
00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:52.159
<i>from the minute</i>
<i>you got onto the tram.</i>

13
00:00:57.295 --> 00:00:59.298
<i>It was just... happy.</i>

14
00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.104
<i>When I started</i>
<i>working at the park.</i>

15
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.209
<i>the employees</i>
<i>were so happy to be there.</i>

16
00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:14.244
<i>You were proud</i>

17
00:01:14.746 --> 00:01:18.251
<i>to be a part</i>
<i>of this magnificent place.</i>

18
00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:21.617
<i>And they were proud of you.</i>

19
00:01:31.898 --> 00:01:33.056
That's year one.

20
00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:34.891
Everybody's always thrilled
to get that.

21
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.929
That's Steamboat Willie.

22
00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:39.737
Vanna White it.

23
00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.773
The second one is five years.

24
00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.940
Ten years...

25
00:01:48.914 --> 00:01:50.217
to 20.

26
00:01:51.587 --> 00:01:52.813
And...

27
00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:54.716
40.

28
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.888
Financially. you know.
they're not worth anything.

29
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.156
they're just...

30
00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:01.894
little pieces of pot metal.

31
00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:04.858
But when you've earned them.
when you've worked hard

32
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.663
and you've given
all those years to a company.

33
00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:10.336
to be recognized with that.
it really means a lot.

34
00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:14.441
And...

35
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.541
it means that the company
appreciated you.

36
00:02:19.112 --> 00:02:20.379
Or at least it did.

37
00:02:57.317 --> 00:02:58.549
<i> Growing up.</i>

38
00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:00.620
<i>Disneyland was</i>
<i>like a home away from home</i>

39
00:03:00.856 --> 00:03:02.080
<i>for my family.</i>

40
00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:07.019
<i>That's me</i>
<i>and my brand-new red coat.</i>

41
00:03:12.664 --> 00:03:14.433
<i>We called</i>
<i>Disneyland "the park."</i>

42
00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:17.530
<i>We went to the park</i>
<i>all the time</i>

43
00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.101
<i>to see my grandpa. Roy Disney.</i>

44
00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:22.634
<i>who. along with his brother.</i>
<i>started the Walt Disney Company</i>

45
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.044
<i>almost a century ago.</i>

46
00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:28.376
<i>They were kind of like</i>
<i>Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket.</i>

47
00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:30.747
<i>sort of id and superego.</i>

48
00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:33.216
<i>Walt would go off</i>
<i>and do some crazy thing.</i>

49
00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:34.915
<i>and then Roy would figure out</i>

50
00:03:35.117 --> 00:03:37.016
<i>where the money</i>
<i>was gonna come from.</i>

51
00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:43.056
<i>I'm really proud</i>

52
00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:45.293
<i>of what my grandfather</i>
<i>and great-uncle did.</i>

53
00:03:46.062 --> 00:03:49.402
<i>They brought so much joy</i>
<i>into the world.</i>

54
00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:54.273
<i>I was raised on their story.</i>

55
00:03:54.442 --> 00:03:56.943
<i>It was a story</i>
<i>about bootstraps.</i>

56
00:03:57.112 --> 00:03:58.835
<i>about rags to riches.</i>

57
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:00.847
<i>about the American Dream.</i>

58
00:04:01.216 --> 00:04:02.613
<i> It's said that...</i>

59
00:04:02.782 --> 00:04:04.177
<i>Somebody told me</i>
<i>and I heard one time</i>

60
00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:06.344
<i>that you could make one dollar</i>
<i>a day for a long time.</i>

61
00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.551
<i>and you support the family</i>
<i>on a dollar a day.</i>

62
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.055
<i>What's a dollar a day?</i>

63
00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:11.787
<i>Seven dollars a week.</i>

64
00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.097
<i> By mid-century.</i>
<i>their enterprise would help</i>

65
00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:21.066
<i>create the largest middleclass</i>

66
00:04:21.268 --> 00:04:22.963
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

67
00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:29.036
<i>Only later would I come to see</i>

68
00:04:29.238 --> 00:04:30.971
<i>that there was so much more</i>
<i>to the story.</i>

69
00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:43.919
<i>When you're a little kid.</i>
<i>you can't really understand</i>

70
00:04:44.122 --> 00:04:46.419
<i>that you're growing up</i>
<i>in something at all unusual</i>

71
00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:48.021
<i>or unfair.</i>

72
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.864
<i>The only metaphor</i>
<i>I can think of</i>

73
00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:52.430
<i>is if you're a goldfish.</i>

74
00:04:52.799 --> 00:04:54.896
<i>you don't really know</i>
<i>how to describe water.</i>

75
00:04:56.435 --> 00:04:58.572
<i>But then one day. you realize</i>

76
00:04:58.774 --> 00:05:01.639
<i>your family is a very big</i>
<i>and complicated deal.</i>

77
00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:04.870
<i>And you get trained</i>
<i>from childhood</i>

78
00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.512
<i>not to speak badly</i>
<i>ever in public</i>

79
00:05:07.714 --> 00:05:10.109
<i>about the family</i>
<i>or the business.</i>

80
00:05:11.514 --> 00:05:12.782
<i>And I didn't.</i>

81
00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:15.213
<i>For a long time.</i>

82
00:05:33.908 --> 00:05:35.541
<i> We're delighted</i>
<i>to welcome producer.</i>

83
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.042
<i>philanthropist.</i>
<i>and social activist.</i>

84
00:05:38.244 --> 00:05:39.512
<i>Abigail Disney.</i>

85
00:05:41.048 --> 00:05:45.679
<i>You compare the dynamics</i>
<i>of wealth to that of addiction.</i>

86
00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:47.545
<i> I'm sorry.</i>
<i>this is radical.</i>

87
00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.087
<i>too much money.</i>

88
00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:50.547
<i>There is such a thing.</i>

89
00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:52.284
<i>If you have a billion dollars</i>

90
00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.826
<i>and you wanna send your kid</i>
<i>to school. congratulations.</i>

91
00:05:54.962 --> 00:05:57.887
<i>you can send them to school</i>
<i>for 20.000 years.</i>

92
00:05:58.757 --> 00:06:01.298
<i> Abigail. why do you</i>
<i>wanna pay more taxes?</i>

93
00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:03.426
<i>We do not have a society</i>

94
00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:05.130
<i>structured around fairness</i>
<i>right now.</i>

95
00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:06.968
<i>and the proof is</i>
<i>in the pudding.</i>

96
00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.969
<i> Having</i>
<i>the last name "Disney"</i>

97
00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:12.045
<i>is like having</i>
<i>a weird superpower</i>

98
00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:13.337
<i>you didn't ask for.</i>

99
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.075
<i>For years.</i>

100
00:06:16.244 --> 00:06:17.748
<i>I've tried to do my best</i>
<i>with it.</i>

101
00:06:18.846 --> 00:06:20.382
<i>But I have to confess.</i>

102
00:06:20.684 --> 00:06:22.181
<i>even though I knew things were</i>

103
00:06:22.383 --> 00:06:24.090
<i>far from perfect</i>
<i>at the family business.</i>

104
00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.890
<i>it's always felt so impossible</i>
<i>to speak out</i>

105
00:06:28.092 --> 00:06:30.893
<i>because of the inevitable</i>
<i>repercussions.</i>

106
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.534
<i>My dad went to battle</i>

107
00:06:34.736 --> 00:06:36.796
<i>over the direction</i>
<i>of the company twice.</i>

108
00:06:37.532 --> 00:06:40.801
<i>And I saw the way he got</i>
<i>threatened with lawsuits</i>

109
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.076
<i>and torn to shreds</i>
<i>in the media.</i>

110
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.374
<i>Anybody would think twice</i>
<i>about getting involved.</i>

111
00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:01.526
<i>But then. one day.</i>
<i>out of the blue.</i>

112
00:07:01.828 --> 00:07:03.954
<i>I got a message</i>
<i>from a guy named Ralph.</i>

113
00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.932
<i>who worked at Disneyland.</i>

114
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.798
<i>He told me that he</i>
<i>and his fellow cast members.</i>

115
00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:14.305
<i>as Disney calls them.</i>

116
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:16.105
<i>were fighting for better pay.</i>

117
00:07:16.774 --> 00:07:18.578
<i>and he asked me for my help.</i>

118
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:24.040
<i>Even though</i>
<i>I have no role at the company.</i>

119
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.850
<i>I felt like I had</i>
<i>to go to Anaheim.</i>

120
00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:34.521
Oh. oh. there she goes.

121
00:07:34.689 --> 00:07:36.024
Go play!

122
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:41.161
Ready... set...

123
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.228
Go!

124
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.536
- No. I didn't say "Go!"

125
00:07:45.738 --> 00:07:47.034
- I won!
- You cheat!

126
00:07:47.236 --> 00:07:49.867
- Opal. come on over!

127
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.439
- Are you having fun yet?
- Come on!

128
00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:54.047
Turn around. turn around.

129
00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:55.543
Oh. here we go.

130
00:07:55.745 --> 00:07:57.209
You two can race.

131
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:58.843
Somebody's a princess.
you told me.

132
00:07:58.979 --> 00:07:59.880
Who's the princess?

133
00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:01.179
They're
all three princesses.

134
00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:02.484
They're all...
Oh. okay.

135
00:08:02.653 --> 00:08:03.921
We... we have...

136
00:08:04.224 --> 00:08:07.317
MacKallien is the one that is
the princess of all the lands.

137
00:08:07.452 --> 00:08:09.022
MacKayla.
our six-year-old.

138
00:08:09.158 --> 00:08:10.990
she is the
princess of the sky...

139
00:08:11.159 --> 00:08:12.499
- The sky!
- The sky!

140
00:08:12.668 --> 00:08:14.061
And then MacKallien.
our youngest...

141
00:08:14.197 --> 00:08:15.369
I'm the mermaid princess!

142
00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:16.670
She's the mermaid princess.

143
00:08:16.872 --> 00:08:18.328
And she's the
princess of all the seas. yes.

144
00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:19.665
You've divided it up
nicely.

145
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.704
Yes.

146
00:08:21.006 --> 00:08:22.873
You guys met at Disney?
You met each other?

147
00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:24.875
Yes. he saw me
in the parking lot.

148
00:08:25.044 --> 00:08:26.878
and I said. "Do you wanna
eat inside the park

149
00:08:27.047 --> 00:08:28.909
or outside the park?"
He said. "Inside the park."

150
00:08:29.112 --> 00:08:30.816
And we've been together
ever since.

151
00:08:30.984 --> 00:08:32.715
So. it was
an inside-the-park home run.

152
00:08:32.918 --> 00:08:34.615
- Pretty much.
- Pretty much.

153
00:08:34.817 --> 00:08:35.952
Go. Kenzie.

154
00:08:36.154 --> 00:08:37.584
Do you see your daughter?

155
00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:38.755
Go.

156
00:08:39.157 --> 00:08:41.023
<i> At the time</i>
<i>when we first met.</i>

157
00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.795
<i>I had this idea</i>

158
00:08:44.497 --> 00:08:46.466
<i>that we would move out</i>

159
00:08:46.702 --> 00:08:48.096
<i>and have our family</i>
<i>and everything.</i>

160
00:08:51.162 --> 00:08:52.765
Yay. Trin!

161
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.130
That's the way to do it!

162
00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.170
- Get 'im!

163
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.880
<i> Unfortunately.</i>
<i>the economy does not...</i>

164
00:09:01.216 --> 00:09:02.781
<i>allow that.</i>

165
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.542
We live with my mother-in-law.

166
00:09:06.488 --> 00:09:07.853
We're lucky enough to do that.

167
00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:14.622
<i> I've always wanted</i>
<i>to have a house of my own.</i>

168
00:09:14.824 --> 00:09:16.355
<i>always dreamed of one.</i>

169
00:09:17.658 --> 00:09:19.699
<i>But I would settle even</i>
<i>to have an apartment.</i>

170
00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:27.530
<i>It would be nice</i>
<i>to just have it where I can...</i>

171
00:09:27.832 --> 00:09:30.572
<i>show my kids</i>
<i>that I can do things on my own.</i>

172
00:09:31.175 --> 00:09:32.976
<i>and not have to</i>
<i>rely on my parents.</i>

173
00:09:33.112 --> 00:09:34.671
You want Mommy
to come down with you?

174
00:09:34.973 --> 00:09:36.309
Mm-hm.

175
00:09:39.152 --> 00:09:41.144
<i> Even with both of us</i>
<i>working full-time.</i>

176
00:09:41.613 --> 00:09:43.514
we still fall
below poverty level.

177
00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:48.993
<i> We try to do</i>
<i>as much as we can</i>

178
00:09:49.128 --> 00:09:51.164
<i>that doesn't require</i>
<i>any kind of money.</i>

179
00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:52.832
Trick or treat!

180
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.097
<i> We make</i>
<i>15 dollars an hour.</i>

181
00:09:56.166 --> 00:09:58.296
<i>And for people</i>
<i>who work at night.</i>

182
00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:01.171
we only get 75 cents
an hour extra.

183
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:04.672
But for working the hours
we work.

184
00:10:04.841 --> 00:10:06.904
with the lack of sleep.

185
00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:09.815
I don't think 75 cents
is enough.

186
00:10:13.218 --> 00:10:14.687
<i> Third shift</i>
<i>starts at 11:30</i>

187
00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:17.086
<i>to about eight o'clock</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

188
00:10:17.888 --> 00:10:19.286
<i>It's very physical work.</i>

189
00:10:20.556 --> 00:10:23.488
<i>We're the people</i>
<i>who do the pixie dust at night.</i>

190
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:27.525
<i>You scrub the kitchens.</i>
<i>the floor. the toilets.</i>

191
00:10:29.236 --> 00:10:31.870
<i>And I'm proud of what I do.</i>
<i>I'm very proud of it.</i>

192
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.497
<i>And that type of thing</i>

193
00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:36.842
<i>you'll find throughout</i>
<i>all the parks.</i>

194
00:10:38.703 --> 00:10:40.505
<i>The people</i>
<i>who tend to work there</i>

195
00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:43.376
want to provide the best.

196
00:10:50.723 --> 00:10:52.856
I go into work every day

197
00:10:53.158 --> 00:10:55.725
because this is a place
where magic is made.

198
00:10:55.894 --> 00:10:57.155
- you know?
- Uh-huh.

199
00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:01.261
We don't want those memories
of the first time

200
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.900
we were at Disney
when we were ten years old.

201
00:11:04.169 --> 00:11:06.838
and the walking down Main Street
and it feeling

202
00:11:07.007 --> 00:11:10.368
just so...
such incredible joy and magic...

203
00:11:10.537 --> 00:11:13.876
You don't want that
to not exist.

204
00:11:14.178 --> 00:11:16.882
For the first time
in over 60 years.

205
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:20.052
the union started talking
and we all found out

206
00:11:20.188 --> 00:11:22.583
that we were all struggling
with basically the same issues.

207
00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:23.688
Right.

208
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:25.885
None of us were
ever supposed to talk about

209
00:11:26.054 --> 00:11:27.491
how much money we made.

210
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.889
I worked two jobs
for eight years

211
00:11:30.057 --> 00:11:31.357
to make ends meet.

212
00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:35.262
Yeah. like. I. myself.
am actually a student.

213
00:11:35.564 --> 00:11:38.937
It's really expensive.
I wanna be a teacher but. um...

214
00:11:39.406 --> 00:11:40.538
I have two jobs.

215
00:11:40.707 --> 00:11:41.872
I don't just work at Disney.

216
00:11:42.008 --> 00:11:43.433
I also work
at Knott's Berry Farm.

217
00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:45.540
- Oh!

218
00:11:47.377 --> 00:11:50.039
I work for the mouse
and the dog.

219
00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:54.387
Disney is an industry leader
in terms of.

220
00:11:54.589 --> 00:11:56.714
like. theme parks. right?

221
00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:59.989
And the same things
that are happening at Disney

222
00:12:00.258 --> 00:12:02.424
are also happening
at Knott's Berry Farm.

223
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:06.092
We've had cast members
that have to make a decision

224
00:12:06.227 --> 00:12:08.961
between medication or food.

225
00:12:09.264 --> 00:12:10.627
And these are essential things

226
00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:12.663
that you can't make choices
like that.

227
00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.534
By a show of hands.

228
00:12:14.869 --> 00:12:18.277
how many of you have someone
you know that works at Disney

229
00:12:18.579 --> 00:12:20.044
that's on food stamps?

230
00:12:21.183 --> 00:12:22.210
Wow.

231
00:12:22.546 --> 00:12:24.445
How many of you know somebody
who works at Disney

232
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.145
who's slept in their car
in the last couple of years?

233
00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:29.413
How many of you know somebody

234
00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:31.456
who have gone
without medical care

235
00:12:31.592 --> 00:12:32.950
because can't afford it?

236
00:12:34.527 --> 00:12:35.395
I do!

237
00:12:35.564 --> 00:12:36.895
I know!

238
00:12:37.064 --> 00:12:38.832
How many of y'all
have children?

239
00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:44.327
I am somebody
who doesn't have kids.

240
00:12:44.496 --> 00:12:46.873
I don't have the finances

241
00:12:47.075 --> 00:12:50.006
to take care of a child
in the way that I would like to.

242
00:12:50.175 --> 00:12:53.474
It's affected my ability
to family plan

243
00:12:53.776 --> 00:12:56.612
and to look towards my future
as far as my personal life.

244
00:12:57.014 --> 00:12:59.379
And it's not... you know.

245
00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:02.119
this is not where I thought
I'd be at 33.

246
00:13:02.986 --> 00:13:05.016
Aw. don't cry.

247
00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:06.526
Aww.

248
00:13:06.695 --> 00:13:08.491
You can borrow our kids.

249
00:13:13.933 --> 00:13:15.266
<i> Everybody thinks</i>

250
00:13:15.435 --> 00:13:17.600
<i>that we can all just</i>
<i>bootstrap it and move up.</i>

251
00:13:22.938 --> 00:13:26.007
<i>If you're doing that job</i>
<i>to the best of your ability.</i>

252
00:13:26.576 --> 00:13:28.948
<i>it should be treated</i>
<i>like a proper job.</i>

253
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:34.178
<i>I think I should be able</i>
<i>to pay my bills</i>

254
00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:36.780
<i>on my custodial job.</i>

255
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.322
<i>But. you know.</i>

256
00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:41.785
<i>I've always had</i>
<i>somewhat unstable housing.</i>

257
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:46.427
<i>I ended up living in my van</i>
<i>for a few months.</i>

258
00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:51.196
<i>Right now. I'm renting a room</i>
<i>from a friend.</i>

259
00:13:51.365 --> 00:13:53.273
<i>but she's planning to retire.</i>

260
00:13:53.508 --> 00:13:54.998
<i>so I don't know</i>

261
00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:57.707
<i>what my housing situation's</i>
<i>gonna look like.</i>

262
00:13:58.042 --> 00:14:00.209
I look at the housing nearby

263
00:14:00.378 --> 00:14:03.109
and it's very much
out of my price range.

264
00:14:03.312 --> 00:14:05.446
A studio apartment would take.

265
00:14:05.581 --> 00:14:08.512
like. 80 percent
of my take-home pay a month.

266
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.614
and. like.
a one-bedroom apartment

267
00:14:10.817 --> 00:14:12.789
would be more than I make
in a month.

268
00:14:12.991 --> 00:14:14.452
I am not finding anything

269
00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:16.661
in the Anaheim/
Orange County area

270
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.530
that's in my price range.

271
00:14:34.012 --> 00:14:35.541
All right!

272
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.614
<i>I don't want anybody</i>

273
00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:39.346
<i>to have to deal with</i>

274
00:14:39.549 --> 00:14:41.448
<i>the same stress</i>
<i>that I deal with.</i>

275
00:14:41.684 --> 00:14:44.190
<i>and I know</i>
<i>everybody around me does.</i>

276
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.588
<i>That's why I started getting</i>
<i>more involved with the union.</i>

277
00:14:49.457 --> 00:14:51.254
<i>My co-workers are my family.</i>

278
00:14:53.433 --> 00:14:55.098
So. I don't know about you.

279
00:14:55.367 --> 00:14:57.162
brothers and sisters.
but I'm ready to fight!

280
00:14:57.364 --> 00:14:58.800
Are you ready to fight?!

281
00:14:58.968 --> 00:15:00.399
Yeah!

282
00:15:00.701 --> 00:15:03.306
Show them
what democracy looks like!

283
00:15:03.474 --> 00:15:05.478
This is what democracy
looks like!

284
00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:06.643
No justice!

285
00:15:06.811 --> 00:15:07.974
No peace!

286
00:15:08.142 --> 00:15:09.140
No justice!

287
00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:10.640
No peace!

288
00:15:10.808 --> 00:15:13.250
<i> I am 26 years old.</i>

289
00:15:14.553 --> 00:15:17.287
<i>I do school part-time</i>
<i>and I do work part-time.</i>

290
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.720
<i>For the longest time.</i>
<i>I did feel...</i>

291
00:15:21.922 --> 00:15:25.262
kind of like a failure.
to be quite honest.

292
00:15:27.867 --> 00:15:29.630
<i>I thought that by now.</i>

293
00:15:29.765 --> 00:15:33.797
<i>I would've moved out</i>
<i>from my parents' house.</i>

294
00:15:34.132 --> 00:15:37.175
<i>but now. it's just...</i>
<i>it's a little more</i>

295
00:15:37.544 --> 00:15:42.505
like...anger. because
I realize it's not just me.

296
00:15:42.707 --> 00:15:45.317
it's. like. so many of us.

297
00:15:52.024 --> 00:15:53.622
<i> In 2018.</i>

298
00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:56.321
<i>all the unions of Disneyland</i>
<i>organized a campaign</i>

299
00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.295
<i>to do battle with the company</i>

300
00:15:58.464 --> 00:16:00.330
<i>over their wages</i>
<i>and working conditions.</i>

301
00:16:02.636 --> 00:16:05.005
<i>Disney was under an enormous</i>
<i>amount of public pressure.</i>

302
00:16:05.807 --> 00:16:07.798
<i>and so. they reluctantly agreed</i>

303
00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:11.176
<i>to adopt a 15-dollar</i>
<i>minimum wage.</i>

304
00:16:12.143 --> 00:16:13.877
<i>But most experts say</i>

305
00:16:14.013 --> 00:16:16.576
<i>that a living wage in Anaheim</i>

306
00:16:16.778 --> 00:16:19.514
<i>is closer to 24</i>
<i>dollars an hour.</i>

307
00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:25.555
And so. the unions felt
that they were being. um...

308
00:16:25.991 --> 00:16:27.152
can I say "screwed?"

309
00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:28.889
- Yeah.
- Okay.

310
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.856
And so. the unions
and the employees at Disneyland

311
00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:36.828
asked me and my colleague
to do a survey.

312
00:16:38.503 --> 00:16:40.568
<i>We were shocked</i>
<i>by what we found.</i>

313
00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.576
<i>One out of every</i>
<i>10 full-time workers</i>

314
00:16:44.778 --> 00:16:46.376
<i>was homeless</i>

315
00:16:46.512 --> 00:16:48.815
<i>at some point</i>
<i>in the previous two years.</i>

316
00:16:49.518 --> 00:16:52.943
<i>And two-thirds didn't have</i>
<i>enough money to pay for food.</i>

317
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:56.853
<i>At the same time. in 2018.</i>

318
00:16:57.022 --> 00:16:59.219
<i>Disney's CEO Bob Iger.</i>

319
00:16:59.388 --> 00:17:02.722
<i>made $65 million in one year.</i>

320
00:17:04.155 --> 00:17:07.595
<i> Iger's package</i>
<i>was 1.424 times</i>

321
00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:10.197
<i>the median salary</i>
<i>of a Disney employee.</i>

322
00:17:10.433 --> 00:17:12.934
<i> That's 2.000 times</i>

323
00:17:13.337 --> 00:17:14.901
<i>the salary of a custodian.</i>

324
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.473
<i>In other words.</i>

325
00:17:16.675 --> 00:17:20.113
<i>a custodian would have to work</i>
<i>for 2.000 years</i>

326
00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:23.039
<i>to make what Bob Iger makes</i>
<i>in one.</i>

327
00:17:24.649 --> 00:17:27.681
<i> The Disney Company</i>
<i>is ground zero</i>

328
00:17:27.883 --> 00:17:30.222
<i>of the widening inequality</i>
<i>in America.</i>

329
00:17:31.353 --> 00:17:33.051
<i>But there's a myth</i>

330
00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:36.053
<i>that Disney's prosperity</i>

331
00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:39.125
<i>will trickle down</i>
<i>to ordinary people.</i>

332
00:17:39.994 --> 00:17:42.232
<i>The city council</i>
<i>and the mayor of Anaheim</i>

333
00:17:42.701 --> 00:17:45.263
<i>have believed that</i>
<i>if Disneyland does well.</i>

334
00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:47.767
<i>then Anaheim does well.</i>

335
00:17:54.976 --> 00:17:57.040
<i>Anaheim's a tale of two cities.</i>

336
00:17:57.809 --> 00:17:59.680
<i>You have the resort district.</i>

337
00:18:00.647 --> 00:18:02.282
<i>This is where Disneyland's at.</i>

338
00:18:02.784 --> 00:18:04.190
<i>this is where</i>
<i>the stadium is at.</i>

339
00:18:07.792 --> 00:18:09.822
<i>Then. you get</i>
<i>the south part of the town.</i>

340
00:18:09.957 --> 00:18:12.164
you have many of
the working-class communities.

341
00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:13.925
When you go around
through the streets.

342
00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:16.626
you see infrastructure
that's not updated.

343
00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:19.139
you know. you see gang problems.

344
00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:25.774
When we first started covering
Anaheim for Voice of OC.

345
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.811
the big argument was that
all of the money in Anaheim

346
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.346
was spent

347
00:18:30.482 --> 00:18:32.078
on the northern part
of the town.

348
00:18:33.148 --> 00:18:35.649
The south part of the town
does not get the investment.

349
00:18:35.785 --> 00:18:37.949
The only investment it gets
is police.

350
00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:51.836
<i> One of the things.</i>
<i>for me.</i>

351
00:18:52.005 --> 00:18:53.201
<i>in being on Council is</i>

352
00:18:53.337 --> 00:18:54.999
<i>how quickly I learned about...</i>

353
00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.336
<i>the focus is so</i>
<i>much on tourism.</i>

354
00:18:56.472 --> 00:18:57.540
<i>and making sure that</i>

355
00:18:57.775 --> 00:18:58.971
<i>the children of the tourists</i>
<i>are happy.</i>

356
00:18:59.106 --> 00:19:00.446
- <i> Mm-hm.</i>
- <i> Right?</i>

357
00:19:00.649 --> 00:19:02.544
<i>In the happiest place on Earth.</i>
<i>and they forget about...</i>

358
00:19:02.713 --> 00:19:04.677
or don't even consider.
they're just indifferent

359
00:19:04.879 --> 00:19:06.015
to the lives
of the actual children

360
00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:07.583
who live in Anaheim.

361
00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:11.188
<i>We've seen a void in policies</i>

362
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.885
that really are centered
around people

363
00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:14.523
and the lives
that they lead here in Anaheim

364
00:19:14.725 --> 00:19:17.425
versus policies
that continue to give tax breaks

365
00:19:17.728 --> 00:19:20.729
and more money
to those who already have much.

366
00:19:28.677 --> 00:19:31.536
<i> So. tell us</i>
<i>the legend of the parking lot.</i>

367
00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:33.471
<i>'cause it's crazy to me.</i>

368
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.876
<i> Yeah. so in 1996.</i>

369
00:19:37.045 --> 00:19:39.714
<i>the city took on</i>
<i>a $500-million-bond.</i>

370
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:41.815
Part of that bond was

371
00:19:41.951 --> 00:19:44.521
to build a parking lot
for the Disney resort.

372
00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:51.324
<i>The city then leased it</i>
<i>to Disney</i>

373
00:19:51.526 --> 00:19:52.430
for a dollar a year.

374
00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:55.493
Disney would keep
all of the revenue.

375
00:19:55.629 --> 00:19:56.863
All of the revenue.

376
00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:01.238
<i>If they fill up</i>
<i>300 days a year.</i>

377
00:20:01.373 --> 00:20:04.804
<i>it's 10.000 cars. $25 a car.</i>

378
00:20:05.006 --> 00:20:07.379
<i>that's $65 million</i>
<i>in pure revenue.</i>

379
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.409
So. basically.
it's a business...

380
00:20:12.012 --> 00:20:14.279
that they spent
no capital creating.

381
00:20:14.515 --> 00:20:15.480
Correct.

382
00:20:15.749 --> 00:20:18.055
The corporation should not

383
00:20:18.224 --> 00:20:21.052
be looking to get public dollars

384
00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:24.292
to do its private business.
to grow its business.

385
00:20:24.461 --> 00:20:26.158
It's not a start-up company.

386
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.197
And even then. Walt Disney
didn't ask for public dollars

387
00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:30.633
when he was starting up.

388
00:20:33.272 --> 00:20:34.405
<i> And yet.</i>

389
00:20:34.674 --> 00:20:37.804
<i>in the two decades</i>
<i>leading up to 2018.</i>

390
00:20:38.073 --> 00:20:40.044
<i>Disney had gotten</i>
<i>the city of Anaheim</i>

391
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.206
<i>to cough up a billion dollars</i>

392
00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:44.912
<i>in the form of subsidies</i>
<i>and tax breaks.</i>

393
00:20:45.615 --> 00:20:46.748
<i> These deals</i>

394
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.219
<i>moved through</i>
<i>without a lot of opposition.</i>

395
00:20:49.354 --> 00:20:50.646
<i>without a lot of debate.</i>

396
00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:54.919
You know. there's dark money
of Disney influencing.

397
00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:57.660
through a series
of resort-related PACs.

398
00:20:57.862 --> 00:21:00.360
and controlling governance
of the city council.

399
00:21:00.963 --> 00:21:03.128
So. here's a story
from four years ago.

400
00:21:03.297 --> 00:21:05.163
"For another meeting
that went into the wee hours.

401
00:21:05.332 --> 00:21:08.000
the Anaheim City Council
narrowly approves a tax shield

402
00:21:08.169 --> 00:21:10.838
for Disneyland that effectively
strips residents

403
00:21:11.007 --> 00:21:13.505
of their power to tax admission
to the mega-resort

404
00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:15.380
for up to 45 years."

405
00:21:15.582 --> 00:21:17.883
So. they were
protected against a tax

406
00:21:18.085 --> 00:21:19.383
that didn't exist yet.

407
00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:21.018
They were protected
against the idea

408
00:21:21.187 --> 00:21:23.218
of a tax for 45 years.

409
00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.984
Yeah. exactly right.

410
00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:35.094
<i>Everything Disney was doing.</i>

411
00:21:35.262 --> 00:21:37.603
<i>from skirting taxes</i>
<i>to stiffing workers.</i>

412
00:21:37.772 --> 00:21:41.132
<i>was happening at almost</i>
<i>every big company in America.</i>

413
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.702
<i>I came home</i>
<i>to my privileged life</i>

414
00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:47.545
<i>feeling complicit.</i>

415
00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:50.215
<i>Everything I had</i>

416
00:21:50.684 --> 00:21:52.781
<i>came from</i>
<i>inheriting company shares.</i>

417
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.620
<i>I had no role</i>
<i>or influence at Disney.</i>

418
00:21:57.918 --> 00:21:59.656
<i>and no idea where to start</i>

419
00:21:59.824 --> 00:22:01.526
<i>if I wanted</i>
<i>to make a difference.</i>

420
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:06.658
<i>My father always told me.</i>

421
00:22:06.861 --> 00:22:08.593
<i>"First. you try quietly."</i>

422
00:22:08.962 --> 00:22:11.498
<i>I knew it would go nowhere.</i>

423
00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:13.097
<i>but I thought I owed Bob Iger</i>

424
00:22:13.299 --> 00:22:14.506
<i>at least the courtesy</i>
<i>of an email.</i>

425
00:22:15.309 --> 00:22:16.542
<i>So. that's where I started.</i>

426
00:22:16.978 --> 00:22:18.309
<i>"Dear Bob.</i>

427
00:22:18.712 --> 00:22:20.910
<i>there is a painful irony</i>
<i>in the idea</i>

428
00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:23.741
<i>that someone working</i>
<i>at the happiest place on Earth</i>

429
00:22:23.976 --> 00:22:26.018
<i>is sleeping in his car."</i>

430
00:22:26.654 --> 00:22:29.280
<i>"These issues</i>
<i>are real and painful.</i>

431
00:22:29.483 --> 00:22:32.187
<i>and don't represent</i>
<i>who Disney is as a company</i>

432
00:22:32.656 --> 00:22:34.654
<i>and who you are as a man."</i>

433
00:22:35.223 --> 00:22:37.328
<i>"What if Disney chose</i>
<i>to pay people well</i>

434
00:22:37.463 --> 00:22:39.355
<i>and give them job security?</i>

435
00:22:40.466 --> 00:22:42.402
<i>"What if you chose to lead?"</i>

436
00:22:44.731 --> 00:22:46.032
Send.

437
00:22:50.074 --> 00:22:52.537
Is there a way to. like.
sit with Bob and talk about it?

438
00:22:52.706 --> 00:22:53.609
Do you think?

439
00:22:54.044 --> 00:22:55.380
I don't think Bob's
gonna meet with you. honey.

440
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:57.274
Yeah.
I figured as well.

441
00:22:57.476 --> 00:22:58.943
- Even if I asked him.
- Yeah. yeah.

442
00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:00.682
- And he likes me.
- Yeah.

443
00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:02.245
No. he's not
gonna meet with you.

444
00:23:02.414 --> 00:23:04.015
I always knew him
to be a good guy but.

445
00:23:04.251 --> 00:23:06.888
um... but he just needs
to kinda wake up.

446
00:23:07.024 --> 00:23:08.560
- Yeah.
- Smell the roses. and yes.

447
00:23:08.695 --> 00:23:09.956
I'll probably
not stay friends with him

448
00:23:10.092 --> 00:23:11.595
if he ever hears me say that.

449
00:23:11.764 --> 00:23:14.757
My issue is not
that he's not a nice person.

450
00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:15.962
Right.

451
00:23:16.131 --> 00:23:19.801
My issue is that
nice isn't enough. you know?

452
00:23:20.103 --> 00:23:22.137
And you know. honestly.
it's not all Bob's fault.

453
00:23:22.372 --> 00:23:23.440
He's just doing

454
00:23:23.575 --> 00:23:24.937
what Wall Street
tells him to do.

455
00:23:25.106 --> 00:23:26.469
It's the culture
that's wrong.

456
00:23:26.637 --> 00:23:28.281
You know. and if tomorrow.
he went out and said.

457
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.306
"Give everybody
24 dollars an hour."

458
00:23:30.475 --> 00:23:32.276
the share price would plummet.
you know?

459
00:23:32.445 --> 00:23:34.111
He'd get punished for it.
he'd lose his job.

460
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.881
So. it's not exactly one CEO.
or...

461
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.222
This is a culture-wide thing.

462
00:23:38.391 --> 00:23:40.482
Well. Bob can rationalize it

463
00:23:40.684 --> 00:23:42.724
because he's brought so much
"value to the company."

464
00:23:42.893 --> 00:23:44.591
in the sense
of stockholder value...

465
00:23:44.726 --> 00:23:45.726
No question.

466
00:23:45.895 --> 00:23:47.227
...and we have benefited
from that.

467
00:23:47.363 --> 00:23:49.900
and they pay dividends out.
and we benefit from that.

468
00:23:50.069 --> 00:23:51.103
Yeah.

469
00:23:51.573 --> 00:23:53.666
But it's prioritizing
the wrong thing.

470
00:23:53.869 --> 00:23:55.765
It's not prioritizing people.

471
00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:56.970
Yeah.

472
00:23:57.139 --> 00:24:00.304
And it's... the core problem
right there.

473
00:24:02.247 --> 00:24:03.245
That's Grandpa.

474
00:24:03.414 --> 00:24:04.482
Yeah.

475
00:24:04.884 --> 00:24:07.151
You know. Grandma told me
I was his favorite.

476
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.947
Did you ever hear that?

477
00:24:09.116 --> 00:24:10.617
- That's just not true.

478
00:24:10.786 --> 00:24:11.886
There's no way that's true.

479
00:24:12.088 --> 00:24:14.122
'cause I thought
I was his favorite.

480
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.054
It's just hard for me
to imagine.

481
00:24:19.256 --> 00:24:20.790
And correct me if I'm wrong.

482
00:24:20.958 --> 00:24:22.233
but I cannot see

483
00:24:22.469 --> 00:24:24.831
him taking
$66 million home

484
00:24:25.133 --> 00:24:27.868
for a year's work
in the same year.

485
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.308
when. at the same company.
people can't afford food.

486
00:24:31.477 --> 00:24:32.707
I don't see that happening.

487
00:24:32.876 --> 00:24:34.212
That would never
have happened.

488
00:24:34.381 --> 00:24:35.878
That would never have happened.

489
00:24:36.046 --> 00:24:39.209
It was a different time.
Now. it's about money.

490
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:41.311
- Greed is good. Yeah.
- Greed is good.

491
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.516
I mean. Ayn Rand
was one of the people

492
00:24:43.752 --> 00:24:45.149
who kind of came up

493
00:24:45.285 --> 00:24:47.058
with the idea
that greed was good.

494
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.293
Mm-hm.

495
00:24:48.428 --> 00:24:51.062
And she was seen as a fruitcake!

496
00:24:51.264 --> 00:24:52.796
A nut! An outlier!

497
00:24:52.964 --> 00:24:54.899
Well. maybe that's how
they look at you. honey.

498
00:25:02.106 --> 00:25:03.700
<i> When Bob Iger</i>
<i>wrote back.</i>

499
00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:07.009
<i>he acknowledged the problems</i>
<i>his workers were having.</i>

500
00:25:07.545 --> 00:25:08.680
<i>But he suggested</i>

501
00:25:08.882 --> 00:25:10.715
<i>that the government</i>
<i>was failing them.</i>

502
00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:12.744
<i>and that simply</i>
<i>increasing their pay</i>

503
00:25:13.013 --> 00:25:14.612
<i>wouldn't solve their problems.</i>

504
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:17.252
<i>He referred me</i>
<i>to the head of HR.</i>

505
00:25:17.421 --> 00:25:20.553
<i>who told me about the company's</i>
<i>free education program...</i>

506
00:25:21.422 --> 00:25:24.696
<i>which is nice.</i>
<i>but it doesn't pay the rent.</i>

507
00:25:26.158 --> 00:25:27.699
<i>It was exasperating.</i>

508
00:25:32.404 --> 00:25:33.529
What's up?

509
00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:36.906
Iger put me in touch
with the head of HR there.

510
00:25:37.074 --> 00:25:39.704
and she was very nice
and very helpful. and...

511
00:25:40.307 --> 00:25:41.937
I don't know
if they don't understand

512
00:25:42.173 --> 00:25:43.348
what I'm getting at

513
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.842
or if they don't
wanna understand

514
00:25:45.011 --> 00:25:46.542
what I'm getting at...

515
00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:49.879
but it was clear
I wasn't getting anywhere.

516
00:25:50.748 --> 00:25:53.153
So. I don't know what direction
this is gonna go in.

517
00:25:54.156 --> 00:25:56.095
So. you...
you want higher taxes.

518
00:25:56.264 --> 00:25:57.286
I do. I do.

519
00:25:57.489 --> 00:25:58.726
I think that
at least the wealthy

520
00:25:58.861 --> 00:26:00.430
need to be paying higher taxes.

521
00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:01.667
And what does that mean to you.

522
00:26:01.802 --> 00:26:03.199
- when you say "higher taxes"?
- Well...

523
00:26:03.335 --> 00:26:05.563
<i> So. after months</i>
<i>of feeling paralyzed.</i>

524
00:26:05.732 --> 00:26:08.904
<i>there I was doing a live</i>
<i>segment about taxing the rich</i>

525
00:26:09.073 --> 00:26:11.435
<i>when I got</i>
<i>an unexpected question.</i>

526
00:26:11.637 --> 00:26:13.337
And then the other question
I was gonna ask you

527
00:26:13.473 --> 00:26:14.973
is there's a Disney shareholder
meeting today.

528
00:26:15.142 --> 00:26:16.308
- as it happens.
- Yes.

529
00:26:16.444 --> 00:26:18.011
Do you think
that Bob Iger's overpaid?

530
00:26:18.147 --> 00:26:19.650
- You know him.
- I think that CEOs.

531
00:26:19.786 --> 00:26:20.950
in general.
are paid far too much.

532
00:26:21.219 --> 00:26:22.786
I imagine you have
a lot of Disney stock. right?

533
00:26:22.921 --> 00:26:24.285
I'm not gonna come
out and say that.

534
00:26:24.421 --> 00:26:28.527
but I will say that if your
CEO's salary is at the 700.

535
00:26:28.729 --> 00:26:31.857
600. 500 times
your median worker's pay.

536
00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:33.693
then there is nobody on Earth...

537
00:26:33.829 --> 00:26:35.095
Jesus Christ himself

538
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.960
isn't worth 500 times
his median worker's pay.

539
00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:06.856
<i> Clearly.</i>
<i>I'd struck a nerve.</i>

540
00:27:14.537 --> 00:27:16.673
<i> She dove deeper</i>
<i>into her remarks Sunday</i>

541
00:27:16.808 --> 00:27:19.040
<i>in nearly two-dozen tweets.</i>

542
00:27:19.176 --> 00:27:20.972
<i>Abigail Disney wrote.</i>

543
00:27:21.141 --> 00:27:22.442
<i>"It's time to call out Disney</i>

544
00:27:22.578 --> 00:27:24.983
<i>and anyone else rich</i>
<i>off their workers' backs."</i>

545
00:27:26.187 --> 00:27:28.319
<i> Disney is testifying</i>
<i>before Congress today</i>

546
00:27:28.487 --> 00:27:29.846
<i>over CEO pay.</i>

547
00:27:30.816 --> 00:27:32.581
<i> This topic</i>
<i>of income inequality</i>

548
00:27:32.817 --> 00:27:34.859
<i>is really heating up</i>
<i>on Capitol Hill.</i>

549
00:27:40.297 --> 00:27:43.197
My mother's voice
is working overtime right now.

550
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:45.700
telling me to sit up straight

551
00:27:45.935 --> 00:27:47.905
and asking me who I think I am.

552
00:27:50.774 --> 00:27:51.975
It's sort of like. um.

553
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.978
"You need to feel awful
about what you're doing.

554
00:27:54.147 --> 00:27:56.044
but if you're gonna feel awful
about what you're doing.

555
00:27:56.213 --> 00:27:57.911
you should at least
sit up straight."

556
00:27:58.347 --> 00:28:00.181
- Okay. perfect.

557
00:28:02.684 --> 00:28:03.885
Okay.

558
00:28:04.121 --> 00:28:06.055
- I am so nervous.
- What?

559
00:28:06.224 --> 00:28:07.886
- I'm so nervous right now.
- I know. breathe.

560
00:28:08.489 --> 00:28:09.995
Did I ever
show you this ring?

561
00:28:10.798 --> 00:28:12.231
- Do you know what it is?
- No.

562
00:28:12.366 --> 00:28:13.364
Oh. it's bananas.

563
00:28:13.533 --> 00:28:14.556
- No?
- No.

564
00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:16.131
- What is it?
- It's a clitoris.

565
00:28:16.333 --> 00:28:18.197
- It's a clitoris.

566
00:28:18.366 --> 00:28:20.372
I gotta tell you.
when I wear this.

567
00:28:20.541 --> 00:28:21.935
it's always the men who say.

568
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.932
"Wow. that's a beautiful ring."

569
00:28:26.074 --> 00:28:27.369
That's deeply disturbing.

570
00:28:27.538 --> 00:28:29.740
And I just... I love it!

571
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:32.244
And so. I like to wear it
to the most patriarchal places.

572
00:28:32.413 --> 00:28:33.883
- And point it right at 'em.
- Yeah.

573
00:28:34.019 --> 00:28:35.115
Fight the power.

574
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.881
It did look like bananas
at first.

575
00:28:39.024 --> 00:28:40.225
- Thank you so much.

576
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.219
Okay.

577
00:28:41.755 --> 00:28:43.254
- Thank you.
- Here we go. girls.

578
00:28:43.723 --> 00:28:45.220
- All right.
- Let's do it.

579
00:28:45.389 --> 00:28:46.898
Let's do it.

580
00:28:54.105 --> 00:28:55.533
The Committee
will come to order.

581
00:28:55.768 --> 00:28:58.739
The hearing is entitled

582
00:28:58.908 --> 00:29:00.110
A Review of Proposals

583
00:29:00.278 --> 00:29:02.271
to Strengthen the Rights
and Protections of Workers."

584
00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.146
and I now recognize the...

585
00:29:04.348 --> 00:29:06.944
No. Madame Chair. I have
a parliamentarian inquiry.

586
00:29:07.113 --> 00:29:08.216
Okay.

587
00:29:08.385 --> 00:29:11.620
I'd like to know
the purpose of the filming.

588
00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:12.957
It's highly unusual.

589
00:29:13.126 --> 00:29:16.055
Is this a for-profit
or not-for-profit entity?

590
00:29:16.191 --> 00:29:17.787
It might be for profit entity.

591
00:29:17.956 --> 00:29:19.960
but I've certainly never seen
a profit on any of it

592
00:29:20.162 --> 00:29:21.328
- but um...

593
00:29:21.664 --> 00:29:23.302
Reclaiming my time.
I don't believe this is a...

594
00:29:23.437 --> 00:29:24.694
I don't believe...

595
00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:26.834
<i> The objections</i>
<i>to my having</i>

596
00:29:27.003 --> 00:29:28.332
<i>a film crew present</i>

597
00:29:28.568 --> 00:29:29.838
<i>came seemingly</i>
<i>out of the blue.</i>

598
00:29:30.007 --> 00:29:31.441
<i>though I would later learn</i>

599
00:29:31.576 --> 00:29:34.441
<i>that a Disney lobbyist had been</i>
<i>working behind the scenes</i>

600
00:29:34.644 --> 00:29:37.315
<i>pressuring both sides</i>
<i>to prevent me from speaking.</i>

601
00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:38.950
Move to adjourn.

602
00:29:40.516 --> 00:29:43.453
All those in favor
of the move to adjourn.

603
00:29:43.588 --> 00:29:44.982
say "Aye."

604
00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:46.215
Aye.

605
00:29:46.518 --> 00:29:48.856
All those opposed. say "Nay."

606
00:29:49.025 --> 00:29:50.522
Nay.

607
00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:53.756
In the opinion of the Chair.
the nays have it.

608
00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:57.532
Dr. Disney.
you are now recognized.

609
00:29:57.734 --> 00:29:58.763
Thank you.

610
00:29:59.733 --> 00:30:01.999
Today. I hope
to raise some simple questions

611
00:30:02.235 --> 00:30:04.099
about CEO compensation.

612
00:30:04.902 --> 00:30:07.504
Does a CEO's pay
have any relationship

613
00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.881
what his hotel maids
and janitors get?

614
00:30:11.083 --> 00:30:13.115
Do the people
who spend a lifetime

615
00:30:13.284 --> 00:30:15.687
at the lowest inch
of the wage spectrum

616
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.286
deserve the dignity
of a living wage?

617
00:30:18.922 --> 00:30:20.926
This is a moral issue.

618
00:30:22.556 --> 00:30:24.590
The burden
is not just on Disney.

619
00:30:24.792 --> 00:30:27.591
and Disney is a long way
from being the worst offender.

620
00:30:27.793 --> 00:30:30.067
Disney could tomorrow
raise the salaries

621
00:30:30.202 --> 00:30:31.899
of all of its workers
to a living wage.

622
00:30:32.068 --> 00:30:33.730
It was possible to do this

623
00:30:33.966 --> 00:30:36.408
when my great-uncle and
grandfather built the company.

624
00:30:36.543 --> 00:30:37.668
it's possible now.

625
00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:40.204
People made this problem.

626
00:30:40.373 --> 00:30:42.379
and by people. it can be fixed.

627
00:30:42.548 --> 00:30:43.707
Thank you.

628
00:30:50.751 --> 00:30:53.750
The gentleman
from Indiana is now recognized.

629
00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:57.194
Well. Dr. Disney.
I heard you several times say

630
00:30:57.362 --> 00:31:00.393
what CEO pay should be.
what living wage should be.

631
00:31:00.695 --> 00:31:03.902
up and down the spectrum.
sea to shining sea.

632
00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:06.229
That is...
We have a definition of that.

633
00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.572
That is socialism.

634
00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:08.664
Here we go with socialism.

635
00:31:08.833 --> 00:31:10.107
We know what that is.

636
00:31:10.309 --> 00:31:12.537
This idea
that a company exists solely

637
00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:15.446
to maximize profits.
that is simply not true.

638
00:31:16.315 --> 00:31:18.941
Companies have moral obligations
to their employees.

639
00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:20.783
If you don't wanna
call this "socialism."

640
00:31:20.985 --> 00:31:22.587
I suppose you can call it

641
00:31:22.756 --> 00:31:24.314
"Marxism." "neo-Marxism."

642
00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:26.883
It certainly isn't the path

643
00:31:27.019 --> 00:31:29.987
that made our country
the world's land of opportunity.

644
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.964
The reality is
the entire American workforce

645
00:31:34.233 --> 00:31:36.331
is benefiting
from this era of prosperity.

646
00:32:01.118 --> 00:32:02.886
Where do you want the...
uh. yellow onions?

647
00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:04.887
- Next to the reds?
- Right next to the red.

648
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.302
We got up at four o'clock
this morning.

649
00:32:14.104 --> 00:32:15.606
I haven't been feeling good.

650
00:32:15.775 --> 00:32:18.134
and Ralph was up for...

651
00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.111
over 24 hours.

652
00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.781
He worked the night before.
he got off work.

653
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:24.977
and he went over
to the food bank.

654
00:32:25.813 --> 00:32:28.449
Sometimes. we feel like
we miss our kids. whatnot.

655
00:32:29.646 --> 00:32:30.947
But at the same time.

656
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.823
we also want our kids to know

657
00:32:33.992 --> 00:32:37.227
exactly what it's like to give.

658
00:32:38.598 --> 00:32:39.524
Here. Ellie.

659
00:32:39.726 --> 00:32:40.999
We have one more
over there. too.

660
00:32:41.135 --> 00:32:42.358
I'm gonna hand you
the stuff over here.

661
00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:43.860
Okay. sounds good.

662
00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.300
Did you wash the apples?

663
00:32:46.469 --> 00:32:47.902
- Si.
- Thank you.

664
00:32:48.638 --> 00:32:50.465
Snow White.
I always wash the apples.

665
00:32:50.634 --> 00:32:52.077
No. you don't.

666
00:32:56.011 --> 00:32:58.648
<i> The Disney Company</i>

which is we are
reducing income inequality

688
00:34:00.745 --> 00:34:03.446
through free-market capitalism
and through the tax cuts.

689
00:34:03.648 --> 00:34:06.080
more investment by businesses.
a tight labor market.

690
00:34:06.249 --> 00:34:08.052
That's the best thing you can do

691
00:34:08.221 --> 00:34:09.754
for. you know.
working-class Americans.

692
00:34:09.923 --> 00:34:11.554
'cause we all want... look.

693
00:34:11.689 --> 00:34:13.356
we all want Americans
to climb the economic ladder.

694
00:34:21.696 --> 00:34:23.591
So. lemme ask you
about this. Okay.

695
00:34:23.727 --> 00:34:25.136
here I am. hacking away

696
00:34:25.338 --> 00:34:27.899
at trying to make a difference
at this company.

697
00:34:28.102 --> 00:34:30.907
partly because I think Disney's
like a bellwether company.

698
00:34:31.076 --> 00:34:33.011
Their power is so immense.

699
00:34:33.213 --> 00:34:35.139
but they're being stalled
by fear...

700
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:38.412
and conformity and... well.
and greed.

701
00:34:38.714 --> 00:34:40.349
I mean. am I wrong about that?
If they change.

702
00:34:40.551 --> 00:34:42.182
there will be those
that follow behind?

703
00:34:42.385 --> 00:34:43.816
No. you're gonna need Disney.

704
00:34:43.951 --> 00:34:45.520
but you're gonna need
one or two other companies

705
00:34:45.655 --> 00:34:47.289
of people running them
with a conscience.

706
00:34:47.558 --> 00:34:50.354
But you've gotta
get that first cog moved.

707
00:34:50.556 --> 00:34:52.030
Yeah. exactly.

708
00:34:52.233 --> 00:34:54.424
So. what's the strategy?
What am I missing?

709
00:34:54.593 --> 00:34:56.201
What do I need to do?

710
00:34:57.068 --> 00:34:58.436
Make a movie about it?

711
00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.836
There's that.

712
00:35:06.874 --> 00:35:08.504
<i>Well. that was meta.</i>

713
00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:11.476
<i>But I did grow up</i>
<i>steeped in the power</i>

714
00:35:11.611 --> 00:35:13.185
<i>of stories to change the world.</i>

715
00:35:14.549 --> 00:35:16.849
<i>My family is itself a story.</i>

716
00:35:18.052 --> 00:35:20.516
<i>One that's invoked constantly</i>
<i>as the embodiment</i>

717
00:35:20.718 --> 00:35:21.820
<i>of the American Dream.</i>

718
00:35:26.093 --> 00:35:28.299
<i>But an unexamined story</i>
<i>is a dangerous thing.</i>

719
00:35:29.299 --> 00:35:30.768
<i>That American story</i>

720
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.633
<i>about rising on your own</i>

721
00:35:33.469 --> 00:35:35.003
<i>teaches us all to believe</i>

722
00:35:35.272 --> 00:35:37.071
<i>that if you work hard enough.</i>

723
00:35:37.307 --> 00:35:38.969
<i>anything is possible.</i>

724
00:35:43.214 --> 00:35:45.343
<i>Climbing the economic ladder.</i>

725
00:35:45.612 --> 00:35:47.208
<i>It's as if race doesn't matter.</i>

726
00:35:47.377 --> 00:35:50.380
<i>gender. disability.</i>
<i>or anything else.</i>

727
00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:52.016
<i>It's magical thinking.</i>

728
00:35:52.184 --> 00:35:54.582
<i>and you can hear it</i>
<i>in the language we use.</i>

729
00:35:54.885 --> 00:35:56.560
<i>"Shooting the moon."</i>

730
00:35:57.063 --> 00:35:58.663
<i>"Reaching for the brass ring."</i>

731
00:35:59.399 --> 00:36:01.093
<i>"Pulling on your</i>
<i>own bootstraps."</i>

732
00:36:02.728 --> 00:36:04.195
<i>I mean. think about.</i>

733
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.035
<i>you can't pick yourself up</i>
<i>by anything on yourself.</i>

734
00:36:07.203 --> 00:36:08.570
<i>It's physics!</i>

735
00:36:10.675 --> 00:36:12.970
<i>But the language</i>
<i>is always about rising.</i>

736
00:36:14.179 --> 00:36:15.742
<i>Rising on your own.</i>

737
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:23.585
<i>My grandfather and great-uncle</i>
<i>did not rise alone.</i>

738
00:36:29.855 --> 00:36:31.855
<i>In the '50s. '60s. and '70s.</i>

739
00:36:32.024 --> 00:36:33.893
<i>a full-time worker</i>
<i>at Disneyland</i>

740
00:36:34.061 --> 00:36:37.195
<i>could afford</i>



741
00:36:37.397 --> 00:36:38.595
<i>a house.</i>

742
00:36:38.831 --> 00:36:41.029
<i>food in the fridge. a car.</i>

743
00:36:41.364 --> 00:36:43.132
<i>and the ability</i>
<i>to raise a family.</i>

744
00:36:46.747 --> 00:36:49.211
<i> I never intended</i>
<i>to make a career out of Disney.</i>

745
00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.148
<i>Never. It was a summer job.</i>

746
00:36:51.517 --> 00:36:54.215
<i>But you could advance</i>
<i>in the company.</i>

747
00:36:54.384 --> 00:36:55.945
<i>and if they realized</i>

748
00:36:56.247 --> 00:36:58.483
that you were really happy there
and worked well.

749
00:36:58.686 --> 00:37:00.125
then you got quite the raise.

750
00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.453
'cause I remember
all of a sudden.

751
00:37:01.688 --> 00:37:02.921
I was making pretty good money.

752
00:37:04.294 --> 00:37:05.793
<i>Roy talked about</i>

753
00:37:05.928 --> 00:37:08.592
<i>how he hoped</i>
<i>that some of us would go on</i>

754
00:37:08.828 --> 00:37:10.262
<i>to stay with the company.</i>

755
00:37:10.498 --> 00:37:12.296
<i>and he meant it!</i>

756
00:37:12.832 --> 00:37:14.534
Roy Disney. we call him "Roy."

757
00:37:14.703 --> 00:37:16.065
and they'll correct you
every time

758
00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:18.771
if you call him "Mr. Disney"
or "Mr. Tatum."

759
00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.571
and that... doesn't that
make you feel good?

760
00:37:20.706 --> 00:37:22.314
It does me.

761
00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:30.722
<i> I remember him</i>
<i>as a pretty regular guy.</i>

762
00:37:31.091 --> 00:37:32.716
<i>who lived a no-frills lifestyle</i>

763
00:37:32.852 --> 00:37:34.986
<i>by today's CEO standards.</i>

764
00:37:36.896 --> 00:37:37.921
<i>In fact.</i>

765
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.697
<i>in 1967. his pay.</i>
<i>including stock options.</i>

766
00:37:41.932 --> 00:37:45.535
<i>was just 78 times</i>
<i>his lowest worker's pay...</i>

767
00:37:46.672 --> 00:37:50.001
<i>which was typical</i>
<i>for a CEO of his time.</i>

768
00:37:52.102 --> 00:37:54.313
<i>So. what was different then?</i>

769
00:37:56.178 --> 00:38:01.049
<i> Why didn't executives</i>
<i>in the 1950s and '60s</i>

770
00:38:01.318 --> 00:38:03.349
give themselves the kind

771
00:38:03.684 --> 00:38:07.556
tremendous. tremendous salaries

772
00:38:07.791 --> 00:38:10.494
and bonuses and stock options
and everything?

773
00:38:11.823 --> 00:38:13.531
<i>You just didn't do it.</i>

774
00:38:14.267 --> 00:38:16.034
<i>There was a certain ethics.</i>

775
00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:18.337
<i>There was a certain way</i>
<i>you behave.</i>

776
00:38:20.903 --> 00:38:23.165
<i> Is it overly romantic</i>
<i>for me</i>

777
00:38:23.401 --> 00:38:25.269
to think of my grandfather
as someone who...

778
00:38:26.172 --> 00:38:27.638
you know.
thought about his employees

779
00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.804
as important partners and...

780
00:38:29.973 --> 00:38:32.044
and wanted to make sure

781
00:38:32.179 --> 00:38:34.111
that people could raise families
on their salaries?

782
00:38:34.347 --> 00:38:36.882
I don't think
it's overly romantic at all.

783
00:38:37.251 --> 00:38:38.888
You know. the motto
of the Harvard Business School

784
00:38:40.217 --> 00:38:43.020
"Making a decent profit
decently."

785
00:38:43.189 --> 00:38:44.830
- Really?
- Yeah.

786
00:38:45.199 --> 00:38:46.854
And that wasn't that unusual.

787
00:38:47.023 --> 00:38:49.498
It wasn't a crazy idea

788
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.569
that business was in service
to society.

789
00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:58.666
<i> So. the economic</i>
<i>situation we're currently in...</i>

790
00:38:58.835 --> 00:39:01.773
<i>I think a lot of people assume</i>
<i>is just what happens. right?</i>

791
00:39:01.908 --> 00:39:03.205
<i> Yeah. people think</i>

792
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.511
<i>the economy is</i>
<i>like the weather.</i>

793
00:39:04.646 --> 00:39:06.449
The economy is not the weather.

794
00:39:06.651 --> 00:39:08.851
it's not a set
of uncontrollable forces

795
00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:11.020
that we just have to sort of
try to protect ourselves from

796
00:39:11.188 --> 00:39:12.248
as possible.

797
00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:15.922
<i>People set the rules</i>
<i>for capitalism.</i>

798
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.354
<i>Greed's been with us forever.</i>

799
00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:21.597
<i>and there have always</i>
<i>been businessmen</i>

800
00:39:21.866 --> 00:39:23.934
<i>setting the rules</i>
<i>to favor themselves.</i>

801
00:39:24.303 --> 00:39:26.496
<i>so what was holding them back?</i>

802
00:39:28.138 --> 00:39:29.674
<i> In the middle</i>
<i>of the 20th century.</i>

803
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:33.368
<i>norms and laws set a different</i>
<i>standard and understanding</i>

804
00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:35.876
<i>in terms of</i>
<i>what Americans expected.</i>

805
00:39:36.045 --> 00:39:38.713
<i>That basically was</i>
<i>a social contract</i>

806
00:39:38.982 --> 00:39:41.218
<i>between business. government.</i>
<i>and labor</i>

807
00:39:41.387 --> 00:39:42.483
<i>that said. "You know what?</i>

808
00:39:42.685 --> 00:39:44.287
<i>We're all gonna do our part</i>

809
00:39:44.456 --> 00:39:46.216
<i>to ensure that we all have</i>

810
00:39:46.385 --> 00:39:48.589
<i>a pretty decent</i>
<i>standard of living."</i>

811
00:39:48.892 --> 00:39:51.995
And you had
really strong labor unions

812
00:39:52.197 --> 00:39:54.432
that gave workers

813
00:39:54.601 --> 00:39:58.098
a real voice
in the conditions of their work

814
00:39:58.267 --> 00:40:00.736
and of the business practices
and business strategies.

815
00:40:04.569 --> 00:40:07.441
It wasn't just
<i>the generosity of the CEOs</i>

816
00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:08.772
<i>that made capitalism</i>

817
00:40:08.974 --> 00:40:11.105
<i>a little more humane.</i>

818
00:40:11.708 --> 00:40:14.781
<i>It was that the labor movement</i>
<i>fought a fight.</i>

819
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.884
<i>and the government</i>
<i>backed them up</i>

820
00:40:17.052 --> 00:40:19.282
with worker laws...
workers' rights laws.

821
00:40:20.118 --> 00:40:21.383
<i> Those laws.</i>

822
00:40:21.518 --> 00:40:23.627
<i>in addition</i>
<i>to mid-century norms.</i>

823
00:40:24.096 --> 00:40:26.930
<i>are what kept my grandfather</i>
<i>and other CEOs in check.</i>

824
00:40:27.733 --> 00:40:29.733
<i>I remember talk</i>
<i>around the dinner table</i>

825
00:40:29.935 --> 00:40:33.236
<i>about the notorious strike</i>
<i>way back in 1941.</i>

826
00:40:33.405 --> 00:40:34.934
<i>when nearly every worker</i>

827
00:40:35.203 --> 00:40:37.476
<i>walked off the job</i>
<i>to protest unfair pay.</i>

828
00:40:38.277 --> 00:40:39.940
<i>Grandpa and Uncle Walt</i>

829
00:40:40.076 --> 00:40:41.770
<i>didn't like being told</i>
<i>what to do by anyone.</i>

830
00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:43.812
<i>but they didn't have a choice.</i>

831
00:40:45.578 --> 00:40:48.276
<i> Walt did everything</i>
<i>he possibly could.</i>

832
00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:51.853
<i>but unions</i>
<i>were incredibly powerful.</i>

833
00:40:53.418 --> 00:40:55.450
And so. Walt Disney
had to capitulate.

834
00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:01.462
<i>In terms of how employees</i>
<i>were treated more often</i>

835
00:41:01.597 --> 00:41:03.231
<i>and how companies</i>

836
00:41:03.533 --> 00:41:05.229
did not feel required

837
00:41:05.464 --> 00:41:09.403
to take out every last possible
penny like Scrooge.

838
00:41:09.539 --> 00:41:11.037
um... it was different.

839
00:41:12.207 --> 00:41:14.542
<i>You know.</i>
<i>in the 1950s and '60s and '70s.</i>

840
00:41:14.711 --> 00:41:16.107
<i>tax rates on corporations</i>

841
00:41:16.442 --> 00:41:19.380
were high. higher
than they've been in 50 years.

842
00:41:19.582 --> 00:41:21.110
<i>And yet it worked out.</i>

843
00:41:21.446 --> 00:41:22.983
<i>It built up all</i>
<i>kinds of things.</i>

844
00:41:26.018 --> 00:41:27.119
<i>The interstate highways.</i>

845
00:41:27.354 --> 00:41:28.851
<i>they were brand new</i>
<i>and they were wonderful</i>

846
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.117
and it was fantastic!

847
00:41:30.286 --> 00:41:31.495
And. of course. it funneled

848
00:41:31.697 --> 00:41:33.364
<i>all those hundreds</i>
<i>and thousands</i>

849
00:41:33.633 --> 00:41:36.062
<i>and millions of people</i>
<i>to Disneyland.</i>

850
00:41:37.767 --> 00:41:39.294
<i> This is Disneyland.</i>

851
00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:41.529
<i>Since its opening.</i>
<i>50 million people.</i>

852
00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.733
<i>or over one-fourth</i>
<i>of America's population.</i>

853
00:41:43.935 --> 00:41:45.243
<i>have come here.</i>

854
00:41:45.445 --> 00:41:47.071
<i>And in ten years. almost one</i>

855
00:41:47.307 --> 00:41:48.680
<i>billion dollars</i>
<i>have been spent.</i>

856
00:41:48.815 --> 00:41:50.841
<i>all because of tourist money</i>
<i>generated</i>

857
00:41:51.076 --> 00:41:52.782

<i>in this vast</i>
<i>Orange County area.</i>

859
00:41:58.491 --> 00:41:59.690
<i> It sure seemed</i>

860
00:41:59.859 --> 00:42:01.758
<i>like money</i>
<i>was trickling down then...</i>

861
00:42:02.928 --> 00:42:05.193
<i>even as companies</i>
<i>were making profits</i>

862
00:42:06.029 --> 00:42:07.731
<i>and the economy</i>
<i>was going gangbusters.</i>

863
00:42:09.694 --> 00:42:12.933
<i> You had</i>
<i>the big hallmarks we think of</i>

864
00:42:13.269 --> 00:42:15.965
<i>as middle-class life.</i>
<i>paid for by tax dollars.</i>

865
00:42:16.601 --> 00:42:19.610
<i>Things like</i>
<i>massively subsidized housing.</i>

866
00:42:20.046 --> 00:42:22.912
<i>the ability for someone</i>
<i>on a working-class income</i>

867
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:26.717
<i>to get into home ownership</i>
<i>without a down payment.</i>

868
00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.715
<i>And the government subsidized</i>

869
00:42:28.884 --> 00:42:30.919
<i>healthcare. free college.</i>

870
00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:33.417
<i>It was the creation</i>

871
00:42:33.786 --> 00:42:35.252
<i>of the greatest middleclass</i>
<i>the world had ever seen.</i>

872
00:42:35.488 --> 00:42:37.354
<i>the highest standard of living</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

873
00:42:38.221 --> 00:42:39.860
<i>The American Dream</i>

874
00:42:40.063 --> 00:42:42.700
was a gift
of the American government.

875
00:42:55.279 --> 00:42:57.110
<i> But it was</i>
<i>largely for whites only.</i>

876
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.757
<i> So. everything about</i>
<i>the collective social contract</i>

877
00:43:05.892 --> 00:43:07.148
<i>that built what we call</i>
<i>"the middleclass"</i>

878
00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:08.322
<i>in the United States</i>

879
00:43:08.958 --> 00:43:10.926
- was racialized.
- Yes.

880
00:43:14.131 --> 00:43:16.360
<i> Like so many</i>
<i>white people.</i>

881
00:43:16.495 --> 00:43:18.467
<i>growing up.</i>
<i>I hadn't been taught</i>

882
00:43:18.636 --> 00:43:20.101
<i>that government policies</i>

883
00:43:20.436 --> 00:43:23.203
<i>had actively stacked the deck</i>
<i>against people of color</i>

884
00:43:23.772 --> 00:43:25.005
<i>by limiting access</i>

885
00:43:25.241 --> 00:43:28.141
<i>to all those on-ramps</i>
<i>to the American Dream.</i>

886
00:43:34.316 --> 00:43:36.611
<i> In the United States.</i>
<i>we so often...</i>

887
00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.519
don't want to see...

888
00:43:39.955 --> 00:43:42.153
the harm. the exploitation...

889
00:43:42.288 --> 00:43:44.025
- Uh-huh.
- The power.

890
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.520
It's...

891
00:43:46.856 --> 00:43:49.091
that's the Disneyfication
of American history

892
00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:50.834
and of our American story.

893
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:55.403
<i> To all who come</i>

894

00:44:03.949 --> 00:44:05.643
<i> And there's</i>
<i>Aunt Jemima!</i>

897
00:44:09.783 --> 00:44:12.087
<i> It's painful.</i>
<i>and it took me a long time</i>

898
00:44:12.289 --> 00:44:14.324
<i>to fully comprehend the role</i>
<i>that my family.</i>

899

<i>the people that I loved.</i>

900
00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.523

<i>seem perfectly natural</i>

904
00:44:36.516 --> 00:44:37.738
<i> You know.</i>

905
00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.409
<i>our original economic model</i>
<i>in this country</i>

906
00:44:39.845 --> 00:44:42.919
<i>was stolen land. stolen people.</i>
<i>and stolen labor.</i>

907
00:44:46.482 --> 00:44:49.257
<i>It's an economy in which</i>

908
00:44:49.392 --> 00:44:51.895
<i>white men are sitting</i>
<i>at the top of a hierarchy.</i>

909
00:44:54.999 --> 00:44:56.768
<i>That's really our</i>
<i>founding myth.</i>

910
00:44:58.699 --> 00:45:00.899
<i>The idea that some people</i>
<i>and groups of people</i>

911
00:45:01.035 --> 00:45:02.433

912
00:45:05.607 --> 00:45:07.241
<i> Here I am.</i>

913
00:45:07.377 --> 00:45:09.240
I've got my whole family

You know. this is a Main Street.
ladies and gentlemen.

916
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.452
just like my grandma used
to tell me about

917
00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:16.788
back in Joplin. Missouri.

918
00:45:20.455 --> 00:45:22.618
<i> When he created</i>
<i>those amusement parks.</i>

919
00:45:22.787 --> 00:45:25.629
Walt Disney created
not only a false reality.

920
00:45:25.832 --> 00:45:28.459
but he also changed
reality itself.

921
00:45:33.738 --> 00:45:35.296
<i>As Disneyland was being built.</i>

922
00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:37.468
<i>Walt was very conscious</i>

923
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:40.207
<i>of creating that berm</i>
<i>around the park.</i>

924
00:45:40.375 --> 00:45:42.479
<i>And the idea of creating</i>
<i>that berm was</i>

925
00:45:42.682 --> 00:45:44.244
that reality was out there...

926
00:45:45.079 --> 00:45:46.708
and it didn't invade here.

927
00:45:57.425 --> 00:45:58.954
<i>But outside the berm.</i>

928
00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:02.328
<i>it was getting harder and</i>
<i>harder to ignore reality.</i>

929
00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:06.261
<i> People of color</i>
<i>were suddenly saying.</i>

930
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.139
<i>"We want a seat at the table."</i>

931
00:46:08.475 --> 00:46:09.599
"We've been contributing

932
00:46:09.735 --> 00:46:11.838
to this great American engine
of prosperity

933
00:46:11.974 --> 00:46:14.307
and we want our shot too."

934
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:23.110
<i>When the Civil Rights Movement</i>
<i>and the gains in the courts</i>

935
00:46:23.279 --> 00:46:26.450
<i>empowered Black Americans.</i>
<i>the federal government switched</i>

936
00:46:26.619 --> 00:46:28.759
from being the enforcer
of the racial hierarchy

937
00:46:28.895 --> 00:46:31.291
to the up-ender
of the racial hierarchy.

938
00:46:39.172 --> 00:46:42.271
<i>And millions of Americans.</i>
<i>white Americans.</i>

939
00:46:42.406 --> 00:46:45.140
<i>who had been taught to disdain</i>
<i>and distrust Black Americans.</i>

940
00:46:45.275 --> 00:46:47.274
<i>felt betrayed</i>
<i>by that government.</i>

941
00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.051
<i> The sense of</i>
<i>betrayal white Americans felt</i>

942
00:46:54.287 --> 00:46:57.482
<i>planted a deep seed of mistrust</i>
<i>in the government...</i>

943
00:46:59.149 --> 00:47:02.054
<i>which would only expand</i>
<i>across the political spectrum</i>

944
00:47:02.523 --> 00:47:04.720
<i>as unrest continued</i>
<i>into the 1970s.</i>

945
00:47:07.228 --> 00:47:08.493
<i> All kinds of people</i>

946
00:47:08.629 --> 00:47:10.325
<i>weren't so crazy</i>
<i>about the government</i>

947
00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:11.934
<i>for a lot of reasons.</i>

948
00:47:12.503 --> 00:47:14.263
<i>There was all this talk</i>
<i>of revolution and socialism</i>

949
00:47:14.399 --> 00:47:15.566
<i>and everything else.</i>

950
00:47:18.371 --> 00:47:20.438
<i>Many CEOs and rich people</i>

951
00:47:20.674 --> 00:47:23.710
<i>who wanted to maximize</i>
<i>their wealth and power</i>

952
00:47:23.879 --> 00:47:25.049
<i>thought. like.</i>

953
00:47:25.351 --> 00:47:26.876
<i>"My God. are the guillotines</i>
<i>gonna come for us?"</i>

954
00:47:27.512 --> 00:47:29.049
<i>Some of 'em thought that.</i>

955
00:47:29.619 --> 00:47:31.588
And they thought. "We gotta
get together and stop this

956
00:47:31.791 --> 00:47:33.188
or we're gonna be washed away.

957
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:36.690
and the anti-business sentiment
is just gonna ruin us."

958
00:47:39.123 --> 00:47:40.989
<i> The business class</i>
<i>may have been fearful.</i>

959
00:47:41.158 --> 00:47:44.000
<i>but in all this upheaval.</i>
<i>they saw an opportunity</i>

960
00:47:44.169 --> 00:47:46.228
<i>to use white</i>
<i>fear and insecurity</i>

961
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.835
<i>to sell a new economic story.</i>

962
00:47:49.738 --> 00:47:52.537
<i> They began</i>
<i>to see that white Americans</i>

963
00:47:52.706 --> 00:47:55.936
<i>would turn away from government</i>
<i>and unions</i>

964
00:47:56.138 --> 00:47:58.813
<i>and towards the quote-unquote</i>
<i>"free market."</i>

965
00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:02.911
<i>And that's when we began</i>
<i>to see the business class</i>

966
00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.747
<i>really organized.</i>
<i>with a message that said.</i>

967
00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:08.057
basically. "Turn your back
on the formula

968
00:48:08.259 --> 00:48:10.786
that created your own
middleclass prosperity."

969
00:48:14.063 --> 00:48:16.929
<i>And what we see today is</i>

970
00:48:17.131 --> 00:48:18.598
<i>we have an economy</i>

971
00:48:18.767 --> 00:48:21.629
<i>that always existed</i>
<i>for Black and brown people.</i>

972
00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:23.635
<i>and yet now.</i>
<i>it's existing</i>

973
00:48:23.803 --> 00:48:26.472
<i>for nearly the majority</i>
<i>of American workers.</i>

974
00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:31.748
<i>If you build into any system</i>

975
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:34.316
a belief in a hierarchy
of human value

976
00:48:34.451 --> 00:48:36.713
that gives permission
to exploitation of anyone.

977
00:48:36.948 --> 00:48:40.618
ultimately. that system
will sort of swallow us all.

978
00:49:08.151 --> 00:49:09.383
<i> All across America.</i>

979
00:49:09.618 --> 00:49:12.181

<i>Here's what's new at 2:05.</i>

985
00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:29.666
<i>Disney will furlough 30.000</i>

<i>of its workers</i>
<i>in Anaheim alone.</i>

987
00:49:32.108 --> 00:49:34.111
<i>An additional 43.000...</i>

988
00:49:35.613 --> 00:49:37.940
<i> What the company</i>
<i>is asking them to do</i>

989
00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:40.043
<i>is to certainly apply</i>
<i>for state benefits</i>

990
00:49:40.345 --> 00:49:41.448
<i>in the interim.</i>

991
00:49:43.621 --> 00:49:46.118
<i> With no clarity</i>
<i>about whether or when</i>

992
00:49:46.287 --> 00:49:48.315
<i>permanent layoffs would come.</i>

993
00:49:48.751 --> 00:49:50.019
<i>cast members wondered</i>

994
00:49:50.288 --> 00:49:52.657
<i>how long their unemployment</i>
<i>benefits would hold out.</i>

995
00:49:56.302 --> 00:49:58.962
To try to keep things
fun and interesting.

996
00:49:59.131 --> 00:50:01.798
we are in our tent camping
in the front yard.

997
00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:03.406
Cold!

998
00:50:03.975 --> 00:50:05.137
It can't be cold. honey.

999
00:50:05.306 --> 00:50:06.938
Mommy just got it off the grill.

1000
00:50:07.173 --> 00:50:08.444
It is cold!

1001
00:50:08.646 --> 00:50:09.880
Feel it!

1002
00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:12.340
Okay. I'll find a way
to heat it back up.

1003
00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:13.945
How dare you?!

1004
00:50:14.314 --> 00:50:15.517
How dare you?!

1005
00:50:15.853 --> 00:50:17.682
How dare you?!

1006
00:50:22.828 --> 00:50:25.120
It's raining!

1007
00:50:27.329 --> 00:50:28.456
You like camping. huh?

1008
00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:29.799
Mm-hm. in the rain!

1009
00:50:30.002 --> 00:50:31.358
In the rain!

1010
00:50:31.527 --> 00:50:32.763
I like it.

1011
00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:37.066
It's good to see everybody!

1012
00:50:37.535 --> 00:50:38.768
There you go!

1013
00:50:38.904 --> 00:50:40.441
<i>So. how's everybody doing?</i>

1014
00:50:41.972 --> 00:50:43.609
It's the same day
it's always been.

1015
00:50:43.744 --> 00:50:45.340
Tomorrow. I'll let you know
about tomorrow.

1016
00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:46.379
And after that.

1017
00:50:46.748 --> 00:50:47.917
I'll let you know
about the day after that.

1018
00:50:48.052 --> 00:50:49.285
You gotta roll with the punches.

1019
00:50:52.188 --> 00:50:53.684
<i>People say. you know.</i>

1020
00:50:53.819 --> 00:50:55.721
<i>"We're worried</i>

1021
00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:57.721
<i>It's kinda hard to get worried</i>

1022
00:50:57.856 --> 00:50:59.028
<i>that you never</i>

1023

<i>to have in the first place.</i>

1024
00:51:03.401 --> 00:51:05.466
We're coming here
to Michael's high school

1025
00:51:05.668 --> 00:51:08.172
and seeing if we can
pick up food for everybody.

1026
00:51:09.635 --> 00:51:11.668
- Four.
- Four?

1027
00:51:11.871 --> 00:51:13.973
- You like her mask?

1028
00:51:14.141 --> 00:51:15.475
It's so pretty!

1029
00:51:15.644 --> 00:51:17.878
- Thank you!

1030
00:51:18.881 --> 00:51:20.481
<i> Just worried</i>

1031
00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:23.077

1034
00:51:40.702 --> 00:51:42.433

1035
00:51:43.035 --> 00:51:46.100

1036
00:51:47.638 --> 00:51:49.141

1037
00:51:49.877 --> 00:51:52.109
Hopefully.
I get to do that someday.

1038
00:51:52.912 --> 00:51:54.844
But the way things
are going right now...

1039
00:51:55.046 --> 00:51:57.419
it's not looking
so good.

1040
00:52:01.085 --> 00:52:03.156
I don't know
if I'll ever be able to...

1041
00:52:03.325 --> 00:52:05.955
move out from...

1042
00:52:06.992 --> 00:52:09.365
my parents' home.
You know?

1043
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:13.471
I'll just never move out.

1044
00:52:13.706 --> 00:52:14.531
Yeah.

1045
00:52:14.666 --> 00:52:16.966
Are you okay with that?

1046
00:52:18.637 --> 00:52:20.574
I just feel sad about it.

1047
00:52:21.642 --> 00:52:24.642
I feel sad
that I can't even help.

1048
00:52:24.811 --> 00:52:26.815
- Yeah.
- Because I need help.

1049
00:52:31.385 --> 00:52:32.685
It'll work out.

1050
00:52:42.332 --> 00:52:44.158

1051
00:52:45.170 --> 00:52:47.667

And every time

1063
00:53:31.678 --> 00:53:33.977
we'd lose something emotional.

1064
00:53:36.115 --> 00:53:37.978
I used to have my mom's ID.

1065
00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.884

1066

And I can't find that anymore.

1067
00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:47.397

1195
01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:03.971
"You. too. can be rich."

1196
01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:09.773
<i>And he marketed it</i>
<i>extremely well.</i>

1197
01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:17.148
My friends.

1198
01:00:17.617 --> 01:00:20.449
thank you again for the gift
of this magnificent parade.

1199
01:00:21.216 --> 01:00:22.358
Tomorrow evening.

1200
01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:24.091
I will address the nation

1201
01:00:24.226 --> 01:00:27.420
about a dramatic proposal
to reform our tax system

1202
01:00:27.623 --> 01:00:30.725
to launch a new
American revolution

1203
01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:33.035
and expand our economic freedom.

1204
01:00:38.342 --> 01:00:40.874
<i> It became known</i>
<i>as "trickle-down economics."</i>

1205
01:00:41.443 --> 01:00:44.374
<i>If the rich get richer.</i>
<i>then it'll help everybody.</i>

1206
01:00:46.511 --> 01:00:48.011
<i> Of course.</i>
<i>the result was</i>

1207
01:00:48.147 --> 01:00:50.084
<i>a set of policy changes...</i>

1208
01:00:50.653 --> 01:00:52.489
<i>slashing tax rates</i>

1209
01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:54.849
<i>on millionaires</i>
<i>and corporations.</i>

1210
01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:56.716
<i>gutting social spending</i>

1211
01:00:56.885 --> 01:00:59.486
<i>that really helped</i>
<i>working-class families.</i>

1212
01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:02.557
<i>and then. of course.</i>
<i>attacking unions.</i>

1213
01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:06.065
It really signaled the end of

1214
01:01:06.267 --> 01:01:09.663
the reign of organized labor
in the country

1215
01:01:09.965 --> 01:01:12.701
<i>as a way for millions</i>
<i>of workers to demand</i>

1216
01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:15.977
<i>an equal slice of the pie</i>
<i>they spent all day baking.</i>

1217
01:01:19.545 --> 01:01:20.712
<i> The changes</i>
<i>that came</i>

1218
01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:22.719
<i>with this free market ideology</i>

1219
01:01:22.854 --> 01:01:24.883
<i>were reflected</i>
<i>inside of Disney.</i>

1220
01:01:25.386 --> 01:01:28.219
<i>after my father helped</i>
<i>bring in a new CEO</i>

1221
01:01:28.621 --> 01:01:31.685
<i>and corporate priorities</i>
<i>drastically changed.</i>

1222
01:01:33.361 --> 01:01:35.195
<i> Management</i>
<i>wants the workers</i>

1223
01:01:35.397 --> 01:01:37.191
<i>to give up some</i>
<i>of what they already have.</i>

1224
01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.897
<i>asking a three-year wage freeze</i>

1225
01:01:39.033 --> 01:01:40.633
<i>and some cuts in benefits.</i>

1226
01:01:40.869 --> 01:01:41.903
<i> Workers say</i>

1227
01:01:42.172 --> 01:01:44.432
<i>they cannot accept</i>
<i>a two-year wage freeze.</i>

1228
01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:46.073
<i>and they say</i>
<i>they cannot understand</i>

1229
01:01:46.242 --> 01:01:48.875
<i>the company's attitude</i>
<i>towards its employees.</i>

1230
01:01:49.444 --> 01:01:51.409
The morale has been really down.
and I honestly can say

1231
01:01:51.544 --> 01:01:53.311
I don't think it'll ever be
the same out there.

1232
01:01:55.121 --> 01:01:57.379
<i> Disneyland will open</i>
<i>this morning as usual.</i>

1233
01:01:57.682 --> 01:01:59.889
<i>with or without</i>
<i>its union employees.</i>

1234
01:02:01.055 --> 01:02:02.255
<i> They discovered</i>

1235
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:03.784
<i>they didn't have to</i>
<i>spend so much money</i>

1236
01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:06.720
<i>on people that they no longer</i>
<i>appreciated anyway.</i>

1237
01:02:08.857 --> 01:02:11.100
I was appalled
at what they were telling me.

1238
01:02:11.536 --> 01:02:12.593
and I just thought.

1239
01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.035
"Well. this isn't
the company I knew."

1240
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.103
<i>It was part and parcel</i>

1241
01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:21.135
<i>of this treating workers</i>
<i>and employees</i>

1242
01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.642
more and more like...

1243
01:02:23.212 --> 01:02:25.948
cogs. like something
less than people.

1244
01:02:28.883 --> 01:02:30.144
<i>Around this same time.</i>

1245
01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:31.714
<i>the average CEO</i>

1246
01:02:31.883 --> 01:02:34.754
<i>went from being paid</i>
<i>60 times the average worker</i>

1247
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.526
<i>to 100. to 200. to 300.</i>

1248
01:02:36.728 --> 01:02:38.419
<i>to 600 times. in some cases.</i>

1249
01:02:44.637 --> 01:02:46.362
<i>And that's just because...</i>

1250
01:02:46.664 --> 01:02:50.369
it was decided that they
could get away with it.

1251
01:02:56.171 --> 01:02:59.014
<i> The "they"</i>
<i>in this case was Wall Street.</i>

1252
01:02:59.183 --> 01:03:01.676
<i>where a lot of things</i>
<i>were suddenly possible</i>

1253
01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:04.178
<i>on what would become</i>
<i>the proving ground</i>

1254
01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:06.153
<i>for the free market ideology.</i>

1255
01:03:07.385 --> 01:03:08.581
<i> You know. I think of it</i>

1256
01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:10.952
as the asshole-ification
of America.

1257
01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:12.494
Totally!

1258
01:03:12.663 --> 01:03:15.261
A word I... yes. indeed.

1259
01:03:15.463 --> 01:03:17.532
<i>It is the asshole-ification</i>
<i>of America.</i>

1260
01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:30.403
This...

1261
01:03:30.839 --> 01:03:32.809
This is a great view
from up here.

1262
01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:41.752
<i> You bet it was</i>
<i>a great view from up there.</i>

1263
01:03:42.188 --> 01:03:43.827
<i>And for the next four decades.</i>

1264
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:45.923
<i>Wall Street</i>
<i>and corporate America</i>

1265
01:03:46.225 --> 01:03:48.262
<i>would spend billions lobbying</i>

1266
01:03:48.397 --> 01:03:50.863
<i>to dismantle almost every law</i>
<i>and regulation</i>

1267
01:03:50.998 --> 01:03:52.568
<i>keeping them in check.</i>

1268
01:03:52.837 --> 01:03:54.498
<i>stacking the deck further</i>

1269
01:03:54.633 --> 01:03:56.505
<i>and further against</i>
<i>Main Street.</i>

1270
01:03:56.874 --> 01:03:58.403
<i>Rather than trickle down.</i>

1271
01:03:58.705 --> 01:04:02.077
<i>money has flowed relentlessly</i>
<i>up to people like me.</i>

1272
01:04:03.344 --> 01:04:05.849
Well. you know.
trickling down always.

1273
01:04:05.985 --> 01:04:07.511
to me. sounded like urine.
right?

1274
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.880
I mean.
that's what trickles. right?

1275
01:04:10.315 --> 01:04:12.487
Yeah. exactly. exactly.

1276
01:04:12.655 --> 01:04:13.881
Do you know

1277
01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:15.686
that there was a version
of trickle-down economics

1278
01:04:15.988 --> 01:04:17.419
in the 1890s

1279
01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:21.531
<i>that was described as</i>
<i>the "Horse and Sparrow Theory"?</i>

1280
01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:23.728
<i>If the horse eats enough oats.</i>

1281
01:04:24.664 --> 01:04:26.435
<i>they make their way</i>
<i>through the horse.</i>

1282
01:04:26.871 --> 01:04:28.831
<i>and the sparrow gets 'em.</i>

1283
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.501
Ooh!

1284
01:04:31.738 --> 01:04:33.675
<i> And yet.</i>
<i>that trickle-down story</i>

1285
01:04:33.844 --> 01:04:35.712
<i>just will not die...</i>

1286
01:04:36.382 --> 01:04:38.773
<i>- no matter how much it stinks.</i>

1287
01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.765
<i> Big announcement</i>
<i>from Disney.</i>

1288
01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:05.470
<i>and not a good one</i>
<i>for Disney employees.</i>

1289
01:05:06.811 --> 01:05:08.271
<i>Today. Disney announced</i>

1290
01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.307
<i>that it will be laying off</i>

1291
01:05:10.676 --> 01:05:13.214
<i>about 28.000</i>
<i>domestic employees.</i>

1292
01:05:22.355 --> 01:05:23.884
<i> "Dear cast member...</i>

1293
01:05:24.862 --> 01:05:26.722
<i>The COVID-19 pandemic</i>

1294
01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:30.099
<i>has had a significant impact</i>
<i>on our businesses."</i>

1295
01:05:31.567 --> 01:05:34.165
<i>"We have made</i>
<i>the very difficult decision</i>

1296
01:05:34.301 --> 01:05:36.303
<i>to reduce our workforce."</i>

1297
01:05:44.809 --> 01:05:46.382
It makes me scared.

1298
01:05:47.978 --> 01:05:51.021
Knowing that that many people
lost their jobs now...

1299
01:05:52.918 --> 01:05:55.218
and I might end up losing mine
somewhere down the line.

1300
01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.027
and I don't wanna lose it.

1301
01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:03.193
It's the ice cream guy.

1302
01:06:03.362 --> 01:06:04.696
Glad the kids aren't here.

1303
01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:08.398
See?
I know how to make you smile.

1304
01:06:08.601 --> 01:06:10.568
- Took me a second.

1305
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:15.844
You know. been through
rough times before.

1306
01:06:15.979 --> 01:06:17.773
this is just a different format.

1307
01:06:18.743 --> 01:06:19.876
Don't worry about it.
I got this.

1308
01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:23.051
- I got this!
- We just laugh...

1309
01:06:23.253 --> 01:06:24.550
When I say the words
"I got this."

1310
01:06:24.752 --> 01:06:27.121
it means "I ain't got
a f... clue what I'm gonna do.

1311
01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:29.450
but I gotta think
of something fast.

1312
01:06:29.619 --> 01:06:30.984
'cause this shit is sinking.

1313
01:06:31.152 --> 01:06:33.325
It's like the Titanic
and another... like.

1314
01:06:33.494 --> 01:06:34.822
the icebergs are
ganging up and they're.

1315
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:36.990
like. attacking the boat now.

1316
01:06:46.171 --> 01:06:49.003
<i> The color of the day</i>
<i>is green on Wall Street.</i>

1317
01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:51.912
All three major indices
closed at record high levels.

1318
01:06:52.081 --> 01:06:53.548
<i>As stocks continue...</i>

1319
01:06:53.717 --> 01:06:56.284
<i> No matter how bad</i>
<i>things got for workers.</i>

1320
01:06:56.486 --> 01:06:58.512
<i>Wall Street continued</i>
<i>to ride high.</i>

1321
01:06:59.249 --> 01:07:01.616
Disney could not have written
a better comeback story.

1322
01:07:01.819 --> 01:07:03.387
The stock back
at all-time highs.

1323
01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:06.753
Disney+ up big
over the Christmas holiday.

1324
01:07:06.921 --> 01:07:08.098
<i> Fans rejoiced over</i>

1325
01:07:08.267 --> 01:07:10.296
<i>upcoming Star Wars</i>
<i>and Marvel movies.</i>

1326
01:07:10.565 --> 01:07:12.861
<i>and stockholders</i>
<i>celebrated too.</i>

1327
01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:15.765
<i>Well. most of them.</i>

1328
01:07:15.967 --> 01:07:18.108
<i>Abigail Disney</i>
<i>had a different reaction.</i>

1329
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:21.101
<i>Her take was that share prices</i>
<i>were divorced</i>

1330
01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:23.437
<i>from what was happening</i>
<i>to the company's workers.</i>

1331
01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.774
<i>and she called that</i>

1332
01:07:25.110 --> 01:07:27.508
<i>"a complete moral breakdown</i>
<i>of this entire system."</i>

1333
01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:32.188
<i> I don't believe</i>
<i>the company and the magic</i>

1334
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:35.125
<i>can survive this kind</i>
<i>of corporate behavior.</i>

1335
01:07:35.327 --> 01:07:36.887
<i> I think you</i>
<i>see this more broadly.</i>

1336
01:07:37.056 --> 01:07:39.726
<i>not as a Disney problem</i>
<i>and emblematic of the problem</i>

1337
01:07:39.895 --> 01:07:42.224
<i>in boardrooms and corporate</i>
<i>cultures across this country.</i>

1338
01:07:42.392 --> 01:07:44.399
<i> I'm saying...</i>
<i>it's time to do it differently.</i>

1339
01:07:44.568 --> 01:07:46.732
<i>and I don't care</i>
<i>what the business school says.</i>

1340
01:07:46.901 --> 01:07:49.837
<i>There's a certain level</i>
<i>below which you cannot go</i>

1341
01:07:50.073 --> 01:07:51.603
<i>in the name of human decency.</i>

1342
01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:18.761
You guys are ready
to move up.

1343
01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:20.562
Merry Christmas and stay safe.
all right?

1344
01:08:20.864 --> 01:08:22.430
Merry Christmas.
thank you!

1345
01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:24.933
Have a merry Christmas.
now.

1346
01:08:28.307 --> 01:08:29.806
They just told me

1347
01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:32.582
that there are over 300 people
in this line.

1348
01:08:32.784 --> 01:08:34.349
and I believe it.

1349
01:08:36.287 --> 01:08:38.282
The line pretty much
wraps around

1350
01:08:38.484 --> 01:08:40.080
this entire neighborhood.

1351
01:08:41.289 --> 01:08:42.984
All of us need this help.

1352
01:08:49.462 --> 01:08:50.899
All right.

1353
01:08:51.135 --> 01:08:52.526
All right. here you go.

1354
01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:54.127
This time. we got wipes.

1355
01:08:56.506 --> 01:08:58.472
I hear you've
been real good boys.

1356
01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.507
- Really?!
- That's what I heard.

1357
01:09:01.643 --> 01:09:03.340
You're on the Nice List.
aren't you?

1358
01:09:03.509 --> 01:09:04.745
You're on the Nice List?

1359
01:09:04.947 --> 01:09:06.549
Yeah?

1360
01:09:07.285 --> 01:09:09.377
Remember the PS5
and the Switch!

1361
01:09:12.119 --> 01:09:13.720
Ho ho ho!

1362
01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:25.399
<i> I just read</i>
<i>an article about Bob Iger.</i>

1363
01:09:25.601 --> 01:09:27.363
<i>He literally became</i>
<i>a billionaire</i>

1364
01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:29.229
<i>right before the holidays.</i>

1365
01:09:30.365 --> 01:09:32.871
<i>So. he got a</i>
<i>wonderful Christmas present.</i>

1366
01:09:33.007 --> 01:09:35.575
<i>while everybody else</i>
<i>was being handed pink slips.</i>

1367
01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:38.171
<i>That doesn't make sense.</i>

1368
01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:53.293
<i> When we have</i>
<i>a pandemic. as we've had.</i>

1369
01:09:53.762 --> 01:09:57.432
where almost 60 new
billionaires were minted.

1370
01:09:57.601 --> 01:09:59.698
where the billionaire class
increased their wealth

1371
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.834
by almost 50 percent.
while tens of millions of people

1372
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:04.804
went without.

1373
01:10:05.273 --> 01:10:07.869
this inequality economy

1374
01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:10.204
is one that honestly looks
a lot more

1375
01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:13.211
like the Gilded Age
and the plantation economy

1376
01:10:13.413 --> 01:10:15.646
than the one that we

1377
01:10:15.781 --> 01:10:17.621
associate
with the American Dream.

1378
01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:43.303
<i> Well.</i>
<i>the happiest place on Earth</i>

1379
01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:46.113
<i>is giving people</i>
<i>a big reason to smile today.</i>

1380
01:10:46.249 --> 01:10:48.143
<i>Disneyland is back open</i>

1381
01:10:48.378 --> 01:10:50.654
<i>after being shut down</i>
<i>for more than a year!</i>

1382
01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:53.315
<i> For the city</i>
<i>of Anaheim this morning.</i>

1383
01:10:53.451 --> 01:10:56.491
<i>reopening. it's a big step</i>
<i>toward economic recovery.</i>

1384
01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.856
<i>For the fans.</i>
<i>it's just a day of excitement.</i>

1385
01:11:00.388 --> 01:11:02.330
<i>As the park reopened.</i>

1386
01:11:02.632 --> 01:11:05.197
<i>Ellie. Artemis.</i>
<i>Ralph. and Trina</i>

1387
01:11:05.433 --> 01:11:07.101
<i>were all called back to work.</i>

1388
01:11:07.804 --> 01:11:11.402
Shoulder to shoulder
against corporate greed!

1389
01:11:11.971 --> 01:11:13.107
<i>But many cast members</i>

1390
01:11:13.242 --> 01:11:14.806
<i>were not brought back.</i>

1391
01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:19.082
<i> A bunch of my crew</i>
<i>is still laid off.</i>

1392
01:11:19.751 --> 01:11:22.947
<i>There are still so many</i>
<i>messed up things happening.</i>

1393
01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:26.621
Shoulder to shoulder
against corporate greed!

1394
01:11:26.789 --> 01:11:28.821
Shoulder to shoulder.
more respect and dignity.

1395
01:11:28.956 --> 01:11:30.651
How much are those little ears.

1396
01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.256
the Mickey Mouse ears?!

1397
01:11:32.425 --> 01:11:33.328
Thirty!

1398
01:11:33.497 --> 01:11:34.825
Thirty dollars!

1399
01:11:34.961 --> 01:11:36.699
And how much
are Disney workers making?

1400
01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:37.826
Fifteen.

1401
01:11:37.995 --> 01:11:39.463
Fifteen bucks!

1402
01:11:39.599 --> 01:11:40.863
How about somebody with...

1403
01:11:41.066 --> 01:11:42.829
<i> Our workload</i>
<i>has increased.</i>

1404
01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.869
<i>our wages are the same.</i>

1405
01:11:47.508 --> 01:11:49.442
<i>It's just a never-ending fight.</i>

1406
01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:54.846
<i> I don't have</i>
<i>love for the company anymore.</i>

1407
01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:58.919
Hey. everyone.
I'm a Disney cast member.

1408
01:11:59.121 --> 01:12:00.317
I'm a custodian!

1409
01:12:00.485 --> 01:12:01.918
I really wanted

1410
01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.820
to quote Walt Disney
for you guys right now!

1411
01:12:03.989 --> 01:12:05.525
"You can design and create
and build

1412
01:12:05.694 --> 01:12:07.695
the most wonderful place
in the world.

1413
01:12:07.897 --> 01:12:10.997
but it takes people
to make the dream a reality!"

1414
01:12:12.668 --> 01:12:14.503
Thank you!
Well said. Ellie!

1415
01:12:15.838 --> 01:12:18.199
Okay. gracias.
thank you for coming out.

1416
01:12:26.713 --> 01:12:28.517
After my time with the union.

1417
01:12:28.819 --> 01:12:31.850
I've come to really appreciate
the work that they do.

1418
01:12:33.691 --> 01:12:35.519
I hear you're
going back to college!

1419
01:12:35.788 --> 01:12:37.519
So. what are you gonna study?

1420
01:12:37.655 --> 01:12:38.584
Labor studies.

1421
01:12:38.853 --> 01:12:39.924
I...

1422
01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.357
That makes me really happy
to hear you say that.

1423
01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.993
I mean. it makes me
really happy to imagine you...

1424
01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:48.401
doing that...
I can't tell you.

1425
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:52.040
I have this new passion
growing within me now

1426
01:12:52.343 --> 01:12:55.668
with working alongside unions

1427
01:12:56.003 --> 01:12:57.410
and building power

1428
01:12:57.579 --> 01:12:59.779
for working-class people
like me.

1429
01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:08.247
<i> Meanwhile. after</i>
<i>months of searching and saving.</i>

1430
01:13:08.516 --> 01:13:10.059
<i>Artemis was able</i>
<i>to find a place</i>

1431
01:13:10.228 --> 01:13:11.989
<i>within her price range.</i>

1432
01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:17.596
Before.
I was only living like a ten.

1433
01:13:17.765 --> 01:13:19.633
15-minute drive from work.
but now

1434
01:13:19.935 --> 01:13:22.230
it takes about two hours.
Or if I ride the bus...

1435
01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.133
Yeah.

1436
01:13:25.269 --> 01:13:26.607
It feels good in here.
It's light.

1437
01:13:26.776 --> 01:13:28.273
- Yeah.
- You have light.

1438
01:13:28.442 --> 01:13:29.444
Yes.

1439
01:13:29.613 --> 01:13:31.138
And you have Keanu.
which...

1440
01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.541
He's very beautiful.
he keeps me company.

1441
01:13:36.918 --> 01:13:39.080
So. when did you
start back at Disney.

1442
01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:40.919
and how are you feeling
about that now?

1443
01:13:41.787 --> 01:13:43.491
When I first got back. like.

1444
01:13:43.727 --> 01:13:45.790
it was really nice
to just be working.

1445
01:13:46.059 --> 01:13:48.761
but I've been getting
more and more frustrated

1446
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:50.630
the last couple of months
just thinking

1447
01:13:50.866 --> 01:13:53.565
about this job that was
supposed to pay my bills

1448
01:13:53.734 --> 01:13:54.800
while I focused on the things

1449
01:13:54.969 --> 01:13:56.734
that are supposed to be
what life is about.

1450
01:13:56.903 --> 01:13:58.736
about the things
that make me joy.

1451
01:13:59.172 --> 01:14:01.807
You know. I haven't focused
on any of those things

1452
01:14:01.976 --> 01:14:03.773
because I've been so focused
on the fact

1453
01:14:04.076 --> 01:14:06.873
that I couldn't survive
on this job.

1454
01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:08.441
You got a second job?

1455
01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:11.219
Yes. yes.
I got a job at a school district

1456
01:14:11.421 --> 01:14:13.116
working as a sub-custodian.

1457
01:14:13.285 --> 01:14:15.215
It's kind of a foot
in the door to potentially

1458
01:14:15.418 --> 01:14:16.955
become full-time
at a school district.

1459
01:14:17.124 --> 01:14:19.555
So. you're laying
the groundwork to leave.

1460
01:14:19.757 --> 01:14:21.559
Potentially. yeah.

1461
01:14:21.762 --> 01:14:23.565
So. is that something

1462
01:14:23.801 --> 01:14:25.966
that you've been thinking about
for a long time?

1463
01:14:28.603 --> 01:14:29.902
It's something I probably

1464
01:14:30.038 --> 01:14:31.805
should have been thinking
about for a long time.

1465
01:14:33.812 --> 01:14:36.612
<i>I had a five-year plan</i>
<i>when I went into Disney.</i>

1466
01:14:36.948 --> 01:14:39.516
<i>to be done with college</i>
<i>and onto the next thing.</i>

1467
01:14:40.781 --> 01:14:42.878
<i>And that didn't work out.</i>

1468
01:14:43.014 --> 01:14:44.785
<i>It's nine years later now.</i>

1469
01:14:47.325 --> 01:14:49.119
<i>And it's just been frustrating</i>

1470
01:14:49.287 --> 01:14:51.855
<i>because I was brought up</i>
<i>with the idea</i>

1471
01:14:52.191 --> 01:14:54.630
<i>that I'm healthy.</i>
<i>I'm intelligent.</i>

1472
01:14:54.832 --> 01:14:57.499
<i>if I put in the work.</i>
<i>I'm gonna be okay</i>

1473
01:14:57.802 --> 01:14:59.630
<i>and I'm gonna be able</i>
<i>to make money</i>

1474
01:14:59.832 --> 01:15:00.867
<i>and take care of myself.</i>

1475
01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:04.266
<i>But... I don't think</i>

1476
01:15:04.468 --> 01:15:06.842
<i>that it's as true</i>
<i>as a lot of people say.</i>

1477
01:15:22.422 --> 01:15:26.225
<i> Far and wide.</i>
<i>the reputation of Disneyland...</i>

1478
01:15:27.161 --> 01:15:32.129
<i>stands out primarily</i>
<i>for the courtesy...</i>

1479
01:15:32.964 --> 01:15:34.569
<i>and the cleanliness</i>

1480
01:15:34.838 --> 01:15:36.166
<i>and the friendliness</i>
<i>of the place.</i>

1481
01:15:39.475 --> 01:15:40.900
<i>I've always said.</i>

1482
01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:42.777
<i>in my end of the work.</i>

1483
01:15:42.979 --> 01:15:45.340
<i>that it takes people</i>
<i>to run a business.</i>

1484
01:15:47.308 --> 01:15:49.211
<i>You people have been the heart</i>

1485
01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.885
<i>and the running soul</i>
<i>of this business.</i>

1486
01:15:53.821 --> 01:15:56.593
<i>And we appreciate it no end.</i>

1487
01:16:01.829 --> 01:16:03.766
<i>And we say congratulations</i>

1488
01:16:04.035 --> 01:16:06.732
<i>to you for doing the grand job</i>
<i>that you have done.</i>

1489
01:16:06.901 --> 01:16:08.770
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1490
01:16:16.575 --> 01:16:19.473
<i> Humans are</i>
<i>meaning-making creatures.</i>

1491
01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.780
The idea of the economy

1492
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:24.280
was to give us the resources
we needed

1493
01:16:24.415 --> 01:16:25.915
so that then.
we could tell the stories

1494
01:16:26.050 --> 01:16:27.181
and build the relationships

1495
01:16:27.384 --> 01:16:29.583
and have the meaning
that we needed.

1496
01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:33.624
We've let the search
for daily bread and for things

1497
01:16:33.793 --> 01:16:36.061
completely overwhelm...

1498
01:16:37.428 --> 01:16:40.934
what our ancestors
called our "souls."

1499
01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:09.564
<i> It's really good</i>
<i>to see you guys.</i>

1500
01:17:09.767 --> 01:17:11.626
It's been a hella-long time.
huh?

1501
01:17:11.795 --> 01:17:12.965
Yeah.

1502
01:17:13.134 --> 01:17:15.230
I mean. it's been
a year and something.

1503
01:17:15.433 --> 01:17:17.371
but it feels so much longer
than that.

1504
01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:19.641
It feels like five to ten years.

1505
01:17:19.810 --> 01:17:21.310
Well. you look
like Father Time now.

1506
01:17:21.479 --> 01:17:22.843
so that works.

1507
01:17:23.012 --> 01:17:24.840
I feel more comfortable
this way.

1508
01:17:25.476 --> 01:17:28.742
So. Ralph. rumor has it
you're not going back.

1509
01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:29.917
No.

1510
01:17:31.319 --> 01:17:33.914
Tomorrow is his official
last day at the company.

1511
01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:35.189
Wow.

1512
01:17:35.825 --> 01:17:37.652
It's not
an easy decision.

1513
01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:39.586
I mean. it's...

1514
01:17:41.297 --> 01:17:44.530
it's more like moving onto
a different and new chapter

1515
01:17:44.699 --> 01:17:46.327
that'll be hopefully

1516
01:17:46.496 --> 01:17:49.005
more beneficial
for our family overall.

1517
01:17:49.507 --> 01:17:51.367
and leaving a chapter behind

1518
01:17:51.536 --> 01:17:53.404
behind that really
I'd like to forget I read.

1519
01:17:55.077 --> 01:17:57.008
I mean. there were
some highlights but...

1520
01:17:57.177 --> 01:17:59.214
Tell me
why you're leaving.

1521
01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:00.547
Um...

1522
01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:03.743
Right now. it's...
I'm getting at that age.

1523
01:18:03.911 --> 01:18:06.222
it's wearing on me.
it's a lot of physical work

1524
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:07.689
that we were doing

1525
01:18:07.858 --> 01:18:09.721
for not a lot
of financial reward.

1526
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:11.552
and that's taken its toll.

1527
01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.396
So. what's next?

1528
01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:16.832
What are your options?

1529
01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:21.529
See. uh. where life takes us.

1530
01:18:24.839 --> 01:18:26.031
Happy birthday. Dad!

1531
01:18:28.309 --> 01:18:30.205
- Happy birthday. baby.
- Thank you. Daddy.

1532
01:18:30.541 --> 01:18:32.042
'Cause I know you
get everything good

1533
01:18:32.211 --> 01:18:34.541
when this happens.
you get cake...

1534
01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:36.711
- Yes.
- Yes.

1535
01:18:37.714 --> 01:18:39.379
Oh. those can't be for me.
that's much too old.

1536
01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.447
- Happy birthday.

1537
01:18:41.682 --> 01:18:43.386
- Yes.
- Surprise.

1538
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.288
All right. here we go.

1539
01:18:46.491 --> 01:18:48.123
we're all gonna try
to block the wind.

1540
01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:57.802
<i> If you</i>
<i>could tell Disney anything.</i>

1541
01:18:58.005 --> 01:18:59.567
<i>what would you tell them?</i>

1542
01:19:01.912 --> 01:19:04.040
We'd like to be able
to have a home.

1543
01:19:11.722 --> 01:19:12.986
Got a little help there. huh?

1544
01:19:13.121 --> 01:19:14.687
- Who wants one first?
- I want cake!

1545
01:19:14.889 --> 01:19:16.421
- Me!
- Me!

1546
01:19:16.557 --> 01:19:17.525
Me!

1547
01:19:17.661 --> 01:19:19.018
Is that good cake?

1548
01:19:19.153 --> 01:19:20.324
Yeah?

1549
01:19:29.563 --> 01:19:31.166
Come back here!

1550
01:19:31.568 --> 01:19:35.042
One. two. go. Daddy.
get 'em!

1551
01:19:35.742 --> 01:19:37.036
Ahh!

1552
01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.344
Whoo!

1553
01:19:43.918 --> 01:19:46.213
Woo. that was tough. Mom!

1554
01:19:46.415 --> 01:19:47.824
Let's go.

1555
01:20:07.272 --> 01:20:09.071
<i> "Dear Bobs...</i>

1556
01:20:09.273 --> 01:20:11.069
<i>"Yeah. this is for both of you.</i>

1557
01:20:11.338 --> 01:20:12.573
<i>Bob Iger</i>

1558
01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:15.408
<i>and Disney's new CEO.</i>
<i>Bob Chapek."</i>

1559
01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:18.211
<i>"You didn't seem to</i>
<i>understand my email.</i>

1560
01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.120
<i>so I made this film."</i>

1561
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:22.651
<i>"This is for you</i>

1562
01:20:22.787 --> 01:20:25.157
<i>and for all the Toms.</i>
<i>Dicks. Harrys. and Marys</i>

1563
01:20:25.426 --> 01:20:27.661
<i>running Wall Street</i>
<i>and corporate America.</i>

1564
01:20:28.330 --> 01:20:31.194
<i>because this isn't</i>
<i>just a Disney story.</i>

1565
01:20:31.796 --> 01:20:35.229
<i>it's the story of nearly half</i>
<i>of American full-time workers</i>

1566
01:20:35.465 --> 01:20:37.469
<i>who can't make ends meet."</i>

1567
01:20:38.639 --> 01:20:41.707
<i>"These problems are the result</i>
<i>of a complicated system</i>

1568
01:20:41.976 --> 01:20:44.078
<i>that constrains us all."</i>

1569
01:20:45.343 --> 01:20:47.315
<i>"It may not be our fault.</i>

1570
01:20:47.784 --> 01:20:50.150
<i>but it is our responsibility.</i>

1571
01:20:51.282 --> 01:20:53.052
<i>and you and I both know</i>

1572
01:20:53.321 --> 01:20:54.884
<i>that with imagination</i>
<i>and courage.</i>

1573
01:20:55.187 --> 01:20:56.684
<i>it can be changed."</i>

1574
01:20:59.624 --> 01:21:02.063
<i>"Maybe I sound</i>
<i>a little too Disney.</i>

1575
01:21:02.830 --> 01:21:04.066
<i>but trust me.</i>

1576
01:21:04.535 --> 01:21:06.166
<i>I'm not alone."</i>

1577
01:21:08.067 --> 01:21:09.428
<i>"To be continued."</i>
