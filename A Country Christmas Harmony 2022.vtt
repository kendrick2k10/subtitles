Welcome back to
the Christmas Song Countdown

Official YIFY movies site:

4
00:00:09.593 --> 00:00:12.177
where we're reviewing all
the latest Christmas singles

5
00:00:12.263 --> 00:00:14.013
from some of
your favorite artists.

6
00:00:14.098 --> 00:00:16.682
I'm your ho-ho host.
Leslie Manalo.

7
00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.684
letting you know
which songs made the nice list

8
00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.686
and which songs did not.

9
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.305
Just this week. Chrissy Kessler
dropped her latest single.

10
00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.733
Reindeer Slaay.
in advance of her upcoming

11
00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:27.526
live TV Christmas concert.

12
00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:29.978
But unfortunately for Kessler.
her new single

13
00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:32.823
finds itself at the top
of our naughty list.

14
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.034
Hard to believe. right? I know.

15
00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:36.618
Well. don't take my word
for it.

16
00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:38.746
Here's a clip
from the Reindeer Slaay

17
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:41.040
music video. Take a look.

18
00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:34.593
Ooh. naughty. naughty. naughty.

19
00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:36.720
Typically known
for her soulful vocals.

20
00:01:36.847 --> 00:01:39.598
Kessler has instead decided
to dive head-first

21
00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:41.934
into the world
of over-produced pop.

22
00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:43.936
Now. while that style works
for other artists.

23
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:47.055
it fits Kessler like a Santa
Suit fits a Christmas gnome.

24
00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.233
-Someone call Rudolph.
-Oh. how about that?

25
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.443
'Cause Santa is not coming
to town.

26
00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:54.655
Time to jingle
all the way out.

27
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.365
That was your last warning.
Chrissy.

28
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.241
If you watch anymore coverage
on Reindeer Slaay.

29
00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.068
I'm putting you in a time-out.

30
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:01.870
At this point. a time-out sounds

31
00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:03.580
like a nice break
from real life.

32
00:02:03.707 --> 00:02:06.458
I'm serious. honey.

33
00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:10.169
Okay. Eugene.
I promise. TV stays off.

34
00:02:16.554 --> 00:02:17.845
Why?

35
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.255
And that includes
staying off all social.

36
00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.756
or looking up any articles.

37
00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:24.426
What? I was texting
my manicurist.

38
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.478
I've been making all of your
appointments for the past

39
00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:29.022
ten years. you wouldn't know
your manicurist's number

40
00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:31.150
if it came screaming down
your chimney on Christmas Eve.

41
00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:33.101
-All right.
-Oh. speaking of appointments.

42
00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.270
We have to be at your manager's
office in 30 minutes.

43
00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:36.938
Oh. right.

44
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:39.908
If anyone can fix this
nightmare release. it's Carole.

45
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:44.779
Do you mind if I give you
a little tough love.

46
00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:47.708
my beautiful. amazing.
best friend in the entire world?

47
00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:49.784
Oh. dear. if you're already
buttering me up.

48
00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.506
this is gonna be bad. Okay. Go.

49
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.841
Don't get your hopes up.
Carole is good.

50
00:02:56.927 --> 00:03:00.429
but what you need
is a Christmas miracle.

51
00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.967
Well. then I guess it's a good
thing I believe in miracles.

52
00:03:09.273 --> 00:03:12.024
-You have my water. right?
-And my earphones. your purse.

53
00:03:21.118 --> 00:03:25.662
-Thank you.
-Is that my favorite client?

54
00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.040
Good to see you. my dear.
Right this way.

55
00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.958
We've no time to waste.

56
00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:34.004
Well. first of all
I just wanna say thank you

57
00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:36.006
for scrambling to come up
with a plan.

58
00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.258
And I'm very excited to hear it.

59
00:03:38.344 --> 00:03:43.013
But I've also been doing a lot
of thinking about everything.

60
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.173
When I was first starting out.

61
00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:47.841
I felt good knowing
that I was doing

62
00:03:47.937 --> 00:03:50.603
everything I could
to chase my dreams.

63
00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.651
But lately it just feels like
I'm chasing trends.

64
00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:59.020
And I just wanna get back
to the real me.

65
00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:02.524
And that's precisely
what we're going to do.

66
00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:05.285
You. my dear.
have an opportunity

67
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:07.955
to turn everything around
with your upcoming

68
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.207
televised Christmas concert.

69
00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:14.703
First. the label would like
to cut bait on Reindeer Slaay.

70
00:04:14.797 --> 00:04:17.380
Instead. you're going to debut

71
00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.716
a brand-new single live on-air.

72
00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:22.928
We've reached out to several
writers and they're coming up

73
00:04:23.013 --> 00:04:24.805
with brand-new songs
as we speak.

74
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.102
Okay. Um. what if I don't hear
anything that I like?

75
00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:33.981
Maybe I should try
and write something.

76
00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:36.608
I mean. I know it's been a while
since I've written my own stuff.

77
00:04:36.694 --> 00:04:40.228
You can certainly try.
but we can't count on that.

78
00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:43.573
You're gonna be very busy
rehearsing for the concert.

79
00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:45.400
Okay. Sure.

80
00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:48.120
And thankfully we only
have the one original song

81
00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:49.579
to try and figure out.

82
00:04:49.707 --> 00:04:50.905
For the rest of the concert.

83
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.249
we were thinking you'd perform

84
00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:53.792
songs from your
last Christmas album.

85
00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:55.744
That's a great idea.

86
00:04:55.838 --> 00:04:58.630
Those songs.
they really had heart.

87
00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:00.549
I couldn't agree more.

88
00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:04.011
And from the heart is exactly
what this concert needs.

89
00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:06.588
which is why
this next piece of the plan

90
00:05:06.682 --> 00:05:08.765
is the most important part.

91
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.645
Chrissy Kessler.
Home For The Holidays.

92
00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:16.273
The label. the network and I
have come up

93
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.400
with the idea
to re-brand the concert

94
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:22.070
in an effort
to rehabilitate your image.

95
00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:24.239
Instead of performing
in Nashville at a big arena.

96
00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:27.284
you'll be performing in front
of friends and family.

97
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:29.828
live from your hometown
of Cedar Pines.

98
00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:33.665
-Oh. No. No. no.
-No. no.

99
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:35.292
-I'm sorry. No. I can't.
-Just wait. Chrissy.

100
00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.210
-Hear me. hear me out.
-Y-you-you don't understand.

101
00:05:37.296 --> 00:05:39.287
-Just hear me out.
-No. you just don't understand.

102
00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:44.176
Okay? I-I don't have any family
or friends left there.

103
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.553
I haven't been back home
since I left for Nashville

104
00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:48.680
ten years ago.

105
00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:52.142
I would really. really like to
keep my past where it belongs.

106
00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:55.479
-I understand. I really do.
-Okay.

107
00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:57.522
And if you don't wanna go.
you don't have to.

108
00:05:57.608 --> 00:05:59.816
Okay. Okay.

109
00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:04.145
But if I'm being honest.
I'm really worried. Chrissy.

110
00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:05.814
The label isn't happy.

111
00:06:05.908 --> 00:06:08.700
And if this concert
doesn't go well.

112
00:06:08.786 --> 00:06:12.037
I'm afraid they might drop you.

113
00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:15.290
I'm sorry. honey.
but that's the truth.

114
00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:19.661
You really think
this plan will work?

115
00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:21.380
I really do.

116
00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:24.299
Okay.

117
00:06:26.387 --> 00:06:28.053
-I'll go.
-Hm.

118
00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.846
You'll both leave tonight.

119
00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.890
Your tickets
have already been purchased.

120
00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:36.186
And try not to be so worried.
This is gonna work.

121
00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.688
Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:06:40.109 --> 00:06:43.193
Um. where did she say
we were going?

123
00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.607
Home. sweet home.

124
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:39.916
I'm so sorry. babe.
I really thought we'd get

125
00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:41.960
to spend Christmas together
this year.

126
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:43.745
Stop apologizing.
if it's not you

127
00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:46.414
that has to leave for work.
it's me.

128
00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:50.594
But after five years
of spending the holidays apart.

129
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:53.346
I think we've perfected
the FaceTime Christmas.

130
00:07:53.432 --> 00:07:54.848
You sure you can't fly out?

131
00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.425
No. I wish.
but I gotta work. too.

132
00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.394
You know I'd be there in a
heartbeat if I could take off.

133
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.062
-I know.
-I love you.

134
00:08:05.235 --> 00:08:08.320
I'm really sorry. I know how
much you were looking forward

135
00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:10.271
to spending Christmas together
this year.

136
00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:13.783
Mm. I'll be okay.

137
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:17.537
But what about you?
How do you feel being home?

138
00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:20.782
I can tell you're nervous

139
00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:23.168
because you're doing
the water thing.

140
00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.286
-What water thing?
-The same water thing you do.

141
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.755
Every time you get nervous.

142
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.174
You've been sipping that
non-stop.

143
00:08:30.636 --> 00:08:32.460
Uh-huh.

144
00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:34.763
I have avoided this place
for the last decade.

145
00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:36.631
What was I thinking
agreeing to come back?

146
00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:39.683
Decade? When did your parents
move away again?

147
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.803
They retired to Key West
almost immediately

148
00:08:41.897 --> 00:08:44.481
after I left for Nashville.
They're so funny.

149
00:08:44.608 --> 00:08:47.192
My mom started calling herself
Key Lime Kathy.

150
00:08:49.238 --> 00:08:53.114
Okay. so your parents
don't live here. but...

151
00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:55.149
But what?

152
00:08:55.244 --> 00:08:57.652
Come on.
The guy you left behind?

153
00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:01.155
You know. broke up
with him on Christmas morning.

154
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.542
in a letter. before running away
to Nashville.

155
00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:04.960
Any of this ring a bell?

156
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.327
Why do you know
everything about my life?

157
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.963
Because you tell me everything

158
00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.548
about your life.

159
00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:11.383
-It's true.
-So?

160
00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:13.668
Does this man still live here?

161
00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:17.171
The man's name is Luke.
and I wouldn't know.

162
00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:19.933
We haven't spoken since I left.

163
00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:21.393
And I'd really like
to keep it that way.

164
00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:22.978
So if you happen to
see him around town

165
00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:25.063
somewhere. please warn me.

166
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:27.899
Oh. how? I don't even know
what he looks like.

167
00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:33.572
You know. 6'2.
eyes that light up a room

168
00:09:33.657 --> 00:09:35.189
and a jawline so sharp.

169
00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:38.076
you could chop down
Christmas trees with it.

170
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:40.495
Wow. okay.

171
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:47.210
We need to find somewhere
with a bathroom. Quick!

172
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:53.091
All right. see you. Thanks.
Have a good night.

173
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.887
So. grandma. you being helpful
over there or just a pain?

174
00:09:58.015 --> 00:10:02.934
Oh. look. someone left their
number for you on their receipt.

175
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.220
-So a pain. then.
-But this one looks nice.

176
00:10:06.315 --> 00:10:07.897
I mean. she took the time
to draw

177
00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:10.275
a little happy face
and everything.

178
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.987
You're impossible.

179
00:10:14.072 --> 00:10:17.699
Oh. the last thing I need
right now is a girlfriend.

180
00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.076
Oh. you can say that
till you're blue in the face.

181
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:23.571
but it doesn't mean it's true.

182
00:10:23.665 --> 00:10:26.333
When was the last time
you went out on a date. anyhow?

183
00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:28.409
Had to be right before
your sister passed.

184
00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:31.046
-Grandma. please.
-Oh. I'm sorry.

185
00:10:31.131 --> 00:10:33.247
I know it's uncomfortable.

186
00:10:33.342 --> 00:10:36.384
But I think this is something
that you need to hear.

187
00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.421
Look at me. Luke.

188
00:10:40.515 --> 00:10:43.091
Now. your sister
was a fine girl.

189
00:10:43.185 --> 00:10:46.519
I've never known a sweeter woman
in my whole life.

190
00:10:46.605 --> 00:10:49.272
And what happened to her
wasn't fair.

191
00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:54.152
First her husband walks out.
then the accident.

192
00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:57.947
But what you did.
deciding to take over this bar.

193
00:10:58.075 --> 00:11:00.367
keep her legacy alive.

194
00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:03.444
then stepping up
to raise her boy.

195
00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:08.282
Well. I never knew really
what faith was until I saw that.

196
00:11:08.377 --> 00:11:11.628
But Brandon
is ten years old now.

197
00:11:11.755 --> 00:11:15.965
I know he'd understand
if. if you found a lady.

198
00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:18.134
How can you be so sure?

199
00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:21.304
I mean...

200
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:25.392
What if I meet someone
and he doesn't like her?

201
00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:27.301
I feel like
something like that could.

202
00:11:27.396 --> 00:11:28.970
could really mess a kid up.

203
00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:32.315
Or he could fall in love
with her. same as you.

204
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:42.826
Like I said. last thing I need
right now is a distraction.

205
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.800
Ooh. Oh!

206
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.762
Oh.

207
00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:18.186
So sorry to just
run in here like that.

208
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:22.657
But seriously.
you saved me from a disaster.

209
00:12:26.872 --> 00:12:29.456
-Chrissy?
-Luke.

210
00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:34.711
What is taking her so long?

211
00:12:36.214 --> 00:12:38.047
Six-foot-two.
eyes that light up a room.

212
00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:40.708
a jawline that could chop down
a Christmas tree.

213
00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:42.927
Oh. no. This isn't good.

214
00:12:48.518 --> 00:12:50.769
Okay. enough with the theatrics.

215
00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:52.887
You'd think
the ghost of Marilyn Monroe

216
00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.647
just walked in
looking for a stiff one.

217
00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:56.357
Oh. my goodness. Pearl.

218
00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.392
I-I didn't even see you
standing there.

219
00:12:58.487 --> 00:13:00.278
-Of course you didn't.
-Hi.

220
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.899
Oh. Well. I know her.
but I don't know you.

221
00:13:04.993 --> 00:13:06.901
Oh. I'm sorry.
I should have introduced myself.

222
00:13:06.995 --> 00:13:08.411
I'm Eugene. Chrissy's assistant.

223
00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.404
Oh. no need to apologize.

224
00:13:10.499 --> 00:13:13.249
It's quite the shock
for everybody.

225
00:13:13.376 --> 00:13:16.920
I'm Pearl. and that there
is my grandson. Luke.

226
00:13:17.047 --> 00:13:20.673
-Hi.
-Oh. It's good to see you. kid.

227
00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:24.085
-Oh. you look great.
-Oh!

228
00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:28.264
No! I look like a little
old lady who dyes her hair red.

229
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:30.391
No.
You look great.

230
00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:33.311
Oh. stop it.
You're gonna make me blush.

231
00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:37.357
So. brings you back here?

232
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:41.653
Hello to you. too.

233
00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:44.906
Home For The Holidays.

234
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.441
So you're back here
for Christmas or...

235
00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:50.370
Yeah. I mean.
that is the big night.

236
00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:53.915
Isn't that lovely?

237
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.617
What's it been?
Ten years and some change?

238
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:57.877
I bet Chrissy doesn't even know

239
00:13:57.963 --> 00:13:59.879
you're running
your own restaurant.

240
00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:01.339
Why don't you bring her here
for dinner?

241
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:05.134
Show off that prize-winning menu
of yours.

242
00:14:05.262 --> 00:14:07.512
Say. isn't tomorrow
your day off?

243
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:10.798
Ah. y-yes. it is.
but I-I actually can't--

244
00:14:10.892 --> 00:14:13.351
Well. I can't tomorrow.
actually. because I'm busy.

245
00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:15.854
-Well. I'm busy too. so I can't.
-Oh. you're busy?

246
00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:17.981
-Yeah. can't do it.
-What do you mean you can't?

247
00:14:18.108 --> 00:14:20.308
I have more of a social life
than you. and by more.

248
00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.652
I mean. I actually have one.

249
00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:26.322
-Chrissy. honey.
-Yes.

250
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.157
You've been gone a long time.

251
00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:30.201
Some things around here
haven't changed.

252
00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:32.036
What I say still goes.

253
00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:35.665
So you are having dinner
with my grandson.

254
00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.667
and that's all there is to it.

255
00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:39.168
Yes. ma'am.

256
00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.557
-Okay. Thoughts?
-I like it.

257
00:14:52.642 --> 00:14:55.852
What? It's so boring!

258
00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:58.438
Like. I thought
the striped one was boring.

259
00:14:58.523 --> 00:15:01.015
but this one's so boring.
I just fell asleep looking at it

260
00:15:01.109 --> 00:15:04.110
while describing its insane
level of boringness.

261
00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.862
-Brandon!
-I'm sorry.

262
00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:09.490
But yesterday I didn't even know
you knew Chrissy Kessler.

263
00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:12.526
No wonder you play her music
all the time.

264
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.287
Is that so?

265
00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:16.364
I wouldn't say
it's all the time.

266
00:15:16.458 --> 00:15:18.958
No. he does. and then tonight

267
00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:21.002
not only did I find out
that you know her.

268
00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:24.839
but Grandma Pearl tells me that
you're going on a date with her.

269
00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:29.010
So it's obviously
the coolest thing ever.

270
00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:31.212
But that tie
still doesn't work.

271
00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:33.264
and you really
can't wear it. so...

272
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.059
Tough crowd. Okay. fine.

273
00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.311
And why are you telling him
I'm going on a date?

274
00:15:38.396 --> 00:15:39.938
Isn't it a date?

275
00:15:40.023 --> 00:15:41.889
Did you just answer my question
with a question?

276
00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:46.235
Did you just answer my question
with a question?

277
00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:48.729
Okay. first of all.
it's not a date.

278
00:15:48.823 --> 00:15:50.564
And second of all.
the only reason I'm going

279
00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:52.659
is because you're making me.

280
00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:58.247
Oh. I'm out of ties.

281
00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.749
I know.

282
00:16:01.878 --> 00:16:03.252
Do you...

283
00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:13.087
Oh. wow!
That right there is a tie.

284
00:16:13.181 --> 00:16:14.922
Where. where did you
get this from?

285
00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:18.893
I bought it with my allowance.
It was worth every cent.

286
00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:22.230
Okay. Wow. Then...

287
00:16:22.315 --> 00:16:24.932
-You have to wear it.
-I probably should wear it.

288
00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:27.694
I mean. you bought it.
Bring it over here.

289
00:16:27.779 --> 00:16:30.905
Let's try it on. Thank you.

290
00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.323
This one off.

291
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.279
Hi. guys.
so while I'm back home.

292
00:16:38.373 --> 00:16:40.707
I thought I would show you
a little bit of the town

293
00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:42.792
that I grew up in.

294
00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:45.953
This right here
is my favorite spot in town.

295
00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.381
Great food. better drinks.

296
00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.258
And whenever I come back
for a visit.

297
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:52.626
I will not leave
until I come here

298
00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:54.971
to check out the local talent
and. you know.

299
00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:58.266
knock back a few
with a couple of old friends.

300
00:16:58.351 --> 00:16:59.809
-Is that right?
-Hi.

301
00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.477
Oh. We'll just
pick this up later.

302
00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:05.356
-Got it. Have fun!
-Um. sorry about that.

303
00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:08.734
I just promised my team that
I would post as much as possible

304
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.028
while I'm in town.

305
00:17:10.113 --> 00:17:11.654
It's alright.

306
00:17:21.124 --> 00:17:24.751
Oh. gosh. Oh. God.

307
00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:27.795
Gosh.

308
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.715
Sorry.

309
00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:37.305
So. here we are.

310
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.839
-Yup.
-Yeah. this is strange.

311
00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:40.767
-Yeah. it's... Yeah. extremely.
-Isn't it?

312
00:17:40.852 --> 00:17:42.060
Yeah.

313
00:17:42.854 --> 00:17:44.604
Um...

314
00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.564
Oh. you don't. you don't need
to worry about that. I already

315
00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:49.650
told the boys in the back
what to bring out to the table.

316
00:17:51.613 --> 00:17:53.404
How do you know what I want?

317
00:17:55.492 --> 00:17:57.533
Hm. Yeah. You're right.

318
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.119
Never could figure out
what you wanted.

319
00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:03.331
I meant what I wanted to eat.

320
00:18:05.835 --> 00:18:07.168
Thanks. buddy.

321
00:18:09.422 --> 00:18:12.256
You know what. if we're gonna
have dinner together.

322
00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.208
can we at least
try and be civil?

323
00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:16.544
It's been ten years. Luke.

324
00:18:16.638 --> 00:18:19.430
Maybe it would be nice
to just. just catch up

325
00:18:19.516 --> 00:18:21.599
without butting heads.

326
00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.312
I was being rude.

327
00:18:28.858 --> 00:18:30.858
Can we just start again?

328
00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:34.987
Well. it sounds like a plan.

329
00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:42.903
Okay.
Okay. okay.

330
00:18:42.997 --> 00:18:47.041
-You said that? What?
-Do you remember...

331
00:18:47.127 --> 00:18:50.336
Do you remember this one. the
show we did in that little bar

332
00:18:50.421 --> 00:18:52.746
way out in. like.
Jackson County?

333
00:18:52.841 --> 00:18:56.968
Well. like. what. three people
showed up? Maybe four?

334
00:18:57.053 --> 00:19:00.421
Yeah. Yeah. I... Ah.

335
00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:02.807
You remember the guy
with the pig?

336
00:19:02.892 --> 00:19:05.434
-You remember that?
-The pig!

337
00:19:05.562 --> 00:19:08.104
Oh. my gosh.
I forgot about the pig.

338
00:19:08.231 --> 00:19:10.264
You almost got punched
that night.

339
00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:13.234
Ah. well. yeah. I guess
I probably shouldn't have said

340
00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:17.446
we accept
all tips including bacon.

341
00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:23.494
You didn't have my back.
by the way.

342
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.998
-What was I supposed to do?
-I don't know.

343
00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.000
I would've sold you out
in a hot second.

344
00:19:29.085 --> 00:19:30.710
Man...

345
00:19:30.795 --> 00:19:35.289
Oh. Wow. It. this is so...

346
00:19:35.383 --> 00:19:40.219
It's-it's just weird to think
that all we had back then

347
00:19:40.305 --> 00:19:44.182
were some crappy used guitars
and a couple of.

348
00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:46.517
couple of picks I stole
from the school band room.

349
00:19:46.603 --> 00:19:48.519
Why anyone would wanna
come out and hear

350
00:19:48.605 --> 00:19:52.481
two very amateur singers
who are just starting out?

351
00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:56.527
Oh. you can just stop
with the false modesty.

352
00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:57.987
-No...
-Ah.

353
00:19:58.114 --> 00:20:01.315
People came to hear
you sing. Yeah.

354
00:20:01.409 --> 00:20:04.994
Well. don't sell
yourself short. Luke.

355
00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.987
I mean.
maybe I had the better voice.

356
00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:08.989
Just a. just a little bit.

357
00:20:09.083 --> 00:20:11.209
You know. but the songs
I wrote for myself

358
00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:13.827
were never as good
as the ones you wrote for me.

359
00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:16.505
And all anybody could talk
about back then

360
00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:21.510
was the magic you were making
with that guitar.

361
00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:25.681
Yeah. well.
not anymore. they're not.

362
00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:27.675
These days the only thing
I'm famous for around here

363
00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.227
are my ribs.

364
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.563
Well. that's a shame.

365
00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:37.485
No. No. it's. it's fine.

366
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.687
Really. Yeah.

367
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:41.188
You know.
all those years on the road.

368
00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.532
I. I just realized

369
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.860
that having a place to call home

370
00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:49.288
was more important to me
than music was.

371
00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:54.702
Home is right here
in Cedar Pines.

372
00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:58.047
So I guess we. uh.
I guess we both

373
00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:00.216
kinda got what we wanted. right?

374
00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.428
I guess we did.

375
00:21:12.105 --> 00:21:13.604
Yeah.

376
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.855
Okay. well. I gotta ask.

377
00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:17.066
Who is the girl?

378
00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.610
The. the what?

379
00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:21.395
Oh. come on.

380
00:21:21.489 --> 00:21:25.232
I know that you did not pick out
that awful tie all on your own.

381
00:21:25.326 --> 00:21:27.243
-This tie? Right.
-It's terrible.

382
00:21:28.705 --> 00:21:30.538
You are right.
I did not pick this out.

383
00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:32.039
-Um...
-Yeah.

384
00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:35.084
Uh. yeah. Brandon.
Brandon picked this out.

385
00:21:35.211 --> 00:21:37.962
-My nephew.
-That's funny.

386
00:21:39.674 --> 00:21:43.926
Yeah. Um. uh...

387
00:21:44.053 --> 00:21:47.263
My sister. uh. she actually. um.

388
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.474
she passed away a couple
of years after you left.

389
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:55.187
And so I. uh. I adopted him
as soon as I could.

390
00:21:56.399 --> 00:21:57.982
I had no idea.

391
00:21:59.235 --> 00:22:01.068
Luke. I'm so sorry.

392
00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:06.949
Um. if it's okay with you.

393
00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:11.037
I would really love to meet
Brandon.

394
00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:13.914
I'm sure we can. uh. figure
something out.

395
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.949
Okay.

396
00:22:16.044 --> 00:22:18.169
Oh. you should bring him
to the concert.

397
00:22:19.922 --> 00:22:22.623
Uh. w-w-what concert?

398
00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:26.218
I told you last night.
Home For The Holidays.

399
00:22:26.304 --> 00:22:30.130
I came home to do
a live Christmas concert

400
00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:32.466
from back where it all began.

401
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.686
Chrissy Kessler.
Home For The Holidays.

402
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.442
-Right.
-Yeah.

403
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:44.737
What?

404
00:22:44.822 --> 00:22:47.698
Here I thought
that you came back

405
00:22:47.784 --> 00:22:50.493
because you actually missed
this place.

406
00:22:53.331 --> 00:22:57.291
This whole thing
is just a big publicity stunt.

407
00:22:57.377 --> 00:23:00.753
-Isn't it? Really?
-No. It's not. Really.

408
00:23:00.838 --> 00:23:03.214
Well. then. then what was
that crap you were saying when

409
00:23:03.299 --> 00:23:05.841
I walked in here. about how this
was your favorite restaurant.

410
00:23:05.968 --> 00:23:07.551
you know. and you liked to come
and catch up

411
00:23:07.637 --> 00:23:08.677
with old friends or whatever?

412
00:23:08.805 --> 00:23:10.838
Because we both know

413
00:23:10.932 --> 00:23:12.306
you've never been
to this restaurant.

414
00:23:12.392 --> 00:23:13.674
because my sister
bought this place

415
00:23:13.768 --> 00:23:16.185
a couple of months
after you left.

416
00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:18.437
I...

417
00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:23.359
You. you're this big star.
Chrissy.

418
00:23:23.486 --> 00:23:26.570
There isn't an ounce
of authenticity left in you.

419
00:23:26.656 --> 00:23:29.698
I mean. because when I knew you.
there wasn't a dirt road

420
00:23:29.826 --> 00:23:34.286
in this entire town
you didn't know.

421
00:23:34.372 --> 00:23:36.956
I bet you couldn't even find it
on a map.

422
00:23:41.671 --> 00:23:43.170
Exactly.

423
00:23:44.841 --> 00:23:47.207
You know. you shouldn't be
calling your concert

424
00:23:47.301 --> 00:23:49.343
Home For The Holidays

425
00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:52.546
when you don't even know
what that word means anymore.

426
00:24:08.406 --> 00:24:09.947
How on Earth
am I gonna write this?

427
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.663
Hi. Carole. Hi.

428
00:24:17.748 --> 00:24:20.916
Have you had a chance to listen
to any of the demos I sent?

429
00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:23.335
I did. Uh. yeah.
I listened to all of 'em.

430
00:24:23.421 --> 00:24:26.964
I-I don't know. It's just. none
of 'em really felt right to me.

431
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:29.249
Oh. Don't worry.
We'll find something.

432
00:24:29.343 --> 00:24:32.085
All right. yeah. Is that all?

433
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.763
No. I had an idea.

434
00:24:34.891 --> 00:24:37.641
And I need you to hear me out
before shooting it down. okay?

435
00:24:37.727 --> 00:24:40.811
-Oh. I'm already nervous.
-Nothing to be nervous about.

436
00:24:40.897 --> 00:24:43.439
Your publicist and I
have been chatting.

437
00:24:43.566 --> 00:24:46.817
and we were thinking how much
amazing press you'd get

438
00:24:46.903 --> 00:24:50.437
if you reunited with Brad Love
at your concert.

439
00:24:50.531 --> 00:24:54.617
-No. No way.
-Now. wait. hear me out.

440
00:24:54.744 --> 00:24:56.452
What if you guys
did a duet together?

441
00:24:56.579 --> 00:24:58.579
Maybe sing a classic
Christmas song together.

442
00:24:58.664 --> 00:25:02.583
No. no. no. no.
Brad and I are through.

443
00:25:02.668 --> 00:25:05.336
And I don't care how good the
publicity is. it's not worth

444
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:07.454
getting back together
with your ex.

445
00:25:07.548 --> 00:25:09.131
I've had all I can take
of ex-boyfriends.

446
00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:12.292
-What's that?
-Ah. uh. nothing. What?

447
00:25:12.386 --> 00:25:15.638
Anyway. I don't know
why you think Brad is so awful.

448
00:25:15.765 --> 00:25:17.973
I'm not just saying thisbecause you're both my clients.

449
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.143
but you guys
were really good together.

450
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.729
Honestly. I don't even remember
why you all broke up.

451
00:25:23.814 --> 00:25:25.940
Well. I-I never said
he was awful.

452
00:25:26.025 --> 00:25:28.317
We broke up because
Brad Love puts Brad Love first.

453
00:25:28.444 --> 00:25:31.320
All right. all right. I'll drop
the Brad thing for now.

454
00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:33.906
No. no. Not-not for now.
For always.

455
00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:35.649
Mm. maybe you'll change
your mind.

456
00:25:35.743 --> 00:25:38.151
-Nope. Never gonna happen.
-Never know.

457
00:25:38.246 --> 00:25:41.413
-Okay. Buh-bye. Carole.
-Chat soon. Chrissy.

458
00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:50.589
-You seem kinda worked up today.
-Yeah. I am!

459
00:25:50.675 --> 00:25:52.049
Carole called this morning
trying to get me

460
00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:54.001
back together with my ex.

461
00:25:54.095 --> 00:25:56.003
which is the last thing I need
after last night's dinner

462
00:25:56.097 --> 00:25:59.557
with Luke. who basically told me
he thinks I'm a total fake.

463
00:25:59.642 --> 00:26:02.101
and then stormed out
of his own restaurant.

464
00:26:02.186 --> 00:26:05.271
And now I'm marching through
Cedar Pines. my hometown.

465
00:26:05.356 --> 00:26:07.231
that I haven't been back to
in ten years.

466
00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:10.317
and honestly.
it's all a little stressful.

467
00:26:10.403 --> 00:26:13.020
And that's why
I have to buy that bicycle.

468
00:26:13.114 --> 00:26:15.698
-I'm sorry. What?
-Because of Luke.

469
00:26:15.825 --> 00:26:18.576
Huh? You're scaring me.

470
00:26:18.661 --> 00:26:21.745
Luke said that I didn't know
this town anymore.

471
00:26:21.831 --> 00:26:23.747
Probably couldn't even find it
on a map.

472
00:26:23.833 --> 00:26:26.584
or something like that.
Well. I'm gonna show him.

473
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:29.202
I'm gonna get a bike
and I'm gonna ride it

474
00:26:29.297 --> 00:26:31.338
down the dirt roads
that I was raised on.

475
00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:32.756
-Makes sense now?
-Yeah.

476
00:26:32.842 --> 00:26:35.042
When you explain it with
a complete set of words

477
00:26:35.136 --> 00:26:37.052
and then put those words
in a specific context.

478
00:26:37.179 --> 00:26:38.262
it makes perfect sense.

479
00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:39.722
No. not fair. you're not

480
00:26:39.849 --> 00:26:42.049
allowed to make me laugh
when I'm upset.

481
00:26:42.143 --> 00:26:43.892
Too bad.

482
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.555
Look. I know what Luke said
was hard to hear.

483
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:52.401
-But maybe he was right.
-What does that mean?

484
00:26:52.528 --> 00:26:54.486
You haven't been back
in ten years.

485
00:26:54.572 --> 00:26:56.229
Maybe you don't remember
this place as well

486
00:26:56.324 --> 00:26:58.065
as you think you do.

487
00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:00.701
And I know it was hard for you
to come back.

488
00:27:00.786 --> 00:27:02.069
But did you ever consider

489
00:27:02.163 --> 00:27:04.955
that this isn't so easy
for Luke either?

490
00:27:07.043 --> 00:27:10.711
No. I didn't. Thank you. Eugene.

491
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:21.305
Is this hat on too tight.
or is that Chrissy Kessler?

492
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:24.933
Bruce! Ah!

493
00:27:25.061 --> 00:27:28.646
-Hi! How are you? Oh.
-Wonderful!

494
00:27:28.731 --> 00:27:30.606
Oh. shoot.
I always knew you'd come home.

495
00:27:30.733 --> 00:27:33.776
-And isn't a second too soon.
-Oh. my goodness!

496
00:27:33.903 --> 00:27:36.570
-I have missed you. Bruce.
-I missed you. too.

497
00:27:36.656 --> 00:27:40.115
Oh. unbelievable. I was just
coming by to buy a bike

498
00:27:40.242 --> 00:27:41.825
and ride around town today.

499
00:27:41.911 --> 00:27:43.276
No. you're not buying anything.

500
00:27:43.371 --> 00:27:44.495
We'll find something
for you to ride.

501
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.946
Just bring it back in one piece.

502
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.040
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm. Absolutely.

503
00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:51.543
-Wouldn't have it any other way.
-Thank you.

504
00:27:51.629 --> 00:27:55.130
Uh. Chrissy.
I think you have a stalker.

505
00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:58.801
Oh. no.
This is my assistant. Eugene.

506
00:27:58.928 --> 00:28:00.803
Oh. It's a pleasure to meet you.

507
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:01.962
And you as well.

508
00:28:02.056 --> 00:28:03.263
I've known this young lady since

509
00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:05.057
she was knee-high
to a grasshopper.

510
00:28:05.142 --> 00:28:06.684
Chrissy would come every week
with her dad.

511
00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:08.185
and while he was looking
at camping gear.

512
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.687
she would play with this old cat

513
00:28:09.772 --> 00:28:10.979
that liked to hang around
the shop.

514
00:28:11.107 --> 00:28:12.147
A mean little tabby

515
00:28:12.274 --> 00:28:13.941
who liked to sass the customers.

516
00:28:14.026 --> 00:28:16.143
Sassed me once or twice. too.
and I did not like it.

517
00:28:16.237 --> 00:28:19.530
Oh. I remember that cat.

518
00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:22.658
Anyway. that old cat will only
let one person ever pet him.

519
00:28:22.785 --> 00:28:24.326
-And that was Chrissy.
-That's right.

520
00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:28.321
I guess even a evil.
mean. old. grumpy sourpuss

521
00:28:28.416 --> 00:28:29.832
knew a good egg when he saw one.

522
00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:32.993
-That's very sweet of ya. Bruce.
-Well. it's true.

523
00:28:33.087 --> 00:28:35.587
Now. about that bike.
I think I know the perfect one.

524
00:28:35.673 --> 00:28:37.089
Okay.

525
00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:41.051
-Bruce.
-Good people.

526
00:28:41.137 --> 00:28:43.887
-Such good people.
-Really good people.

527
00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:46.682
-Oh. Ahem.
-Oh. wow.

528
00:28:46.809 --> 00:28:51.103
A reindeer bike.
Just like your new song.

529
00:28:51.188 --> 00:28:54.690
-Wow! That is quite a bike.
-Mm-hmm.

530
00:28:54.817 --> 00:28:56.358
Uh. oh. Chrissy. would you mind

531
00:28:56.485 --> 00:28:57.985
if I took Rudolph here
for a spin?

532
00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.353
Oh. You know what?
You go for it.

533
00:29:00.448 --> 00:29:02.865
-I'm-I'm gonna walk.
-Oh. awesome.

534
00:29:05.035 --> 00:29:06.744
-Bruce. I'll see you later.
-See ya.

535
00:29:06.829 --> 00:29:07.911
Okay.

536
00:30:07.264 --> 00:30:08.472
Chrissy?

537
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.391
Oh. no. Oh.

538
00:30:12.895 --> 00:30:15.938
Ooh. Oh! Uh...

539
00:30:16.065 --> 00:30:18.190
-Wait. Chrissy. what are you--
-I'm okay!

540
00:30:18.275 --> 00:30:20.651
All right. come inside.
It's about to pour.

541
00:30:20.736 --> 00:30:22.611
God! Ah!

542
00:30:44.635 --> 00:30:46.093
Ahem.

543
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.930
Tea?

544
00:30:50.015 --> 00:30:52.140
Appreciate that.
but that's really not necessary.

545
00:30:52.268 --> 00:30:54.142
I won't be here much longer.

546
00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.854
I'm leaving as soon
as this storm clears up.

547
00:30:56.939 --> 00:30:59.982
Well. I wouldn't hold
your breath.

548
00:31:00.109 --> 00:31:03.485
Still no power and
all the roads are washed out.

549
00:31:03.612 --> 00:31:05.145
I won't be able
to drive you back to the lodge

550
00:31:05.239 --> 00:31:06.196
until tomorrow morning.

551
00:31:06.282 --> 00:31:08.407
Oh. just a nightmare.

552
00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:14.621
Ow.

553
00:31:20.462 --> 00:31:22.212
Well. this is lovely.

554
00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:29.344
So. you. uh. I don't know.
wanna explain to me

555
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:30.929
what you were doing
out there or..

556
00:31:31.015 --> 00:31:33.432
I don't know.
I don't know.

557
00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:35.267
Oh. you know what.
maybe it has something to do

558
00:31:35.352 --> 00:31:38.395
with that little rant of yours
last night.

559
00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.105
Maybe I should have just
left you out in the rain.

560
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:45.352
Luke. you basically said
I didn't belong here anymore.

561
00:31:45.446 --> 00:31:48.155
that I don't have the right
to call this place home.

562
00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:56.029
You know what the worst part
of all this is?

563
00:31:56.123 --> 00:31:57.706
You were right.

564
00:32:02.171 --> 00:32:06.548
You were right.
I should have come back sooner.

565
00:32:06.675 --> 00:32:10.844
And I wish I hadn't stayed away
for so long.

566
00:32:13.724 --> 00:32:16.391
Can I ask why you did?

567
00:32:16.518 --> 00:32:18.560
I mean. was it because
you were ashamed

568
00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:21.221
of your hometown roots
after you became famous?

569
00:32:21.315 --> 00:32:25.442
No. no.
It's the exact opposite.

570
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:28.236
Luke...

571
00:32:29.281 --> 00:32:31.990
Leaving Cedar Pines was

572
00:32:32.076 --> 00:32:35.077
one of the toughest decisions
I've ever had to make.

573
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:38.163
And I was afraid

574
00:32:38.248 --> 00:32:42.167
that if I came back.

575
00:32:42.252 --> 00:32:44.753
I just wouldn't have
the strength to leave again.

576
00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.134
Um. I always wondered
about that.

577
00:33:03.565 --> 00:33:08.110
Say. um. I told Brandon
I would make Christmas cookies

578
00:33:08.237 --> 00:33:11.863
for him and his friends.
He's sleeping at Pearl's house.

579
00:33:11.949 --> 00:33:14.866
And given
we have nothing better to do.

580
00:33:14.952 --> 00:33:17.944
would you like to help me frost
'em. so I can surprise him

581
00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:19.663
when he gets here
in the morning?

582
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.125
Yeah. Sounds fun.

583
00:33:25.004 --> 00:33:28.588
-Great. Okay.
-Okay.

584
00:33:36.849 --> 00:33:38.181
So you mentioned
last night

585
00:33:38.267 --> 00:33:41.018
you were doing a concert
here in town.

586
00:33:41.103 --> 00:33:44.646
-I am.
-Well. that's exciting.

587
00:33:46.025 --> 00:33:48.567
Thanks.

588
00:33:48.652 --> 00:33:53.155
If I'm completely honest. I'm
extremely stressed out about it.

589
00:33:53.282 --> 00:33:54.865
Yeah? Why is that?

590
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:59.369
I released a song called
Reindeer Slaay.

591
00:33:59.455 --> 00:34:04.491
and to say the least.
it did not slay at all.

592
00:34:04.585 --> 00:34:09.087
Yeah. I. um.
I keep up with your career.

593
00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:14.217
-You do?
-Of course. I do.

594
00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:21.224
Ah. continue.

595
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:28.732
Right. So I agreed to debut
a new song at my concert.

596
00:34:28.817 --> 00:34:31.902
Problem is. all the songs that
they've sent me aren't any good.

597
00:34:31.987 --> 00:34:35.655
and I'd rather write
an original song.

598
00:34:35.741 --> 00:34:38.033
But truth be told.

599
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:42.036
I have been off my game
for quite some time now.

600
00:34:48.045 --> 00:34:51.588
-Three chords.
-What?

601
00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:54.591
The key to writing a good song

602
00:34:54.676 --> 00:34:57.552
is three chords and the truth.

603
00:34:57.679 --> 00:34:59.304
Don't overthink it.

604
00:35:04.228 --> 00:35:05.560
I mean. Luke...

605
00:35:07.189 --> 00:35:09.981
you're brilliant.

606
00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:13.985
Thank you. but that was not
mine. It is a famous quote--

607
00:35:14.071 --> 00:35:16.321
No. not that. when you said.
"Don't overthink it."

608
00:35:16.406 --> 00:35:19.324
that's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm over-thinking it.

609
00:35:19.409 --> 00:35:22.068
What are you getting at?

610
00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:23.870
I just mean there's no way
I'm gonna be able

611
00:35:23.956 --> 00:35:26.581
to magically write a hit song
in five days.

612
00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:28.333
because I'm way too in my head.

613
00:35:28.418 --> 00:35:31.670
And I don't want to debut a new
song written by a stranger.

614
00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:35.215
-I just don't.
-Yeah.

615
00:35:40.389 --> 00:35:44.266
What if you wrote a song
with me?

616
00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:51.481
Oh. gosh! I-I don't. I don't...
I don't know about that.

617
00:35:51.567 --> 00:35:55.318
Please. Please. Luke.
This means everything to me.

618
00:35:55.404 --> 00:35:58.446
And you are the best songwriter
I have ever met.

619
00:36:01.952 --> 00:36:04.327
Chrissy. I-I appreciate that.
and I-I would help.

620
00:36:04.413 --> 00:36:08.248
but I don't even know
if I know how to anymore.

621
00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:09.958
I mean. I can't even remember
the last time

622
00:36:10.085 --> 00:36:11.451
I picked up a guitar.

623
00:36:11.545 --> 00:36:13.962
No time like the present.

624
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:16.047
I'm sorry. Chrissy.

625
00:36:16.133 --> 00:36:18.216
Okay. okay. okay. listen.

626
00:36:18.302 --> 00:36:21.794
Do you remember when we were
still gigging together?

627
00:36:21.889 --> 00:36:26.099
It didn't matter if they wanted
to book us or not.

628
00:36:26.185 --> 00:36:29.186
You would do anything
to get them to let us play.

629
00:36:29.271 --> 00:36:33.940
You know. and sometimes
you would offer a trade.

630
00:36:34.026 --> 00:36:37.110
Like. in Lake City
when you promised

631
00:36:37.196 --> 00:36:39.988
that we would bus tables
for a week

632
00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:42.574
if they let us play
three songs on stage?

633
00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:43.867
Ah...

634
00:36:45.287 --> 00:36:47.329
Okay. So?

635
00:36:47.456 --> 00:36:50.624
So you agree to write the song

636
00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:54.794
and I promise. I will do
anything you want.

637
00:36:56.298 --> 00:36:58.965
I don't want anything.
Chrissy. Uh...

638
00:36:59.051 --> 00:37:02.219
All right.
maybe you don't want anything.

639
00:37:02.304 --> 00:37:05.555
but someone you know might.

640
00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:11.937
I do actually know someone

641
00:37:12.022 --> 00:37:15.190
who needs something.

642
00:37:15.317 --> 00:37:19.778
When you walked in that bar.
Pearl lit up.

643
00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:23.406
You mean a lot to the people
of this town. Chrissy.

644
00:37:23.492 --> 00:37:25.024
You're the one that made it.

645
00:37:25.118 --> 00:37:29.704
Every song you release.
every video that premieres.

646
00:37:29.831 --> 00:37:33.792
everybody gets together
every time to watch them.

647
00:37:40.175 --> 00:37:44.386
Um. yeah. I. uh.
I didn't realize that.

648
00:37:46.473 --> 00:37:50.308
Anyways. Pearl asked me

649
00:37:50.394 --> 00:37:53.895
to host her annual
Christmas Eve party.

650
00:37:54.022 --> 00:37:55.272
You know.
she's slowing down a bit.

651
00:37:55.357 --> 00:37:56.940
so I told her I would help.

652
00:37:57.025 --> 00:37:58.608
I remember that party.

653
00:37:58.694 --> 00:38:01.653
No one throws a Christmas bash
like your grandma.

654
00:38:01.738 --> 00:38:05.323
Nope. And she puts
a lot of pride in that party.

655
00:38:05.409 --> 00:38:07.200
Yeah.

656
00:38:07.286 --> 00:38:10.745
The point is. I know how much
it would mean to everyone

657
00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:13.239
to see you perform here again.

658
00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:17.377
And. oh. and if you sing
at grandma's party.

659
00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:20.463
well. that would just about
make her life.

660
00:38:20.549 --> 00:38:24.259
So if you want me to help you

661
00:38:24.386 --> 00:38:25.844
write this Christmas song--

662
00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:27.721
Consider it done.

663
00:38:32.227 --> 00:38:35.979
That was fast.
You have yourself a deal.

664
00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:42.110
Oh. What have I done?

665
00:38:43.822 --> 00:38:46.573
-You're gonna love it.
-Oh. man.

666
00:38:47.743 --> 00:38:49.993
Well. I'm exhausted.

667
00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:53.413
Yeah. Yeah. you read my mind.
I'm tired. too.

668
00:38:53.498 --> 00:38:55.999
And I don't think you're getting
out of here anytime soon.

669
00:38:56.084 --> 00:38:57.375
No.

670
00:38:57.461 --> 00:39:01.004
So why don't I

671
00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:05.091
make a bed on the couch and...

672
00:39:05.177 --> 00:39:08.595
-Well...
-Yeah. Yeah. that's perfect.

673
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.806
-Thank you.
-Great.

674
00:39:11.933 --> 00:39:14.351
We'll clean this up
in the morning. Yeah.

675
00:39:14.436 --> 00:39:16.728
I love leaving dishes
for tomorrow.

676
00:39:27.783 --> 00:39:29.982
All right.

677
00:39:30.077 --> 00:39:32.160
-There you go.
-Thanks.

678
00:39:35.248 --> 00:39:37.791
Mm. It's cozy.

679
00:39:40.796 --> 00:39:42.003
What?

680
00:39:43.507 --> 00:39:45.548
Oh.

681
00:39:45.634 --> 00:39:47.166
It's just been a while

682
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:51.721
since I've seen you
wrapped in that blanket.

683
00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:56.184
Yeah.

684
00:39:59.815 --> 00:40:02.190
I noticed you don't have
many Christmas decorations up.

685
00:40:02.317 --> 00:40:04.234
You don't even have a tree.

686
00:40:05.153 --> 00:40:06.611
Yeah.

687
00:40:06.696 --> 00:40:10.240
Well... it's been a while

688
00:40:10.325 --> 00:40:13.827
since I've felt like
celebrating Christmas. so...

689
00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:16.121
Right.

690
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.583
All right.

691
00:40:25.215 --> 00:40:27.257
Goodnight. Chrissy.

692
00:40:27.342 --> 00:40:28.883
Goodnight. Luke.

693
00:40:52.159 --> 00:40:56.661
Hey. You must be Brandon.

694
00:40:56.746 --> 00:40:59.914
-Wait. Y-you know my name?
-Y-you know what. you're good.

695
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:02.250
You're good. Good with
the syrup. good with the syrup.

696
00:41:03.879 --> 00:41:07.922
Uh. um. you know. I-I'm. like.
your biggest fan.

697
00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:09.799
I-I love all your music.

698
00:41:09.885 --> 00:41:13.136
That so? Even Reindeer Slaay?

699
00:41:13.221 --> 00:41:17.390
Um. is that a trick question?

700
00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:21.561
You're funny!

701
00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:24.931
You know. I-I always suspected
that I'm funny. so...

702
00:41:25.025 --> 00:41:26.441
-You're right.
-Oh. wow.

703
00:41:26.568 --> 00:41:29.068
I see the two of you
have already met.

704
00:41:29.154 --> 00:41:31.613
Uncle Luke.
she thinks I'm funny.

705
00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.657
-Yeah. Yeah. Funny-looking.
-No.

706
00:41:34.743 --> 00:41:37.619
-Can I make you some breakfast?
-Yeah. Yeah.

707
00:41:37.746 --> 00:41:39.954
Oh. Uncle Luke. do you think
she can come with us

708
00:41:40.081 --> 00:41:41.873
to buy the Christmas tree
for your restaurant?

709
00:41:41.958 --> 00:41:44.167
Oh. bud. I'm sure she's got
better things she needs to--

710
00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:45.960
I'm not busy.

711
00:41:46.087 --> 00:41:48.505
We don't start rehearsals again
until tomorrow.

712
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.790
Okay. Great.

713
00:41:50.884 --> 00:41:52.217
Perfect. and we'll pick up
a tree

714
00:41:52.302 --> 00:41:53.626
for your place. too.
while we're at it.

715
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.512
-Sweet!
-Oh.

716
00:41:55.597 --> 00:41:59.182
Two trees. Even better.
Double the fun.

717
00:42:02.896 --> 00:42:06.064
Ha-ha. no. you're
lying. Chrissy didn't actually

718
00:42:06.149 --> 00:42:07.640
get stuck
at her ex-boyfriend's house.

719
00:42:07.734 --> 00:42:10.193
I swear. She had to
spend the night and everything.

720
00:42:10.278 --> 00:42:13.363
Wow. You are never going to
let her live this down. are you?

721
00:42:13.448 --> 00:42:17.033
Oh. honey. Never.
I should probably go.

722
00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:19.118
Chrissy is here to buy
a couple of Christmas trees.

723
00:42:19.204 --> 00:42:20.828
She'll need my help
carrying them to the car.

724
00:42:20.956 --> 00:42:24.457
-Okay. go. Love you.
-Love you. too.

725
00:42:32.509 --> 00:42:36.135
Well. let's just get one.

726
00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:38.671
-A tree is a tree. isn't it?
-Ah. no.

727
00:42:38.765 --> 00:42:42.350
Okay. like. a spruce is not good
for a Christmas tree.

728
00:42:42.477 --> 00:42:43.977
It just loses its shape
too fast.

729
00:42:44.062 --> 00:42:46.938
But. like. this one.
right here. this one's perfect.

730
00:42:47.023 --> 00:42:50.108
You cannot go wrong
with a classic Fraser fir.

731
00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:54.195
Okay. okay. Great.
We found our tree. Let's get it.

732
00:42:54.322 --> 00:42:56.531
All right.
Brandon. what do you think?

733
00:42:56.658 --> 00:42:58.908
-Brandon?
-Brandon?

734
00:42:58.994 --> 00:43:01.369
-Brandon?
-Brandon!

735
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:04.747
Oh. found him. Luke.

736
00:43:04.833 --> 00:43:07.834
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey. Brandon.

737
00:43:07.919 --> 00:43:10.003
You gotta stay with us. bud.

738
00:43:13.758 --> 00:43:15.550
Oh.

739
00:43:15.677 --> 00:43:18.177
So who's the lady?

740
00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:21.389
Her name is Emily.

741
00:43:21.516 --> 00:43:24.809
Okay. All right. Are you gonna.
you gonna talk to her?

742
00:43:24.894 --> 00:43:26.936
You're just gonna
stand here and stare?

743
00:43:27.022 --> 00:43:29.772
-Can't talk.
-Oh. come on.

744
00:43:29.858 --> 00:43:32.400
Just. just go up to her.
You got this.

745
00:43:32.527 --> 00:43:35.778
Cannot talk.

746
00:43:35.864 --> 00:43:38.031
Okay. Well.
now you sound like a robot.

747
00:43:38.116 --> 00:43:40.742
Okay. Come here. I'm gonna.
I'm gonna help you out.

748
00:43:40.869 --> 00:43:43.036
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

749
00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:45.872
So rule number one.
if you want a girl to like you.

750
00:43:45.957 --> 00:43:48.249
she has to notice you first.
right?

751
00:43:48.376 --> 00:43:51.836
And what is the best way
to do that? Is dance.

752
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:54.339
Hey. got anything funky?

753
00:43:54.424 --> 00:43:55.965
-I got you.
-Okay.

754
00:43:56.051 --> 00:43:57.967
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about the moves.

755
00:43:58.053 --> 00:44:00.928
It's about confidence inside.
Okay?

756
00:44:01.056 --> 00:44:02.930
Okay. Listen to the music.

757
00:44:06.561 --> 00:44:10.813
Feel it? Yeah? And...
Yeah! You got it.

758
00:44:10.899 --> 00:44:14.317
You're better than-than you
think you thought out to be.

759
00:44:14.402 --> 00:44:16.268
Come on. Brandon.
show us what you got.

760
00:44:24.746 --> 00:44:25.787
Yes!

761
00:44:27.832 --> 00:44:28.781
Yes!

762
00:44:46.059 --> 00:44:49.310
Hey. thanks for helping
Brandon out today.

763
00:44:49.437 --> 00:44:53.147
Aww. He's too cute.
Little Casanova in training.

764
00:44:53.274 --> 00:44:56.526
I sure wish he'd slow down.

765
00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:59.153
Well. I'm not ready
for him to grow up.

766
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.240
Well. I think you got some time.

767
00:45:02.325 --> 00:45:05.618
He doesn't even know how to
pour syrup over pancakes yet.

768
00:45:08.123 --> 00:45:11.499
-What's in the box? Hm.
-Oh. yeah. This?

769
00:45:11.626 --> 00:45:16.713
It's a... You know. some stuff
from back in the day.

770
00:45:16.798 --> 00:45:17.922
It's...

771
00:45:18.967 --> 00:45:22.176
Let's see here. We got...

772
00:45:22.303 --> 00:45:26.180
Oh. Tickets
from our first concerts.

773
00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:31.018
What is that?

774
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:36.607
-Wow! I have not seen this.
-What is that?

775
00:45:38.111 --> 00:45:39.277
No...

776
00:45:41.698 --> 00:45:44.866
It's our Live At The Dockhouse
flyer.

777
00:45:44.993 --> 00:45:47.827
Oh. look at the music notes
we put on there.

778
00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:50.455
Oh. my...

779
00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.082
We have a very early recording

780
00:45:53.168 --> 00:45:58.296
from the one and only
Chrissy Kessler.

781
00:45:58.381 --> 00:46:01.549
-Oh. dear.
-And. of course. yours truly.

782
00:46:03.219 --> 00:46:06.012
I can't believe
you kept all of this.

783
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:21.527
Man. we were good.

784
00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:25.865
Yeah. We were.

785
00:46:32.081 --> 00:46:33.206
Oh. I remember.

786
00:46:49.849 --> 00:46:51.349
Luke?

787
00:46:53.812 --> 00:46:57.897
I never meant to leave you
on Christmas.

788
00:46:57.982 --> 00:47:00.858
Oh. it's. it's in the past.
Chrissy.

789
00:47:00.944 --> 00:47:02.068
-It's fine.
-No. wait. please. Please.

790
00:47:02.153 --> 00:47:04.362
Please. just. let me just

791
00:47:04.447 --> 00:47:08.199
say this once. okay. and then
I'll never mention it again.

792
00:47:11.246 --> 00:47:12.286
Okay.

793
00:47:16.584 --> 00:47:18.376
Christmas morning.

794
00:47:18.461 --> 00:47:22.213
my parents surprised me
with a gift.

795
00:47:22.298 --> 00:47:27.093
My mom was wiping away tears
and I didn't understand why

796
00:47:27.178 --> 00:47:29.679
until I saw
what she was holding.

797
00:47:31.307 --> 00:47:33.474
It was a one-way ticket
to Nashville.

798
00:47:34.477 --> 00:47:37.186
And they were so happy for me.

799
00:47:37.272 --> 00:47:40.022
And I just. I just remember

800
00:47:40.108 --> 00:47:43.192
being so. so scared.

801
00:47:45.446 --> 00:47:47.780
I mean. that was everything
I ever wanted.

802
00:47:47.866 --> 00:47:49.907
But you have no idea
how terrifying a dream can be

803
00:47:49.993 --> 00:47:53.619
until you have the chance
to chase it.

804
00:47:53.705 --> 00:47:56.998
And I remember. I sat there
in my room for hours.

805
00:47:57.125 --> 00:48:01.460
and all I could think about
was you.

806
00:48:02.463 --> 00:48:05.840
Not Nashville. not my dream...

807
00:48:07.176 --> 00:48:08.342
you.

808
00:48:10.179 --> 00:48:12.722
Luke. I wanted you
to come with me.

809
00:48:12.807 --> 00:48:14.807
but you had already made it
perfectly clear

810
00:48:14.893 --> 00:48:18.060
that you had no intention
of ever leaving Cedar Pines.

811
00:48:18.146 --> 00:48:21.647
And I-I just knew. I knew
that if I didn't break it off

812
00:48:21.733 --> 00:48:25.484
right then. I never would.

813
00:48:26.988 --> 00:48:30.907
I was. I was 28.

814
00:48:30.992 --> 00:48:33.284
and I felt like
that this was my last chance.

815
00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:36.287
you know.
to take my. take my shot.

816
00:48:36.372 --> 00:48:39.123
And all I could think to do
at that time

817
00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:42.168
was write a note...

818
00:48:43.838 --> 00:48:46.172
and slip it under your door.

819
00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:48.549
And I knew that

820
00:48:48.676 --> 00:48:52.878
you would never ever call me

821
00:48:52.972 --> 00:48:57.516
'cause you just said
that if I ever chose to leave.

822
00:48:57.602 --> 00:49:00.061
that you wouldn't stop me.

823
00:49:00.188 --> 00:49:03.314
You have no idea how many times
I reached for that phone

824
00:49:03.399 --> 00:49:05.024
to call you.

825
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:07.318
I swear.
I never meant to hurt you.

826
00:49:07.403 --> 00:49:09.278
especially on Christmas.

827
00:49:09.364 --> 00:49:11.280
I mean. our first kiss
as teenagers

828
00:49:11.366 --> 00:49:13.824
was on Christmas Eve. Luke.

829
00:49:15.203 --> 00:49:17.453
You deserved so much better.

830
00:49:20.083 --> 00:49:22.166
I am very. very sorry.

831
00:49:25.505 --> 00:49:26.545
Oh.

832
00:49:31.886 --> 00:49:33.094
Well...

833
00:49:35.223 --> 00:49:36.681
I mean. if I'm being honest.

834
00:49:36.766 --> 00:49:41.018
I. I was hurt back then.

835
00:49:42.605 --> 00:49:44.271
That's okay.

836
00:49:44.399 --> 00:49:47.400
These past couple of days
I have started to think

837
00:49:47.485 --> 00:49:50.903
about life back then
through a different lens.

838
00:49:53.449 --> 00:49:57.326
How can I resent my past

839
00:49:57.412 --> 00:49:59.620
when you are my past. Chrissy?

840
00:50:02.959 --> 00:50:04.166
No.

841
00:50:07.964 --> 00:50:10.006
What do say we go back in time?

842
00:50:11.759 --> 00:50:13.801
Even if it's just for a night?

843
00:51:04.562 --> 00:51:05.895
Hey. guys.
before we get started...

844
00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.064
Um. you know. uh.
when I made the decision

845
00:51:08.149 --> 00:51:10.483
to come back to Cedar Pines
to do this concert.

846
00:51:10.568 --> 00:51:13.852
I knew that this spot
was where I wanted to stage it.

847
00:51:13.946 --> 00:51:16.113
The very first time
I played for an audience

848
00:51:16.199 --> 00:51:18.491
was right here on Main Street.

849
00:51:18.576 --> 00:51:20.659
Of course. back then
I was the opening act

850
00:51:20.745 --> 00:51:23.954
at the Cedar Pines County Fair.
Thank you very much.

851
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.664
And I know
it-it doesn't sound like much.

852
00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.958
but. uh. uh. I don't know.

853
00:51:28.044 --> 00:51:31.378
it felt like
the opportunity of a lifetime.

854
00:51:31.506 --> 00:51:35.049
The point is
I still feel that same way

855
00:51:35.176 --> 00:51:38.469
every single time
I get to perform for a crowd

856
00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:40.387
whether big or small.

857
00:51:40.515 --> 00:51:42.765
So I just. I don't know.
I just wanted you

858
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:45.717
to try and think about that
while we're rehearsing today.

859
00:51:45.812 --> 00:51:50.689
You know. this place
is part of my story.

860
00:51:51.943 --> 00:51:54.235
All right. Let's do this.

861
00:52:11.087 --> 00:52:12.795
More of it.

862
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.840
Yeah. Yeah. There we go.

863
00:52:28.437 --> 00:52:30.437
Bye. guys. Thank you.

864
00:52:30.565 --> 00:52:32.982
-There she is.
-Hi.

865
00:52:33.067 --> 00:52:34.933
Gingerbread latte
from the Coffee Corner.

866
00:52:35.027 --> 00:52:38.404
Oh. you read my mind! Mm.

867
00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:41.699
Oh...

868
00:52:41.784 --> 00:52:45.119
Why is this still the best
gingerbread latte in the world?

869
00:52:45.246 --> 00:52:46.996
Well. because
it's locally-sourced

870
00:52:47.081 --> 00:52:48.780
farm-to-table gingerbread men--

871
00:52:48.875 --> 00:52:51.041
Stop it! Stop it!

872
00:52:51.127 --> 00:52:54.962
-Come on.
-I didn't know this side of you.

873
00:52:55.923 --> 00:52:57.882
How. how were rehearsals?

874
00:52:57.967 --> 00:53:01.302
Ah. you know. they went
as good as they could go.

875
00:53:01.429 --> 00:53:03.554
all things considered.

876
00:53:03.639 --> 00:53:06.798
I told you that we would get
this song. Don't worry.

877
00:53:06.893 --> 00:53:09.476
I know. I know.
but I am worried.

878
00:53:09.604 --> 00:53:11.812
Carole and the label
are both losing patience.

879
00:53:11.939 --> 00:53:15.524
I don't know. Luke. if we don't
come up with something quick.

880
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.643
they're gonna make me
sing those demos.

881
00:53:17.737 --> 00:53:19.645
-Well...

882
00:53:19.739 --> 00:53:21.030
Oh.

883
00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:26.911
-That her?
-Yeah. Relentless.

884
00:53:29.457 --> 00:53:32.166
You know. you don't need

885
00:53:32.293 --> 00:53:34.710
someone else
calling the shots for you.

886
00:53:34.795 --> 00:53:37.171
because not only
are you talented.

887
00:53:37.298 --> 00:53:39.131
you're also
the smartest woman I know.

888
00:53:39.217 --> 00:53:42.718
You could easily be calling
your own shots.

889
00:53:46.557 --> 00:53:48.682
Thank you. Luke.

890
00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:50.059
You know. that's exactly why

891
00:53:50.144 --> 00:53:52.678
we have to keep working
on this song.

892
00:53:52.772 --> 00:53:55.940
Yes. Right after we get to work
decorating the bar.

893
00:53:56.025 --> 00:53:57.775
-Oh. yeah. Yeah. yeah.
-Brandon. Pearl already there.

894
00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.235
Oh. Let's pick the pace. then.

895
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.569
Ah. we have a lot of work to do

896
00:54:00.655 --> 00:54:01.570
and exactly zero time.

897
00:54:01.656 --> 00:54:02.738
No time. Let's go.

898
00:54:02.823 --> 00:54:04.198
Just lettin' you know.

899
00:54:09.872 --> 00:54:11.080
-Hi.
-Hi.

900
00:54:11.165 --> 00:54:12.998
Who's ready to decorate?

901
00:54:13.084 --> 00:54:15.793
I have been ready to decorate
this place since May.

902
00:54:17.171 --> 00:54:18.754
Hey. Uncle Luke.
Grandma Pearl said

903
00:54:18.839 --> 00:54:20.714
that I get to choose the music
this time.

904
00:54:20.841 --> 00:54:22.424
All right. go for it. buddy.

905
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:24.510
I already know what I'm playin'.

906
00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:26.637
It's my all-time favorite
Christmas song.

907
00:54:26.722 --> 00:54:28.213
Jingle Bells.
the Chrissy edition.

908
00:54:28.307 --> 00:54:29.556
Aww...

909
00:56:07.948 --> 00:56:10.407
All right. grandma. Get in here.
Here's the moment.

910
00:56:10.493 --> 00:56:12.826
-Oh!
-All right. we ready?

911
00:56:12.953 --> 00:56:14.286
Plug her in. bud.

912
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:17.039
-Ah!
-Ooh!

913
00:56:17.124 --> 00:56:18.082
-Oh.
-Okay.

914
00:56:18.167 --> 00:56:19.416
Sweet.

915
00:56:30.304 --> 00:56:32.337
-I don't know. Like. w...

916
00:56:36.811 --> 00:56:38.936
-Yeah. Well?
-I don't know.

917
00:56:39.021 --> 00:56:41.063
It all feels like junk.
everything we've written.

918
00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:43.690
I feel like.
like I'm letting you down.

919
00:56:43.818 --> 00:56:45.984
No. not everything is junk.

920
00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:48.862
I kinda liked the last song
we came up with.

921
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:51.857
What was that?

922
00:56:57.081 --> 00:56:59.790
When The Rooster Crows
It's Christmas?

923
00:56:59.875 --> 00:57:04.002
When The Rooster Crows.
It's Christmas.

924
00:57:04.088 --> 00:57:07.089
-Wait. what does that even mean?
-I think it means...

925
00:57:07.174 --> 00:57:09.967
It's time to call it a night.

926
00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:15.889
Yeah.

927
00:57:16.016 --> 00:57:17.716
If that's not
some kind of omen...

928
00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:21.437
No. Look. Chrissy. I...

929
00:57:21.522 --> 00:57:24.231
I don't know
if I have it in me anymore.

930
00:57:24.358 --> 00:57:26.442
I mean.
I-I know what I-I said.

931
00:57:26.527 --> 00:57:28.068
and I. and I meant it.
but I don't see

932
00:57:28.195 --> 00:57:30.571
how we're gonna get this done
in the next two days.

933
00:57:30.698 --> 00:57:33.615
Listen. you've written
some really nice stuff. Luke.

934
00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:36.118
Don't flatter me.
It's not gonna work.

935
00:57:36.203 --> 00:57:39.204
I'm not. It's in there. It is.

936
00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:42.124
Maybe.

937
00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.088
But you're right.
It's kinda gettin' late.

938
00:57:48.215 --> 00:57:50.841
We both need to rest up
for the big party tomorrow.

939
00:57:50.926 --> 00:57:52.342
Oh. by the way.
can you check on Pearl

940
00:57:52.428 --> 00:57:54.136
and make sure she's got
her snow tires on?

941
00:57:54.221 --> 00:57:56.638
I hear we're supposed to get
the first heavy snow

942
00:57:56.724 --> 00:58:00.976
of the season tomorrow.
just in time for Christmas Eve.

943
00:58:02.563 --> 00:58:05.772
Hey. don't worry about it.
You're off the hook.

944
00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.316
I couldn't help you
write your song.

945
00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:10.277
so you don't have to play
at the party.

946
00:58:10.404 --> 00:58:12.946
-Deal's a deal.
-What deal?

947
00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:15.532
Song or no song.
I will be there.

948
00:58:15.618 --> 00:58:17.784
You know you're stuck
with me now. Luke.

949
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:20.120
Thank you. Chrissy.

950
00:58:20.247 --> 00:58:22.039
Don't mention it.

951
00:58:22.124 --> 00:58:23.957
Besides. I already promised
Pearl I'd stay and guard

952
00:58:24.084 --> 00:58:25.709
while she spiked the eggnog.

953
00:58:25.794 --> 00:58:28.378
-Oh. boy.

954
00:58:28.464 --> 00:58:30.214
Well. seein' you there tomorrow

955
00:58:30.299 --> 00:58:32.799
is gonna mean a whole lot
to those folks.

956
00:58:34.637 --> 00:58:37.179
Means a whole lot to me. too.

957
00:58:39.433 --> 00:58:42.142
-Goodnight. Luke.
-Goodnight. Chrissy.

958
00:58:44.605 --> 00:58:47.064
-Want me to walk you out?
-No.

959
00:59:26.021 --> 00:59:27.729
And there's no signs
of it stopping.

960
00:59:27.815 --> 00:59:30.107
We're expecting anywhere
from six to eight inches

961
00:59:30.192 --> 00:59:32.442
of snow tonight.
I am urging everyone

962
00:59:32.528 --> 00:59:35.487
to stay off the roads and
remain at home. Back to you.

963
00:59:37.408 --> 00:59:40.784
Well. that's that.

964
00:59:40.869 --> 00:59:44.121
Don't suppose
there'll be a party tonight.

965
00:59:44.206 --> 00:59:46.698
Yeah. Is Pearl gonna
let the guests know?

966
00:59:46.792 --> 00:59:49.710
Yeah. I think she was waiting
for the official word.

967
00:59:49.837 --> 00:59:52.546
I imagine she's probably letting
everybody know right now.

968
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:56.708
Tsk. So sorry. Luke.

969
00:59:56.802 --> 00:59:58.010
Man!

970
00:59:59.054 --> 01:00:00.971
All of this for nothing.

971
01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:03.765
Not nothing.

972
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:09.521
What?

973
01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:13.066
What are you doing?

974
01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:16.737
Well. it's still Christmas Eve.

975
01:00:16.864 --> 01:00:19.114
-Isn't it?
-Yeah.

976
01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:21.783
Then there's still cause
to celebrate.

977
01:00:21.869 --> 01:00:24.161
-Oh.

978
01:00:24.246 --> 01:00:25.746
Fair enough.

979
01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:30.584
-What have we got here?
-It's the least I could do.

980
01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:33.587
For you.

981
01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:43.347
Thank you.

982
01:00:43.432 --> 01:00:47.059
-Merry Christmas Eve.
-Ditto.

983
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.525
Ah...

984
01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:58.278
-It's nice.
-It's very nice.

985
01:00:58.405 --> 01:01:02.115
So. got you
a little Christmas gift.

986
01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:04.534
-You did?
-Yeah.

987
01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.161
It's just a little something.
It's not even wrapped.

988
01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:08.705
Oh. glad to see you didn't go
to too much trouble.

989
01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:10.499
Stop.

990
01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:12.918
-Okay.
-Hm.

991
01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:16.922
-You're ready?
-Mm-hmm.

992
01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:29.393
After you stole this
from the band room at school.

993
01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:31.478
do you remember what you did?

994
01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:34.189
You gave it to me.

995
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.527
This is still the only one
I ever use.

996
01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:44.574
I think this pick is lucky.
I really do.

997
01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:48.036
And now...

998
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.623
I want you to have it back.

999
01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.086
Well...

1000
01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:02.008
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1001
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:07.764
Well. I guess
if we're exchanging gifts...

1002
01:02:08.851 --> 01:02:10.684
it's only fair I give you yours.

1003
01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:13.979
-You got me a gift?
-Mm. just a little one.

1004
01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:18.191
You want to. uh.
go take a seat over there?

1005
01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:20.610
-Okay.

1006
01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:31.747
How about you sit in here?

1007
01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:33.331
Well. thank you.

1008
01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.712
I. uh. just...

1009
01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.381
After you left last night.

1010
01:02:50.476 --> 01:02:53.643
I. uh. started
to think about us.

1011
01:02:53.729 --> 01:02:56.438
and. uh. and it hit me.

1012
01:02:56.523 --> 01:03:00.442
I knew exactly what this song
was always meant to be about.

1013
01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:02.861
You wrote the song?

1014
01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.279
Yeah.

1015
01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:07.199
Well. couple of verses
and the chorus.

1016
01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.034
-But..
-All right. Okay. okay.

1017
01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.410
Let's hear it.

1018
01:03:12.873 --> 01:03:15.907
It's been a while.
Been a little rusty.

1019
01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:20.587
But thank goodness
I have my lucky pick.

1020
01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.631
Yeah.

1021
01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:25.592
It's called
Sweet Sixteen Christmas.

1022
01:06:18.058 --> 01:06:19.724
That's our story.

1023
01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:23.520
Yeah. It is.

1024
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.941
Luke.

1025
01:06:31.571 --> 01:06:33.738
We've always been a part
of each other. Chrissy.

1026
01:06:33.824 --> 01:06:35.031
Mm-hmm.

1027
01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.119
-And always will be.

1028
01:06:41.415 --> 01:06:42.831
Chrissy.

1029
01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.166
Brad?

1030
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:51.381
Why is Brad Love here?

1031
01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:52.716
I have no idea.

1032
01:06:52.801 --> 01:06:55.343
Looks like
I'm interrupting something?

1033
01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:57.178
Yeah. kinda.

1034
01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:00.807
Ah. uh. Luke.

1035
01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.976
Brad Love.

1036
01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:05.603
Didn't ever think
I'd be meeting you like this.

1037
01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:08.106
I know. It can be disorienting
to meet a celebrity.

1038
01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:10.150
But I'll let you in
on our little secret.

1039
01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:11.735
We're just people.

1040
01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.862
That's not what I meant. but...

1041
01:07:17.743 --> 01:07:19.284
-Thanks. Um--
-Babe.

1042
01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:23.654
You have no idea
how happy I am to see you.

1043
01:07:23.749 --> 01:07:25.373
You know how crazy
the weather is out there?

1044
01:07:25.459 --> 01:07:27.876
Brad Love really made it through
that blizzard. but luckily

1045
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:31.129
for him. a fearless local
agreed to drive him over here.

1046
01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:33.590
Does he always refer to himself
in the third person?

1047
01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:37.719
No. but sometimes I say
my own name in a sentence.

1048
01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:39.429
My name is my brand.

1049
01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.642
Babe.

1050
01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:47.312
-Let's grab a drink.
-Hm.

1051
01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:50.857
There is so much
I wanna tell you.

1052
01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.067
Brad.

1053
01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:56.738
Do you mind giving us a second
to talk?

1054
01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:59.699
Yeah.

1055
01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:03.328
No. take. take all the time
you want. I'm out of here.

1056
01:08:04.998 --> 01:08:07.698
-Wait. Luke. don't leave.
-Just turn the lights off.

1057
01:08:07.793 --> 01:08:10.710
-When you're done.
-No. wait! Wait!

1058
01:08:14.883 --> 01:08:16.758
Do you mind telling me
what the heck is going on?

1059
01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:18.468
I've been trying to get a hold
of you for days.

1060
01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:20.469
I've been busy.

1061
01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:22.555
Okay.

1062
01:08:25.227 --> 01:08:26.643
This taken?

1063
01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.895
Go for it.

1064
01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:33.441
Who was that?

1065
01:08:33.527 --> 01:08:35.401
I'd rather not talk about him.

1066
01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:38.612
Of course.

1067
01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.700
I really didn't mean to intrude.

1068
01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:44.452
The woman checking me in
at the lodge told me I could

1069
01:08:44.538 --> 01:08:46.371
probably find you here.
I guess there was supposed to be

1070
01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.997
some kind of Christmas party
tonight.

1071
01:08:49.084 --> 01:08:51.542
Yeah. Supposed to be.

1072
01:08:51.628 --> 01:08:54.629
Anyway. sorry if
I got in the way of something.

1073
01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:57.674
Brad. what is this all about?

1074
01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:04.848
Carole is worried
about the concert.

1075
01:09:04.933 --> 01:09:06.890
She flew me out because she
wanted me to come talk to you

1076
01:09:06.977 --> 01:09:09.978
about doing the duet.
I think it could be really good

1077
01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:11.771
for both of our careers.

1078
01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:20.112
I didn't expect you to be caught
so off-guard.

1079
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.447
Carole told me
she already mentioned the

1080
01:09:21.575 --> 01:09:22.615
possibility of a duet to you.

1081
01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:24.450
Yeah. she did pitch me the idea

1082
01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:26.286
and I turned her down.

1083
01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:30.415
I didn't realize that.

1084
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.294
Yeah. well. like you said.
she's worried.

1085
01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:39.381
Well. for whatever it's worth.

1086
01:09:39.467 --> 01:09:42.218
I want you to know I was excited

1087
01:09:42.304 --> 01:09:44.595
by the idea
of doing a duet with you.

1088
01:09:47.267 --> 01:09:50.309
Well. maybe sometime
in the future we can

1089
01:09:50.437 --> 01:09:53.313
collaborate again on something.
but not for a while.

1090
01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.648
I don't want our fans
to get the wrong idea.

1091
01:09:56.818 --> 01:09:58.193
Makes sense.

1092
01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.154
-Okay.
-Okay.

1093
01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:06.534
Well. that's that.

1094
01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.153
I'll fly back to Nashville
as soon as this storm passes.

1095
01:10:09.246 --> 01:10:11.331
Okay.

1096
01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:13.541
Better get back to the lodge
and start packing the suitcase

1097
01:10:13.627 --> 01:10:14.918
I've barely begun unpacking.

1098
01:10:15.003 --> 01:10:17.795
Uh. is your ride still here?

1099
01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.173
Oh. yes.
I was telling you before.

1100
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.841
Local guy with his own truck.

1101
01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:23.092
Not only fearless in a storm.

1102
01:10:23.178 --> 01:10:25.136
but maybe the nicest guy
I've ever met.

1103
01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:29.098
Yeah. That's Cedar Pines.

1104
01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:33.394
Ah. well. actually.
uh. my ride left.

1105
01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:40.068
Shoot. look at me offering a
ride home to another guy's date.

1106
01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:41.568
And if that wasn't already
a trip.

1107
01:10:41.655 --> 01:10:44.614
I'm being asked
by my ex-girlfriend.

1108
01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:47.367
Sounds like a good premise
for a song.

1109
01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:49.327
It does. doesn't it?

1110
01:10:50.496 --> 01:10:52.621
-You ready?
-After you.

1111
01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:08.471
Why do you insist
on mauling your presents

1112
01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:10.473
like some sort of feral coyote?

1113
01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:12.600
-What?
-Well. what do you got there?

1114
01:11:15.063 --> 01:11:16.728
Christmas ties!

1115
01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.398
-Thanks. Uncle Luke.
-You're welcome. bud.

1116
01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:28.866
That's the tenth time
she's called.

1117
01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:31.744
-I don't care.
-Honey...

1118
01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:34.572
Why don't you go
and try on one of those?

1119
01:11:34.666 --> 01:11:36.666
-But which one?
-Um...

1120
01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:40.920
-The gingerbread one.
-That's what I was thinking.

1121
01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:43.089
Uh. you know he doesn't know
how to tie a tie.

1122
01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:46.916
-He's gonna be in there forever.
-And that's the point.

1123
01:11:47.012 --> 01:11:48.594
We need to talk.

1124
01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:53.057
I'm gonna go make some coffee.
Would you like some?

1125
01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:55.101
Stop right there. mister.

1126
01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:59.188
There's nothing to say. grandma.

1127
01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:01.941
Oh. you bet there is.

1128
01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:05.193
Now. you've had a wall up
for some time now.

1129
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.156
and I was just starting to see
that wall come down.

1130
01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:09.949
Don't push her away.

1131
01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:13.202
-Look. I know you like her--
-Hush!

1132
01:12:13.288 --> 01:12:16.621
I am tired of this pity party
that you've got goin' here.

1133
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:18.449
Well. it's not a pity party.

1134
01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:21.210
I mean.
parties are supposed to be fun.

1135
01:12:21.296 --> 01:12:24.213
I heard that.

1136
01:12:24.299 --> 01:12:27.300
Let me ask you this. do you
think it was Chrissy's idea

1137
01:12:27.427 --> 01:12:29.510
to invite that man to town?

1138
01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.348
Well. I mean.
she did text me and say

1139
01:12:33.433 --> 01:12:35.350
that it was her manager's idea
to invite him.

1140
01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:38.144
And do you believe her?

1141
01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:40.146
That's not the point.

1142
01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:42.690
Well. then exactly
what is the point?

1143
01:12:44.486 --> 01:12:48.478
I started to think that things
might actually work out.

1144
01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.907
You know.
these past couple of days

1145
01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:55.952
it. it began to feel like
no time had passed at all.

1146
01:12:56.039 --> 01:12:58.331
It was almost as if
Nashville never happened.

1147
01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:03.127
Yeah. well. Brad walked in
and sobered me up real quick.

1148
01:13:03.213 --> 01:13:05.254
I felt like such a chump.
grandma.

1149
01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.257
How could I let myself forget
that Brad.

1150
01:13:08.343 --> 01:13:10.593
this concert. her career.

1151
01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:13.346
that's Chrissy's real life?
Not me.

1152
01:13:13.473 --> 01:13:15.889
-You don't know that.
-Yes. I do.

1153
01:13:15.975 --> 01:13:20.853
I do know it because all I am
to her is some old yearbook.

1154
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.563
Sure. it's fun
to flip through the pages

1155
01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:25.525
and relive the simpler times.

1156
01:13:25.652 --> 01:13:29.028
But that's only exciting
for so long.

1157
01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:32.323
I mean. it's not as if
I expected Chrissy to just leave

1158
01:13:32.409 --> 01:13:33.950
Nashville and come
and settle down with me

1159
01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:37.161
here in Cedar Pines and...

1160
01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:40.081
Truth is. I didn't think
about how this would work out

1161
01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:43.084
because deep down...

1162
01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:47.797
I think I was afraid
of what the answer would be.

1163
01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:50.708
Well. you're right
about one thing.

1164
01:13:50.802 --> 01:13:52.635
You are a chump.

1165
01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.054
Right.

1166
01:14:08.403 --> 01:14:12.780
Now. Luke. you don't get
to make the rules.

1167
01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:16.409
All these years
you've held on to this grudge.

1168
01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:18.452
like. Chrissy leaving
to go and do

1169
01:14:18.538 --> 01:14:20.913
exactly what she was meant to do

1170
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.500
was some kind of personal
affront to Luke Convington.

1171
01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:28.671
Well. it isn't. Now. I'm not
tryin' to tell you what to do.

1172
01:14:28.755 --> 01:14:30.965
What you decide
is your own business.

1173
01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:33.634
But if you choose to do
nothing at all.

1174
01:14:33.719 --> 01:14:36.637
then that's exactly what
you're gonna get in return.

1175
01:14:39.434 --> 01:14:40.683
Do you hear me?

1176
01:14:43.438 --> 01:14:44.728
Yes. ma'am.

1177
01:14:46.191 --> 01:14:48.107
I love you. kid.

1178
01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:52.153
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

1179
01:14:52.237 --> 01:14:54.697
Oh. I love you. too. grandma.
Thank you.

1180
01:14:57.410 --> 01:15:00.161
Wow.
this blue is gorgeous.

1181
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:03.998
This one.

1182
01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:06.876
-This one is perfect. Thank you.
-Okay.

1183
01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:09.962
-Busy morning.
-Hey.

1184
01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:13.007
-Are you excited for tonight?
-I will be. yeah.

1185
01:15:13.092 --> 01:15:15.635
I'm just distracted. I...

1186
01:15:15.762 --> 01:15:17.303
I just wish things with Luke

1187
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.597
didn't turn out
the way that they did.

1188
01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:21.516
I know.
if there's anything

1189
01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:22.975
I can do for you. let me know.

1190
01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:25.394
No. there's nothing
you can do for me.

1191
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:29.565
but I may have done
a little something for you.

1192
01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:31.859
Huh?

1193
01:15:31.945 --> 01:15:33.193
Turn around.

1194
01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:34.862
Turn around.

1195
01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:41.786
Oh!

1196
01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:47.541
I mean... I...
Well. how did you...

1197
01:15:47.627 --> 01:15:50.169
Uh. I mean. I'm speechless.

1198
01:15:50.296 --> 01:15:52.088
Chrissy actually called Lois
and convinced her

1199
01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:54.840
to give me a couple of days off.

1200
01:15:54.968 --> 01:15:59.003
It-it helps when your boss is a
huge fan of your husband's boss.

1201
01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:02.339
I started to realize
just how fast the years go by.

1202
01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:04.850
Figured five Christmases away
from the one you love

1203
01:16:04.978 --> 01:16:07.019
was a streak
that needed breaking.

1204
01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:10.439
You're the best friend ever.

1205
01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:13.276
-No. You are.

1206
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:18.239
-It's so good to see you.
-It's so good to see you.

1207
01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:19.949
Mitchell. I was so afraid
you weren't gonna get in

1208
01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:21.075
'cause of that storm.

1209
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.869
You and me both. It was crazy.

1210
01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:28.291
So what's it been like
being back home?

1211
01:16:28.376 --> 01:16:30.868
Um. bittersweet.

1212
01:16:30.962 --> 01:16:34.589
I mean. on one hand
it has been amazing.

1213
01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:37.541
I didn't know how much I miss
this place until I came home.

1214
01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:40.636
But. um. you know. just
there's so many more people

1215
01:16:40.722 --> 01:16:43.764
I wish I would've gotten to see.

1216
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.558
Just wish I had
a little more time.

1217
01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:47.518
Well...

1218
01:16:49.856 --> 01:16:52.148
You okay. Chrissy?

1219
01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:54.558
Yeah. Sorry. I'm just gonna
take a second.

1220
01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:55.860
Okay.

1221
01:16:57.697 --> 01:16:59.155
I'll go get settled in the room.

1222
01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.157
-I'll see you in a bit.
-Okay.

1223
01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:09.999
I am so sorry. I did not mean
to ruin that moment.

1224
01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:13.502
I. uh. I guess. until now

1225
01:17:13.588 --> 01:17:15.245
I hadn't really processed
the fact

1226
01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:17.882
that I'm gonna have to leave
this place soon.

1227
01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:21.302
I mean. so much has happened.
I don't. I don't know.

1228
01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:25.723
it. it's. um. it's difficult
to put into words.

1229
01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:28.976
You don't have to. I know.

1230
01:17:29.062 --> 01:17:33.263
Look. we've been close
for a long time.

1231
01:17:33.358 --> 01:17:37.193
And I thought I knew everything
there was to know about you.

1232
01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:40.529
But when I saw the way
you looked at Luke.

1233
01:17:40.615 --> 01:17:44.367
I realized I was only getting
half the story.

1234
01:17:44.452 --> 01:17:46.911
But if I know anything
about you. I know

1235
01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:49.664
that you're not gonna let Luke
get the final word.

1236
01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:55.795
Oh. you are so right.

1237
01:17:55.922 --> 01:17:57.588
I have a crazy idea.
and if we hurry.

1238
01:17:57.674 --> 01:17:59.757
I think there's still enough
time that we can pull this off.

1239
01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:01.842
I like where this is going.

1240
01:18:01.928 --> 01:18:03.928
But before we go. there's
someone I need to talk to.

1241
01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:08.298
I-it's an ambush!
Everybody retreat!

1242
01:18:08.393 --> 01:18:11.184
Retreat! Retreat.
retreat. retreat!

1243
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:13.478
-Brandon.

1244
01:18:21.072 --> 01:18:22.987
Chrissy.
you made me lose my game.

1245
01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:25.648
Oh. I'm sorry. I just needed
to get a hold of you

1246
01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:27.952
and I didn't know
of any other way.

1247
01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.577
Why didn't you just call
the house?

1248
01:18:29.664 --> 01:18:32.373
-Oh.
-Or even my cell.

1249
01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:35.166
Wait. why does a ten-year-old
have a cell phone?

1250
01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:37.503
Every ten-year-old
has a cell phone.

1251
01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:41.173
Wow! That's a lot to unpack
right now.

1252
01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:45.169
Okay. So I need you to help me
do something.

1253
01:18:45.263 --> 01:18:47.471
Remember when I helped you
get the girl?

1254
01:18:49.267 --> 01:18:50.850
Yeah.

1255
01:18:50.977 --> 01:18:53.728
Well. now I need you
to help me get the boy.

1256
01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:08.617
Oh. get up. Get up.

1257
01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:10.536
-We gotta go right away.
-Is everything okay?

1258
01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:12.663
I found this note
on Brandon's door.

1259
01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:15.541
He snuck out
to go to Chrissy's concert.

1260
01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:18.368
-What? Okay. come on. Let's go.
-I'll drive.

1261
01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:20.537
Okay. okay.
Let's go. let's go. let's go.

1262
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:22.298
Oh. that kid!

1263
01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.221
What are we doing here?
We need to get to the concert.

1264
01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:31.307
-And find Brandon.
-Brandon is fine.

1265
01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:33.434
Well. how would you know that?

1266
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:38.606
Well. what's goin' on?

1267
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:41.859
Grandma. please. what...
What are we doing here?

1268
01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:08.302
Uh...

1269
01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:13.264
Well. what are you.
what are you doing here?

1270
01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:15.309
You honored your end
of the deal.

1271
01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:17.228
I thought I better do the same.

1272
01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:21.982
But the concert?
I'm. I'm confused.

1273
01:20:22.068 --> 01:20:24.527
No. Just tweeted out
a change of venue.

1274
01:20:24.612 --> 01:20:26.862
I didn't see any reason
why we couldn't do a concert

1275
01:20:26.948 --> 01:20:29.824
and a Christmas party
at the same time.

1276
01:20:29.909 --> 01:20:32.201
-Of course you did.

1277
01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:35.454
Look...

1278
01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:40.166
I'm really. really sorry
I walked out on you last night.

1279
01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:41.460
Thank you.

1280
01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:43.379
I also didn't hold up

1281
01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:45.130
my end of the bargain.

1282
01:20:45.258 --> 01:20:46.924
I never finished your song.

1283
01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:51.387
Luke. what you wrote
was beautiful.

1284
01:20:51.472 --> 01:20:55.391
And. and without even
knowing it...

1285
01:20:56.227 --> 01:20:58.143
you gave me the ending.

1286
01:21:00.106 --> 01:21:04.108
-I don't understand.
-You were my first kiss. Luke.

1287
01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:05.818
And I was yours.

1288
01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:10.197
The past is where we started.

1289
01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:12.782
We're making new memories now.

1290
01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.245
You're not just my past.

1291
01:21:17.623 --> 01:21:21.876
Luke. you are my past
and my present

1292
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.710
and my whole future.

1293
01:21:24.964 --> 01:21:26.505
Oh. Chrissy...

1294
01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:30.092
I don't know what to say.

1295
01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:36.139
Say you'll get on stage
and play that song with me.

1296
01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:39.101
I'd love to.

1297
01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:41.978
Let's do this.

1298
01:21:46.986 --> 01:21:48.235
You ready?

1299
01:21:49.362 --> 01:21:50.404
Ready.

1300
01:21:52.032 --> 01:21:54.691
Hello. Cedar Pines!

1301
01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:01.916
It has been incredible to be
here with you this last week.

1302
01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:06.036
And. you know. sometimes in life
the gifts we receive

1303
01:22:06.130 --> 01:22:08.705
are the ones
we didn't even know we needed.

1304
01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:11.133
Aww...

1305
01:22:11.218 --> 01:22:13.877
Thank you for helping me
find my music again.

1306
01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:20.559
Are we ready to show 'em
how we do it back home?

1307
01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:24.103
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

1308
01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:27.543
That's my grandson up there!

1309
01:24:03.831 --> 01:24:05.822
You did it. Chrissy.

1310
01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:12.314
Thank you!

1311
01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:19.237
Thank you so much.

1312
01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:25.410
How'd we do?

1313
01:25:25.538 --> 01:25:28.496
I thank you
for letting me know right now.

1314
01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:30.999
Yeah.

1315
01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:32.876
Say. um...

1316
01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:38.257
What would you think about me
coming to live in Nashville?

1317
01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:43.594
Uh. what about Brandon?

1318
01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:47.516
Are you kidding?
Kid would follow you anywhere.

1319
01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:48.851
He's more obsessed with you
than I am.

1320
01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:57.192
If you're in Nashville.
then that's where I wanna be.

1321
01:25:57.278 --> 01:26:00.987
Home is wherever you are.
Chrissy.

1322
01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:05.242
Dang it. Luke.

1323
01:26:06.287 --> 01:26:07.577
Dang it what?

1324
01:26:09.415 --> 01:26:12.749
You always were the only boy
who could make me cry.

1325
01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.430
Oh. I'm not through
with you yet.

1326
01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:28.014
-Oh-ho?
-Yes!
