29
00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:21.500
Your exclusive sneak preview
of book two.

30
00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:24.133
You're the first
to ever hear it.

31
00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:30.800
I know. I know you're so eager
for the next book.

32
00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:32.333
but all I can say is...

33
00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.166
it's coming soon.

34
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.667
If I say any more.

35
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.467
that man over there.
my agent. Benny.

36
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.000
will yell at me.

37
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.266
She's right. I will.

38
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.767
But I'm not all bad.

39
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.500
because...

40
00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:47.900
I have
some very exciting news about

41
00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:49.767
the Isabella Christmas contest.

42
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.767
So many of you guys wrote in

43
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.367
and I'm thrilled to announce

44
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.867
that Sarah has chosen
a winning letter.

45
00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:57.734
She'll be traveling

46
00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.467
to the winner's home town
to announce their name.

47
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.266
so. people of...

48
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.100
New Britain. get ready.

49
00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.600
because Sarah Grace
is coming!

50
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.166
Wow.

51
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:12.400
New Britain? Maine?

52
00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.400
New Britain. Maine.

53
00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.934
Okay. if anybody wants
their book signed.

54
00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:19.066
come on up here!

55
00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:22.567
Hi!

56
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.900
What's your name?

57
00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.333
Thank you so much.
We had a blast.

58
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.133
Okay. I saw your face.
What's with New Britain?

59
00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:32.333
How big of a problem?

60
00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:33.834
Uh. it's kind of a big problem.

61
00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:35.367
New Britain is my hometown.

62
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.567
Sort of.

63
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.400
Well. you've never said
anything about this before.

64
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.033
Well. it ended badly.

65
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.133
How badly?

66
00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:44.266
Are you sure
you want to hear this?

67
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.100
Oh. I think I need to hear
every last juicy detail.

68
00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:49.667
It was Christmas...

69
00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:52.233
...and. like always.

70
00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:55.000
I went to my grandmother's
in New Britain.

71
00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:01.700
I was... a late bloomer.

72
00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:04.266
but I had a deep. deep crush
on the boy next door.

73
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.400
Ooh! I love
where this is going.

74
00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:12.066
Miss Raylene!
A kismet cookie?

75
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.300
I thought you were married.

76
00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:14.367
Wait! Wait. wait. wait.

77
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.800
Are you saying
kismet cookies are real?

78
00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:17.800
Benny...

79
00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:19.266
I'm telling you
this story once.

80
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.533
You can listen.
or you can interrupt.

81
00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:22.900
Sorry. sorry.
Keep going.

82
00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:25.834
I'll have you know.
this cookie is for my niece...

83
00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:27.066
who can't see a good man

84
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.266
if he's standing
right in front of her.

85
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.967
What Raylene means is.

86
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.100
she's sticking her nose where
it doesn't belong... again!

87
00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:36.500
What about you. Miss Patsy?
No cookie for you?

88
00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:37.567
Sarah Collins.

89
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.333
you just arrived.
and already with the sass?

90
00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:41.133
We missed you. Sarah.

91
00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:42.433
Now. get inside.

92
00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:44.400
Your Gramma Mia's been
baking all day.

93
00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:45.800
and she needs you.

94
00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.133
Okay.

95
00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:49.433
Hey!

96
00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:50.600
What?

97
00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:53.200
Sounds like you need
some silicone spray

98
00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:54.734
on those hinges.
Sarah-Bear.

99
00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:55.767
You know what?

100
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.200
You could stop calling me that
at any time.

101
00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:00.200
'cause I knew it was a dog.
not a bear.

102
00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:01.600
Oh. sure you did.

103
00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:03.533
That's why you broke
the land-speed record

104
00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:07.700
getting inside. screaming.
"Bear! Bear! Bear!"

105
00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:09.567
You done?

106
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.333
How's your best-seller going?

107
00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:16.033
Oh. it's...
you know. whatever. I...

108
00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:18.266
Well. if you need any help
brainstorming ideas.

109
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.133
you just holler at me. okay?

110
00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:22.000
Okay.

111
00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:23.300
Wait. no way!

112
00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:25.200
You're selling Night Runner?

113
00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:26.367
Yup.

114
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.700
Time to grow up.

115
00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.133
get something
a little more practical.

116
00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:31.934
You? Grow up?

117
00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:34.433
That'll be the day.

118
00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:36.100
Hey. Sarah-Bear.

119
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.900
I'm onto you.
Travis Walker!

120
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.300
Gramma Mia!

121
00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:53.133
Oh!

122
00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:55.734
- Hello!
- Oh. ho. ho!

123
00:04:56.633 --> 00:04:59.633
Welcome home. darling!
Oh.

124
00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:02.533
Oh!

125
00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:04.834
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh. Merry Christmas!

126
00:05:05.934 --> 00:05:07.600
Okay. well.
don't just stand there.

127
00:05:07.734 --> 00:05:10.266
Get yourself an apron
and help me with all of this.

128
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.600
- Okay.
- Oh!

129
00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:13.367
You can start
by taking those out

130
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.900
and put the fresh ones in.
- Okay.

131
00:05:15.834 --> 00:05:16.767
Have you called the police?

132
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.900
'Cause this place
looks like a crime scene.

133
00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:21.767
Oh. you know that it's only
on Christmas Eve

134
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.867
that my kitchen
looks like this.

135
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.033
Okay.

136
00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:28.266
How long
do I set the timer for?

137
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.834
Read the recipe!

138
00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:31.633
Oh.

139
00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:35.033
The recipe says "take them out
when they seem done."

140
00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:36.233
That's right.

141
00:05:36.367 --> 00:05:38.233
You know how this works.

142
00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:39.767
The kismet doesn't happen

143
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.000
unless you really believe
in the magic.

144
00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:45.533
Oh. no. no! Don't peek!

145
00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:48.266
Use your heart.
not your eyes.

146
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.200
Okay. Sorry.

147
00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.533
I saw Travis on my way in.

148
00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:54.734
Oh?
Did he tell you his news?

149
00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:56.867
Yeah. I can't believe
he's selling it.

150
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.533
That car's like his baby.

151
00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:02.800
I'll get it!

152
00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:04.333
Oh.

153
00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:10.867
Hi. I'm Helen.

154
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.900
Hi. I'm Mia.

155
00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:14.333
and this is
my granddaughter. Sarah.

156
00:06:14.467 --> 00:06:16.500
Are you here
for a kismet cookie?

157
00:06:16.633 --> 00:06:18.533
I guess so.

158
00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:20.800
My friend Angie says...

159
00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:22.066
I don't know.

160
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.800
I'm not a big believer
in this kinda stuff.

161
00:06:23.934 --> 00:06:26.467
Well. why don't
I tell you the legend.

162
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.567
and then you can decide
for yourself?

163
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.600
Okay? Come on in.

164
00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:32.767
So. a hundred years ago.

165
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.667
my great-grandparents
moved here.

166
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.433
and they bought this house.

167
00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:39.433
and before long.
there was a wealthy man in town

168
00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:41.567
who wanted to marry
their-their daughter...

169
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.300
my Nana Sue.

170
00:06:43.433 --> 00:06:46.734
Now. the man was very nice.
but Nana Sue didn't love him.

171
00:06:46.867 --> 00:06:49.667
And Nana Sue promised
her answer by Christmas.

172
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.066
and on Christmas Eve.

173
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.700
she bumped into this wall

174
00:06:52.834 --> 00:06:55.100
and discovered
this hidden cabinet.

175
00:06:55.233 --> 00:06:59.567
and. inside. she found
the recipe for kismet cookies.

176
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.066
It said. if you follow
the recipe exactly.

177
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.133
you'll dream of your true love.

178
00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:05.900
So she made the cookies.

179
00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:08.066
and wrapped one
and put it under her pillow.

180
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.800
just like
the recipe told her to.

181
00:07:09.934 --> 00:07:12.834
And that night. she dreamt
about the grocer in town

182
00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:14.467
who always made her laugh.

183
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.800
So the next morning.

184
00:07:15.934 --> 00:07:18.233
she marched into town
and she knocked on his door.

185
00:07:18.367 --> 00:07:20.600
and she wanted to know if
he had anything to say to her.

186
00:07:20.734 --> 00:07:23.066
and it turns out. he did.

187
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.400
He'd always loved her...

188
00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:25.967
...But he didn't think

189
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.734
he could compete
with the wealthy man.

190
00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:30.166
So. then. two weeks later.
they were married...

191
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.967
my Nana Sue and my Grampa Joe.

192
00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:37.700
And ever since then.
the cookies have worked.

193
00:07:37.834 --> 00:07:39.567
Okay.

194
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.633
I'm sold.

195
00:07:41.767 --> 00:07:43.500
It goes under my pillow?

196
00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:45.367
Uh-huh. Tonight.

197
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.900
You'll see.
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:08:09.567 --> 00:08:11.700
What's Travis
up to out there?

199
00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:13.233
Nothing. I don't know.

200
00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:14.867
Just. I guess fixing my car.

201
00:08:16.233 --> 00:08:20.400
Well. um. this is the last
kismet cookie of the year.

202
00:08:20.533 --> 00:08:22.467
Gramma!
Are you looking for love?

203
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.800
Oh! No. honey.

204
00:08:24.934 --> 00:08:28.834
No. you know your grandpop
was my one-and-done.

205
00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:31.300
The cookie just helps me
dream about him.

206
00:08:31.433 --> 00:08:33.433
I wish you'd let me try it.

207
00:08:33.567 --> 00:08:34.367
Oh...

208
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.600
I know you do. sweetheart. but...

209
00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:40.967
...it's too soon.

210
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.934
This is the time of your life

211
00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:44.700
when you should be writing
about crushes

212
00:08:44.834 --> 00:08:47.867
and sweeping romantic stories
in your journal.

213
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.400
Besides.
it doesn't matter.

214
00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:52.567
We've given away
all the other cookies.

215
00:08:55.066 --> 00:08:57.567
Tomorrow's Christmas!

216
00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:00.900
Oh! Sarah! Merry Christmas.

217
00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.000
What would you
like for breakfast?

218
00:10:02.133 --> 00:10:03.233
I can make you...

219
00:10:03.367 --> 00:10:05.867
Don't be mad. but I saved
a kismet cookie for myself.

220
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.700
I put it under my pillow
last night...

221
00:10:08.834 --> 00:10:10.867
...and I know
who my true love is.

222
00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:15.266
Oh. Sarah. Sarah. wait!

223
00:10:23.834 --> 00:10:24.834
Travis.

224
00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:26.367
Hey. Sarah.
what are you doing here?

225
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.166
I need to tell you something.

226
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.133
Can it wait?

227
00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:31.200
You know the kismet cookies?

228
00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:32.066
Yeah.

229
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.033
Yeah. well. last night.

230
00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:34.333
I put one under my pillow.

231
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.834
I know I wasn't supposed to.
but I did.

232
00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:37.967
and I dreamt about you...

233
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.367
and that means
that you're my true love.

234
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.667
and we're supposed
to be together.

235
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.066
and I know how that sounds.
but I...

236
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.800
You're getting married?

237
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.467
Yeah...

238
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.867
Look. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

239
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.166
but... this is a good day
for me. okay?

240
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.633
B-Be happy for me.
Sarah?

241
00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:01.033
Sarah!

242
00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:07.967
I'm sorry. honey.

243
00:11:11.633 --> 00:11:12.467
Oh!

244
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.100
Sarah. I-I understand.
I do.

245
00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:18.333
And I hate that
it broke your heart. but...

246
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.633
...be absolutely sure

247
00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:22.333
that you don't believe
in the kismet anymore

248
00:11:22.467 --> 00:11:24.200
before you do that.

249
00:11:37.066 --> 00:11:39.200
So kismet cookies are real?

250
00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:40.934
No. Clearly. they're not.

251
00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:43.066
It's a fairytale
I believed in as a kid.

252
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.066
and it gave me the idea
for the book.

253
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.033
but instead of predicting love.
in the book.

254
00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:48.934
the cookies turn you
into a mini-superhero.

255
00:11:49.066 --> 00:11:50.867
'Cause that's what I needed
to be at the time...

256
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.266
strong and confident.

257
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.934
So what happened?

258
00:11:54.066 --> 00:11:56.033
The next time you saw
the boy next door?

259
00:11:56.166 --> 00:11:57.333
Oh. I didn't.

260
00:11:57.467 --> 00:12:00.200
My dad got there soon after.
I begged him to take me away.

261
00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:01.934
so we went to a ski lodge.

262
00:12:02.066 --> 00:12:04.500
Gramma Mia says they moved
to Florida a few years ago.

263
00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:07.266
And you haven't been back
to New Britain since?

264
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.300
No.

265
00:12:09.433 --> 00:12:12.033
Okay. As your agent.
I'm going to advise you

266
00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:14.700
never to tell this version
of the kismet story to anyone.

267
00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:17.333
Can we please pick
a new winner?

268
00:12:17.467 --> 00:12:18.900
No. It's too late.

269
00:12:19.033 --> 00:12:20.500
We've already told
the mayor of the town.

270
00:12:20.633 --> 00:12:21.500
and he wants to announce it

271
00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:23.133
at some "Christmas in the Park"
thing.

272
00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:24.333
Dickens.

273
00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:25.166
Huh?

274
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.300
"Dickens in the Park."

275
00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:27.967
A Christmas Carol?
Dickens?

276
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.800
New Britain? Get it?
Everyone dresses up!

277
00:12:30.934 --> 00:12:32.266
- Love that.
- Wait.

278
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.533
Do they know that
Sarah Grace the author

279
00:12:34.667 --> 00:12:36.934
is really Sarah Collins?

280
00:12:37.066 --> 00:12:40.133
Well. I haven't told anyone.
so. unless Gramma Mia has...

281
00:12:40.266 --> 00:12:42.467
Gramma Mia doesn't tell anyone
anything. clearly.

282
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.166
Perfect!
So there's no problem.

283
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.867
You... can go do
the Dickens thing on Saturday.

284
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.834
you can head over
to Gramma Mia's place.

285
00:12:50.967 --> 00:12:52.834
lock yourself in.
she can feed you.

286
00:12:52.967 --> 00:12:55.500
and you can crank out
book number two.

287
00:12:55.633 --> 00:12:59.000
I know. I know.
First draft by January third.

288
00:12:59.133 --> 00:13:00.600
Don't make it
sound unreasonable. my friend.

289
00:13:00.734 --> 00:13:03.500
They have given you
two very generous extensions.

290
00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:05.367
And I'm close. I swear!

291
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.400
I'm 80% done.

292
00:13:06.533 --> 00:13:07.667
I just...

293
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.000
need to figure out the ending.

294
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.233
Sarah. is that you?

295
00:13:48.834 --> 00:13:50.166
Oh. my gosh!

296
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.467
Welcome home.

297
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.000
Thank you.

298
00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:54.633
And thanks again
for keeping this low-key.

299
00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.000
What?

300
00:13:56.133 --> 00:13:57.533
What?
- Is that our girl?

301
00:13:57.667 --> 00:14:00.133
Oh. look at you!

302
00:14:00.266 --> 00:14:01.800
It's so many years! Oh. my g...

303
00:14:01.934 --> 00:14:03.600
You've got to come
by the candy shop

304
00:14:03.734 --> 00:14:05.300
and see all the changes I made.

305
00:14:05.433 --> 00:14:07.900
And I haven't been able
to tell any of my customers

306
00:14:08.033 --> 00:14:10.533
I know the great Sarah Grace.

307
00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:12.567
- Oh...
- And you know how hard it is

308
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.100
for me to keep a secret.

309
00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:15.533
I've been in such a state!

310
00:14:15.667 --> 00:14:18.400
You. I mean...

311
00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:29.633
It's officially a time capsule.

312
00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:53.100
Sarah! Get dressed.
We're leaving soon.

313
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.533
Here we go.

314
00:14:56.667 --> 00:14:59.133
Oh. my gosh. Oh. wow!

315
00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:01.000
Oh. it looks incredible.

316
00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:03.600
It's exactly the same.

317
00:15:03.734 --> 00:15:05.200
We're here!

318
00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:07.600
We couldn't get my hat
to stay on!

319
00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:09.867
It kept flying off
like a Frisbee.

320
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.667
So. are you ready
for this?

321
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.967
Me? No. I'm never ready. No.

322
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.200
But my alter-ego Sarah Grace
is just fine.

323
00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:18.166
Which reminds me.

324
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.867
I need to take a photo
for Benny.

325
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.600
- Oh!
- Everybody. get in!

326
00:15:21.734 --> 00:15:24.767
Patsy... get in there!

327
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.967
Thank you. Perfect.

328
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.333
Okay.

329
00:15:29.467 --> 00:15:30.967
Is that Mayor Schebly?

330
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.967
Oh. yes. That's our mayor.

331
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.300
Right. Patsy?

332
00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:40.867
Hello. hello. hello.
ladies and gents!

333
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.967
Okay.

334
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.367
Cover me.
I'm going in.

335
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.600
Okay.

336
00:15:45.734 --> 00:15:47.533
Merry Christmas!

337
00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:50.433
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for...

338
00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:52.000
here she comes...

339
00:15:52.133 --> 00:15:53.734
Sarah Grace.

340
00:15:53.867 --> 00:15:57.033
author of
Isabella's Kismet Cookies!

341
00:15:59.133 --> 00:16:02.233
We are so excited to have you
here in New Britain.

342
00:16:02.367 --> 00:16:03.400
And you came all dressed up!

343
00:16:03.533 --> 00:16:04.867
Of course!

344
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.467
Thank you so much
for the warm welcome.

345
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.700
I'm so pleased to be here.

346
00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:10.333
Ooh...

347
00:16:10.467 --> 00:16:12.266
is that...
what I think it is?

348
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.700
It is.

349
00:16:13.834 --> 00:16:16.500
As you know. children
from all over the country

350
00:16:16.633 --> 00:16:17.734
wrote in.

351
00:16:17.867 --> 00:16:20.700
telling me about projects
they wanted to do

352
00:16:20.834 --> 00:16:23.000
that reflected
Isabella's spirit...

353
00:16:23.133 --> 00:16:25.066
and the winner's name

354
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.133
is in this envelope.

355
00:16:27.266 --> 00:16:29.100
Would you do the honors?

356
00:16:29.233 --> 00:16:31.700
I would love to.

357
00:16:31.834 --> 00:16:33.800
Ahem! Are you ready?

358
00:16:35.734 --> 00:16:37.934
And the winner is...

359
00:16:39.033 --> 00:16:40.767
Jasmine Walker!
- Yes!

360
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.400
Come on over here!

361
00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:46.200
Hi. Jasmine!

362
00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:47.734
I loved your letter.

363
00:16:47.867 --> 00:16:49.734
and your book project
sounds like it embodies

364
00:16:49.867 --> 00:16:52.000
everything
I hoped Isabella would mean

365
00:16:52.133 --> 00:16:53.433
for kids your age.

366
00:16:53.567 --> 00:16:55.433
I love you so much!

367
00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:58.133
Jazzy's...

368
00:16:58.266 --> 00:16:59.600
Jazzy's had
her fingers crossed

369
00:16:59.734 --> 00:17:02.333
ever since we found out
the winner was from New Britain.

370
00:17:02.467 --> 00:17:05.100
Father Christmas
is my dad.

371
00:17:06.433 --> 00:17:08.100
Sarah Grace. Jazzy.

372
00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:09.834
would you be willing
to pose for a picture

373
00:17:09.967 --> 00:17:11.467
for our local paper?

374
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.734
Of course!

375
00:17:12.867 --> 00:17:14.767
Jasmine... wait.
do you go by "Jazzy"?

376
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.767
Yeah.

377
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.100
Well. you first. Jazzy.

378
00:17:17.233 --> 00:17:19.333
Come on! Let's go!

379
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.667
Okay...

380
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.166
settle in...

381
00:17:38.467 --> 00:17:40.767
All right. camera's over here.
Father Christmas. okay?

382
00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.500
All right. and everybody say
"Merry Christmas!"

383
00:17:44.633 --> 00:17:46.667
Merry Christmas!

384
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.767
Yes!

385
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.900
Thank you. Sarah Grace.
and thank you. Jazzy.

386
00:17:51.033 --> 00:17:52.967
Good job. Jazzy.

387
00:17:56.433 --> 00:17:58.133
Oh. thank you. thank you.

388
00:17:58.266 --> 00:17:59.567
I remember that smile.

389
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.033
Hey. Sarah-Bear.

390
00:18:10.266 --> 00:18:11.333
Sarah?

391
00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:12.433
Sarah...

392
00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:14.834
Oh! Sarah. please don't leave.

393
00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:15.967
Oh...

394
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.900
you said
you'd stay for Christmas.

395
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.967
And you said
they were in Florida!

396
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.000
No. I said Mr. and Mrs. Walker
were in Florida.

397
00:18:23.133 --> 00:18:25.500
Can you split that hair
any finer?

398
00:18:25.633 --> 00:18:26.667
Uh...

399
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.333
Sarah... Sarah. I-I realize
you're still upset.

400
00:18:29.467 --> 00:18:31.834
but. darling.
it was a lifetime ago.

401
00:18:31.967 --> 00:18:33.800
If it makes you feel better.

402
00:18:33.934 --> 00:18:37.333
Mia didn't even tell me
about the wedding either.

403
00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:39.467
I get not telling Raylene.
but me? Ha!

404
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.934
Say what. now?

405
00:18:41.066 --> 00:18:42.266
Sarah. wait.

406
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.433
It was Travis's story to tell.
and he should have told you.

407
00:18:45.567 --> 00:18:46.800
He had a lot on his mind.

408
00:18:46.934 --> 00:18:48.233
and probably had no idea

409
00:18:48.367 --> 00:18:50.367
you were nursing
a little crush on him.

410
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.667
- Okay...
- And. plus.

411
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.300
I didn't expect you
to hide that cookie. a-and...

412
00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:54.433
Well...

413
00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:56.000
It's all in the past. darling.
and this year.

414
00:18:56.133 --> 00:18:57.033
more than any other year.

415
00:18:57.166 --> 00:18:58.734
I want to have Christmas
in this house.

416
00:18:58.867 --> 00:19:01.333
W-What do you mean.
"more than any other year"?

417
00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:03.233
Come in!

418
00:19:03.367 --> 00:19:05.033
Sarah!

419
00:19:05.166 --> 00:19:06.567
Oh!

420
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.166
Where'd you go so fast?

421
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.300
I can't believe
we're neighbors.

422
00:19:10.433 --> 00:19:12.000
We are?

423
00:19:12.133 --> 00:19:13.066
Wow.

424
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.967
Oh. that's news to me too.

425
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:16.633
Yeah. I bought the place
from my parents

426
00:19:16.767 --> 00:19:17.667
when they retired.

427
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.600
It's just the easiest thing
for all of us.

428
00:19:19.734 --> 00:19:20.734
Right.

429
00:19:20.867 --> 00:19:24.166
Is that yours?
Are you leaving already?

430
00:19:25.533 --> 00:19:26.667
Um...

431
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.467
No. No. Um. I...

432
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.066
I... haven't unpacked yet.

433
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.066
Yeah. I have to carry this upstairs.

434
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.200
I can help you.

435
00:19:38.333 --> 00:19:39.533
Oh! You... I...

436
00:19:39.667 --> 00:19:40.967
Okay. Jazzy. Jazzy.
I got that.

437
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.734
You take the little one.
There you go.

438
00:19:43.867 --> 00:19:45.867
This is really unnecessary.

439
00:19:51.867 --> 00:19:54.233
Okay.

440
00:19:54.367 --> 00:19:56.934
Roasted chestnuts
still your favorite?

441
00:19:58.166 --> 00:19:59.900
They are. Thank you.

442
00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:03.133
Go ahead. You can ask her.

443
00:20:03.266 --> 00:20:04.600
Ask me what?

444
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.367
Would you help me
with a book project?

445
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:08.734
The one
that I wrote to you about?

446
00:20:08.867 --> 00:20:10.233
Books for kids?

447
00:20:10.367 --> 00:20:12.533
That's one of
my favorite things.

448
00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:14.433
I go to the library
every week.

449
00:20:14.567 --> 00:20:16.266
Did you used to go there
when you lived here?

450
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400
The library?

451
00:20:17.533 --> 00:20:19.033
All the time.

452
00:20:19.166 --> 00:20:20.233
But I didn't live here. Jazzy.

453
00:20:20.367 --> 00:20:22.500
I just visited for Christmas
and in the summers.

454
00:20:22.633 --> 00:20:24.533
I stayed here with Gramma Mia.

455
00:20:24.667 --> 00:20:27.000
and because she was a teacher.
we had the same time off.

456
00:20:27.133 --> 00:20:28.300
Where was your mom?

457
00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:31.200
She died
when I was very young.

458
00:20:32.667 --> 00:20:33.700
Jazzy?

459
00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:35.200
Remember
that conversation we had

460
00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:38.133
about other people's business
not really being yours?

461
00:20:38.266 --> 00:20:40.000
Sorry.

462
00:20:40.133 --> 00:20:41.233
That's okay.

463
00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:43.066
Hey. Do you want to show me
the way to your project?

464
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.200
Yeah.

465
00:20:48.266 --> 00:20:50.200
When you were little. did you
and my dad play together?

466
00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:51.200
Sometimes.

467
00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.100
but your dad
is a lot older than I am.

468
00:20:53.233 --> 00:20:55.200
Four years is not a lot older!

469
00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:56.233
It's a lot.

470
00:20:56.367 --> 00:20:57.800
He looks way older than you.

471
00:20:57.934 --> 00:20:59.033
He does. doesn't he?

472
00:20:59.166 --> 00:21:00.934
But. to be fair.
the beard isn't helping.

473
00:21:01.066 --> 00:21:03.033
Yeah.

474
00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:06.967
Too early for wine?

475
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.967
That's a rhetorical question. right?

476
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.800
Red. or white. or...

477
00:21:10.934 --> 00:21:12.834
both.
- Yeah.

478
00:21:13.767 --> 00:21:15.667
Come on.
Everything's in here.

479
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.000
Sarah?

480
00:21:17.133 --> 00:21:18.333
Um...

481
00:21:20.567 --> 00:21:22.100
Nice save with the suitcase...

482
00:21:23.667 --> 00:21:24.533
but I get it.

483
00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.433
I don't blame you
for wanting to leave.

484
00:21:26.567 --> 00:21:29.867
I'm sure this was all
a bit of a surprise to you.

485
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.834
But thank you for staying.

486
00:21:31.967 --> 00:21:33.467
It means a lot.

487
00:21:34.834 --> 00:21:36.767
To Jazzy.

488
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.834
Mm.

489
00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:42.900
Jazzy's mom?

490
00:21:43.033 --> 00:21:44.200
Oh... well...

491
00:21:44.333 --> 00:21:46.033
Come on. you two!

492
00:21:46.166 --> 00:21:47.166
Okay! Just a second!

493
00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.700
Just gotta get out of

494
00:21:48.834 --> 00:21:51.133
these scratchy
Father Christmas duds.

495
00:22:02.967 --> 00:22:05.133
What? Don't look at me
like that.

496
00:22:05.266 --> 00:22:07.100
Let me try it.

497
00:22:07.233 --> 00:22:09.300
How do I look?

498
00:22:11.133 --> 00:22:14.300
What do you think?
Runway model. hmm?

499
00:22:14.433 --> 00:22:16.266
Gorgeous.

500
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.700
Oh. it looks better
on you. even.

501
00:22:19.834 --> 00:22:20.800
Daddy. when you were little.

502
00:22:20.934 --> 00:22:22.667
did you really
let a skunk in the house?

503
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.667
I sure did.
Right through the front door.

504
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.367
Why?

505
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.433
Beats me.

506
00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:30.834
Who knows why
eight-year-old boys do anything.

507
00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:32.467
The skunk
was on the front porch.

508
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.700
I opened the door.

509
00:22:33.834 --> 00:22:35.100
he strolled right in.

510
00:22:35.233 --> 00:22:36.367
And that skunk

511
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.867
was the worst thing
I've ever smelled

512
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
in my entire life.

513
00:22:40.133 --> 00:22:41.633
But that wasn't our only
close encounter with nature.

514
00:22:41.767 --> 00:22:43.266
was it. Sarah-Bear?

515
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.233
Why do you call her that?

516
00:22:45.367 --> 00:22:46.800
Hey! Let's work
on your project first.

517
00:22:46.934 --> 00:22:49.033
and then we can tell
more embarrassing stories.

518
00:22:50.633 --> 00:22:53.367
Okay! If I remember
from your letter.

519
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.266
your project makes it easy

520
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.200
for families
to donate books at Christmas.

521
00:22:57.333 --> 00:22:59.166
Yep. It's called
"Let's Read at Christmas."

522
00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.033
- Good name!
- The kids of New Britain

523
00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:03.667
donate books to kids
from our sister city.

524
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.700
who aren't as lucky.

525
00:23:04.834 --> 00:23:06.600
They don't have
a huge library like we do.

526
00:23:06.734 --> 00:23:09.400
And what are these ornaments
we're cutting out?

527
00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:10.767
Kids decorate them.

528
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.934
and put the name of
their gift book on the back.

529
00:23:13.066 --> 00:23:14.700
And then they hang them
on the Christmas tree

530
00:23:14.834 --> 00:23:15.767
in the community center.

531
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.433
Families can pick one.

532
00:23:17.567 --> 00:23:18.600
Or two.

533
00:23:18.734 --> 00:23:19.667
Or three!

534
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.867
And buy the book to donate.

535
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.533
The books get wrapped
and donated on Christmas Eve.

536
00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:25.667
And who's wrapping
all these books?

537
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.767
Well. Jazzy is very good
at volunteering my time.

538
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.934
No. I noticed that.
Father Christmas.

539
00:23:31.066 --> 00:23:32.333
Exactly.

540
00:23:32.467 --> 00:23:33.600
And where are you
getting all the books?

541
00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:34.667
Are you working
with Miss Raylene?

542
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.567
Mm-hmm. Miss Raylene's
already picked up

543
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.000
a bunch of
the most popular titles.

544
00:23:38.133 --> 00:23:39.100
and she'll grab some more

545
00:23:39.233 --> 00:23:41.100
once she finds out
what the kids ask for.

546
00:23:41.233 --> 00:23:43.266
She's selling them all at cost.
which is great. so...

547
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.900
Well. I can talk to
my agent. Benny.

548
00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:48.233
I'm sure he can overnight
a stack of books.

549
00:23:48.367 --> 00:23:50.467
Really? That would be great.

550
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.266
Well. it's good to be
Sarah Grace.

551
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.166
Do the book people
know your real name?

552
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.500
They do.

553
00:23:56.633 --> 00:23:59.433
But why do you use Sarah Grace
instead of Sarah Collins?

554
00:23:59.567 --> 00:24:02.333
Oh. Um. well.
when people ask me that.

555
00:24:02.467 --> 00:24:06.000
I tell them that Sarah Grace
just sounds more...

556
00:24:06.133 --> 00:24:07.300
elegant.

557
00:24:07.433 --> 00:24:09.300
but the truth is.

558
00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:12.133
I first had the idea
for the book when I was only 17.

559
00:24:12.266 --> 00:24:14.600
and I was very...

560
00:24:14.734 --> 00:24:15.900
awkward?

561
00:24:16.033 --> 00:24:17.066
No.

562
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.600
And very lonely. and...

563
00:24:20.734 --> 00:24:22.533
I just wanted
to be someone else...

564
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.767
...someone who went through life

565
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.667
with a lot more grace
than I did.

566
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.233
so I created an alter ego

567
00:24:28.367 --> 00:24:30.800
so I could pretend to be someone
who was confident

568
00:24:30.934 --> 00:24:33.600
and funny and graceful...

569
00:24:33.734 --> 00:24:36.500
and just not at all lonely.

570
00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:39.600
But why were you lonely?

571
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.767
A... a lot of reasons.

572
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.066
But here's the funny part.

573
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.600
It all worked out.

574
00:24:46.734 --> 00:24:47.467
And without it.

575
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.000
I never would've
written Isabella.

576
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.200
up. Benny.

577
00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:02.400
So the boy next door
is still next door?

578
00:25:02.533 --> 00:25:05.066
Is he still
breathtakingly handsome?

579
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.900
Even more so.

580
00:25:07.033 --> 00:25:09.133
Oh. and you'll never guess
who his daughter is.

581
00:25:09.266 --> 00:25:10.333
Stop.

582
00:25:10.467 --> 00:25:12.166
The contest winner?

583
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.667
Ding-ding-ding!

584
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.900
Of course she is.

585
00:25:15.033 --> 00:25:17.934
Well. this just gets better
and better.

586
00:25:18.066 --> 00:25:20.066
I'm gonna need to see pictures.

587
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.100
No. I cannot make that promise.

588
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.567
All right. I gotta go.

589
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.300
All right.
Well. I'm here if you need me.

590
00:25:26.433 --> 00:25:27.233
Bye.

591
00:25:28.467 --> 00:25:31.000
Would you like to stop
at Patsy's shop with me?

592
00:25:31.133 --> 00:25:33.066
Is that even a question?

593
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.900
Ho. ho.

594
00:25:39.467 --> 00:25:42.266
Oh. it looks exactly the same!

595
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.467
Mm-hmm.

596
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.934
And everything tastes
just as good as it always did.

597
00:25:46.066 --> 00:25:48.266
Well. I don't know
if I trust you on that.

598
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.467
I think further testing
might be required.

599
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.600
Chocolate peppermint fudge.

600
00:25:55.734 --> 00:25:58.066
I tweaked my recipe
last Christmas.

601
00:25:59.133 --> 00:26:00.233
Mm!

602
00:26:01.867 --> 00:26:03.567
This one may be
my favorite yet!

603
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.500
Oh. ho. Darling. you have
said that about every one.

604
00:26:06.633 --> 00:26:07.867
And I've meant it!

605
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.300
Miss Patsy.
nothing compares to your candy.

606
00:26:11.433 --> 00:26:13.700
Come on. spill.
What's your secret?

607
00:26:13.834 --> 00:26:14.800
Oh. that's easy.

608
00:26:14.934 --> 00:26:16.367
I use the best chocolate.

609
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.333
real vanilla.

610
00:26:17.467 --> 00:26:20.633
and. of course.
my secret ingredient.

611
00:26:20.767 --> 00:26:22.233
What's your secret ingredient?

612
00:26:24.133 --> 00:26:25.000
Love.

613
00:26:25.133 --> 00:26:26.300
"Love"?

614
00:26:27.934 --> 00:26:28.800
That's your secret?

615
00:26:28.934 --> 00:26:29.667
Yes.

616
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.133
Love.

617
00:26:31.266 --> 00:26:33.166
When people cook
or bake these days.

618
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.633
they've gotta do it
as fast as possible

619
00:26:35.767 --> 00:26:37.133
so they can
get to the 20 other things

620
00:26:37.266 --> 00:26:38.734
that need doing. right?

621
00:26:38.867 --> 00:26:40.333
But not Patsy.

622
00:26:40.467 --> 00:26:41.900
She has
a close personal relationship

623
00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:43.200
with everything she makes.

624
00:26:43.333 --> 00:26:44.533
Especially the fudge.

625
00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:47.567
Well. there is love
in this cookies-and-cream.

626
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.033
I can tell you that.

627
00:26:49.166 --> 00:26:50.333
Believe me...

628
00:26:50.467 --> 00:26:53.066
if there's love.
there's no magic. honey.

629
00:26:54.633 --> 00:26:56.467
Just like the kismet cookies...

630
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.033
well. that and the fact
that there's. you know.

631
00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:01.800
something a little mysterious
about you Collins women.

632
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.600
Or maybe
magic just doesn't exist.

633
00:27:07.367 --> 00:27:08.867
Honey. just because
you had a dud batch

634
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.734
doesn't mean that other people
haven't found true love.

635
00:27:11.867 --> 00:27:13.433
Maybe you were just too young.

636
00:27:13.567 --> 00:27:14.867
or maybe...

637
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.734
because you weren't exactly
honest with your gramma.

638
00:27:17.867 --> 00:27:20.467
you neutralized
the magic somehow.

639
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.633
Well. whatever happened.
it's gone now.

640
00:27:22.767 --> 00:27:27.166
So. uh. you two ready to meet
Raylene for a little tea time?

641
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.433
Mm-hmm!

642
00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:29.967
"God bless us. everyone."

643
00:27:31.567 --> 00:27:32.900
- Very Dickens.
- Classic.

644
00:27:33.033 --> 00:27:34.734
All right. ladies.

645
00:27:34.867 --> 00:27:35.934
Let's hear it.

646
00:27:36.066 --> 00:27:39.066
What is the dumbest thing
you ever did for love?

647
00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.700
Sarah. you can sit this one out.

648
00:27:40.834 --> 00:27:43.033
because we already know
about you already.

649
00:27:43.166 --> 00:27:45.767
Oh. everyone's favorite
wedding crasher. that's me.

650
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.100
- Oh...
- Okay.

651
00:27:47.233 --> 00:27:49.166
I went up to a boy
that I barely knew.

652
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.400
in front of his friends.

653
00:27:50.533 --> 00:27:53.433
and I told him
that he's gonna marry me

654
00:27:53.567 --> 00:27:56.133
because I put a cookie
under my pillow

655
00:27:56.266 --> 00:27:58.033
and then
I had a dream about him.

656
00:27:58.166 --> 00:27:59.233
- Oh...
- Gramma.

657
00:27:59.367 --> 00:28:01.700
that same move
didn't exactly work for me.

658
00:28:01.834 --> 00:28:04.000
Well. these cookies
don't come with a guarantee.

659
00:28:04.133 --> 00:28:06.867
I don't think I've ever done
anything really stupid for love.

660
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.700
What?

661
00:28:08.834 --> 00:28:12.100
Don't worry about that.
There's still time.

662
00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:14.500
Hello. ladies. Ahem.

663
00:28:14.633 --> 00:28:15.967
- Oh!
- Hi.

664
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.500
Speak of the devil.

665
00:28:17.633 --> 00:28:18.533
Sarah Grace...

666
00:28:18.667 --> 00:28:20.533
you're just
who I've been looking for.

667
00:28:20.667 --> 00:28:22.367
I come. hat in hand.

668
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.800
to ask if you would mind

669
00:28:23.934 --> 00:28:26.166
being part of our holiday
scavenger hunt tomorrow.

670
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.500
Scavenger hunt?

671
00:28:27.633 --> 00:28:30.100
Oh. yes! You could be
the answer to one of the clues!

672
00:28:30.233 --> 00:28:31.500
Yeah!
- People get a list

673
00:28:31.633 --> 00:28:33.033
of riddles to solve.

674
00:28:33.166 --> 00:28:35.266
and then they take a picture
of the answer.

675
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.600
and the first person to take
all the correct photos wins.

676
00:28:37.734 --> 00:28:40.533
Fun! I'd love to help.
Where should I hide?

677
00:28:40.667 --> 00:28:43.266
Well. my bookstore
isn't on the list yet.

678
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.000
Perfect.

679
00:28:45.133 --> 00:28:46.467
Can you be there at ten?

680
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.333
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

681
00:28:48.467 --> 00:28:50.633
Oh. Albert. before I forget...

682
00:28:50.767 --> 00:28:53.633
I've got your favorite...
cookies and cream.

683
00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:55.533
Thank you.

684
00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:56.633
That's. uh...

685
00:28:58.667 --> 00:29:01.500
I really need to figure out
a way to pay you back

686
00:29:01.633 --> 00:29:02.867
for all the sweets
you give me.

687
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.834
Oh!

688
00:29:03.967 --> 00:29:05.934
Maybe you could invite her
to dinner.

689
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.533
All righty. then!

690
00:29:12.667 --> 00:29:15.333
See you
at the scavenger hunt tomorrow.

691
00:29:15.467 --> 00:29:17.200
See you.

692
00:29:17.333 --> 00:29:18.266
Oh!

693
00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.700
You guys!

694
00:29:19.834 --> 00:29:20.867
Stop it.

695
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.600
We have a definite "maybe"!

696
00:29:23.734 --> 00:29:24.500
To the dinner!

697
00:29:24.633 --> 00:29:26.433
- Dinner!
- To the dinner.

698
00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:31.667
In my defense. Jazzy.

699
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.133
it was very dark.

700
00:29:33.266 --> 00:29:35.100
and Boomer was
a large black dog.

701
00:29:35.233 --> 00:29:36.867
so he looked just like a bear.

702
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.066
and he was running
directly towards me.

703
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.367
Jazzy.

704
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.200
I have seen
Olympic-qualifying track meets

705
00:29:42.333 --> 00:29:44.567
where people did not run
as fast as Sarah did. okay?

706
00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:46.567
Is that where you got the idea

707
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.166
for the bear character in
Isabella?

708
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.667
It sure is.

709
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.767
I can't wait for you to finish
the next Isabella book.

710
00:29:53.734 --> 00:29:55.600
You and me both.

711
00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:57.433
Hey.

712
00:29:57.567 --> 00:29:58.767
Who's that?

713
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.867
She's new in town.
I'm gonna go say hi.

714
00:30:03.633 --> 00:30:04.367
Do you know who that is?

715
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.433
You don't suppose

716
00:30:05.567 --> 00:30:06.900
she's telling her
that I'm Sarah Grace

717
00:30:07.033 --> 00:30:08.567
and my grandmother
lives across the street?

718
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.667
Probably...

719
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.533
seeing as how she's told
everybody else in town.

720
00:30:13.633 --> 00:30:16.734
You know. maybe you should
start wearing sunglasses

721
00:30:16.867 --> 00:30:18.000
and then...

722
00:30:18.133 --> 00:30:20.066
I can walk in front of you
and be like...

723
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.266
"Excuse me. excuse me.

724
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.700
Miss Sarah Grace has no comment
at this time."

725
00:30:24.834 --> 00:30:26.433
That would be perfect.

726
00:30:26.567 --> 00:30:27.567
That'll be really good.

727
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.934
Okay.

728
00:30:34.033 --> 00:30:37.934
So. Jazzy has been
writing Isabella stories.

729
00:30:38.066 --> 00:30:39.033
Dad!

730
00:30:39.166 --> 00:30:40.100
What?

731
00:30:40.233 --> 00:30:41.734
Look. I'm just glad

732
00:30:41.867 --> 00:30:43.600
that someone's giving
Isabella some new adventures.

733
00:30:43.734 --> 00:30:44.900
Is that okay?

734
00:30:45.033 --> 00:30:46.533
To write stories?

735
00:30:46.667 --> 00:30:48.900
I mean.
no one else reads them.

736
00:30:49.033 --> 00:30:51.533
Of course!
It's called "fan fiction."

737
00:30:51.667 --> 00:30:53.900
I used to write a lot of it
when I was your age.

738
00:30:54.033 --> 00:30:55.533
especially about
my favorite book.

739
00:30:55.667 --> 00:30:57.500
A Wrinkle In Time.

740
00:30:57.633 --> 00:30:59.600
Sorry.
how do you remember that?

741
00:30:59.734 --> 00:31:01.633
I was your sounding board. remember?

742
00:31:01.767 --> 00:31:03.700
Well. yeah!

743
00:31:04.734 --> 00:31:07.066
When Sarah would get stuck.
we'd go to the end of the pier

744
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.667
and just talk the story out.

745
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.333
We spent a lot of time brainstorming.

746
00:31:11.467 --> 00:31:13.967
Did you help
write the stories?

747
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.467
Me? No. no.

748
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.967
I just listened.

749
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.133
That's not true.

750
00:31:18.266 --> 00:31:19.633
You gave suggestions sometimes.

751
00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:21.066
Yeah. but you would never
take them.

752
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.567
Well. I didn't say
they were good suggestions.

753
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.000
- Hey...
- Wait.

754
00:31:25.133 --> 00:31:27.066
How do you know
that I never took them?

755
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.600
Because I read every single one
of your stories.

756
00:31:29.734 --> 00:31:30.934
What?

757
00:31:31.066 --> 00:31:32.433
Yeah. don't you remember?

758
00:31:32.567 --> 00:31:35.734
You kept 'em in a notebook
in that tree in the backyard.

759
00:31:35.867 --> 00:31:37.233
You mean the book marked

760
00:31:37.367 --> 00:31:40.100
"Private. keep out...
especially Travis"?

761
00:31:40.233 --> 00:31:42.166
That's the one.

762
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.834
I thought you meant
some other Travis!

763
00:31:44.967 --> 00:31:45.967
Oh.

764
00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.400
Oh. I see. Uh-huh.

765
00:31:51.734 --> 00:31:54.266
Sarah. are you coming
to the scavenger hunt tomorrow?

766
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.834
Well. I'm in
the scavenger hunt.

767
00:31:55.967 --> 00:31:57.066
so I'll see you there.

768
00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.166
If you can find me.

769
00:32:00.266 --> 00:32:02.400
All right. kiddo.
it's getting pretty late.

770
00:32:02.533 --> 00:32:04.200
Why don't you head home.
get into some PJs.

771
00:32:04.333 --> 00:32:05.700
and I'll be right there. okay?

772
00:32:05.834 --> 00:32:07.000
Can we have book time?

773
00:32:08.133 --> 00:32:09.734
One chapter.

774
00:32:11.533 --> 00:32:13.734
Look both ways when
you're crossing the street.

775
00:32:13.867 --> 00:32:15.867
Got it. Dad.
You say that every time!

776
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.667
When she started
reading on her own.

777
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.900
we kinda missed
our nightly book time.

778
00:32:22.033 --> 00:32:24.967
so now we...
we read side by side.

779
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.200
That is unbearably sweet.

780
00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:31.367
Yeah. but we blow through books
at a crazy rate.

781
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.834
Thank goodness
for library cards. huh?

782
00:32:34.767 --> 00:32:36.166
Yeah. if only
you'd used the library

783
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:37.500
instead of reading my notebook

784
00:32:37.633 --> 00:32:40.500
when it was very clearly marked
"Not for Travis."

785
00:32:40.633 --> 00:32:42.333
You wanna know the crazy thing?

786
00:32:42.467 --> 00:32:45.000
Your fan fiction was so good
that I ended up

787
00:32:45.133 --> 00:32:47.200
checking out the original books
at the library.

788
00:32:47.333 --> 00:32:50.867
You are actually the reason
I got my first library card.

789
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.367
Oh. um...

790
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.000
You know. Sarah.

791
00:32:56.133 --> 00:32:58.200
I just wanted to say that...

792
00:32:58.333 --> 00:33:00.800
Come on. Dad!

793
00:33:00.934 --> 00:33:02.934
These books aren't
gonna read themselves!

794
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.900
Who is this kid?

795
00:33:06.033 --> 00:33:08.633
Don't ask me.
She's all you.

796
00:33:08.767 --> 00:33:09.800
Yeah. I know.

797
00:33:09.934 --> 00:33:11.800
Okay.

798
00:33:11.934 --> 00:33:13.200
I'll see you tomorrow?

799
00:33:14.367 --> 00:33:16.133
Yeah. Yeah.

800
00:33:16.266 --> 00:33:18.266
'Cause I live...
I'm staying here...

801
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.200
- Right.
- And you're. uh...

802
00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:22.166
- Okay.
- Okay.

803
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.266
Hear ye. hear ye!

804
00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.834
Welcome
to the Christmas Scavenger Hunt!

805
00:33:35.967 --> 00:33:37.834
Hurry up
and grab a piece of paper.

806
00:33:37.967 --> 00:33:39.000
if you don't already have one.

807
00:33:40.967 --> 00:33:42.166
Now. you know the rules.

808
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.133
Follow the clues.

809
00:33:44.266 --> 00:33:46.567
take a picture of each answer.

810
00:33:47.867 --> 00:33:48.767
Where's Sarah?

811
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.834
Well. she could be anywhere.

812
00:33:49.967 --> 00:33:50.734
That's part of the fun.

813
00:33:50.867 --> 00:33:52.667
Okay. look at the first clue.

814
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.033
"The teller of stories..."

815
00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:56.633
- That's her.
- Mm-hmm.

816
00:33:56.767 --> 00:33:59.633
"...in the place
filled with stories."

817
00:34:04.633 --> 00:34:06.533
She's totally there.

818
00:34:06.667 --> 00:34:07.967
Totally.

819
00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.200
The first team back

820
00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:11.166
with a complete set
of photographs...

821
00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:14.367
...wins a pound
of assorted fudge

822
00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.467
from the Candy Corner.

823
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.834
I want that fudge!

824
00:34:18.967 --> 00:34:20.333
That fudge is ours.

825
00:34:22.834 --> 00:34:24.166
On your marks...

826
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.500
We got this.

827
00:34:25.633 --> 00:34:26.367
Get set!

828
00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:30.166
Go!

829
00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:42.166
Okay. okay. I'm coming.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

830
00:34:48.667 --> 00:34:50.633
Hey.

831
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.333
Knew I'd find you here.

832
00:34:53.467 --> 00:34:54.734
Where's Jazzy?

833
00:34:54.867 --> 00:34:57.100
She's looking for you.
tearing the place up.

834
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.834
It's just as good
as I remember.

835
00:35:00.967 --> 00:35:02.367
Ah! Looking for
a little inspiration?

836
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.400
Always.

837
00:35:03.533 --> 00:35:05.433
But I do have a few ideas.
which is exciting.

838
00:35:05.567 --> 00:35:07.033
That is exciting.

839
00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:08.367
I mean. it makes sense.

840
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.567
When you were in New Britain
last time.

841
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.900
you got inspired
for the book.

842
00:35:11.033 --> 00:35:14.100
so now that you're back in town.
maybe it'll inspire you again.

843
00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:17.000
Gotcha!

844
00:35:17.133 --> 00:35:18.900
Take our picture. Dad. Please?

845
00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:20.033
Okay. good job.

846
00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:21.734
Well. get the whole team.

847
00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:23.700
All right.

848
00:35:23.834 --> 00:35:25.200
Say "cheese"!

849
00:35:25.333 --> 00:35:27.066
Cheese!

850
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.433
Did you let them follow us?

851
00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:39.033
Have I taught you nothing about
competitive scavenger-hunting?

852
00:35:39.166 --> 00:35:40.233
I'm sorry.

853
00:35:40.367 --> 00:35:42.266
I tried to throw them
off our trail.

854
00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.300
All right. well.
you're grounded.

855
00:35:44.433 --> 00:35:46.066
Okay. what's the next clue?

856
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.033
"A red wreath where you
might find a spotted dog."

857
00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.600
Fire station!

858
00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:55.600
Shh. shh. Fire station.
Go. go. go. go. go!

859
00:35:55.734 --> 00:35:57.700
- Good luck.
- Bye!

860
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.333
Come on. Dad!

861
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.567
Nice mini-van.

862
00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:08.000
Hey. now!

863
00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:10.500
Moon Boat is a great ride.

864
00:36:10.633 --> 00:36:11.834
"Moon Boat"?

865
00:36:11.967 --> 00:36:12.767
Yeah.

866
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.300
'Cause she's the color
of the moon.

867
00:36:14.433 --> 00:36:17.266
about as big as a cruise liner.
so "Moon... Boat."

868
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.300
Get it?

869
00:36:18.433 --> 00:36:19.500
Mm. Mm-hmm.

870
00:36:19.633 --> 00:36:21.700
Hey. are you coming
to the community center later?

871
00:36:21.834 --> 00:36:23.834
Father Christmas
is gonna be there.

872
00:36:23.967 --> 00:36:26.533
Then I'll definitely be there.

873
00:36:26.667 --> 00:36:28.266
Plus. I have to see
how Jazzy's book tree's going.

874
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.600
Oh. yeah.

875
00:36:29.734 --> 00:36:32.600
She is convinced that. out of
all the ornaments on that tree.

876
00:36:32.734 --> 00:36:33.800
you are going to pick hers.

877
00:36:33.934 --> 00:36:35.533
Well. I will do my best.

878
00:36:35.667 --> 00:36:37.133
Good. Here's a pro tip.

879
00:36:37.266 --> 00:36:39.200
Hers has a big glittery "J"
on it.

880
00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.333
That should do it. Thanks.

881
00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:44.133
Hey. Sarah-Bear!

882
00:36:44.266 --> 00:36:45.066
Oh...

883
00:36:45.934 --> 00:36:48.367
I'm still onto you.
Travis Walker.

884
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.266
One thing they don't tell you
about owning a house

885
00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.800
is that you will be constantly
cleaning the kitchen.

886
00:36:59.934 --> 00:37:02.734
I mean. even if no one's home.
you'll be cleaning the kitchen.

887
00:37:02.867 --> 00:37:05.166
Well. I've heard that.
in some parts of the world.

888
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.834
people can leave a dirty spoon
in the sink

889
00:37:06.967 --> 00:37:08.266
for up to 30 minutes.

890
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.600
and the Earth just continues
to spin on its axis.

891
00:37:10.734 --> 00:37:12.500
Oh!
That is absolutely not true.

892
00:37:12.633 --> 00:37:15.433
I mean. civilization
as we know it would end.

893
00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:17.533
Uh... are these your cookbooks?

894
00:37:18.867 --> 00:37:20.266
Oh. yeah. Uh. yeah.

895
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.600
Take whichever ones you want.

896
00:37:21.734 --> 00:37:24.200
Well. why are you decluttering?

897
00:37:24.333 --> 00:37:27.000
I just...
I have too much stuff.

898
00:37:28.367 --> 00:37:30.867
So. are you rekindling things
with Travis?

899
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.734
There's no rekindling.

900
00:37:32.867 --> 00:37:34.834
Something has to be kindled
in the first place

901
00:37:34.967 --> 00:37:37.266
before it could be rekindled.

902
00:37:38.633 --> 00:37:39.567
Hmm.

903
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.567
Hey. Sarah!

904
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.700
Please thank your agent for me.

905
00:37:45.834 --> 00:37:49.000
Five monster boxes of books
arrived today.

906
00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:50.033
Oh. good.

907
00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:52.000
I'm glad a lot of them are Isabella.

908
00:37:52.133 --> 00:37:53.266
Now that everyone knows

909
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.367
that Sarah Grace
is our hometown hero.

910
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.700
they're even more popular!

911
00:37:57.834 --> 00:38:00.333
Do you want to come by later
and sign some of them?

912
00:38:00.467 --> 00:38:01.467
- I can do that.
- Oh. that's--

913
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.567
Miss Raylene?

914
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.700
Hmm?

915
00:38:03.834 --> 00:38:06.000
What's the story with the mayor
and Miss Patsy?

916
00:38:06.133 --> 00:38:08.100
Those two.

917
00:38:08.233 --> 00:38:11.200
They were
high-school sweethearts.

918
00:38:11.333 --> 00:38:13.000
and then Patsy left.

919
00:38:13.133 --> 00:38:15.467
went off to college.
started her career.

920
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.100
The mayor lost his wife
a few years back.

921
00:38:18.233 --> 00:38:20.600
so he came home
to New Britain.

922
00:38:20.734 --> 00:38:22.934
There's serious chemistry there.

923
00:38:23.066 --> 00:38:24.433
That's the problem.

924
00:38:24.567 --> 00:38:26.734
They're such great friends.

925
00:38:26.867 --> 00:38:28.633
I think both of them
are worried

926
00:38:28.767 --> 00:38:30.900
about torpedoing
their friendship.

927
00:38:31.033 --> 00:38:31.800
Mm.

928
00:38:31.934 --> 00:38:34.467
I tell you what...

929
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.100
I wish there was some way
you Collins women

930
00:38:38.233 --> 00:38:41.367
could make those kismet cookies
again this year.

931
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.967
Then maybe we would find out
once and for all.

932
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.333
- Mm-hmm.
- Ah. Excuse me.

933
00:38:47.467 --> 00:38:48.967
Jazzy!

934
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.000
Oh. Your tree is a hit.

935
00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:53.100
I want to give someone
a book for Christmas.

936
00:38:53.233 --> 00:38:54.233
Can I pick one?

937
00:38:54.367 --> 00:38:55.467
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

938
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.900
I think...

939
00:38:58.033 --> 00:38:59.900
I...

940
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.000
want...

941
00:39:02.133 --> 00:39:03.700
this one!

942
00:39:03.834 --> 00:39:05.200
That's mine.

943
00:39:05.333 --> 00:39:06.900
Is it. seriously?

944
00:39:07.033 --> 00:39:08.133
Let's see what book
you asked for

945
00:39:08.266 --> 00:39:09.567
for Christmas.

946
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:11.433
Isabella's new book?

947
00:39:12.867 --> 00:39:14.867
I know you can do it.

948
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.800
You're the best writer
in the world.

949
00:39:22.667 --> 00:39:24.700
"...and it was
always said of him

950
00:39:24.834 --> 00:39:27.500
that he knew how
to keep Christmas well.

951
00:39:27.633 --> 00:39:29.500
if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

952
00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:31.834
May that be truly said of us..."

953
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.633
"...and all of us.

954
00:39:34.767 --> 00:39:38.000
And so.
as Tiny Tim observed..."

955
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.967
Everyone?

956
00:39:42.967 --> 00:39:46.467
"God bless us... every one!"

957
00:39:48.266 --> 00:39:51.333
Merry Christmas! Ho. ho. ho.

958
00:39:53.133 --> 00:39:54.467
Excellent work.

959
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.400
Thank you. thank you.
thank you.

960
00:39:55.533 --> 00:39:57.300
Oh!
- Great work. Daddy!

961
00:39:57.433 --> 00:39:59.333
Thank you. Jazzy.

962
00:39:59.467 --> 00:40:01.633
And that concludes my duties

963
00:40:01.767 --> 00:40:03.700
as Dickens Day
Father Christmas.

964
00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:06.233
I will be very happy
to let somebody else

965
00:40:06.367 --> 00:40:08.500
wear this itchy thing
next year.

966
00:40:08.633 --> 00:40:10.433
But you've become
so civic-minded.

967
00:40:10.567 --> 00:40:12.567
Parenthood. man.

968
00:40:13.667 --> 00:40:15.700
All right.
I'm gonna go get changed.

969
00:40:15.834 --> 00:40:17.066
I'll catch you later?

970
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.166
Hope so.

971
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.166
'Kay.

972
00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.233
My name's Helen.
You probably don't remember me.

973
00:40:24.367 --> 00:40:26.200
No. I remember you.

974
00:40:26.333 --> 00:40:27.533
You came by for a cookie.

975
00:40:27.667 --> 00:40:28.900
Yeah!

976
00:40:29.033 --> 00:40:32.300
You know. I was skeptical
about the kismet.

977
00:40:32.433 --> 00:40:34.066
Sleep with a cookie
under my pillow?

978
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.166
That's just goofy!

979
00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:36.667
But I did it.

980
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.667
And I dreamed
of my husband that night...

981
00:40:41.767 --> 00:40:43.567
...so when I met him
the next year.

982
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.900
I knew he was the one.

983
00:40:45.867 --> 00:40:47.533
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

984
00:40:47.667 --> 00:40:48.633
And you have a little one?

985
00:40:48.767 --> 00:40:49.867
Two children!

986
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.734
Christopher's
in the candy shop with my mom.

987
00:40:51.867 --> 00:40:53.400
And that's July.

988
00:40:55.166 --> 00:40:56.333
Congratulations.

989
00:40:56.467 --> 00:40:57.700
Thank you.

990
00:40:57.834 --> 00:41:01.767
I cannot believe
that crazy cookie worked.

991
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.100
but it did.

992
00:41:03.233 --> 00:41:04.400
It was magic.

993
00:41:05.433 --> 00:41:07.934
I just wish your grandmother
hadn't stopped making them.

994
00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:09.800
We need all the kismet
we can get.

995
00:41:12.233 --> 00:41:13.500
Thank you.

996
00:41:32.767 --> 00:41:33.633
Come on in.

997
00:41:33.767 --> 00:41:35.400
Oh. what are you doing?

998
00:41:35.533 --> 00:41:37.867
Oh. these are some...
not even all...

999
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.033
of the books that Jazzy
brought home for her project.

1000
00:41:41.166 --> 00:41:42.567
She was bravely
trying to wrap them.

1001
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.767
she got about three in.

1002
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.567
and then fell fast asleep
on the table.

1003
00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:46.734
I just put her down. actually.

1004
00:41:46.867 --> 00:41:48.100
Oh. okay. well.
give me some paper.

1005
00:41:48.233 --> 00:41:48.967
I can help.

1006
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.133
- Okay. Great. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1007
00:41:51.266 --> 00:41:52.633
We don't have
the Isabella books yet

1008
00:41:52.767 --> 00:41:53.800
because Miss Raylene said

1009
00:41:53.934 --> 00:41:55.600
you were going over tomorrow
to sign them.

1010
00:41:55.734 --> 00:41:58.166
Yes. I am. I am.
but I need to talk to you.

1011
00:41:59.367 --> 00:42:01.033
What am I supposed
to do about this?

1012
00:42:01.166 --> 00:42:03.300
Jazzy wants to gift
the new Isabella book.

1013
00:42:03.433 --> 00:42:05.533
and I don't know.
wrapping up a little "I.O.U."

1014
00:42:05.667 --> 00:42:06.900
feels like
a major Scrooge move.

1015
00:42:07.033 --> 00:42:09.066
Okay. well...

1016
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.734
this may be a radical idea.
but hear me out on this.

1017
00:42:11.867 --> 00:42:13.000
Okay.

1018
00:42:13.133 --> 00:42:16.567
Jazzy doesn't always have
to get exactly what she wants.

1019
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.834
I know. I know.

1020
00:42:17.967 --> 00:42:19.333
Crazy idea.

1021
00:42:19.467 --> 00:42:20.900
But I don't want
to disappoint her.

1022
00:42:21.033 --> 00:42:22.934
Honestly. she was probably
just trying to encourage you.

1023
00:42:23.066 --> 00:42:24.400
not put pressure on you.

1024
00:42:24.533 --> 00:42:25.400
It just feels like pressure

1025
00:42:25.533 --> 00:42:26.734
because there's already
so much on you.

1026
00:42:26.867 --> 00:42:29.633
No. here's the thing. Travis.

1027
00:42:29.767 --> 00:42:31.700
I don't feel inspired
much anymore.

1028
00:42:31.834 --> 00:42:33.934
and if I'm not a writer...

1029
00:42:34.066 --> 00:42:35.700
I don't know who I am.

1030
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.000
I can't believe
I just confessed that to you.

1031
00:42:42.133 --> 00:42:43.867
Well...

1032
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.066
I'm your oldest friend.

1033
00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.233
If you can't tell me.
who can you tell?

1034
00:42:52.266 --> 00:42:54.800
Bet you probably never
thought of it that way. huh?

1035
00:42:54.934 --> 00:42:57.166
No. I didn't.

1036
00:43:00.166 --> 00:43:02.233
Uh...

1037
00:43:02.367 --> 00:43:04.300
so. listen.

1038
00:43:05.934 --> 00:43:07.900
I've got this pound of fudge

1039
00:43:08.033 --> 00:43:09.667
that we won
from the scavenger hunt...

1040
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.800
Wait. You won?

1041
00:43:10.934 --> 00:43:12.967
Yeah. of course we won.
What. did you doubt us?

1042
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.867
No. of course not.

1043
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.233
You want to break into it?

1044
00:43:16.367 --> 00:43:17.367
I'm good. actually.

1045
00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.567
- Oh. really? Okay...
- No. I'm good...

1046
00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.734
yeah. good at breaking into it. yeah.

1047
00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.567
It never ends.

1048
00:43:30.934 --> 00:43:32.500
Sarah?

1049
00:43:32.633 --> 00:43:34.734
I. um. I'm gonna go to town
to run some errands.

1050
00:43:34.867 --> 00:43:36.000
Do you need anything?

1051
00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:37.000
No. I'm good. Thanks.

1052
00:43:37.133 --> 00:43:38.166
Okay.

1053
00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.500
Gramma Mia?

1054
00:43:39.633 --> 00:43:41.200
Do you remember Helen?

1055
00:43:41.333 --> 00:43:44.000
She was the woman
who came by for a cookie

1056
00:43:44.133 --> 00:43:46.200
the last time we made them?

1057
00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:47.867
Oh.

1058
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.467
Um...

1059
00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.066
Was she the one
that was really skeptical?

1060
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.700
She was.

1061
00:43:53.834 --> 00:43:55.400
Yeah.

1062
00:43:55.533 --> 00:43:59.200
I-I saw her at
the Dickens Festival yesterday.

1063
00:43:59.333 --> 00:44:00.133
Oh.

1064
00:44:00.266 --> 00:44:02.467
With her husband.

1065
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.734
The man she dreamt of
that night.

1066
00:44:04.867 --> 00:44:06.767
Hmm.

1067
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.800
So. um...

1068
00:44:11.066 --> 00:44:12.567
...what do you think
that means?

1069
00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:16.800
I mean. if her kismet worked
for sure...

1070
00:44:16.934 --> 00:44:19.400
Then maybe the cookies worked?

1071
00:44:19.533 --> 00:44:22.300
And I wish
that I had never...

1072
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.600
I feel like...

1073
00:44:26.734 --> 00:44:29.633
when I ripped up that recipe. I...

1074
00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:32.433
broke a connection
to this town

1075
00:44:32.567 --> 00:44:35.200
and our house.
and even to you.

1076
00:44:35.333 --> 00:44:37.066
Oh. ho. ho. my Sarah.

1077
00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.400
Are you kidding?

1078
00:44:38.533 --> 00:44:39.967
Oh. darling.

1079
00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.033
You could never
break a connection to me.

1080
00:44:43.166 --> 00:44:46.233
I love you
for ever and ever.

1081
00:44:47.266 --> 00:44:49.166
And ever.

1082
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:53.867
But still...

1083
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.600
don't mess up my kitchen
while I'm gone.

1084
00:45:08.767 --> 00:45:09.667
Benny.

1085
00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.333
Nice picture.

1086
00:45:11.467 --> 00:45:14.233
Jasmine is adorable.

1087
00:45:14.367 --> 00:45:17.133
But listen.
We gotta talk shop.

1088
00:45:17.266 --> 00:45:19.633
I had a meeting with Hal today.
and he said

1089
00:45:19.767 --> 00:45:22.533
if you don't
meet the deadline this time...

1090
00:45:23.667 --> 00:45:25.433
...I'm sorry. but he's gonna
bring in a ghostwriter

1091
00:45:25.567 --> 00:45:27.467
to finish the book.

1092
00:45:53.467 --> 00:45:55.100
It's our brainstorming spot.

1093
00:45:55.233 --> 00:45:57.900
I know.
I thought I'd find you here.

1094
00:45:58.934 --> 00:46:01.567
All these years.
and this view hasn't changed.

1095
00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.800
Also. why are you
wearing that uniform?

1096
00:46:03.934 --> 00:46:05.900
'Cause I work
for the forestry service.

1097
00:46:06.033 --> 00:46:07.567
for six years now.

1098
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.567
- Oh.
- It's my day job.

1099
00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.700
It's how I make a living

1100
00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:12.166
in between
all the volunteering gigs

1101
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.633
that Jazzy signs me up for.

1102
00:46:13.767 --> 00:46:14.834
- Huh.
- Man. Gramma Mia

1103
00:46:14.967 --> 00:46:16.767
really didn't tell you
anything about me. did she?

1104
00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.000
No.

1105
00:46:18.133 --> 00:46:20.500
And I think Gramma Mia's
keeping more secrets.

1106
00:46:20.633 --> 00:46:21.567
Is that why you're here?

1107
00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.734
No.

1108
00:46:22.867 --> 00:46:24.233
I heard from Benny.

1109
00:46:24.367 --> 00:46:25.900
It's not good.

1110
00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:28.000
They might hire a ghostwriter.

1111
00:46:28.133 --> 00:46:29.233
Really?

1112
00:46:29.367 --> 00:46:31.100
Ooh. That is not good.

1113
00:46:31.233 --> 00:46:32.767
How close to being done
are you?

1114
00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:35.100
I'm pretty close.
I'd say 80%.

1115
00:46:35.233 --> 00:46:37.934
but the ending
does not make sense.

1116
00:46:38.066 --> 00:46:39.533
and I can't just find it.

1117
00:46:39.667 --> 00:46:42.266
So. let me get this straight.

1118
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.567
You decided
to tackle this issue

1119
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.767
by walking down here
and not writing?

1120
00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:48.867
Well. escape has always been

1121
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.734
my favorite form
of self-preservation...

1122
00:46:50.867 --> 00:46:52.000
as you well know.

1123
00:46:52.133 --> 00:46:54.500
Oh. I remember.

1124
00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.600
You know...

1125
00:46:59.734 --> 00:47:02.433
way back then.

1126
00:47:02.567 --> 00:47:05.266
if you had asked me to predict
what your life would become.

1127
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.133
I could've nailed it.

1128
00:47:07.266 --> 00:47:08.500
Successful writer.

1129
00:47:08.633 --> 00:47:09.900
traveling around.

1130
00:47:10.033 --> 00:47:12.066
beloved.

1131
00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.000
But my life?

1132
00:47:14.133 --> 00:47:18.900
This is not
what I would've predicted.

1133
00:47:19.033 --> 00:47:21.567
But I'm good... you know?

1134
00:47:23.133 --> 00:47:24.967
Christmas always makes me sentimental.

1135
00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:26.934
I'm sorry.

1136
00:47:27.066 --> 00:47:29.934
How long
did your marriage last?

1137
00:47:30.066 --> 00:47:31.934
Not very long.

1138
00:47:32.066 --> 00:47:32.967
Where is she now?

1139
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.233
Crystal is traveling around
with her band.

1140
00:47:35.367 --> 00:47:38.633
Living the life she loves...

1141
00:47:38.767 --> 00:47:40.300
so am I.

1142
00:47:40.433 --> 00:47:42.066
But she checks in a lot.

1143
00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.934
Jazzy knows
her mom loves her.

1144
00:47:45.066 --> 00:47:46.633
There're no bad guys here. Sarah.

1145
00:47:46.767 --> 00:47:47.900
There's just a lot of people

1146
00:47:48.033 --> 00:47:50.400
who care about
one amazing little girl.

1147
00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.266
You turned out to be
a good dad. Travis Walker.

1148
00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.166
Thanks.

1149
00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.500
But sometimes
I think I try too hard.

1150
00:48:00.633 --> 00:48:03.633
I mean. I don't have to be
"Father of the Year" every year.

1151
00:48:03.767 --> 00:48:07.333
Right. Well. you have been
known to be competitive.

1152
00:48:07.467 --> 00:48:09.000
Me?

1153
00:48:09.133 --> 00:48:10.900
Only since birth.

1154
00:48:11.934 --> 00:48:13.667
Okay. so here's the deal.

1155
00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.533
Jazzy's been invited
to a sleepover.

1156
00:48:15.667 --> 00:48:17.400
It's her first one.
and I don't think she should go.

1157
00:48:17.533 --> 00:48:21.066
'cause she's too young.
but she desperately wants to go.

1158
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.867
You didn't do sleepovers
at that age?

1159
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.333
Yeah. of course I did.

1160
00:48:24.467 --> 00:48:26.967
but this is
completely different...

1161
00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:28.433
except for I know it's not.

1162
00:48:32.867 --> 00:48:34.000
All right.

1163
00:48:34.133 --> 00:48:36.500
They don't pay me to sit around
enjoying the view

1164
00:48:36.633 --> 00:48:38.400
with a beautiful woman.

1165
00:48:38.533 --> 00:48:40.667
I'm outta here.

1166
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.967
Hey. Thanks for the lollipop.

1167
00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:43.934
Oh. yeah. You bet.

1168
00:48:44.066 --> 00:48:46.567
Oh. and if you're around later.

1169
00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.867
you could come with
as I surrender my innocent child

1170
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.834
into the hands
of complete strangers?

1171
00:48:50.967 --> 00:48:52.834
I'll be your rock.

1172
00:48:53.834 --> 00:48:55.300
Thank you.

1173
00:48:59.266 --> 00:49:02.333
Are you kidding me?
Snowball?

1174
00:49:03.233 --> 00:49:06.300
Man. some people never grow up.
I guess.

1175
00:49:07.367 --> 00:49:08.533
Yeah...

1176
00:49:08.667 --> 00:49:10.633
that's me.

1177
00:49:17.567 --> 00:49:18.433
Okay. Jazzy.

1178
00:49:18.567 --> 00:49:20.166
This is a big moment
in your life...

1179
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.500
Okay. bye!

1180
00:49:21.633 --> 00:49:23.800
Okay. Well. have fun.

1181
00:49:23.934 --> 00:49:25.500
But don't be afraid to call me
if you feel sc...

1182
00:49:25.633 --> 00:49:27.767
- I will. Promise!
- I love you!

1183
00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.133
Okay!

1184
00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:31.400
Hey! I am so excited.

1185
00:49:31.533 --> 00:49:34.834
This is gonna be
the best sleepover ever.

1186
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.667
They're nice people. right?

1187
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.767
Right?

1188
00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.000
Oh... I ran a background check
on the family.

1189
00:49:42.133 --> 00:49:43.767
- No. you didn't.
- I did.

1190
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.400
I did.
and then I ran their prints.

1191
00:49:45.533 --> 00:49:46.533
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1192
00:49:46.667 --> 00:49:48.133
The entire family's
squeaky clean.

1193
00:49:48.266 --> 00:49:49.433
Really?
No parking tickets?

1194
00:49:49.567 --> 00:49:50.600
None.

1195
00:49:50.734 --> 00:49:52.767
Then I called up old friends
where they used to live.

1196
00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:54.433
and I got
personal recommendations

1197
00:49:54.567 --> 00:49:55.467
for all of them.

1198
00:49:57.033 --> 00:49:58.767
Thank you.

1199
00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:00.266
She's not gonna last all night.

1200
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.000
I'm gonna call me around 10:00.

1201
00:50:02.133 --> 00:50:03.266
- Travis?
- Yes?

1202
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.567
Start Moon Boat
and get out of here.

1203
00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:07.900
You can't stay parked here.
It's very creepy.

1204
00:50:08.033 --> 00:50:09.333
You're right. Okay.

1205
00:50:09.467 --> 00:50:10.767
I gotta pick up that tree anyways.

1206
00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:11.767
Wait.

1207
00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:13.233
- What?
- You didn't get a tree yet?

1208
00:50:13.367 --> 00:50:15.266
N... my Father Christmas responsibilities

1209
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.300
were greater than expected.

1210
00:50:16.433 --> 00:50:17.400
so I didn't have time.

1211
00:50:17.533 --> 00:50:18.633
I'm gonna go get it now.
but first.

1212
00:50:18.767 --> 00:50:20.700
I'm gonna drop you off at home.
so you can write.

1213
00:50:20.834 --> 00:50:21.967
Okay. Fair enough.

1214
00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.000
Wait. Hold on.

1215
00:50:23.133 --> 00:50:24.266
What?

1216
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.000
I need you to drop me
at the Bookmark instead.

1217
00:50:26.133 --> 00:50:28.367
I need to sign those books.
- Oh. fine.

1218
00:50:29.233 --> 00:50:30.934
I don't know what I'm gonna do!

1219
00:50:31.066 --> 00:50:34.800
I'm here! I'm here.
What's going on?

1220
00:50:34.934 --> 00:50:35.967
Slight situation.

1221
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.200
The mayor invited Patsy
to Christmas dinner.

1222
00:50:39.333 --> 00:50:40.767
Oh. sweet!

1223
00:50:41.967 --> 00:50:44.266
I mean... not good.
Very bad.

1224
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.567
Well. Albert and I
have been best of friends

1225
00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:48.900
for years now.

1226
00:50:49.033 --> 00:50:51.500
Okay. well. maybe
he's inviting you to join him

1227
00:50:51.633 --> 00:50:52.633
as a friend.

1228
00:50:52.767 --> 00:50:54.500
because you're alone
and he has a whole turkey.

1229
00:50:54.633 --> 00:50:56.233
Do you know Ethel Kaye?

1230
00:50:56.367 --> 00:50:57.433
Owns the jewelry shop?

1231
00:50:57.567 --> 00:50:58.533
No.

1232
00:50:58.667 --> 00:51:00.166
Well. she's good people.

1233
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:02.400
And she told Mary Alice.
who told Carol.

1234
00:51:02.533 --> 00:51:04.000
who told me

1235
00:51:04.133 --> 00:51:07.400
that our mayor was shopping
for an expensive necklace.

1236
00:51:07.533 --> 00:51:09.133
Oh...

1237
00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:11.500
And... that's a bad thing?

1238
00:51:11.633 --> 00:51:14.767
Well. a necklace
is gateway jewelry.

1239
00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.667
I'm sorry... what?

1240
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.700
It's gateway jewelry!

1241
00:51:19.834 --> 00:51:21.133
He gives her the necklace.

1242
00:51:21.266 --> 00:51:24.667
If she likes it.
he tries a... bracelet...

1243
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.567
- Mm.
- ...or maybe he ups the ante

1244
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.500
and goes straight
for the diamond ring.

1245
00:51:28.633 --> 00:51:29.467
Oh!

1246
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.400
You could be engaged
by New Year's!

1247
00:51:31.533 --> 00:51:33.000
Oh! Raylene...

1248
00:51:33.133 --> 00:51:35.400
I just...

1249
00:51:36.433 --> 00:51:39.500
I need to know
if-if Albert is-is "The One."

1250
00:51:39.633 --> 00:51:41.400
or if I'm just
some crazy old lady

1251
00:51:41.533 --> 00:51:44.233
with delusions of
finding true love again.

1252
00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:45.567
Patsy and I were hoping

1253
00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.533
Mia could
bake kismet cookies again...

1254
00:51:48.667 --> 00:51:49.900
just one batch...

1255
00:51:50.033 --> 00:51:51.834
so she could be sure

1256
00:51:51.967 --> 00:51:54.033
before she heads over there
for Christmas dinner.

1257
00:51:54.166 --> 00:51:57.033
Unfortunately.
I just can't do it from memory.

1258
00:51:57.166 --> 00:51:59.333
I mean. that was
a very complicated recipe.

1259
00:51:59.467 --> 00:52:01.600
I'm sorry
I ripped up the recipe

1260
00:52:01.734 --> 00:52:02.867
when I was a teenager.

1261
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:03.834
Oh. no. that's okay.

1262
00:52:03.967 --> 00:52:04.900
That's okay. sugar.

1263
00:52:05.033 --> 00:52:07.000
We know your feelings
were bruised.

1264
00:52:07.133 --> 00:52:10.100
but kismet cookies
are a part of Mia.

1265
00:52:10.233 --> 00:52:13.066
a part of your house.
a part of this town.

1266
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:16.800
and like it or not.
a part of you.

1267
00:52:16.934 --> 00:52:18.667
I know!

1268
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.633
But they're also not real.
We all know that. Right?

1269
00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.533
Mia? What do you think?

1270
00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.500
I think...

1271
00:52:30.567 --> 00:52:33.266
...our house gave Nana Sue
that recipe a hundred years ago

1272
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.734
for a reason.

1273
00:52:34.867 --> 00:52:36.633
And I think

1274
00:52:36.767 --> 00:52:38.600
if we're supposed to have
that recipe again this year.

1275
00:52:38.734 --> 00:52:39.734
then...

1276
00:52:39.867 --> 00:52:41.133
we will.

1277
00:52:41.266 --> 00:52:42.367
But...

1278
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.867
But right now. you have
a big box of books to sign.

1279
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:46.867
so come on. you get started.

1280
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.967
and the rest of us
will wrap as you go.

1281
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.066
- We will.
- Okay. Uh...

1282
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.066
Right here.

1283
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.266
"What should we do. Isabella?"

1284
00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.734
everyone asked.

1285
00:52:58.867 --> 00:53:01.333
Isabella said...

1286
00:53:03.166 --> 00:53:05.166
...I don't know.

1287
00:53:10.166 --> 00:53:11.667
- Hey.
- Hi.

1288
00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.333
Christmas crisis.

1289
00:53:13.467 --> 00:53:14.433
Oh. what's wrong?

1290
00:53:14.567 --> 00:53:16.800
Uh. Jazzy wants a sweater
for Christmas.

1291
00:53:16.934 --> 00:53:18.200
Okay.

1292
00:53:18.333 --> 00:53:20.266
But I'm pretty sure
the window of time

1293
00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:21.433
in which. I. as her father.

1294
00:53:21.567 --> 00:53:23.166
can successfully
select her clothing.

1295
00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.266
or anything else.
is rapidly closing.

1296
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.934
Soon. I will know nothing...

1297
00:53:27.066 --> 00:53:28.633
about sweaters
or anything else.

1298
00:53:28.767 --> 00:53:30.367
Yeah. that's probably accurate.

1299
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.333
- Yeah. So...
- Okay.

1300
00:53:32.467 --> 00:53:35.233
Option... one.

1301
00:53:38.033 --> 00:53:38.934
No?
- Meh.

1302
00:53:39.066 --> 00:53:41.600
Okay. Okay. Okay. That's fair.

1303
00:53:41.734 --> 00:53:43.633
Number... two?

1304
00:53:43.767 --> 00:53:45.066
Mm...

1305
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.667
nice sweater.
- Yeah?

1306
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.800
Atrocious color.

1307
00:53:47.934 --> 00:53:49.200
You could put
a golden retriever puppy

1308
00:53:49.333 --> 00:53:50.200
in this sweater...

1309
00:53:50.333 --> 00:53:51.633
and it wouldn't look cute.

1310
00:53:51.767 --> 00:53:52.800
Okay.

1311
00:53:52.934 --> 00:53:54.467
Well...

1312
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:57.867
we're down to... number three?

1313
00:53:59.734 --> 00:54:02.333
And the third one
was just right.

1314
00:54:02.467 --> 00:54:04.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1315
00:54:04.133 --> 00:54:06.400
Great. Okay. Thank you.

1316
00:54:06.533 --> 00:54:07.500
Sure.

1317
00:54:07.633 --> 00:54:09.667
All right. I'm gonna
return these other two

1318
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.633
before the store closes.
Thank you.

1319
00:54:11.767 --> 00:54:13.934
Okay.

1320
00:54:14.066 --> 00:54:14.934
Uh. you know what?

1321
00:54:15.066 --> 00:54:18.066
I... I'm not getting
any work done here.

1322
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.233
so I could... come with you?

1323
00:54:21.367 --> 00:54:23.433
- Okay.
- Okay.

1324
00:54:23.567 --> 00:54:25.900
I mean. returns are. like.

1325
00:54:26.033 --> 00:54:27.600
they could be
really challenging.

1326
00:54:27.734 --> 00:54:28.533
Okay.

1327
00:54:33.233 --> 00:54:34.500
Thanks again for this.

1328
00:54:34.633 --> 00:54:35.333
Of course.

1329
00:54:35.467 --> 00:54:36.867
And you're sure
about the scarf?

1330
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.500
Absolutely.
100%. She'll love it.

1331
00:54:38.633 --> 00:54:40.367
But keep the receipt
just in case.

1332
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:41.667
Oh. did she text you?

1333
00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:42.834
Not yet.

1334
00:54:42.967 --> 00:54:45.033
Well. she's not going to.
She's having fun!

1335
00:54:46.667 --> 00:54:48.767
Oh!
Christmas trivia.

1336
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.100
Oh... that gift certificate

1337
00:54:50.233 --> 00:54:52.000
would make
an excellent stocking stuffer

1338
00:54:52.133 --> 00:54:54.200
for a certain bookworm
I know.

1339
00:54:54.333 --> 00:54:56.000
Okay. well...

1340
00:54:56.133 --> 00:54:57.667
should we go win it for her?

1341
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.934
Next category is...

1342
00:55:04.066 --> 00:55:06.166
Christmas movies!

1343
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.567
- Ooh!
- Number one...

1344
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.667
Christmas isn't Christmas

1345
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:12.867
until Hans Gruber falls
from Nakatomi Plaza.

1346
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.333
Name the movie.

1347
00:55:15.467 --> 00:55:16.567
Die Hard.

1348
00:55:18.467 --> 00:55:19.834
So. did you get your tree yet?

1349
00:55:19.967 --> 00:55:23.600
Mm-mm.
I got caught in sweater limbo.

1350
00:55:23.734 --> 00:55:25.567
It's so weird
that you don't have a tree.

1351
00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.000
Are you judging
Father Christmas?

1352
00:55:28.133 --> 00:55:31.500
No. I'm judging a guy who works
in the forestry service.

1353
00:55:31.633 --> 00:55:32.734
I don't know. I feel like

1354
00:55:32.867 --> 00:55:35.667
maybe you saw a nice tree or two
in the past few weeks.

1355
00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:37.900
I feel like
you're taking a tone here.

1356
00:55:38.033 --> 00:55:39.600
I'm not taking a tone!

1357
00:55:39.734 --> 00:55:41.300
I think
you're taking a tone.

1358
00:55:41.433 --> 00:55:42.633
Question two...

1359
00:55:42.767 --> 00:55:46.233
a young boy tries to obtain
an article of clothing

1360
00:55:46.367 --> 00:55:47.734
for his sick mother.

1361
00:55:47.867 --> 00:55:50.066
Name the movie.

1362
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.400
Oh. um...

1363
00:55:51.533 --> 00:55:52.767
The Christmas Shoes.

1364
00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.000
Wait-wait-wait.
Are you sure?

1365
00:55:54.133 --> 00:55:55.066
Isn't it the one
where there's. like...

1366
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.633
Are you...

1367
00:55:56.767 --> 00:55:59.066
questioning my Christmas movie
expertise here?

1368
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.500
Mm. You're right. You're right.
I'm sorry.

1369
00:56:00.633 --> 00:56:01.633
- Thank you.
- Never.

1370
00:56:01.767 --> 00:56:02.500
Thank you.

1371
00:56:02.633 --> 00:56:05.367
Ah! Here she is.
Text from Jazzy.

1372
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.633
You ready to go pick her up?

1373
00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.033
"Can I go skating with them
tomorrow?"

1374
00:56:14.333 --> 00:56:16.367
Are you laughing at me?

1375
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.900
I'm just saying. you know.

1376
00:56:19.033 --> 00:56:21.867
at the risk of
stating the obvious...

1377
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.900
you've raised a happy.
well-adjusted kid

1378
00:56:24.033 --> 00:56:26.066
who's starting
her second decade of life.

1379
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.000
in which her main purpose
is separating from you.

1380
00:56:29.934 --> 00:56:31.600
Was that intended
to make me feel better?

1381
00:56:31.734 --> 00:56:33.633
'Cause...

1382
00:56:33.767 --> 00:56:34.900
Look. I'm just saying...

1383
00:56:35.033 --> 00:56:36.700
with all the expertise
that comes from. you know.

1384
00:56:36.834 --> 00:56:39.367
never actually
having my own kid...

1385
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:42.834
maybe you could just...
relax a little?

1386
00:56:42.967 --> 00:56:44.900
I don't know. you're a good dad.

1387
00:56:45.033 --> 00:56:48.200
and the criteria for that
changes over time.

1388
00:56:48.333 --> 00:56:51.233
and maybe
this is one of those times?

1389
00:56:51.367 --> 00:56:53.500
Okay! Here we go.

1390
00:56:53.633 --> 00:56:56.400
In this modern-day Dickens tale.

1391
00:56:56.533 --> 00:56:59.233
Bill Murray plays
the star character.

1392
00:56:59.367 --> 00:57:00.600
Scrooged.

1393
00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:07.200
It's definitely Scrooged.

1394
00:57:12.667 --> 00:57:15.800
whd

1395
00:57:15.934 --> 00:57:18.200
...something...

1396
00:57:19.934 --> 00:57:22.600
...something cool.

1397
00:57:32.266 --> 00:57:33.233
What's up?

1398
00:57:33.367 --> 00:57:35.266
Oh. good.
you're awake and dressed.

1399
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.900
It's nine in the morning.

1400
00:57:37.033 --> 00:57:39.200
Yeah. but I know how
you creative types are.

1401
00:57:39.333 --> 00:57:41.133
Up all night.
living on coffee and chocolate.

1402
00:57:41.266 --> 00:57:43.433
Oh! Well. I know
how small towns are.

1403
00:57:43.567 --> 00:57:44.700
You better be dressed by nine.

1404
00:57:44.834 --> 00:57:45.900
with the front room
picked up.

1405
00:57:46.033 --> 00:57:47.033
- Hmm!
- Hmm.

1406
00:57:47.166 --> 00:57:49.567
Okay. You're gonna need
your coat and your boots.

1407
00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:50.700
- Wait. what?
- Let's go.

1408
00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:51.700
Where are we going?

1409
00:57:51.834 --> 00:57:52.934
Well. it's Christmas Eve tomorrow.

1410
00:57:53.066 --> 00:57:53.967
Yeah?

1411
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.200
Well. remember that whole

1412
00:57:55.333 --> 00:57:56.800
"Travis doesn't have
a Christmas tree yet" fiasco?

1413
00:57:56.934 --> 00:57:58.000
Let's go cut one down.

1414
00:57:58.133 --> 00:57:58.934
Now?

1415
00:57:59.066 --> 00:58:01.533
What. are you working?

1416
00:58:01.667 --> 00:58:02.967
- Sort of!
- Uh-huh.

1417
00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.200
That's what I thought.
- Yeah.

1418
00:58:04.333 --> 00:58:05.633
Come on.
You can help me pick one out.

1419
00:58:05.767 --> 00:58:07.266
We'll put your boots on
on the porch.

1420
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.300
This is very abrupt.

1421
00:58:10.367 --> 00:58:12.967
We left town
at least half an hour ago.

1422
00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:14.934
We're passing lots of trees!

1423
00:58:15.066 --> 00:58:17.533
Lots of trees.
I'm just saying.

1424
00:58:17.667 --> 00:58:19.834
Look.
there's a science to this.

1425
00:58:24.467 --> 00:58:27.300
So. how does this choppy-down
tree thingy work?

1426
00:58:27.433 --> 00:58:29.033
Do we just pick one?

1427
00:58:29.166 --> 00:58:30.467
"Choppy-down tree thingy"?

1428
00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.800
Writers have a way with words.

1429
00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:34.500
Well...

1430
00:58:34.633 --> 00:58:36.133
first...

1431
00:58:36.266 --> 00:58:38.000
you're gonna need gloves.

1432
00:58:38.133 --> 00:58:39.166
Look at that.

1433
00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.834
You actually keep gloves
in your glove compartment.

1434
00:58:41.967 --> 00:58:43.300
Yeah. You don't?

1435
00:58:43.433 --> 00:58:45.867
I live in New York.
I don't even have a car.

1436
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:46.800
Right.

1437
00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:51.800
Oh... wow.

1438
00:58:51.934 --> 00:58:54.333
Travis. this is gorgeous.

1439
00:58:54.467 --> 00:58:55.867
Yeah. it's nice. huh?

1440
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.967
Oh. Yeah.
and everything's so quiet.

1441
00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.367
Well. if it makes you feel
more at home.

1442
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:02.367
I could honk the horn.

1443
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:03.900
yell at you
to get out of the way...

1444
00:59:04.033 --> 00:59:06.667
Hey! I'm walkin' here!

1445
00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:07.667
That do anything for you?

1446
00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:08.834
I'm good. thanks.

1447
00:59:08.967 --> 00:59:09.834
Okay.

1448
00:59:09.967 --> 00:59:10.967
Are you sure
whoever owns this cabin

1449
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:12.400
is cool with us cutting down
one of their trees?

1450
00:59:12.533 --> 00:59:14.700
'Cause I've seen scary movies
that start this way.

1451
00:59:14.834 --> 00:59:17.533
Oh. yeah. We go way back.

1452
00:59:17.667 --> 00:59:19.200
He doesn't mind.

1453
00:59:20.166 --> 00:59:23.033
Come on.
Let's go cut down a tree.

1454
00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.900
Okay.

1455
00:59:26.033 --> 00:59:28.900
And. uh. what's
the bear population like here?

1456
00:59:29.033 --> 00:59:29.900
Asking for a friend.

1457
00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:32.900
Uh... there's a few.

1458
00:59:33.033 --> 00:59:35.533
Oh. Do you always
cut down your own tree?

1459
00:59:35.667 --> 00:59:37.700
No. but I started
so late this year.

1460
00:59:37.834 --> 00:59:39.533
I figure
I better finish strong. so...

1461
00:59:39.667 --> 00:59:41.900
Ooh! Oh. That one. Over there.

1462
00:59:42.033 --> 00:59:43.367
Whoa.

1463
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.166
You okay?

1464
00:59:50.367 --> 00:59:53.200
Yeah. I'm fine.

1465
00:59:53.333 --> 00:59:55.000
Okay.

1466
00:59:55.133 --> 00:59:58.233
So. uh. which tree
did you risk your life for?

1467
00:59:58.367 --> 01:00:00.433
That one.

1468
01:00:00.567 --> 01:00:01.433
You sure?

1469
01:00:01.567 --> 01:00:03.567
A hundred percent.

1470
01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.100
All right.

1471
01:00:05.233 --> 01:00:06.934
Have at 'er.

1472
01:00:07.066 --> 01:00:08.100
Oh!

1473
01:00:08.233 --> 01:00:09.834
You wanted...

1474
01:00:09.967 --> 01:00:10.900
I just...

1475
01:00:11.033 --> 01:00:13.767
I don't know if I mentioned. but...

1476
01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.934
in New York. I kind of. like.
do writing-based activities--

1477
01:00:17.066 --> 01:00:20.200
All right. all right.
All right. I see.

1478
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
You sure?

1479
01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:26.100
It's perfect!

1480
01:00:28.033 --> 01:00:30.100
It really is a great tree.

1481
01:00:30.233 --> 01:00:32.500
When my writing career dries up.
I could be a lumberjack.

1482
01:00:32.633 --> 01:00:34.700
Or is it "lumberjill"?

1483
01:00:34.834 --> 01:00:37.033
Can I show you somethin'?

1484
01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:39.767
Sure.

1485
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:42.433
The reason I know
the owner doesn't mind

1486
01:00:42.567 --> 01:00:43.867
us chopping down a tree

1487
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.533
is because my great-uncle Steve
used to own this place.

1488
01:00:46.667 --> 01:00:47.767
Oh.

1489
01:00:51.066 --> 01:00:54.367
So. my uncle Steve passed
two years ago.

1490
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.600
Two years?

1491
01:00:55.734 --> 01:00:57.567
He must've had
a great housekeeper.

1492
01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:01.133
Uh. well...
here. can I take your jacket?

1493
01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:03.567
Okay. Yeah.

1494
01:01:05.433 --> 01:01:07.600
Here. Thank you.

1495
01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.233
Travis?

1496
01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:13.367
Yeah?

1497
01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.467
What's going on?

1498
01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.934
Well. um...

1499
01:01:18.233 --> 01:01:19.734
I inherited the place.

1500
01:01:19.867 --> 01:01:21.433
This is yours?

1501
01:01:21.567 --> 01:01:23.133
It is.

1502
01:01:23.266 --> 01:01:25.967
But I don't remember you having
a family cabin as a kid.

1503
01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.600
Well. my uncle Steve
wasn't the friendliest guy.

1504
01:01:29.734 --> 01:01:31.500
but he worked in forestry.

1505
01:01:31.633 --> 01:01:33.333
so when I joined up.
we became closer.

1506
01:01:33.467 --> 01:01:35.667
and he left the place to me.

1507
01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.900
Jazzy must love it here.

1508
01:01:38.033 --> 01:01:40.133
Yeah. She does.

1509
01:01:40.266 --> 01:01:42.867
Oh. that reminds me.
Can I see your phone?

1510
01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:47.100
Thank you.

1511
01:01:47.233 --> 01:01:48.600
May I have that back?

1512
01:01:48.734 --> 01:01:50.300
No. you may not.

1513
01:01:50.433 --> 01:01:51.500
Travis?

1514
01:01:51.633 --> 01:01:53.367
What are we doing here?
I need to get back and write.

1515
01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.600
Okay. look.
Look. look. look.

1516
01:01:54.734 --> 01:01:58.133
Last night. I was thinking
about your writer's block.

1517
01:01:58.266 --> 01:01:59.266
and I was driving myself crazy

1518
01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.533
trying to think
of a way to help you.

1519
01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:04.300
and this is
what I came up with.

1520
01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.567
I don't understand.

1521
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.867
Look. obviously. I can't
finish your book for you.

1522
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.700
but I can...

1523
01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:15.200
clear the road.

1524
01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:16.633
I can feed you.

1525
01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:20.033
and I can be here
to bounce ideas off of.

1526
01:02:20.166 --> 01:02:22.567
just like we used to.

1527
01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.500
I just figured this was...

1528
01:02:24.633 --> 01:02:27.100
a lot warmer
than our brainstorming bench.

1529
01:02:28.667 --> 01:02:30.166
But...

1530
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.400
What?

1531
01:02:31.533 --> 01:02:32.867
But what about Jazzy?

1532
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.967
Jazzy? She's ten!

1533
01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.400
She can fend for herself.

1534
01:02:37.433 --> 01:02:39.767
Gramma Mia's gonna pick her up
after her sleepover.

1535
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.200
they're gonna do
some last-minute shopping.

1536
01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:43.066
and they're gonna help out
at the Candy Corner.

1537
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.667
This whole thing
is a group effort. Sarah.

1538
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.033
But... I don't have my laptop.

1539
01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:50.667
Well. you didn't have a laptop
when you wrote before.

1540
01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.100
I bet you didn't even have it
when you wrote Isabella.

1541
01:02:54.133 --> 01:02:56.600
Well. you're right.
I didn't.

1542
01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.500
We're going old-school here. Sarah.

1543
01:02:59.633 --> 01:03:01.633
And... I picked this up.

1544
01:03:01.767 --> 01:03:02.900
So we're stocked.

1545
01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:07.467
What are you doing?

1546
01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.133
Oh. um...

1547
01:03:10.266 --> 01:03:14.066
I'm making
a garland for the tree.

1548
01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.867
It's kind of a family tradition.

1549
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.200
You're making a garland?

1550
01:03:17.333 --> 01:03:19.367
Yes. Sarah.
I have a daughter now.

1551
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.166
and I... I do crafts.

1552
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:22.767
This... this is me.

1553
01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.233
But quit stalling!

1554
01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:26.233
Tell me what you got so far.

1555
01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.300
Come on.
- Okay. okay!

1556
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.600
Well...

1557
01:03:31.734 --> 01:03:35.867
I left off when Roger
was having some issues. um...

1558
01:03:39.867 --> 01:03:42.767
Roger helping Isabella
find her kismet was genius.

1559
01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.033
Thank you.

1560
01:03:53.033 --> 01:03:54.066
What?

1561
01:03:56.734 --> 01:03:57.967
What?

1562
01:03:59.033 --> 01:04:02.033
No. Are you kidding?

1563
01:04:04.533 --> 01:04:06.133
All right!

1564
01:04:06.266 --> 01:04:08.500
Yes! Yes!

1565
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.333
Yes.

1566
01:04:11.467 --> 01:04:13.300
You did it. Congratulations.

1567
01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:15.333
No. We did it.

1568
01:04:15.467 --> 01:04:17.100
Thank you.

1569
01:04:17.233 --> 01:04:18.533
I'm gonna type this up
when I get home

1570
01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:20.300
and send it to Benny
in the morning.

1571
01:04:20.433 --> 01:04:22.633
Okay.

1572
01:04:22.767 --> 01:04:23.834
Oh. um...

1573
01:04:25.433 --> 01:04:27.500
...it's my daughter
texting from Gramma Mia's phone.

1574
01:04:27.633 --> 01:04:29.967
asking me politely
where her Christmas tree is.

1575
01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:30.867
We should to go.

1576
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.700
Yeah. okay. I'll get the fire.

1577
01:04:32.834 --> 01:04:35.100
- I'll clean this up.
- Okay.

1578
01:04:51.567 --> 01:04:53.867
It's Christmas Eve. you know?
I have a life.

1579
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.200
No. you don't.

1580
01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:57.266
Besides. I have
a Christmas present for you.

1581
01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.300
You can open it early.

1582
01:04:58.433 --> 01:05:00.333
What is it?

1583
01:05:01.367 --> 01:05:03.066
Check your email.

1584
01:05:09.567 --> 01:05:12.767
Oh. if you were here right now.
I would hug you!

1585
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.700
Can you read it right away?

1586
01:05:14.834 --> 01:05:16.500
Because I think it's good.
but I'm a writer.

1587
01:05:16.633 --> 01:05:18.266
so I'm also needy
and thin-skinned.

1588
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.233
Yes. you are.
and yes. I can.

1589
01:05:21.367 --> 01:05:22.533
Okay. bye.

1590
01:05:22.667 --> 01:05:23.867
Wait. wait. wait!

1591
01:05:25.066 --> 01:05:28.033
Wait.
Did Travis help with this?

1592
01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.000
He took me to a charming cabin
in the woods.

1593
01:05:32.133 --> 01:05:33.200
confiscated my phone.

1594
01:05:33.333 --> 01:05:35.667
and fed me fudge and coffee
'til I was done?

1595
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.033
That man is
a walking. talking chef's kiss.

1596
01:05:39.166 --> 01:05:41.600
So maybe that cookie
was right after all.

1597
01:05:41.734 --> 01:05:43.567
Read the book. Benny.

1598
01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:46.266
Reading! Right now.

1599
01:06:23.367 --> 01:06:26.300
You should see our Sarah.

1600
01:06:26.433 --> 01:06:28.934
You'd be so proud of her.

1601
01:06:31.867 --> 01:06:34.800
And she's here for Christmas.

1602
01:06:36.633 --> 01:06:39.266
Oh. I miss you every day.

1603
01:06:49.767 --> 01:06:52.066
Oh...

1604
01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.633
good morning. darling.

1605
01:06:53.767 --> 01:06:54.734
Morning. Gramma.

1606
01:06:59.467 --> 01:07:02.567
I get a little sentimental
on Christmas Eve.

1607
01:07:03.667 --> 01:07:06.066
Um. listen.
I have some errands to run.

1608
01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.500
but I won't be gone long.
-'Kay.

1609
01:07:08.633 --> 01:07:10.500
Okay.

1610
01:07:10.633 --> 01:07:12.200
Oh. Raylene called.

1611
01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:13.400
Patsy's in a tizzy.

1612
01:07:13.533 --> 01:07:15.734
She doesn't know what to bring
to the mayor's house.

1613
01:07:15.867 --> 01:07:17.133
so. uh. duty calls.

1614
01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:18.633
Okay. see you later.

1615
01:07:18.767 --> 01:07:19.734
See you.

1616
01:07:31.533 --> 01:07:33.000
Okay.

1617
01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:35.800
You amazing. amazing house...

1618
01:07:35.934 --> 01:07:37.133
I'm in a pickle here.

1619
01:07:37.266 --> 01:07:38.700
It's Christmas Eve.

1620
01:07:38.834 --> 01:07:39.967
and I want to give my grandma

1621
01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.834
the one thing
that she really wants.

1622
01:07:41.967 --> 01:07:44.800
which to dream
of Grandpop again.

1623
01:07:44.934 --> 01:07:46.667
And Patsy needs help too.

1624
01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.867
And this might be
our last chance.

1625
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.066
because I think my grandmother
is leaving us both.

1626
01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.700
And. if I'm being honest.

1627
01:07:58.834 --> 01:08:01.367
I want to see
if I dream of Travis again.

1628
01:08:26.166 --> 01:08:28.500
Okay! Okay.

1629
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.433
Can I see
if Sarah wants to help us

1630
01:08:37.567 --> 01:08:39.033
put the angel
on top of the tree?

1631
01:08:39.166 --> 01:08:41.333
Yeah. Seems only fair.
since she picked out the tree.

1632
01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.734
Sarah?

1633
01:08:48.867 --> 01:08:50.266
In the kitchen!

1634
01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.900
Sarah. do you want to help us
with the angel on the...

1635
01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.166
You made... kismet cookies?

1636
01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.934
I did.

1637
01:09:01.066 --> 01:09:03.700
Are those
the true-love kinds?

1638
01:09:03.834 --> 01:09:05.467
Yes. They are.

1639
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.667
I'm going to deliver one
to a friend.

1640
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.166
I'll catch up
with you later. okay?

1641
01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.433
Half a pound
of peppermint crunch.

1642
01:09:27.567 --> 01:09:29.266
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.

1643
01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.600
Sarah!

1644
01:09:30.734 --> 01:09:32.934
You look like someone
who could use some more fudge.

1645
01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:36.967
Merry Christmas.

1646
01:09:38.433 --> 01:09:39.633
Oh. my...

1647
01:09:39.767 --> 01:09:42.500
It looks exactly
the way I remember it!

1648
01:09:42.633 --> 01:09:44.600
Oh. honey!

1649
01:09:44.734 --> 01:09:46.500
But how did you...?

1650
01:09:46.633 --> 01:09:48.533
Well. Gramma Mia was right.

1651
01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:50.767
We are meant
to have that recipe.

1652
01:09:52.266 --> 01:09:54.200
Oh.

1653
01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:55.500
Oh!

1654
01:09:55.633 --> 01:09:57.867
Sweet dreams. Miss Patsy.

1655
01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.800
Oh!
Thank you. honey.

1656
01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:06.133
I might have a service issue
in the square or something.

1657
01:10:06.266 --> 01:10:07.467
If you squeeze that phone
any tighter.

1658
01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.700
it's gonna turn to dust.

1659
01:10:08.834 --> 01:10:11.700
Well... I just don't know
what's taking Benny so long.

1660
01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:13.533
I feel like
he really must hate it.

1661
01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:15.867
Oh. yeah. that's the only
possible explanation.

1662
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.600
Unless. of course.

1663
01:10:17.734 --> 01:10:18.767
he's already here.

1664
01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.367
and you just happen
to randomly bump into him.

1665
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.934
Benny!

1666
01:10:23.066 --> 01:10:24.633
What are you doing here?

1667
01:10:24.767 --> 01:10:28.133
I have to meet family tomorrow.
so I added a stop...

1668
01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:30.200
because we need to talk.

1669
01:10:31.266 --> 01:10:32.700
I read the manuscript.

1670
01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:34.133
Okay.

1671
01:10:34.266 --> 01:10:36.100
And it's...

1672
01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:40.333
...spectacular.

1673
01:10:40.467 --> 01:10:42.100
I'm sorry.
That was so mean.

1674
01:10:42.233 --> 01:10:44.333
It is every bit as good
as the first.

1675
01:10:44.467 --> 01:10:46.367
Dare I say... better?

1676
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.166
Oh!

1677
01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.867
Oh. oh. So sorry.

1678
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Travis. Benny.

1679
01:10:52.133 --> 01:10:53.433
Benny. Travis.

1680
01:10:53.567 --> 01:10:54.834
Hi. Nice to finally meet you.

1681
01:10:54.967 --> 01:10:56.467
You too.

1682
01:10:57.734 --> 01:11:00.900
Benny. I cannot believe
that you're here.

1683
01:11:01.033 --> 01:11:02.033
Do you need to stay with us?

1684
01:11:02.166 --> 01:11:04.100
No. I booked at the B&B.
I have an early flight.

1685
01:11:04.233 --> 01:11:07.333
I just wanted to see your face
in real life when I told you.

1686
01:11:07.467 --> 01:11:09.834
And I wanted to see...

1687
01:11:09.967 --> 01:11:11.934
this town.

1688
01:11:12.066 --> 01:11:13.800
And maybe finally meet
Gramma Mia?

1689
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.033
Oh. okay. well. um...
I think that could be arranged.

1690
01:11:18.166 --> 01:11:20.333
Come. come. come.

1691
01:11:20.467 --> 01:11:21.500
Come on.

1692
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.767
So. wait. did you actually
bake kismet cookies?

1693
01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.867
Yeah. I did.

1694
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.200
But I thought the recipe was...

1695
01:11:32.333 --> 01:11:34.166
Don't even.
I can't explain it.

1696
01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.934
Well... did you
save me one?

1697
01:11:37.066 --> 01:11:38.900
Seriously? You want to try it?

1698
01:11:39.033 --> 01:11:42.433
Jaded literary agents
need love too. you know.

1699
01:11:50.667 --> 01:11:51.834
Um...

1700
01:11:51.967 --> 01:11:54.233
you know. I'm gonna
go back to the B&B

1701
01:11:54.367 --> 01:11:55.533
and make some calls.

1702
01:11:55.667 --> 01:11:56.600
I'll text you later.

1703
01:11:56.734 --> 01:11:57.934
- Okay.
- Okay.

1704
01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.600
Gramma Mia?

1705
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.967
Hey. darling.

1706
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.734
- Hey.
- Hi.

1707
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.533
I found the recipe.

1708
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.266
I know.

1709
01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.500
Hey! Where are the cookies?

1710
01:12:24.633 --> 01:12:26.633
Oh. they're gone.

1711
01:12:26.767 --> 01:12:28.900
I mean. you told Patsy.
so Patsy told Raylene.

1712
01:12:29.033 --> 01:12:31.266
and Raylene told... everyone...

1713
01:12:32.533 --> 01:12:33.467
Yes. it was...

1714
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.166
it was like old times again
for a few minutes.

1715
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.967
I mean. there was...
there was a line out the door.

1716
01:12:39.133 --> 01:12:40.767
I forgot how much I missed it.

1717
01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.500
Well. we can do it
next year. right?

1718
01:12:42.633 --> 01:12:43.633
We can bake all day.

1719
01:12:46.967 --> 01:12:48.900
You're selling the house.
aren't you?

1720
01:12:49.033 --> 01:12:50.333
That's why
you're sorting everything.

1721
01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:52.333
Yeah. I am.

1722
01:12:52.467 --> 01:12:53.934
Are you okay?

1723
01:12:54.066 --> 01:12:56.400
Please be okay.
I really need you to be okay.

1724
01:12:56.533 --> 01:12:58.600
Oh. my gosh. I am so okay!

1725
01:12:58.734 --> 01:13:00.233
I... oh. I'm fine. darling.

1726
01:13:00.367 --> 01:13:02.300
I-I-I'm fit as ever.
I just...

1727
01:13:04.133 --> 01:13:05.900
I just miss teaching.

1728
01:13:06.033 --> 01:13:08.233
I miss...
I miss helping children.

1729
01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.066
So I've signed up for. um.

1730
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.300
for a program for seniors
teaching English abroad.

1731
01:13:17.367 --> 01:13:19.333
I just didn't know
how to tell you.

1732
01:13:19.467 --> 01:13:21.400
Okay.

1733
01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.633
What about the house?

1734
01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:28.367
Oh. it's...
it's just too much for me now.

1735
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.166
But the kismet needs
a Collins woman here.

1736
01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.700
- Well...
- I think.

1737
01:13:32.834 --> 01:13:34.600
I suppose you're right. but...

1738
01:13:35.767 --> 01:13:38.567
...maybe this really is the end.

1739
01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:40.000
I guess...

1740
01:13:40.133 --> 01:13:44.500
Patsy will have
our last kismet cookie.

1741
01:13:44.633 --> 01:13:46.600
Except...

1742
01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.567
I saved one for you...

1743
01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.233
in case you wanted it.

1744
01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:00.233
No. You keep it.

1745
01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:02.100
I made it for you.

1746
01:14:02.233 --> 01:14:04.266
'cause I want you
to dream of Grandpop again.

1747
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.867
Oh...

1748
01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.400
...are you sure?

1749
01:14:10.433 --> 01:14:11.900
I'm sure.

1750
01:14:13.233 --> 01:14:15.100
Thank you. darling.

1751
01:14:15.233 --> 01:14:17.200
I love you.

1752
01:14:19.567 --> 01:14:22.800
Did you know that she
was planning to sell the house?

1753
01:14:22.934 --> 01:14:24.200
Well. I suspected.

1754
01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:27.033
but I didn't know
she was gonna go teach.

1755
01:14:27.166 --> 01:14:28.367
That's kind of excellent.

1756
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.867
Well. I know. but...

1757
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.300
What?

1758
01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:34.400
What?

1759
01:14:34.533 --> 01:14:36.033
What about the kismet?

1760
01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:42.400
When I was little. I knew...
I just knew...

1761
01:14:42.533 --> 01:14:43.533
that it was all real...

1762
01:14:43.667 --> 01:14:47.200
like. the cookies.
and that we were special.

1763
01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:49.467
But when I...

1764
01:14:51.066 --> 01:14:52.567
You had the dream about me.

1765
01:14:53.934 --> 01:14:55.734
Yeah. it all...

1766
01:14:55.867 --> 01:14:57.033
pretty much crashed down.

1767
01:14:57.166 --> 01:14:58.100
Mm-hmm.

1768
01:14:58.233 --> 01:15:00.367
And I started thinking

1769
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.133
that it was just some fluff
that my family told.

1770
01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:07.066
and the whole town
went along with it.

1771
01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.567
But... now?

1772
01:15:11.834 --> 01:15:13.800
Now.
I don't know what to think.

1773
01:15:13.934 --> 01:15:17.133
I mean. this town...

1774
01:15:17.266 --> 01:15:19.934
and the cookies.
and. I don't know.

1775
01:15:20.066 --> 01:15:22.266
all the people. like...

1776
01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.467
...it feels like home again.

1777
01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.333
Mm.

1778
01:15:28.467 --> 01:15:30.000
Travis. I don't even
want to tell you

1779
01:15:30.133 --> 01:15:33.800
how long I spent struggling
to write the second book.

1780
01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:34.800
Like. struggling.

1781
01:15:34.934 --> 01:15:38.000
But I come here and... wow!

1782
01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:39.200
suddenly...

1783
01:15:39.333 --> 01:15:41.133
there are ideas in here
that I've written down

1784
01:15:41.266 --> 01:15:43.000
for the next three
Isabella books.

1785
01:15:43.133 --> 01:15:44.133
Three!

1786
01:15:44.266 --> 01:15:46.700
I don't want my grandmother
to sell her house!

1787
01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:49.266
I don't want
some stranger living there.

1788
01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.133
I don't want some stranger
living there either.

1789
01:15:51.266 --> 01:15:52.600
I want you living there.

1790
01:15:52.734 --> 01:15:53.767
Me?

1791
01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:54.767
Yeah.

1792
01:15:55.834 --> 01:15:58.266
I bet Gramma Mia'd give you
a great deal on the place.

1793
01:15:59.734 --> 01:16:00.667
Oh. well...

1794
01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.533
I'm leaving soon. so...

1795
01:16:02.667 --> 01:16:03.400
My life's in New York.

1796
01:16:03.533 --> 01:16:05.367
But. Sarah...

1797
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.200
...what if...

1798
01:16:09.333 --> 01:16:11.033
that cookie was right

1799
01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:13.500
all those years ago?

1800
01:16:13.633 --> 01:16:16.066
If I promise not to marry anyone
tomorrow morning.

1801
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.500
would you stick around. and...

1802
01:16:19.633 --> 01:16:20.633
and maybe we could find out?

1803
01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:29.734
I-I... I cannot do this
right now.

1804
01:16:29.867 --> 01:16:31.967
I don't. um...

1805
01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.333
good night. Travis.

1806
01:16:33.467 --> 01:16:34.433
- Sarah? Sarah!
- No. Good night.

1807
01:16:34.567 --> 01:16:36.700
Hey!

1808
01:16:36.834 --> 01:16:38.433
Sarah. wait!

1809
01:16:38.567 --> 01:16:40.066
Sarah!

1810
01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:49.567
So we're back
to believing that kismet's real?

1811
01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.066
Probably?

1812
01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.367
I don't know.

1813
01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.734
Maybe? Uh...

1814
01:16:53.867 --> 01:16:57.166
But all the cookies are gone.
so you can't prove your theory?

1815
01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:58.266
Right.

1816
01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.767
Is it too late
to bake another batch?

1817
01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.967
Well...

1818
01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.867
15 a.m.

1819
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.667
Merry Christmas.

1820
01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.300
Well. seems like
you have two choices.

1821
01:17:11.433 --> 01:17:14.400
One. you come back to New York
and make your agent very happy.

1822
01:17:14.533 --> 01:17:15.633
you stay single.

1823
01:17:15.767 --> 01:17:17.500
and maybe get
writer's block again.

1824
01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:20.233
and some stranger moves
into Gramma Mia's house.

1825
01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.300
Or two...

1826
01:17:23.433 --> 01:17:24.800
you move here.

1827
01:17:24.934 --> 01:17:27.800
to this cute town
that inspires you.

1828
01:17:27.934 --> 01:17:31.834
in a house that you seem
to share DNA with.

1829
01:17:31.967 --> 01:17:33.467
and the handsome guy

1830
01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.767
you've loved
since you were a kid.

1831
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.333
who clearly
feels something too.

1832
01:17:39.867 --> 01:17:43.266
It's a cripplingly difficult
decision. I know.

1833
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.500
But. Benny...

1834
01:17:44.633 --> 01:17:46.600
But. Sarah.

1835
01:17:47.734 --> 01:17:49.967
What if none of it's real?

1836
01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.667
Oh. but what if it all is?

1837
01:18:15.300 --> 01:18:18.467
Ooh! Merry Christmas.
darling Sarah!

1838
01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.834
Merry Christmas!

1839
01:18:19.967 --> 01:18:20.867
Gramma Mia...

1840
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.066
I have two questions for you.

1841
01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.433
Okay.

1842
01:18:23.567 --> 01:18:25.033
Did you dream of Grandpop?

1843
01:18:26.533 --> 01:18:27.667
All night.

1844
01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.000
Oh...

1845
01:18:29.133 --> 01:18:31.834
- Then the recipe worked.
- Yeah.

1846
01:18:33.133 --> 01:18:35.500
Okay. second question. then.

1847
01:18:35.633 --> 01:18:37.934
How many cookies
did you give away last night?

1848
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:39.900
All of them.

1849
01:18:40.033 --> 01:18:41.367
But how many?

1850
01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.867
Um... seven or eight.

1851
01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.500
Why?

1852
01:18:45.633 --> 01:18:47.567
Well. I made 12.

1853
01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:50.100
So one for you.
one for Patsy...

1854
01:18:51.367 --> 01:18:53.734
But that means that there were
ten of them on the counter.

1855
01:18:53.867 --> 01:18:56.133
Oh. no. there were
definitely not that many.

1856
01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.934
Why?

1857
01:19:00.133 --> 01:19:04.300
Well. I just found one
under my pillow...

1858
01:19:05.533 --> 01:19:06.467
Oh!

1859
01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.000
And if there were two of them
missing. then...

1860
01:19:10.133 --> 01:19:12.567
that means...

1861
01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:15.166
Jazzy!

1862
01:19:37.767 --> 01:19:39.300
Did you dream about Travis?

1863
01:19:41.667 --> 01:19:42.633
Sarah!

1864
01:19:42.767 --> 01:19:44.767
It worked!

1865
01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:46.600
Oh. that's fantastic!

1866
01:19:46.734 --> 01:19:47.800
Oh!

1867
01:19:47.934 --> 01:19:50.133
Mia. have you come clean
with your granddaughter yet?

1868
01:19:50.266 --> 01:19:51.734
Oh. she has.

1869
01:19:51.867 --> 01:19:53.233
Wait! You have. right?

1870
01:19:53.367 --> 01:19:54.467
There's not more. is there?

1871
01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:55.567
Because I can never tell
with you.

1872
01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:56.934
No. that's everything!

1873
01:19:57.066 --> 01:19:58.800
I just wanted to come by
and thank you.

1874
01:19:58.934 --> 01:19:59.900
I'm so relieved.

1875
01:20:00.033 --> 01:20:02.500
And happy!
And excited!

1876
01:20:03.834 --> 01:20:04.734
Oh. I want
to see that necklace!

1877
01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:06.934
Oh. I'll come by later.
I promise!

1878
01:20:07.066 --> 01:20:08.734
Merry Christmas!

1879
01:20:10.133 --> 01:20:12.066
Okay. so...

1880
01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.300
before we open presents.
let's go next door

1881
01:20:14.433 --> 01:20:16.734
and give Gramma Mia her gifts.
all right?

1882
01:20:16.867 --> 01:20:18.233
And then when we're over there.

1883
01:20:18.367 --> 01:20:19.734
I'd like you
to apologize to Sarah

1884
01:20:19.867 --> 01:20:21.834
for putting that cookie
under her pillow.

1885
01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:25.433
Hey. Jazzy.

1886
01:20:25.567 --> 01:20:27.700
You don't
have to give me sad-face.

1887
01:20:27.834 --> 01:20:30.333
I just want you
to take responsibility. okay?

1888
01:20:31.367 --> 01:20:33.367
Okay.

1889
01:20:37.767 --> 01:20:39.533
Merry Christmas.
Anybody home?

1890
01:20:39.667 --> 01:20:41.934
Yes! In the kitchen.

1891
01:20:42.066 --> 01:20:43.533
Merry Christmas. Gramma Mia.

1892
01:20:43.667 --> 01:20:44.734
Oh!

1893
01:20:44.867 --> 01:20:47.000
- Where's Sarah?
- Jazzy. Oh. she's not here.

1894
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.734
What's that?

1895
01:20:50.867 --> 01:20:53.300
Oh. that's the second
Isabella book.

1896
01:20:53.433 --> 01:20:55.233
First draft.
hot off the presses.

1897
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.300
She used her real name.

1898
01:21:00.433 --> 01:21:01.300
Yes. she did!

1899
01:21:01.433 --> 01:21:03.166
And she left that for you.

1900
01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:04.467
She left it?

1901
01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.800
Mm. Yeah. before
she went to the airport.

1902
01:21:06.934 --> 01:21:08.533
The airport?

1903
01:21:08.667 --> 01:21:11.967
Daddy. is she leaving
because of something I did?

1904
01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.567
Oh. no. no. no. sweetie. No.

1905
01:21:16.333 --> 01:21:18.100
I think she left because of
something I didn't do.

1906
01:21:18.233 --> 01:21:20.533
Come on!
- Daddy. we have to catch her.

1907
01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:21.967
I know! Let's go!

1908
01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:23.834
Wait! Wait.
you don't underst--

1909
01:21:30.633 --> 01:21:32.300
Sarah. I'm so sorry
about the cookie!

1910
01:21:32.433 --> 01:21:33.433
Please don't leave!

1911
01:21:33.567 --> 01:21:35.967
I'm not mad at you. Jazzy.
It's okay.

1912
01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.500
Gramma Mia said you were
going to the airport.

1913
01:21:37.633 --> 01:21:38.400
so I thought...

1914
01:21:38.533 --> 01:21:41.467
Oh. I... I gave Benny a lift.

1915
01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.333
He had an early flight.

1916
01:21:42.467 --> 01:21:43.800
So you're not leaving?

1917
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.500
No.

1918
01:21:46.633 --> 01:21:48.033
No. I thought
I'd stick around.

1919
01:21:49.467 --> 01:21:50.567
Do some more writing.

1920
01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:52.800
Maybe buy Gramma Mia's house.

1921
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.667
Unless you got married
while I was at the airport?

1922
01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.600
No. ma'am. I did not.

1923
01:21:59.834 --> 01:22:00.900
Jazzy? Come on.

1924
01:22:01.033 --> 01:22:02.500
Why don't you and I
go make some breakfast?

1925
01:22:02.633 --> 01:22:03.867
But I already ate.

1926
01:22:07.333 --> 01:22:09.600
Oh!

1927
01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:15.867
Did she put a cookie
under your pillow. too?

1928
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.433
Oh yeah!

1929
01:22:17.567 --> 01:22:19.900
And did you dream about me?

1930
01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:22.967
It doesn't matter.

1931
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.934
Look. I don't
need a cookie to tell me

1932
01:22:25.066 --> 01:22:26.333
that I'm in love with you.

1933
01:22:26.467 --> 01:22:29.367
It doesn't matter
what I dreamed.

1934
01:22:30.667 --> 01:22:33.333
You totally dreamt about me.
didn't you?

1935
01:22:33.467 --> 01:22:35.233
All night long.

1936
01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:37.333
Did you?

1937
01:22:38.367 --> 01:22:40.333
You want to know
what I remember

1938
01:22:40.467 --> 01:22:43.734
about that infamous
not-really-a-bear attack?

1939
01:22:43.867 --> 01:22:45.600
Um...

1940
01:22:45.734 --> 01:22:48.333
screaming?

1941
01:22:48.467 --> 01:22:50.867
Running.
locking the deadbolt?

1942
01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.133
Before that!

1943
01:22:52.266 --> 01:22:54.400
There was a split second

1944
01:22:54.533 --> 01:22:56.600
where you didn't know
it was a dog either.

1945
01:22:56.734 --> 01:22:59.433
And you stepped in front of me.

1946
01:22:59.567 --> 01:23:00.500
You remember that?

1947
01:23:00.633 --> 01:23:02.100
Yeah.

1948
01:23:02.233 --> 01:23:05.400
You stepped between me
and the bear.

1949
01:23:07.567 --> 01:23:10.600
That was the day I fell in love
with you. Travis Walker...

1950
01:23:12.567 --> 01:23:15.500
...and it's been
every day since.

1951
01:23:15.633 --> 01:23:18.200
Of course I dreamt
about you again.

1952
01:23:18.333 --> 01:23:19.767
It's kismet.

1953
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.967
Merry Christmas. Sarah-Bear.
