3
00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:40.874
What's wrong?

4
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.002
- Where's Jason. have you seen him?

5
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.301
Your mom tells me

6
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:52.927
you keep bugging her about stories.

7
00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:01.394
I can tell you stories.

8
00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:05.398
I can tell
you plenty of stories. Anok.

9
00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:32.592
Jason. Jason. are you home?

10
00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:36.554
I know right now. you would
not believe

11
00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:41.434
First of all. those
cigarettes

12
00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:47.941
Our home we called back

13
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.695
in the Philippines. it
was a beautiful place.

14
00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:57.700
Every sunset was the most
beautiful sunset you've ever seen.

15
00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.160
It was...

16
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.966
I'll take you back there if you want.

17
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.429
I have to save enough money first.

18
00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.182
but I'll take you camping back home.

19
00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.198
Well. Anok. what do you say?

20
00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:53.483
Wake up!

21
00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:35.358
The first thing you
notice when you're there

22
00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.068
are the mornings.

23
00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:40.196
They feel so quiet. even if it's not.

24
00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:47.870
You enjoy that little
bit of peace. that quiet.

25
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.332
because I promise you it never lasts.

26
00:05:50.808 --> 00:05:55.563
The Philippines is a small
country. but it's a big place.

27
00:05:55.563 --> 00:05:57.982
I lived there 33 years.

28
00:05:57.982 --> 00:05:59.025
And you know what?

29
00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:01.194
I still got lost.

30
00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.830
Just always remember. when you're lost

31
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.665
just turn around and go back.

32
00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:47.008
Another thing I can tell
you. Anok. is to be careful.

33
00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:49.719
You can take a lot of
things from the forest.

34
00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:54.724
wood. food. but you have
to always ask permission

35
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.477
from whatever is living there.

36
00:07:57.477 --> 00:08:00.855
And you have to watch your
step because you never know

37
00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:03.191
if you're stepping on someone's home.

38
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:04.025
- Ah!

39
00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:31.260
Small. invisible dwarves
that likes to steal

40
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.513
small little things around the house.

41
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:35.139
Naughty little monsters.

42
00:08:36.557 --> 00:08:37.850
They are mostly harmless.

43
00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:40.811
Mostly.

44
00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:24.230
But the most dangerous
things in the forest

45
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.565
are not the monsters.

46
00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:43.958
No. they're the ones who
look exactly like us.

47
00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:48.170
Men and women. so beautiful people are

48
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.256
lost forever chasing after them.

49
00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:53.926
If we ever see one.
Anok. remember one thing.

50
00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.224
Do not follow them.

51
00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:27.019
- Oh. oh god.

52
00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:30.981
Please. please I wasn't
trying anything. I swear.

53
00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:36.487
Huh?

54
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:43.369
I'm sorry. I can't understand what you're.

55
00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:04.181
No. no. don't!

56
00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:12.648
That's where I'm from. Canada.

57
00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:20.865
Canada.

58
00:12:20.865 --> 00:12:21.699
- Canada.

59
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:23.993
- Canada.

60
00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:29.290
- Canada.

61
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.294
- Close enough.

62
00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:41.594
No. no!

63
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:46.766
I'm sorry. I don't under--

64
00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:48.809
I don't know what you're talking about.

65
00:12:49.643 --> 00:12:51.103
No. I don't. I swear.

66
00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:53.063
Please don't hurt me. please.

67
00:12:53.063 --> 00:12:56.984
Please. please. please.
please. please. please.

68
00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:18.672
Wait. wait. you're hurt.

69
00:13:19.507 --> 00:13:20.716
You can't be walking around with that

70
00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:21.967
sticking out of your leg.

71
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:27.765
What are you doing?

72
00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:00.214
Oh god. oh god.

73
00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:01.715
Hey. hey. hey!

74
00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:02.967
Over here. over here!

75
00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:05.928
Look. we need to get her to a hospital.

76
00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:06.887
I think she's hurt.

77
00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:09.265
Come on. help me.

78
00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:13.352
Hey. where you going?

79
00:14:13.352 --> 00:14:16.313
Hey. at least tell me
where the nearest town is.

80
00:14:17.565 --> 00:14:18.941
Where did I work?

81
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:22.611
Well. there was plenty of work.

82
00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:27.116
I once managed this coconut oil mill.

83
00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:29.159
but it didn't matter what you made.

84
00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:30.661
People wanted to buy it.

85
00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:32.621
Business was good.

86
00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:20.252
- Please tell me you can see her.

87
00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:37.853
I need brown bottle. now.

88
00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:41.899
- Brown bottle. brown
bottle. brown bottle.

89
00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:42.733
Okay.

90
00:15:42.733 --> 00:15:44.360
- Wrong brown bottle.

91
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.200
Brown bottle!

92
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.326
- Here. here.

93
00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:54.036
- That's wrong brown bottle!

94
00:15:54.036 --> 00:15:54.995
- They're all brown.

95
00:15:54.995 --> 00:15:55.829
- Wrong brown bottle!

96
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:57.498
- They're all brown!

97
00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:09.009
- Brown bottle!

98
00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:14.515
Ah. yeah. thank you very much.

99
00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:15.432
Hold. hold.

100
00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:53.012
Oh.

101
00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:31.216
- Yeah. yeah.

102
00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:37.598
- What your name?

103
00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:41.226
- Jason.

104
00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:42.061
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:49.109
Me. you call me Batibat.

106
00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:51.236
Letter B as in victory.

107
00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:00.412
Americano ah?

108
00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:01.413
- Canadian.

109
00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:02.247
Oh!

110
00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:04.124
- Common mistake. that's all right.

111
00:18:04.124 --> 00:18:05.876
- Oh. Canada.

112
00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.419
I don't want to go there. very cold.

113
00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.592
- Why can't people see her?

114
00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:14.593
- Third eye.

115
00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:15.469
- Huh?

116
00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:16.303
- Third eye.

117
00:18:16.303 --> 00:18:18.388
You see things other people don't.

118
00:18:19.598 --> 00:18:20.974
You see her.

119
00:18:20.974 --> 00:18:22.684
Where did you find her?

120
00:18:22.684 --> 00:18:24.269
- Just here and there.

121
00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:26.188
- You know. when I was little girl.

122
00:18:26.188 --> 00:18:28.190
I used to live near volcano.

123
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.735
And then I realized I see
things other people don't.

124
00:18:32.569 --> 00:18:34.988
I'd have to stay awake in the night

125
00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:41.078
smoking in the tree.

126
00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:42.329
Then they're standing around the tall.

127
00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:43.789
running around the house.

128
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:47.167
And then when there's a great boom.

129
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.215
But me?

130
00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:55.759
I would like to wait for
that special someone.

131
00:18:57.511 --> 00:18:59.388
When everything is quiet.

132
00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:03.851
Even the insects. even the birds. gone.

133
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.938
I know she's here.

134
00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:10.274
Magayon is here.

135
00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:14.069
You mean her?

136
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.244
- Her.

137
00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:36.550
- Well what is she?

138
00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.385
- Ha. look at you now!

139
00:19:39.803 --> 00:19:41.972
She used to be a princess.

140
00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:47.352
People come here to meet her.

141
00:19:47.352 --> 00:19:51.106
asking to marry her. but that is one.

142
00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:53.817
And this. there is one. one. one thing.

143
00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:54.651
You know.

144
00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:58.906
Pagtuga. name Pagtuga.

145
00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.449
Is very jealous. see?

146
00:20:01.658 --> 00:20:03.243
Very angry.

147
00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:07.206
And then one day there is
one foreigner come here.

148
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:08.999
His name is Ulap.

149
00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:12.419
He and Magayon meet in the lake.

150
00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:13.921
They fall in love.

151
00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:17.799
And then Pagtuga heard about it.

152
00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:19.092
Pagtuga fight Ulap. Ulap fight Pagtuga!

153
00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:21.595
Fight. fight. fight. fight!

154
00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:22.512
Magayon said. "Stop!"

155
00:20:22.512 --> 00:20:26.350
Nobody sees me because of that. men die.

156
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.227
And then one day. fight. fight. fight.

157
00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:29.102
Fight. fight. fight.

158
00:20:29.102 --> 00:20:30.520
Fight. fight. fight.

159
00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.314
Magayon got hit.

160
00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:33.148
- She died?

161
00:20:33.148 --> 00:20:34.024
- Of course!

162
00:20:34.024 --> 00:20:36.693
Why. you foreigner get stuck by a knife.

163
00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:37.694
you will not die?

164
00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:42.532
Anyway.

165
00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:45.202
You know that the daga. the lupa.

166
00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:47.871
They buried Magayon.

167
00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:53.669
They buried her. everybody
sad. everybody's lonely.

168
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:55.629
Everybody's crying.

169
00:20:55.629 --> 00:21:00.259
But the place. it got bigger. bigger.

170
00:21:02.302 --> 00:21:03.136
It grows.

171
00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:06.807
It grows a very beautiful mountain.

172
00:21:08.517 --> 00:21:10.227
Magayon Volcano.

173
00:21:12.896 --> 00:21:15.315
They say. hello?

174
00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:17.693
Sister lives there.

175
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.574
You should bring her home.

176
00:21:38.338 --> 00:21:39.589
Bring her home!

177
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.870
Jason. Jason.

178
00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:11.390
Here.

179
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.460
What are you waiting for?

180
00:25:48.296 --> 00:25:49.130
- Canada.

181
00:25:50.465 --> 00:25:51.716
Canada's fine. look we have to go.

182
00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:54.219
All right. no touching.
no touching. I gotta...

183
00:25:54.219 --> 00:25:55.220
Look. I'm just trying to help.

184
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.097
I'm not trying to hurt you. okay?

185
00:26:23.123 --> 00:26:24.082
I know one fact

186
00:26:24.082 --> 00:26:25.792
that will always be true.

187
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:31.256
Filipino women are the most
beautiful women in the world.

188
00:26:33.508 --> 00:26:35.135
They're also the hardest to woo.

189
00:26:40.473 --> 00:26:43.852
First thing you must
learn. you cannot be shy.

190
00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:54.904
Just give me a minute.

191
00:26:54.904 --> 00:26:57.324
Second. you must know how to

192
00:26:57.324 --> 00:26:58.700
read her signals.

193
00:27:12.505 --> 00:27:14.966
Third. you will learn fast

194
00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.926
whether she likes you back or not.

195
00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:27.437
- My volcano.

196
00:27:44.621 --> 00:27:45.789
That's me in the middle.

197
00:27:47.374 --> 00:27:49.459
My dad. he was from here.

198
00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.422
I'm guessing that's where
you need to go. right?

199
00:27:54.422 --> 00:27:55.715
Home?

200
00:27:55.715 --> 00:27:56.800
To the very top.

201
00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:00.470
And I'm guessing the guy
back there was what. Pagtuga?

202
00:28:01.763 --> 00:28:03.556
Pagtuga.

203
00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:05.183
- Exactly. Pagtuga.

204
00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:07.977
I'm guessing he's after you?

205
00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:11.564
I'm guessing you wanna get back home?

206
00:28:13.733 --> 00:28:14.567
I wanna help.

207
00:28:17.404 --> 00:28:18.238
- Canada.

208
00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:28.123
- Is that a yes?

209
00:28:42.178 --> 00:28:44.681
Boy.
I know women can be scary.

210
00:28:44.681 --> 00:28:46.474
but do not give up.

211
00:28:49.018 --> 00:28:49.853
Ever!

212
00:28:52.689 --> 00:28:56.443
But if you do. well you
know. I get that too.

213
00:29:47.827 --> 00:29:48.620
- Hey!

214
00:29:52.499 --> 00:29:53.333
Magayon.

215
00:30:00.673 --> 00:30:02.091
Magayon. wait up!

216
00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:29.702
Thanks for not leaving me back there.

217
00:30:36.918 --> 00:30:40.672
So. um. I think we should
get out of this jungle.

218
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:44.175
Just find our bearings. then
find. find the volcano. right?

219
00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:45.844
And then we could...

220
00:30:48.137 --> 00:30:50.932
Unless. you know. you already
know where you're going.

221
00:30:51.891 --> 00:30:52.725
- Canada.

222
00:30:52.725 --> 00:30:53.560
- Huh?

223
00:30:56.604 --> 00:30:57.564
- Of course you do.

224
00:31:08.366 --> 00:31:09.242
Hey. hey!

225
00:31:26.342 --> 00:31:29.137
When
I was young. I was in love

226
00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:30.805
with this beautiful woman.

227
00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:37.729
I chased after her. tried to
walk her home every night.

228
00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:41.733
She was just so beautiful.

229
00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:44.736
I did this for 10 years before finally

230
00:31:46.154 --> 00:31:47.739
she broke my heart.

231
00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:53.077
And not long after that. I
met and married your mom.

232
00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:58.750
Sometimes beauty is dangerous. Anok.

233
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:03.296
Sometimes love can make you hold on

234
00:32:03.296 --> 00:32:06.007
when everything else is
telling you to let go.

235
00:33:27.755 --> 00:33:29.924
Remember to always ask permission.

236
00:33:29.924 --> 00:33:32.510
Wherever you walk. ask for permission.

237
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.845
If you're going to dig something

238
00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:37.223
or cut down something.
remember ask for permission.

239
00:33:40.143 --> 00:33:41.602
What did I just say?

240
00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:43.563
- Oh!

241
00:33:44.647 --> 00:33:46.399
Ah!

242
00:33:47.775 --> 00:33:49.944
Hey. okay. okay.

243
00:37:09.477 --> 00:37:10.978
No. no. no. stop. stop. stop!

244
00:37:10.978 --> 00:37:11.896
Ow. ow. ah!

245
00:37:15.107 --> 00:37:17.902
Stop. stop. no. look. it's just a phone!

246
00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:19.028
It's harmless.

247
00:37:20.112 --> 00:37:22.073
My mom. it's my mom. it's my mom!

248
00:37:22.949 --> 00:37:23.783
She's gone.

249
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:41.759
I should probably answer her. my mom.

250
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.347
We're not on the best of terms right now.

251
00:37:46.347 --> 00:37:48.432
but I'm sure she's worried sick about me.

252
00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:04.532
I have a hard time sleeping at night.

253
00:38:05.908 --> 00:38:08.160
I go through the same
thing every single day.

254
00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:11.998
come home exhausted
and I just fall asleep.

255
00:38:11.998 --> 00:38:14.000
Next thing you know. three hours later

256
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.001
you're still awake.

257
00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:18.713
And you're questioning every single choice

258
00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:20.214
you've ever made in your life.

259
00:38:21.507 --> 00:38:23.634
Sometimes. though. I
do get to fall asleep.

260
00:38:24.844 --> 00:38:27.138
But then I wake up in
the middle of the night.

261
00:38:29.056 --> 00:38:31.392
Although I wouldn't call it being awake.

262
00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:34.812
It's. it's weird. it's uh. kinda like.

263
00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:38.357
I can't feel my legs.

264
00:38:38.357 --> 00:38:42.278
My arms. my chest. it feels heavy.

265
00:38:42.278 --> 00:38:45.990
it's weird.

266
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:50.328
Strange thing is. I kinda
always feel that there's

267
00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:52.413
something in the room and I'm not alone.

268
00:38:57.668 --> 00:38:59.170
My dad used to tell me all of these

269
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.629
Filipino ghost stories.

270
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:04.425
There was this monster
that feeds on your fears

271
00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:08.471
and anxiety and insecurities.
and it follows you around.

272
00:39:08.471 --> 00:39:10.765
And it waits 'til you fall asleep.

273
00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:13.893
and that's when it strikes.

274
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.482
Suddenly it starts sucking
the life out of you.

275
00:39:19.482 --> 00:39:23.444
And eventually. the morning after.

276
00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:26.113
they'll find you there. dead.

277
00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:32.787
I know it's just the story.

278
00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:35.456
but sometimes I think
that's how my dad died.

279
00:39:39.794 --> 00:39:41.545
My dad. he was a doctor here.

280
00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.297
Everybody knew him.

281
00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:48.135
Back in Canada. though. he was a janitor

282
00:39:48.135 --> 00:39:52.139
during the weekdays. cargo
man on the weeknights.

283
00:39:55.476 --> 00:39:57.395
We could tell that he wasn't happy.

284
00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:03.859
My mom. she was the one
who convinced him to leave.

285
00:40:07.696 --> 00:40:11.784
And I guess a part of
my dad kinda regretted

286
00:40:11.784 --> 00:40:12.993
ever leaving this place.

287
00:40:17.164 --> 00:40:18.249
I kinda get why.

288
00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:37.953
- Canada!

289
00:41:37.953 --> 00:41:39.288
What?

290
00:41:39.288 --> 00:41:40.122
- Sh!

291
00:41:45.628 --> 00:41:48.047
Magayon. Magayon!

292
00:41:50.591 --> 00:41:51.425
Magayon!

293
00:41:55.596 --> 00:41:56.430
Magayon!

294
00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:20.037
Magayon!

295
00:42:38.347 --> 00:42:39.181
Magayon!

296
00:43:06.458 --> 00:43:08.002
I
used to believe in giants.

297
00:43:09.461 --> 00:43:12.590
My grandfather used to tell
me never to leave the house

298
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:13.841
during earthquakes because the Bungisngis

299
00:43:13.841 --> 00:43:16.760
would come and steal our cows.

300
00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:23.267
I would go out to look.
but I could never see them.

301
00:43:24.476 --> 00:43:25.561
I didn't have the third eye like he did.

302
00:43:27.896 --> 00:43:29.148
But could you believe it?

303
00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:32.901
Giants!

304
00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:41.952
- Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

305
00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:43.454
Wake up. wake up.

306
00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:45.539
We gotta get out of here.

307
00:43:46.373 --> 00:43:48.375
Let me start this thing.

308
00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:51.170
My grandfather said

309
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:52.921
they mostly left us alone.

310
00:43:55.341 --> 00:43:58.469
Unless they fall in love
with a beautiful woman.

311
00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.262
- Come on. please.

312
00:44:00.262 --> 00:44:01.930
Come on!

313
00:44:06.393 --> 00:44:07.478
Start. start!

314
00:44:17.905 --> 00:44:20.491
Come on. come. come on. faster.

315
00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:21.575
Move faster. please!

316
00:44:23.744 --> 00:44:26.747
Oh!

317
00:44:48.977 --> 00:44:51.021
What's it doing?

318
00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:52.523
Is it still there?

319
00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:01.407
Okay. okay!

320
00:45:01.407 --> 00:45:04.368
I think we lost him. I think--

321
00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:11.375
What the fuck!

322
00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:31.145
No. no. no. no. no. no. not now. not now!

323
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:31.979
Come on!

324
00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:54.501
I can't swim. I can't swim!

325
00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:00.752
- Canada. Canada.

326
00:49:17.162 --> 00:49:18.413
- Sorry. sorry.

327
00:49:19.748 --> 00:49:21.416
It's okay. I forgot.

328
00:50:01.123 --> 00:50:02.290
You all right?

329
00:50:34.322 --> 00:50:38.452
So um. I'm thinking if we
walk through the night.

330
00:50:38.452 --> 00:50:40.662
we'll probably get to
the base in the morning.

331
00:50:50.338 --> 00:50:52.132
What are you looking at?

332
00:50:59.222 --> 00:51:00.724
I could get used to this view.

333
00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:09.316
Sometimes.
Anok. it's just better

334
00:51:09.316 --> 00:51:10.400
to let go.

335
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.610
- Magayon. hey. Magayon!

336
00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:22.222
- Good morning. Sunshine!

337
00:52:22.222 --> 00:52:23.598
You from America?

338
00:52:23.598 --> 00:52:25.725
- Canada. common mistake.

339
00:52:31.898 --> 00:52:34.442
- So. why so far away?

340
00:52:34.442 --> 00:52:36.820
- Oh you know. I just wanted to get away.

341
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.238
- Get away?

342
00:52:38.238 --> 00:52:40.115
This place. it's so dangerous here.

343
00:52:40.115 --> 00:52:41.992
You don't know what is living out here.

344
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:43.160
- Yeah. like what?

345
00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:44.953
- Like sometimes I find footprints.

346
00:52:46.246 --> 00:52:47.414
There are footprints.

347
00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:49.624
One time I find one big footprint.

348
00:52:49.624 --> 00:52:52.210
You don't know imagine how big it is.

349
00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:53.962
- I don't think I can.

350
00:52:53.962 --> 00:52:57.132
You don't believe me.

351
00:52:57.132 --> 00:52:58.717
- No. I do.

352
00:52:58.717 --> 00:53:01.636
- Remember. better believe
than not to believe.

353
00:53:03.805 --> 00:53:06.308
One time I have this very good friend.

354
00:53:08.393 --> 00:53:09.477
Fish.

355
00:53:09.477 --> 00:53:10.437
Fish?

356
00:53:10.437 --> 00:53:11.229
- Yes. fish.

357
00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:17.402
They come by to see. but they only

358
00:53:19.946 --> 00:53:20.780
In the lake.

359
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:23.491
I told my friend. my friend.

360
00:53:27.621 --> 00:53:29.706
But my friend did not believe me.

361
00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:30.665
He did not listen.

362
00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:34.294
One time. he hungry.

363
00:53:36.796 --> 00:53:38.548
He bring it home. he cook it.

364
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.676
He cook it for his family.

365
00:53:43.011 --> 00:53:44.596
They ate it. and his son?

366
00:53:45.472 --> 00:53:49.267
He got. uh. sick. a nightmare.

367
00:53:49.267 --> 00:53:52.062
Then the next day. dead.

368
00:53:53.772 --> 00:53:57.150
So better believe than not to believe.

369
00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:22.092
- Stop the bus!

370
00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:24.135
Magayon. Magayon!

371
00:54:24.135 --> 00:54:25.637
Stop the bus!

372
00:54:37.023 --> 00:54:38.233
Hey. hey. no. no.

373
00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:39.901
We're not ignoring this anymore.

374
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:40.735
What's going on?

375
00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:46.324
Hey.

376
00:54:58.420 --> 00:54:59.379
Just about right.

377
00:55:02.716 --> 00:55:03.550
Huh?

378
00:55:04.551 --> 00:55:05.760
Not a lot. no.

379
00:55:08.888 --> 00:55:09.723
You can see her?

380
00:55:09.723 --> 00:55:11.391
I see you.

381
00:55:12.684 --> 00:55:13.893
My wife can see. too.

382
00:55:19.065 --> 00:55:21.276
Just like that every
day. almost every day.

383
00:55:28.074 --> 00:55:31.161
Why are you away from home that long?

384
00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:33.038
- Someone's chasing after her.

385
00:55:33.038 --> 00:55:33.872
- Huh?

386
00:55:44.132 --> 00:55:46.176
- Can you. can you help me take her home?

387
00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:47.010
- Oh no. no. no. no.

388
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:47.844
- What?

389
00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:48.678
- I don't want to get involved.

390
00:55:48.678 --> 00:55:49.637
- Why not?

391
00:55:49.637 --> 00:55:51.765
- No. no. listen.

392
00:55:51.765 --> 00:55:53.350
Magayon. powerful.

393
00:55:54.267 --> 00:55:56.936
Beautiful. but very powerful.

394
00:55:56.936 --> 00:56:00.273
They live their own life in the forest.

395
00:56:00.273 --> 00:56:01.107
You have your own life.

396
00:56:01.107 --> 00:56:03.651
Do not chase them. it will end badly.

397
00:56:10.575 --> 00:56:11.409
- It's broken.

398
00:56:11.409 --> 00:56:12.535
- Yes.

399
00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:17.540
Look. look.

400
00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:21.002
Somebody is waiting for us.

401
00:56:54.536 --> 00:56:55.370
- Ulap.

402
00:57:20.562 --> 00:57:21.688
- Look. look. look. look.

403
00:57:21.688 --> 00:57:23.815
I just want to see her home. okay buddy?

404
00:59:58.761 --> 00:59:59.596
- Hey!

405
01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:30.710
Oh!

406
01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:56.402
We're still too heavy.

407
01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.050
What do you think?

408
01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:10.953
Look. they were going to catch us.

409
01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.337
I couldn't let that happen. okay?

410
01:03:31.432 --> 01:03:32.975
This place looks pretty cool.

411
01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:35.478
Your handiwork?

412
01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:50.952
Oh you like that?

413
01:03:52.286 --> 01:03:54.664
So. you like it when
I sound like an idiot.

414
01:03:57.416 --> 01:03:58.751
I can work with that.

415
01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:20.940
Come on. work with me. give me something.

416
01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:30.408
Argh!

417
01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:33.619
Pagtuga angry!

418
01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:37.874
I love. love. I love.

419
01:04:47.633 --> 01:04:48.467
Okay.

420
01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:55.600
Jesus. it's not as if you're
gonna understand me anyway.

421
01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:03.858
I don't have much
waiting for me back home.

422
01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:06.903
It's not very easy for me.

423
01:05:13.367 --> 01:05:17.038
But being here. I kinda get why

424
01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:21.751
my dad missed this place so much.

425
01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.544
So easy to lose yourself.

426
01:05:26.547 --> 01:05:31.552
For the first time in a long
time. I can breathe again.

427
01:07:14.947 --> 01:07:16.365
Stay back. stay back.

428
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:45.603
Hey. hey. hey what are you doing?

429
01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:10.104
Jason.
Jason. Anok. wake up.

430
01:09:39.592 --> 01:09:42.011
We haven't talked in a while.

431
01:09:43.637 --> 01:09:48.642
but I need to tell you something.

432
01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:52.813
Jason. I'm sick.

433
01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.734
Your mom doesn't know yet.

434
01:09:59.236 --> 01:10:01.322
I don't know if I should tell her.

435
01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:09.955
I don't how to keep going.

436
01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:12.458
It's all just lies.

437
01:10:19.506 --> 01:10:23.844
And monsters in my stories.
they're just that. monsters.

438
01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:28.474
All of our lives we just end up

439
01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.309
killing ourselves in the end.

440
01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:31.143
- Magayon!

441
01:10:33.812 --> 01:10:35.189
Magayon!

442
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:37.733
I don't
know. Anok. I just don't.

443
01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:38.567
- Magayon!

444
01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.089
I don't know if you'll

445
01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.674
answer back in time.

446
01:11:03.884 --> 01:11:06.679
I know you're busy in the city.

447
01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:11.684
I just...

448
01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:43.799
I wanted to say I'm sorry I
won't get to keep my promise.

449
01:11:51.056 --> 01:11:53.392
Maybe one day you'll do it yourself.

450
01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.023
I hope you do.

451
01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:07.948
I waited so long to see home again.

452
01:12:10.617 --> 01:12:13.912
Every time it was a different excuse.

453
01:12:13.912 --> 01:12:16.623
and now I don't know if I
can even get on a plane.

454
01:12:35.392 --> 01:12:36.477
I miss it. Anok.

455
01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:39.605
I see it when I go to sleep.

456
01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:44.193
My dreams. I still see the mountains.

457
01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.945
the sunset. I smell the grass.

458
01:12:46.945 --> 01:12:48.989
I can breathe again. Anok.

459
01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:49.865
- Magayon?

460
01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:52.576
And
then I wake up in the cold

461
01:12:52.576 --> 01:12:53.619
in my apartment.

462
01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.079
- Magayon. hey.

463
01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:58.123
And
I try to go back to sleep

464
01:12:58.123 --> 01:13:00.542
just to see the mountains again.

465
01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:03.337
Maybe if I never left. I'd be happier.

466
01:13:03.337 --> 01:13:04.797
I wish I never left.

467
01:14:55.782 --> 01:14:56.617
- Magayon!

468
01:15:57.302 --> 01:15:58.136
Magayon!

469
01:19:02.487 --> 01:19:04.114
Oh no. no. no. no. no. no.

470
01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:05.490
Oh god.

471
01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:06.908
Oh god. oh god.

472
01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:09.911
Hey. oh shit. what can I do. oh god.

473
01:19:10.954 --> 01:19:14.875
Hey. look look look. look at
me. look at me. look at me.

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:17.210
It's gonna be fine. all right?

475
01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:19.421

We're we're we're we're gonna patch you up

477
01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.673
and you're gonna be fine.

478
01:19:26.219 --> 01:19:28.388
Hey. hey. help me carry her.

479
01:19:28.388 --> 01:19:29.306
Snap out of it!

480
01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:34.311
It's okay. it's okay. I'm gonna carry you.

481
01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:36.021
We're gonna fix this. all right?

482
01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:45.739
Oh shit. oh god.

483
01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:47.324

Just try one more.

Huh. no.

01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:12.557
No. no. no. I can do it.

01:20:12.557 --> 01:20:13.558
I can do it. I can do it.

491

I can help you. I can help you so much.

492

Yeah.

497
01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:55.679
Don't worry.

498
01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:58.264
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

499

One

your own kids to tell stories to. Anok.

511
01:25:06.518 --> 01:25:08.311
That'll be nice.

512
01:25:09.562 --> 01:25:13.399
Maybe one day they'll
want to go home. too.
