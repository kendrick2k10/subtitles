3
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.202
What reality garbage
are you watching now?

4
00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:15.787
"The Cleansing Hour".

5
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.415
You've never heard of
"Father Lance"?!

6
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:20.000
Every week. an incredible
deliverance!

7
00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:23.879
Is that what they call
special effects these days?

8
00:08:24.671 --> 00:08:25.464
Here.

9
00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:27.799
You're gonna like this.

10
00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:29.176
I like "The Mindy Project".

11
00:08:30.928 --> 00:08:32.638
Don't you want to witness
divine intervention?

12
00:13:56.003 --> 00:13:57.588
Are you seeing this?

13
00:42:56.368 --> 00:42:58.495
It's nice we can choose
the clothes together.

14
00:42:59.204 --> 00:43:00.706
We're so lucky

15
00:43:00.747 --> 00:43:02.875
not everybody can do that.

16
00:43:02.916 --> 00:43:05.669
It'll be big on you.
but I'd like you to wear

17
00:43:05.711 --> 00:43:06.962
my father's suit.

18
00:43:07.004 --> 00:43:08.046
What do you think?

19
00:43:10.507 --> 00:43:11.341
I don't care.

20
00:43:11.383 --> 00:43:12.176
I'll wear whatever.

21
00:43:12.217 --> 00:43:15.012
No. you must look smart.

22
00:43:15.053 --> 00:43:16.847
It's an important day for me.

23
00:43:16.889 --> 00:43:19.933
Lots of people are coming.
you must look perfect.

24
00:43:19.975 --> 00:43:22.686
Then just choose
my clothes for me.

25
00:43:22.728 --> 00:43:23.896
I'm not in the mood.

26
00:43:23.937 --> 00:43:24.730
Shoes?

27
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:29.526
The brown ones are nicer. right?

28
00:43:29.568 --> 00:43:32.112
Those ones rub
and give me sores.

29
00:43:32.988 --> 00:43:34.865
I prefer the black ones.

30
00:43:34.907 --> 00:43:35.616
These ones.

31
00:43:35.657 --> 00:43:37.951
They're newer.

32
00:43:37.993 --> 00:43:41.288
They're newer because
I never wear them.

33
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:42.206
They rub.

34
00:43:42.247 --> 00:43:44.625
Then put some plasters on.

35
00:43:44.666 --> 00:43:47.211
Why ask me which shoes I want
if you're going

36
00:43:47.252 --> 00:43:48.712
to choose them yourself?

37
00:43:48.754 --> 00:43:50.422
Which tie?

38
00:43:50.464 --> 00:43:51.715
I like these two.

39
00:43:52.758 --> 00:43:54.843
I don't like wearing a tie.

40
00:43:54.885 --> 00:43:57.095
I never wear a tie.

41
00:43:57.137 --> 00:43:58.096
It's not my style.

42
00:43:58.805 --> 00:43:59.640
Style!

43
00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:02.184
Style What's your style?

44
00:44:03.352 --> 00:44:04.978
You look like a rustic.

45
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.898
I am a rustic and I like
the way I look. okay?

46
00:44:09.775 --> 00:44:12.027
Shave that beard off.

47
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:14.071
You're not going
with that great beard.

48
00:44:14.112 --> 00:44:16.990
You're not touching
my great beard.

49
00:44:17.032 --> 00:44:19.535
I was practically
born with a beard.

50
00:44:19.576 --> 00:44:21.954
You met me with this beard.

51
00:44:21.995 --> 00:44:25.457
That beard is
going and that's that.

52
00:44:25.499 --> 00:44:28.710
Don't you dare
I mean it. okay?

53
00:44:33.799 --> 00:44:34.758
Darling.

54
00:44:39.388 --> 00:44:40.264
That beard.

55
00:44:41.974 --> 00:44:43.433
That beard it's disgusting.

56
00:44:45.018 --> 00:44:45.936
It doesn't suit you.

57
00:44:47.145 --> 00:44:48.188
It never has.

58
00:44:50.274 --> 00:44:52.568
These clothes
that we're choosing

59
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:54.862
you'll be wearing for eternity.

60
00:44:54.903 --> 00:44:56.196
We don't have much time

61
00:44:56.238 --> 00:45:00.534
so make an effort and
help me with all of this.

62
00:45:01.618 --> 00:45:03.203
You're the star.

63
00:45:03.245 --> 00:45:04.496
Lots of people are coming

64
00:45:04.538 --> 00:45:07.416
to see you one last
time at your wake.

65
00:45:07.457 --> 00:45:10.919
So I want you to look
handsome and radiant.

66
00:45:10.961 --> 00:45:12.713
They'll think that I've dressed
you badly because

67
00:45:12.754 --> 00:45:14.631
you're a simple villager.

68
00:45:14.673 --> 00:45:18.010
But that's what I am.

69
00:45:18.051 --> 00:45:20.888
That's how I want
people to remember me.

70
00:45:20.929 --> 00:45:22.890
With my shirts

71
00:45:22.931 --> 00:45:24.641
with tracksuit bottoms

72
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.852
and. above all

73
00:45:26.894 --> 00:45:27.811
with my beard.

74
00:45:29.354 --> 00:45:31.023
Don't touch my beard. okay?

75
00:45:32.107 --> 00:45:34.651
I have to get the flowers

76
00:45:34.693 --> 00:45:37.237
the coffin and
call the last guests.

77
00:45:37.279 --> 00:45:39.406
The burial is in three days.

78
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:42.117
So don't be selfish.

79
00:45:42.159 --> 00:45:43.744
Cooperate a little. please.

80
00:45:43.785 --> 00:45:45.245
Darling

81
00:45:45.287 --> 00:45:48.332
why don't you just wait until
I die and you can do it

82
00:45:48.373 --> 00:45:49.583
as you like.

83
00:45:49.625 --> 00:45:53.921
Darling. I don't like
to remind you but

84
00:45:53.962 --> 00:45:56.298
the doctor said you have
less than 48 hours left.

85
00:45:57.132 --> 00:45:58.258
What if he's wrong?

86
00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:01.470
He won't be wrong.

87
00:46:34.503 --> 00:46:36.213
He looks so smart.

88
00:46:36.255 --> 00:46:38.215
Are the clothes his?

89
00:46:38.257 --> 00:46:40.509
Or are they from the funeral
home?

90
00:46:40.551 --> 00:46:42.928
It's my father's suit.

91
00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:45.639
We chose it together
for the occasion.

92
00:46:46.431 --> 00:46:49.101
Rest assured. dear.

93
00:46:49.142 --> 00:46:51.937
He's more handsome
dead than he was alive.

94
00:46:51.979 --> 00:46:55.482
A little too much make-up
though. don't you think?

95
00:46:55.524 --> 00:46:58.652
If not he'd be white and
would give us the chills

96
00:46:58.694 --> 00:47:01.697
but I think it's a
complete waste of time.

97
00:47:01.738 --> 00:47:03.824
He'll start to rot
in a few hours.

98
00:47:03.866 --> 00:47:06.034
He looks better without a beard.

99
00:47:06.076 --> 00:47:07.536
He looks younger.

100
00:47:07.578 --> 00:47:09.371
He's unrecognizable
without it.

101
00:47:09.413 --> 00:47:10.706
He looks gay.

102
00:47:10.747 --> 00:47:13.500
I always told him to shave.

103
00:47:13.542 --> 00:47:16.128
Without that beard.
he's so handsome.

104
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.838
He looks like a fairy.

105
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.881
Why did you shave him?

106
00:47:21.091 --> 00:47:22.426
It was one of his last requests.

107
00:47:25.846 --> 00:47:29.183
If you don't mind. could
you join the others?

108
00:47:29.224 --> 00:47:30.893
I'd like to be alone with him.

109
00:47:59.087 --> 00:48:05.719
Darling!

110
00:48:05.761 --> 00:48:07.137
What the hell are
you doing alive?

111
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:08.805
I don't know.

112
00:48:09.515 --> 00:48:11.183
I just woke up.

113
00:48:11.225 --> 00:48:12.726
My God. what a shock.

114
00:48:12.768 --> 00:48:13.936
How can this be?

115
00:48:13.977 --> 00:48:17.022
The doctor confirmed your death
a few hours ago.

116
00:48:17.064 --> 00:48:19.358
He confirmed it badly then.

117
00:48:19.399 --> 00:48:21.026
Because. as you can see.

118
00:48:21.068 --> 00:48:22.277
I'm alive.

119
00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:25.322
I feel absolutely fine.

120
00:48:25.364 --> 00:48:27.032
We're burying you in an hour.

121
00:48:29.076 --> 00:48:31.453
Your friends are here.
it's all ready.

122
00:48:31.495 --> 00:48:33.914
Even people who don't like
you came.

123
00:48:35.624 --> 00:48:38.418
We'll cancel it that's that.

124
00:48:39.711 --> 00:48:43.590
I'll go out right now
and explain it all.

125
00:48:43.632 --> 00:48:44.883
Are you crazy?

126
00:48:44.925 --> 00:48:47.052
It's been a lot of trouble.

127
00:48:47.094 --> 00:48:48.262
There are hundreds of people.

128
00:48:48.303 --> 00:48:50.597
There are high expectations.

129
00:48:50.639 --> 00:48:51.807
That many people came?

130
00:48:52.891 --> 00:48:53.892
It's a success.

131
00:48:55.269 --> 00:48:57.062
I've always been a popular guy.

132
00:48:58.772 --> 00:49:01.692
They'll be happy I'm alive.

133
00:49:01.733 --> 00:49:03.068
Darling

134
00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:04.778
I'm your wife and I love you

135
00:49:05.737 --> 00:49:07.573
but it's too late now.

136
00:49:07.614 --> 00:49:08.866
We're used to the idea now.

137
00:49:10.158 --> 00:49:11.451
What do you mean?

138
00:49:11.493 --> 00:49:13.787
We can't lose face.

139
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:14.872
We'd look stupid.

140
00:49:14.913 --> 00:49:16.874
I'd be a laughing stock.

141
00:49:19.293 --> 00:49:20.752
There's a lot at stake.

142
00:49:21.837 --> 00:49:22.504
What do you mean?

143
00:49:22.546 --> 00:49:24.631
You have to die.

144
00:49:24.673 --> 00:49:26.842
You can't just
resurrect like this.

145
00:49:26.884 --> 00:49:28.218
Are you serious?

146
00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.261
Of course.

147
00:49:31.555 --> 00:49:34.641
Shit You can't do this to me.

148
00:49:34.683 --> 00:49:36.476
Juan. don't talk back to me.

149
00:49:36.518 --> 00:49:38.020
Your mother is here.

150
00:49:38.061 --> 00:49:40.480
My parents are on their way.

151
00:49:40.522 --> 00:49:43.150
When they arrive. they
want you dead and buried.

152
00:49:43.192 --> 00:49:44.568
We can't let them down.

153
00:49:44.610 --> 00:49:46.737
I don't want to die yet.

154
00:49:47.988 --> 00:49:49.239
I'm not ready.

155
00:49:50.782 --> 00:49:51.366
Darling.

156
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:53.827
Do you love me?

157
00:49:54.494 --> 00:49:55.454
Yes.

158
00:49:55.495 --> 00:49:57.331
Well. if you really love me

159
00:49:57.372 --> 00:49:58.040
die.

160
00:50:00.709 --> 00:50:02.169
You want me to kill myself?

161
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.718
My little boy.

162
00:50:12.513 --> 00:50:13.889
My little boy's gone.

163
00:50:15.849 --> 00:50:19.186
Faustina. don't fuss over
him you'll crease his suit.

164
00:50:21.605 --> 00:50:22.356
Goodness me.

165
00:50:23.607 --> 00:50:25.692
He's so handsome
without his beard.

166
00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.529
You shaved my beard in the end.

167
00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:30.822
What are you doing alive?

168
00:50:30.864 --> 00:50:32.741
I don't know but
I've woken up.

169
00:50:32.783 --> 00:50:34.409
See?

170
00:50:34.451 --> 00:50:36.036
Fresh as a daisy.

171
00:50:36.078 --> 00:50:37.204
It's a miracle!

172
00:50:37.246 --> 00:50:38.080
Yes.

173
00:50:38.747 --> 00:50:40.999
Of course. I said that to her:

174
00:50:41.041 --> 00:50:44.920
"It's a miracle". but

175
00:50:44.962 --> 00:50:48.507
now I want to go outside and
give everybody the good news.

176
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:50.175
But she won't let me.

177
00:50:50.217 --> 00:50:52.678
She says I have to die.

178
00:50:52.719 --> 00:50:54.346
He wants to cancel the funeral.

179
00:50:54.388 --> 00:50:57.391
He says he doesn't want
to be buried until he's dead.

180
00:50:57.432 --> 00:50:58.809
Cancel the funeral?

181
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.895
Are you crazy?

182
00:51:01.937 --> 00:51:04.273
Do you know the
amount of people here?

183
00:51:05.315 --> 00:51:07.609
It's the funeral of the year.

184
00:51:08.527 --> 00:51:10.070
It cannot be canceled.

185
00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.447
But. Mum?

186
00:51:12.489 --> 00:51:14.741
Don't "mum" me.

187
00:51:14.783 --> 00:51:16.410
You'll be buried
today and that's that.

188
00:51:17.828 --> 00:51:20.956
We can't lose face
with everybody.

189
00:51:20.998 --> 00:51:23.959
But I don't want to die. Mum.

190
00:51:24.001 --> 00:51:25.085
Son.

191
00:51:25.127 --> 00:51:26.295
don't be selfish.

192
00:51:26.336 --> 00:51:28.839
You have less than one hour

193
00:51:28.881 --> 00:51:29.882
to die.

194
00:51:30.757 --> 00:51:32.050
What rotten luck.

195
00:51:35.012 --> 00:51:36.388
How am I supposed to do it?

196
00:51:38.056 --> 00:51:40.267
I don't know.

197
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:43.228
I don't know Hold your breath
like when you have the hiccups.

198
00:51:44.688 --> 00:51:45.522
Hiccups?

199
00:52:07.878 --> 00:52:08.712
I can't.

200
00:52:09.338 --> 00:52:09.838
I can't.

201
00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:10.964
I'm suffocating.

202
00:52:11.006 --> 00:52:11.924
Darling. that's the idea.

203
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.092
I don't like it.

204
00:52:16.011 --> 00:52:17.721
Think of another way.
I don't like this one.

205
00:52:18.972 --> 00:52:19.806
Don't cry.

206
00:52:19.848 --> 00:52:21.850
Cooperate a little. son!

207
00:52:23.852 --> 00:52:26.522
If you want me to die
then think of something else.

208
00:52:28.106 --> 00:52:29.775
Why don't you cut your veins?

209
00:52:46.041 --> 00:52:47.292
How's it going. darling?

210
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:53.006
I feel a little dizzy

211
00:52:53.966 --> 00:52:55.759
but that's about it.

212
00:52:55.801 --> 00:52:58.929
The funeral workers are coming
in 30 minutes.

213
00:52:58.971 --> 00:53:00.764
they can't find him like this!

214
00:53:01.557 --> 00:53:03.559
Marisa. darling?

215
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.186
Go to the kitchen. get
the carving knife and stab me

216
00:53:06.228 --> 00:53:07.604
as many times as it takes.

217
00:53:08.313 --> 00:53:09.106
Me?

218
00:53:09.147 --> 00:53:10.148
Stab you?

219
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:13.318
How can he be so macabre?

220
00:53:45.184 --> 00:53:45.976
I can't take anymore.

221
00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.020
Come on.

222
00:53:49.146 --> 00:53:50.022
Harder.

223
00:53:51.023 --> 00:53:52.024
You won't die.

224
00:53:54.026 --> 00:53:55.485
Don't you feel anything?

225
00:53:55.527 --> 00:53:56.486
My dear

226
00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:00.574
my stomach hurts. but

227
00:54:00.616 --> 00:54:02.326
I think I'm just nervous.

228
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:04.077
Damn it. Juanito.

229
00:54:04.119 --> 00:54:04.912
Just die!

230
00:54:07.706 --> 00:54:08.832
How's it going?

231
00:54:08.874 --> 00:54:09.583
Mum!

232
00:54:09.625 --> 00:54:10.876
We're running out of time.

233
00:54:10.918 --> 00:54:12.002
People are impatient.

234
00:54:14.963 --> 00:54:17.174
This bastard
doesn't want to die.

235
00:54:17.216 --> 00:54:18.091
I'll help.

236
00:54:18.133 --> 00:54:19.718
I found this in the kitchen.

237
00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.928
Mum?

238
00:54:20.969 --> 00:54:22.221
What are you going to do?

239
00:54:24.515 --> 00:54:26.475
You keep stabbing him.

240
00:54:26.517 --> 00:54:29.061
I'm going to whisk his stomach.

241
00:54:35.442 --> 00:54:37.361
It's disgusting!

242
00:54:37.402 --> 00:54:39.279
Life is disgusting

243
00:54:41.657 --> 00:54:42.908
death more so.

244
00:54:45.619 --> 00:54:46.745
What beautiful words. Mum.

245
00:55:05.264 --> 00:55:07.057
Why are you smoking?

246
00:55:07.933 --> 00:55:08.934
Smoking kills.

247
00:55:10.769 --> 00:55:12.563
It'll take hours for
him to bleed out.

248
00:55:14.189 --> 00:55:15.190
It's not working.

249
00:55:17.025 --> 00:55:20.028
But the blood
is perfectly fluffy.

250
00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:20.821
Fantastic.

251
00:55:26.869 --> 00:55:27.786
Look at it all.

252
00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.710
I didn't want to let anyone
down and now it's a disaster.

253
00:55:39.173 --> 00:55:40.799
I gave my life
preparing this funeral

254
00:55:42.176 --> 00:55:43.135
for nothing.

255
00:55:50.475 --> 00:55:51.894
Who will clean all this blood?

256
00:55:53.228 --> 00:55:54.730
What will we say?

257
00:55:54.771 --> 00:55:55.939
What will they think of us?

258
00:55:56.773 --> 00:55:57.774
Look!

259
00:55:57.816 --> 00:55:59.193
Look at our dresses

260
00:55:59.234 --> 00:56:00.777
and what we've
done to your son.

261
00:56:02.487 --> 00:56:04.031
What do we look like?

262
00:56:04.072 --> 00:56:05.407
You look like what you are:

263
00:56:06.825 --> 00:56:07.576
Two fucking psychopaths.

264
00:56:12.539 --> 00:56:13.957
How dare you insult your mother.

265
00:56:15.876 --> 00:56:17.336
Who does he think he is?

266
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:19.463
Some manners!

267
00:56:23.175 --> 00:56:24.009
He's not moving.

268
00:56:25.385 --> 00:56:25.928
What?

269
00:56:27.179 --> 00:56:28.180
He's not moving

270
00:56:33.727 --> 00:56:34.603
or breathing.

271
00:56:35.771 --> 00:56:37.147
Are you sure?

272
00:56:37.189 --> 00:56:38.148
Yes

273
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:39.316
yes.

274
00:56:39.358 --> 00:56:40.609
I think you killed him.

275
00:56:42.569 --> 00:56:44.446
I killed

276
00:56:44.488 --> 00:56:45.906
my son?

277
00:56:45.948 --> 00:56:47.115
Yes. Faustina.

278
00:56:47.157 --> 00:56:48.116
You killed him!

279
00:56:48.158 --> 00:56:48.742
You killed him!

280
00:56:48.784 --> 00:56:49.368
No.

281
00:56:49.409 --> 00:56:51.662
I can't have done.

282
00:56:51.703 --> 00:56:54.540
Not my son. no.

283
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:56.542
But Faustina. isn't
this what we wanted?

284
00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:00.921
The worst thing that
can happen to a mother

285
00:57:00.963 --> 00:57:02.422
is to lose her child!

286
00:57:08.011 --> 00:57:09.847
But. at least

287
00:57:09.888 --> 00:57:12.224
we don't have to
cancel the ceremony.

288
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:28.073
I think I scared them.

289
00:57:30.492 --> 00:57:32.995
They didn't recognize
me without my beard.

290
00:57:33.036 --> 00:57:34.162
What do we do now?

291
00:57:52.472 --> 00:57:53.765
Why can't I die?

292
00:57:54.683 --> 00:57:56.685
Why can't I die?!

293
00:59:24.314 --> 00:59:25.983
Dr Gonzalez.
please go to surgery.

294
00:59:58.182 --> 01:00:00.017
Now what? you fucking gringo.

295
01:00:00.058 --> 01:00:01.435
I have my green card!

296
01:00:08.984 --> 01:00:09.943
Well yeah.

297
01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:12.029
You can help me.
give me my job back.

298
01:00:14.823 --> 01:00:16.074
What the fuck did you do?

299
01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:17.117
What the fuck did you do?

300
01:00:17.159 --> 01:00:18.577
You destroyed my car.
fucking gringo!

301
01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:29.004
And the gringo wants
to charge us for the wall.

302
01:00:29.046 --> 01:00:31.298
Tell him no.
fucking racist gringo!

303
01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:32.424
We won't pay you shit!

304
01:00:49.274 --> 01:00:50.484
Mr. Trump

305
01:00:50.526 --> 01:00:53.153
look. we are
honest people and

306
01:00:53.195 --> 01:00:54.530
we only want to ask you to...

307
01:01:35.988 --> 01:01:37.698
Who changed my case?

308
01:01:37.739 --> 01:01:39.533
Who did you steal this from?

309
01:01:39.575 --> 01:01:41.827
Well. it was there

310
01:01:45.163 --> 01:01:46.999
Play the guitar!

311
01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.459
Sing something. but in
English. or he won't understand.

312
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:05.392
Come here Mr. diplomat.

313
01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:07.644
It's up to you to demand him

314
01:02:07.686 --> 01:02:08.645
put it on!

315
01:02:09.605 --> 01:02:11.231
If you don't

316
01:02:11.273 --> 01:02:14.610
he'll step over our people
and destroy our culture.

317
01:02:18.614 --> 01:02:20.115
Go. hurry up!

318
01:02:25.996 --> 01:02:27.998
Now. who could save us?

319
01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:38.383
Hey what's that?

320
01:02:38.425 --> 01:02:39.885
It's a miracle!

321
01:02:41.303 --> 01:02:43.096
It's quetzalcoatl.

322
01:02:43.138 --> 01:02:44.723
Is it the hail Mary?

323
01:02:46.725 --> 01:02:48.143
It is the hail Mary!

324
01:03:07.579 --> 01:03:09.706
Hell yeah motherfucker!
