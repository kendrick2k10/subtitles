when we first moved there.

because I think that shelter
was the worst shelter we've been in.

169
00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:15.930
[indistinct chatter]

170
00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:21.769
[Coach Jean] Listen. Hello!

171
00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:25.147
Those sticks were terrible. Terrible.

172
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.190
Terrible.

173
00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:28.776
Rainn. you were standing
here to get the stick.

174
00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:30.361
Where did you get stick at?

175
00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:32.905
-[Rainn] Right there.
-[Coach Jean] Right there.

176
00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.574
She had to slow down to give the…

177
00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:36.826
{\an8}And she's like this
trying to get you the stick

178
00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:40.663
{\an8}because you're standing there
like the Statue of Liberty.

179
00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:42.582
You have to move.

180
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.668
and that's something that you learn where?

181
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.503
-[Vanesha] Practice.
-At practice. Yes!

182
00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:48.879
That's why it's called practice.

183
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.632
Yay for Vanesha! She's so smart.

184
00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.260
You have to pull
your girl through the zone.

185
00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:58.639
That will encourage the girl
to run harder at the end of the race.

186
00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:04.812
Make sure you are standing
with your left hand in a V. V.

187
00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:07.315
[girl] Like this. V? V. like this?

188
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.693
[Coach Jean] How would
the girls describe me?

189
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.823
Mean. nice. loud.

190
00:10:15.906 --> 00:10:18.826
Okay. look behind you
to see who you are passing…

191
00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:21.495
Caring. Fun.

192
00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.124
Scary. [laughs]

193
00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:27.376
I think that's some
of the words they would use.

194
00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:29.879
Okay. everybody move down here.

195
00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.213
and let's try this again.

196
00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:34.467
The Sheppards are a special case.

197
00:10:35.384 --> 00:10:38.971
Seven months after they started
with me. they lost their apartment.

198
00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:41.474
and I was… I was shocked.

199
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.227
And I knew that I had to try to help.

200
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:46.437
and I didn't know how.

201
00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:51.484
But I've been learning a lot since then.

202
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.527
Got it.

203
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.945
Right there.

204
00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:56.781
I grew up in the projects.

205
00:10:57.573 --> 00:10:58.991
I always said to myself.

206
00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:02.078
"I'm not always going
to live in the projects. I'm not."

207
00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:09.585
For me. I always felt like
I can do whatever I put my mind to.

208
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.212
I can do whatever I want.

209
00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.925
These girls have to have that same feeling

210
00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:18.803
that they can do whatever they want to do.

211
00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:23.057
but they have to understand
that education is the key.

212
00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.768
and that's the only way
they're going to make it.

213
00:11:28.145 --> 00:11:32.733
Okay. drop off two laps.
and then report for donuts.

214
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:40.449
This is the hardest working
team on the East Coast.

215
00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.909
I'm telling you right now.

216
00:11:41.992 --> 00:11:45.121
You are not going to find
a harder working team than this team.

217
00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:47.706
Some of you.
your daughters may not make it.

218
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.168
because this is like
you getting out of high school

219
00:11:51.252 --> 00:11:54.547
and applying
to Harvard and not getting in.

220
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.507
but maybe you could go to Penn State.

221
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.050
It's still a good school.

222
00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:01.720
"Parents are responsible
for submitting a copy of their daughter's

223
00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:05.808
report cards to the coaches
and staying on top of their grades

224
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:10.980
because the object of the team
is to get them an athletic scholarship

225
00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:15.109
so that they can go off to college.
and you don't have to put out money."

226
00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:16.735
That is the goal.

227
00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:19.071
If you want your daughter
to go to the Olympics.

228
00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:21.031
then you're in the wrong place.

229
00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:24.910
Higher education is our ultimate goal.

230
00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:29.081
Recently. we have come into some grants

231
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.750
that have been awarded
to us and some gifts

232
00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.753
because we had three
super athletes on the team

233
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:37.548
who were named
<i>Sports Illustrated</i> "Kids of the Year."

234
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:40.134
That's their mother
Tonia Handy right there.

235
00:12:40.217 --> 00:12:41.886
[cheering and applauding]

236
00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:44.472
[Coach Jean] Thank you. Now you gotta
get your daughters to running.

237
00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:49.727
[Tonia] I've been
almost four years on this job.

238
00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:53.147
I'm now getting minimum wage.

239
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.484
I'm looking at the interviews
I'm going on and the pay.

240
00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:59.028
and if I had one of these jobs.

241
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.238
it wouldn't be this bad.

242
00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.910
I'm getting paid literally
now minimum wage.

243
00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:08.287
now that minimum wage is $10.50.

244
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.748
That's what I'm getting where I'm working.

245
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:17.338
I've been on a couple of interviews
in the last couple of months.

246
00:13:17.421 --> 00:13:22.301
last few months. I should say.
and I haven't gotten a better job.

247
00:13:25.012 --> 00:13:27.097
I don't want to be
too nervous at the interview.

248
00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:28.098
I really don't.

249
00:13:28.182 --> 00:13:30.935
I want to be more relaxed. you know?

250
00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:37.274
Right now. with Mr. Perry
paying the rent. it's just basically…

251
00:13:37.358 --> 00:13:38.651
I'm putting it in savings.

252
00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:43.656
and so when it's done.
I'll have to pay my own rent.

253
00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:48.160
So a lot of things
will be. I guess. cut in half.

254
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.790
In order for me to save
the way I would like to.

255
00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:56.961
I would have to get a better job.
maybe go back to school.

256
00:13:58.546 --> 00:13:59.922
I'll just save what I can.

257
00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:05.928
Kick. kick. kick…

258
00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:11.600
Left. right. left.
right. left. right. left.

259
00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:16.647
There are people here
who do not have their grades together.

260
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.774
If your grades are not together.

261
00:14:18.857 --> 00:14:22.278
then you are
going to be sat down for the season

262
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.405
until you get your grades together.

263
00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:30.035
Did you get a message before me?

264
00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:33.080
{\an8}Yeah. I forgot. My mom told me today.

265
00:14:33.163 --> 00:14:34.373
{\an8}-You forgot?
-Yeah.

266
00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:38.460
-[Coach Karel] Mr. Joseph. 74. Okay.
-[Rainn] Mmm-hmm.

267
00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.379
[Coach Karel] That's not
terrible grades. Rainn.

268
00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:43.757
This is what's not good because
you're "talking too much in class."

269
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.467
[male coach] Get out of lane two!

270
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.844
-"Missing work."
-[female coach] Tami…

271
00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:48.554
-That's unacceptable.
-[female coach] Go in front!

272
00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:51.223
That means you don't want to run. Right?

273
00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.309
[male coach] Every time you're
in lane two. you should pass.

274
00:14:53.392 --> 00:14:55.853
-You don't want to run?
-I do wanna run.

275
00:14:55.936 --> 00:14:59.315
Then you better show.
We're not here playing games. Rainn.

276
00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:02.693
The next step is you'll be out
for the season. Do you hear me?

277
00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:08.157
So you better let
this be a lesson… in getting humble.

278
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.659
If this is too much for you.
then you'll just do school.

279
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.745
that's the most important thing.
Do you hear me?

280
00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:13.829
Yeah. [sniffling]

281
00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:17.625
Yeah. it hurts not to be out here. right?

282
00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:22.296
-Is this mine or yours?
-You can have it.

283
00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:24.715
Okay. Go ahead. Back to work.

284
00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:30.721
No training and no running.

285
00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:31.889
3:41.

286
00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:34.892
[indistinct chatter]

287
00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:37.937
There's a three and…

288
00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:41.815
{\an8}Why does your teacher
give so much homework?

289
00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:45.486
This one is easy homework.
Usually he gives me hard homework.

290
00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:47.196
My homework was easy.

291
00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:51.951
…21. 22. 23. 24.

292
00:15:52.034 --> 00:15:53.953
[indistinct shouting]

293
00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:00.000
[Coach Jean] Girls are always the same.

294
00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:02.670
Girls start out sweet.

295
00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:06.715
They turn a little crazy
when they're 13. 14. and 15.

296
00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:09.718
and then they come
to their senses with my help.

297
00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:12.221
[chuckles]

298
00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:19.812
Jeuness means to me
promise and hope for the future.

299
00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:22.690
for our kids.
and peace of mind for myself.

300
00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:27.111
-[announcer] On your mark!
-[starting shot fires]

301
00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:34.326
[Coach Jean] When I started the team.
I was just coaching.

302
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.497
but after a while I realized
that when girls got older.

303
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.167
they would say. "Oh. that was
the greatest experience of my life."

304
00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:43.419
[chuckles softly]

305
00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:46.755
So I realized
that there was more going on.

306
00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:48.257
You look good today. Brookie.

307
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.758
That's why I'm saving it.

308
00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:51.719
Sonic. [laughing]

309
00:16:51.802 --> 00:16:53.846
What's at stake is their whole life

310
00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:55.764
and where they go with it.

311
00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:57.016
[indistinct shouting]

312
00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:59.143
[Coach Jean] Stay off the streets.

313
00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:01.186
Stay away from drugs.

314
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.564
Stay away from teen pregnancy.

315
00:17:04.231 --> 00:17:06.066
And it's an everyday struggle.

316
00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:12.364
The most important thing I give
the girls is a sense of empowerment.

317
00:17:13.407 --> 00:17:17.828
They get that by being part
of something bigger than themselves.

318
00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:21.623
and setting goals.
and reaching those goals.

319
00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:24.710
and not taking no for an answer.

320
00:17:25.794 --> 00:17:28.505
[all] JTC4L!

321
00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:31.300
And that would take them far.

322
00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:39.892
♪ <i>It's got feeling… ♪</i>

323
00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:42.394
You know this song? Oh. gosh. [giggles]

324
00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:43.520
It was a movie.

325
00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:45.355
♪ <i>The places… ♪</i>

326
00:17:47.775 --> 00:17:50.110
[Coach Jean] <i>When they</i>
<i>first came on the team.</i>

327
00:17:50.194 --> 00:17:51.779
<i>they were a hot mess.</i>

328
00:17:53.197 --> 00:17:56.158
<i>They didn't know anything about track.</i>

329
00:17:57.993 --> 00:17:59.369
<i>It's good that we got a chance</i>

330
00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:02.164
<i>to come here</i>
<i>just to broaden their horizons.</i>

331
00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:05.042
<i>so they can see</i>
<i>that there's a whole world out there.</i>

332
00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:06.877
<i>and they can be part of it.</i>

333
00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:10.422
[Brooke] Am I forgetting something?

334
00:18:10.506 --> 00:18:12.382
[giggling]

335
00:18:12.466 --> 00:18:13.675
I'm going to have to call.

336
00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.844
Okay. keep it quiet

[Brooke] Rainn. how do you feel?
You're 13.

508
00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:42.911
[Coach Jean] Yeah. Rainn.
How do you feel? You're 13.

509
00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:44.954
A happy birthday.

510
00:27:45.038 --> 00:27:46.748
{\an8}Thirteen. thirteen. Rainn drop.

511
00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:51.086
-When did you get this?
-[Coach Jean laughing]

512
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:53.588
Before or after
I'm yelling at you all day.

513
00:27:54.964 --> 00:27:56.007
It is so good.

514
00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:57.008
[Coach Jean] Yeah?

515
00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:57.926
[Rainn] It is good.

516
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.845
[indistinct chatter]

517
00:28:01.971 --> 00:28:03.807
[Miss Orapullo] All right. ladies.

518
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.060
with the exception
of Tai. it is lunch time.

519
00:28:07.143 --> 00:28:10.313
I don't want you to miss lunch. all right?

520
00:28:11.606 --> 00:28:13.316
Tai. why weren't you in school yesterday?

521
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.151
[Tai] I was cleaning. That's it.

522
00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:19.072
You were cleaning.
so you didn't come to school yesterday?

523
00:28:19.155 --> 00:28:22.325
Mmm-hmm. That's it. I was cleaning
the whole house. It took hours.

524
00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:25.286
[Miss Orapullo] So what did you miss
as a result of staying home?

525
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.288
Nothing. 'Cause I already know
what we're doing--

526
00:28:27.372 --> 00:28:29.624
-I could pull up your progress report.
-Oh. sure.

527
00:28:29.707 --> 00:28:31.167
How do you think you're doing?

528
00:28:31.251 --> 00:28:32.127
Hmm.

529
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.711
Math. you have an 80.

530
00:28:33.795 --> 00:28:36.965
{\an8}Great science grade. Fabulous art grade.

531
00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:38.299
{\an8}Mmm.

532
00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:40.635
-You need to be in school.
-That's 'cause I finished the project.

533
00:28:40.718 --> 00:28:41.761
Let's see.

534
00:28:41.845 --> 00:28:43.346
I got my TAKS test results back.

535
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.014
-I did okay.
-[Miss Orapullo] You did pretty good?

536
00:28:45.098 --> 00:28:48.643
I got a hundred something in ELA .
and the rest was 800.

537
00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:49.853
[Miss Orapullo] That's awesome.

538
00:28:49.936 --> 00:28:54.524
How that works. too.
is you can get money for how you test.

539
00:28:54.607 --> 00:28:55.608
I can get money?

540
00:28:56.276 --> 00:28:58.695
Scholarship money
that goes towards your tuition

541
00:28:58.778 --> 00:29:01.781
because if you're going to
a private school or a Catholic school.

542
00:29:01.865 --> 00:29:02.907
you're paying tuition.

543
00:29:02.991 --> 00:29:03.908
Oh.

544
00:29:05.076 --> 00:29:06.703
And you can also get a full ride.

545
00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:09.330
That means you don't
pay anything to go there.

546
00:29:09.414 --> 00:29:10.832
They can offer you a full ride.

547
00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:15.044
They'll say you don't
need to pay anything to come here.

548
00:29:15.128 --> 00:29:15.962
[Tai] Really?

549
00:29:16.045 --> 00:29:18.798
But you have to
do track for all four years.

550
00:29:18.882 --> 00:29:20.300
Oh. Yeah.

551
00:29:20.383 --> 00:29:24.763
So the goal would be to find schools where
you could potentially get a full ride.

552
00:29:25.346 --> 00:29:27.599
-[Tai] Definitely.
-That also means to keep those grades up…

553
00:29:27.682 --> 00:29:28.850
[Tai] And have a good attendance?

554
00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:30.268
[whispering] You have to be in school.

555
00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:31.394
[Tai] I'll be at school.

556
00:29:31.478 --> 00:29:34.314
To tie it back to what happened.
to make it go all the way around.

557
00:29:34.397 --> 00:29:35.523
you have to be at school.

558
00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:38.234
So getting into the habit of.
"I know that my attendance matters…"

559
00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:41.112
-Hmm.
-[Miss Orapullo] Those skills start now.

560
00:29:45.658 --> 00:29:46.618
[Coach Jean] Okay. listen!

561
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.412
Does everybody know where their quads are?

562
00:29:49.496 --> 00:29:50.497
[all] Yes.

563
00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.417
[Coach Jean] It's supposed to build up
your hip flexor and your quads.

564
00:29:54.501 --> 00:29:57.212
Legs up and kick.

565
00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:00.215
Kick. I'm hearing too much noise.

566
00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:05.428
Kick and kick and kick and kick.

567
00:30:05.512 --> 00:30:07.096
Turn around other side.

568
00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:10.183
And kick and kick…

569
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:16.022
<i>Tai is bursting with all kinds of talent.</i>
<i>and not just on the track.</i>

570
00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:18.775
<i>She's super. super smart.</i>

571
00:30:18.858 --> 00:30:24.531
<i>and it's just a matter of funneling</i>
<i>all that energy in the right direction.</i>

572
00:30:25.615 --> 00:30:28.159
And kick and kick and kick.

573
00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:29.744
This is what you need.

574
00:30:31.037 --> 00:30:32.956
<i>Right now. all they want to do is run.</i>

575
00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:35.583
<i>They want to train.</i>
<i>they're really committed to it.</i>

576
00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:40.129
<i>but. you know. puberty can cause that</i>
<i>to change in a heartbeat. </i>[chuckles]

577
00:30:40.213 --> 00:30:42.340
And kick and kick.

578
00:30:42.423 --> 00:30:45.260
[upbeat song playing]

579
00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:10.159
[Tonia] My mom wasn't hands-on with me.

580
00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:13.621
I never met my. ah. biological father.

581
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.164
No.

582
00:31:16.249 --> 00:31:19.043
And I met my biological mom now.

583
00:31:20.003 --> 00:31:22.171
-I met her a couple of times.
-[Tai humming]

584
00:31:24.132 --> 00:31:25.633
[Brooke] She didn't want to take you back?

585
00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:28.052
Well. I was older when…

586
00:31:28.845 --> 00:31:29.679
[Brooke] Oh.

587
00:31:29.762 --> 00:31:31.306
I was your age when I met her.

588
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.558
[Brooke] She didn't want to take you back?

589
00:31:34.475 --> 00:31:38.229
Well. would you want to leave me if you
found out that I was not your real mom

590
00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:41.190
and you came across your real mother?

591
00:31:41.274 --> 00:31:43.026
At this point. would you want to leave me?

592
00:31:43.109 --> 00:31:44.652
-[Brooke] Oh. no.
-All right. then.

593
00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.406
[Brooke] Wait. you are my real mom.

594
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.658
[Tonia chuckles] I said "if."

595
00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:54.078
[Brooke] You would
never abandon me. Right?

596
00:31:54.162 --> 00:31:55.663
-[Tonia] No.
-[Brooke] Okay. good.

597
00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:09.302
What are you doing in bed?
Do you know what time it is?

598
00:32:11.137 --> 00:32:13.389
Why are the blankets on you?

599
00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:18.186
You put too much gel. That's why
you're making my acne grow bigger.

600
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:19.646
[chuckles] I don't put too much gel.

601
00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:21.564
-Yes. you do. I can feel it.
-No.

602
00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:24.984
I don't care.
Like. I can do those edges in my sleep.

603
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.820
It's business day. I think you could be--

604
00:32:27.904 --> 00:32:28.988
A lawyer.

605
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:33.618
No. Lawyers don't wear those colors.

606
00:32:33.701 --> 00:32:35.745
I can be…
Lawyers can wear whatever they want.

607
00:32:35.828 --> 00:32:36.704
[Rainn] Mmm.

608
00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:37.747
Well. in suit form.

609
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.291
-They choose to look professional.
-This is professional.

610
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:41.501
[Rainn] Mmm-hmm.

611
00:32:41.584 --> 00:32:43.044
That's mine.

612
00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:44.921
-No.
-Give me. Tai.

613
00:32:45.588 --> 00:32:46.631
-Give me.
-Ouch!

614
00:32:47.882 --> 00:32:48.883
Give me. Tai.

615
00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:50.885
-Before I mess up your edges.
-You never use it.

616
00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:51.803
Let me have it.

617
00:32:51.886 --> 00:32:53.846
-[Rainn] It's mine and I need it.
-[Tai] I was using it first.

618
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.057
Let me have it. We'll talk about it later.

619
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.141
Where's your hat at?

620
00:32:57.767 --> 00:32:59.936
My hair. You can't do this to me.

621
00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:02.230
Tai. you just got over a stuffy time.

622
00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:03.439
-No.
-Here.

623
00:33:07.777 --> 00:33:10.697
"Twix" kissed me on Friday.

624
00:33:11.823 --> 00:33:12.657
[friend] Who?

625
00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.492
Twix kissed me on Friday.

626
00:33:14.575 --> 00:33:16.369
-[friend] Ooh.
-Yeah. There was this whole story

627
00:33:16.452 --> 00:33:18.746
where in the staircase. his bag broke.

628
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.540
and then I was fixing it. right?

629
00:33:20.623 --> 00:33:22.709
And then he took my chin and kissed me.

630
00:33:22.792 --> 00:33:25.628
And on upstairs.
and then he kept doing it again.

631
00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:28.006
but this time was like longer.

632
00:33:28.631 --> 00:33:30.633
But we kept hearing people
so we just stopped.

633
00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:42.061
He was banned
when he refused to fight for his country.

634
00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:45.690
[imperceptible]

635
00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:49.944
[woman narrating] <i>She's changing</i>
<i>from a young girl to a young woman.</i>

636
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:53.865
<i>Puberty is a stage of life</i>
<i>everyone goes through.</i>

637
00:33:53.948 --> 00:33:56.409
<i>Hair will begin to grow</i>
<i>in your pubic area.</i>

638
00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:58.953
<i>under your arms. and on your legs.</i>

639
00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:02.790
<i>These changes are triggered by</i>
<i>chemicals in your body called hormones.</i>

640
00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:07.628
[Coach Jean] Okay. so one of the changes
that's going to happen to you very soon

641
00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:09.547
is called menstruation.

642
00:34:12.759 --> 00:34:15.803
Everybody know where
their vagina is? Point in that direction.

643
00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:16.721
[all laughing]

644
00:34:16.804 --> 00:34:18.723
-[Tonia] One would hope.
-[Coach Jean] Yeah.

645
00:34:19.432 --> 00:34:24.395
Another thing that you can use
for your period is called a tampon.

646
00:34:24.479 --> 00:34:26.147
-[Tonia] Yes. Brooke?
-Doesn't it go up?

647
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:27.857
[Coach Jean] Yes.
I'm getting ready to tell you.

648
00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:31.486
So you put it at
the bottom of your vagina. okay?

649
00:34:32.278 --> 00:34:34.822
When you're ready
to change it. you go to the bathroom.

650
00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:37.408
squat over the toilet. pull this out.

651
00:34:38.034 --> 00:34:39.786
If you are an athlete. it's easier to use.

652
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:43.039
{\an8}easier to get rid of.
and just easier to take.

653
00:34:43.122 --> 00:34:45.249
Anybody have any questions about…

654
00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:47.043
Yes. Brooke. of course.

655
00:34:47.126 --> 00:34:49.212
Don't you have three holes?

656
00:34:49.295 --> 00:34:51.964
-[Coach Jean] You have three holes. One--
-Which one do you put it in?

657
00:34:52.048 --> 00:34:53.633
[Coach Jean] You put it in the middle one.

658
00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:55.343
The only one it can go in.

659
00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:58.763
It can't go in your butthole 'cause
that's where your poo-poo comes out.

660
00:34:58.846 --> 00:35:00.056
[all laughing]

661
00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:03.267
[Coach Jean] Um. okay. So you do have
three holes down there.

662
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:04.477
One you pee out of.

663
00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:09.148
then there's a bigger hole.
and then there's your butthole.

664
00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:10.149
[kids gigglng]

665
00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:13.778
Don't put anything up in there.
That's just for things to come out.

666
00:35:14.362 --> 00:35:16.114
This is too little for things to go in.

667
00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:20.701
There's only one hole where
things can actually go up in there.

668
00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:24.205
And that's where your tampon goes.

669
00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:26.833
where the baby comes out.
where the sperm goes in.

670
00:35:26.916 --> 00:35:28.584
A lot of things go on with that hole.

671
00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:29.669
[all giggle]

672
00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.004
That's the middle hole.

673
00:35:33.256 --> 00:35:35.716
As these changes start to occur.

674
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.302
not only will boys
look at you differently.

675
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:40.388
but men will look at you differently.

676
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.102
And they'll do things
that make you uncomfortable.

677
00:35:46.185 --> 00:35:48.396
and when they do. you come to me.

678
00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:50.982
Okay? Does everybody understand that?

679
00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:51.983
Yeah.

680
00:35:52.066 --> 00:35:52.900
[Coach Jean] Okay.

681
00:35:55.486 --> 00:36:00.783
[girls] …six. seven.
eight. nine. ten. eleven…

682
00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:02.076
[Coach Jean] Hi. girls.

683
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.202
…13…

684
00:36:03.286 --> 00:36:05.621
{\an8}Hi. sweetie pie. I missed you.

685
00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:08.082
{\an8}-Me. too. I made you something from camp.
-Oh. yeah?

686
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:10.501
[Tai] I think it'll go on
your keychain. I have to find it.

687
00:36:10.585 --> 00:36:13.337
[Coach Jean] So your mother
took you for an MRI?

688
00:36:13.421 --> 00:36:15.548
-That's an X-ray. right?
-Sort of like an X-ray.

689
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:17.091
-Yeah.
-What did they say?

690
00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:19.760
{\an8}The bone right here
is separated from my knee.

691
00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.012
{\an8}-Yeah.
-Like that.

692
00:36:21.095 --> 00:36:22.471
{\an8}It's a growing thing. right?

693
00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:24.182
{\an8}'Cause I see you're taller than me now.

694
00:36:24.265 --> 00:36:25.099
Yes. I am.

695
00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:28.019
And that wasn't the way it was
at the beginning of the summer.

696
00:36:28.102 --> 00:36:28.978
I told you.

697
00:36:29.061 --> 00:36:30.897
-I hate that.
-I was gonna be taller than you.

698
00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.899
You did.
I didn't think you were gonna grow.

699
00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:35.151
-Thought you were gonna be shorty doo-wop.
-Well…

700
00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:39.030
And what did he say you have to do?
Did they give you exercises…

701
00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:40.406
-[Rainn] Yeah.
-…or are you going to PT?

702
00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:42.450
[Rainn] They gave me exercises
and I'm going to PT.

703
00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:47.288
and I feel like I'm gonna be so
out of shape when I start running again.

704
00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:49.123
Forever out of shape.

705
00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:51.667
No. not forever 'cause you're so young.

706
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.754
-But first we got to get you well again.
-Yeah.

707
00:36:54.837 --> 00:36:57.548
You're going to miss out
cross-country season. but…

708
00:36:58.424 --> 00:37:00.009
But that's… That's my…

709
00:37:00.092 --> 00:37:01.844
[Coach Jean] I know. your best season.

710
00:37:01.928 --> 00:37:05.264
but I'd rather you miss out
one cross-country season

711
00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:08.392
and run through your 20s

712
00:37:08.476 --> 00:37:11.145
-than try to keep running on it.
-Yeah.

713
00:37:11.938 --> 00:37:14.106
When you come back.
you're going to be ready.

714
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.859
Not going to put you out there
until you're ready. Don't worry.

715
00:37:16.943 --> 00:37:18.069
-Okay.
-Okay?

716
00:37:18.152 --> 00:37:19.320
Give me a hug.

717
00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:21.239
-I missed you.
-[Rainn] Missed you. too.

718
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:23.241
-Okay.
-Gonna go back out.

719
00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:25.409
Stay over here and help us
with some of the kids.

720
00:37:25.493 --> 00:37:28.079
Show them how to do
the exercises correctly.

721
00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:29.163
[Coach Karel] Yeah. this is good.

722
00:37:29.247 --> 00:37:31.165
-[Coach Jean] Keep your head down.
-[Coach Karel] Run all the way through.

723
00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:32.667
{\an8}[Coach Jean] Thank you. Keep coming.

724
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.711
{\an8}-[Coach Karel] 6:18. 6:19. 6:20.
-[Coach Jean] Good job.

725
00:37:35.795 --> 00:37:37.171
-[Coach Karel] 6:21.
-You know how to do it?

726
00:37:37.964 --> 00:37:38.798
The other one.

727
00:37:39.298 --> 00:37:41.050
This one goes up while that one goes up.

728
00:37:41.133 --> 00:37:41.968
Ready?

729
00:37:43.302 --> 00:37:44.345
Okay. like this.

730
00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:46.806
Other one.

731
00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:48.432
Now put it down.

732
00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:49.976
Now lift the other one up.

733
00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:51.686
And now jump.

734
00:37:52.645 --> 00:37:53.479
Yeah. like that.

735
00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:55.356
[Coach Karel] 6:21.

736
00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:57.525
[Rainn sighing] <i>There's a good side</i>
<i>and a bad side to it.</i>

737
00:37:57.608 --> 00:38:01.779
<i>I could focus on my schoolwork.</i>
<i>Like. only my schoolwork.</i>

738
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:06.033
<i>I'll be going to high school.</i>

739
00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:09.704
<i>and I'll have to do a lot more work</i>
<i>than I did in middle school.</i>

740
00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:11.539
<i>and it's going to be hard. I know that.</i>

741
00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:13.124
<i>But I know if I don't work hard</i>

742
00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:15.918
<i>then I'll be regretting</i>
<i>every one of my decisions.</i>

743
00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:20.965
{\an8}[woman narrating] <i>…like an amoeba.</i>
<i>relies on its cell membrane…</i>

744
00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:31.809
Joshua. I heard what Kaden asked you.

745
00:38:33.394 --> 00:38:34.312
You hear me?

746
00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:39.191
[in high-pitched helium voice] Hi. guys.
[laughing]

747
00:38:39.775 --> 00:38:41.944
Excuse me. I cannot hear Taylor.

748
00:38:42.028 --> 00:38:43.946
There's other people
that was talking. too.

749
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:47.658
Don't worry about the others.
Worry about yourself.

750
00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:50.077
-Okay.
-Worry about yourself.

751
00:38:57.752 --> 00:38:59.045
-[Tai] First of all--
-[friend] And say what?

752
00:38:59.128 --> 00:39:01.714
[Tai] We were talking about high school.
I said I was gonna miss him.

753
00:39:01.797 --> 00:39:03.257
So I hugged Lavon and Nikit.

754
00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:05.885
And 'cause I said.
"I'm gonna miss you guys."

755
00:39:05.968 --> 00:39:08.512
then he got mad.
He was like. "Oh. wow." And then--

756
00:39:08.596 --> 00:39:10.431
[friend] You could've said
you'd miss him. too.

757
00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:11.974
I did! And he was like. fake hug.

758
00:39:12.558 --> 00:39:13.642
[Tai] I need to talk to you.

759
00:39:13.726 --> 00:39:14.560
[boy] Why?

760
00:39:14.643 --> 00:39:16.645
-[Tai] Because it's important.
-[boy] What?

761
00:39:16.729 --> 00:39:17.605
[Tai] Is he mad at me?

762
00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:19.023
-[boy] Who?
-[Tai] Joshua.

763
00:39:20.399 --> 00:39:22.443
-Why isn't he talking to me?
-[boy] He don't want to.

764
00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:24.987
[Tai] What do you mean?
What do you mean he doesn't want to?

765
00:39:25.071 --> 00:39:26.697
-I don't know why he don't.
-You…

766
00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:29.658
[friend 1] You're so obsessed.

767
00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:30.826
I'm not obsessed.

768
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.827
[friend 2] Yeah.

769
00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:37.875
[friend 2] I'm gonna have to make sure
she stays far away.

770
00:39:37.958 --> 00:39:39.293
[friend 1] Give him space.

771
00:39:39.377 --> 00:39:41.087
[friend 2] Give him some space. bro.

772
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.671
He needs space from you. literally.

773
00:39:42.755 --> 00:39:44.799
[friend 1] He's going to think of you
as clingy and so annoying.

774
00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:45.966
He's gonna have…

775
00:39:52.473 --> 00:39:54.141
[girls] Rock. paper. scissors. set. shoot.

776
00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:55.601
Rock. paper. scissors. set. shoot.

777
00:39:55.684 --> 00:39:58.729
Rock. paper. scissors. set. shoot.

778
00:39:58.813 --> 00:40:00.398
Rock. paper. scissors. set. shoot.

779
00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:02.024
Rock. paper. scissors. set. shoot.

780
00:40:02.108 --> 00:40:04.193
[Coach Jean] Tai. we need
to speak to you over here.

781
00:40:06.404 --> 00:40:08.614
Do you know
what we want to speak to you about?

782
00:40:08.697 --> 00:40:09.532
Yeah.

783
00:40:09.615 --> 00:40:10.950
-[Coach Jean] Huh?
-Yes.

784
00:40:11.033 --> 00:40:12.118
[Coach Jean] About what?

785
00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:13.661
About my behavior.

786
00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:15.037
[Coach Jean] Specifically what?

787
00:40:15.121 --> 00:40:16.914
Me throwing a crayon at my teacher.

788
00:40:17.498 --> 00:40:18.499
[Coach Jean] What happened?

789
00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:20.876
[Tai] She went around the class.
embarrassing me.

790
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.212
saying that
my question was wrong. and then--

791
00:40:23.295 --> 00:40:24.547
[Coach Karel] So how
would that embarrass you

792
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.006
that you got a question wrong?

793
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.217
Because she went around the class making…

794
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.137
She went around the class
and told people that I got it wrong.

795
00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.930
and then of course Aliana
said I was stupid.

796
00:40:33.013 --> 00:40:34.932
-[Coach Karel] Okay--
-And the whole class laughed at me.

797
00:40:35.015 --> 00:40:37.435
-I know it's not comfortable.
-Then what happened?

798
00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:39.186
Then I threw a crayon at her.

799
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.856
-[Coach Karel] Okay. if I'm your teacher--
-I didn't mean--

800
00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:43.858
Don't tell me what you didn't mean.

801
00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:47.695
If I'm a teacher and I'm standing here.
how far were you from her?

802
00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.780
-A little behind the window.
-[Coach Karel] And it hit her?

803
00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:50.739
Mmm-hmm.

804
00:40:50.823 --> 00:40:52.199
-[Coach Karel] Where?
-On the knee.

805
00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:55.536
Okay. If you had thrown that crayon.

806
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.955
and it hit her in the eye.

807
00:40:58.038 --> 00:40:59.540
you wouldn't be here.

808
00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:01.876
'cause there's
a place for kids who do that.

809
00:41:02.585 --> 00:41:04.086
You have a right to get angry.

810
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.838
Everybody does.

811
00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:07.298
It's how you deal with it.

812
00:41:08.299 --> 00:41:12.553
And I know that you don't always
deal with your anger in the correct way.

813
00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:15.181
because at no point in your life

814
00:41:15.264 --> 00:41:17.099
should you ever

815
00:41:17.183 --> 00:41:19.977
attempt to assault a teacher

816
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.645
or anybody else.

817
00:41:22.521 --> 00:41:25.232
They have a school full of students

818
00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:27.902
who have assaulted an adult.

819
00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:30.613
and they got labelled.
and they got put there.

820
00:41:31.405 --> 00:41:32.781
[Coach Jean] And now you're one of them.

821
00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:36.327
Is that what you want for yourself?

822
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.871
We're so disappointed in you.

823
00:41:38.954 --> 00:41:40.956
We're so disappointed.

824
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.251
and we talked it over and we decided

825
00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:47.213
that we're going to
give you consequences here.

826
00:41:47.296 --> 00:41:50.299
even if you don't have
consequences at school.

827
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:54.386
So you're going to be
suspended from the team for a while.

828
00:41:55.095 --> 00:41:58.057
You'll be able to
come back outdoor season.

829
00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:01.060
but your indoor season is done.

830
00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:02.937
You understand?

831
00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:04.772
Huh?

832
00:42:05.439 --> 00:42:06.732
-Yes.
-[Coach Jean] Okay.

833
00:42:07.483 --> 00:42:08.734
Put your stuff on.

834
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:16.158
[crying]

835
00:42:44.144 --> 00:42:46.939
[Tai] I'm sitting here with nothing to do.

836
00:42:48.107 --> 00:42:49.858
{\an8}But you know what I do when I'm by myself?

837
00:42:52.111 --> 00:42:55.406
I love looking at nature.
and I like how the sun hits the snow.

838
00:42:56.198 --> 00:42:58.158
It glimmers sometimes.
It looks really pretty.

839
00:42:58.784 --> 00:43:00.494
Most of the time I'm just here.

840
00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:06.458
Being annoyed by my sisters
and Mom sometimes.

841
00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.628
Just never get to do anything.

842
00:43:09.712 --> 00:43:10.963
My life's simple.

843
00:43:11.046 --> 00:43:14.466
Go to school. some track.
go home. get ready for the next day.

844
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.679
And now that I have nothing to do…
I don't have a phone or anything.

845
00:43:21.515 --> 00:43:22.516
What am I gonna do?

846
00:43:23.726 --> 00:43:25.894
My life sucks right now.

847
00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:29.398
Life sucks.

848
00:43:32.026 --> 00:43:33.193
[Ms. Diann] How you feeling. Tonia?

849
00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:34.486
[Tonia] Oh. so good.

850
00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:35.946
Ah!

851
00:43:36.488 --> 00:43:39.533
Just knowing
what's about to happen. I'm feeling good.

852
00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:40.951
[both laughing]

853
00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:45.581
Three times I've been
in a relationship and lost myself in it.

854
00:43:45.664 --> 00:43:48.834
The reason
I will not do it with these girls

855
00:43:48.917 --> 00:43:52.463
is because
I know I will lose myself in it.

856
00:43:53.881 --> 00:43:54.798
I know I will.

857
00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:57.801
[Ms. Diann] Yes. you may attract
some of the same things.

858
00:43:57.885 --> 00:44:00.596
{\an8}but your tolerance level change.

859
00:44:00.679 --> 00:44:01.555
{\an8}-Not mine.
-It does.

860
00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:02.640
{\an8}Yes. it would. Tonia.

861
00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:07.686
I'm not going there
because I know that that's my weakness.

862
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:11.398
That's why I'm single.
I'm scared to tread those waters.

863
00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:14.151
When I raise these girls
and they're well on their way.

864
00:44:14.234 --> 00:44:16.487
-I'll get in a relationship.
-That's something different.

865
00:44:19.198 --> 00:44:23.410
[Tonia] I just don't want them to see me
all blushy-eyed and. like. all in love.

866
00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:24.328
I just can't.

867
00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:27.331
I've been
the strong woman forever in their life.

868
00:44:27.414 --> 00:44:30.334
And I think that when I do fall in love.

869
00:44:30.417 --> 00:44:32.753
it takes me over. you know?

870
00:44:32.836 --> 00:44:36.006
That's why I was
never probably good at it.

871
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.633
It just takes over.

872
00:44:37.716 --> 00:44:40.219
You know. I see it in them. too.

873
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:44.556
They got all my qualities
when it comes to love.

874
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.724
Oh. it's disgusting.

875
00:44:46.475 --> 00:44:50.813
So I'll wait until
they're out the house. you know.

876
00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:53.107
so I can have my moment.

877
00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:55.943
A big part of me is closed.

878
00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:59.029
I fight against that daily. you know.

879
00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:00.906
I fight it. um…

880
00:45:04.118 --> 00:45:05.327
Yeah.

881
00:45:05.411 --> 00:45:06.703
I think that. um…

882
00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:09.415
[clicks tongue]

883
00:45:09.498 --> 00:45:10.541
[sighs softly]

884
00:45:10.624 --> 00:45:12.167
I don't want to be like this.

885
00:45:12.251 --> 00:45:13.877
Life has made me like that.

886
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.588
The worst has happened.

887
00:45:19.091 --> 00:45:20.134
You know?

888
00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:21.468
I lost a child.

889
00:45:22.177 --> 00:45:23.429
The worst has happened.

890
00:45:23.512 --> 00:45:29.893
I think their road is paved in blessings.

891
00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:31.770
so I trust that.

892
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.023
They are my fresh start.

893
00:45:36.275 --> 00:45:39.528
I needed my second chance to be successful

894
00:45:40.487 --> 00:45:43.824
'cause I felt I was blessed
to be given a second chance.

895
00:45:44.783 --> 00:45:47.661
[Brooke] Mom said that when he died.
his soul went into me.

896
00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:50.747
because she said I walk like him.
I talk like him. I act like him.

897
00:45:51.832 --> 00:45:56.378
I always have to accept the fact
that he's in a better place now.

898
00:45:56.462 --> 00:45:59.089
and I have to continue with my life.

899
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:02.551
I can't always be sad.

900
00:46:03.385 --> 00:46:08.098
I have to be happy and… think of him.

901
00:46:12.227 --> 00:46:16.148
[Tonia] <i>The decision to raise</i>
<i>these three on my own</i>

902
00:46:16.231 --> 00:46:21.445
<i>came straight from my experience</i>
<i>with an abusive relationship.</i>

903
00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:26.325
<i>I got through a lot of things in my life</i>
<i>some people just don't survive.</i>

904
00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:30.287
<i>So I'm just fighting my way out. you know?</i>

905
00:46:33.081 --> 00:46:36.543
[Brooke] <i>My mom. she's gone through a lot.</i>

906
00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:39.004
<i>And she can share challenges with me</i>

907
00:46:39.087 --> 00:46:43.175
<i>and make me realize what type of world</i>
<i>I live in and how to deal with it.</i>

908
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:47.513
[Coach Karel] When does
their apartment payment stop?

909
00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:48.430
[Coach Jean] Um.

910
00:46:48.514 --> 00:46:49.640
it should be in April.

911
00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:52.434
Maybe he forgot and just keeps paying it.

912
00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:54.353
-[both laughing]
-That'd be good for her.

913
00:46:55.437 --> 00:46:57.981
-I'm sure--
-She has to learn to manage her own money.

914
00:46:58.065 --> 00:47:00.150
-[Coach Karel] That's why you need to--
-[Coach Jean] I have to speak to her.

915
00:47:00.234 --> 00:47:03.153
Yeah. Don't want her
to end up back in the shelter.

916
00:47:03.237 --> 00:47:05.822
Because that happens so fast for people.

917
00:47:05.906 --> 00:47:06.740
Yeah.

918
00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:09.493
Especially when you have three kids.

919
00:47:09.576 --> 00:47:11.578
-Three growing kids.
-Yeah.

920
00:47:12.204 --> 00:47:13.747
They need everything.

921
00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:18.752
[laughing]

922
00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:27.553
Didn't I say no roughhousing on the ice?

923
00:47:27.636 --> 00:47:28.679
You. get off.

924
00:47:29.763 --> 00:47:31.515
[shrieks and laughs]

925
00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:35.352
[Coach Jean] Did you fill out the thing
for public high schools?

926
00:47:35.435 --> 00:47:38.981
I plan to go to a specialized high school.
but I have to wait for the results.

927
00:47:39.064 --> 00:47:41.567
-When do the results come in?
-Like. March.

928
00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.528
March? I didn't know it was that long.

929
00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:45.946
Yeah. The test even said--

930
00:47:46.029 --> 00:47:47.364
You took the test already?

931
00:47:48.574 --> 00:47:50.659
-How do you think you did?
-I think I did good.

932
00:47:50.742 --> 00:47:52.077
I answered all the questions.

933
00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.037
-You did well?
-Yeah.

934
00:47:54.121 --> 00:47:55.038
Good.

935
00:47:55.914 --> 00:47:59.334
Well. we'll see. I mean. if you
get into a specialized high school.

936
00:47:59.418 --> 00:48:01.003
I would want you to go there.

937
00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:02.337
Yeah.

938
00:48:02.421 --> 00:48:04.673
If not. I would want you
to go to St. Joseph's.

939
00:48:04.756 --> 00:48:07.718
-St. Joseph's?
-It's a good school.

940
00:48:09.678 --> 00:48:11.888
Okay. guys.
this is how you do it. You take…

941
00:48:13.432 --> 00:48:16.476
-Let me just put this upright.
-[Rainn] What the hell. Tai?

942
00:48:21.481 --> 00:48:23.442
Take two hands.

943
00:48:24.943 --> 00:48:27.362
Put them near the pimple.
not on it. but near it.

944
00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:30.157
And you're going to squeeze!
[laughs hysterically]

945
00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.952
[Rainn laughing hysterically]
Tai. you're so gross.

946
00:48:36.788 --> 00:48:39.166
I'm gonna sing a song.
What song should I sing?

947
00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:42.044
<i>♪ You can never give up ♪</i>

948
00:48:42.127 --> 00:48:44.379
<i>♪ You can reach your goals ♪</i>

949
00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:47.382
<i>♪ Just talk to your soul and say ♪</i>

950
00:48:47.966 --> 00:48:51.386
<i>♪ I will. I will ♪</i>

951
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:54.598
<i>♪ I know my dreams are real ♪</i>

952
00:48:57.059 --> 00:49:02.064
<i>It's hard to run because you</i>
<i>have to meet people's expectations.</i>

953
00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:05.025
{\an8}<i>Even if you're injured.</i>
<i>you have to run really fast</i>

954
00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:06.026
{\an8}<i>because if you don't</i>

955
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:10.155
{\an8}<i>then everyone looks like</i>
<i>they're not proud of you or something.</i>

956
00:49:10.822 --> 00:49:13.450
<i>Sometimes any sport</i>
<i>is too much pressure for people.</i>

957
00:49:13.533 --> 00:49:15.035
<i>so they just don't do sports.</i>

958
00:49:16.411 --> 00:49:18.330
<i>I like the adrenaline.</i>
<i>but not the pressure.</i>

959
00:49:21.917 --> 00:49:23.001
[Dr. Goldstein] All righty.

960
00:49:23.585 --> 00:49:25.212
How much pain you got today?

961
00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:26.129
None.

962
00:49:26.213 --> 00:49:27.714
-You have none?
-Hmm?

963
00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:29.424
-No pain?
-No.

964
00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.343
-Knees good?
-Yeah.

965
00:49:33.595 --> 00:49:38.392
Straight. Straight. Straight.
Up. up. up. Beautiful.

966
00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:43.313
[Rainn] She's. um. a sprinter?

967
00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:45.357
[Dr. Goldstein] Yes.
She's got five gold medals.

968
00:49:45.941 --> 00:49:48.235
Diane Dixon. All gold.

969
00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:50.946
-Really?
-Yep.

970
00:49:51.029 --> 00:49:52.072
Ooh!

971
00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:54.950
-[Dr. Goldstein] That's right.
-[Rainn] Wow.

972
00:49:55.701 --> 00:50:00.414
[Coach Jean] 1975 was the first year for
the Colgate Women's Games.

973
00:50:01.206 --> 00:50:03.750
And the reason
that the Colgate Games started

974
00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:05.711
is because back in the '70s.

975
00:50:05.794 --> 00:50:08.672
there wasn't
a lot of opportunity for female athletes.

976
00:50:08.755 --> 00:50:10.465
The boys had everything.

977
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:15.220
What's the big thing about Colgate?
Why do we push you so hard? Adelia?

978
00:50:15.303 --> 00:50:17.264
[Adelia] Because the winner
gets scholarship money.

979
00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:20.058
You get scholarship money for school.

980
00:50:20.142 --> 00:50:22.060
How many of you going to college?

981
00:50:22.644 --> 00:50:23.812
Absolutely.

982
00:50:23.895 --> 00:50:28.233
And even though
a full scholarship will go far.

983
00:50:28.316 --> 00:50:30.485
you're still going to need incidentals.

984
00:50:30.569 --> 00:50:33.947
Like. "Oh. wow.
they're paying my room and board."

985
00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.449
"I might have to buy books."

986
00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:38.910
So that Colgate money
could be used toward your books.

987
00:50:38.994 --> 00:50:41.663
and then you have extra money. Okay?

988
00:50:41.747 --> 00:50:44.583
I received Colgate money for ten years.

989
00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:46.835
The ten years I ran the Colgate Games.

990
00:50:46.918 --> 00:50:49.921
All right? So. this weekend.

991
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.467
remember. do the best you can.

992
00:50:54.509 --> 00:50:57.304
-No punks out there. Understand?
-[all] Yes.

993
00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:58.221
Have a good night.

994
00:51:03.018 --> 00:51:05.729
{\an8}[Coach Jean]<i> My coach. Fred Thompson.</i>

995
00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:08.523
<i>he started the Colgate Women's Games.</i>

996
00:51:09.649 --> 00:51:14.571
<i>It was his idea. really.</i>
<i>to put women in the forefront</i>

997
00:51:14.654 --> 00:51:16.239
<i>of track and field.</i>

998
00:51:16.323 --> 00:51:19.284
<i>He was a pioneer in that respect.</i>

999
00:51:20.952 --> 00:51:25.332
<i>He wanted women</i>
<i>to get the opportunity to go to college</i>

1000
00:51:25.415 --> 00:51:27.459
<i>and through track and field he did that.</i>

1001
00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:29.252
One. two. three.

1002
00:51:29.336 --> 00:51:30.337
[all] Jeuness!

1003
00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.547
Oh. my God. That never gets old.

1004
00:51:33.799 --> 00:51:35.884
For me. he was a mentor.

1005
00:51:35.967 --> 00:51:38.887
Before I met him.
I didn't know any Black people

1006
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.765
who were attorneys
who had gone to law school.

1007
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:45.685
So I got that in my head that
that's what I wanted to do.

1008
00:51:47.854 --> 00:51:49.815
I've been a coach for 33 years.

1009
00:51:49.898 --> 00:51:53.360
{\an8}But as a career.
I'm an administrative law judge.

1010
00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:55.070
{\an8}I don't get paid for coaching.

1011
00:51:56.571 --> 00:52:00.075
My mother told us
that we should get an education.

1012
00:52:00.158 --> 00:52:02.410
We should become something.

1013
00:52:03.036 --> 00:52:05.038
Not exactly knowing how.

1014
00:52:05.956 --> 00:52:10.126
but at that time. the city universities
in New York were free.

1015
00:52:10.836 --> 00:52:13.255
So I chose to go to law school.

1016
00:52:14.256 --> 00:52:16.591
And even my father discouraged me

1017
00:52:17.259 --> 00:52:21.429
because those were opportunities
that were never open to him.

1018
00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:26.685
but I just kept going
with what I wanted to do.

1019
00:52:26.768 --> 00:52:29.145
and eventually. he was so proud of me.

1020
00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:33.108
So that's what I want for the girls also.

1021
00:52:33.733 --> 00:52:35.277
Those opportunities.

1022
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.363
[announcer]<i> Lane one. Juliette Salazar.</i>

[spectators cheering]

1027
00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.231
[Coach Jean] Just relax.

1028
00:53:15.734 --> 00:53:16.860
Don't rush!

1029
00:53:19.571 --> 00:53:21.698
Her head's gone down to remain stable.

1030
00:53:27.537 --> 00:53:29.080
Rainn's ready to race.

1031
00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.250
Yeah. she's ready to race.

1032
00:53:35.337 --> 00:53:36.338
She's gonna have to run.

1033
00:53:36.922 --> 00:53:39.174
-[woman] Don't wait.
-[Coach Jean] Don't wait.

1034
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.889
She's got to start running now.

1035
00:53:45.972 --> 00:53:47.265
[Coach Karel] Running right now.

1036
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:51.561
You got to take
a deep breath and go. Rainn.

1037
00:53:51.645 --> 00:53:54.606
[Coach Karel] Go. Rainn. Don't wait.

1038
00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:57.525
Don't wait. Don't wait.

1039
00:53:58.693 --> 00:54:00.487
[Coach Jean] She's
gotta be going from there.

1040
00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.113
[Coach Karel] Rainn's stride opened.

1041
00:54:02.197 --> 00:54:04.407
{\an8}-[Coach Jean] Yeah.
-[Coach Karel] That's the way to go.

1042
00:54:05.408 --> 00:54:06.534
{\an8}[Coach Jean] Dig!

1043
00:54:07.702 --> 00:54:08.620
{\an8}Dig!

1044
00:54:10.163 --> 00:54:13.792
{\an8}Yeah. she's right there. 4:57.

1045
00:54:13.875 --> 00:54:14.709

1046
00:54:20.548 --> 00:54:21.591
[chuckles]

1047
00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:23.843
[spectators cheering]

1048
00:54:28.431 --> 00:54:30.392
[Coach Jean] Gonna need that money later.

1049
00:54:30.475 --> 00:54:33.061
To support your coach. [chuckles]

1050
00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.774
[Coach Jean] Good. Tai. Yeah.

1051
00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:41.569
Gonna be people out
there sprinting on you.

1052
00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:44.364
Quicker. quicker. quicker.

1053
00:54:45.031 --> 00:54:46.116
Good.

1054
00:54:46.199 --> 00:54:50.036
<i>Rainn came back from an injury</i>
<i>and she's doing very well.</i>

1055
00:54:51.579 --> 00:54:57.836
<i>There's going to be a lot of coaches</i>
<i>looking for them to come to their school.</i>

1056
00:54:58.837 --> 00:55:03.717
<i>Well. I want them to go to</i>
<i>the best school for them academically.</i>

1057
00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.093
[panting]

1058
00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:08.263
[Rainn]<i> I want to be great.</i>
<i>I want to be known.</i>

1059
00:55:08.346 --> 00:55:13.226
<i>So when I die. I want people to know</i>
<i>who Rainn Sheppard was.</i>

1060
00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:18.231
<i>We're the first generation. The OGs. man.</i>

1061
00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:20.191
<i>The Sheppards are the OGs.</i>

1062
00:55:24.195 --> 00:55:25.238
[indistinct chatter]

1063
00:55:27.699 --> 00:55:30.785
Have they gotten back to you
from the Tyler Perry Foundation?

1064
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:34.748
-About your rent or anything?
-Oh. No.

1065
00:55:35.457 --> 00:55:37.292
No? They haven't said anything?

1066
00:55:37.375 --> 00:55:40.045
Maybe they'll just continue that
for the rest of your life. [chuckles]

1067
00:55:40.128 --> 00:55:42.297
Yeah. Maybe he'll just forget about it--

1068
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.548
Let's hope so

1069
00:55:43.631 --> 00:55:46.217
because you think
you'll be able to handle the rent?

1070
00:55:46.301 --> 00:55:47.177
After?

1071
00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.303
[Coach Jean] After. yeah.

1072
00:55:48.386 --> 00:55:49.220
[hesitating]

1073
00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:53.892
I can do it.
I just got to keep saying no to the girls.

1074
00:55:53.975 --> 00:55:56.603
[Coach Jean] Yeah.
Or call me and I'll say no.

1075
00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:58.188
[both laughing]

1076
00:55:58.938 --> 00:56:00.273
That's basically it.

1077
00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:02.901
[Coach Jean] Yeah. say.
"Okay. wait. you want so-and-so?"

1078
00:56:02.984 --> 00:56:04.235
"Wait. just let me ask Jean."

1079
00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:07.030
You're not the only one
raising these girls. [chuckles]

1080
00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:13.995
Every year we go to what's called
the AAU Junior Olympic Nationals.

1081
00:56:14.079 --> 00:56:17.874
If you're looking on this list and
you know your daughter has run this time.

1082
00:56:17.957 --> 00:56:20.752
there's a good chance that she's going.

1083
00:56:20.835 --> 00:56:22.504
College coaches go to the Nationals

1084
00:56:22.587 --> 00:56:28.134
and say this girl came in third or fourth
or fifth in the finals at the Nationals.

1085
00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:29.385
That's excellent.

1086
00:56:29.469 --> 00:56:33.098
They give medals
to the top eight in each event.

1087
00:56:33.181 --> 00:56:36.392
Now that seems generous.

1088
00:56:36.476 --> 00:56:41.689
but when you have 200 people
in the nine-year-old 200-meter dash.

1089
00:56:41.773 --> 00:56:44.943
to come in the top eight is no easy feat.

1090
00:56:45.026 --> 00:56:47.570
That means that
you're in the top eight in the country.

1091
00:56:48.696 --> 00:56:50.573
Come on. Adelia. stick to the line!

1092
00:56:52.158 --> 00:56:54.953
[loudly] Dig! You know what dig means?

1093
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:56.788
Shauna!

1094
00:56:56.871 --> 00:57:01.876
You ever tell somebody to slow down in
my practice again. and you won't be back.

1095
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.587
Do you understand? Are you crazy?

1096
00:57:05.171 --> 00:57:06.714
Ready? Goodbye.

1097
00:57:11.094 --> 00:57:14.097
Take your hands out of your pocket.

1098
00:57:17.142 --> 00:57:20.937
Good. From the beginning. Shauna. Good.

1099
00:57:22.355 --> 00:57:25.567
If you stop. go home. and don't come back.

1100
00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:26.609
Thank you.

1101
00:57:27.485 --> 00:57:30.238
So did you hear from any schools yet?

1102
00:57:30.321 --> 00:57:31.364
The public schools?

1103
00:57:31.448 --> 00:57:34.284
{\an8}Uh. I heard from Bedford Academy.
That's it.

1104
00:57:34.367 --> 00:57:36.119
-Bedford Academy. that's all?
-Yeah.

1105
00:57:36.202 --> 00:57:38.830
What specialized
high schools did you put down?

1106
00:57:39.414 --> 00:57:42.083
Brooklyn Tech.
Brooklyn Latin and Stuyvesant.

1107
00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:44.752
[Coach Jean] Well. Stuyvesant.
the results are out.

1108
00:57:44.836 --> 00:57:46.254
That's means I didn't make it.

1109
00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:48.131
[Coach Jean] That's what Mitsy said.

1110
00:57:48.214 --> 00:57:51.885
She said that only
seven Black kids got into Stuyvesant.

1111
00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:52.844
What?

1112
00:57:53.428 --> 00:57:57.557
Three hundred and ninety-five
were accepted. only seven Black kids.

1113
00:57:58.558 --> 00:58:01.811
So. cross Stuyvesant off your list.

1114
00:58:02.645 --> 00:58:03.897
I didn't want that anyway.

1115
00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:06.733
[Coach Jean] Do you think that
going to a regular public high school

1116
00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:09.527
would be better
than going to St. Joseph's.

1117
00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:11.571
which is a private school?

1118
00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:13.781
-Well. by comparison. no.
-[Coach Jean] You don't know?

1119
00:58:13.865 --> 00:58:15.200
-No?
-Like. but--

1120
00:58:15.283 --> 00:58:17.577
There are some
good public schools. of course.

1121
00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:21.122
but I just think that
St. Joseph's is a better bet for you.

1122
00:58:21.873 --> 00:58:23.291
So we'll just wait and see.

1123
00:58:23.374 --> 00:58:26.002
I know you're going to
do well wherever you go.

1124
00:58:27.879 --> 00:58:31.382
{\an8}-[Rainn] Or the Japanese. Or the Koreans.
-[Tai] Japanese.

1125
00:58:31.466 --> 00:58:33.510
{\an8}[chattering indistinctly]

1126
00:58:33.593 --> 00:58:36.429
{\an8}[woman] What are you looking for
in a high school? What's your number one?

1127
00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:40.058
Even if that's the food.
the basketball. whatever it is.

1128
00:58:40.141 --> 00:58:41.100
What's your number one?

1129
00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:43.561
-[girl] The food.
-Food. Okay. Sports.

1130
00:58:43.645 --> 00:58:45.104
I'm impressed with your grades.

1131
00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:48.983
You guys are like 90s or better students.
so if you want to come to this school.

1132
00:58:49.067 --> 00:58:51.402
just come have a conversation
with me or the principal.

1133
00:58:51.486 --> 00:58:52.737
and we'll figure something out.

1134
00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.406
That's how usually
our application process works.

1135
00:58:58.284 --> 00:58:59.869
So. what do you guys talk about?

1136
00:58:59.953 --> 00:59:01.287
Like. the election.

1137
00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:03.122
We did a whole worksheet on the election.

1138
00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:04.666
I still don't know how it works.

1139
00:59:04.749 --> 00:59:07.460
How come you went from
the French to the Industrial Revolution?

1140
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:09.546
The Industrial Revolution
is about south and north.

1141
00:59:09.629 --> 00:59:11.381
-You get to bring the iPads home?
-Yeah.

1142
00:59:11.881 --> 00:59:13.174
Okay. so we have to…

1143
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:19.097
We sit next to each other.
so all of us are gonna be together.

1144
00:59:26.646 --> 00:59:28.439
[Tai] I don't want to go
to an all-girls school.

1145
00:59:29.357 --> 00:59:32.485
Girls. they're just so dramatic.

1146
00:59:33.361 --> 00:59:36.990
but boys. sometimes you can
just get along really swell.

1147
00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:39.367
But sometimes
they're just rude and annoying.

1148
00:59:39.867 --> 00:59:41.452
I guess it's just based on the people.

1149
00:59:41.536 --> 00:59:44.289
That's why I don't want to
go to an all-girls school.

1150
00:59:44.956 --> 00:59:46.249
But I don't mind St. Joseph's.

1151
00:59:46.332 --> 00:59:48.459
St. Joseph's would be
a good all-girls school.

1152
00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:51.212
I want school to have a lot of activities.

1153
00:59:51.296 --> 00:59:53.256
so I can have options.

1154
00:59:53.339 --> 00:59:58.136
I want to be able
to find a hobby or. like. find something

1155
00:59:58.219 --> 01:00:01.347
that I would love to do when I
leave high school to go to college.

1156
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:04.309
so I can already have
an idea because I don't want to…

1157
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.812
I don't want to go to college
and not know what to do.

1158
01:00:07.895 --> 01:00:09.772
spend extra years trying to find out

1159
01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:14.861
'cause I want to just have my
four years in college and then leave.

1160
01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:19.073
and then go for
my career or be an Olympian.

1161
01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:20.366
[humming]

1162
01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:34.756
Look at this beautiful face.
That's worldwide handsome.

1163
01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:39.844
Listen. did your mother tell you that
you both got accepted to St. Joseph's?

1164
01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:41.012
Yeah.

1165
01:00:41.095 --> 01:00:42.972
And you got full scholarships.

1166
01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:44.807
-What?
-Yes!

1167
01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.893
-We both got full--
-For the full four years?

1168
01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:49.729
Yes. based on your excellent grades.

1169
01:00:50.688 --> 01:00:52.106
This is that quote.

1170
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:54.609
"When the door opens
and lets your future in."

1171
01:00:54.692 --> 01:00:56.277
This is that door opening

1172
01:00:56.361 --> 01:01:00.948
because the next three years
will determine where you go to college.

1173
01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:04.410
They only look at your
freshman. sophomore and junior grade.

1174
01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:08.081
Because if we do really good
freshman. sophomore and junior year.

1175
01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:10.750
then we won't have to
pay for college either.

1176
01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:13.378
No. you won't have to pay for college.

1177
01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:15.505
-Full ride. we're looking for.
-[Rainn squealing]

1178
01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:18.424
-[Tai] I know I want to go--
-To a great school.

1179
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.802
-[Tai] I'm scared.
-You're scared?

1180
01:01:21.803 --> 01:01:23.179
You'll be three years older.

1181
01:01:23.262 --> 01:01:25.723
You won't be scared.
You'll be ready to go.

1182
01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:30.645
You wanna get out of Brooklyn
and go someplace beautiful and nice?

1183
01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:33.147
-You can live with me five more years.
-Definitely not.

1184
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:34.649
We have to have a big house.

1185
01:01:34.732 --> 01:01:36.109
[inaudible conversation]

1186
01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.573
[shushing softly]

1187
01:01:57.171 --> 01:01:59.382
I would like to record our sisters.

1188
01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:01.426
Why are you here today?

1189
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:03.845
To celebrate Tai's birthday with her.

1190
01:02:03.928 --> 01:02:05.555
[Rainn] What is Tai to you?

1191
01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:07.014
-My best friend.
-[Rainn] Oh.

1192
01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:10.017
{\an8}-Tai your only friend in our family?
-No.

1193
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.477
{\an8}[Rainn] Who else are your friends?

1194
01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:15.314
[chuckles] Rainn and Brooke.

1195
01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.692
What do you like
about the Sheppard family?

1196
01:02:18.609 --> 01:02:19.652
Everything?

1197
01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:20.570
[Rainn] Like?

1198
01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:25.408
They're nice. Very caring. compassionate.

1199
01:02:25.491 --> 01:02:27.243
[Rainn] What high school are you going to?

1200
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.871
-St. Joseph.
-[Rainn] Good job.

1201
01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:30.872
Thank you.

1202
01:02:30.955 --> 01:02:33.875
[Sariani] So you got a full scholarship.
like. the full four years?

1203
01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:36.461
-Yeah.
-[Sariani] Hmm. must be nice.

1204
01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:38.337
Rainn.

1205
01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:44.761
{\an8}I know she's happy for me.
but you could show it a little more.

1206
01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:48.014
That's okay. No.
You can't change it. Sariani. No.

1207
01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:48.973
[Sariani] Okay.

1208
01:02:49.807 --> 01:02:53.144
[all] <i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1209
01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:57.815
<i>♪ Happy birthday. dear Tai Tai ♪</i>

1210
01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:01.819
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1211
01:03:03.821 --> 01:03:06.741
[Coach Jean] Now on page 11. she said.

1212
01:03:06.824 --> 01:03:09.535
"At Williamson.
I don't have to play it cool."

1213
01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:14.081
"I'm cool by default because
I'm one of the only Black kids there."

1214
01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:19.086
{\an8}"That means flipping the switch
in my brain so I'm Williamson Starr."

1215
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.422
"Williamson Starr doesn't use slang."

1216
01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:24.383
If a rapper would say it.
she doesn't say it.

1217
01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.052
even if her white friends do.

1218
01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:29.138
"Slang makes them cool."
But slang makes her what?

1219
01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:31.182
-[all] Hood.
-[Coach Jean] Hood. Yes.

1220
01:03:31.265 --> 01:03:35.728
Basically. William Starr doesn't give
anyone a reason to call her ghetto.

1221
01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:39.273
"I can't stand myself
for doing it. but I do it anyway."

1222
01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:41.567
Why you think she does it anyway?

1223
01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:44.779
If I put you in
an all-white school right now…

1224
01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:47.156
[all chuckling]

1225
01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:51.244
If you said.
"Brooke. you dragging it. Brooke."

1226
01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:56.207
You think your white friends
would understand that? [chuckles]

1227
01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:57.834
"I'm weak."

1228
01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.585
[all chuckle]

1229
01:04:00.419 --> 01:04:02.880
[Coach Jean] Do you think they would know
what you were talking about?

1230
01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:04.507
-No.
-[Coach Jean chuckles] No.

1231
01:04:05.132 --> 01:04:06.425
Rainn. what about you?

1232
01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:09.554
If you were in an all-white school.
would you act the same way?

1233
01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:11.305
-Would you talk the same way?
-Yes.

1234
01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:13.891
I would still act myself and not. like…

1235
01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.434
Oh… [muttering]

1236
01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.061
[Coach Jean chuckles]

1237
01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:21.190
Okay. What happens
at the end of this chapter? Maya?

1238
01:04:21.732 --> 01:04:23.860
Khalil gets shot by the cops.

1239
01:04:23.943 --> 01:04:25.403
[Coach Jean] And how does that happen?

1240
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:28.698
-The cops pull him over.
-[Coach Jean] Pulled him over.

1241
01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:31.367
And what does Khalil do?

1242
01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:33.369
-[Brooke] He moves and they shot him.
-Yeah.

1243
01:04:33.452 --> 01:04:35.162
[Maya] And why'd they
shoot him three times?

1244
01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:38.958
[Coach Jean] 'Cause they think
Black males are. um…

1245
01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:39.959
What do you think. Missy?

1246
01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:41.002
[Tai] A danger.

1247
01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:44.547
[Coach Jean] Yeah.
like a lot of people tell me.

1248
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:46.465
because you know I have two sons.

1249
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:50.428
and they say. "Oh. you don't
have to worry because they're smart."

1250
01:04:50.511 --> 01:04:52.471
"They went to college." Is that true?

1251
01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:54.265
-[all] No.
-No.

1252
01:04:54.348 --> 01:04:59.228
Because do they stop and ask.
"Do you have a college degree?"

1253
01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:03.107
No. they're like.
"Black kids are so this and so that."

1254
01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:08.195
but if you put them in a certain place.
and you treat them a certain way.

1255
01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:11.699
that's all they know. this thug life.

1256
01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:14.952
You got to live it
to survive where you live.

1257
01:05:16.037 --> 01:05:19.165
Or you can run track. One or the other.

1258
01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:22.501
[indistinct chatter]

1259
01:05:25.796 --> 01:05:28.215
{\an8}So now it is confirmed
St. Joe's is closing.

1260
01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:32.970
I don't think that Bedford
is even an option at this point

1261
01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:37.058
because the public schools
have already accepted their offers.

1262
01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:38.559
So.

1263
01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:43.856
I told Mom whatever help you need
in finding a new school. let's do it.

1264
01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.526
but I don't want you to get your
hopes up about Bedford Academy.

1265
01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.070
Okay.

1266
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:53.741
[Miss Orapullo] You look sad.

1267
01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:55.493
Mmm-hmm.

1268
01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:59.080
[Miss Orapullo] I think you should go
and check out Bishop Loughlin.

1269
01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:01.374
It's a really great school.

1270
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:03.334
Okay.

1271
01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:16.514
[Coach Jean] I wish you wouldn't worry
about school. It's nothing to worry about.

1272
01:06:16.597 --> 01:06:18.557
All right? I got you. all right?

1273
01:06:19.183 --> 01:06:20.351
-Hmm?
-[Tai] Mmm-hmm.

1274
01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:23.521
[Coach Karel] You take on too much
for a little girl. so stop.

1275
01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.691
Come on. Get up and do what you got to do.

1276
01:06:28.567 --> 01:06:30.152
-Can you get me up?
-[Coach Jean] Help her up.

1277
01:06:30.903 --> 01:06:33.239
[Coah Karel grunts] You think
I'm playing? [chuckles]

1278
01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:34.532
Yeah. go do your drills.

1279
01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:39.286
[Coach Jean] She worries a lot.
but that's just her personality.

1280
01:06:40.037 --> 01:06:41.914
Things always work out for the best.

1281
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:46.252
We're just waiting to hear from Loughlin

1282
01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:50.548
to see if they can squeeze them into
the freshman class. [chuckling]

1283
01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:54.093
All the way through. Good.

1284
01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:59.598
I mean. Loughlin is a good school
and it's an excellent track school.

1285
01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:03.894
and they'll have a lot of opportunities
there to run good times.

1286
01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:06.772
So they'll survive and they'll be okay.

1287
01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:11.861
Darn it. if I have to get
a second job to pay that tuition.

1288
01:07:11.944 --> 01:07:13.070
that's what I'll do.

1289
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:18.117
It's not completely out of the question.

1290
01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:20.411
[shakily] We'll see.

1291
01:07:21.787 --> 01:07:23.080
I pray a lot.

1292
01:07:23.581 --> 01:07:24.707
[interviewer] It's not free?

1293
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.668
Not free. No…

1294
01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:31.255
It's a private school. A Catholic school.

1295
01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:32.882
It's not free.

1296
01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:43.476
If you want to go to the Nationals.
you got to believe in it today.

1297
01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.728
That means you have to run your best times

1298
01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:47.521
and jump your best jumps

1299
01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:50.691
and do whatever you got to do to get in.

1300
01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:55.196
I don't care if you're in the 100 or
the 3.000 on the last straightaway.

1301
01:07:55.279 --> 01:07:56.781
How's your face gonna look?

1302
01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:03.829
God. give my girls strength and speed
and let them run what they can really run.

1303
01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:06.624
-One. two. three.
-[all] Jeuness!

1304
01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:08.542
[Coach Jean] Yeah. well… [chuckles]

1305
01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:16.258
{\an8}[announcer] On your mark.

1306
01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:18.803
[starting shot fires]

1307
01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.596
[spectators shouting and cheering]

1308
01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:22.098
Brookie!

1309
01:08:22.181 --> 01:08:24.183
[Rainn] Come on. Brooke!

1310
01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.602
{\an8}[Coach Jean] That's it. Brookie!

1311
01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.354
{\an8}Come on. Brookie!

1312
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.526
{\an8}Brooke has run much better.

1313
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:41.951
[interviewer] Are you nervous now?

1314
01:08:43.702 --> 01:08:45.329
Do you want to go to the Nationals?

1315
01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:48.666
I guess.

1316
01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:53.921
[Coach Jean] You know.
she's got the teenage blues.

1317
01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:01.846
[announcer] On your mark.

1318
01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.056
Set…

1319
01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:06.016
[starting shot fires]

1320
01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.810
[spectators shouting and cheering]

1321
01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.732
[Coach Jean] Run a good stretch!

1322
01:09:14.608 --> 01:09:15.776
She can run.

1323
01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:19.780
She's not going to
let it go just like that.

1324
01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:22.616
[loudly] Come on!

1325
01:09:24.869 --> 01:09:26.162
Come on!

1326
01:09:28.539 --> 01:09:31.167
Come on. you can't wait till the last lap!

1327
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:32.626
-You can't wait!
-[Coach Jean] Come on. girl.

1328
01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:34.003
{\an8}You can do it. Good!

1329
01:09:34.086 --> 01:09:35.212
{\an8}[Coach Karel] Get 'em. Tai!

1330
01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:38.591
{\an8}[Coach Jean] Come on!

1331
01:09:40.634 --> 01:09:41.927
[Coach Karel] Go get 'em. Tai!

1332
01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:44.972
Do you know
who's gonna come off that relay?

1333
01:09:45.639 --> 01:09:47.141
{\an8}[Coach Jean] Tai's gonna come off.

1334
01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:50.895
{\an8}She can't run like that
at the Nationals. Get eaten up.

1335
01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:51.812
{\an8}[Coach Karel] Mmm-mmm.

1336
01:09:52.396 --> 01:09:53.606
{\an8}[Coach Jean] Come on!

1337
01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:57.401
{\an8}She's probably
going to get booted from that relay.

1338
01:09:57.484 --> 01:10:00.279
{\an8}and Rainn will
take her place at the Nationals.

1339
01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:04.700
{\an8}That was bad.

1340
01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:07.786
{\an8}You're down as an alternate now

1341
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:11.290
because you know
that won't fly at the Nationals.

1342
01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:14.084
So we still got time.
You're still in the running.

1343
01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:19.423
Running is what saves them.

1344
01:10:19.506 --> 01:10:22.801
Running is what keeps them focused.

1345
01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:27.890
and keeps them listening.
and keeps them with a goal. you know?

1346
01:10:28.849 --> 01:10:33.896
Everybody needs a goal.
especially teenage girls. [chuckles]

1347
01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:39.610
[Tai]<i> I'm not a regular kid.</i>

1348
01:10:40.527 --> 01:10:43.572
<i>I actually have</i>
<i>big opportunities that I could take.</i>

1349
01:10:44.865 --> 01:10:47.243
[sighs]<i> And I don't really</i>
<i>want to take them.</i>

1350
01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:51.622
{\an8}<i>I like track. I really do.</i>

1351
01:10:53.707 --> 01:10:57.503
<i>But I didn't want to run track</i>
<i>with this lots of pressure.</i>

1352
01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:03.384
<i>But I have a chance to get a full ride</i>
<i>for college if I continue track.</i>

1353
01:11:10.182 --> 01:11:13.018
[Coach Jean]<i> Tai and I</i>
<i>have a good relationship.</i>

1354
01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:16.730
<i>She's been begging me for several months</i>

1355
01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:20.276
{\an8}<i>to allow her</i>
<i>to stay at the house and train…</i>

1356
01:11:21.568 --> 01:11:23.696
{\an8}<i>and it gives their parents a break.</i>

1357
01:11:24.738 --> 01:11:27.157
<i>Everybody needs</i>
<i>a break from a teenage girl.</i>

1358
01:11:28.409 --> 01:11:31.328
<i>Yes. Tai. especially.</i>

1359
01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.915
That's not standing. That's laying.

1360
01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:37.793
Stand up. Come on. Let me see.

1361
01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:40.129
<i>She's got a lot of personality.</i>

1362
01:11:40.212 --> 01:11:42.965
<i>It can't be contained</i>
<i>in a small apartment.</i>

1363
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.510
[Tai]<i> I really love Coach Jean.</i>

1364
01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:50.055
<i>She raised me in a different way</i>
<i>than my mom could.</i>

1365
01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:53.350
<i>How can I explain it? She just…</i>

1366
01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:54.977
<i>She makes me feel special.</i>

1367
01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:57.896
<i>She taught me…</i>

1368
01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:03.068
<i>even the little obstacles</i>
<i>can affect your future.</i>

1369
01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:07.489
<i>I want this experience to mean something.</i>

1370
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.492
<i>so I can prove that</i>
<i>all this was not for nothing.</i>

1371
01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:15.622
<i>I'm capable</i>
<i>of running really. really fast times.</i>

1372
01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:27.009
[Coach Jean]<i> When I was growing up.</i>
<i>my grandmother took in foster children.</i>

1373
01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:31.930
<i>There were always children</i>
<i>in her home that she raised.</i>

1374
01:12:32.556 --> 01:12:36.393
<i>and that's what we were used to.</i>
<i>you take care of children.</i>

1375
01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:38.187
<i>That was ingrained in us.</i>

1376
01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:43.776
<i>So. in some small way.</i>
<i>I try to do that through the track team.</i>

1377
01:12:44.568 --> 01:12:46.695
<i>Take care of kids who have parents.</i>

1378
01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:51.408
<i>but they need</i>
<i>some extra person in their lives.</i>

1379
01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:55.537
<i>I've lost some</i>
<i>really talented girls to the street.</i>

1380
01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.748
<i>and it's always sad for me.</i>

1381
01:12:57.831 --> 01:13:01.460
<i>but I finally had to say to myself.</i>

1382
01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:05.589
<i>any one girl</i>
<i>that I am able to help is a victory.</i>

1383
01:13:11.428 --> 01:13:13.389
{\an8}Stay here and do your drills.

1384
01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:17.059
Stay loose.
but you know where it's all at. right?

1385
01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:19.770
-In here?
-Right there. Yeah.

1386
01:13:19.853 --> 01:13:20.813
Still nervous.

1387
01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.690
Don't even focus on the first quarter.

1388
01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:25.818
'cause you know how you go out all hard?

1389
01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:28.362
You gotta go fast. but relax.

1390
01:13:28.445 --> 01:13:29.988
Focus on the backstretch.

1391
01:13:30.614 --> 01:13:34.576
Did you ever see the Nike commercial
where she says. "I can do this"?

1392
01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.702
Yeah.

1393
01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:37.746
That's what you
got to be singing to yourself.

1394
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:41.500
Just say. "I can do this."
and I'll be there screaming. Okay?

1395
01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:44.628
Just keep thinking. What you gonna think?

1396
01:13:44.711 --> 01:13:47.506
-I can do this.
-"I can do this." 'cause you can. You can.

1397
01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:49.967
-You believe it? You gotta believe it.
-Mmm-hmm.

1398
01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:53.595
Don't matter if I believe it 'cause
I'm not gonna be out there catching wig.

1399
01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.139
Do all the drills you can.

1400
01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:56.974
-Okay?
-Thanks. Jeannie.

1401
01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:58.058
You're welcome.

1402
01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:08.610
[woman] Thirteen. fourteen. 800.
Good luck to all of you.

1403
01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:11.196
Walk down in a straight line.
Follow number two.

1404
01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:15.617

1405
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.746

[Coach Jean] This is good! You can do it!

1408
01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:36.972
[Coach Karel] Let's go. girl!

1409

1411
01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:47.107
Hard!

1412
01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:00.704
Okay.

1413
01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:03.916
Yeah. she's won her third and final race.

1414
01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:07.169
[chuckles]

1415
01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:14.009
[Ms. Diann] I wish I could
see you tomorrow.

1416
01:15:14.092 --> 01:15:15.427
[Tai] I'll take lots of pictures.

1417
01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:17.095
[Ms. Diann] You need stuff?

1418
01:15:17.721 --> 01:15:18.680
[Tai] Like earrings?

1419
01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:19.598
[Ms. Diann] Yeah. jewelry.

1420
01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:23.060
We don't really have earrings
because we always lose them.

1421
01:15:23.143 --> 01:15:25.270
[Ms. Diann] It's prom.
You gotta get dressed a little bit.

1422
01:15:26.146 --> 01:15:27.314
This is a special moment.

1423
01:15:27.397 --> 01:15:30.776
Not everyone gets to go
because not everybody's graduating.

1424
01:15:31.276 --> 01:15:32.486
I didn't have a prom.

1425
01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:33.946
-Really?
-[Ms. Diann] In eighth grade?

1426
01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:36.907
-They didn't do that stuff.
-High school prom?

1427
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:38.367
[Ms. Diann] No. prom. I didn't go to.

1428
01:15:39.409 --> 01:15:41.995
[Tai] I would go with you.
Ms. Diann. but I have a date.

1429
01:15:42.746 --> 01:15:43.747
[Ms. Diann] Who's your date?

1430

1505
01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:47.133
I'm hopeful. and I'm nervous.

-You got one more. okay?
-Oh. yeah.

1540
01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:30.236
I know everyone else talks about
how their track team is a family.

1541
01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.989
but my track team
is like an actual family.

1542
01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:37.494
and family is everything because
it pushes me to be a better person.

1543

1558
01:23:53.486 --> 01:23:57.866
I kind of just want to go home right now.
because this year is not a good year.

1559
01:23:57.949 --> 01:23:59.284
like my other years.

1560
01:23:59.951 --> 01:24:02.954
but tomorrow. I just hope I do good.

1561
01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:05.915
I'm going to stick to the strategy
that I have with the 800.

1562
01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:09.836
but this time do better.
because this is for the team.

1563
01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.172
I'm gonna do good.

1564
01:24:18.094 --> 01:24:19.637
[Coach Jean] Listen to me carefully.

1565

Even if you're in second. don't panic.

1567
01:24:24.809 --> 01:24:29.773
just go smooth until you catch up.
but catch up. [chuckles]

1568
01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:32.442

They have some good competition in this.

1571
01:24:47.832 --> 01:24:50.502
[Coach Jean]<i> Track and field</i>
<i>is not a team sport.</i>

1572

<i>when you get on the track.</i>

1573
01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:57.717
<i>you get on by yourself</i>
<i>and you have to do the work.</i>

1574
01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:04.057
<i>You have to get beyond</i>
<i>the hurdles that are put before you.</i>

1575
01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:09.979
<i>So it makes you strong in spirit</i>

1576

1603

Today is an important day.

1604
01:27:23.863 --> 01:27:25.990
Because it's the day before school.

1605
01:27:26.741 --> 01:27:29.827
{\an8}And today is when
you get to get your hair done.

1606
01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:34.207
and most importantly get mentally
prepared to say goodbye to having fun.

1607
01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:36.167
I'm just nervous.

1608
01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:40.588
I hope that the kids are nice at school.
'cause I'm going to a private school.

1609
01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:43.758
I don't know. I'm not really rich either.

1610
01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:46.886
Maybe I don't look cool enough.

1611
01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:53.226
Today I'm very… nervous.

1612
01:27:53.309 --> 01:27:55.103
I don't really want to go to high school.

1613
01:27:55.186 --> 01:27:58.022
I mean. I'd like to go back
to middle school.

1614
01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.274
Not only 'cause. like…

1615
01:28:00.483 --> 01:28:01.985
Mostly because…

1616
01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:04.696
I don't like change all that much.

1617
01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:06.239
Change is different.

1618
01:28:06.322 --> 01:28:08.950
and I don't know how I'll react to change.

1619
01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:16.332
So. Rainn. it's the day before school.

1620
01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:17.875
[Rainn] Oh. no duh.

1621
01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:19.752
-How are you feeling?
-Great.

1622
01:28:19.836 --> 01:28:20.920
Just like any other day.

1623
01:28:22.213 --> 01:28:23.298
{\an8}-Not nervous?
-Nope.

1624
01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:26.843
What are you
looking forward to for the school year?

1625
01:28:26.926 --> 01:28:30.513
Um. I'm looking forward to…
peace and love.

1626
01:28:31.764 --> 01:28:33.725
Okay. will that be all?

1627
01:28:37.353 --> 01:28:40.606
[Coach Jean]<i> Tell your mother to take a</i>

<i>Yeah. let's keep up the good work. 'cause…</i>

1632
01:28:50.783 --> 01:28:53.619
<i>I just want you to remember.</i>
<i>when you're in school.</i>

1633
01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:58.833
{\an8}<i>before you say something.</i>
<i>do something. just think to yourself.</i>

1634
01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:01.586
<i>"Would I do this</i>
<i>if Jean was standing next to me?"</i>

1635
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:02.503
[Tai groans]

1636
01:29:02.587 --> 01:29:05.131
[Coach Jean]<i> "Would I say this if Jean</i>
<i>was standing next to me?"</i>

1637
01:29:05.214 --> 01:29:06.090
[Tai chuckles] No.

1638
01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:09.260
[Coach Jean]<i> Just say that to yourself.</i>
<i>and then you'll be fine.</i>

1639
01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.012
I will.

1640
01:29:21.064 --> 01:29:21.898
TT.

1641
01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:24.484
Tai? Tai?

1642
01:29:25.276 --> 01:29:26.319
What time you leaving?

1643
01:29:27.236 --> 01:29:28.863
Okay. 7:15 is good.

1644
01:29:30.948 --> 01:29:32.450
Rainny. what time are you leaving?

1645
01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:34.202
[Tonia]<i> Going through</i>
<i>what they went through.</i>

1646
01:29:34.285 --> 01:29:36.829
<i>like losing their home. their bedroom.</i>

1647
01:29:36.913 --> 01:29:38.998
<i>having to live in a shelter.</i>

1648
01:29:39.082 --> 01:29:44.045
<i>then all of a sudden</i>
<i>becoming these. like. track stars…</i>

1649
01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:50.468
<i>I think this whole thing just</i>
<i>made them more aware of life.</i>

1650
01:29:55.973 --> 01:29:59.894
<i>They're wonderful.</i>
<i>and they're still lovable and loving.</i>

<i>Little women.</i>

1653
01:30:06.317 --> 01:30:09.195
<i>I would describe</i>
<i>Tai. Rainn and Brooke as little women.</i>

1654
01:30:12.698 --> 01:30:16.577
[Coach Jean]<i> They always had that talent</i>
<i>deep inside of them.</i>

1655
01:30:17.537 --> 01:30:22.625
<i>but they needed someone</i>

1656
01:30:22.708 --> 01:30:24.544
<i>And that's what I'm there for.</i>
