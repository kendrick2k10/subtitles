Thank you. What a pleasant eviction.

I mean. why didn't she tell us?

177

Oh. no. I don't have a job.

What are you gonna do for money?

who wanted to invest in my fashion line.

225

in your fish fillet?

231

I'm sorry. I almost died.

Now. why would I be "Mr. Choochie's?"

00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:10.250
And now. I never bake anymore.

327
00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:12.250
and I feel so unfulfilled.

328
00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:14.500
You need to change your life.

329
00:15:14.958 --> 00:15:18.208
You can because you're strong.

330
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.875
So. are you done with your plate?

331
00:15:23.333 --> 00:15:25.250
- Oh. yeah.
- [chuckles]

332
00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:28.542
[laughs]

333
00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:33.708
Since when does it take you 20 minutes
to service one table?

334
00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:35.125
[Wendy] We started talking.

335
00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:38.167
- [Carl] You can't just sit and hang out.
- [Wendy] She believes in me. Carl.

336
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:39.917
Oh. my God!

337
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:41.500
Thanks!

338
00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:52.000
Hi. I had a huge day.

339
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.375
- Why are you sitting out here?
- [Jenny] Oh. I locked myself out.

340
00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:57.792
- Well. let's get inside before--
- Anne. is this lunatic your sister?

341
00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:59.083
I told you.

342
00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:01.083
She threatened to call the cops
because she thought I was. what?

343
00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:03.042
- Was it loitering?
- You were loitering.

344
00:16:03.042 --> 00:16:05.333
I thought you were loitering
with an intent to murder.

345
00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:06.458
Oh. do I look like a murderer?

346
00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:08.917
- Yes. Well. yes. you do.
- [Jenny] Oh. really?

347
00:16:09.042 --> 00:16:12.208
- [Francine] I can see your brassiere.
- Okay. okay. I'm... I'm sorry about her.

348
00:16:12.458 --> 00:16:14.333
- Like--
- Sorry about me? What did I do?

349
00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:16.292
- Why are you-- Why?
- Put a sock in it.

350
00:16:16.625 --> 00:16:20.833
Okay. so. I went to go get coffee
and I met this woman.

351
00:16:20.833 --> 00:16:24.875
Oh. my God! She was so sad.
But we got to talking. and I helped her.

352
00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:27.292
And helping her made me feel better.

353
00:16:27.292 --> 00:16:29.917
And just like that. I saw it.
I saw the path forward.

354
00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:31.625
Don't move my stuff.

355
00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:33.875
Why do you have
a bobblehead of Justin Timberlake?

356
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.708
It's Terry McTeer.
and it's limited edition.

357
00:16:36.708 --> 00:16:38.417
It’s from the 300th episode!

358
00:16:38.417 --> 00:16:41.958
Do you know the heated eBay war
I had to endure to get that?

359
00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:44.833
- [Jenny] It's Justin Timberlake.
- It's Terry McTeer.

360
00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:48.917
Okay. as I was saying. I have decided

361
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:50.875
I am going to become...

362
00:16:51.625 --> 00:16:52.667
a life coach.

363
00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:57.583
- You know. like Oprah.
- [laughs] Oh. yeah. Yes. Linguini!

364
00:16:57.583 --> 00:17:00.250
- What's so funny? This is my destiny.
- [Anne] Oh. there you are.

365
00:17:00.417 --> 00:17:01.583
Yeah. you and your destinies.

366
00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:04.167
First. it was figure skating.
then it was acting. and then...

367
00:17:04.167 --> 00:17:05.917
And then you wanted to be a music icon.

368
00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:07.833
- And then it was fashion design.
- Yeah. but this is different.

369
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
How?

370
00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:12.542
I'll show you. you know what?
Because you're gonna be my first project.

371
00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:14.208
I don't need a life coach.

372
00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:17.000
Uh. really? Because from what I can tell.

373
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.167
you’re like a 28-year-old woman.
living the life of a 98-year-old widower.

374
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.708
I'm 33.

375
00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.958
And why am I always a man
in your hypotheticals?

376
00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:27.667
Because men are worse.

377
00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:29.542
[Anne] Well.
I like my life just the way it is.

378

[Marge] Did you see it? I was like.
"Don't we work with that girl?"

397
00:18:31.042 --> 00:18:32.542
And I was like. "Oh. my God. Yes. I do."

398
00:18:32.542 --> 00:18:34.083

[Jenny] <i>You are viral!</i>

416
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:29.375
I posted it last night.

417

and then when I woke up
this morning it was everywhere.

423
00:19:44.708 --> 00:19:46.875
She just floats through life
without ever thinking

424
00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:48.458
about how her actions affect other people.

425
00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:51.417
Did you know that when were kids
we went to the Heinz Ketchup Museum.

426
00:19:51.417 --> 00:19:53.500
our father brought us there.
and she was furious

427
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.958
'cause she wanted to watch <i>Supercop 3.</i>
and she'd just gotten it on DVD.

00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:58.375
<i>And. so. she knocks over
an entire display of ketchup</i>

429
00:19:58.375 --> 00:20:00.208

I didn't get to have that experience.
Now. look at me now.

I think it's just tomatoes. though.

- You know. with sugar and spices.
- Oh. my God.

436
00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:13.125
They want me to be on local news.

437
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.333
- [Trav] Dope!
- I don't want to be news.

438
00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:17.000

So. which is it? What are you?

652

I... am Ben Franklin.

653
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.042
Then why don't you have wooden teeth
like George Washington?

654
00:30:39.042 --> 00:30:43.083
- Jenny.
- And... lifting.

655
00:30:43.083 --> 00:30:47.458
- Can you just let him be Ben Franklin?
- In my family. we have wrinkly foreheads.

656
00:30:47.958 --> 00:30:50.167
I just want to let you know. sir.
that you're doing a great job.

657

Well. he's using a computer.
How very 17th century.

659
00:30:56.667 --> 00:30:58.375

- What?

660
00:30:58.583 --> 00:31:00.417

661
00:31:00.417 --> 00:31:02.917

I. Ben Franklin. know it.

663

If you need any help.
don't hesitate to call.

664
00:31:10.042 --> 00:31:12.750

- Yes. On the phone.

665

Welcome to the Betsy Ross suite.

00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:38.875
Oh. can you take this? Thank you.

673
00:31:40.792 --> 00:31:42.583
Right. Cute.

674
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.458
Jenny. we’re too old to share a bed.

675
00:31:45.625 --> 00:31:51.250
Speak for yourself. Ben Franklin.
The thirties are the new twenties.

676
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.000
Since when are you in your thirties?

677
00:31:53.125 --> 00:31:55.708
Oh. since I did a guess-my-age filter
and it said thirty...

678
00:31:57.167 --> 00:31:58.167
nine.

679
00:32:03.875 --> 00:32:07.208
You know. this place sucks.
Let's go to a real hotel.

680
00:32:07.333 --> 00:32:09.500
They have to have rooms
they keep open just in case.

681
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:11.333
- I'll get them to give us one.
- How?

682
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.458
Oh. I am amazing at getting stuff.

683
00:32:14.458 --> 00:32:18.417
I get really emotional and talk a lot.
so they get confused.

684
00:32:18.417 --> 00:32:21.917
and then they're willing to do
whatever they can to make it stop.

685
00:32:21.917 --> 00:32:23.667
See. just one second. Like this. [inhales]

686

Please! Oh. my God!

687

I know you’re only serving
the breakfast menu.

688
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.583
but my husband needs fries!

689
00:32:31.583 --> 00:32:34.792
He has a rare kidney condition.
and if he doesn’t get salt. he’ll die!

690
00:32:35.167 --> 00:32:38.667
I’m too young to be a widow! I’m only 39.

691
00:32:39.875 --> 00:32:41.667
See? Works every time.

692
00:32:41.667 --> 00:32:44.583
You would publicly humiliate yourself
just to eat fries at breakfast?

693
00:32:45.333 --> 00:32:46.542
How is that humiliating?

Oh. it's quite all right. [chuckles]

823

- Maybe. like. a drink later?
- Well. I'm married. And gay.

824
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.458

<i>You’re running out of time.</i>

836
00:40:04.083 --> 00:40:06.458
He’s gonna make it

837
00:40:06.792 --> 00:40:10.708
Oh. that’s kinda brilliant.
Uh. in a bad way.

838

- [Anne] Linguini.
- We are gonna get him back. I promise.

841
00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:18.458
Don’t look at your phone.

842

Do you have a laptop or something?
‘Cause I can't sleep without noise.

Yeah. in that blue bag.

Ah. whoo! Pop!

845
00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:34.792
- When did you get this? 1970?
- [Jenny] Chad gave it to me.

846
00:40:34.917 --> 00:40:37.333
He was with the CIA.
so you know it’s powerful.

847
00:40:40.083 --> 00:40:42.292
- Who is Chad?
- [Jenny] Oh. you remember Chad.

848
00:40:42.292 --> 00:40:44.167
I mean. aren’t you supposed
to have a great memory?

849
00:40:44.167 --> 00:40:45.792
Yeah. for things of note.

850
00:40:47.167 --> 00:40:50.875
Oh. well. I remember
everyone you've ever dated

851
00:40:50.875 --> 00:40:53.125
since it was just that one
weird kid who was so pale

852
00:40:53.125 --> 00:40:54.417
he was practically see-through.

853
00:40:54.958 --> 00:40:57.333
Francoise was not see-through.

854
00:40:57.333 --> 00:41:00.250
Yeah. well. It was like someone
Saran-wrapped a skeleton.

855
00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:03.542
- Ooh. Kahi Bounce Balm?
- No.

856
00:41:03.542 --> 00:41:05.333
Are you sure? It’s Korean.

857
00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:08.500
And also. Francoise and I weren’t dating.
we were just friends.

858
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.667
It wasn’t his fault
that he was allergic to the sun.

859
00:41:10.667 --> 00:41:12.583
- What are you doing?
- I want space.

860
00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:15.917
Ah. okay. Well. I sleep with two pillows.

861
00:41:15.917 --> 00:41:18.083
- Thank you very much. Yes. I do.
- Do you sleep with two pillows?

862
00:41:18.208 --> 00:41:20.583
Because you can sleep
with two pillows on the floor.

863
00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:22.542
I’m sorry. I’m injured.
I'm not sleeping on the floor.

864
00:41:22.667 --> 00:41:25.250
- I'm not sleeping on the floor. either.
- Then sleep on the chair.

865
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.542
I don't wanna sleep in a sitting position.

866
00:41:27.542 --> 00:41:29.375
Oh. my God. What is the big deal?

867
00:41:29.375 --> 00:41:32.875
- We used to sleep together all the time.
- Yeah. 20 years ago. before you left.

868
00:41:37.958 --> 00:41:39.458
Fine. pillow wall.

This is not half. by the way.

[Anne] Yes. it is.

872
00:41:54.333 --> 00:41:56.500
I know you're really nervous
about tomorrow.

873
00:41:58.375 --> 00:42:01.042
But is there at least
a small part of you that's excited?

874
00:42:03.708 --> 00:42:04.708
Maybe.

875
00:42:05.542 --> 00:42:06.542
A little bit.

Oh. don’t think about them.

909
00:44:02.208 --> 00:44:05.500
Just focus on the fact that you need
this money to save Mr. Linguini's life.

910
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.333
That’s not helping.

911

You're not gonna be bad.
You're gonna be great.

when women are good at things. either!

why I'm good is because I'm at home.

to make a pro-con list.

1136
00:53:48.667 --> 00:53:51.333
Oh! [chuckles] Look at you. Miss Yum.

1137
00:53:51.458 --> 00:53:55.083
You have read my 1772 letter
to Joseph Priestly. have you not?

1138
00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:56.375
- Well...
- That's wonderful. [chuckles]

1139
00:53:56.375 --> 00:53:57.667
- [Jenny] Annie!
- Uh-oh. the enemy.

1140
00:53:57.667 --> 00:54:00.375
[chuckles] Oh. my God. Oh. my God.
The <i>Quiz</i> just emailed.

1141
00:54:00.667 --> 00:54:02.333
They said to expect a call soon.

1142
00:54:03.083 --> 00:54:05.167
- Oh. my God. I can't believe it.
- [Jenny chuckles. shrieks]

1143
00:54:05.167 --> 00:54:09.250
- I'm... I'm... I'm gonna be on the show.
- And you thought I could not be Oprah.

1144
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:10.333
- [chuckles]
- Well. too bad

1145
00:54:10.333 --> 00:54:11.417
the Choochie's money isn't real.

1146
00:54:11.417 --> 00:54:13.167
You'd be flying
around the world like Mary Poppins

1147
00:54:13.167 --> 00:54:16.542
- with that gigantic unnecessary bag.
- Mm-hmm.

1148
00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:18.625
- Well...
- [Anne] What?

1149
00:54:20.042 --> 00:54:22.792
Um. I lied about the Choochie's money.

1150
00:54:22.958 --> 00:54:24.583
- Yeah. I know.
- No. no. no. no.

1151
00:54:24.708 --> 00:54:27.625
I lied about lying
about the Choochie's money.

1152
00:54:27.625 --> 00:54:29.083
It's totally real!

1153
00:54:29.333 --> 00:54:31.292
I'm getting a giant check.
just like on TV.

1154
00:54:31.292 --> 00:54:33.167
- I made them put that in the contract.
- But...

1155
00:54:33.542 --> 00:54:35.833
I'm sorry. [chuckles]
Uh. Wh... what are you saying?

1156
00:54:35.833 --> 00:54:40.542
Oh. I knew that the only way
that you would do this is if you thought

1157
00:54:40.542 --> 00:54:42.292
it was the only way.

1158
00:54:43.958 --> 00:54:45.042
Life coaching.

1159
00:54:45.042 --> 00:54:50.208
Yeah. but we could've paid off the debt
and I could have Linguini back.

1160
00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:52.708
Yeah. but I told you
that the money hasn't come in yet.

1161
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Oh. my God!

1162
00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:57.000
- Even your lies are lies.
- I'm not lying.

1163
00:54:57.583 --> 00:54:58.792
You always do this.

1164
00:54:58.958 --> 00:55:01.542
You don't think
about the consequences of your actions.

1165
00:55:01.542 --> 00:55:05.167
Mr. Linguini is everything to me.
and to you. he's just a pawn.

1166
00:55:05.875 --> 00:55:08.042
- I thought you were trying to help me.
- I am.

1167
00:55:08.042 --> 00:55:11.875
I'm helping you get him back
while also seizing your destiny!

1168
00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:16.250
- Oh. my God. destiny isn't real!
- Yes. it is. We all have a purpose.

1169
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:17.375
We just need to find it.

1170
00:55:17.375 --> 00:55:19.625
No. See. that's just a lie
that you tell yourself

1171
00:55:19.625 --> 00:55:21.875
because you're just chasing
these stupid dreams.

1172
00:55:21.875 --> 00:55:23.917
then blaming whatever you can
when they don't work out.

1173
00:55:23.917 --> 00:55:28.208
But the truth is. it's you.
You're selfish. You're reckless.

1174
00:55:28.708 --> 00:55:31.083
- You are just like Mom!
- Don't say that!

1175
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.875
Just take some responsibility
for your life.

1176
00:55:34.875 --> 00:55:36.750
Stop being such a goddamn loser.

1177
00:55:40.917 --> 00:55:42.333
- [Anne groans]
- [crowd gasps]

1178
00:55:42.458 --> 00:55:43.875
You're the loser!

1179
00:55:44.375 --> 00:55:46.333
- Yes. I am lonely and currently unhoused...
- [speaks indistinctly]

1180
00:55:46.458 --> 00:55:49.042
...and my life hasn't turned out
exactly the way I wanted.

1181
00:55:49.458 --> 00:55:52.875
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to be an Asian woman in this country?

1182
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.250
[crowd murmuring]

1183
00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:56.417
- Oh. my God!
- [Jenny] But at least I've lived!

1184
00:55:56.417 --> 00:55:57.625
What have you done with your life?

1185
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:59.500
I mean. you just. like.
hide out in your robot house

1186
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.625
just while watching the <i>Quiz.</i>
watching the <i>Quiz.</i>

1187
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:04.458
Yeah. and take care of Mom
and lend you money. and support myself.

1188
00:56:04.458 --> 00:56:06.583
I am responsible for everything!

1189
00:56:06.583 --> 00:56:09.542
- Excuse me. ladies. if you don't mind--
- Fuck off. Ben Franklin!

1190
00:56:09.708 --> 00:56:11.750
- [crowd gasps]
- I absolutely will.

1191
00:56:11.958 --> 00:56:14.042
You're the older sister.
you're supposed to help me.

1192
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:17.500
But you never have. you were never there.
All you care about is yourself!

1193
00:56:17.667 --> 00:56:20.083
That is not true.
I was always looking out for you.

1194
00:56:20.792 --> 00:56:21.792
Yeah? When?

1195
00:56:21.792 --> 00:56:25.000
In Burbank!
When you shit in the goddamn hole!

1196
00:56:27.167 --> 00:56:29.167
You didn't bury it deep enough.

1197
00:56:30.125 --> 00:56:31.208
<i>So. the next day.</i>

1198
00:56:31.333 --> 00:56:33.208
<i>when So-Yung and Na-Yung
and I got back from Starbucks...</i>

1199
00:56:33.208 --> 00:56:35.292
Appa said you can live with us
and you can come with me

1200
00:56:35.292 --> 00:56:36.708
to UCLA next year!

1201
00:56:36.708 --> 00:56:38.875
- And we can start our fashion line!
- Yeah!

1202
00:56:38.875 --> 00:56:39.958
- Oh. my God!
- Oh. Jenny!

1203
00:56:39.958 --> 00:56:41.167
[Jin] Uh. Guys.

1204
00:56:41.458 --> 00:56:45.333
- Come here. You gotta see this.
- [Jenny] <i>Cousin Jin found it.</i>

1205
00:56:45.958 --> 00:56:48.708
- [Na-Yung] Ew!
- [So-Yung] Tiger. did you do this?

1206
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.875
- How could that come out of Tiger?
- [So-Yung] Well. then who did it?

1207
00:56:54.417 --> 00:56:55.750
[Jenny] <i>I knew right away it was you.</i>

1208
00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.042
<i>And it was just a matter of time
before they figured it out.</i>

1209
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:07.833
<i>So. I told them I did it.</i>

1210
00:57:10.292 --> 00:57:13.083
[all. in slow motion] Ew!

1211
00:57:15.125 --> 00:57:17.667
Uncle Joon was gonna let us live
with them in Burbank

1212
00:57:17.667 --> 00:57:21.792
'cause Mom was. like. on a bender.
But everything changed after that.

1213
00:57:22.875 --> 00:57:25.708
I mean. do... do you know how insane
an 18-year-old would have to be

1214
00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.208
to shit in a hole?

1215
00:57:27.417 --> 00:57:29.375
[crowd murmuring]

1216
00:57:29.542 --> 00:57:30.792
Why didn't you tell me?

1217
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.667
Because you were eight.

1218
00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:36.667
[somber music playing]

1219
00:57:39.625 --> 00:57:42.000
- Asshole!
- [crowd murmuring]

1220
00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:44.958
[footsteps receding]

1221
00:57:54.958 --> 00:57:58.417
Anne. where is my 100 bucks?

1222
00:58:00.208 --> 00:58:03.917
- [sobs. sniffles]
- [Francine] Anne...

1223
00:58:05.375 --> 00:58:07.792
You... you... you... you wanna come in?

1224
00:58:08.292 --> 00:58:10.042
- [sobs. sniffles]
- [Francine] Come on.

1225
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.750
- [kettle whistling]

1226

- [Francine] Here.
- [cutlery clattering]

1227
00:58:23.125 --> 00:58:24.333
[grunts]

1228
00:58:25.375 --> 00:58:28.000
I didn't know
you were a Pee-wee Herman fan.

1229
00:58:28.917 --> 00:58:30.500
Who the hell is Pee-wee Herman?

1230
00:58:31.375 --> 00:58:32.417
P-- Uh.

1231
00:58:33.875 --> 00:58:38.667
That's Alan Cumming from <i>The Good Wife.</i>
Such a wonderful actor.

1232
00:58:38.667 --> 00:58:42.333
And that Scottish accent of his.
[chuckles]

1233
00:58:43.042 --> 00:58:45.708
That's not Alan Cumming.
that's P-- That's Paul Reubens.

1234
00:58:45.708 --> 00:58:48.792
He plays Pee-wee... Herman.

1235
00:58:48.792 --> 00:58:53.125
I think I would know
who my favorite actor is.

1236
00:58:53.125 --> 00:58:56.792
thank you very much. That is Alan Cumming.

1237
00:58:58.125 --> 00:58:59.208
Mm-hmm.

1238
00:59:01.625 --> 00:59:03.833
So. what's wrong with you?

1239
00:59:05.333 --> 00:59:06.375
I just...

1240
00:59:08.208 --> 00:59:09.417
I thought I was happy.

1241
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:11.542
And maybe I wasn't.

1242
00:59:12.667 --> 00:59:15.583
I've just been so scared.

1243
00:59:16.333 --> 00:59:21.167
You know. scared of... of being judged.
being laughed at.

1244
00:59:22.167 --> 00:59:25.458
When I was younger.
I wasted so much energy

1245
00:59:25.583 --> 00:59:27.542
trying to get people to like me.

1246
00:59:28.667 --> 00:59:30.917
And for what? Hmm?

1247
00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:35.708
So. I could get invited
to some potluck dinner party?

1248
00:59:35.708 --> 00:59:39.958
- And terrible games of charades?
- Ugh. I hate charades.

1249
00:59:39.958 --> 00:59:44.750
Oh. I love charades.
I am an excellent guesser.

1250
00:59:45.083 --> 00:59:48.750
So long as the person who's acting out
the clues is not a total imbecile.

1251
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:50.792
- which they usually are.
- [scoffs]

1252
00:59:50.917 --> 00:59:52.625
I've been alive a long time.

1253
00:59:53.667 --> 00:59:55.083
I've met a lot of people.

1254
00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:57.750
I only liked one.

1255
00:59:59.958 --> 01:00:00.958
Was it me?

1256
01:00:02.208 --> 01:00:04.667
No. You get too much mail.

1257
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:11.250
The point is... [sighs]
...you don't want to waste time

1258
01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:14.333
looking for happiness in other people...

1259
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.250
because happiness...

1260
01:00:18.792 --> 01:00:22.500
happiness... does not exist.

1261
01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:25.792
- Mm-hmm.
- [cellphone ringing]

01:16:41.625 --> 01:16:45.375
- [chants] "Ron's dog! Ron's dog!"
- [audience member coughing]

1608
01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.875
Playable characters in <i>Mario Kart 64.</i>
This is fun.

1609
01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:52.208
- Mario. Luigi...
- [bell dinging]

1610
01:16:52.208 --> 01:16:54.667
- ...Princess Peach. for the women...
- [women cheering]

1611
01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:57.208
- ...Donkey Kong. and uh. Koopa Troopa.
- [buzzer buzzing]

1612
01:16:57.333 --> 01:17:00.542
- [laughs] Bowser. moron.
- [bar patron 1] You suck. Ron!

1613
01:17:00.542 --> 01:17:02.417
Cruciferous vegetables.

1614
01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:05.458
- Broccoli. cauliflower. horseradish. kale...
- [bell dinging]

1615
01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:07.875
...cabbage. kohlrabi. bok choy.

1616
01:17:08.042 --> 01:17:10.375
- Beethoven. Mozart...
- [bell dinging]

1617
01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:12.167
- [sneezes]
- ...Salieri. Strauss.

1618
01:17:12.292 --> 01:17:14.667
- [buzzer buzzing]
- Right. He's Romantic era.

1619
01:17:14.792 --> 01:17:17.333
which one could argue
still is classical music.

1620
01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:19.542
Anyhow. now. may I. uh...

1621
01:17:20.667 --> 01:17:22.000
- [Mr. Linguini groans]
- Come here. Oh...

1622
01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:24.000
- Okay. [chuckles]
- [Terry] Hmm.

1623
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.292
- Hide and seek. Haydn!
- [Anne chuckling]

1624
01:17:25.292 --> 01:17:26.833
- [bell dinging. chiming]
- [Ron] It works!

1625
01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:31.417
- Such a jerk.
- And for the bonus round. simple machines.

1626
01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:34.042
- Lever. pulley. wedge. screw...
- [bell dinging]

1627
01:17:34.042 --> 01:17:35.625
...wheel and axle. inclined plane.

1628
01:17:35.625 --> 01:17:39.542
And that's all of them!
You finished with 24 seconds remaining.

1629
01:17:39.708 --> 01:17:41.208
which means you get a bonus

1630
01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:44.875
of 12.000 dollars.
I believe that's a new record.

1631
01:17:45.375 --> 01:17:46.958
- Is that right?
- [Terry] Can we check on that?

1632
01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:49.042
- [crew members] Yeah.
- Checking. What is that?

1633
01:17:49.167 --> 01:17:50.458
I don't-- It is? It is!

1634
01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.167
- [audience cheering]
- [Terry] That is the highest bonus

1635
01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.542
in the history of the show.

1636
01:17:53.542 --> 01:17:55.167
- Way to go. Annie!
- [Terry] Congratulations. Anne!

1637
01:17:55.167 --> 01:17:57.750
- [bell dinging]
- Whoo!

1638
01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:59.167
- Oh. huzzah!
- [Anne] <i>Thank you.</i>

1639
01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:00.958
[Terry] What a comeback.

1640
01:18:01.083 --> 01:18:03.042
This is just like
the classic sports film.

1641
01:18:03.042 --> 01:18:06.375
<i>Mighty Ducks 2.</i>"Ducks fly together."

1642
01:18:06.375 --> 01:18:08.000
What a wonderful message.
Have you seen it?

1643
01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:09.958
- I've seen it multiple times.
- Oh...

1644
01:18:09.958 --> 01:18:12.958
Yes. it's in my top ten.
It might be my top two.

1645
01:18:13.458 --> 01:18:14.583
I think it's my number one.

1646
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:16.333
Will the comeback continue.

1647
01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:20.000
or will another record be broken tonight
by Ron winning his 84th game?

1648
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.333
It all depends on the final round.

1649
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.250
- Time for the flip.
- [audience applauding]

1650
01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:25.500
[Terry] Ron. you have the honors.

1651
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.500
[upbeat music playing]

1652
01:18:29.875 --> 01:18:31.500
[Ron] Whoo! Flip it! [grunts]

1653
01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:35.458
[audience] Ten. nine. eight. seven.

1654
01:18:35.625 --> 01:18:40.917
six. five. four. three. two. one!

1655
01:18:42.167 --> 01:18:43.250
[thudding]

1656
01:18:44.542 --> 01:18:46.125
- [audience] Show it!
- Oh...

1657
01:18:46.125 --> 01:18:48.625
- [audience cheering. applauding]
- Charades.

1658
01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:53.083
When we return.
Anne and Ron will compete in "Show It."

1659
01:18:53.083 --> 01:18:55.083
- [chuckles]
- [Glenn] And we're out.

1660
01:18:55.792 --> 01:18:59.458
"Show It" is where Heacock
becomes a peacock.

1661
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:02.292
Bart.

1662
01:19:02.417 --> 01:19:05.000
- Hmm.
- How are you. buddy?

1663
01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:06.875
- All right. let's get in sync here.
- Okay.

1664
01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.792
[both vocalize]

1665
01:19:19.083 --> 01:19:24.583
- Oh. no. [coughs. grunts]
- Oh. no. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

1666
01:19:24.750 --> 01:19:28.375
No. I'm fine.
It just got down the wrong pipe.

1667
01:19:28.375 --> 01:19:29.958
- [Anne] Uh-huh.
- [grunts]

1668
01:19:30.167 --> 01:19:31.792
- I always thought you ate crackers...
- [Terry] No.

1669
01:19:31.917 --> 01:19:34.542
- ...between the commercials.
- You caught me. [chuckles]

1670
01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:37.792
My wife. Cecilia.
worries about my sugar intake.

1671
01:19:37.917 --> 01:19:40.250
so. I just... I just say they're crackers.

1672
01:19:40.458 --> 01:19:43.542
[chuckles] What are you hiding from. huh?

1673
01:19:46.917 --> 01:19:48.500
I don't know what I'm doing. [chuckles]

1674
01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:50.875
All those...

1675
01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:53.750
...people watching and...

1676
01:19:54.667 --> 01:19:55.833
I'm gonna lose.

1677
01:20:00.958 --> 01:20:02.500
[sighs. clicks tongue]

1678
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:05.500
You know... [smacks lips. sighs]

1679
01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.750
...whenever I look
at this bow tie right here.

1680
01:20:07.875 --> 01:20:12.042
it makes me think of one contestant
from that night. Oscar from Texas.

1681
01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:17.542
We had a wonderful conversation
about how he makes his own jams.

1682
01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:20.875
He tries these wild combinations.
like blueberry rhubarb.

1683
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.667
What? [chuckles]
And he's like an artist. but with jams.

1684
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.958
Oh! This was the night
that Aparna from New Jersey

1685
01:20:30.958 --> 01:20:33.958
played her mandolin for us
during the commercial break.

1686
01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:42.833
And that night. Mike from Maine
brought me a snowball in a cooler

1687
01:20:42.833 --> 01:20:47.208
‘cause he... he remembered that I had said
I... I missed New England winters.

1688
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.792
Great guy.
None of them actually won their games.

1689
01:20:51.958 --> 01:20:54.500
You know. like most contestants.
they were just here for one night. but...

1690
01:20:55.292 --> 01:20:57.000
I don't think of them as failures.

1691
01:20:58.833 --> 01:21:00.583
I'm just glad
I got a chance to talk to them.

1692
01:21:00.583 --> 01:21:02.625
and they... they got a chance to play.

1693
01:21:04.958 --> 01:21:08.083
Don't ruin what might be
your only night here

1694
01:21:08.083 --> 01:21:09.958
by making it about winning or losing.

1695
01:21:12.792 --> 01:21:14.917
Just try to think
of what you wanna remember.

1696
01:21:15.792 --> 01:21:16.875
As for me...

1697
01:21:17.792 --> 01:21:18.917
no matter who wins...

1698
01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:25.458
this one will always remind me
of Anne from Pennsylvania

1699
01:21:25.667 --> 01:21:26.875
who brought her dog.

1700
01:21:28.042 --> 01:21:31.417
- There you are. We need you on stage.
- Yeah. right away. Glenn.

1701
01:21:31.417 --> 01:21:32.750
- Thank you so much.
- [Glenn sighs]

1702
01:21:33.583 --> 01:21:35.750
It's Glenn's world
and we're all just living in it. you know?

1703
01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:38.125
- [chuckles]
- [Terry] All right. Ready?

1704
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.667
- [sighs]
- [intriguing music playing]

1705
01:21:49.792 --> 01:21:52.875
And legally. you have to allow
service animals. but also.

1706
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.958
- it's the right thing to do. you know?
- [crowd cheering. applauding]

1707
01:21:55.083 --> 01:21:57.083
And you know what? Not only for Anne.
but for society. as well.

1708
01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:59.542
[Mercedes] Sure. it's just that
it's clearly a fake vest. so...

1709
01:21:59.542 --> 01:22:01.625
[Jenny] I know. but what side of history
do you wanna be on?

1710
01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:03.167
[Mercedes] Okay.
you can't pull that with me.

1711
01:22:03.167 --> 01:22:06.167
You know what? I think it's probably
gonna be really great for ratings.

1712
01:22:06.167 --> 01:22:07.917
- You know what?
- I wanna change my partner.

1713
01:22:08.375 --> 01:22:09.708
- What?
- What?

1714
01:22:10.042 --> 01:22:11.417
I wanna play with my sister.

1715
01:22:12.333 --> 01:22:14.042
- Jenny.
- [Glenn] You can't do that.

1716
01:22:14.292 --> 01:22:16.708
- Glenn. it's her game. I think she can.
- [Jenny] What? Uh.

1717
01:22:16.958 --> 01:22:19.125
You want me to guess?
But I don't know anything.

1718
01:22:20.292 --> 01:22:21.292
You know me.

1719
01:22:21.292 --> 01:22:24.917
And... and win or lose.
we'll... we'll... we'll do it together.

1720
01:22:25.458 --> 01:22:29.250
- [Glenn] All right. Switch them.
- I came all this way.

1721
01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:31.875
- I know. Fran. I'm so sorry about that.
- Ma'am. this way.

1722
01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:33.958
Um. If I could get you
and Mr. Linguini to a seat?

1723
01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:35.667
- [Anne] Sorry. Francine.
- [Francine] Now. I have to watch

1724
01:22:35.667 --> 01:22:36.625
the rest of this shit.

1725
01:22:36.625 --> 01:22:38.208
She can't do that.
You can't switch partners.

1726
01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:39.375
This is so unfair.

1727
01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:41.667
What are you gonna do next?
Give her all the answers?

1728
01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:43.208
- Welcome back.
- [clears throat]

1729
01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:44.833
I hope you enjoyed your break.

1730
01:22:45.042 --> 01:22:48.083
Joining us for the final round
is Ron's friend. Bart.

1731
01:22:48.667 --> 01:22:51.083
and Anne's sister--
I'm sorry. I never got your name.

1732
01:22:51.208 --> 01:22:52.292
Oh. Jenny.

1733
01:22:52.417 --> 01:22:54.458
- [Terry] <i>Hi. Jenny. I'm Terry.</i>
- Oh. hello. Satan.

1734
01:22:54.583 --> 01:22:57.750
Ron and Bart are up first.
so we'll ask Anne and Jenny

1735
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:59.625
to step on the "Show It" coin.

1736
01:23:00.458 --> 01:23:03.208
Gentlemen. take your places.
Best of luck.

1737
01:23:03.458 --> 01:23:04.667
[Ron] I'm ready. Terry.

1738
01:23:05.167 --> 01:23:09.083
- And your time starts now.
- [bell dinging]

1739
01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:13.333
- [timer ticking]
- Book. Magazine. Mag.

1740
01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:19.667
- Shopping. Cart. Mag.
- He's good.

1741
01:23:19.667 --> 01:23:21.333
- Cart. Magna Carta. Hmm.
- [bell dinging]

1742
01:23:21.333 --> 01:23:23.042
- [audience cheering. applauding]
- What's the Magna Carta?

1743
01:23:23.667 --> 01:23:26.125
Sky. Space.

1744
01:23:27.167 --> 01:23:28.333
- Dog.
- [audience laughing]

1745
01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:30.500
- [barks]
- Shut up!

1746
01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:31.708
- [Bart] Stay.
- [barks]

1747
01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:34.125
- Shun.
- [gasps]

1748
01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:35.708
Space. Stay.

1749
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
- Shun. International Space Station.
- [bell dinging]

1750
01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.042
- [audience cheering. applauding]
- How... how's that possible?

1751
01:23:41.792 --> 01:23:43.792
- [Bart] Africa.
-"Africa"?

1752
01:23:44.208 --> 01:23:45.542
- Morocco.
- [gasps]

1753
01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:47.208
- [audience applauding]
- [bell dinging]

1754
01:23:47.208 --> 01:23:48.667
- Kombucha!
- [Bart] Apple cider vinegar.

1755
01:23:48.667 --> 01:23:50.042
- Oh.
- [bell dinging]

1756
01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:54.167
Woman. Thatch. Margaret Thatcher.

1757
01:23:54.167 --> 01:23:56.208
- [bell chiming]
- Hmm.

1758
01:23:56.333 --> 01:23:57.833
[Terry] And that's your time.

1759
01:23:57.833 --> 01:24:01.500
Ron. you got seven correct.
which brings your total

1760
01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:04.542
- to a whopping 61.000.
- [bell dinging]

1761
01:24:04.542 --> 01:24:06.583
- Whoo! Heck yeah. bro. Whoo!
- [Bart] Hmm.

1762
01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:08.750
But one thing stands
between you and victory.

1763
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:11.583
Well. actually two. Anne and Jenny.

1764
01:24:11.583 --> 01:24:13.375
- [Ron] Oh. boy.
