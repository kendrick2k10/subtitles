5
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.100
Nice.

6
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.233
I can't find a spot.

7
00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:56.600
All right. just lean back...

8
00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.033
and I'll help you down. okay?

9
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.100
Okay.

10
00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:01.300
Lower away.

11
00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.433
- All right. lowering.
- All right.

12
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.700
Nice.

13
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.667
Whoo!

14
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.300
All right. all right.

15
00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.033
Good job.

16
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.100
Ugh. it was a little scary
up there.

17
00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:19.633
- Not as easy as it looks.
- No.

18
00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:23.734
All right. Who's next?

19
00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:38.500
- Zoe Best is in the house.
- Harris!

20
00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:40.166
It's nice to see you.
How are you?

21
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.700
Never better.

22
00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:44.367
- What do you think?
- It's wonderful.

23
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.533
I heard the book-signing
was a huge success

24
00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:49.500
Yeah. I couldn't
believe the turnout.

25
00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.166
especially after
that one newspaper

26
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.200
called my photos
"high school yearbook poses."

27
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:55.533
Ahh. forget about
that one review.

28
00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:58.166
Your photos are great
and your book is selling.

29
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.800
Hm. I can do better.

30
00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:03.266
Of course. That's why
I wanted to see you.

31
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.834
I've got an idea
for your next book.

32
00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:07.433
Really?

33
00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:09.300
You've done a great job
documenting Chicago

34
00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:11.233
and the Midwest.

35
00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:13.467
Now I want you
to take on the West.

36
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.066
starting with
Yosemite National Park.

37
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.667
Wow. Yosemite?

38
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.700
I--I've never even been there.

39
00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:20.734
All the better.

40
00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:22.633
You'll bring fresh eyes
to the place.

41
00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:25.233
I want you to reveal Yosemite

42
00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:26.934
like no one else
has ever done.

43
00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:30.667
I like the idea
of focusing on photography.

44
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.200
Nature photos as art.

45
00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:34.500
But here's the thing:

46
00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:36.767
I need everything
in two months.

47
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.367
- Two months?
- This will lead

48
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.300
our fall collection.

49
00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:41.734
Leave that to me.

50
00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:44.300
But I need you
to get started ASAP.

51
00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:47.266
- How many pages?
- A hundred or so photos

52
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.667
with very brief essays
this time.

53
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.133
Okay. As soon as
I get your contract.

54
00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:53.400
It's all right here.

55
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.567
This could be the start
of a whole new line.

56
00:02:57.667 --> 00:02:59.834
Zoe's Best of the West.

57
00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:05.767
Yosemite... then Santa Fe.
Big Sur. the Rockies.

58
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.800
But Harris.

59
00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:10.767
it's impossible to do
any better than Ansel Adams.

60
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.800
He was and always will be
Yosemite's master photographer.

61
00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:17.300
And a national treasure.

62
00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:20.533
But this book will be
your vision of Yosemite.

63
00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:21.934
I know. it's just...

64
00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:24.433
it's a little intimidating

65
00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:26.767
following Ansel Adams'
footsteps.

66
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.133
This will be a breakout book
for you. Zoe.

67
00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:30.533
I really believe it.

68
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.400
Okay!

69
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.767
Awesome.

70
00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:53.000
Hello?

71
00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:54.000
Hello?!

72
00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:55.367
- Zoe?
- Harris!

73
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.500
Just checking to see
if you made it to Yosemite.

74
00:05:57.633 --> 00:06:00.734
Yes. I. uh. got here
a couple hours ago.

75
00:06:00.867 --> 00:06:02.033
The drive was fine.

76
00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:04.867
I love it here already.

77
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.433
Good. good.

78
00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:08.100
Can't wait to see the photos.

79
00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:09.667
Keep me posted.

80
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.633
Will do. Okay. bye!

81
00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:23.400
Man...

82
00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:38.967
- Hi. good morning.
- Good morning!

83
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.333
- My name is Zoe Best.
- Sage Morning Star.

84
00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:43.533
It's my first visit.

85
00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:45.934
and this place is spectacular.

86
00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:46.967
Welcome to Yosemite.

87
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.333
Thanks!

88
00:06:48.467 --> 00:06:49.700
Are you here for a permit?

89
00:06:49.834 --> 00:06:51.000
- A permit?
- Yeah.

90
00:06:51.133 --> 00:06:52.734
for campsites
in the wilderness.

91
00:06:52.867 --> 00:06:54.066
Oh. no. no. no.

92
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.400
I'm working on a book.

93
00:06:55.533 --> 00:06:57.066
My publisher
sent me out here.

94
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.033
- A book on Yosemite?
- That's right.

95
00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:02.100
I'm taking photos
of the park as it is today.

96
00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:04.000
Well. this place is
a photographer's dream.

97
00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:05.967
It really is.

98
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.867
Listen. I was wondering.

99
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.767
Do any of your park rangers
offer guided tours?

100
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.433
Oh yeah. there's
lots of organized hikes

101
00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:13.734
led by rangers.

102
00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:15.433
Well. I think I'm looking
more for a guide.

103
00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:17.066
someone who understands
the ecosystem

104
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.066
and the famous landscapes.

105
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.800
You could hike to most of
the famous vistas from here.

106
00:07:21.934 --> 00:07:24.533
You've got Yosemite Falls.
you've got the valley.

107
00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:25.967
El Capitan from the Meadow.

108
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.734
Hm. That sounds easy enough.

109
00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:29.667
But. hey. the ranger talks
really do help.

110
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.133
I would check it out.

111
00:07:31.266 --> 00:07:32.667
Thank you so much.

112
00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:36.734
Actually. I think
I might know someone

113
00:07:36.867 --> 00:07:38.166
who can help you.

114
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.100
He knows the ecology
better than anyone.

115
00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:41.667
He used to be a climber.

116
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.166
- A climber?
- A rock climber.

117
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.100
But he's sort of. um...
off the grid.

118
00:07:48.233 --> 00:07:49.734
But if you can get
his attention.

119
00:07:49.867 --> 00:07:51.033
he really knows his stuff.

120
00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:52.934
I'm intrigued.
What's his name?

121
00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.000
Jack Hawkins.

122
00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:55.033
He's a naturalist.

123
00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:56.166
A naturalist?

124
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.867
He knows the natural order
of things.

125
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.533
from plants to people.

126
00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.633
My grandfather actually runs
this small little outfitter shop

127
00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:04.934
just outside the park.

128
00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:06.867
He might know
where to find Jack.

129
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.133
Where's the shop?

130
00:08:39.133 --> 00:08:40.233
Hello?

131
00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:42.734
Over here.

132
00:08:49.834 --> 00:08:50.867
There we go.

133
00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.266
You ever seen
a woolly bugger?

134
00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:59.734
No. I think that's my first.

135
00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:02.934
You lookin' for a guide?

136
00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:04.834
As a matter of fact. I am.

137
00:09:04.967 --> 00:09:06.633
Well. you've come
to the right place.

138
00:09:06.767 --> 00:09:08.533
Springtime fishing is great.

139
00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:10.033
but you're gonna
need some help.

140
00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:13.066
Oh! No. I'm--
I'm not here for the fishing.

141
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.633
I'm looking for a guide
named Jack Hawkins?

142
00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:17.767
Are you?

143
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.133
Is he in some kind of trouble?

144
00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:20.600
No. no. no. uh...

145
00:09:20.734 --> 00:09:22.533
your granddaughter.
the park ranger?

146
00:09:22.667 --> 00:09:23.867
- Sage?
- Yeah.

147
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.266
She said that you
might be able

148
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.800
to connect me with Jack.

149
00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:29.233
Hm.

150
00:09:29.367 --> 00:09:30.734
I haven't seen him
in a few weeks.

151
00:09:30.867 --> 00:09:34.000
He pops up.
then disappears.

152
00:09:34.133 --> 00:09:35.200
Huh.

153
00:09:37.033 --> 00:09:39.800
I. uh--the next time I see him.
I'll let him know

154
00:09:39.934 --> 00:09:41.667
you were looking for him.

155
00:09:43.166 --> 00:09:44.300
Thanks.

156
00:09:50.934 --> 00:09:52.400
It's a great shop.

157
00:09:53.867 --> 00:09:56.133
Do you get a lot of climbers
in here?

158
00:09:56.266 --> 00:09:58.300
Oh yeah. all the time.

159
00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:00.266
Hm.

160
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.567
I understand
Jack is a climber.

161
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.900
Climber. guide. carpenter.

162
00:10:05.934 --> 00:10:07.100
Interesting.

163
00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:10.800
Jack's one of these
all-around capable guys.

164
00:10:10.934 --> 00:10:12.567
Does a little bit
of everything.

165
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.100
Do you happen to know
where he lives?

166
00:10:15.233 --> 00:10:17.633
We did a blessing
of his land.

167
00:10:17.767 --> 00:10:18.967
up in the mountains.

168
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.233
A blessing?

169
00:10:21.333 --> 00:10:22.800
I love that.

170
00:10:22.934 --> 00:10:26.867
There's an unmarked road
back towards the park

171
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.867
off Highway 120.

172
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.800
just past Coldwater Springs.

173
00:10:31.934 --> 00:10:33.133
on the left.

174
00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.800
Thanks...

175
00:10:35.934 --> 00:10:37.233
Kosimay Wilson.

176
00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:39.033
Friends call me Kos.

177
00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:40.834
Zoe Best.

178
00:10:40.967 --> 00:10:42.066
It's lovely to meet you.

179
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.734
Zoe. give me your hand.

180
00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:51.667
This will take you there.

181
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.433
Thank you.

182
00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:21.400
Beethoven's Ninth

183
00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:25.367
from Chicago's Orchestra Hall.
June 27th. 2017.

184
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.233
Bravo!

185
00:12:28.367 --> 00:12:29.300
What the--

186
00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:30.900
Bravo!

187
00:12:31.033 --> 00:12:32.300
Stop that!

188
00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:33.533
Okay. okay.

189
00:12:35.133 --> 00:12:36.967
That was really magnificent.

190
00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:40.100
Wait a minute.

191
00:12:40.233 --> 00:12:43.233
First. you ruined my fishing.
and now this?

192
00:12:45.533 --> 00:12:47.400
- That was you?
- Yeah!

193
00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:49.800
I don't know who you are
or what you're doing here.

194
00:12:49.934 --> 00:12:52.433
but now would be
a good time for you to leave.

195
00:12:52.567 --> 00:12:55.200
I'm sorry about the fishing.

196
00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:58.967
but your performance
here today. wow.

197
00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:02.133
Are you Jack Hawkins?

198
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.467
Yes.

199
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.834
I'm Zoe Best. a photojournalist.

200
00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:08.767
Kos said I could find you here.

201
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.800
Kos.

202
00:13:09.934 --> 00:13:11.000
Yeah.

203
00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:12.967
I don't care
what Kos said. okay?

204
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.300
It's time for you to leave.

205
00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:20.200
Okay. I hear you
loud and clear.

206
00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.533
Don't worry.
I'll show myself out.

207
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.200
Good. Bye!

208
00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:29.867
You know. I was there.
by the way.

209
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.100
Orchestra Hall in Chicago.
June 2017.

210
00:13:35.066 --> 00:13:36.166
It was incredible.

211
00:13:43.934 --> 00:13:45.400
You know...

212
00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:48.800
I was there too
at Orchestra Hall.

213
00:13:48.934 --> 00:13:50.834
Best concert ever.

214
00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:52.266
Top ten.

215
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.967
Are you from Chicago?

216
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:56.567
No. I was just there
that weekend for the concert.

217
00:14:01.734 --> 00:14:03.600
What is it that you want?

218
00:14:04.633 --> 00:14:06.200
I'm looking for a guide.

219
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.166
I do coffee table books
based on my photos.

220
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.300
Picture books
for couch potatoes.

221
00:14:14.433 --> 00:14:15.900
Uh. no!

222
00:14:16.033 --> 00:14:17.200
People really like them.

223
00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:18.533
Yeah. armchair adventurers.

224
00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:21.467
My last book
was on small towns.

225
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.467
It sold really well. too.

226
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.367
What do I know?

227
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.467
My next book...

228
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.834
Your next coffee table book.

229
00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:30.800
is on Yosemite.

230
00:14:30.934 --> 00:14:32.567
I wanna capture the history.

231
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.100
John Muir.
how it was discovered.

232
00:14:35.233 --> 00:14:37.400
Art-like photos of everything.

233
00:14:37.533 --> 00:14:39.400
You know. a million photographers

234
00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:40.967
have been here and done that.

235
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.433
Well. I just need help finding
the famous landscapes.

236
00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:45.200
You should buy a map.
they're all on there.

237
00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:47.066
I wanna go off-map.

238
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.367
Finding new
and different images.

239
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.900
This isn't a theme park. okay?

240
00:14:52.033 --> 00:14:54.433
People die when they go
all gung-ho into the mountains.

241
00:14:54.567 --> 00:14:56.467
Well. that's why I need you.

242
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.500
You know the park
and I don't.

243
00:15:00.567 --> 00:15:02.400
Fine. I get it.

244
00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:03.667
You're not into it.

245
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.033
Probably not.

246
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.400
You know what I think?

247
00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:09.000
No. I don't know what you think.

248
00:15:09.133 --> 00:15:12.934
I think that you're naive
and a little dangerous.

249
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.400
But I also think
that you need some help.

250
00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:20.367
How long do you need?

251
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.133
A week. give or take.
just to get the photos.

252
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.100
Okay.

253
00:15:28.233 --> 00:15:29.900
Okay. you'll do it?

254
00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:33.333
I'll do it.
but I have one rule.

255
00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:34.467
Which is?

256
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.367
You do what I say
when I say it.

257
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.333
The mountains are dangerous.

258
00:15:38.467 --> 00:15:40.066
You got yourself a deal.

259
00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.500
We get started tomorrow.

260
00:15:41.633 --> 00:15:43.600
Mm. a week from tomorrow.

261
00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.467
After I take care
of a few things.

262
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.233
No. no. no. no.
I--I have a deadline.

263
00:15:47.367 --> 00:15:48.934
We need to get started now.

264
00:15:49.066 --> 00:15:50.100
Sorry!

265
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.600
This was a giant waste of time.

266
00:15:53.734 --> 00:15:56.500
You know. I'm gonna go
discover Yosemite on my own.

267
00:15:57.533 --> 00:15:58.533
Suit yourself.

268
00:15:58.667 --> 00:16:00.266
Just be careful
where you're going.

269
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.500
Thanks...

270
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.166
for nothing.

271
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.166
- Morning.
- Hey!

272
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.567
- So. did you find a guide?
- Uh. that would be a no.

273
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.700
Jack was tied up?

274
00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:34.400
Jack was insufferable.

275
00:16:34.533 --> 00:16:36.066
Yeah. he can be a little testy.

276
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.433
- A little?
- Well. he's got that

277
00:16:37.567 --> 00:16:39.100
confirmed-bachelor edge.

278
00:16:39.233 --> 00:16:40.633
But he's the best I know.

279
00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:42.033
Too bad it didn't work out.

280
00:16:42.166 --> 00:16:43.467
I did some research last night.

281
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.533
and I'll be just fine
on my own.

282
00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:49.200
You wouldn't happen to have
a map. would you?

283
00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:51.800
Um. a few. Here.

284
00:16:52.834 --> 00:16:54.033
Thanks.

285
00:16:54.166 --> 00:16:55.533
I assume you're starting
with day hikes.

286
00:16:55.667 --> 00:16:57.567
- no overnight permits needed?
- Right.

287
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.367
I'm going to take the trail
to Cascade Falls

288
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.734
and from what I read.

289
00:17:00.867 --> 00:17:02.800
should be a pretty easy hike
on a beautiful day.

290
00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:05.734
Careful--it gets a little
slippery up near the falls.

291
00:17:05.867 --> 00:17:07.333
- Thanks. Sage.
- For sure.

292
00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:08.400
Hello.

293
00:18:06.467 --> 00:18:08.400
Gah! I'm stuck.

294
00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:11.767
Help!

295
00:18:33.033 --> 00:18:34.433
Help!

296
00:18:35.467 --> 00:18:36.767
Help!

297
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.900
Help!

298
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.166
- Whoa there. bear.
- Help!

299
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.567
Go on. bear.

300
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:45.467
Get outta here. go on!

301
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.734
Help!

302
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.000
Help!

303
00:18:51.633 --> 00:18:52.667
Help!

304
00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:57.166
Help!

305
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.700
What are you doing down there?

306
00:19:05.734 --> 00:19:06.900
Jack!

307
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.367
I'm stuck.

308
00:19:13.567 --> 00:19:14.433
All right.

309
00:19:14.567 --> 00:19:16.266
Gimme a minute. all right?

310
00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:30.700
All right. Zoe. I'm gonna
throw the rope down.

311
00:19:30.834 --> 00:19:32.000
Keep clear.

312
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.767
What happened?

313
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.600
My foot is stuck.

314
00:19:53.133 --> 00:19:54.667
All right.

315
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.867
I'm gonna put some chalk on it

316
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.600
and it's gonna come
right out. all right?

317
00:20:06.967 --> 00:20:08.600
- Okay.
- Okay.

318
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.900
- Ready?
- Yeah.

319
00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:11.900
On three.

320
00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:13.867
One. two. three!

321
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.567
Oh!

322
00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:19.767
Thank you.

323
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.500
I thought I was a goner.

324
00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:24.300
You know. that bear was
staring right at me.

325
00:20:24.433 --> 00:20:25.734
Do you have food
in your bag?

326
00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:29.033
I had a protein bar.

327
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.467
You're lucky.
That's all I can say.

328
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.033
Now what?

329
00:20:39.633 --> 00:20:42.000
- Start climbing.
- How?

330
00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:44.700
You go hand over hand
and your feet will just follow.

331
00:20:44.834 --> 00:20:46.333
What if I slip?

332
00:20:46.467 --> 00:20:48.266
If you slip.
I have the rope.

333
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.567
Just reestablish your footing
and keep going.

334
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.834
Okay.

335
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.433
Good. you're doing great.

336
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.033
Don't look down. look up.

337
00:21:04.166 --> 00:21:06.700
Okay. Mr. Grouch.

338
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.834
Great.

339
00:21:14.967 --> 00:21:16.433
All right.
you're doing great.

340
00:21:16.567 --> 00:21:18.000
Keep it up.

341
00:21:21.934 --> 00:21:23.533
Almost there!

342
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.033
Yeah!

343
00:21:33.133 --> 00:21:34.567
- Good job.
- Yes!

344
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.667
Okay.

345
00:21:42.767 --> 00:21:44.533
I made it!

346
00:21:48.834 --> 00:21:50.533
You must think
I'm a real knucklehead.

347
00:21:50.667 --> 00:21:51.967
Yeah. something like that.

348
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.567
Someone said
they wouldn't help me!

349
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.633
Never go into the mountains alone.

350
00:21:55.767 --> 00:21:57.066
Okay.

351
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.767
But you said
you wouldn't take me.

352
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.567
Don't even go there. okay?

353
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.734
You could have died.

354
00:22:01.867 --> 00:22:03.600
Well. I didn't expect
to see a bear.

355
00:22:03.734 --> 00:22:04.667
They live here.

356
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.934
We're the visitors.

357
00:22:06.066 --> 00:22:07.567
Yeah. well. it'd be nice
if they'd let us

358
00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.700
- just roam around.
- Most of the time. they do.

359
00:22:09.834 --> 00:22:12.033
Just don't carry
unsealed food. okay.

360
00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:14.033
especially protein bars.

361
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.600
I'm really. really grateful
you showed up.

362
00:22:17.734 --> 00:22:18.800
Thank Sage.

363
00:22:18.934 --> 00:22:20.066
Sage?

364
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.800
Yeah. You told her you were
hiking to Cascade Falls.

365
00:22:21.934 --> 00:22:24.100
she got to worrying
you might do something stupid.

366
00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:26.100
I don't know how
she got that idea.

367
00:22:30.533 --> 00:22:31.633
You know.

368
00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:33.367
you can stay mad at me.

369
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.100
but we're kinda bonded.
aren't we?

370
00:22:38.567 --> 00:22:39.567
What are you talking about?

371
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.133
Well. you just saved my life.

372
00:22:41.266 --> 00:22:44.100
That's kind of a bonding thing.
don't you think?

373
00:22:51.133 --> 00:22:52.734
Jack.

374
00:22:52.867 --> 00:22:54.467
I'm sorry.

375
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.600
I'm truly grateful.

376
00:22:56.734 --> 00:22:58.900
I don't know what I
would have done without you.

377
00:23:01.266 --> 00:23:03.133
I'll give you five days.

378
00:23:03.266 --> 00:23:04.934
That is it.

379
00:23:05.066 --> 00:23:06.567
You will?

380
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.867
I'll take you
where you need to go.

381
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.233
you'll snap your photos.

382
00:23:09.367 --> 00:23:11.800
you'll head back to Chicago
and never come back again.

383
00:23:11.934 --> 00:23:14.200
Ah! What a charming proposal.

384
00:23:15.233 --> 00:23:17.000
Oh. and one more thing?

385
00:23:18.567 --> 00:23:19.567
Gear.

386
00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:22.867
You can't get where you wanna go
without these.

387
00:23:23.934 --> 00:23:25.533
And this.

388
00:23:25.667 --> 00:23:26.900
Are we expecting rain?

389
00:23:27.033 --> 00:23:28.800
- Just trust me.
- Okay. is this where I go

390
00:23:28.934 --> 00:23:31.000
from being a city girl
to a mountain girl?

391
00:23:32.033 --> 00:23:33.700
Something like that.

392
00:23:35.934 --> 00:23:37.100
There you go.

393
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.567
Here you go.

394
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.166
Changing room. That way.

395
00:24:21.066 --> 00:24:23.667
Kos. looks like
I'm your best customer.

396
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.567
Today. you are my only customer.

397
00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:31.000
Hate to ask. but when...

398
00:24:31.133 --> 00:24:33.934
Tomorrow morning. 6 a.m..
Sage's office.

399
00:24:34.066 --> 00:24:36.700
I'll be there.
all geared up.

400
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.000
Great.

401
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.834
- Hello!
- Hey!

402
00:24:44.967 --> 00:24:47.233
So I heard you had
quite the adventure.

403
00:24:47.367 --> 00:24:48.900
If you hadn't sent Jack.

404
00:24:49.033 --> 00:24:51.533
I can't even think about it.
so... thank you.

405
00:24:51.667 --> 00:24:52.767
You really need
to be careful out there.

406
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.967
Things do happen.

407
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.233
Yeah. and after all that.

408
00:24:55.367 --> 00:24:56.734
he still agreed
to be my guide.

409
00:24:56.867 --> 00:24:58.967
Well. you'll be in good hands.

410
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.333
- Hello. by the way.
- Good morning.

411
00:25:00.467 --> 00:25:02.367
You've met my grandfather. Kosimay.

412
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.000
It's nice to see you again.

413
00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:06.100
Sometimes. Jack asks Kos
for advice.

414
00:25:06.233 --> 00:25:07.967
He knows Yosemite
better than anyone.

415
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.734
I was born here.

416
00:25:09.867 --> 00:25:11.700
My family goes way back.

417
00:25:11.834 --> 00:25:14.133
- Four thousand years.
- Oh! Is that all?

418
00:25:14.266 --> 00:25:15.200
Give or take.

419
00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:16.233
We're part of the Miwok tribe.

420
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.467
- Good morning!
- Morning!

421
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.834
- Hey. Sage. how are you?
- Doing well.

422
00:25:19.967 --> 00:25:21.133
- Nice to see you. Jack.
- Yeah. you too.

423
00:25:21.266 --> 00:25:23.667
Well. if you guys need any help
with your planning.

424
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.033
just let me know.
I'll be over there.

425
00:25:25.166 --> 00:25:26.033
Awesome.

426
00:25:26.166 --> 00:25:27.300
- Thanks.
- Thanks. Sage.

427
00:25:27.433 --> 00:25:29.000
And thank you for stopping by.

428
00:25:29.133 --> 00:25:30.233
He knows every trail.

429
00:25:30.367 --> 00:25:31.900
- Don't you?
- Most.

430
00:25:32.934 --> 00:25:33.834
Here you go.

431
00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:35.166
I wanna make things official.

432
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.667
Five days.

433
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.667
Looks good to me.

434
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.934
Let's get started.

435
00:25:39.066 --> 00:25:41.033
Here's a list of the places
I wanna visit.

436
00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:42.667
The closer I can get.
the better.

437
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.166
Yosemite Falls. El Capitan.
Cathedral Rocks...

438
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.300
No problem.

439
00:25:47.433 --> 00:25:48.633
Yeah. I think we can knock

440
00:25:48.767 --> 00:25:50.166
the first three or four
of these off today.

441
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.166
Really?

442
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.567
That's the good news.

443
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.667
Tenaya Creek.
very hard to predict.

444
00:25:57.133 --> 00:25:59.633
See. right here. easy access.

445
00:25:59.767 --> 00:26:03.233
but shadows. clouds. mists.
who knows?

446
00:26:03.367 --> 00:26:05.800
Well. we can at least try. right?

447
00:26:05.934 --> 00:26:07.900
- What do you think?
- Maybe.

448
00:26:08.033 --> 00:26:09.133
depending on the weather.

449
00:26:10.166 --> 00:26:11.700
I have this idea.

450
00:26:11.834 --> 00:26:13.800
I wanna get a photo
of Half Dome.

451
00:26:13.934 --> 00:26:16.367
one that no one
has ever taken before.

452
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.300
That's only the most
photographed mountain

453
00:26:18.433 --> 00:26:19.767
in the world.

454
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.166
- Even Jack managed a shot.
- Oh.

455
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.734
Half Dome at dawn.

456
00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:27.367
Getting close to Half Dome
can be real hard.

457
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.300
But there's a great view
from Mirror Lake.

458
00:26:31.433 --> 00:26:33.066
That's a great idea. Kos.

459
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.033
You need his blessing
and his wisdom.

460
00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:36.900
- Hm.
- Thank you.

461
00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:39.133
All right.
let's get going.

462
00:26:39.266 --> 00:26:41.100
Did you remember
your rain gear?

463
00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:42.367
You know it.

464
00:27:04.633 --> 00:27:07.300
Wow.

465
00:27:07.433 --> 00:27:09.133
Yosemite Falls.

466
00:27:09.266 --> 00:27:10.667
What a shot.

467
00:27:13.767 --> 00:27:16.100
I'll use my 4x5 camera for this.

468
00:27:16.233 --> 00:27:17.533
It's a wide-angle lens.

469
00:27:17.667 --> 00:27:19.600
Great for landscapes.

470
00:27:25.266 --> 00:27:26.967
This is the shutter control.

471
00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.100
See the bellows?

472
00:27:29.367 --> 00:27:30.934
I love this camera.

473
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.333
Now.

474
00:27:36.066 --> 00:27:37.266
Viewfinder...

475
00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.200
Okay. now focus...

476
00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:42.166
This is incredible.

477
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.166
There it is.

478
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.367
Wow.

479
00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.533
The quintessential
Yosemite photo.

480
00:27:53.533 --> 00:27:56.166
It's almost too easy.

481
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.633
Get your rain gear on.
we'll get a little closer.

482
00:28:03.467 --> 00:28:06.433
I've never seen
anything like it.

483
00:28:06.567 --> 00:28:08.133
All those boulders?

484
00:28:08.266 --> 00:28:09.300
It's called talus.

485
00:28:09.433 --> 00:28:11.333
It's been here since
the last ice age.

486
00:28:11.467 --> 00:28:12.967
They're huge!

487
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.166
You can't see from here.

488
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.700
but there are two more
waterfalls up above.

489
00:28:15.834 --> 00:28:17.667
The falls are terraced?

490
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.533
Yeah.

491
00:28:19.667 --> 00:28:22.066
The noise is overpowering.

492
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.967
The fountain of life.

493
00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.500
Magical.

494
00:28:25.633 --> 00:28:27.100
Huh!

495
00:28:42.633 --> 00:28:44.200
Hey! None of me.

496
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.367
Please?

497
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.633
Nope.

498
00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:50.233
Look. this book isn't just about
nice scenery.

499
00:28:50.367 --> 00:28:52.433
It's about people like you
trying to conserve it.

500
00:28:53.467 --> 00:28:55.000
Later. okay?

501
00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:57.066
Come on. one shot.

502
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.066
I hate posed photos.

503
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.467
So don't pose.

504
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.300
Just jump up there
and look like a guy.

505
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.266
Perfect!

506
00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:31.500
You handle those cameras
pretty well.

507
00:29:31.633 --> 00:29:33.533
Tools of the trade.

508
00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:35.066
So what are you?

509
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.233
A journalist
or a photographer?

510
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.066
I went online.

511
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.567
Oh. you did?

512
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.767
My first love was painting.

513
00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.300
That's why I went
to art school.

514
00:29:46.433 --> 00:29:48.367
but then I realized
that you can't make a living

515
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.734
as a fine artist.

516
00:29:49.867 --> 00:29:51.066
Yeah. not easy.

517
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.533
Yeah. so I took some
photography classes

518
00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:55.166
and I realized
I have an eye for it.

519
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.300
I'm sort of a tech geek.

520
00:29:57.433 --> 00:29:59.066
So no training?

521
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.867
Well. I was in journalism
before I went to art school.

522
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.467
So lemme get this straight.

523
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.500
Your goal is to find
Yosemite's famous locations

524
00:30:07.633 --> 00:30:10.066
and take artsy photos.

525
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.300
I am an artist.

526
00:30:12.433 --> 00:30:15.834
My goal is to find new ways
to capture interesting images.

527
00:30:15.967 --> 00:30:18.166
Hm. Well. I'm a scientist.

528
00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.600
Wait.

529
00:30:19.734 --> 00:30:21.700
I thought you were a musician.
you know.

530
00:30:21.834 --> 00:30:23.734
conducting the orchestra?

531
00:30:24.867 --> 00:30:26.667
Okay. you got me.

532
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.500
Music is my passion.
especially classical.

533
00:30:29.633 --> 00:30:31.233
Don't get me wrong.
I love your art and all.

534
00:30:31.367 --> 00:30:34.200
but your photos just don't tell
the whole story.

535
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:35.567
What do you mean?

536
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.233
I mean. Yosemite's ecology
is changing.

537
00:30:38.367 --> 00:30:41.166
There are conservation issues.
environmental concerns.

538
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.400
Well. I was focused on the art.

539
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.533
Gotcha.

540
00:30:46.667 --> 00:30:49.734
I saw your article
about water conservation.

541
00:30:51.233 --> 00:30:52.734
I Googled you too.

542
00:30:53.767 --> 00:30:55.467
- Huh.
- And I also saw

543
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.166
that you wrote a book
called Conserving the West.

544
00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.300
What's that about?

545
00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:01.800
Sustainability.

546
00:31:01.934 --> 00:31:03.700
Of the park?

547
00:31:03.834 --> 00:31:04.934
Of the West.

548
00:31:05.066 --> 00:31:09.500
Its water. its land.
including Yosemite.

549
00:31:09.633 --> 00:31:11.767
Huh. That's interesting.

550
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.767
The science. you know. conservation.

551
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.533
It's about testing
and measuring. you know?

552
00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:19.300
Data analysis.

553
00:31:19.433 --> 00:31:21.567
Your art. your photos
are beautiful.

554
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.867
but science reveals
what's inside the photo.

555
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.266
Okay. well.
this might surprise you.

556
00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.767
but I'm intrigued by all that.

557
00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.300
Do you ever collaborate.
you know. with other writers?

558
00:31:33.433 --> 00:31:35.233
Not big on collaboration.

559
00:31:35.367 --> 00:31:37.834
Oh. all good.
I don't need your help.

560
00:31:37.967 --> 00:31:39.533
Look. I can get you
to the famous locations.

561
00:31:39.667 --> 00:31:41.433
then you're on your own.

562
00:31:41.567 --> 00:31:43.300
Great. Just how I like it.

563
00:31:43.433 --> 00:31:46.033
So are there any places that
show conservation at work?

564
00:31:47.066 --> 00:31:48.800
Oh. so now you want my help?

565
00:31:48.934 --> 00:31:51.734
Well. only because
you're Mr. Conservation.

566
00:31:52.767 --> 00:31:54.533
Hey.

567
00:31:54.667 --> 00:31:55.800
I can show you
what's happening.

568
00:31:55.934 --> 00:31:57.834
just no collaboration.

569
00:31:57.967 --> 00:31:59.266
I wouldn't think of it!

570
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.934
- Good.
- Mm!

571
00:32:11.667 --> 00:32:13.300
Look at those spires.

572
00:32:13.433 --> 00:32:15.834
It looks like they're
reaching for the heavens.

573
00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:17.867
Cathedral spires.

574
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.800
When John Muir arrived here
in the 1860s

575
00:32:19.934 --> 00:32:21.300
and saw this valley.

576
00:32:21.433 --> 00:32:23.266
it was a full-on
religious experience.

577
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.800
Feel like I'm having one
right now.

578
00:32:24.934 --> 00:32:26.533
"The range of light."

579
00:32:26.667 --> 00:32:28.200
That's what he called
the Sierras.

580
00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:30.600
I mean. being here was like
being in a cathedral.

581
00:32:31.633 --> 00:32:33.300
Every read any John Muir?

582
00:32:33.433 --> 00:32:36.266
I started reading
My First Summer in the Sierras

583
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.934
on the plane.

584
00:32:38.066 --> 00:32:39.500
I love his writing.

585
00:32:39.633 --> 00:32:40.700
He was a scientist.

586
00:32:40.834 --> 00:32:42.467
but he connected man's soul
to nature.

587
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.667
It's where he found God.

588
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.667
Huh.

589
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.567
"The grand show is eternal."

590
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.066
That's how he described Yosemite.

591
00:32:52.367 --> 00:32:53.633
When I was driving
through the tunnel

592
00:32:53.767 --> 00:32:55.266
into the valley.

593
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.633
it was sort of like
a religious experience.

594
00:32:57.767 --> 00:32:59.467
That's a gift.

595
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.367
Like the Garden of Eden.

596
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.500
And our job
is to protect it.

597
00:33:03.533 --> 00:33:05.834
And my job is to capture it.

598
00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:14.633
Nice!

599
00:33:15.967 --> 00:33:17.133
Come on.

600
00:33:17.266 --> 00:33:19.700
There's a great spot for
an artsy photo of El Capitan.

601
00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:29.233
Hey!

602
00:33:29.367 --> 00:33:30.834
Wait up. roadrunner!

603
00:33:30.967 --> 00:33:32.934
We got a schedule to keep.

604
00:33:33.066 --> 00:33:34.066
Hi.

605
00:33:35.533 --> 00:33:37.700
Merced River's at its best
this time of year.

606
00:33:38.734 --> 00:33:39.867
How's the fishing?

607
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.033
I wouldn't know.

608
00:33:41.166 --> 00:33:43.266
Someone's phone
scared them all away.

609
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.533
Oh. yeah. Uh. okay.

610
00:33:51.834 --> 00:33:53.133
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

611
00:33:54.166 --> 00:33:55.767
El Capitan.

612
00:33:57.066 --> 00:33:58.867
How's that?

613
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.200
Right in your own back yard.

614
00:34:02.633 --> 00:34:04.266
Do you ever take it for granted?

615
00:34:05.333 --> 00:34:07.100
I take it all for granite.

616
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:09.533
Really?

617
00:34:10.967 --> 00:34:13.567
Sorry. bad pun. okay?

618
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.734
Look. I get to see new things
every day.

619
00:34:16.867 --> 00:34:19.600
Weather patterns.
changing of the seasons.

620
00:34:19.734 --> 00:34:21.066
- I get it.
- But there's a harmony

621
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.767
to this place.
how it all blends.

622
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.700
It's almost mystical.

623
00:34:25.834 --> 00:34:28.033
The sheer cliff is stunning.

624
00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:29.533
El Cap.

625
00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:31.767
It's like a massive anchor
holding everything in place.

626
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.734
And people climb the face?

627
00:34:33.867 --> 00:34:34.867
Every day.

628
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.000
When I drove by yesterday.

629
00:34:38.133 --> 00:34:40.767
there must have been
50 photographers

630
00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.867
in the Meadow
taking photos.

631
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.467
Yup. All trying to be
Ansel Adams.

632
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.633
none of 'em coming even close.

633
00:34:47.767 --> 00:34:49.467
That's exactly how I feel.

634
00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.900
El Capitan
above the Meadow.

635
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.734
Art?

636
00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:04.000
Art.

637
00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:07.033
Hey. look.

638
00:35:07.166 --> 00:35:08.800
About halfway up.

639
00:35:08.934 --> 00:35:10.266
Oh. I see them!

640
00:35:12.066 --> 00:35:14.133
How do they do that?

641
00:35:14.266 --> 00:35:17.100
Lotta chalk
and strong forearms.

642
00:35:17.233 --> 00:35:18.533
They look like toy figures

643
00:35:18.667 --> 00:35:20.100
against a fake backdrop.

644
00:35:21.133 --> 00:35:22.967
They're very real.

645
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.700
Over 30 people have been killed
trying to summit El Capitan.

646
00:35:26.734 --> 00:35:27.767
Wow.

647
00:35:29.834 --> 00:35:31.400
Sage said you're a climber.

648
00:35:32.934 --> 00:35:34.100
I was.

649
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.233
Have you ever scaled
El Capitan?

650
00:35:39.266 --> 00:35:40.734
Several times.

651
00:35:42.166 --> 00:35:43.734
Insane.

652
00:35:43.867 --> 00:35:45.166
Yeah. it's not for everyone.

653
00:35:46.767 --> 00:35:47.934
Hey.

654
00:35:48.066 --> 00:35:50.066
Do you think I could go
to the basecamp or something?

655
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.834
I would love to take some photos
of the climbers.

656
00:35:54.767 --> 00:35:58.700
Yeah. I'll take you to Camp 4
where they all hang out.

657
00:35:58.834 --> 00:36:01.266
It's a good bit
of social history as well.

658
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:02.834
- Let's do it.
- All right.

659
00:36:12.066 --> 00:36:13.900
So cool.

660
00:36:14.033 --> 00:36:15.600
You know.
in climbing circles.

661
00:36:15.734 --> 00:36:17.934
Camp 4 is Mecca.

662
00:36:18.066 --> 00:36:19.867
It started after World War II.

663
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.800
Some burnt-out soldiers
moved here.

664
00:36:21.934 --> 00:36:23.300
Some became climbers.

665
00:36:23.433 --> 00:36:25.333
others were just hanging out.

666
00:36:25.467 --> 00:36:27.200
What did the park rangers think?

667
00:36:27.333 --> 00:36:29.166
Well. there was tension
for years.

668
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.567
The rangers tried to evict 'em

669
00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.633
but the GIs just wouldn't leave.

670
00:36:33.767 --> 00:36:34.900
What happened?

671
00:36:35.033 --> 00:36:37.667
Well. one year.
the river flooded.

672
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.133
washed away a lot
of the staff cottages.

673
00:36:40.266 --> 00:36:43.333
so the park services built
a dormitory over here.

674
00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:46.767
Suddenly. the park rangers had
a strong presence in Camp 4.

675
00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.100
And the climbers?

676
00:36:48.233 --> 00:36:49.967
Today. it's first come.
first served

677
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.333
for a seven-day permit.

678
00:36:59.066 --> 00:36:59.967
Howdy.

679
00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:01.200
- How's it going?
- Good.

680
00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:02.667
How's the climbing today?

681
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.233
- Splitter.
- Right on.

682
00:37:04.367 --> 00:37:06.233
Either one of you guys
summit El Cap?

683
00:37:06.367 --> 00:37:07.400
I did last summer.

684
00:37:07.533 --> 00:37:08.967
Yeah. me too.

685
00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.300
She went the nose route.

686
00:37:10.433 --> 00:37:11.667
In the rain.

687
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.834
Any ascent of El Cap
is major.

688
00:37:13.967 --> 00:37:15.233
Totally.

689
00:37:15.367 --> 00:37:17.767
Uh. I'm doing
a photo book on Yosemite

690
00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.934
and I'm wondering
if I could grab

691
00:37:19.066 --> 00:37:20.333
a few shots of you two?

692
00:37:20.467 --> 00:37:21.633
- Sure.
- Sure.

693
00:37:21.767 --> 00:37:22.767
Awesome.

694
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.033
Hey. where you from?

695
00:37:24.166 --> 00:37:26.066
- Chicago.
- Me too!

696
00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.133
- No kidding.
- Clark Street.

697
00:37:28.266 --> 00:37:30.000
Lincoln Park.

698
00:37:30.133 --> 00:37:31.066
What's your name?

699
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.400
Uh. Zoe Best.

700
00:37:32.533 --> 00:37:33.767
Ah! I have your book.

701
00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.000
Super good.

702
00:37:35.133 --> 00:37:36.233
You should put us in.

703
00:37:36.367 --> 00:37:38.934

You know. I love
that kind of serendipity.

727
00:38:42.033 --> 00:38:43.934
Let me ask you.
'cause you're a climber.

728
00:38:44.066 --> 00:38:45.033
Why do they do it?

729
00:38:45.166 --> 00:38:47.500
It's just so insane.

730
00:38:47.633 --> 00:38:50.500
Well. there's free climbing
with ropes and harnesses.

731
00:38:50.633 --> 00:38:52.166
That's what I used to do.

732
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.266
It's fun.

733
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.400
And dangerous.

734
00:38:54.533 --> 00:38:56.333
Not if you're cautious
and prepared.

735
00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.400
And some climbers don't use
ropes or anything?

736
00:39:00.533 --> 00:39:02.166
That's free soloing.

737
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.500
I did a little bit of that.

738
00:39:04.567 --> 00:39:06.266
Never again.

739
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.467
Wow.

740
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.500
El Capitan is one
of the most difficult

741
00:39:10.633 --> 00:39:11.967
rock climbs in the world.

742
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.233
but that's what draws people.

743
00:39:14.367 --> 00:39:16.200
I guess it's all about
the challenge.

744
00:39:16.333 --> 00:39:19.800
As for me. I like to keep
my feet on the ground.

745
00:39:19.934 --> 00:39:21.100
Well. come on.

746
00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:23.033
I'll get you to a mountaintop.
no climbing needed.

747
00:39:23.166 --> 00:39:24.967
Oh. sounds like
my kind of mountain.

748
00:39:43.467 --> 00:39:46.300
That's Half Dome
in the distance.

749
00:39:47.333 --> 00:39:49.400
I've run out of superlatives.

750
00:39:50.967 --> 00:39:52.133
Hey. check it out.

751
00:39:55.233 --> 00:39:56.533
Aww.

752
00:40:05.066 --> 00:40:08.200
Aww. I love this photo!

753
00:40:16.667 --> 00:40:19.133
Sometimes.
Mother Nature shows off.

754
00:40:19.266 --> 00:40:21.200
She's putting on quite the show.

755
00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:23.333
You know.

756
00:40:23.467 --> 00:40:25.433
it's hard not to appreciate
the park founders.

757
00:40:25.567 --> 00:40:28.233
I mean. their entire goal
was to preserve and conserve.

758
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.100
I want my photos
to tell that story.

759
00:40:32.233 --> 00:40:35.467
Oh. So they're not just
art for art's sake.

760
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.433
Places like Yosemite.
where nature is protected...

761
00:40:41.567 --> 00:40:44.100
it is a great model
for sustainability.

762
00:40:45.967 --> 00:40:50.266
Landscapes are for observation
and conservation.

763
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.266
Not just beauty.
but what's inside the photo.

764
00:40:54.467 --> 00:40:56.133
Art and science.

765
00:40:57.166 --> 00:40:58.934
If we're good to the land.

766
00:40:59.066 --> 00:41:01.233
then the land will be
good to us.

767
00:41:05.367 --> 00:41:07.567
Oh. I almost forgot.

768
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:10.100
Sage invited us over for dinner.

769
00:41:10.233 --> 00:41:12.600
Well. more you than me. but...

770
00:41:12.734 --> 00:41:14.433
I figure I'll tag along.

771
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.734
A home-cooked meal sounds great.

772
00:41:24.834 --> 00:41:26.400
We're here!

773
00:41:26.533 --> 00:41:27.700
Come on in!

774
00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:32.433
Nice to see you again.

775
00:41:32.567 --> 00:41:33.867
Nice to see you!

776
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.367
I'm so glad
you guys could make it.

777
00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.767
Thanks for having us.

778
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.266
This place looks great.

779
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.633
Staff housing.

780
00:41:39.767 --> 00:41:42.200
You know. those WPA guys really
knew how to build a cabin.

781
00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.900
I love the Craftsman look.

782
00:41:44.033 --> 00:41:45.467
Come on. make yourselves
at home.

783
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.600
Uh. Jack. there's wine
on the table for y'all.

784
00:41:47.734 --> 00:41:49.333
Awesome. Thanks.

785
00:41:49.467 --> 00:41:52.767
Um. so. how was your day?

786
00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.400
Now I know how Alice felt

787
00:41:54.533 --> 00:41:56.633
when she arrived
in Wonderland.

788
00:41:58.367 --> 00:41:59.333
Look at that!

789
00:41:59.467 --> 00:42:01.467
"Moon and Half Dome."

790
00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.967
You know. I've taken
some spectacular shots.

791
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.400
but none of them
are this good.

792
00:42:07.533 --> 00:42:09.567
Ansel Adams was
something special.

793
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.600
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

794
00:42:11.734 --> 00:42:13.967
So. any highlights
from your day?

795
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.700
The whole day was a highlight!

796
00:42:15.834 --> 00:42:18.967
But I loved getting close
to El Capitan.

797
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:22.400
- And Cathedral Rocks.
- Mm. where we met John Muir.

798
00:42:22.533 --> 00:42:24.600
- Jack's muse.

799
00:42:24.734 --> 00:42:26.600
We all follow in his footsteps.

800
00:42:27.633 --> 00:42:29.567
You know.
back in the day.

801
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.400
developers had turned Yosemite
into a tourist trap.

802
00:42:32.533 --> 00:42:34.800
- Really?
- Yeah. it's true.

803
00:42:34.934 --> 00:42:38.433
So John Muir knew he had
to do something about it.

804
00:42:38.567 --> 00:42:41.500
so when Teddy Roosevelt
visited in 1903.

805
00:42:41.633 --> 00:42:44.667
he took him camping
down in Mariposa Grove.

806
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.567
That photo's incredible.

807
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.433
That camping trip
led to the preservation

808
00:42:48.567 --> 00:42:49.767
of Yosemite Valley.

809
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.266
It's true.

810
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.367
No John Muir.

811
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.834
no Yosemite National Park.

812
00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.767
Here's to John Muir.

813
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.066
And to those who were here
before him.

814
00:43:07.633 --> 00:43:09.100
- Aho.
- Aho.

815
00:43:10.533 --> 00:43:12.900
I see that you've added
to your library.

816
00:43:13.934 --> 00:43:15.667
Zoe's Best of the Midwest.

817
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.800
Yeah. I picked it up
at the Ansel Adams Gallery.

818
00:43:18.934 --> 00:43:20.500
I didn't know that.

819
00:43:20.633 --> 00:43:21.767
Thanks. Sage.

820
00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.066
I understand why
you're like focusing

821
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.900
on Yosemite's landscapes.

822
00:43:26.033 --> 00:43:29.000
but most of the photos
in your book are of people.

823
00:43:29.133 --> 00:43:30.600
I want to get beauty shots.

824
00:43:30.734 --> 00:43:33.300
but I also like human stories.

825
00:43:33.433 --> 00:43:36.700
Like. today we ran into climbers
at El Capitan.

826
00:43:36.834 --> 00:43:39.533
I had to restrain her from
getting into a harness herself.

827
00:43:39.667 --> 00:43:42.066
The climbers had great stories.

828
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.000
Maybe your book
can also tell our story.

829
00:43:46.133 --> 00:43:47.300
Absolutely.

830
00:43:47.433 --> 00:43:49.333
It's part of history. right?

831
00:43:49.467 --> 00:43:51.600
I like your Alice in Wonderland analogy.

832
00:43:51.734 --> 00:43:54.367
You know the line
"curiouser and curiouser"?

833
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.066
When you dig below
the surface here.

834
00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.500
it can get a little complicated.

835
00:43:59.533 --> 00:44:00.800
Like?

836
00:44:00.934 --> 00:44:04.100
White people tend to think
they discovered Yosemite.

837
00:44:04.233 --> 00:44:06.400
It was never undiscovered.

838
00:44:06.533 --> 00:44:08.700
My great-grandfather
was born here.

839
00:44:08.834 --> 00:44:11.500
and his father was born here
as well.

840
00:44:11.633 --> 00:44:15.767
The Ahwahnechee
were here all along.

841
00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.633
Ahwahnechee?

842
00:44:17.767 --> 00:44:19.834
The original people
of Yosemite Valley.

843
00:44:19.967 --> 00:44:21.600
Part of the Miwok tribe.

844
00:44:21.734 --> 00:44:23.734
There were hundreds of them
living here. right?

845
00:44:23.867 --> 00:44:26.533
Their cedar huts were scattered
throughout the valley.

846
00:44:26.667 --> 00:44:29.100
One family here.
another family there.

847
00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.834
Plenty of fish and deer
for food.

848
00:44:31.967 --> 00:44:34.100
It was a good place.

849
00:44:34.233 --> 00:44:36.667
Then the miners arrived
during the Gold Rush.

850
00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.967
thought they'd discovered paradise.

851
00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.600
That's when trouble began.

852
00:44:41.734 --> 00:44:46.133
There were a lot of tragedies.
and not just a culture clash.

853
00:44:46.266 --> 00:44:49.000
As I understand it. there was
a bounty on our people.

854
00:44:49.133 --> 00:44:53.867
A vigilante group
called the Mariposa Brigade

855
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.400
led sort of an invasion
of Yosemite.

856
00:44:56.533 --> 00:44:59.900
Many were killed
or forced onto reservations.

857
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.266
That's so sad.

858
00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.133
America's past is not perfect.

859
00:45:06.266 --> 00:45:11.000
It's complicated.
and there is a lot of pain.

860
00:45:11.133 --> 00:45:13.433
but it's all a part
of its story.

861
00:45:13.567 --> 00:45:16.967
Do any Indigenous people
still live in the park?

862
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:20.700
The last were gone by the 1960s.

863
00:45:20.834 --> 00:45:25.600
But their spirit is still here.

864
00:45:26.967 --> 00:45:28.734
They'll never leave.

865
00:45:30.266 --> 00:45:33.533
I want to take photos of some
of the historical places.

866
00:45:33.667 --> 00:45:35.000
There's plenty in the park.

867
00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:38.166
Tenaya Lake and Creek.

868
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.867
The Ahwahnee Hotel
and even Half Dome.

869
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.033
And as they say. a picture's
worth a thousand words.

870
00:45:45.166 --> 00:45:46.967
if it's the right picture.

871
00:45:55.033 --> 00:45:57.500
- Harris.
- I'm looking for John Muir.

872
00:45:57.633 --> 00:45:58.500
Is he around?

873
00:45:58.633 --> 00:46:01.133
- He's everywhere.
- Good. good.

874
00:46:01.266 --> 00:46:04.200
- He's the man. you know.
- So I hear.

875
00:46:04.333 --> 00:46:05.767
You need to dig
into his writing.

876
00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.233
I'm on it.

877
00:46:07.367 --> 00:46:10.600
I'm also digging into
the Native American past.

878
00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:12.967
It's tragic
but it's important.

879
00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.834
I agree.

880
00:46:14.967 --> 00:46:16.200
So it's going well?

881
00:46:16.333 --> 00:46:18.934
This place is spectacular.

882
00:46:19.066 --> 00:46:22.500
I mean. you should see
El Capitan.

883
00:46:22.633 --> 00:46:23.700
Send some photos.

884
00:46:23.834 --> 00:46:27.166
We ran into some climbers
scaling the wall.

885
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.900
It's intense.

886
00:46:29.033 --> 00:46:31.133
- Did you find a guide?
- I did!

887
00:46:31.266 --> 00:46:32.834
Yeah. he's an interesting guy.

888
00:46:32.967 --> 00:46:34.233
Former rock climber.

889
00:46:34.367 --> 00:46:35.500
I think you'd like him.

890
00:46:35.633 --> 00:46:39.734
- He was even quoting John Muir.
- Hm. sounds perfect.

891
00:46:39.867 --> 00:46:41.767
Yeah. he also did some writing.

892
00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.600
Wrote a book called
Conserving the West.

893
00:46:44.734 --> 00:46:47.867
- Hm. I've heard of it.
- And we're just getting started.

894
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.834
I can't wait to see
where it leads.

895
00:46:49.967 --> 00:46:51.867
Don't forget your deadline.

896
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.033
Right.

897
00:46:53.166 --> 00:46:54.767
Right. right.

898
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:56.600
I'm on it.

899
00:47:08.033 --> 00:47:10.000
I'm just imagining
200 years ago

900
00:47:10.133 --> 00:47:12.166
when the Ahwahnechee people
lived here.

901
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.967
They just picked
such a beautiful place.

902
00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:16.367
So peaceful.

903
00:47:18.867 --> 00:47:20.734
Yeah. it's like Sage said.

904
00:47:21.767 --> 00:47:22.734
History can be painful.

905
00:47:22.867 --> 00:47:24.934
but the more we know
about our past

906
00:47:25.066 --> 00:47:26.800
the stronger
our future can be.

907
00:47:26.934 --> 00:47:27.934
- How's this?
- Yeah. that's great.

908
00:47:28.066 --> 00:47:29.700
- Great.
- Perfect.

909
00:47:30.734 --> 00:47:33.867
I went to the gallery today.

910
00:47:35.166 --> 00:47:36.333
A present.

911
00:47:38.033 --> 00:47:41.934
Conserving the West
by Jack Hawkins.

912
00:47:42.967 --> 00:47:44.066
Thank you.

913
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.233
You're welcome.

914
00:47:48.834 --> 00:47:51.066
There's a whole section
on water conservation.

915
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.700
Our most important resource.

916
00:47:56.867 --> 00:47:58.266
Look.

917
00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.367
I know I said
I don't need your help.

918
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.900
but I was wrong.

919
00:48:03.033 --> 00:48:06.734
You know more about Yosemite
than I ever will.

920
00:48:06.867 --> 00:48:09.033
How 'bout you help
co-write the book with me?

921
00:48:11.266 --> 00:48:14.100
Like I said. I'm not big
on collaboration.

922
00:48:14.233 --> 00:48:15.100
I know.

923
00:48:15.233 --> 00:48:16.266
But...

924
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.233
If I were to get involved.

925
00:48:19.367 --> 00:48:22.200
I write as a scientist
and you write as a journalist.

926
00:48:22.333 --> 00:48:23.367
And you're good. too.

927
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.767
Thanks.

928
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.433
But I don't think our styles
would mesh.

929
00:48:29.967 --> 00:48:33.133
How about you write sections
under your name

930
00:48:33.266 --> 00:48:35.133
and I write sections
under my name?

931
00:48:37.033 --> 00:48:38.600
I might go deeper
than you want.

932
00:48:38.734 --> 00:48:39.734
I'll take my chances.

933
00:48:41.233 --> 00:48:42.867
This might work out.

934
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.867
You can highlight conservation

935
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.367
and help me find photos
to go with your points.

936
00:48:51.367 --> 00:48:52.767
Maybe.

937
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.367
I do have one ground rule though.

938
00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.900
Here we go.

939
00:48:58.033 --> 00:48:59.200
I'm in charge.

940
00:48:59.333 --> 00:49:02.233
You do what I say
when I say it.

941
00:49:02.367 --> 00:49:04.200
You're the book boss.
I'm the trail boss.

942
00:49:04.333 --> 00:49:06.133
Even-steven!

943
00:49:06.266 --> 00:49:07.533
Okay. Zoe Best.

944
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.867
You got yourself a partner.

945
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.100
Yes!

946
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.867
Woo!

947
00:49:34.834 --> 00:49:36.767
That shot is incredible.

948
00:49:38.133 --> 00:49:39.800
Do you see that rainbow?

949
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.333
We do what we can.

950
00:49:51.333 --> 00:49:53.433
Jack.

951
00:49:53.567 --> 00:49:55.367
I think this is the best photo
I've ever taken.

952
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.367
Really?

953
00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:00.200
It's pure magic.

954
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.166
Ah.

955
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.133
Is this your
art-at-a-new-level shot

956
00:50:07.266 --> 00:50:08.233
for the cover?

957
00:50:09.266 --> 00:50:11.100
Maybe.

958
00:50:11.233 --> 00:50:14.300
Well. I'm glad for you. seriously.

959
00:50:14.433 --> 00:50:17.233
I've always wanted to know
what's at the end of a rainbow.

960
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.467
Me too.

961
00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.467
Woo!

962
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:31.967
Careful.

963
00:50:33.934 --> 00:50:34.900
Woo!

964
00:50:36.166 --> 00:50:37.033
Whoa!

965
00:50:38.166 --> 00:50:39.033
Careful. Zoe.

966
00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:40.066
- Oh.
- You all right?

967
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.467
- Yeah. sorry.
- It's all right.

968
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.200
Let's just take a break
for a minute. yeah?

969
00:50:43.333 --> 00:50:44.533
- Okay.
- Yeah.

970
00:50:52.367 --> 00:50:54.300
Everybody should have
a guide like you.

971
00:50:55.433 --> 00:50:56.600
You've been awesome.

972
00:50:57.633 --> 00:51:00.934
Well. I bet you say that
to all the boys.

973
00:51:01.066 --> 00:51:04.066
I do. but this time
I actually mean it.

974
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:05.200
Well. I don't love guiding.

975
00:51:05.333 --> 00:51:07.400
but sometimes it works out.

976
00:51:07.533 --> 00:51:09.233
Thanks to your friend Sage.

977
00:51:09.367 --> 00:51:10.567
I'm glad she connected us.

978
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.266
Yeah. you weren't so happy
on that first day.

979
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.133
You were such a grouch.

980
00:51:14.266 --> 00:51:15.500
Yeah. you were invading
my space.

981
00:51:15.633 --> 00:51:16.867
I needed a little help.

982
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:17.900
Yeah. you were pretty lost.

983
00:51:18.033 --> 00:51:19.333
I was lost.

984
00:51:19.467 --> 00:51:21.467
I was hoping that you would
just turn back around

985
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.133
and head back to Chicago.

986
00:51:24.533 --> 00:51:25.500
And now?

987
00:51:26.533 --> 00:51:28.100
And now...

988
00:51:29.433 --> 00:51:33.500
I'm seeing the park
through your eyes. as art.

989
00:51:34.934 --> 00:51:35.934
And I love it.

990
00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:43.000
Sage says that you are
a confirmed bachelor

991
00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:45.000
who lives alone in the woods.

992
00:51:47.233 --> 00:51:48.467
I'm happy.

993
00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:51.000
Okay. so I'm just gonna
ask you this.

994
00:51:51.133 --> 00:51:53.600
Between us and the mountains...

995
00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:59.600
Does it ever get lonely living
there alone all year round?

996
00:52:01.734 --> 00:52:03.433
No.

997
00:52:03.567 --> 00:52:04.967
No. I mean...

998
00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:06.100
It just seems like--

999
00:52:06.233 --> 00:52:08.567
There's plenty going on
even in the winter.

1000
00:52:10.166 --> 00:52:13.266
But no love life up here?

1001
00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.266
If you're trying to make me
a profile in your book.

1002
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.400
let's just stop right there.

1003
00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:18.433
I agreed to write about
Yosemite. not about me.

1004
00:52:18.567 --> 00:52:22.700
No. it's just inquiring minds
want to know.

1005
00:52:24.433 --> 00:52:25.900
Have you ever been in love?

1006
00:52:26.033 --> 00:52:27.100
Are you always this nosey?

1007
00:52:27.233 --> 00:52:28.300
I'm a journalist.

1008
00:52:30.633 --> 00:52:31.500
No.

1009
00:52:31.633 --> 00:52:33.500
You're kidding.

1010
00:52:33.633 --> 00:52:35.367
You asked. I answered.

1011
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.367
And the reason is...

1012
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.500
I don't need a reason.

1013
00:52:41.633 --> 00:52:44.066
So you like living alone?

1014
00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.367
- How 'bout you?
- Me?

1015
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:46.367
Yeah.

1016
00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:53.367
Well. if I'm gonna be honest...
my work is my love.

1017
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.934
Okay. well...

1018
00:52:58.066 --> 00:53:01.967
There was Harley. a sculptor
I met in art school.

1019
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.700
But that didn't work out.

1020
00:53:03.834 --> 00:53:05.266
And then there was Billy.

1021
00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.667
Well. actually.
there were two Billys.

1022
00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.600
but I didn't really love them.

1023
00:53:08.734 --> 00:53:11.266
Look. I guess
I'm just old school.

1024
00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.066
I have a different view
of what love actually is.

1025
00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:19.000
You know how I'm about nature
and weather patterns

1026
00:53:19.133 --> 00:53:20.767
and what each day brings
to Yosemite?

1027
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.667
I do now.

1028
00:53:24.166 --> 00:53:26.066
Well. for me
it's all about the land

1029
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.900
and the details within it.

1030
00:53:28.033 --> 00:53:29.633
And if I ever do fall in love.

1031
00:53:29.767 --> 00:53:31.600
it'll be because
of the little things.

1032
00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.600
Do her eyes sparkle
when she laughs.

1033
00:53:34.734 --> 00:53:38.333
and does her smile
touch my soul?

1034
00:53:38.467 --> 00:53:41.633
What sounds does she make
when she's sleeping?

1035
00:53:41.767 --> 00:53:43.967
And how does she react
to a sunrise

1036
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.567
over a mountain ridge.
or when the Alpine glow

1037
00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:48.967
washes over the face
of Half Dome?

1038
00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.033
What brings her joy. you know.

1039
00:53:51.166 --> 00:53:53.967
and how does she accept sadness?

1040
00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.934
And what does she see
that I don't see?

1041
00:53:56.066 --> 00:53:57.567
When I wake up next to her
in the morning.

1042
00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.500
am I excited to share
a new day with her?

1043
00:54:00.633 --> 00:54:05.633
And is there this unspoken look
between us that says.

1044
00:54:05.767 --> 00:54:08.033
"Yes. the world
is a better place

1045
00:54:08.166 --> 00:54:10.133
because we're in it together."

1046
00:54:12.266 --> 00:54:14.467
It'll be like that. you know.

1047
00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:15.667
The details.

1048
00:54:18.533 --> 00:54:19.667
I guess you never
really thought of it.

1049
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.367
Look.

1050
00:54:25.633 --> 00:54:26.734
The Alpine glow.

1051
00:54:29.233 --> 00:54:30.266
It's beautiful.

1052
00:54:32.166 --> 00:54:33.834
Exactly perfect.

1053
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.500
Look.

1054
00:54:38.633 --> 00:54:39.800
I have an idea
if you're up for it.

1055
00:54:40.834 --> 00:54:42.367
Try me.

1056
00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:44.633
There's this great little
country dive bar

1057
00:54:44.767 --> 00:54:46.700
not too far from here.

1058
00:54:46.834 --> 00:54:49.200
Food's pretty good
and there's live music tonight.

1059
00:54:51.333 --> 00:54:52.500
I'm in.

1060
00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:12.400
So. are you getting
what you need?

1061
00:55:12.533 --> 00:55:16.467
I have a ton of beauty shots
and a lot of stories. but...

1062
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.700
I still need that one photo
that takes it to another level.

1063
00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:22.066
Hmm.

1064
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.200
We're still on art patrol.

1065
00:55:24.233 --> 00:55:25.500
Something like that.

1066
00:55:26.633 --> 00:55:27.734
Mm.

1067
00:55:27.867 --> 00:55:29.500
You sure were right
about the food.

1068
00:55:29.633 --> 00:55:31.166
I'm glad you like it.

1069
00:55:32.567 --> 00:55:34.734
This place is amazing.

1070
00:55:34.867 --> 00:55:37.600
What. no country bars
in Chicago?

1071
00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:39.100
Not like this.

1072
00:55:41.233 --> 00:55:42.400
Grab your partners. ladies.

1073
00:55:42.533 --> 00:55:43.400

For a mountain guy who spends
his winters alone?

1085
00:56:33.433 --> 00:56:34.467
Yeah.

1086
00:56:35.734 --> 00:56:37.233
For that guy.

1087
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.867
You dance pretty well too.

1088
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.567
Hm.

1089
00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:47.533
For a Chicago girl
who doesn't get out much?

1090
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.500
Yeah. for that girl.

The rainbow photo is incredible.

1101
00:57:24.633 --> 00:57:25.500
Thanks.

1102
00:57:25.633 --> 00:57:26.700
I love that one too.

1103
00:57:26.834 --> 00:57:28.800
Zoe. this book's
gonna be spectacular.

1104
00:57:28.934 --> 00:57:30.834
I'm excited.

1105
00:57:30.967 --> 00:57:32.467
Have you found
the structure yet?

1106
00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.467
I mean. the shots look great.
but where's the book heading?

1107
00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:37.700
I'm not sure.

1108
00:57:37.834 --> 00:57:40.266
I'm adding a conservation angle
with Jack

1109
00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:41.700
and I'm building
an emotional arc

1110
00:57:41.834 --> 00:57:44.367
about the people I've met.

1111
00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.367
- I still need that one photo.
- To show off the park.

1112
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.867
To show that I'm an artist.
not just another photographer.

1113
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.300
What about the park
and what it means?

1114
00:57:55.433 --> 00:57:57.734
Don't worry.
it's all about the park.

1115
00:57:57.867 --> 00:58:01.000
I just want an image
that soars.

1116
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.734
Sounds good.

1117
00:58:03.867 --> 00:58:05.300
How's Jack working out?

1118
00:58:05.433 --> 00:58:07.266
Better than
I could have imagined.

1119
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:10.734
He just have all this insight
about the land.

1120
00:58:10.867 --> 00:58:15.567
In fact. I have asked him
to co-write the book with me.

1121
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:16.834
- Really?
- Yeah.

1122
00:58:16.967 --> 00:58:18.734
I think he's perfect.

1123
00:58:18.867 --> 00:58:20.567
Keep those photos comin'.

1124
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.600
I will.

1125
00:58:21.734 --> 00:58:22.667
Bye.

1126
00:58:25.667 --> 00:58:26.667
Yes.

1127
00:58:27.767 --> 00:58:28.867
Back when I was rock climbing.

1128
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.467
I used to come down here
to swim.

1129
00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.667
just to cool off.

1130
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.567
Have you always lived up here
near the park?

1131
00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.934
I've been coming up here
since I was a kid.

1132
00:58:37.066 --> 00:58:40.400
My father taught biology
at Cal State Sacramento.

1133
00:58:40.533 --> 00:58:42.867
We spent our summers here
camping and hiking.

1134
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.834
I caught the climbing bug.

1135
00:58:44.967 --> 00:58:46.567
Your parents let you?

1136
00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:47.734
Not at first.

1137
00:58:47.867 --> 00:58:49.467
I majored in Natural Science
at Berkeley.

1138
00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:51.734
but my father always complained
I was majoring in climbing.

1139
00:58:52.867 --> 00:58:53.900
Sounds like you were.

1140
00:58:54.033 --> 00:58:56.767
Well. I climbed my way
through graduate school.

1141
00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.934
That's when I became interested
in conservation.

1142
00:59:00.133 --> 00:59:01.800
And started writing about it.

1143
00:59:01.934 --> 00:59:03.433
Writing was like climbing.

1144
00:59:03.567 --> 00:59:05.367
Put one step
in front of another

1145
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.533
and then another.

1146
00:59:06.667 --> 00:59:09.100
and pretty soon I had
a best-selling book.

1147
00:59:10.467 --> 00:59:12.767
That's how you got
your mountain cabin.

1148
00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:14.633
Somethin' like that.

1149
00:59:14.767 --> 00:59:15.767
Let's talk about you. though.

1150
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:18.333
and what you're missing.
that photo.

1151
00:59:19.734 --> 00:59:22.533
What about that shot
of the rainbow at the falls?

1152
00:59:22.667 --> 00:59:24.233
I love it. but...

1153
00:59:24.367 --> 00:59:26.633
Mm. doesn't define you
as an artist.

1154
00:59:26.767 --> 00:59:28.433
I need a photo of Half Dome.

1155
00:59:28.567 --> 00:59:31.000
one that no one
has ever gotten before.

1156
00:59:31.133 --> 00:59:33.667
I am really stuck on this one.

1157
00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:35.500
What if we backpack
towards Half Dome?

1158
00:59:36.533 --> 00:59:37.400
Let's do it.

1159
00:59:37.533 --> 00:59:38.400
All right.

1160
00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:39.667
Let's check in with Kos.

1161
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.767
We need some gear
and he may have an idea or two.

1162
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:44.100
- Okay.
- All right.

1163
00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.567
I saw this photo of Half Dome
in your book.

1164
00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.967
It's a beauty.

1165
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:56.467
I got lucky one day.

1166
00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.600
It's nice but there's a million
just like it.

1167
00:59:59.734 --> 01:00:01.567
I think it's a masterpiece.

1168
01:00:02.934 --> 01:00:05.767
Think of all the times
you've seen Half Dome.

1169
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:07.967
Do you ever see anything new?

1170
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.900
I always look for the face.

1171
01:00:10.967 --> 01:00:11.967
The face?

1172
01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.500
A legend has been passed down

1173
01:00:13.633 --> 01:00:15.100
about a woman
named Tis-sa-ack

1174
01:00:15.233 --> 01:00:16.734
who quarreled
with her husband.

1175
01:00:16.867 --> 01:00:18.100
She was very upset.

1176
01:00:18.233 --> 01:00:22.767
so she ran off to the east
and formed a huge mountain.

1177
01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:27.467
But her tears of guilt
forever stained her face.

1178
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.734
You see what happens if you--

1179
01:00:28.867 --> 01:00:30.367
Don't go there. Jack.

1180
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.934
I'm just saying.

1181
01:00:33.066 --> 01:00:35.033
Later. her name got changed
to Half Dome.

1182
01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:36.734
And from a certain angle.

1183
01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:40.667
you can see her face
and the tear stains.

1184
01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.133
But getting that photo.
well. I don't know.

1185
01:00:45.533 --> 01:00:47.066
That's it.

1186
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.934
That's the photo I need to get
of her face.

1187
01:00:51.066 --> 01:00:54.367
The problem is.
Half Dome faces west.

1188
01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.900
Most photos are taken
from the south.

1189
01:00:56.033 --> 01:00:56.967
from the John Muir Trail.

1190
01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.333
- right?
- That's right.

1191
01:00:58.467 --> 01:01:00.700
That's where Jack took
his photo.

1192
01:01:01.767 --> 01:01:03.667
From Nevada Falls.

1193
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.000
Long ago. my grandfather
helped John Muir

1194
01:01:06.133 --> 01:01:08.834
create a different trail
all the way to Half Dome.

1195
01:01:08.967 --> 01:01:10.633
- From the west?
- Right.

1196
01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:13.400
But that trail was closed.

1197
01:01:13.533 --> 01:01:16.066
Yeah. the Park Service
closed that trail

1198
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.600
several years ago
because of a big accident.

1199
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.667
So. that's it. there's no way
for me to take the photo

1200
01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.367
- of her face from the west?
- Not safely.

1201
01:01:27.567 --> 01:01:30.867
What's that saying.
"the better part of valor"?

1202
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.133
So. I guess that's that.

1203
01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:34.467
'Fraid so.

1204
01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.400
The idea hit me
early this morning.

1205
01:01:47.533 --> 01:01:48.834
He called and said
the look on your face

1206
01:01:48.967 --> 01:01:50.600
yesterday hurt his heart.

1207
01:01:51.633 --> 01:01:52.734
Kos.

1208
01:01:54.867 --> 01:01:56.700
Thanks.

1209
01:01:56.834 --> 01:01:58.600
So what's the idea?

1210
01:01:58.734 --> 01:02:02.133
When I was a boy.
my grandfather took me camping

1211
01:02:02.266 --> 01:02:03.934
way up Tenaya Creek.

1212
01:02:04.066 --> 01:02:07.033
That's when he told me
about the old trail.

1213
01:02:07.166 --> 01:02:09.567
- The one that's closed?
- Past that one.

1214
01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.900
It's a long hike.
but we kept going.

1215
01:02:12.033 --> 01:02:14.033
above the creek.
up a little ridge.

1216
01:02:14.166 --> 01:02:15.734
and there it was.

1217
01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.066
The face of Half Dome.

1218
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.433
- Close?
- Close enough to see her tears.

1219
01:02:22.567 --> 01:02:24.633
How was it?
Was it steep?

1220
01:02:24.767 --> 01:02:25.967
Not too bad.

1221
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.500
Jack. what do you say?

1222
01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.700
Can we get a wilderness permit
to camp up there?

1223
01:02:31.834 --> 01:02:33.900
There's campsites
along Tenaya Creek.

1224
01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.834
- There you go.
- Awesome.

1225
01:02:40.567 --> 01:02:41.533
Thank you so much.

1226
01:02:42.567 --> 01:02:43.800
All three of you.

1227
01:02:45.633 --> 01:02:47.567
Well. time's a-tickin'.

1228
01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:49.233
Let's pack up and hit the trail.

1229
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.834
- Bye.
- See ya.

1230
01:02:51.967 --> 01:02:52.834
Bye.

1231
01:02:52.967 --> 01:02:54.166
Be safe.

1232
01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.633
Good luck.

1233
01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.133
What a great view.

1234
01:03:01.166 --> 01:03:02.367
See that canyon over there?

1235
01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.000
Uh-huh.

1236
01:03:05.133 --> 01:03:06.266
That's Tenaya Creek.

1237
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.800
That's where we're headed.

1238
01:03:12.367 --> 01:03:13.600
All right.

1239
01:03:15.934 --> 01:03:19.266
Come on. roadrunner.
let's get to it.

1240
01:03:31.934 --> 01:03:33.200
This looks like our spot
right here.

1241
01:03:34.233 --> 01:03:35.767
Oh.

1242
01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.033
Is this where we're camping?

1243
01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:38.333
Yes. ma'am.

1244
01:03:39.367 --> 01:03:41.100
All right.

1245
01:03:44.233 --> 01:03:46.200
How far is the photo ridge
from here.

1246
01:03:46.333 --> 01:03:48.033
the one that Kos
was talking about?

1247
01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.700
Well. I'm guessing that we take
the trail up as far as we can

1248
01:03:52.834 --> 01:03:55.834
and then. if we're lucky.
we'll find it.

1249
01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:58.800
I'm feelin' lucky.

1250
01:03:58.934 --> 01:04:01.133
Come on. let's find a spot
to pitch our tents.

1251
01:04:03.266 --> 01:04:04.133
Okay.

1252
01:04:14.233 --> 01:04:17.633
Whatever it is you've made.
it smells delicious.

1253
01:04:17.767 --> 01:04:19.667
Pre-cooked chicken alfredo.

1254
01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.767
My fave.

1255
01:04:22.767 --> 01:04:25.667
The thermos right there
has got some Chardonnay in it.

1256
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.667
Would you care to pour us
a couple of glasses?

1257
01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:31.667
What do you think
of our dining room?

1258
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.667
Perfect.

1259
01:04:37.433 --> 01:04:39.233
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

1260
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.567
And Jack. thanks.

1261
01:04:46.433 --> 01:04:48.867
Mm. not bad.

1262
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.767
Did I mention I was serving?

1263
01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.233
You've come
to the right restaurant.

1264
01:04:52.367 --> 01:04:54.066
I heard the chef is amazing.

1265
01:04:55.734 --> 01:04:58.000
So. tomorrow morning
we're gonna find

1266
01:04:58.133 --> 01:05:01.400
the face of a young girl
stained with tears.

1267
01:05:01.533 --> 01:05:04.300
the Holy Grail of photos.

1268
01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:07.033
Do you think Kos will put
my photo in his shop?

1269
01:05:07.166 --> 01:05:08.467
Absolutely.

1270
01:05:10.467 --> 01:05:12.133
So. I was thinking.

1271
01:05:12.266 --> 01:05:14.867
my book is gonna tell
the story of Half Dome.

1272
01:05:16.033 --> 01:05:18.767
But I also want to tell
your story.

1273
01:05:19.967 --> 01:05:21.166
No. I don't think so.

1274
01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:23.867
I mean. I can't stop
thinking about you.

1275
01:05:25.033 --> 01:05:26.600
Your story is amazing.

1276
01:05:26.734 --> 01:05:28.700
And you've been coming here
as a boy

1277
01:05:28.834 --> 01:05:31.934
and becoming a climber
and a conservationist.

1278
01:05:32.066 --> 01:05:34.400
There's a romance
to who you are.

1279
01:05:35.934 --> 01:05:37.066
Well. I have to admit.

1280
01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.166
I've been thinkin'
about you too.

1281
01:05:40.233 --> 01:05:41.800
- You have?
- Yeah.

1282
01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.033
Like what?

1283
01:05:47.133 --> 01:05:49.266
How do you feel
about lemon cookies?

1284
01:05:52.333 --> 01:05:54.166
I thought you'd never ask.

1285
01:05:59.533 --> 01:06:01.834
See this band of stars
right here?

1286
01:06:01.967 --> 01:06:04.033
- Uh-huh.
- That's the Milky Way.

1287
01:06:07.567 --> 01:06:09.367
Oh. and these three stars
in a row right here.

1288
01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:10.934
- you see 'em?
- Yeah.

1289
01:06:11.066 --> 01:06:12.800
That's Orion's belt.

1290
01:06:12.934 --> 01:06:15.033
- Is that the Big Dipper?
- Uh-huh.

1291
01:06:16.133 --> 01:06:18.567
And that's Cassiopeia
just below it.

1292
01:06:21.433 --> 01:06:23.200
- A shooting star!
- Yeah.

1293
01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.867
Jack.

1294
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.333
Huh?

1295
01:06:30.467 --> 01:06:31.633
I love this.

1296
01:06:33.934 --> 01:06:35.967
Me too.

1297
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.900
I wish I could preserve
this moment forever.

1298
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.533
So. what's next?

1299
01:06:46.667 --> 01:06:49.266
I mean. after the face of tears.

1300
01:06:50.667 --> 01:06:52.433
Tomorrow's my last night.

1301
01:06:53.567 --> 01:06:55.133
Back to Chicago.

1302
01:06:57.133 --> 01:06:59.600
I've done so much this week.

1303
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.200
Thanks to you.

1304
01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:05.400
Went by too fast.

1305
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.567
Do you think we'll mesh?

1306
01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.200
No.

1307
01:07:11.333 --> 01:07:14.033
But complement. yeah.

1308
01:07:18.533 --> 01:07:20.633
There is something else.

1309
01:07:24.133 --> 01:07:25.333
There is?

1310
01:07:27.967 --> 01:07:29.100
It's just...

1311
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.700
the other night
when we were dancing...

1312
01:07:34.266 --> 01:07:36.066
I looked into your eyes
and it was like

1313
01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.033
looking into your soul.

1314
01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.934
Never had that feeling before.

1315
01:07:42.233 --> 01:07:44.967
Like knowing
if we're together...

1316
01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:47.900
the world is a better place?

1317
01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:52.000
Yeah. like that.

1318
01:07:59.266 --> 01:08:00.367
Like that.

1319
01:08:13.266 --> 01:08:15.200
We should probably
get some sleep.

1320
01:08:16.233 --> 01:08:17.567
- Big day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1321
01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:18.967
Good idea.

1322
01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.300
- Jack.
- I hear 'em.

1323
01:08:31.433 --> 01:08:32.967
What should we do?

1324
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.433
- Let 'em howl.
- Jack!

1325
01:08:50.767 --> 01:08:52.166
Scram!

1326
01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.500
Get out of here!

1327
01:08:53.633 --> 01:08:54.500
Get. get!

1328
01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:04.133
You know. they live here.
we don't.

1329
01:09:04.266 --> 01:09:05.367
Do you think
they would hurt us?

1330
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.667
No.

1331
01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.767
Just hungry.

1332
01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:09.467
Probably smelled our food.

1333
01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.633
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1334
01:09:13.734 --> 01:09:14.800
Back to bed?

1335
01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.533
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

1336
01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:28.033
- Good.
- It's just coyotes. right?

1337
01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:29.967
Right.

1338
01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.166
I mean. nothing to worry about.

1339
01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.000
Nothing to worry about.

1340
01:09:33.133 --> 01:09:35.266
Okay. good. well.
I'll just. uh...

1341
01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:38.133
snuggle back into my bag.

1342
01:09:38.266 --> 01:09:39.433
- Okay.
- Okay.

1343
01:09:39.567 --> 01:09:41.066
- Jack.
- Yeah?

1344
01:09:42.233 --> 01:09:44.333
Are you gonna be okay?

1345
01:09:44.467 --> 01:09:46.367
Yeah. I'll be fine.

1346
01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.433
Okay.

1347
01:09:50.166 --> 01:09:51.200
Good.

1348
01:09:52.333 --> 01:09:53.834
- Zoe.
- Yeah?

1349
01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.066
Goodnight.

1350
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.266
Goodnight.

1351
01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.033
Good morning.

1352
01:10:28.166 --> 01:10:29.700
Mornin'.

1353
01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:32.166
- How'd you sleep?
- I kept hearing coyotes.

1354
01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.333
- I was lights out.
- Hm.

1355
01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:38.333
You made bacon and eggs?

1356
01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:40.233
How are you not married?

1357
01:10:40.367 --> 01:10:42.333
- Grab a seat.
- Thanks.

1358
01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.233
Ooh. this muffin looks good.

1359
01:10:50.367 --> 01:10:52.000
If only I could find
some coffee.

1360
01:10:52.133 --> 01:10:54.533
Well. ask and you shall receive.

1361
01:10:55.633 --> 01:10:57.066
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1362
01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.300
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1363
01:11:00.834 --> 01:11:02.100
Whew. that's strong.

1364
01:11:02.233 --> 01:11:03.100
Mm.

1365
01:11:03.233 --> 01:11:04.100
Shall we dig in?

1366
01:11:04.233 --> 01:11:05.200
Let's do it.

1367
01:11:13.367 --> 01:11:14.633
We'll grab our stuff
on the way back.

1368
01:11:14.767 --> 01:11:16.066
Okay. thanks.

1369
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.066
Yeah.

1370
01:11:33.367 --> 01:11:36.166
All of this.
this beautiful canyon.

1371
01:11:37.233 --> 01:11:38.533
It's life-affirming.

1372
01:11:40.467 --> 01:11:43.934
You just paraphrased
my favorite John Muir quote.

1373
01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.166
Yeah?

1374
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.400
What's his version?

1375
01:11:47.533 --> 01:11:49.600
"Never again will one faint
by the wayside

1376
01:11:49.734 --> 01:11:52.367
who gains the blessing
of one mountain day.

1377
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:55.367
Whatever his fate.
long life. short life.

1378
01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.667
stormy or calm.
he is forever rich."

1379
01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.600
What a writer.

1380
01:12:02.633 --> 01:12:04.133
I got goosebumps.

1381
01:12:05.166 --> 01:12:07.266
John Muir lives.

1382
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.834
I think you're gonna like this.

1383
01:12:36.834 --> 01:12:37.834
Jack!

1384
01:12:39.533 --> 01:12:40.600
Wow.

1385
01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.600
Worth the walk?

1386
01:12:45.734 --> 01:12:48.100
More like "Full Dome"
than Half Dome.

1387
01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:51.166
This is it.

1388
01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.300
This is the shot
that you've been waiting for.

1389
01:13:08.333 --> 01:13:10.300
It's so immense.

1390
01:13:13.233 --> 01:13:15.300
One of the largest rocks
in the world.

1391
01:13:16.333 --> 01:13:18.700
Look at her face
and her tears.

1392
01:13:18.834 --> 01:13:19.800
Yeah.

1393
01:13:32.166 --> 01:13:33.200
What's wrong?

1394
01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:37.200
See how Half Dome bends
outward toward the left

1395
01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:38.533
near the tears?

1396
01:13:39.767 --> 01:13:40.767
Yeah?

1397
01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.834
That's the shot.

1398
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.400
That's it.

1399
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.567
It's perfect.

1400
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.900
Great shot.

1401
01:14:10.033 --> 01:14:11.300
Thanks.

1402
01:14:17.467 --> 01:14:19.233
Kos was right.

1403
01:14:19.367 --> 01:14:20.767
It was worth the effort.

1404
01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.734
It's quite a shot.

1405
01:14:22.867 --> 01:14:25.166
I'm absolutely wiped out.

1406
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.834
You know. if you're not
feeling up to it tonight.

1407
01:14:26.967 --> 01:14:29.100
- I totally get it.
- It's our last night!

1408
01:14:29.233 --> 01:14:31.700
- No. I just--
- A hot bath and a quick nap's

1409
01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.200
all I need.

1410
01:14:34.734 --> 01:14:36.667
I'll see you on the patio
at seven?

1411
01:14:37.934 --> 01:14:39.333
Perfect.

1412
01:14:39.467 --> 01:14:40.633
- Bye.
- See ya.

1413
01:15:07.867 --> 01:15:09.867
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

1414
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.433
You clean up very well.

1415
01:15:18.033 --> 01:15:19.567
This is really nice.

1416
01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:25.500
So. before I forget.
what's the deadline?

1417
01:15:25.633 --> 01:15:28.633
Uh... photographs
by the end of the week.

1418
01:15:28.767 --> 01:15:30.333
And the essays?

1419
01:15:30.467 --> 01:15:31.900
I hope you're a fast writer.

1420
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:35.133
Get me some photos.
I'll start hammering.

1421
01:15:35.266 --> 01:15:37.900
Okay. I'll send some tonight
and an outline of what I need.

1422
01:15:43.633 --> 01:15:45.667
I really wish
you weren't leaving.

1423
01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.300
Yeah.

1424
01:15:49.734 --> 01:15:51.533
I feel like we just got started.

1425
01:15:53.033 --> 01:15:55.200
You think this will beat
the Chardonnay in a thermos?

1426
01:15:55.333 --> 01:15:57.500
Oh. nothing will ever beat that.

1427
01:15:57.633 --> 01:15:59.967
But it will come close.

1428
01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.633
To Zoe's Best.

1429
01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:04.000
It's been magical.

1430
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.800
You really nailed that photo
of Yosemite Falls.

1431
01:16:15.834 --> 01:16:17.433
Our first day.

1432
01:16:17.567 --> 01:16:19.000
How's that Half Dome shot?

1433
01:16:20.133 --> 01:16:22.000
It's so beautiful.

1434
01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:25.200
Oh. and Harris
loved what you wrote

1435
01:16:25.333 --> 01:16:26.767
for the introduction.

1436
01:16:28.166 --> 01:16:31.934
"This valley. caretaken by
our Native brothers and sisters

1437
01:16:32.066 --> 01:16:33.667
for thousands of years.

1438
01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.900
now preserved forever
and for everyone

1439
01:16:37.033 --> 01:16:39.834
as a magnificent national park."

1440
01:16:39.967 --> 01:16:43.500
And the teaser you wrote
about nature on the move

1441
01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:45.633
and El Capitan.
the Pillar of Power.

1442
01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.166
I love it.

1443
01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.166
Great.

1444
01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:49.800
I mean. this is great.

1445
01:16:49.934 --> 01:16:52.166
So. you like
my first three essays then?

1446
01:16:53.867 --> 01:16:55.767
I loved your intro...

1447
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:58.300
but your essays...

1448
01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.066
there's just so much science.

1449
01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.100
It's a coffee table book.
not a text book.

1450
01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.000
I'm a scientist.

1451
01:17:08.133 --> 01:17:10.934
I mean. we agreed that I would
write the way that I write.

1452
01:17:11.066 --> 01:17:12.633
I know.

1453
01:17:12.767 --> 01:17:14.166
I kn--I know.

1454
01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.166
I'm sorry.

1455
01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:16.166
I can't use your essays.

1456
01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.700
They just don't fit.

1457
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.934
I'm really sorry.

1458
01:17:21.133 --> 01:17:24.266
No. I mean. I get it.

1459
01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.934
You're the book boss. right?

1460
01:17:27.633 --> 01:17:28.700
Look. uh...

1461
01:17:30.633 --> 01:17:32.934
- I'll talk to you later.
- Jack.

1462
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:31.934
- Jack.
- Hey. Zoe.

1463
01:19:32.967 --> 01:19:34.166
I'm so glad you called.

1464
01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:35.834
Yeah. I am sorry.
I've just been--

1465
01:19:35.967 --> 01:19:38.667
Oh. no. no. no. it's okay.

1466
01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:40.033
I'm just happy
to hear your voice.

1467
01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:42.133
I'm really sorry
that my essays didn't work out.

1468
01:19:42.266 --> 01:19:45.400
but I'm sure you can
finish this on your own.

1469
01:19:45.533 --> 01:19:48.133
Oh. but Jack.
I--I was thinking--

1470
01:19:48.266 --> 01:19:49.400
No.

1471
01:19:49.533 --> 01:19:52.000
Zoe. I'm done. uh...

1472
01:19:53.033 --> 01:19:54.333
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

1473
01:19:54.467 --> 01:19:58.266
But. Jack... you did help.

1474
01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.266
You're on every page
of this book.

1475
01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.633
every photo. and I--

1476
01:20:01.767 --> 01:20:03.633
I'm sure it's gonna be great.

1477
01:20:03.767 --> 01:20:05.266
and I've loved spending time
with you.

1478
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.900
but we're in different worlds. Zoe.

1479
01:20:08.033 --> 01:20:10.333
It's time for us to move on.

1480
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:12.533
Goodbye.

1481
01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:14.767
Bye.

1482
01:20:43.266 --> 01:20:46.433
I know. Harris.
but I need more time.

1483
01:20:46.567 --> 01:20:48.266
I'm glad that you like
the photos.

1484
01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.333
but they're not gonna make
any sense without the narrative.

1485
01:20:51.467 --> 01:20:53.266
What happened to Jack?

1486
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.567
We had creative differences.

1487
01:20:56.967 --> 01:20:58.300
I see.

1488
01:20:58.433 --> 01:20:59.567
Okay. okay.

1489
01:21:00.667 --> 01:21:03.000
Look. I'm sorry. but...

1490
01:21:03.133 --> 01:21:04.967
I can only give you
two more days.

1491
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.133
That's it.

1492
01:21:06.266 --> 01:21:07.934
I understand.

1493
01:21:08.066 --> 01:21:09.066
Thanks. Harris.

1494
01:21:21.567 --> 01:21:23.400
- Hello.
- Jack.

1495
01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.200
Uh. what a surprise.

1496
01:21:28.333 --> 01:21:30.567
- Um. come on in.
- Thanks.

1497
01:21:38.066 --> 01:21:39.133
You sounded a little stuck.

1498
01:21:39.266 --> 01:21:41.333
And that bear
keeps staring at me.

1499
01:21:41.467 --> 01:21:44.400
Well. I did some rewriting.
simplified some things.

1500
01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:47.500
There were sections
of your essays I loved.

1501
01:21:48.533 --> 01:21:49.633
We got work to do.

1502
01:21:51.066 --> 01:21:52.867
Do you have a printer?

1503
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:07.467
That's it.

1504
01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:11.367
Finished.

1505
01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.400
I couldn't have done it
without you.

1506
01:22:13.533 --> 01:22:14.900
You're the one
that made it great.

1507
01:22:15.033 --> 01:22:18.066
Oh. so now you like
armchair adventure books.

1508
01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.934
I liked the adventure
of making this one.

1509
01:22:21.066 --> 01:22:22.333
To our adventure.

1510
01:22:22.467 --> 01:22:23.867
Zoe's Best of the West.

1511
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.433
Yosemite.

1512
01:22:32.467 --> 01:22:33.433
Well...

1513
01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:36.133
I gotta catch a flight.

1514
01:22:37.433 --> 01:22:38.900
Back to the mountains?

1515
01:22:40.333 --> 01:22:41.333
Yeah.

1516
01:22:50.233 --> 01:22:51.433
Who am I kidding? I...

1517
01:22:53.266 --> 01:22:56.400
I came back here
because I'm in love with you.

1518
01:22:57.633 --> 01:22:59.934
I'm in love with you too.

1519
01:23:00.133 --> 01:23:01.300
Whatever happens
for the rest of my life.

1520
01:23:01.433 --> 01:23:02.734
I want it to be with you.

1521
01:23:04.233 --> 01:23:05.367
Me too.

1522
01:23:07.166 --> 01:23:08.433
Forever.

1523
01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:09.533
Forever.

1524
01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:22.600
So. your book did well.

1525
01:23:22.734 --> 01:23:24.467
Very.

1526
01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.000
What's next?

1527
01:23:26.133 --> 01:23:28.066
Have you ever been
to the Grand Canyon?

1528
01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:30.066
Your next book.

1529
01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:31.266
Our next book.

1530
01:23:32.667 --> 01:23:34.567
Harris sent me off
with a contract.

1531
01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.433
The Grand Canyon.

1532
01:23:37.567 --> 01:23:39.600
And I also have
another question for you.

1533
01:23:40.633 --> 01:23:42.533
As a journalist?

1534
01:23:42.667 --> 01:23:45.066
As the woman
who's in love with you.

1535
01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.867
Okay.

1536
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.266
Will you marry me?

1537
01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:52.400
Are you always this forward?

1538
01:23:52.533 --> 01:23:54.533
Only with you.

1539
01:23:54.667 --> 01:23:58.600
Yes. I will marry you
in front of these mountains

1540
01:23:58.734 --> 01:24:00.433
and Yosemite Falls.

1541
01:24:02.633 --> 01:24:05.433
Do you. Zoe Best.
take Jack Hawkins

1542
01:24:05.567 --> 01:24:08.000
to be your lawful
wedded husband.

1543
01:24:08.133 --> 01:24:11.467
to love. honor. and cherish
from this day forward?

1544
01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:13.500
I do.

1545
01:24:14.667 --> 01:24:17.467
And do you. Jack Hawkins.
take Zoe Best

1546
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.100
to be your lawful
wedded wife.

1547
01:24:20.233 --> 01:24:23.567
to love. honor. and cherish
from this day forward?

1548
01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:25.000
I do.

1549
01:24:25.133 --> 01:24:28.533
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1550
01:24:29.567 --> 01:24:30.600
You may now kiss the bride.
