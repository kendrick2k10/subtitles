00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.518
Hey. Nate. look.

4
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:26.695
Look. Look to your left.
Your left.

5
00:01:26.738 --> 00:01:29.132
-- Other left.
-- Yeah. other left.

6
00:01:29.176 --> 00:01:30.960
Yeah. that's cornfields.

7
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:34.659
And they go on for miles
and miles and miles.

8
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:41.492
What is that voice?

9
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.945
I'm so sorry for your loss.

10
00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.907
I have two kids myself.
Not twins. but...

11
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.256
Thank you.

12
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.911
Look. I know it's none
of my business.

13
00:03:35.954 --> 00:03:38.609
but this isn't a good deal
for you.

14
00:03:38.653 --> 00:03:42.047
I know Realtors that can get you
a much better price.

15
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.617
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:49.141
Are we going to do this or not?

17
00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:50.839
Or should we go somewhere else?

18
00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:56.279
Okay.

19
00:03:56.323 --> 00:03:58.281
Just sign here.

20
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.812
Where was it that
you're moving again?

21
00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:38.207
Honey?

22
00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:42.777
We can still turn back.

23
00:05:44.822 --> 00:05:46.389
No.

24
00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:55.964
Hey. buddy. wake up.

25
00:05:57.008 --> 00:05:58.575
We're here.

26
00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:03.145
Whoa!

27
00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:04.755
Hey. you can look around.

28
00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:06.757
but I need you
to stay close. okay?

29
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.411
-I need to be able to see you.
-Okay.

30
00:06:08.455 --> 00:06:09.499
All right.

31
00:06:11.632 --> 00:06:14.678
You know. you can watch him
too sometimes.

32
00:06:15.462 --> 00:06:17.202
Yeah.

33
00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:19.596
I never thought
I'd see this again.

34
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.605
I have a good feeling
about this. Rach.

35
00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:31.347
It's going to be
a good year for us.

36
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:34.263
I'm happy if you are.

37
00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:36.396
Don't say that.

38
00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:38.963
I want to make you happy.

39
00:06:39.007 --> 00:06:40.835
Well. that's easy.

40
00:06:40.878 --> 00:06:43.533
If Elliot's happy.
then I'm happy.

41
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:54.762
Elliot?

42
00:06:57.982 --> 00:06:59.593
Elliot?

43
00:07:00.637 --> 00:07:02.204
Elliot.

44
00:07:02.247 --> 00:07:03.423
- Elliot?

45
00:07:05.294 --> 00:07:07.296
-- Elliot?!
-- Elliot!

46
00:07:10.386 --> 00:07:11.996
Mom!

47
00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:15.304
Elliot?

48
00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:17.524
You can't just run off
like that.

49
00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:19.134
Do you hear me?!

50
00:07:19.177 --> 00:07:20.614
Do you see the dangers around?

51
00:07:20.657 --> 00:07:22.659
Mom. you're hurting me.

52
00:07:27.708 --> 00:07:29.710
I'm sorry.

53
00:07:29.753 --> 00:07:31.233
I'm sorry. Mom.

54
00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:34.105
I swear.

55
00:07:35.106 --> 00:07:37.282
You scared me.

56
00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:41.983
What were you doing out here?

57
00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:46.596
I see.

58
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.860
Okay. Well. we'll try
and get it fixed.

59
00:07:49.904 --> 00:07:51.862
I'm sorry. Mom.

60
00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:10.490
Oh. wait!

61
00:08:12.622 --> 00:08:14.058
Here. Here.

62
00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:17.148
- No. Mom. no.
Let's go find my room.

63
00:08:17.192 --> 00:08:19.455
- Okay.
I'll be there in a minute.

64
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:22.806
- Yeah. kitchen.
Everything in the kitchen.

65
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.547
It's written on the boxes.

66
00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:26.157
Yeah. up there.

67
00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:28.203
-No. no. back up.

68
00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:30.684
Everything up the stairs. yeah.
Thanks.

69
00:08:30.727 --> 00:08:32.381
I'll show you.

70
00:09:05.501 --> 00:09:07.851
- Rachel.

71
00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:09.461
What's wrong?

72
00:09:14.466 --> 00:09:18.427
This used to be some sort
of local rectory. so...

73
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.477
Elliot?

74
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:28.698
- Mom. come here.
I'm upstairs.

75
00:09:34.922 --> 00:09:35.966
Where?

76
00:09:37.272 --> 00:09:40.057
- Mom.

77
00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:45.280
Elliot?

78
00:09:50.677 --> 00:09:52.069
Elliot?

79
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.223
Elliot?

80
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.526
Elliot.

81
00:10:59.093 --> 00:11:00.703
You scared me.

82
00:11:00.747 --> 00:11:03.532
You want to give me
a heart attack?

83
00:11:03.575 --> 00:11:06.404
Mom. I want this to be my room.

84
00:11:08.624 --> 00:11:10.495
Oh. Really?

85
00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:11.714
Can I have it?

86
00:11:11.758 --> 00:11:13.585
Ah. okay.

87
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:16.893
Well. why don't we talk to Dad?

88
00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:19.330
-- Yeah. Okay.
-- Yeah. yeah? Okay.

89
00:11:32.169 --> 00:11:34.476
Looks like we have guests.

90
00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:38.785
They left already?

91
00:11:38.828 --> 00:11:42.353
Yeah. Sorry.
It's a long walk home.

92
00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:44.834
But we got invited
to a welcome party.

93
00:11:44.878 --> 00:11:47.054
You'll meet them all there.

94
00:11:47.097 --> 00:11:48.316
Okay.

95
00:11:49.491 --> 00:11:50.971
All right.

96
00:11:51.014 --> 00:11:52.537
You know.
you can change your mind.

97
00:11:52.581 --> 00:11:54.714
You don't have to sleep here.

98
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.416
Well. Dad and Mom are just
down those stairs.

99
00:12:01.459 --> 00:12:02.983
If you want to
come sleep with us.

100
00:12:03.026 --> 00:12:04.636
-Okay.
-- Okay.

101
00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:08.031
Big kiss.

102
00:12:08.075 --> 00:12:10.033
And one for Nathan too.

103
00:12:17.301 --> 00:12:19.608
I love you. little man.

104
00:12:21.218 --> 00:12:22.916
Sweet dreams.

105
00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:26.441
- Mom?

106
00:12:26.484 --> 00:12:32.360
You and Dad. do you love me
as much as you loved Nathan?

107
00:12:36.103 --> 00:12:38.235
Of course we do.

108
00:12:43.545 --> 00:12:47.157
You know that Dad and I.

109
00:12:47.201 --> 00:12:51.901
we really -- we really
just miss Nate right now.

110
00:12:51.945 --> 00:12:54.643
The same way you do.

111
00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:58.647
But you don't ever have to worry
about that.

112
00:13:00.127 --> 00:13:01.215
Okay.

113
00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:07.743
Hey.

114
00:13:10.267 --> 00:13:17.144
Do you know that you can tell me
absolutely anything?

115
00:13:17.187 --> 00:13:19.494
Okay.

116
00:13:19.537 --> 00:13:24.194
Why did we leave Nate there
in the ground?

117
00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:26.022
Oh. sweetheart.

118
00:13:27.719 --> 00:13:29.460
We didn't leave him.

119
00:13:30.505 --> 00:13:33.247
He is always with us.

120
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.684
Always.

121
00:13:35.727 --> 00:13:37.381
Who'd we bury. then?

122
00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:56.226
Elliot.

123
00:13:58.054 --> 00:14:01.579
How do you have this?
Where did you find this?

124
00:14:07.977 --> 00:14:10.066
Can I keep it?

125
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.503
Please?

126
00:14:13.635 --> 00:14:16.029
I'm sure he'd want you
to have it.

127
00:14:16.072 --> 00:14:18.509
You just take good care of it.
Okay?

128
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:23.688
So now he wants a bed
for Nathan.

129
00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:28.432
And I may have
promised him that.

130
00:14:28.476 --> 00:14:31.740
Isn't that exactly what
we were not supposed to do?

131
00:14:32.523 --> 00:14:34.134
What's the point
of even being here

132
00:14:34.177 --> 00:14:35.744
if you're gonna give in to him
right away?

133
00:14:35.787 --> 00:14:38.573
I'm sorry.
What should I have done. then?

134
00:14:38.616 --> 00:14:40.923
Said. "Oh. Elliot. don't dwell
on your brother.

135
00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:43.273
-He's dead"?
-You know I didn't mean that.

136
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.929
But it is what you want.

137
00:14:46.973 --> 00:14:48.713
- No.

138
00:14:48.757 --> 00:14:51.194
What I want is for us
to feel better.

139
00:14:51.238 --> 00:14:52.935
Good night.

140
00:16:04.572 --> 00:16:06.139
Hey.

141
00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:09.794
Hey.

142
00:16:11.057 --> 00:16:12.884
Come here.

143
00:16:12.928 --> 00:16:14.582
Come here.

144
00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:16.149
It's okay.

145
00:16:17.846 --> 00:16:19.152
It's okay.

146
00:16:21.806 --> 00:16:23.852
That dream again?

147
00:16:23.895 --> 00:16:24.984
Mm-hmm.

148
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:31.033
Want to talk about it?

149
00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:35.342
There's nothing new to say.

150
00:16:39.737 --> 00:16:43.045
I'm the only one
who can hear him screaming.

151
00:16:45.656 --> 00:16:48.007
They all think I'm crazy.

152
00:16:49.834 --> 00:16:52.141
Then they try to hold me back.

153
00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:59.670
But I have to see him
for myself.

154
00:17:02.717 --> 00:17:06.199
And then when I finally
get the lid open...

155
00:17:07.678 --> 00:17:09.376
...and see him...

156
00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:13.510
Nathan?

157
00:17:17.775 --> 00:17:19.168
Elliot.

158
00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:24.130
...he's so pale...

159
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:28.917
...so beautiful.

160
00:17:33.052 --> 00:17:36.968
I don't know what I'd do
if I lost him too.

161
00:17:50.547 --> 00:17:52.332
- Wait.

162
00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:53.898
This too.

163
00:18:49.302 --> 00:18:52.174
-- Hurry up!
-- Okay.

164
00:18:54.959 --> 00:18:56.700
-- Let's go!
-- All right.

165
00:18:56.744 --> 00:18:59.399
-- Mom! Dad!
-- I'm coming.

166
00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.231
Yeah. when I was a kid.

167
00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:07.537
my father used to take me
out here.

168
00:19:07.581 --> 00:19:10.714
and he said
that the red handprints

169
00:19:10.758 --> 00:19:15.066
were put there like thousands
and thousands of years ago

170
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.807
by cavemen or something.

171
00:19:16.851 --> 00:19:20.071
And legend has it
that if you put your hand

172
00:19:20.115 --> 00:19:24.075
against one of the handprints
and make a wish.

173
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:26.034
it'll come true.

174
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.477
You said you wanted green.

175
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.696
I've got the blue.

176
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.958
Okay.

177
00:20:21.002 --> 00:20:23.787
Now are you ready for this?

178
00:20:23.831 --> 00:20:28.662
In three. two. one.

179
00:20:28.705 --> 00:20:31.055
Ka-splash!

180
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.322
Oh. no!
All my cars got knocked down.

181
00:20:39.281 --> 00:20:40.804
I like you too.

182
00:20:40.848 --> 00:20:45.200
You are my best friend
in the whole entire world.

183
00:20:48.377 --> 00:20:49.509
-Okay.
-Hey.

184
00:20:49.552 --> 00:20:51.075
I crashed all your cars.

185
00:20:51.119 --> 00:20:54.253
I'll let you have some of them.

186
00:20:54.296 --> 00:20:56.037
Who are you talking to?

187
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.126
Destruction!

188
00:20:58.169 --> 00:20:59.867
- Hey.

189
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.651
Elliot?

190
00:21:02.652 --> 00:21:04.219
Hello?

191
00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.438
One sec.

192
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.335
- Hey.

193
00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:35.642
Rach.

194
00:21:35.685 --> 00:21:40.168
This man is taking care of me
more than my mother. right?

195
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:42.910
It's nice to meet you.

196
00:21:42.953 --> 00:21:45.652
-I'll be back in a minute. okay?
-Okay. Yeah.

197
00:21:57.098 --> 00:21:58.708
You don't like this.

198
00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:03.452
Excuse me?

199
00:22:03.496 --> 00:22:04.932
The party.

200
00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:07.804
I don't either.

201
00:22:07.848 --> 00:22:09.632
Just here to piss everyone off.
really.

202
00:22:12.069 --> 00:22:13.419
I'm Helen.

203
00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:17.074
Rachel.

204
00:22:17.118 --> 00:22:18.380
You speak English?

205
00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:20.295
Yeah.
Most folks around here do.

206
00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:22.993
They just don't want to.

207
00:22:23.037 --> 00:22:24.995
But I'm not from here.

208
00:22:26.954 --> 00:22:29.478
Your husband.
Wow.

209
00:22:29.522 --> 00:22:31.828
He's something else. isn't he?

210
00:22:31.872 --> 00:22:34.527
The pride of the town
with "Tip of the Spear."

211
00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:37.312
Oh. you think people
have read it here?

212
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:41.055
Read it?
They're living it.

213
00:22:42.186 --> 00:22:44.101
Oh.

214
00:22:45.451 --> 00:22:48.105
They don't like me
talking to you.

215
00:22:50.499 --> 00:22:52.458
Have you seen the outside?

216
00:22:52.501 --> 00:22:55.286
It's quite beautiful.

217
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.419
-No.
-Come on.

218
00:22:57.463 --> 00:22:59.247
I don't bite.

219
00:23:07.647 --> 00:23:10.214
My deepest condolences. Rachel.

220
00:23:12.347 --> 00:23:14.915
Such a horrible.
horrible accident.

221
00:23:15.959 --> 00:23:17.700
Yeah.

222
00:23:18.658 --> 00:23:21.443
I didn't want to stay
in that house.

223
00:23:21.487 --> 00:23:23.880
Everything reminded me of him.

224
00:23:25.795 --> 00:23:28.145
Then Anthony always wanted
to come back here

225
00:23:28.189 --> 00:23:32.193
and try to start writing again.
so...

226
00:23:32.236 --> 00:23:35.849
So it wasn't your idea
to move here.

227
00:23:37.807 --> 00:23:42.638
Yeah.
We made the decision together.

228
00:23:42.682 --> 00:23:45.989
And you're a photographer?

229
00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:48.949
Oh.
Well. I used to be.

230
00:23:48.992 --> 00:23:51.560
Oh. Well. maybe I could ask you
to take some.

231
00:23:51.604 --> 00:23:56.652
Oh. I. um -- I don't actually
photograph people.

232
00:23:56.696 --> 00:23:59.046
Uh. just architecture.

233
00:23:59.089 --> 00:24:02.005
Buildings. shapes.
that sort of thing.

234
00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:03.442
Shall we sit?

235
00:24:05.487 --> 00:24:09.709
You know. I-I should probably
get back to my son.

236
00:24:09.752 --> 00:24:10.884
but thank you.

237
00:24:10.927 --> 00:24:12.102
Listen.

238
00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:16.237
I'm not crazy.

239
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.673
Okay?

240
00:24:19.153 --> 00:24:20.894
All the others are.

241
00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:24.767
Please.

242
00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:31.208
Okay.

243
00:24:34.821 --> 00:24:37.911
It doesn't matter.
As long as...

244
00:24:40.348 --> 00:24:42.350
Uh...

245
00:24:42.393 --> 00:24:44.570
Have you seen
where Rachel's gone?

246
00:25:01.587 --> 00:25:04.677
I dreamed about you. Rachel.

247
00:25:10.334 --> 00:25:11.858
About your son.

248
00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.513
Pardon me?

249
00:25:16.123 --> 00:25:18.168
He has made a wish.

250
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.393
And it has been granted.

251
00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:29.919
- Rach?

252
00:25:32.313 --> 00:25:34.010
I must go.

253
00:25:34.054 --> 00:25:37.361
Please take my card.

254
00:25:37.405 --> 00:25:39.320
I hope to see you again.

255
00:25:41.409 --> 00:25:42.802
- Rach?

256
00:25:44.804 --> 00:25:47.110
Hey. There you are.

257
00:25:47.154 --> 00:25:48.329
- Hey.

258
00:25:48.372 --> 00:25:49.591
You were wanted.

259
00:25:49.635 --> 00:25:51.593
Oh. great.

260
00:26:03.126 --> 00:26:05.607
Because your wedding
wasn't held here...

261
00:26:06.782 --> 00:26:09.306
...we're celebrating it now.

262
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.091
What does he mean by that?

263
00:26:12.092 --> 00:26:13.354
What?

264
00:26:13.397 --> 00:26:15.574
It's a ceremonial wedding swing.
Come on.

265
00:26:15.617 --> 00:26:17.532
- I'm not getting on that.
Absolutely not.

266
00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:18.925
No. I'll stay with Elliot.

267
00:26:18.968 --> 00:26:20.404
It's a wedding swing.

268
00:26:20.448 --> 00:26:22.189
Go on. Mom.

269
00:26:25.584 --> 00:26:28.108
Yay. All right.

270
00:26:28.151 --> 00:26:30.632
Okay.
When I say stop. you stop it.

271
00:26:30.676 --> 00:26:33.243
- Of course. They'll look
after Elliot. Don't worry.

272
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:53.873
It's going too high.

273
00:26:53.916 --> 00:26:56.136
Please try and enjoy it.

274
00:26:56.179 --> 00:26:58.225
Just hold on.
It's okay.

275
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.496
Anthony. I don't like this.

276
00:27:08.539 --> 00:27:11.238
It's fine!
It's okay!

277
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:28.472
Nate.

278
00:27:31.737 --> 00:27:33.303
Elliot.

279
00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:36.611
-- It's fine.
-Elliot!

280
00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.482
Elliot's fine.

281
00:27:38.526 --> 00:27:40.093
Elliot!

282
00:27:40.136 --> 00:27:42.225
Where did he go?

283
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:44.053
Elliot!

284
00:27:49.711 --> 00:27:51.060
Elliot!

285
00:27:55.064 --> 00:27:57.458
- Hey.

286
00:27:57.501 --> 00:27:59.895
Rach?

287
00:27:59.939 --> 00:28:02.028
Stop the swing!
Rach?

288
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:03.159
It's okay.

289
00:28:03.203 --> 00:28:05.553
Stop the swing!
Hurry up!

290
00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:38.499
- Mom.
You found me.

291
00:28:38.542 --> 00:28:40.631
- Don't ever run off
like that again.

292
00:28:40.675 --> 00:28:43.243
Promise?

293
00:28:43.286 --> 00:28:46.899
I want to sleep in my own bed.

294
00:28:48.378 --> 00:28:51.120
This is your bed. silly.

295
00:28:52.818 --> 00:28:54.994
Okay.

296
00:28:55.037 --> 00:28:56.517
Good night.

297
00:29:04.438 --> 00:29:06.092
I should have warned you
something like that

298
00:29:06.135 --> 00:29:07.833
might have happened.

299
00:29:07.876 --> 00:29:11.488
These people have just been
waiting for us for so long.

300
00:29:11.532 --> 00:29:14.709
Waiting for you. not us.

301
00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:17.625
I get it.
You're still angry with me.

302
00:29:17.668 --> 00:29:21.237
I'm not angry at you.
I'm angry at us.

303
00:29:21.281 --> 00:29:24.327
I left Elliot
with complete strangers.

304
00:29:40.213 --> 00:29:46.132
Don't you think it's weird
that he won't say where he was?

305
00:29:47.829 --> 00:29:50.049
That's what kids do.

306
00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:52.355
No.

307
00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:55.358
Not Elliot.

308
00:29:55.402 --> 00:29:57.796
At least not before.

309
00:30:04.846 --> 00:30:06.500
What do you mean?

310
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:16.597
Haven't you noticed anything odd
with his behavior

311
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.817
since we've been here?

312
00:30:21.123 --> 00:30:23.734
That woman at the party.

313
00:30:23.778 --> 00:30:26.128
She said something weird
about Elliot.

314
00:30:26.172 --> 00:30:27.477
-Who?
-- The British lady.

315
00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:29.175
The eccentric.

316
00:30:29.218 --> 00:30:31.090
Helen?

317
00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:33.005
-She was there?
-Yeah.

318
00:30:34.397 --> 00:30:38.837
She's just the crackpot in town.
Don't pay any attention to her.

319
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:44.930
Look. Elliot's just processing
a huge change.

320
00:30:44.973 --> 00:30:45.974
We all are.

321
00:30:46.975 --> 00:30:49.891
You and me
just need to stay calm

322
00:30:49.935 --> 00:30:52.198
and not get caught up
in any of his stuff.

323
00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:56.898
What do you mean. "his stuff"?

324
00:30:56.942 --> 00:31:00.119
You know. like Nathan's bed
and things.

325
00:31:00.162 --> 00:31:02.251
That's what makes him feel safe.

326
00:31:02.295 --> 00:31:05.211
Yeah. At some point.
that sort of thing has to end.

327
00:31:09.128 --> 00:31:12.044
Why don't you do something
with him. then?

328
00:31:12.087 --> 00:31:15.569
Take him out.
Do guy things.

329
00:31:15.612 --> 00:31:17.310
Guy things?

330
00:31:17.353 --> 00:31:19.660
Yeah.

331
00:31:19.703 --> 00:31:21.880
I don't know.

332
00:31:21.923 --> 00:31:24.621
He just wants you
to pay him attention.

333
00:31:26.014 --> 00:31:27.929
Okay.

334
00:31:27.973 --> 00:31:29.670
I'll talk to him.

335
00:31:32.064 --> 00:31:34.240
I'll do something with him.

336
00:31:37.243 --> 00:31:38.722
Thank you.

337
00:32:14.454 --> 00:32:16.064
- Stop!

338
00:32:28.729 --> 00:32:30.731
You're too fast!

339
00:32:30.774 --> 00:32:32.907
You're too fast.

340
00:32:33.516 --> 00:32:34.778
Oh!

341
00:32:36.693 --> 00:32:38.086
Mama's tired.

342
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.870
Oh. come on. Mom.

343
00:32:39.914 --> 00:32:41.916
No. Mama's out.
Here.

344
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.092
-One more time?
-Come here. Mnh-mnh.

345
00:32:44.136 --> 00:32:45.441
No. Mom.
Don't.

346
00:32:45.485 --> 00:32:47.835
I can't kiss you anymore?
Come here.

347
00:32:47.878 --> 00:32:49.228
Hey. come here.

348
00:32:51.665 --> 00:32:54.189
You're still my little guy.

349
00:33:14.862 --> 00:33:15.819
Hey. bud.

350
00:33:15.863 --> 00:33:19.388
Dinner is almost ready.

351
00:33:19.432 --> 00:33:21.521
Can you move that stuff?

352
00:33:27.266 --> 00:33:28.528
Elliot.

353
00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:31.879
I know you can hear me.

354
00:34:01.517 --> 00:34:03.432
Why would you draw this?

355
00:34:10.483 --> 00:34:14.095
You don't want to hurt Mommy.
do you?

356
00:34:25.411 --> 00:34:27.674
Don't draw this again.

357
00:34:28.631 --> 00:34:30.329
Okay.

358
00:37:18.671 --> 00:37:22.065
Elliot!
What are you doing?!

359
00:37:30.596 --> 00:37:33.381
Why'd you leave me there?

360
00:37:38.604 --> 00:37:41.128
This is just a dream.

361
00:38:17.077 --> 00:38:18.600
Shh. shh. shh.

362
00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:21.951
Mom. what are you doing?

363
00:38:21.995 --> 00:38:25.390
- I'm just putting you
in your own bed. sweetheart.

364
00:38:27.217 --> 00:38:29.002
Shh. shh. shh.

365
00:38:31.874 --> 00:38:33.006
Elliot.

366
00:38:34.834 --> 00:38:36.009
What's wrong?

367
00:38:36.052 --> 00:38:38.403
I'm not Elliot.

368
00:38:38.446 --> 00:38:40.361
I'm Nathan.

369
00:38:40.405 --> 00:38:42.798
Elliot's gone.

370
00:38:46.498 --> 00:38:49.675
- I didn't imagine it.
That is what he said.

371
00:38:49.718 --> 00:38:51.067
Rachel. don't.

372
00:38:51.111 --> 00:38:52.417
Listen to me.

373
00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.942
I know it sounds nuts.
I think so too.

374
00:38:55.985 --> 00:38:58.423
But Elliot's
in some kind of trouble.

375
00:38:58.466 --> 00:39:01.077
He wouldn't say
something like that otherwise.

376
00:39:02.688 --> 00:39:07.170
Ever since we moved here.
he has not been himself.

377
00:39:08.737 --> 00:39:11.261
And something happened to him
at that party.

378
00:39:11.305 --> 00:39:14.047
Look. none of us
are our normal selves.

379
00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:16.310
He says he's Nathan.

380
00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:18.573
Think about that.

381
00:39:19.966 --> 00:39:23.317
What kind of parents are we
if we do nothing?

382
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.062
- Give them back.
They're mine.

383
00:39:29.105 --> 00:39:31.194
Give them back!

384
00:39:33.893 --> 00:39:35.373
No. they're mine!

385
00:39:35.416 --> 00:39:37.592
Elliot.
these are Nathan's toys.

386
00:39:37.636 --> 00:39:40.160
I'm not Elliot!

387
00:39:40.203 --> 00:39:42.641
Give them back!
They're mine!

388
00:39:42.684 --> 00:39:45.121
You're not Nathan!

389
00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:49.212
He's dead!

390
00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:58.526
Sweetie.

391
00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:00.572
Oh. sweetie.

392
00:40:07.056 --> 00:40:09.276
Hey.

393
00:40:09.319 --> 00:40:11.147
Mommy's sorry.

394
00:40:31.777 --> 00:40:33.866
-- Okay.
-What is he saying?

395
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:37.130
Look. it's complicated.

396
00:40:37.173 --> 00:40:39.132
We need help.

397
00:40:39.175 --> 00:40:40.350
Do you understand me?

398
00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.789
Help.

399
00:40:47.923 --> 00:40:51.405
Your family has endured
a terrible tragedy.

400
00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:53.842
a massive change.

401
00:40:54.582 --> 00:40:59.544
The things you think happened.
they can sound crazy.

402
00:41:00.545 --> 00:41:02.460
But to me...

403
00:41:04.287 --> 00:41:07.508
...they are completely
understandable.

404
00:41:07.552 --> 00:41:12.121
They're a little boy's attempts
to understand what happened

405
00:41:12.165 --> 00:41:15.429
in his own limited way.

406
00:41:15.473 --> 00:41:17.213
No.

407
00:41:17.257 --> 00:41:19.781
No. I'm sorry.
There's something else to it.

408
00:41:19.825 --> 00:41:21.087
If you saw the way --

409
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.959
Elliot is a mirror.

410
00:41:24.917 --> 00:41:28.094
He's a reflection
of your emotions and fears.

411
00:41:28.137 --> 00:41:31.532
Especially yours. Rachel.

412
00:41:31.576 --> 00:41:34.927
He's leaning on you
in this difficult time.

413
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.713
That's why the best thing
you can do for him as a mother

414
00:41:38.757 --> 00:41:42.151
is to be calm.

415
00:41:44.458 --> 00:41:47.896
Do it for yourself.
not just for your son.

416
00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.550
No.

417
00:41:49.594 --> 00:41:51.900
No. no. no. no.

418
00:41:51.944 --> 00:41:53.815
This isn't about me.

419
00:41:55.425 --> 00:42:00.300
I brought Elliot to you because
he thinks he's his dead brother.

420
00:42:01.562 --> 00:42:06.132
And you're asking me to be calm.

421
00:42:10.484 --> 00:42:14.488
I can try to book you
an appointment in the city.

422
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:18.231
But that can take time.

423
00:42:18.274 --> 00:42:19.754
We are not in New York.

424
00:42:19.798 --> 00:42:22.061
No shit.

425
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.196
Come on. Elliot.

426
00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.720
We're going.

427
00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.054
What took you so long?

428
00:42:59.098 --> 00:43:00.490
Sorry.

429
00:43:00.534 --> 00:43:02.623
-I just wanted to talk to --
-Okay. Cool.

430
00:43:02.667 --> 00:43:04.582
Just leave.

431
00:43:57.286 --> 00:43:58.679
Excuse the mess.

432
00:43:58.723 --> 00:44:00.768
-I don't ever really get guests.
-- Oh. no.

433
00:44:00.812 --> 00:44:03.336
My husband was merciless
when it came to tidying.

434
00:44:03.379 --> 00:44:05.338
so I think this might be
my way of rebelling.

435
00:44:05.381 --> 00:44:08.036
Although I always thought I was
quite a neat person. really.

436
00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.257
But as my father always said.

437
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.216
the only thing harder
than finding the truth

438
00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:15.914
is accepting it.

439
00:44:15.957 --> 00:44:18.003
Yes.

440
00:44:18.046 --> 00:44:19.657
Now...

441
00:44:21.093 --> 00:44:23.356
You came here for a reason.

442
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.663
Um...

443
00:44:26.533 --> 00:44:30.972
You said something at the party
about my son.

444
00:44:31.016 --> 00:44:32.800
What did you mean?

445
00:44:43.289 --> 00:44:45.334
Are you religious. Rachel?

446
00:44:47.249 --> 00:44:49.730
I used to be.

447
00:44:49.774 --> 00:44:51.297
- Well. I don't know
if you've noticed.

448
00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.517
but there's no church here.

449
00:44:54.561 --> 00:44:57.738
People have lived here
since the dawn of time.

450
00:44:59.522 --> 00:45:03.657
That's what brought me
and my husband here too.

451
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:06.529
A rich pagan culture.

452
00:45:07.443 --> 00:45:10.664
So rich that whenever anyone
tried to build a church here.

453
00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:12.622
it was burned to the ground.

454
00:45:12.666 --> 00:45:15.103
What does that have to do
with Elliot?

455
00:45:16.191 --> 00:45:19.020
It has everything
to do with Elliot.

456
00:45:22.023 --> 00:45:24.722
Everything here is connected.

457
00:45:26.462 --> 00:45:27.986
Haven't you noticed?

458
00:45:30.162 --> 00:45:34.427
Everything here is round.
circular.

459
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:35.515
Look.

460
00:45:36.603 --> 00:45:38.779
It's exceptional. really.

461
00:45:38.823 --> 00:45:42.000
The fields. the farms.
and their yards.

462
00:45:42.043 --> 00:45:44.306
Even the waterways.

463
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:48.789
They all have perfect
circular forms.

464
00:45:50.573 --> 00:45:53.794
And where do they all lead?

465
00:45:57.493 --> 00:45:59.931
To the sacrificial rock.

466
00:46:01.019 --> 00:46:03.325
You've been there. haven't you?

467
00:46:06.111 --> 00:46:08.504
I don't understand.

468
00:46:09.462 --> 00:46:11.856
Well. I thought you said
you studied architecture.

469
00:46:12.508 --> 00:46:14.815
Haven't you ever come across
old pagan beliefs

470
00:46:14.859 --> 00:46:16.338
about the meaning of circles?

471
00:46:16.382 --> 00:46:20.168
Human imperfection.
spiral of hate?

472
00:46:20.212 --> 00:46:22.170
Infinite swing of the pendulum?

473
00:46:22.823 --> 00:46:25.304
Sacrilege against
the Holy Trinity?

474
00:46:25.957 --> 00:46:27.262
No?

475
00:46:27.959 --> 00:46:32.615
When shapes were handed down
at the dawn of time.

476
00:46:32.659 --> 00:46:34.792
who got the circles?

477
00:46:39.318 --> 00:46:41.059
I meant what I said
at the party.

478
00:46:43.104 --> 00:46:48.544
Your son has made a wish.
and it's been granted.

479
00:46:48.588 --> 00:46:51.547
And that's why you're here.

480
00:46:53.854 --> 00:46:56.770
It's not his dead brother
that comes to him at night.

481
00:46:58.554 --> 00:47:00.513
That is something else
altogether.

482
00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:13.700
The eternal incubus.

483
00:47:13.743 --> 00:47:17.443
Destroyer of all virtues.

484
00:47:17.486 --> 00:47:19.706
We're on his land.

485
00:47:21.708 --> 00:47:24.058
This is where he dwells.

486
00:47:25.364 --> 00:47:27.540
And he wants your son.

487
00:47:28.976 --> 00:47:31.718
And he won't let go
till he's done.

488
00:47:35.765 --> 00:47:36.941
No.

489
00:47:36.984 --> 00:47:40.031
I'm sorry. Helen.

490
00:47:40.074 --> 00:47:42.381
Th-This is not your fault.
It's me.

491
00:47:42.424 --> 00:47:46.254
I sometimes imagine things.
and then they get out of hand.

492
00:47:46.298 --> 00:47:49.344
-I'll leave you now.
-But this is what he wants.

493
00:47:49.997 --> 00:47:52.478
This is what he wants --
disbelief.

494
00:47:52.521 --> 00:47:54.872
So he can spin
his twisted schemes.

495
00:47:54.915 --> 00:47:55.960
I should go now.

496
00:47:56.003 --> 00:47:58.788
We ignore him and he wins.

497
00:47:58.832 --> 00:48:00.747
Thank you. Helen.

498
00:48:02.183 --> 00:48:03.663
He'll come.

499
00:48:03.706 --> 00:48:04.925
He'll come.

500
00:48:04.969 --> 00:48:07.449
And they'll take
your other son too.

501
00:48:21.289 --> 00:48:22.682
Where have you been?

502
00:48:24.423 --> 00:48:26.077
I was lost.

503
00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:28.688
What do you mean. lost?

504
00:48:30.168 --> 00:48:32.910
- Do we need to talk
about this right now?

505
00:48:32.953 --> 00:48:34.215
- Rachel.

506
00:49:25.527 --> 00:49:27.442
Who's there?

507
00:51:25.691 --> 00:51:28.389
It wasn't just a bad dream.

508
00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.786
It was a warning.

509
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:42.708
Helen.

510
00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:45.885
I understand that.

511
00:51:47.713 --> 00:51:49.715
But we're okay.

512
00:51:50.716 --> 00:51:52.109
Really.

513
00:52:02.075 --> 00:52:08.168
Has anyone ever told you
what happened to my husband?

514
00:52:10.953 --> 00:52:14.087
He was the first one

515
00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:19.223
to really understand
what was going on here.

516
00:52:20.746 --> 00:52:22.878
He tried to warn us.

517
00:52:24.793 --> 00:52:27.405
And of course
I didn't believe him.

518
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:32.149
I couldn't.

519
00:52:33.498 --> 00:52:36.065
I just wasn't ready.

520
00:52:38.329 --> 00:52:40.244
And they made him pay.

521
00:52:55.563 --> 00:52:56.912
What happened to him?

522
00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.247
He died the following spring.

523
00:53:29.728 --> 00:53:31.208
What was left of him. anyway.

524
00:53:46.048 --> 00:53:48.834
You see strange dreams.
don't you?

525
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:54.361
These dreams are trying to
tell you something.

526
00:53:54.405 --> 00:53:57.146
No. it's just my mind
playing tricks on me.

527
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:58.235
- No.

528
00:53:59.018 --> 00:54:02.195
Don't let him confuse you.

529
00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:04.719
Trust your mother's instinct.

530
00:54:06.634 --> 00:54:09.855
I just don't know
what's real anymore.

531
00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.553
I know.

532
00:54:13.772 --> 00:54:16.122
It happened to me too.

533
00:54:19.821 --> 00:54:22.084
Please.

534
00:54:22.128 --> 00:54:23.347
I need to know.

535
00:54:25.784 --> 00:54:28.526
What does he want from my son?

536
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.661
Everything.

537
00:54:33.705 --> 00:54:35.315
Rachel?

538
00:54:37.143 --> 00:54:39.232
Rachel. look at me.

539
00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:40.712
We'll get through this.

540
00:54:40.755 --> 00:54:43.105
Elliot won't end up
like my husband.

541
00:54:43.149 --> 00:54:44.368
We're not gonna let that happen.

542
00:54:44.411 --> 00:54:45.978
No.

543
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:47.893
- Well. you'll just have to
trust me. all right?

544
00:54:47.936 --> 00:54:49.547
You do everything that I say.

545
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:51.679
Rach. are you out here?

546
00:55:50.259 --> 00:55:52.261
- Hey.

547
00:55:52.305 --> 00:55:54.307
I've been looking for you.

548
00:55:55.874 --> 00:55:57.832
Why aren't you swinging?

549
00:55:59.573 --> 00:56:02.097
I need someone to push me.

550
00:56:02.141 --> 00:56:04.012
Okay.

551
00:56:04.056 --> 00:56:06.188
I'm gonna give you a push.

552
00:56:06.232 --> 00:56:08.452
Ready?
Hold on tight.

553
00:56:08.495 --> 00:56:10.758
-Thank you. Mommy.

554
00:56:11.803 --> 00:56:14.283
Mom. faster. Faster.

555
00:56:14.327 --> 00:56:15.676
- Okay.

556
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.507
Hold on.

557
00:56:23.902 --> 00:56:26.774
No! Stop taking photos.

558
00:56:26.818 --> 00:56:29.386
Stop it.
I don't want to.

559
00:56:29.429 --> 00:56:30.952
Stop taking photos.

560
00:56:30.996 --> 00:56:32.911
-Okay!
-Stop.

561
00:56:32.954 --> 00:56:34.913
Okay.
Calm down.

562
00:56:34.956 --> 00:56:37.263
What's wrong with you?

563
00:56:37.306 --> 00:56:39.134
Stop it. Mommy.

564
00:56:39.178 --> 00:56:40.832
- Elliot.

565
00:57:01.809 --> 00:57:04.159
Don't say that.

566
00:57:04.203 --> 00:57:05.726
You're being a baby right now.

567
00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:07.119
Dad doesn't love me.

568
00:57:07.162 --> 00:57:09.469
I hate him.
He's stupid.

569
00:57:09.513 --> 00:57:10.818
Don't say that.

570
00:57:10.862 --> 00:57:13.212
Dad just has so much work to do.

571
00:57:13.255 --> 00:57:14.474
He doesn't mean anything by it.

572
00:57:14.518 --> 00:57:16.737
No.
He doesn't like me one bit.

573
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:18.652
That is not true. Elliot.

574
00:57:18.696 --> 00:57:20.959
Dad loves you.
You know that.

575
00:57:21.002 --> 00:57:22.526
Come away from there.

576
00:57:22.569 --> 00:57:25.877
- No. He loves
Nathan more. I know it.

577
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:32.057
Elliot. did Nathan say that
to you?

578
00:57:33.754 --> 00:57:35.277
Elliot.

579
00:57:39.064 --> 00:57:40.718
What is this?

580
00:57:42.415 --> 00:57:44.199
What's this dirt?

581
00:57:48.595 --> 00:57:50.858
Give it back!

582
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:53.426
You dug this up?

583
00:57:53.948 --> 00:57:56.473
- Give me that!
It's mine!

584
00:58:24.196 --> 00:58:27.504
- Rach.
What's that smell?

585
00:58:33.727 --> 00:58:37.426
I was burning the milk cartons.
Sorry.

586
00:58:40.647 --> 00:58:42.257
Can we talk?

587
00:58:45.304 --> 00:58:47.349
Nathan would have liked it here.

588
00:58:53.225 --> 00:58:55.009
Sometimes...

589
00:58:56.010 --> 00:59:01.668
...I find myself thinking
maybe we were punished.

590
00:59:02.495 --> 00:59:04.236
What do you mean?

591
00:59:06.804 --> 00:59:08.283
Well...

592
00:59:09.807 --> 00:59:15.813
We were given such an --
such an easy.

593
00:59:15.856 --> 00:59:20.426
wonderful kid like Elliot

594
00:59:20.469 --> 00:59:23.472
that we had to have Nathan too.

595
00:59:27.955 --> 00:59:30.610
I know it's a terrible thought.

596
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:36.181
But his issues.

597
00:59:36.224 --> 00:59:40.577
Rach. you were the best mother
a kid like him could have.

598
00:59:43.144 --> 00:59:45.538
There were times when I...

599
00:59:50.891 --> 00:59:56.462
...I wished
that he would be gone.

600
01:00:00.901 --> 01:00:03.164
That it'd all end.

601
01:00:10.345 --> 01:00:12.565
And then when it happened...

602
01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:18.179
...there was a part of me...

603
01:00:20.529 --> 01:00:23.576
There was a part of me
that felt relieved.

604
01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.621
Rachel. don't.

605
01:00:29.147 --> 01:00:31.715
I was just so exhausted.

606
01:00:36.502 --> 01:00:37.938
Maybe it was my fault.

607
01:00:37.982 --> 01:00:39.070
Hey.

608
01:00:39.113 --> 01:00:40.593
Hey.

609
01:00:45.685 --> 01:00:47.208
It's okay.

610
01:00:47.992 --> 01:00:49.515
Shh.

611
01:02:33.358 --> 01:02:35.403
- Mom.

612
01:02:37.623 --> 01:02:39.451
Sweetie.

613
01:03:03.431 --> 01:03:04.650
- Mom.

614
01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:08.045
- Elliot.

615
01:03:11.222 --> 01:03:13.050
Come over here.

616
01:03:20.361 --> 01:03:21.667
Elliot.

617
01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:24.191
What's wrong?

618
01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:26.280
Nathan wants to see you.

619
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.459
He won't wake up.

620
01:03:33.113 --> 01:03:34.680
Come with me.

621
01:03:47.388 --> 01:03:51.044
- Don't go. No.
No. don't go.

622
01:03:52.524 --> 01:03:54.091
Don't go.

623
01:04:04.014 --> 01:04:05.493
- Don't.

624
01:04:06.886 --> 01:04:09.758
Elliot.

625
01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:11.151
What's going on?

626
01:04:11.195 --> 01:04:12.849
Nate's waiting.

627
01:04:29.474 --> 01:04:31.780
Just look into the flame.

628
01:04:31.824 --> 01:04:34.000
I'll help you.

629
01:04:34.827 --> 01:04:35.959
Elliot. what is this?

630
01:04:36.002 --> 01:04:37.177
Shh!

631
01:04:37.221 --> 01:04:40.398
Mom. concentrate.

632
01:04:46.273 --> 01:04:47.884
Nate?

633
01:04:49.189 --> 01:04:50.887
Nathan?

634
01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:53.585
Mom's here.

635
01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:04.291
He sees you.

636
01:05:07.164 --> 01:05:10.036
And says you're beautiful.

637
01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.522
Nathan.

638
01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:21.830
He sees me?

639
01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.053
Can I see him?

640
01:05:27.097 --> 01:05:29.012
Take the mirror.

641
01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:32.015
Take it.

642
01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:48.509
- No!

643
01:05:50.468 --> 01:05:55.908
Now look at me in the mirror.

644
01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:00.652
- Elliot.

645
01:06:02.175 --> 01:06:03.350
Shh.

646
01:06:04.221 --> 01:06:05.962
Look.

647
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.030
Mom.

648
01:07:07.936 --> 01:07:09.764
They only want Elliot.

649
01:07:10.722 --> 01:07:14.726
We give him.
and we get Nathan back.

650
01:07:22.386 --> 01:07:24.866
An exchange.

651
01:07:26.738 --> 01:07:27.782
Look.

652
01:07:29.306 --> 01:07:31.351
It's already happened.

653
01:07:36.313 --> 01:07:38.097
He's gone.

654
01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:39.403
Where did he go?

655
01:07:39.446 --> 01:07:40.621
Elliot's gone.

656
01:07:41.405 --> 01:07:43.276
- Elliot.

657
01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.756
Elliot!

658
01:09:03.487 --> 01:09:05.141
-- Good morning.
-Mommy!

659
01:09:05.184 --> 01:09:07.143
- Hi.

660
01:09:07.708 --> 01:09:09.275
I made you some breakfast.

661
01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:11.712
You did. did you?

662
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.585
Thank you.

663
01:09:14.628 --> 01:09:16.413
I'm sorry I slept so late.

664
01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:18.284
It's good.
You've earned it.

665
01:09:18.328 --> 01:09:20.068
I'm gonna help Dad
with the well.

666
01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:24.029
You are. are you?

667
01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:26.466
- What have I gone
and promised this time?

668
01:09:27.946 --> 01:09:29.295
Oh. yeah.

669
01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:31.515
I managed to break the vacuum.

670
01:09:31.558 --> 01:09:33.430
How about we all go into town
and get a new one?

671
01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:34.344
Yeah!

672
01:09:39.653 --> 01:09:42.134
Rach. are you coming?

673
01:09:43.918 --> 01:09:45.224
Yeah.

674
01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:46.834
Sounds good.

675
01:09:58.498 --> 01:10:01.240
I'll be right back.
I've just got to get something.

676
01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:03.503
Uh. okay.

677
01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:25.569
So. did you find anything?

678
01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:28.833
No.

679
01:10:30.791 --> 01:10:32.445
Everything okay?

680
01:10:35.448 --> 01:10:36.623
Yeah.

681
01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:32.288
- Mom?

682
01:11:34.246 --> 01:11:36.074
Are you there?

683
01:11:43.777 --> 01:11:45.475
Mom?

684
01:11:50.088 --> 01:11:52.482
Can I see the photos too?

685
01:12:14.808 --> 01:12:16.332
Mom?

686
01:12:17.202 --> 01:12:19.900
Can I see the photos too?

687
01:12:19.944 --> 01:12:21.206
No.

688
01:12:22.468 --> 01:12:26.037
No.
There was something wrong.

689
01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.388
With the processing.

690
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.613
-I did it.

691
01:12:36.656 --> 01:12:39.398
I took pictures of Elliot to see
if he had the same shadow.

692
01:12:39.442 --> 01:12:41.487
-Look.
-What?

693
01:12:41.531 --> 01:12:43.402
- Here.
Nothing.

694
01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:45.404
Here and here and here.

695
01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:47.275
All of it.
Empty.

696
01:12:47.319 --> 01:12:49.495
-Rachel. there's nobody there.
-Exactly.

697
01:12:49.539 --> 01:12:51.932
That's what I'm trying to say.
You see it too. right?

698
01:12:52.498 --> 01:12:55.066
But you're sure that you --

699
01:12:55.109 --> 01:12:56.459
Yes!
Yes.

700
01:12:56.502 --> 01:12:59.070
He was right there.
I photographed him.

701
01:12:59.113 --> 01:13:01.246
He was right there.
and now he's gone.

702
01:13:01.289 --> 01:13:03.814
And this is how they came out.
See?

703
01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:09.428
And you know they're not fake.

704
01:13:09.472 --> 01:13:11.343
'Cause I thought about that.
too.

705
01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:12.953
Look at this.

706
01:13:13.824 --> 01:13:17.741
You can forge one. maybe.
in that time frame.

707
01:13:17.784 --> 01:13:19.525
But not all of them.

708
01:13:19.569 --> 01:13:20.831
Look.

709
01:13:20.874 --> 01:13:23.137
They're all the same.

710
01:13:28.012 --> 01:13:30.493
Helen. I'm not crazy.

711
01:13:31.624 --> 01:13:33.539
He was there.

712
01:13:35.802 --> 01:13:37.674
It's him.

713
01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:39.850
Isn't it?

714
01:13:40.807 --> 01:13:43.114
You believe me now. don't you?

715
01:13:45.986 --> 01:13:47.771
Yes.

716
01:13:47.814 --> 01:13:49.903
It's mockery.

717
01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:52.123
Nothing more.

718
01:13:53.733 --> 01:13:59.478
With these photos. he's saying.
"I already have your son.

719
01:13:59.522 --> 01:14:02.176
There's nothing you can do
about it."

720
01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:08.269
He wants you to give in
in the face of his power.

721
01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.273
But what do we do?

722
01:14:21.282 --> 01:14:23.676
Take me to your son.

723
01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:44.871
If we hurry. we can make it to
Father Vasily before dawn.

724
01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:47.526
He. if anyone.
will be able to help us

725
01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:51.399
so we can still stop him from
attaching himself to your son.

726
01:14:52.444 --> 01:14:55.969
Anthony said it
had already happened.

727
01:14:56.622 --> 01:14:58.058
In my dream.

728
01:14:58.102 --> 01:14:59.625
No.

729
01:14:59.669 --> 01:15:00.844
No.

730
01:15:00.887 --> 01:15:02.541
No.
That's impossible.

731
01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:03.977
Not this fast.

732
01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:08.808
With my husband. it took years
while the devil worked on him.

733
01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:12.551
Attachment is the very last
stage of possession.

734
01:15:12.595 --> 01:15:18.818
They said something else --
about an exchange.

735
01:15:18.862 --> 01:15:20.733
What could that mean?

736
01:15:24.476 --> 01:15:25.956
What?

737
01:15:26.957 --> 01:15:28.306
What?

738
01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:31.527
Oh. God.

739
01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:40.927
Oh. I have been
so fucking blind.

740
01:15:44.104 --> 01:15:46.106
The twins.

741
01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:47.499
The accident.

742
01:15:48.369 --> 01:15:50.546
Anthony's success.

743
01:15:51.982 --> 01:15:54.114
And the reason why
I haven't been able to feel

744
01:15:54.158 --> 01:15:55.551
your son's presence.

745
01:15:55.594 --> 01:15:58.118
What are you talking about?

746
01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:02.340
It's the resurrection
of the devil.

747
01:16:04.342 --> 01:16:06.953
That's why Nathan had to die.

748
01:16:07.432 --> 01:16:09.565
To become his flesh.

749
01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:15.309
But in order to bring him back.
they need the other twin too.

750
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:23.056
He'll tempt you
to become his new mother.

751
01:16:25.972 --> 01:16:29.280
How do I know you haven't agreed
to that already?

752
01:16:31.543 --> 01:16:34.546
I would never hurt my children.

753
01:16:55.523 --> 01:16:57.090
Anthony?

754
01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:25.379
Elliot. I want you
to meet someone.

755
01:17:25.423 --> 01:17:27.381
Helen. come on in.

756
01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:31.037
Helen. this is Elliot.
Elliot. this is Helen.

757
01:17:37.478 --> 01:17:39.263
- No.

758
01:17:40.394 --> 01:17:41.874
What's the matter?

759
01:17:43.876 --> 01:17:45.748
You're sick.

760
01:17:48.315 --> 01:17:49.969
You're sick.

761
01:17:55.279 --> 01:17:56.715
Helen.

762
01:18:14.907 --> 01:18:16.648
What is this?

763
01:18:18.084 --> 01:18:19.738
It's okay.

764
01:18:19.782 --> 01:18:22.132
These people are here
to help you.

765
01:18:22.175 --> 01:18:24.003
What do you mean?

766
01:18:43.109 --> 01:18:44.458
Don't hurt her!

767
01:18:44.502 --> 01:18:46.199
Anthony!

768
01:18:46.243 --> 01:18:47.940
Anthony!

769
01:18:50.247 --> 01:18:53.032
Anthony!

770
01:19:00.387 --> 01:19:03.651
Anthony!

771
01:19:48.435 --> 01:19:50.524
Shh.

772
01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:56.400
Shh.

773
01:23:06.459 --> 01:23:08.070
Yes.

774
01:25:00.921 --> 01:25:02.749
- Mom.

775
01:25:04.055 --> 01:25:07.319
You have to wake up.

776
01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:16.415
Mom.

777
01:25:26.599 --> 01:25:28.123
Elliot?

778
01:25:32.562 --> 01:25:34.477
Where are you?

779
01:25:38.394 --> 01:25:40.657
- I don't know.
It's hot.

780
01:25:44.530 --> 01:25:46.315
-Elliot.
-- Help me.

781
01:25:47.925 --> 01:25:49.535
Where are you?

782
01:25:49.579 --> 01:25:51.363
Help me.

783
01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:13.907
- No.
Please.

784
01:26:13.951 --> 01:26:15.822
I can't do this.

785
01:26:16.606 --> 01:26:19.522
Anthony. listen to me.

786
01:26:20.262 --> 01:26:22.786
It's too late.

787
01:26:22.829 --> 01:26:25.267
It's been decided.

788
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:26.398
Okay.

789
01:26:26.442 --> 01:26:28.879
She will be fine.

790
01:26:30.489 --> 01:26:32.187
- Elliot.

791
01:26:33.405 --> 01:26:35.059
Elliot.

792
01:26:41.108 --> 01:26:42.632
Elliot.

793
01:26:43.633 --> 01:26:44.851
Oh!

794
01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:57.473
-Elliot.
-Mommy!

795
01:26:57.516 --> 01:26:59.388
They hurt you.

796
01:27:00.693 --> 01:27:02.565
Here. No.
Wait.

797
01:27:05.524 --> 01:27:06.656
Oh. God.

798
01:27:06.699 --> 01:27:08.048
Are you okay?

799
01:27:08.092 --> 01:27:10.181
Okay.
So we have to go now.

800
01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:12.836
But we got to be really.
really quiet.

801
01:27:12.879 --> 01:27:15.360
Like a game of hide-and-seek.

802
01:27:15.404 --> 01:27:18.145
Nathan can help us.

803
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:19.321
No.

804
01:27:19.364 --> 01:27:22.454
You don't listen to him.
Okay?

805
01:27:22.498 --> 01:27:24.456
Look at me.

806
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.241
That is not Nathan.

807
01:27:45.912 --> 01:27:47.740
Okay. Okay.
Let's go.

808
01:27:47.784 --> 01:27:50.003
Let's go.
Go!

809
01:27:57.402 --> 01:27:58.360
Shit.

810
01:28:20.773 --> 01:28:22.775
Rachel!

811
01:28:24.777 --> 01:28:27.389
Rachel!

812
01:28:29.739 --> 01:28:32.307
Rachel!

813
01:28:34.265 --> 01:28:35.745
Elliot!

814
01:28:37.137 --> 01:28:38.835
Elliot!

815
01:28:39.401 --> 01:28:41.098
Where'd you go?

816
01:28:44.493 --> 01:28:45.972
Elliot!

817
01:28:48.671 --> 01:28:50.325
Rachel!

818
01:29:09.082 --> 01:29:10.170
Rachel!

819
01:29:10.214 --> 01:29:12.085
Dad!
Stop!

820
01:29:12.129 --> 01:29:14.044
-Rachel!
-Get off me!

821
01:29:14.087 --> 01:29:16.481
-Dad! Don't hurt her!
-Rachel. calm down!

822
01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:19.310
Rachel!

823
01:29:22.313 --> 01:29:23.532
- No!
Don't hurt her!

824
01:29:23.575 --> 01:29:26.361
Rachel. I don't want to do this!

825
01:29:26.404 --> 01:29:27.971
Do you hear me?

826
01:29:28.014 --> 01:29:30.277
Rachel. I don't want to do this!

827
01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:50.689
Just do it.

828
01:29:52.474 --> 01:29:54.780
I'm too tired
to go on with this.

829
01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:58.088
Just do it!

830
01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.971
Elliot.

831
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.370
- Rachel.

832
01:30:24.723 --> 01:30:26.986
You just don't get it.

833
01:30:29.772 --> 01:30:31.774
You really don't.

834
01:30:38.694 --> 01:30:40.957
There is no twin.

835
01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.657
There's no Elliot!

836
01:30:46.484 --> 01:30:48.573
He's not real.

837
01:30:52.011 --> 01:30:54.579
We lost our only son that day.

838
01:30:58.975 --> 01:31:00.846
And you were right.

839
01:31:02.152 --> 01:31:04.197
I was drinking that night.

840
01:31:05.111 --> 01:31:08.114
Even though I said I wouldn't.
I did.

841
01:31:10.943 --> 01:31:13.032
But I didn't drive.

842
01:31:15.644 --> 01:31:17.254
You did.

843
01:31:21.824 --> 01:31:25.262
You got angry
and said you'd leave me.

844
01:31:25.305 --> 01:31:27.003
You'd had enough.

845
01:31:27.656 --> 01:31:30.876
But I didn't realize
that you took Nathan with you.

846
01:31:40.625 --> 01:31:43.062
You had the accident. Rach.

847
01:31:44.716 --> 01:31:47.632
Don't listen to him!
Let's go!

848
01:31:48.851 --> 01:31:51.244
We lost our only son that day.

849
01:31:53.116 --> 01:31:55.161
-Nathan.
-Shut up!

850
01:32:02.734 --> 01:32:06.738
- You closed yourself
off. denied it. blamed me.

851
01:32:07.565 --> 01:32:09.524
I lost you both.

852
01:32:10.916 --> 01:32:12.962
Don't listen to him!

853
01:32:13.005 --> 01:32:15.051
He's lying!

854
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:17.270
And then. suddenly...

855
01:32:19.795 --> 01:32:21.884
...a miracle.

856
01:32:24.277 --> 01:32:25.452
Elliot.

857
01:32:36.507 --> 01:32:38.596
He just went down.

858
01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:42.600
You invented him. Rachel.

859
01:32:42.644 --> 01:32:46.212
And my only mistake
was to let you imagine him.

860
01:32:46.256 --> 01:32:50.565
But for the first time
in a long while. you were happy.

861
01:32:57.093 --> 01:32:58.485
- In the name
of the Father and the Son

862
01:32:58.529 --> 01:32:59.791
and the Holy Spirit.

863
01:33:00.879 --> 01:33:04.317
Dear Heavenly Father. thank you.

864
01:33:05.884 --> 01:33:08.844
- Elliot became
our reason to live.

865
01:33:08.887 --> 01:33:10.541
He made us a family again.

866
01:33:14.153 --> 01:33:16.329
But we couldn't live like that.

867
01:33:16.895 --> 01:33:20.986
It became harder and harder
to keep our secret.

868
01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:37.089
Everyone said it has to stop.

869
01:33:37.133 --> 01:33:40.092
but they hadn't seen
what I had seen.

870
01:33:40.876 --> 01:33:44.488
Without Elliot. you could have
just as well been dead.

871
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:47.883
That's why I did it.

872
01:33:49.188 --> 01:33:51.190
You miss him. don't you?

873
01:33:58.067 --> 01:33:59.459
Elliot.

874
01:34:04.551 --> 01:34:06.728
They would've taken Elliot
from you.

875
01:34:06.771 --> 01:34:08.643
That's why we had
no other choice.

876
01:34:10.296 --> 01:34:14.910
Elliot. you can't just run off
like that.

877
01:34:14.953 --> 01:34:16.128
Do you hear me?!

878
01:34:16.781 --> 01:34:18.783
Do you see all the dangers
around here?

879
01:34:18.827 --> 01:34:22.918
What saved you would destroy us.

880
01:34:24.136 --> 01:34:26.617
I'm gonna get you!

881
01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:29.402
Day after day. you sank deeper.

882
01:34:29.446 --> 01:34:30.665
-Fuck!

883
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:38.934
Rachel!

884
01:34:39.935 --> 01:34:42.067
I didn't know what to do
at that point.

885
01:34:42.111 --> 01:34:43.329
You're sick.

886
01:34:43.373 --> 01:34:44.853
I was losing you. Rachel.

887
01:34:45.941 --> 01:34:47.420
- Anthony!

888
01:34:47.943 --> 01:34:49.031
Anthony!

889
01:35:08.267 --> 01:35:11.140
I did it all out of love.
Rachel.

890
01:35:14.012 --> 01:35:17.755
Look. All of this will become
clear if you just accept it.

891
01:35:17.799 --> 01:35:20.279
-Don't listen to him!
-It's the only sensible answer.

892
01:35:20.323 --> 01:35:21.541
He's lying!

893
01:35:21.585 --> 01:35:23.108
You know the truth.

894
01:35:23.152 --> 01:35:24.849
I'm right here!

895
01:35:24.893 --> 01:35:27.417
No devil. no possession.

896
01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:29.375
Just clarity.

897
01:35:29.419 --> 01:35:30.855
Shut up!

898
01:35:35.555 --> 01:35:36.774
Mom!

899
01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:44.521
It's okay. honey.

900
01:35:46.697 --> 01:35:48.177
It's okay.
Let it come.

901
01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.700
Let it come.

902
01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:53.878
You can see it now.
I know you can see it.

903
01:35:54.618 --> 01:35:55.750
The truth.

904
01:36:28.826 --> 01:36:31.394
Mom. they're gonna kill me!

905
01:37:07.473 --> 01:37:09.127
Elliot!

906
01:37:48.514 --> 01:37:50.212
Elliot!

907
01:37:53.998 --> 01:37:56.522
Hey.
Sweetheart.

908
01:37:56.958 --> 01:37:59.438
You don't believe me anymore.

909
01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:01.919
Oh. darling.

910
01:38:01.963 --> 01:38:04.791
Come here.
Hey.

911
01:38:08.099 --> 01:38:10.362
Of course I believe you.

912
01:38:12.451 --> 01:38:14.105
Hey.
Look at me.

913
01:38:15.454 --> 01:38:17.500
You're my son.

914
01:38:18.370 --> 01:38:20.372
And I love you.

915
01:38:21.504 --> 01:38:23.898
I love you so much.

916
01:38:27.553 --> 01:38:28.815
Okay.

917
01:38:28.859 --> 01:38:30.295
Okay.
Go this way.

918
01:38:32.036 --> 01:38:33.342
No.

919
01:38:37.781 --> 01:38:39.087
- Rachel.

920
01:38:40.262 --> 01:38:42.177
Rachel. listen to me.

921
01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:45.006
Now. you're not well.

922
01:38:45.049 --> 01:38:47.486
Okay?
No one wants to hurt you.

923
01:38:47.530 --> 01:38:49.227
We want to help.

924
01:38:49.271 --> 01:38:50.663
