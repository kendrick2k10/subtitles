3
00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:51.677
Oh. my God.
It's so beautiful here.

4
00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:53.679
Isn't it exciting?

5
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.307
This place is amazing.

6
00:00:56.474 --> 00:00:58.726
If you are impressed
how it looks now.

7
00:00:58.893 --> 00:01:01.854
you should have seen it
when I was a child.

8
00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:06.066
One side of the square
was the Jewish market

9
00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.153
and the other.
the Slovak market.

10
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.071
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

11
00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:17.536
There was
a friendship between the two

12
00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.413
and mutual respect.

13
00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:03.707
This is my heder

14
00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.085
where I learned the Bible.

15
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:10.798
And this
is my grandfather's house

16
00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:12.216
where he lived.

17
00:02:12.883 --> 00:02:15.469
I'm making a neder.

18
00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:17.304
-Do you think that--
-What's a neder?

19
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.598
A neder is a promise to the Jews

20
00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:21.934
that they'll never be forgotten

21
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:24.436
and their history
and their behavior

22
00:02:24.603 --> 00:02:27.398
and their example
will live forever.

23
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.570
What happened to them?

24
00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:43.497
All the Jews. wake up!

25
00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.958
All the Jews need
to register for work.

26
00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.961
Young and old.

27
00:02:50.462 --> 00:02:51.797
Who does not want...

28
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.216
will be punished.

29
00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:57.803
They were not Nazis.

30
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.763
They were Hlinka Guards.

31
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.558
Slovakian State Police.

32
00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.812
Make sure to get
all the alleyways this time.

33
00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:09.023
not just the main square.

34
00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:11.358
The whole Jewish quarter?

35
00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:13.152
Yes.

36
00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:18.449
Every Jew. that's what it says.

37
00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:20.784
So everyone
can see it and read it.

38
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:24.288
They had to make sure
that every Jew in Bardejov

39
00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:26.582
knew what was expected of them.

40
00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:28.375
Thomas. is that you?

41
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.711
Good morning. Mrs. Schondof.

42
00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:32.546
-Hi. Thomas.
-Hi.

43
00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.214
It was mostly
friends and neighbors

44
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.341
who brought them the news.

45
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:36.634
Why so early?

46
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.510
Oh. I'm so sorry for waking you.

47
00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:39.970
It's not my doing.

48
00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:43.807
Oh. hi. Helena.
See you at football later.

49
00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:46.185
Yeah. See you.

50
00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:57.529
Lowy. the Jew.

51
00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.157
Refuel Lowy was the head

52
00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:02.826
of the Jewish community
in Bardejov.

53
00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.120
He was a successful businessman

54
00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:06.956
and a winemaker.

55
00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.042
Those who knew him.
respected him.

56
00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.294
And those who didn't.
feared him.

57
00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:15.965
You couldn't wait
'til a decent hour?

58
00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:23.055
Yes.

59
00:04:23.222 --> 00:04:26.016
into
the General Council at night.

60
00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:30.020
You'll be hearing from us.

61
00:04:33.107 --> 00:04:35.234
Oh. please.

62
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:37.736
and pay your drivers
better next time.

63
00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:44.368
Maybe it's not a good time...

64
00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:47.705
to bark orders. Mr. Lowy.

65
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.638
Let's go.
Get out of this smelly place.

66
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:08.934
Jew dogs.

67
00:05:19.862 --> 00:05:21.363
Refuel.

68
00:05:24.158 --> 00:05:26.535
-We were so worried.
-I'm fine.

69
00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.204
The meeting went 'til 3:00 a.m.

70
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.331
and then by the time
from Bratislava.

71
00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.083
You must be exhausted.

72
00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:37.129
I need to
and call the meeting.

73
00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:40.007
Where are the boys?

74
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:41.967
They're upstairs getting ready.

75
00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:43.635
Tell them to meet me at shul.

76
00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.349
-Do we need to register?
-No.

77
00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:53.062
We have a-- a yellow card. Yes.

78
00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.481
80 exempt families
are at the essentials.

79
00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:57.775
Okay? It's all right.

80
00:05:57.941 --> 00:05:59.568
Just a bit more complicated.

81
00:05:59.735 --> 00:06:01.528
The boys are scared. Refuel.

82
00:06:03.322 --> 00:06:06.075
There's too much happening
too quickly.

83
00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.078
People are talking.

84
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.625
Roza. I know
what I need to know.

85
00:06:18.087 --> 00:06:19.171
We are safe.

86
00:06:21.632 --> 00:06:23.383
-You're not.
-I am.

87
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:25.177
We are.

88
00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:27.971
I'm too vital for them.
Do you understand?

89
00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:36.939
Okay.

90
00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:52.306
Mama. we'll be back soon.
I'm going with Helena.

91
00:07:56.935 --> 00:07:58.020
Shh.

92
00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:06.320
-What is this?
-Shh.

93
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.339
My parents say this is for real.

94
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.889
I heard they've made
a deal with the Germans.

95
00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:35.432
Of course they have.

96
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.434
That's why the Germans
leaves us alone.

97
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.688
I just picked this with mom.

98
00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:44.858
Thank you. Magda.

99
00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.193
-Thank you.
-Take this.

100
00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:56.912
Amen.

101
00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:12.094
My father says we're exempt.

102
00:09:12.261 --> 00:09:13.512
They need us all to work

103
00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:15.430
that's why
they closed the schools.

104
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.183
I'd rather work
than go to school.

105
00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:23.355
My-- my father
wants us to leave...

106
00:09:24.231 --> 00:09:25.315
for Hungary.

107
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.318
He says this is a big sign.

108
00:09:30.028 --> 00:09:31.738
My cousins
from Poland just came.

109
00:09:33.407 --> 00:09:35.742
They say they'll be rounding up
and shooting--

110
00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:37.911
Shh.

111
00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:39.246
Don't talk like that.

112
00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:40.998
All the rumors are to scare us.

113
00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:45.544
Let's meet here
every morning eight o'clock.

114
00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.462
Bring whatever news you have.

115
00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.174
I'll have one other
to borrow

116
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:52.634
from goyish families.

117
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.638
Make sure every family
have a. okay?

118
00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.765
-All right.
-All right. Magda.

119
00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:00.434
Magda. you bring the cake.

120
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.768
Yes.

121
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:03.353
We are strong.

122
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:06.773
We are fighters.

123
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.109
We're together. We'll be okay.

124
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:12.571
Take us to
the headquarters..

125
00:10:13.238 --> 00:10:16.074
Hey. I'm not getting back
what that Jew said.

126
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.200
Slow down.

127
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.668
-Oh! What the--
-Jesus!

128
00:10:28.587 --> 00:10:31.173
Perfect timing.
Give Bomba the mail.

129
00:10:31.798 --> 00:10:33.175
Okay. Yes.

130
00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:36.845
To General Kovac in Bratislava.

131
00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:38.805
Right away. Captain.

132
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:44.019
General Kovac was
the captain of the Hlinka Guard

133
00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:46.855
overseeing
the Bardejov district.

134
00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:49.775
He was a snake in the grass

135
00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.277
and Stefan's main superior.

136
00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:33.944
From Adam.

137
00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:48.417
What does it say?

138
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.760
Give this back to him.

139
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.682
With this.

140
00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:04.933
All right.

141
00:12:05.392 --> 00:12:06.476
He is a good man.

142
00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.645
Passion should keep him safe.

143
00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:12.315
-We need him.
-I will see you upstairs.

144
00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.151
-I'll bring the.
-Yes.

145
00:12:14.317 --> 00:12:16.695
And the others. we need
the whole Jewish Council.

146
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:19.322
And-- and coffee.

147
00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:22.284
Please tell my son.
. to fetch me one.

148
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:23.618
I haven't slept.

149
00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:35.881
Thank you. Ben.

150
00:12:43.722 --> 00:12:45.098
Halberstam.
with your permission.

151
00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:46.850
-Sure.
-Sure.

152
00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:51.521
Clearly I couldn't
stop the order.

153
00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:56.234
Now we handed a letter
to give to President Tiso

154
00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:59.362
requesting assurance
that the work will stay local

155
00:12:59.529 --> 00:13:02.073
and that. uh.
protect the Slovakian Jews

156
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.658
from German deportations.

157
00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:06.995
-Assurance?
-What kind of assurance?

158
00:13:07.162 --> 00:13:09.706
Clearly we don't believe
their promises. all right?

159
00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:12.042
They're trying to make good
for the independence

160
00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:14.586
and they have to give
Hitler what he-- what he wants.

161
00:13:14.753 --> 00:13:15.795
They need us.

162
00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:18.256
The sheer numbers
of the economic force

163
00:13:18.423 --> 00:13:20.467
of the Slovakian Jews is
something to show the Germans.

164
00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:23.053
-Foolish to deport us.
-Absolutely.

165
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.639
Yeah. but we also
received a telegram from. uh.

166
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:28.308
the German other secretary.
uh. Martin. uh--

167
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.227
-Martin Luther?
-Yes.

168
00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:33.104
They're requesting
20.000 Slovakian Jews

169
00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:35.190
to work in the East.

170
00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:38.693
Now they're registering us.

171
00:13:39.903 --> 00:13:42.113
-That's just the beginning.
-It's just for show.

172
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.409
20.000. 90.000
Jews in all of Slovakia.

173
00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.912
And Tiso is going to pay...

174
00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:52.958
20.000 German marks per Jew

175
00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:55.085
to Hitler for the privilege.

176
00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:58.255
Ah. so we are making the money

177
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:01.007
to pay for our own deportation.

178
00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:04.553
What's the plan?
Who's getting deported?

179
00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:06.263
Those who can walk. I suppose.

180
00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.099
I don't think
they have a plan right now.

181
00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:12.143
But it's important that we keep

182
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.230
playing the game
for the time being.

183
00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:18.191
But it's important
to put a message out there.

184
00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.068
People need to register.

185
00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:23.029
We have to go through
these motions here.

186
00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:25.907
There are 450 families
in Bardejov.

187
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.869
4600 people.

188
00:14:30.036 --> 00:14:31.580
Listen.

189
00:14:31.746 --> 00:14:33.957
purim is Shaboss.

190
00:14:34.124 --> 00:14:36.543
All right. let's keep
things normal. Rabbi.

191
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.380
We need to make everything
just like pur.

192
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.925
Turn it on its head.
God willing.

193
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.137
Amen.

194
00:14:48.805 --> 00:14:51.141
Thursday is Taanit Esther.

195
00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:54.644
Two and a half
thousand years ago.

196
00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.771
she demanded a fast.

197
00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:59.608
We listened and we were saved.

198
00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:04.487
Make sure everyone
is fasting this time as well.

199
00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.156
It's-- it's important.

200
00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:09.492
Also. please...

201
00:15:10.577 --> 00:15:13.163
make sure that you have
a plan for your families.

202
00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:15.165
You understand?

203
00:15:16.583 --> 00:15:20.295
What about all the Polish Jews
that have come flooding in?

204
00:15:20.462 --> 00:15:22.047
Yeah. that's a--
that's a good point.

205
00:15:22.213 --> 00:15:23.965
Mayer.

206
00:15:24.132 --> 00:15:26.301
try to tell Helena
to stop for right now.

207
00:15:26.468 --> 00:15:28.219
All right?
Your daughter will understand.

208
00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:33.350
I-- I-- I don't know
how we can do anything.

209
00:15:33.516 --> 00:15:34.976
Well. she's a very
clever girl. all right?

210
00:15:35.143 --> 00:15:36.895
She's arranged
for hundreds of them.

211
00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.314
She can figure out a way.

212
00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:43.151
It makes sense to think
Slovakia is different.

213
00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:46.780
Safer. but we cannot
take the risk anymore.

214
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.282
What risk is it
to us to help them?

215
00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:52.535
How about overcrowding.
rations. typhus.

216
00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.371
Our leverage
is in our workforce.

217
00:15:54.537 --> 00:15:56.915
We need to remain
healthy. productive.

218
00:15:57.082 --> 00:15:58.541
This will protect us.

219
00:15:58.708 --> 00:16:00.710
We cannot
turn Jews away.

220
00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.545
I understand that.

221
00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:05.799
but we have to comply
with the order to buy more time.

222
00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:07.717
Curfew at seven.

223
00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:09.678
No doing business with Aryans.

224
00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:12.472
No walking on
the same side of the street.

225
00:16:13.014 --> 00:16:16.226
It's important
that we be very smart.

226
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.978
We be close to our families.

227
00:16:19.145 --> 00:16:22.941
close to each other
and make sure that we understand

228
00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:25.819
that we are living
in very dangerous times.

229
00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:29.823
We-- we just
put our trust in God

230
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.866
and pray for the best.

231
00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:34.202
We-- we have to believe...

232
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.329
he will save us.

233
00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:43.712
Friends. it's important
that you register.

234
00:16:44.212 --> 00:16:46.673
Each family head
must register his family.

235
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.551
We have to keep to the codex.
We have to be under the radar.

236
00:16:49.718 --> 00:16:51.720
Do what they ask us
to do so we can...

237
00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.222
work things out. please.

238
00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:57.142
It's better
we cooperate and keep calm.

239
00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:00.478
Hashem will keep us safe.

240
00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:06.025
Go upstairs.
Get your toys there.

241
00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:07.444
We'll go eat soon. Okay?

242
00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:10.321
-Hi.
-Hi.

243
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:11.781
I'm going to lie down.

244
00:17:11.948 --> 00:17:14.117
I know. I know. Refuel.
But two minutes.

245
00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:16.035
Roza. please.

246
00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.620
I promise we'll schmues later.

247
00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.956
I know. I know. but not me.

248
00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:22.917
-I promised them.
-Huh?

249
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:28.298
Really?

250
00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:30.842
They're your uncle's cousins.
your family.

251
00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:35.680
Yes. All Jews are family.

252
00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:37.265
Things are not
better here anymore.

253
00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:38.892
Things are much better here.

254
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:41.144
Refuel. listen to what
they have to say.

255
00:17:41.853 --> 00:17:43.396
-Only two.
-Only two.

256
00:17:53.823 --> 00:17:56.284
-We have the room.
-We have the room.

257
00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.912
We have nothing but room.

258
00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:03.416
Okay. All right.

259
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:13.009
-.
-They have our address. Helena.

260
00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.094
Did you plaster our address

261
00:18:15.261 --> 00:18:17.263
on every ghetto in Poland?

262
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.099
Helena. we need
to stop them coming.

263
00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:22.852
-It's not helping--
-I cannot. Daddy.

264
00:18:24.312 --> 00:18:25.814
We have a good system.

265
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.315
We're better off than they are.

266
00:18:27.482 --> 00:18:29.192
They know that.
And you know that.

267
00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:33.196
Mr. Lowy says
that we're already too crowded

268
00:18:33.363 --> 00:18:35.240
and they bring typhus.

269
00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:36.533
Let's see him turn them away.

270
00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:40.119
Darling. I'm not sure Bardejov

271
00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:42.872
is as protected
as they think it is.

272
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.375
As you think it is.

273
00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:49.712
Jewish businesses
were handed over to non-Jews.

274
00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.173
They were known as

275
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.760
put in place to control
the Jewish businesses.

276
00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:58.471
Fredrik
was Lowy's.

277
00:18:58.638 --> 00:19:00.849
but also his friend.

278
00:19:01.474 --> 00:19:03.268
You should have signed them.
Herr Director.

279
00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:04.978
You are the boss now. Fredrik.

280
00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:06.396
It seems absurd.

281
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.606
Yeah. it is.

282
00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.234
Herr Director. you and your
family are sorted. yeah?

283
00:19:13.278 --> 00:19:15.071
I can't do anything
for any of these people.

284
00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:17.323
But for you
and Roza and the boys.

285
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.284
We are good.
It's very kind. Fredrik.

286
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.661
I-- We have the--
the yellow card.

287
00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.372
All right.
so we exempt at least--

288
00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:25.957
at least from this one.

289
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.711
And Lowy.
you know if you ever need...

290
00:19:30.837 --> 00:19:32.755
I have a place for you
just outside these walls.

291
00:19:32.922 --> 00:19:34.299
It's my father's place.

292
00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:37.760
They've asked us
to take your passports.

293
00:19:37.927 --> 00:19:39.345
Yes.

294
00:19:40.597 --> 00:19:43.516
First. all rights then property.

295
00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.894
And now papers.

296
00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.271
Well. we're losing us to dogs.

297
00:19:48.438 --> 00:19:50.732
It's still better
than having the Germans here.

298
00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:53.526
Well. it's only because
you all so incompetent.

299
00:19:55.653 --> 00:19:58.156
Besides. we have. uh.
bigger jobs to do right now.

300
00:19:58.323 --> 00:19:59.866
Purim.

301
00:20:00.408 --> 00:20:03.119
There we go. you know. Fredrik.
you could pass as a Jew.

302
00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:06.039
Yes. purim.
Not tomorrow. The next day.

303
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.876
And everyone is getting
whatever wine they want

304
00:20:10.043 --> 00:20:11.377
for whatever they can give.

305
00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:12.879
And this is an order.
You understand?

306
00:20:13.046 --> 00:20:14.589
You're asking me to take a loss.

307
00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:16.424
Well. don't worry.
You'll make it up somehow.

308
00:20:17.592 --> 00:20:19.928
I want to thank you
for recruiting Adam.

309
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.430
He brought us
some very important information

310
00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:23.681
this morning.

311
00:20:26.726 --> 00:20:29.270
This is a sanctuary
more than a factory.

312
00:20:29.437 --> 00:20:30.855
Mm.

313
00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:33.942
Make sure today and tomorrow

314
00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:37.278
everyone has a chance to go
to the main square and register.

315
00:20:37.445 --> 00:20:38.863
-Yes.
-Stagger the groups.

316
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.365
Okay? Keep them busy.

317
00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:42.408
Yes. Yes. I-- I saw the notice.

318
00:20:45.828 --> 00:20:47.580
I wish this was
just a formality.

319
00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:56.005
-Na Zdravie!
-Na Zdravie!

320
00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:59.467
Na Zdravie.
Let's see the papers.

321
00:20:59.634 --> 00:21:00.718
Oh.

322
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.183
We don't know what they want
from all those Jews here.

323
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.186
Work. they're following orders
like good little Jews.

324
00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:13.106
They already work for us.
We own all their bloody stores.

325
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:14.524
I hear Tiso asked Himmler

326
00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:15.900
to take the whole lot of them.

327
00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:17.860
All 90.000 Jews in Slovakia.

328
00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.487
Himmler wanted the Jews out.

329
00:21:20.196 --> 00:21:22.782
Tiso asked him
to have them never return.

330
00:21:24.575 --> 00:21:25.868
You know what that means?

331
00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:27.161
That's why
they registering them.

332
00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:28.788
We are paying the Germans?

333
00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:31.833
20.000.

334
00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:35.962
-20.000 what?
-20.000.

335
00:21:36.587 --> 00:21:38.923
The order is for 20.000.

336
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:41.092
20.000 for what?

337
00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:43.511
Jews. you idiot.

338
00:21:43.678 --> 00:21:46.305
Signed by Martin Luther himself.

339
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.683
But we don't have
more than 4.000 here.

340
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:49.892
Yeah.

341
00:21:50.059 --> 00:21:52.645
Not all of them. you moron.

342
00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:54.522
20.000 total.

343
00:21:54.689 --> 00:21:55.982
-For what?
-For work.

344
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:57.233
You mean for death?

345
00:21:58.192 --> 00:22:01.029
What the German do with Jews.
it's not our problem.

346
00:22:02.196 --> 00:22:04.115
Our problem is Kovac

347
00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:07.160
and these bastards
who treat us like dogs.

348
00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:10.997
Their power
is going to their heads.

349
00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:19.213
Bratislava. Bratislava.

350
00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:24.886
They're sending replacements.

351
00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:28.056
-Jews?
-Guards.

352
00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:31.059
We are not to do nothing
until they come.

353
00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:33.394
My brother
in in Kosice.

354
00:22:33.561 --> 00:22:34.979
he told me that
they're all.

355
00:22:35.146 --> 00:22:37.065
-So they switch them up.
-But not us.

356
00:22:37.231 --> 00:22:38.274
No.

357
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:40.151
We can do the job ourselves.

358
00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:45.573
We call a curfew tomorrow
for all the Jews.

359
00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.116
Is that what it says?

360
00:22:50.495 --> 00:22:51.579
That what I said.

361
00:22:51.996 --> 00:22:57.627
♪ May the Angel ♪

362
00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:03.424
♪ Who protects from all evil ♪

363
00:23:03.508 --> 00:23:09.430
♪ Bless the children ♪

364
00:23:09.514 --> 00:23:15.436
♪ And call My name upon them ♪

365
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.733
♪ And call My name upon them ♪

366
00:23:24.779 --> 00:23:26.948
.

367
00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:30.785
I want 100 at least.

368
00:23:30.952 --> 00:23:32.995
To the brewery.

369
00:23:33.788 --> 00:23:35.164
We're waiting for.

370
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.587
What is this? Hey!

371
00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:44.090
Wait! No! No!

372
00:23:44.257 --> 00:23:45.675
-. Daddy!
-No!

373
00:23:45.842 --> 00:23:46.801
Daddy. no!

374
00:23:46.968 --> 00:23:48.344
Let him go. Let him go.

375
00:23:48.511 --> 00:23:51.848
-Let him--
-My baby! My baby!

376
00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:56.310
Please. Please.
. please. please.

377
00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.240
-Where's my kid? Jozef!
-Get down!

378
00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:11.033
. wake up!

379
00:24:12.994 --> 00:24:14.162
Magda..

380
00:24:14.328 --> 00:24:15.538
Come on. wake up.

381
00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:19.375
Wake up.

382
00:24:19.542 --> 00:24:22.628
Mr. Lowy! Open up. please.

383
00:24:23.171 --> 00:24:25.673
They took our kid. Mr. Lowy!

384
00:24:32.013 --> 00:24:34.765
Stefan. you sure
you have a plan?

385
00:24:34.932 --> 00:24:37.185
How many now?

386
00:24:40.021 --> 00:24:41.647
The brewery's almost full.

387
00:24:45.401 --> 00:24:46.527
Good.

388
00:24:47.236 --> 00:24:50.573
See. we know
how to round up Jews.

389
00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:55.912
What the hell are you planning
to do with all the crying?

390
00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:57.663
We not babysitter. Stefan.

391
00:24:58.206 --> 00:24:59.457
Figure it out.

392
00:25:00.458 --> 00:25:02.210
Do whatever you need to do.

393
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.884
Why you crying? Huh?

394
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.554
Does anyone know
what's going on?

395
00:25:13.721 --> 00:25:14.805
Shh!

396
00:25:18.226 --> 00:25:20.019
What are we going to do here?

397
00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:26.108
Helena.

398
00:25:29.237 --> 00:25:30.571
They're down in the brewery.

399
00:25:31.364 --> 00:25:32.740
Come on. let's go.
Let's help them.

400
00:25:32.907 --> 00:25:34.450
-Are you mad?
-We have to help them.

401
00:25:34.617 --> 00:25:36.035
Helena. Magda.

402
00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:37.912
Are you kidding?

403
00:25:38.079 --> 00:25:39.205
I know half
of these Hlinka Guards.

404
00:25:40.081 --> 00:25:41.707
Come on. Come on.

405
00:25:43.751 --> 00:25:46.128
What the hell
is going on. Reisteiter?

406
00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:49.465
Captain.

407
00:25:49.632 --> 00:25:51.717
Captain Reisteiter to you.

408
00:25:53.302 --> 00:25:54.971
I demand to know immediately.

409
00:25:57.932 --> 00:25:59.141
By what authority?

410
00:26:00.393 --> 00:26:03.187
I am the head of
the Jewish Council at Bardejov.

411
00:26:03.354 --> 00:26:05.439
Ah.

412
00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:10.528
In that case.
you can sign their work orders.

413
00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:15.950
These are Jewish children
under my jurisdiction.

414
00:26:16.117 --> 00:26:17.285
Your concern.

415
00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:20.037
But not your jurisdiction.

416
00:26:21.539 --> 00:26:24.458
-This is my property.
-It was.

417
00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:28.296
But it's been Aryanized
like all the others.

418
00:26:29.171 --> 00:26:31.048
Surely you're aware
of that already.

419
00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:34.760
Maybe you should
just sign the order.

420
00:26:35.428 --> 00:26:36.721
We spared your boys.

421
00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:38.514
Be grateful.

422
00:26:40.016 --> 00:26:41.350
Who gave the order?

423
00:26:42.852 --> 00:26:45.438
We are to round up
100 Jewish boys

424
00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:47.273
for work detail

425
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.526
in the fields tomorrow
to clean up the countryside.

426
00:26:52.862 --> 00:26:54.363
Clean the countryside.

427
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:55.823
Mr. Lowy...

428
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.992
it's very important

429
00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:00.745
that people
will understand the new reality.

430
00:27:01.495 --> 00:27:03.039
To know their place.

431
00:27:03.205 --> 00:27:05.166
Jewish picking up rubbish...

432
00:27:05.875 --> 00:27:07.251
has a nice ring to it.

433
00:27:07.418 --> 00:27:09.253
Who gave the order?

434
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.881
Who gave this order?
Who gave it?

435
00:27:13.591 --> 00:27:15.718
-Let go!
-.

436
00:27:16.886 --> 00:27:17.970
Herr Lowy.

437
00:27:19.472 --> 00:27:22.224
Jewish running
the show in Bardejov

438
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:23.809
is a thing of the past.

439
00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:26.312
And if you would like

440
00:27:26.479 --> 00:27:28.689
to see the inside
of the jail again.

441
00:27:28.856 --> 00:27:31.108
I can happily arrange it.

442
00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:36.864
Get him away from me.

443
00:27:45.539 --> 00:27:47.291
To. Quick!

444
00:27:47.458 --> 00:27:50.586
Lowy. use this.
As much as you need.

445
00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:56.592
Tell my wife I'm safe.
I'll be back in the morning.

446
00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:00.763
-Go!
-Good luck.

447
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:31.794
Gabriel. hey. come here.
Come here.

448
00:28:31.961 --> 00:28:34.463
-Come on. Come on.
-Psst! Gabriel.

449
00:28:35.089 --> 00:28:37.216
Gabriel. hey. come here.

450
00:28:37.383 --> 00:28:38.426
Come on. Come on.

451
00:28:38.592 --> 00:28:40.594
Come here. yes.

452
00:28:43.139 --> 00:28:44.682
Yes.

453
00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:50.646
Come on. Come on. Come on.

454
00:29:10.875 --> 00:29:14.128
Don't follow me.
I'm not here for you. Mr. Lowy.

455
00:29:14.628 --> 00:29:16.755
I have business
with Captain Reisteiter.

456
00:29:16.922 --> 00:29:19.842
If this keeps. I can no longer
promise calm and cooperation.

457
00:29:20.009 --> 00:29:21.760
Our debts are clear now.

458
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:25.598
Do your job Mr. Lowy
and stay clear.

459
00:29:37.151 --> 00:29:39.487
Stefan!

460
00:29:59.507 --> 00:30:00.799
It's not about the Jew.

461
00:30:01.634 --> 00:30:03.344
-Yes. it is.
-No.

462
00:30:05.054 --> 00:30:06.847
Let him think he was a big hero.

463
00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:09.767
I was going to have
a problem here regardless.

464
00:30:09.934 --> 00:30:12.186
It's them Jews.
think they can do--

465
00:30:12.353 --> 00:30:13.896
Think. yes.

466
00:30:14.605 --> 00:30:16.524
Let them think
whatever they want. it's good.

467
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:18.943
You and your men..

468
00:30:19.109 --> 00:30:20.611
we need the Jews compliant...

469
00:30:21.654 --> 00:30:22.738
hopeful.

470
00:30:23.864 --> 00:30:26.075
Could it be that
your

471
00:30:26.242 --> 00:30:27.701
will work to our advantage.

472
00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:30.746
They'll think they've won.

473
00:30:30.913 --> 00:30:32.623
They'll think they're protected.

474
00:30:34.833 --> 00:30:37.127
We have plans
in place for all Slovakia.

475
00:30:38.712 --> 00:30:40.047
We'll be moving them
by the thousands

476
00:30:40.214 --> 00:30:41.340
before you know it.

477
00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:43.634
I need to save face here.

478
00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:46.136
-My men.
-Don't worry.

479
00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:48.264
Just follow the plan.

480
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.100
That's what this pin means.

481
00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:55.062
Sir.

482
00:30:55.229 --> 00:30:58.065
there is a--
a boy with a high fever.

483
00:30:58.774 --> 00:30:59.984
Looks like typhus.

484
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.569
For God's sake!

485
00:31:03.112 --> 00:31:05.447
Get everyone away.
Leave him for the Jews.

486
00:31:05.614 --> 00:31:06.699
Yes. sir.

487
00:31:07.157 --> 00:31:10.119
You get your Jew
to get a doctor here

488
00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:12.246
and quarantine them under guard.

489
00:31:13.956 --> 00:31:15.583
If this spreads.

490
00:31:15.749 --> 00:31:17.376
it'll be your head
they come for.

491
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.004
Pieter. Slav.

492
00:32:02.546 --> 00:32:05.466
Refuel. please eat something.

493
00:32:05.633 --> 00:32:07.134
Who can eat?

494
00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:11.680
You used to have
an appetite. remember?

495
00:32:11.847 --> 00:32:12.931
Hmm.

496
00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:14.683
I'm not hungry.

497
00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:21.065
Mrs. Lowy. Refuel.

498
00:32:21.231 --> 00:32:23.692
Boy. typhus.

499
00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.905
One boy?

500
00:32:28.822 --> 00:32:29.865
So far.

501
00:32:30.032 --> 00:32:31.575
All right. isolate the boy

502
00:32:31.742 --> 00:32:33.577
and then make sure
that the family quarantine

503
00:32:33.744 --> 00:32:34.787
during Shabbos.

504
00:32:35.788 --> 00:32:36.955
We'll come to see him soon.

505
00:32:37.122 --> 00:32:39.541
Okay. Good Shabbos. Mrs. Lowy.

506
00:32:44.254 --> 00:32:46.423
All we need now
is a typhus outbreak.

507
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:48.592
Purim is here.

508
00:32:49.176 --> 00:32:50.386
The...

509
00:32:50.552 --> 00:32:52.179
The Rabbi is speaking.

510
00:32:57.768 --> 00:33:00.270
The evil Haman
sought to destroy us all.

511
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:02.564
The plan was in place.

512
00:33:04.191 --> 00:33:05.734
And who did he start with?

513
00:33:08.404 --> 00:33:10.114
Also the children.

514
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:12.074
Now...

515
00:33:13.117 --> 00:33:16.954
now we have
and new Haman just as evil.

516
00:33:18.539 --> 00:33:20.791
We all have to fast...

517
00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:22.584
to repent...

518
00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:25.838
to pour out our hearts.

519
00:33:27.339 --> 00:33:29.466
We need to believe
the Almighty can save us

520
00:33:29.633 --> 00:33:31.260
in the blink of an eye.

521
00:33:31.885 --> 00:33:35.055
The rumors from Poland
are terrifying. true.

522
00:33:35.681 --> 00:33:38.225
But today. here in Bardejov...

523
00:33:39.101 --> 00:33:42.604
we have our most powerful
weapons in place.

524
00:33:43.647 --> 00:33:47.484
Faith that the Almighty
will redeem his people.

525
00:33:48.235 --> 00:33:51.572
Faith that ultimately
the wicked are punished

526
00:33:51.739 --> 00:33:53.949
and the righteous prosper.

527
00:33:54.116 --> 00:33:57.327
But joy in being a Jew.

528
00:33:58.203 --> 00:33:59.955
So to here today.

529
00:34:00.122 --> 00:34:01.665
may the Almighty bless us

530
00:34:01.832 --> 00:34:04.460
with a turnaround
great and mighty.

531
00:34:05.377 --> 00:34:06.503
L'Chaim!

532
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:15.512
Hey. Ivan. Hey.

533
00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.682
Okay.

534
00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:21.769
I'm sorry. I just--
I brought you the money.

535
00:34:24.688 --> 00:34:26.774
Please. Just--

536
00:34:36.408 --> 00:34:38.827
Thank you.

537
00:34:38.994 --> 00:34:41.246
Thank you. All right.

538
00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:49.838
Thank you.

539
00:35:08.982 --> 00:35:10.609
Your men are late.

540
00:35:11.693 --> 00:35:14.822
We need them to lead the way.

541
00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.414
Get back to headquarters

542
00:35:24.581 --> 00:35:26.875
and make sure the message
is out to everyone.

543
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.711
Be here at once.

544
00:35:37.803 --> 00:35:39.680
We could use more information.

545
00:35:40.764 --> 00:35:42.641
This is the only entrance
from the square?

546
00:35:42.808 --> 00:35:45.686
This one
and one more at the far end.

547
00:35:45.853 --> 00:35:47.020
I'll tell the boys.

548
00:35:47.563 --> 00:35:50.148
Our orders are for girls

549
00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:52.818
16 to 20 years old. unmarried...

550
00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:56.947
for work in the shoe factory
in Eastern Slovakia.

551
00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:00.826
We-- We don't have that many.

552
00:36:05.414 --> 00:36:07.249
You have 312.

553
00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:11.086
When the time comes. your men
will escort mine to each home.

554
00:36:13.547 --> 00:36:15.757
We could handle the round up.

555
00:36:17.968 --> 00:36:20.387
Your men are too friendly
with these Jews.

556
00:36:20.846 --> 00:36:22.180
They grew up together.

557
00:36:22.806 --> 00:36:24.141
Half are bribed...

558
00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:26.560
half are neighbors.

559
00:36:28.228 --> 00:36:30.606
-It could be better coordinated.
-It is.

560
00:36:31.106 --> 00:36:32.900
This is it.
It's nothing personal.

561
00:36:33.066 --> 00:36:35.611
This is happening all over
Eastern Slovakia these days.

562
00:36:36.612 --> 00:36:38.614
Guards are switched out.
It's standard.

563
00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:43.285
Poprad is the transit station.

564
00:36:43.452 --> 00:36:45.078
It's under our command.

565
00:36:47.831 --> 00:36:50.417
You and your men.
Stefan. are the key.

566
00:36:51.043 --> 00:36:52.252
Be proud.

567
00:37:07.643 --> 00:37:09.144
Refuel. what is it?

568
00:37:09.853 --> 00:37:11.313
I'll go see.

569
00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.315
-Stay there. Go to the boys.
-All right.

570
00:37:16.193 --> 00:37:17.402
One minute.

571
00:37:20.697 --> 00:37:21.823
Adam.

572
00:37:23.951 --> 00:37:26.787
We didn't know.
They kept us all in the dark.

573
00:37:26.954 --> 00:37:28.413
.

574
00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.040
Hundreds.

575
00:37:30.582 --> 00:37:33.168
There is an order for 400 girls
for a shoe factory in the east.

576
00:37:35.128 --> 00:37:37.631
I cannot be seen.
I don't know any more.

577
00:37:39.925 --> 00:37:41.635
Thank you. All right.
God bless you.

578
00:37:41.802 --> 00:37:43.428
God bless you. Go.

579
00:37:45.973 --> 00:37:47.099
Ah. God.

580
00:37:49.518 --> 00:37:50.686
Refuel. what happened?

581
00:37:50.852 --> 00:37:52.896
Move!

582
00:37:53.063 --> 00:37:54.940
-Stay put. All right?
-Oh. God.

583
00:37:55.107 --> 00:37:56.441
-Get the boys.
-Oh. God.

584
00:37:56.608 --> 00:37:57.734
They come for
the girls just for work.

585
00:37:57.901 --> 00:37:59.820
Move!

586
00:38:02.322 --> 00:38:04.032
-You see? You see?
-Yes. Yes. I-- I know.

587
00:38:04.199 --> 00:38:06.118
Okay. I'm coming.
All right? I'll be coming.

588
00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:08.370
Go down.
make sure the boys stay.

589
00:38:08.537 --> 00:38:10.580
-Okay.
-Make sure the boys stay.

590
00:38:10.747 --> 00:38:12.457
Move!

591
00:38:14.626 --> 00:38:16.503
Pieter. Slav.

592
00:38:22.634 --> 00:38:24.177
He's here to provide support.

593
00:38:24.344 --> 00:38:27.055
Like we said. new guards.

594
00:38:28.807 --> 00:38:31.268
Our job will be
to show them the perimeter

595
00:38:31.435 --> 00:38:33.979
so it can be secured...

596
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.982
and identify the houses.

597
00:38:44.531 --> 00:38:45.615
Come here.

598
00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:57.586
Today is the day the Jews
begin to pay back their debt

599
00:38:57.753 --> 00:38:59.629
to Slovak People's Republic.

600
00:38:59.796 --> 00:39:01.048
They will work for us.

601
00:39:02.132 --> 00:39:04.384
When we say. how we say...

602
00:39:05.302 --> 00:39:06.595
and it begins today.

603
00:39:07.471 --> 00:39:10.474
300 names in this list
will be rounded up

604
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.976
and transferred
to the school under guard

605
00:39:13.143 --> 00:39:14.978
and move to Poprad
in the morning.

606
00:39:15.145 --> 00:39:16.605
There are no exceptions.

607
00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:21.651
Let them through.
Let them through.

608
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.528
Lowy.

609
00:39:26.156 --> 00:39:27.657
. Reisteiter.

610
00:39:27.824 --> 00:39:30.368
Your Jew
is coming right on time.

611
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:33.371
Where are they taking the girls?

612
00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:34.873
Oh. he's very good.

613
00:39:35.332 --> 00:39:37.209
You should ask
yourself how he knows already.

614
00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:39.169
Where?

615
00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:42.506
Here are the details. Herr Lowy.

616
00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:45.842
Or you can read them on
the walls like all the others.

617
00:39:46.676 --> 00:39:48.970
This is not the agreement
I had with Bratislava.

618
00:39:49.513 --> 00:39:52.557
Okay. the Council is meant to be
informed of any new decisions.

619
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.936
Bratislava is well aware. Jew.

620
00:39:56.478 --> 00:39:58.605
I will be commanding
the Bardejov Operation

621
00:39:58.772 --> 00:40:00.148
from here on out.

622
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:11.910
I'm heading back
to Poprad after this.

623
00:40:13.036 --> 00:40:14.788
I have over 1000 Jewish girls

624
00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:16.998
to put on trains
in the next two days.

625
00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.418
I expect things
will run smoothly here.

626
00:40:25.799 --> 00:40:27.425
"Three months' work detail.

627
00:40:28.343 --> 00:40:30.637
All girls on the list
will be escorted

628
00:40:30.804 --> 00:40:32.889
to the Jewish school
by nightfall...

629
00:40:33.682 --> 00:40:36.685
to depart by train at 6:00 a.m.

630
00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:40.730
You may bring one bag.
15 kilo...

631
00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:42.983
securely tied.

632
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.403
Labeled. first and last name."

633
00:40:48.321 --> 00:40:50.782
"Each girl
will carry her own case

634
00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:53.285
and wait by the door
for the escort.

635
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:57.247
Girls will be escorted
by Hlinka guard only.

636
00:40:58.039 --> 00:40:59.374
No accompaniment."

637
00:40:59.541 --> 00:41:02.085
"If anyone fails to report...

638
00:41:03.003 --> 00:41:05.422
they will be
considered deserters...

639
00:41:09.092 --> 00:41:11.469
and sent
to the concentration camp."

640
00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:14.639
"Mandatory curfew
from 2:00 p.m. until 8:00 a.m.

641
00:41:17.517 --> 00:41:19.561
Severe punishment if broken."

642
00:41:19.728 --> 00:41:21.605
"No one with typhus allowed.

643
00:41:22.981 --> 00:41:25.025
Medical exemption required...

644

by Hlinka medic.

645
00:41:27.903 --> 00:41:31.489
Forgery is a high crime
with severe punishment.

646
00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:35.160
Anyone on the list
has one hour to pack.

647
00:41:36.328 --> 00:41:37.996
Be ready for escort.

648
00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:40.081

will return in three months
with 600 coin each...

compensation.

651

Sergeant Kovac."

652
00:41:51.092 --> 00:41:52.344
Who's that?

653
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.388
I know him well and he knows me.

654
00:41:57.098 --> 00:41:59.476
We've crossed paths
many times in Bratislava.

655
00:42:00.727 --> 00:42:02.520
This goes all the way up. Roza.

656
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.564
What do you mean?

657
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:06.358
Well. Kovac. Tiso...

658
00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:08.985
is all the same.

659
00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:12.030
Jozef Tiso. President Tiso?

660
00:42:12.656 --> 00:42:15.575
This is for real.

661
00:42:20.497 --> 00:42:22.332
I need to find out
what's really going on.

662
00:42:22.499 --> 00:42:23.583
Okay?

663
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:25.293
Boys. you call the Council.

664
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.045
All right. tell the

665
00:42:27.212 --> 00:42:29.464
I'm gonna go to Bratislava.
to the resistance.

666
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:31.466
I have to go talk to resistance.
All right?

667
00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:34.010
-Please. please be careful.
-Tell everyone to remain calm.

668
00:42:34.177 --> 00:42:35.428
-Please be careful.
-Nothing.

669
00:42:35.595 --> 00:42:36.763
-I'll be careful.
-God protect us.

670
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:37.973
Yes.

671
00:42:59.035 --> 00:43:00.412
Magda is on the list. too.

672
00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:03.248
But I have a yellow card.

673
00:43:04.666 --> 00:43:07.085
Lowy is going
to the underground.

674
00:43:07.252 --> 00:43:09.546
Let us wait
and see what they know.

675
00:43:12.007 --> 00:43:13.883
We are the damn Council

676
00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:17.929
and people are looking to us
and we don't know a thing.

677
00:43:18.972 --> 00:43:21.683
How could we not know anything

678
00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:23.601
with all our connections?

679
00:43:25.854 --> 00:43:26.980
We should let them go.

680
00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:29.899
It makes sense.

681
00:43:30.442 --> 00:43:31.901
Unmarried girls going to work.

682
00:43:34.154 --> 00:43:37.365
They need the production.
they'll pay the girls.

683
00:43:37.532 --> 00:43:39.367
Oh. it doesn't make sense.

684
00:43:39.534 --> 00:43:41.161
Why 300 girls?

685
00:43:41.328 --> 00:43:43.538
Doesn't pay for any less time.

686
00:43:43.705 --> 00:43:46.249
But you expect them to
transport them back and forth?

687
00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:47.667
I don't get it.

688
00:43:47.834 --> 00:43:49.252
You heard
the rumors from Poland.

689
00:43:49.419 --> 00:43:50.712
It's a war.

690
00:43:50.879 --> 00:43:52.672
Slovakia and the Germans
are allies.

691
00:43:53.465 --> 00:43:54.924
Poland is the real enemy.

692
00:43:55.592 --> 00:43:57.093
We are the workforce.
They need us.

693
00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.845
Oh. come on.

694
00:43:59.012 --> 00:44:01.556
They're not going
to have 400 girls disappear.

695
00:44:01.723 --> 00:44:04.225
They'll write to us.
We'll hear from them.

696
00:44:04.392 --> 00:44:07.187
You read the decree. 600 koruna.

697
00:44:07.354 --> 00:44:10.148
Everyone here is starving.
We-- we don't own anything.

698
00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:12.859
And this is their way to get us.

699
00:44:13.026 --> 00:44:14.444
Who couldn't use the money?

700
00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:20.492
I don't know. I don't care.

701
00:44:22.494 --> 00:44:24.454
You can't start a rebellion
on the street. Erwin.

702
00:44:24.621 --> 00:44:25.872
It'll be a bloodbath.

703
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.127
We have to go with it for now.

704
00:44:31.836 --> 00:44:33.630
They're not going.

705
00:44:38.051 --> 00:44:39.135
And then what?

706
00:44:39.761 --> 00:44:42.430
If they don't find her.
they'll come for you.

707
00:44:48.812 --> 00:44:50.563
Mama. they're going to go.

708
00:44:51.231 --> 00:44:52.357
It will be okay.

709
00:44:55.735 --> 00:44:57.821
-Magda.
-Mama. please.

710
00:44:58.780 --> 00:44:59.864
We're strong.

711
00:45:00.365 --> 00:45:02.075
We can work hard
and bring you money.

712
00:45:02.992 --> 00:45:04.953
I can't let you go. Helena.

713
00:45:05.662 --> 00:45:06.746
Mama.

714
00:45:07.372 --> 00:45:08.456
Yes. you can.

715
00:45:08.957 --> 00:45:10.375
The other girls needs us. too.

716
00:45:11.334 --> 00:45:12.419
Don't worry.

717
00:45:16.256 --> 00:45:19.008
If you tell us to go. we will.

718
00:45:29.144 --> 00:45:30.770
Tell your friends to pack.

719
00:45:31.271 --> 00:45:32.355
Calmly.

720
00:45:35.191 --> 00:45:39.028
We will do everything we can
to get to the bottom of this.

721
00:45:40.947 --> 00:45:42.574
Now.

722
00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:43.950
everybody home.

723
00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:46.035
Get ready.

724
00:45:46.202 --> 00:45:48.413
Men. we going to meet
at the shul...

725
00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:52.417
the minute Refuel is back

726
00:45:52.584 --> 00:45:55.879
and we have only until two

727
00:45:56.045 --> 00:45:58.339
to get everything
we need for the girls

728
00:45:58.506 --> 00:45:59.883
then lock down.

729
00:47:04.364 --> 00:47:08.201
15 kilos.
one bag. clearly labeled.

730
00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.370
Wait for your escort.

731
00:47:12.247 --> 00:47:15.583
-Schondorf?
-32 Sokovia Street.

732
00:47:43.278 --> 00:47:44.529
Helena Schondorf?

733
00:47:45.113 --> 00:47:46.155
Yes.

734
00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:06.050
Don't worry.

735
00:48:06.801 --> 00:48:08.344
It's only for a few months.

736
00:48:09.304 --> 00:48:10.388
All right.

737
00:49:23.961 --> 00:49:26.339
All the Jews girls
ready for work.

738
00:49:39.102 --> 00:49:40.311
There.

739
00:50:22.729 --> 00:50:24.355
I-- uh.

740
00:50:24.522 --> 00:50:26.566
I'm picking up a prescription

741
00:50:26.733 --> 00:50:27.900
for Hershe.

742
00:50:38.995 --> 00:50:40.413
I told you he'd show up.

743
00:50:40.955 --> 00:50:42.331
Glad you were expecting me.

744
00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:44.542
That means
you know what's going on.

745
00:50:44.917 --> 00:50:46.794
Tell me what you know.

746
00:50:46.961 --> 00:50:49.672
We know the Hlinka Guard. uh.
are involved in the roundups.

747
00:50:50.882 --> 00:50:53.426
Poprad is a local
transit center.

748
00:50:53.593 --> 00:50:55.595
At least 1000 people...

749
00:50:56.846 --> 00:50:59.015
girls in the next two days.

750
00:50:59.932 --> 00:51:03.519
Is there a--
a shoe factory in Brezovec?

751
00:51:07.482 --> 00:51:10.067
There is no
shoe factory in Brezovec.

752
00:51:14.197 --> 00:51:15.698
Where are the trains going?

753
00:51:19.702 --> 00:51:22.288
Where are the trains going?

754
00:51:34.008 --> 00:51:35.009
Stop the car.

755
00:51:35.176 --> 00:51:36.928
Stop the car!

756
00:52:03.079 --> 00:52:04.372
What?

757
00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:05.748
What do you want. you d--

758
00:52:07.333 --> 00:52:09.710
You dog! You dog!

759
00:52:09.877 --> 00:52:12.338
You dog.

760
00:52:13.881 --> 00:52:15.967
Stop. stop. stop. stop.
Stop. Stop.

761
00:52:24.433 --> 00:52:26.018
We shall see. Jew.

762
00:52:45.079 --> 00:52:47.832
Let's go.

763
00:53:09.979 --> 00:53:11.063
Lowy.

764
00:53:12.398 --> 00:53:13.441
Tell us they're okay.

765
00:53:13.608 --> 00:53:14.692
You found the factory?

766
00:53:17.695 --> 00:53:18.905
Auschwitz.

767
00:53:19.488 --> 00:53:21.282
-Auschwitz?
-Auschwitz?

768
00:53:21.449 --> 00:53:23.326
-Auschwitz?
-Auschwitz?

769
00:53:23.492 --> 00:53:26.203
A camp called Auschwitz.
Prisoner camp.

770
00:53:29.498 --> 00:53:31.417
The prisoners
are making shoes now?

771
00:53:35.838 --> 00:53:37.590
It's not a shoe factory.

772
00:53:38.883 --> 00:53:40.217
What is it then?

773
00:53:43.763 --> 00:53:45.973
Executions. Gassings.

774
00:53:46.515 --> 00:53:47.975
It's a death camp.

775
00:53:54.398 --> 00:53:55.775
They have already killed...

776
00:53:56.734 --> 00:53:57.902
hundreds of Russians.

777
00:53:58.444 --> 00:54:01.030
-Jews?
-No. not yet.

778
00:54:02.865 --> 00:54:05.159
But they're building a new camp.

779
00:54:05.326 --> 00:54:06.953
A massive new camp...

780
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:08.955
for us.

781
00:54:12.375 --> 00:54:14.794
Our girls are not
coming back from there.

782
00:54:14.961 --> 00:54:16.796
Not just our girls.

783
00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:18.839
Thousands...

784
00:54:21.133 --> 00:54:23.094
of Jewish girls
from all over Slovakia.

785
00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.513
We cannot let them go.

786
00:54:26.931 --> 00:54:30.101
-Let's storm the school.
-Have you seen how many guards?

787
00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:33.354
-It's suicide if we do that.
-Let's call the partisans.

788
00:54:33.521 --> 00:54:34.772
My Helena.

789
00:54:38.234 --> 00:54:39.652
They are still right here.

790
00:54:39.819 --> 00:54:41.362
We have to do something.

791
00:54:42.613 --> 00:54:45.241
Lowy. what are you thinking?

792
00:54:46.659 --> 00:54:48.869
Soviet war..

793
00:54:49.036 --> 00:54:51.330
mass murder. gas chambers.

794
00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:54.333
All true.

795
00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.211
Now Auschwitz. now our girls...

796
00:54:58.337 --> 00:55:00.172
and we're going to be next.

797
00:55:00.339 --> 00:55:02.008
We'll follow them
to the slaughter.

798
00:55:03.092 --> 00:55:04.427
Faster! Go!

799
00:55:04.593 --> 00:55:05.970
The fate of Slovakian Jewry

800
00:55:06.137 --> 00:55:07.638
is written on the wall.

801
00:55:09.765 --> 00:55:11.600
But wishing it was different...

802
00:55:11.767 --> 00:55:13.185
Sit down. Fast!

803
00:55:13.352 --> 00:55:14.437
...won't change.

804
00:55:15.396 --> 00:55:19.150
Thousands of girls were stolen
from their homes tonight.

805
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:22.111
And how many more to follow?

806
00:55:22.945 --> 00:55:25.489
We need to send
the world a message.

807
00:55:27.867 --> 00:55:29.493
What you're suggesting?

808
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:34.582
I have enough gasoline
and gunpowder in my warehouse...

809
00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:37.877
to blow the whole
of Bardejov sky high...

810
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.756
Bardejov burn to the ground

811
00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:43.716
by its people. by the Jews.

812
00:55:44.216 --> 00:55:46.427
And the Germans
will then understand

813
00:55:46.594 --> 00:55:48.596
that they cannot
take us and leave.

814
00:55:50.097 --> 00:55:52.058
Many people will die.

815
00:55:53.392 --> 00:55:54.935
Many Jews will die.

816
00:55:55.436 --> 00:55:56.604
I know.

817
00:55:57.063 --> 00:55:59.231
They take our daughters...

818
00:56:00.357 --> 00:56:02.401
and-- and we kill theirs?

819
00:56:02.568 --> 00:56:04.987
We save our daughters
and who knows how many.

820
00:56:06.447 --> 00:56:09.408
There will be no train
leaving from Bardejov tomorrow.

821
00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:12.536
There will be no Bardejov.

822
00:56:13.412 --> 00:56:14.580
Where we will go?

823
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:16.999
We'll all be shot within hours.

824
00:56:17.166 --> 00:56:18.834
Killed like animals.

825
00:56:19.001 --> 00:56:20.127
By-- by whom?

826
00:56:20.669 --> 00:56:23.089
They will be running
for their lives. too.

827
00:56:25.591 --> 00:56:26.675
Uh. Lowy...

828
00:56:27.885 --> 00:56:29.386
I cannot allow it.

829
00:56:30.763 --> 00:56:33.307
The only question is. what...

830
00:56:34.475 --> 00:56:36.185
does God say?

831
00:56:37.686 --> 00:56:41.398
In here.
I don't think He says yes.

832
00:56:47.822 --> 00:56:50.241
Here.
Come here.

833
00:56:56.664 --> 00:57:00.084
Good evening.
Mr. Bear and Mr. Rabbit.

834
00:57:00.793 --> 00:57:03.003
You have a carrot for me?

835
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:06.507
I'm just joking.
Give me a cigarette.

836
00:57:06.674 --> 00:57:09.135
-I'm scared.
-Be brave.

837
00:57:11.971 --> 00:57:13.931
Listen. guys.
I have something for you.

838
00:57:15.683 --> 00:57:16.851
Pure gold.

839
00:57:17.643 --> 00:57:19.812
Follow me. Follow me.

840
00:57:23.232 --> 00:57:25.484
You could buy
something for your wife.

841
00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:27.987
your second wife.

842
00:57:30.531 --> 00:57:31.991
Here. take the watch.

843
00:57:32.741 --> 00:57:36.245
And for you. Mr. Rabbit.
you can take it all.

844
00:57:37.079 --> 00:57:38.122
That's for you.

845
00:57:41.208 --> 00:57:44.253
Ah. you saw
the football game yesterday.

846
00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.380
They got them Germans.

847
00:57:46.547 --> 00:57:48.340
They know how to play.
Huh?

848
00:57:49.967 --> 00:57:51.468
It's all right. It's all right.

849
00:57:51.635 --> 00:57:52.928
It's going to be okay.

850
00:57:53.804 --> 00:57:55.723
It's okay. It's okay.

851
00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:57.016
Here.

852
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:59.560
She must come with me!

853
00:57:59.727 --> 00:58:01.312
It's all right.
What's the matter?

854
00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:03.606
She's sick. She must be removed.

855
00:58:03.772 --> 00:58:05.191
She's just scared.
Leave her alone.

856
00:58:05.357 --> 00:58:07.860
-It's all right.
-Mommy.

857
00:58:08.027 --> 00:58:09.445
She has typhus.

858
00:58:09.612 --> 00:58:11.488
-She cannot stay.
-She's just scared.

859
00:58:12.323 --> 00:58:14.200
Leave us. I'll bring her to you.

860
00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.622
Everything will be okay.

861
00:58:19.788 --> 00:58:21.248
At least she will go home.

862
00:58:26.253 --> 00:58:27.796
Okay. I'm sorry.

863
00:58:27.963 --> 00:58:29.590
Thank you. God bless you.

864
00:58:34.595 --> 00:58:36.263
Shh.

865
00:58:41.185 --> 00:58:42.770
-Give it to me.
-Thank you.

866
00:58:44.104 --> 00:58:46.023
Take that to him. Do it quickly.

867
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:54.949
Adam. Adam.

868
00:58:59.328 --> 00:59:01.205
-Take this.
-What is it?

869
00:59:01.956 --> 00:59:03.040
Just-- just take it.

870
00:59:03.958 --> 00:59:05.084
Thank you.

871
00:59:27.856 --> 00:59:28.941
Come.

872
00:59:29.984 --> 00:59:32.361
There's no way out.
It's sealed shut.

873
00:59:32.528 --> 00:59:34.780
Barbed wire. barricades.

874
00:59:34.947 --> 00:59:36.573
They're
the extra troops.

875
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:39.326
You will never be able
to take 300 girls.

876
00:59:40.452 --> 00:59:42.997
If you have someone here
that know how to speak with God.

877
00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:44.498
now it's the time.

878
00:59:47.293 --> 00:59:48.377
From the girls.

879
01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:02.599
Is there a way in?

880
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:04.435
I don't know. I...

881
01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.479
I suppose.

882
01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:11.984
What are you
going to do. Mr. Lowy?

883
01:00:12.151 --> 01:00:15.195
Blow it up?

884
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.369
Besides the Jews...

885
01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:26.332
what is the one thing
the Germans are most afraid of?

886
01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:28.000
There are no Germans here. Lowy.

887
01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:30.044
Yes. yes there are.

888
01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:33.297
Auschwitz is theirs.

889
01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:34.798
This is their plan.

890
01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:37.509
Hlinka Guards
are their errand boys.

891
01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:38.802
They're here.

892
01:00:40.054 --> 01:00:41.972
And what are
they most afraid of?

893
01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:44.350
-The Russians?
-No. no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

894
01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:47.061
What kills their plans?

895
01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:48.771
Puts a wrench
in their whole machine?

896
01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:50.564
-Kills production?
-Enough!

897
01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:52.232
What?

898
01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:54.777
Typhus.

899
01:00:57.529 --> 01:00:59.615
It's brilliant.

900
01:00:59.782 --> 01:01:02.785
If we can get
enough serum for the girls.

901
01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:04.161
if we can get in...

902
01:01:05.204 --> 01:01:08.540
it'll create an epidemic.

903
01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:11.543
How much do we need?

904
01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:14.963
A double dose of serum
will bring out symptoms.

905
01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.465
That should be enough.

906
01:01:16.632 --> 01:01:19.259
It will declare
Bardejov of infected.

907
01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:21.512
Seal us off
and force a quarantine.

908
01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:22.971
Who has the authority?

909
01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:25.808
Dr. Milos Baratis
in

910
01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:28.519
is a district head medic.

911
01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.896
So how many people
need to show symptoms?

912
01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:32.689
Five won't stop the trains.

913
01:01:34.108 --> 01:01:35.275
10-15...

914
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.152
should do it.

915
01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:39.363
How dangerous is a double dose?

916
01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.121
-There is a risk.
-A real risk.

917
01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:50.457
An outbreak. maybe worse.

918
01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:53.210
But there are guards everywhere.

919
01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:55.587
How will we even get inside?

920
01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:57.673
-Boris.
-The plumber?

921
01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:00.634
He has access to the sewers.

922
01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:02.761
They run directly
beneath the school.

923
01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:04.471
Forget about how we get in.

924
01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.932
H-- how can we get
enough serum this quickly?

925
01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:08.183
Kosice.

926
01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:10.561
In Kosice.

927
01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.688
It's a two hour drive.

928
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.817
And they're not exactly
waiting for us either.

929
01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:18.777
You-- you won't be back
till midnight.

930
01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:21.071
Who says it's enough time

931
01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.407
for the serum to take effect?

932
01:02:23.574 --> 01:02:26.201
Dr. Baratis will need
to declare an epidemic

933
01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:28.162
and this will
stop the transport.

934
01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:31.248
And we need to have early
enough to show these symptoms.

935
01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:33.917
Can we really do this?

936
01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.670
Bomba. can you get us in?

937
01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:38.964
I'm not sure. Maybe one of you.

938
01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:41.091
No. Has to be two.

939
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.885
Two of us.

940
01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:45.596
This is...

941
01:02:46.472 --> 01:02:47.764
this is our plan.

942
01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.184
Okay? There's nothing else.

943
01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:55.606
If anyone has any objection.
please speak now.

944
01:02:59.485 --> 01:03:01.904
Josef. you have
to go to Kosice now.

945
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:04.198
Hurry up.
Get enough serum for the girls.

946
01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:06.366
You're going to administer it.
I'll meet you there.

947
01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.744
Bomba. go get Boris.

948
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:10.412
If there is a way
into the sewer.

949
01:03:10.579 --> 01:03:12.122
we need to know for certain.

950
01:03:12.581 --> 01:03:14.875
I will get
the outbreak declaration set up.

951
01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:17.669
I will meet my people in Zborov.

952
01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.798
We meet at the brewery at 12:30.

953
01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:23.800
All right.
Now go home to your families.

954
01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.052
Pray.

955
01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:27.679
Love your families.

956
01:03:28.597 --> 01:03:30.224
And may God help us.

957
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:31.975
Amen.

958
01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:51.745
Hey. Bomba.

959
01:03:55.249 --> 01:03:56.458
Captain.

960
01:03:58.418 --> 01:03:59.503
You know...

961
01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.345
I thought I'd come to see

962
01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:11.473
what the Jews
would be doing now...

963
01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:17.396
that we got
their daughters all locked up.

964
01:04:21.942 --> 01:04:23.026
I mean...

965
01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:27.030
they have to come up
with something.

966
01:04:28.115 --> 01:04:29.241
Don't you think?

967
01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:34.288
I'm not sure
what you want me to say.

968
01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.999
I should shoot you
right now for treason!

969
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.509
It's illegal to hurt Jews.

970
01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:50.262
You know that. right?

971
01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:53.557
I...

972
01:04:54.766 --> 01:04:56.518
I-- I really don't know.

973
01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:01.398
Please tell me.

974
01:05:02.858 --> 01:05:04.443
Why do you wanna help them?

975
01:05:08.155 --> 01:05:10.240
I'm not like you. Stefan.

976
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.291
You are not like them either.

977
01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:26.506
People deserve better.

978
01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:28.216
Jews are not people!

979
01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:32.638
We are all God's people.

980
01:05:37.017 --> 01:05:38.310
Then you can join them.

981
01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:57.412
Next time...

982
01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.165
I shoot you for real.

983
01:06:02.918 --> 01:06:04.336
suka.

984
01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:07.422
Suka.

985
01:06:08.674 --> 01:06:09.758
Suka.

986
01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:58.682
They're all dead.

987
01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:00.642
14 Brezdenova Street. Quick.

988
01:07:00.809 --> 01:07:01.977
Here.

989
01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:10.736
You told me

990
01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:12.320
if I ever needed help...

991
01:07:13.822 --> 01:07:15.282
Well. I need help.

992
01:07:15.449 --> 01:07:17.075
What will you tell them
when they find out?

993
01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:18.577
-They won't.
-They will.

994
01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:21.621
Real typhus spreads
and kills and lasts for weeks.

995
01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:23.957
The girls will be
on in a few days.

996
01:07:24.124 --> 01:07:26.918
No one will know. I promise.

997
01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:28.628
They will have to kill me first.

998
01:07:30.172 --> 01:07:32.591
Please. help us.

999
01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:55.197
Mr. Lowy. what can I do for you?

1000
01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:56.698
I really need
your help now. Fredrik.

1001
01:07:56.865 --> 01:07:58.283
Whatever you need.

1002
01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:01.036
Your boys.
they're Hlinka Guards. correct?

1003
01:08:01.495 --> 01:08:03.038
Yes. Yes. they are.

1004
01:08:03.205 --> 01:08:05.290
I need them to call this number.

1005
01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.918
5:30 a.m. sharp.

1006
01:08:08.084 --> 01:08:10.253
Report a typhus outbreak
in the school.

1007
01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.714
On your word.
I'll have them call.

1008
01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:17.010
But if I may. Mr. Lowy.
you don't have daughters.

1009
01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:19.888
I promised you a hideout
and a safe passage.

1010
01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:21.807
I could arrange it
for you tonight even.

1011
01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:23.558
Things are changing.
I don't know if--

1012
01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:25.727
Fredrik. thank you.
Thank you.

1013
01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:27.562
But I must stay.

1014
01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:29.397
Please make sure this happens.

1015
01:08:31.775 --> 01:08:33.276
Take care of yourself. Mr. Lowy.

1016
01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:35.487
You're a good man. Fredrik.

1017
01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:34.045
I could get shot
just for having you here.

1018
01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:36.673
We know
and we'll-- we'll.

1019
01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.758
-You want me to lie?
-No.

1020
01:09:39.467 --> 01:09:41.219
We don't want you to lie.
All right?

1021
01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:43.138
The girls will show symptoms.

1022
01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:46.099
All you need to do is confirm
and send a quarantine.

1023
01:09:46.266 --> 01:09:47.225
That's it.

1024
01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:48.810
Why do you need me then?

1025
01:09:49.519 --> 01:09:52.564
Any doctor will do
the same without knowing.

1026
01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:55.609
. the symptoms
won't be strong enough.

1027
01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:57.944
The train leaves at 6:30.

1028
01:09:58.111 --> 01:09:59.487
We can't take any chances.

1029
01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:03.909
Please. we know
that you're a good man.

1030
01:10:04.075 --> 01:10:06.870
All right?
Miroslav told us what you did.

1031
01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:08.663
And now he's dead.

1032
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:09.915
The fate...

1033
01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:12.751
of 300 girls...

1034
01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:15.670
is in your pen.

1035
01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.965
Please. help us.

1036
01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.509
Sign the quarantine. All right?

1037
01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:37.817
Give it to Miroslav's family.

1038
01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:49.496
300 girls. innocent.

1039
01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:53.124
What have they done?

1040
01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:54.960
Understand this.

1041
01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.341
If I sign this
and you don't get to them.

1042
01:11:01.508 --> 01:11:03.009
I'm as good as dead.

1043
01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:22.028
All good.

1044
01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:27.867
It's all right.

1045
01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:31.663
It's going to be all right.
They're gonna come.

1046
01:11:39.129 --> 01:11:40.213
They're gonna come.

1047
01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:53.601
You have five minutes.

1048
01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:55.854
Please make it fast.
I will watch the door.

1049
01:11:56.021 --> 01:11:57.272
-All right. thank you.
-Thank you. Adam.

1050
01:11:57.439 --> 01:11:58.732
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1051
01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:00.025
-Girls--
-Girls. how are you?

1052
01:12:00.734 --> 01:12:01.818
Girls...

1053
01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:03.903
you must listen to me.

1054
01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.323
You cannot get
on the train tomorrow.

1055
01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.660
There's only one way
out of this.

1056
01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:12.662
Typhus. You.

1057
01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.164
Yes.

1058
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.623
I'm gonna have
to give you a serum.

1059
01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:17.250
It's gonna make you
a little sick.

1060
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:19.252
It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

1061
01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:22.047
Okay. we must do it quick.
so it works fast.

1062
01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:24.299
Is it dangerous?

1063
01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:26.342
Yes.

1064
01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:29.971
But not as dangerous as
getting on that train tomorrow.

1065
01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:34.684
No time to waste then.

1066
01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:37.103
But we need
more than four girls.

1067
01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.981
-How many girls do you need?
-We need all of you.

1068
01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:43.693
All right. All of us.

1069
01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.236
Okay. we must move now.
Let's go.

1070
01:12:45.403 --> 01:12:46.446
We do it right now.

1071
01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:49.741
-Let's go. File up.
-Come on.

1072
01:13:06.508 --> 01:13:07.592
Baratis.

1073
01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:09.511
Yes.

1074
01:13:10.345 --> 01:13:11.471
On my way.

1075
01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:44.504
Go. Go.

1076
01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:46.005
-Welcome to the train.
-Stop! Stop!

1077
01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:48.383
No. they're not going anywhere.
Stop!

1078
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:49.509
-Stop!
-Who the hell are you?

I don't care who you are.
I give the orders.

1101
01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:38.057
Do you understand?

1102
01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:40.560
President Tiso's office.

1103

Yes.

1104
01:14:43.563 --> 01:14:45.648
Yeah. tell President Tiso

1105
01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:47.525

can be contained locally.

1106
01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:49.652
The others c-- can proceed.

They ask we keep
this quiet. General.

1109
01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:02.123

Good day. General.

Enough!

1115
01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:41.829
If I find out

1116
01:15:41.996 --> 01:15:44.040

to do with this. Stefan.

1117

I still can't believe it.

1119
01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:21.953
None of us can. my friend.

1120
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.789
I never thought I'd be so happy
to be imprisoned. Lowy.

the safest Pesach
