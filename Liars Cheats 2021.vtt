3
00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.292
What time is it?

4
00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:20.292
I don't know. I just go by the sun.

5
00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:23.083
Well... I go by my phone.

6
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.250
You know what would be great right now?

7
00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:27.167
If only I could find the bloody thing...

8
00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.000
A matcha latte.

9
00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:32.000
Tell me I didn't lose it.
Tell me I didn't lose my phone.

10
00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.250
What about that cafÃ© across the street?

11
00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:35.625
You think they have it?

12
00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:37.625
Why? Did you leave it there?

13
00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:39.333
I don't know. you said it!

14
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.333
It's The Tea House right?

15
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.458
No!

16
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.250
Are you sure? It sounds right.

17
00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.000
It's The Coffee House. okay.

18
00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:48.875
And I'd be very surprised
if they have matcha lattes. In fact...

19
00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:50.625
They definitely don't do matcha lattes.

20
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:53.875
Guarantee it.
I hundred percent guarantee it.

21
00:04:54.042 --> 00:04:59.833
The Tea House. Best matcha lattes
in Notting Hill. Fifty six reviews.

22
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.333
I just need to find my phone.

23
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.167
Can you get me one please?

24
00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:04.917
Look. just a sec.

25
00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:06.125
It's only across the street.

26
00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:09.250
I think you can manage two minutes
without Google Maps.

27
00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:12.167
How about I make us some breakfast?
That's something I can get behind.

28
00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:14.167
It's too early for breakfast.

29
00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.167
What do you mean. "it's too early for
breakfast?" That's impossible.

30
00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:21.417
It's not good to eat a meal
within thirty minutes of waking up.

31
00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:25.250
Y'know. you seem so laid back
on the surface. but actually...

32
00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:26.542
You're quite persistent.

33
00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:29.250
Well thank you.
That's one of my three energy stars.

34
00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:30.958
It wasn't a compliment.

35
00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:33.042
It got me here didn't it?

36
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:37.042
Aren't you going to ask me
about my other energy stars?

37
00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:39.458
I don't do astronomy.

38
00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:41.875
They're understanding and compassion.

39
00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:43.125
Those are the same thing!

40
00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:48.125
Of course they're not. Understanding
is knowing. compassion is feeling.

41
00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:50.292
You should know that.
aren't you an actor?

42
00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:54.500
Didn't you see my last three films?
I don't think I've acted in years.

43
00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:57.083
I don't watch movies.

44
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.292
I just stand in front of a green wall
and I repeat line after terrible line.

45
00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:03.458
until my stunt double takes over.

46
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.333
I do that. day after day after day.
Honestly. a monkey could do my job.

47
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.333
Oooh. check this out!

48
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.250
"Once saw Max Peters here...

49
00:06:13.417 --> 00:06:17.458
He ordered a skinny cappuccino and
was wearing the tightest little jeans.

50
00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:19.833
Such a hottie!"

51
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.875
I don't order cappuccinos.

52
00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:23.333
Well. she says you did.

53
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.458
And I say. I don't.

54
00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:27.042
Why would she lie?

55
00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:29.250
Because that's what the internet is.

56
00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:34.500
It's built on lies. even the term web
of lies comes from the World Wide Web.

57
00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:35.833
You should look it up.

58
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.042
You sound really old
when you say things like that.

59
00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:43.375
So that's one matcha latte?

60
00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:46.458
Yes. please!
And a banana-nut-sugar-free muffin.

61
00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:49.125
I thought you said
it was too early for breakfast?

62
00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:51.417
Muffins don't count.

63
00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:54.500
Do you want me to come with?

64
00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:57.042
No. I'll be back in a sec.
You stay here.

65
00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.458
The last thing I need is more attention.

66
00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:05.417
Shit.

67
00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:12.792
Hello?

68
00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.667
Max! Don't leave your apartment. I'll be
there in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

69
00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:17.833
What the hell is going on?

70
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.333
In exactly ten seconds I want you
to open the door to me and only me.

71
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.458
Ten. nine. eight. sev -

72
00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:25.667
Shit.

73
00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:26.833
Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

74
00:07:30.042 --> 00:07:32.667
Blow it out your ass. Cindy!

75
00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:40.500
Maxie. Maxie. Don't worry.
everything's gonna be alright.

76
00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:46.583
Come here. I'm gonna make it all better.
alright? Don't panic. don't panic.

77
00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:50.042
I'm here to help!
Where's your phone. sweetie?

78
00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:52.792
It's dead.

79
00:07:58.083 --> 00:07:59.125
What the fuck are you doing?

80
00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:02.083
What is the one thing I always told you?

81
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.875
The one thing I drilled into that tiny.
little. beautiful brain of yours?

82
00:08:07.042 --> 00:08:08.333
Don't talk politics?

83
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.458
Never take naked photos!
Unless you consult me first.

84
00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:13.792
Thanks to your utter stupidity.

85
00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:17.083
the whole world is getting
a front row seat to your shvonson.

86
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.250
Wide shots. medium shots.
and you betcha.

87
00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:26.375
an award-winning close-up
that would make doves cry.

88
00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:29.458
- Oh no.
- I think we found your best angle.

89
00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:31.083
How is this possible?

90
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.083
You got hacked! Consider it a compliment.
people care what you do.

91
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.917
Say goodbye to privacy.

92
00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:41.417
- I need a coffee.
- What. this didn't wake you up?

93
00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:43.250
I wanna see if I'm still dreaming.

94
00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:46.250
If you were dreaming.
I'd be twenty years younger.

95
00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:51.167
and wearing a teenie weenie
polka dot bikini. Sadly. you're awake.

96
00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:54.167
But hey. look.
so far we can contain this.

97
00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.125
There really is no bad publicity.

98
00:08:56.292 --> 00:08:58.375
Great! It's not working.

99
00:08:58.542 --> 00:09:01.875
But boy do we need
to get ahead of this information...

100
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.125
The one day I wanna use it!

101
00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:04.417
We'll figure something out. Now listen--

102
00:09:04.583 --> 00:09:06.250
These bastards aren't gonna
get away with this!

103
00:09:06.417 --> 00:09:11.208
Maxie! Forget about the coffee.
Tell me what I need to know.

104
00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:12.375
Tell you what?

105
00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:13.917
All of it. And quick.

106
00:09:14.083 --> 00:09:15.417
It's already out.

107
00:09:15.583 --> 00:09:16.833
Is it?

108
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.167
What? My cock plastered all over
the tabloids isn't enough for you?

109
00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:24.250
Do you realize how delicate
this situation is?

110
00:09:24.417 --> 00:09:29.125
I mean. I mean. one wrong move
and you're a flash in the pan.

111
00:09:30.292 --> 00:09:33.167
Maxie? Maxie? Who's Maxie? Y'know!

112
00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:36.125
No more magazine covers.
no more first class travel...

113
00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:38.958
No more love from your adoring fans.

114
00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:40.917
Look. nobody's perfect. Maxie.
not even you.

115
00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:45.875
So if there is anything you need
to tell me... now is the time.

116
00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:48.792
Luce. there's nothing more to tell.

117
00:09:48.958 --> 00:09:51.042
Max. what's your wifi?

118
00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:53.458
Who the fuck is this?

119
00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:58.167
- Who the fuck are you?
- I am Peaches.

120
00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:00.500
Oh. you're Peaches.
She's Peaches. Max.

121
00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:02.917
- I was just getting to that.
- What? Slipped your mind?

122
00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:05.333
When I ask you
if you have anything else to tell me.

123
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.500
I expect Peaches
to be at the top of the fucking list!

124
00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:13.083
Now. for the last goddamn time.
who the fuck is Peaches?

125
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.208
She's a friend.

126
00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:17.792
- Good friend. I bet.
- We met last night.

127
00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:21.833
And here you are in the morning...
the circle of life.

128
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.250
I will just get an Uber.

129
00:10:23.417 --> 00:10:24.875
You're not going anywhere!

130
00:10:25.042 --> 00:10:26.375
What are you doing? Hey!

131
00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:27.750
It's for your own good!

132
00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:29.250
Max! Do something!

133
00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:30.833
He's done enough!

134
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.292
What's wrong with you?
This is kidnapping!

135
00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:36.625
You stay put. you hear me.
You're on my shit list.

136
00:10:36.792 --> 00:10:38.167
What is she. fifteen?

137
00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:41.083
She happens to have three energy stars.

138
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.458
Stupid!

139
00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:52.208
Fuck you!

140
00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:54.333
Kids. Am I right?

141
00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:02.833
Hey! Not inside.

142
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.083
Well do you have any vodka at least?

143
00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.083
It's nine thirty in the morning.

144
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.000
Exactly. It's too early for this shit.

145
00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:17.042
- What the hell is that?
- Sophia bought it for me.

146
00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:19.625
Well. get rid of it already!

147
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.375
Hey. Luce. There's something
I've been meaning to talk to you about.

148
00:11:31.542 --> 00:11:33.458
Yeah. I'm a little busy. Max.

149
00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:36.000
It's this new project
I've been working on.

150
00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:41.250
Hm-hm. one problem at a time. sweetie.
Mommy needs her medicine.

151
00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:47.958
We need to keep an eye
on that girl. That a...

152
00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:49.208
Peaches.

153
00:11:51.042 --> 00:11:52.417
How do you know
she's not some crazy fan. y'know?

154
00:11:52.583 --> 00:11:55.083
You meet her last night.
this kicks off in the morning.

155
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.792
She doesn't even watch movies.

156
00:11:56.958 --> 00:12:03.083
Look. look. Sleeping in your bushes.
Waiting day and night and then pounce!

157
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.083
She's practically a Buddhist.

158
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.333
Nah. I'm not taking any chances.

159
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.750
From now on. this apartment
is on total fucking lockdown.

160
00:12:11.917 --> 00:12:14.500
- Max! How could they?

161
00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:18.000
Trying to destroy you
with this. this garbage!

162
00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:20.083
- Just come right in. Magda.

163
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.792
Don't look so glum.

164
00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:28.750
Head up. shoulders straight.
posture makes perfect.

165
00:12:28.917 --> 00:12:30.250
Relax. It'll be fine. Magda.

166
00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.458
Fine!? Don't be blind.

167
00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:37.167
You never walk away from something
like this. It could ruin you!

168
00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:38.917
People will forget this by lunchtime.

169
00:12:39.583 --> 00:12:42.583
People don't forget. People never forget.

170
00:12:43.542 --> 00:12:49.667
Vultures! Every last one.
Vultures. vultures. vultures.

171
00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:53.375
Did I give you keys?

172
00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:55.042
No.

173
00:12:57.125 --> 00:12:58.208
Timothy did.

174
00:12:58.375 --> 00:12:59.500
Speak of the devil!

175
00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:02.875
Casper the not-so-friendly manager
should be here any minute.

176
00:13:03.042 --> 00:13:08.417
You look pale. are you sure
you're alright? Doesn't he look pale?

177
00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:12.125
Magda! The boy can handle
a little dick pick.

178
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:17.958
What dick pick? There was a dick pick?
Oh. you naughty boy!

179
00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:21.875
Whoa. whoa. whoa. wait!
What did you see?

180
00:13:23.208 --> 00:13:25.750
A homophobic and racist rant.

181
00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:28.333
You gotta be kidding me.

182
00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:32.333
I've got it here.

183
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.333
Something about the gays
and a large group of black people.

184
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.458
Just a moment!

185
00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:51.042
Can I?

186
00:14:07.042 --> 00:14:10.833
No. This is a recipe for plum tart.

187
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.458
It's very good actually.
shall I sent it on?

188
00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:17.000
Maybe later. Magda.

189
00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:19.125
Okay. found it!

190
00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:25.250
Max write. "What's up tonight?"

191
00:14:25.417 --> 00:14:28.417
Shane says.
"Going to my gay boss' wedding."

192
00:14:29.417 --> 00:14:34.125
Max writes. "A party full of gay people.
that should be fun."

193
00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:39.292
Shane... "At least it's not full
of black people!"

194
00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:42.875
Hold on. I'm the good guy there!
I'm the good guy. I'm not racist!

195
00:14:43.042 --> 00:14:45.000
Then you said "Ha."

196
00:14:45.167 --> 00:14:50.000
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
You said "Ha"? He said "Ha"?

197
00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:55.000
Hm-hm. Then he wrote two smiley faces
and a black person emoji.

198
00:14:55.167 --> 00:14:57.167
Jesus Fucking Christ. Max!

199
00:14:57.333 --> 00:14:59.250
Oh. c'mon. I've seen you write
a thousand worse things.

200
00:14:59.417 --> 00:15:03.792
We all have. but you got caught!
So c'mon. out with it. I need it all.

201
00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:06.667
You want a detailed account
of everything on my phone?

202
00:15:07.125 --> 00:15:10.500
Well. sorry. Luce. you fucking broke it!

203
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.208
You broke his phone?

204
00:15:14.375 --> 00:15:15.500
Your computer!

205
00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:17.875
Don't you touch my computer!

206
00:15:18.042 --> 00:15:24.792
I'll touch what I like!
Fuck. Maxie. what's your password?

207
00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:26.208
I'm not comfortable with this.

208
00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:29.333
Great. Now you decide to keep quiet.

209
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.000
Don't blame him!
It's not his fault this happened.

210
00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:36.375
Well. who am I supposed to blame?

211
00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:40.917
Sophia.

212
00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:42.917
Sophia!

213
00:15:43.083 --> 00:15:46.833
Could we please not talk about her?
Today's depressing enough already.

214
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.292
The crazy ex. It's always the crazy ex.

215
00:15:51.292 --> 00:15:57.083
Ever since we broke up... I can't sleep.
I can't work. It's been really tough.

216
00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.208
Oh buck up. you big pussy.

217
00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:03.125
Hey! Thanks. Luce.
I thought you were my friend!

218
00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:05.250
Fuck no. I'm your publicist.

219
00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:07.375
I'm your friend. Max.

220
00:16:07.542 --> 00:16:10.333
- Thanks. Magda.
- How could we not see this earlier?

221
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.375
I mean she's a supermodel.
for god's sake! Way to drop the ball.

222
00:16:14.542 --> 00:16:16.458
I've been a little upset.

223
00:16:16.625 --> 00:16:19.792
Well take a Xanax and wake up!

224
00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:23.292
Sophia knows everything about you.

225
00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:25.167
- And she hates him!
- And she hates you!

226
00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:27.500
- She doesn't hate me!
- She does!

227
00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:29.000
I'm still not over her. y'know.

228
00:16:29.167 --> 00:16:31.250
You should be.

229
00:16:31.417 --> 00:16:34.417
Why'd you break up with her again?

230
00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:35.500
What does that matter?

231
00:16:35.667 --> 00:16:40.083
It matters! We're trying to figure out
if Sophia has a reason to be mad!

232
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:42.042
So c'mon. why'd you break up?

233
00:16:42.208 --> 00:16:45.875
People break up. we broke up.
I don't know.

234
00:16:46.042 --> 00:16:47.250
What do you mean. you don't know?

235
00:16:47.417 --> 00:16:50.250
It was. it was just so many things.

236
00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:53.583
Think. Max! This is important.

237
00:16:54.125 --> 00:17:00.500
Is there any reason why Sophia might be
just a little bit upset with you?

238
00:17:05.167 --> 00:17:10.500
I mean. it's probably nothing. But...

239
00:17:12.375 --> 00:17:13.875
I may have cheated on her.

240
00:17:14.042 --> 00:17:16.167
- You asshole.
- How could you?

241
00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:18.583
- Look. it was just one time!
- You think you know a guy!

242
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.458
You never told me you cheated.
He never told me.

243
00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:27.125
- That poor girl.
- Poor girl? A second ago she was poison.

244
00:17:27.292 --> 00:17:29.833
I should call her.
Give me her number.

245
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.083
No one is calling Sophia!

246
00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.250
That's rich. Coming from a cheat.

247
00:17:34.417 --> 00:17:38.083
Did you ever stop to think how she might
feel? I mean on a humiliation scale?

248
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.042
I feel awful. okay.

249
00:17:40.208 --> 00:17:44.250
You just wait! Cause it's gonna get
a whole lot worse.

250
00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:47.500
Yeah. first it's just a few images.
a few tweets. then it's your...

251
00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:52.417
Character. your livelihood.
it's all going down the drain. baby!

252
00:17:52.583 --> 00:17:56.250
This is not gonna go away
like a fart in the wind. Oh. no.

253
00:17:56.917 --> 00:18:00.250
Sophia is not gonna quit
until she's embarrassed you...

254
00:18:00.417 --> 00:18:02.542
Like you've embarrassed her.

255
00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:08.208
- Max?
- Oh. no.

256
00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:10.208
What?

257
00:18:11.958 --> 00:18:17.458
Wh-what is it? Kissing?
People kiss! So what. right?

258
00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:19.250
Yes! People kiss.

259
00:18:19.417 --> 00:18:21.417
Yeah.

260
00:18:21.583 --> 00:18:23.042
Max?

261
00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:27.000
Max. is it?

262
00:18:29.292 --> 00:18:32.500
Is it more than kissing?
Is it... touching?

263
00:18:32.667 --> 00:18:38.667
Are you... touching each other?
Are you touching yourself?

264
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.583
- We're touching.
- You son of a bitch!

265
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.958
What did I tell you?
Never fucking film fucking!

266
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.458
Pull yourself together!

267
00:18:55.625 --> 00:18:58.958
I'm alright! It's okay!
It's okay. it's alright.

268
00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:11.000
- What is it? Are we screwed?

269
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:16.083
- No. Just another racist rant.
- Okay.

270
00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:21.333
Spread your legs. cause I'm coming in.

271
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.125
Doesn't anyone knock anymore?

272
00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:25.375
Thank god!

273
00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:31.417
Lucille. darling!
Still ravishing enough to eat.

274
00:19:32.458 --> 00:19:34.042
Magda.

275
00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:41.458
Maxie the man of the hour!
How are you holding up boy? Huh?

276
00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:44.458
I hope you're making good use
of this one's tongue...

277
00:19:44.625 --> 00:19:48.375
After all. that's what we pay her for!

278
00:19:48.542 --> 00:19:50.292
Did you give Magda my keys?

279
00:19:50.458 --> 00:19:54.417
Whatever these two old hags
have been telling you is nonsense.

280
00:19:54.583 --> 00:19:59.417
We'll ride past this. just something
to laugh about over a good pint.

281
00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:06.042
I've seen a thousand scandals.
and I've beat them all!

282
00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:12.750
- There's a fucking sex tape.
- Nailed it.

283
00:20:12.917 --> 00:20:17.375
That bitch! I knew it was Sophia.
didn't I warn you. boy. didn't I?

284
00:20:17.542 --> 00:20:19.833
He cheated on her...

285
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.958
Oh boy! You're in for it now.

286
00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:29.167
- Sorry. gotta take this.
-

287
00:20:45.208 --> 00:20:47.583
Yeah. And fuck off!

288
00:20:48.458 --> 00:20:50.000
Oh boy...

289
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.625
Do you have a...
do you have any whisky. boy? Huh?

290
00:21:01.417 --> 00:21:08.458
Magda? Magda be a dear. Put those hands
to good use. my neck is killing me.

291
00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:10.750
How is this?

292
00:21:10.917 --> 00:21:12.458
Oh Magda.

293
00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:16.917
Whatever's got into you. I like it!

294
00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:19.083
Your whisky.

295
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:26.167
Oh god. thanks. Maxie.
Oh. what is that?

296
00:21:26.333 --> 00:21:30.083
- Sophia gave it to me.
- Yeah. makes sense.

297
00:21:31.958 --> 00:21:34.292
Come here. boy.

298
00:21:35.333 --> 00:21:38.458
Fucking Sophia. huh.

299
00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:43.958
Mind you. I can't blame you.
She was a firecracker.

300
00:21:46.917 --> 00:21:49.833
You know we never. ah...

301
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.125
I know.

302
00:21:53.042 --> 00:21:56.917
She tried it once. but I...
I turned her down gently.

303
00:21:57.083 --> 00:22:01.000
- Monkeyballs! He's trending.

304
00:22:02.292 --> 00:22:03.250
What is it?

305
00:22:03.417 --> 00:22:06.917
- Max Peters is a fascist!
- Seriously?

306
00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:11.417
Look. Someone posted a picture of Max
in a Nazi uniform.

307
00:22:11.583 --> 00:22:12.875
Well. that's pushing it.

308
00:22:13.042 --> 00:22:16.958
They even gave him
a little Hitler moustache.

309
00:22:17.125 --> 00:22:19.167
And Sharon Stone just retweeted it.

310
00:22:20.333 --> 00:22:27.083
Hashtag Max Peters is fascist. Hashtag
tear his face off. Hashtag... giant ass?

311
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.875
This one is him as Castro.

312
00:22:29.042 --> 00:22:31.042
Of course it is!

313
00:22:31.208 --> 00:22:35.000
Y'know. Castro was a communist.

314
00:22:35.167 --> 00:22:36.833
We need something new.

315
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.458
It won't be long.

316
00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:40.875
- I just got another one!

317
00:22:41.042 --> 00:22:44.417
No. Magda. we need something new
on someone else!

318
00:22:44.583 --> 00:22:47.208
If we have to take the dirt.
we might as well dish it.

319
00:22:47.375 --> 00:22:49.750
Beat them at their own game.

320
00:22:49.917 --> 00:22:55.083
Look at your two. Thick as thieves.
A real Bonnie and Clyde.

321
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.833
What can I say. Magda?
When I'm good. I'm very good.

322
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.708
And when I'm bad... Oooh. I'm better.

323
00:23:03.542 --> 00:23:06.250
So. Luce... what's the play?

324
00:23:06.417 --> 00:23:08.333
We start a chum line.

325
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.542
Oh. fresh meat. I like it!

326
00:23:12.708 --> 00:23:17.250
Yeah. what we need is someone
simply reprehensible.

327
00:23:17.417 --> 00:23:21.125
A disgusting and deplorable
sexual deviant...

328
00:23:21.292 --> 00:23:27.208
Who's very mention makes the skin
crawl of every women in his presence!

329
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.083
Oh please.

330
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:40.833
I need three Viagras just to get it up.
Nobody gives a rat's ass about me.

331
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.500
I couldn't agree more.

332
00:23:43.667 --> 00:23:46.458
How about that guy at the BBC
always pinching bums?

333
00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.042
Not a chance.

334
00:23:48.208 --> 00:23:49.875
Well everybody knows about...

335
00:23:50.042 --> 00:23:52.625
Oh sure. sure. but he's untouchable.

336
00:23:53.583 --> 00:23:54.792
How about...

337
00:23:56.292 --> 00:23:57.458
He's dead.

338
00:23:58.125 --> 00:23:59.500
Fucker!

339
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.292
Well. I guess we'll just have
to make something up.

340
00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:04.250
Well. who do you have in mind?

341
00:24:04.417 --> 00:24:07.958
- George Clooney!
-

342
00:24:10.042 --> 00:24:12.792
Stories are only good
if people believe them. Max.

343
00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:14.458
Ok. fine. fine.

344
00:24:15.958 --> 00:24:18.083
- Brad...
- Don't say Pitt--

345
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.417
- Ley...
- Don't say Cooper--

346
00:24:21.083 --> 00:24:22.250
Hugh Grant!

347
00:24:22.417 --> 00:24:25.250
He's a fucking client. you moron!

348
00:24:25.417 --> 00:24:27.250
Maxie. Why don't you just
go make some tea?

349
00:24:27.417 --> 00:24:28.625
Two sugars.

350
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.667
And a dash of gin.

351
00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:33.250
Tequila for me.

352
00:24:34.042 --> 00:24:39.292
Y'know. we could. lean into this.
Pull a Kardashian.

353
00:24:39.458 --> 00:24:41.833
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

354
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.292
- Aloha.
- Darling. come in. come in.

355
00:24:45.458 --> 00:24:48.042
Really? You gave Olya keys too?

356
00:24:48.208 --> 00:24:51.875
Cheer up. One of these scripts
will be your next franchise!

357
00:24:52.042 --> 00:24:55.083
Everyone in London is here!
Whatever happened to privacy?

358
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.792
It jumped out of your trousers
at nine thirty this morning. pretty boy!

359
00:24:58.958 --> 00:25:00.125
Here's your stimulant.

360
00:25:00.292 --> 00:25:01.500
Oh thank you.

361
00:25:03.083 --> 00:25:09.500
I don't know what I want to drink more.
This latte... or you?

362
00:25:09.667 --> 00:25:11.917
Are you really gonna take that?

363
00:25:12.083 --> 00:25:14.083
I pee in his coffee.

364
00:25:16.083 --> 00:25:17.625
Oh thatta girl.

365
00:25:19.042 --> 00:25:20.417
Hey. Olya.

366
00:25:22.458 --> 00:25:25.917
I really like what you've done
with the place.

367
00:25:26.083 --> 00:25:29.958
It has a great energy. Very relaxing.

368
00:25:30.458 --> 00:25:35.583
Very... mantra-centric. Very Kurosawa.

369
00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:38.417
Yeah. not today it isn't.

370
00:25:39.667 --> 00:25:43.083
Not today. But still...

371
00:25:44.167 --> 00:25:46.583
I can feel it.

372
00:25:51.417 --> 00:25:54.458
Can I... do anything?

373
00:25:54.625 --> 00:25:59.167
Actually. I would love a coffee.

374
00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:01.542
I meant spiritually. Max.

375
00:26:04.375 --> 00:26:07.417
Spiritually I'm... I'm okay.

376
00:26:09.375 --> 00:26:11.583
Are you?

377
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:18.250
Hands off.
Get your own fucking assistant!

378
00:26:18.417 --> 00:26:20.958
Coffee isn't good for you anyway. Max.

379
00:26:21.125 --> 00:26:26.042
It encourages stress
and tension in the body.

380
00:26:26.208 --> 00:26:30.042
You need to root yourself...

381
00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:34.458
Immediately.

382
00:26:34.625 --> 00:26:36.583
Would you listen to them?

383
00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.917
You clearly can't wait
to rip each other's clothes off.

384
00:26:42.083 --> 00:26:45.750
Lips to lips. flesh to flesh.

385
00:26:45.917 --> 00:26:50.750
Max is decently attractive.
but I don't date actors.

386
00:26:50.917 --> 00:26:54.667
Why? What's wrong with actors?

387
00:26:56.167 --> 00:27:00.625
They're self-obsessed. insecure pods
who take their emotions out on...

388
00:27:01.083 --> 00:27:03.042
Whoever's closest.

389
00:27:03.208 --> 00:27:07.958
And they're vain. Very vain.
And I get it. you have to be.

390
00:27:08.125 --> 00:27:11.750
Your job is based
on your face. your hair.

391
00:27:11.917 --> 00:27:16.292
your skin. your voice.

392
00:27:16.458 --> 00:27:18.000
It's very fragile.

393
00:27:19.292 --> 00:27:26.042
Your career. your beauty. your teeth...

394
00:27:27.042 --> 00:27:30.375
Could all fall away at any moment.

395
00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:35.750
Thanks. Olya. that will be all.

396
00:27:35.917 --> 00:27:38.083
Make sure you walk Mindy before lunch.

397
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:41.250
She can be a right old bitch
when she's hungry.

398
00:27:41.417 --> 00:27:43.417
Yeah. well look at her owner.

399
00:27:44.292 --> 00:27:45.250
Namaste.

400
00:27:45.417 --> 00:27:46.458
Namaste.

401
00:27:48.417 --> 00:27:50.000
Namaste.

402
00:27:51.167 --> 00:27:54.875
God. she is such a dick.

403
00:27:55.042 --> 00:27:57.500
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

404
00:27:57.667 --> 00:28:00.083
Well. in my book it is.

405
00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.000
In your book?

406
00:28:03.042 --> 00:28:04.625
Would you like some tea. Magda?

407
00:28:05.375 --> 00:28:09.833
None for me. Max. I'm not staying long.

408
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.042
- I want no part of this.
-

409
00:28:13.208 --> 00:28:17.833
Coulda fooled me. The way you barged
in here like a dump truck on fire.

410
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.333
I'm here for moral support.

411
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.208
Oh you are. huh?

412
00:28:23.375 --> 00:28:26.917
She said moral. you twit.

413
00:28:27.917 --> 00:28:30.125
I'm going to the bathroom.

414
00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:33.417
And the time is nine forty six.

415
00:28:33.583 --> 00:28:35.042
And?

416
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.292
Nothing.

417
00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:43.250
Except everyone will mark the moment
you went into the toilet.

418
00:28:44.042 --> 00:28:46.458
The clock. it is ticking.

419
00:28:47.417 --> 00:28:53.875
Fine! I'll just wait.
Sorry if it ruins your sick game.

420
00:28:54.042 --> 00:28:58.625
Oh Magda. don't worry one bit.
You're playing splendidly!

421
00:29:05.375 --> 00:29:09.083
Such a beautiful language.

422
00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.083
No one curses like the French.

423
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.167
The English aren't too bad.

424
00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:21.167
Yeah. sure. sure.
But after cunt. it really goes downhill.

425
00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:22.833
What about knob?

426
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.500
Please. What are you. ten?

427
00:29:25.667 --> 00:29:28.083
I quite like. twat.

428
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.500
Hm! Good. Very effective.

429
00:29:31.667 --> 00:29:34.167
Yes. I suppose.

430
00:29:34.333 --> 00:29:38.917
But nothing beats a good solid fuck.

431
00:29:39.083 --> 00:29:40.208
Fuckster.

432
00:29:40.375 --> 00:29:42.875
Fuckery. Fuckity fuck fuck!

433
00:29:43.042 --> 00:29:45.792
Oui! Fuck you. cocksucker!

434
00:29:45.958 --> 00:29:46.917
Fuck nugget.

435
00:29:47.083 --> 00:29:48.750
- Motherfucker!
- Fuck face.

436
00:29:48.917 --> 00:29:50.958
Head fucker!

437
00:29:52.417 --> 00:29:54.375
Fuck you!

438
00:29:55.375 --> 00:29:57.167
I'm walkin' here.

439
00:29:58.042 --> 00:30:01.917
And what the fuck was that?

440
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:05.250
Are you talkin to me?
Are you talkin to me. because...

441
00:30:05.417 --> 00:30:07.958
There's no one else here. It's just me.

442
00:30:08.125 --> 00:30:10.833
Oh god...

443
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.250
No wonder he didn't get
the bloody Scorsese film.

444
00:30:15.333 --> 00:30:19.250
You're the one who wouldn't pay
for dialect coaching. I told you.

445
00:30:19.417 --> 00:30:24.042
He's already got a coach!
You want another one. you pay for it.

446
00:30:24.208 --> 00:30:26.833
Oh come on. Don't be so cheap.

447
00:30:29.667 --> 00:30:34.750
Like I'm gonna listen
to some washed-up acting coach.

448
00:30:34.917 --> 00:30:37.583
In my days. Timothy.

449
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:43.417
I was one
of the greatest actresses in Paris.

450
00:30:47.083 --> 00:30:50.500
How much is that past glory
costing me per hour?

451
00:30:50.667 --> 00:30:52.167
Please.

452
00:30:52.333 --> 00:30:55.000
You can't put a price on talent.

453
00:30:55.167 --> 00:30:56.208
Oh really?

454
00:30:57.417 --> 00:31:00.250
Cause that's exactly what I do.

455
00:31:03.958 --> 00:31:08.083
And the time is nine fifty.
It's almost too easy!

456
00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.208
- What?

457
00:31:11.542 --> 00:31:14.125
- What is it?
- A mouse just scurried by.

458
00:31:14.292 --> 00:31:16.000
A mouse? I've never seen a mouse--

459
00:31:18.167 --> 00:31:21.250
- That's no mouse.

460
00:31:22.167 --> 00:31:25.458
Not so fast. you bloody reporters!

461
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.792
You're gonna have to do a lot better
than that. Is that what you want. huh?

462
00:31:32.958 --> 00:31:34.292
The inside scoop?

463
00:31:34.458 --> 00:31:39.583
Well go ahead and take a closer look.
you cum-guzzling fucks!

464
00:31:48.542 --> 00:31:50.250
Well. that oughta teach 'em.

465
00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:53.250
-

466
00:31:53.417 --> 00:31:56.458
- Oh. you idiot. you.
- What. is it something I said?

467
00:31:56.625 --> 00:31:58.208
Not you. You!

468
00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:00.042
Oh God. what is it now?

469
00:32:01.458 --> 00:32:04.625
Well. pretty boy.
don't keep us in suspense!

470
00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:08.292
How did your cock
cock it up this time?

471
00:32:09.208 --> 00:32:11.500
- They've got my emails.
- All your emails?

472
00:32:13.667 --> 00:32:15.250
Just his personal.

473
00:32:15.417 --> 00:32:17.917
Oh yeah!
Just my personal email account.

474
00:32:18.083 --> 00:32:21.250
With my very personal.
very private emails on it.

475
00:32:21.417 --> 00:32:23.625
Oh thank goodness.
you had me worried there.

476
00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:27.250
So how about that tea. Maxie boy?

477
00:32:27.417 --> 00:32:30.000
Get your own fucking tea.

478
00:32:36.333 --> 00:32:40.417
Maxie boy. Come closer.

479
00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:43.375
Listen.

480
00:32:44.667 --> 00:32:47.083
Listen carefully.

481
00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:54.292
It's bubbling Maxie boy.
Bubbling just for you.

482
00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:01.250
It's the sound of the primordial ooze
from which all life was created.

483
00:33:02.417 --> 00:33:07.250
From that ooze. crawled thousands.
millions of creatures...

484
00:33:07.417 --> 00:33:11.417
Crawling on their bellies
like giant parasites.

485
00:33:12.625 --> 00:33:16.667
But not all were created equal.
No. No.

486
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.958
Some. were meant for greatness.

487
00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:27.417
And those select few stood up...
and walked.

488
00:33:27.583 --> 00:33:31.292
Rising above the putrid ground below...

489
00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:35.875
Ready to seize the Earth
with an iron first.

490
00:33:36.042 --> 00:33:41.292
And I. I. Maxie boy. am a caveman!

491
00:33:41.458 --> 00:33:45.625
And I don't get my own fucking tea!!

492
00:33:51.417 --> 00:33:52.958
Do you take sugar?

493
00:33:54.417 --> 00:33:57.083
No.

494
00:34:06.208 --> 00:34:10.500
Please be Russell Crowe
naked in Times Square.

495
00:34:10.667 --> 00:34:12.042
It's your office...

496
00:34:13.042 --> 00:34:14.167
Hey. Jeannie.

497
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.042
No! No. no don't--

498
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.167
Mum. hi!
Mum. of course I was gonna call.

499
00:34:19.333 --> 00:34:23.917
Mum. I wanted to call. it's just been a--
it's been a really hectic morning.

500
00:34:24.417 --> 00:34:26.167
I know it's been hectic for you too.

501
00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:28.958
Oh. even worse.

502
00:34:29.125 --> 00:34:31.458
No. no. that wasn't sarcastic.

503
00:34:32.417 --> 00:34:34.583
Hi. Dad. I wasn't yelling.

504
00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:38.250
I know she's upset.
but how is that my fault?

505
00:34:38.417 --> 00:34:41.125
I. I wasn't yelling!

506
00:34:41.292 --> 00:34:42.292
What?

507
00:34:42.458 --> 00:34:45.458
Oh. oh yeah. mum! Yeah. yeah. yeah.
it's a sign from God!

508
00:34:45.625 --> 00:34:48.208
Not one leaked email to my parents!

509
00:34:48.375 --> 00:34:49.458
Yes!

510
00:34:49.625 --> 00:34:53.583
Yes. I got your gingersnaps.
they were delicious!

511
00:35:17.125 --> 00:35:19.542
I got a yacht. you know?

512
00:35:20.333 --> 00:35:21.917
In Nice.

513
00:35:23.292 --> 00:35:26.667
Cost me four mil. and then some.

514
00:35:28.667 --> 00:35:32.375
Rosewood gloss. a tiki bar.

515
00:35:32.542 --> 00:35:36.208
and a steward who fucks
like a cheetah.

516
00:35:37.917 --> 00:35:39.417
So what?

517
00:35:40.583 --> 00:35:42.458
So I'm here. aren't I?

518
00:35:43.417 --> 00:35:48.083
I'm here. of all places!
And you know why?

519
00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:53.625
Because I'm trying to help you!
Believe it or not.

520
00:36:01.583 --> 00:36:05.042
Sophia really has it in for him.

521
00:36:05.208 --> 00:36:06.792
If it was even her?

522
00:36:06.958 --> 00:36:08.875
I thought we agreed it was.

523
00:36:09.042 --> 00:36:13.083
Look. I just think at this point let's
keep an open mind. It could be anyone.

524
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.375
Anyone?

525
00:36:15.958 --> 00:36:17.625
In this room?

526
00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:24.125
Well. uh. Timothy.
You're not exactly a boy scout.

527
00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:31.167
Please. What reasons would I have?

528
00:36:33.042 --> 00:36:35.250
You're always grooming
some hot young thing.

529
00:36:35.417 --> 00:36:37.958
How do we know
you're not tearing Maxie down

530
00:36:38.125 --> 00:36:40.458
just in order to replace him
with a newer model?

531
00:36:40.625 --> 00:36:44.000
Sporting a higher price tag. no doubt!

532
00:36:44.167 --> 00:36:48.625
Oh that is fresh.
That is fresh coming from you.

533
00:36:49.917 --> 00:36:53.792
Let's not forget
who the real puppet master is!

534
00:36:53.958 --> 00:36:56.500
- Please--
- Anything for a little bit of attention!

535
00:36:56.667 --> 00:36:57.750
Right. Luce?

536
00:36:57.917 --> 00:37:02.375
I bet you watch that video
on a fucking loop. you dirty whore!

537
00:37:02.542 --> 00:37:05.167
Timothy! Come on.

538
00:37:05.333 --> 00:37:07.083
You're right. you're right.

539
00:37:08.667 --> 00:37:10.750
We haven't even considered Magda!

540
00:37:10.917 --> 00:37:12.042
That's out of line.

541
00:37:12.208 --> 00:37:13.500
Is it?

542
00:37:14.958 --> 00:37:16.375
I can see her.

543
00:37:16.542 --> 00:37:20.458
Longing for the days
when she was young.

544
00:37:20.625 --> 00:37:25.833
and pretty. and... talented!

545
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.875
Maxie's on the way up. and she can't
handle it. Can you. Magda?

546
00:37:31.042 --> 00:37:35.667
That... is... enough.

547
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.042
- Dirty girl.
- Lush.

548
00:37:45.208 --> 00:37:46.208
- Hussy!
- Perv!

549
00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:49.333
Yes. please!

550
00:38:03.958 --> 00:38:06.542
BBC news has just received
exclusive footage

551
00:38:06.708 --> 00:38:08.958
from inside Max Peter's apartment.

552
00:38:09.125 --> 00:38:11.167
A warning if you have
young children present.

553
00:38:11.333 --> 00:38:15.333
this video contains coarse language
and partial nudity.

554
00:38:16.333 --> 00:38:23.167
You're gonna have to do a lot better
than that. Is that what you want. huh?

555
00:38:23.333 --> 00:38:24.917
The inside scoop?

556
00:38:25.083 --> 00:38:30.042
Well go ahead and take a closer look.
you !

557
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.792
Mr Fine was not available for comment.

558
00:38:37.958 --> 00:38:40.250
- Ah. the good ol' Beeb.
-

559
00:38:40.417 --> 00:38:44.500
Ooh God.
Oh. Kate's really let herself go.

560
00:38:44.667 --> 00:38:48.000
- Winslet?
- No. no. Middleton.

561
00:38:48.167 --> 00:38:52.458
Y'know. I never could get
the whole point of royalty.

562
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.042
It's like being a star
without any of the fun.

563
00:38:57.208 --> 00:39:00.292
Give me some Harry. any day.

564
00:39:01.375 --> 00:39:03.333
I had a chance once. y'know.

565
00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.292
What? Prince Harry? Piss off.

566
00:39:07.458 --> 00:39:12.417
Vanity Fair party. Three years ago.

567
00:39:13.333 --> 00:39:16.125
Oh. I bet he could hardly see you

568
00:39:16.292 --> 00:39:19.333
through the wall of pussy
surrounding him.

569
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.042
Granted it was smaller than
the wall of bullshit surrounding you.

570
00:39:27.125 --> 00:39:31.625
-

571
00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:37.625
Hel-- Well. hello to you too.

572
00:39:39.083 --> 00:39:42.458
Don't talk to me like that. young lady.
your father's golfing.

573
00:39:44.167 --> 00:39:47.083
No I'm not paying for an Uber.
get a bus.

574
00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.875
Then take the tube.

575
00:39:50.042 --> 00:39:54.000
Well. then shoot yourself
out of a cannon for all I care!

576
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.417
I could actually kill her.

577
00:39:59.583 --> 00:40:01.833
Don't be ridiculous.

578
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.333
That's exactly what she wants.
Then you'd really feel sorry for her!

579
00:40:08.542 --> 00:40:12.417
And her father doesn't help anything.
Such a pushover.

580
00:40:12.583 --> 00:40:17.625
"Anything for you. darling. whatever
you need sweetheart. I love you. angel!"

581
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.250
It's enough to make ya sick.

582
00:40:21.417 --> 00:40:23.875
My father never loved me...

583
00:40:24.042 --> 00:40:28.292
Every time there's a new iPad.
or iPhone. or I don't give a fuck...

584
00:40:28.458 --> 00:40:29.500
She's got it in her hands.

585
00:40:29.667 --> 00:40:33.250
Cause God forbid. she'd have to actually
interact with another human being!

586
00:40:33.417 --> 00:40:35.542
Y'know! Although...

587
00:40:35.708 --> 00:40:40.500
Did you see the video
of the dog driving the car?

588
00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:43.083
No. no. I saw a squirrel.

589
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:49.083
- No. no. no. no. This was a pug.
-

590
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:50.875
It's wearing a little hat!

591
00:40:52.458 --> 00:40:55.250
Oh Maxie. Maxie.
come and have a look at this!

592
00:40:55.417 --> 00:40:57.375
- Maxie!

593
00:40:57.542 --> 00:40:58.833
What the hell are you doing?

594
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.417
He's trying to fucking off himself.
that's what!

595
00:41:02.375 --> 00:41:05.542
Ah. ah. No. No. no. no.

596
00:41:08.083 --> 00:41:09.625
-

597
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.083
Relax. It's from Killing Man 2.
the props guys let me keep it.

598
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:21.500
Oh yeah. Killing Man 2.
"Even more killing." That was my tagline.

599
00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:26.417
And you are holding a gun
to your head. why?

600
00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:29.500
Sympathy.

601
00:41:31.417 --> 00:41:35.250
We take a photo.
make it look like I might just do it.

602
00:41:35.417 --> 00:41:41.125
Then one of you sends it to Sophia.
If she's the leak. this'll make her stop.

603
00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:45.042
Checkmate. Minxie. I like it!

604
00:41:45.208 --> 00:41:46.250
- No!
- No?

605
00:41:46.417 --> 00:41:48.292
- No!
- No.

606
00:41:48.458 --> 00:41:53.292
This is bad. I mean.
really bad publicity.

607
00:41:53.458 --> 00:41:55.250
I thought you said
there was no such thing.

608
00:41:55.417 --> 00:41:58.458
- Figure of fucking speech!
-

609
00:42:00.458 --> 00:42:02.375
What is it now?

610
00:42:05.542 --> 00:42:07.333
Max is live tweeting.

611
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.042
That's impossible!

612
00:42:09.208 --> 00:42:12.167
And yet here we are.

613
00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:14.417
So what's he saying now?

614
00:42:15.542 --> 00:42:19.167
"I've been stuck up. vain.
and uncaring for far too long.

615
00:42:19.333 --> 00:42:21.333
I took those photos.
I wrote those texts...

616
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.375
Because as a white male
I can pretty much do whatever I want."

617
00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:27.833
- She's got you there.
-

618
00:42:30.625 --> 00:42:32.167
"But I don't deserve what I have.

619
00:42:32.333 --> 00:42:35.250
I've merely benefitted
from the misfortunes of others."

620
00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.958
"That's why I'm donating my entire salary
to the Fair Play Fund."

621
00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:43.458
- His entire salary?
- My entire salary?

622
00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:01.083
- Don't shoot!

623
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:03.667
You're in big trouble. young lady!

624
00:43:04.417 --> 00:43:07.042
I'll deal with you later!

625
00:43:11.417 --> 00:43:13.083
Just a moment...

626
00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:21.583
Not bad. Casanova. Not bad.

627
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:26.917
I mean... a little young perhaps.
but not bad.

628
00:43:27.083 --> 00:43:29.125
Oh please. you've had younger.

629
00:43:29.292 --> 00:43:31.792
You bet your arse I have.

630
00:43:31.958 --> 00:43:33.375
What's the hold up?

631
00:43:33.542 --> 00:43:35.458
Coming. dear!

632
00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:40.250
So. this video.
what are we talking about?

633
00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:45.875
Is it a good ol' fashioned fuck.
or is it something else entirely?

634
00:43:46.042 --> 00:43:53.417
Are we talking. Chopstick Sandwich?
Carolina Special?

635
00:43:54.208 --> 00:43:58.708
Mashugana Friday!
Oh come on. give me something!

636
00:43:58.875 --> 00:44:00.333
Be a sport!

637
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.000
- We'll come back to this!

638
00:44:11.042 --> 00:44:16.042
Here it comes. Colleen Atley.
"Max Peters is getting what he deserves.

639
00:44:16.208 --> 00:44:19.875
We worked together years ago.
he was awful then and he's awful now."

640
00:44:20.042 --> 00:44:24.167
Hashtag too little too late. hashtag
Max Peters is a fascist. and so on.

641
00:44:24.333 --> 00:44:26.500
It wasn't even me.
she's thinking of Christian Bale.

642
00:44:26.667 --> 00:44:30.875
Barista Bridget. "Orders coffee
from me every day and never tips."

643
00:44:31.042 --> 00:44:32.208
That's true.

644
00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:34.958
Norine Booth says.
you once pushed her on the bus?

645
00:44:35.125 --> 00:44:37.875
- We were eight years old.
- Women never forget!

646
00:44:44.917 --> 00:44:48.542
German jackass.
He wants to throw Max off the movie.

647
00:44:49.958 --> 00:44:51.417
Off the movie?

648
00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:56.500
Oh my God. it's happening.
I'm being replaced.

649
00:44:56.667 --> 00:44:59.292
No one is being replaced!

650
00:44:59.458 --> 00:45:04.375
I am. It's happening.
I can feel it all slipping away.

651
00:45:07.458 --> 00:45:14.583
Don't do this! Not now. not now.
Okay. okay. Fuck. fuck. fuck!

652
00:45:16.667 --> 00:45:18.417
I can't feel my arms.

653
00:45:21.667 --> 00:45:27.833
Lucille. what do I do?
I can't feel my arms!

654
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.250
Shut up. Just shut up!

655
00:45:30.417 --> 00:45:33.958
Fuck. fuck. fuck.
fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck!

656
00:45:34.125 --> 00:45:37.000
Hashtag. Fuck. Cunt!

657
00:45:38.625 --> 00:45:41.125
Tweet. And then. then. then suicide.

658
00:45:41.292 --> 00:45:45.875
And then Peaches!
And then racist! Sex tape!

659
00:45:46.042 --> 00:45:49.083
Motherfaaa...

660
00:45:56.167 --> 00:46:00.667
I can't swear. I can't feel my...

661
00:46:02.583 --> 00:46:07.917
You. You did this.

662
00:46:17.667 --> 00:46:19.917
- Lucille speaking.

663
00:46:20.083 --> 00:46:21.875
You listen to me. and you listen good.

664
00:46:22.042 --> 00:46:26.083
Max Peters is a lost soul
in this ocean of lies we call a business.

665
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:28.167
You listen good. You lay witness.

666
00:46:28.333 --> 00:46:32.875
You don't even blink baby because
this is gonna be the year of Max Peters!

667
00:46:33.042 --> 00:46:35.750
He is not only the greatest actor
working today.

668
00:46:35.917 --> 00:46:41.208
but the greatest actor of his generation!
End fucking quote!

669
00:46:42.083 --> 00:46:43.125
Come on.

670
00:46:43.917 --> 00:46:44.958
We're going out there.

671
00:46:45.125 --> 00:46:50.917
What? You said don't talk to the press.
you said don't go outside no matter what.

672
00:46:51.083 --> 00:46:58.458
Don't go outside without me.
Now I'm ready. Ho ho ho. am I ready.

673
00:46:58.625 --> 00:47:00.750
Luce. I'm not sure.

674
00:47:00.917 --> 00:47:02.917
- Pussy!
- Tyrant!

675
00:48:18.042 --> 00:48:21.458
Had a good time? Hm?

676
00:48:31.958 --> 00:48:32.958
Done!

677
00:48:34.042 --> 00:48:36.250
Memorize this like your life
depends on it.

678
00:48:36.417 --> 00:48:40.917
But don't take too long. I can feel
the adrenaline rushing through my veins.

679
00:48:41.083 --> 00:48:43.167
- I don't know. Luce...
- What?

680
00:48:44.208 --> 00:48:47.250
- They're gonna rip me to shreds.
- Just stick to the script!

681
00:48:47.417 --> 00:48:51.625
Is that all you can say? I mean
take a look around. this is ludicrous!

682
00:48:53.917 --> 00:48:55.083
Now put him on the phone!

683
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:59.167
Before I stick my hand up your arse
and turn you into a Chinese hand puppet!

684
00:48:59.333 --> 00:49:02.083
The ingratitude stops right here.

685
00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:05.958
If you haven't forgotten. we are balls
deep in a bowl of shit-pea soup.

686
00:49:06.125 --> 00:49:09.917
And if we're not careful.
a side of sex tape pudding!

687
00:49:10.083 --> 00:49:11.417
Sorry. I'm hungry.

688
00:49:11.583 --> 00:49:14.375
Let's just lay low and wait it out.

689
00:49:14.542 --> 00:49:16.333
I don't wait. I pounce!

690
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.958
Luce. This is trash.

691
00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:22.083
So what else is new?
C'mon. I'll give you a read.

692
00:49:27.333 --> 00:49:31.500
"I'm just like you.
sometimes I make mistakes.

693
00:49:31.667 --> 00:49:34.458
Not unlike my character. Tom Carter.
in the next Blood Island sequel.

694
00:49:34.625 --> 00:49:36.250
Coming July 1st!"

695
00:49:37.417 --> 00:49:40.542
So. don't forget to mention
how much you enjoyed filming.

696
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:45.958
I went to RADA.

697
00:49:46.125 --> 00:49:47.250
And I went to Harvard.

698
00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:49.875
- You didn't go to Harvard.
- It's a figure of speech.

699
00:49:50.042 --> 00:49:54.458
Do you know how many struggling actors
would kill for the life you have?

700
00:49:54.625 --> 00:49:55.875
At least they're doing good work.

701
00:49:56.042 --> 00:49:57.875
And how do you know? Who's seeing it?

702
00:49:58.042 --> 00:50:01.083
When's the last time you headed
down to Camden Community Theatre?

703
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:06.458
I want to act. I am an actor!

704
00:50:06.625 --> 00:50:08.917
No you're not.
And y'know how I know?

705
00:50:09.083 --> 00:50:12.375
Cause I don't handle actors.
I handle stars.

706
00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:14.250
So you go ahead. it's okay.

707
00:50:14.417 --> 00:50:18.042
You just have whatever crisis
of conscience you need to have.

708
00:50:18.208 --> 00:50:21.625
But you are reading
this fucking statement!

709
00:50:27.917 --> 00:50:29.250
Maxie boy.

710
00:50:30.208 --> 00:50:32.167
Where do you keep your knives?

711
00:50:32.333 --> 00:50:34.500
Shut up. he's learning lines.

712
00:50:34.667 --> 00:50:36.542
What do you need a knife for anyway?

713
00:50:37.292 --> 00:50:41.167
If you must know. I've got a rock
at the bottom of my shoe.

714
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.458
Gargle!

715
00:50:46.333 --> 00:50:48.042
Good for the vocal chords.

716
00:51:18.292 --> 00:51:20.333
"I'm as appalled as you are.

717
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:27.292
I'm sorry to my friends. my family.
and my fans. Especially the young ones.

718
00:51:28.542 --> 00:51:30.250
Especially the young ones.

719
00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:36.500
The truth is I'm just like you.
and sometimes I make mistakes.

720
00:51:38.417 --> 00:51:42.958
Not unlike my character. Tom Carter.
in the next Blood Island sequel."

721
00:51:43.125 --> 00:51:45.167
Is that supposed to be an apology?

722
00:51:45.333 --> 00:51:47.250
It's for those leeches outside.

723
00:51:47.417 --> 00:51:49.917
Good! For a second
I thought it was for me.

724
00:51:50.958 --> 00:51:52.625
Is that really what you're gonna say?

725
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.167
Looks that way.

726
00:51:55.333 --> 00:51:59.167
It sounds so fake.
An apology should come from the heart.

727
00:52:02.625 --> 00:52:04.667
- You thirsty?
- Terribly!

728
00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:09.042
Okay.

729
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:11.917
I'm coming in.

730
00:52:20.042 --> 00:52:21.417
You're not gonna hit me. are you?

731
00:52:21.583 --> 00:52:23.250
You're not gonna shoot me. are you?

732
00:52:23.417 --> 00:52:26.458
The gun's fake. She didn't even know
she was carrying it.

733
00:52:26.625 --> 00:52:32.417
Yeah well. the bat is real.
And I know I have it.

734
00:52:48.625 --> 00:52:52.042
Do you want something to eat?
I could. I can make you a sandwich.

735
00:52:52.625 --> 00:52:54.417
I am allergic to gluten.

736
00:52:55.917 --> 00:52:59.417
Well um. I can't eat peanut butter. so...

737
00:53:08.083 --> 00:53:10.250
This isn't the morning I had in mind.

738
00:53:12.333 --> 00:53:15.417
Y'know. I think part of me is relieved.

739
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:20.417
These big actors present
such a perfect image all the time.

740
00:53:20.583 --> 00:53:22.333
It's good to know you have a pulse.

741
00:53:23.208 --> 00:53:25.458
- Where'd you get this?
- What? Your script?

742
00:53:25.625 --> 00:53:28.125
This is private!
You shouldn't be reading it.

743
00:53:28.292 --> 00:53:29.958
Then why'd you write it?

744
00:53:30.125 --> 00:53:32.250
Look! It's not ready yet.

745
00:53:32.417 --> 00:53:33.458
I liked it.

746
00:53:33.625 --> 00:53:35.333
Well it doesn't matter what you--

747
00:53:38.125 --> 00:53:41.375
- You liked it?
- Yeah. so far.

748
00:53:41.542 --> 00:53:44.083
Moves well. raises the stakes.

749
00:53:45.083 --> 00:53:46.125
I thought you didn't watch movies.

750
00:53:46.292 --> 00:53:50.292
I don't. but I used to read for my dad.
He's this big producer.

751
00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.250
Y'know. Morgan Stanhope
wants to direct.

752
00:53:54.417 --> 00:53:58.875
I heard he's good. He did that real
deep movie everyone's talking about--

753
00:53:59.042 --> 00:54:01.750
My Private Shame.
Might even win an Oscar.

754
00:54:01.917 --> 00:54:04.458
Granted. it needs a bit of work.

755
00:54:04.625 --> 00:54:08.292
The story arc can get confusing
and the brother needs layering.

756
00:54:08.458 --> 00:54:11.042
- Okay thanks. I'll get it in mind--
- He never really comes off the page.

757
00:54:11.208 --> 00:54:13.375
- Feels like a stock character.
- Yeah. I got it!

758
00:54:16.583 --> 00:54:19.250
What? You can't take criticism?

759
00:54:20.292 --> 00:54:23.792
Considering how much
I hate you right now.

760
00:54:23.958 --> 00:54:26.708
I think it's a miracle I liked it at all.

761
00:54:28.458 --> 00:54:35.250
As much as it kills me to say. this is
a great film and you'd be great in it.

762
00:54:37.042 --> 00:54:39.250
- Thanks.
- Are you married to the title?

763
00:54:39.417 --> 00:54:41.542
- Oh forget it!
- God. you're touchy!

764
00:54:41.708 --> 00:54:45.500
Well. I'm sorry. I just gave away
my entire salary thanks to you.

765
00:54:45.667 --> 00:54:47.250
It's been a shit morning!

766
00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:49.917
Really? A shit morning?

767
00:54:52.208 --> 00:54:54.083
A shit morning.

768
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.417
And where does that guy get off?

769
00:55:01.333 --> 00:55:04.500
- Timothy.
- Yeah! Where does he get off?

770
00:55:04.667 --> 00:55:08.917
I mean. he's like a walking fuck you
to feminism everywhere.

771
00:55:09.083 --> 00:55:11.500
Cunt this. and sweetie that.

772
00:55:11.667 --> 00:55:13.542
Dirty old bastard.

773
00:55:14.583 --> 00:55:20.042
Maxie boy? Where are you hiding
that delightful tush?

774
00:55:22.333 --> 00:55:29.042
Come out. boy. It's time to become
the man who sold the world!

775
00:55:29.208 --> 00:55:34.833
- Don't want to keep master waiting.
- You coming?

776
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.042
I'm not going anywhere until they leave.
Besides. I wanna see what happens.

777
00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:44.417
Well... keep the water.

778
00:55:45.333 --> 00:55:48.292
Oh thanks. Maxie.
you're too good to me.

779
00:55:52.208 --> 00:55:55.458
Anything for you. ya cunt.

780
00:56:07.125 --> 00:56:08.375
I'm gonna...

781
00:56:11.083 --> 00:56:14.667
I'm. ah. I'm gonna go now.

782
00:56:29.417 --> 00:56:32.667
Oh. there's the boy wonder!

783
00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:37.375
Right. Let's just get this over with.

784
00:56:37.542 --> 00:56:39.083
Took ya long enough.

785
00:56:42.042 --> 00:56:47.667
Remember. Max.
pronunciate and speak clearly.

786
00:56:48.667 --> 00:56:52.417
The tip of the tongue.
the teeth. and the lips.

787
00:56:52.583 --> 00:56:59.250
Red leather. yellow leather.
Red leather. yellow leather.

788
00:56:59.417 --> 00:57:01.375
Peter piper picked a--

789
00:57:01.542 --> 00:57:03.208
Got it! Magda.

790
00:57:03.375 --> 00:57:06.625
Alright. it's now or never.

791
00:57:09.542 --> 00:57:11.417
God. I'm horny!

792
00:57:13.625 --> 00:57:16.167
Sophia baby! Baby. over here baby!

793
00:57:31.292 --> 00:57:36.625
I came as soon as I've heard.
Don't worry. Sophia's here.

794
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.208
You should see the crowd outside.

795
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:07.167
I think you're even more famous
than me now.

796
00:58:17.958 --> 00:58:20.375
I wasn't sure I still had your keys.

797
00:58:22.042 --> 00:58:24.417
But I found them in my purse.

798
00:58:30.583 --> 00:58:32.625
I ordered DePaulo's.

799
00:58:34.917 --> 00:58:36.667
Let it breathe.

800
00:58:41.083 --> 00:58:42.083
Sophia?

801
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:43.958
Hm-hm?

802
00:58:44.125 --> 00:58:47.375
Sophia. why are you here?

803
00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:49.667
You need me.

804
00:58:50.917 --> 00:58:52.417
He needs me.

805
00:58:55.542 --> 00:58:57.375
Sit down.

806
00:58:57.542 --> 00:58:58.500
Okay.

807
00:58:58.667 --> 00:59:01.000
No. Over here.

808
00:59:16.333 --> 00:59:21.458
This is Lucille. my publicist.
Timothy. my manager...

809
00:59:21.625 --> 00:59:23.958
And Magda. my acting coach.
Remember?

810
00:59:24.125 --> 00:59:25.333
No.

811
00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.917
Our lunch should be arriving any moment.
so if you don't mind.

812
00:59:29.083 --> 00:59:32.500
Do you have any idea
what's going on here?

813
00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:35.208
Of course. It's terrible.

814
00:59:36.375 --> 00:59:38.417
Don't do this.

815
00:59:40.208 --> 00:59:43.333
Don't pretend.
You enjoy this. don't you?

816
00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:49.125
Leaking this boy's spirit to the world.

817
00:59:49.292 --> 00:59:54.958
Sucking his entire life force out of him
and leaving an empty shell of a man.

818
00:59:55.125 --> 00:59:59.917
With nothing to hold onto
except pain and humiliation.

819
01:00:01.292 --> 01:00:05.500
You. madame. are a temptress.

820
01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:13.042
A succubus from a dangerous world
that no one should ever visit!

821
01:00:14.417 --> 01:00:21.083
A creature so conniving and vengeful
that to utter your name

822
01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:26.625
will bring death
and destruction to us all.

823
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:31.250
You are pure evil. Sophia.

824
01:00:31.417 --> 01:00:32.500
Sophia!

825
01:00:32.667 --> 01:00:35.500
Sophia!

826
01:00:35.667 --> 01:00:38.458
Magda can be a little dramatic.

827
01:00:40.167 --> 01:00:43.792
So let me spell it out for you.
We know you sold Maxie out.

828
01:00:43.958 --> 01:00:47.958
And why would I do such a thing?
You believe me. don't you. Max?

829
01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:51.458
Don't answer that!
Don't you even dare.

830
01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:55.500
Let him speak. And who do you think
you are. controlling him like that?

831
01:00:57.208 --> 01:00:59.250
I'm his publicist. that's who.

832
01:00:59.417 --> 01:01:03.958
And I'm his manager.
So you fuck with him. you fuck with me.

833
01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:07.458
- Like I'd ever fuck you.
- Oh. I like this one.

834
01:01:07.625 --> 01:01:10.917
Take it easy. Can't you see
you're hurting her feelings?

835
01:01:11.083 --> 01:01:14.375
She has no feelings!

836
01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:16.250
Maxie! Let us handle this--

837
01:01:16.417 --> 01:01:17.625
No!

838
01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:22.000
You're always telling me
what to say and what to do--

839
01:01:22.167 --> 01:01:24.250
- And what to wear!
- Exactly.

840
01:01:24.417 --> 01:01:28.458
For once. I'm gonna make
my own decision.

841
01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:32.875
Oh I think that's a grand idea!

842
01:01:33.042 --> 01:01:35.500
- It is.
- Isn't it. Lucille?

843
01:01:35.667 --> 01:01:37.500
Of course!

844
01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:41.250
- Maxie's his own man.
- His own man indeed.

845
01:01:41.417 --> 01:01:44.917
So. Ken doll. what's it gonna be?
Huh? Huh?

846
01:01:45.083 --> 01:01:47.750
A romantic lunch
with Ursula The Witch?

847
01:01:47.917 --> 01:01:53.750
Or a jolly good piss up
with your old pals. Timothy and Lucille.

848
01:01:53.917 --> 01:01:57.167
- And Magda.

849
01:02:02.917 --> 01:02:04.000
I don't know.

850
01:02:04.542 --> 01:02:06.375
I'm going to the loo.

851
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.333
Okay. bambino. Let's chat.

852
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.750
Go ahead.

853
01:02:19.917 --> 01:02:23.042
I know you did it. and I know why.
You're jealous.

854
01:02:23.208 --> 01:02:25.333
- Jealous of what?
- His fame. his relevance.

855
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:30.083
That used to be you. didn't it?
Oh how things change. Sophia!

856
01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:33.208
- You're trying too hard. Lucille.
- Oh. for goodness sake!

857
01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:34.667
Stop it!

858
01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:37.125
Here. Here.

859
01:02:38.042 --> 01:02:40.417
Take what you want. I'm loaded.

860
01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:42.250
You're paying her off?

861
01:02:42.417 --> 01:02:45.125
Of course not.
Pretty boy's commission just doubled.

862
01:02:45.292 --> 01:02:46.792
In that case. I'm in too.

863
01:02:46.958 --> 01:02:50.042
Him I believe. but you?
I thought you had more dignity.

864
01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:51.500
Well. I don't!

865
01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:56.125
So. what have we got here?

866
01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:01.625
Twenty five hundred!

867
01:03:02.625 --> 01:03:06.667
Add Lucille's and that makes
for a pretty good Sunday morning.

868
01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:09.250
But you don't have cash. do you?

869
01:03:11.625 --> 01:03:14.083
No! But I can get it.

870
01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:16.000
First. hand over the file.

871
01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.458
And what file would that be?

872
01:03:17.625 --> 01:03:19.875
You know goddamn well what file it is.

873
01:03:20.042 --> 01:03:22.083
- Oh. do I?
- Yes. you do!

874
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.583
- Oh. I do?
- Yes!

875
01:03:27.917 --> 01:03:30.250
- But do I?
- Don't do that!

876
01:03:30.417 --> 01:03:31.500
Are you saying you're innocent?

877
01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:33.958
It doesn't matter what she says.
it's what she doesn't say.

878
01:03:34.125 --> 01:03:35.833
Don't you know anything about women?

879
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.250
No. goddamnit. I'm a man.

880
01:03:38.417 --> 01:03:40.417
She did it alright.

881
01:03:42.167 --> 01:03:45.083
- Maybe you did it.
- Me?

882
01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:47.750
Yeah. you.
Did you ever think about that?

883
01:03:47.917 --> 01:03:49.875
Actually we did. But we decided--

884
01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:52.417
Look. Sophia.
We know what happened.

885
01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:56.292
He cheated.
And you have every right to be angry.

886
01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.417
- Hell. burn his suits--
- Smash his bike.

887
01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:01.958
Throw his goddamn couch
out the window! We'll even help you.

888
01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:03.958
- We'll help you.
- Hurt him!

889
01:04:04.125 --> 01:04:08.542
But don't hurt us.

890
01:04:10.208 --> 01:04:11.750
Lunch should be arriving any moment.

891
01:04:11.917 --> 01:04:14.500
and I suggest you leave
before you make things any worse.

892
01:04:14.667 --> 01:04:17.375
I'm not going anywhere
before I get my money back!

893
01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:19.208
Don't bother saying goodbye.

894
01:04:19.375 --> 01:04:26.750
- Oh. please.

895
01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:30.583
Have fun getting double-teamed
by Franco and Mussolini!

896
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:31.875
Really?

897
01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:34.000
I left for one minute.

898
01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:37.667
So. Maxie? What's it gonna be?

899
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:43.917
Well. I've thought about. and...

900
01:04:45.292 --> 01:04:48.250
- I believe her.
- Christ almighty!

901
01:04:49.042 --> 01:04:52.042
Thank you. my love.

902
01:04:54.042 --> 01:04:57.250
I never should have cheated.
I was so stupid.

903
01:04:57.417 --> 01:04:59.417
I know.

904
01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:01.458
I know. you were you so stupid.

905
01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:03.333
Stupid.

906
01:05:04.375 --> 01:05:08.083
Stupid and...

907
01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:09.250
And?

908
01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:13.458
Stupid. And?

909
01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:15.958
Sorry!

910
01:05:16.125 --> 01:05:19.250
Yes! Stupid and sorry.

911
01:05:19.417 --> 01:05:24.333
Oh babe. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'll never leave you.

912
01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:27.708
- Never.
- Never ever.

913
01:05:32.542 --> 01:05:35.542
I am so hungry.

914
01:05:36.583 --> 01:05:38.417
Aren't you hungry?

915
01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:41.292
Starving.

916
01:05:42.542 --> 01:05:45.083
Well. guys.
it's so brilliant of you to come.

917
01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:46.875
But we've got it from here. so--

918
01:05:47.042 --> 01:05:49.500
As your publicist
I really must advise against this!

919
01:05:49.667 --> 01:05:51.250
I don't care. Just. just get out.

920
01:05:51.417 --> 01:05:53.250
Whoever did this is still out there!

921
01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:56.917
- You're not gonna find them in here.
- Actually! I. I--

922
01:05:59.417 --> 01:06:00.917
I'd like to stay.

923
01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.875
- Just go.
- Alright. alright! Down. boy.

924
01:06:05.042 --> 01:06:06.667
I need a cigarette anyway.

925
01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:09.125
Don't forget to tell her about the thing.

926
01:06:09.292 --> 01:06:10.917
Yes. yes. Fine. fine.

927
01:06:12.292 --> 01:06:14.083
What thing?

928
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:16.833
You know. The thing.

929
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.833
She deserves to know.
I mean. I'd wanna know.

930
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.208
We tried to tell her. but it's
so sensitive. better it comes from you.

931
01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:26.167
Yeah but. there is no thing.
What is there to know?

932
01:06:26.333 --> 01:06:27.750
What are you talking about?

933
01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.208
You know. The thing.

934
01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:34.458
The thing.

935
01:06:34.625 --> 01:06:36.250
The oh. oh. oh. oh. thing!

936
01:06:36.417 --> 01:06:38.458
The sex tape! My God!

937
01:06:38.625 --> 01:06:39.875
Thank you. Magda.

938
01:06:40.042 --> 01:06:41.667
What did she say?

939
01:06:41.833 --> 01:06:44.625
Oh. It's nothing. I mean.
if it hasn't been released yet. then...

940
01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:48.417
If what hasn't been released yet?

941
01:06:55.667 --> 01:06:56.875
What?

942
01:06:57.042 --> 01:06:58.250
Our. um...

943
01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:01.083
Sex tape.

944
01:07:03.625 --> 01:07:06.583
- What the hell is wrong with you?

945
01:07:08.417 --> 01:07:12.417
What we did was sacred?
You just kept it on your phone?

946
01:07:12.583 --> 01:07:15.667
Look. I didn't think something like this
was going to happen. it's just--

947
01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:18.542
Not inside. Lucille!

948
01:07:20.667 --> 01:07:25.042
No. I don't believe her
for a second.

949
01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:27.833
And what kind of monster
do you think I am?

950
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.833
- Werewolf.
- Banshee.

951
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.250
- Vampire.
- Oh stop it! Y'know what. just stop it.

952
01:07:34.042 --> 01:07:35.292
I didn't do this.

953
01:07:36.167 --> 01:07:38.125
What do I need to do?

954
01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:42.375
Throw myself on the floor
and cut my wrists vein to vein?

955
01:07:42.542 --> 01:07:44.375
- That'd be a start!
- Magda!

956
01:07:44.958 --> 01:07:48.917
Oh please. I know overacting
when I see it. I invented it!

957
01:07:49.083 --> 01:07:51.333
How can you let her talk to me
like that?

958
01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.125
- She thinks you hate her.
- She's perceptive!

959
01:07:53.292 --> 01:07:55.167
- Lucille!
- I do hate her.

960
01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:56.375
- Magda!
- She's got a point.

961
01:07:56.542 --> 01:07:58.000
Timothy!

962
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:02.417
I say...

963
01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:05.917
- She's not to blame.
- And?

964
01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:07.625
And...

965
01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:10.792
I think you owe her an apology.

966
01:08:10.958 --> 01:08:13.917
A what? Apology?

967
01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:16.250
- No. no. no. no--
- No. no. no. no.

968
01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:19.250
Not just you. Everyone.

969
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.542
Oh no. I'm... I'm sorry. I...

970
01:08:24.625 --> 01:08:28.042
I never apologise. I've got a rule.

971
01:08:28.208 --> 01:08:31.625
You never apologise
to women or children.

972
01:08:32.583 --> 01:08:33.750
Please.

973
01:08:35.167 --> 01:08:36.417
For me.

974
01:08:38.417 --> 01:08:39.417
Fuck me.

975
01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:44.083
I can never say no
to those puppy dog eyes.

976
01:08:53.667 --> 01:08:56.125
Sophia. I'm a...

977
01:08:58.125 --> 01:08:59.250
I'm sorry.

978
01:09:04.667 --> 01:09:07.458
Sorry I blamed you for the whole...

979
01:09:08.917 --> 01:09:09.875
Thank-- Thank you.

980
01:09:10.042 --> 01:09:11.875
Although we have every right
to suspect you--

981
01:09:12.042 --> 01:09:13.750
All the signs are there.
I mean you'd have to be an idiot!

982
01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:15.125
Thank you!

983
01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.000
Sorry.

984
01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:27.625
I am not sorry!

985
01:09:33.333 --> 01:09:34.500
It's okay. Max.

986
01:09:35.417 --> 01:09:37.250
This'll all blow over soon.

987
01:09:37.417 --> 01:09:40.042
Yeah. yeah.
Stiff upper lip and all that.

988
01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:44.292
I'll put some feelers out.
find the kinky bastard.

989
01:09:44.458 --> 01:09:48.042
Now. who's up for a drink
at Ye Old Dick?

990
01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:52.167
I am. But only if that's a euphemism.

991
01:09:53.042 --> 01:09:54.125
- Where to?
- I am too.

992
01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:56.250
- You're not coming. dear.
- Screw you!

993
01:09:56.417 --> 01:09:57.417
Screw you too.

994
01:09:58.542 --> 01:10:03.333
Come on. Luce!
We should be drunk by now.

995
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.667
Lucille?

996
01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:10.417
What is it?

997
01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:12.917
I'd rather not say.

998
01:10:16.375 --> 01:10:17.750
Is it good?

999
01:10:18.583 --> 01:10:20.000
No.

1000
01:10:23.417 --> 01:10:24.667
Is it bad?

1001
01:10:28.417 --> 01:10:29.917
Is it touching?

1002
01:10:30.083 --> 01:10:31.833
You don't wanna know.

1003
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.208
Oh bugger!

1004
01:10:33.375 --> 01:10:35.500
Oh fuck. I'm finished.

1005
01:10:35.667 --> 01:10:39.875
Nonsense. we'll ride it past it.
No pun intended.

1006
01:10:40.042 --> 01:10:41.875
Like I never existed.

1007
01:10:42.042 --> 01:10:43.875
No. no. I can spin this.

1008
01:10:44.042 --> 01:10:46.250
Yeah. Lucille can spin anything.

1009
01:10:46.417 --> 01:10:50.458
Really? Is that why we're shut in my
apartment? Cause she can spin anything?

1010
01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:51.792
Might as well try.

1011
01:10:51.958 --> 01:10:55.250
Yeah. I can still get you some big roles.

1012
01:10:55.417 --> 01:10:58.083
I don't want big roles. I want respect!

1013
01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.125
- Fuck respect.
- You're not helping.

1014
01:11:00.292 --> 01:11:01.917
I had the perfect script too!

1015
01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:05.333
The one where you're a hunky alien
and you fall for Jennifer Lawrence?

1016
01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.583
No.

1017
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:09.292
Or the one where you're a burly cowboy
and you fall for Jennifer Lawrence?

1018
01:11:09.458 --> 01:11:10.500
No!

1019
01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:11.750
The one where you're a studly rancher --

1020
01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:14.083
No you don't know! Because I wrote it!

1021
01:11:16.958 --> 01:11:18.250
You wrote a script?

1022
01:11:19.417 --> 01:11:22.417
Well. don't leave us in suspense.
c'mon. what's it about?

1023
01:11:25.625 --> 01:11:29.250
Wait. you-- you really wanna know?

1024
01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:31.500
Of course we do. old chap!

1025
01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:34.042
It sounds brilliant!

1026
01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:35.750
I'm sure.

1027
01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:37.417
Okay. well...

1028
01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:41.292
I play Charlie Moss.

1029
01:11:41.458 --> 01:11:42.458
Charlie Moss.

1030
01:11:42.625 --> 01:11:44.417
Charlie loves three things.

1031
01:11:45.042 --> 01:11:50.042
Property development.
his wife. his kids. and sailing.

1032
01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:57.208
One day. they take their boat out on the
Hudson River. but a storm capsizes them.

1033
01:11:57.375 --> 01:12:01.750
As much as he tries.
Charlie can't save his family.

1034
01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:06.417
Left with a crushing emptiness
and a crippling fear of the water.

1035
01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:13.250
Charlie tears his life apart until he has
no possessions. no home. no burdens.

1036
01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:16.667
Finding meaning
in the smallest of places.

1037
01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:22.417
We end on Charlie
facing his biggest fear.

1038
01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:27.917
Sailing out... into the open ocean.

1039
01:12:30.417 --> 01:12:33.750
- Can we get Jennifer Lawrence?
- Oh. for fuck's sake.

1040
01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:41.667
It's the perfect part! Finally. something
with substance! What is it called?

1041
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.125
Beyond The Hudson.

1042
01:12:46.292 --> 01:12:48.500
Are we married to that?

1043
01:12:49.292 --> 01:12:55.250
Maxie. Maxie. Do you have any idea
how hard it is to produce?

1044
01:12:55.417 --> 01:13:01.042
No one's gonna give you money to
pout around the screen like a lost baby!

1045
01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:06.458
You're an action star.
act like one. kill somebody!

1046
01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:08.750
I thought you were here to help.

1047
01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:12.542
Yes. Help me. Not help you.

1048
01:13:13.083 --> 01:13:18.167
Oh Maxie! When life gives you lemons.
what do you do?

1049
01:13:18.333 --> 01:13:23.667
You go to an A-list party and snort
cocaine off a stranger's backside!

1050
01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:26.542
What Timothy is trying to say is.

1051
01:13:26.708 --> 01:13:29.667
this doesn't exactly
fit in with our plan.

1052
01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:33.458
We're negotiating three sequels
for you to star in.

1053
01:13:33.625 --> 01:13:39.500
All with tie-ins. promos. appearance
fees. press tours. endorsements.

1054
01:13:39.667 --> 01:13:45.500
All. while being the brand ambassador
to Cartier. Armani. and Vitamin Water.

1055
01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:52.125
I'm not so sure this type of film
is really the best move.

1056
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.292
Well. Morgan Stanhope thinks it is.

1057
01:13:56.125 --> 01:13:57.750
Who the fuck is that?

1058
01:13:57.917 --> 01:13:59.833
He's the new Sundance darling.

1059
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.917
And he wants to direct!

1060
01:14:02.083 --> 01:14:08.083
He's good. But. he's not exactly
a cash cow. He did My Private Shame.

1061
01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:11.250
"My private..." God.

1062
01:14:11.417 --> 01:14:13.250
It sounds wonderful. Max!

1063
01:14:13.417 --> 01:14:15.167
Shut up. Magda!

1064
01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:17.417
Well. it doesn't matter. does it?

1065
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:19.667
Nothing matters.

1066
01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:23.500
No one's gonna hire me now.

1067
01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.625
I'm just gonna stay in this apartment.

1068
01:14:30.625 --> 01:14:32.500
Until the power shuts off.

1069
01:14:32.667 --> 01:14:35.250
And the water stops running.

1070
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:43.125
I'll shower with rain water.

1071
01:14:47.625 --> 01:14:51.083
I'll catch unsuspecting birds for dinner.

1072
01:14:55.417 --> 01:14:57.583
Probably die of some rare disease.

1073
01:14:58.167 --> 01:15:01.958
Something so rare they'll...
they'll name it after me.

1074
01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:06.958
Max Peters disease.
That's what they'll call it.

1075
01:15:07.125 --> 01:15:09.167
Well. at least you'll be remembered!

1076
01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:14.333
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- Well. yes.

1077
01:15:16.375 --> 01:15:17.542
You're fired.

1078
01:15:18.917 --> 01:15:21.083
You're all fired!

1079
01:15:23.208 --> 01:15:27.875
No. You need a publicist.
You need a manager.

1080
01:15:28.042 --> 01:15:29.792
And you definitely need an acting coach.

1081
01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.333
No! It's over.

1082
01:15:32.042 --> 01:15:33.833
- Maxie. calm down.
- No. just get away!

1083
01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.083
- You turn everything to shit too!
- Max--

1084
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:40.000
Look. just go away.
Bye. Ciao. bella. Sayonara!

1085
01:15:40.167 --> 01:15:43.000
- What about us?
- What about us? There is no us.

1086
01:15:43.167 --> 01:15:46.042
You just turned up one day
and never left! Get out!

1087
01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.875
- Baby.
- Just go!

1088
01:15:48.042 --> 01:15:50.542
- Leave!
- No! Shut up!

1089
01:15:51.542 --> 01:15:53.917
Just shut up.

1090
01:15:58.583 --> 01:16:00.542
Please do listen to me. okay?

1091
01:16:01.417 --> 01:16:06.208
Everything is going to be fine.
If you just listen.

1092
01:16:09.167 --> 01:16:10.417
Are you listening?

1093
01:16:11.042 --> 01:16:16.417
Yes. I'm fucking listening. What is it?
What's so bloody important?

1094
01:16:22.542 --> 01:16:25.000
The tape isn't leaked.

1095
01:16:27.375 --> 01:16:29.958
Of course it is. Lucille told me--

1096
01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:32.458
No. it's not. They're lying.

1097
01:16:32.625 --> 01:16:35.167
They're trying to trick me.

1098
01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.417
She's right. Max.

1099
01:16:39.125 --> 01:16:42.333
Bonnie and Clyde strike again.

1100
01:16:47.208 --> 01:16:48.417
You have it.

1101
01:16:49.292 --> 01:16:50.333
You have everything.

1102
01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.417
I was gonna tell you over lunch.

1103
01:16:52.917 --> 01:16:55.333
You're always more reasonable
on a full stomach.

1104
01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.875
They told me it was you.
but I didn't believe them.

1105
01:16:58.042 --> 01:17:00.125
Of course it was me!

1106
01:17:00.292 --> 01:17:02.833
You broke my heart!

1107
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.583
You made me feel worthless.
You humiliated me!

1108
01:17:07.583 --> 01:17:12.125
And there you were. on every paper.
on every channel. on every cinema.

1109
01:17:12.292 --> 01:17:16.375
just showing the world
how perfect Max Peters is.

1110
01:17:19.375 --> 01:17:22.500
And the worst thing
is that I still love you.

1111
01:17:22.667 --> 01:17:24.583
I want to hate you.

1112
01:17:25.458 --> 01:17:27.958
I want to crush you.
but I still love you.

1113
01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:31.250
Sophia. give me the video.

1114
01:17:31.417 --> 01:17:33.458
You didn't say I love you too.

1115
01:17:33.625 --> 01:17:36.250
I love you. Give me the video.

1116
01:17:36.417 --> 01:17:38.167
No. Now you're just saying that.

1117
01:17:38.333 --> 01:17:39.750
Of course he is!

1118
01:17:39.917 --> 01:17:41.042
Lucille!

1119
01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:44.917
Y'know what? I'll delete it.

1120
01:17:45.083 --> 01:17:47.333
Come back to me. and I'll erase it.

1121
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.958
Okay. fine. Just get rid of it.

1122
01:17:50.125 --> 01:17:51.500
What? Right now?

1123
01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.875
Yes. right now!
When were you thinking?

1124
01:17:54.042 --> 01:17:56.250
Geez. mister pushy. I don't know.

1125
01:17:57.042 --> 01:17:58.083
Hey!

1126
01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:00.250
That wasn't very nice.

1127
01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:02.417
Sophia. give me the phone.

1128
01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:04.083
You didn't say please.

1129
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:06.083
Please give me the phone!

1130
01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:07.958
- Max. you're scaring me now.
- Sophia!

1131
01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:13.958
Yes. Maxie baby?

1132
01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:16.375
Did you have anything to say?

1133
01:18:16.542 --> 01:18:18.500
Christ. Maxie! She's got a knife!

1134
01:18:18.667 --> 01:18:21.125
Protect your face!

1135
01:18:21.292 --> 01:18:23.042
Sophia. what are you doing?

1136
01:18:23.625 --> 01:18:25.292
Sophia! What are you doing?

1137
01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:27.667
- Lucille!

1138
01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:31.958
Can't you leave your phone alone
for one second?

1139
01:18:32.125 --> 01:18:33.417
It's about you!

1140
01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:36.208
What? What does it say?

1141
01:18:36.375 --> 01:18:39.667
It's an email from Max.
Don't shoot the messenger.

1142
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:44.875
"Timothy is delusional.

1143
01:18:45.042 --> 01:18:49.667
He thinks he's cool because he swears
like a teenager but he's just a--

1144
01:18:51.042 --> 01:18:53.292
"Pathetic old man."

1145
01:18:56.583 --> 01:18:58.125
Right.

1146
01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.042
Kill the bastard.

1147
01:19:03.417 --> 01:19:08.417
I give you everything. you little shit.

1148
01:19:12.417 --> 01:19:14.958
- That really hurt.
- I'm sure it's just a joke.

1149
01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:20.208
It doesn't feel very fucking funny to me.

1150
01:19:26.458 --> 01:19:27.542
No.

1151
01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:31.917
Don't look. don't look! It's about you.

1152
01:19:32.083 --> 01:19:33.083
What is it? What is it?

1153
01:19:34.375 --> 01:19:36.250
No. it's nothing. I made a mistake.

1154
01:19:36.417 --> 01:19:38.333
Fucking tell me!

1155
01:19:42.667 --> 01:19:46.417
He says. and I'm-- I'm quoting here.

1156
01:19:48.208 --> 01:19:51.250
"Lucille is a grade-A basket case...

1157
01:19:52.625 --> 01:19:58.125
who takes it out on her spoiled kids
and that sorry excuse of a husband.

1158
01:19:59.375 --> 01:20:03.542
It's a wonder she can be so bent...

1159
01:20:04.958 --> 01:20:07.667
with that giant stick up her arse."

1160
01:20:10.042 --> 01:20:11.500
You son of a bitch.

1161
01:20:13.167 --> 01:20:15.333
I work day and night for you.

1162
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:20.250
And I'm just some crazy mom
who can't control her family?

1163
01:20:21.042 --> 01:20:23.417
You try being a parent sometime!

1164
01:20:26.542 --> 01:20:28.667
It's fucking hard.

1165
01:20:31.375 --> 01:20:33.250
You idiots!

1166
01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:37.125
Can't you see Sophia is doing this to us?

1167
01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:41.500
We need to stick together!

1168
01:20:54.333 --> 01:21:00.083
What does it say?

1169
01:21:16.125 --> 01:21:20.292
You think I'm a bad actor?

1170
01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:32.000
Stay away from me. Magda!

1171
01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:38.667
You still think I'm a bad actor?

1172
01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:41.333
I'm a brilliant actor!

1173
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:45.500
I am a brilliant actor!
You're the bad actor!

1174
01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:48.208
Stop hurting him!

1175
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Get off him!

1176
01:21:57.208 --> 01:22:00.875
And you. Sophia.
You made it all happen!

1177
01:22:01.042 --> 01:22:03.333
You opened your big mouth.

1178
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.375
And embarrassed me
in front of the whole world!

1179
01:22:05.542 --> 01:22:07.250
Stay away from me.

1180
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.958
Why? Huh?
You didn't stay away from us!

1181
01:22:12.125 --> 01:22:14.625
Don't come any closer.

1182
01:22:16.292 --> 01:22:19.500
You know what you are?

1183
01:22:22.042 --> 01:22:23.583
A stalker.

1184
01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:27.042
I'm not a stalker.

1185
01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.917
- A stalker.
- I love him.

1186
01:22:29.417 --> 01:22:31.292
- Stop it!
- A stalker!

1187
01:22:31.458 --> 01:22:34.333
I'm not a stalker!

1188
01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:47.250
Come here. you little cunt!

1189
01:22:55.042 --> 01:22:57.125
Nice shot.

1190
01:22:58.167 --> 01:22:59.375
Who the fuck was that?

1191
01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:02.125
That was Sophia.

1192
01:23:03.042 --> 01:23:04.042
Is she dead?

1193
01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:06.250
Well. if she is. she had it coming.

1194
01:23:06.417 --> 01:23:07.583
Timothy!

1195
01:23:08.333 --> 01:23:11.167
We were all thinking it!

1196
01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:17.417
Jesus.

1197
01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:20.000
She is alive.

1198
01:23:20.167 --> 01:23:22.292
Should we call an ambulance?

1199
01:23:22.458 --> 01:23:23.583
What for?

1200
01:23:24.417 --> 01:23:26.292
She could have internal bleeding.

1201
01:23:27.042 --> 01:23:33.625
Nonsense. She'll wake up
with an awful headache. Nothing more.

1202
01:23:35.667 --> 01:23:39.208
Magda Saint Claire. and you are?

1203
01:23:39.375 --> 01:23:40.500
Peaches.

1204
01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:43.333
What a lovely name.

1205
01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.333
You must be thirsty.

1206
01:23:46.667 --> 01:23:49.792
How about a nice glass
of ice cold water?

1207
01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:51.083
Or a herbal tea?

1208
01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:52.875
- There is no herbal tea.
- Sorry.

1209
01:23:53.042 --> 01:23:54.792
- No tea. dear.
- Sorry.

1210
01:23:54.958 --> 01:23:56.250
Get the money. honey.

1211
01:23:57.042 --> 01:23:58.458
Peaches. Peaches...

1212
01:23:58.625 --> 01:24:01.417
- My name is Timothy Fine--
- Don't touch me.

1213
01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:05.375
And I'm the top earning manager
at Intrepid Talent.

1214
01:24:05.542 --> 01:24:12.875
Now. Peaches. I look at you
and I think star...

1215
01:24:13.042 --> 01:24:19.042
Yes! I see Audrey Hepburn
meets Faye Dunaway.

1216
01:24:20.208 --> 01:24:22.500
Maybe the next Selena Gomez!

1217
01:24:22.667 --> 01:24:25.667
Y'know. Selena's a good friend.

1218
01:24:26.417 --> 01:24:27.458
Okay.

1219
01:24:27.625 --> 01:24:30.958
- Sorry. I've gotta take this. but--

1220
01:24:31.125 --> 01:24:37.042
Why don't you come by the office on
Monday and we can have a little natter?

1221
01:24:43.083 --> 01:24:44.833
Let's talk exposure.

1222
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.458
As your personal publicist.
I need you to run everything by me.

1223
01:24:49.625 --> 01:24:53.042
That's very important.
no questions asked.

1224
01:24:53.625 --> 01:24:56.792
- Are you for real?
- That's a question.

1225
01:24:56.958 --> 01:25:00.125
Now. the most important thing
is your image.

1226
01:25:00.292 --> 01:25:04.250
I need you to keep the focus
on your image.

1227
01:25:04.417 --> 01:25:08.292
Don't talk about what boys you like.
or what clubs you go to or--

1228
01:25:08.458 --> 01:25:11.417
Being kidnapped by a bunch of psychos?

1229
01:25:11.583 --> 01:25:13.875
Yeah. well not so fast. sweetie.

1230
01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:18.750
Lest we forget who hit who in the face
with a Louisville Slugger.

1231
01:25:18.917 --> 01:25:23.750
Poor Sophia may never be the same.

1232
01:25:23.917 --> 01:25:25.750
Right. Where were we?

1233
01:25:25.917 --> 01:25:32.042
Image! Image. image. image!
It's the most important thing.

1234
01:25:32.208 --> 01:25:34.250
Image is a construct.

1235
01:25:34.417 --> 01:25:35.917
That's the spirit!

1236
01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:39.417
Well. I really have to be going.

1237
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.667
But it was so lovely meeting you.

1238
01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:47.625
Where's Max?

1239
01:26:01.667 --> 01:26:03.333
Hell of a day.

1240
01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:08.417
You just keep that girl happy.
We don't any of this getting out.

1241
01:26:09.583 --> 01:26:10.875
That would be shame.

1242
01:26:11.042 --> 01:26:13.000
Oh. buck up!

1243
01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:15.250
This is a good project.

1244
01:26:15.417 --> 01:26:17.500
It doesn't matter. Maxie.

1245
01:26:17.667 --> 01:26:24.500
For God's sake! You're about
to become the biggest star in the world.

1246
01:26:25.375 --> 01:26:28.667
You do this film
and all that goes away. We go away.

1247
01:26:29.292 --> 01:26:33.250
Max. You pay us to obey us.

1248
01:26:34.125 --> 01:26:36.417
Forget the script.

1249
01:26:36.583 --> 01:26:38.833
- You don't think I can pull it off.
- Max.

1250
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.250
Luce. admit it.
You don't think I can act.

1251
01:26:45.542 --> 01:26:47.417
The jury's still out.

1252
01:26:48.542 --> 01:26:53.250
But hey! You're not my only client
with a crisis today.

1253
01:26:53.417 --> 01:26:58.250
Bloody Radcliffe has fallen
down a well in Picklescott.

1254
01:26:58.417 --> 01:27:00.292
Oh yeah? What's that code for?

1255
01:27:00.458 --> 01:27:03.083
No code. Danny's down there alright.

1256
01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:07.333
But like a good boy.
he stayed put and kept quiet.

1257
01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.917
Doesn't sound like he had a choice.

1258
01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:11.625
We all have a choice. Max.

1259
01:27:12.667 --> 01:27:15.375
Let me know when you make yours.

1260
01:27:17.167 --> 01:27:19.875
Really?
Because when I'm finished with you.

1261
01:27:20.042 --> 01:27:23.625
you'll be talking out of your arse
and shitting out of your mouth!

1262
01:27:30.083 --> 01:27:32.625
The little bugger hung up on me.

1263
01:27:36.625 --> 01:27:39.042
Good job today. He-Man.

1264
01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:42.250
Came out on top. I think.

1265
01:27:42.417 --> 01:27:43.958
You really think so?

1266
01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:48.417
Well. I know it could've been
a hell of a lot worse.

1267
01:27:50.625 --> 01:27:52.917
Wait! I'm coming with.

1268
01:27:53.083 --> 01:27:54.833
Can't you get your own cab?

1269
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.542
For what you pay me?

1270
01:27:57.583 --> 01:28:01.292
- They still out there?
- Oh no. no. no. Didn't you hear?

1271
01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:08.000
Bloody Radcliffe. Daniel Radcliffe.
stuck in a well somewhere in Shropshire.

1272
01:28:08.167 --> 01:28:10.500
I'm gonna ring that little Hufflepuff.

1273
01:28:10.667 --> 01:28:14.458
I quite like him.
Could you put us in touch?

1274
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.625
See you Monday. Peaches.

1275
01:28:20.417 --> 01:28:25.667
And remember. honeypeach.
mum's the word.

1276
01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:13.875
I want food.

1277
01:29:14.042 --> 01:29:16.583
- What was that?
- Food. I'd like some.

1278
01:29:17.417 --> 01:29:19.125
You must be starving.

1279
01:29:19.292 --> 01:29:21.875
Not starving. Just hungry.

1280
01:29:22.042 --> 01:29:24.500
What would you like?
I'll get you anything you want.

1281
01:29:26.625 --> 01:29:28.417
A great big lunch.

1282
01:29:29.042 --> 01:29:32.792
Still a bit early for lunch isn't it?
How about I make us some breakfast?

1283
01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:37.083
By the time we eat. it will be too late
for breakfast. We missed breakfast.

1284
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:39.125
We missed breakfast?

1285
01:29:39.292 --> 01:29:43.042
But we can fit an early lunch.
if we hurry.

1286
01:29:44.042 --> 01:29:45.292
Okay.

1287
01:29:47.042 --> 01:29:50.292
How about early lunch today...

1288
01:29:51.417 --> 01:29:52.750
and late dinner tomorrow?

1289
01:29:52.917 --> 01:29:55.458
I can't. I'm seeing my boyfriend.

1290
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.250
- DePaulo's!
- Just a second.
