3
00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.362
I wouldn't go that way.

4
00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:23.281
Good evening.

5
00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:26.993
You have come to steal from me tonight?

6
00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:31.957
I must apologize.

7
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.209
He can be a little...

8
00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:37.629
Overprotective at times.

9
00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.094
I am herr Goodman.

10
00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:45.679
Please.

11
00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:49.850
Shadows don't scare me anymore.

12
00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:00.485
That's better.

13
00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:15.208
What was it you were hoping to find?

14
00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:17.335
Money?

15
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:19.462
Jewels?

16
00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:25.552
My trÃ©hot?

17
00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:29.055
Ah. yes.

18
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:34.644
A beautiful and priceless piece.

19
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:42.444
I wonder what is it that drives one to...
To risk freedom

20
00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:44.905
or even death?

21
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.991
Come here.

22
00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:51.494
I promise I will not hurt you.

23
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.579
Come.

24
00:06:56.458 --> 00:07:00.629
Does she remind you of anyone?

25
00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.051
My mother.

26
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.348
I see now.

27
00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.484
Do you know what that is?

28
00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:26.696
Your number.

29
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:29.115
From the camps.

30
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:32.619
Many in the world continue to deny it.

31
00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:37.248
I am pleased to hear
you acknowledge the truth.

32
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.919
I knew I made the right choice.

33
00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:43.046
What do you mean?

34
00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.802
We are not too different. you and I.

35
00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:57.018
We both know what it means to carry
the suffering of our ancestors.

36
00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.565
hatred of our eternal enemy.

37
00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:09.322
You may not take the renoir tonight.

38
00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:12.659
but you may come and enjoy it
any time you like

39
00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:14.911
on one condition.

40
00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:20.125
And what is that?

41
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.546
Instead of stealing from me.

42
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.218
you're going to steal for me.

43
00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:57.078
Gentlemen.

44
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.957
Why are you here?

45
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:04.002
Oh. you know me. I couldn't stay away.

46
00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.379
Retirement doesn't really suit me.

47
00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:08.173
Have you tried gardening?

48
00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:10.884
A cruise. perhaps?

49
00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.973
You know. unless there was a vote
to remove me.

50
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:20.602
I believe I'm still a member
of this organization.

51
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:23.313
We should've voted you out
the moment you failed.

52
00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.689
I did what I had to do.

53
00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:27.150
That was not your decision to make.

54
00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:30.528
You know damn well
Josef would've destroyed those paintings

55
00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:33.448
rather than see them stay
in the hands of Nazis.

56
00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:38.828
What I don't know is what Josef
ever saw in you in the first place.

57
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:42.165
You've never belonged here.

58
00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.751
You can't ever understand.

59
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.467
I'll ask again.

60
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.640
Am I not still the ceo...

61
00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:02.018
Of this organization?

62
00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.270
Annabel...

63
00:10:06.898 --> 00:10:08.650
Welcome home. hmm?

64
00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:11.194
You look well.

65
00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.238
What brings you in?

66
00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:14.948
Alek.

67
00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:19.119
I found them. I found all of them.

68
00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:20.203
- What?
- Yes.

69
00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.455
- Where?
- Here. They're in Los Angeles.

70
00:10:22.539 --> 00:10:25.208
Our resources are no longer
at your disposal.

71
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.293
I'm not asking for permission.

72
00:10:27.377 --> 00:10:28.837
Oh. look. Annabel.

73
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.550
I want to honor Josef as much as you do.
but I'm afraid I have to agree.

74
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:34.759
No. alek. Listen to me.

75
00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:37.971
This is our chance to do everything
Josef wanted us to do.

76
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:44.853
The world will not forgive another failure
after what happened.

77
00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:50.233
We must put our faith and resources
in the courts.

78
00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.472
When I first met Josef.

79
00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:25.602
we had just arrived at the camp.

80
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:31.482
We were standing in line for our numbers.

81
00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:37.322
We were only ten years old.

82
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:40.909
Frightened and alone.

83
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:46.247
Being tattooed by strangers.

84
00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:55.423
And when the Americans freed us.
we ran away the first chance we got.

85
00:11:56.174 --> 00:12:01.471
We walked. we hiked.
we rode for four nights back to his home.

86
00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:07.685
All he could talk about
was getting back to this box.

87
00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:15.902
He was like a brother to me.

88
00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.280
A father to you.

89
00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:21.407
So you understand.

90
00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:25.119
I made a promise to Josef.

91
00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.376
One I plan on keeping.

92
00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.757
Tell us. Annabel. what do you need?

93
00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:51.228
So?

94
00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:52.897
They gave their full support.

95
00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:54.190
No. Seriously?

96
00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:57.278
Well. how'd you convince them
to trust you again?

97
00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:58.987
Not for you to worry about.

98
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.240
Now. this is still about stealing
paintings back from Nazis. right?

99
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:04.284
- Of course.
- Because last time it got personal.

100
00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:06.452
- and shit went sideways real fast.
- Like I said.

101
00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.204
it's not for you to worry about.

102
00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.831
Okay? Now. come on. Come on.

103
00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:11.040
Whoa. where are we going?

104
00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.333
We need intel.

105
00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:15.878
Please. not Lucille. Don't say Lucille.

106
00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.631
Yes. We're gonna go see Lucille. Come on.

107
00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.617
I'm in.

108
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:47.952
How are you in?

109
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:50.038
This is the strongest firewall we have.

110
00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:51.706
I don't know what to tell you.

111
00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:56.377
Back doors. buffer overflow.
vulnerabilities...

112
00:13:56.461 --> 00:13:58.671
Okay. Great. How do we fix it?

113
00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:01.591
That's not my job.

114
00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:05.094
Okay.

115
00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.723
Do I need to remind you of the conditions
of your little work-release?

116
00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:14.812
I'll run diagnostics and have a report
to you by tomorrow morning.

117
00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:18.149
Your lab rats should be able to close
most of the gaps in the firewall.

118
00:14:25.281 --> 00:14:26.366
Hey. luce.

119
00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:30.828
Eddie.

120
00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:32.789
_ |__ - how've you been?

121
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:35.083
- You look good. _ uh...

122
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.253
You clearly didn't understand
"stay the hell away from me."

123
00:14:40.213 --> 00:14:41.839
- You're still mad at me?
- Wow. I...

124
00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:44.467
Wait a minute.
If you're here. that means...

125
00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:46.969
Hey. Lucille.

126
00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:49.764
How you been?

127
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.100
Surviving.

128
00:14:52.809 --> 00:14:55.186
Good. I got a job for you.

129
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:56.687
I already have a job.

130
00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:58.022
What. working for the feds?

131
00:14:58.106 --> 00:15:00.983
Yeah. well. it pays the bills
and keeps me out of jail.

132
00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:03.903
We pull this one off.
you'll be free and clear.

133
00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:07.490
It's the FBI.
You don't just make a phone call.

134
00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.613
Why do you think you're still not in jail
right now?

135
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.079
Seriously?

136
00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:15.415
The syndicate still has connections
in the state capital.

137
00:15:16.124 --> 00:15:17.834
We'd be helping each other out.

138
00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:20.545
The only person you've ever helped out
is yourself.

139
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:23.965
I... I'm not down to go
through that shit again with you two.

140
00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:25.091
No. thank you.

141
00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:27.111
You really want to spend
the next five to ten years

142
00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:30.513
explaining shit to men
who aren't even half as smart as you?

143
00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.015
Huh? Come on. Lucy. Come on.

144
00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:35.852
You're better than that.

145
00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.146
I need you. mama.

146
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.982
I really need you.

147
00:15:44.694 --> 00:15:45.862
Him too?

148
00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.071
I'll deal with him.

149
00:15:57.206 --> 00:15:58.416
What are we stealing?

150
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:00.460
A painting.

151
00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:01.669
Four paintings.

152
00:16:01.752 --> 00:16:02.837
Wait. What? Four?

153
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.174
Four paintings. Come on.

154
00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:08.676
Four paintings.

155
00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:13.931
So. who's the Mark?

156
00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.349
Otto huizen.

157
00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:19.228
A German venture capitalist
whose investments are focused

158
00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.273
on trying to create
a Neo-Nazi fourth reich.

159
00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:25.860
- Sounds like a piece of work.
- Yeah. he's sadistic.

160
00:16:25.943 --> 00:16:28.029
And you're sure he has all four paintings.

161
00:16:33.117 --> 00:16:36.496
Huizen recently had
a business meeting with Uriel kantor.

162
00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:38.664
- The Russian oligarch?
- Yep.

163
00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:40.333
That's him.

164
00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:42.960
After a few bottles of vodka.

165
00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:45.230
they started trying to compare
whose billions were bigger.

166
00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.232
And priceless pieces of aitwork
came to mind?

167
00:16:47.256 --> 00:16:51.260
Huizen was bragging about
missing paintings only he gets to look at.

168
00:16:51.344 --> 00:16:54.347
A Russian and a Nazi.
What could go wrong?

169
00:16:55.097 --> 00:16:56.599
He's more than just a Russian.

170
00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:58.808
He's Jewish.

171
00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.813
His uncles were atauschwitz.
Same time as Josef.

172
00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.401
- So what's the play?
- Okay.

173
00:17:07.485 --> 00:17:10.863
I'm gonna spam his company's email server
with a weaponized pdf.

174
00:17:10.947 --> 00:17:13.991
I mean. it won't take long for one
of his idiot employees to click on it.

175
00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.286
And then the real fun begins.

176
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.733
- Whoo! Got you!
- Whoa. what the hell?

177
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:49.652
Got you.

178
00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:50.820
You okay?

179
00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:53.114
Oh. I am better than okay.

180
00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:57.410
Hook. line. and sinker. baby. I...

181
00:17:58.911 --> 00:18:05.793
I now have access to their network
and their log-in credentials...

182
00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.424
And their network...

183
00:18:30.735 --> 00:18:32.236
So. uh...

184
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.800
- You were saying that...
- Yeah. I was saying... I'm in. I'm...

185
00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:38.242
H can see everything.

186
00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.846
- What's everything?
- Everything. Everything.

187
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.956
Um. emails. banking info.
purchase history. browser history...

188
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.333
Whoa. whoa. wait. wait. wait.

189
00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:49.211
You-you can do that? You can. like.
see what websites he looks at?

190
00:18:49.295 --> 00:18:50.921
I could.

191
00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.257
That's a little scary.

192
00:18:53.966 --> 00:18:56.010
I bet he looks up a lot of weird shit.

193
00:18:58.763 --> 00:19:00.973
What. what do you... what do you mean?

194
00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:04.685
You know. rich guys like him. they all got
their freaky shit they're into.

195
00:19:04.769 --> 00:19:09.690
You know. I bet he looks up some. like.
bondage s&m type shit or something.

196
00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:16.030
Well. if you think that's freaky.
then you need to get out more often.

197
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.035
Oh. yeah? Well. that doesn't sound like
the Lucy I remember.

198
00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.162
Hmm. if you only knew.

199
00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:25.247
Okay. now get out of here.
You're making me hot.

200
00:19:25.331 --> 00:19:26.892
- Like. I'm hot. I'm hot.
- I do. I know.

201
00:19:26.916 --> 00:19:28.250
Go. Please.

202
00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:36.425
Hey. hey.

203
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:37.736
Hey. I gotta make this quick.

204
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.471
So. one of his dumb-ass lackeys
clicked on the fake file.

205
00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:43.514
It transmitted identifying packets
that I ran through a decryption program.

206
00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:45.434
- I pwned his network.
- You what?

207
00:19:45.518 --> 00:19:48.062
It... it means I made it my own. I own it.

208
00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:49.814
Any security systems will be online

209
00:19:49.897 --> 00:19:52.400
and I'll be able to disable
and intercept any alarms.

210
00:19:52.483 --> 00:19:53.984
Alright. [gotta go. Bye.

211
00:19:54.068 --> 00:19:55.653
Hey. good work.

212
00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:58.989
Now let's go steal us some blueprints.

213
00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:01.992
Okay. okay.

214
00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:07.123
Welcome. I'm Victoria.
What can we design for you?

215
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:08.874
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

216
00:20:08.958 --> 00:20:11.043
This is my assistant. Nathan...

217
00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:12.396
- Hi.
- And we're looking to build

218
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.880
a new weekend house on the northern coast.

219
00:20:14.964 --> 00:20:16.549
Excellent. If you'll follow me.

220
00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.236
we can head back to our conference room
and take a look at a few designs.

221
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.261
Thank you.

222
00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:26.475
Excuse me. Victoria?

223
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.060
Is there a washroom I may use?

224
00:20:28.144 --> 00:20:30.080
Of course. Just down this hallway
and to the right.

225
00:20:30.104 --> 00:20:31.105
Thank you.

226
00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:03.179
I like a lot of space.

227
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:05.222
You know. open floor plan.

228
00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.367
Of course. I think I have
just the architect for you.

229
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:09.310
Wonderful. I can't wait to meet them.

230
00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.772
Is everything alright?

231
00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:16.317
- Can I get you some coffee or water?
- No. I'm fine. thank you.

232
00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:18.235
I hope Nathan is okay.

233
00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.737
I'm sure he's okay.

234
00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:31.707
Would you excuse me?

235
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:33.711
I'm actually gonna go ahead
and use the restroom.

236
00:21:33.751 --> 00:21:34.960
- Of course.
- Thank you.

237
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.197
- Where have you been?
- I thought I'd take a tour. you know.

238
00:21:45.221 --> 00:21:47.240
- This looks like a nice place to work.
- We don't have time for that.

239
00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:48.950
- Did you get what we need?
- I got lost. okay.

240
00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:52.186
Just thought I'd ask questions... come on.

241
00:21:56.232 --> 00:21:57.483
We got a problem.

242
00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:59.985
I've been going through his emails.
invoices.

243
00:22:00.069 --> 00:22:03.322
Huizen has a safe technician to the house
every six months.

244
00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:06.116
So. I started searching
for other similar purchases

245
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.246
and found that he owns
a gateway super defender trx.

246
00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:12.414
It's one of the best home safes out there.

247
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.684
- We need a locksmith.
- We need a locksmith.

248
00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:16.168
Well. there's more.

249
00:22:16.252 --> 00:22:18.671
The security cameras around the house
are ip cameras.

250
00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:20.840
I've been streaming the feeds of each one.

251
00:22:20.923 --> 00:22:24.301
I've counted no less than
half a dozen guards on the property.

252
00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.555
We're gonna need a wildcard too.

253
00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:29.390
- Really? You sure?
- Yeah. Definitely.

254
00:22:29.473 --> 00:22:30.641
What about Ricky?

255
00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:33.477
Not up for parole for another 18 months.

256
00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:34.979
Max?

257
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:36.355
Got out. Retired.

258
00:22:39.692 --> 00:22:40.693
I might know a guy.

259
00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:42.278
Okay. Fine. Get him.

260
00:22:42.361 --> 00:22:44.029
I'm gonna go see Nadia.

261
00:23:00.629 --> 00:23:01.630
Hey. Nadia.

262
00:23:05.467 --> 00:23:07.153
Don't tell me you locked your keys
in the car.

263
00:23:07.177 --> 00:23:08.721
Well. hello to you too.

264
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:13.410
- What do you want?
- Looks like you could use

265
00:23:13.434 --> 00:23:16.145
a little excitement in your life
right now.

266
00:23:16.854 --> 00:23:18.314
- Excitement?
- Mm-hmm.

267
00:23:19.064 --> 00:23:21.525
I have all the excitement
I need right here.

268
00:23:22.776 --> 00:23:25.029
Mm-hmm. How about a challenge?

269
00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:28.949
I've known you for a very long time.

270
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:33.287
And you know damn well
you can't challenge me.

271
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:34.955
- Really?
- Yeah.

272
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:38.375
How about a gateway super defender?

273
00:23:38.459 --> 00:23:42.129
Residential. Heavily guarded. High stakes.

274
00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:44.798
Five. ten minutes tops?

275
00:23:46.091 --> 00:23:47.801
That safe is 20 man-hour resistant

276
00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:49.779
and you want me to break into one
in under ten minutes?

277
00:23:49.803 --> 00:23:52.014
- Yep.
- Is that right?

278
00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:53.182
Mm-hmm.

279
00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.102
I guess Eddie's gonna have to take
a crack at it. huh?

280
00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:58.896
Eddie?

281
00:23:58.979 --> 00:24:00.147
Mm-hmm.

282
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.901
How about you don't come into my shop
and insult me?

283
00:24:05.027 --> 00:24:06.236
So can you do it?

284
00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:16.288
I'm in.

285
00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:18.374
["Put your money on me"
by oi' big bear playing"

286
00:24:48.195 --> 00:24:49.989
- Come on here!
- Hey. Bruno!

287
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.136
If I see your ass here again.
you ain't gonna need a phone.

288
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.639
I'm gonna break every one of those fingers
on that pretty little hand of yours.

289
00:24:57.663 --> 00:24:59.999
You understand? Now piss off.

290
00:25:00.082 --> 00:25:01.291
Piss off!

291
00:25:01.375 --> 00:25:03.293
Eddie!

292
00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:06.171
What the hell. man?
What are you doing in. uh. skid row. huh?

293
00:25:06.255 --> 00:25:08.757
Still striking the fear of god
into children. I see.

294
00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:11.176
Agh. you know. the little shit
wanted to buy a phone.

295
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.862
then he thinks
he can just take off with it.

296
00:25:12.886 --> 00:25:14.346
Fucking kids these days.

297
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.974
What the hell you doing at a pawnshop?
You make good money here?

298
00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:21.645
Uh. you know. old man pays cash to keep
the crackheads and the tweakers out.

299
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:25.274
You want a real job? Big payday.

300
00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.819
Pulling your own work now?

301
00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:32.489
Not yet. Still with my same crew.

302
00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:36.869
Always play second fiddle
standing in the same place too long.

303
00:25:36.952 --> 00:25:38.704
Thanks for the career advice.

304
00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:40.622
You in?

305
00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:44.877
Shh. Whose ass I gotta kick. huh?

306
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:49.214
Okay. so huizen's property
is set up like a compound.

307
00:25:49.298 --> 00:25:52.509
It sits right on the water.
We're gonna take advantage of that. Okay?

308
00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:56.263
We're gonna moor here. and these rocks
shouldn't be difficult to get up.

309
00:25:56.346 --> 00:25:58.432
Uh. why... why the water?

310
00:25:58.515 --> 00:26:00.434
I mean. why not just approach on foot?

311
00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:03.312
Well. the back patio
is the least guarded side of the house.

312
00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:06.774
There are two guards at the front door
around the clock.

313
00:26:06.857 --> 00:26:08.233
two guards in the driveway.

314
00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:11.070
and another guard inside the house
that roams the first floor.

315
00:26:11.153 --> 00:26:15.491
A fourth one takes care of the back patio
about every 35 or 45 minutes.

316
00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:18.827
If we time it right.
we can get in the house undetected.

317
00:26:19.453 --> 00:26:21.080
Assuming there's sliding patio doors?

318
00:26:21.163 --> 00:26:24.625
Yep. We see them in the main floor camera
and the back patio camera.

319
00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:25.709
Nadia?

320
00:26:25.793 --> 00:26:28.921
Sliding glass doors usually have
a mortise bolt lock.

321
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:31.715
Easy to get into.
but I'll be ready for anything heavier.

322
00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:35.094
Okay. good. Once in.
we have to subdue the first floor guard.

323
00:26:35.177 --> 00:26:37.679
Hmm. Leave that to me.

324
00:26:37.763 --> 00:26:39.848
We just need him incapacitated. Not hurt.

325
00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:43.644
How are you expecting to drop someone
without hurting them? Just a tiny bit.

326
00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:45.521
- I mean. I... I can do it.
- Pull back.

327
00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:48.190
- I know a little jujitsu.
- A little?

328
00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:52.111
- Well. congratulations.
- Can you do it?

329
00:26:52.194 --> 00:26:54.404
- I think I can handle it.
- Alright.

330
00:26:54.488 --> 00:26:56.490
We'll find the safe
and then Nadia will be up.

331
00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:58.075
Uh. what about huizen?

332
00:26:58.158 --> 00:27:00.828
We hit the house when he's not home. Luce?

333
00:27:00.911 --> 00:27:03.747
Yeah. his secretary keeps his calendar
in the cloud.

334
00:27:03.831 --> 00:27:05.916
He'll be in San Francisco next weekend.

335
00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:07.199
Just the guards will be there.

336
00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:08.252
We can be in and out

337
00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:10.396
without any of other guards
ever knowing we were there.

338
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.133
Then it's set. Lucille will disable
the alarm from here.

339
00:27:14.216 --> 00:27:18.011
and override all the camera feed
creating a loop of clean feed.

340
00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:21.431
Wait a second. You're coming?

341
00:27:22.141 --> 00:27:24.768
Yeah. I'm coming.
Why shouldn't I?

342
00:27:24.852 --> 00:27:28.147
Uh... ooh...

343
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:29.356
I don't know.

344
00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:31.525
Um. it's just. uh...

345
00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:33.694
Um...

346
00:27:33.777 --> 00:27:35.279
Why? Because she's a woman?

347
00:27:35.362 --> 00:27:39.199
Um. it's just that... wow. Um...

348
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:41.094
Don't look at me. man.
You're digging your own grave here.

349
00:27:41.118 --> 00:27:44.121
- Yeah. okay.
- Okay. you... you're funny.

350
00:27:44.204 --> 00:27:47.583
You're real funny. bro. But. um. I've been
waiting on this score for a long time

351
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:50.085
so there's no way I'm gonna be missing it.
Okay? So...

352
00:27:50.711 --> 00:27:53.213
No. hey. it's cool. It's awesome. Love it.

353
00:27:53.297 --> 00:27:55.716
I don't have to be the fastest.
I just gotta outrun you.

354
00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:59.511
Oh. uh. even in heels.
you can't outrun me. okay? So. yeah.

355
00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:02.264
Alright. back to work.

356
00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:20.032
Annabel.

357
00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:27.164
Get my fucking purse!

358
00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:44.848
Ah. miss Gomez.

359
00:28:47.935 --> 00:28:50.312
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

360
00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:52.898
Please. sit.

361
00:28:57.236 --> 00:29:00.197
Do you know there's an actual bounty
on your head?

362
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.825
- The kerrs?
- Yeah.

363
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:08.580
Seems retribution is the price
for their destroyed monet.

364
00:29:08.664 --> 00:29:09.665
How much?

365
00:29:09.748 --> 00:29:10.832
The monet?

366
00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:12.167
The bounty.

367
00:29:12.251 --> 00:29:13.252
Half million.

368
00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:16.797
- Coffee?
- No. thank you.

369
00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:20.759
Tell me.

370
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.930
Why destroy such a priceless piece
of artwork?

371
00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:27.182
You know who the kerrs are
and where they're from.

372
00:29:27.266 --> 00:29:33.313
Ah. so their ideology gives you the right
to take and destroy what is theirs?

373
00:29:33.397 --> 00:29:35.399
It's not theirs. It was stolen.

374
00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:36.858
- Really?
- Yeah.

375
00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:38.235
From whom? When?

376
00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:42.823
It was taken from the Rosenbaum family
during the Nazi plunder of France.

377
00:29:42.906 --> 00:29:44.116
Sound familiar?

378
00:29:44.199 --> 00:29:45.909
Never heard of such a thing.

379
00:29:47.911 --> 00:29:50.330
What about the execution
of six million Jews?

380
00:29:50.414 --> 00:29:52.374
I bet you never heard of that either. huh?

381
00:29:52.457 --> 00:29:56.044
I should turn you over to the kerrs
right now and collect that bounty.

382
00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:57.796
So what are you waiting for?

383
00:29:57.879 --> 00:30:03.385
I take pleasure in watching you chase
after things you cannot have.

384
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:05.762
things that are not yours.

385
00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:07.681
You're right. They're not mine.

386
00:30:07.764 --> 00:30:08.890
They belong to the world.

387
00:30:09.558 --> 00:30:10.809
And I'm gonna give them back.

388
00:30:10.892 --> 00:30:12.352
I'm gonna give them all back.

389
00:30:12.436 --> 00:30:13.520
Even yours.

390
00:30:14.604 --> 00:30:16.189
You can't possibly believe that.

391
00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:18.900
You will never get my paintings.

392
00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.611
The world is not worthy of them.

393
00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:27.200
Only a superior people
deserve such fine art.

394
00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:29.953
Oh. Well.

395
00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.665
when you're ready to collect
on that bounty.

396
00:30:33.749 --> 00:30:35.167
you know where to find me.

397
00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:42.466
Your arrogance intrigues me.

398
00:30:43.383 --> 00:30:45.135
Come for my paintings.

399
00:30:46.053 --> 00:30:47.679
And when you fail.

400
00:30:47.763 --> 00:30:49.806
then I'll collect the bounty.

401
00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:51.767
Till then.

402
00:30:53.727 --> 00:30:54.728
Excuse me.

403
00:31:02.069 --> 00:31:03.278
- Hey.
- Hey.

404
00:31:03.362 --> 00:31:04.446
We need to talk.

405
00:31:07.074 --> 00:31:08.158
Are you okay?

406
00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:09.681
- What happened in there?
- I'm fine.

407
00:31:12.996 --> 00:31:16.124
The kerrs are on me. They want payback
for destroying the monet.

408
00:31:16.208 --> 00:31:17.250
Shit.

409
00:31:20.087 --> 00:31:23.548
- And now he knows we're coming.
- Relax. Okay? I got this.

410
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.635
He showed his hand. He has the paintings.

411
00:31:26.718 --> 00:31:28.053
We stick to the plan.

412
00:31:28.136 --> 00:31:32.099
Jesus. what are we walking into here.
Annie? Just be straight with me.

413
00:31:33.225 --> 00:31:35.143
Is this just another syndicate job?

414
00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:38.021
What paintings are we stealing?

415
00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:43.360
A monet. a degas. Picasso. and a Van gogh.

416
00:31:43.443 --> 00:31:44.694
Fuck.

417
00:31:44.778 --> 00:31:47.322
I knew it. Josef's paintings.

418
00:31:49.408 --> 00:31:51.326
We've been through some shit. Annie.

419
00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:55.664
And god knows I owe you. but I ain't ready
to die for some paintings.

420
00:31:55.747 --> 00:31:58.917
Well. I'm not sorry.
because I made a promise.

421
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.836
A promise that I'm willing to die for.

422
00:32:01.461 --> 00:32:03.588
- You know you gotta sit this one out now.
- No. no.

423
00:32:03.672 --> 00:32:05.841
- Annabel. you've been made...
- No! No.

424
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:08.084
You've been made
and it's the only way we move fonnard.

425
00:32:16.017 --> 00:32:19.312
We decided it would be better off
if Annabel didn't come along.

426
00:32:21.314 --> 00:32:23.275
Why the sudden change?

427
00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:27.070
Look. we can't take any chances
on this one. okay?

428
00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:29.656
We think it's best
if I make the plays from here.

429
00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:31.158
keep eyes and ears on everything

430
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:33.201
and if something goes south.
I can bail you out.

431
00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:35.454
Okay. but what's the backup plan?

432
00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:37.289
Lucme?

433
00:32:43.003 --> 00:32:44.212
I can... I can do it.

434
00:32:46.673 --> 00:32:50.051
No. Okay. I can do Annabel's part.

435
00:32:50.135 --> 00:32:51.136
And mine.

436
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.723
Thanks. though. sweetheart.
I appreciate the team effort.

437
00:33:04.483 --> 00:33:06.151
- Holy shit.
- Damn.

438
00:33:07.736 --> 00:33:08.862
I said I got it.

439
00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:10.071
Okay. good.

440
00:33:10.614 --> 00:33:12.866
- There you go. Good job. mama.
- Mm-hmm.

441
00:33:12.949 --> 00:33:14.677
Alright. come on.
Stop fucking around. Let's go.

442
00:33:14.701 --> 00:33:16.495
Focus. That was good. mama.

443
00:33:16.578 --> 00:33:18.705
Show him you can kick his ass.
that's right.

444
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.261
Thank you.

445
00:33:40.894 --> 00:33:42.729
So you think she can handle it?

446
00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:45.774
Yeah. absolutely.

447
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:52.781
You know. I understand
what these paintings mean to you.

448
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.283
No. I don't think you do.

449
00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:58.703
I was 18.

450
00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:02.666
living in the streets.
stealing everything I could

451
00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:05.835
that wasn't nailed to the floor
just to survive.

452
00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:11.174
But I was good at it.

453
00:34:14.928 --> 00:34:19.307
And I'd heard about this old Jewish guy
that had a stash of cash in his safe.

454
00:34:21.518 --> 00:34:22.811
I went there to steal it.

455
00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:27.774
And hanging on the wall in the office
was this painting.

456
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:31.653
It was a renoir.

457
00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:33.071
It was beautiful.

458
00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:38.618
I was just mesmerized by this.
the beauty of this woman in this painting.

459
00:34:38.702 --> 00:34:41.788
It was just visceral.
and so powerful to me.

460
00:34:42.831 --> 00:34:43.999
Did you steal it?

461
00:34:49.087 --> 00:34:50.213
Josef caught you?

462
00:34:51.047 --> 00:34:52.591
Josef saved me.

463
00:34:53.508 --> 00:34:55.510
I don't know how.
but he planned the whole thing.

464
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.523
Josef was like a father to me.

465
00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:11.985
He was my mentor.
He taught me everything I know.

466
00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:18.158
He believed he could heal the world
of all its pain through art.

467
00:35:18.992 --> 00:35:22.662
And he wanted to give back all the beauty
that was stolen by the Nazis.

468
00:35:32.047 --> 00:35:33.423
You think it'll still work?

469
00:35:39.929 --> 00:35:42.599
Those four paintings
belong to Josef's family.

470
00:35:42.682 --> 00:35:46.019
And he spent his whole life
searching for them. so it has to work.

471
00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:49.689
This is the only chance
we're gonna get. Eddie.

472
00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:54.653
We got a big problem.

473
00:36:01.868 --> 00:36:03.870
- Lucille. what's going on?
- They're...

474
00:36:04.663 --> 00:36:05.997
- What?
- They're hackbacking me.

475
00:36:06.081 --> 00:36:07.916
They... they're hacking my system.

476
00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.459
Okay. So... so. what can we do?

477
00:36:09.542 --> 00:36:11.753
- Should we pull the plug or something?
- No. no. no.

478
00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:14.381
If we do that.
I'll-I'll never know who it was.

479
00:36:14.464 --> 00:36:16.525
- what they've seen. what they've taken...
- What if you try to just like to...

480
00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:19.469
Okay. everyone just needs to shut up
and let me work!

481
00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:24.724
That's it. I... yeah. I... they've...

482
00:36:24.808 --> 00:36:27.328
- What's happening?
- Shit. I'm... I'm locked out. They've...

483
00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:30.105
- What?
- They-they changed everything.

484
00:36:30.188 --> 00:36:31.856
They're onto us. They know we're coming.

485
00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:33.024
How?

486
00:36:33.983 --> 00:36:34.984
Fuck!

487
00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:38.446
Shit.

488
00:36:40.532 --> 00:36:41.574
Annabel!

489
00:37:57.901 --> 00:37:58.943
Josef"

490
00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:02.781
I'm so sorry.

491
00:38:11.289 --> 00:38:12.749
Nice.

492
00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:23.218
Eat.

493
00:38:23.301 --> 00:38:24.511
Okay. bro. uh...

494
00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:27.281
Are you gonna...
You gonna hurry up a little bit?

495
00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:28.848
I gotta check my email.

496
00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:30.683
I gotta update my blog.

497
00:38:30.767 --> 00:38:32.811
- You know. I got followers.
- Hey. luce.

498
00:38:33.853 --> 00:38:35.146
Am I reading this right?

499
00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:40.276
Yeah. Yeah. those are the invoices.

500
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.362
I thought you said you were locked out.

501
00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:46.324
No. I am. That's just from the data mine
I did of their servers and cloud.

502
00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:48.493
What's safe domains?

503
00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:51.287
That's the company that services the safe
at the house.

504
00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:56.960
Hold on a second.

505
00:38:57.043 --> 00:38:59.629
The invoices are dated two days ago.

506
00:39:01.798 --> 00:39:02.924
Wait.

507
00:39:03.007 --> 00:39:07.762
The service wasn't done at the house.
It was done at a different address.

508
00:39:07.846 --> 00:39:09.722
Do you think he moved the paintings?

509
00:39:09.806 --> 00:39:11.140
I mean. it would make sense to.

510
00:39:11.224 --> 00:39:12.851
If he knew we knew where they were.

511
00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:14.912
Yeah. there's the threat of us
alerting the authorities.

512
00:39:14.936 --> 00:39:16.354
- Guys...
- And a guy like huizen

513
00:39:16.437 --> 00:39:17.623
- would be threatened by that.
- Guys...

514
00:39:17.647 --> 00:39:19.375
- I mean. he'd need something bigger.
- Guys!

515
00:39:19.399 --> 00:39:20.275
What?

516
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:24.404
A moving company specializing
in the crating and packaging of fine arts

517
00:39:24.487 --> 00:39:26.239
was at the house the next day.

518
00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:29.993
- Where's the address?
- Right here in downtown la.

519
00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:34.330
What?! Oh. my god! Yes! Yes!

520
00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:36.749
Good job. Nadia. we in business. baby.

521
00:39:36.833 --> 00:39:38.501
- Yes.
- We have some work to do.

522
00:39:38.585 --> 00:39:40.169
- Alright.
- Good. good.

523
00:39:40.253 --> 00:39:43.506
'Cause I was this close to finding myself
another team.

524
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.842
Can I check my. uh. email?

525
00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:47.969
Update my blog? You good?

526
00:39:48.636 --> 00:39:51.306
- Oh...
- No? I can do it later.

527
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.990
Annabel. I just...
I just wanted to apologize.

528
00:40:09.073 --> 00:40:11.659
I don't know how they found me
in their network.

529
00:40:11.743 --> 00:40:13.223
I don't blame you.

530
00:40:13.494 --> 00:40:15.163
- Lucy. it wasn't your fault.
- I just...

531
00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.390
- What do you mean?
- I don't know what happened.

532
00:40:16.414 --> 00:40:18.054
They should have never known I was there.

533
00:40:19.042 --> 00:40:20.126
Lucy. don't worry about it.

534
00:40:20.209 --> 00:40:22.503
- We're gonna be okay. Alright?
- Come on. Annabel.

535
00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:23.856
- Yo.
- Seriously. what the hell?

536
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.007
- Leave it alone. It's fine.
- Oh. fuck that.

537
00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.110
You can't let her think she messed up.
It wasn't her fault.

538
00:40:28.134 --> 00:40:30.054
- Yo. you guys want tacos?
- It's not gonna help.

539
00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:33.222
Bullshit. Her confidence is shaken.
We need her solid.

540
00:40:33.306 --> 00:40:36.142
Since when the fuck do you give a shit
about her feelings?

541
00:40:36.225 --> 00:40:39.065
Alright. someone tell me what the hell
is going on right now. or I walk.

542
00:40:39.562 --> 00:40:41.356
- They didn't find you. Lucille.
- Don't.

543
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.024
They found her.

544
00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.317
What?

545
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.194
She was made two days ago.

546
00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:48.101
Huizen cornered her.

547
00:40:48.154 --> 00:40:50.865
There's a bounty on her head
for the last job we botched.

548
00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:54.369
Oh... that's why you're not coming.

549
00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:56.204
- Lucy. wait.
- Annabel. what the fuck?!

550
00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.873
I thought this job was gonna be different
than the last?!

551
00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:05.630
I told you nothing good
would come out of that.

552
00:41:11.344 --> 00:41:12.887
People are crazy.

553
00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:16.140
Luce. Luce. slow down.

554
00:41:16.891 --> 00:41:17.892
Hey.

555
00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:21.562
- Can you wait up? Luce?
- What?

556
00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:23.231
I... what are you doing?

557
00:41:23.856 --> 00:41:24.983
Please come back.

558
00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.694
Come back. Wow. Okay.

559
00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:30.738
- Okay.
- I-I need a minute.

560
00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:32.949
Okay. let's... let's take one.

561
00:41:40.999 --> 00:41:43.835
You... You broke me. Eddie.

562
00:41:46.379 --> 00:41:48.256
- You broke me.
- I know. I'm...

563
00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:51.759
I'm sorry.

564
00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:54.095
I was scared and...

565
00:41:54.846 --> 00:41:56.639
- I wasn't ready...
- Okay. cut the bullshit.

566
00:41:56.723 --> 00:41:57.807
Look. there's...

567
00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:03.396
There's nothing I can say right now
that's gonna make anything better. okay?

568
00:42:05.732 --> 00:42:08.860
When Annabel wanted to come get you. I...
I didn't fight her.

569
00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:10.987
Okay? I didn't fight her. I...

570
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.656
I thought. that if I saw you again...

571
00:42:16.242 --> 00:42:17.882
I thought that I could make things right.

572
00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:21.205
But this is bigger than us.

573
00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:23.833
And we can't do it without you.

574
00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:27.253
- You know... god. I...
- What?

575
00:42:27.336 --> 00:42:28.963
- I knew I couldn't trust her.
- Hey.

576
00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:32.216
You can trust me.

577
00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:37.388
Yeah. well. I hope you're right.

578
00:42:56.574 --> 00:42:57.617
Lucille...

579
00:42:59.494 --> 00:43:00.536
I'm sorry.

580
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.414
I'm so sorry.

581
00:43:08.336 --> 00:43:11.047
I want to apologize to all of you. I...

582
00:43:13.883 --> 00:43:16.010
This job is not like any otherjob.

583
00:43:17.053 --> 00:43:19.764
Each one of you
is the best at what you do.

584
00:43:19.847 --> 00:43:21.182
I chose you.

585
00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.518
I chose you.

586
00:43:26.479 --> 00:43:29.107
We're trying to right a wrong
against humanity.

587
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.859
and Josef believed that.
and I believe that.

588
00:43:32.652 --> 00:43:35.404
And I'm putting my faith and trust
in each of you.

589
00:43:36.364 --> 00:43:38.825
You're my team. I need you.

590
00:43:40.326 --> 00:43:41.994
I can't do this without you.

591
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:48.084
Okay.

592
00:43:48.876 --> 00:43:50.086
Okay. I'll stay.

593
00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:52.755
I'm still here.

594
00:43:56.592 --> 00:43:57.635
Nadia?

595
00:43:59.095 --> 00:44:03.683
I'm in. just don't hide anything
from us anymore. Okay?

596
00:44:04.267 --> 00:44:05.268
Please.

597
00:44:08.396 --> 00:44:09.939
Agh...

598
00:44:10.022 --> 00:44:11.440
I mean. look. that...

599
00:44:12.733 --> 00:44:15.820
Killer speech. killer speech.

600
00:44:16.529 --> 00:44:19.615
Now. I hate Nazis
as much as the next guy. but. um...

601
00:44:21.409 --> 00:44:23.911
But how much are these paintings
actually worth?

602
00:44:24.662 --> 00:44:26.247
They're priceless.

603
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.623
Priceless?

604
00:44:27.707 --> 00:44:32.628
Wow. I mean. that's...
That's a pretty big payday. no?

605
00:44:32.712 --> 00:44:35.756
Well. you're already being compensated
pretty generously.

606
00:44:36.382 --> 00:44:37.425
Right.

607
00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:39.552
But by the sounds of it.

608
00:44:40.678 --> 00:44:43.389
priceless could be a whole lot more. no?

609
00:44:43.472 --> 00:44:44.932
Well. that's not what this is about.

610
00:44:46.851 --> 00:44:49.729
Does anybody else feel like this?

611
00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:52.773
- Huh?
- Nah. I'm good.

612
00:44:53.774 --> 00:44:56.194
Okay.

613
00:44:56.277 --> 00:44:59.655
Oh. so it's just... just me.

614
00:44:59.739 --> 00:45:02.992
Alright. Never mind. We're good.

615
00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:10.625
So the building has ip cameras all over.
inside and out.

616
00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:13.961
Here we go. There's one right here. Here.

617
00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:16.297
Um. won't they catch you hacking
into the system?

618
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.423
Not this time.

619
00:45:17.506 --> 00:45:19.342
I've doubled the number of times
I've rerouted

620
00:45:19.425 --> 00:45:20.718
as well as doubled my layers.

621
00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:23.054
It'll take them forever
to find me this time.

622
00:45:23.137 --> 00:45:26.224
Plus. I'm not in their network.
I'm just watching the cameras.

623
00:45:26.307 --> 00:45:27.725
You haven't pwned them again?

624
00:45:27.808 --> 00:45:29.310
Funny. No.

625
00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:34.190
Uh. so. so far I've counted
at least ten different guards.

626
00:45:34.273 --> 00:45:35.918
That's more than double
what was at the house.

627
00:45:35.942 --> 00:45:38.486
Not only is that more.
these guys are dangerous.

628
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:41.739
I've done some facial recognition.
and most of these guys are in the system.

629
00:45:41.822 --> 00:45:43.241
- Ex-cons?
- Worse.

630
00:45:43.324 --> 00:45:46.327
Ex-ksk. kommando spezialkrafte.

631
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.204
German special forces.

632
00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:51.332
The more the merrier. if you ask me.

633
00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:54.460
Easy. The minute one of those guards
sounds the alarm. we're screwed.

634
00:45:54.543 --> 00:45:57.213
Okay. So not a standard smash and grab?

635
00:45:57.296 --> 00:45:59.382
No. it's not. Not this time. Uh-uh.

636
00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:02.218
So how are we gonna get in?

637
00:46:02.301 --> 00:46:03.761
Here.

638
00:46:03.844 --> 00:46:04.929
This garage door.

639
00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.141
Is that for special delivery?

640
00:46:09.225 --> 00:46:11.686
Yeah. Shell game on the way out.

641
00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:13.813
Okay. That works.

642
00:46:14.939 --> 00:46:16.440
But I think we're gonna need more.

643
00:46:16.524 --> 00:46:17.566
What do you mean?

644
00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.236
Well. I mean.
we're going by assumption here.

645
00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:22.196
He could be playing us.
This could be a trap.

646
00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.864
We need confirmation.

647
00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.468
What do you think. luce?
Can you get us anything more?

648
00:46:26.492 --> 00:46:30.579
Well. I'm not in his network anymore.
but I've got an idea.

649
00:46:30.663 --> 00:46:31.956
Who you calling?

650
00:46:32.581 --> 00:46:34.250
A girlfriend who owes me a favor.

651
00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:36.168
Yeah. Would... would I like her?

652
00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:40.881
Stupid.

653
00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.504
I've never seen you here before.

654
00:47:20.588 --> 00:47:22.131
Oh. we come here all the time.

655
00:47:22.214 --> 00:47:24.633
No. I come here all the time.

656
00:47:25.468 --> 00:47:30.097
I'm sure I would've seen two such
beautiful creatures such as yourself.

657
00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:33.267
Oh. you got me. This is our first time.

658
00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:36.520
but a friend told me that these
were the best martinis in la.

659
00:47:36.604 --> 00:47:38.397
so we had to try them.

660
00:47:38.481 --> 00:47:40.649
Ah. I heard they do the trick.

661
00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:47.281
- Who's your friend?
- Hmm.

662
00:47:47.948 --> 00:47:52.370
- This is Francesca. and I'm Angie.
- Ah.

663
00:47:53.287 --> 00:47:55.623
- It's a pleasure to meet you both.
- Mm.

664
00:47:57.583 --> 00:47:59.335
And you are mister...?

665
00:47:59.418 --> 00:48:01.420
Oh. please. You call me Otto.

666
00:48:01.504 --> 00:48:05.049
Otto? That is an adorable name

667
00:48:05.132 --> 00:48:09.261
- for such a powerful-looking man.
- Mm-hmm.

668
00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:12.973
Otto. maybe you can help us settle
a disagreement we're having.

669
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:15.226
- Angie here. um...
- Of course.

670
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:16.909
Doesn't think she looks good tonight.

671
00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:18.854
But don't you think she looks beautiful?

672
00:48:20.022 --> 00:48:21.065
Well...

673
00:48:25.403 --> 00:48:27.863
- No more so than yourself.
- Uh-huh.

674
00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:32.118
And incredibly sexy.
if I'm not being too fonnard.

675
00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:33.828
Oh. thank you.

676
00:48:33.911 --> 00:48:35.287
You should have seen me earlier.

677
00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:37.998
- I was a hot mess.
- She was a mess.

678
00:48:38.082 --> 00:48:41.419
- But Francesca here helped me get ready.
- That's right.

679
00:48:41.502 --> 00:48:43.838
I would say she's quite the artist.

680
00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:45.001
- Don't you think?
- Artist?

681
00:48:46.257 --> 00:48:48.717
Was she your. uh. she your canvas?

682
00:48:48.801 --> 00:48:50.719
Maybe.

683
00:48:50.803 --> 00:48:53.347
Are you... are you a connoisseur?

684
00:48:54.432 --> 00:48:56.892
I know what I like when I see it.

685
00:48:56.976 --> 00:48:58.310
Hmm.

686
00:48:58.394 --> 00:49:00.271
Do you like what you see now?

687
00:49:00.354 --> 00:49:05.443
I have seen the most beautiful art
the world has ever known.

688
00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:10.614
And you both come
into a very close... second.

689
00:49:10.698 --> 00:49:12.783
- Oh. come on.
- Oh. second?

690
00:49:12.867 --> 00:49:15.661
Where have you seen art
more beautiful than us?

691
00:49:15.744 --> 00:49:17.788
- I own it.
- Oh.

692
00:49:17.872 --> 00:49:20.249
Like. you mean. like. a gallery?

693
00:49:20.875 --> 00:49:24.837
More of a private collection
here in Los Angeles.

694
00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.756
- Oh. Can we. uh. can we see it?
- Can we see it? Mm.

695
00:49:28.299 --> 00:49:32.219
Like I said. it's a private collection.

696
00:49:33.012 --> 00:49:36.599
One only fit for an Aryan people.

697
00:49:36.682 --> 00:49:39.101
of which you are not.

698
00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:43.522
Good night. ladies.

699
00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:56.952
God. he's such a pig.

700
00:49:58.037 --> 00:50:00.557
- Oh. he's got them here in la. alright.
- What else did he say?

701
00:50:00.623 --> 00:50:03.751
He wouldn't stop bragging
about his private downtown collection.

702
00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:08.005
He wouldn't let us see it. though.
He said... he said we weren't worthy.

703
00:50:08.088 --> 00:50:11.008
Yeah. That sounds like him.

704
00:50:11.091 --> 00:50:12.968
You did good. luce. You did good.

705
00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:14.887
- Thanks.
- Oh...

706
00:50:15.596 --> 00:50:16.597
You okay?

707
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.933
- Yeah.
- You look good.

708
00:50:20.017 --> 00:50:21.101
Hey. guys.

709
00:50:22.019 --> 00:50:23.020
Focus.

710
00:50:23.896 --> 00:50:26.232
Alright. Nadia. Bruno. you guys are up.

711
00:50:26.315 --> 00:50:27.441
Let's do it.

712
00:50:28.192 --> 00:50:29.318
Come on. come on.

713
00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:30.629
- We'll work on that.
- Let's go.

714
00:50:30.653 --> 00:50:32.029
Ah. shit.

715
00:50:37.159 --> 00:50:38.202
Nathan!

716
00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:46.961
- It's Victoria.
- I'm sorry?

717
00:50:47.044 --> 00:50:48.963
We met at my architecture firm.

718
00:50:49.046 --> 00:50:51.066
where you lied your way in
to steal some blueprints.

719
00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:53.884
Um. I'm not quite sure I know
what you're talking about.

720
00:50:54.677 --> 00:50:56.303
You think you're pretty slick?

721
00:50:56.387 --> 00:50:58.973
We have security cameras.
I saw you go into the file room.

722
00:51:00.015 --> 00:51:01.934
Well. that's... that's quite a story.

723
00:51:02.935 --> 00:51:04.937
Don't worry. I didn't tell anyone.

724
00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.398
I deleted the security footage.

725
00:51:07.481 --> 00:51:09.858
Really? Why?

726
00:51:09.942 --> 00:51:12.987
Architecture isn't too terribly exciting.

727
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.282
Plus. I might have a weakness
for Latin men.

728
00:51:18.701 --> 00:51:19.743
Is that so?

729
00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:22.496
So what else are you into?

730
00:51:28.961 --> 00:51:31.297
This thing's not gonna zap me. is it?

731
00:51:32.047 --> 00:51:35.134
It's not broadcasting any signals.
It's listening for one.

732
00:51:35.217 --> 00:51:36.218
You know what?

733
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:40.514
I bet he's got
more than just paintings in there.

734
00:51:40.598 --> 00:51:43.183
Yeah. I bet he's got like gold
or some shit.

735
00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:45.102
- Gold?
- Mm-hmm.

736
00:51:45.185 --> 00:51:46.687
No one deals with gold anymore.

737
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.983
No. you bet your ass
a guy like huizen? He's got gold.

738
00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:53.003
Well. you know what?
Then you could come back and Rob him.

739
00:51:53.027 --> 00:51:55.154
Right now. we're not checking for no gold.

740
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:59.491
Shit. If I find gold. I'm taking it.

741
00:52:01.285 --> 00:52:05.456
Do you know how heavy gold
worth stealing is?

742
00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:08.834
- You won't get too far.
- Hey. hey. hey. hey. wait.

743
00:52:08.917 --> 00:52:09.960
It's opening.

744
00:52:10.669 --> 00:52:12.671
Oh. yeah. I'm picking up the frequency.

745
00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:14.798
- You getting it?
- Hang on.

746
00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:16.550
Agh. you're gonna miss it.

747
00:52:16.634 --> 00:52:18.385
- I'm getting it.
- Hey. it's getting close.

748
00:52:18.469 --> 00:52:19.779
- You're gonna miss it.
- I got it.

749
00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:21.388
Yeah?

750
00:52:22.723 --> 00:52:24.433
- Let's go.
- Woo. Easy.

751
00:52:26.435 --> 00:52:27.978
Alright. done.

752
00:52:28.062 --> 00:52:29.396
That'll open the garage door.

753
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:33.192
Okay. I'll override the cameras looping
in the street while you guys get in.

754
00:52:33.275 --> 00:52:35.653
What if there's guards
waiting in the garage?

755
00:52:35.736 --> 00:52:38.697
Tsk. Ah. you should leave that
to me. yeah?

756
00:52:39.615 --> 00:52:41.617
Uh. yeah. Uh. no.

757
00:52:43.661 --> 00:52:45.037
No guns.

758
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.664
- What?
- Yeah. no guns.

759
00:52:46.747 --> 00:52:48.666
- Wait. wait. Are you for real?
- Yeah.

760
00:52:49.541 --> 00:52:51.710
You heard what she said
about those guys. right?

761
00:52:51.794 --> 00:52:54.088
They're not messing around.
so...

762
00:52:54.672 --> 00:52:57.591
I said no guns.

763
00:52:57.675 --> 00:52:59.343
- You got that?
- My man.

764
00:52:59.426 --> 00:53:02.763
- we're thieves. not killers.
- Exactly.

765
00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.446
This motherfucker's gonna get us killed.

766
00:53:11.814 --> 00:53:12.898
Thank you.

767
00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:19.405
The syndicate does not condone guns
or murder. and neither do I.

768
00:53:21.156 --> 00:53:23.367
That's just fine.

769
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:27.746
But any friction.
I'm gonna handle things my way.

770
00:53:27.830 --> 00:53:28.831
Yeah?

771
00:53:49.351 --> 00:53:50.894
Alright. everyone ready to go?

772
00:53:51.979 --> 00:53:53.188
Let's do a comms check.

773
00:53:59.945 --> 00:54:01.572
Annabel. you read me?

774
00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:05.617
Okay. I'm starting recording.

775
00:54:19.631 --> 00:54:22.801
Okay. Cameras are looping.
You're invisible.

776
00:54:38.984 --> 00:54:41.487
Alright. here we go.
Fingers crossed.

777
00:54:43.322 --> 00:54:44.762
Jefe. why is it not working?

778
00:54:46.408 --> 00:54:48.702
Fuck. This is gonna be
a short trip. huh? Awesome.

779
00:54:48.786 --> 00:54:50.245
No. no. no. no. no. no.

780
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.131
There we go.

781
00:55:01.215 --> 00:55:02.424
Hell. yeah. girl.

782
00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:03.967
We're in.

783
00:56:18.959 --> 00:56:20.460
Okay. we split up.

784
00:56:20.544 --> 00:56:22.754
Radio silence till you find the safe.

785
00:56:22.838 --> 00:56:24.298
Stay out of sight.

786
00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:25.591
You two. go. Come on.

787
00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:16.141
Holy shit. This is it.

788
00:57:16.224 --> 00:57:17.476
Yeah? How do you know?

789
00:57:17.559 --> 00:57:19.269
It has a biometric lock.

790
00:57:20.479 --> 00:57:22.230
What the hell does that mean?

791
00:57:22.314 --> 00:57:24.066
It means it needs a fingerprint.

792
00:57:24.149 --> 00:57:25.589
Oh. can you open it?

793
00:57:28.153 --> 00:57:29.571
Hold up.

794
00:57:32.449 --> 00:57:33.492
Keep going.

795
00:58:05.774 --> 00:58:07.275
What the hell did you do that for?

796
00:58:07.359 --> 00:58:08.443
You were taking too long.

797
00:58:08.527 --> 00:58:10.362
I had him right where I wanted him.

798
00:58:11.196 --> 00:58:12.531
Let me get that gun.

799
00:58:13.615 --> 00:58:14.908
No guns. remember?

800
00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:18.537
I kicked his ass though.

801
00:58:33.844 --> 00:58:36.221
- Goddammit!
- Oh. my goodness. I'm so sorry.

802
00:58:36.304 --> 00:58:40.225
It's been so long since I've worn heels.
and I've had just a little too much.

803
00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:42.269
I'm fine.

804
00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:45.939
Clean that. Dry it!

805
00:59:26.605 --> 00:59:27.939
Do you copy?

806
00:59:28.732 --> 00:59:30.692
Lucille? Do you copy?

807
00:59:33.653 --> 00:59:35.322
Hey. two guards are approaching.

808
01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.165
Holy shit.

809
01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.127
That's not a safe.

810
01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:32.169
Nope.

811
01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:35.382
That's a fucking vault.

812
01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.553
I knew he had more
than just paintings in there.

813
01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.054
Can you open it?

814
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.475
I guess we'll have to find out. right?

815
01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:50.772
Where...

816
01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:52.917
- Hey. Where do we go? Yeah. yeah. yeah.
- Eddie.

817
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:54.210
- Hold on.
- Head up to the eighth floor.

818
01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:55.235
Come on. come on.

819
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.218
That's not a safe.

820
01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:22.637
Really? We hadn't noticed.

821
01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:24.514
Can you open it?

822
01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.976
I've always wanted to use this.

823
01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.079
Nadia. whatever you're gonna do.
you gotta do it fast.

824
01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:33.356
Oh. hold up. hold up. Is that nuclear?

825
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.251
No. no. no. no. no.
This is a rare earth magnet.

826
01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:36.651
It's made out of neodymium.

827
01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:40.655
Once turned into an alloy with iron
and boron. it becomes magnetized.

828
01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:43.325
Science lesson later.
We gotta get this open right now.

829
01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:46.453
Okay. Just give me one second. Okay.

830
01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:51.791
Speed it up. Nadia. Come on.

831
01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:58.983
I'm trying to find this.

832
01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:01.009
- Come on. come on. come on.
- Give me more time.

833
01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:04.512
We gotta keep the guards away.
What do you got for a diversion?

834
01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:05.931
Hmm. I'll improvise.

835
01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:09.160
- I'll go with him.
- No. luce. no.

836
01:02:09.184 --> 01:02:11.269
- No. no. I need to help him.
- No.

837
01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:12.520
I'll be fine.

838
01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:46.691
You're just full of surprises. aren't you?

839
01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:47.973
Let's go. let's go. let's go.

840
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.477
Shit. I forgot my stethoscope.

841
01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:56.147
Alright. Yeah. Okay.

842
01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:58.066
Alright.

843
01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:01.528
Here we come. Let's get this bad boy.

844
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.868
Now what?

845
01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:11.162
- I'm looking for the solenoid.
- The what?

846
01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:15.417
When you enter a passcode.
the keypad sends a signal to the solenoid.

847
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.669
The signal then passes
through a magnetic field

848
01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:19.754
converting it to a mechanical movement.

849
01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:22.173
If the magnets hit the field.

850
01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:25.302
it causes the locks to unlock.

851
01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.782
But it'll go faster
if you help me move. okay? Just...

852
01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.246
- Yeah. No. no. yeah. of course. My bad.
- Give me a second...

853
01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:37.814
What's the word?

854
01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:39.733
Just give me one second.

855
01:03:40.358 --> 01:03:41.735
Guys. we don't have enough time.

856
01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.778
Yeah. just give me one second. please.

857
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.342
Come on. come on. come on.

858
01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:51.328
Whoo!

859
01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:55.999
Ladies and gents. the treasure.

860
01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:25.862
- Good old sparky.
- Seriously?

861
01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:28.823
All that technology. huh.
and you're just gonna use a saw?

862
01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:31.868
You always gotta go back to the basics.

863
01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:43.022
Holy shit.

864
01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:46.734
They're beautiful.

865
01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:49.279
Look at this motherfucker.

866
01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:51.489
Just the paintings.

867
01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.689
Dry it! Give it back to me!

868
01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:29.402
Give me that!

869
01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:39.871
Where are the guards?

870
01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:45.168
Annabel.

871
01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:49.005
you have foolishly put
your people in danger.

872
01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:50.215
And for what?

873
01:06:50.924 --> 01:06:53.510
Now. you will suffer for your insolence.

874
01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:55.386
Go! Go!

875
01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:57.305
Get the hell out of there right now!

876
01:06:57.388 --> 01:06:59.224
Huizen is on his way. Hurry up!

877
01:06:59.307 --> 01:07:00.683
We gotta go.

878
01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:04.354
No. no. no. no. I don't think so. I...

879
01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:06.731
I'm gonna be the one walking out
with those paintings.

880
01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:09.859
- What's the matter?
- Call it an insurance policy.

881
01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:11.986
I carry them.
I either get away or I don't.

882
01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:13.821
You carry them. get nabbed or dropped.

883
01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:15.299
- I get nothing.
- No. Stick to the plan.

884
01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:16.717
Alright. we don't have time for this shit.

885
01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:19.202
No. no. no. no.
I'm not leaving without those paintings.

886
01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:23.706
- Just give it to him. it's fine.
- Yeah.

887
01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.961
- Happy?
- Yeah. I'm happy.

888
01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:47.605
Split up! Move!

889
01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:49.941
Shit.

890
01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:40.051
- Go. Go. go.
- Okay.

891
01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.240
Fuck!

892
01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:10.915
Shit.

893
01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.253
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

894
01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.338
I've just been shot!

895
01:10:59.005 --> 01:11:01.466
- Nadia! Nadia. Nadia! What happened?
- Come on.

896
01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:04.385
- They shot me! They fucking shot me!
- Okay. okay. Hold on. hold on.

897
01:11:04.469 --> 01:11:05.720
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

898
01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:07.013
- Fuck!
- Let's go!

899
01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.307
Go. go. go. go!

900
01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:15.980
- Hurry. hurry.
- Shit.

901
01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:19.066
We gotta go. Go. go. go. go. go.

902
01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:24.405
Freeze! Hold it! Hold it! Don't move!

903
01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.743
- Drop it.
- Okay.

904
01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:29.911
Drop it. now!

905
01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:31.579
- Back the fuck up!
- Okay.

906
01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:33.706
Eddie. get in the car.

907
01:11:36.918 --> 01:11:37.960
Hurry up!

908
01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:45.009
Jesus!

909
01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:48.054
Let's go! Eddie. let's go! Go!

910
01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.348
- What the fuck?!
- Fuck!

911
01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:06.447
Just hold on.

912
01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:40.773
Okay. I got it. I got it.

913
01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:42.358
I got it. I got it. I got it.

914
01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:43.609
Okay. just hold on.

915
01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:52.785
Okay. Nadia. you're alright.

916
01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:56.664
Come on. up in this chair.
Get me the first aid kit.

917
01:12:56.747 --> 01:12:58.416
- Where?
- It's right there. Right there.

918
01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:00.710
Let me see. mama. That's right.
You're okay.

919
01:13:00.793 --> 01:13:02.795
- Let me look at it. Let me look at it.
- Yeah.

920
01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.065
- Press it.
- First aid. Look...

921
01:13:05.089 --> 01:13:06.650
- I think it's okay.
- What the hell was that?!

922
01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:07.967
Oh. my god! Fuck.

923
01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.303
What about your little no-gun rule. huh?

924
01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:12.226
- Hey. hey. hey.
- Why did you kill that guard?

925
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:14.432
Why did you kill that guard?!

926
01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:16.684
- Everybody. just shut the fuck up!
- Annie?!

927
01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:18.370
- Quiet! Quiet!
- What the hell were you thinking?!

928
01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.229
We don't do that! That's not us!

929
01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:23.232
Okay. You're alright. You're alright.

930
01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:25.651
We go to the syndicate
and tell them what happened.

931
01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:28.237
No! You know they'll have nothing
to do with this.

932
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:30.615
Annabel. you said they were priceless.

933
01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:32.134
- Sell them to the highest bidder.
- No.

934
01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:35.161
Selling stolen art is the quickest way
to get busted. even on the dark web.

935
01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.913
- We can't do that.
- Then what?

936
01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:40.124
Then what?!

937
01:13:40.207 --> 01:13:41.292
Fuck.

938
01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:44.378
- We destroy them.
- No.

939
01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:45.671
- Yes.
- No way! Not again.

940
01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:47.590
- Yes!
- No. Ransom.

941
01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:49.759
- We demand a ransom from the Nazis.
- No.

942
01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:52.428
No. Josef would have never wanted that.

943
01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:57.516
Josef? I'm so done giving a shit
about Josef and your little cause.

944
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.852
Alright? You just shot a guard
in cold blood.

945
01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.062
You did that.

946
01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:04.482
Now me. I'm gonna get paid
one way or another.

947
01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.025
Alright?

948
01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.033
Hey. Annabel.

949
01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:07.044
Hey. guys.

950
01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.381
He said he'd meet later today.

951
01:15:16.303 --> 01:15:17.346
Where are you going?

952
01:15:19.473 --> 01:15:20.808
Tsk. So close.

953
01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:23.436
Uh. I got some errands to run.
Is that okay with you guys?

954
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:28.899
- The paintings?
- Yeah. like I trust any of you.

955
01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:30.192
Especially you.

956
01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:33.738
Whoa. whoa. We can't just let you
walk out of here with that.

957
01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:37.074
- I'm coming.
- Yeah. I don't... I don't care.

958
01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:38.242
See you later.

959
01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:50.629
What the hell are we doing?

960
01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:52.024
Gotta unload something real quick.

961
01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:53.382
I thought you quit.

962
01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:56.677
Agh. No. Just out collecting.

963
01:15:57.344 --> 01:15:59.597
I got something you want.

964
01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:04.185
Boom.

965
01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:05.936
What do you think?

966
01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:10.608
Where'd you get this?

967
01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.568
It's pretty nice. huh?

968
01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:14.945
I'm gonna ask you again.
Where'd you get it?

969
01:16:15.029 --> 01:16:17.239
- Does it matter?
- Hell. yes. it matters.

970
01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:19.283
It's my ass that's on the line.

971
01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:22.244
Okay. Look. old man.
I know you know people. all right?

972
01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:24.288
I know you got buyers for shit like this.

973
01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:28.042
I do.

974
01:16:31.337 --> 01:16:33.047
- What the hell?
- Calm down.

975
01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:38.928
That's what I'm talking about. Mm.

976
01:16:40.971 --> 01:16:42.807
Smells so good.

977
01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:44.058
One ain't enough.

978
01:16:44.683 --> 01:16:46.102
They're gonna want more.

979
01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:50.106
No worries. gramps.
Plenty more where that came from.

980
01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.441
Let's roll.

981
01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:06.163
Something's not right.

982
01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:08.791
He should be here by now.

983
01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:12.878
I'm gonna go find the others.

984
01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:19.260
Listen. Try and stay out of trouble. huh?

985
01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:53.669
Where is she?

986
01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:56.672
I'm sure she's around.

987
01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:02.928
You are either incredibly brave
or incredibly stupid.

988
01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.723
I'm the one who's here. ain't I?

989
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.478
Tell me why I don't just shoot you
where you stand and take what is mine.

990
01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:15.691
Maybe there's a gun on you right now.

991
01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.986
Maybe if you kill me.

992
01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:21.739
the cops will be here
before you make it out with your car.

993
01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:27.870
You have no idea
how much those are worth. do you?

994
01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:30.789
I figure... a million?

995
01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.210
More than enough to live
a pretty damn good life.

996
01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:37.463
A million? Yeah.

997
01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.672
Is that all?

998
01:18:43.594 --> 01:18:44.887
What is this?

999
01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.555
That's an account number. chief.

1000
01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:50.726
Sure you got a team of bankers
on speed dial.

1001
01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:53.604
Fine.

1002
01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:55.397
Now. I'll take my paintings.

1003
01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:12.498
Sorry about your guy.

1004
01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:14.583
My guy?

1005
01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:18.379
Yeah. I mean. you know how these things go
sometimes. right?

1006
01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:19.838
Shoot or get shot.

1007
01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.386
I think we have a problem here.

1008
01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:27.513
Yeah. and what's that?

1009
01:19:29.515 --> 01:19:31.433
None of my guards were shot.

1010
01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:34.353
Bullshit. I saw him go down.

1011
01:19:35.562 --> 01:19:37.564
And these are not my paintings.

1012
01:19:38.691 --> 01:19:41.652
What are you talking about?
They... they are.

1013
01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:46.615
I don't believe that monet or Van gogh
bought their canvases from a hobby store.

1014
01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:52.746
Son of a bitch.

1015
01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:57.876
They switched bags on me.

1016
01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:58.961
Alright. uh...

1017
01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:03.299
To steal my paintings is one thing.

1018
01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:07.469
But to steal my gold.
that's a grave mistake.

1019
01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:12.349
What-what are you talking about?
I'm trying to bring your shit back to you.

1020
01:20:12.433 --> 01:20:15.269
You know what they used to do to thieves
in Nazi Germany?

1021
01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:34.038
- Miss Gomez?
- Yes?

1022
01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:38.125
The museum is immensely grateful
for your donation.

1023
01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:41.587
It has always been believed
that these works were lost forever.

1024
01:20:42.796 --> 01:20:46.300
May I ask. how did they come to be
in your possession?

1025
01:20:46.383 --> 01:20:47.509
I own them.

1026
01:20:47.593 --> 01:20:50.971
They were given to me
by the original owner. Josef Goodman.

1027
01:20:51.055 --> 01:20:52.806
He was a holocaust survivor.

1028
01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:59.104
These are the original ownership papers
and letters of authorship

1029
01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:01.065
from the artists themselves.

1030
01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:04.985
- May I?
- Yes.

1031
01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:11.116
My goodness.

1032
01:21:13.827 --> 01:21:18.999
We will. of course.
have to examine these for authenticity.

1033
01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:20.876
Of course. of course.

1034
01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.796
I know they're real and I'm sure
you'll find that to be true as well.

1035
01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:27.758
Thank you.

1036
01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:40.521
Those are my paintings.

1037
01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:48.862
I would love to see you tell that
to the authorities.

1038
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.324
Keep them.

1039
01:21:53.033 --> 01:21:54.701
I was tired of them anyway.

1040
01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:56.453
- Is that so?
- Mm.

1041
01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:00.499
How did you do it?

1042
01:22:01.625 --> 01:22:05.087
How did you allow that fool
to bring me those fakes?

1043
01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:16.056
I'm not leaving without those paintings.

1044
01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:17.558
Just give it to him. it's fine.

1045
01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:22.354
- Drop it. Drop it. now!
- Okay. okay.

1046
01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:23.439
Hurry up.

1047
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:30.612
We're good. right?

1048
01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:36.076
Yeah. we're good.

1049
01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:40.747
Every time you walk into that vault.

1050
01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:43.375
and see four empty spaces on the wall.

1051
01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:45.419
I want you to wonder.

1052
01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:47.379
how did she do it?

1053
01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:53.177
How did my team walk out of your vault
with these four paintings?

1054
01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:57.097
You think you've gotten away
with something so grand here?

1055
01:22:58.056 --> 01:23:00.767
These paintings are nothing compared
to my other treasures.

1056
01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:03.854
pieces far greater in value
and significance

1057
01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.939
than... than some old canvases.

1058
01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:10.068
I'm sure. And we're coming for all of it.

1059
01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:14.698
And we won't stop
until we get every last piece

1060
01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:16.658
and give it back to the world.

1061
01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:20.787
I'm not so sure you'll get a chance.

1062
01:23:21.788 --> 01:23:25.918
It's time now for me to collect the bounty
from the kerrs.

1063
01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:30.631
Well. like I said.
you know where to find me.

1064
01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:35.469
But until you do. I have some friends
who would love to speak to you.

1065
01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.185
Oh. look at this.

1066
01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:49.066
You can't hide her forever.

1067
01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:54.696
I've seen what you're willing to risk
for some old paintings.

1068
01:23:55.489 --> 01:24:00.244
But what is a mother willing to risk
for the safety of her own child?

1069
01:24:02.412 --> 01:24:03.497
Trust me.

1070
01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:06.542
You don't wanna fucking know.

1071
01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:11.797
Mr. Huizen.
would you come with us. please?

1072
01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.840
What is this about?

1073
01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:15.342
These treasures of yours.

1074
01:24:15.425 --> 01:24:18.887
We have some questions for you
regarding documentation of ownership

1075
01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:20.597
and whether or not you've paid taxes.

1076
01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:21.890
Right this way.

1077
01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:26.311
Hey. Annabel?

1078
01:24:26.395 --> 01:24:27.729
- Yeah?
- Can I ask you something?

1079
01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:29.958
Where'd you get the fingerprints?

1080
01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.459
And how'd you know
we were gonna need them?

1081
01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:33.235
Sorry. That was... that was me.

1082
01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:37.114
Yeah. I. uh. I overheard him bragging
about all his treasures.

1083
01:24:37.197 --> 01:24:40.909
and how he keeps them well-protected
with guards and biometrics

1084
01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:43.203
and the state-ofâthe-art safe.

1085
01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:46.290
Which turned out to be a vault. Right.

1086
01:24:46.373 --> 01:24:47.958
Hmm.

1087
01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:49.793
Son of a bitch was so arrogant

1088
01:24:49.876 --> 01:24:52.337
he didn't know the difference
between a vault and a safe.

1089
01:24:57.884 --> 01:25:01.054
Wait a second. how did you know
Bruno was gonna double-cross us?

1090
01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.140
We needed a wildcard.

1091
01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.183
Someone to take the fall
if things went bad.

1092
01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.644
Yeah. and he played the role perfectly.

1093
01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:12.190
I mean. him going there alone was the best
smoke and mirrors we could have hoped for

1094
01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:14.234
to get these paintings here safely.

1095
01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:16.320
- Yeah.
- Yep.

1096
01:25:16.403 --> 01:25:17.571
Yep. yep. yep-

1097
01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.714
Josef. we did it.

1098
01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:56.401
Oh. Annabel. you've done well.

1099
01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.195
Josef would be proud.

1100
01:25:59.196 --> 01:26:02.449
The paintings you recovered
are-are priceless.

1101
01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:07.079
Our appraisers have valued them beyond
the levels of our... our current assets.

1102
01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.164
And with their donation to the museum.

1103
01:26:09.247 --> 01:26:12.793
we're able to shelter
our other taxable resources.

1104
01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:17.172
Our budget for future operations
has tripled.

1105
01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:22.427
And Josef was not the only one
the Nazis stole from.

1106
01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:25.138
There are others.

1107
01:26:25.222 --> 01:26:29.309
And like Josef.
they have done everything in their power

1108
01:26:29.393 --> 01:26:32.896
to preserve their ownership and right.

1109
01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:39.069
So we hope you are not considering
retirement just yet.

1110
01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:41.863
I wouldn't think of it.

1111
01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:42.989
I 'Chaim.

1112
01:26:43.073 --> 01:26:44.366
- L'Chaim.
- L'Chaim.

1113
01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:48.453
Alright. ladies. round two.

1114
01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:49.955
- Yes!
- Alright.

1115
01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:52.165
Woo-hoo!

1116
01:26:52.249 --> 01:26:55.252
- Oh. she ready? What?
- What?

1117
01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:57.713
I just. uh... I've been thinking. right?

1118
01:26:57.796 --> 01:26:59.047
I don't... I don't know.

1119
01:26:59.965 --> 01:27:02.718
Like. I get that we did
a good thing. right?

1120
01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:07.472
You know. that everybody gets to see
the paintings. the Nazis don't have them.

1121
01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:10.576
But why do we have to donate them?

1122
01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.018
- Oh. come on.
- I just... you know?

1123
01:27:12.102 --> 01:27:13.812
- We did a good deed.
- Yeah. yeah.

1124
01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.814
- Yeah.
- That should be reward enough.

1125
01:27:16.773 --> 01:27:19.192
Listen. Plus. it saves the syndicate
millions in taxes

1126
01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:21.278
when you donate the paintings.

1127
01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:25.031
That means we make more money
to steal more shit.

1128
01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:26.783
- Exactly.
- Mm-hmm.

1129
01:27:26.867 --> 01:27:29.911
Which. now that you mention it.
the syndicate has another Mark for us.

1130
01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:32.914
So. who's up for another challenge?

1131
01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:37.294
Huh? Huh?

1132
01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:38.962
You know you're my ride or die. Annie.

1133
01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:40.964
- Yes.
- Ooh.

1134
01:27:41.047 --> 01:27:42.191
- Yes.
- I mean. it beats the hell

1135
01:27:42.215 --> 01:27:45.469
out of spending another five to ten
with the feds. so I'm in.

1136
01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:48.805
Nadia?

1137
01:27:50.056 --> 01:27:53.518
- Hell. yeah.
- Hell. yeah!

1138
01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:55.562
- So glad for you.
- You two.

1139
01:27:55.645 --> 01:27:56.772
Are we good?

1140
01:27:56.855 --> 01:27:58.135
- You know...
- Come on. come on.

1141
01:27:58.190 --> 01:27:59.917
It still would have been cool
to be millionaires.

1142
01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:02.402
I'm just... I'm just saying. you know.

1143
01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:04.112
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
