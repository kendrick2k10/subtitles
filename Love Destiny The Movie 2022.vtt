00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:02.625
I'M WAITING AT YOUR HOUSE.

10
00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:05.833
JUST A SECOND.
I'M GETTING OFF FROM THE MRT.

11
00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:10.958
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE IN 10 MINUTES.
I'M LEAVING.

12
00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:15.750
HOLD ON. I'LL GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT
ON ANY PIECE YOU LIKE.

13
00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:45.291
Has this house been sold already?

14
00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:51.000
Yes.

15
00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:54.791
I didn't get a good price for it.

16
00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:57.041
But I don't know why I'd keep it.

17
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.375
But this one. Noon.

18
00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:03.958
It's the gun of Luang Awutwiset.

19
00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.375
My family heirloom.

20
00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:09.458
From Rama III era.

21
00:03:09.541 --> 00:03:12.875
He was the owner
of Thailand's first department store.

22
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:19.291
Here. Take a look at this.

23
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:28.458
Noon.

24
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:32.083
Do you see this wooden box in this photo?

25
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:33.375
It's the same one.

26
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.750
This is a picture of the grandparents
of my great-great-great grandma.

27
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.833
If you want it.
I'll throw in this picture too.

28
00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:46.875
They're your ancestors.

29
00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.125
Keep it to pay respects.

30
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.166
As for the gun…

31
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.791
LUANG AWUTWISET

32
00:03:56.916 --> 00:03:59.666
I'll give you 500.000.

33
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.541
Well. that sounds okay. but…

34
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.833
let me go talk with my mom first.

35
00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:16.666
She's really possessive of it.

36
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.666
Tell your mom I can go up to 600.000.

37
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.500
650.000 then.

38
00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.833
MRS. LEELAWADEE HUNTRAKUL

39
00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:31.916
Mom.

40
00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:37.041
I know the gun has a long history.

41
00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:42.000
But. he really is giving
a great price. Mom.

42
00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:44.250
It's enough to buy a car.

43
00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:48.000
But. if you're not okay.

44
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:50.083
then send me a signal.

45
00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:56.541
Whether it be a strong wind. thunder.
or make something fall.

46
00:05:04.666 --> 00:05:05.875
You're okay with it?

47
00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:08.333
Well…

48
00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:09.791
I'm going to sell it then.

49
00:05:56.875 --> 00:05:58.000
What?

50
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.375
What?

51
00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:53.958
What?

52
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.666
Come on.

53
00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:08.458
Why?

54
00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:50.666
What?

00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:06.541

The newsletter stated this.

66
00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:35.875
This means the Express

67
00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.000
is close to arriving to Siam.
am I right. sir?

68
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.583
Sir.

69
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.083
Sir.

70
00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:07.791
I just bought this from a Chinese merchant
at the market.

71
00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:09.791
Father Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix.

72
00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:12.541
Could you please pay attention
to what I'm saying. sir?

73
00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.625
Sure.

74
00:10:14.708 --> 00:10:17.500
Come take a look at this. Miss Gaysorn.

75
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:33.625
What language is this?

76
00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:35.500
It's not Khmer.

77
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.666
I'm not sure if it's Siamese.

78
00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:41.458
Take a look. Can you read it or not?

79
00:10:45.375 --> 00:10:47.208
They're Siamese characters. sir.

80
00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:49.000
But it's written in a strange manner.

81
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.583
"My name is Ketsurang."

82
00:10:57.666 --> 00:11:01.375
"I'm a fourth-year archeology student."

83
00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:04.541
"I'm a bit on the plus-size kind of girl."

84
00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:10.916
"And in the year of 2018 C.E..

85
00:11:11.541 --> 00:11:14.375
I traveled back in time…"

86
00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:18.875
"<i>I'm now in the body of Lady Karaket.</i>

87
00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:22.500
<i>the most beautiful…</i>

88
00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:25.541
just like Miss Grand…

89
00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:29.208
Ayutthaya!"

90
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.625
"Ayutthaya…"

91
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.791
Must mean the city Ayutthaya.

92
00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:38.416
But. "traveled back in time…"

93
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.875
What does this mean. sir?

94
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:50.333
"Darn. Freaking cool."

95
00:11:50.416 --> 00:11:54.500
"Dej got promoted

96
00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:58.666
to Khun Sriwisarnwaja."

97
00:12:06.166 --> 00:12:08.666
This journal is very interesting indeed.

98
00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:13.916
Will you please study it
and tell me about it later?

99
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:18.416
Yes. sir.

100
00:13:03.208 --> 00:13:04.166
Dej!

101
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.166
Karaket. my love.

102
00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:08.083
Are thou secretly writing about me?

103
00:13:09.166 --> 00:13:12.375
This is my personal journal.
You aren't allowed to read it.

104
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:15.125
No!

105
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.833
Bhop.

106
00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:10.250
Are you awake yet. son?

107
00:14:11.125 --> 00:14:12.083
Not yet. Mother.

108
00:14:13.083 --> 00:14:15.125
Then who is it that is answering me?

109
00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:20.333
I think it's time for you
to meet your fiancée.

110
00:14:20.416 --> 00:14:22.166
You've been stalling for years.

111
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.125
You have never seen her in person.

112
00:14:26.916 --> 00:14:28.083
Do you remember?

113
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.291
Your father had tied your lifeline
with Gaysorn's.

114
00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:37.958
If you both marry each other.
your lives will continue on.

115
00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:40.958
But if not…

116
00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:53.750
Either you or Gaysorn will die.

117
00:14:54.583 --> 00:14:55.875
The lifeline will be cut.

118
00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:03.291
If it is you who were to die.
then how could I continue to live?

119
00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:12.541
I intended to go meet
my betrothed today anyway.

120
00:15:23.916 --> 00:15:27.708

121

122
00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:41.250
Chief Sombatbordi.

123
00:15:41.958 --> 00:15:44.875
You should have sent word
that you were coming.

124
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.791
Today. Gaysorn isn't at home.

125
00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:53.500
She's gone to study at the church
since the early morning.

126
00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:58.916
It's a pity
that the two of you have not met yet.

127
00:16:01.916 --> 00:16:03.125
That's all right. sir.

128
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.750
I'm here to meet with you. actually.

129
00:16:09.541 --> 00:16:10.833
Four years ago.

130
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.333
my parents and you

131
00:16:14.416 --> 00:16:17.583
verbally betrothed Gaysorn and I
to each other.

132
00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:20.791
However. I was engaged with work.

133
00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:24.375
I had to build the main temple
at Prib Pri city.

134
00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:25.750
When I came back to the capital.

135
00:16:26.875 --> 00:16:29.583
I had to construct the pagoda
at Prayun Temple.

136
00:16:31.208 --> 00:16:36.916
Thus I never had the chance
to meet with Gaysorn.

137
00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:46.208
I…

138
00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:51.041
would like to ask to…

139
00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:01.291
break off our engagement.

140
00:18:03.791 --> 00:18:05.708
I don't find it amusing. Pi.

141
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:08.208
Next time I'll take you to see
something more amusing.

142
00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:10.250
What is it. miss?

143
00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:14.125
A steamboat from England.
It's made entirely of steel.

144
00:18:14.208 --> 00:18:15.291
but it floats in water.

145
00:18:15.875 --> 00:18:17.000
Miss.

146
00:18:17.083 --> 00:18:18.541
Any ship is the same.

147
00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:19.958
Let's watch the play.

148
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:24.666
This Prince's royal performing ensemble
is the best ensemble in the capital. miss.

149
00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:26.791
How can you like this?

150
00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:28.333
Phra Aphai Mani is ever the ladies' man.

151
00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:33.375
If I wrote the story.
I'd have the giantess eat him.

152
00:18:33.458 --> 00:18:35.500
Will you please be quiet?

153
00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:38.333
I can't understand what's going on.

154
00:18:40.666 --> 00:18:41.500
Who is it?

155
00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:46.208
Just some man.

156
00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:49.333
He's good-looking.
but his brows are knitted together.

157
00:18:49.416 --> 00:18:52.291
He seems to be a regular here. miss.

158
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:55.041
Tell him to cover his ears.

159
00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:00.666
Cover your ears. sir.

160
00:19:02.666 --> 00:19:05.666
Tell the person next to you
to cover her mouth.

161
00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:07.291
How rude.

162
00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:09.458
People are watching the show.

163
00:20:02.583 --> 00:20:03.750
Let's go home. Pi.

164
00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:05.416
I've got chills.

165
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.541
Yes. miss.

166
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:22.666
What is thy name?

167
00:20:23.541 --> 00:20:25.791
Who are thy parents?
Where is thy residence?

168
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:29.166
Why are you using the word "thy"?

169
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.541
You sound so ancient.

170
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:33.375
Then by what name shall I call thee?

171
00:20:34.625 --> 00:20:36.333
I haven't learned thy name yet.

172
00:20:40.166 --> 00:20:42.541
My name is Viola.
My sister's name is Fiddle.

173
00:20:44.125 --> 00:20:45.666
Our mother's name is Violin.

174
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.708
Our father's name is Cello.
We're a string ensemble.

175
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.041
You two are good at fiddling around.

176
00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:57.791
And for what reason is thy sister
dressed as a helper?

177
00:21:03.375 --> 00:21:05.041
My sister likes to disguise herself.

178
00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:07.375
That's right.

179
00:21:07.458 --> 00:21:09.250
Or else we won't be able
to leave the house.

180
00:21:09.333 --> 00:21:13.875
Men are waiting to kidnap me
as I am quite the beauty.

181
00:21:15.666 --> 00:21:19.458
Then thou must not have disguised thyself.

182
00:21:21.125 --> 00:21:25.500
Seeing as thou art as beautiful
as the sunset.

183
00:21:27.833 --> 00:21:29.333
Let me tell you something
for your own good.

184
00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:32.500
My lady is already betrothed.

185
00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:34.125
He's a Chief-ranking official.

186
00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:37.333
Is he Mis-Chief or Handker-Chief?

187
00:21:38.041 --> 00:21:39.583
Chief Sombatbordi.

188
00:21:42.708 --> 00:21:43.833
Thou art Gaysorn?

189
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.833
The daughter of the Police Colonel?

190
00:21:51.083 --> 00:21:52.375
How do you know?

191
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:56.250
I am…

192
00:21:58.208 --> 00:21:59.708
Chief Sombatbordi.

193
00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:05.750
You're my fiancé?

194
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.666
Yes.

195
00:22:08.583 --> 00:22:11.583
This morning I just went to thy house.

196
00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:13.791
Did you arrange
for the wedding day already?

197
00:22:16.125 --> 00:22:17.458
I went to…

198
00:22:18.708 --> 00:22:20.416
…break off our engagement.

199
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.083
How could you say such a thing?

200
00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:26.583
If you do not wed

201
00:22:27.291 --> 00:22:32.125
and if Gaysorn's lifeline is cut off.

202
00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:34.708
who will be responsible?

203
00:22:38.708 --> 00:22:41.041
I will not allow you
to break off the engagement.

204
00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:46.458
I will not allow it. no matter what!

205
00:22:46.541 --> 00:22:47.875
But I want to.

206
00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:50.875
At first. I also wanted to.

207
00:22:51.416 --> 00:22:52.250
<i>But…</i>

208
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.791
…I have my eye on someone else. sir.

209
00:22:57.416 --> 00:22:58.750
Even if I must die.

210
00:22:59.875 --> 00:23:03.541
I really am not able to wed Gaysorn.

211
00:23:03.625 --> 00:23:05.000
I despise men

212
00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:06.583
who do not keep their promises.

213
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:10.958
You must be hiding mistresses away
in the other cities.

214
00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:16.125
It's good that my daughter
will not have you as her husband!

215
00:23:16.875 --> 00:23:18.291
Madam.

216
00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:20.416
You say such things about my son…

217
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.333
And what about your daughter?

218
00:23:23.375 --> 00:23:24.666
What woman

219
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.791
dresses up and styles her hair
in such a peculiar way?

220
00:23:27.875 --> 00:23:30.958
Why does she not wear her hair
like the other women?

221
00:23:31.041 --> 00:23:33.875
All she does is study foreign subjects.

222
00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:36.541
Such a peculiar woman as her
is not wife material.

223
00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:38.750
That's why you tied her fortune
with my son!

224
00:23:38.833 --> 00:23:41.833
Then you best mind the life of your son.

225
00:23:41.916 --> 00:23:44.041
Who knows when his time will come?

226
00:23:44.125 --> 00:23:46.166
It's your daughter who must be careful.

227
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.708
I'll be waiting to see whose child
will be the first to go!

228
00:23:48.791 --> 00:23:50.708
Hey! Just tell me if the engagement
is broken off or not?

229
00:23:56.625 --> 00:23:57.666
That's enough.

230
00:23:58.291 --> 00:24:02.458
If you want to break off the engagement.
then do so.

231
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.625
Don't you ever show your face
around here again.

232
00:24:08.708 --> 00:24:12.708
Don't even dare to row your boat
past my pier!

233
00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:24.708
Please tell me that thou art Viola.

234
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.000
The daughter of Cello.

235
00:24:28.541 --> 00:24:30.750
You've been building temples
for many years.

236
00:24:30.833 --> 00:24:32.541
yet you don't have enough blessings.

237
00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:00.583
Oh. destiny…

238
00:25:02.208 --> 00:25:04.708
Why are you so mean to me?

239
00:25:06.083 --> 00:25:09.541
My destiny must be like Usaren.

240
00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:12.541
whom Pra Aphai Mani stole his fiancé
away from him.

241
00:25:12.625 --> 00:25:13.500
It's not the same.

242
00:25:13.583 --> 00:25:14.416
How so?

243
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:19.416
Usaren had his fiancé taken from him.
but you're just a plain fool.

244
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.583
You broke up with her first.

245
00:25:23.833 --> 00:25:25.750
Uncle Phu. you wrote this story.

246
00:25:26.458 --> 00:25:28.708
Then you can change the ending.

247
00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:32.333
Make Usaren reunite with Suwanmali.

248
00:25:34.583 --> 00:25:35.958
Rewrite it now.

249
00:25:36.041 --> 00:25:39.791
So the dancers can rehearse the new dance.

250
00:25:41.083 --> 00:25:45.125
If I changed it.
people would burn down my house.

251
00:25:45.208 --> 00:25:47.875
This is Phra Aphai Mani's story.

252
00:25:48.958 --> 00:25:52.500
The protagonist has to win it all.

253
00:25:57.541 --> 00:25:58.916
What now?

254
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:01.000
Uncle. you just went treasure hunting.

255
00:26:03.083 --> 00:26:04.875
Did you get any magical items

256
00:26:04.958 --> 00:26:08.000
that can help me
get re-engaged to Gaysorn?

257
00:26:09.375 --> 00:26:10.791
Well…

258
00:26:10.875 --> 00:26:12.708
You know everything.

259
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.458
Take your pick then.

260
00:26:16.541 --> 00:26:21.375
Every piece is sacred and magical.

261
00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:27.416
No. This one you can't have.

262
00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:28.958
It's off limits.

263
00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:32.041
This is the Krishna-Kali scripture.

264
00:26:32.666 --> 00:26:35.125
According to ancient records.

265
00:26:35.208 --> 00:26:40.708
it's used to put curses on people
who think and does evil.

266
00:26:40.791 --> 00:26:44.583
If they are cursed using these chants.
they will die.

267
00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:47.500
Uncle Phu.

268
00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:54.666
Is there any magical item
that will turn back time?

269
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:59.041
I want to go back to four years ago.

270
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.000
And I would not go anywhere else.

271
00:27:03.458 --> 00:27:06.083
I would rush to see Gaysorn quickly.

272
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:09.791
All right.

273
00:27:10.458 --> 00:27:12.083
There's only one way.

274
00:27:13.166 --> 00:27:14.458
You need to use this.

275
00:27:19.958 --> 00:27:21.041
My nipple?

276
00:27:21.125 --> 00:27:22.458
Your heart!

277
00:27:22.541 --> 00:27:23.791
Goodness.

278
00:27:35.833 --> 00:27:36.666
Be careful. miss.

279
00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:47.916
Chuen. row as fast as you can.

280
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.916
Yes. miss.

281
00:28:20.958 --> 00:28:22.541
You can go home first.

282
00:28:22.625 --> 00:28:23.458
Yes. sir.

283
00:28:23.541 --> 00:28:25.208
I'm going to the church.

284
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:26.208
Pi.

285
00:28:26.291 --> 00:28:28.666
What shall I do to not see
this smiling face again?

286
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.291
He hovers around just like a fly.

287
00:28:32.291 --> 00:28:33.208
Miss.

288
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.416
Let's do this.

289
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.208
We have to make the Chief see
that you are a wicked person.

290
00:28:40.875 --> 00:28:43.833
Self-centered. unpredictable.
fussy. and bossy.

291
00:28:43.916 --> 00:28:44.791
Wait.

292
00:28:45.333 --> 00:28:47.416
Is this a plan or your inner thoughts?

293
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.416
Oh. miss. the Chief is looking at us.

294
00:28:53.958 --> 00:28:55.833
You have to slap me. miss.

295
00:28:55.916 --> 00:28:59.083
Let him see that you slap your help
for no reason.

296
00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:00.750
What?

297
00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:03.250
Quickly. Just slap me.

298
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.208
I can't do that.

299
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:06.583
I love you just like a sister.

300
00:29:06.666 --> 00:29:09.666
Miss! Slap me.

301
00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:12.208
You want that Smiley as your…

302
00:29:18.333 --> 00:29:19.500
Pi.

303
00:29:20.208 --> 00:29:21.791
He didn't see it.

304
00:29:21.875 --> 00:29:22.791
Slap me again.

305
00:29:23.833 --> 00:29:25.416
I think we should change the method.

306
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.875
Slap now!

307
00:29:31.083 --> 00:29:33.000
Miss. slapping isn't enough.

308
00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:36.708
You have to scold me really badly
and very loudly for the Chief to hear.

309
00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:38.791
I can't. I think it's enough.

310
00:29:38.875 --> 00:29:41.291
If it's going to be this tough.
it'd be better to just be honest with him.

311
00:29:41.375 --> 00:29:42.875
Just scold me!

312
00:29:42.958 --> 00:29:44.416
Spew out any curses.

313
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.083
The Chief must hate and fear you.

314
00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:47.208
I can't do it!

315
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:48.833
You have to!

316
00:29:48.916 --> 00:29:49.875
You must…

317
00:29:49.958 --> 00:29:51.166
Pi. you!

318
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:55.541
-Chief. He is watching…
-Chucklehead!

319
00:29:56.958 --> 00:29:58.041
Ratbag!

320
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:01.416
You wench!

321
00:30:07.625 --> 00:30:08.458
Pi.

322
00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:11.333
Did the Chief see it?

323
00:30:12.708 --> 00:30:15.375
I think he did. miss.

324
00:30:21.625 --> 00:30:22.916
Dost thou study here?

325
00:30:28.666 --> 00:30:29.541
You fool!

326
00:30:29.625 --> 00:30:31.208
Take this artifact away.

327
00:30:31.291 --> 00:30:32.708
I'm going to go study!

328
00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:35.291
Buffoon!

329
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.416
Do you want to change sides?

330
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.708
The same side is better.

331
00:30:38.791 --> 00:30:40.708
Leave the other one
for me to chew. please.

332
00:30:42.083 --> 00:30:44.875
-You!
-I know thou art pretending.

333
00:30:54.291 --> 00:30:55.125
Sir.

334
00:30:55.208 --> 00:30:57.416
Where is the chest
that keeps the Lady's journal?

335
00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.625
I'm going to continue studying.

336
00:31:03.833 --> 00:31:07.416
This man is your destiny. Am I right?

337
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:11.125
The fiancé you wish to never meet.

338
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.750
What?

339
00:31:18.625 --> 00:31:20.958
Dej-ti-ny?

340
00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:23.583
Sir.

341
00:31:24.166 --> 00:31:25.208
The chest. please.

342
00:31:31.375 --> 00:31:34.666
I heard that you have built many temples.

343
00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.750
Oh. yes. sir.

344
00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:37.166
Sir.

345
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.041
May I have the key to the chest. please?

346
00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:41.958
Key?

347
00:31:43.166 --> 00:31:44.916
Oh. the key.

348
00:31:46.125 --> 00:31:48.000
I guess I forgot it in my room.

349
00:31:48.083 --> 00:31:50.541
I better go get it.

350
00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:01.291
Art thou mad
that I broke off our engagement?

351
00:32:03.583 --> 00:32:05.291
Stop calling me thou.

352
00:32:05.375 --> 00:32:07.541
Who uses that word anymore? So strange.

353
00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:10.833
Oh. if thou dost not want me
to call thee thou.

354
00:32:10.916 --> 00:32:13.125
what dost thou want me to call thee then?

355
00:32:18.125 --> 00:32:19.708
Dost thou know?

356
00:32:20.583 --> 00:32:22.541
I have dreamed of thee for so many years.

357
00:32:23.208 --> 00:32:25.458
We are absolutely destined to be together.

358
00:32:26.583 --> 00:32:29.208
Had I known
that thou were betrothed to me.

359
00:32:29.291 --> 00:32:31.875
I would not have ever
broken off the engagement.

360
00:32:35.375 --> 00:32:36.541
Dost thou loathe me

361
00:32:36.625 --> 00:32:39.166
to the point thou
will not turn to look at me?

362
00:32:43.375 --> 00:32:44.875
I'm not mad that you
broke off the engagement

363
00:32:44.958 --> 00:32:46.458
because I never wanted
to be engaged to you.

364
00:32:46.541 --> 00:32:50.333
I used our engagement as an excuse
to continue my studies here.

365
00:32:50.416 --> 00:32:52.833
Pallegoix has been kind enough
to teach me.

366
00:32:52.916 --> 00:32:54.666
I hadn't planned to study for long.

367
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.916
But now I can speak English well.

368
00:33:02.166 --> 00:33:04.375
Four years! Where have you been?

369
00:33:04.958 --> 00:33:07.750
Is it that you're plain rude
or do you disdain me?

370
00:33:07.833 --> 00:33:09.375
Which is why you never came to meet me?

371
00:33:10.083 --> 00:33:11.958
Oh. no. I apologize.

372
00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:14.125
I'm sorry for letting thee wait so long.

373
00:33:16.208 --> 00:33:18.625
May I ask for us to be engaged once more?

374
00:33:21.791 --> 00:33:24.750
Do you believe
we are destined to be together?

375
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:30.041
If so. could you wait?

376
00:33:30.125 --> 00:33:31.166
Of course.

377
00:33:31.666 --> 00:33:33.125
No matter how long. I will wait.

378
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:37.208
Wait until our next life then.

379
00:34:21.208 --> 00:34:22.250
THE BRITISH FACTORY

380
00:34:22.333 --> 00:34:24.666
ROYAL TREASURY PIER

381
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.208
Miss.

382
00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:27.625
Take it easy.

383
00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:30.333
If you fall into the water.
it'll be a big mess.

384
00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.041
Pi. hurry.

385
00:34:59.833 --> 00:35:03.708
Rumor has it that angels built it.
so this iron ship can float in water.

386
00:35:04.875 --> 00:35:07.125
A monk's alms bowl
can also float in water.

387
00:35:07.208 --> 00:35:08.625
You're so gullible.

388
00:35:39.458 --> 00:35:42.833
The ship is enormous.
just as rumored. Mr. Hunter.

389
00:35:47.666 --> 00:35:49.000
The bill of sale.

390
00:35:59.375 --> 00:36:03.041
Wasn't the price you gave at first
at 50.000 dollars?

391
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.791
Why has the price increased to 67.000?

392
00:36:08.875 --> 00:36:11.291
The ship was stranded
in a storm in Singapore.

393
00:36:11.375 --> 00:36:13.333
Minister of the Royal Treasury.

394
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.833
Therefore. it had to use more coal.

395
00:36:17.666 --> 00:36:20.041
I didn't raise the price
without any reason.

396
00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:25.833
Siam ordered this steamboat
to wage war with Cochinchina.

397
00:36:26.666 --> 00:36:29.208
But now the war is nearing an end.

398
00:36:29.291 --> 00:36:31.125
This iron ship of yours is…

399
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.083
beautiful…

400
00:36:39.375 --> 00:36:40.500
Absolutely beautiful.

401
00:36:43.125 --> 00:36:44.375
Chief Sombatbordi.

402
00:36:45.458 --> 00:36:47.583
Go wash your face to sober up.

403
00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:50.291
And quickly inspect the steamboat now.

404
00:36:50.375 --> 00:36:51.250
Yes. sir.

405
00:36:51.333 --> 00:36:52.416
Mr. Hunter.

406
00:36:52.958 --> 00:36:53.916
Let's go talk inside.

407
00:38:10.708 --> 00:38:11.708
Miss!

408
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.500
Are you all right?

409
00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:16.125
Are you hurt?

410
00:38:16.708 --> 00:38:18.791
My goodness. How did this happen?

411
00:38:18.875 --> 00:38:20.583
Be careful. Come. miss.

412
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:25.708
Are you all right?

413
00:38:27.291 --> 00:38:28.208
I'm not hurt…

414
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:29.291
Hey!

415
00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:32.500
Are you in pain?

416
00:38:35.458 --> 00:38:36.583
No.

417
00:38:36.666 --> 00:38:40.125
But I'm afraid of blood.

418
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:44.000
What to do?

419
00:38:47.166 --> 00:38:48.583
Let me do it. miss.

420
00:38:53.333 --> 00:38:54.500
Here.

421
00:38:56.791 --> 00:38:58.791
Darn. Freakin' cool.

422
00:39:01.583 --> 00:39:02.750
DARN. FREAKIN' COOL.

423
00:39:09.958 --> 00:39:11.041
Here.

424
00:39:11.125 --> 00:39:12.166
Let me help you.

425
00:39:13.041 --> 00:39:14.333
Oh. dear.

426
00:39:14.416 --> 00:39:16.458
You are all sweaty
as if you lost your hand.

427
00:39:22.666 --> 00:39:24.416
Let's get up. miss.

428
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.208
Let's go. You got all dirty.

429
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.333
Are you all right?

430
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:51.416
Is this yours?

431
00:39:52.125 --> 00:39:53.666
Oh. yes.

432
00:39:54.583 --> 00:39:55.708
Thank you for picking it up for me.

433
00:39:55.791 --> 00:39:57.000
Who are you?

434
00:39:58.208 --> 00:40:00.041
Why did you bring a pistol here?

435
00:40:17.041 --> 00:40:18.000
Chief.

436
00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:20.541
You're not the police.

437
00:40:20.625 --> 00:40:22.333
You don't have the authority
to arrest anyone.

438
00:40:23.916 --> 00:40:25.333
Let him go right now.

439
00:40:26.083 --> 00:40:28.708
But this is the Royal Treasury's area.

440
00:40:28.791 --> 00:40:32.333
I have the authority to interrogate
strangers who bring in a weapon.

441
00:40:37.208 --> 00:40:38.666
What is your relation to Gaysorn?

442
00:40:39.625 --> 00:40:42.333
Why were you smiling so sweetly
at each other?

443
00:40:42.416 --> 00:40:43.791
Chief!

444
00:40:44.458 --> 00:40:46.791
You're not my fiancé anymore.
Don't act like this.

445
00:40:48.666 --> 00:40:50.625
If you're going to interrogate him.
do it now.

446
00:40:55.791 --> 00:40:57.916
"Luang Awutwiset."

447
00:41:01.166 --> 00:41:03.291
That's the title given to Mr. Hunter.

448
00:41:03.375 --> 00:41:04.833
This pistol isn't yours.

449
00:41:07.708 --> 00:41:09.041
My name is Mathus.

450
00:41:09.958 --> 00:41:12.291
I've been working at
Hunter's British Factory for three years.

451
00:41:12.375 --> 00:41:13.958
Don't you lie to me.

452
00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:18.333
Someone with your looks.
could work with Westerners?

453
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.208
What did he say?

454
00:41:37.875 --> 00:41:39.583
He's Hunter's assistant.

455
00:41:39.666 --> 00:41:40.583
He's good at what he does.

456
00:41:40.666 --> 00:41:42.375
Hunter gave him the gun as a present.

457
00:41:47.791 --> 00:41:49.500
This is a royal gift bestowed by the King.

458
00:41:50.083 --> 00:41:52.791
There's no way Hunter would give it away.

459
00:41:54.583 --> 00:41:56.000
You stole it. didn't you?

460
00:41:56.916 --> 00:41:57.833
What?

461
00:42:00.458 --> 00:42:01.750
Chief!

462
00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:07.791
What is this?

463
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:10.291
Did you smuggle it over the border?

464
00:42:11.208 --> 00:42:12.791
These are called sunglasses.

465
00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:19.000
Hard material as such must be a weapon

466
00:42:19.083 --> 00:42:20.791
for throwing at people. correct?

467
00:42:20.875 --> 00:42:21.875
No.

468
00:42:21.958 --> 00:42:22.833
It's not a weapon.

469
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:25.333
It's a mobile phone.

470
00:42:30.041 --> 00:42:31.916
"Mobile phone"?

471
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
I'm not a thief.

472
00:42:39.458 --> 00:42:42.583
It's my duty to inspect
the steamboat today.

473
00:42:49.083 --> 00:42:50.958
All right. I will let you go.

474
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:56.125
But I will keep all of these things
to ask Mr. Hunter about them first.

475
00:42:58.875 --> 00:43:00.291
But the pistol is broken…

476
00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:05.166
Do you want to leave
or go to prison with this pistol of yours?

477
00:43:13.875 --> 00:43:14.708
Go.

478
00:43:25.458 --> 00:43:26.291
Move.

479
00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:27.291
Go.

480
00:43:57.625 --> 00:43:58.791
Hello. Ma'am.

481
00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:04.375
Wow!

482
00:44:04.458 --> 00:44:08.250
It smells so nice and looks so good.

483
00:44:08.333 --> 00:44:10.875
What curry did you cook?

484
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.666
"Wary" curry.

485
00:44:16.041 --> 00:44:18.083
Beef "wary" curry.

486
00:44:26.375 --> 00:44:28.833
Mother asked me to come and apologize

487
00:44:28.916 --> 00:44:32.208
to you for saying things
she shouldn't have.

488
00:44:41.375 --> 00:44:43.000
I also have something that's hard to find.

489
00:44:43.083 --> 00:44:45.500
It's grape juice from abroad. ma'am.

490
00:45:04.916 --> 00:45:07.291
It strangely burns my throat.

491
00:45:07.375 --> 00:45:09.875
Are you sure this is grape juice?

492
00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:12.916
Ma'am.

493
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.916
But it has medicinal benefits.

494
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.708
Ever since Mother drank this grape juice.

495
00:45:20.333 --> 00:45:24.541
when the night falls.
Father has not gotten any sleep.

496
00:46:01.416 --> 00:46:04.083
Can I have another glass?

497
00:46:05.625 --> 00:46:06.458
Sure. ma'am.

498
00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.875
Refreshing.

499
00:46:27.875 --> 00:46:29.250
Ma'am.

500
00:46:29.333 --> 00:46:30.541
I won't have any.

501
00:46:30.625 --> 00:46:32.416
Just a little.

502
00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:34.791
To boost your blood circulation

503
00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:37.791
and have the strength
to rock the boat all night long.

504
00:46:52.125 --> 00:46:53.041
What?

505
00:47:22.333 --> 00:47:24.708
Have you come back already?

506
00:47:24.791 --> 00:47:28.416
Bhop. my dear son.

507
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:36.166
Bhop. my dear master-to-be.

508
00:47:41.833 --> 00:47:42.875
Where is your lady?

509
00:47:57.916 --> 00:47:58.791
Yes!

510
00:48:00.541 --> 00:48:01.458
I've been looking for you!

511
00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:03.583
What art thou looking for?

512
00:48:03.666 --> 00:48:05.166
The pistol. of course.

513
00:48:24.666 --> 00:48:26.833
Don't stare at me. I won't be swayed.

514
00:48:28.083 --> 00:48:29.041
Move back.

515
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.583
Shoot me.

516
00:48:32.208 --> 00:48:35.916
So I can die
and I will wait for thee in the next life.

517
00:48:37.625 --> 00:48:40.083
I'm the Police Colonel's daughter.
Don't think I won't dare.

518
00:48:41.541 --> 00:48:43.208
I know that thou dare to.

519
00:48:43.291 --> 00:48:46.583
But. it doesn't have any bullets.

520
00:48:49.083 --> 00:48:50.125
That's my pistol.

521
00:48:51.875 --> 00:48:54.250
CHIEF SOMBATBORDI

522
00:49:03.375 --> 00:49:08.541
That person with the strange name
told thee to steal the pistol back?

523
00:49:09.708 --> 00:49:10.541
Thou art quiet.

524
00:49:11.125 --> 00:49:12.291
This means thou admit.

525
00:49:13.375 --> 00:49:17.083
I will tell the police to arrest

526
00:49:17.166 --> 00:49:18.625
that guy with the strange name.

527
00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:20.041
His name…

528
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:27.750
I want the pistol you took from the man
whose name is Mathus…

529
00:49:28.416 --> 00:49:29.500
Mathus!

530
00:49:31.041 --> 00:49:32.791
To trade with something.

531
00:49:48.208 --> 00:49:49.666
Just tell us the truth.

532
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.500
And he will return everything to you.

533
00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:08.708
I saw the word "mobile phone"
in Lady Karaket's journal.

534
00:50:08.791 --> 00:50:11.291
which was written in King Narai's time.

535
00:50:21.541 --> 00:50:22.666
"Let me complain a bit."

536
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.625
"I really miss Mom and Grandma."

537
00:50:24.708 --> 00:50:27.000
"It'd be great
if I had my mobile phone here."

538
00:50:28.583 --> 00:50:33.458
Lady Karaket called this journal
<i>Records of Ket's Krungsri</i>.

539
00:50:33.541 --> 00:50:35.791
She wrote the records
for the next generation

540
00:50:35.875 --> 00:50:38.625
to know what will happen to our country.

541
00:50:39.416 --> 00:50:42.125
Did she write what year she came from?

542
00:50:43.208 --> 00:50:48.791
2018 C.E.

543
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:56.000
I'm from 2021.

544
00:50:57.625 --> 00:51:00.125
which is 177 years from now.

545
00:51:07.791 --> 00:51:09.708
<i>This pistol took me back in time here.</i>

546
00:51:10.416 --> 00:51:12.291
<i>I was surprised and flipped out.</i>

547
00:51:12.375 --> 00:51:15.541
<i>I asked locals where the MRT was.</i>

548
00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:18.875
<i>They must have thought I was a foreigner.</i>

549
00:51:18.958 --> 00:51:21.291
<i>so they took me
to Hunter's British Factory.</i>

550
00:51:26.916 --> 00:51:27.750
<i>When Lady Sap.</i>

551
00:51:28.458 --> 00:51:32.458
<i>Mr. Hunter's wife
found out I could speak English.</i>

552
00:51:32.541 --> 00:51:35.000
<i>she put me to work at the store.</i>

553
00:51:35.791 --> 00:51:37.666
<i>I usually sold things online in my time.</i>

554
00:51:38.166 --> 00:51:40.083
<i>Oh. in simple words.</i>

555
00:51:40.166 --> 00:51:42.750
<i>I was kind of a merchant.
so it's not hard for me.</i>

556
00:51:43.541 --> 00:51:46.208
<i>Shortly. Mr. Hunter entrusted me…</i>

557
00:51:47.041 --> 00:51:48.916
to become his right-hand man.

558
00:51:50.375 --> 00:51:51.208
What?

559
00:51:52.625 --> 00:51:54.708
Oh. I mean…

560
00:51:55.958 --> 00:51:59.375
I was promoted to his assistant.
overseeing the sales for him sometimes.

561
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.333
I then realized

562
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.125
that I came back
to the time of my ancestors.

563
00:52:07.541 --> 00:52:09.791
My family name is Huntrakul.

564
00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:10.708
Well…

565
00:52:11.333 --> 00:52:13.208
it's likely to originate from Hunter.

566
00:52:13.291 --> 00:52:14.500
Family name?

567
00:52:15.333 --> 00:52:17.625
Is it like Westerners' surname?

568
00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:22.041
Let's say you married me.

569
00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:26.208
Your full name would be Gaysorn Huntrakul.

570
00:52:26.291 --> 00:52:27.375
Hey!

571
00:52:27.458 --> 00:52:29.083
You can't say such things.

572
00:52:29.875 --> 00:52:31.000
It's not proper.

573
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:33.833
All right then.

574
00:52:35.166 --> 00:52:36.875
Let's say you were my son.

575
00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:38.916
Your name would be

576
00:52:39.833 --> 00:52:41.333
Bhop Huntrakul.

577
00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:42.958
Gosh!

578
00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:44.708
There's no way I will ever be your child.

579
00:52:46.208 --> 00:52:47.041
So?

580
00:52:47.625 --> 00:52:50.166
Why are you wasting your time
smelling the flowers here?

581
00:52:50.916 --> 00:52:53.125
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

582
00:52:53.708 --> 00:52:55.500
I've tried doing so.

583
00:53:03.625 --> 00:53:04.875
<i>For the past three years.</i>

584
00:53:04.958 --> 00:53:07.500
<i>I haven't told anyone
about traveling back in time.</i>

585
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:13.000
<i>I fired the pistol at Prayun Temple
so many times…</i>

586
00:53:18.166 --> 00:53:19.250
<i> without any success.</i>

587
00:53:23.541 --> 00:53:25.916
<i>Because there's one thing
that isn't the same.</i>

588
00:53:30.166 --> 00:53:31.458
<i>The solar eclipse.</i>

589
00:53:33.708 --> 00:53:35.541
Rahu swallowing the sun?

590
00:53:35.625 --> 00:53:37.833
Oh. yes.

591
00:53:37.916 --> 00:53:39.291
Rahu swallowing the sun.

592
00:53:40.041 --> 00:53:40.875
But…

593
00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:46.250
I don't know when Rahu
will swallow the sun again.

594
00:53:47.375 --> 00:53:49.166
So I carry the pistol
around with me everyday.

595
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.583
If there was Google. it'd be great.

596
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:56.291
Goo…

597
00:53:57.041 --> 00:53:57.875
What?

598
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:05.750
It's a guru of everything.

599
00:54:06.625 --> 00:54:07.791
It will answer all your questions.

600
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:12.208
I know someone
who has answers to everything.

601
00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:22.625
Another two…

602
00:54:23.208 --> 00:54:24.416
Two days?

603
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.625
Two months.

604
00:54:26.583 --> 00:54:30.333
Another two months.
Rahu will swallow the sun.

605
00:54:30.416 --> 00:54:31.583
What?

606
00:54:40.208 --> 00:54:46.791
Oh. but Rahu will swallow the sun
just for a short moment.

607
00:54:47.958 --> 00:54:49.791
If you miss this chance.

608
00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:52.833
I can't tell you
when there will be another one.

609
00:54:57.333 --> 00:54:58.291
I have an idea.

610
00:54:59.083 --> 00:55:01.000
Before Mathus returns home.

611
00:55:01.083 --> 00:55:02.083
sir.

612
00:55:02.166 --> 00:55:04.250
may I have permission
to let Mathus read it?

613
00:55:04.333 --> 00:55:06.416
Mathus can read the words
in this journal fluently.

614
00:55:11.416 --> 00:55:13.791
"Now we're in Rama III era."

615
00:55:13.875 --> 00:55:17.666
"It's the golden age of foreign trade."

616
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:20.541
"Especially trade with the Chinese."

617
00:55:21.125 --> 00:55:24.666
"Lots of money was earned
by the Royal Treasury."

618
00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:26.041
"This is called the Red Purse Money."

619
00:55:27.458 --> 00:55:28.416
This is very interesting.

620
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:29.666
Let me take a look.

621
00:55:30.458 --> 00:55:31.833
Oh. okay.

622
00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:36.916
Oh. a girl with glasses.

623
00:55:38.916 --> 00:55:40.125
So beautiful.

624
00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:48.666
Lady Karaket also has records
of Mr. Hunter.

625
00:55:49.625 --> 00:55:51.166
Father Pallegoix is also in it.

626
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.208
"Pallegoix

627
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.458
who wrote the four-language dictionary…"

628
00:56:01.208 --> 00:56:03.333
I don’t want to know about myself.

629
00:56:03.416 --> 00:56:04.583
Oh. wait.

630
00:56:06.208 --> 00:56:08.833
And I also think that you all

631
00:56:10.916 --> 00:56:14.541
should not know about things
that haven't happened yet.

632
00:56:14.625 --> 00:56:17.250
But Lady Karaket wanted us to know. sir.

633
00:56:17.333 --> 00:56:19.041
She wrote the records for us.

634
00:56:20.416 --> 00:56:21.500
Miss Gaysorn.

635
00:56:23.041 --> 00:56:24.708
Return the key to me.

636
00:56:34.083 --> 00:56:38.375
If you don't listen to me.
don't come to study with me anymore.

637
00:56:51.375 --> 00:56:54.291
I prohibit you all
from studying this journal.

638
00:56:56.333 --> 00:56:58.458
Miss Gaysorn. keep it in the cabinet.

639
00:57:04.625 --> 00:57:09.166
Even if it's a bad event.
if it's God's will.

640
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.375
we have to let it happen.

641
00:57:14.375 --> 00:57:16.833
THE PRINCE'S PALACE

642
00:57:24.125 --> 00:57:25.166
No matter what.

643
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.458
I think we should buy the ship
from Mr. Hunter.

644
00:57:28.208 --> 00:57:33.291
Who knows when the colonial troops
of the Westerners will arrive at Siam?

645
00:57:33.375 --> 00:57:36.875
A number of their spies
are secretly disguised among us already.

646
00:57:36.958 --> 00:57:41.833
Our naval fleet should have the ship
and the newest weaponry

647
00:57:41.916 --> 00:57:43.125
to defend ourselves.

648
00:57:44.166 --> 00:57:46.541
I must ask a favor from you.
Phra Surasawad.

649
00:57:46.625 --> 00:57:49.750
the Royal Advisor to the Prince
whom he highly trusts.

650
00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:52.375
to please advise the Prince

651
00:57:52.458 --> 00:57:56.250
to see the advantages
of purchasing this ship.

652
00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:01.458
I won't buy it.

653
00:58:06.166 --> 00:58:09.791
When the Advisor and Minister of Treasury
proposed me to buy this ship.

654
00:58:12.583 --> 00:58:14.958
I've doubted how an iron steamboat

655
00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:17.291
can really float on water
and move on its own.

656
00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:23.625
And your ship arriving so late… Who knows?

657
00:58:23.708 --> 00:58:28.333
You might have modified junk
and towed it from England to Siam.

658
00:58:29.333 --> 00:58:33.458
And now.
you have the nerve to raise the price.

659
00:58:35.458 --> 00:58:38.625
I won't buy it…

660
00:58:46.041 --> 00:58:48.291
Now the ship has arrived.

661
00:58:48.875 --> 00:58:53.458
If you don't believe
the steamboat really can move on its own.

662
00:58:53.541 --> 00:58:54.666
all you have to do

663
00:58:55.791 --> 00:58:58.416
is go out and take a look for yourself!

664
00:59:11.208 --> 00:59:12.500
I don't believe you.

665
00:59:14.458 --> 00:59:16.083
And I'm not going out there to look.

666
00:59:17.375 --> 00:59:18.375
And I…

667
00:59:23.625 --> 00:59:25.125
won't buy your ship.

668
00:59:29.250 --> 00:59:31.000
Let go of him. Khun.

669
00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:39.958
You are fraudsters.

670
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:42.041
The Siamese are cheats.

671
00:59:42.583 --> 00:59:43.958
They don't keep their promises.

672
00:59:45.375 --> 00:59:48.666
I'm going to tell the British navy
to bring warships

673
00:59:49.375 --> 00:59:51.583
to close off the Gulf of Siam.

674
01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:03.875
Whoa!

675
01:00:03.958 --> 01:00:06.000
Hold on. Mr. Hunter.

676
01:00:06.625 --> 01:00:08.166
Get dressed properly first.

677
01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:16.541
I have a solution
to dispel any doubts about

678
01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:22.208
whether a ship made of steel
will float and move on its own or not.

679
01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:30.500
I would like to ask for your permission
to board the ship

680
01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:35.125
to study the design and structure
of the ship in detail

681
01:00:35.958 --> 01:00:37.625
so that I can make a functioning miniature

682
01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:42.291
and use it to prove to the Prince
where he can see it for himself.

683
01:00:42.375 --> 01:00:46.375
Chief Sombatbordi is the best craftsman
of the Royal Treasury.

684
01:00:47.083 --> 01:00:50.541
He has the expertise in mechanical engines
and chemistry.

685
01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:54.000
Advisor. what are your thoughts?

686
01:00:57.833 --> 01:00:59.291
I agree to this.

687
01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:02.291
I hope you will be successful

688
01:01:02.916 --> 01:01:05.250
in building a miniature steamboat
according to plan.

689
01:01:07.208 --> 01:01:08.458
Yes. sir.

690
01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:16.458
Imagine a crocodile coming from the right.

691
01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:19.500
turn the steering wheel to the left.

692
01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:26.875
But if it's coming from the left.

693
01:01:27.541 --> 01:01:29.375
turn the steering wheel to the right.

694
01:01:30.666 --> 01:01:32.916
I don't see
why there has to be a crocodile.

695
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.750
If I want to go left. I steer left.

696
01:01:34.833 --> 01:01:37.458
If I want to go right. I steer right.
It's easier to understand.

697
01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:39.500
Let me try.

698
01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:43.416
It's heavy.

699
01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:47.000
It's hard for you.

700
01:01:47.875 --> 01:01:51.000
Mathus.
I want to look at the steam engine.

701
01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:52.833
Can you take me to see it?

702
01:01:54.041 --> 01:01:55.833
What's wrong with him?

703
01:02:01.541 --> 01:02:02.750
What is this table?

704
01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:04.958
Is it to calculate the ship's route?

705
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.416
It's a game called tic-tac-toe.

706
01:02:09.791 --> 01:02:12.750
The captain must have been bored.
so he played it to pass the time.

707
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.375
And the two T's.

708
01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:21.375
what does it mean?

709
01:02:21.458 --> 01:02:24.583
I REALLY MISS MOM AND GRANDMA.

710
01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:27.250
Oh. it's a symbol.

711
01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:31.208
It's like a crying face.

712
01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:00.583
Hey.

713
01:03:06.708 --> 01:03:07.833
Ouch!

714
01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:14.375
It's just a cramp.

715
01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:15.708
Bear with it.

716
01:03:37.916 --> 01:03:38.750
Hey.

717
01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:41.833
Can I ask you a question?

718
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:46.375
What are your intentions with Gaysorn?

719
01:03:47.541 --> 01:03:48.541
Don't lie.

720
01:03:49.833 --> 01:03:50.666
Well…

721
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:52.583
I like her.

722
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.208
She's someone I want to go out with.

723
01:03:57.916 --> 01:03:59.583
Someone you want to go out with?

724
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:01.708
What does that mean?

725
01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:10.458
In my era.
it's normal for men and women to hang out.

726
01:04:10.541 --> 01:04:11.541
You don't have to overthink things.

727
01:04:15.958 --> 01:04:18.583
Miss Gaysorn is a sweet person.

728
01:04:19.583 --> 01:04:21.625
Anyone who meets her
would have to like her.

729
01:04:21.708 --> 01:04:24.625
But I'm going to return home.

730
01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:26.375
I won't court her.

731
01:04:30.458 --> 01:04:34.541
Honestly. your method doesn't work.

732
01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:39.541
Hey. how about this?

733
01:04:42.458 --> 01:04:44.041
Wear these sunglasses first.

734
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.791
I guarantee
it'll make girls go crazy for you.

735
01:04:46.875 --> 01:04:48.166
ASSUMPTION CHURCH

736
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:50.791
WORKSHOP

737
01:04:57.916 --> 01:04:59.583
You go over there.

738
01:05:12.833 --> 01:05:16.541
<i>When you are working on the miniature ship
is the best time.</i>

739
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:22.833
The first step is to bombard her
with "likes" to show your love.

740
01:05:22.916 --> 01:05:24.041
What?

741
01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:25.500
Do we need to use a bomb?

742
01:05:27.083 --> 01:05:30.291
What can we use in this era
to express your love for her?

743
01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:14.541
You used flowers
just like the 'heart' button in IG?

744
01:06:15.708 --> 01:06:16.583
Wow.

745
01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:18.583
Awesome!

746
01:06:20.458 --> 01:06:22.000
It's more like awful.

747
01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:24.000
An awful failure.

748
01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.708
Come on.

749
01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:32.208
Don't get discouraged.

750
01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:33.125
Let's keep on going.

751
01:06:33.208 --> 01:06:38.166
The second method is called
take care and take her heart.

752
01:06:45.125 --> 01:06:46.458
Have some water. sir.

753
01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:53.541
-Water…
-Art thou tired?

754
01:06:54.416 --> 01:06:55.458
Let me pass it for thee.

755
01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:00.666
Art thou tired?

756
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:01.791
Let me do it for thee.

757
01:07:20.041 --> 01:07:21.916
Art thou tired? I'll turn it for thee.

758
01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:25.250
Is this the page?

759
01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:27.791
Or is it this one?

760
01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:33.541
-Art thou tired?
-Will you please stop asking?

761
01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:45.208
The next step is the most important.

762
01:07:45.291 --> 01:07:46.791
This is the death step.

763
01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.541
Because it's the way
you fade out to make her anxious.

764
01:07:52.375 --> 01:07:55.916
I'm really tired of your funny wording.

765
01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:02.458
You'll have to disappear
to make her worried.

766
01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:08.708
And how can I disappear

767
01:08:08.791 --> 01:08:12.250
when I have to build the ship here?

768
01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:19.875
Let's just say do whatever you can.

769
01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:23.375
Just don't let Gaysorn see your face.

770
01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:32.500
Keep on rowing.

771
01:08:32.583 --> 01:08:33.416
Yes. sir.

772
01:08:35.916 --> 01:08:38.541
Doesn’t he come here
to build the miniature?

773
01:08:39.208 --> 01:08:40.416
Right. miss.

774
01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.083
Why is he passing by this way then?

775
01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:50.916
<i>When she hasn't seen your face
for a few days.</i>

776
01:08:51.416 --> 01:08:54.083
<i>she will come to you and ask…</i>

777
01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:04.125
What's wrong. Chief?

778
01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:07.250
I'm not free to talk right now.

779
01:09:08.083 --> 01:09:09.333
I'm not free in the evening either.

780
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.625
I'm meeting with a friend at the market.

781
01:09:13.375 --> 01:09:17.083
I'm not free to escort thee home either.

782
01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:23.083
Oh. the friend is a girl.

783
01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:32.833
I didn't know someone like you
had friends.

784
01:09:32.916 --> 01:09:34.250
And a girl friend too.

785
01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:37.166
Who is she?

786
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:41.500
I have someone I go-went-gone out with.

787
01:09:42.458 --> 01:09:43.833
Just. "go out with."

788
01:09:47.083 --> 01:09:49.750
But I haven't decided on anything yet.

789
01:09:49.833 --> 01:09:51.500
It's not anything serious.

790
01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:55.958
I've stopped believing in destiny already.

791
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.375
No wonder why you've been
acting strange lately.

792
01:10:04.458 --> 01:10:07.166
So you've finally stopped
believing in destiny.

793
01:10:09.875 --> 01:10:11.416
I'm happy for you. Chief.

794
01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:13.666
Congrats.

795
01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:19.000
Mathus.

796
01:10:19.083 --> 01:10:20.625
Want some mangoes?

797
01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:24.125
Your hand is dirty.

798
01:10:24.208 --> 01:10:25.875
It's all right. I'll feed you.

799
01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:28.583
Thanks. Gaysorn.

800
01:10:33.208 --> 01:10:34.125
Mathus!

801
01:10:43.666 --> 01:10:47.208
I will heat the boiler.

802
01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:50.208
The steam will flow through the pipes
to the piston valves.

803
01:10:50.291 --> 01:10:52.416
pressing them to move up and down.

804
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500
rotating the axle
that is attached to the paddle.

805
01:10:56.041 --> 01:11:01.708
And this is how the pressure used
to move the ship happens.

806
01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:12.958
Why is the paddle moving so fast?

807
01:11:14.916 --> 01:11:16.291
It's nothing.

808
01:11:16.916 --> 01:11:20.416
My machine is just that powerful.

809
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:38.958
Watch out!

810
01:12:04.791 --> 01:12:06.250
Are the two of you all right?

811
01:12:32.333 --> 01:12:34.416
You don't have to get the doctor.

812
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.583
I can ask one of the helps
to dress my wound.

813
01:12:39.916 --> 01:12:40.750
Hi.

814
01:12:41.375 --> 01:12:42.416
The doctor is here.

815
01:12:49.458 --> 01:12:50.875
It's gone in quite deep.

816
01:12:51.625 --> 01:12:53.125
It will need to be stitched up.

817
01:12:53.208 --> 01:12:54.041
Emelie.

818
01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:01.541
Chief.

819
01:13:01.625 --> 01:13:03.375
You don’t have to be afraid.

820
01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:06.375
In my time. Dr. Bradley is very famous.

821
01:13:06.458 --> 01:13:09.833
He's acclaimed
as the father of Thai printing.

822
01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:13.625
And what does it have to do
with my treatment?

823
01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:16.458
Doctor.

824
01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:20.041
Your newspaper
is called <i>Bangkok Recorder</i>. right?

825
01:13:24.541 --> 01:13:27.083
I've been looking for a name
for the newspaper.

826
01:13:27.166 --> 01:13:29.916
Good
but. please stitch up the wound first.

827
01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:35.791
If you fell the other way.

828
01:13:35.875 --> 01:13:39.583
your butt wouldn't have been stabbed
like this.

829
01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:40.875
It's good

830
01:13:41.708 --> 01:13:42.541
that I…

831
01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:45.791
covered you two.

832
01:13:45.875 --> 01:13:48.583
If not the pole…

833
01:13:50.166 --> 01:13:53.875
The pole might have stabbed you.

834
01:13:54.875 --> 01:13:55.916
Instead of going home…

835
01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:01.291
You might have been a ghost haunting

836
01:14:02.458 --> 01:14:03.833
the church here.

837
01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:07.916
Doctor.

838
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Can you take it easy?

839
01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:10.500
Just one more.

840
01:14:10.583 --> 01:14:12.208
Oh. he's detailed.

841
01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:15.250
You are unharmed.

842
01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:19.708
And Gaysorn is safe.

843
01:14:20.916 --> 01:14:22.916
It's my blessing.

844
01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:36.666
You really are a rare item.

845
01:14:37.833 --> 01:14:38.666
Rare…

846
01:14:40.291 --> 01:14:41.250
Rare what?

847
01:14:41.333 --> 01:14:43.708
Ouch!

848
01:14:43.791 --> 01:14:46.083
Oh. he's pulling no punches.

849
01:14:56.166 --> 01:14:57.875
Is it painful?

850
01:15:01.375 --> 01:15:02.333
Bhop.

851
01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:14.000
"Bhop."

852
01:15:36.041 --> 01:15:36.875
Ouch!

853
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:39.583
Ouch.

854
01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.333
Bhop.

855
01:15:44.083 --> 01:15:45.333
What's wrong with your hands?

856
01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:46.958
Does it hurt?

857
01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:48.291
May I take a look?

858
01:16:00.916 --> 01:16:01.958
Red ginger lily.

859
01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:06.916
People in the old days said
it means unchanging love.

860
01:16:09.583 --> 01:16:13.166
If it's the old saying.
then it might not be true now.

861
01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:20.000
But at this moment.

862
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.625
thy cheeks are as red as the lily.

863
01:16:33.958 --> 01:16:37.916
And your face
is now so big that the lily can't hide it.

864
01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:49.000
They're flirting.

865
01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:06.041
Art thou using

866
01:17:06.125 --> 01:17:08.916
the "take care and take my heart" method
with me?

867
01:17:32.625 --> 01:17:34.625
Oh. he just planted an entire tree.

868
01:17:39.125 --> 01:17:41.125
This time it's orchids.

869
01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:43.791
What does it mean?

870
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:47.333
It means

871
01:17:48.166 --> 01:17:52.666
a man's blooming love
towards a woman who is dear to him.

872
01:17:53.458 --> 01:17:55.083
but won't accept him yet.

873
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.458
Did people in the old days
clearly state that?

874
01:18:01.375 --> 01:18:02.708
It is my own saying.

875
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:05.333
No one from the old days said it.

876
01:18:41.666 --> 01:18:45.166
Chief is infatuated with you already.

877
01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:49.250
If he has a taste of your dessert.
he'll be head over heels in love

878
01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:51.041
as if he drinks a love potion.

879
01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.500
I only know how to make this.

880
01:18:56.583 --> 01:18:57.750
Take it.

881
01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:58.708
Yes. miss.

882
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:02.625
Oh. really?

883
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:04.583
Is it too fast?

884
01:19:05.166 --> 01:19:06.958
I think it's too late even.

885
01:19:07.625 --> 01:19:13.166
I've wanted to marry Gaysorn
since we first met.

886
01:19:17.125 --> 01:19:19.250
Don't be too obvious. miss.

887
01:19:20.416 --> 01:19:21.500
Can I ask you something?

888
01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:25.833
What makes you sure
Gaysorn is the right one?

889
01:19:32.916 --> 01:19:33.791
I have

890
01:19:35.916 --> 01:19:38.500
dreamed of her for over ten years.

891
01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.958
I've only dreamed of her.

892
01:19:44.208 --> 01:19:46.125
How could it not be?

893
01:19:46.833 --> 01:19:50.041
So you like her

894
01:19:50.125 --> 01:19:52.083
just because she reminds you of your ex?

895
01:19:54.541 --> 01:19:56.125
It's not just that they look alike.

896
01:19:57.333 --> 01:19:59.666
It's as if they're the same person!

897
01:20:00.833 --> 01:20:02.375
If this is your answer.

898
01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:04.625
I. as a bridesmaid.
won't allow this to pass.

899
01:20:05.375 --> 01:20:07.125
I'd tell you to go daydreaming.

900
01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:16.500
What book do you want me to translate?

901
01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:18.291
I'm in a rush to go home.
It's already late.

902
01:20:19.166 --> 01:20:21.458
There are some
Westerners' alphabet letters.

903
01:20:21.541 --> 01:20:22.875
I can't read it.

904
01:20:24.083 --> 01:20:26.208
I'd like for thou to translate it for me.

905
01:20:55.583 --> 01:20:56.708
Kneel on one knee.

906
01:21:03.916 --> 01:21:05.625
This magnolia garland…

907
01:21:06.125 --> 01:21:10.458
I grew the plant
and made the garland myself.

908
01:21:12.708 --> 01:21:17.541
I remember in our past life.
thou liked to tuck one behind thy hair.

909
01:21:21.375 --> 01:21:23.375
Will thou marry me?

910
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:31.000
What is the reason
that you want to marry me?

911
01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:39.958
If your answer is because
we're a destined couple.

912
01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.875
you don't need to answer me.

913
01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.958
That's not the only reason.

914
01:21:45.666 --> 01:21:46.875
I just think that…

915
01:21:48.958 --> 01:21:49.791
I…

916
01:21:51.208 --> 01:21:53.208
I've been getting hurt lately.

917
01:21:54.875 --> 01:21:57.500
It might be because
we haven't been married as promised.

918
01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:05.083
I'm very worried that one day
the person who gets hurt is thee.

919
01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:12.833
So if we weren't betrothed
because our lives depend on it.

920
01:22:14.083 --> 01:22:16.083
if you had never dreamed of me.

921
01:22:16.791 --> 01:22:19.041
if we were someone who had just met.

922
01:22:20.958 --> 01:22:23.416
would you still want to marry me?

923
01:22:28.708 --> 01:22:31.208
Will thou stop coming up
with things that aren't real?

924
01:22:32.958 --> 01:22:34.416
Will you stop calling me thou?

925
01:22:35.166 --> 01:22:38.208
I feel like you're talking
to someone else. not me.

926
01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:42.333
What are you worried about. Chief?

927
01:23:43.291 --> 01:23:45.458
The Prince will surely be satisfied

928
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:49.291
<i>with the miniature ship you made.</i>

929
01:24:03.375 --> 01:24:05.916
I thought
you wouldn't be able to complete it.

930
01:24:07.791 --> 01:24:09.708
But the miniature ship
is able to work perfectly.

931
01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:11.666
Chief. you truly do have
the skills it takes.

932
01:24:12.583 --> 01:24:14.041
I'm very impressed.

933
01:24:15.333 --> 01:24:16.208
This being the situation.

934
01:24:16.291 --> 01:24:20.750
shall I continue on
with purchasing the ship. sir?

935
01:24:24.875 --> 01:24:29.250
If our Siamese engineers are so skilled.
they can make their own ship themselves.

936
01:24:30.125 --> 01:24:34.416
I don't think there is any reason
to waste money on buying a ship

937
01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:35.916
from the British at all.

938
01:24:40.541 --> 01:24:42.041
Are you saying

939
01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:45.916
that we won't buy the ship
from Mr. Hunter. sir?

940
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.375
What if he reports this
to the British Army?

941
01:24:50.083 --> 01:24:51.916
Don't you use this to threaten me.

942
01:24:53.625 --> 01:24:55.208
I'm not afraid of those Westerners.

943
01:25:39.916 --> 01:25:43.750
{\an8}THE BRITISH FACTORY
ROYAL TREASURY PIER

944
01:25:43.833 --> 01:25:47.791
{\an8}THE PRINCE'S PALACE
THE PRINCE'S THEATER

945
01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:39.500
You're here. Pi?

946
01:26:39.583 --> 01:26:42.708
Come in. I'm almost done reading my book.

947
01:26:55.083 --> 01:26:56.541
Is Father Pallegoix here or not?

948
01:26:58.208 --> 01:26:59.166
He's not in.

949
01:26:59.958 --> 01:27:01.000
What business do you have?

950
01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:05.916
There's something suspicious
about the steamboat.

951
01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.291
I want to know if Lady Karaket
recorded this in her journal.

952
01:27:16.375 --> 01:27:19.875
Bhop. I think we should ask
for Pallegoix's permission first.

953
01:27:20.458 --> 01:27:22.583
He wouldn't allow it anyway.

954
01:27:23.291 --> 01:27:25.125
I just want to take a quick look.

955
01:27:40.958 --> 01:27:42.166
This is strange.

956
01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:44.250
Pallegoix shouldn't have
taken the chest elsewhere.

957
01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:54.083
Thou.

958
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:59.083
Bhop!

959
01:28:25.291 --> 01:28:26.500
You can't be trusted.

960
01:28:27.208 --> 01:28:29.375
Wait.

961
01:28:29.458 --> 01:28:31.708
Hold on. Please listen to me first.

962
01:28:32.291 --> 01:28:35.125
I just want to know something
from the Lady's journal.

963
01:28:40.458 --> 01:28:43.041
Once Mr. Hunter found out
that Siam wouldn't buy the ship.

964
01:28:44.083 --> 01:28:45.375
he was furious.

965
01:28:51.541 --> 01:28:52.458
Just you wait!

966
01:28:53.083 --> 01:28:54.125
If they don't buy my ship.

967
01:28:54.208 --> 01:28:56.708
I'll sell it to their enemy.

968
01:28:56.791 --> 01:29:00.708
Siam will lose to Cochinchina
because of this ship!

969
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.333
<i>So. I'd like to know…</i>

970
01:29:04.125 --> 01:29:06.333
what will happen with the steamboat.

971
01:29:11.958 --> 01:29:15.583
Well then. please let me take a look.

972
01:29:20.833 --> 01:29:23.500
I think we should
let it take its own course.

973
01:29:23.583 --> 01:29:25.666
just like Pallegoix said.

974
01:29:26.375 --> 01:29:27.208
But…

975
01:29:28.666 --> 01:29:29.791
How about this?

976
01:29:30.333 --> 01:29:31.208
Let's take a vote.

977
01:29:32.375 --> 01:29:33.416
Volt?

978
01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:34.416
Vote.

979
01:29:36.250 --> 01:29:37.083
How?

980
01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:40.791
Do what I say.

981
01:29:42.375 --> 01:29:46.000
Who thinks we should read the journal?

982
01:29:46.083 --> 01:29:47.000
Raise your hand.

983
01:29:55.291 --> 01:29:58.500
Next. who thinks we shouldn't read it?

984
01:29:58.583 --> 01:29:59.583
Raise your hand.

985
01:30:06.083 --> 01:30:08.083
All right. Open it.

986
01:30:08.166 --> 01:30:09.166
Hey!

987
01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:11.083
But I don't agree.

988
01:30:11.916 --> 01:30:15.833
The principle of voting is you have
to respect the majority's decision.

989
01:30:16.416 --> 01:30:21.208
And here. Chief and I. we have two votes.

990
01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:23.500
You have only one.

991
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:27.208
Oh. this is how it works.

992
01:30:28.875 --> 01:30:33.458
But if I still don't want you to read it.
what do I need to do?

993
01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:35.791
You just accept it.

994
01:30:51.833 --> 01:30:52.750
I found Hunter.

995
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.708
"Hunter brought the Express steamboat
to sell to Siam.

996
01:30:57.791 --> 01:30:59.625
but Siam turned down the purchase."

997
01:30:59.708 --> 01:31:02.541
"He then threatened
to sell the ship to Cochinchina.

998
01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:04.750
which is Vietnam in the future."

999
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:13.666
"After that.
Hunter was exiled from the country."

1000
01:31:14.541 --> 01:31:17.708
Just a threat resulted in exile?

1001
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:29.833
What else did the Lady say?

1002
01:31:33.541 --> 01:31:34.416
She…

1003
01:31:58.958 --> 01:32:00.083
What did you say?

1004
01:32:00.833 --> 01:32:03.791
The thunder was so loud
I couldn't hear you.

1005
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.541
I said
that was all the Lady wrote about Hunter.

1006
01:32:10.375 --> 01:32:12.708
And did she write about the Prince?

1007
01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.791
The Prince?

1008
01:32:17.833 --> 01:32:19.125
Yesterday

1009
01:32:19.208 --> 01:32:24.208
I saw some smuggling going on with crates
being brought from Hunter's steamboat

1010
01:32:24.291 --> 01:32:26.541
and stored in the Prince's theater.

1011
01:32:27.833 --> 01:32:29.750
Even though these two hate each other.

1012
01:32:29.833 --> 01:32:31.791
Do you know anything about this?

1013
01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:35.666
I have no idea.

1014
01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:40.083
I have a way to get into the theater.

1015
01:32:41.333 --> 01:32:42.625
Mathus.

1016
01:32:42.708 --> 01:32:45.625
Could you look through
Mr. Hunter's office?

1017
01:32:45.708 --> 01:32:49.958
There might be evidence
that you could bring to me.

1018
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:06.083
Do not worry.

1019
01:33:07.666 --> 01:33:09.166
Tomorrow when the sun is swallowed.

1020
01:33:11.041 --> 01:33:13.166
we'll send off Mathus together.

1021
01:34:12.416 --> 01:34:15.291
When will the person
from the theater bring the keys?

1022
01:34:15.375 --> 01:34:16.833
No one is coming.

1023
01:34:17.458 --> 01:34:18.833
We'll break in.

1024
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:26.583
I'll take a look to see
if anyone is guarding that area.

1025
01:34:26.666 --> 01:34:27.916
Whoa.

1026
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.291
It's pitch dark.

1027
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:36.666
That's your windpipe.

1028
01:34:53.708 --> 01:34:54.541
Bhop.

1029
01:35:23.875 --> 01:35:25.875
Phu. what are you doing. sir?

1030
01:35:28.666 --> 01:35:32.083
I brought a performer
for the master to consider.

1031
01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:42.083
He's famous in Klang city.

1032
01:35:42.666 --> 01:35:46.166
The master asked him to try on the outfit.

1033
01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:50.791
But the room is locked.

1034
01:35:50.875 --> 01:35:54.208
I'm going to go get the key to unlock it.

1035
01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:55.291
Hold on.

1036
01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:01.666
Today is my shift to guard the store room.

1037
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:09.666
Are you really a famous performer?

1038
01:36:12.875 --> 01:36:14.166
Show me.

1039
01:36:22.958 --> 01:36:24.625
Your moves are awkward.

1040
01:36:25.125 --> 01:36:27.333
How can the people of Klang like you?

1041
01:36:32.833 --> 01:36:33.958
What is that?

1042
01:36:36.208 --> 01:36:38.083
I don't think you're a performer.

1043
01:36:38.166 --> 01:36:39.083
Who is he. sir?

1044
01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.500
Phu. why did you hit me?

1045
01:36:50.291 --> 01:36:51.500
So this is it.

1046
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.041
The magical windpipe
that makes people fall asleep.

1047
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.416
Khun Yutthamat.

1048
01:38:03.416 --> 01:38:05.208
That's my butler.

1049
01:38:05.291 --> 01:38:07.375
He gave me a ride here.

1050
01:38:07.458 --> 01:38:08.750
He's trustworthy.

1051
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:15.333
I already told you.

1052
01:38:15.416 --> 01:38:17.541
Do not bring anyone with you.

1053
01:38:25.625 --> 01:38:26.875
What's in the chest?

1054
01:38:28.625 --> 01:38:29.625
Let's open it.

1055
01:38:37.375 --> 01:38:39.041
It's just curtains for the backdrop.

1056
01:38:39.125 --> 01:38:43.083
I knew it. It's just all in your head.

1057
01:39:00.666 --> 01:39:02.416
With all these muskets.

1058
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.666
the Prince and Hunter
are definitely planning a coup.

1059
01:39:13.041 --> 01:39:13.875
You.

1060
01:39:13.958 --> 01:39:15.583
What did you hear?

1061
01:39:17.041 --> 01:39:18.500
I didn't really hear anything.

1062
01:39:31.958 --> 01:39:33.083
Sir.

1063
01:39:33.708 --> 01:39:36.333
Why did you follow me then?

1064
01:39:40.416 --> 01:39:43.083
Who are you really? Tell me.

1065
01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:53.416
LUANG AWUTWISET

1066
01:39:54.375 --> 01:39:58.416
This pistol has been kept over a century
as a family heirloom.

1067
01:39:59.541 --> 01:40:01.291
I'm your descendant.

1068
01:40:03.291 --> 01:40:04.625
I came from the future.

1069
01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:08.625
I mean. I came from the time ahead.

1070
01:40:11.666 --> 01:40:13.791
What are you talking about?

1071
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.041
Sir.

1072
01:40:21.625 --> 01:40:23.833
Don't follow the Prince's plan.

1073
01:40:25.666 --> 01:40:29.708
<i>Otherwise. you'll be exiled from Siam.</i>

1074
01:40:33.208 --> 01:40:37.666
The Prince and I planned for Siam
to turn down the deal in the first place.

1075
01:40:51.833 --> 01:40:54.625
I agreed to make the deal
because the Prince will make me

1076
01:40:55.333 --> 01:41:00.791
the Minister of the Royal Treasury.
overseeing all the trades in Siam.

1077
01:41:09.541 --> 01:41:10.375
Sir!

1078
01:41:16.833 --> 01:41:18.000
Sir!

1079
01:41:19.125 --> 01:41:20.250
Don’t do this. sir!

1080
01:41:21.541 --> 01:41:24.791
Tomorrow. when I'm done with my business.

1081
01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.666
I will send you off to be a slave
in Singapore.

1082
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:32.750
Sir!

1083
01:41:34.416 --> 01:41:35.708
I'm begging you.

1084
01:41:35.791 --> 01:41:37.208
I have to return home tomorrow!

1085
01:41:40.041 --> 01:41:40.916
Sir!

1086
01:41:52.625 --> 01:41:54.833
Go to bed first. miss.

1087
01:41:55.833 --> 01:41:57.875
The Chief will come soon.

1088
01:42:01.041 --> 01:42:02.208
I can't fall asleep.

1089
01:42:37.833 --> 01:42:39.083
Is this an ominous sign?

1090
01:42:42.666 --> 01:42:43.583
What sign. miss?

1091
01:42:44.375 --> 01:42:45.750
I couldn't hear you.

1092
01:43:24.958 --> 01:43:26.458
What's with the chair?

1093
01:43:27.708 --> 01:43:29.125
Are you tidying up the room?

1094
01:43:29.208 --> 01:43:30.458
Chief.

1095
01:43:32.333 --> 01:43:33.166
Let go.

1096
01:43:35.666 --> 01:43:36.916
I didn't see you coming.

1097
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:40.291
Just what I thought.
Something bad happened.

1098
01:43:43.541 --> 01:43:45.125
Mr. Hunter locked me up

1099
01:43:46.541 --> 01:43:48.416
because I knew his secret.

1100
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.125
What evidence did you find?

1101
01:44:02.250 --> 01:44:04.125
<i>In the Lady Karaket's journal.</i>

1102
01:44:04.833 --> 01:44:08.625
{\an8}<i>it said the reason Mr. Hunter was exiled </i>

1103
01:44:08.708 --> 01:44:12.958
{\an8}<i>was because he put cannons
aboard the steamboat</i>

1104
01:44:14.041 --> 01:44:15.541
{\an8}<i>and fired them at the city wall.</i>

1105
01:44:25.791 --> 01:44:27.083
And now Mr. Hunter…

1106
01:44:30.625 --> 01:44:32.750
He's heading to the steamboat.

1107
01:44:50.458 --> 01:44:52.000
Didn't Chief come with you?

1108
01:44:57.125 --> 01:44:58.708
Mr. Hunter is preparing a coup.

1109
01:45:00.125 --> 01:45:01.541
They're planning to hand Siam
to the British

1110
01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:04.708
according to the order from the Prince.

1111
01:45:06.708 --> 01:45:10.416
You don't know this because I tore
the page out from the journal.

1112
01:45:10.500 --> 01:45:13.000
What is the reason
for hiding this from me?

1113
01:45:13.958 --> 01:45:17.750
I was afraid that if you knew.

1114
01:45:19.291 --> 01:45:21.291
you would arrest Mr. Hunter

1115
01:45:23.666 --> 01:45:25.666
even though he hasn't done anything yet.

1116
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:27.791
You really are selfish.

1117
01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:30.375
You're just worried for your ancestor.

1118
01:45:30.916 --> 01:45:32.750
Have you forgotten
about the people of this country?

1119
01:45:35.041 --> 01:45:36.333
No wonder why the Prince

1120
01:45:36.416 --> 01:45:39.125
took the Minister of the Royal Treasury
and my father

1121
01:45:39.208 --> 01:45:40.875
away for urgent work at Pak Nam.

1122
01:45:45.833 --> 01:45:47.375
I'll go home to send an express horse

1123
01:45:47.458 --> 01:45:48.916
to tell Father to return quickly.

1124
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:50.583
Gaysorn.

1125
01:45:52.875 --> 01:45:53.708
This is for you.

1126
01:45:56.041 --> 01:45:56.958
Miss.

1127
01:46:14.125 --> 01:46:16.416
TO MATHUS. WE WISH FOR YOUR HAPPINESS

1128
01:46:16.500 --> 01:46:18.208
IN 177 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE.

1129
01:46:18.291 --> 01:46:19.791
WE WILL MISS YOU.

1130
01:47:30.291 --> 01:47:33.625
Pi. give this letter to the express horse
and send it to Father.

1131
01:47:34.375 --> 01:47:35.708
Where are you going. miss?

1132
01:47:36.541 --> 01:47:38.166
Are you going after the Chief?

1133
01:47:38.250 --> 01:47:39.458
Don't worry about me.

1134
01:47:39.541 --> 01:47:40.875
Pi. go right now.

1135
01:47:41.375 --> 01:47:43.750
Miss. please don't go.

1136
01:47:43.833 --> 01:47:45.041
It's dangerous.

1137
01:47:46.125 --> 01:47:47.750
Miss. please don't go.

1138
01:47:47.833 --> 01:47:49.375
-Pi!
-Miss!

1139
01:47:49.458 --> 01:47:50.583
Quickly go now.

1140
01:47:50.666 --> 01:47:54.208
Your lifeline might be reaching its end.

1141
01:47:55.333 --> 01:47:58.958
No matter what. I can't let you go.

1142
01:47:59.041 --> 01:47:59.916
No!

1143
01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.458
-Let go of me!
-Please don't go. miss!

1144
01:48:02.541 --> 01:48:03.416
Pi!

1145
01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:04.333
Pi!

1146
01:48:22.166 --> 01:48:24.583
Pi. I'm begging you.

1147
01:48:25.416 --> 01:48:28.875
Send this letter to Father right now.

1148
01:48:30.875 --> 01:48:32.041
Miss.

1149
01:49:10.375 --> 01:49:11.708
Stop. Mr. Hunter.

1150
01:49:14.208 --> 01:49:17.541
The Police Colonel is bringing
the soldiers and police here.

1151
01:49:17.625 --> 01:49:19.666
Stop what you're doing.

1152
01:49:23.625 --> 01:49:24.541
Miss.

1153
01:49:25.458 --> 01:49:29.583
What is the Police Colonel
going to arrest me for?

1154
01:49:30.208 --> 01:49:32.416
It just happens
that today is Captain Brown's birthday.

1155
01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:35.208
He's the captain of this steamboat.

1156
01:49:35.291 --> 01:49:37.041
According to our traditions.

1157
01:49:37.125 --> 01:49:40.708
we have to take the ship out
to fire a celebratory salute.

1158
01:49:41.791 --> 01:49:44.333
I know you're planning
to do some bad things.

1159
01:49:58.625 --> 01:49:59.916
-How did you get here?
-Who is there?

1160
01:50:00.583 --> 01:50:01.500
Help!

1161
01:50:01.583 --> 01:50:02.750
Help me.

1162
01:50:02.833 --> 01:50:03.791
Help me.

1163
01:50:13.916 --> 01:50:15.208
Help!

1164
01:50:15.291 --> 01:50:17.333
Help me.

1165
01:52:15.041 --> 01:52:16.541
Sir. what are you doing?

1166
01:52:17.041 --> 01:52:19.583
Aren't we just going to fire up
into the sky?

1167
01:52:19.666 --> 01:52:22.833
Aiming in that direction
is firing at the city wall.

1168
01:52:23.416 --> 01:52:24.791
That's right.

1169
01:52:25.583 --> 01:52:27.500
Won't we all lose our heads?

1170
01:52:28.041 --> 01:52:29.750
Not all of us.

1171
01:52:30.541 --> 01:52:31.375
Just you.

1172
01:52:32.083 --> 01:52:33.875
And your cronies.

1173
01:53:54.791 --> 01:53:59.000
You can sweet talk the Prince into buying…

1174
01:54:00.250 --> 01:54:05.375
I believe that if we purchase
this steamboat.

1175
01:54:05.458 --> 01:54:09.041
Siam will be a feared armed force
in the region.

1176
01:54:09.125 --> 01:54:11.458
<i>…or not buying this steamboat.</i>

1177
01:54:11.541 --> 01:54:13.625
The decision is yours to make.

1178
01:54:14.166 --> 01:54:16.750
The ship is not in an ideal state.

1179
01:54:16.833 --> 01:54:21.000
Siam has the capability
to build our own ship.

1180
01:54:21.083 --> 01:54:25.958
I don't think that we need
to buy the ship from those Westerners.

1181
01:54:35.958 --> 01:54:37.541
<i>"Pao Hoo."</i>

1182
01:54:37.625 --> 01:54:40.250
<i>Pao Hoo! Pao Hoo.</i>

1183
01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:47.791
Bhop.

1184
01:58:49.333 --> 01:58:50.791
Are you all right?

1185
01:58:52.958 --> 01:58:55.250
A moment ago. was I

1186
01:58:57.541 --> 01:58:58.750
cool?

1187
01:59:03.458 --> 01:59:06.416
Freakin' cool. Mr. Sailor!

1188
01:59:08.041 --> 01:59:10.916
But right now. please free me.

1189
01:59:15.625 --> 01:59:18.041
Thou and Mathus
quickly find a hiding place.

1190
01:59:18.541 --> 01:59:19.458
I’ll try to stall them

1191
01:59:20.041 --> 01:59:21.666
while we're waiting
for the troops to come.

1192
01:59:28.083 --> 01:59:29.625
In the time ahead.

1193
01:59:30.458 --> 01:59:32.791
will Siam be a colony under the British?

1194
01:59:33.708 --> 01:59:34.833
Never.

1195
01:59:34.916 --> 01:59:36.083
If so…

1196
01:59:37.166 --> 01:59:41.250
I will make your history

1197
01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:43.541
the same.

1198
01:59:48.666 --> 01:59:50.500
You really are a good ancestor.

1199
02:00:00.125 --> 02:00:00.958
Bhop.

1200
02:00:01.666 --> 02:00:02.875
What about Mr. Hunter?

1201
02:00:18.666 --> 02:00:20.000
Bhop. watch out!

1202
02:00:20.833 --> 02:00:22.125
Hey!

1203
02:00:34.833 --> 02:00:35.708
Mathus.

1204
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:53.625
Run!

1205
02:01:07.958 --> 02:01:09.000
Wait.

1206
02:01:23.041 --> 02:01:23.916
Go after them!

1207
02:01:28.833 --> 02:01:29.916
You go in first. I'll stall them.

1208
02:01:31.625 --> 02:01:32.583
Don't worry.

1209
02:01:33.916 --> 02:01:34.750
Oops.

1210
02:01:43.875 --> 02:01:45.833
Damn. is that The Hulk?

1211
02:01:46.583 --> 02:01:47.750
SLOW

1212
02:01:51.791 --> 02:01:54.958
Crocodile is on the left.
steer the ship to the right.

1213
02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:59.750
The city wall is on the right.
turn the wheel to the left!

1214
02:02:30.333 --> 02:02:31.208
It's nothing.

1215
02:02:31.875 --> 02:02:33.083
I can take it.

1216
02:02:35.250 --> 02:02:37.833
The masseuse I know
has heavier elbows than you!

1217
02:02:41.708 --> 02:02:45.208
Wait. Chill. man.

1218
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.250
Barn owl!

1219
02:03:37.208 --> 02:03:38.166
Help me.

1220
02:04:14.041 --> 02:04:14.875
Shoot. damn it!

1221
02:05:05.958 --> 02:05:08.375
Aim towards the city wall.
Don't miss it again.

1222
02:05:39.125 --> 02:05:41.333
Hold on. Take it easy.

1223
02:06:13.125 --> 02:06:14.000
Whoa!

1224
02:06:14.083 --> 02:06:16.125
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

1225
02:06:16.208 --> 02:06:17.875
My ears are about to burst!

1226
02:06:41.541 --> 02:06:42.666
Are you a British spy?

1227
02:06:57.875 --> 02:06:58.916
It takes

1228
02:06:59.708 --> 02:07:01.375
a lot of effort and time

1229
02:07:01.458 --> 02:07:02.750
to load the bullets.

1230
02:07:02.833 --> 02:07:05.333
Don't you get that?

1231
02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:05.291
What kind of ominous day is this?

1232
02:10:15.833 --> 02:10:16.833
Don't shoot!

1233
02:10:17.708 --> 02:10:19.250
It might take you forward in time.

1234
02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:50.208
I forgot the bullet.

1235
02:11:15.375 --> 02:11:17.750
Wherever this pistol will take thee.

1236
02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:21.375
I'm going with thee too.

1237
02:12:30.916 --> 02:12:31.750
Bhop!

1238
02:12:32.416 --> 02:12:33.250
Gaysorn!

1239
02:13:30.833 --> 02:13:31.875
Your lady is awake.

1240
02:13:32.958 --> 02:13:35.958
Bring some water for her
to get freshen up right now.

1241
02:13:36.041 --> 02:13:38.250
Yes. sir. Khun Sriwisarnwaja.

1242
02:13:47.625 --> 02:13:49.208
How art thou. my dear Karaket?

1243
02:13:50.500 --> 02:13:52.208
Thou were dead asleep.

1244
02:15:04.291 --> 02:15:07.958
THIS JOURNAL IS MADE AS A RECORD
OF EVENTS IN AYUTTHAYA ERA.

1245
02:15:11.583 --> 02:15:15.916
MY NAME IS KETSURANG.
I'M A FOURTH-YEAR ARCHEOLOGY STUDENT.

1246
02:15:46.791 --> 02:15:49.666
Thou have filled up all the pages
in thy journal. correct?

1247
02:15:51.583 --> 02:15:52.791
It's all right.

1248
02:15:53.458 --> 02:15:57.583
I'll have someone make new ones for thee.
just like this one.

1249
02:16:34.541 --> 02:16:35.833
Found them!

1250
02:16:35.916 --> 02:16:36.916
Found them!

1251
02:16:40.708 --> 02:16:41.541
<i>Gaysorn.</i>

1252
02:16:41.625 --> 02:16:43.333
Do you hear me?

1253
02:16:43.416 --> 02:16:44.250
Gaysorn!

1254
02:16:45.875 --> 02:16:47.000
She's not breathing.

1255
02:16:47.083 --> 02:16:48.833
We have to give her CPR.

1256
02:16:49.625 --> 02:16:50.750
Put your right hand over your left.

1257
02:16:51.375 --> 02:16:53.291
Press into the middle
of her chest real hard.

1258
02:16:56.208 --> 02:16:57.041
Harder!

1259
02:16:58.958 --> 02:16:59.791
Gaysorn.

1260
02:17:00.375 --> 02:17:01.458
Gaysorn.

1261
02:17:01.541 --> 02:17:02.375
Next.

1262
02:17:02.458 --> 02:17:05.416
Pinch her nose
and blow air into her mouth twice.

1263
02:17:08.666 --> 02:17:09.541
Blow…

1264
02:17:11.291 --> 02:17:13.916
Blow air into her mouth by using my mouth?

1265
02:17:15.791 --> 02:17:16.625
I can't.

1266
02:17:16.708 --> 02:17:17.750
There's no time.

1267
02:17:17.833 --> 02:17:18.958
I'll do it then.

1268
02:17:51.375 --> 02:17:53.416
…if you had never dreamed of me.

1269
02:17:54.083 --> 02:17:56.416
if we were someone who had just met.

1270
02:17:58.583 --> 02:18:01.500
<i>would you still want to marry me?</i>

1271
02:18:43.375 --> 02:18:44.250
Gaysorn.

1272
02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:46.916
Gaysorn.

1273
02:18:53.250 --> 02:18:54.083
Gaysorn.

1274
02:18:54.833 --> 02:18:55.791
Gaysorn.

1275
02:18:57.333 --> 02:18:58.166
Gaysorn.

1276
02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:26.833
Bhop.

1277
02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:00.416
What a waste…

1278
02:20:03.416 --> 02:20:04.666
of the respect

1279
02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:08.416
and trust I had in you.

1280
02:20:10.458 --> 02:20:13.625
Why did you use my name

1281
02:20:14.208 --> 02:20:15.916
to start a coup?

1282
02:20:23.166 --> 02:20:28.875
All that I did was for you. sir.

1283
02:21:40.833 --> 02:21:41.666
Let's go.

1284
02:22:12.875 --> 02:22:16.416
In the name of Siam.
we need to arrest you.

1285
02:22:18.208 --> 02:22:19.750
Please do not resist.

1286
02:22:54.791 --> 02:22:57.208
That pistol probably took you here
for this reason.

1287
02:22:59.541 --> 02:23:00.375
But

1288
02:23:00.958 --> 02:23:04.416
I'm sorry that I lost your pistol.

1289
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:14.583
God or other sacred beings

1290
02:23:15.666 --> 02:23:17.333
must have wanted the pistol here.

1291
02:23:17.958 --> 02:23:20.541
But the pistol couldn't come on its own.

1292
02:23:21.291 --> 02:23:22.833
So I had to come with it too.

1293
02:23:45.375 --> 02:23:47.250
You really are a good descendant.

1294
02:24:28.541 --> 02:24:34.333
<i>The news from abroad states that
when Mr. Hunter was exiled.</i>

1295
02:24:34.416 --> 02:24:38.833
<i>he sold the steamboat to Cochinchina</i>

1296
02:24:38.916 --> 02:24:41.875
<i>for 67.000 dollars.</i>

1297
02:24:57.416 --> 02:24:58.458
I know

1298
02:24:59.208 --> 02:25:01.250
that you all secretly read the journal.

1299
02:25:02.583 --> 02:25:03.416
But

1300
02:25:04.416 --> 02:25:07.791
I also know
the journal used to belong to you.

1301
02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:09.791
You keep it.

1302
02:25:23.208 --> 02:25:27.333
I probably won't read
Lady Karaket's journal anymore.

1303
02:25:30.375 --> 02:25:32.583
I'm determined to record

1304
02:25:32.666 --> 02:25:35.750
the events of the world
I am living in now.

1305
02:25:35.833 --> 02:25:37.291
In my own way.

1306
02:25:45.625 --> 02:25:48.958
I will record the events of Siam
in my own way as well.

1307
02:25:50.666 --> 02:25:54.041
This is how history is.

1308
02:25:54.125 --> 02:25:55.666
The same event.

1309
02:25:56.750 --> 02:26:00.000
different people recording.
different perspectives.

1310
02:27:44.041 --> 02:27:48.833
LUANG AWUTWISET

1311
02:28:51.166 --> 02:28:52.125
Mathus.

1312
02:28:53.041 --> 02:28:54.333
Mathus.

1313
02:28:54.416 --> 02:28:55.541
Mathus!

1314
02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:00.500
Pei.

1315
02:29:49.916 --> 02:29:52.125
Did Chief Sombatbordi come to our house?

1316
02:29:53.125 --> 02:29:55.583
Yes. but I chased him away.

1317
02:29:55.666 --> 02:29:59.916
He came to confess to me
that he has taken liberties with you.

1318
02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:05.791
He would like to take responsibility
and marry you.

1319
02:30:08.291 --> 02:30:09.125
What?

1320
02:30:19.041 --> 02:30:19.916
Oh. no.

1321
02:30:33.333 --> 02:30:34.375
Hi there!

1322
02:30:35.958 --> 02:30:36.791
Hey!

1323
02:30:42.041 --> 02:30:42.958
Miss.

1324
02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.041
May I hitch a ride on your boat?

1325
02:31:00.750 --> 02:31:04.000
Can you please row faster? I'm in a rush.

1326
02:31:13.541 --> 02:31:14.375
Miss.

1327
02:31:14.958 --> 02:31:16.000
Please let me.

1328
02:31:36.791 --> 02:31:38.041
Bhop!

1329
02:31:39.416 --> 02:31:40.791
Bhop.

1330
02:31:41.708 --> 02:31:43.083
Bhop!

1331
02:31:46.833 --> 02:31:47.666
Bhop!

1332
02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:49.416
Bhop!

1333
02:31:50.916 --> 02:31:52.458
Bhop!

1334
02:31:56.500 --> 02:31:57.833
Bhop!

1335
02:32:00.666 --> 02:32:02.000
Bhop!

1336
02:32:17.250 --> 02:32:18.208
Don't you

1337
02:32:18.833 --> 02:32:20.916
have any flowers for me today?

1338
02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.250
A kafferboom.

1339
02:32:36.916 --> 02:32:38.166
I collected from thy house.

1340
02:32:48.833 --> 02:32:50.416
Did you know?

1341
02:32:51.416 --> 02:32:53.125
People in the old days said

1342
02:32:54.583 --> 02:32:58.791
whoever smells the kafferboom
will remember their past life.

1343
02:33:01.875 --> 02:33:02.708
I know.

1344
02:33:05.708 --> 02:33:08.041
Which is why I've never given thee one.

1345
02:33:15.416 --> 02:33:19.750
That day I drowned. I dreamed and saw

1346
02:33:21.625 --> 02:33:24.416
that our past lives together was real.

1347
02:33:28.583 --> 02:33:30.416
I was Lady Karaket.

1348
02:33:32.125 --> 02:33:34.333
You were Khun Sriwisarnwaja.

1349
02:33:47.041 --> 02:33:48.041
All right.

1350
02:33:48.708 --> 02:33:50.458
Us two will leave now.

1351
02:34:06.125 --> 02:34:08.166
Do you believe what I said?

1352
02:34:10.166 --> 02:34:13.583
Whether I believe it or not.
it's not important anymore.

1353
02:34:16.708 --> 02:34:18.333
Because ever since I've met thee.

1354
02:34:20.250 --> 02:34:22.666
I've never dreamed of Lady Karaket again.

1355
02:34:27.541 --> 02:34:31.125
Because the person I think of is thee.

1356
02:34:34.666 --> 02:34:36.958
The person who I love in this life.

1357
02:35:05.916 --> 02:35:10.125
The photograph will be evidence
we can leave for our children

1358
02:35:10.208 --> 02:35:14.541
that the times we were together are real.

1359
02:35:15.250 --> 02:35:18.500
But the locals are saying

1360
02:35:19.083 --> 02:35:20.958
this box pulls souls into it.

1361
02:35:21.875 --> 02:35:27.125
How about I draw ten pictures of thee
to make up for it?

1362
02:35:29.125 --> 02:35:31.291
You don't have to be afraid.

1363
02:35:31.916 --> 02:35:34.041
If this box pulls souls into it…

1364
02:35:39.583 --> 02:35:41.291
I will go with you.

1365
02:35:49.416 --> 02:35:50.916
Stand still.

1366
02:35:53.083 --> 02:35:55.500
<i>One. two. three.</i>

1367
02:35:57.916 --> 02:35:59.541
My dej-ti-ny.

1368
02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:39.958
Right here. uncle.

1369
02:37:40.458 --> 02:37:41.291
I remember.

1370
02:37:42.041 --> 02:37:44.416
In my last life.
I buried it with my own hands.

1371
02:37:46.375 --> 02:37:48.750
An angel told me in my dream.

1372
02:37:49.916 --> 02:37:53.208
I wasn't worthy of protecting it.

1373
02:37:54.541 --> 02:37:57.958
It should be kept
underneath Ayutthaya soil.

1374
02:38:00.166 --> 02:38:01.458
For the future.

1375
02:38:15.208 --> 02:38:17.291
2022

1376
02:38:21.333 --> 02:38:23.291
PUTTARN_PT

1377
02:38:25.166 --> 02:38:26.000
Miss Puttarn.

1378
02:38:27.166 --> 02:38:28.125
Will you come take a look over here?
