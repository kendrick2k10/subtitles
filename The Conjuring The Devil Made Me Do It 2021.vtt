17
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.625
Hon. are you feeling
all right?

18
00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:44.708
Yeah. I'm fine.

[sighs]

20
00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:51.458
I just can't remember
one quite like this.

21
00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.875
He should try and get
some sleep.

22
00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.333
Yeah. Here you go.

23
00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:05.916
-Oh. I'll take him.
Mr. Glatzel.
-Huh?

24
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:07.375
Yeah.

25
00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:08.708
Thank you.

00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:11.833
-Thank you. Arne.
-No problem. Come on. buddy.

27
00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:17.500
He can't take much more
of this.

28
00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:19.250
He won't have to.

29
00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:22.166
Things will move quickly
now that the exorcism's
been approved.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.208
Father Gordon's already
on his way.

You're one brave kid.
you know?

32
00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:38.375
I was a little runt growing up.

33
00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.666
so I know what it's like
to be picked on.

34
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.291
But...

35
00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.375
But that was nothing compared
to what you're going through.

36
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.083
I don't feel very brave.

37
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.958
Being brave doesn't mean
you're not scared.

38
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:56.791
It means you are scared
but you hang in there.

39
00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.791
It's gonna be all right.

40
00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:03.166
I won't let anything
happen to you.

41
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.916
I promise.

42
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.916

ask my sister to marry you?

44
00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:14.791
I don't know what
you're talking about.

45

-I've... I've been thinking...
-Mmm-hmm.

182
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.000
And now David's
out of the woods.

183
00:12:53.083 --> 00:12:56.750
maybe we should
put all this behind us

184
00:12:56.833 --> 00:13:00.000
and get out of this place.

185
00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:02.916
-You know?
-You mean. leave Brookfield?

186
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.291
Sure. why not?
We've got nothing keeping
us here now. Do we?

187
00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:07.041
Oh. yeah.
Nothing but my family

188
00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:09.375
and all the money
we don't have. Arne--

189
00:13:09.458 --> 00:13:11.000
Okay. well.
money's no big deal. right?

190
00:13:11.083 --> 00:13:12.291
We're both working.

191
00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.250
and this place doesn't
cost us anything.

192
00:13:14.333 --> 00:13:17.166
Arne. I just started this job.
I can't just up
and walk out now.

193
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.208
-[Bruno] Jesus Christ!
-And besides.

194
00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:21.500
Bruno doesn't know
the first thing about
taking care of these dogs.

195
00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:25.875
Hey...

196
00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.958
Let me think about it. Okay?

197
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:32.791
-You'll think about it?
-Yeah. I'll think about it.

198
00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:36.958
Okay. There we go.

199
00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:39.958
Okay. get dressed.

200

-I think David will love that.

202
00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:49.375
-Did you call my mom?
-[Arne] Yeah. I did.

203
00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:51.375
-I told her we were going
to be very late.
-Okay. thank you.

204
00:13:51.458 --> 00:13:54.416
No. Arne. Please stop eating.

205
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.166
Mrs. Haskett.
so good to see you.
thanks for coming by.

206
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.041
-Hey. we're headed out now.
-Bye. Pookie.

207
00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:01.291
I wrote down a list of stuff
for you to do
while we're gone.

208
00:14:01.375 --> 00:14:04.875
Oh. keeping track of this stuff
is what I'm supposed to be
paying you for.

209
00:14:04.958 --> 00:14:06.125
Not on weekends. you're not.

210
00:14:06.208 --> 00:14:07.833
I'm letting you live here
rent free.

211
00:14:07.916 --> 00:14:10.708
That should buy me the weekends
maybe the holidays. too.

212
00:14:10.791 --> 00:14:12.958
Okay. Andy gets one cup.
everyone else gets two.

213
00:14:13.041 --> 00:14:15.583
Magic and Sparky are getting
picked up. so you don't need
to worry about them.

214
00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:18.416
But. you'll have to take
everyone else outside at some
point this afternoon.

215
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.000
Oh. Ruby's allergic to bees.
if she gets stung you've got
to call the emergency vet.

216
00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:23.833
I wrote the number down
and stuck it on the fridge.

217

218
00:14:25.208 --> 00:14:27.833
Yo. Arne. you wanna make
a quick five bucks. man?

219
00:14:27.916 --> 00:14:29.583
My stereo's busted.

220
00:14:29.666 --> 00:14:34.166

I'll take a look at it later.
But. make it 15.

-I know.

223

Ma. okay.
Please don't say anything.

224

I won't say anything.
I promise.

225
00:14:43.166 --> 00:14:44.333
Okay. just...

226
00:14:44.416 --> 00:14:47.000
He asked if we could
leave Brookfield.

227
00:14:47.083 --> 00:14:49.833
-[gasps] You know what
that means. don't you?
-No.

228
00:14:49.916 --> 00:14:52.958
-Actually. you mean
he proposed?
-Not exactly.

229
00:14:53.041 --> 00:14:54.750
-Did you say. yes?
-Not exactly.

230
00:14:54.833 --> 00:14:57.458
Arne! Can you bring out
the tray with the meat on it?

231
00:14:57.541 --> 00:14:59.791
Oh. yes. I'm starving!
Are you starving. bud?

232
00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:00.750
Yeah.

233
00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.375

I don't know. um.
it depends if...

247
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.541
The nurse says that you
have been sleeping
in that chair.

248
00:17:44.375 --> 00:17:47.541
Ed would understand if you went
home for a little while.

249
00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:53.625
Did I ever tell you the story
of how we met?

250
00:17:53.708 --> 00:17:55.375
No. I don't think so.

251
00:17:55.458 --> 00:17:58.458
Just that you were young.
In high school. wasn't it?

252
00:17:58.541 --> 00:18:00.250
Yeah. We were 17.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.291
Or who shall stand
in his holy place?

351
00:25:50.375 --> 00:25:54.083
He that hath clean hands.
and a pure heart.

352
00:25:54.166 --> 00:25:57.125
who hath not lifted up
his soul unto vanity.

353
00:25:57.208 --> 00:25:59.583
nor sworn deceitfully.

354
00:25:59.666 --> 00:26:02.041
He shall receive the blessing
from the Lord.

355
00:26:02.125 --> 00:26:05.125
and righteousness from the God
of his salvation.

356
00:26:05.208 --> 00:26:07.041
[Ed] Right. That's enough.

357
00:26:07.125 --> 00:26:08.333
Thank you.

358
00:26:12.833 --> 00:26:14.791
Well?

359
00:26:14.875 --> 00:26:17.000
These religious objects
would've been enough

360
00:26:17.083 --> 00:26:19.500
to provoke an inhuman spirit.

361
00:26:19.583 --> 00:26:21.458
if there was one present.

362
00:26:23.208 --> 00:26:27.166
Does that mean
he's not possessed?

363
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.125
The fact that he can read
from the Bible just seals it.

364
00:26:30.208 --> 00:26:32.291
So. what does this mean.
then...

365
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.875
I'm just crazy?

366
00:26:36.291 --> 00:26:39.166
Well... you're not possessed.

367
00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:43.541
But that doesn't mean
that you weren't.

368
00:26:44.625 --> 00:26:48.333
I... invited this
thing into me.

369
00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:50.458
and that's the reason
that he's dead.

370
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.208
So. you know.
whatever happens to me.

371
00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:56.833
I've got it coming.

372
00:26:56.916 --> 00:26:58.250
No. you don't.

373
00:27:00.416 --> 00:27:01.416
Look...

374
00:27:03.291 --> 00:27:04.750
I was there.

375
00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:09.083
Whatever is going on...

376
00:27:09.166 --> 00:27:12.333
whatever happened that day...

377
00:27:15.291 --> 00:27:17.041
that was not Arne.

378
00:27:20.833 --> 00:27:24.708
We're going to help you
in every way that we can.

379
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.500
If the demon's gone.
what can you do now?

380
00:27:34.125 --> 00:27:35.416
Who's your lawyer?

381
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.541
He was found covered
in the victim's blood.

382
00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:40.958
The murder weapon
belongs to him and it's got
his fingerprints all over it.

383
00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:44.208
Nobody's disputing any of that.
Arne knows that he's going
to prison.

384
00:27:44.291 --> 00:27:47.541
All we're saying
is that there were
mitigating circumstances.

385
00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.125
Mitigating circumstances?

386
00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:53.166
Look. I don't think
he should get
the death sentence. either.

387
00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.333
But I am not going
before a grand jury

388
00:27:55.416 --> 00:27:57.875
and saying he was possessed
by demons.

389
00:27:57.958 --> 00:27:59.250
It's never been done.

390
00:27:59.333 --> 00:28:01.208
Yes it has! It's been done
twice in England.

391
00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:03.083
The Michael Taylor case
was just a few years ago.

392
00:28:03.166 --> 00:28:06.708
Let me rephrase that.
It's never been done
successfully.

393
00:28:06.791 --> 00:28:08.625
Then let us help you.

394
00:28:08.708 --> 00:28:12.708
Ed and I have proven
the existence of the demonic
hundreds of times.

395
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:16.125
You've proven it to the church.
This is a court of law.

396
00:28:16.208 --> 00:28:17.916
The standards of evidence
are completely different.

397
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.750
The courts accepts
the existence of God

398
00:28:19.833 --> 00:28:22.750
every time a witness swears
to tell the truth.

399
00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:26.500
I think it's about time
they accept the existence
of the devil.

400
00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:32.208
How are you going
to convince a jury

401
00:28:32.291 --> 00:28:34.916
if you can't even convince me?

402
00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:40.791
I'll tell you what.
You come over to our house
for dinner.

403
00:28:40.875 --> 00:28:44.291
We'll show you the evidence
we've collected over the years.

404
00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:46.000
Introduce you to Annabelle.

405
00:28:46.083 --> 00:28:49.125
If you're not convinced.
we'll butt out.

406
00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:51.250
Deal?

407
00:28:53.416 --> 00:28:57.125
All right.
Show me what you got.

408
00:28:57.208 --> 00:28:58.916
[gavel banging]

409
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.583
Mr. Johnson.
to count one of indictment
number S-A-J-1-2-1-6.

410
00:29:03.666 --> 00:29:05.708
which charges you with
first-degree murder.

411
00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:07.375
a class-A felony.

412
00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:09.083
how do you plead?

413
00:29:09.166 --> 00:29:11.750
Your Honor.
my client pleads not guilty

414
00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:14.375
by reason of
demonic possession.

415
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:30.833
[bell tolling]

416
00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:38.291
This is ridiculous.
I can walk down
a flight of stairs.

417
00:29:38.375 --> 00:29:40.666
Oh. hush. You shouldn't
even be out of bed.

418
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.375
Lorraine.

419
00:29:43.458 --> 00:29:47.166
I just talked
to a friend of mine
in the prosecutor's office.

420
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:49.625
He's gonna go for
the death penalty.

421
00:29:49.708 --> 00:29:53.666
I'll build the case.
but that kid is gonna
either live or die

422
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.000
depending on what you two find.

423
00:29:56.083 --> 00:29:57.750
Well. we won't let him down.

424
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.208
[lawyer] I hope not.

425
00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:01.666
Keep me posted.

426
00:30:06.458 --> 00:30:08.291
So. what now?

427
00:30:08.375 --> 00:30:11.541
We've never had to prove
a possession after the fact.

428
00:30:11.625 --> 00:30:14.250
Demons don't just
disappear like this.

429
00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:15.708
There's something else
going on here.

430
00:30:15.791 --> 00:30:17.875
something that we missed
the first time.

431
00:30:19.958 --> 00:30:21.500
Where do we start?

432
00:30:23.333 --> 00:30:24.916
At the beginning.

433
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:31.000
[Ed on tape]
<i>It's July 18th. 1981.</i>

434
00:30:31.083 --> 00:30:33.875
<i>This is Ed Warren.</i>
<i>here with Lorraine...</i>

435
00:30:33.958 --> 00:30:36.583
<i>and Judy Glatzel.</i>
<i>Deborah Glatzel.</i>

436
00:30:36.666 --> 00:30:39.708
<i>David Glatzel</i>
<i>and Arne Johnson.</i>

437
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:41.833
<i>All right. let's get started.</i>

438
00:30:41.916 --> 00:30:44.833
<i>Who was there</i>
<i>when David first started</i>
<i>exhibiting this behavior?</i>

439
00:30:44.916 --> 00:30:49.541
[Judy]<i> We all were.</i>
<i>It was the day we moved in.</i>

440
00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:51.333
There you go.
Go have fun with them.

441
00:30:53.125 --> 00:30:55.291
-Wanna order some pizza?
-[Debbie] Yeah sure.
I'll do that right now.

442
00:30:55.375 --> 00:30:57.041
-Hey.
-[Arne] Put that box down
a second.

443
00:30:57.125 --> 00:30:58.583
-[Debbie] Why?
-I just...

444
00:30:58.666 --> 00:30:59.750
What are you doing?

445
00:30:59.833 --> 00:31:02.166
-Have a look...
-What is... Arne!

446
00:31:05.333 --> 00:31:07.291
You know you're supposed
to do this when you
get married?

447
00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:09.375
Okay. so maybe
we'll do that too.

448
00:31:09.458 --> 00:31:10.500
[Debbie] Oh.

449
00:31:11.833 --> 00:31:12.958
[Debbie shrieks]

450
00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:43.875
[hinges creaking]

451
00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:22.708
[screaming]

452
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.541
No!

453
00:33:32.041 --> 00:33:33.125
Mom!

454
00:33:39.416 --> 00:33:41.125
[breath trembling]

455
00:33:51.166 --> 00:33:53.375
[David]<i> I didn't know</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

456
00:33:54.375 --> 00:33:57.083
<i>It was like a dream.</i>

457
00:33:57.166 --> 00:34:00.750
<i>And nobody believed me</i>
<i>when I told them.</i>

458
00:34:00.833 --> 00:34:03.708
<i>But that was the first time</i>
<i>I saw it.</i>

459
00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:20.000
I don't get it.

460
00:34:20.083 --> 00:34:22.541
How could he have invited
a demon? He was only in here
for a few minutes.

461
00:34:23.666 --> 00:34:25.583
There wasn't even anything
in here.

462
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.833
Where was the water bed?

463
00:34:30.125 --> 00:34:32.083
Where that rug is.

464
00:34:32.166 --> 00:34:34.625
The wood got damaged
when the mattress ruptured.

465
00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:39.875
-Mind if I have a look?
-Please.

466
00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:52.291
[gasps softly]

467
00:34:54.958 --> 00:34:56.791
That's not water damage.

468
00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:15.250
Hon. will you let me
handle this?

469
00:35:15.333 --> 00:35:17.875
You're going to ruin your dress
if you go in there.

470
00:35:19.916 --> 00:35:24.291
So. um. the guest room's
about 15 feet in
and to the right.

471
00:35:24.375 --> 00:35:25.833
Okay.

472
00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:29.125
-Just be careful.
-Just hold my purse.

473
00:35:59.041 --> 00:36:00.291
[rustling]

474
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.750
-[rat screeches]
-[screams]

475
00:36:10.833 --> 00:36:12.916
Lorraine! Are you all right?

476
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.625
Yeah. I'm fine. Ed.
It's just a rat.

477
00:36:15.708 --> 00:36:17.000
[sighs]

478
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:52.750
[rats squeaking]

479
00:37:56.916 --> 00:37:59.583
[praying in Latin]

480
00:38:12.291 --> 00:38:13.833
[Lorraine]
It's a witch's totem.

481
00:38:13.916 --> 00:38:16.500
used by Satanists
in their rituals.

482
00:38:16.583 --> 00:38:19.958
Remember how I told you
that an inhuman spirit
needs to be invited?

483
00:38:20.041 --> 00:38:22.791
And you couldn't imagine
how David could do that?

484
00:38:23.916 --> 00:38:26.541
Well. you were right.
he didn't.

485
00:38:30.291 --> 00:38:32.541
We think David was cursed.

486
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:35.916
And on the night
of the exorcism.

487
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.375
the curse was passed
from David into Arne.

488
00:38:39.458 --> 00:38:41.041
Cursed?

489
00:38:41.125 --> 00:38:45.750
Are you saying someone
did this to us... on purpose?

490
00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:48.750
We've heard of
satanic rituals like this.

491
00:38:48.833 --> 00:38:50.458
The demon is summoned.

492
00:38:50.541 --> 00:38:53.000
the possessed individual
takes a life
and the demon departs.

493
00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:56.208
Which is why Arne
was able to read
from the Bible afterwards.

494
00:38:56.291 --> 00:39:02.083
Yeah. We think whoever
cursed David. used this
to draw the demon.

495
00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:03.875
And we'd like you to start
mailing these out

496
00:39:03.958 --> 00:39:06.041
to every police department
you can find.

497
00:39:06.125 --> 00:39:07.708
Start locally.

498
00:39:07.791 --> 00:39:11.416
And. just find out if they've
ever seen anything like this.

499
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:15.791
There might be someone else
we can ask about this.

500
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.166
Do you remember the priest

501
00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:20.750
who helped expose the
Disciples of the Ram cult?

502
00:39:20.833 --> 00:39:22.916
It would've been about
10 or 12 years ago--

503
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.666
-Father Kastner?
-Yeah. you're right.

504
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:28.250
Only it isn't "Father" anymore.
he's been retired for a while.

505
00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:30.583
He tried to help those people.

506
00:39:30.666 --> 00:39:33.958
He tried to understand
why they did what they did.

507
00:39:34.041 --> 00:39:39.708
If anyone is going to be able
to tell us what this is.
it's him.

508
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:05.916
[Ed] Father Kastner.

509
00:40:12.625 --> 00:40:14.791
I didn't hear the car drive in.

510
00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:19.791
Would either of you care
for an omelet?

511
00:40:19.875 --> 00:40:22.625
We had breakfast before
we left home.

512
00:40:22.708 --> 00:40:25.291
I'm Ed Warren.
this is my wife Lorraine.

513
00:40:29.416 --> 00:40:31.666
I have chicken shit
on my hands.

514
00:40:37.625 --> 00:40:38.916
[both chuckle]

515
00:40:39.875 --> 00:40:40.875
[Lorraine] Thank you.

516
00:40:48.166 --> 00:40:50.125
Forget you ever saw this.

517
00:40:50.208 --> 00:40:52.500
You've seen it before?

518
00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:55.833
No. But I've seen ones like it.

519
00:40:55.916 --> 00:41:01.000
This is sophisticated.
It's a very nasty piece

00:55:22.666 --> 00:55:25.875
It's dumb. but.
I thought this was cool.

692
00:55:25.958 --> 00:55:28.875
It reminded me of the ones
we made in high school.

693
00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:31.666
Will you help me put it on?

694
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:32.916
Sure.

695
00:55:38.083 --> 00:55:39.458

[sobbing]

698
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.166
All right. that's enough.

699
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:35.416
Hon. that's enough.
That's enough! Come on!

700
00:56:39.291 --> 00:56:42.125
[breathing heavily]

701
00:56:42.208 --> 00:56:46.708
Katie? Katie? Oh. my God.
What did I do?

702
00:56:46.791 --> 00:56:47.791
Hon. no!

703
00:56:50.333 --> 00:56:51.458
Lorraine!

704
00:56:52.291 --> 00:56:53.375
[sobbing]

705
00:57:05.416 --> 00:57:06.708
[panting]

706
00:57:23.916 --> 00:57:25.250
[Ed] Lorraine!

707
00:57:30.166 --> 00:57:31.333
Lorraine.

708
00:57:35.541 --> 00:57:36.583
Ed.

709
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:39.125
[screaming]

710
00:57:39.208 --> 00:57:40.250
No!

711
00:57:51.875 --> 00:57:52.916
[grunting]

712
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:55.916
[both sigh]

713
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.041
It's okay. I got you.
I got you.

714
00:58:00.125 --> 00:58:02.041
[Lorraine panting]

715
00:58:07.916 --> 00:58:13.333
She's down there.
Ed. she's down there.

716
00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:24.416
[siren wailing]

717
00:58:25.916 --> 00:58:27.791
[paramedic]<i> Blood pressure's</i>
<i>a little high.</i>

718
00:58:27.875 --> 00:58:29.500
I'm gonna give you
a vasodilator.

719
00:58:29.583 --> 00:58:31.916
It's a pill. you're gonna
put it under your tongue.

720
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.791
It'll open up
your blood vessels.

721
00:58:33.875 --> 00:58:35.708
Yeah. I have those.

722
00:58:36.666 --> 00:58:38.666
I left them at home.

723
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:41.750
[paramedic] Yeah. well.
I wouldn't do that
anymore if I were you.

724
00:58:43.166 --> 00:58:44.708
Mind giving us a minute?

725
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.250
Recovery team found a body.

726
00:58:54.458 --> 00:58:57.083
-Is it--
-We're not sure.

727
00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:59.041
Look. I know what
it looks like.

728
00:58:59.125 --> 00:59:01.375
But. I don't want any of this
getting out until we have
a positive ID

729
00:59:01.458 --> 00:59:03.083
from the coroner.

730
00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:07.166
You know. we dragged
this basin. Twice.

731
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.333
Had to pull teeth
to get it done
a third time.

732
00:59:09.416 --> 00:59:11.375
We never would've done it
if it weren't for you.

733
00:59:12.666 --> 00:59:14.625
I'm just glad we could help.

734
00:59:14.708 --> 00:59:16.291
Let me know where
you're staying.

735
00:59:16.375 --> 00:59:18.666
And I'll get that casefile
to you in the morning.

736
00:59:26.958 --> 00:59:28.500
[phone ringing]

737
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:35.291
Hello?

738
00:59:35.375 --> 00:59:36.875
Oh. my God. I've been leaving
messages all day.

739
00:59:36.958 --> 00:59:39.666
-What's wrong?
<i>-It's Arne. It followed him!</i>

740
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:41.583
You said this was over.

741
00:59:41.666 --> 00:59:43.333
but now he's trapped in there
with this thing
and it's telling him

742
00:59:43.416 --> 00:59:45.416
-<i> to kill himself!</i>
<i>-</i> Debbie.

743
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.375
Just calm down and listen
to me. I need you to call
the prison chaplain. um...

744
00:59:48.458 --> 00:59:51.125
-Father Newman.
-Father Newman.
Tell him that

745
00:59:51.208 --> 00:59:54.666
<i>Arne needs to be put on</i>
<i>a 24-hour suicide watch!</i>
<i>He's got--</i>

[static screech]

747
00:59:57.041 --> 00:59:58.666
What? Hello?

748
01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:02.208
What is this thing?

749
01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:04.000
[thunderclap]

750
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:07.250

[lock clicking]

753
01:00:39.458 --> 01:00:40.750
[man] Arne.

754
01:00:42.625 --> 01:00:46.125
God gives everyone the right
to defend themselves.

755
01:00:51.041 --> 01:00:52.125
[lock clicks]

756
01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:08.041
[Lorraine] This demon...

757
01:01:08.125 --> 01:01:12.750
it's not here of its own
free will. It was summoned.

758
01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:14.458
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

759
01:01:14.541 --> 01:01:18.208
That means. we know that this
is a curse.

760
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:20.166
and curses can be broken.

761
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.250
All right.
Then. how do we do that?

762
01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:33.916
Back at the Glatzel house.

763
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.750
I touched David's hand
and I saw something.

764
01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:41.416
I didn't know what it was then.

765
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:45.875
But I think that I was
connected to the person
who is responsible for this.

766
01:01:46.958 --> 01:01:49.708
Ed. that body they found...

767
01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:53.791
if it's Jessica.
if it's really her.

768
01:01:53.875 --> 01:01:56.916
then that connection
could still be open.

769
01:02:01.458 --> 01:02:03.583
There's gotta be another way.

770
01:02:28.375 --> 01:02:29.625
[gasping]

771
01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.625
Okay... okay.

772
01:02:40.583 --> 01:02:42.000
Okay.

773
01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.500
<i>The Lord is my shepherd.</i>

774
01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:04.500
there is nothing I shall want.

775
01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:08.750
He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures...

776
01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:15.083

[rattling]

778
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:26.916
There's nobody there.

779
01:03:38.416 --> 01:03:40.208
We'll leave a note.

780
01:03:43.958 --> 01:03:45.250

Oh. boy.

784
01:05:18.416 --> 01:05:19.750
Please be careful.

787
01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:55.041
Do you see anything?

788
01:05:58.916 --> 01:06:01.750
No. There's nothing.

789
01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:05.916
There's nothing here.

790
01:06:07.958 --> 01:06:09.958
I'm not sensing it.

791
01:06:21.333 --> 01:06:23.750
-Lorraine. what is it?
-The connection.

792
01:06:27.666 --> 01:06:29.041
It's here.

793
01:07:17.583 --> 01:07:19.125
[train horn blowing]

794
01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:25.791

[Ed]<i> Do you see anything?</i>

Yes.

797
01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:40.666
Yes. there are... some stairs.

798
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:43.500
I heard a train.

799
01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:46.541
<i>But now...</i>

800
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.625
there's an altar.

801
01:07:52.541 --> 01:07:54.166
All those black candles.

802
01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:59.250
<i>There's 12 of them.</i>
<i>In a circle.</i>

803
01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:00.375
Oh. Ed.

804
01:08:00.458 --> 01:08:01.875
Okay. that's enough.
come back.

805
01:08:01.958 --> 01:08:03.250
I can't.

806
01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:05.291
Lorraine.

[switch ticking]

808
01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:11.625
It's a woman.

809
01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:14.041
[Ed]<i> Can you see her?</i>

810
01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:17.125
[Lorraine]<i> I am her.</i>

811
01:08:18.166 --> 01:08:20.125
Can you tell where she is?

812
01:08:21.083 --> 01:08:23.625
I don't know. I...

813
01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:24.916

814
01:08:26.208 --> 01:08:27.708
<i>She's doing it again.</i>

<i>She's reaching out to Arne.</i>

<i>Oh. no. no.</i>

820
01:09:03.833 --> 01:09:06.125
No. no. Oh. God.

821
01:09:06.208 --> 01:09:08.375
End this black sabbath.

822
01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:12.791
By the blood of Calvary
I command it!

823
01:09:22.208 --> 01:09:24.875
I got a cutter! C-19!

824
01:09:24.958 --> 01:09:26.250
Come on. kid.

826
01:09:39.416 --> 01:09:41.250
How are you doing this?

827
01:09:42.083 --> 01:09:44.125
God has shown you to me.

828
01:09:45.208 --> 01:09:48.166
Then your God has damned you.

829
01:09:51.833 --> 01:09:55.625
Ed. The connection
works both ways.

01:10:44.625 --> 01:10:46.625

Lorraine?

836
01:11:04.916 --> 01:11:07.291
You need to break
the connection.

837
01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:09.625
Drop her hand.

838
01:11:10.583 --> 01:11:13.166
Lorraine. let go of her hand.

Ed...

844
01:11:37.958 --> 01:11:39.833
She knows who we are.

01:11:48.041 --> 01:11:49.541
[sighs in relief]

847
01:11:49.625 --> 01:11:51.416
[Lorraine] We are so sorry.

848
01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.041
[crying]

849
01:11:53.125 --> 01:11:55.500
Oh. we're so sorry.

850
01:11:55.583 --> 01:11:56.875
How's Arne?

851
01:11:56.958 --> 01:11:59.708
He'll be all right.
They got him sedated.

852
01:11:59.791 --> 01:12:01.666
We got the casefile.

853
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:04.583
There's got to be something
here that connects these girls
back to him.

854
01:12:04.666 --> 01:12:05.958
That's great.

855
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.291
I got something
to show you. too.

856
01:12:12.166 --> 01:12:15.250
I found it in the Stregheria.
It's early Renaissance.

857
01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:19.458
The Church used it to identify
and persecute witchcraft.

858
01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.416
Now...

859
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:27.125
my Latin is rusty. but...
I think this...

860
01:12:27.208 --> 01:12:29.833
is talking about
a human sacrifice.

861
01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.458
One by murder
and the other by suicide.

862
01:12:34.541 --> 01:12:36.500
Does it say how to stop it?

863
01:12:37.583 --> 01:12:39.375
Yeah. it looks like...

864
01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:42.125
you can break the curse
by destroying the altar
it was cast from.

865
01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:43.916
But...

866
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.333
this part looks like Aramaic.

867
01:12:47.916 --> 01:12:50.750
This next part.
I can't read it.

868
01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:53.916
But you stopped her.
Maybe she'll give up now.

869
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.250
She can't.

870
01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:57.750
Once started. the curse
must be completed.

871
01:12:57.833 --> 01:12:59.500
Her soul depends on it.

872
01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:03.291
We'll find another way.

873
01:13:04.541 --> 01:13:05.916
Was there anything
in your vision

874
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.875
that might help us
find her altar?

875
01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:13.166
It was cold.

876
01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:20.208
There was water dripping
from the ceiling.

877
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:23.666
I think I heard a train.

878
01:13:25.708 --> 01:13:29.625
But it sounded strange somehow.
Like. um...

879
01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:33.166
I don't know. muffled?

880
01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:35.541
Well. maybe it was underground.

881
01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:38.500
Could be. I don't know where.

882
01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:42.208
This woman targeted
David and Jessica.

883
01:13:42.291 --> 01:13:43.458
Maybe there's
a connection there.

884
01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:44.458
Let me take a look at the...

885
01:13:44.541 --> 01:13:45.958
<i>Take a look at the...</i>

886
01:13:47.583 --> 01:13:48.791
<i>file.</i>

887
01:13:50.416 --> 01:13:51.958
[thunder rumbling]

888
01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:06.833
[groans softy]

889
01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:23.500
Lorraine?

890
01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:50.666
[leaves rustling]

891
01:15:13.166 --> 01:15:14.291
Lorraine?

892
01:15:23.583 --> 01:15:25.000
Lorraine!

893
01:15:25.083 --> 01:15:27.375
[breathing heavily]

894
01:15:42.666 --> 01:15:43.833
[indistinct clatter]

895
01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:51.708
[breathing heavily]

896
01:15:54.041 --> 01:15:56.333
Where is she?

897
01:15:56.416 --> 01:16:00.375
You know. the two of you have
gathered quite the collection.

898
01:16:02.875 --> 01:16:04.458
If you hurt her...

899
01:16:06.375 --> 01:16:09.416
Oh. don't worry. Mr. Warren.

900
01:16:10.041 --> 01:16:12.041
You're so close.

901
01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:17.250
I'd hate for you
to give up now.

902
01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:20.208
[loud thud]

903
01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:24.666
[thudding]

904
01:16:30.458 --> 01:16:32.500
[door creaking]

905
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.750
[growls]

906
01:16:51.458 --> 01:16:56.041
-[roars]
-He who calls forth
the water of the sea!

907
01:16:56.125 --> 01:16:58.333
The Lord of Hosts is His name!

908
01:16:58.416 --> 01:16:59.666
Deliver Thy servant

909
01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:03.166
from all the workings
of unclean spirits!

910
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:06.000
Fear and flee. unclean spirit!

911
01:17:06.083 --> 01:17:09.541
-Ed!
-[breathing heavily]

912
01:17:12.708 --> 01:17:13.833
Ed.

913
01:17:14.541 --> 01:17:15.833
I'm sorry.

914
01:17:16.583 --> 01:17:18.500
Ed. it was her!

915
01:17:19.458 --> 01:17:20.791
It was her.

916
01:17:23.166 --> 01:17:25.958
-[Drew] Ed.
what the hell is going on?
-Help me find it!

917
01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.291
Find what?

918
01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.375
[Ed] Where is it?

919
01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:34.458
[Drew] Ed.

920
01:17:36.208 --> 01:17:37.333
Ed!

921
01:17:37.416 --> 01:17:40.958
She was here!
She was in our house!

922
01:18:04.708 --> 01:18:06.291
When did these get here?

923
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.291
They just arrived yesterday

924
01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:14.000
while you guys
were driving home.

925
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:18.791
They were fresh
when they got here.

926
01:18:47.166 --> 01:18:48.166
[gasps]

927
01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:54.958
[sighs]

928
01:19:04.541 --> 01:19:06.583
[Lorraine] We have
to find this woman.

929
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.250
We've identified the curse

930
01:19:09.333 --> 01:19:10.791
and now we have
Jessica's casefile.

931
01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:13.000
There has to be
something in here.

932
01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:16.666
Okay. I'm gonna take the book
to be translated.

933
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:19.666
There has to be a clue
about where we can
find the altar.

934
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:21.041
[Debbie] So what do we do?

935
01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:22.833
You should go be with Arne.

936
01:19:22.916 --> 01:19:25.541
He's gonna need you tonight
more than ever.

937
01:19:25.625 --> 01:19:27.750
Ask Father Newman for help.

938
01:19:29.583 --> 01:19:32.708
Drew. you and me are gonna
tear into those files.

939
01:19:32.791 --> 01:19:35.000
We've got to find a link
between these cases.

940
01:19:35.083 --> 01:19:38.583
And a Satanist's power
is strongest at night. So...

941
01:19:38.666 --> 01:19:41.583
Let's hope she doesn't
try anything before then.

942
01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:01.166
They've stopped his sedation.

943
01:20:02.958 --> 01:20:04.708
He'll be coming around soon.

944
01:20:21.291 --> 01:20:23.125
[Drew] There's nothing
in these interviews.

945
01:20:23.208 --> 01:20:27.375
Her friends barely saw her
after she got back
from college.

946
01:20:27.458 --> 01:20:29.041
Didn't that
seem strange to you?

947
01:20:29.125 --> 01:20:30.500
I mean. we're here.

948
01:20:30.583 --> 01:20:32.458
the Glatzels live here.
just 15 minutes away.

949
01:20:32.541 --> 01:20:35.500
But Jessica lived
180 miles from here.

950
01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:39.541
Why is this one so far away?

951
01:20:42.458 --> 01:20:44.583
Hey. where did Jessica
find her totem?

952
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.500
I just saw something
about that.

953
01:20:48.583 --> 01:20:50.500
It was in an interview
with her parents.

954
01:20:50.583 --> 01:20:52.250
It was in a box.

955
01:20:52.333 --> 01:20:54.875
"She brought it back home
in a box from college."

956
01:20:56.166 --> 01:20:57.875
Where'd she go to college?

957
01:21:01.333 --> 01:21:02.291
Fairfield.

958
01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:19.291
This woman lives in the area.

959
01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.458
Still a lot of ground to cover.

960
01:21:22.708 --> 01:21:25.250
Yeah. but not
a lot of train tracks.

961
01:21:25.333 --> 01:21:27.666
Remember Lorraine's vision?
She said she heard a train.

962
01:21:29.125 --> 01:21:30.416
What time was it?

963
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.458
Maybe we can start
eliminating some of these.

964
01:21:32.541 --> 01:21:34.083
[Ed] Probably
close to midnight.

965
01:21:34.166 --> 01:21:35.958
[Drew] Then it can't be
either of these two.

966
01:21:36.041 --> 01:21:37.833
The commuter lines
don't run that late.

967
01:21:37.916 --> 01:21:39.458
That just leaves
this freight line

968
01:21:39.541 --> 01:21:40.791
that crosses the river here.

969
01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:44.166
The river.

970
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.708
Oh. dear God.

971
01:21:56.125 --> 01:21:57.208
Mrs. Warren.

972
01:21:57.291 --> 01:21:58.791
I'm sorry. Father.
we tried calling.

973
01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:00.708
but we couldn't reach you.

974
01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:04.250
We were hoping you'd help us
translate a passage
from this book.

975
01:22:07.416 --> 01:22:09.583
Of course. Come in.

976
01:22:10.208 --> 01:22:11.333
Thank you.

977
01:22:19.791 --> 01:22:22.708
Give me your keys.
You stay here. call the police.

978
01:22:22.791 --> 01:22:24.000
[Drew] What do you want me
to tell them?

979
01:22:24.083 --> 01:22:25.833
Anything.
just get 'em out there!

980
01:22:25.916 --> 01:22:26.958
[door shuts]

981
01:22:33.375 --> 01:22:35.416
[Kastner] It's the curse.

982
01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:40.750
It says. the curse needs three
victims to be complete.

983
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.958
It refers to them as...

984
01:22:45.041 --> 01:22:48.833
"The child. the lover
and the man of God."

985
01:22:49.833 --> 01:22:52.500
The embodiment of God's work.

986
01:22:53.333 --> 01:22:57.666
Purity. love. faith.

987
01:23:00.583 --> 01:23:02.041
Has there been another?

988
01:23:06.375 --> 01:23:08.833
It's Ed. It's my husband.

989
01:23:11.875 --> 01:23:14.791
Last night we found a totem
in his office.

990
01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:19.583
That is unfortunate.

991
01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:26.916
Here. come with me.

992
01:23:28.916 --> 01:23:31.083
There's something
I need to show you.

993
01:23:50.041 --> 01:23:51.458
[floorboard creaking]

994
01:23:54.916 --> 01:23:56.083
Father?

995
01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:59.791
I've been here many years...

996
01:25:01.583 --> 01:25:03.750
starting when I was a priest.

997
01:25:06.250 --> 01:25:10.166
The church
used this mill for storage.

998
01:25:12.083 --> 01:25:15.875
It's where they put the things
that they were afraid of.

999
01:25:17.041 --> 01:25:19.208
Things they didn't understand.

1000
01:25:35.791 --> 01:25:37.416
You had a child?

1001
01:25:40.291 --> 01:25:42.708
Her mother died in childbirth.

1002
01:25:44.583 --> 01:25:47.250
The Church couldn't know.

1003
01:25:47.333 --> 01:25:51.041
So I raised her here.
in secret.

1004
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:55.666
It was just the two of us.

1005
01:25:57.625 --> 01:26:01.666
Our happiness
filled this house.

1006
01:26:04.541 --> 01:26:08.125
I continued my studies
into the occult.

1007
01:26:08.208 --> 01:26:10.625
I wanted to protect her
from all this.

1008
01:26:14.416 --> 01:26:18.125
Instead I created
a fascination.

1009
01:26:22.166 --> 01:26:25.083
We must be careful

1010
01:26:25.166 --> 01:26:28.416
how our obsessions are passed
to our children.

1011
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.833
"He who dwells in the shelter
of the most high

1012
01:26:35.916 --> 01:26:38.500
will rest in the shadow
of the Almighty.

1013
01:26:38.583 --> 01:26:40.458
I will say of the Lord.

1014
01:26:40.541 --> 01:26:44.166
'He is my refuge
and my fortress.

1015
01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:47.125
my God. in whom I trust.'"

1016
01:26:54.291 --> 01:26:56.541
It's just the wiring.

1017
01:26:56.625 --> 01:26:59.458
You know. state building.

1018
01:27:01.666 --> 01:27:03.000
[Arne] Debbie.

1019
01:27:03.666 --> 01:27:04.708
Arne.

1020
01:27:10.125 --> 01:27:11.458
What is it?

1021
01:27:12.833 --> 01:27:15.125
She's... she's close.

1022
01:27:27.166 --> 01:27:28.666
You knew?

1023
01:27:31.041 --> 01:27:34.625
We came to you for help
and you knew this whole time?

1024
01:27:38.083 --> 01:27:40.000
She's my daughter.

1025
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.041
I couldn't...

1026
01:27:46.083 --> 01:27:47.916
I didn't want to see.

1027
01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.666
After all these years.

1028
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:55.083
I thought she'd come back
to me again.

1029
01:27:57.250 --> 01:28:00.750
And now I know
the real reason she's here.

1030
01:28:03.541 --> 01:28:07.333
There are tunnels
under this land.

1031
01:28:07.416 --> 01:28:10.958
She would explore them
as a child.

1032
01:28:13.416 --> 01:28:16.333
Her altar must be down there.

1033
01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:20.291
It's the only thing
that can break her curse.

1034
01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:25.041
We need to destroy it.

1035
01:28:25.125 --> 01:28:27.458
[door creaking]

1036
01:28:31.416 --> 01:28:32.958
She's here.

1037
01:28:44.916 --> 01:28:45.875
[Kastner] Go.

1038
01:29:27.083 --> 01:29:29.291
I failed as a priest.

1039
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:33.416
And I failed as a father.

1040
01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.958
Please. God.
don't let me fail--

1041
01:29:49.916 --> 01:29:52.083
[breathing heavily]

1042
01:31:03.375 --> 01:31:05.000
[grunts]

1043
01:31:14.125 --> 01:31:15.708
[breathing heavily]

1044
01:31:15.791 --> 01:31:17.458
[footsteps approaching]

1045
01:31:50.583 --> 01:31:52.375
[Ed] Lorraine!

1046
01:31:52.458 --> 01:31:53.625
Lorraine!

1047
01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:55.208
[Lorraine in the distance] Ed!

1048
01:31:56.166 --> 01:31:57.333
Lorraine!

1049
01:31:58.291 --> 01:31:59.375
Lorraine!

1050
