Ma'am? Ma'am. can you hear me?

5
00:00:06.708 --> 00:00:08.125
Is she on medication?

Heart rate is dropping.

You need to make a decision.

26
00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:35.917
What's Biosurgix
currently trading?

27
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.167
93.

28
00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:38.500
That's a 50% premium.

29
00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:39.583
That comes to what?

30
00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.000
Enough to require
board approval.

31
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.250
So reach out. call him.

32
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.458
[Jackson] I can't.

33
00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.208
Tranquilify is yesterday's news.

-It's time to level up.
-They don't care. Shane.

35
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.542
-What do they care about?
-Profits.

36
00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:53.833
Okay. We're one of the largest
pharmaceutical companies

37
00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:55.458
in the world.

38
00:01:55.542 --> 00:01:57.125
We are in the business
of helping people.

39
00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:59.500
No. We are in the business
of making money.

40
00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:01.750
Helping people is just
a convenient side effect.

41
00:02:08.083 --> 00:02:09.500
Where's the data
from the latest trials?

42
00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:11.500

-Well. go get it.

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:21.458
The world is playing chess while
my brother is playing checkers.

47
00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:23.375
-Is that our official comment?
-[Olivia] Our official comment

48
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.667
is we have no official comment.
Next.

The dedication ceremony.

The hospital wants to issue
the press release.

-Confirmed?
-Governor Barnholton

52
00:02:30.375 --> 00:02:32.125
and Senator
Shenck. Mayor Nolan.

53
00:02:32.208 --> 00:02:34.042
-Representative Best?
-Sent his regrets.

54
00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:36.542
However. Congressman Casey
is a strong maybe.

55
00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:39.292
Wouldn't be a bad idea to get
a couple of younger faces. too?

56
00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:40.792
-Hmm.
-[Olivia] Maybe an influencer

57
00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:41.833
who recovered after taking one

58
00:02:41.917 --> 00:02:42.833
of our medications.

59
00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.208
Already on it.

60
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.625
-Hello?
-[Tyler] Olivia. it's Tyler.

61
00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:49.500
You better come down
to the conference room.

62
00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:51.000
Your brother is about to go
to the board.

63
00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:52.458
[Jackson]
The COO is on our side.

64
00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:54.292
It's the old man
you need to worry about.

65
00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:55.500
Well. the old man needs
to take the money

66
00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:57.167
and retire on a tropical island.

67
00:02:57.208 --> 00:02:58.125
Hell. with the money
I'm offering.

68
00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.500
he could buy the island.

69
00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:01.208
-That's what I told him.
-[Shane] And he said?

70
00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:02.708
[Jackson] Retirement is not
in his vocabulary.

71
00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:03.875
[Shane] Buy him a dictionary.

72
00:03:05.042 --> 00:03:07.250
[Olivia] Please.
don't stop on my account.

73
00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:09.792
Can I have the room?

74
00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:17.625
Be nice.

75
00:03:22.458 --> 00:03:23.667
[Shane] Have you tried
one of those?

76
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.167
They're delicious.

77
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.833
You know you're supposed
to consult with me first.

78
00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:28.375
Says who? CEO?

79
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500
[scoffs] Oh. wait. I forgot.
That's me.

80
00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:32.625
Biosurgix isn't interested.

81
00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:34.833
Is that why they call it
a hostile takeover?

82
00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:36.875
And what's this about
you speaking to the Journal?

83
00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:38.333
You read what they wrote
about Dad.

84
00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:40.042
[Olivia] it's an outrage
and our legal team

85
00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:41.917
is already drafting
an appropriate response.

86
00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:43.542
In which time.
millions of subscribers

87
00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.167
are gonna formulate an opinion.

88
00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:46.500
I'm just trying to get him
the respect he deserves.

89
00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:48.167
Which is why
I wish you'd reconsider

90
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.500
the hostile takeover
because he never would've done--

91
00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:52.500
Would've approved. Yes. I know.

92
00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:54.708
I know.
But the world is changing.

93
00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:56.667
Times are changing.
The industry is changing.

94
00:03:56.708 --> 00:03:58.500
which is forcing us
to make a choice.

95
00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:00.500
We're either gonna break
the mold and change with it.

96
00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:02.708
or I can go tell 1.500 people
why they're not gonna be able

97
00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:04.458
to afford Christmas presents
this year.

98
00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:05.458
What would you like?

99
00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:06.792
[Olivia] Look. I get it.

100
00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:07.875
Dad was bullheaded.

101
00:04:08.042 --> 00:04:09.208
stubborn. old-fashioned.

102
00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:10.875
-Don't forget superstitious.
-Right.

103
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.958
[Shane] And not one of those

104
00:04:12.042 --> 00:04:13.292
fortune-telling witch doctors

105
00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:15.333
-could save Mom.
-Yes. he was spiritual.

106
00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:16.833
Maybe too much so.

107
00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:18.167
but the one thing he never was

108
00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:19.208
was a bully.

109
00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:20.250
Not in the office

110
00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.375
and not in the market.

111
00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:23.500
So. before you break the mold.

112
00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:26.833
I urge you to please consider
whose mold you're breaking.

113
00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:30.208

[seagulls squawking]

121
00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:44.708
[Maya] Can I help you?

122
00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:48.292
Yeah.
Any of this stuff for real?

123
00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:51.917
Those are. The imaginary
merchandise is over there.

124
00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:52.958
Maya Priestley.

125
00:05:54.208 --> 00:05:55.292
Shane.

126
00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:56.958
Shane Settel.

127
00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:58.625
She's actually helping
to speak with Arabella.

128
00:05:58.708 --> 00:06:00.250
Ms. Prescott is in New York.

129
00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:01.667
One of our clients
is looking to make

130
00:06:01.708 --> 00:06:03.333
a real estate purchase
on Central Park.

131
00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:04.917
Oh. a nice apartment?

132
00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:06.042
Nice building.

133
00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:07.458
Maybe I could help.

134
00:06:07.542 --> 00:06:09.458
Uh. yeah.
Well. I got this email.

135
00:06:09.542 --> 00:06:11.958
said it was promising answers
and guidance.

136
00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:13.458
And you figured what the heck?

137
00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:14.833
Yeah. Something like that.

138
00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:15.875
This way.

139
00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:35.833
So. how do we begin?

140
00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:38.208
Well. first. you need
to have an open mind.

141
00:06:38.292 --> 00:06:40.500
Yeah. of course. I do. Sure.

142
00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:42.875
May I remind you
I'm an intuitive.

143
00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:46.708
Fine.

144
00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:49.542
I guess I'm not what you would
call a spiritual person.

145
00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:51.833
-But somebody close to you is.
-[Shane] Was.

146
00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:53.292
My father. Yeah.

147
00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:55.667
[Maya] You think
he was wasting his time?

148
00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:58.042
That did cross my mind
a few times. yeah.

149
00:06:58.125 --> 00:06:59.708
And yet you're here.

150
00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:03.542
Yeah.

151
00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:05.125
Yeah. well. you know.

152
00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:06.375
what if he was right?

153
00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:12.458
Tarot is just a tool.
Nothing more.

154
00:07:12.542 --> 00:07:14.417
My role is to interpret
the cards' symbolism

155
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.875
to gain insight.

156
00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:19.375
While the tarot cannot tell you
what will happen.

157
00:07:19.542 --> 00:07:21.792
it can offer guidance
on how to handle it.

158
00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:25.167
You ready?

159
00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:28.042
Sitting on the edge of my seat.

160
00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:33.833
Wait. Let me guess.
that one's me?

161
00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:35.167
A young person

162
00:07:35.292 --> 00:07:36.542
blissfully unaware
he's about to take

163
00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.500
-a dangerous step.
-Okay.

164
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.667
[Maya] His arms are open
to new opportunities.

165
00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:42.375
He's willing to take risks.

166
00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:44.333
There is a challenge in his life

167
00:07:44.417 --> 00:07:46.417
that he must confront
in order to progress.

168
00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:52.208
You see the woman

169
00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:54.458
fearlessly placing herself
in danger.

170
00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:56.667
and yet the lion
isn't threatened by her?

171
00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:58.542
This card is advising you
to approach the obstacles

172
00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.292
in your life with confidence.

173
00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:02.292
And you should tell that
to my sister.

174
00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:03.833
You believe she's the woman
on the card?

175
00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:06.542
I think she's the lion
on the card. yeah.

176
00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:08.083
Now. the next two cards
are intended

177
00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:09.667
to provide context.

178
00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:12.125
See?

179
00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:13.250
Note the people responding

180
00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:14.500
to the angel's call.

181
00:08:14.583 --> 00:08:16.500
It's an awakening.

182
00:08:16.542 --> 00:08:18.083
This means you're ready
for the important decision

183
00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:19.458
that lies ahead.

184
00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:20.542
It's time to put the past
behind us

185
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.417
-and embrace the future.
-Okay.

186
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.542
Now. you're speaking
my language.

187
00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:24.875
I like that.

188
00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:28.333
[Maya] This man is suspended
from the tree of life.

189
00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:30.667
He has found relaxation.
And as you can see

190
00:08:30.708 --> 00:08:31.792
from the illumination
surrounding his head.

191
00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:33.875
he has found enlightenment.

192
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.250
You already have everything
you need to make your decision.

193
00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:38.125
You just need
to trust your instincts.

194
00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:42.000
Now. your fears.

195
00:08:44.083 --> 00:08:46.625
The swords here indicate
there may be somebody

196
00:08:46.708 --> 00:08:48.875
close to you who doesn't agree
with your decisions.

197
00:08:50.708 --> 00:08:52.625
Go ask my sister. the lion.

198
00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:54.833
And yet you see
the juxtaposition

199
00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:56.667
between the night
and the sunrise?

200
00:08:56.708 --> 00:08:58.375
While the night is dark.

201
00:08:58.458 --> 00:09:00.750
the rising sun brings hope
and opportunity.

202
00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:05.000
Okay. And the last one?

203
00:09:05.042 --> 00:09:06.042
[Maya] Insight.

204
00:09:09.542 --> 00:09:11.625
[Shane] Death.

205
00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:13.292
What does that mean?
Does that mean I'm gonna die?

206
00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:14.417
No. no. no. no.

207
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.917
But it's not...

208
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.750
this isn't supposed
to happen this way.

209
00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:18.792
How's my intuition supposed
to guide me through death?

210
00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:20.292
From beyond the grave?

211
00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:21.333
My father was so full of--

212
00:09:21.417 --> 00:09:22.750
No. no. Wait. wait. wait.

213
00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:26.792
This is you.

214
00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:28.750
You have confronted
your obstacles.

215
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.417
You have found enlightenment.
and thus ready

216
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.833
to make your decision.

217
00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.708
Your turning point
is close at hand.

218
00:09:33.792 --> 00:09:35.750
Somehow through death.

219
00:09:35.833 --> 00:09:38.292
you and your company
will find rebirth.

220
00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:41.917
[tense music]

221
00:09:42.042 --> 00:09:43.750
[Jackson]
I don't know what you talked to
your sister about.

222
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:44.792
She's already called
a couple of the members

223
00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:46.167
of the board herself.

224
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.875
Hey. Jackson. put a pin in it.

225
00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.000
I don't wanna buy
Biosurgix stock anymore.

226
00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:53.250
Okay. Well. this morning.
you were all in on that.

227
00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:55.667
Just tell their CEO
that I'm prepared to pivot

228
00:09:55.792 --> 00:09:57.333
straight into an acquisition.

229
00:09:57.417 --> 00:10:00.500
[chuckles]
And what fantasy universe?

230
00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:02.292
Irving Polk will never go
for this.

231
00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:03.875
Just humor me. please.

232
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.917
[sighs]

233
00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:08.250
It's your funeral.

234
00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:09.583
Anything but that.

235
00:10:12.458 --> 00:10:15.583
[tense music]

236
00:10:19.292 --> 00:10:21.167
[crickets chirping]

237
00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:25.375
Hey. Grant. Shane.

238
00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.583
Dan the man.

239
00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:29.667
No. I'm never gonna stop
calling you that.

240
00:10:29.708 --> 00:10:31.667
I was just staring
at a bottle of single malt.

241
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:32.875
Just gonna crack it open.

242
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.625
Come on. We'll order pizza.

243
00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:36.208
We'll put on a movie
in the whole theater.

244
00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:37.667
What do you say?

245
00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:39.500
Oh. come on. You can break away
for a few drinks.

246
00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:42.542
No. No. after they go to bed.
of course.

247
00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:44.167
What? The office.

248
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.333
Well. how late are you staying
at the office?

249
00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:48.333
No. it's not that late.

250
00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:50.042
Can't you get away
for one night?

251
00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:52.333
The paperwork's not going
anywhere. brother. Come on.

252
00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:54.292
Yeah. She's not going mi...

253
00:10:55.917 --> 00:10:58.250
Yeah. No. I got it.
Happy wife. happy life.

254
00:10:58.333 --> 00:10:59.458
No. yeah. That's okay.

255
00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:00.750
Another time. brother.

256
00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:02.958
Yeah. Give her my best.

257
00:11:03.042 --> 00:11:04.333
I got you.

258
00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:06.333
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

259
00:11:06.458 --> 00:11:07.958
Okay. Night.

260
00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:13.250
[dramatic music]

261
00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:30.000
[reporter] And in local news.
Irving Polk.

262
00:11:30.042 --> 00:11:32.167
CEO of Medical
Technology Company.

263
00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:34.917
Biosurgix has rejected
numerous bids

264
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.708
from Settel Pharmaceuticals'
interim CEO. Shane Settel.

265
00:11:38.792 --> 00:11:40.625
And there are rumors
that the company might attempt

266
00:11:40.708 --> 00:11:42.833
a hostile takeover.

267
00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:45.917
Settel Pharmaceuticals known
for its strategic acquisitions

268
00:11:46.042 --> 00:11:48.125
and aggressive expansion
strategies

269
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.833
is said to be attracted
to Biosurgix...

270
00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:51.667
Over my dead body.

271
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.542
[reporter] ...development
pipeline. which includes

272
00:11:53.625 --> 00:11:55.083
promising advancements
in gene therapy...

273
00:11:55.208 --> 00:11:58.417
Peter. is that you?

274
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.458
[suspenseful music]

275
00:12:08.042 --> 00:12:09.042
[Irving] Hello?

276
00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:16.958
[tense music]

277
00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:37.000
[Irving screams]

278
00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:39.917
[body thuds]

279
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.083
[suspenseful music]

280
00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:54.958
[phone vibrating]

281
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:17.208
Yeah.

282
00:13:19.042 --> 00:13:21.000
[grunts] What did you say?

283
00:13:21.042 --> 00:13:22.875
[male reporter]
The medical technology industry

284
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.958
has lost one of its leaders
as CEO...

285
00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:26.875
[female reporter]
CEO Irving Polk was found dead

286
00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.542
last night in his home...

287
00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:29.875
[male reporter] The police
department have suggested Polk

288
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.625
had fallen down the stairs.

289
00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:33.000
[female reporter] Wall Street
is already speculating

290
00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:34.750
what Polk's death might mean

291
00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:36.667
in terms of a potential sale

292
00:13:36.708 --> 00:13:38.500
of his company Biosurgix.

293
00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.000
[Jackson] What the ancients call

294
00:13:40.083 --> 00:13:42.917
clever fighter is one
who not only wins.

295
00:13:43.042 --> 00:13:45.708
but excels at winning with ease.

296
00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:48.000
I doubt my brother
has read Sun Tzu.

297
00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:49.667
[Jackson] Well. lucky for him.
when the deal goes through.

298
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.375
he'll be able to afford a copy.

299
00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:53.375
-You talked to him?
-[Jackson] This morning.

300
00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:55.333
He said he needed to make a stop
on his way in.

301
00:13:55.458 --> 00:13:56.833
I don't wanna wait.

302
00:13:56.917 --> 00:13:58.708
Tell comms to start drafting
a statement.

303
00:13:58.833 --> 00:14:00.417
-Jonathan?
-Allison.

304
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.208
I want a ballet. not a brawl.

305
00:14:02.292 --> 00:14:05.000
-Already on it.
-When you told me my brother

306
00:14:05.083 --> 00:14:06.875
wanted to make an offer
to their COO.

307
00:14:06.958 --> 00:14:07.958
You thought he was insane.

308
00:14:08.042 --> 00:14:09.792
[Olivia] Do you agree?

309
00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:13.167
Uh. one man's insanity
is another man's audacity.

310
00:14:13.208 --> 00:14:14.208
Oh. dumb luck.

311
00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:16.667
-[sighs]
-I'd call it

312
00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:18.333
a serendipitous stumble.

313
00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:21.667
But I wouldn't have Allison
put that in her release.

314
00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:24.958
Do you think it's a good idea
to move so quickly?

315
00:14:25.042 --> 00:14:26.792
Your brother wants
his victory lap.

316
00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:28.500
I didn't ask about Shane.

317
00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:30.083
I asked about you.

318
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.000
I get where you're coming from.

319
00:14:33.125 --> 00:14:35.292
You've always been
compassionate. and sensitive.

320
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.958
and thoughtful ever since
you were about yay high.

321
00:14:38.917 --> 00:14:40.083
If you want my advice.

322
00:14:40.167 --> 00:14:41.375
you never know when the wind

323
00:14:41.458 --> 00:14:42.667
is gonna change direction.

324
00:14:42.792 --> 00:14:44.000
So we either strike

325
00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:46.125
while the door is open. or...

326
00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:48.833
we risk being left out
in the cold.

327
00:14:48.917 --> 00:14:51.000
[sighs]

328
00:14:51.042 --> 00:14:52.542
You're probably right.

329
00:14:52.667 --> 00:14:54.167
What we really should be asking

330
00:14:54.208 --> 00:14:56.875
is what leprechauns your brother
has been charming.

331
00:14:59.167 --> 00:15:00.083
Maya?

332
00:15:01.208 --> 00:15:03.375
Maya. I need to talk to you.

333
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.708
Mr. Settel. I didn't expect
to see you again so soon.

334
00:15:05.708 --> 00:15:07.458
How did you know?

335
00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:08.708
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

336
00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:10.000
[chuckles] Really?

337
00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.000
I thought
you were supposed to be

338
00:15:11.042 --> 00:15:12.500
some kind of an intuitive?

339
00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.000
-Why don't we come inside?
-No.

340
00:15:14.083 --> 00:15:15.167
Not until you tell me
how you knew

341
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.875
that Irving Polk was gonna die.

342
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.917
-I didn't.
-Yes. you did.

343
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.583
You sat there and you told me

344
00:15:20.667 --> 00:15:22.958
that through death somehow
that my company and I

345
00:15:23.042 --> 00:15:24.458
were gonna have
some kind of a rebirth.

346
00:15:24.542 --> 00:15:26.042
I also said that the cards

347
00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:27.833
don't tell you
what's going to happen.

348
00:15:27.917 --> 00:15:29.500
They only offer guidance.

349
00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:32.417
-Okay.
-[Maya] Put it this way.

350
00:15:32.542 --> 00:15:34.167
If you ask me
for tomorrow's lottery winners.

351
00:15:34.208 --> 00:15:35.833
I would have no idea.

352
00:15:35.917 --> 00:15:37.125
I'm not a fortune teller.

353
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.083
Okay. So it... so it's just
by some coincidence

354
00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:47.667
that the one person
holding me back

355
00:15:47.792 --> 00:15:49.500
from the biggest deal
of my career

356
00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:52.000
just happens to fall down
a flight of stairs?

357
00:15:52.042 --> 00:15:54.083
Do you still believe your father
was wasting his time?

358
00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:56.083
Did you want me to believe
in this hocus pocus?

359
00:15:56.167 --> 00:15:58.542
If so. you're gonna have
to tell me how you knew.

360
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.000
I didn't. The cards did.

361
00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:04.458
Whether or not you choose
to believe it. that's up to you.

362
00:16:06.875 --> 00:16:09.833
[siren wailing in a distance]

363
00:16:09.917 --> 00:16:11.667
Everyone. stand. Come on.

364
00:16:14.458 --> 00:16:15.875
To Biosurgix.

365
00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:17.667
Uh-uh-uh.
it's not Biosurgix anymore.

366
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.000
You're right. You're right.

367
00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:21.042
To Settel Pharmaceuticals.

368
00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:22.667
onward and upward.

369
00:16:22.708 --> 00:16:23.667
-Hear. hear.
-[glasses clinking]

370
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.000
[Shane] Cheers.

371
00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:29.417
You know. I was thinking.

372
00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.833
we should have included
some of those

373
00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:32.708
former Biosurgix peeps.

374
00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:35.333
Their stock just rose 25%.
They're doing just fine.

375
00:16:35.417 --> 00:16:37.542
They're burying their boss.
not celebrating.

376
00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:40.083
Well. I heard the man
wasn't exactly venerated.

377
00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:42.750
By whom? His coworkers
or his seven grandchildren?

378
00:16:42.833 --> 00:16:44.375
Ouch. That hurt.

379
00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:46.167
You two should read the papers
once in a while.

380
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.833
-You might learn something.
-[Jackson] Okay.

381
00:16:47.917 --> 00:16:50.958
I need a refill.

382
00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:54.042
You know. obviously.

383
00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:55.542
what happened to Irving.
it's a tragedy.

384
00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:57.292
And I wish it
would've happened differently.

385
00:16:57.375 --> 00:16:59.917
This is a monumental step
for our company.

386
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.750
So. why don't you
just enjoy the moment?

387
00:17:02.833 --> 00:17:04.375
I'll use the bathroom.

388
00:17:08.542 --> 00:17:09.708
[gasps]

389
00:17:09.708 --> 00:17:11.125
I'm so sorry.

390
00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:13.208
Honestly. it is
the perfect ending

391
00:17:13.292 --> 00:17:14.750
to the perfect evening.

392
00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:16.583
Well. even with me
bumping into you.

393
00:17:16.583 --> 00:17:19.125
I doubt a woman like you is
capable of having a bad night.

394
00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:20.417
I would've doubted
a man like you

395
00:17:20.417 --> 00:17:21.875
would even have a handkerchief.

396
00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.208
Touché.

397
00:17:24.333 --> 00:17:26.458
It's okay. though.
I have dry cleaning.

398
00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:28.292
So. I'll be okay.

399
00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:29.917
Well. that takes
care of the dress.

400
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.167
What about your drink?

401
00:17:31.167 --> 00:17:32.500
Honestly. it's okay.

402
00:17:32.583 --> 00:17:34.250
It was pretty
depressing drinking alone.

403
00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:36.000
Excuse me?

404
00:17:36.083 --> 00:17:38.500
I was on a blind date.
but I got stood up.

405
00:17:38.542 --> 00:17:41.292
He must have really been blind
to have stood you up.

406
00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:43.708
[chuckles]

407
00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:45.667
I'm Shane. Shane Settel.

408
00:17:47.208 --> 00:17:48.958
Natalie King.

409
00:17:49.042 --> 00:17:51.333
So. what were you drinking.
Natalie King?

410
00:17:51.417 --> 00:17:53.667
Gin and tonic with two limes.

411
00:17:55.417 --> 00:17:56.417
Okay.

412
00:17:58.042 --> 00:17:59.833
Yeah.
Hey. can I ask you a favor?

413
00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:01.125
Mmm-hmm.

414
00:18:02.458 --> 00:18:04.417
You see those people over there?

415
00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:10.167
I'm at this really boring
business function.

416
00:18:10.208 --> 00:18:12.500
If I buy you that drink.
you promise to rescue me?

417
00:18:12.542 --> 00:18:14.708
Hmm. I think
that could be arranged.

418
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.833
Cheers.

419
00:18:22.875 --> 00:18:23.833
Cheers.

420
00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:27.667
So. what do you do
when you're not being stood up

421
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:28.708
on blind dates?

422
00:18:28.792 --> 00:18:30.833
[chuckles]

423
00:18:30.917 --> 00:18:32.917
I go where the story takes me.

424
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.542
I'm a freelance journalist.

425
00:18:35.667 --> 00:18:37.958
I bet you get some
really good stories.

426
00:18:38.042 --> 00:18:39.167
Oh. my gosh.

427
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.833
More than
you could even imagine.

428
00:18:42.167 --> 00:18:44.333
But what about you?
What company do you work for?

429
00:18:46.208 --> 00:18:48.208
Settel Pharmaceuticals.

430
00:18:49.208 --> 00:18:51.667
Shane Settel.

431
00:18:51.792 --> 00:18:53.333
It's your company?

432
00:18:53.375 --> 00:18:55.125
-Uh-hmm.
-Wow.

433
00:18:55.208 --> 00:18:56.583
But you're so--

434
00:18:56.667 --> 00:18:58.125
Devastatingly handsome?

435
00:18:58.208 --> 00:19:00.917
[chuckles]
I was going to say young.

436
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.375
but. yeah.

437
00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:05.542
Well. my father. he was the CEO.

438
00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:07.167
But he just
passed away recently.

439
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.500
Oh. I'm so sorry.

440
00:19:08.583 --> 00:19:09.958
It's okay.

441
00:19:10.042 --> 00:19:12.500
Have you heard of Tranquilify?

442
00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:13.708
[laughs] Yeah.

443
00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:15.375
Who hasn't? That's you?

444
00:19:16.708 --> 00:19:17.625
That's it.

445
00:19:18.542 --> 00:19:20.125
My sister and I.
when we were kids.

446
00:19:20.208 --> 00:19:21.708
my mom got really sick

447
00:19:21.792 --> 00:19:23.750
and my dad told us
he didn't want anyone else

448
00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:25.375
to ever suffer like that again.

449
00:19:25.458 --> 00:19:28.292
So. I always knew
that I would take over one day.

450
00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:30.375
I just didn't think
it would happen so soon.

451
00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:33.375
And I'm guessing
it hasn't been smooth sailing?

452
00:19:33.458 --> 00:19:35.833
No. No. it's been
very interesting.

453
00:19:35.917 --> 00:19:38.167
It's been. like. riding out
a storm in a paper boat.

454
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:39.542
-[chuckles]
-[Shane] Don't get me wrong.

455
00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:40.625
I love what I do.

456
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.833
I was born for this.

457
00:19:41.917 --> 00:19:42.833
My first words were drug patent.

458
00:19:42.917 --> 00:19:44.000
but wild.

459
00:19:44.083 --> 00:19:46.000
Right.

460
00:19:46.042 --> 00:19:48.000
You love your job
and although you're here

461
00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:49.792
at an incredibly boring
business function.

462
00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:51.708
you're still chatting it up
with a strange woman

463
00:19:51.708 --> 00:19:53.458
-you barely even know.
-That's not true.

464
00:19:53.542 --> 00:19:55.042
Well then. what's my name?

465
00:19:55.125 --> 00:19:56.000
What?

466
00:19:56.083 --> 00:19:57.667
What's my name?

467
00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:01.708
[laughs]

468
00:20:03.917 --> 00:20:06.167
I know it starts with an N.

469
00:20:07.208 --> 00:20:08.667
Okay.

470
00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:09.792
Nancy.

471
00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:11.292
-Hmm.
-Nicole.

472
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.500
Come on. Natalie.

473
00:20:14.583 --> 00:20:15.667
Come on.

474
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.333
[chuckles]

475
00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:19.917
Well. you're probably
one of the funniest CEOs

476
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.625
I've ever met. Shane.

477
00:20:21.708 --> 00:20:23.833
It's the nicest thing that's
been said about me all week.

478
00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:28.333
Well. you don't think you should
be getting back over there?

479
00:20:28.417 --> 00:20:30.167
Why? Do you wanna
get out of here?

480
00:20:32.917 --> 00:20:35.250
Here is what I'm gonna do.

481
00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:39.042
I'm going to give you
a kiss on the cheek.

482
00:20:39.167 --> 00:20:41.167
tell you I had a lovely evening.

483
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.083
then I'm gonna give you
my number.

484
00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:45.250
But you're gonna wait
a couple days

485
00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:47.958
because you don't
wanna come off too eager.

486
00:20:48.042 --> 00:20:49.625
And then you're gonna call me

487
00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:51.250
and you're gonna ask me
to dinner.

488
00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.958
French or Italian?

489
00:20:54.375 --> 00:20:58.292
I love Italian.
and I can't wait.

490
00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:12.458
And who was that?

491
00:21:12.542 --> 00:21:14.167
The woman I'm gonna marry.

492
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.833
[Jackson chuckles]

493
00:21:15.833 --> 00:21:17.583
Mazel tov.

494
00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:26.500
[suspenseful music]

495
00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:50.917
[vehicles honking]

496
00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:58.792
[Olivia] What happened
to you last night?

497
00:22:02.042 --> 00:22:02.958
I met someone.

498
00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:05.875
[Olivia]
You left a company dinner

499
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.292
to celebrate a deal you closed

500
00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:09.250
because you met someone?

501
00:22:09.333 --> 00:22:11.292
I met someone I really like.

502
00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:14.417
Well. that explains it.

503
00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:19.333
[laughs] I want a coffee.
You want a coffee?

504
00:22:19.417 --> 00:22:21.500
Two non-fat cappuccinos. please.

505
00:22:21.625 --> 00:22:24.083
-[man] Absolutely.
-Seriously. how did you do it?

506
00:22:24.167 --> 00:22:26.500
Are you doubting my
brilliant business instincts?

507
00:22:26.583 --> 00:22:27.917
Yesterday.
you were kicking the tires

508
00:22:28.042 --> 00:22:29.667
on a hostile takeover.

509
00:22:29.708 --> 00:22:32.500
You have Jackson throw
a Hail Mary pass to the COO.

510
00:22:32.542 --> 00:22:35.750
And less than 24 hours later.
he's acting CEO.

511
00:22:35.833 --> 00:22:38.167
Which means you're either
smarter than dad.

512
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.125
or you're
the luckiest man alive.

513
00:22:40.208 --> 00:22:42.417
I think you're gonna feel better
once you get some caffeine.

514
00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.000
You knew something.

515
00:22:46.208 --> 00:22:48.333
[exhales deeply]

516
00:22:54.708 --> 00:22:56.542
Okay.

517
00:22:56.667 --> 00:22:58.750
So. what do you know
about tarot?

518
00:22:58.833 --> 00:23:01.708
The cards? Nothing.
Less than nothing. really.

519
00:23:01.792 --> 00:23:03.792
-Well. Dad believed in 'em.
-Dad wouldn't cross the street

520
00:23:03.875 --> 00:23:06.500
unless a palm reader told him
it was safe.

521
00:23:06.542 --> 00:23:08.417
What if he was right?

522
00:23:10.458 --> 00:23:12.625
Have you heard
of Arabella Prescott?

523
00:23:12.708 --> 00:23:14.792
Doesn't she have a reality show?

524
00:23:14.875 --> 00:23:16.958
Well. she's got a great
little spot up in Topanga

525
00:23:17.042 --> 00:23:17.958
and I went for a visit.

526
00:23:19.583 --> 00:23:21.167
You went to a psychic?

527
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.417
No. I went to one
of her intuitives.

528
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.833
So. out of the blue.

529
00:23:23.875 --> 00:23:25.667
you've decided to embrace
Dad's superstitions?

530
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.375
Okay. What if his
superstitions were right?

531
00:23:28.458 --> 00:23:30.333
He built
a billion-dollar company.

532
00:23:30.417 --> 00:23:31.833
What if this
was the secret sauce?

533
00:23:32.917 --> 00:23:34.958
So. this psychic
told you what to do?

534
00:23:35.042 --> 00:23:36.250
More like she showed me.

535
00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:37.500
That Irving Polk
was going to die?

536
00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:39.042
Not in so many words. but. yeah.

537
00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:41.667
You sound just like Dad.

538
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:43.667
-Thank you?
-Look. Shane.

539
00:23:43.708 --> 00:23:44.917
I don't know
what this one woman did

540
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.500
or did not show you.
but I do know

541
00:23:46.583 --> 00:23:48.333
she did not predict
Irving Polk's death.

542
00:23:48.417 --> 00:23:51.583
Yet it worked out in our favor.
didn't it?

543
00:23:51.708 --> 00:23:53.458
Now. just take a read.
Take a read.

544
00:23:55.208 --> 00:23:56.708
[sighs]

545
00:24:00.042 --> 00:24:01.625
[sigh]

546
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:04.292
-A psychic?
-One of her minions

547
00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:06.333
told him Irving Polk
was going to die.

548
00:24:06.458 --> 00:24:09.667
He bet the future of the
company on tarot cards?

549
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.000
The apple didn't fall as far
from the tree as I thought.

550
00:24:13.375 --> 00:24:14.792
You think it's time?

551
00:24:14.875 --> 00:24:16.500
The man just doubled
the value of their equity.

552
00:24:16.625 --> 00:24:19.042
Ditching him is the last thing
the board's going to do.

553
00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:23.417
Look. just because your father
didn't pick the right horse

554
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.042
doesn't mean it's too late.

555
00:24:26.167 --> 00:24:27.542
Before you cash your ticket.

556
00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:29.167
I wanna find out just how far

557
00:24:29.208 --> 00:24:31.167
this guru's influence goes.

558
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:32.583
You want me to get into it?

559
00:24:32.667 --> 00:24:34.917
It would look like a
conflict of interest if I did.

560
00:24:35.042 --> 00:24:36.833
-Well. I could ask him.
-[Olivia] No. no.

561
00:24:36.917 --> 00:24:38.542
He'd never talk to you
about this.

562
00:24:38.625 --> 00:24:39.833
You need a different approach.

563
00:24:40.958 --> 00:24:41.958
Then who?

564
00:24:42.042 --> 00:24:44.792
[dramatic music]

565
00:24:50.875 --> 00:24:52.500
[Maya]
Back for more hocus pocus?

566
00:24:55.375 --> 00:24:56.833
I don't know how you did it.

567
00:24:56.917 --> 00:24:58.708
but I couldn't have done it
without you.

568
00:24:58.792 --> 00:25:00.833
Well. I'm flattered.
but. you know.

569
00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:02.833
I don't take responsibility
for what happened.

570
00:25:02.917 --> 00:25:03.792
But still.

571
00:25:05.375 --> 00:25:07.458
Just curious if you can tell me
what's next.

572
00:25:07.542 --> 00:25:08.792
There you go again.

573
00:25:08.875 --> 00:25:10.167
asking for the winning
lottery numbers.

574
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.917
Just some guidance. That's it.

575
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.292
[sighs] Come on.

576
00:25:14.375 --> 00:25:17.458
[suspenseful music]

577
00:25:21.542 --> 00:25:23.667
This is a standard
four-card spread.

578
00:25:23.708 --> 00:25:25.500
I look at it as a glimpse
into your life.

579
00:25:25.542 --> 00:25:27.000
where you've been.
where you are.

580
00:25:27.042 --> 00:25:28.375
and where you're going.

581
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.667
Well. I'd like to go
to the Maldives.

582
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.667
So hopefully the
cards say that.

583
00:25:31.708 --> 00:25:33.500
The first card
represents the past.

584
00:25:35.375 --> 00:25:36.500
The Ten of Pentacles.

585
00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:38.333
The castle card.

586
00:25:38.417 --> 00:25:40.292
Note the importance of family.

587
00:25:40.375 --> 00:25:43.917
And their garden indicates
great opulence and wealth.

588
00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.250
Oh. so in other words.

589
00:25:45.333 --> 00:25:46.625
that's my family
business. right?

590
00:25:46.708 --> 00:25:48.625
Now. you're getting it.

591
00:25:48.708 --> 00:25:51.042
The second card represents
your current situation.

592
00:25:52.292 --> 00:25:53.667
The Chariot.

593
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.750
You have an exciting journey
ahead of you.

594
00:25:55.875 --> 00:25:58.042
But it also represents triumph.

595
00:25:58.042 --> 00:26:00.750
You are willfully moving
towards the finish line.

596
00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:02.042
Victory is just ahead.

597
00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:04.792
I like that card.

598
00:26:04.875 --> 00:26:06.917
All right. The future.

599
00:26:09.292 --> 00:26:10.500
You've met someone recently?

600
00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:12.375
[chuckles]

601
00:26:12.458 --> 00:26:15.500
Oh. yeah. Actually. I have.

602
00:26:15.542 --> 00:26:18.375
[Maya] I see a deep connection
and attraction.

603
00:26:18.458 --> 00:26:21.667
An intense strong bond. harmony.

604
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.083
So you're saying
I should call her?

605
00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:27.000
This last card represents

606
00:26:27.042 --> 00:26:29.333
how you will forge ahead
in your journey.

607
00:26:29.417 --> 00:26:30.667
Hit me. I'm all in.

608
00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:34.333
[Maya]
You will be a strong leader.

609
00:26:34.417 --> 00:26:36.500
Compassionate. empathetic.

610
00:26:36.625 --> 00:26:38.417
but it also indicates
that your relationship

611
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.250
is loving and mature.

612
00:26:40.333 --> 00:26:41.583
Well-balanced.

613
00:26:41.708 --> 00:26:43.167
This woman you mentioned.

614
00:26:43.292 --> 00:26:45.667
would you say she's respectful
and passionate?

615
00:26:45.792 --> 00:26:47.708
I don't know. I barely even...

616
00:26:49.792 --> 00:26:51.667
you gotta be kidding me.

617
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.458
[Maya] What is it?

618
00:26:53.542 --> 00:26:55.833
Her last name is King.

619
00:27:11.458 --> 00:27:14.333
Carnelian. It promotes vitality.

620
00:27:14.417 --> 00:27:15.417
Are you looking for yourself?

621
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.875
Uh. girlfriend.

622
00:27:18.375 --> 00:27:19.875
Metatron's cube.

623
00:27:19.958 --> 00:27:21.333
It represents
the balance and harmony

624
00:27:21.375 --> 00:27:22.875
of energy in the universe.

625
00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:25.333
I always like to think
of it as a reminder.

626
00:27:25.375 --> 00:27:26.667
that the universe wants us

627
00:27:26.708 --> 00:27:28.333
to use our personal power
productively.

628
00:27:28.458 --> 00:27:30.833
Hmm. No pressure there.

629
00:27:30.958 --> 00:27:33.333
Just let me know
if something catches your eye.

630
00:27:33.458 --> 00:27:35.125
Yeah. What about a reading?

631
00:27:35.208 --> 00:27:37.958
You feeling stuck?
In need of guidance?

632
00:27:38.042 --> 00:27:39.667
Maya Priestley.

633
00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:41.333
Tyler Armstrong.

634
00:27:41.417 --> 00:27:42.833
Right this way.

635
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.583
Make yourself comfortable.

636
00:27:50.667 --> 00:27:52.625
I'll brew some tea.

637
00:27:52.708 --> 00:27:54.542
How long has this place
been here?

638
00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:55.917
Believe it or not.
this is Arabella's

639
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.333
20th year in business.

640
00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:59.167
I read a book.

641
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.917
Fascinating stuff.

642
00:28:06.875 --> 00:28:08.375
-[beeps]
-It's amazing how many people

643
00:28:08.458 --> 00:28:10.750
she's helped over the years.

644
00:28:10.833 --> 00:28:12.167
Notable people.

645
00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:13.667
[Tyler] Such as?

646
00:28:13.708 --> 00:28:15.917
Confidentiality is a key
to our business.

647
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.333
I'm sure you'll understand.

648
00:28:17.458 --> 00:28:19.292
Right.

649
00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:21.458
[Maya] Let's just say
there's more than a few names

650
00:28:21.542 --> 00:28:22.875
on the Forbes list.

651
00:28:24.208 --> 00:28:25.917
Possibly even
a president or two.

652
00:28:27.292 --> 00:28:29.500
And how long
have you been doing this?

653
00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:30.708
Long enough.

654
00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:32.333
[Tyler] Thank you.

655
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.250
[Maya] Lemon balm reduces
tension and muscle tightness.

656
00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:37.667
[sips]

657
00:28:37.708 --> 00:28:39.208
You are intuitive.

658
00:28:42.042 --> 00:28:43.875
What kind of reading
would you like. Mr. Armstrong?

659
00:28:43.958 --> 00:28:45.500
[Tyler] Uh. Tyler. please.

660
00:28:45.667 --> 00:28:47.542
Mr. Armstrong is so formal.

661
00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:49.708
[Maya] Okay. Let's start simple.

662
00:28:49.833 --> 00:28:51.833
Three cards. crossed spread.

663
00:28:51.875 --> 00:28:54.958
The situation. an obstacle.
and advice.

664
00:28:55.042 --> 00:28:56.167
Great.

665
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.833
First. we start
with the situation.

666
00:29:00.708 --> 00:29:02.292
[Tyler scoffs]

667
00:29:02.375 --> 00:29:04.333
So. I'm supposed to buy
a vowel or something?

668
00:29:04.458 --> 00:29:07.333
[chuckles] I like to think
of it as the wheel of karma.

669
00:29:07.417 --> 00:29:09.167
What comes around goes around.

670
00:29:09.208 --> 00:29:12.292
There are factors
beyond your control at play.

671
00:29:12.375 --> 00:29:14.708
Perhaps there's been
a period of transition at work.

672
00:29:14.833 --> 00:29:16.958
Uh. you could say that.

673
00:29:17.042 --> 00:29:18.708
What is it that you do?

674
00:29:20.542 --> 00:29:21.833
Confidentiality.

675
00:29:22.958 --> 00:29:24.000
Now. the obstacle.

676
00:29:25.875 --> 00:29:29.042
Beware. you could be following
a false leader.

677
00:29:29.042 --> 00:29:30.708
someone leading you astray.

678
00:29:30.792 --> 00:29:32.875
seeking justice
for the wrong reasons.

679
00:29:32.875 --> 00:29:34.958
causing more harm than good.

680
00:29:35.042 --> 00:29:36.750
Does this mean something to you?

681
00:29:36.875 --> 00:29:39.917
Uh. who doesn't have drama
in their life these days?

682
00:29:44.708 --> 00:29:46.958
-Whoa. [chuckles]
-Don't worry.

683
00:29:47.042 --> 00:29:48.708
It doesn't always mean
what you think.

684
00:29:48.708 --> 00:29:50.667
Yeah. that wasn't
very reassuring.

685
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.500
Think of death as
the ultimate transformation.

686
00:29:53.542 --> 00:29:55.000
a doorway to rebirth.

687
00:29:55.042 --> 00:29:58.500
So. what's the advice?

688
00:29:58.542 --> 00:30:00.083
Embrace the transformation.

689
00:30:00.208 --> 00:30:02.458
Let go. Change your ways.

690
00:30:02.542 --> 00:30:04.542
Don't hold onto the past.

691
00:30:04.667 --> 00:30:07.500
In other words.
out with the old.

692
00:30:07.583 --> 00:30:09.500
in with the new.

693
00:30:09.625 --> 00:30:10.833
[Maya] And above all else.

694
00:30:10.917 --> 00:30:13.500
be careful who you trust.

695
00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:14.792
[sips]

696
00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:19.917
[distant sirens wailing]

697
00:30:21.792 --> 00:30:24.667
-Welcome to my humble abode.
-[Natalie chuckles]

698
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.917
So. why did you send
the bottle back?

699
00:30:28.417 --> 00:30:30.000
Wine.

700
00:30:30.042 --> 00:30:32.458
-We need more wine.
-[Natalie chuckles]

701
00:30:32.542 --> 00:30:34.667
I think the last thing
you need is more wine.

702
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.875
Uh. touché. You may be right.

703
00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.667
Music.

704
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.708
Yes. Uh. hang on.

705
00:30:41.833 --> 00:30:45.292
It's similar in... aha.

706
00:30:45.375 --> 00:30:47.958
Got it. Here.

707
00:30:48.917 --> 00:30:49.958
Do you even know
how that thing works?

708
00:30:50.042 --> 00:30:51.792
That thing happens to be

709
00:30:51.875 --> 00:30:54.667
125 decibels of pure sonic joy.

710
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:55.792
Is that a lot?

711
00:30:55.875 --> 00:30:57.333
It costs a lot.

712
00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.833
Hang on.

-left the building at 4:00.
-4:00 PM?

890
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.042
Tyler wouldn't have left
that early.

891
00:39:20.167 --> 00:39:21.875
[Rita] So I'll ask you again.

892
00:39:21.958 --> 00:39:24.583
I let him in.
He left his card in the car.

893
00:39:24.708 --> 00:39:26.542
Why didn't he just go get it?

894
00:39:26.625 --> 00:39:28.667
I don't know. I just happened
to be in the lobby

895
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.458
and I saw him.

896
00:39:30.542 --> 00:39:32.667
But it was an overdose?

897
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.542
Technically.
it was cardiac arrest.

898
00:39:34.625 --> 00:39:36.500
but the ME believes the ketamine

899
00:39:36.583 --> 00:39:38.000
was a contributing factor.

900
00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:40.917
[cell phone buzzing]

901
00:39:43.292 --> 00:39:45.083
Uh. it's work.

902
00:39:45.208 --> 00:39:46.125
I'll catch up.

903
00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:52.625
[sighs]

904
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.750
So...

905
00:39:57.708 --> 00:39:59.458
how long were you
and Tyler sleeping together?

906
00:40:00.375 --> 00:40:01.500
Wow.

907
00:40:02.708 --> 00:40:05.833
-You are a detective.
-Even worse.

908
00:40:05.958 --> 00:40:08.042
I'm a sorority sister.

909
00:40:08.125 --> 00:40:10.458
-Does Shane know?
-No.

910
00:40:10.542 --> 00:40:11.958
And I'd like to keep it
that way.

911
00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:14.167
Was it serious?

912
00:40:14.208 --> 00:40:16.167
No.

913
00:40:16.208 --> 00:40:17.375
Maybe.

914
00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:20.333
I don't know.

915
00:40:20.417 --> 00:40:22.208
Were you with him
the night he died?

916
00:40:22.292 --> 00:40:24.333
-No.
-Olivia. if I find out

917
00:40:24.417 --> 00:40:26.792
-you're lying to me about this.
-I'm not.

918
00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:29.875
He didn't come back
to the office that afternoon.

919
00:40:29.958 --> 00:40:31.000
did he?

920
00:40:31.083 --> 00:40:32.125
[sighs]

921
00:40:35.875 --> 00:40:37.208
No.

922
00:40:37.292 --> 00:40:39.292
Do you know where he went?

923
00:40:39.375 --> 00:40:41.083
He was doing research.

924
00:40:41.167 --> 00:40:42.917
For Shane?

925
00:40:42.917 --> 00:40:44.417
For me.

926
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.083
What sort of research
was he doing?

927
00:40:46.167 --> 00:40:47.667
It's not important.

928
00:40:47.708 --> 00:40:49.500
You'd be surprised
how many cases

929
00:40:49.583 --> 00:40:51.417
not important has solved.

930
00:40:53.917 --> 00:40:56.000
My brother's been
seeing a psychic.

931
00:40:56.083 --> 00:40:57.542
That's not against the law.

932
00:40:57.542 --> 00:40:58.667
What about fraud?

933
00:41:00.042 --> 00:41:02.333
-So you sent Tyler to find out?
-Can you blame me?

934
00:41:02.458 --> 00:41:04.208
I wanted to find out
who my brother was

935
00:41:04.292 --> 00:41:05.667
trusting with our company.

936
00:41:05.708 --> 00:41:07.333
It's our father's legacy.

937
00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:08.792
And what did Tyler find out?

938
00:41:08.875 --> 00:41:11.042
I never got the chance to ask.

939
00:41:13.375 --> 00:41:15.458
Can I offer you some advice

940
00:41:15.542 --> 00:41:18.292
from someone on the outside
looking in?

941
00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:20.000
Take some time

942
00:41:20.083 --> 00:41:22.458
away from work. both of you.

943
00:41:22.542 --> 00:41:23.708
Clear your head.

944
00:41:30.792 --> 00:41:32.625
Modifications of repositions?

945
00:41:32.708 --> 00:41:34.333
I don't understand.
Where's the Biosurgix tech?

946
00:41:34.375 --> 00:41:36.542
I have some serious concerns
regarding the durability.

947
00:41:36.667 --> 00:41:39.333
Serious concerns?

948
00:41:39.375 --> 00:41:41.042
My honest opinion?

949
00:41:41.125 --> 00:41:45.042
Their CEP was severely
substandard. at best.

950
00:41:45.125 --> 00:41:47.333
Well. I have an earnings call
in two hours.

951
00:41:47.375 --> 00:41:48.458
They're gonna wanna know
what we paid for.

952
00:41:48.542 --> 00:41:50.000
It will work.

953
00:41:50.042 --> 00:41:51.792
But not if we can't get it
past the CDRH.

954
00:41:51.875 --> 00:41:53.833
No. I can't move a needle
with ifs and buts.

955
00:41:53.917 --> 00:41:55.583
I need something tangible.
I'm in the weeds here. doc.

956
00:41:55.708 --> 00:41:57.417
-Give me something.
-Shane. listen to me.

957
00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.500
You employ me from a medical
expertise and I'm telling you.

958
00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:01.500
this is not the time
to push this through.

959
00:42:01.667 --> 00:42:03.208
Well. Natalie thinks
that we need

960
00:42:03.333 --> 00:42:05.750
to drop a bomb
of an announcement now.

961
00:42:05.875 --> 00:42:07.875
Tell the world that we're deadly
serious about the tech game.

962
00:42:09.917 --> 00:42:11.417
Can we take a moment
outside. please?

963
00:42:11.542 --> 00:42:12.833
I'm perfectly comfortable
right here.

964
00:42:12.917 --> 00:42:13.750
[clears throat]

965
00:42:16.958 --> 00:42:18.042
Now.

966
00:42:20.583 --> 00:42:22.042
Just take five. guys.

967
00:42:23.583 --> 00:42:25.375
Tell me I didn't just hear
what I think I heard.

968
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.167
Hey. you wanna turn it
down a notch?

969
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.208
You're taking business advice
from your girlfriend?

970
00:42:29.292 --> 00:42:31.083
-She happens to be brilliant.
-Do you know who else

971
00:42:31.167 --> 00:42:33.042
"happens to be brilliant?"
Your chief medical officer.

972
00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:34.917
The one with a doctorate
of medicine from Harvard?

973
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.708
So no one else's
opinion matters?

974
00:42:36.833 --> 00:42:38.958
Of course not. But it also
doesn't mean taking the advice

975
00:42:39.042 --> 00:42:40.750
-of your so-called girlfriend.
-Excuse me?

976
00:42:40.833 --> 00:42:42.708
Over trusted
medical professionals.

977
00:42:42.792 --> 00:42:44.667
The only reason we have
this deal is because of me.

978
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.417
The only reason we have
this deal is because

979
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.167
of some charlatan you paid
God-knows-what

980
00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:49.750
to fill your head
with a bunch of nonsense.

981
00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:51.583
You think you can do better?

982
00:42:51.667 --> 00:42:53.000
Call the board
and see how far you get.

983
00:42:53.083 --> 00:42:54.833
You better get your head
in the game

984
00:42:54.833 --> 00:42:56.792
because I'm not going down
with your ship.

985
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.125
[Shane] Olivia doesn't
understand.

986
00:43:03.208 --> 00:43:04.708
She's never had anybody.

987
00:43:04.792 --> 00:43:06.708
To be fair. you did put
a key business decision

988
00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:08.417
in the hands of someone
she's never met.

989
00:43:08.542 --> 00:43:10.208
You can't be a leader

990
00:43:10.292 --> 00:43:12.000
if you don't make decisions.

991
00:43:12.083 --> 00:43:15.042
The last time we met.
you spoke of a certain jealousy.

992
00:43:15.125 --> 00:43:17.333
that your father left the
company to you instead of her?

993
00:43:17.375 --> 00:43:18.667
Yeah.

994
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.083
[Maya] Do you agree?

995
00:43:23.042 --> 00:43:25.833
Yeah. I mean. she's always been
the more ambitious one.

996
00:43:25.917 --> 00:43:27.833
She got better grades in school.

997
00:43:27.958 --> 00:43:29.250
always performed better. yeah.

998
00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:30.833
So why you?

999
00:43:30.875 --> 00:43:31.833
[sighs]

1000
00:43:33.208 --> 00:43:34.667
Did you know that men
are twice as likely

1001
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.042
to inherit a business
than women?

1002
00:43:36.125 --> 00:43:37.292
-I did not know that.
-[Shane] Yeah.

1003
00:43:37.375 --> 00:43:39.667
And sons are 75%

1004
00:43:39.708 --> 00:43:42.500
more likely to be appointed
to an executive position

1005
00:43:42.625 --> 00:43:43.833
and it's all because the Normans
wanted to hold

1006
00:43:43.958 --> 00:43:45.500
onto power back in the 1100's.

1007
00:43:45.583 --> 00:43:47.167
It's this old.

1008
00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:49.167
archaic. outdated tradition.

1009
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.542
In other words you don't think
you were qualified.

1010
00:43:50.625 --> 00:43:52.458
No. I know
that I wasn't qualified.

1011
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:54.333
Because you didn't read
as many books?

1012
00:43:54.417 --> 00:43:57.208
Because you didn't score higher
on a college board?

1013
00:43:57.292 --> 00:43:58.875
[sighs]

1014
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.125
Sit.

1015
00:44:06.542 --> 00:44:08.542
Let's say I ask your sister
to come down here.

1016
00:44:08.625 --> 00:44:10.958
asked her to describe you.

1017
00:44:11.042 --> 00:44:12.958
-What words would she use?
-I'm sure she'd have a lot

1018
00:44:13.042 --> 00:44:15.083
of choice words to describe me.

1019
00:44:19.792 --> 00:44:22.083
Rebellious. uh. instinctual.

1020
00:44:22.167 --> 00:44:25.000
impulsive. overly-confident.
I'm sure are a few.

1021
00:44:25.125 --> 00:44:26.292
Charming.

1022
00:44:27.542 --> 00:44:29.083
Occasionally. yeah.

1023
00:44:30.458 --> 00:44:31.833
Interesting.

1024
00:44:31.958 --> 00:44:33.750
You just described
a born leader.

1025
00:44:41.125 --> 00:44:44.333
Okay.
This is a quick two-card cross.

1026
00:44:44.417 --> 00:44:46.875
You're stuck. carrying weight.

1027
00:44:46.958 --> 00:44:49.083
Card one represents
the situation.

1028
00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:52.250
Card two is the solution
to overcome it.

1029
00:44:52.375 --> 00:44:54.833
First. the situation.

1030
00:44:54.875 --> 00:44:56.625
Notice the man.
What is he looking at?

1031
00:44:56.708 --> 00:44:58.000
His cups.

1032
00:44:58.042 --> 00:44:59.917
The three that is
knocked over. right?

1033
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.708
He's disappointed. He failed.

1034
00:45:02.792 --> 00:45:05.083
After all.
three of his cups are gone.

1035
00:45:05.167 --> 00:45:06.500
But. behind him?

1036
00:45:06.542 --> 00:45:07.792
There are two more cups.

1037
00:45:07.875 --> 00:45:09.833
[Maya] Exactly.

1038
00:45:09.917 --> 00:45:11.417
He's so worried
about the three that he's lost.

1039
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.667
he's completely ignoring the two

1040
00:45:12.792 --> 00:45:14.833
that are still standing.

1041
00:45:14.917 --> 00:45:15.958
Hmm.

1042
00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:19.917
I think I get the message.

1043
00:45:20.042 --> 00:45:21.292
Is it possible that you're
too concerned

1044
00:45:21.375 --> 00:45:23.000
with the reasons
you're not a good leader

1045
00:45:23.042 --> 00:45:25.083
you're missing
the reasons you are?

1046
00:45:28.042 --> 00:45:30.917
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Next card. Next one.

1047
00:45:31.042 --> 00:45:32.208
It's the tool the universe
has given you

1048
00:45:32.292 --> 00:45:33.958
to overcome the situation.

1049
00:45:36.042 --> 00:45:38.000
There is a strong woman
in your life.

1050
00:45:38.083 --> 00:45:40.875
She's elegant. sensual. fertile.

1051
00:45:40.958 --> 00:45:42.667
Connect with her.

1052
00:45:42.708 --> 00:45:44.375
Connect with your senses.

1053
00:45:46.833 --> 00:45:49.042
Uh. what? That's it?

1054
00:45:49.208 --> 00:45:51.250
Not quite.

1055
00:45:51.333 --> 00:45:52.375
Take a closer look.

1056
00:45:55.042 --> 00:45:57.833
Notice the woman is surrounded
by a beautiful forest.

1057
00:45:57.917 --> 00:46:00.625
Nourishing golden wheat springs
from the ground.

1058
00:46:00.708 --> 00:46:02.708
Abundance.

1059
00:46:02.792 --> 00:46:04.000
Like the woman.
you were surrounded

1060
00:46:04.083 --> 00:46:06.083
by life's pleasures and luxury.

1061
00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:09.083
However. if you embrace
your softer side

1062
00:46:09.167 --> 00:46:11.000
and allow yourself
to explore the emotions

1063
00:46:11.083 --> 00:46:13.875
you're feeling you will be able
to provide for others.

1064
00:46:13.958 --> 00:46:15.417
You're talking about
my feelings for Natalie.

1065
00:46:16.792 --> 00:46:18.625
What you have is real.

1066
00:46:18.708 --> 00:46:20.292
Trust your heart.

1067
00:46:20.375 --> 00:46:21.750
And everything
you've ever dreamed up

1068
00:46:21.833 --> 00:46:23.333
will come to fruition.

1069
00:46:23.417 --> 00:46:26.292
[dramatic music]

1070
00:46:30.667 --> 00:46:33.792
Maya. uh. um. thank you.

1071
00:46:33.875 --> 00:46:35.708
Thank you.

1072
00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:37.542
Uh. do you mind? Can I hang on--

1073
00:46:37.542 --> 00:46:39.000
-It's yours.
-[Shane] Yes?

1074
00:46:39.083 --> 00:46:41.250
-[Maya laughs]
-Thank you.

1075
00:46:41.333 --> 00:46:44.417
[plane engine humming]

1076
00:46:50.708 --> 00:46:54.042
[dramatic music]

1077
00:47:22.333 --> 00:47:23.792
[glass clinks]

1078
00:47:27.458 --> 00:47:29.333
So what do you think?

1079
00:47:29.458 --> 00:47:31.833
I mean. when they said a lady
wants to be swept off her feet.

1080
00:47:31.958 --> 00:47:34.167
I don't think
they meant 33.000 feet.

1081
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:35.667
[laughter]

1082
00:47:35.708 --> 00:47:37.042
I mean. where are we even
going anyways?

1083
00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:38.792
It's just an hour. hour
and a half tops.

1084
00:47:38.875 --> 00:47:41.208
Hmm. Vegas?

1085
00:47:44.708 --> 00:47:45.833
San Francisco?

1086
00:47:47.167 --> 00:47:48.083
Try again.

1087
00:47:49.625 --> 00:47:51.667
-Phoenix?
-You trust me. right?

1088
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.375
I do.

1089
00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:55.583
Then you're just gonna have
to wait and see.

1090
00:47:55.708 --> 00:47:57.667
You're gonna spoil me.
Shane Settel.

1091
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.292
I hope so.

1092
00:47:59.375 --> 00:48:02.125
[dramatic music]

1093
00:48:37.375 --> 00:48:38.458
He sent this out?

1094
00:48:38.542 --> 00:48:40.583
To 100.000 news outlets

1095
00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:42.667
in 160 countries.

1096
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.958
-Jackson. Keep trying him.
-Sure.

1097
00:48:45.042 --> 00:48:46.167
I'll call you back.

1098
00:48:47.542 --> 00:48:50.042
[Olivia] You read this?
"Scheduled to be rolled out

1099
00:48:50.125 --> 00:48:52.167
in the fourth quarter.
Settel Pharmaceuticals'

1100
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:54.458
cutting edge system is poised
to redefine precision

1101
00:48:54.542 --> 00:48:55.875
in stereotactic surgery."

1102
00:48:55.958 --> 00:48:58.000
Did I read it? Oh. yeah.

1103
00:48:58.083 --> 00:48:59.750
And if our stock price
climbs any higher.

1104
00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:01.167
I'm gonna need
to negotiate your rights.

1105
00:49:01.208 --> 00:49:02.833
The FDA is gonna hang us.

1106
00:49:02.875 --> 00:49:04.625
And my brother is building
the gallows.

1107
00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:06.500
And it seems our board is giving
him an endless supply of lumber.

1108
00:49:06.583 --> 00:49:07.792
This has to stop.

1109
00:49:07.875 --> 00:49:09.125
Well. if he would answer
his phone

1110
00:49:09.208 --> 00:49:10.958
every now and then.
we could discuss it.

1111
00:49:11.042 --> 00:49:12.667
But it seems the only action
items he's interested

1112
00:49:12.792 --> 00:49:15.542
in these days are the ones
involving his new girlfriend.

1113
00:49:15.625 --> 00:49:17.833
Maybe we should just fire
the entire comms department

1114
00:49:17.875 --> 00:49:19.833
-and hire her.
-Well. she is a journalist.

1115
00:49:19.875 --> 00:49:21.333
She has a blog.

1116
00:49:21.417 --> 00:49:23.458
-My neighbor's cat has a blog.
-[laughs]

1117
00:49:25.042 --> 00:49:26.875
What is this really about?

1118
00:49:27.042 --> 00:49:30.000
Jackson. you've been
with the company a long time.

1119
00:49:30.125 --> 00:49:32.042
And you knew my father better
than anyone.

1120
00:49:32.167 --> 00:49:33.917
-Yes. I did.
-[Olivia] What did you know

1121
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.333
about my father's interest
in mysticism?

1122
00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:40.333
[sighs] Look.

1123
00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:43.792
When a man like your father
reaches that level of success.

1124
00:49:43.875 --> 00:49:45.667
there's always gonna be people
looking to bring him down.

1125
00:49:45.792 --> 00:49:47.125
So it wasn't true?

1126
00:49:47.208 --> 00:49:49.208
Did he read his horoscope
every day? Yeah.

1127
00:49:49.333 --> 00:49:52.000
Did he visit a psychic
every once in a while? Sure.

1128
00:49:52.125 --> 00:49:54.708
But he also had
a PhD in finance.

1129
00:49:54.792 --> 00:49:56.542
Not to mention an IQ over 160.

1130
00:49:56.625 --> 00:49:58.083
He was a brilliant man.

1131
00:49:58.208 --> 00:50:00.583
So what is this really about?

1132
00:50:00.708 --> 00:50:02.375
-Nothing.
-If I were you.

1133
00:50:02.458 --> 00:50:04.875
what I'd be concerned with
is the government.

1134
00:50:04.958 --> 00:50:06.333
We still have capital
to commissioner?

1135
00:50:06.375 --> 00:50:08.250
Yeah. Always .

1136
00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.958
But it's gonna be expensive.

1137
00:50:10.042 --> 00:50:11.083
Not as expensive as losing

1138
00:50:11.167 --> 00:50:13.167
the faith of our investors.

1139
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:15.042
Okay. I'll get right on it.

1140
00:50:18.542 --> 00:50:22.375
Uh. tell me again why you're not
the one running the company?

1141
00:50:22.458 --> 00:50:25.208
I'll let you know as soon
as I figure it out.

1142
00:50:25.292 --> 00:50:27.500
Now I have a CEO to track down.

1143
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:32.250
[sighs]

1144
00:50:36.167 --> 00:50:38.292
[Natalie] Wow.
You came prepared.

1145
00:50:38.375 --> 00:50:39.625
[laughs]

1146
00:50:39.708 --> 00:50:41.250
Boy scout motto.

1147
00:50:42.625 --> 00:50:44.333
You were never a boy scout.

1148
00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:46.750
Maybe not. but I do believe
in the right wine

1149
00:50:46.833 --> 00:50:48.250
for the right occasion.

1150
00:50:48.375 --> 00:50:51.375
That's a $10.000 bottle of cab.

1151
00:50:51.458 --> 00:50:54.042
It's actually $15.0000.
[chuckles]

1152
00:50:54.125 --> 00:50:56.167
The owner's a family friend.
57 acres.

1153
00:50:56.208 --> 00:50:57.667
but only one is a cabernet.

1154
00:51:00.667 --> 00:51:01.917
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1155
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.500
[glasses clink]

1156
00:51:03.583 --> 00:51:06.500
[birds chirping]

1157
00:51:08.875 --> 00:51:10.375
Survey says?

1158
00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.042
Not bad.

1159
00:51:12.125 --> 00:51:13.958
-"Not bad"?
-[Natalie laughs]

1160
00:51:14.042 --> 00:51:16.583
I mean. I don't know
if it's worth $15.000.

1161
00:51:16.708 --> 00:51:17.750
Okay. Wow. really--

1162
00:51:17.833 --> 00:51:19.958
$11.000? Maybe $12.000?

1163
00:51:20.042 --> 00:51:22.083
You're just being a brat.

1164
00:51:22.167 --> 00:51:23.292
Well. what do you think?

1165
00:51:25.292 --> 00:51:27.500
I think it was one acre
very well spent.

1166
00:51:29.792 --> 00:51:31.750
Why are you so good to me.
Shane?

1167
00:51:31.833 --> 00:51:33.208
I don't know.

1168
00:51:33.292 --> 00:51:35.625
I was just asking myself
that same question.

1169
00:51:35.708 --> 00:51:38.125
And thoughts?

1170
00:51:38.208 --> 00:51:40.208
[Shane] Well. I can tell you
with near certainty

1171
00:51:40.208 --> 00:51:43.667
that you are the smartest.
most elegant.

1172
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.833
and beautiful woman
that I have ever bumped into

1173
00:51:45.917 --> 00:51:47.000
at the Eagle and Hare Pub.

1174
00:51:47.042 --> 00:51:49.125
[laughs]

1175
00:51:49.208 --> 00:51:51.583
Why. thank you. Shane.
I appreciate it.

1176
00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:56.750
[sighs] But seriously.

1177
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.750
Natalie King.

1178
00:52:08.875 --> 00:52:10.458
-[gasps]
-[Shane] I know.

1179
00:52:10.542 --> 00:52:11.833
I know it's absurdly fast
and we hardly know each other.

1180
00:52:11.917 --> 00:52:13.125
I know.

1181
00:52:13.208 --> 00:52:15.000
But I do believe in true love.

1182
00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:16.542
And from the moment
you rescued me

1183
00:52:16.667 --> 00:52:18.500
from that boring
business meeting.

1184
00:52:18.542 --> 00:52:19.917
I knew that you were the one.
And if you're not ready.

1185
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.292
-it's okay.
-Yes!

1186
00:52:22.375 --> 00:52:24.167
-Really? Yes?
-Yes! Yes. Shane!

1187
00:52:24.208 --> 00:52:26.375
-[Shane] Really?
-Yes. Yes! Yes! Yes!

1188
00:52:33.208 --> 00:52:36.417
[Shane] So. we have
some exciting news.

1189
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.958
[Natalie] We're getting married.

1190
00:52:38.042 --> 00:52:40.083
Wow. That is...

1191
00:52:40.167 --> 00:52:42.083
unexpected.

1192
00:52:42.167 --> 00:52:45.000
It was incredibly romantic.

1193
00:52:45.042 --> 00:52:46.708
He flew us up to Napa.

1194
00:52:46.708 --> 00:52:48.250
In the company jet. even.

1195
00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:50.167
Yes. Very generous.

1196
00:52:50.208 --> 00:52:51.833
You're the first person
that we told

1197
00:52:51.917 --> 00:52:54.417
because we wanted this moment
to just be ours for right now

1198
00:52:54.542 --> 00:52:56.125
until we set our posting.

1199
00:52:56.208 --> 00:52:57.917
I'm speechless.

1200
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.625
I should. um. I should probably
go tell my friends though.

1201
00:53:00.708 --> 00:53:02.250
[Shane] No. go ahead.
I wanna talk to my sister alone

1202
00:53:02.333 --> 00:53:04.125
-for a little bit.
-Okay.

1203
00:53:06.167 --> 00:53:09.125
Olivia. I have always wanted
a sister.

1204
00:53:10.958 --> 00:53:12.375
[laughs]

1205
00:53:16.292 --> 00:53:17.750
What's the matter with you?

1206
00:53:21.042 --> 00:53:22.625
"Wow! Shane. I'm so thrilled

1207
00:53:22.708 --> 00:53:24.500
that you found somebody
that makes you happy."

1208
00:53:24.625 --> 00:53:27.500
"Gee. golly whiz. brother.
you're finally settling down."

1209
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.042
You applaud your mistake? Bravo!

1210
00:53:30.125 --> 00:53:31.292
Encore!

1211
00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:32.625
You hardly know her.

1212
00:53:32.708 --> 00:53:33.917
That makes two of us.

1213
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.042
Is this because
of her suggestion

1214
00:53:35.125 --> 00:53:36.042
that you're threatened?

1215
00:53:36.125 --> 00:53:37.417
Please.

1216
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:38.625
It takes a lot more
than a pretty face

1217
00:53:38.708 --> 00:53:41.042
in a size zero dress
to intimidate me.

1218
00:53:41.125 --> 00:53:42.917
You know. I was actually
excited to tell you.

1219
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.292
[Olivia] And ruin the surprise
for when I saw it on page six?

1220
00:53:45.375 --> 00:53:47.208
[Shane] Is that what you think.
this is a publicity stunt?

1221
00:53:47.292 --> 00:53:49.292
Heir to a pharmaceutical empire

1222
00:53:49.375 --> 00:53:51.167
and Forbes' 27th
most eligible bachelor

1223
00:53:51.208 --> 00:53:53.000
announces an engagement

1224
00:53:53.083 --> 00:53:54.833
the same month
as his epic merger.

1225
00:53:54.875 --> 00:53:56.667
Tell me. you set a date yet

1226
00:53:56.708 --> 00:53:58.958
or you're waiting for your next
business triumph?

1227
00:53:59.042 --> 00:53:59.958
Okay.

1228
00:54:01.875 --> 00:54:02.958
Okay.

1229
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.667
I think I've heard enough.

1230
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:06.875
Shane.

1231
00:54:07.958 --> 00:54:08.917
Shane. wait.

1232
00:54:11.292 --> 00:54:12.917
I'm sorry.

1233
00:54:13.042 --> 00:54:14.292
That was harsh.

1234
00:54:15.333 --> 00:54:18.583
I just...I didn't expect this.

1235
00:54:18.667 --> 00:54:19.833
I reacted badly.

1236
00:54:21.333 --> 00:54:23.917
You really do love this girl.
don't you?

1237
00:54:24.042 --> 00:54:26.000
Yeah. I do.

1238
00:54:26.125 --> 00:54:28.833
And as much as I hate
to admit it. you have a point.

1239
00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:30.500
The idea of you
actually settling down.

1240
00:54:30.583 --> 00:54:32.375
as strange as that may sound.

1241
00:54:32.458 --> 00:54:33.958
might actually be a good thing.

1242
00:54:36.542 --> 00:54:39.167
Oh. what. we're hugging?

1243
00:54:39.208 --> 00:54:40.750
-[Olivia] Yes.
-Okay.

1244
00:54:42.292 --> 00:54:44.708
You're my brother
and I'll always love you.

1245
00:54:44.792 --> 00:54:47.333
I just want to make sure
you're doing the right thing.

1246
00:54:47.375 --> 00:54:49.625
Well. thank you
for looking out for me. mom.

1247
00:54:49.708 --> 00:54:51.000
Just trust me.

1248
00:54:51.083 --> 00:54:53.375
As long as she and I
are together.

1249
00:54:53.458 --> 00:54:56.667
"everything that we've dreamed
of will come to fruition."

1250
00:55:01.417 --> 00:55:03.292
We're not kids anymore.
I get it.

1251
00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:04.292
But that doesn't mean
you shouldn't check the pool

1252
00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:05.833
before you dive.

1253
00:55:05.875 --> 00:55:07.458
The company doesn't have people
who'd do this?

1254
00:55:07.542 --> 00:55:10.333
The company he runs.
absolutely. we do.

1255
00:55:10.375 --> 00:55:12.667
In other words.
we need it off the books.

1256
00:55:12.792 --> 00:55:13.875
Please.

1257
00:55:15.875 --> 00:55:17.875
You're sure you're doing this
for the right reasons?

1258
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.042
To make sure he's not being
taken advantage of.

1259
00:55:20.125 --> 00:55:22.875
And to make sure your part
of the inheritance is secure.

1260
00:55:22.958 --> 00:55:24.417
This isn't about money.

1261
00:55:24.542 --> 00:55:26.750
It's about him and making
sure he doesn't get hurt.

1262
00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.500
Olivia.
I have to ask you something.

1263
00:55:30.625 --> 00:55:33.292
Something I wouldn't ask
if we weren't friends.

1264
00:55:33.375 --> 00:55:35.792
Interrogation's your specialty.
not mine.

1265
00:55:38.708 --> 00:55:41.250
Are you sure it's this woman
you're worried about?

1266
00:55:41.333 --> 00:55:43.583
What's that supposed to mean?

1267
00:55:43.667 --> 00:55:44.917
It just seems like
you don't want your brother

1268
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.417
getting close to anyone.

1269
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.167
First the psychic.
now the girlfriend.

1270
00:55:48.250 --> 00:55:49.292
Fiancée.

1271
00:55:49.375 --> 00:55:50.875
He's a grown man. Olivia.

1272
00:55:50.958 --> 00:55:52.375
Eh. that's debatable.

1273
00:55:52.458 --> 00:55:54.333
There's no laws
against immaturity.

1274
00:55:54.375 --> 00:55:55.708
Please. Run her name.

1275
00:55:55.792 --> 00:55:57.500
See what comes up.

1276
00:55:57.583 --> 00:56:00.083
If it's nothing.
I'll never utter another word.

1277
00:56:04.042 --> 00:56:05.833
Give me her name.

1278
00:56:05.875 --> 00:56:06.958
Natalie.

1279
00:56:07.042 --> 00:56:08.708
Natalie King.

1280
00:56:13.792 --> 00:56:15.917
[classical music]

1281
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.333
[indistinct chatter]

1282
00:56:23.792 --> 00:56:26.500
So this is Martin.
he's our Chief Medical Officer.

1283
00:56:26.542 --> 00:56:28.375
And he was very instrumental

1284
00:56:28.458 --> 00:56:30.417
in pushing through
that Biosurgix deal.

1285
00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.458
Wow. Well. it is a pleasure
to meet you.

1286
00:56:32.542 --> 00:56:34.292
Oh. I hear you're a journalist.

1287
00:56:34.375 --> 00:56:35.625
Yes. I am.

1288
00:56:35.708 --> 00:56:37.750
-Uh. politics mostly.
-Hmm.

1289
00:56:37.833 --> 00:56:39.500
I'm actually finishing up
an exposé

1290
00:56:39.542 --> 00:56:41.750
on Proposition 29 right now.

1291
00:56:41.833 --> 00:56:43.708
Well. if you'd like the opinion
of a medical professional.

1292
00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:46.083
I'd be more than happy to speak
about it sometime.

1293
00:56:46.167 --> 00:56:47.625
That would be lovely.

1294
00:56:49.292 --> 00:56:50.375
-Well?
-[Jenna] I didn't even know

1295
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.750
he was dating someone.

1296
00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.292
He wasn't.

1297
00:56:53.375 --> 00:56:54.542
Seriously?

1298
00:56:54.625 --> 00:56:56.500
Not even Cupid could keep up.

1299
00:56:56.542 --> 00:56:58.000
[Jenna] So. how'd they meet?

1300
00:56:58.125 --> 00:56:59.375
[Olivia] Remember that night

1301
00:56:59.458 --> 00:57:01.000
we went to celebrate
the acquisition?

1302
00:57:01.042 --> 00:57:04.167
[Jenna] Unfortunately.
I had a headache for two days.

1303
00:57:04.208 --> 00:57:06.208
[laughs] Oh. no.

1304
00:57:06.333 --> 00:57:08.458
Apparently.
he spilled his drink on her.

1305
00:57:08.542 --> 00:57:11.000
the heavens parted
and the angels sang.

1306
00:57:11.083 --> 00:57:12.833
Wow.

1307
00:57:12.875 --> 00:57:14.792
To true love.

1308
00:57:14.875 --> 00:57:16.667
-Uh-hmm.
-[Jenna] And soiled dresses.

1309
00:57:16.708 --> 00:57:17.792
-[Olivia laughs]
-Thank you.

1310
00:57:17.875 --> 00:57:19.000
[Jenna] Yes.

1311
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.875
Excuse me.

1312
00:57:24.417 --> 00:57:27.542
[suspenseful music]

1313
00:57:43.542 --> 00:57:45.250
[Rita] For a moment.
I actually thought

1314
00:57:45.333 --> 00:57:47.083
you were inviting me to a party.

1315
00:57:47.208 --> 00:57:48.375
You're welcome to come in.

1316
00:57:48.458 --> 00:57:49.708
It's an open bar.

1317
00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.125
I'm on duty.

1318
00:57:51.208 --> 00:57:52.292
Did you run the name yet?

1319
00:57:52.375 --> 00:57:53.708
I do have other duties.
you know.

1320
00:57:53.833 --> 00:57:57.250
solving crimes.
protecting citizens.

1321
00:57:57.333 --> 00:57:58.417
Those the prints?

1322
00:57:58.542 --> 00:58:00.042
You can use this. right?

1323
00:58:00.125 --> 00:58:01.958
If they're readable.

1324
00:58:06.375 --> 00:58:08.083
If they come back
as Natalie King.

1325
00:58:08.167 --> 00:58:10.500
you owe me a drink.

1326
00:58:10.542 --> 00:58:12.042
If they come back
as Natalie King.

1327
00:58:12.125 --> 00:58:13.458
I'll keep the tab open.

1328
00:58:13.542 --> 00:58:16.333
[laughter]

1329
00:58:16.417 --> 00:58:17.833
How long do you think
it'll take?

1330
00:58:17.917 --> 00:58:20.125
As long as your brother's
been dating his fiancée.

1331
00:58:20.208 --> 00:58:21.583
Hmm.

1332
00:58:21.667 --> 00:58:23.583
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Okay.

1333
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:32.167
Thank you for coming. Martin.

1334
00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:34.375
-[Martin] All right.
-Bye.

1335
00:58:34.458 --> 00:58:35.833
[Jackson] Bye. guys.

1336
00:58:35.917 --> 00:58:37.458
Thanks. Jackson.
We'll see you in the office.

1337
00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.792
[sighs]

1338
00:58:43.375 --> 00:58:46.125
So what's the verdict?

1339
00:58:46.208 --> 00:58:47.500
[giggles]

1340
00:58:47.625 --> 00:58:50.667
Well. your CFO
does not trust me.

1341
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.833
your doctor felt threatened
the entire time.

1342
00:58:52.917 --> 00:58:56.958
and your sister also looked like
she had eaten some bad seafood.

1343
00:58:59.042 --> 00:59:00.750
Okay.

1344
00:59:00.833 --> 00:59:02.792
Other than that. how did you
like the play. Mrs. Lincoln?

1345
00:59:02.875 --> 00:59:05.833
[giggles] I liked it.
believe it or not. I did.

1346
00:59:08.375 --> 00:59:09.250
What's wrong?

1347
00:59:11.083 --> 00:59:11.958
Nothing.

1348
00:59:13.375 --> 00:59:14.500
Natalie.

1349
00:59:17.708 --> 00:59:19.875
It's just... I just...

1350
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.292
I wish my mother was here
to see all of this.

1351
00:59:23.875 --> 00:59:25.667
I would've loved
to have met her.

1352
00:59:27.667 --> 00:59:29.125
She would have loved you.

1353
00:59:32.458 --> 00:59:33.875
Well. I can tell you one thing.

1354
00:59:33.958 --> 00:59:37.125
she must have been
a remarkable woman.

1355
00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:38.667
Hmm?

1356
00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:40.792
'Cause she raised
a remarkable daughter.

1357
00:59:43.292 --> 00:59:44.667
Thank you.

1358
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:48.292
I'm really happy
that I get to spend

1359
00:59:48.375 --> 00:59:49.542
the rest of my life with you.

1360
00:59:51.375 --> 00:59:52.625
Me. too.

1361
00:59:54.542 --> 00:59:56.250
Janice Augustine.

1362
00:59:56.375 --> 00:59:57.833
You did it.

1363
00:59:57.917 --> 00:59:59.250
[Rita]
That name mean anything to you?

1364
00:59:59.375 --> 01:00:00.667
No.

1365
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:02.167
And there's no chance
it could be a mistake?

1366
01:00:02.208 --> 01:00:02.917
Prints don't lie.

1367
01:00:04.542 --> 01:00:06.625
-So now what?
-What do you mean?

1368
01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:08.542
-You'll charge her? Arrest her?
-Charge her with what?

1369
01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:09.833
False impersonation.

1370
01:00:09.917 --> 01:00:11.667
Fraudulent inducement to marry.

1371
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:12.833
Negligent misrepresentation.

1372
01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:14.875
First of all. Nancy Drew.

1373
01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:17.167
Janice Augustine doesn't have
a criminal record.

1374
01:00:17.292 --> 01:00:18.792
So it's her first time.

1375
01:00:18.875 --> 01:00:20.167
Second of all.
people change their names

1376
01:00:20.292 --> 01:00:21.917
for all kinds of reasons.

1377
01:00:22.042 --> 01:00:24.833
This isn't a smoking gun.
it's a lukewarm water pistol.

1378
01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:26.958
We're not talking about
slapping a pen name on a book.

1379
01:00:27.042 --> 01:00:29.333
She's doing this
to steal Shane's money.

1380
01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:31.083
[Rita] Even as it may.

1381
01:00:31.167 --> 01:00:33.375
being a gold digger is her
God-given right as an American.

1382
01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:35.125
[sighs]

1383
01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:37.417
People get married for
the wrong reasons all the time.

1384
01:00:37.542 --> 01:00:41.167
Trust me. I wish I could
prosecute them but I can't.

1385
01:00:41.292 --> 01:00:43.375
So there's nothing we can do?

1386
01:00:45.333 --> 01:00:47.250
You could go to Shane.

1387
01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:48.708
Tell him the truth.

1388
01:00:48.792 --> 01:00:50.375
Right. Because siblings love it

1389
01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:52.667
when you pry into the lives
of their significant others.

1390
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:55.417
One. he'll get angry
and say it doesn't matter.

1391
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.917
Two. he'll realize she's lying
and reconsider his relationship.

1392
01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:02.333
Three.
he'll never talk to me again.

1393
01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:04.292
Either way.
he'll know the truth.

1394
01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:08.792
You have no idea
how much he loves this woman.

1395
01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:11.708
Well. if he won't listen to you.

1396
01:01:11.792 --> 01:01:13.708
is there someone he would?

1397
01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:19.083
[water streaming]

1398
01:01:37.625 --> 01:01:39.792
You have his eyes.

1399
01:01:39.875 --> 01:01:41.333
You know who I am?

1400
01:01:41.417 --> 01:01:42.958
Of course.

1401
01:01:43.042 --> 01:01:45.500
I have to say.
this isn't what I expected.

1402
01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:47.333
What did you expect?

1403
01:01:47.417 --> 01:01:49.583
Bongs. Incense.

1404
01:01:49.667 --> 01:01:51.167
On back order.

1405
01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:54.500
Full disclosure.
I don't believe in any of this.

1406
01:01:54.583 --> 01:01:55.583
Your brother does.

1407
01:01:55.667 --> 01:01:57.250
Unfortunately.

1408
01:01:57.375 --> 01:01:58.500
What can I do for you?

1409
01:01:58.583 --> 01:02:00.750
You care about Shane. don't you?

1410
01:02:00.833 --> 01:02:02.792
I'd like to think
I foster strong relationships

1411
01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:04.333
with all of my clients.

1412
01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:06.125
Why?

1413
01:02:06.208 --> 01:02:08.792
Because he's about to make
a big mistake and I'm concerned.

1414
01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:10.292
I'm not a therapist.

1415
01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:11.750
But you have his ear.

1416
01:02:11.833 --> 01:02:13.708
I'm nothing more
than an interpreter. really.

1417
01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:16.583
In that case.
could you somehow interpret

1418
01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:19.667
some very important information
the next time he comes in here?

1419
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:21.917
And just what is it
you would like him to know?

1420
01:02:21.917 --> 01:02:24.042
That Natalie. the woman
he's planning to marry.

1421
01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:26.250
is not who she says she is.

1422
01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:27.583
I'm not sure I follow.

1423
01:02:27.667 --> 01:02:29.333
[Olivia]
Her real name is Janice.

1424
01:02:29.417 --> 01:02:30.917
Janice Augustine.

1425
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.708
Why don't you just tell him
yourself?

1426
01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:34.583
'Cause I know
he won't believe me.

1427
01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:36.167
Because he trusts you.

1428
01:02:36.208 --> 01:02:38.000
You're absolutely certain
of this?

1429
01:02:38.083 --> 01:02:39.542
A friend with the police
ran her prints for me

1430
01:02:39.667 --> 01:02:40.625
and confirmed it.

1431
01:02:40.708 --> 01:02:43.250
[sighs]

1432
01:02:45.042 --> 01:02:46.333
He does love her. you know.

1433
01:02:46.375 --> 01:02:49.125
[Olivia]
He loves Natalie. Not Janice.

1434
01:02:49.125 --> 01:02:51.375
Please. Before it's too late.

1435
01:02:51.458 --> 01:02:53.125
For my brother's sake.

1436
01:02:54.917 --> 01:02:56.417
I'll see what I can do.

1437
01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:06.292
[ominous music]

1438
01:03:08.542 --> 01:03:09.833
[gasps]

1439
01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.833
How did you get in here?

1440
01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:14.375
Olivia knows.

1441
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:18.000
[scoffs] Knows what?

1442
01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:19.500
[Maya] Who you are. Janice.

1443
01:03:19.542 --> 01:03:20.667
How?

1444
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:22.333
Your fingerprints.

1445
01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:23.833
[scoffs]

1446
01:03:23.917 --> 01:03:27.042
That nosy bitch.

1447
01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:29.292
You know what we have to do.

1448
01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:32.542
That's going to be a problem.

1449
01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:37.000
It wasn't a problem for
Irving Polk or Tyler Armstrong.

1450
01:03:37.083 --> 01:03:40.125
An old man?
A club kid with a drug problem?

1451
01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:42.125
Olivia is a young
and healthy woman.

1452
01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:43.917
Healthy people die all the time.

1453
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.833
car accidents.
sudden disease. suicide.

1454
01:03:46.958 --> 01:03:48.625
This is not
what I signed up for.

1455
01:03:48.708 --> 01:03:49.792
But it's where we are.

1456
01:03:51.167 --> 01:03:52.833
We don't have a choice. Janice.

1457
01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:54.042
It's her or us.

1458
01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.917
[siren wailing]

1459
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.083

[exhales deeply]

1462
01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:16.000
Working late?

1463
01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:18.833
Oh. You need to finish
evaluating these KPI reports

1464
01:04:18.917 --> 01:04:21.083
before the strategy meeting
in the morning.

1465
01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:22.750
[yawns]

1466
01:04:22.833 --> 01:04:24.000
I left some coffee for you
in the break room.

1467
01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:25.833
-[Olivia] Oh. thank you.
-Night.

1468
01:04:25.917 --> 01:04:27.208
[Olivia] Night.

1469
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:31.917
[yawns] Ooh.

1470
01:04:41.458 --> 01:04:42.417

1473
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.875
[groans] Great.

[suspenseful music]

1477
01:05:33.583 --> 01:05:35.125
Is someone there?

1478
01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.375
[sighs]

1479
01:05:59.542 --> 01:06:01.292

[dramatic music]

1484
01:06:42.167 --> 01:06:44.417
I'm sorry. We're not open yet.

1485
01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:47.250
Oh. I'm not here for...

1486
01:06:47.375 --> 01:06:48.958
wait.

1487
01:06:49.042 --> 01:06:50.917
You're Arabella Prescott.

1488
01:06:51.042 --> 01:06:52.958
Oh. big fan.

1489
01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:53.917
Love the show.

1490
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.542
Thank you.

1491
01:06:55.667 --> 01:06:57.208
I gotta ask.

1492
01:06:57.292 --> 01:07:00.333
All that psychic stuff on there.

1493
01:07:00.417 --> 01:07:02.417
-is that real?
-Of course.

1494
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.250
I mean. they do their
little editing tricks

1495
01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:06.583
to make things
seem more dramatic.

1496
01:07:06.667 --> 01:07:09.333
but I take my calling
very seriously.

1497
01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:12.500
Is there something
I can help you with. Detective?

1498
01:07:15.042 --> 01:07:16.208
You got me.

1499
01:07:16.292 --> 01:07:18.750
Occupational hazard.

1500
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:22.667
Maybe I should just sit back
and let you question yourself.

1501
01:07:23.792 --> 01:07:25.417
You're funny.

1502
01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:28.542
I was actually looking
for Maya Priestley.

1503
01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:30.167
Oh. she's out today.

1504
01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:31.792
But perhaps I can help you.

1505
01:07:31.875 --> 01:07:33.833
I just have a few questions
for her

1506
01:07:33.958 --> 01:07:35.958
about a reading
she did recently.

1507
01:07:36.042 --> 01:07:37.750
A reading?

1508
01:07:37.833 --> 01:07:39.167
From Maya?

1509
01:07:39.208 --> 01:07:40.583
I have reason to believe

1510
01:07:40.667 --> 01:07:42.417
there's a connection
to a case I'm working on.

1511
01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.500
Is it possible
you got the names mixed up?

1512
01:07:46.583 --> 01:07:48.333
Why do you ask?

1513
01:07:48.417 --> 01:07:50.083
I require all my Tarot readers

1514
01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:52.000
to be certified
with the association

1515
01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:54.750
and Maya's only been here
a few months.

1516
01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.958
My mistake.

1517
01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:02.000
I might have gotten
my information mixed up.

1518
01:08:02.042 --> 01:08:03.583
Understandable.

1519
01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:05.292
But if there's anything else
you'd like to know.

1520
01:08:05.375 --> 01:08:06.708
I'd be happy to help.

1521
01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:11.542
Is there anything
you could tell me about Maya?

1522
01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:13.042
Such as?

1523
01:08:14.042 --> 01:08:15.458
You said
she's only been with you

1524
01:08:15.542 --> 01:08:17.500
-a few months.
-That's right.

1525
01:08:17.542 --> 01:08:19.292
Did you happen to do
a background check

1526
01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:23.417
or do you... just... know?

1527
01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.375
I honestly don't remember.

1528
01:08:26.458 --> 01:08:28.917
But what I can tell you
is in time she's been here.

1529
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.292
she's been a model employee.

1530
01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:34.708
Polite. punctual. team player.

1531
01:08:37.375 --> 01:08:38.542
I appreciate you
taking the time.

1532
01:08:38.625 --> 01:08:39.750
Uh-hmm.

1533
01:08:41.792 --> 01:08:42.792
Oh. wait.

1534
01:08:45.375 --> 01:08:47.333
Always happy to meet a fan.

1535
01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.500
-Thank you.
-[Arabella] Uh-hmm.

1536
01:08:58.208 --> 01:09:01.375
Olivia. it's Rita.
Give me a call.

1537
01:09:01.458 --> 01:09:03.250
I need to talk to you
about something.

-[helicopter whirring]
-[siren wailing]

1539
01:09:10.875 --> 01:09:12.333
Uh. Olivia? Where...

1540
01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:14.167
-what room? Where?
-Right through there.

1541
01:09:16.667 --> 01:09:18.750
I'm all right. I'm okay.

1542
01:09:18.833 --> 01:09:21.042
They stitched me up
and wanna give me a CT scan

1543
01:09:21.125 --> 01:09:23.167
just to make sure
my skull isn't fractured.

1544
01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:25.250
After that.
they say I can go home.

1545
01:09:25.333 --> 01:09:27.250
Uh. did you see who did this?

1546
01:09:27.333 --> 01:09:28.708
-Sit down.
-Are the police...

1547
01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:31.125
-are they looking them?
-Shane. please.

1548
01:09:36.375 --> 01:09:37.958
[woman on PA] Dr. Kravitz.

1549
01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:39.625
you have a visitor
in the main lobby.

1550
01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:43.250
Dr. Kravitz. a visitor
in the main lobby.

1551
01:09:43.333 --> 01:09:45.208
I have something to tell you.

1552
01:09:45.333 --> 01:09:48.042
You're not gonna wanna hear it.
but I need you to listen.

1553
01:09:48.167 --> 01:09:49.792
Yeah. I'm here.
I'm listening. What?

1554
01:09:51.917 --> 01:09:53.333
Natalie's involved.

1555
01:09:54.583 --> 01:09:56.667
You could've just said
you didn't like her.

1556
01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:59.000
Look. I'm aware
I can be overprotective

1557
01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
but I had a feeling.

1558
01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:02.333
So I had Rita
run her fingerprints.

1559
01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:04.375
You ran Natalie's fingerprints?

1560
01:10:04.458 --> 01:10:06.833
[Olivia] She's not
who she says she is.

1561
01:10:06.833 --> 01:10:08.875
Great. I'll bite. Who is she?

1562
01:10:08.958 --> 01:10:11.292
Her name is Janice Augustine.

1563
01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:16.792
-You're being serious.
-[Olivia] Yes.

1564
01:10:16.875 --> 01:10:18.583
I'm not saying she's the one
who actually hit me.

1565
01:10:18.708 --> 01:10:21.083
but she had something
to do with it.

1566
01:10:21.167 --> 01:10:22.333
I know it.

1567
01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:23.708
Wait. Augustine.

Uh. I have to go.

1571

1572
01:10:35.458 --> 01:10:37.167
Uh. no. I'll call you.

1573
01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:39.792
-I'll call you.
-Shane? Shane!

1574
01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:43.333
So yeah [indistinct] over.

1575
01:10:43.458 --> 01:10:45.000
-You're here early.
-Do me a favor.

1576
01:10:45.125 --> 01:10:46.542
Have legal pull
the Tranquilify files.

1577

-Which ones?
-All of them.

1578
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.042
You know how many there are.

1579
01:10:49.125 --> 01:10:50.833
Tell the front to hold my calls.

1580
01:10:50.917 --> 01:10:52.000
Okay.

She's been sick for a while.

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.042
-Is she on medication?
-[Dave] Tranquilify.

1588
01:12:00.042 --> 01:12:01.500
Clear.

1589
01:12:01.542 --> 01:12:03.833
It tore my family apart.

1590
01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:05.333
Calling it.

1591
01:12:05.417 --> 01:12:06.708
[Jackson] Look into the patent
infringement...

1592
01:12:06.792 --> 01:12:07.833
oh. wait a minute.

1593
01:12:09.042 --> 01:12:10.292
I'll catch up to you.

1594
01:12:15.167 --> 01:12:16.750
You were never supposed to know.

1595
01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.833
[Shane] That. what. dad's rush
to market actually kill people?

1596
01:12:21.917 --> 01:12:24.042
Yeah. A few isolated cases.

1597
01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:26.417
-You call this a few?
-We perfected the formula.

1598
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.417
Yeah. After people died.

1599
01:12:31.083 --> 01:12:32.583
What would you say if I told you

1600
01:12:32.667 --> 01:12:34.250
there was a medicine
on the market

1601
01:12:34.375 --> 01:12:36.167
that helped billions

1602
01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.917
that killed 3.000 to 4.000
people each and every year?

1603
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:42.500
That's aspirin. Shane.

1604
01:12:43.875 --> 01:12:47.208
And now that you know that.
should people stop taking it?

1605
01:12:47.292 --> 01:12:49.750
Should pharmacies pull it off
the shelves?

1606
01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:50.875
No. of course not.

1607
01:12:50.958 --> 01:12:52.250
[Jackson] Exactly.

1608
01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:54.333
Your father did
what he had to do

1609
01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:56.000
to protect this company

1610
01:12:56.083 --> 01:12:58.833
and protect a product
that helped a lot of people.

1611
01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:01.250
Do you think the hospital would
dedicate a wing in his name

1612
01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:02.958
if they knew?

1613
01:13:03.042 --> 01:13:05.458
Do you think senators and mayors
would line up

1614
01:13:05.542 --> 01:13:06.875
to show their support?

1615
01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:08.500
He was just such a bully.

1616
01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:10.042
He was a businessman.

1617
01:13:10.125 --> 01:13:11.667
No. he was a bully.

1618
01:13:13.042 --> 01:13:14.583
I'm looking at what he did
to the people

1619
01:13:14.667 --> 01:13:16.042
who spoke out against him.
Jackson.

1620
01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.500
He destroyed their lives.

1621
01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:23.333
You know. sometimes
when you sit in that chair.

1622
01:13:23.375 --> 01:13:25.292
you have to make decisions

1623
01:13:25.375 --> 01:13:26.500
in the best interest
of the company.

1624
01:13:26.583 --> 01:13:29.000
something bigger than yourself.

1625
01:13:29.083 --> 01:13:31.625
Did people die? Yeah. they did.

1626
01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:33.500
So that billions could be saved.

1627
01:13:35.792 --> 01:13:37.625
Now. I'm gonna ask you. Shane.

1628
01:13:37.708 --> 01:13:39.625
now that you're sitting
in your father's chair.

1629
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.500
what would you have done?

1630
01:13:44.542 --> 01:13:45.917
Just chew on that.

1631
01:13:59.417 --> 01:14:02.875
[door opening. shuts]

1632
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.500
[Natalie] Sweetheart?

1633
01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:05.917
Yeah. I'm in here.

1634
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.667
I stopped by the office but
they told me that you were here.

1635
01:14:11.542 --> 01:14:13.083
[Shane] Stop.

1636
01:14:13.208 --> 01:14:15.292
Have a seat.

1637
01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:17.375
Darling. what's wrong?

1638
01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:18.667
Is it the company?

1639
01:14:21.042 --> 01:14:22.625
Yeah. something like that.

1640
01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.417
I don't understand.

1641
01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.208
I think you understand
perfectly. Janice.

1642
01:14:27.292 --> 01:14:28.500
I'm sorry?

1643
01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:33.375
You know. when I was a kid.
I remember

1644
01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:35.667
hearing my father talk
about this case.

1645
01:14:35.708 --> 01:14:38.333
I didn't know the specifics
of course

1646
01:14:38.375 --> 01:14:41.667
but I'll never forget
the name Augustine.

1647
01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:42.833
So...

1648
01:14:44.167 --> 01:14:45.500
I guess it does look
like my family left a footnote

1649
01:14:45.625 --> 01:14:47.375
in the old Settel biography.

1650
01:14:47.542 --> 01:14:48.708
I'm honored.

1651
01:14:50.708 --> 01:14:51.917
[sighs]

1652
01:14:53.417 --> 01:14:55.958
You know what my dad did.
it was inexcusable.

1653
01:14:56.042 --> 01:14:57.625
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

1654
01:14:57.708 --> 01:14:59.167
[Shane] You're the fraud.
You tell me.

1655
01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:01.500
Do you know how many people
Tranquilify has helped?

1656
01:15:01.583 --> 01:15:03.375
-How many lives my father saved?
-[Natalie] Yeah.

1657
01:15:03.458 --> 01:15:04.750
I'm sure those grieving
families light a candle

1658
01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.708
-for him every night.
-That's not fair.

1659
01:15:08.333 --> 01:15:09.917
You know what's not fair?

1660
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.292
Your company put a lien
on my father's paychecks.

1661
01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:15.625
$30.000 a year.

1662
01:15:15.708 --> 01:15:18.542
That painting
that costs more than that.

1663
01:15:18.667 --> 01:15:20.875
Great. So what?
You want the painting?

1664
01:15:20.958 --> 01:15:22.208
Take the painting.

1665
01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:26.208
Because you're right.
it's terrible. it's disgusting.

1666
01:15:26.292 --> 01:15:28.000
Just cut me some slack.
all right?

1667
01:15:28.083 --> 01:15:30.667
Because I just I found that
the man I grew up idolizing

1668
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:32.333
isn't whom I thought he was.

1669
01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:34.500
I didn't get the chance.

1670
01:15:34.542 --> 01:15:37.625
My father drank himself
to death.

1671
01:15:37.708 --> 01:15:39.708
Didn't put that in your file.
did they?

1672
01:15:43.458 --> 01:15:45.250
No. I...

1673
01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:47.417
Janice. I had no idea.

1674
01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.625
Yeah. it was a little late
for regrets.

1675
01:15:49.708 --> 01:15:52.500
Exactly. So why now?

1676
01:15:52.583 --> 01:15:56.833
Because after everything
that my family went through.

1677
01:15:56.958 --> 01:15:58.917
my sister and I
couldn't just stand back

1678
01:15:59.042 --> 01:16:00.500
and watch
while you and your sister

1679
01:16:00.583 --> 01:16:02.375
literally inherent billions

1680
01:16:02.458 --> 01:16:03.500
from the company
that destroyed us.

1681
01:16:03.625 --> 01:16:05.083
Olivia and I didn't know.

1682
01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:06.333
You expect me to believe that?

1683
01:16:06.417 --> 01:16:07.833
Yes. because it's the truth.

1684
01:16:07.917 --> 01:16:10.000
You're the CEO
of the company. Shane.

1685
01:16:11.125 --> 01:16:12.542
I'm the CEO.

1686
01:16:14.542 --> 01:16:16.792
but I'm the CEO.
Is that what this is about?

1687
01:16:16.875 --> 01:16:18.792
Is that the plan?
That you were gonna. what?

1688
01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:22.292
Marry me and then kill me?

1689
01:16:22.375 --> 01:16:24.000
And then inherit my money.

1690
01:16:25.542 --> 01:16:27.000
Only seems fair.

1691
01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:32.083
Okay. Then. go ahead.

1692
01:16:33.333 --> 01:16:35.292
Go for it.
Take your shot. Janice.

1693
01:16:35.375 --> 01:16:36.958
You'd be doing us both a favor.

1694
01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:53.250
[door shuts]

1695
01:16:57.333 --> 01:16:58.583
[siren wailing]

1696
01:16:58.583 --> 01:17:01.542
[indistinct PA announcement]

1697
01:17:01.667 --> 01:17:03.833
I must be the most popular
patient on this floor.

1698
01:17:03.917 --> 01:17:06.167
-How are you?
-Stir-crazy.

1699
01:17:06.292 --> 01:17:08.458
-I just wanna go home.
-What did they say?

1700
01:17:08.542 --> 01:17:10.500
CT was fine. No hemorrhaging.

1701
01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:12.625
I'm glad.

1702
01:17:12.708 --> 01:17:15.417
-Could have been a lot worse.
-Yeah.

1703
01:17:15.542 --> 01:17:18.833
I want you to know. we're going
to find out who did this to you.

1704
01:17:18.958 --> 01:17:20.625
I already know
its Janice Augustine.

1705
01:17:20.708 --> 01:17:22.875
-Olivia.
-I know you don't believe me.

1706
01:17:22.958 --> 01:17:25.458
but listen. I was on my way
to the break room

1707
01:17:25.542 --> 01:17:27.833
-and I--
-No. you listen.

1708
01:17:27.958 --> 01:17:29.708
After we spoke. I paid a visit

1709
01:17:29.792 --> 01:17:32.167
-to that psychic you mentioned.
-And?

1710
01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:34.667
She's not even supposed
to be doing readings.

1711
01:17:34.792 --> 01:17:36.708
-What?
-[Rita] That got me thinking

1712
01:17:36.792 --> 01:17:40.042
about the one piece of advice
that actually paid off.

1713
01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:41.917
Irving Polk.

1714
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.625
So I ran some fingerprints
they pulled from his house.

1715
01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:46.167
Janice Augustine?

1716
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.500
Lizzy Augustine.

1717
01:17:48.583 --> 01:17:49.833
They're sisters.

1718
01:17:49.917 --> 01:17:52.583
-Wait. what?
-There's more.

1719
01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:54.667
Their mother died
when they were young.

1720
01:17:54.708 --> 01:17:57.042
Apparently she had a fatal
reaction to some medicine

1721
01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:58.875
and they sued
the drug manufacturer.

1722
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.042
Wanna take a guess
which company that was?

1723
01:18:03.542 --> 01:18:04.625
-Olivia.
-We have to go

1724
01:18:04.708 --> 01:18:06.167
to Shane's house now.

1725
01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:09.167
[dramatic music]

1726
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.208
Come on. come on. pick up.

1727
01:18:32.292 --> 01:18:34.250
Don't worry. Olivia.
we're gonna get there.

1728
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:51.542
-Hey. Olivia.
-[Olivia] Shane. Oh. thank God.

1729
01:18:51.667 --> 01:18:54.000
Listen to me. I need to tell you
something very important.

1730
01:18:54.083 --> 01:18:55.333
[grunts. groans]

1731
01:18:55.375 --> 01:18:56.292
[Olivia] Shane.

1732
01:18:57.667 --> 01:18:59.417
Shane.

1733
01:18:59.542 --> 01:19:00.958
Shane.

1734
01:19:01.875 --> 01:19:04.167
Something's wrong.

1735
01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:06.875
Shane. we don't have time
for a final reading.

1736
01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:10.042
Well. don't worry.
I brought the card anyways.

1737
01:19:11.792 --> 01:19:14.417
I can't believe
how gullible you were.

1738
01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:16.417
Your father would be disgusted.

1739
01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:18.917
At least he had the guts
to follow his instincts

1740
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.375
even if it meant killing
innocent people like my mother.

1741
01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:24.458
I'm sorry. We didn't know.

1742
01:19:24.542 --> 01:19:25.625
-It was--
-[Maya] Seriously?

1743
01:19:25.708 --> 01:19:27.583
What would you have done?

1744
01:19:27.667 --> 01:19:31.375
Turned him in.
given up your fortune?

1745
01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:33.750
I don't think so. You know why?

1746
01:19:33.833 --> 01:19:36.875
Because deep down
you were just like him.

1747
01:19:36.958 --> 01:19:38.417
you and your
whole corrupt family.

1748
01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:46.250
You know what the best part
about this is?

1749
01:19:47.333 --> 01:19:50.667
Before you die. I'm gonna
let you in on another secret.

1750
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.708
When your sister leaves
that hospital.

1751
01:19:52.792 --> 01:19:54.708
she's gonna die too.

1752
01:19:54.792 --> 01:19:57.875
[grunts. heavy breathing]

1753
01:20:04.375 --> 01:20:06.167
Time's up. Shane.

1754
01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:08.458
How much longer do you think
till you lose consciousness?

1755
01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:10.417
One minute? Two?

1756
01:20:11.708 --> 01:20:14.833
Do you really think that's
long enough to outrun fate?

1757
01:20:14.917 --> 01:20:16.167
Time's up.

1758
01:20:28.917 --> 01:20:30.833
-Stay here.
-My brother's in trouble.

1759
01:20:30.875 --> 01:20:32.458
I'll handle it.

1760
01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:43.875
Shane?

1761
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.167
It's Detective Halsey.

1762
01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.458
Shane?

1763
01:21:03.083 --> 01:21:05.333
[Olivia] Where's Shane?

1764
01:21:05.417 --> 01:21:07.583
Olivia. you're okay.

1765
01:21:07.667 --> 01:21:09.542
Funny thing
about being a Settel.

1766
01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:11.250
you grow up with thick skin.

1767
01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:12.542
Where is he?

1768
01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:14.667
-He's inside.
-With Maya?

1769
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:17.000
Look. you have to understand.
I would never hurt you.

1770
01:21:17.042 --> 01:21:18.708
That was all my sister.

1771
01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:20.250
Do you always have a conscience

1772
01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:21.833
or just when your back's
against the wall?

1773
01:21:21.958 --> 01:21:23.667
Really. None of this is my idea.

1774
01:21:23.792 --> 01:21:25.625
Yet. here you are

1775
01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:27.000
in my brother's driveway.

1776
01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:28.750
in front of your getaway car.

1777
01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:31.292
Okay. I'll go. I'll go.

1778
01:21:40.667 --> 01:21:42.375
Olivia?

1779
01:21:42.458 --> 01:21:44.042
Olivia. where are you?

1780
01:21:48.167 --> 01:21:49.958
Funny thing about the Settels.

1781
01:21:50.958 --> 01:21:53.000
when there's trouble.
they're never around.

1782
01:21:56.208 --> 01:21:57.875
[Olivia] I'm right here. bitch.

1783
01:22:17.708 --> 01:22:19.625
Shane?

1784
01:22:19.708 --> 01:22:21.042
Shane?

1785
01:22:22.333 --> 01:22:23.250
Shane.

1786
01:22:24.292 --> 01:22:25.917
-What happened?
-Detective.

1787
01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:27.167
-Are you okay?
-You need to watch...

1788
01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:28.583
-Shane. you hurt.
-Yeah.

1789
01:22:28.667 --> 01:22:29.625
She's right behind you.

1790
01:22:32.917 --> 01:22:34.583
[Rita] Drop it. Lizzy.

1791
01:22:34.667 --> 01:22:37.292
[grunting]

1792
01:22:49.667 --> 01:22:51.208
[Shane breathing heavily]

1793
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.458
Shane?

1794
01:22:54.583 --> 01:22:56.000
Olivia.

1795
01:22:56.083 --> 01:22:57.917
-Olivia.
-Are you okay?

1796
01:23:00.042 --> 01:23:02.000
-You hurt?
-I'm all right.

1797
01:23:02.042 --> 01:23:03.333
-[Olivia] Are you okay?
-[Shane] I'm okay.

1798
01:23:03.417 --> 01:23:06.333
[dramatic music]

1799
01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:19.208
Hmm.

1800
01:23:20.417 --> 01:23:22.000
Nice suit.

1801
01:23:22.083 --> 01:23:23.542
Thank you. I figure
if I'm gonna keep working.

1802
01:23:23.667 --> 01:23:24.958
I might as well dress the part.

1803
01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:26.542
Besides. it goes with the sling.

1804
01:23:26.667 --> 01:23:27.833
Fashion accessory of the year.

1805
01:23:27.875 --> 01:23:29.375
Yes. it is.

1806
01:23:30.333 --> 01:23:32.667
-How's Rita?
-Fine. Back at work.

1807
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:34.000
I told her
you were healing nicely

1808
01:23:34.083 --> 01:23:35.375
and she sends her best wishes.

1809
01:23:35.458 --> 01:23:37.292
Good. What about the sisters?

1810
01:23:37.375 --> 01:23:40.250
Recovering
but still refusing to talk.

1811
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:42.375
We could always try tarot cards.

1812
01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:44.333
What's the card
for a first degree murder?

1813
01:23:44.417 --> 01:23:47.708
-Justice.
-With a double murder charge.

1814
01:23:47.792 --> 01:23:49.833
It's gonna be a while
before they do another reading.

1815
01:23:49.875 --> 01:23:51.583
Good. That's good.

1816
01:23:52.667 --> 01:23:53.833
Yeah.

1817
01:23:53.917 --> 01:23:55.333
Are you thinking about dad?

1818
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.792
Yeah. Yeah. a little bit.

1819
01:23:58.875 --> 01:24:01.083
It's just hard to believe he was
capable of doing such a thing.

1820
01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:03.458
Smart man once told me
we need to break the mold.

1821
01:24:05.875 --> 01:24:07.458
Smart. huh?

1822
01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.083
It's a new day
for Settel Pharmaceuticals.

1823
01:24:09.167 --> 01:24:10.458
Apparently it is.

1824
01:24:10.542 --> 01:24:12.167
It's also a new day
for a new leader.

1825
01:24:12.208 --> 01:24:14.792
You'll do a better job.
I know it.

1826
01:24:14.875 --> 01:24:16.333
Not me.

1827
01:24:18.042 --> 01:24:19.833
You deserve it. Olivia.
and you've deserved it

1828
01:24:19.958 --> 01:24:22.542
-from the beginning.
-What are you saying?

1829
01:24:22.625 --> 01:24:24.750
In an hour. the board
is going to convene

1830
01:24:24.833 --> 01:24:26.417
and I'm going to announce
that I'm stepping down

1831
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:29.125
so that you can take over
as CEO.

1832
01:24:29.208 --> 01:24:32.042
-Shane. you can't.
-I can't? Says who?

1833
01:24:32.125 --> 01:24:34.333
The CEO? Oh. wait. I forgot.
That's me.

1834
01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.125
At least
until the board signs off.

1835
01:24:37.208 --> 01:24:38.583
my decision is final.

1836
01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:40.750
Thank you.

1837
01:24:41.958 --> 01:24:43.750
Now. we really should get going.

1838
01:24:43.833 --> 01:24:44.833
You never know about traffic.

1839
01:24:44.917 --> 01:24:46.375
You never know.

1840
01:24:50.375 --> 01:24:54.000
Besides. you wouldn't want
to keep the board waiting.

1841
01:24:54.125 --> 01:24:56.125
Plus I have a corner office
to redecorate.

1842
01:24:56.208 --> 01:24:57.583
Hey. I decorated that office.

1843
01:24:57.708 --> 01:25:00.042
Exactly. [chuckles]

1844
01:25:01.958 --> 01:25:05.042
[dramatic music]

1845
01:25:14.958 --> 01:25:17.750
[dramatic music]
