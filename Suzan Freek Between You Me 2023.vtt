00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.920
<i>Contrast.</i>

4
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.480
<i>That we went</i>
<i>from two years of corona standstill</i>

5
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.680
<i>suddenly to this.</i>

6
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.560
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Which made it almost too much at times.</i>

7
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.440
<i>But now when I think back in retrospect.</i>
<i>it really was crazy.</i>

8
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.400
Beautiful. isn't it?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.400
UNITED STATES. SEPTEMBER 2022

10
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.520
To us it feels short. But secretly
we've been playing for a long time.

11
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.120
The first ten years.
we weren't really Suzan & Freek. but…

12
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.880
-It was there though.
-Yeah.

13
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.720
Suus studied in Delft.

14
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.160
I went to Delft a few times a week.

15
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.680
I had my guitar and a camera. That's where
we started recording <i>The Minutes.</i>

16
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.600
When we'd play till five in the morning.
we had to pack up ourselves.

17
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.240
I think the best way to keep going
is to stay true to yourself

18
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.080
because it's easy
to get dragged into all the fuss.

19
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.840
If a lot of people say you're fantastic.

20
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.120
you also believe you're fantastic.

21
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.360
Luckily. we have each other
to share it a bit.

22
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.040
I want to keep my boundaries
and be okay with myself.

23
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.360
I still want to identify
with my friends and those around me.

24
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.320
So that I don't…

25
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.560
I want to stay the same.

26
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.240
-And I'm grateful for you.
-Yeah?

27
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.040
-We did well together. didn't we?
-Yes. we did.

28
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.240
You often say. "I really like
being Suzan from Suzan & Freek."

29
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.160
I say it a lot.

30
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.520
And I really like
being Freek from Suzan & Freek.

31
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.640
That's what I'm most grateful for.

32
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.040
-That we could do it together.
-Yes. me too.

33
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.920
I think it's great too.

34
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.200
<i>Ladies and gentlemen. boys and girls.</i>
<i>Suzan & Freek!</i>

35
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.000
I think Suzan & Freek are the biggest act
in the Netherlands right now.

36
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.440
<i>It seemed like all the special things</i>
<i>you can experience as an artist</i>

37
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.840
<i>were all planned in one month.</i>

38
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.840
<i>I just want</i>
<i>what's private to remain private.</i>

39
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.880
<i>That's the last piece of us</i>
<i>that still belongs to us.</i>

40
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.920
<i>We've become entertainers.</i>

41
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.040
It's remarkable that they're
two down-to-earth people from Achterhoek

42
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.160
who have gained national fame.

43
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.680
Proud.

44
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.560
Yes. I think we did dream of this.

45
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.480
SUZAN & FREEK
BETWEEN YOU AND ME

46
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.320
<i>We're in Berlin.</i>

47
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.120
<i>And on this square.</i>

48
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.640
<i>I asked a very special question.</i>

49
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.440
<i>And what did she say?</i>

50
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.680
<i>Yes!</i>

51
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.600
<i>-We're getting married.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

52
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.280
-<i>Apart from our family. no one knows.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

53
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.960
<i>We'll tell everyone soon.</i>

54
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.280
THE ACHTERHOEK
ZWARTE CROSS PRE-PARTY WITH SUZAN & FREEK

55
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360
JULY 2022

56
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.040
-Hey. brother. All good?
-Yo.

57
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.880
-Sure.
-Yeah. good race?

58
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.640
I think the party is great.
but I hope everyone likes it.

59
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.840
-Hey. Mother.
-Did you finish?

60
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.200
-Yes. of course. Tomorrow--
-A hair.

61
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.960
-Rik and Rob weren't allowed to drive.
-Blood alcohol too high.

62
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.120
-We're watching it.
-Isn't it crazy here?

63
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.640
Yes. it's crazy here.
because I still feel like the old Suzan.

64
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.600
It's a bit stressful with all the people.

65
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.200
Then I have to get on that stage.
I think it's more stressful here.

66
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.840
-Things converge here.
-Yes.

67
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
-Nice. right? In Berlin.
-When did it happen?

68
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.120
Nice. right? I was totally surprised.

69
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.040
We were in Berlin on Monday morning.

70
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.400
He said. "What a coincidence.
Coldplay is playing."

71
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.520
"The first concert we went to together."

72
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.160
-That's our style of music.
-I'm getting goosebumps.

73
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.320
He said. "Oh. what a shame.
Or maybe it's not a coincidence."

74
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.080
"I've got great VIP tickets.
The best seats."

75
00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.160
"To celebrate love with you.
we're going tonight." Sweet. right?

76
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.680
-Shall we start?
-All good.

77
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.360
-Do it?
-Yes. it's good.

78
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.000
-Do you dare? I don't.
-Yeah.

79
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.080
-Will you do the directing?
-No.

80
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.800
You have to say it.
You have to talk loudly.

81
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.520
You can do it.

82
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.720
-Speech.
-No.

83
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.320
Little speech.

84
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400
Hello. everyone.

85
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.960
This is uncomfortable.
but we're going to do it anyway.

86
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.560
At least say "hi" to everyone.

87
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.080
Great that you're all here
at our Zwarte Cross pre-party.

88
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.360
Since we probably won't see you
at the festival later.

89
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.880
we thought we'd have a little party here.

90
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.360
And also a little pre-party
for something else

91
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.440
because I got down on one knee
in Berlin for Suus.

92
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.120
How great.

93
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.840
Congratulations.

94
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.920
"Don't you get fed up with each other?"

95
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.160
"Which one wears the pants?"

96
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.640
"Do you ever argue? Oh. what about?"

97
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.040
They always ask which characteristics

98
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.160
of Suus or mine the other doesn't like.

99
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.840
To which I still
need to find the perfect answer.

100
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.800
but it always comes down to.
"No. we really like it…"

101
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.680
It's always the same question.

102
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.280
SIX MONTHS EARLIER
START OF THE CLUB TOUR

103
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.440
<i>Now it's silent</i>

104
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.120
AT HOME

105
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.280
<i>Your hand in mine</i>
<i>Or is this too little to carry on</i>?

106
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.480
<i>I just don't know how</i>

107
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.400
<i>With everything I do</i>

108
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.160
<i>I can't bear it when the evening comes</i>

109
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.760
<i>Oh. because in the evening</i>
<i>I miss you often</i>

110
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.240
I think it was very strange for everyone
because we'd just gone through corona.

111
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.520
We sat at home for two years.
then suddenly we could restart.

112
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.080
We went from zero to a hundred.
Suddenly our schedule was totally full.

113
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.400
So much happened that this…

114
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.800
I feel we have now come so much further.

115
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.920
It all went fairly organically.

116
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.960
There was no great plan
for what to do next.

117
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.520
And the popularity grew.

118
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.200
The shows became bigger.

119
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.560
And then came corona.

120
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.560
Suzan and Freek
kept doing their own thing.

121
00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.640
But what no one realized

122
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.520
was that once corona was over.

123
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.520
they had gotten so big.

124
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.600
Actually we knew it.
but we didn't feel it.

125
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.160
We didn't. they didn't either.

126
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.920
<i>I've already thought a hundred times</i>

127
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.880
<i>I'll call you tonight</i>

128
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.800
<i>Tonight</i>

129
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.400
<i>I'll tell you I still think of you</i>

130
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.600
<i>Waited a hundred times</i>

131
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.080
<i>But I'll call you tonight</i>

132
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.280
<i>Tonight</i>

133
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.120
Have you already played this?

134
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.040
-No.
-Okay.

135
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.520
Just the intro as usual.

136
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.080
And then I say "okay" again.

137
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.520
Then you tap him in.

138
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.240
We'll have to see if that goes smoothly.

139
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.320
And then we play it all the way to…

140
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.360
From the bridge. from the sing-along bit.

141
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.680
And at some point.
we start counting out. Then we know it.

142
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.600
That's too complicated. Freek.

143
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.200
It's nice. though.
It doesn't matter. does it?

144
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.040
You'd better get it right tomorrow.
Keep it like it was.

145
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.680
Yes. Freek. It sounds better.

146
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.560
Try to do it one bar earlier.
Give it a try.

147
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.640
But tomorrow we'll do it differently.
Why are we doing this?

148
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.360
-Let's try it once.
-Okay. one more time.

149
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.600
I think Suzan has a keen eye for detail

150
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.000
and wants to be sure
what their product is.

151
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.520
They are both like that.

152
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.960
Freek too. But he's also
a bit of a rocker. so to speak.

153
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.520
-Yeah.
-He has done something.

154
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.080
He wants it to be really great
and assert his own view.

155
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.400
And it's funny that Suus will then say.

156
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.560
"We need to move on now.
We've only got five more minutes."

157
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.360
And that really is the case.

158
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.280
But you can see Freek thinking.

159
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.280
"I don't want that.
I just want to figure this out now."

160
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.960
So that's the conflict.

161
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.760
But I actually think
they have a good balance.

162
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.680
Yeah. me too.

163
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.240
They're the perfect couple
you could follow all day on Instagram

164
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.000
without getting tired of them.

165
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.280
Because they're not acting.
they're genuine.

166
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.440
They don't act any differently
from how we know them.

167
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.960
I like trying out the ideas.
but at some point--

168
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.720
That's what the sound check is for.

169
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.440
As for the rest… We don't have
rehearsals with the band. we have nothing.

170
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.440
That's the time for it. let's use it.

171
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.640
That's true too.
But let's change it first.

172
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.680
Let's try again tomorrow.
We have another show.

173
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.560
-I spent hours on it this morning.
-We're doing it then?

174
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.800
After five minutes. "let's leave it."

175
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.840
Yeah. then I'm going to look into it.

176
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.320
-It doesn't have to be all at once.
-Okay.

177
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.680
I'm not going to do it.

178
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.680
Let's not forget that we're a team.

179
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.880
Yeah. of course.

180
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.120
Hey.

181
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.080
-Hello.
-Hey. Hello.

182
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.960
When you get bigger.
a lot of things come into play.

183
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.960
It becomes more
about other things and less about music.

184
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.080
I have one more question
about <i>Farmer Wants a Wife</i>.

185
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.560
And that's why I want to do things myself.

186
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.720
Because that only has to do
with making music. so to speak.

187
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.640
And…

188
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.040
I miss that sometimes
because everything gets bigger

189
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.280
and music becomes
a smaller percentage of what you're doing.

190
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.200
-Yes.
-Yeah. it's the last show.

191
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.000
-Who's got a yell?
-Who has a yell?

192
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.920
-Well. Super. guys.
-Yeah. Hey!

193
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.720
Maybe it's also a case of letting go.

194
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.360
But we used to do
everything as a pair. so…

195
00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.920
And that is a bit…

196
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.080
At some point. someone else has to do it.

197
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.240
But I try to hold on as long as possible

198
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.600
because for me.
it's very much about making music.

199
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.120
and why I started making music
and why I really like playing in a band

200
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.080
and being very much on top
of everything that happens.

201
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.200
The two of us always played covers.
and we decided where it went.

202
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.960
It would be crazy to play with a band now
and let all that go.

203
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.920
<i>Even more beautiful than I imagine</i>

204
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.440
<i>Even more beautiful than your reflection</i>

205
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.760
As an artist. I'm not insecure.

206
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.280
because I'm happy with what we do
and I'm proud of what we do.

207
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.560
As a singer still. sometimes…

208
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.360
because I think
Suus sings much better than me.

209
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.360
And I've always seen myself
more as a guitarist

210
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.480
who also sang a bit.

211
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.400
And now it's the opposite.
I often don't have a guitar

212
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.960
but just stand and sing on stage.

213
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.640
I still often hear a little voice.

214
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.440
"I'm actually a guitarist
who doesn't have his guitar with him."

215
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.560
Thank you.

216
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.640
When I move on stage wearing heels.
I do this. With my heels on.

217
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.800
So I don't move.

218
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.600
I'm much more masculine. or tougher.

219
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.560
And then it doesn't fit together.

220
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.920
And Freek is just really handsome.

221
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.280
He just looks like a model.

222
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.640
And I have a somewhat

223
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.280
more characteristic face.

224
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.800
I'm not totally dissatisfied at all.
but not super satisfied either.

225
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.560
If I look nice. I think. yes that's good.

226
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.320
But if it's a bad angle or something.
I really think…

227
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.440
Then you can really detest yourself.

228
00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.520
So…

229
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.520
Yeah. I do find it difficult sometimes.

230
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.920
I don't want
to make a big issue out of it.

231
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.840
I'm rummaging in my purse
with all my drugstore makeup.

232
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.240
When streaming. it's with other women.

233
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.200
But now I'm alone with Freek
and I don't have a real comparison.

234
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.880
But when I'm with other women.
I often have…

235
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.760
Then they have their own makeup artists.

236
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.360
and they sit for hours.

237
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.040
They look great. More and more beautiful.

238
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.640
Then I think a bit.

239
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.560
we have half an hour.
I think I'll see the makeup artist.

240
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.720
Like with the men. I just sit down.

241
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.840
Then I think. should I do more?

242
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.640
Then you doubt yourself.
Is this a good choice?

243
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.360
Because you stand alongside them.

244
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.880
But… yeah.

245
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.160
I'm still a bit lost.

246
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.560
Until now. I've always done it this way.

247
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.440
-Hi there.
<i>-Hello.</i>

248
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.720
I'm covered in sequins.

249
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.360
SINGING COACH

250
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.880
I slept really poorly last night.
maybe just a little stress. I guess.

251
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.640
I felt like it was my stomach.
like you said.

252
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.040
And I ate fruit
and had a good lunch today.

253
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.720
and now I haven't had dinner.
just a banana.

254
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.640
I'll eat right after the show.
to keep my stomach calm.

255
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.880
Because I've noticed
I'm coughing much less now.

256
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.920
<i>-Oh. yes. You see? That's good.</i>
-Yeah.

257
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.320
When we were allowed to perform again.
I got sick after a few shows.

258
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:27.600
I got a kind of laryngitis.
and I got everything at once.

259
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.880
It really scared me.
"What have I got. how long will it last?"

260
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.720
I was suffering so much
that I even had to cancel some shows.

261
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.080
It was terrible.

262
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.640
<i>Try not to breathe in too much.</i>
<i>Especially where your hand is.</i>

263
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.480
<i>That's it.</i>

264
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.160
It does vibrate a bit.
so you might feel a tickle

265
00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.360
but not so bad
that I actually have to cough.

266
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:56.040
She's a real perfectionist.
If she finds she can't do something well.

267
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.800
she works on it
and makes sure that it's good.

268
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.120
But with your body.
you can't take care of it yourself.

269
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.080
You need to take time to get better.

270
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.600
But she's very hard on herself.

271
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.280
She already found it hard
to sing at 80% for an evening

272
00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.400
because she always gives 110%.

273
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.800
So that really caused me a lot of stress.

274
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.880
You suddenly think.
wow. we're all here together

275
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.120
but we're dependent
on my voice and Freek's voice.

276
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.840
Because. however unpleasant.
you can replace a band member.

277
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.600
but if Freek goes on stage
with someone else.

278
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.640
I don't know if people would accept that.

279
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.040
I felt some pressure.

280
00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.400
<i>All my life…</i>

281
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.200
-It feels okay.
-Good.

282
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.440
-Just precarious.
-It's all there. right?

283
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.400
I just feel a bit… It will be fine.

284
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.840
And just cast off
the consonants quickly. as Tamara says.

285
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.000
-Or just hold out the mic. Your turn!
-Now your turn.

286
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.720
And if you make it
to a song where you think…

287
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.840
It's tense when you've been sick. but…

288
00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.880
you've got it.

289
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.960
Very precise.

290
00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.160
If she was working on something.
it had to be--

291
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.360
-Good.
-Good. yes.

292
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.600
She was very busy with music back then.

293
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.720
SUZAN'S PARENTS

294
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.800
Small piano. large piano.

295
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.320
Always busy with music.

296
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.840
You got this. Suusje.

297
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.880
-Huh? Good luck.
-Good luck.

298
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.960
It will be fine.

299
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.200
-It'll be fine. yeah?
-Yeah.

300
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.640
Keep in mind. the audience is up close.

301
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.240
-Yeah.
-So you don't get a shock.

302
00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.200
Whatever he did.
everything had to be possible.

303
00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.520
You could say in advance.
"You can't do that."

304
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.640
FREEK'S MOTHER

305
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.200
Well. he thought it could be done
and did it his own way.

306
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.760
He also didn't care
what he used to make music.

307
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.320
A tiny guitar. ukulele.

308
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.240
even on a tennis racket.
it didn't matter what.

309
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.080
He made the show himself.

310
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.120
When I see him performing now.

311
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.680
I think. Freek. delightful.
You're still that toddler at heart.

312
00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.960
Just now you're on a different stage.

313
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.560
But really you're still just
that kid from 15 years ago. so yeah.

314
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.640
<i>Asked for an opinion</i>

315
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.640
<i>I'm no longer myself</i>
<i>And that already feels strange</i>

316
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.960
<i>Normally everything passes me by</i>

317
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.440
<i>But not today</i>
<i>This one's for me</i>

318
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.480
<i>This one's for me</i>

319
00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.080
<i>This one's for me</i>

320
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.280
<i>This one's for me</i>

321
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.640
<i>This one's for me</i>

322
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:44.680
<i>This one's for me</i>

323
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.280
Everyone in Arnhem. Thank you!

324
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.440
Voilà.

325
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.200
-Oh man.
-Hey.

326
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.560
I'm glad I survived it.

327
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.880
-You did it.
-So good. man.

328
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.520
-I'm happy with it.
-Well done.

329
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.680
My voice is better too. thankfully.

330
00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.680
It was good. man.

331
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.800
It went well. Good that you jumped in.

332
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.040
If I just stay quiet. I don't cough.

333
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.840
I'm so happy. Really well done.

334
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.080
It was good.
If you haven't played for a week

335
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
and then it's suddenly full force.

336
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.520
-Yeah.
-Well done. Are you happy?

337
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.200
-Very happy.
-Relieved?

338
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.680
Yes. it's a relief.

339
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.440
Freek was the first real

340
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.560
serious relationship
where she was really in love.

341
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.880
I think Freek was 14 and Suzan 15…

342
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.920
SUZAN'S SISTER

343
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.720
…so they've been together for a long time.

344
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.920
She was always busy with him.

345
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.560
At our middle school.
we always had school concerts

346
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.600
and the years were a bit mixed.

347
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.600
And then things
kind of developed between them.

348
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.160
That was a love of…

349
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.040
Then. one afternoon.
he was at Suzan's. trampolining

350
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.320
and he came home and said. "We broke up."

351
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.920
"We saw each other too much."
Well. then the courtship was over.

352
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.280
Afterwards. Suus would always say.
"I really miss Freek."

353
00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.960
She was on MSN the whole time.

354
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.560
SUZAN'S FRIENDS

355
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.400
-She was online the whole time.
-Yeah.

356
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.360
-So that Freek… Well. it worked.
-Yeah.

357
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.760
It didn't take long.
then Freek was like "Hmm."

358
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.640
Freek was a showman.

359
00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.560
If I walked into a bar behind him.

360
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.320
all the women's heads would turn…

361
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.240
FREEK'S FRIEND

362
00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.840
…and you're there thinking.
"They're all looking at Freek."

363
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.360
I think Freek is the party animal

364
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.640
and Suzan is more serious.

365
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.560
And it works well.
That Freek is occasionally pulled along.

366
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.600
"You're not staying out until three. four.
Come home with me."

367
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.280
And at one point.
I came downstairs on a Sunday evening.

368
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.440
Jesse was on the couch. and I said.
"Freek's forgotten his sweater."

369
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.480
And Jesse said. "If he forgot his sweater.

370
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.320
he's forgotten his shoes too."

371
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.240
Yeah.

372
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.400
And so my dad went straight upstairs.

373
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.440
and they were lying there together.
In the bottom of the bunk bed. I think.

374
00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.920
For us. it was a sign
that this was serious.

375
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.800
AT HOME

376
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.760
We spend a lot of time together.

377
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.160
People often ask
if we drive each other crazy.

378
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.560
but I don't think so.

379
00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.960
I can spend every day with Freek.
It's all good.

380
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.400
I know him inside and out.

381
00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.800
He knows when to keep his mouth shut.
or when he can chat with me.

382
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.400
-Almost 3.000 tickets already sold.
-Great.

383
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.200
In three hours?

384
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.640
-Pretty relaxed.
-"Pretty relaxed"? Totally insane.

385
00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.600
If this sells out quickly.
then there's that on top.

386
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.560
And if not?

387
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.680
-Then not.
-Okay.

388
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.560
Then you have a theater tour of 47 shows.

389
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.680
I'm very organized.
but my schedule is full.

390
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.760
This is it. I know exactly….
we don't need to add more.

391
00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.560
And Freek can take on three other jobs.
he can handle that.

392
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.960
He never gets stressed. no.

393
00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.400
I'm a very responsible person.

394
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.160
I need to sleep well. eat a bit well.

395
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.400
have a bit of structure in my life.

396
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.280
then I have self-confidence.
then I feel good.

397
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.880
And with Freek there.

398
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.200
I don't have to do anything alone.
Freek and I together. that's nice.

399
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.480
I find that I need structure above all.

400
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.480
If I sit on the couch.
it doesn't work out.

401
00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.160
because I get into
a kind of miserable state.

402
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.120
I'm waiting
until I can do something again.

403
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.200
I always think I'm quite relaxed.

404
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.400
but sometimes I realize.
maybe if you just keep doing things.

405
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.320
it doesn't necessarily make you relaxed.

406
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.160
But for me. it is also a way

407
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.320
to keep a bit of space free in my head.

408
00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:49.720
PREPARATION FOR ZIGGO DOME SHOWS

409
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.680
-So sick.
-Yeah.

410
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.240
Really funny.

411
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.000
-Fucking huge. hey?
-Yeah.

412
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.840
-Where do we go?
-Here. I think.

413
00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.920
I think here too. There's a door.

414
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.720
-Hey.
-Hello.

415
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.360
Should we ask?
It looks like a loading dock.

416
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.680
-No. here's the hall.
-Oh. we're there!

417
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.880
Totally sick. right?

418
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.560
Jesus Christ.

419
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.680
The second section too. that's really…

420
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.960
-It's far away.
-You don't want to be queasy.

421
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.200
You can't imagine
that it will all be full soon.

422
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.400
-Well…
-You can?

423
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.760
Hi. Mom.

424
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.600
<i>-Hi.</i>
-Look where I am.

425
00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.760
<i>No amount of money</i>
<i>could get me on that stage.</i>

426
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.120
-I don't doubt it.
<i>-Won't you just die?</i>

427
00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.200
-And here's the stage.
<i>-Terrible.</i>

428
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.600
And there's the center stage.
That's funny too.

429
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.120
<i>And where do we stand? Below?</i>

430
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.440
Between the first and second sections.

431
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.240
There's the section
where you can invite people along.

432
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.480
-And you'll be over there.
<i>-Where the lights are?</i>

433
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.240
Yes. by the lights. By the round ones.

434
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.680
<i>Really.</i>

435
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.040
And that's the VIP section
where we always were.

436
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.000
<i>That's where you always performed. right?</i>

437
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.080
Yes. that in-between bit back there.

438
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.800
<i>That's your little tent.</i>

439
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.720
That's our tent. Yes. right.
It got out of control.

440
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.640
Some people go cycling or sit in a bar.

441
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.400
-Freek and Suzan made music together.
-Yes.

442
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.080
And did a lot of performances.
In bars too.

443
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.000
-Until late at night.
-A side job. at the same time.

444
00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.320
-It was kind of--
-They worked hard.

445
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.040
Freek had a guitar.
and Suzan had that keyboard.

446
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.960
and Wout helped with the sound.

447
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.240
Suzan herself once said.

448
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.120
"If I know Wout is there.
I can perform well."

449
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.560
So Wout was very important in their lives.

450
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.920
I much preferred
being active behind the scenes.

451
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.880
FREEK'S BROTHER

452
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.440
Freek just enjoyed making music.

453
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.520
We'd often tinker together
to make a pedal board for a guitar.

454
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.480
or he would buy something online…

455
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.040
He didn't have a driver's license.
so I had to go along

456
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.920
or drive him over to Suzan.

457
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.920
Yeah. that was a really good time.

458
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.200
Because everything
we experienced together.

459
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.880
he then used to further himself.

460
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.280
-I'm curious to see if it's the same.
-Yeah.

461
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.880
-The corner here.
-Yeah.

462
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.400
They've got new screens.

463
00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.800
-Member lounge.
-Oh yeah.

464
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.960
This is where we were.

465
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.640
These tables weren't there
and we stood here.

466
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.080
-Yeah.
-And people sat here eating.

467
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.840
And that's where the food was served.

468
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.600
We would see it coming over.

469
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.960
That was always funny
because usually you're timing it a bit.

470
00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.000
You work toward the last song in the set.

471
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.640
To a kind of encore.

472
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.920
That never came.

473
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.840
And here you'd be playing.
and someone would come in.

474
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.880
"The concert is starting."
And everyone would get up.

475
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.280
And we were like. "Have fun!"

476
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.600
-Exactly. "The end."
-Yeah. "Ta-da!"

477
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.520
Here are some more performances
in the Ziggo Dome.

478
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.600
So we were here. That was over there.

479
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.480
-You always had a tie on.
-Always a white shirt with a tie.

480
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.680
If someone needed a waiter.
I was always ready to help.

481
00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.000
Here. that was there.

482
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.520
-Yeah.
-How funny.

483
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.560
2014. So that's eight years ago.

484
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.200
Seven-and-a-half years ago.

485
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.120
When they started recording
<i>The Minutes</i> for Facebook.

486
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.280
and they brought out
a new number every week.

487
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.400
they needed a name.

488
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.400
Then they set up a Facebook page
as "Suzan & Freek." That's who they were.

489
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.800
So they didn't think of a real name.

490
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.560
Only when they started performing
as Suzan & Freek

491
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:54.040
did the name really become their name
because then we could no longer change it.

492
00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.640
I thought this time was really nice.

493
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.720
Freek lived in Tilburg.

494
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.400
and Suzan lived in Delft.

495
00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.640
They had their own lives. the two of them.

496
00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.920
Then they had <i>The Minute.</i>
and on weekends they traveled

497
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
to Achterhoek together. if possible.
or separately.

498
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.320
because <i>The Minute</i> had to be recorded.

499
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.320
Then it was released
on Friday evening at 6:30.

500
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.760
That was the best time. Freek said.
to put something on Facebook.

501
00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.720
…positioned like that? It's a bit uneven.

502
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.840
That bungling around
eventually helped them move forward.

503
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.040
-Ladies.
-And gentlemen.

504
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.120
-Give yourself a clap.
-Because we have…

505
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.440
Twenty thousand likes!

506
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.080
KORTENHOEF. JANUARY 2022

507
00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.000
GOLD

508
00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.240
Does it hang like that?

509
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.560
The advantage is
that you're also the artist.

510
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.880
Yes. great.

511
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.880
-A bit more there.
-I agree. Okay.

512
00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.840
I think the start and end are great.
but that middle section…

513
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.000
-Yes. much less.
-Do you feel as if…

514
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.840
-It's not connected.
-Just do…

515
00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.120
It needs to be simpler.
I'm hearing that now.

516
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.800
The first time I heard of Suzan & Freek.

517
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.640
we had sort of agreed to be in the studio

518
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.120
and get a cup of coffee.

519
00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.080
Usually if I'm asked.

520
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.600
I would check. "What do they do?"

521
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.360
Or say. "Send me something."

522
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.680
Or what makes sense at the time.

523
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.040
"Do you have any videos online.
so I can hear what you do?"

524
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.360
So I vaguely remember
that there was a video.

525
00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.080
And it needs to grab me right away.

526
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.000
MUSIC PRODUCER

527
00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.000
So I think. I like what you're doing.

528
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.160
And I can add something for you.

529
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.960
<i>All my life</i>

530
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.440
<i>I've been meeting the same people</i>

531
00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.280
<i>How can it suddenly be so simple</i>?

532
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.240
<i>How can it suddenly be so simple</i>?

533
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.280
What if we make this a chorus?

534
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.960
I do feel the urge to--

535
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.200
-You want to do something with this?
-Well…

536
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.200
If you feel it too.

537
00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.000
-It's nice.
-It's a strong piece.

538
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.400
We started putting other people's songs
into the "Suzan & Freek" wrapper.

539
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.880
Suus behind the piano. Freek on guitar.

540
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.680
It was instantly good together.

541
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.920
What we're doing sounds cool.

542
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.800
Not concerned about
what the outside world thinks

543
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.440
or how big it could be.

544
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.480
That's not too important in the beginning.

545
00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.840
But in time. Just so. right?

546
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.640
This feels totally left.
and that feels totally right.

547
00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.920
-That's what we were looking for.
-Exactly.

548
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.720
Let's give ourselves 15 minutes
to get everything set down.

549
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.360
The first thing we ever did
was a song that was a hit at the time.

550
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.800
That was six years ago.

551
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.680
That was The Chainsmokers
with "Don't Let Me Down."

552
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.800
MUSIC VIDEO. 2016

553
00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.240
And we gave it a totally different feel

554
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.240
that is typically Suzan & Freek.

555
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.480
Then we said. "This sounds super cool."

556
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.800
We brought it out.

557
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.960
Which means it was on Spotify. you know.

558
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.040
<i>Don't let me down</i>

559
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.360
I remember them standing here.

560
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.480
"Shall we post it or not?"

561
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.760
I said.
"Guys. I'm going to the supermarket."

562
00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.760
I came back from shopping.

563
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.520
"You won't believe it.
The artist has responded!"

564
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.360
"I told you that you should do it."

565
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.400
If I recall.
they then did a club tour right away

566
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.560
with covers.

567
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.280
And it sold out.

568
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.520
-Holy moly.
-Really an intimate little hall.

569
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.080
The smallest of our…

570
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:20.680
Arie?

571
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.960
Hi.

572
00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.920
-Jerry Mulder. Very nice.
-Last time. it was the three of us here.

573
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.040
-The two of us.
-Five-and-a-half years ago.

574
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.120
-Up there on the balcony.
-150 people.

575
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.360
-The three of us.
-We were talking about that.

576
00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.320
Five-and-a-half years ago. our first one.

577
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.240
-Crazy. right? As if it were yesterday.
-Yeah.

578
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.160
Cool. right.

579
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.000
Nice too. that it's so small.

580
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.240
On October 21st. 2017.
we had our very first show here.

581
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.120
The very first club show
of the group Suzan & Freek.

582
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.320
In the upper hall.

583
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.400
And we had <i>one</i> crew member.

584
00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.360
and he's over there in the corner.
Jerry Mulder. ladies and gentlemen.

585
00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.880
He was backliner. lighting technician.
front of house. and monitor man.

586
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.960
And security.

587
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.960
Financial director.

588
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.760
He doesn't have to do anything now.
He's earned it all.

589
00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:12.160
The first time I heard of them.

590
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.000
I was working
at the 4Days Marches in Nijmegen.

591
00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.960
I was a freelancer
and I worked for the company

592
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.480
that arranged the light and sound
for that stage.

593
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.760
I had no idea who Suzan & Freek were.

594
00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.960
SOUND ENGINEER

595
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.600
I had to google them.

596
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.880
I had to look online to see who they were.

597
00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.280
So I knew who I had to look for.
an image. so to say.

598
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.320
But they could
just have been two people in town.

599
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.320
walking through the town.

600
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.520
Yeah. great.

601
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.720
-I might go very…
-He stood here.

602
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.800
Last chorus.

603
00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.000
It was a relatively small stage.

604
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.040
There was no room for a band.
It was full with two people.

605
00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:48.960
Nice. guys.

606
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.200
I thought. where's everyone coming from?

607
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.920
It was suddenly so full.

608
00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.560
We'll see who can sing loudest.
Are we ready?

609
00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.840
NIJMEGEN 4DAYS MARCHES
JULY 2017

610
00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.960
We'll start with my side. Here it comes.

611
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.640
One. two. three.

612
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.640
We can do it better.
Let's go! One. two. three.

613
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.520
We can be louder!

614
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.600
One. two three.

615
00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.840
Then I realized that they were
more famous than I thought they were.

616
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.800
We were in Nijmegen tonight.
and it went like this…

617
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.480
Then we stayed in touch.

618
00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.480
That's why I'm sitting here now.

619
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.720
When I go back and forth. it gets so…

620
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:05.280
-So boring.
-Here in the lows.

621
00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.160
I want it to be even cooler.
I find it too easy.

622
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.720
Can I say that?

623
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.960
It began to snowball
and kept getting bigger.

624
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.800
At that time. I also had Bierpop.

625
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.840
I asked if they wanted
to play as the opening act.

626
00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.520
"Oh. yes. Very much. What an honor."
And all saying "Wow!"

627
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.440
ARTIST

628
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.800
It was really nice

629
00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.840
because they sat there together

630
00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.280
with her on the piano
and Freek all dopey.

631
00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.560
Sorry. Freek.

632
00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.720
On the guitar. a bit like this.

633
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.680
And so nervous. boy.

634
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.640
But the hall sang along with everything.

635
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.240
and then I realized.

636
00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.600
this will last another month.
then it's going to explode.

637
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.080
They did more shows.

638
00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.560
They were the opening act
for international shows.

639
00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.840
Always doing covers.

640
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.640
Then we said. "Shall we write a song?"

641
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.080
"Yeah. that's good."

642
00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.680
And I asked.
"Have you ever written a song?"

643
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.440
"We've never written a song.
We've tried. but it was nothing."

644
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.160
-"Shall we write a song then?"
-"Okay."

645
00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.760
Freek worked with us behind the scenes.

646
00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.680
and we did talk about those videos.

647
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.760
How they did it. why they did it.

648
00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:14.760
And I increasingly came to understand

649
00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.520
that we could learn from him as a label.

650
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.680
How he has a very strong sense
of what works for people.

651
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.360
What works for the public.

652
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.800
We always said.
"If you have your own song.

653
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.280
we'll talk about it."

654
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.800
Until Freek came to my office one day.

655
00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.640
"We've written our own song."

656
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.760
And I remember. It doesn't happen often.
and I'll say it here…

657
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.800
I heard that song once and I said.
"Freek. that's a genuine hit."

658
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.520
I remember he replied. "You think so?"

659
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.560
<i>I can't bear it when the evening comes</i>

660
00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.040
<i>Oh. because in the evening</i>
<i>I miss you often</i>

661
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.560
<i>You know I don't listen</i>
<i>When you talk like that</i>

662
00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:59.120
<i>And touch me like that</i>
<i>And then leave</i>

663
00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.840
<i>Tell me it will be fine</i>

664
00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.080
<i>Give me pieces of future</i>

665
00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.960
<i>Or should I just let you go</i>

666
00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.960
<i>I can't bear it when the evening comes</i>

667
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.760
<i>I have truly missed you often</i>

668
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.680
You'd be in the supermarket
and suddenly hear <i>"Als het avond is."</i>

669
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.680
Then you would think. guys!

670
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.040
All week. "This is her."

671
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.480
I still get that today.

672
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.200
Recently at the hairdresser.
it came on. Every time.

673
00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.000
She's only human.
but so special. and you're so proud.

674
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.440
Thank you all for coming this evening.

675
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.040
Hopefully you get home quickly.

676
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.920
-Safe journey. Thank you.
-Thank you.

677
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.040
I like it best with the bun on her head.

678
00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.440
This is also nice. but…

679
00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.360
This is just for one night. you know.
In the glam.

680
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.520
In the glam.

681
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.320
It's pretty. that dress.

682
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.920
-You think it's pretty?
-Yeah.

683
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.120
Okay.

684
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.120
Armpits well-shaved?

685
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.160
Am I overdressed?
I see understated dresses.

686
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.800
-No. look at her. I was just about to say.
-Oh no.

687
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.880
-Will it be okay?
-Yeah.

688
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.480
-No. but I still feel like…
-That's always true with things like this.

689
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.240
-Suzan. act like an artist.
-Yeah.

690
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:41.920
EDISON POP AWARDS 2022

691
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.920
I realize that
I didn't start this to become famous.

692
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.680
That's the only thing
I find difficult at times.

693
00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.720
And that's maybe the reason

694
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.480
why we never do anything
non-music related on TV.

695
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.920
-Very good.
-Great.

696
00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.240
I like music. I don't find being famous…

697
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.600
I would rather not be.

698
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.040
Great.

699
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.240
I don't know
if people have a complete image of me.

700
00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.400
because I'm not
a person who reveals my inner thoughts.

701
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.200
I also always tend
to make a joke out of everything.

702
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.320
whether good or bad.

703
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.400
I had a kind of <i>Star Wars</i> robot outfit.

704
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.200
and when I turned up.
Suus said. "We're not doing that." No. no…

705
00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.680
On the other hand. that is who I am.

706
00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:30.840
I'm still frequently discovering who I am<i>.</i>

707
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.560
and it's an ongoing quest.

708
00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.440
-How are you?
-Yeah. I'm good.

709
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.640
I've sometimes heard people
talking about Suzan & Freek

710
00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.480
and I didn't think
they were talking about me.

711
00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.120
Suzan & Freek has become
a separate thing in itself.

712
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.880
I think the challenge is

713
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.800
for us to clearly determine
what we will and won't give away.

714
00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.360
If you can dream it. you can do it.

715
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.840
Likeable and Dutch to the core.

716
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.960
The Edison in the "Album" category
goes to Suzan & Freek.

717
00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.640
Wow.

718
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.840
Thank you. An Edison.

719
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.720
Hey. thank you. Also nice.

720
00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.400
-Great.
-Great.

721
00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.000
-Together is good.
-Yeah.

722
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.320
Freek was already
working in the music industry

723
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:26.720
behind the scenes.
Before we did this. before we were famous.

724
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.560
And I used to go along
to the music festivals.

725
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.120
And nobody spoke to me.
which I thought was great.

726
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.120
I'm a bit of an introvert. just let me
stand in a corner with a drink.

727
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.040
And now. suddenly.
everyone comes over to me.

728
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.120
And sometimes I think.
do these people really like me?

729
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.440
Or do they want to get something from me?

730
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.840
It feels that way at times.

731
00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.680
You get the feeling
that everyone wants something from you.

732
00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.720
We have very good people around us.
I'm looked after.

733
00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.200
THE ACHTERHOEK
FREEK'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. APRIL 2022

734
00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.040
Hi. hi.

735
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.880
Do you always leave keys in the door?

736
00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.000
-All good?
-Freekie.

737
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.800
-Yes.
-Yeah. All right.

738
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.800
You've got a book by Robbie Williams?

739
00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.800
Yes. you can have it. I got it this week.

740
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.600
-Is it good?
-I had…

741
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.720
I got to pick out all these books.
and then I thought

742
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:28.520
if Freek comes. I could surprise you with…

743
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:29.960
-Nice.
-Take it with you.

744
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.280
-Freek. do you want tea or coffee?
-I'll have water.

745
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.000
The best song?

746
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.280
I still find<i> "Hoofd in de wolken"</i>
a really nice song.

747
00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.800
And…

748
00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.040
<i>"Als het avond is."</i>
I think that's a nice song. but…

749
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.400
it's a painful song for me.

750
00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.960
-I don't know myself.
-You've got plenty of records.

751
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.280
Maybe also<i> "Als het avond is."</i>
Just because it was the first

752
00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.000
and. looking back. it also related to you.

753
00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.560
But Freek. that song was…

754
00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.080
-You'd already finished it in July.
-Yeah.

755
00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:09.480
And when the bolt from the blue
came in August…

756
00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.760
-You separated. yeah.
-We separated.

757
00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.240
I mean. from one moment to the next…

758
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.160
So actually…

759
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.640
The story was tacked on afterward.

760
00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.240
Yes. while you--

761
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.480
-But when you hear the lyrics.
-Yeah.

762
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.560
-That was exactly it.
-Yeah.

763
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.240
-Strange.
-Very much.

764
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.760
When we'd just broken through.

765
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:35.200
you separated from each other.
and that was a moment

766
00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.600
where I…

767
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.520
Everyone had enough on their plate.

768
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.880
In that situation.
if things were not going so well for me.

769
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.080
I didn't want to pass that on to you.

770
00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.720
The night that you first…

771
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.240
I'm telling it.

772
00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.800
The night that you played it
for the first time…

773
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.960
I think it was a Wednesday evening.

774
00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.080
At eight o'clock. we. Vincent and I.

775
00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.640
put our signatures on the divorce papers.

776
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.360
The same evening.
I'll never forget that moment.

777
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.200
So that song has so much meaning for me.

778
00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.600
But people around us all say.

779
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:14.840
"How can a song be made like that?
It's your story."

780
00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.080
-Yeah. exactly.
-But it still touches me.

781
00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.360
In just one moment.

782
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.840
your entire family is turned upside down.

783
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.040
You always think
that other parents get divorced.

784
00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:37.440
You hear about
so-and-so with divorced parents.

785
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.800
And my parents were both almost 60.

786
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.200
You think it won't ever happen.

787
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.520
But it did happen.

788
00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.840
I hadn't been living at home
for seven or eight years.

789
00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.720
I would go home on the weekend.

790
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.400
but I didn't necessarily realize
that it wasn't going so well for them.

791
00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.760
So it really came as a blow.

792
00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.680
And. in the beginning.

793
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.720
I didn't have much contact with my father.

794
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.960
He was with his new love.

795
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:18.960
I find it difficult because
I don't really like to talk about it.

796
00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.320
Suus in particular really helped me a lot.

797
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.800
It costs me a lot of energy
to be angry with people.

798
00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.160
I think I handle it best by saying.

799
00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.800
"Let's try and look at the good things."

800
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.480
And let's see what we can take from that.

801
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.640
Suus really helped me with that.

802
00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.680
Today is a bit of a special day for us.

803
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.440
-We already mentioned. it's my birthday.
-It's your birthday too. Freek.

804
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.240
But also because
it's three years to the day

805
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.160
since<i> "Als het avond is"</i>
reached number one.

806
00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.640
And I think it's a funny story
because we both had regular jobs

807
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.800
and we didn't really have
that much to do with music.

808
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.440
We just did it as a hobby.

809
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.880
And we thought. let's write our own song.

810
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.080
And we'll see.

811
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.040
And we brought it out.
and it kept growing until suddenly

812
00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.160
it was at number one.
On that Sunday evening. we decided.

813
00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.360
"We're going to resign and go for it."

814
00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.440
Well. look at us now.

815
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.760
I'm so proud when I see all this.

816
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.360
Thank you for coming.

817
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.120
<i>Sometimes I feel bad</i>

818
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:36.520
<i>That you don't want</i>
<i>To talk so much any more</i>

819
00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.880
<i>Then I miss the time</i>
<i>When I could be angry with you</i>

820
00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:45.960
<i>Now it's silent</i>

821
00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.040
<i>As night falls</i>

822
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.800
<i>I whisper softly</i>

823
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.880
<i>Do you hear me maybe?</i>

824
00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:01.440
<i>I just don't know how</i>

825
00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.000
<i>With everything I do</i>

826
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.440
<i>I can't bear it when the evening comes</i>

827
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.920
<i>Oh. because in the evening</i>
<i>I miss you often</i>

828
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.680
<i>Tell me it will be fine</i>

829
00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.920
<i>Give me pieces of future</i>

830
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.280
<i>Or should I just let you go?</i>

831
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.920
<i>I can't bear it when the evening comes</i>

832
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.560
<i>I have truly missed you often</i>

833
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.360
Hey. Suzan & Freek.

834
00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.920
…that no one's following us. no security.

835
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.800
-He's in shot.
-Yes. exactly.

836
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.520
-Wait. no. That's right.
-Yeah.

837
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.360
It's usually like that.
I go that way. I stand here.

838
00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.880
-The other way round to usual.
-Yeah.

839
00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.960
Am I walking all alone?

840
00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.040
-Or is there a security guard?
-There's someone in the background.

841
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.440
-No.
-Maybe on this step or that one?

842
00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.240
-One of the steps.
-Use that step?

843
00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.320
When I first heard
the plans for the Ziggo Dome.

844
00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.400
I have to admit that…

845
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.120
If you think about it rationally

846
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.520
from an industry perspective.
you think. "Steady now. guys."

847
00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.440
But Suzan & Freek.
the rules don't apply to them.

848
00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.160
Wow.

849
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:30.040
Bizarre to think this will be
totally full of people tonight.

850
00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.640
Freek is truly
the brains behind Suzan & Freek.

851
00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.880
who is busy planning well in advance.

852
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.480
I think Freek already dreamed
of the Ziggo Dome at an early stage

853
00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.440
while Suzan was still focused
on the neighborhood bar.

854
00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.960
-Hi. honey. How are things?
-Hi.

855
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.920
-Pretty heavy. huh?
-This one was very heavy. I thought.

856
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.160
It bothered me
that so much still needs doing.

857
00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.320
-Yeah. but it's a lot for everyone.
-I think that too.

858
00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.120
-I don't blame anyone.
-No.

859
00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.880
-It was just chaos.
-Exactly.

860
00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.640
But that's… how can it be? So crazy.

861
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.000
Sick.

862
00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:14.000
Suzan & Freek. Ziggo Dome 2022.

863
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.280
Just look.

864
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.760
I have no idea where it is.

865
00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.840
I find it quite exciting. you know.

866
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.240
Just think.
the pre-program starts at 7:30.

867
00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.160
but they're not going to make it.

868
00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.640
-I find that difficult. I'll forget it.
-Anyone have some white tape?

869
00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.360
-Can I have a bit of tape?
-Hey. Hello!

870
00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:38.160
Stress. So much stress.
Freek too. you could tell from afar.

871
00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:42.480
Because there's so much to run through
and things keep going wrong.

872
00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.240
That makes Freek and me nervous.

873
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:48.080
We're both people who want
everything perfectly under control.

874
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.440
You hear five men
on top of each other in your earphones.

875
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.920
-Just all mixed up.
-Yeah.

876
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.640
And you go somewhere and the stands
that should be there are missing.

877
00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.400
-I hope that this evening…
-Yes. you need them here.

878
00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.000
Everyone is under pressure.
but then we get nervous.

879
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.880
Actually. it's a bit too much pressure.

880
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.160
Some people might get used to it.

881
00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.840
I think the pressure is inhuman today.

882
00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.480
I just have to laugh at how stressed I am.

883
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.560
Wait for me.

884
00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.720
-Cool. man.
-Yeah.

885
00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.120
I really find this to be
something I never thought of.

886
00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.320
And this is the pinnacle
of what you can do in the Netherlands.

887
00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.640
-Great. It's happening.
-Yeah.

888
00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.960
<i>Do you feel the light?</i>

889
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.200
Totally rock style.

890
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.160
Sick.

891
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.680
So great. this.

892
00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.040
-Enjoy it. huh?
-This is totally rock style.

893
00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:33.360
<i>I look around me</i>

894
00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.440
<i>And see the same street</i>

895
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.760
<i>But it suddenly feels as if</i>

896
00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.080
<i>There is a new light here</i>

897
00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.080
<i>Because we dream in color</i>

898
00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.880
I have to say that Freek and I.

899
00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.800
over the past two years.

900
00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:59.200
have dreamed
of a moment like this so often.

901
00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.880
"How long will it take?
When can we finally do it?"

902
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.880
When you think
that everyone there came for you.

903
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:10.040
All singing at the top of their lungs.
That tank of energy.

904
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:13.480
I think that's great. It touches me.

905
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.880
Then you see
all those people standing there.

906
00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.880
The madness.
That's when I did shed a tear.

907
00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.280
It's always fun to play.

908
00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.200
The energy that's released.
it draws you in.

909
00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.560
The way their performances have evolved

910
00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.520
was very clear at the Ziggo Dome.

911
00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.200
You suddenly realize
it's become a really big show.

912
00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.360
Ziggo Dome!

913
00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.120
There are so many people with talent.
and not everyone gets to live it.

914
00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.000
Astonishment.

915
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.040
Pride.

916
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.200
You don't always
have to have much experience

917
00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:15.040
but just trust in yourself and go for it.

918
00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.320
Great!

919
00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.480
-It went well. right?
-Yeah.

920
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.440
It was great. right?

921
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.360
-Are you happy?
-It was crazy.

922
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.920
-Are you happy?
-Yes. really happy. And you?

923
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.560
Hundred percent. Yeah.

924
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.480
Hey. Suus. There she is.

925
00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.200
Hi. Mom.

926
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.280
Hey.

927
00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:50.280
How cool. right?

928
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.520
-Hey. Mom.
-Hi.

929
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.320
-What did you think?
-Oh man.

930
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.880
-I just sat and cried.
-Yeah?

931
00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.360
How wonderful.

932
00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.280
Hey.

933
00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.240
Totally crazy. man.

934
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.160
-Bye.
-Bye.

935
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.600
What a strange feeling.

936
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.480
-Look at this photo.
-Yeah. I forwarded it.

937
00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:17.000
-Vera with your mom.
-Nice. During<i> "Lichtje branden."</i>

938
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.480
How sweet.

939
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.120
Just a couple more chips.

940
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.960
I could really crave the feeling
of what just happened.

941
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.960
-The feeling of happiness is so strong.
-Yeah.

942
00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.000
It's a strange feeling.

943
00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.120
I'm kind of tired. but not tired at all.

944
00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:43.880
-I thought it was great. wasn't it?
-Yeah. right?

945
00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.320
Like you've come
to the top of the mountain.

946
00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.480
"Here we are. The top."

947
00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.840
And then. for the rest of the vacation.

948
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.440
you don't have to worry
about climbing the mountain.

949
00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.080
-Is my alarm already off?
-Yeah. it's off.

950
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:12.920
What do you want?

951
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.840
-What?
-What do you want? Soda?

952
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.400
No. I'll have water or something.

953
00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.720
-Great. right?
-Oh yes.

954
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.120
-I feel really tired now.
-Yeah?

955
00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.680
Whoa. what the fuck? This is sick.

956
00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:36.560
Check it out. It looks so cool.

957
00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.280
You don't see that sitting there.
with the mirror balls.

958
00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.360
Fuck.

959
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.680
-Cool.
-Cool. yeah?

960
00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.040
The outfits are good too.
I'm happy with our outfits.

961
00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.040
-It all went well.
-Yeah.

962
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:50.400
Arie.

963
00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.680
Yeah. Great man.

964
00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.040
My legs are tired. are yours?

965
00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.160
I still have some

966
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.600
of the adrenaline. you know?

967
00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.040
-Yeah.
-I need to come down.

968
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:13.440
VACATION. SEPTEMBER 2022

969
00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.560
Freek?

970
00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.840
-Can you get some water?
-Of course.

971
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.760
-And some…
-Sure.

972
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.160
-Maybe something tasty. some chocolate.
-Of course.

973
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.520
Great.

974
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.840
Sometimes. when I look at old pictures.

975
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.760
when I see us
playing to three people somewhere.

976
00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.040
I think. that's how it was back then.

977
00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:55.960
Yeah.

978
00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:59.840
When I look at photos
of us in a caravan. playing on the street.

979
00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:02.800
Now. I think--

980
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.360
-What an effort.
-What a lot of effort we put in.

981
00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.720
-We really persevered.
-We kept going.

982
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:12.280
We are Suzan & Freek.
Thank you for a lovely evening.

983
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.200
And I was just as happy
doing it for far fewer people.

984
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.520
-I liked it too.
-Now it's even more fun.

985
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.320
That wasn't our motivation for doing it.

986
00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.680
-Otherwise. we might never have begun.
-No.

987
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.280
You get more and more used to it.

988
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.320
I have…

989
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.240
Slowly. it's starting to be the case

990
00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.640
that we see ourselves on that list.

991
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.280
To my mind. I don't think we have changed.

992
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.840
Just the world around us has changed.

993
00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:42.600
More people come to see us.
and people respond differently to us.

994
00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.080
But I'm really happy
that things between us feel the same

995
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.360
and also between us
and our family and friends.

996
00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:54.480
It still really feels like before.
and I think that is--

997
00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.360
-Good that it never went away.
-No.

998
00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.640
You often say. if I wasn't here.
you would have led a different life.

999
00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.200
We've been lucky
that we've had each other.

1000
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.560
It keeps us grounded.

1001
00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.160
But I can imagine.
with everything going on around you…

1002
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.280
It's so intense sometimes.
and it's nice to have a filter in between.

1003
00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:16.040
For some people.
that filter is drinking or something else.

1004
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.440
And I can very well imagine
that that's enjoyable.

1005
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:23.800
But. luckily. we have each other
to share it a bit.

1006
00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.040
Yeah.

1007
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:28.600
What I personally really like.
is when I think

1008
00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.280
that it's actually.

1009
00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.520
I don't want to say "much more fun."

1010
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:36.080
but it's still loads of fun together.
and that's the most important thing.

1011
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.600
I think it's important too.

1012
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:42.920
I think it would be really nice
to combine it with a family at some point.

1013
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.080
That would really be…

1014
00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.520
I would like that very much.

1015
00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.240
<i>Even though the sun sets ten times</i>

1016
00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:56.080
<i>Even though the tide is turning again</i>

1017
00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:01.640
<i>Let me lose myself for a while</i>

1018
00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.920
<i>In a dream</i>

1019
00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:12.800
<i>And then you stand before me again</i>

1020
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:18.400
<i>Even though I may be dreaming</i>

1021
00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:19.800
<i>But there is nothing…</i>

1022
00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.360
-Warm weather now?
-Yeah.

1023
00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.440
Look.

1024
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.360
Gosh. what an animal!

1025
00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:28.000
More exercise than we've had
for the past two weeks.

1026
00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:29.520
Speak for yourself. fatty.

1027
00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.040
Bitch.

1028
00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:35.480
<i>Just use this song as an anchor</i>

1029
00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.160
Suus. you start.

1030
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.000
Can I go on that side?
Then I can see better.

1031
00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.360
This is mental.

1032
00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.560
I can see much better from here.
Yes. that's better.

1033
00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:46.840
Loser does the dishes.

1034
00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.400
-Oh.
-Not even close.

1035
00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:52.440
I'd like to provide
a commentary on your throws.

1036
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.720
Well. pretty close.

1037
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:02.920
I think I feel the pride
more than usual when I'm on vacation.

1038
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.040
I suddenly think.
so. that was really cool. right?

1039
00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:06.960
Yeah.

1040
00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:11.680
Or when we tell someone or show a video
of something we're involved in…

1041
00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.040
Then I suddenly think it's really cool.

1042
00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.840
Stupid. Then I think.
it's nice to enjoy it for once.

1043
00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:19.280
Always so modest. We should also be proud.

1044
00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.240
Wow. This is really cool. right?

1045
00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.160
Yeah?

1046
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:35.600
It's really cool.

1047
00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:40.280
You were sorry that I couldn't enjoy it
as much in the beginning.

1048
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.880
Because I really did enjoy it

1049
00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:44.720
and now and then
you didn't really enjoy it so much.

1050
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.320
On the way home. you would sit in the car

1051
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.760
crying at the thought
of doing it again tomorrow.

1052
00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:52.040
Because I didn't know
if my voice would hold up.

1053
00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:53.000
I found it hard.

1054
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:57.200
-Oh my God.
-Yeah. I know. Great.

1055
00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:02.560
And then I was worried because I saw
you weren't enjoying it as much as I was.

1056
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.280
And I thought. oh…

1057
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.760
Is this speed and intensity…

1058
00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:09.040
Is this what Suzan wants?

1059
00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:13.600
Sometimes I'm a quitter.
I think. I'm not going to do that.

1060
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.240
You're afraid of the unknown.

1061
00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:18.040
Then you say.
"I'd rather keep doing what I…"

1062
00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:21.240
With every concert hall.
you said. "We're doing this one?"

1063
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.840
"No. I'm happy to keep doing the old one."

1064
00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.480
And that was after Ziggo--

1065
00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.160
-I find it more stressful.
-Yeah.

1066
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:31.400
That's also an internal safety mechanism.
which is good.

1067
00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:32.840
Which I sometimes have less.

1068
00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.080
"The fun is in the fear."
but it's still difficult sometimes.

1069
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:39.640
But you're good at that.
and with you. I'm good at it too.

1070
00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:46.880
I really want
to fly a kite in this weather.

1071
00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.680
Beautiful. isn't it?
I love it by the beach. Nice breeze.

1072
00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.680
Yeah. man.

1073
00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:55.000
The Netherlands is really small.
And Belgium. That you…

1074
00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.800
Which is good.
because if it gets too much sometimes.

1075
00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.040
you can simply come here.

1076
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.160
but actually I find it
much too nice to want to leave.

1077
01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.320
LIBERATION DAY FESTIVAL
4 SHOWS ON 1 DAY. MAY 2022

1078
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:14.680
It seemed like all the special things
you can experience as an artist

1079
01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.840
were all scheduled in one month.

1080
01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.160
Good evening. Leeuwarden.

1081
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.280
You look good from up here.

1082
01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.200
Goddamn.

1083
01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.160
We're at the halfway point today.

1084
01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.320
We had Ziggo.

1085
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.360
and then it all started.

1086
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.040
-Sleep at home. as much as possible.
-Yeah.

1087
01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.840
It is a bit too busy.

1088
01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.560
-Ziggo Dome.
-The Ziggo.

1089
01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.640
Then came the first show.
Vrienden van Amstel.

1090
01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.720
then 538 Koningsdag.

1091
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.280
Thank you.

1092
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.400
Six or seven shows. Vrienden van Amstel.

1093
01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.200
ROTTERDAM. MAY 2022

1094
01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.480
Four Liberation Day shows.

1095
01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.960
LIBERATION DAY FESTIVAL
LEEUWARDEN. MAY 2022

1096
01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.440
Four shows. Vrienden van Amstel.

1097
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.200
And so we had 18 in two weeks.

1098
01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.360
Plus all the rehearsals related to it all.

1099
01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.800
You sometimes forget that.

1100
01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:17.080
Can you make sure
we hear Dirk's mic in our ears?

1101
01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.520
But after<i> "Mag ik." </i>we go straight here.

1102
01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.600
-Receive the applause.
-Yes. exactly.

1103
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.640
-Then Dirk sets the groove. and we join.
-That's good. Okay.

1104
01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.640
You have rehearsals for anything new.

1105
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.800
and we rehearsed a lot
before the Ziggo Dome.

1106
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.000
And you sing a lot in private too.

1107
01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.440
So. pretty grueling.

1108
01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.960
<i>It's quiet here on the other side</i>

1109
01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.160
<i>But I come from here</i>

1110
01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.160
That was Snelle.

1111
01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.040
I don't know where they get the energy.

1112
01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:49.520
They're the two hardest working people
that I know.

1113
01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.920
My colleagues and I sometimes
want to have a day when we think

1114
01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:57.160
we'll just skip that set of photos.

1115
01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.360
or we'll walk around
behind the red carpet. that sort of thing.

1116
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.960
But they always have energy

1117
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.480
and are always "on" and can do everything.

1118
01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:11.600
I see them working. then afterwards.
just the two of them in a corner

1119
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.960
being themselves. and I think…

1120
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.680
I admire how they can always turn it on.

1121
01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.640
to always be Suzan & Freek.

1122
01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:26.920
I'm happy that was the last show
and that we persevered with it all.

1123
01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.160
-And that I had a good time.
-And then you're right there again.

1124
01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.960
I'd rather skip an after-party
and do an extra show

1125
01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.960
because I find after-parties so…

1126
01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.480
I'll do them in a few years

1127
01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:41.800
when I'm no longer enjoying it.
then I'll celebrate all my parties.

1128
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.480
Now. I think.
we've got all the cool festivals.

1129
01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.560
-Surely you can't miss that?
-Yeah.

1130
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.480
No.

1131
01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.560
I think. how things are now.

1132
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.320
just being very respectable

1133
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.600
with no drugs. no rock 'n' roll. you know?

1134
01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.960
Thank God they don't have that.

1135
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.200
Sometimes a bit.
which is too bad. but fine.

1136
01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.200
But it's just really nice. you know?

1137
01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:07.240
They are so steady. but not boring.

1138
01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.800
And I think.

1139
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.600
if you can keep that up
over the long term.

1140
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.960
you can take on the whole world.

1141
01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.200
If I go to bed late. I can't manage.

1142
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.400
We have to push on a bit.

1143
01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.640
I think it's important to do it well.

1144
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.040
That you don't think.

1145
01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.360
"If I'd just done my best
and gone to fewer after-parties

1146
01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.840
because it didn't sound good."
I'd find that annoying.

1147
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.080
I wouldn't want that.

1148
01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.560
It has to be good. And fun. and good.

1149
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.800
I'm always a bit scared
and think. "As long as it goes well."

1150
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.280
We can still walk.

1151
01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.000
LIBERATION DAY FESTIVAL
ASSEN. MAY 2022

1152
01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.760
-Hello.
-Hi. Time for a quick photo?

1153
01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.720
We have to perform. sorry.

1154
01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:56.440
You can't have photos
with everyone at a show anymore.

1155
01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.880
I used to do it all the time
earlier this year.

1156
01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:03.040
We'd spend an hour and a half
after the show taking photos with people.

1157
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.400
and then I realized

1158
01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.520
it was starting to take more energy
than the show itself.

1159
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.960
Now that one.
now we have to finish the row.

1160
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.680
Half an hour. grimacing…

1161
01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.320
But if you do that every night.
you realize it can't continue.

1162
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.000
"Suzan & Freek. don't do it!"

1163
01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.600
Then I think. how bad.
We really shouldn't do that.

1164
01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.680
I find it pathetic.
So that's tricky at times. yes.

1165
01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.200
-Nice.
-Great. guys.

1166
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.760
-We'll get you straight on the bus.
-What was that?

1167
01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.040
-We'll put you straight on the bus.
-Yeah. great.

1168
01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:57.760
Holy shit.

1169
01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.600
-The show was cool. right?
-It was.

1170
01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.880
I'm gonna sit on the floor.
Then they won't see me.

1171
01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.360
-My abs.
-Exactly.

1172
01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.440
This is nice.

1173
01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.240
Oh my God.

1174
01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.760
Funny. I thought they wouldn't see me now.

1175
01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.560
I look up and everyone is
watching me sitting on the floor.

1176
01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:18.520
All waving.

1177
01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.280
Can you pull that curtain shut?

1178
01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.440
I'll sit for a moment.

1179
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.520
Otherwise. I always feel so…

1180
01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.160
Thank you.

1181
01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.000
I think we're very approachable.
which is what we want to be. and we are.

1182
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.080
But that sometimes

1183
01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.160
has the disadvantage
that everyone comes up to you.

1184
01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.240
Which is sometimes really nice.
but sometimes not so much.

1185
01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.840
When I go to a restaurant
with Freek and my parents

1186
01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:51.080
and we sit next to a table
with a young girl.

1187
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.320
And she begins to cry
out of panic at seeing us.

1188
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.920
And I find it intense to have that effect.

1189
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.280
that everything around us has changed.

1190
01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.640
Everyone is waiting here.

1191
01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.960
-Can you see?
-Hello.

1192
01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.160
Oh. how bad. I feel so bad.
-No. that's not bad.

1193
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.000
They're waiting.
They want a photo and we're in the bus.

1194
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.720
I wish there were some blinds.

1195
01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.080
-Shouldn't we go for a photo?
-You'll be there for over an hour.

1196
01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:19.440
-There are so many people.
-Okay. that's fine.

1197
01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.280
With some things.
I feel it's getting more difficult.

1198
01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.000
When I walk by an elementary school
and the entire yard shouts my name.

1199
01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:30.240
I think. shit. maybe I shouldn't
walk past a schoolyard anymore.

1200
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.640
Then never walk past a schoolyard again?
That's crazy.

1201
01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.600
Can you turn the camera off? Thanks.

1202
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.680
On stage. it's okay.
It's more the stuff around it.

1203
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.800
Yes. Everyone just runs around
taking photos all the time.

1204
01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.080
You think.
just leave me alone for a second.

1205
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.240
Keep walking.

1206
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.800
-Nice that it's just the two of us.
-Yeah. great.

1207
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.560
I'm the happiest when it's the two of us
in the car heading home.

1208
01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:13.320
Because then everyone around us is gone
and it's just the two of us for a while.

1209
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.760
Isn't it crazy.
what we're experiencing. you know?

1210
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.000
That's what makes me the happiest.

1211
01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.760
-Right?
-Yes. honey. I like it too.

1212
01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.960
It's on here.
the busiest period of the year.

1213
01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.760
-We made it. Until the end.
-Yeah. right?

1214
01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.560
It was a lot. but it was great.

1215
01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.560
Nineteen shows in seventeen days.

1216
01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.760
and each show for more than 15.000 people.

1217
01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:46.000
I think that's pretty intense.

1218
01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:49.720
And we were thinking.
can we do this? Will it work?

1219
01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.920
Can the crew handle all these shows?
Will it work technically?

1220
01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.760
-Will your voice hold out?
-Will it hold out?

1221
01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.080
But it all went great.
so now the rest of the year…

1222
01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.960
Surely now it will be fine.

1223
01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.000
BUSSUM. MAY 2022

1224
01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:10.640
Important day.

1225
01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:15.640
Hey. hello.

1226
01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.920
-Hey. hello.
-Journalist from the<i> Weekend.</i>

1227
01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.720
What a life you're living.
Compared to a couple of years ago.

1228
01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.120
-You have to think. what happened?
-Yeah.

1229
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.480
-Do you experience it the same way?
-Yeah. The last month in particular was…

1230
01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.920
-The guy just came right up to me.
-Yes. but you mustn't do that.

1231
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.160
That's the <i>Weekend</i>. We don't talk to them.

1232
01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.200
Can you just check? Whether he…

1233
01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:47.560
Say that they should let us see it.

1234
01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.920
Or just get rid of it.
We didn't actually want to talk with him.

1235
01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.800
We once had an interview where
someone was taunting us with questions

1236
01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.600
in the hopes we would snap.
I can't remember what it was.

1237
01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.120
but it's always
about something very personal.

1238
01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:04.880
While I'm there thinking.
we've written a new song.

1239
01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.120
Maybe you should ask about that.

1240
01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.480
-I should have walked away.
-I was looking for you.

1241
01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:12.880
I was there thinking. "Should I. yes. no?"

1242
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.960
That was in the course of the questions.

1243
01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.200
Suzan. hello.

1244
01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.600
I think there is
always a certain line between…

1245
01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:24.920
who we are as artists
and what is truly private. for us alone.

1246
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.720
And I think that's something

1247
01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:32.080
we have to think hard about
to keep things chill for us.

1248
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.920
This might be a heavy question
to ask right at the start.

1249
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.720
but do you guys have a type of wildcard?

1250
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.640
In case you want
to dance with someone else or…

1251
01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:44.600
Separately.

1252
01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.600
-What a strange question.
-A wildcard.

1253
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.200
We have an open relationship… no.

1254
01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.040
-No. we don't have a wildcard.
-No.

1255
01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.400
In my head. I'm kind of thinking

1256
01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.920
that I want to tell <i>100% Nederland.</i>

1257
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:03.720
"Cut out that bit about the wildcard."
Because I…

1258
01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.120
What's private needs to remain private.

1259
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:10.560
That's the last piece of us
that we still own.

1260
01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.760
Here. your pass.

1261
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.920
-Thank you.
-Great.

1262
01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:16.000
I think we're saying
that the story about the wildcard--

1263
01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.080
That can be taken out.
Then he'll understand.

1264
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.040
-Is that okay?
-Yes. I want…

1265
01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:24.640
We've become entertainers.
And we're also still just people.

1266
01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.920
Sometimes you notice…
You wouldn't ask your friends that.

1267
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.920
It's not very respectful. actually.

1268
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.200
What do you think?
The question is awkward.

1269
01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.520
-Maybe you shouldn't ask it then.
-Exactly.

1270
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.000
It goes far. I think.

1271
01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.880
What they do with people. they…

1272
01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.400
But that applies to everyone.
Everyone is under the microscope.

1273
01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.560
If anything happens here in the village.

1274
01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.320
then everyone talks about it for a week.

1275
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.920
And the following week.
they talk about something else.

1276
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.440
But in the world of fame.
it's really hard right now. I think.

1277
01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:58.400
And sometimes it's nothing
but it gets so widely reported.

1278
01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.120
That doesn't make you happy.
But it's independent of them.

1279
01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.040
It's the case for everyone.
I don't like it.

1280
01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.920
I hear some people ask.

1281
01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.400
"Isn't it hard
working with your partner all day

1282
01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.920
and seeing them in private?"

1283
01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.560
Well. we had a farm. so…

1284
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.720
It isn't hard.

1285
01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.160
If you're with someone
you like being around

1286
01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.400
and who you work well with.

1287
01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.440
it's not annoying at all.

1288
01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.600
We've never found it annoying.
and we don't see that in them either.

1289
01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.680
It's crazy that people
are interested in the first place.

1290
01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.680
LOOSDRECHT LAKES
AUGUST 2022

1291
01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.360
I'll have an Aperol. Bang!

1292
01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.680
But we have…

1293
01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.760
I have four glasses.

1294
01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.800
I wanted to bring truffle. Suus said no.

1295
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.360
There's beer. But no…

1296
01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440
Here's another one.

1297
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.920
No. that can't be.

1298
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.320
There's cork in it.

1299
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.560
-Cork.
-Cork.

1300
01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.080
Well…

1301
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.560
At the beginning of this busy period.
it was hard

1302
01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.600
because we saw each other less.

1303
01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.640
And that was difficult.

1304
01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:12.320
But I've noticed

1305
01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.520
that a certain small club of people
formed around me

1306
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.600
that has become smaller over time

1307
01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.200
and that I want to see more.

1308
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.560
I'm really very conventional. Yes.

1309
01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.160
That's true. Yes.

1310
01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.360
But it strikes me
that a lot of people are.

1311
01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.520
Then I think.

1312
01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.160
how nice that we found each other.
because we get along well.

1313
01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.040
I'm not one for full-on parties.
I don't stay up late often.

1314
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.200
I don't drink. don't do drugs.
I'm really quite boring.

1315
01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.040
But I do like
doing nice things with my friends

1316
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.400
and having a good time
with people I care about.

1317
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.760
But. on the other hand. conventional…

1318
01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:55.320
I do really great shows.
So what exactly is cool?

1319
01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.920
Getting blind drunk on the weekend

1320
01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.240
or playing a concert for 40.000 people?
So. yeah…

1321
01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.840
Yes. maybe I am a bit conventional.

1322
01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.880
but I find myself to be pretty cool
with what we do.

1323
01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.600
I've noticed that spending time together
doesn't consume any energy.

1324
01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.680
We're good at being together.

1325
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.800
sometimes without having to say anything.

1326
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.440
It lets us both recharge.

1327
01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:44.120
And it isn't the case
that we view it as an activity.

1328
01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.040
"Let's do something together now."

1329
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:49.400
We just enjoy being together
and that. yeah…

1330
01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:52.680
I don't really think about it.
I just find…

1331
01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.920
If I want to go cycling.
I'll say. "Want to come for a ride?"

1332
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.240
Then we'll go cycling together.
I prefer that to being alone.

1333
01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.680
We could fill up our entire week.
Requests for TV things

1334
01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:07.640
and interview for this.
we could appear in Belgium for this…

1335
01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:10.480
But I said to Freek.
"I don't want to be so busy."

1336
01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.360
I just don't want that.
I also want to have a nice life.

1337
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.480
<i>Maybe kissed</i>

1338
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.720
<i>Fathers and mothers</i>

1339
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.400
<i>A little laughter too at everyone</i>

1340
01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.360
<i>Now it feels exactly as it used to</i>

1341
01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.440
<i>You and I</i>
<i>The world at my feet</i>

1342
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.960
<i>When I looked at you</i>

1343
01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.040
<i>I suddenly became</i>

1344
01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.440
<i>Someone from the past again</i>

1345
01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.440
<i>-See you.</i>
<i>-Bye.</i>

1346
01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.840
-See you later.
-Have fun.

1347
01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:44.960
-Bye.
-Later.

1348
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.440
-An hour…
-Yes. just that.

1349
01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.240
-Accordion.
-Accordion.

1350
01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:53.960
-Funny going to a show like this.
-Yeah. right?

1351
01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.200
When do we do this now?

1352
01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.480
I remember well that we…

1353
01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.520
Just before corona. we were in the meadow.

1354
01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.360
Kraantje Pappie was on the main stage.

1355
01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.320
-We said. "Great show."
-Yeah.

1356
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.680
Big stage.
with the big "Daddy" at the back.

1357
01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.440
-I thought. "That guy's made it."
-Yeah.

1358
01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.800
Well. let's go then.

1359
01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:19.480
I think I'm still very keen
to make people happy.

1360
01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.320
And I want people to like me

1361
01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.080
and like what I do.

1362
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.000
So. maybe I.

1363
01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.640
above all<i>.</i>

1364
01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.320
should try a little harder to accept

1365
01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.760
that there is a large group that like it.

1366
01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:36.960
I should be happy with that.
We're successful in what we do.

1367
01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:38.520
People come to our shows.

1368
01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.080
And I try very much
to look at what we do have

1369
01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.920
and the people who like it. instead of…

1370
01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.960
the people who maybe don't like it

1371
01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:49.920
and feel the need to say that or… Yeah.

1372
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.440
-Have fun.
-I still find it quite exciting.

1373
01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.760
-Exciting. right?
-Suus.

1374
01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.000
-I find it horribly scary.
-Exciting. huh?

1375
01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.840
-Nice to have you here.
-Super cool.

1376
01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:00.080
-Horribly scary.
-It will be all right.

1377
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:02.960
You can tell by looking at you.
you really are all…

1378
01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.160
Just take a deep breath.

1379
01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:07.320
-The first song. then you'll be okay.
-Yeah. that's right.

1380
01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.480
Then I'll be back.

1381
01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.800
It will be fine.

1382
01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:12.880
You're wearing a gorgeous outfit.

1383
01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.960
I'm glad you guys are here.

1384
01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.360
-Good that you're all here.
-Good you're here. man.

1385
01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.360
The Zwarte Cross
is the festival of The Achterhoek.

1386
01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.600
Freek is never afraid to think big.

1387
01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.040
although I don't think he ever dared dream

1388
01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.200
that they would play
the main stage at Zwarte Cross.

1389
01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.440
Get yourself together.

1390
01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.440
Holy shit. man.

1391
01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.960
Suus was literally 200 meters
from the main stage cooking fries.

1392
01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.880
She never dared dream
that she would ever stand up there.

1393
01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.560
They haven't been so big for long.

1394
01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.880
but if I know them

1395
01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.400
and they keep doing what they want.

1396
01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.120
I think they'll keep going
for a long time.

1397
01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.760
Until they're 80 or something.

1398
01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.280
This is it. guys.

1399
01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.960
Zwarte Cross. here…

1400
01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.920
Suzan & Freek!

1401
01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.520
Zwarte Cross. good afternoon!

1402
01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.280
<i>But weren't we gold?</i>

1403
01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:30.160
<i>Tell me. what if I can never forget you</i>?

1404
01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:34.920
<i>Now suddenly you're gone</i>

1405
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
<i>But it doesn't yet really feel</i>

1406
01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.640
<i>As if I can do this</i>

1407
01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.960
<i>Do you think it's easy. perhaps</i>?

1408
01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.640
<i>You're haunting my thoughts</i>

1409
01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:49.640
<i>Because I still believe in us</i>

1410
01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.040
<i>But weren't we gold?</i>

1411
01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.080
<i>Tell me. what if I can never forget you</i>?

1412
01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.320
<i>What if I can never forget you</i>?

1413
01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:03.560
How great it is.
as someone from Achterhoek.

1414
01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:06.120
to stand in front of so many people.

1415
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.400
You want to share this
with the people you hold dear.

1416
01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.400
To see Suzan and Freek.
and all those people…

1417
01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.760
Where are all my people
from The Achterhoek?

1418
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.040
Great. yeah? Nice.

1419
01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.840
We also try

1420
01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.160
to involve family and friends a bit more.

1421
01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:31.200
That's maybe because
we found it more challenging before.

1422
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.720
and then you don't let other people in

1423
01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:38.040
because you think. I'm busy enough
with making sure it's all good.

1424
01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.000
Now we have the space and the control

1425
01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:45.240
to let friends and family
literally stand next to us on stage

1426
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.520
and watch along.

1427
01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.160
And I'm very happy with that.

1428
01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.720
Then the two worlds blend together more.

1429
01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:54.040
Zwarte Cross.
may I have your loudest applause

1430
01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.800
for none other than Snelle!

1431
01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:02.520
This is such a moment of realization
for all three of us

1432
01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.760
that we're up here in front of you
today at the Zwarte Cross.

1433
01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.480
The best festival of the year.

1434
01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.160
The fields are packed full everywhere.

1435
01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.480
It's a 60-minute set.

1436
01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:17.960
and there's only one song
where you might not know a few lines.

1437
01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:21.920
For the rest. everyone sings along.
because they're the biggest right now.

1438
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.560
<i>It's quiet here on the other side</i>

1439
01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.440
<i>But I come from here</i>

1440
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.680
<i>Where your bike can be left</i>

1441
01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.560
<i>By the roadside unlocked</i>

1442
01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.880
<i>It's quiet here on the other side…</i>

1443
01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.200
You can be louder.

1444
01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.080
As out of tune as you can.

1445
01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.440
<i>It's quiet here on the other side</i>…

1446
01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:44.400
-More off-key and louder.
-Come on.

1447
01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:48.440
<i>It's quiet here on the other side</i>…

1448
01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.720
-We're almost there.
-Yeah!

1449
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.720
<i>It's quiet here on the other side</i>…

1450
01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.720
Zwarte Cross. let me hear you!

1451
01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.520
<i>It's quiet here on the other side</i>

1452
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.120
<i>But I come from here</i>

1453
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.680
<i>Where your bike can be left</i>

1454
01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.520
<i>By the roadside unlocked</i>

1455
01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.720
I think that we did dream of it. yes.

1456
01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:23.720
I never thought that we would do this.

1457
01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.520
I always thought
I had to do something really special.

1458
01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.040
And I'm simply doing the same as always.

1459
01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.200
and suddenly I can live
from the music alone.

1460
01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:38.920
Yes. I'm happy
with where we are now and who we are.

1461
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.560
We belong there now.

1462
01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.640
Before. I thought
we were simply visitors. you know?

1463
01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.360
As if everyone had made a mistake.

1464
01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.320
They didn't realize
that we were standing among them.

1465
01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:54.120
Now. after corona.
I feel more like we belong there.

1466
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.520
That it suddenly got so big.

1467
01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:01.320
I had never thought about it.
And I think it's really great.

1468
01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.480
Zwarte Crossers!

1469
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.200
We love you!

1470
01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.760
WITH SPECIAL THANKS TO
SUZAN & FREEK

1471
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.920
<i>I look around me</i>

1472
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
<i>And see the same street</i>

1473
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.520
<i>But it suddenly feels as if</i>

1474
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.920
<i>There is a new light here</i>

1475
01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.840
<i>For all my life</i>

1476
01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.920
<i>I passed it by</i>

1477
01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.280
<i>But what I never saw</i>

1478
01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.400
<i>You now release in me</i>

1479
01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.800
<i>That it can be so beautiful here</i>

1480
01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:46.480
<i>Do you feel the light</i>…

1481
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:49.320
And it has become our work.
but in this room it feels

1482
01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.440
as if we're still
doing it for fun. which is true.

1483
01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.240
I've never told Suzan
that we earn money from it.

1484
01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.640
-Keep it that way.
-Yeah.

1485
01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.560
Last week you were
wearing a body warmer. what was that?

1486
01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:03.200
Was that a statement or something?
What was it?

1487
01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.200
I thought. that can't be true.

1488
01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.520
Why did you do that? Now you mention it.

1489
01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.280
-What was that?
-You can do that. It's hip.

1490
01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.880
-Is it really hip?
-Yes. it's hip.

1491
01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:14.560
I sometimes lag behind.
but I thought. Freek!

1492
01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.960
-Is it really hip?
-Yes. it's really hip.

1493
01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:18.920
Yes?

1494
01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.520
Also. the shoes with those narrow trousers

1495
01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:29.400
and that large jacket. I thought. why?

1496
01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:33.640
Why is everyone
wearing such a large jacket?

1497
01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:38.320
-If you like it. you should do it.
-No. but yes. Okay.

1498
01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.840
A little tent. or not?

1499
01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:48.000
-Cheers. guys.
-Yeah. guys.

1500
01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.760
There's a fly near you all the time.

1501
01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.840
-Did you wash?
-Wash?

1502
01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.360
Dung fly.

1503
01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.640
<i>But it is real</i>

1504
01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.360
<i>Since you are here</i>

1505
01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:05.600
<i>I see everything differently</i>
<i>To how I know it</i>

1506
01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:09.000
<i>Hope that it never goes</i>

1507
01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:13.000
<i>Because we dream in color</i>

1508
01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.680
<i>Everything seems</i>

1509
01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:29.400
<i>More beautiful</i>. <i>now I'm looking</i>

1510
01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.520
<i>With you</i>

1511
01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.880
<i>Can you feel the light?</i>

1512
01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.960
<i>Can you taste the mist</i>?

1513
01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.520
<i>Easy to say that it's unreal</i>

1514
01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.880
