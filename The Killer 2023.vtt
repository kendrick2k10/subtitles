1031
01:30:38.791 --> 01:30:40.500

there's nothing there.

And then <i>suddenly.</i>

1034
01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.166
the grizzly throws this massive arm
around his shoulders and explains.

1035
01:30:51.375 --> 01:30:52.333
"You took your shot."

1036

the hunter returns to the woods

1042
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:12.375

and he spots the bear again.

1043

And he aims. He fires. The bear falls.

1044

The hunter charges.

1045
01:31:17.541 --> 01:31:20.541
No sign of the bear.

1222

So nobody gets crazy.

1235
01:45:42.875 --> 01:45:45.083

1236
01:45:45.166 --> 01:45:46.250

1240
01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I don't keep cash here.

1241
01:45:59.958 --> 01:46:01.958
But I can have some delivered. <i>No?</i>

1242
01:46:02.041 --> 01:46:05.750
Okay. well. what is it <i>exactly</i>
I can do for you?

1243
01:46:06.250 --> 01:46:10.333
I came to show you how easily
one might get to you. Mr. Claybourne.

1244
01:46:11.166 --> 01:46:13.458
And to ask. <i>do you and I have a problem?</i>

1245
01:46:13.541 --> 01:46:16.125
[scoffs] Do <i>we</i>… What? A problem?

1246
01:46:16.208 --> 01:46:18.208
No. of course not.

1247
01:46:19.583 --> 01:46:21.500
Am I <i>supposed </i>to know who you are?

1248
01:46:21.583 --> 01:46:25.250
Because my memory for names
and faces isn't what it used to be.

1249
01:46:34.833 --> 01:46:35.958
All right.

1250

[exhales]

1251
01:46:42.833 --> 01:46:44.208
There's an address.

1252
01:46:44.708 --> 01:46:47.500
It's 3 Rue du Grev…

1253
01:46:48.416 --> 01:46:50.125
I'm still not-- [exhales]

1254
01:46:53.375 --> 01:46:54.416
Oh.

1255
01:46:55.083 --> 01:46:57.166
Oh.

1256
01:46:57.250 --> 01:46:58.500
[calmly] Wait.

1257
01:47:01.791 --> 01:47:02.875
<i>You.</i>

1258
01:47:06.083 --> 01:47:07.750
I didn't <i>realize</i>.

1259
01:47:08.333 --> 01:47:09.958
Please hear me out.

1260
01:47:10.041 --> 01:47:12.500
To answer your question.
we have <i>no </i>problem.

1261
01:47:12.583 --> 01:47:16.041
I harbor no ill will
about anything that may have happened.

1262
01:47:16.125 --> 01:47:17.166
Or not happened.

1263
01:47:17.250 --> 01:47:19.583
Let me make that crystal clear.

1264
01:47:21.208 --> 01:47:25.250
Right after the. uh… <i>incident</i>.
I received a phone call.

1265
01:47:25.333 --> 01:47:28.750
I was told that things had gone sideways.

1266
01:47:29.333 --> 01:47:32.041
My response was. "Nobody's perfect."

1267
01:47:32.625 --> 01:47:37.166
Now. I did. <i>I admit</i>. inquire as to what
is normally done in these circumstances.

1268
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:40.666
And they… he. <i>the lawyer fella</i>. Hedges.

1269
01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:43.208
suggested that in this very rare case.

1270
01:47:43.291 --> 01:47:47.458
I might wish to arrange for insurance
to prevent any <i>blowback</i>.

1271
01:47:47.541 --> 01:47:48.791
I remember thinking.

1272
01:47:48.875 --> 01:47:51.916
"Now. why in the world
is this liability mine?"

1273
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.833
I mean. you have to please understand
this entire--

1274
01:47:56.333 --> 01:47:58.541
I was very <i>new </i>to this kind of thing.

1275
01:47:58.625 --> 01:48:02.666
I bled a little ink. so <i>yeah</i>.
Selfishly. I didn't want any blowback.

1276
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:06.541
And so. eventually.
we agreed that for an <i>additional </i>150k

1277
01:48:06.625 --> 01:48:08.500
the trail could be <i>scrubbed</i>.

1278
01:48:08.583 --> 01:48:11.666
That was literally all I was told.
"Cleanup on aisle three."

1279
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:13.500
His words. not mine.

1280
01:48:13.583 --> 01:48:16.458
And so. I made sure
there was enough in escrow

1281
01:48:16.541 --> 01:48:18.375
and never thought about it again.

1282
01:48:18.875 --> 01:48:19.791
<i>Until…</i>

1283
01:48:21.916 --> 01:48:22.916
[sighs]

1284
01:48:23.541 --> 01:48:27.625
What I'm trying to say here.
and I can't express this strongly enough.

1285
01:48:27.708 --> 01:48:30.291
I have <i>no </i>issue with you.

1286
01:48:30.375 --> 01:48:31.500
Zero.

1287
01:48:32.625 --> 01:48:34.208
As far as I'm concerned.

1288
01:48:35.875 --> 01:48:37.125
we're good.

1289
01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.291
I'm curious.

1290
01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:44.708
I break into your home

1291
01:48:44.791 --> 01:48:47.208
in the middle of the night
with a <i>silenced </i>pistol.

1292
01:48:48.041 --> 01:48:51.458
and you have <i>no </i>idea why I might be here?

1293
01:48:58.250 --> 01:49:00.041
If I have to come back.

1294
01:49:01.083 --> 01:49:04.375
maybe a radioactive speck
on the lip of your favorite coffee mug.

1295
01:49:05.583 --> 01:49:09.500
A slow death. mind you.
from painful facial necrosis.

1296

Or a tragic misstep
into your penthouse elevator shaft.

1297
01:49:13.541 --> 01:49:14.833
But I <i>promise</i>.

1298
01:49:15.875 --> 01:49:17.541
