00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.809
I can't believe you still have
to stuff your bra. Sommer.

4
00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:44.011
Everybody doesn't
have boobs yet. Brandi.

5
00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:46.413
True. Not everybody can be me.

6
00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.982
Plus. Mike's going to be there.

7
00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:49.917
and I'm trying
to lose it tonight.

8
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:51.751
You're such a whore.

9
00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.856
Okay. guys. Come on. Focus.

10
00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:56.656
- Are we all good?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.893
- Yeah.
- I don't know. Brandi.

12
00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.694
Don't you think
it's a little mean?

13
00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.064
I mean. everyone already
picks on him all the time.

14
00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:06.901
Really. Nicole? You know what?
Forget it. I'll just do it.

15
00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.804
You can be left out
while we have all the fun.

16
00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.038
Right. ladies?

17
00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:12.173
- Right.
- Right.

18
00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:15.508
No. no. no. I'm in. I'll do it.

19
00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:18.645
Okay. I knew you weren't stupid.

20
00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:21.082
Okay. everybody. Hands in.

21
00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:24.417
From this night on. you swear to
make a pact to never let boys.

22
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:28.089
teachers. parents. anyone.
or anything come between us.

23
00:01:28.122 --> 00:01:29.156
Got it?

24
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.724
- Got it.
- Got it.

25
00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.961
Whatever happens to us.
we stick together.

26
00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:36.496
Our bond is always
and forever.

27
00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:40.067
Come on.

28
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:41.434
Say it!

29
00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.637
Always and forever.

30
00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.071
Hey. hey.

31
00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:52.605
Mom. Hey.

32
00:03:11.192 --> 00:03:13.995
Son. I am so proud of you.

33
00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:16.297
You are everything I hoped for
and even more.

34
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.566
You just make a mother so proud.

35
00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.836
Testing. hello.

36
00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:27.274
I just want to say
how truly lucky I am

37
00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:29.642
to have found
this woman of my dreams.

38
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.849
I will love you always
and forever.

39
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.262
Wedding parties do a video.

40
00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:50.097
Hey. hey.

41
00:03:50.131 --> 00:03:53.566
This is my wife now. Back up.

42
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.269
Nicole. what can I say?

43
00:03:55.302 --> 00:03:58.939
You are a princess and Brian.
he's just...

44
00:03:58.973 --> 00:04:01.574
he is Prince Charming. girl.

45
00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:03.110
Hey.

46
00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:14.721
Oh. I just want to say
that I am so happy for you.

47
00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.090
You've finally got
what you wanted.

48
00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:19.026
He put a ring on it.
as you deserve.

49
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.593
Just want you to know
that I'm next

50
00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:23.297
and you will be
at my wedding very soon.

51
00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:30.037
Hey. beautiful. It's Sommer.

52
00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:32.073
I just want to wish you
many years of happiness.

53
00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:34.641
and I love you so much.

54
00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:11.979
- Hey. babe.
- Hey.

55
00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.952
What's wrong?

56
00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:19.887
Nothing.

57
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.155
You know I know you

58
00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:22.890
better than you know yourself.
right?

59
00:05:22.923 --> 00:05:24.425
Come on.

60
00:05:24.458 --> 00:05:26.693
Well then you would know
that I hate it

61
00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:28.761
when you are gone so much.

62
00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:30.331
Babe. we talked about this.

63
00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:32.867
And you know I would have
never even taken that job

64
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.268
if I knew how it was
going to affect you.

65
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:37.037
I know. It's just
we've both been really busy

66
00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:39.140
and I feel like we haven't been
able to spend any time together.

67
00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:40.941
- I miss you.
- You miss me.

68
00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:42.376
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

69
00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.012
- Well. guess what?
- What?

70
00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:48.949
Think I can skip this trip. and
you can have me all to yourself.

71
00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:51.886
- I like that.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

72
00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:55.222
Think I'll be a little late.

73
00:06:00.928 --> 00:06:03.931
Tall mocha latte with soy
and a pinch of vanilla.

74
00:06:03.964 --> 00:06:07.401
I know. Are you ever
going to change your order?

75
00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.370
At least you know
I'm consistent.

76
00:06:09.403 --> 00:06:11.138
That is true.

77
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.976
Here you go.
and it'll be right out.

78
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.279
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

79
00:06:18.312 --> 00:06:19.779
Hi.

80
00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:30.858
Nicole?

81
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.961
Oh. my God. Miranda.

82
00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:35.728
- How are you?
- How are you?

83
00:06:35.762 --> 00:06:37.131
Good to see you.
What are you...

84
00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:38.832
Look at you.
First of all. you look amazing.

85
00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.834
- Sit down. sit down. please.
- Oh. thank you.

86
00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:42.303
What are you doing here?

87
00:06:42.336 --> 00:06:45.105
Oh. I just came back
from South Africa.

88
00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.808
South Africa?
What were you doing there?

89
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:50.743
Apparently saving animals
has become my life passion now.

90
00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:52.213
- What?
- Can you believe it?

91
00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:55.049
- I know. right?
- Wow. that's amazing.

92
00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:57.384
And I met a guy.
He's a doctor.

93
00:06:57.418 --> 00:06:59.253
I know. Can you believe it? Me?

94
00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:01.922
I never did nerds.
and here I am.

95
00:07:01.956 --> 00:07:05.159
How about you? I haven't
seen you since the wedding.

96
00:07:05.192 --> 00:07:07.928
Married life is everything
I could have asked for

97
00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:09.196
and then some.

98
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.763
You'll have to
come by the house.

99
00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.466
Any time.
Number's still the same?

100
00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:13.901
- Yes. yes.
- Okay.

101
00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:15.236
Please call me
so we can catch up.

102
00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:17.004
Definitely.
So good to see you.

103
00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:19.006
- It's good to see you too.
- I'mma let you back to work.

104
00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:21.141
- Alright. Bye. Miranda.
- Bye.

105
00:07:34.822 --> 00:07:39.159
Whoo!
This is going to look so good.

106
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.832
Oh. we gonna get some tonight.

107
00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:49.903
Ohh.

108
00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:53.540
Stupid alarm.

109
00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:19.500
Stupid car.

110
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:35.883
Hello?

111
00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:46.527
Hello?

112
00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:58.372
No. no. no. No. no. no.

113
00:09:08.382 --> 00:09:09.917
<i>What up? It's D.
You got me.</i>

114
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:11.218
<i>Leave your message at the beep.</i>

115
00:10:20.587 --> 00:10:22.356
No!

116
00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:25.459
Help!

117
00:10:53.053 --> 00:10:55.656
<i>In other news.

118
00:10:55.689 --> 00:10:58.058
<i>at her Los Angeles home
last night.</i>

119
00:10:58.091 --> 00:11:00.661
<i>Sources say it was a suicide.</i>

120
00:11:00.694 --> 00:11:03.230
- <i>Back you. John.</i>
- Oh. my God.

121
00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:04.665
<i>There are growing
questions about possible...</i>

122
00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:09.536
Hey. You okay?

123
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.172
Yeah.

124
00:11:12.206 --> 00:11:14.341
When was the last time
you saw her?

125
00:11:14.374 --> 00:11:17.010
Just yesterday at the cafÃ©.

126
00:11:17.044 --> 00:11:19.146
Oh.

127
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:24.384
Suicide? I mean. I just would
never have expected that.

128
00:11:24.418 --> 00:11:25.752
She seemed so happy.

129
00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:28.055
She was raving about this doctor
she'd just met

130
00:11:28.088 --> 00:11:31.225
and how she wanted to
get married and everything.

131
00:11:31.258 --> 00:11:33.760
Mm.

132
00:11:33.794 --> 00:11:37.464
Well. how about this. hmm?

133
00:11:37.498 --> 00:11:42.469
You stop thinking about it.
we order your favorite Chinese.

134
00:11:42.503 --> 00:11:44.771
maybe watch a movie. talk.

135
00:11:44.806 --> 00:11:47.774
get your mind off
the stress of the day?

136
00:11:47.809 --> 00:11:52.145
I like that.

137
00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:54.681
- I love you.
- I love you too.

138
00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.548
I just can't believe she's gone.

139
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:31.385
It's unbelievable.

140
00:12:31.418 --> 00:12:33.587
I'm just like...

141
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.823
Is that Brandi?

142
00:12:35.857 --> 00:12:37.859
Oh.

143
00:12:37.892 --> 00:12:41.863
Brandi Smith.
What a pleasant surprise.

144
00:12:41.896 --> 00:12:44.832
It is nice to see you too.
Sommer.

145
00:12:44.866 --> 00:12:47.134
I see not much has changed.

146
00:12:49.904 --> 00:12:53.473
It's good to see you guys
after all this time.

147
00:12:53.507 --> 00:12:55.676
Sorry I couldn't come
to your wedding. Nicole.

148
00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:57.344
You know. traveling the world.
you know.

149
00:12:57.377 --> 00:13:00.681
Totally understandable.

150
00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:03.250
This must be the lucky guy?

151
00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:06.153
Yes. Brandi. Brian.

152
00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:07.487
Nice to meet you.

153
00:13:07.521 --> 00:13:09.623
Nice to meet you too.

154
00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:13.260
Unfortunate it has
to be this circumstance.

155
00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:16.363
Yeah. it is.

156
00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:17.731
She was good people.

157
00:13:19.733 --> 00:13:21.468
- She was.
- Yeah.

158
00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:26.908
Well. here.

159
00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:29.209
Hey. here's my card.

160
00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:35.415
You both should stop
by the boutique sometime.

161
00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:38.619
- That'd be nice.
- Yeah.

162
00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.253
See ya.

163
00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:47.461
Really?

164
00:13:47.494 --> 00:13:49.763
- I cannot stand that girl.
- I know. I know.

165
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.720
- Thanks. babe.
- Yeah.

166
00:14:13.754 --> 00:14:17.491
I'm really sorry
about Miranda. babe.

167
00:14:17.524 --> 00:14:18.759
Yeah.

168
00:14:18.792 --> 00:14:21.695
Ahh.

169
00:14:21.728 --> 00:14:24.598
Please don't stop.
That feels amazing.

170
00:14:24.631 --> 00:14:26.299
Well. you know.
it'd feel a lot better

171
00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.468
if you came and got in bed.
It's pretty late.

172
00:14:28.502 --> 00:14:30.872
I know. I have... I have court
in the morning.

173
00:14:30.905 --> 00:14:33.273
I've got to get
this done tonight.

174
00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:37.511
Ah. that's crazy.
You work more than I do.

175
00:14:37.544 --> 00:14:40.313
Yeah. well. at least my job
keeps me in town.

176
00:14:43.017 --> 00:14:47.320
Alright. you got me on that one.

177
00:14:47.354 --> 00:14:51.224
Don't stay up too late. alright?

178
00:14:51.258 --> 00:14:55.629
- Okay.
- Alright.

179
00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:57.932
- I love you.
- Love you too.

180
00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:06.573
This man. Eric Johnson.

181
00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:10.945
violently took the life
of Jason Simone.

182
00:15:10.978 --> 00:15:16.316
Jason was a father.
he was a brother.

183
00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:21.488
He was also someone's son.

184
00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:24.324
Do any of you have children?

185
00:15:24.357 --> 00:15:26.259
What if someone
took away the right

186
00:15:26.293 --> 00:15:29.362
for you to hold
your child again?

187
00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:32.766
To tell them
that you love them.

188
00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:34.869
Now. think about
Jason's children.

189
00:15:34.902 --> 00:15:37.972
They now will have to
grow up without a father

190
00:15:38.005 --> 00:15:41.441
because Eric Johnson
took that from them.

191
00:15:43.443 --> 00:15:46.881
This man has no regard.

192
00:15:46.914 --> 00:15:50.484
no thought.

193
00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:53.553
no forgiveness in his heart.

194
00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:56.356
Now. he may not have had
a perfect childhood.

195
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:58.625
but who does?

196
00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:02.596
We all go through things in life
that we wish we could fix.

197
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:05.298
but that's life.

198
00:16:05.332 --> 00:16:08.401
And it does not give one
the right to take it away

199
00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:10.004
because you're not
happy with it.

200
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.343
Thank you very much.

201
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.883
This is $5.000 a bottle.

202
00:16:21.916 --> 00:16:25.385
You did this? Wow.

203
00:16:25.418 --> 00:16:26.753
I'm sure we can find
something sexier.

204
00:16:26.787 --> 00:16:28.022
Alright. this is on me.

205
00:16:28.055 --> 00:16:29.790
You did... is this you?

206
00:16:29.824 --> 00:16:31.391
- This is the really good stuff.
- You did this?

207
00:16:31.424 --> 00:16:33.727
This is the really good stuff.
Yeah. I did this.

208
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.562
Thank you.

209
00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:38.532
By the way. you guys. I'm glad
we were finally able to do this.

210
00:16:38.565 --> 00:16:40.101
Cindy. it's nice
to finally meet you.

211
00:16:40.134 --> 00:16:42.036
And it is so good
to meet you. Nicole.

212
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:44.806
Roger is always
bragging about you.

213
00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:47.574
I've heard nothing but the best
things about you as well.

214
00:16:47.607 --> 00:16:49.010
Oh. I doubt it.

215
00:16:49.043 --> 00:16:51.813
Roger doesn't say nice things
unless I pay him.

216
00:16:51.846 --> 00:16:53.981
Oh. come on. That's why
she's my best attorney.

217
00:16:54.015 --> 00:16:56.884
Knows exactly what to say
and when to say it.

218
00:16:56.918 --> 00:16:58.485
And. Brian. I've been
meaning to tell you.

219
00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:00.720
ever since you married her.

220
00:17:00.754 --> 00:17:03.124
she's been 10-0 in the
courthouse... never loses.

221
00:17:03.157 --> 00:17:04.724
- Wow.
- Never.

222
00:17:04.758 --> 00:17:05.927
You got it all wrong
though. man.

223
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.661
it's her that makes me better.

224
00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.729
Babe. you know you make me...
you make me better. babe.

225
00:17:09.763 --> 00:17:11.364
- Babe. aw.
- Aw. look at it.

226
00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:13.600
Look at it. Look at it.

227
00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:17.604
- How did you guys meet?
- Well. we met on a dating app.

228
00:17:17.637 --> 00:17:20.440
- Dating... yeah.
- Really? What's that?

229
00:17:20.473 --> 00:17:22.642
I don't know what that is.
Sounds cool.

230
00:17:22.676 --> 00:17:24.145
- We didn't need that. dear.
- No. we didn't need that.

231
00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:27.380
But... But. you know. we still
instantly connected.

232
00:17:27.414 --> 00:17:30.584
and I remember when you first
walked into the coffee shop.

233
00:17:30.617 --> 00:17:33.453
- Yes.
- And I looked into your eyes.

234
00:17:33.486 --> 00:17:35.022
and I just knew.

235
00:17:35.056 --> 00:17:38.692
It was as if I'd known you
my whole life.

236
00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:41.162
Yeah. I mean. four months later.
we were married.

237
00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:43.865
and it's been nothing
but happiness ever since.

238
00:17:43.898 --> 00:17:46.934
Okay. a toast to success.

239
00:17:46.968 --> 00:17:48.401
- Yes.
- Success.

240
00:17:48.435 --> 00:17:50.770
- And happy marriage.
- Happy marriage.

241
00:17:50.805 --> 00:17:53.740
Yes. Let's keep those
wins rolling in.

242
00:17:53.773 --> 00:17:56.643
- Yes. please.
- Nice work.

243
00:17:56.676 --> 00:17:59.546
- Upsadaisy. here you go.
- Whoo. oh. my gosh.

244
00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:00.747
My wife is fine. She'll be okay.

245
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.816
Should not have had
that last glass.

246
00:18:01.849 --> 00:18:03.516
Thank you. sir.

247
00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.618
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

248
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:06.053
Safety. hoo!

249
00:18:08.722 --> 00:18:10.457
Now get. wait. wait.
wait. you go first.

250
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.692
Oh. my. gosh.
help me up these stairs. please.

251
00:18:12.726 --> 00:18:16.163
Oh. man.

252
00:18:16.197 --> 00:18:17.832
Is the door open?

253
00:18:17.865 --> 00:18:19.934
Hold on.

254
00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:29.476
Oh. my God.

255
00:18:29.509 --> 00:18:30.610
Call 911. babe.

256
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.086
Jesus Christ.

257
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.156
Hi. Yes. um. I'd like to report
a break-in. please.

258
00:18:54.534 --> 00:18:56.037
Looks good.

259
00:18:57.071 --> 00:18:58.172
Thank you.

260
00:18:58.205 --> 00:19:00.440
We'll square right here.

261
00:19:02.176 --> 00:19:03.244
This is for you.

262
00:19:03.277 --> 00:19:07.882
- Thank you.
- Great job.

263
00:19:07.915 --> 00:19:09.083
What do we have here?

264
00:19:09.116 --> 00:19:11.584
What is this?

265
00:19:11.618 --> 00:19:13.486
- Mm-hmm?
- Okay. look. arm.

266
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.555
- Arm. disarm.
- Disarm.

267
00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:21.728
One. two.

268
00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:23.530
One. two. three. two.

269
00:19:23.563 --> 00:19:24.564
Good. One.

270
00:19:24.597 --> 00:19:26.834
Two. three. two.

271
00:19:26.867 --> 00:19:27.935
Two. three. two.

272
00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:29.870
Two. three. two.

273
00:19:29.904 --> 00:19:31.105
- Hey. I'll be right with you.
- Hey. okay.

274
00:19:31.138 --> 00:19:33.573
One. two. One. two. Good.

275
00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:35.142
Cesar. do me a favor
and take over.

276
00:19:39.046 --> 00:19:40.047
- Hey.
- Hey.

277
00:19:40.081 --> 00:19:41.614
- Nicole. right?
- Yes.

278
00:19:41.648 --> 00:19:43.050
Great. How you doing?
Glad you showed up.

279
00:19:43.084 --> 00:19:45.920
- Let's go get some boxing in.
- Alright. yeah.

280
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.664
Hey. I heard what
happened the other night.

281
00:19:57.697 --> 00:19:58.732
Are you guys okay?

282
00:19:58.765 --> 00:20:00.667
Yeah. Well. nothing was stolen.

283
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.669
Brian had
a security system installed.

284
00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.071
so I think we'll be fine.

285
00:20:04.105 --> 00:20:05.940
Oh. my God. that is so scary.
I can't imagine.

286
00:20:05.973 --> 00:20:08.641
You know. my neighbor's car
got broken into the other day.

287
00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:10.177
Yes. People are crazy.

288
00:20:10.211 --> 00:20:13.014
Yeah. well. that's why
I started taking kickboxing.

289
00:20:13.047 --> 00:20:15.049
- I don't blame you.
- Yeah. I started yesterday.

290
00:20:15.082 --> 00:20:18.618
I mean. I gotta be able
to protect myself.

291
00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:20.121
And Brian.

292
00:20:20.154 --> 00:20:21.654
Shoot. I might need
to take some with you.

293
00:20:21.688 --> 00:20:23.656
Yeah. come.
It can't hurt. right?

294
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.558
- No. I need to.
- Alright.

295
00:20:25.592 --> 00:20:26.861
so. what have you
got for me today. Tam?

296
00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:28.896
Okay. so Westfield
just filed a motion

297
00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:30.597
and the judge
granted that today.

298
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.599
Harris is getting really.
really close on cracking in

299
00:20:32.632 --> 00:20:34.101
on that Johnson case.

300
00:20:34.135 --> 00:20:36.636
And Chris Simms called you twice
about the Kester case.

301
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:39.639
- Call him back.
- Mrs. Taylor. Roger called.

302
00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:42.143
He needs you to cover
for him today.

303
00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:44.178
Well. he's got that mediation
at 8:00.

304
00:20:44.211 --> 00:20:45.913
That's in 30 minutes.

305
00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:48.715
You know. Roger really
gets on my nerves.

306
00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.051
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

307
00:20:50.084 --> 00:20:51.952
- Thanks. Tam.
- You're welcome.

308
00:21:13.874 --> 00:21:15.009
Hey.

309
00:21:15.042 --> 00:21:16.310
Hey. baby.
You want some breakfast?

310
00:21:16.343 --> 00:21:18.946
Hey. No. I'm good.
Why are you dressed?

311
00:21:18.979 --> 00:21:20.747
I have an emergency
meeting in Phoenix.

312
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.782
- About this new project.
- What?

313
00:21:22.817 --> 00:21:24.919
Actually. Jesus.
I got to run.

314
00:21:24.952 --> 00:21:26.854
My flight's in like two hours.
I got to get to the airport.

315
00:21:26.887 --> 00:21:28.923
H-Hold on.
When did this happen?

316
00:21:28.956 --> 00:21:30.124
I just found out last night.

317
00:21:30.157 --> 00:21:32.393
You told me
you were off last night.

318
00:21:32.426 --> 00:21:34.295
Okay. well. are you forgetting
about your mother's barbecue

319
00:21:34.328 --> 00:21:36.130
that we're supposed
to go to this weekend?

320
00:21:36.163 --> 00:21:37.630
- You can still go.
- What?

321
00:21:37.664 --> 00:21:39.166
- Yeah.
- No.

322
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.700
I'm not going near that woman.
Your mother hates me.

323
00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:41.969
She doesn't hate... Stop.

324
00:21:42.002 --> 00:21:43.304
She doesn't hate you.
She loves you.

325
00:21:43.337 --> 00:21:44.839
Once I move up in the company.

326
00:21:44.872 --> 00:21:46.874
I'll be in more control
of my schedule.

327
00:21:46.907 --> 00:21:49.276
But for now.
I'm on their clock. okay?

328
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.881
Hey. I mean. I could quit
if you want me to.

329
00:21:53.914 --> 00:21:57.151
- I could do that.
- No. it's just that. you know.

330
00:21:57.184 --> 00:21:58.886
I wish you wouldn't
leave me here by myself

331
00:21:58.919 --> 00:22:00.620
after what happened.

332
00:22:03.124 --> 00:22:07.261
I promise I will
make it up to you.

333
00:22:07.294 --> 00:22:09.130
just as soon as I get home.

334
00:22:09.163 --> 00:22:10.931
Hmm?

335
00:22:10.965 --> 00:22:13.000
- You'd better.
- Oh. I better?

336
00:22:13.033 --> 00:22:14.902
- Yeah. you better.
- Oh. come on now. babe.

337
00:22:14.935 --> 00:22:16.337
You know I just put it on
last night

338
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.673
with the candles and bubble bath
and all that. hmm?

339
00:22:20.707 --> 00:22:23.177
Hmm? You know your boy know
what you're doing.

340
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:27.348
- Go catch your flight.
- Okay.

341
00:22:27.381 --> 00:22:28.983
Be good.

342
00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:30.317
That's good food in there.
Eat that.

343
00:22:30.351 --> 00:22:32.253
Oh. wait.

344
00:22:32.286 --> 00:22:34.989
- Oh.
- Forgot something.

345
00:22:35.022 --> 00:22:36.290
Love you.

346
00:22:36.323 --> 00:22:38.392
- Love you.
- Love you too.

347
00:22:38.425 --> 00:22:39.894
Be good. be good. be good.

348
00:22:45.765 --> 00:22:49.136
Don't bring the afro.
Wait. wait a minute.

349
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.871
- What?
- Why last night.

350
00:22:50.905 --> 00:22:52.273
me and Dante. we was
getting it in. right?

351
00:22:52.306 --> 00:22:53.807
- Uh-huh.
- And when we were done.

352
00:22:53.841 --> 00:22:55.943
he asked what I thought
about marriage.

353
00:22:55.976 --> 00:22:57.945
- Oh. my God.
- I think he's about to ask.

354
00:22:57.978 --> 00:23:00.347
You'd better say yes
and not run him off.

355
00:23:00.381 --> 00:23:02.082
I'm going to say it. I'm not.
I don't run people off.

356
00:23:02.116 --> 00:23:03.817
You'd better not mess this up.

357
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:07.720
Shut up.
I love him.

358
00:23:07.754 --> 00:23:09.490
Okay. something's wrong with you

359
00:23:09.523 --> 00:23:11.192
'cause you've been sitting here
moping and stuff.

360
00:23:11.225 --> 00:23:12.493
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.

361
00:23:12.526 --> 00:23:13.793
I'm sorry. you guys. I'm sorry.

362
00:23:13.827 --> 00:23:15.930
I'm... I'm just thinking.

363
00:23:15.963 --> 00:23:19.466
Well. stop thinking.
You're messing up the vibe.

364
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:21.835
Okay. seriously. I want
to ask you guys something.

365
00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:25.306
- Oh. Lord. What?
- Okay.

366
00:23:25.339 --> 00:23:26.974
Do you think that Brian
would cheat on me?

367
00:23:27.007 --> 00:23:30.377
- What?
- Girl. Brian all weird-ass. No.

368
00:23:30.411 --> 00:23:32.179
No. I don't think so.

369
00:23:32.213 --> 00:23:34.448
- What would make you ask that?
- I don't know.

370
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:38.118
He's just... He's just out of
town on business a lot.

371
00:23:38.152 --> 00:23:40.120
- It's called work. Nicole.
- No.

372
00:23:40.154 --> 00:23:41.922
No. every year
on our anniversary

373
00:23:41.956 --> 00:23:43.891
he always acts a little strange.

374
00:23:43.924 --> 00:23:48.362
But I don't know.
this year something's different.

375
00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:50.064
- Mm.
- Mm.

376
00:23:50.097 --> 00:23:53.000
Did you check his phone?
Look at his e-mails. nothing?

377
00:23:53.033 --> 00:23:56.170
- Did you check his car?
- His car?

378
00:23:56.203 --> 00:23:58.005
Because you never
drive his car.

379
00:23:58.038 --> 00:23:59.772
You always drive your car
when y'all go out.

380
00:23:59.807 --> 00:24:01.842
so maybe he won't think
you'd search in there.

381
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:04.378
Mm-mm.
Knowing. mm. come on.

382
00:24:04.411 --> 00:24:05.546
Something is in his car.
Let's check.

383
00:24:05.579 --> 00:24:07.881
What?

384
00:24:07.915 --> 00:24:09.883
Locked.

385
00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:11.952
You don't have a spare key?

386
00:24:11.986 --> 00:24:13.520
No. he usually
takes it with him.

387
00:24:13.554 --> 00:24:14.955
Oh.

388
00:24:14.989 --> 00:24:17.558
Well. Brian is your husband.
right?

389
00:24:17.591 --> 00:24:20.261
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Call roadside assistance.

390
00:24:20.294 --> 00:24:24.164
They going to let you in
through the satellite.

391
00:24:24.198 --> 00:24:25.532
- You're shady.
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:24:25.566 --> 00:24:27.034
Alright.

393
00:24:27.067 --> 00:24:28.936
Can't believe I'm doing this.

394
00:24:35.175 --> 00:24:37.911
Roadside Assistance.
How may I help you?

395
00:24:37.945 --> 00:24:43.017
Hi. yes. we are locked
out of our car.

396
00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.052
Sure. Can I have
your name. please?

397
00:24:45.085 --> 00:24:47.921
Yes. Brian and Nicole Taylor.

398
00:24:47.955 --> 00:24:50.424
And can I have
the access code?

399
00:24:50.457 --> 00:24:54.161
The code? It's 1212.

400
00:24:54.194 --> 00:24:55.996
Stand by.

401
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.598
Boom.

402
00:24:57.631 --> 00:24:59.400
Exactly. Exactly.

403
00:24:59.433 --> 00:25:01.535
Yeah. it just worked.
Thank you very much.

404
00:25:01.568 --> 00:25:03.137
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

405
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.371
Thank me later.

406
00:25:04.405 --> 00:25:06.307
Okay. clearly you've
done that before.

407
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.543
Well. girl. growing up in the
hood. you learn a thing or two.

408
00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:16.083
Okay. Alright. Let's see.

409
00:25:16.116 --> 00:25:17.851
Everything.

410
00:25:26.393 --> 00:25:28.262
Call Paige?

411
00:25:28.295 --> 00:25:29.630
Mm.

412
00:25:29.663 --> 00:25:32.366
Paige.
That's a white girl name. too.

413
00:25:32.399 --> 00:25:33.967
Well. they get on my nerve.

414
00:25:34.001 --> 00:25:37.037
Tammy. Stop.
You are jumping to conclusions.

415
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:39.440
This doesn't... We don't even
know if this means anything.

416
00:25:39.473 --> 00:25:42.910
- It's just a note.
- Girl. Try your name.

417
00:25:42.943 --> 00:25:44.011
Okay.

418
00:25:47.047 --> 00:25:51.919
Oh. okay.

419
00:25:51.952 --> 00:25:53.354
- What is it? What?
- Bow.

420
00:25:53.387 --> 00:25:55.155
Our names plus
the date of our marriage.

421
00:25:55.189 --> 00:25:57.991
Oh.

422
00:25:58.025 --> 00:26:01.462
Okay. Paige.

423
00:26:01.495 --> 00:26:03.430
No results found.

424
00:26:03.464 --> 00:26:05.999
Okay. Okay. this is good.

425
00:26:06.033 --> 00:26:07.935
This is good.
You should feel good.

426
00:26:07.968 --> 00:26:09.536
Right? You should feel good.
She should feel good.

427
00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.205
- Yeah.
- You know what?

428
00:26:11.238 --> 00:26:13.574
I'm sorry. you guys.
I'm being totally paranoid.

429
00:26:13.607 --> 00:26:15.442
- You're right.
- That's okay.

430
00:26:15.476 --> 00:26:18.312
Look. that's what we here for.
to be paranoid with you.

431
00:26:18.345 --> 00:26:21.348
Oh. and I wouldn't tell Brian
anything. not in the least

432
00:26:21.382 --> 00:26:23.550
until you have solid evidence
to prove your case.

433
00:26:23.584 --> 00:26:25.018
- Alright?
- Let's go get us a drink.

434
00:26:25.052 --> 00:26:27.121
'cause you need one
and I need one.

435
00:26:27.154 --> 00:26:28.689
We just all in the man's office.

436
00:26:28.722 --> 00:26:30.424
Girl.

437
00:26:30.457 --> 00:26:32.993
- Got my blood pressure all up.
- Man. he just at work.

438
00:26:44.605 --> 00:26:47.574
Oh. well. if it isn't
my son's beautiful wife.

439
00:26:47.608 --> 00:26:50.577
Come on.
Let me fix you some tea.

440
00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:54.281
So. how are you
and my baby doing?

441
00:26:54.314 --> 00:26:58.485
Honestly.
been a little bit concerned

442
00:26:58.519 --> 00:27:02.289
about all these business trips
he's been leaving on.

443
00:27:04.491 --> 00:27:08.195
My Brian is a busy man.
you know that.

444
00:27:08.228 --> 00:27:10.497
That's what you
signed up for.

445
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:13.100
And you yourself
as a big-shot attorney.

446
00:27:13.133 --> 00:27:15.035
you're busy too.

447
00:27:15.068 --> 00:27:18.105
Yes. I know. It's just...

448
00:27:18.138 --> 00:27:20.073
I guess I've been wondering

449
00:27:20.107 --> 00:27:25.979
if Brian would ever do anything
to hurt the relationship.

450
00:27:26.013 --> 00:27:28.482
Like?

451
00:27:28.515 --> 00:27:30.484
Have an affair?

452
00:27:30.517 --> 00:27:34.621
No. I highly doubt
that he would be cheating.

453
00:27:34.655 --> 00:27:37.591
An affair. no.

454
00:27:37.624 --> 00:27:40.694
I want to believe that.
Mrs. Taylor.

455
00:27:40.727 --> 00:27:44.097
It's just that. right now.
I mean.

456
00:27:44.131 --> 00:27:48.302
sometimes he's present.
sometimes he's not.

457
00:27:48.335 --> 00:27:52.673
I just... I just don't know
what to do.

458
00:27:57.678 --> 00:28:00.247
A hippo?

459
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.117
Extremely unpredictable.

460
00:28:04.151 --> 00:28:08.789
Making him the most
dangerous mammal in Africa.

461
00:28:08.823 --> 00:28:11.758
- I did not know that.
- Hmm.

462
00:28:11.792 --> 00:28:17.698
Men can be dangerously
unpredictable. but not my Brian.

463
00:28:17.731 --> 00:28:20.133
You'd think after
four years of marriage.

464
00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:23.437
I'd be able to
predict him by now.

465
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:28.141
Well. why don't you
try talking to him?

466
00:28:28.175 --> 00:28:30.611
You'd be amazed
at how communication

467
00:28:30.644 --> 00:28:32.479
works in a marriage.

468
00:28:32.513 --> 00:28:35.082
I would have have
never been able to be

469
00:28:35.115 --> 00:28:40.989
with my Patrick for 30 years
without communication.

470
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:47.661
God rest his soul.

471
00:28:47.694 --> 00:28:51.298
Thank you.
I needed to hear that.

472
00:28:51.331 --> 00:28:52.533
Come on. dear.

473
00:28:52.566 --> 00:28:55.102
I'm going to get you
some barbecue.

474
00:28:55.135 --> 00:28:58.806
I'm so glad you came early
so we'd have a chance to chat

475
00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.609
and talk before
my loud friends got here.

476
00:29:02.643 --> 00:29:05.078
If you want some flip-flops.
I got some for you.

477
00:29:05.112 --> 00:29:06.146
Thank you.

478
00:29:11.218 --> 00:29:15.656
Alright. babe.
Got to run. got to run.

479
00:29:15.689 --> 00:29:16.858
- Love you.
- Love you too.

480
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:19.359
Alright.

481
00:29:41.214 --> 00:29:42.716
Let's go. One. two.

482
00:29:42.749 --> 00:29:44.418
One. two. Good.

483
00:29:44.451 --> 00:29:45.419
Nice. Again.

484
00:29:45.452 --> 00:29:47.354
Good. One. two. one. two.

485
00:29:47.387 --> 00:29:48.689
Good. High kick.

486
00:29:48.722 --> 00:29:50.524
Again. again.

487
00:29:52.159 --> 00:29:53.460
Guilty!

488
00:30:26.627 --> 00:30:28.161
- Okay.
- Thank you.

489
00:30:28.195 --> 00:30:29.529
- You're welcome.
- Love you. babe.

490
00:30:29.563 --> 00:30:31.798
- Love you too. Bye.
- See you soon.

491
00:30:55.689 --> 00:31:00.260
Hi. yes. I'm just trying to
access some of my phone records.

492
00:31:00.293 --> 00:31:02.596
and I seem to have
forgotten my password.

493
00:31:38.866 --> 00:31:40.634
Cute. Okay. let's put
that one on the left side.

494
00:31:40.667 --> 00:31:42.870
Let's put that over there
in the front.

495
00:31:42.904 --> 00:31:46.339
- Brandi. hey.
- Nicole Taylor.

496
00:31:46.373 --> 00:31:48.542
What a pleasant surprise.

497
00:31:48.575 --> 00:31:50.878
- What are you doing here?
- Oh. I was in the area.

498
00:31:50.912 --> 00:31:53.380
thought I'd come and check
out the boutique.

499
00:31:53.413 --> 00:31:55.649
- Let me show you around.
- Sure.

500
00:32:10.064 --> 00:32:12.799
So what made you want
to open a boutique here

501
00:32:12.834 --> 00:32:14.401
instead of overseas?

502
00:32:14.434 --> 00:32:15.870
I mean. I know
you were modeling over there.

503
00:32:15.903 --> 00:32:18.806
I was keeping up
with you. girl.

504
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:26.013
Honestly. I got so wrapped up
in that life that I almost died.

505
00:32:26.047 --> 00:32:29.549
Partying too much. not eating.
trying to stay skinny.

506
00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:33.921
It just was a lot on me.

507
00:32:33.955 --> 00:32:36.490
So I moved back.

508
00:32:36.523 --> 00:32:40.527
I wanted to feel something
familiar again. you know?

509
00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.596
Been sober for five years now.

510
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:44.464
- Really?
- Yeah.

511
00:32:44.498 --> 00:32:46.533
- Well. good for you.
- Thanks.

512
00:32:46.566 --> 00:32:48.002
But enough about me.
What about you?

513
00:32:48.035 --> 00:32:50.437
- How's Brian?
- Amazing.

514
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.807
Coming up on our
four-year anniversary.

515
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.641
even though it seems
like only yesterday

516
00:32:54.674 --> 00:32:56.676
he swept me off my feet. so...

517
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.546
I'm so happy for you. Nicole.

518
00:32:59.579 --> 00:33:01.949
I know how much
you've always wanted that.

519
00:33:01.983 --> 00:33:05.352
ever since we were kids.

520
00:33:05.385 --> 00:33:06.686
Yeah. thanks.

521
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:11.558
You know.
I never got to say sorry

522
00:33:11.591 --> 00:33:14.728
for what happened
at summer camp.

523
00:33:14.761 --> 00:33:19.033
Oh. I mean. come on. Brandi.
We were young and stupid.

524
00:33:19.066 --> 00:33:21.903
You guys may have been.
I wasn't.

525
00:33:24.704 --> 00:33:27.875
- That was in the past.
- I know.

526
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:31.112
But it affected all of us
that summer.

527
00:33:31.145 --> 00:33:33.480
Camp is boring.
Camp sucks.

528
00:33:33.513 --> 00:33:35.615
No. it doesn't.

529
00:33:35.649 --> 00:33:37.717
- What's up. Devon?
- What's up. bro?

530
00:33:37.751 --> 00:33:39.452
Hello. Nicole.

531
00:33:39.486 --> 00:33:42.123
Hi.

532
00:33:42.156 --> 00:33:44.658
Oh. what's up. Piggy Pete?

533
00:33:44.691 --> 00:33:46.693
Oh. come on. Devon. do you need
to keep making fun of me?

534
00:33:46.726 --> 00:33:49.663
Do you have to bother him?
He's not bothering you.

535
00:33:49.696 --> 00:33:52.365
Nah. just him being here's
bothering me.

536
00:33:52.399 --> 00:33:54.936
Forget you.

537
00:33:54.969 --> 00:33:57.071
Come on. guys. leave him alone!

538
00:33:57.104 --> 00:34:00.007
- You don't have to do that!
- Nicole. stop.

539
00:34:00.041 --> 00:34:02.944
Stop being such a Debbie Downer.
They're only kidding.

540
00:34:07.982 --> 00:34:10.584
Going to go cry
to your mom now. Piggy Peter?

541
00:34:10.617 --> 00:34:13.020
Yeah. Piggy Pete.
go cry to your mom.

542
00:34:13.054 --> 00:34:15.156
Come on. guys. Let's go.

543
00:34:15.189 --> 00:34:17.390
- Let's go. Nicole.
- See you later. pig.

544
00:34:20.928 --> 00:34:24.464
I never meant
for any of that to happen.

545
00:34:24.497 --> 00:34:25.867
Part of me was just being a kid

546
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.837
but the other part knew
I was taking it too far.

547
00:34:29.871 --> 00:34:31.973
Peter was a good kid.

548
00:34:32.006 --> 00:34:34.641
He didn't deserve that.

549
00:34:34.674 --> 00:34:37.812
I mean. we killed him. Nicole.

550
00:34:37.845 --> 00:34:40.547
Look. we've all done things
that we're not proud of.

551
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.117
that we wish we could take back.

552
00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:46.053
But what's done is done.

553
00:34:46.087 --> 00:34:49.924
The important thing now
is what we do as adults.

554
00:34:49.957 --> 00:34:52.026
You're right.

555
00:34:52.059 --> 00:34:55.528
You know what? I should go.

556
00:34:55.562 --> 00:34:58.598
Hey. it was really nice
seeing you. Nicole.

557
00:34:58.632 --> 00:35:00.935
You too. Brandi.

558
00:35:00.968 --> 00:35:06.539
Hey. let's not let any time pass
before we do this again. okay?

559
00:35:06.573 --> 00:35:09.676
Life is too short.

560
00:35:09.709 --> 00:35:10.912
Couldn't agree more.

561
00:35:50.717 --> 00:35:52.485
Looks like she OD'd on heroin.

562
00:35:52.519 --> 00:35:54.721
- Really?
- Girl said she left at 8:45.

563
00:35:54.754 --> 00:35:57.624
came back a few minutes later.
and found her dead.

564
00:35:57.657 --> 00:35:59.193
Shit.

565
00:36:08.235 --> 00:36:11.638
Hi. I'm Detective Tucker.
What's your name?

566
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:13.040
Jessica.

567
00:36:13.074 --> 00:36:14.809
It's nice to meet you. Jessica.

568
00:36:14.842 --> 00:36:18.813
So... So I understand you left
around 8:00 or so?

569
00:36:18.846 --> 00:36:20.881
I left at 8:45.

570
00:36:20.915 --> 00:36:24.251
Came back 5 or 10 minutes
later to grab my phone.

571
00:36:24.285 --> 00:36:25.987
That's when I found her.

572
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.888
Did you ever see
Miss Smith using drugs?

573
00:36:27.922 --> 00:36:29.556
No. sir.

574
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:31.158
Did you ever see her
looking distracted.

575
00:36:31.192 --> 00:36:33.227
strange behavior at the job.
or anything to make you feel

576
00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.695
like maybe she had
a drug problem?

577
00:36:35.729 --> 00:36:37.064
Never.

578
00:36:37.098 --> 00:36:39.900
If anything. she was
completely against drugs.

579
00:36:39.934 --> 00:36:43.871
This is shocking. honestly.

580
00:36:43.904 --> 00:36:45.873
Alright.

581
00:36:45.906 --> 00:36:47.507
Thank you. Jessica.

582
00:36:56.851 --> 00:36:58.785
This is
a very. very serious matter.

583
00:36:58.819 --> 00:37:00.620
as I'm sure you know.

584
00:37:00.653 --> 00:37:02.189
I talked to a young lady
that worked with her.

585
00:37:02.223 --> 00:37:04.657
and she said that you were
the last one to talk to her

586
00:37:04.691 --> 00:37:06.193
or see her before she died.

587
00:37:06.227 --> 00:37:08.162
Yes. I-I did stop by her store.

588
00:37:08.195 --> 00:37:10.931
- So you knew Brandi?
- Yes. we grew up together.

589
00:37:10.965 --> 00:37:13.067
And you knew
Miranda Smith too. right?

590
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.669
Miranda. Brandi.
our other friend Sommer.

591
00:37:16.703 --> 00:37:19.340
- We were inseparable as kids.
- How close were you?

592
00:37:19.373 --> 00:37:21.142
Okay. why is any of this
necessary. Detective?

593
00:37:21.175 --> 00:37:23.344
- I'm just doing my job.
- Babe. it's okay.

594
00:37:23.377 --> 00:37:25.946
- Babe.
- It's okay.

595
00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:29.950
How close were you all?

596
00:37:29.984 --> 00:37:33.821
Well. we went to elementary
school together. summer camp.

597
00:37:33.854 --> 00:37:36.057
We were close as kids.
but honestly

598
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.226
we hadn't really seen each other
for a few years until recently.

599
00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.794
Got it.

600
00:37:40.828 --> 00:37:42.163
So she never mentioned to you

601
00:37:42.196 --> 00:37:43.864
anything that would
make you feel like

602
00:37:43.898 --> 00:37:45.066
she was going to relapse?

603
00:37:45.099 --> 00:37:47.734
No. Nothing at all.

604
00:37:47.767 --> 00:37:49.236
She seemed very in control
of her life.

605
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:52.073
She told me she'd been clean
for five years.

606
00:37:52.106 --> 00:37:54.075
Never alluded to
anything made you feel like

607
00:37:54.108 --> 00:37:57.610
- she was crying out for help?
- No.

608
00:37:57.644 --> 00:38:01.714
Honestly. this whole thing comes
as a complete shock to me.

609
00:38:01.748 --> 00:38:04.385
Well. thank you.
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor. thank you.

610
00:38:04.418 --> 00:38:07.888
And I'm genuinely sorry
for your loss.

611
00:38:07.922 --> 00:38:09.656
I will show you out.

612
00:38:22.103 --> 00:38:24.038
Say you wanted
to commit suicide. right.

613
00:38:24.071 --> 00:38:25.840
so you jumped off the roof.

614
00:38:25.873 --> 00:38:29.110
Do you think you would have
enough time to change your mind.

615
00:38:29.143 --> 00:38:31.979
turn around. and grab something?

616
00:38:32.012 --> 00:38:34.348
Mm. probably not. Why?

617
00:38:34.381 --> 00:38:39.386
Because this autopsy report
says that she had bruising

618
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.355
and scratching inside her hand

619
00:38:41.388 --> 00:38:43.390
as if she was trying
to grab something.

620
00:38:43.424 --> 00:38:46.026
Hmm. So what does that mean?

621
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.395
That means that she was
hanging onto something

622
00:38:48.429 --> 00:38:50.064
before she fell.

623
00:38:50.097 --> 00:38:53.300
Mm. Maybe it was an accident.
Maybe she slipped.

624
00:38:53.334 --> 00:38:56.103
Or maybe she was pushed.
Maybe she was helped.

625
00:38:56.137 --> 00:38:58.339
And the Brandi girl.
find anything on her?

626
00:38:58.372 --> 00:39:01.809
Her report. I checked it out.
She was a model.

627
00:39:01.842 --> 00:39:05.246
She got arrested a few times...
DUI. possession.

628
00:39:05.279 --> 00:39:07.314
But part of her probation
was that she had to be admitted

629
00:39:07.348 --> 00:39:09.884
to a drug treatment program
five years ago.

630
00:39:09.917 --> 00:39:11.784
But get this.

631
00:39:11.819 --> 00:39:15.156
She was addicted
to cocaine and alcohol.

632
00:39:15.189 --> 00:39:17.458
She had never done heroin.

633
00:39:17.491 --> 00:39:20.793
Five years later. she ODs?

634
00:39:20.828 --> 00:39:23.230
I don't know. Detective.
Maybe it's beginner's luck.

635
00:39:23.264 --> 00:39:26.200
You're not funny. man.
This is serious.

636
00:39:26.233 --> 00:39:29.970
Alright. Talk to me.

637
00:39:30.004 --> 00:39:32.473
Both of the girls went to school
together. they grew up together.

638
00:39:32.506 --> 00:39:35.409
Two girls go to school together.
they both commit suicide.

639
00:39:35.442 --> 00:39:38.145
I know. it's a strange
circumstance. It happens.

640
00:39:38.179 --> 00:39:41.714
I'm not buying that. I'm not.

641
00:39:41.748 --> 00:39:43.750
My gut tells me
something ain't right.

642
00:39:43.783 --> 00:39:45.953
Detective Patterson.
we need you.

643
00:39:45.986 --> 00:39:47.720
Yeah? Alright. one second.

644
00:39:52.393 --> 00:39:55.129
You might be onto
something here. Detective.

645
00:39:55.162 --> 00:39:56.497
Let me know.

646
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.432
Alright. what's up?

647
00:39:58.465 --> 00:40:00.267
We got a multiple
homicide situation.

648
00:40:11.845 --> 00:40:14.747
I'm sorry to call you
down here on such short notice.

649
00:40:14.781 --> 00:40:17.151
Note that this is being
recorded for the record.

650
00:40:20.321 --> 00:40:23.090
Tell me again about
your conversation with Miranda

651
00:40:23.123 --> 00:40:24.325
before she died.

652
00:40:24.358 --> 00:40:27.094
She told me about
her new boyfriend.

653
00:40:27.127 --> 00:40:30.464
We talked about our lives.
I mean. not much.

654
00:40:30.497 --> 00:40:32.166
She didn't seem suicidal?

655
00:40:32.199 --> 00:40:34.801
No. no. Not at all.

656
00:40:34.835 --> 00:40:37.538
Quite the opposite. actually.
She seemed really happy.

657
00:40:37.571 --> 00:40:41.542
Both were your friends.
That's... That's devastating.

658
00:40:41.575 --> 00:40:45.412
I want to know w-what's
your thoughts on that?

659
00:40:45.446 --> 00:40:49.016
All I know is Miranda
was a great friend.

660
00:40:49.049 --> 00:40:51.252
She didn't deserve it.

661
00:40:51.285 --> 00:40:53.854
Brandi on the other hand. she...

662
00:40:53.887 --> 00:40:54.955
Oh. you had a problem
with Brandi?

663
00:40:54.989 --> 00:40:56.190
That's not what I said.

664
00:40:56.223 --> 00:40:57.558
Why would you say
"on the other hand"?

665
00:40:57.591 --> 00:40:59.460
One deserves it.
it seems like you're implying

666
00:40:59.493 --> 00:41:00.995
someone deserved to die.

667
00:41:01.028 --> 00:41:03.330
What I meant was that she wasn't

668
00:41:03.364 --> 00:41:07.134
the nicest person in the world
growing up. that is all.

669
00:41:07.167 --> 00:41:09.103
Where you from?
You from the hood?

670
00:41:09.136 --> 00:41:12.573
I was raised in Maryland. went
to college in South Carolina.

671
00:41:12.606 --> 00:41:14.074
Not so sure about
the other girls

672
00:41:14.108 --> 00:41:16.176
other than they were
my wife's friends.

673
00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.179
What was your relationship
like with Brandi?

674
00:41:19.213 --> 00:41:21.949
I've known her since childhood.

675
00:41:21.982 --> 00:41:25.452
Knew her since childhood.

676
00:41:25.486 --> 00:41:27.855
And then we lost contact
after high school.

677
00:41:27.888 --> 00:41:30.057
She got a modeling contract
and then left the country.

678
00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.359
I mean. I hadn't
seen her in years.

679
00:41:32.393 --> 00:41:35.929
Until you saw her
at... at the funeral.

680
00:41:35.963 --> 00:41:37.498
Correct.

681
00:41:37.531 --> 00:41:40.134
So where were you the night
that Miranda got murdered?

682
00:41:40.167 --> 00:41:42.903
I'm sorry. excuse me.

683
00:41:42.936 --> 00:41:45.339
Allegedly committed suicide?

684
00:41:45.372 --> 00:41:47.341
At home.

685
00:41:47.374 --> 00:41:49.209
Nicole called me
when she first heard it.

686
00:41:49.243 --> 00:41:51.478
She called you first.

687
00:41:51.512 --> 00:41:53.480
Yes. She called me first.

688
00:41:53.514 --> 00:41:57.017
You don't know anybody who would
want either of these women dead?

689
00:41:57.051 --> 00:41:58.385
No.

690
00:41:58.419 --> 00:42:00.254
Thank you. Mrs. Taylor.

691
00:42:00.287 --> 00:42:02.222
You're free to go.

692
00:42:02.256 --> 00:42:04.291
Not guilty.

693
00:42:30.384 --> 00:42:32.553
Nicole. have a seat.

694
00:42:34.588 --> 00:42:39.493
Look. the partners and I
feel it's best that

695
00:42:39.526 --> 00:42:42.429
while you're going through
this rough patch.

696
00:42:42.463 --> 00:42:44.365
you take some time off.

697
00:42:44.398 --> 00:42:47.468
Wait. Roger. are you firing me?

698
00:42:47.501 --> 00:42:50.137
Of course not.
You're my best attorney.

699
00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.173
Just lately you're not
mentally here.

700
00:42:53.207 --> 00:42:54.975
I mean. you... you missed
a couple of staff meetings.

701
00:42:55.008 --> 00:42:56.543
You've been late a few times.
It's not you.

702
00:42:56.577 --> 00:43:00.581
Yeah. look. I-I have been
dealing with a lot.

703
00:43:00.614 --> 00:43:04.251
- But I can fix it. I promise.
- Nicole.

704
00:43:04.284 --> 00:43:06.320
You lost your first case
in years today.

705
00:43:06.353 --> 00:43:08.922
Your head's not in the game. and
I cannot afford any mistakes.

706
00:43:08.956 --> 00:43:11.992
Roger. I started here
as a temp 10 years ago.

707
00:43:12.025 --> 00:43:13.060
I've given this company
everything.

708
00:43:13.093 --> 00:43:14.461
This... This place is my life.

709
00:43:14.495 --> 00:43:16.430
That's why we're
giving you a paid leave.

710
00:43:16.463 --> 00:43:18.432
Think of it as the vacation
you've been wanting to take.

711
00:43:18.465 --> 00:43:20.000
Roger. please.

712
00:43:20.033 --> 00:43:21.702
Till this whole thing
blows over. okay?

713
00:43:21.735 --> 00:43:23.437
Great.

714
00:43:30.344 --> 00:43:31.712
Been meaning
to clean out this closet

715
00:43:31.745 --> 00:43:33.147
ever since Brian and I moved in.

716
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:37.217
I've just been
so busy with work.

717
00:43:37.251 --> 00:43:40.187
- haven't had the time. you know?
- I've seen.

718
00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.055
Well. now you have
all the time in the world.

719
00:43:42.089 --> 00:43:44.658
It's not like you got to go back
to work today or tomorrow.

720
00:43:46.193 --> 00:43:48.529
Yeah.

721
00:43:52.099 --> 00:43:53.534
What's wrong. Nicole?

722
00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:58.539
I don't know.

723
00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.609
I don't know.

724
00:44:02.643 --> 00:44:09.316
You know. I just can't look
at Brian in the same way.

725
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:12.352
I don't want to believe
that he's cheating on me.

726
00:44:12.386 --> 00:44:14.221
Brian is a loner.

727
00:44:14.254 --> 00:44:17.257
I mean. technically.
you are all that he has.

728
00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:19.092
Look. if you really feel
like the man is cheating on you.

729
00:44:19.126 --> 00:44:20.360
we can call my cousin Jerell.

730
00:44:20.394 --> 00:44:22.296
he can come over here.
beat his ass.

731
00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:25.466
and we can just
get it handled. okay?

732
00:44:25.499 --> 00:44:29.369
- You are a hot mess.
- I know. and I got your back.

733
00:44:29.403 --> 00:44:32.606
- Oh. my God.
- What? Ahh.

734
00:44:32.639 --> 00:44:35.642
There is some serious
blackmail material in here.

735
00:44:35.676 --> 00:44:38.278
Mm-hmm.

736
00:44:38.312 --> 00:44:41.081
- Let's see.
- Let's see. let's see.

737
00:44:44.384 --> 00:44:47.488
Ha! Look at your hair.

738
00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:51.425
Unh-unh. Why did your mom
do you like that?

739
00:44:51.458 --> 00:44:53.427
Look. you know yours
is just as bad.

740
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.429
Oh. no. I burned
my yearbook picture.

741
00:44:55.462 --> 00:44:57.564
Middle school was
the worst years of my life.

742
00:44:57.598 --> 00:44:59.066
Ah. yeah. tell me about it.

743
00:44:59.099 --> 00:45:00.434
I couldn't wait to get
to high school.

744
00:45:00.467 --> 00:45:02.402
Okay. yeah. high school.
I was cute.

745
00:45:04.839 --> 00:45:10.143
Look at Miranda.
She was so cute.

746
00:45:10.177 --> 00:45:13.413
- I'm sorry. Nicole.
- Yeah.

747
00:45:15.616 --> 00:45:18.552
Well. and Brandi.
she looks the same.

748
00:45:18.585 --> 00:45:22.155
She's been beautiful
her whole life. damn.

749
00:45:22.189 --> 00:45:26.793
Oh. I see why y'all
looked up to her.

750
00:45:26.828 --> 00:45:28.495
Oh. wow.

751
00:45:28.529 --> 00:45:30.297
Piggy Pete.

752
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:32.666
- Hmm.
- Peter Wells.

753
00:45:32.699 --> 00:45:34.836
Now. that boy
was in love with me.

754
00:45:34.869 --> 00:45:36.637
Oh. I remember you
telling me about him.

755
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:40.173
the little fat boy that was
crazy about you at the camp.

756
00:45:40.207 --> 00:45:41.742
Yeah.

757
00:45:41.775 --> 00:45:44.478
Gosh. we were
awful to him as kids.

758
00:45:47.681 --> 00:45:50.617
Put him down. he can't swim!
He can't swim!

759
00:45:50.651 --> 00:45:53.587
- Put him in the water!
- He can't swim!

760
00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.489
- Nicole!
- He can't swim!

761
00:45:55.522 --> 00:45:57.224
He can't swim!

762
00:45:57.257 --> 00:45:59.793
Stop!

763
00:46:05.332 --> 00:46:07.267
What y'all in here
talking about?

764
00:46:07.301 --> 00:46:10.671
- What's up. Brian?
- What's up?

765
00:46:10.704 --> 00:46:13.373
We were just looking at my
old middle school yearbook.

766
00:46:13.407 --> 00:46:16.878
Oh. no.
Oh. my goodness. let me see.

767
00:46:16.911 --> 00:46:19.346
Let me see this.

768
00:46:19.379 --> 00:46:23.116
Ohh. babe. you were so cute.
Look at that.

769
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:25.652
And even more beautiful now.

770
00:46:25.686 --> 00:46:28.288
Whoa. wait. is that little fat
boy you said had a crush on you?

771
00:46:28.322 --> 00:46:31.458
Ah. yeah.
We were terrible to him.

772
00:46:31.491 --> 00:46:34.761
Called him Piggy Peter
because he was overweight.

773
00:46:34.795 --> 00:46:37.865
Young girls are so harsh.

774
00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:40.734
Well. he had his chance
and now you all mine.

775
00:46:40.767 --> 00:46:42.369
I'm off to work.

776
00:46:42.402 --> 00:46:45.505
You ladies be good. alright?

777
00:46:45.539 --> 00:46:47.174
Bye. babe.

778
00:46:47.207 --> 00:46:48.775
Hey.

779
00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:50.912
You be sure and take care of her
while I'm gone. alright?

780
00:46:50.945 --> 00:46:52.412
- I got you.
- Okay.

781
00:46:52.446 --> 00:46:53.647
- Okay.
- Okay.

782
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.850
Okay.

783
00:46:55.883 --> 00:46:59.186
- Do you think he heard us?
- I hope not.

784
00:47:04.625 --> 00:47:06.593
Okay. look. I've been
doing some research.

785
00:47:06.627 --> 00:47:08.261
and I found out
where the girl works.

786
00:47:08.295 --> 00:47:10.530
- Stop.
- That old bar.

787
00:47:10.564 --> 00:47:12.399
Girl. we need to go
up there and regulate.

788
00:47:12.432 --> 00:47:16.503
- I got my bat in the car.
- Relax. Stop being dramatic.

789
00:47:16.536 --> 00:47:18.538
I was thinking more like
we call.

790
00:47:18.572 --> 00:47:20.808
You know. I just want to
find out what's going on.

791
00:47:20.842 --> 00:47:23.377
- I don't want to cause a scene.
- Call.

792
00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:24.578
Okay.

793
00:47:30.617 --> 00:47:33.553
Federal Bar and Grill.
May I help you?

794
00:47:33.587 --> 00:47:36.690
- Hi. can I speak to Paige?
- Who's calling?

795
00:47:36.723 --> 00:47:39.426
Tell her it's an old friend.

796
00:47:39.459 --> 00:47:42.229
- Paige.
- Yeah?

797
00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:46.500
Who is it?

798
00:47:46.533 --> 00:47:50.303
She said it's an old friend.

799
00:47:50.337 --> 00:47:51.705
Hello. This is Paige.

800
00:47:51.738 --> 00:47:53.573
Hey. Paige. you need
to watch your back. ho.

801
00:47:53.607 --> 00:47:55.509
What are you doing?

802
00:48:04.018 --> 00:48:05.585
Girl. look.
if you want to do this.

803
00:48:05.619 --> 00:48:07.421
you need to do it the right way.
okay?

804
00:48:07.454 --> 00:48:10.290
Go up there
and bust this nigga out.

805
00:48:10.323 --> 00:48:11.826
Put on your sneakers.

806
00:48:21.501 --> 00:48:23.303
Alright. Jared.
I'll see you tomorrow.

807
00:48:23.336 --> 00:48:24.738
Alright. have a good one.

808
00:51:15.209 --> 00:51:18.745
Hey. babe. you coming to bed?

809
00:51:27.221 --> 00:51:28.956
Nicole?

810
00:51:48.508 --> 00:51:51.678
Ah. yeah. This is...

811
00:51:51.711 --> 00:51:53.114
- It's not what it looks like.
- It's not what it looks like?

812
00:51:53.147 --> 00:51:55.682
No. it's not
what it looks like. baby.

813
00:51:55.715 --> 00:51:57.784
My friends are dying.

814
00:51:57.818 --> 00:52:01.721
and you leave me here alone
while you're running around town

815
00:52:01.755 --> 00:52:03.190
cheating on me
with some other woman?

816
00:52:03.224 --> 00:52:05.525
I am not cheating with you
with some other woman.

817
00:52:05.558 --> 00:52:08.628
I saw her leaving
your mother's house. Brian.

818
00:52:08.662 --> 00:52:10.965
- I can explain that.
- You can explain that?

819
00:52:10.998 --> 00:52:12.900
Well. can you explain why I saw
the two of your arguing

820
00:52:12.934 --> 00:52:15.069
in some random apartment garage?

821
00:52:15.102 --> 00:52:17.704
You've been lying to me.

822
00:52:17.737 --> 00:52:20.074
telling me you're going out
of town on business trips

823
00:52:20.107 --> 00:52:21.574
when really
you've been seeing her.

824
00:52:21.608 --> 00:52:23.177
Will you just stop it. okay?

825
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:25.146
Now. I know what this looks
like. but this is not that.

826
00:52:25.179 --> 00:52:26.713
- Really?
- Really. it's not.

827
00:52:26.746 --> 00:52:27.982
- Really?
- Yeah.

828
00:52:28.015 --> 00:52:31.919
Okay. So who is she?

829
00:52:31.953 --> 00:52:34.754
Who is she?

830
00:52:34.788 --> 00:52:39.160
Okay. first of all.
I'm not cheating on you.

831
00:52:39.193 --> 00:52:43.130
Okay?
Now. yes. I do know this woman.

832
00:52:43.164 --> 00:52:46.666
But it's not what you think.
We work together.

833
00:52:56.077 --> 00:52:59.646
You're lying. You are lying.

834
00:52:59.679 --> 00:53:01.215
Babe. okay. listen.

835
00:53:01.248 --> 00:53:02.582
You got to trust me.
I would not...

836
00:53:02.615 --> 00:53:04.185
You want me to trust you?

837
00:53:04.218 --> 00:53:07.587
When you've never even mentioned
this random beautiful women

838
00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.824
who you work with.
who knows your mother?

839
00:53:09.857 --> 00:53:11.624
Because I knew
how you would react.

840
00:53:11.658 --> 00:53:13.294
I can't even look
at you right now.

841
00:53:13.327 --> 00:53:15.729
Okay. alright.
You want the truth?

842
00:53:15.762 --> 00:53:19.900
- Yeah. I want the truth.
- Okay. truth time.

843
00:53:19.934 --> 00:53:21.534
She told me she was
going to hurt you

844
00:53:21.568 --> 00:53:23.770
if I didn't sleep with her.

845
00:53:23.804 --> 00:53:25.705
Oh. so you did sleep with her.

846
00:53:25.739 --> 00:53:27.640
- No. I did not sleep... I...
- Yes. you did!

847
00:53:27.674 --> 00:53:29.709
No. I didn't.

848
00:53:42.823 --> 00:53:44.025
You slept with her.

849
00:53:44.058 --> 00:53:46.093
No. I didn't. babe.

850
00:53:46.127 --> 00:53:50.663
I'm going to say this
one last time.

851
00:53:50.697 --> 00:53:52.199
I did not touch that woman.

852
00:53:52.233 --> 00:53:54.768
You must think I'm an idiot.

853
00:53:54.801 --> 00:53:56.303
Now. you either believe me
or you don't.

854
00:53:56.337 --> 00:53:57.872
- Well. I don't.
- Okay.

855
00:53:57.905 --> 00:54:00.207
Well. she's crazy. Nicole. Yeah.

856
00:54:00.241 --> 00:54:02.109
And she's capable of a lot.
I was trying to protect you.

857
00:54:02.143 --> 00:54:03.676
You were trying to protect me?

858
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:05.779
- Then you should have been here!
- Okay.

859
00:54:05.813 --> 00:54:06.814
You know what? Just... Just go.

860
00:54:06.847 --> 00:54:09.083
Just go. Just leave.

861
00:54:09.116 --> 00:54:11.886
- Babe. listen to me.
- Get off of me.

862
00:54:11.919 --> 00:54:14.255
Get out of here now.

863
00:54:14.288 --> 00:54:16.824
Okay. Alright.

864
00:54:20.327 --> 00:54:23.696
- Nicole. would I...
- Get out of here!

865
00:54:53.427 --> 00:54:56.796
So I followed her.

866
00:54:56.831 --> 00:54:59.766
and sure enough.
she was there to meet Brian.

867
00:55:02.169 --> 00:55:04.405
So what happened?

868
00:55:04.438 --> 00:55:07.274
I watched them from my car.

869
00:55:07.308 --> 00:55:09.609
They were arguing.
I don't know about what.

870
00:55:11.412 --> 00:55:14.148
I got really upset so I left.

871
00:55:14.181 --> 00:55:18.252
And then Brian came home from
his "out of town" business trip.

872
00:55:18.285 --> 00:55:22.957
and we had this huge argument.
and I had to kick him out.

873
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:27.027
- You kick... You kicked him out?
- Yep.

874
00:55:27.061 --> 00:55:29.163
Oh. my God.

875
00:55:29.196 --> 00:55:30.898
Did you tell Tammy?

876
00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:33.200
Tammy? No.

877
00:55:33.234 --> 00:55:38.005
- Brian would be dead.
- Yeah.

878
00:55:38.038 --> 00:55:39.672
I'm really sorry.

879
00:55:41.475 --> 00:55:45.846
Okay. you know what?
Let's drink some wine.

880
00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.714
Everything's going to be fine.

881
00:55:47.747 --> 00:55:49.283
Here you go.

882
00:55:57.024 --> 00:55:58.791
I love you.

883
00:55:58.826 --> 00:56:00.060
I love you too.
Thanks for coming.

884
00:56:00.094 --> 00:56:02.263
No problem.

885
00:56:02.296 --> 00:56:04.465
That's my girl.
Come on. This is good.

886
00:56:04.498 --> 00:56:06.133
You're going to love it.

887
00:56:16.977 --> 00:56:18.345
I hope you know
I'm spending the night.

888
00:56:18.379 --> 00:56:20.214
Yes. please. of course.

889
00:56:20.247 --> 00:56:23.150
I'm not letting you drive
after all this wine.

890
00:56:23.184 --> 00:56:25.252
- Right?
- It'll be just like

891
00:56:25.286 --> 00:56:26.921
when we had our sleepovers
when we were kids.

892
00:56:26.954 --> 00:56:29.023
Remember when we used to. like.

893
00:56:29.056 --> 00:56:31.392
try and pick which boys
were going to be our husbands?

894
00:56:31.425 --> 00:56:34.228
You remember
I was in love with Usher?

895
00:56:34.261 --> 00:56:36.130
He was my husband.

896
00:56:36.163 --> 00:56:37.464
- Yes. he was.
- Mrs. Usher.

897
00:56:37.498 --> 00:56:39.867
I think you were
obsessed with him. actually.

898
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:43.204
Do you remember when my mom
took me to a concert

899
00:56:43.237 --> 00:56:46.507
when I was 16. and I fainted
after the first song?

900
00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:48.741
- Yep. I do.
- Oh. my God.

901
00:56:48.775 --> 00:56:51.212
Okay. okay. but do you remember

902
00:56:51.245 --> 00:56:53.847
when I was married
to Batman from Immature?

903
00:56:53.881 --> 00:56:56.383
- Oh. my God.
- We had a wedding and everything

904
00:56:56.417 --> 00:56:59.153
and then I found out he was
Roger from "Sister. Sister."

905
00:56:59.186 --> 00:57:02.156
and then we got a divorce.

906
00:57:02.189 --> 00:57:05.526
But I did... I did have
that pillow with his face

907
00:57:05.559 --> 00:57:08.095
spray-painted on it
that I used to cuddle.

908
00:57:08.128 --> 00:57:10.097
- You wouldn't let anyone else...
- No.

909
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:12.799
...sleep on it.

910
00:57:12.833 --> 00:57:15.903
- Oh. my God. those days.
- We were crazy back then.

911
00:57:15.936 --> 00:57:18.038
Yeah.

912
00:57:18.072 --> 00:57:23.844
But we always had
each other's backs though.

913
00:57:23.877 --> 00:57:26.880
No matter what.

914
00:57:26.914 --> 00:57:28.816
Remember the deal.
Nicole.

915
00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:30.384
You still have to kiss him.

916
00:57:30.417 --> 00:57:32.052
It's the only way
that this will work.

917
00:57:32.086 --> 00:57:35.556
Are you crazy?
I'm not kissing Piggy Pete.

918
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:37.191
I have a boyfriend.

919
00:57:37.224 --> 00:57:38.791
Your boyfriend won't know.

920
00:57:38.826 --> 00:57:41.495
Nicole. it's all good.
We got your back.

921
00:57:41.528 --> 00:57:43.564
- You're not in this alone.
- Mm-hmm.

922
00:57:43.597 --> 00:57:45.165
Don't you want
to be in the club?

923
00:57:45.199 --> 00:57:47.201
Yeah. Nicole.

924
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:52.373
Okay. I'll be in the club.

925
00:57:56.076 --> 00:57:58.445
I did not want to kiss him.

926
00:57:58.479 --> 00:58:01.348
Brandi was such a bad influence
on our lives.

927
00:58:01.382 --> 00:58:05.052
I don't know why
I ever listened to her.

928
00:58:05.085 --> 00:58:08.589
Maybe I was scared of her.
I don't know.

929
00:58:08.622 --> 00:58:12.259
Brandi. Miranda.

930
00:58:12.293 --> 00:58:14.561
It's just so scary. you know?

931
00:58:14.595 --> 00:58:17.331
Yeah.

932
00:58:17.364 --> 00:58:21.201
But you know what?
We're going to be fine.

933
00:58:21.235 --> 00:58:23.337
Bae. we have each other.

934
00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:26.840
We have each other's back.
You got me. I got you.

935
00:58:26.874 --> 00:58:28.142
Okay?

936
00:58:28.175 --> 00:58:30.110
Yeah.

937
00:58:30.144 --> 00:58:32.079
- What kind of wine is this?
- The good kind.

938
00:58:32.112 --> 00:58:33.247
Oh. my God.

939
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.015
Darling.

940
00:58:35.049 --> 00:58:36.417
Nothing less.

941
00:58:39.653 --> 00:58:41.355
Ohh.

942
00:58:53.167 --> 00:58:54.902
Sommer?

943
00:59:20.427 --> 00:59:22.129
Sommer?

944
00:59:33.173 --> 00:59:34.375
Sommer?

945
01:00:00.968 --> 01:00:02.703
Now. I'm trying my best
to help you out here. Nicole.

946
01:00:02.736 --> 01:00:05.305
I really am. but you know
how this looks. right?

947
01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:08.208
What. you think I had something
to do with this? That's insane.

948
01:00:08.242 --> 01:00:09.943
You were the last one
to see Miranda alive.

949
01:00:09.977 --> 01:00:11.412
you were the last one
to see Brandi alive.

950
01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:14.148
and you were in this house
when Sommer was murdered.

951
01:00:14.181 --> 01:00:15.616
I mean. somebody must be
trying to frame me.

952
01:00:15.649 --> 01:00:18.018
I apologize. but you got
to come down to the station.

953
01:00:18.051 --> 01:00:19.186
She didn't do anything.

954
01:00:19.219 --> 01:00:20.654
- What?
- We'll find out.

955
01:00:20.687 --> 01:00:21.989
What is this?

956
01:00:32.633 --> 01:00:35.102
Officer.
When we get her down there.

957
01:00:35.135 --> 01:00:37.304
I'm gonna get it right into
my interrogation of her.

958
01:00:37.337 --> 01:00:38.639
- Sir...
- What... What's happening here?

959
01:00:38.672 --> 01:00:40.541
We're taking your wife down
for questioning.

960
01:00:40.574 --> 01:00:43.076
Taking my wife?
Babe. Excu... Excuse...

961
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:46.079
Hello?
Get your hands off my wife.

962
01:00:46.113 --> 01:00:47.414
What is going on?

963
01:00:47.448 --> 01:00:49.249
Babe. are you alright?

964
01:00:49.283 --> 01:00:51.318
Hey! Hey!

965
01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:57.024
She'll be alright.

966
01:00:57.057 --> 01:00:59.226
Babe? B...

967
01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:27.221
I-I'm sorry for
the inconvenience. Mrs. Taylor.

968
01:01:27.254 --> 01:01:29.122
You know your husband's waiting
down in the lobby for you.

969
01:01:29.156 --> 01:01:30.557
He bailed you out.

970
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:34.127
But before you go.
I wanted to share this with you.

971
01:01:37.064 --> 01:01:38.665
We found these
on the crime scene.

972
01:01:41.168 --> 01:01:44.806
They look familiar?
You know anything about that?

973
01:01:44.839 --> 01:01:47.140
- I have no clue.
- Mrs. Taylor.

974
01:01:47.174 --> 01:01:48.810
You must tell me
everything you know

975
01:01:48.843 --> 01:01:50.544
if you want me to help you.

976
01:01:56.851 --> 01:01:58.318
P.

977
01:01:58.352 --> 01:02:00.053
Paige.

978
01:02:00.087 --> 01:02:01.388
Paige?

979
01:02:01.421 --> 01:02:03.825
Yeah. I don't...
I don't know her last name.

980
01:02:03.858 --> 01:02:06.193
My husband was having
an affair with her.

981
01:02:06.226 --> 01:02:08.228
Ooh.

982
01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:11.833
I can tell you
where she works.

983
01:02:11.866 --> 01:02:13.567
He said that she
threatened to hurt me

984
01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.836
if he didn't sleep with her.

985
01:02:14.869 --> 01:02:16.637
Really?

986
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:19.540
Maybe that's what
the P stands for.

987
01:02:19.573 --> 01:02:21.742
Paige.

988
01:02:21.775 --> 01:02:24.444
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

989
01:02:24.478 --> 01:02:26.179
You're free to go. Mrs. Taylor.

990
01:02:42.362 --> 01:02:45.198
Hey. babe.

991
01:02:45.232 --> 01:02:46.366
Are you okay?

992
01:02:49.403 --> 01:02:50.771
Anybody hurt you in there?
You... Are you alright?

993
01:02:50.805 --> 01:02:53.407
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

994
01:02:57.344 --> 01:02:59.680
You leave me
and my wife alone. man.

995
01:02:59.713 --> 01:03:01.715
I'm just doing my job. man.

996
01:03:01.748 --> 01:03:05.218
Doing your job.
Obviously not good enough.

997
01:03:05.252 --> 01:03:06.420
You better hope
you find this person

998
01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:08.155
and catch 'em before I do.

999
01:03:19.566 --> 01:03:21.735
Paige Campbell?

1000
01:03:21.768 --> 01:03:23.337
Who wants to know?

1001
01:03:23.370 --> 01:03:24.806
You've been served.

1002
01:03:24.839 --> 01:03:26.506
This is a temporary
restraining order issued

1003
01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.475
by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Office.

1004
01:03:28.508 --> 01:03:29.710
And you've been ordered to keep

1005
01:03:29.743 --> 01:03:31.411
a no less than 100-yard distance
away from

1006
01:03:31.445 --> 01:03:32.779
Mr. Brian Taylor
and Mrs. Nicole Taylor.

1007
01:03:32.814 --> 01:03:34.348
Do you understand.
Miss Campbell?

1008
01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:36.383
Yeah. but I haven't
done anything wrong.

1009
01:03:36.416 --> 01:03:39.386
Refusing to comply
just gets you arrested.

1010
01:03:39.419 --> 01:03:41.923
Take the package. Miss Campbell.

1011
01:03:41.956 --> 01:03:43.457
That's it. I'm placing you
under arrest right now

1012
01:03:43.490 --> 01:03:44.926
for striking an officer
of the law.

1013
01:03:44.959 --> 01:03:46.660
Give me my... Man. you put
that shit in my face.

1014
01:03:46.693 --> 01:03:48.328
You have the right
to remain silent.

1015
01:03:48.362 --> 01:03:49.696
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

1016
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:51.465
in a court of law.

1017
01:03:57.471 --> 01:04:00.340
Coffee?

1018
01:04:00.374 --> 01:04:03.845
Miranda Scott. Brandi Smith.
and Sommer Harris...

1019
01:04:03.878 --> 01:04:07.681
They felt your wrath.
Why'd you kill 'em?

1020
01:04:07.714 --> 01:04:09.851
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1021
01:04:09.884 --> 01:04:13.286
Yes. you do. Paige.
You sure do.

1022
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:18.592
Or should I call you P?

1023
01:04:18.625 --> 01:04:22.262
I don't know what that is.

1024
01:04:22.295 --> 01:04:24.665
You had no right coming
to my place of business

1025
01:04:24.698 --> 01:04:26.366
disturbing me
with this nonsense.

1026
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.634
I haven't done anything.

1027
01:04:27.668 --> 01:04:31.304
Oh. yes. you have. Paige.
You sure have.

1028
01:04:31.338 --> 01:04:34.307
You assaulted an officer.
You resisted arrest.

1029
01:04:34.341 --> 01:04:35.542
That's two things right there.

1030
01:04:35.575 --> 01:04:37.377
That's enough to lock you up.
I'd say.

1031
01:04:37.411 --> 01:04:41.515
You have no idea what you're
getting in the middle of.

1032
01:04:41.548 --> 01:04:43.951
You cops are so ignorant.

1033
01:04:43.985 --> 01:04:46.386
Well. why don't you
enlighten me. Paige?

1034
01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:50.390
I'm not saying anything more
without my attorney present.

1035
01:04:50.424 --> 01:04:53.460
Fine. You don't want to talk.
I don't want to talk either.

1036
01:04:53.493 --> 01:04:55.495
Just know that your fingerprints
is really all I need.

1037
01:04:55.529 --> 01:04:57.531
and you've been processed.

1038
01:04:57.564 --> 01:05:00.500
So if I was you.
I would start talking

1039
01:05:00.534 --> 01:05:02.003
real. real fast

1040
01:05:02.036 --> 01:05:05.739
before my ignorance
leads me to find out something

1041
01:05:05.772 --> 01:05:08.375
that you don't want me
to find out.

1042
01:05:08.408 --> 01:05:10.945
You think you're so smart.
don't you?

1043
01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:17.584
No?

1044
01:05:17.617 --> 01:05:19.586
Officer Mitchell.

1045
01:05:19.619 --> 01:05:22.389
Get her ass out of here.
Lock her up someplace else.

1046
01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.830
I need you to check the DNA
on these lip prints.

1047
01:05:28.863 --> 01:05:30.998
Okay. Give me a week.
maybe less.

1048
01:05:31.032 --> 01:05:32.699
- I give you a day.
- A day?

1049
01:05:32.733 --> 01:05:35.635
A day.

1050
01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:37.270
- A day. alright. a day.
- 24.

1051
01:05:37.304 --> 01:05:39.706
Alright. 24 hours.
I got you man. alright.

1052
01:06:39.699 --> 01:06:42.636
I have missed you so much.

1053
01:06:42.669 --> 01:06:44.939
And I'm really sorry.
you know that. right?

1054
01:06:46.974 --> 01:06:49.342
Yeah. I know.

1055
01:06:49.376 --> 01:06:51.745
Yeah. about the whole
Paige thing.

1056
01:06:51.778 --> 01:06:53.513
Mm. we don't even
have to go there.

1057
01:06:53.547 --> 01:06:57.684
No. no. yes. yes. I do.
I have to go there.

1058
01:06:57.717 --> 01:06:59.987
I am so sorry
I wasn't honest with you.

1059
01:07:02.156 --> 01:07:06.994
Yeah. well. look.
that's in the past.

1060
01:07:07.028 --> 01:07:09.429
Really. I just want to
forget about it and move on.

1061
01:07:09.462 --> 01:07:11.464
I made a promise
to be honest with you.

1062
01:07:11.498 --> 01:07:13.533
and I broke that promise.

1063
01:07:13.567 --> 01:07:18.005
And I will never make
that mistake again. ever.

1064
01:07:18.039 --> 01:07:21.741
Oh. we don't have to worry
about her anymore.

1065
01:07:21.775 --> 01:07:24.477
Detective Tucker
took care of it.

1066
01:07:24.511 --> 01:07:27.882
He took care... What?
Are you sure?

1067
01:07:30.918 --> 01:07:36.590
Oh. my God. That is...
That's great news. babe.

1068
01:07:36.623 --> 01:07:40.794
Oh. my... we can actually
just finally go back

1069
01:07:40.828 --> 01:07:44.065
to the way things were
before all this started.

1070
01:07:44.098 --> 01:07:46.633
- Yeah.
- Oh. my God. that's fantastic.

1071
01:08:00.915 --> 01:08:02.616
What?

1072
01:08:09.756 --> 01:08:11.926
I thought you told me that
this woman was taken care of?

1073
01:08:11.959 --> 01:08:14.628
I'm sorry. Mrs. Taylor.
but she was bailed out.

1074
01:08:14.661 --> 01:08:16.596
What?

1075
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:17.899
Bailed out by who?

1076
01:08:17.932 --> 01:08:19.532
By an anonymous source.
We don't know.

1077
01:08:19.566 --> 01:08:23.971
An anonymous source.
This is absolutely insane.

1078
01:08:24.005 --> 01:08:26.040
How in the world am I supposed
to keep my wife safe

1079
01:08:26.073 --> 01:08:28.809
from this psycho woman
if you two won't help?

1080
01:08:28.843 --> 01:08:30.211
Huh? Huh?

1081
01:08:30.244 --> 01:08:32.947
I told you she was crazy. babe.
She's crazy.

1082
01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:35.950
What if Nicole was home alone?
Huh? What then?

1083
01:08:35.983 --> 01:08:38.019
She could have killed her.
Detective.

1084
01:08:38.052 --> 01:08:39.786
Is that what it's going to take.
somebody else needs to die

1085
01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:41.222
- before you do something?
- Hey. you better relax. man.

1086
01:08:41.255 --> 01:08:42.689
- Brian.
- You'd better relax.

1087
01:08:42.722 --> 01:08:44.158
- No. you relax.
- Brian. Brian.

1088
01:08:44.191 --> 01:08:46.193
You relax. Listen to me.
If something happens to my wife.

1089
01:08:46.227 --> 01:08:47.895
- man. I swear to God.
- Yeah. put your hands down.

1090
01:08:47.929 --> 01:08:49.063
You don't want to
threaten an officer.

1091
01:08:49.096 --> 01:08:50.563
- Stop.
- Okay. alright.

1092
01:08:50.597 --> 01:08:51.731
- Alright. okay.
- Brian. stop.

1093
01:08:51.765 --> 01:08:55.002
- I have this.
- Okay. Alright.

1094
01:08:55.036 --> 01:08:57.671
Look. you have her
on our security cameras twice.

1095
01:08:57.704 --> 01:08:59.706
We don't have proof that
it was her the first time.

1096
01:08:59.739 --> 01:09:02.575
She is clearly the one
who is doing this.

1097
01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:05.512
She's on camera. She's left
notes with her initials on them.

1098
01:09:05.545 --> 01:09:07.647
How much more proof
do you need?

1099
01:09:07.681 --> 01:09:09.216
All I can say is
I'm doing the best I can.

1100
01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:12.219
Well. your best
is not good enough.

1101
01:09:12.253 --> 01:09:14.021
You can leave now. Detective.

1102
01:09:17.191 --> 01:09:20.227
Fine.

1103
01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:22.897
We out of here.

1104
01:09:25.799 --> 01:09:26.968
Come here.

1105
01:09:27.001 --> 01:09:28.635
Come here.

1106
01:09:28.668 --> 01:09:32.273
It's alright.

1107
01:09:32.306 --> 01:09:34.641
I got some really
interesting information.

1108
01:09:34.674 --> 01:09:36.811
So we ran the DNA sample
that you gave us.

1109
01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:39.713
Turns out Paige Campbell
isn't even her real name.

1110
01:09:39.746 --> 01:09:43.250
It's Samantha Wells.
That name mean anything to you?

1111
01:09:43.284 --> 01:09:45.119
No. Not at all.

1112
01:09:45.152 --> 01:09:47.787
'Cause that's all the
information I could dig up.

1113
01:09:47.822 --> 01:09:48.923
I hope it helps.

1114
01:09:48.956 --> 01:09:50.157
- Thanks.
- Any time.

1115
01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:03.703
Damn.

1116
01:10:03.737 --> 01:10:05.006
Hey. I need your help
getting a closed file.

1117
01:10:05.039 --> 01:10:06.841
You think you can
help me with that?

1118
01:10:06.874 --> 01:10:08.775
I told a friend I'd be there
to save her ass

1119
01:10:08.809 --> 01:10:11.678
when the time came.
and the time is now.

1120
01:10:11.711 --> 01:10:13.780
Why should I trust you?

1121
01:10:13.814 --> 01:10:15.548
Because I trust her.

1122
01:10:19.619 --> 01:10:22.023
Okay.

1123
01:10:25.359 --> 01:10:27.627
This is from Nicole.

1124
01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:29.796
Hope you guys find
what you're looking for.

1125
01:11:05.866 --> 01:11:07.968
Damn.

1126
01:11:08.002 --> 01:11:10.337
Samantha Wells
is Peter Wells' sister?

1127
01:11:12.873 --> 01:11:14.809
I never even knew
he had a sister.

1128
01:11:14.842 --> 01:11:16.944
Well. apparently nobody did.

1129
01:11:16.977 --> 01:11:19.380
When Peter was a baby
and Samantha was 3.

1130
01:11:19.413 --> 01:11:21.849
Mr. and Mrs. Wells adopted them.

1131
01:11:23.384 --> 01:11:25.820
I told him
the same thing.

1132
01:11:25.853 --> 01:11:27.121
Oh. hello. sir. May I help you?

1133
01:11:27.154 --> 01:11:29.156
Hi. ma'am.
I'm here for Samantha Wells.

1134
01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:31.992
Officer. what's the problem?

1135
01:11:32.026 --> 01:11:34.395
You're under arrest for
the murders of Miranda Scott.

1136
01:11:34.428 --> 01:11:36.130
Brandi Smith. and Sommer Harris.

1137
01:11:36.163 --> 01:11:37.764
What? What is this about?

1138
01:11:37.797 --> 01:11:39.967
What is happening?
I don't understand.

1139
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.302
Elda. don't say another word.

1140
01:11:41.335 --> 01:11:42.837
Go back in the house
and call the lawyer.

1141
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:44.238
Everything's going to be okay.

1142
01:11:44.271 --> 01:11:45.906
But I don't understand
what's going on here.

1143
01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:47.740
A few days after the incident
between you all

1144
01:11:47.774 --> 01:11:49.877
and Peter Wells
at the summer camp.

1145
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:52.980
Peter Wells committed suicide.

1146
01:11:53.013 --> 01:11:55.950
A year later. Samantha's
living on the streets.

1147
01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:57.418
and she's there for a while.

1148
01:11:57.451 --> 01:12:01.021
but she ended up back
in the foster care system.

1149
01:12:01.055 --> 01:12:04.125
But after that. no one heard
of her until last year

1150
01:12:04.158 --> 01:12:09.263
when she moved back to LA under
the name of Paige Campbell.

1151
01:12:09.296 --> 01:12:11.031
Oh. my God.

1152
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:16.003
She probably blamed us
for her brother's death.

1153
01:12:16.036 --> 01:12:17.838
Probably.

1154
01:12:17.872 --> 01:12:22.309
Killing and trying to make it
look like a suicide.

1155
01:12:22.343 --> 01:12:24.145
She wanted you
to know it was her.

1156
01:12:24.178 --> 01:12:26.881
She wanted to take my husband
away from me as payback.

1157
01:12:26.914 --> 01:12:29.984
Listen. You said you and your
friends played a joke on Peter?

1158
01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:32.652
Who exactly was there?

1159
01:12:34.787 --> 01:12:40.327
It was Miranda. Brandi.
Sommer. and myself.

1160
01:12:40.361 --> 01:12:42.196
You were going to be the fourth.

1161
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:45.366
- She was saving you for last.
- Officer!

1162
01:12:45.399 --> 01:12:47.067
You have the right
to an attorney.

1163
01:12:47.101 --> 01:12:48.969
If you cannot afford one.
one will be provided for you

1164
01:12:49.003 --> 01:12:50.803
by the court.
Do you understand your rights?

1165
01:12:50.838 --> 01:12:52.907
I don't even know what
precinct you're taking her to.

1166
01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.408
Could you at least tell me that?

1167
01:12:54.441 --> 01:12:55.976
Ma'am. please go back inside.

1168
01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:58.979
Oh. this is just ridiculous!
Ridiculous!

1169
01:12:59.013 --> 01:13:01.448
I'm going to call
somebody for you. baby.

1170
01:13:01.482 --> 01:13:04.351
God. this is a nightmare.

1171
01:13:06.453 --> 01:13:09.056
Well. the nightmare's
over now. okay?

1172
01:13:09.089 --> 01:13:11.458
We got Samantha.

1173
01:13:11.492 --> 01:13:13.793
We good.

1174
01:13:13.827 --> 01:13:17.198
She won't be hurting
nobody no time soon.

1175
01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:20.134
"We the jury find
the defendant. Samantha Wells.

Samantha Wells. you have been
found guilty on all counts.

Sentencing will be

01:13:49.964 --> 01:13:51.865
Court is adjourned.

1186
01:13:51.899 --> 01:13:54.068
All rise for

Congratulations.

1188

And I'm sorry for being

Nah. nah. nah. it's okay.

Thank you. Detective.

No. thank you.

1195
01:14:23.998 --> 01:14:25.099
Thank you.

You all ready to go. babe?

- Bag is packed. face is on.

Just have to put my dress on.
and then I'm all yours.

1201
01:14:52.026 --> 01:14:53.894
Oh. well. I made
your favorite tea.

1202
01:14:53.927 --> 01:14:56.530
- Aww.
- Boom.

1203
01:14:56.563 --> 01:15:00.134
Can you believe it?
Four years ago. babe.

1204
01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:06.373
I married the most beautiful
woman in the entire world.

1205
01:15:06.407 --> 01:15:08.909
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

1206
01:15:08.942 --> 01:15:12.479
Mm. Well. guess what?

1207
01:15:12.513 --> 01:15:14.581
- Hmm?
- What?

1208
01:15:14.615 --> 01:15:17.518
I have an entire night
planned for you.

1209
01:15:17.551 --> 01:15:20.287
And I know everything's been
a bit of a train wreck lately.

1210
01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:24.425
but just for tonight I want us
to just forget about everything.

1211
01:15:24.458 --> 01:15:27.294
focus on us.

1212
01:15:27.328 --> 01:15:29.496
- I like that idea.
- Mm.

1213
01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:31.999
Drink up now. Drink it up.

1214
01:15:32.032 --> 01:15:34.501
You need some energy
for what we doing tonight.

1215
01:15:34.535 --> 01:15:39.473
- Ooh?
- Uh-huh.

1216
01:15:39.506 --> 01:15:42.276
It's a surprise.

1217
01:15:42.309 --> 01:15:44.144
I love surprises.

1218
01:16:05.232 --> 01:16:06.200
Yeah?

1219
01:16:06.233 --> 01:16:08.102
Oh. hey. Kenny.

1220
01:16:08.135 --> 01:16:11.572
Okay. Sure.

1221
01:16:20.681 --> 01:16:23.150
You got to be kidding me.

1222
01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:35.529
Nicole?

1223
01:16:35.562 --> 01:16:37.297
Nicole?

1224
01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.403
Come out.
come out wherever you are.

1225
01:16:51.612 --> 01:16:54.548
Brian?

1226
01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:58.118
Brian?

1227
01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:16.603
Nicole.

1228
01:17:16.637 --> 01:17:19.573
Nicole. come out
wherever you are.

1229
01:17:28.649 --> 01:17:31.318
Come on.

1230
01:17:34.087 --> 01:17:36.256
Come on.

1231
01:17:41.562 --> 01:17:44.364
Come on. Come on.

1232
01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.235
Come on.

1233
01:17:57.678 --> 01:18:00.013
Hurry up. come on.

1234
01:18:21.468 --> 01:18:24.638
Nicole! It's Detective Tucker!

1235
01:18:27.641 --> 01:18:28.775
Hey!

1236
01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:31.478
Hey! Hi!

1237
01:18:31.512 --> 01:18:34.348
Is everything okay?
I actually... I live next door.

1238
01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:36.583
No. no. I'm looking
for Brian and Nicole.

1239
01:18:36.617 --> 01:18:39.253
Actually it's their anniversary.
so they may be gone.

1240
01:18:39.286 --> 01:18:40.554
Do you know where they are?

1241
01:18:40.587 --> 01:18:42.189
You got me there.
No. I don't. I'm sorry.

1242
01:18:42.222 --> 01:18:44.224
Jesus.

1243
01:18:44.258 --> 01:18:45.592
Damn it.

1244
01:18:45.626 --> 01:18:48.195
Damn it.

1245
01:18:48.228 --> 01:18:50.497
I hope everything's
going to be okay.

1246
01:18:50.531 --> 01:18:52.366
Geez.

1247
01:18:59.673 --> 01:19:01.441
Come on.

1248
01:19:21.728 --> 01:19:24.097
Piggy Pete.

1249
01:19:34.441 --> 01:19:36.143
Nicole?

1250
01:19:41.748 --> 01:19:44.117
This is where
I had my first kiss.

1251
01:19:46.753 --> 01:19:49.857
It was with you.

1252
01:19:49.891 --> 01:19:51.859
Peter.

1253
01:19:57.899 --> 01:20:02.302
So. you figured it out.

1254
01:20:08.241 --> 01:20:10.744
I don't understand.

1255
01:20:10.777 --> 01:20:14.147
We were just kids.
We didn't mean to hurt you.

1256
01:20:14.181 --> 01:20:17.384
No. Don't act all innocent.
Nicole.

1257
01:20:17.417 --> 01:20:20.754
You... You guys. you know
what you did out there.

1258
01:20:20.787 --> 01:20:22.522
You know what you did to me.

1259
01:20:24.625 --> 01:20:30.163
You killed me. Nicole.
you and your little friends.

1260
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:37.872
Wait. this one. alright.

1261
01:20:48.548 --> 01:20:50.250
Peter. wake up!
Nicole's in trouble.

1262
01:20:50.283 --> 01:20:52.820
- Come on. hurry.
- I'm coming.

1263
01:20:57.591 --> 01:20:59.927
- Nicole! Come on. let's go!
- Come on. jump!

1264
01:20:59.961 --> 01:21:01.328
- Come on. she's drowning!
- Save her!

1265
01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:03.597
- She's drowning!
- She can't swim!

1266
01:21:08.402 --> 01:21:09.971
Help!

1267
01:21:10.004 --> 01:21:12.239
I can't swim!

1268
01:21:12.272 --> 01:21:14.741
You guys. if he keeps shouting.
we're saving him.

1269
01:21:14.775 --> 01:21:16.610
We have to. Sommer.
go get help now.

1270
01:21:16.643 --> 01:21:18.980
Okay. okay.

1271
01:21:19.013 --> 01:21:20.982
- I'm out of here.
- Help!

1272
01:21:21.015 --> 01:21:23.951
Brandi. we can't let him drown.
Help me get him out of here.

1273
01:21:23.985 --> 01:21:25.519
I'm sorry. Nicole.
You're on your own.

1274
01:21:25.552 --> 01:21:27.688
I cannot get in trouble
for this.

1275
01:21:29.723 --> 01:21:31.893
Don't leave me here.

1276
01:21:36.797 --> 01:21:39.766
Peter! Peter.
it's going to be okay.

1277
01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.736
I'm sorry.

1278
01:21:42.769 --> 01:21:43.971
Peter. grab my hand.

1279
01:21:53.047 --> 01:21:57.718
I jumped in that water
to save you. Nicole.

1280
01:21:57.751 --> 01:21:59.854
and you let me drown.

1281
01:21:59.887 --> 01:22:03.423
No. No. that's...
That's not what happened.

1282
01:22:03.457 --> 01:22:04.892
You have this all wrong.

1283
01:22:04.926 --> 01:22:06.994
But you can't kill me.

1284
01:22:07.028 --> 01:22:11.465
I'm... I was too strong.

1285
01:22:11.498 --> 01:22:13.000
Yeah.

1286
01:22:13.034 --> 01:22:15.569
He's still not breathing.
We need to rush him to the ER.

1287
01:22:24.611 --> 01:22:26.546
You stopped breathing.
but you would have died

1288
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.982
if I didn't try to save you.

1289
01:22:28.015 --> 01:22:30.450
You know I tried
to kill myself that summer?

1290
01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.989
Yeah.

1291
01:22:35.022 --> 01:22:38.391
Samantha.
she found me in the room.

1292
01:22:38.425 --> 01:22:42.063
Alone. bleeding
from my wrist.

1293
01:22:42.096 --> 01:22:45.066
And our foster parents.
they were...

1294
01:22:45.099 --> 01:22:48.401
they were...
they were going to put me away.

1295
01:22:51.404 --> 01:22:53.841
So she took me and we...
we just... we ran.

1296
01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:55.076
We ran away.

1297
01:22:55.109 --> 01:22:59.379
And we were on the street
alone for months

1298
01:22:59.412 --> 01:23:00.848
before they found us again.

1299
01:23:00.882 --> 01:23:04.584
and then back into the system
we went. you know?

1300
01:23:04.618 --> 01:23:07.621
Two kids. just nowhere to go.

1301
01:23:07.654 --> 01:23:11.558
And that's... that's kind of

1302
01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:16.097
when everything really
just changed for us.

1303
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:18.732
- Elda.
- Mm-hmm.

1304
01:23:20.968 --> 01:23:24.071
Ding. ding. ding.
ding. ding. ding.

1305
01:23:33.114 --> 01:23:36.951
Oh. Elda.
She was... She was so nice.

1306
01:23:36.984 --> 01:23:39.619
She... She... She took us in.
and we were...

1307
01:23:41.956 --> 01:23:45.559
She gave me a new name.

1308
01:23:45.592 --> 01:23:51.698
And gave us new life. you know?

1309
01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:55.837
Like. I really started
to feel good about myself.

1310
01:23:55.870 --> 01:24:00.808
And I was healing.

1311
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:07.514
Until that one day years later.

1312
01:24:07.547 --> 01:24:10.017
I... I saw you. saw you.

1313
01:24:10.051 --> 01:24:12.019
you and your...
your... your friends

1314
01:24:12.053 --> 01:24:18.625
just passing by me
at your school and...

1315
01:24:18.658 --> 01:24:20.460
That's when it hit me.

1316
01:24:20.493 --> 01:24:27.869
I decided to make it my purpose
to get my revenge.

1317
01:24:27.902 --> 01:24:32.572
And I wasn't...

1318
01:24:32.606 --> 01:24:36.143
Piggy Pete anymore.

1319
01:24:36.177 --> 01:24:38.079
I was Brian Taylor.

1320
01:24:38.112 --> 01:24:40.747
How is this possible?

1321
01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:43.683
How is it possible?
Oh. my God.

1322
01:24:43.717 --> 01:24:48.856
Oh. my God. it was...
it was so easy.

1323
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:52.592
I was there
the whole entire time.

1324
01:24:52.626 --> 01:24:55.495
you know. throughout
high school. college.

1325
01:24:55.528 --> 01:24:58.465
You just can't even notice me.

1326
01:25:04.939 --> 01:25:06.706
The entire time.

1327
01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:09.676
I-I-I just followed you.

1328
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:12.445
I knew your every move
better than you did.

1329
01:25:12.479 --> 01:25:16.483
I knew you'd message me back.
I knew what to say.

1330
01:25:16.516 --> 01:25:19.053
I knew exactly what you wanted
to hear. Nicole.

1331
01:25:19.086 --> 01:25:21.088
what you needed to hear.

1332
01:25:23.224 --> 01:25:26.193
And then we met again.

1333
01:25:26.227 --> 01:25:28.561
For the first time.

1334
01:25:49.016 --> 01:25:52.719
A-And now. you know.

1335
01:25:52.752 --> 01:25:58.092
I went through so much.

1336
01:25:58.125 --> 01:26:04.165
Things a-a-a child should
never have to experience.

1337
01:26:06.599 --> 01:26:09.170
All because of you.

1338
01:26:09.203 --> 01:26:14.976
You. Brandi. and Miranda.
and Sommer.

1339
01:26:15.009 --> 01:26:19.779
And they all got
what the deserved.

1340
01:26:24.751 --> 01:26:26.486
Now it's your turn.

1341
01:29:34.475 --> 01:29:37.111
Nicole!

1342
01:30:18.285 --> 01:30:22.489
Doesn't have to end like this.

1343
01:30:22.523 --> 01:30:24.892
We could start
a new life. Nicole.

1344
01:30:27.861 --> 01:30:30.164
I love you.

1345
01:30:30.197 --> 01:30:32.399
I...

1346
01:30:32.433 --> 01:30:35.502
Nicole. where are...

1347
01:30:35.536 --> 01:30:38.305
Nicole!

1348
01:30:38.339 --> 01:30:40.441
Nicole!

1349
01:30:40.474 --> 01:30:43.010
Oh!

1350
01:32:00.654 --> 01:32:06.360
Hey. Hey. Nicole.

1351
01:32:06.393 --> 01:32:09.129
It's... It's me.

1352
01:32:09.163 --> 01:32:14.601
It's me. Peter.
Do you remember? Huh?

1353
01:32:14.635 --> 01:32:18.572
Yeah. you remember.
You s... You saved me once.

1354
01:32:18.605 --> 01:32:20.307
Yeah.

1355
01:32:28.649 --> 01:32:32.152
Now. who's... who's...
who's going to save you?

1356
01:32:32.186 --> 01:32:36.323
Brian. Peter. Don't do this.

1357
01:32:36.357 --> 01:32:39.960
Don't... Don't do this? Don't...

1358
01:32:39.993 --> 01:32:43.230
You know that I've...
I've been...

1359
01:32:43.263 --> 01:32:50.070
I've been waiting all these
years for... for today.

1360
01:32:50.104 --> 01:32:54.408
This exact moment.

1361
01:32:54.441 --> 01:32:56.443
This very moment.

1362
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:04.485
Always and forever. baby.

1363
01:34:18.559 --> 01:34:22.262
Peter. please.

1364
01:34:57.531 --> 01:35:00.634
Nicole.

1365
01:35:00.667 --> 01:35:02.636
Are you okay?

1366
01:35:02.669 --> 01:35:04.438
Yeah.

1367
01:35:06.707 --> 01:35:08.609
Need you to check on her.

1368
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:53.253
Always...

1369
01:35:53.287 --> 01:35:55.656
And forever.
