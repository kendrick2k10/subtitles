00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.248
- What are you doing?

4
00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:26.167
I want a picture.

5
00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:27.247
- What?

6
00:00:27.247 --> 00:00:29.826
I just want a picture.

7
00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:32.051
I want a picture with you

8
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:33.301
in this moment.

9
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.710
like a dark shade of orange

10
00:01:05.912 --> 00:01:07.670
like my city had a mouth

11
00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:11.072
when I get it Imma burn it

12
00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:13.082
right now even deserve it

13
00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:16.790
a penny turn to gold

14
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.601
and the money and the fame

15
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:21.512
fruit if you choose

16
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.700
gold and a house up on a lake

17
00:01:26.072 --> 00:01:29.107
and lamb in the garage

18
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.049
they really wanna get involved

19
00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.768
off in the elevator

20
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.653
I have a nice time with it

21
00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:52.006
way to the right side of him

22
00:01:58.665 --> 00:02:00.455
sit up on my ottoman

23
00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:02.257
otter with no time to kill

24
00:02:02.257 --> 00:02:04.199
opposite of worthless

25
00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:06.589
a purposeful thing to me

26
00:02:06.589 --> 00:02:07.988
and it works for me

27
00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:09.929
and putting money into pushing

28
00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.006
and I'm getting overlooked

29
00:02:13.857 --> 00:02:15.608
everything that I deserve

30
00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:45.744
- Hey man. that'll be like 10 bucks.

31
00:02:48.624 --> 00:02:51.957
It's not even what I ordered.

32
00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:55.374
- Just take the fucking shit and go. guy.

33
00:02:57.917 --> 00:02:59.386
- Asshole.

34
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.053
- Did you cum in front of that guy?

35
00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:18.172
- I told you if you do that
thing with your tongue.

36
00:03:18.172 --> 00:03:19.926
I'll nut every time.

37
00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:21.975
- You're the worst.

38
00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:23.826
How do you even still have this job?

39
00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:24.659
- Oh. come on.

40
00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.816
Nobody else in this fucking
town wants this job.

41
00:03:26.816 --> 00:03:29.478
I don't even want this fucking job.

42
00:03:29.478 --> 00:03:32.395
They need me more than I need them.

43
00:03:33.785 --> 00:03:37.702
So you wanna go to the
back and I'll. you know.

44
00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:51.621
- Oh. hey. I was this
town's second gay man.

45
00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:52.454
All right?

46
00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:53.309
It was 1997--

47
00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.560
- '97. and I was 12 years old.

48
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.699
and a couple eighth graders caught me

49
00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.181
in the boys' bathroom at school.

50
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.160
jacking off to a Jonathan
Taylor Thomas photo.

51
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.730
Everyone found out now I'm
this town's Freddie Mercury.

52
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.410
- Hey fuck nut. I tell
it better than that.

53
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.610
- Maybe.

54
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.560
I don't need to hear it again.

55
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.000
So fucking what?

56
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.330
There had to be hundreds of gay men

57
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.549
in this town before you.

58
00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.654
and they'll be hundreds after.

59
00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:17.309
You aren't fucking special.

60
00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.189
And by your own admission.

61
00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:20.600
you weren't even the
first to come out. so.

62
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.600
- Yeah. but.

63
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.855
right. I guess there's that dirty ass pedo

64
00:04:25.855 --> 00:04:26.688
over on Marshall Street.

65
00:04:26.688 --> 00:04:27.666
- Last house on the left.

66
00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:29.124
- Yeah. right.

67
00:04:29.124 --> 00:04:30.458
But he hardly fucking counts.

68
00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:34.328
I mean. everybody knows
he's liked boys since 1973.

69
00:04:34.328 --> 00:04:36.488
that doesn't count.

70
00:04:43.957 --> 00:04:45.048
God damn.

71
00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:46.597
Best feeling in the world
must be taking a piss

72
00:04:46.597 --> 00:04:48.549
after cumming.

73
00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:50.127
- You're a fucking jerk. Mitch.

74
00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:50.960
- Hey. watch it. Jenny.

75
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.710
I'm trynna piss here.

76
00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:55.152
- Yo. Harry.

77
00:05:00.408 --> 00:05:02.848
- This town sucks so hard.

78
00:05:02.848 --> 00:05:03.865
- I don't know.

79
00:05:03.865 --> 00:05:04.968
Could be worse.

80
00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:06.457
- A lot worse.

81
00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:08.137
- Oh. you mean like Soviet Russia?

82
00:05:08.137 --> 00:05:09.977
- Oh. fuck you.

83
00:05:11.826 --> 00:05:13.385
- I'm not from here either.

84
00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:15.877
- Well. yeah. but you're cute.

85
00:05:15.877 --> 00:05:17.768
So what's
your real name. Mike?

86
00:05:17.768 --> 00:05:20.672
- What kind of stupid question is that?

87
00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:21.654
- I just wanna know.

88
00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:23.346
Is that bad to ask?

89
00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:24.929
- No. it's Nikolai.

90
00:05:27.888 --> 00:05:30.037
- See. you might learn something. asshole.

91
00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:31.594
- Whatever. Krissy.

92
00:05:31.594 --> 00:05:33.368
You know I hate that.

93
00:05:33.368 --> 00:05:35.368
Okay. Kristen.

94
00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:40.511
- See those fucking yahoos out there?

95
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:44.355
Those PC. no opinion.
sheepo fucks are who I have

96
00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:45.845
to deal with every God damn day.

97
00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:49.344
so believe me. it's not all
fun times at Ridgemont High.

98
00:05:49.344 --> 00:05:54.199
- Ah. it's Fast Times at
Ridgemont High. fuck nut.

99
00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.032
When you get talking like that.

100
00:05:55.032 --> 00:05:59.256
you sound like a cynical.
wrinkly old queen.

101
00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:00.165
Do you know what?

102
00:06:00.165 --> 00:06:01.224
From now on.

103
00:06:01.224 --> 00:06:05.307
I will consider myself
this town's first gay man.

104
00:06:07.046 --> 00:06:07.936
So fuck that.

105
00:06:07.936 --> 00:06:10.571
The dirty pedo doesn't count.

106
00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:12.466
- He counts. baby.

107
00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:14.133
I'll call you later.

108
00:06:23.017 --> 00:06:26.584
Ah. Jenner. you can
smell Ricky's cum from here.

109
00:06:26.584 --> 00:06:28.237
- Fuck you. Mitch.

110
00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:30.117
That's not my name.

111
00:06:30.117 --> 00:06:30.950
Hey.

112
00:06:35.637 --> 00:06:38.247
You're sucking that dart like a faggot.

113
00:06:38.247 --> 00:06:40.838
- Don't use that word.

114
00:06:40.838 --> 00:06:41.671
- What?

115
00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:45.778
Don't give me that
politically correct bullshit.

116
00:06:45.778 --> 00:06:47.578
I can say what I want.

117
00:06:47.578 --> 00:06:48.869
You know. I can't keep it straight

118
00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:53.869
with what F word or G word or
M word is offensive this week.

119
00:06:55.535 --> 00:06:58.107
You know. not everyone is nice.

120
00:06:58.107 --> 00:07:01.165
Not everyone can accept
everyone as they are.

121
00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:03.181
and actually thinking that's
possible is fucking insane.

122
00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:04.598
so you know what?

123
00:07:06.183 --> 00:07:08.663
I'll fucking say anything I want.

124
00:07:08.663 --> 00:07:11.924
you cracker dike. fucking
carpet munching piece

125
00:07:11.924 --> 00:07:14.069
of fucking retarded nigger-loving.

126
00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:15.485
vertical stink wallet.

127
00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:17.827
piece of fucking retarded diarrhea.

128
00:07:17.827 --> 00:07:20.717
shit licking Jew. faggot. cunt.

129
00:07:26.147 --> 00:07:26.980
- Dude.

130
00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:36.626
Travis is
having a fucking party.

131
00:07:36.626 --> 00:07:38.879
Travis Turner?

132
00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.564
What the hell are you doing
with that lunatic's number?

133
00:07:41.564 --> 00:07:44.638
- He takes good calculus notes.

134
00:07:44.638 --> 00:07:48.388
He says. "No parents
and free beer" and shit.

135
00:07:49.412 --> 00:07:50.245
- I couldn't care less

136
00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:52.292
if fucking Charles Manson threw a party.

137
00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:54.243
Free beer. I'm there.

138
00:07:54.243 --> 00:07:55.910
- Ooga. ooga. Putin.

139
00:07:57.332 --> 00:08:00.272
Booga. wooga. MSG and shit.

140
00:08:00.272 --> 00:08:02.112
Come on. take a bite.

141
00:08:02.112 --> 00:08:02.945
Take a bite of it--

142
00:08:02.945 --> 00:08:04.382
- Hey. I'm allergic to nuts.

143
00:08:05.592 --> 00:08:07.558
I fucking knew it.

144
00:08:07.558 --> 00:08:08.583
I'm more dangerous

145
00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:11.122
than a fucking pissed off
Trump supporter with a gun.

146
00:08:11.122 --> 00:08:12.642
I'll fucking kill a bitch.

147
00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:18.176
Peace. losers.

148
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.183
- He's fucking mentally ill.

149
00:08:23.082 --> 00:08:25.041
- So we're gonna go to that thing or what?

150
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:26.610
- Look. Travis is a shit nugget.

151
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.241
Columbine shooter waiting to happen.

152
00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:32.526
but yeah. what the fuck else
is there to do around here?

153
00:08:32.526 --> 00:08:34.776
- Tonight feels weird. man.

154
00:08:35.632 --> 00:08:38.701
- You know. they are not
coming tonight. right dude?

155
00:08:43.383 --> 00:08:44.390
Hey.

156
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.021
- Travis. what the fuck. man.

157
00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:48.170
I had to find out about your party

158
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.461
from fucking Mitch and those chachas.

159
00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:52.190
Yeah. sorry. man.

160
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.862
I was gonna message you.

161
00:08:53.862 --> 00:08:55.019
Had a lot to do.

162
00:08:55.019 --> 00:08:57.019
Getting ready and shit.

163
00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:58.507
- How the fuck is this possible?

164
00:08:58.507 --> 00:09:00.680
How do you even have a phone right now?

165
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.221
My parents left
for Florida for the weekend.

166
00:09:03.221 --> 00:09:04.650
I stole my phone back.

167
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.139
- Jesus. dude. so you decide
to throw a fucking rager?

168
00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:09.355
Yeah.

169
00:09:09.355 --> 00:09:11.036
- You know by telling
Harry. Kristen. Mitch.

170
00:09:11.036 --> 00:09:13.158
and those fuck there's
gonna be like 30 people

171
00:09:13.158 --> 00:09:14.326
at your house.

172
00:09:14.326 --> 00:09:15.159
You think?

173
00:09:15.159 --> 00:09:16.278
- I'm coming over now.

174
00:09:16.278 --> 00:09:18.678
Sweet man. I'll see you soon.

175
00:09:24.267 --> 00:09:26.267
- You went all out. huh?

176
00:09:27.906 --> 00:09:28.966
- Yeah. man.

177
00:09:28.966 --> 00:09:32.487
Gonna be hectic like one
of those teen party movies.

178
00:09:32.487 --> 00:09:33.320
I've even got stacks

179
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.413
of those red fucking cups you always see.

180
00:09:35.413 --> 00:09:36.246
- Mhm.

181
00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:48.006
You think this is the right thing to do?

182
00:09:48.006 --> 00:09:50.589
- This is the only thing to do.

183
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.970
- Okay.

184
00:09:58.346 --> 00:10:00.318
I got my mind on loot

185
00:10:01.848 --> 00:10:03.718
woke up in a Bugatti.

186
00:10:10.138 --> 00:10:11.760
ready 'bout that action

187
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.520
I am living proof

188
00:10:27.317 --> 00:10:29.914
they see how many days

189
00:10:33.136 --> 00:10:36.795
told me just to go for it

190
00:11:00.976 --> 00:11:03.980
'cause I got a better sale

191
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.468
- You're with Mitch. right?

192
00:11:08.792 --> 00:11:10.858
New girl this year.

193
00:11:10.858 --> 00:11:12.900
How's that been?

194
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.770
- Used to moving.

195
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.853
This town blows. but has
some interesting people.

196
00:11:20.842 --> 00:11:23.671
- You're right about that.

197
00:11:23.671 --> 00:11:25.172
- Not to be offensive.

198
00:11:25.172 --> 00:11:26.172
but why him?

199
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:29.161
I mean like he's smart.

200
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:32.612
He gives me notes in class and shit.

201
00:11:32.612 --> 00:11:34.900
- We were 10 years old.

202
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.225
playing a basketball
game in another school.

203
00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:40.972
Travis and I were on the bench. of course.

204
00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:42.840
'cause we sucked.

205
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.257
but for some reason. the coach put me in.

206
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:50.814
I got the ball and tried to make a pass.

207
00:11:54.216 --> 00:11:56.248
It went like a foot.

208
00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:57.528
The other team picked it up and scored.

209
00:11:57.528 --> 00:12:01.368
and coach took me off.
and then one of the kids

210
00:12:01.368 --> 00:12:03.608
from the other team yelled over at me.

211
00:12:03.608 --> 00:12:05.775
"You throw like a faggot."

212
00:12:07.896 --> 00:12:10.188
After the game was over.

213
00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.387
we were walking out of the school.

214
00:12:11.387 --> 00:12:12.903
and Travis sees the kid who yelled at me.

215
00:12:12.903 --> 00:12:16.913
and he ran over to him and
punched him in the face.

216
00:12:16.913 --> 00:12:18.163
Broke his nose.

217
00:12:19.242 --> 00:12:22.893
He was suspended for like five days.

218
00:12:22.893 --> 00:12:26.143
From that day on. we were best friends.

219
00:12:27.722 --> 00:12:32.061
me. they say. "Oh Lord"

220
00:12:39.711 --> 00:12:43.311
God you dodge a tomb

221
00:12:45.975 --> 00:12:49.142
- Aren't you excited to join the club?

222
00:12:50.714 --> 00:12:55.047
- I'm excited to just feel
comfortable with my body.

223
00:12:59.689 --> 00:13:01.447
What about you. huh?

224
00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:02.938
What?

225
00:13:02.938 --> 00:13:06.631
- You're different than those bitches.

226
00:13:06.631 --> 00:13:10.964
- I tried that shit for
awhile. the feminist circle.

227
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.291
I went to the meetings.
read all their shit.

228
00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:16.741
joined all the Facebook groups.

229
00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:20.031
you know. like the typical shit.

230
00:13:20.031 --> 00:13:22.448
Something just. I don't know.

231
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.701
felt so fake about the whole thing.

232
00:13:25.701 --> 00:13:27.351
- What do you mean?

233
00:13:27.351 --> 00:13:28.791
- I'm not even in college.

234
00:13:28.791 --> 00:13:30.471
and I've read and watched all the things

235
00:13:30.471 --> 00:13:32.002
that you need to.

236
00:13:32.002 --> 00:13:32.835
and these chicks

237
00:13:32.835 --> 00:13:35.541
at these meetings would just
regurgitate the same shit

238
00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:39.591
over and over. and the new
girls would just eat it up.

239
00:13:39.591 --> 00:13:42.322
I mean. I don't need some
20-year-old fucking hippie

240
00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:43.653
to explain Virginia Woolf

241
00:13:43.653 --> 00:13:46.320
and the Vagina Monologues to me.

242
00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:50.434
What was hard to understand
is what are we doing

243
00:13:50.434 --> 00:13:54.783
in this third wave or
whatever wave we're in?

244
00:13:54.783 --> 00:13:58.033
I don't think it can
be any more ambiguous.

245
00:13:58.033 --> 00:14:01.133
Nobody knows what the fuck we're doing.

246
00:14:01.133 --> 00:14:02.954
The biggest reason why I
left is because we were

247
00:14:02.954 --> 00:14:05.537
at a meeting in circle sharing.

248
00:14:06.403 --> 00:14:08.605
and I decided to join in.

249
00:14:08.605 --> 00:14:09.438
- Oh. boy.

250
00:14:10.543 --> 00:14:15.543
- Yeah. I said out loud that
my dream was to finish college.

251
00:14:15.663 --> 00:14:19.125
and to become a wife. and a
stay-at-home mom to three kids.

252
00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:21.005
- Didn't go over well. did it?

253
00:14:21.005 --> 00:14:24.365
- I couldn't understand
why if I'm a free woman.

254
00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:28.004
why can't I choose to
be mom and to be a wife?

255
00:14:28.004 --> 00:14:30.725
Like just like. it's a choice to be a CEO

256
00:14:30.725 --> 00:14:32.563
of some big company.

257
00:14:32.563 --> 00:14:35.313
it's my choice to be a homemaker.

258
00:14:36.245 --> 00:14:40.863
Somehow they not only
couldn't respect me for it.

259
00:14:40.863 --> 00:14:45.175
they couldn't see how
hypocritical they were being.

260
00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:47.758
So I said. "Fuck that. I'm out.

261
00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:53.154
"I'll have to figure
this shit out on my own."

262
00:14:53.154 --> 00:14:55.933
- Wow. we need to hang out more.

263
00:14:55.933 --> 00:14:59.293
- Yeah. we don't exactly
run in the same circle.

264
00:14:59.293 --> 00:15:01.341
I mean. not that there's circles

265
00:15:01.341 --> 00:15:03.274
at this fucking school. but still.

266
00:15:03.274 --> 00:15:06.253
- I know. just being who I am at my age.

267
00:15:06.253 --> 00:15:08.893
not a lot of kids can handle that.

268
00:15:08.893 --> 00:15:11.133
especially around here.

269
00:15:11.133 --> 00:15:12.941
- Nah. I get it.

270
00:15:22.573 --> 00:15:26.333
- So why the fuck are you with that dude?

271
00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.250
- Big dick.

272
00:15:28.954 --> 00:15:31.502
Plus. he can make me cum.

273
00:15:31.502 --> 00:15:34.542
As a high school boy. I think
that's pretty fucking sweet.

274
00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:36.314
- Fucking A. dude.

275
00:15:44.458 --> 00:15:47.111
- I like need another drink.

276
00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:48.442
- You what?

277
00:15:48.442 --> 00:15:50.202
- I said. "I like need another drink."

278
00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:51.531
- You would like something
similar to a drink.

279
00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:54.903
or you like. need another drink?

280
00:15:54.903 --> 00:15:57.143
- What?
- You heard what I say.

281
00:15:57.143 --> 00:15:58.093
- Yeah. but I don't get it.

282
00:15:58.093 --> 00:15:59.543
You just said the same thing.

283
00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:02.013
- Sorta. it's just confusing
because of the like.

284
00:16:02.013 --> 00:16:04.343
Like where you put the
like in the emphasis

285
00:16:04.343 --> 00:16:06.286
on like can change what
you're trying to say.

286
00:16:06.286 --> 00:16:08.042
Like if you said it was raining

287
00:16:08.042 --> 00:16:13.042
like cats and dogs or it's
raining like cats and dogs.

288
00:16:15.431 --> 00:16:16.842
See the difference?

289
00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:17.962
It's the same sentence.

290
00:16:17.962 --> 00:16:19.173
but if I were to take
your meaning of like.

291
00:16:19.173 --> 00:16:21.922
I could actually think it
was raining domestic pets.

292
00:16:21.922 --> 00:16:22.834
- So what?

293
00:16:22.834 --> 00:16:25.762
- I'm just saying like
use like. like properly.

294
00:16:25.762 --> 00:16:27.794
- Like why do you care?

295
00:16:27.794 --> 00:16:29.302
- I don't understand
why we need to use like

296
00:16:29.302 --> 00:16:30.342
in every sentence.

297
00:16:30.342 --> 00:16:32.623
Basically every other word.
and put it on the listener

298
00:16:32.623 --> 00:16:33.583
to figure out what the person

299
00:16:33.583 --> 00:16:36.074
who's doing the liking is trying to say.

300
00:16:36.074 --> 00:16:37.282
- You're an asshole.

301
00:16:37.282 --> 00:16:39.468
- Makes our generation look stupid.

302
00:16:39.468 --> 00:16:42.962
- Okay. you're basing our
entire generation's intelligence

303
00:16:42.962 --> 00:16:45.673
on using one word too much in a sentence.

304
00:16:45.673 --> 00:16:46.674
- Yeah.

305
00:16:46.674 --> 00:16:49.493
- Okay. you're an even bigger
asshole than I thought.

306
00:16:49.493 --> 00:16:51.641
- An asshole. sometimes.

307
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.801
touched for the first time

308
00:18:15.321 --> 00:18:17.580
- Weirdest one is gonna
be John Lennon killed

309
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.309
by Stephen King.

310
00:18:19.309 --> 00:18:20.289
Here we go.

311
00:18:20.289 --> 00:18:21.122
What?

312
00:18:21.122 --> 00:18:22.140
- Stephen who?

313
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.625
- Oh. come on. you know.
crazy clowns. big spiders.

314
00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:27.458
- Carrie.

315
00:18:27.458 --> 00:18:29.197
- Yeah. that movie with
the kick ass chick.

316
00:18:29.197 --> 00:18:30.379
- Okay. she's hot.

317
00:18:30.379 --> 00:18:31.212
- Is she?

318
00:18:31.212 --> 00:18:32.045
- I mean like kinda.

319
00:18:33.037 --> 00:18:34.699
- Okay. okay. what is like
everyone favorite movie

320
00:18:34.699 --> 00:18:35.597
of all time?

321
00:18:35.597 --> 00:18:38.930
- Oh. probably something like Star Wars.

322
00:18:40.094 --> 00:18:42.606
or like Shawshank Redemption
or something like that.

323
00:18:42.606 --> 00:18:47.606
- Exactly. Shawshank based
on a story by Stephen King.

324
00:18:47.685 --> 00:18:51.536
- Oh. so he's like a
Nicholas Sparks type thing.

325
00:18:51.536 --> 00:18:53.453
- Yeah. just like that.

326
00:18:57.158 --> 00:18:57.991
- Come on. man.

327
00:18:57.991 --> 00:18:59.204
What the shit is this?

328
00:18:59.204 --> 00:19:00.404
I wanna get back to the party.

329
00:19:00.404 --> 00:19:01.487
- Hey. man.

330
00:19:01.487 --> 00:19:03.097
What the fuck is going on?

331
00:19:03.097 --> 00:19:05.408
- What do you mean?

332
00:19:05.408 --> 00:19:07.178
- You don't know these people.

333
00:19:07.178 --> 00:19:08.342
- So?

334
00:19:08.342 --> 00:19:09.542
We're having a good time.

335
00:19:09.542 --> 00:19:10.375
You should too. man.

336
00:19:10.375 --> 00:19:11.208
- Travis--

337
00:19:11.208 --> 00:19:12.041
- This party's awesome.

338
00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:13.732
- It's stupid.

339
00:19:13.732 --> 00:19:14.715
You really wanted to have a party

340
00:19:14.715 --> 00:19:16.494
with these people this much?

341
00:19:16.494 --> 00:19:17.327
Yeah.

342
00:19:17.327 --> 00:19:18.324
- Well it's lame.

343
00:19:18.324 --> 00:19:21.763
- Okay. I heard this crazy
theory about the no planes.

344
00:19:21.763 --> 00:19:23.854
- Ah. that's a weird one.

345
00:19:23.854 --> 00:19:26.144
People that think that
there are no plants involved

346
00:19:26.144 --> 00:19:30.624
in 9/11. like it was drones
and planes were put in

347
00:19:30.624 --> 00:19:32.883
with special effects after the fact.

348
00:19:32.883 --> 00:19:35.075
- Come on. that's fucking nuts.

349
00:19:35.075 --> 00:19:37.383
- All right. moon isn't real.

350
00:19:37.383 --> 00:19:40.549
It's actually a large
hologram. emitting rays

351
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:42.874
that keeps our brain running 10%.

352
00:19:42.874 --> 00:19:45.464
which makes human race be more opt

353
00:19:45.464 --> 00:19:47.738
to be stupid and slave-like.

354
00:19:47.738 --> 00:19:50.448
- There's no way people believe that shit.

355
00:19:50.448 --> 00:19:51.798
- David Icke. man.

356
00:19:51.798 --> 00:19:53.894
Crazy English motherfucker.

357
00:19:53.894 --> 00:19:57.944
who went nuts on TV in the
90s and said he was Jesus.

358
00:19:57.944 --> 00:20:02.583
He's the guy who's the huge
reptilian alien advocator.

359
00:20:02.583 --> 00:20:04.822
Dude has tons of followers.

360
00:20:04.822 --> 00:20:07.384
- How do you explain
the moon landing then?

361
00:20:07.384 --> 00:20:08.884
- Stanley Kubrick.

362
00:20:15.354 --> 00:20:17.585
- Don't ruin this.

363
00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:19.585
This is important to me.

364
00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:23.038
It's the most important thing.

365
00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:45.141
No. keep them off.

366
00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:24.354
- Where's Jenny?

367
00:21:24.354 --> 00:21:26.354
- I saw her go upstairs.

368
00:21:27.485 --> 00:21:28.515
- You saw them?

369
00:21:28.515 --> 00:21:29.824
Awhile ago.

370
00:21:29.824 --> 00:21:30.833
- You sure they went up there?

371
00:21:57.465 --> 00:21:59.525
- What are you guys doing up here?

372
00:21:59.525 --> 00:22:01.814
- Oh. you know. just
having a little alone time.

373
00:22:01.814 --> 00:22:03.834
- I'm fucking asking you a question.

374
00:22:03.834 --> 00:22:07.054
This is my house and my party.

375
00:22:07.054 --> 00:22:09.904
- Dude. relax. it's fine.

376
00:22:09.904 --> 00:22:11.915
- Don't tell me to relax.

377
00:22:11.915 --> 00:22:16.748
This is my house. my party. I
make the fucking rules here.

378
00:22:18.763 --> 00:22:22.144
- We were just trynna have
some fun. you know. no biggie.

379
00:22:22.144 --> 00:22:25.227
- No. it is a fucking big deal. okay?

380
00:22:27.485 --> 00:22:31.485
Nobody. and I mean nobody.
can go upstairs ever.

381
00:22:32.403 --> 00:22:36.395
Fucking never. everyone stay down here.

382
00:22:36.395 --> 00:22:38.312
I'm not fucking around.

383
00:22:41.553 --> 00:22:44.321
Let's just all have a
good time. all right?

384
00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:08.144
- What was all that about?

385
00:23:08.144 --> 00:23:09.145
- What. that?

386
00:23:09.145 --> 00:23:11.186
Nothing. man. it's all good.

387
00:23:11.186 --> 00:23:12.437
- Obviously not.

388
00:23:12.437 --> 00:23:13.737
- Oh. no. it is.

389
00:23:13.737 --> 00:23:14.978
I'm fine.

390
00:23:14.978 --> 00:23:16.208
Let's do a shot or something.

391
00:23:16.208 --> 00:23:19.016
- Dude. what is going on?

392
00:23:19.016 --> 00:23:22.260
There's some weird shit going on here.

393
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.672
- What's up. fucktards?

394
00:23:23.672 --> 00:23:25.445
- Dude. did just hook up with Jenny again?

395
00:23:26.787 --> 00:23:28.834
Didn't you just do it like an hour ago?

396
00:23:28.834 --> 00:23:29.667
- Yeah.

397
00:23:29.667 --> 00:23:31.795
Oh. that's awesome.

398
00:23:31.795 --> 00:23:33.736
- You always gotta go for round two. bro.

399
00:23:33.736 --> 00:23:34.696
Second time you last longer.

400
00:23:34.696 --> 00:23:35.946
What?

401
00:23:39.316 --> 00:23:41.267
- Look. everybody's gotta
be good at something. right?

402
00:23:41.267 --> 00:23:42.368
- Yeah.

403
00:23:42.368 --> 00:23:44.227
- All right. well. I don't
really understand a whole lot

404
00:23:44.227 --> 00:23:47.157
about that school crap or any
of the shit you guys are into.

405
00:23:47.157 --> 00:23:50.004
But what I do understand is girls.

406
00:23:50.004 --> 00:23:52.504
- Oh. teach us. wise sex Yoda.

407
00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:55.099
- Jesus Christ.

408
00:23:58.187 --> 00:24:00.045
What room is this?

409
00:24:00.045 --> 00:24:01.916
- Doesn't matter.

410
00:24:18.594 --> 00:24:20.914
- Your shirt. no idea
what it fucking means.

411
00:24:20.914 --> 00:24:23.944
but Jenny. girls. them I understand.

412
00:24:23.944 --> 00:24:26.354
She came to our school.
what. beginning of the year.

413
00:24:26.354 --> 00:24:28.407
and we were hooking up two weeks later.

414
00:24:28.407 --> 00:24:30.081
It's not that complicated.

415
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:32.000
- Well. I think Prometheus
makes more sense

416
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.383
to me than vaginas.

417
00:24:33.383 --> 00:24:36.196
- No. no. no. see that's the thing.

418
00:24:36.196 --> 00:24:38.008
Vaginas aren't that complicated at all.

419
00:24:38.008 --> 00:24:38.933
Girls just want you to think that

420
00:24:38.933 --> 00:24:40.613
so that they can keep all the power.

421
00:24:40.613 --> 00:24:43.216
They're just like dicks. vaginas
are all basically the same.

422
00:24:43.216 --> 00:24:44.376
- Oh. shut up man.

423
00:24:44.376 --> 00:24:45.874
- I'm serious. dude.

424
00:24:45.874 --> 00:24:48.374
Look. how much porn you watch?

425
00:24:49.794 --> 00:24:51.906
- Like. I mean a lot.

426
00:24:53.626 --> 00:24:55.496
- All right. no. see that's the thing.

427
00:24:55.496 --> 00:24:57.688
Everything you need to
know. at least physically.

428
00:24:57.688 --> 00:24:59.133
you can essentially get from porn.

429
00:24:59.133 --> 00:25:00.136
What'd you mean?

430
00:25:00.136 --> 00:25:01.517
- Just try and remember this. okay.

431
00:25:01.517 --> 00:25:03.160
The clit is up here. okay.

432
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.159
It's like a little dick.

433
00:25:04.159 --> 00:25:06.826
- Dude.
- Come on. a little dick?

434
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:23.958
- Listen. you wanna
make Kristen cum. right?

435
00:25:23.958 --> 00:25:25.867
All right. all you gotta know is

436
00:25:25.867 --> 00:25:28.431
that it's clit stimulation
and rhythm. 'kay?

437
00:25:28.431 --> 00:25:29.736
Not to mention paying attention.

438
00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:31.547
Every girl likes things
a little bit differently.

439
00:25:31.547 --> 00:25:34.623
but the most important part
is paying attention. 'kay?

440
00:25:34.623 --> 00:25:35.723
There are signs.

441
00:25:35.723 --> 00:25:36.696
- Like what?

442
00:25:36.696 --> 00:25:38.568
- When you hit the right
spot. look for the sheet grab.

443
00:25:38.568 --> 00:25:40.576
Listen to her breathing. feel her thighs.

444
00:25:40.576 --> 00:25:43.243
This isn't rocket science. boys.

445
00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:00.691
- I've tried some shit.

446
00:26:00.691 --> 00:26:02.524
I still think she fakes it.

447
00:26:02.524 --> 00:26:04.855
- Well. why do you think Jenny
is into a guy like me anyway?

448
00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:05.825
Right?

449
00:26:05.825 --> 00:26:07.604
Is it because I'm so fucking smart.

450
00:26:07.604 --> 00:26:08.884
'cause I stimulate her mind?

451
00:26:08.884 --> 00:26:11.754
No. I got decent sized car.
we have sex all the time.

452
00:26:11.754 --> 00:26:13.025
and I make her cum.

453
00:26:13.025 --> 00:26:13.858
That's it.

454
00:26:14.724 --> 00:26:15.924
- Holy shit. man.

455
00:26:15.924 --> 00:26:17.684
I mean. that makes a lot of sense.

456
00:26:17.684 --> 00:26:19.636
- You know what. I'm
gonna leave you to that.

457
00:26:19.636 --> 00:26:21.120
You guys are hopeless.

458
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.613
I'm gonna get another drink
and stay away from Travis.

459
00:26:23.613 --> 00:26:25.613
That guy's nucking futs.

460
00:26:27.396 --> 00:26:28.762
- Well. I thought it was smart. you know?

461
00:26:28.762 --> 00:26:32.836
- Oh. holy fuck. man. I need to get laid.

462
00:26:32.836 --> 00:26:33.864
- I'm your best friend.

463
00:26:33.864 --> 00:26:35.204
You can tell me.

464
00:26:35.204 --> 00:26:37.244
- What'd you mean?

465
00:26:37.244 --> 00:26:39.213
- The fucking cars in the driveway.

466
00:26:39.213 --> 00:26:42.014
the broken stuff over there.

467
00:26:42.014 --> 00:26:44.322
- I already said my parents
flew to Florida for the weekend.

468
00:26:44.322 --> 00:26:45.739
- I know. I know.

469
00:26:47.093 --> 00:26:49.402
And why do you have all that
shit all over your stomach?

470
00:26:49.402 --> 00:26:50.680
What?

471
00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.513
You know what I'm talking about.

472
00:26:51.513 --> 00:26:54.773
- No. no. no. this it's nothing.

473
00:26:54.773 --> 00:26:56.482
Everything is fine. man.

474
00:26:56.482 --> 00:26:58.528
It's more than fine.

475
00:26:58.528 --> 00:27:00.304
This party fucking rules. huh?

476
00:27:00.304 --> 00:27:02.720
you really hold me down

477
00:27:06.322 --> 00:27:08.994
with a quickie by the pool

478
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.482
really sell that shit

479
00:27:54.692 --> 00:27:56.982
you really hold me down

480
00:27:56.982 --> 00:27:58.982
I'll be your best friend

481
00:28:00.662 --> 00:28:03.678
with a quickie by the pool

482
00:28:15.176 --> 00:28:16.009
- Exactly.

483
00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:17.872
- Okay. hold on.

484
00:28:17.872 --> 00:28:19.941
You're telling me that
if you could have voted.

485
00:28:19.941 --> 00:28:21.971
you would've voted for him.

486
00:28:21.971 --> 00:28:24.971
- To be honest. I don't really know.

487
00:28:25.864 --> 00:28:28.016
- Well. you're obviously fucking crazy.

488
00:28:28.016 --> 00:28:29.040
- What you gonna move to Canada

489
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.120
like Lena Dunham or something?

490
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:31.953
Nope.

491
00:28:31.953 --> 00:28:35.536
- And neither is she.
but maybe she should.

492
00:28:37.876 --> 00:28:40.821
- Travis is acting kinda
weird tonight though. right?

493
00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:44.856
- Look. Travis acting weird isn't weird.

494
00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:48.569
- Just saying he's got
some strange proclivities.

495
00:28:48.569 --> 00:28:50.069
- Proclivities?

496
00:28:50.069 --> 00:28:51.578
- Habits.

497
00:28:51.578 --> 00:28:54.432
- I know what the word means.

498
00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:58.182
- Oh. you just didn't
think I would. asshole.

499
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.395
Hey. man. do you mind?

500
00:29:21.395 --> 00:29:23.205
- Yeah. sure.

501
00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:40.720
What is that?

502
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.303
What?

503
00:29:42.303 --> 00:29:43.381
That.

504
00:29:43.381 --> 00:29:45.701
- I don't know. man.

505
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:47.981
Think it's Jenny's shirt.

506
00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:50.178
- Looks like blood or something.

507
00:29:50.178 --> 00:29:53.688
- Yeah. well. do you think she's
on her period or something.

508
00:29:53.688 --> 00:29:55.228
- What? No.

509
00:29:55.228 --> 00:29:56.531
Why would it be on her shirt?

510
00:29:56.531 --> 00:30:00.771
- Yeah. well they won't
make any sense. unless--

511
00:30:00.771 --> 00:30:03.032
- Something happened. Scully.

512
00:30:03.032 --> 00:30:05.196
- Yo. man. Scully's the girl.

513
00:30:05.196 --> 00:30:07.792
If anything I'm like Fox Mulder.

514
00:30:17.714 --> 00:30:20.087
Is that my shirt?

515
00:30:20.087 --> 00:30:23.236
My shirt. I think you have it.

516
00:30:23.236 --> 00:30:24.736
- Oh. yeah. sorry.

517
00:30:27.151 --> 00:30:31.666
I think you got a stain
or something on there.

518
00:30:31.666 --> 00:30:33.166
- Oh. God damn it.

519
00:30:34.905 --> 00:30:36.145
Look at this shit.

520
00:30:36.145 --> 00:30:37.155
- The fuck is that?

521
00:30:53.595 --> 00:30:56.845
- So party's actually pretty cool. huh?

522
00:30:58.459 --> 00:31:00.459
- Yeah. yeah. it's fine.

523
00:31:02.546 --> 00:31:07.296
- Look I know I can kinda seem
like an asshole sometimes.

524
00:31:10.425 --> 00:31:12.882
I just. you know that makes it harder

525
00:31:12.882 --> 00:31:15.382
to come out and say this shit.

526
00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:19.564
but I really like you.

527
00:31:21.586 --> 00:31:23.919
- Yeah. I like you too much.

528
00:31:25.004 --> 00:31:27.804
- Well. no. but I'm serious.

529
00:31:27.804 --> 00:31:30.387
Like I really fucking like you.

530
00:31:38.516 --> 00:31:40.895
- You're just drunk or something. Mitch.

531
00:31:40.895 --> 00:31:43.535
Now is not the time for this conversation.

532
00:31:43.535 --> 00:31:44.604
- Why not?

533
00:31:44.604 --> 00:31:46.495
Why the fuck not?

534
00:31:46.495 --> 00:31:49.906
- This fucking stuff won't come out.

535
00:31:49.906 --> 00:31:51.574
- Why can't you even talk to me?

536
00:31:51.574 --> 00:31:55.324
I mean. I'm trying really
hard here. I just--

537
00:31:56.849 --> 00:31:58.700
- I know honey. and it's sweet.

538
00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.634
It really is.

539
00:31:59.634 --> 00:32:01.683
It's just. let's not do this

540
00:32:01.683 --> 00:32:04.850
in Travis Turner's laundry room. okay?

541
00:32:06.863 --> 00:32:09.599
- Didn't even say it back.

542
00:32:09.599 --> 00:32:10.991
- Yes. I did.

543
00:32:10.991 --> 00:32:12.074
- Not really.

544
00:32:12.975 --> 00:32:17.199
I mean. you can't even
seem to look at me like--

545
00:32:17.199 --> 00:32:19.236
- You like what we have. right?

546
00:32:19.236 --> 00:32:23.287
We have fun. we fuck.
you make me feel good.

547
00:32:23.287 --> 00:32:25.447
and I make you feel good.

548
00:32:25.447 --> 00:32:27.030
We're 17 years old.

549
00:32:28.087 --> 00:32:30.706
We couldn't hope for
anything more than this.

550
00:32:30.706 --> 00:32:34.289
I mean. even this is
so rare anymore. okay?

551
00:32:37.083 --> 00:32:40.416
Let's just enjoy what we have right now.

552
00:32:41.267 --> 00:32:42.604
- But what about when we have to--

553
00:32:42.604 --> 00:32:44.334
- It doesn't matter.

554
00:32:44.334 --> 00:32:45.758
If we have this conversation now.

555
00:32:45.758 --> 00:32:48.598
it's gonna ruin everything.

556
00:32:48.598 --> 00:32:51.657
Just don't fucking ruin it. okay?

557
00:32:51.657 --> 00:32:53.407
We have a good thing.

558
00:33:00.507 --> 00:33:02.257
We have a good thing.

559
00:33:06.457 --> 00:33:07.707
- Right. right.

560
00:35:40.602 --> 00:35:45.563
- Dude. tell me what the fuck
is going on with you tonight.

561
00:35:45.563 --> 00:35:46.974
- I don't know. man.

562
00:35:46.974 --> 00:35:49.562
I wanted to have a party.
so I threw a party.

563
00:35:49.562 --> 00:35:50.960
- Yeah. but with your parents.

564
00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.493
- This party though. right?

565
00:35:52.493 --> 00:35:55.389
- Listen. man. I don't wanna be a downer.

566
00:35:55.389 --> 00:35:56.893
There's some weird shit happen--

567
00:35:56.893 --> 00:35:59.167
- Don't bring that up now. dude.

568
00:35:59.167 --> 00:36:01.407
I just want to enjoy this night.

569
00:36:01.407 --> 00:36:04.298
and deal with everything else later.

570
00:36:04.298 --> 00:36:07.566
It's the everything else that scares me.

571
00:36:07.566 --> 00:36:09.658
We are seniors. man.

572
00:36:09.658 --> 00:36:13.719
We got a few months of this
fucking depressing high school

573
00:36:13.719 --> 00:36:16.159
and lame ass town to get through.

574
00:36:16.159 --> 00:36:18.359
And then that's it.

575
00:36:18.359 --> 00:36:21.859
All I wanted was to have one fucking night

576
00:36:23.165 --> 00:36:25.405
where it was about me.

577
00:36:25.405 --> 00:36:28.359
I was the one who threw
the wicked ass party.

578
00:36:28.359 --> 00:36:31.198
I wanted to be the one on
Monday where people said.

579
00:36:31.198 --> 00:36:32.727
"Were you at Travis's?

580
00:36:32.727 --> 00:36:34.858
"Oh shit. it was crazy."

581
00:36:34.858 --> 00:36:38.378
Where it didn't matter
how shitty my life was.

582
00:36:38.378 --> 00:36:40.461
or that I wasn't popular.

583
00:36:41.325 --> 00:36:42.908
or how happy I was.

584
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:47.738
or my fucking retarded parents nagging me.

585
00:36:47.738 --> 00:36:49.869
None of that bullshit.

586
00:36:49.869 --> 00:36:52.039
Just a good party.

587
00:36:52.039 --> 00:36:53.372
It was all mine.

588
00:36:54.782 --> 00:36:56.115
That's it. dude.

589
00:36:56.989 --> 00:36:59.789
Is that too much to fucking ask?

590
00:36:59.789 --> 00:37:01.706
- The short answer. no.

591
00:37:03.069 --> 00:37:05.149
- Well then what is there to talk about?

592
00:37:05.149 --> 00:37:08.896
I fucking made it happen.
and it is awesome.

593
00:37:08.896 --> 00:37:11.279
You see those people in there?

594
00:37:11.279 --> 00:37:13.178
- They're only stoked
because you had a place

595
00:37:13.178 --> 00:37:15.598
with free beer on a Friday night.

596
00:37:15.598 --> 00:37:17.579
- You don't get it.

597
00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:19.350
That doesn't matter.

598
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.183
I don't care if that's the reason.

599
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.990
At least they came. and it was me. all me.

600
00:37:29.151 --> 00:37:30.068
I did this.

601
00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:35.322
- No. I get it man. I do.

602
00:37:40.076 --> 00:37:42.993
All right. You know Martin Shkreli?

603
00:37:44.559 --> 00:37:45.392
- The AIDS guy?

604
00:37:45.392 --> 00:37:46.261
- Yeah.

605
00:37:46.261 --> 00:37:47.878
- Didn't he jack up the price on the--

606
00:37:47.878 --> 00:37:49.279
- That's the one. yeah.

607
00:37:49.279 --> 00:37:50.181
- Fuck that dick sack.

608
00:37:50.181 --> 00:37:51.551
- Okay. see.

609
00:37:51.551 --> 00:37:54.890
What people don't know is
there's a reason why he did that.

610
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:58.286
- 'cause he's a money hungry homo hater.

611
00:37:58.286 --> 00:37:59.369
- Well. yeah.

612
00:38:00.527 --> 00:38:03.767
But it's much more complicated than that.

613
00:38:03.767 --> 00:38:06.758
He realized that his product was inferior

614
00:38:06.758 --> 00:38:09.416
to the other medication on the market.

615
00:38:09.416 --> 00:38:11.647
And he wanted to raise money
to make his product better.

616
00:38:11.647 --> 00:38:12.965
and really to deter people

617
00:38:12.965 --> 00:38:15.718
from buying his less
than stellar medication

618
00:38:15.718 --> 00:38:19.458
to other products. which are better.

619
00:38:19.458 --> 00:38:23.967
- Hold on. are you fucking
defending this douche canoe?

620
00:38:23.967 --> 00:38:25.884
- Yeah. I guess. kinda.

621
00:38:27.967 --> 00:38:32.967
What I'm saying is is that
there's always two sides.

622
00:38:33.007 --> 00:38:36.607
Those people in there.
they see you as one way.

623
00:38:36.607 --> 00:38:41.107
like the weird kid is throwing
a party. and that's it.

624
00:38:42.588 --> 00:38:46.045
But I know it's not just that simple.

625
00:38:46.045 --> 00:38:47.730
There's something more happening.

626
00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:49.949
and it's not what everyone thinks it is.

627
00:39:10.165 --> 00:39:12.919
Something's happening tonight.

628
00:39:12.919 --> 00:39:15.669
Like. I mean. tonight felt weird.

629
00:39:17.078 --> 00:39:18.418
- I don't know. man.

630
00:39:18.418 --> 00:39:20.799
I just think Travis is a weird kid.

631
00:39:20.799 --> 00:39:23.318
Okay. and
what about the shirt?

632
00:39:23.318 --> 00:39:25.407
- Okay. so Jenny has
something on her shirt.

633
00:39:25.407 --> 00:39:27.078
Big fucking whoop.

634
00:39:27.078 --> 00:39:28.959
- The cars you see on the driveway?

635
00:39:28.959 --> 00:39:30.789
- His parents could just
be out for the night.

636
00:39:30.789 --> 00:39:32.372
- Okay. okay. sure.

637
00:39:33.269 --> 00:39:35.782
What is it with the upstairs?

638
00:39:35.782 --> 00:39:37.917
Why did Travis freaked the fuck out

639
00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:40.746
when Mitch and Jenny were up there. huh?

640
00:39:40.746 --> 00:39:42.337
- Yeah. that was weird.

641
00:39:42.337 --> 00:39:43.170
- Yeah.

642
00:39:44.138 --> 00:39:46.666
- So what does this all mean then?

643
00:39:46.666 --> 00:39:48.793
- I don't know. man.

644
00:39:48.793 --> 00:39:52.912
I'm pretty sure that was
blood on Jenny's shirt.

645
00:39:52.912 --> 00:39:56.617
- Maybe Travis is gonna like
start a cult or something.

646
00:39:56.617 --> 00:39:58.857
and all the beer has been laced with shit.

647
00:39:58.857 --> 00:40:00.207
and everything we've been saying

648
00:40:00.207 --> 00:40:02.537
and doing is just some
crazy hallucination.

649
00:40:02.537 --> 00:40:05.185
and really it's Travis
way of converting us

650
00:40:05.185 --> 00:40:07.407
into some Charles Manson type thing.

651
00:40:07.407 --> 00:40:11.606
where he gets us to murder
celebrities and shit.

652
00:40:11.606 --> 00:40:13.251
- Fuck. dude.

653
00:40:13.251 --> 00:40:15.030
That's insane.

654
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.108
I think
it's weirder than that.

655
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.801
- I'm not some fucking stranger.

656
00:40:39.801 --> 00:40:41.219
I know you.

657
00:40:41.219 --> 00:40:42.380
- I know that.

658
00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.130
- Okay. so then what?

659
00:40:45.194 --> 00:40:47.567
Your fucking parents are
hard on you. so what?

660
00:40:47.567 --> 00:40:49.754
At least they care.

661
00:40:49.754 --> 00:40:52.230
You know what I have to go
through every day being what I am

662
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.791
in this place. going to school?

663
00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:54.624
- Oh. here it comes.

664
00:40:54.624 --> 00:40:55.652
The fucking sob story.

665
00:40:55.652 --> 00:40:58.662
- It's not. man. it's fucking reality.

666
00:40:58.662 --> 00:41:01.353
I mean. you are a straight white dude

667
00:41:01.353 --> 00:41:02.793
with two parents that love you enough

668
00:41:02.793 --> 00:41:06.423
to care about what you do with your life.

669
00:41:06.423 --> 00:41:08.064
My parents?

670
00:41:08.064 --> 00:41:11.303
I mean. my dad. who knows
where that fucktard is.

671
00:41:11.303 --> 00:41:13.543
And my mom's so in denial about me.

672
00:41:13.543 --> 00:41:16.960
she pretends I'm still a normal teenager.

673
00:41:18.593 --> 00:41:21.156
Not a sob story. man.

674
00:41:21.156 --> 00:41:22.656
It's just reality.

675
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:25.372
Just because you don't
have any real struggles.

676
00:41:25.372 --> 00:41:28.711
doesn't mean you should
just blow up the small shit.

677
00:41:28.711 --> 00:41:30.383
Shit. man. even with all my shit.

678
00:41:30.383 --> 00:41:32.716
I still have it pretty good.

679
00:41:33.652 --> 00:41:35.128
You know how many countries would kill me

680
00:41:35.128 --> 00:41:36.878
because of what I am?

681
00:41:42.838 --> 00:41:45.890
- They were going to send me away.

682
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:46.964
- What?

683
00:41:46.964 --> 00:41:51.018
- Yeah. it's like a
rehab thing or some shit.

684
00:41:51.018 --> 00:41:53.601
They were going to ship me off.

685
00:41:54.876 --> 00:41:56.335
- Well. maybe that'd be good.

686
00:41:56.335 --> 00:41:58.255
- Fucking no. dude.

687
00:41:58.255 --> 00:41:59.755
I want to be here.

688
00:42:01.235 --> 00:42:03.796
So what. I do some drugs.

689
00:42:03.796 --> 00:42:05.127
Sometimes I feel like dying.

690
00:42:05.127 --> 00:42:07.544
but what fucking kid doesn't?

691
00:42:08.847 --> 00:42:10.676
- I think it's more than just that. man.

692
00:42:10.676 --> 00:42:12.759
- Oh. fuck. not you. too.

693
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.996
I don't need help.

694
00:42:15.996 --> 00:42:20.996
I just wanna finish school.
and get the fuck outta here.

695
00:42:21.148 --> 00:42:23.981
Well. and have a party. of course.

696
00:42:24.938 --> 00:42:26.021
- Wait. were?

697
00:42:28.094 --> 00:42:28.927
- What?

698
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:32.628
- You said. "were."

699
00:42:32.628 --> 00:42:35.128
They were gonna send you away.

700
00:42:36.074 --> 00:42:36.907
- Yeah.

701
00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:40.746
And now they aren't.

702
00:42:45.748 --> 00:42:47.248
- And why is that?

703
00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:54.894
I'm not an idiot. man.

704
00:42:54.894 --> 00:42:58.561
Your parents' car's in
the fucking driveway.

705
00:43:02.258 --> 00:43:05.008
They aren't in Florida. are they?

706
00:43:10.039 --> 00:43:12.706
So where the fuck are they then?

707
00:43:16.885 --> 00:43:17.802
- Upstairs.

708
00:43:22.018 --> 00:43:23.685
- Like in the house?

709
00:43:38.989 --> 00:43:41.290
- He just doesn't take me seriously.

710
00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.400
He thinks I'm stupid.

711
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.340
- I'm sure that's not true.

712
00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.935
- You saw how he was out there.

713
00:43:47.935 --> 00:43:51.949
- Guys are more emotionally
stupid in front of other guys.

714
00:43:51.949 --> 00:43:55.290
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

715
00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:57.540
- Maybe I'm just too drunk.

716
00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:02.091
It's his stupid. cute face.

717
00:44:05.042 --> 00:44:09.375
I just wanna slap him and
kiss him at the same time.

718
00:44:11.403 --> 00:44:13.153
- Yeah. I can relate.

719
00:44:15.602 --> 00:44:17.019
Just talk to him.

720
00:44:20.023 --> 00:44:22.162
- Yeah. I mean you're right.

721
00:44:30.018 --> 00:44:31.551
- You talking to me now?

722
00:44:31.551 --> 00:44:32.384
- Shut up.

723
00:44:33.369 --> 00:44:35.609
Let's just get out of here.

724
00:44:35.609 --> 00:44:38.409
- I kind of want to stay
until they get back.

725
00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:42.060
- Yeah. I wanna see how
this whole thing plays out.

726
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.449
- I got a theory.

727
00:44:43.449 --> 00:44:45.087
- Let's hear it.

728
00:44:45.087 --> 00:44:48.087
- Okay. so we've got a bloody shirt.

729
00:44:48.982 --> 00:44:51.129
cars are still in the driveway.

730
00:44:51.129 --> 00:44:52.940
Travis is being all weird.

731
00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:54.089
- Yeah.

732
00:44:54.089 --> 00:44:55.672
- So what if. okay.

733
00:44:59.156 --> 00:45:01.823
what if Travis took his parents.

734
00:45:03.441 --> 00:45:05.441
and like locked them up.

735
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:10.993
so he can actually control the house.

736
00:45:11.972 --> 00:45:14.809
and let his parents out as a cover.

737
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:17.226
but really he runs the house.

738
00:45:18.359 --> 00:45:21.980
and keeps them chained up and locked away.

739
00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.675
so he can do crazy shit.

740
00:45:24.675 --> 00:45:27.758
And maybe they're upstairs right now.

741
00:45:30.788 --> 00:45:33.288
Rabid. hungry. and chained up.

742
00:45:36.308 --> 00:45:40.134
- You've watched too many
fucking movies. dude.

743
00:45:40.134 --> 00:45:40.967
- Maybe.

744
00:45:44.477 --> 00:45:46.279
- We're the only ones left.

745
00:45:46.279 --> 00:45:48.989
You guys sure you wanna stay?

746
00:45:48.989 --> 00:45:49.822
- Yeah.

747
00:45:58.210 --> 00:45:59.966
- And the marks on your body.

748
00:45:59.966 --> 00:46:01.515
the fucking broken shit in the house.

749
00:46:01.515 --> 00:46:02.932
the bloody shirt.

750
00:46:04.896 --> 00:46:07.275
- I just wanted a party. man.

751
00:46:07.275 --> 00:46:08.108
One night.

752
00:46:10.289 --> 00:46:11.662
They took my phone.

753
00:46:11.662 --> 00:46:12.942
they took my drugs.

754
00:46:12.942 --> 00:46:15.275
I couldn't do anything. man.

755
00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:19.789
They were gonna send me away.

756
00:46:19.789 --> 00:46:20.891
Fucking away. man.

757
00:46:20.891 --> 00:46:22.742
- So then what?

758
00:46:22.742 --> 00:46:24.861
- You already know. man.

759
00:46:24.861 --> 00:46:25.910
You already know.

760
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:27.302
- No. I don't. dude.

761
00:46:27.302 --> 00:46:29.661
I don't fucking know.

762
00:46:29.661 --> 00:46:31.190
Tell me.

763
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:32.411
Say the fucking words.

764
00:46:32.411 --> 00:46:34.651
I wanna hear them from
your God damn mouth.

765
00:46:34.651 --> 00:46:35.984
- Nope. I can't.

766
00:46:37.341 --> 00:46:40.008
- You fucking can. and you will.

767
00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.480
- I killed them both.

768
00:47:01.793 --> 00:47:04.126
- It can't be that bad. man.

769
00:47:05.612 --> 00:47:06.445
- It is.

770
00:47:07.982 --> 00:47:10.482
- I don't fucking believe you.

771
00:47:11.404 --> 00:47:12.702
- Well. it's true.

772
00:47:12.702 --> 00:47:16.382
- Well. I don't believe you. I just don't.

773
00:47:16.382 --> 00:47:19.549
There's no way you could've done that.

774
00:47:24.252 --> 00:47:27.419
- They're upstairs dead. and I did it.

775
00:47:33.852 --> 00:47:36.113
- You are fucked up.

776
00:47:36.113 --> 00:47:39.030
And maybe you need some help. dude.

777
00:47:40.442 --> 00:47:43.453
There's no way you could have done that.

778
00:47:43.453 --> 00:47:45.203
You're a good person.

779
00:47:46.153 --> 00:47:47.403
We are friends.

780
00:47:48.993 --> 00:47:49.910
I know you.

781
00:47:51.382 --> 00:47:53.934
Remember my fifth birthday party?

782
00:47:53.934 --> 00:47:55.913
You got that sweet Return of the Jedi book

783
00:47:55.913 --> 00:47:57.830
with pictures and shit.

784
00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:00.364
You're still that awesome kid.

785
00:48:00.364 --> 00:48:04.334
who'd do anything for his friends. for me.

786
00:48:04.334 --> 00:48:07.533
Broke some kid's nose for me.

787
00:48:07.533 --> 00:48:12.233
I remember thinking this
kid is fucking awesome.

788
00:48:12.233 --> 00:48:14.284
If you'd do that for me
when we're just classmates.

789
00:48:14.284 --> 00:48:16.451
he's gotta be a great guy.

790
00:48:17.782 --> 00:48:19.341
- I don't know. man.

791
00:48:19.341 --> 00:48:23.091
I know it's bad. and I
don't know what to do.

792
00:48:26.023 --> 00:48:30.023
I know I'm fucked. and I
just want to be better.

793
00:48:31.924 --> 00:48:35.134
I don't know how or what to do.

794
00:48:35.134 --> 00:48:37.301
I just want to get better.

795
00:48:39.844 --> 00:48:44.427
I know I'm fucked. and I know
I'm so fucked. and like--

796
00:48:46.132 --> 00:48:47.715
What am I gonna do?

797
00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:53.811
- It's all right. it's all right.

798
00:48:55.342 --> 00:48:57.012
I still don't believe you.

799
00:48:57.012 --> 00:48:58.845
I just really I don't.

800
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:06.628
I see you crying and shit.
but I can't believe you.

801
00:49:06.628 --> 00:49:07.461
I won't.

802
00:49:10.694 --> 00:49:12.194
Not without proof.

803
00:49:15.415 --> 00:49:16.832
- You want proof?

804
00:49:19.455 --> 00:49:21.205
I can show you proof.

805
00:49:26.066 --> 00:49:27.983
- Show them to me then.

806
00:49:29.305 --> 00:49:33.888
I wanna see their bodies when
we get back to the party.

807
00:49:36.567 --> 00:49:37.400
- Okay.

808
00:49:43.516 --> 00:49:44.766
Ben. I'm sorry.

809
00:49:49.079 --> 00:49:49.912
I'm sorry.

810
00:49:57.454 --> 00:49:59.787
- You will get through this.

811
00:50:01.709 --> 00:50:02.959
I promise. man.

812
00:50:04.197 --> 00:50:06.778
It's probably not as bad as you think.

813
00:50:06.778 --> 00:50:07.829
You're all fucked up right now.

814
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:10.579
It's probably not that bad. okay?

815
00:50:11.738 --> 00:50:13.676
Tell me things
are going to be okay.

816
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.277
- I can't do that. man.

817
00:50:19.127 --> 00:50:19.960
- Okay.

818
00:50:26.332 --> 00:50:27.413
- What the hell?

819
00:50:27.413 --> 00:50:28.663
What the fuck. man?

820
00:50:28.663 --> 00:50:29.813
Where is everyone?

821
00:50:29.813 --> 00:50:30.646
Why did they leave?

822
00:50:30.646 --> 00:50:31.479
What the fuck?

823
00:50:31.479 --> 00:50:32.952
- Hey. hey. hey cool it. man.

824
00:50:32.952 --> 00:50:34.602
It's all right.

825
00:50:34.602 --> 00:50:35.442
It's pretty late.

826
00:50:35.442 --> 00:50:36.962
and everyone was pretty
fucked up when we left.

827
00:50:36.962 --> 00:50:37.795
- I don't care.

828
00:50:37.795 --> 00:50:38.903
They shouldn't just leave.

829
00:50:38.903 --> 00:50:39.790
Who does that?

830
00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:41.123
- Hey. upstairs?

831
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:44.954
Lead the way.

832
00:51:30.801 --> 00:51:32.529
- You guys need to go.

833
00:51:32.529 --> 00:51:33.590
- What?

834
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.525
- Yeah. come on man. it's a party.

835
00:51:36.525 --> 00:51:38.097
- Not really anymore.

836
00:51:38.097 --> 00:51:40.597
- Everyone needs to leave now.

837
00:51:41.727 --> 00:51:43.116
- Guys. let's go.

838
00:52:05.543 --> 00:52:08.137
Thanks for the party. Travis.

839
00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:12.618
- Shut up. let's just go.

840
00:52:28.858 --> 00:52:29.691
- What are you doing?

841
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:31.274
- I want a picture.

842
00:52:39.058 --> 00:52:41.058
- I'm like really drunk.

843
00:52:42.936 --> 00:52:44.230
Don't even fucking say it.

844
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:45.063
- I wasn't.

845
00:52:45.063 --> 00:52:46.236
- Yeah. you definitely were.

846
00:52:46.236 --> 00:52:47.069
- Nope.

847
00:52:48.337 --> 00:52:50.417
- You were being an asshole before.

848
00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:51.334
- I wasn't.

849
00:52:53.145 --> 00:52:55.743
- Do you really think I'm stupid?

850
00:52:55.743 --> 00:52:57.423
- I think you're beautiful.

851
00:52:57.423 --> 00:52:58.994
- I'm serious.

852
00:52:58.994 --> 00:53:00.543
- I don't think you're stupid.

853
00:53:00.543 --> 00:53:02.085
I think maybe you're just more complicated

854
00:53:02.085 --> 00:53:03.835
than I maybe thought.

855
00:53:07.134 --> 00:53:08.143
- What's that?

856
00:53:08.143 --> 00:53:09.342
- On my hand?

857
00:53:09.342 --> 00:53:10.175
- Obvi.

858
00:53:11.337 --> 00:53:12.773
- DBC.

859
00:53:12.773 --> 00:53:13.893
- Yeah. I can see that.

860
00:53:13.893 --> 00:53:14.773
What does it mean?

861
00:53:14.773 --> 00:53:16.591
- Don't be cuddly.

862
00:53:16.591 --> 00:53:18.259
- Has that been there the whole night?

863
00:53:18.259 --> 00:53:19.092
- Mhm.

864
00:53:19.092 --> 00:53:20.219
- Why?

865
00:53:20.219 --> 00:53:23.361
- To remind myself not
to be cuddly with anyone.

866
00:53:23.361 --> 00:53:26.294
It is a party. and when I get drunk--

867
00:53:26.294 --> 00:53:29.711
- Okay. I think you're the fucking idiot.

868
00:53:36.649 --> 00:53:37.947
- Let's get back to my place.

869
00:53:37.947 --> 00:53:39.729
I've got some things I wanna try.

870
00:53:39.729 --> 00:53:41.449
- Oh. yes. finally.

871
00:53:48.261 --> 00:53:51.761
You know what I have to do. right?

872
00:53:52.661 --> 00:53:53.494
Travis?

873
00:53:56.371 --> 00:53:59.251
How can you be this calm?

874
00:53:59.251 --> 00:54:01.542
You realize the position you've put me in?

875
00:54:01.542 --> 00:54:02.380
- Hey. man.

876
00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:04.430
I didn't make you play Sherlock
fucking Holmes tonight.

877
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:07.013
Okay. you did that on your own.

878
00:54:09.283 --> 00:54:13.866
- You really don't see how
hard this is for me. do you?

879
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:16.240
You don't care.

880
00:54:18.495 --> 00:54:21.697
- Do what you have to do then.

881
00:54:21.697 --> 00:54:23.447
- Where are you. man?

882
00:54:24.491 --> 00:54:25.970
How can you be on that shit right now?

883
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:29.825
Your fucking parents are dead up there.

884
00:54:29.825 --> 00:54:31.158
- Yes. they are.

885
00:54:37.939 --> 00:54:41.439
- And your best friend has to turn you in.

886
00:54:45.553 --> 00:54:48.220
I have to make the fucking call.

887
00:54:50.502 --> 00:54:52.919
- Do what you think is right.

888
00:54:54.353 --> 00:54:56.593
- You understand when
I walk out that door.

889
00:54:56.593 --> 00:54:58.010
it's over. right?

890
00:55:00.322 --> 00:55:02.822
We don't see each other again.

891
00:55:03.963 --> 00:55:06.251
Take care. man.

892
00:55:06.251 --> 00:55:07.751
Thanks for coming.

893
00:55:26.728 --> 00:55:29.699
- You know. Jenny. I love you--

894
00:55:29.699 --> 00:55:31.190
- Don't say it.

895
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:32.819
You're drunk.

896
00:55:32.819 --> 00:55:36.919
Let's just walk home and
fall asleep together. okay?

897
00:55:36.919 --> 00:55:41.336
- But we should be together
for fucking like forever.

898
00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.528
- If by forever you mean
until the end of this year.

899
00:55:46.528 --> 00:55:48.528
then yes. yes we should.

900
00:55:50.167 --> 00:55:52.250
- You're awesome and hot.

901
00:55:53.725 --> 00:55:54.558
- Thanks.

902
00:55:57.465 --> 00:55:59.288
- Whoa. whoa. wait.

903
00:55:59.288 --> 00:56:01.728
We're still gonna fuck until then. right?

904
00:56:01.728 --> 00:56:02.645
- Uh. yeah.

905
00:56:03.879 --> 00:56:05.510
- Okay. good.

906
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:07.030
I like that part.

907
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.863
- Me. too.

908
00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:31.086
- Wait. don't leave.

909
00:56:35.912 --> 00:56:37.162
I'm not normal.

910
00:56:40.022 --> 00:56:43.605
I'm not like the rest
of these people. man.

911
00:56:45.753 --> 00:56:48.836
I'm fucked up. like really fucked up.

912
00:56:53.814 --> 00:56:56.731
I don't see things. or feel things.

913
00:56:59.862 --> 00:57:04.029
or deal with things the
same way as everyone else.

914
00:57:07.382 --> 00:57:11.715
I actually can't even believe
I even had one friend.

915
00:57:16.742 --> 00:57:19.753
I don't deserve any friends.

916
00:57:19.753 --> 00:57:21.670
Let alone a girlfriend.

917
00:57:25.732 --> 00:57:28.149
I haven't figured myself out.

918
00:57:29.804 --> 00:57:33.804
Haven't figured out how
to deal with being this.

919
00:57:41.003 --> 00:57:41.836
being me.

920
00:57:45.033 --> 00:57:49.783
Until I do. I can't honestly
live any kind of normal life

921
00:57:54.772 --> 00:57:58.189
or be a part of anyone's life in any way.

922
00:58:03.273 --> 00:58:05.106
Maybe being by myself.

923
00:58:07.231 --> 00:58:08.648
away from people.

924
00:58:09.644 --> 00:58:11.144
away from society.

925
00:58:13.384 --> 00:58:15.467
is the best thing for me.

926
00:58:19.404 --> 00:58:20.904
- That's bullshit.

927
00:58:23.462 --> 00:58:26.096
You weren't fucking special.

928
00:58:26.096 --> 00:58:26.929
- Thanks.

929
00:58:28.221 --> 00:58:32.544
- What I mean is that
every kid is fucked up

930
00:58:32.544 --> 00:58:35.211
in some way now. especially now.

931
00:58:36.523 --> 00:58:41.490
Jesus dude. look at the way we
communicate with each other.

932
00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:43.573
what we're obsessed with.

933
00:58:47.838 --> 00:58:50.822
- But you did figure it out.

934
00:58:50.822 --> 00:58:51.655
- Yeah.

935
00:58:54.463 --> 00:58:57.222
But you I think I did that on my own.

936
00:58:57.222 --> 00:58:59.055
without anyone's help?

937
00:59:01.408 --> 00:59:04.184
You aren't any different
than the rest of us.

938
00:59:04.184 --> 00:59:05.267
No different.

939
00:59:07.104 --> 00:59:10.164
And the fact that you
think you need to be alone

940
00:59:10.164 --> 00:59:14.997
or away from society is just
the biggest fucking lie. man.

941
00:59:20.454 --> 00:59:24.371
This shit. this thing.
the communities on here.

942
00:59:25.505 --> 00:59:28.005
it means fucking nothing. man.

943
00:59:29.225 --> 00:59:30.642
It's a quick fix.

944
00:59:33.124 --> 00:59:37.313
The shit on here tells
us that we need to be

945
00:59:37.313 --> 00:59:40.305
at a certain place in our life.

946
00:59:40.305 --> 00:59:44.638
look a certain way to get
a girlfriend or boyfriend.

947
00:59:45.512 --> 00:59:47.179
or have any friends.

948
00:59:50.084 --> 00:59:52.964
And actually thinking that
someday in the future.

949
00:59:52.964 --> 00:59:55.414
you'll be at this place
where everything is better.

950
00:59:55.414 --> 00:59:58.425
and you become this
fantastic version of yourself

951
00:59:58.425 --> 01:00:03.092
to get all those things is
fucking shit. fucking insane.

952
01:00:04.694 --> 01:00:06.194
Stupid shit. dude.

953
01:00:09.944 --> 01:00:13.777
- So what. what's the
big fucking secret then?

954
01:00:16.753 --> 01:00:17.586
- Others.

955
01:00:19.313 --> 01:00:20.146
- What?

956
01:00:21.204 --> 01:00:22.454
- Other people.

957
01:00:23.494 --> 01:00:26.644
Talking to real people.
making real friends.

958
01:00:26.644 --> 01:00:30.311
making real connections.
not this fake shit.

959
01:00:32.264 --> 01:00:36.056
The only way you're gonna feel better

960
01:00:36.056 --> 01:00:38.139
is if you talk to people.

961
01:00:41.412 --> 01:00:42.329
- Like you?

962
01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:45.607
- Yeah. like me.

963
01:00:49.543 --> 01:00:51.543
The only chance you. we.

964
01:00:54.489 --> 01:00:58.239
have is to connect with
the people around us.

965
01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.257
You. Ricky.

966
01:01:04.951 --> 01:01:08.216
talking to other kids that
feel the same way I do.

967
01:01:08.216 --> 01:01:13.049
That's what helped me to become
comfortable with who I am.

968
01:01:22.503 --> 01:01:26.086
- Well. I don't have
that luxury now. do I?

969
01:01:41.538 --> 01:01:43.538
- So I've been thinking.

970
01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.591
like maybe we just accept
that you may never know

971
01:01:48.591 --> 01:01:50.671
what exactly happened tonight.

972
01:01:50.671 --> 01:01:54.271
Okay. maybe.
but that's kind of boring.

973
01:01:54.271 --> 01:01:59.271
- Like maybe just. maybe.
Travis is a weird fucking kid.

974
01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:02.409
who just threw a party to have fun.

975
01:02:02.409 --> 01:02:04.742
and really nothing happened.

976
01:02:05.696 --> 01:02:08.358
- You're always rambling on
about conspiracy theories.

977
01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:10.158
and we can finally have
one here in our town

978
01:02:10.158 --> 01:02:12.528
at a party we were at.

979
01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:14.249
I guess.

980
01:02:14.249 --> 01:02:16.300
Maybe a little mystery is good.

981
01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.924
But it's fun to
talk about though. right?

982
01:02:18.924 --> 01:02:21.007
- I don't know.

983
01:02:21.007 --> 01:02:21.969
He's just weird.

984
01:02:21.969 --> 01:02:25.759
like
right in front of you.

985
01:02:25.759 --> 01:02:30.095
That's actually
a really sound point. Mike.

986
01:02:30.095 --> 01:02:31.678
Wow. I'm surprised.

987
01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:36.105
- Maybe not every story.

988
01:02:36.105 --> 01:02:41.105
not every character used
a  bow tie.

989
01:02:42.702 --> 01:02:44.420
Maybe it's better we'll never know

990
01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.601
what exactly happened tonight.

991
01:02:46.601 --> 01:02:49.241
Eh. you could be right.

992
01:02:49.241 --> 01:02:52.020
- Or maybe. you're too
scared what the truth

993
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.937
of tonight actually is.

994
01:02:59.864 --> 01:03:01.864
So. now what?

995
01:03:04.954 --> 01:03:06.287
- You know what.

996
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:10.012
Have to make the call. I have to.

997
01:03:10.012 --> 01:03:10.845
- Okay.

998
01:03:16.397 --> 01:03:20.064
- Things are gonna be
different from now on.

999
01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:22.000
- I know.

1000
01:03:24.445 --> 01:03:27.945
- This doesn't have to be the end for you.

1001
01:03:28.909 --> 01:03:30.742
but I have to do this.

1002
01:03:32.918 --> 01:03:33.751
- I know.

1003
01:03:35.858 --> 01:03:36.914
- I better go.

1004
01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:38.302
I might never leave.

1005
01:03:38.302 --> 01:03:39.135
- Okay.

1006
01:05:28.511 --> 01:05:33.511
it's what I have left

1007
01:07:22.566 --> 01:07:24.035
Mom and dad.

1008
01:07:24.035 --> 01:07:27.126
I am writing this on
Tuesday. December 15th.

1009
01:07:27.126 --> 01:07:28.791
You guys have grounded me for months

1010
01:07:28.791 --> 01:07:31.252
after the incident
involving my English teacher

1011
01:07:31.252 --> 01:07:33.315
and some drug bullshit.

1012
01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:34.812
I have no phone.

1013
01:07:34.812 --> 01:07:37.678
I can't talk to anyone outside of school.

1014
01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:41.051
I sit here in this fucking
house day after day.

1015
01:07:41.051 --> 01:07:43.623
hating you both more and more.

1016
01:07:43.623 --> 01:07:46.795
Even after grounding me. I
still get high every day.

1017
01:07:46.795 --> 01:07:49.863
And two days ago you found my stash.

1018
01:07:49.863 --> 01:07:52.296
Mom. you broke down and cried.

1019
01:07:52.296 --> 01:07:55.795
while dad. you yelled
your fucking ass off.

1020
01:07:55.795 --> 01:07:59.846
Boarding school. rehab. fuck all of that.

1021
01:07:59.846 --> 01:08:03.336
I will never go to those places ever.

1022
01:08:03.336 --> 01:08:05.664
All I want to do is throw an epic party

1023
01:08:05.664 --> 01:08:07.486
before senior year ends.

1024
01:08:07.486 --> 01:08:08.663
That's it.

1025
01:08:08.663 --> 01:08:10.395
That's all I want.

1026
01:08:10.395 --> 01:08:12.006
I know it may never happen.

1027
01:08:12.006 --> 01:08:15.873
but I dream of it every day. every night.

1028
01:08:15.873 --> 01:08:16.984
So fuck it.

1029
01:08:16.984 --> 01:08:18.488
Fuck it all.

1030
01:08:18.488 --> 01:08:20.616
I'm gonna throw a party no matter what.

1031
01:08:20.616 --> 01:08:22.627
and it will be awesome.

1032
01:08:22.627 --> 01:08:25.364
Without any love. Travis.
