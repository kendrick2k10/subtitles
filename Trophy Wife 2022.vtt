Get into the bag.

5
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:17.517
Get into the paper.

6
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.482
I want some land.

7
00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:19.586
I want neighbors.

8
00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.068
Seat in the grass.
not on the pavement.

9
00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:22.034
You see the sass.

10
00:00:22.137 --> 00:00:23.172
I need a payment.

11
00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:24.827
I'm talking big
boats. big yachts.

12
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:26.448
I tell a bitch. go kick rocks.

13
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:28.413
I hate a bitch that ain't
minding her business.

14
00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:29.275
She's just a fan.

15
00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:30.586
I ain't signing no pictures.

16
00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.655
I got the money bags.
money bags. money bags.

17
00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:37.068
I got the money bags.
money bags. money bags.

18
00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:41.137
I got the money bags.
money bags. money bags.

19
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.965
I got the money bags.
money bags. money bags.

20
00:00:45.068 --> 00:00:46.793
Don't want me to lose.
don't want me to win.

21
00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:47.724
They said I can't do it.

22
00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:49.034
I did it again.

23
00:00:49.137 --> 00:00:50.655
If you don't eat it.
I get with his friend.

24
00:00:50.758 --> 00:00:51.655
I ain't on nine. bitch.

25
00:00:51.758 --> 00:00:52.931
I'm on 10.

26
00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:54.379
How about you not be
so worried about me?

27
00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:56.103
Maybe you should be worrying
about paying your rent.

28
00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:57.724
Maybe they asking me--

29
00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:07.103
Good morning. sleepyhead.

30
00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:08.344
Good morning. baby.

31
00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:16.551
I can't.

32
00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.931
I got an early meeting.
and I'm running late.

33
00:01:19.034 --> 00:01:19.758
What?

34
00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:21.137
Yeah.

35
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:22.241
We just got here.

36
00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:26.275
Another late night meeting?

37
00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:28.103
Toni. don't start.

38
00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:30.724
You promised me you would
spend more time at home.

39
00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:33.413
But when business
calls. I got to answer.

40
00:01:33.517 --> 00:01:37.206
Well. your wife misses you.

41
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.724
Look. I miss you. too.

42
00:01:38.827 --> 00:01:41.241
And I promise we'll have a
romantic dinner tonight. OK?

43
00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:45.551
How about a little dessert?

44
00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:49.724
You know. as much
as I would love that. I can't.

45
00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.931
So. uh. what y'all
getting into today?

46
00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:58.965
Nicole is coming
back for lunch later.

47
00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:00.517
All right.

48
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.448
Sounds like fun.

49
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:21.862
it's not
what you think.

50
00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:24.241
What am I thinking. Marc?

51
00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.344
I can explain.

52
00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:30.275
You promised me.

53
00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.379
Look. I swear to
God. nothing happened.

54
00:02:34.482 --> 00:02:36.655
Smells like another woman.

55
00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:37.551
It was a strip club.

56
00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:38.275
A strip club?

57
00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.793
Yeah. a strip club.

58
00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:40.827
Clients wanted to go.

59
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:41.758
They had a couple of lap dances.

60
00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:42.689
That's it.

61
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:49.000
I don't believe you.

62
00:02:49.103 --> 00:02:50.551
Who is she?

63
00:02:50.655 --> 00:02:52.172
Look. baby. I swear to God.
nothing happened last night.

64
00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:53.793
- Who is she?
- Hey. you need to calm down.

65
00:02:53.896 --> 00:02:54.620
Who--

66
00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:55.793
Calm down!

67
00:02:55.896 --> 00:02:56.896
You know what happens
when you get upset.

68
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.965
You take your meds?

69
00:02:58.068 --> 00:02:59.758
Don't do that.

70
00:02:59.862 --> 00:03:02.137
I am not crazy.

71
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:03.793
I know you're not crazy.

72
00:03:03.896 --> 00:03:06.931
But with your
depression. your anxiety?

73
00:03:07.034 --> 00:03:09.344
I just want to make sure you're
following doctor's orders.

74
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.172
Look. I got to go.

75
00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:16.896
But I'm gonna come
home early. we're gonna

76
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.344
get some quality time. OK?

77
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.241
Well. hello. handsome.

78
00:04:47.344 --> 00:04:49.413
Hey. yourself.

79
00:04:49.517 --> 00:04:51.586
I've never seen you
around here before.

80
00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.137
Yeah. well. I'm new here.

81
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:56.931
Hmm.

82
00:04:57.034 --> 00:04:59.000
Well. I'm Nicole. by the way.

83
00:04:59.103 --> 00:05:01.068
August.

84
00:05:01.172 --> 00:05:03.344
You look familiar.

85
00:05:03.448 --> 00:05:06.137
Well. I guess I just
have one of those faces.

86
00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:07.137
Hmm.

87
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.448
I guess I'll see you around.

88
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:10.551
I'm sure you will.

89
00:05:13.517 --> 00:05:14.551
Damn. you fine.

90
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.000
Toni. girl!

91
00:05:19.103 --> 00:05:20.137
Hey. girl.

92
00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:22.103
Oh my God. this
spread is amazing.

93
00:05:22.206 --> 00:05:23.517
Maggie. you really
outdid yourself.

94
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.379
Girl. I got to get
you something nice.

95
00:05:25.482 --> 00:05:28.241
Let me get a plate.

96
00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:29.965
Earth to Toni!

97
00:05:30.068 --> 00:05:31.103
My bad.

98
00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:32.551
Hoo.

99
00:05:32.655 --> 00:05:34.758
Girl. you have been holding out.

100
00:05:34.862 --> 00:05:36.275
Girl. what are
you talking about?

101
00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.206
That specimen that
is laying your grass.

102
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.241
August?

103
00:05:41.344 --> 00:05:42.275
Mm-hmm.

104
00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.000
Well. I ain't even seen him.

105
00:05:44.103 --> 00:05:45.137
Please.

106
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:46.068
What you mean.
you ain't noticed?

107
00:05:46.172 --> 00:05:47.586
That man is fine.

108
00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.551
Because I got better things
to do than sit and watch

109
00:05:49.655 --> 00:05:51.068
my landscaper all day.

110
00:05:51.172 --> 00:05:55.241
Well. he can landscape my
yard any time he wants to.

111
00:05:55.344 --> 00:05:57.517
Calm your little
hormones down. OK?

112
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.620
Shouldn't you be focused
on your wedding to Victor?

113
00:05:59.724 --> 00:06:00.275
Oh. God.

114
00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:01.965
Don't remind me.

115
00:06:02.068 --> 00:06:04.620
Between his busy schedule and
mine. we ain't even set a date.

116
00:06:04.724 --> 00:06:05.517
What?

117
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.793
You still waiting to move in?

118
00:06:06.896 --> 00:06:08.241
Uh. yeah.

119
00:06:08.344 --> 00:06:11.068
You don't get this cookie until
you buy the whole cookie jar.

120
00:06:11.172 --> 00:06:12.103
Hmm.

121
00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:17.620
Toni. what's wrong?

122
00:06:17.724 --> 00:06:18.793
Marc.

123
00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:19.758
What now?

124
00:06:22.344 --> 00:06:24.103
He was out all night.

125
00:06:24.206 --> 00:06:24.931
Again.

126
00:06:25.034 --> 00:06:25.896
Again?

127
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.206
Where did he say
he was this time?

128
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.103
Girl--

129
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.689
Excuse me. ladies.

130
00:06:35.793 --> 00:06:37.793
Miss Toni. where
do you want them?

131
00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:39.724
You can just
put it over there.

132
00:06:39.827 --> 00:06:40.413
Hmm.

133
00:06:40.517 --> 00:06:42.103
The strip club.

134
00:06:42.206 --> 00:06:43.241
Talking about his business.

135
00:06:43.344 --> 00:06:44.758
I am so sick of his lies.

136
00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:47.172
All it is lie. after
lie. after lie.

137
00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:49.310
I'm fed up.

138
00:06:49.413 --> 00:06:50.724
Honey. I am so sorry.

139
00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.620
You deserve so much more
than what he's giving you.

140
00:06:52.724 --> 00:06:53.827
OK?

141
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:55.172
And he was the one that
said he wanted a family.

142
00:06:55.275 --> 00:06:57.000
Now he can't even come home?

143
00:06:57.103 --> 00:06:58.344
Is that too much to ask?

144
00:06:58.448 --> 00:06:59.689
No. it's not.

145
00:06:59.793 --> 00:07:02.689
Listen. you're gonna
drive yourself crazy.

146
00:07:02.793 --> 00:07:04.551
Just end up in a loony bin
or something like that.

147
00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:05.793
Like my mother?

148
00:07:05.896 --> 00:07:07.413
Toni. I didn't mean that.

149
00:07:07.517 --> 00:07:08.482
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:08.586 --> 00:07:09.448
Your mother was her own woman.

151
00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:11.000
She had her own problems.

152
00:07:11.103 --> 00:07:16.034
I just want you to focus
on your own well-being.

153
00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:17.275
I'm stressed out.

154
00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.068
I know.

155
00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:20.896
I can't eat.

156
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.827
I'm not sleeping.

157
00:07:26.275 --> 00:07:27.482
You gonna be all right.

158
00:07:30.862 --> 00:07:34.206
Now. tell me about
this landscaper.

159
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.103
Thank you. girl.

160
00:07:40.275 --> 00:07:41.068
Come on.

161
00:07:44.862 --> 00:07:47.758
Promise me you'll get some rest?

162
00:07:47.862 --> 00:07:50.379
Mm-hmm.

163
00:07:50.482 --> 00:07:51.551
I promise.

164
00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:52.689
All right.

165
00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:56.172
All right.

166
00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:01.862
I'll check on you later.

167
00:08:01.965 --> 00:08:02.793
Love you.

168
00:08:22.655 --> 00:08:23.413
Hey. Miss Toni.

169
00:08:23.517 --> 00:08:26.206
Are you good?

170
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.103
It is what it is.

171
00:08:28.206 --> 00:08:30.206
Right. right.

172
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.206
Well. I hope you feel better.

173
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.034
Really?

174
00:08:37.137 --> 00:08:37.862
A flower?

175
00:08:37.965 --> 00:08:40.344
Yes. a gift from me to you.

176
00:08:40.448 --> 00:08:41.551
You're smiling already.

177
00:08:41.655 --> 00:08:43.172
Just take it.

178
00:08:43.275 --> 00:08:44.206
That's really cute.

179
00:08:48.413 --> 00:08:51.724
Um. have a good day. August.

180
00:08:54.034 --> 00:08:54.896
Bye. Miss Toni.

181
00:09:04.482 --> 00:09:05.689
Yeah. man.

182
00:09:05.793 --> 00:09:06.862
New interface looks
great with the game.

183
00:09:06.965 --> 00:09:07.862
THOMAS Yeah. yeah.

184
00:09:07.965 --> 00:09:09.413
It's looking really good.

185
00:09:09.517 --> 00:09:10.931
Yeah. the demo should be
done by the end of the month.

186
00:09:11.034 --> 00:09:12.379

00:09:14.827 --> 00:09:16.758
Well. hello. beautiful.

you back a little bit later.

00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:28.965
Maybe next week?

198
00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:29.862

203
00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:38.275
Have a seat.

204
00:09:38.379 --> 00:09:39.172
Can I get you a drink?

205
00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:39.827
Oh. no.

206
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:40.965
I'm actually good.

207
00:09:41.068 --> 00:09:41.793
Thank you.

208
00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:42.758
OK.

209
00:09:42.862 --> 00:09:44.000
OK. so if there's
nothing else.

210
00:09:44.103 --> 00:09:45.551
I'm going to get
ready to head out.

211
00:09:45.655 --> 00:09:47.275
Remember. you have the
meeting with Victor.

212
00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.827
Yeah.

213
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:51.620
And the prepping for the
anniversary party. remember?

214
00:09:51.724 --> 00:09:53.103

215
00:09:53.206 --> 00:09:53.827
Thank you. Wanda.

216
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:54.655

217
00:09:54.758 --> 00:09:55.482
Bye. girl.

218
00:09:55.586 --> 00:09:56.931
All right. bye-bye.

219
00:09:57.034 --> 00:09:59.068
If it wasn't for Wanda.
I'd forget my own name.

220
00:10:00.137 --> 00:10:01.551
Yeah. you always
been like that.

221
00:10:01.655 --> 00:10:03.724
Well. you know. getting old.

222
00:10:03.827 --> 00:10:05.344
Yeah. nothing has changed.

223
00:10:05.448 --> 00:10:07.000
Hey. Marc. I tried--

224
00:10:07.103 --> 00:10:07.758
sorry.

225
00:10:07.862 --> 00:10:08.931
You're in a meeting.

226
00:10:09.034 --> 00:10:10.448
Victor Morales.
I'd like you to meet

227
00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:12.896
the beautiful Carmen Riley
from "Just Be Me" magazine.

228
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.551
She's interviewing me
for Holden's anniversary.

229
00:10:15.655 --> 00:10:17.137
Nice to meet you. Victor.

230
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.586
I'm pretty sure I'll be needing
to talk to you soon as well.

231
00:10:18.689 --> 00:10:19.413
Sure.

232
00:10:19.517 --> 00:10:20.862
Nice meeting you.

233
00:10:20.965 --> 00:10:22.862
Hey. can you meet me
in the conference room?

234
00:10:22.965 --> 00:10:25.137
I want to show you a deck
I'm presenting to the venture

235
00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:26.689
capitalist tomorrow.

236
00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:27.689
Well. I can't.

237
00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:28.965
We're about to have dinner.

238
00:10:29.068 --> 00:10:31.517
Can we just talk
about it tomorrow?

239
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.310
Yeah. yeah.

240
00:10:33.413 --> 00:10:34.448
Whatever you say.

241
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:37.275
I'll let you finish
your meeting.

242
00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:39.586
OK.

243
00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:40.862
Sorry about that.

244
00:10:40.965 --> 00:10:43.413
You always have
something up your sleeve.

245
00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:44.344
Dinner?

246
00:10:44.448 --> 00:10:45.965
Mm-hmm.

247
00:10:46.068 --> 00:10:48.413
You know. I just realized. I
haven't eaten anything all day.

248
00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:49.793
Hmm.

249
00:10:49.896 --> 00:10:50.896
Well. I guess you better
be lucky that I'm not

250
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.620
turning down a free meal. then.

251
00:10:52.724 --> 00:10:53.965
I hope not.

252
00:10:54.068 --> 00:10:56.482
I know a good spot near here.

253
00:10:56.586 --> 00:10:57.448
Let's go.

254
00:10:57.551 --> 00:10:58.379
All right.

255
00:11:06.172 --> 00:11:09.862
Let's go somewhere
where we can be alone.

256
00:11:09.965 --> 00:11:12.724
pulling you close.
wrapped in your arms.

257
00:11:12.827 --> 00:11:14.655
By the way you're
looking in my eyes.

258
00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:16.206
I can tell you want me now.

259
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.689
I ain't worried
about no wait. miss.

260
00:11:17.793 --> 00:11:20.103
I'm gonna kill it
till you make a sound.

261
00:11:20.206 --> 00:11:22.896
Ooh. like a siren.
you're going off.

262
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.655
And we're spilling everywhere
like somebody left the lid off.

263
00:11:26.758 --> 00:11:29.172
The way that I feel.
ain't no way I'm going.

264
00:11:29.275 --> 00:11:31.724
So just watch that beast
come out of me. girl.

265
00:11:31.827 --> 00:11:32.827
like a monster.

266
00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:35.034
Standing in pain.
take the charge.

267
00:11:36.551 --> 00:11:39.827
Like we got unfinished business.
let's link back up tomorrow.

268
00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:43.241
I'm gonna have you feeling
you can take on an army.

269
00:11:43.344 --> 00:11:46.655
if they standing in between
with you in front of me.

270
00:11:46.758 --> 00:11:50.103
I'm gonna go to work on
your body like an army.

271
00:11:50.206 --> 00:11:51.241
No surrender.

272
00:11:51.344 --> 00:11:53.068
I ain't gonna light you
up like the morning.

273
00:11:53.172 --> 00:11:57.206
I'm gonna have you feeling
you can take on an army

274
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.724
if they standing in between
with you in front of me.

275
00:11:59.827 --> 00:12:05.724
Oh.

276
00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:07.896
Who would have
thought. you know?

277
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.862
After all these years.
us connecting again.

278
00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:14.448
I--

279
00:12:14.551 --> 00:12:16.586
I got a confession to make.

280
00:12:16.689 --> 00:12:18.137
What is that?

281
00:12:18.241 --> 00:12:21.448
When "Just Be Me" magazine
called me for an interview.

282
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:22.586
I requested you.

283
00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:24.413
Really?

284
00:12:24.517 --> 00:12:25.310
Really.

285
00:12:27.068 --> 00:12:30.275
Well. speaking of work. we got
to get back to that interview.

286
00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:32.413
right?

287
00:12:32.517 --> 00:12:35.310
Let's do it.

288
00:12:35.413 --> 00:12:37.000
So talk to me.

289
00:12:37.103 --> 00:12:41.379
10 years of designing
and selling games.

290
00:12:41.482 --> 00:12:43.000
Mm-hmm.

291
00:12:43.103 --> 00:12:46.241
All of them which landed in
the best top 10 sellers list.

292
00:12:46.344 --> 00:12:50.310
may I add. you know.
that's very impressive.

293
00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:51.689
Thank you.

294
00:12:51.793 --> 00:12:56.551
How does a wife like
yours deal with having

295
00:12:56.655 --> 00:12:59.482
such a successful husband?

296
00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:01.551
Well. first of
all. she's fine.

297
00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:02.862
Hmm?

298
00:13:02.965 --> 00:13:05.103
She has nothing
to worry about.

299
00:13:05.206 --> 00:13:08.724
Because at the end of the
day. I'll always choose her.

300
00:13:08.827 --> 00:13:10.172
Hmm.

301
00:13:10.275 --> 00:13:11.482
Really?

302
00:13:11.586 --> 00:13:12.482
Mhm.

303
00:13:12.586 --> 00:13:14.448
We just work.

304
00:13:14.551 --> 00:13:15.965
Hmm.

305
00:13:16.068 --> 00:13:20.758
Her name. status got me
into a lot of important rooms.

306
00:13:20.862 --> 00:13:22.724
I wouldn't have
Holden without her.

307
00:13:22.827 --> 00:13:25.068
Right.

308
00:13:25.172 --> 00:13:27.862
But it seems like you're the
one with the status now. right?

309
00:13:30.137 --> 00:13:33.551
No more talk about work.

310
00:13:33.655 --> 00:13:35.103
Or my wife.

311
00:13:35.206 --> 00:13:36.137
Oh.

312
00:13:36.241 --> 00:13:39.000
So what do you
want to talk about?

313
00:13:39.103 --> 00:13:41.793
Let's make up for lost time.

314
00:13:41.896 --> 00:13:43.275
I guess the interview's over.

315
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:52.275
Toni. come on. babe.

316
00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:53.206
Open the door.

317
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.034
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:10.000
Toni.

319
00:14:10.103 --> 00:14:10.827
Come on. babe.

320
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:12.000
Open the door.

321
00:15:15.241 --> 00:15:17.448
I called you several
times last night.

322
00:15:17.551 --> 00:15:18.862
Hmm.

323
00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:20.000
I'm sorry. babe.

324
00:15:22.931 --> 00:15:24.551
Sorry?

325
00:15:24.655 --> 00:15:26.379
That's all you have to say?

326
00:15:26.482 --> 00:15:28.724
I'm sorry?

327
00:15:28.827 --> 00:15:32.551
"Sorry" should have brought
your ass home last night.

328
00:15:32.655 --> 00:15:35.137
I can't even believe you.

329
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:36.379
And you're never gonna change.

330
00:15:36.482 --> 00:15:37.724
You act like I
did this on purpose.

331
00:15:37.827 --> 00:15:39.586
You do. Marc.

332
00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:42.103
And it's time for you to
make some better choices.

333
00:15:42.206 --> 00:15:45.379
What kind of choices
are you talking about?

334
00:15:45.482 --> 00:15:46.896
I'm talking about
you considering

335
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.586
selling the business. so
we can start our family.

336
00:15:49.689 --> 00:15:51.413
What?

337
00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:54.310
You promised me.

338
00:15:54.413 --> 00:15:56.413
I gave up a successful
modeling career

339
00:15:56.517 --> 00:15:59.000
because you wanted me to stay
home and raise our children.

340
00:16:01.413 --> 00:16:04.551
Where our babies at. Marc?

341
00:16:04.655 --> 00:16:07.310
All I get from you
is lies and women.

342
00:16:07.413 --> 00:16:08.724
Women?

343
00:16:08.827 --> 00:16:10.000
Where all these imaginary women
that you're talking about?

344
00:16:10.103 --> 00:16:12.586
Don't play me. Marc.

345
00:16:12.689 --> 00:16:17.206
I packed all your shit. and
I put it in the guest room.

346
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:21.068
You don't care about spending
time with me anyways. right?

347
00:16:21.172 --> 00:16:22.000
Toni. don't do this.

348
00:16:22.103 --> 00:16:23.206
It's done.

349
00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.413
And I'm done with
this conversation.

350
00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:34.827
I'm so sick of Marc and
his lies that it has

351
00:16:34.931 --> 00:16:37.000
my anxiety at an all-time high.

352
00:16:37.103 --> 00:16:39.034
Are you still having
a hard time sleeping?

353
00:16:39.137 --> 00:16:40.724
No idea.

354
00:16:40.827 --> 00:16:42.206
I don't know what to do.

355
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.103
Have you felt the
urge to harm yourself?

356
00:16:46.206 --> 00:16:48.517
I'm not cutting anymore.
if that's what you mean.

357
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:49.689
OK. that's good.

358
00:16:49.793 --> 00:16:51.275
I'm really happy to hear that.

359
00:16:51.379 --> 00:16:52.689
The progress that
you've been making.

360
00:16:52.793 --> 00:16:54.793
Toni. has just been phenomenal.

361
00:16:54.896 --> 00:16:56.758
Now. at times it
may feel difficult.

362
00:16:56.862 --> 00:16:59.793
but you are managing
your stress.

363
00:16:59.896 --> 00:17:01.379
OK. so what do I do?

364
00:17:01.482 --> 00:17:03.137
Well. I'm still going to
write you a prescription

365
00:17:03.241 --> 00:17:04.551
to help you with your sleeping.

366
00:17:04.655 --> 00:17:06.241
Please. don't give
me any more pills.

367
00:17:06.344 --> 00:17:08.586
The last pills you gave
me. they made me lethargic.

368
00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:10.000
My mind was all foggy.

369
00:17:10.103 --> 00:17:12.172
I understand. but it's just
your body getting adjusted.

370
00:17:12.275 --> 00:17:13.793
That's all.

371
00:17:13.896 --> 00:17:16.517
So let's just stick with it for
now. and we'll see how it goes.

372
00:17:21.758 --> 00:17:23.862
I just reviewed the
terms of the deal.

373
00:17:23.965 --> 00:17:25.413
And I think we can
make this happen.

374
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.137
Yeah. yeah.

375
00:17:29.241 --> 00:17:31.379
Just-- just give me
a couple of days.

376
00:17:31.482 --> 00:17:33.724
Let me talk it over with Marc.
and I'll get back to you.

377
00:17:37.206 --> 00:17:38.620
Actually. we're having
our 10-year anniversary

378
00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:41.103
of Holden Gaming tonight.
and the Carters are hosting.

379
00:17:41.206 --> 00:17:44.655
You should-- you
should come through.

380
00:17:44.758 --> 00:17:45.827
Yeah.

381
00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:47.137
All right.

382
00:17:47.241 --> 00:17:50.862
I'll-- I'll send you
the information later.

383
00:17:50.965 --> 00:17:52.137
All right. bye.

384
00:17:52.241 --> 00:17:54.965
Hey. babe.

385
00:17:55.068 --> 00:17:55.965
What you doing?

386
00:17:56.068 --> 00:17:58.000
Well. well. well.

387
00:17:59.103 --> 00:18:00.862
Isn't this a nice surprise?

388
00:18:00.965 --> 00:18:02.275
I was in the neighborhood.

389
00:18:02.379 --> 00:18:04.448
I thought I'd come by and
see my handsome fiancé.

390
00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:07.000
Well. I'm glad you did.
because it made my day.

391
00:18:07.103 --> 00:18:07.931
Hmm!

392
00:18:14.413 --> 00:18:16.379
While I'm here. we might
as well make an appointment

393
00:18:16.482 --> 00:18:19.137
with the wedding planner.

394
00:18:19.241 --> 00:18:24.000
Or-- or we can head
straight for the Justice

395
00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:25.724
of Peace right now.

396
00:18:25.827 --> 00:18:26.862
Hmm.

397
00:18:26.965 --> 00:18:28.068
Hmm?

398
00:18:28.172 --> 00:18:29.310
What would you say to that?

399
00:18:29.413 --> 00:18:32.275
You better stop.

400
00:18:32.379 --> 00:18:33.379
Where's Marc?

401
00:18:37.172 --> 00:18:38.724
I don't know.

402
00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.000
I can't keep up anymore.

403
00:18:40.103 --> 00:18:43.517
It's like-- it's like
he's avoiding me.

404
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.965
What happened?

405
00:18:46.068 --> 00:18:47.896
Just ever since we got this--

406
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.034
this offer to buy us out.
he's just been ghosting me.

407
00:18:52.137 --> 00:18:53.448
I mean. I get it.

408
00:18:53.551 --> 00:18:55.241
He doesn't want to talk
about selling. but this--

409
00:18:55.344 --> 00:18:58.862
this will change the
game for both of us.

410
00:18:58.965 --> 00:19:00.448
Well. he's gonna come around.

411
00:19:05.137 --> 00:19:06.827
Yeah. he better.

412
00:19:06.931 --> 00:19:09.482
Because we only got a
small window to sell.

413
00:19:09.586 --> 00:19:13.275
Plus. I need all the money I
can get to fund this wedding

414
00:19:13.379 --> 00:19:14.551
you're planning. right?

415
00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:15.413
Hmm?

416
00:19:15.517 --> 00:19:16.586
- Yes. you do.
- Mm-hmm.

417
00:19:16.689 --> 00:19:17.517
Yeah.

418
00:19:20.275 --> 00:19:23.827
Hey. sunshine.

419
00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:25.413
You're home early.

420
00:19:25.517 --> 00:19:27.551
I thought I told you you were
staying in the guest bedroom.

421
00:19:27.655 --> 00:19:29.068
Well. I haven't been
around much lately.

422
00:19:29.172 --> 00:19:30.931
and I wanted to
make it up to you.

423
00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:34.758
Hmm.

424
00:19:39.068 --> 00:19:39.931
Open it.

425
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:43.275
Come on. let me
show you some love.

426
00:19:43.379 --> 00:19:44.482
Please. open the bag.

427
00:20:04.896 --> 00:20:05.931
It's nice.

428
00:20:06.034 --> 00:20:06.689
Look. Toni.
don't be like that.

429
00:20:06.793 --> 00:20:07.862
I'm trying.

430
00:20:07.965 --> 00:20:09.241
If you were trying.
I'd have babies by now.

431
00:20:09.344 --> 00:20:10.275
If you were trying.
you wouldn't have

432
00:20:10.379 --> 00:20:11.517
to give me this peace offering.

433
00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.310
If you were trying.
you would love me.

434
00:20:12.413 --> 00:20:14.517
I do love you.

435
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.965
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

436
00:20:17.068 --> 00:20:19.034
I know you deserve better.
and I want to give you better.

437
00:20:19.137 --> 00:20:22.103
Just give me a chance to try.

438
00:20:22.206 --> 00:20:23.758
How many chances do you need?

439
00:20:23.862 --> 00:20:25.965
Toni. I am begging
you. just let me try.

440
00:20:53.413 --> 00:20:55.482
You really think
it's that easy. huh?

441
00:20:55.586 --> 00:20:57.551
You can just come in here
with expensive gifts. kisses

442
00:20:57.655 --> 00:20:58.241
and what?

443
00:20:58.344 --> 00:20:59.068
I'm supposed to?

444
00:20:59.172 --> 00:21:00.586
Melt

445
00:21:00.689 --> 00:21:01.551
No.

446
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:08.344
You just don't even
take anything serious.

447
00:21:08.448 --> 00:21:09.793
unless it's Holden Games.

448
00:21:12.241 --> 00:21:14.689
This is our marriage.

449
00:21:14.793 --> 00:21:16.655
You do not get to
keep hurting me.

450
00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:18.586
I know.

451
00:21:18.689 --> 00:21:24.896
And that's why I'm here
with you. in our home.

452
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.965
I want to start over.

453
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.862
I want to start a family.

454
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:35.931
I want to start now.

455
00:22:45.827 --> 00:22:48.931
Why are you calling me so late?

456
00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:51.103
Yeah. I know I promised to
come over. but plans changed.

457
00:22:54.793 --> 00:22:58.896
You know. this thing.
this isn't working for me.

458
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.068
It's over.

459
00:23:01.172 --> 00:23:02.000
Good night.

460
00:23:19.724 --> 00:23:20.655
Mom. what are you doing here?

461
00:23:20.758 --> 00:23:21.689
The party's not till tonight.

462
00:23:21.793 --> 00:23:23.551
Well. hello to you. too. son.

463
00:23:23.655 --> 00:23:24.827
Yeah. Mom wanted
us to come early.

464
00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:26.275
to see if you needed
help on anything.

465
00:23:26.379 --> 00:23:27.310
We've got everything covered.

466
00:23:27.413 --> 00:23:29.379
You know I do have a staff.

467
00:23:29.482 --> 00:23:30.758
Where's Toni?

468
00:23:30.862 --> 00:23:32.275
Uh. she's out shopping
with her grandmother.

469
00:23:32.379 --> 00:23:34.000
I thought she
wasn't feeling well.

470
00:23:34.103 --> 00:23:36.103
Yeah. didn't you say she
had some sort of a breakdown?

471
00:23:36.206 --> 00:23:37.310
London.

472
00:23:37.413 --> 00:23:38.862
I mean. that is
what you said. right?

473
00:23:38.965 --> 00:23:40.206
She's got some anxiety issues.
but she's dealing with it.

474
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:41.689
But she has to
get herself healthy.

475
00:23:41.793 --> 00:23:44.310
Everybody knows she wants
a house full of children.

476
00:23:44.413 --> 00:23:46.551
Grandkids would be
great right about now.

477
00:23:46.655 --> 00:23:48.103
We are working on it.

478
00:23:48.206 --> 00:23:50.724
I just wish you wasn't so
far away from the family.

479
00:23:50.827 --> 00:23:52.862
45 minutes is
not that far away.

480
00:23:52.965 --> 00:23:53.724
It's far enough.

481
00:23:53.827 --> 00:23:54.862
Hmm.

482
00:23:54.965 --> 00:23:56.586
Seems like ever since
you got with Toni.

483
00:23:56.689 --> 00:23:57.862
she's pushed you further and
further away from the family.

484
00:23:57.965 --> 00:23:58.827
No. no. hold on.

485
00:23:58.931 --> 00:23:59.896
No. you need to stop that.
- Why?

486
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.310
She's always acting--

487
00:24:01.413 --> 00:24:02.862
You pushed her away. and
you never gave her a chance.

488
00:24:02.965 --> 00:24:03.965
She's always acting
like she's better than us.

489
00:24:04.068 --> 00:24:05.310
- That's not true.
- Yes. it is.

490
00:24:05.413 --> 00:24:06.827
Look. enough. you two.

491
00:24:06.931 --> 00:24:09.379
Y'all making me feel like
I'm still raising teenagers.

492
00:24:09.482 --> 00:24:11.551
This is driving me crazy.

493
00:24:11.655 --> 00:24:14.068
Doris. London.

494
00:24:14.172 --> 00:24:15.448
Hmm.

495
00:24:15.551 --> 00:24:16.931
Why are you here so early?

496
00:24:17.034 --> 00:24:19.000
We came by to help you
set up for the party.

497
00:24:19.103 --> 00:24:20.689
We didn't want you to
stress yourself trying

498
00:24:20.793 --> 00:24:23.103
to handle everything alone.

499
00:24:23.206 --> 00:24:24.103
No. ma'am.

500
00:24:24.206 --> 00:24:25.758
That's not necessary.

501
00:24:25.862 --> 00:24:27.758
I'm sure Marc told you
everything is covered.

502
00:24:27.862 --> 00:24:29.586
I did.

503
00:24:29.689 --> 00:24:32.482
Maggie. can you take
these upstairs. please?

504
00:24:32.586 --> 00:24:35.448
Thank you.

505
00:24:35.551 --> 00:24:37.034
Miss Thing. I see you
still out spending up

506
00:24:37.137 --> 00:24:40.310
all your accounts at those
bougie boutiques again.

507
00:24:40.413 --> 00:24:41.931
And this is
coming from someone

508
00:24:42.034 --> 00:24:45.137
who doesn't have an account
or a job. for that matter?

509
00:24:45.241 --> 00:24:46.655
What you say?

510
00:24:46.758 --> 00:24:47.689
Hey. Mom. Sis. let's just
go by the pool and hang out?

511
00:24:47.793 --> 00:24:49.034
Let's go upstairs.

512
00:24:49.137 --> 00:24:50.275
Maggie will bring us
some drinks. all right?

513
00:24:50.379 --> 00:24:51.517
Can you join us for a bit?

514
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:53.172
London wants to run
something by you.

515
00:24:53.275 --> 00:24:54.241
What. for another loan?

516
00:24:54.344 --> 00:24:55.379
And what if it is?

517
00:24:55.482 --> 00:24:56.793
It's not like you
can't afford it.

518
00:24:56.896 --> 00:24:58.655
Look. Marc. I thought
you told me everything was

519
00:24:58.758 --> 00:25:00.206
good between the two of you.

520
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.241
Everything is fine.

521
00:25:01.344 --> 00:25:02.655
Just. you know how she is.

522
00:25:22.965 --> 00:25:27.896
Baby girl. I
can't take my eyes

523
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.724
off of you when you're dancing.

524
00:25:31.827 --> 00:25:35.275
Oh. darling. there
is nothing I'd

525
00:25:35.379 --> 00:25:41.103
rather do than dance with you.

526
00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:42.413
Isn't she fancy?

527
00:25:42.517 --> 00:25:43.724
London. don't start.

528
00:25:43.827 --> 00:25:46.068
She's your brother's
wife. for God's sake.

529
00:25:46.172 --> 00:25:48.137
Fine.

530
00:25:48.241 --> 00:25:50.275
Oh. is that my girl?

531
00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:52.206
Oh. Nini.

532
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:55.344
Girl. you look like you're
about to rip the runway again.

533
00:25:55.448 --> 00:25:56.172
Thank you. girl.

534
00:25:56.275 --> 00:25:58.896
You look good. too.

535
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.793
Oh. Marc. I like
that look. too.

536
00:26:00.896 --> 00:26:02.482
Y'all look like cake-toppers.

537
00:26:02.586 --> 00:26:04.103
Come on. give me a hug.

538
00:26:04.206 --> 00:26:04.827
What can I say?

539
00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:06.137
It's a special night.

540
00:26:06.241 --> 00:26:07.655
Me and Victor are
celebrating our milestone.

541
00:26:07.758 --> 00:26:09.793
and my wife put together
an incredible party.

542
00:26:09.896 --> 00:26:12.068
Yes. everything
turned out nice.

543
00:26:12.172 --> 00:26:13.448
Can you guys hold
on for a second?

544
00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:14.689
I got to go holler at Victor.

545
00:26:19.689 --> 00:26:22.655
Girl. let me
see this bracelet.

546
00:26:22.758 --> 00:26:23.931
This looks like the
one I've been eyeing.

547
00:26:24.034 --> 00:26:25.517
Did Marc get this for you?

548
00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.103
Yeah I guess he feels like
it'll make up for his cheating.

549
00:26:29.206 --> 00:26:31.448
If you like it so
much. you can have it.

550
00:26:31.551 --> 00:26:32.241
- Toni.
- Take it off.

551
00:26:32.344 --> 00:26:33.172
No!

552
00:26:38.034 --> 00:26:40.551
I don't know if I should.

553
00:26:40.655 --> 00:26:41.931
I do like it.

554
00:26:42.034 --> 00:26:43.344
And as soon as I get
into the office Monday.

555
00:26:43.448 --> 00:26:46.793
I'll talk to Marc and we'll
get things squared away.

556
00:26:46.896 --> 00:26:48.000
figure out the next steps.

557
00:26:50.689 --> 00:26:51.724
What's up. man?

558
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.551
Hey. man.

559
00:26:56.655 --> 00:26:58.000
How's it going?

560
00:26:58.103 --> 00:26:59.689
What the hell is Matthew
Armstrong doing here?

561
00:27:02.724 --> 00:27:03.931
He's my guest.

562
00:27:04.034 --> 00:27:06.137
I wanted him to see
how good we were doing.

563
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:08.482
I see.

564
00:27:08.586 --> 00:27:10.034
Yeah.

565
00:27:10.137 --> 00:27:11.620
Yeah. we were just trying
to figure out the next step.

566
00:27:11.724 --> 00:27:13.517
Next steps?

567
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.793
Holden's not for sale.

568
00:27:16.862 --> 00:27:17.586
Come on. Marc.

569
00:27:17.689 --> 00:27:19.275
What's your problem?

570
00:27:19.379 --> 00:27:20.551
Problem?

571
00:27:20.655 --> 00:27:21.827
If I don't know any
better. I'd think

572
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:22.655
you were trying to
sell this company out

573
00:27:22.758 --> 00:27:24.137
from behind my back.

574
00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:26.137
I told you I was talking
with different investors.

575
00:27:26.241 --> 00:27:28.620
There's a big difference
between talking with investors

576
00:27:28.724 --> 00:27:29.758
and talking to buyers.

577
00:27:29.862 --> 00:27:34.551
Matthew-- Matthew
wants to acquire

578
00:27:34.655 --> 00:27:37.000
Holden for $200 million.

579
00:27:37.103 --> 00:27:40.000
Man. for the last
time. I am not selling.

580
00:27:42.724 --> 00:27:45.000
Yeah.

581
00:27:45.103 --> 00:27:47.758
Yeah. well. this ain't
your company by yourself.

582
00:27:47.862 --> 00:27:49.379
But you can't
sell it without me.

583
00:27:49.482 --> 00:27:51.103
And it ain't gonna happen
unless I'm in a bodybag.

584
00:27:51.206 --> 00:27:53.103
Yeah. well. if
that's what you want.

585
00:27:53.206 --> 00:27:53.931
It's like that?

586
00:27:54.034 --> 00:27:55.103
Yeah.

587
00:27:55.206 --> 00:27:57.172
It's like that.

588
00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:58.068
Everything OK?

589
00:28:01.793 --> 00:28:02.965
Yeah.

590
00:28:03.068 --> 00:28:06.448
Sorry if we caused
any disturbances.

591
00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:08.655
You look amazing. by the way.

592
00:28:08.758 --> 00:28:11.344
Thank you.

593
00:28:11.448 --> 00:28:12.413
Can I borrow my husband?

594
00:28:15.344 --> 00:28:16.517
Yeah.

595
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.137
Yeah. he's-- he's all yours.

596
00:28:23.689 --> 00:28:24.517
What's going on?

597
00:28:27.275 --> 00:28:30.551
He wants to sell
Holden for $200 million.

598
00:28:30.655 --> 00:28:31.655
So what's the problem?

599
00:28:31.758 --> 00:28:33.344
Sell the company.

600
00:28:33.448 --> 00:28:36.448
The problem is that
I don't want to sell.

601
00:28:36.551 --> 00:28:39.413
You promised me you
would spend time with me.

602
00:28:39.517 --> 00:28:42.344
Again. it's about you.

603
00:28:42.448 --> 00:28:44.655
About me?

604
00:28:44.758 --> 00:28:46.724
I try so hard.

605
00:28:46.827 --> 00:28:48.620
I've worked so hard to
try and make you happy

606
00:28:48.724 --> 00:28:50.758
and-- and it's never enough.

607
00:28:50.862 --> 00:28:52.000
You're selfish.
- I'm selfish?

608
00:28:52.103 --> 00:28:53.137
Yes.

609
00:28:53.241 --> 00:28:55.758
The last person you
can call selfish is me.

610
00:28:55.862 --> 00:28:57.241
I've done nothing but give.

611
00:28:57.344 --> 00:29:00.172
And I'm sick and tired of
coming second to your job.

612
00:29:08.655 --> 00:29:09.517
Hey. Toni.

613
00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.379
You all right?

614
00:29:11.482 --> 00:29:13.310
Not really.

615
00:29:13.413 --> 00:29:16.965
Look. it won't
always be like this.

616
00:29:25.793 --> 00:29:27.310
Thank you.

617
00:29:27.413 --> 00:29:29.275
I was just trying to get
him down the aisle. Mama.

618
00:29:29.379 --> 00:29:30.137
OK?

619
00:29:30.896 --> 00:29:31.758
Yeah.

620
00:29:31.862 --> 00:29:33.379
Well. don't try too hard.

621
00:29:33.482 --> 00:29:35.620
Maybe you're pushing him
away if you're trying--

622
00:29:35.724 --> 00:29:37.724
I mean. he asked.

623
00:29:37.827 --> 00:29:41.758
Oh. well. then
when are the plans?

624
00:29:41.862 --> 00:29:42.655
We're going to plan soon.

625
00:29:42.758 --> 00:29:43.896
Oh.

626
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.103
He's just been busy
with the company.

627
00:29:45.206 --> 00:29:45.793
Hey. hey.

628
00:29:45.896 --> 00:29:46.758
How are you?

629
00:29:46.862 --> 00:29:47.724
Congratulations.

630
00:29:47.827 --> 00:29:48.793
Thank you.

631
00:29:48.896 --> 00:29:51.275
Have a seat.

632
00:29:51.379 --> 00:29:53.655
See you.

633
00:29:53.758 --> 00:29:55.586
Hey. babe.

634
00:29:55.689 --> 00:29:56.620
Hey.

635
00:29:56.724 --> 00:29:59.827
You. uh-- you ready to leave?

636
00:29:59.931 --> 00:30:01.103
I know I am.

637
00:30:01.206 --> 00:30:02.379
How are you gonna
leave your own party?

638
00:30:05.482 --> 00:30:06.655
It's Marc.

639
00:30:06.758 --> 00:30:08.241
I-- I just I can't
with him right now.

640
00:30:08.344 --> 00:30:10.103
That fool still
don't want to sell.

641
00:30:10.206 --> 00:30:13.172
I'll just make
you a stiff drink.

642
00:30:13.275 --> 00:30:17.172
Enjoy this old school music. and
I'm gonna check on you later.

643
00:30:20.379 --> 00:30:21.137
Yeah.

644
00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:22.137
All right?

645
00:30:22.241 --> 00:30:22.758
Yeah.

646
00:30:22.862 --> 00:30:23.931
All right.

647
00:30:30.586 --> 00:30:34.275
Girl. who is that over
there talking to Marc?

648
00:30:34.379 --> 00:30:36.551
I don't know.

649
00:30:36.655 --> 00:30:38.068
But she's gorgeous.

650
00:30:38.172 --> 00:30:39.827
And she looks like Marc's type.

651
00:30:42.586 --> 00:30:43.310
Another drink.

652
00:30:43.413 --> 00:30:44.586
Uh-uh.

653
00:30:44.689 --> 00:30:45.793
Girl. you know you're not
supposed to be drinking.

654
00:30:45.896 --> 00:30:47.000
Nicole. give me this drink.

655
00:30:50.034 --> 00:30:51.034
I'm going over there.

656
00:30:54.137 --> 00:30:56.172
Let me know if
you need backup.

657
00:30:56.275 --> 00:30:58.000
Well. don't you
look good tonight.

658
00:30:58.103 --> 00:31:00.655
Carmen. why are you here?

659
00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:02.689
Well. I just figured since
we was working on the article.

660
00:31:02.793 --> 00:31:04.931
it wouldn't be right unless
I spoke to your wife.

661
00:31:05.034 --> 00:31:06.000
That is not a good idea.

662
00:31:06.103 --> 00:31:06.827
You need to go.

663
00:31:06.931 --> 00:31:08.275
I'm here.

664
00:31:08.379 --> 00:31:09.413
Hey. babe.

665
00:31:09.517 --> 00:31:11.137
This is Carmen from
"Just Be Me" magazine.

666
00:31:11.241 --> 00:31:13.551
She's doing an interview about
me and Victor and Holden.

667
00:31:13.655 --> 00:31:14.862
It's so nice to meet you.

668
00:31:14.965 --> 00:31:16.275
such a beautiful dress. Toni.

669
00:31:16.379 --> 00:31:18.620
So is Carmen the reason
you're out late at night?

670
00:31:21.206 --> 00:31:22.344
Toni. don't do this.

671
00:31:22.448 --> 00:31:23.379
Don't do what?

672
00:31:23.482 --> 00:31:24.689
Just asking a question.

673
00:31:24.793 --> 00:31:27.413
Uh. you shouldn't be drinking
that in your condition.

674
00:31:27.517 --> 00:31:29.931
Oh. I-- I didn't
know you were so sick.

675
00:31:30.034 --> 00:31:32.000
You hide it so well.

676
00:31:32.103 --> 00:31:33.655
I'm perfectly fine.

677
00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.068
Oh.

678
00:31:35.172 --> 00:31:37.137
Well. listen. I don't know
what Marc has told you.

679
00:31:37.241 --> 00:31:38.413
That's the thing. Carmen.

680
00:31:38.517 --> 00:31:40.931
Marc always lies.
especially about what

681
00:31:41.034 --> 00:31:42.965
he does late at night.

682
00:31:43.068 --> 00:31:43.862
Oh. I'm sorry.

683
00:31:43.965 --> 00:31:44.931
I shouldn't have come.

684
00:31:45.034 --> 00:31:45.827
You're right.

685
00:31:45.931 --> 00:31:48.068
You shouldn't have come.

686
00:31:48.172 --> 00:31:49.931
But I do have
something for you.

687
00:31:52.793 --> 00:31:53.758
- You know what?
- What is this?

688
00:31:53.862 --> 00:31:54.689
That's enough.
That's enough.

689
00:31:54.793 --> 00:31:56.448
You need to go.

690
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:57.517
I think we should talk.

691
00:32:00.827 --> 00:32:03.034
Handle this. or I will.

692
00:32:05.586 --> 00:32:06.413
Bye. Toni.

693
00:32:09.965 --> 00:32:10.793
Trampy ho.

694
00:32:10.896 --> 00:32:13.275
Now. hold on.

695
00:32:13.379 --> 00:32:15.034
After all these years.
you're still crazy.

696
00:32:15.137 --> 00:32:16.551
I'm not crazy.

697
00:32:19.586 --> 00:32:21.344
And all of this
should have been mine.

698
00:32:23.827 --> 00:32:24.793
To my house!

699
00:32:24.896 --> 00:32:26.000
Oh!

700
00:32:26.103 --> 00:32:27.862
How could you
embarrass me like that

701
00:32:27.965 --> 00:32:28.965
in front of my guests?

702
00:32:29.068 --> 00:32:29.862
Embarrass you?

703
00:32:29.965 --> 00:32:30.862
Stop right now. son.

704
00:32:30.965 --> 00:32:32.068
I'm trying to calm her down.

705
00:32:32.172 --> 00:32:33.551
I am tired of her antics.

706
00:32:33.655 --> 00:32:36.000
Every single time.
it's another episode!

707
00:32:36.103 --> 00:32:38.034
I do not need you
stressing her any further

708
00:32:38.137 --> 00:32:38.931
than she is right now.

709
00:32:39.034 --> 00:32:40.344
No. no.

710
00:32:40.448 --> 00:32:41.689
You don't get to talk
your way out of this one.

711
00:32:41.793 --> 00:32:42.931
Out of what?

712
00:32:43.034 --> 00:32:44.965
I heard you on the
phone last night!

713
00:32:45.068 --> 00:32:46.862
I heard you talking
to another woman.

714
00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:48.827
Was that her?

715
00:32:48.931 --> 00:32:50.103
Did you sleep with her?

716
00:32:53.172 --> 00:32:54.965
Did you sleep with her?

717
00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:58.068
Yeah.

718
00:33:00.965 --> 00:33:02.896
I did.

719
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.758
And she's not the only one.

720
00:33:05.862 --> 00:33:07.344
Finally.

721
00:33:07.448 --> 00:33:10.379
Finally. for once in your life.
you want to tell the truth.

722
00:33:10.482 --> 00:33:12.586
Maybe I wouldn't have
stepped out on our marriage

723
00:33:12.689 --> 00:33:15.482
if you weren't constantly
having these mental episodes!

724
00:33:15.586 --> 00:33:17.000
I hate--

725
00:33:17.103 --> 00:33:18.517
I hate you!

726
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.551
You know what I am?

727
00:33:19.655 --> 00:33:20.758
You know what I am?

728
00:33:20.862 --> 00:33:21.586
Toni.

729
00:33:21.689 --> 00:33:22.551
I'm done.

730
00:33:22.655 --> 00:33:23.551
I am done.

731
00:33:23.655 --> 00:33:24.758
Oh. you're done?
I'm done.

732
00:33:24.862 --> 00:33:25.724
You're done?

733
00:33:25.827 --> 00:33:27.758
I don't need you anymore.

734
00:33:27.862 --> 00:33:30.275
I'm calling Denver. and
I'm drawing up the papers.

735
00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:34.931
Uh-uh.

736
00:33:35.034 --> 00:33:36.793
I hate you!

737
00:33:36.896 --> 00:33:37.758
You stupid bitch!

738
00:33:37.862 --> 00:33:39.034
You could have killed him!

739
00:33:39.137 --> 00:33:40.034
Shut up!

740
00:33:40.137 --> 00:33:41.034
I hate you!

741
00:33:41.137 --> 00:33:42.137
Come on. baby.

742
00:33:44.965 --> 00:33:47.103
Marc!

743
00:33:47.206 --> 00:33:48.034
What. Marc?
Hold up.

744
00:33:48.137 --> 00:33:48.862
Hold on.

745
00:33:48.965 --> 00:33:50.724
I just need to--

746
00:33:50.827 --> 00:33:52.241
what do you want. Nicole?

747
00:33:52.344 --> 00:33:54.655
You know that's
not all her fault.

748
00:33:54.758 --> 00:33:55.551
You're kidding me. right?

749
00:33:55.655 --> 00:33:57.000
Come on. Marc.

750
00:33:57.103 --> 00:33:59.000
You got this drop dead gorgeous
woman drooling all over you.

751
00:33:59.103 --> 00:34:00.655
Of course she figured it out.

752
00:34:00.758 --> 00:34:01.965
What did you expect?

753
00:34:02.068 --> 00:34:03.586
You can't have your
cake and eat it. too.

754
00:34:03.689 --> 00:34:08.655
You need to mind your
business and stay out of mine.

755
00:34:08.758 --> 00:34:09.862
Fine.

756
00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:11.724
I want to talk to
you about Victor.

757
00:34:11.827 --> 00:34:15.344
I'm not gonna talk
to you about our business.

758
00:34:15.448 --> 00:34:18.413
You're not his wife.
and you're not mine.

759
00:34:18.517 --> 00:34:19.551
So you don't need to know.

760
00:34:57.068 --> 00:34:57.965
Oh my God.

761
00:34:58.068 --> 00:35:00.172
Grandma. it smells so good.

762
00:35:00.275 --> 00:35:03.551
You know you don't
have to do this. right?

763
00:35:03.655 --> 00:35:05.758
I do have Maggie.

764
00:35:05.862 --> 00:35:08.241
Honey. can't nobody cook
better than your grandma.

765
00:35:08.344 --> 00:35:10.551
I can't argue with that.

766
00:35:10.655 --> 00:35:12.931
How are you
feeling this morning?

767
00:35:13.034 --> 00:35:14.586
I'm OK.

768
00:35:14.689 --> 00:35:17.827
I just have this
migraine headache.

769
00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:20.620
Have you seen Marc?

770
00:35:20.724 --> 00:35:22.034
No.

771
00:35:22.137 --> 00:35:23.137
You check his office?

772
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:26.068
Yeah. wasn't there.

773
00:35:26.172 --> 00:35:27.448
Checked the guest bedroom. too.

774
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.965
Baby. can I be frank with you?

775
00:35:33.068 --> 00:35:34.689
Yeah.

776
00:35:34.793 --> 00:35:36.931
I saw something in you
last night I don't like.

777
00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:37.793
I know.

778
00:35:37.896 --> 00:35:38.620
I know.

779
00:35:38.724 --> 00:35:40.000
I'm just fed up.

780
00:35:40.103 --> 00:35:41.413
I can understand that.

781
00:35:41.517 --> 00:35:45.379
But you can't keep mixing
alcohol with your meds.

782
00:35:45.482 --> 00:35:46.103
I know.

783
00:35:46.206 --> 00:35:47.206
Trust me.

784
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:48.379
It only made it worse.

785
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:55.000
Is that Marc?

786
00:35:55.103 --> 00:35:57.310
No. it's just a reminder.

787
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.551
Toni. what's going on?

788
00:36:23.655 --> 00:36:24.310
Hey. Victor.

789
00:36:24.413 --> 00:36:26.034
Have you talked to Marc?

790
00:36:26.137 --> 00:36:27.551
No. I haven't.

791
00:36:27.655 --> 00:36:30.034
He-- he missed our monthly
board meeting this morning.

792
00:36:30.137 --> 00:36:31.448
What?

793
00:36:31.551 --> 00:36:33.310
He never misses a meeting.

794
00:36:33.413 --> 00:36:34.724
Yeah. I know.

795
00:36:34.827 --> 00:36:38.206
He's-- he's probably just
blowing off some steam.

796
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.413
Can you have him
call me as soon

797
00:36:39.517 --> 00:36:41.931
as you talk to him. please?

798
00:36:42.034 --> 00:36:43.103
OK.

799
00:36:43.206 --> 00:36:43.931
OK.

800
00:36:44.034 --> 00:36:44.758
I will.

801
00:36:44.862 --> 00:36:46.413
I'm sure he's fine.

802
00:36:46.517 --> 00:36:47.379
OK.

803
00:37:09.275 --> 00:37:10.034
Hey. girl.

804
00:37:10.137 --> 00:37:12.758
Hey. girl.

805
00:37:12.862 --> 00:37:14.172
How are you feeling?

806
00:37:14.275 --> 00:37:15.413
Hmm.

807
00:37:15.517 --> 00:37:18.206
Stressed. disrespected.

808
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:19.068
Yeah.

809
00:37:19.172 --> 00:37:20.931
Hurt.

810
00:37:21.034 --> 00:37:23.275
All the above.

811
00:37:23.379 --> 00:37:27.551
Can you believe I haven't
talked to Marc all day?

812
00:37:27.655 --> 00:37:29.379
I bet he's with another woman.

813
00:37:29.482 --> 00:37:31.413
Probably that Carmen trick.

814
00:37:31.517 --> 00:37:33.241
I'm surprised
you ain't hit her.

815
00:37:33.344 --> 00:37:35.310
You know I bopped her.

816
00:37:35.413 --> 00:37:36.310
No. you didn't.

817
00:37:36.413 --> 00:37:37.482
Got her right in her throat.

818
00:37:38.413 --> 00:37:40.068
I should have bopped her.

819
00:37:40.172 --> 00:37:41.724
Had the nerve to
show up at my house.

820
00:37:45.068 --> 00:37:47.000
Do you think he was
serious about the divorce?

821
00:37:51.206 --> 00:37:52.000
I don't know.

822
00:37:54.758 --> 00:37:57.482
But we ain't never had a
fight like that before.

823
00:37:57.586 --> 00:38:00.137
I mean. you know
we argue. we fight.

824
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:02.448
But we work through it.

825
00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:07.379
I just need
him to come back.

826
00:38:07.482 --> 00:38:09.793
Y'all two always pull through.

827
00:38:09.896 --> 00:38:12.137
You know. his ego might
be bruised a little bit.

828
00:38:12.241 --> 00:38:13.689
but he gonna call you.

829
00:38:13.793 --> 00:38:15.310
He ain't stupid.

830
00:38:15.413 --> 00:38:17.000
That part.

831
00:38:38.965 --> 00:38:42.551
Hello. Carmen?

832
00:38:42.655 --> 00:38:44.517
CARMEN
Yes. this is she.

833
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.896
This is Marc's wife.

834
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.965
Oh. I didn't expect to
hear from you so soon.

835
00:38:51.068 --> 00:38:53.172
Have you seen my husband?

836
00:38:53.275 --> 00:38:55.310
Is he with you?

837
00:38:55.413 --> 00:38:57.137
Oh. hold on 1 second.

838
00:38:57.241 --> 00:38:57.965
Hey. Marc.

839
00:38:58.068 --> 00:38:59.448
Are you here?

840
00:38:59.551 --> 00:39:03.827
Marc. are you-- are you there?

841
00:39:03.931 --> 00:39:06.310
Look. I don't have
time for games. OK?

842
00:39:06.413 --> 00:39:07.931
This is serious.

843
00:39:08.034 --> 00:39:09.724
CARMEN Look. I don't
have time for you questioning

844
00:39:09.827 --> 00:39:12.379
me about a husband
that you clearly do

845
00:39:12.482 --> 00:39:14.000
not know how to take care of.

846
00:39:14.103 --> 00:39:15.413
Bitch.

847
00:39:15.517 --> 00:39:16.758
You don't know what I
know how to take care of.

848
00:39:16.862 --> 00:39:19.689
Your marital problems
are not my problems. OK?

849
00:39:19.793 --> 00:39:20.620
Bitch!

850
00:39:29.827 --> 00:39:32.896
Mrs. Carter. I'm
Detective McKenzie.

851
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.724
Thank you.

852
00:39:33.827 --> 00:39:35.068
Hi.

853
00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:36.793
This is Detective Anderson.

854
00:39:36.896 --> 00:39:37.724
Hello.

855
00:39:40.965 --> 00:39:42.965
So your husband. Marc
Carter. is missing?

856
00:39:43.068 --> 00:39:44.206
Yes.

857
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:48.965
I haven't seen him or
spoken to him in two days.

858
00:39:49.068 --> 00:39:53.862
No one else has heard from
him. not even his mother.

859
00:39:53.965 --> 00:39:56.034
Well. it says here that he
owns a boat and it's missing.

860
00:39:56.137 --> 00:39:57.068
too.

861
00:39:57.172 --> 00:39:58.724
Perhaps he's just taken a trip.

862
00:39:58.827 --> 00:40:00.379
No.

863
00:40:00.482 --> 00:40:02.103
Something's wrong.

864
00:40:02.206 --> 00:40:06.793
OK. one thing I know about
my husband. he's consistent.

865
00:40:06.896 --> 00:40:08.620
He wouldn't just
leave his company.

866
00:40:11.241 --> 00:40:13.275
His company is everything.

867
00:40:13.379 --> 00:40:14.551
OK. Mrs. Carter.

868
00:40:14.655 --> 00:40:15.965
Why don't we start
with a list of people

869
00:40:16.068 --> 00:40:17.931
that we should contact. a
description of the boat.

870
00:40:18.034 --> 00:40:20.206
and we can put out a
missing persons bulletin.

871
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:21.137
OK?

872
00:40:31.689 --> 00:40:33.206
What do you think?

873
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:35.379
Well. I'm pretty certain that
a highly successful man doesn't

874
00:40:35.482 --> 00:40:37.551
just vanish into thin air.

875
00:40:37.655 --> 00:40:39.965
Let's start with
the missing boat.

876
00:40:40.068 --> 00:40:40.896
I'm with you.

877
00:40:46.517 --> 00:40:47.517
This doesn't make any sense.

878
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.103
Marc would never just disappear.

879
00:40:49.206 --> 00:40:50.413
I know.

880
00:40:50.517 --> 00:40:52.827
Well. what did Toni
say when she called you?

881
00:40:52.931 --> 00:40:55.793
That Marc hadn't been seen
since the night of the party.

882
00:40:55.896 --> 00:40:58.137
What took her so long
to call the police?

883
00:40:58.241 --> 00:40:59.172
I don't know.

884
00:40:59.275 --> 00:41:00.034
I don't believe her.

885
00:41:00.137 --> 00:41:00.931
She's lying.

886
00:41:01.034 --> 00:41:02.241
London. please!

887
00:41:02.344 --> 00:41:03.758
Mom. you know that
she's a nutcase.

888
00:41:03.862 --> 00:41:06.137
I wouldn't put
anything past her.

889
00:41:06.241 --> 00:41:06.965
Come on.

890
00:41:07.068 --> 00:41:07.620
Calm down.

891
00:41:07.724 --> 00:41:08.827
I'm just saying.

892
00:41:13.551 --> 00:41:14.793
McKenzie.

893
00:41:14.896 --> 00:41:15.931
Yeah.

894
00:41:16.034 --> 00:41:17.137
What?

895
00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:17.965
You found the boat?

896
00:41:18.068 --> 00:41:19.965
Where?

897
00:41:20.068 --> 00:41:21.379
Chesapeake Marina?

898
00:41:21.482 --> 00:41:22.965
All right. I'll be right there.

899
00:41:32.275 --> 00:41:33.034
Come on. baby.

900
00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:35.551
Answer. please.

901
00:41:35.655 --> 00:41:37.000
I don't know what's going on.

902
00:41:39.517 --> 00:41:40.275
Toni.

903
00:41:40.379 --> 00:41:41.620
Victor.

904
00:41:41.724 --> 00:41:44.137
I don't know what to do.

905
00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:47.034
It's been days.

906
00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:48.241
Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

907
00:41:48.344 --> 00:41:49.206
It's OK.

908
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.206
It's OK.

909
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:54.034
It's gonna be OK.

910
00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:55.655
Sorry.

911
00:41:55.758 --> 00:41:57.413
I didn't mean for you
to see me like this.

912
00:41:57.517 --> 00:41:58.241
It's OK.

913
00:41:58.344 --> 00:41:59.172
It's OK.

914
00:42:11.517 --> 00:42:12.551
This view is so gorgeous.

915
00:42:15.517 --> 00:42:19.758
I remember when Marc first found
this place. how happy he was.

916
00:42:19.862 --> 00:42:21.413
Hmm.

917
00:42:21.517 --> 00:42:23.344
Yeah. I remember when
he was telling me

918
00:42:23.448 --> 00:42:26.862
he wanted a place of serenity.

919
00:42:26.965 --> 00:42:30.655
And then he found this place.

920
00:42:30.758 --> 00:42:31.931
And it was perfect.

921
00:42:37.586 --> 00:42:41.068
Hey. uh. the detectives
are back at the house.

922
00:42:41.172 --> 00:42:42.034
Do they have any news?

923
00:42:42.137 --> 00:42:42.862
I-- I don't know.

924
00:42:42.965 --> 00:42:44.724
I came right out to get you.

925
00:42:44.827 --> 00:42:45.862
Come on. let's go.

926
00:42:52.827 --> 00:42:56.965
Detective McKenzie.
did you find Marc?

927
00:42:57.068 --> 00:42:57.793
Toni. honey.

928
00:42:57.896 --> 00:42:59.206
I need you to come sit down.

929
00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.344
- Why?
- It--

930
00:43:00.448 --> 00:43:01.206
Why?

931
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.103
What's wrong?

932
00:43:05.241 --> 00:43:06.620
Who-- who are you?

933
00:43:06.724 --> 00:43:08.241
I'm Detective Anderson.

934
00:43:08.344 --> 00:43:11.758
And we found your husband's boat
about 25 miles from your house.

935
00:43:11.862 --> 00:43:13.448
It was docked at the
Chesapeake Marina.

936
00:43:13.551 --> 00:43:14.310
Yeah?

937
00:43:14.413 --> 00:43:17.275
Where is he?

938
00:43:17.379 --> 00:43:20.103
Mrs. Carter. a body
washed up on the shore.

939
00:43:20.206 --> 00:43:22.344
and we've confirmed it
is indeed your husband.

940
00:43:22.448 --> 00:43:23.379
No!

941
00:43:23.482 --> 00:43:26.655
No. no. no. no. no. no. no!

942
00:43:26.758 --> 00:43:28.172
No. you're lying!

943
00:43:28.275 --> 00:43:29.689
No!

944
00:43:29.793 --> 00:43:31.034
You did this.

945
00:43:31.137 --> 00:43:33.655
No. no. no. no!

946
00:43:33.758 --> 00:43:36.172
You killed my brother!

947
00:43:36.275 --> 00:43:37.344
Ugh!

948
00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:38.758
I loved Marc!

949
00:43:38.862 --> 00:43:40.068
You stupid bitch!

950
00:43:40.172 --> 00:43:41.413
You stupid bitch!

951
00:43:41.517 --> 00:43:42.586
Stop.

952
00:43:42.689 --> 00:43:44.103
You only wanted
him for his money!

953
00:43:44.206 --> 00:43:44.931
- Stop.

954
00:43:45.034 --> 00:43:45.862
His money!

955
00:43:49.379 --> 00:43:51.620
No. I didn't.

956
00:45:00.379 --> 00:45:10.517
I want to
live so God can use me.

957
00:45:15.344 --> 00:45:26.931
I want to live so
God can use me.

958
00:45:31.896 --> 00:45:41.586
Any time. any-- any way--

959
00:45:41.689 --> 00:45:43.793
Goodbye. little bro.

960
00:45:43.896 --> 00:45:46.620
You'll forever be in my heart.

961
00:45:46.724 --> 00:45:51.172
Oh. my
Lord. I want to live.

962
00:45:51.275 --> 00:45:59.689
I want to live so
God can use me.

963
00:45:59.793 --> 00:46:01.103
Anybody want to live?

964
00:46:03.724 --> 00:46:05.862
Any time--

965
00:46:05.965 --> 00:46:07.379
Check this out.

966
00:46:07.482 --> 00:46:10.034
Autopsy confirms homicide.

967
00:46:10.137 --> 00:46:12.482
Question is. who had motive?

968
00:46:12.586 --> 00:46:13.896
I mean. the guy was rich.

969
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
I'm sure he pissed
a few people off.

970
00:46:16.103 --> 00:46:17.931
OK. so the primary
people we start with

971
00:46:18.034 --> 00:46:22.137
are the wife. business
partner. and the sister.

972
00:46:22.241 --> 00:46:24.103
But only because
she had money ties.

973
00:46:24.206 --> 00:46:25.586
Yeah. but Marc
Carter was a man

974
00:46:25.689 --> 00:46:26.620
of means with expensive taste.

975
00:46:26.724 --> 00:46:27.965
Mm-hmm.

976
00:46:28.068 --> 00:46:29.413
I'd be very surprised
if he didn't have more

977
00:46:29.517 --> 00:46:31.103
mistresses than Carmen here.

978
00:46:31.206 --> 00:46:33.034
Mistresses have
been known to kill.

979
00:46:33.137 --> 00:46:37.172
Yeah. but fortunately for this
eyepiece. her alibi checks out.

980
00:46:37.275 --> 00:46:37.862
OK.

981
00:46:37.965 --> 00:46:38.689
So what do we got?

982
00:46:38.793 --> 00:46:40.275
We got love.

983
00:46:40.379 --> 00:46:41.137
Mm-hmm.

984
00:46:41.241 --> 00:46:41.758
Money.

985
00:46:41.862 --> 00:46:42.689
And what?

986
00:46:42.793 --> 00:46:44.344
Possible jealousy?

987
00:46:44.448 --> 00:46:46.034
Which means they
all have motives.

988
00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:46.896
Right.

989
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.310
So where do you want to start?

990
00:46:49.413 --> 00:46:50.310
Hmm.

991
00:46:50.413 --> 00:46:51.689
I'll start with
the company first.

992
00:46:51.793 --> 00:46:53.000
- Yeah.
- See what I find.

993
00:46:59.172 --> 00:47:01.344
What about Mr.
Carter as a person?

994
00:47:01.448 --> 00:47:03.551
Were you two close?

995
00:47:03.655 --> 00:47:05.448
He had a lot of admirers.

996
00:47:05.551 --> 00:47:06.655
I just wasn't one of them.

997
00:47:06.758 --> 00:47:07.931
And not like that.

998
00:47:08.034 --> 00:47:08.931
He was my boss.

999
00:47:09.034 --> 00:47:10.482
He was my mentor.

1000
00:47:10.586 --> 00:47:12.241
That's it.

1001
00:47:12.344 --> 00:47:17.965
The last time I talked to Marc
was at the anniversary party.

1002
00:47:18.068 --> 00:47:19.931
We had a little
disagreement. and I

1003
00:47:20.034 --> 00:47:21.517
stepped away to grab a drink.

1004
00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:27.310
Witnesses at the party
say it was pretty intense.

1005
00:47:27.413 --> 00:47:31.931
"Intense" is such a
strong word. Detective.

1006
00:47:32.034 --> 00:47:34.724
More like. had a
little heat to it.

1007
00:47:34.827 --> 00:47:39.310
So what was the
disagreement about?

1008
00:47:39.413 --> 00:47:40.413
Just business.

1009
00:47:40.517 --> 00:47:42.793
So these admirers
of his. did he ever

1010
00:47:42.896 --> 00:47:44.724
get involved with any of them?

1011
00:47:44.827 --> 00:47:47.034
Mr. Carter loved women.

1012
00:47:47.137 --> 00:47:51.275
I hated it for Toni. because
she really loved him.

1013
00:47:51.379 --> 00:47:54.068
He just treated her
like some status symbol.

1014
00:47:54.172 --> 00:47:56.827
Is it true that you and
Marc weren't on the same page

1015
00:47:56.931 --> 00:47:58.827
about selling Holden Gaming?

1016
00:47:58.931 --> 00:48:00.310
We were in discussions.

1017
00:48:00.413 --> 00:48:02.344
Well. from my understanding.
there was $200 million

1018
00:48:02.448 --> 00:48:04.551
on the line that Marc
was shooting down.

1019
00:48:04.655 --> 00:48:10.379
Now. Victor. that's a
lot of money to lose.

1020
00:48:10.482 --> 00:48:13.896
I don't like what you're
insinuating. Detective.

1021
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.310
Just make your point.

1022
00:48:15.413 --> 00:48:17.344
Well. I'm just doing
my due diligence. Victor.

1023
00:48:17.448 --> 00:48:19.448
And to be frank. you're
one of the people

1024
00:48:19.551 --> 00:48:21.793
who had the most to gain
from Mr. Carter's death.

1025
00:48:21.896 --> 00:48:23.758
Marc and I were best friends.

1026
00:48:23.862 --> 00:48:25.344
We started this
business from scratch.

1027
00:48:25.448 --> 00:48:29.206
Yet you argued
about selling it.

1028
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:32.379
Was Mrs. Carter aware of
any of these indiscretions?

1029
00:48:32.482 --> 00:48:33.241
We all knew.

1030
00:48:33.344 --> 00:48:35.862
It-- it was an open secret.

1031
00:48:35.965 --> 00:48:37.379
I remember she came
in one day. and she

1032
00:48:37.482 --> 00:48:40.793
was screaming about some
email that she'd found.

1033
00:48:40.896 --> 00:48:41.827
The whole office heard her.

1034
00:48:41.931 --> 00:48:42.793
The walls were shaking.

1035
00:48:42.896 --> 00:48:44.931
Really?

1036
00:48:45.034 --> 00:48:46.965
How long ago was this?

1037
00:48:47.068 --> 00:48:48.413
Maybe a year ago.

1038
00:48:48.517 --> 00:48:51.482
But nothing like that
has happened since.

1039
00:48:51.586 --> 00:48:54.689
Marc got into arguments with
a lot of different people.

1040
00:48:54.793 --> 00:48:55.724
He was stubborn like that.

1041
00:48:55.827 --> 00:48:58.206
That's just who he was.

1042
00:48:58.310 --> 00:48:59.931
Now. five minutes
after I stepped away.

1043
00:49:00.034 --> 00:49:02.827
Toni was coming at him
about something else.

1044
00:49:02.931 --> 00:49:05.724
So from your point of view.
how was the business doing?

1045
00:49:05.827 --> 00:49:07.137
It was good.

1046
00:49:07.241 --> 00:49:10.344
We doubled the company's
revenue in the last year.

1047
00:49:10.448 --> 00:49:12.862
I don't know what we're
gonna do now that he's gone.

1048
00:49:12.965 --> 00:49:14.206
One last question.

1049
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:15.793
Where were you00 AM.
the night of the party?

1050
00:49:15.896 --> 00:49:21.586
I was at home. making love
to my beautiful fiancée.

1051
00:49:21.689 --> 00:49:22.827
Really?

1052
00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:23.862
Any more questions?

1053
00:49:23.965 --> 00:49:26.310
Well. thank you for your time.

1054
00:49:32.896 --> 00:49:35.172
Sorry. Denver.

1055
00:49:35.275 --> 00:49:36.896
Had to get myself together.

1056
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.034
No problem.

1057
00:49:38.137 --> 00:49:40.310
Sorry for the. uh. short notice.

1058
00:49:40.413 --> 00:49:44.241
I just needed to get
everyone under one roof.

1059
00:49:44.344 --> 00:49:47.517
OK. let's get started.

1060
00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.137
"I. Marc Devon Carter.
being of sound mind.

1061
00:49:50.241 --> 00:49:52.724
do hereby declare this
document to be my last will

1062
00:49:52.827 --> 00:49:56.068
and testament. and hereby
revoke any and all other wills

1063
00:49:56.172 --> 00:49:58.413
heretofore made by me.

1064
00:49:58.517 --> 00:50:02.379
I appoint Denver Lawson to serve
as the personal representative

1065
00:50:02.482 --> 00:50:05.689
of my estate. and he will work
directly with my wife. Toni

1066
00:50:05.793 --> 00:50:08.379
Kathleen Carter. to make all
business decisions pertaining

1067
00:50:08.482 --> 00:50:12.482
to my business properties and
finances totaling $25 million.

1068
00:50:12.586 --> 00:50:17.137
If for any reason Toni Carter is
deemed unfit to make decisions.

1069
00:50:17.241 --> 00:50:19.379
Denver will serve as the
conservator of the estate

1070
00:50:19.482 --> 00:50:21.689
and Toni's rights
will temporarily pass

1071
00:50:21.793 --> 00:50:24.103
to my mother. Doris Carter."

1072
00:50:24.206 --> 00:50:25.413
Wait a minute.

1073
00:50:25.517 --> 00:50:27.034
So you're saying if
Toni is deemed crazy.

1074
00:50:27.137 --> 00:50:28.827
Mom makes the
decision in her place?

1075
00:50:28.931 --> 00:50:31.034
London. stop.

1076
00:50:31.137 --> 00:50:33.413
Is that what you want. London?

1077
00:50:33.517 --> 00:50:36.137
You and your mom
to run my estate?

1078
00:50:36.241 --> 00:50:37.275
Marc's estate.

1079
00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:39.482
Ladies. please.

1080
00:50:39.586 --> 00:50:42.965
I'll be glad to answer any
questions once I've finished.

1081
00:50:43.068 --> 00:50:45.413
Uh. wait. wait. wait. wait.

1082
00:50:45.517 --> 00:50:49.034
Um. what's this here on page 6?

1083
00:50:49.137 --> 00:50:52.034
About a holding period
before we can even begin

1084
00:50:52.137 --> 00:50:53.655
discussions on selling Holden?

1085
00:50:53.758 --> 00:50:57.206
So there's a 60 day holding
period after death in which

1086
00:50:57.310 --> 00:50:59.241
the company cannot be sold.

1087
00:50:59.344 --> 00:51:02.137
After that time. if Miss
Carter is interested.

1088
00:51:02.241 --> 00:51:04.310
then you can enter
into negotiations

1089
00:51:04.413 --> 00:51:07.344
regarding sale of the company.

1090
00:51:07.448 --> 00:51:09.275
So I need both of
their signatures?

1091
00:51:09.379 --> 00:51:10.931
That is correct.

1092
00:51:11.034 --> 00:51:13.793
I'm just here to act
on Marc's wishes.

1093
00:51:13.896 --> 00:51:16.827
Don't shoot the messenger.

1094
00:51:16.931 --> 00:51:18.275
Ahem.

1095
00:51:18.379 --> 00:51:20.793
Toni. there are parties
interested in buying holding

1096
00:51:20.896 --> 00:51:24.275
for a minimum of $200 million.

1097
00:51:24.379 --> 00:51:27.931
I'm not ready. Victor.

1098
00:51:28.034 --> 00:51:30.068
Marc just died. for God's sake.

1099
00:51:30.172 --> 00:51:30.931
He didn't die.

1100
00:51:31.034 --> 00:51:31.965
He was murdered.

1101
00:51:32.068 --> 00:51:33.275
At least get that part straight.

1102
00:51:33.379 --> 00:51:35.689
Bitch. you got one
more time to try me.

1103
00:51:35.793 --> 00:51:37.137
Toni. baby. listen.

1104
00:51:37.241 --> 00:51:39.758
We know you've been
dealing with mental issues.

1105
00:51:39.862 --> 00:51:42.862
Maybe you should consider
letting me handle my business

1106
00:51:42.965 --> 00:51:44.689
until you get better.

1107
00:51:44.793 --> 00:51:49.068
I've been running the business
behind the scenes for years.

1108
00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:50.862
I know what I'm doing.

1109
00:51:50.965 --> 00:51:53.724
Oh. now the gold-digger thinks
she knows what she's doing.

1110
00:51:53.827 --> 00:51:55.620
Gold-digger?

1111
00:51:55.724 --> 00:51:56.896
Let me tell you something.

1112
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.068
Oh. here we go.

1113
00:51:58.172 --> 00:52:00.413
You never respected
me as his wife.

1114
00:52:00.517 --> 00:52:03.034
You always want him to
choose between me and you.

1115
00:52:03.137 --> 00:52:06.137
And he chose me. his wife.

1116
00:52:06.241 --> 00:52:08.896
And if it wasn't
for me honoring him.

1117
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.448
I would completely cut you out.

1118
00:52:12.551 --> 00:52:13.344
Toni. look.

1119
00:52:13.448 --> 00:52:15.068
I didn't mean anything by it.

1120
00:52:15.172 --> 00:52:16.310
I just wanted to
make sure you were

1121
00:52:16.413 --> 00:52:19.103
well enough to handle things.

1122
00:52:19.206 --> 00:52:21.275
Miss Doris. I'm fine.

1123
00:52:21.379 --> 00:52:25.241
I will not be
relinquishing my rights.

1124
00:52:25.344 --> 00:52:27.448
And I know Marc left you
completely taken care of.

1125
00:52:27.551 --> 00:52:29.517
So I suggest you take
whatever he gave you

1126
00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:33.034
and leave me the hell alone.

1127
00:52:33.137 --> 00:52:36.206
Now. I'm gonna leave before I
say something I might regret.

1128
00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:38.068
And the rest of you
can see your way out.

1129
00:52:38.172 --> 00:52:39.724
We'll handle this
tomorrow. Mr. Lawson.

1130
00:52:43.758 --> 00:52:47.517
Toni's beginning to give
us some real problems.

1131
00:52:47.620 --> 00:52:49.517
And you were supposed
to be working on her.

1132
00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:51.896
That is easier said than done.

1133
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.482
She is a mess over Marc.

1134
00:52:53.586 --> 00:52:55.137
I'm afraid she's gonna have
another blackout or something.

1135
00:52:55.241 --> 00:52:56.862
Yeah. well. you
need to figure it out.

1136
00:52:56.965 --> 00:52:58.344
And fast.

1137
00:52:58.448 --> 00:52:59.275
Or we gonna lose this deal.

1138
00:52:59.379 --> 00:53:02.206
And I'm not having that.

1139
00:53:13.655 --> 00:53:15.896
I've been trying
to get away from this

1140
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.172
company and Marc for years.

1141
00:53:18.275 --> 00:53:21.241
And even from the grave. he's
still making it hard for me!

1142
00:53:21.344 --> 00:53:23.241
What exactly do
you want me to do?

1143
00:53:23.344 --> 00:53:26.862
I want you to play
your damn position!

1144
00:53:26.965 --> 00:53:28.103
All right?

1145
00:53:28.206 --> 00:53:29.413
Either get Toni on
board with selling.

1146
00:53:29.517 --> 00:53:31.413
or get her fully committed.

1147
00:53:36.586 --> 00:53:41.310
I know if you get
Toni committed.

1148
00:53:41.413 --> 00:53:42.827
I can get Miss Doris on board.

1149
00:53:46.551 --> 00:53:49.413
And all you need is
Toni and Denver to sign?

1150
00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:54.758
Yeah.

1151
00:53:54.862 --> 00:53:55.689
Yeah. that's it.

1152
00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.517
I think I can make
something happen. if you

1153
00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:07.275
can get Miss Doris to sign.

1154
00:54:07.379 --> 00:54:08.448
Oh. I will.

1155
00:54:11.172 --> 00:54:13.068
Then we'll be $200
million richer.

1156
00:54:13.172 --> 00:54:13.896
Come here. girl.

1157
00:54:23.034 --> 00:54:25.068
August Washington?

1158
00:54:25.172 --> 00:54:26.103
Who's asking?

1159
00:54:26.206 --> 00:54:27.586
My name is Detective McKenzie.

1160
00:54:27.689 --> 00:54:30.551
I'm investigating the
murder of Marc Carter.

1161
00:54:30.655 --> 00:54:34.137
You have a moment
to speak with me?

1162
00:54:34.241 --> 00:54:36.551
Yeah. sure.

1163
00:54:36.655 --> 00:54:39.931
When was the last time
you saw the deceased?

1164
00:54:40.034 --> 00:54:41.379
At the anniversary party.

1165
00:54:41.482 --> 00:54:42.793
But it wasn't for long.

1166
00:54:42.896 --> 00:54:43.931
I had to leave early.

1167
00:54:44.034 --> 00:54:46.206
You have anyone who
can back up your alibi?

1168
00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:48.793
I do.

1169
00:54:48.896 --> 00:54:50.137
Do you know anyone
who would have

1170
00:54:50.241 --> 00:54:52.241
wanted to see Mr. Carter dead?

1171
00:54:52.344 --> 00:54:53.137
Man. I'm-- I'm--

1172
00:54:53.241 --> 00:54:54.241
I'm just a landscaper.

1173
00:54:54.344 --> 00:54:55.068
All right.

1174
00:54:55.172 --> 00:54:55.896
I mind my business.

1175
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:56.827
I do my job.

1176
00:54:56.931 --> 00:54:58.137
And Mr. Carter--

1177
00:54:58.241 --> 00:55:01.517
I'm sorry-- the deceased.
paid me on time.

1178
00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:02.965
OK.

1179
00:55:03.068 --> 00:55:07.448
But if you think of anything
else. please. give me a call.

1180
00:55:07.551 --> 00:55:08.586
Absolutely will.

1181
00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:17.034
Ahem.

1182
00:55:17.137 --> 00:55:18.793
Mm-mm.

1183
00:55:18.896 --> 00:55:22.275
The last time I mixed alcohol
with my meds. it was bad.

1184
00:55:22.379 --> 00:55:23.724
Well. that's the point.

1185
00:55:23.827 --> 00:55:25.655
After the week you had.
you deserve a little drink.

1186
00:55:25.758 --> 00:55:27.068
A little wine ain't
gonna hurt nothing.

1187
00:55:27.172 --> 00:55:28.137
No.

1188
00:55:28.241 --> 00:55:29.034
OK.

1189
00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:36.103
Victor told me the reading of
the will got a little rough.

1190
00:55:36.206 --> 00:55:38.206
Especially with
that bitch. London.

1191
00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:40.344
I can't stand her.

1192
00:55:40.448 --> 00:55:42.137
Have you spoken to your doctor?

1193
00:55:42.241 --> 00:55:43.344
Yeah.

1194
00:55:43.448 --> 00:55:45.896
I speak to him every day.

1195
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:46.758
He gave me sleeping pills.

1196
00:55:46.862 --> 00:55:48.551
It makes me feel like a zombie.

1197
00:55:48.655 --> 00:55:52.551
Then I got Victor pressuring me
about selling Marc's company.

1198
00:55:52.655 --> 00:55:54.448
I mean. if Marc were alive.
I'd probably be begging

1199
00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:55.586
him to sell the company.

1200
00:55:55.689 --> 00:56:02.862
But I-- he's not.
and I need time.

1201
00:56:02.965 --> 00:56:06.379
Look. if you sell. you
can get a fresh start.

1202
00:56:06.482 --> 00:56:08.689
You don't owe nobody
no explanations

1203
00:56:08.793 --> 00:56:10.448
for doing what's best for you.

1204
00:56:10.551 --> 00:56:12.034
Aren't you a piece of work?

1205
00:56:12.137 --> 00:56:13.206
Speak of the damn devil.

1206
00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:14.758
What are you
doing in my house?

1207
00:56:14.862 --> 00:56:16.931
I see you still plotting
how to get even more money out

1208
00:56:17.034 --> 00:56:17.793
of my dead brother.

1209
00:56:17.896 --> 00:56:19.206
Get the hell out of my house.

1210
00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:20.655
I know you killed him.

1211
00:56:20.758 --> 00:56:22.551
And I'm not gonna stop
until your ass is locked up!

1212
00:56:22.655 --> 00:56:24.448
I didn't kill
nobody. but I do know

1213
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:25.413
you better get out my house!

1214
00:56:25.517 --> 00:56:26.724
Or what?

1215
00:56:26.827 --> 00:56:28.034
Listen. you got a
lot of nerve coming up

1216
00:56:28.137 --> 00:56:29.000
in here accusing Toni.

1217
00:56:29.103 --> 00:56:30.034
She loved Marc.

1218
00:56:30.137 --> 00:56:31.241
Please. she loved his money!

1219
00:56:31.344 --> 00:56:32.517
Oh. and you didn't?

1220
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.068
Weren't you always
begging him for a loan.

1221
00:56:34.172 --> 00:56:35.586
begging him for some money.
get your damn hair braided?

1222
00:56:35.689 --> 00:56:36.862
You don't know
nothing about me!

1223
00:56:36.965 --> 00:56:38.448
- We know you ain't got no hair.
- Shut up!

1224
00:56:38.551 --> 00:56:39.275
I know you a leech.

1225
00:56:39.379 --> 00:56:40.448
That's what I know.

1226
00:56:40.551 --> 00:56:41.896
And I know the only
reason Marc ever

1227
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.586
gave you anything is
because he felt sorry

1228
00:56:43.689 --> 00:56:45.000
for your little pathetic ass!

1229
00:56:45.103 --> 00:56:47.103
You're pathetic.
pining for a man that had

1230
00:56:47.206 --> 00:56:48.517
a vasectomy behind your back.

1231
00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.206
He was never gonna have
kids with your crazy ass!

1232
00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:51.034
What?

1233
00:56:51.137 --> 00:56:52.000
Bitch. slow down.

1234
00:56:53.206 --> 00:56:53.931
Hey!

1235
00:56:54.034 --> 00:56:56.206
Wait. wait!

1236
00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:57.103
You stupid bitch!

1237
00:56:57.206 --> 00:56:58.137
You cut me!

1238
00:57:02.896 --> 00:57:03.724
Toni.

1239
00:57:13.344 --> 00:57:14.172
Toni?

1240
00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:18.275
Toni. I'm gonna
have to call 911.

1241
00:57:18.379 --> 00:57:19.551
We can figure this out.

1242
00:57:30.517 --> 00:57:34.275
Toni. it's OK.

1243
00:57:34.379 --> 00:57:35.241
You're safe.

1244
00:57:35.344 --> 00:57:36.931
You're safe.

1245
00:57:37.034 --> 00:57:38.344
Where am I?

1246
00:57:38.448 --> 00:57:40.724
When I got the call. I had
them bring you here. to the New

1247
00:57:40.827 --> 00:57:42.448
Haven Mental Facility.

1248
00:57:42.551 --> 00:57:43.655
What?

1249
00:57:43.758 --> 00:57:45.068
What's the last
thing you remember?

1250
00:57:48.275 --> 00:57:51.275
Um. I remember having lunch.

1251
00:57:51.379 --> 00:57:54.310
And London showed up.

1252
00:57:54.413 --> 00:57:55.379
And--

1253
00:57:55.482 --> 00:57:57.517
Do you remember anything else?

1254
00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:58.724
No. I must have--

1255
00:57:58.827 --> 00:58:00.068
I must have blacked out.

1256
00:58:00.172 --> 00:58:02.931
Where-- why-- why are
my hands in restraints?

1257
00:58:03.034 --> 00:58:05.068
Last night. you attacked your
sister-in-law with a knife.

1258
00:58:05.172 --> 00:58:05.896
No.

1259
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.172
No. I didn't.

1260
00:58:07.275 --> 00:58:08.551
I did not-- Let me out of here.
Get me out of here!

1261
00:58:08.655 --> 00:58:09.896
It's OK.
It's OK.

1262
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.034
What do you mean. it's OK?
Let me out.

1263
00:58:11.137 --> 00:58:12.689
Everything is
gonna be fine. OK?

1264
00:58:12.793 --> 00:58:14.068
We're just going to have
one of the nurses give you--

1265
00:58:14.172 --> 00:58:15.103
- No!
- Hold her down.

1266
00:58:15.206 --> 00:58:15.793
No!

1267
00:58:15.896 --> 00:58:16.620
Give her the shot.

1268
00:58:16.724 --> 00:58:17.344
Go ahead. go ahead.

1269
00:58:29.896 --> 00:58:31.379
Doctor. thanks for
coming down tonight.

1270
00:58:31.482 --> 00:58:32.241
Of course.

1271
00:58:32.344 --> 00:58:33.275
Don't mention it.

1272
00:58:33.379 --> 00:58:36.068
So how is Mrs. Carter feeling?

1273
00:58:36.172 --> 00:58:38.793
She's fragile.

1274
00:58:38.896 --> 00:58:40.275
I mean. she doesn't
remember the incident.

1275
00:58:40.379 --> 00:58:42.758
but with time she will.

1276
00:58:42.862 --> 00:58:43.931
Hmm.

1277
00:58:44.034 --> 00:58:46.172
So what can you tell me
about her state of mind

1278
00:58:46.275 --> 00:58:47.586
before the incident?

1279
00:58:47.689 --> 00:58:49.758
Miss Carter suffers from
depression and anxiety.

1280
00:58:49.862 --> 00:58:51.206
which is not uncommon.

1281
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:54.379
But it is uncommon to
attack someone with a knife.

1282
00:58:54.482 --> 00:58:57.482
Well for someone like Toni.
who lives this perfect life

1283
00:58:57.586 --> 00:59:01.137
in the public eye. to deal with
the deep pain that she carries

1284
00:59:01.241 --> 00:59:02.965
can be overwhelming.

1285
00:59:03.068 --> 00:59:04.620
Now. in the past
she has resorted

1286
00:59:04.724 --> 00:59:06.689
to cutting as a means
to ease the pain

1287
00:59:06.793 --> 00:59:08.758
and gain back a
sense of control.

1288
00:59:08.862 --> 00:59:11.206
Well. has she ever
attacked anyone before?

1289
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.827
You know. become violent?

1290
00:59:12.931 --> 00:59:14.310
Not to my knowledge.

1291
00:59:14.413 --> 00:59:16.862
She's much more likely
to engage in self-harm.

1292
00:59:16.965 --> 00:59:19.241
Now. the incident with
her sister-in-law. that

1293
00:59:19.344 --> 00:59:21.000
was an extreme response.

1294
00:59:21.103 --> 00:59:23.620
Doctor. I'm gonna have
to speak with Mrs. Carter.

1295
00:59:23.724 --> 00:59:25.206
ask her some questions.

1296
00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:26.793
When she's more stable. we
could definitely arrange that.

1297
00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:29.241
Dr. Franklin. this is
a murder investigation.

1298
00:59:29.344 --> 00:59:32.896
I understand. but my duty
is to my patient first.

1299
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.241
It's important that
I keep the stresses

1300
00:59:35.344 --> 00:59:37.137
around Toni down to a minimum.

1301
00:59:37.241 --> 00:59:40.241
We do that. then I think we'll
be able to take questions.

1302
00:59:48.793 --> 00:59:51.413
Can't believe you got
her fully committee.

1303
00:59:51.517 --> 00:59:52.517
What was I supposed to do?

1304
00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.379
She tried to kill herself.

1305
00:59:54.482 --> 00:59:57.931
I'm actually scared for her.

1306
00:59:58.034 --> 01:00:01.655
So maybe you should
have let her die.

1307
01:00:01.758 --> 01:00:05.000
I mean. that way I'd be
able to sell the company.

1308
01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:06.551
I can't believe
you just said that.

1309
01:00:06.655 --> 01:00:09.344
It's true.

1310
01:00:09.448 --> 01:00:10.172
It's true. OK?

1311
01:00:10.275 --> 01:00:11.206
OK?

1312
01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:13.448
Getting her committed
is not enough.

1313
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:16.068
She hasn't been
deemed incapable.

1314
01:00:16.172 --> 01:00:17.586
I need her rights
to the company.

1315
01:00:17.689 --> 01:00:18.931
What do you want me to do?

1316
01:00:19.034 --> 01:00:20.724
I already got her put in!

1317
01:00:25.793 --> 01:00:27.000
You know what you need to do.

1318
01:00:29.931 --> 01:00:32.137
I'm not making
you no promises.

1319
01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:35.241
I can't convince people to do
things they don't want to do.

1320
01:00:35.344 --> 01:00:36.275
Figure it out!

1321
01:00:38.551 --> 01:00:40.655
Because if you don't do whatever
you've got to do to get them

1322
01:00:40.758 --> 01:00:46.517
signatures. I'll
tell your best friend

1323
01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:50.827
that you were sleeping with
her husband behind her back.

1324
01:00:50.931 --> 01:00:51.965
You're an asshole.

1325
01:00:54.275 --> 01:00:55.068
Yeah.

1326
01:00:58.724 --> 01:01:00.758
Yeah. but what would
you be without me?

1327
01:01:06.137 --> 01:01:07.793
Drive.

1328
01:01:12.862 --> 01:01:14.517
Hey. Miss Doris.

1329
01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:15.896
It's so good to see you.

1330
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.241
Come on in. Victor.

1331
01:01:19.344 --> 01:01:20.172
How are you?

1332
01:01:20.275 --> 01:01:21.103
All right.

1333
01:01:29.586 --> 01:01:31.689
Uh. is-- is London around?

1334
01:01:31.793 --> 01:01:33.586
No. she stepped out.

1335
01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:34.827
What's on your mind?

1336
01:01:37.655 --> 01:01:39.241
Um. look. I--

1337
01:01:39.344 --> 01:01:43.620
I know you must feel angry at
the way Toni came at London.

1338
01:01:43.724 --> 01:01:46.241
but I'm really
worried about her.

1339
01:01:46.344 --> 01:01:50.034
It would break Marc's
heart. seeing them like that.

1340
01:01:50.137 --> 01:01:54.931
I remember when
Holden first blew up.

1341
01:01:55.034 --> 01:01:57.551
Marc made me promise
him that if anything

1342
01:01:57.655 --> 01:01:59.758
ever happened to him. that--

1343
01:01:59.862 --> 01:02:02.896
to make sure that his
family was taken care of.

1344
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.034
Now. I can't help
Toni. but I can make

1345
01:02:05.137 --> 01:02:07.931
sure you and London are OK.

1346
01:02:08.034 --> 01:02:10.758
What do you mean?

1347
01:02:10.862 --> 01:02:12.586
Look. there's-- there's
nothing more that I want

1348
01:02:12.689 --> 01:02:14.448
for Toni than for her to be OK.

1349
01:02:14.551 --> 01:02:15.931
But right now she's--

1350
01:02:16.034 --> 01:02:17.206
she's just too unstable.

1351
01:02:19.517 --> 01:02:22.068
This is about selling
the company. isn't it?

1352
01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:30.931
Look. right now the offer
on the table is a good one.

1353
01:02:31.034 --> 01:02:33.724
Oh. OK. and I know you
worry about London.

1354
01:02:33.827 --> 01:02:35.344
I know.

1355
01:02:35.448 --> 01:02:39.103
But this way-- this way you two
will be taken care of for life.

1356
01:02:39.206 --> 01:02:41.724
Victor. you and I both know
Marc didn't want to sell.

1357
01:02:41.827 --> 01:02:43.034
Yeah. but he also
thought he would be

1358
01:02:43.137 --> 01:02:46.310
here to help run the company.

1359
01:02:46.413 --> 01:02:50.206
Look. all-- all I'm saying is
if-- is if Toni gets deemed too

1360
01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:54.413
unfit. OK. I want us to be
able to work together to make

1361
01:02:54.517 --> 01:02:57.448
the best decision for everyone.

1362
01:02:57.551 --> 01:03:01.275
Just-- just think about it.

1363
01:03:01.379 --> 01:03:04.000
If the time comes.
we'll talk about it then.

1364
01:03:06.448 --> 01:03:07.344
OK.

1365
01:03:07.448 --> 01:03:08.379
OK. good enough.

1366
01:03:08.482 --> 01:03:09.310
Good enough.

1367
01:03:17.689 --> 01:03:20.344
Denver. so good to see you.

1368
01:03:20.448 --> 01:03:21.758
You too.

1369
01:03:21.862 --> 01:03:23.758
I was worried about you.

1370
01:03:23.862 --> 01:03:25.724
How are you doing. love?

1371
01:03:25.827 --> 01:03:26.862
Better.

1372
01:03:29.551 --> 01:03:31.000
I'm scared. though.

1373
01:03:34.827 --> 01:03:38.724
The doctor extended
my stay. so I can

1374
01:03:38.827 --> 01:03:40.517
deal with the outside world.

1375
01:03:43.448 --> 01:03:44.689
I can--

1376
01:03:44.793 --> 01:03:47.827
I can only imagine.
with everything

1377
01:03:47.931 --> 01:03:50.827
that you've been through.

1378
01:03:50.931 --> 01:03:54.068
Listen. I-- I'm sorry
to bring this up.

1379
01:03:54.172 --> 01:03:57.655
but we need to talk about
Marc's family and Victor.

1380
01:03:57.758 --> 01:04:00.586
What happened?

1381
01:04:00.689 --> 01:04:03.379
Let's just say that I
need you to get out of here.

1382
01:04:03.482 --> 01:04:05.206
because both Victor
and London have

1383
01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:07.137
reached out to me
about getting you

1384
01:04:07.241 --> 01:04:09.206
deemed unfit to make decisions.

1385
01:04:14.827 --> 01:04:16.827
I expected it from London.

1386
01:04:16.931 --> 01:04:19.620
Victor?

1387
01:04:19.724 --> 01:04:22.000
That's a blow.

1388
01:04:22.103 --> 01:04:23.517
Toni. I think they're
gonna do anything

1389
01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.448
they can to keep you here.

1390
01:04:25.551 --> 01:04:28.172
I know.

1391
01:04:28.275 --> 01:04:30.206
Listen. get me out of here.

1392
01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:31.172
Please.

1393
01:04:33.517 --> 01:04:42.551
Denver. you cannot let them
take Marc's part of the company.

1394
01:04:42.655 --> 01:04:45.275
Please.

1395
01:04:45.379 --> 01:04:47.103
Don't worry.

1396
01:04:47.206 --> 01:04:49.137
I won't let them take
what's rightfully yours.

1397
01:05:06.275 --> 01:05:08.137
You need anything. I'll
be right outside the door.

1398
01:05:08.241 --> 01:05:10.586
Thank you. Doctor.

1399
01:05:10.689 --> 01:05:11.931
Mrs. Carter.

1400
01:05:12.034 --> 01:05:13.758
Detective.

1401
01:05:13.862 --> 01:05:16.517
I hope you're feeling better.

1402
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.448
I am.

1403
01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:24.206
I understand you wanted to talk
to me about my husband's case.

1404
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:26.655
Yes.

1405
01:05:26.758 --> 01:05:31.034
How were things between
you and your husband?

1406
01:05:31.137 --> 01:05:34.896
Things were good.

1407
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.551
I know your husband
had some indiscretions.

1408
01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:42.965
You're talking
about the other women.

1409
01:05:45.827 --> 01:05:47.482
Every marriage has its problems.

1410
01:05:47.586 --> 01:05:49.724
Well I'm sure
that made you angry.

1411
01:05:49.827 --> 01:05:52.137
It did.

1412
01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:55.586
But it didn't make
me want to kill him.

1413
01:05:55.689 --> 01:05:56.586
I loved him.
- Did you?

1414
01:05:56.689 --> 01:05:58.034
I did.

1415
01:05:58.137 --> 01:05:59.586
Is it true that you and
Marc were getting a divorce?

1416
01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:02.965
I know what you're thinking.
but I didn't kill him.

1417
01:06:03.068 --> 01:06:04.517
Well. then who
did. Mrs. Carter?

1418
01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.413
Did you talk to Victor?

1419
01:06:06.517 --> 01:06:08.206
I know he wanted to
sell the company.

1420
01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:10.448
and Marc was
completely against it.

1421
01:06:10.551 --> 01:06:13.000
His alibi checks
out. Mrs. Carter.

1422
01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:14.655
Right now. you're out
number one suspect.

1423
01:06:14.758 --> 01:06:17.862
I loved him.

1424
01:06:17.965 --> 01:06:20.482
We were planning
to start a family.

1425
01:06:20.586 --> 01:06:22.068
A family?

1426
01:06:22.172 --> 01:06:24.965
According to your
husband's medical records.

1427
01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:27.551
he had a vasectomy.

1428
01:06:27.655 --> 01:06:28.413
No.

1429
01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:29.241
Yes.

1430
01:06:29.344 --> 01:06:29.965
No.

1431
01:06:30.068 --> 01:06:30.896
No. you're lying.

1432
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.034
- Mrs--
- You're lying.

1433
01:06:32.137 --> 01:06:32.896
Mrs. Carter!

1434
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:33.758
No. no. no!

1435
01:06:33.862 --> 01:06:34.827
Calm down.

1436
01:06:34.931 --> 01:06:35.689
Dr. Franklin!
- You're lying.

1437
01:06:35.793 --> 01:06:36.517
You're lying!

1438
01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:37.482
Dr. Franklin!

1439
01:06:37.586 --> 01:06:38.310
You're lying!

1440
01:06:38.413 --> 01:06:39.000
He didn't!

1441
01:06:39.103 --> 01:06:40.000
No. no. no!

1442
01:06:40.103 --> 01:06:41.586
Restrain her. restrain her!

1443
01:06:41.689 --> 01:06:43.896
No. no. there's no way!

1444
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:44.862
I didn't do it.

1445
01:06:44.965 --> 01:06:47.068
I didn't kill my husband!

1446
01:06:47.172 --> 01:06:49.862
Wait. wait!

1447
01:06:49.965 --> 01:06:50.793
Please. no!

1448
01:06:53.758 --> 01:06:55.758
No. no. no. no!

1449
01:06:55.862 --> 01:06:56.586
No way.

1450
01:06:56.689 --> 01:06:58.000
No. I didn't do it.

1451
01:06:58.103 --> 01:06:59.241
I didn't do it!

1452
01:07:15.689 --> 01:07:18.068
Nicole. I thought this
was a business meeting.

1453
01:07:18.172 --> 01:07:19.551
Oh. it is a business meeting.

1454
01:07:23.241 --> 01:07:24.862
Cocktail?

1455
01:07:24.965 --> 01:07:26.793
Sure.

1456
01:07:26.896 --> 01:07:28.551
So why are you here?

1457
01:07:28.655 --> 01:07:30.206
Toni.

1458
01:07:30.310 --> 01:07:31.310
What about her?

1459
01:07:31.413 --> 01:07:32.517
Oh. you haven't heard?

1460
01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.379
Heard what?

1461
01:07:34.482 --> 01:07:36.724
She had a meltdown
when Detective McKenzie

1462
01:07:36.827 --> 01:07:37.965
went to go question her.

1463
01:07:38.068 --> 01:07:39.931
She had to be restrained.

1464
01:07:40.034 --> 01:07:40.931
Wow.

1465
01:07:41.034 --> 01:07:42.620
What are you doing?

1466
01:07:42.724 --> 01:07:44.000
I'm calling Dr. Franklin.

1467
01:07:44.103 --> 01:07:45.344
I need to check on Toni.

1468
01:07:45.448 --> 01:07:47.103
She's in a place with
doctors all around her.

1469
01:07:47.206 --> 01:07:48.793
She'll be fine.

1470
01:07:48.896 --> 01:07:50.344
Uh. what are you doing?

1471
01:07:50.448 --> 01:07:53.586
Trying to have a conversation.

1472
01:07:53.689 --> 01:07:55.655
I'm listening.

1473
01:07:55.758 --> 01:08:00.862
We both know that Toni
is not fit right now.

1474
01:08:00.965 --> 01:08:02.862
Nicole. she has
not been declared

1475
01:08:02.965 --> 01:08:04.827
unfit to make decisions.

1476
01:08:04.931 --> 01:08:06.172
I know.

1477
01:08:06.275 --> 01:08:10.724
As you know. Holden has
a big deal on the table.

1478
01:08:10.827 --> 01:08:12.586
I can't sign for Toni.

1479
01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:13.448
You know that.

1480
01:08:13.551 --> 01:08:16.965
Denver. Toni trusts you.

1481
01:08:17.068 --> 01:08:21.724
You can convince her to sign
before we lose this deal.

1482
01:08:21.827 --> 01:08:23.137
We?

1483
01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:25.034
Look. there's a lot for
everybody to benefit here.

1484
01:08:25.137 --> 01:08:28.103
It's $200 million.

1485
01:08:28.206 --> 01:08:29.310
You don't really
think I wouldn't let

1486
01:08:29.413 --> 01:08:32.758
you get a piece of that pie?

1487
01:08:32.862 --> 01:08:37.620
That is. unless you like pie.

1488
01:08:41.896 --> 01:08:45.137
Baby. I know this is rough.

1489
01:08:45.241 --> 01:08:47.310
But you're gonna get through it.

1490
01:08:47.413 --> 01:08:50.344
It's so hard. Grandma.

1491
01:08:50.448 --> 01:08:52.172
I'm trying to keep it together.

1492
01:08:52.275 --> 01:08:54.206
And you will.

1493
01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:56.344
You will.

1494
01:08:56.448 --> 01:08:59.448
Your mother suffered
with the same issues.

1495
01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:05.862
Depression and anxiety had
her all over the place.

1496
01:09:05.965 --> 01:09:07.551
Mama killed herself.

1497
01:09:07.655 --> 01:09:10.517
Honey. she
refused to get help.

1498
01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.724
You didn't.

1499
01:09:12.827 --> 01:09:16.344
Now. I have talked to
Dr. Franklin every day.

1500
01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:20.241
and he says you're
doing really well.

1501
01:09:20.344 --> 01:09:23.517
Baby. you've been through a lot.

1502
01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:27.310
And you know I'm gonna
get you the best help.

1503
01:09:29.793 --> 01:09:31.586
I love you. Grandma.

1504
01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:32.241
Sweetie.

1505
01:09:32.344 --> 01:09:33.379
Thank you.

1506
01:09:36.896 --> 01:09:40.517
I brought you a friendly
face with me today.

1507
01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:46.275
You two catch up while
I go talk to the doctor.

1508
01:09:46.379 --> 01:09:52.241
Baby. I love you.

1509
01:09:52.344 --> 01:09:56.068
They're all just pawns. honey.

1510
01:09:56.172 --> 01:09:57.000
Hey.

1511
01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:11.068
Hey. August.

1512
01:10:11.172 --> 01:10:12.517
So good to see you.

1513
01:10:15.206 --> 01:10:17.965
I have more. but um. they
wouldn't let me bring him in.

1514
01:10:18.068 --> 01:10:19.896
So I snuck this one in for you.

1515
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.241
So sweet.

1516
01:10:21.344 --> 01:10:23.931
Well. I'd like to see
a smile on your face.

1517
01:10:24.034 --> 01:10:28.965
So I got the books
that you wanted.

1518
01:10:29.068 --> 01:10:29.896
Thank you.

1519
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.482
So I mean. how have
you-- how have you been?

1520
01:10:35.586 --> 01:10:38.931
I mean. you-- you look better.

1521
01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:41.827
Honestly I'm scared.

1522
01:10:41.931 --> 01:10:44.000
They think I did it.

1523
01:10:44.103 --> 01:10:45.275
Hey. hey. hey.

1524
01:10:45.379 --> 01:10:47.068
Don't-- don't-- don't
worry about that.

1525
01:10:47.172 --> 01:10:51.793
That-- that'll never stick.
I know you didn't do this.

1526
01:10:51.896 --> 01:10:55.068
Toni. I-- I know you.

1527
01:10:55.172 --> 01:10:58.965
Anything you need me
to do. I'll do it.

1528
01:12:00.413 --> 01:12:03.862
Thank you. Mrs. Carter.
for meeting with me again.

1529
01:12:03.965 --> 01:12:06.620
I want to do whatever I can
to help solve my husband's case.

1530
01:12:06.724 --> 01:12:08.034
OK.

1531
01:12:08.137 --> 01:12:09.827
Tell me about the fight you
had the night of the party.

1532
01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.689
It was stupid. really.

1533
01:12:15.793 --> 01:12:21.551
Um. honestly. I just let
my jealousy take hold.

1534
01:12:21.655 --> 01:12:24.137
I-- he invited
somebody to the party

1535
01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:26.275
I thought he was sleeping with.

1536
01:12:26.379 --> 01:12:31.724
I mixed my alcohol with
meds. and I fell asleep.

1537
01:12:31.827 --> 01:12:33.206
All night.

1538
01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:35.655
I see.

1539
01:12:35.758 --> 01:12:39.620
This is your husband's
boat. correct?

1540
01:12:39.724 --> 01:12:40.758
Yes.

1541
01:12:40.862 --> 01:12:41.862
It is that blood?

1542
01:12:41.965 --> 01:12:43.482
Mrs. Carter. your
husband was bludgeoned

1543
01:12:43.586 --> 01:12:45.827
to death with a blunt
object and thrown overboard.

1544
01:12:45.931 --> 01:12:46.655
Oh my God.

1545
01:12:46.758 --> 01:12:47.965
Why would somebody do that?

1546
01:12:48.068 --> 01:12:51.413
Toni. this was an
impulsive act. unplanned.

1547
01:12:51.517 --> 01:12:55.482
the kind of thing a
person does out of anger.

1548
01:12:55.586 --> 01:12:58.206
Do you know who this is?

1549
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:59.344
No.

1550
01:12:59.448 --> 01:13:00.206
Looks a lot like you.

1551
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:01.103
That's not me.

1552
01:13:01.206 --> 01:13:01.931
You're sure?

1553
01:13:02.034 --> 01:13:03.965
Yes. it's not me.

1554
01:13:04.068 --> 01:13:05.000
Recognize this?

1555
01:13:08.413 --> 01:13:09.482
Yes.

1556
01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:11.034
Marc gave me that bracelet.

1557
01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.482
I was wearing it the
night of the party.

1558
01:13:13.586 --> 01:13:14.724
Where did you get it?

1559
01:13:14.827 --> 01:13:16.482
Mrs. Carter. it was
found on the boat.

1560
01:13:16.586 --> 01:13:18.586
Detective. someone
is trying to set me up.

1561
01:13:18.689 --> 01:13:19.551
Who. Mrs. Carter?
Who?

1562
01:13:19.655 --> 01:13:20.482
Victor. I told you that.

1563
01:13:20.586 --> 01:13:22.482
His alibi checks out!

1564
01:13:22.586 --> 01:13:25.034
Take a seat.

1565
01:13:25.137 --> 01:13:26.275
Let me prove it.

1566
01:13:26.379 --> 01:13:27.793
Please.

1567
01:13:27.896 --> 01:13:31.758
Just exactly how are you
going to help me prove it?

1568
01:13:31.862 --> 01:13:33.034
Nicole.

1569
01:13:33.137 --> 01:13:35.344
Nicole is covering for Victor.

1570
01:13:35.448 --> 01:13:38.689
If you just let me call
Nicole. I can prove it!

1571
01:13:38.793 --> 01:13:40.000
I'm not sure that's advisable.

1572
01:13:40.103 --> 01:13:41.551
Please. I have to do this!

1573
01:13:41.655 --> 01:13:44.379
If Victor is the murderer.
that means Nicole is in danger.

1574
01:13:44.482 --> 01:13:46.620
Detective McKenzie.
I have to call her.

1575
01:13:46.724 --> 01:13:47.517
Please.

1576
01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.931
I can prove it!

1577
01:14:04.379 --> 01:14:07.172
Nicole. I'm freaking out.

1578
01:14:07.275 --> 01:14:08.965
No. you have to come up here.

1579
01:14:09.068 --> 01:14:11.413
No. it has to be now.

1580
01:14:11.517 --> 01:14:12.551
It's about Victor.

1581
01:14:17.275 --> 01:14:19.137
Oh. my goodness.

1582
01:14:19.241 --> 01:14:20.000
Toni.

1583
01:14:20.103 --> 01:14:21.241
Oh. you look awful.

1584
01:14:21.344 --> 01:14:24.275
You OK?

1585
01:14:24.379 --> 01:14:25.551
Thanks.

1586
01:14:25.655 --> 01:14:27.517
Exactly what I need
to hear right now.

1587
01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:28.413
I'm sorry.

1588
01:14:28.517 --> 01:14:30.241
I didn't mean that.

1589
01:14:30.344 --> 01:14:31.413
What's going on?

1590
01:14:31.517 --> 01:14:34.172
You sounded frantic
on the phone.

1591
01:14:34.275 --> 01:14:37.275
Nicole. I'm so scared.

1592
01:14:37.379 --> 01:14:38.931
They think I killed Marc.

1593
01:14:39.034 --> 01:14:40.793
But-- no. you
could never do that.

1594
01:14:40.896 --> 01:14:41.517
I know.

1595
01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:42.758
That's what I told them.

1596
01:14:42.862 --> 01:14:46.448
But they're not Listening.

1597
01:14:46.551 --> 01:14:48.448
Nicole. I got to
tell you something.

1598
01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:51.103
Baby. what is it?

1599
01:14:51.206 --> 01:14:52.793
I know you love Victor.

1600
01:14:52.896 --> 01:14:54.689
And I know he was best
friends with Marc.

1601
01:14:54.793 --> 01:14:59.379
But I think he did it.

1602
01:14:59.482 --> 01:15:02.068
What do you mean?

1603
01:15:02.172 --> 01:15:03.896
I think he killed Marc.

1604
01:15:05.172 --> 01:15:06.586
Well. maybe-- maybe he
hired someone to do it.

1605
01:15:06.689 --> 01:15:07.413
I don't know.

1606
01:15:07.517 --> 01:15:08.896
I'm not sure.

1607
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.482
Toni. that is the craziest
thing you've ever said.

1608
01:15:10.586 --> 01:15:12.206
I know it sounds crazy.

1609
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:13.896
But think about it.

1610
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.758
Victor was the only
one that had something

1611
01:15:15.862 --> 01:15:18.482
to gain from Marc's death.

1612
01:15:18.586 --> 01:15:21.034
And he had the means to do it.

1613
01:15:21.137 --> 01:15:23.448
I think he killed Marc.

1614
01:15:23.551 --> 01:15:24.758
And now he's trying to frame me.

1615
01:15:24.862 --> 01:15:27.448
Toni. Victor was
with me that night.

1616
01:15:27.551 --> 01:15:29.034
I know he didn't do it.

1617
01:15:29.137 --> 01:15:30.724
We went straight
home after the party.

1618
01:15:30.827 --> 01:15:32.413
and I know he didn't leave.

1619
01:15:32.517 --> 01:15:34.620
I know you're trying
to protect Victor.

1620
01:15:34.724 --> 01:15:36.000
but you don't have
to protect him.

1621
01:15:36.103 --> 01:15:37.758
I got to tell you.
Doc. this isn't looking

1622
01:15:37.862 --> 01:15:39.241
too good for your patient.

1623
01:15:39.344 --> 01:15:40.586
Just give it a second.

1624
01:15:40.689 --> 01:15:42.000
See how this plays out.

1625
01:15:42.103 --> 01:15:44.344
--this is awful for you.
and that you are still

1626
01:15:44.448 --> 01:15:46.655
in deep grief over Marc. but--

1627
01:15:46.758 --> 01:15:49.517
but it's taking you to extremes.

1628
01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:50.827
Girl. listen to yourself.

1629
01:15:54.586 --> 01:15:55.620
Oh. fuck.

1630
01:15:58.068 --> 01:15:58.586
Oh my God.

1631
01:15:58.689 --> 01:16:01.413
You're right.

1632
01:16:01.517 --> 01:16:04.344
I just miss him.

1633
01:16:04.448 --> 01:16:05.620
And I just keep
thinking about how

1634
01:16:05.724 --> 01:16:08.344
awful I was to him sometimes.

1635
01:16:08.448 --> 01:16:10.827
And how I didn't appreciate
that he was trying.

1636
01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:12.068
He knows that you loved him.

1637
01:16:12.172 --> 01:16:13.034
OK?

1638
01:16:13.137 --> 01:16:14.724
Even-- even with
all of his faults.

1639
01:16:19.655 --> 01:16:21.482
Do you still
have that bracelet

1640
01:16:21.586 --> 01:16:24.413
that I gave you at the party?

1641
01:16:24.517 --> 01:16:25.965
Oh. now. this is interesting.

1642
01:16:26.068 --> 01:16:27.862
It's the only thing I have
left that Marc tried to give

1643
01:16:27.965 --> 01:16:30.275
to me that I didn't appreciate.

1644
01:16:30.379 --> 01:16:31.551
Of course I still have it.

1645
01:16:31.655 --> 01:16:32.620
You gave it to me.
- Oh my God.

1646
01:16:32.724 --> 01:16:33.620
Thank God.

1647
01:16:33.724 --> 01:16:34.724
Can I have it back. please?

1648
01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:38.551
Why?

1649
01:16:38.655 --> 01:16:41.379
You practically threw it at me.

1650
01:16:41.482 --> 01:16:43.103
Yeah. I was being spiteful.

1651
01:16:43.206 --> 01:16:45.344
I was angry.

1652
01:16:45.448 --> 01:16:47.689
That's the one thing I have
left that Marc gave to me.

1653
01:16:47.793 --> 01:16:49.517
Because everything
else he gave you wasn't

1654
01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:50.862
good enough for you. huh?

1655
01:16:53.482 --> 01:16:54.551
Why are you so angry?

1656
01:16:54.655 --> 01:16:59.896
It is always
about you. isn't it?

1657
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.517
Nicole. I'm just trying to--

1658
01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:04.724
You had the perfect life.
but that wasn't enough for you.

1659
01:17:04.827 --> 01:17:09.034
You had a gorgeous
husband who adored you.

1660
01:17:09.137 --> 01:17:11.827
But you couldn't
support his dreams.

1661
01:17:11.931 --> 01:17:13.862
No. you wanted him to
cater to your every whim.

1662
01:17:13.965 --> 01:17:18.000
Hell. you want everybody in here
to cater to your every whim.

1663
01:17:18.103 --> 01:17:22.034
I begged Marc to leave
you. but he wouldn't.

1664
01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:22.758
What?

1665
01:17:22.862 --> 01:17:24.137
You heard me.

1666
01:17:24.241 --> 01:17:27.275
All you did was whine
about everything.

1667
01:17:27.379 --> 01:17:29.448
So this is the one thing
you will not get back.

1668
01:17:29.551 --> 01:17:30.551
because that
bracelet should have

1669
01:17:30.655 --> 01:17:32.068
been mine in the first place.

1670
01:17:38.379 --> 01:17:47.724
Um. you mean you and Marc?

1671
01:17:47.827 --> 01:17:48.862
Me and Marc.

1672
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:56.413
Marc and I had been seeing
each other for over a year.

1673
01:18:01.172 --> 01:18:03.517
He couldn't deal
with your crazy ass.

1674
01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:05.103
I consoled him.

1675
01:18:05.206 --> 01:18:08.827
I was his relief from the
wife he didn't want kids with.

1676
01:18:08.931 --> 01:18:11.482
If it wasn't for his
crazy devotion for you.

1677
01:18:11.586 --> 01:18:14.000
he'd still be alive.

1678
01:18:14.103 --> 01:18:16.241
That's a confession.

1679
01:18:16.344 --> 01:18:18.586
Ugh.

1680
01:18:18.689 --> 01:18:19.517
I'm gonna be sick.

1681
01:18:23.448 --> 01:18:26.034
Toni. before I walk out of
here and never talk to you

1682
01:18:26.137 --> 01:18:27.931
again. I want you
to know the truth.

1683
01:18:33.482 --> 01:18:36.310
It wasn't Victor.

1684
01:18:36.413 --> 01:18:37.344
It was you.

1685
01:18:41.068 --> 01:18:43.793
We spent so many nights
out there on that boat.

1686
01:18:46.068 --> 01:18:48.655
When he drove away. I knew
he was going to our spot

1687
01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:50.379
at Chesapeake Marina.

1688
01:18:50.482 --> 01:18:53.827
So I drove over here
and I got on board.

1689
01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:55.620
God. Nicole. how could you?

1690
01:18:55.724 --> 01:18:57.655
I didn't mean to.

1691
01:18:57.758 --> 01:18:58.965
I tried to reason with him.

1692
01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:00.137
I told him he could
just sell the company

1693
01:19:00.241 --> 01:19:02.517
and we could run off together.

1694
01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:04.000
But he didn't listen.

1695
01:19:04.103 --> 01:19:06.758
And then he had the nerve
to bring his other side

1696
01:19:06.862 --> 01:19:07.896
piece to the party.

1697
01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:13.482
Nicole.

1698
01:19:13.586 --> 01:19:14.413
I just--

1699
01:19:16.931 --> 01:19:18.000
I-- I snapped.

1700
01:19:25.793 --> 01:19:27.758
And I grabbed that
fire extinguisher.

1701
01:19:27.862 --> 01:19:30.034
and I hit him in
his entitled face.

1702
01:19:30.137 --> 01:19:32.241
And when he went
down. I hit him again.

1703
01:19:38.034 --> 01:19:41.724
But I didn't mean to kill him.

1704
01:19:41.827 --> 01:19:42.862
I loved him. too.

1705
01:19:45.862 --> 01:19:50.000
I gave so much to him. but every
time I did. he just chose you.

1706
01:19:52.482 --> 01:19:53.310
Shit!

1707
01:20:00.068 --> 01:20:03.034
Nobody's gonna believe
you. you crazy bitch!

1708
01:20:03.137 --> 01:20:04.965
Thank you for killing
my husband for me.

1709
01:20:05.068 --> 01:20:08.172
You did me a favor. bestie!

1710
01:20:08.275 --> 01:20:08.896
Toni.

1711
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.586
Toni. enough. enough!

1712
01:20:10.689 --> 01:20:11.551
No!

1713
01:20:11.655 --> 01:20:14.310
Go to jail. bitch!

1714
01:20:14.413 --> 01:20:17.620
No. no!

1715
01:20:17.724 --> 01:20:20.793
Go to jail. bitch!

1716
01:20:20.896 --> 01:20:21.620
Rest.

1717
01:20:21.724 --> 01:20:22.793
Rest. Toni.

1718
01:20:22.896 --> 01:20:25.344
Just calm down.

1719
01:20:25.448 --> 01:20:27.586
How'd you know?

1720
01:20:27.689 --> 01:20:28.517
The bracelet.

1721
01:21:01.551 --> 01:21:03.275
Sent.

1722
01:21:03.379 --> 01:21:04.758
I don't have to
fake it. so I guess

1723
01:21:04.862 --> 01:21:06.965
I won't need these anymore.

1724
01:21:15.241 --> 01:21:16.931
Ah.

1725
01:21:17.034 --> 01:21:18.896
Let's go. my queen.

1726
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Let's go.

1727
01:21:37.551 --> 01:21:38.862
And you need to
check those accounts.

1728
01:21:38.965 --> 01:21:40.034
My brother was a millionaire.

1729
01:21:40.137 --> 01:21:41.379
I know there's
something in there.

1730
01:21:41.482 --> 01:21:42.448
Sorry. ma'am.

1731
01:21:42.551 --> 01:21:43.827
I've checked the
account several times.

1732
01:21:43.931 --> 01:21:45.344
The account is at 0.

1733
01:21:45.448 --> 01:21:46.379
It's been closed.

1734
01:21:46.482 --> 01:21:48.724
Have a good day.

1735
01:21:48.827 --> 01:21:49.655
What did she do?

1736
01:21:56.482 --> 01:21:59.862
Now that we got
that out of the way.

1737
01:21:59.965 --> 01:22:01.034
Exactly.

1738
01:22:01.137 --> 01:22:02.172
Now give me some.

1739
01:22:14.068 --> 01:22:15.137
- Toni.
- Take it off.

1740
01:22:15.241 --> 01:22:16.034
No.

1741
01:22:54.586 --> 01:22:57.586
Anything you need
me to do. I'll do it.

1742
01:23:49.586 --> 01:23:50.689
Is that Marc?

1743
01:23:50.793 --> 01:23:53.000
No. it's just a reminder.

1744
01:23:58.586 --> 01:24:00.551
Mrs. Carter has a
proposition for you.

1745
01:24:14.862 --> 01:24:16.758
I want it bad.

1746
01:24:16.862 --> 01:24:18.172
I want a piece of you.

1747
01:24:18.275 --> 01:24:21.137
Diamonds and things.
without any strings.

1748
01:24:21.241 --> 01:24:25.689
If it ain't about money.
then what's it about?

1749
01:24:25.793 --> 01:24:27.103
Stick to the plan.

1750
01:24:27.206 --> 01:24:28.103
There's too much to count.

1751
01:24:28.206 --> 01:24:29.103
I need a trophy.

1752
01:24:29.206 --> 01:24:31.068
I need a trophy wife.

1753
01:24:31.172 --> 01:24:32.103
I need a trophy.

1754
01:24:32.206 --> 01:24:33.689
I need a trophy.

1755
01:24:33.793 --> 01:24:34.655
I need a trophy wife.

1756
01:24:34.758 --> 01:24:36.034
I need a trophy.

1757
01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:38.965
It ain't about money.
then what's it about?

1758
01:24:39.068 --> 01:24:40.793
Stick to the plan.

1759
01:24:40.896 --> 01:24:42.793
There's too much to count.

1760
01:24:42.896 --> 01:24:44.689
I want it bad.

1761
01:24:44.793 --> 01:24:46.034
I want a piece of you.

1762
01:24:46.137 --> 01:24:49.586
Diamonds and things.
without any strings.

1763
01:24:49.689 --> 01:24:52.827
If it ain't about money.
then what's it about?

1764
01:24:52.931 --> 01:24:55.000
This is the thing.

1765
01:24:55.103 --> 01:24:56.482
There's too much to count.

1766
01:24:56.586 --> 01:24:57.793
I need a trophy.

1767
01:24:57.896 --> 01:24:58.620
I need a trophy wife.

1768
01:24:58.724 --> 01:24:59.896
I need a trophy.

1769
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.068
I need a trophy.

1770
01:25:01.172 --> 01:25:01.965
I need a trophy wife.

1771
01:25:02.068 --> 01:25:03.310
I need a trophy.

1772
01:25:03.413 --> 01:25:06.689
If it ain't about money.
then what's it about?

1773
01:25:06.793 --> 01:25:08.827
Stick to the plan.

1774
01:25:08.931 --> 01:25:09.931
It's too much to count.

1775
01:25:10.034 --> 01:25:11.068
I don't even know who to trust.

1776
01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:12.931
Money can make your
adrenaline rush.

1777
01:25:13.034 --> 01:25:14.517
Even your family
be doing too much.

1778
01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:16.344
You want to love. OK for lust.

1779
01:25:16.448 --> 01:25:18.275
I ride alone when I'm
traveling to places.

1780
01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:19.724
Want me a ship. but
I had to be patient.

1781
01:25:19.827 --> 01:25:21.482
Then they forget all the
bread you was breaking.

1782
01:25:21.586 --> 01:25:23.275
I said. whatever I came
with it. I'm taking it.

1783
01:25:23.379 --> 01:25:24.965
They want what I have.
and want what I got.

1784
01:25:25.068 --> 01:25:25.931
I try to be clutch.

1785
01:25:26.034 --> 01:25:27.275
I'm rich and I'm cut.

1786
01:25:27.379 --> 01:25:28.586
This shit's like a
movie. thick is the plot.

1787
01:25:28.689 --> 01:25:29.275
You say you love me.

1788
01:25:29.379 --> 01:25:30.379
I hear that a lot.
