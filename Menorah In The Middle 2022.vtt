Okay. let's talk
about the future.

22
00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:22.749
Great. let's tomorrow start
with the Champs Elysee.

23
00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.376
then hit up the Louvre.

24
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:27.546
lunch at La Cafe Marly.

25
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:32.676
a walk down the Seine.
perhaps a pre-dinner crepe?

26
00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:34.094
Croissant?

27
00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.513
Oh. no. my trainer
has me on a paleo diet.

28
00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:37.973
You know that's
for cavemen. right?

29
00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:39.016
Have you seen cavemen?

30
00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:40.934
They're very fit.

31
00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.229
They also bonk women on the
head and drag them into caves.

32
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.191
Unlike you. who goes to Paris
for a nine-month anniversary.

33
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.736
Oh. come on.
wasn't a big deal.

34
00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:53.697
Please. I have cream cheese
in my fridge older
than our relationship

35
00:01:53.697 --> 00:01:56.450
and it never took me to Paris.
(chuckles)

36
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.285
Well. I had to go
to Switzerland anyway.

37
00:01:58.285 --> 00:01:59.870
Chad. stop trying to spoil it.

38
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.748
It's romantic. you took
me to Paris. the end.

39
00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:04.750
Oh. maybe the beginning.

40
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.086
You know. this Swiss deal
is huge for me.

41
00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:11.506
like next-tax-bracket huge.

42
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:16.178
And I was thinking
maybe we could enter
that tax bracket together.

43
00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:21.266
It makes so much sense
for us to get married.

44
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.060
What do you say?

45
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.312
This is all moving so fast.
you haven't even met my family.

46
00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.564
Well. but I'm flying
home for Chanukah.

47
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:29.775
I'm gonna see them
in a few days.

48
00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:30.901
Hanukkah.

49
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.152
That's what I said.

50
00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.823
I'm proposing to you.
not your family.

51
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:41.036
You've never dated a
Jewish girl before. huh?

52
00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:46.041
But they're gonna love me.
just like you do. huh?

53
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:47.250
What do you say?

54
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.628
Do we close the deal?

55
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.215
Yes.

56
00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:54.341
(uplifting music)

57
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:57.844
I do close the deal. I do!

58
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.267
(upbeat jazz music)

59
00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.813
(plane engine roaring)

60
00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:09.356
Let's go over the
basics one more time.

61
00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.566
how many nights
of Hanukkah are there?

62
00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.945
Nice try. that's a tricky one.
changes every year.

63
00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:18.031
What. no. the dates
change every year
based on the Jewish calendar.

64
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.200
No. you said December 8th.

65
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.494
I said there were
eight nights of Hanukkah.

66
00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:24.579
Let's move on. my family runs a?

67
00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.207
A bakery.
but not just any bakery.

68
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:30.961
"Becker Family Bread:
A pillar of the community
for three generations."

69
00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:35.424
My dad's name is?

70
00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:37.134
-Frank.
-Mom?

71
00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.635
-Linda.
-Brother?

72
00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:40.470
-Oh...
-Think fast.

73
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.805
'cause he's picking this up
in like two minutes.

74
00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.682
Oh. I got this one.

75
00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:46.768
Sagar.

76
00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.813
-Sagar?
-Yeah. he's picking us up.
Uber Black.

77
00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:51.648
What?

78
00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:53.692
Yeah. I figured we could
use a nice ride to the hotel.

79
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.529
Hotel. what hotel?
We're staying with my parents.

80
00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.031
Think of the hotel
like a life raft.

81
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:03.034
we don't have to stay there.
but we have it if we need it.

82
00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.287
-A life raft on the Titanic.
-(Chad) Eh?

83
00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:06.955
You've never met my parents.

84
00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:09.416
Staying at a hotel
would be beyond scandalous.

85
00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.251
I'd have to wear
a scarlet H on my shirt

86
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.794
-for the rest of my life.
-Hey. calm down. baby.

87
00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.504
I just need a place to work.

88
00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.007
This Swiss deal has
to be closed by New Year's.

89
00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:20.594
I'm gonna be with your family
for dinner and Chanukah stuff.

90
00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:23.597
but sometimes I need to work
and I need stable Wi-Fi.

91
00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:25.307
My parents have Wi-Fi.

92
00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:28.810
Like stable. like
video-conference stable. huh?

93
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.062
Sagar?

94
00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.024
Hey.

95
00:04:34.024 --> 00:04:38.111
Yeah. babe. that's Sagar.
I'm gonna go to the hotel.
get some work done.

96
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.238
You have fun
with your big brother.

97
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.949
put some FaceTime in
and we'll reconnect
with your parents later tonight.

98
00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.701
-You promise?
-Yeah. cross my heart.

99
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.829
Oh. don't tell them
about the engagement. please.

100
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.664
I wanna do that together. deal?

101
00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:51.541
Deal. you wanna shake on it?

102
00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.336
You might want to
take that ring off.

103
00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:55.837
Yeah. off.

104
00:04:56.463 --> 00:05:00.050
(light upbeat music)

105
00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.095
(Sarah and Jacob laughing)

106
00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.639
So Esther Schwartz.
do you remember her?

107
00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.057
-Yeah.
-Right.

108
00:05:07.057 --> 00:05:08.558
She tells me the bagels
tastes different.

109
00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:10.268
I said.
"They do not taste different."

110
00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.103
She said. "Jacob.
the bagels tastes different."

111
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.481
I said. "Esther.
we haven't changed
this recipe in 80 years.

112
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.859
But. no. if you think
they taste different.
the bagels taste different."

113
00:05:17.859 --> 00:05:21.571
Oh. my God.
I thought that arguing
with customers was dad's job.

114
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.990
Mostly he just
kinda putzes around.

115
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.034
keep it... and smiling a lot.

116
00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:29.371
Mom's still handling the books.
but I have been
running the bakery.

117
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.291
That's amazing.
you're like taking over
the family business.

118
00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:35.961
I missed you.

119
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.798
I really did. how
long has it been?
It's been like almost two years.

120
00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.550
I know. I missed you too.

121
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.344
It turns out that giving up
your corporate job

122
00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.054
to start an
independent food blog

123
00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.889
doesn't leave much money
for vacations.

124
00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.474
Oh. you know who came home?

125
00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:50.725
-This is fun.
-Who?

126
00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.935
Ben.

127
00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:54.354
-Ben's here?
-Ben's here.

128
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.690
What. I'm just surprised.

129
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.317
It's like. I just thought
he traveled around the world.

130
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:01.069
taking amazing photos.

131
00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:03.405
It's like he's in a
different country every week.

132
00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:04.739
Shut up.

133
00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:10.537
I can't believe
the Baum sisters grew up

134
00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:13.331
in Sol Viejo just a
few grades above us.

135
00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:17.210
Look at them now.
they're like the Julia Child.

136
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.880
they're like the Julia Children
of our generation.

137
00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:24.759
Yeah. and I'm a food blogger
who can't even get
verified on social media.

138
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.344
How'd they do it?

139
00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:28.555
Know what dad always says.

140
00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:30.515
-Oh. he's not still saying it.
-Oh. yeah. he is.

141
00:06:30.515 --> 00:06:32.475
"Rachel and Becky Baum

142
00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:36.062
used to come into our bakery
every day after school

143
00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.356
for two pieces of rugelach.

144
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:41.568
Nothing made them happier
than my rugelach.

145
00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.862
it's probably
why they became chefs."

146
00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:45.530
It's so embarrassing.

147
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.449
It's humiliating.
but imagine if it was true.

148
00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.617
I'm pretty sure that...

149
00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.910
(brakes screech)

150
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.245
Where's your boyfriend?

151
00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.914
(light jazz music)

152
00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.501
Okay. I'm gonna pull around
back. I'll meet you inside.

153
00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:01.338
Oh. wait. wait. wait!

154
00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:03.340
I really wanna see
mom and dad's face

155
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.343
when you tell them
that Chad's staying at a hotel.
So. wait for me.

156
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.013
I need this.

157
00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:14.976
(soft gentle music)

158
00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:17.354
(key clicking)

159
00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:22.317
(soft music)

160
00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:34.120
Sarah!

161
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.457
-Oh. we missed you. kiddo!
-I missed you too.

162
00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.669
-Mum.
-You must be starving.

163
00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.462
I'm fine.

164
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.922
-Are you kidding.
I can practically see through...
-Mom.

165
00:07:43.922 --> 00:07:45.256
What's the last time
you had a (indistinct).

166
00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:46.925
Oh. come on. give her a break.

167
00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.385
Hey. okay. I'm gonna go out
and meet Chad

168
00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:49.803
and I'm gonna help
him with the bags.

169
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:50.762
Oh. Chad's not
here at the moment.

170
00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.263
Oh. honey. what's wrong?

171
00:07:52.263 --> 00:07:54.808
Oh. no. no. nothing.
he's in Sol Viejo.

172
00:07:54.808 --> 00:07:56.726
he's just not like
right here in this room.

173
00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.687
Well. exactly. because
he's getting the luggage.

174
00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:00.563
See. there's nothing
to worry about. honey.

175
00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:03.149
No. Dad. Chad has a lot of work
to do over Hanukkah.

176
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.360
like a lot of video
finance conference calls.

177
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.611
So. he rented
an office for the week.

178
00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.279
Oh. like a work week.

179
00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:11.866
Exactly. except it has
a bed in a concierge.

180
00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.076
Chad's staying at a hotel.

181
00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.285
Thanks. Jake.

182
00:08:14.285 --> 00:08:16.121
I beg you to wait for me.

183
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:18.540
I don't understand. did we
do something to offend him?

184
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.959
-You haven't even met him.
-And that offended him?

185
00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.336
No. he's just
getting some work done

186
00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:26.548
and then he's gonna come here
and eat and then stay.

187
00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:29.467
Oh. good. because your mother
prepared her famous briskets.

188
00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:32.345
Okay. if he can't make it.
I'll just put his
brisket in the freezer.

189
00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.514
-Don't do that.
-I don't want it to get cold.

190
00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:36.266
Let's get you settled sweetie.

191
00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:38.226
Come on. my daughter
is home for Hanukah.

192
00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:41.229
best gift in the world.

193
00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:45.191
(soft music playing)

194
00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:01.541
(Ben) Smile.

195
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:04.252
(camera shutters)

196
00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:06.504
Ben.

197
00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.092
Hi. (chuckles)

198
00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.261
What are you doing down there?

199
00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:15.430
Honestly. trying to decide

200
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.600
if I should tell my Juliet joke
or my Rapunzel joke?

201
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.518
Let's hear them both
and I'll decide.

202
00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:24.022
Okay. they are both terrible.
just know that I know that.

203
00:09:24.022 --> 00:09:25.732
Noted.

204
00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:28.443
Rapunzel. Rapunzel.
let down your hair.

205
00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:31.279
unless you are an Orthodox Jew.
in which case it's a wig

206
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.698
and I will definitely
break my neck
should I try to climb it.

207
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.661
Not a wig. also not
long enough to climb.

208
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:42.290
but if you don't mind
waiting there. say 20 years.

209
00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:44.459
Fine by me.

210
00:09:45.502 --> 00:09:47.212
What's the next one. Romeo?

211
00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:49.005
(speaks foreign language)

212
00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.215
(phone chimes)

213
00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:52.634
-Oh. one sec.
-Where...

214
00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:56.054
-Hello?
-(Chad) I think your phone's
broken. I'll get you new one.

215
00:09:56.054 --> 00:09:57.430
No. my phone's fine.

216
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.265
(Chad) But I texted you
two minutes ago.

217
00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.976
I'm here.
Bakery looks closed though.

218
00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.812
I can make (indistinct)
somewhere else.

219
00:10:03.812 --> 00:10:06.231
No. no. no. stay right there.
I'll be down in one sec.

220
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.525
-I gotta go.
-Oh. hey...

221
00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:10.777
Come over for the first night
of Hanukkah tomorrow.

222
00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:12.278
I want you to meet someone.

223
00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.404
(Ben) Okay.

224
00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:16.074
There he is.

225
00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:19.452
-Hey. Frankie.
-Whoa.

226
00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:20.620
Okay.

227
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.956
We've heard so much about you.

228
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.500
Oh. you didn't tell me
you had a sister.

229
00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.044
Don't tell me you're Linda.

230
00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.047
Mrs. Becker?

231
00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.841
No. no. Mrs. Becker
is your mother.
'cause you're Sarah's sister.

232
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.634
Hi. he's funny.

233
00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.887
Yeah. Linda. Linda.

234
00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.556
Okay. what do you
do with your wife?

235
00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:42.517
This is my wife Linda. Chad.

236
00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:46.437
I see rubbing
the cradle back then.

237
00:10:46.437 --> 00:10:48.022
-Hey. Chad. I'm Jacob.
-Hey.

238
00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:50.066
I already know
I look good for my joke.

239
00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:54.779
No. no. you look like
a Jewish Ben Stiller.

240
00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.407
You're right mom.
he's a real card.

241
00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:01.619
Well. my frat voted me ask clown
if that means anything.

242
00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.288
-It really does. yeah.
-Who's hungry?

243
00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:04.873
Yes. come on in.

244
00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:07.041
Come on in.
Linda made a beautiful feast.

245
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:11.171
(bright upbeat music)

246
00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:17.051
So. Chad. Sarah tells us
you're in finance.

247
00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:20.054
Yeah. well. real estate.
financing.

248
00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:23.933
Crypto. NFTs. PCP.
follow the money.

249
00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:25.560
you know how it is.

250
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.437
Not really. our family has been
in the same business

251
00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.772
for three generations actually.

252
00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:32.400
Well actuaries.
that's another sector I crashed.

253
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.821
Cool. do you know
who is from the SV?

254
00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.114
Oh. here we go.

255
00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:41.367
Rachel and Becky Baum.

256
00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.535
Oh. the cooks.

257
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.537
The chefs. but yes. yes.

258
00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.039
They used to come
into our bakery

259
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:47.457
every single day after school.

260
00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.501
They loved my rugelach.

261
00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:52.545
it's probably
why they became chefs.

262
00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.797
My husband.
inspiration to the stars.

263
00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:57.133
Hey. hey. hey. it ain't bragging
if it's true.

264
00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:59.260
All right. we haven't let
you get a word in edgewise.

265
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.596
you must have a million
questions for us.

266
00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:06.017
(clears throat) Yeah.
there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

267
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.896
Go ahead. we're an open book.

268
00:12:14.192 --> 00:12:15.443
What's the Wi-Fi password?

269
00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.534
Okay.

270
00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:25.954
It means a lot to me
that you're here.

271
00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.670
So. when should
we tell my family.

272
00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:36.506
About what?

273
00:12:36.506 --> 00:12:38.383
That we're getting married.

274
00:12:38.383 --> 00:12:39.968
Oh. that.

275
00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:43.513
Well. Chanukah begins tomorrow.

276
00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:46.349
how about after we
light the candles?

277
00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.435
Perfect. can't wait
to wear my ring again.

278
00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:57.694
Is this a twin?

279
00:12:57.694 --> 00:13:01.823
It's a queen.
it's at least a full.

280
00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:04.826
Really. can I see the receipt?

281
00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:07.370
Come on. it's romantic.

282
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.496
Yeah.

283
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.832
(clears throat)

284
00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:15.753
(soft music)

285
00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:39.777
Babe. couldn't sleep
in the doll bed.

286
00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:41.487
rolling over to the
Double Tree with Sagar.

287
00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:44.699
back by breakfast. XO. Chad.

288
00:13:51.164 --> 00:13:53.249
There's nobody
around for miles.

289
00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:56.002
the big guy. huge dude.
grabs my camera.

290
00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:58.004
smashes it on the ground.

291
00:13:58.004 --> 00:13:59.881
hog time. he stick
a gag in my mouth.

292
00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:01.799
-Benjamin!
-Then what happened?

293
00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:05.178
Okay. so then they force me
to the ground. onto my knees.

294
00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.598
hold up their rifles
right at my head and bam.

295
00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:15.646
I wake up. it was a dream.
I fell asleep on the
Trans Siberian railway.

296
00:14:15.646 --> 00:14:17.398
You are a wise guy.

297
00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:19.817
It was a very
intense dream. Mr. B.

298
00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:22.445
My God. Jake.
did you hear Ben's story?

299
00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.655
I'm brightening the color. Mom.

300
00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:29.160
There she is. hey. sweetie.
look to stop by. Ben
from next door.

301
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.287
Not ringing any bells.

302
00:14:31.287 --> 00:14:33.873
Oh. I also go by
Benjamin if that helps.

303
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.502
Sometimes I go
by Ba. ba. ba Benny.

304
00:14:37.502 --> 00:14:39.378
if I'm performing with the Jets.

305
00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:42.799
Oh. weren't you the kid
that got stuck
in the hollow mirrors?

306
00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.592
No. I don't think so.

307
00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:49.055
Yeah. county fair.
summer of seventh grade.

308
00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:51.474
-Maybe.
-Oh. no. you'd remember.

309
00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:54.477
they had to shut it all down
and extract you
through the roof.

310
00:14:54.477 --> 00:14:57.939
Oh. so you're saying
I got to ride
for free in a helicopter

311
00:14:57.939 --> 00:15:01.275
and get my face on the
front page of the SV Courier
because that would be awesome.

312
00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:02.944
(laughs)

313
00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.987
Ben was sweet enough
to take some photos

314
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.115
of the bakery
for socialized media.

315
00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:10.284
Speaking of which.
here they are.

316
00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:12.286
hot off the press.

317
00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:17.125
The photos are in this?

318
00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:18.876
Yeah. crazy. right?

319
00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:20.294
I'm sure one of your kids
can show how to view them.

320
00:15:20.294 --> 00:15:23.172
I'm sure
they have no idea. Jake...

321
00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:24.715
Still great. Mom.

322
00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:28.719
So. who is it you
wanted me to meet?

323
00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:31.347
Oh. where is Chad?

324
00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:34.183
Don't tell me we scared him off
before the first
night of Hanukkah.

325
00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:36.435
Doesn't he want to crush
the Hanukkah sector?

326
00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:40.857
No. nobody scared anybody.
Chad just had a work thing.

327
00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:44.026
He has a lot of
business overseas
and with the time difference.

328
00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:47.530
You wanted me to meet
a business man named Chad?
Got it.

329
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.782
He's really sweet
once you get to know him.

330
00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:53.327
Greetings beggars.
I come bearing gifts.

331
00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:57.081
Feel free to take
anything you want.
I got multiple...

332
00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:58.624
How thoughtful.

333
00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:00.793
-I love panda bread.
-Yeah. who doesn't?

334
00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:04.255
You know we are right above
a bakery right this second.

335
00:16:04.255 --> 00:16:06.090
Yeah. but this one was open.

336
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.967
Yeah.

337
00:16:09.343 --> 00:16:11.304
You weren't on my flashcards.

338
00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:15.099
I'm Ben. friend of the family.
happy to make you a flashcard.

339
00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:16.726
Oh. nice to meet you. friend.

340
00:16:17.852 --> 00:16:19.270
Okay. who's ready
to hit the beach?

341
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.439
I brought my long board
and I'm stoked.

342
00:16:22.023 --> 00:16:25.651
We need to tend the bakery.
but you and Sarah
should go. enjoy.

343
00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:29.488
I actually have some work to do
for the blog holiday recipes.
get the most clicks.

344
00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:32.241
Oh. you you want
me to call Sagar
and take you to the office?

345
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:34.118
We have a fiber optic Wi-Fi.

346
00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:35.661
You know. I think
I'll just stay here and work.

347
00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:37.455
Jake. you should go with Chad.

348
00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.833
I would love to.
but the (indistinct)
is not gonna bake itself.

349
00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:42.793
Hey. man.
show Chad around town.

350
00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.545
I can hold down
the fort for one day.

351
00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:46.547
Frank. the doctor said
you should take it easy.

352
00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.674
that means less work. not more.

353
00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.093
What I think he said
was that you should
take it easy on me.

354
00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:53.221
I'm serious.
I think this is a good idea.

355
00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:56.724
You know. I can help.

356
00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:58.935
Are you sure?

357
00:16:58.935 --> 00:17:02.813
Yeah. I wanted
to grab some candid.
save Mr. B in action. anyway.

358
00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.774
(mumbles)

359
00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:06.192
Hey. hey. hey.
remember tonight
is the first night of Hanukkah.

360
00:17:06.192 --> 00:17:08.194
I wanna see
all your lovely faces

361
00:17:08.194 --> 00:17:10.071
back here at sunset
for the lightning
of the menorah.

362
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:14.825
(playful music playing)

363
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:23.209
Yes.

364
00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:26.462
Hey.

365
00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:27.922
Sarah. bear.

366
00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.509
What was the all that
about dad and the doctor?

367
00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:39.183
As hard as it is to believe.

368
00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:43.437
your parents are aging and...

369
00:17:43.437 --> 00:17:44.814
Is he sick?

370
00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:49.610
No. but he has
to be more careful

371
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:51.904
about everything these days.

372
00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:56.075
What he eats. what he drinks.
how hard he works.
how hard he plays.

373
00:17:57.243 --> 00:17:59.287
Thankfully. we have Jacob

374
00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:02.623
and your brother's just doing
more and more every year. so.

375
00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:04.208
Is that what Jacob wants?

376
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.713
Right? I think he'd tell us
if he was unhappy.

377
00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:13.759
Well. what can I do?
I mean. I'm here to help.
I wanna do something.

378
00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:19.307
You're doing everything.
you're gonna create the best
food blog there ever was

379
00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:23.269
and slap it up there on .net.

380
00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:30.484
(music plays on earphone)

381
00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:39.619
(cabinet door creaks)

382
00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:51.047
(knocks on door)

383
00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.092
(clears throat)

384
00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:57.887
What are you...
Haven't you ever
heard of knocking?

385
00:18:57.887 --> 00:19:00.431
(chuckles)
I knocked like five times.

386
00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:02.308
Well. I was working.

387
00:19:02.308 --> 00:19:04.685
Your dad wants me
to get some shots
of you for the new ads.

388
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.021
Highlight the family
aspect of the business.

389
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:10.441
Why are they doing
all these ads anyway?
We never used to do marketing.

390
00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:14.820
Have you walked around town
since you've been back?

391
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:16.739
No.

392
00:19:17.281 --> 00:19:20.326
Grab your shoes.
time for you to see the new SV.

393
00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:24.080
This spot. remember
what that used to be?

394
00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:27.583
-Remember Greg's?
-Greg's!

395
00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:28.668
Closed last month?

396
00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:30.252
I love Greg's.

397
00:19:30.753 --> 00:19:32.672
-And the bookstore.
-I know.

398
00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:37.510
-Remember that? It's gone.
-So unfortunate.

399
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.011
Horrible.

400
00:19:39.762 --> 00:19:41.639
What happened?

401
00:19:41.639 --> 00:19:44.100
Corporate America finally
found us. that plus internet.

402
00:19:47.228 --> 00:19:49.063
Let's scope out
the competition.

403
00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:51.399
Free sample.

404
00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.608
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

405
00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:58.906
Is this old?

406
00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:01.075
I've had better bread
on airplanes.

407
00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:04.120
I don't get it.
why is this place so busy?

408
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:06.789
Same reason
all chains are busy.

409
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:09.750
Spent a ton on marketing
and they cut corners
to keep prices low.

410
00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:13.462
There's gotta be
something we can do.

411
00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.172
Why do you think I'm here?

412
00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:17.508
Spent the last decade
traveling around the world

413
00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:20.678
and anytime I wasn't
on assignment.
I came home to the SV.

414
00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:23.305
Each time. another local
business was closed.

415
00:20:24.223 --> 00:20:25.933
came back this last summer

416
00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:29.562
and there's only a handful
of the businesses left

417
00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:30.938
from when we were kids.

418
00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:35.776
So. I decided to stay.
see if I could help save them.

419
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:38.988
The bakery.

420
00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:40.823
It's doing better than most.

421
00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:43.409
Thanks to a bunch of old Jews
who would rather starve

422
00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:45.411
than eat a black
and white cookie
your family didn't bake.

423
00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:46.912
(laughs)

424
00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:48.622
But they're getting old.

425
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:51.041
My parents?

426
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:54.545
(chuckles) Their customers.
and the younger generations.

427
00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:56.672
they leave for college
and never look back.

428
00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.050
I'm part of the problem.

429
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.136
What. no. That's not...

430
00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:06.974
You have a great life
in Chicago with Chad.

431
00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:12.646
Oh. we gotta get home.
it's almost sundown.

432
00:21:12.646 --> 00:21:14.648
Oh. time to rock the dreidel

433
00:21:14.648 --> 00:21:16.108
(laughs)

434
00:21:17.735 --> 00:21:22.740
(singing in foreign language)

435
00:21:41.717 --> 00:21:44.720
I wish Zayde Max was here.

436
00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:48.224
He is here.

437
00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:50.976
Who's ready
to get their dreidel.

438
00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:54.355
I am. I am.

439
00:21:57.775 --> 00:22:00.194
I'm sorry.
are we playing for dimes?

440
00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:02.071
It's just a way to keep score.

441
00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:05.783
Care to make it
more interesting?

442
00:22:05.783 --> 00:22:07.493
You don't even
know how to play yet.

443
00:22:07.493 --> 00:22:09.328
I assume you're gonna show me.

444
00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:12.581
It's pretty simple. really?
You just spin the dreidel.

445
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.251
So the name of the game
is spin the dreidel.

446
00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:16.377
Literally.

447
00:22:16.377 --> 00:22:17.753
It's got four sides.

448
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:21.715
shin. hei. gimel. nun.

449
00:22:21.715 --> 00:22:23.342
And depending
which way it lands.

450
00:22:23.342 --> 00:22:25.135
you either get dimes
or you lose them.

451
00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:27.763
There's one more rule. fellas.
it's a house rule.

452
00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:30.933
You land on nun.
you gotta drink some.

453
00:22:30.933 --> 00:22:35.104
(playful music playing)

454
00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:29.283
No one wants locusts. right?

455
00:23:29.283 --> 00:23:33.162
(playful music playing)

456
00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.530
Come on. come on. come on.
come on. come on. come on.

457
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.367
(speaks gibberish)

458
00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:13.243
Here we go. here we go.
here we go.

459
00:24:14.161 --> 00:24:15.329
Come on. come on.

460
00:24:15.329 --> 00:24:18.749
Yeah. whoa!

461
00:24:18.749 --> 00:24:22.711
I am the man. one. two.

462
00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:25.297
Okay. everybody.

463
00:24:27.424 --> 00:24:32.137
this man is a dreidel hustler.

464
00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.098
Guilty. guilty.

465
00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.477
The gloves are coming off.
Frank. yeah.

466
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:40.521
Oh. bring it. bring it.

467
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:43.440
-Oh. no. no.
-Come on. bring it. Bring it.

468
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.943
-Let's go. come on. bring it.

469
00:24:47.403 --> 00:24:49.029
-Dad.

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:51.532

471
00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:54.576

472
00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:56.328

00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:34.408
Could you look one more time?
It's Frank Becker.

482
00:25:34.408 --> 00:25:38.370
I don't mean to be a pain.
but we haven't heard
anything. still.

483
00:25:38.829 --> 00:25:40.164
Why are you still here?

484
00:25:41.165 --> 00:25:43.876
Out of concern.
why are you still here?

485
00:25:43.876 --> 00:25:47.755
Well. I just put my soon
to be father-in-law
in the hospital.

486
00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:49.673
Father...

487
00:25:49.673 --> 00:25:50.966
(sighs)

488
00:25:51.717 --> 00:25:53.343
Oh. wow.

489
00:25:54.344 --> 00:25:55.471
Congratulations.

490
00:25:56.305 --> 00:25:58.307
Yeah. that's not a good thing.

491
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.686
It's just that it's been hours
and we haven't heard...

492
00:26:02.686 --> 00:26:04.980
These are my children.
this is Sarah and Jacob.

493
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:06.982
could you just look up
Frank Becker?

494
00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:08.150
Frank Becker.

495
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.069
Mrs. Becker. I'm Dr. Bruce.

496
00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:15.032
Oh. Doctor. how is my Frankie.
is he gonna pull through?

497
00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:19.286
Frank is fine. but I do have
a few concerns.

498
00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:22.122
-number one being his drinking.
-(chuckles)

499
00:26:22.122 --> 00:26:24.541
His what?

500
00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:27.711
Well. we ran some tests
and his blood alcohol
levels were quite elevated.

501
00:26:28.462 --> 00:26:33.092
No. he drinks on holidays
in Bar Mitzvahs. we're Jewish.

502
00:26:33.092 --> 00:26:37.221
I see. well. my other concern
is his blood pressure.
It's a bit high.

503
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:39.014
Again. we're Jewish.

504
00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:44.478
All the same. we'd really like
to keep him here a few nights
and run some more tests.

505
00:26:45.687 --> 00:26:47.439
Well. can we see him?

506
00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:50.192
Of course. he's in recovery.
might be a bit tired.

507
00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:53.028
but should be fine. right?
Come on back.

508
00:26:53.028 --> 00:26:54.196
Oh. God.

509
00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:58.450
(somber music playing)

510
00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:05.541
What a way to spend
the Festival of Lights.

511
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.420
And more like. more like...

512
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.548
Hundred bucks says it
goes with lights out.

513
00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:15.843
-Festival of lights out.
-There it is.

514
00:27:15.843 --> 00:27:17.177
(all chucking)

515
00:27:17.177 --> 00:27:19.888
You're gonna be fine.

516
00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:23.642
[Man On TV] Here at Big Wayne's
used cars. we've got them new.
we've got...

517
00:27:23.642 --> 00:27:25.602
Oh. just seeing
if I can get the game on.

518
00:27:25.602 --> 00:27:27.479
-What game?
-Any game.

519
00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:30.566
(Frank gasps)

520
00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:32.234
Its Hanukkah week
in our kitchen.

521
00:27:32.234 --> 00:27:35.112
Vodka. Google. jelly donuts
with weird names.

522
00:27:35.112 --> 00:27:37.656
Let's show you how to make
this Hanukkah the Baum.

523
00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:42.035
and join us next week
for Christmas cookies.

524
00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:46.248
Those ladies are from Sol Viejo.

525
00:27:46.248 --> 00:27:47.332
Really?

526
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.501
Rachel and Becky Baum.

527
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:52.170
They used to come into my bakery

528
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.675
every single day after school.
love the rugelach.

529
00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:58.677
(chuckles)

530
00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:02.055
I gotta get back.

531
00:28:02.055 --> 00:28:03.807
-Wait. what are you doing?
-No. it's Hanukah. it's the
busiest time of the year.

532
00:28:03.807 --> 00:28:07.311
No. I gotta...
I can't sit here eating Jell-O.

533
00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:09.187
Dad. dad. the doctor
said you have to rest.

534
00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:11.231
Okay. so what?
The doctor's gonna
pay our mortgage

535
00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:13.567
or wave the hospital bill.

536
00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:15.777
Frank Becker. you stay
in that bed or I will never.

537
00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:17.946
and I mean never
rub your feet again.

538
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.991
You're bluffing.

539
00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:22.618
Try me.

540
00:28:22.618 --> 00:28:25.203
Dad. I can help out
at the bakery while you recover.

541
00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:28.665
And I know every
big order we have.
I'll make sure we get paid.

542
00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:30.959
Jacob.

543
00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:34.171
What. I already worked there.

544
00:28:34.171 --> 00:28:37.799
Yeah. but covering for me.

545
00:28:42.137 --> 00:28:45.724
Well. do you remember
when Zayde got sick
and you stepped up?

546
00:28:47.976 --> 00:28:49.519
Well. now it's my turn.

547
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.148
Plus. I can easily
(indistinct) it's not...

548
00:28:54.524 --> 00:28:56.818
You are such a munch.

549
00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:58.153
I can help too.

550
00:28:59.112 --> 00:29:00.113
How?

551
00:29:00.864 --> 00:29:04.076
Well. you said something
about a mortgage.

552
00:29:05.327 --> 00:29:07.704
if you're struggling
with the payments.

553
00:29:07.704 --> 00:29:11.750
I can talk to the bank
and lower the interest rate.

554
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.963
For that. I'll need the assets.
balance sheets.

555
00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:18.423
inventory. that kind of stuff.

556
00:29:19.174 --> 00:29:21.009
You'd really do that?

557
00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:25.138
Yeah. your bread and butter
is well. bread and butter.

558
00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:27.599
but this is my bread and butter.

559
00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:29.142
Chad.

560
00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:31.228
(cellphone vibrating)

561
00:29:31.228 --> 00:29:36.149
Oh. if you'll excuse us.
Sagar is here. let's go. babe.

562
00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:48.370
So. what do you think?

563
00:29:51.039 --> 00:29:53.959
Look real leather.

564
00:29:54.418 --> 00:29:55.836
Touch it. feel it.

565
00:29:58.171 --> 00:30:00.924
Sagar. you're spoiling us. huh?

566
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.970
Wait. where are we going?

567
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.972
Oh. if I'm gonna
help your family.

568
00:30:06.972 --> 00:30:08.682
I need a good night's sleep.

569
00:30:08.682 --> 00:30:10.726
And also I need
to get some work done.

570
00:30:10.726 --> 00:30:12.477
You're staying
at the hotel again?

571
00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:13.895
Bingo.

572
00:30:56.938 --> 00:30:59.066
I can't believe
that actually worked.

573
00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:02.736
What's up?

574
00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:06.490
My dad's doing okay.
in case you're wondering.

575
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:10.827
I know. I slipped out
after the doctor told you.

576
00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:14.206
You didn't say goodbye.

577
00:31:14.206 --> 00:31:17.709
Yeah. well seem like more
of an immediate family vibe.

578
00:31:19.252 --> 00:31:21.421
You're basically family.

579
00:31:21.421 --> 00:31:26.301
No. but hey Chad will be soon.
Mazel tov. by the way.

580
00:31:28.011 --> 00:31:29.721
Can we go somewhere and talk?

581
00:31:30.597 --> 00:31:32.682
It's the middle of the night.
there's nothing open.

582
00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:34.392
I know a place
that might be open.

583
00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:40.857
(bright upbeat music)

584
00:31:40.857 --> 00:31:42.734
[Ben] Haven't been here
in years.

585
00:31:44.277 --> 00:31:46.113
You know what this place
makes me think of?

586
00:31:46.696 --> 00:31:48.990
Hard lemonade
and clove cigarettes.

587
00:31:50.617 --> 00:31:53.578
Junior prom. I asked
you to be my date here.

588
00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:56.748
Yeah. and then the next day.

589
00:31:56.748 --> 00:32:01.586
Tad Yost asked you to be
his date and you said yes.

590
00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:04.047
I had a huge crush on him.

591
00:32:04.047 --> 00:32:06.299
Come on. it wasn't
like I ditched you.

592
00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:10.804
No. we all went together
and then I went home.

593
00:32:10.804 --> 00:32:14.683
and you came here with Tad Yost.

594
00:32:17.644 --> 00:32:20.147
You still mad about that.
like 20 years later?

595
00:32:20.147 --> 00:32:22.482
Mad. no.

596
00:32:22.482 --> 00:32:24.943
No. I actually learned something
really valuable from that.

597
00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:27.154
that I never want to
be anybody's backup.

598
00:32:29.156 --> 00:32:31.741
I know you'll
find someone great.

599
00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:32.909
Yeah.

600
00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:37.664
Are we okay?

601
00:32:38.707 --> 00:32:39.875
Yeah. we're good.

602
00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:43.795
We should probably get back.

603
00:32:43.795 --> 00:32:45.630
your fiance is gonna wonder
where you are.

604
00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:48.842
Come on.

605
00:32:48.842 --> 00:32:52.721
(playful Jewish music)

606
00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:01.479
(speaks foreign language)

607
00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:02.939
Where's my schmear?

608
00:33:02.939 --> 00:33:05.233
Frank always tosses
in some schmear.

609
00:33:05.233 --> 00:33:07.569
I don't think we sell
cream cheese.

610
00:33:07.569 --> 00:33:10.322
-Here you go.
-Thank you son.

611
00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:12.699
Greet your father.
I hope he feels better.

612
00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:13.783
Say a hello to Harry for me.

613
00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:16.244
We do sell cream cheese.

614
00:33:16.244 --> 00:33:18.914
No. that's Philadelphia.

615
00:33:18.914 --> 00:33:21.041
just keep it around
for Mr. Paper.

616
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.377
Got it. who's next?

617
00:33:24.377 --> 00:33:26.963
Thank you so much. thank you.

618
00:33:26.963 --> 00:33:28.590
Okay. bye.

619
00:33:31.051 --> 00:33:34.179
Okay. Linda. let's kick
the tires on this jello bean.

620
00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:38.266
Kick away. come upstairs.
I'll open the books.

621
00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:42.103
(playful music playing)

622
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:14.803
(singing in foreign language)

623
00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:19.766
(singing in foreign language)

624
00:34:19.766 --> 00:34:21.226
Thank you. honey.

625
00:34:21.226 --> 00:34:23.395
I wish your father
was still with us.

626
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:27.065
-He's not dead. Mom.
-I know. I just miss him.

627
00:34:29.567 --> 00:34:31.987
-It's gonna be okay.
-I know.

628
00:34:34.322 --> 00:34:37.742
Okay. who's ready
to spin some more. huh?

629
00:34:38.535 --> 00:34:41.037
I don't think we're gonna
do that tonight. Chad.

630
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:43.957
Nun. you have to drink.

631
00:34:50.463 --> 00:34:53.633
So. how's it going
with the accounting stuff?

632
00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:55.468
I think it's going well. Chad?

633
00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:59.055
I'm gonna stop by the bank later
and talk shop with the suits.

634
00:34:59.055 --> 00:35:01.933
Thanks. babe. I mean so much.

635
00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:03.560
I do have a question.

636
00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:07.689
this bakery
has been in the family
for three generations. right?

637
00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:10.025
Why do you still
have a mortgage?

638
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:12.861
We took out a loan
when Sarah got into college.

639
00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:17.490
Oh. college. well.
where do you go to college?

640
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:20.619
At the Becker
Culinary Institute.

641
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:25.373
-Where's that?
-It's downstairs.

642
00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:29.294
Our Zayde passed away
the summer
Jake graduated high school.

643
00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:32.172
Zayde ran the bakery.
so when my dad took over.

644
00:35:32.172 --> 00:35:34.257
he asked Jake
to stay and help out.

645
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.177
Well. financially speaking.
it's a good thing

646
00:35:37.177 --> 00:35:39.387
you both didn't go
to fancy colleges.

647
00:35:39.387 --> 00:35:44.351
once it is Panda.
put a bagel size hole
in your finance.

648
00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:47.312
Anything you can do to help.
we appreciate Chad.

649
00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:50.106
No. should we tell them?

650
00:35:51.775 --> 00:35:53.068
Tell us what?

651
00:35:53.068 --> 00:35:55.445
Nothing. not nothing. something.

652
00:35:55.445 --> 00:35:58.323
but not now. when my dad's back.

653
00:36:00.283 --> 00:36:01.409
I'll get it.

654
00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:11.127
Just came to drop
something off for your mom.

655
00:36:11.127 --> 00:36:13.588
-[Linda] Is that Ben?
-Yeah!

656
00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:15.090
[Linda] Let him in.

657
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.883
Would you like to come in?

658
00:36:18.968 --> 00:36:21.680
Hi. sweetheart. please join us.

659
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.809
Oh. thanks Mrs. B. I can't stay.
I just wanted to drop off these.

660
00:36:25.809 --> 00:36:27.644
I got some great photos
for the new ads.

661
00:36:27.644 --> 00:36:28.770
I'm glad you're here.

662
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.106
-You are?
-You are?

663
00:36:31.106 --> 00:36:35.151
Yeah. you know. Linda
and I discussed it
and we agreed to put a freeze

664
00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:39.572
to all non-essential expenses.
no more photos.

665
00:36:39.572 --> 00:36:41.991
Oh. well.
I wasn't charging for these.

666
00:36:41.991 --> 00:36:45.745
Yeah. but it cost money
to use them.

667
00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:50.125
ads. marketing materials.
printing cost. ah. it adds up.

668
00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:54.045
Well. you can still keep
the photos in. use them later.

669
00:36:54.713 --> 00:36:59.050
I guess you're
not understanding.
look. no more photos.

670
00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:03.096
Okay. the thing
is that I promised Frank.

671
00:37:03.096 --> 00:37:05.056
Yeah. do you see Frank?

672
00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:09.227
Frank. Frank. Frank. Frank.

673
00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:11.062
Frank. Frank.

674
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:15.024
Not here. no Frank. no photos.

675
00:37:15.024 --> 00:37:17.986
Okay. I'm gonna go.
happy Hanukkah everybody.

676
00:37:17.986 --> 00:37:19.946
-Sweetheart...
-Ben. wait.

677
00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:22.490
Let him go.
this between the family.

678
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:23.658
not the neighbors.

679
00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:35.003
Thank you my good man.

680
00:37:35.003 --> 00:37:38.882
Remember Frank.
take it easy. all right?

681
00:37:38.882 --> 00:37:41.050
No strenuous activity.

682
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.970
you need to get lots of rest
and keep your
stress levels down.

683
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:46.055
Mainly you need to relax.

684
00:37:46.055 --> 00:37:48.558
Can I get that in writing
so I can show my wife?

685
00:37:48.558 --> 00:37:50.685
-I'm serious. Frank.
-Thank you. Doc.

686
00:37:54.397 --> 00:37:56.357
And you.

687
00:37:56.357 --> 00:38:01.112
ah. Dr. Bruce. my stress
levels are rising.

688
00:38:01.112 --> 00:38:03.907
Is this right?

689
00:38:03.907 --> 00:38:05.950
Thirty thousand dollars.
this is crazy.

690
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:09.704
That ambulance ride cost
more than our entire honeymoon.
go figure.

691
00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:11.706
God. $15 for an aspirin.

692
00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:16.628
To be fair. it was two aspirin
and it did the trick.

693
00:38:16.628 --> 00:38:18.421
How are we gonna pay for this?

694
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:20.507
I think we've gotta ask Chad.

695
00:38:20.507 --> 00:38:22.509
Poor kid. he just met us

696
00:38:22.509 --> 00:38:25.011
and now we're dragging him
to our family mishigas.

697
00:38:25.011 --> 00:38:27.305
He wants to help.
he's at the bank as we speak.

698
00:38:28.223 --> 00:38:29.390
Grab my foot.

699
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.480
(phone ringing)

700
00:38:38.358 --> 00:38:40.652
These numbers are not great.

701
00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:43.321
Yeah. tell me about it.
what can we do?

702
00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:45.406
Depends on the angle.

703
00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:49.160
Bottom line. I don't
want my future in laws
to be homeless.

704
00:38:50.328 --> 00:38:52.539
What'd you say
the address was?

705
00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:54.833
263 Valencia Street.

706
00:38:56.835 --> 00:38:58.253
I'm in real estate.

707
00:39:03.216 --> 00:39:05.093
one block from main.

708
00:39:05.093 --> 00:39:07.637
Yeah. and great building too.
I checked with the county.

709
00:39:07.637 --> 00:39:12.308
It was built 1948.
a post-war classic.

710
00:39:12.308 --> 00:39:15.436
-Good bones I bet.
-Great bones.

711
00:39:16.354 --> 00:39:18.857
So what's the play here?

712
00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:23.403
Technically. the bank
holds the building.
so you tell me.

713
00:39:25.238 --> 00:39:27.073
Alpha by Delta.

714
00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:33.580
Alpha man flourish
across the land.
take that rich bounty. woo.

715
00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:37.876
I'm sure we can
work something out.

716
00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:40.295
-Hey. my man.
-Knock it out.

717
00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:50.930
(singing in foreign language)

718
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:55.393
(singing in foreign language)

719
00:39:56.477 --> 00:40:01.274
(singing in foreign language)

720
00:40:01.274 --> 00:40:05.695
(singing in foreign language)

721
00:40:05.695 --> 00:40:09.073
Thank. you son.
that was beautiful.

722
00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:12.911
Okay. if I could have
everyone's attention.

723
00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.707
Up. oh. up is good. right?

724
00:40:17.707 --> 00:40:20.084
These are your expenses. Frank.

725
00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:22.754
Where do he get the pointer?

726
00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:24.297
I think he travels with it.

727
00:40:24.297 --> 00:40:26.299
Can we keep the chit-chat
to a minimum?

728
00:40:26.299 --> 00:40:27.967
Sorry.

729
00:40:30.386 --> 00:40:33.389
This are your profits.

730
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:38.227
Wait. sorry.
I don't understand.
business is fine.

731
00:40:38.227 --> 00:40:41.898
Yeah. but the cost
of doing business
has risen over the years.

732
00:40:41.898 --> 00:40:46.569
Meanwhile. your prices
have not changed enough

733
00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:49.155
-to cover that difference.
-Chad. we get by.

734
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:54.285
Yeah. but the hospital bill
changed all that.

735
00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:56.329
(laughs)

736
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:58.164
That's you.

737
00:40:58.164 --> 00:41:03.044
So. what are you saying?
That we have
to raise our prices?

738
00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:09.092
Okay. price of a bagel.
no longer 50 cents. 75 cents.

739
00:41:09.092 --> 00:41:11.803
For a plain bagel.
are you insane?

740
00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:14.722
It's too late for that.
you would have
to charge $5 a bagel.

741
00:41:14.722 --> 00:41:17.141
it's allowed every day
to even make a dent.

742
00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:19.936
So what are you saying?
We're finished. kaput?

743
00:41:19.936 --> 00:41:21.813
Not yet.

744
00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:26.985
This is the real estate
market in downtown Sol Viejo.

745
00:41:26.985 --> 00:41:28.403
Oh. great.

746
00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:31.489
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

747
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.741
what does this have to do
with saving the bakery?

748
00:41:36.077 --> 00:41:38.329
Not save. sell.

749
00:41:39.205 --> 00:41:41.416
He wants us to sell the bakery.

750
00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:44.252
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa.

751
00:41:44.252 --> 00:41:48.506
sell Becker Family Breads.
and then what?

752
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:49.757
We move to Boca Raton?

753
00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:52.260
You would make enough
profit in the business.

754
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.262
Boca Raton is totally doable.

755
00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:55.972
Yeah. okay. I've heard enough.

756
00:41:55.972 --> 00:41:57.515
No. stop it.
he's only trying to help.

757
00:41:57.515 --> 00:41:59.684
-How is this helping?
-I don't know.

758
00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:03.187
Frank. with the hospital bills
plus the bakeries expenses.

759
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:04.605
you don't have enough
in the accounts

760
00:42:04.605 --> 00:42:06.107
to pay the next
mortgage payment.

761
00:42:06.107 --> 00:42:07.525
It's due a week.

762
00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:09.110
How short are we?

763
00:42:14.949 --> 00:42:17.785
Okay. so we have
until the end of Hanukkah

764
00:42:17.785 --> 00:42:20.705
to raise $40.000. no problem.

765
00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:25.585
You haven't had
a $40.000 month since ever.

766
00:42:25.585 --> 00:42:28.838
we are talking about
a $40.000 week. friend.

767
00:42:28.838 --> 00:42:31.466
So what. youknow the Maccabees.

768
00:42:31.466 --> 00:42:35.303
they had enough oil
for one night. it lasted eight.

769
00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:38.347
I have no idea
what that means.

770
00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:42.643
I know what it means Chad.
it doesn't make any sense.

771
00:42:42.643 --> 00:42:44.687
There has to be another way.

772
00:42:44.687 --> 00:42:47.523
If you don't make
these payment to the bank.

773
00:42:47.523 --> 00:42:50.526
they seize the property
and sell it themselves.

774
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:52.653
You know. okay.
then let's get baking.

775
00:42:52.653 --> 00:42:55.281
Okay. Jacob. Jacob.
go fire up the oven.

776
00:42:55.281 --> 00:42:57.033
Honey. I want you to
go into my office.

777
00:42:57.033 --> 00:42:58.826
find a file marked
corporate clients.

778
00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:01.245
I want you to call every
single one of them tomorrow

779
00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:04.832
and tell them that we
are gonna have a special
on catering holiday parties.

780
00:43:06.042 --> 00:43:07.502
Dad. what can I do?

781
00:43:08.878 --> 00:43:11.214
Just being here is enough.

782
00:43:13.174 --> 00:43:14.467
(soft music playing)

783
00:43:14.467 --> 00:43:17.053
(keyboard clacking)

784
00:43:18.763 --> 00:43:23.643
(music continues to play)

785
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:14.569
If you didn't wanna be
my backup plan.
how come you never ask me out?

786
00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:16.487
(chuckles)

787
00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:20.825
Well. there are a few reasons.

788
00:44:20.825 --> 00:44:21.951
which one do you want to hear?

789
00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:23.369
Start with number one.

790
00:44:24.453 --> 00:44:27.582
Okay. well you
were my first kiss.

791
00:44:27.582 --> 00:44:30.960
summer after seventh grade.
Camp Shalom.

792
00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:33.045
Same.

793
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.048
When we got back from camp.

794
00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:39.510
things were weird
between us for like a month.

795
00:44:40.636 --> 00:44:44.348
We were 13. kissing
is weird when you're 13.

796
00:44:45.308 --> 00:44:46.392
Okay. fair.

797
00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:50.438
but it wasn't
the last time we kissed.

798
00:44:50.438 --> 00:44:52.064
There were three more.

799
00:44:52.064 --> 00:44:54.483
Very good. Halloween.
ninth grade.

800
00:44:54.483 --> 00:44:55.610
I was Hermione.

801
00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.987
I was Bob Dylan.

802
00:44:57.987 --> 00:45:00.573
You grabbed me and kissed me.
but you wouldn't take
off your sunglasses

803
00:45:00.573 --> 00:45:02.408
'cause you were so cool.

804
00:45:02.408 --> 00:45:04.911
No. I was so nervous.

805
00:45:04.911 --> 00:45:07.455
I remember thinking
that if you rejected me.

806
00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:09.290
I was gonna reject
you back and say.

807
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:11.042
how does it feel?

808
00:45:18.132 --> 00:45:19.675
Third time I kissed you.

809
00:45:22.428 --> 00:45:23.763
in the cemetery.

810
00:45:24.847 --> 00:45:26.224
You were confused.

811
00:45:29.518 --> 00:45:31.020
And I was sad.

812
00:45:33.064 --> 00:45:36.984
Your bubbe was.
she was the greatest.

813
00:45:40.363 --> 00:45:41.906
She was my best friend.

814
00:45:43.866 --> 00:45:44.992
I know

815
00:45:48.454 --> 00:45:52.458
And then when she was gone.
you were my best friend.

816
00:45:54.335 --> 00:45:55.670
That's what you needed.

817
00:45:56.712 --> 00:45:58.256
I didn't wanna let you down.

818
00:46:00.466 --> 00:46:04.762
Boyfriends come and go.
but you needed a best friend.

819
00:46:12.853 --> 00:46:15.940
You still did kiss me
one more time.

820
00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.068
Oh. yeah. well that time
I had no choice.

821
00:46:19.068 --> 00:46:20.403
Why?

822
00:46:20.403 --> 00:46:21.946
Well. you were
oing to college.

823
00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:24.282
So?

824
00:46:24.282 --> 00:46:28.411
So. wondered if I never
saw you again?

825
00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:34.500
I wasn't gonna miss my last
chance to kiss Sarah Becker.

837

So. the temple placed
a big Shabbat order. $800.

838
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.882
Oh. and you know Barbara.

839
00:47:22.882 --> 00:47:25.343
she's been doing my hair
since the last millennium.

840
00:47:25.343 --> 00:47:26.802
-Oh. yeah.
-So she's retiring...

841

Honey. I'm sorry
about your hair.

842

focus here. okay?

843

Eye on the prize.

844
00:47:32.016 --> 00:47:34.894
And the salon is throwing her
a retirement party.

845
00:47:34.894 --> 00:47:37.146
and they gave us
the order. $300.

846
00:47:37.146 --> 00:47:40.733
Ah. oh. that's great.
anything else?

847

that's $1.000 down.

848
00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:47.656
$39.000 to go.
who's next. Jacob?

849
00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:50.326
What's up?

850
00:47:50.326 --> 00:47:51.494
What do you got for us?

851
00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:53.954
What was I supposed to do?

852
00:47:55.331 --> 00:47:57.958
Come up with an idea
to help us save the bakery.

853
00:47:59.502 --> 00:48:02.880
Oh. okay. how about this?

854
00:48:04.048 --> 00:48:06.008
Instead of going to college.

855
00:48:06.008 --> 00:48:08.010
I'll just spend
my life working here

856
00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.055
six days a week for no pay.

857
00:48:11.055 --> 00:48:15.184
just room and board.
and that's my final offer.

858
00:48:15.184 --> 00:48:16.435
(laughs)

859
00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:18.479
Deal.

860
00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:21.816
Okay. just make sure
she's firing

861
00:48:21.816 --> 00:48:24.985
on all cylinders
this week. all right?

862
00:48:24.985 --> 00:48:27.780
Okay. so. Chad.
how did it go to the bank?

863
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.865
Any luck getting us
the extension?

864
00:48:29.865 --> 00:48:32.243
Heading over there
as soon as we wrap up here.

865
00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:33.786
taking the suits out to lunch.

866
00:48:33.786 --> 00:48:36.372
Great. schmooze
them until they cave.

867
00:48:37.248 --> 00:48:39.291
That sounds illegal. Frank.

868
00:48:39.291 --> 00:48:40.960
It just means
turn on the charm.

869
00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.711
Oh. no problem.

870
00:48:43.295 --> 00:48:47.800
Excellent. okay. that leaves
Ben and Sarah.

871
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.387
I spoke to the SV Courier
this morning.
told them what's going on.

872
00:48:51.387 --> 00:48:52.888
they offered to run
a free ad for the bakery

873
00:48:52.888 --> 00:48:55.057
all the rest of Hanukkah.
half page.

874
00:48:55.057 --> 00:48:58.060
-It's wonderful.
-I'm gonna turn the
blog into a giant ad

875
00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.562
for the bakery all week.

876
00:48:59.562 --> 00:49:02.314
The theme is family.
friends and food.

877
00:49:02.314 --> 00:49:03.983
Becker Family Breads
through the years.

878
00:49:03.983 --> 00:49:05.484
-Oh...
-[Linda] I love that.

879
00:49:05.484 --> 00:49:07.111
And. Mom.
do you have any pictures

880
00:49:07.111 --> 00:49:09.280
of Bubbe and Zayde
when they ran the bakery?

881
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.115
Do we know each other?

882
00:49:11.824 --> 00:49:15.411
Well. I'm gonna need those.
and then pictures of me
and Jake when we were kids.

883
00:49:15.411 --> 00:49:17.413
I don't have any.

884
00:49:18.372 --> 00:49:21.041
And if anyone has
an idea for a hashtag.

885
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:23.335
we wanna get something
trending on social media.

886
00:49:23.335 --> 00:49:25.504
Hash. hash. hash what?

887
00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:30.426
-You know. the
number sign. Frank?
-$40.000. that's the number.

888
00:49:30.426 --> 00:49:33.888
Hashtag $40.000
by Shabbat. how's that?

889
00:49:35.514 --> 00:49:37.516
You know. Ben and I
can figure it out.

890
00:49:37.516 --> 00:49:39.393
Yeah. we got it.

891
00:49:39.393 --> 00:49:42.521
All right. great. so come on.
people. let's get to work.

892
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:45.274
(playful music playing)

893
00:50:49.129 --> 00:50:51.840
Right. okay. okay.

894
00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:52.967
Thank. you everyone.

895
00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:55.594
And we have three more
orders for tomorrow.

896
00:50:55.594 --> 00:50:57.638
Ugh. that's my girl.

897
00:50:57.638 --> 00:50:59.932
Chad. any progress
with the bank?

898
00:50:59.932 --> 00:51:02.685
I think we are
getting somewhere.

899
00:51:02.685 --> 00:51:04.228
-should know more soon.
-Okay.

900
00:51:04.228 --> 00:51:07.189
Sarah. whatever happened
with that tick tack toe.

901
00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:09.400
Oh. the hashtag raise dough?

902
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.944
-We got it trending?
-Is that good?

903
00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:16.907
Unfortunately. it hasn't
translated into any business.

904
00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:18.576
Was it supposed to?

905
00:51:19.285 --> 00:51:21.161
Yeah. Dad.
that's the whole point.

906
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:25.958
But wait a minute.
that is not social networking

907
00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:27.501
for Jews of a certain age.

908
00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:30.754
I mean. they don't get
the news from Face Jam.

909
00:51:32.047 --> 00:51:34.758
-Face Jam?
-Well. we put an ad
in the courier

910
00:51:34.758 --> 00:51:36.176
if that's what you meant.

911
00:51:36.176 --> 00:51:37.886
No. wait. wait.
hold on. hold on.

912
00:51:37.886 --> 00:51:39.346
Linda. honey. when you
go to get your hair done.

913
00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:41.056
what do the ladies talk about?

914
00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:43.017
It's two subjects.
they talk about their children

915
00:51:43.017 --> 00:51:44.226
and their grand children.

916
00:51:44.226 --> 00:51:47.062
Uh-huh. Huh. huh?

917
00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:51.025
Jewish geography.

918
00:51:51.025 --> 00:51:55.446
Boom. you want all the people
who have been here
over the years

919
00:51:55.446 --> 00:51:58.532
to come back and help.
support Becker Family Breads.
okay?

920
00:51:58.532 --> 00:52:02.536
So you use the oldest slash
youngest social network

921
00:52:02.536 --> 00:52:05.873
in the world.
Jewish Grandchildren.

922
00:52:08.167 --> 00:52:12.880
Okay. so do we just start
calling kids from school?

923
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.632
Do you even remember
who was Jewish?

924
00:52:14.632 --> 00:52:17.593
No. we could go by last names.

925
00:52:17.593 --> 00:52:19.470
Yeah. but that could get tricky.

926
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.764
I've been to like two
Kirk Patrick Bar Mitzvahs.

927
00:52:21.764 --> 00:52:23.807
-Good point.
-Yeah.

928
00:52:23.807 --> 00:52:26.727
Oh. I got it.

929
00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:31.565
Camp Shalom.

930
00:52:31.565 --> 00:52:35.027
Duh. everyone at
summer camp was Jewish.

931
00:52:35.027 --> 00:52:36.695
Even the people who weren't.

932
00:52:38.322 --> 00:52:42.534
Guess it's finally
time to reconnect
with me Old Color War tribe.

933
00:52:42.534 --> 00:52:44.536
Okay. I'll start with Abrams.

934
00:52:44.536 --> 00:52:46.830
you start with Zimmerman
and we'll meet in the middle.

935
00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:49.166
Okay. except let me
trade you Stacy Rothman

936
00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:51.543
for Evan Cohen.
'cause I don't think
either of us

937
00:52:51.543 --> 00:52:53.337
-wants to make those calls.
-No. I don't. I really
don't wanna talk to him.

938
00:53:07.518 --> 00:53:10.479
I remember the first day
you came to work with me.

939
00:53:10.479 --> 00:53:13.107
Yeah. I was 16 years old.
I wanted a car.

940
00:53:13.107 --> 00:53:15.567
Can you hand me
the bench scraper. please.

941
00:53:16.944 --> 00:53:20.072
You had just turned six.

942
00:53:20.072 --> 00:53:22.574
it was me who wanted something.
not you.

943
00:53:24.076 --> 00:53:25.452
What did you want?

944
00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:30.332
I had just been offered
a job in Denver.

945
00:53:30.332 --> 00:53:35.254
pastry chef at a five star
restaurant. my own kitchen.

946
00:53:37.089 --> 00:53:39.216
I wanted out of the bakery.

947
00:53:41.635 --> 00:53:43.095
You wanted out?

948
00:53:43.846 --> 00:53:45.431
Very much so.

949
00:53:47.391 --> 00:53:49.601
Brought you with me that day

950
00:53:49.601 --> 00:53:52.771
because I had finally
worked up the courage
to tell your Zayde.

951
00:53:53.939 --> 00:53:56.233
I was just a kid.
you needed my help?

952
00:53:57.526 --> 00:54:01.947
Sort of. nothing made my
father happier than seeing you

953
00:54:01.947 --> 00:54:03.365
and your sister.

954
00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:05.534
thought if he was
in a good mood.

955
00:54:05.534 --> 00:54:08.412
maybe he'd be more willing
to go along with the plan.
(chuckles)

956
00:54:10.998 --> 00:54:12.958
Was seeing me really
that big a deal?

957
00:54:13.876 --> 00:54:17.588
Oh. yeah. especially
after bubbe got sick.

958
00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:23.802
My father worked
seven days a week

959
00:54:23.802 --> 00:54:25.679
the last 15 years of his life.

960
00:54:27.014 --> 00:54:30.476
He only saw you
on Jewish holidays
when you came to the bakery.

961
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.190
-Can I ask you something?
-Of course.

962
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:38.275
What happened.
what did he say?

963
00:54:40.819 --> 00:54:42.613
He didn't say anything. Jacob.

964
00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:45.908
because I never told him.

965
00:54:52.706 --> 00:54:54.666
It took me years to forgive him

966
00:54:54.666 --> 00:54:58.587
for not reading my mind
that day.

967
00:55:00.923 --> 00:55:02.508
Imagine that.

968
00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:15.812
Ruben. my man. we really.
really could use your support

969
00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:17.648
at Becker Family Breads.

970
00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:20.526

Melissa Kaufman says hi.

996
00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:33.015
As does Tracy Kramer.

997
00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:34.641
We did it. that's everyone.

998
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:37.144
Nice.

999
00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.695
Jewish geography. right?

1000
00:56:46.695 --> 00:56:48.196
More like Jewish pornography.

1001
00:56:49.114 --> 00:56:50.657
Chad.

1002
00:56:50.657 --> 00:56:52.409
I think it's time
for a family meeting.

1003
00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:55.787
Oh. stick around. Ben.
you are practically family.

1004
00:56:55.787 --> 00:56:59.666
Becker family.
I have big news to share.

1005
00:57:02.878 --> 00:57:06.548
Okay. you asked for my help
and I've come up with the plan.

1006
00:57:06.548 --> 00:57:09.468
Is everyone familiar
with the concept win-win?

1007
00:57:09.468 --> 00:57:11.178
Nope.

1008
00:57:11.178 --> 00:57:15.223
Is where you win and I win.
sounds fair. right?

1009
00:57:15.223 --> 00:57:17.434
What exactly are
you winning. Chad?

1010
00:57:17.434 --> 00:57:22.230
Your bank payment
is due four days
and you're not gonna make it.

1011
00:57:22.689 --> 00:57:23.857
Great pep talk.

1012
00:57:23.857 --> 00:57:25.484
But that's the bad news.

1013
00:57:25.484 --> 00:57:28.612
but the good news
is I can make it.

1014
00:57:28.612 --> 00:57:31.531
What. are you willing
to loan us that money?

1015
00:57:32.157 --> 00:57:35.202
I thought about that.
but very little upset for me.

1016
00:57:35.202 --> 00:57:37.621
remember the name of
the game is win-win.

1017
00:57:38.205 --> 00:57:39.831
Okay. so what?

1018
00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:41.833
Ah. two part plan.

1019
00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:46.338
Part one. I'm marrying
your daughter.

1020
00:57:48.048 --> 00:57:52.678
I've already proposed. she
accepted that deal is closed.

1021
00:57:54.304 --> 00:57:57.766
Part two. hasn't happened yet.

1022
00:57:57.766 --> 00:58:00.852
but it will as soon as
you default on your loan.

1023
00:58:00.852 --> 00:58:02.479
I've already made
a deal with the bank

1024
00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:05.148
to purchase the building.
Sarah gets me.

1025
00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:10.112
I get the building property
stays in the family. win-win.

1026
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:15.659
Okay. say we agree to this.

1027
00:58:15.659 --> 00:58:17.494
No. there's
nothing to agree to.

1028
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:20.038
What happens to the bakery?
You don't own the bakery?

1029
00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:22.207
Oh no. no. no. no.
that's all yours.

1030
00:58:22.207 --> 00:58:24.292
Okay. so how does that work?

1031
00:58:24.292 --> 00:58:27.754
We live up here.
we work down there
and what we pay you rent?

1032
00:58:27.754 --> 00:58:30.090
We can get into
those details later.

1033
00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:33.093
I'd like to get into
those details now. Chad.

1034
00:58:33.093 --> 00:58:36.263
Oh. well I'll have to talk
to my business partners.

1035
00:58:36.263 --> 00:58:38.014
Oh. now he's got partners.

1036
00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:40.350
Yeah. to see the rent comps
in the area.

1037
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:43.270
but if you wanna stay.
I'm sure we can work...

1038
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:44.980
Okay. Chad. yeah.
you know what?

1039
00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.023
I am so glad that you
gave us this presentation.

1040
00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:48.859
Because of you.
I'm gonna make sure

1041
00:58:48.859 --> 00:58:53.113
that Becker Family Breads
has its first $40.000 week ever.

1042
00:58:53.113 --> 00:58:54.364
Me too.

1043
00:58:56.408 --> 00:58:57.784
Our surfing secret is off.

1044
00:58:58.410 --> 00:58:59.786
No.

1045
00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:02.330
Yeah. oh. it's happening.

1046
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:05.208
this man wore a wet suit
on a boogie board.

1047
00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.127
Bro code. dude.

1048
00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:09.212
No. congratulations
on marrying my sister.

1049
00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:14.760
She's the greatest.

1050
00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:19.264
-[Chad] What?
-I gotta go bake. but you
all need to get some sleep.

1051
00:59:19.264 --> 00:59:22.350

Welcome back to the Baum.

1079
01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:45.559
Before the break. we added
the pumpkin mixture to pasta.

1080
01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:48.144
and sprinkled
a little everything
with some bread crumbs.

1081
01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:50.355
Now let's bake our creamy
winter pumpkin pasta

1082
01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:52.107
for 15 minutes.

1083
01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:57.112
TV Gods. dissolve us
15 minutes into the future.

1084
01:01:00.198 --> 01:01:02.409
And now. we should
have a nice golden crisp.

1085
01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:03.952
let's take a look.

1086
01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:06.121
Can already smell
the wintery warmth.

1087
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:09.040
Cut.

1088
01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:12.252
Where's our sous chef?

1089
01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.879
Does anyone have eyes on Scott?

1090
01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:15.505
Why does this keep
happening Alice?

1091
01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.756
Does Scott hate us?

1092
01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:18.425
Tell us the truth.

1093
01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.634
I don't speak for Scott.

1094
01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:23.471
Okay. but say you did.
say you were Scott.

1095
01:01:23.471 --> 01:01:24.764
what would you say?

1096
01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:28.977
Shoot. I overslept again.

1097
01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:32.898
I hope those nice ladies
don't fire my lazy ass.

1098
01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:35.358
Oh. wait. who am I kidding?

1099
01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.152
They're total pushovers.

1100
01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:41.031
I've been late like 10 times now
and I'm still employed.

1101
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:44.743
-Hell. yeah...
-And scene. thank you. Alice.

1102
01:01:44.743 --> 01:01:46.494
-Let's take five.
-Let's take five.

1103
01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:51.416
The network called
they wanna discuss
your new weightless Mondays.

1104
01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:52.751
What. did we upset Big Cattle?

1105
01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:53.877
Hey. Layla.

1106
01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:56.087
-Layla.
-Hi. Mrs. Baum.

1107
01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:00.383
When did you put out
this guacamole?

1108
01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.843
I just put it out.

1109
01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:04.262
Why is it brown?

1110
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:06.932
I think it's just the lighting.

1111
01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:11.895
Okay. well. why don't
we take a taste and see.

1112
01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:14.397
I'm good.

1113
01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:17.525
No. you're good. me too.
let's take a taste. cheers.

1114
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:31.164
It's good. it was the lighting.
my apologies.

1115
01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:34.793
Becky. your therapist called
to confirm your
session on Thursday.

1116
01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:36.628
Oh. okay.

1117
01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:38.797
You're going to a therapist.
are you talking about me?

1118
01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:40.382
What are you saying about me?

1119
01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.592
It's for my knee.

1120
01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:44.344
Oh. which one?

1121
01:02:45.553 --> 01:02:46.721
Bad one.

1122
01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:49.557
I haven't seen you limping.

1123
01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:51.559
She's a really good therapist.

1124
01:02:51.559 --> 01:02:54.104
-And your mother called.
-What does she want?

1125
01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:55.814
Well. she said
it was something important

1126
01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:57.941
and to call her
back immediately.

1127
01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:00.860
Well. important means either
like somebody died or...

1128
01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.612
Somebody else's kid did
something more impressive

1129
01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.406
than creating their
own food empire.

1130
01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:06.992
Poo. poo. poo.
let's hope somebody died.

1131
01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:11.079
Yeah. Alice. just tell our mom
that we really
wanna talk to her.

1132
01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:15.458
but we can't because...

1133
01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:17.752
We're being silenced
by Big Cattle.

1134
01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:22.257
(intense music playing)

1135
01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:28.263
(music continues to play)

1136
01:04:11.973 --> 01:04:14.059
Thank you. thank you.

1137
01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:20.190
Take a walk with me.

1138
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.859
(laughs)

1139
01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:27.906
Can I see the ring?

1140
01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:32.160
Very pretty.

1141
01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:35.705
I'm not really thinking
about it right now.

1142
01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:36.998
You should be.

1143
01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:39.793
The bakery. there's still time
that we can...

1144
01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:42.003
You know what my
mother said to me
before I married your father.

1145
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.421
He'll do.

1146
01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:49.844
Very funny. she said.
this is the most
important decision

1147
01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:51.805
a person ever makes.

1148
01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:54.057
Things were different
in grandma's time.

1149
01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:57.185
It was. but she was right.

1150
01:04:57.185 --> 01:05:01.731
Jobs. careers.
homes. even bakeries.

1151
01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.149
they come and go.

1152
01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:05.610
marriage is for the rest
of your life.

1153
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:08.696
What are you saying?
That I'm making a mistake.

1154
01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:11.032
It doesn't matter
what I think. you are so smart.

1155
01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:13.118
I know you're gonna
make the right choice.

1156
01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:17.205
Not for me or your father
or Becker Family Breads.
for you.

1157
01:05:19.124 --> 01:05:22.669
Well. what if marrying Chad
is the only way
for us to save the bakery?

1158
01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:26.631
I mean. if he's my husband.
he'll obviously let us keep it.
right?

1159
01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:32.720
Why don't you ask him?

1160
01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.564
What's going on?
Who are these men?

1161
01:05:42.564 --> 01:05:44.774
These are my partners.
I told you about them.

1162
01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.609
Why are they
measuring the walls.

1163
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.736
In case you want to put in
a salad bar.

1164
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:53.408
Chad. why are these men
in my bakery?

1165
01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.869
Frank. relax.
I told you I had partners.

1166
01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.704
they just need to get
to know the place.

1167
01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:01.833
They have to do this now?
We have customers.

1168
01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.169
We. since when are you part
of the family?

1169
01:06:08.756 --> 01:06:11.009
Okay guys. we'll start upstairs.

1170
01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:13.553
Wait. you're
measuring our bedrooms.

1171
01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:16.890
Those men are from Panda.

1172
01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:22.437
Chad isn't buying this bakery.
Panda Breads is.

1173
01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:26.900
Sagar. this is a violation
of driver-passenger privilege.

1174
01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.819
All week I've been
driving this jerk around.

1175
01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:33.239
all he does is make plans
to take this bakery
from the Beckers.

1176
01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.824
I didn't know
you spoke English.

1177
01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:37.827
I'm from San Diego. idiot.

1178
01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:41.456
And I love Becker Family Breads
just like everyone in this town.

1179
01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:44.542
Well. I hope you like Panda.

1180
01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:49.756
Find someone else to file
your taxes jointly with.

1181
01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:52.717
Mom. this should
put us over the top.

1182
01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:57.847
It's fake sweetheart.

1183
01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.724
No. are you sure?

1184
01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:01.726
I worked at Macy's
before I met your father.

1185
01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:03.978
I know Cubic zirconia
when I see it.

1186
01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:06.231
Sorry baby.

1187
01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:10.735
I was gonna
replace it eventually.

1188
01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:22.080
All right. Becker Family Breads
is closing in 10 minutes.

1189
01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:27.210
-Place your final order.
-Hey. how did we do?

1190
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.128
Well. we're short.

1191
01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:31.923
How much?

1192
01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:34.008
Ten thousand dollars.

1193
01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.470
(chuckles)

1194
01:07:38.471 --> 01:07:40.807
Well. we had a good run.

1195
01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:42.016
We sure did.

1196
01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:43.893
Good evening. everyone.

1197
01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:47.563
if I could ask you to put
your phones in airplane mode.

1198
01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:50.024
keep them concealed
and clear the path

1199
01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:52.485
down the center
through the pastry counter.

1200
01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:54.862
I'm looking for a Frank Becker.

1201
01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:56.864
Does anyone here
know Frank Becker?

1202
01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:58.366
That's F-R-A...

1203
01:07:58.366 --> 01:08:01.035
I am Frank Becker.
can I help you miss?

1204
01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:05.373
Great. if I could
just reposition you
to the center of the counter.

1205
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:10.503
Sure. I can reposition myself.

1206
01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:12.171
Do you wanna buy something?

1207
01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:16.968
We're in position. Mezuzah
and Dredal are clear to land.

1208
01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:19.429
Okay. are you just
gonna order people around

1209
01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:21.472
or do you want to
order some food?

1210
01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:24.684
I'd like to order

1211
01:08:26.811 --> 01:08:28.855
two pieces
of rugelach. please.

1212
01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:31.316
(uplifting music)

1213
01:08:37.655 --> 01:08:40.366
Oh. my God.
look how small it is.

1214
01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:43.369
I didn't think
I could remember it.
It's small.

1215
01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:44.954
Oh. God.

1216
01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:48.207
Oh. Becky. look upstairs.

1217
01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.500
Wait a minute.

1218
01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:53.379
Hold on.
we wavered our initials.

1219
01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:54.589
That was permanent marker...

1220
01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:56.090
(indistinct chatters)

1221
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:58.760
Becky. it's exactly
the same upstairs.

1222
01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.178
Incredible.

1223
01:09:01.262 --> 01:09:04.432
This is. you're the little...
This is the little girl.

1224
01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:06.893
you're the little girl
that was running around.

1225
01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:10.188
I remember you. you were
three when we used to come here.

1226
01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:13.941
Oh. you know.

1227
01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:15.777
when we were little girls.

1228
01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:18.196
the best sound in the world

1229
01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:21.157
was that final bell
at the end of the school day.

1230
01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:24.160
everybody loves that final bell
at the end of the school day.

1231
01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:26.704
And when you're
in grade school.

1232
01:09:26.704 --> 01:09:29.749
it means you can go
play tag or climb a tree.

1233
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:34.003
when you're in middle school.
it's what's soccer
practice or the mall.

1234
01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:37.632
Yeah. and in high school
it's getting high in your car

1235
01:09:37.632 --> 01:09:40.176
or getting to second
base in your car.

1236
01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.928
or both. usually both.

1237
01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:45.890
But for us. the final bell
meant something very different.

1238
01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:50.812
It meant I was five minutes away
from the greatest
sensation in the world.

1239
01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:53.940
The fresh. fruity. cakey taste

1240
01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:57.360
of Becker's Fresh rugelach.

1241
01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.240
Drooling. you know.
we were latchkey kids.
Google it.

1242
01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.202
And we didn't know

1243
01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.662
that rugelach cost anything

1244
01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:09.163
because we didn't think
about money

1245
01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:11.249
because we didn't
have any money.

1246
01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:13.084
Now we have so much money

1247
01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:16.629
that we've like forgotten
about it again. it's weird.

1248
01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.506
It's ironic. we understand.

1249
01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:22.093
But the point is that.

1250
01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:24.679
well. we didn't know
rugelach it cost anything.

1251
01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:28.349
but it turns out.
it's 25 cents a piece.

1252
01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:31.060
and I probably
had one every day.

1253
01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.230
five days a week
for about 10 years.

1254
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:38.234
-So did I.
-It was on the house. darling.

1255
01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.612
Well. we heard the house
could use some help. Frank.

1256
01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:45.408
(sighs)

1257
01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:48.244
You don't owe me anything.

1258
01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:51.664
This is where we fell in
love with food. so. I disagree.

1259
01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:54.041
Is it Linda?

1260
01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.545
(chuckles) Yes.

1261
01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:01.132
You still the brains
behind this operation?

1262
01:11:01.132 --> 01:11:03.885
Well. I do the books.

1263
01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:08.306
Okay. what's a $1.25
a week times 10 years.

1264
01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:12.477
-Six hundred and fifty dollars
-Times two.

1265
01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:14.103
Thirteen hundred dollars.

1266
01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.063
And then interest.

1267
01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:17.523
-Oh. interest.
-Interest.

1268
01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:19.901
-So. five percent...
-Five percent interest.

1269
01:11:21.068 --> 01:11:23.988
If you insist. amortized?

1270
01:11:23.988 --> 01:11:26.407
-Yes. definitely amortized.
-Whatever that means.

1271
01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.993
Don't worry.
they won't even get close.

1272
01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:34.081
That's $3.184.35.

1273
01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.291
That sounds fair.

1274
01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.293
-Doable.
-Yeah. Alice?

1275
01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:40.588
Thank you. Alice.

1276
01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.799
We're still gonna be short.

1277
01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:45.301
They're still gonna be short.

1278
01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:48.513
After this. we're even Frank.

1279
01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:55.895
Wait a minute.
I don't understand.

1280
01:11:55.895 --> 01:12:00.066
This is for $20.000.

1281
01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.862
Frank. it's Hanukkah.

1282
01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:14.205
Hey. aren't you
forgetting something?

1283
01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:15.581
Yeah.

1284
01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:21.504
Oh. say thank you. Frank.

1285
01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.390
Cheers me.

1286
01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:41.816
(people applauding)

1287
01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:54.537
Hey. Chad. now his is
what you call a win-loose.

1288
01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.163
Worst Christmas ever.

1289
01:12:56.789 --> 01:13:01.544

I'll never tell.

1296
01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:22.523
How long have you
been running this place?

1297
01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:25.359
Too long.

1298
01:13:28.446 --> 01:13:31.490
Move to New York. work for us.
we need a new sous chef.

1299
01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:39.540
Nothing would make me happier.
but you gotta understand.

1300
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.543
my father wants this place
to stay in the family.

1301
01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:46.505
And. look. I get it.
it's kind of in the name.

1302
01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:52.595
Well. what about your sister?
Why can't she run this place?

1303
01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:54.555
No. she's busy
with her food blog.

1304
01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:56.974
That does not sound full time.

1305
01:13:56.974 --> 01:13:58.476
and don't you have
internet here?

1306
01:13:58.476 --> 01:13:59.977
Yeah. yeah. we do.

1307
01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:01.854
Okay. where's the guy
she's in love with live?

1308
01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:03.397
You mean Ben our neig...

1309
01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:05.399
No. how do you know that?

1310
01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:07.485
How do you know that
she's in love with him?

1311
01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:09.862
So. now what?

1312
01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:14.617
I'm gonna get you drunk
and take all your money.

1313
01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:18.287
And after that.

1314
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:22.208
No idea.

1315
01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:25.086
I gave up my place in Chicago.

1316
01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:29.674
Something tells me
I'm not gonna be moving in
with Chad anytime soon.

1317
01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:35.221
Well. you know.
you could always crash with me

1318
01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:36.806
until you figure things out.

1319
01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.812
And I only have a twin bed.
it's pretty uncomfortable.

1320
01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:50.987
Why are you so good to me.

1321
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:54.198
Isn't it obvious?

1322
01:14:55.491 --> 01:15:00.454
No. I'm messy.
I'm impulsive. I'm picky.

1323
01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:03.416
I constantly buy fruit
that goes bad

1324
01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:05.543
before I get around
to eating it.

1325
01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:08.170
You refuse to drink tap water.

1326
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:12.299
You have to pet
every single dog you pass.

1327
01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:13.843
you suck at throwing rocks

1328
01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:17.722
and you take a really long time
to figure things out.

1329
01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:24.270
Exactly. who needs all this?

1330
01:15:25.646 --> 01:15:26.814
Should we do it?

1331
01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:28.441
I mean. it's the quickest way.

1332
01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:30.776
it worked for you
in Jeff Schultz at Camp Shalom.

1333
01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:34.280
Oh. yeah. okay.
you're coming to New York.

1334
01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:35.990
Just watch this.

1335
01:15:39.577 --> 01:15:42.913
All right kids. we're gonna
play a little game. stand up.

1336
01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:47.418
This is a game
my great aunt Esther.
our great on Esther taught us.

1337
01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:49.837
What's it called?

1338
01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:51.589
I'm glad you asked this
called Menorah in the Middle.

1339
01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.049
How do you play?

1340
01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:55.926
Well. with this menorah
between you.

1341
01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:59.930
and you stare deeply
into each other's eyes
until I pull it away.

1342
01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:07.980
What happens when you
remove the menorah?

1343
01:16:09.607 --> 01:16:12.860
Well. that's the best
part of all. you kiss.

1344
01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:33.798
I'm going to New York.

1345
01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.551
I'm going to New York.

1346
01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:52.525
Can I talk to you for a second?

1347
01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.068
Yes.

1348
01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:57.655
I don't know how to say this.
but I've been...

1349
01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.031
I said yes.

1350
01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:01.033
Oh. wait. but what about...

1351
01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:03.452
Don't worry. we'll be fine.

1352
01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.914
Just walk away
before he changes his mind.

1353
01:17:06.914 --> 01:17:11.836
(laughs)

1354
01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:31.188
Hey. you never told
me that Romeo joke.

1355
01:17:31.188 --> 01:17:33.607
(chuckles)

1356
01:17:33.607 --> 01:17:36.235
Actually. I didn't have one.

1357
01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:38.737
I just always thought
of you as my Juliet.

1358
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:45.327
Come on. come on. come on.
you two it's starting.
come on. move it. come on.

1359
01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.248
It's time. it's time. it's time.

1360
01:17:49.248 --> 01:17:50.916
Here we go. here we go.
here we go.

1361
01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:55.379
We've got a huge show today.
not only are we making a pastry

1362
01:17:55.379 --> 01:17:58.382
that tastes like our childhood
wrapped up in a flaky crust.

1363
01:17:58.382 --> 01:18:02.636
but we are doing it with our
very own brand new sous chef

1364
01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:04.847
who's gonna tell us about
his very personal connection

1365
01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:07.099
to this very tasty concoction.

1366
01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:11.228
Please give a big long
welcome to Jacob Becker.

1367
01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:13.731
(cheering)

1368
01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:16.942
Tell us
what we're making today. Jake.

1369
01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:19.445
Becky. we're making rugelach.

1370
01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:21.655
which is a traditional
Jewish pastry.

1371
01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:25.201
And we're using a recipe
that was created by my Zayde.

1372
01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:29.747
That's grandfather
for you Gentiles out there.

1373
01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:31.999
Zayde means grandfather.
and would it be safe to say.
Jacob.

1374
01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:35.586
that this is your Zayde's baby?
Because that's fun to say.

1375
01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:39.882
It is fun to say and it's true
because he taught my father.
my dad passed it on to me.

1376
01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:43.093
and it is an honor to share it

1377
01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:45.638
with each and every one
of you watching at home.

1378
01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:46.722
And I hope
you'll bake along with us.

1379
01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.515
and if that's too much.

1380
01:18:48.515 --> 01:18:52.686
just follow along in the
shared spirit of tradition.

1381
01:18:52.686 --> 01:18:57.691
creation of a profusely dense
pastry of family and love.

1382
01:18:57.691 --> 01:18:59.735
Jacob. I don't know
if you know this.

1383
01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:02.529
but when Becky and I were kids.
we used to walk to school.

1384
01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:08.202
And every day on the way home.
we would go to your
family's bakery

1385
01:19:08.202 --> 01:19:12.623
and your dad would give us
two piece of rugelach.

1386
01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:14.083
