00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:43.695
- All these people
here to enjoy the

4
00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:48.874
outdoors and boy. they have
no idea what just drove by.

5
00:00:53.227 --> 00:00:56.317
And we'll go right up the
top of the mountain and...

6
00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.711
spray 'em all.

7
00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:02.671
Douglas County Parks
picnic area here.

8
00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:07.502
Swift Water Park.

9
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.465
So we'll go up top
and toxify things.

10
00:01:21.907 --> 00:01:24.867
- These helicopters
flying over the ridge

11
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.306
spraying something and they
didn't even see the kids.

12
00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:33.658
The kids were all fishing or
just playing by the river.

13
00:01:35.138 --> 00:01:37.967
And the kids were all
choking and gasping.

14
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.100
That night they were
all really sick.

15
00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:44.626
They had diarrhea. they were
having trouble breathing.

16
00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:49.196
We went down to the
river that next day

17
00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:51.415
and that's when we
found dead ducklings

18
00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.984
and dead crayfish. dead trout.

19
00:01:56.507 --> 00:01:58.640
We called the Forest Service

20
00:01:58.683 --> 00:02:02.034
and they said. "Oh no.
it's perfectly safe."

21
00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:07.214
It was a mixture 2.4-D
and 2.4.5-T. Agent Orange.

22
00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:11.827
that was banned in Vietnam
and nobody realized

23
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.961
that the same chemicals
were being used here.

24
00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.792
And it's still going on.

25
00:03:15.847 --> 00:03:18.328
- Agent Orange
was a tremendously

26
00:03:18.372 --> 00:03:21.549
destructive component of a
tremendously destructive war.

27
00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:28.425
In its own unique
way. Agent Orange was

28
00:03:29.557 --> 00:03:31.167
the most destructive instance

29
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.126
of chemical warfare
in modern history.

30
00:03:51.056 --> 00:03:53.015
- You're such a
good puppy. uh-huh.

31
00:03:53.058 --> 00:03:54.408
You're gonna be a big help?

32
00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:01.893
This is our newt pond.

33
00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:04.548
If the sun comes out.
the newts will come out

34
00:04:04.592 --> 00:04:07.856
but they're all in
hiding. and in the spring

35
00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:11.251
which probably in another
month. they have orgies.

36
00:04:11.294 --> 00:04:14.906
Really. I have X-rated
pictures of my newts.

37
00:04:15.907 --> 00:04:18.910
[chickens clucking]

38
00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:22.262
When I was still five
years old or something.

39
00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:25.221
I read everything. cereal
boxes. the New York Times.

40
00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.484
I mean it just didn't matter

41
00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:30.313
and it was still during the war

42
00:04:30.357 --> 00:04:34.317
and I read something
about all the birds

43
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:38.495
being killed by oil spills
from ships being blown up

44
00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.454
and that's what I worried about

45
00:04:40.497 --> 00:04:43.370
during the War was
all those birds.

46
00:04:43.413 --> 00:04:46.416
You coming. Mike?
You gonna help me?

47
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.983
And I started writing letters.

48
00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:51.073
I'm not sure who I sent
them to or [chuckles].

49
00:04:51.116 --> 00:04:54.729
wanting someone to take
care of those birds. please!

50
00:04:57.122 --> 00:05:02.127
Maybe that was the beginning
of my activism. I have no idea.

51
00:05:06.088 --> 00:05:08.308
We moved here in '74.

52
00:05:09.657 --> 00:05:12.964
The kids were just
part of this landscape.

53
00:05:13.008 --> 00:05:14.575
They were down along the river.

54
00:05:14.618 --> 00:05:17.099
They knew everything
that lived down there.

55
00:05:18.448 --> 00:05:20.798
the dippers and
they're called dippers

56
00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:23.540
because they'll sit on
a rock and bow to you.

57
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:30.591
My kids loved it. I mean
they were part of it.

58
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.510
There were beavers and
otters in the river then too

59
00:05:36.553 --> 00:05:40.601
and of course all the fish
and the herons and ospreys.

60
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.735
So they just were part
of that. they loved it.

61
00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:47.999
There was nothing
to worry about.

62
00:05:51.438 --> 00:05:53.918
[saw buzzing]

63
00:05:55.224 --> 00:05:58.227

[truck beeping]

65
00:06:07.062 --> 00:06:08.716
[Carol] Clear-cutting
is one of the most

66
00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.631
insane things you could ever do.

67
00:06:10.674 --> 00:06:15.113
It's like strip mining a living
organism. which a forest is.

68
00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:21.119
They weren't required
to replant and most

69
00:06:21.163 --> 00:06:24.906
of those clear-cuts developed
into huge brush fields.

70
00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.083
Anything that would save the
soil was better than nothing.

71
00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:33.218
Then all of a sudden
they were faced

72
00:06:33.262 --> 00:06:35.786
with this law that says
you can't clear-cut

73
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.267
unless you replant
within three years.

74
00:06:39.964 --> 00:06:42.314
So then they had to
clear all the brush

75
00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:45.492
on these old clear-cuts so
they could replant them.

76
00:06:48.146 --> 00:06:50.279
It just all coincided

77
00:06:50.322 --> 00:06:54.936
with the end of the use of
Agent Orange in Vietnam.

78
00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:08.558
Michael Newton from
Oregon State University

79
00:07:08.602 --> 00:07:12.214
was getting surplus
barrels of Agent Orange

80
00:07:12.257 --> 00:07:16.348
that the Air Force couldn't
use anymore in Vietnam

81
00:07:16.392 --> 00:07:19.351
and was praising the
use of these things

82
00:07:19.395 --> 00:07:24.095
and how they were going to
transform forestry forever.

83
00:07:26.228 --> 00:07:29.274
And they started to
just blanket these

84
00:07:29.318 --> 00:07:32.843
huge clear-cuts with
a lot of Agent Orange.

85
00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:40.024
It drifts. and we could smell
it and within a few days.

86
00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:43.506
our garden was dead. the
kids were all sick again

87
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.813
and the dog got so sick he died.

88
00:07:49.381 --> 00:07:52.472
[ominous tones]

89
00:07:54.038 --> 00:07:56.650
One woman had had
14 miscarriages

90
00:07:58.042 --> 00:08:01.306
and hunters were
finding deformed deer.

91
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.874
baby fawns with no eyes.

92
00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:10.054
Geese were hatching with
horrendous deformities.

93
00:08:10.098 --> 00:08:13.362
They had their feet
on backwards. they
had crossed beaks.

94
00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:16.626
Some of them had only one wing

95
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.455
or a little crippled up.
you know what I mean?

96
00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:23.241
We just didn't know
until we were hearing

97
00:08:23.285 --> 00:08:25.243
the same thing from
other people and that

98
00:08:25.287 --> 00:08:27.463
it didn't happen until
the spraying happened.

99
00:08:32.207 --> 00:08:34.426
That first meeting
we had out here.

100
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.865
no one knew what they were
spraying or what it was for.

101
00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:41.042
A lot of people
just assumed. well.

102
00:08:41.085 --> 00:08:43.261
it's the government doing
it. it must be okay.

103
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.918
We invited the Forest Service

104
00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:50.312
and we were basically saying

105
00:08:50.355 --> 00:08:52.314
"This is what's happening
to us and maybe you

106
00:08:52.357 --> 00:08:55.230
don't know about it but now
you do and you need to stop."

107
00:08:57.493 --> 00:09:00.148
And of course they didn't
take us seriously at all.

108
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:10.941
We call ourselves the
document junkies. you know?

109
00:09:12.377 --> 00:09:15.119
Yeah. "no trace Of
contamination found."

110
00:09:15.163 --> 00:09:17.078
That's the lies
they got published.

111
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:21.256
- Carol has been just
a tireless champion

112
00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:25.608
for uncovering true.
factual. scientifically-based

113
00:09:25.652 --> 00:09:30.004
information and trying to get
that before decision makers.

114
00:09:30.918 --> 00:09:33.398
[protesters chanting]

115
00:09:33.442 --> 00:09:35.836
These people were just
literally at their wit's end

116
00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:38.926
and I remember sitting
there thinking Bruce.

117
00:09:38.969 --> 00:09:41.842
there's some way you've
gotta help these people.

118
00:09:41.885 --> 00:09:45.541
They are literally --
nobody's willing to help 'em.

119
00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:48.500
And I said. you've gotta
produce the experts

120
00:09:48.544 --> 00:09:50.938
and if you can produce
the experts. I'll take

121
00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:54.594
your case on and we'll
go to battle over it.

122
00:09:54.637 --> 00:09:55.725
[camera snaps]

123
00:10:03.951 --> 00:10:06.344
- It was raining a minute ago
and the sun just came out.

124
00:10:06.388 --> 00:10:09.217
So I just wanted
to document this.

125
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:10.784
I think this is why you're not

126
00:10:10.827 --> 00:10:13.395
supposed to spray at
certain temperatures

127
00:10:13.438 --> 00:10:15.179
and obviously you're
not supposed to spray

128
00:10:15.223 --> 00:10:17.660
during the rain because
it goes right down

129
00:10:17.704 --> 00:10:21.490
into the creek and over
there and over there.

130
00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:24.188
Anyways. everything's going
into the creek around here.

131
00:10:26.582 --> 00:10:29.106
These vapors. I'm
breathing 'em right now.

132
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.282
I'm in a gas chamber right now.

133
00:10:32.588 --> 00:10:34.459
These chemicals volatize.

[helicopter whirring]

135
00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:38.246
You gotta be f'ing kidding me.

136
00:10:40.944 --> 00:10:42.424
I just got sprayed again.

137

139
00:19:15.197 --> 00:19:16.981
the stage of history is set
for first meeting between

140
00:19:17.025 --> 00:19:19.332
President Eisenhower and Senator
Kennedy since the election.

141
00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:21.203
- When Eisenhower passed over

142
00:19:21.247 --> 00:19:24.685
the national security
apparatus to John Kennedy.

143
00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:28.210
how scared we had
to be that Communism

144
00:19:28.254 --> 00:19:33.215
was on the march and we had
to stop it wherever it was.

145
00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:38.177
Kennedy loved the idea
that American ingenuity.

146
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.093
not just big. scary bombs but

147
00:19:42.137 --> 00:19:46.272
different. more surgical kinds
of technologies could be used

148
00:19:46.315 --> 00:19:50.406
to defeat these insurgencies.
And Agent Orange.

149
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.411
herbicides in general. was
part of that strategic view.

150
00:19:56.325 --> 00:19:57.805

Michigan. revolutionary
chemical killers are being

153
00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:07.989
produced to help rid us
of these costly pests.

154
00:20:08.032 --> 00:20:10.600
One of the newest and most
versatile weapons in Dow's

155
00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:15.039
arsenal of chemical warfare
is 2.4-Dow weed killer.

Proved in action
against hundreds

157
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.827
of weeds and a wide
variety of crops.

158
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.570
2.4-D is a growth regulator
type of weed killer.

The action is physiological.
appearing to upset the plant's

160

growth processes and causing
gradual but certain death.

161
00:20:44.417 --> 00:20:47.855
- The Saigon government in 1961

162
00:20:47.898 --> 00:20:51.293
was a vociferous proponent

163
00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:55.036
of the use of
herbicides in Vietnam.

164
00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:00.215
The Diem government was
fighting a Communist insurgency

165
00:21:00.259 --> 00:21:04.741
in the South that was
supplied by the North.

[gunfire clacking]

167
00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.877
They felt that the insurgency

168
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.097
was a major threat
to their existence.

169
00:21:30.114 --> 00:21:30.941
- Okay.

170
00:21:32.247 --> 00:21:35.076
This is in October. 1961.

171
00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:37.296

gotten started yet.

Diem is begging people

00:21:47.044 --> 00:21:52.049
to spray crops and there's
so much doubt and confusion

175
00:21:53.747 --> 00:21:55.618
in Washington about
whether to do this or not.

176
00:22:26.562 --> 00:22:29.522
- And as long as they controlled
the defoliation program

177
00:22:29.565 --> 00:22:32.916
in a very professional way.
then there wasn't any concern

178
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.704
that the prohibitions of
the Geneva Protocol applied.

179
00:22:59.465 --> 00:23:01.510
"The President has
approved the recommendation

180
00:23:01.554 --> 00:23:03.991
of the Secretary of State
and the Deputy Secretary

181
00:23:04.034 --> 00:23:07.429
of Defense to participate
in a selective

182
00:23:07.473 --> 00:23:10.345
and carefully
controlled joint program

183
00:23:10.389 --> 00:23:13.174
of defoliant
operations in Vietnam.

184
00:23:13.217 --> 00:23:15.611
starting with the
clearance of key routes

185
00:23:15.655 --> 00:23:19.093
and proceeding thereafter
to food denial."

186
00:23:25.142 --> 00:23:27.101
- [Zierler] - Take
away the forest cover.

187
00:23:27.144 --> 00:23:29.495
take away the
insurgents' capability

188
00:23:29.538 --> 00:23:32.889
to hide and conduct
guerrilla ambush operations.

189
00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:40.331
But once the overall
war escalated. the
defoliation program

190
00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:43.987
just sort of followed rather
mindlessly right behind it.

191
00:23:47.338 --> 00:23:50.472
Spraying millions of gallons
of highly concentrated

192
00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:55.477
herbicides indiscriminately
over vast areas of forest

193
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.915
many times over is
chemical warfare.

194
00:24:00.613 --> 00:24:04.268
It was highly destructive
and it was massive.

195
00:24:05.748 --> 00:24:09.143
It was a weapon of
mass destruction.

196
00:24:23.157 --> 00:24:26.290
- Ranch Hand was
the name for the

197
00:24:26.334 --> 00:24:30.120
herbicide defoliation
program run by the Air Force.

198
00:24:31.774 --> 00:24:36.431
I was sent over to
Vietnam in May of 1971

199
00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:38.520
to do the final
historical write-up

200
00:24:38.564 --> 00:24:40.087
of the Ranch Hand program.

201
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:51.011
I had made friends with a young
Army lieutenant over there

202
00:24:51.054 --> 00:24:54.493
and he came to me one
afternoon and said.

203
00:24:54.536 --> 00:24:56.886
"We have received orders
from headquarters."

204
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.453
This was 1971.

205
00:24:59.846 --> 00:25:02.544
"We are to dump the
computer and erase it."

206
00:25:02.588 --> 00:25:06.156
Not download it and
ship to Washington.

207
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.332
"Dumped." he said.

208
00:25:08.376 --> 00:25:10.509
He said. "If you want
any of that information

209
00:25:10.552 --> 00:25:12.815
for your report. you're
gonna have to come

210
00:25:12.859 --> 00:25:15.209
with me tonight and we'll
go over to MACV Headquarters

211
00:25:15.252 --> 00:25:18.560
and I'll get you into my office
and we'll print 'em out."

212
00:25:18.604 --> 00:25:20.388
And he turned on the machine

213
00:25:20.431 --> 00:25:22.695
and we printed out
a stack like that.

214
00:25:24.174 --> 00:25:26.437
that had missions.

215
00:25:28.135 --> 00:25:30.703
sorties. how many
aircraft in every mission.

216
00:25:32.443 --> 00:25:36.839
coordinates. how many
gallons dropped. the dates.

217
00:25:36.883 --> 00:25:41.452
everything for all of
Southeast Asia including Laos.

218
00:25:43.454 --> 00:25:45.413
My report indicated that

219
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:48.851
there were some real problems

220
00:25:48.895 --> 00:25:51.550
developing from people
exposed to Agent Orange.

221
00:25:55.684 --> 00:26:00.254
I finished my report
and it was immediately

222
00:26:00.297 --> 00:26:04.432
classified SECRET and the
government kept it locked up

223
00:26:04.475 --> 00:26:08.871
for over 35 years and
denied that it even existed.

224
00:26:10.394 --> 00:26:12.266
- It was tantamount to
a cover up regardless.

225
00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:15.574
There was information that
was withheld. distortions

226
00:26:16.923 --> 00:26:18.794
that were commonplace.

227
00:26:18.838 --> 00:26:20.491
that did a real disservice

228
00:26:20.535 --> 00:26:23.756
to the veterans and
to our rule of law.

229
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.587
All of that occurred with
far greater regularity

230
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:33.592
and at far higher levels than
I would like to acknowledge.

231
00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:37.770
- [Clary] The powers that
be went to great lengths

232
00:26:37.813 --> 00:26:39.423
to play down--

233
00:26:40.903 --> 00:26:45.081
to deny--any effect
of the TCDD. dioxin.

234
00:26:45.125 --> 00:26:47.388
in the herbicide.

235
00:27:19.768 --> 00:27:22.553
- When we started
the litigation.

236
00:27:22.597 --> 00:27:24.686
this became a real
David and Goliath act

237
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:28.255
because we had the
whole U.S.Attorney's
office representing

238
00:27:28.298 --> 00:27:31.693
the Federal government
and the largest law firm

239
00:27:31.737 --> 00:27:35.131
in the state of Oregon
representing I.F.A..

240
00:27:35.175 --> 00:27:37.656
which is a front
group for the chemical

241
00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:40.528
manufacturers and
for timber sprayers.

242
00:27:45.533 --> 00:27:48.928
The Forest Service had been
unwilling to do any kind

243
00:27:48.971 --> 00:27:51.757
of community health
survey after the spraying

244
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.716
to see if anybody was
in fact being harmed.

245
00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.024
It was simply saying."Our
chemicals aren't
harming anybody."

246
00:27:58.067 --> 00:28:00.853
But it wasn't looking to
see if they were harmed.

247
00:28:00.896 --> 00:28:04.770
- My cousin. she said
she had a miscarriage

248
00:28:04.813 --> 00:28:07.511
and a friend of mine. she
did have a miscarriage.

249
00:28:07.555 --> 00:28:09.078
- [Reporter] And this was all

250
00:28:09.122 --> 00:28:09.949
in this area where
they're spraying?

251
00:28:09.992 --> 00:28:11.602
- Yeah.

252
00:28:11.646 --> 00:28:14.867
- The women have lived in areas

253
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:17.043
that have been sprayed
very close to their homes.

254
00:28:17.086 --> 00:28:19.393
Many of us have
gravity-feed water systems.

255
00:28:19.436 --> 00:28:21.221
And the dates that
they were sprayed

256
00:28:21.264 --> 00:28:23.527
are really amazing
because all of the areas

257
00:28:23.571 --> 00:28:26.139
were sprayed within a month
before the miscarriage.

258
00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:28.010
- And it was very stunning

259
00:28:29.533 --> 00:28:32.536
that they would spray an
area and within a month

260
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.801
the miscarriage
rate--what they called

261
00:28:35.844 --> 00:28:39.935
the spontaneous abortion
rate--would skyrocket.

262
00:28:41.023 --> 00:28:43.460
according to the hospital data.

263
00:28:53.427 --> 00:28:56.909
- Between my husband and I
and our nurse practitioner.

264
00:28:56.952 --> 00:29:01.696
we delivered between 100
and 150 children a year...

265
00:29:04.264 --> 00:29:06.875
seeing a larger number
of birth defects

266
00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:09.356
than we would've expected.

267
00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:12.925
We saw a number of
congenital hearts.

268
00:29:14.665 --> 00:29:19.496
And I think it was 1978. I
delivered an anencephalic child.

269
00:29:21.237 --> 00:29:24.719
That's a child that doesn't
have basically the normal brain.

270
00:29:26.199 --> 00:29:27.722
In my lifetime of
delivering babies.

271
00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:29.506
I would not expect
ever to see one.

272
00:29:30.943 --> 00:29:33.423
And about a year later.

273
00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:37.123
we delivered a second
anencephalic child.

274
00:29:37.166 --> 00:29:40.604
Those odds were
just astronomical

275
00:29:40.648 --> 00:29:42.781
that a small practice like ours

276
00:29:42.824 --> 00:29:44.739
would have two
anencephalic children.

277
00:29:46.349 --> 00:29:48.787
All of these
chemicals are suspect.

278
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.311
We know in animals that
they cause birth defects.

279
00:29:51.354 --> 00:29:53.443
Why are we using them in humans?

280
00:29:56.055 --> 00:29:58.797
It made me realize that
there was something going on

281
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:03.149
and the something
that I was aware of

282
00:30:03.192 --> 00:30:06.500
was broadcast spraying
of herbicides.

283
00:30:06.543 --> 00:30:11.548
At that point. it was mainly
2.4-D over our water supplies

284
00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:15.161
because we drink surface
water at the coast.

285
00:30:16.727 --> 00:30:19.948
[ominous tones ]

286
00:30:52.502 --> 00:30:54.461
[camera snaps]

287
00:30:57.507 --> 00:31:01.337
- Down below me is a
dam and a water supply.

288
00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:04.123
If this camera shows it.
there's the helicopter

289
00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:06.038
on the ridge right
there by the trees.

290
00:31:06.081 --> 00:31:08.692
So we're gonna be
spraying right below it.

291
00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:10.607
Crazy!

292
00:31:10.651 --> 00:31:13.915
That whole unit over there
is dead. dead. dead. dead

293
00:31:13.959 --> 00:31:15.264
and they're spraying
more chemicals on it

294
00:31:15.308 --> 00:31:17.266
right now as we speak.

295
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.225
I gotta hold this low because

296
00:31:19.268 --> 00:31:21.531
right over there is the
honcho of the forest.

297
00:31:23.272 --> 00:31:26.188
So basically we
dropped 1160 gallons

298
00:31:27.494 --> 00:31:29.061
into this right here

299
00:31:30.584 --> 00:31:32.455
and it is. I'm gonna
show you real quick.

300
00:31:34.153 --> 00:31:39.114
it's gonna go basically right
down into that watershed

301
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.901
and the unit's already
de-weeded anyways.

302
00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:44.554
I don't know why they did that.

303
00:31:45.642 --> 00:31:46.774
And here's the reservoir.

304
00:31:46.817 --> 00:31:48.123
I'm down here at the reservoir.

305
00:31:50.343 --> 00:31:52.214
And we're gonna go spray

306
00:31:53.694 --> 00:31:55.000
on the other side of
the reservoir now.

307
00:31:55.043 --> 00:31:56.610
Both sides of the watershed.

308
00:31:59.613 --> 00:32:02.268
[Darryl coughs]

309
00:32:03.312 --> 00:32:05.271
My throat is burning.

310
00:32:16.891 --> 00:32:20.721
- The kids were involved in
the whole herbicide battle.

311
00:32:23.028 --> 00:32:25.160
They were helping
write the newsletters

312
00:32:25.204 --> 00:32:28.207
and draw the pictures
and help with signs.

313
00:32:31.471 --> 00:32:34.648
There's the poster
that Daphne made.

314
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:36.606
She did that when
she was about 11.

315
00:32:39.174 --> 00:32:41.872
They were right in
the thick of it.

316
00:32:45.833 --> 00:32:48.096
We had like five minutes
to come up with a name

317
00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:53.145
for this group: Citizens
Against Toxic Sprays. CATS.

318
00:32:54.973 --> 00:32:58.237
It wasn't the most imaginative
name but it worked. I guess.

319
00:32:59.238 --> 00:33:01.022
Hi.
- Hi. Carol.

320
00:33:01.066 --> 00:33:04.765
- And it wasn't until
basically CATS was formed

321
00:33:04.808 --> 00:33:09.117
and started questioning it
with filing a court action

322
00:33:09.161 --> 00:33:12.860
and then it suddenly
got some attention and

323
00:33:13.948 --> 00:33:15.776
there was a lot of pushback

324
00:33:15.819 --> 00:33:20.346
from the chemical companies
and the timber companies.

325
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:22.783
- Chemicals are
being used as a means

326
00:33:22.826 --> 00:33:26.482
of achieving environmental
goals. really.

327
00:33:28.876 --> 00:33:32.880
The attack is not scientific.
it's purely emotional.

328
00:33:32.923 --> 00:33:37.058
The public does not understand
and we unfortunately

329
00:33:37.102 --> 00:33:40.757
haven't successfully
communicated to
the public as yet.

330
00:33:40.801 --> 00:33:43.804
Take 2.4.5-T for example.

331
00:33:43.847 --> 00:33:46.589
2.4.5-T is about as
toxic as aspirin.

332
00:33:49.636 --> 00:33:52.378
The safety factor in
the use of 2.4.5-T

333
00:33:52.421 --> 00:33:56.077
is far greater than the safety
factors in use of aspirin.

334
00:33:56.121 --> 00:33:58.036
Now does the public
understand that?

335
00:34:06.653 --> 00:34:08.394
- [Carol] Documents disappearing

336
00:34:08.437 --> 00:34:11.179
is a common thing I think
in this whole story.

337
00:34:14.748 --> 00:34:16.532
Susan Swift's health study

338
00:34:16.576 --> 00:34:19.405
that she was doing of
everybody in this valley...

339
00:34:22.147 --> 00:34:25.106
she had done door-to-door survey

340
00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:28.414
of peoples' health and the
children's health and animals.

341
00:34:28.457 --> 00:34:31.156
anything that people
could report about

342
00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:35.986
and her house getting broken
into and this health study.

343
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.686
all the data she had
collected. it was gone.

344
00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:45.431
- I was just taking information

345
00:34:45.474 --> 00:34:46.954
and gathered the data together

346
00:34:46.997 --> 00:34:50.218
and I created a
questionnaire to go

347
00:34:50.262 --> 00:34:54.048
and I interviewed every home
up and down Five Rivers Road.

348
00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:55.571
There was an enormous amount

349
00:34:55.615 --> 00:34:59.532
of small tumors
and miscarriages.

350
00:34:59.575 --> 00:35:02.752
Right after that. my box of

351
00:35:02.796 --> 00:35:05.538
documented forms
disappeared out of my house.

352
00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:10.934
The board members of
Citizens Against Toxic Sprays

353
00:35:10.978 --> 00:35:13.372
were going to Eugene
over the mountain

354
00:35:13.415 --> 00:35:15.113
taking these Forest
Service roads.

355
00:35:15.156 --> 00:35:17.332
just going straight up
and over the mountain.

356
00:35:17.376 --> 00:35:19.856
all gravel little logging roads.

357
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:24.426
and we were being
followed by a shiny sedan

358
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.385
with guys in suits.

359
00:35:26.428 --> 00:35:28.822
And that was pretty bizarre.

360
00:35:28.865 --> 00:35:32.521
[low. ominous tones]

361
00:35:35.785 --> 00:35:38.048
- One Saturday morning
when my husband

362
00:35:38.092 --> 00:35:41.008
was making rounds
at the hospital.

363
00:35:41.051 --> 00:35:44.838
two fellows in suits
showed up at my front door

364
00:35:46.622 --> 00:35:50.017
and said they wanted to
talk about the herbicides.

365
00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:52.150
And I said that was fine.

366
00:35:52.193 --> 00:35:54.152
My two children
were running around

367
00:35:54.195 --> 00:35:55.675
very happily playing.

368
00:35:57.198 --> 00:35:58.721
They didn't really say
where they were from.

369
00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:02.551
I said. "Come on in.
have a cup of coffee."

370
00:36:02.595 --> 00:36:05.293
Because I had had a
number of reporters

371
00:36:05.337 --> 00:36:09.950
and other people show up.
And then when they said.

372
00:36:09.993 --> 00:36:13.345
"Do you know at all times
where your children are?"

373
00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:17.697
I realized that I didn't.

374
00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:23.093
And I said it was time
to end the interview

375
00:36:23.137 --> 00:36:27.359
because it was clearly a threat
against me and my children.

376
00:36:32.668 --> 00:36:34.888
And it worked. I'm done.

377
00:36:36.672 --> 00:36:40.720
- [Bruce] A van that had dark
tinted windows on both sides

378
00:36:40.763 --> 00:36:44.245
suddenly showed up outside
of Carol and Steve's house.

379
00:36:44.289 --> 00:36:45.768
who were the leaders of

380
00:36:45.812 --> 00:36:48.423
the Citizens Against
Toxic Spray movement.

381
00:36:48.467 --> 00:36:49.946
- This is for Sadie.

382
00:36:51.818 --> 00:36:54.516
The car was parked here but
they were walking up here

383
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.868
with all their gear. obviously
thinking I wasn't home.

384
00:37:00.305 --> 00:37:02.481
He didn't really explain
why they were here.

385
00:37:02.524 --> 00:37:04.613
It was when I
realized the other guy

386
00:37:04.657 --> 00:37:07.312
was sneaking up there
and talking to the kids.

387
00:37:07.355 --> 00:37:08.748
then I got kind of angry.

388
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.491
He was asking them
all about what kinds

389
00:37:12.534 --> 00:37:17.539
of deformed critters we had in
the freezer--because we did!

390
00:37:19.019 --> 00:37:20.586
We saved a bunch of
them hoping to get 'em

391
00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:23.284
analyzed to see what was in 'em.

392
00:37:23.328 --> 00:37:26.244
- But the rear door flew open
as it drove away and they

393
00:37:26.287 --> 00:37:29.595
could see that there were
large video cameras in there.

394
00:37:31.336 --> 00:37:33.120
- [Carol] The phone company
itself. their employees

395
00:37:33.163 --> 00:37:36.210
told us that our phones
were being tapped.

396
00:37:38.691 --> 00:37:40.432
Steve would get in the car

397
00:37:40.475 --> 00:37:42.390
and he would usually
drive over the back roads.

398
00:37:42.434 --> 00:37:45.393
Nobody drives over
there. nobody did then.

399
00:37:46.873 --> 00:37:48.440
Suddenly. there'd
be a car behind him

400
00:37:48.483 --> 00:37:51.486
and it would stick
to him all the way

401
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:56.012
every time they went to
the valley to do anything.

402
00:37:56.056 --> 00:37:57.753
Who is it? We don't know.

403
00:37:57.797 --> 00:38:01.322
Is it government people?
Is it industry people?

404
00:38:01.366 --> 00:38:03.846
There was no way to really know.

405
00:38:05.674 --> 00:38:07.459
- [Bruce] It was an obvious
attempt to try to intimidate

406
00:38:07.502 --> 00:38:10.984
the folks who were
bringing this litigation

407
00:38:11.027 --> 00:38:13.987
to try to reduce
herbicide aerial spraying.

408
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:24.476
- Well. we won a
temporary injunction.

409
00:38:28.654 --> 00:38:30.699
What the Judge in the CATS case.

410
00:38:30.743 --> 00:38:33.398
thanks to all those
scientists and studies

411
00:38:33.441 --> 00:38:37.619
that we were able to
compile. ruled was that hey.

412
00:38:37.663 --> 00:38:41.623
you've got to include in
your environmental impact

413
00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:45.410
statement the effects of
these chemicals in Vietnam.

414
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:51.198
And that was a blow to the
Forest Service because by then.

415
00:38:51.241 --> 00:38:56.246
there were some really
documented impacts in Vietnam.

416
00:39:03.558 --> 00:39:05.778
We felt vindicated
in a lot of ways

417
00:39:05.821 --> 00:39:10.217
but his injunction only
applied to 2.4.5-T.

418
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.088
which was half of Agent Orange.

419
00:39:20.749 --> 00:39:24.144
The CATS case generated
quite a bit of publicity

420
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:29.715
just because it was so amazing
that these people living

421
00:39:29.758 --> 00:39:33.240
out in the woods could sue the
Federal government and win.

422
00:39:33.283 --> 00:39:36.896
It was kind of unheard
of at that point.

423
00:39:36.939 --> 00:39:38.985
especially on an
environmental issue.

424
00:39:40.769 --> 00:39:44.164
So other people
were contacting us.

425
00:39:44.207 --> 00:39:47.254
They were all experiencing
the same thing.

426
00:39:47.297 --> 00:39:51.258
This was people in other
places in Oregon. in

427
00:39:51.301 --> 00:39:55.915
the state of Washington. in
Idaho. in Northern California.

428
00:39:55.958 --> 00:39:59.484
There were even requests
from places back east.

429
00:40:01.311 --> 00:40:03.096
- [Susan] One thing I'll
never forget is that just

430
00:40:03.139 --> 00:40:06.795
gathering scientific data
from Oregon State University.

431
00:40:06.839 --> 00:40:09.885
what we were able to find
from their own library.

432
00:40:09.929 --> 00:40:13.280
studies in Idaho of
roadside spray workers

433
00:40:13.323 --> 00:40:17.806
that showed deformed sperm
after the spray season.

434
00:40:19.286 --> 00:40:22.637
- So we put together
an information packet

435
00:40:22.681 --> 00:40:25.161
and then they could use
that information to take

436
00:40:25.205 --> 00:40:29.557
their own actions and file
their own cases. whatever.

437
00:40:36.825 --> 00:40:40.089
[ominous music]

438
00:40:43.136 --> 00:40:46.052
There were negative feelings
toward what we were doing.

439
00:40:46.095 --> 00:40:47.706
The propaganda put out by

440
00:40:47.749 --> 00:40:50.143
the chemical companies
and the timber companies

441
00:40:50.186 --> 00:40:53.189
that number one. there's
nothing wrong with the sprays

442
00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:57.280
and number two. these people
are just the lunatic fringe.

443
00:40:59.848 --> 00:41:01.589
They convinced the
loggers or some

444
00:41:01.633 --> 00:41:03.504
of them anyway that
they were gonna all

445
00:41:03.548 --> 00:41:07.377
be out of work if they
couldn't use the herbicides.

446
00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:21.827
- The house was on fire when
Carol came up the driveway.

447
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:23.481
The house was totally in flames.

448
00:41:24.873 --> 00:41:26.440
Patrick said he stopped her.

449
00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:28.268
that she grabbed a knife
off his belt and started

450
00:41:28.311 --> 00:41:31.793
running up the hill and he
just grabbed her and held her.

451
00:41:33.229 --> 00:41:36.232
And he felt sure
that Carol was gonna

452
00:41:36.276 --> 00:41:38.887
try to take her own
life that night.

453
00:41:43.718 --> 00:41:46.504
The Van Strum
children were gone...

454
00:41:52.684 --> 00:41:55.077
And we all crumbled. we all
just couldn't believe it.

455
00:42:00.909 --> 00:42:03.521
- The firefighters
said it was arson.

456
00:42:16.621 --> 00:42:20.276
It's hard to talk about
it. I just can't really.

457
00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.602
They had done the absolute
worst thing anybody

458
00:42:41.646 --> 00:42:46.346
could do to me and they
couldn't do anymore.

459
00:42:50.263 --> 00:42:52.570
Okay everybody. who's hungry?

460
00:42:53.658 --> 00:42:55.268
Yes. you want some brekker.

461
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:56.965
The animals were still here.

462
00:42:57.009 --> 00:43:00.012
I think that's what
kept me going. you know?

463
00:43:00.055 --> 00:43:02.057
It was what was left of my kids

464
00:43:02.101 --> 00:43:04.582
was what they loved. you know?

465
00:43:05.583 --> 00:43:07.759
Oh boy. here you go.

466
00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:11.589
Oakey's the big
one. 30 years old.

467
00:43:11.632 --> 00:43:13.155
He's very intuitive.

468
00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.943
Like if you're really upset
about something. he will come

469
00:43:17.986 --> 00:43:22.469
and just like lean against
you and be comforting.

470
00:43:23.557 --> 00:43:24.732
Hey. Rudy-tooty.

471
00:43:26.516 --> 00:43:30.825
He wants to help you feel
better. I don't know.

472
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.785
I rely on him.

473
00:43:35.874 --> 00:43:37.571
[Carol laughs]

474
00:43:39.573 --> 00:43:43.142
This was the garage.
there was no floor here.

475
00:43:43.185 --> 00:43:46.667
And so we put a floor
in and I just was living

476
00:43:48.016 --> 00:43:50.236
in this room and I still am.

477
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.158
In a way. it was in honor of
my kids I had to keep going.

478
00:43:59.201 --> 00:44:03.031
They fought this fight
too. it wasn't just me.

479
00:44:03.075 --> 00:44:07.427
And the only thing was to
keep going for their sake.

480
00:47:31.587 --> 00:47:35.330
- The Federal government
basically federalized

481
00:47:35.374 --> 00:47:38.072
all the chemical companies
to do nothing but produce

482
00:47:39.769 --> 00:47:41.859
Agent Orange and other chemicals
for the war in Vietnam.

483
00:47:43.338 --> 00:47:44.905
And they knew that the
more they produced.

484
00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:46.037
the more money they would make.

485
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.126
So they. in order to

486
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:52.130
deliver as much as they could
as quickly as they could.

487
00:47:52.173 --> 00:47:55.568
they violated then
existing industry standards

488
00:47:55.611 --> 00:47:57.744
for the production of herbicides

489
00:47:57.787 --> 00:48:01.487
by using a process
that was much shorter.

490
00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.358
at higher temperatures.

491
00:48:03.402 --> 00:48:07.362
that was responsible for
the presence of the dioxin

492
00:48:07.406 --> 00:48:12.411
in the ultimate chemical
substances that were created.

493
00:48:14.108 --> 00:48:15.588
And they knew that it posed
a risk to individuals.

494
00:48:15.631 --> 00:48:17.764
They knew that it posed
a risk to the land.

495
00:48:17.807 --> 00:48:19.897
They knew that it
contained a poison

496
00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:25.337
and they knew that the
effects could be devastating.

497
00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:36.478
- While I was
preparing my report.

498
00:48:36.522 --> 00:48:40.047
I came across a letter that
I got out of headquarters

499
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:44.486
that was from Dow to the
government and back and said.

500
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.445
"We cannot produce
the quantities

501
00:48:46.488 --> 00:48:51.493
of Agent Orange you want
and maintain the low level.

502
00:48:52.973 --> 00:48:55.628
insignificant level.
of TCDD. dioxin."

503
00:48:57.064 --> 00:48:58.631
And they went back and said.

504
00:48:58.674 --> 00:49:01.025
"Don't worry about it.
we need the quantities.

505
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:05.551
Besides. it's gonna be sprayed
on the jungle over there.

506
00:49:05.594 --> 00:49:07.857
There aren't gonna
be any people there.

507
00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:09.729
And if they happen to
get into it. so what?

508
00:49:09.772 --> 00:49:10.643
We're at war."

509
00:49:12.079 --> 00:49:14.125
- In a letter from
Dr. James Clary.

510
00:49:14.168 --> 00:49:16.910
an Air Force scientist. saying
that he and others involved

511
00:49:16.954 --> 00:49:20.392
in Ranch Hand knew that
Agent Orange was harmful.

512
00:49:27.138 --> 00:49:29.140
- We knew dioxin

513
00:49:30.576 --> 00:49:33.535
is an extremely
potent carcinogenic.

514
00:49:35.233 --> 00:49:37.713
mutagenic. meaning it causes
chromosomes to mutate.

515
00:49:39.193 --> 00:49:42.066
teratogenic. affecting
the fetus of a woman.

516
00:49:43.023 --> 00:49:44.198
Very potent compound.

517
00:49:48.942 --> 00:49:50.726
- National Bureau of Standards

518
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:53.991
estimate on the half-life
for a dioxin molecule:

519
00:49:55.035 --> 00:49:56.167
two billion years.

520
00:49:57.995 --> 00:50:01.346
That's why EPA regards it
as equivalent to plutonium.

521
00:50:02.825 --> 00:50:06.090
both in its toxicity
and in its longevity.

522
00:50:06.133 --> 00:50:08.005
how long it can persist.

523
00:50:09.745 --> 00:50:13.097
So it doesn't go away.
it goes away politically.

524
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:17.579
- This is the first time
that the scientists have

525
00:50:17.623 --> 00:50:21.714
ever created a molecule
this toxic and that they

526
00:50:21.757 --> 00:50:26.762
know that even just one
to two parts per trillion

527
00:50:28.112 --> 00:50:30.070
can cause birth defects.
mutations. cancer.

528
00:50:30.114 --> 00:50:33.987
- We sprayed 20 million gallons
of that stuff over there.

529
00:50:35.423 --> 00:50:37.077
Their watersheds
are contaminated.

530
00:50:37.121 --> 00:50:38.818
Their rice fields
are contaminated.

531
00:50:38.861 --> 00:50:40.515
Their wells are contaminated.

532
00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:43.431
Depending on who
you want to believe.

533
00:50:43.475 --> 00:50:46.043
there's four or 500.000 adults

534
00:50:46.086 --> 00:50:48.523
contaminated with it and
half a million children.

535
00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:54.747
[somber tone]

536
00:52:41.984 --> 00:52:45.205
[helicopters whirring]

537
00:52:52.256 --> 00:52:56.042
- The Forest Service never
did spray 2.4.5-T again.

538
00:52:56.085 --> 00:52:59.524
They substituted 2.4-D
on the assumption

539
00:52:59.567 --> 00:53:02.353
that it had no dioxin in it

540
00:53:03.441 --> 00:53:04.920
and that it was safe

541
00:53:07.619 --> 00:53:11.318
and Melyse's water
supply got sprayed.

542
00:53:14.974 --> 00:53:17.194
- [Reporter] Melyse Connelly
was one of the Five Rivers

543
00:53:17.237 --> 00:53:18.891
women who pleaded
with the government

544
00:53:18.934 --> 00:53:21.110
to come and test
their environment.

545
00:53:21.154 --> 00:53:22.721
She remembers that the EPA

546
00:53:22.764 --> 00:53:25.245
sent two scientists
from Colorado.

547
00:53:25.289 --> 00:53:26.899
They took some samples and left.

548
00:53:26.942 --> 00:53:29.467
promising to return in 90 days.

549
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:31.033
In the meantime. they wanted

550
00:53:31.077 --> 00:53:33.122
Melyse to come up
with more material.

551
00:53:33.166 --> 00:53:34.950
That included a backyard chicken

552
00:53:34.994 --> 00:53:37.518
which she still has in
her freezer and a number

553
00:53:37.562 --> 00:53:41.043
of water samples taken
with special EPA filters.

554
00:53:41.087 --> 00:53:42.741
- We called him. we wrote him.

555
00:53:42.784 --> 00:53:44.395
We wondered where he was.

556
00:53:44.438 --> 00:53:46.223
90 days is what he gave us.

557
00:53:46.266 --> 00:53:48.486
that he would be back
in touch with us.

558
00:53:48.529 --> 00:53:50.009
That was in '79.

559
00:53:50.052 --> 00:53:51.880
'83. here we are.

560
00:53:51.924 --> 00:53:54.274
- Are you angry?
- I'm very angry.

561
00:53:54.318 --> 00:53:55.623
I'm very upset.

562
00:53:57.625 --> 00:54:02.587
- There were samples taken
of people in the area.

563
00:54:03.979 --> 00:54:06.330
of tissue and
blood and I believe

564
00:54:06.373 --> 00:54:09.985
urine as well and
submitted for testing.

565
00:54:10.029 --> 00:54:13.075
Somehow. they disappeared.

566
00:54:13.119 --> 00:54:16.296
How can you have something
like that disappear?

567
00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:19.995
- Well it's both a bureaucratic
bollix and suppression.

568
00:54:20.039 --> 00:54:22.302
- [reporter] Paul Merrell
and Carol Van Strum

569
00:54:22.346 --> 00:54:24.957
have been battling
with the EPA for years.

570
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.351
They're also responsible
for uncovering many

571
00:54:27.394 --> 00:54:29.570
of the EPA documents that
have now come to light.

572
00:54:29.614 --> 00:54:34.575
- The EPA planned ahead of
time with the Forest Service

573
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:40.015
to come in after they sprayed
and collect the body count.

574
00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:41.495
- [reporter] You're
saying the people

575
00:54:41.539 --> 00:54:42.931
out there were used
as guinea pigs?

576
00:54:42.975 --> 00:54:44.193
- That's right.
- How do you know that?

577
00:54:44.237 --> 00:54:45.978
- From their own documents.

578
00:54:46.021 --> 00:54:48.633
- I'm not sure what's
gonna happen now but

579
00:54:49.895 --> 00:54:52.376
somebody's gonna pay.

580
00:55:01.602 --> 00:55:03.343
- [reporter] Dr. Mike
Newton of Oregon State

581
00:55:03.387 --> 00:55:05.345
says that a recent
study of herbicide

582
00:55:05.389 --> 00:55:08.174
applicators showed no
signs of health hazards.

583
00:55:28.499 --> 00:55:30.022
- They've got to start listening

584
00:55:30.065 --> 00:55:35.070
to some of the residents
and our rights.

585
00:55:36.855 --> 00:55:39.771
I mean I have to move because
my daughter became very ill

586
00:55:39.814 --> 00:55:43.252
just a year ago
with a blood disease

587
00:55:43.296 --> 00:55:47.474
that has been associated
with herbicides.

588
00:55:50.477 --> 00:55:52.479
I feel like I'm just

589
00:55:54.655 --> 00:55:57.049
up against the wall. you know?

590
00:55:57.092 --> 00:56:01.880
And that I've done all
that I can do peaceably.

591
00:56:01.923 --> 00:56:06.363
- This is sort of a cause
of life and death in a way.

592
00:56:25.469 --> 00:56:27.558
- Working within the
system has been done.

593
00:56:27.601 --> 00:56:30.169
The appeals have been done.
lawsuits have been done.

594
00:56:30.212 --> 00:56:32.389
Public hearings.
conferences with officials

595
00:56:32.432 --> 00:56:34.695
have been done and still
the spraying goes on.

596
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:39.570
- This person has been
contaminated. They spray people!

597
00:56:48.492 --> 00:56:50.058
- [Carol] There've
been incidents

598
00:56:50.102 --> 00:56:51.930
in other parts of
the country where

599
00:56:51.973 --> 00:56:53.845
people have actually shot
at the spray helicopter.

600
00:57:00.721 --> 00:57:03.594
- [Masked Woman] A helicopter
was burned as a message

601
00:57:03.637 --> 00:57:08.076
to the companies who profit
from spraying poisons.

602
00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.690
We sabotage
poison-spreading machines

603
00:57:12.733 --> 00:57:15.910
as an act of self-defense.

604
00:57:15.954 --> 00:57:18.435
- [Carol] No one was hurt.

605
00:57:18.478 --> 00:57:21.612
It was the frustration.
even with the CATS case.

606
00:57:21.655 --> 00:57:24.528
that they could still
go ahead and spray 2.4-D

607
00:57:24.571 --> 00:57:26.704
and at that point they
were adding. since they

608
00:57:26.747 --> 00:57:29.663
couldn't use 2.4.5-T.
they added glyphosate

609
00:57:29.707 --> 00:57:31.709
and atrazine and-
- Tordon.

610
00:57:31.752 --> 00:57:34.189
- Tordon.
- All these chemical

611
00:57:34.233 --> 00:57:36.801
cocktails that no one
has ever put together

612
00:57:36.844 --> 00:57:38.933
and tested on any
living creature.

613
00:57:38.977 --> 00:57:42.720
- And so they could continue
spraying is the point.

614
00:57:42.763 --> 00:57:44.591
- [Masked Woman]
Our present health

615
00:57:44.635 --> 00:57:48.900
and genetic future are at
stake. We will strike again.

616
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:16.656
- Newly released court
documents indicate

617
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.093
that the companies which
manufactured Agent Orange

618
01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:23.054
knew as far back as the 1960s
that one of its ingredients

619
01:00:23.097 --> 01:00:27.711
known as 2.4.5-T contained
the toxic contaminant dioxin.

620
01:00:30.931 --> 01:00:35.153
- It just blew my
mind to see documents.

621
01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:39.157
internal memos from chemical
companies. that would say

622
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.248
"We know this is toxic.
we're gonna sell it anyway."

623
01:00:50.037 --> 01:00:53.998
- Dow realized that
they needed to settle

624
01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:57.828
the Agent Orange case to keep
all that information buried.

625
01:01:00.613 --> 01:01:04.182
In the fall of 1983.

626
01:01:04.225 --> 01:01:08.012
Dow as the leader
of all the 2.4.5-T

627
01:01:08.055 --> 01:01:12.930
manufacturers withdrew all
registrations for 2.4.5-T.

628
01:01:16.498 --> 01:01:19.676
And what that did
was bury everything:

629
01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:23.854
all that evidence of dioxin

630
01:01:25.333 --> 01:01:27.596
in the environment.
in human tissues.

631
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.424
in the Vietnam veterans.

632
01:01:30.774 --> 01:01:32.645
Very. very damaging
information on

633
01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:36.083
the health effects
of 2.4.5-T and dioxin

634
01:01:36.127 --> 01:01:39.783
just was swept under the
rug. went into EPA archives

635
01:01:39.826 --> 01:01:43.308
and it's now gone forever
except what I managed to save.

636
01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:48.661
So that record would
have been dynamite

637
01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:53.274
for the veterans if
that case had continued.

638
01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:55.146
but it didn't.

639
01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:58.149
- The case was not settled
on any scientific basis.

640
01:01:58.192 --> 01:02:00.717
It was settled on
a political basis.

641
01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:04.851
The defendants wished

642
01:02:06.026 --> 01:02:08.289
to avoid further litigation.

643
01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:10.988
The moment it was settled.
their stock went up.

644
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:13.468
So they made a wise decision.

645
01:02:29.702 --> 01:02:32.487
- I think this is
good for the veterans.

646
01:02:32.531 --> 01:02:35.273
I think it's good
for the defendants.

647
01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:37.144
I think it's good
for the country

648
01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:40.931
because I think it allows
us all now to put this issue

649
01:02:40.974 --> 01:02:44.543
behind us and get on with
the business we have to do.

650
01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:56.773
- My mother had two
miscarriages when my father

651
01:02:56.816 --> 01:03:00.428
came back from Vietnam and
then I was born in '72.

652
01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:04.737
I only weighed three
pounds and four ounces.

653
01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.173
My father said he could hold me

654
01:03:06.217 --> 01:03:08.959
in his hand like
this. I was so small.

655
01:03:09.002 --> 01:03:12.745
I'm missing my right
leg below the knee.

656
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.400
my fingers and I'm
missing my big toe

657
01:03:15.443 --> 01:03:18.751
and my other toes
are webbed but. yeah.

658
01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:23.451
My story is not very much
unlike many. many children

659
01:03:23.495 --> 01:03:27.455
in Vietnam and other
American children as well.

660
01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:31.808
So we share the same
type of birth defects.

661
01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:42.122
- No. I don't get any
benefits from the government.

662
01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:44.646
They deny that the children

663
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:46.910
of male Vietnam veterans

664
01:03:49.738 --> 01:03:50.783
are affected.

665
01:03:54.613 --> 01:03:58.008
My father's own
illness. he died of.

666
01:04:00.271 --> 01:04:04.188
So I'm hoping with your lawsuit.
that things will change.

667
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:06.799
That it'll stick this time

668
01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:09.715
and many people
will understand how

669
01:04:09.758 --> 01:04:13.762
the chemical companies
have destroyed many people.

670
01:04:18.985 --> 01:04:20.987
- I was getting so angry

671
01:04:24.512 --> 01:04:26.036
that my own government

672
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.998
didn't want to provide help to
veterans who were suffering.

673
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.832
- We had a sense of moral
outrage about what happened

674
01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.400
and the fact that we
felt as lawyers. we had

675
01:04:42.443 --> 01:04:46.839
the opportunity and
the obligation to
raise these issues.

676
01:04:55.804 --> 01:04:58.329
[gavel bangs]

677
01:05:02.115 --> 01:05:03.638
And the case died.

678
01:05:05.205 --> 01:05:06.076
It's frustrating.

679
01:05:26.183 --> 01:05:30.491
- Was any assurance
given when you arrived at

680
01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:35.496
the settlement with the chemical
companies and the veterans

681
01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:37.716
that there would not be

682
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.893
any more litigation?

683
01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:43.548
Would such an assurance have

684
01:05:44.462 --> 01:05:47.334
affected your role

685
01:05:47.378 --> 01:05:50.642
when the Vietnamese
people's case came to you?

686
01:05:52.296 --> 01:05:56.691
- I'm not prepared to
discuss the Vietnamese issue.

687
01:05:58.563 --> 01:06:01.174
It was a separate case.

688
01:06:01.218 --> 01:06:05.004
decided long after the
major settlement was

689
01:06:06.484 --> 01:06:10.096
decided upon. accepted
and fully executed.

690
01:06:11.532 --> 01:06:13.926
- [Alan] So then no
such assurance was given

691
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:17.408
to the chemical companies
in the original case?

692
01:06:17.451 --> 01:06:19.453
- The original case gave

693
01:06:21.499 --> 01:06:25.329
the producers what
they settled for.

694
01:06:27.331 --> 01:06:29.202
- [Alan] And was there finality.

695
01:06:29.246 --> 01:06:31.596
an assurance of
finality to that?

696
01:06:31.639 --> 01:06:33.337
- I thought there was.

697
01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:35.121
- These companies have been able

698
01:06:35.165 --> 01:06:38.298
to avoid accountability
for what they've done.

699
01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:43.042
I think your case is
incredibly important as sort of

700
01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:47.699
the last opportunity that
we may have to hold these

701
01:06:47.742 --> 01:06:51.833
companies accountable for
the wrongdoing that they knew

702
01:06:51.877 --> 01:06:55.794
they were engaged in when they
made this poisonous product.

703
01:09:01.311 --> 01:09:03.791
- The National Forest
here is no longer sprayed

704
01:09:03.835 --> 01:09:06.794
and the reason is a
series of lawsuits

705
01:09:06.838 --> 01:09:09.493
that began with
the CATS lawsuit.

706
01:09:09.536 --> 01:09:12.191
But how about all
those other people?

707
01:09:12.235 --> 01:09:14.411
How about people right
down the road that have

708
01:09:14.454 --> 01:09:18.937
private timberland around
them that's getting sprayed?

709
01:10:25.482 --> 01:10:27.440
- Here he comes. I
gotta reload him.

710
01:10:31.618 --> 01:10:33.664
All these chemicals
are going in there.

711
01:10:33.707 --> 01:10:35.231
All this goes into that truck.

712
01:10:38.799 --> 01:10:40.236
This stuff is nasty stuff.

713
01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:44.370
It's a nasty combo and
it kills everything.

714
01:10:44.414 --> 01:10:46.285
It kills everything including

715
01:10:46.329 --> 01:10:47.982
my ability to breathe correctly.

716
01:10:51.421 --> 01:10:52.987
[camera snaps]

717
01:10:55.642 --> 01:10:58.166
Hold on. it says on the label:

718
01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:01.126
"hazardous to humans
and domestic animals."

719
01:11:02.867 --> 01:11:05.783
And it leaks out
onto everywhere.

720
01:11:08.829 --> 01:11:12.572
There's just so many things
not right about this.

721
01:11:14.095 --> 01:11:15.314
- [Carol] They're gonna
keep these chemicals

722
01:11:15.358 --> 01:11:17.664
on the market no matter what.

723
01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:21.842
The only hope is for
the community rights

724
01:11:21.886 --> 01:11:25.324
movement to keep insisting
that we have the right

725
01:11:25.368 --> 01:11:30.242
to protect all of our
communities from being poisoned.

726
01:11:32.026 --> 01:11:34.594
And maybe it's a pipe dream
but if these corporations

727
01:11:34.638 --> 01:11:37.641
have human rights according
to the Supreme Court.

728
01:11:37.684 --> 01:11:39.817
well damn it. they
should be subject

729
01:11:39.860 --> 01:11:43.386
to capital punishment just
like an individual would be.

730
01:11:43.429 --> 01:11:45.301
[people applauding]

731
01:12:15.548 --> 01:12:18.551
[people applauding]

732
01:14:01.045 --> 01:14:03.264
- It's been hard work
coming for us but-

733
01:14:03.308 --> 01:14:04.831
- A lot of hard work but I want

734
01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:07.268
to emphasize how
important the work is.

735
01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:11.447
Even though you feel sometimes
you're working in isolation.

736
01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:13.057
there's a lot of
people watching this.

737
01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:18.889
- [Amelie] She was diagnosed
with cancer this week.

738
01:14:54.446 --> 01:14:57.275
[thunder booming]

739
01:17:12.497 --> 01:17:15.892
- [Carol] Documents
accumulated over 40 years

740
01:17:15.935 --> 01:17:19.373
of Freedom of Information
Actions that I did.

741
01:17:19.417 --> 01:17:21.158
including several lawsuits

742
01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:23.639
to try to get
documents out of EPA.

743
01:17:25.031 --> 01:17:28.339
PCB lawsuits. the
Agent Orange lawsuits

744
01:17:28.382 --> 01:17:31.516
trying to stop the
government spraying out here.

745
01:17:35.215 --> 01:17:37.000
Then I had a bunch of stuff

746
01:17:37.043 --> 01:17:39.306
from Dow Chemical that
they hoped I'd never get.

747
01:17:41.569 --> 01:17:43.876
I couldn't afford to
store them anywhere

748
01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.052
and that's when Peter
von Stackelberg.

749
01:17:46.096 --> 01:17:50.187
the Canadian journalist. drummed
up some funding to get them

750
01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:53.843
all scanned and that was how
the Poison Papers happened.

751
01:17:57.107 --> 01:18:00.240
We must have scanned
close to 200.000 pages.

752
01:18:02.155 --> 01:18:04.723
He could upload them
as they were scanned.

753
01:18:05.985 --> 01:18:08.422
10 hours a day. non-stop.

754
01:18:11.512 --> 01:18:13.384
A lot of the documents involved

755
01:18:13.427 --> 01:18:17.605
the fraudulent testing
of chemical products.

756
01:18:19.607 --> 01:18:22.480
So lawyers now in
bringing these lawsuits

757
01:18:22.523 --> 01:18:25.962
are being able to find that
information and use it.

758
01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:33.839
I hope they'll make trouble.

759
01:18:33.883 --> 01:18:35.754
I mean. that's the whole goal

760
01:18:35.798 --> 01:18:39.540
is to make them available
to anybody that needs them.

761
01:19:33.725 --> 01:19:36.859
[camera snapping]

762
01:19:38.338 --> 01:19:40.514
- Will you film
my tongue please?

763
01:19:44.127 --> 01:19:44.954
Can you see that?

764
01:19:47.739 --> 01:19:49.306
I am at the hospital

765
01:19:50.394 --> 01:19:51.830
and I'm getting ready to go into

766
01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:56.400
the decontamination shower.

767
01:19:56.443 --> 01:19:58.924
I showed them some
of the pamphlets

768
01:20:00.056 --> 01:20:00.883
of

769
01:20:02.406 --> 01:20:05.278
what I got sprayed with
and this one right here.

770
01:20:05.322 --> 01:20:07.498
they seemed to be
very concerned about.

771
01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:09.848
They have told me
to come out here

772
01:20:09.892 --> 01:20:13.373
and stand here because they
don't want me in the hospital

773
01:20:13.417 --> 01:20:18.248
and so I'm being treated like
a biological hazard here.

774
01:20:21.164 --> 01:20:22.774
I just got up.

775
01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:23.775
This is what...

776
01:20:26.299 --> 01:20:27.953
[Darryl coughs]

777
01:20:27.997 --> 01:20:29.694
The only way I can
sleep at night...

778
01:20:32.392 --> 01:20:34.177
is eating lots of those

779
01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.657
'cause I can't breathe right
due to these chemicals.

780
01:20:36.701 --> 01:20:38.659
This is my old rag
I have at night

781
01:20:39.922 --> 01:20:41.662
by the bed and obviously.

782
01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:44.404
you can see I'm using
it for. really nasty.

783
01:20:44.448 --> 01:20:46.058
I know this is a nasty video but

784
01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:48.582
this is the crap that's
coming out of me.

785
01:20:49.453 --> 01:20:50.933
[coughs]

786
01:20:53.457 --> 01:20:55.502
- [Susan] There's a
wonderful saying that

787
01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:57.417
if you think you're too
little to make a difference.

788
01:20:57.461 --> 01:20:59.855
then you have never been
in bed with a mosquito.

789
01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.337
- It is with great pleasure
that the conference co-directors

790
01:21:04.381 --> 01:21:07.253
of the 36th annual Public
Interest Environmental Law

791
01:21:07.297 --> 01:21:10.256
Conference select Carol
Van Strum as a recipient

792
01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:13.520
of this year's David Brower
Lifetime Achievement Award

793
01:21:13.564 --> 01:21:15.609
in recognition of her
outstanding environmental

794
01:21:15.653 --> 01:21:18.264
social justice work in
Lincoln County. Oregon.

795
01:21:18.308 --> 01:21:21.311
[people applauding]

796
01:21:22.965 --> 01:21:26.664
- I just want to thank everybody
for making this happen.

797
01:21:26.707 --> 01:21:29.493
It's amazing and the other thing

798
01:21:29.536 --> 01:21:33.149
I want to say is that
it was never about me.

799
01:21:33.192 --> 01:21:35.978
It's always

800
01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:37.544
been a lot of other people.

801
01:21:37.588 --> 01:21:40.591
some of them not alive
with us today. [sniffs]

802
01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:47.903
And that's what's gonna make
the changes that are needed.

803
01:21:47.946 --> 01:21:50.383
I think you've got
several generations

804
01:21:50.427 --> 01:21:52.690
coming up of
troublemakers that'll do

805
01:21:52.733 --> 01:21:55.649
a whole lot more than
any of us did. I hope.

806
01:21:55.693 --> 01:21:58.522
