00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.521
Yeah. occasionally I drive out
just to eat here. actually.

183
00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:01.437
I'm trying to figure out
his special spice blend.

184
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:03.395
It's amazing what gems
you can find

185
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.093
in such unexpected places.

186
00:08:05.267 --> 00:08:07.922
Wow. thank you for
the daily aphorism.

187
00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:09.271
Anytime.

188
00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:13.841
Doing some homework. huh?

189
00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:15.625
Yeah.

190
00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:16.844
I'm beginning to wonder
what I got myself into.

191
00:08:17.018 --> 00:08:18.672
That's not a very good sign.

192
00:08:18.846 --> 00:08:19.629
But congratulations?

193
00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:21.283
Oh. no!

194
00:08:21.457 --> 00:08:24.416
No. I'm not the one doing
the getting married.

195
00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:26.462
I'm single.

196
00:08:26.636 --> 00:08:28.072
I mean. I'm not single.

197
00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:30.988
I have a boyfriend.
and we have a plan.

198
00:08:31.162 --> 00:08:32.599
My mistake.

199
00:08:32.773 --> 00:08:34.992
But hot tip: it's actually
"best wishes."

200
00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:37.691
Oh. thanks for the tip.

201
00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:39.780
Thank you for the fries.

202
00:08:39.954 --> 00:08:42.652
I should. probably I should
get going.

203
00:08:43.784 --> 00:08:46.395
Well hey...
good luck with all that.

204
00:08:46.569 --> 00:08:49.093
Thank you. good luck
with your spice quest.

205
00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:50.965
Best wishes!

206
00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:23.867
There she is!

207
00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:25.913
Henry. she's here.

208
00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.525
At long last!

209
00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:32.615
I miss one birthday
and I never hear the end of it!

210
00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:34.617
Thank you for swooping in
and saving us!

211
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:36.227
Oh. yeah.

212
00:09:36.401 --> 00:09:38.621
Cassie. I want you
to meet my fiancé. Henry.

213
00:09:38.795 --> 00:09:41.972
Henry. this is my favorite
only daughter. Cassie.

214
00:09:42.146 --> 00:09:44.105
Who's also our
new wedding planner!

215
00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:45.889
Hey. easy on the titles.

216
00:09:46.063 --> 00:09:47.978
I'm just here to help out
as much as I can.

217
00:09:48.152 --> 00:09:49.632
It's so nice to meet you.
Cassie.

218
00:09:49.806 --> 00:09:51.503
I've heard so much about you.

219
00:09:51.678 --> 00:09:52.940
Any favorite daughter
of Bonnie's

220
00:09:53.114 --> 00:09:54.898
is a favorite daughter of mine!

221
00:09:55.072 --> 00:09:56.552
It's nice to meet you. too.

222
00:09:56.726 --> 00:09:58.032
Come on in.

223
00:09:58.206 --> 00:09:59.773
Hey so tell me.
how was the drive?

224
00:10:02.297 --> 00:10:05.692
I got you all set up
with fresh sheets and towels!

225
00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:08.695
Marrying your father

226
00:10:08.869 --> 00:10:11.785
was the best day of my life.
you know.

227
00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:14.744
And this one coming up
will be too.

228
00:10:14.918 --> 00:10:18.530
Not better or worse.
just different.

229
00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:20.532
But the one
definite bonus is

230
00:10:20.707 --> 00:10:22.709
that I get to spend it
with you!

231
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.102
Well. we'd better
get started then.

232
00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:26.713
What shall we start with first?

233
00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:28.671
-Oh. I have a list.
-Oh. good.

234
00:10:29.716 --> 00:10:32.719
This was our former planner's
work binder.

235
00:10:32.893 --> 00:10:35.156
It should have all the
vendor orders and contacts.

236
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.027
Well. perfect!

237
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:38.768
At a week out. I assume
we're down to final details.

238
00:10:38.942 --> 00:10:41.728
Well. we're still looking
at caterers. right?

239
00:10:41.902 --> 00:10:44.295
That is a bit of a big detail.

240
00:10:45.253 --> 00:10:48.473
Do you guys have a theme
or a vision for the wedding?

241
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:49.736
I don't know...

242
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.476
Love?

243
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.827
You know what they say:
love is all you need.

244
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:55.176
I'm going to go
make some phone calls.

245
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.830
Great!

246
00:10:57.004 --> 00:10:59.920
It's actually time
for our daily cardio.

247
00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:01.443
Right.

248
00:11:01.617 --> 00:11:02.574
Trying to get our
wedding bods in shape!

249
00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:03.967
Oh. very good.

250
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:09.712
Hey. have a great run.

251
00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:10.931
Alright. ready?

252
00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:12.236
I'll race you to the--

253
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.151
Oh no. I get a head start!

254
00:11:23.073 --> 00:11:26.424
[phone ringing]

255
00:11:28.296 --> 00:11:29.689
Hi. Kyle here.

256
00:11:29.863 --> 00:11:31.865
Hi. I'm calling
about a catering event

257
00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:33.823
for a wedding next weekend.
June 23rd?

258
00:11:33.997 --> 00:11:35.216
The bride's last name
is Mitchell?

259
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.696
Right. yeah.

260
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.610
You said you were going to call

261
00:11:38.785 --> 00:11:42.223
to set up an interview.
but you never did.

262
00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:44.660
Oh. that was the former planner.

263
00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:46.749
I'm the new planner. I'm Cassie.

264
00:11:46.923 --> 00:11:48.142
Oh. well okay.

265
00:11:48.316 --> 00:11:49.970
-Hi. Cassie.
-Hi!

266
00:11:50.144 --> 00:11:51.580
So I have a few questions.

267
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:54.278
Umm... first off.

268
00:11:54.452 --> 00:11:57.194
What is your
catering company's name?

269
00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:00.676
Shack. Shack Catering.

270
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.286
Very quirky!

271
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:07.857
Can you tell me a little bit
about your culinary experience?

272
00:12:08.031 --> 00:12:10.381
I attended the Culinary
Institute in New York.

273
00:12:10.555 --> 00:12:14.995
I followed that up with a series
of noteworthy apprenticeships.

274
00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:18.302
One in Paris and
the other in New York.

275
00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:21.349
Okay. well that
sounds promising!

276
00:12:21.523 --> 00:12:23.655
You know. maybe
we could just set up

277
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.701
an in-person interview instead?

278
00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:28.356
Oh. I was just going
to suggest that!

279
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.184
Great. can you actually
meet this afternoon?

280
00:12:30.358 --> 00:12:31.576
I can come to you.

281
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:33.056
Yeah. why not?

282
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.363
-I'll send you the address.
-Perfect!

283
00:12:35.537 --> 00:12:37.713
I wish you'd just pull
that catering ad.

284
00:12:37.887 --> 00:12:38.975
Why?
We need the extra revenue.

285
00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:40.281
No we don't. we're doing fine.

286
00:12:40.455 --> 00:12:41.978
Barely fine.

287
00:12:42.152 --> 00:12:43.806
Not exactly what every
entrepreneur strives for.

288
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.373
We have a devoted following!

289
00:12:45.547 --> 00:12:46.940
We have a niche following.

290
00:12:47.114 --> 00:12:49.029
We're not supposed
to be a secret club.

291
00:12:49.203 --> 00:12:50.682
Catering could be good to us.

292
00:12:50.857 --> 00:12:52.162
It's free advertising.

293
00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:53.685
Plus. you could
try something new.

294
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.035
Maybe add something new
to the menu.

295
00:12:55.209 --> 00:12:56.863
Maybe something elevated.

296
00:12:57.037 --> 00:12:58.603
You know I hate that term.

297
00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:00.431
What term. elevated?

298
00:13:00.605 --> 00:13:02.216
It's so pretentious and actually
doesn't mean anything.

299
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.000
And there's nothing wrong
with our menu.

300
00:13:04.174 --> 00:13:05.175
There are five mains
on the menu.

301
00:13:05.349 --> 00:13:06.916
There are five great mains!

302
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.396
They haven't changed
in three years.

303
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:09.832
you gotta be bored
out of your skull.

304
00:13:10.006 --> 00:13:11.181
I'm not bored. no!

305
00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:12.966
I just know what's good.

306
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.750
Why don't you try digging
into your old repertoire?

307
00:13:14.924 --> 00:13:17.057
Let's open dinner
with a different concept!

308
00:13:18.232 --> 00:13:19.711
One thing is for sure.

309
00:13:19.886 --> 00:13:21.888
I never tire of your brisket.

310
00:13:22.062 --> 00:13:23.498
Thank you.

311
00:13:23.672 --> 00:13:25.326
Speaking of brisket.
make me a sandwich.

312
00:13:26.414 --> 00:13:28.198
When this Cassie woman calls.

313
00:13:28.372 --> 00:13:30.810
can you just tell her
I'm in the back?

314
00:13:30.984 --> 00:13:32.333
Make me a sandwich.

315
00:13:32.507 --> 00:13:33.160
Yes. making you
a sandwich brother.

316
00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:34.465
Thank you!

317
00:13:35.902 --> 00:13:39.253
[upbeat rock music]

318
00:14:04.147 --> 00:14:05.279
Hello?

319
00:14:08.543 --> 00:14:09.936
Good afternoon...

320
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.111
Hi.

321
00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:13.330
I'm looking for Shack Catering?

322
00:14:13.504 --> 00:14:16.116
You'll want to talk
to my brother. the chef.

323
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.682
He's on the patio.

324
00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:18.945
Follow me.

325
00:14:19.641 --> 00:14:21.643
Kyle. your three-o-clock
is here!

326
00:14:22.513 --> 00:14:23.471
Hey.

327
00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:26.256
Kyle?

328
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.736
Cassie?

329
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:28.824
You're a caterer?

330
00:14:28.998 --> 00:14:30.434
And a carpenter?

331
00:14:30.608 --> 00:14:33.133
Oh no no. this is just a hobby.

332
00:14:33.307 --> 00:14:34.134
Is it for your kids?

333
00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:36.223
Oh no. no kids here.

334
00:14:36.397 --> 00:14:37.311
My niece and nephew.

335
00:14:37.485 --> 00:14:39.356
They're Phil's kids.

336
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.097
Oh. okay.

337
00:14:41.271 --> 00:14:43.230
Shall we head inside and chat?

338
00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:45.014
Great. sounds good.

339
00:14:47.538 --> 00:14:48.322
Have a seat.

340
00:14:48.496 --> 00:14:49.540
Thanks.

341
00:14:49.714 --> 00:14:51.238
Phil. would you like to join us?

342
00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:52.935
No I'm just going
to linger awkwardly over here

343
00:14:53.109 --> 00:14:55.416
and read my paper.

344
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.070
He's my brother.

345
00:14:58.027 --> 00:14:59.072
So you're a wedding planner?

346
00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:00.073
Yeah!

347
00:15:00.247 --> 00:15:01.770
No!

348
00:15:01.944 --> 00:15:04.816
I'm a CPA. but my mom's
former planner fell through.

349
00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:06.906
so I'm just helping her out.

350
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.778
That's really nice of you.

351
00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:11.954
So this is our menu.

352
00:15:12.128 --> 00:15:13.390
Fun!

353
00:15:13.564 --> 00:15:15.392
So. Saturday the 23rd?

354
00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:17.351
That's a week from today.

355
00:15:17.525 --> 00:15:18.395
How many guests?

356
00:15:18.569 --> 00:15:20.397
85.

357
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:22.356
Sorry. I think I misunderstood.

358
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.532
I thought you were
a caterer caterer.

359
00:15:24.706 --> 00:15:26.534
Like canapés and
little baby quiches

360
00:15:26.708 --> 00:15:28.231
and chicken or shrimp.

361
00:15:28.405 --> 00:15:31.800
That doesn't sound
very original.

362
00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:33.497
But it's kind of what
you do for a wedding.

363
00:15:33.671 --> 00:15:37.414
We are flexible and
amenable to requests.

364
00:15:37.588 --> 00:15:40.069
This is what we do best.

365
00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:42.028
And I happen to know
that there are some

366
00:15:42.202 --> 00:15:45.901
very popular brazen trends
in catering right now.

367
00:15:46.075 --> 00:15:47.772
You got food trucks. taco bars.

368
00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.078
Why not barbecue?

369
00:15:49.252 --> 00:15:50.514
I get it. yeah.

370
00:15:50.688 --> 00:15:52.821
I think I was just
hoping for something

371
00:15:52.995 --> 00:15:56.433
a little more elevated
for this special occasion.

372
00:15:57.521 --> 00:15:59.480
You had mentioned you have a
background in French cuisine?

373
00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:01.177
Sure.

374
00:16:01.351 --> 00:16:02.222
And I take all those skills
that I learned

375
00:16:02.396 --> 00:16:04.006
and I apply them here.

376
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.357
Food doesn't have to be
elevated to be amazing.

377
00:16:07.531 --> 00:16:08.706
Cool.

378
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.100
Okay well. thank you
for your time.

379
00:16:11.274 --> 00:16:12.536
I have all your info.

380
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.494
I am seeing a couple
of other companies.

381
00:16:13.668 --> 00:16:15.235
so I'll let you know.

382
00:16:17.324 --> 00:16:18.890
It's was nice to meet you again!

383
00:16:19.065 --> 00:16:20.066
Yeah. you too.

384
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.067
It's nice to meet you. Phil.

385
00:16:21.241 --> 00:16:22.285
Buh-bye.

386
00:16:24.722 --> 00:16:27.203
Well. looks like that's that.

387
00:16:27.377 --> 00:16:28.509
Nice work.

388
00:16:35.646 --> 00:16:37.083
Here at the Cozy-Lux Inn.

389
00:16:37.257 --> 00:16:39.085
tables and chairs
are all included.

390
00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:43.045
We have a darling little archway
we can put up for the ceremony.

391
00:16:43.219 --> 00:16:46.222
You're currently signed up
for the silver package.

392
00:16:46.396 --> 00:16:50.270
We do have a gold package
that includes catering.

393
00:16:50.444 --> 00:16:51.488
That's good to know!

394
00:16:51.662 --> 00:16:53.273
I was a little stuck on that.

395
00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:55.449
You can't beat the
convenience and practicality

396
00:16:55.623 --> 00:16:57.277
of keeping vendors in-house.

397
00:16:57.451 --> 00:16:59.192
Sure.

398
00:16:59.366 --> 00:17:01.455
You have a lot of
freedom with decorating.

399
00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:03.674
People like going with balloons!

400
00:17:04.501 --> 00:17:06.634
Was there an event
in here earlier today?

401
00:17:06.808 --> 00:17:08.549
No. why do you ask?

402
00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:11.639
Oh. I'm getting a
strong scent of...

403
00:17:13.641 --> 00:17:14.903
Roast beef?

404
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:16.600
I like roast beef.

405
00:17:17.688 --> 00:17:23.651
Maybe that's just the smell
of hundreds of happy memories.

406
00:17:23.825 --> 00:17:25.914
Well. I'll let you guys
poke around.

407
00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:27.568
Thank you.

408
00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:32.486
You guys picked this place?

409
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.878
Well. we didn't pick it.

410
00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.055
It's what was available.

411
00:17:36.229 --> 00:17:38.535
Ashley mentioned a plan
about decorating

412
00:17:38.709 --> 00:17:40.494
and brightening it up a bit.

413
00:17:40.668 --> 00:17:42.322
Didn't quite see that
in the binder.

414
00:17:42.496 --> 00:17:45.151
I didn't see much in the binder.

415
00:17:49.459 --> 00:17:52.027
The in-house catering
is definitely a plus.

416
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:54.682
But how would you feel about
looking at other venues?

417
00:17:54.856 --> 00:17:58.120
I'm not sure there are better
options in Meadowville.

418
00:17:58.294 --> 00:18:00.296
Besides. the wedding
is coming up so fast.

419
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.385
The Cozy-Lux makes things easy.

420
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.561
There's no natural light. Mom!

421
00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:06.346
I can't help but think
that there's gotta be

422
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.608
a better option out there.

423
00:18:07.782 --> 00:18:10.001
Something that's more you.

424
00:18:10.176 --> 00:18:11.481
I'm just beginning to think

425
00:18:11.655 --> 00:18:13.092
I'm getting a
little carried away

426
00:18:13.266 --> 00:18:15.703
having a big celebration
in the first place.

427
00:18:15.877 --> 00:18:19.620
I'm no spring chicken
and it's my second wedding.

428
00:18:19.794 --> 00:18:21.535
I'm so excited about Henry.

429
00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:25.495
I was just excited
to do it up for once.

430
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:29.238
Besides. all that really matters
is that we're all together.

431
00:18:29.412 --> 00:18:30.457
Right?

432
00:18:30.631 --> 00:18:32.502
Well. as your wedding planner.

433
00:18:32.676 --> 00:18:36.245
I'm obliged to tell you that
that is a load of hooey.

434
00:18:36.419 --> 00:18:37.159
Hooey?

435
00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:38.204
[laughing]

436
00:19:18.331 --> 00:19:22.073
Your grandmother really knew
how to throw a party.

437
00:19:22.248 --> 00:19:24.250
She looks so happy!

438
00:19:24.424 --> 00:19:27.122
Oh. I forgot to mention.

439
00:19:27.296 --> 00:19:29.168
Gordon might not be able
to come to the wedding.

440
00:19:29.342 --> 00:19:30.299
-Oh no!
-Yeah.

441
00:19:30.473 --> 00:19:31.561
Is everything okay?

442
00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:33.737
Yeah no. Gordon's fine.

443
00:19:33.911 --> 00:19:35.522
It was just a lapse
in communication

444
00:19:35.696 --> 00:19:38.307
and his work is
at a critical point.

445
00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:41.049
You guys have been together
a long time now.

446
00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:44.313
Don't you think it's time
he popped the question?

447
00:19:44.487 --> 00:19:46.489
I don't think there
will be any pops.

448
00:19:46.663 --> 00:19:49.753
He's not exactly the
romantic showmanship type.

449
00:19:49.927 --> 00:19:51.581
Which is fine.

450
00:19:51.755 --> 00:19:53.148
There's no rush.

451
00:19:53.322 --> 00:19:55.150
Sounds like someone's
putting it off.

452
00:19:55.324 --> 00:19:58.153
[phone rings]

453
00:19:58.327 --> 00:19:59.850
Hello?

454
00:20:00.024 --> 00:20:01.112
Hi Cassie. this is Phil
from Shack Catering.

455
00:20:01.287 --> 00:20:03.811
Hi Phil.

456
00:20:03.985 --> 00:20:05.813
Before you make any
final catering decisions.

457
00:20:05.987 --> 00:20:08.468
I wanted to invite you
to an unofficial menu tasting.

458
00:20:08.642 --> 00:20:10.209
Kyle will be catering an event

459
00:20:10.383 --> 00:20:12.689
and perhaps you could
come by after. say 4PM?

460
00:20:12.863 --> 00:20:14.474
It's at Sycamore Park.

461
00:20:14.648 --> 00:20:16.302
Thanks for letting me know.

462
00:20:16.476 --> 00:20:17.781
I will check with
the bride and groom.

463
00:20:17.955 --> 00:20:19.827
Great.

464
00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:22.699
We'd really love the opportunity
to make your occasion special.

465
00:20:22.873 --> 00:20:24.310
Bye Phil.

466
00:20:24.484 --> 00:20:26.660
Hey. what was that?

467
00:20:26.834 --> 00:20:29.532
I just got you
a second interview.

468
00:20:29.706 --> 00:20:32.448
Look. I know we have our ongoing
banter about business goals.

469
00:20:32.622 --> 00:20:36.104
but the truth is
our finances aren't great.

470
00:20:36.278 --> 00:20:37.758
I know you have your ideals.

471
00:20:37.932 --> 00:20:39.673
but what good are they
if we have to close shop?

472
00:20:39.847 --> 00:20:40.761
Yeah. yeah.

473
00:20:47.507 --> 00:20:49.378
So I have my doubts
about this caterer.

474
00:20:49.552 --> 00:20:51.119
but I wanted to
bring you guys along

475
00:20:51.293 --> 00:20:52.468
just to get the
conversation going.

476
00:20:52.642 --> 00:20:55.254
Great. I'm so excited!

477
00:20:57.778 --> 00:21:01.434
Wait. is Kyle Billings
the caterer we're meeting?

478
00:21:01.608 --> 00:21:03.131
You know Kyle?

479
00:21:03.305 --> 00:21:04.524
Yeah. we eat at The BBQ Shack
all the time.

480
00:21:04.698 --> 00:21:06.177
His barbecue is the best.

481
00:21:06.352 --> 00:21:07.527
It's our favorite!

482
00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:09.529
Well. okay that's good.

483
00:21:09.703 --> 00:21:11.226
Just like hide all
of the excitement.

484
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.663
just in case I still
want to suss things out.

485
00:21:13.837 --> 00:21:16.275
You're the expert. honey.

486
00:21:16.449 --> 00:21:17.798
Hey Kyle.

487
00:21:17.972 --> 00:21:19.756
These are my clients.
Bonnie and Henry.

488
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.410
I know you two!

489
00:21:21.584 --> 00:21:22.846
I didn't realize you
were getting hitched!

490
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.326
-Well congratulations!
-Thank you.

491
00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.719
That's great.
Here. come on.

492
00:21:25.893 --> 00:21:27.329
Get out of the rain.

493
00:21:27.503 --> 00:21:28.591
It's rare we get a
sun shower like this.

494
00:21:28.765 --> 00:21:29.505
Thank you.

495
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:31.159
Here hop in.

496
00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:32.856
Recently I was actually informed

497
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.337
that it's congratulations
to the groom

498
00:21:35.511 --> 00:21:37.644
and best wishes for the bride.

499
00:21:37.818 --> 00:21:39.559
Apparently.
congratulations implies

500
00:21:39.733 --> 00:21:42.779
that the bride is lucky to
have earned the engagement.

501
00:21:42.953 --> 00:21:47.741
So it's probably best to say
best wishes to both.

502
00:21:47.915 --> 00:21:49.786
It should be
congratulations to me!

503
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.875
I'm the one who proposed!

504
00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:53.529
Yep!

505
00:21:53.703 --> 00:21:56.445
She was the hunter and I
was struck by her arrow!

506
00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:59.448
Well today. we have
pork and tri-tip.

507
00:21:59.622 --> 00:22:01.232
I took the liberty
of putting together

508
00:22:01.407 --> 00:22:03.626
a couple of plates for you
along with some sides.

509
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.802
So if you just sit tight.
I'll be right back.

510
00:22:05.976 --> 00:22:07.804
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

511
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.863
Good. isn't it?

512
00:22:23.037 --> 00:22:24.125
It is.

513
00:22:25.866 --> 00:22:28.216
I'm just not sure that
it's right for this occasion.

514
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.783
I mean Mom. can you imagine
eating this

515
00:22:29.957 --> 00:22:30.958
in your wedding dress?

516
00:22:31.132 --> 00:22:32.568
Birthday party. yes.

517
00:22:32.742 --> 00:22:33.917
Wedding?

518
00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:35.441
I don't know.

519
00:22:35.615 --> 00:22:37.094
You make a good point.

520
00:22:37.268 --> 00:22:39.619
I think for now maybe
we just keep our eye out

521
00:22:39.793 --> 00:22:41.621
for something a
little more elegant.

522
00:22:41.795 --> 00:22:44.319
Well I for one.
love his cooking.

523
00:22:44.493 --> 00:22:45.842
But you may be right.

524
00:22:46.016 --> 00:22:47.714
Something elegant would
be more fitting.

525
00:22:47.888 --> 00:22:51.979
I noticed the menu at the
Cozy-Lux was more upscale.

526
00:22:52.153 --> 00:22:55.286
I think I even saw
Chicken Kiev on the menu.

527
00:22:55.461 --> 00:22:57.854
Yeah. I like that idea.

528
00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:03.164
Well yeah. we can
keep that in mind.

529
00:23:05.514 --> 00:23:08.299
So you donate everything you
make here to the youth league?

530
00:23:08.474 --> 00:23:10.258
Yeah. all proceeds
go to the Frogs.

531
00:23:10.432 --> 00:23:12.216
It's a little project of mine.

532
00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:13.479
You write it off. right?

533
00:23:13.653 --> 00:23:14.480
Write it off?

534
00:23:14.654 --> 00:23:15.829
Yeah. for taxes.

535
00:23:16.003 --> 00:23:18.309
No. it's not why I do it.

536
00:23:18.484 --> 00:23:19.528
No. of course not.

537
00:23:19.702 --> 00:23:21.617
But there's no reason not to.

538
00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:24.533
If you're not writing it off.
you're actually losing money.

539
00:23:24.707 --> 00:23:26.013
I can't imagine your
profit margins

540
00:23:26.187 --> 00:23:27.754
are exceptionally high
at The Shack.

541
00:23:27.928 --> 00:23:29.886
So you've been speculating
about my profit margins?

542
00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:31.322
I can't help it.

543
00:23:31.497 --> 00:23:32.976
It's my job.

544
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.283
But I''m actually off topic.

545
00:23:35.457 --> 00:23:39.505
If you're still interested
in catering my mom's wedding.

546
00:23:39.679 --> 00:23:42.812
I would love to hire you.

547
00:23:42.986 --> 00:23:44.684
It's clear you care
about what you do.

548
00:23:44.858 --> 00:23:46.599
and I like that.

549
00:23:46.773 --> 00:23:49.558
Are you sure you can handle
my low brow cuisine?

550
00:23:49.732 --> 00:23:52.561
I don't think it's low brow.

551
00:23:52.735 --> 00:23:56.739
That being said. I will
need you to meet me at 23.

552
00:23:56.913 --> 00:23:59.699
actually let's make it 35%
of the way towards high brow.

553
00:23:59.873 --> 00:24:02.702
If only to save on
the dry cleaning costs.

554
00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:07.837
Okay. let's do it.

555
00:24:08.011 --> 00:24:09.012
For Bonnie and Henry.

556
00:24:09.186 --> 00:24:10.492
Okay.

557
00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:17.325
Well now that the catering
is all done.

558
00:24:17.499 --> 00:24:19.153
we just have to find a venue.

559
00:24:19.327 --> 00:24:22.461
I really do think the Cozy-Lux
will be just fine. honey.

560
00:24:22.635 --> 00:24:24.027
As your wedding planner.

561
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:26.029
I would like to do better
than just fine.

562
00:24:26.203 --> 00:24:27.944
What matters is
we're all together.

563
00:24:28.118 --> 00:24:32.514
Just think. your grandma Eleanor
got married in a barn.

564
00:24:32.688 --> 00:24:34.734
Just shows. anywhere
will work just fine.

565
00:24:34.908 --> 00:24:37.606
Hey. barn weddings are
all the rage right now.

566
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.608
As usual. grandma
was ahead of her time.

567
00:24:39.782 --> 00:24:41.915
My mom and dad's wedding
was outdoors.

568
00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:44.526
sort of a spring festival.

569
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.441
And there was this
huge thunderstorm

570
00:24:46.615 --> 00:24:49.400
that came in right
after the ceremony.

571
00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:53.840
So they had to band together
and move inside her dad's barn.

572
00:24:54.014 --> 00:24:57.104
But according to her.
it was magical.

573
00:24:57.278 --> 00:24:59.236
Well. I have an idea.

574
00:25:08.898 --> 00:25:10.944
[Henry]
It hasn't been in use for years.

575
00:25:11.118 --> 00:25:13.250
[Cassie]
It's perfect actually.

576
00:25:16.689 --> 00:25:17.733
Can I open the other side?

577
00:25:17.907 --> 00:25:18.865
Sure.

578
00:25:24.566 --> 00:25:26.568
Oh. this is fantastic.

579
00:25:29.702 --> 00:25:31.660
Let's say we wanted
to rent this space out.

580
00:25:31.834 --> 00:25:34.445
Could we maybe clean some
of this stuff out of the way?

581
00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.970
Do some painting and mending?

582
00:25:37.144 --> 00:25:39.668
You can do anything you like.
it's a barn.

583
00:25:39.842 --> 00:25:42.889
Oh honey. let's be reasonable.

584
00:25:43.063 --> 00:25:44.934
Okay so it might be a little
hard to imagine.

585
00:25:45.108 --> 00:25:48.416
but try and picture this place
all cleaned out and decorated.

586
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.984
We could add the market lights
for the reception.

587
00:25:51.158 --> 00:25:52.420
It'll be beautiful.

588
00:25:52.594 --> 00:25:54.248
It'll be rustic chic!

589
00:25:54.422 --> 00:25:57.033
Grounded and earthy.
with a little nod to vintage.

590
00:25:57.207 --> 00:25:59.993
You know. a subtle interplay
of sophistication and whimsy.

591
00:26:00.167 --> 00:26:01.342
just like you.

592
00:26:02.822 --> 00:26:03.997
That's very true.

593
00:26:04.171 --> 00:26:05.825
What do you think?

594
00:26:05.999 --> 00:26:07.783
I love it.

595
00:26:07.957 --> 00:26:10.003
It's a lot of work.

596
00:26:10.177 --> 00:26:14.224
You're not going to try
and do it alone. are you?

597
00:26:20.927 --> 00:26:21.841
Hey.

598
00:26:22.015 --> 00:26:23.582
Hey.

599
00:26:23.756 --> 00:26:24.931
Did I miss a meeting?

600
00:26:25.105 --> 00:26:27.847
No. I'm just dropping by.

601
00:26:28.717 --> 00:26:30.980
I wanted to express
how excited I am

602
00:26:31.154 --> 00:26:33.548
that you're catering
the wedding.

603
00:26:33.722 --> 00:26:37.683
And also to talk to you about
an additional opportunity.

604
00:26:37.857 --> 00:26:39.554
I found the perfect venue.

605
00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:42.035
but I may need
a hand prepping it.

606
00:26:42.209 --> 00:26:44.733
And maybe like a bit
of carpentry work.

607
00:26:44.907 --> 00:26:47.867
Which of course. is why
I thought of you.

608
00:26:48.041 --> 00:26:50.957
And if you'd be willing
to help me out.

609
00:26:51.131 --> 00:26:52.872
then I would obviously
pay you for your time.

610
00:26:53.046 --> 00:26:54.874
Also in return.
I could help you

611
00:26:55.048 --> 00:26:57.050
get your business finances
in order.

612
00:26:57.224 --> 00:26:58.529
No charge.

613
00:26:58.704 --> 00:27:01.010
You're obviously very talented

614
00:27:01.184 --> 00:27:02.708
and I think this place
could thrive.

615
00:27:02.882 --> 00:27:06.494
You see. that's the thing.

616
00:27:06.668 --> 00:27:09.671
I have to run this place
on top of the catering duties.

617
00:27:09.845 --> 00:27:11.238
I could fill in!

618
00:27:11.412 --> 00:27:13.501
It's about time
I pulled my weight.

619
00:27:13.675 --> 00:27:16.025
We could really use the
financial consulting. Kyle.

620
00:27:16.199 --> 00:27:18.941
Go. have fun.
make dreams come true!

621
00:27:19.115 --> 00:27:20.203
Okay.

622
00:27:20.377 --> 00:27:21.640
Let's do it.

623
00:27:21.814 --> 00:27:23.946
Alright. go hang up that apron.

624
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.295
Okay!

625
00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:27.080
Thank you.

626
00:27:33.129 --> 00:27:36.655
Okay. so I know it needs
a little bit of work. but...

627
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:40.571
People travel from all over

628
00:27:40.746 --> 00:27:43.879
for the perfect
rustic chic experience.

629
00:27:44.053 --> 00:27:45.794
And we have it right here!

630
00:27:45.968 --> 00:27:48.579
Now. it just needs
a little bit of love. you know?

631
00:27:48.754 --> 00:27:50.277
Picture this all cleared out.

632
00:27:50.451 --> 00:27:53.062
A light breeze.
some string lights.

633
00:27:53.236 --> 00:27:56.762
maybe a little backup ambiance
from some fireflies.

634
00:27:59.982 --> 00:28:01.549
Alright.

635
00:28:01.723 --> 00:28:02.724
Where do we start?

636
00:28:02.898 --> 00:28:04.857
Yeah. alright!

637
00:28:05.031 --> 00:28:06.815
There are so many options here.

638
00:28:06.989 --> 00:28:09.644
but I'm thinking that if we do
the ceremony in this area.

639
00:28:09.818 --> 00:28:10.776
then by later on
in the evening--

640
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.953
No. this is working so far.

641
00:28:14.127 --> 00:28:15.606
Okay.

642
00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:17.608
I did a some scene design
for theatre

643
00:28:17.783 --> 00:28:19.001
in high school and college.
so...

644
00:28:19.175 --> 00:28:20.786
Why didn't you pursue it
as a career?

645
00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.963
Oh. I did!
Well. I almost did.

646
00:28:24.137 --> 00:28:25.616
I wanted to be an event planner.

647
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:27.053
Which is. I guess.
why my mom thought

648
00:28:27.227 --> 00:28:28.924
I'd be any good at this.

649
00:28:29.098 --> 00:28:30.970
Well. seems to me to me
like you're doing just fine.

650
00:28:31.144 --> 00:28:32.145
Thank you.

651
00:28:32.319 --> 00:28:33.668
Did you want to add anything

652
00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:34.800
to the list for
the hardware store?

653
00:28:34.974 --> 00:28:37.193
Sure. let's take a look.

654
00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:39.065
This is a lot of paint.

655
00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:40.719
Yeah. I thought it might be nice

656
00:28:40.893 --> 00:28:42.155
to add some swaths
of light paint.

657
00:28:42.329 --> 00:28:43.678
Maybe like an eggshell.

658
00:28:43.852 --> 00:28:45.506
just brighten
the place up a bit.

659
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.335
Or you could just let the
natural wood do its own thing

660
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:50.206
and not try to make it
be something it isn't?

661
00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.817
Do its own thing?

662
00:28:51.991 --> 00:28:54.036
Yeah. if you're going rustic.
go rustic.

663
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.952
Right. but you don't want
to forget about the chic.

664
00:28:57.126 --> 00:28:58.693
And besides. I'm not
talking about

665
00:28:58.867 --> 00:29:00.913
painting the whole
barn. just accents.

666
00:29:01.087 --> 00:29:03.742
Is a barn really a place
for accents. though?

667
00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:06.353
Well as the designer.
I think that I would like--

668
00:29:06.527 --> 00:29:09.225
Not to quibble here.
but in this instance.

669
00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:11.184
aren't you the coordinator
and I'm the designer?

670
00:29:11.358 --> 00:29:14.970
As far as the structure
is concerned?

671
00:29:15.144 --> 00:29:17.146
You hired me for a reason.
right?

672
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.671
Okay well. let's table this.

673
00:29:20.846 --> 00:29:22.282
Great idea.

674
00:29:22.456 --> 00:29:23.109
We're getting ahead
of ourselves anyway.

675
00:29:23.283 --> 00:29:24.588
Absolutely.

676
00:29:24.763 --> 00:29:26.895
-I'll just be over here.
-Yeah. great.

677
00:29:28.462 --> 00:29:30.420
A little more to my side.

678
00:29:32.814 --> 00:29:34.033
I've gone ahead
and put in an order

679
00:29:34.207 --> 00:29:35.164
for the rose-gold
chiavari chairs.

680
00:29:35.338 --> 00:29:36.644
But the question is.

681
00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:40.039
do I go with the round
or the circular?

682
00:29:40.213 --> 00:29:42.302
All right. what do you think
is under this thing?

683
00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:44.043
Something harmless.

684
00:29:44.217 --> 00:29:45.740
Yeah sure. something harmless.

685
00:29:45.914 --> 00:29:47.394
Okay on three.

686
00:29:47.568 --> 00:29:49.309
The real question is:
why chiavari chairs?

687
00:29:49.483 --> 00:29:50.919
Oh. they're beautiful.

688
00:29:51.093 --> 00:29:52.703
They have these
gorgeous ornate backs.

689
00:29:52.878 --> 00:29:54.488
-I'll show you a photo.
-No. I know what they are.

690
00:29:54.662 --> 00:29:56.707
Don't you think they're
sort of a little expected?

691
00:29:56.882 --> 00:29:59.885
One. two. three.

692
00:30:00.059 --> 00:30:02.061
-I can't believe you!
-I can't believe you!

693
00:30:02.235 --> 00:30:04.237
If by expected.
you mean classic.

694
00:30:04.411 --> 00:30:06.065
No. I don't.

695
00:30:06.239 --> 00:30:07.762
I'm going to do it this time.
you're gonna listen.

696
00:30:07.936 --> 00:30:08.981
-Promise?
-Promise.

697
00:30:09.155 --> 00:30:10.504
On three.

698
00:30:10.678 --> 00:30:12.071
Okay well. I think
we can agree that

699
00:30:12.245 --> 00:30:13.376
this isn't a structural
design element.

700
00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.900
You follow me. promise?

701
00:30:15.074 --> 00:30:16.118
Yup.

702
00:30:16.292 --> 00:30:19.121
On three. One... two... three!

703
00:30:20.122 --> 00:30:21.907
See? Harmless.

704
00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:24.257
Its such a shame that we have
the ability to do anything

705
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:27.260
and you just want to play it
so by the book.

706
00:30:27.434 --> 00:30:29.175
What is wrong with
playing by the book?

707
00:30:29.349 --> 00:30:30.785
We're going to
haul this out of here.

708
00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:32.091
Why? It's a barn wedding.

709
00:30:32.265 --> 00:30:33.919
Isn't this part
of the aesthetic?

710
00:30:34.093 --> 00:30:35.746
What do you want. people
just hanging out on hay bales?

711
00:30:35.921 --> 00:30:36.747
Yes.

712
00:30:36.922 --> 00:30:38.184
No.

713
00:30:38.358 --> 00:30:40.403
You know. kids can play
on it and stuff.

714
00:30:41.361 --> 00:30:42.841
Please!

715
00:30:43.929 --> 00:30:45.191
Really?

716
00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:47.410
No.

717
00:30:50.326 --> 00:30:52.981
Okay. you're the boss.

718
00:30:53.155 --> 00:30:54.853
I am the boss.

719
00:30:55.027 --> 00:30:56.332
I'm the boss.

720
00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:00.119
[phone ringing]

721
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:02.773
What up. Wedding Planner
to the Stars?

722
00:31:02.948 --> 00:31:04.775
Ha. not quite!

723
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:05.820
How's it going?

724
00:31:05.994 --> 00:31:07.735
Oh. it's good.

725
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:09.780
I've definitely took a lot on.
but it's actually kind of cool.

726
00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:11.391
Do you at least have help?

727
00:31:11.565 --> 00:31:14.133
Yeah. I have this
caterer-carpenter person.

728
00:31:14.307 --> 00:31:16.135
Person? Interesting.

729
00:31:16.309 --> 00:31:18.093
He's definitely
not short on input.

730
00:31:18.267 --> 00:31:20.139
I'll tell you one thing
I don't miss about theatre.

731
00:31:20.313 --> 00:31:21.749
artistic temperaments.

732
00:31:21.923 --> 00:31:23.925
I doubt you don't miss them.

733
00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:26.101
You sound... something.

734
00:31:26.275 --> 00:31:27.233
Something?

735
00:31:27.407 --> 00:31:29.017
Yeah. energized?

736
00:31:29.191 --> 00:31:30.845
Fluttery?

737
00:31:31.019 --> 00:31:34.109
I guess I'm just excited
this is all actually

738
00:31:34.283 --> 00:31:35.545
kind of coming together.

739
00:31:35.719 --> 00:31:38.200
Speaking of.
the reason I called.

740
00:31:38.374 --> 00:31:41.203
I might have a fun opportunity.

741
00:31:41.377 --> 00:31:44.337
How would you feel about
DJ-ing my mom's wedding?

742
00:31:44.511 --> 00:31:45.904
You could come down
the day before.

743
00:31:46.078 --> 00:31:48.428
dust off the old equipment?

744
00:31:48.602 --> 00:31:50.299
-It would be an honor!
-Yes!

745
00:31:50.473 --> 00:31:52.171
I'll start putting
a playlist together.

746
00:31:52.345 --> 00:31:53.650
Okay. bye.

747
00:31:54.651 --> 00:31:55.957
Yes!

748
00:32:00.527 --> 00:32:02.964
Did you see we finally
got our poster from London?

749
00:32:03.138 --> 00:32:04.357
No. I didn't.

750
00:32:04.531 --> 00:32:06.011
It's right here.

751
00:32:08.622 --> 00:32:10.450
Oh wow!

752
00:32:10.624 --> 00:32:12.147
I don't know why. I always
thought it was Twelfth Night.

753
00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:15.281
Nope. I met Henry at
A Midsummer Night's Dream.

754
00:32:15.455 --> 00:32:17.109
Life imitating art!

755
00:32:17.283 --> 00:32:18.893
What do you mean?

756
00:32:19.067 --> 00:32:21.156
Oh you know. like all the
little errors and mishaps

757
00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.984
that brought us together.

758
00:32:23.158 --> 00:32:26.031
The course of true love
never did run smooth.

759
00:32:26.205 --> 00:32:28.076
I don't know that I know this.

760
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.905
Besides the confusion
of the night my ticket was for.

761
00:32:31.079 --> 00:32:33.908
luckily they let me in
on that Saturday.

762
00:32:34.082 --> 00:32:35.866
Three seats away from me.

763
00:32:36.041 --> 00:32:38.086
But then there was that young
couple that were flirting.

764
00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:39.827
so they wanted to
sit next to each other.

765
00:32:40.001 --> 00:32:41.872
so we all moved around one way.

766
00:32:42.047 --> 00:32:45.572
Then things went sour and
they wanted to move apart.

767
00:32:45.746 --> 00:32:47.400
Just like the two couples
in the play.

768
00:32:47.574 --> 00:32:49.402
So then just somehow.

769
00:32:49.576 --> 00:32:53.232
through all the shuffling.
I ended up next to your mother.

770
00:32:53.406 --> 00:32:55.190
And what can I say?

771
00:32:55.364 --> 00:32:59.542
The magic of the play
just washed over us.

772
00:32:59.716 --> 00:33:02.981
As if Puck cast a
spell on us as well!

773
00:33:03.155 --> 00:33:04.634
You know. Cassie did
the set design

774
00:33:04.808 --> 00:33:07.942
for A Midsummer Night's Dream
in high school

775
00:33:08.116 --> 00:33:09.639
and that little high school

776
00:33:09.813 --> 00:33:11.946
is what started my enthusiasm
for The Bard.

777
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.556
Oh?

778
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.863
In fact. I dare say
that production stood up

779
00:33:16.037 --> 00:33:17.256
to the one we saw.

780
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.562
I dare say you're a bit biased.

781
00:33:21.477 --> 00:33:22.826
Of course.

782
00:33:23.653 --> 00:33:25.873
It sounds like you're making
unnecessary work for yourself.

783
00:33:26.047 --> 00:33:27.048
Yeah. but you had to see it.

784
00:33:27.222 --> 00:33:28.441
Those carpets were awful.

785
00:33:28.615 --> 00:33:30.138
and there was no natural light.

786
00:33:30.312 --> 00:33:33.446
I want to make it
special for her.

787
00:33:34.447 --> 00:33:37.232
Anyways. any luck on Saturday?

788
00:33:37.406 --> 00:33:40.061
Did you get a chance
to move that meeting?

789
00:33:40.235 --> 00:33:43.021
No. I doubt it'll change.

790
00:33:43.195 --> 00:33:45.980
I thought we were settled
on that. anyways.

791
00:33:46.154 --> 00:33:49.984
Yeah. but I thought you
would at least try.

792
00:33:50.158 --> 00:33:52.291
We'll see each other
soon enough.

793
00:33:52.465 --> 00:33:54.336
That's not the point.

794
00:33:57.426 --> 00:33:58.645
You know...

795
00:33:59.776 --> 00:34:04.085
I think I just need
some time to think about us.

796
00:34:04.259 --> 00:34:05.956
I thought we were okay.

797
00:34:06.131 --> 00:34:07.828
I don't know.

798
00:34:08.002 --> 00:34:09.873
I'll call you when I get back
to Chicago on Sunday.

799
00:34:10.048 --> 00:34:11.179
Okay.

800
00:34:11.353 --> 00:34:12.528
Okay. bye.

801
00:34:24.105 --> 00:34:25.454
[bell ringing]

802
00:34:25.628 --> 00:34:26.499
It's just that
it's her special day.

803
00:34:26.673 --> 00:34:28.414
so I want something nice.

804
00:34:28.588 --> 00:34:32.940
Like. maybe a slightly
refined version of your menu.

805
00:34:33.114 --> 00:34:35.943
Maybe like something with dough
or little cakes.

806
00:34:36.117 --> 00:34:37.988
or you know what I'm picturing?

807
00:34:38.163 --> 00:34:40.382
A fancy pop tart.

808
00:34:40.556 --> 00:34:42.471
You really don't know anything
about cuisine. do you?

809
00:34:42.645 --> 00:34:44.647
No. that's why I have you!

810
00:34:44.821 --> 00:34:46.127
[bell ringing]

811
00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:48.651
Don't do that.

812
00:34:48.825 --> 00:34:50.218
I once went to this wedding

813
00:34:50.392 --> 00:34:51.350
where they had these cute
mini egg rolls.

814
00:34:51.524 --> 00:34:53.047
Absolutely not.

815
00:34:53.221 --> 00:34:55.005
I will not make
anything with cute. little.

816
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.181
or mini in front of it.

817
00:34:56.355 --> 00:34:59.053
And nothing with toothpicks!

818
00:34:59.227 --> 00:35:00.576
Wow. what did hors d'oeuvres
ever do to you?

819
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:01.795
Terrible things.

820
00:35:03.579 --> 00:35:07.279
No. I just think that those
things are fake sophisticated.

821
00:35:07.453 --> 00:35:09.150
There's no art. there's no soul.

822
00:35:09.324 --> 00:35:12.719
Food should just be honest
with itself!

823
00:35:12.893 --> 00:35:15.243
Yes Cassie. beware all
the maniacal food out there

824
00:35:15.417 --> 00:35:16.897
lying to itself!

825
00:35:19.595 --> 00:35:21.206
You're an enigma. Kyle.

826
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.383
You're like a snob.

827
00:35:24.557 --> 00:35:27.125
but a snob about
not being a snob.

828
00:35:27.299 --> 00:35:28.865
But also. kind of a snob.

829
00:35:29.823 --> 00:35:31.346
[phone vibrating]

830
00:35:32.782 --> 00:35:35.437
Oh sorry it's just work.
one second...

831
00:35:35.611 --> 00:35:37.613
You couldn't get time off
for your mom's wedding?

832
00:35:37.787 --> 00:35:39.224
No. I did.

833
00:35:39.398 --> 00:35:40.747
I'm just up for a promotion.

834
00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:42.401
so I don't want my work
to lag too much.

835
00:35:42.575 --> 00:35:45.578
And normally. I find it
quite soothing.

836
00:35:45.752 --> 00:35:47.449
Explain.

837
00:35:47.623 --> 00:35:50.496
It's just satisfying when all
the numbers shake out.

838
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:54.282
It's like. everything just lines
up.

839
00:35:54.456 --> 00:35:57.111
It's like everything
is going to be okay.

840
00:35:57.285 --> 00:36:00.419
That's...
astonishingly... dorky.

841
00:36:02.638 --> 00:36:04.379
Speaking of...

842
00:36:04.553 --> 00:36:06.729
I think it's my turn to hold up
my end of the bargain.

843
00:36:06.903 --> 00:36:09.732
Shall we take a gander
at last year's taxes?

844
00:36:09.906 --> 00:36:11.299
Can't wait.

845
00:36:13.823 --> 00:36:15.434
-You mean now?
-Yeah.

846
00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:32.146
This is your filing cabinet?

847
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.715
Okay look. I understand
your skepticism.

848
00:36:35.889 --> 00:36:38.631
but everything has
been running just fine.

849
00:36:38.805 --> 00:36:41.590
We pay our bills.
we haven't been burned down.

850
00:36:41.764 --> 00:36:43.679
If it ain't broke...

851
00:36:43.853 --> 00:36:46.595
Besides. I do have a system.

852
00:36:46.769 --> 00:36:52.340
Tax returns are in April.

853
00:36:52.514 --> 00:36:55.604
So that's about a fourth of
the way up from the bottom.

854
00:36:57.563 --> 00:36:59.434
Okay.

855
00:36:59.608 --> 00:37:01.784
Would you hold this. please?

856
00:37:04.439 --> 00:37:07.268
Explain what's going
on back there.

857
00:37:07.442 --> 00:37:09.314
That's the kitchen.

858
00:37:10.532 --> 00:37:13.231
This is the line.
this is the grill.

859
00:37:13.405 --> 00:37:14.232
That's the fridges--

860
00:37:14.406 --> 00:37:16.190
That's not what I meant.

861
00:37:16.364 --> 00:37:19.237
I can't help but notice that it
is especially orderly in there.

862
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:20.934
Well. that's mise en place.

863
00:37:21.108 --> 00:37:23.502
It's a system. or philosophy
that chefs use.

864
00:37:23.676 --> 00:37:25.373
It means everything
in its place.

865
00:37:25.547 --> 00:37:26.853
If everything is in its place.

866
00:37:27.027 --> 00:37:29.116
then there is order.
and you know.

867
00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:31.858
service is that
much more smoother.

868
00:37:32.032 --> 00:37:33.163
It's an ethical code. really.

869
00:37:33.338 --> 00:37:35.035
Right.

870
00:37:35.209 --> 00:37:37.777
Anywhere else you could
maybe apply that philosophy?

871
00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:40.519
Also. I know what a
mise en place is. dummy.

872
00:37:40.693 --> 00:37:42.825
I've seen the food network.

873
00:37:44.827 --> 00:37:46.089
Excuse me. dummy?

874
00:37:46.786 --> 00:37:49.789
I hate to say it.
but you might need to pull back

875
00:37:49.963 --> 00:37:50.877
on the charity gigs.

876
00:37:51.051 --> 00:37:52.095
No. it's not an option.

877
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:53.358
Why not?

878
00:37:53.532 --> 00:37:55.011
Because it's too
important to me.

879
00:37:55.185 --> 00:37:56.796
I don't see the point
in doing any of this

880
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.234
if I'm not giving back
in some way.

881
00:38:00.408 --> 00:38:02.454
I understand that.
but you can't sustain it

882
00:38:02.628 --> 00:38:04.194
unless you offset it
with more revenue.

883
00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:06.196
That is just math.

884
00:38:06.371 --> 00:38:08.198
But I understand
it's a lot to take in.

885
00:38:08.373 --> 00:38:09.243
Question?

886
00:38:09.417 --> 00:38:10.723
Yeah?

887
00:38:10.897 --> 00:38:13.116
Why all the reluctance
to anything

888
00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.554
upscale or elevated?

889
00:38:15.728 --> 00:38:19.297
It's this assumption
that upscale is better.

890
00:38:20.515 --> 00:38:22.125
I'll give you a perfect example.

891
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.607
I have been perfecting my
barbecue sauce for years.

892
00:38:25.781 --> 00:38:27.827
And there's just as
much reverence in that

893
00:38:28.001 --> 00:38:31.526
that there is in any
foie gras foam. or whatever.

894
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.572
Your barbecue sauce
is pretty good.

895
00:38:33.746 --> 00:38:35.922
What's in it?

896
00:38:36.096 --> 00:38:38.446
I'll tell you what's in it:

897
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.276
Lyon. Paris. New York.
my childhood.

898
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.931
Years of searching.
you name it.

899
00:38:45.105 --> 00:38:47.455
So it's a secret and
you're never going to tell me.

900
00:38:47.629 --> 00:38:53.418
No. I just like putting soul
and perfection in the familiar.

901
00:38:53.592 --> 00:38:56.421
Besides. it's more accessible.

902
00:38:56.595 --> 00:38:58.597
It can reach more people.

903
00:38:58.771 --> 00:39:00.033
Fair enough...

904
00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:10.304
Tell me what you see.

905
00:39:10.478 --> 00:39:11.653
The front of a restaurant.

906
00:39:11.827 --> 00:39:13.568
Yeah. but how would I know that?

907
00:39:13.742 --> 00:39:14.874
Does it look inviting?

908
00:39:15.048 --> 00:39:16.049
Well. it doesn't have to.

909
00:39:16.223 --> 00:39:17.790
It's the food that matters.

910
00:39:17.964 --> 00:39:19.879
Word of mouth. right?

911
00:39:20.053 --> 00:39:22.925
Plus this storefront
doesn't protest too much.

912
00:39:23.099 --> 00:39:25.363
I think that you should invest
in some signage

913
00:39:25.537 --> 00:39:28.714
that really represents you
and what you do.

914
00:39:28.888 --> 00:39:31.586
You can't afford to overlook
the walk in business.

915
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.893
Are you being an accountant
right now. or a designer?

916
00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:38.332
An accountant. and a friend.

917
00:39:38.506 --> 00:39:39.942
You do amazing things here.

918
00:39:40.116 --> 00:39:43.337
We need to get more people
to experience it!

919
00:39:43.511 --> 00:39:45.644
I'll think about it.

920
00:39:45.818 --> 00:39:47.167
I will take that.

921
00:39:52.128 --> 00:39:53.652
That's amazing.

922
00:39:53.826 --> 00:39:54.914
That's homemade?

923
00:39:55.088 --> 00:39:56.611
Oui madame.

924
00:39:56.785 --> 00:39:57.960
I didn't even know
butterscotch pudding

925
00:39:58.134 --> 00:39:59.527
could be homemade.

926
00:39:59.701 --> 00:40:02.356
Yeah well. I'm full
of surprises.

927
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.662
So tell me about your boyfriend.

928
00:40:03.836 --> 00:40:07.579
Oh. well his name is Gordon.

929
00:40:07.753 --> 00:40:09.319
He's an engineer.

930
00:40:09.494 --> 00:40:11.539
And he's working in
app development right now.

931
00:40:11.713 --> 00:40:16.283
He must be pretty excited
to see your work at the wedding.

932
00:40:16.457 --> 00:40:19.286
He won't be at the wedding.

933
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.896
Work stuff.

934
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.681
But it's probably for the best.

935
00:40:22.855 --> 00:40:26.336
I can just focus
on the planning.

936
00:40:26.511 --> 00:40:29.862
Yeah. that sounds practical.

937
00:40:30.036 --> 00:40:31.646
So what do you think about

938
00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:35.694
your mom and Henry's
whirlwind romance?

939
00:40:35.868 --> 00:40:37.130
Meeting in London on vacation

940
00:40:37.304 --> 00:40:39.828
and six months later
getting married?

941
00:40:40.002 --> 00:40:41.874
It's a bold move.

942
00:40:42.048 --> 00:40:44.877
But no. my mom.

943
00:40:45.051 --> 00:40:47.270
she's a smart lady.

944
00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:49.534
Well. you can't deny it.

945
00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:51.492
They are pretty cute.

946
00:40:51.666 --> 00:40:52.711
They are.

947
00:41:03.025 --> 00:41:06.681
Hey. want to join me and Henry
for a game of Monopoly?

948
00:41:07.639 --> 00:41:10.380
You can show him your
cutthroat accounting skills.

949
00:41:10.555 --> 00:41:12.078
I wish.

950
00:41:12.252 --> 00:41:14.950
Yeah I can't. I'm sorry. Mom.
I gotta work.

951
00:41:15.124 --> 00:41:17.475
Okay. just wanted to check.

952
00:41:17.649 --> 00:41:19.215
Don't work too hard.

953
00:41:27.223 --> 00:41:28.660
-Hey bro.
-Hey buddy.

954
00:41:28.834 --> 00:41:30.662
Is that what I think it is?

955
00:41:30.836 --> 00:41:33.142
Don't get too excited.
don't read into it too much.

956
00:41:33.316 --> 00:41:36.711
I went in to Des Moines today
and I was just feeling inspired.

957
00:41:36.885 --> 00:41:38.104
Inspired. huh?

958
00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:41.760
That's some French Brie.
right there.

959
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.767
Hey.

960
00:41:48.941 --> 00:41:50.682
Hey. good morning.

961
00:41:50.856 --> 00:41:52.118
Good morning.

962
00:41:52.292 --> 00:41:53.554
I'm sorry I'm so late.

963
00:41:53.728 --> 00:41:55.121
I was up late last night
doing work

964
00:41:55.295 --> 00:41:57.340
and I fell asleep
without setting my alarm.

965
00:41:57.515 --> 00:41:58.603
What's going on?

966
00:41:58.777 --> 00:41:59.865
The market lights arrived today.

967
00:42:00.039 --> 00:42:01.519
Oh!

968
00:42:01.693 --> 00:42:03.651
Inspired me to run
some more electricity.

969
00:42:03.825 --> 00:42:05.218
That's a good idea.

970
00:42:05.392 --> 00:42:07.568
Incidentally. I had
another good idea.

971
00:42:07.742 --> 00:42:09.527
Here. follow me.

972
00:42:10.963 --> 00:42:12.051
Okay.

973
00:42:12.704 --> 00:42:15.837
Okay. I still feel like
the space is too tight

974
00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:18.013
for both the reception
and the ceremony.

975
00:42:18.187 --> 00:42:21.800
so what if instead of renting.
we just build the tables?

976
00:42:21.974 --> 00:42:23.758
That might be a touch too DIY.

977
00:42:23.932 --> 00:42:25.499
Hear me out.

978
00:42:25.673 --> 00:42:27.414
We could easily build long.
farm-style tables.

979
00:42:27.588 --> 00:42:29.024
flanking the sides.

980
00:42:29.198 --> 00:42:30.504
Ronald has the lumber.

981
00:42:30.678 --> 00:42:32.680
and we can use barrels
as support.

982
00:42:32.854 --> 00:42:34.987
Then we could offset
the roughness

983
00:42:35.161 --> 00:42:36.858
with your chiavari chairs.

984
00:42:37.032 --> 00:42:38.860
This would leave room
for the ceremony.

985
00:42:39.034 --> 00:42:40.470
So do we use the chairs
for the ceremony

986
00:42:40.645 --> 00:42:41.776
and then we move them?

987
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:43.778
Either way. for the reception.

988
00:42:43.952 --> 00:42:47.608
we've just got to clear out this
whole middle space for dancing.

989
00:42:47.782 --> 00:42:49.305
[laughing]

990
00:42:49.479 --> 00:42:51.133
I also thought that
we should probably make

991
00:42:51.307 --> 00:42:52.744
some decisions
regarding food service.

992
00:42:52.918 --> 00:42:53.962
Okay.

993
00:42:54.136 --> 00:42:55.790
I feel like I'm a little torn.

994
00:42:55.964 --> 00:42:58.488
because full service
is a little advantageous

995
00:42:58.663 --> 00:43:00.055
presentation-wise.

996
00:43:00.229 --> 00:43:02.580
It just feels
stuffy for our concept.

997
00:43:02.754 --> 00:43:04.582
What if we did family style?

998
00:43:04.756 --> 00:43:06.453
Really?

999
00:43:06.627 --> 00:43:08.673
I assumed that you would think
that would be too casual.

1000
00:43:08.847 --> 00:43:12.546
A buffet would be too casual.
but family style is communal.

1001
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.201
It seems perfect.

1002
00:43:15.375 --> 00:43:17.420
We just agreed on something.

1003
00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:18.944
That's a first.

1004
00:43:19.118 --> 00:43:20.467
It is.

1005
00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:22.121
What are you thinking.
long or short?

1006
00:43:22.295 --> 00:43:24.079
I'm not sure.

1007
00:43:24.253 --> 00:43:26.299
I personally think that you
could rock the knee-length.

1008
00:43:28.257 --> 00:43:29.694
What is it?

1009
00:43:29.868 --> 00:43:31.739
Are you getting the
pre-wedding jitters?

1010
00:43:31.913 --> 00:43:33.436
We're wedding dress shopping.

1011
00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:34.568
This is supposed to be
the most magical part

1012
00:43:34.742 --> 00:43:35.787
of the wedding prep.

1013
00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:37.310
I just had a flash of wishing

1014
00:43:37.484 --> 00:43:39.529
we were shopping
for your wedding dress.

1015
00:43:39.704 --> 00:43:41.836
I'm hardly a spinster. mom.

1016
00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.534
I just want you to feel as head
over heels as I do now.

1017
00:43:44.709 --> 00:43:46.014
Who says I'm not?

1018
00:43:46.188 --> 00:43:47.625
Well. it's been a while

1019
00:43:47.799 --> 00:43:50.497
since I've seen your eyes
light up.

1020
00:43:50.671 --> 00:43:52.891
So are you thinking
contemporary. or vintage?

1021
00:43:53.065 --> 00:43:55.458
What do you think of Henry?

1022
00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:57.025
I think he's great.

1023
00:43:58.287 --> 00:44:00.942
He very obviously adores you.

1024
00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:02.683
I'm still just
getting to know him.

1025
00:44:02.857 --> 00:44:04.598
Are you?

1026
00:44:04.772 --> 00:44:07.775
I've kind of been busy
planning your fabulous wedding.

1027
00:44:07.949 --> 00:44:09.603
And by yours.
I mean yours and his.

1028
00:44:09.777 --> 00:44:11.257
I know.

1029
00:44:11.431 --> 00:44:13.694
But I was just wondering
if I could ask you

1030
00:44:13.868 --> 00:44:15.696
to make more of
an effort with him.

1031
00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.830
Nothing huge. just an effort.

1032
00:44:19.004 --> 00:44:20.266
It would mean the world to me.

1033
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.442
Yeah of course. Mom.

1034
00:44:23.443 --> 00:44:24.923
On one condition.

1035
00:44:25.097 --> 00:44:26.664
What?

1036
00:44:26.838 --> 00:44:28.230
You get excited about the
wedding dress shopping!

1037
00:44:28.404 --> 00:44:30.232
Okay. what do you have in mind?

1038
00:44:32.278 --> 00:44:35.934
So. what's the deal
with you and the ladies?

1039
00:44:37.196 --> 00:44:39.764
You got anything on the grill?

1040
00:44:39.938 --> 00:44:42.070
You know. cause you own
a barbecue restaurant...

1041
00:44:42.244 --> 00:44:43.855
with a grill?

1042
00:44:44.029 --> 00:44:45.726
[making grill noises]

1043
00:44:48.163 --> 00:44:52.907
I had a kind of big relationship
a few years back.

1044
00:44:53.081 --> 00:44:55.127
But it ended.

1045
00:44:55.301 --> 00:44:57.129
[making grill noises]

1046
00:44:57.303 --> 00:44:58.739
That's enough.

1047
00:45:00.393 --> 00:45:02.308
I know I've been asking
a lot of you lately.

1048
00:45:02.482 --> 00:45:05.311
but I was wondering
if you'd offer

1049
00:45:05.485 --> 00:45:07.313
to go with Henry
to the suit fitting?

1050
00:45:07.487 --> 00:45:10.620
It just occurred to me
that he's new here

1051
00:45:10.795 --> 00:45:13.754
and doesn't yet have a Cassie.

1052
00:45:13.928 --> 00:45:14.973
Of course!

1053
00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:22.632
It occurred to me the other day
that it must be hard for you.

1054
00:45:22.807 --> 00:45:25.723
Building this whole celebration
for your mom

1055
00:45:25.897 --> 00:45:28.334
marrying someone
who isn't your dad.

1056
00:45:28.508 --> 00:45:30.205
It has its moments.

1057
00:45:30.379 --> 00:45:31.816
You know. letting Henry in

1058
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:33.687
doesn't mean that
you're betraying your dad.

1059
00:45:33.861 --> 00:45:37.952
It doesn't mean that
you're erasing his memory.

1060
00:45:38.126 --> 00:45:40.346
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have that.

1061
00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:42.348
No. I'm glad you did.

1062
00:45:42.522 --> 00:45:45.307
Well before we call it a day.

1063
00:45:45.481 --> 00:45:47.135
there are still some
serious nuts and bolts

1064
00:45:47.309 --> 00:45:48.136
that need to be figured out.

1065
00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:49.877
What?

1066
00:45:50.051 --> 00:45:52.314
We need to figure out
if this space

1067
00:45:52.488 --> 00:45:54.708
is roomy enough for dancing.

1068
00:45:54.882 --> 00:45:56.144
Oh. knock yourself out.

1069

this is delicious.

1178

want to be a chef?

1183
00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.592

She studied in France.
much longer than I did.

1186
00:52:04.817 --> 00:52:08.299
Anyway. I was just
this really anxious kid.

1187

really stressed out.

1188
00:52:12.477 --> 00:52:15.219

with my favorite dessert.

So out of all the
set designs you made.

1211
00:53:22.503 --> 00:53:24.070
what would you say
your favorite one is?

1212
00:53:24.244 --> 00:53:25.158
Oh. easy.

1213
00:53:25.332 --> 00:53:26.551
Senior year of high school.

1214
00:53:26.725 --> 00:53:29.162
I did A Midsummer Night's Dream.

1215
00:53:29.336 --> 00:53:30.772
Explain.

1216
00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:34.211
Well. you know how
a lot of the play

1217
00:53:34.385 --> 00:53:35.995
takes place in the woods?

1218
00:53:36.169 --> 00:53:38.693
It's where fairies are
and all the magic happens.

1219
00:53:38.867 --> 00:53:41.392
The theatre in my high school
was pretty small.

1220
00:53:41.566 --> 00:53:44.656
so I ended up building
the set around the audience.

1221
00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:48.355
Sort of envelop them
in the magic of the woods.

1222
00:53:48.529 --> 00:53:52.141
I had like twinkle lights
for stars.

1223
00:53:52.316 --> 00:53:54.274
and vines everywhere.

1224
00:53:54.448 --> 00:53:56.363
You could almost smell
the summer night.

1225
00:53:56.537 --> 00:54:00.280
It was rough around the edges.
but it was earnest.

1226
00:54:01.368 --> 00:54:06.634
Listen. I've got a confession
I've got to make.

1227
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:11.813
This is my first
real catering gig.

1228
00:54:11.987 --> 00:54:13.859
-Really?
-Yeah.

1229
00:54:14.033 --> 00:54:17.166
Phil just kept putting
advertisements in the newspaper

1230
00:54:17.341 --> 00:54:20.735
and yours was the first one
to amount to anything.

1231
00:54:20.909 --> 00:54:23.869
You just seemed to know
so much about weddings.

1232
00:54:24.043 --> 00:54:27.307
Yeah. it's because
I planned my own.

1233
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:30.441
I didn't know you
had been married.

1234
00:54:30.615 --> 00:54:33.357
No. I never was.

1235
00:54:33.531 --> 00:54:37.839
My ex-fiancé called it off
at the last minute.

1236
00:54:38.013 --> 00:54:41.713
It was the day before. actually.

1237
00:54:41.887 --> 00:54:45.456
It was a big celebration.
an elaborate design.

1238
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:47.719
Chiavari chairs and everything.

1239
00:54:49.068 --> 00:54:50.722
We had planned to move
to New York.

1240
00:54:50.896 --> 00:54:54.378
We both had big jobs lined up.

1241
00:54:54.552 --> 00:54:56.902
I just ended up staying here.

1242
00:54:58.338 --> 00:55:01.472
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

1243
00:55:01.646 --> 00:55:04.344
So this job must be
hard for you.

1244
00:55:04.518 --> 00:55:06.738
No. it isn't actually.

1245
00:55:09.523 --> 00:55:11.743
It's kind of like
exorcising demons!

1246
00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:16.313
And I've had great company.

1247
00:55:16.487 --> 00:55:17.575
Me too.

1248
00:55:19.403 --> 00:55:20.839
Come on. I want to show
you something.

1249
00:55:21.013 --> 00:55:22.406
-Okay.
-Come on!

1250
00:55:37.769 --> 00:55:39.423
What is this?

1251
00:55:39.597 --> 00:55:41.425
Just a side project
I've been working on for fun.

1252
00:55:41.599 --> 00:55:42.643
For fun?

1253
00:55:42.817 --> 00:55:44.776
This is spectacular.

1254
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:47.996
I just I threw it together
with some spare lumber.

1255
00:55:50.869 --> 00:55:53.437
Why would you keep this
to yourself?

1256
00:55:58.093 --> 00:56:00.618
Oh. this light is perfect.

1257
00:56:02.402 --> 00:56:04.273
I think we need to have
the ceremony here.

1258
00:56:04.448 --> 00:56:06.363
Do you think
we'll need to decorate?

1259
00:56:06.537 --> 00:56:09.278
Some flowers and candles.
but this is perfect!

1260
00:56:09.453 --> 00:56:11.063
I mean the barn is
a five minute walk.

1261
00:56:11.237 --> 00:56:14.806
So people can just caravan
between the two spaces.

1262
00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.285
It's like A Midsummer
Night's Dream.

1263
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:17.896
You are a genius!

1264
00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:19.550
I can't believe I didn't
think about this myself.

1265
00:56:19.724 --> 00:56:20.812
I mean the barn will
still need some work.

1266
00:56:20.986 --> 00:56:23.989
but it'll be totally worth it!

1267
00:56:24.163 --> 00:56:27.732
The course of true love
never did run smooth!

1268
00:56:28.646 --> 00:56:29.734
Wait. wait...

1269
00:56:29.908 --> 00:56:31.562
I need more information!

1270
00:57:09.208 --> 00:57:10.992
You know it's two days
before the wedding. right?

1271
00:57:11.166 --> 00:57:12.690
Oh. I know!

1272
00:57:12.864 --> 00:57:13.865
So what about the all
the work we've done?

1273
00:57:14.039 --> 00:57:15.780
It stays!

1274
00:57:15.954 --> 00:57:18.391
We just integrate these elements
into what we already have.

1275
00:57:18.565 --> 00:57:19.740
We're just bringing
the outside in

1276
00:57:19.914 --> 00:57:21.655
and adding a little magic!

1277
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:23.309
We're going to make
flowers and leaves

1278
00:57:23.483 --> 00:57:25.354
from crepe paper and fabric

1279
00:57:25.529 --> 00:57:27.618
and then we intertwine
everything with fairy lights.

1280
00:57:27.792 --> 00:57:30.708
And it's like
the forest is aglow.

1281
00:57:30.882 --> 00:57:32.579
Alright.

1282
00:57:32.753 --> 00:57:33.885
Let's make magic.

1284
00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:00.781
Alright. it's time.

1285
00:58:00.955 --> 00:58:02.043
These guys gotta go.

1286
00:58:02.217 --> 00:58:03.741
Are you sure?

1287
00:58:03.915 --> 00:58:05.394
I mean. I know we settled
on chiavari chairs.

1288
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:07.005
but just look at these things.

1289
00:58:07.179 --> 00:58:12.532
They're so soft and bouncy
and aromatic.

1290
00:58:13.838 --> 00:58:16.231
Well. if you like
the smell that much...

1291
00:58:21.149 --> 00:58:22.629
Oh. you want to play
that game. do you?

1292
00:58:22.803 --> 00:58:25.806
[screaming and giggling]

1293
00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:29.723
Truce!

1294
00:58:29.897 --> 00:58:31.290
Okay. truce.

1295
00:58:35.947 --> 00:58:36.904
Hello?

1296
00:58:38.515 --> 00:58:39.124
[together]
Hey!

1297
00:58:39.298 --> 00:58:41.039
Hey guys.

1298
00:58:41.213 --> 00:58:42.736
I thought I'd bring by
some lunch for my worker bees.

1299
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:44.216
Great. thanks.

1300
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:46.044
Yeah. we were
just moving the hay.

1301
00:58:46.218 --> 00:58:48.873
Working. working hard.

1302
00:58:49.047 --> 00:58:50.831
-Yum...
-Gotta eat.

1303
00:58:51.005 --> 00:58:53.747
-Here you go. hungry?
-Thank you.

1304
00:59:00.232 --> 00:59:01.538
Hey...

1305
00:59:01.712 --> 00:59:02.800
Oh. hey!

1306
00:59:04.584 --> 00:59:05.585
How are you feeling?

1307
00:59:05.759 --> 00:59:07.805
Ready? Excited?

1308
00:59:07.979 --> 00:59:09.981
Yeah. all of the above.

1309
00:59:10.155 --> 00:59:11.983
I am really excited
for you guys to see

1310
00:59:12.157 --> 00:59:14.681
the new ceremony space
and the barn.

1311
00:59:14.855 --> 00:59:17.902
We added some elements I think
you guys are going to love.

1312
00:59:18.076 --> 00:59:20.034
I'm sure it'll be wonderful.

1313
00:59:20.208 --> 00:59:24.648
Your mom showed me some pictures
of your past scene design work.

1314
00:59:24.822 --> 00:59:26.519
It was truly impressive!

1315
00:59:26.693 --> 00:59:27.738
Thank you.

1316
00:59:29.609 --> 00:59:31.437
Sometimes I miss it.

1317
00:59:31.611 --> 00:59:34.658
And knowing Bonnie.
I'll bet she talked to you.

1318
00:59:34.832 --> 00:59:37.574
urging you to try real hard
to connect with me.

1319
00:59:39.314 --> 00:59:40.881
She may have.

1320
00:59:42.709 --> 00:59:46.713
Look. all I know is it moved
pretty quick for Bonnie and me.

1321
00:59:46.887 --> 00:59:49.847
so it must be lightning quick
for you.

1322
00:59:50.021 --> 00:59:52.850
So... no rush.

1323
00:59:54.068 --> 00:59:56.114
I'll be here.

1324
00:59:56.288 --> 00:59:57.768
Take your time.

1325
00:59:59.726 --> 01:00:01.641
-Thank you. Henry.
-Yeah.

1326
01:00:04.383 --> 01:00:05.950
Okay. see you later.

1327
01:00:06.124 --> 01:00:07.604
Talk to you later.

1328
01:00:29.321 --> 01:00:30.627
Hello?

1329
01:00:32.803 --> 01:00:35.022
-Hey.
-Hey.

1330
01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:36.545
You look nice.

1331
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.069
Thank you.

1332
01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:40.027
What's going on?

1333
01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:43.074
Well. I thought we would do
an unofficial menu tasting.

1334
01:00:43.248 --> 01:00:44.902
I'm still tweaking some things.

1335
01:00:45.076 --> 01:00:47.426
so I'd love to
get some feedback.

1336
01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:52.213
You'll really do anything
to avoid working on the books.

1337
01:00:52.387 --> 01:00:53.737
No comment.

1338
01:00:56.043 --> 01:00:58.829
I told you I trust you.
you didn't have to do all this.

1339
01:00:59.003 --> 01:01:01.875
I know. I just thought
it'd be fun.

1340
01:01:02.049 --> 01:01:04.225
I like the string lights.
by the way.

1341
01:01:04.399 --> 01:01:06.053
You should keep them.

1342
01:01:06.227 --> 01:01:09.143
Yeah. I was just auditioning
them. but yeah maybe.

1343
01:01:09.317 --> 01:01:10.971
Here. let me...

1344
01:01:13.104 --> 01:01:14.061
Thank you.

1345
01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:19.763
And I'll be right back.

1346
01:01:28.772 --> 01:01:30.948
Wow. I honestly thought

1347
01:01:31.122 --> 01:01:33.037
we were just going
with the standard menu.

1348
01:01:33.211 --> 01:01:36.127
Well. I wanted to try
some things.

1349
01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:40.305
Well thank you.
this is very nice.

1350
01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:43.569
Herbed Gougère?

1351
01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:45.223
The "h" is silent.

1352
01:01:47.921 --> 01:01:49.357
I don't know.

1353
01:01:49.531 --> 01:01:50.881
Looks an awful lot
like an hors d'oeuvre.

1354
01:01:51.055 --> 01:01:52.317
Well. it 100% is
an hors d'oeuvre.

1355
01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:54.406
I don't even recognize
you anymore.

1356
01:01:59.759 --> 01:02:01.630
Kyle. that is so good!

1357
01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:06.157
And this here is a caramelized
leek and cheese soufflé.

1358
01:02:06.331 --> 01:02:09.116
Let me know if the cheese
is too sharp.

1359
01:02:09.987 --> 01:02:10.988
This...

1360
01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:14.339
this is all incredible.

1361
01:02:14.513 --> 01:02:16.689
What brought it on?

1362
01:02:16.863 --> 01:02:20.649
I don't know. I was just
feeling inspired. I guess.

1363
01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:23.348
By you. actually.

1364
01:02:23.522 --> 01:02:26.743
And what you've created
for your mom.

1365
01:02:26.917 --> 01:02:29.267
It's extraordinary.

1366
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:34.620
Thank you.

1367
01:02:34.794 --> 01:02:37.536
This is extraordinary.

1368
01:02:44.848 --> 01:02:46.501
If I may say.

1369
01:02:46.675 --> 01:02:49.026
you can do no wrong putting
any one of those items

1370
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.331
on the everyday menu.

1371
01:02:50.505 --> 01:02:51.942
They'd be a hit.

1372
01:02:52.116 --> 01:02:53.334
Baby steps.

1373
01:02:56.294 --> 01:02:58.252
I cannot believe the wedding
is the day after tomorrow.

1374
01:02:58.426 --> 01:03:00.341
I know. me neither.

1375
01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:07.305
Are you excited to go back
to your normal life?

1376
01:03:11.352 --> 01:03:12.353
No.

1377
01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:17.837
I feel like I've
just been in this

this past week.

1379
01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.278
It's really been a dream.

1380
01:03:24.452 --> 01:03:26.933
It just feels surreal that
I'm going to have to wake up

1381
01:03:27.107 --> 01:03:31.285
and go back to Chicago.
to the firm.

1382
01:03:31.459 --> 01:03:33.766
You liked your life back there.

1383
01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:36.377
I do. yeah.

1384
01:03:36.551 --> 01:03:37.770
No. everything's great.

1385

Yeah no. everything's great.

1388
01:03:44.429 --> 01:03:45.430
Great.

1389
01:03:49.042 --> 01:03:52.959
It's just that this
has been special.

1390
01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:55.266
Yeah.

1391
01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:59.052
I think I know what you mean.

1392
01:04:03.056 --> 01:04:06.364
Well. I've got to get going.

1393
01:04:06.538 --> 01:04:08.148
I still have some work
to do tonight

1394

in the morning.

about the new menu. Kyle.

Hi Marina.

1398
01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:47.318
Hi Cassie.

1399
01:04:47.492 --> 01:04:49.233
Sorry to call so late.

1400
01:04:49.407 --> 01:04:51.844
I was just thinking of
the little query we had

1401
01:04:52.018 --> 01:04:53.846
in the hallway
about a couple weeks back.

1402
01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:56.501
As it turns out. we're doing
an investigative audit

1403
01:04:56.675 --> 01:05:01.027
for one of our new clients
and we are stretched quite thin.

1404
01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:03.029
Now I know you're with family.

1405
01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:05.379
but if I could send you
a few things.

1406
01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:07.381
your efficiency
would be an asset

1407
01:05:07.555 --> 01:05:10.167
and it would serve your cause.

1408
01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:12.169
Yeah. of course.

1409
01:05:12.343 --> 01:05:13.866
Yeah. absolutely.

1410
01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.434
Fantastic. I will send you
the documents.

1411
01:05:16.608 --> 01:05:19.263
Okay. awesome!
Thank you. Marina.

1412
01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:37.020
Oh no!

1413
01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:39.283
The fitting. Mom. the fitting!

I'm so sorry!

1415
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:43.374
Honey. it's okay.

1416
01:05:43.548 --> 01:05:45.942
You looked so tired.
I didn't want to wake you.

1417
01:05:46.116 --> 01:05:48.205
Besides. you will get
to see it at the wedding!

1418
01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:49.815
Yeah. but I wanted to be there.

1419
01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:52.252
It's an important part
of the process!

1420
01:05:52.426 --> 01:05:54.211
It's okay.

1421
01:05:54.385 --> 01:05:56.561
Seriously. all good!

1422
01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:00.043
Do you have another wedding?

1423
01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:01.131
Just kidding.

1424
01:06:01.305 --> 01:06:02.349
[laughter]

1425
01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:16.494
Alright. thanks a lot everyone.

1426
01:06:16.668 --> 01:06:18.235
I'll get that out
to you right away.

1427
01:06:18.409 --> 01:06:19.453
Okay. bye.

1428
01:06:26.417 --> 01:06:27.984
How's it going?

1429
01:06:29.376 --> 01:06:30.682
I'm upset with myself.

1430
01:06:30.856 --> 01:06:32.336
I missed my mom's
fitting this morning

1431
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:34.468
because of this all
this last minute work.

1432
01:06:34.642 --> 01:06:36.253
I'm so sorry.

1433
01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:39.386
I can't believe
this is almost over.

1434
01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:40.605
Well it doesn't have to be.

1435
01:06:40.779 --> 01:06:42.476
What do you mean?

1436
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:45.349
We've got to acknowledge
that something happened here.

1437
01:06:45.523 --> 01:06:47.090
Something?

1438
01:06:47.264 --> 01:06:50.484
You said it yourself last night.
something special.

1439
01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:53.052
You said that creating
this has made you feel

1440
01:06:53.226 --> 01:06:55.098
like you were in a dream
you couldn't wake up from.

1441
01:06:55.272 --> 01:06:56.925
So why wake up?

1442
01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.189
Well. because I have
to get back to my life.

1443
01:06:59.363 --> 01:07:00.625
Yeah. but you were
on that path before.

1444
01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:02.322
Why not try it again?

1445
01:07:02.496 --> 01:07:04.324
Well. that's a nice thought.

1446
01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:07.414
But I chose a different path.

1447
01:07:07.588 --> 01:07:09.547
A great path.

1448
01:07:09.721 --> 01:07:12.028
So I've got to stick with it.

1449
01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:13.681
Okay.

1450
01:07:13.855 --> 01:07:16.467
I just really like
collaborating with you.

1451
01:07:16.641 --> 01:07:17.946
I really believe in you.

1452
01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:19.905
I really believe in you. too.

1453
01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:22.647
I couldn't have done
all of this without you.

1454
01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:26.390
Are you going to be able to make
the rehearsal dinner tonight?

1455
01:07:26.564 --> 01:07:28.609
I'll be busy prepping.

1456
01:07:28.783 --> 01:07:31.656
But hey. if I get a break.

1457
01:07:31.830 --> 01:07:34.050
maybe I can make dessert.

1458
01:07:35.312 --> 01:07:37.836
[phone vibrating]

1459
01:07:40.795 --> 01:07:42.145
Hi. Gordon?

1460
01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:45.365
You're where?

1461
01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:47.846
Okay. guess I'll see you soon.

1462
01:07:50.196 --> 01:07:53.286
That was Gordon.
he's in Meadowville.

1463
01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.288
He just got in.

1464
01:07:55.462 --> 01:07:58.291
I guess he's going to
make the wedding after all.

1465
01:07:59.771 --> 01:08:01.077
That's my cue.

1466
01:08:02.295 --> 01:08:03.514
Time to cater.

1467
01:08:20.835 --> 01:08:22.489
-Hey you.
-Hey.

1468
01:08:22.663 --> 01:08:23.534
Surprise!

1469
01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:25.057
Yeah...

1470
01:08:25.231 --> 01:08:26.189
I got these for
the wedding planner!

1471
01:08:26.363 --> 01:08:28.147
Thank you.

1472
01:08:28.321 --> 01:08:30.062
This is a surprise.

1473
01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:31.716
I could tell it
meant a lot to you.

1474
01:08:31.890 --> 01:08:33.544
so I worked it out.

1475
01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:37.243
You did all this?

1476
01:08:37.417 --> 01:08:40.116
Yeah. well with a little help.

1477
01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:42.988
The concept is
A Midsummer Night's Dream.

1478
01:08:43.162 --> 01:08:44.511
You did all this decorating?

1479
01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:46.078
Yeah.

1480
01:08:46.252 --> 01:08:48.080
It was just a
plain old barn before.

1481
01:08:48.254 --> 01:08:50.126
Who are you and
what have you done

1482
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:51.475
with my girlfriend?

1483
01:08:53.607 --> 01:08:55.261
We should probably
head back to the house

1484
01:08:55.435 --> 01:08:57.742
if we're going to get ready
for the rehearsal dinner.

1485
01:09:02.486 --> 01:09:07.578
And by the time they had
switched seats three times.

1486
01:09:07.752 --> 01:09:11.277
I knew I was sitting next
to a very special lady.

1487
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:14.106
And if they dared asked me to
move again. it wasn't happening.

1488
01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.064
I was leaving and I was
taking Bonnie with me.

1489
01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:17.414
Who are you looking for?

1490
01:09:17.588 --> 01:09:19.024
Your caterer-carpenter person?

1491
01:09:19.198 --> 01:09:20.156
No.

1492
01:09:21.505 --> 01:09:22.897
He's prepping for the wedding.

1493
01:09:23.071 --> 01:09:24.638
so I don't know
if he's gonna make it.

1494
01:09:24.812 --> 01:09:26.466
That's too bad.

1495
01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.033
So what's up with you
and Gordon?

1496
01:09:28.207 --> 01:09:29.513
I don't know...

1497
01:09:29.687 --> 01:09:30.992
I was surprised
he even showed up.

1498
01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.299
Good surprised?

1499
01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:35.780
Or maybe not...

1500
01:09:35.954 --> 01:09:39.827
If you find love. rush to it.

1501
01:09:41.394 --> 01:09:42.700
Head on!

1502
01:09:42.874 --> 01:09:44.223
Right now.

1503
01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:46.617
I love you. Bonnie.

1504
01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:47.531
I love you too.

1505
01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:49.097
Cheers.

1506
01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:50.360
Cheers!

1507
01:09:58.933 --> 01:10:00.674
So what's going on?

1508
01:10:00.848 --> 01:10:04.809
I know things have been
strained between us lately.

1509
01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:07.290
And it occurred
to me that. maybe.

1510
01:10:07.464 --> 01:10:09.596
I have been misreading
what you want.

1511
01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.511
I know we had a plan
to hold off.

1512
01:10:11.685 --> 01:10:12.686
but I've was thinking...

1513
01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.862
Maybe it's not about a plan.

1514
01:10:16.299 --> 01:10:20.564
I don't have a ring right now.
but maybe that's apropos?

1515
01:10:20.738 --> 01:10:23.393
Maybe it'll make a good story?

1516
01:10:23.567 --> 01:10:24.742
You know me...

1517
01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:50.724
I'm normally not into
these rituals or conventions.

1518
01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:53.858
but I could be
into them for you.

1519
01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:56.469
Because I don't want
to lose you.

1520
01:10:56.643 --> 01:11:02.040
So. Cassie Mitchell.
will you marry me?

1521
01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:19.579
Will you stand up?

1522
01:11:19.753 --> 01:11:20.711
Please.

1523
01:11:23.888 --> 01:11:27.892
Your proposal had so many
maybes and disclaimers in it.

1524
01:11:28.066 --> 01:11:30.242
I can't marry you Gordon.

1525
01:11:30.416 --> 01:11:33.854
but I don't think that you
want to marry me. either.

1526
01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:36.248
We have both been so good
at coming up with

1527
01:11:36.422 --> 01:11:42.036
all these logical reasons as to
why we haven't gotten here yet.

1528
01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:50.741
Preparing for this wedding
and seeing my mom's big love.

1529
01:11:50.915 --> 01:11:52.743
it's made it really hard
to ignore the fact

1530
01:11:52.917 --> 01:11:57.400
that we haven't been right
together for awhile.

1531
01:11:58.401 --> 01:12:02.448
And I don't think I've even
fully been myself in awhile.

1532
01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:06.452
So... I can't.

1533
01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:08.498
I'm sorry. Gordon.

1534
01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:33.653
I just wanted to say
that I'm happy for you.

1535
01:12:33.827 --> 01:12:36.613
It seems like you've really
found something here.

1536
01:12:36.787 --> 01:12:40.965
Also that barn was
really amazing. Cassie.

1537
01:12:41.139 --> 01:12:43.707
I'm sorry I was so
dismissive this afternoon.

1538
01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:45.143
and before that.

1539
01:12:45.317 --> 01:12:48.102
Thank you Gordon.
that means a lot.

1540
01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:51.628
Drive safe.

1541
01:12:57.111 --> 01:12:59.026
[car starting]

1542
01:13:33.147 --> 01:13:34.801
-Hey. Cassie.
-Hey.

1543
01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:37.674
Came to check on the catering
and the caterer

1544
01:13:40.024 --> 01:13:41.678
I'm gonna take a little break.

1545
01:13:41.852 --> 01:13:43.114
Okay.

1546
01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:47.945
Hello.

1547
01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:49.120
Hey.

1548
01:13:50.077 --> 01:13:52.384
You look like you're in
a really good mood.

1549
01:13:52.558 --> 01:13:55.169
Yeah. surprisingly I am.

1550
01:13:56.693 --> 01:13:58.651
You want to maybe take a break?

1551
01:13:58.825 --> 01:14:01.045
Get some cake from
the rehearsal dinner?

1552
01:14:01.219 --> 01:14:02.699
Clear the cobwebs?

1553
01:14:02.873 --> 01:14:04.309
No. I already went.

1554
01:14:04.483 --> 01:14:06.572
Oh. that's weird.
I didn't see you there.

1555
01:14:06.746 --> 01:14:08.966
I saw you.

1556
01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.534
What's going on. what's wrong?

1557
01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:14.885
I'm just concentrating
on my work.

1558
01:14:15.059 --> 01:14:16.713
You let me know if you need
anything

1559
01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:18.715
as far as the catering goes.

1560
01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:36.428
Hey.

1561
01:14:36.602 --> 01:14:37.734
What's going on?

1562
01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:39.910
Oh nothing.

1563
01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.479
Did something happen
with Cassie?

1564
01:14:43.653 --> 01:14:44.697
I don't know.

1565
01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:49.833
I don't think anything
really ever happened.

1566
01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:54.968
She's got a boyfriend.
No. a fiancé.

1567
01:14:55.142 --> 01:14:58.058
So nothing's going to happen.

1568
01:14:58.232 --> 01:15:00.365
You've been different this week.

1569
01:15:00.539 --> 01:15:03.107
I saw you brought out
the old books.

1570
01:15:03.281 --> 01:15:05.065
It was kind of exciting.

1571
01:15:05.239 --> 01:15:06.937
I was hoping you were back.

1572
01:15:07.111 --> 01:15:08.460
What do you mean. back?

1573
01:15:08.634 --> 01:15:09.983
You're my brother. Kyle.
and I love you.

1574
01:15:10.157 --> 01:15:12.116
But this place has
been a time capsule

1575
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:14.640
of your heartbreak
for three years.

1576
01:15:15.641 --> 01:15:17.338
I want better for you.

1577
01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:18.601
You're going to have to
put yourself back out there.

1578
01:15:18.775 --> 01:15:21.125
I did. and it didn't work.

1579
01:15:21.299 --> 01:15:22.779
You told her how you feel?

1580
01:15:22.953 --> 01:15:23.997
Not exactly.

1581
01:15:24.171 --> 01:15:25.390
You're killing me. man.

1582
01:15:25.564 --> 01:15:27.435
Listen. I only know what I know.

1583
01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:30.134
But I definitely sensed
the mutual chemistry there.

1584
01:15:30.308 --> 01:15:31.657
And even if it comes to nothing.

1585
01:15:31.831 --> 01:15:33.746
at least you had
the feelings again.

1586
01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.400
That's something. right?

1587
01:15:35.574 --> 01:15:36.967
I think we should
call it for tonight.

1588
01:15:37.141 --> 01:15:39.622
I'll see you bright and early.

1589
01:15:41.275 --> 01:15:42.276
Thanks.

1590
01:15:56.813 --> 01:15:57.596
You made it!

1591
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:58.815
Hey!

1592
01:16:04.647 --> 01:16:06.170
So you got that
playlist ready to go?

1593
01:16:06.344 --> 01:16:09.652
I got you. girl. I got you!

1594
01:16:09.826 --> 01:16:11.828
Where's your
caterer-carpenter person?

1595
01:16:12.002 --> 01:16:13.438
Oh. he'll be around.

1596
01:16:13.612 --> 01:16:14.918
I'm sure he'll bust
a few moves for you.

1597
01:16:15.092 --> 01:16:17.007
Oh. can't wait.

1598
01:16:17.181 --> 01:16:19.792
-What's this do?
-Hey. stop it.

1599
01:16:21.925 --> 01:16:23.666
Maybe on the back wall.

1600
01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.102
[phone vibrating]

1601
01:16:26.233 --> 01:16:27.670
Hey Henry?

1602
01:16:30.716 --> 01:16:31.761
I'll be right there.

1603
01:16:31.935 --> 01:16:33.284
What's the problem?

1604
01:16:33.458 --> 01:16:34.677
She came straight
from the hairdresser.

1605
01:16:34.851 --> 01:16:36.287
She's in your room.

1606
01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:42.554
[door knocking]

1607
01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:44.164
Hey mom. can I come in?

1608
01:16:44.338 --> 01:16:46.166
Please come in.

1609
01:16:53.652 --> 01:16:54.958
I am sorry.

1610
01:16:55.132 --> 01:16:57.569
I just had to hide out
for a minute

1611
01:16:57.743 --> 01:17:00.441
in the one room
that hasn't changed.

1612
01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:02.443
That's okay.

1613
01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:03.662
What's going on?

1614
01:17:04.707 --> 01:17:06.665
I can't do it.

1615
01:17:06.839 --> 01:17:09.494
I can't marry Henry.

1616
01:17:09.668 --> 01:17:11.757
Why. what happened?

1617
01:17:11.931 --> 01:17:14.238
I went to pick up
his shoes today

1618
01:17:14.412 --> 01:17:18.721
and the clerk asked me
what size shoe he wore.

1619
01:17:18.895 --> 01:17:20.200
And I didn't know!

1620
01:17:20.374 --> 01:17:21.767
Because I don't.

1621
01:17:21.941 --> 01:17:24.465
I've only known him
for six months.

1622
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.250
What am I doing?

1623
01:17:26.424 --> 01:17:29.209
I have to admit that
at the beginning.

1624
01:17:29.383 --> 01:17:32.778
I was a little bit skeptical.

1625
01:17:32.952 --> 01:17:34.998
But you two are perfect.

1626
01:17:35.172 --> 01:17:40.960
He is crazy about you
and you're crazy about him.

1627
01:17:41.134 --> 01:17:44.050
Do you think maybe
the whole wedding whirlwind

1628
01:17:44.224 --> 01:17:45.922
got you spooked?

1629
01:17:46.096 --> 01:17:47.271
Probably.

1630
01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:50.753
You know. I look at you

1631
01:17:50.927 --> 01:17:53.625
and you are so careful
with your choices.

1632
01:17:53.799 --> 01:17:55.671
That is the adult way to be.

1633
01:17:55.845 --> 01:17:57.237
Like you and Gordon.

1634
01:17:57.411 --> 01:18:00.676
Well. Gordon and I
broke up last night.

1635
01:18:01.764 --> 01:18:04.244
I am so sorry.

1636
01:18:04.418 --> 01:18:07.247
See. that is another
bad sign for today.

1637
01:18:07.421 --> 01:18:09.293
No. that is a good sign.

1638
01:18:10.424 --> 01:18:12.209
I feel kind of free.

1639
01:18:12.383 --> 01:18:13.819
Like I don't know
what's going to happen next

1640
01:18:13.993 --> 01:18:16.866
and for the first time.
that's exciting!

1641
01:18:19.956 --> 01:18:21.958
Can I show you something?

1642
01:18:22.132 --> 01:18:24.830
Yeah. I would love that.

1643
01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.716
This is gorgeous.

1644
01:18:40.890 --> 01:18:42.892
It's A Midsummer Night's Dream!

1645
01:18:43.066 --> 01:18:44.937
I was inspired by you guys.

1646
01:18:45.111 --> 01:18:46.634
By the way you met.

1647
01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:50.029
your love. your shared passion.

1648
01:18:50.203 --> 01:18:52.162
I just thought that
maybe if you saw it.

1649
01:18:52.336 --> 01:18:54.164
it would remind you.

1650
01:18:54.338 --> 01:18:56.166
But that being said.

1651
01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:58.690
if you don't want to get
married. you don't have to.

1652
01:18:58.864 --> 01:19:00.823
Everyone can just go home.

1653
01:19:00.997 --> 01:19:03.042
No. I want to marry Henry.

1654
01:19:03.216 --> 01:19:04.522
I love him.

1655
01:19:05.828 --> 01:19:08.178
This is wonderful!

1656
01:19:08.352 --> 01:19:11.050
You are such a
wonderful daughter.

1657
01:19:11.224 --> 01:19:12.791
Let me show you around.

1658
01:19:16.534 --> 01:19:18.623
You look beautiful. Mom.

1659
01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:20.625
So do you. honey.

1660
01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:22.801
Is everything okay?

1661
01:19:22.975 --> 01:19:25.804
Yeah. I'm just
going to miss this.

1662
01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:29.677
And Kyle...

1663
01:19:29.852 --> 01:19:31.767
Does he know how you feel?

1664
01:19:33.507 --> 01:19:35.379
I don't know.

1665
01:19:35.553 --> 01:19:37.207
I was going to tell him
last night.

1666
01:19:37.381 --> 01:19:39.905
but something changed.

1667
01:19:40.079 --> 01:19:42.386
Does he know you're
not with Gordon anymore?

1668
01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.042
No. but I don't want
to complicate things.

1669
01:19:46.216 --> 01:19:47.565
Besides. it's your wedding day.

1670
01:19:47.739 --> 01:19:50.263
so I'm going to
be focusing on you.

1671
01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:54.659
Let's go get you married before
you change your mind again!

1672
01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:56.530
Go. let's do it!

1673
01:20:02.188 --> 01:20:05.801
[applause]

1674
01:20:22.165 --> 01:20:23.557
So what do you think?

1675
01:20:24.907 --> 01:20:27.387
It's so glorious.
so imaginative!

1676
01:20:27.561 --> 01:20:28.954
How did you come up with this?

1677
01:20:29.128 --> 01:20:30.869
I was inspired by you guys.

1678
01:20:31.043 --> 01:20:32.436
How you met.

1679
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:34.394
I feel so honored.

1680
01:20:34.568 --> 01:20:37.006
I'm glad you're here. Henry.

1681
01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.443
I'm really happy that you
and my mom fell in love.

1682
01:20:39.617 --> 01:20:41.010
Welcome to the family.

1683
01:20:41.184 --> 01:20:42.707
Thank you.

1684
01:20:42.881 --> 01:20:44.578
[glasses clink]
Cheers.

1685
01:20:47.103 --> 01:20:48.756
Everyone loved the food.

1686
01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:50.149
A woman from the Cozy-Lux Inn

1687
01:20:50.323 --> 01:20:51.324
just asked me if
you'd be interested

1688
01:20:51.498 --> 01:20:52.935
in catering events for them.

1689
01:20:53.109 --> 01:20:54.632
Someone else just asked me

1690
01:20:54.806 --> 01:20:57.200
if you'd be interested
in servicing Chicago.

1691
01:20:57.374 --> 01:20:59.245
This could be a big deal.

1692
01:20:59.419 --> 01:21:03.597
Yeah well. I'm just really happy
for Bonnie and Henry.

1693
01:21:05.121 --> 01:21:06.426
You really did it. man.

1694
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.298
You should be proud.

1695
01:21:08.472 --> 01:21:11.910
I couldn't have done it
without you bro. seriously.

1696
01:21:12.084 --> 01:21:13.346
And Cassie.

1697
01:21:16.349 --> 01:21:17.133
Cheers bud.

1698
01:21:17.307 --> 01:21:18.221
Cheers.

1699

[phone vibrating]

1700
01:21:25.968 --> 01:21:26.882
Hi Marina.

1701
01:21:27.056 --> 01:21:28.231
Hi Cassie.

1702
01:21:28.405 --> 01:21:30.973
I hope this isn't a bad time.

1703
01:21:31.147 --> 01:21:32.975
I just wanted to call
and let you know

1704
01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:35.760
that I'm putting in paperwork
to fast track your promotion.

1705
01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:37.457
Really great work
these last few days.

1706
01:21:37.631 --> 01:21:38.763
Thank you.

1707
01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:40.721
That's great news!

1708
01:21:40.896 --> 01:21:41.897
Okay. buh-bye.

1709
01:21:48.468 --> 01:21:49.513
Hey.

1710
01:21:50.427 --> 01:21:51.341
Hey.

1711
01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:54.257
Wow. looks like it worked out.

1712
01:21:54.431 --> 01:21:55.867
It did.

1713
01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:58.391
I really couldn't
have done it without you.

1714
01:21:58.565 --> 01:22:01.525
And the ceremony in the woods
was just beautiful.

1715
01:22:01.699 --> 01:22:03.005
They look so happy.

1716
01:22:03.179 --> 01:22:04.136
Yeah.

1717
01:22:06.051 --> 01:22:07.879
Where's Gordon?

1718
01:22:08.053 --> 01:22:11.361
He had a work emergency
in Chicago.

1719
01:22:13.145 --> 01:22:16.061
Do you think he would
mind if we danced?

1720
01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:17.715
Nope.

1721
01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:34.384
Your food was a hit.

1722
01:22:37.691 --> 01:22:39.519
I owe that all to you.

1723
01:22:40.738 --> 01:22:43.349
I guess I did need
that little push.

1724
01:22:43.523 --> 01:22:45.264
You know. I could be persuaded

1725
01:22:45.438 --> 01:22:48.050
to add one or two of
those items to the menu.

1726
01:22:48.224 --> 01:22:49.703
Maybe as specials?

1727
01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:54.404
I got the promotion. by the way.

1728
01:22:54.578 --> 01:22:57.189
Cassie that's amazing.
congratulations.

1729
01:22:59.583 --> 01:23:02.325
You'll be great no matter
what you do.

1730
01:23:04.588 --> 01:23:06.372
When do you leave?

1731
01:23:08.374 --> 01:23:09.419
Tomorrow.

1732
01:23:34.574 --> 01:23:35.706
Bye. honey.

1733
01:23:51.678 --> 01:23:53.028
Hey there. Kyle.

1734
01:23:53.202 --> 01:23:55.291
Hey. Henry.

1735
01:23:55.465 --> 01:23:57.249
I just wanted to stop by

1736
01:23:57.423 --> 01:23:59.556
and thank you again for
your delicious food last night.

1737
01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:03.299
So. I guess Cassie's on her
way out of town?

1738
01:24:03.473 --> 01:24:05.170
That she is.

1739
01:24:05.344 --> 01:24:07.564
I just hope she can
get some rest.

1740
01:24:07.738 --> 01:24:09.609
What with planning a wedding

1741
01:24:09.783 --> 01:24:11.959
and going through a
break up at the same time.

1742
01:24:12.134 --> 01:24:13.178
What?

1743
01:24:13.352 --> 01:24:14.658
Oh. she and that Gordon fellow

1744
01:24:14.832 --> 01:24:16.094
broke up a day
before the wedding.

1745
01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:17.182
You didn't know?

1746
01:24:17.356 --> 01:24:18.879
No!

1747
01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:21.491
I think it's a good thing.

1748
01:24:21.665 --> 01:24:23.623
They didn't seem like a match.

1749
01:24:23.797 --> 01:24:25.103
I gotta go.

1750
01:24:26.713 --> 01:24:28.019
Thank you!

1751
01:24:28.193 --> 01:24:29.368
She has about
20 minutes on you.

1752
01:24:51.695 --> 01:24:53.305
Excuse me...

1753
01:24:53.479 --> 01:24:55.960
Do you mind if I sit here?

1754
01:24:56.134 --> 01:24:58.919
Kyle? What are you doing here?

1755
01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:00.312
I came to find you.

1756
01:25:00.486 --> 01:25:02.662
You're headed in
the wrong direction.

1757
01:25:02.836 --> 01:25:04.011
What do you mean?

1758
01:25:04.186 --> 01:25:05.230
On the highway?

1759
01:25:05.404 --> 01:25:07.058
Yeah. just in general.

1760
01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:10.714
Look. I made a mistake
and I owe you an apology.

1761
01:25:11.932 --> 01:25:13.325
I'm so sorry for
the other night.

1762
01:25:13.499 --> 01:25:15.240
I thought you and Gordon
had gotten engaged.

1763
01:25:15.414 --> 01:25:18.635
and I acted like a child.

1764
01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:20.463
The truth is.

1765
01:25:20.637 --> 01:25:22.421
I came over with the
intention of telling you

1766
01:25:22.595 --> 01:25:26.077
how I really feel and
I thought I was too late.

1767
01:25:26.251 --> 01:25:27.687
How you really feel?

1768
01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:29.124
You said this week
has felt like a dream

1769
01:25:29.298 --> 01:25:31.474
you didn't want to wake up from.

1770
01:25:31.648 --> 01:25:33.606
Well. I feel it too.

1771
01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:35.217
About being with you.

1772
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:38.481
