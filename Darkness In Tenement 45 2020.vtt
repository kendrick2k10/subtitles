3
00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:12.358
(ominous beat music)

4
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.040
- [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.830
President Harry S. Truman.

6
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.874
- [Truman] My fellow Americans.

7
00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:28.986
I want to talk to you plainly tonight.

8
00:00:28.986 --> 00:00:33.380
We are trying to prevent
a third world war.

9
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.463
(ominous beat music)

10
00:01:29.115 --> 00:01:32.198
(ominous beat music)

11
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.150
- You catch one?

12
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.487
Go hand it off to Joanna!

13
00:02:38.674 --> 00:02:42.007
(faint saxophone music)

14
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.047
(girl yelping)

15
00:02:47.047 --> 00:02:48.893
- It's just a bug. Isabel!

16
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.550
- Hey. c'mon now.

17
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.503
- [Girl] Sorry.

18
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.683
- Rascal.

19
00:03:02.764 --> 00:03:05.514
(sinister music)

20
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.083
- Whoa. there.

21
00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.870
Slow missy.

22
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.800
- Yes. Mama Shan.

23
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.670
- I've told you before. Shannon is fine!

24
00:03:18.017 --> 00:03:21.743
(faint saxophone music)

25
00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:24.243
(boy huffing)

26
00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.406
- [Man] 10. 11. 12. 13.

27
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.908
13 counts of green beans.

28
00:03:30.908 --> 00:03:32.957
- [Woman] Okay.

29
00:03:32.957 --> 00:03:34.393
- And one bag of flower.

30
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.420
- [Woman] One bag. that can't be right.

31
00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:49.253
- Joanna. look. look!
(Joanna shushing)

32
00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:55.419
(pleasant jazz music)

33
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.120
- Even if we fill that whole jar.

34
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.120
it's not gonna last us more than a week.

35
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.640
Who's to say it's even edible?

36
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.070
- We could go to the moldy food.

37
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.313
that would give us about a week
if we eat around the edges.

38
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.083
- Martha.

39
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.203
we have no choice.

40
00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:35.925
(ominous music)

41
00:04:38.074 --> 00:04:40.907
(Joanna exhaling)

42
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.743
- I'm sorry.

43
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.863
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.800
Did we upset my little niece?

45
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.150
I promise I will not
mention such things again.

46
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.200
- Thank you. Aunt Martha.

47
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.020
- Here.

48
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.073
Why don't you go upstairs
and we'll finish up here?

49
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.863
We must be mindful.

50
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.100
That child is not well.

51
00:05:21.014 --> 00:05:22.764
- The weeks inside are not helping.

52
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.323
- Shall we continue?

53
00:05:50.006 --> 00:05:51.596
- Well.

54
00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:52.929
let's get to it.

55
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.768
Shannon.

56
00:05:55.768 --> 00:05:58.220
what have you added to today's roster?

57
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.450
- Your boy cut his knee again
on something in that closet.

58
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.950
I warned him the last time

59
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.227
to stop messing in that closet. I did!

60
00:06:04.227 --> 00:06:06.060
But he never listens.

61
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.930
He must've hit a loose nail or something.

62
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.000
Cost us...

63
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.400
one bandage.

64
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.333
one cotton ball and about
two ounces of alcohol.

65
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.750
- Very well then. I
will speak with Tomás.

66
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.053
- He don't listen!

67
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.310
- Horen.

68
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.920
I saw you working earlier.

69
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.550
- Oh yeah. yeah.

70
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.710
See. I noticed some
cracks on those stairs.

71
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.510
Went and plastered the thing right up.

72
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.343
- [Felix] Very good.

73
00:06:33.343 --> 00:06:35.270
- Oh. Felix. you'll love this.

74
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.530
I noticed that my spit

75
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.670
actually stretched the stuff out a little.

76
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.530
made it last a little longer.

77
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.740
So I only used about a
dime's worth of the stuff.

78
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.573
How's that?

79
00:06:44.573 --> 00:06:46.090
- That's very good. Horen.

80
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.940
Very economical.

81
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.760
- That's disgusting.

82
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.390
- That was it.

83
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.783
No other repairs.

84
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.430
- My girls tell me that we're down

85
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.040
to our last bottle of bleach.

86
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.063
121 ounces remaining.

87
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.030
(floor creaking)

88
00:07:08.048 --> 00:07:09.670
Martha?

89
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.503
Go on.

90
00:07:12.152 --> 00:07:14.720
(Martha sighing)

91
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.580
- I'm afraid we're low on food.

92
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.220
- What?

93
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.540
How low?

94
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.583
- Well. if we continue as we have.

95
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.810
about a month of supplies left.

96
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:28.890
- [Shannon] A month?

97
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.010
- [Martha] And we will
have to further ration

98
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.800
our current supply in
order to have that much.

99
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.583
- But there's hardly enough
to go around as it is!

100
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.483
Have we heard anything from the outside?

101
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:46.940
Perhaps the quarantine has ended

102
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.790
and people have returned to their homes.

103
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.320
- And perhaps the Commies will
spare you for your stupidity.

104
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.373
- Come now. please.

105
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.340
I'm afraid the outside has been silent.

106
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.973
(ominous music)

107
00:08:01.973 --> 00:08:04.657
It isn't practical to
depend on the unknown.

108
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.120
- What if Horen sought help?

109
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.503
From the outside?

110
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.860
- You sure have some nerve.

111
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.830
Trying to make me leave my own building.

112
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.740
For Christ sake!
- You heard her!

113
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.780
(Felix and Shannon muffled arguing)

114
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:18.613
Are you kidding?

115
00:08:18.613 --> 00:08:20.626
I'm not gonna get killed!

116
00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:21.459
(pencil cracking)

117
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:22.400
- [Felix] You know this
place better than anyone.

118
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.840
- [Horen] You think I'm
gonna let you stay in

119
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.017
this building by yourself?
- What can be done?

120
00:08:26.017 --> 00:08:28.293
- You are just ridiculous!
- Please. stop!

121
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.080
- I'm afraid we must take action.

122
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.763
Think I'm gonna sit around and
watch my children go hungry?

123
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:40.960
I think Shannon is right.

124
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.710
We have to explore the outside.

125
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.320
- [Martha] But we already
decided that it's best

126
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.470
to stay inside until we heard news.

127
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.580
- Yeah. we don't even know
if the Commies dropped it.

128
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.040
I can't leave my own building.

129
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.490
- And you shouldn't. okay?

130
00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.340
You know this place better
than anybody. you should stay.

131
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.403
I will go and I will go alone.

132
00:09:05.575 --> 00:09:07.230
(ominous music)

133
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.420
- You?

134
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.640
No. no. no. we can't have you go out.

135
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.908
You could get hurt!

136
00:09:11.908 --> 00:09:13.450
- Well. I'll wear a protective suit

137
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.471
and we'll pray for the best.

138
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:18.138
(ominous music)

139
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.050
- Well. so much as it

140
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.210
pains me to say.

141
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.470
I believe that Felix is right.

142
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.893
Without an excursion.

143
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.483
we may not survive.

144
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.603
And he is the most well equipped.

145
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.009
I propose a vote.

146
00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:48.070
- No.

147
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.903
No votes.

148
00:09:48.903 --> 00:09:50.300
Everyone cool it!

149
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.340
Come on. Felix. think about
this biological disease crap.

150
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.350
The president just doesn't

151
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.260
evacuate New York City for nothing.

152
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.020
- Well. I'm afraid we have
no other options. Horen.

153
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.063
- But your kids!

154
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.143
- My kids?

155
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.480
Tell me. what good is it for me to stay

156
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.757
if only to watch them wither away. eh?

157
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.030
Now a vote has commenced.

158
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.740
All those in favor?

159
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.645
Yea.

160
00:10:18.645 --> 00:10:19.478
- Yea.
- Yea.

161
00:10:19.478 --> 00:10:20.360
- Yea.

162
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.560
- [Felix] Those opposed?

163
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.553
- Nay.

164
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.793
- Then it's decided.

165
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.390
I will leave in the morning.

166
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.913
- Your courage will save us all.

167
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:38.670
- My children will need you. Martha.

168
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.060
- And I will be there.

169
00:10:43.107 --> 00:10:45.230
Horen. perhaps you could grab the children

170
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.173
before the meal starts to spoil?

171
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.693
- As if that dog food was ever any good.

172
00:10:56.362 --> 00:10:59.036
Hey kids. c'mon down for dinner.

173
00:10:59.036 --> 00:11:01.703
(door creaking)

174
00:11:04.103 --> 00:11:05.230
- What is it?

175
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.070
- It's not good.

176
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.020
- That's it?

177
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.193
- Rationing. Shannon.

178
00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.363
- Ridiculous.

179
00:11:59.401 --> 00:12:00.651
- There you go.

180
00:12:02.146 --> 00:12:03.229
There you go.

181
00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:14.842
Ay yi yi.

182
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.410
Okay. children.

183
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.810
we need to discuss a new
plan for everyone here.

184
00:12:22.487 --> 00:12:23.437
Would that be okay?

185
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.973
You see. this biological
threat from last month.

186
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.160
the thing that may be outside.

187
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.740
it doesn't seem to be improving.

188
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.653
But no one is to fret. as we
have come up with a solution.

189
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.930
I will be taking a short leave

190
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.370
to find us some more fresh food. okay?

191
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.203
- You're leaving?

192
00:12:47.203 --> 00:12:48.930
- But. Papa. why do you have to leave?

193
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.315
- Yeah. make Horen go.

194
00:12:50.315 --> 00:12:51.350
- Again?

195
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.253
- It's his building!

196
00:12:53.253 --> 00:12:56.670
(Felix speaking Spanish)

197
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.773
- Yes. Papa.

198
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.728
- Do you really have to go?

199
00:13:06.728 --> 00:13:09.395
(ominous music)

200
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.463
- I'm afraid so.

201
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.720
But Martha and your brother will see

202
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.270
that you are all taken care
of when I'm away. okay?

203
00:13:27.436 --> 00:13:28.633
(Isabel crying)

204
00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:30.316
- No. Papa!

205
00:13:30.316 --> 00:13:31.149
No!

206
00:13:31.149 --> 00:13:35.149
(daughters shouting in Spanish)

207
00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:37.712
- No.

208
00:13:37.712 --> 00:13:39.301
He's going for everyone.

209
00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:40.294
It's okay.

210
00:13:40.294 --> 00:13:42.090
(Isabel speaking Spanish)
Don't yell. it's okay!

211
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.413
- Please. please!

212
00:13:43.413 --> 00:13:44.603
- Jesus.

213
00:13:44.603 --> 00:13:46.030
- Mira. mira. mira. crying and yelling

214
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.880
is not going to solve anything. okay?

215
00:13:50.803 --> 00:13:53.560
We have to do what's
best for everyone here.

216
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.510
It's only going to be for a short time.

217
00:13:56.709 --> 00:13:59.376
(Isabel crying)

218
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.680
(match sizzling)

219
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.993
- Okay. children.

220
00:14:08.371 --> 00:14:09.204
eat up.

221
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.880
- Yes. Mrs. Martha.
- Yes. Mrs. Martha.

222
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.943
- We must give Felix time to prepare.

223
00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.702
(ominous music)

224
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.170
- You can't just leave us all here!

225
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.199
What are we supposed to do?

226
00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:40.230
(Felix speaking Spanish)

227
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.333
- Grab me another rag.

- [Isabel] No.

231
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:51.840
No.

232
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.720
No. Papa.

233

(Felix speaking Spanish)

234
00:14:54.553 --> 00:14:57.553
(smooth jazz music)

235
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.673
- What?

236
00:15:03.483 --> 00:15:06.913

♪ Those angel eyes ♪

247
00:16:01.523 --> 00:16:03.523
- Where did everyone go?

248
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.060
- I asked them to give us some time.

249
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:09.923
Come. sit.

250
00:16:11.423 --> 00:16:12.256
- Okay.

251
00:16:21.468 --> 00:16:24.790
- It's a scary thing what's happening. no?

252
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:25.623
- Yeah.

253
00:16:27.402 --> 00:16:29.403
- Many a strong man must face fear.

254
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.070
What's important is not that you see it

255
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.990
but that you stand up to it.

256
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.603
Do you understand what I'm saying?

257
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.320
- Yeah.

258
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.153
Yeah.

259
00:16:45.665 --> 00:16:46.498
- Tomás.

260
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.253
Things will get difficult.

261
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.220
They may even get scary.

262
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.710
But a true leader must guide and protect

263
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.050
while still concerning
themselves with the greater good.

264
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.483
Of everyone's greater good.

265
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.800
I'm trusting you to listen
to your sister's needs

266
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800
and to protect them.

267
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.223
Can you do that?

268
00:17:13.806 --> 00:17:15.890
I need you to answer me.

269
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.493
- Yes. okay. yes.

270
00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:24.139
- Good.

271
00:17:24.139 --> 00:17:24.972
Good.

272
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.660
- May I use the toilet?

273
00:17:40.257 --> 00:17:41.174
- Go ahead.

274
00:17:51.099 --> 00:17:54.016
(machine cranking)

275
00:18:00.242 --> 00:18:03.075
(Rhonda coughing)

276
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.400
- Them adults sure are
dumb sending out Mr. Soto.

277
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.880
- I know.

278
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.960
But Martha thinks it's for the best.

279
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.143
She's usually right
about this sort of thing.

280
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.150
I wish you could've heard what
they said in that meeting.

281
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.680
- Yeah. 'till they catch me listening.

282
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.207
Give them the perfect
excuse for kicking out

283
00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:29.523
one of us foster kids.

284
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.103
- Martha wouldn't do that.

285
00:18:32.103 --> 00:18:33.120
- Pfft.

286
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.893
Half the places I been kicked
out of say the same thing.

287
00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.310
Think he'll really be leaving?

288
00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.123
- I don't think he has a choice.

289
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.040
We're running out of food...

290
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.963
Fast.

291
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.563
They have to do something.

292
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.400
- Yeah. but Mr. Soto?

293
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.233
I mean. without him.

294
00:18:57.233 --> 00:18:59.220
them adults aren't gonna know what to do.

295
00:19:00.394 --> 00:19:02.953
(ominous music)

296
00:19:02.953 --> 00:19:06.453
(Joanna breathing deeply)

297
00:19:10.856 --> 00:19:12.769
You all right?

298
00:19:12.769 --> 00:19:13.602
- Yeah.

299
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.160
It's just something my mom
taught me back upstate.

300
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.063
For my problem.

301
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.460
Deep breaths.

302
00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.020
(eerie music)

303
00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:40.303
- [Felix] Martha.

304
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:44.630
- Don't forget to knock twice

305
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.200
once you're out the foyer.

306
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.800
So we can repair the wood quickly

307
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.960
and double check before passing

308
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.040
any dumpsters or tall buildings.

309
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.873
Those Commies could be hiding anywhere.

310
00:19:58.873 --> 00:19:59.706
- I will.

311
00:20:04.391 --> 00:20:06.974
(gun cranking)

312
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:16.173
- Just be safe.

313
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.543
- Thank you.

314
00:20:26.991 --> 00:20:29.658
(Felix sighing)

315
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.233
Stand. son.

316
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.950
I want you to remember what
we talked about yesterday.

317
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.240
I need you to protect your sisters

318
00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.240
and look after the other children. okay?

319
00:20:44.261 --> 00:20:46.550
Tomás!

320
00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.383
Tell me you're gonna do that.

321
00:20:47.383 --> 00:20:48.253
- Yes. okay.

322
00:20:50.593 --> 00:20:52.093
- I love you. mijo.

323
00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:54.903
I love you.

(somber jazz music)

326
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.460
- May we please have all the children

327
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.573
step back from the door?

328
00:21:19.292 --> 00:21:23.670
Well Felix. there doesn't
seem to be a better time.

329
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.520
- This is true Martha.

330
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.287
I guess it's only proper that
I should say something. eh?

331
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.770
Please. children. friends.

332
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.960
don't look at this as a loss

333
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.520
but instead as an exciting promise!

334
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.070
I'll be back within the week!

335
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.520
And I'll be back with
fresh food. clean linens.

336
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.150
Hey. perhaps some new
toys for the children

337
00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.300
if they are good. okay?

338
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.367
Well. let's get to this. huh?

- He promised no more than a week.

372
00:24:29.857 --> 00:24:33.460
- It's okay. Rhonda. Felix
is coming back. all right?

373
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.493
- Why don't Martha like me?

374
00:24:38.033 --> 00:24:39.133
- It's not you.

375
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:44.510
My aunt can be intense.

376
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.080
but she's just trying to keep us safe.

377
00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.510
Okay?

378
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:49.810
She must like us a little.

379
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.623
Hmm?

380
00:24:53.111 --> 00:24:53.944
Hmm?

381
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:57.268
(Rhonda coughing)

382
00:24:57.268 --> 00:24:58.831
(Walter shushing)

383
00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:00.460
- What did I say about that?

384
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.433
No coughing.

385
00:25:02.782 --> 00:25:03.882
- Is she feeling okay?

386
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.880
- Yeah. she good.

387
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.542
Being inside has got her throat all sore.

388
00:25:09.542 --> 00:25:11.760
(machine clicking)

389
00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.970
- Can I have some sugar bar?

390
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:14.970
- You gonna be good?

391
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:32.290
- Mommy used to love getting me sugar bar.

392
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.940
Did your mommy get sugar bar?

393
00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.220
- I don't really know what that is but no.

394
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:38.610
My mom doesn't really cook.

395
00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.523
- Well then what does she do?

396
00:25:42.445 --> 00:25:44.380
(Joanna chuckling)

397
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.830
- Well when I was younger.
it was just us so.

398
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.340
she'd do just about anything for work.

399
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.930
When I left. she was working in a factory.

400
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.960
- You mean when you got the darkness?

401
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.050
(eerie music)

402
00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:58.590
- Who told you that?

403
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.573
- Martha told all us kids
that you got the darkness.

404
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.233
It's why we gotta give you space.

405
00:26:08.713 --> 00:26:09.740
- Yes.

406
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.325
That's when I got the darkness.

407
00:26:11.325 --> 00:26:14.158
(machine buzzing)

408
00:26:21.601 --> 00:26:22.434
There.

409
00:26:23.305 --> 00:26:24.222
All better.

410
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.050
- So where's your momma now?

411
00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:29.980
- You sure ask a lot of questions.

412
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.170
- [Rhonda] Is she having
a big slumber party too?

413
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.290
- She could be.

414
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:34.290
I don't really know.

415
00:26:35.378 --> 00:26:38.045
(ominous music)

416
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:41.830

Yeah.

432
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.640
- Oh. Joanna.

433
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.323
Just taking some proper precautions.

434
00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:36.883
Just to keep you safe. my dear.

435
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.620

436
00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.267

437
00:28:44.267 --> 00:28:47.477

- [Isolina] We talked
about this already. Isabel.

441
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:12.660
- What if something gets in
the building. like the virus?

442
00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.493
What will we do then?

443
00:29:13.493 --> 00:29:15.090
- Isabel. you need to relax.

444
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:16.880
- Papa said he would
only be gone for a week.

445
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.480
Did he say anything else to you?

446
00:29:22.106 --> 00:29:22.939
Ugh!

Anything there?

533
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.028
- [Horen] Nothing.

534
00:34:54.028 --> 00:34:57.933
And that wallpaper's
been like that for years.

535
00:34:57.933 --> 00:34:59.350
- [Walter] Just go upstairs.

536
00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:02.350
- Coulda just been an
earthquake for all we know.

537
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:05.517
- But we must take proper
precautions. Horen.

538

Let's talk about this later. shall we?

539
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.640
How are the children?

540
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.040
- Good.

541
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.000
Tomás cut his elbow so I
had to use a bandage but--

542
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.640
- Mm-hmm?
- That's it for now.

543
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.180
- Well. very good.

544
00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.013

- Yes. what is it?

546
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.330
- May I speak with you?

547
00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:29.573
Privately.

548
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.940
- Things are very busy right now. Joanna.

549
00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:34.313
Okay. just spit it out.

550
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:36.543
- Okay.

551
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:45.587
I saw something out the
window during the shake.

552
00:35:45.587 --> 00:35:47.016
- What was it. honey?

553
00:35:47.016 --> 00:35:48.630
(Martha shushing)

554
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:49.683
- It was a balloon.

555
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.783
A bright yellow one.

556
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:55.103
- Martha?

557
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:02.210
- With the brightness of that old sun

558
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:06.306
she saw that and much more.

559
00:36:06.306 --> 00:36:08.883
but it was simply a mirage.

560
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.530
- It wasn't a mirage. I'm sure of it.

561
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.983
- [Walter] Where'd you see it?

562
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:17.450
- It floated past.

563
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:19.363
Right before the window got boarded up.

564
00:36:21.026 --> 00:36:21.859
- Oh. Joanna.

565
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.540
Now it's been a long day

566
00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:31.590
and there is no reason for you
to create these stories now.

567
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.653
- Well. shouldn't we at
least ask some questions?

568
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.143
- She needs rest for the darkness.

569
00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.120
- I'm fine.

570
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.420
- Christ. let the girl speak!

571
00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.120
Joanna. honey.

572
00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.193
was that all you saw?

573
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.000
- Well. yeah. but...

574
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.997
I only had a second to look.

575
00:36:49.997 --> 00:36:51.970
- All right. that's enough.

576
00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.300
I'm not gonna let your lies
create chaos in this house.

577
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.040
We have to concentrate on keeping

578
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.480
ourselves safe from the disease.

579
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.020
Do you understand?

580
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.873
Not some non-existent object!

581
00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.120
- Aunt Martha.

582
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.570
- Not another word

583
00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.920
or you'll be without breakfast!

584
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.673
Now go to bed!

585
00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:19.670
And you will continue to help Shannon

586
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.853
and you will do work as I see fit.

587
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:28.410
Now no more talk of this nonsense!

588
00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.623
She is damaged!

589
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:36.760
And I can't believe you
are so simple-minded

590
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.173
to leave that child.

591
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.317
- No. of course not. ma'am.

592
00:37:48.717 --> 00:37:51.634
(thunder rumbling)

593
00:37:55.733 --> 00:37:58.566
(Joanna exhaling)

594
00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:10.361
(eerie music)

595
00:38:12.008 --> 00:38:14.591
(woman crying)

596
00:38:17.676 --> 00:38:20.426
(metal clinking)

597
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.213
(wind howling)

598
00:38:26.808 --> 00:38:29.391
(woman crying)

599
00:38:31.639 --> 00:38:32.472
- Mother?

600
00:38:36.969 --> 00:38:38.473
The doors!

601
00:38:38.473 --> 00:38:41.140
(intense music)

602
00:38:44.734 --> 00:38:47.984
(somber chiming music)

603
00:38:52.297 --> 00:38:55.257
(Joanna whimpering)

604
00:38:55.257 --> 00:38:58.217
(woman screaming)

605
00:38:58.217 --> 00:39:00.825
(intense music)

606
00:39:00.825 --> 00:39:03.575
(Joanna gasping)

607
00:39:04.813 --> 00:39:06.649
No. Mother. stop!

608
00:39:06.649 --> 00:39:09.316
(intense music)

609
00:39:13.582 --> 00:39:18.582
(Joanna gasping)
(thunder rumbling)

610
00:39:34.336 --> 00:39:37.336
(Joanna whimpering)

611
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.117
(thunder rumbling)

612
00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:52.589
(Joanna sighing)

613
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:02.611
(rain trickling)

614
00:40:05.264 --> 00:40:08.356
(Rhonda coughing)

615
00:40:08.356 --> 00:40:11.273
(cricket chirping)

616
00:40:13.023 --> 00:40:15.856
(Rhonda coughing)

617
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.402
- Who's there?

618
00:40:25.402 --> 00:40:28.470
(match sizzling)

619
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:30.357
- Mr. Burton. I was
just looking for some--

620
00:40:30.357 --> 00:40:32.450
- No need to tell me.

621
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.363
You're just taking from the man.

622
00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:38.515
Oh. excuse me. woman.

623
00:40:38.515 --> 00:40:41.265
(Horen laughing)

624
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.403
Besides. I could use the company.

625
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.203
Come on. it's my last one.

626
00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.530
- Martha said that
stuff's just for bad cuts.

627
00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:11.393
- Yeah. well.

628
00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.223
Martha says a lot of things.

629
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.213
That woman's vibrato can slay a cat.

630
00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.045
Or an elephant.

631
00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:24.597
(Heron laughing)

632
00:41:24.597 --> 00:41:25.430
Eh.

633
00:41:26.549 --> 00:41:28.010
I should've known right when she asked

634
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:29.743
for her own set of keys.

635
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:32.873
Sure feel like a real fathead now.

636
00:41:37.274 --> 00:41:40.460
And where does she get this poppycock idea

637
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.640
that some slabs of wood will
keep the Commie disease out?

638
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.360
I can guarantee you the
White House isn't covered

639
00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.443
with planks of crummy wood. ya'know?

640
00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:54.830
- So you won't tell her I was down here?

641
00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.093
- Why would I?

642
00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:01.113
Damn woman changes the
locks in my building?

643
00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.423
Those Reds can take her for all I care.

644
00:42:09.210 --> 00:42:10.463
Why you up anyway?

645
00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:15.203
- Can't sleep.

646
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.043
- Me too.

647
00:42:19.867 --> 00:42:22.067
Can't stop thinking
about that damn balloon.

648
00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:25.990
- You believe her?

649
00:42:27.574 --> 00:42:30.163
- That was the most pep
I've ever seen from you.

650
00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.297
Yeah. I believe her.

651
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:34.913
Guessing you do too?

652
00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:38.837
- Probably the only thing I know is true.

653
00:42:38.837 --> 00:42:40.639
(Horen chuckling)

654
00:42:40.639 --> 00:42:41.943
- That must be nice.

655
00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:46.010
Hey.

656
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:48.910
we'll figure out what's going
on outside. don't you worry.

657
00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:53.303
We just have to work
together and stay safe.

658
00:42:56.189 --> 00:42:57.023
Ya got that?

659
00:42:59.130 --> 00:42:59.963
- Yeah.

660
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.203
Thanks.

661
00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.150
- Hey. you looking for
cookies in there or what?

662
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.850
'Cause I can tell you there ain't any.

663
00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.010
- Oh.

664
00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.100
no.

665
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.553
It was something for my sis.

666
00:43:20.187 --> 00:43:21.640
- Well.

667
00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.923
better go get it then.

668
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.260
I can keep a secret.

669
00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.940
My late wife. Louisa.

670
00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.253
used to get me honey when my throat hurt.

671
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.813
That should be in the middle right.

672
00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:59.370
- Thanks.

673
00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:00.203
- Hurry now.

674
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.263
You don't want Martha to
hear her coughing like that.

675
00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.830
- I wish those adults
listened to you more. sir.

676
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.373
- You and me both. kiddo.

677
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.823
- Thanks.

678
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.130
- You and me both.

679
00:44:30.107 --> 00:44:33.024
(thunder rumbling)

680
00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.243
Well. let's get this over with.

681
00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:53.833
- We cannot take
yesterday's events lightly.

682
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:55.583
(eerie music)

683
00:44:55.583 --> 00:44:57.280
- [Shannon] What do you suggest. Martha?

684
00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.630
- It's time we take action.

685
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.424
Felix has been gone nearly
two weeks by my count.

686
00:45:05.424 --> 00:45:06.932
(ominous music)

687
00:45:06.932 --> 00:45:08.882
- [Horen] Who said that was a bad idea?

688
00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:13.350
- We need to send someone
else out for supplies

689
00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:14.673
and for Felix.

690
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.620
- Someone else?

691
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:17.653
- [Abrahem] Here. here.

692
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.000
- Oh. so are you volunteering to go out

693
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.603
in whatever that is yourself?

694
00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:29.043
- Actually. I was thinking you should.

695
00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.363
- Makes sense.

696
00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.333
- How?

697
00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:35.053
How does any of this make sense?

698
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.880
- Sorry.

699
00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.150
- [Horen] We don't even
know what. if anything.

700
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:39.203
is out there.

701
00:45:39.203 --> 00:45:41.110
- Exactly.

702
00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:44.940
We need someone to investigate
and bring us back information

703
00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.710
and why not send the
healthiest man we have?

704
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.660
- That's precisely what I was thinking.

705
00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:54.111
- How will this help us?

706
00:45:54.111 --> 00:45:55.028
- It won't.

707
00:45:56.004 --> 00:45:57.460
(ominous music)

708
00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:59.410
- You could search for supplies.

709
00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.070
Perhaps get more cigarettes?

710
00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:02.740
- I see what this is.

711
00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:04.740
Can't you see she's playing us. Shannon?

712
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:08.363
Jeez.

713
00:46:08.363 --> 00:46:10.340
First. you say there's danger outside.

714
00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.990
Now you're saying we should go exploring?

715
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:15.400
If you're so goddamned
interested in what's out there.

716
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.517
why don't you go yourself?

717
00:46:17.517 --> 00:46:18.350
- Horen.

718
00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:22.240
please don't let your fear of the outside

719
00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.800
bring hatred to this household.

720
00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.090
- I am not afraid of nothing.

721
00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:27.660
But I can goddamn guarantee

722
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.600
that you're not gonna
make me go out there.

723
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.867
This is my building!

724
00:46:30.867 --> 00:46:33.260
- And what do you suggest?

725
00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.900
That we all starve?

726
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.670
That we watch our children
turn into bones and skin?

727
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.050
We can only ration our meals
so much further. Horen.

728
00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.283
- Oh Lord. not again.

729
00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.270
- You must go.

730
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.750
- I must not do anything!

731
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:50.110
Last time I checked. this
was still a free country!

732
00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:51.163
- Are you sure about that?

733
00:46:51.163 --> 00:46:52.420
- Yes. I am sure!

734
00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.760
- [Abrahem] This is our best option.

735
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.593
- [Horen] Why don't you listen to this?

736
00:46:54.593 --> 00:46:56.379
- [Martha] You know. the
children are going to hear this

737
00:46:56.379 --> 00:46:58.022
and then we're going to
have to explain it to them.

738
00:46:58.022 --> 00:47:00.918
(intense music)
(adults arguing)

739
00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:01.751
- I'll go!

740
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:08.820
- Joanna. you should be
the last one listening in.

741
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.473
Get back upstairs now.

742
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:13.163
- No.

743
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:18.253
- Excuse me?

744
00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:25.720
Is there someone else up there?

745
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.033
All of you. back upstairs now!

746
00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.900
- You need someone to go outside. right?

747
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:36.510
Well.

748
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:38.460
I don't even really live here.

749
00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.110
And you've all been so nice
to let me stay while I...

750
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:42.883
get better.

751
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.250
But I can help.

752
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:47.823
- You will do no such thing.

753
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.900
I made a promise to your mother

754
00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.780
that I intend to keep.

755
00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.500
- But I can go. Aunt Martha.

756
00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.903
I saw the balloon.

757
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.380
I wanna help for once.

758
00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:05.840
- And you're still
experiencing these delusions.

759
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.910
Child. you need to sleep.

760
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:10.580
Abrahem. will you take
her upstairs. please?

761
00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.420
(ominous music)

762
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.363
- Just give me a chance. Aunt Martha.

763
00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.160
I'll do a good job. I promise!

764
00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:19.993
- I'll go!

765
00:48:19.993 --> 00:48:20.826
I'll go!

766
00:48:20.826 --> 00:48:21.960
- No. Mr. Burton!

767
00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.300
- Shannon. why is your foster
child chiming in on this?

768
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.133
- Hush!

769
00:48:26.133 --> 00:48:28.700
- But he's right. why
should Horen have to go?

770
00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.550
- I don't have to do anything. honey.

771
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:33.810
But I am out of cigarettes.

772
00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.290
Plus I wanna see this balloon

773
00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:37.193
you've been talking about for myself.

774
00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:39.803
Some of us believe you.

775
00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.883
- Prepare a suit for him.

776
00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.133
And don't ever question me again.

777
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.070
- Why didn't you let me go?

778
00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:21.343
- They won't listen to you. Walter.

779
00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.460
- [Walter] Mr. Burton?

780
00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.440
- [Horen] Walter.

781
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:45.273
come on in.

782
00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.780
- You really leaving?

783
00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:05.903
- Sorry. kiddo.

784
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.793
Whatever's out there's
gotta be better than this.

785
00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:15.730
Besides.

786
00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.970
I want to get me a look at
that balloon your friend saw.

787
00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:20.510
Can't wait to see Martha's face

788
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.147
when I come back and tell her that.

789
00:50:22.147 --> 00:50:23.880
(Horen chuckling)

790
00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.203
- So you're coming back?

791
00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:28.390
- Of course I'm coming back.

792
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:30.460
And I'm gonna have Felix with me

793
00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.170
and I'll tell him all the crazy shit

794
00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:33.363
that woman's been up to.

795
00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:36.196
(Horen chuckling)

796
00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:38.573
Hey.

797
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:41.360
I'm gonna need someone to keep an eye

798
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:42.710
on my stuff while I'm gone.

799
00:50:43.759 --> 00:50:46.489
You think you can handle
that for me. kiddo?

800
00:50:46.489 --> 00:50:48.322
- Yeah. I can do that.

801
00:50:51.008 --> 00:50:51.841
- Good.

802
00:50:51.841 --> 00:50:54.674
(Horen chuckling)

803
00:51:00.638 --> 00:51:03.388
(wheel cranking)

804
00:51:16.351 --> 00:51:17.528
(scream screeching)

805
00:51:17.528 --> 00:51:20.028
(eerie music)

806
00:51:28.851 --> 00:51:31.601
(sinister music)

807
00:52:07.668 --> 00:52:09.918
- Walter. guys. come quick!

808
00:52:11.169 --> 00:52:13.836
(intense music)

809
00:52:20.816 --> 00:52:23.483
(keys clinking)

810
00:52:36.196 --> 00:52:39.029
(ghostly moaning)

811
00:52:47.544 --> 00:52:50.127
(woman crying)

812
00:52:55.862 --> 00:52:56.695
Mother?

813
00:52:57.712 --> 00:53:00.379
(ominous music)

814
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:09.907
(Martha screaming)

815
00:53:11.715 --> 00:53:14.465
- You ignorant child!

816
00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:20.698
(Martha screaming)

817
00:53:20.698 --> 00:53:23.448
(Joanna gasping)

818
00:53:32.683 --> 00:53:35.683
(Joanna whimpering)

819
00:54:01.425 --> 00:54:03.925
(eerie music)

820
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:25.913
- Thanks. honey.

821
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:29.230
I like the fight in you.

822
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:30.063
Keep it up.

823
00:54:36.795 --> 00:54:37.628
Girls.

824
00:54:43.463 --> 00:54:46.263
Take care of my room like we said?

825
00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.493
- Yeah. I can do that.

826
00:54:51.177 --> 00:54:54.177
(somber jazz music)

827
00:54:58.982 --> 00:55:01.649
(ominous music)

828
00:55:23.795 --> 00:55:27.128
Well. let's get this over with. I guess.

829
00:55:29.235 --> 00:55:31.902
(ominous music)

830
00:55:36.972 --> 00:55:38.472
- [Martha] Cloths.

831
00:55:46.319 --> 00:55:49.152
(hammer thudding)

832
00:55:53.639 --> 00:55:56.389
(hammer banging)

833
00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.255
♪ The night was mighty dark ♪

834
00:56:01.255 --> 00:56:05.624
♪ So dark you couldn't see ♪

835
00:56:05.624 --> 00:56:06.870
♪ For the moon ♪

836
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:08.320
- We're calling a meeting.

837
00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.241
- What is it?

838
00:56:09.241 --> 00:56:10.830
(Walter shushing)

839
00:56:10.830 --> 00:56:11.780
- Martha's napping.

840
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:31.990
We wanted to meet because them
adults have been scaring us.

841
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:33.740
They must have you guys scared too.

842
00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.933
- My aunt won't listen to anyone.

843
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:43.473
We're worried.

844
00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.690
- But Martha takes care of us.

845
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:47.523
- Not no more.

846
00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.853
- I saw something out that window.

847
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:57.253
It was a bright. yellow
balloon full of life.

848
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.600
And Martha doesn't want to
hear it. she won't listen.

849
00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.560
- And she made Horen leave.

850
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.570
He would've helped us.

851
00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:05.390
- [Isolina] So what do we do?

852
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:06.530
- [Joanna] Well. the
first step is finding out

853
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:08.390
if it's safe outside.

854
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:10.163
We're just not sure how.

855
00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:13.163
- Even if we find out that it's safe.

856
00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:15.043
how do we get out?

857
00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:17.020
- We'll have to convince the adults

858
00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:19.040
to let us have a say in things.

859
00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.390
- And if they don't listen?

860
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:22.760
- I'm good with locks.

861
00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.040
I could go in the kitchen.
I could steal some rope.

862
00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:26.980
We could tie them up.

863
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:30.280
- Just until we get outside and.

864
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:33.080
and then we'll show them that it's safe.

865
00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.473
If it's safe.

866
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.300
- What do you think?

867
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:41.230
- Papa said that Martha will protect us.

868
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:42.630
- [Isolina] Yeah but is she?

869
00:57:43.524 --> 00:57:45.690
- [Isabel] We should wait for Papa.

870
00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:47.167
- [Isolina] How much
longer are we gonna wait?

871
00:57:47.167 --> 00:57:48.186
(eerie music)

872
00:57:48.186 --> 00:57:51.019
(sisters arguing)

873
00:57:53.821 --> 00:57:56.392
(Joanna huffing)

874
00:57:56.392 --> 00:57:59.059
(intense music)

875
00:58:00.435 --> 00:58:02.240
(Joanna clapping)
- Look.

876
00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.370
we've been told that adults are
supposed to take care of us.

877
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:06.423
protect us.

878
00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:08.550
But how can they do that

879
00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:10.610
if they can't even agree with each other?

880
00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:13.210
Okay. we can't keep waiting for them.

881
00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:14.463
We have to do something.

882
00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:20.843
- We're in.

883
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:25.790
- Okay.

884
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:28.800
Then everyone just keep an eye out

885
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.410
for anything that could tell
us what's going on outside.

886
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:33.610
Cracks in the window. changes
in the light. anything.

887
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.213
And then we'll meet back here
when we have more information.

888
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:38.483
All those in favor?

889
00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:42.073
Yay.

890
00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.571
- Yay.
- Yay.

891
00:58:45.571 --> 00:58:46.531
- Yay.

892
00:58:46.531 --> 00:58:47.364
- Yay!

893
00:58:52.674 --> 00:58:55.341
(ominous music)

894
00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:00.130
- Very well.

895
00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:01.890
Let's conclude this meeting for now.

896
00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:03.920
Martha will be waking up soon.

897
00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:05.510
Everyone just keep an eye out

898
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:08.221
and we'll meet back when
we have more info. okay?

899
00:59:08.221 --> 00:59:11.138
(unsettling music)

900
00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:17.083
- You know. I actually have
some ideas that may help.

901
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:19.970
- Great.

902
00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:22.160
You can tell Walter on the way out.

903
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.373
- Oh. okay.

904
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.700
I think this is the right move.

905
00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.063
- Yes. certainly.

906
00:59:28.979 --> 00:59:31.396
- [Isabel] Isolina. let's go.

907
00:59:32.851 --> 00:59:35.518
(ominous music)

908
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:37.243
- That was good.

909
00:59:38.963 --> 00:59:40.830
Isolina is smart.

910
00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:42.037
We oughta talk to her.

911
00:59:43.613 --> 00:59:45.050
(Joanna quivering)

912
00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:45.883
Joanna?

913
00:59:47.459 --> 00:59:49.959
(eerie music)

914
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:54.740
- I'm not sure how much
longer I can stay here.

915
00:59:57.507 --> 01:00:00.072
(Joanna gasping)

916
01:00:00.072 --> 01:00:02.739
(door knocking)

917
01:00:03.635 --> 01:00:05.400
(knob rattling)

918
01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.203
- You oughta come downstairs. now!

919
01:00:08.776 --> 01:00:09.917
(ominous music)

920
01:00:09.917 --> 01:00:11.870
(door rattling)
(Abrahem whimpering)

921
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:14.453
(door banging)

922
01:00:17.373 --> 01:00:18.206
- Joanna.

923
01:00:19.114 --> 01:00:21.697
(door banging)

924
01:00:25.031 --> 01:00:26.683
- Identify yourself!

925
01:00:26.683 --> 01:00:27.793
(door thudding)

926
01:00:27.793 --> 01:00:29.655
- [Isolina] Papa?

927
01:00:29.655 --> 01:00:31.080
- What's happening?

928
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.430
- I'd say someone wants in.

929
01:00:33.345 --> 01:00:35.666
- They're gonna break down the damn door!

930
01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:37.140
(gun cranking)

931
01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:41.103
- We are armed and
cocked. identify yourself!

932
01:00:41.974 --> 01:00:44.518
(wood thudding)

933
01:00:44.518 --> 01:00:47.185
(ominous music)

934
01:00:48.107 --> 01:00:49.524
Get upstairs. go!

935
01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:52.701
(door rattling)

936
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:54.141
(door cracking)

937
01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:54.974
Horen!

938
01:00:57.652 --> 01:01:00.100
(Horen laughing)
You may be contaminated!

939
01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.465
You must exit immediately!

940
01:01:01.465 --> 01:01:02.298
(Horen laughing)
Horen!

941
01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.183
I'm warning you now!

942
01:01:05.183 --> 01:01:07.909
We can not take this lightly.

943
01:01:07.909 --> 01:01:10.960
(Horen laughing)

944
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.793
- Oh.

945
01:01:13.424 --> 01:01:17.150
Hey. kiddo. you're a sight for sore eyes.

946
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:19.030
- Mr. Burton. where did you--

947
01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.176
- You're not sick.

948
01:01:23.232 --> 01:01:26.120
- Horen. I mean it!

949
01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.744
Exit now or endure the consequences!

950
01:01:29.744 --> 01:01:32.725
(flame sizzling)

951
01:01:32.725 --> 01:01:34.483
- What did you see?

952
01:01:34.483 --> 01:01:36.661
(faint jazz music)

953
01:01:36.661 --> 01:01:39.194
(gunshot booming)
(Walter yelling)

954
01:01:39.194 --> 01:01:41.861
(ominous music)

955
01:01:48.063 --> 01:01:49.130
- Back!

956
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:50.033
Back. boy!

957
01:01:53.461 --> 01:01:54.597
Quick!

958
01:01:54.597 --> 01:01:58.804
Get his body out. could
be carrying the disease.

959
01:01:58.804 --> 01:02:01.473
(unsettling music)

960
01:02:01.473 --> 01:02:02.306
- Oh.

961
01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:04.723
Oh my God.

962
01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:08.470
- Shannon!

963
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:10.160
This is a state of emergency!

964
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.293
Don't act like an invalid!

965
01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:15.050
(ominous music)

966
01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:15.883
- Yes.

967
01:02:19.013 --> 01:02:20.450
Yes. ma'am.

968
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:21.750
- Quick!

969
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:24.103
Before he infects the entire building!

970
01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:30.060
I don't know how you got out of your rooms

971
01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.600
but you better go back to bed now!

972
01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:32.433
Now!

973
01:02:36.802 --> 01:02:39.552
(Joanna huffing)

974
01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:20.203
Finally here to help?

975
01:03:21.502 --> 01:03:22.600
- Oh.

976
01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.110
no. not quite.

977
01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:27.454
- Oh well. I think it's time you start.

978
01:03:27.454 --> 01:03:30.460
You need to spend less time
with that orphan boy. anyway.

979
01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:32.663
He seems to be hindering your recovery.

980
01:03:34.179 --> 01:03:36.929
(floor creaking)

981
01:03:38.479 --> 01:03:40.640
- I think we should talk.

982
01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.610
- Oh well. perhaps if you helped out more

983
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:45.570
there would be time for talk but not now.

984
01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:47.243
- We need to talk about Horen.

985
01:04:00.063 --> 01:04:03.063
- Why would you say that name to me?

986
01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.060
- He just looked so...

987
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:09.683
normal.

988
01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:13.280
- Do you think something was wrong?

989
01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:16.230
- Who's to say?

990
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:17.793
He was never easy to read.

991
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.490
- At least he got to have one more smoke.

992
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:25.097
- He must've raced to
the grocer to get them.

993
01:04:25.097 --> 01:04:28.014
(Isabel chuckling)

994
01:04:29.468 --> 01:04:31.718
- Do you think he saw Papa?

995
01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:40.173
- If he did. I'm sure they
found a cigarette to share.

996
01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.313
- Yeah. I bet they did.

997
01:04:51.098 --> 01:04:53.765
(door creaking)

998
01:04:55.451 --> 01:04:58.750
(door thudding)

999
01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:01.170
- We can't pretend like
last night didn't happen.

1000
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:02.570
- [Martha] Leave it. Joanna.

1001
01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.280
- He wasn't even sick.

1002
01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.240
What if it's okay outside?

1003
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.443
- Who's to say Horen wasn't sick?

1004
01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:17.433
He may have just not
been displaying symptoms.

1005
01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.343
Now stop this this instant!

1006
01:05:23.433 --> 01:05:27.933
(Isolina and Isabel speaking muffled)

1007
01:05:34.641 --> 01:05:37.558
(Tomás sniffling)

1008
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:47.763
(door knocking)

1009
01:05:47.763 --> 01:05:49.980
- [Isolina] Tomás. come out here!

1010
01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.230
- [Tomás] Just a minute.

1011
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.600
- [Isolina] You better
open these doors right now!

1012
01:05:57.867 --> 01:05:58.700
- [Isabel] What is he doing?

1013
01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.836
- Tomás!
- Tomás!

1014
01:06:00.836 --> 01:06:01.810
- Stop!

1015
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:04.311
- I just think there should
have been more of a discussion.

1016
01:06:04.311 --> 01:06:06.663
- I don't require permission.

1017
01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:07.989
(ceiling thudding)

1018
01:06:07.989 --> 01:06:09.322
- [Tomás] Stop!

1019
01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:11.644
- [Isolina] Tomás!

1020
01:06:11.644 --> 01:06:16.394
You're going to make me break
the door if you don't stop!

1021
01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.613
- Maybe some of the kids can
start sitting in on meetings.

1022
01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:24.463
- Open this door now!

1023
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:29.330
- You get out of there
this instant. young lady!

1024
01:06:29.330 --> 01:06:31.514
- I'm sorry. ma'am. but he won't come out.

1025
01:06:31.514 --> 01:06:32.347
- [Martha] Who?

1026
01:06:32.347 --> 01:06:33.273
- Our brother!

1027
01:06:36.944 --> 01:06:38.380
(Martha knocking)

1028
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.950
- Tomas. this is Martha.

1029
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:42.773
Open the door right now.

1030
01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.855
What exactly is going on in here?

1031
01:06:49.855 --> 01:06:50.920
- Nothing.

1032
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.437
- Really?

1033
01:06:52.437 --> 01:06:54.830
What. you're just hiding
from your sisters?

1034
01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:57.440
That's not very nice.

1035
01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.300
- I...

1036
01:06:59.156 --> 01:06:59.989
I guess.

1037
01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:05.003
- What do you think your
father would say about this?

1038
01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:10.693
Up now.

1039
01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.640
- Aunt Martha. he's just tired.

1040
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.320
Let's get back to the count.

1041
01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.790
- Get up now!

1042
01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:18.623
- What?

1043
01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:37.384
(foreboding music)

1044
01:07:48.251 --> 01:07:50.960
(Martha gasping)

1045
01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.850
- Get out of the room now!

1046
01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.930
Not only has he threatened
this entire building

1047
01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:13.070
but we're using nearly half our medical

1048
01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:16.760
and construction resources for repair.

1049
01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.010
Tomás will be denied two
meals for this burden.

1050
01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:23.090
Mm-hmm. yeah. check everywhere.

1051
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:25.671
Even the smallest places.

1052
01:08:25.671 --> 01:08:26.504
(Rhonda coughing)

1053
01:08:26.504 --> 01:08:27.337
Little scrap.

1054
01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:32.003
Anything could be an infection.

1055
01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.990
- [Shannon] He's clear.

1056
01:08:38.209 --> 01:08:39.759
- Hey. where are you two going?

1057
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:47.003
- Little Rhonda just
had to use the lavatory.

1058
01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:49.823
- Oh. well.

1059
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:56.757
why don't we have her
inspected first and then

1060
01:08:59.192 --> 01:09:00.737
you can be on your way. hmmm?

1061
01:09:06.798 --> 01:09:07.631
- Martha.

1062
01:09:18.915 --> 01:09:21.582
- How long you been sick. honey?

1063
01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.043
- She good.

1064
01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.730
I been with her all week.

1065
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:32.830
She ain't got nothing wrong.

1066
01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:34.410
- Her forehead is quite warm.

1067
01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:35.243
- We run warm.

1068
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:38.210
My momma always said that.

1069
01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.350
- Look. son. I know that
you love your sister

1070
01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:47.013
but we have to take proper
precautions. don't we?

1071
01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.850
I'll tell you what. you
put a gas mask on her

1072
01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:54.400
and stick her in Horen's room.

1073
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.297
- I'm going too.

1074
01:09:56.684 --> 01:09:58.007
- Oh.

1075
01:09:58.007 --> 01:10:01.627
But if you both go then
you might get sick too

1076
01:10:01.627 --> 01:10:03.383
and we don't want that. do we?

1077
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.333
- I guess not.

1078
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:12.870
- She's gonna be fine.

1079
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:15.197
She'll be there a short time.

1080
01:10:15.197 --> 01:10:17.127
That's okay. isn't it?

1081
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:21.539
- I guess.

1082
01:10:21.539 --> 01:10:22.372
- Great.

1083
01:10:23.618 --> 01:10:26.285
(ominous music)

1084
01:10:35.255 --> 01:10:38.005
(chair scraping)

1085
01:10:44.233 --> 01:10:45.383
- [Abrahem] It's clear.

1086
01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:50.263
(somber music)

1087
01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.603
- How is she?

1088
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:54.383
- She's weak.

1089
01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:58.293
Her energy is very low
and her throat is swollen.

1090
01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:01.100
Can't tell if she's contagious.

1091
01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.273
So I've isolated her in a dresser.

1092
01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:08.670
- Any new information regarding the hole?

1093
01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:09.670
- [Abrahem] Not much.

1094
01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:12.183
The kid certainly
created quite an opening.

1095
01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.100
It's possible that something
could've made its way in.

1096
01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.103
- Something definitely got in.

1097
01:11:20.844 --> 01:11:23.290
That little girl goes for weeks

1098
01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:26.220
without showing any signs of illness

1099
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.778
then suddenly she's frail and unwell.

1100
01:11:29.778 --> 01:11:32.611
(stairs creaking)

1101
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:36.073
We mustn't take this lightly.

1102
01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:43.710
Who's to say that she won't
infect the entire building?

1103
01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:45.120
- Yes but...

1104
01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:47.830
What if it's just a cold?

1105
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:48.983
- What if it's not?

1106
01:11:52.277 --> 01:11:55.610
I'm not willing to take a
chance on one orphan girl

1107
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:57.623
causing an infection. are you?

1108
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.050
- I suppose you're right.

1109
01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:03.720
- Whatever you think best.

1110
01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.810
- We mustn't risk our lives

1111
01:12:06.757 --> 01:12:08.003
on a little orphan girl.

1112
01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:10.090
She must be ejected.

1113
01:12:14.918 --> 01:12:17.124
(foreboding music)

1114
01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:20.041
(dresser rattling)

1115
01:12:21.569 --> 01:12:25.402
(dramatic instrumental music)

1116
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:27.883
- Faster. come on!

1117
01:12:30.016 --> 01:12:32.683
(ominous music)

1118
01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:42.411
- [Walter] Save her!

1119
01:12:42.411 --> 01:12:43.583
Rhonda. stay close. I'll find you!

1120
01:12:47.153 --> 01:12:47.986
- Joanna.

1121
01:12:48.923 --> 01:12:50.273
- [Walter] Rhonda!

1122
01:12:50.273 --> 01:12:51.368
(Joanna grunting)

1123
01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:53.028
(intense music)

1124
01:12:53.028 --> 01:12:54.235
- Fight it!

1125
01:12:54.235 --> 01:12:57.480
Fight the darkness. my niece.
- Please.

1126
01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:59.250
Just let me close the door
again. she'll be fine in there.

1127
01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.160
She won't make anyone sick. I promise!

1128
01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.023
- Oh. I'm afraid we can't
take that chance now.

1129
01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.707
(ominous music)

1130
01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.773
You're gonna be just fine.

1131
01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:21.210
(eerie music)

1132
01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:29.533
Start removing the wood for an ejection.

1133
01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:39.534
(eerie music)

1134
01:13:39.534 --> 01:13:41.093
- [Rhonda] Walter!

1135
01:13:41.093 --> 01:13:42.452
- [Martha] Quiet already!

1136
01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:44.496
Abrahem. take her out!

1137
01:13:44.496 --> 01:13:47.651
(door thudding)

1138
01:13:47.651 --> 01:13:50.568
(unsettling music)

1139
01:14:33.746 --> 01:14:36.746
(doorknob rattling)

1140
01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:47.585
- I didn't mean to wake you.

1141
01:14:47.585 --> 01:14:48.668
- You didn't.

1142
01:14:50.178 --> 01:14:51.655
What're you doing?

1143
01:14:51.655 --> 01:14:52.903
- I have to get her.

1144
01:14:52.903 --> 01:14:54.673
I need one of them suits.

1145
01:14:56.550 --> 01:15:00.060
(thunder rumbling)

1146
01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.310
- I'm sorry. I tired.

1147
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:03.333
- It ain't your job.

1148
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:05.450
That's why I gotta go.

1149
01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:10.640
- Walter. you won't even
make it past the first door

1150
01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.810
without waking them up.

1151
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:13.083
- I have to try.

1152
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:16.583
I'm all she got.

1153
01:15:28.469 --> 01:15:32.500
- I can't believe she could
do such horrible things.

1154
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.870
She was never the warmest person

1155
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:35.770
but she was always a good person.

1156
01:15:35.770 --> 01:15:37.420
- Them nice people can turn mean.

1157
01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.950
Put in the wrong situation.

1158
01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:47.120
- What if we came up with
a better plan together?

1159
01:15:48.930 --> 01:15:50.670
Something that would
actually get you outside

1160
01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:52.320
and not just get you in trouble?

1161
01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:57.892
- I'm listening.

1162
01:15:57.892 --> 01:16:00.559
(door thudding)

1163
01:16:01.775 --> 01:16:04.280
(thunder rumbling)

1164
01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.113
- You okay?

1165
01:16:06.601 --> 01:16:09.670
- I messed up everything.

1166
01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:11.870
If I hadn't made that hole.

1167
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:14.390
none of these would have happened.

1168
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:18.070
I was going through my
baseball cards last week.

1169
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:22.120
hit the nightstand. made the
hole and let in the disease.

1170
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.230
I just screw everything up.

1171
01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:25.623
- Wait. when?

1172
01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:27.540
- [Tomá] All the time.

1173
01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.373
- No.

1174
01:16:29.966 --> 01:16:30.799
No.

1175
01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:33.070
When'd you make that hole?

1176
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:35.313
- Last week.

1177
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:40.583
- My sister been sick for two weeks.

1178
01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:44.660
No way that hole made her sick
if it was just a week ago.

1179
01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:47.523
Show it to me.

1180
01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.573
- And it took up this whole space?

1181
01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:55.593
- Just about.

1182
01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:58.803
I covered it with this.

1183
01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:03.830
- How much time do you spend in here?

1184
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:07.340
- Plenty.

1185
01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:08.173
Why?

1186
01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:12.378
- If anyone should be
sick. it should be you.

1187
01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:13.461
- No kidding.

1188
01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:18.963
(bed creaking)
(Isolina yawning)

1189
01:17:18.963 --> 01:17:21.880
(thunder rumbling)

1190
01:17:23.633 --> 01:17:25.113
- And you look fine.

1191
01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.473
Besides. more importantly.
a hole this big.

1192
01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.713
we should all be sick.

1193
01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:37.500
If there really is a disease.
(ominous music)

1194
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.100
We need to call another meeting.

1195
01:17:40.047 --> 01:17:40.880
Now.

1196
01:17:45.313 --> 01:17:47.238
- [Martha] And I think there
should be repercussions for it.

1197
01:17:47.238 --> 01:17:48.370
- Certainly.
- Children. we will call

1198
01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:50.290
for you when the meal is ready!

1199
01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.160
- We demand to be included
in the building meeting.

1200
01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.073
- Excuse me.

1201
01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:58.648
- We live here too and
we deserve to be heard.

1202
01:17:58.648 --> 01:18:00.120
(Martha chuckling)

1203
01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.030
- You're but children.

1204
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:02.640
you don't even know what you're saying.

1205
01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.993
Now go back upstairs.

1206
01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.800
Tomás.

1207
01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:10.083
take your sisters upstairs.

1208
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:13.913
- Rhonda wasn't infected.

1209
01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.320
She's been sick for nearly two weeks.

1210
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.770
Walter's just been hiding it.

1211
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:24.650
The hole's only been around for one week

1212
01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:26.047
amnd Tomás and the girls
have been sleeping by it

1213
01:18:26.047 --> 01:18:28.100
the entire time and they're fine.

1214
01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.773
- I feel great.

1215
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:34.230
- I bet it's safer out
there than it is in here.

1216
01:18:38.099 --> 01:18:41.003
- That can't possible
be true. can it. Martha?

1217
01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.640
We would've kicked that
poor girl out for nothing!

1218
01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:46.956
And Horen!

1219
01:18:46.956 --> 01:18:48.423
- That little girl was sick.

1220
01:18:49.410 --> 01:18:50.910
You ran her temp yourself.

1221
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:51.750
She was sick.

1222
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:54.000
- They ain't saying she
wasn't sick. Abrahem!

1223
01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:06.300
- Is this another one
of your lies. Joanna?

1224
01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.720
- It's not a lie.

1225
01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:09.373
- First the balloon.

1226
01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:14.340
and now this.

1227
01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:16.475
- There really was a balloon.

1228
01:19:16.475 --> 01:19:19.308
(Martha laughing)

1229
01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:24.440
- Do you any of you really
know this little girl

1230
01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.523
who claims to be your leader?

1231
01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:30.730
Which of you knows why she's here?

1232
01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:32.543
Raise your hand. huh?

1233
01:19:34.632 --> 01:19:39.190
Who knows why this girl's
mother dumped her here.

1234
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:41.813
despite the dangers outside?

1235
01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:45.150
(eerie music)

1236
01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.683
My sister.

1237
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.920
her mother.

1238
01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.840
was having dinner one night

1239
01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:58.680
when this one had one of her episodes

1240
01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:04.478
and began stabbing her with silverware.

1241
01:20:04.478 --> 01:20:07.145
(ominous music)

1242
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:11.693
How many times did you stab her?

1243
01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:14.463
15. was it?

1244
01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:21.373
Took a 200 pound man to just pull her off.

1245
01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:23.323
She

1246
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:25.210
mustn't

1247
01:20:25.210 --> 01:20:26.523
be trusted!

1248
01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:29.383
Oh. she'll hurt anyone.

1249
01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:31.183
Even herself.

1250
01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.700
Now go ahead. pull up her sleeves.

1251
01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.523
I bet she's covered in cuts.

1252
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:42.980
How much must a mother
fear her own daughter

1253
01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:45.775
in order to leave her behind?

1254
01:20:45.775 --> 01:20:47.477
(sinister music)

1255
01:20:47.477 --> 01:20:48.965
(Joanna screaming)

1256
01:20:48.965 --> 01:20:51.507
- Quick. Walter. as we
planned. grab the rope!

1257
01:20:51.507 --> 01:20:53.169
- [Shannon] Leave her alone!

1258
01:20:53.169 --> 01:20:54.684
(Tomaś screaming)

1259
01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:55.746
(Shannon yelping)

1260
01:20:55.746 --> 01:20:57.521
(Shannon groaning)

1261
01:20:57.521 --> 01:21:01.354
(dramatic instrumental music)

1262
01:21:05.309 --> 01:21:06.914
- [Walter] Tie her up!

1263
01:21:06.914 --> 01:21:07.816
- No!

1264
01:21:07.816 --> 01:21:10.152
You cannot behave this way!

1265
01:21:10.152 --> 01:21:13.069
(Shannon groaning)

1266
01:21:14.179 --> 01:21:15.347
(Walter thudding)

1267
01:21:15.347 --> 01:21:16.616
- [Walter] Tomás. the rope!

1268
01:21:16.616 --> 01:21:19.233
(Abrahem groaning)

1269
01:21:19.233 --> 01:21:23.130
- Oh. you're childish if you
think it's better out there.

1270
01:21:23.130 --> 01:21:25.990
- I am a child. Aunt Martha.

1271
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:29.823
(dramatic instrumental music)

1272
01:21:33.512 --> 01:21:35.262
I'll be taking these.

1273
01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:42.963
(Martha groaning)

1274
01:21:42.963 --> 01:21:45.463
(eerie music)

1275
01:21:56.695 --> 01:21:57.880
(girls giggling)

1276
01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:01.290
Well. thanks everyone. that
wasn't quite what we planned.

1277
01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:02.890
But thanks for sticking with it.

1278
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:05.653
So go pack.

1279
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:08.762
But only the essentials.

1280
01:22:08.762 --> 01:22:12.654
(Martha muffled moaning)

1281
01:22:12.654 --> 01:22:15.321
