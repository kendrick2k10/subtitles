00:02:21.068 --> 00:02:25.517
-Mom? Dad?

4
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.793
Nick?

5
00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.275
-Grace!

6
00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:50.206
-Grace.
Unlock the door.

7
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.310
-Sweetie. what's wrong?

8
00:02:56.137 --> 00:02:57.620
-Jesus!

9
00:02:57.724 --> 00:02:58.724
What are you doing. Jake?

10
00:02:58.827 --> 00:02:59.896
-I'm gonna break it down.

11
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.068
-Give me the bat. son.

12
00:03:02.172 --> 00:03:04.000
You're the worst player
on the team.

13
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:19.448
-Give me that.

14
00:03:21.482 --> 00:03:24.758
-Oh. it smells. like. so bad.

15
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.103
-Grace has
been taken.

16
00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:42.172
-She must be sleep-talking.

17
00:03:42.275 --> 00:03:45.034
-You should not have inhabited
this house.

18
00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:47.827
It belongs to Deominous.

19
00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:49.965
-Oh. come on.
She's full of shit.

20
00:03:50.068 --> 00:03:51.862
I mean. really.
A demon named Deominous?

21
00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.586
-Shut up. Jake.
-Shut up. Jake.

22
00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.793
-Yeah. shut up. Jake.

23
00:03:55.896 --> 00:03:58.034
Shut up. Jake.
Shut up. Jake.

24
00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.931
-Aah!

25
00:04:00.034 --> 00:04:01.758
-Okay.

26
00:04:01.862 --> 00:04:03.068
-Deominous. listen.

27
00:04:03.172 --> 00:04:05.137
My wife and I --
This is Tammy.

28
00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:08.724
-Hi.
-Deominous knows who you are.

29
00:04:08.827 --> 00:04:10.379
-Right.

30
00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:14.068
Tammy and I. we spent
a lot of money on this house.

31
00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:18.137
See. she's a decorator.
and I'm a real estate agent.

32
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:20.827
Ken Sellers --
and I'll sell your house!

33
00:04:20.931 --> 00:04:25.344
Anyway. we wanted this house
to be special for our kids.

34
00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:26.586
-Yeah. right.

35
00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:28.965
-And the problem is.

36
00:04:29.068 --> 00:04:31.551
we don't really want to move out
because of you.

37
00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:36.482
So is there some way for Grace
to hop on back into her own body

38
00:04:36.586 --> 00:04:39.620
and you can move
into the guest room?

39
00:04:39.724 --> 00:04:41.620
-What?
-Well. the basement.

40
00:04:41.724 --> 00:04:43.172
You can live in the basement.

41
00:04:43.275 --> 00:04:44.413
-No!

42
00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.413
-Alright.
well. what do you want from us?

43
00:04:47.517 --> 00:04:50.689
-Human sacrifice.

44
00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:52.068
-Uh...

45
00:04:52.172 --> 00:04:55.482
What if we -- we found you
another sacrifice?

46
00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:57.517
-A-A bigger one!

47
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.448
No money down.
-Ken!

48
00:05:00.724 --> 00:05:03.655
-Could -- Could we have Grace
back then?

49
00:05:03.758 --> 00:05:05.655
-And our house?

50
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:14.655
-Grace?
-Honey!

51
00:05:14.758 --> 00:05:15.896
-Grace.

52
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.862
-What's going on?

53
00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:21.103
-Mom and Dad made a deal
with a demon for your soul back.

54
00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:23.275
Now we have to find
someone else to sacrifice.

55
00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:24.896
And good luck with that.

56
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.724
Who's desperate enough to move
into a house with a demon?

57
00:05:29.344 --> 00:05:32.965
-Hi. I'm Will.
I'm here to help.

58
00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:36.034
Oh. well. Presto Paste
is sorry to hear

59
00:05:36.137 --> 00:05:38.931
that you think the new recipe
is too salty.

60
00:05:39.034 --> 00:05:41.206
But we now have
more sodium bicarbonate

61
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.862
than any major brand.

62
00:05:42.965 --> 00:05:47.103
increasing the overall whitening
impact by half...a percent.

63
00:05:47.206 --> 00:05:49.896
which is actually
a pretty big deal

64
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.827
in the toothpaste community.

65
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:54.172
Yes. the forums are going crazy.

66
00:05:55.827 --> 00:05:58.068
Hi.

67
00:05:58.172 --> 00:06:00.344
Hey. you look nice.

68
00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.413
Smell good.

69
00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:06.965
Hey. Amy.

70
00:06:07.068 --> 00:06:09.551
listen. I'm really sorry
I wasn't there tonight.

71
00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:11.862
It's just. you know.
I had the shift

72
00:06:11.965 --> 00:06:14.310
and people brush their teeth
at night. and if they're like.

73
00:06:14.413 --> 00:06:16.172
"Hey. something tastes weird
with my toothpaste.

74
00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:20.068
I need to talk to someone now!"
you know. they have me.

75
00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:22.034
-What's in that?
-It's cake batter.

76
00:06:22.137 --> 00:06:26.172
-Oh. you're making a cake
at 1:00 in the morning.

77
00:06:26.275 --> 00:06:29.172
-Mmm.
No. no. no.

78
00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.793
Cake pops.

79
00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:35.793
-Ohh!
-Yeah.

80
00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:37.413
I wanted to surprise you.

81
00:06:37.517 --> 00:06:40.724
you know. celebrate your --
your big promotion.

82
00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:43.896
It was a promotion. right?

83
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.310
-Yeah.
-Okay. Yeah.

84
00:06:46.413 --> 00:06:48.931
-But you could've just come
to the dinner with me.

85
00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:52.034
You didn't have to
do all this.

86
00:06:52.137 --> 00:06:53.344
-...four decades.

87
00:06:53.448 --> 00:06:55.310
-I'm sorry.
-No. it's okay.

88
00:06:55.413 --> 00:06:57.724
-I didn't realize you've been
a Presto Paste customer

89
00:06:57.827 --> 00:07:00.000
for 40 years.

90
00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:01.827
No. I haven't stuck
with anything

91
00:07:01.931 --> 00:07:03.241
for more than a few months.

92
00:07:03.344 --> 00:07:07.862
Five years.
I mean. five years.

93
00:07:07.965 --> 00:07:09.620
Hey. where are you going?

94
00:07:09.724 --> 00:07:11.896
No. really. Amy. I am sorry.

95
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.344
I just thought you had your
coworkers and cool work friends

96
00:07:15.448 --> 00:07:18.620
and job and promotion.
so I just...

97
00:07:18.724 --> 00:07:20.758
-Okay. I get it.

98
00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.758
-Well. that's for you.

99
00:07:23.862 --> 00:07:27.551
-Will. you're making cake pops
in the middle of the night

100
00:07:27.655 --> 00:07:29.517
and answering
customer service calls.

101
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.103
-Well. I thought you --
I thought you liked my job

102
00:07:32.206 --> 00:07:34.103
because we get free toothpaste.

103
00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:36.448
-The toothpaste is terrible.
We don't even use it.

104
00:07:36.551 --> 00:07:40.517
-Well. I'm. uh. I'm not gonna
work there for forever.

105
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.103
Yes. I am.
Keep going. It's okay.

106
00:07:42.206 --> 00:07:43.758
-And what do you want to do
forever. then?

107
00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:45.655
Because you can't
quit Presto Paste

108
00:07:45.758 --> 00:07:48.172
because you can't commit
to doing anything else.

109
00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:49.344
-That's not true.

110
00:07:49.448 --> 00:07:51.034
Oh. yeah. I am.
I'm still here.

111
00:07:51.137 --> 00:07:52.931
No. no. You don't need
to speak with a supervisor.

112
00:07:53.034 --> 00:07:54.965
-O-kay.

113
00:07:55.068 --> 00:07:57.620
What happened
to your woodworking business?

114
00:07:57.724 --> 00:08:00.827
-Well. yeah. that was cool
for a while

115
00:08:00.931 --> 00:08:04.068
until. you know. I saw online
it's more economical

116
00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:07.000
to make and sell
your own candles.

117
00:08:07.103 --> 00:08:08.758
You loved those candles.

118
00:08:08.862 --> 00:08:10.931
Yeah. remember?
Seaside musk.

119
00:08:11.034 --> 00:08:13.137
Or no.

120
00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:14.413
Nah. I remember now.

121
00:08:14.517 --> 00:08:17.793
You did not like the candles.
Yeah.

122
00:08:17.896 --> 00:08:20.482
Yes. I know.
No. keep -- go on. go on.

123
00:08:20.586 --> 00:08:23.482
Just wait a second.
Wait. This is. um...

124
00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:24.724
The exercise tapes.

125
00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:27.068
I got those
from the garage sale. remember?

126
00:08:27.172 --> 00:08:31.068
Even if I haven't exactly
used them...yet.

127
00:08:31.172 --> 00:08:33.137
Uh. but the woodworking.

128
00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:35.896
I am almost halfway done
with this dresser for you.

129
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.586
And it's got character.

130
00:08:38.689 --> 00:08:39.724
But it'll get done.

131
00:08:39.827 --> 00:08:42.482
-Will.

132
00:08:42.586 --> 00:08:44.724
I don't want you to give me
an excuse.

133
00:08:44.827 --> 00:08:47.586
Or a hobby.

134
00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:49.206
Or a cake pop.

135
00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:54.482
Why didn't you
come with me tonight?

136
00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:04.206
I need to know if this means
as much to you as it does to me.

137
00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:06.586
-I want a refund.
Hello?

138
00:09:06.689 --> 00:09:07.862
-Sorry. just let me finish.

139
00:09:07.965 --> 00:09:09.448
Yes. if you mail in
your comment card

140
00:09:09.551 --> 00:09:11.689
Presto Paste
would be -- would be happy to --

141
00:09:11.793 --> 00:09:14.448
to refund you on that purchase.

142
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:15.620
Uh-huh.

143
00:09:15.724 --> 00:09:17.827
Yes. and do fill out
that survey after.

144
00:09:17.931 --> 00:09:21.448
Okay. thank you.
Okay. Alright. bye-bye.

145
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:23.655
No. Amy.
Wait. hey.

146
00:09:31.482 --> 00:09:33.275

Yeah. this might've been

164
00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:12.379
a little premature. actually.
and I shouldn't

165
00:11:12.482 --> 00:11:14.793
have wasted --
-Wait. Whoa. there.

166
00:11:14.896 --> 00:11:16.344
You didn't even take a look.

167
00:11:16.448 --> 00:11:18.000
It's a heck of a deal.
-Mm-hmm.

168
00:11:18.103 --> 00:11:19.655
-What do you say. pal?

169
00:11:19.758 --> 00:11:22.689
You look like a smart
and reliable human host.

170
00:11:22.793 --> 00:11:23.620
Don't you think so. Tammy?

171
00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:24.931
Oh. yes.

172
00:11:25.034 --> 00:11:26.965
-Oh.

173
00:11:27.068 --> 00:11:29.172
No one's ever called me
that before.

174
00:11:29.275 --> 00:11:29.862
-Oh.

175
00:11:29.965 --> 00:11:32.275
-Oh.

176
00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:33.275
Wow.

was like twice as much

179
00:11:36.206 --> 00:11:39.551
and didn't come with furniture.
like this place.

180
00:11:39.655 --> 00:11:41.413
-Well. I didn't have time
to clear out most

181
00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:44.034
of the furniture that came
with the estate. but. um...

182
00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:45.793
-Hm.
-...did you --

183
00:11:45.896 --> 00:11:47.517
did you say girlfriend?

184
00:11:49.379 --> 00:11:50.551
-Ex-girlfriend. I guess.

185
00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:52.103
-Oh.
-Yeah.

186
00:11:54.551 --> 00:11:58.517
But I don't know.
I mean. what do you guys think?

187
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.206
Should -- Should I see
if we can work things out?

188
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:04.931
I mean. love always wins. right?

189
00:12:05.034 --> 00:12:08.241
-It sounds like
you both need space.

190
00:12:08.344 --> 00:12:10.965
Take the time to learn
who youare

191
00:12:11.068 --> 00:12:13.689
before you could be together.

192
00:12:13.793 --> 00:12:14.896
-Ken's right.

193
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.689
And. while you're here.

194
00:12:16.793 --> 00:12:18.896
are there any other relatives

195
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.689
or friends
who might look for you?

196
00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:26.620
-No.
-Oh.

197
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:30.275
-But. you know.
I should probably. um.

198
00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:35.344
check it all out. right.
before I commit to anything.

199
00:12:36.413 --> 00:12:40.137
Amy always said
I hate to commit.

200
00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:43.689
-And maybe now is the time
to change that. huh. buddy?

201
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Go on.
-Yeah.

202
00:12:47.103 --> 00:12:48.000
-Have a look.

203
00:13:28.275 --> 00:13:29.793
-Uh!

204
00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:31.862
-So. what do you think?

205
00:13:31.965 --> 00:13:33.758
Interested?

206
00:13:33.862 --> 00:13:35.620
This used to be Grace's room.

207
00:13:35.724 --> 00:13:38.344
But it can be whatever you want.

208
00:13:38.448 --> 00:13:39.103
Guest room.

209
00:13:39.206 --> 00:13:40.862
Home office.

210
00:13:40.965 --> 00:13:42.724
-Woodworking shop?

211
00:13:42.827 --> 00:13:45.241
-Sure. if you want.

212
00:13:47.862 --> 00:13:50.172
-Well. if this is your room.
then.

213
00:13:50.275 --> 00:13:51.586
this must be yours. too.

214
00:13:51.689 --> 00:13:54.793
-Oh. she -- she found it here
when we moved in.

215
00:13:54.896 --> 00:13:57.275
but she doesn't want it anymore.

216
00:13:57.379 --> 00:13:59.275
-Oh. okay.

217
00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:02.517
I'll take it. then.

218
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.517
-Ah.

219
00:14:04.965 --> 00:14:06.862
Along with the house.

220
00:14:06.965 --> 00:14:08.655
-Great.

221
00:14:08.758 --> 00:14:10.482
-That's wonderful.

222
00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:13.137
-Bye.

223
00:14:41.758 --> 00:14:42.793
Amy.

224
00:14:46.413 --> 00:14:48.689
"Hey. Will.
what's your address?"

225
00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:54.310
She wants to come over.

226
00:14:54.413 --> 00:14:55.482
Right?

227
00:14:55.586 --> 00:15:00.103
"Hey. Will.
what's youraddress?"

228
00:15:01.896 --> 00:15:03.724
Oh. that's definitely it.

00:15:06.103 --> 00:15:07.344
Yeah.
Oh. yeah.

00:15:09.413 --> 00:15:10.758

00:15:12.793 --> 00:15:13.965
Mm.

00:15:14.068 --> 00:15:18.172
"Hey. Will."

234
00:15:18.275 --> 00:15:19.965
romantic pause.

00:18:59.413 --> 00:19:02.344
Ah. Not bad. for only going
to half the classes.

284
00:19:34.413 --> 00:19:36.793
That...

285
00:19:36.896 --> 00:19:39.000
...is a cool chair!

286
00:19:40.103 --> 00:19:41.551
Yes. I remember you
from last week.

287
00:19:41.655 --> 00:19:43.862
-Good. because I want
some answers.

288
00:19:43.965 --> 00:19:45.310
First off. they still
have to change

289
00:19:45.413 --> 00:19:46.344
the recipe.
-I'm sorry. but the-there's

290
00:19:46.448 --> 00:19:47.793
a lot of people that don't think

291
00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:49.482
the new recipe
is actually too salty.

292
00:19:49.586 --> 00:19:51.068
-Yeah. sure.
-Okay. look.

293
00:19:51.172 --> 00:19:53.034
maybe if you just gave
the new recipe a --

294
00:19:53.137 --> 00:19:55.586
a chance to figure itself out

295
00:19:55.689 --> 00:19:57.241
before -- before you just

296
00:19:57.344 --> 00:19:59.586
end your relationship with it
altogether.

297
00:19:59.689 --> 00:20:01.137
you wouldn't break its heart

298
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:03.931
and you wouldn't suck
its soul out and suffocate it

299
00:20:04.034 --> 00:20:07.448
and leave it just one hollow.
empty...

300
00:20:07.551 --> 00:20:08.448
tube.

301
00:20:08.551 --> 00:20:09.517
-Just transfer me.

302
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.586
-Yeah. I can transfer you
to someone else.

303
00:20:11.689 --> 00:20:13.931
No. that's fine because
the new recipe has. uh.

304
00:20:14.034 --> 00:20:15.379
better stuff to do tonight.
anyways. so....

305
00:20:15.482 --> 00:20:17.034
-Really?
-...yeah. that works out.

306
00:20:23.206 --> 00:20:25.586
-Hi. I'm Will.
and I'm here to help.

307
00:20:25.689 --> 00:20:29.137
-Okay. he's not dead.
That's good.

308
00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:31.896
That's a positive thing
for me to know.

309
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.103
-Hey. Patrick.

310
00:20:33.206 --> 00:20:35.172
I told you.
I don't really want to

311
00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:37.896
talk to anyone right now.
and this is my work phone

312
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.517
and I know

313
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.965
you know that. And.
if you have a question about

314
00:20:42.068 --> 00:20:43.275
Presto Paste.
I can't help you.

315
00:20:43.379 --> 00:20:46.517
-Okay. You know that stuff
sucks. right?

316
00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.586
It -- It tastes like a --
like a friggin' butt.

317
00:20:49.689 --> 00:20:51.586
-Well. I'm sorry to hear
about your experience. sir.

318
00:20:51.689 --> 00:20:54.724
I-I-I personally don't really
care for your tone.

319
00:20:54.827 --> 00:20:56.793
And the active ingredient
is called sodium bicarbonate

320
00:20:56.896 --> 00:20:58.551
and I think it --
it rocks. actually.

321
00:20:58.655 --> 00:21:03.724
so. good night.

322
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.896
Hi. this is Will.

323
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Who is this?

324
00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.517
-I just want to make sure

325
00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.896
that you haven't

326
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.241
done anything stupid.

327
00:21:15.344 --> 00:21:17.689
You haven't tried to call

328
00:21:17.793 --> 00:21:19.000
Amy. have you?

329
00:21:19.103 --> 00:21:20.724
-No!
-Okay.

330
00:21:20.827 --> 00:21:21.862
-Or. well. once.

331
00:21:21.965 --> 00:21:23.206
-Oh!
-Oh. I left her

332
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.827
a voicemail. and I might've
been crying.

333
00:21:24.931 --> 00:21:27.620
-Will.
you have to be prepared

334
00:21:27.724 --> 00:21:29.034
that you might not get her back.

335
00:21:29.137 --> 00:21:31.034
-I-I know.

336
00:21:31.137 --> 00:21:33.275
I-I know that.

337
00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:35.620
-I don't think you do.

338
00:21:35.724 --> 00:21:36.655
-You know. she thinks I'm

339
00:21:36.758 --> 00:21:38.344
stalling...

340
00:21:38.448 --> 00:21:40.655
...but it's kind of hard
to figure out your whole life

341
00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:41.896
all of a sudden. you know?

342
00:21:44.275 --> 00:21:46.068
We're supposed to be a team.

343
00:21:46.172 --> 00:21:47.310
-Well. are you?

344
00:21:47.413 --> 00:21:49.206
-No.
She. uh. dumped me.

345
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:52.482
-Stalling.
Are you stalling?

346
00:21:54.793 --> 00:21:57.275
-No...man.

347
00:21:57.379 --> 00:21:58.689
-You do

348
00:21:58.793 --> 00:21:59.827
that weird voice when you're

349
00:21:59.931 --> 00:22:02.896
being deceptive.
-No...I don't!

350
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.310
-There it is again.

351
00:22:04.413 --> 00:22:06.448
-Agh! I don't have
to listen to you!

352
00:22:06.551 --> 00:22:07.206
You're not my dad!

353
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.137
Even though you're

354
00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:11.758
a boring lawyer guy.

355
00:22:11.862 --> 00:22:12.862
like my dad.
-Okay.

356
00:22:12.965 --> 00:22:14.827
Your dad is a tax attorney

357
00:22:14.931 --> 00:22:17.103
and one of my personal
heroes. so.

358
00:22:17.206 --> 00:22:18.931
thank you for the compliment.
actually.

359
00:22:19.034 --> 00:22:21.275
-Wow.
-I'm just worried about you.

360
00:22:21.379 --> 00:22:25.034
I don't think you're
in a good headspace right now

361
00:22:25.137 --> 00:22:26.482
and you need a friend.

362
00:22:26.586 --> 00:22:27.379
-Uh...

363
00:22:27.482 --> 00:22:30.310
my headset's gone.
-Okay.

364
00:22:30.413 --> 00:22:32.241
-Yeah. that's good.
You got to unplug sometimes.

365
00:22:32.344 --> 00:22:36.517
-No. it -- it was here.
and now it's. like --

366
00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.931
it's completely gone.
I -- I gotta go.

367
00:22:39.034 --> 00:22:40.448
And I'm not stalling.

368
00:22:40.551 --> 00:22:42.379
I worked on the dresser today
and exercised.

369
00:22:42.482 --> 00:22:44.206
And you can tell Amy that.

370
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.000
I'm really trying here.
Patrick.

371
00:22:47.103 --> 00:22:50.689
I am. So could you just
tell her that. please?

372
00:22:50.793 --> 00:22:53.620
-Will --
-Oh. my God. Fine. Don't.

373
00:22:53.724 --> 00:22:57.000
I don't care.

374
00:23:16.862 --> 00:23:23.448
-Will...

375
00:23:23.551 --> 00:23:28.482
My sacrifice.

376
00:23:33.172 --> 00:23:35.413
-Aah!

377
00:24:53.103 --> 00:24:55.965
-Shh! Shh!

378
00:24:56.068 --> 00:24:58.413
He'll hear you.

379
00:25:01.482 --> 00:25:02.413
-Hello?

380
00:25:02.517 --> 00:25:04.344
-He won't take him.
-Yes. he will.

381
00:25:04.448 --> 00:25:05.827
Yes. he will.

382
00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:09.896
-No. we'll do what he wants.
but he doesn't want him.

383
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.344
Soul's too weak.

384
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:18.517
-Shh!
-Do nothing.

385
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.724
-He's coming.
We'll do what he wants.

386
00:25:21.827 --> 00:25:23.310
But he doesn't want him.

387
00:25:23.413 --> 00:25:25.758
-He won't take him.
-Yes. he will.

388
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.862
Son of a --

389
00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:50.034
Oh.

390
00:25:51.275 --> 00:25:54.103
It's just a creaky house.
New pipes are settling in.

391
00:25:54.206 --> 00:25:56.448
like the family said
they would be.

392
00:25:56.551 --> 00:26:02.482
A rat moved my headset.
and creepy stuff can't be creepy

393
00:26:02.586 --> 00:26:05.620
if it's not
in the creepy basement.

394
00:26:22.379 --> 00:26:24.655
And the electricity
is just faulty.

395
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.448
It's creaky. It's fine.
It's okay.

396
00:26:30.551 --> 00:26:32.586
I'm not scared.

397
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.103
Okay.

398
00:26:38.206 --> 00:26:41.275
We got to. uh.
try to get some sleep now.

399
00:26:41.379 --> 00:26:42.689
Okay?

400
00:26:47.379 --> 00:26:48.862
Ohh! Ohh!

401
00:26:51.034 --> 00:26:52.586
Oh. God.

402
00:26:52.689 --> 00:26:54.344
Ohh!

403
00:27:35.379 --> 00:27:39.965
Ohh!

404
00:28:19.517 --> 00:28:21.482
Hmm.

405
00:28:31.413 --> 00:28:33.827
-Are you sure you weren't drunk
when you did that?

406
00:28:33.931 --> 00:28:36.896
-No. no. I would never bake
a cake with the icing on it.

407
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.275
It would melt.
-Look. I --

408
00:28:39.379 --> 00:28:42.620
I know that you're trying
to prove yourself

409
00:28:42.724 --> 00:28:44.724
or find yourself or something.

410
00:28:44.827 --> 00:28:47.103
I-I just don't think it's
a good idea for you to be --

411
00:28:47.206 --> 00:28:49.379
Will. what are you doing?!
God!

412
00:28:49.482 --> 00:28:50.931
Doesn't taste
like one of my cakes. either.

413
00:28:51.034 --> 00:28:52.379
That could have poison in it!

414
00:28:52.482 --> 00:28:54.862
Or human blood or something.

415
00:28:54.965 --> 00:28:56.689
-You just don't like cake.
-I like cake.

416
00:28:56.793 --> 00:28:58.310
It's just sugar rots your mouth.

417
00:28:58.413 --> 00:29:02.655
and I don't know why you'd want
to do that to your body.

418
00:29:02.758 --> 00:29:03.827
I'm --
I'm calling the cops.

419
00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:05.241
No. don't ca--
It's fine.

420
00:29:05.344 --> 00:29:06.931
What are you gonna say?
A yummy. scary cake

421
00:29:07.034 --> 00:29:09.275
just showed up in the kitchen?

422
00:29:09.379 --> 00:29:11.551
-Yeah.
-What if it's --

423
00:29:11.655 --> 00:29:14.689
What if it's Amy saying
she wants to get back together?

424
00:29:17.068 --> 00:29:21.103
-You think that Amy
broke into your house

425
00:29:21.206 --> 00:29:25.517
and wrote. "I will
have your soul" on a cake?

426
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.689
-I think it's romantic.

427
00:29:27.793 --> 00:29:29.758
-Oh. my God. Will.
Come on!

428
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.586
-Well. thanks again for these.

429
00:29:34.689 --> 00:29:38.241
but you absolutely should
not have called us.

430
00:29:38.344 --> 00:29:40.793
-But there's. um --
-Yeah. the only

431
00:29:40.896 --> 00:29:43.206
unusual activity
is the impressive amount

432
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.034
of cakes you've made.

433
00:29:45.137 --> 00:29:46.551
But if you call us again

434
00:29:46.655 --> 00:29:50.137
and it's not a serious
emergency. you will be fined.

435
00:29:50.241 --> 00:29:52.310
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

436
00:29:55.068 --> 00:29:56.724
This is insane.

437
00:29:56.827 --> 00:29:58.068
Someone clearly broke in.

438
00:29:58.172 --> 00:29:59.931
-Let's just --
Let's call Amy.

439
00:30:00.034 --> 00:30:02.206
let her explain.
-Amy didn't make the cake.

440
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.103
-Okay. But she's the only other
person that knows I'm here

441
00:30:04.206 --> 00:30:06.931
besides you. you know?
And I know Amy.

442
00:30:07.034 --> 00:30:08.344
-Except she dumped you.

443
00:30:14.689 --> 00:30:17.655
Sorry. but...
I just --

444
00:30:17.758 --> 00:30:21.034
-No. don't you have
a boring day job to get to?

445
00:30:21.137 --> 00:30:22.931
Really?
Just -- Just go.

446
00:30:43.034 --> 00:30:44.896
-Loser.

447
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.344
Not good enough.

448
00:31:04.827 --> 00:31:07.344
-Patrick?

449
00:31:07.448 --> 00:31:08.758
Nice family?

450
00:31:10.965 --> 00:31:12.379
Amy?

451
00:31:15.517 --> 00:31:16.724
It's an old house.

452
00:31:16.827 --> 00:31:19.344
Old houses have drafts.

453
00:31:21.724 --> 00:31:24.379
Drafts that can move chairs.

454
00:31:24.482 --> 00:31:28.034
Yes. I've seen it
in -- in movies.

455
00:31:28.137 --> 00:31:30.310
Scary movies.

456
00:31:35.517 --> 00:31:41.482
You are worthless.

457
00:31:54.965 --> 00:31:57.000
-Huh?!

458
00:32:05.379 --> 00:32:06.896
It's fine.

459
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.137
It's fine.

460
00:32:09.241 --> 00:32:10.931
-Let's get ready to start

461
00:32:11.034 --> 00:32:13.586
those stair climbs.
Limber up.

462
00:32:15.586 --> 00:32:17.310
Come on. Don't hesitate.

463
00:32:17.413 --> 00:32:18.931
Get moving.

464
00:32:23.758 --> 00:32:26.310
Ready?
And let's climb!

465
00:32:30.413 --> 00:32:33.000
Are you at the top yet?

466
00:32:33.103 --> 00:32:34.586
Great!
Now turn around.

467
00:32:34.689 --> 00:32:38.241
Are you at the bottom yet?
Now let's go back up.

468
00:32:38.344 --> 00:32:41.551
Are you at the top yet?
Now turn around.

469
00:32:41.655 --> 00:32:45.068
Are you at the bottom?
Now let's go back up.

470
00:32:45.172 --> 00:32:48.655
Are you at the top yet?
Now turn around.

471
00:32:48.758 --> 00:32:50.310
Are you at the bottom?
Great!

472
00:32:50.413 --> 00:32:52.344
Now go into the basement. Will!

473
00:33:05.344 --> 00:33:07.068
-At the bottom? Great!

474
00:33:07.172 --> 00:33:10.413
Now turn around.
Two more! You can do i--

475
00:33:21.344 --> 00:33:22.068
Come on.

476
00:34:22.137 --> 00:34:23.862
That's impossible.

477
00:34:23.965 --> 00:34:26.034
It's impossible.

478
00:34:40.206 --> 00:34:43.448
-Deominous cannot possess
Will's soul.

479
00:34:43.551 --> 00:34:46.827
He must leave and never return.

480
00:34:49.517 --> 00:34:51.827
-Okay.

481
00:35:01.931 --> 00:35:07.137
What?

482
00:35:07.241 --> 00:35:08.758
Nope.

483
00:35:08.862 --> 00:35:11.275
Nope.

484
00:35:21.379 --> 00:35:22.137
-Will?

485
00:35:22.241 --> 00:35:25.000
-Hey!
Hey.

486
00:35:25.103 --> 00:35:29.275
-Were you about to break
into my apartment?

487
00:35:29.379 --> 00:35:31.586
-Uh. I...

488
00:35:31.689 --> 00:35:33.827
...needed to tell you something.
and you didn't answer.

489
00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:36.758
so I thought
you were in trouble.

490
00:35:36.862 --> 00:35:38.620
-What -- What's the emergency?

491
00:35:38.724 --> 00:35:40.137
-Um...

492
00:35:40.241 --> 00:35:45.931
You -- You left your. uh.
quarter with -- with my stuff.

493
00:35:46.034 --> 00:35:47.620
Yeah. I just thought
you might need it

494
00:35:47.724 --> 00:35:51.896
if. um. you need to do laundry

495
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.413
or buy a soda

496
00:35:53.517 --> 00:35:58.068
or play...pinball.

497
00:35:58.172 --> 00:35:59.931
-That's not an emergency.

498
00:36:00.034 --> 00:36:01.896
-Mm.

499
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.724
Totally.

500
00:36:04.827 --> 00:36:07.137
-Uh...

501
00:36:07.241 --> 00:36:09.724
Will. this is Nick.

502
00:36:09.827 --> 00:36:12.793
-Hey.
-Right.

503
00:36:12.896 --> 00:36:15.586
I'll be going then.
and I'll. uh...

504
00:36:15.689 --> 00:36:17.586
I'll see you around.

505
00:36:17.689 --> 00:36:19.448
Unless I die.

506
00:36:19.551 --> 00:36:21.586
Or u-unless he dies.

507
00:36:25.068 --> 00:36:26.206
-Will?
-Yeah.

508
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.000
-Are you okay?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm good.

509
00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:31.034
I. uh -- I'm good.
I'm just gonna go home

510
00:36:31.137 --> 00:36:32.724
to my normal house
and keep having the normal night

511
00:36:32.827 --> 00:36:37.655
I was having until you two
decided to make a weird.

512
00:36:55.241 --> 00:36:59.034
Hey. Uh. so. yeah.
I think I'm just gonna

513
00:36:59.137 --> 00:37:02.896
stay here for a while.

514
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
-Will is not welcome here!

515
00:37:06.103 --> 00:37:07.827
-Apparently. I'm not welcome
anywhere else.

516
00:37:07.931 --> 00:37:10.172
so we're gonna
have to figure it out!

517
00:37:19.655 --> 00:37:21.068
Okay.

518
00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:23.379
I'm gonna go to my room now.

519
00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.034
Yep.

520
00:37:36.965 --> 00:37:38.827
Ohh!

521
00:37:44.931 --> 00:37:46.965
So you're just gonna
stand there?

522
00:37:51.965 --> 00:37:53.344
I want my shirt back.

523
00:37:59.103 --> 00:38:00.379
You know. you're. uh...

524
00:38:00.482 --> 00:38:02.896
You're lucky to be a ghost.

525
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.758
So then you can't fall in love
and be dumped for Nick.

526
00:38:08.862 --> 00:38:11.172
Who's named Nick anyway?

527
00:38:11.275 --> 00:38:14.413
It's --
It's weird. right?

528
00:38:27.068 --> 00:38:28.172
Ohh!

529
00:38:28.275 --> 00:38:30.965
Fine! It's not weird.

530
00:38:31.068 --> 00:38:34.448
He's probably really cool.

531
00:38:34.551 --> 00:38:38.379
Just leave me alone.

532
00:39:15.206 --> 00:39:16.655
I hate you.

533
00:39:23.413 --> 00:39:26.551
-...with over 172 properties
sold this year.

534
00:39:26.655 --> 00:39:31.379
I'm Tim Sellers.
and I will sell your --

535
00:39:31.482 --> 00:39:34.137
-Sorry I wasn't who you needed.

536
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:35.586
I know it's too late now

537
00:39:35.689 --> 00:39:38.586
for you to see
that I'm better than I was.

538
00:39:38.689 --> 00:39:41.344
-It wasn't your fault.

539
00:39:41.448 --> 00:39:45.586
You were just
figuring things out.

540
00:39:45.689 --> 00:39:49.206
Maybe we can...try again?

541
00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:51.758
-Yeah.
-Maybe we can...

542
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.551
-...start over --

543
00:39:57.655 --> 00:39:59.965
-No. no!

544
00:40:00.068 --> 00:40:02.344
-It's too late.

545
00:40:02.448 --> 00:40:04.931
You have Nick now.
-Oh. stupid Nick.

546
00:40:05.034 --> 00:40:09.448
-Forget Nick.
What we had. it was real.

547
00:40:09.551 --> 00:40:11.448
We're connected.

548
00:40:11.551 --> 00:40:13.931
We're meant to end up together.

549
00:40:14.034 --> 00:40:18.586
We're...soul mates.

550
00:40:18.689 --> 00:40:20.517
-No!

551
00:40:22.551 --> 00:40:26.413
-I don't deserve you. Amy.
We both know it.

552
00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:31.103
I'm just a 27-year-old loser

553
00:40:31.206 --> 00:40:33.448
with a minimum-wage
customer-service job.

554
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:37.827
living in someone else's house
with someone else's demons.

555
00:40:37.931 --> 00:40:40.689
-Hey.
-Maybe you're right...

556
00:40:40.793 --> 00:40:42.275
Will.

557
00:40:42.379 --> 00:40:45.068
Maybe you have
no purpose in life after all.

558
00:40:45.172 --> 00:40:48.103
-Shut up.
-And now that I'm gone. too.

559
00:40:48.206 --> 00:40:52.241
how do you even live
with yourself?

560
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:02.034
-Aah!

561
00:41:02.137 --> 00:41:04.758
Fine.
You can watch TV.

562
00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:07.000
I don't care.

563
00:41:17.068 --> 00:41:18.275
Oh!

564
00:41:22.068 --> 00:41:23.793
Oh. God.

565
00:41:45.034 --> 00:41:47.758
You know what?
I don't have to shower.

566
00:42:04.103 --> 00:42:06.034
Hey.

567
00:42:06.137 --> 00:42:10.172
You still in here. ghost boy?

568
00:42:10.275 --> 00:42:12.206
Huh?

569
00:42:15.034 --> 00:42:17.172
I'm not gonna hurt you.

570
00:42:19.137 --> 00:42:21.172
No surprises.

571
00:42:23.896 --> 00:42:25.482
Aha!

572
00:42:25.586 --> 00:42:27.344
Aah!
What?

573
00:42:34.103 --> 00:42:35.482
-What?

574
00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:37.034
I -- I don't understand.

575
00:42:37.137 --> 00:42:38.413
-You must leave.

576
00:42:38.517 --> 00:42:41.689
Will is not the sacrifice
Deominous desires.

577
00:42:41.793 --> 00:42:44.896
Yeah?

578
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.068
Well. why not?
Hmm?

579
00:42:47.172 --> 00:42:48.517
Hey. why don't you
ask this Deominous guy

580
00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.965
just what's so wrong with me?
I'm right here.

581
00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:53.551
Here I am!
Take my soul.

582
00:42:53.655 --> 00:42:55.551
I don't need it.

583
00:43:00.827 --> 00:43:04.482
Um. I'm not here 'cause
I needed you or something.

584
00:43:04.586 --> 00:43:07.379
I just had to. uh. get
out of the house for a while.

585
00:43:07.482 --> 00:43:11.103
-Of course you did. You needed
some human interaction.

586
00:43:11.206 --> 00:43:13.344
-As opposed to the alternative?

587
00:43:13.448 --> 00:43:14.931
-Yeah.

588
00:43:15.034 --> 00:43:17.413
What's. uh. the alternative?

589
00:43:17.517 --> 00:43:20.724
-Let's just say that I am tired
of certain demons

590
00:43:20.827 --> 00:43:25.758
sitting on their high horses.
telling me I'm not good enough.

591
00:43:25.862 --> 00:43:27.206
-Yeah. uh. we all need to listen

592
00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.379
to our inner demons sometimes.
Will.

593
00:43:29.482 --> 00:43:31.448
That's our conscience
telling us that we need

594
00:43:31.551 --> 00:43:33.724
to pay attention
to our well-being.

595
00:43:33.827 --> 00:43:34.931
-Hmm.

596
00:43:35.034 --> 00:43:37.965
-Or when we need
to start moving on.

597
00:43:38.068 --> 00:43:40.275
Hey.

598
00:43:42.206 --> 00:43:44.000
No. What is going on?
-It's good for you.

599
00:43:44.103 --> 00:43:47.000
-Are you setting me up?
-Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

600
00:43:47.103 --> 00:43:48.655
Hey!
-Hi!

601
00:43:48.758 --> 00:43:49.827
-How's it going?
-Good. good.

602
00:43:49.931 --> 00:43:51.241
-There you go.
-Oh. thank you.

603
00:43:51.344 --> 00:43:54.862
-Will. this is Aimee. from work.

604
00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:56.758
-Hi.

605
00:43:56.862 --> 00:43:59.724
-Hi.
-Amy is spelled with two E's.

606
00:43:59.827 --> 00:44:01.241
And an I.

607
00:44:01.344 --> 00:44:03.793
So it's totally different.

608
00:44:03.896 --> 00:44:06.172
Than the conventional spelling.

609
00:44:06.275 --> 00:44:08.896
-Um. Patrick here has told me

610
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.482
so many wonderful things
about you.

611
00:44:10.586 --> 00:44:12.896
He said that -- that you two
have been friends

612
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.241
since you were kids...
-Mm.

613
00:44:14.344 --> 00:44:15.793
-...which is pretty cute.
-Yeah.

614
00:44:15.896 --> 00:44:17.724
Well. maybe.
Just a couple of kids.

615
00:44:17.827 --> 00:44:19.965
-Yeah.

616
00:44:20.068 --> 00:44:22.482
-Ha.

617
00:44:22.586 --> 00:44:26.137
You know. craziest thing
about Patrick

618
00:44:26.241 --> 00:44:29.482
is he got a cavity once.

619
00:44:29.586 --> 00:44:33.275
-It wasn't just a cavity.
The dentist said that my tooth

620
00:44:33.379 --> 00:44:37.068
was so rotten
that I could have died.

621
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.793
-Wow.
Um...yeah.

622
00:44:42.896 --> 00:44:47.172
And it's also when you stopped
eating sugar and cake.

623
00:44:47.275 --> 00:44:50.241
And it's also when
you kind of stopped being fun.

624
00:44:50.344 --> 00:44:52.000
-Can you just be normal
for 5 seconds

625
00:44:52.103 --> 00:44:54.275
in front of Aimee. please?
-Oh. I'm -- I'm sorry

626
00:44:54.379 --> 00:44:57.275
that I'm not being normal
like Patrick.

627
00:44:57.379 --> 00:45:00.655
Aimee -- Am I pronouncing
that right. by the way?

628
00:45:00.758 --> 00:45:03.241
-It's just Aimee.
-Hmm.

629
00:45:03.344 --> 00:45:06.034
Well. there are --
There are two E's.

630
00:45:06.137 --> 00:45:09.310
-There are.
-Oh. God.

631
00:45:09.413 --> 00:45:10.620
You know what?
I actually --

632
00:45:10.724 --> 00:45:12.413
I have a really big
accounting meeting

633
00:45:12.517 --> 00:45:14.413
kind of early in the morning.
so...

634
00:45:14.517 --> 00:45:16.655
-That sounds interesting.
doesn't it. Will?

635
00:45:16.758 --> 00:45:18.344
-Um...
-Yeah. it's not actually

636
00:45:18.448 --> 00:45:19.551
that exciting.

637
00:45:19.655 --> 00:45:22.172
It's just we had
a minor security breach. so...

638
00:45:22.275 --> 00:45:25.310
-Oh. Will actually just had
a pretty scary break-in.

639
00:45:25.413 --> 00:45:27.413
Why don't you
tell her about that

640
00:45:27.517 --> 00:45:30.827
and. uh. how you were all alone
in this big house. and it's --

641
00:45:30.931 --> 00:45:34.241
-Haunted.
It's super haunted.

642
00:45:34.344 --> 00:45:36.172
Come on. Will.

643
00:45:36.275 --> 00:45:38.172
Tell her the real story.

644
00:45:38.275 --> 00:45:40.103
-That's the real --
That's the real story.

645
00:45:40.206 --> 00:45:42.758
-Oh. shit.
-It's super haunted.

646
00:45:42.862 --> 00:45:45.862
Ghosts...everywhere.

647
00:45:45.965 --> 00:45:47.275
I can't go anywhere.
I have nowhere to go

648
00:45:47.379 --> 00:45:49.206
because Amy --
Oh. sorry.

649
00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:50.689
That's my ex-girlfriend.

650
00:45:50.793 --> 00:45:52.517
And I bet you Patrick
didn't want to bring her up

651
00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.931
because he thought
I'd be weird about it.

652
00:45:55.034 --> 00:45:56.965
but I don't think
I'm being weird. you know?

653
00:45:57.068 --> 00:45:58.551
Am I being weird?

654
00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:00.896
-No. no. no! It's -- It's fine.
-Yeah. I don't think --

655
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.172
It's fine.
-Yeah.

656
00:46:03.275 --> 00:46:05.000
Mm.

657
00:46:05.103 --> 00:46:06.724
There's no alcohol in that.

658
00:46:06.827 --> 00:46:11.172
but I don't have anywhere else
to go because Amy dumped me.

659
00:46:11.275 --> 00:46:12.241
Hmm.

660
00:46:12.344 --> 00:46:14.793
And I can't live with Patrick
because.

661
00:46:14.896 --> 00:46:16.413
unlike me. he has a life.

662
00:46:16.517 --> 00:46:19.275
-Okay. Just because I have
a steady income and a mortgage

663
00:46:19.379 --> 00:46:22.413
and I do Taekwondo
on Mondays and Thursdays --

664
00:46:22.517 --> 00:46:24.758
oldest in the class --
-Oh!

665
00:46:24.862 --> 00:46:26.448
doesn't mean I have a life.

666
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:28.068
-The worst part is.

667
00:46:28.172 --> 00:46:30.344
the ghosts.
they don't want my soul.

668
00:46:30.448 --> 00:46:32.000
They must have
tried it on and said.

669
00:46:32.103 --> 00:46:33.413
"This one sucks." you know?

670
00:46:36.758 --> 00:46:38.172
-Oh!
Oh. no. no. no. no. no.

671
00:46:38.275 --> 00:46:41.034
It's okay. it's okay.
Uh. I'm sure that any ghost

672
00:46:41.137 --> 00:46:44.000
would be lucky
to have your soul.

673
00:46:44.103 --> 00:46:45.379
Right?
I mean. they just don't know

674
00:46:45.482 --> 00:46:47.793
what they're missing out on.

675
00:46:47.896 --> 00:46:49.344
-Really?
-Yeah.

676
00:46:49.448 --> 00:46:50.931
-Thank you.
Thank you. Aimee.

677
00:46:51.034 --> 00:46:52.413
That's really nice.
-I'm sorry.

678
00:46:52.517 --> 00:46:56.931
I didn't know
anything about...that.

679
00:46:57.034 --> 00:46:59.206
-It's okay.
Um...

680
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:02.206
Yeah.
Actually. in college.

681
00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:06.517
I used to cleanse houses
of all sorts of...

682
00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:10.379
spirits and negative energies
and stuff.

683
00:47:10.482 --> 00:47:11.931
-Really?
-Really?

684
00:47:12.034 --> 00:47:15.103
-Aimee. now. listen.
I need a cleansing.

685
00:47:15.206 --> 00:47:16.896
I need it tonight
because I don't know

686
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.724
how much longer I can take this.

687
00:47:18.827 --> 00:47:21.482
Please.
Can you help me?

688
00:47:23.724 --> 00:47:27.896
Help me. please.

689
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.482
Please.

690
00:47:32.862 --> 00:47:34.862
Okay.
This is it.

691
00:47:34.965 --> 00:47:37.827
Sometimes they. uh.
start being annoying

692
00:47:37.931 --> 00:47:39.310
around 3:15 in the morning.

693
00:47:39.413 --> 00:47:43.034
but other days. they
just kind of start whenever.

694
00:47:43.137 --> 00:47:44.344
-There are no ghosts.

695
00:47:44.448 --> 00:47:46.068
Oh.

696
00:47:46.172 --> 00:47:49.344
Oh. I'm definitely
sensing something.

697
00:47:49.448 --> 00:47:52.379
Um...
-Is it that ghost boy?

698
00:47:52.482 --> 00:47:54.413
He's really starting
to piss me off.

699
00:47:56.068 --> 00:47:58.517
-Mm. It's coming from
the basement.

700
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.137
-Ooh. yeah
He likes to hide in there.

701
00:48:00.241 --> 00:48:03.137
-Yeah. Okay.
And...

702
00:48:03.241 --> 00:48:05.413
Is there a girl's room?
Is there a little girl?

703
00:48:05.517 --> 00:48:07.172
-Yeah.
there was a little girl. yes.

704
00:48:07.275 --> 00:48:08.413
-O-Okay. Yeah. sure.

705
00:48:08.517 --> 00:48:10.482
There was a little girl
that lived here.

706
00:48:10.586 --> 00:48:13.655
That's a great guess.
But there are no ghosts.

707
00:48:13.758 --> 00:48:15.103
-Mm.

708
00:48:15.206 --> 00:48:17.448
-If you're not gonna help.
just go home. okay?

709
00:48:17.551 --> 00:48:20.068
'Cause I'm tired of these ghosts
jumping out of nowhere

710
00:48:20.172 --> 00:48:21.862
and demanding sacrifices

711
00:48:21.965 --> 00:48:25.689
and playing piano
better than me. Okay?

712
00:48:25.793 --> 00:48:26.827
I'm gonna end it.

713
00:48:26.931 --> 00:48:30.034
Or. well.
Aimee is gonna end it.

714
00:48:30.137 --> 00:48:32.000
Yeah.
Right?

715
00:48:32.103 --> 00:48:33.103
-Yeah.
-Yes. Good.

716
00:48:33.206 --> 00:48:34.793
-Yeah. Okay.

717
00:48:36.758 --> 00:48:39.068
Do you have any sage?
Or salt.

718
00:48:39.172 --> 00:48:40.827
I'm gonna need sage and salt.

719
00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:43.413
Yeah. I --
Well. I do.

720
00:48:43.517 --> 00:48:45.517
I was gonna use those
for some scones tomorrow --

721
00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.620
-Stalling.
-I'm not stalling. Shut up.

722
00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:48.862
-No. Okay.
We are gonna do

723
00:48:48.965 --> 00:48:50.241
the cleansing
in the girl's room.

724
00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:52.689
I need you to get the sage
and the salt.

725
00:48:52.793 --> 00:48:55.034
-Yes.

726
00:48:55.137 --> 00:48:59.896
So. are you gonna use
all of that. or...?

727
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.310
It's cool. I can get more.

728
00:49:01.413 --> 00:49:05.068
-Okay. good.

729
00:49:05.172 --> 00:49:07.896
-Uh. what -- what kind is it?

730
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.413
-No. no.
-So. Aimee...

731
00:49:10.517 --> 00:49:13.517
how did you learn
how to do cleansings. exactly?

732
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:17.413
-My roommate in college
was really into crystals

733
00:49:17.517 --> 00:49:20.931
and palm readings.
and. I mean. it paid the bills.

734
00:49:21.034 --> 00:49:23.241
-So. why do you work
with Patrick. then.

735
00:49:23.344 --> 00:49:26.517
if you can make money
doing really cool ghost stuff?

736
00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.448
-Uh. we lost control
during a seance.

737
00:49:28.551 --> 00:49:32.172
and that's when I decided to...

738
00:49:32.275 --> 00:49:34.448
take a more conventional path
with my life.

739
00:49:34.551 --> 00:49:35.517
-Oh.

740
00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.310
-What happens
when you lose control?

741
00:49:40.413 --> 00:49:44.586
-Well. spirits take over
the house. wreak havoc.

742
00:49:44.689 --> 00:49:45.965
-Oh.
-That's not so bad.

743
00:49:46.068 --> 00:49:48.379
I mean. my spirits
are doing that anyways.

744
00:49:48.482 --> 00:49:50.344
-They will burn demonic symbols
into your flesh.

745
00:49:50.448 --> 00:49:53.965
curse you. blind you.
possess you.

746
00:49:54.068 --> 00:49:56.034
turn you against
your loved ones.

747
00:49:56.137 --> 00:49:58.172
Yeah. it can get pretty dark.

748
00:49:58.275 --> 00:50:00.448
I promised myself
that I would never do it again.

749
00:50:00.551 --> 00:50:03.310
-Then. uh. what are we doing
right now. exactly?

750
00:50:03.413 --> 00:50:04.827
-Oh. no. this isn't a seance.

751
00:50:04.931 --> 00:50:07.758
This is just a cleansing.
Totally safe.

752
00:50:07.862 --> 00:50:09.379
Okay?
-Yeah. totally.

753
00:50:09.482 --> 00:50:11.206
Hey. uh.
Will. just one second?

754
00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:14.206
-What?
-Hey. uh...

755
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:16.206
remember what I said
about inner demons. Will?

756
00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:18.172
You can't hide
from them forever.

757
00:50:18.275 --> 00:50:21.068
And now you're trying to get
Aimee from accounting into this.

758
00:50:21.172 --> 00:50:23.206
She's the only other person
at work who likes

759
00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:25.137
that weird deli by the office.
Okay?

760
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:26.620
I can't lose my lunch. buddy.
I can't.

761
00:50:26.724 --> 00:50:30.310
-Okay. okay.
Hey. if you like her so much.

762
00:50:30.413 --> 00:50:33.034
why don't you ask her out?

763
00:50:35.862 --> 00:50:37.758
-Come on.

764
00:50:37.862 --> 00:50:40.034
Hold my hand.

765
00:50:41.896 --> 00:50:45.379
-O-o-o-o-oh. spirits!

766
00:50:45.482 --> 00:50:46.655
-Oh. God.

767
00:50:46.758 --> 00:50:49.793
-You must release yourself

768
00:50:49.896 --> 00:50:53.068
from the confines of this house.

769
00:50:53.172 --> 00:50:57.310
You are not welcome.

770
00:50:57.413 --> 00:50:58.344
-Mm.

771
00:50:58.448 --> 00:51:00.965
Yay! You did it.
I think they're gone.

772
00:51:01.068 --> 00:51:02.482
Let's go back to the bar
to celebrate.

773
00:51:02.586 --> 00:51:03.862
-Oh. no. no.
Unh-unh.

774
00:51:03.965 --> 00:51:07.724
The spirits have heard me.
but they haven't left yet.

775
00:51:10.172 --> 00:51:13.965
O-o-o-o-oh. spirits.

776
00:51:14.068 --> 00:51:17.103
You are no longer of this world.

777
00:51:17.206 --> 00:51:20.034
You must release yourself
from the confines

778
00:51:20.137 --> 00:51:22.137
of this earthly home.

779
00:51:22.241 --> 00:51:24.896
It belongs to Will...

780
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.655
server of toothpaste customers.

781
00:51:28.758 --> 00:51:32.379
Baker of baked goods.

782
00:51:32.482 --> 00:51:33.517
And...

783
00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:35.275
-You know.
I'm actually still kind of

784
00:51:35.379 --> 00:51:37.034
trying to figure that out.
We can -- We can skip this part.

785
00:51:37.137 --> 00:51:38.517
But thank you.
You're doing great.

786
00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:42.862
-Okay. Anyway. spirits.
it belongs to the living.

787
00:51:42.965 --> 00:51:44.620
and I cast you out!

788
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.206
-Uh...

789
00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:55.310
There's gotta
be a window open or...

790
00:51:55.413 --> 00:51:57.862
something.
I'll go close it.

791
00:52:00.068 --> 00:52:01.620
-There's a demon in this house.

792
00:52:01.724 --> 00:52:03.551
My cleansing was for...

793
00:52:03.655 --> 00:52:06.000
It was for ghosts.

794
00:52:06.103 --> 00:52:07.862
Like. the spirits
haven't moved on.

795
00:52:07.965 --> 00:52:09.965
-How different can it be.
you know?

796
00:52:11.551 --> 00:52:13.482
-Whoa! Oh! Aimee!
Aimee? Aimee?

797
00:52:13.586 --> 00:52:16.310
Uh...be okay.

798
00:52:16.413 --> 00:52:19.724
Patrick!

799
00:52:19.827 --> 00:52:21.793
Uh. okay.
Don't move.

800
00:52:21.896 --> 00:52:23.793
Stay right here.
I'll be back.

801
00:52:33.896 --> 00:52:34.862
Patrick?

802
00:52:48.758 --> 00:52:50.793
Patrick?

803
00:52:50.896 --> 00:52:52.344
Aimee's passed out
in the other room.

804
00:52:52.448 --> 00:52:55.586
We gotta go. We got to get her
to a hospital. like. now.

805
00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:02.000
-You know. Deominous
wanted Will to leave.

806
00:53:02.103 --> 00:53:05.896
But Will didn't listen.

807
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.344
Will brought his friends.

808
00:53:08.448 --> 00:53:11.413
Friends Deominous could possess.

809
00:53:11.517 --> 00:53:15.586
-Deominous. seriously.
Patrick is a nerd.

810
00:53:15.689 --> 00:53:16.655
You don't want him.

811
00:53:16.758 --> 00:53:19.517
-Deominous likes nerds!

812
00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.517
-Hey!

813
00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:24.344
Deominous. open the door!

814
00:53:26.655 --> 00:53:28.586
Patrick?!

815
00:53:30.655 --> 00:53:32.620
Patrick?

816
00:53:39.448 --> 00:53:40.827
Come on!

817
00:53:46.241 --> 00:53:48.586
Not this time. ghost.

818
00:53:48.689 --> 00:53:50.413
Unh!

819
00:53:57.724 --> 00:53:59.482
I hate those stairs.

820
00:54:05.793 --> 00:54:07.620
Patrick?

821
00:54:07.724 --> 00:54:09.000
Or Deominous?

822
00:54:11.586 --> 00:54:14.172
Patrick...

823
00:54:14.275 --> 00:54:17.827
your best human friend.

824
00:54:17.931 --> 00:54:19.827
-Okay. Patrick.

825
00:54:19.931 --> 00:54:22.068
Aimee needs our help. okay?
We gotta get her out of here.

826
00:54:22.172 --> 00:54:24.310
And you're the responsible one.
remember?

827
00:54:24.413 --> 00:54:25.689
You're the one always telling me

828
00:54:25.793 --> 00:54:29.241
to do the right thing
over the easy thing.

829
00:54:29.344 --> 00:54:31.965
-I don't think I want
to do that any more.

830
00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:34.896
I think I want
to let the lady suffer.

831
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:38.758
Hang out with Deominous instead.

832
00:54:38.862 --> 00:54:42.517
That sounds fun.

833
00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:44.068
-It --
Yeah. that --

834
00:54:44.172 --> 00:54:46.620
I think that could be...
All right.

835
00:54:46.724 --> 00:54:48.034
Yeah. we'll just do that.

836
00:54:48.137 --> 00:54:49.448
No. we're not gonna do that!

837
00:54:51.241 --> 00:54:54.275
Get off me!

838
00:54:54.379 --> 00:54:56.344
You smell really bad.

839
00:54:56.448 --> 00:54:59.862
-And you are weak.
Patrick works out.

840
00:54:59.965 --> 00:55:01.172
-I know!

841
00:55:01.275 --> 00:55:02.620
No. no!
Please. please. please!

842
00:55:02.724 --> 00:55:03.620
Please. don't!
No. no --

843
00:55:03.724 --> 00:55:04.793
Aah!

844
00:55:07.413 --> 00:55:11.586
Your brittle bones
are no match for Deominous.

845
00:55:12.896 --> 00:55:14.275
-Aah!

846
00:55:16.275 --> 00:55:18.206
Patrick?

847
00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:20.689
-Hey. demon!
You're not of this world.

848
00:55:20.793 --> 00:55:24.482
You must release your essence
from the confines of the living!

849
00:55:24.586 --> 00:55:25.310
Patrick!

850
00:55:25.413 --> 00:55:28.137
I cast you out!
-Unh!

851
00:55:35.862 --> 00:55:38.620
-Nice.
-See that?

852
00:55:38.724 --> 00:55:40.448
That's how you cast out a demon.

853
00:55:43.413 --> 00:55:46.482
It's totally different.

854
00:55:46.586 --> 00:55:48.000
You okay?

855
00:55:48.103 --> 00:55:49.862
-Good.

856
00:55:49.965 --> 00:55:51.448
I'm gonna sit down.

857
00:55:52.551 --> 00:55:54.862
Ohh.

858
00:55:59.862 --> 00:56:01.482
-We're gonna go to the hospital.
and you're gonna come back

859
00:56:01.586 --> 00:56:03.862
and live with me for a while.
-What?

860
00:56:03.965 --> 00:56:06.827
Aimee fixed it.
She...saved us.

861
00:56:06.931 --> 00:56:08.862
I'm not gonna live with you.

862
00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:12.724
-You're not saying you want
to come back and live here?

863
00:56:12.827 --> 00:56:15.413
-You know. you -- you and Amy
have been on my case for years

864
00:56:15.517 --> 00:56:17.896
about what I'm supposed to do
with my life.

865
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.068
This might be it.

866
00:56:19.172 --> 00:56:21.551
-What is "it." exactly?

867
00:56:21.655 --> 00:56:26.172
-Guard the world from demons
and -- and stay here

868
00:56:26.275 --> 00:56:28.379
and keep him from. you know.
getting out of the house.

869
00:56:28.482 --> 00:56:29.620
-Are you listening
to yourself?

870
00:56:29.724 --> 00:56:31.413
-Guys. stop!

871
00:56:31.517 --> 00:56:33.827
This is really
dangerous territory.

872
00:56:33.931 --> 00:56:36.655
I don't know how strong
that demon is.

873
00:56:36.758 --> 00:56:38.482
It could come right back.

874
00:56:38.586 --> 00:56:39.793
-Well. then I'll just

875
00:56:39.896 --> 00:56:42.068
cast it out again. you know?

876
00:56:42.172 --> 00:56:45.275
Like you did.
Like. "Begone. demon!

877
00:56:45.379 --> 00:56:47.310
Get out of my house!"

878
00:56:47.413 --> 00:56:49.827
It's paraphrasing.
but it's pretty spot on. right?

879
00:56:49.931 --> 00:56:53.517
-No. what I'm saying. Will.
is that it could come back

880
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:55.310
and it could
try to kill someone.

881
00:56:55.413 --> 00:56:58.310
That demon is looking
for a sacrifice to take to Hell.

882
00:56:58.413 --> 00:57:01.827
-Oh. well. doesn't want me.

883
00:57:01.931 --> 00:57:05.689
And no one's gonna be here
except me.

884
00:57:05.793 --> 00:57:10.724
-Okay. So you're just gonna
avoid everyone else forever?

885
00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:12.896
That's your big life plan?

886
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.275
-Yeah. Patrick. that's the plan.

887
00:57:15.379 --> 00:57:19.137
As long as that nice family
let me stay here. sure.

888
00:57:19.241 --> 00:57:22.310
Why not? I mean. what else
do I have going on for me?

889
00:57:25.517 --> 00:57:26.379
-Okay.

890
00:57:26.482 --> 00:57:28.103
Just come to the hospital
with us.

891
00:57:28.206 --> 00:57:30.827
and then. you can do
whatever you want.

892
00:57:30.931 --> 00:57:33.103
I'm not gonna stop you.
But. dude.

893
00:57:33.206 --> 00:57:35.896
I can see the bone sticking
out of your arm right now.

894
00:57:41.448 --> 00:57:43.551
-Okay. You good?

895
00:57:57.034 --> 00:57:58.620
-Amy?

896
00:57:58.724 --> 00:58:00.620
-Hey.

897
00:58:00.724 --> 00:58:02.758
-Hey.

898
00:58:05.655 --> 00:58:07.344
What are you doing?
-This is weird.

899
00:58:07.448 --> 00:58:13.413
I'm like...holding a rock.
and you're broken.

900
00:58:15.206 --> 00:58:18.620
-Oh. I don't know
if I would say it like that.

901
00:58:18.724 --> 00:58:21.206
-No. I meant your arm is broken.

902
00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:23.827
-Yeah.
Oh. yeah.

903
00:58:23.931 --> 00:58:26.448
-So it's true.

904
00:58:26.551 --> 00:58:28.448
-What did you hear?

905
00:58:28.551 --> 00:58:32.103
-Patrick just told me
that you were in an accident

906
00:58:32.206 --> 00:58:35.068
and that you're in the hospital.

907
00:58:35.172 --> 00:58:36.310
-Yeah.
-I tried to call you.

908
00:58:36.413 --> 00:58:40.586
but. um. you didn't answer.
and I...

909
00:58:40.689 --> 00:58:44.068
Well. I just...

910
00:58:44.172 --> 00:58:45.793
Could I come inside?

911
00:58:45.896 --> 00:58:47.931
-Sure.
Sure. Yeah. Oh. yeah.

912
00:58:48.034 --> 00:58:49.448
Uh...

913
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:54.034
Um...

914
00:58:54.137 --> 00:58:55.655
I'm sorry.

915
00:58:55.758 --> 00:58:57.586
Actually. I don't know
if it's a good idea.

916
00:58:57.689 --> 00:58:59.413
-Yeah. right.

917
00:59:01.448 --> 00:59:03.517
Well. I'm glad that you're okay.

918
00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:06.551
-Thanks for -- for coming.
-Yeah.

919
00:59:06.655 --> 00:59:08.689
Okay.

920
00:59:18.517 --> 00:59:19.862
-Cast out...

921
00:59:25.137 --> 00:59:26.896
Let's open this house.

922
00:59:29.172 --> 00:59:30.862
Oh. my God.

923
00:59:30.965 --> 00:59:32.586
Hey.
Oh.

924
00:59:32.689 --> 00:59:34.827
Uh...

925
00:59:34.931 --> 00:59:36.896
I'm sorry.
I was -- I was gonna get it.

926
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.137
It's just. the cast is. um...

927
00:59:39.241 --> 00:59:41.034
I'm still figuring it out.
-Right.

928
00:59:41.137 --> 00:59:43.000
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Here.

929
00:59:45.241 --> 00:59:47.137
-Uh. wait. Amy.
I'm sorry. It's --

930
00:59:47.241 --> 00:59:49.000
It's too --
It's too dangerous.

931
00:59:49.103 --> 00:59:51.103
-Just -- Just relax. okay?

932
00:59:51.206 --> 00:59:54.551
I'm just here
to check on you -- as a friend.

933
01:00:22.344 --> 01:00:23.793
-So...

934
01:00:26.965 --> 01:00:28.517
-So...

935
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.793
-So. how's Nick?

936
01:00:35.103 --> 01:00:38.310
-Oh. um...

937
01:00:38.413 --> 01:00:40.344
Yeah. we went out
a couple times.

938
01:00:40.448 --> 01:00:42.724
-You're in love. It's okay.
-No. no. no.

939
01:00:42.827 --> 01:00:44.827
Um...

940
01:00:44.931 --> 01:00:46.896
It was fine.
I just -- I --

941
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.655
I didn't really feel it.
you know?

942
01:00:50.758 --> 01:00:54.310
-Oh. yeah.
Yeah.

943
01:00:54.413 --> 01:00:56.758
That's how it goes sometimes.

944
01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:04.241
Have you been seeing anyone?

945
01:01:04.344 --> 01:01:07.586
-Seeing. like. dating
or. like. spirits?

946
01:01:09.965 --> 01:01:13.310
Dating is what you meant.
No. Nope.

947
01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:17.068
-Are you okay?
-What?

948
01:01:17.172 --> 01:01:19.551
-Are you on painkillers?
-What?

949
01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:21.931
No. I mean. yes. a little.

950
01:01:22.034 --> 01:01:23.310
but I'm -- I'm good.

951
01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.931
Nothing's wrong. uh.
and everything is fine.

952
01:01:28.448 --> 01:01:30.103
-Okay.

953
01:01:30.206 --> 01:01:34.551
Well. then...
I should probably go

954
01:01:34.655 --> 01:01:36.379
since you're not in trouble...
-Oh.

955
01:01:36.482 --> 01:01:38.724
-...or anything.
-Uh. wait.

956
01:01:38.827 --> 01:01:42.137
Hey. Amy. wait.

957
01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:44.655
Um. m-maybe...

958
01:01:46.724 --> 01:01:51.000
You know. since we appeared
to actually be alone...

959
01:01:55.103 --> 01:01:56.655
If you wanted to stay.

960
01:01:56.758 --> 01:02:00.965

I need closure.

1007
01:04:53.275 --> 01:04:55.344

Right.

1008
01:04:55.448 --> 01:04:57.379

I am.

And if closure is
what would make you...happy...

1014
01:05:13.551 --> 01:05:16.517
Then...

1015
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.172
-What are you doing?
-Okay. Imagine this.

1016
01:05:19.275 --> 01:05:23.000
We've just bumped
into each other on the street

1017
01:05:23.103 --> 01:05:25.689
and stopped for
a dramatic moment of realization

1018
01:05:25.793 --> 01:05:29.103
that we haven't seen each other
in. like. a while.

1019
01:05:29.206 --> 01:05:30.965
It's like years --
Time has passed. right?

1020
01:05:31.068 --> 01:05:32.448
You know. I've been --
I've been doing things.

1021
01:05:32.551 --> 01:05:35.413
been working on stuff.
finishing up some projects.

1022
01:05:35.517 --> 01:05:39.068
That part actually is true.
by the way.

1023
01:05:39.172 --> 01:05:40.965
But anyways. I'd stop.
and I'd see you.

1024
01:05:41.068 --> 01:05:43.689
and I'd say. "Amy. is that you?"

1025
01:05:43.793 --> 01:05:45.068
-Seriously?
You'd forget what I look like?

1026
01:05:45.172 --> 01:05:47.137
-Well. no. it's be--

1027
01:05:47.241 --> 01:05:48.827
because I'm -- I'm on my way

1028
01:05:48.931 --> 01:05:51.689
to a very important meeting

1029
01:05:51.793 --> 01:05:56.482
for my super profitable
candlemaking. woodworking.

1030
01:05:56.586 --> 01:06:01.137
cake-making business
that I've just been.

1031
01:06:01.241 --> 01:06:04.034
you know. just fully
committed to.

1032
01:06:04.137 --> 01:06:06.241
-Will. please tell me

1033
01:06:06.344 --> 01:06:07.965
you threw away
those disgusting candles.

1034
01:06:08.068 --> 01:06:09.586
They're so bad.

1035
01:06:09.689 --> 01:06:11.482
-I did not.

1036
01:06:11.586 --> 01:06:14.034
I still have them all.

1037
01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:15.620
But. no. then you'd say.

1038
01:06:15.724 --> 01:06:17.965
"Will...

1039
01:06:18.068 --> 01:06:19.172
have you been working out?"

1040
01:06:19.275 --> 01:06:21.862
And I would say. "Yeah.

1041
01:06:21.965 --> 01:06:23.379
Just ran a marathon
this morning."

1042
01:06:23.482 --> 01:06:25.655
-A whole marathon?
-Yeah. a whole marathon.

1043
01:06:25.758 --> 01:06:28.655
You know. because it's just
very important to me

1044
01:06:28.758 --> 01:06:30.241
that I impress you

1045
01:06:30.344 --> 01:06:32.103
with the things that future me

1046
01:06:32.206 --> 01:06:34.241
will do but hasn't done yet.

1047
01:06:34.344 --> 01:06:36.655
-Okay. I know
what I would say next.

1048
01:06:36.758 --> 01:06:39.413
"Oh. Will!
Is that you?"

1049
01:06:39.517 --> 01:06:40.448
-Dang.

1050
01:06:40.551 --> 01:06:42.000
You forgot
what I looked like. too.

1051
01:06:42.103 --> 01:06:44.172
-"I didn't see you
over my grand opening

1052
01:06:44.275 --> 01:06:46.413
for my brand-new business
and my Nobel Prize

1053
01:06:46.517 --> 01:06:49.000
for solving global warming
with the new flavor of ice cream

1054
01:06:49.103 --> 01:06:52.310
I created."

1055
01:06:52.413 --> 01:06:55.068
-How exactly does that work?
-So. it's ice cream.

1056
01:06:55.172 --> 01:06:58.103
-Mm-hmm.
-It recools the Earth.

1057
01:06:58.206 --> 01:06:59.310
-New flavor of ice cream?
-Mm-hmm.

1058
01:06:59.413 --> 01:07:01.206
-And you won a Nobel Prize.
-Mm-hmm.

1059
01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:03.000
-Your stuff's
way cooler than mine.

1060
01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:05.517
-You forgot about my business.
It's okay.

1061
01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:09.448
-Oh. No. I --
I didn't forget about that.

1062
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.655
You're actually gonna do that.

1063
01:07:19.517 --> 01:07:21.551
That was supposed
to make you feel better.

1064
01:07:21.655 --> 01:07:23.034
Um...

1065
01:07:23.137 --> 01:07:24.517
Supposed to make you feel happy.

1066
01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:29.517
I'm -- I'm sorry
if I messed it up.

1067
01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:34.793
-Well. I want you
to be happy. too.

1068
01:07:34.896 --> 01:07:39.275
And if you're happy here...

1069
01:07:39.379 --> 01:07:42.724
with all of your hobbies.

1070
01:07:42.827 --> 01:07:45.000
then I am glad.

1071
01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:46.827
I really am.

1072
01:07:50.724 --> 01:07:53.896
-I'm -- I'm not happy.

1073
01:07:57.034 --> 01:07:58.724
I'm not happy at all.

1074
01:08:02.068 --> 01:08:03.758
Except right now.

1075
01:08:19.206 --> 01:08:22.862
-What's wrong?
-Oh. Nothing.

1076
01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.172
Amy...

1077
01:08:57.275 --> 01:09:01.965
the reason Patrick told you
I was in trouble

1078
01:09:02.068 --> 01:09:07.068
is because there are --
or. were...

1079
01:09:07.172 --> 01:09:11.241
ghosts...
living in the house.

1080
01:09:13.655 --> 01:09:15.379
And a demon.

1081
01:09:17.344 --> 01:09:22.517
Uh. yeah. and I was just gonna.
you know. just stay here

1082
01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:27.241
and guard the world
from any returning evil spirits

1083
01:09:27.344 --> 01:09:32.000
and whatnot. just because...

1084
01:09:32.103 --> 01:09:33.482
I don't know.
I just thought if I was

1085
01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:35.931
living alone.
I might as well be

1086
01:09:36.034 --> 01:09:38.620
doing something productive.

1087
01:09:38.724 --> 01:09:40.310
Right?

1088
01:09:43.448 --> 01:09:45.379
Yeah. uh...

1089
01:09:45.482 --> 01:09:49.586
Anyway. I was just wondering...

1090
01:09:49.689 --> 01:09:52.758
I mean. uh. you know.
it's -- it's like you...

1091
01:09:52.862 --> 01:09:56.172
it's like you said...

1092
01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:58.241
you either feel it or you don't.

1093
01:10:00.758 --> 01:10:02.586
And this feels right to me.

1094
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.620
Does it feel right to you. too?

1095
01:10:08.724 --> 01:10:15.448
-No.

1096
01:10:15.551 --> 01:10:17.275
-Oh.

1097
01:10:19.655 --> 01:10:22.000
Okay.

1098
01:10:22.103 --> 01:10:25.758
-Amy never loved you.

1099
01:10:25.862 --> 01:10:29.172
Amy felt sorry for you.

1100
01:10:29.275 --> 01:10:32.310
And now Amy...

1101
01:10:32.413 --> 01:10:35.724
is mine.

1102
01:10:35.827 --> 01:10:36.758
-Aah!

1103
01:10:36.862 --> 01:10:37.896
No? Okay.

1104
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I know. I know.
I can do it.

1105
01:10:39.103 --> 01:10:43.344
Okay.
Hey. demon. I...

1106
01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:44.793
You know. it's not cool for you

1107
01:10:44.896 --> 01:10:46.965
to take living
people's bodies. man.

1108
01:10:47.068 --> 01:10:49.551
And I banish you...

1109
01:10:49.655 --> 01:10:53.551
-...out of my ex but maybe
future girlfriend Amy.

1110
01:10:59.448 --> 01:11:01.206
-Amy?

1111
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:03.793
Hey. Amy. are you okay?

1112
01:11:03.896 --> 01:11:05.896
-That was the worst
demon cleansing

1113
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.551
Deominous has ever heard.

1114
01:11:08.655 --> 01:11:15.310
And Deominous has been cast
out of a lot of bodies.

1115
01:11:18.931 --> 01:11:20.413
-Amy?

1116
01:11:20.517 --> 01:11:23.034
-Come back over here!

1117
01:11:23.137 --> 01:11:24.586
Come back over here!

1118
01:11:24.689 --> 01:11:26.758
No. No. no!
No. no.

1119
01:11:26.862 --> 01:11:28.586
Amy. stop it.

1120
01:11:36.275 --> 01:11:39.103
I-I know you told me I can't
miss any more nights.

1121
01:11:39.206 --> 01:11:44.206
but I've been going through
a lot. personally. and --

1122
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:46.758
-Do you know the procedure?
-Yes.

1123
01:11:46.862 --> 01:11:49.172
No. I know.
I know the procedure.

1124
01:11:49.275 --> 01:11:51.310
Yeah.

1125
01:11:51.413 --> 01:11:53.344
Sorry.
It's. um -- It's my boss.

1126
01:11:53.448 --> 01:11:56.655
He's just really mad because
I haven't really been on my --

1127
01:11:56.758 --> 01:11:58.241
my A game at work lately.

1128
01:11:58.344 --> 01:12:00.931
and I promised that
I would work tonight.

1129
01:12:01.034 --> 01:12:02.758
and. um. I'm trying
to get out of it.

1130
01:12:02.862 --> 01:12:03.896
-Raah!
-Okay.

1131
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.068
I. um --
I printed these.

1132
01:12:06.172 --> 01:12:07.655
The Internet has
a lot of great tips

1133
01:12:07.758 --> 01:12:08.896
about how to exorcise demons.

1134
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.655
-Raah!
-It says to start by drawing

1135
01:12:11.758 --> 01:12:12.655
a protective circle.

1136
01:12:12.758 --> 01:12:13.827
We're gonna protect up.

1137
01:12:13.931 --> 01:12:15.758
Here. watch your feet.
Okay.

1138
01:12:15.862 --> 01:12:17.172
So. uh. okay.

1139
01:12:17.275 --> 01:12:20.931
Draw protective symbols
that represent virtue.

1140
01:12:21.034 --> 01:12:22.758
Okay.
Here. watch your feet.

1141
01:12:22.862 --> 01:12:23.965
What? No -- No. please.

1142
01:12:24.068 --> 01:12:26.000
No. stop.
You're messing up my --

1143
01:12:26.103 --> 01:12:27.551
It's okay.

1144
01:12:31.034 --> 01:12:32.241
Oh. something's working.

1145
01:12:32.344 --> 01:12:34.413
Oh. I --
Yes. No. I was listening.

1146
01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:37.517
No. sir. I wasn't.
Please don't transfer me to H.R.

1147
01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.896
Please don't --

1148
01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:45.413
I'm on hold now.
Awesome.

1149
01:12:47.241 --> 01:12:50.206
-I made this.
See. demons hate these.

1150
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:51.931
So just. here. take it.
It's okay.

1151
01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.241
It'll be good.
Here. really.

1152
01:12:53.344 --> 01:12:55.206
Just take it. It's okay.
In the hand.

1153
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:56.689
Here. just --

1154
01:12:56.793 --> 01:12:58.103
-Sorry! I'm sorry!

1155
01:12:58.206 --> 01:12:59.551
-Hello? Hi! Help!

1156
01:12:59.655 --> 01:13:02.310
I mean. no. hi.
I'm Will. I'm here to help --

1157
01:13:03.896 --> 01:13:06.310
-He's lying.
Oh. he's lying.

1158
01:13:06.413 --> 01:13:10.344
Yes. I did go off script
the other night a little bit.

1159
01:13:10.448 --> 01:13:12.931
but I did not say
that Presto Paste

1160
01:13:13.034 --> 01:13:15.172
was the official
toothpaste of Satan.

1161
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.172
-What was that?

1162
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.034
That's the TV. Sorry.
It's the little TV.

1163
01:13:25.137 --> 01:13:28.931
-Amy will be sacrificed!

1164
01:13:29.034 --> 01:13:34.310
Amy will be taken to Hell.

1165
01:13:34.413 --> 01:13:40.689
Amy's soul belongs to Deominous.

1166
01:13:40.793 --> 01:13:43.896
-Well. yeah. that's pretty bad.

1167
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.517
But please. um. don't fire me.

1168
01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:50.586
This is all I have.

1169
01:13:52.068 --> 01:13:54.034
No. please.

1170
01:14:07.655 --> 01:14:09.689
Stay.

1171
01:14:13.827 --> 01:14:15.862
What?!
Are you guys

1172
01:14:15.965 --> 01:14:18.000
here to interfere
with my life some more?

1173
01:14:18.103 --> 01:14:20.620
-Ever since the cleansing.
I've been connected

1174
01:14:20.724 --> 01:14:22.724
with the energy here.

1175
01:14:22.827 --> 01:14:27.827
I can feel some kind of...
domestic disturbance.

1176
01:14:27.931 --> 01:14:30.965
Lost love...
possessed by darkness.

1177
01:14:32.448 --> 01:14:35.344
Doesn't sound like
anything going on here.

1178
01:14:35.448 --> 01:14:37.344
Is that Amy?

1179
01:14:37.448 --> 01:14:39.206
Tied up in the living room?
Oh. my God. Will.

1180
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:40.965
Oh. my God!
What did you do?!

1181
01:14:41.068 --> 01:14:42.793
We're complicit now.
You realize that. right?

1182
01:14:42.896 --> 01:14:44.137
The police are gonna
question us.

1183
01:14:44.241 --> 01:14:45.586
and I can't lie to the police.
Will.

1184
01:14:45.689 --> 01:14:46.827
-You're not in court!

1185
01:14:46.931 --> 01:14:49.103
And no one's
going to trial or Hell.

1186
01:14:49.206 --> 01:14:50.965
I didn't do anything.
It's all Deominous's fault.

1187
01:14:51.068 --> 01:14:54.241
Things were going
so well with Amy.

1188
01:14:54.344 --> 01:14:56.103
And then Deominous showed up...
-What?!

1189
01:14:56.206 --> 01:14:58.344
-...and possessed her soul
and ruined everything.

1190
01:14:58.448 --> 01:14:59.793
-Okay. well.
we have to get in there.

1191
01:14:59.896 --> 01:15:01.448
-We have to help her.
-No. Why. why?

1192
01:15:01.551 --> 01:15:04.275
You guys don't -- You don't
think I can do this on my own?

1193
01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:05.689
You don't think
I can win her back

1194
01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:06.965
from Deominous with true love?

1195
01:15:07.068 --> 01:15:10.827
-No.
You can't.

1196
01:15:10.931 --> 01:15:14.275
Listen.
that whole 3:15 a.m. thing.

1197
01:15:14.379 --> 01:15:16.413
that's what a gateway to Hell
can open.

1198
01:15:16.517 --> 01:15:18.896
So if Deominous has successfully
possessed someone.

1199
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.689
all he has to do
is open that portal

1200
01:15:20.793 --> 01:15:24.000
at 3:15 to take them -- forever.

1201
01:15:26.034 --> 01:15:28.206
Are you saying Amy's gonna die?

1202
01:15:32.344 --> 01:15:34.793
-We don't have a lot of time.

1203
01:15:34.896 --> 01:15:37.482
Let's save her together.

1204
01:15:37.586 --> 01:15:39.931
Okay?

1205
01:15:40.034 --> 01:15:42.241
-Yeah.

1206
01:15:42.344 --> 01:15:43.310
-Okay.

1207
01:15:50.758 --> 01:15:52.517
Oh. she --
-Oh. God.

1208
01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:55.620
-She was just here.
You guys saw her.

1209
01:15:55.724 --> 01:15:58.413
Oh. she took my headset.

1210
01:15:58.517 --> 01:16:01.137
-"Save your loved ones
from the demons of Hell

1211
01:16:01.241 --> 01:16:03.068
in three easy steps."

1212
01:16:03.172 --> 01:16:04.862
-Yeah. it seemed easy enough.

1213
01:16:04.965 --> 01:16:07.586
Besides. you guys already
burned all my sage and stuff.

1214
01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:11.965
-"The first step is to take away
their rock and roll music."

1215
01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.275
Okay.

1216
01:16:13.379 --> 01:16:15.137
-Yeah. I said it was easy.

1217
01:16:16.689 --> 01:16:18.034
Amy?

1218
01:16:18.137 --> 01:16:19.413
-We gotta find her.

1219
01:16:22.034 --> 01:16:23.551
-Whoa. whoa. whoa!

1220
01:16:27.586 --> 01:16:30.241
Is this because you never
liked my pottery?

1221
01:16:30.344 --> 01:16:31.896
Whoa!

1222
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.206
Okay! Okay!

1223
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:35.034
You can destroy all my hobbies!

1224
01:16:35.137 --> 01:16:37.655
We just want Amy's. uh. soul?

1225
01:16:38.965 --> 01:16:41.862
-Amy's soul is mine.

1226
01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:45.172
-Come on.

1227
01:16:45.275 --> 01:16:46.206
Unh!

1228
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:48.620
-I should've told you
about that.

1229
01:16:48.724 --> 01:16:50.310
Man...

1230
01:16:50.413 --> 01:16:52.206
-Ugh!
-Oh. yeah. Sorry.

1231
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:53.620
I-I knew about that. too.

1232
01:16:53.724 --> 01:16:55.586
-Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

1233
01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.379
-Hello?

1234
01:16:59.482 --> 01:17:01.344
Ghosts?

1235
01:17:01.448 --> 01:17:03.275
Demons?

1236
01:17:03.379 --> 01:17:04.137
Goblins?

1237
01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:05.965
Oh!
Uh. hi. Will

1238
01:17:06.068 --> 01:17:09.965
I didn't think
you'd still be here.

1239
01:17:10.068 --> 01:17:11.241
-You knew.

1240
01:17:11.344 --> 01:17:12.965
Why didn't you tell me
about Deominous

1241
01:17:13.068 --> 01:17:14.655
before I rented your house?

1242
01:17:14.758 --> 01:17:16.931
-Sorry.
We're sorry. okay?

1243
01:17:17.034 --> 01:17:20.137
But you were
supposed to be the sacrifice

1244
01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:23.793
instead of our sweet Grace.

1245
01:17:23.896 --> 01:17:26.379
-Oh. yeah?
Well. the joke's on you

1246
01:17:26.482 --> 01:17:28.689
because the demon
didn't even want me.

1247
01:17:28.793 --> 01:17:32.206
Nope. He decided to possess
everybody I love instead.

1248
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:36.620
And he's got my ex-girlfriend
in the basement right now!

1249
01:17:36.724 --> 01:17:38.413
-That doesn't sound like a joke.

1250
01:17:38.517 --> 01:17:40.413
-Who are these people?
-We're his friends.

1251
01:17:40.517 --> 01:17:43.275
-But you said
you didn't have any friends.

1252
01:17:43.379 --> 01:17:45.896
-Okay. everybody calm down.

1253
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.586
Sellers family...

1254
01:17:49.689 --> 01:17:54.551
I forgive you for trying
to sacrifice my soul.

1255
01:17:54.655 --> 01:17:58.827
Now let's focus
on the task at hand --

1256
01:17:58.931 --> 01:18:03.310
rescuing the love of my life.
Amy.

1257
01:18:03.413 --> 01:18:06.655
-But I don't want to rescue her.

1258
01:18:06.758 --> 01:18:08.310
I want someone to be sacrificed

1259
01:18:08.413 --> 01:18:10.034
so we can live
in our house again.

1260
01:18:10.137 --> 01:18:13.034
-Shh!
Shh!

1261
01:18:13.137 --> 01:18:16.068
No one's getting sacrificed
tonight. Ken. Got it?

1262
01:18:16.172 --> 01:18:19.586
That's not going to happen.

1263
01:18:21.482 --> 01:18:24.448
Ohh! Ohh!
Hey!

1264
01:18:25.965 --> 01:18:27.344
-Will!

1265
01:18:29.103 --> 01:18:30.758
Just stay there!
We'll figure something out.

1266
01:18:34.172 --> 01:18:36.793
-I think I gotta do this alone.

1267
01:18:36.896 --> 01:18:39.620
-Will...

1268
01:18:39.724 --> 01:18:43.448
you have to be prepared
that you might not get her back.

1269
01:18:43.551 --> 01:18:46.689
-I know.

1270
01:18:46.793 --> 01:18:48.310
I know.

1271
01:19:02.482 --> 01:19:04.965
-We have to perform a seance.
-Right.

1272
01:19:05.068 --> 01:19:06.827
I mean.
no. absolutely not.

1273
01:19:06.931 --> 01:19:08.172
You said that's dangerous.

1274
01:19:08.275 --> 01:19:10.517
-But Will and Amy are stuck
in that basement.

1275
01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:12.689
and the only chance
that they have

1276
01:19:12.793 --> 01:19:15.344
is if we can somehow figure out
a way to sever the link

1277
01:19:15.448 --> 01:19:18.965
between Deominous
and those spirits.

1278
01:19:19.068 --> 01:19:22.034
Please.

1279
01:19:22.137 --> 01:19:24.275
Let's do this together.
Right?

1280
01:19:29.827 --> 01:19:31.103
Okay. Yeah. Cool.

1281
01:19:31.206 --> 01:19:34.655
You guys just
hang out or whatever.

1282
01:19:34.758 --> 01:19:36.931
-We're gonna need a way
to communicate.

1283
01:19:37.034 --> 01:19:40.206
Something analog.
Uh. a tape recorder.

1284
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:43.620
candles. cushions...
a spirit board.

1285
01:19:43.724 --> 01:19:45.482
Will has those
gross candles upstairs.

1286
01:19:45.586 --> 01:19:48.862
-I have cushions.
They're vintage silk.

1287
01:19:48.965 --> 01:19:51.379
-Tammy. don't engage.

1288
01:19:51.482 --> 01:19:54.931
-I have a board that can
connect us with the dead.

1289
01:19:55.034 --> 01:19:57.379
-Why do you need
to talk to ghosts. Jake?

1290
01:20:00.275 --> 01:20:03.206
God. you're so weird.

1291
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:05.586
-That just leaves
the tape recorder.

1292
01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:08.379
-Does this work?

1293
01:20:10.655 --> 01:20:12.793
-Don't give up!
You're doing awesome!

1294
01:20:12.896 --> 01:20:14.137
-Ugh.

1295
01:20:14.241 --> 01:20:15.689
-You should feel it
right in your glutes.

1296
01:20:15.793 --> 01:20:18.827
-Whatever this is. we're gonna
have to tape over it.

1297
01:20:21.793 --> 01:20:24.344
-Something smells...
-Terrible?

1298
01:20:24.448 --> 01:20:29.000
It's the candles...
mixed with demon stench.

1299
01:20:30.413 --> 01:20:31.862
-Can we just get this over with?

1300
01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:42.344
-Oh. spirits...

1301
01:20:42.448 --> 01:20:47.172
if you have occupied this house.
if you have terrorized

1302
01:20:47.275 --> 01:20:53.137
and annoyed those living here.
we summon you back.

1303
01:20:53.241 --> 01:20:55.448
We summon you to face us.

1304
01:20:55.551 --> 01:21:01.241
-And we'd like to make an appeal
to keep Will and Amy

1305
01:21:01.344 --> 01:21:04.620
in the custody of the living.

1306
01:21:04.724 --> 01:21:08.862
Please.
Thank you.

1307
01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:10.689
Your Honor.

1308
01:21:42.862 --> 01:21:45.034
-Aah!

1309
01:21:45.137 --> 01:21:46.758
Where do you keep coming from?!

1310
01:21:46.862 --> 01:21:49.000
Just leave me alone. please!

1311
01:22:10.068 --> 01:22:11.862
-Amy.

1312
01:22:11.965 --> 01:22:15.172
Or...Deominous.

1313
01:22:15.275 --> 01:22:18.620
You can send as many ghosts
as you want to try to stop me.

1314
01:22:18.724 --> 01:22:20.241
They're really scary.

1315
01:22:20.344 --> 01:22:23.862
but I'm not
gonna let Amy down this time.

1316
01:22:23.965 --> 01:22:24.896
Can you tell her that?

1317
01:22:30.551 --> 01:22:32.310
Guess not.

1318
01:22:32.413 --> 01:22:34.586
Clearly. you got your own thing

1319
01:22:34.689 --> 01:22:38.586
going on with that...hole.

1320
01:22:38.689 --> 01:22:42.517
Uh...

1321
01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:47.310
But it doesn't matter.
because if you take Amy to Hell.

1322
01:22:47.413 --> 01:22:49.068
then I'm coming to hell. too.

1323
01:22:49.172 --> 01:22:52.413
Yeah. you're gonna be
stuck with me.

1324
01:23:04.344 --> 01:23:08.413
-Spirits. are you standing
behind Grace right now?

1325
01:23:13.482 --> 01:23:15.206
-No.

1326
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:16.724
-Are you in the house?

1327
01:23:19.724 --> 01:23:20.517
-Yes.

1328
01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:33.172
-We know that Deominous
has used you.

1329
01:23:33.275 --> 01:23:34.965
possessed you into doing evil.

1330
01:23:35.068 --> 01:23:36.206
We want to help.

1331
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:38.034
How do we banish
Deominous forever

1332
01:23:38.137 --> 01:23:41.724
so that you can return
to the afterlife in peace?

1333
01:23:46.448 --> 01:23:48.655
Spirits...

1334
01:23:48.758 --> 01:23:50.482
why won't you answer?

1335
01:23:54.965 --> 01:23:58.413
-The...

1336
01:23:58.517 --> 01:24:00.068
girl.

1337
01:24:00.172 --> 01:24:02.137
-Something about Grace?

1338
01:24:02.241 --> 01:24:03.172
What is it?
What's wrong with her?

1339
01:24:03.275 --> 01:24:07.448
-Nothing!
She's perfect!

1340
01:24:07.551 --> 01:24:10.034
-De...

1341
01:24:10.137 --> 01:24:11.482
ominous...

1342
01:24:11.586 --> 01:24:13.862
poss...essed...

1343
01:24:13.965 --> 01:24:16.310
two...

1344
01:24:16.413 --> 01:24:19.793
living...

1345
01:24:19.896 --> 01:24:22.000
souls.

1346
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.896
-No. No. He's the woman
in the basement.

1347
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.310
He doesn't want Grace.

1348
01:24:30.413 --> 01:24:32.758
Wrong. Daddy.

1349
01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:37.206
-Grace!
-No! Wait!

1350
01:24:39.344 --> 01:24:43.137
-Amy. please.
we're running out of time!

1351
01:24:43.241 --> 01:24:45.827
-Oh. shit!

1352
01:24:54.137 --> 01:24:56.172
-What was that?
It's just --

1353
01:24:56.275 --> 01:24:58.344
It's just toothpaste.

1354
01:24:58.448 --> 01:25:01.034
Ohh. God!

1355
01:25:11.241 --> 01:25:13.724
-Has your sister been possessed
by Deominous before?

1356
01:25:13.827 --> 01:25:16.137
-Yeah. but the demon said
he'd let Grace go if --

1357
01:25:16.241 --> 01:25:17.965
-Wait. wait. wait.

1358
01:25:18.068 --> 01:25:20.137
You can't bargain with a demon.

1359
01:25:20.241 --> 01:25:22.793
He's gonna take everything.

1360
01:25:22.896 --> 01:25:24.793
-That can't be legal.

1361
01:25:24.896 --> 01:25:26.965
-Look!

1362
01:25:34.931 --> 01:25:40.655
-Spirits. are you standing
behind Grace right now?

1363
01:25:40.758 --> 01:25:43.517
Are you in the house?

1364
01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:46.068
We know that Deominous
has used you.

1365
01:25:46.172 --> 01:25:48.275
possessed you into doing evil.

1366
01:25:48.379 --> 01:25:50.724
We want to help.
How do we banish Deominous

1367
01:25:50.827 --> 01:25:54.689
forever so that you can return
to the afterlife in peace?

1368
01:25:54.793 --> 01:25:57.689
-Destroy object.

1369
01:25:57.793 --> 01:26:01.758
Demon-made.

1370
01:26:01.862 --> 01:26:03.310
-Okay!
That's why!

1371
01:26:03.413 --> 01:26:05.206
That's why they weren't
answering on the board.

1372
01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:06.862
It's 'cause they knew
that Deominous

1373
01:26:06.965 --> 01:26:08.068
was listening through Grace.

1374
01:26:08.172 --> 01:26:11.965
-Oh. uh. hey.

1375
01:26:12.068 --> 01:26:14.896
Do -- Do you need some help?

1376
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.344
-Uh. it's -- it's okay.
It's...

1377
01:26:17.448 --> 01:26:19.206
It's -- It's not that.
-Yeah.

1378
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:20.551
-It's just kind of
a one-man job.

1379
01:26:20.655 --> 01:26:24.413
-Yeah.
No. no. it's stupid anyway.

1380
01:26:24.517 --> 01:26:25.379
-Hyah!

1381
01:26:28.068 --> 01:26:30.482
Holy shit.

1382
01:26:30.586 --> 01:26:32.241
Let's go.

1383
01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:37.344
-I'm wiping it all off.

1384
01:26:37.448 --> 01:26:41.241
It's okay.
It's fine. It's fine.

1385
01:26:41.344 --> 01:26:43.448
It's not fine.
It's horrible!

1386
01:26:43.551 --> 01:26:44.931
Oh. my God.

1387
01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:47.793
Ohh!

1388
01:26:47.896 --> 01:26:49.310
What are you guys doing?

1389
01:26:49.413 --> 01:26:52.758
Huh?
What are you doing?

1390
01:26:52.862 --> 01:26:54.758
You do everything
Deominous says.

1391
01:26:54.862 --> 01:26:56.137
You let him in over and over.

1392
01:26:56.241 --> 01:26:58.827
just do whatever
he wants you to do.

1393
01:26:58.931 --> 01:27:00.137
And for what?

1394
01:27:00.241 --> 01:27:01.586
What do you get?

1395
01:27:01.689 --> 01:27:04.448
He gets a sacrifice.

1396
01:27:04.551 --> 01:27:07.482
And you get nothing.

1397
01:27:07.586 --> 01:27:12.551
You do all this stuff.
and it means nothing.

1398
01:27:21.689 --> 01:27:22.689
Amy?

1399
01:27:30.724 --> 01:27:32.517
Amy...

1400
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.137
What...

1401
01:27:39.241 --> 01:27:42.793
I'm doing nothing.

1402
01:27:55.379 --> 01:27:57.689
-Will...

1403
01:27:57.793 --> 01:27:59.931
I'm here.

1404
01:28:00.034 --> 01:28:04.586
-Okay. What kind of thing
would a demon make?

1405
01:28:04.689 --> 01:28:06.896
-Oh!

1406
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.896
-No. Will made that.

1407
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.448
Cheese board.

1408
01:28:11.551 --> 01:28:13.068
-But if the ghost
wanted to help us.

1409
01:28:13.172 --> 01:28:14.724
why are they helping the demon?

1410
01:28:14.827 --> 01:28:16.655
-Well. they're not good or bad.
They're just dead.

1411
01:28:16.758 --> 01:28:18.965
But once Deominous possessed
their spirit form.

1412
01:28:19.068 --> 01:28:22.103
he can kind of use them
to do whatever he wants.

1413
01:28:22.206 --> 01:28:24.793
I think he might be
overextending himself right now.

1414
01:28:24.896 --> 01:28:26.896
-Like Will with his hobbies.
-Exactly.

1415
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.206
Deominous is splitting himself

1416
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:31.310
between the other
Amy. Grace. and the spirits.

1417
01:28:31.413 --> 01:28:32.827
This could be our chance
to stop him.

1418
01:28:32.931 --> 01:28:34.689
This is it. right?

1419
01:28:34.793 --> 01:28:36.965
-Pottery class.

1420
01:28:37.068 --> 01:28:38.758
-Really?

1421
01:28:41.551 --> 01:28:43.448
Aah! Aah!

1422
01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:46.379
-Oh. my God!

1423
01:28:46.482 --> 01:28:49.206
-Ohh!

1424
01:28:53.896 --> 01:28:56.551
-Hey.
Are you okay?

1425
01:28:58.758 --> 01:29:00.379
-Yeah.
-Uh...

1426
01:29:00.482 --> 01:29:03.206
does this Will guy make cakes?

1427
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:06.172
-Yeah.

1428
01:29:06.275 --> 01:29:07.896
Except for one.

1429
01:29:12.862 --> 01:29:13.931
-Amy?

1430
01:29:17.344 --> 01:29:19.000
You said you wanted closure.

1431
01:29:34.517 --> 01:29:36.206
-Here just -- just hold on
just a second. please.

1432
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:37.793
Just stop.
Just --

1433
01:29:37.896 --> 01:29:40.206
I just --
I gotta tell you something.

1434
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:42.689
-Um...

1435
01:29:42.793 --> 01:29:46.689
There's so many great things
you're gonna do.

1436
01:29:46.793 --> 01:29:51.896
And you're so sure of yourself
and where you're going.

1437
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.965
And...

1438
01:29:55.068 --> 01:29:56.517
I was scared to go
with you that night

1439
01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:01.689
because I thought if I went.
you'd see just

1440
01:30:01.793 --> 01:30:07.310
how much your life's
moving forward and...

1441
01:30:07.413 --> 01:30:11.620
how you deserve more than me.

1442
01:30:15.103 --> 01:30:17.896
So I'm not gonna keep
holding on to you.

1443
01:30:30.931 --> 01:30:32.724
-Will?

1444
01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:34.965
-Hey! Hey.

1445
01:30:36.793 --> 01:30:41.241
I thought -- I thought
you were gone forever.

1446
01:30:41.344 --> 01:30:45.758
'Cause you were digging
that hole forever.

1447
01:30:45.862 --> 01:30:47.206
-Digging what?

1448
01:30:50.586 --> 01:30:52.655
-Wait!
-No.

1449
01:30:52.758 --> 01:30:54.103
I'm not quitting
this time. okay?

1450
01:30:54.206 --> 01:30:55.379
Everyone's getting out of this.

1451
01:30:55.482 --> 01:30:56.689
That demon's going back to Hell.

1452
01:30:56.793 --> 01:30:59.275
and you and I...

1453
01:30:59.379 --> 01:31:01.241
You know. we'll...
whatever you want.

1454
01:31:01.344 --> 01:31:04.448
I'm very...casual and open.

1455
01:31:07.793 --> 01:31:08.586
Oh. my God!

1456
01:31:18.379 --> 01:31:20.206
-Oh. Amy. This is Aimee.

1457
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:21.586
She spells her name
with two E's.

1458
01:31:21.689 --> 01:31:22.620
-Hi.

1459
01:31:22.724 --> 01:31:26.137
-Um. so. Grace is Deominous now.

1460
01:31:26.241 --> 01:31:28.620
What should we do?
-Deominous could not listen

1461
01:31:28.724 --> 01:31:30.620
to Will's little speech anymore.

1462
01:31:30.724 --> 01:31:34.103
You made him so mushy and gross!

1463
01:31:34.206 --> 01:31:36.103
He can have his girlfriend back!

1464
01:31:36.206 --> 01:31:37.379
-Oh. we're not --
-We're not toge--

1465
01:31:37.482 --> 01:31:39.034
-Are -- No. we're not.
-Look!

1466
01:31:39.137 --> 01:31:41.482
She's digging a hole to Hell
or something. man.

1467
01:31:43.241 --> 01:31:46.827
-I've never seen
anything like that.

1468
01:31:46.931 --> 01:31:49.551
-I have.

1469
01:31:49.655 --> 01:31:51.000
My rotten tooth. remember?

1470
01:31:51.103 --> 01:31:54.206
It was covered in nasty plaque
just like this.

1471
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:55.827
-Plaque?

1472
01:31:58.724 --> 01:32:00.896
-Oh. my parents stopped
buying that stuff.

1473
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:01.931
Tastes like shit.

1474
01:32:02.034 --> 01:32:04.931
-They changed the formula. Jake.

1475
01:32:05.034 --> 01:32:07.758
-All right. yeah.

1476
01:32:07.862 --> 01:32:09.172
-Aah!

1477
01:32:09.275 --> 01:32:11.413
-Deominous already
has a sacrifice.

1478
01:32:11.517 --> 01:32:15.482
You cannot save Grace now.
It is over.

1479
01:32:17.551 --> 01:32:19.586
-Aah!

1480
01:32:39.965 --> 01:32:42.413
That did not look cool!

1481
01:32:42.517 --> 01:32:45.620
And now Deominous
has to dig another hole!

1482
01:32:45.724 --> 01:32:46.758
-Don't listen to her. man!

1483
01:32:46.862 --> 01:32:48.586
That was awesome.
That was --

1484
01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:51.724
That was one of the coolest
things I've ever seen you do.

1485
01:32:51.827 --> 01:32:53.551
-It was?

1486
01:32:53.655 --> 01:32:55.655
Also. I kicked the shit
out of a door upstairs.

1487
01:32:55.758 --> 01:32:57.620
-Nice.
-Deominous!

1488
01:32:57.724 --> 01:32:59.448
I cast you out of Grace Sellers!

1489
01:33:01.206 --> 01:33:03.172
No!

1490
01:33:03.275 --> 01:33:05.724
-Then I banish you
to an object of your creation!

1491
01:33:05.827 --> 01:33:08.482
-Oh!
That. right?

1492
01:33:08.586 --> 01:33:11.551
-No!

1493
01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:24.241
-Will!
-Amy!

1494
01:33:27.655 --> 01:33:30.413
Hyah!

1495
01:33:30.517 --> 01:33:32.379
-Aah!

1496
01:33:58.862 --> 01:34:00.931
It didn't work.

1497
01:34:01.034 --> 01:34:03.482
It didn't work...

1498
01:34:40.206 --> 01:34:41.862
-We did it.

1499
01:34:41.965 --> 01:34:43.965
Where's Mom and Dad?

1500
01:34:44.068 --> 01:34:48.206
-Right here.

1501
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:50.827
-We got trapped
in the guest room.

1502
01:34:50.931 --> 01:34:52.724
It was awful.

1503
01:34:52.827 --> 01:34:55.517
But we survived.

1504
01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:57.896
-But...

1505
01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.551
what about the ghosts?

1506
01:34:59.655 --> 01:35:02.310
-Well. we destroyed the object
containing Deominous's spirit.

1507
01:35:02.413 --> 01:35:06.758
so they're free to move on
to the next realm.

1508
01:35:27.448 --> 01:35:29.482
I guess they're happy here.

1509
01:35:29.586 --> 01:35:30.793
-Oh. no.
No. no.

1510
01:35:30.896 --> 01:35:32.931
This is our house.
The demon left.

1511
01:35:33.034 --> 01:35:34.586
so they have to go. too.

1512
01:35:38.448 --> 01:35:39.896
Do something!

1513
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.862
-I can't.
They're at peace.

1514
01:35:46.689 --> 01:35:48.689
-Over my dead body.

1515
01:35:48.793 --> 01:35:52.827
That's my remote.
my TV. my house!

1516
01:36:00.689 --> 01:36:02.517
-Hi.

1517
01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:11.034
What?

1518
01:36:11.137 --> 01:36:14.103
-It's just what you said.

1519
01:36:14.206 --> 01:36:17.689
You didn't give up on me
or that girl or...

1520
01:36:17.793 --> 01:36:19.517
any of it.

1521
01:36:27.896 --> 01:36:29.931
-Come on.

1522
01:36:49.137 --> 01:36:52.517
-Hey.
-Hey.

1523
01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:56.517
-Um. your cake looks amazing.
-Thank you.

1524
01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:59.172
I'm sure you made
some extravagant cake

1525
01:36:59.275 --> 01:37:01.068
that's gonna put
all ours to shame.

1526
01:37:01.172 --> 01:37:03.344
-Oh. what?
No. No. no. no.

1527
01:37:12.689 --> 01:37:15.206
Ken.

1528
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:17.724
And this is the living room.

1529
01:37:17.827 --> 01:37:20.068
-I know.
I'm selling you the house.

1530
01:37:20.172 --> 01:37:21.655
-Orange belt.
Nice.

1531
01:37:21.758 --> 01:37:25.448
-Mom. can we go play?
-Yeah.

1532
01:37:27.344 --> 01:37:29.000
-Happy saving you from the demon

1533
01:37:29.103 --> 01:37:32.758
who wanted to take
your soul to Hell Anniversary.

1534
01:37:32.862 --> 01:37:34.793
-Yeah.
That one's. uh. for you.

1535
01:37:34.896 --> 01:37:37.103
-Oh. dude.
the whole cake's for Amy?

1536
01:37:37.206 --> 01:37:38.827
-Oh. no. I mean.
everyone can have some.

1537
01:37:38.931 --> 01:37:40.896
Um. Ken. did you want
to try some cake?

1538
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.172
-You think some cake
is gonna make up for you

1539
01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:45.448
letting those damn ghosts
ruin our property value?

1540
01:37:45.551 --> 01:37:47.862
-Come on.
You know. they don't --

1541
01:37:47.965 --> 01:37:49.379
They don't know any better.

1542
01:37:49.482 --> 01:37:51.172
You can't blame them
for being --

1543
01:37:51.275 --> 01:37:52.000
Ohh!

1544
01:37:54.896 --> 01:37:57.931
You just gotta let them do
what they're gonna do.

1545
01:37:58.034 --> 01:37:59.931
I mean. take this guy.
for example.

1546
01:38:00.034 --> 01:38:03.034
He loves dark little corners
and closets.

1547
01:38:03.137 --> 01:38:05.000
Don't you. bud?

1548
01:38:05.103 --> 01:38:07.103
Yeah.
You see the shirt he's wearing?

1549
01:38:07.206 --> 01:38:10.689
I'm not getting it back
for an eternity.

1550
01:38:10.793 --> 01:38:13.068
He told me that -- in Latin.

1551
01:38:13.172 --> 01:38:15.689
I got a Latin dictionary.

1552
01:38:15.793 --> 01:38:17.379
No. no!

1553
01:38:17.482 --> 01:38:20.620
And he's not getting his creepy
little toy horse thingy back.

1554
01:38:20.724 --> 01:38:23.896
Two can play at this game.

1555
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.310
Kids.

1556
01:38:29.137 --> 01:38:30.965
-Just great.

1557
01:38:31.068 --> 01:38:33.551
Sign here.
and this nightmare house

1558
01:38:33.655 --> 01:38:36.862
and all the terrible things
in it are yours.

1559
01:38:36.965 --> 01:38:39.034
-Okeydokey.

1560
01:38:57.137 --> 01:38:58.931
-So it's been a year?

1561
01:38:59.034 --> 01:39:01.517
That's what you're celebrating?

1562
01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:04.724
-And six months
since we started our business.

1563
01:39:04.827 --> 01:39:06.310
It was Will's idea.

1564
01:39:06.413 --> 01:39:08.275
And his toothpaste overstock.

1565
01:39:08.379 --> 01:39:09.793
We just bought the rights
from Presto Paste

1566
01:39:09.896 --> 01:39:11.448
when they changed
their formula back.

1567
01:39:11.551 --> 01:39:16.793
and I got to bust out the old
patent acquisition contract.

1568
01:39:16.896 --> 01:39:18.931
What a rush.

1569
01:39:19.034 --> 01:39:20.689
-Great.
Have a wonderful life.

1570
01:39:20.793 --> 01:39:22.931
I hope we never meet again.

1571
01:39:23.034 --> 01:39:25.655
-Until you need
to close a Hell portal.

1572
01:39:25.758 --> 01:39:27.827
Sorry.
-We'll call you.

1573
01:39:31.896 --> 01:39:34.482
-I can't find Grace anywhere.

1574
01:39:37.482 --> 01:39:40.517
-Grace?!

1575
01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.206
Grace?!

1576
01:39:47.206 --> 01:39:49.448
-Sorry.
I was listening to this.

1577
01:39:49.551 --> 01:39:51.586
Can I keep it?

1578
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.482
-Yeah.

1579
01:40:02.413 --> 01:40:04.068
-Does it feel weird
to part with that thing?

1580
01:40:04.172 --> 01:40:07.379
-No. I never want
to see it again.

1581
01:40:07.482 --> 01:40:10.034
-Maybe it was a good thing
we went through all of that.

1582
01:40:10.137 --> 01:40:13.793
-Yeah. In a way.
I'm kind of glad it happened.

1583
01:40:13.896 --> 01:40:16.068
-I'm not.
-Well. I think we can all

1584
01:40:16.172 --> 01:40:17.862
be glad that
he never found a vessel

1585
01:40:17.965 --> 01:40:19.551
that would allow him
to leave the house.

1586
01:40:19.655 --> 01:40:22.275
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1587
01:40:22.379 --> 01:40:24.758
-That would be terrible.

1588
01:40:45.413 --> 01:40:47.827
-Oh. shit.
