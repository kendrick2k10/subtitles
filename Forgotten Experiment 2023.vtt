3
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:20.833
Time.

4
00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:23.083
Biggest mystery of the universe.

5
00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:25.625
It's an eternal engine.

6
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:28.708
and now. we know
how to use this force.

7
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.500
The last five hours.
we've been flying

8
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:33.333
the first plane
powered by the absolutely new.

9
00:01:33.375 --> 00:01:36.208
super-powerful source of energy.

10
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.250
This energy. quantanium.
is produced from time.

11
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:43.000
Our plane will fly around
the globe at record speed.

12
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:46.916
and we will return
to investors and guests.

13
00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.375
Here with you
is the crew captain.

14
00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:52.333
the incredible creator
of quantanium...

15
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.375
Me!

16
00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:58.375
Access
to aircraft control blocked.

17
00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:01.041
Autopilot engaged.

18
00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:02.916
We have a problem
with the system!

19
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:08.041
I can't control the plane!

20
00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.541
We're losing
altitude and velocity!

21
00:02:18.583 --> 00:02:20.416
The switchboard is unresponsive.

22
00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:21.875
I can't switch off
the autopilot.

23
00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:23.458
We're going down fast!

24
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.791
Ladies and gentlemen.
this is your captain speaking!

25
00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.375
We've been blessed
with a unique chance

26
00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:29.208
to enjoy
a particularly close view

27
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.958
of the Pacific Ocean.

28
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.208
We're going into the water!

29
00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:37.708
What's up with the faces?

30
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.500
This is
a remarkable opportunity!

31
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:40.916
Take a look at Roderick.

32
00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.166
now here is someone who knows
how to enjoy the moment!

33
00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:44.875
My name is Ryan!

34
00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:47.666
Ethan. you told me
the flight was perfectly safe!

35
00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:49.000
And it's true!

36
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:50.833
We are safe while we're flying.

37
00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:53.000
I told you
we should have carried out

38
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.208
the first flight remotely.
without the crew!

39
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.291
And we'd have lost
the plane by now!

40
00:02:58.083 --> 00:03:00.000
Luckily. I have an idea.

41
00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:10.750
What was that?

42
00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:13.083
- I switched it off.
- Switched what off?

43
00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.125
The plane.

44
00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:18.541
Ted and. what's your name.
brace yourselves!

45
00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:20.083
I'm going to turn it back on!

46
00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:30.625
Access
to aircraft control blocked.

47
00:03:30.666 --> 00:03:32.916
Autopilot engaged.

48
00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:35.333
The autopilot
is still taking us down!

49
00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:40.125
Ladies and gentlemen.

50
00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:41.833
the captain did
everything he could.

51
00:03:43.083 --> 00:03:44.666
We have a couple of minutes
to live

52
00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:46.666
and I'd like to enjoy
these moments.

53
00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:48.625
Bravo. Ethan!
Totally your style!

54
00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.791
Are we crashing? I can't crash!

55
00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:52.250
I have
a fashion stream tomorrow!

56
00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:54.291
You make your great entrance
and leave it for others

57
00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:55.375
to pick up the pieces!

58
00:03:55.416 --> 00:03:57.541
Ethan.
stop this right now!

59
00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:01.166
There's an island below us.

60
00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:03.208
We're gonna crash!

61
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.375
I am Eva Adams.

62
00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:30.000
Today. you and I will learn

63
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:33.041
some fascinating things
about time.

64
00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:35.083
Things you have never suspected.

65
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.333
Please welcome the head
of "Blake Exploration".

66
00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:42.625
An inventor.

67
00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:44.041
An innovator.

68
00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.958
A visionary.

69
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.291
Ethan Blake!

70
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:53.958
His brother. Jacob Blake.

71
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.125
Commercial director
of the company.

72
00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:02.708
I've spent
my entire life studying time.

73
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.166
trying to find an answer
to its questions.

74
00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:08.416
While time
hasn't been kind to you.

75
00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:10.500
Your father.
Professor Henry Blake.

76
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:12.750
disappeared in 1984.

77
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.083
when you were only
six years old.

78
00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:18.416
He was the first in the world
to obtain energy from time.

79
00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:20.583
While Ethan put his ideas
to work.

80
00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:27.416
Today. I will make time
work for us!

81
00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:38.166
Before you is...

82
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:41.291
quantanium!

83
00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:44.833
The most powerful.
most efficient

84
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:47.833
and eco-friendly energy
on Earth.

85
00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:50.333
Here.
we have the very first plane

86
00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:53.083
that is powered by quantanium!

87
00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:56.166
We are about to perform

88
00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:59.958
the first nonstop flight
around he world.

89
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.958
breaking all known
altitude and speed records.

90
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Our company's chief engineer.

91
00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.208
Ted Decker.

92
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.208
And... others.

93
00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:19.458
"How's it going. Eva?"

94
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.250
That's stupid.

95
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:22.875
"Eva. you look gorgeous!"

96
00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:27.000
Hey. gorgeous. you look Eva!

97
00:06:30.708 --> 00:06:33.041
I-I'm Ethan's right hand man!

98
00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:34.708
Well. I mean...

99
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.708
I'm one of his hands.

100
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.458
I... but I do what
his right hand does. I mean.

101
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.583
he usually does it
by himself. but...

102
00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:45.000
But I...

103
00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:46.291
Come on.

104
00:06:50.583 --> 00:06:52.625
I've named this plane
in honor of a person

105
00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:55.041
I hold very dear to my heart.

106
00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:58.291
The person who's been close
since I was a child.

107
00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:01.333
In honor
of my dear friend and colleague.

108
00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:03.958
Elizabeth Paulsen.

109
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.333
Two days ago.
we said our final goodbyes.

110
00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:11.666
Elizabeth never liked my work
on new sources of energy.

111
00:07:11.708 --> 00:07:14.166
she believed
they could be misused.

112
00:07:15.416 --> 00:07:16.916
Ever since I was a kid.

113
00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:21.083
she tried to restrain
my craving for invention.

114
00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:24.083
and I always found a way
to outwit her.

115
00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:29.208
And now. I've found a way
to do it one last time.

116
00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:33.750
Fly with me. Elizabeth.

117
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:29.583
Hey.
That's my quantanium.

118
00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:21.541
STOP
PROHIBITED AREA

119
00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:51.083
It's beautiful out here!

120
00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:54.458
Don't be afraid!
I just want to talk!

121
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.750
At gunpoint?

122
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.708
It's gone.

123
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:59.875
Come out now!

124
00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:17.541
I don't usually
carry guns but...

125
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.666
But there's shooting out there!

126
00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:23.166
You guys are the real deal.

127
00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:24.958
No question about that. but...

128
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.458
me. I just want to return
what is mine.

129
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.000
I get it. it's hard to imagine
I would end up here.

130
00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:32.250
Who are you?

131
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.041
Don't look!

132
00:10:35.083 --> 00:10:38.083
Sorry. Hard to resist.

133
00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:40.875
Well. I'm not made of iron.

134
00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:42.416
And you're very beautiful.

135
00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:45.291
I don't usually react this way.

136
00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:47.708
Hold it! Don't move!

137
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:52.875
Are you seriously
pointing a gun at me?

138
00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:54.791
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

139
00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:56.583
Don't provoke me or I'll shoot!

140
00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:57.958
Who are you to threaten me?

141
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.083
Who are you?

142
00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.333
- And you?
- Don't move!

143
00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:03.416
I can read "Moposova".

144
00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:05.458
Turn around and walk that way!

145
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.791
Where?

146
00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.333
Where you'll entertain
our security service! Hmm.

147
00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:12.166
Honey. you've hit
a civilian plane!

148
00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:13.375
Don't push me. or I'll shoot--

149
00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:20.166
What now?

150
00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:22.041
Not so brave anymore. huh?

151
00:11:23.125 --> 00:11:25.958
Damn. you could have hit me!

152
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.291
Too bad I missed.

153
00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:32.916
Well. go. Go.

154
00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.500
- Where?
- Where?

155
00:11:34.541 --> 00:11:36.291
To your accomplices!

156
00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:38.833
You will return what is mine
and I will forgive you!

157
00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:42.875
Walk. walk.

158
00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:06.875
Listen. we got off
on the wrong foot.

159
00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:08.375
You just need to return
what is mine.

160
00:12:08.416 --> 00:12:10.791
and I won't tell anyone
what you're up to.

161
00:12:14.916 --> 00:12:16.750
This fog is all over the place.

162
00:12:16.791 --> 00:12:18.416
What fog?

163
00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:20.125
And I refuse to talk to you.

164
00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:24.833
Fine. And how far away are we?

165
00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:26.125
We're already there!

166
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:44.000
Okay. I need to go.

167
00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:46.250
Time to say goodbye.

168
00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:52.833
Come back soon.

169
00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:57.375
Jacob.

170
00:12:57.416 --> 00:12:58.958
Bye. Daddy.

171
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Ethan.

172
00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:10.916
I'm gonna be away
for a really long time.

173
00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.333
Two years.

174
00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:17.083
Why don't you stay
at your stupid work forever!

175
00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:18.291
Ethan!

176
00:13:18.333 --> 00:13:20.458
- I'll go get him. Dad!
- No. no. no.

177
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.250
It's okay. Jacob. It's okay.

178
00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:25.875
In time. he'll understand.

179
00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:31.625
As for now. you must take
good care of your brother.

180
00:13:31.666 --> 00:13:34.750
And remember this.
Whatever you do.

181
00:13:34.791 --> 00:13:37.833
always follow through
to the end.

182
00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:43.000
No matter what or who
should stand in your way.

183
00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:44.041
Understood?

184
00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:07.250
No. no. no. no. no. no!

185
00:15:07.291 --> 00:15:08.875
My quantanium!

186
00:15:08.916 --> 00:15:10.208
You bastards!

187
00:15:15.208 --> 00:15:17.583
You'll pay
for every single ounce!

188
00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:39.083
Are you okay? Not injured?

189
00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:42.250
The quantanium is gone!

190
00:15:42.291 --> 00:15:45.333
Oh. we're all right. by the way.
thanks for asking.

191
00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:47.041
Care to tell me where you were?

192
00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:48.458
Soldiers took our quantanium.

193
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.833
so I went after them!

194
00:15:49.875 --> 00:15:51.541
Soldiers? Damn it.

195
00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.875
What were you going to do.
attack them?

196
00:15:53.916 --> 00:15:56.291
Our quantanium
has been destroyed!

197
00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:59.291
Not only is it three years
of my work and all that we have.

198
00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:01.625
but the plane will not take off
without it!

199
00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:05.541
Ethan and Jacob.
the Blake brothers!

200
00:16:05.583 --> 00:16:07.000
This is my last recording.

201
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:09.083
I give you my murderers!

202
00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:13.333
She scratched herself
during the crash.

203
00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:15.375
- What is that?
- My painkillers.

204
00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:17.916
Isn't that a little too much?

205
00:16:17.958 --> 00:16:20.125
What is this mess
I've dragged you all into?

206
00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:22.208
I'm a monster!

207
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:23.833
What are you talking about?

208
00:16:26.583 --> 00:16:28.083
Um...

209
00:16:29.416 --> 00:16:31.125
Mister Blake....

210
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.125
Ted....

211
00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:35.791
Eva...

212
00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:37.541
- Um...
- What?

213
00:16:37.583 --> 00:16:39.125
F-forgive me. please.

214
00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:42.875
but you're all here
because of me.

215
00:16:44.041 --> 00:16:45.041
What?

216
00:16:46.375 --> 00:16:49.083
The switchboard didn't go out.

217
00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:52.750
I laid the route
to this location...

218
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:57.875
and programmed the autopilot
to land us here.

219
00:16:57.916 --> 00:17:00.500
You idiot! Why did you do that?

220
00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:03.125
Because Elizabeth.
Mrs. Paulsen.

221
00:17:03.166 --> 00:17:05.125
she said
that Ethan needed to come here

222
00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:07.875
and that we would find
something precious!

223
00:17:07.916 --> 00:17:11.375
And that... I would have
my chance to be...

224
00:17:12.791 --> 00:17:14.291
of assistance.

225
00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:17.166
That is a confession
of an attempt on my life!

226
00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:18.458
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
hold on. hold on.

227
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.416
maybe it's not so bad.

228
00:17:20.458 --> 00:17:24.208
If the autopilot landed us.
the plane is fine.

229
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.916
It won't fly without quantanium.

230
00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:29.041
but the emergency beacon
would have sent out

231
00:17:29.083 --> 00:17:32.000
our coordinates.
they will come looking for us!

232
00:17:32.041 --> 00:17:35.416
Not exactly.

233
00:17:35.458 --> 00:17:38.083
Um. Mrs. Paulsen said
that nobody except for us

234
00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:39.291
should come here.

235
00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:42.833
And so I... dismantled
the emergency beacon

236
00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:43.958
before we took off.

237
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.125
and now
nobody knows where we are.

238
00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:48.708
You made my daughter an orphan!

239
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.458
You made my daughter an orphan!

240
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.250
You son of a bitch!

241
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:53.916
They'll never.
ever find us now!

242
00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.708
All right. stop that!

243
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.166
You can kill him later!

244
00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.666
Screw Elizabeth!

245
00:17:59.708 --> 00:18:00.750
That's why she talked me

246
00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:01.958
into getting you
on the test flight!

247
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.125
You both set me up!

248
00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:07.458
No! I thought that we would find
a treasure here!

249
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.333
And my mom thought so too!

250
00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:11.958
You didn't tell me anything

251
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.541
but you told
your freaking mother?

252
00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:15.625
O... kay!

253
00:18:16.083 --> 00:18:17.291
Okay!

254
00:18:20.583 --> 00:18:26.125
The thing is. nothing's working.
No phone. no radio.

255
00:18:26.166 --> 00:18:28.250
We're cut off
from the rest of the world.

256
00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.958
But this place looks like
some kind of camp.

257
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.416
And there should be
a transmitter here.

258
00:18:37.458 --> 00:18:40.000
Okay. Rinaldo. try to recall.

259
00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:41.916
By any chance.
did Elizabeth tell you anything

260
00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:43.000
about this place?

261
00:18:43.041 --> 00:18:44.250
I'm Ryan...

262
00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:46.333
Whatever! That's not
what I'm asking!

263
00:18:46.375 --> 00:18:47.625
No. she didn't say anything.

264
00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:49.166
I didn't even know
it was an island.

265
00:19:09.291 --> 00:19:10.458
Ethan.

266
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.166
we've brought people here.

267
00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:13.958
We are responsible for them.

268
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.041
I have a more interesting goal.

269
00:19:18.916 --> 00:19:21.666
And you call our father selfish?

270
00:19:21.708 --> 00:19:24.916
Unlike our father.
I'm an honest man.

271
00:19:24.958 --> 00:19:27.041
I didn't start a family
just to abandon it.

272
00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:47.166
TINA MOROZOVA

273
00:20:15.291 --> 00:20:17.250
Hello. my dear Matt.

274
00:20:17.291 --> 00:20:19.041
It's so sad that the professor
couldn't take you

275
00:20:19.083 --> 00:20:21.416
to the island as his assistant.

276
00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:24.583
I was so looking forward
to seeing you here!

277
00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:26.666
But on the other hand.
I can answer

278
00:20:26.708 --> 00:20:29.250
all of your questions
in my letters.

279
00:20:29.291 --> 00:20:30.583
As you know.

280
00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:33.000
our scientific station
is top secret.

281
00:20:33.041 --> 00:20:35.083
so we won't be alone.

282
00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:37.875
Major. I swear not to give away
any secrets.

283
00:20:37.916 --> 00:20:40.416
and please. don't laugh
at all the silly things

284
00:20:40.458 --> 00:20:42.125
I'm about to tell my friend.

285
00:20:43.541 --> 00:20:45.416
Oh. so this is you.

286
00:20:45.458 --> 00:20:47.166
First of all.
I must tell you

287
00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:48.708
how I've settled here.

288
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.833
I have a lovely bungalow house.

289
00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.458
I'm sure you'd like it.

290
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.666
And at night. I can see
the constellation of Leo

291
00:20:54.708 --> 00:20:56.000
through my window.

292
00:20:56.041 --> 00:20:57.625
Your Zodiac sign!

293
00:20:57.666 --> 00:21:01.458
And... here I often dream
about our meeting.

294
00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:25.458
Ethan!

295
00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:32.250
Ethan!

296
00:22:38.416 --> 00:22:44.458
Today. we are receiving
the best scientists

297
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.000
and our friends.

298
00:22:47.041 --> 00:22:50.208
I want to express
my gratitude to all...

299
00:22:52.958 --> 00:22:56.500
In my homeland.
they laughed at my work.

300
00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:58.083
- but you...
- What's going on?

301
00:22:58.125 --> 00:23:00.375
...the great people.
believed in me!

302
00:23:01.666 --> 00:23:03.916
And I did not disappoint you!

303
00:23:06.208 --> 00:23:10.291
Today is August 22nd....

304
00:23:11.083 --> 00:23:13.250
1986.

305
00:23:14.666 --> 00:23:15.750
Dad?

306
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.583
This day will never be forgotten
as the day

307
00:23:20.625 --> 00:23:25.875
when the most powerful energy
in the world was born!

308
00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:32.833
Today. I made time work for us!

309
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.583
Whoa! There it is!

310
00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:42.375
- Let's--
- Friends!

311
00:23:42.416 --> 00:23:45.958
How wonderful it is
that you came to my channel!

312
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.833
My quantanium!

313
00:23:58.208 --> 00:23:59.500
So she's got it!

314
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.666
Come on. Rob.

315
00:24:29.708 --> 00:24:31.541
I want to finish
the movie. Mommy.

316
00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:33.791
What if we sing our song
as we walk?

317
00:24:33.833 --> 00:24:35.875
Sounds good.

318
00:24:35.916 --> 00:24:38.791
♪ How many miles to Babylon? ♪

319
00:24:38.833 --> 00:24:41.416
♪ Three score miles and ten ♪

320
00:24:41.458 --> 00:24:44.208
♪ Can I get there
By candle-light? ♪

321
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.916
♪ Yes. and back again! ♪

322
00:25:14.583 --> 00:25:17.041
Are we going to the hospital?

323
00:25:31.208 --> 00:25:33.125
Got you. thief!

324
00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:34.500
Where is it?

325
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:36.416
I saw you had the quantanium.
where'd you put it?

326
00:25:53.625 --> 00:25:55.125
Did that make you feel
like a Bond girl just now?

327
00:25:55.166 --> 00:25:56.541
Who the hell are you?

328
00:25:56.583 --> 00:25:57.708
I get it. in the fog.
it's hard to make things out.

329
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:58.875
but it's me again.

330
00:25:58.916 --> 00:26:00.083
What do you mean. again?

331
00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:02.291
Are you kidding?
You nearly killed me there!

332
00:26:02.333 --> 00:26:04.208
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

333
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.791
Oh. I see.
I see what you're doing here.

334
00:26:06.833 --> 00:26:08.583
"I don't remember.
so it never happened."

335
00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:10.375
I've never seen you before!

336
00:26:10.416 --> 00:26:13.083
So sincere. you almost got me.

337
00:26:13.125 --> 00:26:15.000
Wait. did you really...

338
00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:16.333
did you really forget?

339
00:26:16.375 --> 00:26:18.250
How could I forget something
that never happened?

340
00:26:18.291 --> 00:26:20.333
Hey! Where is my quantanium?

341
00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:21.500
When did it become yours?

342
00:26:21.541 --> 00:26:23.583
- When I created it!
- You created it?

343
00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:25.041
- Me!
- When?

344
00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:26.291
In 2019!

345
00:26:26.333 --> 00:26:28.291
Tell that to Professor Blake!

346
00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:30.083
Wait! What Blake?

347
00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:32.083
Henry Blake.
He created quantanium.

348
00:26:32.125 --> 00:26:34.166
And I hate to break it to you.
but it's 1986.

349
00:26:34.208 --> 00:26:35.416
Henry Blake?

350
00:26:35.458 --> 00:26:36.708
- Wait. he's here?
- Don't move.

351
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:37.791
stay where you are!

352
00:26:37.833 --> 00:26:40.458
On the ground. both of you!

353
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.625
I'll deal with this.
and we'll get back to it.

354
00:26:42.666 --> 00:26:43.708
- Sir--
- Don't move!

355
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.041
I said. stand where you are!

356
00:26:45.083 --> 00:26:47.458
There's a tough case here.
The girl's a little off.

357
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.791
she thinks
she's stuck in the past!

358
00:26:48.833 --> 00:26:49.958
- Stand still!
- You're not wrong.

359
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.333
- Get down or I'll shoot!
- I'm Ethan Blake!

360
00:26:51.375 --> 00:26:52.583
- Get down!
- Ethan Blake.

361
00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:53.666
Get down. or I'll shoot you!

362
00:26:53.708 --> 00:26:54.958
I can show you
my ID on my phone!

363
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.791
- Get down! Get down!
- Look! Look! Look!

364
00:27:26.708 --> 00:27:28.916
You have no idea
who you're dealing with!

365
00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:32.291
I am Ethan Blake's
personal bodyguard!

366
00:27:32.333 --> 00:27:34.208
And these hands have seen blood!

367
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.000
I am an American citizen!

368
00:27:37.041 --> 00:27:38.625
My father's a senator!

369
00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:47.708
Eva!

370
00:27:51.916 --> 00:27:53.791
Did you see that?

371
00:27:53.833 --> 00:27:54.875
Everyone's gone!

372
00:27:54.916 --> 00:27:57.166
I saw our father. Ethan!

373
00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:58.500
He was making a speech.

374
00:27:58.541 --> 00:28:00.750
He said it was August 22--

375
00:28:00.791 --> 00:28:01.916
1986!

376
00:28:01.958 --> 00:28:05.000
Yes! That's two years
after he left us!

377
00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:09.833
Everything disappeared
as soon as the fog faded.

378
00:28:09.875 --> 00:28:11.041
What was that?

379
00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:14.083
Why did he not disappear?

380
00:28:16.875 --> 00:28:18.833
He might know
what's going on here!

381
00:28:20.958 --> 00:28:22.083
Hey!

382
00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:31.125
Hey!

383
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.791
August 22. 1986. 10 p.m.

384
00:29:57.833 --> 00:30:00.208
Interrogation of Tina Morozova
is conducted

385
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:02.041
in the presence of Henry Blake.

386
00:30:02.083 --> 00:30:03.375
I know you.

387
00:30:03.416 --> 00:30:05.333
At around 9 p.m.. Ms. Morozova

388
00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:09.541
stole the quantanium
in an attempt to damage the TAU.

389
00:30:09.583 --> 00:30:11.333
The perpetrator
has been detained.

390
00:30:11.375 --> 00:30:14.166
No quantanium was found on her.

391
00:30:14.208 --> 00:30:16.416
How much did they pay you
to do this?

392
00:30:18.041 --> 00:30:21.666
200. 300 dollars?

393
00:30:21.708 --> 00:30:25.208
Did you plan this
with your... lover?

394
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.708
I acted alone!

395
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.250
You heard the recordings.

396
00:30:28.291 --> 00:30:30.333
Matt and I are just pen pals.

397
00:30:30.375 --> 00:30:32.875
He's not on the island.
and he can't be here!

398
00:30:32.916 --> 00:30:35.625
Why did you want
to destroy the TAU?

399
00:30:35.666 --> 00:30:37.250
I've already told you.

400
00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:40.583
Yes. yes. yes.
we're all going to die.

401
00:30:40.625 --> 00:30:41.916
But it's true!

402
00:30:41.958 --> 00:30:43.916
I spoke with soldiers
from the future!

403
00:30:43.958 --> 00:30:48.500
Millions are going to die.
and it's all because of us!

404
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.583
This is it. Dad.

405
00:30:55.208 --> 00:30:57.291
Now I know what you were up to.

406
00:31:08.791 --> 00:31:10.500
One more word.
and your rotten tongue

407
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:12.000
will be food for worms!

408
00:31:12.041 --> 00:31:13.416
Mother of God!

409
00:31:16.416 --> 00:31:19.541
Missing our mommy already.
aren't we?

410
00:31:26.583 --> 00:31:29.458
Your manners haven't improved
since I left.

411
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.375
What kind of life
do I have here?

412
00:31:31.416 --> 00:31:36.000
I know a guy who thinks
there's a... treasure...

413
00:31:36.958 --> 00:31:38.250
Treasure!

414
00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:41.666
This blade could not wait
any longer!

415
00:31:41.708 --> 00:31:44.000
It's been a while
since it touched blood!

416
00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:45.875
We spare only
women and children!

417
00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:47.083
I am a child!

418
00:31:48.958 --> 00:31:50.791
Dorothy!

419
00:31:50.833 --> 00:31:52.916
I can't believe
I didn't notice it sooner!

420
00:31:52.958 --> 00:31:54.458
On the Road
of Yellow Bricks!

421
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.916
Listen.
what is this place?

422
00:31:55.958 --> 00:31:58.041
We fell down
on this island and...

423
00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:00.208
You fell down. my dear?

424
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.458
Then off you go to bed!

425
00:32:07.083 --> 00:32:09.750
I have a few questions.

426
00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:12.166
Hey. if you're so smart.
answer this question--

427
00:32:12.208 --> 00:32:14.208
How do I get
to the testing site?

428
00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:17.791
Why is a raven
like a writing desk?

429
00:32:17.833 --> 00:32:20.916
Changing the subject
in someone else's house

430
00:32:20.958 --> 00:32:22.958
is poor form!

431
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.833
Off with his head!
Off with his head!

432
00:32:25.875 --> 00:32:27.541
Off with his head!

433
00:32:27.583 --> 00:32:30.250
Off with his head!

434
00:32:46.416 --> 00:32:50.625
"To my dear son Rob.
for his ninth birthday."

435
00:32:51.666 --> 00:32:52.958
Come on. Robert.

436
00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:07.416
Rob? Is that you?

437
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.250
Damn. you're that little boy
from the movie theater.

438
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.916
Dear Mary.

439
00:33:23.958 --> 00:33:28.208
How long has it been
since the winds blew you here

440
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.333
along with your mother?

441
00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:34.375
Rob's mom is acting
beyond improper.

442
00:33:35.708 --> 00:33:38.541
She comes to the movie theater
every night.

443
00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:41.416
and she never recognizes
her own son!

444
00:33:48.166 --> 00:33:49.208
Fog?

445
00:33:53.458 --> 00:33:54.583
Ethan. are you there?

446
00:33:54.625 --> 00:33:56.250
I'm down here! I'm fine!

447
00:33:58.166 --> 00:33:59.750
But we are not!

448
00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:05.583
We're in some kind of war zone.

449
00:34:31.708 --> 00:34:33.041
EXPERIMENT IN PROGRESS

450
00:34:45.666 --> 00:34:47.500
Lima. this is Delta!
Do you copy?

451
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:50.791
Delta. report!
Have you located the target?

452
00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:53.333
This is Delta.
Intel confirmed.

453
00:34:53.375 --> 00:34:54.750
She hid the quantanium here.

454
00:34:54.791 --> 00:34:55.833
Package secured.

455
00:34:55.875 --> 00:34:56.916
Give them a visual.

456
00:34:58.416 --> 00:35:00.000
We'll take them up to the rocks.

457
00:35:00.041 --> 00:35:02.125
Storm the bunker on my signal.

458
00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:03.625
That's my quantanium!

459
00:35:07.833 --> 00:35:09.000
Quiet!

460
00:35:15.041 --> 00:35:16.416
Get down on the floor. now!

461
00:35:16.458 --> 00:35:18.125
- Don't move!
- Get down on your knees!

462
00:35:18.166 --> 00:35:19.458
On the ground!

463
00:35:20.625 --> 00:35:22.791
You shall not pass!

464
00:35:34.166 --> 00:35:35.333
What was that?

465
00:35:36.333 --> 00:35:37.958
And what are these things?

466
00:35:42.916 --> 00:35:44.500
I've had enough of your antics!

467
00:35:44.541 --> 00:35:45.583
You almost got us killed!

468
00:35:45.625 --> 00:35:48.000
What the hell do you want here?

469
00:35:48.041 --> 00:35:50.250
If you're so smart. answer this.

470
00:35:50.291 --> 00:35:52.541
why is a raven
like a writing desk?

471
00:35:57.333 --> 00:35:59.416
This looks like an HQ bunker.

472
00:36:01.041 --> 00:36:02.916
There should be
a transmitter around.

473
00:36:04.125 --> 00:36:07.916
Mister Blake.
we need to find Eva now!

474
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:10.416
We better call for help
before we get killed!

475
00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:16.708
Put these on!

476
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:21.958
- No questions.
- I'm not putting that on.

477
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:29.541
A whole flock of crows.

478
00:36:29.583 --> 00:36:33.083
One of you definitely
will squawk too loud!

479
00:36:33.125 --> 00:36:34.958
These are loyal hounds. Captain!

480
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.750
We can rely on them
on our journey!

481
00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:39.958
Is Blake's treasure
a long way from here?

482
00:36:45.375 --> 00:36:49.083
The road is long.
rocky and treacherous!

483
00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:52.708
Captain. what if someone else
will find the treasure?

484
00:36:55.666 --> 00:36:56.875
Follow me!

485
00:37:02.166 --> 00:37:03.875
I have a radical idea.

486
00:37:03.916 --> 00:37:07.166
Just ask this chap
if he has a transmitter!

487
00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:08.666
The only way
to get through to him

488
00:37:08.708 --> 00:37:10.708
is by talking in character.

489
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.291
He has been stuck here
for 40 years

490
00:37:13.333 --> 00:37:15.875
with nothing but his books.
he's gone off the rails.

491
00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:17.458
Captivating story.

492
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.000
And how is this
going to help us exactly?

493
00:37:21.791 --> 00:37:23.375
Whatever it is
our father created

494
00:37:23.416 --> 00:37:26.250
when he left us.
it is also here.

495
00:37:26.291 --> 00:37:28.041
You saw this looney
dissolve the fog.

496
00:37:28.083 --> 00:37:29.583
he must be onto something.

497
00:37:33.041 --> 00:37:34.958
Only Gandalf has the power

498
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
to dissolve
this treacherous fog!

499
00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:40.500
I guess
we're not pirates anymore.

500
00:37:40.541 --> 00:37:43.500
Um... Master Gandalf. sir.

501
00:37:43.541 --> 00:37:46.458
Where does the fog recede?

502
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.458
The fog is the breath
of Smaug the dragon.

503
00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:55.333
And where is Smaug himself?

504
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:30.208
My faithful companions.
Tin Man.

505
00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:32.458
Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow!

506
00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:38.416
Today. I will tell you...
a fairy tale!

507
00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:43.916
Once upon a time.
Henry Blake landed here...

508
00:38:43.958 --> 00:38:46.000
to conquer time itself.

509
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:48.416
He wanted to obtain

510
00:38:48.458 --> 00:38:51.291
the most powerful energy
on Earth.

511
00:38:52.291 --> 00:38:53.500
And to achieve that.

512
00:38:53.541 --> 00:38:56.750
he had to create
something heretofore...

513
00:38:56.791 --> 00:38:58.250
unknown!

514
00:39:05.625 --> 00:39:10.916
A one-of-a-kind iron dragon
that consumes time.

515
00:39:10.958 --> 00:39:13.708
The legendary...

516
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:16.708
...TAU engine!

517
00:39:23.208 --> 00:39:25.166
And TAU is the treasure

518
00:39:25.208 --> 00:39:28.458
that the wise sorceress
Elizabeth sent me here to find!

519
00:39:32.708 --> 00:39:34.750
We've found it.

520
00:39:34.791 --> 00:39:36.500
Our father's legacy.

521
00:39:38.708 --> 00:39:40.666
Never gave her much credit.

522
00:39:40.708 --> 00:39:43.875
But... where did the fog
come from?

523
00:39:43.916 --> 00:39:48.375
It's time
for a little press conference!

524
00:39:48.416 --> 00:39:53.458
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ethan Blake!

525
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.708
Thank you. Jacob.

526
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.208
You're asking
where the fog came from.

527
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:59.958
We have the answer for you!

528
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.291
It took us three full years
to come up with quantanium.

529
00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:06.958
while here.
it took them just 20 minutes!

530
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.916
Since quantanium
was made so quickly.

531
00:40:08.958 --> 00:40:10.833
the process had a side effect.

532
00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:12.958
This thing
that looks like fog to us.

533
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.875
It's a mass
of processed quantum particles

534
00:40:14.916 --> 00:40:18.166
that carry an imprint of events
happening on a specific day.

535
00:40:18.208 --> 00:40:20.375
An "imprint of events?"

536
00:40:20.416 --> 00:40:21.708
What does that even mean?

537
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:26.416
Uh... We have
an answer for that.

538
00:40:28.166 --> 00:40:31.333
It's like a video recording.

539
00:40:31.375 --> 00:40:36.250
Inside the fog. a copy
of the day is being replayed.

540
00:40:36.291 --> 00:40:40.250
A day in the fog
runs parallel to ours.

541
00:40:40.291 --> 00:40:42.583
When it's noon here.
it's noon there.

542
00:40:42.625 --> 00:40:45.625
When it's 8 p.m. for them.
it's the same here for us.

543
00:40:45.666 --> 00:40:49.250
Hold on.
so if these people in the fog

544
00:40:49.291 --> 00:40:51.333
are just copies
of some day in the past.

545
00:40:51.375 --> 00:40:53.791
then how are we able
to interact with them?

546
00:40:53.833 --> 00:40:56.500
Because it's quantum copies.

547
00:40:56.541 --> 00:40:58.416
But the war and the scientists.

548
00:40:58.458 --> 00:41:00.833
those are
clearly different days!

549
00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:03.583
There are two days
playing out in the fog.

550
00:41:03.625 --> 00:41:07.291
August 22nd. 1986.

551
00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:09.958
and the final point
of the time wave.

552
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.041
August 22. 2036.

553
00:41:14.083 --> 00:41:17.208
They were able to produce
quantanium so quickly

554
00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:22.541
because they were working
with a 50-year time wave.

555
00:41:28.875 --> 00:41:30.500
...Mr. Blake.
we've tracked

556
00:41:30.541 --> 00:41:31.875
the source of the signal.
but if we look at the map.

557
00:41:31.916 --> 00:41:34.125
there's nothing there
but the ocean.

558
00:41:34.166 --> 00:41:35.916
Oh. believe me.

559
00:41:35.958 --> 00:41:38.208
there's definitely
an island here.

560
00:41:39.208 --> 00:41:40.791
Waiting for you.

561
00:41:40.833 --> 00:41:42.416
The ship sails tomorrow morning.

562
00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:44.958
it'll be there in two days.
Mr. Blake.

563
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.250
- Roger that. Over and out.
- Over and out.

564
00:41:47.291 --> 00:41:49.791
We need to figure out
how the TAU engine works

565
00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:51.000
and how to bring it with us.

566
00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:52.916
But... but what about Eva?

567
00:41:52.958 --> 00:41:54.833
They'll be here
the day after tomorrow.

568
00:41:54.875 --> 00:41:56.750
I'm sure that they'll find her.

569
00:41:56.791 --> 00:41:58.250
You're not planning
on looking for her

570
00:41:58.291 --> 00:41:59.875
until the day after tomorrow?

571
00:41:59.916 --> 00:42:01.625
But she's injured!
She could be in danger!

572
00:42:01.666 --> 00:42:04.375
That's enough! Stay out of this.

573
00:42:06.666 --> 00:42:10.500
Mister Blake.

574
00:42:10.541 --> 00:42:12.458
Mister Blake.
I dreamed of working for you.

575
00:42:14.833 --> 00:42:18.208
But once I got to know you.
I realized that you're...

576
00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:19.708
you're ready to throw
anybody under the bus

577
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:20.750
because you're...

578
00:42:22.166 --> 00:42:23.208
an asshole!

579
00:42:31.666 --> 00:42:34.625
Here. Elizabeth asked me
to give you this

580
00:42:34.666 --> 00:42:36.291
once we got to the destination.

581
00:42:39.166 --> 00:42:40.791
She said you'd change
once you got here.

582
00:42:45.583 --> 00:42:47.250
And she was right.

583
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:48.541
Just for the worse.

584
00:42:59.916 --> 00:43:01.166
I'll go get him.

585
00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:06.708
Ryan!

586
00:44:10.291 --> 00:44:12.375
Get down
on the floor. now!

587
00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:13.875
He's a civilian!

588
00:44:13.916 --> 00:44:15.375
- How did you even get here?
- Delta. report.

589
00:44:15.416 --> 00:44:17.750
Have you located the target?

590
00:44:17.791 --> 00:44:19.750
Wait a minute.
I've seen him before.

591
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:21.541
We'll take them
up to the rocks.

592
00:44:21.583 --> 00:44:23.958
Storm the bunker on my signal.

593
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.750
Damn. that's him!

594
00:44:25.791 --> 00:44:27.750
- I'll kill you. you bastard!
- Don't shoot. don't shoot. no!

595
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:28.833
Stop! Are you crazy?

596
00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:30.083
It's Ethan Blake!

597
00:44:30.125 --> 00:44:31.416
Blake is an old man.

598
00:44:31.458 --> 00:44:33.041
What's your name?
What's your name?

599
00:44:33.083 --> 00:44:34.166
It's me. it's me. me!

600
00:44:34.208 --> 00:44:35.500
My... my... my name is
Ethan Blake!

601
00:44:35.541 --> 00:44:36.916
Leave him.
he's a temporal.

602
00:44:36.958 --> 00:44:39.791
Even better!
I can kill him all over again!

603
00:44:39.833 --> 00:44:43.458
Look! They died because
of you and your brother!

604
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.791
That's my wife and kid!

605
00:44:44.833 --> 00:44:46.166
Uh... I don't know them!

606
00:44:46.208 --> 00:44:47.416
The UN tried to remove

607
00:44:47.458 --> 00:44:49.250
the TAU engine tech from you.

608
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:50.791
That kind of power
shouldn't be in the hands

609
00:44:50.833 --> 00:44:52.583
of one corporation.

610
00:44:52.625 --> 00:44:55.625
So you and your brother
decided to start a war

611
00:44:55.666 --> 00:44:58.458
with your army
of unmanned machines.

612
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:00.875
You've hidden this island
from us for years.

613
00:45:00.916 --> 00:45:02.250
but we found it.

614
00:45:02.291 --> 00:45:04.083
And when we get to the TAU.

615
00:45:04.125 --> 00:45:06.416
we'll have a chance
of an equal fight!

616
00:45:06.458 --> 00:45:07.750
Why are you even talking to him?

617
00:45:07.791 --> 00:45:09.416
He's nothing but a bunch of fog!

618
00:45:09.458 --> 00:45:11.333
I want him to know
what this is for.

619
00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:13.750
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't! No! Don't!

620
00:47:33.625 --> 00:47:36.000
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

621
00:47:41.541 --> 00:47:43.125
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

622
00:47:43.166 --> 00:47:44.833
Ryan. we'll get you a doctor!

623
00:47:45.708 --> 00:47:46.916
Don't you die on me!

624
00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:52.291
Hold on! Hold on!

625
00:47:53.791 --> 00:47:55.250
- Ethan!
- What?

626
00:47:55.291 --> 00:47:56.375
It's over.

627
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:10.250
I have to find his mom.

628
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:14.750
Tell her how it happened.

629
00:48:18.208 --> 00:48:22.416
Tell her... that I would be dead
if it wasn't for him.

630
00:48:25.625 --> 00:48:27.333
That he died because of me.

631
00:48:29.666 --> 00:48:30.666
No.

632
00:48:34.208 --> 00:48:35.958
He died because of me.

633
00:48:38.875 --> 00:48:41.125
This is
what Elizabeth had feared.

634
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.000
Here is the first aid station...

635
00:49:16.041 --> 00:49:19.000
where everyone can get
the necessary medical help.

636
00:49:20.166 --> 00:49:23.750
And over there.
we have a whole hospital

637
00:49:23.791 --> 00:49:26.166
for more serious cases.

638
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:31.791
Thanks to the generosity
of the government.

639
00:49:32.708 --> 00:49:35.000
we've built a fully functional--

640
00:49:35.041 --> 00:49:36.416
So what now?

641
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.083
You think you won?

642
00:49:41.291 --> 00:49:42.875
Well. I have news for you.

643
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:45.750
You're already dead.

644
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:48.291
All of you! Dead!

645
00:49:48.333 --> 00:49:50.416
Dead man! Corpse!

646
00:49:52.166 --> 00:49:53.166
And you...

647
00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:56.041
Are you proud of yourself?

648
00:49:56.083 --> 00:49:57.708
But you are just a fog now!

649
00:49:59.208 --> 00:50:03.208
A self-centered nothing.
as you always were.

650
00:50:07.041 --> 00:50:09.625
And I will make a weapon
using your energy!

651
00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:11.375
Wait!

652
00:50:14.791 --> 00:50:16.083
Bring him to my office.

653
00:50:20.875 --> 00:50:22.791
You had good intentions.
didn't you?

654
00:50:23.666 --> 00:50:25.083
Well. I did too!

655
00:50:33.791 --> 00:50:38.375
Wow! All it took
was one discovery

656
00:50:38.416 --> 00:50:41.583
for them
to start planting spies.

657
00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:45.416
Who sent you?

658
00:50:46.791 --> 00:50:50.250
Americans? Brits? Germans?

659
00:50:50.291 --> 00:50:53.375
They laughed at me.
and now they finally get

660
00:50:53.416 --> 00:50:55.541
that they missed out
on a genius.

661
00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:00.166
Are you having a stroke?

662
00:51:00.208 --> 00:51:03.875
Or is this the effect
of my discovery?

663
00:51:03.916 --> 00:51:05.916
My invention
will change the world.

664
00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:08.250
my name is already written
in history.

665
00:51:09.458 --> 00:51:11.375
I'm going to be commemorated.

666
00:51:12.083 --> 00:51:13.291
Everywhere.

667
00:51:14.625 --> 00:51:16.750
Now I see
why I turned out this way.

668
00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:18.375
Who cares
how you turned out?

669
00:51:18.416 --> 00:51:19.958
Exactly.

670
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.250
You never cared. for sure.

671
00:51:22.291 --> 00:51:25.750
Today I've solved
the universe's greatest mystery.

672
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:27.125
Time?

673
00:51:27.166 --> 00:51:30.666
Time is
infinitely abundant. but...

674
00:51:30.708 --> 00:51:32.666
There's never enough of it.

675
00:51:37.833 --> 00:51:40.000
You have absolutely no idea.

676
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:43.583
Do you know
what kind of force it takes

677
00:51:43.625 --> 00:51:44.666
to drag today...

678
00:51:44.708 --> 00:51:47.875
To drag today into tomorrow?

679
00:51:47.916 --> 00:51:49.583
Incredible force.

680
00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:54.000
And today.
you made time work for you?

681
00:51:54.958 --> 00:51:56.458
I know.

682
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.208
All this was written
in the notebook

683
00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:00.500
you left behind
when you left us.

684
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.708
What the hell is going on here?

685
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:05.666
You'd understand
what is going on here

686
00:52:05.708 --> 00:52:09.166
if you'd been there
when Mom was dying.

687
00:52:11.541 --> 00:52:14.375
Remember? When you abandoned
your family.

688
00:52:14.416 --> 00:52:16.875
you told your kids
to always follow through.

689
00:52:16.916 --> 00:52:21.583
no matter what or who
should stand in their way.

690
00:52:21.625 --> 00:52:23.958
Well.
that's exactly what we did.

691
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.291
It's how we turned out
the monsters we are.

692
00:52:29.666 --> 00:52:31.000
Me and Jacob.

693
00:52:40.541 --> 00:52:41.875
Uncuff him!

694
00:52:43.291 --> 00:52:44.916
I'll talk to him alone.

695
00:53:02.916 --> 00:53:04.208
Ethan?

696
00:53:09.125 --> 00:53:10.291
But...

697
00:53:14.916 --> 00:53:17.208
But how is this possible?

698
00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:21.875
You are... a side effect
of the TAU engine.

699
00:53:23.375 --> 00:53:26.083
As quantanium gets produced.

700
00:53:26.125 --> 00:53:27.875
processed quant-particles
get released.

701
00:53:27.916 --> 00:53:30.458
Yeah. That's right.

702
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.041
They get dissolved in the air.

703
00:53:32.083 --> 00:53:34.500
No. they don't.

704
00:53:34.541 --> 00:53:38.041
They linger in the field.
the field that contains events.

705
00:53:38.083 --> 00:53:39.125
people...

706
00:53:39.166 --> 00:53:41.166
The truth is.
you're already gone.

707
00:53:41.208 --> 00:53:42.625
Yeah. that means...

708
00:53:42.666 --> 00:53:43.875
that means I did it!

709
00:53:44.916 --> 00:53:46.916
I really did it!

710
00:53:46.958 --> 00:53:48.875
What a striking opportunity!

711
00:53:51.916 --> 00:53:55.291
Do tell me.
The world must have changed.

712
00:53:57.958 --> 00:54:00.083
Is everybody using quantanium?

713
00:54:01.875 --> 00:54:03.166
Am I famous?

714
00:54:03.208 --> 00:54:06.000
You didn't come back.

715
00:54:08.375 --> 00:54:09.416
What?

716
00:54:09.458 --> 00:54:11.916
We never saw you again.

717
00:54:11.958 --> 00:54:15.500
Mom died. Jacob and I
grew up at an orphanage.

718
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.625
No! No.

719
00:54:19.916 --> 00:54:21.416
Don't be ridiculous!

720
00:54:23.791 --> 00:54:25.416
The launch went well!

721
00:54:25.458 --> 00:54:26.916
I'll be back soon.

722
00:54:26.958 --> 00:54:29.000
I have a travel date. look!

723
00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:32.166
Look! Going home in ten days!

724
00:54:32.208 --> 00:54:34.125
You never made it back.

725
00:54:34.166 --> 00:54:36.125
I should know.
it's been my life.

726
00:54:37.083 --> 00:54:39.000
What you did here destroyed you

727
00:54:39.041 --> 00:54:40.875
and everyone
who worked with you.

728
00:54:42.666 --> 00:54:47.166
And what I am about to create
will cause millions of deaths.

729
00:54:51.125 --> 00:54:52.791
No. Ethan. no.

730
00:54:52.833 --> 00:54:54.583
You're wrong.

731
00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:56.958
Even if
that's how it happened for you.

732
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.500
it will be different now.

733
00:54:58.541 --> 00:55:00.041
I will change everything.

734
00:55:00.083 --> 00:55:01.500
Tomorrow.
after the committee visit.

735
00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:03.041
I'll leave this place.

736
00:55:03.083 --> 00:55:04.500
I'll be home in two days!

737
00:55:04.541 --> 00:55:06.416
Will you listen to me?

738
00:55:06.458 --> 00:55:07.958
It already happened.

739
00:55:08.708 --> 00:55:11.375
Us meeting here today...

740
00:55:11.416 --> 00:55:13.125
it may have no purpose
other than to show me

741
00:55:13.166 --> 00:55:15.291
who I have become.

742
00:55:20.875 --> 00:55:22.291
- Professor!
- What was that?

743
00:55:22.333 --> 00:55:24.375
There's a large cloud
of fog of some kind.

744
00:55:24.416 --> 00:55:25.666
There's something inside it!

745
00:55:27.333 --> 00:55:29.791
Stay here. Ethan. Stay here.

746
00:55:31.458 --> 00:55:33.666
Hey. Dad! Dad?

747
00:55:33.708 --> 00:55:36.833
Wait! Dad! Dad!

748
00:56:30.375 --> 00:56:33.458
Get to the bunker!

749
00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:37.250
Everyone. to the bunker!

750
00:57:45.916 --> 00:57:48.208
The closer
the day of the launch.

751
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:50.166
the more anxious I feel.

752
00:57:51.416 --> 00:57:53.416
Are we doing the right thing?

753
00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:59.666
The professor has changed
so much lately.

754
00:57:59.708 --> 00:58:02.958
I don't think
you'd recognize him.

755
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.125
Instead of the dream to improve
the lives of all people.

756
00:58:06.166 --> 00:58:09.250
he talks more and more
about the power and glory

757
00:58:09.291 --> 00:58:11.083
that the new energy
will give him.

758
00:58:12.791 --> 00:58:14.208
I hope I'm wrong.

759
00:58:15.833 --> 00:58:18.416
Because if that is the case.

760
00:58:18.458 --> 00:58:20.458
I'm not entirely sure
that the TAU

761
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.708
will make the world
a better place.

762
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.291
Jacob! We shouldn't take
anything from this place!

763
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:49.666
What happened to you?

764
00:58:49.708 --> 00:58:51.041
What have you done?

765
00:58:52.166 --> 00:58:54.958
Why did you start it?

766
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.625
Ethan. we need to carry
as much quantanium as we can.

767
00:58:59.666 --> 00:59:01.416
It's worth billions.

768
00:59:01.458 --> 00:59:03.541
Think about the future
of our company.

769
00:59:03.583 --> 00:59:04.625
We have to stop this engine!

770
00:59:04.666 --> 00:59:06.125
No!

771
00:59:06.166 --> 00:59:07.916
I know who starts the war
in the future.

772
00:59:07.958 --> 00:59:10.625
We do! Blake Explorations!

773
00:59:10.666 --> 00:59:13.458
Everything starts today.
at this moment.

774
00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:15.541
- I saw it!
- I believe you.

775
00:59:15.583 --> 00:59:18.125
But now we know this. right?

776
00:59:18.166 --> 00:59:19.916
We won't let it happen.

777
00:59:19.958 --> 00:59:21.708
There's only one way to stop it.

778
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:23.208
by destroying the engine!

779
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:28.666
No. Tomorrow at 8 p.m..
the yacht will be here for us.

780
00:59:28.708 --> 00:59:30.541
Now we.
we'll get out of here

781
00:59:30.583 --> 00:59:32.750
and continue our father's work.

782
00:59:32.791 --> 00:59:35.500
Dad was killed by our drones.

783
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:37.166
We killed him. Jacob!

784
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.875
Quantanium was my dream.
you know that!

785
00:59:41.916 --> 00:59:44.166
But the time has come
to sacrifice it.

786
00:59:44.958 --> 00:59:47.416
No. Ethan. No.

787
00:59:47.458 --> 00:59:49.375
Always follow through
to the end.

788
00:59:49.416 --> 00:59:52.250
no matter what or who
should stand in your way.

789
00:59:55.333 --> 00:59:57.958
Ted. turn it off!

790
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.166
Without you.
he can't do anything!

791
01:00:01.541 --> 01:00:03.291
I'm sorry. Ethan.

792
01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.000
I have to think about my future.

793
01:00:06.375 --> 01:00:07.666
I have a daughter.

794
01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:15.458
You know...

795
01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:19.083
I'm sick of this.

796
01:00:23.583 --> 01:00:25.625
I have the TAU. I have Ted.

797
01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.250
I don't need you anymore.

798
01:00:30.416 --> 01:00:31.625
That's enough!

799
01:00:32.958 --> 01:00:34.125
You think
I'm going to keep silent?

800
01:00:34.166 --> 01:00:36.125
No. I won't! Here. take a look!

801
01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:38.708
I saw Ryan die
exactly like Ethan said!

802
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:40.916
The engine
should be switched off!

803
01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:45.125
Stay out of this!

804
01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:46.666
Start filming. Ethan!

805
01:00:46.708 --> 01:00:48.708
We're going to stop all this.

806
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:49.958
And as soon
as we are back online.

807
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.083
my millions of followers

808
01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:52.291
- will see this!
- No. no. no. no!

809
01:00:52.333 --> 01:00:54.750
Get back! You better get back!

810
01:00:54.791 --> 01:00:57.208
I said. get back!

811
01:00:58.041 --> 01:00:59.041
I don't care!

812
01:01:00.208 --> 01:01:01.250
Ryan gave his life for me.

813
01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:02.500
and you are not
going to stop me--

814
01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:19.750
What the hell?

815
01:01:19.791 --> 01:01:21.458
Neither am I.

816
01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.291
I'm not going to stop. Ever.

817
01:01:39.666 --> 01:01:41.125
You bastard!

818
01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:44.375
That's fine.

819
01:01:44.416 --> 01:01:46.791
We'll go and make
some quantanium in the meantime.

820
01:01:58.625 --> 01:01:59.625
Now...

821
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.416
I've become death.

822
01:02:06.041 --> 01:02:08.666
The destroyer of worlds.

823
01:02:11.791 --> 01:02:14.000
Elizabeth tried to warn me.

824
01:02:14.041 --> 01:02:16.875
And I've been so foolish.

825
01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:18.875
I spoke with soldiers
from the future!

826
01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:22.416
Millions are going to die.
and it's all because of us!

827
01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:26.500
Millions are going to die.
and it's all because of us!

828
01:02:26.541 --> 01:02:28.125
I've already told you.

829
01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:30.083
Yes. yes. yes.
we're all going to die.

830
01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:33.625
Yes. yes.
we're all going to die.

831
01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:35.333
... from the future.

832
01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:37.625
Millions are going to die.
and it's all because of us!

833
01:02:37.666 --> 01:02:39.791
I spoke with the soldiers
from the future!

834
01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:41.416
Millions of people will die!

835
01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:42.791
Why did you want
to destroy the TAU?

836
01:02:42.833 --> 01:02:45.833
Why did you want
to destroy the TAU?

837
01:02:45.875 --> 01:02:47.166
I've already told you!

838
01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:48.791
I've told you already!

839
01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:50.000
Yes. yes. yes.
we're all going to die.

840
01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:53.708
Yes. we're all going to die.

841
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.583
Where did you hide the quantanium?

842
01:02:56.541 --> 01:02:58.500
Tell us everything!

843
01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.333
There's no way
I'll tell you!

844
01:03:03.291 --> 01:03:07.583
Why did you want
to destroy the TAU? Why?

845
01:03:10.125 --> 01:03:12.166
Why did you want
to destroy the TAU?

846
01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:13.791
- I told you already!
- I told you already!

847
01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:16.791
Yes. yes. yes.
we're all going to die.

848
01:03:16.833 --> 01:03:18.125
But it's true!

849
01:03:18.166 --> 01:03:19.583
I spoke with soldiers
from the future!

850
01:03:19.625 --> 01:03:21.250
Yes. yes.

851
01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:24.083
we're all going to die.

852
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:27.625
I got it now!

853
01:03:27.666 --> 01:03:30.041
The quantanium is still
on the island.

854
01:03:30.083 --> 01:03:31.291
She hid it!

855
01:03:33.083 --> 01:03:34.833
The soldiers
were talking about it.

856
01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:37.541
that means
Tina knows where to look for it!

857
01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:40.958
Millions of people will die.
all because of us!

858
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
No. no. no!

859
01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:46.583
I have a plan!

860
01:03:46.625 --> 01:03:49.625
We'll do what Tina wanted.

861
01:03:49.666 --> 01:03:53.041
I understand how she planned
to destroy the TAU.

862
01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:55.416
If you take a vial
with quantanium

863
01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:58.083
and put it into the engine
and start producing

864
01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:01.416
new quantanium.
their energies will collide.

865
01:04:01.458 --> 01:04:02.791
causing an explosion.

866
01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:12.250
We'll put Smaug's own egg
under his butt!

867
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.791
I was in the castle
of the sorceress Tina

868
01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:19.791
at 8:49 p.m..

869
01:04:19.833 --> 01:04:22.000
and I saw
that she had already stolen

870
01:04:22.041 --> 01:04:23.250
Smaug's egg.

871
01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:27.375
which means she left the bunker
at about 8:40.

872
01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.666
We must not break
the magic crystals!

873
01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:34.416
They won't be able
to drive the fog away!

874
01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:36.208
Oh. great Gandalf!

875
01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:37.791
These crystals repulse the fog.

876
01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:40.458
but if you change
their polarity. they pull it in.

877
01:04:43.166 --> 01:04:46.166
Flee! Down the Road
of Yellow Bricks!

878
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.541
Hello. my dear Matt.

879
01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:54.458
I had no idea that
you can miss someone so much.

880
01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:55.833
I'm trying to convince
the professor

881
01:04:55.875 --> 01:04:57.958
that he needs two assistants.

882
01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.333
We'll see what happens.

883
01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:01.791
But while I'm alone.

884
01:05:01.833 --> 01:05:03.500
I'll continue
to answer your questions.

885
01:05:04.916 --> 01:05:06.750
As if we're already together.

886
01:05:06.791 --> 01:05:08.708
The professor got approval.

887
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.750
I'm flying to America with him!

888
01:05:10.791 --> 01:05:13.291
And we'll see each other soon.

889
01:05:13.333 --> 01:05:16.583
Over the last six months.
you've become like family to me.

890
01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:18.083
Although we've never met.

891
01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:20.541
and I've never even seen
a picture of you.

892
01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.333
But I'm sure our first date
will go down perfectly.

893
01:05:23.375 --> 01:05:24.750
It's even better this way.

894
01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:31.083
Although we've never met.

895
01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:32.708
and I've never even seen
a picture of you.

896
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:33.875
It's even better this way.

897
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:39.458
It's even better this way.

898
01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.625
Hands up!

899
01:07:10.666 --> 01:07:13.875
Easy! Easy! Easy?

900
01:07:15.333 --> 01:07:17.041
Oh! A foreigner!

901
01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:19.583
You want to have a drink? Hey!

902
01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:28.416
What the--

903
01:07:28.875 --> 01:07:29.958
What?

904
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:41.541
Did that make you feel
like a Bond girl just now?

905
01:07:41.583 --> 01:07:42.708
Who the hell are you?

906
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:44.041
We've met before
in your dream.

907
01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:45.875
Did you forget me so quickly?

908
01:07:45.916 --> 01:07:48.375
In my dreams?

909
01:07:48.416 --> 01:07:50.708
You told me yourself
in your letters.

910
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.708
Matt?

911
01:07:57.791 --> 01:07:59.375
Is this really you?

912
01:07:59.416 --> 01:08:01.625
It is me!

913
01:08:01.666 --> 01:08:05.375
I couldn't even imagine
I would see you here.

914
01:08:05.416 --> 01:08:07.875
They're looking for you.
Let's get you to a safe place.

915
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:11.500
Let's hide here!

916
01:08:15.916 --> 01:08:17.833
- Matt?
- What?

917
01:08:20.666 --> 01:08:22.458
This is not how I imagined
our meeting.

918
01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:26.583
Want to improvise?

919
01:08:27.375 --> 01:08:28.375
Matt. listen.

920
01:08:30.166 --> 01:08:31.541
I did something.

921
01:08:33.458 --> 01:08:35.750
Something they'll never
forgive me for.

922
01:08:35.791 --> 01:08:38.416
I know. About the quantanium.
and everything else.

923
01:08:39.708 --> 01:08:40.875
You heard?

924
01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:43.666
And I do believe you.
and I want to help!

925
01:08:43.708 --> 01:08:48.541
Matt... I just don't want
to drag you into this.

926
01:08:48.583 --> 01:08:51.958
Listen. I'm so glad you're here.

927
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.500
But this is such bad timing.

928
01:08:54.791 --> 01:08:56.208
We don't choose the time.

929
01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:59.416
but we can decide who we are
in the time that chose us.

930
01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:03.666
We will make things right!

931
01:09:03.708 --> 01:09:06.333
We can save the day.

932
01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.916
They didn't take away
the quantanium. did they?

933
01:09:09.916 --> 01:09:12.208
No. I hid it.

934
01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:16.000
Perfect! I will help you
with your plan.

935
01:09:16.041 --> 01:09:20.250
Matt. are you sure
you want to do this?

936
01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:22.958
You admired
Henry Blake's ideas so much.

937
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.250
He believed
that he was changing the world

938
01:09:27.291 --> 01:09:28.333
for the better.

939
01:09:28.375 --> 01:09:31.416
But he made
his loved ones suffer.

940
01:09:31.458 --> 01:09:33.750
You are the only one
who can change it.

941
01:09:33.791 --> 01:09:35.125
I'm here to help!

942
01:09:36.458 --> 01:09:38.458
Just tell me
where you hid the quantanium.

943
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.666
I can get it.

944
01:09:40.708 --> 01:09:42.875
They're looking for you.
but they won't suspect me.

945
01:09:50.708 --> 01:09:51.833
Where is it. Tina?

946
01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:56.666
It's in the village.

947
01:09:58.625 --> 01:09:59.958
But we can't go now.

948
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.458
They're still celebrating.
someone will notice me.

949
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.541
Well. let's wait here

950
01:10:06.583 --> 01:10:08.541
until the morning.

951
01:10:21.708 --> 01:10:25.208
How did you talk Henry Blake
into inviting you to the island?

952
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:29.000
It wasn't that easy.
but I have a way with words.

953
01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:33.458
It's like I'm dreaming.

954
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:36.333
Who knows?
Maybe it is a wonderful dream.

955
01:10:38.458 --> 01:10:39.791
Do you believe in destiny?

956
01:10:42.791 --> 01:10:44.458
I guess I do now.

957
01:10:48.458 --> 01:10:50.041
I feel so safe with you.

958
01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.666
Look how wonderful
the stars are tonight.

959
01:10:59.375 --> 01:11:00.791
Do you see Sirius?

960
01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:02.708
The brightest in the night sky.

961
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:06.583
One of the closest stars
to Earth.

962
01:11:07.666 --> 01:11:08.958
And this is Vega.

963
01:11:10.083 --> 01:11:11.833
The sailors are guided by it.

964
01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:18.708
It's on the right side
of the triangular constellation.

965
01:11:20.375 --> 01:11:22.916
It's called
the Autumn-Summer Triang...

966
01:11:49.125 --> 01:11:51.958
Rob! Rob!

967
01:11:53.958 --> 01:11:56.041
Wait. wait! What does he
have to do with any of this?

968
01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:57.458
Robert!

969
01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:00.041
- Tina?
- Give it back.

970
01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:02.666
Tina. I don't understand.

971
01:12:02.708 --> 01:12:05.333
Rob. it's all right.
he's a friend.

972
01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:07.791
Hold on. you gave
the quantanium to a kid?

973
01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:10.458
Tina. what are you
talking about?

974
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.750
Rob. this is no time for joking.

975
01:12:12.791 --> 01:12:14.166
At the celebration
after the launch.

976
01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:16.791
I put the quantanium
into your backpack.

977
01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.208
The launch isn't till tonight.

978
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:22.166
Rob. the launch
has already happened!

979
01:12:22.208 --> 01:12:24.166
The launch is only
about to happen.

980
01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:26.500
Crap! Of course!

981
01:12:26.541 --> 01:12:28.291
The day in the fog is changing.

982
01:12:28.333 --> 01:12:31.166
At... at 4 a.m.

983
01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:33.916
So now it's the morning
before the launch!

984
01:12:33.958 --> 01:12:35.875
Matt. what do you mean?

985
01:12:35.916 --> 01:12:37.083
I'm going now. sweetie.

986
01:12:37.125 --> 01:12:39.083
I'll see you
after the engine launch.

987
01:12:39.125 --> 01:12:40.458
Bye. Mom.

988
01:12:58.625 --> 01:13:00.500
- Hi. Kate.
- Oh. hi. Tina.

989
01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:02.541
I almost slept in.

990
01:13:02.583 --> 01:13:04.583
Do they really need us
this early?

991
01:13:06.166 --> 01:13:09.125
No one sleeps.
since the professor can't sleep.

992
01:13:10.208 --> 01:13:13.333
This is... this is impossible!

993
01:13:13.375 --> 01:13:15.041
Calm... calm down!

994
01:13:15.083 --> 01:13:17.500
This is impossible! This is...

995
01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:19.750
You are not Matt. right?

996
01:13:19.791 --> 01:13:20.875
You are not Matt?

997
01:13:20.916 --> 01:13:22.666
You are not Matt? Just tell me!

998
01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:24.333
I thought
it would be better this way.

999
01:13:26.125 --> 01:13:27.416
Tina!

1000
01:13:29.833 --> 01:13:31.125
Stop!

1001
01:13:31.166 --> 01:13:32.208
Stop!

1002
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:33.500
Let me go!

1003
01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:35.458
I can't.
otherwise you'll disappear!

1004
01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.333
How is this even possible?
Why am I there?

1005
01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:38.916
Let me explain
everything to you!

1006
01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:40.583
Is this because
of the TAU engine?

1007
01:13:40.625 --> 01:13:42.083
Did the testing begin?

1008
01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:43.333
Is this some kind
of a system failure?

1009
01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:45.041
I'm from the future!

1010
01:13:45.083 --> 01:13:46.458
What?

1011
01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:47.958
I'm Henry Blake's son.

1012
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.166
His son?

1013
01:13:49.208 --> 01:13:51.208
What you have seen
in the future. the war.

1014
01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:52.750
will happen because of me.

1015
01:13:52.791 --> 01:13:54.291
I didn't know this.
and I want to stop it.

1016
01:13:54.333 --> 01:13:55.666
that's why I lied
and told you I was Matt

1017
01:13:55.708 --> 01:13:57.750
so you would tell me
where you hid the quantanium.

1018
01:13:57.791 --> 01:13:59.708
I'm sorry I lied.
I know you hate lies.

1019
01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:01.708
but I've listened
to your recordings.

1020
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:02.833
and I almost fell in love.

1021
01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:04.541
This is impossible!

1022
01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:06.333
I don't believe a single word!

1023
01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:09.583
I know it's hard for you
to trust me now. but...

1024
01:14:09.625 --> 01:14:11.541
but I know who you will believe.

1025
01:14:11.583 --> 01:14:13.375
Who is it?

1026
01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:15.791
Don't worry. You know him.

1027
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.291
Let's go.

1028
01:14:20.833 --> 01:14:24.666
Hey. buddy!
I want you to meet someone.

1029
01:14:26.041 --> 01:14:28.458
Rob's mom
didn't recognize him again.

1030
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:31.250
And she left
without saying goodbye.

1031
01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:34.208
It's so tactless!

1032
01:14:36.916 --> 01:14:41.416
♪ How many miles to Babylon? ♪

1033
01:14:41.458 --> 01:14:44.333
♪ Three score miles and ten ♪

1034
01:14:48.375 --> 01:14:51.916
♪ Can I get there
By candle-light? ♪

1035
01:14:52.916 --> 01:14:54.583
♪ Yes. and back again! ♪

1036
01:14:54.625 --> 01:14:55.750
Robert!

1037
01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:00.875
Tina. you recognize me?

1038
01:15:00.916 --> 01:15:02.333
Yes. of course.

1039
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:07.250
I did as you told me.

1040
01:15:08.708 --> 01:15:11.291
I never. ever opened it.

1041
01:15:33.041 --> 01:15:34.666
So all of this is true.

1042
01:15:36.333 --> 01:15:41.166
If Rob got older.
then this is the future.

1043
01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:47.375
But... why did the time
get mixed up?

1044
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.208
Did I travel to the future or...

1045
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:53.541
did you end up here?

1046
01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:55.041
And why is there another me?

1047
01:15:56.625 --> 01:15:58.833
You didn't travel in time. Tina.

1048
01:15:58.875 --> 01:16:01.708
You only exist in a mass
of processed quantum particles.

1049
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:03.750
to me they look like a fog.
but you can't see it.

1050
01:16:03.791 --> 01:16:05.166
Look!

1051
01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:08.208
This device allows me to attract

1052
01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:10.750
a field of quantum particles
and keep it

1053
01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:12.541
within a radius of 100 meters.

1054
01:16:14.458 --> 01:16:15.625
I got you out of the main field.

1055
01:16:15.666 --> 01:16:17.583
that's why
you haven't disappeared yet.

1056
01:16:17.625 --> 01:16:21.125
The day in the fog
started all over again. and...

1057
01:16:21.166 --> 01:16:22.958
Now it looks like
the events have gone back

1058
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.791
to the morning of August 22nd.

1059
01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:28.625
That's why you saw another you.
the other.

1060
01:16:28.666 --> 01:16:29.791
before the TAU launch.

1061
01:16:32.041 --> 01:16:33.541
So I'm like...

1062
01:16:35.041 --> 01:16:36.500
a ghost?

1063
01:16:36.541 --> 01:16:40.750
You are a quantum variant.
a possible version of yourself.

1064
01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:45.708
Where did you get this?

1065
01:16:47.916 --> 01:16:49.666
From my parents.

1066
01:16:53.958 --> 01:16:54.958
Look.

1067
01:17:05.166 --> 01:17:07.125
It's the same.

1068
01:17:07.166 --> 01:17:10.166
It's not "the same".
It's the one.

1069
01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.583
What is that?

1070
01:17:19.625 --> 01:17:20.875
I don't know.

1071
01:17:30.875 --> 01:17:32.166
Hello. Ethan.

1072
01:17:34.291 --> 01:17:38.333
If you are watching this.
it means I'm dead.

1073
01:17:38.375 --> 01:17:40.208
and you've found the TAU.

1074
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:42.250
Forgive me for luring you here.

1075
01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.375
You had to see
everything for yourself.

1076
01:17:45.125 --> 01:17:47.041
I'm Tina Morozova.

1077
01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:49.958
assistant to your father.
Henry Blake.

1078
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.250
If you came here.
you've seen your father.

1079
01:17:53.291 --> 01:17:55.166
maybe even me as a young woman.

1080
01:17:55.208 --> 01:17:56.750
But most importantly.

1081
01:17:56.791 --> 01:17:59.208
you've seen
what our experiments led to.

1082
01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:02.500
When we launched the TAU.
the fog wrapped this place.

1083
01:18:02.541 --> 01:18:06.083
and within the fog.
there was a day from the future.

1084
01:18:06.125 --> 01:18:07.583
a day of the war.

1085
01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:10.750
The military destroyed
this place.

1086
01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:11.791
but I was lucky.

1087
01:18:12.708 --> 01:18:14.625
I survived.

1088
01:18:14.666 --> 01:18:17.166
Tina Morozova died.

1089
01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:19.875
Elizabeth Paulsen appeared.

1090
01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:25.250
It fell into chaos. and...

1091
01:18:25.291 --> 01:18:27.375
our experiment was forgotten.

1092
01:18:27.416 --> 01:18:28.833
It was no longer a priority.

1093
01:18:29.708 --> 01:18:31.916
So. I decided to find you.

1094
01:18:34.875 --> 01:18:37.291
There was only one way
to stop you.

1095
01:18:43.458 --> 01:18:44.833
But I couldn't do it.

1096
01:18:46.333 --> 01:18:47.375
Hi.

1097
01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:49.750
Good afternoon.

1098
01:18:55.166 --> 01:18:56.416
Hey. buddy!

1099
01:18:57.625 --> 01:19:00.791
I see that you're an inventor?

1100
01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:02.166
I wanted to try and raise you

1101
01:19:02.208 --> 01:19:03.958
a different person.

1102
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.208
And I think that I've managed
to change something in you.

1103
01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:08.208
You are special. Ethan.

1104
01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:09.958
So if she...

1105
01:19:11.708 --> 01:19:12.750
is me...

1106
01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.625
that means I'm already dead.

1107
01:19:20.375 --> 01:19:21.916
This is such a weird feeling.

1108
01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:27.250
I don't even know what I am.

1109
01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:31.208
You are my last hope
to destroy the TAU

1110
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:32.541
and change the future.

1111
01:19:33.041 --> 01:19:34.041
But how?

1112
01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:38.750
Today. my brother Jacob
will carry with him

1113
01:19:38.791 --> 01:19:41.625
off the island the technology
for the TAU engine.

1114
01:19:41.666 --> 01:19:43.833
And it is much more powerful
and dangerous

1115
01:19:43.875 --> 01:19:47.041
than the technology I use
to get my quantanium.

1116
01:19:47.083 --> 01:19:49.416
It's literally a Pandora's box.

1117
01:19:49.458 --> 01:19:51.333
But what do you plan on doing?

1118
01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:53.375
I want to finish
what you started.

1119
01:19:53.416 --> 01:19:55.208
I will get to the bunker
and draw the fog

1120
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:56.750
at the moment of the launch.

1121
01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:58.375
You've been on site.
so you know exactly

1122
01:19:58.416 --> 01:19:59.583
how it happened.

1123
01:19:59.625 --> 01:20:01.416
The TAU shouldn't get out
into the world.

1124
01:20:01.458 --> 01:20:02.916
We have to destroy it.

1125
01:20:07.833 --> 01:20:08.958
All right.

1126
01:20:12.791 --> 01:20:14.750
But I'll be the one
to blow up the TAU.

1127
01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:16.416
It's personal.

1128
01:20:17.708 --> 01:20:20.541
Either way.
I don't really exist. so...

1129
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:23.708
nothing can happen to me.

1130
01:20:27.625 --> 01:20:30.208
So this means
I will vanish soon.

1131
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.750
There's plenty of time
until eight.

1132
01:20:38.916 --> 01:20:41.833
But I was so looking forward
to this day.

1133
01:20:41.875 --> 01:20:46.000
I even brought a dress with me
for the celebration.

1134
01:20:48.041 --> 01:20:50.416
This sounds
so foolish right now.

1135
01:20:50.458 --> 01:20:51.708
No. it's not.

1136
01:20:54.333 --> 01:20:56.958
Look. here's a stage.

1137
01:20:57.458 --> 01:20:58.458
Music.

1138
01:20:59.166 --> 01:21:00.583
You want to dance?

1139
01:21:32.250 --> 01:21:35.041
But you and I
are alike. Ethan.

1140
01:21:37.458 --> 01:21:39.416
I know
what you're feeling right now.

1141
01:21:41.208 --> 01:21:45.250
Quantanium was your dream.
and now you have to destroy it.

1142
01:21:45.291 --> 01:21:47.000
I went through this.

1143
01:21:47.041 --> 01:21:49.583
Realizing that your dream
will destroy the world.

1144
01:21:49.625 --> 01:21:52.250
it's not easy.

1145
01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:54.666
And I believe that you'll make
the right choice.

1146
01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:30.958
This is all very silly
and inappropriate!

1147
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.583
But your manners
are nothing new to me.

1148
01:22:33.625 --> 01:22:35.791
Mary Poppins is back.

1149
01:22:38.833 --> 01:22:41.250
Practically perfect
in every way!

1150
01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:44.458
But all good things
come to an end.

1151
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:48.250
The wind's in the West!

1152
01:22:49.666 --> 01:22:52.083
People will gather here soon.

1153
01:22:52.125 --> 01:22:53.541
Let's go
to Henry Blake's house.

1154
01:22:53.583 --> 01:22:55.291
He'll be in the bunker all day.

1155
01:22:55.333 --> 01:22:56.916
Nobody will disturb us.

1156
01:22:59.416 --> 01:23:01.041
We'll be docking in a few minutes.

1157
01:23:02.416 --> 01:23:04.791
Great. You'll find us
in a bunker.

1158
01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:06.916
It's in the middle
of an abandoned camp.

1159
01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.125
We're locked in.

1160
01:23:09.166 --> 01:23:11.625
you'll need to open
the metal hatch.

1161
01:23:11.666 --> 01:23:13.666
We're carrying
some precious cargo.

1162
01:23:13.708 --> 01:23:16.000
Please provide security.

1163
01:23:16.041 --> 01:23:18.250
And here's the thing...

1164
01:23:18.291 --> 01:23:21.416
This whole mission.
emergency landing.

1165
01:23:21.458 --> 01:23:23.000
losing quantanium...

1166
01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:25.416
It affected Ethan.

1167
01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:27.750
I'm afraid he lost it.

1168
01:23:28.958 --> 01:23:30.958
There was a terrible incident.

1169
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.083
He killed the journalist.

1170
01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:36.833
If you see him.
please be careful.

1171
01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:37.958
Understood.

1172
01:23:50.666 --> 01:23:52.250
It's time to get out of here.

1173
01:23:56.041 --> 01:23:57.500
We need to take everything.

1174
01:24:04.291 --> 01:24:08.000
So. by 8 p.m.
we go down to the bunker

1175
01:24:08.041 --> 01:24:11.000
and put a quantanium flask
inside the receiving container.

1176
01:24:11.041 --> 01:24:13.916
But for this. we need to know
minute by minute.

1177
01:24:13.958 --> 01:24:17.250
where everybody was
before the TAU launch.

1178
01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:18.375
The professor and the committee

1179
01:24:18.416 --> 01:24:19.833
entered the TAU's control center

1180
01:24:19.875 --> 01:24:22.875
at 7:30 p.m. and remained there
until the launch.

1181
01:24:22.916 --> 01:24:24.125
All systems were tested.

1182
01:24:24.166 --> 01:24:25.875
they didn't have
a minute to spare.

1183
01:24:25.916 --> 01:24:28.208
And where were you
at that moment?

1184
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:31.708
From 7:35 until 7:50.
I was near the engine

1185
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.000
with the scientists.

1186
01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:35.333
We were preparing
the TAU for launch.

1187
01:24:35.375 --> 01:24:38.625
We'll enter
the engine compartment at 7:50.

1188
01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:45.541
Jacob and Ted will probably try
to take out the quantanium.

1189
01:24:45.583 --> 01:24:47.000
In the bunker.
everyone will be busy.

1190
01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:49.708
so no one
will pay attention to them.

1191
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.583
There's a guard at the entrance.

1192
01:24:51.625 --> 01:24:54.416
You can't get inside
without raising suspicion.

1193
01:24:54.458 --> 01:24:55.916
But I can.

1194
01:24:55.958 --> 01:24:57.666
But being the only one
near the TAU.

1195
01:24:57.708 --> 01:24:59.625
I'll be in full view.

1196
01:24:59.666 --> 01:25:02.125
I can only switch the flasks
while the scientists are there.

1197
01:25:02.166 --> 01:25:04.791
so I have to get there earlier.

1198
01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.375
The main thing is
not to be noticed

1199
01:25:06.416 --> 01:25:07.833
by the second me.

1200
01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:09.458
Warning.

1201
01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:10.875
System activated.

1202
01:25:11.666 --> 01:25:13.083
Clear launch area.

1203
01:25:14.083 --> 01:25:16.125
Stand by for pre-launch.

1204
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:23.875
At 7:55. the TAU
will be fully ready for launch.

1205
01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:25.500
We'll only need
to press the button.

1206
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.666
I'll start the engine
to create a distraction.

1207
01:25:43.125 --> 01:25:44.208
What's happening?

1208
01:25:45.833 --> 01:25:48.500
Who is it? Who is it?

1209
01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:50.750
Ring the alarm!

1210
01:25:50.791 --> 01:25:52.416
And stop Jacob and Ted.

1211
01:25:56.625 --> 01:25:57.958
Intruders!

1212
01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.333
They got the quantanium!
Get them! Get them!

1213
01:26:06.083 --> 01:26:07.625
After starting up.

1214
01:26:07.666 --> 01:26:10.166
the engine needs to run
for 20 minutes.

1215
01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:13.750
And throughout this time.
no one should get in.

1216
01:26:13.791 --> 01:26:15.333
I will block the door
to the TAU.

1217
01:26:21.666 --> 01:26:23.125
For good luck.

1218
01:26:23.166 --> 01:26:24.708
At 20 minutes past eight.

1219
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:27.125
the engine will start producing
new quantanium.

1220
01:26:27.166 --> 01:26:31.458
Their energies will collide.
and the TAU will be destroyed.

1221
01:27:09.875 --> 01:27:10.875
Damn it!

1222
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:23.750
Ethan's got the key.

1223
01:27:57.833 --> 01:27:59.458
Jacob. it's over!

1224
01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.875
I put a full flask of
quantanium inside the receiver.

1225
01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:03.708
In 20 minutes. it will explode.

1226
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:04.791
What have you done?

1227
01:28:04.833 --> 01:28:06.458
We need to stop this!
Give me the key!

1228
01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:07.708
You've seen the war!

1229
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:09.208
This is what it led to!

1230
01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:10.416
If the quantanium
gets into the world.

1231
01:28:10.458 --> 01:28:11.750
it will end like this.
Either way.

1232
01:28:11.791 --> 01:28:13.458
we have to destroy the TAU!

1233
01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.333
Listen to me!

1234
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:25.166
- On your knees!
- On your knees!

1235
01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:27.250
On your knees!
I'll kill you. you bastard!

1236
01:28:27.291 --> 01:28:28.833
How did you even get here?

1237
01:28:28.875 --> 01:28:30.708
- He's a civilian!
- It's Jacob Blake!

1238
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:32.541
Jacob Blake is an old man!

1239
01:28:32.583 --> 01:28:33.666
- Then he's a temporal!
- Wait!

1240
01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:34.750
You are wrong!

1241
01:28:34.791 --> 01:28:36.416
No. I recognize you.

1242
01:28:36.458 --> 01:28:37.583
You'll pay for everything!

1243
01:28:37.625 --> 01:28:38.708
For what?

1244
01:28:39.875 --> 01:28:41.333
That's my wife and kid!

1245
01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:43.375
They died because of you
and your brother!

1246
01:28:50.583 --> 01:28:52.208
Do you see now?

1247
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:54.625
We need to put an end to this!

1248
01:28:54.666 --> 01:28:56.416
This won't happen!

1249
01:28:56.458 --> 01:28:57.958
It already happened!

1250
01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.333
Look around!

1251
01:28:59.375 --> 01:29:01.875
Was this our father's dream?

1252
01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:04.750
Hands up!

1253
01:30:06.625 --> 01:30:08.708
You want to have a drink?

1254
01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:31.750
Hold it! Don't move!

1255
01:30:32.666 --> 01:30:33.750
Grab him!

1256
01:32:25.125 --> 01:32:26.375
All of this...

1257
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:28.958
is because of us!

1258
01:32:36.916 --> 01:32:40.875
Ted. throw me the gun!

1259
01:32:40.916 --> 01:32:44.000
Right in front of you! Throw it!

1260
01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:52.916
Throw me the gun!

1261
01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:54.458
I have to stop you.

1262
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:57.208
For my daughter!

1263
01:33:28.125 --> 01:33:29.583
I'll fix everything.

1264
01:34:09.041 --> 01:34:11.166
My name is Ethan Blake.

1265
01:34:11.208 --> 01:34:13.208
A very wise friend once told me.

1266
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:16.458
"Don't waste your time in vain."

1267
01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.416
My whole life.
I had a sense of purpose.

1268
01:34:19.458 --> 01:34:23.625
continuing my father's work.
trying to defeat time.

1269
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.833
But we were both wrong.

1270
01:34:27.875 --> 01:34:31.750
Destiny is determined
by what we strive for.

1271
01:34:31.791 --> 01:34:34.083
What is the use of victories

1272
01:34:34.125 --> 01:34:36.750
if there is no one
to share them with?

1273
01:34:36.791 --> 01:34:40.500
The most important thing
is the people around us.

1274
01:34:41.708 --> 01:34:44.916
Family. friends.

1275
01:34:44.958 --> 01:34:48.083
I only realized this
after I lost them all.

1276
01:34:49.541 --> 01:34:51.041
But every moment in time

1277
01:34:51.083 --> 01:34:53.166
is a new chance
to change everything.

1278
01:34:54.583 --> 01:34:57.333
Fate is the path to the unknown.

1279
01:34:58.541 --> 01:35:00.375
I leave it with you.

1280
01:35:00.416 --> 01:35:03.125
Destroy everything
that is left of my work

1281
01:35:03.166 --> 01:35:05.833
and never return to it
in the future.

1282
01:35:05.875 --> 01:35:07.250
And I...

1283
01:35:07.291 --> 01:35:09.625
I will destroy the one thing
I have here.

1284
01:36:11.333 --> 01:36:12.333
Dad?

1285
01:36:16.291 --> 01:36:18.041
Am I in hell?

1286
01:36:22.958 --> 01:36:27.541
Don't launch the TAU!
Don't launch the TAU!

1287
01:36:27.583 --> 01:36:30.125
Don't launch the TAU!

1288
01:36:32.041 --> 01:36:33.666
Come closer.

1289
01:36:33.708 --> 01:36:35.666
A video broadcast
from the future.

1290
01:36:43.333 --> 01:36:47.416
I suggested that. theoretically.

1291
01:36:47.458 --> 01:36:50.708
the TAU could teleport
substances through time. but...

1292
01:36:51.708 --> 01:36:53.666
teleporting a human?

1293
01:36:53.708 --> 01:36:55.500
I haven't shown you
everything yet.

1294
01:36:57.041 --> 01:36:58.166
Come take a look!

1295
01:37:13.916 --> 01:37:15.333
My life's work.

1296
01:37:16.166 --> 01:37:17.875
So much time wasted...

1297
01:37:23.875 --> 01:37:26.000
Your family is waiting.

1298
01:37:26.041 --> 01:37:27.750
I was told you have two boys.

1299
01:37:28.416 --> 01:37:29.416
Yes.

1300
01:37:30.625 --> 01:37:32.291
They're a year apart.

1301
01:37:34.083 --> 01:37:36.250
Wonderful boys.

1302
01:37:36.291 --> 01:37:38.000
Imagine how happy they will be.

1303
01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.125
And don't tell them that
the most important thing in life

1304
01:37:42.166 --> 01:37:43.208
is to follow through no matter

1305
01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:44.958
what should stand in the way.

1306
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.625
How do you know I say that?

1307
01:37:46.666 --> 01:37:48.375
Just a guess! Don't.

1308
01:37:50.375 --> 01:37:52.333
♪ How many miles to Babylon? ♪

1309
01:37:52.375 --> 01:37:54.583
- ♪ Three score miles and ten ♪
- ♪ Three score miles and ten ♪

1310
01:37:54.625 --> 01:37:55.958
You know this song?

1311
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.958
I heard it. In another life.

1312
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.625
♪ Can I get there
By candle-light? ♪

1313
01:38:01.666 --> 01:38:03.041
Do you mind?

1314
01:38:07.208 --> 01:38:09.125
So you said I really helped you.

1315
01:38:09.791 --> 01:38:11.208
You did.

1316
01:38:12.916 --> 01:38:14.875
But how did I end up
in the future?

1317
01:38:14.916 --> 01:38:16.708
It's a long story.

1318
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:19.250
I can tell you
on our first date.

1319
01:38:21.333 --> 01:38:24.708
I'm sorry.
but I already have a date.

1320
01:38:26.083 --> 01:38:28.250
You've never even met the guy.

1321
01:38:28.291 --> 01:38:30.458
What if he's not your type?
Or married?

1322
01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:32.958
And I'm here.
Single and stunning.

1323
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.250
Handsome and... humble?

1324
01:38:57.291 --> 01:39:00.791
Five. four.

1325
01:39:00.833 --> 01:39:04.208
three. two. one.

1326
01:39:25.708 --> 01:39:27.291
Ethan! Come here!

1327
01:39:31.916 --> 01:39:33.916
- Ethan. Jacob!
- Can't catch me!

1328
01:39:33.958 --> 01:39:35.000
- Four. three...
- Catch me

1329
01:39:35.041 --> 01:39:36.541
if you can.

1330
01:39:36.583 --> 01:39:37.708
That's the biggest snowball

1331
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:38.958
I've ever seen!

1332
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.791
He got you!

1333
01:39:40.833 --> 01:39:42.208
Hey.
be careful. boys.

1334
01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:43.750
Look at me. Daddy!

1335
01:39:50.541 --> 01:39:51.875
Mommy. Mommy.
look at this!

1336
01:39:51.916 --> 01:39:52.916
Are you hungry?

1337
01:39:53.958 --> 01:39:55.166
Now come on. boys.

1338
01:39:55.208 --> 01:39:56.708
Let's go and get some dinner.

1339
01:39:59.708 --> 01:40:02.041
Something tells me
he won't give up

1340
01:40:02.083 --> 01:40:05.250
and will continue his research.

1341
01:40:05.291 --> 01:40:07.083
I think he'll come up
with something new.

1342
01:40:09.875 --> 01:40:11.041
And...

1343
01:40:11.916 --> 01:40:13.333
what are we going to do?

1344
01:40:14.333 --> 01:40:15.666
We will look after him.

1345
01:40:18.708 --> 01:40:20.208
So. how's Matt?

1346
01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:21.791
Did you finally meet him?

1347
01:40:23.625 --> 01:40:26.666
Um... Actually...

1348
01:40:27.833 --> 01:40:29.333
I think he's not my type.

1349
01:40:29.375 --> 01:40:31.083
Of course.

1350
01:40:32.583 --> 01:40:33.875
He doesn't know
all the World Cup winners

1351
01:40:33.916 --> 01:40:35.375
for all the years to come.
