I have
to do it again.

10
00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:15.075
I see no other way.

11
00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:43.146
If you could see
what I see...

12
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:45.888
the way
that I see it...

13
00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:49.065
you would understand.

14
00:01:57.421 --> 00:01:59.380
It's all
about perception.

15
00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:11.479
An entire school of thought
exists claiming...

16
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:16.310
explaining that reality

17
00:02:16.353 --> 00:02:18.529
is just a series
of perceptions.

18
00:02:21.576 --> 00:02:23.491
Now. if that were true.

19
00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:25.145
don't you think
you could change it?

20
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.150
I'm going to.

21
00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.806
You see. I believe--

22
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.462
I know
it's all locked in space.

23
00:02:40.725 --> 00:02:42.597
It's all
still happening.

24
00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:52.650
It's like a record.

25
00:02:52.694 --> 00:02:55.740
When it's playing.
it's happening.

26
00:02:57.525 --> 00:02:59.266
It's a story
that's alive.

27
00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:02.051
Like it has life.

00:03:05.968 --> 00:03:08.753
♪ The end of the world

29
00:03:08.797 --> 00:03:10.538
But it's not.

30
00:03:13.628 --> 00:03:15.020
It's locked.

31
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.155
Frozen in the wind.

32
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.678
From the very
same time...

33
00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.290
and it's always there.

34
00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:24.813
just sitting.

35
00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:31.385
Trapped.

36
00:03:57.106 --> 00:03:59.239
Reality
is like a record.

37
00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:04.983
The trick is...

38
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:07.595
getting it
to play again.

39
00:04:19.476 --> 00:04:20.912
Miss Derkins.

40
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.088
He'll see you now.

41
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.060
Hey. Natalie.

42
00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:39.540
Glad you could make it
this week.

43
00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:45.763
I want
to do it again.

44
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.331
I know you do.

45
00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:50.377
But I know--

46
00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:52.857
You know
that's not real.

47
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.817
Not something
you can do. anyway.

48
00:04:57.906 --> 00:04:59.386
Listen.

49
00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:01.866
Take a breath.
Close your eyes.

50
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.825
It's only an exercise.

51
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:24.846
Good.
What do you see?

52
00:05:26.282 --> 00:05:27.805
You know
what I see.

53
00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:41.863
It's the same
every time.

54
00:05:43.734 --> 00:05:45.562
The hill--

55
00:05:45.606 --> 00:05:48.086
You're holding.
you know you are.

56
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.437
-Why?
-I just want to do it again.

57
00:05:51.568 --> 00:05:53.657
I know.
I know.

58
00:05:54.615 --> 00:05:56.181
Now. let's just
get back to--

59
00:05:56.225 --> 00:05:58.053
Have you ever heard
of George Berkeley?

60
00:05:58.096 --> 00:06:00.708
Um. yeah.

61
00:06:02.057 --> 00:06:03.928
Yes. Berkeley.

62
00:06:03.972 --> 00:06:06.757
-Well. he said--
-"To be is to be perceived."

63
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:07.889
Right.

64
00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:12.763
Basically.
it's this whole thing about

65
00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:15.897
how nothing actually exists
unless there's somebody

66
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.377
who's actively
perceiving it.

67
00:06:20.945 --> 00:06:22.425
But how would
that work?

68
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:25.428
I mean.
the rocks in the woods.

69
00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:29.693
Well. Berkeley said
there's a great perceiver.

70
00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:32.435
-God?
-No.

71
00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:35.569
God's too passive.

72
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.919
I think that we--

73
00:06:39.703 --> 00:06:41.966
I think that people
are actively perceiving

74
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.055
their own reality
into existence.

75
00:06:46.014 --> 00:06:47.363
So there is no God.

76
00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:52.499
We're all gods.

77
00:07:12.954 --> 00:07:14.434
I just want
to do it again.

78
00:07:36.673 --> 00:07:38.370
You shouldn't smoke.

79
00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:39.981
It's cheaper
than therapy.

80
00:07:41.678 --> 00:07:43.506
So tell me more
about this perception.

81
00:07:48.206 --> 00:07:49.556
Kind of over it.

82
00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:52.863
-You're afraid of what I write?
-No.

83
00:07:54.865 --> 00:07:56.345
Okay.

84
00:07:58.521 --> 00:07:59.609
What?

85
00:08:00.567 --> 00:08:02.220
It bothers you.

86
00:08:02.264 --> 00:08:03.570
Nothing bothers me.

87
00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:07.487
Natalie. unless I'm confused.
you want to be God.

88
00:08:08.183 --> 00:08:09.663
Something must be
bothering you.

89
00:08:12.056 --> 00:08:14.406
I want to be in control
of my own reality.

90
00:08:15.756 --> 00:08:17.975
I want to be
the perceiver.

91
00:08:19.368 --> 00:08:21.065
Not God.

92
00:08:21.109 --> 00:08:22.502
Right. well...

93
00:08:23.546 --> 00:08:26.767
you see in Berkeley's world.
in his ideology...

94
00:08:27.724 --> 00:08:29.030
God is the receiver...

95
00:08:30.118 --> 00:08:31.380
everything exists.

96
00:08:32.642 --> 00:08:34.209
The rocks in the woods.

97
00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:35.689
the plants
at the bottom of the ocean.

98
00:08:35.732 --> 00:08:37.125
the wind in the desert

99
00:08:37.168 --> 00:08:39.257
because it's being
perceived by God.

100
00:08:40.607 --> 00:08:43.523
So how does that
undo what happened?

101
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.013
You got
a lot of planes here.

102
00:09:00.235 --> 00:09:01.932
Airport's just over there.

103
00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:23.650
You say nothing
can undo what happened.

104
00:09:27.871 --> 00:09:29.743
Time flows forward.

105
00:09:33.268 --> 00:09:35.183
Nothing changes that.

106
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.581
I was contacted
by the FBI.

107
00:09:42.669 --> 00:09:43.974
What are you doing?

108
00:09:45.323 --> 00:09:46.760
What did they want?

109
00:09:50.328 --> 00:09:52.113
You need
to be careful.

110
00:09:53.723 --> 00:09:55.464
Did you tell them
about me?

111
00:09:56.247 --> 00:09:57.771
No. no.

112
00:09:57.814 --> 00:09:59.511
Our conversations
are protected.

113
00:10:01.557 --> 00:10:02.863
For now.

114
00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:11.045
I have to make
this happen.

115
00:10:14.831 --> 00:10:16.616
-Natalie. what happens if you--
-I'll die.

116
00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:23.448
Are you threatening
to take your own life?

117
00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:24.841
No.

118
00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:29.454
But I'm going to die
one way or another. right?

119
00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:34.808
Natalie. I can't help you
if I don't know your plan.

120
00:11:12.584 --> 00:11:13.890
Natalie Derkins?

121
00:11:14.804 --> 00:11:16.414
Are you Natalie Derkins?

122
00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:18.678
-Yeah.
-Special Agent Nuñez.

123
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:20.244
I have some questions
to ask you.

124
00:11:20.288 --> 00:11:21.637
May I come in?

125
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:25.075
♪

126
00:11:39.568 --> 00:11:41.526
-Do you want some water?
-No. thank you.

127
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.531
Do you know why I'm here.
Miss Derkins?

128
00:11:51.798 --> 00:11:53.669
Well. much of your
recent buying activity

129
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.105
is drawing
some attention.

130
00:12:02.809 --> 00:12:04.680
We'll just pretend
like this is enough.

131
00:12:05.376 --> 00:12:07.727
It's not. but. uh.
I'd really like

132
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.902
to see somebody
pull this off.

133
00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.383
How is that
any of your concern. sir?

134
00:12:13.036 --> 00:12:15.125
You see. my department
is sort of a--

135
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.998
We watch
what people buy.

136
00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:19.608
Then we determine
if we need to see

137
00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:20.827
what they're doing
with their purchases.

138
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.393
You know. some a--

139
00:12:22.437 --> 00:12:23.960
some math major
with a minor in poly sci

140
00:12:24.004 --> 00:12:25.657
buys two tons
of fertilizer.

141
00:12:25.701 --> 00:12:27.659
Maybe I need to come see
if he's doing something--

142
00:12:27.703 --> 00:12:29.270
If he's building a bomb?

143
00:12:31.228 --> 00:12:32.708
Doing something
he shouldn't.

144
00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:35.189
But your idea
is interesting.

145
00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:43.458
This is what
I'm trying to build.

146
00:12:45.852 --> 00:12:49.116
Trying to change the past
through perception.

147
00:12:51.205 --> 00:12:53.773
So. how are you connecting
perception to reality?

148
00:12:54.382 --> 00:12:56.210
Perception is reality.

149
00:12:56.253 --> 00:12:58.299
Imagining is not being.

150
00:12:58.342 --> 00:12:59.953
If that were true.
the Cubs would have won

151
00:12:59.996 --> 00:13:01.824
the World Series by now.

152
00:13:01.868 --> 00:13:03.739
How are you connecting
the then to the now?

153
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.742
Sleeping pills.

154
00:13:07.525 --> 00:13:09.179
Sensory cues.

155
00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:10.790
the way that
his jacket felt.

156
00:13:10.833 --> 00:13:12.443
the music
that we listened to...

157
00:13:13.967 --> 00:13:15.229
cigarette smells.

158
00:13:15.272 --> 00:13:17.840
Sure. so some fake VR?

159
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.843
I need it
to be more than that.

160
00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:22.889
I need it
to be real.

161
00:13:22.932 --> 00:13:24.891
I'm not
building a bomb.

162
00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:29.852
If you were clean.
you wouldn't protest so much.

163
00:13:29.896 --> 00:13:32.768
I protested once.

164
00:13:33.638 --> 00:13:34.857
While I'm here.

165
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:38.339
So. I think
you get the point

166
00:13:38.382 --> 00:13:40.036
and I think you know
where I'm going with this.

167
00:13:40.602 --> 00:13:42.822
What is it
that you think I've bought?

168
00:13:43.648 --> 00:13:46.173
It wasn't
two tons of fertilizer.

169
00:13:47.304 --> 00:13:50.438
What could you possibly
think that I have?

170
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:52.919
It's not
what I think you have.

171
00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:56.444
We're not the brightest
over at the FBI.

172
00:13:56.487 --> 00:13:58.315
but I'll tell you
what we don't do.

173
00:13:58.359 --> 00:14:01.057
You don't buy into any crazy
theories or throw hunches.

174
00:14:01.623 --> 00:14:02.929
I know what you have.

175
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:05.801
You've recently managed
to obtain these materials.

176
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:07.107
Miss Derkins.

177
00:14:13.156 --> 00:14:14.984
None of these
are illegal to own.

178
00:14:15.028 --> 00:14:17.030
Maybe not. but rarely do people
buy these combinations

179
00:14:17.073 --> 00:14:18.422
in these
kinds of quantities.

180
00:14:18.466 --> 00:14:20.033
Otherwise.
I wouldn't be here.

181
00:14:20.076 --> 00:14:22.774
On top of that with
your major in engineering

182
00:14:22.818 --> 00:14:24.211

187
00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:12.868
You're talking about
quantum immortality...

188
00:15:14.304 --> 00:15:16.350

a particle can exist

189
00:15:16.393 --> 00:15:19.092

simultaneously.

190
00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:20.702
Two different realities.

191
00:15:21.268 --> 00:15:22.617
You know.
like if you were to die

192

in one of them.
well. then--

193
00:15:24.358 --> 00:15:27.143
You could live

194
00:15:27.187 --> 00:15:29.189
Yeah. um...

195
00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:31.495
your little doodle here
might do it.

196
00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:33.410

00:15:33.454 --> 00:15:35.412
trying to get to Mars
on a steam engine.

198
00:15:35.456 --> 00:15:37.414
You're going to need
some rocket fuel.

199
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.464
And a lot of people
have gotten screwed up.

200
00:15:43.507 --> 00:15:45.248

have died trying to pull

-I don't care.

202
00:15:47.076 --> 00:15:49.122
You're really going to be
juicing your brain.

203
00:15:49.905 --> 00:15:52.386
And Natalie.
if certain people figure out

204
00:15:52.429 --> 00:15:53.865
you're trying
to pull this off

205
00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:55.345
they're going
to want to stop you.

206
00:15:57.869 --> 00:15:58.958
I won't let them.

207
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:12.058

any more questions for me?

00:16:12.101 --> 00:16:13.320
Should I?

209
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:17.759
What if I'm not satisfied
with any of your answers?

210
00:16:18.934 --> 00:16:21.241
Well. then I would
get satisfied.

211
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.985
Miss Derkins. you do realize
that my being here means

212
00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:27.987
you're being investigated
by the FBI.

213
00:16:28.683 --> 00:16:30.163
I'm tired.

214
00:16:30.206 --> 00:16:31.599
I guess I could just
go home then.

215
00:16:31.642 --> 00:16:34.123
Yeah.
I guess you could.

216
00:16:34.167 --> 00:16:35.820
Miss Derkins.
I'm not going anywhere

217
00:16:35.864 --> 00:16:37.561
until you tell me
what I need to know.

218
00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:39.389
What is it
that you need to know?

219
00:16:40.564 --> 00:16:42.871
Why did you
buy these items?

220
00:16:42.914 --> 00:16:45.482
I don't have to explain
anything to you.

221
00:16:46.266 --> 00:16:48.659
Now. unless
it has become illegal

222
00:16:48.703 --> 00:16:50.400
for me to legally
obtain items

223
00:16:50.444 --> 00:16:52.185
that are legal to use
in your household...

224
00:16:53.316 --> 00:16:55.884
then I don't know. yeah. maybe
you can contact my lawyer.

225
00:16:58.104 --> 00:16:59.322
Do you want me
to call him?

226
00:17:04.197 --> 00:17:05.937
Because if not. get out.

227
00:17:12.466 --> 00:17:14.033
I'm sorry to bother you.

228
00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:16.470
Good.

229
00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:20.648
You might want to talk
to that lawyer. though.

230
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:22.737
Let me know.
I'll be back soon.

231
00:17:25.435 --> 00:17:28.134
Also. you should know
that it's a federal offense

232
00:17:28.177 --> 00:17:29.744
to threaten an agent
with a loaded weapon.

233
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.749
Good day. Miss Derkins.

234
00:17:58.903 --> 00:18:01.602
So you think
you can change the past by--

235
00:18:01.645 --> 00:18:03.256
Remembering it differently.

236
00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:05.475
If I can
convince myself.

237
00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:07.825
I mean.
really convince myself then...

238
00:18:09.044 --> 00:18:10.741
maybe it'll be real.

239
00:18:10.785 --> 00:18:13.092
-If you perceive it to be.
-Yeah.

240
00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:15.355
Natalie. you know.
it'll never be real.

241
00:18:15.398 --> 00:18:17.922
The second you come back
from new memories.

242
00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:19.272
it'll be smoke.

00:18:20.229 --> 00:18:21.535

But if I can
just force it...

246

convince myself.

00:18:37.246 --> 00:18:39.118

are you thinking?

366
00:31:45.642 --> 00:31:47.122
Well.
I could explain it to you

367
00:31:47.166 --> 00:31:50.082
as an overly intellectual
thought process

368
00:31:50.125 --> 00:31:52.649
that concerns time
and how it relates to death.

369
00:31:55.522 --> 00:31:57.176

370

-Well. I'm here

-No.

374

No. you're here
because you're worried.

375
00:32:16.021 --> 00:32:18.327
Yes. Natalie.
I'm worried.

376
00:32:24.072 --> 00:32:25.944
Time's not a fluid.

377
00:32:26.814 --> 00:32:28.947

not the way that people

378
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.339

379
00:32:30.383 --> 00:32:31.514
I mean. time is--

380
00:32:33.908 --> 00:32:35.954
Fluids aren't even fluids.

381
00:32:37.303 --> 00:32:38.957

382
00:32:40.262 --> 00:32:42.438

383
00:32:43.787 --> 00:32:45.006

-For what

-Yes.
