3
00:01:17.252 --> 00:01:21.155
The 308 is a big game
hunting cartridge.

4
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.388
Shooting at a moving
target will be

5
00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:26.391
more difficult than hitting
a stationary target.

6
00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:34.531
Winds are coming in
from the Northwest.

7
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:37.864
In a 10-mile an
hour wind. that 308

8
00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.142
will drift roughly 100
inches at that range.

9
00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:56.784
Control your breathing.
slow it down. and hold.

10
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.499
Now. pull the trigger.

11
00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:18.839
Fifteen inches low
and to the right.

12
00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:34.327
I'm proud of you. TJ.

13
00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:56.844
Don't let him suffer. son.

14
00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.549
You have to put him
out of his misery.

15
00:04:51.532 --> 00:04:52.399
Beautiful. isn't it?

16
00:04:55.635 --> 00:04:57.129
It's peaceful.

17
00:04:57.164 --> 00:05:00.374
So is our town. Mr. Harper.

18
00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.508
Like I said on the
phone. we may be small.

19
00:05:02.543 --> 00:05:05.478
but we're open for business.

20
00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:08.382
My company has active projects
all across the Midwest.

21
00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:11.847
in Kansas to North Dakota.

22
00:05:11.882 --> 00:05:14.080
We just completed the Bel
Air waterfront development

23
00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:17.523
project in Duluth.

24
00:05:17.558 --> 00:05:21.593
I've talked to the right
people at the state level.

25
00:05:21.628 --> 00:05:23.023
Good.

26
00:05:23.058 --> 00:05:24.959
What troubles me. Mr.
Harper. is the fact

27
00:05:24.994 --> 00:05:27.731
that this great country of
ours elected a president that's

28
00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:30.635
letting the world flood our
market with foreign buyers.

29
00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:39.039
With all due respect.
we're an American company.

30
00:05:39.074 --> 00:05:40.876
We've got over a dozen
development projects

31
00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:42.713
underway right now.

32
00:05:42.748 --> 00:05:45.485
And we pride ourselves in
sustainable infrastructure.

33
00:05:48.853 --> 00:05:51.524
It's the American way.

34
00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.021
My office will forward you
the zoning applications

35
00:05:54.056 --> 00:05:55.858
by Wednesday of next week.

36
00:05:55.893 --> 00:05:59.499
In the meantime. I'll make
sure the right people get paid

37
00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:01.028
and the wrong ones
get out of your way.

38
00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:08.937
And the planning committee?

39
00:06:08.972 --> 00:06:10.741
Councilors?

40
00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:14.107
Council is already on our side.
same goes for the deputy mayor.

41
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:21.488
Economy is in the ship.

42
00:06:21.523 --> 00:06:23.688
That's the good news.

43
00:06:23.723 --> 00:06:25.184
The bad news is that
it's an election.

44
00:06:36.868 --> 00:06:40.540
It's not me you have to
win over. Mr. Harper.

45
00:06:40.575 --> 00:06:42.168
It's the people of
Crawford County.

46
00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:51.584
It's the American way.

47
00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:54.048
Now. this area of farmland
here is a small parcel

48
00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:57.590
of land to the far side
of Big Timber Creek.

49
00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:02.023
As I mentioned. this
proposed development project

50
00:07:02.058 --> 00:07:05.631
is one of the
largest of its kind.

51
00:07:05.666 --> 00:07:07.996
It represents a total
investment in your community

52
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:09.932
of over $150 million.

53
00:07:09.967 --> 00:07:15.707
So in closing. I'd like to add
that my company's number one

54
00:07:15.742 --> 00:07:19.139
priority is the environment.

55
00:07:22.617 --> 00:07:24.650
This will be the
lasting legacy that we

56
00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:30.282
will leave for those who call
Crawford County their home.

57
00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:35.793
We project phase three to be
completed at the end of 1999.

58
00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:38.664
just under a year from now.

59
00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:43.163
And when we do. we will have
created hundreds of new jobs

60
00:07:43.198 --> 00:07:44.835
right here in this community.

61
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:45.935
Yeah. for who?

62
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.266
Your own company?

63
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.939
We don't want to lose
any more of our farms.

64
00:07:49.974 --> 00:07:51.578
This town has a lot
of land that can

65
00:07:51.613 --> 00:07:53.976
be used far more efficiently.

66
00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:55.945
And I want to say to
you that in no way

67
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.882
will we compromise the
environment in doing so.

68
00:08:01.887 --> 00:08:03.821
This town has a lot
of land that can

69
00:08:03.856 --> 00:08:05.592
be used far more efficiently.

70
00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:07.627
You should be ashamed of
yourselves for listening

71
00:08:07.662 --> 00:08:08.628
.

72
00:08:31.818 --> 00:08:33.785
Transform your getaway
to a health and wellness

73
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.282
retreat at our lakeside spa.

74
00:08:36.317 --> 00:08:39.219
Where are my sunglasses?

75
00:08:39.254 --> 00:08:42.189
We were supposed to be
in Eagle Bay an hour ago.

76
00:08:42.224 --> 00:08:44.092
So we're already late.

77
00:08:44.127 --> 00:08:45.225
What's a few more minutes?

78
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.898
How did it go?

79
00:08:47.933 --> 00:08:49.999
Like I figured.

80
00:08:50.034 --> 00:08:52.870
At least the
mayor's on our side.

81
00:08:52.905 --> 00:08:55.807
But I tell you. this
small hick town. they're

82
00:08:55.842 --> 00:08:57.974
looking at a gift horse in
the mouth. if you ask me.

83
00:09:03.047 --> 00:09:03.881
What's this?

84
00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:04.684
What's it look like?

85
00:09:07.854 --> 00:09:09.623
It looks like a gift.

86
00:09:09.658 --> 00:09:10.184
Well. open it.

87
00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:15.629
It's a compass.

88
00:09:15.664 --> 00:09:17.697
Something to help you find
your way out there in the world

89
00:09:17.732 --> 00:09:19.732
and to find your way back to me.

90
00:09:25.773 --> 00:09:27.905
How did I ever get
mixed up with you?

91
00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.203
Your wife introduced us.

92
00:09:29.238 --> 00:09:29.841
Remember?

93
00:09:46.222 --> 00:09:47.793
Are you trying to kill us?

94
00:09:47.828 --> 00:09:51.830
It's a brand new Trans
Am. 325 ponies. 5.7 liters

95
00:09:51.865 --> 00:09:53.260
of American muscle.

96
00:09:53.295 --> 00:09:57.770
Heading in the wrong
direction of a one-way street.

97
00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:01.972
I can't wait to get away
with you to see that.

98
00:10:02.007 --> 00:10:03.303
Yeah.

99
00:10:03.338 --> 00:10:05.910
I'm looking forward to
a couple of days alone.

100
00:10:05.945 --> 00:10:09.375
No work. no
bureaucrats. no phones.

101
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.410
And no wife.

102
00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:13.819
Don't start with that. Brooke.

103
00:10:13.854 --> 00:10:15.854
I thought we moved past this?

104
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:17.691
You did.

105
00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:21.024
You're really good
at getting past it.

106
00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:29.395
Yeah.

107
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:30.099
Yeah.

108
00:10:30.134 --> 00:10:31.034
Buckle up.

109
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:39.075
Spinning around town
in his automobile.

110
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.045
He decide something
for something to steal.

111
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.784
You better buckle up.

112
00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:46.181
You better buckle up.

113
00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:51.791
Tell the union they
can kiss my ass.

114
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.357
Why don't you get the gas?

115
00:10:57.392 --> 00:10:58.490
Yeah.

116
00:11:00.362 --> 00:11:01.196
No.

117
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:02.032
No.

118
00:11:03.398 --> 00:11:05.904
I don't care what the
report says.

119
00:11:05.939 --> 00:11:07.400
We've got 20 dump
trucks full of slate.

120
00:11:07.435 --> 00:11:10.106
and they're all backed up.

121
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:11.811
Yeah.

122
00:11:11.846 --> 00:11:14.110
Well. you tell Grier I want
a face-to-face by Friday.

123
00:11:26.993 --> 00:11:29.323
That's right.

124
00:11:39.137 --> 00:11:41.808
I'm a hard man. more
angles than curves.

125
00:11:41.843 --> 00:11:45.075
You mess with me. you
get what you deserve.

126
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.143
Mister. don't cross that line.

127
00:11:50.885 --> 00:11:54.150
With blue jays and
backwood roots.

128
00:11:54.185 --> 00:11:55.514
You don't want to get with me.

129
00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:01.223
I'll be back in the
office on Monday.

130
00:12:01.258 --> 00:12:02.191
I'll deal with Foster.

131
00:12:17.142 --> 00:12:18.405
Good morning. Sheriff.

132
00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.880
Good morning. Russ.

133
00:12:20.915 --> 00:12:23.850
Going fishing today?

134
00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:25.412
If you catch something.

135
00:12:44.565 --> 00:12:46.202
Everything OK?

136
00:12:46.237 --> 00:12:47.973
Fine.

137
00:12:48.008 --> 00:12:51.504
What happened to all that talk
about no phone. no business?

138
00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:53.011
No. I said. no bureaucrats.

139
00:13:02.352 --> 00:13:06.354
That's what I say
until the day I die.

140
00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.131
If we're heading
North to Eagle Bay.

141
00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:48.968
shouldn't we've just
stayed on the highway?

142
00:13:49.003 --> 00:13:51.168
Come on and miss all those
beautiful countryside?

143
00:13:51.203 --> 00:13:52.466
Yeah. but that
should be us here.

144
00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:54.204
Why didn't we just
stayed on the highway?

145
00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:55.942
The interstate will
be a parking lot.

146
00:13:55.977 --> 00:13:57.108
This will be faster.

147
00:14:15.128 --> 00:14:16.963
Those assholes from
the gas station.

148
00:14:32.277 --> 00:14:33.914
Good. a cop.

149
00:15:06.674 --> 00:15:08.245
New York plates.

150
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.347
You two lost?

151
00:15:11.382 --> 00:15:13.316
You didn't see that?

152
00:15:13.351 --> 00:15:15.615
See what?

153
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.089
The pickup truck.

154
00:15:17.124 --> 00:15:18.057
They nearly killed us.

155
00:15:18.092 --> 00:15:19.322
They run us off the road.

156
00:15:19.357 --> 00:15:21.258
I guess you didn't see me.

157
00:15:21.293 --> 00:15:23.326
You shot past me up on 48.

158
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:24.591
Yeah.

159
00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:25.724
Well. I haven't seen
a posted speed limit

160
00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:26.758
in the last few
miles around here.

161
00:15:26.793 --> 00:15:28.232
Can I see your driver's license?

162
00:15:46.153 --> 00:15:47.020
Get out of the car.

163
00:15:50.652 --> 00:15:54.126
What's this about?

164
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:55.721
I don't know what
you do in New York.

165
00:15:55.756 --> 00:15:57.591
But out here. when
the Sheriff asked

166
00:15:57.626 --> 00:16:00.165
you to get out of the car. you
get the fuck out of the car.

167
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.761
Get out.

168
00:16:05.238 --> 00:16:06.138
You too. princess.

169
00:16:06.173 --> 00:16:07.106
Let's go.

170
00:16:11.739 --> 00:16:13.376
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

171
00:16:16.447 --> 00:16:17.446
Stay over there.

172
00:16:17.481 --> 00:16:18.381
I'm going to search your car.

173
00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:37.103
What are we going to do?

174
00:16:42.506 --> 00:16:43.637
Well. lookie what we have here?

175
00:16:43.672 --> 00:16:44.572
A concealed weapon.

176
00:16:47.445 --> 00:16:49.676
What are you carrying this for?

177
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:52.118
Protection.

178
00:16:52.153 --> 00:16:53.218
Protection from what?

179
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.189
Paperworks are in the glove box.

180
00:16:57.224 --> 00:16:59.422
It's completely legal.

181
00:16:59.457 --> 00:17:01.061
Not in my County. it's not.

182
00:17:06.497 --> 00:17:07.529
There. that's the truck.

183
00:17:55.315 --> 00:17:56.314
Jesus Christ.

184
00:17:56.349 --> 00:17:57.546
Is this town all crazy?

185
00:17:57.581 --> 00:17:58.679
Calm down.

186
00:17:58.714 --> 00:17:59.713
Calm down?

187
00:17:59.748 --> 00:18:01.154
These rednecks nearly killed us.

188
00:18:01.189 --> 00:18:02.188
You want me to calm down?

189
00:18:29.646 --> 00:18:30.744
This is crazy.

190
00:18:30.779 --> 00:18:33.318
I want to speak
to your superiors.

191
00:18:33.353 --> 00:18:34.649
Open your mouth
one more time. I'm

192
00:18:34.684 --> 00:18:36.288
going to shoot you in the head.

193
00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.557
We look like criminals to you?

194
00:18:41.592 --> 00:18:43.955
I don't know what
criminals look like.

195
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.298
How about you fellas?

196
00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:47.464
They look lost to me.

197
00:18:51.866 --> 00:18:54.801
What the hell is going on here?

198
00:18:55.804 --> 00:18:58.442
Raymond Harper. New York.

199
00:18:58.477 --> 00:18:59.938
What do you do for
a living. big shot?

200
00:19:02.811 --> 00:19:05.845
Construction.

201
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.485
What do you build?

202
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.684
We haven't done anything.

203
00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:20.992
Rick. take the Trans Am and
park it up back at the Marina.

204
00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:21.927
We'll meet you there.

205
00:19:44.688 --> 00:19:46.886
Thanks for the short notice.

206
00:19:46.921 --> 00:19:49.922
I wasn't expecting
you until later.

207
00:19:49.957 --> 00:19:51.693
Just make sure
she's all gassed up.

208
00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:02.935
Hey.

209
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.476
Is this even legal?

210
00:20:35.805 --> 00:20:36.969
It's a short walk to the boat.

211
00:20:55.363 --> 00:20:56.362
Holy fuck.

212
00:20:56.397 --> 00:20:58.463
You still got this old tin can?

213
00:20:58.498 --> 00:21:01.433
It maybe old. but
she's still mine.

214
00:21:01.468 --> 00:21:03.798
Does this thing even
going to get us out there?

215
00:21:03.833 --> 00:21:04.832
She'll get us there.

216
00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:05.668
All right.

217
00:21:05.703 --> 00:21:06.735
You two. let's go.

218
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.373
Move it.

219
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:13.104
Oh. hot blooded.

220
00:21:13.139 --> 00:21:14.413
Just how I like them.

221
00:21:43.675 --> 00:21:44.740
You're feeling all right?

222
00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:49.745
That's how she's
supposed to feel.

223
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.878
She doesn't like the water.

224
00:22:04.564 --> 00:22:06.025
Why are we heading East?

225
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.159
The island's North.

226
00:22:08.194 --> 00:22:09.567
The lake's choppy.

227
00:22:09.602 --> 00:22:10.832
We're going around it.

228
00:22:19.711 --> 00:22:21.414
You don't have the
same last name.

229
00:22:23.913 --> 00:22:25.847
What?

230
00:22:25.882 --> 00:22:29.422
You don't have the
same last name as her.

231
00:22:30.854 --> 00:22:35.593
Oh. your wife doesn't know.

232
00:22:35.628 --> 00:22:38.530
You've been a bad boy. Raymond.

233
00:23:26.008 --> 00:23:27.678
Let's go.

234
00:23:27.713 --> 00:23:29.746
Move. let's go.

235
00:23:44.092 --> 00:23:46.026
You can keep whatever
is in the bag.

236
00:23:50.538 --> 00:23:54.067
Take Gary's patrol car
around back. get it inside.

237
00:23:54.102 --> 00:23:57.939
Same goes for my truck.

238
00:23:57.974 --> 00:24:01.514
Trans Am. take it to Chuck's
directly. get rid of it.

239
00:24:01.549 --> 00:24:03.945
You can keep anything
that's inside.

240
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.518
All right.

241
00:24:05.553 --> 00:24:06.112
Got it?

242
00:24:06.147 --> 00:24:06.816
Yeah.

243
00:24:06.851 --> 00:24:09.016
I got it.

244
00:24:25.705 --> 00:24:27.507
I've been coming here
since I was a kid.

245
00:24:30.974 --> 00:24:33.810
My dad built this place
with his own hands.

246
00:24:36.276 --> 00:24:38.749
Just like owning your
own slice of heaven.

247
00:24:41.589 --> 00:24:42.852
You can't beat it.

248
00:25:07.714 --> 00:25:10.946
What's this?

249
00:25:10.981 --> 00:25:13.982
An extremely expensive watch.

250
00:25:14.017 --> 00:25:15.720
Come on. let us go.

251
00:25:15.755 --> 00:25:19.251
And the watch. the car. I'd
say it's a pretty good deal.

252
00:25:22.157 --> 00:25:23.992
Let you go. just like that?

253
00:25:28.834 --> 00:25:32.704
It doesn't even have
any numbers on it.

254
00:25:32.739 --> 00:25:34.068
How am I supposed
to tell the time?

255
00:25:37.843 --> 00:25:40.877
I think I'll keep my own.

256
00:25:40.912 --> 00:25:46.311
It was a gift from my wife.

257
00:25:46.346 --> 00:25:49.083
I can get you 50.000
by tomorrow night.

258
00:25:49.118 --> 00:25:50.788
Wow.

259
00:25:50.823 --> 00:25:53.219
That's an awful lot of money
for a construction worker.

260
00:25:53.254 --> 00:25:55.661
I'm a land developer.

261
00:25:55.696 --> 00:25:58.631
And is that what this is about?

262
00:25:58.666 --> 00:26:00.699
Kidnapping?

263
00:26:00.734 --> 00:26:02.360
What will it take?

264
00:26:02.395 --> 00:26:04.604
100.000?

265
00:26:23.416 --> 00:26:25.053
Are you going to tell
us what you want?

266
00:26:25.088 --> 00:26:26.153
Just keep your mouth shut.

267
00:26:27.827 --> 00:26:29.288
You. sit down.

268
00:26:53.017 --> 00:26:55.083
You will behave yourselves.

269
00:26:55.118 --> 00:26:59.725
If you don't. we're not
going to be nice anymore.

270
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.925
And we're going to
hurt you real bad.

271
00:27:18.878 --> 00:27:21.274
Sit your ass back
down in that chair.

272
00:27:35.158 --> 00:27:36.894
That's some woman you
got there. Raymond.

273
00:27:37.391 --> 00:27:38.764
Strong.

274
00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:42.295
Nearly put it through the table.

275
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:45.804
You better not hurt her.

276
00:27:45.839 --> 00:27:46.431
Or what?

277
00:27:50.272 --> 00:27:52.107
What are you going to do next?

278
00:27:52.142 --> 00:27:53.009
Rape me?

279
00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:59.477
We're hunters not animals.

280
00:27:59.512 --> 00:28:01.512
And married. sweetheart.

281
00:28:01.547 --> 00:28:04.185
Not that that means
anything to you.

282
00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.220
There is no escape.

283
00:28:06.255 --> 00:28:07.892
You'll know why
you're here tomorrow.

284
00:28:24.075 --> 00:28:24.777
Cuff yourself.

285
00:28:32.017 --> 00:28:34.512
Stop sandbagging it. honey.

286
00:28:34.547 --> 00:28:38.186
Hurry up.

287
00:29:18.393 --> 00:29:20.833
How's the arm?

288
00:29:20.868 --> 00:29:22.164
How do you think?

289
00:29:22.199 --> 00:29:24.331
She put a fucking
knife through it.

290
00:29:24.366 --> 00:29:25.497
Could have been worse.

291
00:29:35.982 --> 00:29:37.278
I'm in.

292
00:29:37.313 --> 00:29:39.577
You guys hear about the
mine in Jackson closing?

293
00:29:44.485 --> 00:29:49.290
Chappie. he was a foreman
up there. wasn't he?

294
00:29:49.325 --> 00:29:50.456
That's right.

295
00:29:50.491 --> 00:29:52.590
Gone.

296
00:29:52.625 --> 00:29:54.966
They retired him.

297
00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:55.967
That's two to you. TJ.

298
00:30:00.072 --> 00:30:02.567
I'm in.

299
00:30:02.602 --> 00:30:05.108
That's not what happened.

300
00:30:05.143 --> 00:30:06.637
What'd you hear?

301
00:30:06.672 --> 00:30:07.913
It's not what I heard.

302
00:30:07.948 --> 00:30:11.015
It's what I know.

303
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.018
He spent his whole
life down in that mine.

304
00:30:14.053 --> 00:30:17.615
You guys should know better than
anyone. under ground for that

305
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.253
long.

306
00:30:22.622 --> 00:30:24.556
Is this something
to do with your job?

307
00:30:24.591 --> 00:30:26.932
Development projects
up in this area?

308
00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:29.363
It has to be.

309
00:30:29.398 --> 00:30:30.661
I've made enemies
over the years.

310
00:30:30.696 --> 00:30:32.069
but not that want to kill me.

311
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.942
Why do you carry a gun?

312
00:30:36.977 --> 00:30:38.108
I don't carry it.

313
00:30:38.143 --> 00:30:41.177
I keep it in the
car for protection.

314
00:30:41.212 --> 00:30:42.475
It's a last resort.

315
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.213
I'd say this is a last resort.

316
00:30:44.248 --> 00:30:46.479
Why didn't you use it earlier?

317
00:30:46.514 --> 00:30:47.183
On a cop?

318
00:30:56.656 --> 00:31:01.527
And what the hell is a uniformed
cop doing involved in this?

319
00:31:01.562 --> 00:31:02.968
They want money.

320
00:31:03.003 --> 00:31:05.069
Just give it to them.

321
00:31:05.104 --> 00:31:06.598
I handed him a gold watch.

322
00:31:06.633 --> 00:31:08.270
He threw it away
like it was nothing.

323
00:31:11.407 --> 00:31:13.110
No.

324
00:31:13.145 --> 00:31:15.145
If this is about money.
they would have said so.

325
00:31:20.119 --> 00:31:21.646
Ransom.

326
00:31:21.681 --> 00:31:25.452
Maybe they're going to ransom
you like a kidnapping plot.

327
00:31:25.487 --> 00:31:26.519
Who would bring us here?

328
00:31:26.554 --> 00:31:27.993
This place-- look at this place.

329
00:31:28.028 --> 00:31:30.259
It's got no power.
no phone. nothing.

330
00:31:33.726 --> 00:31:34.428
I'm scared.

331
00:31:37.268 --> 00:31:38.432
I am so scared.

332
00:31:52.679 --> 00:31:55.350
Two.

333
00:31:55.385 --> 00:31:58.419
Housing costs are going up.

334
00:31:58.454 --> 00:32:01.994
All the city folk
are moving this way.

335
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:03.655
I check.

336
00:32:05.098 --> 00:32:06.691
It's no sweat off
your balls. Gary.

337
00:32:06.726 --> 00:32:09.331
You landed yourself
a government job.

338
00:32:09.366 --> 00:32:13.269
I left Detroit for a reason.
not to work my ass off swimming

339
00:32:13.304 --> 00:32:15.700
in all that human garbage.

340
00:32:15.735 --> 00:32:17.075
It's a fucking war zone.

341
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:19.011
It always has been.

342
00:32:19.046 --> 00:32:20.408
Back when I was at
the 5th precinct.

343
00:32:20.443 --> 00:32:21.508
there was a murder a night.

344
00:32:30.585 --> 00:32:34.686
Sometimes I just pray for it.

345
00:32:34.721 --> 00:32:35.654
Raise three.

346
00:32:37.295 --> 00:32:39.229
Pray for what?

347
00:32:39.264 --> 00:32:42.199
Society to fall apart.

348
00:32:42.234 --> 00:32:45.367
I mean. really fall apart.

349
00:32:45.402 --> 00:32:47.402
No cops. no law.

350
00:32:50.737 --> 00:32:53.177
Maybe we need a reset.

351
00:32:53.212 --> 00:32:54.739
Personally. I
thought the Russkies

352
00:32:54.774 --> 00:32:57.511
would have invaded by now.

353
00:32:57.546 --> 00:33:00.052
What do you think. Gary?

354
00:33:00.087 --> 00:33:01.416
About what?

355
00:33:01.451 --> 00:33:03.550
Moving further North.

356
00:33:03.585 --> 00:33:05.783
You got rocks in your head?

357
00:33:05.818 --> 00:33:08.390
Any further North
would be in the lake.

358
00:33:08.425 --> 00:33:09.358
I ain't going anywhere.

359
00:33:09.393 --> 00:33:10.260
I'll die here.

360
00:33:16.598 --> 00:33:19.665
Up to 10 bucks to you. Rick.

361
00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.436
Interesting.

362
00:33:21.471 --> 00:33:22.404
I raise 30 bucks.

363
00:33:24.837 --> 00:33:26.672
If I catch you cheating
one more time. Rick.

364
00:33:26.707 --> 00:33:28.773
I'm going to shove this
deck up your fucking ass.

365
00:33:37.487 --> 00:33:39.718
We're drifting
North of the Marina.

366
00:33:39.753 --> 00:33:41.060
I'd say two or three miles.

367
00:33:43.427 --> 00:33:44.327
How do you know that?

368
00:33:49.169 --> 00:33:51.664
Average speed of a boat is
about 30 minutes per mile.

369
00:33:51.699 --> 00:33:53.732
maybe more.

370
00:33:57.342 --> 00:33:58.836
We took just over an hour
and a half to get here.

371
00:33:58.871 --> 00:34:00.145
So--

372
00:34:01.874 --> 00:34:03.478
How are we going
to get out of here?

373
00:34:06.912 --> 00:34:08.549
We do what they say.

374
00:34:08.584 --> 00:34:10.749
That seems to be working
real good so far.

375
00:34:10.784 --> 00:34:13.719
If we don't think of
something. we're in trouble.

376
00:34:13.754 --> 00:34:17.195
What do you want us to do?

377
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.792
Our car is probably sitting at
the bottom of the lake by now.

378
00:34:20.827 --> 00:34:22.860
They have all the guns.

379
00:34:22.895 --> 00:34:24.697
We don't know where we are.

380
00:34:24.732 --> 00:34:28.338
There's no radio or
telephone that we know of.

381
00:34:28.373 --> 00:34:29.273
One of them is a cop.

382
00:34:34.412 --> 00:34:35.411
And then there's you.

383
00:34:38.383 --> 00:34:39.580
What about me?

384
00:34:42.222 --> 00:34:43.320
Everyone knows you're here.

385
00:34:59.338 --> 00:35:01.173
What are you doing?

386
00:35:01.208 --> 00:35:01.602
Hey.

387
00:35:01.637 --> 00:35:02.372
Get up.

388
00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:04.242
Hey.

389
00:35:04.673 --> 00:35:05.540
Ray.

390
00:35:37.673 --> 00:35:40.311
Please. we haven't
done anything.

391
00:35:42.348 --> 00:35:44.975
Does this have something
to do with Ray's work?

392
00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:46.383
My family has no money.

393
00:35:50.785 --> 00:35:51.949
I don't deserve to be here.

394
00:35:55.922 --> 00:36:00.958
If you're going to tell
me your whole life story.

395
00:36:00.993 --> 00:36:02.663
why don't you sit down.

396
00:36:11.905 --> 00:36:12.574
I insist.

397
00:36:28.526 --> 00:36:29.393
Why are we here?

398
00:36:33.025 --> 00:36:34.695
What the hell is going on here?

399
00:36:37.502 --> 00:36:38.369
I want to leave.

400
00:36:59.425 --> 00:37:02.624
You're free to go.

401
00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:03.658
That's not what I meant.

402
00:37:08.335 --> 00:37:09.565
Call Ray's wife.

403
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.269
She'll pay.

404
00:37:13.967 --> 00:37:16.539
Not when she finds out you've
been banging her old man.

405
00:38:23.102 --> 00:38:24.904
How about a dance. sweetheart?

406
00:38:30.813 --> 00:38:33.814
She don't like you. Gary.

407
00:38:33.849 --> 00:38:38.588
Maybe she's too good
for your country ass.

408
00:38:38.623 --> 00:38:39.985
Why don't you like me?

409
00:38:47.159 --> 00:38:50.028
Oh. you smell so nice.

410
00:39:24.504 --> 00:39:26.438
What the hell you're
doing with that little gun

411
00:39:26.473 --> 00:39:27.472
up here for anyway?

412
00:39:30.235 --> 00:39:33.676
Pulled it out lock up
about two years ago.

413
00:39:33.711 --> 00:39:38.483
Some gangbanger got lit up on
52nd street in the West Side.

414
00:39:38.518 --> 00:39:40.617
I read the report too.

415
00:39:40.652 --> 00:39:44.588
Witnesses say it looks like
he was dancing the jig.

416
00:39:46.185 --> 00:39:48.922
Today's the day that I get to
watch someone dance exactly

417
00:39:48.957 --> 00:39:51.760
like that little greaseball did.

418
00:40:16.754 --> 00:40:20.756
You finally going to tell us
what you plan on doing with us?

419
00:40:20.791 --> 00:40:22.758
What's it look like?

420
00:40:22.793 --> 00:40:23.825
They're going to hunt us.

421
00:40:27.127 --> 00:40:27.730
What?

422
00:40:31.131 --> 00:40:32.834
You expect us to
just walk out of here

423
00:40:32.869 --> 00:40:35.969
so you can hunt us down?

424
00:40:36.004 --> 00:40:37.872
No gun.

425
00:40:37.907 --> 00:40:40.204
If you keep your wits about
you. and you might make it out

426
00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:42.107
alive.

427
00:40:42.142 --> 00:40:45.781
And you never know. you
might wind up killing us.

428
00:40:45.816 --> 00:40:46.485
With what?

429
00:40:57.124 --> 00:41:01.698
Rick. Gary. and I used to go
hunting up near Buck's Bay.

430
00:41:01.733 --> 00:41:03.799
We went for years.

431
00:41:03.834 --> 00:41:07.737
A hundred white tails.
wild boar. but the outcome

432
00:41:07.772 --> 00:41:09.673
was always the same.

433
00:41:09.708 --> 00:41:14.579
Like my father always said.
once you've hunted men.

434
00:41:14.614 --> 00:41:19.309
animals just don't
cut it anymore.

435
00:41:19.344 --> 00:41:21.619
You're going to feel
a rush of adrenaline

436
00:41:21.654 --> 00:41:24.853
like you've never
experienced before.

437
00:41:24.888 --> 00:41:30.958
All your natural instincts to
survive are going to take over.

438
00:41:30.993 --> 00:41:34.731
You're going to feel more
alive in the next few hours

439
00:41:34.766 --> 00:41:39.065
and then all those wasted years.

440
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:44.642
This island is three miles
from shore to shore surrounded

441
00:41:44.677 --> 00:41:47.337
by water in all directions.

442
00:41:47.372 --> 00:41:50.241
There's no way off this rock.

443
00:41:50.276 --> 00:41:54.179
Even we can't leave not until
morning when the boat arrives.

444
00:41:54.214 --> 00:41:56.588
Please. don't do this.

445
00:41:56.623 --> 00:41:57.589
Start running.

446
00:42:23.243 --> 00:42:28.180
I can't go.

447
00:42:32.758 --> 00:42:33.284
We have to move.

448
00:42:33.319 --> 00:42:34.153
We can't stop.

449
00:42:34.188 --> 00:42:37.255
If we stop. we die.

450
00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:39.059
What do you figure?

451
00:42:39.094 --> 00:42:40.962
Four hours tops.

452
00:42:43.428 --> 00:42:45.901
Remember that
couple from Florida?

453
00:42:45.936 --> 00:42:50.037
That was a complete wash out
My balls barely broke a sweat.

454
00:42:50.072 --> 00:42:52.270
Yeah. TJ got the first kill.

455
00:42:52.305 --> 00:42:53.942
He got lucky.

456
00:42:53.977 --> 00:42:55.680
The wife was the
size of a truck.

457
00:42:55.715 --> 00:42:57.946
You and I flushed
it right toward him.

458
00:42:57.981 --> 00:42:59.816
You're getting old. Rick.

459
00:42:59.851 --> 00:43:03.182
You couldn't catch her
today if you tried.

460
00:43:18.903 --> 00:43:21.167
Squeeze in a little bit.

461
00:43:21.202 --> 00:43:23.070
Why?

462
00:43:23.105 --> 00:43:24.137
For Luann and the kids.

463
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:40.956
Are you OK?

464
00:43:40.991 --> 00:43:42.419
I'm not OK.

465
00:43:42.454 --> 00:43:44.190
None of this is OK.

466
00:43:48.262 --> 00:43:49.230
Why us?

467
00:43:53.102 --> 00:43:54.167
Why us?

468
00:43:58.338 --> 00:44:00.272
It doesn't matter now.

469
00:44:00.307 --> 00:44:02.208
If we just do this. we'll
figure it out later.

470
00:44:02.243 --> 00:44:03.847
Yes.

471
00:44:03.882 --> 00:44:05.013
Come on.

472
00:44:05.048 --> 00:44:05.475
Let's go.

473
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:06.278
Up.

474
00:44:06.313 --> 00:44:07.312
Let's go.

475
00:44:07.347 --> 00:44:08.753
Up. up.

476
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:32.777
What do you figure?

477
00:44:32.812 --> 00:44:34.504
I don't.

478
00:44:34.539 --> 00:44:36.979
They're going to go straight
in until they hit the water

479
00:44:37.014 --> 00:44:40.246
and double back
the way they came.

480
00:44:40.281 --> 00:44:42.512
I don't think so.

481
00:44:42.547 --> 00:44:45.988
I bet they run straight up
the blind side of the lake.

482
00:44:46.023 --> 00:44:48.859
Follow it right around.

483
00:44:48.894 --> 00:44:49.827
Not a chance.

484
00:44:49.862 --> 00:44:52.357
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

485
00:44:52.392 --> 00:44:54.898
I'll take that bet.

486
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:05.304
Over there.

487
00:45:10.916 --> 00:45:11.541
Where?

488
00:45:11.576 --> 00:45:13.213
Over there.

489
00:45:13.248 --> 00:45:15.149
Are you sure?

490
00:45:15.184 --> 00:45:16.249
I don't see anything.

491
00:45:23.093 --> 00:45:25.225
Never mind.

492
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.259
OK.

493
00:45:26.294 --> 00:45:30.032
Split up no more than 100 yards.

494
00:45:30.067 --> 00:45:32.529
If you see something. fire
a single shot in the air.

495
00:45:32.564 --> 00:45:35.004
The other two will come running.

496
00:45:35.039 --> 00:45:36.566
Sounds good to me.

497
00:45:36.601 --> 00:45:37.875
What do you say. Rick?

498
00:45:41.474 --> 00:45:44.277
I'm OK with that.

499
00:46:30.292 --> 00:46:33.425
We've got to get
back to the cabin.

500
00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.966
There's going to be a
gun. a knife. anything.

501
00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:36.967
No.

502
00:46:37.002 --> 00:46:38.331
They won't be expecting it.

503
00:46:38.366 --> 00:46:39.233
No.

504
00:46:39.268 --> 00:46:39.871
Please.

505
00:46:59.123 --> 00:47:00.287
I hear them.

506
00:47:03.061 --> 00:47:03.455
Hide.

507
00:47:38.591 --> 00:47:40.492
They're coming.

508
00:47:40.527 --> 00:47:42.428
Listen to me.

509
00:47:42.463 --> 00:47:45.101
You've got to get out of here.

510
00:47:45.136 --> 00:47:49.072
Run and hide as fast as you can.

511
00:47:49.107 --> 00:47:50.238
Please. go.

512
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.066
Gary.

513
00:50:14.681 --> 00:50:16.582
They got my fucking gun.

514
00:50:16.617 --> 00:50:18.782
Oh. well that's just great.

515
00:50:18.817 --> 00:50:21.092
What do you think of
the odds now. Gary?

516
00:50:21.127 --> 00:50:22.489
Fuck you. Rick.

517
00:50:22.524 --> 00:50:23.424
Now. they're armed.

518
00:50:26.165 --> 00:50:28.396
It doesn't change a thing.

519
00:50:28.431 --> 00:50:29.826
There's the three of us.

520
00:50:29.861 --> 00:50:31.696
We know the terrain.

521
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:38.406
Besides. if it was too easy.
where would the fun be?

522
00:50:38.441 --> 00:50:40.606
They got you good.

523
00:50:40.641 --> 00:50:43.543
You could fuck off too.

524
00:50:43.578 --> 00:50:45.149
You're lucky.

525
00:50:45.184 --> 00:50:47.712
I'm hit plenty of times.
never felt lucky about it.

526
00:51:09.538 --> 00:51:10.636
Is that a gun?

527
00:51:15.841 --> 00:51:16.642
I'm so sorry.

528
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:24.617
I should be here.

529
00:51:27.886 --> 00:51:29.424
You should be home.

530
00:51:33.694 --> 00:51:34.396
I'm sorry.

531
00:51:37.698 --> 00:51:39.599
No.

532
00:51:39.634 --> 00:51:40.567
No.

533
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.406
There's nothing ever
you feel sorry about.

534
00:51:48.214 --> 00:51:49.609
For everything else.

535
00:52:33.424 --> 00:52:34.654
They're coming.

536
00:52:34.689 --> 00:52:35.292
Run.

537
00:52:39.562 --> 00:52:39.956
Run.

538
00:53:30.008 --> 00:53:30.677
Run.

539
00:53:49.368 --> 00:53:49.894
Whoa.

540
00:53:49.929 --> 00:53:51.863
Whoa.

541
00:53:51.898 --> 00:53:53.634
God damn. what a rush.

542
00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.002
Here. take that.

543
00:54:06.517 --> 00:54:07.846
Get my good side.

544
00:54:07.881 --> 00:54:09.320
But you don't have a good side.

545
00:54:17.363 --> 00:54:19.429
Make sure I get a set of prints.

546
00:54:24.667 --> 00:54:26.997
We got a live one here.

547
00:54:27.032 --> 00:54:27.635
Yeah.

548
00:54:30.035 --> 00:54:32.805
That's 10 bucks you owe me.

549
00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.774
Best 10 bucks I ever spent.

550
00:54:39.385 --> 00:54:40.450
Adios.

551
00:54:40.485 --> 00:54:41.385
No.

552
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:46.390
He's mine.

553
00:57:11.229 --> 00:57:14.637
I think I hit her. 50
meters straight ahead.

554
00:57:14.672 --> 00:57:15.066
Rick.

555
00:57:29.951 --> 00:57:31.522
I think I hit her.

556
00:57:31.557 --> 00:57:34.525
She's got to be close.

557
00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.561
Did either of you see
which way she went?

558
00:57:37.596 --> 00:57:39.189
I didn't see shit.

559
00:57:39.224 --> 00:57:42.896
Wow. you were the
one who shot her.

560
00:57:42.931 --> 00:57:45.635
Start a skirmish
line. 50 feet apart.

561
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:48.198
We'll head straight
down to the water.

562
00:57:48.233 --> 00:57:51.872
Remember. she's got Gary's gun.

563
00:57:51.907 --> 00:57:54.611
It's got to be out
of ammo by now.

564
00:57:54.646 --> 00:57:55.711
Don't bet on it.

565
01:00:14.016 --> 01:00:14.410
Stop.

566
01:00:25.324 --> 01:00:27.291
I thought I heard something.

567
01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:41.943
No. forget it.

568
01:02:41.295 --> 01:02:43.460
If anyone hear me.
please. I need help.

569
01:02:43.495 --> 01:02:45.594
This is an emergency.

570
01:02:45.629 --> 01:02:46.463
Is anyone there?

571
01:03:01.986 --> 01:03:03.018
BROOKE Hello.

572
01:03:06.518 --> 01:03:08.452
Is anyone there?

573
01:03:08.487 --> 01:03:09.618
Please help me.

574
01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:12.027
I've been kidnapped
by three men.

575
01:03:12.062 --> 01:03:13.028
- Damn it.

576
01:03:13.063 --> 01:03:14.557
BROOKE Help me.

577
01:03:14.592 --> 01:03:15.195
Cap.

578
01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:32.047
What's the range on that thing?

579
01:03:32.082 --> 01:03:33.444
How the fuck should I know?

580
01:04:47.619 --> 01:04:48.486
Backroom is clear.

581
01:04:54.593 --> 01:04:55.460
It's clear.

582
01:04:55.495 --> 01:04:57.066
She's gone.

583
01:04:57.101 --> 01:04:58.199
Rick. she's got your rifle.

584
01:05:21.389 --> 01:05:24.423
There's no way she can
get off the island. right?

585
01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:26.524
You've been hunting
five years here. Gary.

586
01:05:30.233 --> 01:05:33.135
You know there's
no way off of here.

587
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:34.433
Not unless she swims.

588
01:05:41.244 --> 01:05:42.672
Impossible.

589
01:05:42.707 --> 01:05:46.445
It's 20 miles from this
island to the mainland.

590
01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.349
An average male with good
shape could probably do what?

591
01:05:49.384 --> 01:05:50.482
Three miles. tops.

592
01:05:54.323 --> 01:05:57.291
She's alone. and she's scared.

593
01:05:57.326 --> 01:05:59.491
There's no way she's
getting out of here.

594
01:06:28.291 --> 01:06:32.029
Bitch is bleeding.

595
01:06:46.672 --> 01:06:47.737
We got more over here.

596
01:06:56.682 --> 01:06:58.319
We need to put her
out of her misery.

597
01:07:30.386 --> 01:07:32.221
What are the odds of
someone seeing that?

598
01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:03.714
Hold up.

599
01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:19.664
What the fuck?

600
01:08:26.277 --> 01:08:27.441
What the hell is it?

601
01:08:38.322 --> 01:08:39.684
Fuck this.

602
01:08:52.567 --> 01:08:54.897
Fuck this.

603
01:08:54.932 --> 01:08:57.504
Fuck.

604
01:08:57.539 --> 01:09:00.804
Fuck it.

605
01:09:00.839 --> 01:09:01.574
Stay down.

606
01:09:01.609 --> 01:09:02.542
Fuck.

607
01:09:02.577 --> 01:09:04.181
Get me out of here. TJ.

608
01:09:06.614 --> 01:09:09.648
Oh. my God damn leg.

609
01:09:10.387 --> 01:09:10.847
Stay down.

610
01:09:17.592 --> 01:09:21.429
You got-- you got
to help me. man.

611
01:09:29.769 --> 01:09:32.935
I got something for you.

612
01:09:36.578 --> 01:09:38.512
Rick. hold on.

613
01:09:38.547 --> 01:09:40.514
You got to help me. man.

614
01:09:40.549 --> 01:09:41.845
S

615
01:09:47.424 --> 01:09:47.884
You got--

616
01:10:02.934 --> 01:10:05.935
Oh. my God damn legs.

617
01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:08.036
Stop moving.

618
01:10:08.071 --> 01:10:12.040
Gary. get the hell out
there and grab Rick.

619
01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:13.712
I'm not going out there.

620
01:10:13.747 --> 01:10:16.319
I'm hit!

621
01:10:16.354 --> 01:10:17.749
Oh. my God.

622
01:10:17.784 --> 01:10:18.783
Help me!

623
01:10:33.866 --> 01:10:34.832
Oh. God.

624
01:11:16.381 --> 01:11:18.711
Grab that medical kit.

625
01:11:18.746 --> 01:11:19.481
Fuck.

626
01:11:19.516 --> 01:11:20.416
It's empty.

627
01:11:20.451 --> 01:11:21.615
What?

628
01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:23.782
It's fucking empty.

629
01:11:27.458 --> 01:11:28.919
God damn it. Rick.

630
01:11:28.954 --> 01:11:29.986
Hang in there.

631
01:11:30.021 --> 01:11:31.823
Don't you die on me.

632
01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:36.861
I'm going to fix you up.

633
01:11:36.896 --> 01:11:37.499
Whiskey.

634
01:11:48.479 --> 01:11:50.974
You remember that time that
you rolled your sister's car

635
01:11:51.009 --> 01:11:52.844
off the road.

636
01:11:52.879 --> 01:11:56.078
You went right through
that damn windshield.

637
01:11:56.113 --> 01:11:59.620
You're invincible.

638
01:11:59.655 --> 01:12:00.984
Don't leave me.

639
01:12:01.019 --> 01:12:02.821
We can't do anything
until we kill

640
01:12:02.856 --> 01:12:05.758
that bitch that fucked you up.

641
01:12:05.793 --> 01:12:07.793
It doesn't look so bad. Rick.

642
01:12:07.828 --> 01:12:09.927
You knew that she
would start shooting.

643
01:12:09.962 --> 01:12:11.060
You saved her own skin.

644
01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:17.000
Don't tell Luann.

645
01:12:17.035 --> 01:12:17.902
Stop talking.

646
01:12:17.937 --> 01:12:18.738
I can't--

647
01:12:18.773 --> 01:12:19.442
Save your energy.

648
01:12:19.477 --> 01:12:20.135
I can't--

649
01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:20.806
I'm going to fix you up.

650
01:12:38.925 --> 01:12:41.431
Is anyone there?

651
01:12:41.466 --> 01:12:42.091
Can anyone hear me?

652
01:12:42.126 --> 01:12:43.961
Please. I need help.

653
01:12:47.131 --> 01:12:49.131
We say it was a
hunting accident.

654
01:12:49.166 --> 01:12:51.870
He's been shot a dozen times.

655
01:12:51.905 --> 01:12:53.608
We were drinking.

656
01:12:53.643 --> 01:12:57.744
He went out at night. never
returned. probably drowned.

657
01:12:57.779 --> 01:13:00.076
I'm still alive you. assholes.

658
01:13:00.111 --> 01:13:02.177
We're talking about the
worst case scenario. Rick.

659
01:13:05.787 --> 01:13:08.216
I don't feel so well.

660
01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:10.955
That nosy wife of his is
going to ask questions.

661
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:13.188
The Sheriff's Department is
going to ask questions too.

662
01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:14.695
Nothing we can't handle.

663
01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:16.499
But Luann. she's not
going to let this go.

664
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:21.097
BROOKE
Can anyone hear me?

665
01:13:21.132 --> 01:13:23.099
This is an emergency.

666
01:13:23.134 --> 01:13:26.542
I'm on an island somewhere
near Oakland County.

667
01:13:26.577 --> 01:13:29.578
One of them is a police officer.

668
01:13:29.613 --> 01:13:31.008
Is anyone out there?

669
01:13:31.043 --> 01:13:33.549
Please respond.

670
01:13:33.584 --> 01:13:35.650
What about plan B?

671
01:13:35.685 --> 01:13:37.982
Plan B should have
happened hours ago.

672
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.057
You take this.

673
01:13:47.092 --> 01:13:49.191
You kill anyone that
comes through that door.

674
01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:56.506
Except me or Gary.

675
01:14:23.931 --> 01:14:25.865
What are you going
to tell your wife?

676
01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.163
I haven't though about it.

677
01:14:27.198 --> 01:14:30.067
We need get our story straight.

678
01:14:30.102 --> 01:14:31.233
You all right?

679
01:14:31.268 --> 01:14:33.642
Yeah.

680
01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:35.611
We've known Rick a long time.

681
01:14:35.646 --> 01:14:38.812
If he survives this. we're
going to have to put him down.

682
01:14:41.784 --> 01:14:43.179
Those wounds are
going to require

683
01:14:43.214 --> 01:14:46.314
an awful lot of explaining.

684
01:14:46.349 --> 01:14:49.152
Where the hell are you going?

685
01:14:49.187 --> 01:14:50.186
Figure it my way.

686
01:16:47.877 --> 01:16:48.271
Get up.

687
01:17:08.161 --> 01:17:09.292
What are you going to do?

688
01:17:29.787 --> 01:17:31.886
I'm going to get
even for the arm.

689
01:17:31.921 --> 01:17:33.822
We'll carve up this
pretty little face.

690
01:19:25.364 --> 01:19:26.462
Where's Gary?

691
01:19:30.204 --> 01:19:31.368
I'm so cold.

692
01:19:51.995 --> 01:19:53.863
You'll get me off this
island. yeah. Teej?

693
01:19:56.527 --> 01:19:58.527
Yeah.

694
01:19:58.562 --> 01:20:00.331
I'm getting you off the island.

695
01:20:00.366 --> 01:20:02.201
I'm so cold.

696
01:20:02.236 --> 01:20:02.839
Fuck.

697
01:24:39.909 --> 01:24:41.612
Remember what I taught you. TJ.

698
01:25:37.307 --> 01:25:38.669
How the hell did you get--

699
01:25:38.704 --> 01:25:39.703
Held my breath.

700
01:25:48.912 --> 01:25:50.714
You cunt.

701
01:26:46.805 --> 01:26:47.870
It wasn't personal.
