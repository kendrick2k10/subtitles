00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:51.471
English named Andy.

357
00:16:51.506 --> 00:16:53.341
But I feel more lonely
than before.

358
00:16:53.376 --> 00:16:56.542
People around me also listen
to soulless. heartless music.

359
00:16:56.577 --> 00:16:58.412
EDM. fuck that.

360
00:16:58.447 --> 00:17:00.810
So I was like. ugh.
I'm going like a man on--

361
00:17:00.845 --> 00:17:03.483
I'm like a man on an island.

362
00:17:03.518 --> 00:17:04.550
Very fucking lonely.

363
00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:06.189
So I weep. weep.

364
00:17:06.224 --> 00:17:08.521
After that I weep. weep. weep.

365
00:17:08.556 --> 00:17:10.490
That's just too much weeping.

366
00:17:10.525 --> 00:17:13.328
I stay long. eventually
they put me in Garden Oaks

367
00:17:13.363 --> 00:17:14.725
where I meet Bill.

368
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.200
(muffled shouting)

369
00:17:17.235 --> 00:17:19.400
Hey.

370
00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:22.799
You look like the kind of guy
who could use a best friend.

371
00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:25.604
I ain't gonna lie.
I'm that kind of guy too.

372
00:17:25.639 --> 00:17:28.178
(laughing)

373
00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.213
So why did you go in?

374
00:17:30.248 --> 00:17:32.380
I've been in many times.

375
00:17:32.415 --> 00:17:35.086
This time I was just being loud.

376
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:36.384
I don't have anywhere
to live right now

377
00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:38.584
so I just--I stay
with my sister sometimes

378
00:17:38.619 --> 00:17:41.719
but most of the time
she just kicks me out.

379
00:17:41.754 --> 00:17:44.458
And a few weeks ago
I had a cut on my foot

380
00:17:44.493 --> 00:17:47.824
and the only place I could wash
it was in a drinking fountain.

381
00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:50.299
So I was just minding my own
business washing my foot

382
00:17:50.334 --> 00:17:52.400
and everybody was
just staring at me

383
00:17:52.435 --> 00:17:54.798
-like I was shit.
-They are wrong.

384
00:17:54.833 --> 00:17:56.206
You are very much.

385
00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:57.207
Thanks.

386
00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:59.572
Well. I was yelling at them

and it just freaked

388
00:18:01.576 --> 00:18:03.477

389
00:18:03.512 --> 00:18:05.281

to Sterling Springs

1062
00:47:23.534 --> 00:47:25.072
That's not important.

1063
00:47:25.107 --> 00:47:26.876
Let me tell you something.

1064
00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:29.637
I got in a huge fight
with Bonnie about you.

1065
00:47:29.672 --> 00:47:31.111
What do you mean? How so?

1066
00:47:31.146 --> 00:47:33.344
So basically
she gave me a show--

1067
00:47:33.379 --> 00:47:34.884
how do you say. showdown?

1068
00:47:34.919 --> 00:47:35.951
Showdown.

1069
00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:38.151
She gave me a showdown.
she's like.

1070
00:47:38.186 --> 00:47:41.484
"Andy. it's you and me
or you with Bill."

1071
00:47:41.519 --> 00:47:43.585
And then you just came
right over here?

1072
00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.026
(Bill laughs)

1073
00:47:45.061 --> 00:47:46.027
That's fuckin' awesome. dude.

1074
00:47:46.062 --> 00:47:48.524
I'd have given anything
to see her expression.

1075
00:47:48.559 --> 00:47:51.560
Was she just like.
"Oh. Andy. please stay with me?

1076
00:47:51.595 --> 00:47:53.903
I'm so sorry.
I love you. Andy.

1077
00:47:53.938 --> 00:47:55.036
I made a mistake."

1078
00:47:56.105 --> 00:47:57.533
Fuck. Bill. I have to move out.

1079
00:47:57.568 --> 00:47:59.073
Wait. she said that or...

1080
00:47:59.108 --> 00:48:00.305
No. I decide to move out.

1081
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.175

1083
00:48:03.409 --> 00:48:04.639

1084
00:48:04.674 --> 00:48:05.506

1085

This is your home. man.

-I know you're in love.

1087

from being part of it.

1090

being a part of this.

1091
00:48:17.225 --> 00:48:19.093
That's just 'cause
I fought with her. man.

1092
00:48:19.128 --> 00:48:20.996
I'm serious. dude.
I can get her some flowers.

1093
00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:23.394

I can make things up to her.

1094

00:53:07.483 --> 00:53:09.449
If you love someone.
you want to be around them.

1232
00:53:09.484 --> 00:53:11.616
-That's the whole fucking point.
-I'm finally in love.

1233
00:53:11.651 --> 00:53:13.453
-(unintelligible)
-You keep saying "love"

1234
00:53:13.488 --> 00:53:15.587
so many fucking times.
it's lost all meaning.

1235
00:53:15.622 --> 00:53:16.687
You love. love. love.

1236
00:53:16.722 --> 00:53:17.820
-Yeah. yeah.
-Yeah. yeah?

1237
00:53:17.855 --> 00:53:19.261
But I'm a part of it. Andy.

1238
00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:20.427

1239
00:53:20.462 --> 00:53:22.231
You're not gonna be
a part of this.

1240
00:53:22.266 --> 00:53:23.958
Yes. I am. okay?

1241
00:53:23.993 --> 00:53:26.895
I don't care what you think
or what you're thinking now

1242
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:28.336
or what you thought.

1243
00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:29.634
Open your heart to me.

1244
00:53:29.669 --> 00:53:32.340
Open your fucking heart to me
like we promised

1245
00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:33.803
and talked about. Mommy.

1246
00:53:33.838 --> 00:53:34.969
-Do you remember?
-You're insane.

1247
00:53:35.004 --> 00:53:35.937
I called the cops.

1248
00:53:35.972 --> 00:53:38.247
Good. me and the boys in blue
go way back.

1249
00:53:38.282 --> 00:53:39.710
I can't wait
for a little reunion.

1250
00:53:39.745 --> 00:53:41.679
Bring 'em on. bring 'em on.
let's see what happens.

1251
00:53:41.714 --> 00:53:42.812
-Bill. Bill. Bill...
-Bullets!

1252
00:53:42.847 --> 00:53:44.484
Bill. just leave.
don't go to jail.

1253
00:53:44.519 --> 00:53:46.420
I'm not going to jail.
I didn't do anything.

1254
00:53:46.455 --> 00:53:48.422
Look at that.
you're breaking and entering!

1255
00:53:48.457 --> 00:53:50.457
-You also assault me.
-Assault?

1256
00:53:50.492 --> 00:53:52.327
You ever think maybe
I'm trying to just open up

1257
00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:54.263
a fucking third eye
on your head. huh. huh?

1258
00:53:54.298 --> 00:53:56.331
-You think that maybe. huh?
-Hey. stop.

1259
00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:58.531
-She needs to see God again.
-Don't point your finger at me.

1260
00:53:58.566 --> 00:53:59.832
She needs a place
where she can see God.

1261
00:53:59.868 --> 00:54:02.337
This is the kind of insane talk
that I don't want to be around.

1262
00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:04.339
That's the kind of talk you need
'cause you need to see God

1263
00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:05.868
and you've been thinking it
since I met you.

1264
00:54:05.903 --> 00:54:07.573
I can see it
in your fucking eyes.

1265
00:54:07.608 --> 00:54:09.278
there's no God here.

1266
00:54:09.313 --> 00:54:10.609
-What?
-You leave.

1267
00:54:10.644 --> 00:54:12.006
-I leave?
-Yeah. you showed who you are

1268
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:13.744
you made her upset.
I don't want...

1269
00:54:13.779 --> 00:54:16.450
Oh. look at you.
Mr. Fucking Calm. huh?

1270
00:54:16.485 --> 00:54:18.320
You remember who used
to pet your head. huh.

1271
00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:20.322
when you were all suicidal
and crying?

1272
00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:21.950
-Who did that?
-It's not like that anymore.

1273
00:54:21.985 --> 00:54:23.490
-It's not. no?
-It's not like that anymore.

1274
00:54:23.525 --> 00:54:25.492
Yeah. 'cause you get one sip
of the golden cup.

1275
00:54:25.527 --> 00:54:27.593

-Babble?

Rhapsody. motherfucker.
That's rhapsody.

1279
00:54:34.338 --> 00:54:35.568
-Stop! Bill. stop.
-Listen.

1280
00:54:35.603 --> 00:54:37.438
you really want me
to fucking leave. huh?

1281
00:54:37.473 --> 00:54:38.571
-Yup.
-You want me to leave?

1282
00:54:38.606 --> 00:54:39.739
-Yeah. do you?
-Please leave.

1283
00:54:39.774 --> 00:54:41.772
Okay. look me in the eyes.
tell me you don't love me.

1284
00:54:41.807 --> 00:54:42.840
-I don't love you.
-Okay. fine.

No love?

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:01.328
just stay totally quiet.
stay totally quiet.

1581
01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:02.062
-Okay.
-Okay?

1582
01:10:02.097 --> 01:10:03.561
I'm just gonna wait out here.

1583
01:10:03.596 --> 01:10:05.893
so whenever you're ready
to talk. let me know.

1584
01:10:05.928 --> 01:10:07.829
-I got cigarettes.
-Cigarettes!

1585
01:10:07.864 --> 01:10:09.501
What do we do?

1586
01:10:09.536 --> 01:10:12.273
-You know what I say. Andy?
-You say shit all the time.

1587
01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:15.375
I say if you see a snake
in the woods. gobble it up.

1588
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:17.476
Put that kid in the bathroom.

1589
01:10:18.743 --> 01:10:20.347
Go. go. go. stay inside.

1590
01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:23.416
Your uncle Bill and Daddy
need to fight a monster.

1591
01:10:23.451 --> 01:10:25.880
You want me to go
in the bathroom?

1592
01:10:30.887 --> 01:10:32.326
(exhales)

1593
01:10:34.726 --> 01:10:36.264
-Hey.
-Bill?

1594
01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:38.530
Yeah. Beautiful Bill.
Come on in. come on in. dude.

1595
01:10:38.565 --> 01:10:39.531
(laughing)

1596
01:10:39.566 --> 01:10:40.398
Turn the fuck around.

1597
01:10:40.434 --> 01:10:42.028
Put your hands
behind your back. now.

1598
01:10:42.063 --> 01:10:43.370
Put your hands
behind your back.

1599
01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:44.438
Why are you doing this?
I just--

1600
01:10:44.473 --> 01:10:45.999
-I'm doing this because--
-There's no tr--

1601
01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:48.573
I don't know who--
hey. buddy. buddy. buddy.

1602
01:10:48.608 --> 01:10:51.576
I don't know who the fuck
you are. all right?

1603
01:10:51.611 --> 01:10:52.775
Put your wrists together.

1604
01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:53.908
Put them together.

1605
01:10:53.943 --> 01:10:55.580
I...

1606
01:10:55.615 --> 01:10:57.417
-There you go.
-I just wanted to talk

1607
01:10:57.452 --> 01:10:58.318
to you guys.

1608
01:10:58.353 --> 01:11:00.046
Never been fucking
tied up before. huh?

1609
01:11:00.081 --> 01:11:00.913
No.

1610
01:11:00.949 --> 01:11:02.785
Well. first time
for everything. bud.

1611
01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:03.918
Turn the fuck around.

1612
01:11:03.953 --> 01:11:04.919
(grunts)

1613
01:11:04.954 --> 01:11:06.525
Huh. huh. huh?

1614
01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:07.592
Look at me.

1615
01:11:07.627 --> 01:11:09.055
What are you doing here?

1616
01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:10.991
-I just wanted to talk--
-What the fuck is this?

1617
01:11:11.026 --> 01:11:13.301
It's whiskey 'cause I wanted
to have a drink with you guys.

1618
01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:14.401
No. that's poison.
all right?

1619
01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:15.535
We're not drinking your poison.

1620
01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:17.998
and I'm not falling
for your fucking tricks. okay?

1621
01:11:18.033 --> 01:11:19.835
-What's going on?
-I know that

1622
01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:21.309
you took George. all right?

1623
01:11:21.344 --> 01:11:22.805
Bullshit. that did not happen.

1624
01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:23.938
We did not take George.

1625
01:11:23.973 --> 01:11:25.544
I don't even know who that is.

1626
01:11:25.579 --> 01:11:26.941
(chuckling)

1627
01:11:26.976 --> 01:11:28.811
I know you took him.
and I understand.

1628
01:11:28.846 --> 01:11:30.417
If I was in your position.

1629
01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.749
I'd probably do the same thing.
okay?

1630
01:11:32.784 --> 01:11:34.388
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

1631
01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:35.851
If you will just listen to me.

1632
01:11:35.886 --> 01:11:38.018
I basically just wanted
to kind of lay things out

1633
01:11:38.053 --> 01:11:40.493
from a different perspective
and have a rational conversation

1634
01:11:40.528 --> 01:11:41.593
without this shit going on.

1635
01:11:41.628 --> 01:11:42.759
What. this shit?

1636
01:11:42.794 --> 01:11:43.991
This isn't a boardroom. okay?

1637
01:11:44.026 --> 01:11:45.630
We're not a couple
of your investors.

1638
01:11:45.665 --> 01:11:46.730
and we're not gonna watch

1639
01:11:46.765 --> 01:11:47.931
a friffin'
PowerPoint presentation

1640
01:11:47.966 --> 01:11:50.338
on how you're some kind
of man of the hour. get that?

1641
01:11:50.373 --> 01:11:51.572
I'm not trying to talk
like that.

1642
01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:53.473
-I'm not trying to sound--
-You are talking like that.

1643
01:11:53.508 --> 01:11:54.903
you're sounding like
a fucking fake.

1644
01:11:54.938 --> 01:11:55.970
-Okay...
-Do you get it?

1645
01:11:56.005 --> 01:11:57.411
I'm not trying to sound phony.

1646
01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:58.312
I'm sorry. I'm just nervous.

1647
01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:00.007
What do you expect with
a gun in my face?

1648
01:12:00.042 --> 01:12:01.613
What do I expect?
I expect behavior.

1649
01:12:01.648 --> 01:12:02.746
I expect compliance.

1650
01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:04.044
Andy. you can vouch for me.

1651
01:12:04.079 --> 01:12:05.353
I don't know you.

1652
01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:06.717
We know each other a little bit.

1653
01:12:06.752 --> 01:12:08.048
Now you think I'm important?

1654
01:12:08.083 --> 01:12:09.786
Now you're asking me for help?

1655
01:12:09.821 --> 01:12:10.886
You ruined my life.

1656
01:12:10.921 --> 01:12:12.393
You ruined his fucking life.

1657
01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:13.856
Look. you know me--
you know me a little bit--

1658
01:12:13.891 --> 01:12:15.561
-I don't know you.
-It's nothing personal.

1659
01:12:15.596 --> 01:12:17.464
No. no. Andy does.
and you. I know--

1660
01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:18.927
I know about you
from stories.

1661
01:12:18.962 --> 01:12:20.995
Yeah? What kinda stories?
Horror stories?

1662
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:23.437
And now you walked into one.
ding-dong.

1663
01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:25.472
You don't need to do this.
all I wanted to do

1664
01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:27.573
was just come here and show you
I'm a good. honest person.

1665
01:12:27.608 --> 01:12:30.004
That's. you know. we're gonna be
the judge of who you are.

1666
01:12:30.039 --> 01:12:31.775
Sam. where'd you get
all your money?

1667
01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:33.711
Why you are so rich?
Where's your money from?

1668
01:12:33.746 --> 01:12:34.811
Where's your fucking money from?

1669
01:12:34.846 --> 01:12:36.417
From--just from tech.

1670
01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:37.781
Technology. technology.

1671
01:12:37.816 --> 01:12:38.915
That's fucking boring.

1672
01:12:38.951 --> 01:12:40.916
Fine. it's boring.
but you know. it doesn't matter

1673
01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:43.116
'cause there's two things
that can happen now. all right?

1674
01:12:43.151 --> 01:12:45.459
One. the cops can get involved
if you guys keep this up

1675
01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:48.121
and Bonnie flips out and then
you never see George again.

1676
01:12:48.156 --> 01:12:50.090
but there's the other option.
if you listen to me.

1677
01:12:50.125 --> 01:12:52.158
where you give me George
and I put him back in bed.

1678
01:12:52.193 --> 01:12:54.501
I get him home real quick
before Bonnie knows anything.

1679
01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.162
and we can forget
any of this ever happened.

1680
01:12:56.197 --> 01:12:58.538
All right. and then I'll talk to
Bonnie and I'll reason with her

1681
01:12:58.573 --> 01:13:02.003
and I'll make sure you guys
are a part of George's life.

1682
01:13:04.447 --> 01:13:06.843
Or. how about this.
what about this option?

1683
01:13:06.878 --> 01:13:09.516
What do you say to me just
blowing your cock off right now?

1684
01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.111
What would you say to that?

1685
01:13:11.146 --> 01:13:12.684
-Don't.
-Don't?

1686
01:13:12.719 --> 01:13:13.949
(Bill laughs)

1687
01:13:13.984 --> 01:13:15.555
Sam. I actually like that.

1688
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:17.920
Succinct. smart.

1689
01:13:17.955 --> 01:13:19.658
You know. if you say
enough things I like.

1690
01:13:19.693 --> 01:13:20.791
guess what happens then.

1691
01:13:20.826 --> 01:13:22.023
What?

1692
01:13:22.058 --> 01:13:24.190
-Could end up liking ya.
-Great. I'd like that.

1693
01:13:24.225 --> 01:13:26.467
You would? Why?

1694
01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:27.535
Because I like you!

1695
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.503
You don't like me.
you don't fucking know me!

1696
01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:31.098
I'd like to know you.
I like your vibe.

1697
01:13:31.133 --> 01:13:32.638
Fucking empty compliments.

1698
01:13:32.673 --> 01:13:33.672
Come here.

1699
01:13:33.708 --> 01:13:35.641
You don't need--
you don't need to do this.

1700
01:13:35.676 --> 01:13:36.575
Hey. fuck you.

1701
01:13:36.611 --> 01:13:39.073
Look. you stay right
the fuck here. okay?

1702
01:13:39.108 --> 01:13:40.206
Look. stay right here.

1703
01:13:40.241 --> 01:13:42.483
Look at me!
Stay here. okay?

1704
01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:45.079
You fucking move an inch
while we're gone.

1705
01:13:45.114 --> 01:13:47.114
cock off. life gone.
cock off. life gone.

1706
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:48.522
That fucking order.

1707
01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.458
You will feel it.

1708
01:13:53.826 --> 01:13:55.056
What do you think?

1709
01:13:55.091 --> 01:13:56.156
I hate that motherfucker!

1710
01:13:56.191 --> 01:13:58.059
Yeah. I see why
you feel that way.

1711
01:13:58.094 --> 01:13:59.830
-You don't?
-Well. I mean.

1712
01:13:59.865 --> 01:14:01.469
I know I'm being
all macho in there.

1713
01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:02.602
but I don't think he's lying.

1714
01:14:02.637 --> 01:14:03.966
Dude. he's a fucking liar!

1715
01:14:04.001 --> 01:14:05.737
Look at you though.
you're an emotional mess.

1716
01:14:05.772 --> 01:14:07.134
You can't even think straight.
dude.

1717
01:14:07.169 --> 01:14:08.068
You can think straight?

1718
01:14:08.104 --> 01:14:10.874
Yeah. yeah. straight
as a black arrow. okay?

1719
01:14:10.909 --> 01:14:12.975
And I think if we just sit him
down and we have a talk--

1720
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:15.681
We walk in. we kill him.
we go to Mexico.

1721
01:14:15.716 --> 01:14:17.848
You know I've never
really killed anybody. right?

1722
01:14:17.883 --> 01:14:19.245
I've been lying.
I've been telling fibs.

1723
01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.522
If you're my best friend.
you fucking kill him.

1724
01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:24.756
Yeah. I will kill him.
I'll kill anybody you want.

1725
01:14:24.791 --> 01:14:27.154
but you gotta give me three
minutes with him first. okay?

1726
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:28.496
I gotta check something.

1727
01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:30.223
-Three minutes?
-Three minutes.

1728
01:14:30.258 --> 01:14:32.225
You're asking me
to fucking kill somebody. okay?

1729
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.062
It's the least you can do.

1730
01:14:34.097 --> 01:14:35.228
(door opens)

1731
01:14:38.673 --> 01:14:39.705
(door closes)

1732
01:14:41.610 --> 01:14:42.642
(exhales)

1733
01:14:42.677 --> 01:14:44.908
A lot of options here. Sam.

1734
01:14:44.943 --> 01:14:47.614
You're a businessman.
you know it's hard to. uh.

1735
01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:50.716
pull the trigger sometimes.
so to speak.

1736
01:14:50.751 --> 01:14:52.751
Come here.

1737
01:14:52.786 --> 01:14:56.854
Think you made a few mistakes
with my buddy out there.

1738
01:14:56.889 --> 01:14:58.559
Come a little closer.

1739
01:14:58.594 --> 01:15:00.253
Perch up real good.

1740
01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:06.292
So. we're gonna play a game now.

1741
01:15:06.327 --> 01:15:08.063
I'm not talking Monopoly.

1742
01:15:08.098 --> 01:15:11.638
I'm talking Ouija board.
next-level shit.

1743
01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:13.607
You ready for that?

1744
01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:14.608
Sure.

1745
01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:17.237
Let me ask you a question first.

1746
01:15:17.272 --> 01:15:18.612
Are you a good man?

1747
01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:19.679
I'm okay.

1748
01:15:19.714 --> 01:15:21.208
You sure about that?

1749
01:15:21.243 --> 01:15:22.880
Yeah.

1750
01:15:22.915 --> 01:15:24.585
(sighs)

1751
01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:27.016
You ever go crazy before?

1752
01:15:27.051 --> 01:15:30.591
Like your head was spinning
around in a dryer set on high?

1753
01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:32.956
-Huh. have you?
-Yeah.

1754
01:15:32.991 --> 01:15:34.628
-For real?
-Yeah.

1755
01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:35.860
Yeah?

1756
01:15:35.895 --> 01:15:38.698
All right.
then you're invited in.

1757
01:15:38.733 --> 01:15:41.261
Stare into my eyes. okay.
stare deep into my eyes.

1758
01:15:41.296 --> 01:15:42.966
Not this one. this one's dead.

1759
01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:45.067
-Stare here.
-All right.

1760
01:15:45.102 --> 01:15:46.970
Come on in.

1761
01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:49.577
Come in.

1762
01:15:49.612 --> 01:15:50.578
Deeper.

1763
01:15:50.613 --> 01:15:52.272
Come on. deeper.

1764
01:15:52.307 --> 01:15:54.747
Deeper. deeper.

1765
01:15:54.782 --> 01:15:56.947
Don't fear the sharks
of my soul.

1766
01:15:56.982 --> 01:15:59.686
I only look scary.

1767
01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:04.757
I need you to think
about dragons. okay?

1768
01:16:04.792 --> 01:16:05.923
Got 'em?

1769
01:16:05.958 --> 01:16:07.793
-Got it.
-Good.

1770
01:16:07.828 --> 01:16:09.025
(exhales)

1771
01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:12.930
That's very. very. very good.

1772
01:16:12.965 --> 01:16:14.932
You're a sensitive man.
aren't you. Sam?

1773
01:16:14.967 --> 01:16:16.604
I'm okay.

1774
01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:18.903
Yeah. I know you're okay.

1775
01:16:18.938 --> 01:16:20.674
Are you sensitive?

1776
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:21.708
Yes. I am.

1777
01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:24.073
Yeah. I can tell.

1778
01:16:24.108 --> 01:16:26.306
I like it.

1779
01:16:26.341 --> 01:16:29.375
I like it a lot.

1780
01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:31.916
Do you feel weird
about being rich?

1781
01:16:31.951 --> 01:16:33.115
All the time.

1782
01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:36.349
Why don't you give
all your money away?

1783
01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:39.253
I'm scared I won't make
any more.

1784
01:16:39.288 --> 01:16:42.157
Why'd you buy
such a big old house?

1785
01:16:42.192 --> 01:16:44.159
I don't know. I thought
it would impress the girls.

1786
01:16:44.194 --> 01:16:45.226
Did it?

1787
01:16:45.261 --> 01:16:47.261
-Yeah.
-Yeah. bees like honey.

1788
01:16:47.296 --> 01:16:49.230
Big news.

1789
01:16:49.265 --> 01:16:51.100
All right.

1790
01:16:51.135 --> 01:16:53.641
I'm gonna forgive the wealth.

1791
01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:56.303
Can you forgive my being poor?

1792
01:16:56.338 --> 01:16:58.679
-Yes.
-You know how poor I am?

1793
01:16:58.714 --> 01:17:00.978
-No.
-I have $11.

1794
01:17:01.013 --> 01:17:01.979
That's it.

1795
01:17:02.014 --> 01:17:03.948
(exhales)

1796
01:17:03.983 --> 01:17:06.280
We're gonna go
to the next level now.

1797
01:17:06.315 --> 01:17:08.381
'cause I'm seeing
some good things in you.

1798
01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:10.724
Can you put the gun down?

1799
01:17:12.156 --> 01:17:13.386
(gun tapping)

1800
01:17:15.291 --> 01:17:17.929
We're going in deeper now.

1801
01:17:17.964 --> 01:17:20.195
We're gonna go somewhere
not a lot of people have been.

1802
01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:22.032
-Are you ready for that?
-Okay.

1803
01:17:23.871 --> 01:17:27.301
Move away from the live eye.

1804
01:17:27.336 --> 01:17:30.139
Go into the dead eye. okay?

1805
01:17:30.174 --> 01:17:32.207
Stare into the eye
of old Dead-Eye Bill.

1806
01:17:33.243 --> 01:17:36.376
Pass through that darkness.

1807
01:17:36.411 --> 01:17:37.883
In there?

1808
01:17:37.918 --> 01:17:39.753
(deep exhale)

1809
01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:43.416
Oh yeah. you're in there.

1810
01:17:43.451 --> 01:17:46.991
We're gonna have to do this
for a long. long time.

1811
01:17:47.026 --> 01:17:49.994
and you're gonna show me
just who you are.

1812
01:17:50.029 --> 01:17:52.832
(train rumbling)

1813
01:18:00.435 --> 01:18:03.172
(clacking slows)

1814
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:12.478
(eerie high-pitched sound)

1815
01:18:12.513 --> 01:18:14.821
(heart beating)

1816
01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:16.988
(train whistle blowing)

1817
01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:21.960
(gasps)

1818
01:18:25.163 --> 01:18:26.932
Whoa!

1819
01:18:26.967 --> 01:18:28.835
(exhales)

1820
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:31.233
Okay. Sam.

1821
01:18:31.268 --> 01:18:32.806
Okay.

1822
01:18:34.205 --> 01:18:35.336
(door opens)

1823
01:18:37.538 --> 01:18:38.504
-Hey.
-Yeah.

1824
01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:39.438
So?

1825
01:18:39.474 --> 01:18:41.177
So he's a living.
breathing man. dude.

1826
01:18:41.212 --> 01:18:42.882
Living. breathing man?

1827
01:18:42.917 --> 01:18:44.818
Yeah. yeah. he's good. okay?

1828
01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.019
I took him into the house
of my soul.

1829
01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:48.250
I spun him around. I looked
at him from every fucking angle.

1830
01:18:48.285 --> 01:18:50.120
and he's good.
and we should give him the kid.

1831
01:18:50.155 --> 01:18:52.122
No! Fuck this. fuck this plan.
Give me the gun.

1832
01:18:52.157 --> 01:18:53.519
Put your money
where your mouth is.

1833
01:18:53.554 --> 01:18:55.323
-What do you mean?
-I mean we're always talking

1834
01:18:55.358 --> 01:18:57.424
love. right?
Love. love. love?

1835
01:18:57.459 --> 01:18:59.162
-Try to love him.
-Oh my God.

1836
01:18:59.197 --> 01:19:01.164
this is the guy
who ruined my fucking life.

1837
01:19:01.199 --> 01:19:03.199
-who stole my fucking family.
-Yeah. yeah. right?

1838
01:19:03.234 --> 01:19:05.971
Now he's inviting you back
into his family. right?

1839
01:19:06.006 --> 01:19:07.808
He invited me back
into his fucking family?

1840
01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:08.875
Give me the gun.
give me the gun.

1841
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:10.239
-Fine. you want the gun?
-Yeah.

1842
01:19:10.274 --> 01:19:11.507
-Fine. here.
-This is my fucking choice.

1843
01:19:11.542 --> 01:19:13.979
-this is my fucking choice.
-Fine. here's the fucking gun.

1844
01:19:14.014 --> 01:19:17.048
but listen. you kill him.
little George hears. right?

1845
01:19:17.083 --> 01:19:19.820
Right? And we can tell him
it's big. big popcorn right now.

1846
01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:21.415
but when he turns 13.
old man memory

1847
01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:23.956
is gonna start answering
questions and he's gonna know.

1848
01:19:23.991 --> 01:19:25.991
He's gonna know Uncle Bill
and Daddy Andy

1849
01:19:26.026 --> 01:19:27.388
are fucking murderers.

1850
01:19:27.423 --> 01:19:29.093
You think that's good for a kid?

1851
01:19:29.128 --> 01:19:31.260
You think that's good
for sensitive guys like us?

1852
01:19:31.295 --> 01:19:32.998
It'll fucking make us cry. dude.

1853
01:19:33.033 --> 01:19:36.364
We'll be crying and having
nightmares about him for years.

1854
01:19:36.399 --> 01:19:39.367
and so will little George.
and then think about this. dude:

1855
01:19:39.402 --> 01:19:41.468
His ghost is gonna haunt us.

1856
01:19:41.503 --> 01:19:44.009
You want to spend the rest
of your life haunted by a ghost?

1857
01:19:44.044 --> 01:19:46.110
Fucking floating over your bed?

1858
01:19:46.145 --> 01:19:48.277
Dripping fucking ectoplasm
all over you.

1859
01:19:48.312 --> 01:19:49.916
you're all goopy and shit?

1860
01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:52.820
It's your choice.
you do what you want.

1861
01:19:52.855 --> 01:19:54.415
You think about it though.

1862
01:19:54.450 --> 01:19:56.824
Hey.

1863
01:19:56.859 --> 01:19:58.485
What are you gonna do?

1864
01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.388
(train whistle blowing)

1865
01:20:05.395 --> 01:20:07.197
(door opens)

1866
01:20:09.432 --> 01:20:10.464
(door closes)

1867
01:20:10.499 --> 01:20:12.873
Treat Bonnie and George right.

1868
01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:14.138
(groaning)

1869
01:20:14.173 --> 01:20:15.271
You lucked out. bud.

1870
01:20:15.306 --> 01:20:16.877
You're in the family.

1871
01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:21.211
Kid's in the bathroom.

1872
01:20:21.246 --> 01:20:22.476
You made the right choice.

1873
01:20:22.511 --> 01:20:24.885
You just better be as cool
as I think you are.

1874
01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.953
'cause I'm looking forward
to hanging out with you.

1875
01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:32.486
(engine rumbling)

1876
01:20:32.521 --> 01:20:34.026
(brakes squealing)

1877
01:20:35.227 --> 01:20:36.126
(sighs)

1878
01:20:36.162 --> 01:20:38.327
Bill. I feel like
I'm shattered apart.

1879
01:20:38.362 --> 01:20:41.033
It's 'cause you are. dude.
You are.

1880
01:20:41.068 --> 01:20:43.563
If I was Bonnie.
I would have left me too.

1881
01:20:43.598 --> 01:20:45.103
Dude. if you were Bonnie?

1882
01:20:45.138 --> 01:20:47.006
No. dude. you'd be stoked
that you met

1883
01:20:47.041 --> 01:20:49.569
one of the coolest individuals
of all time. all right?

1884
01:20:49.604 --> 01:20:51.340
Andy fucking Chen.

1885
01:20:51.375 --> 01:20:52.539
But Bonnie's Bonnie.

1886
01:20:52.574 --> 01:20:53.540
Bonnie's gone.

1887
01:20:53.575 --> 01:20:55.278
Yeah. well. who's here?

1888
01:20:55.313 --> 01:20:57.544
Your ultimate homie
now and forevermore.

1889
01:20:57.579 --> 01:21:01.020
Beautiful Bill Andrews
at your service.

1890
01:21:01.055 --> 01:21:02.582
Come on. let's get you a taco.

1891
01:21:02.617 --> 01:21:03.649
Come on.

1892
01:21:03.684 --> 01:21:05.222
Get you some food.

1893
01:21:05.257 --> 01:21:08.324
I'm talking tacos.
burritos. tostadas.

1894
01:21:08.359 --> 01:21:10.161
What kinda drink you want?

1895
01:21:10.196 --> 01:21:11.459
What do you want. Coca-Cola?

1896
01:21:11.494 --> 01:21:12.360
Cocktail.
