3
00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:39.125
Stop. police!

4
00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:42.166
Stop that girl!

5
00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:44.541
-Excuse me!

6
00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:47.500
-Terribly sorry.
-Oi!

7
00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:50.083
-Watch where you're sodding going!

8
00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:53.125
Stop her!

9
00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:10.541
Perhaps I should explain.

10
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.958
My name is Enola Holmes.

11
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.666
You may remember me.

12
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.333
After solving my first case…

13
00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.583
Hello.

14
00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:23.958
…I started a business.

15
00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:26.833
A detective agency.

16
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.375
Open and ready for my first clients.

17
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.583
I was going to join the pantheon
of great Victorian detectives.

18
00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:37.416
-Detective Field.
-Yes.

19
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.833
-Mackenzie Macintosh.
-Hi.

20
00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:40.625
-Sir Alfred Hornblower.
-Tally-ho!

21
00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:44.166
-And the infamous Reginald Swain.

22
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.541
And best of all.
I would be joining my brother.

23
00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:48.791
I would be his equal.

24
00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:52.666
A detective in my own right.

25
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:55.666
worthy of the Holmes name.

26
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.458
Congratulations.

27
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.583
-Or so I thought.

28
00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:11.166
Am I addressing the secretary?

29
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.708
You're how old?

30
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.375
-Stone the crows. you're young.
-My age is an advantage.

31
00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:20.208
I can go to places others can't.
explore where others won't.

32
00:02:20.291 --> 00:02:22.375
And I can fight. I know jujitsu.

33
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:28.125
But you're a girl.

34
00:02:28.208 --> 00:02:30.000
Yes. I am. Um…

35
00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:32.208
What experience have you had?

36
00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:38.000
-The Tewkesbury case?
-Well. that was Sherlock Holmes.

37
00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:39.166
-That was Sherlock--
-Sherlock--

38
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.083
-Sherlock Holmes. wasn't it?
-I assure you. it was mine.

39
00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:46.083
Good man. that Tewkesbury. Brave lad.

40
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.125
-Tell me--

41
00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.125
-Tell me--
-Yes?

42
00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:51.375
Might your brother be free?

43
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.833
Read all about it! Read all about it!

44
00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:59.708
Sherlock Holmes
and the case of the Brixton corpse.

45
00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:01.208
So. my brother.

46
00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:05.875
While I had not a single case.
Sherlock has been drowning in them.

47
00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.875
Though his latest
appears to be vexing him.

48
00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.916
My mother. meanwhile. is still on the run.

49
00:03:17.791 --> 00:03:20.208
And trying not to draw
attention to herself.

50
00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:25.916
Though that's never
been her forte.

51
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:45.666
Yes. and then there is… him.

52
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.291
My lords.
reform is not a task to be accomplished.

53
00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:50.958
nor a bill that can be passed.

54
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.083
Rather it is a constant need for change.

55
00:03:56.583 --> 00:04:01.250
Lord Tewkesbury.
the champion of change and progress.

56
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.375
A man to approach with the noblest cause.

57
00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:10.458
♪ Till we have built Jerusalem ♪

58
00:04:16.916 --> 00:04:19.041
But I had no time
for distractions.

59
00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.416
And besides. he's still a nincompoop.

60
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.833
Too many people
make it their sole purpose in life

61
00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:28.250
to fit into the world around them.

62
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:30.666
This is a mistake.

63
00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:33.750
It's your path. Enola.

64
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.333
Sometimes. you'll stumble.

65
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.916
Sometimes. you'll fall.

66
00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:41.708
But no matter how lost you feel.

67
00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:44.166
if you stay true to yourself.

68
00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:47.708
the path will always find you again.

69
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.708
But my path. it seemed.
had come to an end.

70
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.208
I was a failure.

71
00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:01.250
All I could do now was go home.

72
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.750
Enola Holmes?

73
00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:28.208
Yes?

74
00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:30.416
I've come to the right place then.

75
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:34.500
Is it true you find lost people?

76
00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:39.083
Where did you get this?

77
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.708
It's months old.

78
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.583
I found it on the street.

79
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:45.916
Who have you lost?

80
00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:49.583
My sister.

81
00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:05.458
Watch the gap.

82
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:15.500
She disappeared a week ago.

83
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.083
Everyone says she's run away.
but Sarah wouldn't do that.

84
00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:20.000
not to me.

85
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:22.750
She's my only family now.

86
00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:28.041
This way.

87
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.500
The other girls are still at work.

88
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.583
Tea?

89
00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:39.750
Thank you.

90
00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:42.875
Might I see her bedroom?

91
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.625
Ours. you mean?

92
00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:47.291
You're standing in it.

93
00:06:50.583 --> 00:06:53.125
We're lucky.
Most girls here are five to a room.

94
00:06:58.875 --> 00:06:59.791
This might help.

95
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.458
Oh. Sarah likes
to leave cheese out for 'em.

96
00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:09.083
She's soft.

97
00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:14.750
What does she look like. Sarah?

98
00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:16.458
About this tall.

99
00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:18.291
Pretty.

100
00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:19.500
Very pretty.

101
00:07:19.583 --> 00:07:22.541
Green eyes. red hair. freckles--

102
00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:23.875
Red hair?

103
00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:26.666
We weren't sisters in the usual way.

104
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.208
Found sisters.

105
00:07:29.041 --> 00:07:30.000
Sarah took her in.

106
00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:32.291
Who's this. Bess?

107
00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.208
-Enola Holmes.
-She's a detective.

108
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:37.291
She looks like
she'll blow over in the wind.

109
00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:38.250
Mae!

110
00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:45.416
So. Bessie. what was Sarah wearing
the day she disappeared?

111
00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:48.208
-What's she doing?
-Shh.

112
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:50.083
She's wasting her time.

113
00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:53.250
It was her other dress. the green one.

114
00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:57.458
Does she like reading?

115
00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:59.583
Oh yes. She taught herself.

116
00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:03.375
Sarah said you had to learn about
the world if you're gonna live in it.

117
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:09.625
Makeup.

118
00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:12.250
Did she have a suitor?

119
00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:15.208
Nah. But there's plenty
have taken an interest.

120
00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:19.916
She weren't much of a gardener.

121
00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:25.958
Look. how about you quit sniffing round?

122
00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:28.250
Quiet. Mae!
Just let her do her job.

123
00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:47.208
The 12th of March.
Does that date mean anything to you?

124
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:48.291
That's enough.

125
00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:50.833
We don't need help from people like you.

126
00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:53.708
I found her. so she's staying.

127
00:08:58.541 --> 00:09:00.833
-Bloody girls poking their nose in.

128
00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:04.916
-And she didn't leave a note?
-Just this.

129
00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:10.916
She worked two jobs. you see.
We couldn't get by without it.

130
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.708
Washed glasses at a pub.

131
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:15.333
Some place called The Stag Antlers.

132
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.375
You can have it.

133
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.416
Oh. No. it's all right.
We'll figure that out later.

134
00:09:23.291 --> 00:09:25.916
So tell me.
when was the last time you saw her?

135
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.208
A week ago. at the match factory.

136
00:09:29.291 --> 00:09:32.916
She had a fight with Mr. Crouch.
the foreman. in his office.

137
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.208
-What about?
-He said she was thieving.

138
00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:36.916
But Sarah's honest.

139
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.958
The match factory.
is that where she works?

140
00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:43.291
Where we all work.
We're match girls. ain't we?

141
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.416
-Then that's where we'll start.
-So you'll take it? You'll take the case?

142
00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:54.875
Thank you. Miss Holmes.

143
00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:56.250
Thank you.

144
00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:00.333
At last. my first case.

145
00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:01.791
Well. actually. my second.

146
00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:04.208
I shall find you. Sarah Chapman.

147
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:08.375
Red hair. green dress.
makeup. science books. 12th March.

148
00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:09.833
Whatever you've been up to…

149
00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:13.625
…the game is afoot.

150
00:10:15.041 --> 00:10:16.916
Stay with me. Follow my way.

151
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.083
-How many girls work here?
-Five hundred. maybe six.

152
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:25.583
How do I look?

153
00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:28.791
-Is my neckerchief all right?
-Oh. well. it's around your neck.

154
00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:30.833
Morning. Bessie.

155
00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:31.833
Morning. Doris.

156
00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:39.458
Mouth.

157
00:10:40.666 --> 00:10:41.500
Mouth.

158
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:44.250
-Mouth.
-Come on.

159
00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:46.666
-Next.
-Out.

160
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.791
-Please. Mr. Crouch.
-I said. out.

161
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.833
-Mouth.
-What are you looking at?

162
00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:55.166
Oi. new girl.
Name in the register.

163
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.833
Mouth.

164
00:11:04.583 --> 00:11:06.916
-What are you looking for?
-Typhus.

165
00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:16.541
That's the phosphorus.

166
00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:19.666
Don't worry. you get used to the smell.

167
00:11:29.708 --> 00:11:31.458
Is this where she worked?

168
00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:33.875
Put the matches on the comb…

169
00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:37.250
slide 'em along.

170
00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:39.541
up and into the box.

171
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.083
Simple enough.

172
00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:45.416
-You try.

173
00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:00.333
That is a penny off your wages.

174
00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:04.250
She's just learning the way.
Mr. Crouch.

175
00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:07.166
She better learn quicker.
or it's a penny off yours too.

176
00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:09.833
Anyone else want a money dock?

177
00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:11.833
How about you. eh?

178
00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:14.083
No. didn't think so.

179
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:18.458
Right. back to work.

180
00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:27.041
I need to get up into that office.

181
00:12:27.541 --> 00:12:28.958
Not a hope.

182
00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:43.875
No talking.

183
00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:48.083
All it takes is one small thing

184
00:12:48.166 --> 00:12:50.583
to change the rules of the world.

185
00:13:10.916 --> 00:13:13.291
Oi. Faster fingers. faster fingers.

186
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.875
Hurrah!

187
00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:21.250
How did that bloody happen. eh?

188
00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:23.750
Well. pick 'em up.

189
00:13:24.541 --> 00:13:25.541
Oi. pick 'em up.

190
00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:27.416
Pick 'em up. pick 'em up.

191
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:33.916
Right! Back to work.

192
00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:40.083
Why were you here?

193
00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:45.333
Come on. girls.

194
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.958
Red.

195
00:13:49.041 --> 00:13:50.333
Time's a-wasting.

196
00:13:51.833 --> 00:13:53.333
Don't you look at me like that. girl.

197
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.958
-Oi. stop talking!

198
00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:18.000
-Green eyes. red hair.

199
00:14:22.833 --> 00:14:24.708
So you did steal something.

200
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.041
Charles! This is not what I was
expecting when we made our arrangement.

201
00:14:30.125 --> 00:14:31.875
This is blatant extortion.

202
00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:32.916
Criminal!

203
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.250
-My pockets are empty.
-You think mine full?

204
00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:39.458
You gave me your word you'd find
whoever was doing this to us.

205
00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:42.541
You sound almost threatening. Mr. Lyon.

206
00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:45.791
This is not what I expected
when we began our arrangement.

207
00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:49.125
And now theft. on top of everything else.

208
00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:52.708
-You heard the man. Get this dealt with.
-Come along. William.

209
00:14:56.916 --> 00:15:00.375
Sir. do you have any suspicions
as to who this perpetrator might be?

210
00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:02.541
Would I be asking you if I did?

211
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:09.750
But. sir. perhaps if we were to consider
whether this theft is connected.

212
00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:12.416
-I have ideas--
-Did I ask for your advice?

213
00:15:13.083 --> 00:15:15.125
Or did I simply tell you to get it done?

214
00:15:15.958 --> 00:15:18.000
I'll make sure the right people know. sir.

215
00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:25.333
Miss Troy!

216
00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:26.875
Yes. sir.

217
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.500
Our ladies are working at the highest
level of production and efficiency.

218
00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:33.208
-Are they not. William?
-Yes. Father.

219
00:15:34.875 --> 00:15:37.666
-Please. if you will…

220
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.333
Doris. how are you? How's your sister?
Is she. um. still unwell?

221
00:15:41.416 --> 00:15:43.000
Uh. yes. Mr. Lyon.

222
00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:44.625
Typhus.

223
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.750
Really is the plague of our time.

224
00:15:48.625 --> 00:15:51.333
Two years it's been killing these girls.

225
00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:52.458
Breaks my heart.

226
00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:59.250
Well. Lord McIntyre. if I might suggest
a little lunch. I think we've earned it.

227
00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:06.500
How did Sarah do it?
Get into the office?

228
00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:10.291
There was a fire at one of the stations.
Foreman got distracted.

229
00:16:12.708 --> 00:16:13.583
Whose station?

230
00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:15.250
Mae's?

231
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:16.791
Yes.

232
00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:20.333
You're a good detective. Enola Holmes.

233
00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:32.791
Everyone thinks detecting
is a profession littered with rules.

234
00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:35.125
but in truth. there's only one.

235
00:16:35.208 --> 00:16:38.916
Pull on every loose thread you find.

236
00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:42.958
She's a loose thread.

237
00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:49.583
So I'm pulling at her.

238
00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:54.958
-Oh.
-Hello. sir.

239
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.833
-What a pleasant evening.
-Young lady. I'm afraid I'm married.

240
00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:21.708
Hello. dearie. Forgot your ticket?

241
00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:25.250
That's tuppence for a sweet.
cheating face like yours.

242
00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:26.916
Ha'penny a piece.

243
00:17:28.166 --> 00:17:30.375
-Genuine toffee.
-Out of my way. girl.

244
00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:31.791
Ha'penny a piece.

245
00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.333
Where are you. Mae?

246
00:17:35.166 --> 00:17:36.250
Excuse me. sir.

247
00:17:37.666 --> 00:17:39.958
I've never seen anything like it!

248
00:17:44.791 --> 00:17:47.583
And here she comes!

249
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.875
One. two.
a-one. two. three four.

Uh…

265
00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:11.958
Hm.

266
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:23.875
She worked two jobs. you see.

267
00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:26.875
Some place called The Stag Antlers.

Did Sarah work here?

271
00:19:44.708 --> 00:19:47.250
She did. didn't she?
And Bessie doesn't know.

272
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.708
There's plenty Bessie don't know.
And plenty you don't need to tell her.

273
00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:54.625
I know you helped her into that office.
She took those pages. Why?

274
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.416
-What's happened to her?
-Just leave us be. all right?

275

Posh girls like you
don't belong in this fight.

278
00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:11.875
You got more to you than I thought.

279
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:17.583
Whatever this is.
Mae is on stage in 30 ticks.

280
00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:19.416
and she's still dressed as a gent.

281
00:20:20.333 --> 00:20:22.708
So let go of her. now.

282
00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:28.041
-Get her out of here.
-Be my pleasure.

283
00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:32.708
Come on.

284
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.916
Where did Sarah Chapman do her makeup?

285
00:20:41.125 --> 00:20:44.000
Full of secrets that one.
and not a bad actress.

286
00:20:44.083 --> 00:20:46.291
I'd have given her the boot
if she weren't so good.

287
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:48.625
but she did attract the men
with big pockets.

288
00:20:48.708 --> 00:20:50.250
Always useful that. Shift it.

289
00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:53.041
Which men?

290
00:20:57.541 --> 00:21:01.083
There was this one gent. society type.
and he came regular.

291
00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:06.500
Very keen on him she was.
He'd send flowers. letters.

292
00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:12.916
His name?

293
00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:17.583
Never gave one.

294
00:21:18.583 --> 00:21:22.541
You see. they all think there's
hope. That love is coming their way.

295
00:21:23.583 --> 00:21:25.000
But it never is.

296
00:21:25.083 --> 00:21:27.250
Blokes like that. they want cheap.

297
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.375
but they marry dear.

298
00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.500
"As we two ate of the fruit of love…"

299
00:21:35.583 --> 00:21:38.083
The fruit of love? Ugh.

300
00:21:38.166 --> 00:21:40.666
"A bell did ring in the sky above"

301
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.750
"So wander that place
With its blossoms white"

302
00:21:43.833 --> 00:21:45.833
"A chapel awaits us out of sight"

303
00:21:47.791 --> 00:21:48.791
And a poppy.

304
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.458
Is that his name?

305
00:21:52.541 --> 00:21:53.958
Why did she leave?

306
00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:00.833
Did she run away with this fellow?

307
00:22:04.125 --> 00:22:05.875
Or is she running from him?

308
00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:10.916
I hope it's the latter.
His poetry is extremely bad.

309
00:23:00.958 --> 00:23:02.541
Be away with you. boy.

310
00:23:03.083 --> 00:23:03.916
All right.

311
00:23:08.208 --> 00:23:10.250
-Sherlock?
-Enola.

312
00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.625
What are you doing here? It's not safe.

313
00:23:13.708 --> 00:23:15.333
There are scary people about.

314
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:19.083
-Yes. let me know when you meet one.

315
00:23:19.791 --> 00:23:22.208
-Brother. are you quite yourself?
-I'm fine.

316
00:23:22.291 --> 00:23:25.833
It was just a disagreement
over a glass of wine

317
00:23:26.375 --> 00:23:27.583
and whose wine it was.

318
00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:28.541
And. uh…

319
00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:33.833
I find after wine. it's very difficult
to make your arms and legs move.

320
00:23:33.916 --> 00:23:34.875
Let's get you home.

321
00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:40.000
I don't usually imbibe.
but I'm on a case. you see.

322
00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:42.708
-It's proven rather tricky.
-Cab.

323
00:23:42.791 --> 00:23:44.208
-Hello.
-Hello.

324
00:23:44.708 --> 00:23:47.166
-Where are we going?
-221 Baker Street.

325
00:23:52.875 --> 00:23:56.416
As it turns out.
my brother is medievally heavy.

326
00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.250
It's like carrying a dead horse
on which sits another dead horse.

327
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.916
That's A. and I'm B.

328
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:10.916
I didn't know you had steps.

329
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.500
One should always have steps
to avoid people stepping on you.

330
00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:17.708
That's a tip.
You should probably write that down.

331
00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:20.541
All right. Lift your right leg.

332
00:24:21.333 --> 00:24:22.166
Mm-hmm.

333
00:24:23.875 --> 00:24:24.708
Now your left.

334
00:24:26.041 --> 00:24:28.833
Better leg. the left.
You should write that down.

335
00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:36.875
Ha! Home. Well done. Sherlock.

336
00:24:39.125 --> 00:24:40.125
I can do it.

337
00:24:43.666 --> 00:24:44.500
See?

338
00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:51.416
Baker Street.

339
00:24:58.458 --> 00:25:02.541
-Oh. but it's such a mess.
-It's perfect. Don't touch anything.

340
00:25:02.625 --> 00:25:04.458
What are you investigating?

341
00:25:04.541 --> 00:25:06.875
None of your business.
I work alone. It's private.

342
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:09.291
Now shh. I'm thinking.

343
00:25:09.791 --> 00:25:11.875
One should never be interrupted
when thinking.

344
00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:15.125
-Oh. You should--
-Write that down?

345
00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:19.041
-Shh!

346
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.166
Don't go in there.

347
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:24.333
No.

348
00:25:38.375 --> 00:25:40.000
Sherlock's latest case.

349
00:25:48.333 --> 00:25:49.458
Fascinating.

350
00:25:52.291 --> 00:25:56.000
And why. pray. have you moved everything?

351
00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:03.833
-Nothing looks different to me.
-Nothing looks different? Ev--

352
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.125
Your head is sore? I can't think why.

353
00:26:07.208 --> 00:26:09.916
This is why
I don't have people in my rooms.

354
00:26:10.708 --> 00:26:14.250
Look what you've done.
My papers are entirely out of order.

355
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.583
Your case. it's vexing you.

356
00:26:18.541 --> 00:26:21.708
Seems to be an awful lot of question marks
on that map of yours.

357
00:26:21.791 --> 00:26:23.708
Dundee cake. Door.

358
00:26:23.791 --> 00:26:26.125
-I will see you again.
-Is that why you're drinking?

359
00:26:26.208 --> 00:26:29.041
I'm more than certain…
…it's not so old.

360
00:26:29.125 --> 00:26:31.416
-Maybe I can help.
-You can help by leaving.

361
00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:35.958
Huh. Yes. The world
will be a much safer place

362
00:26:36.041 --> 00:26:39.208
if we don't see the inside
of Sherlock Holmes. only the out.

363
00:26:41.208 --> 00:26:42.083
Crazy idea.

364
00:26:43.125 --> 00:26:45.208
Have you ever considered a flatmate?

365
00:26:45.291 --> 00:26:48.041
-For what purpose?
-To stop you descending into this.

366
00:26:52.375 --> 00:26:53.250
Strange

367
00:26:54.083 --> 00:26:58.250
how those seeking advice
so often like to dispense it.

368
00:26:58.333 --> 00:27:01.041
Did I ask for advice?
I found you on the street. drunk.

369
00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:04.333
-Now what may I observe about you?
-We're not playing this game.

370
00:27:04.416 --> 00:27:05.916
Shoes a state. Hair's not much better.

371
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
-You and Mycroft are so similar.
-You need to wash your clothes.

372
00:27:09.125 --> 00:27:11.208
-Unwilling to look past--
-You are pale--

373
00:27:11.291 --> 00:27:14.208
-Stop!
-And then there's your fingernails.

374
00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.666
-Why are you working in a match factory?
-What?

375
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:21.416
Last night. they were dirty with green
traces. This morning. they are black.

376
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.041
The phosphorous from the match-making
has mixed with oxygen.

377
00:27:24.125 --> 00:27:27.041
I wasn't in such a state
as to not see that.

378
00:27:27.666 --> 00:27:29.583
-How did you--
-And your neck is red.

379
00:27:29.666 --> 00:27:31.541
Someone has gripped it
or held a knife against…

380
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.083
Are you involved in something dangerous?

381
00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:41.250
You are still my ward.

382
00:27:41.333 --> 00:27:44.041
If you need my help.
my offer remains on the table.

383
00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:48.125
Don't be so desperate
to prove yourself. Enola.

384
00:27:49.666 --> 00:27:54.083
I am not desperate.
and I don't need your or anyone's help.

385
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.625
But this I will have.

386
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.041
How dare he?
How dare he lecture me?

387
00:28:11.708 --> 00:28:13.416
When he can't even solve his own case

388
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.666
and he lives in a bed of flummoxing papers
and bewildering mold.

389
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:19.375
How dare he claim I'm desperate?
It is not true.

390
00:28:19.875 --> 00:28:21.750
-And this is not fair.
-Enola?

391
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.500
It is you.

392
00:28:29.375 --> 00:28:30.208
And it is you.

393
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:33.041
How are you?

394
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.333
Are you well? You look…

395
00:28:36.416 --> 00:28:40.708
I'm on a case. Undercover. Forget
I told you that piece of information.

396
00:28:40.791 --> 00:28:44.625
It's the strangest thing. I could have
sworn I've seen you here before.

397
00:28:46.166 --> 00:28:47.125
Is that right?

398
00:28:47.208 --> 00:28:50.250
Well. this is my…
My route through to the Lords.

399
00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:53.458
Is it? How lovely.

400
00:28:53.541 --> 00:28:56.083
Well. I… I breakfast here on occasion.

401
00:28:59.458 --> 00:29:03.750
I mean. yes. it's a lovely place.
I-I know the gardener here.

402
00:29:04.625 --> 00:29:07.000
We've been discussing
what to sow for next year's crop.

403
00:29:07.083 --> 00:29:08.416
Some fine sunflowers.

404
00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.375
Uh. Sweet Williams.
for their lovely vivid reds.

405
00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:13.000
I've seen all you're doing.

406
00:29:14.166 --> 00:29:16.625
Oh. Well. it's… It's nothing.

407
00:29:16.708 --> 00:29:18.041
In the society pages.

408
00:29:21.791 --> 00:29:23.625
You are quite the eligible bachelor.

409
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.125
Don't believe all you read.

410
00:29:33.208 --> 00:29:34.250
I wrote to you.

411
00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:37.250
You didn't reply.

412
00:29:37.875 --> 00:29:38.708
Uh…

413
00:29:39.666 --> 00:29:41.583
I… was busy.

414
00:29:42.083 --> 00:29:44.625
Starting my own business.
A perpetual challenge.

415
00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:46.833
Perhaps. not something you'd understand.

416
00:29:47.625 --> 00:29:50.041
-Well. Enola. if you need help--
-I do not.

417
00:29:51.583 --> 00:29:54.583
Should my problem become horticultural.
I shall seek you out.

418
00:29:56.166 --> 00:29:57.000
Right.

419
00:29:57.583 --> 00:30:00.250
Well. you know where to find me

420
00:30:02.166 --> 00:30:03.500
should a plant go missing.

421
00:30:04.041 --> 00:30:05.583
I hope you enjoy your breakfast.

422
00:30:09.916 --> 00:30:10.750
Yeah.

423
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.500
Is he looking back?

424
00:30:20.583 --> 00:30:22.458
Oh. Good. he isn't.

425
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.250
I don't come here every day.

426
00:30:27.166 --> 00:30:28.791
Just on days when I feel a need.

427
00:30:29.708 --> 00:30:33.833
And sometimes he doesn't take this path.
Sometimes he takes the parallel one.

428
00:30:36.916 --> 00:30:41.125
-You know where to find me.

429
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.500
"You know where to find me."

430
00:30:48.583 --> 00:30:50.125
"Out of sight"

431
00:30:50.208 --> 00:30:53.583
"The chapel awaits us
With its blossoms white"

432
00:30:54.166 --> 00:30:55.041
Whitechapel.

433
00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:57.666
"As we two ate of the fruit of love"

434
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.541
"As we two ate…"

435
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.916
"Two ate." Two-eight.

436
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.958
Twenty-eight.

437
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.458
"A bell did ring in the sky above"

438
00:31:06.541 --> 00:31:07.625
Bell?

439
00:31:07.708 --> 00:31:08.875
"So wander that place"

440
00:31:10.083 --> 00:31:12.166
Bell. Place. "Out of sight"

441
00:31:14.083 --> 00:31:17.083
28 Bell Place. Whitechapel!

442
00:31:17.166 --> 00:31:18.333
Shh!

443
00:31:18.416 --> 00:31:20.041
-Oh. sorry.

444
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.708
The game has found its feet again.

445
00:31:28.875 --> 00:31:30.125
I will not lie.

446
00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:33.041
There is a certain satisfaction
that you feel as a detective

447
00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:35.750
when your case comes closer to resolution.

448
00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:36.958
Like sewing a new skirt…

449
00:31:39.541 --> 00:31:42.416
…which I don't do.
or teaching a dog to sit.

450
00:31:43.416 --> 00:31:46.500
You begin to glow with the acknowledgement
of a job well done.

451
00:31:46.583 --> 00:31:48.500
There's a new Holmes in town.

452
00:31:48.583 --> 00:31:51.500
That's right. Sherlock Holmes
has met his match.

453
00:31:52.166 --> 00:31:55.541
My name will be known.
and Bessie will have a sister once again.

454
00:31:56.541 --> 00:31:58.083
And that is a job well…

455
00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:01.625
done.

456
00:32:26.208 --> 00:32:27.291
Sarah?

457
00:32:42.958 --> 00:32:44.541
What happened here?

458
00:32:54.958 --> 00:32:56.333
Mr. Poppy.

459
00:33:06.958 --> 00:33:08.916
-Oh. Mae.

460
00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:13.791
What happened? Who did this to you?

461
00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:17.750
-Was it him. Sarah's man? Mae!

462
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.708
No. no. It's all right.

463
00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:22.500
I'll fetch a doctor for you.

464
00:33:23.916 --> 00:33:25.541
No! No. no. no.

465
00:33:26.125 --> 00:33:26.958
No.

466
00:33:27.625 --> 00:33:28.458
Come back.

467
00:34:05.125 --> 00:34:05.958
Miss Holmes?

468
00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.750
-Inspector Lestrade.

469
00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:11.666
-Enola Holmes.
-Lestrade.

470
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.416
-She… She's--
-Dead.

471
00:34:14.958 --> 00:34:15.875
How'd that happen?

472
00:34:20.583 --> 00:34:24.333
Oh. no. no. no. I'm investigating a case.
A disappearance of a girl.

473
00:34:24.416 --> 00:34:27.458
-What. that girl?
-No. No. no. no. H-Her name is Mae.

474
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
She worked at the Paragon Theater.
the matchstick factory.

475
00:34:31.083 --> 00:34:34.458
-She was a dancer. She's friends--

476
00:34:48.791 --> 00:34:50.041
Superintendent Grail.

477
00:34:55.541 --> 00:34:57.958
-Good morning.
-Good morning. sir.

478
00:34:58.041 --> 00:35:00.541
I was sent to investigate
a possible disturbance.

479
00:35:00.625 --> 00:35:03.791
Someone heard some screams.
and then I discovered this young lady.

480
00:35:03.875 --> 00:35:04.916
Her name?

481
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.291
Enola Holmes.

482
00:35:07.833 --> 00:35:08.958
Uh. his sister.

483
00:35:09.666 --> 00:35:10.708
A detective too.

484
00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:13.875
Good God. another one.

485
00:35:13.958 --> 00:35:15.916
Shouldn't you be in finishing school?

486
00:35:16.708 --> 00:35:19.500
Investigating the disappearance of a…

487
00:35:19.583 --> 00:35:20.833
-Sarah Chapman.
-Yeah.

488
00:35:20.916 --> 00:35:24.458
Sarah Chapman?
Well. well. how intriguing. So am I.

489
00:35:24.541 --> 00:35:27.625
-She's wanted for theft and blackmail.
-Blackmail?

490
00:35:27.708 --> 00:35:29.375
Yes. detective.

491
00:35:31.583 --> 00:35:33.958
Still warm. No rigor mortis.

492
00:35:34.583 --> 00:35:37.666
-When were the screams heard. inspector?
-Ten past the hour. sir.

493
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.625
When did you arrive. detective?

494
00:35:41.166 --> 00:35:42.333
A-Around the same time.

495
00:35:45.625 --> 00:35:46.875
Even more intriguing.

496
00:35:46.958 --> 00:35:51.333
Uh. no. I was trying to suppress
the blood. I-I was trying to save her.

497
00:35:51.416 --> 00:35:53.666
Or trying to get information out of her.

498
00:35:55.375 --> 00:35:56.875
Give her a search. inspector.

499
00:35:56.958 --> 00:35:59.666
Oh. I couldn't. I can't pat her down. sir.

500
00:36:00.208 --> 00:36:03.625
Come along. Lestrade.
Let's not be coy about this.

501
00:36:03.708 --> 00:36:06.750
-She's a detective. She knows the rules.
-Yes.

502
00:36:09.375 --> 00:36:11.125
Um…

503
00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:12.416
Give me that bag!

504
00:36:21.666 --> 00:36:22.500
What's this?

505
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:24.750
My evidence.

506
00:36:26.291 --> 00:36:27.208
And that?

507
00:36:30.041 --> 00:36:31.208
It's nothing.

508
00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:32.750
Then why are you hiding it?

509
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:37.041
Found at a murder scene
with a freshly dead corpse.

510
00:36:37.125 --> 00:36:39.583
harboring evidence isn't gonna look good.

511
00:36:39.666 --> 00:36:41.875
Superintendent Grail. you can't believe--

512
00:36:41.958 --> 00:36:44.333
What can't I believe. missy?

513
00:36:44.875 --> 00:36:47.625
That young ladies
don't have the hands for killing?

514
00:36:47.708 --> 00:36:48.750
Now. give them here.

515
00:36:54.125 --> 00:36:55.541
-Oh!

516
00:37:05.916 --> 00:37:08.125
-Go on!
-After her. all of ya!

517
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.375
Why ever would she ever do that?

518
00:37:11.875 --> 00:37:14.708
-Get out of the way! Move!

519
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:16.708
-Stop that girl!

520
00:37:19.416 --> 00:37:20.625
You've seen this before.

521
00:37:25.041 --> 00:37:28.416
Ah. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
You remember me. I hope.

522
00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:35.958
We're looking for your sister.
She's caused a bit of trouble.

523
00:37:45.458 --> 00:37:46.416
May I?

524
00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:57.083
Is it. sir?

525
00:37:58.708 --> 00:37:59.875
Is it?

526
00:37:59.958 --> 00:38:02.125
Take it. I have others.

527
00:38:02.208 --> 00:38:03.958
Take it? I can't.

528
00:38:04.041 --> 00:38:05.083
I can.

529
00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:06.000
I can't.

530
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.000
Perhaps I can.

531
00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:17.750
And this. the famous fiddle?

532
00:38:19.375 --> 00:38:21.291
That I do not have two of.

533
00:38:22.458 --> 00:38:25.416
Perhaps you can explain
what you believe Enola has done.

534
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.416
I wish I was at liberty to say. sir.

535
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.083
Do you mind?

536
00:38:41.041 --> 00:38:43.041
Oh. your latest case.

537
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:45.041
What's it concerning?

538
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.708
Is it another Brixton Strangler?

539
00:38:48.458 --> 00:38:49.375
Or a Periwinkle?

540
00:38:50.791 --> 00:38:52.458
Don't tell me it's a Clerkenwell.

541
00:38:52.541 --> 00:38:54.416
What evidence do they have
against my sister?

542
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.166
Perhaps. uh. you tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine.

543
00:39:01.041 --> 00:39:02.750
Government case. some missing money.

544
00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:04.958
Now you.

545
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.416
Super wants to talk her.

546
00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:10.500
-Why?
-Just following orders. Mr. Holmes.

547
00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:12.166
Or may I call you Sherlock?

548
00:39:14.416 --> 00:39:17.000
Graydon. Graydon Lestrade.

549
00:39:17.083 --> 00:39:20.791
My father thought it distinguished.
and it is rather.

550
00:39:25.416 --> 00:39:28.708
Well. anyway. should you ever
wish to call me that…

551
00:39:30.208 --> 00:39:31.041
Right.

552
00:39:34.083 --> 00:39:34.958
As you were.

553
00:39:45.833 --> 00:39:47.041
Oh dear.

554
00:39:49.083 --> 00:39:50.875
Whoa!

555
00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:54.333
My mistake.
I should have warned you I was opening it.

556
00:39:57.416 --> 00:39:58.250
No.

557
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:04.916
Dare I ask?

558
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:12.875
Good afternoon.

559
00:40:13.375 --> 00:40:15.208
May I ask a favor?

560
00:40:20.625 --> 00:40:23.333
Never mind. Tell me everything.

561
00:40:24.166 --> 00:40:25.708
-A government case?
-No.

562
00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:28.916
Is it
another Brixton Strangler?

563
00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:32.125
Or… Or a Periwinkle?

564
00:40:32.708 --> 00:40:34.875
"You tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine."

565
00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:38.500
He's a ninny. I needed to know
what he had on you.

566
00:40:43.041 --> 00:40:46.083
Money. Unaccounted transfers
going in and out of government offices.

567
00:40:46.833 --> 00:40:49.458
My theory is either bribery.
extortion. or blackmail.

568
00:40:49.541 --> 00:40:50.875
And what have you found?

569
00:40:52.666 --> 00:40:54.750
Separate filings
from five different accounts

570
00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:58.041
going via the Treasury
into one private bank.

571
00:40:58.125 --> 00:41:00.791
-So someone is getting rich from this?
-Yes.

572
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.041
-Who?
-No name.

573
00:41:04.125 --> 00:41:05.541
Just a number.

574
00:41:05.625 --> 00:41:08.583
I visited the bank and inquired.
The money disappeared.

575
00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:10.833
arriving at another bank.
and then another.

576
00:41:10.916 --> 00:41:13.083
and another. and another.
and another. and another.

577
00:41:13.166 --> 00:41:16.833
Every one of them hidden
using different account numbers.

578
00:41:16.916 --> 00:41:18.083
Twenty-seven in total.

579
00:41:18.166 --> 00:41:21.583
-Well. what can you deduce from that?
-Three things.

580
00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:25.916
Firstly. the man's a game player.
perhaps a genius in mathematics.

581
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.083
capable of covering his traces
at every turn.

582
00:41:28.166 --> 00:41:30.541
Secondly. the sources are varied.

583
00:41:30.625 --> 00:41:33.958
Five banks. south of the river.
but no clear link between them.

584
00:41:34.541 --> 00:41:35.875
All anonymous.

585
00:41:35.958 --> 00:41:39.125
All going into one pocket.

586
00:41:40.541 --> 00:41:41.541
And the third?

587
00:41:44.791 --> 00:41:45.875
He knows I'm onto him.

588
00:41:47.416 --> 00:41:48.250
What? How?

589
00:41:48.333 --> 00:41:51.833
Every time I pull a thread.
it loosens. vanishes.

590
00:41:51.916 --> 00:41:54.625
reappears somewhere else.
He's leading me a merry dance.

591
00:41:54.708 --> 00:41:55.541
It's…

592
00:41:57.958 --> 00:41:58.916
It's infuriating.

593
00:42:00.083 --> 00:42:02.083
So no leads whatsoever?

594
00:42:02.666 --> 00:42:04.416
One. A week before the first transfer.

595
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.166
there was a break-in
at the Treasury office

596
00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.708
by a man in a taper crown hat.

597
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:08.916
A taper crown hat.

598
00:42:09.583 --> 00:42:10.875
-What was taken?
-A document.

599
00:42:10.958 --> 00:42:13.666
They won't talk about it.
Sensitive information presumably.

600
00:42:14.166 --> 00:42:18.000
But how it connects to all of this
has so far eluded me.

601
00:42:18.541 --> 00:42:21.000
Your turn. I hope the blood's not yours.

602
00:42:22.333 --> 00:42:24.500
I'm looking for a girl. Sarah Chapman.

603
00:42:24.583 --> 00:42:27.041
Her sister employed me. Bessie.

604
00:42:28.125 --> 00:42:31.458
She worked at Lyons match factory by day.
and the music hall at night.

605
00:42:32.375 --> 00:42:33.250
She has a lover.

606
00:42:34.541 --> 00:42:36.291
whose flat I visited.

607
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:39.041
He'd given her this.

608
00:42:42.458 --> 00:42:43.666
28 Bell Place?

609
00:42:45.083 --> 00:42:46.458
Whitechapel. yes.

610
00:42:46.541 --> 00:42:48.791
And there I found her friend.

611
00:42:50.083 --> 00:42:50.916
murdered.

612
00:42:55.208 --> 00:42:57.541
And who killed her? This poppy fellow?

613
00:43:01.666 --> 00:43:03.041
I suspect so.

614
00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:05.791
Perhaps he kidnapped Sarah
and her friend discovered it.

615
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:08.041
Love.

616
00:43:09.041 --> 00:43:10.250
What it does to people.

617
00:43:12.791 --> 00:43:14.333
-How was she killed?
-A kitchen knife.

618
00:43:14.416 --> 00:43:15.875
-Did you touch this weapon?
-No.

619
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:18.833
Then why did you run?

620
00:43:18.916 --> 00:43:20.500
I found more evidence on her.

621
00:43:20.583 --> 00:43:22.416
This policeman wanted it.

622
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.333
-He has this walk.
-Grail.

623
00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:27.250
We have a history.

624
00:43:28.875 --> 00:43:30.375
This was in her pocket.

625
00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:52.250
It's as bad as the poem.

626
00:43:54.041 --> 00:43:55.625
-Leave it with me.
-No.

627
00:43:56.125 --> 00:43:58.333
It's mine. and it's important.

628
00:43:59.666 --> 00:44:03.041
Grail said she had stolen something
and that she was blackmailing them.

629
00:44:03.666 --> 00:44:06.916
-Though Sarah wouldn't do that.
-You don't know this person.

630
00:44:08.083 --> 00:44:08.916
I feel I do.

631
00:44:09.916 --> 00:44:11.958
You came here running from the police.

632
00:44:12.041 --> 00:44:13.791
Someone is already dead.

633
00:44:13.875 --> 00:44:16.125
and you are now a suspect
in a murder case.

634
00:44:16.208 --> 00:44:18.166
You've let your emotions
get the better of you.

635
00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:21.583
Stay here. Don't leave.
I will look into this.

636
00:44:21.666 --> 00:44:25.541
But Sarah Chapman is my responsibility.
No one else cares for these girls.

637
00:44:26.125 --> 00:44:27.666
I promised her sister.

638
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.541
The first mistake a detective makes

639
00:44:29.625 --> 00:44:33.250
is to make it about themselves
and not the case.

640
00:44:40.291 --> 00:44:43.416
Enola. I know you're not a fan
of unnecessary advice.

641
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.875
but please…

642
00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:49.125
…don't turn into me.

643
00:44:53.875 --> 00:44:55.583
I should probably write that down.

644
00:44:56.916 --> 00:44:59.750
Matches. matches!
Come buy your matches!

645
00:44:59.833 --> 00:45:01.083
Only a penny a box.

646
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:05.375
Matches. matches! Only a penny a box.

647
00:45:05.458 --> 00:45:06.916
Come buy your matches!

648
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.041
Posh girls like you
don't belong in this fight.

649
00:45:09.125 --> 00:45:11.125
We don't need help from people like you.

650
00:45:13.208 --> 00:45:17.791
See. they all think there's hope.
That love is coming their way.

651
00:45:17.875 --> 00:45:19.125
But it never is.

652
00:45:20.291 --> 00:45:22.375
Gents like that. they want cheap.

653
00:45:22.458 --> 00:45:23.958
but they marry dear.

654
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.583
So. Poppy. you're a gent. are you?

655
00:45:30.166 --> 00:45:33.333
And a well-heeled one
to afford a love nest like that.

656
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:37.500
-Sir--
-Don't be ridiculous.

657
00:46:23.333 --> 00:46:26.291
There was a break-in
at the Treasury office

658
00:46:26.375 --> 00:46:27.875
by a man in a taper crown hat.

659
00:46:33.166 --> 00:46:36.625
Five banks. south of the river.
but no clear link between them.

660
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.750
"Match makers ball."

661
00:46:44.583 --> 00:46:48.625
"Hosted by Henry and Hilda Lyon.
12 Marchmont Square."

662
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:51.958
Does that date mean anything to you?

663
00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.583
It's not a date at all.

664
00:46:57.958 --> 00:47:01.166
"Their eldest son. William Lyon.
will be leading the first…"

665
00:47:02.125 --> 00:47:04.541
Sweet Williams.
for their wonderfully vivid reds.

666
00:47:05.125 --> 00:47:08.375
Our ladies are working at the highest
level of production and efficiency.

667
00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:10.250
-Are they not. William?
-Yes. Father.

668
00:47:10.333 --> 00:47:13.833
And all along. I thought you were a poppy.

669
00:47:16.541 --> 00:47:19.666
Let's see how sweet you are.
Sweet William.

670
00:47:22.916 --> 00:47:23.916
I'm going to a ball.

671
00:47:26.958 --> 00:47:27.833
Ugh.

672
00:47:49.291 --> 00:47:50.125
'Tis I.

673
00:47:51.958 --> 00:47:53.250
'Tis not I.

674
00:47:54.083 --> 00:47:56.833
Which. when you're wanted
by the police. is most useful.

675
00:47:57.458 --> 00:48:00.875
Pray silence
for his Lordship Viscount McIntyre.

676
00:48:00.958 --> 00:48:03.541
I-I'm sorry to break apart
this glorious occasion.

677
00:48:03.625 --> 00:48:05.250
but. well. I'm a politician.

678
00:48:05.333 --> 00:48:08.291
Any chance to stand on a stage.
I'll always take it.

679
00:48:09.458 --> 00:48:12.916
And I must speak
to thank our host

680
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.958
and applaud his achievements.

681
00:48:17.166 --> 00:48:18.625
No masks. no matter.

682
00:48:18.708 --> 00:48:22.416
For Henry Lyon
turns all before him into gold.

683
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.583
Ha. nonsense! Pewter at best.

684
00:48:25.666 --> 00:48:28.041
What he has done with matches
is legendary.

685
00:48:28.541 --> 00:48:31.458
In two years. he's turned red into black.

686
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:32.916
Or should I say.

687
00:48:33.875 --> 00:48:36.208
red into white?

688
00:48:36.291 --> 00:48:38.541
And to have this humble man
turn his attention

689
00:48:38.625 --> 00:48:40.666
to typhoid and the working poor.

690
00:48:41.333 --> 00:48:44.166
raising funds.
diagnosing cases in the community.

691
00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:46.416
I'm overwhelmed. I'm simply overwhelmed.

692
00:48:46.916 --> 00:48:51.041
Ladies and gentlemen.
I give you Henry Lyon.

693
00:48:51.125 --> 00:48:56.000
And to his fine son. his heir. William.

694
00:48:58.458 --> 00:48:59.541
To the future.

695
00:49:00.333 --> 00:49:04.291
-To the future.
-May it ever be bright.

696
00:49:06.208 --> 00:49:08.041
Right. Henry. light us up.

697
00:49:09.625 --> 00:49:10.458
Gladly.

698
00:49:15.291 --> 00:49:17.250
Now go and enjoy yourselves.

699
00:49:23.833 --> 00:49:25.916
I believe I've seen that dress
somewhere before.

700
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.083
-Oh yes. last year.

701
00:49:30.416 --> 00:49:32.333
I think it's charming. elegant.

702
00:49:32.958 --> 00:49:34.208
I think you are kind.

703
00:49:48.583 --> 00:49:49.666
Gentlemen.

704
00:49:50.541 --> 00:49:51.375
Ma'am.

705
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:53.083
Good evening.

706
00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.750
This is a wonderful occasion. is it not?

707
00:50:02.125 --> 00:50:07.041
I mean. the guests are just… delightful.

708
00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:11.791
And the orchestra is most tuneful.

709
00:50:16.083 --> 00:50:18.125
I was wondering if

710
00:50:19.291 --> 00:50:21.666
I might be able to speak to you. Mr. Lyon.

711
00:50:24.583 --> 00:50:27.500
-Uh. have I said something wrong?
-Where is your chaperone?

712
00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.291
Chaperone?

713
00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:33.708
My dear. you can hardly expect my son
to talk to you unaccompanied.

714
00:50:36.541 --> 00:50:38.083
-Oh.

715
00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:47.208
I cannot talk to you without a chaperone?

716
00:50:47.291 --> 00:50:48.833
No. of course not.

717
00:50:48.916 --> 00:50:49.875
Honestly?

718
00:50:52.208 --> 00:50:53.083
Honestly?

719
00:50:54.083 --> 00:50:55.375
Who is this woman?

720
00:50:55.458 --> 00:50:57.125
Well. they are talking.

721
00:50:57.208 --> 00:50:58.458
They are dancing.

722
00:50:59.166 --> 00:51:00.875
Good evening. my dear.

723
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Yes.

724
00:51:03.083 --> 00:51:04.375
How foolish of me.

725
00:51:06.125 --> 00:51:06.958
Good evening.

726
00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:25.875
It could be claimed.
with some justification.

727
00:51:25.958 --> 00:51:27.750
that I might have prepared
more thoroughly.

728
00:51:27.833 --> 00:51:30.000
But dancing is not
one of my core strengths.

729
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.291
Well. except…

730
00:51:32.375 --> 00:51:36.125
♪ Knees up Mother Brown
Under the table you must go ♪

731
00:51:36.208 --> 00:51:37.708
♪ Ee-aye. ee-aye. oh! ♪

732
00:51:39.208 --> 00:51:40.750
You see my situation.

733
00:51:51.958 --> 00:51:53.125
Who are you?

734
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.375
The man's a game player.

735
00:51:57.458 --> 00:51:59.500
Separate filings
from five different accounts.

736
00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:02.708
Capable of covering his traces
at every turn. One private bank.

737
00:52:02.791 --> 00:52:06.166
Vanishes and reappears.
No name. Just a number.

738
00:52:13.708 --> 00:52:15.666
Perhaps
a genius in mathematics.

739
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:19.083
Leading me a merry dance.

740
00:52:19.666 --> 00:52:20.541
It's a cipher.

741
00:52:26.375 --> 00:52:27.208
The polka.

742
00:52:28.708 --> 00:52:31.291
The promenade. The two-step.

743
00:52:32.208 --> 00:52:33.708
They're all dances.

744
00:52:33.791 --> 00:52:35.416
Dance. dance. dance. dance.

745
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.875
Twenty-seven. turn on…

746
00:52:42.375 --> 00:52:44.416
Yes. The Language of the Dance.

747
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.458
"Twenty-seven dances."

748
00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:48.125
I've got you.

749
00:52:48.208 --> 00:52:51.166
Dance one. then 14. 22.

750
00:52:55.916 --> 00:52:58.625
Terrible. aren't they? These things.

751
00:52:59.583 --> 00:53:01.583
All pompidou and popinjay.

752
00:53:02.291 --> 00:53:03.750
Have we met somewhere before?

753
00:53:04.875 --> 00:53:08.166
I feel I recognize you from somewhere.

754
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:11.416
I simply have one of those faces.

755
00:53:13.875 --> 00:53:14.708
Mira Troy.

756
00:53:15.375 --> 00:53:17.291
private secretary to Lord McIntyre.

757
00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:19.333
Treasury Minister.

758
00:53:20.541 --> 00:53:21.375
Tabitha.

759
00:53:22.708 --> 00:53:24.250
Tabitha Timothy.

760
00:53:27.333 --> 00:53:29.166
You mustn't let them concern you.

761
00:53:29.791 --> 00:53:31.250
It's just a performance.

762
00:53:32.083 --> 00:53:34.375
Everyone here is playing a part.

763
00:53:35.166 --> 00:53:36.166
Testing each other.

764
00:53:38.916 --> 00:53:39.750
Winning.

765
00:53:41.375 --> 00:53:42.208
Losing.

766
00:53:43.541 --> 00:53:44.750
And it's fun.

767
00:53:45.708 --> 00:53:47.125
once you know the rules.

768
00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.500
What are they doing with those fans?

769
00:53:58.166 --> 00:53:59.666
Sending messages.

770
00:54:00.166 --> 00:54:03.416
Saying everything that is forbidden.

771
00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:08.541
or too embarrassing to say aloud.

772
00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:15.041
Thank you for the lesson.

773
00:54:16.708 --> 00:54:18.208
It's a lesson hard learned.

774
00:54:20.625 --> 00:54:24.166
Without power. we women
must rely on our wits for our fortune.

775
00:54:24.791 --> 00:54:27.375
because our chances are short. Here.

776
00:54:28.083 --> 00:54:28.916
Take my fan.

777
00:54:30.291 --> 00:54:31.583
I have no use for it.

778
00:54:33.083 --> 00:54:35.958
And if you wish to speak to William.

779
00:54:37.958 --> 00:54:39.541
you could always try with that.

780
00:54:57.166 --> 00:54:58.583
No. not… No. not you. Oh.

781
00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:02.416
Help.

782
00:55:05.083 --> 00:55:06.458
It would be my delight.

783
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:12.791
Really. there's no need to be rude.

784
00:55:12.875 --> 00:55:14.291
I-I didn't mean to.

785
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.291
Tewkesbury!

786
00:55:31.375 --> 00:55:33.791
-Your timing's impeccable!
-Enola?

787
00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:36.791
Don't speak to me here. otherwise
you'll be thrown onto the street.

788
00:55:41.041 --> 00:55:44.125
-I need you to teach me to dance.
-Teach you to dance? When?

789
00:55:44.208 --> 00:55:46.250
-Teach me to dance now.
-Wh…

790
00:55:46.333 --> 00:55:48.541
You understand
I've been learning since I was five?

791
00:55:48.625 --> 00:55:51.625
Good. I'd feared
you'd be a terrible teacher.

792
00:55:51.708 --> 00:55:54.375
-What are you doing here?
-I'm looking for a murderer.

793
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.416
Though I shouldn't have told you.
Forget I told you that.

794
00:55:57.916 --> 00:56:01.916
-I'm trying to save a girl's life.
-Through dance?

795
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.250
Please. Tewkesbury.

796
00:56:06.458 --> 00:56:09.083
All right. Hold your back straight.

797
00:56:11.083 --> 00:56:14.125
And I'll place my hand here and here.

798
00:56:14.208 --> 00:56:15.583
Oh. Yes.

799
00:56:16.916 --> 00:56:17.791
Hold your arm out.

800
00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:20.208
Good.

801
00:56:20.875 --> 00:56:22.958
Now. I will lead and you will follow.

802
00:56:23.041 --> 00:56:25.541
-That seems like a mistake.
-Face over my shoulder.

803
00:56:27.458 --> 00:56:30.500
And now. one. two. three.

804
00:56:31.041 --> 00:56:33.166
Two. three. Two. three.

805
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:36.208
Four. two. three. One. two. three.

806
00:56:36.708 --> 00:56:37.541
Two. three.

807
00:56:38.875 --> 00:56:39.750
Good.

808
00:56:46.208 --> 00:56:48.333
You seem different since last we spoke.

809
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:51.166
Tell me why you've been
coming to the park.

810
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:53.291
Why… Why watch me walk to the Lords?

811
00:56:54.125 --> 00:56:55.541
Simply keeping an eye on you.

812
00:56:56.041 --> 00:56:58.083
in case you get yourself
into any more scrapes.

813
00:56:58.166 --> 00:57:00.625
-Getting thrown out of trains.
-Enola--

814
00:57:00.708 --> 00:57:02.875
You cannot be trusted
to take care of yourself.

815
00:57:03.583 --> 00:57:04.458
I'm a man now.

816
00:57:04.541 --> 00:57:06.250
You're a man when I tell you you're a man.

817
00:57:06.333 --> 00:57:09.333
And the scrapes I find myself in
are far less visceral.

818
00:57:13.125 --> 00:57:14.125
Now. come on.

819
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:18.708
Two. three. Two. three.

820
00:57:18.791 --> 00:57:19.916
Look into my eyes.

821
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:22.625
The rhythm is always there.

822
00:57:23.583 --> 00:57:25.541
Dancing is a trust. it's a union.

823
00:57:25.625 --> 00:57:27.250
That's why I've always loved it.

824
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:29.958
even when I was being tutored by my uncle.

825
00:57:30.041 --> 00:57:31.750
That man likes a pork mustard pie.

826
00:57:32.625 --> 00:57:33.541
His breath…

827
00:57:34.166 --> 00:57:35.125
Turn. two.

828
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:37.833
Turn. Feel it?

829
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:39.583
I can feel it.

830
00:57:48.375 --> 00:57:49.250
Good.

831
00:57:50.416 --> 00:57:52.583
-You dance well.
-Perhaps I have a fine teacher.

832
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.875
Though his breath has less mustard
on it than I'd hoped.

833
00:58:18.291 --> 00:58:21.041
-We have an urgent situation.

834
00:58:21.125 --> 00:58:21.958
I should go.

835
00:58:22.833 --> 00:58:24.083
You'll need a dance card.

836
00:58:25.416 --> 00:58:26.875
But I don't know enough.

837
00:58:30.041 --> 00:58:31.791
-What does that mean?
-You'll learn.

838
00:58:36.458 --> 00:58:39.416
Don't touch the ginger cake.
Plays hopscotch with your bowels.

839
00:58:51.791 --> 00:58:52.625
Oh.

840
00:58:53.666 --> 00:58:54.583
Hello.

841
00:58:59.833 --> 00:59:02.416
-Mr. Lyon.
-Yes.

842
00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.000
I was wondering
if we might have a dance this evening.

843
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.166
My dance card is full.

844
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:08.291
May I see it?

845
00:59:16.333 --> 00:59:18.000
Your last waltz is still free.

846
00:59:18.666 --> 00:59:19.791
How fitting.

847
00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:22.875
Would you mind?

848
00:59:34.583 --> 00:59:35.416
Until then.

849
00:59:55.166 --> 00:59:56.083
'Tis he.

850
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.625
You admire Lord Tewkesbury?

851
01:00:06.291 --> 01:00:07.291
No!

852
01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:09.583
No.

853
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:12.416
We are old friends.

854
01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:15.708
I hear he's a good man.
and a great reformer.

855
01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.333
Hm.

856
01:00:18.166 --> 01:00:21.041
Well. if you wish to dance with him.
you may have to wait.

857
01:00:21.125 --> 01:00:22.250
There's quite a queue.

858
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:27.125
Yes. I mustn't lose my chance.

859
01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.208
Good evening. Miss…?

860
01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:32.208
Tabitha.

861
01:00:33.041 --> 01:00:33.875
Cicely.

862
01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:43.791
Forgive me for interrupting.
My name is Cicely.

863
01:00:43.875 --> 01:00:47.208
Um. your friend Tabitha
suggested we might dance.

864
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:49.166
Did she?

865
01:00:56.416 --> 01:01:01.000
Ladies and gentlemen. please
take your partners for the last waltz.

866
01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:29.916
You know. I swear I know your face.

867
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.333
What must it be?

868
01:01:31.916 --> 01:01:33.375
We have never met before.

869
01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:36.208
but I've seen you looking. Why?

870
01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:42.500
Of course. The Paragon Music Hall.

871
01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:45.666
I saw you talking
with a young woman there.

872
01:01:46.333 --> 01:01:47.666
Sarah Chapman.

873
01:01:49.541 --> 01:01:52.000
Dislocate from me and I will scream.

874
01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:55.666
The police are onto you. Mr. Lyon.
As it happens. they are onto us both.

875
01:01:57.875 --> 01:01:59.958
You were not invited here.
What do you want?

876
01:02:00.041 --> 01:02:03.625
I'm a private detective.
hired by Sarah's sister to find her.

877
01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:05.500
Bessie hired you?

878
01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:06.666
You know Bessie?

879
01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.125
Leave me be. please.

880
01:02:11.041 --> 01:02:12.500
or you will ruin everything.

881
01:02:13.125 --> 01:02:16.000
-How? What will I ruin?
-They're watching.

882
01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:21.000
If you must persist with this.
meet me in the library at midnight.

883
01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:23.333
Say nothing more now.

884
01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:26.041
Midnight it is.

885
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:56.791
"Moriarty."

886
01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:00.208
Who are you?

887
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.958
-My word. you do get in awkward places.
-Why are you holding a poker?

888
01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:17.208
You must leave. I'm waiting for another.

889
01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:19.416
Another you're scared of
such that you need a weapon?

890
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.750
You are always here
when I don't want you to be.

891
01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:23.416
And sometimes here when you do.

892
01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:26.500
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing that need concern you.

893
01:03:28.166 --> 01:03:32.166
I like the look of the one you were
dancing with. What's her name. Cicely?

894
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:33.958
She would make you an excellent wife.

895
01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:36.291
Enola. I am concerned only for you.

896
01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:39.333
Tewkesbury. if you're still here.
you may scare him away.

897
01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:42.375
-"Scare him"? All of this is over a man?

898
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.250
Just leave.

899
01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:56.791
Lord Tewkesbury.

900
01:04:00.458 --> 01:04:02.416
Enola Holmes. you're under arrest.

901
01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.958
Try to escape.
and we will make this difficult.

902
01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:08.416
Let's make it quiet and spare
the fine people any embarrassment.

903
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.625
-Sir. whatever this is about. I'm sure--
-Murder. sir.

904
01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:14.708
It's about murder.

905
01:04:17.916 --> 01:04:19.500
Tewkesbury. it's all right.

906
01:04:20.375 --> 01:04:21.666
Constable. go on.

907
01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:24.375
Keep them safe.

908
01:04:25.875 --> 01:04:27.916
-Please.
-Come along.

909
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:32.833
Ow.

910
01:04:35.541 --> 01:04:37.666
-Oh. I say.
-I knew she didn't belong here.

911
01:04:45.958 --> 01:04:47.875
-Despicable.
-Disgraceful.

912
01:04:57.791 --> 01:04:59.041
Quite a party.

913
01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:03.541
You danced with young Master Lyon. I hear.

914
01:05:04.916 --> 01:05:08.166
May I ask. impertinently. I'm sure.

915
01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:09.708
did you want to kiss him.

916
01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:12.541
or find out more about your case.

917
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:14.666
this Sarah Chapman?

918
01:05:19.625 --> 01:05:23.541
Look. if you're trying to protect her.

919
01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:25.333
know this.

920
01:05:26.291 --> 01:05:28.750
I will protect her better.

921
01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:32.000
There's someone wants to talk to her.

922
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:34.625
and they're not as kind as me.

923
01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:36.083
"Someone"?

924
01:05:39.125 --> 01:05:39.958
Who?

925
01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:44.750
Why were you following me that night?

926
01:05:47.916 --> 01:05:50.416
You were following Mae too. weren't you?

927
01:05:51.416 --> 01:05:52.958
That's why you found the flat.

928
01:05:57.416 --> 01:05:58.291
Nice shirt.

929
01:05:59.333 --> 01:06:00.166
Silk?

930
01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:02.375
On a policeman's salary?

931
01:06:04.583 --> 01:06:07.541
Who's paying you. Superintendent Grail?

932
01:06:07.625 --> 01:06:10.000
Who's paying you to kill match girls?

933
01:06:10.083 --> 01:06:11.916
Where's Sarah Chapman?

934
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.416
-I don't know.
-She's a thief and a troublemaker.

935
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.875
You don't want to risk your skin for her.

936
01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:23.125
Well. if I can't find it out from you.
I'll find it out from someone else.

937
01:06:23.208 --> 01:06:26.041
like her sister. little Bessie.

938
01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:28.541
She's just a little girl.

939
01:06:28.625 --> 01:06:31.291
Oh. but that's how it starts.
Enola Holmes!

940
01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:35.708
With little girls like her.
and you. and Sarah Chapman.

941
01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:38.583
asking questions.
doubting those in charge.

942
01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:40.958
not seeing their protection
for what it is.

943
01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:42.583
trying to tear it down.

944
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:47.041
Well. it only takes one little flame
to start a fire.

945
01:06:47.125 --> 01:06:50.083
and my job is to keep
crushing those bloody flames out.

946
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.166
Now. I'll be kind

947
01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:57.500
and give you one last chance.

948
01:06:59.833 --> 01:07:00.708
Where is she?

949
01:07:02.333 --> 01:07:03.208
I don't know.

950
01:07:10.916 --> 01:07:12.375
Then you're for the noose.

951
01:07:12.958 --> 01:07:14.458
Some detective you were.

952
01:07:16.041 --> 01:07:17.791
Should have stuck to needlework.

953
01:07:31.541 --> 01:07:32.666
Sir?

954
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:34.041
-Sir.
-Don't be ridi--

955
01:07:37.833 --> 01:07:39.166
Superintendent Grail.

956
01:07:40.666 --> 01:07:42.166
Mr. Holmes.

957
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.333
I'm here for my sister.

958
01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:47.708
If you can arrange her release.

959
01:07:49.416 --> 01:07:50.583
I'd much appreciate it.

960
01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:54.041
She is my ward and a minor.

961
01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:55.791
And a murderer.

962
01:07:55.875 --> 01:07:58.208
Any evidence you think
you have against her--

963
01:07:58.291 --> 01:07:59.541
I have plenty.

964
01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:04.375
She was seen arguing with the victim.
following the victim.

965
01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:08.166
fighting with the victim. and lastly.
standing over the victim's dead body.

966
01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:11.041
And when we find her there.
with blood on her hands.

967
01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:12.541
she bloody runs.

968
01:08:15.416 --> 01:08:16.583
I saw your murder site.

969
01:08:20.791 --> 01:08:24.416
Marks on and around the door
show that it was forced open.

970
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.791
and recently.

971
01:08:25.875 --> 01:08:27.208
There were signs of a scuffle

972
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:30.291
and boot marks
from three separate intruders.

973
01:08:30.375 --> 01:08:31.833
One of them heavyset.

974
01:08:32.625 --> 01:08:35.416
judging by the height and extent
of the subsequent damage.

975
01:08:36.416 --> 01:08:38.833
Traces of fabric and spots of blood

976
01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:42.750
suggests that there was
another occupant. likely female.

977
01:08:42.833 --> 01:08:44.500
who seems to have fought back.

978
01:08:44.583 --> 01:08:47.583
using a sharp and improvised weapon…

979
01:08:50.916 --> 01:08:52.791
before escaping through the window.

980
01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:55.125
This was a targeted
search and interrogation

981
01:08:55.208 --> 01:08:57.291
in which two women were discovered.

982
01:08:57.375 --> 01:08:59.416
and then my sister arrived.

983
01:09:00.375 --> 01:09:03.041
and you were curiously fast
to arrive after her.

984
01:09:03.625 --> 01:09:06.250
Now. are you going to release her.
or shall I?

985
01:09:09.333 --> 01:09:12.416
-Sergeant Beeston. if you please.
-Sir.

986
01:09:13.875 --> 01:09:15.375
Fingerprint matching.

987
01:09:15.458 --> 01:09:17.375
New invention. Swiss.

988
01:09:17.458 --> 01:09:20.166
-You have heard of it?
-I have.

989
01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:22.041
Would you care to look?

990
01:09:24.791 --> 01:09:27.083
Makes our work so much more efficient.

991
01:09:28.125 --> 01:09:29.916
especially in a murder case.

992
01:09:36.333 --> 01:09:38.166
My sister never touched that weapon.

993
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.125
Then why are her prints on it?

994
01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:49.750
It's a great age we live in.
isn't it. Mr. Holmes?

995
01:10:13.041 --> 01:10:15.250
Have you any sense
what time it is?

996
01:10:16.333 --> 01:10:19.583
-Hello. Edith.
-You're lucky. I almost broke your legs.

997
01:10:20.375 --> 01:10:22.083
Then I recognized the shoulders.

998
01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:25.916
-You have very recognizable shoulders.
-Enola's been arrested.

999
01:10:27.416 --> 01:10:28.458
For why?

1000
01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:30.208
Murder.

1001
01:10:32.875 --> 01:10:34.833
What she's got tangled with.

1002
01:10:35.416 --> 01:10:37.333
it may go wider than I thought.

1003
01:10:39.666 --> 01:10:41.791
And there's something
about this case that…

1004
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:45.750
Deduction alone will not solve?

1005
01:10:47.875 --> 01:10:50.000
I may need your…

1006
01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:54.375
I need your help.

1007
01:10:56.541 --> 01:10:58.291
We need your help.

1008
01:10:58.833 --> 01:11:01.416
Exercise for 15 minutes.

1009
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:04.083
Well. like my mother always said.

1010
01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:06.500
"Those who can turn to others
when they're in need

1011
01:11:06.583 --> 01:11:08.500
are the truly brave amongst us."

1012
01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:11.458
Your mother sounds very different to mine.

1013
01:11:22.666 --> 01:11:24.125
I did try to stop her.

1014
01:11:24.208 --> 01:11:27.541
but she's full of this fight.

1015
01:11:30.583 --> 01:11:32.166
There we go. Finally.

1016
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:34.625
You can't control Enola Holmes.

1017
01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:37.041
She's a force of nature.

1018
01:11:37.791 --> 01:11:38.916
a law unto herself.

1019
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.541
Go easy on her. girls.

1020
01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:43.958
Yes. she is.

1021
01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:47.375
And I fear she will hang.

1022
01:12:04.833 --> 01:12:05.666
Hm?

1023
01:12:19.458 --> 01:12:20.458
Come on. girls!

1024
01:12:22.833 --> 01:12:23.666
In there.

1025
01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:26.625
'Tis I.

1026
01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:30.958
-Yah!

1027
01:12:32.541 --> 01:12:33.750
Oh. it is good to see you.

1028
01:12:34.666 --> 01:12:35.875
-Yah!

1029
01:12:35.958 --> 01:12:37.041
Hang on!

1030
01:12:41.166 --> 01:12:42.083
Yah!

1031
01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:46.000
They're onto us!

1032
01:12:47.083 --> 01:12:49.125
-Yah!
-Be ready in there!

1033
01:12:51.125 --> 01:12:53.208
So this case of yours. how's it going?

1034
01:12:53.291 --> 01:12:54.166
I don't know.

1035
01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:57.375
I was trying to help a girl find
her sister. and I've made things worse.

1036
01:12:57.458 --> 01:12:58.416
Nonsense.

1037
01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.208
You stirred up a hornet's nest.
You are onto something.

1038
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.333
-Standby!
-Why else would they try and silence you?

1039
01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:09.375
Don't worry. it's completely harmless.

1040
01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.000
-On your left!
-My left or yours?

1041
01:13:14.833 --> 01:13:15.916
Yours!

1042
01:13:33.083 --> 01:13:35.500
This match factory.
what do you know about it?

1043
01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:36.958
It's a roaring success.

1044
01:13:37.041 --> 01:13:39.166
In two years. it's doubled its profits.

1045
01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:41.416
-And now there's typhus.
-Typhus?

1046
01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.125
Yes. the girls are going down with it.
They're dying.

1047
01:13:45.416 --> 01:13:46.416
That's a loose thread.

1048
01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.125
-What?
-They're back!

1049
01:13:48.833 --> 01:13:49.750
Yah!

1050
01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:53.416
Here they come! Brace yourselves!

1051
01:14:01.458 --> 01:14:03.208
We know about these factories.

1052
01:14:03.291 --> 01:14:04.750
Come on. come on!

1053
01:14:04.833 --> 01:14:06.958
Girls like Sarah Chapman.
they're expendable.

1054
01:14:07.041 --> 01:14:09.750
They go missing.
too often they die. no one cares.

1055
01:14:09.833 --> 01:14:12.791
But this girl. they care about.
And greatly.

1056
01:14:12.875 --> 01:14:14.291
So. what does she know?

1057
01:14:14.375 --> 01:14:16.375
-Get up here now!

1058
01:14:16.458 --> 01:14:18.458
She stole something. Some papers.

1059
01:14:18.541 --> 01:14:22.708
Aha! So what's she gonna do with them?
What's her plan? She's not a thief.

1060
01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:26.291
She's not a blackmailer.
She is a troublemaker.

1061
01:14:26.375 --> 01:14:28.250
She knows something.

1062
01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:30.875
and that is infinitely more dangerous.

1063
01:14:31.375 --> 01:14:32.375
Come on. lads!

1064
01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:41.791
-Stand by to the right!
-Would you mind?

1065
01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:43.500
-Wait for it.
-W-W-Where?

1066
01:14:43.583 --> 01:14:45.333
-Wait for it!
-Straight.

1067
01:14:46.041 --> 01:14:47.000
Now!

1068
01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:50.250
Get it out!
Get it out of here!

1069
01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.500
Now. whatever Sarah's hiding. Enola.

1070
01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:08.500
it's a secret.

1071
01:15:10.916 --> 01:15:13.666
You need to look
for what she knows. Enola.

1072
01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:18.375
Find that out.
and everything else will follow.

1073
01:15:20.666 --> 01:15:22.083
She's probably under your nose.

1074
01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:26.041
-Huh?
-Get down!

1075
01:15:28.125 --> 01:15:29.041
That's just rude.

1076
01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:33.875
-Grail.

1077
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.208
You all right. Edith?

1078
01:15:40.291 --> 01:15:41.583
Just about! Yah!

1079
01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:49.500
Yah!

1080
01:15:56.208 --> 01:15:57.541
Yah!

1081
01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:00.833
Oh. for goodness sake!

1082
01:16:06.625 --> 01:16:07.625
Oh!

1083
01:16:18.958 --> 01:16:19.958
That's not good.

1084
01:16:20.041 --> 01:16:21.583
Get 'em to the bank!

1085
01:16:22.875 --> 01:16:24.583
You all right? You all right?

1086
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:27.791
-All right?
-I'm all right. yeah.

1087
01:16:28.791 --> 01:16:29.833
Oh no.

1088
01:16:29.916 --> 01:16:30.750
Sir.

1089
01:16:35.416 --> 01:16:36.791
Glory be.

1090
01:16:37.833 --> 01:16:38.958
It's the Holy Trinity.

1091
01:16:41.916 --> 01:16:43.583
I'll make commissioner for this.

1092
01:16:44.916 --> 01:16:45.875
Take 'em.

1093
01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:48.916
Must we?

1094
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:49.875
I fear so.

Good thing
I never valued my pelvis.

How about you. Edith?

1116
01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:09.166
-How are the kidneys?
-Fine.

1117
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:10.916
I quite enjoyed it.

1118
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.083
Hm. You enjoy everything.
It's most irritating.

1119
01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:16.750
Come on. this way.
Better get a move on.

1120
01:18:16.833 --> 01:18:17.833
All right.

1121
01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:23.958
So. um. how's that useless boy of yours?

1122
01:18:25.458 --> 01:18:26.875
I hear he's doing good work.

1123
01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:30.583
-He is.
-Uh-huh.

1124
01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:34.708
Well then.
perhaps not so useless after all.

1125
01:18:35.875 --> 01:18:38.541
I wouldn't say he's "my boy."

1126
01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:46.458
You know. I sometimes think
I brought you up to be too independent.

1127
01:18:47.041 --> 01:18:49.208
-Mother!
-I did it with all of you.

1128
01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:53.458
Your purpose must be to find who you are.

1129
01:18:53.541 --> 01:18:56.333
You. Sherlock. Mycroft.

1130
01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:59.458
Strong. formidable. individual children.

1131
01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:03.166
but. well. perhaps a little lonely.

1132
01:19:06.041 --> 01:19:08.166
You will do very well on your own. Enola.

1133
01:19:08.916 --> 01:19:13.250
But with others. you could be magnificent.

1134
01:19:15.875 --> 01:19:19.375
Who do you think
organized all of this after all? Hm?

1135
01:19:19.875 --> 01:19:20.708
Me?

1136
01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.791
No. you find your allies.

1137
01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:29.750
Work with them.
and you will become more of who you are.

1138
01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:32.541
You speak with one voice.

1139
01:19:33.083 --> 01:19:36.208
and you will make more noise
than you could ever have imagined.

1140
01:19:38.416 --> 01:19:42.041
Come on. She should go.
We'll put them off her scent.

1141
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:46.291
So. you dust yourself down…

1142
01:19:49.333 --> 01:19:50.416
…keep facing forward.

1143
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:55.500
And if you ever get condemned
for murder again. you give me a shout.

1144
01:19:56.666 --> 01:19:57.500
I will.

1145
01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:03.208
Thank you. Edith.

1146
01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:09.250
Be careful.

1147
01:20:25.291 --> 01:20:26.666
And get a haircut.

1148
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:27.875
It's a mess.

1149
01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:31.750
I think my hair is fine.

1150
01:20:45.083 --> 01:20:46.250
Come on.

1151
01:20:51.208 --> 01:20:52.833
I need you to pack your things.

1152
01:20:52.916 --> 01:20:55.125
I need you to be in a safer place.

1153
01:20:55.208 --> 01:20:57.833
Is… Is my sister gone?

1154
01:20:57.916 --> 01:20:59.500
-Like Mae?
-No.

1155
01:20:59.583 --> 01:21:00.750
-Is she--
-No.

1156
01:21:00.833 --> 01:21:02.333
I'm sure she's all right.

1157
01:21:02.416 --> 01:21:04.333
I'm closer to finding her.

1158
01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:07.083
Doris.

1159
01:21:08.583 --> 01:21:09.666
she'll take me in.

1160
01:21:10.291 --> 01:21:12.000
She's got a spare bed now.

1161
01:21:13.916 --> 01:21:14.750
Her sister?

1162
01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:17.291
Dead.

1163
01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:18.208
Typhus.

1164
01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:24.208
Dead.

1165
01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:38.416
There's traces of something in this soil.

1166
01:21:41.083 --> 01:21:42.958
One has red. and one has white in it.

1167
01:21:46.416 --> 01:21:50.166
The matches you make.
when did they change from red to white?

1168
01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:52.625
I dunno. Around two years ago.

1169
01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:58.541
In two years. he's turned red into black.
Or should I say red into white?

1170
01:21:59.125 --> 01:22:00.916
Typhus.
The plague of our times.

1171
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.583
Two years it's been killing these girls.

1172
01:22:23.541 --> 01:22:24.375
Out.

1173
01:22:25.625 --> 01:22:26.833
What are you looking at?

1174
01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:01.750
I need your help.

1175
01:23:04.416 --> 01:23:06.166
Don't make me repeat it! May I come in?

1176
01:23:08.208 --> 01:23:11.541
Firstly. I would like to apologize
for so much.

1177
01:23:11.625 --> 01:23:14.083
I have failed
to see allies in plain sight.

1178
01:23:14.166 --> 01:23:15.250
-And I have--
-Enola.

1179
01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:17.916
There's something I wish to say too.

1180
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.375
-All right.
-If you'd just--

1181
01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:29.041
All day. every day.
all I do is compromise.

1182
01:23:30.208 --> 01:23:33.416
If I vote for this lord's bill that will
allow him to pump bilge water into a lake.

1183
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.583
then he will vote for my forestry reform.

1184
01:23:35.666 --> 01:23:39.083
I want to stand up and say.
"This isn't right." but I have no allies.

1185
01:23:39.875 --> 01:23:42.500
So to do so
would be to risk all that is good.

1186
01:23:42.583 --> 01:23:45.291
so I lie awake trying to work out
which path to follow.

1187
01:23:46.166 --> 01:23:47.000
alone.

1188
01:23:48.833 --> 01:23:50.416
There is no search for a wife.

1189
01:23:51.375 --> 01:23:54.708
because politics consumes me constantly.

1190
01:23:57.625 --> 01:23:59.625
That is the speech I stored up for you.

1191
01:24:02.875 --> 01:24:03.875
You're a good man.

1192
01:24:05.166 --> 01:24:06.083
I'm a man now?

1193
01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:07.750
On occasion.

1194
01:24:08.416 --> 01:24:11.500
But I understand your struggle.
because I struggle too.

1195
01:24:12.291 --> 01:24:14.250
I am sorry we cannot talk more.
because I have--

1196
01:24:14.333 --> 01:24:16.208
A case to solve?

1197
01:24:20.666 --> 01:24:22.916
The girl I'm looking for. Sarah Chapman.

1198
01:24:23.791 --> 01:24:25.541
she has proof that girls are dying

1199
01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:27.958
from the phosphorus
they work with every day.

1200
01:24:28.041 --> 01:24:31.541
And the factory
are trying to cover it up as typhus.

1201
01:24:32.583 --> 01:24:33.541
She knows it.

1202
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:36.833
and someone is going to kill her for it.

1203
01:24:36.916 --> 01:24:38.000
Then what can we do?

1204
01:24:40.333 --> 01:24:41.166
We?

1205
01:24:47.333 --> 01:24:50.333
-Don't open it. it could be the police.
-You're still wanted by the police?

1206
01:24:50.416 --> 01:24:52.583
-Of course. I escaped jail.
-You escaped?

1207
01:24:52.666 --> 01:24:53.833
Forget I told you that.

1208
01:24:55.416 --> 01:24:58.500
The lights are on. If I don't answer.
they'll suspect more. Hide.

1209
01:24:58.583 --> 01:25:00.250
-Coming.

1210
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:04.625
-Miss Cicely.
-I'm sorry it's so late.

1211
01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:08.375
No. no. not at all.
I-I told you to come. I-I want to help.

1212
01:25:08.458 --> 01:25:10.625
-Is anyone else here?
-No.

1213
01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:11.958
-Um--
-Good.

1214
01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:15.458
Better we are alone. for it is imperative
that I speak with you.

1215
01:25:15.958 --> 01:25:18.541
Sir. I feel that you're a man
of great character

1216
01:25:18.625 --> 01:25:19.750
and that I can trust you.

1217
01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:23.750
Which is why I fear I may have to unburden
myself. and it may prove shocking.

1218
01:25:23.833 --> 01:25:24.916
Miss Cicely--

1219
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.041
It's just. I've been wanting
to speak with you about… a relationship.

1220
01:25:29.125 --> 01:25:32.416
Oh. that. Yes. Uh. perhaps
we can discuss this another time?

1221
01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:34.291
Please. sir.

1222
01:25:34.375 --> 01:25:37.750
I'm terribly sorry. Let me assure you.
I do share your interest.

1223
01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:40.291
-We will talk again.
-Thank you.

1224
01:25:43.291 --> 01:25:45.625
She's gone. She was flustered.

1225
01:25:48.458 --> 01:25:51.291
Do not think of doubting me.
Cicely was here for my help.

1226
01:25:51.875 --> 01:25:55.000
She told me at the ball that she's working
on a bill to change factory law.

1227
01:25:56.333 --> 01:25:58.833
She's unearthed something.
some corruption or other.

1228
01:25:59.458 --> 01:26:00.708
She's doing what?

1229
01:26:05.291 --> 01:26:09.125
Enola. if you have any concerns.
I tell you categorically. I…

1230
01:26:09.208 --> 01:26:10.875
I have no eyes for anyone. but…

1231
01:26:12.541 --> 01:26:14.666
Well. no. this is not
quite how I wanted to say that.

1232
01:26:15.708 --> 01:26:18.583
But to say.
in terms of romantic interests.

1233
01:26:19.083 --> 01:26:21.250
yes. my interest is…

1234
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:24.458
The reason I don't have to search.
I'm busy with politics. like I said…

1235
01:26:24.541 --> 01:26:25.958
You admire Lord Tewkesbury?

1236
01:26:26.041 --> 01:26:28.666
I hear he is a good man
and a great reformer.

1237
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:31.125
The woman I would be most interested in--

1238
01:26:31.208 --> 01:26:32.583
I mustn't lose my chance.

1239
01:26:33.916 --> 01:26:34.916
You're not listening.

1240
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.791
Good evening. Lord Tewkesbury.

1241
01:26:36.875 --> 01:26:38.583
She didn't have a chaperone.

1242
01:26:40.833 --> 01:26:43.208
You got five seconds
to tell me why you're here.

1243
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.291
I have been blind!

1244
01:26:45.375 --> 01:26:48.250
The phosphorus in the match-making
has mixed with oxygen.

1245
01:26:49.166 --> 01:26:50.666
I have missed everything.

1246
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:52.208
She's probably under your nose.

1247
01:26:55.541 --> 01:26:56.875
Cicely.

1248
01:27:05.458 --> 01:27:07.583
Sarah is Cicely.

1249
01:27:09.375 --> 01:27:11.250
Cicely is Sarah!

1250
01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:13.083
-Enola!

1251
01:27:13.708 --> 01:27:15.000
Enola. what on Earth…

1252
01:27:17.458 --> 01:27:19.375
Enola. did you understand what I said?

1253
01:27:20.083 --> 01:27:24.083
Or rather what I didn't say?
Did you understand… what I didn't say?

1254
01:27:24.166 --> 01:27:26.375
Yes. You were saying that you…

1255
01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:35.916
You'll learn.

1256
01:27:37.041 --> 01:27:40.833
That message
you sent me with the fan at the ball.

1257
01:27:40.916 --> 01:27:41.833
what did it mean?

1258
01:27:45.666 --> 01:27:46.708
It means I love you.

1259
01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:58.250
Ladies and gentlemen.
to the future.

1260
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:03.750
Of course.

1261
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.333
They were working together. in love.

1262
01:28:09.458 --> 01:28:10.833
They had a plan.

1263
01:28:12.208 --> 01:28:16.583
To expose the corruption in that factory
and stop what his father was doing.

1264
01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:18.625
They wanted your help.

1265
01:28:18.708 --> 01:28:20.833
William Lyon invited you to that ball.

1266
01:28:20.916 --> 01:28:22.458
He's a radical just like you.

1267
01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:25.166
They needed my help. You're right.

1268
01:28:25.958 --> 01:28:27.750
But. Enola. we must return inside.

1269
01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:30.166
The police are pursuing you.
and we have much to talk of.

1270
01:28:30.250 --> 01:28:32.916
No! I know we have much to talk of.
my dear. dear lord.

1271
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.125
You love me.

1272
01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:36.250
And as it turns out. I love you too.

1273
01:28:37.583 --> 01:28:38.583
You love me too?

1274
01:28:41.041 --> 01:28:42.833
You really are a nincompoop.

1275
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:45.833
Now hail a cab.

1276
01:28:57.083 --> 01:29:00.875
-Shh. You're walking loudly.
-But it's gravel.

1277
01:29:00.958 --> 01:29:02.958
-You've got large feet.
-I know.

1278
01:29:08.291 --> 01:29:10.541
Wait here. Keep guard.

1279
01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:12.916
If anyone comes.
just tell them you're a lord.

1280
01:29:13.708 --> 01:29:14.583
I am a lord.

1281
01:29:15.291 --> 01:29:16.916
Then they'll likely believe you.

1282
01:29:17.583 --> 01:29:18.416
All right.

1283
01:30:09.833 --> 01:30:11.041
You.

1284
01:30:13.458 --> 01:30:15.750
-How ridiculous you are.
-I'm ridiculous?

1285
01:30:15.833 --> 01:30:18.000
I told you to stay safe and stay away.

1286
01:30:18.083 --> 01:30:20.791
Now you're breaking out of prison
and have the police after you.

1287
01:30:21.291 --> 01:30:24.125
Oh. Are you hurt? I am sorry.

1288
01:30:24.208 --> 01:30:25.666
Are you not hurt?

1289
01:30:27.208 --> 01:30:28.208
It seems not.

1290
01:30:29.125 --> 01:30:29.958
Hm.

1291
01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:32.583
I wonder who taught you
to fight like that.

1292
01:30:33.333 --> 01:30:35.083
Another thing our mother
has to answer for.

1293
01:30:35.166 --> 01:30:37.583
She should have fed me as well as you
is what I think.

1294
01:30:38.625 --> 01:30:41.458
Hang on. Why are you here?
Is it my case. or your own?

1295
01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:45.416
Both. I know how Grail
got your fingerprints.

1296
01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.416
Oxidized phosphorus dust

1297
01:30:48.333 --> 01:30:50.708
lifted from the table
and applied to the knife.

1298
01:30:51.791 --> 01:30:52.625
You're innocent.

1299
01:30:53.916 --> 01:30:55.041
You doubted it?

1300
01:30:55.791 --> 01:30:57.541
Nothing's certain till it's proved.

1301
01:30:59.416 --> 01:31:00.500
And your case?

1302
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.166
My adversary. his trail.

1303
01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:04.916
it leads here.

1304
01:31:06.875 --> 01:31:08.833
It seems our cases are connected.

1305
01:31:11.083 --> 01:31:11.958
Shall we?

1306
01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:45.416
William Lyon.

1307
01:31:46.875 --> 01:31:48.416
Sarah's love.

1308
01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:50.791
And my thief in a taper crown hat.

1309
01:31:57.458 --> 01:32:01.000
Stay unemotional. There's nothing more
we can do for him now.

1310
01:32:01.708 --> 01:32:04.375
Need to keep our minds fresh
and our eyes sharp.

1311
01:32:04.875 --> 01:32:06.250
He was seized.

1312
01:32:07.583 --> 01:32:10.500
-Yes. and searched.
-For the document he took?

1313
01:32:11.833 --> 01:32:12.666
A knife?

1314
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:14.250
No. bigger.

1315
01:32:15.833 --> 01:32:16.791
A cutlass.

1316
01:32:18.916 --> 01:32:20.208
Heavy boot scuffs.

1317
01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:24.208
and scratch marks from a cane
that has a metal ferrule.

1318
01:32:26.083 --> 01:32:27.250
Grail.

1319
01:32:28.291 --> 01:32:29.791
But at whose behest?

1320
01:32:30.916 --> 01:32:32.666
There was another in this room.

1321
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:34.333
This cigar had a holder.

1322
01:32:38.041 --> 01:32:39.708
And traces of wool.

1323
01:32:42.083 --> 01:32:44.625
Astrakhan. the finest.

1324
01:32:44.708 --> 01:32:49.083
Well. Lord McIntyre.
if I. um. might suggest a little lunch.

1325
01:32:50.416 --> 01:32:53.166
Leave me be. please.
They're watching.

1326
01:32:56.583 --> 01:32:58.041
Where did William steal from?

1327
01:32:58.541 --> 01:33:00.583
-The Treasury Office?
-Yes.

1328
01:33:00.666 --> 01:33:03.333
The office of Lord McIntyre.
Treasury Minister.

1329
01:33:03.916 --> 01:33:05.166
How did you come to that?

1330
01:33:06.375 --> 01:33:08.500
I think what William stole was proof

1331
01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.500
that Lyon and McIntyre
were conspiring together.

1332
01:33:12.583 --> 01:33:14.208
-Corruption.
-Yes.

1333
01:33:14.291 --> 01:33:16.041
Fueled by greed.

1334
01:33:16.708 --> 01:33:20.083
McIntyre has been secretly profiting
from the factory.

1335
01:33:20.166 --> 01:33:23.041
They changed the match formula
to a cheaper phosphorus.

1336
01:33:24.541 --> 01:33:25.708
and it's deadly.

1337
01:33:26.333 --> 01:33:27.208
Enola?

1338
01:33:27.291 --> 01:33:28.833
Enola. I was concerned for you.

1339
01:33:28.916 --> 01:33:31.708
You left me out there in the dark.
and I nearly tore my…

1340
01:33:35.208 --> 01:33:37.125
-Sherlock Holmes? How do--
-Not the time.

1341
01:33:39.416 --> 01:33:40.291
Oh my…

1342
01:33:41.666 --> 01:33:43.000
-Is he--
-Stay unemotional.

1343
01:33:44.833 --> 01:33:47.166
-Who did this?
-Lord McIntyre.

1344
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:49.791
-No.
-But it all fits.

1345
01:33:49.875 --> 01:33:53.083
No one has sat in this chair.
No marks on the carpet. no indentation.

1346
01:33:53.166 --> 01:33:56.291
The cigar has been smoked. but cold.

1347
01:33:57.125 --> 01:33:59.625
And look. no ash.

1348
01:34:01.875 --> 01:34:04.541
-No lips have touched that glass.
-Exactly.

1349
01:34:04.625 --> 01:34:07.125
These clues
have been planted for us to find.

1350
01:34:07.708 --> 01:34:09.250
to mislead us from the true villain.

1351
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:11.500
This has all been staged.

1352
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:14.083
By who?

1353
01:34:14.833 --> 01:34:18.958
Not McIntyre. but by someone who had
a lot to lose without that document.

1354
01:34:19.041 --> 01:34:22.000
Someone who knew what they were up to
and was blackmailing them.

1355
01:34:23.375 --> 01:34:24.375
My opponent.

1356
01:34:27.208 --> 01:34:28.875
Someone who likes a game.

1357
01:34:30.833 --> 01:34:34.083
-Did they get what they wanted?
-No. I don't think so.

1358
01:34:36.958 --> 01:34:37.833
Poor William.

1359
01:34:47.708 --> 01:34:48.541
Hm.

1360
01:34:55.416 --> 01:34:58.541
-They did get something.
-Mae's terrible music.

1361
01:34:59.208 --> 01:35:00.916
"The Truth of the Gods."

1362
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.750
Could be biblical. mythical.

1363
01:35:02.833 --> 01:35:03.708
Theatrical?

1364
01:35:07.416 --> 01:35:10.166
The Gods is the top row of the theater.

1365
01:35:10.833 --> 01:35:11.708
The balcony.

1366
01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:14.125
Doesn't everyone know that?

1367
01:35:16.083 --> 01:35:17.208
This isn't music.

1368
01:35:26.125 --> 01:35:27.000
It's a map.

1369
01:35:36.958 --> 01:35:39.625
Just to be clear
as to what we might be about to face…

1370
01:35:40.958 --> 01:35:43.541
There may be some violence.
You've faced it before.

1371
01:35:44.458 --> 01:35:45.333
Yes.

1372
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.791
I did have part of a suit of armor on.

1373
01:35:48.291 --> 01:35:51.416
But yes. fighting will be…

1374
01:35:52.458 --> 01:35:53.291
Yes.

1375
01:35:53.375 --> 01:35:55.750
-You've been in a fight before?
-Yes. plenty of fights.

1376
01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:56.958
Fenced for my school.

1377
01:35:57.875 --> 01:35:58.708
Mm.

1378
01:36:02.458 --> 01:36:04.458
Fine. Can you teach me to fight?

1379
01:36:05.375 --> 01:36:07.833
What. right now? In a carriage?

1380
01:36:07.916 --> 01:36:10.916
Did I not teach you to dance
in five minutes in a bathroom?

1381
01:36:12.083 --> 01:36:14.166
All right. Fine.

1382
01:36:18.166 --> 01:36:21.750
There are two secrets to fighting.
Avoid the punch. make the counterpunch.

1383
01:36:23.250 --> 01:36:24.916
I don't see how two secrets-- Ow!

1384
01:36:26.041 --> 01:36:27.375
Your first lesson.

1385
01:36:27.458 --> 01:36:28.291
Ow.

1386
01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:30.375
Ow!

1387
01:36:30.458 --> 01:36:32.583
Your second. You didn't avoid the punch.

1388
01:36:32.666 --> 01:36:35.833
-You can hardly expect me to hit a girl.
-Oh dear.

1389
01:36:35.916 --> 01:36:36.750
I'm not some-- Ow!

1390
01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:38.958
Ow! Will you stop that?

1391
01:36:39.458 --> 01:36:41.000
I can't stop.

1392
01:36:42.583 --> 01:36:45.958
-We're approaching.

1393
01:37:11.416 --> 01:37:13.166
I may need more of those lessons.

1394
01:37:38.583 --> 01:37:40.250
X marks the spot.

1395
01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:00.791
Sarah.

1396
01:38:03.583 --> 01:38:04.458
It's all there.

1397
01:38:06.250 --> 01:38:07.750
All the proof we need.

1398
01:38:09.458 --> 01:38:12.666
The contract
between Lyon and McIntyre

1399
01:38:13.541 --> 01:38:15.083
to change the phosphorus.

1400
01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:19.000
What William stole for you.

1401
01:38:24.166 --> 01:38:27.541
And the pages from the factory register.

1402
01:38:27.625 --> 01:38:29.750
That's what you stole from the office.

1403
01:38:31.125 --> 01:38:33.333
These are the names
of the girls they killed.

1404
01:38:33.416 --> 01:38:35.208
I couldn't let 'em be forgotten.

1405
01:38:37.125 --> 01:38:40.958
And it's proof that match girls
are dying from working in that factory.

1406
01:38:41.458 --> 01:38:42.833
and they knew it all along.

1407
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.291
You're a bloody good detective.
Enola Holmes.

1408
01:38:49.708 --> 01:38:51.250
You are too. Sarah Chapman.

1409
01:38:55.416 --> 01:38:57.750
I will share this with the world.
I promise you.

1410
01:38:59.875 --> 01:39:00.708
Thank you.

1411
01:39:02.291 --> 01:39:05.041
Now we must find William.
He was supposed to meet me six hours ago.

1412
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.083
I'm afraid William won't be coming.

1413
01:39:15.833 --> 01:39:16.666
What?

1414
01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:21.083
I'm sorry.

1415
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:24.083
I'm so sorry.

1416
01:39:30.041 --> 01:39:32.000
I told him we had everything we needed.

1417
01:39:33.250 --> 01:39:34.750
That we should just go public.

1418
01:39:37.625 --> 01:39:41.583
He said nobody would care unless we had
someone in power who would listen.

1419
01:39:44.458 --> 01:39:46.583
He was just trying to keep me safe.

1420
01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:50.041
And now I've lost him.

1421
01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:53.000
We must move quickly.
or we'll lose you too.

1422
01:39:54.083 --> 01:39:55.791
Losing this…

1423
01:39:58.458 --> 01:39:59.708
losing that.

1424
01:40:03.458 --> 01:40:05.625
-Seems you've lost everything.
-Bessie!

1425
01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:08.083
You've all been very careless.

1426
01:40:14.083 --> 01:40:15.041
I'll take those.

1427
01:40:15.125 --> 01:40:16.333
Let go of her.

1428
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.708
Give me the papers and I will.

1429
01:40:35.875 --> 01:40:37.208
Run. Bessie!

1430
01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:46.333
-Don't just stand there!

1431
01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:53.375
Ow!

1432
01:40:53.458 --> 01:40:56.750
-Get after them!

1433
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:14.833
Ow.

1434
01:41:20.166 --> 01:41:21.958
Avoid the punch. make the counterpunch.

1435
01:41:44.916 --> 01:41:45.833
Tewkesbury!

1436
01:42:47.041 --> 01:42:48.250
Argh!

1437
01:42:48.333 --> 01:42:49.166
Argh.

1438
01:42:54.541 --> 01:42:55.500
No!

1439
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:07.125
Bessie!

1440
01:43:08.708 --> 01:43:10.000
Run.

1441
01:43:11.291 --> 01:43:12.541
I said run!

1442
01:43:57.041 --> 01:43:58.041
Enola!

1443
01:44:05.166 --> 01:44:08.125
-You got more to you than I thought.

1444
01:45:14.250 --> 01:45:15.083
Huh.

1445
01:45:17.416 --> 01:45:19.583
What places we find ourselves in.

1446
01:45:24.666 --> 01:45:26.291
What places indeed.

1447
01:45:30.458 --> 01:45:32.833
I've always loved the theater.

1448
01:45:36.958 --> 01:45:37.791
Got it?

1449
01:45:37.875 --> 01:45:41.916
I used to dream
I'd end up on the stage.

1450
01:45:43.875 --> 01:45:45.083
You're not rid of me yet.

1451
01:45:45.166 --> 01:45:47.250
Viscount Tewkesbury.
Marquess of Basilwether.

1452
01:45:57.583 --> 01:45:59.083
Enola!

1453
01:46:06.208 --> 01:46:07.541
-Hurrah!

1454
01:46:18.833 --> 01:46:19.875
Are you all right?

1455
01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:27.875
You were made to fight.

1456
01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:40.958
Congratulations.

1457
01:46:43.083 --> 01:46:45.416
Lord McIntyre.
What are you doing here?

1458
01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:47.833
I was summoned.

1459
01:46:48.666 --> 01:46:52.416
Your brother knew that I would want
to see the right people shown justice.

1460
01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:54.666
And I don't know how to thank you

1461
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:57.291
for retrieving this government property

1462
01:46:57.375 --> 01:46:59.666
and. uh. bringing this killer to light.

1463
01:46:59.750 --> 01:47:03.583
A rot amongst our ranks.

1464
01:47:06.166 --> 01:47:09.416
The world shall know
the name Enola Holmes.

1465
01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:10.666
I'll make sure of it.

1466
01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:14.541
Lestrade. arrest that girl.

1467
01:47:15.541 --> 01:47:17.833
-She's done nothing wrong.

1468
01:47:17.916 --> 01:47:19.833
On what charge. sir?

1469
01:47:19.916 --> 01:47:23.458
-Theft.
-All she stole from you was the truth.

1470
01:47:23.541 --> 01:47:25.708
She took personal information.

1471
01:47:26.625 --> 01:47:30.625
which she used
for extortion and blackmail.

1472
01:47:30.708 --> 01:47:33.416
Which is why she will serve her time.

1473
01:47:33.916 --> 01:47:34.750
Ah.

1474
01:47:36.958 --> 01:47:38.083
But you are mistaken.

1475
01:47:39.166 --> 01:47:42.041
She was not your blackmailer.

1476
01:47:42.541 --> 01:47:45.416
I summoned you here
to draw that very person out.

1477
01:47:46.041 --> 01:47:47.791
The accounting was masterful.

1478
01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:52.791
A tangle of roots.
but all pointed to one pocket.

1479
01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:57.375
One person
receiving the fruits of their schemes

1480
01:47:57.458 --> 01:47:58.750
with no one noticing.

1481
01:48:00.375 --> 01:48:03.416
Hearing everything. seeing everything.

1482
01:48:04.791 --> 01:48:06.833
Ignored for years.

1483
01:48:06.916 --> 01:48:08.333
Playing them all.

1484
01:48:09.708 --> 01:48:10.708
It's all a game.

1485
01:48:12.708 --> 01:48:15.750
And it's fun. once you know the rules.

1486
01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:22.416
Miss Mira Troy.

1487
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.583
Absurd.

1488
01:48:25.541 --> 01:48:27.083
Oh. I don't believe it.

1489
01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:32.125
It's remarkable
what can be done

1490
01:48:32.208 --> 01:48:35.875
when people underestimate you.

1491
01:48:37.208 --> 01:48:38.666
And then came the problem.

1492
01:48:39.875 --> 01:48:41.125
William stole the contract.

1493
01:48:41.208 --> 01:48:43.083
He threatened to cut off your money train.

1494
01:48:43.166 --> 01:48:44.541
And you couldn't have that.

1495
01:48:45.250 --> 01:48:47.708
You hired Grail to retrieve the document.

1496
01:48:48.666 --> 01:48:50.916
but things got out of hand.

1497
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.208
so you tried to point us to Lord McIntyre.

1498
01:48:54.208 --> 01:48:56.083
A rare misstep in your game…

1499
01:48:58.125 --> 01:48:59.166
Moriarty.

1500
01:49:06.291 --> 01:49:10.833
Such a shame our divertissement
has to end. Mr. Holmes.

1501
01:49:12.083 --> 01:49:16.208
I was so enjoying it.

1502
01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:20.416
And you. Enola.

1503
01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:24.458
Miss Troy. you have been behind this?

1504
01:49:25.916 --> 01:49:29.333
Of course. you never can find
the proper staff.

1505
01:49:30.041 --> 01:49:31.750
I only wanted the agreements back.

1506
01:49:32.708 --> 01:49:35.333
Though I couldn't be seen
to question William myself.

1507
01:49:35.416 --> 01:49:37.291
you were so obliging.

1508
01:49:39.083 --> 01:49:43.166
If you wish to speak with William.
you could always try with that.

1509
01:49:46.875 --> 01:49:51.041
Just a pity he was smarter
and braver in the end than I'd expected.

1510
01:49:51.125 --> 01:49:55.666
They both were.
Their deaths were so unnecessary.

1511
01:49:56.291 --> 01:50:02.958
But Superintendent Grail
was somewhat of a blunt instrument.

1512
01:50:03.541 --> 01:50:04.958
You!

1513
01:50:05.041 --> 01:50:07.875
How dare you take advantage
of your position!

1514
01:50:10.833 --> 01:50:13.166
I take advantage?

1515
01:50:14.875 --> 01:50:17.583
What were my advantages?

1516
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:22.833
Treated like a common servant
when I have twice the mind of yours.

1517
01:50:24.958 --> 01:50:26.416
Any of yours.

1518
01:50:28.833 --> 01:50:32.625
Why shouldn't I have a share
of your ill-begotten riches

1519
01:50:32.708 --> 01:50:35.125
and punish you at the same time?

1520
01:50:36.208 --> 01:50:39.458
Why shouldn't I be rewarded
for what I can do?

1521
01:50:40.791 --> 01:50:46.041
Where is my place in this… society?

1522
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:48.416
I am a woman.

1523
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.833
I cannot join clubs.

1524
01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:52.583
I cannot own shares.

1525
01:50:52.666 --> 01:50:55.583
I cannot advance myself as they can.

1526
01:50:56.791 --> 01:50:57.625
So…

1527
01:51:00.416 --> 01:51:03.000
I found my own way.

1528
01:51:05.375 --> 01:51:10.125
And it was fun.

1529
01:51:14.500 --> 01:51:15.833
Lestrade.

1530
01:51:17.666 --> 01:51:19.666
take her away.

1531
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:20.583
Yes. sir.

1532
01:51:23.041 --> 01:51:24.041
On what charge. sir?

1533
01:51:24.958 --> 01:51:26.833
-Extortion.
-Uh. yes. yes.

1534
01:51:26.916 --> 01:51:27.875
Blackmail. murder.

1535
01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:29.583
Go.

1536
01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:33.708
Such a shame our little dance has to end.

1537
01:51:35.041 --> 01:51:36.666
For now at least.

1538
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:38.833
Perhaps we shall take to the floor again.

1539
01:51:47.083 --> 01:51:48.083
No!

1540
01:51:48.791 --> 01:51:50.208
No!

1541
01:51:52.041 --> 01:51:54.250
Well. there. That's that then.

1542
01:51:56.166 --> 01:51:59.166
I accidentally burnt my own property.
What of it?

1543
01:52:00.458 --> 01:52:03.041
You are corrupt. sir.

1544
01:52:03.125 --> 01:52:05.833
And complicit in the deaths
of hundreds of match girls.

1545
01:52:07.208 --> 01:52:08.500
Where is your proof?

1546
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:11.291
Good.

1547
01:52:11.375 --> 01:52:14.958
So… back to business.

1548
01:52:16.291 --> 01:52:18.166
-Sir. you cannot--
-Tewkesbury.

1549
01:52:20.875 --> 01:52:21.708
Patience.

1550
01:52:28.833 --> 01:52:29.833
Glory be.

1551
01:52:41.916 --> 01:52:44.833
All those names. those lives.

1552
01:52:45.833 --> 01:52:46.916
I failed 'em. Enola.

1553
01:52:47.583 --> 01:52:48.708
Don't say that.

1554
01:52:50.458 --> 01:52:51.333
Mae gone…

1555
01:52:54.375 --> 01:52:55.250
William gone.

1556
01:52:56.791 --> 01:52:58.541
and they're gonna get away with it.

1557
01:52:59.750 --> 01:53:01.750
You heard the man. "Where's your proof?"

1558
01:53:03.291 --> 01:53:04.291
What do we have now?

1559
01:53:09.166 --> 01:53:10.375
We have each other…

1560
01:53:13.583 --> 01:53:15.166
and we have the truth.

1561
01:53:27.041 --> 01:53:29.875
You're late. Bess Chapman.
Docking you a penny.

1562
01:53:32.625 --> 01:53:33.541
Oi.

1563
01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.625
You're not welcome here no more.

1564
01:53:38.208 --> 01:53:40.125
What are you doing? Oi!

1565
01:53:40.708 --> 01:53:41.541
Get down.

1566
01:53:42.250 --> 01:53:43.541
Get down!

1567
01:53:44.041 --> 01:53:45.750
Let her speak!

1568
01:53:49.833 --> 01:53:51.041
A few weeks ago.

1569
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:55.666
Mae Izley. William Lyon. and I

1570
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:57.375
set out to prove something.

1571
01:53:59.041 --> 01:54:01.333
To prove that this factory
was killing people.

1572
01:54:02.791 --> 01:54:03.958
and they knew it.

1573
01:54:04.041 --> 01:54:07.458
But they decided that profit
mattered more than we did.

1574
01:54:08.916 --> 01:54:11.166
-You're coming with me.
-Shh!

1575
01:54:11.250 --> 01:54:14.333
It ain't typhus that's killing us.
It's the phosphorus.

1576
01:54:15.041 --> 01:54:16.750
What we work with every day.

1577
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:19.750
You lying little toerag.

1578
01:54:19.833 --> 01:54:21.375
That's a penny off your wages!

1579
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:25.083
These were our friends…

1580
01:54:27.416 --> 01:54:28.500
our sisters…

1581
01:54:33.791 --> 01:54:35.083
and our children.

1582
01:54:36.875 --> 01:54:39.291
Well. it stops now.

1583
01:54:41.458 --> 01:54:44.625
It's time for us to use
the only thing we have. Ourselves.

1584
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:49.250
It's time for us to refuse to work.

1585
01:54:49.333 --> 01:54:51.000
It's time to tell 'em no.

1586
01:54:51.791 --> 01:54:53.666
-Right. get back to work.
-No!

1587
01:54:55.208 --> 01:54:57.625
You leave here. there is no coming back.

1588
01:54:59.125 --> 01:55:01.375
You will not get employed here again.

1589
01:55:02.875 --> 01:55:05.958
Well. will you join me?

1590
01:55:09.541 --> 01:55:11.000
Think of your families.

1591
01:55:11.833 --> 01:55:13.125
Don't do it. girls.

1592
01:55:13.208 --> 01:55:15.666
It is not worth the risk.

1593
01:55:16.375 --> 01:55:17.208
Well.

1594
01:55:18.916 --> 01:55:19.791
will ya?

1595
01:55:20.375 --> 01:55:22.416
This is how the world works.

1596
01:55:23.625 --> 01:55:24.458
Please. girls.

1597
01:55:26.333 --> 01:55:28.541
I know you're scared. I am too.

1598
01:55:28.625 --> 01:55:30.333
But it's the only power we have!

1599
01:55:37.791 --> 01:55:38.625
Right.

1600
01:55:40.416 --> 01:55:42.916
get that machine back on
and get back to work.

1601
01:55:49.833 --> 01:55:50.666
Right.

1602
01:55:54.166 --> 01:55:55.000
No.

1603
01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:58.000
This can't be their future.

1604
01:55:59.208 --> 01:56:00.166
I'm sorry. Enola.

1605
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.541
-Stop that.

1606
01:56:19.083 --> 01:56:20.750
-Stop that.

1607
01:56:25.958 --> 01:56:27.250
Be one voice.

1608
01:56:31.458 --> 01:56:33.541
-That's enough!

1609
01:56:45.916 --> 01:56:46.916
Stop that!

1610
01:56:57.500 --> 01:56:59.541
Can't anyone control these bloody women?

1611
01:57:06.083 --> 01:57:07.083
Come on. girls.

1612
01:57:44.916 --> 01:57:47.375
-Where are you going?
-Westminster!

1613
01:57:50.083 --> 01:57:51.000
There they go.

1614
01:57:52.041 --> 01:57:53.500
That's a whole lot of noise.

1615
01:57:54.958 --> 01:57:56.916
She likes causing trouble. doesn't she?

1616
01:57:57.500 --> 01:57:59.958
It's as if she was molded that way.

1617
01:58:03.333 --> 01:58:04.916
She still needs that haircut.

1618
01:58:15.083 --> 01:58:17.458
Seems your boy has learned how to fight.

1619
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:20.916
Lord McIntyre.

1620
01:58:25.333 --> 01:58:26.166
Indeed.

1621
01:58:27.375 --> 01:58:28.291
He's not my boy.

1622
01:58:35.083 --> 01:58:36.583
"Pay what you can."

1623
01:58:37.291 --> 01:58:39.916
And what will people pay you in?
Potatoes and gratitude?

1624
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.333
If that's all they have.

1625
01:58:41.416 --> 01:58:44.541
You can deal with the hoits and toits.
This is where I should be.

1626
01:58:45.125 --> 01:58:47.125
Edith said she'll be kind with the rent.

1627
01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:54.291
You know. you are aware. should you wish
some finer surrounds. I could. uh…

1628
01:58:56.416 --> 01:58:57.291
I was thinking…

1629
01:59:00.250 --> 01:59:01.416
Holmes and Holmes?

1630
01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:05.083
A partnership?

1631
01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:11.041
That is the kindest offer.

1632
01:59:12.333 --> 01:59:15.458
But if I did that.
I would always be in your shadow.

1633
01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:17.458
Hm. Yes.

1634
01:59:21.833 --> 01:59:24.083
Though I do like this new version of you.

1635
01:59:24.875 --> 01:59:26.708
No one should be alone all the time.

1636
01:59:28.083 --> 01:59:29.375
A friend would do you well.

1637
01:59:31.875 --> 01:59:33.541
Perhaps I should write that down.

1638
01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:39.375
I shall drop by to check on you.

1639
01:59:40.041 --> 01:59:41.125
I would like that.

1640
01:59:41.916 --> 01:59:45.125
Perhaps you could come to Baker Street
from time to time…

1641
01:59:47.208 --> 01:59:48.208
to check on me.

1642
01:59:52.416 --> 01:59:56.000
Perhaps we can fix on Thursday. 4 p.m.

1643
01:59:56.916 --> 01:59:58.166
Thursday at- 00 it is.

1644
02:00:00.666 --> 02:00:03.416
It seems I shan't be the last
to interrupt you today.

1645
02:00:05.625 --> 02:00:06.625
And he has flowers.

1646
02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:11.666
-Sherlock.
-Tewkesbury.

1647
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:14.041
-See you on Thursday.
-Bye. Sherlock.

1648
02:00:23.208 --> 02:00:24.375
-Sherlock?
-Yes.

1649
02:00:24.458 --> 02:00:25.375
Your paper.

1650
02:00:26.250 --> 02:00:27.083
Thank you.

1651
02:00:27.666 --> 02:00:28.500
And…

1652
02:00:30.125 --> 02:00:32.666
thank you… for everything.

1653
02:00:51.708 --> 02:00:54.708
Tewkesbury. when did I give you
the impression that I like flowers?

1654
02:00:54.791 --> 02:00:57.458
They're called Spreading Bellflowers.
Wild. of course.

1655
02:00:58.041 --> 02:01:00.791
Attracted to ancient woodland.
wiry. deceptive.

1656
02:01:01.458 --> 02:01:03.458
refuse to behave according to any rules.

1657
02:01:03.541 --> 02:01:07.958
but their petals are so delicate.
and their flowers--

1658
02:01:08.041 --> 02:01:09.000
Two things.

1659
02:01:09.083 --> 02:01:12.041
Your metaphor is tortured.
and I don't have delicate petals.

1660
02:01:12.125 --> 02:01:13.500
Oh. and. and. and…

1661
02:01:14.916 --> 02:01:18.166
It is an invitation to a ball
being given by--

1662
02:01:18.250 --> 02:01:22.333
Uh. I am not going to a ball with you.
I got arrested at the last one.

1663
02:01:23.666 --> 02:01:26.875
Well. all the more reason to dance again.
wouldn't you say?

1664
02:01:26.958 --> 02:01:30.083
-You're a nincompoop.
-And you are a coward.

1665
02:01:30.166 --> 02:01:33.041
How dare you speak to a lady
like that? You are a disgrace. sir.

1666
02:01:33.125 --> 02:01:35.250
And yet
you still hold my arm.

1667
02:01:36.041 --> 02:01:37.958
And yet I still hold your arm.

1668
02:02:18.250 --> 02:02:19.291
Sherlock Holmes?

1669
02:02:20.166 --> 02:02:21.291
Yes.

1670
02:02:22.166 --> 02:02:23.583
I'm here for my appointment.

1671
02:02:25.458 --> 02:02:26.458
You're seeking a flatmate?

1672
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.125
-You must have the wrong address.
-Really?

1673
02:02:32.958 --> 02:02:35.958
The young lady was very clear
as to the place a-and the time.

1674
02:02:37.208 --> 02:02:39.166
-"Thursday at- 00." she said.

1675
02:02:39.250 --> 02:02:41.000
-You are Sherlock Holmes?
-Hm.

1676
02:02:42.708 --> 02:02:43.541
Yes.

1677
02:02:44.791 --> 02:02:46.791
Please. do come in. Mr…?

1678
02:02:46.875 --> 02:02:47.708
Doctor.

1679
02:02:48.791 --> 02:02:49.625
Watson.

1680
02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:51.625
John Watson.

1681
02:04:18.041 --> 02:04:18.958
{\an8}

1682
02:04:19.041 --> 02:04:21.500
{\an8}
