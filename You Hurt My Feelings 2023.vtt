00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.990
Jonathan... Hello?
Oh. my God...

4
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.730
What are you
actually looking at?

5
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.430
-What?
-I mean.

6
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.600
when I'm talking to you.

7
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.840
What. the rug?

8
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.670
The wall?
What is it? What?

9
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.340
See? When I talk to him
he doesn't look at me.

10
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.380
Is there a reason you're
not looking at Carolyn?

11
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.610
I thought I was.

12
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.010
What. do you have eyes on
the side of your head?

13
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.980
-This is how I listen.
-Oh... I didn't know.

14
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.850
Okay. this is how
I concentrate. okay?

15
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.020
I mean. how long
have you fucking known me?

16
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.590
-This is how I look. Whatever.
-No. you don't.

17
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.390
Carolyn. maybe if Jonathan
repeats back to you

18
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.360
what you've said. would
that help you to feel heard?

19
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.930
No. I don't need him to repeat
back to me what I just said.

20
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.500
I need him to fucking
look at me.

21
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.100
Look at me.

22
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.600
Turn your head
and look at me.

23
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.440
Oh. it's funny. I guess.
it's really funny.

24
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.440
Is that so hard?

25
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.610
Don't tell me what to do.
And do not point at me. okay?

26
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.480
For some reason he doesn't
like me to point at him.

27
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.920
Yeah. for some reason.

28
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.990
Imagine. Imagine this all day.

29
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.390
Imagine. Hey! Imagine it.

30
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.820
Maybe you should talk
to him about his mother.

31
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.060
Did your mom point at you

32
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.090
when you were a little kid.
is that why?

33
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.630
My mom has been
dead for less than a week.

34
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.460
You're such
a fucking bitch.

35
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.930
I'm a fucking bitch?

36
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.760
-Did you hear that?
-Yeah.

37
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.000
-I'm a fucking bitch.
-Yes. Yeah.

38
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.700
That's what I am.
Me. I'm a bitch.

39
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.740
The one who does everything
for you all the time.

40
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.500
-Don. Don.
-All the time.

41
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.640
-Don.
-Yeah Don. you fix it.

42
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.770
Fix it. Make it better for
him. He can't do it by himself.

43
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.080
Don. You want to
intervene here?

44
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.150
I mean. we can
do this at home.

45
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.880
Um...

46
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.090
Well. both of you know a more
productive way to communicate.

47
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.450
So how about... yeah.

48
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.860
with a little less contempt

49
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.690
and some more
honest feelings.

50
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.460
Okay. here's a more
honest feeling. Um...

51
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.860
We've been coming here
a long time

52
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.000
and nothing changes.

53
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.140
You know what.
Jonathan?

54
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.970
Leave him alone
he looks tired.

55
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.710
You do.

56
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.460
I was on my way
to class.

57
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.030
I thought I'd drop by
and say hi. So. hi.

58
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.600
We got in a new strain. You
want to try? Very mellow.

59
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.940
-No.
-Mom.

60
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.500
You smoke weed. I work
in a weed store. Take it.

61
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.940
I'm not going to
buy pot from you.

62
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.980
You go to that place
that's a total rip-off.

63
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.480
-I do not.
-You do.

64
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.610
Okay. I don't want to
talk about this.

65
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.150
You can buy it from me.

66
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.450
Oh. no thank you.

67
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.690
Jesus. I just... I hate you're
working here. It's dangerous.

68
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.020
We have security.

69
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.790
Him?

70
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.020
Can I have a donut?

71
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.130
Ah... okay. they're for
my students though--

72
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.630
they're for my... student...

73
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.230
-Cool. Thanks. Mom.
-These...

74
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.100
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

75
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.640
So. how's the writing going?

76
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.070
It's going?

77
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.310
I can't wait.

78
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.080
Yeah. well. don't
get too excited.

79
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.280
I don't know if it's
any good or not.

80
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.780
Are you kidding me?
It's gonna be amazing.

81
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.650
I love you so much.
I got to go. okay?

82
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.080
- I love you. Bye.
- Bye.

83
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.020
Wake up.

84
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.260
So you're a writer?

85
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.490
You never said.

86
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.530
Well. trying to be.

87
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.900
I know how it is.
I'm an executive producer.

88
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.600
I wanna write about this man
on the street who came up to me

89
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.740
and said that his car had a flat
and that he needed to change

90
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.110
out of his nice clothes
to change the tire.

91
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.080
So he asked me
to stand guard

92
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.810
while he changed out of the nice
clothes so nobody would see him.

93
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.980
-And I--
-That happened to me. too.

94
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.620
- Really?
- And how old were you?

95
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.220
-Nine.
-Okay.

96
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.650
I don't understand.
So what?

97
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.290
He took off his pants

98
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.230
and started masturbating
while staring at me.

99
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.160
That's disgusting.

100
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.630
I am horrified

101
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.870
that that happened to you.
Ivy and to you Marielle.

102
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.800
But it's very compelling

103
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.100
to write about something
so personal. for sure.

104
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.610
Absolutely.

105
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.540
Billy. do you have anything
you'd like to share?

106
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.110
Oh. yeah. Okay. uh...

107
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.810
So. I knew this girl once
who talked too much.

108
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.050
Uh... It drove me crazy.

109
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.820
And one day.
a bee flew in her mouth

110
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.950
and I thought it
was hysterical

111
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.950
and just so perfectly poetic.

112
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.860
Uh... I literally thought.

113
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.690
"Thank God! Maybe now
she'll actually shut up."

114
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.730
But then she had
an allergic reaction and died.

115
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.730
Oh. wow.
I didn't see that coming.

116
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.870
That is... That's terrible.

117
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.270
Right there. in front
of you this happened?

118
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.710
Uh. in the hospital.
But it was pretty awful.

119
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.740
And I wanna write
about that day.

120
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.280
Because of the guilt
I have from laughing.

121
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.980
I just felt so terrible.

122
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.380
Well. I think that that
has the potential

123
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.750
to be a very moving story.

124
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.890
What if you want to write
about somebody who's not dead

125
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.260
but it's not very
nice about them.

126
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.690
To tell you the truth.
I say just...

127
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.660
write your heart out
and don't show it to them.

128
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.870
Really. yeah.

129
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.240
Um. what kind of story
were you thinking about. Hal?

130
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.970
Something in a prison.

131
00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.910
Oh. all right.

132
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.080
And what about a prison
specifically interests you?

133
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.110
Jail?

134
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.980
For sure.

135
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.350
Gosh. guys.
what a productive class.

136
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.120
I can't get over we've
got such a good group.

137
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.660
Give yourself a hand.

138
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.690
Yeah. I love it.
Fantastic.

139
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.400
I think you're done.

140
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.300
You must be so sick of
reading it.

141
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.370
Not at all. Beth.

142
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.240
It's wonderful. honey. really.

143
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.800
Yeah. but then why the hell
haven't I heard from Sylvia?

144
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.370
Maybe it's bad. Maybe it's
not as good as my memoir.

145
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.370
You wrote a great book.

146
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.180
And believe me.
she's going to call you.

147
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.680
She probably just.
you know.

148
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.150
hasn't read it yet.
that's all.

149
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.380
Really?

150
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.380
-Yeah. I'm sure of it
-Wish my memoir did better.

151
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.920
-Why do you think it didn't?
-Sweetheart.

152
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:48.320
Trust me.

153
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.060
your memoir was great.

154
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.990
Your new book is great.

155
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.190
Okay. she's going to love it.

156
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.230
Oh. it's Eliot.
Should we have invited him?

157
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.770
Honey. it's our anniversary.

158
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.770
-We'll call him back.
-Yeah. right.

159
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.440
Come here.

160
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.180
Hmm.

161
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.680
-Okay. so...
-Okay.

162
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.880
You're a good kisser.

163
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.680
-You always have been.
-Thank you.

164
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.350
-Happy Anniversary.
-Ooh.

165
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.420
Well. for goodness sakees.

166
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.150
What do we got here?

167
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.920
-Ooh. a little box.
-Yeah.

168
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.960
-Oh. wow!
-You like?

169
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.100
It's so pretty.

170
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:31.800
-I love them.
-Well.

171
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.100
-they're leaves.
-Yeah... You know me.

172
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.400
Yeah. They look great.

173
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.200
Yeah. Okay.

174
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.400
Love them.

175
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:41.940
Uh-oh.

176
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:43.280
Happy Anniversary.

177
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.440
Oh. wow. Look at this.

178
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.280
Oh.

179
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.190
-A V-neck.
-Yeah.

180
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.220
-Oh. wow. it is soft.
-It's so soft. right?

181
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.720
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

182
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.870
-Hey.
-Hey. We're so lucky.

183
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.270
-Yeah. We are.
-Yeah.

184
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.390
Hi.
How can I help you?

185
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.990
I'm just looking
for a sweater.

186
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.330
Maybe you have
a red one?

187
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.430
A red one. Okay. hang
on. Let me just check.

188
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.040
Are you twins?

189
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.010
Twins? Uh. we're sisters.

190
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.580
She's my much.
much older sister.

191
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.310
like 25 years
or something.

192
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.050
Hey.
what about this one?

193
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.320
Yeah?

194
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.580
Oh. that looks
so adorable on you.

195
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.150
I love the red.

196
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.860
-Thank you.
-Enjoy it.

197
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.530
Don't call old
people adorable.

198
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.230
She was adorable.

199
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.470
No. babies are
adorable. right?

200
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.270
Yeah.

201
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.200
-God. this makes me so sad.
-I know.

202
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.070
Hi. Come on up.

203
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.410
-How can we help you?
-Hey. sweetie.

204
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.580
Do you have some
black pants?

205
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.050
Black pants. Okay. so you look
like you're about a 27 or 28.

206
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.380
Okay. I'll look and see.

207
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.450
And some boots.

208
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.120
Oh. it's only one
item a day.

209
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.990
But you can
come back tomorrow.

210
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.420
Yeah. I can't come back
tomorrow. you stupid shit.

211
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.430
What a shame.

212
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.560
How about these?

213
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.130
Do you like these?

214
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.960
-Yeah.
-Yeah. she likes them.

215
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.570
Okay. Bye.

216
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:48.900
Bye.

217
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.470
What? Why are you so mean?

218
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.110
She called me
a stupid shit.

219
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.870
This is so rewarding. isn't it?

220
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.980
I know. it's really
great to give back. Hi.

221
00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.550
I don't want
to help him out.

222
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.910
He's never helped me.
so why should I help him?

223
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.620
I imagine your siblings
feel differently.

224
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.250
since...
since they are helping.

225
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.960
I don't know. man. maybe
they're just nicer than me.

226
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.190
They're pissed
I'm not doing anything.

227
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.030
You know. they're
taking him to doctors

228
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.630
and clipping his
fucking toenails.

229
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.230
Jim. we haven't been
working together very long.

230
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.440
But. um. yeah. I'm hoping that
we... we can begin exploring

231
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.970
your relationship
with your father.

232
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.340
You're not listening to me.

233
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.580
My dad was a prick.

234
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.410
Still is.

235
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:34.450
There's nothing.

236
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.550
I just don't like
everyone else being mad at me.

237
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.550
Me. my brother.
my sister. we're close.

238
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.160
Hmm. Do you know
that they're mad at you?

239
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.660
Yeah. I can tell.

240
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.630
Anyway.
it doesn't matter.

241
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.160
I'm not gonna change my mind.

242
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.530
So. let them do it
if they want to.

243
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.530
And do they want to?

244
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.970
I don't fucking know.

245
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.540
Okay that... Um. that's
the end of our session.

246
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.580
Um. are the...

247
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.680
I would... I'd like to
continue this next week.

248
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.220
-Sure. Thanks. Don.
-You take care.

249
00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.420
God. he's an idiot.

250
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.960
So. what do you think?

251
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.700
Sorry.

252
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.670
Oh. okay.
Yeah. well. good.

253
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.130
I mean.
that's what I'm here for.

254
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.600
So. any reason
in particular?

255
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.440
It's just.
I don't know. Basic.

256
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.580
Yes. Yeah. well. it is.

257
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.180
It's simple. It's classic.

258
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.240
-True.
-Yeah.

259
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.350
But it doesn't
really say anything.

260
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.180
Yeah. No. you're right.
It doesn't...

261
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.220
It doesn't say anything.

262
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.620
Wait. What? Wait. I'm sorry.

263
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.320
Oh. this was a bad choice.
Okay. I heard you.

264
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.120
Okay.

265
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:56.030
No. I'm. but... I got it. Okay.

266
00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.030
I just think you could
work someplace better.

267
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.400
you know. 'cause you're smart.
You've got a degree.

268
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.730
So does everybody else.

269
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.600
He's 23 years old. where
else should he be working?

270
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.440
I just think you could
find something

271
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.240
that's more on par
with your abilities

272
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.510
'cause you're talented. El.

273
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.150
Well. who's to say?

274
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.310
-I say. Yeah.
-I say. We both say.

275
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.620
You guys haven't
even read what I've written.

276
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.180
What? Are you kidding me?

277
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.020
Come on. I know it's
going to be wonderful.

278
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:21.420
When do you think
it will be finished?

279
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.660
Absolutely no idea.

280
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.590
Can I get a bit more salad?

281
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.560
Yeah. That?

282
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:28.560
Thank you. honey.

283
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.300
Why don't you guys
get your own food?

284
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.700
We like to share.

285
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.230
Why does that bother you?

286
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440
How is Alison?

287
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.570
Uh. she's good.
Yeah. I think.

288
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.440
Um...

289
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.580
Yeah. she's working a lot.

290
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.710
Sometimes I feel
like she's...

291
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.320
Pulling away.
I don't know.

292
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.190
-Oh. sweetie...
-She's just on me about my job

293
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.620
because there's no way to grow
or make more money.

294
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.530
Maybe you two should see
a therapist together.

295
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.560
We're 23.

296
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.300
Listen. it's...
it's never too early.

297
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.640
Okay. we'll figure it out.
Uh. never mind.

298
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.770
Well. you'd better.

299
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.600
She pays half the rent.

300
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.840
Okay. well. that's not what he
needs to hear right now. Don.

301
00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.110
What?

302
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.780
You know. I think I taught
you to ride your bike here.

303
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.410
-Right here?
-Yeah.

304
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.510
with the training wheels.

305
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.750
-You remember that?
-Oh. yeah.

306
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.720
I think it was here.

307
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.350
Yeah. that was fun.
You're a good teacher.

308
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.450
-Oh. nice.
-How about that?

309
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.830
-It's good. yeah? Mm-hmm.
-That's really good.

310
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:35.090
You're sharing
an ice cream cone?

311
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.430
Yeah. you want some?

312
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.500
Uh. no. thank you.

313
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.600
-Try it. it's peanut butter.
-I got to go.

314
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.600
It's... I'm good.

315
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.440
-Thanks for lunch.
-Yeah.

316
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.470
-You're welcome.
-See you later.

317
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.770
-Love you.
-Love you. too.

318
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.640
-Yeah. have fun.
-Have a good one.

319
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.180
Here. have some more.

320
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.120
-Don't take the whole thing.
-No?

321
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.690
You're gonna fall
asleep. honey.

322
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.320
Fat chance of that.
I'm so nervous.

323
00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:08.830
- Look at these things.
- I mean...

324
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.800
Do humans even live here?

325
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.500
How do you
plug anything in?

326
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.500
Hey. how do I look?

327
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.840
Cute. adorable.

328
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.570
-My hands are so clammy.
-You're gonna do great.

329
00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.110
-Go get 'em.
-Uh...

330
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.710
Oh. fuck you.

331
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.580
It's so tiring.

332
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.680
He makes me feel
like I do everything wrong.

333
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.690
Can you give me an example?

334
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.650
He wants me to turn on
the water when I pee.

335
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.160
so he can't hear it
through the door.

336
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.590
Once. I left the door open
and he got mad.

337
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.590
And why does he care?
I hear him pee all the time.

338
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:43.600
It doesn't bother me.

339
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.430
And he gets annoyed
when I buy him things.

340
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.870
He acts like he doesn't care
about material things.

341
00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.900
but he does.

342
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:50.370
He has an Apple Watch.

343
00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.940
And you buy him things
out of love or affection?

344
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.370
-Yes.
-Is that... Yeah.

345
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.480
You know what I bought him?
A beanie.

346
00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.410
because he lost his.

347
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.210
He says. I don't listen.
A beanie.

348
00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.650
And it was from H&M!

349
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.220
Um. does all this sound at
all familiar to you. Frankie?

350
00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.690
I don't think so.
What do you mean?

351
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.890
Well. his behavior reminds me
of someone else in your life.

352
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.290
-Who?
-Your father.

353
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.660
My father?

354
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.570
Yeah. Do you see
the similarities?

355
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.200
Like his criticism of you?

356
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.540
Not me. must be thinking
of somebody else.

357
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.640
My dad
is the sweetest person.

358
00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.610
He's only been
really loving toward me.

359
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.880
Ah. of course.

360
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.620
I apologize. That's...

361
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:40.690
No. it's okay.

362
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.220
I'm sure you see
so many people.

363
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.760
No. that's-- that's--
that's not okay.

364
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.860
Um...

365
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:47.760
Okay. um...

366
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.800
Let's. uh... Let's go on.

367
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.430
God. whatever happened
to regular coffee shops

368
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.470
with their red booths
and the perfect tuna?

369
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.670
Ooh. did you want
to go somewhere else?

370
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.770
No. but you
know what I mean.

371
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.880
You know. with the the filthy
menus and the mean people.

372
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.410
Well. I really like it here.

373
00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:08.250
There's a real one
left on Madison.

374
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.020
Actually. I used to go there
when I went to the doctor.

375
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.420
But then my doctor died.

376
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:12.580
so I don't go there anymore.

377
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.520
Isn't that a weird thing.
when your doctor dies?

378
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:16.960
So. how's Eliot?

379
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.460
-How old is he now?
-He's 23.

380
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.030
Yeah. he's working
in a pot store.

381
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.800
-He's the manager.
-Well. that's very legit.

382
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:26.030
Mm-hmm.

383
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.970
Uh. he's...
he's working on a play.

384
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.230
Oh. he's a writer?

385
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:30.940
Well. it's his first.
I haven't read it yet. though.

386
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.640
-But...
-Well. that's a brave move.

387
00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.510
Having a successful writer
as your mother.

388
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.380
Speaking of which...

389
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.680
Okay. so I'll start by saying
what you already know.

390
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.750
I love your work.
and the book is good.

391
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.550
-Of course.
-Uh-oh.

392
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:53.560
I-- I just don't feel
it's as strong as your memoir.

393
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:55.290
Um...

394
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.400
Okay. but it's a different thing
'cause it's a work of fiction.

395
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:00.830
Look. it's rough out there.

396
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.940
There's a lot of competition.
a lot of stories to tell.

397
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.270
lots of new voices.

398
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.610
Mm. I'm an old voice.

399
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.840
No. you're competing
with writers of all ethnicities.

400
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.550
refugees. cancer.
murder. abuse.

401
00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.580
-I had abuse.
-Verbal abuse.

402
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.950
It was still abuse.

403
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.550
Of course. it was. And you
wrote about it beautifully.

404
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.960
-Thank you. Yeah.
-Mmm.

405
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.890
Look. it's your first
work of fiction.

406
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.860
Why not try another draft?

407
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.730
She said I wasn't
a new voice.

408
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.770
- You're the best voice.
- An old voice.

409
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:39.970
I'm not that old.

410
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.880
Didn't you say that. uh...

411
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.510
that other agent was chasing
you a while ago?

412
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.610
-Oh. yeah. Vince something.
-Yeah.

413
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.620
Yeah. well...
Send it to him.

414
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.590
Yeah. I guess I will.

415
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.060
What are you doing?

416
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.060
I don't know.
This looks better.

417
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.670
Only less tired.

418
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.840
Less tired and horrifying.

419
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.470
Well. you know.
women do it all the time.

420
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.940
It's such a double standard.

421
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.610
I...

422
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.410
I look tired.
I'm... I'm aging.

423
00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:23.720
What are ya. nuts?

424
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.120
Well. you get Botox.

425
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.960
Well. I just get
a little bit right here.

426
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.020
You know. I can still move
my eyebrows. Watch. watch.

427
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.130
Oh. yeah. so expressive.

428
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.730
Since when are you so vain?

429
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.630
I don't know. I was...
I was young and hot.

430
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.070
Well. you're still
younger than me.

431
00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:51.140
She's doing
a lot better I think.

432
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.680
Oh.
I don't know about that.

433
00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.710
Okay
try hard. all right.

434
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.180
Let's just have it
be nice today.

435
00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.020
I'll be nice.
You be nice.

436
00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.950
We'll both be nice.

437
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.790
- Mama!
- Hi.

438
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.420
Hi. How are you?

439
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.660
I'm good. how are you?

440
00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.030
Okay.

441
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.030
-Hi. Ma.
-Hi.

442
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.600
Good to see ya.

443
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:14.670
And you.

444
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.940
Ooh. this looks so yummy.

445
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.070
-Wow.
-A little spread.

446
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:20.870
Oh. you look cute.

447
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.780
I'm not cute.

448
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.640
I'm a mature woman.

449
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.010
- It was a compliment.
- When did you see Beetlejuice?

450
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.780
What beetle?

451
00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.550
The. the. the show.

452
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.820
What is that?

453
00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.620
It's a Playbill.

454
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:35.050
From Beetlejuice?

455
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.590
-Yeah.
-Oh.

456
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.930
I didn't see that show.

457
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:40.990
Oh.

458
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.130
Okay.

459
00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.870
Does she want you
to keep working at it or what?

460
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.900
I don't know. maybe... No.

461
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.200
She doesn't get you.

462
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.040
You need someone
who gets you.

463
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.740
Well. she used to get me.

464
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.780
Did she?

465
00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.510
She didn't help when
it came to your memoir.

466
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:59.710
What do you mean?

467
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.510
-She got it published.
-It could have done better.

468
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.990
First of all.
that's not her job.

469
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.160
And second of all.
it did okay. you know.

470
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.590
It did better than okay.

471
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.660
- Yeah.
- It should have done better.

472
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.530
Well. maybe if Dad hadn't
just been verbally abusive.

473
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.830
it would've been
a bestseller.

474
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:20.830
-What?
-Yeah.

475
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:21.830
What is the
matter with you?

476
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.040
Don't say that.

477
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.240
Why don't you grow up?

478
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.170
Anyway. Look. I'm sending the
new book to another agent. so.

479
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.640
Good.

480
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.980
Okay. so what have
you been up to. Mom?

481
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.480
Physical therapy.
Netflix.

482
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.050
-TMC.
-No. TCM.

483
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.020
Why would it be called
The Channel Movie?

484
00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.250
It's The Movie Channel.

485
00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.060
Turner Classic Movies.

486
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.060
- No kidding?
- Mm-hmm...

487
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.490
Yep. True story.

488
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.760
Oh. I meant TMZ.

489
00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.600
No. you didn't.

490
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.070
I don't fucking know.
There's so many channels.

491
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.170
Oh. hey. Mom. while we're here.

492
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.200
do you have any
good giveaways for us?

493
00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.740
You always ask me that.

494
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.870
Yes. because we volunteer
at the church.

495
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.640
I don't know if
I have anything.

496
00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.310
Well. do you think
you could check?

497
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.550
-I'm standing up.
-Great.

498
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.750
You shouldn't volunteer.

499
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.280
you both spread
yourselves too thin.

500
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.090
Why don't you volunteer
and do things for me?

501
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.260
You're fine.

502
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.960
-I'm not fine.
-Uh-huh.

503
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.860
Is she jealous of the homeless?

504
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.060
Yeah. she is. because they got
everything going for them.

505
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.160
so I suppose so.
Oh. yeah.

506
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.270
-That might work.
-All right. so...

507
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.270
Yeah. that's good.

508
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.630
But I don't know if
anybody would want it.

509
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.900
because it's an awful color.

510
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.040
No. this is good.

511
00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.070
-Yup.
-And here's this.

512
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.040
Yes.
Somebody will love this.

513
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:37.980
- Cute.
- Oh.

514
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.080
I changed my mind about
this one. forget it.

515
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.780
-No. this is too nice.
-What are you talking about?

516
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.750
Why'd you bring it out? How
many times have you worn it?

517
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.690
Maybe once. But it's good.
not for the homeless.

518
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.190
Well. they appreciate
nice stuff. you know.

519
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.190
Mm-hmm.
- Here. fine take it.

520
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.830
- Give it to the homeless.
- Great.

521
00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.300
-Hey. Ma.
-What?

522
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.130
This potato salad is so good.

523
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.870
Can I take some of it
home with me?

524
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.940
Oh. please. I have
plenty. I have too much.

525
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.310
Take some tin foil.

526
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.380
What?

527
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.650
That... I was gonna just
put it in one of these things.

528
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.080
You got. like.
3.000 of them.

529
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.650
No. no.
just wrap it in tin foil.

530
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.820
Aw. that's hilarious.

531
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.990
I'm not going
to put potato salad...

532
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.330
In tin foil. Mom.

533
00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.930
That is just...
That's totally gross.

534
00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.000
It's crazy.

535
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.900
-Mom.
-Yes?

536
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.000
You cannot be
that crazy lady.

537
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.110
I'm not a crazy lady.

538
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.880
And I'm not a lady.
None of us are ladies.

539
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.080
We are women
and this is my house.

540
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.950
And don't take
the potato salad.

541
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.750
I'm saving it for tomorrow.

542
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.950
Sounds good.

543
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.650
Is lunch over?

544
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.290
The part is kind
of strange actually.

545
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.320
-It's interesting.
-Yeah.

546
00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.930
It's interesting... I can't even
believe I got this part. really.

547
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.900
I'm just ready to get started.
you know. I'm a little...

548
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:03.960
-I'm a little nervous.
-Yeah.

549
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.230
-So. when are they?
-Rehearsals start tomorrow.

550
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:07.430
Okay. straight in.

551
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.700
And you know. I think it's
going to be a real challenge

552
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.100
because all the other...

553
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.870
Everyone else is. like. an
established theater actor.

554
00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.010
Yeah.

555
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.380
You know. and I'm a little...
Anyway I'm just nervous.

556
00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.450
-Anyway. how are you?
-Okay.

557
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.850
-Yeah.
-Any new crazies?

558
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.020
No new ones. no.
I don't know.

559
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.280
I'm feeling kind of
off my game.

560
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.750
Oh. really.
What do you mean?

561
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.960
I don't know...
my crazies are fine.

562
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.860
Actually. I shouldn't call
them that. Do you mind if...

563
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.130
-No. Of course.
-Because...

564
00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.400
Oh. before I forget. Sarah is
throwing me a birthday dinner.

565
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.830
-We need you guys there.
-Yeah.

566
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.330
-Yeah.
-How old are you?

567
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.070
I don't know.

568
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.800
I'll take Mom over going sock
shopping with Mark any day.

569
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.270
He's going to be
in Paragon

570
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.710
-for. like. three hours.
-What?

571
00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.180
I think he got Don
to go with him.

572
00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.810
That's too funny. Mark
cares that much about socks?

573
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:55.280
-He does. Yeah.
-Wow.

574
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.420
Should I be buying
better socks?

575
00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:58.950
Well. you know. he can
talk to you all about it.

576
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.950
About how the cheap ones

577
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:02.290
are very different
from the good ones.

578
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.920
and he's always getting rid
of old ones to buy new ones.

579
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.330
He even throws
away his underwear.

580
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.300
-Well. don't you?
-No.

581
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.700
Never?

582
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.900
I'm gonna take you over to
the wall. I call it the wall.

583
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.800
It's got everything that you
need. Every texture. every idea.

584
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.900
- Okay.
- Hey!

585
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:20.970
Hey.

586
00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:22.270
Didn't I see you
in that pumpkin movie?

587
00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.480
-Yes.
-Wow.

588
00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.210
-Hey. how are you?
-Such a funny movie.

589
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.910
Aw. thank you.
thank you.

590
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.010
You want to do a selfie?

591
00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.720
Oh. uh. that's okay.

592
00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.950
-Thanks. though.
-Yeah.

593
00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.860
-This is my life.
-Er. what pumpkin movie?

594
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.330
It's this movie I did about
10 years ago.

595
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.490
Did you play a pumpkin?

596
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.160
No. that was the lead.

597
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.030
I wish I got the dip.

598
00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:49.000
Let's go to Paragon.
I bet they're still in there.

599
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:49.970
What?

600
00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:51.970
No way. How many socks
do they have in there?

601
00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:53.770
You'll see.
I'm telling ya.

602
00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:02.820
I'm not rushing.

603
00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:04.850
Me neither.

604
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.420
That wasn't worth it.

605
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.390
We're finished.

606
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.320
-He cares.
-Yeah.

607
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.130
-Oh. You know what?
-What?

608
00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.130
When Eliot was 16. he stole
something from here once.

609
00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.830
He got in really
big trouble too.

610
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:19.900
Oh. of course he did.

611
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.000
-Ping pong balls.
-Well...

612
00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.270
-Those are extremely expensive.
-Yeah.

613
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.140
Look.

614
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.980
You were right.

615
00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.480
I wonder if they've
even moved.

616
00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.450
Do you think they're
paralyzed?

617
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.550
More like frozen.

618
00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:36.920
No. Look.
one of them moved.

619
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.550
-We'll go sneak up on them.
-Mm.

620
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:42.090
You think?

621
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.590
If I say even the slightest
thing. she falls apart.

622
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.030
I thought that
you liked her writing.

623
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:49.530
I do. generally. but I...
I don't like this new book.

624
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.860
And this is a memoir?

625
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.170
No. no. she's. uh...
she's written a novel.

626
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.200
It's fiction.

627
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.610
It's kind of a...
kind of a mystery.

628
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.140
Yeah. I don't know. I
don't know what it is.

629
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.070
We should go. Beth.

630
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.580
I just feel stuck. and I
just... I don't know what to do.

631
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.010
Does that make sense?
I don't know.

632
00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:09.850
Oh. shit. man. Can you
say anything?

633
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.880
No. I can't.

634
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.120
I can't. I could have.
maybe should have.

635
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:14.920
you know. like. second.
third. twentieth read.

636
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.520
- Twentieth read?
- Yeah. Yeah.

637
00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:17.960
Draft after draft after draft.

638
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.490
she was asking for notes
and I didn't know how to.

639
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.060
And now it feels too late.

640
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.160
-And it's no good?
-Not to me.

641
00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.200
Oh. my God!

642
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.200
-Wait. Beth. Beth...
-Oh. my God!

643
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.300
I think they were talking
about something else.

644
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.370
I can't believe this.

645
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.570
No. I mean. maybe we
misheard.

646
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.170
I think I'm gonna be sick.

647
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.940
Oh. no. you are?

648
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:36.940
Yeah. I think I'm
gonna throw up.

649
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.880
Okay. wait. right over there--

650
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.380
Right there is a...
Oh. God. right here?

651
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:45.120
Oh. God. Oh!

652
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.990
No. I don't think I can.
I can't.

653
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.890
He loves you more
than life itself.

654
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.520
What does that have to do
with anything here?

655
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.490
I'm saying that he doesn't
love your book. okay?

656
00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.230
He doesn't love your book.
I mean. who cares?

657
00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:58.330
Do you understand
I've been working on this book

658
00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.130
-for two years. right?
-Uh-huh.

659
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.240
I've given him. like.
a million drafts to read.

660
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.970
and every time he reads it.
every single time.

661
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.510
he tells me
how much he loves it.

662
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.340
Every single time!

663
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.410
Because he just doesn't like.
you know.

664
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.080
get it or whatever.

665
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.410
And now
my hands have gone numb.

666
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:15.580
-Yeah. take a...
-For real.

667
00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:16.650
Okay. can you take
a deep breath?

668
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.520
I am breathing. Sarah.

669
00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.550
All right. would you just...
You're going to talk to him.

670
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.090
Well. that's a joke.

671
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.230
I am never gonna be able to
look him in the face ever again.

672
00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.630
Okay. that's over.

673
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.130
And I did some things
that are good.

674
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.370
I mean. I won that thing
for the piece

675
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.470
in the Atlantic.

676
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.170
That was...
that was really good.

677
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.510
And all the articles
and all the essays.

678
00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.240
you know. I mean. he probably
thinks it's just crazy

679
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.540
that I even teach.
you know.

680
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.580
Oh God.
what about my memoir?

681
00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:49.980
Oh!

682
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.650
He probably thinks it's bad.

683
00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.450
Oh. my God.
this whole time...

684
00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.360
It's about you.
how could he think that?

685
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.220
How could he possibly
respect me?

686
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.260
Of course. he respects you.

687
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.600
No. not if he doesn't
like my work.

688
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.300
You know that.

689
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.600
He's probably been lying
to me this whole time.

690
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.200
-No. there's just no way.
-He's a liar.

691
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.110
What a prick. too.

692
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.510
You know. that he doesn't
think that I could take it.

693
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.580
Like. that alone
is so insulting.

694
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:22.010
Beth. he loves you. even if
he doesn't like your book.

695
00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.580
I just need his approval.

696
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:30.090
-Of all people.
-Well. let me read it.

697
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.690
Uh. it's okay.
You don't read.

698
00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.160
Am I in it?

699
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.160
No.

700
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.130
You know what?

701
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.270
Like. Mark
isn't always great. okay?

702
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.070
I mean. as an actor.
it kind of depends on the role.

703
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.440
Why are you whispering?

704
00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.440
Is he hiding under the couch?

705
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.610
I'm just saying he's not
always good. you know.

706
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.550
and I think that's kind of
the same thing.

707
00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.450
But sometimes
you think he's good.

708
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.420
Yeah. definitely.

709
00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.020
So. the times when you
don't think he's good.

710
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.360
-what do you say to him?
-That he's good.

711
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.690
Well. what if he found out
that you were lying?

712
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.060
He'd croak.

713
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.130
Well. I want to croak.

714
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.100
You gonna be okay?

715
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.540
-No. never.
-Oh.

716
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.270
Just out of my mind.

717
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.140
All right. well.
I'll call you later.

718
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.540
-You going home now?
-Yeah.

719
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:25.010
Talk to him.

720
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.680
-I love you.
-Okay.

721
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.220
I think there's a way
to tell if they've gone bad.

722
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.290
Hmm. there is.

723
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.790
You put them in water
and you see if they float.

724
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:39.730
Does that mean they're good
or they're bad?

725
00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.360
Uh...

726
00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.660
Bad. I think.

727
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.430
I'm not sure.
Let me look it up.

728
00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.430
No. don't look it up now.

729
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:46.470
I'll just throw them out.

730
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.600
You're always looking things up.

731
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.500
Excuse me for a second.
I'm sorry for the interruption.

732
00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:53.410
but I was just wondering.
what do you do two...

733
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.240
What do you two
do for a living?

734
00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.740
-Why?
-I don't know.

735
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.280
I was just kind of curious.

736
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.480
You look like you do
interesting things or something.

737
00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.220
Um. I'm a flower designer
and she's a painter.

738
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.250
Okay. cool. Yeah.

739
00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.820
And so. do you like
your friend's paintings?

740
00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:13.790
Well. she's my wife.

741
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.100
-And yes.
-Mm-hmm. okay.

742
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.400
And do you...
you like her...

743
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.630
I mean. your wife's
flower designs.

744
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.400
Why are you asking
all these questions?

745
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.470
Aren't you going
to answer her?

746
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:31.610
Uh. yes. my wife's floral
arrangements are nice.

747
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.580
She always says
they're too controlled.

748
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.180
No. no. they're not always.

749
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:37.420
You know nice
is not a nice word.

750
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.250
Well. you've called my
paintings pleasing.

751
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.720
- That's worse.
- Never have I ever

752
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.450
used that word
to describe your work.

753
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.220
No. you just
used it last week.

754
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:04.240
Shit for brains.
Shit for brains.

755
00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.380
Shit for brains.

756
00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.280
Shit for brains.
Shit for brains.

757
00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:13.750
Shit for brains.

758
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.620
Oh. fuck.
Shit for brains.

759
00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:19.830
Are you kidding me?

760
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.330
Every word.

761
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.200
Why would you do that?

762
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.400
What? We just...
We were just playing around.

763
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.670
We came in to say hi.

764
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.240
Wait. does Don know?

765
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.300
I don't know.

766
00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.210
But you can't
say anything. okay?

767
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.510
Wow.

768
00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:39.440
Oh. my God. she was so hurt
and she was so embarrassed

769
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.380
and I don't blame her one bit.
I mean.

770
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:43.420
she almost threw up.

771
00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.890
It was like that scene
from An Unmarried Woman.

772
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.690
Huh?

773
00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.790
Never mind.

774
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.160
Would you ever lie to me?

775
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.430
About something like
that. I mean.

776
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:58.900
Like what?

777
00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.800
Like. about my designs
or my taste.

778
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.770
I love your taste.

779
00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:05.440
Thank you.

780
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:22.550
Hello?

781
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.220
Mom?

782
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.260
Eliot. what are
you doing here?

783
00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.930
Honey. what's wrong?

784
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.570
Alison broke up with me.

785
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.370
Oh! Come here.

786
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.840
No.

787
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.410
What happened?

788
00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:45.710
I noticed she was getting
kind of distant.

789
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.350
but I didn't think this was
fucking going to happen.

790
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.620
- Oh.
- I had no idea.

791
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.920
What a cunt!

792
00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.690
Eliot. maybe don't say cunt.

793
00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:57.990
Sorry.

794
00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.930
She must have been unhappy.
I guess.

795
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.430
You're on her side?

796
00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.330
What? No. I just...

797
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.260
I mean.
there must have been a reason.

798
00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:07.900
Anyway. you know.

799
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.270
I'm sure you guys are going
to be able to work this out.

800
00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.440
I know you liked her.

801
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:17.480
I did. I do. you know.
But why. honey?

802
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:19.010
I mean. did she tell you?

803
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.680
She slept with someone else.

804
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:25.420
Oh. wow. honey.

805
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:27.620
Total cunt.

806
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.350
Oh. really?

807
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.390
He called her that first.

808
00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.790
El. I'm so sorry.

809
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.930
That's...
That's really tough.

810
00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.430
You know. affairs happen.

811
00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.870
You know.
you guys can get past this.

812
00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.000
Affairs don't happen.

813
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.870
You guys don't have affairs.

814
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.940
No. but I'm just saying.
you know...

815
00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.310
And you trust each other.
right?

816
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.880
Of course.

817
00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.790
Why aren't you guys
more upset for me?

818
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.660
-We are.
-Yeah. we are.

819
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.590
I'm gonna crash in my old room.
if that's all right.

820
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:10.030
El...

821
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.930
Beth?

822
00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.940
Beth?

823
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.740
Honey. I'm sure that
you're a good boyfriend.

824
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.750
Well. maybe I'm not.
Maybe she's right.

825
00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.450
She cheated on you.

826
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.780
Well. she--
she said she didn't want to.

827
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.420
She felt lonely.

828
00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:35.990
What? No. Eliot.
that's not right.

829
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.390
If she's blaming you
for her cheating...

830
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.960
-She's not.
-She is.

831
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:41.130
That's what you just said.

832
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.130
Okay. I have
to go to sleep.

833
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.030
Somehow. you're making me
feel worse.

834
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.930
Maybe it's a career thing.
you know.

835
00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:49.400
'cause she's cut
from a different cloth.

836
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:51.900
She's on this very ambitious
track to become a lawyer.

837
00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.470
So. now it's because
I'm a loser.

838
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.910
Oh. my God. Eliot.
Are you kidding me?

839
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:58.440
I'm trying to help you
to feel better.

840
00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.980
-I give up.
-Yeah. Good idea.

841
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.650
Wait. Mom.

842
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.720
What?

843
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:05.820
Do we have bagels?

844
00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:08.390
Uh. I don't know.
I'll check.

845
00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.050
Okay. Uh...
What's going on?

846
00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.080
What do you mean?

847
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:37.120
Why did you sleep on the couch?

848
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:39.520
You...
Are you mad at me?

849
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:40.850
I just couldn't sleep.

850
00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.460
You. uh... Are you upset
about Sylvia?

851
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:50.930
You. uh... Did you send it
to that. uh...

852
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.500
That other agent guy?

853
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.000
I'm fine. okay?

854
00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.870
I think she's right.

855
00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:01.070
-The book is bad.
-Sylvia has bad taste.

856
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:03.910
Just... Just send it
to the other guy.

857
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:08.950
What?

858
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.980
Just don't.

859
00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.520
Don't what?

860
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:15.650
Pretend you liked the book.

861
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:20.460
You know. Beth this is
getting kind of tedious.

862
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.760
Yeah. I agree with that.

863
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.460
Do you like the book?

864
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.500
Because. you know.
that is all that matters.

865
00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.500
Well. that's a new take.

866
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.040
-Good morning.
-Morning.

867
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.670
I'm late for class.

868
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.870
I'll see you later.
I love you.

869
00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.640
What's wrong with Mom?

870
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.980
Ah...

871
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:45.050
Honestly. sometimes
I look at some of them

872
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.090
and I just think... I don't know
how to help you.

873
00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.790
I mix up their problems.

874
00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.460
Wait. what do you mean?

875
00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:53.230
No. don't laugh.
sometimes I forget.

876
00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.030
Like... Are you the one
with the dead mother?

877
00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.760
And I can't ask because
I should know.

878
00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.230
-And I do know.
-Dude...

879
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.130
-But I'm just mixing them up.
-You are old.

880
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.630
You need to write
that shit down.

881
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:03.600
No. But I was never like this.

882
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.240
How are... how are things
with you and Beth?

883
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.110
Huh. why?

884
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:09.880
Yeah. I don't know I just...

885
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:12.280
She's acting sort
of cold and weird.

886
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:13.950
Did she say anything to Sarah?

887
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.280
-No. no. I don't know anything.
-Yeah.

888
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.680
I just... She didn't say
why or anything?

889
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.120
No. but it's something.

890
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:24.020
I hate that place. but he
loves it. So we go once a year.

891
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.390
It's okay.

892
00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.560
and we get along pretty
well when we're on vacation.

893
00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:30.100
That's great.
Why do you think that is?

894
00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.800
Well. we're on vacation.

895
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:37.640
Um. well. a lot
of couples fight on vacation.

896
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.640
We don't.

897
00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.780
Sure. Um.

898
00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.050
So. um. yeah.
we're almost out of time.

899
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.680
But I... um. I wanted
to ask you something.

900
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.220
Okay.

901
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.390
Yeah. I guess I just
wanted to check that you're...

902
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.960
You're getting what
you want out of these sessions.

903
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.790
Why are you asking me that?

904
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.260
I'm just. you know.
checking in.

905
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:04.330
Uh. I'm okay.

906
00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.170
Um. I mean. the only
real problem these days

907
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.940
is with my brother and sister.

908
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.140
They're. you know. with my dad.

909
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:13.270
Mm-hmm.

910
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:15.310
They're not
really talking to me.

911
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:18.740
But I'm not
going to feel guilty.

912
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.880
Uh. do you feel guilty?

913
00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.990
I just said no.

914
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.690
Well. um. we'll be sure
to pick that up next week.

915
00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.690
Yeah. we...
We have to stop now.

916
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.160
-Okay.
-Great.

917
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.930
Okay. take care.

918
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.070
Fucking pointless.

919
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:49.940
"Her hands were cold.

920
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.680
"despite the hot. stagnant air
in the ugly room.

921
00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.750
"Visiting hours
were coming to a close.

922
00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.580
"Dads were saying goodbye
to their kids.

923
00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.290
"Evelyn waited a long time for
him to appear.

924
00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.620
"but he never did.

925
00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.990
"He never would."

926
00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.900
Wow. Hal.

927
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:17.400
God. that is really
a surprise...

928
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.140
Just impressive.

929
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.010
I mean. that was lovely.

930
00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.310
It's just a fantastic
first draft.

931
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.110
I said I wanted
to write about prison.

932
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:29.880
Yeah. you did say that.

933
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.420
That was so sad.

934
00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.720
I liked it. too.

935
00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.320
After everybody has read theirs.
we'll dive deeper into it.

936
00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.020
But bravo. Hal. bravo!

937
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.300
Um. so who would like
to read their story next?

938
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.170
I changed my mind
about what I was going to write.

939
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.300
So. I haven't
written anything yet.

940
00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:50.340
-Okay.
-I was writing about that

941
00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:53.810
gross. naked man
and it was bumming me out.

942
00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.280
So. I think I'm going
to write about this trip

943
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:57.840
I took to the zoo
when I was eight.

944
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.810
Okay. was that a happy trip?

945
00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.180
So. we were looking at the
monkeys. me and my mom.

946
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.120
And one of them was looking me

947
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.350
right in the eye
like he hated me.

948
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:10.390
like he was going to jump
out of the cage and kill me.

949
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.290
Then I had
a really bad nosebleed.

950
00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:16.130
so my mom had
to take me home.

951
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.870
Ah. so... No. not a--
Not a happy trip.

952
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:23.300
Sometimes you just have
to get it out though. right?

953
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.870
Yeah. I mean. the title of
my book says that exactly.

954
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.110
What title?

955
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:38.120
-I Had To Tell It.
-You had to tell it?

956
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.350
-No. no. "I Had To".
-You had to tell it.

957
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.290
Oh. no. the title of the
book is I Had To Tell It.

958
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.830
Has nobody in here
read my book?

959
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.430
I didn't know about it.

960
00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.930
I can't imagine that
you would have

961
00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:56.770
trusted me to be your teacher

962
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.940
if you weren't familiar
with my work.

963
00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:01.210
I saw that you were
published and that you

964
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.140
wrote a lot of articles.

965
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.410
I just signed up.

966
00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.380
What's it about?

967
00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.110
Um...

968
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:10.350
It's about my childhood.

969
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.420
It's a memoir.

970
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:14.850
Oh. I read this other memoir
that was really killer.

971
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.890
Which one?

972
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.160
Please And No Thank You.

973
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:19.230
I love that book.

974
00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.290
I also love that.

975
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.190
Oh. I got to read that.

976
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:25.900
But I will definitely
be reading yours.

977
00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:27.970
-Me. too.
-Same.

978
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:29.470
-I'm gonna read that.
-Definitely gonna read that.

979
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.070
I Had To Tell?

980
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:35.440
It. I Had To Tell It.

981
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:37.280
Yeah.
I Had To Tell It. yeah.

982
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:39.380
Yeah. write that one down.

983
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:42.410
Oh. my God. because I keep
telling you. I don't want them.

984
00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:46.010
That's because you eat so
shitty. especially at work.

985
00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:47.450
No. it's... Okay. so.

986
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:49.380
she makes me salads

987
00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.450
to take to work
in these dumb little

988
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.950
-Tupperware things. but
-They're not dumb.

989
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:54.050
-the reason...
-They're recyclable.

990
00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:55.190
Just put it in a fucking baggy.

991
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.290
-It doesn't matter.
-Just...

992
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.190
Can you shut up
and keep talking?

993
00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:00.460
So. the only reason
she makes me a salad

994
00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:02.930
is because she wants me
to lose weight.

995
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.230
-which is passive aggressive.
-No.

996
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.270
No. that is not true. The
reason that I make the salads

997
00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.230
is because I want you
to be healthy.

998
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.500
So. here's how it goes.

999
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.040
I make him a salad. right?

1000
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.440
But then he takes it to work.

1001
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.910
and he puts mozzarella
sticks on top of the salad.

1002
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.010
and then guess what?

1003
00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.950
He doesn't eat the salad.

1004
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.210
Who told you that?

1005
00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:24.250
You know who told me that.

1006
00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:26.490
Great.

1007
00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.390
-Thanks. Naomi.
-Naomi told me that.

1008
00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:32.660
You know.
I don't think you have any idea

1009
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:35.190
how hard I have to work
to stay healthy.

1010
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:36.530
For you.

1011
00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:38.000
For me? Right.

1012
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:39.200
Okay. I'm sorry.

1013
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.630
How healthy is. "Oh. excuse me.

1014
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:45.100
waiter. could we get another
round of skinny margaritas?"

1015
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.510
What is this?
What accent is that?

1016
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.040
-What? Where?
-It's Naomi.

1017
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.380
Naomi's from New Zealand.

1018
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.310
-Yeah.
-That's not New Zealand.

1019
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.110
I think you don't like women.

1020
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.680
I like women.

1021
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:56.320
I do. I like women.

1022
00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.020
I just don't like you.

1023
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:13.900
Sorry.

1024
00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:15.370
Okay. no problem.

1025
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.340
You saw a picture
of this one though. right?

1026
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.510
You can't really tell
in a picture.

1027
00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.610
Okay. Um...

1028
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.480
No problem.
because I have one more.

1029
00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.920
Sorry.

1030
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.640
Excuse me.

1031
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.070
How much is this one?

1032
00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:55.110
Oh. my God.

1033
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.080
Isn't it beautiful?

1034
00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.580
This piece.
which is one of a kind...

1035
00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:04.120
-Yeah. I would assume it is.
-...is $19.000.

1036
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.590
-Huh?
-Oh. thank you so much.

1037
00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:09.320
Beth. shut up.

1038
00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:10.660
-What?
-This is what I do.

1039
00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:12.460
You can't insult these people.

1040
00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:13.990
Not even comfortable.

1041
00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:16.500
A long bench costs
this much?

1042
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.000
Oh. wake up.

1043
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.070
Hey. look at these lights.

1044
00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:29.010
I would never buy this bench.
no matter what.

1045
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.410
-What do you think?
-Uh...

1046
00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.450
Yeah. it's cool.

1047
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:36.580
I mean. it looks like
it's fucking itself.

1048
00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.180
but she'll probably love it.

1049
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:47.630
Are you planning
to come tomorrow night?

1050
00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:51.630
Yeah. really... I-- I don't
think I can. I'm sorry.

1051
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.670
Can you get your feet
off the couch?

1052
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.770
-Please.
-What?

1053
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.100
Really?
What's the matter with you?

1054
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.270
Why haven't you
talked to him yet?

1055
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:03.010
I mean. I just...

1056
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.510
Honestly. I can't bear the
thought of his response.

1057
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.350
Okay. well just
come-- you know.

1058
00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.280
drink a lot. have
a lot of wine.

1059
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.280
Try to act normal.

1060
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:15.760
You need to go home and you
need to talk to him already.

1061
00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.020
Uh...

1062
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.160
Why are you eating?

1063
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:21.090
Stand up!

1064
00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:23.160
I want to kill you.
Get off this couch!

1065
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.800
You're making crumbs
everywhere.

1066
00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.030
Oh. Hi. honey.

1067
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:31.070
What?

1068
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.570
What? Wait. hold on.

1069
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.570
What's wrong?

1070
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:35.570
What do you mean?
Are you okay?

1071
00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:38.380
Okay. okay. But can you
just tell me right now?

1072
00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:39.380
Is it bad?

1073
00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.750
-What?
-God. he's crying.

1074
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.190
-Oh. no. why? What happened?
-I don't know.

1075
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.190
He says he's fine.

1076
00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.190
but he said he needs me
to come home right now.

1077
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.290
Okay. All right.

1078
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:53.760
I got to go. Let's go.
Come on. let's go.

1079
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:54.760
I'm good here.

1080
00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.800
Get up!

1081
00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:06.100
Mark. honey.
what happened?

1082
00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:08.310
You got me scared to death.
What's going on?

1083
00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.740
I was fired.

1084
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:10.780
Oh.

1085
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:13.250
Oh. you were?

1086
00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:15.680
I just want to
disappear right now.

1087
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:16.750
Hmm.

1088
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:19.180
What happened?

1089
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:20.590
I don't even know.

1090
00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:22.760
-I thought it was going well.
-Mm-hmm.

1091
00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.620
I thought the director
liked me. at least

1092
00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.130
-she said that she did.
-Mm-hmm.

1093
00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:28.760
And then after rehearsal.
she's like.

1094
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.230
"Can I talk to you
for a second?"

1095
00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.800
Takes me outside in front of
everyone.

1096
00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:33.530
says. "Grab your stuff."

1097
00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:35.870
-That is so cruel.
-Yes.

1098
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:38.340
And she's like. "You're
not quite getting this role

1099
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:39.770
"and you're going
to be replaced."

1100
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:43.240
How awful.

1101
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:44.880
I bet you the other actors
told her to fire me.

1102
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:46.650
Oh. well. fuck them.

1103
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.780
-Yeah.
-Fuck them all.

1104
00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:50.320
Yeah. I hope
their fucking play

1105
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.420
-takes a big fat fucking shit.
-Yeah.

1106
00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:55.490
It's going to be
a huge flop. you know it.

1107
00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:58.220
God. it's not your fault.

1108
00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:00.190
I mean. it is my fault.

1109
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.800
No. you've never
been fired before.

1110
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:03.900
And. you know.

1111
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.400
every actor has been fired
at least once. anyway.

1112
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.470
I got fired
from the Disney movie.

1113
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.700
Oh... right.

1114
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.370
Do you remember the hat?

1115
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:13.610
The hat.

1116
00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.910
I am so embarrassed.

1117
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.440
Oh.

1118
00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.510
I want to die.
Oh. my God. my birthday.

1119
00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:23.520
-No birthday party. okay. baby?
-Mm-hmm.

1120
00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:24.750
No birthday. No nothing.

1121
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.350
-No one here. okay?
-Okay.

1122
00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.350
No birthday.

1123
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.790
-Honey? Honey?
-Yeah?

1124
00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:34.860
The jiggling.

1125
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.930
-What?
-The whole table's shaking.

1126
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.260
Yeah. because my leg
is shaking.

1127
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.530
I can't stop my leg.

1128
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:42.670
You want salad?

1129
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:45.770
Hey. so. I heard
you got a part in a play.

1130
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.210
-What's the part?
-Er...

1131
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.880
What? What's the matter?

1132
00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.880
He was fired.

1133
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.550
-Oh. shit!
-Yeah.

1134
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.980
-Oh. my God.
-Yesterday.

1135
00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.220
Oh. we're so sorry Mark.
That's awful.

1136
00:48:58.250 --> 00:48:59.690
Yeah. I'm done
with acting. anyway.

1137
00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:00.950
No. you're not.

1138
00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.320
Honey. it's one play.

1139
00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.420
It's going to be a bomb.

1140
00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:05.830
Yeah. we'll hope for that.

1141
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.930
And besides. you can't quit
because I want to retire.

1142
00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.630
What?

1143
00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.830
You're getting all
this business now.

1144
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:15.330
I hate people.
I don't want to decorate

1145
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:16.770
their ugly houses anymore.

1146
00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.900
so meaningless.

1147
00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.670
It's like the whole
planet is melting

1148
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:21.810
and I'm just out shopping
for cashmere walls.

1149
00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.640
Is that a real thing. Sarah?

1150
00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.910
Yeah. it is. It's real.

1151
00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.680
Oh. dear God.

1152
00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:31.680
You okay?

1153
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.720
-No. I don't want that.
-Are we dead yet?

1154
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:41.430
You carry around Tums
in your bag.

1155
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.760
Oh. I carry Tums.

1156
00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:48.330
I got Gas-X. I got. um...
I got stool softener.

1157
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:50.800
I got... ooh. I got Xanax.
of course.

1158
00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:52.670
Does anyone want one?

1159
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:54.340
Does everyone want one?

1160
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:57.410
Maybe I'll just stop writing.
you know?

1161
00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.310
I mean. I think. actually.
it would be kind of a relief.

1162
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.680
Come on. Beth.

1163
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:04.320
Your agent didn't
get your book.

1164
00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.890
It's not a reason to
retire. like. her agent...

1165
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.890
I just don't... I just
don't think she's that good.

1166
00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:11.820
-You have a great career.
-Thank you.

1167
00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:12.860
You know. it's okay. Don.

1168
00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.830
Honestly. you don't
have to keep

1169
00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.000
trying to make me
feel better. okay?

1170
00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.030
Because I know
it's super tedious for you.

1171
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:29.840
Uh. okay. you got it. Done.

1172
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:33.610
-Great.
-No.

1173
00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:35.480
No. actually. you know what?

1174
00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.880
Okay. that's not very nice.

1175
00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.380
It's... It's hurtful.

1176
00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:40.820
What you just did.

1177
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:43.460
I'm sorry. are you
saying that you're hurt?

1178
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.460
Yeah. don't...
Don't take it out on me.

1179
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:46.890
Take what out on you?

1180
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:49.390
-Your frustration.
-This is a Greek olive oil.

1181
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.830
I just... You know what?
I just don't need you

1182
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.070
to lie to me anymore.

1183
00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.400
Lie to you?

1184
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.670
-Yeah.
-God. will you just stop?

1185
00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:59.040
You know. you're behaving
like a child.

1186
00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:01.610
I heard you talking.

1187
00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:05.580
I heard you
talking to Mark.

1188
00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.680
What are you talking about?

1189
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.050
-Paragon.
-What?

1190
00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.420
Sarah and I came in to say hi.

1191
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:16.090
And we overheard you guys.

1192
00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:20.490
What? You spied
on us. What?

1193
00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:24.460
What? No. I mean. it was just
for. like. a second for fun.

1194
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:28.870
-We heard you talking.
-About what?

1195
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:32.040
About my work.

1196
00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.570
Okay. hang on. Is it...

1197
00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:38.040
That's what all this
has been about?

1198
00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:42.080
That's what all of this.
all of this. has been about.

1199
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:44.380
That's exactly right.

1200
00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:47.650
I heard...

1201
00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:51.420
I heard everything
that you said.

1202
00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.360
Okay. like. like. what?

1203
00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:56.430
Like. that you hate
my new book.

1204
00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.460
What?

1205
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.700
Okay. I did not say that.

1206
00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:04.640
-That's...
-Are you kidding?

1207
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:06.370
Are you going
to gaslight me now?

1208
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:07.940
That's what it feels like.

1209
00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:11.140
-If... if I did...
-Well. you did.

1210
00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.740
But you took it out of context.

1211
00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:13.650
-Oh no. I just...
-Okay.

1212
00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.810
-I can't even handle this.
-wait. okay.

1213
00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:16.020
so that's what
I was wondering.

1214
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.680
All right. Mark.
please forgive me.

1215
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.150
You deserve to have
a really nice dinner.

1216
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:24.190
And. um. I'm sorry that you
were fired from your job.

1217
00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.890
- And happy birthday.
- Beth.

1218
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:28.860
-Thank you.
-Beth.

1219
00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:34.170
I'm. um...
I'm so sorry. Um...

1220
00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:38.040
- I should. um... I should...
- Yeah. Yeah.

1221
00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.140
Beth.

1222
00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:48.150
-Beth.
-Just leave me alone.

1223
00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:49.850
No. let me explain.

1224
00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.550
No. you...
You explained already. okay?

1225
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.720
You were pretty clear.

1226
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:57.860
Listen. whatever you heard
it is not what I meant.

1227
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:58.860
Please.

1228
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.430
You're allowed
to feel how you feel.

1229
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:01.490
You really are.

1230
00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:02.960
It's just that I don't think

1231
00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:05.700
that I can ever
trust you again.

1232
00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.670
Baby. it's not what I think.

1233
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.140
Like. you lied
right to my face.

1234
00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:14.170
-Like. a thousand times.
-No. it's not.

1235
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:16.540
-It's not lying. It's not...
-What?

1236
00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:18.540
If that's not lying.
I don't know what is lying.

1237
00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:20.050
It's not a real lie.

1238
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.580
it's knowing
that it's just my opinion.

1239
00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.580
and I'm probably wrong. okay?

1240
00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.220
I-- I didn't want
to discourage you.

1241
00:53:26.690 --> 00:53:27.750
What do I know?

1242
00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:31.090
I wanted...
I wanted to support you.

1243
00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.790
you know. whether I liked
it or not. okay?

1244
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:36.960
Who cares what I think?

1245
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:40.500
It... It's my work.

1246
00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:42.070
And I care.

1247
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.970
You know how much I care.

1248
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:47.110
You know how much
I respect your opinion.

1249
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:51.040
-Hey. come here.
-No!

1250
00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:53.780
I love you.

1251
00:53:54.610 --> 00:53:57.080
Oh. okay. well. then never mind.
My God.

1252
00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:36.220
Hi. you two.

1253
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:41.090
So. how...
How are you doing?

1254
00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:47.670
Well. we've been talking
about it and. you know.

1255
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.040
we've been coming here
for two years.

1256
00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:51.740
and as I've said.
many times before...

1257
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:54.710
We don't feel
like you're. uh. helping us.

1258
00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.640
Oh. I'm. I'm sorry
you feel that way.

1259
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:01.110
I really am. Uh.
I care about you both.

1260
00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:03.250
-Very much.
-Um...

1261
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.920
Can I ask you a question?

1262
00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:06.720
Of course.

1263
00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.920
Why don't you
ever empty your trash can?

1264
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.120
-Jonathan!
-No!

1265
00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:15.090
Every week.
I come in here and notice it.

1266
00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:17.300
And you never empty it.

1267
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.900
Um. why.
why do you think it bothers you?

1268
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:23.070
Why don't you empty
your trash can?

1269
00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:26.570
I... I empty it when it's full.

1270
00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.740
That's not full?

1271
00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:33.810
See. I think you
keep it that way

1272
00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:35.050
as. like. a little brag.

1273
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:36.320
You know.

1274
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.090
so everybody who walks in
here sees it and they're like.

1275
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:43.120
"Wow. there must be a lot
of crying going on in here."

1276
00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:49.900
Let's figure out how I can
better help the two of you.

1277
00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.870
We decided we don't want
to see you anymore.

1278
00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.630
Well. I think we need
to talk about that.

1279
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:58.100
There's nothing to talk about.
We've already talked about it.

1280
00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.740
Yeah. we're not
going to discuss it.

1281
00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.310
-But we did want to tell you.
-Yeah.

1282
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.410
Okay.

1283
00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.910
Well. I'm...
I'm really sorry to hear this.

1284
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:08.910
If you want to see someone
else. I'm happy to recommend...

1285
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:11.950
No. no. We don't want to
see another therapist.

1286
00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.320
We've seen too many therapists.

1287
00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:18.290
No. uh. we want
our money back.

1288
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:22.800
-I'm sorry?
-We want our money back.

1289
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:24.130
Um. I don't understand.

1290
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.330
From whom?

1291
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.900
Oh. well.
we were thinking

1292
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:29.070
Bill Gates might give us
the money... You!

1293
00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.800
Look. we've been coming here
for two years. okay?

1294
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.940
And in that two years.
we added it up.

1295
00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:39.880
We have spent
nearly $33.000 on you.

1296
00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:41.650
I see. Okay.

1297
00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:46.120
Yes. and because. uh. nothing
has really changed between us.

1298
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:49.690
we...we feel. and this might be
the one thing we do agree on.

1299
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.320
uh. that we are entitled
to a refund.

1300
00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:59.470
Going into therapy
doesn't have a guarantee.

1301
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.770
It's not like that.

1302
00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.400
Yeah. well.
it should be. okay?

1303
00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:05.140
because we're... we're
barely hanging on here. okay?

1304
00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:08.040
And you don't help.
Nobody helps.

1305
00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:09.710
I try to do my best. Jonathan.

1306
00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:12.280
but honestly. I can't be the
one to solve your problems.

1307
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:14.210
Well. then why
are we coming here?

1308
00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:16.150
You... You have to solve
your own problems.

1309
00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.950
And I'm here
to help you do that.

1310
00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:19.150
And I understand.

1311
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:21.490
Like. it takes--
it can take...

1312
00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.320
you know.
a long time.

1313
00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:24.290
sometimes. to
make real progress.

1314
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.030
-How long?
-Well.

1315
00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:27.360
it takes as long
as it takes.

1316
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:28.790
That's not a real answer.

1317
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:31.100
We're... We're not
kidding around here.

1318
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:32.160
And listen.

1319
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:35.830
if you need to pay by
installments. that's fine.

1320
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:37.070
We're totally cool
with that.

1321
00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:39.810
So. let me get this.

1322
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:43.380
you. you're angry because you
guys-- you just fight in here.

1323
00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:44.940
And I don't help.

1324
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:47.480
I don't tell you how to fix
things. and. you know...

1325
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:49.010
-You don't.
-Mm-hmm.

1326
00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:51.250
And you've been married.
how long?

1327
00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:53.190
-Nine years.
-Ten years.

1328
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:54.220
Ten years.

1329
00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:58.460
Have you ever considered.
uh. ending your marriage?

1330
00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.460
-What?
-What?

1331
00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:02.900
I'm going to tell you something

1332
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:05.430
that I think probably
is worth your money.

1333
00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:07.500
and I feel like it is my job
as your therapist.

1334
00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:10.170
I think you need
to consider separating.

1335
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:13.170
You want to stop therapy?

1336
00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.470
Get a divorce.

1337
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.810
What the fuck. Don? You
can't say shit like that.

1338
00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.780
How dare you.

1339
00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:21.950
Honestly.
from what I've seen.

1340
00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.750
there's nothing left
between you.

1341
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:25.990
I'm-- I'm doing you
a favor by saying this.

1342
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:28.250
You really think that?

1343
00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:29.320
Don't listen to him.

1344
00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.020
Yeah. that's exactly
what I think.

1345
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:33.090
I don't want a divorce.

1346
00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:35.490
Ah. fuck it.
Come on. Carolyn. Let's go.

1347
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:38.160
Oh. by the way. Doctor.

1348
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.170
we're not paying
for this session.

1349
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.170
Such a bold opening.
I would barely touch it.

1350
00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:48.010
Of course. I have a few
ideas and a few notes.

1351
00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:51.040
but they're tiny.
They're really. really tiny.

1352
00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.580
I'm thrilled
that you like it.

1353
00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:54.050
And. of course. I
loved your memoir.

1354
00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.080
-Oh.
-I mean.

1355
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:57.880
people don't know
how damaging verbal abuse is.

1356
00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.590
Oh. yeah. so true.

1357
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:01.050
Thank you. Thank you.

1358
00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:02.420
I mean. how do you
recover from being called

1359
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.160
stupid your entire life?

1360
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:07.330
Yeah. well. I don't--
I don't know if

1361
00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:09.430
one does
recover from that.

1362
00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:10.560
in fact. yeah.

1363
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:13.870
What was that other thing
he used to call you. um...

1364
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:15.370
Oh. yeah.
shit for brains.

1365
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.040
Yeah. No. that was a good one.

1366
00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:20.210
Shit for brains.

1367
00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.540
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1368
00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:25.510
-That's fucked.
-Yeah.

1369
00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:27.450
Anyway. let's do this.

1370
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.120
Okay. great. I'm pumped.

1371
00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:31.480
I'm glad you're pumped.

1372
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.890
I'm pumped
that you're pumped.

1373
00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:34.550
Thank you.

1374
00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:44.300
Oh. my God.
this is so perfect.

1375
00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.900
-I love it so much.
-Oh!

1376
00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:48.870
I'm so happy.

1377
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:51.040
I mean. I've never seen
anything like it.

1378
00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:52.910
-Oh...
-Thank you so much.

1379
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:54.070
Oh. you're welcome.

1380
00:59:54.110 --> 00:59:56.610
I envy you.
Must be so gratifying

1381
00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.650
when you find the right piece
and everyone's happy. right?

1382
00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.420
Oh. yeah. of course. Yeah. I'm
just so glad it worked out.

1383
01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:04.920
It's so perfect.

1384
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.190
It's really a good one.
One of a kind.

1385
01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.460
-Honey.
-Uh-huh.

1386
01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:18.200
What is all this?

1387
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:23.500
-Oh. my God.
-Mm-hmm.

1388
01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.640
Wow.

1389
01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:29.410
Those are very special
for wicking.

1390
01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.680
Oh. I love wicking.

1391
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:34.280
These are gonna keep you.
apparently.

1392
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:35.450
-very warm...
-Hmm.

1393
01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.180
...if...if you are cold.
but you won't get sweaty.

1394
01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.250
And unlike these.

1395
01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:44.360
which are specifically
for if you like to sweat.

1396
01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.960
-And... and it's also vegan
-Hmm.

1397
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:49.460
so you can eat them.

1398
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.270
And then these
are made from pork.

1399
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.900
but these
are from eyelashes.

1400
01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.640
Perfect. You're the best.

1401
01:01:02.010 --> 01:01:03.180
I'm done with acting.

1402
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:07.550
I am.
The profession's ridiculous.

1403
01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:11.120
I'm tired of wanting validation
and never getting it.

1404
01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:12.550
I'm old.

1405
01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:14.050
I just can't do it anymore.

1406
01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.230
If you don't love it.
don't do it.

1407
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:23.160
Aren't you going to tell me
I shouldn't quit?

1408
01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.700
You shouldn't quit.

1409
01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:25.930
Why not?

1410
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:27.700
Because you're so good.

1411
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.070
Well. I'm still quitting.

1412
01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.140
Who gives a shit. really?

1413
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.110
I thought I loved it.

1414
01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:35.110
I don't.

1415
01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.480
I think I just wanted
to become famous.

1416
01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:47.220
She used to look at me
like. "Are you done yet?"

1417
01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:50.120
Now. what if I can't write?

1418
01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:52.520
I mean. what. I'm going to work
in a pot store my whole life?

1419
01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.090
Why don't you
let us read it?

1420
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:56.700
It's not done yet.

1421
01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.200
If I'm ever done.
I will let you read it.

1422
01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:01.700
But right now.
just getting to the end

1423
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:03.570
is going to feel like
a huge accomplishment.

1424
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.470
Honey. because it is
a huge accomplishment.

1425
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.010
I bet it's going
to be terrific.

1426
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.510
You don't know that.
It might stink.

1427
01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.640
Yeah. yeah. it'll
probably stink.

1428
01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.650
Why do you do that?

1429
01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:16.420
-Do what?
-You haven't read it.

1430
01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:18.350
Just let it be shitty
if it's shitty.

1431
01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.550
Hey. what's going on with you?
What-- What is this?

1432
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:24.160
You're always expecting
the best from me.

1433
01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:26.660
You're welcome?

1434
01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.500
Do you remember when you
said I was a great swimmer

1435
01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:32.560
and you enrolled me
in that advanced class?

1436
01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.630
-Oh. boy.
-I wasn't a great swimmer.

1437
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:37.670
I kept telling you that.
I was average.

1438
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:40.770
My teacher even said
I should take a beginner class.

1439
01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:42.410
-She did?
-Yeah.

1440
01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.440
it was-- it was mortifying.

1441
01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:47.410
But worse than that.
I didn't know who to believe.

1442
01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:49.820
I knew that I wasn't good.

1443
01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:52.280
but my mom was saying I was.

1444
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.550
So. was I good?

1445
01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.590
Or is my mom a liar?

1446
01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.060
Well. why did I think
you were good?

1447
01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.420
You didn't.

1448
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:01.530
You wanted me to think I was.

1449
01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.130
Maybe I thought you
could be good

1450
01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.130
and I was just
being encouraging.

1451
01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:09.330
Then it's like
you set me up to fail.

1452
01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:13.710
Really? Okay.

1453
01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:16.210
Jeez. I'm sorry.

1454
01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:18.180
That's enough blaming.

1455
01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:19.550
-El. c'mon.
-No. it's fine. Okay?

1456
01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.450
He should tell us these things.

1457
01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:22.780
I want to hear this.

1458
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.280
Middle school.
Remember my English teacher.

1459
01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.820
-Mr. Saap?
-Yeah.

1460
01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:28.650
He gave me a C
on some paper I wrote.

1461
01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:30.860
and I came home and I said
I worked really hard on it.

1462
01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:32.060
I deserve better.

1463
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:36.260
Okay. I don't remember this.
but okay.

1464
01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.870
Well. you said. "Well. if you
worked really hard on it.

1465
01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.400
"then you should've gotten
a better grade."

1466
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.570
So you went to the guy and
convinced him to give me a B.

1467
01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.510
And the crime here
is what exactly?

1468
01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.110
I didn't deserve the B.

1469
01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:50.880
I deserved the C.

1470
01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.510
But I didn't want you
to know that.

1471
01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:54.650
Hang on a second. Eliot.
Come on.

1472
01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:58.550
You told me you deserved
a better grade. right?

1473
01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.250
And I believed you.

1474
01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:02.620
So. actually. in this case.

1475
01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:04.790
you were setting
me up. right. honey?

1476
01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.490
Mom. I was a child.

1477
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:10.800
I wasn't a good swimmer.
I wasn't a good student.

1478
01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:13.530
Eliot. she was trying
to be supportive.

1479
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:16.170
It's what parents do.
They try to support their kids.

1480
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:19.240
But then I grew up with this...
with this strange feeling.

1481
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:22.170
like I'm better
than everyone else.

1482
01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:24.710
Like I was looking at myself
through your eyes.

1483
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:30.380
And then suddenly I realized
I'm not the things you say I am.

1484
01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:32.550
Oh. sweetie pie.

1485
01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.550
I honestly think you did those
things because you felt guilty.

1486
01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.120
Feel guilty.

1487
01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.160
For what?

1488
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.360
Because you guys care about
each other more than me.

1489
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:43.860
-What?
-What?

1490
01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.430
Eliot. how can you
possibly think that?

1491
01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.870
That is so not true.

1492
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.410
I care about you
more than anything.

1493
01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.410
Yeah.

1494
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.840
Then why do I always feel
like a third fucking wheel?

1495
01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:02.710
-Eliot.
-Oh. honey.

1496
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.650
I just. I need some space.

1497
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:07.750
Oh.

1498
01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:09.790
Wow.

1499
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.330
Oh. wow.

1500
01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.660
Fuck.

1501
01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.940
Seriously?

1502
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:32.480
-After that?
-After what?

1503
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:35.780
Eliot just accused you
of fucking him up

1504
01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.650
because you didn't
treat him honestly.

1505
01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:40.950
And you're mad at me. for
doing exactly the same thing.

1506
01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.660
I wasn't lying.
I was encouraging.

1507
01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:44.790
I wasn't lying.

1508
01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.590
-I was encouraging.
-That's not true.

1509
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:48.360
You were lying
to be encouraging.

1510
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:50.230
No. supporting you
felt more important.

1511
01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.260
I'm not a child.

1512
01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:53.700
Eliot was a child!

1513
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:58.600
I didn't want him to feel
like I felt growing up.

1514
01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:02.240
Well. I know. but you're...
You're not your father.

1515
01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:05.410
Well. my mother. Okay?

1516
01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.580
Okay. Yeah.
maybe a little.

1517
01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.520
I just really wanted
you to like it.

1518
01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:20.830
I know.

1519
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:25.000
Honestly. I don't care
if I like your book.

1520
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.470
That's not why
I love you. Beth.

1521
01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.540
You're not your book.

1522
01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.040
Do you love Eliot because he
might write a fantastic play?

1523
01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:37.810
-No. Don. I but...
-I have to say this. I'm sorry.

1524
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.350
You know.

1525
01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.620
this whole world
is falling apart

1526
01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:45.020
and this is
what's consuming you?

1527
01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:47.850
No. I know the whole world
is falling apart.

1528
01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:49.290
Of course I know that.

1529
01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.490
But this is my world.

1530
01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.360
My small little
narcissistic world

1531
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:57.630
and... you know. I'm hurt.

1532
01:06:58.730 --> 01:07:01.270
Sorry. I trusted you.

1533
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:03.340
I trust you.

1534
01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:08.410
Honey. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I...

1535
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.850
Beth. haven't you
ever lied to me?

1536
01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.980
Like. I don't know
told me a white lie or...

1537
01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.620
-Well. yeah. I bet...
-Yeah. and...

1538
01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:22.720
It didn't make you...
Did it make you love me less?

1539
01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.690
Or. or lose respect for me?

1540
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:26.930
No. it... This is not
the same thing at all.

1541
01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.060
They just-- These were small
things. you know. like...

1542
01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.860
There's no comparison.

1543
01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:35.370
Really honestly. it's not like
your career. your work. or...

1544
01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.540
But like what?

1545
01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:41.340
Um... I don't know...

1546
01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.780
You bought me things
that I pretended to like.

1547
01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:46.050
I mean nothing.

1548
01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:47.950
Oh. really?

1549
01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:50.780
Well. what things?

1550
01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:07.900
Oh. which ones?

1551
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:13.670
All of them?
You're kidding me.

1552
01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:15.670
What? What...

1553
01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:17.810
Uh-huh.

1554
01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.150
What. why didn't
you tell me? What...

1555
01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.480
I did. I said I wanted
these leaf earrings.

1556
01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.520
and then you kept...

1557
01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:30.120
buying me all of these
leaf earrings.

1558
01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.930
But I've... I've seen
you wearing them.

1559
01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.490
Of course.
to. to make you happy.

1560
01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:36.700
-No.
-Yeah.

1561
01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:38.100
To please you.

1562
01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.500
No. you know what?

1563
01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.740
You've given me things
that I don't like.

1564
01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:48.710
-Oh. The wok?
-No.

1565
01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:51.710
The last V-neck
sweater you bought me?

1566
01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.510
It's like the third one.

1567
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:55.180
Who doesn't like
a cashmere sweater?

1568
01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:59.420
It's a V-neck. No man wants a
V-neck we have nothing to show.

1569
01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.520
What?

1570
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:04.690
What in the living hell are
you talking about?

1571
01:09:05.690 --> 01:09:08.760
I don't have any cleavage.
why would I wear a V-neck?

1572
01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:10.200
No. I'm serious.

1573
01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:12.770
Don. a V-neck
goes like this.

1574
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:13.830
-right?
-Yeah.

1575
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:15.670
And cleavage is like this.

1576
01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:18.600
Still. I just... I don't think I
should be like showing my chest.

1577
01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.670
I mean. I'm not. like.
on a yacht in the wind.

1578
01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:22.410
-You know I don't...
-Oh. my God.

1579
01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:27.580
-You know what else?
-Huh?

1580
01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:29.710
You've always told me
what a great shrink I am.

1581
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.650
-Yeah.
-You have no idea.

1582
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.820
-What?
-Like. I might suck.

1583
01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:33.990
In fact. I do suck.

1584
01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:36.760
-No. that's not possible.
-No. it's very. very possible.

1585
01:09:36.790 --> 01:09:37.860
Oh. really?

1586
01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:39.890
You want to tell me about it?

1587
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:41.890
It's okay. and not now.

1588
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.070
What are
we gonna do about our boy?

1589
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.100
I don't know.

1590
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:54.510
Maybe you are
a bad shrink.

1591
01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:56.570
Yeah.

1592
01:09:57.210 --> 01:09:59.210
-Yeah.
-Oh...

1593
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:05.080
So. that other agent
wants to represent my book.

1594
01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.250
Which one?
Are they any good?

1595
01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:08.960
-Oh. I hope so.
-Tim Wilson.

1596
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:11.860
Oh. just make sure
they do a better job with it

1597
01:10:11.890 --> 01:10:12.960
than your last one.

1598
01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:14.860
Jesus. Mom.

1599
01:10:14.890 --> 01:10:16.000
What?

1600
01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:17.760
It should have done better.

1601
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.770
Okay. but how does
that help me?

1602
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.730
Really. if you
think about it?

1603
01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:26.070
You're so reactive.
I'm just being honest.

1604
01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.980
They didn't do
a good job marketing it.

1605
01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:30.080
Okay.

1606
01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:31.980
I didn't know you were
an expert on marketing.

1607
01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.680
I'm-- I'm actually
kind of confused

1608
01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:34.380
because I thought
you were a secretary.

1609
01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:38.080
-Executive secretary.
-Okay.

1610
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.120
Anyway. I know things.

1611
01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.260
Okay? Yeah.

1612
01:10:44.290 --> 01:10:49.100
Well. I... I did have a book
published. and it did okay.

1613
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:52.000
And now it looks like I'm gonna
have another book published.

1614
01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:57.000
- And I am so proud of you.
- Yeah.

1615
01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.870
-My girl.
-Yeah.

1616
01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:03.210
I like this couch.

1617
01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.750
-You do?
-Yes.

1618
01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.920
I forgot to tell you.
I want that shirt back.

1619
01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.720
-What shirt?
-The nice one I gave you.

1620
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:16.120
The one you never wear?

1621
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.990
It doesn't matter if
I never wear it.

1622
01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.190
It's mine and
I want it back.

1623
01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:21.560
Well. it's too late.

1624
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:23.200
Cause I dropped it
off at the shelter already.

1625
01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.260
Why'd you do that?

1626
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.830
Because I... you gave it--

1627
01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:27.230
-Good morning. Hi there.
-Good morning.

1628
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:28.770
-Hi.
-Good morning.

1629
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:31.770
All right...

1630
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:35.940
-How are you today. Georgia?
-Not good.

1631
01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:38.210
So many things hurt me.

1632
01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.210
-Her leg is worse.
-Okay...

1633
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:41.850
I can speak for myself.

1634
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.980
Oh. okay. great.

1635
01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:46.190
Look at. you're so
young and cute...

1636
01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:48.290
And already a doctor.

1637
01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.790
Isn't that impressive?

1638
01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.790
It's just...
it's mind blowing. Mom.

1639
01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.690
Thank you.
But I'm not as young as I look.

1640
01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:56.130
-How old are you?
-Mommy. c'mon.

1641
01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.600
Before I examine you.

1642
01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.930
I have something I'd like
to get out of the way first.

1643
01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:01.000
Mm...

1644
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:03.140
There are many expenses
to running this practice.

1645
01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:04.900
and they're
making it impossible

1646
01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.340
for me to spend quality
time with each patient.

1647
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:11.640
Mmm. Dr. Weinstein
spent a lot of time with me.

1648
01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.280
Yes. but he's retired.

1649
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:16.750
My practice is very busy.

1650
01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:20.850
So this office needs to start
charging a concierge fee.

1651
01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:22.790
It's unfortunate.
but necessary.

1652
01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.760
-Uh-huh.
-Are you aware of what that is?

1653
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:28.130
You park my car.
I don't have a car.

1654
01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.300
Let me explain.

1655
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:32.870
Once a year. you pay $800
to receive the best care.

1656
01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:36.800
That sounds like a deal.

1657
01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.840
Well. but it's...

1658
01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:40.010
It's not including
the regular charges.

1659
01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:42.140
I see. Um...

1660
01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:44.140
Well. of course.

1661
01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:47.150
I'll pay the concierge fee
if that's what's needed.

1662
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:49.180
Terrific.
I wouldn't want

1663
01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.880
-to lose you as a patient.
-Uh-huh...

1664
01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.820
Now for your exam.

1665
01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:55.690
Okay. Well. I'll give
you your privacy.

1666
01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.320
-Good to see ya.
-Good to see you.

1667
01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.360
- I have your purse.
- Where's my purse?

1668
01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:01.760
-I have your purse.
-Take care of my purse.

1669
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:03.130
I got it. Mom.
I have your purse.

1670
01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.230
-I'll be right here.
-I've got it.

1671
01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.730
Thank you.

1672
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.640
Ah...

1673
01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:14.710
I'm so glad
this place is still here.

1674
01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.440
They make the
best tuna fish.

1675
01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.780
Yeah.

1676
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:22.680
- This menu is filthy.
- I know.

1677
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:24.980
Under the plastic. it's filthy.

1678
01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:26.250
Completely. It smells bad. too.

1679
01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:30.660
Oh... I have to
get another doctor.

1680
01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.990
I mean. if she thinks
that I'm going to pay her $800

1681
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:37.900
so she can have all that
fancy-schmancy furniture.

1682
01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:40.170
-she's nuts.
-Yeah. I figured.

1683
01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:42.800
I figured. mama.
I figured.

1684
01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.100
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1685
01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.740
-Take care.
-See you soon.

1686
01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:56.050
Hey Jim... Um. c'mon in.

1687
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.020
Hi...

1688
01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:02.990
Okay.

1689
01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.460
If I'm in therapy
when I'm that age. kill me.

1690
01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.130
I. uh... I find it admirable.

1691
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:14.500
It's pathetic. guy's going to
drop dead in five seconds.

1692
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:16.300
What. he's going to change?

1693
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:18.700
I don't know. maybe.

1694
01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.440
Before we get started.

1695
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:22.140
I want to talk to you
about something.

1696
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:23.740
Okay.

1697
01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.740
At the end of our last session

1698
01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:29.220
and the previous zoom session.
um... right as we finished.

1699
01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:31.880
uh. I... overheard you
say some things

1700
01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.390
which... uh. expressed
your frustration with me.

1701
01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:37.120
I didn't do that.

1702
01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:47.030
Okay.

1703
01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.240
We can move on.

1704
01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:51.470
What would you like
to talk about today?

1705
01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:55.070
My brother and
sister are still not

1706
01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:58.240
really talking to
me and I don't...

1707
01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:00.080
Know what to do about it.

1708
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.020
Huh. I have an idea.

1709
01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.020
-Thank God.
-Um...

1710
01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:07.250
Why don't you do something
for your siblings

1711
01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:09.920
so that. um. they
can help your father.

1712
01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:12.490
It might help. you know.
repair things with them a bit.

1713
01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:14.790
Okay. like what?

1714
01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.900
Um... I don't know.
do they have kids or...

1715
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.160
Yeah. my sister does.

1716
01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:22.430
Okay. maybe watch your sister's
kids so that she can help him.

1717
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:24.940
-She has a nanny.
-Um... Um...

1718
01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:26.870
Go food shopping.
something...

1719
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:29.380
Maybe ask her
what she...she needs.

1720
01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:32.010
And. you know. you can do
the same for your brother.

1721
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:37.050
Yeah. Um...

1722
01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:39.050
That's a good idea.

1723
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:42.090
I can. uh...
Maybe I'll try that.

1724
01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:43.790
Okay.

1725
01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:48.560
-Uh. see you next week.
-See ya.

1726
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:07.480
Hi. darling.

1727
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:08.880
Mom. what are you doing here?

1728
01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:12.550
Would it be weird
if I bought pot from you?

1729
01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:16.160
- No.
- Don't take my donuts.

1730
01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:20.560
-What do you want?
-Um...

1731
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:24.030
I don't know. something to
make life worth living.

1732
01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.560
-I got that.
-Okay.

1733
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:29.170
-Hi.
-So. hey...

1734
01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.540
Eliot tells me
you're a writer too.

1735
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.910
Oh. yeah. I am. Books.

1736
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.010
-Cool.
-Um-hmm...

1737
01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.410
Well. if you ever write
a screenplay. let me know.

1738
01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.110
I'm an executive producer.

1739
01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:41.310
Oh. wow. Okay. great.

1740
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:43.320
-Thank you so much.
-Try these.

1741
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:44.320
-Okay.
-Hey.

1742
01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:46.320
-Gummies.
-How can I help you guys?

1743
01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:47.990
Just checking out
the wares. you know.

1744
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:49.890
Eliot.
look at these guys.

1745
01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:50.890
Are you kidding me.

1746
01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.020
-why do you work here?
-Enough.

1747
01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:53.330
Everybody on the floor!

1748
01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.090
-Oh shit!
-Stay down.

1749
01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.330
Get some vapes.
Some flavored ones.

1750
01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.130
- Come here.
- And some bags.

1751
01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:01.000
Those gummies.
wait are those indica?

1752
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:03.170
-I don't know.
-Just indica. idiot.

1753
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.600
This is a hybrid.
Is that okay?

1754
01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:08.270
Whatever. Hurry up!
Where's the money?

1755
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:09.640
It's in a box.

1756
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:10.980
- Give it to me!
- No.

1757
01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.610
All right. I can help you find
what you need if...if you want.

1758
01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:15.110
Hurry up. C'mon!

1759
01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:17.280
Get up and give
me the money.

1760
01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:19.050
Just give it...

1761
01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.020
-Okay. move. That's it.
-Mom. you're not helping.

1762
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.100
Oh. my God.

1763
01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:35.430
- Oh. God.
- Holy crap.

1764
01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.600
That was
really fucked up.

1765
01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.370
Is everybody okay?
Are you guys okay?

1766
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:40.570
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

1767
01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:42.510
-Yeah.
-Oh. my God.

1768
01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:49.480
We're okay.

1769
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.350
I love you so much.

1770
01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.580
I know you do.

1771
01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:58.260
I've never been
so scared in my life.

1772
01:17:58.290 --> 01:18:00.630
You know. I've never seen
a gun before.

1773
01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:01.990
Oh. honey...

1774
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:04.000
I mean. like that.
you know.

1775
01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:08.070
Thank. just... just thank
God you're both okay.

1776
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.400
Okay. so then we go to
the police afterwards. right?

1777
01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.600
And I give them a description

1778
01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:15.540
of these guys and they
didn't give a shit at all.

1779
01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:17.540
Can you imagine?
That. like...

1780
01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:19.510
-Oh. come here. come here.
-Yeah.

1781
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:24.220
God. it's so hot in here.
I'm sweating.

1782
01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:25.180
-Can you get off of me.
-Sorry.

1783
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:28.220
I don't know. why do you
make it so hot in here?

1784
01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:31.360
Uh. I kind of feel like
it washes my face off.

1785
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:32.690
Hmm...

1786
01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.360
Don't wash it off.
It's a nice face.

1787
01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.230
Can you pass me
my toothbrush?

1788
01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:39.300
Yeah.

1789
01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:43.000
Have you thought
about what I said?

1790
01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.440
Um... Yeah.

1791
01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.340
I think if you want to do it.
You should do it.

1792
01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.210
You telling me the truth?

1793
01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.250
You don't. um--
You don't think I'm crazy?

1794
01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:58.180
Honey. I actually do think
you're a little bit crazy but...

1795
01:18:58.450 --> 01:19:03.190
So. you're...you're okay
if I... if I do it?

1796
01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.730
Uh-huh. I really
do support you.

1797
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:09.030
Okay.

1798
01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:12.100
-Thank you. Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

1799
01:19:12.130 --> 01:19:13.430
Yeah. I want your support.

1800
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:15.200
You got it.

1801
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:20.640
Yeah. she was so happy about
that crazy lamp. it just...

1802
01:19:21.210 --> 01:19:23.140
scared the shit out of me.

1803
01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:27.210
Made me realize that I just
need to do something else.

1804
01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:28.750
I don't know.
something meaningful.

1805
01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:31.050
No. what you do
is kind of meaningful.

1806
01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.020
-To who?
-No one.

1807
01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.460
-Shut up.
-I'm kidding.

1808
01:19:36.490 --> 01:19:38.060
Hi. Eileen.

1809
01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.660
I like this.

1810
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:42.090
Oh.

1811
01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.200
Really?

1812
01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:46.800
But she...

1813
01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.400
You know what. Eileen?

1814
01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.600
I'm going to be
straight with you.

1815
01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:55.040
This is just not
the best one for you.

1816
01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.040
You know. what I think
would be so perfect is this.

1817
01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:01.710
That's an awful color
and pattern.

1818
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:03.780
- Well.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1819
01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:10.190
Ooh. I love that for you.

1820
01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:12.220
-Me too.
-That's so great.

1821
01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.190
-Thank you.
-Screams you.

1822
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:17.400
We are too nice
to our mother.

1823
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:18.530
I know.

1824
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:23.530
- Here she is.
- Sorry.

1825
01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.800
-Did you guys order?
-No. we waited.

1826
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:27.570
Oh. you didn't have
to do that.

1827
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.840
Yeah. of course.

1828
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.240
Ah. Champagne.

1829
01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.240
-Hey.
-Hey.

1830
01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:37.210
- Happy Anniversary.
- Oh...

1831
01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.780
Happy Anniversary.

1832
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:40.910
Happy Anniversary.

1833
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:43.220
I can't believe
you're still married.

1834
01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.220
-What the fuck. Eliot?
-Cheers.

1835
01:21:45.250 --> 01:21:46.520
-Weird.
-Cheers.

1836
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:47.550
Cheers.

1837
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:52.860
- Oh. a little something...
- Oh...

1838
01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:57.560
Presents. already?
Goodness me.

1839
01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:58.730
Hmm.

1840
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:04.570
No...

1841
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:09.640
No way. Good one.

1842
01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:12.510
All right. Here's your gifty.

1843
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:13.950
-Oh. wow.
-Yeah.

1844
01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:15.920
You're gonna put me to shame.

1845
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:20.290
Ah... No!

1846
01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:24.420
I cannot believe we had
the same idea.

1847
01:22:24.460 --> 01:22:27.230
-What's going on?
-Um...

1848
01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:29.460
-It's a little inside joke.
-Yeah.

1849
01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:30.700
Oh. fabulous.

1850
01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.470
Every year we give each
other the same wrong thing.

1851
01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.600
and so...
we just thought we would...

1852
01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:38.500
recycle the same
wrong thing. huh? Yeah.

1853
01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:39.910
That's adorable.

1854
01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:41.570
Do. uh... Do you want it?

1855
01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:45.710
- No. it's a V-neck.
- Oh. Jesus.

1856
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:49.310
You've done some--

1857
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:51.480
some hard work in this
room over the years.

1858
01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.720
I'm gonna miss you.

1859
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:55.450
You've been with me through...

1860
01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:58.660
Two divorces. my crazy kids.

1861
01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.990
my cancer.

1862
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:03.030
It's been an honor. Truly.

1863
01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.560
For me as well.

1864
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:06.570
Can't believe I'm done.

1865
01:23:07.730 --> 01:23:09.330
You can always come back.

1866
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:11.940
You're way too expensive.

1867
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:18.610
I was just meeting
with Nolan.

1868
01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.910
Oh. what'd he say?

1869
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:22.920
He asked me to
write him a few new songs.

1870
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:24.380
That sounds good.

1871
01:23:24.650 --> 01:23:27.490
For free. Yeah...

1872
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:30.290
I sent him 20 songs already.

1873
01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:32.860
Well. I guess none
of them are quite right.

1874
01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:34.660
No...

1875
01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:36.030
-You did?
-Hey. hey. hey.

1876
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:37.700
Oh...

1877
01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.730
Honey. you were
so fantastic.

1878
01:23:40.770 --> 01:23:43.370
- Really?
- Remarkable.

1879
01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.300
Oh. my goodness

1880
01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:45.670
-you were so great.
-Thank you. my love.

1881
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:46.810
Where's Don?

1882
01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.070
Oh. he's not feeling well.

1883
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:49.440
So. he's so sorry
he couldn't make it.

1884
01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:50.940
-Yeah.
-Oh. fuck him.

1885
01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.440
-Hey. You were great.
-Thanks. Eliot.

1886
01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:53.480
-Thank you for coming.
-Yeah.

1887
01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:55.580
-You guys enjoyed it? Yeah.
-Loved it.

1888
01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:56.920
Aw. thank you my love.

1889
01:23:57.580 --> 01:24:00.350
Yo! There he is. the star.

1890
01:24:00.390 --> 01:24:02.050
-Nice job man. So good.
-Awesome work.

1891
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:04.060
-The Josh P. Pace.
-I know.

drafts are. Yeah.

Well. it's a
little bruised...

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:48.760
Uh...

1936
01:25:49.130 --> 01:25:51.100
