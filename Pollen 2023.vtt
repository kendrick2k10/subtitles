Hey. honey. It's your mom.

4
00:01:00.147 --> 00:01:01.626
I just wanted to call again.

5
00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:03.454
I was hoping maybe you'd
answer.

6
00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:06.805
We just haven't heard from you
in. like. six days.

7
00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:10.766
We're all really.
really nervous.

8
00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:13.247
Your friends don't know
where you are.

9
00:01:13.464 --> 00:01:16.859
That new boy you're dating.
then you broke up two weeks
ago?

10
00:01:17.816 --> 00:01:21.211
If anything happened to you.
I'd just die.

11
00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:24.823
I love you so much.

12
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:26.086
Please just call.

13
00:01:27.913 --> 00:01:28.871

00:03:46.748 --> 00:03:48.140
I'm-- I'm at work.

34
00:03:48.358 --> 00:03:49.272
Can't talk to
your sister at work?

35
00:03:51.274 --> 00:03:53.537
Can you please help?
She'll just be coloring.

36
00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:55.974
No. I have to work.

37
00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:58.890
Tonight?
Like. just from 8:00 to 9:00?

38
00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.676
Look. I have to go.

39
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.331
Fine. See you Monday. Love you.

40
00:04:10.206 --> 00:04:11.425
Was that your sister?

41
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.688
Yeah.

42
00:04:13.862 --> 00:04:15.994
Is she single?

43
00:04:16.168 --> 00:04:18.432
Uh. yeah. She is. actually.

44
00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:21.217
-Are you single?
-Uh...

45
00:04:22.697 --> 00:04:23.741
kind of.

46
00:04:25.177 --> 00:04:26.266
I have siblings too.

47
00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:33.229
How many siblings do you have?

48
00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:39.017
Two from my dad
and two from my stepmom.

49
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.238
That's awesome.

50
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:58.776
Oh. Did you guys have
the conference room booked?

51
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.431
No. It's fine. we're eating too.

52
00:05:01.605 --> 00:05:03.520
Oh. Cool.

53
00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:05.392
Have you ever been to Italy?

54
00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:09.091
-No.
-Oh. my God!

55
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:11.746
You should totally go.
It's amazing.

56
00:05:11.963 --> 00:05:14.444
-I would love to.
-My family and I go every year.

57
00:05:14.618 --> 00:05:17.317
We go to Florence.
and then we go to Positano.

58
00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:19.797
Oh. is that the place where they
have all the houses built into

59
00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:21.451
-the side of the hill?
-Yes! And they have these

60
00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.714
really special lemons.

61
00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:28.066
Hera. have you been anywhere?

62
00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:30.765
Oh. I don't travel much.

63
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:32.593
Neither do I.

64
00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:35.335
The kids are too young.
and Mike would never let me

65
00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:36.858
leave him alone with them.

66
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:41.776
Hera.
what are you doing tonight?

67
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.126
-I'm going on a date.
-With who?

68
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.389
A friend.

69
00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:50.001
-Named... Zach?
-Really?

70
00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.787
Well. if you don't say anything.
it never really happened. right?

71
00:05:54.963 --> 00:05:56.791
So. have you guys
fucked in the office yet?

72
00:06:02.231 --> 00:06:03.841
We got a big one. team!

73
00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:07.410
$10 million account.

74
00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:09.630
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

75
00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:11.675
Sounds like
you owe us some champagne!

76
00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:31.913
So. I had an incredible night.

77
00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:33.523
Me too.

78
00:06:34.437 --> 00:06:35.395
Can I come in?

79
00:06:35.612 --> 00:06:37.614
No!

80
00:06:37.788 --> 00:06:39.660
What's wrong? I...

81
00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:42.184
You like the gift. right?

82
00:06:42.358 --> 00:06:43.794
I can buy my own plants.

83
00:06:43.968 --> 00:06:46.014
Not if you're only making $100K.

84
00:06:46.754 --> 00:06:48.495
What makes you think
I make $100K?

85
00:06:48.973 --> 00:06:50.453
Well. that's what I made
right out of college.

86
00:06:52.586 --> 00:06:56.198
-I make way less than that.
-Hera. I'm not trying to brag.

87
00:06:57.547 --> 00:07:00.463
Just saying. you can
come to me if you need help.

88
00:07:00.637 --> 00:07:02.291
With your tests. your accounts.

89
00:07:05.468 --> 00:07:06.513
And you are...

90
00:07:07.383 --> 00:07:08.471
so pretty.

91
00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:12.040
It sucks.

92
00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.651
There's a glass ceiling.

93
00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:17.785
Without help. it'll crush you.

94
00:07:20.788 --> 00:07:22.746
-I should probably get to bed.
-Hera.

95
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.097
Come on. just invite me inside.

96
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:28.622
I just moved.
so I have a lot of boxes.

97
00:07:28.796 --> 00:07:30.014
But you-- you could come

98
00:07:30.188 --> 00:07:31.276
-another time. maybe--
-Hera. Hey.

99
00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:34.062
-Hera.
-Zach.

100
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:35.759
-Hera.
-Zach.

101
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:37.457
-Hera.
-Zach...

102
00:07:41.983 --> 00:07:44.986
If-- if you didn't
want this to happen.

103
00:07:45.856 --> 00:07:47.379
why'd you let me
ask you out again?

104
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:50.034
I mean. I live. like.
40 fucking minutes away.

105
00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:54.125
So I was-- I was
taking your lead on things.

106
00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:55.953
I thought you liked me.

107
00:07:56.127 --> 00:07:57.259
I do.

108
00:07:57.738 --> 00:08:00.131
I just-- I don't wanna be
another win to you.

109
00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:03.221
Well. you're making me look
like a fuckin' loser out here.

110
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.009
Can we talk about this later?

111
00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:12.579
You could have everything.

112
00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:19.673
Come on.

113
00:08:20.369 --> 00:08:21.979
-Let's have some fun.
-No.

114
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:24.547
-Let's just have some fun.
-Please stop.

115
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.377
-Ooh. I like when you beg.
-No...

116
00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:30.814
No. please. stop. Please. stop.

117
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:35.906
Just invite me inside.

118
00:08:37.342 --> 00:08:38.735
Just invite me inside.

119
00:08:40.215 --> 00:08:41.303
No.

120
00:08:41.782 --> 00:08:42.913
I don't want to.

121
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.394
Do you want me
to turn the handle for you?

122
00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:49.572
Okay.

123
00:08:50.442 --> 00:08:51.531
Okay.

124
00:08:52.706 --> 00:08:54.621
It's that easy. Come on.

125
00:09:27.131 --> 00:09:28.219
Zach?

126
00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:32.572
Zach?

127
00:10:58.832 --> 00:11:00.268
You've reached
Zachary Osman.

128
00:11:00.442 --> 00:11:02.313

at Paver Financial.

129
00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:04.315

130
00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:05.752
will reach out. Thanks.

131
00:11:05.969 --> 00:11:07.057
Hey.

132
00:11:07.536 --> 00:11:11.148
Um. sorry I'm calling your work.

133
00:11:11.714 --> 00:11:15.065
I-- I don't have
your personal cell.

134
00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:17.938
Um. I just wanted to--

135
00:11:18.112 --> 00:11:21.419
to call and say hi
and talk about last night.

136
00:11:22.464 --> 00:11:23.552
Um...

137
00:11:24.814 --> 00:11:27.904

and. um...

138
00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:29.906
and I really like
the flower you got me.

139
00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:35.477
Just call me back
when you get this.

140
00:11:36.608 --> 00:11:38.175
Okay.

141
00:11:38.349 --> 00:11:39.437
Bye.

142
00:11:40.612 --> 00:11:41.701
Bye.

143
00:13:20.364 --> 00:13:22.802
Can't sleep?

144
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:15.593
-Hey.
-Hey. Sorry. it's late.

145
00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:17.073
I'm sure you're asleep.

146
00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:19.162
You want me to come
and get my jacket right now?

147
00:14:20.642 --> 00:14:22.252
Did you listen to my voicemail?

148
00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:24.689
How about I come over

149
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.257
and you answer the door
wearing just my jacket?

150
00:14:35.222 --> 00:14:36.397
I don't have it.

151
00:14:36.614 --> 00:14:38.007
Is something wrong with you?

152
00:14:38.181 --> 00:14:40.140
Jesus.
You know what. never mind.

153
00:14:41.532 --> 00:14:42.620
Zach?

154
00:14:43.578 --> 00:14:44.666
Zach?

155
00:15:27.535 --> 00:15:28.840
What do we think?

156
00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:32.105
For work.

157
00:15:33.541 --> 00:15:34.585
For Zach.

158
00:16:02.787 --> 00:16:04.615
-Any plans this week?
-Oh. yeah.

159
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.574
-What?
-Work.

160
00:16:07.053 --> 00:16:08.750
My man. My man.

161
00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:11.492
-Hi.
-Hey.

162
00:16:12.623 --> 00:16:15.148
You. uh. have something else
on your desk. Got it for you.

163
00:16:18.325 --> 00:16:20.675
Hey. good work on
those access to capital reviews.

164
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:23.373
-You saw my report?
-Mm-hmm.

165
00:16:23.808 --> 00:16:24.896
Thank you.

166
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.965
Coming in late on a Monday?

167
00:16:51.184 --> 00:16:53.273
Uh. it's before 9:00 a.m.

168
00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:56.711
Junior analysts tend to be
in before their team lead. so.

169
00:16:56.928 --> 00:16:59.322
Okay.
I'll be here earlier tomorrow.

170
00:17:00.062 --> 00:17:01.846
You're very smart.
and you do good work.

171
00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:03.109
Thank you.

172
00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:07.330
You just have some of
the non-tangibles to figure out.

173
00:17:07.504 --> 00:17:10.681
School can't
teach you everything.

174
00:17:10.855 --> 00:17:13.641
I just-- I wanna let you know
that this is my dream job.

175
00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.253
This is not a college.
and I'm not a professor.

176
00:17:17.427 --> 00:17:18.472
Okay?

177
00:17:22.345 --> 00:17:24.260
Trying to match your new plant?

178
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:28.221
Yeah. I don't know.

179
00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:30.266
Okay. well.
You don't see clients.

180
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.834
so you don't need to do...
all this.

181
00:17:34.575 --> 00:17:35.706
Okay.

182
00:17:36.664 --> 00:17:39.797
Uh. break down these financials
before end of day.

183
00:17:40.015 --> 00:17:42.844
Uh. if you see any red flags.
make sure to note it.

184
00:17:43.062 --> 00:17:44.063
Okay.

185
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.848
Okay.

186
00:17:50.112 --> 00:17:51.244
Hey. Lori?

187
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.474
-Hey.
-What's up?

188
00:18:05.388 --> 00:18:06.694
What did Borey-Lori want?

189
00:18:06.868 --> 00:18:08.957
She said I shouldn't
dress like this.

190
00:18:09.175 --> 00:18:10.263
What. hot?

191
00:18:10.915 --> 00:18:12.091
You're stupid.

192
00:18:13.222 --> 00:18:14.267
You dress like that for me?

193
00:18:16.007 --> 00:18:17.226
Matched the flower you got me.

194
00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:20.011
Oh.

195
00:18:20.186 --> 00:18:21.665
Yeah. I get it.

196
00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:28.019
Uh...

197
00:18:28.194 --> 00:18:29.282
what's with the. um...

198
00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:31.806
I took the condom off.

199
00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.504
What?

200
00:18:36.767 --> 00:18:37.855
Wait. did you--

201
00:18:38.378 --> 00:18:39.814
-Inside?
-How did you not--

202
00:18:40.293 --> 00:18:42.773
Wait. seriously?

203
00:18:45.863 --> 00:18:48.388
Uh. do you wanna
get lunch today?

204
00:18:48.605 --> 00:18:50.129
-Like. just me and you?
-You...

205
00:18:50.825 --> 00:18:52.131
have to take the pill.

206
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.525
Can we talk during lunch?

207
00:18:58.311 --> 00:19:00.400
I was thinking...

208
00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:02.184
you could suck my dick at lunch?

209
00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:08.277
What the fuck is wrong with you?

210
00:19:10.323 --> 00:19:12.325
I just wanna
talk about Saturday.

211
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:16.503
Sir.

212
00:19:16.677 --> 00:19:18.940
I-- I can't.
I'm actually with a client--

213
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.682
That is
the VP of Acquisitions.

214
00:19:21.899 --> 00:19:24.815
Unprofessional bullshit.
I thought we liked each other.

215
00:19:24.989 --> 00:19:26.165
I do.

216
00:19:28.776 --> 00:19:31.866
This is what I fucking hate.
This is fucking bullshit.

217
00:21:30.114 --> 00:21:31.202
Hera?

218
00:21:33.727 --> 00:21:34.989
Hera. is that you?

219
00:21:37.513 --> 00:21:38.558
Hera?

220
00:21:40.516 --> 00:21:41.561
Hera?

221
00:21:46.261 --> 00:21:47.871
Why didn't you say anything?

222
00:21:48.524 --> 00:21:53.399
Weirdo. Um. hey. uh.
so. got anything good?

223
00:21:54.617 --> 00:21:57.228
I. um... ...I just
finished the last of mine.

224
00:21:57.403 --> 00:22:00.231
I stayed up late as fuck
last night. so...

225
00:22:02.451 --> 00:22:03.583
Oh. you're crying.

226
00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:05.976
Um...

227
00:22:06.629 --> 00:22:09.545
I was taking allergy medicine.

228
00:22:15.551 --> 00:22:17.988
Uh. anyways. so. you really
shouldn't cry at work.

229
00:22:18.989 --> 00:22:21.165
About work. or...

230
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.429
boys. or whatever.

231
00:22:24.734 --> 00:22:26.083
They'll eat you alive.

232
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:28.129
Any one of them.

233
00:22:29.913 --> 00:22:31.393
We're all carnivores here.

234
00:22:41.882 --> 00:22:42.926
Bye.

235
00:23:07.473 --> 00:23:09.475
Vicky?

236
00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:11.085
Vicky. I don't like this.

237
00:24:24.332 --> 00:24:25.899
90 days.

238
00:24:27.161 --> 00:24:28.205
You nervous?

239
00:24:29.598 --> 00:24:32.122
No. I was just
thinking about something.

240
00:24:32.732 --> 00:24:33.776
An account?

241
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:35.865
Yeah.

242
00:24:37.171 --> 00:24:38.738
You're nervous. It's okay.

243
00:24:38.955 --> 00:24:41.175
I'm the big dog. and I'm scary.

244
00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:42.742
Except I'm not.

245
00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:45.005
-I hope I didn't offend you.
-Offend me?

246
00:24:45.179 --> 00:24:48.487
I have some pretty thick skin.

247
00:24:50.097 --> 00:24:51.533
You don't have to
be afraid of me.

248
00:24:51.968 --> 00:24:55.276
If you make money. I win.
Your success is my success.

249
00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.713
So. I just want us to be
on the same page. right?

250
00:24:57.931 --> 00:24:59.019
Right.

251
00:24:59.236 --> 00:25:00.542
So. tell me. what's going on?

252
00:25:02.675 --> 00:25:03.719
With me?

253
00:25:07.114 --> 00:25:09.377
I'm good. Yeah.

254
00:25:09.812 --> 00:25:10.857
You think?

255
00:25:11.945 --> 00:25:13.990
Yeah. I think I'm good.

256
00:25:17.646 --> 00:25:18.865
Crushing it.

257
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:21.955
-Really?
-Absolutely.

258
00:25:22.129 --> 00:25:24.697
-So this is your first job ever?
-Yeah.

259
00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:29.789
I mean. I worked at a coffee
shop during college. but...

260
00:25:29.963 --> 00:25:31.747
I'd love for you
to make me a latte sometime.

261
00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:36.447
Yeah. sure.

262
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.319
I'm gonna be honest.

263
00:25:38.493 --> 00:25:40.582
I don't actually know
what's in a latte.

264
00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:44.760
Uh. espresso and steamed milk.

265
00:25:45.326 --> 00:25:46.414
How much?

266
00:25:47.241 --> 00:25:48.198
Sorry?

267
00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:49.460
How much espresso.

268
00:25:49.635 --> 00:25:50.679
how much steamed milk?

269
00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:54.640
I'm not sure.

270
00:25:54.814 --> 00:25:57.817
You must know an amount.
Even a ballpark. Any amount.

271
00:25:58.992 --> 00:26:03.126
Two espresso
and a cup of steamed milk.

272
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.346
So. how much liquid
is in a shot.

273
00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:07.696
and how much
does milk cost in bulk?

274
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.394
I'm not sure.

275
00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:17.314
So much of what we do is
an imperfect exact science.

276
00:26:17.532 --> 00:26:19.273
In order to forecast
for our client.

277
00:26:19.447 --> 00:26:20.970
you need to know
what it is they do.

278
00:26:21.188 --> 00:26:23.103
For example. latte.

279
00:26:23.277 --> 00:26:26.759
Maintenance.
overhead. variable costs.

280
00:26:27.498 --> 00:26:29.675
We need to know
what they're capable of.

281
00:26:29.849 --> 00:26:32.286
I just didn't know
the measurements of the coffee--

282
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.810
It's okay.
I believe that you worked there.

283
00:26:35.245 --> 00:26:38.031
I trust you. because deep down.

284
00:26:38.248 --> 00:26:39.859
I know what you're capable of.

285
00:26:40.337 --> 00:26:44.646
Risk is the possibility
of something bad happening.

286
00:26:45.429 --> 00:26:48.389
And if you know the outcome.
even if it's bad.

287
00:26:48.563 --> 00:26:50.217
then there is no risk.

288
00:26:50.391 --> 00:26:54.743
And trust alleviates
a ton of risk.

289
00:26:55.178 --> 00:26:56.266
And I trust you.

290
00:26:56.832 --> 00:26:57.833
Do you trust me?

291
00:26:58.051 --> 00:26:59.443
-Yeah.
-Don't just say it

292
00:26:59.661 --> 00:27:00.662
because I'm your boss's boss.

293
00:27:00.836 --> 00:27:02.316
-Do you trust me?
-Yes.

294
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.970
-Yes?
-Yes.

295
00:27:04.144 --> 00:27:07.016
-Yes? Yes? Yes?
-Yes. Yes. Yes!

296
00:27:07.234 --> 00:27:08.496
All right. You're free to go.

297
00:27:11.107 --> 00:27:12.282
What?

298
00:27:12.761 --> 00:27:15.764
That was me approving
your 90-day onboarding.

299
00:27:15.938 --> 00:27:18.027
Congrats.
You're still on board. kid.

300
00:27:19.942 --> 00:27:22.379
Thank you.

301
00:27:27.994 --> 00:27:29.517
-Hey!
-Hey. hey!

302
00:27:29.691 --> 00:27:31.867
-Corey! Hi!
-Aunt Hera. I missed you!

303
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:34.783
-Tell me "I missed you too."
-I missed you guys.

304
00:27:34.957 --> 00:27:37.699
-How's it going?
-Good. How are you?

305
00:27:38.787 --> 00:27:40.789
Aww.
Are you excited for tonight?

306
00:27:41.007 --> 00:27:42.573
-Yes.
-Yeah. me too.

307
00:27:42.748 --> 00:27:44.314
-Awesome.
-All right.

308
00:27:47.753 --> 00:27:50.059
You know. when you said you were
making lasagna. I thought...

309
00:27:51.321 --> 00:27:53.672
well. I just thought
you'd be making it.

310
00:27:53.889 --> 00:27:55.064
I don't have time to cook.

311
00:27:55.499 --> 00:27:57.197
Oh. yeah. I get you're busy.

312
00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:01.592
You know. when I was 23.
I was pregnant.

313
00:28:02.463 --> 00:28:05.858
Working. married. cleaned.

314
00:28:06.075 --> 00:28:07.729
I'm in a really
competitive field.

315
00:28:08.208 --> 00:28:10.166
Okay?
If I don't advance quickly.

316
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.472
then I'll just get stuck.

317
00:28:12.734 --> 00:28:13.996
There's a glass ceiling.

318
00:28:14.518 --> 00:28:17.043
You're 23. relax. You're fine.

319
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.653
I want to make C-suite.

320
00:28:19.436 --> 00:28:21.221
I don't wanna just
have some nothing job.

321
00:28:26.835 --> 00:28:28.184
When you come over next week.

322
00:28:28.358 --> 00:28:29.925
I'll show you
some of mom's old recipes.

323
00:28:30.665 --> 00:28:33.886
I don't even remember
what they tasted like.

324
00:28:34.451 --> 00:28:36.410
It doesn't matter.
You need to learn how to cook.

325
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.369
And clean. for God's sake.

326
00:28:39.587 --> 00:28:41.284
You moved in here.
what. three months ago?

327
00:28:41.632 --> 00:28:44.287
Still looks like there's
spiderwebs from the last person.

328
00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:47.029
Corey... how was school?

329
00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:49.815
Did they like your pigtails?

330
00:28:51.077 --> 00:28:53.514
A boy pulled my hair. Aunt Hera.

331
00:28:53.688 --> 00:28:54.733
That means he likes you.

332
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.561
Her dad used to pull her hair.

333
00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:59.085
Don't say shit like that.

334
00:29:01.957 --> 00:29:03.002
Are you drawing something?

335
00:29:05.178 --> 00:29:06.222
Can I see?

336
00:29:10.879 --> 00:29:11.924
What is it?

337
00:29:13.447 --> 00:29:15.014
A plant pod for you.

338
00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:18.582
A plant pod?

339
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.236
Miss Deven.

340
00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:22.761
She died last week.

341
00:29:22.978 --> 00:29:25.111
Oh. yeah. I'm sorry. honey.

342
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.723
My teacher says
they put her in a bag

343
00:29:28.941 --> 00:29:31.030
so her body can become flowers.

344
00:29:32.074 --> 00:29:33.772
Okay. that's enough.

345
00:29:34.337 --> 00:29:36.209
God. what are they
telling these kids?

346
00:29:36.383 --> 00:29:37.688
Why did you draw me?

347
00:29:40.517 --> 00:29:42.606
Because flowers grow.

348
00:29:51.006 --> 00:29:52.442
Actually.
this lasagna's real good.

349
00:30:02.104 --> 00:30:03.627
Hera.

350
00:30:15.596 --> 00:30:17.119
Hey.
I should only be a few hours.

351
00:30:17.293 --> 00:30:19.687
-This guy seems like a dud.
-How do you know?

352
00:30:20.906 --> 00:30:22.385
You can tell by his pics.

353
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:25.388
He's cute. but he's.
like. hiking and kayaking.

354
00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:29.871
But he's got a good job
and no kids. so. just drinks.

355
00:30:30.045 --> 00:30:33.701
I won't feel pressure to...

356
00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:36.008
All right. Well. how do I look?

357
00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.837
You look great.

358
00:30:49.543 --> 00:30:50.544
Corey?

359
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.244
Corey?

360
00:30:58.857 --> 00:30:59.901
Come out.

361
00:31:20.443 --> 00:31:22.793
Corey. what are you doing?

362
00:31:27.973 --> 00:31:29.931
Is this about
what your teacher taught you?

363
00:31:48.297 --> 00:31:50.734
Oh. my God. No...

364
00:32:01.832 --> 00:32:03.922
-Hey.
-Hey.

365
00:32:04.139 --> 00:32:05.793
How'd it go?

366
00:32:05.967 --> 00:32:08.100
Eh. you know...

367
00:32:10.276 --> 00:32:11.581
I thought he was a dud.

368
00:32:12.452 --> 00:32:13.888
He was.

369
00:32:14.106 --> 00:32:16.978
But he was really sweet
and kinda hot. so...

370
00:32:17.544 --> 00:32:19.850
we did stuff in his car.

371
00:32:20.025 --> 00:32:21.330
Is that what you wanted?

372
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.768
Yeah. I-- I told him I didn't
think it was gonna work out.

373
00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:26.770
and he was just saying
he liked me.

374
00:32:27.249 --> 00:32:28.468
I don't know. it was cute.

375
00:32:28.642 --> 00:32:30.252
so I told him
what I wanted to do.

376
00:32:30.818 --> 00:32:31.993
He was cool with that.

377
00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:35.301
Might happen again.

378
00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:37.172
Corey? You ready?

379
00:32:41.263 --> 00:32:42.569
I didn't do anything wrong.

380
00:32:43.787 --> 00:32:44.919
I know.

381
00:32:45.398 --> 00:32:47.313
I had fun. I'm allowed to.

382
00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:52.753
I meant to tell you
about the guy at work.

383
00:32:53.319 --> 00:32:56.148
-The higher-up.
-Oh. the higher-up? Second date?

384
00:32:56.322 --> 00:32:57.627
Corey?

385
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.674
Well. we went out. um...

386
00:33:01.501 --> 00:33:03.590
and then he dropped me off.

387
00:33:03.764 --> 00:33:05.113
I'm sorry. what are you saying?

388
00:33:10.162 --> 00:33:12.599
I'm just really sad
he doesn't like me anymore.

389
00:33:14.383 --> 00:33:16.037
Like. he won't even talk to me.

390
00:33:20.128 --> 00:33:22.087
Oh. Hera.

391
00:33:22.261 --> 00:33:23.436
What a prick.

392
00:33:24.132 --> 00:33:25.568
They can all be such assholes.

393
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:29.572
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

394
00:33:29.746 --> 00:33:30.878
Okay.

395
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.662
Where the hell is Corey?

396
00:33:33.228 --> 00:33:35.491
She fell asleep next to me.

397
00:33:36.492 --> 00:33:37.537
How long ago?

398
00:33:39.278 --> 00:33:41.671
-I fell asleep too.
-Oh. my--

399
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:43.717
Corey.

400
00:33:45.284 --> 00:33:46.328
Corey!

401
00:33:52.204 --> 00:33:53.814
-Corey. you in here?
-Mom?

402
00:33:58.166 --> 00:33:59.602
I saw the tree man.

403
00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.736
Oh. baby. it's okay.
Time to go home.

404
00:34:05.217 --> 00:34:06.479
You saw a tree man?

405
00:34:06.653 --> 00:34:08.698
Are you feeding
into this with her?

406
00:34:08.872 --> 00:34:10.700
No more of this tree man stuff!

407
00:34:11.223 --> 00:34:12.920
God. this is exactly
why I feel so alone.

408
00:34:13.138 --> 00:34:15.575
I have to do everything on
my own. and what are you doing?

409
00:34:17.229 --> 00:34:19.709
Come on. Corey.

410
00:34:19.883 --> 00:34:21.842
-Love you.
-Love you.

411
00:35:17.202 --> 00:35:19.073
She looks like a dock worker.

412
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.329
Frank. I got that email.

413
00:36:41.503 --> 00:36:43.679
Tea time at 8:00.
I'm gonna whoop your ass.

414
00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:47.683
Zach?

415
00:37:21.891 --> 00:37:22.979
Zach.

416
00:37:31.684 --> 00:37:33.338
...over our projections
for this year.

417
00:37:33.512 --> 00:37:35.601
and I think as we move forward.
what we--

418
00:37:42.085 --> 00:37:43.478
Hera.

419
00:37:43.652 --> 00:37:45.437
Did you have
the conference room booked?

420
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:47.308
No.

421
00:37:48.222 --> 00:37:50.355
I just--
I had a question for Zach.

422
00:37:51.312 --> 00:37:53.140
-Sorry to interrupt you guys.
-Okay.

423
00:37:53.314 --> 00:37:54.881
-Back to business. then.
-What?

424
00:37:58.624 --> 00:37:59.668
What did you wanna know?

425
00:38:01.975 --> 00:38:03.063
Uh...

426
00:38:04.238 --> 00:38:05.283
Come on.

427
00:38:06.762 --> 00:38:07.807
Center of the room.

428
00:38:09.417 --> 00:38:10.462
Go on.

429
00:38:12.115 --> 00:38:13.203
Ask.

430
00:38:13.726 --> 00:38:15.249
Can you help me with something?

431
00:38:16.337 --> 00:38:17.425
What?

432
00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:21.821
Uh. I'm working on
some models for Lori.

433
00:38:22.038 --> 00:38:24.040
Um. I just-- I need your help--

434
00:38:24.214 --> 00:38:25.868
Hera.
what exactly do you wanna know?

435
00:38:30.177 --> 00:38:33.528
Capital asset
expected return rate.

436
00:38:33.702 --> 00:38:35.878
Couldn't look it up?

437
00:38:41.841 --> 00:38:44.322
Risk-free rate
plus market sensitivity

438
00:38:44.539 --> 00:38:46.889
times difference
between expected return

439
00:38:47.063 --> 00:38:48.021
and risk-free rate.

440
00:38:48.238 --> 00:38:50.632
Thank you.

441
00:38:53.156 --> 00:38:54.201
You can leave now.

442
00:38:55.898 --> 00:38:56.943
Sorry.

443
00:39:04.429 --> 00:39:06.344
All right. let's talk about Q3.

444
00:39:25.101 --> 00:39:26.364
Oh. Hey.

445
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:30.759
Don't feel bad.
It was just a joke.

446
00:39:31.804 --> 00:39:33.371
Didn't feel like a joke.

447
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.896
I knew this was gonna happen.

448
00:39:38.941 --> 00:39:42.728
I don't know why we hire women
who don't plan on becoming CFAs.

449
00:39:42.902 --> 00:39:44.164
You know I want to.

450
00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:48.081
Yeah. but what else do you want?

451
00:39:51.563 --> 00:39:53.652
I thought you were special.

452
00:39:53.826 --> 00:39:56.437
Boy. was I wrong.

453
00:40:00.354 --> 00:40:03.270
You ever-- ever
think about being a teacher?

454
00:40:04.837 --> 00:40:06.012
Maybe a nurse?

455
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.320
You could--
Oh. you could marry a rich guy.

456
00:40:10.495 --> 00:40:11.931
I mean. you're hot. so...

457
00:40:12.105 --> 00:40:13.193
Yeah.

458
00:40:13.846 --> 00:40:16.196
Be a nice little
stay-at-home-mom.

459
00:40:19.895 --> 00:40:22.507
Oh. shit.
Is that what this is about?

460
00:40:23.116 --> 00:40:27.337
-I want this.
-Yeah. you aren't good at this.

461
00:40:32.299 --> 00:40:33.387
Zach...

462
00:40:35.215 --> 00:40:36.390
What?

463
00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:39.959
Did you--
did you still want. um...

464
00:40:41.917 --> 00:40:43.397
At lunch in y-- in your car?

465
00:40:53.059 --> 00:40:54.103
Did you take the pill?

466
00:40:56.105 --> 00:40:57.150
Yesterday.

467
00:41:03.809 --> 00:41:05.463
I think it'd be weird if we...

468
00:41:07.508 --> 00:41:08.901
I mean. we're coworkers. right?

469
00:41:09.945 --> 00:41:11.251
So. uh...

470
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:13.775
Yeah.
and I got stuff to do today.

471
00:41:16.822 --> 00:41:17.910
What. are you gonna cry?

472
00:41:28.747 --> 00:41:29.791
Bless you.

473
00:41:46.982 --> 00:41:48.244
Fucking women. man.

474
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.719
Hey. hey!

475
00:42:28.415 --> 00:42:30.286
Lori. I am so sorry!

476
00:42:30.722 --> 00:42:32.201
Can I help you?

477
00:42:32.375 --> 00:42:33.899
I thought you were
somebody else. I'm so sorry!

478
00:42:34.116 --> 00:42:36.554
Go to the breakout room. Now!

479
00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:46.564
I'm so--

480
00:42:50.655 --> 00:42:51.743
Hera.

481
00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:55.355
-What is going on with you?
-I'm sorry.

482
00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:57.400
Yesterday the dress
and today this.

483
00:42:57.575 --> 00:42:58.793
And you didn't
give me a breakdown!

484
00:42:58.967 --> 00:43:00.708
Ah!

485
00:43:01.143 --> 00:43:02.536
-Hello?
-Um...

486
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.886
I know. It was late.
I was trying to. um...

487
00:43:06.453 --> 00:43:08.368
-I'm sorry.
-Do not say sorry again.

488
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:12.633
Don't.

489
00:43:12.807 --> 00:43:15.593
I asked Zach for help with
one of the equations.

490
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:18.334
-That's why it was late.
-Don't do that!

491
00:43:18.508 --> 00:43:19.858
Ask the guys for help?

492
00:43:20.075 --> 00:43:21.990
You either do the work
or you're let go.

493
00:43:23.383 --> 00:43:26.125
-We don't get to make mistakes.
-Okay. I'm sorry.

494
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.518
That's the last time.

495
00:43:43.838 --> 00:43:45.274
-Hey.
-Hey.

496
00:43:45.492 --> 00:43:46.667
I thought you couldn't
talk at work?

497
00:43:47.537 --> 00:43:49.627
-I walked away from my desk.
-Cool.

498
00:43:49.844 --> 00:43:52.934
Well. I'm at the hospital.
so I can't talk long.

499
00:43:55.023 --> 00:43:56.198
Hera?

500
00:43:57.504 --> 00:43:58.636
Hera?

501
00:43:59.549 --> 00:44:01.769
I didn't know who else to call.

502
00:44:01.943 --> 00:44:03.379
I-- I don't know what I'm doing.

503
00:44:03.553 --> 00:44:04.903
Okay? This is so hard.

504
00:44:05.077 --> 00:44:06.905
This is so hard.
I don't know what I'm doing.

505
00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:09.124
Just take a breath. It's okay.

506
00:44:09.864 --> 00:44:11.692
No one's gonna die
if you mess up.

507
00:44:11.866 --> 00:44:12.911
It's okay.

508
00:44:16.044 --> 00:44:18.917
-Yeah.
-Bad stuff happens. but...

509
00:44:19.961 --> 00:44:21.484
we can't just stop
because of it.

510
00:44:22.616 --> 00:44:25.880
On to the next patient.
and on to the next. right?

511
00:44:27.403 --> 00:44:28.883
-On to the next.
-Good.

512
00:44:29.101 --> 00:44:30.842
Okay. I really gotta run.

513
00:44:31.494 --> 00:44:33.409
-Love you.
-Love you too. Demi.

514
00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:35.673
Thank you.

515
00:44:50.383 --> 00:44:51.732
Could you get the door for me?

516
00:44:54.387 --> 00:44:57.477
Cute plant.

517
00:44:57.651 --> 00:44:59.218
-Thanks.
-So cute.

518
00:44:59.435 --> 00:45:00.741
I think
I'm gonna call her Grace.

519
00:45:02.264 --> 00:45:03.309
Okay!

520
00:45:04.745 --> 00:45:06.007
It was a gift.

521
00:45:08.923 --> 00:45:10.359
Uh. I like your shoes.

522
00:45:10.533 --> 00:45:12.622
Thank you!

523
00:45:19.978 --> 00:45:21.414
Can you get the door for me?

524
00:45:24.983 --> 00:45:26.680
Oh. You know what?

525
00:45:26.898 --> 00:45:29.727
I'm so sorry. I'm meeting Zach.

526
00:45:30.815 --> 00:45:31.859
Sorry.

527
00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:30.265
I know.

528
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.748
I know.

529
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:44.802
Lasagna.

530
00:47:10.001 --> 00:47:12.177
Do you want some?

531
00:48:50.014 --> 00:48:51.624
Did you get a new account?

532
00:48:51.798 --> 00:48:54.888
Holy shit. you've been here.
what. three months?

533
00:48:55.062 --> 00:48:56.020
Ring it!

534
00:48:56.237 --> 00:48:59.545
Hey. everyone! Ring it.

535
00:48:59.719 --> 00:49:01.460
-I can't.
-You--

536
00:49:01.634 --> 00:49:03.549
You have to. They expect you to.
You--

537
00:49:03.723 --> 00:49:05.203
We have to
go through with it now.

538
00:49:07.814 --> 00:49:11.122
So. what was the account?
How much was it for?

539
00:49:12.993 --> 00:49:14.081
I didn't.

540
00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:17.302
I just was looking at the bell.

541
00:49:18.477 --> 00:49:19.608
Wha--

542
00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:21.523
Why didn't you say anything?

543
00:49:23.482 --> 00:49:24.962
She's got nothing.

544
00:49:26.354 --> 00:49:28.008
God. you look like an idiot.

545
00:49:40.673 --> 00:49:41.761
Come in.

546
00:49:42.718 --> 00:49:43.806
Hera.

547
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.507
-Good morning. Lori.
-Mmm.

548
00:49:52.598 --> 00:49:54.817
I heard you just got back
from a family trip.

549
00:49:55.775 --> 00:49:57.995
I have time for one trip a year.

550
00:49:58.821 --> 00:50:00.127
Too busy for family. though.

551
00:50:01.694 --> 00:50:03.261
-You doing okay?
-Yeah.

552
00:50:04.436 --> 00:50:07.091
Good. cool. So.
I wanted to talk to you about...

553
00:50:07.265 --> 00:50:09.441
-day and a half late. but--
-I know. I'm sorry. I--

554
00:50:09.615 --> 00:50:11.182
But-- Can I finish?

555
00:50:16.143 --> 00:50:18.145
But you didn't
just do the report.

556
00:50:18.319 --> 00:50:20.539
You did all of it.

557
00:50:20.713 --> 00:50:22.280
The entire thing. Forecasting.

558
00:50:22.454 --> 00:50:25.457
and your risk transfer
recommendations are spot-on.

559
00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:27.285
-Yeah?
-Yes.

560
00:50:28.634 --> 00:50:31.158
We need to find
a happy medium here.

561
00:50:31.811 --> 00:50:33.987
You went from
prom dress to trash can.

562
00:50:35.336 --> 00:50:36.859
And you look sick. Are you sick?

563
00:50:37.469 --> 00:50:38.992
-I'm not sick.
-If you're sick.

564
00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:40.559
you need to tell me.
I can't get sick right now.

565
00:50:40.733 --> 00:50:41.777
I'm not sick.

566
00:50:44.128 --> 00:50:45.129
Okay.

567
00:50:45.303 --> 00:50:46.826
If you can keep doing this.

568
00:50:47.044 --> 00:50:48.697
fit in a bit better.
then in a few months.

569
00:50:48.915 --> 00:50:50.786
we can talk about
funding your CFA classes.

570
00:50:51.004 --> 00:50:52.527
I would love that.

571
00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:55.356
That's exactly what I need
to become a real analyst.

572
00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:57.663
Gabe recommended you
for CFA training.

573
00:50:57.837 --> 00:50:58.968
He said you've been
helping him out.

574
00:51:00.144 --> 00:51:01.188
Gabe did?

575
00:51:01.406 --> 00:51:02.842
Yes. Uh. go check your email.

576
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.844
I sent you and Vicky
some things to review.

577
00:51:05.062 --> 00:51:09.109
-Vicky?
-Yes. Your little plant buddy?

578
00:51:09.283 --> 00:51:11.503
Are you having trouble hearing?
Do you not hear well?

579
00:51:11.677 --> 00:51:12.982
I can hear well.

580
00:51:13.635 --> 00:51:15.855
Okay. Uh.
it's not. like. a sinus thing?

581
00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:18.075
Because your face
does look puffy.

582
00:51:19.293 --> 00:51:21.165
-I'm not sick.
-Okay.

583
00:51:21.339 --> 00:51:23.036
You must have hearing loss.
then.

584
00:51:23.558 --> 00:51:25.560
Because you rang
that fucking bell.

585
00:51:29.042 --> 00:51:30.174
You can shut that.

586
00:51:46.364 --> 00:51:48.540
Oh. hey. Come on in.

587
00:51:49.758 --> 00:51:51.282
-Hey.
-Hey. Shut the door.

588
00:52:00.769 --> 00:52:03.859
So Lori told me that you
recommended me for CFA classes?

589
00:52:04.077 --> 00:52:05.905
Oh. absolutely.
You're crushing it.

590
00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:07.428
Thanks.

591
00:52:07.602 --> 00:52:09.474
We haven't worked
together at all.

592
00:52:12.346 --> 00:52:13.695
Look. I'm gonna be honest.

593
00:52:15.567 --> 00:52:17.351
Zach and I tag-team accounts.

594
00:52:17.525 --> 00:52:19.788
so I've seen your work.

595
00:52:20.485 --> 00:52:22.356
He goes in and schmoozes.

596
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:24.663
and I do
the actual heavy lifting.

597
00:52:25.316 --> 00:52:26.360
Then we both win.

598
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:29.624
You're not Ivy League

599
00:52:29.842 --> 00:52:31.887
like Zach. Vicky.

600
00:52:32.584 --> 00:52:33.802
a bunch of people.

601
00:52:36.022 --> 00:52:37.502
Ivy Leaguers play the game.

602
00:52:37.937 --> 00:52:39.504
They don't put in the hours.

603
00:52:40.592 --> 00:52:41.984
And...

604
00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.292
Zach told me that things didn't
work out between you two.

605
00:52:45.901 --> 00:52:49.166
Should I go to HR
about what happened?

606
00:52:49.383 --> 00:52:51.646
No. Don't go to HR.

607
00:52:52.647 --> 00:52:56.999
I mean. if my wife or daughter
were in your situation?

608
00:52:57.174 --> 00:52:58.653
Jesus.

609
00:52:58.871 --> 00:53:02.744
All right. HR's job is
to protect the company.

610
00:53:02.918 --> 00:53:04.355
You go to them and tell them

611
00:53:04.529 --> 00:53:06.226
that you had a fling
that went bad?

612
00:53:07.227 --> 00:53:08.837
Who do you think
they're gonna take care of--

613
00:53:09.055 --> 00:53:11.536
and I'm just being honest here--

614
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:12.928
a top earner.

615
00:53:13.102 --> 00:53:16.236
or a female junior analyst?

616
00:53:24.244 --> 00:53:26.507
I just want you to
get the help that you deserve.

617
00:53:26.986 --> 00:53:29.554
because it's hard enough
being a woman in the workplace.

618
00:53:36.909 --> 00:53:39.651
That's really awesome of you.
Gabe.

619
00:53:40.434 --> 00:53:42.088
Us state-schoolers
gotta stick together.

620
00:53:45.352 --> 00:53:46.527
Thank you.

621
00:54:16.775 --> 00:54:19.865
-Jesus!
-Don't touch my plant.

622
00:54:20.039 --> 00:54:21.562
Are you being serious right now?

623
00:54:24.957 --> 00:54:26.524
Why do you have
the same plant as me?

624
00:54:26.698 --> 00:54:31.093
Oh. well.
I went to the grocery store.

625
00:54:31.268 --> 00:54:34.967
Your little plant cost $12.

626
00:54:39.841 --> 00:54:41.190
I'm here now. What do you want?

627
00:54:41.843 --> 00:54:44.585
Oh. Do you wanna go to lunch?

628
00:54:44.803 --> 00:54:46.413
Zach and I are going to lunch.

629
00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:48.633
Except...

630
00:54:49.373 --> 00:54:51.462
I'm actually hungry.

631
00:54:55.944 --> 00:54:57.337
Ow. Jesus!

632
00:54:59.861 --> 00:55:02.603
What the fuck is wrong with you?

633
00:55:07.956 --> 00:55:09.654
Hera just pulled my hair.

634
00:55:09.871 --> 00:55:13.048
Hera just hit me.
and now my neck hurts!

635
00:55:13.484 --> 00:55:15.007
Are you okay?

636
00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:17.357
I don't know!

637
00:55:17.531 --> 00:55:19.228
I don't know
what is going on with you

638
00:55:19.403 --> 00:55:22.580
or what kind of psychotic break
that you're having.

639
00:55:22.797 --> 00:55:25.496
but I-- I'm going to sue you.

640
00:55:26.105 --> 00:55:28.760
and you need to get help.

641
00:55:28.934 --> 00:55:30.457
God. my neck really hurts

642
00:55:30.675 --> 00:55:31.806
and I don't know--

643
00:55:40.032 --> 00:55:41.773
What the fuck?

644
00:57:16.998 --> 00:57:18.826
I want this to fucking hurt.

645
00:57:23.831 --> 00:57:25.398
I fucking hate you!

646
00:57:34.146 --> 00:57:37.932
Yeah! Whoo!

647
00:57:40.021 --> 00:57:43.677
Is everyone seeing this? Whoo!

648
00:58:06.874 --> 00:58:09.398
Stop.

649
00:58:10.617 --> 00:58:11.879
Stop!

650
00:58:12.837 --> 00:58:13.925
Stop!

651
00:58:14.186 --> 00:58:16.536
Stop. stop!

652
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:19.496
Stop. stop. stop. Stop--

653
00:58:25.893 --> 00:58:26.938
What's going on?

654
00:58:31.072 --> 00:58:32.117
I fell asleep.

655
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:34.859
You can't sleep here.

656
00:58:35.033 --> 00:58:36.687
And we talked about
how you're dressed.

657
00:58:37.688 --> 00:58:39.864
Do you have
a learning disability?

658
00:58:41.909 --> 00:58:43.607
It's okay if you do. but we
need to talk about options for--

659
00:58:43.824 --> 00:58:45.086
What the fuck is this?

660
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:48.002
Vicky. what's going on?

661
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.529
Did you do this. Hera?

662
00:58:54.748 --> 00:58:57.011
Did you fucking do this. Hera?

663
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:01.886
I come into my office.
my plant is dead.

664
00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.627
it's swimming in salt.

665
00:59:03.801 --> 00:59:06.673
and my trash bin
is full of salt packets.

666
00:59:07.108 --> 00:59:08.501
Wonder how that happened. Hera?

667
00:59:08.675 --> 00:59:09.763
Hera?

668
00:59:11.025 --> 00:59:13.680
-I-- I don't know.
-This is bullshit.

669
00:59:15.552 --> 00:59:17.118
I'm gonna rip yours apart.

670
00:59:18.903 --> 00:59:19.947
Don't.

671
00:59:28.608 --> 00:59:30.305
Oh. my God!

672
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:36.442
What the fuck is wrong with you?

673
00:59:36.616 --> 00:59:37.748
Oh. my God.

674
00:59:44.058 --> 00:59:46.539
Oh. my God!

675
00:59:49.498 --> 00:59:53.851
Oh. my God! Oh. God!

676
00:59:54.678 --> 00:59:56.984
What the fuck is wrong with you?

677
01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:04.296
You okay?

678
01:00:06.037 --> 01:00:07.691
Is it cool if
I sit with you for a minute?

679
01:00:14.872 --> 01:00:16.003
Crazy morning.

680
01:00:18.571 --> 01:00:19.877
Vicky's kind of a bitch.

681
01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:26.231
I get why you're mad.
She's hooking up with Zach.

682
01:00:27.406 --> 01:00:28.537
It's just so shitty.

683
01:00:29.364 --> 01:00:30.452
It sucks.

684
01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.809
Plus. that stupid flower thing
he does with every girl?

685
01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:41.681
-It's not stupid.
-No. no.

686
01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:43.291
Yeah. I mean...

687
01:00:43.901 --> 01:00:44.945
yours is great.

688
01:00:48.819 --> 01:00:50.124
Do you wanna give Zach
his jacket back?

689
01:01:07.838 --> 01:01:08.969
You know. uh.

690
01:01:09.753 --> 01:01:13.931
I can intro you
to some other firms.

691
01:01:14.105 --> 01:01:16.629
You're a talented analyst.
and they'd be down to meet.

692
01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:19.545
Thanks.

693
01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:25.507
You wanna get coffee and
we can talk about it some time?

694
01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:28.336
Dinner?

695
01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:30.861
Whatever.

696
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:34.125
Do you need money?

697
01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.604
'‘Cause I can give you money.

698
01:01:37.128 --> 01:01:39.696
I can give you $1.000.

699
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:42.089
It just has to be our secret.

700
01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:52.491
-Is that a yes?
-Don't touch me.

701
01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.188
-I was just--
-Leave me alone.

702
01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:33.619
Why?

703
01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.405
Why?

704
01:02:38.406 --> 01:02:42.323
What am I supposed to do now?

705
01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:48.199
What am I supposed to do now?

706
01:02:54.074 --> 01:02:56.076
What am I gonna do now?

707
01:02:59.079 --> 01:03:01.865
What do you want?

708
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.086
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

709
01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:11.004
Do you think that
this is some kind of joke?

710
01:03:16.401 --> 01:03:18.533
I know a joke.

711
01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:23.234
Fuck!

712
01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:41.948
Yes!

713
01:03:48.302 --> 01:03:49.869
I'll kill everything.

714
01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.219
and I'll make you watch!

715
01:03:54.526 --> 01:03:56.354
I'm a carnivore too!

716
01:03:58.747 --> 01:04:01.185
I hate you!

717
01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:11.064
Yeah!

718
01:07:24.257 --> 01:07:26.259
-All right. you stay in the car.
-But Mom--

719
01:07:36.704 --> 01:07:37.792
Hera?

720
01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:40.317
Hera!

721
01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:47.889
Mom!

722
01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.891
Come on...

723
01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.198
Come on. Hera.

724
01:07:52.372 --> 01:07:53.939
Please don't be dead.

725
01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.166
Hera?

726
01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.472
Hera. I see you in there.

727
01:08:05.994 --> 01:08:07.431
Hera. let me the fuck in.

728
01:08:18.137 --> 01:08:19.747
What are you doing?

729
01:08:21.967 --> 01:08:23.099
I'’m breathing.

730
01:08:24.535 --> 01:08:25.579
Ugh!

731
01:08:26.972 --> 01:08:28.278
God!

732
01:08:53.303 --> 01:08:54.695
Do you wanna tell me
what's going on?

733
01:08:55.261 --> 01:08:57.437
Tell me. because this is crazy.

734
01:08:58.264 --> 01:08:59.396
You didn't come over
for Monday dinner.

735
01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:01.180
You haven't answered your phone.

736
01:09:01.354 --> 01:09:04.531
Work said you got let go
last week for stabbing someone?

737
01:09:04.705 --> 01:09:06.707
She attacked Grace.

738
01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:09.319
-What?
-She attacked Grace!

739
01:09:11.103 --> 01:09:12.409
My flower.

740
01:09:13.801 --> 01:09:14.889
Mine.

741
01:09:16.369 --> 01:09:17.457
Where is it?

742
01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:20.330
Or is it with the trees
you keep talking about?

743
01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:22.767
Do you know
how fucking hard it is

744
01:09:22.984 --> 01:09:24.986
to barely have time
to be a single mom.

745
01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.858
and work 60 hours a week.

746
01:09:27.032 --> 01:09:28.947
and take care of
an adult fucking woman?

747
01:09:35.432 --> 01:09:37.260
Crap.
I have to take Corey to therapy.

748
01:09:39.958 --> 01:09:42.917
-It's fine.
-Grace! Grace!

749
01:09:50.447 --> 01:09:51.970
He told me to do it.

750
01:09:58.542 --> 01:09:59.673
Hera?

751
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.634
Hera? Oh. my God.
You okay? You okay?

752
01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:06.245
What the fuck is wrong with you?

753
01:10:09.161 --> 01:10:10.815
Hera. what the fuck?

754
01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:13.383
Oh. my God.

755
01:10:14.427 --> 01:10:16.951
I'm taking your keys away.

756
01:10:20.781 --> 01:10:23.697
Can you help her?

757
01:11:09.613 --> 01:11:12.093
Zach!

758
01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:16.054
Zach! Zach! Zach!

759
01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:24.845
Zach?

760
01:11:26.107 --> 01:11:28.284
Zach? Zach.

761
01:11:29.981 --> 01:11:31.069
Vicky.

762
01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.811
Vicky. where'’s Zach?

763
01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:35.465
-I don't know.
-Where'’s Zach?

764
01:11:35.639 --> 01:11:37.031
I don'’t know.
he doesn't talk to me anymore!

765
01:11:37.205 --> 01:11:39.469
-Where is he?
-Hera. stop! What is going on?

766
01:11:39.643 --> 01:11:42.123
Please. I need Zach.
I'll do whatever he wants.

767
01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.256
but Grace.
she's ours and she'’s dying!

768
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.127
What the fuck
are you talking about?

769
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.738
You need to get out of here.

770
01:11:47.912 --> 01:11:49.696
It is a fucking plant!

771
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:53.134
He made me take
the morning-after pill.

772
01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:54.919
but Grace. she's dying.

773
01:11:55.093 --> 01:11:57.400
I need someone to help her!

774
01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.272
Now. listen.

775
01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:02.492
I'll be good to you.
I'm gonna be good to you.

776
01:12:02.666 --> 01:12:04.320
but you need to leave
or I'm calling the cops

777
01:12:04.494 --> 01:12:07.018
and slapping a restraining order
on your ass. Do you hear me?

778
01:12:09.716 --> 01:12:13.111
Okay. Okay.

779
01:12:53.456 --> 01:12:54.935
Do you wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?

780
01:12:57.329 --> 01:12:58.983
Where are we going?

781
01:12:59.157 --> 01:13:00.201
My house.

782
01:13:02.552 --> 01:13:03.814
I wanna go home.

783
01:13:03.988 --> 01:13:05.816
Why the fuck
would I take you there?

784
01:13:06.033 --> 01:13:07.818
So you can make me leave work
in the middle of the day again?

785
01:13:11.691 --> 01:13:12.736
The higher-up...

786
01:13:15.782 --> 01:13:17.349
I didn't wanna
have sex with him.

787
01:13:18.655 --> 01:13:20.134
What?

788
01:13:20.961 --> 01:13:22.876
And he made me take
the morning-after pill.

789
01:13:24.748 --> 01:13:26.924
Oh. Hera.
why didn't you tell me?

790
01:13:27.098 --> 01:13:28.839
I tried.

791
01:13:29.013 --> 01:13:30.101
Grace...

792
01:13:32.016 --> 01:13:33.060
The plant.

793
01:13:34.671 --> 01:13:36.150
I loved her so much.

794
01:13:37.674 --> 01:13:39.980
She made me feel like
nothing bad had ever happened.

795
01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.724
I didn't mean to hit Corey.

796
01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:50.208
She'’s been drawing you
flowers ever since it happened.

797
01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:53.603
She feels bad.

798
01:13:54.952 --> 01:13:56.127
She shouldn't feel bad.

799
01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:58.825
No one should ever hit her.
including me.

800
01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:01.698
I'm really sorry.

801
01:14:07.138 --> 01:14:08.705
I really just wanna go home.
though.

802
01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:14.493
I-- I need to clean up
and-- and sleep in my own bed.

803
01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:18.366
I won't do anything stupid.

804
01:14:19.193 --> 01:14:20.368
Okay.

805
01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:23.241
But I'll be over tomorrow
morning to check on you.

806
01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:26.505
You can apologize to Corey.

807
01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:51.503
Goodbye.

808
01:17:09.973 --> 01:17:11.670
I have to go to the bathroom.

809
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:30.227
Coming.

810
01:18:44.023 --> 01:18:46.243
-Hey?
-You good?

811
01:18:48.332 --> 01:18:49.637
Are you drunk?

812
01:18:49.855 --> 01:18:51.901
Uh. a couple of us
went out after work.

813
01:18:54.294 --> 01:18:56.732
Figured I'd come...
check on my girl.

814
01:18:58.429 --> 01:19:00.170
You-- you okay? You wanna--

815
01:19:00.344 --> 01:19:03.216
-Hey. do you wanna talk about--
-No. not really.

816
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:04.783
I thought I was your mentor.

817
01:19:06.263 --> 01:19:07.307
You need to go.

818
01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.440
Gabe just dropped me off.

819
01:19:10.136 --> 01:19:12.573
You want me to get a ride?
That's gonna be. like. $50.

820
01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:16.099
-I could really use some coffee.
-I don't have any coffee.

821
01:19:17.274 --> 01:19:18.318
Okay.

822
01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:20.538
All right.

823
01:19:21.191 --> 01:19:23.106
But you gotta tell me
what's going on.

824
01:19:24.585 --> 01:19:27.066
What. you were crying for me
all day and now...

825
01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:29.329
now. what?
You-- you won't look at me?

826
01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.379
Have you started
applying for jobs yet?

827
01:19:36.249 --> 01:19:38.469
I mean. that must have
been really embarrassing.

828
01:19:41.385 --> 01:19:42.952
I could write you
a letter of recommendation.

829
01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:44.736
maybe make a couple phone calls.

830
01:19:45.955 --> 01:19:48.609
Hey. just-- just
as long as us hooking up

831
01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.481
doesn't get out. you know?

832
01:19:52.091 --> 01:19:53.179
Okay?

833
01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.225
What?

834
01:19:55.442 --> 01:19:56.792
I thought we had a good time--

835
01:19:58.532 --> 01:20:00.796
I thought we had a good time.

836
01:20:01.013 --> 01:20:03.363
What was good?

837
01:20:03.537 --> 01:20:05.322
-Well. you were great.
-At?

838
01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:09.108
-Getting fucked by me.
-Please let me go.

839
01:20:09.282 --> 01:20:11.328
-Oh. Hera.
-Please. let me go!

840
01:20:11.502 --> 01:20:13.678
Hey. hey. hey. It's okay.

841
01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.993
All right. What-- what is wrong?

842
01:20:24.167 --> 01:20:25.777
You did this to me.

843
01:20:26.386 --> 01:20:29.085
What are you talking about?
You just pushed me off of you.

844
01:20:30.216 --> 01:20:32.436
I didn't want to
and you forced me.

845
01:20:33.132 --> 01:20:34.830
I didn't force you
to do anything.

846
01:20:35.265 --> 01:20:37.702
You ruined everything for me!

847
01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.312
My career!

848
01:20:40.052 --> 01:20:41.358
Can you keep your voice down?

849
01:20:41.532 --> 01:20:42.750
You raped me.

850
01:20:44.448 --> 01:20:45.928
If you say that shit again--

851
01:20:46.102 --> 01:20:48.060
-What. that you raped me?
-You need to back down.

852
01:20:50.062 --> 01:20:52.195
See. this is why
you couldn't handle the job.

853
01:20:52.804 --> 01:20:54.023
or a relationship.

854
01:20:55.241 --> 01:20:56.808
You are fucking crazy.

855
01:20:58.549 --> 01:21:00.116
And now you want people
to feel sorry for you?

856
01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:01.769
Is-- is this a cry for help?

857
01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:07.471
You are just another
dumb fucking slut

858
01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:10.866
trying to whore her way to
the top of the corporate ladder.

859
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:14.826
Oh. Are you gonna cry?

860
01:21:15.827 --> 01:21:19.222
You gonna cry some more? Huh?

861
01:21:19.396 --> 01:21:22.486
You couldn't even take care
of a stupid fucking plant!

862
01:21:23.356 --> 01:21:24.923
You can't keep a plant alive?

863
01:21:25.141 --> 01:21:28.796
What the fuck?

864
01:21:34.498 --> 01:21:37.501
Stop. stop. stop! Stop...

865
01:21:48.425 --> 01:21:49.861
I-- I'm sorry.

866
01:21:51.254 --> 01:21:52.298
Please...

867
01:21:53.604 --> 01:21:54.648
let-- let me go.

868
01:21:58.870 --> 01:22:02.482
I'll get--
I'll get you... a better job.

869
01:22:09.315 --> 01:22:11.491
I am the glass ceiling.

870
01:23:29.874 --> 01:23:31.310
You drew all these for me?

871
01:23:32.268 --> 01:23:34.009
-I felt really bad about--
-It's okay.

872
01:23:35.053 --> 01:23:37.055
You saw something beautiful
and you wanted it.

873
01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:40.189
Next time we'll ask permission.
though. okay?

874
01:23:41.494 --> 01:23:44.410
But no one should ever
hit or touch you.

875
01:23:44.584 --> 01:23:46.021
Okay? And I'm really sorry.

876
01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:48.762
And if anyone does. you tell me.

877
01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:51.330
Okay?

878
01:23:51.504 --> 01:23:52.679
Okay. Aunt Hera.

879
01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.075
These are really good.

880
01:23:59.251 --> 01:24:00.687
You know. I used to draw.

881
01:24:01.558 --> 01:24:03.429
-I might start again.
-You should.

882
01:24:05.692 --> 01:24:07.129
Do you wanna see something nice?

883
01:24:14.658 --> 01:24:15.702
Look at that.

884
01:24:21.186 --> 01:24:22.361
It grew!

885
01:24:25.277 --> 01:24:26.322
