ABOUT JOAN

4
00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:13.000
Directed by Laurent Larivière

5
00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:43.958
My name is Joan. Joan Verra.

6
00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:46.875
It sounds masculine in French.

7
00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:50.292
but it's common in Ireland.
my father's country.

8
00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:53.042
It's spelled J-O-A-N.

9
00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:55.333
But I hate being called Joanne.

10
00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:56.917
It always happens.

11
00:02:57.583 --> 00:03:01.458
Some even pronounce it John.
like John Wayne! Absurd.

12
00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:03.542
It's Joan.

13
00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.208
I was born in the early 60s.

14
00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:12.500
My parents met in Saint-Nazaire.

15
00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.625
My mother was a fairly free young woman.

16
00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:17.542
very much in love.

17
00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:20.917
My father left Ireland at 18

18
00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:23.167
to work in the shipyards.

19
00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:27.125
He met my mother
at the launch of the liner France.

20
00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:30.125
on May 11th. 1960.

21
00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:33.333
I believed there was proof
of that moment.

22
00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:35.083
But there wasn't.

23
00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:38.625
I was even sure I'd held the photo

24
00:03:38.792 --> 00:03:41.042
of them both next to the ship

25
00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:42.875
in the joyful crowd.

26
00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:44.667
It's absurd.

27
00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:47.375
That image was purely in my mind.

28
00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:52.000
I'd heard the story so often.
it had become real.

29
00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:56.833
That's also how memories are made.

30
00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:21.500
What do you want?

31
00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:46.833
That's good.

32
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.167
Two...

33
00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:51.292
Three...

34
00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:52.833
Four...

35
00:23:50.792 --> 00:23:52.458
We've been worried sick!

36
00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:53.958
Don't start.

37
00:23:54.542 --> 00:23:55.833
Come here. my baby.

38
00:24:42.167 --> 00:24:44.500
Nathan is the best thing in my life.

39
00:24:44.958 --> 00:24:47.458
All mothers say that.
but for me it's true.

40
00:24:47.875 --> 00:24:50.625
It isn't true that he saved my life

41
00:24:50.917 --> 00:24:52.833
or gave it meaning.

42
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.750
I don't believe all that nonsense.

43
00:24:56.208 --> 00:24:58.042
We know life has no meaning.

44
00:24:58.542 --> 00:25:00.250
with offspring or without.

45
00:25:01.125 --> 00:25:02.708
Ma'am. your cigarette.

46
00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:04.750
Oh. yes. sorry.

47
00:25:26.792 --> 00:25:28.167
Take him. Dad.

48
00:27:23.833 --> 00:27:25.750
Tim Ardenne speaking.

49
00:27:26.375 --> 00:27:28.167
- It's me.
- Yes?

50
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.750
Who?

51
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.167
You must have the wrong number. madam.

52
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:34.875
Miss.

53
00:27:35.708 --> 00:27:39.083
I'm sorry. miss. I don't have time now.

54
00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.875
My wife has vanished.

55
00:27:41.458 --> 00:27:44.375
I say my wife. but we're not married.

56
00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:46.792
I hate the idea of belonging.

57
00:27:46.958 --> 00:27:48.167
It's just quicker.

58
00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:50.875
Yes. I understand. of course.

59
00:27:51.417 --> 00:27:53.917
She left one night. like that.

60
00:27:54.083 --> 00:27:56.000
Almost without warning.

61
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.250
She just told me. "Don't worry."

62
00:27:59.958 --> 00:28:04.042
Those words are ideal
to make someone worry. aren't they?

63
00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:06.625
It wasn't very wise of her.

64
00:28:09.667 --> 00:28:11.375
I'm sorry. my love.

65
00:28:11.542 --> 00:28:12.500
It's all right.

66
00:28:12.875 --> 00:28:15.500
I can come right away if you want.

67
00:28:15.667 --> 00:28:17.583
No. really. it's ok.

68
00:28:19.375 --> 00:28:21.333
It does me good being here.

69
00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:31.375
One more time.

70
00:28:47.208 --> 00:28:48.917
I need a volunteer.

71
00:28:59.208 --> 00:29:00.500
Your weakness. James?

72
00:29:02.083 --> 00:29:06.125
Off the top of my head. my generosity.
I'm too genuine.

73
00:29:06.417 --> 00:29:07.958
It often deceives me.

74
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.625
He means in this exercise

75
00:29:12.792 --> 00:29:13.958
in particular.

76
00:29:17.167 --> 00:29:18.500
Any ideas?

77
00:29:20.583 --> 00:29:22.083
He neglects his back.

78
00:29:23.583 --> 00:29:24.333
Exactly.

79
00:29:25.417 --> 00:29:28.083
I told him. It's the same at mah-jong.

80
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.333
From the beginning.

81
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:42.292
That man's not very nice.

82
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.333
Why do you say that?

83
00:29:46.083 --> 00:29:48.167
Grandpa's always on the floor.

84
00:29:51.708 --> 00:29:53.875
Grandpa agrees to it.

85
00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:55.208
One more time.

86
00:29:55.375 --> 00:29:57.958
Learn to fall. to pick yourself up.

87
00:29:58.208 --> 00:30:00.000
Talk about a life metaphor.

88
00:30:00.167 --> 00:30:02.542
When you fall.
you hurt yourself. period.

89
00:30:03.833 --> 00:30:05.667
They lie to us. Nathan.

90
00:30:22.417 --> 00:30:24.042
What's she up to?

91
00:30:47.792 --> 00:30:48.833
Nearly ready.

92
00:30:55.833 --> 00:30:57.167
What took so long?

93
00:30:57.833 --> 00:30:59.708
I couldn't find my bag. sorry.

94
00:30:59.875 --> 00:31:01.000
Let's go.

95
00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:42.083
I tried my best to resist.

96
00:32:43.333 --> 00:32:44.958
But it's uncontrollable.

97
00:32:48.792 --> 00:32:50.250
I feel as if

98
00:32:50.583 --> 00:32:51.792
I'm living again.

99
00:32:54.667 --> 00:32:56.583
Not that I felt dead before.

100
00:32:57.583 --> 00:32:59.083
Or sad or anything.

101
00:32:59.917 --> 00:33:01.625
I was already very happy.

102
00:33:02.625 --> 00:33:03.667
But now...

103
00:33:06.917 --> 00:33:08.167
It's much more.

104
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.583
Who knows where it'll lead.

105
00:33:12.917 --> 00:33:14.792
but I have to experience it.

106
00:33:15.333 --> 00:33:17.042
You can't even communicate.

107
00:33:18.042 --> 00:33:19.417
You're wrong.

108
00:33:23.917 --> 00:33:25.667
We communicate perfectly.

109
00:33:26.042 --> 00:33:29.125
Our bodies do the talking.
They speak the truth.

110
00:33:29.292 --> 00:33:31.750
That's a load of crap. Mum.

111
00:33:32.875 --> 00:33:33.792
And Dad?

112
00:33:34.625 --> 00:33:37.708
I love James. I'll always love him.

113
00:33:38.542 --> 00:33:40.000
That's not the issue.

114
00:33:40.792 --> 00:33:42.875
Actually. I think it is.

115
00:33:43.958 --> 00:33:45.250
You must tell him.

116
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.625
No.

117
00:33:47.708 --> 00:33:51.667
You have to tell him.
I refuse to keep it to myself.

118
00:33:51.833 --> 00:33:53.208
You really want that?

119
00:33:53.542 --> 00:33:54.625
I want nothing.

120
00:33:55.875 --> 00:33:57.708
Face your responsibilities.

121
00:34:02.042 --> 00:34:03.792
You have to go now. darling.

122
00:34:26.542 --> 00:34:30.708
I cannot postpone anything.

123
00:34:31.708 --> 00:34:34.583
even if the night weighs like centuries

124
00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.833
on my shoulders.

125
00:34:38.667 --> 00:34:43.833
even if hesitant dawn is late in coming.

126
00:34:44.708 --> 00:34:46.542
I cannot put off my life

127
00:34:46.708 --> 00:34:49.417
to another century.

128
00:34:50.333 --> 00:34:51.833
nor my love.

129
00:34:52.125 --> 00:34:53.958
nor my cry of release.

130
00:34:54.458 --> 00:34:59.208
No. I cannot postpone the heart.

131
00:35:18.917 --> 00:35:20.333
What's going on?

132
00:35:21.333 --> 00:35:23.583
I didn't want it to be like this.

133
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.000
I wanted to drop this off

134
00:35:29.208 --> 00:35:30.500
before coming back.

135
00:35:37.292 --> 00:35:38.542
I'm leaving. James.

136
00:35:38.917 --> 00:35:41.708
To go where? What is this?

137
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.542
I'm leaving. that's it.

138
00:35:46.833 --> 00:35:47.917
That's it?

139
00:35:48.583 --> 00:35:49.833
That's all?

140
00:35:54.292 --> 00:35:56.375
I'm moving to Japan with Kazuo.

141
00:35:56.958 --> 00:35:57.708
Kazuo?

142
00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:01.417
To Japan?

143
00:36:06.083 --> 00:36:07.500
You know I love you.

144
00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:09.167
Yes. I know.

145
00:36:09.708 --> 00:36:10.875
I love you too.

146
00:36:13.125 --> 00:36:14.792
I've nothing against you.

147
00:36:15.625 --> 00:36:16.875
Almost nothing.

148
00:36:20.708 --> 00:36:22.792
I've seen the solicitor.

149
00:36:22.958 --> 00:36:26.000
You get my father's firm.
You'll lack nothing.

150
00:36:29.917 --> 00:36:32.792
I renounce my status
as a mother and wife.

151
00:36:33.875 --> 00:36:36.417
It's too hasty.
You don't know what to expect.

152
00:36:37.167 --> 00:36:39.208
I can't miss out on my life.

153
00:36:46.708 --> 00:36:48.167
You're lucky.

154
00:37:28.292 --> 00:37:29.125
Hello?

155
00:37:29.292 --> 00:37:30.667
Hello. it's me.

156
00:37:30.833 --> 00:37:31.958
Nathan?

157
00:37:32.125 --> 00:37:34.000
It's night there.
aren't you asleep?

158
00:37:34.167 --> 00:37:37.042
No. I'm not. I'm in France.

159
00:37:37.208 --> 00:37:38.375
In Paris?

160
00:37:38.542 --> 00:37:42.083
No. I'm not in Paris.
I took a train to the station in...

161
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.542
What's that little station
10 km from the house?

162
00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:48.583
Why didn't you tell me?

163
00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:50.708
Surprise.

164
00:37:50.875 --> 00:37:52.375
I have to pick you up?

165
00:37:52.542 --> 00:37:55.333
I don't want to bother you.
you're busy...

166
00:37:55.542 --> 00:37:57.333
I can go back to Montreal.

167
00:37:57.542 --> 00:38:00.417
Don't be so touchy.
I'm on my way.

168
00:38:00.583 --> 00:38:01.917
No. I'm kidding.

169
00:38:02.125 --> 00:38:05.125
I hitched.
I'm at Mariposa. at the gate.

170
00:38:26.708 --> 00:38:28.083
My son!

171
00:38:28.417 --> 00:38:29.417
Joan.

172
00:38:30.083 --> 00:38:31.542
You can call me Mum.

173
00:38:31.708 --> 00:38:33.250
You used to hate that.

174
00:38:33.417 --> 00:38:35.750
I was too young to be a mother then.

175
00:38:35.917 --> 00:38:38.042
I need to get back to basics.

176
00:38:38.208 --> 00:38:39.917
Honoured to be part of that.

177
00:38:44.375 --> 00:38:46.083
- What?
- You're very elegant.

178
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.833
- Stop.
- You've changed. Your walk...

179
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.875
You're more self-confident.

180
00:38:51.458 --> 00:38:52.625
It's the snow.

181
00:38:52.792 --> 00:38:55.583
It's down to snowshoes.
not confidence.

182
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.750
How can you stand the snow?

183
00:38:57.958 --> 00:39:00.958
It hit -27° C in Montreal last winter.

184
00:39:01.125 --> 00:39:02.708
I don't think I could.

185
00:39:03.167 --> 00:39:05.250
You must come to see us one day.

186
00:39:06.292 --> 00:39:07.750
Why are you here?

187
00:39:10.042 --> 00:39:11.792
Did Tim ask you to come?

188
00:39:11.958 --> 00:39:13.250
You know he didn't.

189
00:39:16.083 --> 00:39:18.208
Is the small bedroom ok?

190
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.667
Your childhood room. I mean.

191
00:39:20.833 --> 00:39:22.417
There's a big bed now.

192
00:39:22.625 --> 00:39:23.833
Anything suits me.

193
00:39:24.417 --> 00:39:26.083
It'll bring back memories.

194
00:39:32.958 --> 00:39:34.000
It's locked.

195
00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:37.375
The handle turns the other way around.
remember.

196
00:39:43.667 --> 00:39:44.917
Drat...

197
00:39:46.042 --> 00:39:48.375
Silly me. the key's in the vase.

198
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.167
I don't know where it is.

199
00:39:58.083 --> 00:39:59.708
Never mind. Who cares?

200
00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:03.083
The guest room suits me fine. ok.

201
00:40:33.667 --> 00:40:36.250
That unsettled me a lot as a kid.

202
00:40:36.417 --> 00:40:38.208
True. it is a bit raunchy.

203
00:40:53.958 --> 00:40:56.250
I'd forgotten how beautiful it is.

204
00:40:56.917 --> 00:40:59.375
I feel I haven't been here in ages.

205
00:40:59.625 --> 00:41:01.250
I can confirm that.

206
00:41:02.292 --> 00:41:04.417
Sorry I missed your retirement party.

207
00:41:04.583 --> 00:41:07.750
It's better this way.
I'd rather see you alone.

208
00:41:08.375 --> 00:41:10.042
Me too. It's been ages?

209
00:41:10.375 --> 00:41:11.417
Yes.

210
00:41:12.167 --> 00:41:13.333
I hesitated.

211
00:41:13.875 --> 00:41:16.250
Should I come or not?

212
00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:18.375
It's good you're here.

213
00:41:19.792 --> 00:41:21.375
It was a horrible party.

214
00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:23.000
I hated it.

215
00:41:23.625 --> 00:41:26.208
Solemn farewells. forced compliments...

216
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:27.917
What a drag.

217
00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:31.292
All I miss are the manuscripts.

218
00:41:31.792 --> 00:41:34.375
They send me a few now and then.

219
00:41:34.917 --> 00:41:36.625
There's good stuff this year.

220
00:41:38.458 --> 00:41:41.292
I forgot.
you only read scientific texts.

221
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:42.708
No.

222
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.500
On the plane. I read a book of Tim's
I had lying around.

223
00:41:46.833 --> 00:41:49.208
Tim Ardenne's books don't lie around.

224
00:41:49.375 --> 00:41:50.083
Which one?

225
00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:54.125
A book about trains
and wrong directions...

226
00:41:54.542 --> 00:41:56.125
Steel and Sweat.

227
00:41:56.292 --> 00:41:58.167
- Did you like it?
- Yes.

228
00:41:58.542 --> 00:42:02.708
I really liked his description
of the female character.

229
00:42:04.708 --> 00:42:05.583
Is it you?

230
00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:08.458
He claims it is.

231
00:42:08.625 --> 00:42:10.542
But you know him.

232
00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:13.833
Has he always loved you?

233
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.542
Yes.

234
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.958
"As he walked.

235
00:42:18.125 --> 00:42:21.250
"her bright face
was continually before him.

236
00:42:21.667 --> 00:42:24.625
"It was madness to think of such purity.

237
00:42:24.917 --> 00:42:26.708
"He had known vice and kindness.

238
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.542
"but never purity."

239
00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:31.917
Purity... That's me to a T.

240
00:43:12.125 --> 00:43:12.917
Careful!

241
00:43:36.958 --> 00:43:38.375
"Die...

242
00:43:38.667 --> 00:43:40.625
"That's what you have to do.

243
00:43:41.792 --> 00:43:43.708
"That is the only way

244
00:43:43.875 --> 00:43:46.875
"to truly gain access to life.

245
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.542
"One does not live

246
00:43:49.958 --> 00:43:52.958
"if one is not prepared to die.

247
00:43:53.917 --> 00:43:56.125
"Missing your own death

248
00:43:56.458 --> 00:43:59.292
"would be worse than anything else."

249
00:44:02.792 --> 00:44:04.083
Mr Ardenne?

250
00:44:07.375 --> 00:44:08.083
Tim?

251
00:44:10.083 --> 00:44:10.917
Yes?

252
00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.458
Dying as the only way

253
00:44:13.625 --> 00:44:15.875
to truly gain access to life.

254
00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:19.458
That's quite contradictory.

255
00:44:19.625 --> 00:44:20.625
Yes.

256
00:44:24.417 --> 00:44:25.875
You think so?

257
00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:28.792
I guess it is.

258
00:44:38.125 --> 00:44:40.250
If it requires explanation...

259
00:44:47.875 --> 00:44:49.583
It's all in here.

260
00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.542
The last part of the book is very funny.

261
00:44:57.167 --> 00:44:58.833
The surprising thing

262
00:44:59.708 --> 00:45:04.042
is that people in France
laugh as much as they do in Germany.

263
00:45:04.333 --> 00:45:06.833
Could you define comedy for us?

264
00:45:07.417 --> 00:45:08.958
Absolutely not.

265
00:45:10.958 --> 00:45:13.667
But you agree the ending is funny?

266
00:45:19.667 --> 00:45:21.958
I can't stop people from laughing.

267
00:45:23.375 --> 00:45:25.750
What makes a good book for you?

268
00:45:26.167 --> 00:45:27.375
Alcohol.

269
00:45:28.417 --> 00:45:31.333
Is your success based
on a misunderstanding?

270
00:45:33.208 --> 00:45:36.750
I don't think we're loved or hated
for the right reasons.

271
00:45:39.667 --> 00:45:40.625
Ever.

272
00:45:49.333 --> 00:45:51.333
You first write in French.

273
00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.000
then again in German.

274
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.208
Isn't that a little strange?

275
00:45:58.292 --> 00:46:00.500
I'd rather end the interview.

276
00:46:01.958 --> 00:46:03.792
I'm suffering too much.

277
00:46:04.958 --> 00:46:06.375
Why are you suffering?

278
00:46:11.833 --> 00:46:13.833
I'm in love. you understand?

279
00:46:14.292 --> 00:46:16.167
That's wonderful!

280
00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:20.167
I love Joan Verra.

281
00:46:23.542 --> 00:46:25.292
Your French publisher?

282
00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.083
She discovered me.

283
00:46:28.542 --> 00:46:29.792
Fantastic.

284
00:46:30.583 --> 00:46:32.000
She doesn't love me.

285
00:46:33.042 --> 00:46:35.250
I'm sure she likes you.

286
00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:40.333
The title. The Misery of Beautiful Days.
where is it from?

287
00:46:41.917 --> 00:46:43.750
She doesn't love me.

288
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:46.792
She likes me.

289
00:46:47.667 --> 00:46:49.250
She often says so.

290
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.125
That's something. I suppose.

291
00:46:55.083 --> 00:46:57.583
She can even say. "I like you a lot."

292
00:47:00.042 --> 00:47:01.958
And that's really...

293
00:47:03.917 --> 00:47:06.125
That's really unbearable.

294
00:47:11.125 --> 00:47:12.167
Let's stop.

295
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.208
It's for the best.

296
00:47:14.375 --> 00:47:16.125
I'll see you again soon.

297
00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:19.417
Off line. thank you.

298
00:47:29.333 --> 00:47:30.583
Why are you here?

299
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:32.167
I had some free time.

300
00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:35.125
Rubbish. you can't skip school.

301
00:47:35.667 --> 00:47:37.458
Go back to Paris. I'm busy.

302
00:47:37.625 --> 00:47:40.542
He takes up all my energy.
I'm working.

303
00:47:41.083 --> 00:47:43.250
It's ok. I know you're working.

304
00:47:43.417 --> 00:47:46.208
I'm not a child. I can manage on my own.

305
00:47:46.417 --> 00:47:47.583
How was I?

306
00:47:48.167 --> 00:47:49.458
Devastating.

307
00:47:50.333 --> 00:47:53.083
I could've shed real tears. you know.

308
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.583
It would've been no use.

309
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:58.167
You have no emotions.

310
00:47:58.333 --> 00:48:01.250
I have emotions.
but different from yours.

311
00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:04.750
Forgive me.

312
00:48:20.208 --> 00:48:23.083
- What paid for your ticket?
- Your jewels.

313
00:48:23.417 --> 00:48:24.500
Stupid.

314
00:48:27.542 --> 00:48:29.458
What's wrong now?

315
00:48:29.958 --> 00:48:31.500
I won't sign this crap.

316
00:48:31.792 --> 00:48:33.250
It's your first novel.

317
00:48:33.417 --> 00:48:34.917
It was a rough draft.

318
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.042
The book is important for me.

319
00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:42.042
It changed my life. Literally.

320
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.208
It's a masterpiece.

321
00:48:44.375 --> 00:48:45.375
A masterpiece?

322
00:48:45.542 --> 00:48:46.750
Nathan. please.

323
00:48:46.917 --> 00:48:49.875
I felt brought back to life.
thanks to this book.

324
00:48:50.042 --> 00:48:52.208
I rediscovered my vitality.

325
00:48:52.625 --> 00:48:56.875
Through the life of a garbageman
crushed to death by his truck?

326
00:48:57.292 --> 00:48:58.542
She seems moved.

327
00:49:00.375 --> 00:49:01.875
Good for her.

328
00:49:02.333 --> 00:49:03.917
And I have no emotions?

329
00:49:05.125 --> 00:49:07.042
You're all pissing me off!

330
00:49:15.833 --> 00:49:18.625
I can sign it if you like.

331
00:49:19.042 --> 00:49:21.792
I can imitate his signature perfectly.

332
00:49:32.625 --> 00:49:33.792
Are you ok?

333
00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:38.583
It's here.

334
00:49:39.417 --> 00:49:41.333
I feel it seeping in.

335
00:49:42.458 --> 00:49:45.083
It's harder and harder.

336
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.375
Each time. it's harder.

337
00:49:47.667 --> 00:49:48.500
What is?

338
00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:49.792
Dying.

339
00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.042
Haven't you ever died?

340
00:49:52.583 --> 00:49:53.625
Never.

341
00:49:54.542 --> 00:49:56.708
I knew it. You can't understand.

342
00:49:56.875 --> 00:49:58.125
Give me your hand.

343
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:01.083
Things end.

344
00:50:01.958 --> 00:50:05.083
That's how it is. They end.
You must accept it.

345
00:50:05.792 --> 00:50:08.250
You have to be strong.
Promise me?

346
00:50:08.417 --> 00:50:09.792
I promise.

347
00:50:11.125 --> 00:50:12.667
Beyond the grave.

348
00:50:12.958 --> 00:50:14.542
I'll still love you.

349
00:50:19.167 --> 00:50:20.583
He's a handful.

350
00:50:21.208 --> 00:50:22.875
It'd be no fun if he wasn't.

351
00:50:23.042 --> 00:50:24.250
Can you stand him?

352
00:50:24.417 --> 00:50:27.083
I actually find him touching in a way.

353
00:50:34.333 --> 00:50:36.875
You're like the moon and I'm the sun.

354
00:50:37.208 --> 00:50:38.250
Touching?

355
00:50:39.708 --> 00:50:41.167
He has his qualities.

356
00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:45.917
Come on!

357
00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:54.417
Move it!

358
00:50:56.917 --> 00:50:59.000
Don't you want to call a taxi?

359
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.125
No use. we're only five minutes away.

360
00:51:02.625 --> 00:51:05.292
I'm in pain and I'm tired.

361
00:51:09.417 --> 00:51:10.500
Joan!

362
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:24.708
Joan...

363
00:51:26.292 --> 00:51:28.042
I owe you an apology.

364
00:51:28.208 --> 00:51:29.333
That's true.

365
00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:31.750
For my behaviour. not for my love.

366
00:51:31.917 --> 00:51:33.458
- Tim...
- Let me speak.

367
00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:38.083
It won't take long
and I'll only say it once.

368
00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.542
I won't repeat this.
After.

369
00:51:40.833 --> 00:51:42.458
I'll leave you in peace.

370
00:51:49.583 --> 00:51:51.792
Living without you is unbearable.

371
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:55.667
Yet I try to break away from you.
I really try.

372
00:51:56.417 --> 00:51:57.542
But I can't.

373
00:51:59.292 --> 00:52:02.583
I've always tried
to be independent of women.

374
00:52:03.042 --> 00:52:05.375
to limit their power over me.

375
00:52:06.167 --> 00:52:08.417
I felt in control of my feelings.

376
00:52:09.792 --> 00:52:10.875
But then...

377
00:52:12.417 --> 00:52:16.542
you arrived in my life
and I realized nothing I had lived...

378
00:52:18.833 --> 00:52:19.833
nothing...

379
00:52:20.417 --> 00:52:22.583
had any real value.

380
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:28.417
All that mattered
was being by your side.

381
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.333
Or not too far away.

382
00:52:30.625 --> 00:52:32.458
Like these last few years.

383
00:52:35.417 --> 00:52:38.083
I also know that I'm unbearable.

384
00:52:38.583 --> 00:52:41.458
I understand
that you feel like slapping me.

385
00:52:44.708 --> 00:52:45.792
Go ahead.

386
00:53:41.917 --> 00:53:44.208
What are you doing in Cologne?

387
00:53:44.792 --> 00:53:46.917
Three days apart was too much?

388
00:53:47.083 --> 00:53:48.458
I can't believe that.

389
00:53:54.417 --> 00:53:55.833
You searched my office?

390
00:53:58.083 --> 00:53:59.542
You read my notebooks?

391
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:02.625
Of course you did.

392
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.167
I never would have.

393
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.583
Did you enjoy it?

394
00:54:06.917 --> 00:54:08.542
Yes. I enjoyed it.

395
00:54:09.708 --> 00:54:11.083
Did you learn anything?

396
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:12.208
You bet.

397
00:54:12.583 --> 00:54:13.708
Such as what?

398
00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:15.542
About you and Doug.

399
00:54:16.458 --> 00:54:17.625
You won't say Dad?

400
00:54:17.875 --> 00:54:19.208
Why would I?

401
00:54:20.125 --> 00:54:22.083
I don't know what you learned.

402
00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:25.833
I never lied to you. I told you...

403
00:54:26.875 --> 00:54:27.667
everything.

404
00:54:27.833 --> 00:54:28.792
In general.

405
00:54:28.958 --> 00:54:30.625
Now I know the details.

406
00:54:30.875 --> 00:54:32.667
The magic of a first love.

407
00:54:32.958 --> 00:54:34.625
Irony doesn't suit you.

408
00:54:35.167 --> 00:54:36.333
You're hurt.

409
00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.458
There's stuff on me
I don't like.

410
00:54:41.292 --> 00:54:42.625
I'm listening.

411
00:54:51.917 --> 00:54:53.167
"Friday. July 10th.

412
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:57.167
"I fear Nathan may turn superficial.
focused on his appearance."

413
00:54:57.333 --> 00:54:58.083
Nice.

414
00:54:59.125 --> 00:55:01.417
"Each hair he counts on his chest

415
00:55:01.583 --> 00:55:03.125
"is a personal victory."

416
00:55:03.292 --> 00:55:05.625
I never did that. It's humiliating.

417
00:55:06.125 --> 00:55:07.417
So don't read it.

418
00:55:07.583 --> 00:55:09.667
This is less well written. I feel.

419
00:55:09.833 --> 00:55:11.125
You're the expert.

420
00:55:11.375 --> 00:55:12.625
Don't be mean.

421
00:55:13.167 --> 00:55:14.292
I'm not.

422
00:55:17.208 --> 00:55:19.000
- Please...
- Hold on.

423
00:55:19.917 --> 00:55:20.625
Enough.

424
00:55:20.792 --> 00:55:24.208
If you came about your puberty.
I don't have time.

425
00:55:24.375 --> 00:55:26.625
I came cos you fell asleep one day.

426
00:55:26.792 --> 00:55:28.958
One summer. In August.

427
00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:31.542
Where is it?

428
00:57:31.125 --> 00:57:32.250
You fell asleep.

429
00:57:32.792 --> 00:57:33.833
Why?

430
00:57:34.708 --> 00:57:36.000
Out of carelessness?

431
00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:38.875
I forbid you to say that.

432
00:57:40.917 --> 00:57:42.167
You forbid me?

433
00:58:23.417 --> 00:58:24.833
Can I have a drag?

434
00:58:25.625 --> 00:58:27.250
- You smoke?
- No.

435
00:58:44.167 --> 00:58:45.750
How long did it last?

436
00:58:45.958 --> 00:58:47.042
I don't know.

437
00:58:48.042 --> 00:58:51.333
How long was I unconscious?
Ten minutes? Fifteen?

438
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:52.833
I've no idea.

439
00:58:53.417 --> 00:58:55.500
I remember it seemed endless.

440
00:58:56.167 --> 00:58:58.333
Without the fire brigade...

441
00:58:59.958 --> 00:59:01.792
You weren't going to tell me?

442
00:59:03.958 --> 00:59:05.000
No.

443
00:59:05.792 --> 00:59:08.500
You're well. in shape.
Nothing else matters.

444
00:59:10.625 --> 00:59:13.875
You can't even remember it.
What are you after?

445
00:59:15.333 --> 00:59:17.417
You need reassuring. is that it?

446
00:59:18.083 --> 00:59:19.083
Yes.

447
00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:23.917
Doubt my love and I'll kill you.

448
00:59:32.167 --> 00:59:34.792
Same again. please. Vodka tonic.

449
00:59:40.333 --> 00:59:42.333
It burns? That's good.

450
00:59:42.792 --> 00:59:44.583
It explodes in your head.

451
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:45.833
Perfect.

452
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.750
You've drunk before. right?

453
00:59:50.583 --> 00:59:51.917
It's the first time?

454
00:59:53.625 --> 00:59:55.542
You've always been a bit behind.

455
00:59:59.833 --> 01:00:04.042
Nathan. you're a young man now.
You'll be a real man soon.

456
01:00:04.208 --> 01:00:05.833
I won't talk sex with you.

457
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.958
No.

458
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:08.417
Listen to me.

459
01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:11.333
Your schooling in the next five years

460
01:00:11.667 --> 01:00:13.625
will determine your future.

461
01:00:14.167 --> 01:00:16.875
Do your learning now while you can.

462
01:00:17.042 --> 01:00:18.792
In five years. it'll be too late.

463
01:00:19.708 --> 01:00:22.750
Knowing you.
you'll realize and find it unbearable.

464
01:00:23.167 --> 01:00:25.792
I won't be able to help. obviously.

465
01:00:25.958 --> 01:00:27.083
Obviously.

466
01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:32.958
You'll have to face problems alone.

467
01:00:33.667 --> 01:00:36.917
I'll be there if you need me.
but that won't help.

468
01:00:40.042 --> 01:00:42.083
We have to face things alone.

469
01:00:48.042 --> 01:00:50.125
But you know that. right?

470
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:52.958
No.

471
01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:09.542
Come on.

472
01:01:15.667 --> 01:01:18.083
Others' looks shouldn't matter.

473
01:01:19.292 --> 01:01:20.917
It's about your life.

474
01:01:29.042 --> 01:01:30.208
Stop it.

475
01:03:10.875 --> 01:03:12.000
Nathan?

476
01:03:14.417 --> 01:03:16.125
Nathan. are you awake?

477
01:03:17.375 --> 01:03:20.208
If you have a long nap now.
you'll be a mess.

478
01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:22.167
You won't sleep tonight.

479
01:03:24.792 --> 01:03:25.958
Nathan?

480
01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:28.292
Can you hear me?

481
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:04.458
Yes?

482
01:05:08.292 --> 01:05:09.500
We had an appointment?

483
01:05:09.917 --> 01:05:11.958
Do I need one to see my mother?

484
01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:15.208
Of course not.
Sorry. My head's stuffed with work!

485
01:05:15.458 --> 01:05:16.875
I'll come back later.

486
01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:19.792
Champagne? Why?

487
01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.208
I forgot your birthday again?

488
01:05:23.375 --> 01:05:24.292
No.

489
01:05:24.542 --> 01:05:25.792
I had an interview.

490
01:05:25.958 --> 01:05:27.500
For a lab?
You never said.

491
01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:29.583
I wanted to be sure.

492
01:05:29.917 --> 01:05:32.417
So guess who they chose.

493
01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:35.417
Your son.

494
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:37.833
Wonderful! I'm proud of you.

495
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.708
Now I'll have access to real resources.

496
01:05:40.875 --> 01:05:42.625
unlike what I have now.

497
01:05:42.833 --> 01:05:45.042
and with a totally free rein.

498
01:05:46.083 --> 01:05:48.042
And I'll be heading a team.

499
01:05:48.208 --> 01:05:49.542
My dream come true.

500
01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:52.750
I have to admit.
it's scary to think about.

501
01:05:52.917 --> 01:05:54.292
so I try not to.

502
01:05:55.458 --> 01:05:56.958
You'll do brilliantly.

503
01:05:57.125 --> 01:05:59.333
It's a real dream. The building

504
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.375
is modern. centralized.

505
01:06:01.542 --> 01:06:03.458
It's state-of-the-art over there.

506
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:07.250
Over there?

507
01:06:09.792 --> 01:06:10.958
It's in Montreal.

508
01:06:26.625 --> 01:06:27.333
Joan?

509
01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:30.042
If you're happy...

510
01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.417
It's good.

511
01:06:37.167 --> 01:06:38.542
I need a cigarette.

512
01:06:39.042 --> 01:06:40.125
You have one.

513
01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:43.042
I need another.

514
01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.000
You don't seem pleased.

515
01:06:49.625 --> 01:06:51.875
I am. I'm very happy for you.

516
01:06:52.167 --> 01:06:53.625
But seeing you leave...

517
01:06:55.167 --> 01:06:57.167
Children leave their parents.

518
01:06:58.083 --> 01:06:59.458
Sooner or later.

519
01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:02.792
I'm 30. after all.

520
01:07:04.125 --> 01:07:04.917
So?

521
01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:13.792
Forgive me. I'm being stupid.

522
01:07:16.667 --> 01:07:18.167
I'll come back often.

523
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:21.583
You can visit too.
You don't know Quebec.

524
01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:23.625
It's really nice.

525
01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:28.625
Want that champagne?

526
01:07:29.833 --> 01:07:31.375
I'll get the glasses.

527
01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:53.625
Where were you?

528
01:07:53.792 --> 01:07:55.708
An errand in the village.

529
01:07:55.875 --> 01:07:57.583
- On foot?
- Yes.

530
01:07:57.875 --> 01:07:59.250
Whatever for?

531
01:07:59.417 --> 01:08:00.958
"Did you rest. dear?"

532
01:08:01.833 --> 01:08:03.208
"Yes. thank you."

533
01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:06.125
"Your jet lag from the flight
to see your mum?"

534
01:08:06.417 --> 01:08:07.833
"I'll get over it soon."

535
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.458
"Will it be sunny?"

536
01:08:09.625 --> 01:08:11.417
I hate when you do that!

537
01:08:11.625 --> 01:08:13.292
I was worried sick.

538
01:08:13.458 --> 01:08:14.875
Why. exactly?

539
01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.667
I'm a big boy now.

540
01:08:17.958 --> 01:08:19.458
Why leave me alone?

541
01:08:19.625 --> 01:08:21.583
I couldn't sleep.

542
01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.167
you weren't around
and I needed a walk.

543
01:08:24.333 --> 01:08:25.583
I was here.

544
01:08:25.917 --> 01:08:28.042
You can't vanish like that.

545
01:08:29.083 --> 01:08:30.292
I didn't vanish.

546
01:08:30.625 --> 01:08:32.250
Mum. calm down.

547
01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:34.250
No. I don't want to!

548
01:08:41.833 --> 01:08:44.042
Find something to do. I'll tidy up.

549
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:49.708
If you came to mess me about.

550
01:08:49.958 --> 01:08:52.000
pack up and go back to Montreal.

551
01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:54.250
Drop it.

552
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.208
Still like doughnut peaches?

553
01:08:58.375 --> 01:08:59.292
Yes.

554
01:08:59.708 --> 01:09:02.042
I got some for you.
Was it a good idea?

555
01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:04.000
I wonder.

556
01:10:02.542 --> 01:10:04.750
"He had finally met her.

557
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
"The woman.

558
01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:09.417
"the one he had waited for
without realizing it.

559
01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:11.417
"the one destined for him.

560
01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:13.542
"He had looked into her soul

561
01:10:13.708 --> 01:10:17.125
"and had grasped
her rare special something.

562
01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:20.458
"as beautiful as the eyes reflecting it.

563
01:10:20.708 --> 01:10:23.417
"as beautiful as the flesh embodying it.

564
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.292
"Not one word. not one sign.

565
01:10:26.583 --> 01:10:30.542
"not one word of advice from the Divine
had guided him.

566
01:10:30.792 --> 01:10:32.875
"He didn't believe in the Divine.

567
01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:35.417
"There was no beyond.

568
01:10:35.583 --> 01:10:37.417
"He was sure of it.

569
01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:39.542
"Life had to be lived.

570
01:10:39.958 --> 01:10:43.583
"here and now.
before sinking into the void."

571
01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:46.958
It's magnificent.

572
01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.750
You can't deny it.

573
01:10:48.917 --> 01:10:50.750
It's great. easy to read.

574
01:10:51.917 --> 01:10:53.125
Very pleasant.

575
01:10:56.250 --> 01:10:57.375
Pleasant?

576
01:10:57.958 --> 01:11:00.500
- Is that an insult?
- Not at all.

577
01:11:00.792 --> 01:11:03.083
You certainly don't disappoint us.

578
01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:06.583
Really.
it's exactly what we expect of you.

579
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:08.875
You must be very pleased.

580
01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:13.250
You insult me so naturally.

581
01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:15.875
I was bored stiff!
It's the same recipe.

582
01:11:16.042 --> 01:11:18.000
I've read it ten times before.

583
01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:20.208
I may be wrong. but this line...

584
01:11:23.625 --> 01:11:25.667
"There was no beyond.
He was sure of it.

585
01:11:25.833 --> 01:11:28.417
"Life had to be lived. here and now.
before sinking into the void."

586
01:11:28.583 --> 01:11:30.667
Wasn't that in your last novel?

587
01:11:30.833 --> 01:11:32.500
And the one before too?

588
01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:37.000
I assert a right to repetition.

589
01:11:37.167 --> 01:11:40.667
People will end up realizing
I've only written one book

590
01:11:40.833 --> 01:11:43.083
that took on different forms.

591
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:45.750
All great artists dig a furrow.

592
01:11:45.917 --> 01:11:47.333
More like a tunnel.

593
01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:50.375
The train driver
blending with his engine.

594
01:11:50.542 --> 01:11:51.958
you call that new?

595
01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:54.792
He doesn't die.
crushed by the machine.

596
01:11:56.708 --> 01:11:57.792
I guess...

597
01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.708
Show me your breasts?

598
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.583
No.

599
01:12:03.958 --> 01:12:04.958
You hesitated.

600
01:12:05.417 --> 01:12:08.375
Of course. you turn me on
and that annoys me.

601
01:12:09.042 --> 01:12:10.542
But I know your game.

602
01:12:10.708 --> 01:12:12.458
Sex as a diversionary tactic

603
01:12:12.792 --> 01:12:13.833
is pathetic.

604
01:12:15.208 --> 01:12:18.000
The first part.
the kid watching trains.

605
01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:18.917
who cares?

606
01:12:19.083 --> 01:12:20.708
We want to be on the tracks.

607
01:12:20.875 --> 01:12:22.375
We want movement!

608
01:12:27.917 --> 01:12:30.417
And the affair with his boss' wife...

609
01:12:30.583 --> 01:12:32.292
Talk about tasteless!

610
01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:38.250
It compromises the ending.

611
01:12:41.375 --> 01:12:42.583
We need a rewrite.

612
01:12:47.292 --> 01:12:48.167
Hello?

613
01:12:51.417 --> 01:12:53.875
It's the Saint-Nazaire housing office.

614
01:12:54.042 --> 01:12:58.750
I'm calling about overdue rent
on apartment B14 at Ambroise Paré.

615
01:12:59.958 --> 01:13:03.292
There must be some mistake.
I don't understand.

616
01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:06.125
You are Madeleine Verra's daughter?

617
01:13:06.542 --> 01:13:08.292
It must be a homonym.

618
01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:11.500
My mother moved to Japan
over twenty years ago.

619
01:13:11.667 --> 01:13:14.208
She was Madeleine Joséphine Verra.

620
01:13:14.667 --> 01:13:17.125
née Saulet on October 14. 1942.

621
01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.500
in Saint-Nazaire

622
01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.667
who died last week?

623
01:13:26.208 --> 01:13:27.208
Hello?

624
01:13:29.042 --> 01:13:30.208
Yes...

625
01:13:31.708 --> 01:13:36.042
You need to clear the apartment.
There's a waiting list. Sorry.

626
01:13:37.417 --> 01:13:39.292
Yes. all right.

627
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.875
We get a lot of deaths here.

628
01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:50.583
But hers really wasn't fair.

629
01:13:51.792 --> 01:13:54.333
People liked her.
She helped out a lot.

630
01:13:54.958 --> 01:13:56.792
They'd leave her their kids.

631
01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:59.417
She'd babysit for a bit of money.

632
01:13:59.583 --> 01:14:00.833
She needed it.

633
01:14:02.375 --> 01:14:05.250
I never saw anyone so good with kids.

634
01:14:05.583 --> 01:14:06.958
What a joke...

635
01:14:10.458 --> 01:14:14.083
We invited her once for Christmas.
Something simple.

636
01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.167
She refused.

637
01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:17.792
That wasn't nice.
We did it for her sake.

638
01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:19.875
You accept an invitation.

639
01:14:20.042 --> 01:14:22.208
We'll bring them back later.

640
01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:24.250
It's the last door.

641
01:16:18.292 --> 01:16:19.458
I'm here.

642
01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:54.333
What the hell was she doing here?

643
01:16:54.875 --> 01:16:56.542
What is this shit?

644
01:16:56.958 --> 01:16:58.417
When did she come back?

645
01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:01.000
These are her rent receipts.

646
01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:06.250
The oldest one is from November 1989.

647
01:17:06.958 --> 01:17:08.875
That's over fifteen years ago.

648
01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:12.750
How come she never told us?

649
01:17:15.667 --> 01:17:17.750
What did we do to deserve this?

650
01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:20.500
It's sick. I was alone with Nathan.

651
01:17:21.708 --> 01:17:23.125
It's really sick.

652
01:17:23.542 --> 01:17:24.750
Don't say that.

653
01:17:26.917 --> 01:17:28.583
Who knows what happened.

654
01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:31.875
Nothing. apparently.

655
01:17:41.625 --> 01:17:43.708
She'd planned her own funeral.

656
01:17:43.875 --> 01:17:45.042
A long time ago.

657
01:17:45.792 --> 01:17:47.708
On arriving back here.

658
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.708
She even deprived us of her death.

659
01:17:53.417 --> 01:17:55.167
Her ashes were scattered

660
01:17:55.333 --> 01:17:56.875
in the local cemetery.

661
01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:01.958
There's a sealed envelope.

662
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:25.792
Excuse me.
the garden of remembrance. please?

663
01:18:25.958 --> 01:18:29.292
Over there.
The memorial area is being remodelled.

664
01:18:31.167 --> 01:18:32.292
Thank you.

665
01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:34.625
Memorial area...

666
01:19:02.417 --> 01:19:04.458
"Joan. my darling little girl.

667
01:19:04.625 --> 01:19:07.042
"Don't seek an explanation
in these words.

668
01:19:07.208 --> 01:19:08.750
"Life is elusive.

669
01:19:08.917 --> 01:19:11.542
"I have no answers. I regret nothing.

670
01:19:11.833 --> 01:19:14.708
"Leaving for Japan
was a wonderful adventure.

671
01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.167
"You've no idea how...

672
01:19:18.667 --> 01:19:19.583
"how...

673
01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:21.458
"happy I was there.

674
01:19:21.625 --> 01:19:24.833
"I found my place and culture.
It's so beautiful.

675
01:19:25.083 --> 01:19:27.667
"Cherry blossom season is magical.

676
01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:30.958
"Kazuo and I opened
a small bonsai tree shop.

677
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:35.125
"I became a specialist.
almost a celebrity.

678
01:19:35.292 --> 01:19:37.458
"Just think. a European

679
01:19:37.625 --> 01:19:40.417
"outdoing the Japanese
in their ancient art.

680
01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:43.042
"They'd cross the country to see me.

681
01:19:43.417 --> 01:19:45.542
"But Kazuo piled up gambling debts.

682
01:19:45.708 --> 01:19:47.625
"He owed money to Yakuza.

683
01:19:47.833 --> 01:19:50.917
"As he couldn't pay.
he became their henchman.

684
01:19:51.083 --> 01:19:52.667
"But he kept gambling.

685
01:19:52.917 --> 01:19:55.792
"I found all that out
when we had to flee.

686
01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:58.375
"We moved to South Korea.

687
01:19:58.542 --> 01:20:01.042
"We lived humbly. but we were in love.

688
01:20:01.208 --> 01:20:02.417
"That was the main thing."

689
01:20:02.583 --> 01:20:04.208
Even in death. she lies.

690
01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:08.667
"I'm lying. of course.
I lie in writing this.

691
01:20:08.833 --> 01:20:11.542
"Should I say that I made a mistake.

692
01:20:11.708 --> 01:20:14.500
"that Kazuo was always a total asshole.

693
01:20:14.667 --> 01:20:17.333
"and that I lived in solitude and shame?

694
01:20:17.583 --> 01:20:20.250
"Frankly. which version do you prefer?

695
01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:25.583
"I never stopped thinking of you all.

696
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.083
"refusing to admit my weakness
and my failure.

697
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:31.375
"Make your life magical.

698
01:20:33.542 --> 01:20:35.167
"my darling little girl.

699
01:20:36.042 --> 01:20:37.958
"I've been happy. you know.

700
01:20:40.875 --> 01:20:44.000
"Remember that. I loved living."

701
01:21:13.458 --> 01:21:15.125
"I would like the dead

702
01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:16.667
"to stay dead.

703
01:21:17.458 --> 01:21:20.333
"Why should they rule over me?

704
01:21:21.125 --> 01:21:23.042
"Beauty is alive

705
01:21:23.542 --> 01:21:25.042
"and it is eternal."

706
01:21:31.333 --> 01:21:34.875
"Beauty is alive and it is eternal."

707
01:21:37.417 --> 01:21:38.625
You believe that?

708
01:21:39.708 --> 01:21:40.625
No.

709
01:21:42.417 --> 01:21:43.458
All the same...

710
01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:48.958
What do we drink to?

711
01:21:50.667 --> 01:21:53.208
We drink to my mother. I suppose.

712
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:56.042
And to Japan.

713
01:21:57.750 --> 01:22:01.333
We should have brought sake
to drink on her grave.

714
01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:03.708
That would have had style.

715
01:22:17.208 --> 01:22:18.792
We did a new experiment.

716
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.542
We managed to erase a memory
in a brain.

717
01:22:22.917 --> 01:22:23.833
No!

718
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.583
A mouse's brain.

719
01:22:26.958 --> 01:22:28.167
Can mice swim?

720
01:22:28.333 --> 01:22:29.583
Yes. very well.

721
01:22:30.292 --> 01:22:31.750
But that's not the issue.

722
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.583
We put a plastic platform in the pool.

723
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.750
the same colour as the liquid.

724
01:22:37.917 --> 01:22:39.042
Very hard to see.

725
01:22:39.208 --> 01:22:42.125
The mouse has to find it to rest on it.

726
01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.208
It's the only solution.

727
01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.667
It takes time. but she finds it.

728
01:22:47.125 --> 01:22:49.083
- Poor thing.
- What?

729
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:50.833
You hate mice.

730
01:22:52.125 --> 01:22:53.000
The next day.

731
01:22:53.167 --> 01:22:55.583
we do it again
with the same mouse

732
01:22:56.167 --> 01:22:57.667
who remembers everything.

733
01:22:57.833 --> 01:23:00.417
She swims straight to the platform

734
01:23:00.583 --> 01:23:01.583
without hesitation.

735
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:03.208
She knows where it is.

736
01:23:03.542 --> 01:23:04.708
She has learned.

737
01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:06.083
Fascinating.

738
01:23:06.375 --> 01:23:08.667
Day three. we start again.

739
01:23:09.083 --> 01:23:12.458
But we inject a substance
that blocks the memory.

740
01:23:12.958 --> 01:23:15.292
I knew torture would be involved.

741
01:23:15.875 --> 01:23:18.333
She totally forgot her memories.

742
01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:21.500
It's as if she has lost her memory.

743
01:23:21.833 --> 01:23:23.417
She swims and swims.

744
01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:25.042
She swims.

745
01:23:26.125 --> 01:23:27.167
She swims...

746
01:23:30.083 --> 01:23:31.250
She swims...

747
01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:31.792
Mum...

748
01:24:37.667 --> 01:24:38.625
Mum?

749
01:26:23.083 --> 01:26:24.250
It's over.

750
01:26:33.875 --> 01:26:35.583
You shouldn't have died.

751
01:26:42.083 --> 01:26:43.667
No one dies aged six.

752
01:26:46.333 --> 01:26:47.375
Sorry.

753
01:26:50.542 --> 01:26:51.583
Sorry.

754
01:26:52.542 --> 01:26:53.917
It's not your fault.

755
01:26:55.542 --> 01:26:56.958
Of course it is.

756
01:26:58.083 --> 01:26:59.167
No.

757
01:27:01.333 --> 01:27:02.792
You were so young.

758
01:27:11.958 --> 01:27:13.333
You're so handsome.

759
01:27:23.417 --> 01:27:24.583
My little mum...

760
01:27:32.375 --> 01:27:33.583
It'll be ok.

761
01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:37.000
It'll be ok.

762
01:27:52.167 --> 01:27:54.375
After you died. it all fell apart.

763
01:27:55.042 --> 01:27:56.333
I was lost.

764
01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.458
What should I do?

765
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.208
I was waiting for who knows what.

766
01:28:03.542 --> 01:28:06.750
Then one day. at a street corner.
you appeared.

767
01:28:06.958 --> 01:28:08.750
As if nothing had happened.

768
01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:11.000
The way you do so well.

769
01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.250
It was obvious. A secret.

770
01:28:14.542 --> 01:28:15.542
Our secret.

771
01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:16.917
Exactly.

772
01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:19.458
The grief faded and I accepted it.

773
01:28:19.958 --> 01:28:21.375
You did well to summon me.

774
01:28:21.542 --> 01:28:22.958
As if I had a choice.

775
01:28:23.125 --> 01:28:25.750
True. at first.
it scared me a little.

776
01:28:26.792 --> 01:28:28.750
Everything scares you a little.

777
01:28:28.917 --> 01:28:29.958
Not true!

778
01:28:30.125 --> 01:28:31.333
You hypocrite.

779
01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:33.375
I'm a hypocrite?

780
01:28:33.708 --> 01:28:35.167
Coming from you?

781
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:39.000
Did you see him again?

782
01:28:39.167 --> 01:28:41.042
- Who?
- You know who.

783
01:28:42.208 --> 01:28:43.292
Your father?

784
01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:46.583
Yes. in Paris. on the street. by chance.

785
01:28:46.833 --> 01:28:48.000
What's he like?

786
01:28:49.125 --> 01:28:51.000
He has aged. He has changed.

787
01:28:51.667 --> 01:28:52.958
Like me. I suppose.

788
01:28:53.125 --> 01:28:54.042
No.

789
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.125
You're sweet.

790
01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:00.250
You didn't tell him?

791
01:29:02.042 --> 01:29:04.875
That you had been born
and that you died? No.

792
01:29:05.458 --> 01:29:07.000
There was no need.

793
01:29:07.333 --> 01:29:08.542
It was cruel.

794
01:29:10.875 --> 01:29:12.083
I've no idea.

795
01:29:12.708 --> 01:29:14.125
Maybe I should have.

796
01:29:15.125 --> 01:29:16.250
I don't know.

797
01:29:20.375 --> 01:29:21.917
It's a beautiful house.

798
01:29:23.333 --> 01:29:24.708
It was.

799
01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:52.750
What are you doing alone in the dark?

800
01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:55.458
Nothing.

801
01:29:59.208 --> 01:30:00.625
Did you fight again?

802
01:30:00.792 --> 01:30:01.750
Yes.

803
01:30:02.167 --> 01:30:03.625
Over a girl again?

804
01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:06.208
Why then?

805
01:30:06.583 --> 01:30:08.167
She has soft skin.

806
01:30:08.708 --> 01:30:10.042
That's no reason.

807
01:30:10.875 --> 01:30:13.000
How do you know her skin's soft?

808
01:30:13.833 --> 01:30:17.708
I hold her hand and the skin
under her wrist is soft.

809
01:30:17.917 --> 01:30:20.125
Where do you get your aggressiveness?

810
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:22.083
Not from me anyhow.

811
01:30:22.917 --> 01:30:24.208
My father. maybe?

812
01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:25.292
No.

813
01:30:26.333 --> 01:30:28.708
No. Doug wasn't like that.

814
01:30:30.667 --> 01:30:34.000
I think you have to know
how to defend yourself in life.

815
01:30:37.708 --> 01:30:39.708
I must tell you something. my love.

816
01:30:40.208 --> 01:30:41.250
What?

817
01:30:43.042 --> 01:30:45.708
Your presence has helped
all these years.

818
01:30:45.875 --> 01:30:47.875
I know. I noticed.

819
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.083
But I need you to leave now.

820
01:30:53.458 --> 01:30:54.917
I can manage differently.

821
01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:56.292
I can tell.

822
01:31:00.292 --> 01:31:02.042
You want me to go?

823
01:31:08.292 --> 01:31:09.458
Are you sad?

824
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
No.

825
01:31:18.917 --> 01:31:21.250
I can tell you are. I'm your mother.

826
01:31:25.708 --> 01:31:27.292
Is it over then?

827
01:31:29.708 --> 01:31:30.708
Yes.

828
01:33:31.042 --> 01:33:32.083
You came.

829
01:33:33.417 --> 01:33:34.792
You're stubborn.

830
01:33:36.208 --> 01:33:38.000
I sensed I had to.

831
01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:50.625
Are you ok?

832
01:33:52.167 --> 01:33:53.333
I'll be fine.

833
01:34:16.458 --> 01:34:17.917
The stairs creak a bit?

834
01:34:18.083 --> 01:34:20.250
Part of the charm of an old house.

835
01:34:20.417 --> 01:34:23.500
Old stones. creaking stairs.
banging shutters.

836
01:34:23.667 --> 01:34:26.167
- Why bother otherwise?
- I love it.

837
01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:27.500
Me too.

838
01:34:30.333 --> 01:34:34.292
This room faces south-west
and is sunny all day.

839
01:34:34.792 --> 01:34:36.542
The view is wonderful.

840
01:34:39.292 --> 01:34:41.708
There's direct access to the kitchen.

841
01:34:42.417 --> 01:34:46.792
Maybe we could demolish this
to open the kitchen to the dining room.

842
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.167
Good idea.

843
01:34:48.333 --> 01:34:49.792
Isn't it a bearing wall?

844
01:34:49.958 --> 01:34:54.083
Behind the cupboards. yes.
but you can put in an IPN beam.

845
01:34:54.375 --> 01:34:56.250
But this one can go.

846
01:35:01.458 --> 01:35:02.583
And the roof?

847
01:35:04.792 --> 01:35:05.958
It's great.

848
01:35:06.292 --> 01:35:07.583
In good condition?

849
01:35:08.292 --> 01:35:09.792
Never a problem.

850
01:35:11.375 --> 01:35:13.125
I'll let you talk it over.

851
01:35:13.292 --> 01:35:15.292
Feel free to go back upstairs.

852
01:35:15.625 --> 01:35:18.125
Any questions. I'll be in the garden.

853
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:20.292
- See you shortly.
- Thank you.

854
01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Is there a manual in German?

855
01:35:59.167 --> 01:36:02.250
No. my dear friend. only in French.

856
01:36:03.792 --> 01:36:06.125
You told them I was your gardener?

857
01:36:06.458 --> 01:36:09.625
Yes. I suggested
making you part of the deal.

858
01:36:09.792 --> 01:36:11.458
Not gifted. but cheap.

859
01:36:12.917 --> 01:36:14.208
I'm flattered.

860
01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:16.500
Are they interested?

861
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.417
Hard to say. The husband's fussy.

862
01:36:19.583 --> 01:36:23.292
I said I had someone
coming back tomorrow with an offer.

863
01:36:23.625 --> 01:36:24.750
That's not true.

864
01:36:24.917 --> 01:36:26.875
Yes. but it got them thinking.

865
01:36:28.208 --> 01:36:32.542
Why mow a lawn
since the grass always grows back?

866
01:36:33.167 --> 01:36:35.167
It's the cycle of life. right?

867
01:36:35.708 --> 01:36:36.875
So that's it.

868
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:38.250
Life.

869
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.333
How much longer?

870
01:36:42.833 --> 01:36:44.625
I love you. Mr Tim Ardenne.

871
01:36:45.625 --> 01:36:47.292
You saved my life. sir.

872
01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.125
It was an honour to meet you.

873
01:36:53.292 --> 01:36:56.375
No. we said we'd never say such things.

874
01:36:57.250 --> 01:36:58.667
I might cry.

875
01:37:00.083 --> 01:37:01.500
My bad.

876
01:37:05.958 --> 01:37:09.083
As a child. I hated daylight.
It terrified me.

877
01:37:09.292 --> 01:37:10.875
Now. I find it reassuring.

878
01:37:11.417 --> 01:37:13.833
We should move closer to the poles.

879
01:37:14.583 --> 01:37:16.708
Go where the sun never sets?

880
01:37:17.333 --> 01:37:18.125
Good idea.

881
01:37:18.292 --> 01:37:19.458
Greenland.

882
01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.542
We'd live in an igloo.

883
01:37:23.083 --> 01:37:26.542
We'd cut holes in the ice to fish.

884
01:37:27.167 --> 01:37:28.500
You hate the cold.

885
01:37:28.667 --> 01:37:31.958
but I'll buy you thick sweaters
and scarves.

886
01:37:33.250 --> 01:37:34.458
Woollen ones.

887
01:37:35.375 --> 01:37:36.875
And a woolly hat too.

888
01:37:37.792 --> 01:37:39.083
It would suit you.

889
01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:16.292
