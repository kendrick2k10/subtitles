(man sobbing)

4
00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:05.733
- I'm in a lot of pain.

5
00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:09.658
I never wanted this to happen.

7
00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.625
I just want it to stop.

8
00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:14.723
- Greg. Greg. it'll be okay.

9
00:00:14.773 --> 00:00:16.430
Let's go and get to a doctor.

10
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.620
Let's get outta here.

11
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.750
Come on. come with me.

12
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.042
It'll be okay.

13
00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:22.048
- I need your blood.

14
00:00:22.098 --> 00:00:22.881
- Huh?

15
00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:24.197
- I need your blood!

16
00:00:25.362 --> 00:00:28.529

18
00:00:38.552 --> 00:00:39.335
No!

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:41.810
(men physically struggling
with one another)

20
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.138
- Oh God. no. don't!

21
00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:48.468
(man yells muffled words
and gasps last breath)

22
00:00:48.518 --> 00:00:52.018
(Greg sobbing)
- I'm sorry!

23
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.553
I'm so sorry!

24
00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:05.960
(footsteps crunching on rocks)

25
00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:09.749
(Greg choking up a cough)

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:16.779
(static buzzes)

27
00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:24.956
(dramatic music)

28
00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:13.883
- Something in my tooth right here.

29
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.070
If I look familiar.

30
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.800
it's because I am the
older brother of Greg...

31
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.390
Sanders

32
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.510
who...

33
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:39.630
became famous after the video

34
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.100
known as "The Last Five Days"

35
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.453
kinda went viral.

36
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.710
My hands look

37
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.413
big from this angle.

38
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.830
So...

39
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.153
My name is Chuckie.

40
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.610
Chuck.

41
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.773
you can call me Chuck.

42
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.030
I. like many others. lost my
job recently due to the whole

43
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.440
COVID-19

44
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.190
pandemic. so. you know.

45
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.003
there's that.

46
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.340
But after talking to my wife

47
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.290
about some things that
have gone on in my life

48
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.440
I decided that it was time to

49
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.490
resolve or attempt to resolve some issues.

50
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.493
And my family has had a big
one for about 10 years now.

51
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.383
Weird. that's a weird plant.

52
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.283
This is my friend's house.

53
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.220
I'm staying here because...

54
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.280
It's close to...

55
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.640
the house that "The Last Five
Days" video was recorded in.

56
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.170
And the landlord is supposedly selling

57
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.380
the house after all these years

58
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.350
and there's a bunch of boxes and stuff

59
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.400
that the landlord thought maybe
some of it belonged to me.

60
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.910
or not me but my brother

61
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.360
and wanted me to go through
and see if any of it

62
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.760
was worth keeping so I'm gonna...

63
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.303
do that and like. look... at it.

64
00:04:41.457 --> 00:04:43.160
Greg. I...

65
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.830
can't promise you that anything
is gonna come from this. but

66
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.340
I always found it odd
that there was never a

67
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.500
definitive answer to what happened

68
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.573
in that video.

69
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.400
So I ordered something...

70
00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:12.959
(unwrapping package)

71
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.273
to help stabilize my videos.

72
00:05:17.323 --> 00:05:18.490
See how it works.

73
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.223
This looks like the place.

74
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.117
This thing is like jammed though.

75
00:05:26.773 --> 00:05:27.606
Oh!

76
00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:30.151
Mother fuck.

77
00:05:37.148 --> 00:05:38.398
Ah!
There we go.

78
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:53.993
(keys jingling)
Let's go.

79
00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:01.304
(car door shuts)

80
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.953
Someone else here.

81
00:06:10.271 --> 00:06:11.521
I don't really like that.

82
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.075
Let's see if this works.
(keys rattling)

83
00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:21.667
(door pops open)
Apparently so.

84
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.713
Hello?

85
00:06:29.507 --> 00:06:31.924
(door shuts)

86
00:06:36.073 --> 00:06:37.540
Uh. excuse me.

87
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.373
Hello?

88
00:06:38.423 --> 00:06:39.256
- Oh. geez.

89
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.530
You scared the shit outta me there. buddy.

90
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.790
- Oh. I'm sorry. but...

91
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.763
Who are you?

92
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.093
- Detective Sanchez.

93
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.443
You're the brother. aren't you?

94
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.293
- Probably.

95
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.760
Greg. Greg's brother?

96
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.643
Yes.

97
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.783
My name's Chuck.

98
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.890
- You look just like him.

99
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.343
It's just uncanny.

100
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.687
- One of us looks better than the other.

101
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.700
- We tried to get in contact with you

102
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.863
for about a month after the incident.

103
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.013
Even went to the funeral
but you weren't there.

104
00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:28.147
- I was in a dark place.

105
00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:31.880
I didn't get along with my family.

106
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.123
especially Greg.

107
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.830
But...

108
00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.980
- Yeah.

109
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.471
I'm just here checking the
place out and there's a...

110
00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:48.071
There's a special they're
doing on the incident.

111
00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:50.360
- A special?

112
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.710
- Yeah.

113
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.100
- Like CNN or something?

114
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.933
- It's kinda like that.

115
00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:56.590
It's more like a local
news network. but they...

116
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.050
- Is it okay if I film this

117
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.933
by the way?

118
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:00.963
- Yeah. sure.

119
00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:01.846
That's fine.

120
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.530
Yeah. just...

121
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.723
Great.

122
00:08:07.773 --> 00:08:11.280
I'm used to asking other people
if I can film them. not...

123
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.163
- Yeah.

124
00:08:13.141 --> 00:08:14.875
I bet.

125
00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:17.883
- I guess you guys had that in
common when it came to that.

126
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.120
So anyway...

127
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:25.060
They're set to demolish
this in about two weeks.

128
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.520
It's a shame though.

129
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.600
- They're tearing it down?

130
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.433
- Yeah.

131
00:08:29.483 --> 00:08:30.363
- I didn't hear that.

132
00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:35.780
- The owner of the place after

133
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.862
your brother's unfortunate passing...

134
00:08:38.912 --> 00:08:42.590
He tried to rent it out to several people.

135
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.883
I guess the news coverage was too much.

136
00:08:45.883 --> 00:08:49.720
And couldn't keep it rented
by anybody for very long.

137
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.433
Everybody that came just
left a bunch of shit here.

138
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.700
- There is a lot of stuff.

139
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.170
Whoa!

140
00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.680
Can I have this?

141
00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.900
- It's not mine to give.

142
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.673
- Oh.
Well it's mine then.

143
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.820
- Sure. yeah whatever.

144
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.163
- Yeah. I suppose everybody
has seen the tape.

145
00:09:14.803 --> 00:09:18.036
(dialing phone)

146
00:09:18.086 --> 00:09:19.790
(phone clicking onto receiver)

147
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.280
- The owner gave you a key. you said?

148
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.163
- Yeah.

149
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.740
- How long are you...

150
00:09:30.175 --> 00:09:31.575
planning on staying in town?

151
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.020
- I don't know.

152
00:09:35.797 --> 00:09:37.120
Didn't really

153
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.573
plan the trip that way.

154
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.423
Just kinda however long it takes.

155
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.730
See if I can find out what's going on.

156
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.020
what happened...

157
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.480
- Really could've used your help.

158
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.900
- Oh. I'm no detective.

159
00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.150
- After it happened. we
had a lot of questions.

160
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.880
- So...

161
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.520
Did anyone ever look into the.

162
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.743
the fruit or anything?

163
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.560
- Yeah. I mean there was a

164
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.370
little wooden box.

165
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:17.652
- Yeah.

166
00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:18.927
- It's on the video.

167
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.320
I mean. don't get me wrong.

168
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.800
We did all the tests we
possibly could on Greg.

169
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.498
- I mean. thank you for
everything you guys do and...

170
00:10:26.548 --> 00:10:27.710
- You know. again. I'm
sorry for your loss.

171
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.870
I don't mean to be so callous

172
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.423
and trying to-

173
00:10:31.473 --> 00:10:34.280
- It's been 10 years. I've had...

174
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.426
I've had time.

175
00:10:36.476 --> 00:10:38.703
- I had a card to give you.

176
00:10:40.788 --> 00:10:42.004
I think it's...

177
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.610
Yeah.

178
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:45.643
So. if you have any questions or anything

179
00:10:45.693 --> 00:10:46.490
or you need anything from me.

180
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.870
please just give me a call.

181
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.703
Okay?

182
00:10:48.753 --> 00:10:49.586
- Sure.

183
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.550
- Sorry.
Again.

184
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.100
I don't know what else to say.

185
00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.713
I'll get out of your hair.

186
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.383
All right.

187
00:11:00.433 --> 00:11:01.266
- Yep.

188
00:11:07.149 --> 00:11:09.816
(water running)

189
00:11:27.162 --> 00:11:29.295
(bird squawking)

190
00:11:29.345 --> 00:11:30.545
Damn bird.

191
00:11:34.053 --> 00:11:35.636
(Chuck belching)

192
00:11:37.278 --> 00:11:40.111
(paper crunching)

193
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:05.799
What the heck?

194
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.460
Yeah. that looks like it belonged to Greg!

195
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.890
Ooh. looks like it got
used pretty well. too.

196
00:12:24.391 --> 00:12:27.191
(Chuck opens and closes door)

197
00:12:27.241 --> 00:12:30.158
(insects chirping)

198
00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:38.840
(wind chimes blowing in breeze)

199
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.810
Dang. Greg.

200
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.040
How could you afford this?

201
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.873
This backyard is nice.

202
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.093
Like...

203
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.080
You could throw

204
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.720
the best party

205
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.183
ever.

206
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.823
So...

207
00:13:10.106 --> 00:13:12.507
(Chuck nervously laughs)

208
00:13:14.165 --> 00:13:17.915
This is the spot where
they found Greg's body.

209
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.203
10 years ago.

210
00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.263
The tree looks different
than in the... video.

211
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.140
Maybe it's a different tree or...

212
00:14:15.735 --> 00:14:17.818
Guess I could take these.

213
00:14:41.227 --> 00:14:44.060
(thunder rolling)

214
00:14:44.987 --> 00:14:46.154
(Chuck sniffs)

215
00:14:48.503 --> 00:14:52.564
(flipping light switch)

216
00:14:52.614 --> 00:14:53.781
What the heck?

217
00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:17.001
(distant thunder)

218
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.513
Yeah. 'cause that's not creepy.

219
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.550
That's actually really creepy.

220
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.140
It's the only thing in here.

221
00:15:52.043 --> 00:15:54.409
(Chuck sighing)

222
00:16:05.652 --> 00:16:07.518
(door thudding)

223
00:16:13.964 --> 00:16:15.280
No way.

224
00:16:37.384 --> 00:16:39.309
This is something.

225
00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:44.851
(knocking on door)

226
00:16:46.231 --> 00:16:47.064
Coming.

227
00:16:48.898 --> 00:16:51.093
(opens door)

228
00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:51.987
Hi.

229
00:16:52.037 --> 00:16:52.820
- Hi.

230
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.653
- You must be Sarah?

231
00:16:53.703 --> 00:16:54.486
- Yeah.

232
00:16:54.536 --> 00:16:55.343
- Nice to-

233
00:16:55.393 --> 00:16:56.176
- Nice to meet you.

234
00:16:56.226 --> 00:16:57.283
- Come on in.

235
00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.043
I'm gonna film this.

236
00:17:01.093 --> 00:17:02.300
That's okay. right?

237
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.133
- Yeah.

238
00:17:03.183 --> 00:17:04.020
- Okay.

239
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.095
Go ahead and take a seat on the couch.

240
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.010
So I don't want to take
too much of your time.

241
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.260
I just. you know.

242
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.480
wanna talk to you about
living next to my brother

243
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:25.710
while he was in school.

244
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.780
I know your. your family lived next door.

245
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:28.613
Right?

246
00:17:28.663 --> 00:17:30.660
- Yeah.
We lived next door

247
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:33.200
when I was probably like 12 or 13

248
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.120
they moved in.

249
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.350
- Okay.

250
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.183
I know they.

251
00:17:37.233 --> 00:17:38.760
they didn't live at
the house for too long.

252
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:40.790
You know. my brother and his friend were.

253
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.960
were college students renting it.

254
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.770
So they. they didn't have
a whole lot of money.

255
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.033
- Yeah.

256
00:17:45.083 --> 00:17:45.960
- I think they were only there for like

257
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.610
a total of like eight or nine months.

258
00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.160
- Yeah I remember when they moved in.

259
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:51.980
my parents were not

260
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.143
too excited to have
college boys next door-

261
00:17:53.193 --> 00:17:55.520
- I'm sure college boys. you know...

262
00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.050
They're. they're a bit rowdy.

263
00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:59.330
My brother was a little
bit of a rebel. so...

264
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.263
- Yeah.

265
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.313
- What do you remember about.

266
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.250
you know. the night of the...

267
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.300
the incident where they
ended up. you know. they...

268
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:13.193
They passed away.

269
00:18:13.243 --> 00:18:16.493
What do you remember about like that time?

270
00:18:16.543 --> 00:18:19.645
- You know. I remember that
night but it was really

271
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.730
the night before that I have a memory of.

272
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.680
- Well you told me over the phone that

273
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.270
you actually might have some information

274
00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.090
that hasn't really been
disclosed at this time.

275
00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.052
- Yeah.
- Do you mind going into more

276
00:18:34.102 --> 00:18:35.680
detail?
- Well...

277
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:40.020
My family and I had gone
for a walk the night before

278
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:44.600
they died and I kinda strayed and

279
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.370
went to the park that was near our house

280
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.730
and Greg was at the park.

281
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:51.630
which wasn't weird.

282
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.230
Like I saw Greg around
the neighborhood but

283
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.203
he was eating sand.

284
00:18:57.253 --> 00:18:58.190
- Just...

285
00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.830
- Just eating sand.

286
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.501
- Like handfuls?

287
00:19:01.551 --> 00:19:05.400
- Like handfuls! Like
aggressively eating sand.

288
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:07.330
And I was like. I didn't know what...

289
00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.020
It startled me.
It scared me.

290
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.420
It was weird and I didn't know what to do

291
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:13.110
so I just ran back with my family and

292
00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.891
I never said anything.

293
00:19:14.941 --> 00:19:16.520
- Yeah. That's. that's weird.

294
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.480
That's something that obviously
didn't happen on camera.

295
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.340
you know?
No one...

296
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.330
If he wandered off.

297
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.380
no one would know because on the tape.

298
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.330
that's the night that Brian went and

299
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.540
stayed by himself at a hotel. so

300
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.083
if he wasn't filming it.

301
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.710
no one knows what happened.

302
00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.940
So that's. that's interesting.

303
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.680
And it was just at the
playground in your neighborhood?

304
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.513
- Just in our neighborhood park.

305
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:45.950
- Can we go and look at it?

306
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.768
- Yeah.

307
00:19:47.818 --> 00:19:49.434
This is the park.

308
00:19:49.484 --> 00:19:50.267
- This is it?

309
00:19:50.317 --> 00:19:51.920
- Yeah. I don't remember
that middle part though

310
00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:54.150
so they must have remodeled
since I've been here

311
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.883
'cause it looks a little different.

312
00:19:55.933 --> 00:19:58.279
- Well. it was all those years ago.

313
00:19:58.329 --> 00:19:59.245
so...
- Yeah.

314
00:19:59.295 --> 00:20:01.060
it's been 10 years
honestly since I've seen it

315
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.410
and they must've...

316
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.590
They must've replaced
the sand with wood chips

317
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.450
'cause that was not there obviously.

318
00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.333
- Yeah.

319
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.830
Interesting.

320
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.663
- Yeah.

321
00:20:10.713 --> 00:20:11.950
- So where was Greg

322
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.510
when you saw him that night?

323
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.580
- So I was just walking right on that

324
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:19.040
sidewalk and Greg was
right here by the swings.

325
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:19.873
- Just right there?

326
00:20:19.923 --> 00:20:21.180
- Just right here.

327
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.063
- Okay.

328
00:20:23.094 --> 00:20:23.877
Would you.

329
00:20:23.927 --> 00:20:24.710
would you mind holding this?

330
00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.084
- Yeah.

331
00:20:26.134 --> 00:20:27.337
- I'm just gonna take a

332
00:20:27.387 --> 00:20:29.056
little bit of a better look real quick.

333
00:20:29.106 --> 00:20:29.939
- Okay.

334
00:20:48.632 --> 00:20:50.965
- No. what are you doing?
No!

335
00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.280
- I got this email from a
friend of mine who suggested

336
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.520
that I look into this Airbnb...

337
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:04.830
And the reason is because it

338
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.350
might belong to the Verbin family

339
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.260
or maybe even belonged to Verbin himself.

340
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.170
I don't know if it's the house

341
00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.260
referred to in the original video.

342
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:19.900
but you know I figured
why not look into it?

343
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.240
I have nothing better to do.

344
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.020
Oh geez.

345
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.750
The camera's not on my face.

346
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.653
I'm sorry.

347
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.743
Just making a quick pit stop.

348
00:22:20.416 --> 00:22:22.408
(radio playing music)

349
00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.540
I don't feel like I would
be very good at vlogging.

350
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.653
I don't. I don't ever know what to say.

351
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.136
Like ever.

352
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:45.229
(truck horn blares as it races by)

353
00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:46.112
Sorry!

354
00:22:48.953 --> 00:22:50.244
(music continues)

355
00:22:50.294 --> 00:22:52.877
(wind blowing)

356
00:23:02.374 --> 00:23:07.291
(Chuck's footsteps trekking across ground)

357
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.063
That is not a bad view.

358
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.450
All right. so I'm...

359
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.800
at Verbin's place.

360
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:29.010
I guess that's what I'm calling it now?

361
00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.523
Or Verbin's vacation rental.

362
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.810
Whatever.

363
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.510
I'm not expecting to find anything

364
00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.770
so I brought a little
something to sip on tonight

365
00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.383
because I don't want to be bored.

366
00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:50.370
(digital door lock clicking)
(lock twisting open)

367
00:23:54.526 --> 00:23:58.443
(door squeaks open)

368
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.043
Oh. I love squeaky doors.

369
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.261
Well. yeah. this.

370
00:24:11.311 --> 00:24:13.443
this just looks like an Airbnb.

371
00:24:17.615 --> 00:24:19.180
Except for this...

372
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.063
sheet.

373
00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:23.383
That's weird.

374
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.273
Look a mirror.

375
00:24:27.323 --> 00:24:28.930
Hi. me!

376
00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:29.813
Hi. Chuckie.

377
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:41.596
Is that a hammock?

378
00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:44.803
Nice!

379
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.674
Well. I totally know where
I'm sleeping tonight.

380
00:24:48.724 --> 00:24:50.752
(flashlight starts rolling across table)

381
00:24:50.802 --> 00:24:52.086
What the heck?

382
00:24:52.136 --> 00:24:55.969
(flashlight crashes to floor)

383
00:25:05.922 --> 00:25:07.500
(Chuck chuckles nervously)

384
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.383
Oh man.

385
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.813
That was a terrible coincidence.

386
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.150
Let's check out the rest of the place.

387
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.783
Towels. for cleansing the body.

388
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:38.410
Wonder who she is?

389
00:25:42.213 --> 00:25:43.490
Well this bed

390
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.063
looks pretty comfortable.

391
00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:48.823
Oh. yeah!

392
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.963
Oh. that felt good after a long drive.

393
00:25:55.981 --> 00:25:57.031
Holy shit.

394
00:25:59.566 --> 00:26:02.983
(Chuck sighs)

395
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:09.002
What am I doing?

396
00:26:11.173 --> 00:26:13.923
I'm not gonna find anything here.

397
00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:26.945
(Chuck sighs)

398
00:26:29.853 --> 00:26:31.936
Well. at least I got you.

399
00:26:34.614 --> 00:26:37.397
This end table is a little far.

400
00:26:40.209 --> 00:26:43.792
(bottle cap twisting open)

401
00:27:02.218 --> 00:27:03.385
Here's to you.

402
00:27:04.721 --> 00:27:05.554
Gregory.

403
00:27:14.303 --> 00:27:15.136
Ah.

404
00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.663
This is nice.

405
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.891
Yeah.

406
00:27:28.941 --> 00:27:29.941
On second thought...

407
00:27:35.369 --> 00:27:36.947
(glass door sliding open)

408
00:27:36.997 --> 00:27:39.610
Whoop. spilled a little bit.

409
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.493
My bad.

410
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.093
Oh yeah.

411
00:27:56.405 --> 00:27:58.290
Oh. I could get used to this.

412
00:28:13.278 --> 00:28:16.195
(clicking lighter)

413
00:28:19.477 --> 00:28:22.977
(cicadas loudly chirping)

414
00:29:06.647 --> 00:29:07.430
Oh. geez!

415
00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:11.014
(glass door sliding open)

416
00:29:33.843 --> 00:29:34.940
I've always wanted to do this.

417
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.617
but I don't want. like. anyone to see.

418
00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.283
(panting heavily)

419
00:29:55.685 --> 00:29:56.518
Woo!

420
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:05.360
I put the glass down in the rocks

421
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.290
over there.

422
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.465
I just figured I'd drink from the bottle.

423
00:30:14.942 --> 00:30:15.925
Oh yeah.

424
00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.258
It's gone.

425
00:30:34.829 --> 00:30:36.974
How do I get...

426
00:30:37.024 --> 00:30:41.291
(Chuck falls out of hammock. chuckles)

427
00:30:52.372 --> 00:30:53.205
Whoa.

428
00:30:56.815 --> 00:30:59.732
(cicadas chirping)

429
00:31:07.551 --> 00:31:10.201
I have to pee.

430
00:31:13.801 --> 00:31:15.634
Oh. I have to pee. oh!

431
00:31:24.637 --> 00:31:27.470
(Chuck urinating)

432
00:31:28.576 --> 00:31:29.709
Ah!
Gosh.

433
00:31:47.006 --> 00:31:49.839
(toilet flushing)

434
00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:01.133
This place has the same
wine that I brought.

435
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.863
Oh man.

436
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.513
Yeah. Gregory!

437
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.170
Woo!
Brother!

438
00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.512
From the same mother!

439
00:32:24.469 --> 00:32:26.235
(Chuck groans as he falls to floor)

440
00:32:26.285 --> 00:32:27.118
I'm okay!

441
00:32:38.567 --> 00:32:40.303
Not even dark yet.

442
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.193
Where's the stop button?

443
00:32:46.243 --> 00:32:47.760
The stop one...

444
00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.163
I'm just gonna take like a quick nap.

445
00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.601
like an hour.

446
00:33:04.651 --> 00:33:07.560
I'll set my watch and then I'll.

447
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:08.870
I'll get serious about this.

448
00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.757
I promise.

449
00:33:09.807 --> 00:33:11.265
I just...

450
00:33:11.315 --> 00:33:12.630
I need to take a little nap.

451
00:33:16.756 --> 00:33:18.256
Just a little nap.

452
00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.783
Well my nap was nice.

453
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:29.893
I decided to eat something.

454
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:37.703
That way I had something
else in my stomach.

455
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:43.603
I brought some of the
fruit from the other house.

456
00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.457
It just looks like

457
00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.080
any other fruit. smaller obviously.

458
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.713
but something you'd
find at a grocery store.

459
00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:57.963
I don't know.

460
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:04.190
I haven't seen any on this property yet

461
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.683
but I haven't. you know.
really been outside sober.

462
00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:13.273
So when I go looking
I'll keep my eyes peeled.

463
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.433
In the meantime.

464
00:34:17.058 --> 00:34:19.880
No. I'm not eating that shit.

465
00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:21.080
I'm not doing it.

466
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:22.023
Not eating it.

467
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:26.343
Nope.

468
00:34:27.991 --> 00:34:29.600
I'm not eating it.

469
00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:30.483
I'm not.

470
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.173
Period!

471
00:34:35.493 --> 00:34:36.430
End of discussion.

472
00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.343
I might still be a little drunk.

473
00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:43.493
Welcome back to my vlog.

474
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:46.413
Let me try that again.

475
00:34:46.463 --> 00:34:47.296
I can be more...

476
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.413
insightful.

477
00:34:52.258 --> 00:34:54.103
Welcome back to Chuckie's vlog.

478
00:34:56.967 --> 00:34:58.390
Yeah. whatever.

479
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.640
That soup upset my stomach. by the way.

480
00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:01.523
Campbell's.

481
00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:08.180
You know I read somewhere that

482
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:10.920
engraved images of Buddha is bad luck.

483
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:14.120
So just. you know. sh!

484
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.193
Don't tell anyone.

485
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.723
No one has to know.

486
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:26.170
There's a lot of various
religious artifacts

487
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.193
and paintings and stuff in this house.

488
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.233
It's kinda weird.

489
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.833
I don't know.

490
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:37.713
Well. whatever.

491
00:35:37.763 --> 00:35:39.910
I'm gonna walk the property
before it gets too dark

492
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.360
and see if I can find anything. so...

493
00:35:48.058 --> 00:35:48.974
Hello?

494
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:51.783
Excuse me.

495
00:35:55.364 --> 00:35:56.531
What the fuck?

496
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:00.443
Hello?

497
00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:24.212
I gotta get some shoes
before I go down there.

498
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:37.873
Got my gun for safety.

499
00:36:39.925 --> 00:36:41.683
and this really bright flashlight.

500
00:36:44.004 --> 00:36:46.921
(cicadas chirping)

501
00:37:23.927 --> 00:37:26.159
They're gonna find my body out here.

502
00:37:26.209 --> 00:37:28.159
Or actually just not my body. my bones.

503
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.250
There's gonna be nothing left of me.

504
00:38:00.562 --> 00:38:01.395
Hello?

505
00:38:36.171 --> 00:38:37.379
A lot of bugs

506
00:38:40.357 --> 00:38:41.263
out here.

507
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.180
This is a situation
where I don't know if I'm

508
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:25.203
happy that I'm alone or I'd
rather see something out here.

509
00:39:29.982 --> 00:39:30.899
What the...

510
00:39:33.229 --> 00:39:34.062
Hello?

511
00:39:44.127 --> 00:39:46.320
I'm almost positive I just saw someone.

512
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.213
Hello?

513
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:13.927
Okay I don't...

514
00:40:17.873 --> 00:40:20.040
I don't see anything so...

515
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.110
My battery is getting kind of low

516
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.310
so I think I'm gonna...

517
00:40:26.999 --> 00:40:28.940
I'm gonna shut my phone
off for a few minutes.

518
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.077
I'm gonna keep following this trail and

519
00:40:33.294 --> 00:40:34.770
if I find anything or see anyone else

520
00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.570
I guess I'll keep you guys updated.

521
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.440
Okay. so...

522
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.603
Either this hat.

523
00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.990
it just like lives here or something

524
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.240
or there is someone and they dropped it.

525
00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.990
So I don't know if they like were.

526
00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:02.853
were running that way but there's a hat.

527
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:05.923
A hat is evidence.

528
00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.427
I don't wanna touch it though.

529
00:41:09.477 --> 00:41:10.644
I'm just gonna

530
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.048
go around it. just keep going.

531
00:41:17.667 --> 00:41:18.640
It looks like there's something up here

532
00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:22.500
so I. I don't know what's up there.

533
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.430
but I guess let's just keep going and.

534
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.880
and see if there's anything.

535
00:41:36.557 --> 00:41:37.690
All right.

536
00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.343
Welcome back to Chuckie's vlog.

537
00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.790
It's a working title. shut up.

538
00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.463
I'm pretty freaked out.

539
00:41:44.513 --> 00:41:45.480
There's a sign over here

540
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.900
that's preventing me
from going any further.

541
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:50.230
So unfortunately I guess this is.

542
00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.960
this is where the story ends and I...

543
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.100
I didn't find anything.

544
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.933
I didn't see anyone

545
00:41:53.983 --> 00:41:54.766
and it's...

546
00:41:54.816 --> 00:41:56.940
The sun's almost completely down

547
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.470
so it's. I'm gonna just.
you know. go back to...

548
00:42:02.223 --> 00:42:03.263
What the fuck?

549
00:42:04.459 --> 00:42:06.251
What the actual fuck?

550
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:10.623
Hello?

551
00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:12.846
Okay.

552
00:42:12.896 --> 00:42:14.250
There's gotta be.

553
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.230
There's gotta be someone
out here somewhere.

554
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.113
Hello?

555
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.155
What is that?

556
00:42:23.205 --> 00:42:24.510
Is that sand?

557
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.393
Hold on.

558
00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.900
There's like...

559
00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.900
something over there. like a ball or...

560
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.932
I don't know.

561
00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.653
Kinda looks like fruit.

562
00:42:47.167 --> 00:42:48.667
I don't know how deep that is.

563
00:42:52.654 --> 00:42:55.262
Okay. all right.

564
00:43:08.902 --> 00:43:10.553
I'm gonna cross this river.

565
00:43:11.425 --> 00:43:13.492
Oh. God I'm stupid.

566
00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.973
Okay. all right. I'm in.

567
00:43:19.023 --> 00:43:20.094
I'm in.

568
00:43:20.144 --> 00:43:23.644
(splashing through water)

569
00:43:28.194 --> 00:43:31.777
(small critters scurrying)

570
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:03.856
It's fruit.

571
00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:07.823
It's freaking big fruit!

572
00:44:15.972 --> 00:44:19.472
(splashing through water)

573
00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:33.968
It's fruit.

574
00:44:37.804 --> 00:44:38.587
(Chuck spitting)

575
00:44:38.637 --> 00:44:41.333
Bugs.
(spitting)

576
00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.703
It's really big fruit.

577
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:05.190
I don't know if it's the same fruit but

578
00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:06.740
this is kinda freaking me out.

579
00:45:23.136 --> 00:45:25.803
(water running)

580
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.370
My pants are dirty now. so

581
00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:37.053
just kinda trying to clean them off here.

582
00:45:38.814 --> 00:45:40.290
And since I'm by myself.

583
00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:44.257
I guess I'm gonna walk
around in my underpants.

584
00:46:03.675 --> 00:46:05.984
(water running)

585
00:46:18.237 --> 00:46:21.990
Okay so I came and sat over here

586
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:25.750
because those chairs. they...

587
00:46:27.403 --> 00:46:28.786
They kinda freaked me out.

588
00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.810
I guess my tablet's over there.

589
00:46:38.958 --> 00:46:40.286
I could grab my tablet.

590
00:46:41.269 --> 00:46:42.712
And uh...

591
00:46:43.929 --> 00:46:44.720
I don't know.

592
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:46.020
I just.

593
00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:46.903
I don't know.

594
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.673
Yeah.

595
00:46:54.452 --> 00:46:55.873
I'm gonna just get my tablet.

596
00:47:09.813 --> 00:47:10.771
Oh Jesus.

597
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.330
I'm gonna. I'm gonna
just look something up.

598
00:47:33.967 --> 00:47:35.450
I don't know. I feel like
I need to do something.

599
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.163
like... something's happening.

600
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:43.415
Hold on.

601
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:51.660
I've been sitting in this chair for

602
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.215
probably 20 minutes

603
00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.633
looking up Verbin.

604
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.090
using Verbin's

605
00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.773
WiFi

606
00:48:05.253 --> 00:48:07.268
and I'm not really finding anything!

607
00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.380
I don't know if there's anything to find.

608
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.680
I mean. something's...

609
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.250
something's happening but...

610
00:48:27.726 --> 00:48:29.559
In the original video.

611
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:34.840
my brother ate the fruit

612
00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:36.790
and then they started finding things out

613
00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.440
because more things started
happening to them. so...

614
00:48:45.514 --> 00:48:46.789
(Chuck grunts)

615
00:48:52.323 --> 00:48:54.220
I don't wanna do this but...

616
00:49:04.378 --> 00:49:06.170
I gotta eat the fruit.

617
00:49:08.313 --> 00:49:09.513
I have to eat the fruit.

618
00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:13.780
If there's anyone here

619
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.403
who thinks I shouldn't
eat the fruit. you know.

620
00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.255
say something!

621
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.690
Okay. I'm not lying when I say this but

622
00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.740
I'm a little bit freaked out about this.

623
00:49:47.048 --> 00:49:48.089
Got the fruit.

624
00:49:52.475 --> 00:49:54.225
I need a drink first.

625
00:50:00.467 --> 00:50:02.933
Oh gosh.

626
00:50:06.807 --> 00:50:07.890
Dropped the fruit.

627
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:13.000
Kinda freaks me out because

628
00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:17.910
when Greg took a bite of the fruit before

629
00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.923
things started happening right away.

630
00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:36.437
(Chuck breathing deeply)

631
00:50:40.352 --> 00:50:43.685
(coughing and choking)

632
00:50:45.943 --> 00:50:47.193
Oh. what the...

633
00:50:49.025 --> 00:50:49.975
What the...

634
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:59.423
Okay so I cleaned the bathroom up.

635
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:02.863
I don't know what that was.

636
00:51:08.791 --> 00:51:10.836
Yeah I. I don't know.

637
00:51:10.886 --> 00:51:11.719
I um...

638
00:51:14.239 --> 00:51:15.130
So good.

639
00:51:17.718 --> 00:51:18.885
What the heck?

640
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.040
Well. my nose is bleeding.

641
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:31.103
Okay. hold on.

642
00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:35.280
So I put tissue in my
nose to stop the bleeding

643
00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:37.300
and it seems to be working.

644
00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:38.160
and silly me.

645
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:41.490
I completely forgot that
I brought a second camera

646
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:46.010
to set up and now seems
like as good a time as any

647
00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.920
in case I get something. you know?

648
00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:51.280
So I'll just leave it
right here. facing the room

649
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.180
and we'll see what. what happens.

650
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:55.103
This is good.

651
00:51:55.153 --> 00:51:57.030
This is from the altitude.

652
00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:58.110
Like I'm positive!

653
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.463
My nose bleeds frequently.

654
00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:07.150
Actually. let's move this

655
00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.553
over to this side.

656
00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:11.980
I think I might be able to get more

657
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:16.135
of the room if I set it right there.

658
00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:19.013
Yeah.

659
00:52:33.168 --> 00:52:35.227
(rattling and gentle rushing of breath)

660
00:52:35.277 --> 00:52:37.280
(shivering and chattering)

661
00:52:37.330 --> 00:52:41.960
Anyway. like I said. this
is from the. the altitude

662
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:46.059
and I think I'll be able
to get a lot. you know

663
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.333
from right there.

664
00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:04.711
Wait. what?

665
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:12.300
Okay. so...

666
00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:16.710
I've been walking around the
house and a quick update.

667
00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.083
There's nothing.

668
00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:21.090
There's nothing to see.

669
00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.930
I keep hearing things though.

670
00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:25.350
It sounds like whispering or.

671
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.910
or maybe people are outside.

672
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:27.743
I don't know.

673
00:53:27.793 --> 00:53:29.040
I guess I.

674
00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:30.153
I can go check.

675
00:53:32.366 --> 00:53:34.690
I didn't even think about it. you know?

676
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.573
Ow!

677
00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:40.225
Ow. my thumb.

678
00:53:40.275 --> 00:53:42.191
This is just not my day.

679
00:53:52.852 --> 00:53:54.019
What the fuck?

680
00:54:02.087 --> 00:54:04.247
My fuckin' nail just came off!

681
00:54:18.346 --> 00:54:21.513
(animals howling out)

682
00:55:03.411 --> 00:55:06.161
(Chuck vomiting)

683
00:55:25.003 --> 00:55:28.467
I don't really feel like
I'm myself right now.

684
00:55:29.407 --> 00:55:30.473
(screen breaks)

685
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.567
(clawing at the wall)

686
00:56:23.724 --> 00:56:27.974
(knocking head against glass door)

687
00:56:39.768 --> 00:56:43.185
(Chuck gasps for breath)

688
00:56:50.817 --> 00:56:54.067
(Chuck exhales slowly)

689
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:48.120
(crawling on floor)

690
00:58:06.578 --> 00:58:09.331
(giggles creepily)

691
00:58:09.381 --> 00:58:12.964
(Chuck collapses to floor)

692
00:58:18.448 --> 00:58:21.865
(Chuck giggles creepily)

693
00:58:51.776 --> 00:58:54.693
(glass shattering)

694
00:59:12.645 --> 00:59:16.395
(Chuck coughing and choking)

695
00:59:56.438 --> 00:59:58.096
(Chuck vomiting)

696
01:00:04.135 --> 01:00:06.093
(Chuck gasping for breath)

697
01:00:12.804 --> 01:00:13.887
Yeah. I...

698
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:18.483
I agree with you.

699
01:00:24.698 --> 01:00:26.514
(muffled whispers)

700
01:00:26.564 --> 01:00:29.130
(Chuck giggles)

701
01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:30.505
No. sh. sh. sh.

702
01:00:36.192 --> 01:00:38.942
(Chuck laughing)

703
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:42.030
Why. why can't we...

704
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:45.003
Why can't we do it right now?

705
01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.753
I just.

706
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:51.049
I don't understand.

707
01:00:53.423 --> 01:00:56.173
(Chuck laughing)

708
01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:06.673
I just wanna hurt myself.

709
01:01:07.783 --> 01:01:10.173
I thought you wanted me to hurt myself.

710
01:01:18.859 --> 01:01:21.609
(Chuck giggling)

711
01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:35.133
I don't like it when you
say things like that.

712
01:01:46.067 --> 01:01:48.767
(muffled whispers)

713
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.908
(violently gasping)

714
01:03:11.759 --> 01:03:13.542
(door opening)

715
01:03:45.968 --> 01:03:47.768
(chewing)

716
01:04:48.832 --> 01:04:50.265
(gun fires)

717
01:05:35.185 --> 01:05:37.626
(door opens)

718
01:05:42.691 --> 01:05:46.766
(dramatic eerie music)
