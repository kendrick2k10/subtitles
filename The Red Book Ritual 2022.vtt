3
00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:12.311
- The rules of the
game are these.

4
00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:16.876
One. go into a quiet room.

5
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:20.550
Two. place a candle
in the middle.

6
00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:23.355
Light it.

7
00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:26.160
Use a book with a red cover

8
00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:27.887
and without illustrations.

9
00:01:29.462 --> 00:01:33.299
Three. ask for permission
to enter the game

10
00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:35.499
and never quit the game

11
00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:37.501
without requesting
it from the book.

12
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.703
We're gonna need a
book with a red cover.

13
00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:44.409
- I have one in my room.

14
00:01:45.378 --> 00:01:47.742
- Are you sure your
parents aren't coming?

15
00:01:47.777 --> 00:01:49.183
- Yeah. I'm sure.

16
00:01:49.218 --> 00:01:50.481
My Daddy's working all night

17
00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:52.219
and my brother won't wake up

18
00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:53.913
even if there's
fireworks over his head.

19
00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:56.817
- And your mom?

20
00:01:57.786 --> 00:02:02.229
- It's just my dad. my
younger brother and me.

21
00:02:02.264 --> 00:02:03.659
My mom passed away.

22
00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:07.663
- Oh. I'm sorry. What happened?

23
00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:13.207
- A few months ago she had an
accident on her way to work.

24
00:02:13.242 --> 00:02:14.274
She was a doctor.

25
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.183
- I'm sorry.

26
00:02:23.648 --> 00:02:25.351
- Well. let's continue.

27
00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:26.451
Bring the book.

28
00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:33.821
Let's freak her out.

29
00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:35.559
- You're so evil.

30
00:02:35.594 --> 00:02:37.264
Oh. I love you baby.

31
00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.331
- Thank you.

32
00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:05.985
- Bea!

33
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.299
I had a nightmare.

34
00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:14.367
There was a horrible woman.

35
00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.478
- She is such a free.

36
00:03:30.715 --> 00:03:33.353
Now that is one creepy ass book.

37
00:03:33.388 --> 00:03:35.784
- It was already here
when we moved in.

38
00:03:40.857 --> 00:03:42.560
- It's perfect.

39
00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:50.337
Is that your cat?

40
00:03:51.173 --> 00:03:54.341
- No. it was already
in the house too.

41
00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:57.839
It must have belong to the woman
who was living here before.

42
00:03:57.874 --> 00:04:00.545
- Mmmh. it must be
the witch's cat.

43
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.414
- Yeah.

44
00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:04.582
- What witch?

45
00:04:04.617 --> 00:04:06.914
- Don't you know the
story of this house?

46
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.818
About the creepy old lady
who used to live here.

47
00:04:09.853 --> 00:04:12.821
The whole town says
she was a witch.

48
00:04:12.856 --> 00:04:14.757
She did satanic
rituals on animals

49
00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:17.958
and then one day
she disappeared.

50
00:04:17.993 --> 00:04:19.729
And that's her cat.

51
00:04:19.764 --> 00:04:24.404
- People say that cat
it's actually a demon

52
00:04:25.506 --> 00:04:28.474
that possesses its owners.

53
00:05:10.584 --> 00:05:11.352
- Bonnie!

54
00:05:44.618 --> 00:05:45.452
Bonnie!

55
00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:48.653
Bonnie!

56
00:05:56.762 --> 00:06:00.533
Bonnie. Bonnie. hey. hey.

57
00:06:02.064 --> 00:06:03.470
What happened?

58
00:06:03.505 --> 00:06:04.900
Are you okay?

59
00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:26.625
Hey.

60
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:29.056
I'm home.

61
00:06:40.707 --> 00:06:41.706
Where did you come from?

62
00:07:09.868 --> 00:07:12.803
Bonnie. what happened here?

63
00:07:14.741 --> 00:07:15.575
Bonnie?

64
00:07:19.977 --> 00:07:20.811
Bonnie.

65
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.684
Let's cover. cover you up.

66
00:07:31.692 --> 00:07:32.889
Bonnie. what are you doing?

67
00:07:35.597 --> 00:07:36.222
Bonnie!

68
00:07:42.197 --> 00:07:44.065
You can't be out here
like this. Bonnie.

69
00:08:13.998 --> 00:08:15.294
Argus?

70
00:08:21.005 --> 00:08:26.008
I missed you. Argus.

71
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.980
Come on.

72
00:08:54.841 --> 00:08:55.873
Argus. come on.

73
00:08:58.812 --> 00:08:59.943
Come on. let's go.

74
00:09:23.133 --> 00:09:24.066
Don't judge me.

75
00:09:30.712 --> 00:09:32.679
You'll enjoy this.

76
00:09:32.714 --> 00:09:34.945
Picked it up on
the way to Libya.

77
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.652
I thought Bonnie
would love this.

78
00:09:44.088 --> 00:09:46.990
That was a year ago.

79
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:56.670
Alright. buddy.

80
00:09:57.772 --> 00:09:59.068
You've had enough.

81
00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:33.069
Argus. no. no.

82
00:14:27.503 --> 00:14:29.206
I'm sorry. It was Argus.

83
00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:30.911
It happened so fast.

84
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.676
Bonnie no.

85
00:18:42.593 --> 00:18:43.889
- You're making fun of me.

86
00:18:45.497 --> 00:18:46.397
- Yeah. I'm sorry Bea

87
00:18:46.432 --> 00:18:48.267
but you see in your face though.

88
00:18:48.302 --> 00:18:50.665
You were freaking
out. it was amazing.

89
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.963
- I don't know if it's true.

90
00:18:51.998 --> 00:18:53.701
a friend told me that story.

91
00:18:53.736 --> 00:18:55.307
But the disappearance
of the old woman

92
00:18:55.342 --> 00:18:57.507
who used to live
here. that's true.

93
00:18:58.477 --> 00:19:02.182
Anyway. let's get back to rules.

94
00:19:03.515 --> 00:19:07.583
Four. close your eyes.

95
00:19:07.618 --> 00:19:11.290
place the palm of your
hand on the books cover

96
00:19:11.325 --> 00:19:13.391
and ask the following question.

97
00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:18.858
Red book. may I enter your game?

98
00:19:27.869 --> 00:19:30.804
"The sky suddenly turned dark."

99
00:19:32.412 --> 00:19:33.543
That's not a yes!

100
00:19:33.578 --> 00:19:35.380
It makes no sense.

101
00:19:35.415 --> 00:19:37.316
- But it's pretty is scary.

102
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:39.945
- Oh. come on Sophie.
this game is a scam.

103
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.914
- Are you frightened. babe?

104
00:19:41.949 --> 00:19:42.915
- Are you frightened babe?

105
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.488
- He's right. we
better leave it.

106
00:19:45.623 --> 00:19:46.820
- Let's try again.

107
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.335
- Red book. may
I enter your game?

108
00:20:01.837 --> 00:20:03.474
- "She opened door.

109
00:20:03.509 --> 00:20:06.378
and let in the
shadows of the past."

110
00:20:08.448 --> 00:20:09.513
- Is that a yes?

111
00:20:14.454 --> 00:20:15.321
- Did you hear that?

112
00:20:17.358 --> 00:20:18.324
- Ahh. no.

113
00:20:20.086 --> 00:20:21.525
- I don't wanna play this.

114
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.625
Let's watch a movie.

115
00:20:27.335 --> 00:20:29.335
- Is there anyone with us?

116
00:20:34.507 --> 00:20:36.001
"She was not alone.

117
00:20:36.036 --> 00:20:39.477
The shadows of the past
were always with her."

118
00:20:39.512 --> 00:20:41.446
This is awesome!

119
00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:42.777
- Okay. let me try.

120
00:20:42.812 --> 00:20:45.483
It's getting pretty good.

121
00:20:45.518 --> 00:20:46.352
Okay.

122
00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.391
How old am I?

123
00:20:59.697 --> 00:21:03.534
"They met October the 17th
at the Counts mansion."

124
00:21:07.738 --> 00:21:09.903
That makes no sense.

125
00:21:09.938 --> 00:21:12.378
- Wait. the people
who play this game

126
00:21:12.413 --> 00:21:14.941
argue that the answers
aren't always literal.

127
00:21:14.976 --> 00:21:18.010
Listen. October is month 10.

128
00:21:19.783 --> 00:21:21.013
- So?

129
00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:23.356
- And it says the 17th.

130
00:21:23.391 --> 00:21:25.017
10 plus 17 is 27.

131
00:21:29.155 --> 00:21:30.594
- Holy shit. it guessed it.

132
00:21:32.829 --> 00:21:33.729
It did.

133
00:21:33.764 --> 00:21:35.401
- You're fucking with me again.

134
00:21:35.436 --> 00:21:37.502
- I swear to you Bea.
this is not a joke.

135
00:21:37.537 --> 00:21:38.470
Your turn.

136
00:21:52.849 --> 00:21:56.081
If you don't believe
us. ask for proof.

137
00:22:01.726 --> 00:22:05.024
- If you're really
here with us. prove it.

138
00:22:06.632 --> 00:22:09.127
- But that's not a question
though. will it work?

139
00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:12.504
- "She screams loudly.
but no one can hear her."

140
00:22:13.639 --> 00:22:15.672
- What does it mean by that?

141
00:22:20.844 --> 00:22:23.713
- That scream came
from inside the house.

142
00:22:23.748 --> 00:22:25.682
- No. it truly came
from the street.

143
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.553
- It just wants
to scare us guys.

144
00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:32.623
- Do you realize that
she's in the house with us?

145
00:22:32.658 --> 00:22:33.954
I don't wanna play anymore.

146
00:22:33.989 --> 00:22:35.153
- We can't quit the game

147
00:22:35.188 --> 00:22:37.397
without asking
permission from the book.

148
00:22:39.665 --> 00:22:41.797
- Maybe we should ask
permission from the book.

149
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.678
- Red book. how can
we leave the game?

150
00:23:06.725 --> 00:23:07.856
- Sophie. that's not funny.

151
00:23:09.827 --> 00:23:11.992
Sophie stop joking.
that's enough.

152
00:23:12.027 --> 00:23:13.026
Sophie stop that.

153
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:14.764
Sophie...

154
00:23:20.739 --> 00:23:22.640
- What the fuck was that?

155
00:23:24.743 --> 00:23:26.039
- Okay. we gotta go.

156
00:23:26.074 --> 00:23:28.239
We gotta get the fuck outta
here right now. right now.

157
00:23:28.274 --> 00:23:30.714
- It's helping us.
didn't you see?

158
00:23:30.749 --> 00:23:31.682
- What?

159
00:23:31.717 --> 00:23:32.947
No I'm done with this shit.

160
00:23:32.982 --> 00:23:34.718
I just wanna get outta here.

161
00:23:34.753 --> 00:23:36.918
- If we leave the game.
we'll be in real danger.

162
00:23:36.953 --> 00:23:38.084
That's what it said.

163
00:23:42.992 --> 00:23:44.959
How many spirits are with us?

164
00:23:52.771 --> 00:23:53.605
Three.

165
00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:06.112
- Red book. how can we
get out of the game?

166
00:24:13.759 --> 00:24:17.123
"Read me."

167
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:19.928
- What? What does it mean?

168
00:24:35.011 --> 00:24:36.274
- It's a story.

169
00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:41.785
- I'll start.

170
00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:59.935
"She was sitting in the car

171
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.937
feeling pain and sadness."

172
00:25:17.856 --> 00:25:18.657
- Sorry.

173
00:25:39.746 --> 00:25:41.273
And this two. please.

174
00:26:30.962 --> 00:26:31.796
- Here.

175
00:26:37.034 --> 00:26:38.000
Does it hurt?

176
00:26:47.242 --> 00:26:48.879
Got you water too.

177
00:26:48.914 --> 00:26:49.814
If you wanna take
whatever they gave you-

178
00:26:49.849 --> 00:26:51.013
- Can you just take me home?

179
00:26:53.347 --> 00:26:54.247
- Yeah. of course.

180
00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.730
Hey. we'll try again. okay.

181
00:27:44.266 --> 00:27:46.398
Over there is nothing
that you could have done.

182
00:27:51.207 --> 00:27:53.141
Hey. come on. talk to me.

183
00:27:56.377 --> 00:27:58.311
- Do you think
that this is easy?

184
00:27:59.215 --> 00:28:00.412
- No. of course.

185
00:28:00.447 --> 00:28:01.787
- It was a part
of you too. Nick.

186
00:28:03.318 --> 00:28:04.383
- I know.
- Yeah.

187
00:28:05.892 --> 00:28:08.090
Well. it doesn't seem that way.

188
00:28:08.125 --> 00:28:09.157
Not this time.

189
00:28:10.325 --> 00:28:11.324
not last time.

190
00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:22.335
- What do you want me to say?

191
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.272
- I don't want you
to say anything.

192
00:28:34.217 --> 00:28:37.790
- Ever think that maybe-

193
00:28:37.825 --> 00:28:38.417
- What?

194
00:28:39.552 --> 00:28:40.452
- Nothing.

195
00:28:40.487 --> 00:28:41.387

00:28:42.588 --> 00:28:45.292
I don't know. Chloe!

198
00:28:45.327 --> 00:28:49.329
Maybe this is God trying
to tell us something.

199
00:28:49.364 --> 00:28:50.528
- God's trying tell
us something?...

200
00:28:50.563 --> 00:28:52.332
- Yes. I don't know.
I don't know...

201
00:28:52.367 --> 00:28:55.335
Maybe this isn't the
right time for us.

202
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:57.238
That we should wait
to do this later on.

203
00:29:08.053 --> 00:29:08.887
Fuck.

00:46:11.537 --> 00:46:12.371
Go.

371
00:46:21.118 --> 00:46:23.217
Nose. nose. nose lips.

372
00:46:26.519 --> 00:46:28.321
Nose. nose. nose. nose.

373
00:46:32.096 --> 00:46:34.360
Nose. nose. nose.
noes. nose. nose. nose.

374
00:46:39.367 --> 00:46:40.168
Ji-hyo.

375
00:47:37.656 --> 00:47:39.161
- Sophie. are okay.

376
00:47:40.263 --> 00:47:41.658
- Yeah. I'm fine.

377
00:47:41.693 --> 00:47:43.033
It happens sometimes.

378
00:47:48.106 --> 00:47:49.204
Did you hear that?

379
00:47:49.239 --> 00:47:50.469
- No.

380
00:47:50.504 --> 00:47:51.338
What do you hear?

381
00:48:06.586 --> 00:48:08.322
- Sophie. there's nothing there.

382
00:48:08.357 --> 00:48:09.521
It's not real.

383
00:48:09.556 --> 00:48:11.622
It's the book. it
makes you see things.

384
00:48:11.657 --> 00:48:12.491
Sophie.

385
00:48:15.628 --> 00:48:16.693
- No. it's next to me.

386
00:48:16.728 --> 00:48:18.431
- No. there's
nothing there Sophie.

387
00:48:18.466 --> 00:48:20.400
there is nothing there.

388
00:48:22.701 --> 00:48:25.141
- Fuck this. I'm out of here.

389
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.508
No. no. no. help me.

390
00:48:40.587 --> 00:48:41.421
- Sophie?

391
00:48:45.097 --> 00:48:45.722
Sophie.

392
00:48:48.529 --> 00:48:50.133
- Where is Sophie? Who took her?

393
00:48:52.665 --> 00:48:53.598
- Fuck!

394
00:48:55.041 --> 00:48:56.436
- "Keep reading."

395
00:48:59.111 --> 00:49:01.474
Maybe if we end the
game. we can help Sophie.

396
00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.613
- Let's finish this.

397
00:49:11.354 --> 00:49:15.422
- "She felt guilt and believed
that she could save him."

398
00:50:12.712 --> 00:50:13.612
- This is the last ward

399
00:50:13.647 --> 00:50:14.448
to be moved outta the hospital.

400
00:50:14.483 --> 00:50:15.746
Guys let's move.

401
00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:27.131
- Karla.

402
00:50:27.166 --> 00:50:28.330
- There's still more we can do.

403
00:50:28.365 --> 00:50:29.694
- That drug is just
keeping him a vegetable.

404
00:50:29.729 --> 00:50:32.169
- That drug is
keeping him alive.

405
00:50:32.204 --> 00:50:33.566
Judy?

406
00:50:33.601 --> 00:50:34.633
- Doctor.

407
00:50:34.668 --> 00:50:35.832
- We need another vial.

408
00:50:35.867 --> 00:50:37.207
- Well. there's none left here.

409
00:50:37.242 --> 00:50:38.571
Maybe in the East Wing

410
00:50:38.606 --> 00:50:40.771
but the places is a mess and-
- It's okay.

411
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.674
Okay.

412
00:50:43.611 --> 00:50:44.445
- Thanks.

413
00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:47.778
- Karla. this isn't
what he wanted.

414
00:50:47.813 --> 00:50:50.814
Keeping him alive
isn't right. it's time.

415
00:50:52.488 --> 00:50:54.455
- Let's go guys.

416
00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:56.226
All these patients need
to be in the new site.

417
00:50:56.261 --> 00:50:57.722
- Wait. listen to me.

418
00:50:58.857 --> 00:51:00.197
- He's my brother.

419
00:51:06.601 --> 00:51:09.602
- I can't believe they just
left east wing like that.

420
00:52:01.557 --> 00:52:02.622
- Lucky last.

421
00:52:51.409 --> 00:52:52.243
Shit!

422
00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:14.050
Who's there?

423
00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:53.694
- Karla.

424
00:55:15.014 --> 00:55:16.618
- Is anybody there?

425
00:55:19.821 --> 00:55:20.655
Somebody?

426
00:56:13.677 --> 00:56:14.203
No.

427
00:58:26.172 --> 00:58:27.105
Let me out.

428
00:58:28.944 --> 00:58:31.010
Please. please. let me out.

429
00:58:42.727 --> 00:58:43.957
What do you want?

430
00:58:57.236 --> 00:58:58.070
Blake?

431
00:59:14.154 --> 00:59:15.252
I can't.

432
01:02:08.229 --> 01:02:09.162
- What happened?

433
01:02:10.033 --> 01:02:10.867
Is it over?

434
01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.234
- That story was about my mama.

435
01:02:18.272 --> 01:02:19.502
- What do you mean?

436
01:02:29.855 --> 01:02:31.888
- We all bled on the book.

437
01:02:31.923 --> 01:02:32.988
On the stories.

438
01:02:36.224 --> 01:02:38.323
I think our blood
is fitting the book.

439
01:02:38.358 --> 01:02:39.489
It's giving life to it.

440
01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:41.524
- I don't care.

441
01:02:42.494 --> 01:02:44.967
I don't care. it's over.

442
01:02:50.172 --> 01:02:51.941
- We're not finished.

443
01:02:51.976 --> 01:02:53.404
There's another story here.

444
01:03:01.018 --> 01:03:01.852
Mom?

445
01:03:13.294 --> 01:03:14.062
- No. Bea.

446
01:03:15.197 --> 01:03:17.197
Bea that's. she's not real. Bea.

447
01:03:46.591 --> 01:03:47.392
Sophie?

448
01:03:48.967 --> 01:03:49.966
Is that you?

449
01:03:51.035 --> 01:03:53.398
- My love. it hurts.

450
01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:08.578
- Mom. is it you?

451
01:04:31.603 --> 01:04:32.470
Who are you?

452
01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:47.452
- England.
What have you become?

453
01:04:48.321 --> 01:04:51.390
What has happened to
your daughters and sons?

454
01:05:53.388 --> 01:05:55.289
- Are we ready. Magpie.

455
01:05:56.226 --> 01:05:57.390
- Yes. father.

456
01:05:59.823 --> 01:06:02.659
- For all have sinned.

457
01:06:02.694 --> 01:06:06.432
For all have sinned.

458
01:06:06.467 --> 01:06:11.470
- For all have sinned.
but we don't know

459
01:06:12.005 --> 01:06:14.737
how much we've sinned.

460
01:06:14.772 --> 01:06:16.376
Like a fish.

461
01:06:16.411 --> 01:06:18.807
doesn't understand the
concept that it is swimming

462
01:06:18.842 --> 01:06:20.083
in the river.

463
01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:22.679
It surrounds us.

464
01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:27.090
We were born and
conceived in it.

465
01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:30.423
Born into this fallen world.

466
01:06:34.231 --> 01:06:35.329
My friends.

467
01:06:36.728 --> 01:06:40.598
I've decided to deviate
from my planned topic today

468
01:06:41.467 --> 01:06:45.405
because we have
witnessed an abomination

469
01:06:46.573 --> 01:06:51.213
and we must look to
God for guidance.

470
01:06:58.222 --> 01:06:59.848
Leviticus- 13.

471
01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:03.852
If a man also lie with man.
as he lies with a woman.

472
01:07:03.887 --> 01:07:07.229
both of them have
committed and abomination.

473
01:07:07.264 --> 01:07:09.165
They shall surely
be put to death

474
01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.728
and their blood
shall be upon them.

475
01:07:53.739 --> 01:07:56.674
What can I say to
you good people?

476
01:07:58.711 --> 01:08:01.448
It's right here in
black and white.

477
01:08:04.255 --> 01:08:07.388
Do not dishonor your bodies.

478
01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:12.855
And above all else.
guard your heart

479
01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:17.695
for everything you
do flows from it.

480
01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:26.869
See the tender age at
which the homosexuals

481
01:08:27.707 --> 01:08:28.904
prefer their conquests.

482
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:34.250
We must protect your children

483
01:08:34.285 --> 01:08:39.288
from the lesbians. sadists.
masochists and sexual deviance.

484
01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.918
And we will protect them.

485
01:08:43.954 --> 01:08:46.460
Mark my words.

486
01:08:51.995 --> 01:08:52.928
Natural.

487
01:08:55.339 --> 01:08:56.833
They used to say it's natural.

488
01:08:59.277 --> 01:09:02.476
But they learned a hard lesson.

489
01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:04.412
Didn't they friends.

490
01:09:21.596 --> 01:09:26.434
Because eventually the
river of moral decay ran dry

491
01:09:26.469 --> 01:09:28.931
just like the black
in the ground.

492
01:09:28.966 --> 01:09:31.835
And nature had her revenge

493
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:36.873
and God spoke to
us who could hear.

494
01:10:12.647 --> 01:10:16.880
Yet. even after all this.
we love the abominations.

495
01:10:20.017 --> 01:10:21.819
We do not hate them.

496
01:10:21.854 --> 01:10:24.789
We do what is fair and right

497
01:10:24.824 --> 01:10:27.297
and try to help them
back to the path

498
01:10:27.332 --> 01:10:30.630
because God cannot
love them as they are.

499
01:11:21.518 --> 01:11:22.352
Yes.

500
01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.783
Yes. that's it.

501
01:11:24.818 --> 01:11:27.588
Drink from the blood of Christ.

502
01:11:27.623 --> 01:11:29.425
Let it purify us.

503
01:11:48.809 --> 01:11:50.105
Thank you. daughter.

504
01:11:54.419 --> 01:11:56.353
Revelations.- 7-8.

505
01:11:57.554 --> 01:12:00.148
he who overcomes will
inherit these things

506
01:12:00.183 --> 01:12:04.361
and I will be His God
and he will be my people.

507
01:12:05.089 --> 01:12:06.957
But. for the cowardly

508
01:12:06.992 --> 01:12:10.631
and unbelieving and
abominable and murderers

509
01:12:10.666 --> 01:12:13.502
and immoral persons and
saucerers and idolaters

510
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:17.737
and all liars. their
part will be in the lake

511
01:12:17.772 --> 01:12:22.104
that burns with fire
and brimstone

512
01:12:24.108 --> 01:12:27.615
Which is the second
death.

513
01:15:42.911 --> 01:15:43.745
- Ethan.

514
01:15:49.379 --> 01:15:51.016
Sophie. wait.

515
01:15:51.051 --> 01:15:52.314
- Bea. I'm scared.

516
01:15:52.349 --> 01:15:53.920
- Let him go.

517
01:15:53.955 --> 01:15:55.889
- She wants pure blood.

518
01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:00.894
- No.

519
01:16:25.052 --> 01:16:26.953
Oh. she's coming now.

520
01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:31.793
- Sophie.

521
01:16:47.371 --> 01:16:49.404
Go upstairs and
hide in your room.

522
01:16:49.439 --> 01:16:50.944
- No. I wanna stay with you.

523
01:16:50.979 --> 01:16:51.813
- Go.

524
01:19:20.029 --> 01:19:20.929
- Can I come now?

525
01:19:22.295 --> 01:19:24.867
