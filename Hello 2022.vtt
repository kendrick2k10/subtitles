00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:36.448
And now I feel like
an idiot asking.

182
00:08:36.448 --> 00:08:38.655
which is a feeling I'd like to
go away as soon as possible.

183
00:08:38.655 --> 00:08:39.482
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.137
- Listen. you have said nothing

185
00:08:42.137 --> 00:08:44.172
to make me think
you're an idiot.

186
00:08:44.172 --> 00:08:47.620
I am actually getting flattered.

187
00:08:48.655 --> 00:08:51.862
- So dinner isn't a definite no?

188
00:08:51.862 --> 00:08:53.448
- Yes. It's a no.

189
00:08:53.448 --> 00:08:58.620
but you can kinda categorize
it in your brain as a maybe.

190
00:08:58.862 --> 00:09:01.827
and maybe that'll
make you feel better.

191

mind. here's my number.

- Is something wrong?

201
00:09:26.034 --> 00:09:29.000
- Do you always walk around
with your number on a napkin?

202
00:09:30.172 --> 00:09:31.620
- You've never seen a
business card like this.

and he's from the Bay area.

210
00:10:02.724 --> 00:10:03.689

212
00:10:04.517 --> 00:10:05.862
He asked me on the date.

How did you turn him down?

218

I mean. he's white.

220
00:10:19.689 --> 00:10:21.310
I've never dated a
white guy before.

222
00:10:22.172 --> 00:10:23.310

You're going to hell.

228

229
00:10:42.172 --> 00:10:43.482
and he's not a slave master.

230
00:10:43.482 --> 00:10:45.103
So just let that go.

It is New Year's Eve and
you don't have any plans.

I'm working. you're
gonna be home alone.

Don't do that to yourself.

Just go to dinner with him.

00:17:31.379 --> 00:17:33.000
It is not yours.

359
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
That is Ms. Valentine's
champagne and you
are safeguarding.

360
00:17:38.793 --> 00:17:40.551
But you are doing her a favor.

361
00:17:42.241 --> 00:17:43.827
I mean. it's just one
bottle of champagne.

362
00:17:43.827 --> 00:17:44.827
I mean. she really
gonna miss it.

363
00:17:44.827 --> 00:17:46.310
How would she know?

364
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.068
But just be a
woman of your word.

365
00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:51.275
whatever. whatever I'm
getting the bottle.

366
00:17:52.724 --> 00:17:53.517
Yes.

367
00:18:05.206 --> 00:18:06.034
Pop.

368
00:18:10.275 --> 00:18:11.241
- Okay. Miss V.

369
00:18:12.344 --> 00:18:13.275
That's good.

370
00:18:20.586 --> 00:18:21.413
Yeah.

371
00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:41.793
So Daniel. this is your
business card. right?

372
00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:47.965
Let's see what you're doing.

373
00:18:49.206 --> 00:18:50.965
No. you don't need to
see what you're doing.

374
00:18:55.241 --> 00:18:56.586
Why not?

375
00:18:56.586 --> 00:18:57.448
What will it hurt?

376
00:18:57.448 --> 00:18:58.275
Let's see.

377
00:19:11.448 --> 00:19:12.241
- This is Daniel.

378
00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:15.793
- Hello?

379
00:19:15.793 --> 00:19:17.379
- Hey. Daniel.

00:19:17.379 --> 00:19:18.310
- [Daniel] Yeah.

- Hi. this is Alicia Gregory.

382
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.137
I'm not sure if you
remember who I am.

383
00:19:24.137 --> 00:19:26.310
- Motown girl. hello?

384
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.172
- [Alicia] Yes.
actually that's me.

385
00:19:28.172 --> 00:19:29.068
- What's going on?

386
00:19:30.344 --> 00:19:34.034
- Well. I was wondering if you

387
00:19:34.034 --> 00:19:35.827
still didn't really have
plans for the evening.

388
00:19:35.827 --> 00:19:37.620
- [Daniel] Do you
wanna get a drink?

389
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.275
- I mean. if you
don't have any plans.

390
00:19:40.275 --> 00:19:41.931
- Meet me in
Angelo's in an hour.

391
00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:45.965
- You know Angelo's
is my favorite spot.

392
00:19:45.965 --> 00:19:48.413
- Imagine that. I'll
see you there then.

393
00:19:48.413 --> 00:19:49.241
- All right.

394
00:19:51.758 --> 00:19:53.206
Yes. yes. yes.

395
00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:54.655
She's got a date.

396
00:19:54.655 --> 00:19:56.482
I'm going on a date.

397
00:19:56.482 --> 00:19:58.137
Nicole. you don't know my life.

398
00:19:58.137 --> 00:19:59.275
I'm going on a date.

399
00:19:59.275 --> 00:20:00.241
Thank you very much.

[upbeat music]

401
00:20:06.827 --> 00:20:07.931
- At least you've
got the night off.

402
00:20:07.931 --> 00:20:09.344
What's going on?

403
00:20:09.344 --> 00:20:11.172
- Half dozen. small
dinner parties.

404
00:20:11.172 --> 00:20:13.620
And we got the one big
party at Miss Valentine's.

405

Property management
gonna be up your ass

406
00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:17.620

[upbeat music]

408
00:20:36.896 --> 00:20:40.172
- Hi. I'm so sorry.
but it's New Year's Eve

409
00:20:40.172 --> 00:20:43.206
and you've been waiting for
your guests for a while now

410
00:20:43.206 --> 00:20:45.862
there's a couple that would
love to have this table.

411
00:20:45.862 --> 00:20:49.344
- Oh. oh. okay.

412
00:20:52.172 --> 00:20:54.793
Do I need a date
to sit at the bar?

413
00:20:54.793 --> 00:20:55.620
- No. ma'am.

414
00:20:56.965 --> 00:21:00.896
- Okay. well then
I guess they can have my table

415
00:21:00.896 --> 00:21:01.896
- Thank you.

416
00:21:22.379 --> 00:21:23.724
- Hey.

417
00:21:23.724 --> 00:21:25.551
- I'm leaving. okay.

418
00:21:25.551 --> 00:21:26.517
You're late.

419
00:21:26.517 --> 00:21:27.758
You're over an hour late.

420
00:21:27.758 --> 00:21:29.620
I don't need this
shit in my life.

421
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.862
- Are you gonna throw
me under the bus

422
00:21:30.862 --> 00:21:31.724
without a chance to explain?

423
00:21:31.724 --> 00:21:33.344
- Explain.

424
00:21:33.344 --> 00:21:35.275
There is nothing to explain.

425
00:21:35.275 --> 00:21:37.551
I get it. it's fine.

426
00:21:37.551 --> 00:21:39.482
You got stuff going on.

427
00:21:39.482 --> 00:21:40.344
It's cool.

428
00:21:40.344 --> 00:21:41.551
I don't need it.

429
00:21:41.551 --> 00:21:42.379
- Come on just
lemme talk to you.

430
00:21:42.379 --> 00:21:43.344
- Oh. you wanna talk?

431
00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:44.586
You wanna talk now.

432
00:21:44.586 --> 00:21:46.689
you should have been
here over an hour ago.

433
00:21:46.689 --> 00:21:48.000
- Can you find us a table?

434
00:21:49.206 --> 00:21:50.517
- Do not find us a table.

435
00:21:50.517 --> 00:21:51.862
Thank you.

436
00:21:51.862 --> 00:21:53.034
No thank you 'cause
we're not doing this.

437
00:21:53.034 --> 00:21:54.655
- Where do you
get that attitude?

438
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.448
- Detroit.

439
00:21:57.448 --> 00:21:58.413
- Right. I forgot.

440
00:21:58.413 --> 00:21:59.896
Well. this is L.A.

441
00:21:59.896 --> 00:22:02.448
So you can give the tough
girl act a rest. okay.

442
00:22:02.448 --> 00:22:03.586
- Wait. Okay.

443
00:22:03.586 --> 00:22:04.655
Let me get this straight.

444
00:22:04.655 --> 00:22:06.448
You're over an hour late.

445
00:22:06.448 --> 00:22:07.758
but I'm the one
being unreasonable?

446
00:22:07.758 --> 00:22:08.965
You know what?

447
00:22:08.965 --> 00:22:10.724
I do not like being humiliated.

448
00:22:10.724 --> 00:22:12.241
- Okay. I am sorry.

449
00:22:13.275 --> 00:22:15.068
I can explain. please.

450
00:22:20.241 --> 00:22:21.241
- One.

451
00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:22.034
- Drink

452
00:22:24.793 --> 00:22:25.620
You hungry?

453
00:22:26.793 --> 00:22:27.620
- I ate.

454
00:22:29.241 --> 00:22:31.586
- Could you bring us two
mojitos. a sampler platter.

455
00:22:31.586 --> 00:22:33.172
a couple oyster shooters.

456
00:22:33.172 --> 00:22:34.310
[laughs]

457
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.896
- Now you're ordering. okay.

458
00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:40.896
Look. I know you. I
dated guys like you.

459
00:22:42.068 --> 00:22:45.241
You Daniel. are what I
like to call an asshole

460
00:22:45.241 --> 00:22:47.275
- You're right. I'm an asshole.

461
00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:48.965
But not for the
reason you think.

462
00:22:48.965 --> 00:22:49.758
- Oh really.

463
00:22:51.241 --> 00:22:53.137
- My mom took a turn for
the worst. I got into it.

464
00:22:53.137 --> 00:22:56.068
My stepfather and things
took longer than I thought.

465
00:22:56.068 --> 00:22:58.137
I'm an asshole for not
calling or texting.

466
00:22:58.137 --> 00:23:01.137
but my phone died and
I wanted to change.

467
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.517
I wanted to look nice for you.

468
00:23:04.517 --> 00:23:06.103
- You wanted to
look nice for me?

469
00:23:08.448 --> 00:23:09.827
- Things happen.

470
00:23:09.827 --> 00:23:10.655
I really do.

471
00:23:14.448 --> 00:23:15.896
- How is she?

472
00:23:15.896 --> 00:23:17.448
- She got a little antsy.
had a panic attack.

473
00:23:18.379 --> 00:23:19.793
- That's terrible.

474
00:23:19.793 --> 00:23:20.862
- She's all right.

475
00:23:20.862 --> 00:23:21.965
I don't see her very often.

476
00:23:21.965 --> 00:23:23.620
So when I showed
up she was good.

477
00:23:28.172 --> 00:23:29.137
- You're a good son.

478
00:23:30.068 --> 00:23:30.965
- I try to be.

479
00:23:32.137 --> 00:23:34.000
It's not hard she's
my mom I love her.

480
00:23:36.068 --> 00:23:38.310
- You do know what
they say about sons

481
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.482
who don't want their mother?

482
00:23:40.482 --> 00:23:41.827
- They're assholes?

483
00:23:41.827 --> 00:23:42.793
- Okay. Okay.

484
00:23:42.793 --> 00:23:43.689
You got me on that one.

485
00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:44.551
That was good.

486
00:23:44.551 --> 00:23:45.793
That was cute.

487
00:23:45.793 --> 00:23:47.793
[laughs]

488
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.068
- This is where we do the thing.

489
00:23:57.068 --> 00:23:59.068
If we're both so wonderful.

490
00:23:59.068 --> 00:24:00.862
why are we alone
on New Year's Eve?

491
00:24:03.931 --> 00:24:04.862
- Enlighten me.

492
00:24:04.862 --> 00:24:06.758
- I met a woman. Ayesha.

493
00:24:06.758 --> 00:24:08.241
- Married?

494
00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:09.724
- No. but it was a lot
like a marriage situation.

495
00:24:09.724 --> 00:24:11.448
She had a one year
old when we met

496
00:24:11.448 --> 00:24:13.551
and I raised her daughter.

497
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:16.448
- Oh wow. What's her name?

498
00:24:16.448 --> 00:24:17.275
- Gisele.

499
00:24:18.758 --> 00:24:21.724
Her mom and I were
together for seven years.

500
00:24:21.724 --> 00:24:23.758
- Dare ask what happened?

501
00:24:23.758 --> 00:24:25.517
- She ruined me.

502
00:24:26.689 --> 00:24:27.896
It was over after year two.

503
00:24:27.896 --> 00:24:29.275
but I stayed in it
for another five

504
00:24:29.275 --> 00:24:30.862
because I love Giselle so much.

505
00:24:32.241 --> 00:24:34.206
Just going through the motions.

506
00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:37.448
- That's not a reason to stay
in a relationship though.

507
00:24:37.448 --> 00:24:38.724
- That is true.

508
00:24:38.724 --> 00:24:42.068
But you only know what
you know when you know.

509
00:24:43.206 --> 00:24:46.413
Anyway. mom's
married to a cop now.

510
00:24:46.413 --> 00:24:47.862
- Do you see Gisele. often?

511
00:24:49.379 --> 00:24:53.482
- I wish. but her mom said I
have to meet this cop first

512
00:24:53.482 --> 00:24:54.965
and I didn't have a
problem meeting him.

513
00:24:54.965 --> 00:24:57.344
It's just. she made
it like this mandate.

514
00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:00.758
Gisele's not my
biological daughter.

515
00:25:00.758 --> 00:25:02.758
so I don't have any rights.

516
00:25:02.758 --> 00:25:04.344
I don't have
anybody complain to.

517
00:25:05.448 --> 00:25:06.862
My ego got in the way.

518
00:25:06.862 --> 00:25:09.137
And I felt like I was
asking this cop's permission

519
00:25:09.137 --> 00:25:11.068
to see the child I raised.

520
00:25:14.586 --> 00:25:16.413
You want another drink?

521
00:25:16.413 --> 00:25:17.241
- Thank you.

522
00:25:18.448 --> 00:25:20.448
I did not graduate
from high school.

523
00:25:20.448 --> 00:25:22.620
I didn't even know who I was

524
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:29.620
then I met this guy
and he was great.

525
00:25:30.931 --> 00:25:32.931
Really. really nice guy.

526
00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:35.103
I fell for him out
the gate. I did.

527
00:25:35.103 --> 00:25:36.310
- What did he do?

528
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:40.965
- Oh. like a little of
this. a little of that.

529
00:25:41.586 --> 00:25:42.827
- Narcotics?

530
00:25:42.827 --> 00:25:44.034
- Talk about knowing
something's wrong.

531
00:25:44.034 --> 00:25:46.931
but still doing
it anyway. right?

532
00:25:46.931 --> 00:25:49.103
- We've all been there
one time or another.

533
00:25:49.103 --> 00:25:49.931
- Yeah.

534
00:25:51.275 --> 00:25:56.172
Anyway. he and I.
we we're going good.

535
00:25:57.103 --> 00:25:58.655
Now things are moving fast.

536
00:26:00.137 --> 00:26:02.275
And I must say in the midst
of all that was going on.

537
00:26:02.275 --> 00:26:05.827
he taught me what love is.

538
00:26:07.448 --> 00:26:11.275
Been out of nowhere he
gets popped by the feds

539
00:26:11.275 --> 00:26:14.758
for drug possession eight years.

540
00:26:17.241 --> 00:26:18.931
I was at my own.

541
00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:20.172
I didn't know what to do.

542
00:26:20.172 --> 00:26:21.344
I didn't have anyone to call.

543
00:26:21.344 --> 00:26:23.275
I had no education.

544
00:26:23.275 --> 00:26:25.344
I was almost lost.

545
00:26:25.344 --> 00:26:26.931
- Is he still inside?

546
00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:28.172
- No.

547
00:26:28.172 --> 00:26:33.172
No. he died.

548
00:26:33.172 --> 00:26:36.413
He was killed by a prison riot.

549
00:26:37.931 --> 00:26:41.068
So I guess I should ask this
the correct way this time.

550
00:26:41.068 --> 00:26:43.827
What is it that you
do for a living?

551
00:26:43.827 --> 00:26:44.827
- Arbitrage.

552
00:26:46.827 --> 00:26:48.344
- Arbitrage?

553
00:26:48.344 --> 00:26:49.862
- You know what that is?

554
00:26:49.862 --> 00:26:54.379
- Kinda like. is that where
you sell and buy money?

555
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.344
- Pretty much.

556
00:26:57.034 --> 00:27:00.620
I take advantage of
the instability of
two or more markets

557
00:27:01.862 --> 00:27:04.413
combinations of deals
are made to capitalize

558
00:27:04.413 --> 00:27:05.827
in the imbalance.

559
00:27:05.827 --> 00:27:08.448
the profit being the difference
between the market prices.

560
00:27:11.965 --> 00:27:12.793
- I'm sorry.

561
00:27:12.793 --> 00:27:13.620
I'm trying.

562
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.793
I have no idea.

563
00:27:14.793 --> 00:27:16.275
I have no idea
what you just said.

564
00:27:16.275 --> 00:27:17.241
- Either do I.

[Alicia laughs]

566
00:27:20.448 --> 00:27:21.241

567
00:27:27.068 --> 00:27:29.241
- You wanna get outta here?

568
00:27:30.724 --> 00:27:32.482
- I feel like this is the moment

569
00:27:32.482 --> 00:27:36.241
where two people that want
healthy relationships.

570
00:27:36.241 --> 00:27:39.379
I feel like this is the
moment that they try to avoid.

571
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.965
- It's New Year's Eve.

572
00:27:42.965 --> 00:27:44.793
No one's looking for
a healthy relationship

573

they just looking
for a good time.

You're right. you're right.

Hey. Rigo.

- It's a police
convention in here.

- Yeah. My neighbors having
a New Year's Eve party.

So this is what happens when
all your friends are cops.

- I can't imagine
that's gonna be any fun.

591
00:28:44.655 --> 00:28:46.000
- Well tonight's talent night

592
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.103
so law enforcement is
here in full force.

wanna warn you now.

me into collecting.

take in your vodka?

- Ice.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.448
- Okay.

610
00:29:48.448 --> 00:29:50.206
Just ice.

going on upstairs.

this party every year.

know so many cops?

on the police force. LAPD
so that's most likely why.

like cops. right?

- Why? Because of Gisele.

fabulous night despite them.

What is in that?

- It is a vanilla vodka
and a pomegranate lemonade.

clothes really fast?

glad those days are over.

have been on the list.

of bullshit but I am full.

would you do that?

talking about finding someone.

help getting back out there.

- I don't need help.

- And I knew you
two used to date.

708

- That's exactly why
he wasn't invited.

So you want me to
go kick him him out?

I will.

713
00:35:33.068 --> 00:35:35.275
- That could be a problem.

714

Thing is how everybody in here
works for him. including you.

- That is true.

time. leave him alone.

717
00:35:46.068 --> 00:35:48.344
- Make sure I ruin that
before the evening's over.

718
00:35:49.758 --> 00:35:50.931
Auntie behave.

719
00:35:52.379 --> 00:35:54.862
[upbeat music]

720
00:37:05.103 --> 00:37:06.275
- This is good.

721
00:37:06.275 --> 00:37:07.068
It's really good.

722
00:37:08.241 --> 00:37:10.517
But I have to admit
it is tarnished

723
00:37:10.517 --> 00:37:12.758
my girl next door
perception of you.

724
00:37:12.758 --> 00:37:14.551
It calls your
character into question

725
00:37:14.551 --> 00:37:18.000
and this whole innocent
thing you've got going on.

726
00:37:20.068 --> 00:37:21.517
- Why are you doing this?

727
00:37:21.517 --> 00:37:23.793
- You're a flight attendant
and you fly the plane.

728
00:37:23.793 --> 00:37:26.068
but you're responsible
for the passengers on it.

729
00:37:26.068 --> 00:37:28.689
It's not like crack or heroine.

730
00:37:28.689 --> 00:37:31.310
It has to impede your
judgment in some way.

731
00:37:32.758 --> 00:37:35.931
not to mention you have like
five cases of champagne.

732
00:37:35.931 --> 00:37:38.758
the good stuff. but you
didn't offer me any.

733
00:37:38.758 --> 00:37:40.793
Again. it goes to character.

734
00:37:40.793 --> 00:37:44.344
If you're capable of that.
what else are you capable of?

735
00:37:47.551 --> 00:37:48.517
- Did you hit me?

736
00:37:50.482 --> 00:37:51.931
- Yeah.

737
00:37:51.931 --> 00:37:53.275
As a rule. I don't hit women

738
00:37:53.275 --> 00:37:56.034
because my dad used
to smack my mom around

739
00:37:56.034 --> 00:37:57.241
when I was a kid.

740
00:37:57.241 --> 00:38:00.000
Obviously I made an
extreme exception here.

741
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.344
I used my forearms.

742
00:38:01.344 --> 00:38:03.931
So it would land flush
to not make a bruise.

743
00:38:03.931 --> 00:38:05.896
but you can never really tell.

744
00:38:05.896 --> 00:38:07.551
This is not an exact science.

745
00:38:10.724 --> 00:38:12.758
No. no bruise.

746
00:38:12.758 --> 00:38:15.758
- Help. help.

747
00:38:19.068 --> 00:38:20.517
- I am being patient

748
00:38:20.517 --> 00:38:22.758
but you're gonna have to
cancel that shit right now.

749
00:38:23.931 --> 00:38:24.758
Just relax.

750
00:38:25.586 --> 00:38:28.551
Let it melt. swallow.

751
00:38:32.655 --> 00:38:35.931
No one can hear you anyway.
not with Miss Valentine's party.

752
00:38:38.724 --> 00:38:39.965
- What are you gonna do?

753
00:38:39.965 --> 00:38:41.275
Are you gonna rape me?

754
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:43.379
- Seriously?

755
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.586
If you recall. we
were moments away

756
00:38:46.586 --> 00:38:50.793
from the emotional throws of
carpet burn. head-banging sex.

757
00:38:50.793 --> 00:38:52.862
I have to admit it was tempting.

758
00:38:52.862 --> 00:38:55.034
Well. you traipsed out
here looking so sexy.

759
00:38:56.413 --> 00:38:57.655
I could have married
you then and there.

760
00:38:57.655 --> 00:38:59.275
but that is not
part of the plan.

761
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:04.206
- You planned this?

762
00:39:04.206 --> 00:39:05.137
- You think I didn't.

763
00:39:05.137 --> 00:39:06.344
- You couldn't have planned this

764
00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:09.896
because I met you by
accident on the airplane

765
00:39:09.896 --> 00:39:12.724
and you were late
to the restaurant.

766
00:39:12.724 --> 00:39:16.275
So had I left then none of
this would even be happening.

767
00:39:17.206 --> 00:39:19.103
- I was right up the block.

768
00:39:19.103 --> 00:39:21.689
See. I had scored major cool
points with you on the plane.

769
00:39:21.689 --> 00:39:24.172
If I show up on time.
it's too good to be true.

770
00:39:24.172 --> 00:39:26.620
Conflict breeds passion.

771
00:39:28.068 --> 00:39:30.689
I created enough drama to
get you angry and drinking.

772
00:39:30.689 --> 00:39:33.517
Draw off your judgment
story about my mom

773
00:39:33.517 --> 00:39:35.172
made you think you
could trust me.

774
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:38.724
- So your mother
isn't in the hospital?

775
00:39:38.724 --> 00:39:40.689
- My mother died eight years ago

776
00:39:42.965 --> 00:39:44.172
I'm not just a bad date.

777
00:39:46.724 --> 00:39:48.448
I'm a bad everything.

778
00:39:49.586 --> 00:39:52.034
- [Nicole] The captain has
turned off the seatbelt sign.

779
00:39:52.034 --> 00:39:54.034
Please feel free to
move about the cabin.

780
00:39:59.034 --> 00:40:00.482
- Do you think that they'll
cancel our next flight

781
00:40:00.482 --> 00:40:02.379
because of that storm?

782
00:40:02.379 --> 00:40:03.379
- One can only hope.

783
00:40:05.827 --> 00:40:07.724
- If that joker rings
his bell one more time

784
00:40:07.724 --> 00:40:08.655
I'm going to kill him.

785
00:40:08.655 --> 00:40:11.137
- I wouldn't go that far.

786
00:40:11.137 --> 00:40:13.137
- I'll piss in the
next drink he orders.

787
00:40:13.137 --> 00:40:14.965
- I'm surprised there isn't
a video out of that by now

788
00:40:14.965 --> 00:40:16.793
- It could be my film debut.

789
00:40:18.137 --> 00:40:19.482
- And then you can
get the airline sued

790
00:40:19.482 --> 00:40:21.482
for millions of dollars
to lose your job

791
00:40:21.482 --> 00:40:23.310
and end up living
alone with a cat.

792
00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:25.517
- Well. this is an area where

793
00:40:25.517 --> 00:40:27.827
I probably want as
much cover as possible.

794
00:40:27.827 --> 00:40:30.137
- Then get somebody
else to do it.

795
00:40:30.137 --> 00:40:30.965
- For real?

796
00:40:33.241 --> 00:40:34.172
- Look at my face.

797
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.482
- Hey. hey. this is some
kind of joke. right?

798
00:40:43.482 --> 00:40:46.310
I mean. okay. for a
TV show or something?

799
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.413
- Running out of items on your.

800
00:40:47.413 --> 00:40:49.034
what the hell is going on list?

801
00:40:50.724 --> 00:40:53.689
- Look. this side of you is
not gonna help you get girls.

802
00:40:53.689 --> 00:40:54.862
- I do all right.

803
00:40:54.862 --> 00:40:56.551
- Why are you
doing this. Daniel?

804
00:40:59.068 --> 00:41:01.103
- My name isn't Daniel.

805
00:41:01.103 --> 00:41:02.517
but for the purposes
of our relationship.

806
00:41:02.517 --> 00:41:03.689
let's keep that going.

807
00:41:03.689 --> 00:41:05.793
This is a nice bag

808
00:41:05.793 --> 00:41:06.620
What's it cost?

809
00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.586
Couple grand?

810
00:41:07.586 --> 00:41:09.413
- I don't know it was a gift.

811
00:41:09.413 --> 00:41:12.379
- By the way. what is
with all the champagne.

812
00:41:12.379 --> 00:41:13.517
- I like to party.

813
00:41:14.448 --> 00:41:15.724
- I bet.

814
00:41:15.724 --> 00:41:16.620
Well. let's see
what we've got here.

815
00:41:23.448 --> 00:41:25.034
Oh. little lady. big gun.

816
00:41:25.034 --> 00:41:27.034
What do we have here?

817
00:41:27.034 --> 00:41:30.689
Smith & Wesson 38
titanium revolver.

818
00:41:30.689 --> 00:41:32.241
Nice. expensive.

819
00:41:32.241 --> 00:41:34.517
- My roommate gave and
sent me for protection.

820
00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.172
- How's that
working out for you?

821
00:41:38.137 --> 00:41:38.931
- Rewind.

822
00:41:41.551 --> 00:41:43.689
I'm gonna hang onto this
with my own protection.

823
00:41:52.655 --> 00:41:54.862
So much better since
they improved the camera.

824
00:41:55.862 --> 00:41:57.551
Say cheese.

825
00:41:57.551 --> 00:42:02.172
No? you know I always wanted
to be a photographer.

826
00:42:02.172 --> 00:42:03.655
Photographers get all the women.

827
00:42:03.655 --> 00:42:06.206
There is almost nothing
you can't get a woman to do

828
00:42:06.206 --> 00:42:08.068
if you've got a
camera in your hands.

829
00:42:13.689 --> 00:42:15.448
That could be your
new pic for the gram.

830
00:42:15.448 --> 00:42:17.344
You know. it's amazing to me.

831
00:42:17.344 --> 00:42:20.275
how many women claiming to
be into the Lord or whatever.

832
00:42:20.275 --> 00:42:23.310
and have half naked pictures
of themselves on their pages.

833
00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.137
I get it.

834
00:42:24.137 --> 00:42:25.379
It's not complicated.

835
00:42:25.379 --> 00:42:27.310
Women like attention
and the regular photos

836
00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:29.793
don't get as many likes
as the butt naked one.

837
00:42:29.793 --> 00:42:32.793
So even the most
conservative prudent women

838
00:42:32.793 --> 00:42:35.103
will post a pick from the
beach wearing a bikini.

839
00:42:35.103 --> 00:42:38.000
which is really just
a bra and panties.

840
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.689
Check out my hot ass that
I'm showing you accidentally

841
00:42:40.689 --> 00:42:42.103
on purpose.

842
00:42:42.103 --> 00:42:44.275
Like me. love me. comment.

843
00:42:44.275 --> 00:42:45.172
Tell me I'm hot.

844
00:42:45.172 --> 00:42:47.620
They all live.

845
00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.620
And their little
narcissistic side shows

846
00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.172
laced with a bit of hypocrisy.

847
00:42:54.448 --> 00:42:55.586
- That's not all women.

848
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.620
- No. just 99%.

849
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.206
Don't get me started
on sex tapes.

850
00:43:02.206 --> 00:43:06.000
I mean. who loses a video of
them riding the high hard one?

851
00:43:07.413 --> 00:43:09.034
Maybe we should
live stream this.

852
00:43:10.551 --> 00:43:11.379
- We should.

853
00:43:12.931 --> 00:43:16.275
There are a lot of people
that are into bondage.

854
00:43:16.275 --> 00:43:17.034
- The police.

855
00:43:18.103 --> 00:43:18.931
Nice try.

856
00:43:20.344 --> 00:43:25.000
Anyway. let's get back to
the virtuous. Alicia Gregory.

857
00:43:25.862 --> 00:43:27.000
You know. it's funny.

858
00:43:28.448 --> 00:43:31.655
it's New Year's Eve and you
have not gotten one call.

859
00:43:32.724 --> 00:43:35.206
not one person wishing you well.

860
00:43:35.206 --> 00:43:37.137
No one even ask you out. but me.

861
00:43:40.379 --> 00:43:41.551
- Should have got a cat.

862
00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:43.896
- I know much care for cats.

863
00:43:43.896 --> 00:43:45.379
More of a dog person.

864
00:43:45.379 --> 00:43:47.724
a dog will protect its owner
with no rhyme or reason.

865
00:43:51.689 --> 00:43:53.379
- How long are we gonna do this?

866
00:43:53.379 --> 00:43:58.344
- Gum. lipstick. makeup remover.

867
00:44:00.206 --> 00:44:03.758
Q-tips. lotion. M&Ms.

868
00:44:04.137 --> 00:44:07.068
- Look you did all of this
just to go through my purse?

869
00:44:07.068 --> 00:44:09.965
- Dramamine. what kind
of flight attendant

870
00:44:09.965 --> 00:44:11.655
gets motion sickness?

871
00:44:11.655 --> 00:44:15.413
- You try going up and down
30.000 feet several times a day

872
00:44:15.413 --> 00:44:16.379
tell me how you feel?

873
00:44:17.586 --> 00:44:19.551
- Minus the 30.000 feet
sound like a hooker.

874
00:44:23.965 --> 00:44:25.448
Most people take
terrible pictures

875
00:44:25.448 --> 00:44:26.758
on their driver's license.

876
00:44:26.758 --> 00:44:29.448
I'm one of them. but
this is really good.

877
00:44:29.448 --> 00:44:31.413
- Look. if it's
money that you want.

878
00:44:31.413 --> 00:44:33.103
then just take my purse.

879
00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:34.275
Okay. you can sell it.

880
00:44:35.482 --> 00:44:38.689
I have at least
$160 in my wallet

881
00:44:38.689 --> 00:44:40.965
and I know I have
$200 on my nightstand.

882
00:44:40.965 --> 00:44:44.758
- I already found the
200 along with this.

883
00:44:51.517 --> 00:44:53.586
I guess your nights have
been a little lonelier

884
00:44:53.586 --> 00:44:54.551
than I thought.

885
00:44:55.689 --> 00:44:56.896
- I should have
kept them that way.

886
00:44:56.896 --> 00:44:59.413
- Well. all those years
watching Cinderella

887
00:44:59.413 --> 00:45:02.379
growing up can really throw
off a girl's judgment.

888
00:45:04.655 --> 00:45:07.482
- Why are you doing this
you sick fucking bastard?

889
00:45:08.827 --> 00:45:12.172
- I've been drinking
champagne. vodka. smoking weed.

890
00:45:12.172 --> 00:45:13.965
drunk and high at the same time.

891
00:45:13.965 --> 00:45:17.172
and you're testing my patience

892
00:45:17.172 --> 00:45:18.000
Stop it.

893
00:45:21.137 --> 00:45:21.965
Good.

894
00:45:27.379 --> 00:45:29.275
Oh. I get the munchies.

895
00:45:41.793 --> 00:45:42.862
- Chief Collins.

896
00:45:43.724 --> 00:45:44.689
- Miss Valentine.

897
00:45:45.896 --> 00:45:47.379
- I'm empty. would you be a dear

898
00:45:47.379 --> 00:45:49.000
and get me another champagne.

899
00:45:50.551 --> 00:45:52.965
This is a police
friendly environment

900
00:45:52.965 --> 00:45:55.000
and I hate to interrupt
your schooling

901
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.827
of the younger generation.
but we need to talk.

902
00:45:58.827 --> 00:46:00.965
- Do we have to?

903
00:46:00.965 --> 00:46:02.689
- My house. my rules.

904
00:46:05.034 --> 00:46:06.896
- You are killing
in that outfit.

905
00:46:08.413 --> 00:46:09.896
- It's a disguise.

906
00:46:09.896 --> 00:46:11.068
- Yeah. as what?

907
00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:12.689
- Someone who invited
you to my party.

908
00:46:12.689 --> 00:46:15.241
- Of course I should be.

909
00:46:15.241 --> 00:46:18.551
- Is that your solution
to everything. running?

910
00:46:18.551 --> 00:46:20.379
- Well. you should stop
being so mad at me.

911
00:46:20.379 --> 00:46:24.896
- I had just found out
I was pregnant by a man

912
00:46:24.896 --> 00:46:27.551
who was going through
a nasty divorce

913
00:46:27.551 --> 00:46:31.620
and whom I happened to
work for so excuse me

914
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.206
if I needed to clear my head.

915
00:46:34.586 --> 00:46:37.103
- How do you think I
felt going through it

916
00:46:37.103 --> 00:46:39.413
while being suspended
for fraternizing

917
00:46:39.413 --> 00:46:41.206
with a subordinate officer.

918
00:46:41.206 --> 00:46:43.931
- I thought Linda was a friend

919
00:46:43.931 --> 00:46:47.068
I had no idea she'd
tell the world.

920
00:46:47.068 --> 00:46:49.344
- She was a bullhorn
and you knew it.

921
00:46:50.551 --> 00:46:53.965
- You think I told her
to hurt your career?

922
00:46:53.965 --> 00:46:55.931
- Think you told her to hurt me.

923
00:47:02.862 --> 00:47:04.862
- Thank you. sweetheart.

924
00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.275
- I dig this cranberry tuna.

925
00:47:17.275 --> 00:47:18.931
costs about $20 a quart.

926
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.448
Must be nice to afford this
small luxuries in life.

927
00:47:22.448 --> 00:47:24.620
Of course women will
buy anything they think

928
00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:27.862
will help 'em lose weight.
tuna juice. salad. whatever.

929
00:47:29.793 --> 00:47:31.620
- It is amazing that
a group of women

930
00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.620
have not beat your ass yet.

931
00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.275
- Many have tried
it yet here I am.

932
00:47:38.103 --> 00:47:40.379
I've got something you
want. your life and freedom.

933
00:47:40.379 --> 00:47:42.034
You've got something I want.

934
00:47:42.034 --> 00:47:43.448
I'm your host.
you're the hostage.

935
00:47:43.448 --> 00:47:44.758
let's play our game.

936
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:48.137
- Where are the diamonds?

937
00:47:49.034 --> 00:47:49.862
- Huh?

938
00:47:51.827 --> 00:47:53.517
- Where are the diamonds?

939
00:47:53.517 --> 00:47:55.137
- What are you talking about?

940
00:47:55.137 --> 00:47:57.862
- Where are the diamonds?

941
00:47:57.862 --> 00:47:59.965
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

942
00:48:03.448 --> 00:48:06.000
- I was in prison with your
boyfriend. Troy Nelson.

943
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
- Well. if this has
anything to do with Troy.

944
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.137
then I don't know what
you're talking about.

945
00:48:11.172 --> 00:48:14.034
Look. Troy's dead. okay?

946
00:48:14.034 --> 00:48:17.103
And before that he was in
prison for three years.

947
00:48:17.103 --> 00:48:19.103
- Yes. a real loss
to the planet earth.

948
00:48:19.103 --> 00:48:21.413
But before Soul
Train met his demise-

949
00:48:21.413 --> 00:48:23.586
- Who the hell is Soul Train?

950
00:48:23.586 --> 00:48:26.000
- Troy Nelson also
known as Soul Train.

951
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.517
And it's not because
he could dance

952
00:48:27.517 --> 00:48:29.482
it's because he was black
and had a prosperous career

953
00:48:29.482 --> 00:48:30.793
as a drug dealer.

954
00:48:30.793 --> 00:48:32.413
shuttling product
from Mexico to LA.

955
00:48:32.413 --> 00:48:35.862
- I already told you.
Troy was a drug dealer.

956
00:48:35.862 --> 00:48:37.517
- Let's keep that
circle of truth going.

957
00:48:37.517 --> 00:48:39.344
And you can start by telling me

958
00:48:39.344 --> 00:48:43.344
where the 2.7 million
dollars in diamonds that
Troy Nelson was paid

959
00:48:43.344 --> 00:48:46.827
for his final transaction in
pharmaceutical distribution.

960
00:48:46.827 --> 00:48:48.517
- $2 Million in diamonds?

961
00:48:48.517 --> 00:48:50.103
- Don't act surprised.

962
00:48:50.103 --> 00:48:53.172
- You think that
I have $2 million.

963
00:48:53.172 --> 00:48:55.000
but you don't want
me to act surprised.

964
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.172
- 2.7 million and do not
act like you don't know

965
00:48:57.172 --> 00:48:58.275
what I'm talking about.

966
00:48:58.275 --> 00:48:59.517
I have done a careful search.

967
00:48:59.517 --> 00:49:01.586
I've tried not to
break anything.

968
00:49:01.586 --> 00:49:03.413
but I have not
found the diamonds.

969
00:49:03.413 --> 00:49:04.931
- I'm sure you haven't

970
00:49:04.931 --> 00:49:07.275
and you will not find them
because they are not here.

971
00:49:07.275 --> 00:49:10.206
Listen. I would help you.
okay if I could. but I can't.

972
00:49:11.689 --> 00:49:16.068
I have not seen or spoken to
Troy since he went to prison.

973
00:49:16.068 --> 00:49:17.896
- Oh. there goes
our circle of truth.

974
00:49:20.896 --> 00:49:23.586
You're being naive at best.

975
00:49:23.586 --> 00:49:26.034
and disingenuous
at the very worse.

976
00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:30.068
- Did you just call
me a dumb liar?

977
00:49:31.758 --> 00:49:32.586
- Yeah.

978
00:49:34.241 --> 00:49:36.034
- I hope you rot on
your way to hell.

979
00:49:38.413 --> 00:49:39.241
- Okay.

980
00:49:49.517 --> 00:49:51.965
If you haven't seen Troy.
since he got locked up

981
00:49:51.965 --> 00:49:53.137
explain these.

982
00:49:53.137 --> 00:49:54.620
- They're letters.

983
00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.931
He wrote me.

984
00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:57.310
I didn't write him.

985
00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:58.586
- That's kind of stupid

986
00:49:58.586 --> 00:50:00.827
to keep writing someone
who isn't writing back.

987
00:50:00.827 --> 00:50:01.965
Even for a convict.

988
00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:05.931
- I told you I cared about him.

989
00:50:05.931 --> 00:50:07.862
- Well. that's not what
you said at the restaurant.

990
00:50:07.862 --> 00:50:09.931
I was drinking. but
I wasn't so far gone

991
00:50:09.931 --> 00:50:12.000
that I don't remember
you saying you loved him.

992
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.931
- I wasn't-

993
00:50:12.931 --> 00:50:14.620
- He was a real nice guy.

994
00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:16.689
Lots of money. great lifestyle.

995
00:50:16.689 --> 00:50:18.103
Y'all did a lot
of stuff together.

996
00:50:18.103 --> 00:50:19.724
- I know what I said.

997
00:50:19.724 --> 00:50:21.620
- And why lie about it now?

998
00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.137
- Look. Troy was my man. okay.

999
00:50:26.172 --> 00:50:28.965
He was good to me
and he helped me.

1000
00:50:30.172 --> 00:50:33.206
I was just trying to
respect his memory.

1001
00:50:35.103 --> 00:50:37.551
- I admire your courage.
if not your loyalty.

1002
00:50:39.103 --> 00:50:42.034
but if you don't want to die.
you need to tell me the truth.

1003
00:50:43.551 --> 00:50:44.965
"Dear. honey."

1004
00:50:44.965 --> 00:50:46.172
That would be you.

1005
00:50:46.172 --> 00:50:47.724
- Stop. I know what
the letter says.

1006
00:50:47.724 --> 00:50:49.482
- I am sure you do. but I don't.

1007
00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:52.034
"It's tough in here. babe."

1008
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:54.241
I guess he should
have thought of that

1009
00:50:54.241 --> 00:50:56.517
before he became a drug dealer.

1010
00:50:56.517 --> 00:50:58.827
but Troy was not
particularly bright. was he?

1011
00:50:58.827 --> 00:51:01.172
- Really. moral superiority
coming from a man

1012
00:51:01.172 --> 00:51:02.758
who was also in prison?

1013
00:51:02.758 --> 00:51:04.896
- "You're the first thing
I think of every morning

1014
00:51:04.896 --> 00:51:07.551
and the last thing I
think of at night."

1015
00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:09.310
But how much did
you think about him

1016
00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:10.793
when there was
another guy up in here

1017
00:51:10.793 --> 00:51:12.413
giving you the high hard one?

1018
00:51:12.413 --> 00:51:14.172
- I never cheated on Troy.

1019
00:51:14.172 --> 00:51:16.482
Not once. Not once.

1020
00:51:16.482 --> 00:51:19.344
- Unless you count our little
battery operated friend.

1021
00:51:21.379 --> 00:51:22.344
Okay. here we go.

1022
00:51:23.827 --> 00:51:26.793
"Thanks for the money
you put on my books.

1023
00:51:26.793 --> 00:51:28.724
Be careful how much you send.

1024
00:51:28.724 --> 00:51:31.655
I don't want people
to get suspicious.

1025
00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:35.137
Love always. Troy."

1026
00:51:35.137 --> 00:51:36.482
People get suspicious.

1027
00:51:36.482 --> 00:51:38.000
I wonder what he meant by that.

1028
00:51:40.172 --> 00:51:42.137
- He didn't want me putting
too much money on his books

1029
00:51:42.137 --> 00:51:45.655
because they would apply it
to the cost of his trial.

1030
00:51:45.655 --> 00:51:48.034
- Why would you think
you have too much money?

1031
00:51:48.034 --> 00:51:49.310
I mean. I don't even
think Jeff Bezos

1032
00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:51.586
thinks there's such
thing as too much money.

1033
00:51:51.586 --> 00:51:54.793
And even if there was.
where did you get it?

1034
00:51:54.793 --> 00:51:55.620
- I work.

1035
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.689
Look. it was tight at times.

1036
00:51:59.689 --> 00:52:01.344
Yes. but I figured it out.

1037
00:52:02.793 --> 00:52:05.310
Look. I didn't visit him.

1038
00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:06.689
And it was the guilt.

1039
00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:10.586
But see. that's something that

1040
00:52:10.586 --> 00:52:12.448
you obviously know nothing about

1041
00:52:12.448 --> 00:52:16.482
considering you let
your ego keep you away

1042
00:52:16.482 --> 00:52:21.034
from your so-called
daughter. Gisele.

1043
00:52:23.724 --> 00:52:26.379
- You make a great candidate
for a talk show host.

1044
00:52:26.379 --> 00:52:31.344
- But maybe. I'm thinking now
maybe there is no daughter.

1045
00:52:32.241 --> 00:52:34.413
Maybe there is no Gisele.

1046
00:52:34.413 --> 00:52:36.206
Maybe you lied about that.

1047
00:52:36.206 --> 00:52:38.724
Yeah. you lied about your name.

1048
00:52:38.724 --> 00:52:41.206
You lied about your mother.

1049
00:52:41.206 --> 00:52:42.413
So maybe that's it.

1050
00:52:42.413 --> 00:52:45.068
Maybe it's all a lie
because I cannot imagine

1051
00:52:45.068 --> 00:52:48.551
if you really did
raise this daughter.

1052
00:52:48.551 --> 00:52:51.103
how you could be
doing this to a woman.

1053
00:52:51.103 --> 00:52:53.758
- You don't get to
talk about Gisele.

1054
00:52:53.758 --> 00:52:56.931
- I'm not talking about
Gisele I'm talking about you.

1055
00:52:56.931 --> 00:53:00.206
See if my man raised my daughter

1056
00:53:00.206 --> 00:53:05.241
the way you say you raised
her. kind and gentle-

1057
00:53:05.965 --> 00:53:06.620
- Shut your mouth.

1058
00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:07.689
- Okay. Got it.

1059
00:53:08.862 --> 00:53:10.310
You aren't gentle.

1060
00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:12.586
You aren't kind. you weren't
none of those things.

1061
00:53:12.586 --> 00:53:15.655
You are a junkie.

1062
00:53:15.655 --> 00:53:16.793
You're an alcoholic.

1063
00:53:18.413 --> 00:53:20.103
Is that it?

1064
00:53:20.103 --> 00:53:21.344
Is that why Ayesha left you.

1065
00:53:21.344 --> 00:53:22.448
She was afraid of you.

1066
00:53:23.896 --> 00:53:27.758
She most likely went to the cop
to protect herself from you.

1067
00:53:27.758 --> 00:53:30.620
to protect Gisele from you.

1068
00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:32.448
She was scared of you.

1069
00:53:32.448 --> 00:53:34.896
I feel like I'm getting
somewhere closer now.

1070
00:53:34.896 --> 00:53:37.103
I mean. you know so much
about my life. Daniel.

1071
00:53:37.103 --> 00:53:39.586
Why not. tell me please.

1072
00:53:43.793 --> 00:53:46.517
- My name is not Daniel.

1073
00:53:46.517 --> 00:53:48.793
- I know it's not Daniel.

1074
00:53:48.793 --> 00:53:51.482
And you're would you say a
marriage type of situation?

1075
00:53:51.482 --> 00:53:52.448
Is that what it was?

1076
00:53:55.034 --> 00:53:56.689
- You got a gang of words
coming outta your mouth.

1077
00:53:56.689 --> 00:53:58.793
but you're not saying a thing.

1078
00:53:58.793 --> 00:54:00.793
Why
is it always the man's fault?

1079
00:54:00.793 --> 00:54:03.241
It's the easiest thing
in the world for a woman

1080
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:06.689
to blame a man for
her overwhelmingly
dimwitted decisions.

1081
00:54:06.689 --> 00:54:09.000
maybe Ayesha was so disgusted

1082
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.896
with what she did
in our relationship.

1083
00:54:10.896 --> 00:54:12.068
she couldn't look
herself in the mirror

1084
00:54:12.068 --> 00:54:13.379
and so she ran into a cop

1085
00:54:13.379 --> 00:54:15.862
'cause that was the
closest thing to right.

1086
00:54:15.862 --> 00:54:19.586
Like the whore who
became a bible thumping.

1087
00:54:19.586 --> 00:54:21.103
doorbell ringing fanatic.

1088
00:54:21.103 --> 00:54:24.103
after she got gang-banged by
the varsity football team.

1089
00:54:24.103 --> 00:54:27.103
As if going into a room
of drunk horny teenage boys

1090
00:54:27.103 --> 00:54:29.689
to strip for money wasn't
a sign that something bad

1091
00:54:29.689 --> 00:54:30.517
might happen.

1092
00:54:32.827 --> 00:54:34.448
Or maybe she was a
born again idiot.

1093
00:54:34.448 --> 00:54:36.379
too stupid to graduate
from high school.

1094
00:54:36.379 --> 00:54:40.172
didn't know who she is.
going with the flow.

1095
00:54:40.172 --> 00:54:41.862
living in the moment.

1096
00:54:41.862 --> 00:54:43.724
which all of a sudden
makes dating a drug dealer

1097
00:54:43.724 --> 00:54:45.000
something cool to do.

1098
00:54:59.172 --> 00:55:01.620
-Dixie cup size of peach cobbler

1099
00:55:02.241 --> 00:55:03.827
- Great job.

1100
00:55:03.827 --> 00:55:05.586
Always leave them
beggin for more

1101
00:55:07.827 --> 00:55:09.379
- What are you doing?

1102
00:55:09.379 --> 00:55:10.724
- Sorry?

1103
00:55:10.724 --> 00:55:12.000
- Where are you going?

1104
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.655
- I've done an adequate
amount of glad-handing.

1105
00:55:13.655 --> 00:55:16.344
and I know you
don't want me here.

1106
00:55:16.344 --> 00:55:19.068
so I'm leaving to avoid
any embarrassment.

1107
00:55:19.068 --> 00:55:19.896
- No you're not.

1108
00:55:19.896 --> 00:55:20.724
- Auntie.

1109
00:55:20.724 --> 00:55:21.758
- Steven.

1110
00:55:21.758 --> 00:55:23.517
- Pardon me.

1111
00:55:23.517 --> 00:55:25.724
- We are almost outta champagne.

1112
00:55:25.724 --> 00:55:27.068
- Did you drink all of it?

1113
00:55:28.241 --> 00:55:30.310
- Try as I might.

1114
00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:31.413
I cannot not.

1115
00:55:31.413 --> 00:55:33.103
- Are you drunk?

1116
00:55:33.103 --> 00:55:37.379
- Buzzed. flying to
just the right speed.

1117
00:55:38.551 --> 00:55:40.000
- Okay.

1118
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.275
Go find a hand truck

1119
00:55:41.275 --> 00:55:44.068
and get the rest of the
champagne from Alicia's.

1120
00:55:44.068 --> 00:55:44.896
- I'll handle it.

1121
00:55:47.241 --> 00:55:48.275
- Do you like movies?

1122
00:55:49.137 --> 00:55:50.172
I like movies.

1123
00:55:50.172 --> 00:55:52.310
I especially like scary movies

1124
00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:54.034
I know none of it's real.

1125
00:55:54.034 --> 00:55:57.482
but what I enjoy about them
is that they could be real.

1126
00:55:57.482 --> 00:55:59.103
It could happen.

1127
00:55:59.103 --> 00:56:00.620
And the reason we believe
it could happen is because

1128
00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:04.689
these movies have something
called the ring of truth.

1129
00:56:04.689 --> 00:56:06.172
Now you're talking.

1130
00:56:06.172 --> 00:56:09.379
but everything you're saying
lacks the ring of truth.

1131
00:56:09.379 --> 00:56:13.517
For instance. if I had your
social security number and I do.

1132
00:56:13.517 --> 00:56:14.896
I could check your credit online

1133
00:56:14.896 --> 00:56:16.310
and see that you
haven't missed a payment

1134
00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:18.379
on your loft in six years.

1135
00:56:18.379 --> 00:56:21.034
you've got a credit
rating of 790.

1136
00:56:21.034 --> 00:56:22.896
but I'm sure you
already knew that.

1137
00:56:22.896 --> 00:56:26.379
Troy bought this place. but
the mortgage isn't cheap.

1138
00:56:26.379 --> 00:56:29.482
The flight attendant salaries
based on a number of things.

1139
00:56:29.482 --> 00:56:32.655
education. years of
experience. location.

1140
00:56:32.655 --> 00:56:34.482
So on and so forth.

1141
00:56:34.482 --> 00:56:39.448
You bring in $76.531 a
year. that's before taxes.

1142
00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:41.965
So let's knock that down to 55

1143
00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:43.724
after the government
takes their cut.

1144
00:56:43.724 --> 00:56:46.862
The mortgage on this place
is five grand a month.

1145
00:56:46.862 --> 00:56:48.689
That's 60 a year.

1146
00:56:48.689 --> 00:56:50.137
You're upside down five stacks

1147
00:56:50.137 --> 00:56:52.586
and that's before I've
added your car note.

1148
00:56:52.586 --> 00:56:55.482
wifi. food. designer handbags.

1149
00:56:59.965 --> 00:57:01.068
You know what I think?

1150
00:57:02.206 --> 00:57:04.206
- I don't care what you think.

1151
00:57:04.206 --> 00:57:06.793
- You better. honey. 'cause
your life depends on it.

1152
00:57:08.793 --> 00:57:13.000
- You've been selling
the diamonds piece meal.

1153
00:57:14.724 --> 00:57:16.103
- What?

1154
00:57:16.103 --> 00:57:19.103
- Well. one here. one there.

1155
00:57:19.103 --> 00:57:23.000
- Losing the gap between
what you make. what you owe.

1156
00:57:23.931 --> 00:57:25.448
- You're insane.

1157
00:57:25.448 --> 00:57:29.137
Look. if I had $2 million I
would not have a roommate.

1158
00:57:29.137 --> 00:57:33.103
She pays half of my rent that
gives me just enough money

1159
00:57:33.103 --> 00:57:38.034
to then buy food and pay my
wifi and pay my car note.

1160
00:57:38.793 --> 00:57:40.103
And my purse by the way.

1161
00:57:40.103 --> 00:57:43.379
it was a gift from a
pilot that I work with.

1162
00:57:43.379 --> 00:57:46.758
- Well you just have a
clever answer for everything.

1163
00:57:46.758 --> 00:57:47.965
- Yeah. well you
know it's not hard

1164
00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:49.206
when the person
you're talking to

1165
00:57:49.206 --> 00:57:51.068
is not as smart as
they think they are.

1166
00:57:51.068 --> 00:57:52.344
- You know what I do know.

1167
00:57:53.827 --> 00:57:56.448
every deep. dark secret
you've ever pondered

1168
00:57:56.448 --> 00:57:58.724
because your idiot
boyfriend told them to me.

1169
00:57:59.896 --> 00:58:01.655
I know about your
crossdressing brother.

1170
00:58:01.655 --> 00:58:04.275
your alcoholic mother.
her boyfriend. Moses

1171
00:58:04.275 --> 00:58:07.862
who molested you until you
were 16 ran away from Detroit

1172
00:58:09.034 --> 00:58:10.827
that you turned tricks
for hot meals in LA

1173
00:58:10.827 --> 00:58:15.448
until Troy found you. and
I know about
the fucking diamonds.

1174
00:58:17.517 --> 00:58:18.758
- You don't know shit.

1175
00:58:19.586 --> 00:58:21.413
- It is not important...

1176
00:58:27.896 --> 00:58:31.275
It is not important that
you believe me. Alicia

1177
00:58:34.137 --> 00:58:39.655
throughout this. I
have been kind. polite.

1178
00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.827
but I am done playing with you.

1179
00:58:44.862 --> 00:58:46.517
- No. no. no. no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no. no. no.

1180
00:58:46.517 --> 00:58:47.448
Listen. listen. listen.

1181
00:58:47.448 --> 00:58:49.965
I promise. I promise. I promise.

1182
00:58:49.965 --> 00:58:52.172
- Perky little buttons
and they are real too.

1183
00:58:53.137 --> 00:58:54.448
I've never been a breast man

1184
00:58:54.448 --> 00:58:55.965
So this is gonna be easy for me.

1185
00:58:55.965 --> 00:58:57.448
For you however-

1186
00:58:57.448 --> 00:59:01.827
- Please. please. please. I
promise to find those diamonds.

1187
00:59:46.586 --> 00:59:50.172
- Don't say a fucking
word or I'll kill him

1188
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:03.068
- How are you doing?

1189
01:00:03.068 --> 01:00:04.379
- Can I help you?

1190
01:00:04.379 --> 01:00:06.896
- Yes. is Alicia home?

1191
01:00:06.896 --> 01:00:08.862
- Yeah. but she's in the shower.

1192
01:00:10.172 --> 01:00:12.586
- Oh and you are?

1193
01:00:12.586 --> 01:00:13.413
- I'm Daniel.

1194
01:00:17.517 --> 01:00:21.344
- Oh. well I'm her neighbor.

1195
01:00:21.344 --> 01:00:23.000
- Ms. Valentine's
nephew. Steven.

1196
01:00:24.206 --> 01:00:26.034
She's the one throwing
the party upstairs.

1197
01:00:26.034 --> 01:00:28.655
- Oh yeah. one with all
the policemen. right?

1198
01:00:28.655 --> 01:00:31.103
You a cop too?

1199
01:00:31.103 --> 01:00:32.344
- I am.

1200
01:00:32.344 --> 01:00:34.172
She throws these
things every year.

1201
01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:35.862
Apologize there's
too much noise.

1202
01:00:35.862 --> 01:00:37.000
- Oh. it's no problem.

1203
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.034
We can barely hear it.

1204
01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:40.172
- Good.

1205
01:00:41.896 --> 01:00:47.379
- So you two are dating?

1206
01:00:48.034 --> 01:00:49.482
- I'm not really into labels.

1207
01:00:50.655 --> 01:00:51.862
Well then can you tell me

1208
01:00:51.862 --> 01:00:54.241
when Alicia will be
outta the shower?

1209
01:00:54.241 --> 01:00:55.931
- I don't know.

1210
01:00:55.931 --> 01:00:56.758
What's going on?

1211
01:00:59.965 --> 01:01:03.413
- Well. we stored some
champagne here for the party.

1212
01:01:03.413 --> 01:01:04.551
- it is your champagne.

1213
01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:05.931
- Of course it is.

1214
01:01:05.931 --> 01:01:08.896
I mean. unless Alicia's
becoming an alcoholic.

1215
01:01:08.896 --> 01:01:10.586
- Let me grab that for you.

1216
01:01:10.586 --> 01:01:11.413
- I'll help you.

1217
01:01:11.413 --> 01:01:13.103
- No. no. no.

1218
01:01:33.275 --> 01:01:36.103
- I hope you're not mad at us.

1219
01:01:36.103 --> 01:01:38.000
- Why would I be mad?

1220
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.206
- We drink a couple
bottles of your champagne.

1221
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:42.724
- I should hit you in the face.

1222
01:01:42.724 --> 01:01:43.793
- No. I'm sorry.

1223
01:01:43.793 --> 01:01:45.068
I can pay for 'em if you like.

1224
01:01:46.482 --> 01:01:47.275
- Forget it.

1225
01:01:48.551 --> 01:01:49.310
I'm just joking.

1226
01:01:50.275 --> 01:01:52.965
Consider a New Year's Eve gift.

1227
01:01:52.965 --> 01:01:54.310
- Thank you.

1228
01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:55.758
So how long you've been a cop?

1229
01:01:56.793 --> 01:01:58.000
- 12 Years and counting.

1230
01:02:00.137 --> 01:02:01.275
- Hold one second.

1231
01:02:02.896 --> 01:02:05.689
It's my aunt she's wondering
what's taking me so long.

1232
01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:06.517
I should be out.

1233
01:02:08.793 --> 01:02:09.896
Nice to meet you. Daniel.

1234
01:02:09.896 --> 01:02:11.068
- Yeah. for sure.

1235
01:02:11.068 --> 01:02:13.793
And I will tell
Alicia you stopped by.

1236
01:02:17.551 --> 01:02:19.034
- Before I forget.

1237
01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:25.517
happy new year.

1238
01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:28.724
- Happy new year.

1239
01:02:38.758 --> 01:02:41.344
- Is my shit together
or is my shit together?

1240
01:02:41.344 --> 01:02:43.172
- It's new Year's
you should stay.

1241
01:02:46.931 --> 01:02:51.379
- So why did your nephew
become a police officer?

1242
01:02:52.413 --> 01:02:53.551
- You'd have to ask him.

1243
01:02:53.551 --> 01:02:55.655
But as far as I know.

1244
01:02:55.655 --> 01:02:58.000
it was to be in the
family business.

1245
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.206
- Well his mother and father
are doctor and a lawyer.

1246
01:03:01.206 --> 01:03:02.655
How does that track?

1247
01:03:02.655 --> 01:03:04.793
- His grandfather was
in law enforcement

1248
01:03:04.793 --> 01:03:07.000
and so was his aunt.

1249
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:10.344
- He not just making that up?

1250
01:03:10.344 --> 01:03:11.689
- No.

1251
01:03:11.689 --> 01:03:12.724
- He's not my son?

1252
01:03:14.448 --> 01:03:15.241
- No.

1253
01:03:16.724 --> 01:03:18.758
- You know he'd be
about the right age.

1254
01:03:20.344 --> 01:03:21.172
- Yeah.

1255
01:03:23.034 --> 01:03:25.172
- How do I know you're
telling me the truth?

1256
01:03:28.724 --> 01:03:30.896
- Because I lost your child.

1257
01:03:34.689 --> 01:03:36.689
- You what?

1258
01:03:36.689 --> 01:03:38.206
- I lost your baby.

1259
01:03:44.965 --> 01:03:47.620
- But you took maternity leave?

1260
01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:51.206
- I took a leave of absence.
but it wasn't to have a baby.

1261
01:03:53.275 --> 01:03:54.896
- You lost the baby?

1262
01:03:57.413 --> 01:03:59.862
- Two weeks after
you got suspended.

1263
01:04:02.758 --> 01:04:04.275
- I am so sorry.

1264
01:04:06.448 --> 01:04:07.862
But you didn't say anything.

1265
01:04:07.862 --> 01:04:09.482
- To who?

1266
01:04:09.482 --> 01:04:12.586
The only person I
trusted ran her mouth

1267
01:04:12.586 --> 01:04:14.482
and got you suspended.

1268
01:04:14.482 --> 01:04:15.413
I couldn't risk it.

1269
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.241
- But you did take leave?

1270
01:04:19.241 --> 01:04:20.310
- Yes.

1271
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:22.034
- I don't understand.

1272
01:04:22.034 --> 01:04:23.827
- I needed time.

1273
01:04:23.827 --> 01:04:25.275
- Time for what?

1274
01:04:27.103 --> 01:04:28.689
- Time to get over you.

1275
01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:36.931
I lost the baby of the
man I loved more than air

1276
01:04:39.206 --> 01:04:40.413
and I couldn't face you.

1277
01:04:42.551 --> 01:04:47.000
So I left 'cause I needed
time to get over you

1278
01:04:49.827 --> 01:04:51.413
but it didn't work.

1279
01:04:52.862 --> 01:04:54.103
- It didn't?

1280
01:04:54.103 --> 01:04:56.931
- No. I know we
were forever ago.

1281
01:04:58.310 --> 01:05:05.034
but you had me and you
still got me and I hate it.

1282
01:05:08.275 --> 01:05:09.068
- I never knew.

1283
01:05:11.413 --> 01:05:14.034
You know we were good together.

1284
01:05:16.517 --> 01:05:19.827
You were the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1285
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.689
And there hasn't been
communication this bad

1286
01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:28.172
since the Cuban missile crisis.

1287
01:05:28.172 --> 01:05:30.206
[laughs]

1288
01:05:38.344 --> 01:05:45.000
- Well. we can try to make
up for it if you want to.

1289
01:05:46.379 --> 01:05:50.896
- I want to. I
want to very badly.

1290
01:05:58.172 --> 01:05:59.689
- It'll be the first
time with this guy

1291
01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.586
and I don't wanna
come off as a slut.

1292
01:06:01.586 --> 01:06:04.275
- There are exceptions
to the slut rule.

1293
01:06:04.275 --> 01:06:05.758
- Is New Year's Eve one?

1294
01:06:05.758 --> 01:06:09.068
- Yeah and birthdays and
Christmas and Valentine's day.

1295
01:06:09.068 --> 01:06:10.413
- Basically anytime it's a gift.

1296
01:06:10.413 --> 01:06:12.137
- And Halloween. when
you can just hook up.

1297
01:06:12.137 --> 01:06:14.586
- [Announcer] This a final
boarding call to flight A47.

1298
01:06:14.586 --> 01:06:17.103
- Does the new year officially
start at 12 midnight?

1299
01:06:17.103 --> 01:06:19.793
Or is there grace
period until sunrise?

1300
01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:22.517
Wait what'd you just say?

1301
01:06:22.517 --> 01:06:24.758
- Just sort of left
brain sex joke.

1302
01:06:25.965 --> 01:06:28.586
- I don't have anything
of value to add to this.

1303
01:06:28.586 --> 01:06:29.655
- [Announcer] Due to bad weather

1304
01:06:29.655 --> 01:06:30.620
all flights going to Chicago

1305
01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:32.103
have been canceled this evening.

1306
01:06:32.103 --> 01:06:34.620
- Let's get outta here before
they uncancel our flight.

1307
01:06:35.517 --> 01:06:36.758
- That's not how it works.

1308
01:06:39.103 --> 01:06:41.068
- I see you got the champagne.

1309
01:06:41.068 --> 01:06:42.689
- Mission accomplished.

1310
01:06:42.689 --> 01:06:45.241
- Couldn't convince
Alicia to come?

1311
01:06:45.241 --> 01:06:47.724
- I didn't even see her.
she has a guy over there.

1312
01:06:48.896 --> 01:06:51.448
[upbeat music]

1313
01:07:01.724 --> 01:07:04.413
- I am glad everyone's
having such a good time.

1314
01:07:04.413 --> 01:07:06.689
And we are just getting started.

1315
01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:10.275
So put your hands
together for Dave.

1316
01:07:11.448 --> 01:07:14.862
[audience claps]

[upbeat music]

1318
01:07:38.862 --> 01:07:41.896
- Stupid bitch. are you
out of your fucking mind?

1319
01:07:45.413 --> 01:07:48.379
Didn't your parents teach
you not to play with fire?

1320
01:07:52.689 --> 01:07:55.965
- You are really. really
testing my patience.

1321
01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:59.413
- If you think I'm
just gonna sit here

1322
01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:01.689
every chance I get.
I'm going for mine.

1323
01:08:10.137 --> 01:08:11.758
- It's security. isn't it?

1324
01:08:11.758 --> 01:08:13.206
Answer me. it's
building security.

1325
01:08:13.206 --> 01:08:14.689
The smoke alarm is connected

1326
01:08:14.689 --> 01:08:16.241
to the building security system.

1327
01:08:17.379 --> 01:08:19.103
Otherwise they would've
called your phone.

1328
01:08:22.068 --> 01:08:23.413
- Happy new year.

1329
01:08:23.413 --> 01:08:24.655
- Hi. Sorry to disturb you

1330
01:08:24.655 --> 01:08:26.655
but this is Rigo
Hernandez in security.

1331
01:08:26.655 --> 01:08:29.206
- Yeah. Rigo. the smoke alarm.

1332
01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:31.413
We were trying to get a
jumpstart on New Year's dinner

1333
01:08:31.413 --> 01:08:34.034
and I'm just for shit
when it comes to cooking.

1334
01:08:34.034 --> 01:08:36.068
- Is Ms. Gregory
or Davenport there?

1335
01:08:36.068 --> 01:08:37.517
- Yeah. Alicia's in the kitchen.

1336
01:08:37.517 --> 01:08:38.620
- May I speak with her?

1337
01:08:39.517 --> 01:08:41.275
- Yeah. sure. Rigo.

1338
01:08:41.275 --> 01:08:42.103
Babe.

1339
01:08:44.379 --> 01:08:46.379
I have a confession to make.

1340
01:08:46.379 --> 01:08:50.275
I don't know shit about books or
arbitrage or fancy restaurants.

1341
01:08:50.275 --> 01:08:52.034
but I know a dozen
ways to kill a man.

1342
01:08:52.034 --> 01:08:54.448
So if Rigo. the security
guard comes up here

1343
01:08:54.448 --> 01:08:56.103
to investigate the fire alarm

1344
01:08:56.103 --> 01:08:59.034
I will cut his ass every
which way but loose.

1345
01:08:59.034 --> 01:09:00.137
Do you understand?

1346
01:09:01.482 --> 01:09:02.517
Say it.

1347
01:09:02.517 --> 01:09:03.344
- I understand.

1348
01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:06.448
Start talking and make it good.

1349
01:09:09.965 --> 01:09:10.758
- Hello.

1350
01:09:10.758 --> 01:09:11.931
- Ms. Gregory.

1351
01:09:11.931 --> 01:09:13.103
- Hi.

1352
01:09:13.103 --> 01:09:14.586
- Hi. this is Rigo
Hernandez in security.

1353
01:09:15.655 --> 01:09:17.689
You sound out breath.

1354
01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:18.862
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

1355
01:09:18.862 --> 01:09:20.482
I was making barbecue
in the kitchen.

1356
01:09:20.482 --> 01:09:21.931
I got something on my hand.

1357
01:09:21.931 --> 01:09:23.413
That's why I didn't
answer the phone.

1358
01:09:23.413 --> 01:09:24.655
We're fine.

1359
01:09:24.655 --> 01:09:25.448
I'm fine.

1360
01:09:26.448 --> 01:09:27.620
- That's good to hear.

1361
01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.758
Oh and by the way.
what's your code word?

1362
01:09:33.344 --> 01:09:34.275
- Diamonds.

1363
01:09:36.344 --> 01:09:39.172
- Okay. That's all I need
from you Ms. Gregory.

1364
01:09:39.172 --> 01:09:40.448
Happy new year.

1365
01:09:40.448 --> 01:09:41.793
- Happy new year.

1366
01:09:55.965 --> 01:09:59.344
- That was magnificent.

1367
01:09:59.344 --> 01:10:03.275
I cannot tell you how
happy that just made me.

1368
01:10:03.275 --> 01:10:04.758
It almost makes me forgive you

1369
01:10:04.758 --> 01:10:06.655
for lying about the champagne.

1370
01:10:06.655 --> 01:10:09.586
I especially like
your code word.

1371
01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:54.000
- [Announcer] The voicemail
box you reached is full.

1372
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.655
Please hang up and try again.

1373
01:11:15.172 --> 01:11:17.551
- The long day and a long night.

1374
01:11:18.758 --> 01:11:21.620
It is almost new year
but before that happens.

1375
01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:24.000
you are going to tell me
where the diamonds are.

1376
01:11:25.689 --> 01:11:26.896
- I've gotta pee.

1377
01:11:26.896 --> 01:11:29.000
- I don't care.

1378
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.068
You have been playing
games with me all night

1379
01:11:31.068 --> 01:11:33.000
and playtime is over.

1380
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.689
- Please let me go to
the bathroom. please.

1381
01:11:37.172 --> 01:11:38.724
- Look. if you let
me use the bathroom.

1382
01:11:38.724 --> 01:11:41.172
then I will tell you whatever
it is you wanna know.

1383
01:12:03.655 --> 01:12:05.586
No. no. no. no

1384
01:12:40.965 --> 01:12:42.620
So would it be too much to ask

1385
01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:44.896
for just a little bit
of privacy. please?

1386
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:57.137
Really?

1387
01:12:58.586 --> 01:13:01.000
I mean. you've been all
talk. the silent treatment.

1388
01:13:03.827 --> 01:13:05.965
Well it's fine. but
it's gonna take a while.

1389
01:13:08.172 --> 01:13:10.655
I mean. it took me months to
tinkle in front of my boyfriend

1390
01:13:10.655 --> 01:13:13.241
and you are a stranger
who's holding me hostage.

1391
01:13:13.241 --> 01:13:14.448
So just wait.

1392
01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:23.206
Look. it didn't
have to be this way.

1393
01:13:25.137 --> 01:13:28.724
Okay. I wonder if
circumstances were different

1394
01:13:28.724 --> 01:13:32.068
and you weren't convinced
that I had these diamonds.

1395
01:13:32.068 --> 01:13:34.896
I wonder what could
have happened.

1396
01:14:57.793 --> 01:15:00.241
- How many times do I have...

1397
01:15:03.206 --> 01:15:04.448
I do not know-

1398
01:15:04.448 --> 01:15:05.275
- Shut up.

1399
01:15:10.482 --> 01:15:11.482
I'm hip to your game.

1400
01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:15.620
I'm hip.

1401
01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:19.241
You scare the shit out of
me and then reprieve.

1402
01:15:20.137 --> 01:15:21.137
That's your get down.

1403
01:15:22.275 --> 01:15:25.000
- Amazing. the plan didn't work.

1404
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.827
- What are you now?

1405
01:15:25.827 --> 01:15:26.655
An ice man.

1406
01:15:28.448 --> 01:15:29.655
Cold and silent.

1407
01:15:30.655 --> 01:15:31.862

we're telling them.

that they're dumb.

out what have I done

you're dumb. Alicia.

01:25:08.517 --> 01:25:10.551
So you set me up.

- Yes. Yes. Alicia I did.

01:25:12.965 --> 01:25:15.068
- But I let you live with me.

1545
01:25:15.068 --> 01:25:17.517

of dollars in diamonds.

couldn't find them.

into his own hands.

would you kill him?

serves me right.
