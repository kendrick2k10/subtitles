3
00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.729
- I have a secret.

4
00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:32.945
Don't think what
I'm doing is easy.

5
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:39.577
{\an8}My sister. 15.

6
00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:41.787
{\an8}trying so hard to look perfect.

7
00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:44.456
{\an8}She can't see she's
already beautiful.

8
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.753
{\an8}My mom. she used to
smile all the time.

9
00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.005
{\an8}Where did that go?

10
00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:55.384
{\an8}And my dad on his computer.

11
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:56.802
{\an8}He always says it's work.

12
00:02:56.927 --> 00:03:00.097
{\an8}but so many times.
it's really not.

13
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.730
{\an8}I'm casting a spell to bake
us back together again.

14
00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:09.148
happy and sweet.

15
00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:18.157
{\an8}- You ready to go?

16
00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:19.325
{\an8}- Almost.

17
00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:19.950
{\an8}- Now we cannot be late. okay?

18
00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:20.784
{\an8}- Okay.

19
00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:24.747
{\an8}My family can't even see me.

20
00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.874
{\an8}- We have to leave.
like. right now.

21
00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.459
{\an8}- But my cookies
aren't done yet.

22
00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:29.960
{\an8}- She just wants
to ruin it for me.

23
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:31.837
{\an8}- Come on. Violet. hurry up.

24
00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:38.844
{\an8}- Oh. yeah. my secret.

25
00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:43.015
Sometimes I think I'm a witch.

26
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:00.991
As for that spell.

27
00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.953
I said it wasn't easy.

28
00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:06.747
And now. I've ruined everything.

29
00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:10.793
- Watch what you wish for.

30
00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.297
It's not making sense.

31
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.715
Should I pull over?

32
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.841
No. no.
no. keep going.

33
00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.053
Said one
lemming to another.

34
00:04:21.178 --> 00:04:21.887
Huh.

35
00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.222
- Quit it.

36
00:04:23.347 --> 00:04:24.390
- Violet.

37
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.352
- Oh. go. go right at
this traffic circle.

38
00:04:28.477 --> 00:04:29.520
- Wait. wh-which right?

39
00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:30.479
There are. like. five choices.

40
00:04:31.522 --> 00:04:32.731
Hello? Any clues?

41
00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:33.649
I give up.

42
00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:34.775
- Typical.

43
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.318
- What is that supposed to mean?

44
00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:37.111
- A'right. give me
the phone. I'll do it.

45
00:04:38.696 --> 00:04:40.406
- Can you? Why did
she have to come?

46
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:42.866
- Found it. Thank God for me.

47
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.047
Uh. miss. uh. miss...

48
00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:06.390
I guess that's her. right?

49
00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:07.850
- Yeah.

50
00:05:11.687 --> 00:05:13.105
- Everything is ready for you.

51
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:15.733
Oh. Adam!

52
00:05:15.858 --> 00:05:16.942
- Yana. how are you?

53
00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:17.943
Good.

54
00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:18.986
- Good to see you.

55
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:19.862
- Savannah.

56
00:05:19.987 --> 00:05:20.904
- Hi.

57
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.364
- Hi.

58
00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:23.782
- And this is Chloe.
Savannah's mom.

59
00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:24.658
- Hi.

60
00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:32.958
So nice to finally meet you.

61
00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.501
You must be a model too.

62
00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.128
- I was. of course.

63
00:05:36.253 --> 00:05:38.547
but now Yana is
all about business.

64
00:05:38.672 --> 00:05:40.632
And Yana's business today

65
00:05:40.758 --> 00:05:43.052
is to find a face for her line.

66
00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:45.387
So let's go. people! Let's move!

67
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.142
- Stop.

68
00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:09.221
- Not much to get excited about.

69
00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:11.056
I don't know.

70
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:12.266
This one's pretty special.

71
00:07:35.831 --> 00:07:39.001
- Oh my God. Violet.

72
00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:40.752
Outside. Now.

73
00:09:09.258 --> 00:09:10.133
- Ciao.

74
00:09:12.678 --> 00:09:13.428
- Ciao.

75
00:09:19.643 --> 00:09:21.186
- I don't know what that means.

76
00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:28.151
- The auction place
where they sell the cows.

77
00:09:28.277 --> 00:09:30.237
- There's no cows here.

78
00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:31.113
- No?

79
00:09:35.117 --> 00:09:36.159
- That's mean.

80
00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:44.084
- Feel the light. feel
the beautiful light.

81
00:09:57.514 --> 00:09:58.473
- Que bello.

82
00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:01.893
I. I'm Daniele.

83
00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:02.769
- Violet.

84
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:08.066
- You not one of them?

85
00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:10.527
No. are you?

86
00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:13.196
Eww. no.

87
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:15.907
- So why are you here?

88
00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:20.037
- Boss lady. she's my matrigna.

89
00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:22.497
- Daniele. what are you doing?

90
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:27.294
Where is my package?
Get inside now.

91
00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:32.215
- Stepmother. I.
I. I have to go.

92
00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:43.226
- See you. darling.

93
00:10:44.478 --> 00:10:46.897
What?

94
00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:51.318
- Why Savannah?

95
00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:52.694
- Trust me. she'll bring me

96
00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:53.820
the key to Paradiso.
- She's not

97
00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:55.322
the face of your collection.

98
00:10:55.447 --> 00:10:57.991
I know what look I
need. and I know...

99
00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.868
- Brava. Savannah.

100
00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.328
Congratulations.
- Uh.

101
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.373
- This is Franco.

102
00:11:04.498 --> 00:11:05.415
- Oh. hi. I'm. uh. I'm Adam.

103
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.875
This is my wife. Chloe.

104
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.177
Thank you.
it's all so unexpected.

105
00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:20.180
Savannah has to
look like she's just...

106
00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:21.973
- It's about time.

107
00:11:22.099 --> 00:11:24.142
- And who is this little angel?

108
00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.936
- Oh. the naughty
daughter. Violet.

109
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:27.479
Violet.

110
00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:29.606
She could be
a model like her sister.

111
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:31.525
Look at this
contract. would you?

112
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.401
- Sure.

113
00:11:33.652 --> 00:11:35.737
Oh. uh. it's. uh.
it's in Italian.

114
00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:39.533
- Oh. well. that
shouldn't be a problem

115
00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:40.367
for you. right?

116
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:45.747
Uh. no.

117
00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:47.666
Thank you.

118
00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.215
Come on. you see what
Savannah was wearing today?

119
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.259
I mean. a little slutty.

120
00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:58.385
That's
what kids wear now.

121
00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.845
For the last time. no!

122
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.806
- How come it's fine
for her but not for me?

123
00:12:02.931 --> 00:12:05.100
- Your sister thinks this
is a big opportunity.

124
00:12:05.225 --> 00:12:07.102
I disagree. but she's old enough

125
00:12:07.227 --> 00:12:08.770
to start making
decisions like that.

126
00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.772
You on the other hand

127
00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:12.983
aren't quite there yet.

128
00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:14.568
- It's not fair.

129
00:12:14.693 --> 00:12:16.361
- When you're 15. if
you still want creeps

130
00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.863
like Franco to use your body

131
00:12:17.988 --> 00:12:19.364
to sell sleazy clothes. then-

132
00:12:19.489 --> 00:12:21.908
- I am not letting
Franco use my body.

133
00:12:22.033 --> 00:12:23.660
That's what
photographers do.

134
00:12:23.785 --> 00:12:24.953
- Hey!
- I know. I know

135
00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:26.580
what photographers do.

136
00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:28.206
That's why I'm taking
time off work tomorrow

137
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:29.458
to make sure he doesn't.

138
00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:30.333
- Oh. right.

139
00:12:31.877 --> 00:12:32.878
- What?

140
00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:34.087
- Yeah. that's why you're going.

141
00:12:35.255 --> 00:12:36.131
- It is.

142
00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:38.884
- I'm not blind.

143
00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:50.437
- Listen. honey. we.

144
00:12:50.562 --> 00:12:51.563
we don't ever wanna stop you

145
00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:52.939
living the life you wanna live.

146
00:12:53.064 --> 00:12:55.942
but everything has a season.

147
00:12:56.067 --> 00:12:57.068
- What's the big deal?

148
00:12:57.194 --> 00:12:58.695
What are you so scared of?

149
00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:06.369
- There's things out there.

150
00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:09.498
- Out where?

151
00:13:10.707 --> 00:13:13.043
- Dangerous things
in. in. in the world.

152
00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.419
Your. your mother
and I just want you

153
00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.379
to. to. to stay safe.

154
00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:18.924
- You mean like
creepy men saying.

155
00:13:19.049 --> 00:13:20.300
"Get in my car. little girl.

156
00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.010
I'll give you some candy"?

157
00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:23.303
Yes. yes. but
not just stuff like that.

158
00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:24.179
- Then what?

159
00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:34.022
Look. it.
it's. it's like a plug.

160
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:39.361
a really big one.

161
00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.030
Giant plug?

162
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.740
- Yes. with a chain on it.

163
00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:46.952
- What if I open it?

164
00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:48.620
- No. no. no. don't do that.

165
00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:50.664
Well. the. the whole
world will get sucked down

166
00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:54.000
or

167
00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.044
bad things could come up.

168
00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:00.340
- Like what?

169
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:02.926
What bad things?

170
00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:04.052
- Just don't open it.

171
00:14:07.597 --> 00:14:08.557
yet. okay?

172
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.310
Come here.

173
00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:20.819
Love you. mm. Now.
get outta here.

174
00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.964
- You could destroy
us. you understand?

175
00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.716
Now look at me.

176
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.307
Feel your power!

177
00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:52.017
A little more to
your left. that's it.

178
00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:57.105
Now. okay. okay.
You are a spider.

179
00:14:57.814 --> 00:14:59.274
- Eww.

180
00:14:59.399 --> 00:15:00.483
- No. no. you. you're
not really a spider.

181
00:15:00.609 --> 00:15:02.027
but you're like a spider.

182
00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.487
And you eat your
boyfriends for lunch.

183
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:10.327
Okay. listen. it's
a metaphor. darling.

184
00:15:10.452 --> 00:15:12.287
Do you know what a metaphor is?

185
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.706
That's it. that's great.

186
00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:15.790
That's great. perfect.

187
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:16.625
Hold that!

188
00:15:18.668 --> 00:15:21.379
Okay. show me how
you devour your prey.

189
00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:22.505
Show me. I wanna see it.

190
00:15:22.631 --> 00:15:23.673
I wanna see it in your face.

191
00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:24.633
That's good.

192
00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.259
- You know what I mean?

193
00:15:26.384 --> 00:15:27.302
One foot forward.

194
00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.303
Now lean towards me.

195
00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:29.512
- Hey. Mom.

196
00:15:29.638 --> 00:15:31.681
- Hi. you want a gelato?

197
00:15:31.806 --> 00:15:34.726
- No. thanks. This is boring.

198
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:35.685
- Oh. if I have to be here.

199
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.936
you have to be here.

200
00:15:42.901 --> 00:15:44.527
- Can I go for a walk?

201
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.614
- Why don't you just stay here?

202
00:15:47.739 --> 00:15:49.532
- But I wanna see the town.

203
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:54.120
- Don't go outside the
walls. okay? Promise.

204
00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:57.832
Promise. Violet.

205
00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:03.171
- Fine. okay. I promise.

206
00:16:04.714 --> 00:16:06.174
That's
good. you are. uh.

207
00:16:06.299 --> 00:16:08.885
that's incredible.

208
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:09.761
- Okay. alright.

209
00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:13.682
- Yes.
- That's it. alright.

210
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.860
- Ciao.

211
00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:30.198
- Ciao. what are you doing?

212
00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.866
- I'm running away.

213
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.618
- To where?

214
00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:34.494
- Out there.

215
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.539
- There? There is only forest.

216
00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.499
- Sounds good to me.

217
00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:41.251
- No. it is not good.

218
00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:45.338
A witch sleeps
there. a real one.

219
00:16:45.463 --> 00:16:46.840
- Yeah. right.

220
00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:48.174
My farm
was there. I know.

221
00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:50.218
- I'd rather take my chances.

222
00:16:50.343 --> 00:16:53.388
- Daniele! You're
holding all of us up.

223
00:17:01.896 --> 00:17:02.814
- Be careful.

224
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.648
Kill me.
kill me with your eyes.

225
00:18:26.773 --> 00:18:27.899
That's it.

226
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:30.443
Now. give him more anger.

227
00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:31.945
More anger. I wanna
see more anger.

228
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.571
That's it. No. that's
too much anger.

229
00:18:33.696 --> 00:18:34.531
Too much anger.

230
00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:35.573
Yeah. that's it.

231
00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:36.699
- Where's Violet?

232
00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:38.326
- She went for a walk.

233
00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:39.452
Look at me.

234
00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:40.620
- You let her go on her own?

235
00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:41.830
- Your daughter's all by herself

236
00:18:41.955 --> 00:18:43.331
in this scary old village

237
00:18:43.456 --> 00:18:45.250
with no big strong
man to protect her.

238
00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:48.169
- Yeah. well. you never
know what's out there.

239
00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:49.212
Not so sweet.

240
00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:50.630
- She'll be fine.

241
00:18:55.885 --> 00:18:58.847
- Put. put. put
one leg over this.

242
00:19:02.934 --> 00:19:03.726
- Daniele!

243
00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:06.729
Daniele!

244
00:19:11.985 --> 00:19:13.027
Daniele.

245
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:14.612
What do you want?

246
00:19:14.737 --> 00:19:15.572
- Get off the scooter.

247
00:19:15.697 --> 00:19:17.115
- No. my father give it.

248
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:17.907
- Look.

249
00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:19.325
- For me.

250
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.036
- Calm down. I
have an idea. okay?

251
00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.121
- I said no.

252
00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:25.832
- Yana.

253
00:19:25.957 --> 00:19:27.876
- Daniele. do what he says.

254
00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:30.587
- Okay.

255
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:37.760
- Get off the scooter!

256
00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:42.932
Savannah.

257
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:56.923
- Mother.

258
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:06.724
You gave me this gift.

259
00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:09.852
The flowers that love me.

260
00:21:11.729 --> 00:21:12.855
Is love the key?

261
00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:21.155
Speak to me.

262
00:21:42.385 --> 00:21:43.386
Why me?

263
00:22:05.241 --> 00:22:06.451
Will you teach me?

264
00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:13.833
I will listen to you. I promise.

265
00:22:13.958 --> 00:22:15.251
Oh. that's good.

266
00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:16.627
Now. move the hair
out of your eye.

267
00:22:16.753 --> 00:22:17.462
Yeah. yeah. that's
it. that's it.

268
00:22:17.587 --> 00:22:18.379
A little more.

269
00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:20.506
Okay. head back more.

270
00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:21.674
Put your. put your left hand

271
00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:23.009
on the back of the seat there.

272
00:22:23.134 --> 00:22:24.093
Nice. nice.

273
00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:25.511
- I won't stay here long.

274
00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:27.680
- Well. do you
want me to get off?

275
00:22:27.805 --> 00:22:28.723
- What do you want?

276
00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.977
- Ah. nice. You read my mind.

277
00:22:36.606 --> 00:22:37.774
- Hey. Savannah! Hold. Savannah!

278
00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:38.900
- Savannah!

279
00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:40.026
- Daniele!

280
00:23:28.533 --> 00:23:29.367
- Hello.

281
00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:31.369
- Hi. are you the witch?

282
00:23:37.166 --> 00:23:40.837
The
witch or a witch?

283
00:23:40.962 --> 00:23:42.797
- A boy told me a
witch lives here.

284
00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:47.343
- Oh. my name's
Hazel. what's yours?

285
00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:48.886
- Violet.

286
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:51.889
- Well. Violet. if
you believe everything

287
00:23:52.014 --> 00:23:53.933
that boys tell you.

288
00:23:54.058 --> 00:23:56.018
you're gonna have
a very rough life.

289
00:23:57.103 --> 00:23:59.021
Oh. meet Delilah.

290
00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:05.278
Wanna see my garden?

291
00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:07.989
- Okay.

292
00:24:24.172 --> 00:24:24.922
Wow.

293
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:34.432
- Ahh. ahh. ah. no. no.

294
00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:38.060
Naked Ladies. very dangerous.

295
00:24:38.186 --> 00:24:39.312
- Dangerous?

296
00:24:39.437 --> 00:24:40.188
- Poison.

297
00:24:41.147 --> 00:24:42.565
- And that one?

298
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.776
- Oh. Angel's Trumpet.
extremely deadly.

299
00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:47.236
- Is everything here poisonous?

300
00:24:47.361 --> 00:24:48.279
- Not everything.

301
00:25:01.626 --> 00:25:03.252
- I know these.

302
00:25:03.377 --> 00:25:04.962
They won't hurt me.

303
00:25:05.087 --> 00:25:08.049
- Really? Well. it depends
on how you treat them.

304
00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:13.512
- Wow. nice.

305
00:25:13.638 --> 00:25:16.098
- You can have one
if you can reach it.

306
00:26:33.426 --> 00:26:34.802
Oh. come on. she's too young.

307
00:26:58.492 --> 00:26:59.577
Well. look who's up.

308
00:26:59.702 --> 00:27:01.203
- What happened?

309
00:27:01.329 --> 00:27:03.122
- That apple was too high.

310
00:27:03.247 --> 00:27:05.958
- No. the ladder was too short.

311
00:27:06.083 --> 00:27:06.792
- Oh.

312
00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:20.014
You hungry?

313
00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:21.223
- I guess.

314
00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:24.226
Are these poisonous too?

315
00:27:25.353 --> 00:27:26.812
- You're interested in flowers?

316
00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:29.940
- Flowers are interested in me.

317
00:27:30.066 --> 00:27:34.236
- Oh. so you know what
flowers are for then?

318
00:27:35.321 --> 00:27:38.240
- They aren't for anything.

319
00:27:38.366 --> 00:27:39.408
They're just flowers.

320
00:27:40.618 --> 00:27:43.579
- They're actually
sexual organs.

321
00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:48.334
- Eww.

322
00:27:49.585 --> 00:27:51.712
- There's nothing eww about it.

323
00:27:51.837 --> 00:27:52.630
It's just true.

324
00:27:55.132 --> 00:27:58.886
Well. except for those.

325
00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:00.971
What you think are their flowers

326
00:28:01.097 --> 00:28:02.223
are actually their stomachs.

327
00:28:02.348 --> 00:28:04.350
- Plants don't have stomachs.

328
00:28:04.475 --> 00:28:05.768
- They're carnivorous.

329
00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.403
They like their meat
fresh and alive.

330
00:28:22.493 --> 00:28:26.455
So all alone in the forest.

331
00:28:27.415 --> 00:28:30.459
Now. what's that about?

332
00:28:30.584 --> 00:28:33.295
- Well. everybody
else was so busy

333
00:28:34.296 --> 00:28:35.256
with my sister.

334
00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:39.427
- And you wish they'd
be busy with you?

335
00:28:39.552 --> 00:28:41.095
- No one even sees me.

336
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.847
It's like I'm not even there.

337
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.810
Mm. so you
want them to see you

338
00:28:47.935 --> 00:28:49.311
like they see your sister?

339
00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.107
- Not. not exactly.

340
00:28:53.232 --> 00:28:56.694
But why not? Seems like fun.

341
00:28:57.736 --> 00:29:00.322
- Oh. power is always fun.

342
00:29:00.448 --> 00:29:02.408
It's just not always safe.

343
00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:04.326
You
sound like my dad.

344
00:29:04.452 --> 00:29:08.330
He said. "It was
like a giant plug."

345
00:29:08.456 --> 00:29:09.206
- It?

346
00:29:10.332 --> 00:29:13.627
- You know. sex.

347
00:29:14.879 --> 00:29:15.963
He can't talk about it

348
00:29:16.088 --> 00:29:18.132
without getting embarrassed.

349
00:29:20.676 --> 00:29:22.344
- You wanna see it for yourself?

350
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.694
- Um. how far are we gonna go?

351
00:29:39.653 --> 00:29:41.822
- Well. it's just through there.

352
00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:43.407
- What is?

353
00:29:43.532 --> 00:29:47.036
- Well. go and see.

354
00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:13.395
Go on. you'll be fine.

355
00:30:46.804 --> 00:30:47.513
- No way.

356
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.584
Open it. open it.

357
00:31:16.709 --> 00:31:18.127
- Who said that?

358
00:31:18.252 --> 00:31:19.545
A friend. a friend.

359
00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:21.422
- How do I know
you're my friend?

360
00:31:21.547 --> 00:31:25.092
I'm
only trying to help.

361
00:31:29.722 --> 00:31:33.434
Peek underneath. You'll
laugh when you see.

362
00:31:34.768 --> 00:31:36.478
- When I see what?

363
00:31:36.604 --> 00:31:40.482
What
you've been looking for.

364
00:31:59.209 --> 00:32:00.085
Go on. pull!

365
00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:10.971
Harder!

366
00:32:41.877 --> 00:32:42.628
- Whoa.

367
00:33:01.772 --> 00:33:02.648
- Hello.

368
00:33:08.112 --> 00:33:09.279
- Who are you?

369
00:33:09.405 --> 00:33:12.032
- I'm not you. I'm me.

370
00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:16.036
- If you're not me.
then who are you?

371
00:33:17.538 --> 00:33:19.039
- If I asked you
the same question.

372
00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:20.624
I'd get the same answer too.

373
00:33:20.749 --> 00:33:22.626
- So where are you?

374
00:33:22.751 --> 00:33:24.795
- Here. you're looking
right up at me.

375
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.046
- But I'm looking down.

376
00:33:26.171 --> 00:33:27.673
- No. I'm looking down.

377
00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:30.300
Can you find a rock?

378
00:33:30.426 --> 00:33:31.719
- What for?

379
00:33:31.844 --> 00:33:32.594
Can you?

380
00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:40.144
- Like this?

381
00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:41.937
- Yeah. perfect. Now
throw it up to me.

382
00:33:42.062 --> 00:33:43.439
- But you're down.

383
00:33:43.564 --> 00:33:46.692
- I told you. I'm
up. you're down.

384
00:33:46.817 --> 00:33:48.360
Now. come on. there's
not much time.

385
00:33:48.485 --> 00:33:49.528
- Time for what?

386
00:33:50.821 --> 00:33:51.697
Do you wanna find out

387
00:33:51.822 --> 00:33:52.823
what it's like or not?

388
00:33:52.948 --> 00:33:54.158
- Find out what what's like?

389
00:33:54.283 --> 00:33:56.410
- Just throw the stupid rock.

390
00:34:01.498 --> 00:34:02.207
Awesome.

391
00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:04.710
- I don't feel any different.

392
00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:06.837
- You will. here. catch.

393
00:34:38.202 --> 00:34:39.536
Better now?

394
00:34:40.621 --> 00:34:41.371
- What happened?

395
00:34:41.497 --> 00:34:42.748
- We switched.

396
00:34:42.873 --> 00:34:43.999
What? Okay.

397
00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:48.295
That was pretty cool.

398
00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.673
but let's switch back. please.

399
00:34:51.799 --> 00:34:54.843
- Not now. tomorrow
morning at sunrise.

400
00:34:54.968 --> 00:34:56.929
But if you're late.
you'll be stuck up there.

401
00:34:57.054 --> 00:34:59.139
And I'll be stuck
down here forever.

402
00:34:59.264 --> 00:35:01.391
- What? Wait.

403
00:35:01.517 --> 00:35:02.851
- Sunrise. promise?

404
00:35:02.976 --> 00:35:04.311
- Okay. okay. fine. I promise.

405
00:35:04.436 --> 00:35:05.729
- Don't forget to
put the plug back

406
00:35:05.854 --> 00:35:07.481
to make it all work. goodbye.

407
00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:08.899
- Wait. No!

408
00:35:09.024 --> 00:35:10.484
Stop! Please don't!

409
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:11.485
Stop! No!

410
00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.153
No! I changed my mind!

411
00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:21.787
- Welcome.

412
00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:23.705
Welcome.

413
00:35:26.583 --> 00:35:28.085
- Please don't eat me.

414
00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:32.798
- Eat you? You mean as
if you were a cookie?

415
00:35:34.007 --> 00:35:34.716
- I'm not a cookie.

416
00:35:37.761 --> 00:35:38.846
- You smell like one.

417
00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:42.975
Shall I try just a little bite?

418
00:35:52.943 --> 00:35:54.945
Play time's over.

419
00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.448
Quick. off you go
before I change my mind.

420
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:04.037
Good luck.

421
00:36:17.926 --> 00:36:19.344
- Well. what took you so long?

422
00:36:21.889 --> 00:36:24.766
- There's a huge creature thing

423
00:36:24.892 --> 00:36:26.643
who wants to. who
wants to eat me.

424
00:36:26.768 --> 00:36:28.228
- No. no. no.

425
00:36:28.353 --> 00:36:30.689
It just ate a bunch of
naughty boys last week.

426
00:36:30.814 --> 00:36:33.567
It can't possibly
have an appetite yet.

427
00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:35.152
- You tricked me.

428
00:36:35.277 --> 00:36:36.194
- Did I?

429
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.279
- Where am I?

430
00:36:37.404 --> 00:36:38.363
- On the other side.

431
00:36:38.488 --> 00:36:41.783
- Of what? Looks the same.

432
00:36:43.619 --> 00:36:44.328
- Does it?

433
00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.791
- No. yes.

434
00:36:50.918 --> 00:36:53.629
But.

435
00:36:55.631 --> 00:36:56.381
Oh my God.

436
00:36:57.966 --> 00:36:59.760
Do I still have
parents on this side?

437
00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:05.724
- Of course. and a
sister. don't forget.

438
00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:07.809
And everyone else.

439
00:37:11.063 --> 00:37:13.982
But you seem to have
lost your flower.

440
00:37:16.902 --> 00:37:19.905
- Well. yeah. that
water's really cold.

441
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:23.200
- Well. let's find you
something warm to wear.

442
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:40.842
I thought you were gonna hurry.

443
00:37:41.802 --> 00:37:42.552
- I am.

444
00:38:04.157 --> 00:38:04.866
- Oh. look at you.

445
00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:07.828
You look gorgeous.

446
00:38:07.953 --> 00:38:10.038
You are gonna make a
beautiful young woman.

447
00:38:10.163 --> 00:38:11.873
Well. you already are.

448
00:38:13.583 --> 00:38:16.253
Ooh. try one of these.

449
00:38:16.378 --> 00:38:17.671
They are delicious.

450
00:38:23.385 --> 00:38:26.346
- Mm. oh my God.

451
00:38:26.471 --> 00:38:28.807
- Right. you know those people

452
00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:30.934
that you were so keen
to hang out with.

453
00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:33.895
they would never let
you near food like this.

454
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:34.896
- That's messed up.

455
00:38:36.606 --> 00:38:38.275
- You know what's
really messed up?

456
00:38:39.776 --> 00:38:42.154
You not knowing how
incredibly pretty you are.

457
00:38:45.407 --> 00:38:46.158
So

458
00:38:53.123 --> 00:38:55.459
I want you to try
some of this drink.

459
00:38:57.794 --> 00:38:59.087
- No. thank you.

460
00:38:59.212 --> 00:39:00.964
- Come on. nothing
terrible's gonna happen.

461
00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:02.716
- I'm too young.

462
00:39:04.176 --> 00:39:05.594
- Not on this side. you're not.

463
00:39:05.719 --> 00:39:08.305
On this side. you know better.

464
00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.601
- So if I do something
on this side.

465
00:39:13.727 --> 00:39:14.978
does that change things

466
00:39:15.103 --> 00:39:16.188
on the other side too?

467
00:39:17.564 --> 00:39:19.983
- No more than any
action you take today

468
00:39:20.108 --> 00:39:23.695
could change the events
of yesterday.

469
00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:29.701
Unless. you've got to
make it to the plug

470
00:39:30.577 --> 00:39:32.329
before sunrise tomorrow morning

471
00:39:32.454 --> 00:39:36.541
because if you don't. you're
gonna be stuck on this side

472
00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:40.337
with all the choices
you've made forever.

473
00:39:46.259 --> 00:39:49.888
So. drink up.

474
00:39:51.056 --> 00:39:53.850
- I wanna go back now.

475
00:39:53.975 --> 00:39:55.102
Not 'til tomorrow morning.

476
00:39:55.227 --> 00:39:56.978
- I mean. to the town.

477
00:39:58.188 --> 00:39:58.980
- Oh.

478
00:40:01.733 --> 00:40:04.653
Well. well. off you go then.

479
00:40:04.778 --> 00:40:05.987
But you gotta be
careful. you know.

480
00:40:06.113 --> 00:40:08.949
those woods are very dangerous.

481
00:40:10.283 --> 00:40:11.368
You. you can always just

482
00:40:11.493 --> 00:40:12.994
stay here with me. right?

483
00:40:16.206 --> 00:40:18.291
Look. if you don't
like the fizz.

484
00:40:20.127 --> 00:40:21.545
try some of this lemonade

485
00:40:22.838 --> 00:40:23.839
my grandmother made.

486
00:40:23.964 --> 00:40:26.007
The secret is in the cinnamon...

487
00:40:32.264 --> 00:40:34.808
Oh. well. choose the right path.

488
00:41:07.382 --> 00:41:11.261
Boo. you
still smell like a cookie.

489
00:41:11.386 --> 00:41:14.055
and I'm feeling rather peckish.

490
00:42:00.352 --> 00:42:02.103
- Fancy meeting you here.

491
00:42:08.276 --> 00:42:09.444
- We need to talk.

492
00:42:10.403 --> 00:42:11.404
- Neutral ground?

493
00:42:28.505 --> 00:42:32.092
Go on. you'll be fine.

494
00:42:32.217 --> 00:42:34.135
Follow the red ribbon.

495
00:42:39.724 --> 00:42:41.726
- You know the rules.

496
00:42:41.851 --> 00:42:45.689
- And you know how
I feel about rules.

497
00:42:45.814 --> 00:42:49.109
- Paradiso is yours.
Inferno is mine.

498
00:42:49.234 --> 00:42:54.155
- Usually. but my girl
isn't usual. is she?

499
00:42:58.201 --> 00:43:00.287
- She's not yours.

500
00:43:00.412 --> 00:43:03.290
- Really? Are you sure?

501
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:06.876
- Her sister's as good as mine.

502
00:43:07.002 --> 00:43:08.837
Her parents too.

503
00:43:08.962 --> 00:43:11.423
She can't hold out against
all of them. poor girl.

504
00:43:11.548 --> 00:43:13.174
It's only a matter of time.

505
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:17.220
- And this key.

506
00:43:17.345 --> 00:43:19.431
- Yes. our mother's key.

507
00:43:20.348 --> 00:43:23.351
It must now pass to me.

508
00:43:23.476 --> 00:43:25.395
- It's not a trinket. Sister.

509
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.690
It's what makes
the flowers bloom.

510
00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:30.233
You burned yours.

511
00:43:30.358 --> 00:43:33.153
There's nothing left
in you to bloom.

512
00:43:33.278 --> 00:43:36.281
And yes. the key must pass.

513
00:43:36.406 --> 00:43:39.075
but to a child of flowers.

514
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.454
whom you've brought
to me.

515
00:43:42.579 --> 00:43:46.958
Would you even recognize
our mother if you saw her?

516
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:48.209
I wonder.

517
00:43:54.132 --> 00:43:56.259
- You. you. you would never

518
00:43:56.384 --> 00:43:58.136
pass it on to that little brat.

519
00:43:59.429 --> 00:44:01.556
- I'd sooner give it to her

520
00:44:01.681 --> 00:44:03.350
than let you get your grubby

521
00:44:03.475 --> 00:44:05.226
little mitts all over it.

522
00:44:05.352 --> 00:44:07.228
- She wouldn't know
what to do with it.

523
00:44:09.647 --> 00:44:10.774
- And you would?

524
00:44:30.043 --> 00:44:33.546
Oh. name your price.

525
00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:39.052
- You could never pay it.

526
00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:43.640
It has to be given
freely. remember?

527
00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:51.272
- Fine. give it to her.

528
00:44:52.399 --> 00:44:54.651
Go ahead. see what happens.

529
00:46:07.307 --> 00:46:12.270
♪ And I went both
night and day ♪

530
00:46:16.608 --> 00:46:21.362
♪ And you wiped my tears away ♪

531
00:46:25.658 --> 00:46:29.621
♪ And I went both
day and night ♪

532
00:46:35.043 --> 00:46:38.922
♪ Here from my heart to you ♪

533
00:46:48.556 --> 00:46:51.559
It will
be fun.

534
00:46:59.234 --> 00:46:59.984
- Pardon.

535
00:47:01.319 --> 00:47:05.573
Hey.

536
00:47:05.698 --> 00:47:06.741
- Ciao. bella.

537
00:47:07.951 --> 00:47:10.787
Huh.

538
00:48:58.269 --> 00:49:01.606
- Savannah! Is it you?

539
00:49:01.731 --> 00:49:03.066
- Of course it's me.

540
00:49:03.191 --> 00:49:05.985
- Ah. I've been looking
for you everywhere.

541
00:49:07.236 --> 00:49:08.237
- Wherever I go. whatever I do.

542
00:49:08.363 --> 00:49:10.448
you just have to tag along.

543
00:49:11.574 --> 00:49:12.617
- Do not!

544
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.995
Do you have any
idea where we are?

545
00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.665
- Ahh. duh. the hotel's
just around the corner.

546
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.375
Oh. and Mom's worried about you.

547
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.794
- No. No. I mean. this place.

548
00:49:22.919 --> 00:49:25.088
This other side. this!

549
00:49:25.213 --> 00:49:26.964
- What are you talking about?

550
00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:28.675
And where'd you get that dress?

551
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.176
- An old lady gave it to me.

552
00:49:30.301 --> 00:49:31.636
- Yeah. right.

553
00:49:31.761 --> 00:49:32.845
Did she give you
that padded bra too?

554
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.806
- Ah. I just saw
something awful!

555
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:37.392
- So awful it made
you grow boobs?

556
00:49:44.232 --> 00:49:45.191
Hey. what'd you see?

557
00:49:50.863 --> 00:49:54.283
- Dad. with his arm around Yana.

558
00:49:55.284 --> 00:49:55.993
- That's all?

559
00:49:56.119 --> 00:49:56.828
- That's all?

560
00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.288
What if he's in love with her?

561
00:50:00.206 --> 00:50:01.124
- Don't be stupid. Violet.

562
00:50:01.249 --> 00:50:02.417
- I'm not stupid.

563
00:50:02.542 --> 00:50:04.711
It's just

564
00:50:04.836 --> 00:50:07.714
everything in this
world is so wrong.

565
00:50:07.839 --> 00:50:09.590
This isn't our real life.

566
00:50:09.716 --> 00:50:11.384
- Did that old
lady get you drunk?

567
00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:14.011
- No! But there's a way back.

568
00:50:14.137 --> 00:50:15.680
I jumped through it.

569
00:50:15.805 --> 00:50:17.640
- That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

570
00:50:17.765 --> 00:50:19.183
- Just listen to me.

571
00:50:19.308 --> 00:50:21.310
We can go back. The
both of us together.

572
00:50:21.436 --> 00:50:24.689
- Why? I'm having fun here.

573
00:50:24.814 --> 00:50:26.190
- You don't understand anything.

574
00:50:26.315 --> 00:50:28.359
- But can you just
quit being so crazy?

575
00:50:28.484 --> 00:50:30.027
And don't you dare tell Mom.

576
00:50:30.153 --> 00:50:30.945
- Girls.

577
00:50:31.988 --> 00:50:33.197
- Hey. Mom.
- Hey. Mom.

578
00:50:35.158 --> 00:50:36.659
- You rode away in the
middle of your job.

579
00:50:36.784 --> 00:50:38.870
without permission.
on a motorcycle.

580
00:50:38.995 --> 00:50:40.747
- It was a scooter.

581
00:50:40.872 --> 00:50:42.248
- And you! I almost had the
police out looking for you.

582
00:50:42.373 --> 00:50:43.750
I should just ground
you both for life.

583
00:50:43.875 --> 00:50:44.917
- Mom. nothing even happened.

584
00:50:45.042 --> 00:50:47.378
- That is not the point!

585
00:50:47.503 --> 00:50:48.588
Where'd you get that outfit?

586
00:50:48.713 --> 00:50:49.756
- Some old lady gave it to her.

587
00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:50.631
- What?

588
00:50:53.134 --> 00:50:55.428
Are you wearing a-
- Leave me alone.

589
00:50:55.553 --> 00:50:56.846
- Oh. forget it.

590
00:50:56.971 --> 00:50:57.847
Let's just start getting
ready for dinner.

591
00:50:57.972 --> 00:50:59.223
We shouldn't be late.

592
00:51:14.447 --> 00:51:17.575
- Wow. My girls look
beautiful tonight.

593
00:51:20.912 --> 00:51:22.789
Violet. that is a great dress.

594
00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:27.668
What happened? You.
you look kinda. oh.

595
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.800
- Violet. sweetie.
where's your flower?

596
00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:38.429
- Uh.

597
00:51:40.139 --> 00:51:43.184
- You know. we got
some great stuff today.

598
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:44.685
You both should take a look.

599
00:51:48.898 --> 00:51:49.774
- Oh. these are beautiful.

600
00:51:49.899 --> 00:51:51.150
- Wow. Thank you.

601
00:51:58.616 --> 00:51:59.325
- Whoa.

602
00:52:01.994 --> 00:52:02.745
What?

603
00:52:06.374 --> 00:52:07.875
When were these taken?

604
00:52:09.961 --> 00:52:10.795
These were awful.

605
00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.338
- Dad.

606
00:52:12.463 --> 00:52:14.131
- Those were taken
today. you were there.

607
00:52:14.257 --> 00:52:15.925
- I. I certainly wasn't.

608
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.051
- Yeah. you were.
I could see you.

609
00:52:17.176 --> 00:52:18.678
You were reading your book.

610
00:52:18.803 --> 00:52:20.304
I must've
been on the phone.

611
00:52:20.429 --> 00:52:21.806
- Oh. no. no. no. no.

612
00:52:21.931 --> 00:52:23.182
You were telling me
a riveting story.

613
00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:24.976
something about. uh. your job.

614
00:52:27.937 --> 00:52:32.900
- Hmm. but Savannah
is beautiful. Yes?

615
00:52:37.029 --> 00:52:39.949
- Hello? The correct
answer is yes.

616
00:52:41.868 --> 00:52:43.536
- Where's Daniele?

617
00:52:43.661 --> 00:52:45.413
- Ugh. probably hiding from us.

618
00:52:45.538 --> 00:52:47.123
Knowing that boy.

619
00:52:47.248 --> 00:52:48.708
- He hates working for you.

620
00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:50.835
- Violet. mind
your own business.

621
00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.759
Why would anyone hide from you?

622
00:53:02.972 --> 00:53:05.016
- This one. Violeta.

623
00:53:07.226 --> 00:53:10.021
She has something so rare.

624
00:53:13.065 --> 00:53:13.774
So unique.

625
00:53:16.569 --> 00:53:19.113
Of course. it all
comes from you.

626
00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:27.955
- Mom. I don't feel very well.

627
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.582
can I go back?

628
00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:33.169
- Great idea. get some
rest for the party.

629
00:53:33.294 --> 00:53:34.921
- I don't wanna
come to your party.

630
00:53:36.297 --> 00:53:38.341
- But I can still go. right?

631
00:53:39.884 --> 00:53:43.721
- These. uh. these girls
broke a lot of rules today.

632
00:53:43.846 --> 00:53:45.681
So they need to go to bed

633
00:53:45.806 --> 00:53:47.350
and think about that. hmm.

634
00:53:49.894 --> 00:53:51.187
Alright. go ahead. honey.

635
00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:55.733
- Mom.

636
00:53:55.858 --> 00:53:56.943
- Well. I mean.
everybody's gonna be there.

637
00:53:57.068 --> 00:53:59.779
Magazine editors. model scouts.

638
00:53:59.904 --> 00:54:02.907
designers from London.
Paris. Milan. New York.

639
00:54:03.032 --> 00:54:06.494
Of course. Savannah
will be guest of honor.

640
00:54:06.619 --> 00:54:09.830
- That's. that's
very kind. but umm...

641
00:54:09.956 --> 00:54:10.957
Well. we've decided that-

642
00:54:11.082 --> 00:54:12.208
- Oh. come on. Dad. please!

643
00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:15.044
- No. No. it's too much.

644
00:54:16.587 --> 00:54:17.922
- This is so unfair.

645
00:54:18.047 --> 00:54:19.840
- Savannah. end of discussion.

646
00:55:02.133 --> 00:55:03.551
- What are you doing?

647
00:55:03.676 --> 00:55:05.886
You can't go to the
party. Dad said so.

648
00:55:06.012 --> 00:55:07.388
Shut up.

649
00:55:07.513 --> 00:55:09.432
Dad is not gonna
know unless you tell.

650
00:55:09.557 --> 00:55:11.225
- Why do you even wanna go?

651
00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:13.686
Because I'm
the guest of honor. Violet.

652
00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:14.937
- They're just saying that.

653
00:55:15.062 --> 00:55:16.397
- Next time you see me.

654
00:55:16.522 --> 00:55:18.566
I'm gonna be on
the cover of Vogue.

655
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:21.569
- Who cares? Everybody
there will be horrible.

656
00:55:24.196 --> 00:55:25.197
- Maybe you're right.

657
00:55:26.532 --> 00:55:27.908
Franco's kind of a creep.

658
00:55:28.034 --> 00:55:30.161
He looks at me like ugh.

659
00:55:30.286 --> 00:55:32.955
I mean while Dad is
drooling all over Yana.

660
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.041
and he can't see she's
just playing him.

661
00:55:35.166 --> 00:55:37.293
- Says the girl that's
being played by Yana.

662
00:55:38.919 --> 00:55:40.463
- The only nice one's Daniele.

663
00:55:42.006 --> 00:55:44.258
- He's too young for you.

664
00:55:44.383 --> 00:55:46.302
- It was so cool.
holding him tight

665
00:55:46.427 --> 00:55:47.928
on the back of his bike.

666
00:55:48.054 --> 00:55:48.929
I could smell him.

667
00:55:50.222 --> 00:55:51.724
- Eww.

668
00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:53.726
- Yeah. it wasn't exactly
like a nice smell.

669
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.936
but it was good.

670
00:56:35.101 --> 00:56:37.311
- Did you guys kiss?

671
00:56:37.436 --> 00:56:38.979
What? We were
in the middle of town.

672
00:56:39.105 --> 00:56:40.981
There are people.
like. everywhere.

673
00:56:42.858 --> 00:56:43.984
- So you didn't kiss?

674
00:56:47.655 --> 00:56:48.405
- Not yet.

675
00:57:10.010 --> 00:57:10.761
- Savannah.

676
00:57:13.389 --> 00:57:14.056
- Ciao.

677
00:57:14.181 --> 00:57:15.182
- Ciao.

678
00:57:15.307 --> 00:57:16.350
I can't believe this.

679
00:57:16.475 --> 00:57:18.352
How could you let this happen?

680
00:57:18.477 --> 00:57:20.104
Those pictures of Savannah.

681
00:57:20.229 --> 00:57:21.522
You basically signed
your own daughter

682
00:57:21.647 --> 00:57:23.232
up to make pornography.

683
00:57:23.357 --> 00:57:25.526
- No. no. I signed my
daughter up to be a model.

684
00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:26.402
Where were you?

685
00:57:27.987 --> 00:57:28.988
You were supposed to keep
an eye on that creep Franco.

686
00:57:29.113 --> 00:57:30.030
but somehow that never happened.

687
00:57:30.156 --> 00:57:31.448
- What does that mean?

688
00:57:31.574 --> 00:57:33.284
- You know exactly
what that means.

689
00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:35.661
- Is your sister with you?

690
00:57:35.786 --> 00:57:37.371
No.

691
00:57:37.496 --> 00:57:38.914
- Oh.

692
00:57:39.039 --> 00:57:40.082
- Are you here to
take me to the party?

693
00:57:42.459 --> 00:57:45.588
- Don't go. They're bad people.

694
00:57:45.713 --> 00:57:48.048
- It's fine. I'll
find it on my own.

695
00:57:48.174 --> 00:57:49.508
Oh. and don't bother
waiting for Violet.

696
00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:51.177
She's already asleep.

697
00:57:52.428 --> 00:57:54.471
- Oh. Oh. so it's my fault.

698
00:57:54.597 --> 00:57:56.182
I guess Yana's my fault too.

699
00:57:56.307 --> 00:57:57.266
- All right. can we please

700
00:57:57.391 --> 00:57:58.809
just go back to our room?

701
00:57:58.934 --> 00:58:00.019
- Why would I wanna
go back to the room?

702
00:58:00.144 --> 00:58:01.061
You don't wanna be with me!

703
00:58:01.187 --> 00:58:02.313
You wanna be with Yana!

704
00:58:02.438 --> 00:58:03.230
- Alright. listen to me.

705
00:58:03.355 --> 00:58:04.732
- Don't touch me!

706
00:58:04.857 --> 00:58:05.816
- All right. you
need to sleep it off!

707
00:58:05.941 --> 00:58:06.984
This conversation is over!

708
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:08.402
- Yeah. this marriage is over!

709
00:58:08.527 --> 00:58:10.029
Fine by me!

710
00:58:19.163 --> 00:58:20.581
Violet.

711
00:58:20.706 --> 00:58:24.126
- Yana. Yana thinks that
she decides everything.

712
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:28.380
But .
Franco has the eye.

713
00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:32.176
Franco chooses who Yana sees.

714
00:58:32.301 --> 00:58:35.763
And Franco chooses
how she sees her.

715
00:58:35.888 --> 00:58:37.806
Okay. with...

716
00:58:40.851 --> 00:58:44.521
Without Franco.
Yana sees nothing.

717
00:58:50.277 --> 00:58:53.948
And don't forget.
be nice to Franco.

718
00:58:58.285 --> 00:58:59.036
- Savannah!

719
00:59:00.496 --> 00:59:01.705
- What are you doing here?

720
00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:03.165
- Coming with you.

721
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:04.458
- No. you're not.

722
00:59:04.583 --> 00:59:05.876
- Please come back.

723
00:59:06.001 --> 00:59:07.711
- Leave me alone.

724
00:59:07.836 --> 00:59:09.088
- Are you meeting Daniele?

725
00:59:10.422 --> 00:59:12.091
- That's all you really
care about. isn't it?

726
00:59:12.216 --> 00:59:13.259
- Are you?

727
00:59:13.384 --> 00:59:14.593
- God. just quit following me.

728
00:59:14.718 --> 00:59:16.178
- I'll follow if I want to.

729
00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:18.806
He thinks you're a stupid cow.

730
00:59:18.931 --> 00:59:20.516
- Who? Who thinks
I'm a stupid cow?

731
00:59:20.641 --> 00:59:21.517
- Daniele. he told me.
- Daniele never said that.

732
00:59:21.642 --> 00:59:22.476
- Did too. yesterday.

733
00:59:22.601 --> 00:59:23.978
- Did not! Did not!

734
00:59:24.103 --> 00:59:25.104
- First thing when he
saw you at the audition.

735
00:59:25.229 --> 00:59:26.563
- You know. just because you

736
00:59:26.689 --> 00:59:28.232
suddenly grew a
pair of junior boobs

737
00:59:28.357 --> 00:59:30.359
does not mean you know anything.

738
00:59:30.484 --> 00:59:32.569
Daniele likes me.
and we're gonna kiss.

739
00:59:32.695 --> 00:59:34.238
- Fine! Go ahead!

740
00:59:34.363 --> 00:59:36.156
He's a jerk who only
wants to make out with you

741
00:59:36.282 --> 00:59:37.241
so he can brag about it!

742
00:59:37.366 --> 00:59:38.701
- Ugh!

743
01:00:05.311 --> 01:00:06.061
- Ciao.

744
01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:07.688
- Ciao.

745
01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:11.734
- Are you okay?

746
01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:14.695
- I'm fine.

747
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:18.949
- Did you go to the woods?

748
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:23.495
- You were right
about the witch. hmm.

749
01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:26.540
- What happened?

750
01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:27.416
- Nothing.

751
01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:30.169
- Are you sure?

752
01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:33.630
- You're looking for her. right?

753
01:00:34.757 --> 01:00:38.135
- Who. Savannah? No.

754
01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:41.805
- So. what are you doing here?

755
01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:47.227
- I'm waiting. and
I'll wait some more.

756
01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:48.020
- What for?

757
01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:50.230
- To be grown up.

758
01:00:57.363 --> 01:00:58.864
What do you wait for?

759
01:00:58.989 --> 01:00:59.782
- Sunrise.

760
01:01:01.617 --> 01:01:04.828
- You're lucky.
tomorrow you go home.

761
01:01:06.038 --> 01:01:07.998
Never have to see
Franco or Yana again.

762
01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:16.840
- I'd like to see you again.

763
01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:19.385
- I would like to see you too.

764
01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:28.268
For you. For when you go away.

765
01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:55.754
Wow!

766
01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.298
She's a lying little hypocrite.

767
01:01:58.424 --> 01:01:59.383
But she was right about you.

768
01:01:59.508 --> 01:02:00.509
- That's not what I meant.

769
01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:02.052
- Five minutes ago. she told me

770
01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:03.303
that you were nothing
but a little jerk

771
01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:04.430
trying to make out with girls

772
01:02:04.555 --> 01:02:05.556
so you could brag about it.

773
01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.102
Your exact words.

774
01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.103
- I hate you.

775
01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:12.938
- I hate you too.

776
01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.072
- Violet!

777
01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:25.826
Violet.

778
01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:36.587
- Chloe! Ah. I
thought it was you.

779
01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:41.133
It's nice to see you.

780
01:02:45.888 --> 01:02:46.638
What's wrong?

781
01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:53.103
- Mom?

782
01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.565
- Oh. oh no. Violet! Wait!

783
01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.485
Wait. stop!

784
01:03:02.196 --> 01:03:02.946
Violet!

785
01:03:18.587 --> 01:03:20.672
- Don't mess with Franco!

786
01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:26.178
If you do it again.
I will kill you.

787
01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:30.432
- No! Bastardo!

788
01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.956
Jerry. ah.

789
01:04:06.552 --> 01:04:08.845
Ciao.

790
01:04:08.971 --> 01:04:11.014
Franco knew you would
never stay away.

791
01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:13.559
And we're gonna find you
something fantastic to wear.

792
01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:14.601
- Oh. but-

793
01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:16.395
- You'll love it.

794
01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:23.652
- Uh.

795
01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:27.739
- You're early.

796
01:04:32.578 --> 01:04:35.163
- Go on! Do it!

797
01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:36.540
- Do what?

798
01:04:36.665 --> 01:04:38.208
- Bite my head
off. I don't care.

799
01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:40.002
- Why?

800
01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:43.255
Because your parents turned
out to be merely human?

801
01:04:44.548 --> 01:04:47.009
- They could be humans
without being so selfish.

802
01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:50.470
- Oh. so you're giving up?

803
01:04:50.596 --> 01:04:51.930
- No. I'm going back.

804
01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:53.765
where everything
else isn't so crap.

805
01:04:55.017 --> 01:04:58.437
- Huh? I thought you
were braver than that.

806
01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:01.648
- Brave? Nobody on
this side is brave.

807
01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.650
Everybody here is weak.

808
01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:06.528
and mean. and selfish.

809
01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:08.363
And I don't wanna
see them anymore.

810
01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:09.906
any of them.

811
01:05:10.032 --> 01:05:13.577
- What if they were all
the same on both sides?

812
01:05:13.702 --> 01:05:14.745
What if it was you

813
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:17.080
who wasn't seeing them before?

814
01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:19.541
- No. that's not how it is.

815
01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:22.085
I'm going back.
and I'm going now.

816
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.462
- It's too soon.

817
01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:46.443
- Hey. where's my bike. huh?

818
01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.028
- I washed it in the river.

819
01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:50.572
- No. No!

820
01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:51.907
- Yes. sucker.

821
01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:54.534
- Now. now. boys.
Let's play nice.

822
01:05:56.161 --> 01:05:57.829
Guest of honor's here.

823
01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.999
- Savannah. what have
they done to you?

824
01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:03.460
- Look how beautiful
we made you.

825
01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:06.546
- No. she was beautiful before.

826
01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:08.548
Now. she's just
like all the others.

827
01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:25.816
- Violet! Violet. please.

828
01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:29.194
Where are you?

829
01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.435
- Uh.

830
01:07:41.183 --> 01:07:43.643
- Savannah. we want
you to join us.

831
01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.605
Become a member of our family.

832
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.567
Do you accept?

833
01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:56.072
- Yes.

834
01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:32.692
- You know what to do.

835
01:09:55.442 --> 01:10:00.405
Now let's show
ourselves to the world.

836
01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:29.184
Go on.

837
01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:05.905
- Ladies and gentlemen.

838
01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:11.286
I want to welcome all of
you extraordinary people.

839
01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:16.374
You are the first to experience
the Paradiso collection.

840
01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:21.921
And now. I give you
the incomparable Yana.

841
01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:41.149
- I love beauty.

842
01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:45.153
Beautiful bodies.
beautiful clothes.

843
01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:47.113
and beautiful lives.

844
01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:50.033
So may I present to you

845
01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:52.660
my beautiful birds of paradise

846
01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:56.956
and my new
collection?

847
01:14:16.995 --> 01:14:17.787
- Violeta.

848
01:14:23.668 --> 01:14:28.631
Violeta! Violeta!

849
01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:32.844
Violeta.

850
01:14:34.429 --> 01:14:37.056
- Daniele. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

851
01:14:40.268 --> 01:14:41.811
- It doesn't matter.

852
01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:46.024
Are you okay? What happened?

853
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.983
- I'm fine.

854
01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:50.278
- Come on. I take
you to the hotel.

855
01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:54.991
- No. wait. there's
this door in the forest.

856
01:14:55.116 --> 01:14:57.076
I gotta get to it
before sun comes up.

857
01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:00.663
- Maybe you hit
your head on a rock.

858
01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:01.998
- No. I didn't.

859
01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.001
Just trust me.

860
01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:08.755
Just. please. Just trust me.

861
01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:12.050
Just trust me.

862
01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.472
Okay.

863
01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:19.307
- Wait. wait. what happened?

864
01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:20.767
Have you seen Savannah?

865
01:15:20.892 --> 01:15:23.269
- Yes. I did. She's
one of them now.

866
01:15:23.394 --> 01:15:24.354
- No. mm. she isn't.

867
01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:27.023
We have to save her.

868
01:15:28.316 --> 01:15:30.568
- Don't you worry. We're family.

869
01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:37.075
- Yeah.

870
01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:24.872
- Where is Savannah?

871
01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.668
Where is Savannah?

872
01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:31.838
- They took her to a room.

873
01:16:31.963 --> 01:16:32.714
- Where?

874
01:16:44.976 --> 01:16:47.937
Time to
decide. Savannah.

875
01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:51.065
Are you ready?

876
01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.276
Ready to take your
career to the next level?

877
01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.364
- She's ready. I can tell.

878
01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.161
- Savannah? Savannah?

879
01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:06.289
Violeta.

880
01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:07.707
What are you
doing with my sister?

881
01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:10.001
- Waiting for you. darling.

882
01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.502
You took your time.

883
01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.463
but I'm happy that
you're finally here.

884
01:17:13.588 --> 01:17:15.340
- Yes. but this. this dress.

885
01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:16.883
I mean. Mamma mia.

886
01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:18.343
We'll get her something
much better. I promise.

887
01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:20.511
Not you.

888
01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:22.180
- Savannah? Are you okay?

889
01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:24.515
- What are you
doing? It's too late.

890
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.559
She's one of us.

891
01:17:26.684 --> 01:17:28.895
- Come on. we're gonna have
so much fun. I promise.

892
01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:30.521
What do you say. Violeta?

893
01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:34.317
- But hey. you're
always welcome to join.

894
01:17:35.902 --> 01:17:36.778
- Savannah. I'm
taking you home now.

895
01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:38.321
It's okay. It's okay.

896
01:17:38.446 --> 01:17:39.238
They're
both coming with me.

897
01:17:39.364 --> 01:17:40.698
- No. they're not.

898
01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:44.702
Now clear out!

899
01:17:46.537 --> 01:17:47.288
- I love you.

900
01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:50.500
- Oh God.

901
01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:51.626
- Love you.

902
01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:05.598
- Okay. let's get out of here.

903
01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:07.141
- What? Savannah?

904
01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:08.684
- What are you? What?

905
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:09.894
What the hell

906
01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:11.020
did you do?
- I'm clear.

907
01:18:11.145 --> 01:18:12.355
- Franco. forget the camera.

908
01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.439
- I'll kill you!
Look what he did!

909
01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.316
Stop!

910
01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:17.527
- Now you're dead!

911
01:18:20.405 --> 01:18:23.449
Franco!

912
01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:27.787
Oh God.

913
01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:30.415
Come on.

914
01:19:42.028 --> 01:19:42.987
- Savannah!

915
01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:44.363
Hey!

916
01:19:45.490 --> 01:19:46.532
Savannah.

917
01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:47.408
- Daniele!

918
01:19:50.495 --> 01:19:52.371
Daniele. Daniele.

919
01:19:52.497 --> 01:19:54.790
- Violet. where are you guys?

920
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:05.343
- Daniele.

921
01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:25.154
- Please. this is crazy.

922
01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:26.656
Why is she so special?

923
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.908
- She has my key.

924
01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:30.076
- Your what?

925
01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:31.577
- Let's go. move!

926
01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:42.380
- Whoa! What is that?

927
01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:43.589
- Don't just stand there!

928
01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:44.549
Stab it! Kill it!

929
01:20:44.674 --> 01:20:45.550
- Are. are you kidding?

930
01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:47.802
- No. do it. Now.

931
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.472
- Shoo! Go away!

932
01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:56.435
- Ooh. I'm so
scared. I'm shaking.

933
01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:58.646
- Look. final warning.

934
01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:01.774
- Careful. I'll kill
you with my eyes.

935
01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:05.903
- You know what? I'm done.

936
01:21:07.113 --> 01:21:08.447
This is your problem.

937
01:21:08.573 --> 01:21:09.532
Not mine!
- Franco.

938
01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:10.449
Franco. get back here now!

939
01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:16.664
I hate you.

940
01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:19.417
- I know. You fear
the me in you.

941
01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:24.463
Which is why you can
never have the key.

942
01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:28.426
Paradiso is mine
to give. remember?

943
01:21:28.551 --> 01:21:30.595
- To that little brat?

944
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.513
I'll just destroy her.

945
01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:34.599
And then you'll fade to dust.

946
01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:37.059
And my Inferno
will live forever.

947
01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.981
- Live forever?
You're already dead.

948
01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:45.693
And you just can't see it!

949
01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:46.861
No!

950
01:21:46.986 --> 01:21:48.029
You're the one that's dead!

951
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:18.517
Would
you even recognize me?

952
01:22:18.643 --> 01:22:23.522
I wonder.

953
01:22:36.077 --> 01:22:38.871
No. no.

954
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.389
You've got
to make it to the plug

955
01:23:38.514 --> 01:23:41.225
before sunrise tomorrow morning.

956
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.601
- No. no. no. no.

957
01:24:11.297 --> 01:24:12.047
Oh. great.

958
01:24:17.845 --> 01:24:19.513
- I've got you now.

959
01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:23.100
What do you want?

960
01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:26.812
- You. darling. It's
always been you.

961
01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:27.688
- Never.

962
01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:55.758
- Fine. New offer.

963
01:24:57.426 --> 01:25:01.555
I let you go if
you give me that.

964
01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.224
- What? This?

965
01:25:07.937 --> 01:25:10.272
Fine. take it

966
01:25:11.649 --> 01:25:13.776
if you leave me. Savannah.

967
01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:15.694
and Daniele alone forever.

968
01:25:17.238 --> 01:25:17.988
- Deal.

969
01:25:20.491 --> 01:25:21.408
I promise.

970
01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:30.918
You silly. silly little girl.

971
01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:33.462
You've just given me
the key. which means...

972
01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:41.220
Why?

973
01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:48.102
You.

974
01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:55.693
- Want to try again?

975
01:25:55.818 --> 01:25:56.819
- It's not a toy.

976
01:25:56.944 --> 01:25:58.112
you stupid. stupid little girl.

977
01:25:58.237 --> 01:25:59.780
No. it's mine!

978
01:26:02.783 --> 01:26:04.326
What? What are you...

979
01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:06.787
Mother! You're
supposed to. stop!

980
01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.290
Ah. no!

981
01:27:26.492 --> 01:27:29.787
- Hazel!

982
01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:30.913
Hello?

983
01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:43.717
Hazel! Hazel.

984
01:28:26.343 --> 01:28:28.762
- I knew you'd do well.

985
01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:29.638
- Hazel.

986
01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:36.645
Thank you. I didn't make it.

987
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:39.064
I'm stuck on the side forever.

988
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:40.899
- Well. that's one
way of looking at it.

989
01:28:44.028 --> 01:28:46.071
You reached it after all.

990
01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:52.953
Life can be just as
magical with this garden.

991
01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:54.913
Only it's a lot more fun.

992
01:29:02.921 --> 01:29:04.590
Violeta!

993
01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:08.927
Violeta!

994
01:29:09.053 --> 01:29:09.928
- Daniele!

995
01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.098
Ciao.

996
01:29:14.016 --> 01:29:15.476
- Ciao.

997
01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.274
So you decide to stay?

998
01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:23.150
- Mm-hmm.

999
01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:29.281
Where's Savannah?

1000
01:29:29.406 --> 01:29:30.574
- Let's go.

1001
01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:39.917
- Savannah? Savannah!

1002
01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:41.585
