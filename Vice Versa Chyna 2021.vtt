I vividly recall seeing Chyna

At the time.
I was the character Mankind

8

and not too many people
knew what I looked like.

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:27.128
I'd sit out in the crowd with my
family and not get bothered

Terri Runnels like a rag doll.

"Oh. my God.

Terri Runnels apart."

Who is that person?

Through the arena. I saw her
and I went. "Holy cow!

the first time I saw Joanie.

And anybody else
that steps in that ring

36

to leave them behind me

513
00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:35.789
but I didn't really know
that professional wrestling

514
00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:38.458
was pretty much Vince McMahon.

515
00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:41.628
Vince McMahon is part desperado.
part tycoon.

516
00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:43.463
and all showman.

517
00:22:43.487 --> 00:22:45.757
He's the founder of the
World Wrestling Federation

518
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:47.634
and the man responsible for some

519
00:22:47.658 --> 00:22:50.262
of the most controversial
television programing ever.

Announcer:
The Godfather

524
00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:04.568
{\an8}Vince McMahon is brilliant

525
00:23:04.592 --> 00:23:07.654
{\an8}and he's stubborn

526
00:23:07.678 --> 00:23:09.447
{\an8}and he's a man's man.

527
00:23:09.471 --> 00:23:14.160
I would do anything
for you. Mr. McMahon.

528
00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:16.454
I've heard many times.
and Joanie had even

529
00:23:16.478 --> 00:23:18.707
told me this... that Vince
didn't like the big girls.

530
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.417
He didn't like her look.

531
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:24.379
He didn't want that in WWE.

532
00:23:24.403 --> 00:23:26.506
{\an8}When her role as my bodyguard

533
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.425
{\an8}was first being brought up
to Vince.

534
00:23:28.449 --> 00:23:29.884
{\an8}it was heavily resisted.

535
00:23:29.908 --> 00:23:31.511
"No one's going
to believe in that

536
00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:32.971
and no one's going to buy it."
and Shawn and I had

537
00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:36.141
to push really hard
to get that done.

538
00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:38.351
I want the guys.
but I'm going to be the first.

539
00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:40.103
the biggest. the baddest.

540
00:23:40.127 --> 00:23:43.732
the new role model.
for female wrestlers. got that?

541
00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:45.567
[ Crying ]
She called me and said.

542
00:23:45.591 --> 00:23:50.113
"They've accepted me
and I'm going to be Chyna."

543
00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:51.865
{\an8}♪♪

544
00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:54.242
Chyna:
Triple H and Shawn Michaels
liked "Chyna."

545
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.119
They thought that
it was kind of an oxymoron.

546
00:23:56.143 --> 00:23:59.205
It represented this tiny.
petite china item

547
00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:02.125
and I was so opposite from that.

548
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:03.460
Announcer:
And his opponent.

549
00:24:03.484 --> 00:24:06.254

to the ring by Chyna.

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:07.756
Hunter Hearst!

551
00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.884
{\an8}Kathy:
She just kind of hit pay dirt.

552
00:24:10.908 --> 00:24:13.053
{\an8}I think she was in shock.

553
00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:16.056
20.213 fans.

554
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.185
To be thrust into the limelight
like that. overnight.

555
00:24:20.209 --> 00:24:21.519
she went from being at home

556
00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:24.439
to being on the road
<i>immediately.</i>

557
00:24:24.463 --> 00:24:26.650
Gerry:
From the first time
she started going on the road.

558
00:24:26.674 --> 00:24:28.485
she was with Paul.

559
00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:31.112
Ten days at a time.
home for two days.

560
00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:32.989
I know she was coming home

561
00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:36.242
and staying with him
for a couple of days.

562
00:24:36.266 --> 00:24:38.286
Chyna:
We really gravitated
towards each other

563
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.580
and became very serious
with each other

564
00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:42.624
six months later.

565
00:24:42.648 --> 00:24:44.167
Gerry:
I knew I had to let her go.

566
00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:46.711
to go off and do
what she wanted to do.

567
00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:48.838
I needed to not be selfish.

568
00:24:48.862 --> 00:24:50.674
She needed to go be famous.

570
00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:55.720
{\an7}Right in the kidneys!

571
00:24:55.744 --> 00:24:59.391
I remember putting together
the original DX.

572
00:24:59.415 --> 00:25:02.143
Obviously.
Hunter brought Chyna in

573
00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:03.436
because he wanted
to do something with him.

574
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.689
Hunter and Sean were friends.

575
00:25:05.713 --> 00:25:09.734
and all of a sudden we had this
threesome known as DX.

576
00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:13.822
- Triple threat no way through.
- The show stoppers!

577
00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:18.368
Russo:
As the head writer of the show.
DX had a very big part.

578
00:25:18.392 --> 00:25:22.330
They had to be cool.
they had to be cutting edge.

579
00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.290
Diesel: At that time.
it was the attitude era.

580
00:25:24.314 --> 00:25:29.796
{\an8}So everything was. you know.
about that to the man.

581
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.423
The stuff before
the attitude era.

582
00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:34.759
if you look very low key.
very. I would say.

583
00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:37.011
probably less than PG.

584
00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:39.639
but then once the attitude era
hit. it was all on.

585
00:25:39.663 --> 00:25:42.475
Let's get rid of this sucker!

586
00:25:42.499 --> 00:25:45.812
{\an8}♪♪

587
00:25:45.836 --> 00:25:49.733
Joanie finally
had found a family.

588
00:25:49.757 --> 00:25:52.527
Now she's got a couple
of dozen brothers

589
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.237
that would
take a bullet for her.

590
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:56.614
Diesel: What they were was
the Generation X. you know.

591
00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:58.616
So. I mean. that just fit.

592
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.437
Like we're such badasses.
our cooler is a female.

593
00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:08.668
On top of it. you're buying it.

594
00:26:08.692 --> 00:26:13.339
{\an8}This is a new beginning for
D-Generation X.

595
00:26:13.363 --> 00:26:15.508
{\an8}And we're here to rip ass!

596
00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:19.304
{\an8}When I first met Chyna
while she was with Hunter.

597
00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:21.347
Chyna was somebody that
doesn't drink

598
00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:23.558
or do drugs
or anything like that.

599
00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:25.643
And the rest of us.
after the show.

600
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:28.646
all we did was drink
and do take pills.

601
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.273
And I would be
traveling with them.

602
00:26:30.297 --> 00:26:33.193
And. you know. Hunter
and Chyna's relationships.

603
00:26:33.217 --> 00:26:36.553
seemed good. like.
on the surface.

604
00:26:38.555 --> 00:26:42.160
Joanie and Triple H were
together for quite a while.

605
00:26:42.184 --> 00:26:44.162
Joanie was loyal to him.
she loved him.

606
00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:46.664
She was very much
in love with him.

607
00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:49.667
Hamilton:
I remember the first time
they walked into my house.

608
00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:52.587
{\an8}it was almost bigger than life.

609
00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:54.947
{\an8}But they were perfect together.

610
00:26:56.698 --> 00:27:01.513
I think he loved her
just the way she was.

611
00:27:01.537 --> 00:27:05.141
{\an1}Man: Honestly. was Hunter
the love of your life?

612
00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:08.812
Very much so. I was very. very
much in love with him. Yes.

613
00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:12.774
{\an8}Russo:
I don't think it was a secret
that they were together.

614
00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:17.111
{\an8}I think people were just taken
back that somebody like Paul.

615
00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:19.489
for whatever reason.
would choose

616
00:27:19.513 --> 00:27:24.244
to have a relationship
with somebody like Chyna.

617
00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:27.831
She got a lot of flack
for the way that she looked.

618
00:27:27.855 --> 00:27:29.457
not just because she was huge.

619
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:33.127
but because she had
a certain sense of masculinity

620
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:36.673
and the fans love to hate her.

621
00:27:36.697 --> 00:27:39.384
Put it down on her knees
where she belongs.

622
00:27:39.408 --> 00:27:42.011
Man: Oh. come on.

623
00:27:42.035 --> 00:27:45.723
Russo:
I've definitely seen pressure
of losing weight.

624
00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:49.310
getting implants.
taking steroids.

625
00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:53.147
I've seen that way
too many times.

626
00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:56.818
Hamilton: She definitely wanted
to have more of a feminine
appeal.

627
00:27:56.842 --> 00:27:58.570
And I think that she felt

628
00:27:58.594 --> 00:28:02.365
that the only way she could do
that was surgically.

629
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:05.118
Man:
You had your jaw reconstructed
to look more like a woman.

630
00:28:05.142 --> 00:28:06.411
True or false?
- Now. what is that all about?

631
00:28:06.435 --> 00:28:08.997
I had reconstructive
surgery on my jaw

632
00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:10.874
for an underbite that I had.

633
00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:14.711
{\an1}Oh. I see. So it isn't about you
looking more like a woman?

634
00:28:14.735 --> 00:28:16.629
No.

635
00:28:16.653 --> 00:28:19.465
Hamilton: I think she felt like
that was the last piece

636
00:28:19.489 --> 00:28:21.718
that she had to take care of

637
00:28:21.742 --> 00:28:25.513
{\an8}in order to get to
a sense of self acceptance.

638
00:28:25.537 --> 00:28:28.016
{\an8}that not only was she big
and strong and muscular.

639
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.896
{\an8}but that she was very feminine
and could be sexy.

640
00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.731
{\an8}Chyna: I think I display
an enormous amount

641
00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:36.816
{\an8}of femininity. opportunity.
And I happen to be...

642
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.610
{\an1}Oh. yeah. I'm not saying that
but the look is one of...

643
00:28:38.634 --> 00:28:40.069
{\an3}The look is strength.

644
00:28:40.093 --> 00:28:41.905
And I think to me.
what it demonstrates...

645
00:28:41.929 --> 00:28:44.157
"Strength" is a male word.
A male word.

646
00:28:44.181 --> 00:28:46.034
Strength is a male word
because I think that

647
00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:47.577
women are afraid
to show strength

648
00:28:47.601 --> 00:28:50.705
because they get
chastised for it.

649
00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:54.334
And society
likes beautiful women.

650
00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:57.295
And so she did
what she needed to do.

651
00:28:57.319 --> 00:29:01.382
That's kind of when her career
just sort of skyrocketed.

652
00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:04.385
Well. well. well.
what do you know?

653
00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:08.890
The opportunity to talk?

654
00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:12.060
Because that's what it's all
about. guys. right. opportunity.

655
00:29:12.084 --> 00:29:17.815
DX wanted to get ahead.
you know how they did it? Me.

656
00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:20.360
I was the force behind DX.

657
00:29:20.384 --> 00:29:23.154
because I carried those
four degenerates on my back

658
00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:24.656
for almost two years.

659
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.658
Announcer:
Chyna has grabbed Gillberg

660
00:29:26.682 --> 00:29:30.828
and is now beating the daylights
out of him all the way out.

661
00:29:30.852 --> 00:29:33.873
{\an1}Man: At what point did you
realize how big you had gotten?

662
00:29:33.897 --> 00:29:35.458
{\an3}You know. there was no more DX

663
00:29:35.482 --> 00:29:38.503
{\an3}and they wanted me
to wrestle by myself.

664
00:29:38.527 --> 00:29:40.380
{\an3}I didn't want to do it.

665
00:29:40.404 --> 00:29:43.049
They were like. no. no. we want
to go this direction with you.

666
00:29:43.073 --> 00:29:44.509
Terry. I've never seen

667
00:29:44.533 --> 00:29:46.219
the Ninth Wonder of the World
so intense.

668
00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:48.388
{\an3}I was the one who thought.
"That's not going to work."

669
00:29:48.412 --> 00:29:51.683
She has earned the right
to be the number one contender.

670
00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:56.896
I was always under an enormous
amount of pressure

671
00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.733
to be perfect and not screw up.

672
00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:02.276
Man #2: What'd she have to do
to win a match?

673
00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.821
You cannot have
an inter gender match

674
00:30:04.845 --> 00:30:06.322
if it's not believable.

675
00:30:06.346 --> 00:30:10.451
The beauty with Chyna
was it was believable.

676
00:30:10.475 --> 00:30:13.538
Men are dominant
and women are weak!

677
00:30:13.562 --> 00:30:17.875
{\an8}Joanie was the one
who seemed most likely to win

678
00:30:17.899 --> 00:30:21.546
{\an8}an intercontinental
championship from a man.

679
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:23.548
Like. that was
completely believable.

680
00:30:23.572 --> 00:30:24.966
Announcer:
Chyna's got the guitar.

681
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.634
- Look out!
- Oh. man!

682
00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:29.095
Announcer:
Chyna with a guitar!

683
00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:31.389
- [Indistinct speech]
- It certainly is.

684
00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:32.890
I guess it is.
I don't know.

685
00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:34.434
Announcer #2:
We have a K.O.

686
00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:37.103
[ Cheers and applause ]

687
00:30:37.127 --> 00:30:43.151
Announcer #3: The new World
Welter Weight Title. Chyna!

688
00:30:43.175 --> 00:30:45.653
Announcer #2:
Chyna has made history!

689
00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:50.575
Chyna. the first woman to become
the Intercontinental Champion!

690
00:30:50.599 --> 00:30:52.785
Chyna: After that. it was like
just like this phenomena

691
00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:57.373
of the magazine covers
and all the interviews.

692
00:30:57.397 --> 00:31:00.543
And then I became kind of
like more of a spokesperson

693
00:31:00.567 --> 00:31:05.631
for the WWE to being this
female phenom.

694
00:31:05.655 --> 00:31:09.469
I felt like it was
expanding the business.

695
00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:11.721
We could just feel it
starting to grow.

696
00:31:11.745 --> 00:31:14.307
Didn't know anything
about wrestling

697
00:31:14.331 --> 00:31:19.687
and I see this video
and here was this gorgeous woman

698
00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:24.317
coming out onstage
in this silver costume

699
00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:28.362
And I'm like.
"Wow. is that Joanie?!"

700
00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:32.533
{\an8}I mean. I knew it was.
but it was like. "Wow!"

701
00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.160
{\an8}That just was like [ Gasp ]

702
00:31:34.184 --> 00:31:37.747
{\an8}It's kind of really surprising.

703
00:31:37.771 --> 00:31:41.751
I mean. you know.
there's your kid onstage.

704
00:31:41.775 --> 00:31:44.486
I hadn't heard from her
for almost 27 years.

705
00:31:48.156 --> 00:31:51.677
{\an8}♪♪

706
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:55.807
{\an8}Yeah. man. that that trip. like
we within the first week.

707
00:31:55.831 --> 00:31:57.809
{\an8}like we all saw sort of
our true colors.

708
00:31:57.833 --> 00:31:59.894
{\an8}Chyna. did you remember Eddie?

709
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:02.814
{\an8}- Hey. Eddie.
- Oh. my God.

710
00:32:02.838 --> 00:32:05.608
And I felt like Anthony was
treating me like a cameraman.

711
00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:07.777
It was my film
and I was paying for it.

712
00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:10.238
- I'll come in with...
- And he was like.

713
00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:12.031
"Go over here
and shoot this and shoot that."

714
00:32:12.055 --> 00:32:13.825
And there was a couple of times
that he didn't get his way

715
00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:15.660
and he yelled. we found out
he was the kind of person

716
00:32:15.684 --> 00:32:17.578
who was very calm and shill.

717
00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.372
But then when he would get to a
certain point. he would yell.

718
00:32:19.396 --> 00:32:21.082
Angra: Sorry. man.
we gotta do the asphalt.

719
00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:23.543
otherwise we're gonna
lose light.

720
00:32:23.567 --> 00:32:25.670
Okay. well. we've I think al...
Did we...?

721
00:32:25.694 --> 00:32:27.797
Oh. we're starting
that all over again.

722
00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:30.049
Angra:
And so he started yelling again
after we spent the whole day

723
00:32:30.073 --> 00:32:32.093
filming these things that I feel
were important.

724
00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:33.886
And then he starts yelling about
how important this guy is

725
00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.513
for Chyna's career.

726
00:32:35.537 --> 00:32:37.140
And then I got really pissed
and I just started

727
00:32:37.164 --> 00:32:38.891
screaming at him and I said.
like this was my show

728
00:32:38.915 --> 00:32:40.977
and him and Chyna could

729
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:42.603
go... themselves
and I didn't need them.

730
00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:46.023
I start throwing his stuff
out of the van. my van.

731
00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:50.069
and and then he apologized
and everything was cool.

732
00:32:50.093 --> 00:32:53.305
And that was the beginning of
like all of our relationships.

733
00:32:55.182 --> 00:32:58.661
{\an8}All of our characters
are a little bit of ourselves.

734
00:32:58.685 --> 00:33:02.623
Chyna is a powerful.
strong woman.

735
00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:05.376
She's attractive
and she holds her own

736
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.670
in male-dominated environment.

737
00:33:07.694 --> 00:33:11.883
{\an8}She was a household name.
She was just everywhere.

738
00:33:11.907 --> 00:33:19.098
It was an inundation of Chyna.

739
00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:20.892
She did the <i>Playboy </i>thing.

740
00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:22.935
Chyna: When I did my <i>Playboy.
</i>I made more money

741
00:33:22.959 --> 00:33:25.938
doing one <i>Playboy
</i>than I had in five years

742
00:33:25.962 --> 00:33:29.275
cumulatively of working
for the company.

743
00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:32.320
Hamilton:
She did feel a lot of insecurity
because she'd say.

744
00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:36.282
"Oh. my God. I just do not fit
in with these beautiful women."

745
00:33:36.306 --> 00:33:38.534
But they all thought
she was awesome.

746
00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:41.537
Chyna:
If you do happen to pick up
an issue of <i>Playboy</i>

747
00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:44.290
after you see my ass.
you can kiss it. too.

748
00:33:44.314 --> 00:33:46.417
[ Laughter ]
[ Cheers and applause ]

749
00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:51.172
{\an8}Eddie Guerrero and coming by
Mamacita for the title...

750
00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:53.883
{\an8}Landsberg:
You wanted storylines that
involved you wrestling men.

751
00:33:53.907 --> 00:33:56.427
{\an8}right.
and Vince. for the most part.

752
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:57.803
wanted you to wrestle
against women.

753
00:33:57.827 --> 00:33:59.847
{\an1}was that at the heart
of one of the problems?

754
00:33:59.871 --> 00:34:02.600
Yeah. my character was going
backwards.

755
00:34:02.624 --> 00:34:06.520
For six years. I had wrestled
men and then all of a sudden

756
00:34:06.544 --> 00:34:08.522
I wasn't supposed to fight
the guys anymore

757
00:34:08.546 --> 00:34:10.816
and I was supposed to be
this women's champion.

758
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.109
And who was I going to fight as
and what was I going to do?

759
00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:14.362
But is it possible
that the public

760
00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:18.241
does not want to see
men losing to women?

761
00:34:18.265 --> 00:34:20.451
Yeah. but there was
nobody there at that point

762
00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:22.119
that didn't want to wrestle me.

763
00:34:22.143 --> 00:34:24.288
How was I going to step
backwards and wrestle women

764
00:34:24.312 --> 00:34:25.790
that didn't have the experience

765
00:34:25.814 --> 00:34:29.585
from the guys
that I was wrestling everyday?

766
00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:31.837
Simpson: They're taking this
woman. 5'9".

767
00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:34.966
muscular
and turning her into a Diva.

768
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:38.386
Although they couldn't chisel
her down into a 5'5"

769
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:43.123
size 2 they did the best
they could to make her a Diva.

770
00:34:44.999 --> 00:34:46.519
{\an8}Strauch: I mean.
it seems like a big turning

771
00:34:46.543 --> 00:34:49.021
{\an8}point in her story.
- I think that was it.

772
00:34:49.045 --> 00:34:52.692
She's so full of everything
that you want to be around

773
00:34:52.716 --> 00:34:55.027
to somebody that just I would.

774
00:34:55.051 --> 00:34:59.323
in a sense.
completely goes dark.

775
00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:03.160
Joanie was all about trusting
people being loyal.

776
00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:05.413
In pro wrestling
you don't have that.

777
00:35:05.437 --> 00:35:08.124
Shame on Triple H.
He broke her heart.

778
00:35:08.148 --> 00:35:12.962
There's no other way to say
that he broke Joanie's heart.

779
00:35:12.986 --> 00:35:18.259
We had a huge house
in New Hampshire.

780
00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:19.844
His career was moving up

781
00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:23.597
and therefore
he was having a lot of meetings

782
00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:28.168
{\an8}with Vince and Stephanie
and like the crew there.

783
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.482
You know. I should not be
like the jealous like wifey

784
00:35:33.506 --> 00:35:36.485
and get on his case
about being too friendly

785
00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:38.321
with the boss's daughter
or with the boss.

786
00:35:38.345 --> 00:35:42.325
just let him do his thing.
I was so proud of him.

787
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:44.243
Stephanie:
By the time. you know.
Triple H and I started our

788
00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:46.912
{\an8}on-screen storyline.
we just sort of had

789
00:35:46.936 --> 00:35:50.041
{\an8}great chemistry
and it just went from there.

790
00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:54.086
Hunter I take thee
as my husband.

791
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.047
Our storyline was. you know.
that we were married

792
00:35:56.071 --> 00:36:00.426
and we took over the business
and drove my dad out.

793
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.511
One time when when I was
standing around the ring.

794
00:36:02.535 --> 00:36:03.929
he sort of curled around me.

795
00:36:03.953 --> 00:36:05.723
He was on the floor
and he felt my leg.

796
00:36:05.747 --> 00:36:08.267
And I was like.
that's definitely flirtation.

797
00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:10.519
Woman:
That's not part of the script.

798
00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:12.688
Chyna: I would ask Hunter
time and time again.

799
00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:15.566
I figured it's better
just to address the problem

800
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:16.901
and ask him honestly.

801
00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:19.653
So we got into
a heated argument.

802
00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:22.198
I told him.
I know something's going on.

803
00:36:22.222 --> 00:36:24.658
Don't tell me
something's not going on.

804
00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:28.579
He swiped my hand.
I swiped his hand.

805
00:36:28.603 --> 00:36:30.998
I knew at that point
I had to leave.

806
00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:33.876
but I needed
some sort of closure.

807
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.629
And I found a love letter
from Stephanie

808
00:36:36.653 --> 00:36:38.297
that had dated a year back.

809
00:36:38.321 --> 00:36:40.800
So the whole time
they were doing the storyline.

810
00:36:40.824 --> 00:36:43.886
basically they were together.

811
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:47.014
When I found out
I was devastated. It hurt me.

812
00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:50.393
I'm a human being and nobody.
whether you're a celebrity

813
00:36:50.417 --> 00:36:52.436
or whether you're not.
likes to be cheated on.

814
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.356
especially when it's with
the boss's daughter.

815
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.316
- It's Vince's daughter.
- Sure.

816
00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.402
- As long as you keep her happy.
- It's a hell of a cash upgrade.

817
00:36:59.426 --> 00:37:01.487
- And also. she's very feminine.
- Right.

818
00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:03.823
I mean. you would call her
a feminine woman.

819
00:37:03.847 --> 00:37:05.074
Woman:
Certainly not like Joan.

820
00:37:05.098 --> 00:37:06.575
Hamilton:
I think when she met him.

821
00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:09.203
she found somebody
that she really loved.

822
00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:13.040
And I think she was devastated
when that relationship ended.

823
00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:15.459
Chyna: Love can't stop love.

824
00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:17.711
But I was like.
how then do I deal with

825
00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:20.423
the emotional side
of this happening

826
00:37:20.447 --> 00:37:25.845
and keeping my job
and. like. moving forward?

827
00:37:25.869 --> 00:37:28.597
{\an8}Tell me whether your
relationship with Triple H

828
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:30.516
{\an8}and now his relationship
with Stephanie

829
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.310
{\an8}sped up your departure
from the WWF?

830
00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:37.481
Well. officially. you know.
I could say no.

831
00:37:37.505 --> 00:37:40.860
but I don't think I'll ever know
the answer to that.

832
00:37:40.884 --> 00:37:44.822
In the back of my mind.
I'd like to say. "Of course."

833
00:37:44.846 --> 00:37:48.951
Ross: Well. we decided
not to renew her contract.

834
00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:54.415
{\an8}Her deal to me was
Chyna is as valuable to WWE

835
00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:57.835
{\an8}as Stone Cold Steve Austin is.

836
00:37:57.859 --> 00:38:01.046
Chyna: Because I did feel
that I was top talent there.

837
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.008
And I was included
in every other aspect

838
00:38:04.032 --> 00:38:06.343
as far as top talent
was concerned.

839
00:38:06.367 --> 00:38:09.138
except for financially.

840
00:38:09.162 --> 00:38:12.641
Ross:
She wanted to be cut loose
or she would've demanded

841
00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:14.768
a million dollars a year.

{\an8}there's always the excuse.

845

{\an8}Oh. they got too big
for their ego.

846
00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:30.826
They they got hard to deal with.
They wanted more money.

847
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.204
Out of the thousands
and thousands of people

848
00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:37.333

the last one to have an ego

849

every right to have an ego.

Chyna: I was sitting in a
Jerry's Deli eating lunch

851
00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:48.969
and a fax mysteriously went
to Jerry's Deli

852
00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:50.596
and it was from the WWE

853
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:54.725
and they said they wouldn't
be needing me anymore.

It's something that the company
is actually very good at doing.

855

and they did it with Joanie.
which is that

856
00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:01.815
once she was let go.

857
00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:04.175

completely erased.

about the wrestling

I love them for making me Chyna.

862

{\an1}Man: Did they make you Chyna.
or did you make you Chyna?

863

Both. Both.

achieve that again.

at the point of asking yourself.

871

{\an8}what's my purpose?

872
00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:07.590
{\an8}Hamilton:
When she left the WWE.

873
00:40:07.614 --> 00:40:10.491
{\an8}she got an apartment
out in Santa Monica.

874
00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:17.224
{\an8}She went from having that family
at the WWE to really

875
00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.310
{\an8}being on her own.

876
00:40:19.334 --> 00:40:23.772
Chyna:
Nobody would take my call.
nobody would answer my letters.

877
00:40:23.796 --> 00:40:26.400
Literally pulled the rug out
from underneath me

878
00:40:26.424 --> 00:40:28.027
because I went from.

879
00:40:28.051 --> 00:40:32.573
like this billion dollar
commodity right on the street.

880
00:40:32.597 --> 00:40:34.908
Hamilton: She could no longer
use
the Chyna name.

881
00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:37.411
That name was owned by the WWE.

882
00:40:37.435 --> 00:40:39.913
When she left.
she had to give it up.

883
00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:42.750
{\an1}Stern: Course. we can't call her
"Chyna" or else she'll be sued.

884
00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:44.918
That's right.
That's Vince McMahon's name.

885
00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:48.213
But we could use
officially Chyna Doll.

886
00:40:48.237 --> 00:40:50.007
Right.
You're Chyna Doll.

887
00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:52.301
Right. Joanie Chyna Doll Laurer.

888
00:40:52.325 --> 00:40:56.847
Russo: If I'm Vince McMahon.
I own that brand.

889
00:40:56.871 --> 00:41:00.851
but can we make an exception?

890
00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:03.395
Let her use her name.

891
00:41:03.419 --> 00:41:07.924
But that that that would
ultimately come from Vince.

892
00:41:10.343 --> 00:41:14.281
I assumed that I would just deal
with the heartache

893
00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:16.784
of the breakup
and make a like a lateral move.

894
00:41:16.808 --> 00:41:19.161
{\an1}so I went knocking on doors
in Hollywood and I thought.

895
00:41:19.185 --> 00:41:21.538
{\an1}oh. I'll get a sitcom
or I'll get another show.

896
00:41:21.562 --> 00:41:23.332
{\an8}Chyna: I got three big movies
coming out.

897
00:41:23.356 --> 00:41:26.085
{\an8}One is "Just Another
Romantic Wrestling Comedy"

898
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:29.129
{\an8}where I actually do some
some of my last wrestling.

899
00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:33.926
{\an8}She had some other acting gigs.
nothing substantial.

900
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:35.469
{\an8}And I think at that point

901
00:41:35.493 --> 00:41:38.180
she kind of
started to panic a little bit.

902
00:41:38.204 --> 00:41:41.225
- It's going to hurt.
- Is there a point. Joanie.

903

you know.

904
00:41:43.876 --> 00:41:47.815

to get your head off

905
00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:52.152
of what you're going through
to ease the pain.

906
00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:54.571
Chyna: I found myself on the
bottom of a vodka bottle

907
00:41:54.595 --> 00:41:59.410
on many occasions.
I was self medicating for sure.

908
00:41:59.434 --> 00:42:04.873
Hamilton:
She was. again. feeling lonesome
and not sure what to do.

909
00:42:04.897 --> 00:42:08.168
That's when she became involved
with Sean.

910
00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.695
when he sort of
came into the picture.

911
00:42:13.364 --> 00:42:16.510
He showed up on my doorstep
one day and I was like.

912
00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:19.096
"Oh. my God. you know.
we've been friends for so long."

913
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.681
He said. "I got a divorce
from my wife"

914
00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:26.478
and he was happy to see me.
And it was instant love.

915
00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:29.565
{\an8}She was a very comforting

916
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:33.902
{\an8}and felt
like a safe place for me.

917
00:42:33.926 --> 00:42:36.238
Diesel: And she seemed
really comfortable.

918
00:42:36.262 --> 00:42:40.701
And I just got...
The two just kind of meshed.

919
00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:42.494
But I think at the same time.

920
00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:44.913
{\an8}those two weren't good
for each other.

921
00:42:44.937 --> 00:42:48.709
X-Pac: I just was happy
to have somebody that wanted me.

922
00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:51.712
There's a bad person
in there somewhere

923
00:42:51.736 --> 00:42:56.759
and there's a... wonderful
person in there somewhere. too.

924
00:42:56.783 --> 00:42:59.011
{\an1}Chyna: It happened so quick.
That's when I started noticing

925
00:42:59.035 --> 00:43:00.471
{\an1}like a lot of the drugs

926
00:43:00.495 --> 00:43:02.222

stuff thinking like.

oh. my gosh. here we go again.

928
00:43:04.207 --> 00:43:05.851
I'm getting into
another situation.

929
00:43:05.875 --> 00:43:07.478
How do I deal with this?

930
00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:11.648
I just started dabbling in using
crystal meth at the time.

931
00:43:11.672 --> 00:43:14.651
I was hiding my drug use
from her.

932
00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:16.904
And I didn't realize at the time

933
00:43:16.928 --> 00:43:20.032
that she was hiding hers
from me as well.

934
00:43:20.056 --> 00:43:22.951
Hamilton:
It's almost like they were
on a boat that was sinking

935
00:43:22.975 --> 00:43:27.897
and there was not a lot anybody
could do to stop that.

936
00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:35.547
{\an8}Joanie found it incredibly
fascinating to go to Japan.

937
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:39.301
They had a different sort of
respect about wrestling there.

938
00:43:39.325 --> 00:43:41.345
When I was there in 2002.
wrestling was huge.

939
00:43:41.369 --> 00:43:42.930
within Ojisan.

940
00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:45.015
{\an3}That was with New Japan
Professional Wrestling.

941
00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:49.144
{\an8}Yasuda:
New Japan is the biggest pro
wrestling organization in Japan.

942
00:43:49.168 --> 00:43:52.064
{\an8}It was originally founded
by Mister Inoki.

943
00:43:52.088 --> 00:43:56.443
{\an8}And he's more like mix of a
Muhammad Ali and Vince McMahon.

you're getting beat up. right?
It's a scary world.

am the queen of denial.

1006
00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:24.878
{\an8}And so to talk about this
means that I have to admit

1007
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:27.506
{\an8}the fact that she had a lot of
problems

1008
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:32.969
{\an8}that I just could not...
Nobody could control. right?

1009
00:48:32.993 --> 00:48:36.932
{\an8}Sean called me and he said.
you need to get here now.

1010

and she was combative.

1011

{\an8}She was under the influence.
And I said. "I love you.

And I think you got to go
get help or you're gonna die."

1013
00:48:49.385 --> 00:48:51.947

"I don't have a problem."

1014

This went on for hours
and she finally agreed.

1016
00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.918
We got to the rehab
and we walked in the door

1017
00:49:04.942 --> 00:49:07.879
and Joanie said. "I don't know
what the... we're doing here.

1018
00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:11.883
but I'm out of here."
after like 10 or 15 minutes.

1019
00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:15.637
She basically was telling me
she hated me.

1020

to see me again.

1021

1023

and that was the last time
I saw her.

1024
00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:31.468
I was heartbroken.
She was my best friend.

1025

that she had for family.

1027

I slapped him in self defense.

1035
00:50:00.915 --> 00:50:04.311
Her relationship with Sean
was extremely toxic

1036
00:50:04.335 --> 00:50:07.606
because both individuals had
their own demons to deal with.

1037
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.650
And I think it's because
she was so desperate to be loved

1038
00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:12.485
that she would take
these relationships

1039

Laque: The major difficulty was
living with my husband.

1163
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:47.839
who was an alcoholic
and a drug addict.

1164
00:56:47.863 --> 00:56:54.012
She saw some pretty
raucous fights between us.

1165
00:56:54.036 --> 00:56:58.099
{\an1}There was an incident where Joe
stabbed me with a butcher knife.

I don't really know
how much effect it had on her.

Hamilton: Eventually. that
relationship ended permanently.

1168
00:57:05.464 --> 00:57:10.778
But I think there was probably
a lot of lasting impact

1169

very dysfunctional.

I would go get away from all
the yelling and screaming.

of separating myself.

1175

{\an8}I believe she would just say.
"I just wanted to be loved."

1176
00:57:37.788 --> 00:57:39.557
That's what she was
always searching for.

1177
00:57:39.581 --> 00:57:45.605
was the love and the approval
and the acceptance.

1178
00:57:45.629 --> 00:57:47.649
Maybe a couple of months
before her 16th birthday.

1179
00:57:47.673 --> 00:57:53.488
her personality really changed.
She was out of control.

1180
00:57:53.512 --> 00:57:55.990
I always thought
it was like the aliens came down

1181
00:57:56.014 --> 00:57:58.034
and snatched her.

1182
00:57:58.058 --> 00:58:00.286
And put a different personality
in her body

the same Joan anymore.

she was hanging around

that were using drugs.

have handled that

for her father.

some closure that I need.

and then two months later
he was a Hell's Angel.

So it was like that movie
"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels."

1322
01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:02.768
The first time we had contact

1323
01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:05.354
was when she called me
from Japan.

1324
01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.690
but it had been 30 years.

1325
01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:11.235
I couldn't believe it was her
and I'm like.

1326
01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:16.574
"Joanie. is that really you?"
She did most of the talking.

1327
01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:18.284
telling me about
her life in Japan

1328
01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:22.580
and what had happened to her.
the work visa situation

1329
01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:25.583
was such that she was
breaking immigration laws.

1330
01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:28.210
And so she had to come back
and I said.

1331
01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:31.505
"Well. if you do.
don't go back to California."

1332
01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:33.674
She said. "Well. mom.
what else am I going to do?

1333
01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.718
It's not like
I can get a job at McDonald's."

1334
01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:37.428
I said. "Sure you can.

1335
01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:40.514
You can get a job at McDonald's.
you know. flipping burgers

1336
01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:42.349
until you can find
something else."

1337
01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.768
Just get me out of here. man.

1338
01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:47.688
{\an8}All she wanted was to be
re-embraced by the only family

1339
01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:50.065
{\an8}that made sense to her.
which was the WWE

1340
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:53.277
{\an8}that's all she wanted.
- Look at that.

1341
01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.987
You're talking about.
the greatest woman wrestler

1342
01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.948
of all time. this woman who
stretched the language

1343
01:06:57.972 --> 01:07:00.492
of what you can do
in sports entertainment.

1344
01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:03.037
Announcer:
takes on Jeff Jarrett...

1345
01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:06.457
Mankind: I talked to her about
the WWE Hall of Fame.

1346
01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:09.501
{\an8}You know. not to put
so much weight on it.

1347
01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:16.091
{\an8}♪♪

1348
01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:18.761
{\an8}We knew there was
a bad relationship.

1349
01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:22.223
{\an8}but nobody said
we can't go there.

1350
01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:25.726
We're going to ask for Hunter.
we're going to ask for Vince.

1351
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:29.146
we're going to ask for business
and legal and economy.

1352
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.398
And hope that we don't
get escorted out.

1353
01:07:31.422 --> 01:07:33.442
You know. we're going to get her
into the Hall of Fame.

1354
01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:37.720
{\an8}Anzaldo:
We're on a campaign to get her
into the Hall of Fame this year.

1355
01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:52.127
{\an3}Well. we were not
greeted favorably.

1356
01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:55.005
So I guess nobody's available
at the WWE

1357
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:59.301
to speak with us at the moment.
but we're going to keep trying.

1358
01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:02.513
You know. we'll make it happen.
We'll figure it out.

1359
01:08:02.537 --> 01:08:04.014
Chyna:
When Anthony was at the desk

1360
01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:05.849
and I was standing there
next to him.

1361
01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:08.477
I could see people
getting on the elevator

1362
01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.938
and everybody was staring
right at me.

1363
01:08:10.962 --> 01:08:15.734
I got a couple smiles.
but that type of thing.

1364
01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:22.199
{\an8}♪♪

1365
01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:28.664
{\an8}♪♪

1366
01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:31.125
Potylo: By the time we got
to California.

1367
01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:32.710
she was really happy

1368
01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:36.588
and I lived with Chyna
for three months there.

1369
01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.340
Oh!

1370
01:08:38.364 --> 01:08:39.842
Well. hello.

1371
01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.469
To wake up in the morning with
Chyna to be like.

1372
01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:45.264
"Wake up Rob. we're going to
have apple smoothies."

1373
01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:49.143
I mean. she was so fun. She had
a fabulous sense of humor.

1374
01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.561
[ Laughs ]

1375
01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:53.647
And like. we had so much
freakin' fun.

1376
01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:55.274
And that way we leave
on a high note.

1377
01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:57.359
We shot funny videos together.

1378
01:08:57.383 --> 01:09:00.529
We did yoga on the beach.

1379
01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.614
Turn to the camera and just say

1380
01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:06.744
random things slowly and
dramatically now.

1381
01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:08.829
I mean. we were two outsiders.

1382
01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:10.622
And breathe.

1383
01:09:10.646 --> 01:09:13.959
And we found much peace
and happiness

1384
01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:18.005
just being around each other
for those three months.

1385
01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:19.840
My name is Robbie.

1386
01:09:19.864 --> 01:09:21.300
This is Chyna.

1387
01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:26.871
Another episode of WWY. WW Yoga.

1388
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.601
We just had our own world.

1389
01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:33.604
and I never wanted
to let that summer go.

1390
01:09:33.628 --> 01:09:35.064
It was amazing.

1391
01:09:35.088 --> 01:09:38.275
One day we will
be walking in fields of gold.

1392
01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:44.573
{\an1}There will be no more rude
awakening. no more illusion.

1393
01:09:44.597 --> 01:09:47.409
Tap out.
Tap if you hear me.

1394
01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:49.953
Mankind: I'm so happy to hear
that she felt healthy

1395
01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:54.041
and she was beautiful place.
you know. overlook the ocean.

1396
01:09:54.065 --> 01:09:57.336
It was like. "Wow.
she's in a place where she can.

1397
01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.171
you know. feel good."

1398
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.030
And I have the best unit
because it's a corner

1399
01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:08.263
And all the windows are.
like. out.

1400
01:10:08.287 --> 01:10:10.724
Plug my lights in.

1401
01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:13.977
Potylo:
I tried to be the voice on the
other end that would be like.

1402
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:15.604
"Hey. you
okay. what's going on?"

1403
01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:19.108
And and then I moved
to Hollywood and then that's

1404
01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:22.009
when things really started
coming off the rails.

1405
01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:29.451
{\an8}Angra: So I'm just going to
knock on the door in a second.

1406
01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:30.953
{\an8}[ Knocks ]

1407
01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:36.458
Alright. go for it
and then. you know. Yeah.

1408
01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:41.338
Hey. what's up.
come on into my crib.

1409
01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.382
Anzaldo: At night.
she was out of control...

1410
01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:47.928
{\an8}cheap wine and her Valium
and whatever other

1411
01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:53.475
{\an8}funky pill she had from the day
back in Japan

1412
01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.335
or whatever that
I was unaware of.

1413
01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:00.232
{\an8}So beautiful.

1414
01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:04.403
{\an8}I'm the luckiest woman in the
world just for today.

1415
01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:07.698
{\an8}She sent me an e-mail when she
was in Cincinnati at a Comic-Con

1416
01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:12.327
{\an8}and she was sick
and Anthony was pushing her.

1417
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:15.164
I sort of started
to get the feeling

1418
01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:19.001
that he was kind of controlling
things at that point.

1419
01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:23.672
I know this is. you know. I
signed up for this for the doc.

1420
01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:28.886
And the only reason I'm
sharing these small bits here

1421
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.472
and there is because.

1422
01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:34.266
you know. it all looks
like unicorns and rainbows.

1423
01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:35.934
And for the most part.
every day...

1424
01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.353
I gonna get [Indistinct speech]
for really. really.

1425
01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:40.397
But I did want to show you that.
you know.

1426
01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:44.902
that I am putting in the work
and and what is happening here.

1427
01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:46.904
Well. it seems that I think
it's going to be

1428
01:11:46.928 --> 01:11:48.447
an amazing story and...

1429
01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:54.203
{\an8}♪♪

1430
01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:57.039
Potylo:
He cared about the movie.
he cared about how he was going

1431
01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:58.832
to look like the provider
in the movie.

1432
01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:02.544
{\an8}just didn't quite plan on how he
was actually going to fix her.

1433
01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:06.924
And I don't think
he really cared too much.

1434
01:12:06.948 --> 01:12:10.052
Dr. Pinsky: People have this
grave lack of understanding

1435
01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:14.056
about trying to heal the past.
It's a low priority.

1436
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.974
{\an8}The here and now is what counts.

1437
01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:18.352
{\an8}And we have a deadly illness
we got to treat that

1438
01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:21.188
{\an8}and then we have to build the
capacity to regulate emotions.

1439
01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:24.733
{\an8}And then maybe there's
some opportunity to. you know.

1440
01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:28.570
continue inside to continue
looking at what the things were

1441
01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:30.405
that set you up if they want.

1442
01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:33.909
{\an1}It doesn't really do anything to
magically confront your abusers

1443
01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:37.770
nothing except maybe stir you up
more and make you want to use.

1444
01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:44.545
{\an1}We are going black market
on some Ambien. right?

1445
01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:46.713
Some Ambien 10?
- Ambien and the Diazepam.

1446
01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:48.882
We're probably... Oh. and we did
the Diazepam. too?

1447
01:12:48.906 --> 01:12:52.135
- No. we have to do the Diazepam.
- I was going to say so.

1448
01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:54.555
{\an1}Should we do that today?
Let's do that now. Okay.

1449
01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:57.182
{\an1}And I think we'll keep that
from Dr. Drew for the moment.

1450
01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.184
There's a part of me that
doesn't want to

1451
01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.144
give him information
he would rather not know

1452
01:13:01.168 --> 01:13:02.521
because it incriminates him.

1453
01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:04.690
But we're not doing
anything illegal.

1454
01:13:04.714 --> 01:13:06.024
This is a legal practice

1455
01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.818
{\an1}to order medicine
from another country.

1456
01:13:07.842 --> 01:13:10.028
How are you. Dr. Drew?

1457
01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:12.573
{\an8}Dr. Pinsky:
I'm good. I'm mortified that
you're having such trouble.

1458
01:13:12.597 --> 01:13:16.243
I have. like. 10 Halcion left.

1459
01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:19.538
This is a totally crazy
combination of medicine.

1460
01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:22.207
- Yeah.
- That dangerous and crazy.

1461
01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:25.836
- Okay.
- That's why I need you to go

1462
01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.129
see somebody
as soon as possible.

1463
01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:29.590
Yes.

1464
01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:32.676
{\an1}And then isn't there some
OxyContin in there. too?

1465
01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.012
- Say it again?
- Yes.

1466
01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:37.014
{\an3}But I haven't been taking that.

1467
01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.432
- Okay.
- What's that?

1468
01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:40.434
OxyContin.

1469
01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:45.480
I don't know that that would be
definitely a death tonic.

1470
01:13:45.504 --> 01:13:48.025
That would be potentially
a death mixture.

1471
01:13:48.049 --> 01:13:50.110
If you added opiates to what
you're doing.

1472
01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:51.737
you would not breathe.

1473
01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:54.406
So that's really bad news.

1474
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:57.534
Opiate addiction is fatal.
It's deadly. deadly. deadly.

1475
01:13:57.558 --> 01:14:00.203
And my recollection is she was
on the benzo opiate combo

1476
01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:02.205
that was killing so many people.

1477
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:04.374
And you've got to get
you've got to get seen.

1478
01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:06.376
You've got to get taken care of
when you're on that.

1479
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.921
{\an1}Well. in the meantime. though.
while this stuff is dangerous.

1480
01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:13.300
obviously. and we certainly
understand that.

1481
01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:17.512
it is keeping her. you know.

the Sunday.

1642
01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:33.466
{\an8}so I called Anthony to
see what's going on.

1643
01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:37.804
{\an8}I couldn't get hold of her.

1644
01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:40.682
Anzaldo:
She's not responding to anybody.

1645
01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:44.585
My hope was that she had
just lost her cell phone.

1646
01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:48.857
Potylo: And so he went over
there and coincidentally.

1647
01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:52.026
he had another person
with him to film

1648
01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.737
and apparently
he was going up there

1649
01:22:54.761 --> 01:22:58.283
to talk to her
about intervention

1650
01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:02.912
or talk some sense into her.

1651
01:23:02.936 --> 01:23:04.414
Chyna?

1652
01:23:04.438 --> 01:23:07.792
{\an8}♪♪

1653
01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.420
I kind of knew.

1654
01:23:10.444 --> 01:23:16.217
Turned the corner.
looked in her bedroom.

1655
01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:21.121
and there she was.
Lying in her bed.

1656
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:28.396
As peaceful. As she could be.

1657
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:33.443
And around six o'clock.
Erik calls and he's just like.

1658
01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:36.863
"Yeah. Chyna's gone. dude."

1659
01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:38.865
I'm like.
"What do you mean she's gone?"

1660
01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:41.868
And he's like.
Anthony found her this morning.

1661
01:23:41.892 --> 01:23:44.245
He didn't want me
to even call you.

1662
01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:47.123
And I've seen the footage
and he brags about it

1663
01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:49.792
a lot afterwards.
how he had that footage.

1664
01:23:49.816 --> 01:23:53.421
Anybody in their right mind
to think that was worth anything

1665
01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:56.299
but destroying immediately
afterwards.

1666
01:23:56.323 --> 01:23:57.842
you know. they got problems.

1667
01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:00.720
It's a shocker for millions
of wrestling fans.

1668
01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:03.789
WWE legend Chyna has died.

1669
01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:09.312
{\an8}It's the same feeling
and thought I have every time

1670
01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:12.899
{\an8}doctor prescribed medication
was killing my patients.

1671
01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:18.404

1674
01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:35.546
{\an8}Hamilton:
I don't want to say that she
intentionally took her own life.

1675
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:38.007
{\an8}I think it was accidental.

1676
01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:41.928
{\an8}But I think she was just tired
of putting up a good fight

1677
01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:45.890
and trying to find her way.

1678
01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.374
Just wanted some peace.

1679
01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:52.689
{\an8}It crushed me. when I.
when I heard she passed.

1680
01:24:52.713 --> 01:24:57.986
I was so mad. so mad.
but I don't know why.

1681
01:24:58.010 --> 01:24:59.279
Like I do know why.

1682
01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:01.030
because she's a very good friend
of mine.

1683
01:25:01.054 --> 01:25:03.032
And I would guess it was because
she couldn't confide in me

1684
01:25:03.056 --> 01:25:06.869
or tell me what was going
why she's hurting so much.

1685
01:25:06.893 --> 01:25:08.413
You know. I'm pissed.

1686
01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:11.606
No. why didn't somebody
do something earlier?

1687
01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:18.131
Anzaldo:
My my job when Chyna came back
was to help her spiritually

1688
01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:19.924
mind. body. and soul.

1689
01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:23.094
I was her business manager. her
manager. her friend.

1690
01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:24.512
I did it all.

1691
01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:28.224
Her very last text.

1692
01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:33.229
was about me and her mother
and how much she hated us.

1693
01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:37.400
{\an8}I gave him permission
to have her cremated

1694
01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:38.985
and I said take
three quarters of them.

1695
01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:40.987
scatter them
in the Pacific Ocean

1696
01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:44.657
and send a quarter to me.

1697
01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:47.994
But he didn't scatter them all.
he only scared half of them.

1698
01:25:48.018 --> 01:25:56.018
He kept a quarter of the ashes.
which has just infuriated me.

1699
01:25:56.735 --> 01:26:00.006
Anthony put on
this memorial service.

1700
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:03.825
And so I said.
"I'm not going."

1701
01:26:05.702 --> 01:26:08.681
Potylo: He had this
worst... memorial on Earth.

1702
01:26:08.705 --> 01:26:13.770
He put her ashes
into this bedazzled urn.

1703
01:26:13.794 --> 01:26:15.313
The bitch is in the house.

1704

[ Cheers and applause ]

1705
01:26:16.588 --> 01:26:18.066
Potylo: In my heart of hearts.

1706
01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:20.860
I thought that not only
would Chyna find a light

1707
01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:23.279
at the end of the tunnel.
but Erik would.

1708

Angra:
It's really hard to watch.

1709
01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:27.617
but only because
I was like there.

1710
01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:29.911
I think I didn't really want
this to be my film. right?

1711
01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:31.454
You're the guy
who all let Chyna die. right?

1712
01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:32.747
That's what I would say.
I'd be like.

1713
01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:34.123
"Remember the person is dead."

1714

the addict who let Chyna die.

who's also an addict."
Yep. that's what happened.

1717
01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.839
But I didn't let her die.

I think she was a warrior.

I think she just had some
titanic demons she was battling.

she was a victim.
