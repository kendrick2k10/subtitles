why you two stopped hanging out.

You were joined at the hip.
Maybe y'all should reconnect.

a time that should be about
self-discovery.

62

and unique about themselves.

63
00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:13.667
they instead
choose to homogenize in groups

64
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.375

they so deeply crave.

my boobs done at the same time.

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:57.708
…a junior study buddy
to show him the ropes.

167
00:08:57.792 --> 00:08:58.792
[Darby titters]

168
00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:01.208
[whispering] He just transferred in
from a Montessori school.

169
00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:02.792
so all this is pretty foreign to him.

170
00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:06.667
Oh. okay. Yeah. I don't know
if I'm the best person to do that.

171
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.958
Sure. you are. You're an honors student.
and you both seem like such--

172
00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.667
-He's thinking. "Weirdos."
-Abstract thinkers.

173
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.750
-Mmm. [chuckles]
-Yeah.

174
00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:18.083
Extracurricular activities meet-and-greet
starts in ten minutes.

175
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:22.625
Walk Alex through it.
Help him acclimatize. [clicks tongue]

176
00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:26.500
-That guy. Uh. we're-- Yep.
-Yep. Okay.

177
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.750
So. do you have any burning questions
about Frederick Douglass High

178
00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:36.000
I can answer in the next two minutes?

179
00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:37.958
Uh. that for starters.

180
00:09:38.583 --> 00:09:41.875
Yeah. the superintendent passed a bill
allowing corporate sponsorship

181
00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:45.625
of cafeterias so that schools could save
on the cost of lunches. [chuckles]

182
00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:47.000
Jeez.

183
00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:49.167
My old school
didn't have this type of structure.

184
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.833
You know.
the bell telling you when and where to go.

185
00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:54.333
having to raise your hand
to get permission to take a leak.

186
00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:57.167
Public school is only
a few rules away from the Marines.

187
00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.417
[laughing] Yeah. That's funny.

188
00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:03.292
So. why did you leave Montessori?

189
00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:08.167
I had a bit of a rough patch last year.
You know. some issues. so--

190
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.458
I feel your pain. junior class buddy.

191
00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:12.167
So. who do you hang with?

192
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.625
Uh. I don't.

193
00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:15.458
Oh. The lone wolf.

194
00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:16.542
[chuckles]

195
00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:19.042
You said something earlier
about your work?

196
00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:21.958
Oh. no. N-- It was nothing. [laughs]

197
00:10:22.042 --> 00:10:23.417
I thought you were someone else.

198
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.333
Um. I do some social work
on Friday nights.

199
00:10:26.417 --> 00:10:27.583
Social work?

200
00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:30.917
When in doubt. the truth gets people
to bug off every time.

201
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.375
Yeah. Yeah. it's for dead people.
I help them pass on to the next realm.

202
00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:36.083
Uh-- [laughs]

203
00:10:36.167 --> 00:10:40.208
That's really cool.
I'm actually into psychic mediums too.

204
00:10:41.042 --> 00:10:43.000
-Oh. yeah?
-Yeah. What are the odds?

205
00:10:43.083 --> 00:10:44.083
That backfired.

206
00:10:44.667 --> 00:10:47.292
[Alex] So. uh.
are you in any of these clubs?

207
00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:49.375
Maybe in another lifetime.

208
00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:51.333
At my old school.
I had a Stephen King book club.

209
00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:52.458
Oh. uh-huh.

210
00:10:52.542 --> 00:10:54.542
But you know.
if I'm forced to be here. which I am.

211
00:10:54.625 --> 00:10:59.208
I've decided I want the most public school
experience ever known to man.

212
00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:02.000
[laughs] Wow.
You're quite the glass half-full guy.

213
00:11:02.833 --> 00:11:06.208
I mean. if you don't embrace
the absurdities in life. right?

214
00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:07.292
It's unlivable.

215
00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:09.250
Mmm.

216
00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:11.375
Ooh. prom. I've seen that in the movies.

217
00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:13.000
[laughs]

218
00:11:13.917 --> 00:11:15.417
Uh. I gotta run.

219
00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:17.917
Oh. Okay. uh--

220
00:11:18.708 --> 00:11:21.875
I-I'd love to talk to you more
about the paranormal stuff.

221
00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:24.292
[sighs] Lone wolf. Alex.

222
00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:27.542
-"Lone" being the key adjective there.
-Right. [chuckles]

223
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.333
Yeah. See you.

224
00:11:30.417 --> 00:11:31.458
[howls]

225
00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:32.958
Yeah.

226
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.375
Mmm. That's not good.

227
00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:37.208
All right. Listen up. people.

228
00:11:37.292 --> 00:11:41.292
We got a few cheerleaders here who want
to do a special presentation just for you.

229
00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:43.208
And action!

230
00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:44.625
Let's go. [claps]

231
00:11:44.708 --> 00:11:47.125
Hi. Cougars!
I'm Capri Donahue. and this is--

232
00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:48.208
Taylor.

233
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.125
Taylor. Bree. Piper and Todd.

234
00:11:52.208 --> 00:11:55.875
And we're here to tell all the gym classes
about cheer tryouts next week.

235
00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.417
Here's a little skit we prepared.
Hope you enjoy!

236
00:11:58.917 --> 00:12:00.292
Hi! Are you new here?

237
00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:02.042
Yes. I'm a freshman.

238
00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:04.458
-[gasps]
-[Taylor] And I've always dreamed of being

239
00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:06.750
a cheerleader.
but I'm so intimidated by it.

240
00:12:06.833 --> 00:12:08.625
Isn't it just for shallow. hot girls?

241
00:12:08.708 --> 00:12:11.917
I'm so glad you asked.
And the answer is. that's offensive.

242
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.958
Cheerleaders aren't just pretty people
who are happy all the time.

243
00:12:15.042 --> 00:12:17.625
We face the same challenges.
Just like you.

244
00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:19.917
Really? Even you. the head cheerleader?

245
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.750
-[Capri] Yes. even me.
-Yeah.

246
00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:24.083
But cheer allows us
to be the change that we wanna see.

247
00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:27.000
[Bree] We support female empowerment.
just like Beyoncé.

248
00:12:27.083 --> 00:12:28.333
When one of us falls-- [gasps]

249
00:12:28.417 --> 00:12:30.833
-The sisterhood is there to catch us.
-Jesus.

250
00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.708
Next week. I'll be there.

251
00:12:32.792 --> 00:12:34.125
[whispering] Piper. at the end.

252
00:12:34.208 --> 00:12:36.208
But cheer keeps the world moving.

253
00:12:36.292 --> 00:12:37.917
Because when something gets us down--

254
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.250
-[Piper] Cheer--
-Lifts us back up. [giggling]

255
00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:42.708
[dance music playing]

256
00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:45.542
[crowd cheering. applauding]

257
00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:47.292
Let's hear it. Cougars!

258
00:12:47.375 --> 00:12:50.292
[cheerleaders] Tryouts next week.
show us what you can do.

259
00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:52.292
[Bree] Tryouts next week!

260
00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:53.833
-[Taylor] Now. Piper!
-"Now." what?

261
00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:55.250
Next week? I'll be there.

262
00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:57.167
-Shit.
-[Bree and Capri] Whoo!

263
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.167
-[Bree] Let's go. Cougars!
-[Taylor] Whoo!

264
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.167
My dad said I can only invite 50 people.
but I was. like.

265
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.750
"Come on.
the DJ tent holds at least a hundo."

266
00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:09.917
Ugh! Can we get a corporate sponsor from…

267
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
[electricity crackles]

268
00:13:11.083 --> 00:13:14.417
…the electric company or something?
This is ridiculous.

269
00:13:18.042 --> 00:13:19.167
Give me my clothes.

270
00:13:19.917 --> 00:13:22.958
Why would I take your clothes?
Not planning on attending a funeral.

271
00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:24.458
[laughing]

272
00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:27.625
I have no problem walking up
to Principal Morgan's office in my towel

273
00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:30.000
to discuss his zero tolerance
bullying policy.

274
00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:32.542
Oh. my God!
You're totally gaslighting me right now.

275
00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:35.958
You're the one who bullied me
in front of the entire class this morning.

276
00:13:36.042 --> 00:13:37.583
You called me an ass.

277
00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:40.917
Technically.
I called your actual ass an ass.

278
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.958
Maybe you'll understand that more when
we get to the anatomy section of bio lab.

279
00:13:45.042 --> 00:13:46.625
[laughs. clears throat]

280
00:13:46.708 --> 00:13:47.708
[laughs]

281
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.625
It was just a joke. No need to go crying
to the principal. freak show.

282
00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:57.333
-[screams. gasps]
-[water splashes]

283
00:13:57.417 --> 00:13:59.167
Ow! My ass.

284
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.417
-Capri!
-Are you okay?

285
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.917
I'm fine. Just-- [sighs] I slipped.

286
00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:04.792
[electricity crackling]

287
00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:06.792
[whimpers]

288
00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:08.167
[crackling fades]

289
00:14:09.292 --> 00:14:10.375
[police radio chatter]

290
00:14:10.458 --> 00:14:14.583
[officer] Miss Harper. thank you
so much for giving us your statement.

291
00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:17.583
We'll be in touch
if we have any follow-up questions.

292
00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:20.000
Miss Harper?

293
00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:22.625
Uh-- Yeah. yes. [chuckles] Okay.

294
00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:23.708
Okay.

295
00:14:25.542 --> 00:14:26.542
All right. ladies.

296
00:14:26.625 --> 00:14:29.333
[sniffs] Go home. get some rest.

297
00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:33.417
Remember.
we have grief counselors available.

298
00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:37.625
Seeing a dead person
is a very traumatic experience

299
00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:40.750
which none of us are equipped for.

300
00:14:40.833 --> 00:14:42.542
[laughs]

301
00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:43.917
[Darby coughing]

302
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.625
[whispers] Sorry.

303
00:14:45.708 --> 00:14:48.250
Something in the throat. [clears throat]

304
00:14:50.958 --> 00:14:53.208
-[birds chirping]
-[dog barking in distance]

305
00:14:57.792 --> 00:14:59.042
Hey.

306
00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:01.125
[Darby] Hey. [chuckles]

307
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:04.250
[groans. sighs]

308
00:15:06.125 --> 00:15:08.542
Yeah. She was a beauty.

309
00:15:13.667 --> 00:15:16.083
I know you don't like
talking about your mom.

310
00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:20.542
And I'm not trying to push you.

311
00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:26.125
I know Capri's death
is probably a trigger. Right?

312
00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:29.458
No. No. really. I'm-- I'm fine.

313
00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:32.042
Honey.

314
00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:33.125
I'm just tired.

315
00:15:36.667 --> 00:15:38.458
So-- But thank you.

316
00:15:41.875 --> 00:15:42.875
Night.

317
00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:47.750
-[Dad] I love you.
-Love you.

318
00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:53.583
[sighs]

319
00:16:09.917 --> 00:16:11.958
Wake up. bitch. Wake up!

320
00:16:13.417 --> 00:16:14.417
Oh. goddamn it.

321
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.875
[gasps]

322
00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.583
-[light switch clicks]
-So it's true. You can see me.

323
00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:20.792
[Darby] How did you even-- Uh--

324
00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:22.750
Remember groundskeeper Gary?

325
00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:24.375
-Uh--
-Yeah.

326
00:16:24.458 --> 00:16:27.000
He told me all about
your little "ability."

327
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.583
-[sighs]
-Bring me back.

328
00:16:28.667 --> 00:16:29.667
Darby!

329
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.250
Bring me back. Now!

330
00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:37.375
Capri. I can't bring you back.
I can only help you move on.

331
00:16:38.292 --> 00:16:39.292
Move on?

332
00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:43.125
No. Cheer tryouts are next week.

333
00:16:43.208 --> 00:16:44.958
My Sweet Seventeen
is coming up in a month.

334
00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:47.958
I've planned it the whole year.
It costs more than my sister's wedding.

335
00:16:48.042 --> 00:16:50.542
[inhales sharply]
Denial. It's the hardest stage.

336
00:16:50.625 --> 00:16:53.708
Listen. I'm-- [sighs]
…I'm really sorry you died.

337
00:16:53.792 --> 00:16:57.042
I truly am. But you are dead.

338
00:16:57.125 --> 00:16:59.833
and neither I.
nor anyone else can bring you back.

339
00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:04.375
[electricity crackling. whooshing]

340
00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:05.833
[screams]

341
00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:06.958
[Capri gasps]

342
00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:09.792
Holy crap!

343
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.833
-Did I do that?
-[sighs]

344
00:17:11.917 --> 00:17:14.792
-Am I coming back to life?
-No. dude. you're a form of energy.

345
00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:17.250
So. with intense focus and practice.

346
00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:19.583
or I guess just pure.
unfiltered teenage rage.

347
00:17:19.667 --> 00:17:22.000
Deados can manipulate things
in the real world.

348
00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.625
-"Deados?"
-Yeah. Yeah. that's what I call your kind.

349
00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:27.583
The in-betweeners like you.

350
00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:31.208
Okay. but-but-but what about. um. Gary?

351
00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:34.167
-I mean. he died our freshman year. right?
-Yeah.

352
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.208
He's a Stayer.
It means he chooses to be here.

353
00:17:37.292 --> 00:17:40.292
He's waiting for his wife to die
so they can pass on together.

354
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:46.292
Okay. cute. Um.
Then. I will be a Stayer too.

355
00:17:47.208 --> 00:17:51.125
Yeah. I don't wanna go to some…
[scoffs] …creepy afterlife. No. thank you.

356
00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:53.417
No. no. Capri.
this is not where you're meant to be.

357
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.083
so it'll be very difficult
for you to be at peace here.

358
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.792
Especially you. feeling like
you're missing out on all that stupid shit

359
00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:01.667
-you think is so important.
-[gasps]

360
00:18:02.292 --> 00:18:04.667
Oh. it might be stupid shit to you.
freak show.

361
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.792
but this is the best year of my life.

362
00:18:06.875 --> 00:18:08.708
Everyone thinks senior year is peak.
but no.

363
00:18:08.792 --> 00:18:11.000
Seniors have one foot out the door
to college.

364
00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:15.542
I am at the epicenter
of the ultimate high school experience.

365
00:18:15.625 --> 00:18:17.375
[sighing] I'm not going anywhere.

366
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:22.708
You literally will never be able
to see yourself again.

367
00:18:22.792 --> 00:18:24.542
You're dead.

368
00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:28.208
So is all that shit you care about.

369
00:18:28.292 --> 00:18:31.500
Cheer championships.
homecoming. your birthday.

370
00:18:31.583 --> 00:18:33.125
You can't experience it anymore.

371
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:34.750
[sighs]

372
00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:37.125
[exhales deeply]

373
00:18:37.208 --> 00:18:38.208
I'm sorry.

374
00:18:41.458 --> 00:18:44.375
Look. I can deliver whatever message
you want to whomever.

375
00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:50.292
But once you make the decision
to move on. you move on.

376
00:18:53.458 --> 00:18:54.708
[Darby sighs]

377
00:18:54.792 --> 00:18:57.792
Look. you can stay here tonight
if you're freaked out.

378
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.667
But I'm going to sleep because.
well. I'm alive.

379
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.875
and I have another day
of living hell tomorrow.

380
00:19:04.792 --> 00:19:06.750
I'm sorry you died.

381
00:19:06.833 --> 00:19:07.833
[light switch clicks]

382
00:19:09.208 --> 00:19:13.167
<i>I'm Katlyn Kelley. reporting live
from Frederick Douglass High School.</i>

383
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.417
<i>where yesterday. students witnessed
the shocking and tragic death</i>

384
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.875
<i>of their popular classmate.
head cheerleader.</i>

385
00:19:18.958 --> 00:19:20.208
Capricorn Donahue.

386
00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:23.250
[sighs] I'm on TV.
and I can't even enjoy it.

387
00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:26.250
Grieving students
have been visiting this memorial

388
00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:28.167
for the beloved cheerleader.

389
00:19:29.083 --> 00:19:32.250
Could you tell us a little about
what made Capri so special?

390
00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:36.292
[sighs] She was an amazing person
and such a great friend.

391
00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:38.208
And I'm just gonna miss her so much.

392
00:19:38.292 --> 00:19:40.458
I've literally
never seen you before in my life.

393
00:19:40.542 --> 00:19:44.042
Capri was planning a big
Sweet Seventeen birthday for next month.

394
00:19:44.125 --> 00:19:45.792
Can you tell us more about that?

395
00:19:45.875 --> 00:19:48.667
[sobbing. sniffling] Yeah.
she was so excited about the party.

396
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.792
She put everything she had
into planning it.

397
00:19:51.875 --> 00:19:54.292
Oh. guys! I'm still here-- [screams]

398
00:19:54.375 --> 00:19:57.750
Is there anything else you would like
our viewers to know about Capri?

399
00:19:57.833 --> 00:20:03.083
Just that she was the glue
that bonded together our sisterhood.

400
00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:06.708
She was actually a Scorpio.

401
00:20:07.375 --> 00:20:11.417
<i>Also. follow us on Instagram. Thank you.</i>

402
00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.875
<i>A young spark of life. gone in a flash.
A cheer heard no more.</i>

403
00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:20.042
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Maybe you should stay at home.

404
00:20:20.125 --> 00:20:21.583
[Katlyn] <i>Signing off.</i>

405
00:20:21.667 --> 00:20:23.583
Nah. it's just putting off the inevitable.

406
00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:26.792
[Capri] That's the photo
you brought to my shrine?

407
00:20:26.875 --> 00:20:30.708
Taylor. you look adorable.
and my eyes are literally closed!

408
00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:31.833
[screams]

409
00:20:34.458 --> 00:20:36.417
-[gasps]
-[Bree] Did you guys see that?

410
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.542
[sighs]

411
00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:46.917
[Cougars laughing]

412
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.833
[Taylor] That practice killed me.
Capri would have been so proud.

413
00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:52.875
[Bree] Nationals. here we come! [cheers]

414
00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:55.292
[giggles] So. where are we going tonight?

415
00:20:55.375 --> 00:20:56.750
[chatters indistinctly]

416
00:20:58.708 --> 00:21:01.083
I just can't believe that she's gone.

417
00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:04.000
I had my nose modeled after hers.

418
00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:07.458
I heard she shot 50 feet in the air.
and her pants flew off.

419
00:21:07.542 --> 00:21:10.125
Do you think James Harris
will rejoin jazz band now?

420
00:21:10.208 --> 00:21:13.417
[student 5] "Dead Cheerleader"
is a killer name for a band.

421
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.208
[student 6] Alive Capricorn Donahue
was an "it girl." but dead Capri Donahue?

422
00:21:17.292 --> 00:21:19.167
Oh. she's a legend. honey.

423
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.250
[Gary] Hey. here she is--
Hey. Darby. My buddy. Mel.

424
00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:24.792
-Hi.
-He passed last night.

425
00:21:24.875 --> 00:21:26.333
-Uh. heart attack.
-Yeah.

426
00:21:26.417 --> 00:21:28.292
-Oh. Sorry.
-You know. So if you don't mind.

427
00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:30.500
he's gonna sit and watch
our lunchtime chess games

428
00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:32.875
-until you can help him move on.
-Yeah. sure.

429
00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:35.667
My wife. Deb. uh. she passed 17 years ago.

430
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.292
and you know. that's a long time.

431
00:21:37.375 --> 00:21:39.333
I was in a lot better shape then. right?

432
00:21:39.417 --> 00:21:41.167
Uh. what if she's not

433
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.958
-attracted to me anymore?
-Maybe.

434
00:21:43.042 --> 00:21:45.750
Well. I like to think
that when you pass on.

435
00:21:45.833 --> 00:21:47.542
you pass as your optimal self.

436
00:21:47.625 --> 00:21:50.667
And I'm pretty sure that has nothing
to do with your superficial exterior.

437
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.625
Oh. my optimal self?

438
00:21:52.708 --> 00:21:54.750
-Yeah.
-I like that.

439
00:21:54.833 --> 00:21:56.958
-[Gary laughs]
-[laughs] Okay.

440
00:21:57.042 --> 00:21:59.417
-Well. we'll talk soon.
-Way to be. Darby. Thank you.

441
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.667
-She is good!
-I told you. huh?

442
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.042
[Darby] Oh. no.

443
00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:11.083
Oh. thank God.

444
00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:17.458
-Hola! Oh!
-Oh! Jeez-- [scoffs]

445
00:22:17.542 --> 00:22:20.208
-God. you scared the shit out of me.
-[laughing] Oh. Sorry.

446
00:22:20.292 --> 00:22:21.292
Are you okay?

447
00:22:21.375 --> 00:22:23.083
Yeah. fine. I--

448
00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:26.500
It's just someone I'm trying to avoid.
[chuckles]

449
00:22:26.583 --> 00:22:29.000
Oh. Got a little stalker? [laughs]

450
00:22:29.083 --> 00:22:30.542
[inhales sharply] Potentially.

451
00:22:30.625 --> 00:22:32.042
Oh. you're serious.

452
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.625
-Oh. my bad. Okay. Uh…
-[chuckles]

453
00:22:35.375 --> 00:22:37.083
You wanna talk about it?

454
00:22:38.333 --> 00:22:42.250
Well. the frustrating thing is.
is I don't think anyone would understand.

455
00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:43.583
Mmm. I get that.

456
00:22:44.417 --> 00:22:48.042
Don't have to explain anything to me.
I'm just making sure you're okay.

457
00:22:48.917 --> 00:22:50.042
Thanks.

458
00:22:51.833 --> 00:22:53.208
-Um--
-So. what's up?

459
00:22:53.292 --> 00:22:55.750
So. you were there
with the cheerleader yesterday?

460
00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:57.667
That's pretty intense.

461
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.625
[sighs] Yeah. [screams]

462
00:22:59.708 --> 00:23:02.792
Whoo! Sorry. Alex. Too much caffeine.

463
00:23:02.875 --> 00:23:06.542
Uh. sorry. Uh. I-- I gotta go but I'll s--
Thanks for the--

464
00:23:06.625 --> 00:23:07.625
Just thanks.

465
00:23:08.208 --> 00:23:09.833
-I need to talk to you.
-[Alex] Okay.

466
00:23:09.917 --> 00:23:11.833
I don't work at school. Capri.

467
00:23:11.917 --> 00:23:15.167
What do you mean. "Work"?
I'm not asking you to do my taxes.

468
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.625
-[sighs]
-[bell rings]

469
00:23:18.292 --> 00:23:19.292
[sighs]

470
00:23:19.833 --> 00:23:21.000
[door closes]

471
00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:22.250
Okay. what do you want?

472
00:23:22.917 --> 00:23:25.500
I have decided that I do.
in fact. want to move on.

473
00:23:25.583 --> 00:23:28.042
It's incredibly boring being here
and being invisible.

474
00:23:28.125 --> 00:23:30.125
Also. apparently.
I'm stuck in this outfit.

475
00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:32.667
If I knew I was gonna die.
I would've worn way more accessories.

476
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.833
Smart decision. Come see me Friday night.

477
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.208
Whoa! I haven't told you
when I wanna move on.

478
00:23:38.292 --> 00:23:40.000
Okay. I don't have time for this.

479
00:23:40.083 --> 00:23:42.750
It'll be next month.
After my Sweet Seventeen.

480
00:23:42.833 --> 00:23:45.792
No. No. just go to your funeral.
Yeah. everyone will be crying

481
00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:48.333
and talking about
how awesome you were. You'll love it.

482
00:23:48.417 --> 00:23:50.875
Ew. no. I hate funerals.
they're mad depressing.

483
00:23:50.958 --> 00:23:53.500
I want the party.
Which is where you come in.

484
00:23:53.583 --> 00:23:55.750
You're gonna make sure
the party still happens.

485
00:23:55.833 --> 00:23:57.375
[scoffs]

486
00:23:57.458 --> 00:24:01.250
I think that curling iron incident
fried your last remaining brain cell.

487
00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:02.625
I-- [gasps]

488
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.708
[exhales sharply]

489
00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:09.792
Game on.

490
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.833
Ideally. you'll do this voluntarily.

491
00:24:12.917 --> 00:24:16.208
But I've been practicing the whole
manipulation of objects thing all morning.

492
00:24:16.292 --> 00:24:19.167
So. I can make life very weird
for you if it comes down to it.

493
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.542
-Psycho.
-[scoffs]

494
00:24:20.625 --> 00:24:22.583
[Lyman] I just wanted to let you know.

495
00:24:22.667 --> 00:24:25.375
-Sorry I'm late.
-[Lyman] That's okay. Darby.

496
00:24:25.458 --> 00:24:26.458
[door closes]

497
00:24:26.542 --> 00:24:29.125
As I was saying.
James will not be in today.

498
00:24:29.208 --> 00:24:31.458
For obvious reasons.

499
00:24:31.542 --> 00:24:36.000
Bree. Taylor. Piper. my condolences.
I know you girls were very close.

500
00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:38.625
She really would've wanted us
to be here today.

501
00:24:38.708 --> 00:24:40.958
To remember her with everyone else.

502
00:24:41.042 --> 00:24:43.542
That's true. I mean.
they're no good to me crying in private.

503
00:24:43.625 --> 00:24:47.875
[Lyman] All right. Let's get started.
If you uncover the tray in front of you.

504
00:24:47.958 --> 00:24:49.667
you'll find today's project.

505

-Ugh.
-[biology student 2] Gross!

506

-Cool!
-I'm reporting this to PETA.

507
00:24:53.042 --> 00:24:54.292
I'm sorry. buddy.

508
00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:56.542
Um. Darby. I wanted to see
if you wouldn't mind

509
00:24:56.625 --> 00:24:59.250
dropping off James's lab homework
for him until he's back.

510
00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:01.625
Oh. Uh.
I don't really think that'd be approp--

511
00:25:01.708 --> 00:25:03.625
-What? Say yes!
-Yes. of course.

512
00:25:03.708 --> 00:25:04.833
[Taylor] Oh. my God.

513
00:25:04.917 --> 00:25:08.708
Capri's Sweet Seventeen promo video
has over. like. 200.000 views.

514
00:25:08.792 --> 00:25:10.750
-Really?
-Yeah. They played it on the news.

515
00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:13.500
-[party music plays]
-It's so tragic that it's canceled.

516
00:25:13.583 --> 00:25:15.292
Darby!

517
00:25:15.375 --> 00:25:16.917
Don't ignore me.

518
00:25:18.292 --> 00:25:20.208
Hey! I'm serious.

[electricity crackles. whizzes]

520
00:25:24.917 --> 00:25:27.250
-Hmm.
-[whispering] What are you doing? Stop.

521
00:25:27.333 --> 00:25:29.958
-Help me get the party back on.

-[whispering] Stop it.
-Darby. is everything okay?

524
00:25:34.542 --> 00:25:35.750
Yes. fine.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.583
Sorry. my hand slipped. [laughs]

530
00:25:45.667 --> 00:25:47.333
Haven't you done enough?

531
00:25:47.417 --> 00:25:49.333
Excuse me. I don't feel well.

532
00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:51.083
-[whispers] My God.
-What just happened?

533
00:25:51.167 --> 00:25:52.917
-Okay. class. Carry on.
-Oh. my God.

534
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
What a freak.

535
00:25:54.083 --> 00:25:55.917
-Clearly. she needs therapy.
-Hmm.

536
00:25:58.917 --> 00:26:00.625
What the hell are you doing to me?

537
00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:02.542
-Just say you'll help me.
-No.

539
00:26:05.167 --> 00:26:06.167
What are you-- No!

[shoes squeaking]

541
00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:10.958

-It's just till the party's back on.

546
00:26:23.792 --> 00:26:26.417
No way in hell! [grunting]

Stop. stop!

-A public toilet?
-[scoffs]

553
00:26:41.875 --> 00:26:45.125
I could've contracted
any number of deadly diseases.

554
00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:46.542
This is criminal bullying.

555
00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:48.833
I think it's criminally good haunting.

556
00:26:48.917 --> 00:26:50.625
Fine. You know what? Have at it.

557
00:26:50.708 --> 00:26:53.708
I'll just keep ignoring you
until I'm committed to a psych ward.

558
00:26:53.792 --> 00:26:56.750
Or you could help me
and be free in a month.

559
00:26:56.833 --> 00:27:00.000
All I want is to go to this party.
To see my friends having fun.

560
00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:02.250
and to dance next to James one last time.

561
00:27:02.333 --> 00:27:03.792
And then I'll move on.

562
00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:08.000
-I promise.
-And in what worldly dimension

563
00:27:08.083 --> 00:27:09.833
do you think I can throw your dream party?

564
00:27:09.917 --> 00:27:12.167
Me. the girl you call. "Freak show"?

565
00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:14.917
In a world where
I make you popular enough to do it.

566
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.750
[laughs]

567
00:27:17.667 --> 00:27:21.208
[Capri] <i>I'm gonna
let you in on a little secret.</i>

568
00:27:21.292 --> 00:27:22.917
<i>Being popular is an illusion.</i>

569
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.917
<i>Like a magic trick. or cryptocurrency.</i>

570
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.375
<i>You just have to believe in it.
And then they will too.</i>

571
00:27:31.542 --> 00:27:33.500
First. you'll need to get close
to Taylor and Bree.

572
00:27:33.583 --> 00:27:35.625
so you can convince them
to throw the party in my honor.

573
00:27:35.708 --> 00:27:37.333
[scoffs] Yeah. that sounds attainable.

574
00:27:37.417 --> 00:27:39.750
since they hate me
with the passion of a thousand suns.

575
00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:43.875
Excuse me. You won't be able to avoid them
once you join cheer.

576
00:27:43.958 --> 00:27:46.458
[laughing] Never.

577
00:27:46.542 --> 00:27:47.542
[sighs]

578
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:52.542
Aw. look at us little nuggets
in our cheesy matching uniforms.

579
00:27:52.625 --> 00:27:54.375
Hey. get outta there.

580
00:27:54.458 --> 00:27:56.958
I forgot we were even friends that summer.

581
00:27:57.042 --> 00:27:59.917
Then you were all weird
when we got back to school.

582
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.125
Oh. sorry. I was just going through
a little thing called my mom died.

583
00:28:08.167 --> 00:28:10.125
Your mom was so boss.

584
00:28:11.125 --> 00:28:12.125
[chuckles]

585
00:28:13.667 --> 00:28:15.667
Top of the pyramid at the '93 Nationals.

586
00:28:19.125 --> 00:28:21.125
Did she come to you too after she died?

587
00:28:21.708 --> 00:28:23.250
Get out.

588
00:28:23.333 --> 00:28:25.500
Okay! Touchy subject.

589
00:28:25.583 --> 00:28:29.375
But don't you think that she'd want you
to be like she was in that picture?

590
00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:32.000
Happy? Smiling? Do you even have teeth?

591
00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:34.500
[scoffs]
You're really blowing your pitch. Capri.

592
00:28:34.583 --> 00:28:35.958
Well. I just don't understand

593
00:28:36.042 --> 00:28:38.417
why you wouldn't wanna be.
at the very least. normal.

594
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.625
Well. I'm not normal.

595
00:28:39.708 --> 00:28:43.000
I've spent my childhood
being a travel agent for dead people.

596
00:28:43.083 --> 00:28:46.042
-Okay. and? We all have baggage. [laughs]
-[scoffs]

597
00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:50.542
Yeah. like getting zits and wondering
if anyone will ask you to prom.

598
00:28:50.625 --> 00:28:52.125
Deep.

599
00:28:52.833 --> 00:28:55.833
You're the most judgmental
and self-righteous person I've ever met.

600
00:28:55.917 --> 00:28:58.292
What? No. I'm not.

601
00:28:58.375 --> 00:29:01.333
Okay. then prove it. If you really
don't care what people think about you.

602
00:29:01.417 --> 00:29:04.542
then what does it matter if you hang out
with the popular crew for a month

603
00:29:04.625 --> 00:29:05.958
or less. even?

604
00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:08.125
[sighs]

605
00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:13.250
[inhales sharply] So. as soon as the party
is back on. do you promise to leave?

606
00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:15.958
Do I have your word
you'll leave after the party?

607
00:29:16.042 --> 00:29:19.833
Okay. yes. I promise.
Cross my heart and hope to die. Again.

609
00:29:21.875 --> 00:29:23.000
Okay. fine.

610
00:29:23.083 --> 00:29:24.083
Yes!

611
00:29:25.958 --> 00:29:29.000
The first order of business
is a full head-to-toe glow up.

612
00:29:29.792 --> 00:29:31.375
Hey.

613
00:29:31.458 --> 00:29:34.750
-What's wrong with this?
-[sighs] It's a lot of black. Darbs.

614

No.

615
00:29:40.917 --> 00:29:42.375
My God. Burn that.

616
00:29:45.542 --> 00:29:46.875
What's all this stuff?

617
00:29:47.542 --> 00:29:49.542
My mom's old clothes from the '90s.

618
00:29:49.625 --> 00:29:51.167
Retro.

619
00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:53.958
I dig it!

620
00:29:54.042 --> 00:29:55.458

624
00:30:04.583 --> 00:30:06.500
Stay still.

625
00:30:07.458 --> 00:30:08.833
Nope. No.

626
00:30:16.875 --> 00:30:18.583
Congratulations.

627
00:30:18.667 --> 00:30:23.250
You actually look kind of hot!
You need to post a selfie.

628
00:30:24.042 --> 00:30:25.042
To what?

629
00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:28.708
[sighs] What are you. an alien?
Or Amish or something?

Hold it. Find your angles.

-[shutter clicks]

635

it looks like you have jaundice.</i>

[shutter clicking]

638
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:54.292
Using too many emojis comes off
as desperate and thirsty.

639
00:30:54.375 --> 00:30:59.375
But three carefully curated emojis.
radiates sophistication and class.

640
00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:03.458
Eggplants? Penises. Kitty cats? Vaginas.

And a peach is a butt.

642
00:31:06.542 --> 00:31:11.167
Well that certainly changes the meaning of
that text I sent my grandma this morning.

643
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.958
Just keep the captions simple.

Two hours and 88 photos later.

I had six usable selfies
posted to my feed.

If you don't embarrass yourself
on Instagram.

648
00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:27.542
maybe I'll train you on TikTok.

[Capri] I can imagine James
trying to block the party.

00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:35.667
thinking the girls
are only doing it for followers.

653
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.792
-So you'll have to get him on board. okay?
-I'll try.

654

Here it is. Aw. the tree house of love.

00:31:42.792 --> 00:31:44.792
That was our favorite make-out spot.

Barf.

Oh. Mrs. Harris? Hi. it's Darby.
I brought James's homework.

-Just let me clean it up.
-Oh. No worries.

670
00:32:38.542 --> 00:32:40.542
-[sighs]
-He listens to oldies.

671
00:32:40.625 --> 00:32:41.625
Isn't it adorable?

672
00:32:41.708 --> 00:32:44.375
[exhales sharply]
I'm really sorry about Capri.

673
00:32:44.458 --> 00:32:46.917
I know she loved you a lot.

674
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.750
Didn't you hate each other?

675
00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:52.708
Hmm. Love-hate.
We were close when we were younger.

676
00:32:52.792 --> 00:32:56.125
And we still talk. sometimes.
Uh. talked. sometimes.

677
00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:58.958
Oh. Right. I didn't realize that.

678
00:33:00.167 --> 00:33:03.833
[sighs] It's so weird. like I--
I know she's gone.

679
00:33:03.917 --> 00:33:06.125
but it still feels like
she's here with me.

680
00:33:06.208 --> 00:33:09.750
I mean. she was the most kind.
selfless person I've ever met.

681
00:33:09.833 --> 00:33:11.125
Really?

682
00:33:11.208 --> 00:33:15.083
[sighs] I mean. really.
Yeah. I totally get that.

683
00:33:15.167 --> 00:33:17.875
And when I didn't make it past
the blinds on <i>The Voice</i> …

684
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.833
[sighs] …I felt like such a loser.

685
00:33:20.917 --> 00:33:23.417
But when I came back to school.
Capri helped me realize

686
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.292
that failures are just life's way
of making you stronger.

687
00:33:26.833 --> 00:33:28.500
It's true. I was so supportive.

688
00:33:28.583 --> 00:33:30.833
[laughs] I'm sorry. I'm rambling.

689
00:33:30.917 --> 00:33:35.750
No. It's okay. really. I get it.
My mom died when I was seven.

690
00:33:36.708 --> 00:33:40.625
Yeah. I remember. Can't even imagine
how hard that's gotta be.

691
00:33:42.042 --> 00:33:44.250
Yeah. It's just so disorienting.

692
00:33:44.333 --> 00:33:47.708
like. one day your whole world
is flipped upside down

693
00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:50.042
and it feels like
you're on Mars or something.

694
00:33:50.125 --> 00:33:52.208
and you don't know
how to feel normal again.

695
00:33:52.292 --> 00:33:53.292
Yeah.

696
00:33:54.083 --> 00:33:55.583
That's totally how it feels.

697
00:33:56.875 --> 00:33:58.167
Uh. I should go.

698
00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.542
Look. thank you for bringing that over.

699
00:34:00.625 --> 00:34:04.333
It was nice to actually talk to someone.

700
00:34:09.792 --> 00:34:11.042
[ghost] Hey. Darby.

701
00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:14.833
<i>Death has a funny way
of teaching you what's most important.</i>

702
00:34:15.542 --> 00:34:17.708
<i>Like finally making that apology.</i>

703
00:34:17.792 --> 00:34:20.375
<i>Encouraging your child
to embrace who they are.</i>

704
00:34:21.042 --> 00:34:24.000
<i>And the one that always gets me.
that final. "I love you."</i>

705
00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:27.958
<i>The Deados never asked for anything
petty or superficial…</i>

706
00:34:28.042 --> 00:34:29.750
[sighs] <i>…until now.</i>

707
00:34:33.042 --> 00:34:34.083
[Dad] Whoa!

708
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.208
Good morning. sweetheart.

709
00:34:36.292 --> 00:34:39.042
Morning. Don't make it a thing. okay?

710
00:34:39.125 --> 00:34:41.750
It's just a temporary experiment
for social studies.

711
00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:44.625
-It's just--
-What?

712
00:34:45.417 --> 00:34:47.000
You look like your mom.

713
00:34:54.375 --> 00:34:56.875
Okay. this is weird. What is happening?

714
00:34:57.583 --> 00:34:59.833
Who is that? I want her butt.

715
00:34:59.917 --> 00:35:02.750
Damn. smoke show. You got steez.

716
00:35:02.833 --> 00:35:04.583
Who is that? Is that Darby Harper?

717
00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:06.750
-What is everyone looking at?
-You. dummy.

718
00:35:06.833 --> 00:35:08.542
Shoulders back. head up. walk.

719
00:35:10.625 --> 00:35:11.625
Who's the new chick?

720
00:35:13.875 --> 00:35:16.875
[student 8 sighs] That's
head-to-toe vintage. Who's that girl?

721
00:35:16.958 --> 00:35:20.375
I don't know. But she's serving
'90s realness. and I'm so here for it.

722
00:35:20.458 --> 00:35:23.500
Don't scowl. smile a little.
[softly] They like you. Let them in.

723
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.750
Okay. don't smile.
Um. try pouty. Cute pouty.

724
00:35:28.833 --> 00:35:29.958
[grunts] How?

725
00:35:30.667 --> 00:35:34.708
-[student 1] God. she is fire.
-[student 2] Super fresh.

726
00:35:35.792 --> 00:35:38.500
[students chattering in background]

727
00:35:41.792 --> 00:35:43.375
Is she wearing a couch cover?

728
00:35:43.458 --> 00:35:44.708
Hey. [chuckles]

729
00:35:44.792 --> 00:35:48.542
Darby? You look different.

730
00:35:48.625 --> 00:35:50.750
I mean a good different. [laughs]

731
00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:52.417
I mean. you always look great.

732
00:35:52.917 --> 00:35:54.375
-You wanna have a seat?
-Yeah.

733
00:35:54.458 --> 00:35:56.000
-No.
-[electricity crackling]

734
00:35:56.083 --> 00:35:59.958
-[Darby chuckling] Um--
-Darby. no. Absolutely not.

735
00:36:02.375 --> 00:36:04.750
[Taylor] Is she trying to sit
with the new guy?

736
00:36:04.833 --> 00:36:06.708
-No. Uh. no.
-[crackling continues]

737
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.458
-[Darby] Stupid chair. Come on.
-No.

738
00:36:09.542 --> 00:36:12.792
[grunts] You know. I'll just stand.
Yeah. it's better for digestion.

739
00:36:12.875 --> 00:36:15.833
Hey. hey. new girl. You wanna come.
uh. eat lunch with us?

740
00:36:15.917 --> 00:36:18.167
That's Todd.
He's the cutest guy in the cheer squad.

741
00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.042
-You should definitely sit with us.
-No.

742
00:36:20.125 --> 00:36:21.500
Oh.

743
00:36:23.083 --> 00:36:24.333
No. what?

744
00:36:24.958 --> 00:36:28.500
No. I forgot that I have
something to get from my locker.

745
00:36:28.583 --> 00:36:30.042
No time for lunch. [chuckles]

746
00:36:31.458 --> 00:36:34.167
-[sighs]
-Darby! Hey. Darby!

747
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:36.625
-[whispering] What?
-[whispering] What are you doing?

748
00:36:36.708 --> 00:36:38.917
Go sit at Todd's table.
Don't be such a weirdo.

749
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.208
Well. I am a weirdo.

750
00:36:40.292 --> 00:36:43.833
My anonymity was my only means of survival
in this place.

751
00:36:43.917 --> 00:36:46.667
-I'm done.
-No. We have a deal.

752
00:36:47.625 --> 00:36:49.958
[scoffs] Oh. right. Your brilliant plan.

753
00:36:55.292 --> 00:36:56.625
[Darby] Hey.

754
00:36:56.708 --> 00:36:59.333
-What are you doing?
-You wanna know what I was thinking?

755
00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:02.167
Even though you hate me.
I could sit at your table at lunch.

756
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.833
join cheer and we could all
become besties. [laughs]

757
00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:08.792
Have you gone fully mental?

758
00:37:08.875 --> 00:37:10.833
What? You don't wanna be my friend

759
00:37:10.917 --> 00:37:14.208
just 'cause I got a new haircut
and some lip gloss?

760
00:37:14.292 --> 00:37:16.000
Oh. my God.

761
00:37:16.875 --> 00:37:19.167
There. I tried.

762
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.000
Your new style is hideous.

763
00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:24.875
[gasps] You wouldn't know
real fashion if it bit you on the tit.

764
00:37:25.792 --> 00:37:27.208
I thought it was cool.

765
00:37:27.292 --> 00:37:28.875
-I like her socks.
-Guys.

766
00:37:28.958 --> 00:37:30.542
-[snaps]
-What the hell was that back there?

767
00:37:30.625 --> 00:37:33.208
You have zero chill.
You need to get your shit together.

768
00:37:33.292 --> 00:37:35.417
I'm crawling back
into my hermit shell tomorrow.

769
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.000
[sighs] Why are you such a defeatist?

770
00:37:38.917 --> 00:37:41.375
-[Gary] Oh. Darby. what are you doing?
-[grunts]

771
00:37:41.458 --> 00:37:44.083
-You've just left your king wide open.
-Defeatist is right.

772
00:37:44.167 --> 00:37:46.542
This is like watching <i>The Queen's Gambit</i>.
Except she sucks.

773
00:37:46.625 --> 00:37:48.458
-[Gary] Hey. hey. Darby. girl.
-Burn.

774
00:37:48.542 --> 00:37:52.083
Why don't you just do the cheer thing?
You know you want to.

775
00:37:52.167 --> 00:37:54.792
It'll be good. you'll meet new friends.
Ones with pulses.

776
00:37:54.875 --> 00:37:56.792
Yeah. And if you follow my plan.

777
00:37:56.875 --> 00:37:59.000
then you'll earn
their respect organically.

778
00:38:01.542 --> 00:38:02.750
And if I refuse?

779
00:38:02.833 --> 00:38:04.125
-[Gary groans]
-[laughs]

780
00:38:05.875 --> 00:38:07.333
-Oh-- Oh. my--
-[Gary. Mel] Whoa!

781
00:38:07.417 --> 00:38:09.750
Bitch. was that a frog? What the hell!

782
00:38:09.833 --> 00:38:14.167
I've been saving him since science class.
I am not giving up on my party. Darby.

783
00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.667
-There's more where that came from.
-[bell rings]

784
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.542
Damn it! Fine! Fine.

785
00:38:20.625 --> 00:38:22.167
But this is a hostage situation.

786
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.542
and that is on your karma report card.
not mine.

787
00:38:24.625 --> 00:38:26.458
Cheer tryouts are less than a week away.

788
00:38:26.542 --> 00:38:29.333
We're training every day during lunch
and after school. Hey!

789
00:38:29.417 --> 00:38:31.833
Your days of chess and donuts. over.

790
00:38:31.917 --> 00:38:34.583
Donuts. I will miss them.

791
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Hmm.

792
00:38:42.708 --> 00:38:43.792
Four.

793
00:38:45.583 --> 00:38:46.750
You gonna do anything?

794
00:38:47.375 --> 00:38:48.833
Excuse me?

795
00:38:48.917 --> 00:38:50.750
Eight. Nine.

796
00:38:50.833 --> 00:38:54.958
Three. Five. Seven. Again.

797
00:38:55.042 --> 00:38:56.042
Everything okay?

798
00:38:56.833 --> 00:38:58.542
Yeah. just need a sec to focus.

799
00:39:00.125 --> 00:39:03.875
I haven't done this since.
well. you know. since my mom.

800
00:39:22.125 --> 00:39:24.250
-Hey. fresh homework.
-Thanks.

801
00:39:24.333 --> 00:39:25.333
No problem.

802
00:39:28.042 --> 00:39:30.250
[cheering]

803
00:39:30.333 --> 00:39:31.958
[whirring]

804
00:39:42.083 --> 00:39:44.083
[students chattering]

805
00:40:02.458 --> 00:40:05.083
-What's up? Did you hurt your ankle?
-[sighs]

806
00:40:05.167 --> 00:40:08.583
It's fine. It's nothing. I just--
I don't like the beach.

807
00:40:11.875 --> 00:40:13.958
You're gonna kill it at tryouts tomorrow.

808
00:40:14.708 --> 00:40:18.833
You're the best tumbler I've ever seen.
and I've been to Nationals. twice.

809
00:40:22.125 --> 00:40:24.167
Why did you quit when we were younger?

810
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.667
You're honestly a natural.
just like she was.

811
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:28.750
I don't wanna talk about my mother.

812
00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.250
Why?

813
00:40:32.208 --> 00:40:35.250
You know. I used to wish
I had your mom instead of mine.

814
00:40:36.125 --> 00:40:39.292
At least your mom waited
till she was dead to ignore you.

815
00:40:40.583 --> 00:40:43.125
Sometimes I think she might have stayed.

816
00:40:45.375 --> 00:40:48.542
But if she did. then why--
[sighs] Forget it.

817
00:40:49.875 --> 00:40:51.833
If she had stayed. then why what?

818
00:40:51.917 --> 00:40:54.000
I don't wanna talk about my mom. okay?

819
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:58.250
Okay.

820
00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:03.542
Do you wanna scream about her instead?

821
00:41:04.292 --> 00:41:05.583
What?

822
00:41:05.667 --> 00:41:08.417
[shouting] I said.
do you want to scream about her?

823
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.500
Cut it out.

824
00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:14.083
No. I think you'll feel a lot better
if you just scream a little bit!

825
00:41:14.167 --> 00:41:16.292
-[screams]
-Stop.

826
00:41:17.458 --> 00:41:18.667
Come on!

827
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.042
Stop.

828
00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:22.875
[shouting] Are we gonna make
the team tomorrow. Darby Harper?

829
00:41:24.042 --> 00:41:25.292
Yes.

830
00:41:26.583 --> 00:41:30.708
[shouting] I said. are we gonna
make the team tomorrow?

831
00:41:30.792 --> 00:41:33.000
Yes! Yes! Okay?

832
00:41:33.083 --> 00:41:34.792
-Yes!
-Yes!

833
00:41:34.875 --> 00:41:38.250
Okay! That's what I'm talking about!

834
00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:40.333
[screaming]

835
00:41:40.417 --> 00:41:42.917
[shouting] I'm gonna make the team!

836
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.250
[screaming]

837
00:41:45.333 --> 00:41:47.375
You're gonna make the team!

838
00:41:47.458 --> 00:41:50.833
All right. For those of you
who don't know who I am. I am Coach Paula.

839
00:41:50.917 --> 00:41:52.000
You gotta be kidding me.

840
00:41:52.083 --> 00:41:54.417
And we have some very exciting news.

841
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.083
So. without further ado.

842
00:41:56.167 --> 00:41:58.083
-he's your mascot and mine…
-[cheering]

843
00:41:58.167 --> 00:42:00.250
…Douglas The Donut!

844
00:42:00.333 --> 00:42:01.833
-Look at this guy.
-Come on.

845
00:42:01.917 --> 00:42:04.917
-[cheering]
-Oh. my God! So cute. Go. Dougie!

846
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.292
[mouthing words] Oh. wow.

847
00:42:08.667 --> 00:42:11.917
[auditionees chanting]
Time to rumble. time to go nuts!

848
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.042
-Time to cheer for the Fighting Donuts!
-[Paula] She's pretty good.

849
00:42:15.125 --> 00:42:16.250
[cheering]

850
00:42:26.458 --> 00:42:28.875
-[Paula] Oh.
-[Becky] Oh. nice try.

851
00:42:28.958 --> 00:42:29.958
Let me see it.

852
00:42:30.458 --> 00:42:32.125
Show 'em your moneymaker. Darbs.

853
00:42:44.625 --> 00:42:45.625
[Capri] Yay!

854
00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:49.167
Suck on that. Taylor!

855
00:42:50.958 --> 00:42:52.042
-[Paula] Yeah.
-So good.

856
00:42:52.125 --> 00:42:53.542
[applauding]

857
00:42:56.833 --> 00:42:59.042
-You slayed that shit.
-[laughs]

858
00:42:59.125 --> 00:43:01.083
I'm so proud of you. How does it feel?

859
00:43:06.833 --> 00:43:10.333
I actually forgot how empowering it feels.
It's such a high.

860
00:43:10.417 --> 00:43:13.833
I feel like I have lockjaw
from forcing a smile for an hour.

861
00:43:13.917 --> 00:43:16.167
[donut] Great job out there. [grunts]

862
00:43:17.833 --> 00:43:19.792
[laughing] No way.

863
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.542
You-- You know the donut?

864
00:43:22.625 --> 00:43:25.667
Yeah. I never would've thought
cheering was your thing.

865
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:28.375
-You're full of surprises.
-I'm full of surprises?

866
00:43:28.458 --> 00:43:32.333
You weren't kidding when you said you were
gonna find the most ridiculous activity.

867
00:43:32.417 --> 00:43:36.500
Well. it counts as a gym class credit.
I get a free dozen donuts every game.

868
00:43:36.583 --> 00:43:38.917
And. come on. the outfit is sexy as hell.

869
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.333
-[laughs]
-No. no. no. no.

870
00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:43.333
You cannot be friends with the donut.
This is social suicide.

871
00:43:43.417 --> 00:43:46.167
Uh. so--
Uh. update on your stalker situation?

872
00:43:46.917 --> 00:43:49.208
-It's ongoing.
-Ooh. Sorry to hear that.

873
00:43:49.292 --> 00:43:50.833
Step away from the donut.

874
00:43:51.875 --> 00:43:54.167
I'll talk to you later. Okay. Alex?

875
00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.250
Okay.

876
00:43:56.792 --> 00:44:01.458
I mean. that new cheer girl's
just sick on the mat. And cute.

877
00:44:01.542 --> 00:44:05.208
She's not new. That's Darby Harper.
And she's. like. a witch or something.

878
00:44:05.292 --> 00:44:07.208
Yeah. She basically killed Capri.

879
00:44:07.292 --> 00:44:09.333
[Paula] Thank you for your patience.

880
00:44:09.417 --> 00:44:14.250
If I call out your name.
welcome to the Fighting Donuts cheer team.

881
00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:15.333
You made it.

882
00:44:15.417 --> 00:44:19.125
[squeals] Yes! I knew you could do it.
God. I haven't felt this alive since--

883
00:44:19.208 --> 00:44:20.833
-Well. since I was alive.
-[chuckles]

884
00:44:22.167 --> 00:44:24.625
Darby Harper.
is that a smile on your face?

885
00:44:24.708 --> 00:44:27.208
Congrats on making the team. Darbs.
See you on the field.

886
00:44:27.292 --> 00:44:30.208
-Say thanks. weirdo.
-Thanks. weirdo. you. [chuckles]

887
00:44:32.333 --> 00:44:35.875
-How does he know I made the team?
-Probably posted it to IG. Check.

888
00:44:38.333 --> 00:44:40.833
Okay! Look at you with 756 followers.

889
00:44:40.917 --> 00:44:43.333
Congrats.
you're actually becoming a real person.

890
00:44:43.417 --> 00:44:46.500
Now. repost it to your story.
And. um. humble brag.

891
00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:48.333
Pretend like you don't actually care.

892
00:44:48.417 --> 00:44:49.750
Uh. I don't really care.

893
00:44:49.833 --> 00:44:51.875
Perfect! God. you're so good at that.

894
00:44:54.042 --> 00:44:55.167
<i>I actually did care.</i>

895
00:44:56.333 --> 00:44:59.167
<i>I'd finally started making it
in the living world.</i>

896
00:44:59.792 --> 00:45:03.208
<i>but it turns out there are
a lot of rules to being popular.</i>

897
00:45:03.833 --> 00:45:06.083
<i>Don't brag. only humble brag.</i>

898
00:45:06.167 --> 00:45:09.625
<i>It's okay to be moody. but never sad.
Sad is cringe.</i>

899
00:45:09.708 --> 00:45:11.042
<i>Don't try too hard.</i>

900
00:45:11.125 --> 00:45:13.292
<i>Be woke. but not a woke fisher.</i>

901
00:45:13.375 --> 00:45:16.250
<i>Don't be thirsty. Do listen. Do smile.
Speak clearly. Don't be angry.</i>

902
00:45:16.333 --> 00:45:18.833
<i>Be a winner. Don't worry.
Dress to impress. Don't overgram.</i>

903
00:45:18.917 --> 00:45:21.125
<i>I prefer the Deados any day.</i>

904
00:45:21.208 --> 00:45:23.792
<i>Sure. they're dead.
but at least they don't play games.</i>

905
00:45:25.542 --> 00:45:27.750
[inhales deeply. sighs]

906
00:45:27.833 --> 00:45:30.125
The admiration and envy
hang so heavily in the air.

907
00:45:30.208 --> 00:45:32.250
even a dead girl can smell its sweet musk.

908
00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:33.958
[laughing] Hey. hey. Darby!

909
00:45:34.042 --> 00:45:36.042
-Ah! Ah. ah.
-[Todd] I'll check you later.

910
00:45:37.542 --> 00:45:40.917
-[softly] But I have chess with Gary.
-Mm-mmm. Not today. you don't.

911
00:45:42.083 --> 00:45:43.083
[sighs]

912
00:45:43.167 --> 00:45:45.208
-[Cougars chattering. laughing]
-Sit.

913
00:45:48.125 --> 00:45:50.667
[cheering] Full set. Unbelievable.

914
00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:52.875
-Yeah. Cool.
-[inhales deeply]

915
00:45:52.958 --> 00:45:55.292
Say hi.
Jesus Christ. I feel like a ventriloquist.

916
00:45:55.792 --> 00:45:56.833
-Hi.
-[scoffs]

917
00:45:56.917 --> 00:45:58.833
-[jock 1] Hey. Todd.
-[laughs. grunts]

918
00:45:58.917 --> 00:45:59.917
[jock 1] Nice catch. bro.

919
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.208
[Todd] Darby.
You lit that mat on fire. Seriously.

920
00:46:03.292 --> 00:46:05.125
-Welcome to the team.
-[laughing] Thanks.

921
00:46:05.208 --> 00:46:08.458
-Hey. Darby. Looking good.
-Oh. thanks.

922
00:46:08.542 --> 00:46:10.667
Aw! Look at you all flush with endorphins.

923
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:13.833
This is probably the first time
you've experienced popularity. huh?

924
00:46:13.917 --> 00:46:17.750
Own it. girl. Also. smile?
Yeah. you have spinach in your teeth.

925
00:46:17.833 --> 00:46:19.833
-What?
-Phase one of my plan is complete.

926
00:46:19.917 --> 00:46:22.083
You've joined the team
and gained influence.

927
00:46:22.167 --> 00:46:23.167
Now on to phase two.

928
00:46:27.708 --> 00:46:28.875
That's phase two.

929
00:46:31.958 --> 00:46:32.958
Oh. my God.

930
00:46:33.792 --> 00:46:36.542
I swore I had a tampon in here.

931
00:46:36.625 --> 00:46:39.583
She did. I put it in your locker.
[whispering] You're welcome.

932
00:46:39.667 --> 00:46:41.875
I wore white jeans. Do you have anything?

933
00:46:41.958 --> 00:46:43.375
Still trans.

934
00:46:43.458 --> 00:46:44.917
Go on. this is your cue.

935
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.292
-[Bree] Sorry. boo. I don't have any.
-[Taylor] Oh. my God. Come on.

936
00:46:51.625 --> 00:46:52.833
Here. Taylor.

937
00:46:56.042 --> 00:46:57.042
Thanks.

938
00:46:58.125 --> 00:47:01.083
[Capri] Retreat. Retreat!
Act natural. Come on.

939
00:47:03.458 --> 00:47:04.875
[Darby] Yeah.

940
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.625
[clears throat]

941
00:47:07.583 --> 00:47:10.125
So. I guess we have to practice the stunt.

942
00:47:11.167 --> 00:47:13.500
You can come over tomorrow after school.

943
00:47:14.208 --> 00:47:15.625
Yeah. sounds good.

944
00:47:18.458 --> 00:47:21.833
I will see you then. I guess.

945
00:47:55.542 --> 00:47:56.875
[cheering. laughing]

946
00:48:00.333 --> 00:48:03.958
Why the sudden desire
to join cheer. Darby Harper?

947
00:48:04.042 --> 00:48:05.208
Whoa. What's happening?

948
00:48:05.292 --> 00:48:07.583
-She thinks you're an undercover narc.
-Like <i>21 Jump Street</i>.

949
00:48:07.667 --> 00:48:09.583
-She's clean.
-Nice.

950
00:48:09.667 --> 00:48:11.708
Uh-- Say something. Um. something good.

951
00:48:12.583 --> 00:48:14.042
Well. honestly. you guys.

952
00:48:14.125 --> 00:48:17.917
that recruitment skit that you guys did
in gym class really spoke to me.

953
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.583
[exhales sharply] I wrote that.

954
00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:22.542
After I said.
"Let's write a script." [sighs]

955
00:48:22.625 --> 00:48:26.708
And I just thought. "Wow." [chuckles]
I mean. "I wish I had such cool friends."

956
00:48:26.792 --> 00:48:30.042
[laughs] Yeah. we're definitely
an upgrade from that weird donut kid.

957
00:48:30.125 --> 00:48:32.583
-Yeah. Are you dating the donut?
-Squash that. Now.

958
00:48:32.667 --> 00:48:34.792
[stammers]
No. No. I don't really know him.

959
00:48:34.875 --> 00:48:36.792
Ooh. I wonder how James is doing.

960
00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:38.583
Bitch. I will drown you in a toilet bowl

961
00:48:38.667 --> 00:48:40.667
if you think for one second
about dating Jamesy.

962
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:42.542
I think he's coming back to school soon.

963
00:48:42.625 --> 00:48:45.792
It's gonna be so sad
seeing him without Capri.

964
00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:48.417
-I still can't believe that she's gone.
-Here's your in.

965
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:51.625
Um. well.
isn't Capri's birthday coming up?

966
00:48:51.708 --> 00:48:54.792
Do you guys have. I don't know.
anything special planned for it?

967
00:48:54.875 --> 00:48:57.875
Well. she had this big Coachella-themed
party planned.

968
00:48:57.958 --> 00:49:00.250
-Yes. Bree. Keep going.
-It's canceled. obviously.

969
00:49:00.333 --> 00:49:02.833
-[sighs]
-Well. you know. what would be so cool--

970
00:49:02.917 --> 00:49:05.042
Okay. easy. [softly] Don't force it.

971
00:49:05.125 --> 00:49:08.167
Actually. you know what. never mind.
It's none of my business.

972
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:10.083
I wasn't friends with her. I'm gonna go.

973
00:49:10.167 --> 00:49:12.000
Wait. wait. What were you gonna say?

974
00:49:12.667 --> 00:49:14.833
[chuckles] Well. wouldn't it be great

975
00:49:14.917 --> 00:49:16.917
if you guys did something
to celebrate her.

976
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.958
and remember
all of her amazing qualities? Like--

977
00:49:20.042 --> 00:49:21.792
Being named after pants.

978
00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:24.000
Right. But. you know--

979
00:49:24.083 --> 00:49:26.750
There were so many things
about Capri. right? Like--

980
00:49:27.958 --> 00:49:32.000
I mean. she was. uh. pretty and--

981
00:49:32.083 --> 00:49:35.542
Oh! Bossy. Yeah. she was bossy.

982
00:49:35.625 --> 00:49:38.708
Well. anyway.
Wouldn't it be cool if you guys threw

983
00:49:38.792 --> 00:49:41.208
Capri's Sweet Seventeen party
in her honor?

984
00:49:41.292 --> 00:49:45.083
A birthday party for our dead best friend?

985
00:49:45.167 --> 00:49:47.667
[laughs] That seems kind of inappropriate.

986
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:49.375
-Bad form.
-[Bree] Yeah. Super weird.

987
00:49:49.458 --> 00:49:50.792
Uh. followers! Instagram followers.

988
00:49:50.875 --> 00:49:55.833
Well. what if it was to support
accidental electrocution awareness?

989
00:49:55.917 --> 00:49:57.167
-[laughs] What?
-[Taylor] Huh?

990
00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:00.542
I mean. I'm sure it'd make the news
and draw national attention.

991
00:50:00.625 --> 00:50:01.750
Genius.

992
00:50:01.833 --> 00:50:04.042
"Hashtag Capri's Sweet Seventeen."

993
00:50:04.958 --> 00:50:08.583
A celebration of her life.
thrown by her three best friends. [laughs]

994
00:50:08.667 --> 00:50:10.833
Yeah. this could make you guys
legit influencers.

995
00:50:10.917 --> 00:50:11.917
[exhales deeply]

996
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.583
Influencers for accidental
electrocution awareness. of course.

997
00:50:14.667 --> 00:50:16.833
-Oh. Yeah. yeah. yeah. Of course.
-Electrical.

998
00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:18.833
-Yes!
-[grunts]

999
00:50:18.917 --> 00:50:21.083
-[Darby grunts] Oh. I-- Hi. Sorry.
-Uh. Hi. Hi.

1000
00:50:21.167 --> 00:50:22.833
Jelly legs. Eat a banana.

1001
00:50:22.917 --> 00:50:24.500
-I'm gonna stretch.
-Bye.

1002
00:50:24.583 --> 00:50:25.583
Oops.

1003
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.500
We did it.

1004
00:50:32.583 --> 00:50:38.042
Ugh. Honestly. I think the party will be
even more iconic now that I'm dead.

1005
00:50:38.125 --> 00:50:40.583
Ooh. you know. we should
do something special

1006
00:50:40.667 --> 00:50:42.292
at midnight to symbolize you passing on.

1007
00:50:42.375 --> 00:50:45.042
Ooh! Like. uh. releasing a white dove
or something?

1008
00:50:45.125 --> 00:50:46.417
-Oh.
-[Capri] That's fresh.

1009
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:49.208
Yeah. that's cool. I actually
haven't done that for anyone yet.

1010
00:50:50.583 --> 00:50:51.583
You know.

1011
00:50:51.667 --> 00:50:53.583
I used to think
you were such a stuck-up bitch.

1012
00:50:53.667 --> 00:50:55.292
but you're actually kinda cool.

1013
00:50:55.375 --> 00:50:56.417
[chuckles]

1014
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.042
You thought I was a stuck-up bitch?

1015
00:50:58.125 --> 00:50:59.333
Oh. please.

1016
00:50:59.417 --> 00:51:01.875
You acted like you were so edgy and cool.

1017
00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:05.250
and everyone else was basic
and below you or something.

1018
00:51:05.333 --> 00:51:06.417
[chuckles] What?

1019
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.042
Of course. that was before I knew
you were dealing with all this…

1020
00:51:09.708 --> 00:51:10.708
dead people shit.

1021
00:51:12.708 --> 00:51:14.333
Must be very isolating for you.

1022
00:51:15.708 --> 00:51:20.875
Capri Donahue. did you just
express empathy for another person?

1023
00:51:21.542 --> 00:51:25.333
[chuckles] Well. I didn't really
think about it before I died

1024
00:51:25.417 --> 00:51:28.375
but being popular can be isolating too.

1025
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:30.917
Isn't that an oxymoron?

1026
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
No.

1027
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.500
Imagine everyone has
these high expectations of you.

1028
00:51:37.583 --> 00:51:39.250
and you don't wanna disappoint them.

1029
00:51:39.333 --> 00:51:42.250
so you just keep all your imperfections
bottled up inside.

1030
00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:44.208
You have imperfections?

1031
00:51:44.292 --> 00:51:46.792
Well. not my looks
or personality in general. but…

1032
00:51:47.875 --> 00:51:51.417
my mom used to say that I wasn't smart
and that I'd only get by on my looks.

1033
00:51:54.542 --> 00:51:56.750
[chuckles] I've never told anyone that.

1034
00:51:57.875 --> 00:52:00.333
Capri. I think you're smart.

1035
00:52:00.958 --> 00:52:02.917
Like. maybe even dangerously so.

1036
00:52:05.625 --> 00:52:07.042
Thanks.

1037
00:52:07.125 --> 00:52:09.625
I just don't think your looks
are anything to write home about.

1038

-[scoffs]
-[phone buzzes. beeps]

1039
00:52:13.125 --> 00:52:14.750
How are the numbers on the bikini selfie?

1040
00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:17.292
-[Darby sighs]
-Did you Photoshop this?

1041
00:52:17.375 --> 00:52:19.250
-No.
-I can teach you how to Facetune.

1042
00:52:19.333 --> 00:52:20.542
-Okay. It's fine.
-[Darby] Why?

1043
00:52:21.333 --> 00:52:23.042
Ooh! "Slay. Queen!

1044
00:52:23.125 --> 00:52:27.083
You are the hottest girl
to ever walk the halls of FDHS."

1045
00:52:28.292 --> 00:52:29.292
[chuckles]

-[crowd whistling]
-[person] Whoo!

1049
00:52:38.042 --> 00:52:40.167
[Taylor] Let's go Cougars!
Let's go. ladies!

1050
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.417
-Let's go! Come on!
-[Todd] Yeah!

1051
00:52:43.292 --> 00:52:45.375

[shouts]

1055
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.083
[crowd] Darby! Darby! Darby! Darby! Darby!

1056
00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:34.000
-[students chattering]
-[student] Yo!

1057
00:53:34.375 --> 00:53:35.500
Whoo!

1058
00:53:43.708 --> 00:53:45.208
[cheering]

1059
00:53:46.583 --> 00:53:50.500
I am accepted. admired. maybe even adored.

1060
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.125
People who couldn't pick me
out of a lineup a month ago

1061
00:53:53.208 --> 00:53:54.792
now comment with things like--

1062
00:53:54.875 --> 00:53:56.875
Fire emoji. fire emoji.

1063
00:53:56.958 --> 00:53:58.167
Crown emoji.

1064
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:59.458
And--

1065
00:53:59.542 --> 00:54:02.458
Dying! Heart eye emoji.

1066
00:54:02.542 --> 00:54:03.583
And even--

1067
00:54:03.667 --> 00:54:06.625
-Eggplant emoji.
-Water spray emoji.

1068
00:54:07.458 --> 00:54:08.583
Any press is good press.

1069
00:54:09.083 --> 00:54:13.833
Every like. every comment.
every regram is a rush of dopamine.

1070
00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:16.250
I feel a certain sense of power.

1071
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:19.500
And on game nights. I feel extra alive.

1072
00:54:19.583 --> 00:54:24.833
-Ladies and gentlemen!
-["Whoomp. There it is" playing]

1073
00:54:24.917 --> 00:54:30.167
It's time to make the donut!

1074
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:33.000

1075
00:54:33.083 --> 00:54:34.875

00:55:01.417 --> 00:55:02.583
Here we go!

1081
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.708
[Darby] Wait. no!

1082
00:55:14.625 --> 00:55:17.125
[Alex laughing]

1083
00:55:17.208 --> 00:55:18.958
-Dude. [chuckles]
-[Alex] Hello.

1084
00:55:19.042 --> 00:55:20.042
[laughs]

1085
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.542
-You got some moves. huh?
-Yeah. I do.

1086
00:55:22.625 --> 00:55:23.708
[Alex chuckles]

1087
00:55:23.792 --> 00:55:25.583
-[Darby chuckles] Yeah.
-[Alex] Yeah.

1088
00:55:25.667 --> 00:55:27.208
[both laughing]

1089
00:55:27.292 --> 00:55:29.583
Oh. my God.
I haven't laughed this hard in li--

1090
00:55:30.417 --> 00:55:33.375
I've never laughed this hard.
[chuckles] My cheeks hurt.

1091
00:55:33.458 --> 00:55:34.833
Wait. wait. your cheeks hurt?

1092
00:55:34.917 --> 00:55:37.125
At least the padded icing
cushioned your fall.

1093
00:55:37.208 --> 00:55:38.750
[Alex laughing] Okay.

1094
00:55:43.458 --> 00:55:46.333
Look. Darby. there's something
I really wanted to tell you.

1095
00:55:46.417 --> 00:55:48.417
[Todd] Hey. Darby. You coming to the lake?

1096
00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:50.250
-[Darby] Oh. yeah.
-[Todd] Oh. awesome.

1097
00:55:50.333 --> 00:55:51.833
-[Darby chuckles]
-[person] Awesome.

1098
00:55:52.333 --> 00:55:53.958
-Sorry.
-[Alex] Don't be. [chuckles]

1099
00:55:54.042 --> 00:55:56.083
I'm dying to go take
this stupid thing off anyway.

1100
00:55:56.167 --> 00:56:00.417
But. uh. maybe we could
go get a coffee next week?

1101
00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.542
How about Thursday. right after school?

1102
00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:05.167
-Go to Indie Roasters? It's downtown.
-[Darby chuckles]

1103
00:56:06.417 --> 00:56:08.500
-I'll be there.
-Okay.

1104
00:56:08.583 --> 00:56:10.333
Cool. cool. Very cool.

1105
00:56:11.625 --> 00:56:12.625
[Darby chuckles]

1106
00:56:13.125 --> 00:56:14.375
[Todd] Okay. let's take another one.

1107
00:56:14.458 --> 00:56:16.125
-[Bree] Okay. ready? Smile.
-[Todd] Let's go.

1108
00:56:16.208 --> 00:56:19.625
You know you don't have to talk
to the mascot after the game ends. right?

1109
00:56:19.708 --> 00:56:22.583
Oh. yeah. He was just seeing
if I wanted to grab a coffee next week.

1110
00:56:22.667 --> 00:56:23.917
Could you imagine?

1111
00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.917
Douglas The Donut takes you to Starbucks.

1112
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.167
-[Piper] What a scandal.
-[Taylor gasps]

1113
00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:30.333
Oh. my God!

1114
00:56:30.417 --> 00:56:32.375
My uncle said we can use his house
for the party.

1115
00:56:32.458 --> 00:56:33.500
-[Todd] No way.
-Oh. my God.

1116
00:56:33.583 --> 00:56:35.750
You know that giant glass house
on the lake?

1117
00:56:35.833 --> 00:56:37.083
Wait. that's your uncle's house?

1118
00:56:37.167 --> 00:56:40.083
Yeah. Her uncle invented
that crypto banking app. Money Grab.

1119
00:56:40.167 --> 00:56:42.792
[sighs] It's an app that's like a bank

1120
00:56:42.875 --> 00:56:46.292
but instead of going to an actual bank.
you go to the app and like grab money.

1121
00:56:46.375 --> 00:56:48.167
No. Bree. it's an actual bank.

1122
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.042
It's just. like.
the money that isn't real.

1123
00:56:50.125 --> 00:56:52.208
Anyway. it'll be sick for the party.

1124
00:56:52.292 --> 00:56:53.542
Tell 'em how big it is.

1125
00:56:53.625 --> 00:56:56.292
The chandelier has a chandelier.

1126
00:56:56.375 --> 00:56:57.833
-Yeah.
-Guys. let's go to the lake.

1127
00:56:57.917 --> 00:57:00.542
Let's pop some tops. okay? Right?

1128
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:03.917
Oh. Darby can't hang out
on Friday nights. remember?

1129
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.250
-Her daddy wants her home early.
-Yeah.

1130
00:57:06.333 --> 00:57:08.458
[Bree] But the head
of the homecoming committee will be there.

1131
00:57:08.542 --> 00:57:10.292
We can kiss her ass
for a queen nomination.

1132
00:57:10.375 --> 00:57:11.375
It's gonna suck.

1133
00:57:11.917 --> 00:57:13.458
-You should come.
-Uh--

1134
00:57:13.542 --> 00:57:15.042
Don't you have work tonight?

1135
00:57:15.125 --> 00:57:16.375
Isn't that your whole thing?

1136
00:57:16.458 --> 00:57:17.792
-Please?
-Come on. Harper.

1137
00:57:17.875 --> 00:57:19.208
Break the rules.

1138
00:57:19.292 --> 00:57:20.792
-[Todd] Come on. Harper.
-[Piper] Do it.

1139
00:57:20.875 --> 00:57:22.875
-[Taylor] It'll be fun.
-Okay. Just give me a sec.

1140
00:57:22.958 --> 00:57:24.833
-I'm gonna call my dad. okay?
-[Todd] Awesome.

1141
00:57:24.917 --> 00:57:26.917
-Whoo-hoo! Nice.
-Gotta get permission.

1142
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.667
-[Todd] Ooh!
-[Taylor] Okay.

1143
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:30.917
Hey. can you please tell the Deados
something came up

1144
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.917
-and I can't make it tonight?
-What?

1145
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.917
You're really gonna blow off the Deados
just so you can drink hard seltzer

1146
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.708
that literally tastes
like Strawberry Shortcake's butt crack?

1147
00:57:38.792 --> 00:57:40.167
Come on. Please?

1148
00:57:41.083 --> 00:57:44.167
I have literally never taken
a Friday off work before.

1149
00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:45.625
We just won the game.

1150
00:57:45.708 --> 00:57:47.667
I don't feel like hanging
with dead people tonight.

1151
00:57:48.333 --> 00:57:49.333
No offense.

1152
00:57:49.417 --> 00:57:52.042
Okay. well. I don't feel like hanging out
with dead people either.

1153
00:57:52.125 --> 00:57:53.500
Then come with us.

1154
00:57:55.375 --> 00:57:57.125
So I can hide in the bushes
like Michael Myers

1155
00:57:57.208 --> 00:57:59.125
-and watch you guys have fun?
-[car horn honks]

1156
00:57:59.208 --> 00:58:00.708
-No. thank you.
-[horn honks]

1157
00:58:00.792 --> 00:58:02.125
-Come on. Harper!
-[Bree] Come on!

1158
00:58:02.208 --> 00:58:03.208
[Darby] Coming!

1159
00:58:03.292 --> 00:58:06.292
Did you hear that they're using
Taylor's uncle's mansion for the party?

1160
00:58:06.375 --> 00:58:07.500
Great news. right?

1161
00:58:08.167 --> 00:58:09.542
-Yay.
-[cheering]

1162
00:58:09.625 --> 00:58:10.833
[Todd] There you are!

1163
00:58:10.917 --> 00:58:12.500
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-[Taylor] Let's go.

1164
00:58:12.583 --> 00:58:14.542
-[Bree] Party time! All right.
-[Todd] Let's go!

1165
00:58:15.167 --> 00:58:17.833
I'll go back to being a mole person
after the party

1166
00:58:17.917 --> 00:58:22.625
but until then. fooling all the normies
is actually kind of satisfying. [chuckles]

1167
00:58:25.042 --> 00:58:28.000
Shoulders back. head up.

1168
00:58:28.542 --> 00:58:32.292
Although. I won't deny the influencing
has become slightly intoxicating.

1169
00:58:32.375 --> 00:58:35.667
I mean. I had single-handedly
started a fashion trend.

1170
00:58:41.958 --> 00:58:44.417
Me. The invisible girl.

1171
00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.583
The girl no one even realized existed.

1172
00:58:50.125 --> 00:58:51.625
[cheering. laughing]

1173
00:58:53.542 --> 00:58:54.542
[jock] Hey. Darbs.

1174
00:58:54.625 --> 00:58:56.375
Are you stoked for the game on Friday?

1175
00:58:56.458 --> 00:58:57.458
[Capri] "Darbs"?

1176
00:58:57.542 --> 00:59:00.292
I'll be more stoked if you guys
can score a touchdown this time.

1177
00:59:00.375 --> 00:59:01.833
-[gasp. chuckle]
-[Todd] Oh. oh.

1178
00:59:04.458 --> 00:59:05.458
[camera shutter clicks]

1179
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:11.000
Okay. the tent is arriving
Saturday morning.

1180
00:59:11.083 --> 00:59:14.000
DJ Linky Dinky Dog will create
a collaborative playlist on Spotify

1181
00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:15.625
so we can all add our favorite songs.

1182
00:59:16.208 --> 00:59:19.250
-Uh. Capri's favorite songs.
-[Taylor] Got it.

1183
00:59:19.333 --> 00:59:23.167
Uh. Todd is bringing the kegs.
and where are we on the dove?

1184
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:25.583
Oh. my mom ordered us one on Amazon.

1185
00:59:25.667 --> 00:59:28.333
She cried when I told her your plan
to release it at midnight.

1186
00:59:28.417 --> 00:59:31.083
Mmm. it's so poetic. Genius really.

1187
00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:32.500
-[clears throat]
-[Darby] Well.

1188
00:59:32.583 --> 00:59:34.250
I feel like I can't take credit for that.

1189
00:59:34.333 --> 00:59:36.333
I think it's something Capri
would've come up with.

1190
00:59:36.417 --> 00:59:39.375
[scoffs] Uh. no.
She really wasn't that deep.

1191
00:59:39.458 --> 00:59:40.917
-What the f--
-[Darby] Oh. look--

1192
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.875
Look the-- the editor sent me
the final cut of the promo.

1193
00:59:43.958 --> 00:59:45.792
-[Taylor gasps] Ooh.
-I'm gonna post it tonight.

1194
00:59:46.375 --> 00:59:50.208
[promo narrator] <i>This Saturday.
Capri Donahue's Coachella-themed R.I.P.</i>

1195
00:59:50.292 --> 00:59:52.042
<i>Rest In Party.</i>

1196
00:59:53.042 --> 00:59:56.125
<i>A party so epic
they'll hear it in the afterlife.</i>

1197
00:59:56.708 --> 00:59:59.292
<i>Hashtag electrocution awareness week.</i>

1198
00:59:59.375 --> 01:00:00.792

1199
01:00:01.667 --> 01:00:02.500
<i>Party on.</i>

1200
01:00:04.875 --> 01:00:06.292
Iconic. [chuckles]

1201
01:00:06.375 --> 01:00:07.625
Well. I have chills.

1202
01:00:07.708 --> 01:00:11.083
It's literally the best memorial party
promo I have ever seen.

1203
01:00:11.167 --> 01:00:12.208
Right?

1204
01:00:12.292 --> 01:00:13.292
Oh. my God.

1205
01:00:13.792 --> 01:00:14.958
-Oh. my God!
-What? What?

1206
01:00:15.042 --> 01:00:17.583
They just posted
homecoming queen nominations.

1207
01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:19.417
Congrats. girl!

1208
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.792
-[screams]
-[Darby. Capri] What?

1209
01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:23.500
-Uh. no. no. no. That can't be right.
-Oh. my God. You'll totally win.

1210
01:00:23.583 --> 01:00:25.958
Especially because your party
is gonna be the coolest of all time.

1211
01:00:26.042 --> 01:00:28.292
Oh. is it your party now?
Is that what we're calling it?

1212
01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:30.458
[chuckles] My party?
No. guys. it's not my party.

1213
01:00:30.542 --> 01:00:31.542
It's Capri's party.

1214
01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:34.375
-Totally. Of course.
-Yeah. right.

1215
01:00:34.458 --> 01:00:35.458
Not really.

1216
01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:39.500
But I mean.
it's kind of become your party.

1217
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.125
It was your idea.
and you planned the whole thing.

1218
01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:44.000
No. My idea. Taylor.

1219
01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:46.125
-I planned the whole thing!
-Shh!

1220
01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:49.958
Sure. sure.
But it's all for Capri. remember?

1221
01:00:50.042 --> 01:00:52.833
Just tell them I'm here.
I'm so sick of being invisible!

1222
01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:53.958
[electricity crackles]

1223
01:00:54.042 --> 01:00:55.208
[stammers]

1224
01:00:55.292 --> 01:00:57.000
-[Darby] Uh--
-Um. ow.

1225
01:00:57.083 --> 01:00:58.083
-It was a bee.
-Really?

1226
01:00:58.167 --> 01:00:59.625
-It was a bee.
-Did you just do that?

1227
01:00:59.708 --> 01:01:00.792
-[Darby] Yeah.
-You wanna go?

1228
01:01:00.875 --> 01:01:02.625
[Darby] No. I got it.
It was buzzing around.

1229
01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:03.833
-[chuckles]
-[Taylor] Okay.

1230
01:01:03.917 --> 01:01:06.333
You guys should go to the locker room.
I'm gonna warm up.

1231
01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:08.833
Warm up? We just finished practice.

1232
01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:12.250
You don't make it to Nationals
by losing all your warmth. Bree.

1233
01:01:12.917 --> 01:01:13.917
You're weird.

1234
01:01:14.708 --> 01:01:16.292
-But so right.
-Yeah. I am right.

1235
01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:17.375
Whatever. Okay. Bye.

1236
01:01:17.458 --> 01:01:19.167
-Bye. [chuckles]
-[Bree] Goodbye.

1237
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:20.250
Bye.

1238
01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:22.417
-You're my hero.
-Oh.

1239
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.292
[Darby] Are you trying to blow my cover?

1240
01:01:28.375 --> 01:01:30.167
This party's supposed to be my moment.

1241
01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:31.917
You've hijacked it!
It's all about you now!

1242
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
What? No. it's not.

1243
01:01:33.083 --> 01:01:35.208
Capri. there's literally gonna be
a 40-foot projection

1244
01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:37.000
of your face in the night sky.

1245
01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:38.167
Like a friggin' Bat-Signal.

1246
01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:41.417
Yeah. which the homecoming committee
will probably give you credit for.

1247
01:01:41.917 --> 01:01:44.625
I'm not really gonna be homecoming queen.
It's probably just a joke.

1248
01:01:44.708 --> 01:01:46.917
and they're gonna
pour pig's blood on me or something.

1249
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.417
Ew.

1250
01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:51.125
Look. I know it sucks
for you not to be here

1251
01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:52.875
but there's really no need to be jealous--

1252
01:01:52.958 --> 01:01:55.417
No. I'm not jealous.
Don't flatter yourself.

1253
01:01:56.292 --> 01:01:57.917
I'm sleeping at my house this week.

1254
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.917
Good luck picking out a homecoming dress
without me to do it for you.

1255
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.583
[whooshing]

1256
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:05.250
[sighs]

1257
01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:08.208
[Darby] What is it. Gary?

1258
01:02:08.292 --> 01:02:09.708
It's my buddy. Mel.

1259
01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:11.833
He came to see you Friday night.
you weren't there.

1260
01:02:11.917 --> 01:02:13.792
and he's-- he's in a bad way. Darby.

1261
01:02:13.875 --> 01:02:16.750
You know. He says he doesn't feel right.
It's unnatural.

1262
01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:18.875
He's really ready to move on.

1263
01:02:18.958 --> 01:02:22.167
Okay. well. I'm not the border patrol
for the afterlife.

1264
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:23.250
He can go on his own.

1265
01:02:23.333 --> 01:02:24.667
'Course he can. but-but--

1266
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:27.375
See. he needs you to get a--
a message to his kid first.

1267
01:02:27.458 --> 01:02:30.458
He wants to tell him that he's sorry
he didn't accept him as a gay.

1268
01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:32.125
He's not a gay. He's gay.

1269
01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:33.583
Yes. my son. Allen. He's gay.

1270
01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:35.458
And I love him anyway and his husband.

1271
01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:37.583
and I think they're gonna be
great parents.

1272
01:02:37.667 --> 01:02:38.667
Like he said.

1273
01:02:39.917 --> 01:02:41.250
[sighs]

1274
01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:43.792
Gosh. I'm sorry I wasn't there. Mel.

1275
01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:45.500
-[student] Great practice. Darbs.
-Yeah.

1276
01:02:45.583 --> 01:02:46.875
you too. dude. [chuckles]

1277
01:02:48.083 --> 01:02:49.083
Look. [clears throat]

1278
01:02:49.167 --> 01:02:52.042
Come see me Friday night.
I'll be there. I'll help you. okay?

1279
01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:53.458
-Okay.
-[Darby] Promise.

1280
01:02:53.542 --> 01:02:55.042
-Thank you. Darby.
-Thank you. Darby.

1281
01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:02.417
-Hey. Dad.
-Hey.

1282
01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.917
-Take it you're not staying for dinner?
-Uh. no. I gotta go to James's.

1283
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.083
Oh.

1284
01:03:07.167 --> 01:03:10.833
Honey. listen. I am glad
that you're making friends this year.

1285
01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:12.208
But is everything okay?

1286
01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:17.000
I mean… [sighs] …you just don't
seem like yourself anymore.

1287
01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:19.708
God. Dad. I mean.
you pressure me to get a social life.

1288
01:03:19.792 --> 01:03:21.958
and then you give me crap when I have one?

1289
01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:23.458
-Make up your mind.
-Okay.

1290
01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.583
[chuckles] That's valid.

1291
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.167
But. honey. I'm just checking in on you.

1292
01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:30.583
Well. you don't have
to worry about me. 'kay?

1293
01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:32.083
I'm fine. really.

1294
01:03:32.167 --> 01:03:33.667
[chuckles] Same old Darby.

1295
01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.917
Oh. and can I get a studio lighting kit
for my birthday?

1296
01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:42.292
The lamps in my room are a little.
like. warm and cozy. It's gross.

1297
01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:43.958
-Mmm.
-[Darby] You know?

1298
01:03:44.042 --> 01:03:45.708
Anyway. bye.

1299
01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:46.917
Bye.

1300
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:49.833
Yep. same old Darby.

1301
01:03:51.042 --> 01:03:52.042
[sighs]

1302
01:03:52.792 --> 01:03:54.042
[bike bell ringing]

1303
01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:01.583
Did you know that octopus
have three brains?

1304
01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:03.875
Um. wrong.

1305
01:04:03.958 --> 01:04:05.792
-What do you mean?
-I'm not-- I mean. wrong!

1306
01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:07.167
They have nine brains.

1307
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:09.333
Come on. man. The test is next week.

1308
01:04:09.417 --> 01:04:11.042
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

1309
01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:13.250
Hey. uh. look what I found the other day.

1310
01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:14.333
[Darby] Mmm?

1311
01:04:15.792 --> 01:04:17.750
-[chuckles]
-Look at this. Our. uh… [laughs]

1312
01:04:17.833 --> 01:04:19.958
…sixth-grade field trip
to the planetarium.

1313
01:04:20.042 --> 01:04:21.375
-Oh. wow.
-[chuckles]

1314
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.208
Harper and Harris.

1315
01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:25.292
[James chuckles]
I thought you were so cool.

1316
01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:27.750
What? Seriously?

1317
01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:30.375
Yeah. you were so different
from everyone else.

1318
01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:39.125
[sighs] It's going to be so weird to go
back to school without Capri tomorrow.

1319
01:04:40.292 --> 01:04:41.292
[Darby sighs]

1320
01:04:42.167 --> 01:04:45.042
Did you hear about that idiotic
Sweet Seventeen party for her?

1321
01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:49.375
Uh. yeah. yeah.
Think I heard someone talking about that.

1322
01:04:49.458 --> 01:04:52.583
Good to know Taylor. Bree and Piper
are so desperate for attention

1323
01:04:52.667 --> 01:04:55.375
that they're willing
to whore out Capri's memory to get it.

1324
01:04:57.042 --> 01:04:59.000
But isn't it for a good cause?

1325
01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:00.833
Accidental electrocution awareness?

1326
01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:03.208
Which one of those morons
came up with that?

1327
01:05:03.292 --> 01:05:04.292
[chuckles]

1328
01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.625
-Oh. c-cool tree house.
-Yeah.

1329
01:05:08.125 --> 01:05:09.333
Wanna come check it out?

1330
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:14.750
Whoa.

1331
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.833
I haven't been up here since…

1332
01:05:24.042 --> 01:05:27.542
[Darby] I didn't wanna leave my room
for months after my mom died.

1333
01:05:28.667 --> 01:05:29.667
I just…

1334
01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:33.667
I felt like if I just returned
to regular life

1335
01:05:34.667 --> 01:05:36.917
and ignored the fact
that she wasn't there anymore.

1336
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.208
it'd be like living a lie or something.

1337
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.125
But it does get easier. It does.

1338
01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:46.417
And I know you can do this.

1339
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500
Thanks.

1340
01:05:48.792 --> 01:05:49.792
You really get it.

1341
01:05:53.042 --> 01:05:54.750
Why's he looking at me like that?

1342
01:05:54.833 --> 01:05:56.208
[whispers] What's going on?

1343
01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:02.042
Darby. will you come to school
with me tomorrow?

1344
01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.333
U-Uh. yeah. Yeah. I'll be there.

1345
01:06:05.417 --> 01:06:08.958
No. I-- I mean. can I-- can I pick you up?

1346
01:06:09.667 --> 01:06:11.875
It's gonna be tough for me
to face without Capri there

1347
01:06:11.958 --> 01:06:14.583
and. you know.
I could really use someone by my side.

1348
01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:20.917
Sure. sure.
I don't see why not. [chuckles]

1349
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.333
Thanks. Darby.

1350
01:06:23.792 --> 01:06:25.250
-[both chuckle]
-[Darby] Oh.

1351
01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:29.083
[sniffs] Your hair smells so good.

1352
01:06:29.875 --> 01:06:32.042
Thanks. it's shampoo. I gotta go.

1353
01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:33.125
It's getting late.

1354
01:06:33.208 --> 01:06:34.208
-All right.
-Yeah.

1355
01:06:34.292 --> 01:06:35.667
-See you tomorrow?
-Sure.

1356
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:38.083
-Be careful on the way down.
-I'll just leap down.

1357
01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:39.500
-Need help?
-No. I got it.

1358
01:06:39.583 --> 01:06:41.042
[crash]

1359
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.125
[sighs] It's just some environmentally
conscious carpooling. [chuckles]

1360
01:06:48.292 --> 01:06:51.958
You know. Capri will probably thank me
for being there to support him.

1361
01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:53.042
[toilet flushes]

1362
01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:54.833
[Capri] <i>I will drown you in a toilet bowl</i>

1363
01:06:54.917 --> 01:06:57.000
<i>if you think for one second
about dating Jamesy.</i>

1364
01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:02.875
[Dad] Gonna introduce me
to your boyfriend?

1365
01:07:02.958 --> 01:07:04.208
What? Who told you that?

1366
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:08.000
No. no. That's just my biology partner.

1367
01:07:08.083 --> 01:07:12.083
Okay. Well. boyfriend. biology partner.
whatever you kids call it.

1368
01:07:18.917 --> 01:07:20.333
Time to face the music.

1369
01:07:21.667 --> 01:07:23.292
Okay. well. see you in bio.

1370
01:07:23.375 --> 01:07:25.125
Hang on. Will you walk with me?

1371
01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:27.333
Oh. no.

1372
01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:28.833
Sure. James.

1373
01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:37.542
-[student 1] Oh. ho ho!
-[student 2] James Harris is back.

1374
01:07:37.625 --> 01:07:39.833
How'd Darby Harper manage to pull him

1375
01:07:39.917 --> 01:07:41.958
before the bell even rang
on his first day back?

1376
01:07:42.042 --> 01:07:43.958
[student 3] Are they. like. together now?

1377
01:07:44.042 --> 01:07:45.042
James.

1378
01:07:46.417 --> 01:07:48.833
[jock] Well. that's gotta be
the world's fastest rebound.

1379
01:07:48.917 --> 01:07:51.667
James. [chuckles] Welcome back. brother.

1380
01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:56.542
Nothing to see here. folks.
Just me and James Harris.

1381
01:07:57.208 --> 01:07:58.917
Just me and the boy Blake Shelton called.

1382
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.250
"A talented guy
I should have turned my chair for."

1383
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:04.458
Who. I guess. has a crush on me now?
[breathes shakily]

1384
01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:06.792
Nothing out of the ordinary
going on here. [chuckles]

1385
01:08:11.792 --> 01:08:13.417
[student 4] They're holding hands.

1386
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.333
Capri Donahue's gonna drown me
in a toilet bowl.

1387
01:08:15.417 --> 01:08:16.542
[student 5] What?

1388
01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:19.250
So. are you and James. like. a thing now?

1389
01:08:19.333 --> 01:08:22.292
'Cause everyone is saying that
you made out in the hallway this morning.

1390
01:08:22.375 --> 01:08:23.875
No. [sighs] No. we didn't.

1391
01:08:23.958 --> 01:08:26.250
His hand just brushed mine
for a few seconds.

1392
01:08:26.333 --> 01:08:28.292
He's having a hard time
being back without Capri.

1393
01:08:28.375 --> 01:08:30.708
Oh. yes. poor James. The wounded bird.

1394
01:08:30.792 --> 01:08:32.542
Yeah. I would be careful.

1395
01:08:32.625 --> 01:08:35.250
He's so codependent
and definitely on the rebound.

1396
01:08:35.333 --> 01:08:36.958
And morally. it's gross.

1397
01:08:37.042 --> 01:08:39.708
Totally.
Capri's not even cold in her grave yet.

1398
01:08:39.792 --> 01:08:42.208
You guys. it was just
a one-time ride to school.

1399
01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:43.833
-[car horn honks]
-[James] Darby.

1400
01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:45.583
You. uh-- You want a ride home?

1401
01:08:45.667 --> 01:08:47.542
[Darby] No! No. thanks.

1402
01:08:47.625 --> 01:08:51.083
I'm just gonna get my cardio in.
you know? [chuckles]

1403
01:08:51.167 --> 01:08:52.458
All right. well. come by later.

1404
01:08:53.083 --> 01:08:54.083
Wrote a song for you.

1405
01:08:54.792 --> 01:08:56.625
-There's a song.
-Oh. my God.

1406
01:08:56.708 --> 01:08:58.375
Gotta run. You know?

1407
01:08:59.333 --> 01:09:01.000
[Taylor] She's running in that?

1408
01:09:01.083 --> 01:09:02.417
She doesn't live close.

1409
01:09:03.458 --> 01:09:04.625
[sighs] It's Thursday.

1410
01:09:05.125 --> 01:09:06.917
Only two more days till the party.

1411
01:09:08.125 --> 01:09:09.125
[sighs]

1412
01:09:10.375 --> 01:09:12.083
I can lay low until…

1413
01:09:12.875 --> 01:09:15.458
[gasps] Shit. it's Thursday.

1414
01:09:41.208 --> 01:09:42.208
[sighs]

1415
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.708
[Mel] I mean. I used to have crates
of 12-inch vinyl in my den.

1416
01:09:46.792 --> 01:09:50.167
And you could read the liner notes.
you could touch 'em. you could feel 'em.

1417
01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:51.875
But… [stammers] …the music cloud.

1418
01:09:52.375 --> 01:09:53.792
-Where is it? I don't get it.
-Ha!

1419
01:09:53.875 --> 01:09:56.167
Oh. my God! Can you guys stop?

1420
01:09:56.667 --> 01:09:58.667
I cannot believe I'm spending
my junior year

1421
01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.875
listening to some dead boomers

1422
01:10:00.958 --> 01:10:06.042
talking about newspapers and typewriters
and network television.

1423
01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:08.333
Then why don't you just
make up with Darby then?

1424
01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:11.083
I mean. so what?

1425
01:10:11.167 --> 01:10:13.417
She's the Homeroom Queen
and you're not. Big deal.

1426
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.000
That's. uh. Homecoming Queen.

1427
01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:17.083
-Thank you.
-[Gary sighs] Listen. Capri.

1428
01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:18.917
you should be very proud of yourself.

1429
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.958
You were able to pry Darby
out of her shell when no one else could.

1430
01:10:23.042 --> 01:10:26.125
Yeah. well. now she's taking
the attention and credit for my party!

1431
01:10:26.208 --> 01:10:27.208
-Yeah.
-[sighs]

1432
01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:30.500
My sister-in-law. Rose.
sang at my funeral.

1433
01:10:30.583 --> 01:10:33.417
All anybody could talk about
was how great Rose sounded.

1434
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.083
What a great voice Rose had.

1435
01:10:35.167 --> 01:10:37.667
At my funeral!
And you know what they said about me?

1436
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:38.958
"He's looked better."

1437
01:10:39.042 --> 01:10:41.583
-[gasps] The audacity!
-[Gary] Guys. guys. guys.

1438
01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:43.167
Who cares?

1439
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:44.458
You're dead.

1440
01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:47.458
You're throwing a temper tantrum

1441
01:10:47.542 --> 01:10:50.958
about a party in a dimension
that you no longer exist in.

1442
01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.042
Do you know how crazy that is?

1443
01:10:53.125 --> 01:10:54.750
Well. then what's the point?

1444
01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:57.333
What's my purpose?

1445
01:10:57.417 --> 01:11:00.333
Well. you're gonna find that out
on the other side.

1446
01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:03.708
I mean. listen. I have a reason
to stick around. you know?

1447
01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:05.250
I wanna be with Linda.

1448
01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:08.042
But you. you're so young and whip-smart.

1449
01:11:08.125 --> 01:11:09.708
You got your whole death in front of you.

1450
01:11:09.792 --> 01:11:12.417
Why would you wanna stay here
and be invisible?

1451
01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:16.000
You just have to get the heck out of here.

1452
01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:20.583
Thanks. Gary.

1453
01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:22.250
Okay.

1454
01:11:24.208 --> 01:11:26.125
She has a lot of electricity.

1455
01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:28.417
[smacks lips]
You know that's how she died. right?

1456
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.625
[bell rings]

1457
01:11:29.708 --> 01:11:31.333
[Darby] Hey. Alex.

1458
01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:33.917
[sighs] Look. I'm so sorry
about missing our coffee date.

1459
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.083
It's okay.

1460
01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:36.417
Uh. you're busy.

1461
01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:38.833
I hear you're dating James Harris now.

1462
01:11:38.917 --> 01:11:41.417
Oh. no. No. I'm not dating James.

1463
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.000
You could have just texted me.

1464
01:11:43.083 --> 01:11:45.000
I was waiting like 20 minutes.

1465
01:11:46.292 --> 01:11:48.125
[Darby] Uh. look.
I gotta go but I really do--

1466
01:11:48.208 --> 01:11:49.542
Talk to you later. Right.

1467
01:11:54.542 --> 01:11:57.125
[Darby] Hey. Capri. H-How was your Dad's?

1468
01:11:57.208 --> 01:11:58.208
Not great.

1469
01:11:58.292 --> 01:12:01.125
My mom turned my bedroom
into her personal yoga studio.

1470
01:12:01.625 --> 01:12:02.625
-[Darby] Mmm.
-[Capri] So--

1471
01:12:02.708 --> 01:12:04.917
Okay. well. I-I kind of wanna talk to you.

1472
01:12:05.583 --> 01:12:06.583
[Capri] Yeah. sure.

1473
01:12:07.958 --> 01:12:09.375
-[sighs]
-Okay. I'm glad you're here.

1474
01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.583
-There's something I need to tell you.
-Me too.

1475
01:12:11.667 --> 01:12:14.333
I wanted to apologize about
overreacting about the party.

1476
01:12:14.833 --> 01:12:18.542
I've decided that I am proud of your--
our Homecoming nomination.

1477
01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:19.750
I just had to remind myself

1478
01:12:19.833 --> 01:12:21.917
that I'm the Michelangelo
behind your David. you know?

1479
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.875
Great. Well. I have something to tell you.

1480
01:12:23.958 --> 01:12:26.458
but before you freak out.
I want you to let me explain.

1481
01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:28.833
-It's about me and--
-[jock] Good to have you back.

1482
01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:31.042
[gasps] James. Oh. he's at school today.

1483
01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:32.917
Look at him. he's so cute.
Look. he's glowing.

1484
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.417
[Darby chuckles] Okay. Capri.
Listen to me. okay?

1485
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:37.833
There's been a misunderstanding.
You'll think it's funny--

1486
01:12:37.917 --> 01:12:40.292
-There you are. [chuckles. grunts]
-[Darby stammers]

1487
01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:42.458
-I've been looking all over for you.
-[Darby chuckles]

1488
01:12:42.542 --> 01:12:43.958
This too much?

1489
01:12:44.042 --> 01:12:45.833
What the hell is going on?

1490
01:12:45.917 --> 01:12:47.792
[Darby] Uh. okay. How am I gonna do this?

1491
01:12:47.875 --> 01:12:48.958
All right. James.

1492
01:12:49.042 --> 01:12:52.333
I-I can't stop thinking about you
since the other night at my place.

1493
01:12:52.417 --> 01:12:54.625
-Did you hook up with James?
-No.

1494
01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:58.000
I know we both felt something.
and yesterday when you held my hand--

1495
01:12:58.083 --> 01:12:59.458
-You what?
-[Darby] No. no.

1496
01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:01.958
No. I didn't hold your hand.
you held mine.

1497

-Are you okay?

1501
01:13:11.917 --> 01:13:12.917
[Darby] Whoo!

1502
01:13:13.458 --> 01:13:16.042
I know I'm still grieving Capri.
But it just--

1503
01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:17.708
-It just felt good to finally feel…
-Stop.

1504
01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:21.083
…a moment of happiness again.
and it's been so long. and I--

1505
01:13:21.667 --> 01:13:24.042
I think she'd want that.

1506
01:13:24.542 --> 01:13:26.417
No. I really don't think she would.

1507
01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.833

1508
01:13:27.917 --> 01:13:29.917
[Darby] Uh. sorry. James.

1509

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:38.083
Oh. my God. How many times
do I have to tell you?

1511
01:13:38.167 --> 01:13:39.500
Nothing happened.

1512
01:13:39.583 --> 01:13:40.750
You won't admit it.

1513
01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.167
-Not even now.
-Admit what?

that you want to be me.

1519
01:13:53.792 --> 01:13:56.667
[Capri] I'm not worried about James.
He's just trauma-bonding.

1520
01:13:56.750 --> 01:14:01.167

he would actually like you. do you?

1521
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:03.542
[scoffs] Well. that's a little harsh.

1522
01:14:03.625 --> 01:14:05.375
You're not even a real person!

1523
01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:07.667
I created you! I made you!

1524
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:11.042
I dressed you up and told you how to act
so you could be popular.

1525
01:14:11.125 --> 01:14:12.208
But deep down.

1526
01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:16.250

that sees dead people.

1527
01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:20.042
Maybe that's why your mom
didn't wanna come and see you.

1528

her entire life on superficial bullshit.

1533
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.500

to my party tomorrow night.

1548
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.750
you had a little freak out last night.
and I thought I'd check on you.

1549

I've been looking for you.

that's kind of what makes you. you.

Maybe a friend your age could help--

1561
01:15:55.208 --> 01:15:56.792
I'm not talking to Capri.

1562
01:15:57.417 --> 01:15:59.000
She's not my friend. She never was.

1563

Well. yeah. I guess…

of looking at it.

But-- You know. but from a different
point of view.

1567
01:16:11.792 --> 01:16:15.250
maybe she's the one who opened you up
to a whole new world of possibilities.

1568
01:16:15.333 --> 01:16:17.417
She didn't do anything for me.

01:28:38.917 --> 01:28:41.833
Thank you for forcibly

1827
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.958
and. at times. somewhat violently

1828
01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:47.125
pushing me out of my cocoon.

1829
01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:51.792
You are definitely the coolest.
most special-est person I've ever met.

1830
01:28:53.208 --> 01:28:54.875
Right back at you. Seriously.

1831
01:28:54.958 --> 01:28:56.000
Obviously.

1832
01:28:56.083 --> 01:28:57.667
[chuckles]

1833
01:29:09.042 --> 01:29:10.042
[chuckles]

1834
01:29:14.125 --> 01:29:15.250
[sighs]

1835
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:17.417
Bye. bitch.

1836
01:29:30.542 --> 01:29:32.458
[Darby] <i>You know.
I don't consider high school</i>

1837
01:29:32.542 --> 01:29:34.167
<i>to be so torturous anymore.</i>

1838
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:35.250
[James] Hey. Harper.

1839
01:29:35.333 --> 01:29:38.125
<i>My fake boyfriend turned out
to be a real friend.</i>

1840
01:29:38.208 --> 01:29:40.000
-[Darby] Harris.
-Yeah!

1841
01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:41.083
-Whoa!
-[laughs]

1842
01:29:42.292 --> 01:29:43.458
<i>And I stayed in cheer.</i>

1843
01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:47.292
<i>It makes me feel closer
to a couple pretty important people.</i>

1844
01:29:52.458 --> 01:29:53.958
[Gary] Hey. Darby.

1845
01:29:55.667 --> 01:29:56.708
Hey. Gary.

1846
01:29:57.167 --> 01:29:58.208
[Gary] Been a while.

1847
01:29:59.583 --> 01:30:00.583
Uh...

1848
01:30:01.083 --> 01:30:05.000
Listen. I-I wanna apologize
for the way I behaved.

1849
01:30:05.083 --> 01:30:06.750
What are you talking about?
You kidding me?

1850
01:30:06.833 --> 01:30:09.792
Come on. This-- This stuff
can get pretty confusing. right?

1851
01:30:09.875 --> 01:30:11.125
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

1852
01:30:11.208 --> 01:30:12.708
Hey. by the way. you know.

1853
01:30:13.458 --> 01:30:16.583
They took Linda to a hospice.
She doesn't have long.

1854
01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:18.208
Wow.

1855
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:21.167
-Gary. that's fantastic news. [chuckles]
-I know.

1856
01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:24.833
I know. I know. now we can finally
blow this pop stand. and--

1857
01:30:25.583 --> 01:30:26.583
and be together again.

1858
01:30:29.208 --> 01:30:31.042
-[smacks lips]
-Oh. shoot.

1859
01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:34.667
Um. I feel horrible about never
delivering that message for Mel.

1860
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:36.500
-Oh.
-Do you know where his son lives?

1861
01:30:36.583 --> 01:30:40.208
That's okay. the. uh.
the donut took care of that.

1862
01:30:40.292 --> 01:30:41.708
-The what?
-The donut.

1863
01:30:41.792 --> 01:30:42.792
What do you--

1864
01:30:42.875 --> 01:30:46.375
-[Alex] Hey. Gary. Looking good.
-[Gary] Thanks. [chuckles]

1865
01:30:46.458 --> 01:30:49.208
-See you.
-[Alex] Take it easy. man.

1866
01:30:49.292 --> 01:30:50.292
[Darby] What?

1867
01:30:50.375 --> 01:30:52.250
Wait. you can see him too?

1868
01:30:53.708 --> 01:30:55.875
-Yeah.
-Why didn't you tell me?

1869
01:30:55.958 --> 01:30:57.167
I tried.

1870
01:30:57.250 --> 01:30:59.167
My first day here
I saw you talking to Gary.

1871
01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:01.375
But not something you just blurt out.

1872
01:31:01.458 --> 01:31:05.625
Then I tried to get you someplace private
to tell you. and you didn't show up.

1873
01:31:06.708 --> 01:31:07.708
Right.

1874
01:31:07.792 --> 01:31:09.583
Well. but-- but how?

1875
01:31:09.667 --> 01:31:12.667
I was in a coma last year
after a pretty bad car accident.

1876
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:14.000
and when I woke up.

1877
01:31:14.083 --> 01:31:16.792
I became really good friends
with the guy in the bed next to me.

1878
01:31:17.292 --> 01:31:19.333
only to realize he had died
two days earlier.

1879
01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.167
Wow.

1880
01:31:21.250 --> 01:31:23.875
The head shrinker said it was
a psychotic hallucination.

1881
01:31:23.958 --> 01:31:25.292
-My parents freaked out.
-[scoffs]

1882
01:31:25.375 --> 01:31:26.542
Took me out of school.

1883
01:31:27.625 --> 01:31:30.125
I got so good at pretending
not to see the dead

1884
01:31:30.208 --> 01:31:32.500
that the dead didn't even know
I could see them.

1885
01:31:34.292 --> 01:31:36.333
You know. helping Mel cross over.

1886
01:31:36.417 --> 01:31:41.000
it was like. finally.
this curse felt like it could be a gift.

1887
01:31:42.792 --> 01:31:45.792
Yeah. uh. wow.

1888
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:48.042
Look. I just need a second.

1889
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.125
I can't believe this.

1890
01:31:50.208 --> 01:31:52.917
I mean. I've never been able
to talk to anyone about this.

1891
01:31:53.417 --> 01:31:56.667
Well. anyone that's living anyway.
except you. but you're not really here.

1892
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:58.583
You're wherever you are. [chuckles]

1893
01:31:58.667 --> 01:32:00.500
Who are you talk-- Oh.

1894
01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.083
Hi. [chuckles]

1895
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:05.958
Wait. you-- you can see them too?

1896
01:32:06.458 --> 01:32:07.708
Yeah. sure. I see them.

1897
01:32:07.792 --> 01:32:08.958
and I see them.

1898
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.500
And I see you.

1899
01:32:13.708 --> 01:32:15.042
Darby Harper.

1900
01:32:15.125 --> 01:32:16.333
[chuckles]

1901
01:32:17.458 --> 01:32:21.250
Well. I'm reopening my business
and currently taking applications.

1902
01:32:21.333 --> 01:32:24.208
Well. I-I was an assistant manager
at Jamba Juice.

1903
01:32:24.292 --> 01:32:26.083
Wow. impressive.

1904
01:32:26.167 --> 01:32:27.167
Reason for leaving?

1905
01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:29.708
Got committed to a psych ward
for seeing dead people.

1906
01:32:29.792 --> 01:32:31.542
-You're hired.
-It's a date.

1907
01:32:31.625 --> 01:32:32.875
[chuckles]

1908
01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:35.875
[Darby] Oh. G-- [chuckles]

1909
01:32:35.958 --> 01:32:37.042
[laughing]

1910
01:32:37.125 --> 01:32:38.500
That practice killed me.

1911
01:32:38.583 --> 01:32:40.583
[Todd] Yeah. it was brutal. [laughs]

1912
01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:42.625
I got a date with the donut.

1913
01:32:42.708 --> 01:32:43.708
Yeah. you do.

1914
01:32:44.208 --> 01:32:45.708
-Nice.
-That's so sweet.

1915
01:32:45.792 --> 01:32:47.250
-[Todd] Yeah.
-I love you.

1916
01:32:48.667 --> 01:32:49.708
[chuckles]

1917
01:32:52.417 --> 01:32:53.417
[sighs]

1918
01:32:58.917 --> 01:32:59.917
[Darby] Hey. what's that?

1919
01:33:00.417 --> 01:33:03.167
That is a light kit for your videos.

1920
01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:04.708
So you can get your glamour on.

1921
01:33:04.792 --> 01:33:09.375
Oh. [chuckles] Thanks. Dad.
You're the best. But…

1922
01:33:10.292 --> 01:33:11.958
Uh. you can return it though.

1923
01:33:12.042 --> 01:33:14.208
-I'm not making those videos anymore.
-Why not?

1924
01:33:14.292 --> 01:33:18.667
Mostly because social media makes us feel
insecure about the way we look

1925
01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:21.875
for the sole purpose of selling us
stuff we don't need. [chuckles]

1926
01:33:21.958 --> 01:33:25.417
Oh. now that
is the Darby Harper that I know.

1927
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:26.833
-[chuckles]
-[Dad] So.

1928
01:33:26.917 --> 01:33:29.542
are you going out with your friends
for dinner tonight?

1929
01:33:30.417 --> 01:33:35.750
Actually. I was thinking maybe we could
order pizza and share stories.

1930
01:33:40.667 --> 01:33:41.917
[Mom chuckles]

1931
01:33:44.292 --> 01:33:46.208
[Darby] We should do that together.

1932
01:33:46.292 --> 01:33:49.000
[Dad] Mm-hmm. I don't know if I could.

1933
01:33:49.083 --> 01:33:50.542
[Darby] You could.

1934
01:33:52.958 --> 01:33:54.458
Oh. that was before we moved.

1935
01:33:55.083 --> 01:33:56.667
-Yeah.
-That was the best.

1936
01:34:00.708 --> 01:34:02.792
The slide. We should have kept that.

1937
01:34:03.375 --> 01:34:04.708
[speaks indistinctly]

1938
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.917
[sighs] Ah. that was so fun.

1939
01:34:46.833 --> 01:34:47.917
Wait. me too?

1940
01:34:58.208 --> 01:34:59.625
Hey. How are you?

1941
01:34:59.708 --> 01:35:01.208
I'm fine. How are you?

1942
01:35:11.583 --> 01:35:12.708
Get a room.

1943
01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:15.958
[chuckles]
