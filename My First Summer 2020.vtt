3
00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:14.741
(gentle sounds of
crickets and water)

4
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.160
- [Girl] I felt like I'd been
under there my entire life.

5
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.260
Wrapped in yellow
blankets. like a baby.

6
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.020
swaddled too tight.

7
00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:38.099
I was sinking
further and further

8
00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.339
and just when I was about
to run out of breath.

9
00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.679
something pulled me out.

10
00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:48.598
(unsettling music)

11
00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:50.698
Something in the trees.

12
00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.618
A light.

13
00:00:56.338 --> 00:00:58.338
A glow.

14
00:01:01.217 --> 00:01:03.217
(girl sobbing)

15
00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:35.255
(animal pattering)

16
00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:47.694
(dog whimpering)

17
00:02:02.612 --> 00:02:04.272
- [Girl] Is
someone hungry?

18
00:02:04.372 --> 00:02:06.372
Huh?

19
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:16.211
(water gurgling)

20
00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.409
(thoughtful music)

21
00:04:09.362 --> 00:04:11.362
(gate creaking)

22
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080
(beautiful birdsong)

23
00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:51.158
- Hello?

24
00:04:52.838 --> 00:04:55.038
(knocking at door)

25
00:05:07.237 --> 00:05:09.237
(dog barking)

26
00:05:09.637 --> 00:05:11.637
- Tilly...

27
00:05:13.837 --> 00:05:16.456
- Hey

28
00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:18.556
Hello. come here.

29
00:05:19.476 --> 00:05:21.416
(laughing)

30
00:05:21.516 --> 00:05:23.456
Hello.

31
00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:25.556
What's your name?

32
00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:30.315
Tilly. Tilly.

33
00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:34.715
Where are you off to?

34
00:06:10.632 --> 00:06:12.632
Hey...

35
00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.751
It's okay.

36
00:06:23.671 --> 00:06:24.971
Your dog's really cute.

37
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:27.070
- Don't take her.

38
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.710
- I just wanted to
make sure you're okay.

39
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.750
Are you okay?

40
00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:42.869
- How did you know I was here?

41
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.869
- Well. I was there last
night at the reservoir.

42
00:06:53.308 --> 00:06:55.428
(water gurgling)

43
00:06:58.628 --> 00:07:00.628
I saw what happened.

44
00:07:01.908 --> 00:07:03.907
I won't tell anyone.

45
00:07:04.747 --> 00:07:06.747
I pinky promise.

46
00:07:09.747 --> 00:07:11.747
- [Blonde] What are you
doing with your finger?

47
00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:15.866
- Haven't you heard
of a pinky promise?

48
00:07:18.946 --> 00:07:21.766
Well. it means more
than a normal handshake.

49
00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:24.026
(peaceful music)

50
00:07:43.904 --> 00:07:47.144
So. what's your name?

51
00:07:50.584 --> 00:07:52.583
- Claudia.

52
00:07:55.743 --> 00:07:57.743
- I'm Grace.

53
00:08:10.142 --> 00:08:12.142
- What colour are
the other fingers?

54
00:08:13.902 --> 00:08:15.902
If this one is pink. what
colour are the others?

55
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:20.701
- It's not that it's pink. It's
just called your pinky finger.

56
00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:25.041
And the other ones all
have different names.

57
00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:27.141
You know them. right?

58
00:08:27.821 --> 00:08:29.680
- First. second. third-
- Mm mm. mm mm.

59
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.140
Pinky. ring.

60
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.140
Rude.
- What makes it rude?

61
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.479
- No.
- What?

62
00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:42.579
- Just. don't do that.

63
00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:47.159
It's like saying
something really mean.

64
00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:49.259
but with your finger.

65
00:08:55.778 --> 00:08:57.778
Do you wanna come
and sit with me?

66
00:09:21.976 --> 00:09:23.976
Can I come and
visit you sometime?

67
00:09:25.696 --> 00:09:27.836
- No one can know I'm here. If
they find out. they'll take me
away.

68
00:09:27.936 --> 00:09:29.935
- I won't tell anyone.

69
00:09:31.095 --> 00:09:32.155
It can be our secret.

70
00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:35.315
(thoughtful music)

71
00:09:35.415 --> 00:09:37.415
- Purple promise?

72
00:09:42.254 --> 00:09:44.254
- Purple promise.

73
00:09:51.014 --> 00:09:53.173
- [Claudia] It was her. Grace.

74
00:09:57.173 --> 00:09:59.733
The glow on the bank.
The pull from the trees.

75
00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:05.852
She's not of this place.

76
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.030
- Do you want me to have a
nervous breakdown Grace. is that
it?

77
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.270
- No Mom.

78
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.190
- Why the fuck
are the cops here?

79
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.990
- I don't know.

80
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.890
- What the hell you
been up to. young lady?

81
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.670
- I've not done a fucking thing.

82
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.149
- [Dad] Hey. hey listen. hey.

83
00:10:42.249 --> 00:10:44.269
Don't talk to her like that.

84
00:10:44.369 --> 00:10:46.369
- [Officer] We just need
to ask her a few more questions.

85
00:10:56.128 --> 00:10:58.948
Okay. so I'm Detective Croydon.

86
00:10:59.048 --> 00:11:01.048
This is my partner.
Detective Jones.

87
00:11:01.768 --> 00:11:03.888
We just wanted to clarify

88
00:11:06.047 --> 00:11:08.587
what you saw at
the res last night.

89
00:11:08.687 --> 00:11:13.747
- So you saw some
thrashing in the water

90
00:11:13.847 --> 00:11:15.427
and then you said you saw a
girl running away from the res.

91
00:11:15.527 --> 00:11:18.586
And we are not sure who that is.

92
00:11:18.686 --> 00:11:22.786
- See. the deceased didn't
have any kids or family.

93
00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:25.626
So we think that it might
have been a visitor.

94
00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:27.726
or someone from out of town.

95
00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:29.486
Now. is there anything
you can tell us about-

96
00:11:29.566 --> 00:11:31.565
- Look.

97
00:11:33.045 --> 00:11:34.185
- We really need
you to think. okay?

98
00:11:34.285 --> 00:11:36.285
- It's a scorpion in a lollipop.

99
00:11:37.525 --> 00:11:38.745
- [Jones] What'd she look like?

100
00:11:38.845 --> 00:11:41.025
light hair. dark hair.

101
00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:43.124
- Yeah look. I don't
really think I saw a girl.

102
00:11:43.444 --> 00:11:44.944
- No girl?

103
00:11:45.044 --> 00:11:48.024
- No. it was dark.

104
00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:50.104
And I was on my own and
I think I got freaked.

105
00:11:50.204 --> 00:11:52.204
And saw things that
weren't actually there.

106
00:11:53.644 --> 00:11:55.343
I've got a really
overactive imagination.

107
00:11:55.443 --> 00:11:57.023
Mom says it all the time.

108
00:11:57.123 --> 00:11:59.383
- So wait. let me
get this straight.

109
00:11:59.483 --> 00:12:00.743
There was no girl

110
00:12:00.843 --> 00:12:02.143
- But you did say-
- Yeah. I know.

111
00:12:02.243 --> 00:12:04.243
I know.

112
00:12:04.963 --> 00:12:06.622
I'm saying that I
think I got carried away

113
00:12:06.722 --> 00:12:08.942
when I was speaking to
the officer last night.

114
00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:11.042
There was no girl.

115
00:12:11.482 --> 00:12:14.462
But I definitely saw a woman.

116
00:12:14.562 --> 00:12:17.842
an older lady walking into the
water and then the thrashing.

117
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:22.261
- Right...

118
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:25.381
So you saw an older woman
walking into the water

119
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:27.761
- Yeah. that author lady
who lives by the res.

120
00:12:30.281 --> 00:12:32.140
I recognised her from the
back of one of her books.

121
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.220
- Veronica Fox.

122
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.320
- Yeah. That's her.

123
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.320
She just walked into the
water and didn't come out.

124
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.159
It was fucked.

125
00:12:48.479 --> 00:12:50.879
- Well. sounds
about right.

126
00:12:53.199 --> 00:12:55.058
- Cool.

127
00:12:55.158 --> 00:12:56.978
So... I'm good?

128
00:12:57.078 --> 00:12:58.658
I'm not in trouble?

129
00:12:58.758 --> 00:13:00.218
- No.

130
00:13:00.318 --> 00:13:02.178
You're not in trouble.

131
00:13:02.278 --> 00:13:03.738
Like I said. we just wanted
to clarify a few things.

132
00:13:03.838 --> 00:13:04.518
- Cool.
- You've been a big help.

133
00:13:04.598 --> 00:13:06.598
Thank you. Grace.

134
00:13:09.517 --> 00:13:12.437
- Hey. what you saw
must've be really scary.

135
00:13:13.997 --> 00:13:15.997
You got someone to talk to
about it if you need to?

136
00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:19.396
- Yeah.

137
00:13:22.276 --> 00:13:24.276
(gentle music)

138
00:14:16.512 --> 00:14:18.512
- [Woman] Lessons my darling.

139
00:14:21.591 --> 00:14:23.871
(unsettling chiming)

140
00:14:52.709 --> 00:14:54.709
My darling girl. what's wrong?

141
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:57.948
- I don't know.

142
00:14:59.348 --> 00:15:01.348
- Oh my sweet.

143
00:15:01.748 --> 00:15:03.748
You having bad thoughts again?

144
00:15:04.908 --> 00:15:06.908
Oh my darling.

145
00:15:07.348 --> 00:15:09.347
It's okay.

146
00:15:09.907 --> 00:15:12.407
It's okay my darling. it's okay.

147
00:15:12.507 --> 00:15:14.507
Shh. shh. shh.

148
00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:19.067
Sweetheart

149
00:15:20.626 --> 00:15:22.626
Breathing in... and out.

150
00:15:24.786 --> 00:15:26.786
Sweet love. you're
doing so well.

151
00:15:27.106 --> 00:15:29.646
Just breathe in.

152
00:15:29.746 --> 00:15:31.966
Stay with me my
darling. it's all okay.

153
00:15:32.066 --> 00:15:34.205
Shh. shh. shh.

154
00:15:34.305 --> 00:15:36.305
Sweet love. it's okay.

155
00:15:37.065 --> 00:15:38.645
It's okay. stay with me.

156
00:15:38.745 --> 00:15:40.525
Stay with me.

157
00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:42.285
Shh. shh. shh.

158
00:15:42.385 --> 00:15:44.165
My darling. it's okay.

159
00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:45.684
Slow it down. shh. shh. shh.

160
00:15:45.784 --> 00:15:47.784
It's okay.

161
00:15:49.224 --> 00:15:50.804
We're nearly there. my darling.

162
00:15:50.904 --> 00:15:52.904
We are nearly there.

163
00:15:54.344 --> 00:15:58.203
(Grace) Breathe in.

164
00:15:58.303 --> 00:16:00.303
- And out.

165
00:16:00.983 --> 00:16:02.983
Breathe in... and out.

166
00:16:06.223 --> 00:16:08.223
Good. Breathe in... and out.

167
00:16:11.582 --> 00:16:12.682
- Where...
- What?

168
00:16:12.782 --> 00:16:14.782
- Where did my mom go?

169
00:16:15.822 --> 00:16:17.722
What did I do to her?

170
00:16:17.822 --> 00:16:18.382
Nothing. hey Claudia. it's me.

171
00:16:18.462 --> 00:16:19.562
It's me. Grace.

172
00:16:19.662 --> 00:16:21.241
Hey. Remember?

173
00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:22.081
No. no. no. please.

174
00:16:22.181 --> 00:16:23.281
Claudia please.

175
00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:24.201
Come back. Wait.

176
00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:26.501
(unsettling music)

177
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.641
Claudia.

178
00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:33.740
Claudia!

179
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.060
Claudia!

180
00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.540
Claudia!

181
00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:52.019
Claudia! Claudia!

182
00:16:55.979 --> 00:16:57.978
Claudia!

183
00:17:10.297 --> 00:17:12.297
Hey.

184
00:17:14.177 --> 00:17:16.177
Claudia.

185
00:17:16.537 --> 00:17:18.537
- I should be with her.

186
00:17:22.056 --> 00:17:24.056
I should be with her.

187
00:17:32.616 --> 00:17:34.615
- You can't be seen here.

188
00:17:37.935 --> 00:17:39.935
You don't want to
be found do you?

189
00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:44.375
Hey. let's go home.

190
00:17:45.815 --> 00:17:47.814
Yeah?

191
00:17:49.654 --> 00:17:52.794
Let me take you home
where it's safe.

192
00:17:52.894 --> 00:17:54.974
(hopeful music)

193
00:18:50.889 --> 00:18:52.889
Oh. you have to
look in the mirror.

194
00:18:53.329 --> 00:18:54.629
- Why?

195
00:18:54.729 --> 00:18:56.729
- Just do it.

196
00:19:20.727 --> 00:19:22.727
- [Claudia] Can I do you?

197
00:19:24.406 --> 00:19:26.626
- I've got too much
hair. it won't work.

198
00:19:26.726 --> 00:19:28.726
- Get in.

199
00:19:30.126 --> 00:19:32.246
(water splashing)

200
00:20:15.762 --> 00:20:17.582
- You like it here?

201
00:20:17.682 --> 00:20:19.742
- In the tub?

202
00:20:19.842 --> 00:20:21.842
- No. I mean. in this house.

203
00:20:23.601 --> 00:20:25.541
- I guess.

204
00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:27.641
- [Grace] Why don't
you ever leave?

205
00:20:28.001 --> 00:20:30.001
- I've left before.

206
00:20:30.641 --> 00:20:32.541
- I don't think the res counts.

207
00:20:32.641 --> 00:20:34.381
- It's on the outside.

208
00:20:34.481 --> 00:20:37.100
- Yeah. but I mean
like the real outside.

209
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.200
- Mom said there's
nothing but pain there.

210
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.800
- She said that?

211
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.560
- She came from there.

212
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.699
She said that it was
filled with selfish people

213
00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:52.799
who didn't treat
each other very well.

214
00:20:54.959 --> 00:20:56.959
- So you've really
never been past the res?

215
00:20:58.879 --> 00:21:00.978
- Why would I?

216
00:21:01.078 --> 00:21:04.338
- I don't know. to go to school.

217
00:21:04.438 --> 00:21:06.438
see a doctor.

218
00:21:07.038 --> 00:21:09.058
go to your grandparents'
houses and have cups of tea

219
00:21:09.158 --> 00:21:11.278
and listen to the same
story 10 times over.

220
00:21:12.917 --> 00:21:14.177
I mean. I can't
believe it.

221
00:21:14.277 --> 00:21:16.277
(Grace laughs)

222
00:21:17.717 --> 00:21:19.717
- Why are you laughing?

223
00:21:27.756 --> 00:21:29.756
- [Grace] So no one
knows you exist?

224
00:21:34.476 --> 00:21:36.475
- You do.

225
00:21:41.275 --> 00:21:43.275
You can look in the mirror now.

226
00:21:51.674 --> 00:21:53.674
- Hmm. you're
quite good at this.

227
00:21:57.954 --> 00:21:59.954
- Yeah.

228
00:22:00.673 --> 00:22:02.673
(happy music)

229
00:22:12.952 --> 00:22:15.032
- I've never read any
of your mom's books.

230
00:22:18.432 --> 00:22:20.432
I hear they're
really depressing.

231
00:22:23.552 --> 00:22:25.551
- Mom said I'm not allowed
to read them until I turn 18.

232
00:22:26.591 --> 00:22:28.591
- How old are you now?

233
00:22:29.191 --> 00:22:31.191
- 16.

234
00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:38.270
- Same.

235
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.690
Lord. how unutterably
disgusting life is.

236
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.249
What dirty tricks
it plays on us.

237
00:22:49.349 --> 00:22:51.329
Here we are among
the breadcrumbs

238
00:22:51.429 --> 00:22:53.409
and the stained napkins again.

239
00:22:53.509 --> 00:22:54.929
The knife is
already con...

240
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:57.029
- Congealing.

241
00:22:58.469 --> 00:23:00.369
- Congealing with grease.

242
00:23:00.469 --> 00:23:02.468
Disorder. sor...
- Sordidity.

243
00:23:04.708 --> 00:23:08.128
Sordidity and
corruption surrounds us.

244
00:23:08.228 --> 00:23:10.008
Call the waiter. pay the
bill. we must pull ourselves

245
00:23:10.108 --> 00:23:11.048
up out of our chairs.

246
00:23:11.148 --> 00:23:13.088
We must find our coats.

247
00:23:13.188 --> 00:23:14.927
We must go.

248
00:23:15.027 --> 00:23:17.927
- Must. must. must...
detestable word.

249
00:23:18.027 --> 00:23:20.687
- I who had thought
myself immune

250
00:23:20.787 --> 00:23:24.847
find that the wave has tumbled
me over head over heels.

251
00:23:24.947 --> 00:23:28.306
leaving me to summon my forces.
rise and confront the enemy.

252
00:23:39.025 --> 00:23:41.025
Why was that page marked?

253
00:23:42.985 --> 00:23:44.985
- Mom was showing
it to me in class.

254
00:23:45.705 --> 00:23:47.705
- Wow.
- What?

255
00:23:49.025 --> 00:23:51.024
- I thought my mom was fucked.

256
00:23:54.864 --> 00:23:56.604
Sorry.

257
00:23:56.704 --> 00:23:57.684
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

258
00:23:57.784 --> 00:23:59.784
I shouldn't
have said that.

259
00:24:02.303 --> 00:24:04.303
- Mom just felt
everybody's pain.

260
00:24:05.343 --> 00:24:07.343
But she's free now.

261
00:24:17.262 --> 00:24:19.262
What's your mom like?

262
00:24:22.422 --> 00:24:24.082
- Mmm. she kinda sucks.

263
00:24:24.182 --> 00:24:26.181
- Why?

264
00:24:27.101 --> 00:24:29.141
- She just. she has
a lot of problems

265
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:33.341
and her
boyfriend's a dick.

266
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.140
It's quite nice being
away from it all actually.

267
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.420
I like spending
time with you here.

268
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.819
♪ As late as the hour may be ♪

269
00:24:56.979 --> 00:25:00.839
♪ Gimme your love ♪

270
00:25:00.939 --> 00:25:05.358
♪ I need your
love so bad ♪

271
00:25:05.458 --> 00:25:09.238
♪ Gimme your love ♪

272
00:25:09.338 --> 00:25:11.738
♪ I need your
love so bad ♪

273
00:25:18.377 --> 00:25:20.377
(door creaks)

274
00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:34.616
(mystical music)

275
00:25:48.095 --> 00:25:50.095
- Purple. rude.

276
00:25:54.614 --> 00:25:56.614
ring. pinkie.

277
00:27:02.129 --> 00:27:04.488
(man on TV garbling)

278
00:27:13.088 --> 00:27:15.088
- It's a bit late.

279
00:27:19.927 --> 00:27:21.927
Have a seat.

280
00:27:28.886 --> 00:27:30.886
Want a beer?

281
00:27:36.246 --> 00:27:38.706
There you go. it's all right.

282
00:27:38.806 --> 00:27:40.805
It's okay.

283
00:27:45.525 --> 00:27:47.525
So where you been?

284
00:27:51.725 --> 00:27:55.604
- (scoffs) What
like a boyfriend?

285
00:27:59.284 --> 00:28:01.664
Look at you. my little
girl's all grown up.

286
00:28:01.764 --> 00:28:03.764
- I'm not your
little girl. Mike.

287
00:28:09.043 --> 00:28:11.043
- Okay. So do you
have a boyfriend?

288
00:28:12.723 --> 00:28:14.723
It's okay if you do.

289
00:28:15.403 --> 00:28:15.843
I mean are you using
protection. are you-

290
00:28:15.923 --> 00:28:17.922
- Oh stop.

291
00:28:18.682 --> 00:28:20.682
(laughing)

292
00:28:22.882 --> 00:28:23.822
Yeah. goodnight Mike.

293
00:28:23.922 --> 00:28:24.702
- I'm just playing.

294
00:28:24.802 --> 00:28:26.802
- Goodnight.

295
00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.420
I got whatever I could
before Mom woke up.

296
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.900
There's a lot.

297
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.499
There's lollies and chewy.

298
00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:55.699
These are really good.

299
00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:57.339
Oh and lollies
with bugs in them.

300
00:28:57.439 --> 00:28:58.659
- Wait. what's that?

301
00:28:58.759 --> 00:29:00.539
- [Grace] Strawberry milk.

302
00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:02.339
Do you want some?

303
00:29:02.439 --> 00:29:03.419
- Strawberry milk?

304
00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:05.518
- It's really good.

305
00:29:06.198 --> 00:29:08.198
You'll like it.

306
00:29:09.238 --> 00:29:11.238
Purple promise.

307
00:29:16.478 --> 00:29:19.217
(gulping)

308
00:29:19.317 --> 00:29:22.257
Okay no. don't
choke. don't choke.

309
00:29:22.357 --> 00:29:24.577
All right. hang on.

310
00:29:24.677 --> 00:29:26.677
Guess what else I brought?

311
00:29:27.797 --> 00:29:29.996
(imitates fanfare)

312
00:29:40.676 --> 00:29:43.815
- [Claudia] My mother
said the fences

313
00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:45.915
were the walls
of her womb.

314
00:29:49.275 --> 00:29:51.275
Said she could only protect
me if I stayed inside.

315
00:29:55.754 --> 00:29:57.794
away from everyone.
from everything.

316
00:30:04.034 --> 00:30:06.233
(unsettling music)

317
00:30:08.513 --> 00:30:10.673
(water gurgling)

318
00:30:24.512 --> 00:30:26.512
- I made these.

319
00:30:36.631 --> 00:30:38.811
These ones are my favourite.

320
00:30:38.911 --> 00:30:43.170
Brave. Badass.

321
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:45.270
I'm gonna sell them at
the market or something.

322
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.090
They're my ticket outta here.

323
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.330
- Where do you want to go?

324
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.790
Somewhere. Anywhere.

325
00:30:57.749 --> 00:30:59.749
Do you like them?

326
00:31:03.069 --> 00:31:04.969
- [Claudia] They're
very... colourful.

327
00:31:05.069 --> 00:31:07.328
- Okay.

328
00:31:07.428 --> 00:31:09.428
Tell me one thing that
you like about yourself.

329
00:31:13.628 --> 00:31:15.628
Okay...

330
00:31:16.188 --> 00:31:18.187
I'll tell you.

331
00:31:19.787 --> 00:31:21.487
- You hardly know me.

332
00:31:21.587 --> 00:31:23.587
- I know enough.

333
00:31:32.866 --> 00:31:33.606
[Claudia] Smart?

334
00:31:33.706 --> 00:31:35.706
Aren't you?

335
00:31:42.186 --> 00:31:44.185
What else?

336
00:31:58.664 --> 00:32:00.664
Am I pretty?

337
00:32:05.704 --> 00:32:07.703
- [Grace] Now choose your
favourite colour from here.

338
00:32:10.463 --> 00:32:12.463
- I think I like this one.

339
00:32:13.943 --> 00:32:16.123
- Turquoise.

340
00:32:16.223 --> 00:32:18.223
- Turquoise.

341
00:32:18.822 --> 00:32:21.442
Yeah. I like turquoise.

342
00:32:21.542 --> 00:32:23.542
- Okay. what you do.

343
00:32:24.782 --> 00:32:26.782
thread. hold it.

344
00:32:30.422 --> 00:32:32.421
(gentle music)

345
00:32:41.181 --> 00:32:43.180
You're a natural.

346
00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.780
You'll have to help me.

347
00:33:05.219 --> 00:33:07.219
Come on!

348
00:33:08.018 --> 00:33:10.018
It's 200.000 degrees.

349
00:33:18.978 --> 00:33:20.977
Come on.

350
00:33:35.336 --> 00:33:37.336
What's wrong?

351
00:33:40.096 --> 00:33:42.096
The best way to overcome
a fear is to confront it.

352
00:33:42.656 --> 00:33:44.655
I'm serious.

353
00:33:45.175 --> 00:33:46.755
- Right.

354
00:33:46.855 --> 00:33:48.855
- I heard it on the
TV and everything.

355
00:33:51.095 --> 00:33:53.095
Come on.

356
00:33:55.655 --> 00:33:57.654
Come on.

357
00:33:58.854 --> 00:34:00.974
(water splashing)

358
00:34:05.614 --> 00:34:07.833
- Hey. hey.
(Grace laughing)

359
00:34:07.933 --> 00:34:09.933
- You can't tell me
that didn't feel good?

360
00:34:12.813 --> 00:34:14.513
- How deep is it?

361
00:34:14.613 --> 00:34:16.273
- It's not deep.

362
00:34:16.373 --> 00:34:18.373
See?

363
00:34:19.613 --> 00:34:21.612
(giggling)

364
00:34:36.091 --> 00:34:38.091
You're okay.

365
00:34:38.891 --> 00:34:40.891
Come on. I'll help
you through it.

366
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:46.470
- Okay.
- You ready?

367
00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.570
- Don't. Okay.

368
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:52.130
- [Girls] Three. two.

369
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.210
(Claudia yelps)

370
00:34:59.729 --> 00:35:02.349

371
00:35:02.449 --> 00:35:04.449
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

Hey.

Okay breathe in. breathe in.

374
00:35:08.209 --> 00:35:09.908
And out.

375
00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:11.148
Breathe with me.

376
00:35:11.248 --> 00:35:13.248
Hey. breathe with me.

377
00:35:13.568 --> 00:35:15.568
In. out.

378
00:35:18.448 --> 00:35:20.448
Breathe in. out.

379
00:35:24.527 --> 00:35:26.527
Hey.

380
00:35:28.407 --> 00:35:30.407
Hey.

381
00:35:34.526 --> 00:35:36.526
(gentle music)

382
00:35:44.366 --> 00:35:46.185
Keep looking at me.

383
00:35:46.285 --> 00:35:48.285
Okay?
- Okay.

384
00:35:49.885 --> 00:35:51.885
Okay.

385
00:35:54.525 --> 00:35:56.525
Okay.

386
00:35:58.724 --> 00:36:00.724
Three. two. one.

387
00:36:07.644 --> 00:36:09.763

388
00:36:10.523 --> 00:36:12.723

389
00:36:16.363 --> 00:36:17.343

391
00:36:33.162 --> 00:36:35.161
Go ah.

392
00:36:37.481 --> 00:36:39.681
(Grace laughing)

393
00:36:41.481 --> 00:36:43.481
- [Claudia] I'm so bad at this.

394
00:36:44.721 --> 00:36:45.860
(both exclaiming)

395
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.960
[Grace] Did you see that?!

396
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.360
Oh. lucky charm.

397
00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.559
You can have it.

398
00:37:00.999 --> 00:37:02.999
- Can I still eat it?

399
00:37:10.638 --> 00:37:12.638
- Feel lucky?

400
00:37:13.198 --> 00:37:15.198
- Yeah.

401
00:37:28.157 --> 00:37:30.917
I don't really know how
I'm supposed to be feeling.

402
00:37:33.477 --> 00:37:35.476
You make me think

403
00:37:37.636 --> 00:37:40.736
that all the stuff my
mom taught me in class.

404
00:37:40.836 --> 00:37:42.836
about the world being cruel.
about people being monsters.

405
00:37:46.755 --> 00:37:48.755
is all a lie.

406
00:37:56.115 --> 00:37:58.115
- How do you know
I'm not a monster?

407
00:38:00.434 --> 00:38:02.434
- Do you think you are?

408
00:38:06.994 --> 00:38:08.994
- Not many people
like me. though.

409
00:38:17.353 --> 00:38:19.633
- Because monsters only
like other monsters.

410
00:38:34.392 --> 00:38:36.391
Welcome.

411
00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:45.071
I've got that poem
here somewhere.

412
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.710
Okay.

413
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:02.829
'When Day is Over'
by Lesbia Harford.

414
00:39:07.749 --> 00:39:09.749
When day is over I
climb up the stair.

415
00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:13.348
take off my dark dress.
pull down my hair.

416
00:39:15.468 --> 00:39:17.468
open my window and
look at the stars.

417
00:39:19.708 --> 00:39:22.248
Then my heart breaks
through these prison bars

418
00:39:22.348 --> 00:39:24.507
of space and darkness
and finds what is true

419
00:39:27.227 --> 00:39:29.227
Up past the stars
where I'm one with you.

420
00:39:47.425 --> 00:39:49.425
- I like that image

421
00:39:51.265 --> 00:39:53.265
of a heart breaking
through prison bars.

422
00:39:58.705 --> 00:40:00.704
Can I feel it?

423
00:40:01.864 --> 00:40:03.864
- Feel what?

424
00:40:05.264 --> 00:40:07.264
- Your heart.

425
00:40:37.221 --> 00:40:39.221
- Can you hear it?

426
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:41.941
- Yeah.

427
00:40:44.501 --> 00:40:46.501
- Is it okay?

428
00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:50.020
- Yeah.

429
00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:00.859
- It should be
broken. shouldn't it?

430
00:41:05.779 --> 00:41:07.779
- Shock can make you numb and...

431
00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:12.618
- I don't feel numb.

432
00:41:18.098 --> 00:41:20.098
I feel more alive
than I've ever felt.

433
00:41:24.657 --> 00:41:26.937
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said that.

434
00:41:28.657 --> 00:41:30.737
(water gurgling)

435
00:41:40.136 --> 00:41:41.756
- Your mom would
have wanted you to be happy.

436
00:41:41.856 --> 00:41:43.856
- Maybe you should go.

437
00:41:44.456 --> 00:41:46.456
- [Grace] What?

438
00:41:47.656 --> 00:41:49.715
- I need you to go.

439
00:41:49.815 --> 00:41:51.815
I need you to go.

440
00:41:55.135 --> 00:41:57.135
- Claudia-
- I said go.

441
00:41:58.415 --> 00:42:00.415
Go!

442
00:42:01.894 --> 00:42:03.894
Get out!

443
00:42:06.894 --> 00:42:08.894
(door slams)

444
00:42:31.892 --> 00:42:34.552
My mother said there
would come a time

445
00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:36.652
when we would have to leave.

446
00:42:38.131 --> 00:42:40.131
We talked about it for months.

447
00:42:41.971 --> 00:42:45.491
About how we would be
light again. without pain.

448
00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:54.490
But when the time
came. I couldn't do it.

449
00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:01.170
I left her sinking
further and further

450
00:43:05.009 --> 00:43:07.009
and further.

451
00:43:09.289 --> 00:43:11.289

- Grace.

471
00:46:05.034 --> 00:46:07.034
- [Croydon] Hey.
there's a dog here.

472
00:46:09.314 --> 00:46:12.774
- [Jones] Oh. hey.
what's your name buddy?

473
00:46:12.874 --> 00:46:14.574
- Tilly. no.

474
00:46:14.674 --> 00:46:16.673
- Tilly.

475
00:46:17.873 --> 00:46:19.973
Aren't you a
beautiful girl. huh?

476
00:46:20.073 --> 00:46:21.293
See?

477
00:46:21.393 --> 00:46:23.293
I told you it was worth a look.

478
00:46:23.393 --> 00:46:25.393
- Just take her out to the car.

479
00:46:25.713 --> 00:46:27.412
I'll give the place
a bit of a once over.

480
00:46:27.512 --> 00:46:29.252
- Okay.

481
00:46:29.352 --> 00:46:31.352
Come on. come on.

482
00:46:49.031 --> 00:46:51.031

00:47:57.665 --> 00:47:59.665
- Good girl.

486
00:48:03.865 --> 00:48:06.284
What's that?

487
00:48:06.384 --> 00:48:08.384
- [Croydon] Signed copy
of one of her books.

488
00:48:09.264 --> 00:48:10.524
- [Jones] Who's it addressed to?

489
00:48:10.624 --> 00:48:12.724
- Why?

490
00:48:12.824 --> 00:48:14.824
- 'Cause why would she keep
a signed copy of her own book?

491
00:48:17.983 --> 00:48:19.763
- My darling. Claudia.

492
00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:21.083
I love you more
than anything.

493
00:48:21.183 --> 00:48:23.363
You are my world.

494
00:48:23.463 --> 00:48:24.403
- Who's Claudia?

495
00:48:24.503 --> 00:48:26.503
That could be a lead.

496
00:48:27.023 --> 00:48:27.963
- So it's a murder
investigation now?

497
00:48:28.063 --> 00:48:30.062

00:49:42.456 --> 00:49:44.456
Tilly?

503
00:49:47.496 --> 00:49:49.496
- [Jones] You know this dog?

504
00:49:50.456 --> 00:49:53.635
- Yeah. yeah I've been
looking for her all morning.

505
00:49:53.735 --> 00:49:54.755
Where'd you find her?

506
00:49:54.855 --> 00:49:57.315
- Up at Veronica Fox's place.

507
00:49:57.415 --> 00:49:58.755
Any idea what she'd
be doing there?

508
00:49:58.855 --> 00:50:01.035
- Nah.

509
00:50:01.135 --> 00:50:03.135
Nah. we're always finding
her in weird places.

510
00:50:03.735 --> 00:50:05.834
- I've never seen a
dog up at your place.

511
00:50:05.934 --> 00:50:08.334
- Well she's an inside
dog... and she's shy.

512
00:50:27.293 --> 00:50:29.073
Tilly. hey. hey.

513

- Well she looks
happy to see you.

514
00:50:32.972 --> 00:50:34.972
You should put an
address on that collar.

515
00:50:35.692 --> 00:50:37.752
- I will.

516
00:50:37.852 --> 00:50:39.852
Thanks for finding her.

517
00:50:40.652 --> 00:50:42.651

00:53:18.519 --> 00:53:21.678
and just like sighs at
everything with total
satisfaction.

551
00:53:22.638 --> 00:53:24.738
- I can see that.

552
00:53:24.838 --> 00:53:26.938
You'd be wearing a long
dress and lots of jewels.

553
00:53:27.038 --> 00:53:29.178
- Mm. Okay.

554
00:53:29.278 --> 00:53:32.497
(playful music)

555
00:53:32.597 --> 00:53:34.597
Cheers. darling.

556
00:53:39.477 --> 00:53:41.477
(coughing)

557
00:53:43.357 --> 00:53:44.576
- [Claudia] That's disgusting.

558
00:53:44.676 --> 00:53:46.676
- That's so gross.

559
00:53:47.316 --> 00:53:48.096
Wait. wait. wait.

560
00:53:48.196 --> 00:53:49.216
I know how to fix this.

561
00:53:49.316 --> 00:53:51.316
Wait one sec. one sec. one sec.

562
00:53:55.636 --> 00:53:57.635
So.

563
00:53:58.795 --> 00:54:00.255
- What are those?

564
00:54:00.355 --> 00:54:01.935
- We don't have any sugar
cubes or anything. but.

565
00:54:02.035 --> 00:54:03.015
I've got these.

566
00:54:03.115 --> 00:54:05.115
- What do they taste...

567
00:54:06.075 --> 00:54:09.054
Mm. mm. yum.

568
00:54:09.154 --> 00:54:10.814
- [Grace] Yeah.

569
00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:13.774
- So fluffy. like clouds.
- Clouds.

570
00:54:13.874 --> 00:54:14.434
- Like clouds. I know.

571
00:54:14.514 --> 00:54:16.374
So good.

572
00:54:16.474 --> 00:54:18.914

577
00:54:43.672 --> 00:54:45.671

578
00:54:47.631 --> 00:54:49.631
maybe we could
redecorate your room.

579
00:54:50.391 --> 00:54:52.391
- Why?

580
00:54:52.831 --> 00:54:54.771
- You know. for a bit of colour.

581
00:54:54.871 --> 00:54:57.690
I don't know. it feels weird

582
00:54:57.790 --> 00:54:59.790
changing our room so soon.

583
00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:03.410
- Our room?

584
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:05.510
- Yeah. mine and Mom's.

585
00:55:08.909 --> 00:55:12.289
- Oh.

586
00:55:12.389 --> 00:55:13.929
I wouldn't know how to do it.

587
00:55:14.029 --> 00:55:15.449
- [Grace] Do what?

588
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:17.549
- Decorate.

589
00:55:18.149 --> 00:55:22.448
Well. lucky you got me.

590
00:55:22.548 --> 00:55:25.228
(hopeful music)

591
00:55:25.828 --> 00:55:27.828
Okay.

592
00:55:31.588 --> 00:55:33.587
Let's start
with the walls.

593
00:55:35.387 --> 00:55:36.807
- Are we going to paint them?

594
00:55:36.907 --> 00:55:38.907
- Better.

595
00:55:40.067 --> 00:55:41.127
- Do you know all these people?

596
00:55:41.227 --> 00:55:42.567
- I wish.

597
00:55:42.667 --> 00:55:44.127
Here.

598
00:55:44.227 --> 00:55:46.206
- What do we do with them?

599
00:55:46.306 --> 00:55:48.246
- We're gonna stick
them on your walls.

600
00:55:48.346 --> 00:55:50.346
These are your new
guardian angels.

601
00:55:58.465 --> 00:56:00.665
The trick with collaging
is not to overthink it.

602
00:56:03.305 --> 00:56:05.305
Just put 'em up wherever it
feels right and it can be messy.

603
00:56:10.424 --> 00:56:12.424
It's Tavi Gevinson.

604
00:56:13.104 --> 00:56:15.104
- What's she like?

605
00:56:15.544 --> 00:56:17.544
- Clever.

606
00:56:31.783 --> 00:56:33.782
That's Joan Didion and Beyonce.

607
00:56:42.262 --> 00:56:44.262
Okay.
- I love it.

608
00:56:47.301 --> 00:56:49.301
- Now the bed.

609
00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:57.401
- [Claudia] What are you doing?

610
00:56:57.501 --> 00:56:58.480
- You'll see.

611
00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:00.580
Go on. take your covers off.

612
00:57:22.378 --> 00:57:24.458
(clanging in bucket)

613
00:57:26.778 --> 00:57:28.638
- How many do we need?

614
00:57:28.738 --> 00:57:30.738
- I don't know.

615
00:57:33.178 --> 00:57:35.177
I guess it depends how
dark we want the dye to be.

616
00:57:37.337 --> 00:57:39.337
- Not too dark.

617
00:57:41.097 --> 00:57:43.337
- Hope it turns out to be
purple rather than blue.

618
00:57:48.616 --> 00:57:50.616
- [Claudia] Same.

619
00:57:52.256 --> 00:57:54.916
- Well. whatever the colour is.

620
00:57:55.016 --> 00:57:57.016
it'll be way better than white.

621
00:58:05.455 --> 00:58:07.455
(laughs) It's like
a cubby house.

622
00:58:09.055 --> 00:58:11.054

623
00:58:26.493 --> 00:58:29.273

got a prickle.

658
01:01:40.677 --> 01:01:42.677
All right...

659
01:01:44.197 --> 01:01:46.197
This one.

01:01:49.516 --> 01:01:52.136
- Mm. I love this one.

661
01:01:52.236 --> 01:01:54.236
Watermelon.

662
01:01:55.396 --> 01:01:57.256

663
01:01:57.356 --> 01:01:59.356
It's really hard.

664
01:02:03.515 --> 01:02:05.515
It's limited edition.

665
01:02:07.635 --> 01:02:08.375
- Do you give up?

666
01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:10.255
- No. no. I...

667
01:02:10.355 --> 01:02:12.415
- Do you want a hint?

668
01:02:12.515 --> 01:02:17.074
- Yeah.

669
01:02:32.393 --> 01:02:35.013
I've never tasted if before.

670
01:02:35.113 --> 01:02:37.113
- It's cola.

671
01:02:38.072 --> 01:02:40.072
- Cola.

672
01:02:42.112 --> 01:02:44.212
- Do you want another?

673
01:02:44.312 --> 01:02:46.312
Okay.

674
01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:00.191
- Strawberry?

675
01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:06.110
It reminds me of
strawberry milk.

676
01:03:27.668 --> 01:03:29.668
Do you think that someone's
going to come looking for you?

677
01:03:33.068 --> 01:03:35.108
- No one really cares to do
that sort of thing with me.

678
01:03:36.828 --> 01:03:38.827
