IN A WORLD WHERE CHILDREN ARE CRYING.
LAUGHTER CAN ONLY BE CRUEL.

5
00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:22.000
TO ALL THE CHILDREN WHO GROW UP
ALL ALONE ON THE STREETS…

6
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.083
-Hello. welcome.

-Mr. Yasin! Do you have a moment?
-A photo with your wife. please.

9
00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:54.208
-Please.
-Do you have a moment?

10
00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:57.916
Thank you so much.
Could we get one more. please?

11
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:03.458
Welcome. Ms. Aslı.
Would you mind posing for a photo?

12
00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:23.125
Girls. want to go for a ride?

13
00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.875
-Get the fuck out of here!
-Go away!

14
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.000
Come on. boy! Move!

15
00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:41.333
Come on. boy!

16
00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:47.416
Jeez. fucking nutcase. Move. boy!

17
00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.958
Don't stare at me. Go away.

18
00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:32.416
Brother!

19
00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:35.833
Brother?

20
00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:39.875
Mehmet?

21
00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:47.458
Did you collect paper again?

22
00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:53.041
It's like a workout.
I get some fresh air too.

23
00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:54.833
I feel rusty when I sit around.

24
00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:58.625
Workout for what? We collect paper too.
You don't need to exert yourself.

25
00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:00.875
-You're killing yourself!
-I got dizzy.

26
00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.208
Of course you did.
You're trying to kill yourself!

27
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:05.125
I'll be fine.

28
00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:13.791
You're out of medicine. The doctor said
you should sit up straight.

29
00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:14.875
Come here.

30
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.750
Hello? Uncle Tahsin?

31
00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:35.166
Help us! Get out of the way!

32
00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:38.375
-Get out of the way. man! Help us!
-Move…

33
00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:42.708
-Help us! Isn't there a nurse here?
-Take a number.

34
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:46.083
-Where? What?
-From the machine by the door.

35
00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:51.166
I'm asking for help.
You're telling me to take a number.

36
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.000
Don't you fear God?

37
00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:56.041
Hang tight. Can you do it?

38
00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:58.875
Sit up straight. okay?

39
00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:01.375
Okay.

40
00:05:15.708 --> 00:05:17.541
Help us!

41
00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:20.166
Please. help my son! Help!

42
00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:23.750
-He can't breathe.
-Bring a stretcher!

43
00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:26.083
-Be careful.
-Stand back. How is the patient?

44
00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:28.708
-He has a pulse.
-The respiratory tract is open.

45
00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:31.583
He has bradycardia and anisocoria.

46
00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:34.250
-His pulse is dropping.
-Take him to the red zone.

47
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.083
-I promise you. baby. You'll get better!
-Opening vascular access.

48
00:05:39.166 --> 00:05:42.500
-Run a blood test for allergies.
-Right away!

49
00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:47.125
My boy…

50
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.041
My boy…

51
00:06:02.666 --> 00:06:05.541
You'll get better. I promise you.

52
00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:08.958
It will all get better.

53
00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:12.791
NUMBER - COUNTER

54
00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:13.916
Breathe in.

55
00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:16.708
Breathe out.

56
00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:20.666
Breathe in.

57
00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:24.875
Breathe out.

58
00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:29.375
You can get dressed.

59
00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:37.458
You're waiting for a kidney transplant.

60
00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:43.541
You need to hang tight
until a suitable donor is found.

61
00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:46.166
It's your turn for dialysis.

62
00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:50.541
Get an appointment soon.
See your nephrologist too.

63
00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:56.458
I can't take it anymore. Doctor.

64
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.625
Uncle Tahsin!

65
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:06.333
Get in.

66
00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:19.208
The downpour that has started suddenly
this evening is still affecting Istanbul.

67
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:21.583
A yellow alarm has been issued.

68
00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:25.333
You can see the footage of the downpour.
The Meteorological Service…

69
00:07:25.416 --> 00:07:27.125
Did you see the kid. Gonzi?

70
00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:31.125
-What happened to him?
-I don't know. brother.

71
00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:34.916
So. what did the doctor say?

72
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:40.416
The same things. Uncle Tahsin.
I'm still waiting for a kidney.

73
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.166
-And the money?
-I've saved up a lot.

74
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.583
Almost there.

75
00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:49.875
Once they find the kidney.
everything else will be easy.

76
00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:51.875
Exactly.

77
00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:53.958
Why don't you lie down. brother?

78
00:07:56.625 --> 00:08:00.958
-You said I didn't smell? Huh?
-You really don't.

79
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:04.291
Fuck off! I smell so bad.
the doctor's nose fell off.

80
00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:08.041
I don't smell it. at least.

81
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:13.458
You're feeling better already.

82
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:17.041
The doctor gave him morphine.
He'll be pretty high soon.

83
00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:19.625
Isn't he always high anyway?

84
00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:24.833
We need to find a night pharmacy
to get his prescription.

85
00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:26.708
-No problem.
-Thanks.

86
00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:30.833
-When will you go to the hammam?
-The day after tomorrow. Why?

87
00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:33.916
You two smell like shit. boy.

88
00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:38.708
He is right. We smell terrible.

89
00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:39.958
And the roads are--

90
00:08:42.416 --> 00:08:45.500
Uncle. leave it on.
If you don't have any objections.

91
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.916
Yes.

92
00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:51.416
God…

93
00:08:52.916 --> 00:08:57.708
I have an objection to my cruel destiny

94
00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:03.708
I have an objection to this endless agony

95
00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:11.250
To the fickle finger of fate
To the blows dealt by life

96
00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:17.666
To every single trouble

97
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:23.041
I have an objection

98
00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:29.708
To loves that remain unfinished

99
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:35.708
To my borrowed smile

100
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:41.875
To dying before getting to live life

101
00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:46.416
I have an objection

102
00:10:02.291 --> 00:10:05.208
Hey. handsome! Want to have fun?

103
00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:12.000
What's up?

104
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:31.375
Goal!

105
00:12:35.916 --> 00:12:37.041
What is it?

106
00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:38.833
I'm fine. Gonzi.

107
00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:43.958
I'm not coming today.

108
00:12:46.041 --> 00:12:47.041
Just kidding.

109
00:12:47.541 --> 00:12:50.500
I'll be there in five minutes.
Let me finish my breakfast.

110
00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.083
Okay. see you.

111
00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:05.583
Good morning. Sister Hacer.

112
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.083
Keep knitting. Winter's coming.

113
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.708
-Enjoy your food. guys.
-Thanks.

114
00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:16.250
-Have a good day.
-Thanks.

115
00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:21.958
-Have a good day. Brother Hasan.
-Thank you.

116
00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:23.791
-Brother Mehmet!
-What?

117
00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:25.250
Do you have five liras?

118
00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:31.625
You beggars.
have you been waiting for me here? Huh?

119
00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:33.166
No. brother.

120
00:13:35.708 --> 00:13:38.791
You'll buy glue with that money.
won't you? Smartass.

121
00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:41.291
That's not true. We'll buy bread.

122
00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:45.708
-Bullshit. You think I don't know you?
-I swear to God.

123
00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:50.416
Don't swear to God. boy.
He's already punished you enough.

124
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.333
Look at you.

125
00:13:54.458 --> 00:13:55.541
You boys…

126
00:13:57.666 --> 00:13:59.916
You'll be the end of me. Take it.

127
00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:05.583
If I see you sniffing glue.
I'll tear you a new one.

128
00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:07.166
Now. go.

129
00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:21.833
-This is lovely. I told them…
-Oh!

130
00:14:21.916 --> 00:14:24.333
-What's up. Mehmet?
-I'm fine. You?

131
00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:27.333
We're back from the cruising ground.
We just had some pastries.

132
00:14:27.416 --> 00:14:29.166
We have more. Want some?

133
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.333
-I can give them to the kids.
-Okay.

134
00:14:31.416 --> 00:14:33.708
-Do you have a cigarette. Mehmet?
-Sure.

135
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:35.291
-Can I bum one?
-Wait.

136
00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:37.083
-Here.
-Thanks. love.

137
00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:38.458
Take some more.

138
00:14:38.541 --> 00:14:41.166
I'm trying to quit.
I don't even carry a pack with me.

139
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.500
-Alright.
-Wait.

140
00:14:43.458 --> 00:14:45.375
-Thanks. love.
-See you.

141
00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:46.375
-Bye!
-Take care.

142
00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:48.833
Çağla. thanks for the pastries.

143
00:14:56.125 --> 00:14:57.125
Attention!

144
00:14:59.458 --> 00:15:01.583
-What are you all up to?
-Where have you been?

145
00:15:01.666 --> 00:15:03.916
He's here. We thought you wouldn't come.

146
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.708
-I'm here now.
-No worries.

147
00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:11.250
Let's go.

148
00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:14.833
Watch it. Hey.

149
00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:23.750
Here.

150
00:15:23.833 --> 00:15:26.458
-How are you doing. Flea?
-I'm fine.

151
00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:28.791
-Take some pastries.
-Thanks.

152
00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:32.666
Watch out for the boys in blue.
Don't get caught this time.

153
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:37.500
-Good. You look better. boss.
-I thought I was going to die last night.

154
00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:39.875
-Thanks. Gonzi.
-Not at all.

155
00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:43.000
But you shouldn't postpone
going to the doctor.

156
00:15:43.083 --> 00:15:45.000
-Pastries?
-I'll have some.

157
00:15:45.083 --> 00:15:47.000
-Eat before going to work.
-Here.

158
00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:49.541
-Take some.
-Thank you. brother.

159
00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:52.916
-Here. Take as much as you want.
-Eat slowly. You'll choke.

160
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.041
-Have a good day.
-Thank you.

161
00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:58.666
Don't go out to collect paper
because the weather is nice.

162
00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.875
Think of Uncle Tahsin.
He is really worried about you.

163
00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:06.875
Enough. Gonzi.
I'm here. I'm not going anywhere.

164
00:16:08.041 --> 00:16:11.166
I'm just saying.
You almost died last night.

165
00:16:13.666 --> 00:16:14.583
Right.

166
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.291
Dying is not a problem.

167
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.666
But what about the dreams we have?

168
00:16:31.166 --> 00:16:33.500
We have so many of them.
You can't realize them all.

169
00:16:35.541 --> 00:16:38.083
-Don't you remember. you druggie?
-Remember what?

170
00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:39.333
Jeez…

171
00:16:40.583 --> 00:16:41.416
Here.

172
00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:47.958
Only you can read this.

173
00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:53.750
That's the bucket list we made
on your last birthday. remember?

174
00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:56.208
-You still have it?
-Of course.

175
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.208
Why are you bringing it up right now?

176
00:17:00.583 --> 00:17:02.541
Isn't it the right time for it?

177
00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:05.583
If I can't get a kidney.
I'll say. "We were healthy like you once."

178
00:17:05.666 --> 00:17:07.625
"One day. you'll die like us."

179
00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:08.750
-Right.
-Don't say that.

180
00:17:09.416 --> 00:17:10.250
It's true.

181
00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.250
Let's do the list. huh?

182
00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:13.166
Okay.

183
00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.916
-Okay. What does it say here?
-Here. Look.

184
00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:19.666
One.

185
00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:22.166
"Find your mother."

186
00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:25.791
Two…

187
00:17:27.416 --> 00:17:29.583
-What's that…
-You can't read it either.

188
00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:35.083
-Wait. It says. "Ride in a convertible."
-Sure. I've been telling you to jump in.

189
00:17:36.166 --> 00:17:37.875
-Fuck off!
-Fuck you!

190
00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:40.541
Give my cigarette back!
And stay in your zone.

191
00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:44.083
-Don't get your ass handed to you.
-Nobody has an ass like mine!

192
00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:47.625
I'm just giving you a heads-up. You jerk.

193
00:17:58.833 --> 00:18:03.750
FIND YOUR MOTHER. RIDE IN A CONVERTIBLE.
STAY IN A LUXURY HOTEL. TRAVEL BY PLANE

194
00:18:52.541 --> 00:18:57.166
200. 300. 400. 500. 550. 600. 650…

195
00:18:59.333 --> 00:19:00.541
A thousand.

196
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.500
Eighty-three kilos of cardboard.

197
00:19:43.208 --> 00:19:44.083
Okay.

198
00:20:04.916 --> 00:20:06.250
Forty-five kilos.

199
00:20:07.333 --> 00:20:08.166
Here.

200
00:20:10.583 --> 00:20:12.625
-Hey!
-What. you jerk?

201
00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:16.875
-Don't touch those bottles!
-Fuck off. Mind your own business.

202
00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:18.125
Boy…

203
00:20:18.708 --> 00:20:22.041
-Fuck off back to your turf.
-What did you say?

204
00:20:22.125 --> 00:20:24.458
-Boy. look…
-Come here.

205
00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:26.750
-Come here.
-What did you say?

206
00:20:26.833 --> 00:20:28.125
-Come here.
-What?

207
00:20:29.625 --> 00:20:30.625
What?

208
00:20:33.708 --> 00:20:35.166
-Have a good day.
-Thanks.

209
00:20:40.416 --> 00:20:42.041
Come here. boy. Come here.

210
00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:48.000
-You fucking…
-Hey!

211
00:21:03.416 --> 00:21:04.500
Where is he?

212
00:21:05.416 --> 00:21:07.458
-Over here!
-Stop!

213
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:11.166
-You fucking piece of shit!
-Come over here!

214
00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.000
Sixty-one kilos of cardboard.

215
00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:15.166
Here.

216
00:21:15.958 --> 00:21:16.791
Hey!

217
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.291
-What's going on?
-Stop!

218
00:21:25.416 --> 00:21:26.583
Fuck you!

219
00:21:36.916 --> 00:21:39.625
What's wrong. you fucking dipshits?

220
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.916
I'm going to get you eventually.

221
00:21:50.541 --> 00:21:54.541
-Where have you been. man?
-I'm here. I found a treasure.

222
00:21:56.083 --> 00:22:00.458
My dear brothers. this bottle right here
is worth ten liras at the moment.

223
00:22:00.541 --> 00:22:05.500
But it will be worth much more
once Şüko the Smuggler works on it.

224
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:08.875
-How many bottles are there?
-Ten to fifteen.

225
00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:10.041
For real?

226
00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:14.875
You lucky bastard.

227
00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:20.000
-What the hell is that?
-A cigar.

228
00:22:22.458 --> 00:22:27.500
Just look at him.
He is showing off with half of a cigar.

229
00:22:27.583 --> 00:22:31.291
What? A cigar is a cigar. half or not.
You can't miss it. Right. Flea?

230
00:22:31.375 --> 00:22:33.291
-Right.
-Yeah. Off you go.

231
00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:34.208
Okay.

232
00:22:35.166 --> 00:22:37.791
-Good night.
-Good night. Flea.

233
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:41.833
-Take it easy. man. How much is it?
-Fifty-seven kilos of cardboard.

234
00:22:41.916 --> 00:22:42.875
Fifty-seven.

235
00:22:45.125 --> 00:22:47.041
-Here is your deposit.
-Thanks.

236
00:22:47.125 --> 00:22:48.125
-Take this.
-Thanks.

237
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.458
-Let's weigh it.
-Can you do it today?

238
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:57.166
There is a wedding convoy.
I want to go there to beg.

239
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.041
Maybe they'll give me a few liras. Huh?

240
00:23:00.625 --> 00:23:01.708
Okay. I got it.

241
00:23:01.791 --> 00:23:02.625
-Really?
-Yes.

242
00:23:02.708 --> 00:23:04.666
-Take this. then. See you!
-Fuck off.

243
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.541
Hey. Gonzi!
Wash your face. You'll scare people.

244
00:23:08.625 --> 00:23:10.833
-What?
-You jerk.

245
00:23:13.958 --> 00:23:17.625
You can leave too. It's getting late.
The azan has started.

246
00:23:18.875 --> 00:23:20.083
-Here.
-Thanks. brother.

247
00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:21.708
-Here.
-Thanks. brother.

248
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.208
-Thanks.
-See you tomorrow.

249
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:21.000
You fucking rat!

250
00:24:40.583 --> 00:24:41.666
Psst. cat!

251
00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:44.250
Hey!

252
00:24:45.916 --> 00:24:46.916
Get out.

253
00:24:49.458 --> 00:24:51.291
Hey. cat! Get out!

254
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.291
What the hell?

255
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:25.666
Where did you come from? Huh?

256
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:41.250
Okay. don't be scared!
I'm putting it down. It's okay.

257
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.833
Why were you in that sack?
Why did you go in there? Huh?

258
00:25:52.291 --> 00:25:53.291
What's your name?

259
00:25:55.416 --> 00:25:57.833
Speak. boy. Cat got your tongue?

260
00:26:04.833 --> 00:26:06.708
Get off the floor. You'll catch cold.

261
00:26:06.791 --> 00:26:08.500
Fine. Stay there.

262
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:10.875
Okay.

263
00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:14.000
Were you beaten?

264
00:26:16.125 --> 00:26:16.958
Huh?

265
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.875
Hey. are you lost?

266
00:26:26.333 --> 00:26:30.458
-Shall I take you to the police?
-Don't take me to the police. please!

267
00:26:30.541 --> 00:26:34.583
Okay. no police.
Don't cry. We won't go to the police.

268
00:26:36.208 --> 00:26:37.875
Tell me your name. at least.

269
00:26:40.916 --> 00:26:42.333
-Ali.
-What?

270
00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:45.833
-Ali.
-Ali.

271
00:26:48.375 --> 00:26:49.208
Ali.

272
00:26:50.666 --> 00:26:52.125
Who are your parents?

273
00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:54.708
I don't have a father.

274
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.958
And your mother?

275
00:27:07.208 --> 00:27:08.708
Well. are you hungry?

276
00:27:11.416 --> 00:27:12.541
You'll eat. right?

277
00:27:13.416 --> 00:27:14.625
I made rice.

278
00:27:16.208 --> 00:27:19.333
But you can't eat there.
Come to the table to eat comfortably.

279
00:27:19.416 --> 00:27:21.416
My rice is famous. It's perfect.

280
00:27:21.916 --> 00:27:22.750
Come on.

281
00:27:31.291 --> 00:27:35.541
We can eat first.
and then talk about what to do. Okay?

282
00:27:37.208 --> 00:27:38.625
Come on. I'm serving it.

283
00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:41.833
It's ready! Come here.

284
00:27:50.125 --> 00:27:51.333
Okay. don't be scared.

285
00:27:51.958 --> 00:27:54.166
I'm leaving it here. okay?

286
00:27:55.166 --> 00:27:56.041
Okay.

287
00:28:03.208 --> 00:28:04.666
It smells delicious!

288
00:28:07.541 --> 00:28:08.375
Here.

289
00:28:10.666 --> 00:28:11.625
Ketchup.

290
00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:17.250
You won't be full
if you eat rice without ketchup. Okay?

291
00:28:40.875 --> 00:28:42.583
First time eating rice with ketchup?

292
00:28:47.333 --> 00:28:49.333
Well. do you like it?

293
00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:11.041
So. Ali…

294
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.416
will you tell me?

295
00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:16.666
Where did you come from?

296
00:29:18.791 --> 00:29:19.916
Where is your home?

297
00:29:21.125 --> 00:29:21.958
Huh?

298
00:29:29.166 --> 00:29:30.000
Look.

299
00:29:31.791 --> 00:29:34.458
If you don't speak…

300
00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:40.125
we'll have to go to the police.

301
00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:42.250
Please don't.

302
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.750
Did you run away?

303
00:29:50.875 --> 00:29:51.708
Why?

304
00:29:54.208 --> 00:29:55.625
I need to make money.

305
00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:58.291
Money?

306
00:29:59.625 --> 00:30:01.625
Why do you need money at your age?

307
00:30:03.083 --> 00:30:04.666
To save Mom.

308
00:30:06.416 --> 00:30:07.375
From whom?

309
00:30:08.375 --> 00:30:09.375
From my stepfather.

310
00:30:10.958 --> 00:30:12.708
Mom will come to live with me.

311
00:30:15.708 --> 00:30:17.750
Did your stepfather put you in the sack?

312
00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:21.666
No. Mom did.

313
00:30:24.291 --> 00:30:25.125
Ali…

314
00:30:27.083 --> 00:30:29.916
why would a mother
put her child in a stranger's sack?

315
00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:43.375
Your stepfather did it?

316
00:31:19.875 --> 00:31:20.833
Don't be scared.

317
00:31:21.416 --> 00:31:23.958
Wear these shoes. You are barefoot.

318
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.250
They might be a bit small.
but you will make do.

319
00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:34.083
No need to be scared.

320
00:31:36.083 --> 00:31:37.708
Nobody can touch you here.

321
00:31:43.041 --> 00:31:44.041
You know what?

322
00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:49.875
My place is nearby.
You can stay with me tonight.

323
00:31:51.041 --> 00:31:53.541
We'll talk about
what to do tomorrow. okay?

324
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:07.958
-Come in.
-What happened?

325
00:32:08.041 --> 00:32:08.916
Come inside.

326
00:32:09.791 --> 00:32:12.166
-Where were you today?
-Here. What is it?

327
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.375
-Where did you go?
-Why are you whispering? Is someone here?

328
00:32:15.458 --> 00:32:18.958
-Did you leave your zone?
-I went to Cihangir. I didn't do anything.

329
00:32:19.041 --> 00:32:21.708
-Why did you ask me to come--
-Be quiet.

330
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:24.250
Come with me.

331
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.375
Look. This kid came out of your sack.

332
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.666
What am I going to do with him now?

333
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:37.125
-Brother…
-What?

334
00:32:37.916 --> 00:32:39.333
I don't know…

335
00:33:08.916 --> 00:33:10.625
We should go to Uncle Tahsin.

336
00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:15.125
Uncle Tahsin? What are you talking about?

337
00:33:15.625 --> 00:33:19.458
Don't you know him? He'd take the kid
to the police straightaway!

338
00:33:19.541 --> 00:33:22.875
Let him do that!
Does it make sense to keep this kid--

339
00:33:22.958 --> 00:33:26.291
The kid is covered in bruises! Covered!

340
00:33:26.375 --> 00:33:29.291
-They beat him in his home.
-He has a home. at least.

341
00:33:31.166 --> 00:33:35.166
I fucking wish I had a home
where my parents could beat me.

342
00:33:36.375 --> 00:33:38.041
All kids get beaten.

343
00:33:43.291 --> 00:33:45.416
They fucked us up too.

344
00:33:47.375 --> 00:33:49.125
It hasn't been easy for us either.

345
00:33:53.583 --> 00:33:56.208
Take the kid to the police. man.

346
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.166
His mother put him in the sack.

347
00:34:06.125 --> 00:34:09.541
She was so desperate
that she had to leave him.

348
00:34:10.666 --> 00:34:13.166
How can I leave this kid now?

349
00:34:18.916 --> 00:34:19.791
No.

350
00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:24.708
I won't leave this kid
without finding out the truth first.

351
00:34:28.625 --> 00:34:31.833
What if the woman regrets it
and goes to the police?

352
00:34:31.916 --> 00:34:36.291
She knows where she left him.
They will fuck me up. not you.

353
00:34:36.791 --> 00:34:40.208
He was in my sack. Give him up.

354
00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:42.708
You can't take care
of yourself. for fuck's sake.

355
00:34:42.791 --> 00:34:44.125
Don't bring a kid into it.

356
00:34:47.375 --> 00:34:50.541
Give him up. for God's sake.

357
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.875
Will you? Huh?

358
00:35:01.541 --> 00:35:02.708
Say something.

359
00:35:05.958 --> 00:35:07.541
-Swear to me.
-What?

360
00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:10.708
-Swear to me.
-Don't make me swear--

361
00:35:10.791 --> 00:35:14.708
-Swear to me! You won't tell Uncle Tahsin.
-Brother…

362
00:35:14.791 --> 00:35:18.291
Swear to me you won't.
I'll tell him if I have to.

363
00:35:18.375 --> 00:35:20.708
-Swear to me. Gonzi.
-Okay.

364
00:35:20.791 --> 00:35:24.458
-I said swear to me!
-Fine. I swear!

365
00:35:24.541 --> 00:35:25.833
-I swear!
-Okay.

366
00:35:25.916 --> 00:35:27.708
-I swear. Stop.
-Okay.

367
00:35:27.791 --> 00:35:28.791
-Okay?
-Okay.

368
00:35:28.875 --> 00:35:30.750
I swear. Okay.

369
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:36.000
-I swear.
-Okay. Alright. man. okay.

370
00:35:36.083 --> 00:35:38.041
-I'm letting you go. okay.
-Right.

371
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.625
-Okay. alright. Okay.
-Okay.

372
00:35:46.625 --> 00:35:47.708
Okay.

373
00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:04.291
-You're going to the hammam?
-It's bathing day. How much are these?

374
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.291
-Fifty liras.
-Fifty.

375
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:15.666
Do you have summer shorts and shirts
for an eight or nine-year-old boy?

376
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.208
-Sure. Wait here.
-Alright.

377
00:36:41.083 --> 00:36:42.083
You…

378
00:36:45.083 --> 00:36:46.750
I saw you at the hospital.

379
00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:49.125
Is your son okay?

380
00:37:07.791 --> 00:37:10.583
Mehmet. these will fit him.

381
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.166
They will be fine.

382
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:16.916
-Okay. How much?
-Just 40 liras.

383
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.333
Here.

384
00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:25.166
Thanks.

385
00:37:39.291 --> 00:37:40.708
Slow the fuck down.

386
00:37:41.958 --> 00:37:43.666
It's too hot!

387
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.500
Man. you still stink.

388
00:37:54.166 --> 00:37:56.250
Give me that bowl. Here.

389
00:37:56.333 --> 00:37:58.041
It's hot!

390
00:37:58.625 --> 00:38:02.000
You need to pour it slowly. you idiot!

391
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:04.625
Who are they?

392
00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:07.666
My parents.

393
00:38:08.166 --> 00:38:10.958
-Have you ever seen them?
-No.

394
00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:15.000
-So?
-Can't I dream about them either?

395
00:38:15.666 --> 00:38:18.791
Hey! Don't throw water. boy!

396
00:38:18.875 --> 00:38:20.208
Stop it!

397
00:38:20.291 --> 00:38:22.416
Wait! Attack. man!

398
00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:24.791
-God!
-Memo!

399
00:38:25.708 --> 00:38:27.000
Take that!

400
00:38:27.666 --> 00:38:29.291
Here. Throw water at them.

401
00:38:30.625 --> 00:38:33.125
Go on! Go ahead!

402
00:38:33.208 --> 00:38:34.375
Stop it.

403
00:38:34.458 --> 00:38:36.166
Not at me. at them!

404
00:38:39.125 --> 00:38:40.500
Wait a minute. man.

405
00:38:42.333 --> 00:38:44.375
Okay. enough!

406
00:38:44.458 --> 00:38:47.208
If you like playing with water.
I can take you to the sea.

407
00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:50.458
-Sure! Will you teach me how to swim?
-Don't you know how?

408
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.708
-Nope.
-Of course I will.

409
00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:55.166
The bath bowl is made of silver

410
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:58.041
He's just come back
From doing you-know-what

411
00:38:58.125 --> 00:39:00.541
The bath bowl is made of silver

412
00:39:00.625 --> 00:39:03.208
He's just come back
From doing you-know-what

413
00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:06.208
The one who put me in this trouble

414
00:39:06.875 --> 00:39:09.000
Is your. is your

415
00:39:09.083 --> 00:39:14.333
Your. your. your. your
Your lousy uncle

416
00:39:14.416 --> 00:39:17.041
Oh. baby. baby

00:39:17.125 --> 00:39:20.666
Weaver girls. oh. baby. baby

418
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:22.625
The bath bowl is made of silver

419
00:39:32.708 --> 00:39:34.125
We are nice and clean.

420
00:39:35.541 --> 00:39:37.791
Well. now…

421
00:39:39.125 --> 00:39:40.000
Comb.

422
00:39:44.875 --> 00:39:46.833
Let's see. And here…

423
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.000
It looks nice. Are you hungry?

424
00:39:53.375 --> 00:39:56.000
-What should we eat? Gonzi!
-Yes. brother?

425
00:39:56.083 --> 00:39:58.666
-We're hungry.
-What should we eat?

426
00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.083
How about a hamburger?

427
00:40:00.916 --> 00:40:01.750
Yes!

428
00:40:03.458 --> 00:40:07.791
Okay. Thank you. They look delicious.
Give us your blessing.

429
00:40:10.333 --> 00:40:13.500
-Here you go.
-We have fries too! Great!

430
00:40:13.583 --> 00:40:14.583
Here you go. Ali.

431
00:40:15.458 --> 00:40:16.458
Take these fries.

432
00:40:23.458 --> 00:40:25.375
-What are we doing tonight?
-What?

433
00:40:26.916 --> 00:40:30.791
-Isn't it your birthday?
-Wait. What are you talking about?

434
00:40:30.875 --> 00:40:33.666
Does anyone
in our group know their birthdays?

435
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.375
No. Gonzi.

436
00:40:39.375 --> 00:40:41.458
Man. play along.

437
00:40:42.958 --> 00:40:48.416
We can have a party for Ali tonight.
We can invite the kids. play some music…

Get a cake from Hüseyin.

439
00:40:50.708 --> 00:40:51.916
Good idea.

440
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.458
-It'll be fun. He'll enjoy it.
-Okay.

441
00:40:54.541 --> 00:40:58.083
-Okay? Let everyone know.

Invite everyone. Get some musicians too.

444
00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:08.000
Ali. what kind of cake do you like?

445
00:41:08.083 --> 00:41:12.083
-Me?
-Yes. Chocolate. strawberry. banana?

446
00:41:13.458 --> 00:41:15.541
-How about chocolate?
-Chocolate?

447
00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:22.000
It looks good.

448
00:41:26.833 --> 00:41:29.625
Gonzi. you guys wait here.
I'll be right back.

449

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:39.958
-How are you. Hüseyin?
-The same.

452
00:41:40.625 --> 00:41:43.875
Is there anything we can get?
We have a birthday party tonight.

453
00:41:43.958 --> 00:41:47.458
-Whose turn is it?
-It doesn't matter. Everyone gets a party.

454
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:49.750
-Right. Come on in.
-Thanks.

455
00:41:52.083 --> 00:41:53.041
What flavor?

456
00:41:55.208 --> 00:41:58.708
-They aren't old. are they?
-No. three days tops.

457
00:41:58.791 --> 00:42:02.333
-Okay. What's this one?
-I made it two days ago. Croquant.

458
00:42:02.416 --> 00:42:04.666
-So. it's pretty good?
-Right.

459
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:09.041
Let me get that.
Could you give me some candles for it too?

460
00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:11.416
-Of course.
-Brother!

461
00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.333
Ali?

462
00:42:13.416 --> 00:42:15.708
Ali? What happened to you?

463
00:42:15.791 --> 00:42:18.416
-A lady tried to kidnap me.
-What?

464
00:42:20.458 --> 00:42:22.583
-Where is Gonzi?
-I don't know.

465
00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:26.291
Come here. Who was it?

466
00:42:28.416 --> 00:42:32.291
Who was it. Ali? Which one? Show me!

467
00:42:37.083 --> 00:42:40.833
-Was it you?
-Are you high? Why are you shouting?

468
00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:42.625
Who did it?

469
00:42:45.958 --> 00:42:46.791
Ali…

470
00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:50.625
Don't be scared. I'm here. okay?

471
00:42:50.708 --> 00:42:53.333
Brother. I found a great bottle--

472
00:42:54.708 --> 00:42:56.750
Why did you leave him all alone?

473
00:42:56.833 --> 00:42:58.833
-I checked the trash--
-Fuck the trash!

474
00:42:58.916 --> 00:43:03.375
Somebody tried to take him.
What if they succeeded. Gonzi?

475
00:43:04.541 --> 00:43:05.708
Brother. my throat…

476
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:07.708
Brother Mehmet?

477
00:43:11.333 --> 00:43:12.333
Ali?

478
00:43:16.291 --> 00:43:17.291
Okay. let's go.

479
00:43:18.833 --> 00:43:19.833
Come on.

480
00:43:23.291 --> 00:43:24.791
I have slippers!

481
00:43:24.875 --> 00:43:27.750
We'll have a birthday party tonight.
Are you excited?

482
00:44:16.208 --> 00:44:17.583
Did you pee?

483
00:44:32.958 --> 00:44:34.000
Oh!

484
00:44:35.291 --> 00:44:36.666
Oh no!

485
00:44:38.291 --> 00:44:39.333
Well…

486
00:44:41.833 --> 00:44:43.583
Whose birthday is it today?

487
00:44:43.666 --> 00:44:45.333
-Mine!
-Mine!

488
00:44:45.416 --> 00:44:49.833
Fuck off! Didn't we celebrate
your birthday just recently?

489
00:44:49.916 --> 00:44:52.416
We can do it again.
It's free to make a wish.

490
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:56.875
Of course we can do it again.
We can celebrate the fuck out of it!

491
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:00.666
Good for you. brother!

492
00:45:01.166 --> 00:45:03.375
-Gonzi?
-Yes. brother?

493
00:45:04.208 --> 00:45:05.291
Is the cake ready?

494
00:45:06.083 --> 00:45:06.958
I'll bring it.

495
00:45:17.625 --> 00:45:20.333
-What's going on. you nutjobs?
-Wow!

496
00:45:25.958 --> 00:45:29.625
-Don't blow without making a wish.
-Do I get to blow?

497
00:45:30.791 --> 00:45:32.625
We let the young ones go first.

498
00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:37.041
Make a wish. everyone.

499
00:45:44.458 --> 00:45:46.416
-You made your wish?
-Yes.

500
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.541
Go ahead.

501
00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:54.208
Hey. don't laugh.

502
00:45:59.041 --> 00:46:00.375
Let's try together.

503
00:46:02.166 --> 00:46:03.000
Come on.

504
00:46:05.166 --> 00:46:08.208
One. two. three.

505
00:46:10.666 --> 00:46:13.208
-Good job!
-Good job!

506
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.083
It's good.

507
00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:23.416
Do you like it?

508
00:46:24.333 --> 00:46:26.458
-It's delicious.
-Yeah.

509
00:46:30.333 --> 00:46:31.250
What are your wishes?

510
00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:34.000
He swallowed it whole.

511
00:46:34.083 --> 00:46:36.208
My wish is to see Mom.

512
00:46:37.833 --> 00:46:43.291
You wish the same thing every year.
You should change it up. Come on.

513
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.041
My wish is to die.

514
00:46:50.666 --> 00:46:54.166
Why? You are a young man.
Why would you want to die?

515
00:46:54.666 --> 00:46:57.750
You have many years ahead of you.
You'll be a grown man.

516
00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.666
Why do you wish to die?

517
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:03.833
You know how my mom died
when I was little?

518
00:47:03.916 --> 00:47:04.791
Yes?

519
00:47:06.208 --> 00:47:10.916
If I die when I'm older.
she won't be able to recognize me.

520
00:47:15.208 --> 00:47:16.708
She won't. right?

521
00:49:04.416 --> 00:49:05.708
What's your wish?

522
00:49:06.791 --> 00:49:08.916
To have Mom here with me.

523
00:49:10.958 --> 00:49:12.041
We can do that.

524
00:49:14.083 --> 00:49:15.833
I need to save up first.

525
00:49:17.541 --> 00:49:19.083
How much do you need?

526
00:49:19.791 --> 00:49:21.666
Enough to bring her to live with me.

527
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:25.875
Can I work too?

528
00:49:28.958 --> 00:49:30.500
Let's sleep on it.

529
00:49:30.583 --> 00:49:34.833
-Will you teach me how to swim tomorrow?
-Of course I will.

530
00:49:34.916 --> 00:49:36.166
Where will we go?

531
00:49:37.833 --> 00:49:39.041
To Sarayburnu.

532
00:49:39.875 --> 00:49:43.125
There is a strong current.
but that's where I learned to swim.

533
00:49:43.916 --> 00:49:47.000
But you'll listen to me.
It's not too deep anyway.

534
00:49:47.083 --> 00:49:51.166
Mom will be so happy to see
that I can swim. you know?

535
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.000
Of course! Absolutely.

536
00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.875
-Brother Mehmet?
-Mm?

537
00:49:55.958 --> 00:49:58.041
Do you love your mom?

538
00:49:58.708 --> 00:50:00.541
Everyone loves their mom. Ali.

539
00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:02.833
Where is she?

540
00:50:03.541 --> 00:50:04.583
Far away.

541
00:50:05.208 --> 00:50:08.541
Why don't you go to her if you love her?

542
00:50:09.041 --> 00:50:10.291
I will. Ali.

543
00:50:11.416 --> 00:50:12.416
I will.

544
00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:14.375
Soon enough.

545
00:50:35.291 --> 00:50:36.291
Ali?

546
00:50:46.541 --> 00:50:47.583
Ali?

547
00:50:56.833 --> 00:50:57.791
Ali!

548
00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:02.791
Ali!

549
00:51:06.416 --> 00:51:07.416
Ali!

550
00:51:12.833 --> 00:51:13.916
Çağla.

551
00:51:15.666 --> 00:51:18.458
Have you seen Ali?
The boy I had with me last night?

552
00:51:18.541 --> 00:51:21.250
-What happened. dear?
-Did you see him or not. dammit?

553
00:51:21.333 --> 00:51:24.291
We swear we didn't. girl. He is crazy!

554
00:51:24.875 --> 00:51:26.000
Ali!

555
00:51:31.541 --> 00:51:34.916
Have you seen a boy
aged eight or nine? His name is Ali.

556
00:51:36.291 --> 00:51:37.125
Say something!

557
00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:43.791
Ali!

558
00:51:49.458 --> 00:51:50.708
-What is it?
-What happened?

559
00:51:50.791 --> 00:51:52.333
-What is it. brother?
-Brother?

560
00:52:00.166 --> 00:52:01.916
Gonzi…

561
00:52:07.666 --> 00:52:08.500
Ali?

562
00:52:15.458 --> 00:52:19.250
Where have you been. Ali?
I spent the morning looking for you.

563
00:52:19.333 --> 00:52:21.208
I saw my mom in my dream.

564
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:26.458
It seemed like she was around here.
She was calling for me.

565
00:52:28.166 --> 00:52:31.666
I went to look for her.
I came back when I couldn't find her.

566
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:41.083
Ali.

567
00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:44.000
this place is not very safe.

568
00:52:44.958 --> 00:52:47.250
Never go out without me again. okay?

569
00:52:48.416 --> 00:52:49.833
You scared me.

570
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.541
Do you know your home address?

571
00:53:19.375 --> 00:53:22.416
But you can show me if we go
to where you got into the sack?

572
00:53:22.916 --> 00:53:23.833
Why?

573
00:53:24.625 --> 00:53:28.125
-To let her know you're okay.
-My stepfather will see me.

574
00:53:28.791 --> 00:53:31.708
He won't. Ali. We'll make a plan.

575
00:53:33.291 --> 00:53:34.708
You show me your home.

576
00:53:34.791 --> 00:53:38.416
and I'll talk to your mom
when your stepfather goes away. Okay?

577
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:42.208
No. Mom told me to never come back.

578
00:53:44.125 --> 00:53:46.958
She was scared. Ali.
What else could she say?

579
00:53:47.833 --> 00:53:53.041
I don't want her to be even more scared.
Don't get me wrong. I won't send you away.

580
00:53:53.791 --> 00:53:57.000
I want her to know you are alive and well.

581
00:54:00.083 --> 00:54:02.208
-Brother?
-What?

582
00:54:05.708 --> 00:54:09.583
-We'll find the money. right?
-For sure. Ali. That's easy.

583
00:54:11.458 --> 00:54:12.458
Look.

584
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:14.916
Let's make a deal.

585
00:54:16.125 --> 00:54:20.250
You show me your home.
and I find you the money. okay?

586
00:54:29.416 --> 00:54:30.500
Give me your hand.

587
00:54:33.791 --> 00:54:36.208
-Deal?
-Deal.

588
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.750
Shall we go to the sea?

589
00:54:40.416 --> 00:54:41.250
Alright.

590
00:54:53.083 --> 00:54:54.416
Come here!

591
00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:58.666
-I won't drown. right?
-Come here. I'll hold you.

592
00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:00.708
Don't step on anything sharp.

593
00:55:00.791 --> 00:55:03.791
-So cold!
-You'll warm up once you're in it.

594
00:55:05.833 --> 00:55:07.416
Come here. Come on!

595
00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:12.958
Keep holding me.

596
00:55:18.833 --> 00:55:19.875
Lie face down.

597
00:55:23.291 --> 00:55:24.750
-Go on!
-I'm swimming!

598
00:55:30.291 --> 00:55:32.583
Gonzi! Come over here!

599
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:36.500
I'm swimming!

600
00:55:46.583 --> 00:55:47.750
Good job.

601
00:55:48.916 --> 00:55:49.750
Well done.

602
00:56:12.375 --> 00:56:15.125
So. you learned how to swim today.

603
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:17.666
Your mom will be surprised.

604
00:56:18.833 --> 00:56:20.958
She'll say. "Good for you. my boy."

605
00:56:21.625 --> 00:56:24.041
Okay. Have a good night.

606
00:56:25.541 --> 00:56:26.375
Brother Mehmet?

607
00:56:28.833 --> 00:56:30.208
Thank you.

608
00:56:31.791 --> 00:56:32.916
You're welcome. Ali.

609
00:56:57.333 --> 00:56:59.208
Have you made tea. Mehmet?

610
00:57:01.833 --> 00:57:05.916
He swore he wouldn't tell you.
He told on me right away. didn't he?

611
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.791
Don't be mad at Gonzales.
Tell me what you'll fucking do.

612
00:57:12.708 --> 00:57:14.125
I don't know.

613
00:57:14.208 --> 00:57:17.083
He came out of nowhere.
I couldn't kick him out.

614
00:57:18.125 --> 00:57:22.791
His parents must be worried.
Have you tried to reach out to them?

615
00:57:24.583 --> 00:57:25.958
I talked to the boy.

616
00:57:27.208 --> 00:57:30.208
He'll take me to his home.
and I'll talk to his mom.

617
00:57:32.458 --> 00:57:33.625
And tell her what?

618
00:57:35.625 --> 00:57:40.000
"He is fine. Don't worry.
I'll bring him to you whenever you want."

619
00:57:40.083 --> 00:57:44.708
What if his mom threw him out willingly?

620
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000
-What if she doesn't want him back?
-No. Uncle.

621
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.708
She did it to save him
from his stepfather.

622
00:57:53.916 --> 00:57:55.625
How do you know?

623
00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.583
I saw it.

624
00:58:00.833 --> 00:58:02.125
He's covered in bruises.

625
00:58:02.208 --> 00:58:05.708
What the fuck was his mom doing
while he was getting beaten?

626
00:58:06.291 --> 00:58:08.750
The poor woman must have had no choice.

627
00:58:09.541 --> 00:58:13.583
That son of a bitch beat them so bad
that she got scared probably.

628
00:58:13.666 --> 00:58:17.958
-To save the kid. she--
-She put him in the cart. Is that so?

629
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:20.541
-Exactly.
-Let's assume it's true.

630
00:58:20.625 --> 00:58:25.416
Wouldn't his mom look
all over Istanbul to find him?

631
00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:28.541
Maybe she is trying to find him now.

632
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:31.583
She'll be happy when I take him back.

633
00:58:31.666 --> 00:58:34.333
What if she says.

634
00:58:34.416 --> 00:58:38.458
"I threw this kid out willingly.
I don't want him back"?

635
00:58:39.333 --> 00:58:43.416
-What then?
-It's not possible. Uncle Tahsin.

636
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:46.583
Please. what kind
of a mother would do that?

637
00:58:48.666 --> 00:58:52.458
All mothers love. protect.

638
00:58:52.541 --> 00:58:57.083
and dote on their children. Is that so?

639
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:59.208
Isn't that so?

640
00:59:00.333 --> 00:59:02.458
So. tell me. Mehmet.

641
00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.958
Where are the mothers of all these kids?

642
00:59:07.416 --> 00:59:09.541
Where is Gonzales' mother?

643
00:59:10.333 --> 00:59:14.000
Where is Flea's mother?
Where is Arab's mother?

644
00:59:15.166 --> 00:59:17.625
Why are these kids
out on the street. Mehmet?

645
00:59:21.916 --> 00:59:23.208
I see. Uncle.

646
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:33.208
I'll take care of this kid. then.

647
00:59:35.166 --> 00:59:37.000
Like you take care of us.

648
00:59:37.708 --> 00:59:40.791
You are sick. my boy. You are sick.

649
00:59:45.708 --> 00:59:46.625
Uncle Tahsin!

650
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:53.250
Ali!

651
00:59:57.083 --> 00:59:58.083
Ali!

652
01:00:02.458 --> 01:00:05.041
What are you laughing at? Huh?

653
01:00:05.125 --> 01:00:06.208
Fuck off.

654
01:00:06.291 --> 01:00:07.166
Ali!

655
01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:11.500
-What?
-Come here. I have a gift for you.

656
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Hurry!

657
01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:16.791
Don't laugh. okay?

658
01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:21.583
Come on over.

659
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:26.750
There you go!

660
01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:32.583
You asked me to find you work. so I did.

661
01:00:33.791 --> 01:00:35.000
What is it?

662
01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:37.500
This…

663
01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:42.625
-Is this mine?
-Of course!

664
01:00:46.541 --> 01:00:49.666
I made it for you myself.
Give me your hand.

665
01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:54.000
We'll go to work together now. Ali.
I'll teach you everything.

666
01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.208
-Okay?
-Okay.

667
01:00:55.291 --> 01:00:57.625
What to collect. where to look…

668
01:00:58.541 --> 01:00:59.375
Grab it.

669
01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:04.333
Okay. now…

670
01:01:05.541 --> 01:01:10.166
Let's see. You put your hand here.
Put the other one like that too.

671
01:01:11.208 --> 01:01:13.833
-Good job. Are you ready?
-Yes!

672
01:01:14.666 --> 01:01:15.500
Let's race!

673
01:01:16.875 --> 01:01:17.791
Come on.

674
01:01:22.708 --> 01:01:23.583
Go back.

675
01:01:24.375 --> 01:01:25.416
Alright.

676
01:01:27.625 --> 01:01:32.000
On my count. Three. two. one.

677
01:01:32.666 --> 01:01:33.541
Go!

678
01:01:54.416 --> 01:01:55.958
Crush it really well.

679
01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:59.708
They take up a lot of space.
You need to crush them.

680
01:02:03.875 --> 01:02:08.791
Put them against the sides of the sack
so that it stands like a box. Like that.

681
01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:10.541
Jump!

682
01:02:11.083 --> 01:02:11.958
Let's go.

683
01:02:18.666 --> 01:02:22.750
Open the cap and squeeze really well
to take out all the air.

684
01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:29.125
Come here.

685
01:02:29.916 --> 01:02:31.250
What about this one?

686
01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:43.375
Ali. look.

687
01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:47.416
Make sure to take these bottles.
They sell for five liras.

688
01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.208
-There are loads here on the weekends.
-Okay.

689
01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:15.416
You were hungry. right?

690
01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.500
We started from
that bridge in the morning.

691
01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:22.333
Went around.
climbed up there. and came down here.

692
01:04:09.291 --> 01:04:10.375
Take this.

693
01:04:11.541 --> 01:04:12.750
It's so cool!

694
01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:17.458
I played with it as a kid.

695
01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:20.291
You can have it.

696
01:04:21.916 --> 01:04:24.000
-Are you tired?
-Yes.

697
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:27.250
If you're awake when I'm back.
we'll have a race.

698
01:04:28.416 --> 01:04:31.583
If you're asleep.
I'll see you in the morning. Okay?

699
01:04:31.666 --> 01:04:32.583
Okay.

700
01:04:44.583 --> 01:04:47.083
Brother Mehmet. where is Ali?

701
01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:49.916
-Where is he?
-Where is Ali?

702
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.208
Are you high again?

703
01:04:53.541 --> 01:04:56.125
-Why are you laughing?
-Where is Ali?

704
01:04:56.208 --> 01:05:00.041
"Where is Ali?" Why do you care?
He is sleeping at home.

705
01:05:00.791 --> 01:05:01.833
Be nice.

706
01:05:02.333 --> 01:05:04.541
-Just asking.
-Piss off!

707
01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:48.041
Where is it?

708
01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:20.375
Hey!

709
01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:22.416
What are you doing?

710
01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:24.958
Ali!

711
01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:26.833
Ali!

712
01:06:28.041 --> 01:06:29.083
Ali!

713
01:06:29.875 --> 01:06:31.791
Ali!

714
01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:35.916
Have you sniffed glue?

715
01:06:41.791 --> 01:06:43.666
Ali!

716
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.625
My phone…

717
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.666
Gonzi…

718
01:06:52.416 --> 01:06:56.375
Hello? Gonzi. come to my place right away!

719
01:06:57.666 --> 01:06:59.375
Ali!

720
01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:01.375
Open your eyes. Ali. Ali!

721
01:07:01.458 --> 01:07:03.458
Can you hear me? Ali!

722
01:07:06.166 --> 01:07:09.958
Ali! Why did you do it?

723
01:07:10.666 --> 01:07:11.500
Ali!

724
01:07:12.375 --> 01:07:16.291
Ali? Talk to me. Ali!

725
01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:19.416
They said I'd see my mom if I sniffed it.

726
01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:22.500
That's why.

727
01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:23.791
Ali…

728
01:07:29.708 --> 01:07:32.416
Never do it again. okay?

729
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.708
Never do it again. Ali.

730
01:07:35.791 --> 01:07:37.666
Why did you hit me?

731
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:42.166
I didn't. Ali.
I slapped you lightly to wake you up.

732
01:07:43.916 --> 01:07:46.208
Why don't you leave Mom alone?

733
01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:47.958
Ali?

734
01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:51.666
It's me. Mehmet.

735
01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:55.541
Are you going to give me my mom back?

736
01:07:57.250 --> 01:07:59.416
Ali. I'm Mehmet.

737
01:08:04.875 --> 01:08:10.041
-Why did you hit me? What did I do to you?
-I'm Mehmet. Ali. Please don't.

738
01:08:10.125 --> 01:08:15.166
I just slapped you lightly to wake you up.
I'm not your stepfather. I'm Mehmet.

739
01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:18.666
-Let me go!
-Come here. Stop it. Ali!

740
01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:23.666
-Let me go! Now!
-Stop it. Ali! You're breaking my heart!

741
01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:26.958
-You're hurting me. Ali. Stop!
-Let me go!

742
01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:20.750
Mom?

743
01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:30.458
I'll be a good boy from now on.

744
01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:33.708
I promise.

745
01:09:39.666 --> 01:09:42.416
Ali. that's my photo.

746
01:09:43.583 --> 01:09:44.791
Give it to me.

747
01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:47.208
I miss you so much. Mom.

748
01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:51.791
That's me. Ali. That's my photo.
It's my mom there.

749
01:09:52.916 --> 01:09:55.166
Ali. Give it to me.

750
01:09:55.916 --> 01:09:58.583
Give my photo back. Ali. Come on.

751
01:10:00.833 --> 01:10:02.625
Why would you be in this photo?

752
01:10:05.208 --> 01:10:06.125
That's me. Ali.

753
01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:11.208
That's my photo. It's not you. It's me!

754
01:10:14.833 --> 01:10:19.208
-You're my stepfather.
-I'm not. Ali! That's my photo!

755
01:10:19.708 --> 01:10:23.666
Give it to me. Ali!

756
01:10:24.416 --> 01:10:26.333
Give it to me! Don't do it!

757
01:10:26.416 --> 01:10:29.750
Don't rip it up. Ali!
Please. don't do it. Ali!

758
01:10:29.833 --> 01:10:33.166
What have you done. Ali? Don't…

759
01:10:34.083 --> 01:10:35.625
What have you done. Ali?

760
01:10:36.583 --> 01:10:40.708
Ali! What have you done?

761
01:10:44.208 --> 01:10:45.333
Ali…

762
01:11:01.916 --> 01:11:03.083
What happened. brother?

763
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.125
They got Ali to sniff glue.

764
01:11:21.916 --> 01:11:23.791
I wanted to take him to the hospital.

765
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.291
He's fine now. Sleeping.
He has calmed down.

766
01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:32.208
What's up with the photo?

767
01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:40.083
He thought I was his stepfather
and ripped it up.

768
01:11:46.833 --> 01:11:51.291
Come here. brother.
Come on. It's over now. okay?

769
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.708
Come on.

770
01:11:54.583 --> 01:11:55.541
It's okay.

771
01:11:56.166 --> 01:11:59.625
We can't take him to the hospital
for sniffing glue anyway.

772
01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:14.458
They got him to sniff glue
by saying he'd see his mom.

773
01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:18.666
So he did it.

774
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.333
He misses his mom so much
that he sniffed glue.

775
01:12:32.458 --> 01:12:34.625
Those bastards got me to do it too.

776
01:12:36.416 --> 01:12:38.583
Back when I first became homeless.

777
01:12:40.041 --> 01:12:41.291
They fooled me too.

778
01:12:52.791 --> 01:12:56.500
It's okay now. brother.
Why don't you lie down?

779
01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:01.958
We've all been there.
Don't worry about him. just rest.

780
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:03.875
Okay? Come on now.

781
01:13:04.916 --> 01:13:05.833
Gonzi.

782
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:12.083
What happened to this boy breaks my heart.

783
01:13:14.125 --> 01:13:15.583
I'll take him home tomorrow.

784
01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:20.166
Where are we going?

785
01:13:21.833 --> 01:13:25.166
We'll collect some paper there
and then go to Cihangir.

786
01:13:25.791 --> 01:13:27.416
Let's not go there.

787
01:13:28.208 --> 01:13:30.500
You promised to show me your home.

788
01:13:31.041 --> 01:13:34.083
-But I don't know where it is.
-You'll remember when you see it.

789
01:13:38.458 --> 01:13:41.916
-Do you remember this neighborhood?
-I do.

790
01:13:45.125 --> 01:13:46.458
Is your home nearby?

791
01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:52.833
You told me not to take you
to the police. and I didn't.

792
01:13:52.916 --> 01:13:57.541
You asked for a job. and I got you one.
Now. you need to show me your home.

793
01:13:58.416 --> 01:13:59.791
Yes. Gonzi?

794
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:04.750
We're in Cihangir. looking for Ali's home.

795
01:14:05.583 --> 01:14:07.083
There is a playground here.

796
01:14:08.916 --> 01:14:09.833
I don't know.

797
01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:12.125
Ali?

798
01:14:17.916 --> 01:14:18.791
Ali?

799
01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:47.333
Is this your home?

800
01:15:12.875 --> 01:15:14.000
Do you know him?

801
01:15:15.916 --> 01:15:16.750
Who is he?

802
01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:18.708
My stepfather.

803
01:15:20.666 --> 01:15:21.625
Stay here.

804
01:15:25.666 --> 01:15:26.541
Hey!

805
01:15:53.125 --> 01:15:54.416
Where did you go?

806
01:16:07.583 --> 01:16:08.500
Ali!

807
01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:18.333
Ali? Don't be scared. I'm here.

808
01:16:20.666 --> 01:16:23.291
What happened to your face? Come here.

809
01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:29.333
Who did this to you? Huh?

810
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:33.083
Was it those bastards?

811
01:16:33.666 --> 01:16:35.375
It was my stepfather.

812
01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:36.916
Your stepfather?

813
01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:44.125
It can't be him. Ali. He went away.
Did he come from back there to hit you?

814
01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:45.041
I don't know.

815
01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:47.708
-Tell me the truth.
-I am telling the truth!

816
01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:56.083
These bastards slapped you
because we are in their zone. right?

817
01:16:57.375 --> 01:16:58.541
Wait here.

818
01:17:00.458 --> 01:17:04.000
-Who slapped this kid? Was it you?
-Are you talking to me?

819
01:17:04.083 --> 01:17:05.666
-It's not your turf!
-Yes.

820
01:17:35.625 --> 01:17:37.041
-Police!
-Police!

821
01:18:54.125 --> 01:18:55.041
Get well soon.

822
01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.041
We almost lost you.

823
01:19:02.208 --> 01:19:03.625
You were lucky.

824
01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:14.375
Is your kid okay?

825
01:19:17.875 --> 01:19:18.708
Sorry?

826
01:19:21.875 --> 01:19:22.958
He was sick?

827
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:27.958
Is he okay now?

828
01:19:28.041 --> 01:19:31.583
You're under the influence
of medication. sir. Get some rest.

829
01:19:46.583 --> 01:19:47.916
You…

830
01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:52.416
Who are you?

831
01:19:54.541 --> 01:19:55.666
Sir.

832
01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.375
Some of your blood
is still in the machine.

833
01:20:00.541 --> 01:20:02.791
Lie still. okay?

834
01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:08.583
Get well soon.

835
01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.166
-Gonzi.
-Brother?

836
01:20:31.625 --> 01:20:32.458
Where is Ali?

837
01:20:35.708 --> 01:20:36.541
He's not here.

838
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.291
What do you mean?

839
01:20:39.375 --> 01:20:42.541
I mean… I couldn't find Ali. brother.

840
01:20:46.791 --> 01:20:47.958
You couldn't find him?

841
01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.666
-What the hell are you doing?
-Let me go!

842
01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:07.958
Are you insane? Half of your blood is
still in the machine!

843
01:21:08.041 --> 01:21:11.666
-I need to go now! Let go of me!
-Hey!

844
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:14.791
Let go of me. Gonzi! Let me go!

845
01:21:16.208 --> 01:21:18.625
-Let me go!
-Brother!

846
01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:20.750
Let me go!

847
01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:24.291
-Let me go.
-You'll kill yourself!

848
01:21:24.375 --> 01:21:27.375
Let go of me! Let go of me…

849
01:21:39.125 --> 01:21:41.375
Let go of me…

850
01:21:46.625 --> 01:21:48.166
You'll kill yourself.

851
01:21:54.583 --> 01:21:56.000
Take me out of here.

852
01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:10.166
Did you tell him again?

853
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:12.125
-Please. brother.
-Shut up.

854
01:23:13.791 --> 01:23:17.166
What are you doing. Mehmet?
Why did you take that money?

855
01:23:18.791 --> 01:23:21.916
-I have something to do.
-Enough. Mehmet.

856
01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:25.333
Get out of my way. Uncle Tahsin.

857
01:23:25.416 --> 01:23:29.458
Give me the money.
If you lose it. we can't save it up again.

858
01:23:29.541 --> 01:23:32.750
-Just give it. brother.
-Get back! Let go of me!

859
01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:36.916
I'll stab you all!
I don't care if you are my brothers!

860
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.333
-Get back!
-Give it to us. Mehmet.

861
01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:43.208
-Give it--
-Let me go! Get back. Uncle Tahsin!

862
01:23:43.291 --> 01:23:47.916
-They always trick you. Mehmet.
-Nobody can trick me!

863
01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:54.000
-That's what you want to believe!
-What did I believe. Uncle Tahsin?

864
01:23:57.958 --> 01:24:00.000
You never took me to my mother.

865
01:24:01.333 --> 01:24:02.750
You never tried!

866
01:24:04.375 --> 01:24:06.416
I was treated like a bastard!

867
01:24:09.333 --> 01:24:11.666
That kid won't go through the same stuff.

868
01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:18.083
I made a promise. A promise!

869
01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:24.166
I'll save them both.

870
01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:27.916
I'll save them both.

871
01:24:31.625 --> 01:24:32.458
Let me go.

872
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:34.833
-Brother!
-Let him go.

873
01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:39.708
Let him go.

874
01:24:57.333 --> 01:25:01.875
STRUGGLE ALLEY

875
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:07.875
I need to make money. To save Mom.

876
01:25:07.958 --> 01:25:11.083
You are sick. my boy. You are sick.

877
01:25:11.583 --> 01:25:14.083
I got the money. I'll live.

878
01:25:15.791 --> 01:25:17.583
I'll live for this boy.

879
01:26:07.666 --> 01:26:09.041
I came to get you two.

880
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:11.375
You and Ali.

881
01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:12.708
My dear boy…

882
01:26:12.791 --> 01:26:15.875
Look.

883
01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:20.916
-What's this?
-I got the money. I'll save you.

884
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.041
Is it you again?

885
01:26:22.958 --> 01:26:28.250
I'm sick of you! It's you again!
Don't come back here ever again. Go!

886
01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:32.458
-Get back! Get back now!
-Calm down.

887
01:26:32.958 --> 01:26:34.041
Where is Ali?

888
01:26:34.541 --> 01:26:36.333
Ali isn't here. boy.

889
01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:38.083
Ali!

890
01:26:40.708 --> 01:26:41.916
I'm here. Ali!

891
01:26:44.250 --> 01:26:45.083
Ali!

892
01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:49.208
Ali!

893
01:26:50.833 --> 01:26:52.375
Mehmet Ali. that's enough.

894
01:27:02.416 --> 01:27:03.666
Ali. where are you?

895
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:09.083
Where are you. Ali?

896
01:27:09.583 --> 01:27:12.541
Where did you hide him? Where is he?

897
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Get back.

898
01:27:28.291 --> 01:27:30.000
Did you learn your lesson?

899
01:27:31.375 --> 01:27:32.375
Where are you going?

900
01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:38.083
Where are you going?
Didn't I warn you before?

901
01:27:38.166 --> 01:27:40.416
What did you do? I'll kill you!

902
01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:45.583
I'll kill you and your mom!
You're a pain in the neck! I'll kill you!

903
01:27:48.583 --> 01:27:51.541
We know that you used to live here. boy.

904
01:27:53.916 --> 01:27:58.541
We asked our neighbors about you.
Your heartless parents threw you out.

905
01:28:00.333 --> 01:28:01.458
Didn't I tell you?

906
01:28:04.458 --> 01:28:08.125
Mehmet Ali! Enough! Let go of my son!

907
01:28:08.208 --> 01:28:12.041
My boy… Come here. my boy.

908
01:28:14.083 --> 01:28:16.833
Your family left this place. son.

909
01:28:18.958 --> 01:28:23.458
I know you have suffered.
but you have to accept the reality.

910
01:28:23.541 --> 01:28:25.708
You don't have a family.

911
01:28:29.083 --> 01:28:30.666
Give us some peace.

912
01:28:31.541 --> 01:28:32.500
Goodbye. baby.

913
01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:35.291
Mom!

914
01:28:48.375 --> 01:28:50.208
Goodbye. baby.

915
01:28:51.291 --> 01:28:52.416
Mom!

916
01:28:54.666 --> 01:28:57.250
Enough!

917
01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:02.041
Enough!

918
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.791
Enough…

919
01:29:16.916 --> 01:29:18.750
Mehmet Ali was like a brother to me.

920
01:29:22.583 --> 01:29:24.000
We grew up together.

921
01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:26.541
STRUGGLE ALLEY

922
01:29:30.333 --> 01:29:33.833
We tried to build our lives
with what other people threw away.

923
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:46.250
Mehmet Ali was different.

924
01:29:48.333 --> 01:29:50.208
He'd lose his sanity sometimes.

925
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:54.291
Ali! Ali?

926
01:29:54.375 --> 01:29:57.875
Later on. he wasn't able
to tell imagination from reality.

927
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:03.500
I played with it as a kid.

928
01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:05.708
You can have it.

929
01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:07.083
Ali!

930
01:30:07.166 --> 01:30:09.500
His childhood kept calling him back.

931
01:30:09.583 --> 01:30:12.250
Come here. I have a gift for you. Hurry!

932
01:30:12.333 --> 01:30:15.541
He did everything
to make his childhood happy.

933
01:30:17.166 --> 01:30:18.875
Guys. hey!

934
01:30:19.791 --> 01:30:21.666
Let's blow together. Ali.

935
01:30:23.125 --> 01:30:24.208
Let's go.

936
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.583
We watched how he took care of him.

937
01:30:32.958 --> 01:30:34.333
We didn't say anything.

938
01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:36.750
You look so handsome.

939
01:30:37.375 --> 01:30:38.291
We couldn't.

940
01:30:38.375 --> 01:30:41.958
Hey. Gonzi! Okay. enough!

941
01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:44.666
If you like water. we can go to the sea.

942
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:47.166
He'd look happier than he ever looked.

943
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.458
Where were you today?

944
01:30:54.708 --> 01:30:58.666
This kid came out of your sack.
What am I going to do with him now?

945
01:31:00.791 --> 01:31:02.833
Uncle. Ali is back.

946
01:31:02.916 --> 01:31:06.250
That's my photo! Give it to me. Ali!

947
01:31:06.333 --> 01:31:09.500
No. give it back. No. Ali!

948
01:31:09.583 --> 01:31:11.958
Don't! What have you done. Ali?

949
01:31:12.541 --> 01:31:14.208
Ali!

950
01:31:33.541 --> 01:31:36.916
APARTMENT FOR SALE

951
01:31:49.833 --> 01:31:55.208
All he wanted was to help unite
his abandoned childhood and his mom.

952
01:32:07.833 --> 01:32:09.166
Mom…

953
01:32:22.041 --> 01:32:23.916
Mehmet Ali was a street kid.

954
01:32:27.416 --> 01:32:29.375
He didn't have a mother to tuck him in.

955
01:32:31.291 --> 01:32:32.500
He was all alone.

956
01:32:35.833 --> 01:32:36.875
Like us.
