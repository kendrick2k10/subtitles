[sighs]
Millie doesn't even seem
affected

350
00:17:29.382 --> 00:17:31.632
and she and Clea
were really good friends.

351
00:17:31.718 --> 00:17:35.011
Honey. you never know what
happens behind closed doors.

352
00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:36.504
I mean. people grieve
in their own way.

353
00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.222
It just seems weird.

354
00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:39.515
Clea got a great score

355
00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:41.893
and she was devastated by it
somehow.

356
00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:43.352
Then she dies?

357
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.021
And then I just found out
that 11 people

358
00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:48.182
scored over 1400.
including Sebastian.

359
00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.776
- So?
- I saw his practice test.

360
00:17:49.861 --> 00:17:51.319
He barely cracked a 1000.

361
00:17:51.404 --> 00:17:53.863
How did he suddenly jump
400 points?

362
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.523
I think you need to be happy
for everyone--

363
00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.283
It's just that I've wanted
to go to Bentonville since I was

364
00:17:57.368 --> 00:17:59.202
like. ten. mom.
and it feels like

365
00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:00.828
these other kids
just jumped the line somehow.

366
00:18:00.914 --> 00:18:04.207
We come from different worlds.
okay?

367
00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:06.375
And I like our world.

368
00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:09.670
It's late nights and hard work
and messy sometimes

369
00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:13.040
but it's real and it's ours.

370
00:18:13.134 --> 00:18:16.094
And no matter
what those other kids do

371
00:18:16.179 --> 00:18:19.222
you will always be my all-star.

Gotta say.
it seems totally worth it now.

386
00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:02.265

on this list
were in our test group?

Actually. I want you to find out
which of the kids on this list

if it's that effective.

that I find unforgivable.

But I knew she was somehow
taking the class

503
00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:54.200
because she was so secretive.

504
00:24:54.285 --> 00:24:57.945
Was the class an SAT prep?

505
00:24:58.039 --> 00:25:00.614

was gone until a week ago

that's after she'd taken
the course and her SATs.

507

by telling me that

she didn't even seem proud.

'This is Jax. Leave a message.'

522
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:52.833
Hey. it's me again.
I have a flat.

523
00:25:52.927 --> 00:25:55.836
I'm headed home.
But if you get this. pick me up.

524
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.972
I'm headed up Chester Avenue.

525
00:25:58.057 --> 00:26:01.058

Help me! Help me! Help!

531
00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:26.250
Stop! Help! No!

532
00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:27.376

[dramatic music]

534
00:26:39.015 --> 00:26:40.681
We have to go to the police.
Kaley.

535
00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:45.102
And say what? It was dark.
and I can't identify anything.

536
00:26:45.187 --> 00:26:48.314
- They just wanted this laptop.
- Then we have to tell your mom.

537
00:26:48.399 --> 00:26:49.565
She's gonna notice
the spare tire.

538
00:26:49.692 --> 00:26:50.899
No. Please. Jax. Come on.

539
00:26:51.027 --> 00:26:53.319
She's just gonna lose her mind
for no reason.

540
00:26:53.404 --> 00:26:58.073
Just tell her that I hit a nail.
or something.

541
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.533
I think it was Millie.

542
00:26:59.619 --> 00:27:02.402
She saw me
looking at Clea's laptop.

543
00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:04.079
She must have hung out.
and when she saw me

544
00:27:04.206 --> 00:27:05.289
leaving with it. she freaked.

545
00:27:05.374 --> 00:27:08.709
Okay.
so she left Mrs. Braverman's

546
00:27:08.794 --> 00:27:11.253
changed into all black
and then came back

547
00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.130
just assuming
you had Clea's laptop?

548
00:27:13.215 --> 00:27:14.923
So she put on a jacket
and a hat.

549
00:27:15.051 --> 00:27:16.967
She's been giving me
death stares all week

550
00:27:17.053 --> 00:27:18.552
ever since I confronted her
about her score.

551
00:27:18.638 --> 00:27:20.638
Okay. okay.
that's a heck of a jump. Kay.

552
00:27:20.723 --> 00:27:22.589
Come on. a bunch of kids

553
00:27:22.683 --> 00:27:24.266
who have never
cared about their grades

554
00:27:24.393 --> 00:27:28.095
suddenly get over 1400
on the SAT. including Clea.

555
00:27:28.189 --> 00:27:32.316
Then she has a problem with it.
specifically. with Millie.

556
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:35.653
Okay. so. again.
let's go to the police.

557
00:27:35.738 --> 00:27:39.281
Okay. but first
let's find some evidence.

558
00:27:39.408 --> 00:27:41.283
I think there's something
on here.

559
00:27:42.745 --> 00:27:44.536
Okay. well. this thing is dead.

560
00:27:44.622 --> 00:27:47.790
I'll charge it and take a crack
at it tomorrow. okay?

561
00:27:47.917 --> 00:27:50.292
For now. though.
I did get the names

562
00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:52.419
of the 1400-plus kids
who were in our test group

563
00:27:52.505 --> 00:27:54.121
and signed up
for the same prep course.

564
00:27:54.215 --> 00:27:55.631
I knew you could it.

565
00:27:55.758 --> 00:27:56.965
And for extra credit. the name

566
00:27:57.093 --> 00:27:57.966
of the prep course they were all

567
00:27:58.094 --> 00:28:00.636
signed up for is Gevest Prep.

568
00:28:00.763 --> 00:28:03.931
I couldn't find anything on them
except for a one-page website

569
00:28:04.016 --> 00:28:06.183
that they started this year.

570
00:28:06.268 --> 00:28:08.301
The owner is Nat Gevest

571
00:28:08.396 --> 00:28:11.689
but he or she
is completely invisible online.

572
00:28:11.774 --> 00:28:15.984
No campaigns.
no advertisements. no websites.

573
00:28:16.112 --> 00:28:18.987
I need another day.
I'm only one man.

574
00:28:20.116 --> 00:28:21.648

and the top scorer
from our tests last year.

588
00:28:59.864 --> 00:29:02.030
- They all make sense.
- Exactly.

589
00:29:02.158 --> 00:29:05.868
It's these.. These don't make
any sense at all.

598
00:29:32.313 --> 00:29:33.386
to do with me
is any of your business.

599
00:29:33.481 --> 00:29:34.938
- Millie. can we just--
- Save it.

[gasps]
Mom!

697
00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:43.765
Mom!

698
00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:51.940
So you're not sure if this
person was a male or a female?

699
00:35:52.067 --> 00:35:54.109
Okay. well.
I will add that into the file

700
00:35:54.236 --> 00:35:56.153
along with the text messages
and the threats--

701
00:35:56.238 --> 00:35:57.988
I don't think you'll find
anything. I already asked

702
00:35:58.073 --> 00:35:59.406
my boyfriend.
and he said that it was sent

703
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:01.783
with an encryption app.
it's untraceable.

704
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:03.785
The person in the driveway.
do you think that might have

705
00:36:03.912 --> 00:36:05.111
been the same person
that attacked you?

706
00:36:05.205 --> 00:36:06.955
- Friday night?
- Maybe.

707
00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:08.540
I can't believe
you didn't tell me about that.

708
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:09.875
I know. mom. I'm sorry.

709
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.335
Look. we dusted the car
for prints

710
00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:14.621
we're gonna put that in
the system. but that takes time.

711
00:36:14.715 --> 00:36:17.007
'I would suggest
getting a security system.'

712
00:36:17.092 --> 00:36:18.967
Okay. Thank you.

713
00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:22.012
I know it's been a long night.
I'm sure you want some rest

714
00:36:22.097 --> 00:36:24.055
but look into cameras

715
00:36:24.141 --> 00:36:27.809
as soon as possible.
This feels personal.

716
00:36:27.936 --> 00:36:30.812
And if your daughter's being
targeted. you can never be too--

717
00:36:30.939 --> 00:36:32.314
- Safe.
- Exactly.

718
00:36:32.441 --> 00:36:34.307
Understood.

719
00:36:34.401 --> 00:36:35.859
[sighs]

720
00:36:37.279 --> 00:36:40.697
If you think of anything else

721
00:36:40.782 --> 00:36:43.700
or if you're being harassed
in any way

722
00:36:43.785 --> 00:36:48.321
or if you just want suggestions
on security options. call me.

723
00:36:48.415 --> 00:36:49.831
Thank you.

725
00:36:56.882 --> 00:36:57.830

[sobbing]

727
00:36:59.593 --> 00:37:00.833
Oh. it's okay. baby.

728
00:37:00.928 --> 00:37:03.220
[sobbing]

729
00:37:05.474 --> 00:37:07.015
(Fiona)
It's okay.

00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:10.185
[schoolbell ringing]

731
00:37:14.524 --> 00:37:16.358
(Wells)
Kaley.

732
00:37:16.485 --> 00:37:18.568
I'm gonna need you
to come with me. please.

733
00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:24.115
- And bring your things.
- Ooh!

734
00:37:24.201 --> 00:37:27.202
[dramatic music]

735
00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:39.205
Uh. I'm not sure--

736
00:37:39.299 --> 00:37:41.800
Kaley. I suggest
you don't say another word

737
00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:44.386
until we get to the bottom
of this.

738
00:37:44.513 --> 00:37:45.637
Understood?

739
00:37:49.017 --> 00:37:50.558
Okay.

740
00:37:50.686 --> 00:37:52.102
Please open your locker.

741
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.646
Get back to class.

742
00:37:55.816 --> 00:37:57.565
Step away. please.

743
00:38:01.405 --> 00:38:03.229
Kaley.

744
00:38:03.323 --> 00:38:04.406
Is everything okay?

745
00:38:04.533 --> 00:38:06.616
Ms. Molina..

746
00:38:06.702 --> 00:38:08.243
Get back to homeroom.

747
00:38:10.205 --> 00:38:12.163
Now. please. Ms. Molina.

748
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:17.544
Anything?

749
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.297
Okay.

750
00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:22.507
Good.

751
00:38:22.592 --> 00:38:25.093
Can you please tell me
what this is about?

752
00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.846
I received a tip that
there were drugs in your locker.

753
00:38:27.931 --> 00:38:30.056
You understand we must take
allegations like this

754
00:38:30.142 --> 00:38:31.224
very seriously.

755
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.643
I understand.
but I would never--

756
00:38:33.729 --> 00:38:36.396
I know.
but we had to follow through.

757
00:38:36.481 --> 00:38:39.274
- Can I go back to class now?
- Of course.

758
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:40.567
I'm sorry to have..

759
00:38:46.616 --> 00:38:48.158
- 'You got to be kidding me.'
- 'No. normally I--'

760
00:38:48.243 --> 00:38:49.942
Kaley is a great kid.

761
00:38:50.037 --> 00:38:51.703
We both know
she would never steal a test.

762
00:38:51.788 --> 00:38:54.331
Unfortunately.
the evidence proves otherwise.

763
00:38:54.416 --> 00:38:56.115
Clearly. it was planted.

764
00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:58.835
She's a whiz at chemistry.
It doesn't even make sense.

765
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.880
All my work shows
how I proved everything.

766
00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:03.465
That answer key
doesn't even show work.

767
00:39:03.592 --> 00:39:06.634
I agree. it doesn't.
but there are consequences.

768
00:39:06.762 --> 00:39:08.720
Just tell me what I need to do
to clear my daughter's name

769
00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:11.014
because you know her
and you know her work.

770
00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:13.475
First. you need to tell me
how you got a--

771
00:39:13.602 --> 00:39:16.302
I didn't.
I wouldn't even begin to know

772
00:39:16.396 --> 00:39:18.313
where or how I would even
get the answer key.

773
00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.149
Seriously.
she's just not that type of kid.

774
00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:22.901
She doesn't even need to cheat.

775
00:39:22.986 --> 00:39:25.070
Normally I wouldn't have
considered it

776
00:39:25.155 --> 00:39:27.489
but it's been
a very chaotic time.

777
00:39:27.616 --> 00:39:30.992
Now. I know Clea's death has
affected you. with good reason.

778
00:39:31.119 --> 00:39:36.289
Kaley. you seemed really upset
about the high SAT scores.

779
00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:38.157
Maybe you thought
by having the AP test

780
00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:39.826
it would give you a leg up.

781
00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.587
Maybe the pressure caused you
to make some bad choi--

782
00:39:42.672 --> 00:39:45.331
Principal Wells.
I don't know what's going on

783
00:39:45.425 --> 00:39:49.177
but I swear.
I did not steal the test.

784
00:39:49.304 --> 00:39:51.930
It does seem out of character.

785
00:39:52.015 --> 00:39:54.391
Does anyone else know
your locker combination?

786
00:39:54.476 --> 00:39:57.685
They don't need to.
It's been broken since January.

787
00:39:57.813 --> 00:40:00.230
I asked Mr. Cleary
if he would replace it..

788
00:40:00.315 --> 00:40:03.775
Look. Kaley.
this is your first infraction.

789
00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:05.568
And the tip was about drugs.

790
00:40:05.654 --> 00:40:09.531
So finding the test there
does feel a little like--

791
00:40:09.658 --> 00:40:11.324
Like it was planted?

792
00:40:14.454 --> 00:40:16.204
You're free to go.

793
00:40:16.331 --> 00:40:17.914
Thank you.

794
00:40:26.675 --> 00:40:28.708
(Monica)
'You're good. babe. There
will be new drama in a week.'

795
00:40:28.802 --> 00:40:31.052
Literally everyone
will forget about this.

796
00:40:31.179 --> 00:40:33.346
- Okay.
- Also. you killed it.

797
00:40:33.432 --> 00:40:35.214
So don't get in your head.

798
00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:36.433
(Jackson)
'Kaley.'

799
00:40:37.686 --> 00:40:39.060
- I love you.
- Love you.

800
00:40:39.187 --> 00:40:40.520
- See you tomorrow. Mon.
- 'Bye.'

801
00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:42.772
- Bye.
- Hey. How was volleyball?

802
00:40:42.858 --> 00:40:44.482
It was weird.

803
00:40:44.568 --> 00:40:47.226
It's hard to practice when
your whole team is ignoring you.

804
00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.070
Oh. also there is a rumor
going around

805
00:40:49.197 --> 00:40:51.239
that I cheated
on the AP chem test.

806
00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:52.824
(Jackson)
Listen. anyone who believes that

807
00:40:52.909 --> 00:40:54.784
obviously doesn't know you
at all.

808
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.620
I guess. but still.
I'd rather a rumor going around

809
00:40:57.706 --> 00:41:01.124
about my vicious spike
or my eidetic memory.

810
00:41:02.878 --> 00:41:05.420
You can read minds?

811
00:41:05.547 --> 00:41:07.338
I'm kidding.

812
00:41:07.424 --> 00:41:11.759
I know you have a photographic
memory. I love my smarty-pants.

813
00:41:11.887 --> 00:41:14.637
Sebastian! Stop!

814
00:41:15.432 --> 00:41:16.681
Whoa! Whoa! Okay!

815
00:41:16.766 --> 00:41:18.266
- Jax.
- Yeah. What now?

816
00:41:18.393 --> 00:41:21.394
- That's what I thought.
- A tire iron. I..

817
00:41:23.231 --> 00:41:25.273
It's just like the person
in my driveway.

818
00:41:27.861 --> 00:41:29.527
- 'Are you alright?'
- I'm fine.

819
00:41:29.613 --> 00:41:31.404
Well. you weren't the one
that was attacked.

820
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.823
- Okay? It was really scary.
- Come on. It's okay.

821
00:41:33.909 --> 00:41:35.658
- Come on.
- Jax..

822
00:41:35.744 --> 00:41:36.910
Yeah.

823
00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:41.581
It's creepy. right?

824
00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:43.291
I mean. she was standing
the exact same way.

825
00:41:43.418 --> 00:41:45.793
Okay. slow down. Creepy? Yeah.

826
00:41:45.921 --> 00:41:49.464
But. Kay. everyone
has a tire iron in their trunk.

827
00:41:49.591 --> 00:41:51.299
And. come on.
why would Millie do that?

828
00:41:51.426 --> 00:41:53.384
Power. if she figured out
a way to cheat

829
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:55.637
and shared it with the others.
they would owe her. right?

830
00:41:57.474 --> 00:42:00.475
[chuckles]
That's okay.

831
00:42:00.602 --> 00:42:03.436
That's a lot to risk.
Why not just cheat on your own?

832
00:42:04.606 --> 00:42:05.855
I have no idea.

833
00:42:07.734 --> 00:42:09.192
- What?
- The proctor.

834
00:42:09.277 --> 00:42:10.985
From the SATs.
maybe he saw something.

835
00:42:11.112 --> 00:42:12.820
- Okay. how do we find him?
- He's a librarian.

836
00:42:12.948 --> 00:42:16.449
There are six libraries
in the general vicinity.

837
00:42:16.535 --> 00:42:19.035
How do you know that?
You're such a nerd.

838
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.495
(Olivia)
Volleyball ghost party?

839
00:42:20.622 --> 00:42:22.163
[laughing]

840
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:23.456
[indistinct chatter]

841
00:42:23.542 --> 00:42:24.958
...doing this. Volleyball.

842
00:42:25.043 --> 00:42:28.044
[intense music]

843
00:42:31.132 --> 00:42:32.340
(Jackson)
'Okay. what are we looking for?'

844
00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:33.499
(Kaley)
'Let's just start with the'

845
00:42:33.593 --> 00:42:34.842
'closest library.'

846
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:36.168
- 'Thumbs up with the proctor.'
- 'I don't know.'

847
00:42:36.263 --> 00:42:37.220
(Kaley)
'I mean. I guess maybe'

848
00:42:37.305 --> 00:42:38.221
I'm reaching for straws'

849
00:42:38.306 --> 00:42:39.681
'but I just wanna talk to him.'

850
00:42:39.808 --> 00:42:41.173
(Jackson)
'Don't worry. we'll find him.'

851
00:42:41.268 --> 00:42:44.269
[music continues]

852
00:43:01.746 --> 00:43:02.829
Finally.

853
00:43:04.207 --> 00:43:05.164
- Excuse me?
- Sorry.

854
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.125
This is our third library.

855
00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:09.043
Okay. And can I help you?

856
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.203
You probably don't remember me.
but I left my phone

857
00:43:11.298 --> 00:43:13.131
when I took the SAT.
I was the last one out.

858
00:43:13.216 --> 00:43:14.716
- 'Kaley Parker.'
- Sure.

859
00:43:14.843 --> 00:43:17.844
Anyways. I know this might sound
random. but do you remember

860
00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:20.638
noticing anything weird
during the test?

861
00:43:20.724 --> 00:43:22.381
Weird?

862
00:43:22.475 --> 00:43:24.434
I know that there is at least
two kids from our school

863
00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:26.719
that received scores
that jumped a lot

864
00:43:26.813 --> 00:43:29.897
'from the last time
they took it.'

865
00:43:30.025 --> 00:43:32.058
Like. hundreds of points.

866
00:43:32.152 --> 00:43:35.737
Also. there were an unusual
amount of scores over 1400

867
00:43:35.864 --> 00:43:37.030
all from our school.

868
00:43:37.115 --> 00:43:39.324
So what are you asking me?

869
00:43:39.409 --> 00:43:42.744
Well. I guess
if you noticed anything strange

870
00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:45.038
or suspicious. I'm sure that--

871
00:43:45.123 --> 00:43:46.998
Look. I-I'd like to help.
but I really have no idea

872
00:43:47.083 --> 00:43:48.916
what you're talking about.
also. if you are implying

873
00:43:49.044 --> 00:43:51.794
what I think you're implying.
it's insulting.

874
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.421
- 'But I think--'
- 'Kay. Just come on.'

875
00:43:53.548 --> 00:43:56.257
Ah. sorry to bother you.

876
00:43:56.384 --> 00:44:00.086
What about Gevest Prep?
Or Nat Gevest?

877
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.971
You ever heard
of either of those?

878
00:44:03.266 --> 00:44:04.307
No.

879
00:44:10.106 --> 00:44:13.024
Now. if you don't mind.
I have an actual job to do.

880
00:44:14.903 --> 00:44:16.903
Come on. Come on.

881
00:44:17.906 --> 00:44:19.030
He's hiding something.

882
00:44:19.115 --> 00:44:22.116
[music continues]

883
00:44:27.791 --> 00:44:29.415
[cell phone keys clacking]

884
00:44:31.753 --> 00:44:34.629
[sighs]
We have a problem.

885
00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:41.844
That should do it.

886
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:45.181
Hey. mom. Hey. detective.

887
00:44:45.266 --> 00:44:47.308
Hey. uh.
Carl was just helping me

888
00:44:47.435 --> 00:44:48.726
install our new security system.

889
00:44:48.812 --> 00:44:50.645
- Carl?
- I should probably go.

890
00:44:50.772 --> 00:44:52.188
Thank you. that was literally

891
00:44:52.273 --> 00:44:54.315
above and beyond
the call of duty. and I--

892
00:44:54.442 --> 00:44:56.475
No problem at all.
I installed my sister's system

893
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:59.362
and then I did my own.
I'm getting pretty good at it.

894
00:44:59.447 --> 00:45:01.864
You are.
You should start charging.

895
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:05.868
That's right. I did. I forgot
to. uh. I forgot to invoice you.

896
00:45:05.954 --> 00:45:08.996
- Gotcha.
- Mom. when's your day off?

897
00:45:09.124 --> 00:45:11.332
Oh. um. uh. Tuesday. Why?

898
00:45:11.459 --> 00:45:13.668
Detective Baxter.
my mom is free Tuesday night.

899
00:45:13.795 --> 00:45:15.420
'Just in case you're wondering.'

900
00:45:16.464 --> 00:45:19.498
Okay. I will call you.

901
00:45:19.592 --> 00:45:22.427
Okay. Bye.

902
00:45:25.807 --> 00:45:27.348
- What was that about?
- Oh.

903
00:45:27.475 --> 00:45:30.059
I was overwhelmed
with how to secure this fortress

904
00:45:30.145 --> 00:45:33.062
without going bankrupt.
so I called him for some advice.

905
00:45:33.148 --> 00:45:34.313
Is that what they call it
these days?

906
00:45:34.399 --> 00:45:36.524
[chuckles]
Oh. stop it.

907
00:45:36.651 --> 00:45:40.019
So. bells. whistles
and laser beams?

908
00:45:40.113 --> 00:45:42.238
It's a basic video door cam.

909
00:45:42.323 --> 00:45:44.198
Ah. we can see whoever's
at the front door on our phones.

910
00:45:44.325 --> 00:45:47.452
So no more sneaking Jackson in
late at night? I'm kidding.

911
00:45:47.537 --> 00:45:48.828
But he is coming tonight.
Is that cool?

912
00:45:48.913 --> 00:45:51.873
Yes. honey. that's fine.
I'm gonna be so late.

913
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.041
And I'd rather you not be alone.

914
00:45:54.169 --> 00:45:56.043
- You have homework?
- There's always homework.

915
00:45:56.171 --> 00:45:57.670
[chuckles]
Yes.

916
00:46:00.008 --> 00:46:03.050
(Kaley)
Clearly it has to do with
the prep class they all took.

917
00:46:03.178 --> 00:46:06.387
Clea tried to buy in
and it cost her everything.

918
00:46:06.514 --> 00:46:08.723
What's her favorite color?

919
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:12.894
Purple.
And her favorite number is 33.

920
00:46:13.021 --> 00:46:16.355
I mean. aren't the SATs supposed
to be ironclad against cheating?

921
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:18.274
Also. why wouldn't the proctor
talk to us?

922
00:46:18.359 --> 00:46:20.726
Because he wants
to keep his job.

923
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:23.395
I mean. look.
the guy was definitely intense

924
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:26.407
but you were also kind of
insinuating that he was shady.

925
00:46:28.703 --> 00:46:31.996
He's hiding something.
I know it.

926
00:46:32.081 --> 00:46:35.917
Any other ideas for passwords?
Nothing works with purple.

927
00:46:36.044 --> 00:46:38.461
Scooby-Doo was her favorite show
as a kid.

928
00:46:38.546 --> 00:46:41.339
- So Scooby-Doo?
- No.

929
00:46:41.424 --> 00:46:44.509
[chuckles]
Try "Ruh-ro Raggy".

930
00:46:47.847 --> 00:46:48.805
I'm in!

931
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.349
[chuckling]

932
00:46:51.434 --> 00:46:52.892
Okay. what are we looking for?

933
00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:54.811
I know she used to keep
obsessive notes

934
00:46:54.896 --> 00:46:59.023
so try to find that
or SATs or Gevest Prep

935
00:46:59.108 --> 00:47:00.107
or her mom's emerald ring.

936
00:47:00.235 --> 00:47:02.527
Okay. slow down. One at a time.

937
00:47:03.404 --> 00:47:04.487
Mm..

938
00:47:06.074 --> 00:47:08.449
Well. there's paperwork
from Gevest Prep here.

939
00:47:08.576 --> 00:47:10.535
Clearly. Clea took the course.

940
00:47:11.746 --> 00:47:13.621
Nothing on Nat Gevest.

941
00:47:13.748 --> 00:47:16.374
Oh. there. there!
That's her notes.

942
00:47:18.586 --> 00:47:20.253
"Course isn't what I expected.

943
00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:22.288
"Seems the same
as you can get anywhere

944
00:47:22.382 --> 00:47:24.507
"but four times the cost.

945
00:47:24.592 --> 00:47:26.884
What am I doing here?"

946
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:29.303
Can you go further.
uh. latest entries?

947
00:47:32.934 --> 00:47:34.633
- 'Oh. wow.'
- 'See?'

948
00:47:34.727 --> 00:47:36.769
I told you
that proctor was fishy.

949
00:47:38.523 --> 00:47:40.648
Do me a favor.
uh. go to her photo album.

950
00:47:43.152 --> 00:47:44.485
- That's it!
- What?

951
00:47:44.612 --> 00:47:46.529
Clea's mom's ring.
Millie's wearing it.

952
00:47:46.614 --> 00:47:47.980
That means
that Clea must have used it

953
00:47:48.074 --> 00:47:49.657
to get money
to pay for the course.

954
00:47:49.784 --> 00:47:52.151
So? There's nothing illegal
about that.

955
00:47:52.245 --> 00:47:54.871
Well. Clea wanted it back.
I overheard them arguing.

956
00:47:54.956 --> 00:47:57.373
And she ends up dead?

957
00:47:57.458 --> 00:48:01.210
Okay. you just went from
a stupid decision to murder.

958
00:48:04.424 --> 00:48:05.506
[sighs]

959
00:48:08.261 --> 00:48:12.346
Why did she take so many
pictures of whatever this is?

960
00:48:14.225 --> 00:48:18.060
Weird. I'll run some software
to help see these better.

961
00:48:18.146 --> 00:48:20.229
Gonna go in later.

962
00:48:20.315 --> 00:48:22.231
Well. she listed
her test scores.

963
00:48:22.317 --> 00:48:25.860
None of them were even close
to over 1400.

964
00:48:25.987 --> 00:48:28.195
- It doesn't make sense.
- Hey.

965
00:48:30.158 --> 00:48:33.618
It's okay.
I'm gonna figure it out.

966
00:48:33.703 --> 00:48:34.869
Although.
it might take a minute.

967
00:48:34.996 --> 00:48:37.413
What's a minute in hacker speak?

968
00:48:37.498 --> 00:48:40.249
Mm. probably sometime tomorrow.

969
00:48:40.335 --> 00:48:43.044
I can do some groundwork
tonight.

970
00:48:43.171 --> 00:48:46.088
Alright. well. I'm gonna
pass out. Do you have to go?

971
00:48:46.174 --> 00:48:49.425
No. I'll stay here
till your mom gets home.

972
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:51.802
- Protect you.
- Thanks. Tarzan.

973
00:48:51.888 --> 00:48:53.045
[chuckles]

974
00:48:53.139 --> 00:48:54.764
- Do you mind if I head to bed?
- No.

975
00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:57.058
Go knock out. I'm on duty.

976
00:48:57.185 --> 00:48:59.477
- Thanks. Love you.
- Mm. love you.

977
00:49:03.983 --> 00:49:06.984
[intense music]

978
00:49:14.953 --> 00:49:17.411
(Clea)
I need it back. Millie.
It was my mom's. Please--

979
00:49:17.538 --> 00:49:19.747
(Millie)
No. Clea. we had an agreement.

980
00:49:19.874 --> 00:49:23.125
I have the proof.
It's on my laptop.

981
00:49:23.211 --> 00:49:25.628
I made a huge mistake
and I'm trying to correct it

982
00:49:25.713 --> 00:49:27.755
but I really don't need you
to judge me right now.

983
00:49:27.882 --> 00:49:30.716
[clattering]

984
00:49:30.802 --> 00:49:33.803
[music continues]

985
00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:41.268
Jackson?

986
00:49:48.778 --> 00:49:49.986
Jackson?

987
00:50:05.461 --> 00:50:08.462
[music continues]

988
00:50:16.139 --> 00:50:17.513
Jackson?

989
00:50:36.576 --> 00:50:37.616
[intense music]

990
00:50:37.702 --> 00:50:40.411
[gasps]
Jackson? Jackson?

991
00:50:40.496 --> 00:50:43.164
Jackson? Jackson?

992
00:50:45.418 --> 00:50:46.500
[screams]

993
00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:47.752
No!

994
00:50:53.342 --> 00:50:55.834
[siren blaring]

995
00:50:55.928 --> 00:50:58.179
[beeping]

996
00:50:58.306 --> 00:51:00.014
(Kaley)
'Dr. McKay.
is he gonna be okay?'

997
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:02.308
(McKay)
'We'll take good care of him.
Don't worry.'

998
00:51:08.775 --> 00:51:10.858
That's it. Come on. Come on!

999
00:51:10.985 --> 00:51:13.986
[chuckles]
You got it.
You got it. You got it.

1000
00:51:14.072 --> 00:51:17.356
Yes. that was good!
Really good.

1001
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:19.325
'I mean. I know you can do
better. but that was good.'

1002
00:51:19.410 --> 00:51:21.452
- 'Just gotta be--'
- The best.

1003
00:51:21.537 --> 00:51:23.496
- I know. dad.
- Hey.

1004
00:51:25.166 --> 00:51:27.083
What if
you just can't be the best?

1005
00:51:27.168 --> 00:51:29.752
I mean. there's always gonna be
someone better at everything.

1006
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.422
Honey. honey.
look at me. look at me.

1007
00:51:35.176 --> 00:51:37.218
Money has afforded you
a unique opportunity.

1008
00:51:37.345 --> 00:51:38.928
The world is yours.
you just have to have

1009
00:51:39.013 --> 00:51:40.045
the confidence to own it.

1010
00:51:40.139 --> 00:51:42.214
I know.

1011
00:51:42.308 --> 00:51:43.715
But what if I'm not
strong enough

1012
00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:46.644
or. or smart enough?

1013
00:51:46.729 --> 00:51:50.272
You are. though.
Inside you know that you are.

1014
00:51:50.358 --> 00:51:52.191
You studied. you really applied
yourself in that class

1015
00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:55.402
and look at you. look at you
right now. You're amazing!

1016
00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:57.822
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

1017
00:51:57.907 --> 00:51:59.907
You made the most
of an opportunity

1018
00:52:00.034 --> 00:52:01.567
and you did your best.

1019
00:52:01.661 --> 00:52:05.496
I mean. I'm proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.

1020
00:52:05.581 --> 00:52:07.790
So what are you gonna do?

1021
00:52:07.875 --> 00:52:08.958
- Own it.
- What's that? I'm.. Sorry.

1022
00:52:09.043 --> 00:52:10.292
- What did you say? Yes!
- Own it.

1023
00:52:10.378 --> 00:52:11.919
That's my girl. right there.

1024
00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:14.630
Millie. trust me. if you
just keep charging forward

1025
00:52:14.715 --> 00:52:15.747
there's no stopping you.

1026
00:52:15.842 --> 00:52:17.749
- No stopping me.
- Never.

1027
00:52:17.844 --> 00:52:19.218
- No stopping you. What's that?
- No stopping--

1028
00:52:19.303 --> 00:52:20.261
That's it. That's my girl.

1029
00:52:20.388 --> 00:52:23.639
There you go. Great job today.

1030
00:52:27.228 --> 00:52:30.271
[instrumental music]

1031
00:52:32.108 --> 00:52:33.357
[sighs]

1032
00:52:36.904 --> 00:52:39.530
[sighs]
It's gonna be alright. sweetie.

1033
00:52:39.615 --> 00:52:42.283
I've known Dr. Browne
since med school.

1034
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:44.943
Jackson's in good hands. honey.
He's gonna be okay.

1035
00:52:45.037 --> 00:52:47.746

Mom. I didn't see Clea's laptop.

1038
00:52:56.591 --> 00:52:59.717
Whoever did this must have
taken it and ran out the back.

1039
00:52:59.802 --> 00:53:01.635
Okay. honey.
I'll let Carl know.

1040
00:53:03.097 --> 00:53:06.056
Are you sure you didn't
recognize anything?

1041
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.469
It was dark
and I was just so scared.

1042
00:53:10.563 --> 00:53:13.355
And then I didn't wanna
leave Jackson and--

1043
00:53:13.441 --> 00:53:16.066
Okay. okay. okay. okay. honey.
Okay. honey.

1044
00:53:16.903 --> 00:53:18.235
I got you.

1045
00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:20.312
It's okay. baby.

1046
00:53:20.406 --> 00:53:23.815
Look. look.
work gave me the day off.

1047
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.242
I already called the school.

1048
00:53:25.328 --> 00:53:27.036
How about
we just go crawl into bed?

1049
00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:29.288
- Mm.
- Okay. come on.

1050
00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:31.657
We can worry about
everything else later. okay?

1051
00:53:31.751 --> 00:53:34.752
We could crawl in bed.
you could get comfy..

It was still there this morning.

1059
00:54:18.047 --> 00:54:19.588
Show it to me again.

1060
00:54:22.551 --> 00:54:24.260
They were obviously expecting
the camera.

1061
00:54:24.345 --> 00:54:27.263
Yeah. After I saw this.
I went back and took it off.

1062
00:54:27.348 --> 00:54:28.714
I mean. your camera is not
hidden. so they could have

1063
00:54:28.808 --> 00:54:30.057
seen it on the approach.
but they have

1064
00:54:30.184 --> 00:54:31.225
the duct tape ready like that.

1065
00:54:31.352 --> 00:54:33.227
That's premeditated.

1066
00:54:33.354 --> 00:54:34.520
And I was supposed to run
all the prints

1067
00:54:34.605 --> 00:54:36.063
and the tracks at the lab.

1068
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:38.065
The person was wearing gloves.

1069
00:54:38.192 --> 00:54:40.192
They know exactly
what they're doing.

1070
00:54:40.278 --> 00:54:42.903
I-I-I can still run the tracks.
but. I mean. that's gonna take--

1071
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:44.446
It could take days
for those to be processed

1072
00:54:44.532 --> 00:54:46.407
and for us
to get the results back.

1073

1074

I'd like to come by

Honestly. I would
really appreciate that.

1078

You know.
there's one more thing.

1079
00:55:05.511 --> 00:55:07.919

for you to share

with the station.

I emailed myself the photos

1090

I mean. it's just
a random assemblage of letters.

1207
01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:30.912
Really? There's no footprint
or info on Nat Gevest.

1208
01:02:30.998 --> 01:02:33.749
Millie's dad is rich.
and she just aced the SATs

1209
01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:35.667
along with
some of her other rich pals

1210
01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:38.703
just by taking a prep course.
the one that is run

1211
01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:40.964
by an anagrammed name
for her dad?

1212
01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:43.258
Okay. I-I mean. it is weird

1213
01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:45.376
but I just feel like
it's a coincidence.

1214
01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:47.512
It's not a coincidence. Mon.

1215
01:02:48.182 --> 01:02:50.015
Okay. fine.

1216
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.100
[music continues]

1217
01:02:52.186 --> 01:02:53.643
[line ringing]

1218
01:02:53.729 --> 01:02:55.937
(Jackson on voicemail)
'This is Jax. Leave a message.'

1219
01:02:56.023 --> 01:03:01.026
Jax. Nat Gevest is an anagram
for Steve Gant. Millie's dad.

1220
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.737
- 'Call me when you can.'
- Kaley.

1221
01:03:03.864 --> 01:03:06.564
Clea definitely
knew something. okay?

1222
01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:09.567
So you have to be careful.
please.

1223
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.745
- I promise.
- Thank you.

1224
01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:14.748
- 'Are we leaving?'
- Yeah. Come on.

1225
01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.708
Let's get out of here.

1226
01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:18.585
- Hold on. wait! Oh!
- Come on.

1227
01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:20.170
I'm slower than you.

1228
01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:22.130
[music continues]

1229
01:03:22.216 --> 01:03:25.133
So what can I help you two
with today?

1230
01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:28.086
Are you aware that Gevest Prep.
the company that ran

1231
01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.097
the latest SAT prep course
is actually connected

1232
01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:32.849
to Steve Gant.
Millie Gant's father?

1233
01:03:32.935 --> 01:03:34.309
I am.

1234
01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:36.928
Oh. I didn't know
it was public knowledge.

1235
01:03:37.022 --> 01:03:38.438
If it's not public knowledge

1236
01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:39.597
how is it
that you know his connection?

1237
01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:40.982
I just. I did some digging

1238
01:03:41.068 --> 01:03:42.609
I'm pretty proficient
at the Internet.

1239
01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:45.445
If Mr. Gant is the proprietor.
how is that illicit?

1240
01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:47.989
- Are you kidding? That is tot--
- Kaley.

1241
01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:50.784
So you're telling me
that if I ran an SAT course

1242
01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:53.111
and my daughter
and her friends attended

1243
01:03:53.205 --> 01:03:54.287
that wouldn't be a problem?

1244
01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:55.622
Certainly not. as long

1245
01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:57.207
as it was an accredited course

1246
01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:59.000
recognized
by the college boards..

1247
01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.627
- It would be fine.
- Really?

1248
01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:02.462
You don't find it strange

1249
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.464
that after taking
her dad's class

1250
01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:06.591
'Millie suddenly aces the SAT'

1251
01:04:06.677 --> 01:04:07.968
along with her friends
who don't normally--

1252
01:04:08.095 --> 01:04:09.469
(Wells)
It is not illegal for one of

1253
01:04:09.596 --> 01:04:11.629
our most active
and involved donors

1254
01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:14.683
to want his daughter
and others to succeed.

1255
01:04:14.768 --> 01:04:17.135
Kaley. it's only a test.

1256
01:04:17.229 --> 01:04:19.855
Your records speak for you.

1257
01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:21.690
Thank you for your time.

1258
01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:25.360
That's it.
I'm gonna get to the bottom

1259
01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:27.195
of this one way or another.

1260
01:04:27.281 --> 01:04:29.981
Hold on.
I have a message from Jackson.

1261
01:04:30.075 --> 01:04:31.316
(Jackson on voicemail)
'Hey. hope you're okay.'

1262
01:04:31.410 --> 01:04:33.076
'I am getting closer
to the camera creeper.'

1263
01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:35.829
'Shouldn't be long. I'll
call you super soon. Love you.'

1264
01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:38.323
I'm gonna call Carl on the way
home. give him an update.

1265
01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:40.325
I don't care
what Principal Wells says

1266
01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:43.336
Steve Gant's involvement
is a conflict of interest. What?

1267
01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.589
Tonight we have our game
against Parsons.

1268
01:04:45.674 --> 01:04:47.799
- I think you should skip it.
- Mom. I can't miss it.

1269
01:04:47.885 --> 01:04:49.551
That would jeopardize
my co-captain status. I can't--

1270
01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:50.969
- Honey. it's just--
- 'Mom.'

1271
01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:52.345
It's here. it's a home game.

1272
01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:53.930
- It's too risky.
- It's fine.

1273
01:04:54.016 --> 01:04:56.016
It's a huge game.
I'll be surrounded by people

1274
01:04:56.143 --> 01:04:58.676
and I'll text you
every ten minutes.

1275
01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.812
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

So proud of you!
I'm so proud of you.

1287
01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:51.738
That was so good.

What is your problem. Millie?

1294
01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:13.918
What are you and your mom
talking about my dad for?

1295
01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:16.587
His SAT class that you and
your friends paid big money for

1296
01:06:16.682 --> 01:06:18.765
you know. the one that got you
all over 1400.

1297
01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:21.643
Shut up! Just shut up!

1298
01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:23.937
I studied so hard
for that test!

1299
01:06:24.064 --> 01:06:25.438
Why is it okay for you
to keep insisting

1300
01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:27.399
that I'm too stupid
to get a good score?

1301
01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.401
I can. you know?
I'm smart. Kaley!

1302
01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:31.194
There's just
too many questions. Millie.

1303
01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:32.770
It's too high for anyone.
not just you.

1304
01:06:32.864 --> 01:06:35.440
But you don't know everything!

1305
01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:37.033
You're just jealous and upset

1306
01:06:37.119 --> 01:06:39.619
that you didn't do as well
as stupid Millie.

1307
01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.663
You've always thought you were
so much better than everyone.

1308
01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:44.949
- No. I don't!
- Yes. you do!

1309
01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:46.617
And now you just wanna ruin it
for everyone else.

Now do you believe me?

1317
01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:22.203
I'm telling you.
Millie is in on this.

1318
01:07:22.289 --> 01:07:24.372
She just freaked out
at the chance that I expose her.

1319
01:07:24.458 --> 01:07:26.666
We just don't know that
for sure.

You didn't see the look
in her eyes. Monica.

- She is moody!

I promise you. babe.
it's literally all in your head.

1323
01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:38.678
You're gonna be fine. Do you
want me to stay here with you?

1324
01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.597
I'm okay. I'll be fine.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1325

- For winning.

Nothing a few aspirin
and a bag of ice can't fix.

1377
01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:00.645
I talked to Carl.
and he agrees we have to file

1378
01:10:00.739 --> 01:10:02.280
a police report
first thing in the morning.

1379
01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:04.657
No. I-I'm okay.

1380
01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:07.243
(Fiona)
Honestly. I-I can't thank you
enough. Monica.

1381
01:10:07.329 --> 01:10:08.995
I mean. if you hadn't have
been there. then--

1382
01:10:09.122 --> 01:10:11.164
But she was.
Mom. don't go there.

1383
01:10:11.291 --> 01:10:13.991
It's just.
I can't. I can't even imagine--

1384
01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:18.171
Then don't. I'm okay.
Bruised. but I'm okay.

1385
01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:21.165
And we'll spill everything to
the police tomorrow. I promise.

1386
01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.551
Millie and her dad are
not gonna get away with this.

1387
01:10:23.637 --> 01:10:25.678
Kay. it-it couldn't
have been Millie.

1388
01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:28.723
I watched her leave
before I came back to get you.

1389
01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:32.060
And Mr. Gant just wouldn't.
He's way too cute for that.

1390
01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:34.187
[chuckling]

1391
01:10:34.314 --> 01:10:36.105
Okay. now I gotta go

1392
01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:38.942
but I'm so glad
that you're okay.

1393
01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:41.361
And police are gonna catch
whoever did this to you

1394
01:10:41.488 --> 01:10:43.738
before you even know it. okay?

1395
01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:44.864
Hm.

1396
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:46.241
- Goodnight.
- Oh.

1397
01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:49.577
- Thank you. sweet angel.
- Mm.

1398
01:10:49.663 --> 01:10:51.246
- I love you. guys.
- Love you. honey.

1399
01:10:51.331 --> 01:10:53.206
Love you. too.

1400
01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:54.582
- And it was a good game.
- 'Ha-ha-ha..'

1401
01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:56.251
- It was. You crushed it.
- Yeah.

1402
01:10:56.336 --> 01:11:00.213
So did you. Okay. text me
if you guys need anything.

1403
01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.589
- We will. Thanks. Mon.
- I'm here.

1404
01:11:01.675 --> 01:11:02.924
We will. honey.

1405
01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:04.634
- Night.
- Love you.

1406
01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:07.720
Honey. have you heard
from Jackson? How's he doing?

1407
01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:10.047
I don't know. I tried
to call him after the game

1408
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.716
but his phone
went straight to voicemail.

1409

1416
01:11:40.714 --> 01:11:41.754
Mom?

1417
01:11:43.717 --> 01:11:44.841
Mom?

1418
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.845
Is everything alright?

1419
01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:52.890
Mom. what?

1420
01:11:55.395 --> 01:11:57.261
- Great game tonight. Kaley.
- It's okay. baby.

1421
01:11:57.355 --> 01:12:01.649
- It's gonna be okay.
- Okay. you. sit down.

1422
01:12:01.735 --> 01:12:04.569
And you can do the honors.

1423
01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:09.282
- Mr. Gant. don't do this.
- Shut up!

1424
01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:13.661
You did this. Kaley. You just
couldn't keep your mouth shut.

1425
01:12:13.747 --> 01:12:17.248
Move! Start tying now.
There you go.

1426
01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:19.459
This could have been a whole lot
easier if you would just

1427
01:12:19.586 --> 01:12:21.336
'stop asking so many questions.'

1428
01:12:21.421 --> 01:12:23.463
- How did you--
- I saw the pizza guy.

1429
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:26.466
Paid him off. gave him a big tip
for this uniform.

1430
01:12:26.593 --> 01:12:30.720
Tighter. Now sit down.

1431
01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.639
Sit!

1432
01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:36.642
- It's okay. baby.
- Do not do anything stupid.

1433
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:38.853
- Nothing. Either of you.
- 'It's okay.'

1434
01:12:44.903 --> 01:12:47.528
It was you. You killed Clea.

1435
01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:51.482
Clever girl.

1436
01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:54.160
(Steve)
Teenage girls at a party.

1437
01:12:54.287 --> 01:12:56.579
Anything can happen.

1438
01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:59.582
You really shouldn't have
left her alone.

1439
01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:02.159
Then again.
she brought it on herself.

1440
01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:04.837
I did what had to be done.

1441
01:13:04.964 --> 01:13:06.798
I protect my family.

1442
01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:10.176
Clea. what are you doing
out here?

1443
01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:11.886
I mean. everyone's downstairs.

1444
01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:13.838
Mr. Gant. I just want out.

1445
01:13:13.932 --> 01:13:16.265
Please. I'll pay you both back.
I just want my mom's ring.

1446
01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:18.008
'I had no idea
it was gonna be like this.'

1447
01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:19.644
What are you trying to say.
Clea?

1448
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:22.647
Everyone who took that
prep class scored above a 1400.

1449
01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:25.024
It's impossible.
I jumped almost 400 points

1450
01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:28.736
from my practice tests. Someone
clearly doctored our tests.

1451
01:13:28.822 --> 01:13:30.029
I don't trust the proctor.

1452
01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:32.907
I-I think he had something to do
with it.

1453
01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:34.992
It's a serious accusation.

1454
01:13:35.829 --> 01:13:38.996
One that ruins lives.

1455
01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:40.957
Look. I just want
my mother's ring.

1456
01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:44.043
I just can't do this.
Please. I won't say anything.

1457
01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:47.380
That's okay. Don't worry. Clea.

1458
01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:49.924
I know you won't say anything.

1459

All I really wanted to do was
to scare you. That's it. Kaley.

1470
01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:26.252
But. apparently. for a smart
girl. you can be pretty thick

1471
01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:28.671
'cause I tried several times
to stop you

1472

but you just
wouldn't stop digging.

- Digging. digging. digging.

1474

We want what's best

01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:37.889
But the pressure was too much
and i-it probably

1476
01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:39.765
pushed Millie to cheat.

1477
01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:42.426
Yeah. that's right.
the pressure. Oh. it's intense.

1478
01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.104
But as a parent.
I need to protect her.

1479
01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.607
You know. the expectations
on these colleges

1480
01:14:47.734 --> 01:14:49.108
this is ridiculous.

1481
01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:50.860
- I get it.
- No. you do not!

1482
01:14:50.945 --> 01:14:54.071
And I do not need to hear
another word out of your mouth.

1483
01:14:56.493 --> 01:14:57.492
I gave these kids an edge.

1484
01:14:57.577 --> 01:14:59.327
- Nat Gevest.
- Oh.

1485
01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:01.996
[snaps fingers]
Hm. That's very good.

1486
01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:06.167
We heard a lot through
your computer. Kaley. Please.

1487
01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:09.295
I provide a service
for the kids who don't have 4.0

1488
01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:11.380
and yet they can afford to pay.

1489
01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:13.457
And you know
what they get in return?

1490
01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:15.793
'A guarantee
that their test score'

1491
01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:18.462
is gonna be seen
by all the colleges.

1492
01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:19.964
They'll notice. You see there?

1493
01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:22.132
That's a little win-win
for everybody.

1494
01:15:22.227 --> 01:15:23.851
- Not just you. sweetheart.
- They cheated.

1495
01:15:23.937 --> 01:15:26.646
They rigged the system.
No one wins. not even them!

1496
01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:28.147
Yeah. well. except
they didn't know they cheated.

1497
01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:30.983
See. that's the beauty of it
right there.

1498
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.903
See. Millie thinks
that she actually got that score

1499
01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:36.146
on her own merit.
so she owns it.

1500
01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:38.324
And you know
what's actually pretty funny?

1501
01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:40.985
She didn't do too badly in her
junior year. but she needed me

1502
01:15:41.079 --> 01:15:44.413
and I needed
to give her the edge.

1503
01:15:47.794 --> 01:15:50.503
- How did you do it?
- What?

1504
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:54.006
I'm just curious
about the logistics.

1505
01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:56.342
- Oh. you're curious?
- Yeah.

1506
01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:59.262
I am.

1507
01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:02.848
(Steve)
I paid the proctor.
Simple. really.

1508
01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:05.351
Librarians make so little money and I just found someone

1509
01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:08.104
who was easily manipulated.

1510
01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:10.273
The kids who took
the prep class were on a list

1511
01:16:10.358 --> 01:16:13.526
which Clark cross-referenced
with their licenses.

1512
01:16:13.653 --> 01:16:15.027
(Fiona)
Why?

1513
01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:16.070
(Steve)
So Clark would easily know

1514
01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:17.738
which test to replace.

1515
01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:22.118
(Grant)
'Well. no one was the wiser.'

1516
01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:23.995
Oh. would have been perfect
if Clea hadn't gotten

1517
01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.413
all worked up about it.

1518
01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:27.373
I couldn't trust her
to shut her mouth

1519
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.084
so I took every necessary step
to protect Millie

1520
01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:33.754
and I'll protect myself.
of course.

1521
01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:36.549
Then I heard the proctor
wanted to talk to you. Kaley

1522
01:16:36.676 --> 01:16:38.926
so I had to prevent that
from happening..

1523
01:16:41.014 --> 01:16:42.388
...'cause I am all Millie has

1524
01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:46.225
and I will never let her down.

1525
01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:48.060
But unfortunately.
you two and that boy

1526
01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:50.563
just couldn't stay in your lane.

1527
01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:54.442
So now I have to clean
everything up.

1528
01:16:56.696 --> 01:16:57.778
Hm.

1529
01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:02.575
I thought planting that test
in your locker

1530
01:17:02.702 --> 01:17:04.910
would just discredit you

1531
01:17:05.038 --> 01:17:07.330
make you seem bitter
if you did find something.

1532
01:17:07.415 --> 01:17:10.741
But you just would not stop.

1533
01:17:10.835 --> 01:17:13.961
But I liked you. Kaley.
I really liked you.

1534
01:17:14.047 --> 01:17:16.297
So I thought you were a good
influence for my little girl.

1535
01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:20.343
So I am truly sorry
about the horrible kitchen fire

1536
01:17:20.428 --> 01:17:24.388
that was caused
by faulty wiring.

1537

[choking]

1538
01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:29.352

1540
01:17:32.357 --> 01:17:35.358
[breathing heavily]

1541
01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:38.778
- Huh!
