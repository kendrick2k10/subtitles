00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:21.000
from Nueva Jersey.

123

for "New Jersey."

about Spanish?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.864

with me for a couple of days.

132
00:04:40.137 --> 00:04:40.980

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.623

134

135
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.980
And we went.

136
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.933
And it was exactly

137
00:04:48.973 --> 00:04:49.980
what I had imagined.

138
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.527
It was in the woods

139
00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:52.980
of Topanga Canyon.

140
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.698
And we get there and there's

141
00:04:54.738 --> 00:04:55.980
just girls everywhere

142
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.980
and Lululemon everywhere.

152

153
00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:19.980
three veterinarians

154
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.980

156
00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.980

00:05:33.404 --> 00:05:33.980

164
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.980
Like. the intention's nice.

165
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.670
Oh. you wanna

166

work with animals. great.

167
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.980
They're just too vague.

168
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.749
All of their answers

169
00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:41.980
are too vague.

170
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.552
I've had too many

171
00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:42.980
rescue dogs--

172
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.005
I've had seven or eight--

173
00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:44.980
and I've brought them in

174
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.458
every single time

175
00:05:46.498 --> 00:05:48.980
to find out how old they are.

176
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.168
And no matter

177
00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:51.980
what vet I'm seeing.

178
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.980
the answer is the same.

179
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.231
"They're somewhere between

180
00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:59.000
the ages of 4 and 12."

181
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.980
What kind of answer is that?

182
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.209
What kind of margin of error--

183
00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:07.980
are you a doctor or not?

184
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.814
You can tell--we know

185
00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:11.980
that kangaroos were alive

186
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.980
on the island of Australia

187
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.980
25 million years ago

188
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.980
because of a half of a tooth.

189
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.625
And you can't tell me how old

190
00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:24.980
this fuckin' chow chow is?

191
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.399
I mean. honestly.

192
00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:28.000
go fuck yourselves.

193
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.601
So anyway.

194
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:32.980
we're at this retreat.

195
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.515
and I was already--you know.

196
00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:35.980
I already have the attitude

197
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.980
that I'm not into this stuff.

198
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.955
but I was trying

199
00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:38.980
to be open-minded

200
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.159
because of the level

201
00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:40.980
of my outrage.

202
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.717
So then I heard that there was

203
00:06:42.757 --> 00:06:44.077
gonna be a sound bath.

204
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.980
I didn't know--in the woods.

205
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.724
I didn't know

206
00:06:47.764 --> 00:06:48.980
what a sound bath was.

207
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.093
I thought. oh.

208
00:06:50.133 --> 00:06:52.000
DJs will shower with us.

209
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.980
And we go up to the woods

210
00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.768
and there's

211
00:06:58.808 --> 00:06:59.980
more stretching--

212
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.881
you know.

213
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:02.980
camel toe everywhere.

214
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.980
So annoying.

215
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.122
Kale chips--I'm like.

216
00:07:06.162 --> 00:07:07.122
it's 85 degrees.

217
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.732
Who wants to

218
00:07:08.772 --> 00:07:10.000
suck on a kale chip?

219
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.921
And then I saw a ukulele.

220
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:12.980
I'm like. oh. no. you don't.

221
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.933
Okay. I know that is

222
00:07:13.973 --> 00:07:14.980
gonna end up somewhere

223
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.000
that I'm not gonna like. okay.

224
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.095
This is g--classic. classic

225
00:07:20.135 --> 00:07:22.000
finger blasting setting.

226
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.480
Fool me once.

227
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.980
shame on you.

228
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.224
Fool me twice.

229
00:07:27.264 --> 00:07:29.000
shame on my Pikachu.

230
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.705
So I walked out.

231
00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:33.980
and I found some other girl.

232
00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.988
I left the woods and I'm like.

233
00:07:36.028 --> 00:07:37.980
"Hey. you. what's--what's up?"

234
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.980
Who's got drugs?"

235
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.188
And she's like. "W-well.

236
00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:42.980
we're having a--

237
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.248
"we're having a ceremony

238
00:07:44.288 --> 00:07:44.980
tomorrow night

239
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.980
"with--with toad venom.

240
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.000
And it's called 5-DME-OT."

241
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.150
And I was like. "Okay. well.

242
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:52.980
I'll take mine now."

243
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.000
[laughter]

244
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.980
Let's party.

245
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.209
And she said. "It's not really

246
00:08:02.249 --> 00:08:02.980
that kind of drug."

247
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:03.678
I'm like. "Listen. bitch.

248
00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:03.980
I'll decide

249
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.980
what kind of drug this is."

250
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.201
Now. I understand

251
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:09.980
some people are not built

252
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.057
for drugs and alcohol.

253
00:08:11.097 --> 00:08:11.980
and I respect that.

254
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.188
I don't ever want to get

255
00:08:13.228 --> 00:08:13.980
anybody involved

256
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.008
with drugs and alcohol

257
00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:15.980
that can't handle it.

258
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.980
but I believe that I am.

259
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.582
I believe that I'm built

260
00:08:20.622 --> 00:08:21.980
for the apocalypse...

261
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.000
which. by the way. we're in.

262
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.980
I've done every drug.

263
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.018
I've experimented

264
00:08:28.058 --> 00:08:28.980
with everything.

265
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.428
Unless there's a new drug

266
00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:31.980
that came out this morning.

267
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.000
I've tried it.

268
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.980
I did a special on Netflix.

269
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.039
I went down to Peru

270
00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:38.099
and did ayahuasca

271
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.980
on camera with a shaman.

272
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.738
and they said.

273
00:08:41.778 --> 00:08:42.980
"No. you can't do that.

274
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:44.395
People vomit

275
00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:46.980
and shit their pants."

276
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.980
I was like. "I won't.

277
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.395
I won't do that.

278
00:08:51.435 --> 00:08:53.000
I'm too advanced."

279
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.446
I'm like. "You think I'm gonna

280
00:08:55.486 --> 00:08:55.980
ruin a buzz

281
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:56.980
"by defecating on myself?

282
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.151
Never is that going

283
00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:01.980
to happen."

284
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.792
I took my SATs

285
00:09:03.832 --> 00:09:05.980
tripping on acid.

286
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.980
I didn't get into college.

287
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.246
but I had a great time

288
00:09:09.286 --> 00:09:11.000
taking that test.

289
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.800
And I've never had a bad time.

290
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.843
Like. you know somebody--

291
00:09:19.883 --> 00:09:19.980
oh--

292
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.412
everybody always has

293
00:09:21.452 --> 00:09:22.980
a bad time with drugs.

294
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:23.929
There's always a girl in

295
00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:25.589
the corner for eight hours.

296
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.980
like... [gibbers]

297
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.980
That's never me.

298
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.605
Okay. I've had never

299
00:09:30.645 --> 00:09:31.980
a bad experience.

300
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.117
Nothing that I would frame

301
00:09:33.157 --> 00:09:33.980
as negative. anyway.

302
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.676
The one time--one time. I had

303
00:09:36.716 --> 00:09:38.980
a questionable experience

304
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.174
was when cannabis--

305
00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:41.980
this was. like. 15 years ago.

306
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.867
before cannabis

307
00:09:42.907 --> 00:09:43.980
was the way it was.

308
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.980
before there were labels.

309
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.404
And a man had given me

310
00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:49.980
a cookie.

311
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.980
And I ate that cookie.

312
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.985
And I thought I was

313
00:09:54.025 --> 00:09:55.980
at a movie theater.

314
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.019
And when the movie ended. I got

315
00:09:58.059 --> 00:09:59.980
up to leave the movie theater.

316
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.716
only to find out

317
00:10:01.756 --> 00:10:04.000
I was on an airplane.

318
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.980
That was shocking.

319
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.980
'Cause I didn't just get up;

320
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.980
I got my shit together.

321
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:16.834
I got my coat.

322
00:10:16.874 --> 00:10:17.980
and it had a belt--

323
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.980
it must have been winter.

324
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.420
And then I got my bag

325
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.980
out of the overhead bin

326
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.527
and pulled it down as if that's

327
00:10:25.567 --> 00:10:27.980
how you leave a movie theater.

328
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.592
It never occurred to me

329
00:10:28.632 --> 00:10:28.980
this isn't what

330
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.769
you've ever done

331
00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:31.309
leaving a theater before.

332
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.980
I just--it was rote.

333
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.291
I was like.

334
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:33.980
"Oh. I better get my bag.

335
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.980
I better get my things."

336
00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.980
And then I was like. yeah.

337
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:39.720
Up the aisle to--

338
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.980
straight to the little window

339
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.145
that you look out

340
00:10:42.185 --> 00:10:43.980
if you're trying to escape.

341
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:44.798
And I'm looking at

342
00:10:44.838 --> 00:10:45.980
the other passengers like.

343
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.360
what are these idiots

344
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.000
waiting for. the credits?

345
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.793
I was staring out

346
00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:54.333
that little bagel window.

347
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.980
you know. like. wha--

348
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.820
and then I feel tap. tap. tap.

349
00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.862
And I turn around. and

350
00:10:58.902 --> 00:11:00.582
the flight attendant's like.

351
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.087
"Sweetie. there are three more

352
00:11:03.127 --> 00:11:05.000
hours left on this flight."

353
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.500
And I was like. "I know."

354
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.780
I was like. "I'm going

355
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.980
to the bathroom to change."

356
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:14.673
Just layered on my lies.

357
00:11:14.713 --> 00:11:14.980
I was like.

358
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.144
"Hoo. yum--

359
00:11:16.184 --> 00:11:18.980
you're not gonna shame me."

360
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.127
And then I walked up

361
00:11:20.167 --> 00:11:21.067
to the bathroom

362
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and shoved my suitcase inside.

363
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.767
Apparently not only

364
00:11:25.807 --> 00:11:26.980
was I not at a movie theater.

365
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.292
I had never flown

366
00:11:28.332 --> 00:11:29.980
on an airplane before.

367
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:31.141
and knowing that you can't

368
00:11:31.181 --> 00:11:31.980
bring your suitcase

369
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.320
into that little

370
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.980
urine-soaked wet box

371
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:37.773
and change your outfit.

372
00:11:37.813 --> 00:11:38.980
but I did.

373
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.039
I put on a tube top

374
00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:40.980
to prove a point.

375
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.892
And I walked back out

376
00:11:42.932 --> 00:11:44.980
with my head held high.

377
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.612
I was like.

378
00:11:45.652 --> 00:11:46.980
do not make eye contact!

379
00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.000
You are a queen!

380
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.910
I sat back down in my seat.

381
00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:58.980
and I was like.

382
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.980
"Hmm. what's next?"

383
00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.261
It's like. this is like

384
00:12:02.301 --> 00:12:02.980
an adventure.

385
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.980
I wonder where I'm going.

386
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.801
And who's gonna pick me up

387
00:12:08.841 --> 00:12:09.980
when I get there?

388
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.942
And then I put in another

389
00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:13.980
movie. and I watched that.

390
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:14.628
And when that ended.

391
00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:14.980
I was like.

392
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.980
"Do not get up. bitch."

393
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:17.980
It's like. "Do not get up."

394
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:18.431
And then I wrote

395
00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:19.671
on a piece of paper.

396
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
"You are on a plane."

397
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.303
It's not like you can look over

398
00:12:27.343 --> 00:12:27.980
at your neighbor

399
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.980
and be like. "Hey...

400
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.444
speaking of nothing.

401
00:12:32.484 --> 00:12:34.000
where are we headed?"

402
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.165
Anyway. so. that was the worst

403
00:12:38.205 --> 00:12:39.980
experience I've ever had.

404
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.277
and I would frame that

405
00:12:41.317 --> 00:12:41.980
as a B-plus.

406
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.224
So I'm back at the retreat

407
00:12:43.264 --> 00:12:43.980
and this woman--

408
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.062
I don't remember her name.

409
00:12:46.102 --> 00:12:47.980
who had the toad venom--

410
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:51.000
um. we'll call her Sierra Mist.

411
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.980
So she and I are walking down

412
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.404
to this. like. cottage

413
00:12:55.444 --> 00:12:55.980
to do it.

414
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.825
and then this other

415
00:12:56.865 --> 00:12:57.980
dipsy doodle comes running

416
00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.517
out of the bushes

417
00:12:58.557 --> 00:12:58.980
and she's like.

418
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.980
"Are you guys getting high?"

419
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.980
I'm like. "Back the fuck up."

420
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:03.670
First of all.

421
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:04.980
I don't like interlopers.

422
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.980
you know what I mean?

423
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:07.614
I don't wanna do drugs

424
00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:07.980
with somebody

425
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.980
if it's their first time.

426
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.631
I don't have time

427
00:13:10.671 --> 00:13:11.980
for that shit.

428
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.210
And a lot of people

429
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.980
depend on me

430
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.456
because I'm kind of like

431
00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:16.980
a pharmacological intuit.

432
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:17.880
Like. I could look

433
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.240
at you and say. "Okay.

434
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.680
"you're gonna thrive on

435
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:20.980
this drug.

436
00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:21.989
"you're gonna do

437
00:13:22.029 --> 00:13:22.980
better on Xanax.

438
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.980
"you might prefer a Vicodin.

439
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.980
you might like an Adderall."

440
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.803
Like. I can tell

441
00:13:26.843 --> 00:13:27.980
by looking at your body

442
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:28.515
and talking to you

443
00:13:28.555 --> 00:13:28.980
for five minutes

444
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:30.852
what drug you are going

445
00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:32.000
to respond to.

446
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.922
Don't talk to me about

447
00:13:33.962 --> 00:13:34.980
melatonin either. people.

448
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.980
Okay?

449
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.980
Melatonin is for beginners.

450
00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:40.405
Talk to me after

451
00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:41.765
you've taken an Ambien

452
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.695
and woken up at

453
00:13:42.735 --> 00:13:43.980
a Harrah's blackjack table.

454
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.497
$500 up.

455
00:13:44.537 --> 00:13:45.980
with your eyeshades on.

456
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.457
Then you can talk to me

457
00:13:47.497 --> 00:13:49.000
about fuckin' melatonin.

458
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.496
So a lot of people know this

459
00:13:54.536 --> 00:13:54.980
about me.

460
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.020
Like. my sister.

461
00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:56.980
she had trouble

462
00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:58.290
making speeches at work.

463
00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.980
'cause she would get dry mouth.

464
00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.828
So I prescribed her

465
00:14:01.868 --> 00:14:02.980
propranolol.

466
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.980
That's a beta blocker.

467
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.515
I said. "Take one 30 minutes

468
00:14:06.555 --> 00:14:07.980
before you speak publicly."

469
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.000
She's been promoted twice.

470
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.980
She called me.

471
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:18.980
She's like. "Thank God we have

472
00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.980
a doctor in the family."

473
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.980
Magnesium O7 by Aerobic Life

474
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.065
for women who have trouble

475
00:14:24.105 --> 00:14:24.980
going to the bathroom.

476
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.980
A lot of women have trouble

477
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.665
going to the bathroom

478
00:14:26.705 --> 00:14:26.980
every day.

479
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:28.389
If you take three of those

480
00:14:28.429 --> 00:14:28.980
every night

481
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.081
for three nights.

482
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:30.980
you would have

483
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.744
solid shidoobees

484
00:14:31.784 --> 00:14:32.980
for the rest of your life.

485
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.854
If you take four.

486
00:14:33.894 --> 00:14:34.980
you will get diarrhea.

487
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.986
Some girls like that.

488
00:14:36.026 --> 00:14:36.980
If you do. take four.

489
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.980
You'll get it.

490
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.987
Doxycycline will kill anything

491
00:14:41.027 --> 00:14:41.980
in your system.

492
00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.980
I mean. acne and malaria.

493
00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.083
Two doxycycline

494
00:14:46.123 --> 00:14:47.980
twice a day for ten days--

495
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:48.980
never on an empty stomach.

496
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.980
You'll vomit. okay?

497
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.057
It will knock anything

498
00:14:52.097 --> 00:14:52.980
out of your system.

499
00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.487
I take one every morning

500
00:14:54.527 --> 00:14:56.000
just not to fuck around.

501
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.980
But I looked at this girl.

502
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.909
this other 7UP Light girl

503
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:02.980
that came out of the woods.

504
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:03.989
and I could tell

505
00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:04.980
by her body type

506
00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.559
that I didn't want her

507
00:15:06.599 --> 00:15:07.980
to rain on my party.

508
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.433
And a lot of people think.

509
00:15:09.473 --> 00:15:10.980
oh. heavier or taller people

510
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.586
can handle

511
00:15:11.626 --> 00:15:12.980
more drugs and alcohol.

512
00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.980
That is not true either.

513
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.535
It's those skinny

514
00:15:15.575 --> 00:15:15.980
little bitches

515
00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.980
you have to watch out for.

516
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:19.468
the ones who can

517
00:15:19.508 --> 00:15:19.980
do coke all night

518
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:20.836
and then take one of

519
00:15:20.876 --> 00:15:21.980
those Lime scooters to work

520
00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:22.980
in the morning.

521
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.980
[laughter]

522
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:27.018
So I ixnayed her.

523
00:15:27.058 --> 00:15:27.980
I said. "Listen.

524
00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.514
I'm gonna do this. sweetie.

525
00:15:29.554 --> 00:15:30.980
and I'll get back to you."

526
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:32.580
So I go down with Sierra.

527
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.980
we go to this cottage.

528
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.953
and she's like.

529
00:15:34.993 --> 00:15:35.980
"Okay. you know.

530
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.186
this is gonna be

531
00:15:37.226 --> 00:15:38.980
about 10 or 12 minutes."

532
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.980
And I'm like. "Huh? What?"

533
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.085
Like. "That's not fun.

534
00:15:42.125 --> 00:15:42.980
10 or 12 minutes."

535
00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.753
And she's like.

536
00:15:43.793 --> 00:15:44.980
"Well. if you can han--"

537
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.545
I go. "Just give me

538
00:15:45.585 --> 00:15:45.980
a double dose."

539
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.161
And she said. "No.

540
00:15:47.201 --> 00:15:48.980
why don't you try it first?"

541
00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:49.275
She says.

542
00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:50.635
"It's transcendental."

543
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.980
is the word that she used.

544
00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.980
So I was already bored.

545
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.084
And then she said.

546
00:15:56.124 --> 00:15:57.980
"You need to set an intention."

547
00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:58.647
I was like...

548
00:15:58.687 --> 00:15:59.980
[chuckles] "I don't care."

549
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.027
You know. "Why don't you

550
00:16:01.067 --> 00:16:01.980
set one for me. okay?"

551
00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:02.750
And she said.

552
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.980
"You need to set it."

553
00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:04.713
I'm like.

554
00:16:04.753 --> 00:16:06.980
"To be less of a cunt. okay?

555
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:07.980
"Is that an intention?

556
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.792
'Cause I would

557
00:16:09.832 --> 00:16:11.980
like to do that."

558
00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:12.455
So I take a hit.

559
00:16:12.495 --> 00:16:12.980
and it's in. like.

560
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.484
a little crack pipe.

561
00:16:15.524 --> 00:16:16.980
or whatever.

562
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:17.892
I take a hit.

563
00:16:17.932 --> 00:16:19.980
and it's immediately terrible.

564
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.760
Like. the most terrible thi--

565
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.206
dark. swirly greens

566
00:16:23.246 --> 00:16:23.980
and purples.

567
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:24.931
It was like I was

568
00:16:24.971 --> 00:16:25.980
on a roller coaster

569
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.098
and my head was in a vice

570
00:16:27.138 --> 00:16:27.980
and I couldn't move.

571
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.422
And then I open my eye;

572
00:16:29.462 --> 00:16:29.980
I'm like.

573
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.699
"Oh. fuck.

574
00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:31.980
She's still here."

575
00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:32.929
I was like. "Mm.

576
00:16:32.969 --> 00:16:33.980
I don't like this.

577
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:34.545
I don't like this."

578
00:16:34.585 --> 00:16:35.485
and I was like.

579
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.980
"Oh. oh. oh. oh. you're--

580
00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.980
"you're gonna pass away today.

581
00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.340
Oh. that's

582
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:39.980
what's happening."

583
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.798
And then I'm like.

584
00:16:40.838 --> 00:16:41.980
"No. don't be so dramatic.

585
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:42.966
"You're not gonna pass away.

586
00:16:43.006 --> 00:16:43.980
You've received brain damage.

587
00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:44.771
"but you're already

588
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:45.980
a little bit on the spectrum.

589
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.980
so don't even worry. like"--

590
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.256
not that people on the spectrum

591
00:16:49.296 --> 00:16:49.980
have brain damage.

592
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.987
but I definitely have it.

593
00:16:52.027 --> 00:16:53.980
and I'm on some spectrum.

594
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.063
So I'm sitting there.

595
00:16:55.103 --> 00:16:55.980
and I am sweating.

596
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.072
like. just drenched

597
00:16:57.112 --> 00:16:58.072
in my own sweat.

598
00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.544
And so I'm ripping

599
00:16:59.584 --> 00:16:59.980
my clothes off

600
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.283
and I'm hyperventilating

601
00:17:01.323 --> 00:17:01.980
and I'm like.

602
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.536
"Oh. don't say anything.

603
00:17:02.576 --> 00:17:02.980
don't say anything."

604
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.171
And when I couldn't

605
00:17:04.211 --> 00:17:04.980
wait anymore.

606
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:05.263
I was like.

607
00:17:05.303 --> 00:17:06.983
"You have to make this stop.

608
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.980
I'm in a matrix."

609
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:09.642
And she puts her hand

610
00:17:09.682 --> 00:17:09.980
on my chest

611
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.861
in between my naked boobs

612
00:17:11.901 --> 00:17:12.980
and she's like.

613
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.920
"It's okay.

614
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.980
Shh.

615
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:17.881
You're in

616
00:17:17.921 --> 00:17:19.980
a parallel universe."

617
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:20.850
I was like. "Bitch.

618
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:21.980
I don't have any Bitcoin.

619
00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.000
Get me out of there."

620
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.530
And finally. I started

621
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:26.980
to come out of it.

622
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.064
and I was so. first of all.

623
00:17:29.104 --> 00:17:29.980
embarrassed.

624
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.000
'cause I was nude...

625
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.666
And that I had

626
00:17:34.706 --> 00:17:35.980
just lost complete control.

627
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.980
I was like. "Oh. my God."

628
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:38.498
And I open my eyes

629
00:17:38.538 --> 00:17:39.558
and I look at her

630
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.480
and I look down at my body

631
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.080
and I was completely nude.

632
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:44.636
And I had forgotten that.

633
00:17:44.676 --> 00:17:45.456
that morning.

634
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.980
I had put on nude underwear.

635
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.430
So when I looked down.

636
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.980
I just saw a bald bump.

637
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.980
And I was like.

638
00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.980
"You shaved my beaver.

639
00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.810
I knew something like that

640
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.000
was gonna happen this weekend."

641
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:09.850
And then I had to

642
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:10.980
get my stuff together.

643
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.272
like with the walk of shame

644
00:18:12.312 --> 00:18:12.980
in the morning.

645
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.980
Like. turning away from her

646
00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.261
when she's already seen

647
00:18:16.301 --> 00:18:16.980
my nude body.

648
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.085
I'm. like. covering myself.

649
00:18:18.125 --> 00:18:18.980
picking up my clothes.

650
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.385
And then I'm like.

651
00:18:21.425 --> 00:18:22.980
"Thank you."

652
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:23.980
'Cause that's what girls do.

653
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.980
We say thank you

654
00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.159
even when we've had

655
00:18:27.199 --> 00:18:29.000
a terrible time.

656
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.653
So I did it two more times.

657
00:18:32.693 --> 00:18:32.980
and I'm like.

658
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.980
"I definitely don't like this."

659
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.737
And then my curiosity

660
00:18:38.777 --> 00:18:40.980
had reached its conclusion.

661
00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.455
And I figured it was time

662
00:18:42.495 --> 00:18:43.980
to go to a real therapist.

663
00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:44.980
I needed to talk to somebody.

664
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.404
but I was embarrassed that

665
00:18:46.444 --> 00:18:47.980
I needed to talk to somebody.

666
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.336
I had seen doctors

667
00:18:49.376 --> 00:18:50.980
and therapists before.

668
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.573
but never with the intention

669
00:18:52.613 --> 00:18:53.980
of. like. fixing anything

670
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.980
that really ran deep. you know.

671
00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.766
I didn't have the mental

672
00:18:57.806 --> 00:18:59.980
equipment to let anyone see me

673
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:00.446
for anything other

674
00:19:00.486 --> 00:19:00.980
than what I'd become.

675
00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.980
which was strong.

676
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:03.980
And because of that strength.

677
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.247
I wasn't about to sit

678
00:19:05.287 --> 00:19:06.980
in a doctor's office and cry.

679
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.336
Crying for other people--

680
00:19:08.376 --> 00:19:08.980
my friends--

681
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:09.980
about their problems. sure.

682
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.257
But crying for myself

683
00:19:11.297 --> 00:19:12.017
about myself

684
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.217
was absolutely

685
00:19:14.257 --> 00:19:15.980
out of the question.

686
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.769
So I sat down--

687
00:19:16.809 --> 00:19:17.980
this guy's name is Dan.

688
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.297
he's a psychiatrist--

689
00:19:19.337 --> 00:19:19.980
and I said.

690
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:20.849
"Hey. listen. I have

691
00:19:20.889 --> 00:19:21.980
a lot of anger and outrage

692
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.933
"about Donald Trump.

693
00:19:22.973 --> 00:19:23.980
and people are running

694
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.980
"when they see me coming.

695
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.909
Like. I'm losing friends.

696
00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:30.000
I'm losing family members."

697
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:31.549
And he said.

698
00:19:31.589 --> 00:19:32.980
"Okay. let's talk about that."

699
00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.172
I said. "Well. I travel a lot.

700
00:19:35.212 --> 00:19:36.980
So I'm in airports a lot.

701
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:37.858
"And I check in to

702
00:19:37.898 --> 00:19:38.980
the first-class lounge.

703
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.280
"and then I immediately go over

704
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.980
to the Fox News section

705
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.980
and start going off on people."

706
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.980
I'm like. "You fuckin' racist!"

707
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:47.980
And then I run out.

708
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.195
And then I come back

709
00:19:49.235 --> 00:19:49.980
and I'm like.

710
00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.864
"Do you have a daughter

711
00:19:50.904 --> 00:19:51.980
that doesn't have any rights?

712
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.980
'Cause she won't."

713
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:54.706
And then I run back in;

714
00:19:54.746 --> 00:19:54.980
I'm like.

715
00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.000
"Are you still a racist?"

716
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.625
And Dan is

717
00:20:04.665 --> 00:20:05.980
really understanding.

718
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.320
and he's like. "Hey. it's

719
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.980
a really tricky time right now.

720
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.980
"Emotions are high.

721
00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.235
You know. a lot of people

722
00:20:13.275 --> 00:20:14.175
are enervated."

723
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.048
And I said. "Dan. I went

724
00:20:16.088 --> 00:20:16.980
to the airport today.

725
00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.000
and I didn't have a flight."

726
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.117
I told him that. you know.

727
00:20:26.157 --> 00:20:26.980
before the election.

728
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.980
my biggest privileged decision

729
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.737
was whether or not

730
00:20:30.777 --> 00:20:32.980
to install a waterslide

731
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.013
off of my bedroom balcony

732
00:20:35.053 --> 00:20:35.980
into my pool

733
00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.145
for the next time

734
00:20:37.185 --> 00:20:39.000
my friends and I did molly.

735
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:43.831
And then I told him.

736
00:20:43.871 --> 00:20:44.980
the day after the election.

737
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:45.858
I'm driving around

738
00:20:45.898 --> 00:20:46.980
the streets of Bel Air.

739
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:47.670
where I live.

740
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.210
passing out water bottles

741
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.480
and blankets to the Mexican

742
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.980
workers in my neighborhood.

743
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.980
going. "You belong here!"

744
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.083
And them looking at me like.

745
00:20:57.123 --> 00:20:57.980
"We're not all illegal.

746
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.000
you racist bitch."

747
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.980
Cheers.

748
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.310
I told him I had read this book

749
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.980
by Viktor Frankl

750
00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:15.529
called

751
00:21:15.569 --> 00:21:17.980
"Man's Search for Meaning."

752
00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.953
and in the book

753
00:21:18.993 --> 00:21:19.980
there was a line

754
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.980
that made me put the book down.

755
00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.980
And the line said.

756
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:23.795
"Stop thinking about

757
00:21:23.835 --> 00:21:24.980
"what you expect out of life.

758
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.653
and start thinking about

759
00:21:27.693 --> 00:21:30.980
what life expects out of you."

760
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.980
And I was like. "Wait. what?"

761
00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.008
I'd never thought about what

762
00:21:34.048 --> 00:21:34.980
life was expecting from me.

763
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.444
I was thinking about

764
00:21:36.484 --> 00:21:37.980
what I was gonna get.

765
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.012
always about me and my family

766
00:21:40.052 --> 00:21:40.980
and my friends

767
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.980
and my homes. my vacations.

768
00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.980
I was taking. taking. taking.

769
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.826
without thinking

770
00:21:44.866 --> 00:21:45.980
about my contribution.

771
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.552
And I told Dan. I said.

772
00:21:47.592 --> 00:21:48.980
"I have to do better.

773
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.772
I wanna do better; I need

774
00:21:50.812 --> 00:21:52.980
somebody to help me do better."

775
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.203
I said.

776
00:21:53.243 --> 00:21:54.743
"But I feel so hopeless."

777
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.980
I mean. I had just read

778
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:56.980
an article that morning

779
00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.354
that men were

780
00:21:58.394 --> 00:22:01.000
masturbating into plants.

781
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.980
That's happening.

782
00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:06.980
When did that start. you guys?

783
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.010
Wha--please stand up

784
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:08.980
if you've done that

785
00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.980
and explain it.

786
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.980
Please. please get up.

787
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.135
If somebody's done that here.

788
00:22:15.175 --> 00:22:16.980
you need to come forward.

789
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.980
Why did that start?

790
00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.980
I mean. honestly. guys.

791
00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.485
only a man would

792
00:22:22.525 --> 00:22:23.980
do such a thing.

793
00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.980
Poor plants.

794
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:26.190
I mean.

795
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.980
they've been sitting around

796
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.320
for how many millions of

797
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.980
millennia. minding their own--

798
00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.980
giving us air to breathe.

799
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.951
And then cavemen come running

800
00:22:33.991 --> 00:22:35.980
along with their dicks waving.

801
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.233
and plants are like.

802
00:22:37.273 --> 00:22:37.980
"Oh. my God.

803
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.980
"What is gonna happen now?

804
00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.051
Are we gonna get

805
00:22:41.091 --> 00:22:42.980
ejaculated on?"

806
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:43.515
I mean. talk about

807
00:22:43.555 --> 00:22:44.515
picking a victim

808
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.980
that can't get away.

809
00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.980
Sickos.

810
00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:49.650
Only a man would see a plant

811
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:49.980
and be like...

812
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:51.980
[grunting]

813
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:52.980
Only a man would do that.

814
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.000
No woman has ever done it.

815
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.680
In the history of the world.

816
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.395
no woman is like.

817
00:22:59.435 --> 00:23:00.980
"Where's a cactus?"

818
00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:01.980
Never!

819
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.000
Never ever. ever.

820
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.980
Not one time.

821
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:07.319
I'm willing to vouch

822
00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:09.000
for all women everywhere.

823
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.179
Not in the history

824
00:23:13.219 --> 00:23:13.980
of the world

825
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.986
or in the future history

826
00:23:16.026 --> 00:23:16.980
of the world

827
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.334
will a woman ever have

828
00:23:18.374 --> 00:23:19.980
said that she has done that

829
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.980
or will we catch one doing it.

830
00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:24.670
That was

831
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.000
a disappointing revelation.

832
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.980
I mean. and it's not like

833
00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.980
women don't get turned on

834
00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.422
at inappropriate times.

835
00:23:31.462 --> 00:23:31.980
you guys.

836
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.980
We do.

837
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:34.744
I get a manicure

838
00:23:34.784 --> 00:23:35.980
and a pedicure every week.

839
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.686
And she does

840
00:23:36.726 --> 00:23:37.980
that forearm massage--

841
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.605
this spot right here

842
00:23:39.645 --> 00:23:40.980
is my sweet spot.

843
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:41.900
That's--when somebody

844
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:42.980
touches that. I'm like...

845
00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:44.980
[moaning lightly]

846
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.706
I get--like. I flutter.

847
00:23:45.746 --> 00:23:46.286
you know.

848
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:47.597
my eyes start to twitch.

849
00:23:47.637 --> 00:23:47.980
and I'm like...

850
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.980
[moans]

851
00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.530
And then I'm like.

852
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.980
open your eyes.

853
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:51.980
You're at a nail salon.

854
00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.980
You can't do that right now.

855
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.259
You're in public.

856
00:23:55.299 --> 00:23:56.980
you sick fucking bitch.

857
00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.227
You can't audibly moan

858
00:23:58.267 --> 00:23:59.980
while you're getting a massage.

859
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.980
That's not okay.

860
00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.980
And in that moment.

861
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.666
when she does that.

862
00:24:05.706 --> 00:24:06.980
I'm vulnerable.

863
00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.058
Like. I would--

864
00:24:08.098 --> 00:24:09.980
I would like it to continue

865
00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.980
in different ways. maybe.

866
00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:13.355
When she does

867
00:24:13.395 --> 00:24:13.980
the little dipsy doo--

868
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.980
if she--even if in that moment.

869
00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.030
if she tried to just go

870
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.980
a little bit too far.

871
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.170
like. up the leg.

872
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:20.980
and a little dipsy doodle.

873
00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.065
like. a little

874
00:24:22.105 --> 00:24:24.000
♪ Itsy-bitsy spider ♪

875
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.980
♪ Climbed up the water spout ♪

876
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.980
♪ Down came the rain ♪

877
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.044
If in that moment.

878
00:24:32.084 --> 00:24:32.980
she did do that.

879
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.516
I might be like. "Yeah. yeah.

880
00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:36.236
quick. quick. quick. quick."

881
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.223
"Do it. get in. get in. get in.

882
00:24:41.263 --> 00:24:42.403
quick. quick. quick

883
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.980
"before anybody else walks in.

884
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.980
Hey. come on. come on."

885
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:45.643
I might even return

886
00:24:45.683 --> 00:24:45.980
the favor.

887
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.980
I doubt it. but I might.

888
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.402
So I'm talking to

889
00:24:50.442 --> 00:24:52.980
my new psychiatrist about this.

890
00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:53.986
And I was like. "Dan.

891
00:24:54.026 --> 00:24:54.980
I'm thinking I'm lit.

892
00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.165
"You know. like. I know

893
00:24:56.205 --> 00:24:56.980
I'm. like. woke.

894
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.980
and I know my shit."

895
00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:58.957
And just that day.

896
00:24:58.997 --> 00:24:59.980
I'd started filming

897
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.110
a documentary for Netflix

898
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.980
about white privilege.

899
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.336
And on the very first day

900
00:25:05.376 --> 00:25:05.980
of shooting.

901
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:06.980
Netflix called me and said

902
00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.011
I had to go to

903
00:25:08.051 --> 00:25:09.980
sexual harassment training.

904
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:10.911
I was like...

905
00:25:10.951 --> 00:25:10.980
f

906
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.980
Again?

907
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:15.980
And I had been on set

908
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.159
and this Black woman

909
00:25:17.199 --> 00:25:17.980
sang this song

910
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.004
and I went to go hug her

911
00:25:19.044 --> 00:25:20.424
and after I hugged her.

912
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:21.980
I smacked her on the ass.

913
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.000
I said. "Way to go. sister."

914
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.980
She did not like that.

915
00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.260
But I didn't understand

916
00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.980
why I had to go to sexual har--

917
00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.131
I was like. "Why is this

918
00:25:30.171 --> 00:25:30.980
sexual harassment?

919
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.609
I'm not hitting on her.

920
00:25:31.649 --> 00:25:31.980
I'm straight."

921
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:32.797
And they're like.

922
00:25:32.837 --> 00:25:33.980
"No. it's not about that.

923
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.132
"You have to call this woman

924
00:25:35.172 --> 00:25:35.980
and apologize to her.

925
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:36.963
and you have to get her

926
00:25:37.003 --> 00:25:37.980
to accept your apology."

927
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.766
And I was like--

928
00:25:39.806 --> 00:25:41.980
and I was defensive.

929
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:42.572
And so I called her.

930
00:25:42.612 --> 00:25:42.980
and I was like

931
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:43.823
"I just--I don't--

932
00:25:43.863 --> 00:25:44.980
I was just trying to say.

933
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.349
'Hey. go girl.'

934
00:25:46.389 --> 00:25:47.980
Like. sisterhood."

935
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.320
And she said. "It doesn't

936
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.980
matter what your intention was.

937
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.460
"It's how I received it.

938
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.533
"and you--Black women

939
00:25:53.573 --> 00:25:53.980
have been defined

940
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.053
"by their hair and their asses

941
00:25:56.093 --> 00:25:57.980
since the beginning of time.

942
00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.441
You have no right

943
00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:00.980
to touch my body."

944
00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:01.980
And she was right.

945
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:02.920
I have no right

946
00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.980
to touch her body

947
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:04.980
or anybody else's.

948
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.173
So I was sitting there

949
00:26:06.213 --> 00:26:06.980
talking to Dan.

950
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.487
and I was like. "But can I

951
00:26:08.527 --> 00:26:10.087
still touch white people?"

952
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.316
And he said. "No. no. you can't

953
00:26:13.356 --> 00:26:15.000
touch anyone. Chelsea.

954
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.980
It's unwelcome."

955
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.533
And I was like. "But that's how

956
00:26:18.573 --> 00:26:19.980
my family and I communicate."

957
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.744
I see my sister.

958
00:26:20.784 --> 00:26:21.980
I grab her by the Pikachu.

959
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.980
I'm like. "Beep. beep!"

960
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.352
He's like. "You definitely

961
00:26:26.392 --> 00:26:26.980
shouldn't be

962
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.000
doing that with family."

963
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.980
And that was a wake-up call.

964
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.097
'cause she was right

965
00:26:33.137 --> 00:26:33.980
and I was wrong.

966
00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:34.466
It's not about

967
00:26:34.506 --> 00:26:34.980
your intention;

968
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.980
it's about the reception.

969
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:37.980
And any time you're defensive.

970
00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:39.582
especially about racism.

971
00:26:39.622 --> 00:26:40.980
you're fuckin' wrong.

972
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.111
And if you're a person

973
00:26:42.151 --> 00:26:42.980
who doesn't think

974
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:43.565
that "white privilege"

975
00:26:43.605 --> 00:26:43.980
is a real thing.

976
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:44.874
then you're a person

977
00:26:44.914 --> 00:26:45.980
who's choosing to be part

978
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.947
of the problem rather than

979
00:26:47.987 --> 00:26:50.000
being part of the solution.

980
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.761
Because the world is

981
00:26:57.801 --> 00:26:59.661
only getting browner and gayer.

982
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
so you better hop on board.

983
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:08.741
So that was

984
00:27:08.781 --> 00:27:09.980
lesson number one.

985
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:10.820
but not from Dan. but

986
00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.600
I talked it through with him.

987
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.025
And then he wanted to know

988
00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:14.980
about my family history.

989
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:15.644
I was like. that's not what

990
00:27:15.684 --> 00:27:15.980
this is about.

991
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.980
Nothin' to see there.

992
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.026
I was like. my brother died

993
00:27:20.066 --> 00:27:20.980
when I was a little girl;

994
00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.485
my mom died. like.

995
00:27:22.525 --> 00:27:23.980
8 or 10 years ago;

996
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:24.469
my dad's a huge

997
00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:24.980
pain in the ass.

998
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.778
so hopefully he'll wrap things

999
00:27:27.818 --> 00:27:29.000
up this year.

1000
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.594
And I said.

1001
00:27:32.634 --> 00:27:33.980
"And quite frankly. like.

1002
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:34.980
I'm ready to wrap it up. too."

1003
00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:35.215
I said.

1004
00:27:35.255 --> 00:27:35.980
"Dan. I'm not suicidal.

1005
00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.075
"You don't have to

1006
00:27:37.115 --> 00:27:37.980
worry about it.

1007
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.439
"But people say

1008
00:27:38.479 --> 00:27:38.980
life is too short.

1009
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.400
I think it's too long."

1010
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.317
Like. there's so many annoying

1011
00:27:42.357 --> 00:27:42.980
people out here

1012
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:44.980
and I just can't deal with it.

1013
00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:45.662
I said.

1014
00:27:45.702 --> 00:27:47.980
"I'm losing my patience.

1015
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.942
and I need you to help me

1016
00:27:49.982 --> 00:27:51.980
with my lack of patience."

1017
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:52.980
And he said. "Okay.

1018
00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:53.875
Give me some examples

1019
00:27:53.915 --> 00:27:54.980
of your lack of patience."

1020
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:55.980
And I said. "Okay. fine."

1021
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.980
I was at a table like this.

1022
00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:58.453
probably a little bigger.

1023
00:27:58.493 --> 00:27:58.980
with three of my girlfriends

1024
00:27:59.020 --> 00:27:59.958
before my session

1025
00:27:59.998 --> 00:28:00.980
that day with Dan.

1026
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.097
My girlfriend orders

1027
00:28:02.137 --> 00:28:02.980
a turkey burger.

1028
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.875
no onion. no bun.

1029
00:28:04.915 --> 00:28:05.980
no cheese.

1030
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:06.906
That's fine.

1031
00:28:06.946 --> 00:28:07.980
We live in LA.

1032
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.980
[groans]

1033
00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:11.623
So the server comes over

1034
00:28:11.663 --> 00:28:12.980
with his hands full.

1035
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.081
with four plates.

1036
00:28:14.121 --> 00:28:14.980
and comes over

1037
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:15.798
and we're all

1038
00:28:15.838 --> 00:28:16.980
sitting at a table.

1039
00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:17.980
We're not even talking.

1040
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:18.873
And he says.

1041
00:28:18.913 --> 00:28:19.980
"Turkey burger?

1042
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.018
Who ordered the turkey burger.

1043
00:28:22.058 --> 00:28:23.980
no onion. no bun. no cheese?"

1044
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:24.750
And my friend

1045
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:25.980
is just sitting there

1046
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.485
like Stevie Wonder

1047
00:28:27.525 --> 00:28:29.000
playing the piano.

1048
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.980
And he says it again. louder.

1049
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.007
"Turkey burger.

1050
00:28:41.047 --> 00:28:42.980
No onion. no bun. no cheese."

1051
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.000
And this is her.

1052
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.980
I go. "Hey. you fucking cunt!

1053
00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:50.980
"Wake up!

1054
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.980
"Is that your turkey burger?

1055
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.466
You can't order that and then

1056
00:28:55.506 --> 00:28:56.980
forget that you ordered that."

1057
00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.980
[growls]

1058
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.683
I said.

1059
00:29:00.723 --> 00:29:02.980
"So that's one example.

1060
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:03.887
Would you like

1061
00:29:03.927 --> 00:29:04.980
to hear another?"

1062
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.980
He said. "Yes. please go on."

1063
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.988
I said. "Airports. airports.

1064
00:29:08.028 --> 00:29:08.980
I can't deal with the people

1065

"that work

"What's wrong

1068
00:29:11.865 --> 00:29:12.980
with those people?

1069
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.771
"What's up with the slowness

00:29:14.811 --> 00:29:15.980

are they koala bears?"

1077
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.352
He said. "Well. how do you

1078
00:29:28.392 --> 00:29:28.980
handle that?

1079
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.794
I go. "I have to shoplift.

I have to."

1081
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.277
I said. "I get the book.

1082
00:29:36.317 --> 00:29:36.980

1091
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.283

1101
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.000
and then I skedaddle.

1102
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.764
And Dan was looking at me

1103
00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:07.980
when I said that.

1104
00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.133
I was like. "What?

1105
00:30:09.173 --> 00:30:10.980
Is that white privilege too?"

1106
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:11.980
He's like. "No. Chelsea.

1107
00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.571

even doing that."

1109
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.609
I told him.

1110
00:30:16.649 --> 00:30:17.980
anything hotel related--

1111
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.080
I'm like. "I spend tons

"and I get home at. like.

and that's too slow."

1120
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:28.498
At 1:30 in the morning.

1121
00:30:28.538 --> 00:30:28.980
there should be. like.

1122
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.980
a double speed. you know.

1123
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:31.600
where people

1124
00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.980
are quicker and more alert.

1125
00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.980
or--or just quicker.

1126
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.518
Then they wanna repeat

1127
00:30:36.558 --> 00:30:37.980
the order back to me.

1128
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.745
It's like. please.

1129
00:30:38.785 --> 00:30:40.525
whatever you think you heard.

1130
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.980
just bring double.

1131
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.338
And don't say "chicken fingers"

1132
00:30:44.378 --> 00:30:44.980
out loud again.

1133
00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.980
I'm 45 years old.

1134
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:47.703
I don't wanna

1135
00:30:47.743 --> 00:30:48.980
have this conversation.

1136
00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:49.326
Do you know

1137
00:30:49.366 --> 00:30:49.980
how humiliating it is

1138
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.346
to call you in the first place

1139
00:30:51.386 --> 00:30:51.980
and order this

1140
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.400
at 1:30 in the morning?

1141
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.765
And now you wanna go over it

1142
00:30:55.805 --> 00:30:56.980
and shame me again?

1143
00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:57.980
Just bring them.

1144
00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:58.655
And then they bring them

1145
00:30:58.695 --> 00:30:58.980
and that's--

1146
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.678
that's a whole episode

1147
00:31:00.718 --> 00:31:01.980
in and of itself.

1148
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.424
It's like. with the cart

1149
00:31:03.464 --> 00:31:04.980
and the fork and the knife

1150
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:05.933
and they set me up

1151
00:31:05.973 --> 00:31:06.980
like I'm fine dining

1152
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.360
at 2:00 in the morning

1153
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.980
with some chicken fingers.

1154
00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:10.862
As if I'm going to use

1155
00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:11.980
a fork and a knife to cut up

1156
00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:12.980
my chicken fingers.

1157
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.253
You could throw them at me

1158
00:31:14.293 --> 00:31:14.980
across the room

1159
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.892
and I will

1160
00:31:15.932 --> 00:31:18.000
catch them in my mouth.

1161
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.065
And then I have to pretend

1162
00:31:24.105 --> 00:31:24.980
I have a fake daughter

1163
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:25.980
that's. you know. in the bath.

1164
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:26.987
I'm like. "My daughter's

1165
00:31:27.027 --> 00:31:27.980
getting out of the bath.

1166
00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.980
"Can you wrap this up. please?

1167
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.980
Get the fuck out of here."

1168
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.488
I said. "I could get annoyed

1169
00:31:34.528 --> 00:31:35.980
during a hotel massage. Dan.

1170
00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.880
That's the kind of bitch I am."

1171
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.559
The way they talk to you after

1172
00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:42.980
a 45-minute Swedish massage

1173
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.980
is ridiculous.

1174
00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.820
[voice wavering] "You're gonna

1175
00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.980
wanna be careful...

1176
00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.980
getting up."

1177
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.980
Why?

1178
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.980
What? Did you amputate my legs?

1179
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.012
Why do I need

1180
00:31:57.052 --> 00:31:58.980
to be careful getting up?

1181
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.279
This is supposed to be

1182
00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:02.059
more relaxing. not stressful.

1183
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.111
And then they hand you

1184
00:32:05.151 --> 00:32:05.980
a gross Dixie cup

1185
00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.980
of room-temperature water.

1186
00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:09.902
It's like. "Ugh.

1187
00:32:09.942 --> 00:32:11.082
I don't want that."

1188
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.739
[mockingly] "You're gonna wanna

1189
00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:14.980
drink a lot of water."

1190
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.533
No. I won't.

1191
00:32:16.573 --> 00:32:18.980
Fuckin' hate water.

1192
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.810
The only thing

1193
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:20.980
more offensive to me

1194
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:21.980
than room-temperature water

1195
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.072
is room-temperature

1196
00:32:23.112 --> 00:32:23.980
sparkling water.

1197
00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.284
That is like.

1198
00:32:25.324 --> 00:32:27.980
"Fuck you and your family."

1199
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.508
So I said.

1200
00:32:28.548 --> 00:32:29.980
"So what do you think I have

1201
00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:30.980
after all of this?"

1202
00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.389
I said. "What do you think

1203
00:32:32.429 --> 00:32:32.980
it is. Dan?

1204
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.235
What? ADD?

1205
00:32:34.275 --> 00:32:34.980
What?"

1206
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.652
He said...

1207
00:32:36.692 --> 00:32:38.000
[laughs]

1208
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.847
"I don't know

1209
00:32:40.887 --> 00:32:41.980
if you have ADD."

1210
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.193
He's like. "I have no idea

1211
00:32:43.233 --> 00:32:43.980
if you have that.

1212
00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.341
You could take

1213
00:32:45.381 --> 00:32:46.980
a test for that."

1214
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:47.980
It's like. great.

1215
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:48.735
He said.

1216
00:32:48.775 --> 00:32:50.980
"It's eight hours long."

1217
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:52.002
I was like. "Well. let's just

1218
00:32:52.042 --> 00:32:52.980
operate under the assumption

1219
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.980
that I have it."

1220
00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.415
He said. "I think

1221
00:32:57.455 --> 00:32:59.980
you lack empathy."

1222
00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.407
I was like.

1223
00:33:01.447 --> 00:33:04.000
"Like a Republican?"

1224
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.876
And I had him draw

1225
00:33:06.916 --> 00:33:07.980
the distinction for me

1226
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:09.700
between sympathy and empathy

1227
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.980
because I couldn't remember.

1228
00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:11.422
I said.

1229
00:33:11.462 --> 00:33:12.980
"Wait. sympathy is what?"

1230
00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:13.946
He said. "Sympathy is when

1231
00:33:13.986 --> 00:33:14.980
you feel sorry for somebody.

1232
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.144
"or you feel badly

1233
00:33:16.184 --> 00:33:16.980
for somebody.

1234
00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:17.433
Somebody's going through

1235
00:33:17.473 --> 00:33:17.980
a bad time and you help them."

1236
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.980
I said. "Oh. I've got that."

1237
00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:20.680
I would do that

1238
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.980
for any of you sitting here.

1239
00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.095
I would do that for strangers.

1240
00:33:23.135 --> 00:33:23.980
Yeah. I've got sympathy.

1241
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.378
He said. "Empathy is

1242
00:33:25.418 --> 00:33:26.980
actually thinking about

1243
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:27.920
"what it's like

1244
00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.980
to be that person

1245
00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.063
"that's going through

1246
00:33:30.103 --> 00:33:30.980
a difficult time--

1247
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:31.620
"actually thinking about

1248
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:31.980
what it's like

1249
00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.340
"to be in their shoes.

1250
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.980
Have you ever done that?"

1251
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.980
I was like. "Oh. no."

1252
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.527
I was like. "That's depressing.

1253
00:33:40.567 --> 00:33:41.000
No."

1254
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:42.836
He said. "You need

1255
00:33:42.876 --> 00:33:43.980
to think about the woman

1256
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:44.367
"that's working at

1257
00:33:44.407 --> 00:33:44.980
the Hudson Booksellers store.

1258
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:45.943
"You need to think about

1259
00:33:45.983 --> 00:33:46.980
the fact that she may have

1260
00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:47.886
"more than one job.

1261
00:33:47.926 --> 00:33:48.980
or that she has to deal

1262
00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.219
"with people like you

1263
00:33:50.259 --> 00:33:51.039
all day long.

1264
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:52.630
"You have to think about

1265
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:52.980
the fact that

1266
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.980
she's got a family at home."

1267
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:54.666
And I'm like...

1268
00:33:54.706 --> 00:33:54.980
[sighs]

1269
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.452
"I have to think about

1270
00:33:56.492 --> 00:33:58.000
all those koala bears?"

1271
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.953
But it made sense.

1272
00:34:01.993 --> 00:34:02.980
and I was clicking.

1273
00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.334
It was like. oh. wait.

1274
00:34:04.374 --> 00:34:05.980
paying somebody to tell you

1275
00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:06.464
what's wrong with you

1276
00:34:06.504 --> 00:34:06.980
is a great transaction.

1277
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.279
I was like. no friends

1278
00:34:08.319 --> 00:34:09.980
are gonna tell you. you know.

1279
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:10.743
I was like.

1280
00:34:10.783 --> 00:34:11.980
"Oh. okay. great."

1281
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:12.275
I'm like.

1282
00:34:12.315 --> 00:34:12.980
"How do I get empathy?

1283
00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.438
Is there an app

1284
00:34:14.478 --> 00:34:15.980
I can download?"

1285
00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.387
And he said. "Can you think

1286
00:34:18.427 --> 00:34:19.980
of any experiences

1287
00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.943
that you've had recently

1288
00:34:20.983 --> 00:34:21.980
where you lacked empathy?"

1289
00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.980
I was like. "Um. yeah."

1290
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:24.470
And all of a sudden.

1291
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.770
all these light bulbs

1292
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.980
went on in my head.

1293
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:27.902
and I remembered

1294
00:34:27.942 --> 00:34:28.980
going to this movie

1295
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.980
with one of my gay friends.

1296
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:31.345
It was called

1297
00:34:31.385 --> 00:34:31.980
"Call Me By Your Name."

1298
00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.044
It came out. like.

1299
00:34:33.084 --> 00:34:33.980
three years ago.

1300
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:34.827
And I didn't know what

1301
00:34:34.867 --> 00:34:36.667
the movie was when we went in.

1302
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.980
but five minutes in. I did.

1303
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.083
And I was like. "Whoa. whoa.

1304
00:34:40.123 --> 00:34:40.980
whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

1305
00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.980
What is this?"

1306
00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.561
I go. "What is this?

1307
00:34:44.601 --> 00:34:45.980
A gay love story?"

1308
00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:46.611
He goes. "Yeah.

1309
00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:46.980
Shut up."

1310
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.000
I go. "You're so selfish."

1311
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.707
And Dan looked at me;

1312
00:34:51.747 --> 00:34:52.247
he said.

1313
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.980
"Do you know why that's wrong?"

1314
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.980
I go. "I think so.

1315
00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:57.301
"'Cause gay people have had

1316
00:34:57.341 --> 00:34:57.980
to sit through

1317
00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:58.980
"straight people's love stories

1318
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.571
since the beginning

1319
00:35:00.611 --> 00:35:01.980
of fucking time."

1320
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.220
And he goes. "Yeah."

1321
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.930
So now at my house.

1322
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:05.980
all I have on a loop.

1323
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.487
all day long

1324
00:35:07.527 --> 00:35:09.000
is gay porn.

1325
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Out of respect.

1326
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.945
Finding out I lacked empathy

1327
00:35:17.985 --> 00:35:20.000
was. like. a huge light bulb.

1328
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.980
and I was so excited.

1329
00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:22.980
I was on board with therapy.

1330
00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:23.980
and he got me from that.

1331
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.054
I'm like. "You're right.

1332
00:35:25.094 --> 00:35:25.980
I don't have empathy.

1333
00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:26.431
"Okay. let's go.

1334
00:35:26.471 --> 00:35:26.980
let's go. what else?

1335
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:27.563
And he said

1336
00:35:27.603 --> 00:35:28.980
"What about relationships?"

1337
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:29.908
I'm like. "No good.

1338
00:35:29.948 --> 00:35:30.980
I'm not good at that."

1339
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:31.900
He said. "Do you want

1340
00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:32.980
to be in a relationship?"

1341
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.236
I'm like.

1342
00:35:33.276 --> 00:35:33.980
"Whatever you say. I'll do.

1343
00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:34.798
"If you think

1344
00:35:34.838 --> 00:35:35.980
I should be in one.

1345
00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.469
I'll go find somebody."

1346
00:35:37.509 --> 00:35:37.980
[laughs]

1347
00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.000
I said. "But I--

1348
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:40.289
"It's tricky

1349
00:35:40.329 --> 00:35:41.949
'cause everybody annoys me.

1350
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.980
"and men annoy me.

1351
00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:43.614
"Their belts annoy me.

1352
00:35:43.654 --> 00:35:43.980
their shoes--

1353
00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.980
everything about them."

1354
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.334
I said. "But if we're gonna

1355
00:35:47.374 --> 00:35:47.980
do something.

1356
00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:48.372
we should lock

1357
00:35:48.412 --> 00:35:48.980
something down quick."

1358
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.065
I mean. I'm in

1359
00:35:50.105 --> 00:35:51.980
a denim onesie right now.

1360
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:52.744
I have orthotics

1361
00:35:52.784 --> 00:35:53.980
in every pair of my shoes.

1362
00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:54.984
One of my eyes

1363
00:35:55.024 --> 00:35:55.980
is going bald.

1364
00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:56.885
I have to shave my face

1365
00:35:56.925 --> 00:35:57.980
in the shower in the morning

1366
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.593
to get rid of this facial hair

1367
00:35:59.633 --> 00:36:00.980
that I'm starting to grow.

1368
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.230
I used aftershave the other day

1369
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.980
for the first time.

1370
00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.596
Either I'm transitioning

1371
00:36:05.636 --> 00:36:07.980
and I don't know it...

1372
00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.980
or I'm in decline.

1373
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.987
I saw my elbow the other day

1374
00:36:12.027 --> 00:36:12.980
in the mirror.

1375
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:13.362
I was like.

1376
00:36:13.402 --> 00:36:13.980
is that an iguana?

1377
00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:14.467
What is that?

1378
00:36:14.507 --> 00:36:15.347
What happened?

1379
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.324
And why does it look like

1380
00:36:18.364 --> 00:36:18.980
a butt?

1381
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.460
The other day I coughed.

1382
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.385
and liquid came

1383
00:36:22.425 --> 00:36:24.000
out of my vagina.

1384
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
That. I blame on 50 Cent.

1385
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.980
And I went to my doctor.

1386
00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:38.823
and she was. like.

1387
00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:39.980
doing my hormone testing.

1388
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.040
and she's like. "Okay. sweetie.

1389
00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:41.980
You're low on testosterone."

1390
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:42.968
I'm like. "I don't think

1391
00:36:43.008 --> 00:36:43.980
I'm low on testosterone."

1392
00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.194
I'm like. "I could give a man

1393
00:36:45.234 --> 00:36:45.980
some testosterone."

1394
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:46.561
I'm like.

1395
00:36:46.601 --> 00:36:47.980
"I'm very aggressive."

1396
00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:48.877
She's like.

1397
00:36:48.917 --> 00:36:50.980
"That's not testosterone."

1398
00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:51.414
So she said.

1399
00:36:51.454 --> 00:36:52.414
"You have none."

1400
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:53.314
And she said.

1401
00:36:53.354 --> 00:36:53.980
"It's just better that you

1402
00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:54.820
replace your hormones

1403
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.980
when you start to lose them."

1404
00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.944
And I'm like...

1405
00:36:57.984 --> 00:36:58.980
[groans]

1406
00:36:59.020 --> 00:36:59.735
So I started

1407
00:36:59.775 --> 00:37:00.980
taking testosterone.

1408
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:01.825
which is. you know.

1409
00:37:01.865 --> 00:37:02.980
some cream you have to rub

1410
00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:03.340
on your leg

1411
00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.580
like an older woman.

1412
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:05.689
And I was like. okay. well.

1413
00:37:05.729 --> 00:37:05.980
here we go.

1414
00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.803
I'm just heading

1415
00:37:06.843 --> 00:37:07.980
into elderly territory.

1416
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:09.443
And then I go back

1417
00:37:09.483 --> 00:37:10.980
to the same doctor.

1418
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.173
like. two months later

1419
00:37:12.213 --> 00:37:12.980
and I was like.

1420
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:13.784
"My hair

1421
00:37:13.824 --> 00:37:15.980
is really thin on top.

1422
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:16.431
Do you know what

1423
00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:16.980
that could be from?"

1424
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.863
And she's like. "Well.

1425
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:21.000
are you on testosterone?"

1426
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.597
I'm like "Yeah--yeah. bitch.

1427
00:37:25.637 --> 00:37:27.077
you prescribed it to me.

1428
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.584
"Don't you remember?

1429
00:37:28.624 --> 00:37:28.980
What are you?

1430
00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.126
A vet?

1431
00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:33.000
Are you a vet?"

1432
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.389
And I said. "What

1433
00:37:34.429 --> 00:37:34.980
are the side effects of--

1434
00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.180
I mean. what is testosterone

1435
00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:36.980
even doing for me?"

1436
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.709
I mean. I don't want--

1437
00:37:38.749 --> 00:37:40.980
I don't want to lose my hair.

1438
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.546
And one of my eyelashes--

1439
00:37:42.586 --> 00:37:42.980
I mean.

1440
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:43.951
one of my eyes

1441
00:37:43.991 --> 00:37:44.980
is almost bald.

1442
00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.064
I have two eyelashes

1443
00:37:46.104 --> 00:37:46.980
that have come in

1444
00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:47.980
over the past two years.

1445
00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.980
Like. none will sprout.

1446
00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.185
And she says. "Well.

1447
00:37:52.225 --> 00:37:53.980
it helps with your sex drive."

1448
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.110
I'm like. "So you want me

1449
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.000
to be bald and horny?"

1450
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.980
And then what?

1451
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.273
What's the game plan

1452
00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:02.980
after that?

1453
00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.254
Just play solitaire

1454
00:38:04.294 --> 00:38:06.000
all by myself every night?

1455
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.980
The thing is. I like older men.

1456
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.171
When I was 20. that was fine.

1457
00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:16.980
'cause they were 40.

1458
00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:17.760
When I was 30.

1459
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:18.980
I dated a 50-year-old.

1460
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.153
When I was 35.

1461
00:38:20.193 --> 00:38:21.980
I dated a 55-year-old.

1462
00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:22.980
I'm 45.

1463
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.043
I'm not down

1464
00:38:24.083 --> 00:38:26.000
to fuck a 65-year-old.

1465
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.513
Okay. that margin

1466
00:38:27.553 --> 00:38:27.980
needs to close.

1467
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.174
I'm all for 65-year-olds.

1468
00:38:29.214 --> 00:38:29.980
and I'll fuck you

1469
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:30.980
when I get to be your age.

1470
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.111
But not now.

1471
00:38:32.151 --> 00:38:33.980
It's--it's too much.

1472
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.980
There is an age where men

1473
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.919
either start to look

1474
00:38:38.959 --> 00:38:39.980
like women.

1475
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.980
or they get the slippery lips.

1476
00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.929
where their mouths

1477
00:38:43.969 --> 00:38:45.980
turn into Jacuzzis.

1478
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.980
And that's when I skedaddled.

1479
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.172
Which brings me to the strong

1480
00:38:51.212 --> 00:38:52.980
and deep sexual feelings

1481
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.197
that I have developed

1482
00:38:55.237 --> 00:38:57.000
for Andrew Cuomo.

1483
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.800
I mean. I know we all feel it.

1484
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:02.980
A lot of women are feeling it.

1485
00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:03.638
When he came on the scene.

1486
00:39:03.678 --> 00:39:03.980
he looked like

1487
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.980
the Incredible Hulk also.

1488
00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:06.514
You know.

1489
00:39:06.554 --> 00:39:07.980
that big Italian gorilla.

1490
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:08.327
It's like.

1491
00:39:08.367 --> 00:39:08.980
"Put on your mask."

1492
00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:09.251
I'm like.

1493
00:39:09.291 --> 00:39:10.791
"Oh. I'll put my mask on.

1494
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.844
Oh yeah. I will.

1495
00:39:11.884 --> 00:39:12.980
I'll put on my mask."

1496
00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:13.987
He's the kind of asshole

1497
00:39:14.027 --> 00:39:14.980
that I will do shit for.

1498
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.760
And you know he's an asshole.

1499
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:17.670
and that's what I like

1500
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.980
about him.

1501
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:18.980
Like. an old-fashioned asshole.

1502
00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.604
somebody who's gonna tell me

1503
00:39:20.644 --> 00:39:21.980
to sit down and shut up.

1504
00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:22.980
I want him to flatten my curve

1505
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.395
and then I wanna

1506
00:39:24.435 --> 00:39:25.980
flatten his curve.

1507
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.042
And then I want us

1508
00:39:28.082 --> 00:39:29.980
to apex together.

1509
00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.433
And he can mansplain to me

1510
00:39:31.473 --> 00:39:32.980
all night long about fishing

1511
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:33.916
or motorcycles

1512
00:39:33.956 --> 00:39:35.980
or whatever dumb shit he's into

1513
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:36.545
that I will pretend

1514
00:39:36.585 --> 00:39:37.485
that I am into.

1515
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.226
because that's how down

1516
00:39:39.266 --> 00:39:39.980
I am with him.

1517
00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.165
Guess who's not jerking

1518
00:39:41.205 --> 00:39:41.980
off into plants?

1519
00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:46.000
Andrew Cuomo.

1520
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.980
I want him to govern me...

1521
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.980
multiple times.

1522
00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:54.959
I imagine us spending

1523
00:39:54.999 --> 00:39:55.980
long weekends together

1524
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:57.980
in the Adirondacks.

1525
00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.980
playing games of "Clue."

1526
00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:00.405
a game I thought

1527
00:40:00.445 --> 00:40:01.765
I had already mastered

1528
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.297
that he's teaching me

1529
00:40:03.337 --> 00:40:04.980
entirely new strategies to.

1530
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:05.980
I imagine him getting very sick

1531
00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:06.798
and me having

1532
00:40:06.838 --> 00:40:07.980
the only medication

1533
00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.980
that can make him better.

1534
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.000
Two doxycycline...

1535
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.980
twice a day for ten days.

1536
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.980
Never on an empty stomach.

1537
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:17.902
I would keep him

1538
00:40:17.942 --> 00:40:18.980
slightly dehydrated

1539
00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.804
so wouldn't get

1540
00:40:20.844 --> 00:40:22.980
the slippery lips.

1541
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.598
Because he's got them.

1542
00:40:23.638 --> 00:40:23.980
He's got them.

1543
00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.576
He's on the cusp of exactly

1544
00:40:25.616 --> 00:40:26.980
what I'm talking about--

1545
00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.054
that big mouth.

1546
00:40:28.094 --> 00:40:28.980
and it's wet.

1547
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.536
and in two more years.

1548
00:40:29.576 --> 00:40:29.980
he's gonna be able

1549
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.562
to swallow me

1550
00:40:31.602 --> 00:40:33.980
like a meatball sub.

1551
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.049
But I need to get

1552
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.980
in there quick.

1553
00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.085
because once the curve

1554
00:40:37.125 --> 00:40:37.980
flattens for good.

1555
00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.000
so will my crush.

1556
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.098
I told Dan that I mostly

1557
00:40:43.138 --> 00:40:43.980
hook up on vacation

1558
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:44.980
when I travel internationally.

1559
00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.036
'cause there's always

1560
00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:46.980
a language barrier.

1561
00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:47.887
and that works

1562
00:40:47.927 --> 00:40:48.980
to my advantage--

1563
00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:49.929
when people can't really

1564
00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:50.980
understand what I'm saying.

1565
00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.980
We went on a scuba diving trip

1566
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.336
with my girlfriend

1567
00:40:54.376 --> 00:40:55.980
for her 40th birthday.

1568
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.434
And we all had

1569
00:40:56.474 --> 00:40:56.980
to get certified.

1570
00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:57.980
and I'm not really good

1571
00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:58.980
in a classroom setting.

1572
00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.980
So I wasn't paying attention.

1573
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.023
and they were like. okay.

1574
00:41:02.063 --> 00:41:02.980
everyone needs a buddy.

1575
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:03.633
I'm like. "I don't want to be

1576
00:41:03.673 --> 00:41:03.980
anybody's buddy.

1577
00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.662
"I-I'm not gonna help anybody

1578
00:41:05.702 --> 00:41:06.980
with their oxygen tank.

1579
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:07.987
Like. everyone's--I can't--

1580
00:41:08.027 --> 00:41:08.980
I'm not the girl for that."

1581
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.144
So my cousin Molly

1582
00:41:10.184 --> 00:41:10.980
was my buddy.

1583
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:11.468
I'm like.

1584
00:41:11.508 --> 00:41:12.980
"But I'm not gonna save you.

1585
00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:13.980
"so. like. we should split up.

1586
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.010
and I should go with

1587
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.980
one of the guides."

1588
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.980
They had two divemasters.

1589
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.249
And we're in French Polynesia.

1590
00:41:20.289 --> 00:41:21.980
and we're shark diving.

1591
00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:22.500
And I don't know

1592
00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:22.980
what I'm doing.

1593
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.486
I'm just like. I can't

1594
00:41:24.526 --> 00:41:25.980
get my mask on normal.

1595
00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:26.672
And I'm already underwater

1596
00:41:26.712 --> 00:41:26.980
and shit is.

1597
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:27.953
like. messed up

1598
00:41:27.993 --> 00:41:28.980
all of a sudden.

1599
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:29.720
I'm. like. trying

1600
00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.980
to tie my sneaker underwater.

1601
00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.771
You know. that's the kind of

1602
00:41:32.811 --> 00:41:33.980
situation I was in.

1603
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.980
And she pulls on my leg.

1604
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:37.989
And I freak out.

1605
00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:38.980
and I look down.

1606
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.011
and there's this huge

1607
00:41:40.051 --> 00:41:40.980
blacktip reef shark.

1608
00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.717
and underwater. you can't tell

1609
00:41:42.757 --> 00:41:43.980
if it's five feet away

1610
00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:44.980
or 20 feet away.

1611
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.980
So I go to kick it immediately.

1612
00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:47.916
And I go back.

1613
00:41:47.956 --> 00:41:49.980
'cause I have my scuba tank on.

1614
00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:50.987
and my goggles

1615
00:41:51.027 --> 00:41:52.980
fill up with all this water.

1616
00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.980
and I can't see anything.

1617
00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.352
So I'm just sitting there.

1618
00:41:56.392 --> 00:41:57.980
waiting to be eaten by a shark.

1619
00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:58.980
and I can't see.

1620
00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.010
And you can't ascend

1621
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.980
when you scuba dive

1622
00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.134
'cause you could hurt yourself

1623
00:42:02.174 --> 00:42:02.980
and your equilibrium--

1624
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:03.980
you can screw that up.

1625
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.980
So I'm just panicking

1626
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:06.836
and having. I think.

1627
00:42:06.876 --> 00:42:07.980
my very first panic attack.

1628
00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:08.922
I don't know what else

1629
00:42:08.962 --> 00:42:09.980
you could describe it as.

1630
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.520
And I'm like. "Uhh. uhh!"

1631
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:12.425
And all of a sudden.

1632
00:42:12.465 --> 00:42:12.980
my divemaster comes down.

1633
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.312
smashes my mask against

1634
00:42:14.352 --> 00:42:15.980
my face. looks me in the eye.

1635
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:16.826
and he's like...

1636
00:42:16.866 --> 00:42:17.980
[breathing] "Breathe."

1637
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:18.730
And then he holds my hand.

1638
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:18.980
I'm like.

1639
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.000
"Oh. I'm gonna fuck you.

1640
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.173
"I'm gonna--as soon as

1641
00:42:25.213 --> 00:42:25.980
we get to land.

1642
00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:26.415
"I'm gonna fuck

1643
00:42:26.455 --> 00:42:26.980
the shit out of you.

1644
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.880
"This the hottest rescue

1645
00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:29.980
I've ever had.

1646
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.303
Oh. my God. I love

1647
00:42:31.343 --> 00:42:32.980
a man in charge of me."

1648
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:33.843
And then we did

1649
00:42:33.883 --> 00:42:34.980
the rest of our dive

1650
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:35.983
holding hands

1651
00:42:36.023 --> 00:42:37.980
like an underwater couple.

1652
00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:38.980
I've never been so happy.

1653
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.894
My friends were

1654
00:42:39.934 --> 00:42:40.980
all looking at me.

1655
00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.564
giving me the finger

1656
00:42:43.604 --> 00:42:44.980
underwater.

1657
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.173
Then we got to the top

1658
00:42:46.213 --> 00:42:46.980
after our dive.

1659
00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.095
and we got in the little boat.

1660
00:42:48.135 --> 00:42:48.980
and he took his mask off

1661
00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.233
and I was like.

1662
00:42:50.273 --> 00:42:51.980
"Oh. whoopsie doodle.

1663
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.985
You're gonna wanna

1664
00:42:54.025 --> 00:42:55.980
put that back on."

1665
00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:56.469
I was skiing in

1666
00:42:56.509 --> 00:42:56.980
Switzerland once

1667
00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.915
and I wiped out really badly

1668
00:42:58.955 --> 00:43:00.980
and I ended up tearing my ACL.

1669
00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:01.677
And so I'm. like. tumbling down

1670
00:43:01.717 --> 00:43:02.557
this mountain.

1671
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.870
I was skiing

1672
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:04.980
out of control.

1673
00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.980
and I paid the price for it.

1674
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:07.752
And I--as I'm crashing.

1675
00:43:07.792 --> 00:43:07.980
I hear.

1676
00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:08.588
click. click. click.

1677
00:43:08.628 --> 00:43:08.980
click. click.

1678
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.156
And I'm like. oh my God.

1679
00:43:10.196 --> 00:43:10.980
my legs are gone.

1680
00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:11.541
You know. like.

1681
00:43:11.581 --> 00:43:11.980
I'll just be

1682
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.208
a floating neck

1683
00:43:14.248 --> 00:43:15.980
when I stop.

1684
00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.261
And I stopped. finally.

1685
00:43:17.301 --> 00:43:17.980
and I look up

1686
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.980
at my Austrian ski guide.

1687
00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:20.415
and he's. like.

1688
00:43:20.455 --> 00:43:20.980
smoking a cigarette.

1689
00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:21.987
He's like... [in accent]

1690
00:43:22.027 --> 00:43:22.980
"You just tore your ACL.

1691
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.980
Helicopter is coming."

1692
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.698
I was like. "Helicopter?

1693
00:43:26.738 --> 00:43:27.980
This is exciting."

1694
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.517
And a helicopter came in.

1695
00:43:29.557 --> 00:43:30.980
we're in the Swiss Alps.

1696
00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:31.909
and my three girlfriends

1697
00:43:31.949 --> 00:43:32.980
are just staring at me like.

1698
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.980
"Again?"

1699
00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.599
And they come down.

1700
00:43:36.639 --> 00:43:38.980
and these two medics run out

1701
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:39.885
and they run over to me

1702
00:43:39.925 --> 00:43:40.980
and I'm lying on the ground.

1703
00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.049
And they're like.

1704
00:43:42.089 --> 00:43:42.980
"Are you okay?"

1705
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.514
And I'm trying to be tough.

1706
00:43:44.554 --> 00:43:45.980
I'm like. "Yes. I'm okay."

1707
00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:46.404
They're like.

1708
00:43:46.444 --> 00:43:46.980
"Are you in pain?"

1709
00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:47.980
I'm like. "Nope."

1710
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:48.535
And they're like.

1711
00:43:48.575 --> 00:43:48.980
"No morphine?"

1712
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:52.000
I'm like. "I'm in pain!"

1713
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.863
And then they whisk me away

1714
00:43:56.903 --> 00:43:57.980
on the stretcher

1715
00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.341
back to the helicopter.

1716
00:43:59.381 --> 00:44:00.980
and I get in the helicopter.

1717
00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:01.836
The wind is blowing;

1718
00:44:01.876 --> 00:44:02.980
the propellers are blowing;

1719
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:03.980
there's snow everywhere.

1720
00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.980
It was so romantic.

1721
00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:07.961
And I get in. and there's

1722
00:44:08.001 --> 00:44:08.980
two pilots and two medics.

1723
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.201
I'm like. I'm gonna

1724
00:44:10.241 --> 00:44:11.980
fuck all four of these guys.

1725
00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.025
I'm like. this is gonna be

1726
00:44:13.065 --> 00:44:13.980
like a reverse gangbang.

1727
00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.980
Look at me.

1728
00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.248
So turned on.

1729
00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:20.980
so turned on by that rescue.

1730
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.758
I was like...

1731
00:44:22.798 --> 00:44:23.980
[moaning]

1732
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.916
But it was a 45-minute ride

1733
00:44:25.956 --> 00:44:26.980
to the hospital

1734
00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:27.931
and they had

1735
00:44:27.971 --> 00:44:29.980
these thick German accents

1736
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:30.484
and I'm a Jew.

1737
00:44:30.524 --> 00:44:30.980
so I was like.

1738
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.297
well. I'm not fuckin'

1739
00:44:32.337 --> 00:44:32.980
these guys.

1740
00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:34.723
Not giving these Nazis

1741
00:44:34.763 --> 00:44:35.980
another victory.

1742
00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.697
I'll take one of you.

1743
00:44:37.737 --> 00:44:40.000
but not all four. not today.

1744
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.035
And when I finished

1745
00:44:43.075 --> 00:44:43.980
telling Dan that.

1746
00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:44.672
he was looking at me funny

1747
00:44:44.712 --> 00:44:44.980
and he said.

1748
00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.517
"You know. I really think

1749
00:44:46.557 --> 00:44:47.980
you need to settle down.

1750
00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.113
"You need to stop.

1751
00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:50.980
You're moving very. very fast.

1752
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:51.980
"And it seems to me

1753
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.232
that you could benefit a lot

1754
00:44:53.272 --> 00:44:53.980
from meditation."

1755
00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.347
And I was like...

1756
00:44:55.387 --> 00:44:55.980
[groans]

1757
00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.280
Meditation. to me. sounded like

1758
00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.980
room-temperature water.

1759
00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.004
And he said. "I want you

1760
00:45:01.044 --> 00:45:02.424
to commit to meditation

1761
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:03.980
for three months."

1762
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:04.980
And I was like. "Three months?

1763
00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:08.000
That's like a pregnancy."

1764
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.270
And he was like. "Eh.

1765
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:14.980
that's nine months. Chelsea.

1766
00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.122
Pregnancy is nine months.

1767
00:45:16.162 --> 00:45:16.980
and you know that."

1768
00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.283
I go. "You know what. Dan.

1769
00:45:18.323 --> 00:45:18.980
some are nine.

1770
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:19.980
"some are three. some are one.

1771
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.233
Don't even get me started.

1772
00:45:23.273 --> 00:45:24.000
okay."

1773
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.559
And then cannabis became legal

1774
00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:28.980
in the state of California.

1775
00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.772
And there was all of this

1776
00:45:30.812 --> 00:45:32.980
education that has been missing

1777
00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.205
for all of these years

1778
00:45:34.245 --> 00:45:34.980
with cannabis.

1779
00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:35.354
You no longer had

1780
00:45:35.394 --> 00:45:36.960
to take a cookie and find out

1781
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.165
you were on a transcontinental

1782
00:45:39.205 --> 00:45:40.980
flight seven hours later.

1783
00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.963
Cannabis became my gateway drug

1784
00:45:43.003 --> 00:45:43.980
into meditating.

1785
00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:44.380
It allowed me

1786
00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:44.980
to. like. slow down.

1787
00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:47.129
It was cannabis and meditation

1788
00:45:47.169 --> 00:45:47.980
and therapy.

1789
00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:48.485
And it was working.

1790
00:45:48.525 --> 00:45:49.665
I was slowing down.

1791
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.071
And I was thinking

1792
00:45:51.111 --> 00:45:51.980
before I spoke.

1793
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.283
which. before I met Dan.

1794
00:45:53.323 --> 00:45:53.980
was something

1795
00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.980
that never even occurred to me.

1796
00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:56.791
And with microdosing.

1797
00:45:56.831 --> 00:45:57.980
you know. you could take. like.

1798
00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.158
2 1/2 milligrams.

1799
00:45:59.198 --> 00:45:59.980
1 milligram.

1800
00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:00.760
5 milligrams--

1801
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.980
you take a blueberry--

1802
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.122
you're never gonna be

1803
00:46:03.162 --> 00:46:03.980
off your rocker.

1804
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:04.980
It just sanded down the edges.

1805
00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.366
and I stopped watching the news

1806
00:46:06.406 --> 00:46:06.980
24 hours a day

1807
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.022
and I stopped being so angry

1808
00:46:09.062 --> 00:46:10.980
at Donald Trump and Ivanka.

1809
00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.349
You know. I was able

1810
00:46:12.389 --> 00:46:13.980
to focus on other things

1811
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.010
and I was able to be

1812
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.980
happier and lighter

1813
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.738
and I started drinking less.

1814
00:46:17.778 --> 00:46:18.980
which was a sentence

1815
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.770
that I thought would never ever

1816
00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:21.980
come out of my mouth.

1817
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:22.986
And I was so excited

1818
00:46:23.026 --> 00:46:23.980
because now cannabis

1819
00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.533
can be a drug that you control.

1820
00:46:25.573 --> 00:46:26.980
not a drug that controls you.

1821
00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:28.360
So I was excited about

1822
00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.980
the prospects of cannabis.

1823
00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:30.980
not only in my life.

1824
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.485
but all my friends'

1825
00:46:32.525 --> 00:46:33.980
and family's lives.

1826
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:34.968
All the people I've been

1827
00:46:35.008 --> 00:46:35.980
prescribing medication to

1828
00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:38.258
were now getting cannabis

1829
00:46:38.298 --> 00:46:38.980
instead.

1830
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:39.706
Anybody who had trouble

1831
00:46:39.746 --> 00:46:40.286
sleeping.

1832
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:41.980
I'm like. try this gummy.

1833
00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:42.943
Anybody who had anxiety.

1834
00:46:42.983 --> 00:46:43.980
I'm like. try this edible.

1835
00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.341
try this mint. try this

1836
00:46:45.381 --> 00:46:46.980
chocolate-covered blueberry.

1837
00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:47.810
It was helping

1838
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:48.980
all sorts of people.

1839
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.103
and I was doing research

1840
00:46:50.143 --> 00:46:50.980
and collecting data

1841
00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:52.520
and I was keeping notes

1842
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.000
in my medical journal.

1843
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.030
The best part. I think.

1844
00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:56.980
about edibles is that

1845
00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.149
you take a little edible.

1846
00:46:58.189 --> 00:46:58.980
and then sometimes

1847
00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.980
you forget you've taken one.

1848
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.042
and then. like. 45 minutes

1849
00:47:02.082 --> 00:47:03.462
later. you're like. mm.

1850
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.540
everything's a little bit

1851
00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.980
more sparkly. you know?

1852
00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.027
Everybody's a little bit

1853
00:47:08.067 --> 00:47:08.980
less fuckin' annoying.

1854
00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.510
and you're like. yeah. I could

1855
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:11.980
talk to you for another hour.

1856
00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.646
So my family came out

1857
00:47:13.686 --> 00:47:14.980
to visit me in LA

1858
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:15.980
for Thanksgiving.

1859
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:16.843
and my sister's

1860
00:47:16.883 --> 00:47:18.083
a recovering Mormon.

1861
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.081
and I said. "Hey. I want you

1862
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:21.980
to try this.

1863
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:22.554
"Like. I know you don't like

1864
00:47:22.594 --> 00:47:22.980
fun. but do you wanna

1865
00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.094
try this chocolate-covered

1866
00:47:25.134 --> 00:47:25.980
blueberry?"

1867
00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:26.405
I said. "I think

1868
00:47:26.445 --> 00:47:26.980
you're gonna like it."

1869
00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:27.349
And she's like.

1870
00:47:27.389 --> 00:47:27.980
"Yeah. yeah. I'll try it."

1871
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.980
And she loved it.

1872
00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:30.670
She came back into the kitchen

1873
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:31.550
an hour later.

1874
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:32.869
She goes. "Oh. sissy.

1875
00:47:32.909 --> 00:47:33.980
I feel so warm and fuzzy."

1876
00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:35.980
I go. "Isn't it great?"

1877
00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:36.417
And she goes.

1878
00:47:36.457 --> 00:47:36.980
"Oh. my God. yes.

1879
00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:37.818
"This is. like.

1880
00:47:37.858 --> 00:47:38.980
better than drinking.

1881
00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:39.861
This is just--

1882
00:47:39.901 --> 00:47:40.980
I love everybody."

1883
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:41.922
And I'm like. "I know.

1884
00:47:41.962 --> 00:47:42.980
Do you want another one?"

1885
00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.011
She said. "Can I?"

1886
00:47:44.051 --> 00:47:44.980
I go. "Oh. yeah."

1887
00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.341
And I put in my medical

1888
00:47:46.381 --> 00:47:48.061
journal. "She's taking two."

1889
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.092
An hour later. she walked

1890
00:47:54.132 --> 00:47:54.980
into the living room

1891
00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:55.955
from the kitchen

1892
00:47:55.995 --> 00:47:56.980
with a frozen ham

1893
00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.980
underneath her arm.

1894
00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.160
And I'm like. "What--what--

1895
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:01.980
what's that about?"

1896
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:03.412
I'm like. "You wanna

1897
00:48:03.452 --> 00:48:04.980
cook a ham right now?"

1898
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.624
She's like. "No. I just opened

1899
00:48:06.664 --> 00:48:07.980
the freezer and saw this.

1900
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:11.000
and it reminded me of Mom."

1901
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.706
I was like. "Oh. sissy.

1902
00:48:13.746 --> 00:48:14.980
let's go to bed."

1903
00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:15.986
So we went upstairs.

1904
00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:16.980
and we got into bed.

1905
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:17.841
I took the frozen ham

1906
00:48:17.881 --> 00:48:18.980
and I threw it in the sauna.

1907
00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.032
I was like. this will be ready

1908
00:48:21.072 --> 00:48:22.000
at some point.

1909
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.443
And we got into bed.

1910
00:48:24.483 --> 00:48:25.863
and we were just. like.

1911
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.143
snuggling and cuddling

1912
00:48:27.183 --> 00:48:27.980
like sisters do.

1913
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.038
and we were laughing

1914
00:48:29.078 --> 00:48:29.980
and it was so fun.

1915
00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:30.711
And it was like

1916
00:48:30.751 --> 00:48:31.980
we were like little girls.

1917
00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:32.573
And she was like.

1918
00:48:32.613 --> 00:48:32.980
"Oh. my God.

1919
00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:34.980
This the best feeling."

1920
00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:35.620
She's like. "I can't believe

1921
00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:35.980
we're in our 40s

1922
00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:36.985
"and we still get

1923
00:48:37.025 --> 00:48:37.980
to act like this.

1924
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.839
How long are we gonna be able

1925
00:48:39.879 --> 00:48:40.980
to act like this?"

1926
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.333
And I'm like. "Sissy. we will

1927
00:48:42.373 --> 00:48:42.980
always be able

1928
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:43.980
to act like this."

1929
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.352
And then I stuck my finger

1930
00:48:45.392 --> 00:48:45.980
in her butt.

1931
00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:49.000
and she passed right out.

1932
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.146
So I walked into Dan's office

1933
00:48:53.186 --> 00:48:54.446
after my family left.

1934
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:55.980
and I was like. "Hey. Dan."

1935
00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:56.125
I go.

1936
00:48:56.165 --> 00:48:57.965
"Cannabis has changed my life.

1937
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:58.980
I'm meditating"--

1938
00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:00.317
I was meditating every morning

1939
00:49:00.357 --> 00:49:00.980
for 20 minutes.

1940
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:01.980
I was going to the airport.

1941
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:02.886
I wasn't even going

1942
00:49:02.926 --> 00:49:03.980
to the Fox News lounge.

1943
00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:04.980
I wasn't yelling at people

1944
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.257
who disagreed with me

1945
00:49:06.297 --> 00:49:06.980
politically.

1946
00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:07.539
I was trying

1947
00:49:07.579 --> 00:49:08.980
to have compassion and empathy.

1948
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:10.980
And I was being more patient.

1949
00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.672
and I was holding my tongue

1950
00:49:12.712 --> 00:49:12.980
more.

1951
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:13.536
And I said. "You know.

1952
00:49:13.576 --> 00:49:13.980
listen. Dan. like.

1953
00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:14.849
"cannabis is the way

1954
00:49:14.889 --> 00:49:15.980
to keep families together.

1955
00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.260
"Like. this is the best

1956
00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:18.980
family vacation we've ever had.

1957
00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:21.688
Like. everyone got along.

1958
00:49:21.728 --> 00:49:22.980
It was fun."

1959
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:23.436
And he said. "Great.

1960
00:49:23.476 --> 00:49:23.980
I'm in support of that."

1961
00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.301
And he handed me an orange.

1962
00:49:25.341 --> 00:49:25.980
very casually.

1963
00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.573
He said. "Hey. I picked this

1964
00:49:27.613 --> 00:49:28.980
off my tree this morning.

1965
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.357
I thought you might like

1966
00:49:30.397 --> 00:49:30.980
an orange."

1967
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.000
And I was revolted.

1968
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:35.458
I was like. "Orange?"

1969
00:49:35.498 --> 00:49:35.980
I'm like. first of all.

1970
00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:37.072
he knows how I feel

1971
00:49:37.112 --> 00:49:37.980
about this color

1972
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.000
since the election.

1973
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.980
And then I burst into tears.

1974
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:49.906
and I was so embarrassed.

1975
00:49:49.946 --> 00:49:50.980
'cause he had not seen me cry

1976
00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:51.587
and I didn't want him

1977
00:49:51.627 --> 00:49:51.980
to see me cry.

1978
00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.399
And I immediately put up

1979
00:49:53.439 --> 00:49:53.980
the orange

1980
00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:54.980
in front of my eyes.

1981
00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:55.980
I was. like. holding it.

1982
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.283
and then I was stabbing it

1983
00:49:57.323 --> 00:49:57.980
with my thumb.

1984
00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.010
so the citrus was squirting

1985
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:00.980
into my eyes.

1986
00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:01.980
I was like. "Ow. shit."

1987
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.980
And then I was really crying.

1988
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:04.501
and then I was. like.

1989
00:50:04.541 --> 00:50:04.980
convulsively crying.

1990
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.244
And there was snot

1991
00:50:06.284 --> 00:50:07.980
coming out of everywhere.

1992
00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:08.841
And then at one point.

1993
00:50:08.881 --> 00:50:09.980
somehow. snot had alley-ooped

1994
00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.404
up to my forehead and then

1995
00:50:11.444 --> 00:50:12.980
dropped back down to my chin.

1996
00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:13.980
I looked like Brett Kavanaugh

1997
00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.773
during his senate

1998
00:50:15.813 --> 00:50:17.980
confirmation hearing.

1999
00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.000
[imitates wailing]

2000
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.980
Like a big white male baby.

2001
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.980
[groans]

2002
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.000
And finally. I dropped it.

2003
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.200
And I looked at him.

2004
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.980
and I knew I had no way out.

2005
00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.533
And I said. "I need to tell you

2006
00:50:36.573 --> 00:50:37.980
about the day my brother died

2007
00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.631
and what happened

2008
00:50:39.671 --> 00:50:40.980
to my family."

2009
00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:41.887
And I told him

2010
00:50:41.927 --> 00:50:42.980
about my brother.

2011
00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.042
that there were six of us.

2012
00:50:44.082 --> 00:50:44.980
and I was the youngest.

2013
00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.185
I was the baby. and my brother

2014
00:50:46.225 --> 00:50:46.980
Chet was the oldest.

2015
00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.012
He was the only family member

2016
00:50:49.052 --> 00:50:49.980
who understood

2017
00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:50.753
that I was born

2018
00:50:50.793 --> 00:50:51.980
going through menopause.

2019
00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:54.980
that I was a sweaty baby.

2020
00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.695
you know. and that eventually

2021
00:50:56.735 --> 00:50:57.980
I would have to retire

2022
00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.107
somewhere probably

2023
00:50:59.147 --> 00:50:59.980
in the Arctic.

2024
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.352
And he was the only person

2025
00:51:01.392 --> 00:51:01.980
in my family

2026
00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:03.185
who knew that when I ate soup.

2027
00:51:03.225 --> 00:51:03.980
I had to be topless.

2028
00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.011
'cause I would

2029
00:51:05.051 --> 00:51:07.000
immediately start sweating.

2030
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.006
And when I was a little girl.

2031
00:51:11.046 --> 00:51:11.980
that was fine.

2032
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.430
And--but when I was eight.

2033
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.980
I remember

2034
00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:15.054
we had this summer house

2035
00:51:15.094 --> 00:51:15.980
in Martha's Vineyard.

2036
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:17.646
and my--my--my. like.

2037
00:51:17.686 --> 00:51:18.980
buds had come in.

2038
00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.111
You know. they weren't

2039
00:51:20.151 --> 00:51:20.980
really boobs yet.

2040
00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:21.609
but they were just. like.

2041
00:51:21.649 --> 00:51:21.980
flappy titties.

2042
00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:22.881
where your. like.

2043
00:51:22.921 --> 00:51:23.980
nipple just goes down

2044
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.441
before it's gonna burst.

2045
00:51:25.481 --> 00:51:25.980
you know.

2046
00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.307
And I remember hearing

2047
00:51:27.347 --> 00:51:28.980
my father say to my brother.

2048
00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:29.963
"You gotta cover her up

2049
00:51:30.003 --> 00:51:31.443
if you go into town now.

2050
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:32.412
Like. she can't

2051
00:51:32.452 --> 00:51:32.980
be topless anymore."

2052
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:33.980
'Cause I walked around topless

2053
00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.980
my entire childhood.

2054
00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:37.980
And I remember hearing that.

2055
00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:38.735
I'm like. "Ugh.

2056
00:51:38.775 --> 00:51:39.980
What's he talking about?"

2057
00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.341
And my brother

2058
00:51:41.381 --> 00:51:42.980
took me into town

2059
00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:43.438
to go to this place

2060
00:51:43.478 --> 00:51:44.858
called the Quarterdeck.

2061
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:45.582
where we would always

2062
00:51:45.622 --> 00:51:45.980
get fast food.

2063
00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.011
We would get--I mean.

2064
00:51:47.051 --> 00:51:47.980
it wasn't fast food.

2065
00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:48.598
but it was. like. you know.

2066
00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:48.980
a Vineyard place.

2067
00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:49.929
You get takeout.

2068
00:51:49.969 --> 00:51:50.980
like. fried clams.

2069
00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:51.980
or a lobster roll

2070
00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:52.296
or steamers

2071
00:51:52.336 --> 00:51:52.980
or whatever you're into.

2072
00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:54.079
And I remember that day.

2073
00:51:54.119 --> 00:51:54.980
I was sitting there.

2074
00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:55.485
and I was holding

2075
00:51:55.525 --> 00:51:55.980
my brother's hand

2076
00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.195
at the takeout counter.

2077
00:51:57.235 --> 00:51:57.980
and I was like.

2078
00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:58.980
"I'll have the clam chowder."

2079
00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:00.980
He's like. "Whoa. whoa. whoa."

2080
00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.244
He goes. "No cla--

2081
00:52:02.284 --> 00:52:04.000
let's not do soup today."

2082
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:05.568
And I said. "What do you mean?

2083
00:52:05.608 --> 00:52:05.980
I want clam chowder."

2084
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.135
He's like. "Ehh. that's not--

2085
00:52:08.175 --> 00:52:09.980
we can't have that today.

2086
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.980
"Like. we can take it to go.

2087
00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:12.986
"but we can't sit out

2088
00:52:13.026 --> 00:52:13.980
and eat clam chowder.

2089
00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:15.669
We'll explain it to you

2090
00:52:15.709 --> 00:52:16.980
when we get home."

2091
00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:17.769
And I was like.

2092
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:18.980
"But I really want it."

2093
00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.980
And he said. "Okay.

2094
00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:21.534
"If you really want it.

2095
00:52:21.574 --> 00:52:22.714
we can go in my car

2096
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:23.582
and you can eat it

2097
00:52:23.622 --> 00:52:23.980
in the car."

2098
00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:24.791
And I was like.

2099
00:52:24.831 --> 00:52:25.980
"All right. whatever."

2100
00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:28.980
And I'll never forget that day.

2101
00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:30.980
I sat in my brother's car

2102
00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.880
eating my clam chowder

2103
00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.980
with my top off.

2104
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.000
just sweating.

2105
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.980
And my brother had his back

2106
00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:41.806
against the passenger's side

2107
00:52:41.846 --> 00:52:41.980
window

2108
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:43.594
to cover up the little

2109
00:52:43.634 --> 00:52:44.980
eight-year-old girl

2110
00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:48.000
that was nude in his car.

2111
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Just like R. Kelly.

2112
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.146
And we used to have this game

2113
00:52:58.186 --> 00:52:58.980
where we'd be. like--

2114
00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.299
he'd come home from work.

2115
00:53:00.339 --> 00:53:00.980
and he'd come

2116
00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:01.980
running up to my parents' room.

2117
00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.165
and I was always hiding

2118
00:53:03.205 --> 00:53:03.980
under the covers

2119
00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:05.980
in my mom's bed.

2120
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:06.887
And he'd come up and go.

2121
00:53:06.927 --> 00:53:07.980
"Where is she? Where is she?"

2122
00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:08.420
It'd be. like.

2123
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:08.980
at 11:00 at night.

2124
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:10.062
And I'd hide under the covers

2125
00:53:10.102 --> 00:53:10.980
and my mom would be like.

2126
00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:12.980
"She's not here."

2127
00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.052
And I'd be like.

2128
00:53:14.092 --> 00:53:14.980
"Shut up. Mom.

2129
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.980
You're not even in this game."

2130
00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:17.791
And then he'd grab me

2131
00:53:17.831 --> 00:53:18.980
by the ankles under the covers.

2132
00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.062
throw me over his shoulders

2133
00:53:20.102 --> 00:53:20.980
and we'd run downstairs

2134
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.263
and we'd go into the kitchen

2135
00:53:22.303 --> 00:53:22.980
and I'd make him

2136
00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:24.980
a big bowl of Raisin Bran.

2137
00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:25.849
And I knew the exact

2138
00:53:25.889 --> 00:53:26.980
right ratio of Raisin Bran

2139
00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.107
to bananas to milk

2140
00:53:28.147 --> 00:53:28.980
that he liked.

2141
00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:29.980
And I would make him his dinner

2142
00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.261
and then we'd sit there

2143
00:53:31.301 --> 00:53:31.980
like a couple

2144
00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:33.980
and talk about our day.

2145
00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:35.276
And I remember him telling me

2146
00:53:35.316 --> 00:53:35.980
he wasn't coming

2147
00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:36.980
to Martha's Vineyard that year

2148
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.097
because he was going

2149
00:53:38.137 --> 00:53:38.980
on a hiking trip

2150
00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:39.980
in Jackson Hole. Wyoming.

2151
00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.062
And I was mad because I would

2152
00:53:41.102 --> 00:53:41.980
always drive up with him.

2153
00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:42.745
and he would leave

2154
00:53:42.785 --> 00:53:43.980
the window down the whole way

2155
00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.728
so I could have fresh air

2156
00:53:45.768 --> 00:53:46.980
blowing in my face

2157
00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.000
and be topless.

2158
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.317
And he said. "Don't worry.

2159
00:53:51.357 --> 00:53:51.980
I'll meet you

2160
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.980
"in two weeks on the Vineyard.

2161
00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:55.133
I will never. ever

2162
00:53:55.173 --> 00:53:57.000
leave you with these people."

2163
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.153
And then he went

2164
00:54:00.193 --> 00:54:01.980
to Jackson Hole. Wyoming.

2165
00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.719
and fell off a cliff

2166
00:54:03.759 --> 00:54:06.000
and died three days later.

2167
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.660
[voice breaking]

2168
00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.980
And Dan said. "What...

2169
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.980
then what happened?"

2170
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.980
And I said. "I just--

2171
00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:18.826
"I just remember

2172
00:54:18.866 --> 00:54:19.980
going into the kitchen

2173
00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.075
"and throwing away

2174
00:54:21.115 --> 00:54:21.980
all the cereal.

2175
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.056
"Like. cereal was over.

2176
00:54:23.096 --> 00:54:23.980
It was a wrap on it.

2177
00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:25.986
"Childhood was over.

2178
00:54:26.026 --> 00:54:27.980
Our family was over.

2179
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.097
I haven't had cereal

2180
00:54:29.137 --> 00:54:30.097
since that day."

2181
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.180
And he said. "What happened

2182
00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:35.980
with your family?"

2183
00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:36.980
And I said. "It was awful."

2184
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.168
My father was

2185
00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:39.980
this big. strong man

2186
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.135
who was in charge of everything

2187
00:54:41.175 --> 00:54:41.980
and didn't fuck around.

2188
00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.980
I'd never seen my father cry.

2189
00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:45.980
And I remember sitting shiva--

2190
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.111
you know. what Jews do

2191
00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:48.171
when people die--

2192
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:49.923
with all these relatives

2193
00:54:49.963 --> 00:54:50.980
and neighbors and strangers

2194
00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:52.273
coming to our house.

2195
00:54:52.313 --> 00:54:52.980
and my dad.

2196
00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:54.485
who was so strong

2197
00:54:54.525 --> 00:54:55.980
and so in charge.

2198
00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.486
sitting on the couch

2199
00:54:57.526 --> 00:54:58.980
like a baby. crying.

2200
00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:00.487
And I was looking at him.

2201
00:55:00.527 --> 00:55:01.980
and I was so embarrassed.

2202
00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:02.695
I was like.

2203
00:55:02.735 --> 00:55:03.980
"What are you doing?

2204
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:04.529
"What is happening.

2205
00:55:04.569 --> 00:55:05.529
what--he's dead.

2206
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.517
"and you're gonna di--

2207
00:55:06.557 --> 00:55:06.980
what are you doing?

2208
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.113
"Where the fuck

2209
00:55:08.153 --> 00:55:09.980
are the adults right now?

2210
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.201
I'm nine. I--

2211
00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:13.000
what is happening?"

2212
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.389
And I remember. I thought.

2213
00:55:17.429 --> 00:55:17.980
oh. I got--

2214
00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:18.980
I gotta grow up.

2215
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.985
This is--this is it.

2216
00:55:21.025 --> 00:55:21.980
It's over.

2217
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:24.370
And at some point. we went back

2218
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:25.980
to Martha's Vineyard.

2219
00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:27.117
to our summer house. and my dad

2220
00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:27.980
was sitting on the deck.

2221
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.336
and we had a house

2222
00:55:29.376 --> 00:55:30.980
in front of the water.

2223
00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:31.980
And he was sitting on the deck.

2224
00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.350
and my parents' faces had

2225
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:34.980
changed after my brother died.

2226
00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:36.527
They were just old.

2227
00:55:36.567 --> 00:55:37.980
all of the sudden.

2228
00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:38.960
And they were gray--

2229
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:39.980
and gray in the face.

2230
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:41.980
and I wanted joy back.

2231
00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:42.390
I didn't know

2232
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.980
what was happening.

2233
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.283
I just wanted to bring joy

2234
00:55:44.323 --> 00:55:44.980
to them again.

2235
00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.162
I wanted them to laugh again.

2236
00:55:47.202 --> 00:55:47.980
I wanted...

2237
00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.000
anything to happen.

2238
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.980
And I remember I walked outside

2239
00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.135
and I saw my father

2240
00:55:53.175 --> 00:55:53.980
sitting there.

2241
00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:54.980
just holding his head.

2242
00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.360
And it was a beautiful

2243
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:56.980
sunny day.

2244
00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:58.340
and I said. "Hey. Dad.

2245
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.067
"can we please just

2246
00:56:00.107 --> 00:56:00.980
go in the water?

2247
00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:01.980
I was like. "Please?"

2248
00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:02.564
And he said.

2249
00:56:02.604 --> 00:56:04.344
"No one's going in the water.

2250
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.980
My boy is dead."

2251
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:09.980
And I walked off the deck.

2252
00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:10.760
and I thought.

2253
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.980
I'm gonna go in alone.

2254
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:12.832
And the only rule

2255
00:56:12.872 --> 00:56:13.980
in my family growing up

2256
00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:15.485
was you could not

2257
00:56:15.525 --> 00:56:16.980
swim by yourself.

2258
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.366
You could shoot heroin

2259
00:56:19.406 --> 00:56:20.980
or hide a body.

2260
00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.980
but you could not swim alone.

2261
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:23.759
"Jaws" was filmed

2262
00:56:23.799 --> 00:56:24.980
on Martha's Vineyard. okay.

2263
00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:25.432
We were scared of

2264
00:56:25.472 --> 00:56:25.980
that mechanical shark

2265
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.980
for a long time.

2266
00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:28.980
But I didn't care. 'cause--

2267
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:30.527
and I was so scared

2268
00:56:30.567 --> 00:56:31.980
to defy my father.

2269
00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.168
My father would--you know.

2270
00:56:33.208 --> 00:56:33.980
he would smack me.

2271
00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.980
Like. I was scared of him.

2272
00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:37.520
especially in that state.

2273
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.255
But I didn't care

2274
00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:40.980
because my need for joy

2275
00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.980
was paramount to my fear.

2276
00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.980
And I walked off the deck.

2277
00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:45.681
and I remember

2278
00:56:45.721 --> 00:56:46.980
walking down to the water.

2279
00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.215
and I just said.

2280
00:56:48.255 --> 00:56:49.980
keep going. keep going.

2281
00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.291
And I got in the water.

2282
00:56:51.331 --> 00:56:52.980
and I swam out. like. 20 yards

2283
00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.980
and I turned around.

2284
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.000
And he had gone inside.

2285
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.980
And...

2286
00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:04.528
Dan said.

2287
00:57:04.568 --> 00:57:05.980
"Sit with that feeling."

2288
00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:07.603
And I said. "I can't.

2289
00:57:07.643 --> 00:57:08.980
It's too painful."

2290
00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:09.862
He said. "Sit with it.

2291
00:57:09.902 --> 00:57:11.582
What do you feel right now?"

2292
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.874
I'm like. "I'm so angry.

2293
00:57:13.914 --> 00:57:14.980
I'm so angry."

2294
00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.120
And he said. "Yes. but what's

2295
00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:16.980
underneath the anger?"

2296
00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.064
And I'm like. "Hurt.

2297
00:57:18.104 --> 00:57:18.980
I'm fucking hurt.

2298
00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.547
"I'm hurt that my brother

2299
00:57:20.587 --> 00:57:21.980
went off and ditched me

2300
00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:22.803
"when he told me

2301
00:57:22.843 --> 00:57:23.980
he was gonna come back.

2302
00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:25.980
And then my father ditched me."

2303
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:26.765
And he said. "Yes.

2304
00:57:26.805 --> 00:57:27.980
what's underneath the hurt?"

2305
00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:29.333
I'm like. "I don't know. Dan.

2306
00:57:29.373 --> 00:57:29.980
I'm paying you

2307
00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:30.508
to tell me

2308
00:57:30.548 --> 00:57:31.980
what's underneath the hurt."

2309
00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.980
He said. "Rejection.

2310
00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:35.980
"You took that as rejection.

2311
00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:36.816
"because that's what

2312
00:57:36.856 --> 00:57:37.980
a nine-year-old girl thinks.

2313
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:38.951
"It doesn't matter that your

2314
00:57:38.991 --> 00:57:39.980
brother had a hiking accident.

2315
00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.207
"It matters that he told you

2316
00:57:41.247 --> 00:57:41.980
he was coming back

2317
00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:42.980
"and he didn't come back.

2318
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.312
"so for a nine-year-old

2319
00:57:44.352 --> 00:57:45.980
little girl. he rejected you.

2320
00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:47.219
"And then your father

2321
00:57:47.259 --> 00:57:47.980
rejected you.

2322
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:49.546
"so you were broken up with

2323
00:57:49.586 --> 00:57:50.980
twice by the age of nine.

2324
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:51.936
"This is why.

2325
00:57:51.976 --> 00:57:53.980
when I handed you an orange.

2326
00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:55.980
"you were revolted.

2327
00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.370
"because it requires you

2328
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:58.980
to be vulnerable with a man.

2329
00:57:59.020 --> 00:57:59.980
"and you don't trust men.

2330
00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:02.050
because the two men

2331
00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:05.000
you trusted the most lied."

2332
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.874
And he said. "This is where

2333
00:58:09.914 --> 00:58:11.980
your lack of empathy comes in.

2334
00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:12.798
"How are you meant

2335
00:58:12.838 --> 00:58:13.980
to have empathy for anyone

2336
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:15.133
"when you've never even

2337
00:58:15.173 --> 00:58:15.980
grieved yourself?

2338
00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.297
"You've never allowed

2339
00:58:17.337 --> 00:58:17.980
yourself to

2340
00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.980
because you had to be strong."

2341
00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:22.552
And I'm looking at him.

2342
00:58:22.592 --> 00:58:23.980
hearing these things.

2343
00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:25.980
and I'm like...

2344
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.354
"Oh. my God.

2345
00:58:27.394 --> 00:58:30.000
I wanna fuck you. too."

2346
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.147
He's like. "You don't

2347
00:58:34.187 --> 00:58:34.980
wanna fuck me."

2348
00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:35.284
I'm like.

2349
00:58:35.324 --> 00:58:36.584
"I do in this moment.

2350
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.980
I wanna fuck you."

2351
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.370
He's like. "No. you want

2352
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:42.980
someone to take care of you.

2353
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:43.980
"That's why you hire guides

2354
00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.233
"and why you hook up

2355
00:58:45.273 --> 00:58:45.980
with guides.

2356
00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:48.158
'cause you're paying them

2357
00:58:48.198 --> 00:58:50.000
to take care of you."

2358
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:51.628
And he's like.

2359
00:58:51.668 --> 00:58:52.980
"And you're also paying them.

2360
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:53.338
technically.

2361
00:58:53.378 --> 00:58:53.980
to have sex with you."

2362
00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:54.854
I'm like.

2363
00:58:54.894 --> 00:58:57.000
"Dan. that's too far."

2364
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.739
I didn't know that my brother's

2365
00:58:59.779 --> 00:59:00.980
death was defining me.

2366
00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.187
I didn't know that

2367
00:59:02.227 --> 00:59:03.980
I had the ability to say no

2368
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.980
to being defined by death.

2369
00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:06.980
[sighs]

2370
00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.980
Now I was with a person

2371
00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.958
who could help me process

2372
00:59:10.998 --> 00:59:11.980
what happened

2373
00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:13.188
and turn the parts of me

2374
00:59:13.228 --> 00:59:13.980
that still acted

2375
00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:15.273
like a nine-year-old

2376
00:59:15.313 --> 00:59:15.980
little girl

2377
00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:17.980
into a self-actualized adult

2378
00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:18.791
who had come to

2379
00:59:18.831 --> 00:59:19.980
a better understanding

2380
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:20.852
of what it means

2381
00:59:20.892 --> 00:59:21.980
to dig deep and admit

2382
00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.980
that you're in pain.

2383
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.386
thereby relinquishing

2384
00:59:25.426 --> 00:59:25.980
that pain

2385
00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:26.818
or beginning to

2386
00:59:26.858 --> 00:59:27.980
relinquish that pain.

2387
00:59:28.020 --> 00:59:29.460
My brother dying no longer

2388
00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:30.980
had to define my existence.

2389
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.394
It's part of who I am--

2390
00:59:32.434 --> 00:59:33.980
perhaps the biggest part--

2391
00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:36.980
but it's not all of me.

2392
00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.980
I define me.

2393
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.980
I decide who I am.

2394
00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:44.000
No event or person does this.

2395
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:45.236
I decide

2396
00:59:45.276 --> 00:59:45.980
how I'm going to behave

2397
00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.152
and I know now that

2398
00:59:47.192 --> 00:59:48.980
vulnerability is not weakness.

2399
00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:53.000
that vulnerability is strength.

2400
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.980
So I was excited.

2401
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:00.686
I went home.

2402
01:00:00.726 --> 01:00:01.980
I was packing my bags.

2403
01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.726
I was leaving for Clearwater.

2404
01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:04.980
Florida. the next day

2405
01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.980
to visit the Scientologists...

2406
01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.176
to try and knock some sense

2407
01:00:10.216 --> 01:00:10.980
into them.

2408
01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.360
And I got on my plane.

2409
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.980
and I was feeling so good.

2410
01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:14.603
I had the information

2411
01:00:14.643 --> 01:00:15.423
that I needed

2412
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.980
to understand why I reacted--

2413
01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.143
you know. I wasn't mad

2414
01:00:18.183 --> 01:00:18.980
at Donald Trump.

2415
01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:19.636
Of course I fuckin' hate

2416
01:00:19.676 --> 01:00:19.980
Donald Trump.

2417
01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.640
but that was representative

2418
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:22.395
of the other time

2419
01:00:22.435 --> 01:00:23.875
my life became unhinged.

2420
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:24.903
It was a trigger--a word

2421
01:00:24.943 --> 01:00:25.980
I never thought I would use.

2422
01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.980
But it made sense.

2423
01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:28.772
And I was putting

2424
01:00:28.812 --> 01:00:29.980
all these pieces together.

2425
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.980
and I was so grateful.

2426
01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:32.980
And I was sitting on the plane.

2427
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.103
and I saw this large man

2428
01:00:34.143 --> 01:00:34.980
walking towards me.

2429
01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.487
and I was like. oh. I hope

2430
01:00:36.527 --> 01:00:37.980
he doesn't sit next to me.

2431
01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.951
I could tell by his body type

2432
01:00:39.991 --> 01:00:42.000
that he was a Trump supporter.

2433
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
He looked like a swollen tick.

2434
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.839
And he had these denim pants--

2435
01:00:52.879 --> 01:00:53.980
they're on--

2436
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:54.495
they weren't pants--

2437
01:00:54.535 --> 01:00:54.980
they weren't denim.

2438
01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:55.933
They looked denim.

2439
01:00:55.973 --> 01:00:56.980
but they were cloth.

2440
01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.026
And I was like...

2441
01:00:59.066 --> 01:00:59.980
[groans]

2442
01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.680
That is tricky.

2443
01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.980
I don't like that. I don't--

2444
01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:02.628
and then I was like.

2445
01:01:02.668 --> 01:01:02.980
no. no. no.

2446
01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:03.843
You--you're not

2447
01:01:03.883 --> 01:01:04.980
that person anymore.

2448
01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:05.980
You don't judge people based on

2449
01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.661
their denim-looking pants.

2450
01:01:07.701 --> 01:01:07.980
okay?

2451
01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.749
This person is a man

2452
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:10.980
with a family.

2453
01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:12.980
Stop looking at the exterior

2454
01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:13.745
and start thinking

2455
01:01:13.785 --> 01:01:14.980
about the interior of people.

2456
01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:16.980
That's what Dan taught me.

2457
01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:17.476
I was like. this is

2458
01:01:17.516 --> 01:01:17.980
a man with a family.

2459
01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.760
I immediately closed my eyes.

2460
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:20.980
Like. this is an opportunity.

2461
01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:22.057
This is an opportunity

2462
01:01:22.097 --> 01:01:22.980
to talk to somebody

2463
01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:23.980
who voted for Donald Trump

2464
01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.233
and actually be kind

2465
01:01:25.273 --> 01:01:25.980
and generous

2466
01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:26.810
and understand

2467
01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.050
or try to understand

2468
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:29.735
why they would

2469
01:01:29.775 --> 01:01:30.980
do something like that.

2470
01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:31.836
So I closed my eyes.

2471
01:01:31.876 --> 01:01:32.980
and I'm doing my breathing.

2472
01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:33.735
I'm like. okay.

2473
01:01:33.775 --> 01:01:34.980
opportunity. opportunity.

2474
01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.005
I'm like. think about his

2475
01:01:36.045 --> 01:01:36.980
family; he's got a wife.

2476
01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:37.343
I'm like. well.

2477
01:01:37.383 --> 01:01:37.980
she probably hates him too.

2478
01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:38.724
I'm like. no.

2479
01:01:38.764 --> 01:01:39.980
I'm like. no. Chelsea.

2480
01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.320
Wives love husbands usually.

2481
01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:41.980
I mean. just--

2482
01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:42.933
no. he has children.

2483
01:01:42.973 --> 01:01:44.293
He's someone's father.

2484
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:45.314
And I'm like.

2485
01:01:45.354 --> 01:01:45.980
they fuckin' hate him too.

2486
01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.206
I'm like. if they saw him

2487
01:01:47.246 --> 01:01:47.980
in these shorts.

2488
01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.980
they'd fuckin' be pissed too.

2489
01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:51.980
And I was like. no. no. no.

2490
01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:52.663
And then I--I was like. okay.

2491
01:01:52.703 --> 01:01:52.980
I can do this.

2492
01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:54.455
I ordered from the flight

2493
01:01:54.495 --> 01:01:55.980
attendant a bowl of cereal

2494
01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:56.573
for my first time

2495
01:01:56.613 --> 01:01:57.333
in 30 years.

2496
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.980
I was like. I am gonna do this.

2497
01:01:59.020 --> 01:01:59.450
I'm gonna have

2498
01:01:59.490 --> 01:01:59.980
a bowl of cereal

2499
01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.980
with a side of Republican.

2500
01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:03.695
And I took my first bite

2501
01:02:03.735 --> 01:02:03.980
of cereal.

2502
01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.266
and that's when I smelled

2503
01:02:05.306 --> 01:02:05.980
my first fart.

2504
01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:09.000
There were eight.

2505
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:10.741
I know this

2506
01:02:10.781 --> 01:02:12.000
because I counted.

2507
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:13.531
because they were

2508
01:02:13.571 --> 01:02:13.980
like tsunamis.

2509
01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.046
You thought one was over.

2510
01:02:15.086 --> 01:02:16.406
and then it was done--

2511
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.099
you know. a tsunami happens.

2512
01:02:18.139 --> 01:02:18.980
and the water recedes.

2513
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.127
and people come down

2514
01:02:20.167 --> 01:02:20.980
from the trees.

2515
01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:21.472
and they're like.

2516
01:02:21.512 --> 01:02:21.980
"Okay. it's gone."

2517
01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:22.379
And then. fuck.

2518
01:02:22.419 --> 01:02:22.980
another wave is coming.

2519
01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:24.980
That's what that was like.

2520
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:26.097
So the first one. I was like.

2521
01:02:26.137 --> 01:02:26.980
whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

2522
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:27.983
Is that me?

2523
01:02:28.023 --> 01:02:28.980
Did I fart?

2524
01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:29.530
And then there was

2525
01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:29.980
the second one.

2526
01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:31.399
I'm like oh. he--

2527
01:02:31.439 --> 01:02:32.980
he's farting on me.

2528
01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:34.038
This Trump supporter

2529
01:02:34.078 --> 01:02:34.980
is really. really.

2530
01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.980
really checking me right now.

2531
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.980
This is really testing me.

2532
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:40.700
And then I'm thinking. like.

2533
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:40.980
oh. my God.

2534
01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:42.441
he needs a panty shield.

2535
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:42.980
you know.

2536
01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:43.867
Like. this is--

2537
01:02:43.907 --> 01:02:44.980
he needs something.

2538
01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:45.562
He definitely needs

2539
01:02:45.602 --> 01:02:45.980
a doxycycline.

2540
01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.010
So I went in my bag.

2541
01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:47.980
and I got some out.

2542
01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:48.546
I took one.

2543
01:02:48.586 --> 01:02:49.980
I also put one on his plate.

2544
01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.980
but I closed my eyes.

2545
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.245
And I was like. just breathe.

2546
01:02:53.285 --> 01:02:53.980
breathe. breathe.

2547
01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.379
You can deal with this too.

2548
01:02:55.419 --> 01:02:56.980
This is just another challenge.

2549
01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.980
[inhales. exhales]

2550
01:02:59.020 --> 01:02:59.460
And then I realized

2551
01:02:59.500 --> 01:02:59.980
I was sucking the air

2552
01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.980
from his asshole into my nose.

2553
01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.341
And I was like. no...

2554
01:03:03.381 --> 01:03:03.980
[exhaling]

2555
01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.580
Remembered my--the Lamaze

2556
01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:06.980
from my fake daughter.

2557
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:08.399
and I was like...

2558
01:03:08.439 --> 01:03:09.980
[breathing heavily]

2559
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:10.887
And I kept my eyes shut.

2560
01:03:10.927 --> 01:03:11.980
I obviously lost my appetite.

2561
01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.980
I didn't eat anything else.

2562
01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.544
And when the flight attendant

2563
01:03:15.584 --> 01:03:16.980
came over to clear my tray.

2564
01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:17.980
I didn't even look up.

2565
01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.486
I just sat there trying

2566
01:03:19.526 --> 01:03:20.980
to get myself together.

2567
01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.085
And then finally. he got up

2568
01:03:22.125 --> 01:03:22.980
to go to the bathroom.

2569
01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:23.902
And when he did.

2570
01:03:23.942 --> 01:03:24.980
she came back over.

2571
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:25.449
and she said.

2572
01:03:25.489 --> 01:03:25.980
"Are you okay?"

2573
01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:27.980
And I'm like. "Are you?"

2574
01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:29.980
And then I turned around

2575
01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.273
to look at the other

2576
01:03:31.313 --> 01:03:32.000
hostages...

2577
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.980
I was like. "People are going

2578
01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:38.980
to pass away on this flight."

2579
01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.510
And she said. "Well. hopefully

2580
01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.980
he's just in the bathroom now

2581
01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:45.980
getting rid of it."

2582
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:46.810
I said. "What?

2583
01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:47.980
You can't say that."

2584
01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:48.717
I was like.

2585
01:03:48.757 --> 01:03:49.980
"Getting rid of it?

2586
01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:50.577
"You need to call ahead

2587
01:03:50.617 --> 01:03:51.577
to the airport--

2588
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.056
"you need to call ahead

2589
01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:53.980
to the airport and--

2590
01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:54.985
"do you guys have

2591
01:03:55.025 --> 01:03:55.980
a hospital there?

2592
01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.248
"Because he's gonna need

2593
01:03:57.288 --> 01:03:57.980
a colonoscopy.

2594
01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:58.565
"Okay. and you need to see

2595
01:03:58.605 --> 01:03:58.980
if there's a doctor

2596
01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:00.980
"or a vet on board. okay?

2597
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:01.877
"This is a ser--

2598
01:04:01.917 --> 01:04:02.980
he went to Chipotle.

2599
01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.349
and things took

2600
01:04:04.389 --> 01:04:06.000
a hard left turn."

2601
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:11.480
And he comes out

2602
01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:11.980
of the bathroom.

2603
01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:12.980
and she scuttles away.

2604
01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:13.980
and I'm like. oh. God.

2605
01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:15.640
I'm like. okay. okay. okay.

2606
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:16.869
You have to think of

2607
01:04:16.909 --> 01:04:17.980
the most loving. kind way

2608
01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.403
to tell someone

2609
01:04:20.443 --> 01:04:22.980
to stop farting.

2610
01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.980
So he comes walking over.

2611
01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:25.877
and he sits down

2612
01:04:25.917 --> 01:04:26.980
and it's loud and...

2613
01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:27.801
[exhales]

2614
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:29.000
I said. "Sir.

2615
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.134
will you please

2616
01:04:31.174 --> 01:04:33.000
stop what you're doing?"

2617
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.766
And he said. "Excuse me?"

2618
01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:39.000
I go. "Stop it with your butt."

2619
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.980
[squeaks meekly]

2620
01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.230
And then I just covered my eyes

2621
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.980
and I sat like this

2622
01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.487
for the rest of the flight.

2623
01:04:46.527 --> 01:04:47.980
rocking myself like a baby.

2624
01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:48.367
And I was like.

2625
01:04:48.407 --> 01:04:48.980
don't say anything else.

2626
01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:49.588
don't say anything else.

2627
01:04:49.628 --> 01:04:50.588
don't be a cunt.

2628
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:51.341
don't be a cunt.

2629
01:04:51.381 --> 01:04:51.980
don't start a confrontation.

2630
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:52.841
You've farted too.

2631
01:04:52.881 --> 01:04:53.980
You've farted too. okay.

2632
01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.042
You've had bad situations.

2633
01:04:55.082 --> 01:04:55.980
Remember Panda Express?

2634
01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.109
Remember?

2635
01:04:57.149 --> 01:04:57.980
Don't--

2636
01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.989
don't judge him.

2637
01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.980
don't judge him.

2638
01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.036
And I was so excited.

2639
01:05:03.076 --> 01:05:03.980
We were descending.

2640
01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:04.988
And I was like. you did it. you

2641
01:05:05.028 --> 01:05:05.980
did it. you didn't do anything.

2642
01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:06.772
Like. if that had

2643
01:05:06.812 --> 01:05:07.980
just been six months ago--

2644
01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:08.854
six months before

2645
01:05:08.894 --> 01:05:09.980
I had gone to therapy.

2646
01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.341
just six months--he would have

2647
01:05:12.381 --> 01:05:13.980
gone to the bathroom.

2648
01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.000
I would've formed a gang.

2649
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.253
I would be the leader

2650
01:05:20.293 --> 01:05:20.980
of the gang.

2651
01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.128
I would've lurched at him

2652
01:05:23.168 --> 01:05:23.980
like this.

2653
01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:24.872
grabbed him by the neck.

2654
01:05:24.912 --> 01:05:26.712
pinned him down on the floor--

2655
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:27.647
'cause I have strength

2656
01:05:27.687 --> 01:05:27.980
like that--

2657
01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:28.628
and flipped him over

2658
01:05:28.668 --> 01:05:29.328
like a baby

2659
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
and stapled his asshole shut.

2660
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.480
But I didn't do that

2661
01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.980
because I'm growing.

2662
01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.980
And they're called baby steps.

2663
01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:43.798
So as we were

2664
01:05:43.838 --> 01:05:44.980
leaving the plane--

2665
01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:45.959
the plane had landed.

2666
01:05:45.999 --> 01:05:46.980
he gathered his stuff.

2667
01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:47.980
I didn't make eye contact.

2668
01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:49.662
We never had the relationship

2669
01:05:49.702 --> 01:05:50.980
I thought we could have

2670
01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.146
because he ruined it

2671
01:05:53.186 --> 01:05:54.980
with his asshole.

2672
01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:56.120
And the flight attendant came

2673
01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:56.980
over as I was leaving.

2674
01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:57.891
and she's like. "It was a

2675
01:05:57.931 --> 01:05:58.980
pleasure having you on board."

2676
01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.980
I was like. "Yeah. thank you."

2677
01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.081
I was like.

2678
01:06:02.121 --> 01:06:04.980
"The pleasure was all yours."

2679
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:05.420
And she said. "Hey.

2680
01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.960
can I ask you something?"

2681
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:07.435
And I was like.

2682
01:06:07.475 --> 01:06:08.555
"Yeah. of course."

2683
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.252
And she said. "I heard

2684
01:06:10.292 --> 01:06:11.980
a funny story about you once."

2685
01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:14.980
I was like. "Oh. really?"

2686
01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:16.980
I go. "Which one?"

2687
01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:17.446
She said. "I heard

2688
01:06:17.486 --> 01:06:17.980
you were so high once

2689
01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:19.986
you tried to get off

2690
01:06:20.026 --> 01:06:22.000
a plane mid-flight."

2691
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:27.580
I said.

2692
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.980
"I've heard that story too."

2693
01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:30.807
I said.

2694
01:06:30.847 --> 01:06:33.980
"That was Elizabeth Banks."

2695
01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.980
Thank you. guys!

2696
01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.530
Does anybody want

2697
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:39.980
some complementary oranges?

2698
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.980
There you go.

2699
01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.518
Thank you. New Jersey.

2700
01:06:43.558 --> 01:06:44.980
It's good to be home.

[upbeat music]

2702
01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.980
Oh. yeah!

2703

Thank you. guys!

2704
01:06:50.525 --> 01:06:51.485
I love you guys.
