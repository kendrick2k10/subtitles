00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:03.753
- Totally true. 100%.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.943

my friend Annabelle at Camp Jewel told me

10
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.833
- So finish the story.

11
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.593
- Okay.

12
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.040
So he's a evil kind of critter
that shuffles around town

13
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.200
and they call him the-

14
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.260
- Oh. the Chupacabra.

15
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.170
- No.

16
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810
- Dogman. it's the Dogman.

17
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.643
- No.

18
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.573
Anyone else?

19
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.457
They call him the-

20
00:01:37.457 --> 00:01:38.290
- Oh. Mothman.

21
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.123
- No.

22
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.230
He's the Hogback.

23
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:44.497
And he'll getcha!

24
00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:45.970
If you don't watch out.

25
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.320
People know he's evil.

26
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.483
- Why do they call him the Hogback?

27
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.513
- By the way he shuffles around.

28
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.053
Has this evil look in his eye.

29
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.543
He carries a knife. or pitchfork.

30
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.350
Children swear he's crazy.

31
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.183
- Hell no.

32
00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:14.565
(people chattering)
(Bigfoot snorting)

33
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.570
- [Boy] Where do you come
up with this stuff anyway?

34
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.070
- [Girl] Hey. did anyone else notice

35
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.960
the crickets stopped chirping?

36
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.110
- [Girl] Yeah. I wonder if it has anything

37
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.370
to do with that skunk.

38
00:02:26.308 --> 00:02:27.141
Weird.

39
00:02:30.923 --> 00:02:33.840
(insects chirping)

40
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.333
- Danny.

41
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.380
Danny.

42
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.213
- What?

43
00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:52.113
- It's this one.

44
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.000
- Toss it away.

45
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.550
That's no Psilocybin.

46
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.413
Get back to work.

47
00:02:59.037 --> 00:03:01.530
And don't be nibbling on any.

48
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.280
I don't need you tripping out here.

49
00:03:06.795 --> 00:03:09.910
(owl hooting)

50
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.060
- This really worth it?

51
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.280
- Damn right it is.

52
00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:16.583
You know how much we can get for these?

53
00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:44.958
- Danny?

- When are these people going to learn?

57
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.543
- Probably never.

58
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.613
- Brutal.

59
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.303
- Yeah.

60
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.500
We got something.

61
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.713
Hey there.

62
00:04:29.543 --> 00:04:30.453
It's okay.

63
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.450
It's gonna be all right. Come on.

65
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.930
What's your name?

66
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.333
- Sadie. Landis.

67
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.737
- Sadie.

68
00:04:49.737 --> 00:04:51.938
What happened here?

69
00:04:51.938 --> 00:04:53.530
- I'm not really sure.

70
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.663
It was dark.

71
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.830
- How do you know the victim?

72
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.993
- He's my stepfather.

73
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.603
- I'm sorry for your loss.

74
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.670
I know this isn't easy.

- Yes. sir.

80
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.940
- What's up?
- Cortez is en route.

81
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.390
He wants to talk to the girl.

82
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.210
- It's just protocol.

83
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.753
Come on. we'll get you something to eat.

84
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.613
- This won't take long. will it?

85

Kids are here.

106

- [Mary] Great.

107
00:07:09.352 --> 00:07:10.360
- So how you doing. sir?

108
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.990
- Ah. you know. one foot in the
grave. one on a banana peel.

109
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.823
- I hear you.

110
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.640
- And how are you. Dante?

111
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.800
- I'm doing well. Mary. ty.

112
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.633
How are you?

113
00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:21.330
- I'm fine.
- Good.

114
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.580
- Let me get some coffee.

115
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.490
- So what's up. Charlie?

116
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.170
What'd you want to talk to me about that?

117
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.920
- Lost a goat last week. and lately.

118
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.513
it seems like the deer just
vanished from the property.

119
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.970
I think I may have a big cat
running around out there.

120
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:48.803
- Really?

121
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:54.810
- You know. I just can't
get out there much anymore.

122
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.700
- No. it's fine.

123
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.720
I'm happy to go take a look for you.

124
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.093
- Well. you're used to
going and tracking humans.

125
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.590
- Oh. not for a while.

126
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.040
But I did buy a hunting rifle this year.

127
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.190
I guess it's time I
take it out of the box.

128
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.900
- Well. I do have a trail cam up there.

129
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.363
It's way up in the back
near the deer feeder.

130
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.910
I've been out there a couple
of times. haven't seen nothing.

131
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.850
but you're welcome to go take a look.

132
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.120
- Yeah.

133
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.493
I'll do that for sure.

134
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.870
And what's up with the tree
down along the driveway there?

135
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.150
What happened?

136
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.000
I don't know. it came down last night.

137
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.930
No idea what caused it.

138
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.973
I mean. we didn't have any bad weather.

139
00:08:39.466 --> 00:08:41.453
Thank you. Mom.
- Thank you so much.

140
00:08:44.682 --> 00:08:47.460
- Well. I don't know
what's going on out there.

141
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.790
but it ain't no coyotes howling

142
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.640
in the middle of the night like that.

143
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.643
Whenever it is. probably
uprooting my tomato plants too.

144
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.860
- Mom. you've been hearing howling?

145
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.430
- I have.

146
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.020
And it's loud enough that I can hear it

147
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.423
over your dad's snoring.

148
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.393
- Why haven't you said
anything about this before?

149
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.433
- I know you didn't want me to worry.

150
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.033
Well. I'll leave you boys to it.

151
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.900
You know. I have noticed
that the government's

152
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.990
been putting up a lot of
those restricted area signs

153
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.453
along those forest
service roads into town.

154
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.323
There may be no correlation.

155
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.980
But it seems kinda odd to me.

156
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.023

188
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.730
- She's an addict. sir.

189
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.563
The least we could have done is-

190
00:12:46.563 --> 00:12:48.630
- Are you out of your mind?

191
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.730

at night. throwing rocks.
screaming. whistling.

369
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.910
and I can't seem to get
away from them. practically.

370
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.990
when I take these trips up there.

371
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.150
And I've often wondered why this happens.

372
00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.630
and I think they're
intuitive to the people

373
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.150
that come up there.
whether they're. you know.

374
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.860
troublemakers or they're rather cool.

375
00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.460
And up until a couple years ago.

376
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.250
I thought they were just like some kind of

377
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.310
a caveman-ape hybrid.

378
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:07.840
But a couple years ago.
at night while camping.

379
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.730
I saw a white orb that was
in the same general area

380
00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.450
where I had some Bigfoot activity.

381
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:18.040
and I believe they are what
they call the Nephilim.

382
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.790
which is in Genesis 6:4 in the Bible.

383
00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.400
- Interesting. yeah.
Nephilim. I've actually

384
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.640
heard of that before.

385
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.610
- Well. the Nephilim were supposed to be

386
00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:29.210
a hybrid between the sons of God.

387
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.080
which some interpret as the fallen angels.

388
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.270
with human women that
created a race of giants.

389
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.240
The one most people are
familiar with is Goliath

390
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.760
from David and Goliath.

391
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.080
And I believe these Bigfoots
are direct descendant

392
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.900
or at least related to
that group of giants.

393
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.410
This opinion is not very popular.

394
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:52.573
but after 36 years in the
field. that's the one I have.

395
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.750
- Wow. yeah. that's very interesting.

396
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.420
Thank you so much for that interview.

397
00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.270
- You're welcome.

398
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:05.781
(birds chirping)

399
00:27:17.032 --> 00:27:20.199
- Mind if I sit down?
- Yeah. go ahead.

400
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.953
- Nice day. huh?

401
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:27.743
- It is.

402
00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.470
- You don't recognize me?

403
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.050
- You remind me of someone.

404
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:35.913
- It's me. Landon.

405
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.330
Steve Garrett's son?

406
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.960
- Oh. wow.

407
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.863
All grown up.

408
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.080
Almost.

409
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:44.913
- [Landon] Yeah.

410
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.503
- Your father was a great
border patrol agent.

411
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.203
and a great man.

412
00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:54.890
- Thank you. sir.

413
00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:57.810
He thought the world of you.

414
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.060
Telling me some crazy
stories about you guys

415
00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:01.960
when I was little.

416
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.200
- Yeah.

417
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.300
Yeah. we had some fun.

418
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.210
He died protecting his country.

419
00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:11.700
- Yeah.

420
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.600
He wouldn't have had it any other way.

421
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.433
- Yeah.

422
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.400
So what's up. Landon?

423
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.700
You look like you have
something on your mind.

424
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.073
- Well...

425
00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:30.963
My mom thinks that I crunch
numbers for the IRS. right?

426
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:36.870
But actually. I'm
assigned to the Pentagon's

427
00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.120
advanced threat identification team.

428
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:40.953
- Wow.

429
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.540
What the hell is that?

430
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.053
- It's complicated.

431
00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:53.820
- Wait. secret agent Landon Garrett?

432
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:56.970
- I'm actually an intel analyst.

433
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.470
I was over at MIT.

434
00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:00.433
They recruited me.

435
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.253
- Impressive.

436
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.283
- Listen. you're on our radar.

437
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.053
- What's going on. Landon?

438
00:29:27.174 --> 00:29:29.850
- Look. I shouldn't be telling you this.

439
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.790
but we run surveillance on
anybody poking around that area.

440
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.700
and when your vehicle
registration popped up.

441
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.390
I almost...

442
00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:39.440
- So it's true. then.

443
00:29:40.387 --> 00:29:41.550
- Is what true?

444
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.350
- The government covers up the existence

445
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.683
of certain creatures.

446
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.160
- What do you mean?

447
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.040
- Well. I saw something on a trail cam.

448
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.190
there's these government
restricted area signs

449
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.880
popping up everywhere.
and now you're telling me

450
00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.700
that there's a sneaky government agency

451
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.000
that's pulling surveillance
in that same area?

452
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.450
- I see your point. sir. but you should

453
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:08.933
really stay out of that area.

454
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.640
- Landon. I really appreciate
you reaching out to me.

455
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.390
But Brooke's parents live up there.

456
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.673
Livestock and wildlife are disappearing.

457
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.700
I mean. what's next. them?

458
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.880
Can Uncle Sam guarantee their safety?

459
00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.530
Don't answer that. we
both know the answer.

460
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.840
- With all due respect. sir.
this isn't dope smugglers.

461
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.770
Okay. there's something out there

462
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.513
that we do not fully understand.

463
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.130
Just don't go out there.

464
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.673
- Okay.

465
00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:41.643
- Okay.

466
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.700
Really?

467
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:44.533
- Absolutely.

468
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.620
- What are you doing with your gear?

469
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.013
- I'm just gonna hike around
up at your parents' place.

470
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.790
- Are you camping overnight?

471
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.653
- Well. yeah.

472
00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:19.240
I need to hike out far enough
to set up the bait stations

473
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.580
to where they're not
drawing the predator in

474
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.680
towards the livestock.

475
00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.550
- That sounds dangerous.

476
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:28.853
- Danger's my middle name.

477
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.903
- Oh. God.

478
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.900
I'll come with you.

479
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.640
- No. Brooke. please.

480
00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.970
Not this trip.

481
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.570
I'll be gone one night. two max.

482
00:31:41.214 --> 00:31:43.593
All right. stay with your
parents. you have fun.

483
00:32:00.979 --> 00:32:03.479
(tense music)

484
00:32:59.133 --> 00:33:01.543
- Miss Thomas?
- Agent Cortez.

485
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.830
- We're at a critical point in this op.

486
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:06.060
Every move we make is crucial.

487
00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.380
- Yes sir. I agree.

488
00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.620
- Good.

489
00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.360
We're pulling all surveillance equipment.

490
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.193
- Sir?

491
00:33:12.807 --> 00:33:14.100
(Cortez sighs)

492
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.270
- As you know. Intel
suggests that our subject

493
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.070
may or may not be able to
detect the infrared light

494
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:21.660
from our cameras.

495
00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.590
I believe he's avoiding them completely.

496
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.920
This could provoke him to leave the area.

497
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.290
and we will not have any more sightings.

498
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:29.620
- So how will we monitor the situation?

499
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.290
This just seems
counter-intuitive to our mission.

500
00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.800
- Stay in your lane. Thomas.

501
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.140
You're an analyst.

502
00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.463
Don't overanalyze.

503
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.533
- Right.

504
00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:41.440
- This thing's like a wet fish.

505
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.570
Every time we tighten our grip.

506
00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.230
it slips right through our fingertips.

507
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.980
I'll have Smith and
Hutchins and my disposal.

508
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.240
outside of that. I want
everyone out of the AO

509
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.640
and awaiting further orders.

510
00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:51.570
Is that understood?

511
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.828
- Yes. sir.

512
00:33:54.828 --> 00:33:55.661
- Good.

513
00:34:11.342 --> 00:34:14.092
(birds chirping)

514
00:34:26.617 --> 00:34:27.971
Hey Dad

515
00:34:27.971 --> 00:34:29.742
- Good morning.

516
00:34:29.742 --> 00:34:30.920
- Morning.

517
00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.780
- Well. you're all ready to go.

518
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.400
- Yes. sir.

519
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.470
I'm going to hike out a ways while
there's still plenty of daylight.

520
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:38.760
- You're really gonna camp out there?

521
00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.000
- Yeah. for sure.

522
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.110
And I'll get that tree
cleaned up when I get back.

523
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.530
- Don't worry about that.

524
00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:44.940
You just take care of yourself.

525
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.490
- [Dante] Yes. ma'am.

526
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:47.880
- You going with him?

527
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.770
- Oh. no.

528
00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.640
I thought I'd spend
some time with you guys.

529
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.280
- Oh. great.

530
00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.830
- You're not moving in. are ya?

531
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:57.043
- No.

532
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.840
- Would you like to join us for breakfast?

533
00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.030
- Oh. that sounds amazing.

534
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:03.860
But I better pass.

535
00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.120
I got a long way.

536
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.180
- Your loss.

537
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.013
- I'm sure.

538
00:35:08.007 --> 00:35:09.407
- You're a jerk.
- Love you too.

539
00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:11.614
Be safe out there.

540
00:35:11.614 --> 00:35:12.447
Yes sir.

541
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.600
- So Denise. you said
you had this experience

542
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.083
when you were a child?

543
00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.270
- Yes.

544
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:07.400
I was probably about 12 or 13.

545
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.910
My parents rented a cabin
up in Unicoi State Park

546
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.550
in North Georgia.

547
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.030
My dad and brother and I decided to go

548
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.370
hiking near the river.

549
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.090
At some point. I decided
to go ahead of my dad

550
00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.920
and my little brother.

551
00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.780
At that point. I felt as
if someone was watching me.

552
00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.560
someone was with me.

553
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.320
The first thing I do is look to my left.

554
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.803
where the river is. and
I don't see anything.

555
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.350
There's all trees on my right. when I go

556
00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:39.713
and look to my right. the
trees are staggered in and out.

557
00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.580
Something comes out of the trees.

558
00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:44.890
It's tall. it's on two legs.

559
00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:49.890
It's got long. black. stringy
hair. and it takes one step.

560
00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:53.370
As I turn and look at it. it looks at me

561
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.680
and takes another step.

562
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.070
I turn and take off running.

563
00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:01.180
I run all the way back to the cabin.

564
00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:03.520
go upstairs in the loft. hide.

565
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.730
My mother asked. "What's wrong?"

566
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.630
I screamed to her. "There's a
monster. there's a monster."

567
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:10.380
- Wow.

568
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:13.913
And did this change your
perception of reality at all?

569
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.013
- Yes.

570
00:37:16.013 --> 00:37:18.513
I was never afraid of a
monster under my bed before.

571
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:21.340
- Very interesting.

572
00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.363
Thank you so much.

573
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.113
- You're welcome.

574
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:42.500
(upbeat ringtone music)

575
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.333
- Sup. Judith.

576
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.350
- I met with Cortez.

577
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:48.590
They're pulling all the
surveillance equipment.

578
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:49.680
- Yeah. I could see that.

579
00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.680
Why?

580
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.240
- The infrared lights on the cameras.

581
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.690
- I get that.

582
00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.963
We discussed that possibility
in the past. but why now?

583
00:37:57.963 --> 00:37:59.840
I thought we were surveilling
the people. not the creature.

584
00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.290
- I don't know.

585
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:05.090
He wants us out of the area
to await further instruction.

586
00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:06.730
- Really?

587
00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:07.900
- Yeah.

588
00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.630
Just stay in touch?

589
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.360
I'm gonna lay low for a while.

590
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.723
I suggest you do the same.

591
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.653
- Roger that.

592
00:38:16.975 --> 00:38:18.521
- And Garrett?

593
00:38:18.521 --> 00:38:19.760
- [Landon] Yeah?

594
00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.660
- Take off that hat.

595
00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:21.793
You look ridiculous.

596
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.693
- What else have you seen?
- Gotta go.

597
00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.247
- World famous.

598
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:08.182
(coyotes howling)

599
00:42:16.968 --> 00:42:19.718
(fire crackling)

600
00:42:24.702 --> 00:42:27.535
(coyotes howling)

601
00:42:30.459 --> 00:42:32.959
(eerie distant howl)

602
00:42:41.844 --> 00:42:45.511
(Bigfoot breathing)

603
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.302
(fire crackling)

604
00:43:04.302 --> 00:43:07.135
(coyotes howling)

605
00:43:21.751 --> 00:43:24.168
(twig snaps)

606
00:43:39.418 --> 00:43:43.518
(chattering on police radio)

607
00:43:43.518 --> 00:43:44.351
(radio beeps)

608
00:43:44.351 --> 00:43:46.351
- [Man On Radio] 10-3. greeen traffic.

609
00:43:46.351 --> 00:43:49.518
(radio static buzzes)

610
00:43:52.116 --> 00:43:52.949
(radio beeps)

611
00:43:52.949 --> 00:43:55.264
I got the brush-out across the levee.

612
00:43:55.264 --> 00:43:59.103
(radio beeps)
- 10-four.

613
00:43:59.103 --> 00:44:00.837
- 317. 323.

614
00:44:00.837 --> 00:44:01.911
(radio static buzzes)

615
00:44:01.911 --> 00:44:03.133
(radio beeps)
- Go ahead.

616
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:07.818
- Yeah. I'm in position
just north of that location.

617
00:44:07.818 --> 00:44:09.179
(radio static buzzes)

618
00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:10.530
(radio beeps)
- 10-four.

619
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:12.160
I got the foot-sign going into the grove.

620
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.832
just south of that patch of woods.

621
00:44:13.832 --> 00:44:17.180
(radio static buzzes)

622
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:19.833
- Copy that.
(radio beeps)

623
00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:28.333
(insects chirping)

624
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:38.167
(gunshots banging)

625
00:44:40.076 --> 00:44:42.950
(radio beeps)
- Shots fired. shots fired.

626
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:44.714
It's gonna be 10-46 traffic.

627
00:44:44.714 --> 00:44:46.079
(radio static buzzes)

628
00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:50.453
- Roger that.
(gunshots banging)

629
00:44:50.453 --> 00:44:54.203
(chattering on police radio)

630
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.229
- 323. you copy?

631
00:44:57.229 --> 00:44:59.199
(radio beeping)

632
00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:00.116
323. 10-18.

633
00:45:10.174 --> 00:45:13.091
(gunshots banging)

634
00:45:24.172 --> 00:45:26.672
(eerie distant howl)

635
00:45:32.665 --> 00:45:35.582
(tree knocking)

636
00:45:42.264 --> 00:45:45.181
(Bigfoot growling)

637
00:46:04.849 --> 00:46:08.516
(Bigfoot breathing heavily)

638
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:20.047
(Tree knocks)

639
00:46:28.431 --> 00:46:31.624
(eerie distant howl)

640
00:46:31.624 --> 00:46:34.541
(Bigfoot growling)

641
00:47:12.932 --> 00:47:16.599
(Bigfoot breathing heavily)

642
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.493
(insect chirping)

643
00:47:19.493 --> 00:47:24.493
(Bigfoot pants)
(insect stops chirping)

644
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:33.220
- 60% of Americans have given up on that.

645
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.053
We can help.

646
00:47:34.053 --> 00:47:36.367
We have DNA-based weight loss.

647
00:47:36.367 --> 00:47:37.200
(alarm clock beeping)

648
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.450
Which means you only eat
food that's meant for you.

649
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.803
If you want help getting back
on track. give us a call.

650
00:47:43.803 --> 00:47:44.886
913-385-19...

651
00:47:54.136 --> 00:47:56.240
- Special Agent Driskell?

652
00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.210
Kershaw.

653
00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:58.960
- Cortez.

654
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.860
- Aren't you gonna offer us a
cup of coffee there. Johnny?

655
00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.313
- Cute place.

656
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:19.920
- Sometimes you get what you get.

657
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:30.763
So. to what do I owe
the pleasure. gentlemen?

658
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:39.560
- They want this thing
for bio-molecular testing.

659
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.393
- What?

660
00:48:40.393 --> 00:48:41.320
Who's they?

661
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.010
- We received some intel from our asset

662
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:46.210
within the black market
pharmaceutical industry.

663
00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:50.750
They do some very disturbing
cross-genome experiments.

664
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:54.513
They want to combine
Bigfoot DNA with human DNA.

665
00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:59.070
We believe they want to
create some kind of a hybrid

666
00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:01.240
that they can use as a weapon.

667
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:02.073
- Really.

668
00:49:03.146 --> 00:49:05.700
- The only thing they
need now is the creature.

669
00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:08.540
That thing is worth a ridiculous
amount of money to them.

670
00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.060
- We. on the other hand.
cannot allow that to happen.

671
00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:15.610
- Agent Cortez. we believe
that your unit is compromised.

672
00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:16.480
- No way.

673
00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:17.940
We may be young. but we are not-

674
00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.920
- We need to dry clean
your whole operation.

675
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.370
Pack a bag.

676
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:25.070
We're flying back to the
puzzle palace for briefing.

677
00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:26.660
- Wheels up in 40.

678
00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:28.911
- It's kind of a bad time. sir.

679
00:49:28.911 --> 00:49:30.411
- Isn't it always?

680
00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:39.855
(gun clicks)

681
00:49:39.855 --> 00:49:43.718
(gunshots banging)
(agents grunting)

682
00:49:43.718 --> 00:49:46.135
(gun clicks)

683
00:50:38.427 --> 00:50:41.177
(birds chirping)

684
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:18.543
- Really?

685
00:51:20.774 --> 00:51:21.920
At least you ate one.

686
00:53:52.517 --> 00:53:55.267
(Bigfoot growls)

687
00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:47.777
(fish sizzling)

688
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:51.900
(birds chirping)

689
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.350
- What are these. witnesses?

690
00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:00.300
- Need to know.

691
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.523
Just bring them in and I'll
speak with them promptly.

692
00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:04.753
- Yes. sir.

693
00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.040
- Let's get something clear.

694
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.143
This is my world.

695
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:13.260
You live in the shadows. I am the shadows.

696
00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.860
Don't ask me any more questions.

697
00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:17.533
- Yes. sir.

698
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:22.030
- We have a leak.

699
00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:22.923
Talk to no one.

700
00:56:45.164 --> 00:56:46.800
(camera beeps)

701
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.050
- Okay. Mr. Ravish.

702
00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:49.260
Camera's rolling.

703
00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.093
Go ahead.

704
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:54.323
- Well. I'd say it was
about almost a year ago now.

705
00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.073
I saw this bright light
hovering over my pasture.

706
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.740
It was just there for a few
seconds. then it was gone.

707
00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.580
I started to walk out there.

708
00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:09.490
About halfway across the
pasture. there I saw it.

709
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:11.530
standing in the tree line.

710
00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:12.363
- What was it?

711
00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:17.900
- Well. it was a seven.
eight foot tall hairy man.

712
00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:18.900
looking right at me.

713
00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:23.093
Before I could raise my
shotgun. it was gone.

714
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.340
- Holy shit.

715
00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.390
- That's what I said.

716
00:57:27.803 --> 00:57:28.873
- It just ran away?

717
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.578
- I didn't see it runaway.

718
00:57:32.578 --> 00:57:33.828
It was just gone.

719
00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:37.260
- Do you think it was an alien?

720
00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:38.260
- I didn't say that.

721
00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:40.650
- Well. I mean. I just thought. you know.

722
00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:43.700
maybe because you thought you saw a UFO.

723
00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:46.270
and you basically
described seeing Bigfoot.

724
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:49.470
maybe there was like a
correlation between the two.

725
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:51.823
- Those are your words. not mine.

726
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:53.957
I just know what I saw.

727
00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:34.491
(phone buzzes)

728
00:59:28.649 --> 00:59:30.650
- [Both] Shit's getting crazy.

729
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.160
- You know about Driskell and Kershaw?

730
00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.380
- No. what happened?

731
00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:36.510
- They were found in Cortez's crash pad.

732
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:37.893
dead from lead poisoning.

733
00:59:38.893 --> 00:59:39.943
- Are you kidding me?

734
00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.300
Kershaw recruited me.

735
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:43.970
He's like a father to me.

736
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:45.640
- Yeah. he was one of the good ones.

737
00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.610
- No way. Cortez?

738
00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:48.443
Yeah.

739
00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:51.260
- He's been bought and paid for

740
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:53.240
by a black market pharmaceutical company

741
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:56.023
that wants big foot DNA
to do some crazy shit.

742
00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:59.970
Wait. what were you gonna say?

743
01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.753
- Nothing.

744
01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.350
- Don't do me like that. Garrett.

745
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.973
- Judith. listen.

746
01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:11.150
An old friend of my dad's
from the border patrol

747
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.870
went down to the restricted
area to hunt the creature.

748
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:15.320
Okay?

749
01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.330
He said he saw one in
one of his trail cameras

750
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:20.010
and he thought maybe it was the reason why

751
01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:22.810
his livestock was disappearing.

752
01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:24.660
I tried to convince him to stay away.

753
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:29.173
Yeah. now Cortez knows he's out there.

754
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.090
- This is not good.

755
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:33.470
- No. it's not.

756
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:35.330
- I'm due back in DC.

757
01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:36.283
You stay alive.

758
01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.693
- Shit. this can't be good.

759
01:01:14.407 --> 01:01:17.074
(phone buzzing)

760
01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.890
Hey.

761
01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:22.200
- [Landon] Where are you?

762
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:24.140
- Just tracked this thing
to the edge of the woods.

763
01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.500
It's going into like an old warehouse.

764
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.780
- Jesus.

765
01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.960
Listen. our lead agent Cortez
is corrupt. and lethal.

766
01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.470
He knows you're out there.

767
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:34.830
- [Dante] Corrupt. what do you mean. how?

768
01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:36.310
- If I say another word. I'm gonna end up

769
01:01:36.310 --> 01:01:38.200
in a roadside ditch. just...

770
01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.160
Knowing him. he's probably
tracking your phone right now.

771
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.880
which means you're
leading him right to it.

772
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.713
- Shit.

773
01:01:43.713 --> 01:01:44.658
Roger. that

774
01:01:44.658 --> 01:01:46.408
- [Landon] Careful...

775
01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.360
- Did you get your haircut?

776
01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:50.850
- Mm-hmm.

777
01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:53.330
I needed to get a little
cut off. do you like it?

778
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:54.980
- It looks nice.

779
01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.750
- And what's new with you?

780
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.380
- Not much.

781
01:01:58.380 --> 01:01:59.499
Work's starting to pick back up.

782
01:01:59.499 --> 01:02:00.543
- That's good.

783
01:02:02.067 --> 01:02:03.223
Are you okay?

784
01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:07.030
You've been acting a little distracted.

785
01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:08.873
- Yeah. I don't know.

786
01:02:08.873 --> 01:02:11.093
Dante's been acting a little weird lately.

787
01:02:13.078 --> 01:02:16.258
(phone buzzing)

788
01:02:16.258 --> 01:02:17.823
- Speak of the devil.

789
01:02:17.823 --> 01:02:19.635
(phone line ringing)

790
01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:20.468
Hey.

791
01:02:20.468 --> 01:02:21.920
- Brooke. listen. I need
you to get your parents

792
01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.170
and get out of the house.

793
01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.590
- What?

794
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:29.786
- Just do it. promise me.

795
01:02:29.786 --> 01:02:33.050
(gunshot bangs)

796
01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:34.063
- Somebody's here.

797
01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.515
(gunshot bangs)

798
01:02:39.515 --> 01:02:40.348
- Shit.

799
01:03:10.739 --> 01:03:13.572
(door slams open)

800
01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:36.893
- Brooke.

801
01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:41.793
Mr and Mrs. Jensen.

802
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.697
We're just here to talk for a minute.

803
01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.353
- It's clear.

804
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.443
- Shit.

805
01:05:14.571 --> 01:05:16.904
(man sighs)

806
01:05:22.212 --> 01:05:23.892
(engine rumbling)

807
01:05:23.892 --> 01:05:26.475
(engine stops)

808
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:28.660
- Is that all he said?

809
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.833
- Yeah. basically.

810
01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:33.460
- I knew this was some next level shit.

811
01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:34.293
- Mom.

812
01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.363
- Will you two please calm down?

813
01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:47.903
- Hey.

814
01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:51.050
Don't worry.

815
01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:53.613
Dante can handle anything out there.

816
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:57.320
- Oh.

817
01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.153
Bigfoot.

818
01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.613
You really do smell like death. (coughs)

819
01:07:36.436 --> 01:07:40.103
(Bigfoot breathing heavily)

820
01:07:55.177 --> 01:07:58.094
(Bigfoot growling)

821
01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:03.910
- Thanks for the fish.

822
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:09.153
I know you only came out
here to protect your family.

823
01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.453
You need to get back into the woods.

824
01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:20.130
You probably don't
understand a word I'm saying.

825
01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:21.540
- [Cortez] Dante!

826
01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:22.583
I'm coming for you!

827
01:08:39.128 --> 01:08:42.480
(gunshot bangs)

828
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.610
- Oh shit.

829
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:44.670
You shot at one of our own.

830
01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:45.503
- Yeah?

831
01:08:45.503 --> 01:08:46.960
Well he's a POS.

832
01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.483
Just a warning shot anyway.

833
01:08:51.021 --> 01:08:52.500
- You know warning shots
are against policy.

834
01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:53.430
- Really?

835
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:55.166
That's what you're worried about?

836
01:08:55.166 --> 01:08:58.083
(gunshots banging)

837
01:09:20.463 --> 01:09:22.755
(Bigfoot breathing heavily)

838
01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:25.993
- Well done.

839
01:09:28.730 --> 01:09:30.820
This thing's bigger
than you and me. Dante.

840
01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:31.763
- Yeah. I know.

841
01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.260
I saw it.

842
01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.180
It's massive.

843
01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.070
- That's not what I meant.

844
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:37.270
- I know what you meant.

845
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.943
- That's funny.

846
01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:44.370
Hell of a thing. hunting
a beast like this. huh?

847
01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:46.533
- Not really.

848
01:09:49.181 --> 01:09:51.848
(gunshot bangs)

849
01:10:05.099 --> 01:10:07.180
- You okay?
- I'm good to go.

850
01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:08.013
Who are you?

851
01:10:08.013 --> 01:10:09.210
- I'm Agent Hutchins.

852
01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:10.103
This is Smith.

853
01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:12.640
- Cortez was our boss.

854
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.618
- Before he crossed the line.

855
01:10:14.618 --> 01:10:15.680
- What line is that?

856
01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:19.320
- In this business. it's gray sometimes.

857
01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320
- But he crossed it.

858
01:10:22.527 --> 01:10:25.960
(sirens wailing)

859
01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.280
- I'll take the heat.

860
01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.640
- No way.

861
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.030
You need to get outta here.

862
01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:31.153
You never saw us.

863
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:33.093
We never met you.

864
01:10:34.143 --> 01:10:36.643
(eerie loud growl)

865
01:10:38.407 --> 01:10:41.324
(Bigfoot growling)

866
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:46.800
- Okay. That just happened.

867
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.000
- I didn't see anything.

868
01:10:55.535 --> 01:10:57.265
- Me either.

869
01:10:57.265 --> 01:11:01.982
(eerie distant howl)

870
01:11:15.221 --> 01:11:18.138
(Bigfoot growling)

871
01:11:19.026 --> 01:11:20.600
- No no no no no.

872
01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.433
Shit.

873
01:11:22.431 --> 01:11:23.264
Shit.

874
01:11:33.186 --> 01:11:36.103
(insects chirping)

875
01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:49.040
- Little on the small side.
don't you think. Carl?

876
01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.270
- Yeah. I don't think we'll get much more

877
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:54.157
than 30 bucks for these scrawny suckers.

878
01:11:54.157 --> 01:11:55.140
- You know. we're running out of critters

879
01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.970
to poach around here.

880
01:11:58.090 --> 01:12:01.040
- Yeah. Barlow. we might
have to get ourselves

881
01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.457
an honest job.

882
01:12:02.457 --> 01:12:04.122
(both laughing)

883
01:12:04.122 --> 01:12:07.440
(man shushing)

884
01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.190
What is it with you and tomatoes?

885
01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:12.284
- You ain't heard?

886
01:12:12.284 --> 01:12:13.320
- No.

887
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.890
Full of Lycopene

888
01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:16.030
What is that?

889
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:18.280
- It's essential to prostate health.

890
01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.300
- You think I'm gonna
give you a prostate exam.

891
01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.640
you out your damn mind.

892
01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:22.890
Let's go get these goats.

893
01:12:35.165 --> 01:12:37.109
(Bigfoot breathing heavily)

894
01:12:37.109 --> 01:12:39.942
(Bigfoot roaring)

895
01:12:42.325 --> 01:12:44.825
(eerie distant howl)

896
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:49.146
(Distant Bigfoot growling)

897
01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.423
- Hey Pops.

898
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.327
Is that the hairy man?

899
01:12:57.190 --> 01:12:59.306
- You better believe it.

900
01:12:59.306 --> 01:13:01.973
(tense echoing)

901
01:13:09.026 --> 01:13:11.693
(water flowing)

902
01:13:30.267 --> 01:13:33.017
(birds chirping)

903
01:13:42.464 --> 01:13:43.297
- Morning.

904
01:13:44.516 --> 01:13:46.433
- Smells good out here.

905
01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:01.533
You're amazing.
- You are.

906
01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:07.580
- You already went fishing?

907
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:09.383
- No.

908
01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.290
- Sure is nice to have
friends out here. huh?

909
01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.560

01:14:46.964 --> 01:14:51.964
