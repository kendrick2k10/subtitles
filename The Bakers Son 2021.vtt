365
00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.667
[Walt]
Uh. yeah. That's right.

366
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.734
Mrs. Dean's brought the whole
company out from Seattle

367
00:15:13.867 --> 00:15:15.934
to rehearse
a brand-new world premiere.

368
00:15:16.066 --> 00:15:17.900
I'd say that's worth
a few minutes on your broadcast.

369
00:15:18.033 --> 00:15:18.900
Hello?

370
00:15:19.033 --> 00:15:20.934
[sighs]

371
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.433
[♪♪]

372
00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:37.867
Thank you. Come.

373
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.066
Tch-tch. Good boy!

374
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.734
Yes. you're a good boy.

375
00:15:40.867 --> 00:15:41.934
Welcome back to Windward.
Mrs. Dean.

376
00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:42.934
Oh. hello. Walter.

377
00:15:43.066 --> 00:15:44.266
Nice to see you.

378
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.567
I was just thinking.

379
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.033
I know how much
you love Windward.

380
00:15:48.166 --> 00:15:50.000
and right now
we could really use

381
00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:52.600
a little publicity
to help boost tourism.

382
00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:55.333
Ah. and a world-class
ballet company in rehearsal

383
00:15:55.467 --> 00:15:56.934
might generate that coverage?

384
00:15:57.066 --> 00:15:59.400
You are as perceptive
as you are lovely.

385
00:15:59.533 --> 00:16:01.000
[chuckles]
Thank you. Walter.

386
00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:03.667
but you don't need to work
quite that hard.

387
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.000
I'll make a few phone calls
and see what I can do.

388
00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:07.200
Well. you're a blessing
to us all.

389
00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:12.000
Ah. let's not elevate me
to sainthood just yet. Walter.

391
00:16:18.233 --> 00:16:20.166

B onjour!

394
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.800
You're very cute.

395
00:16:24.934 --> 00:16:26.834
Hmm? Oh!

396
00:16:26.967 --> 00:16:29.233
Who do you belong to. hein?

397
00:16:29.367 --> 00:16:30.133
[Kathryn calling]
Rudy!

398
00:16:30.266 --> 00:16:31.667
Rudy?

399
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.934
Oh. mystery solved.
Over here!

400
00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:35.900
[Kathryn] Oh!

401
00:16:36.033 --> 00:16:37.633
Ahh!

402
00:16:37.767 --> 00:16:39.734
Rudy. there you are.

403
00:16:39.867 --> 00:16:42.000
You shouldn't have run away.
you bad dog.

404
00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:44.100
I think he was hungry.

405
00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:45.100
Oh. you didn't feed him.
did you?

406
00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:46.800
I don't like him begging.

407
00:16:46.934 --> 00:16:48.233
It's a terrible habit.

408
00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:50.967
In France. we let them sit
at the table with us.

409
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.500
Even in restaurants.

410
00:16:52.633 --> 00:16:54.934
Happy dog. happy people. hein?

411
00:16:55.066 --> 00:16:56.767
Well. we're not in France now.

412
00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.667
Rudy? Rudy!

413
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.133
Come!

414
00:17:02.266 --> 00:17:03.467
You'd better go.

415
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.033
Come! Rudy. come.

416
00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:06.800
Thank you.

417
00:17:06.934 --> 00:17:08.633
All right. Rudy.
Come on. Rudy.

418
00:17:08.767 --> 00:17:10.467
[sighs]

419
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.233
You're welcome.

[sighs]

421
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.200
So. that's another hamburger--
plain. no bun. no fries--

422
00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:21.633
and a water.

423
00:17:21.767 --> 00:17:23.367
-Yes.
-All right.

424
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.934
Let me guess. Same?

425
00:17:27.367 --> 00:17:29.400
Actually. I will have
a burger with bun

426
00:17:29.533 --> 00:17:30.734
and cheese.

427
00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:31.967
fries. crispy.

428
00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:34.467
and a... chocolate malted.

429
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.467
[scoffs]

430
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.967
What?

431
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.166
I'm the boss.

432
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.500
I get to eat what I like.

433
00:17:39.633 --> 00:17:41.233
Fantastic.

434
00:17:41.367 --> 00:17:43.734
And now I can pay
my electric bill.

435
00:17:43.867 --> 00:17:45.867
So you own
this charming establishment?

436
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.300
Oh. I own a whole chain--

437
00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:48.266
South America. Europe.

438
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.400
next week.
I'm opening one in Shanghai.

439
00:17:50.533 --> 00:17:52.633
Well. mice to know.
wherever I am in the world.

440
00:17:52.767 --> 00:17:54.166
I'll never be far from you.

441
00:17:55.633 --> 00:17:58.066
Right.
I will just get this going.

442
00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:01.767
I know that look in your eye.

443
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.367
but I have a feeling

444
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.467
she's too smart

445
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.567
to fall for the Philip Chandler
dance routine.

446
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.300
Mm-hmm.
You might be right.

447
00:18:10.433 --> 00:18:13.200
Which is exactly
what I find so interesting.

448
00:18:13.333 --> 00:18:14.633
Hey. Annie.

449
00:18:14.767 --> 00:18:16.533
-Hi.
-Can I get a turkey sandwich?

450
00:18:16.667 --> 00:18:19.233
In a sec. Cook's out sick.
I'm still short a waitress.

451
00:18:19.367 --> 00:18:21.867
and this is as close to packed
as I've been in a while.

452
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.333
No problem. I can wait.

to her again. aren't you?

458
00:18:37.734 --> 00:18:39.233
Okay. yes.

460
00:18:40.433 --> 00:18:41.934
I'm just not sure about what.

461
00:18:42.066 --> 00:18:44.934
I've already made it very clear
I know nothing about ballet.

462
00:18:45.066 --> 00:18:47.033
so I think it's a little
too late for Google.

463
00:18:47.166 --> 00:18:48.967
Well. you could talk about
how great my food is.

464
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.900
Oh. ho. You're not even
trying to help. are you?

465
00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:53.567
Sorry. Little busy.

466
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.200
You're gonna have to figure
this one out on your own.

467
00:18:55.333 --> 00:18:56.233
Okay. fine.

468
00:18:58.867 --> 00:19:00.433
[exhales]
I can do this.

469
00:19:00.567 --> 00:19:01.467
You can do this.

470
00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.400
-All right.
-Yeah.

471
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.300
If you're looking for anything
after the Beatles broke up.

472
00:19:09.433 --> 00:19:10.266
you're gonna be disappointed.

473
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.800

You just saved me a quarter.

474
00:19:12.934 --> 00:19:14.834
My pleasure.

475
00:19:17.967 --> 00:19:20.867
So. the food here--
pretty good.

476
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Glad to hear it.

477
00:19:24.467 --> 00:19:26.367
Okay. then.

478
00:19:29.967 --> 00:19:32.033

you're enjoying this?

00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:42.300
Please. I'm your best friend.

find you out here.

Shouldn't you be taking bread
out of the oven?

486
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.767
I already did.
It's cooling.

487

See you haven't given up
on that painting yet.

I can never tell.

What do you think?

Be honest.

Could you bring it
a little bit closer?

You're not gonna
fall off the dock. Matt.

Someday. you're gonna
have to explain to me

why you choose to spend
your whole life

502
00:20:37.633 --> 00:20:38.834
surrounded by something
you're afraid of.

503
00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:40.700
Okay. well. let's put
a pin in that

504
00:20:40.834 --> 00:20:41.800
until the next time
you bring it up?

505
00:20:42.967 --> 00:20:44.934
I need your help
with something.

506
00:20:45.066 --> 00:20:46.734
Sure.

507
00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:50.200
Okay. right. So. um...

Say you were interested
in someone.

00:20:57.967 --> 00:20:59.834
how would you go about that?

512
00:21:01.133 --> 00:21:02.333
Wow!

513
00:21:02.467 --> 00:21:04.600
I've never seen you
so unsure of yourself.

514
00:21:05.633 --> 00:21:08.200
It's just we come from
such different places.

515
00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.834
You know. she's got a career

516
00:21:09.967 --> 00:21:11.166
that's probably taken her
all over the world.

517
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.066
I don't even own a passport.

518
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.333

519
00:21:14.467 --> 00:21:15.767
And you want me
to be your dating coach?

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.900
Yeah.

521
00:21:18.367 --> 00:21:20.000
Annie. you're the smartest
person I know.

522
00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:22.133
And the most sophisticated.

523
00:21:23.567 --> 00:21:24.433
I mean. come on!

524
00:21:24.567 --> 00:21:26.100
I've already put my foot
in my mouth twice.

525
00:21:26.233 --> 00:21:27.300
If I'm lucky.
I've only got one more shot.

526
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.166
Okay.

527
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.600
Well. I'm not sure
what kind of help I can be.

528
00:21:32.734 --> 00:21:33.800
because. you know.
I haven't dated anybody

529
00:21:33.934 --> 00:21:36.867
since that stockbroker
from Seattle two summers ago.

530
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.367
Besides. I don't know
anything about this dancer.

531
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.100
what she's looking for
in a guy.

532
00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:42.900
Well. what would you look for?

533
00:21:43.033 --> 00:21:44.433
What would I look for?

534
00:21:44.567 --> 00:21:45.500
Yeah.

535
00:21:45.633 --> 00:21:46.667
I don't know.

536
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.500
How about everything
that stockbroker didn't have--

537
00:21:48.633 --> 00:21:50.533
depth. honesty.

538
00:21:50.667 --> 00:21:52.900
the willingness to actually
give something of himself.

539
00:21:53.033 --> 00:21:54.500
You could try
offering her that.

540
00:21:54.633 --> 00:21:56.433
Geez. Annie. we just met.

541
00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:57.934
Haven't had a real conversation
with her yet.

Can we start with something. uh.
a little simpler?

543
00:22:00.633 --> 00:22:01.934
Something simpler?

544
00:22:02.066 --> 00:22:05.166
Um. I don't know.
you could try baking for her.

545
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.400
Bet she'd kill
for a carbohydrate.

546

I think.

to give something of myself.

completely honest with you

563
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.667
About what?

564
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.100
The Nutcracker isn't
the only ballet I've ever seen.

565
00:23:11.233 --> 00:23:12.467
Really?

566
00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.967
I saw you dance.

567
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.333
In Seattle?

568
00:23:15.467 --> 00:23:17.367
No. here. the other day.

569

As good
as The Nutcracker?

573
00:23:27.633 --> 00:23:29.633
Okay. I'm no expert
or anything.

575
00:23:31.133 --> 00:23:33.000

578
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.367
like the time slowed down. okay?

579
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.700
I'm so sorry.
I'm not saying it right at all.

580
00:23:40.834 --> 00:23:43.066
Actually.
you were doing just fine.

581
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.834

582
00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:47.400

583
00:23:48.767 --> 00:23:49.600
So how 'bout that baguette?

584
00:23:49.734 --> 00:23:51.300
Oh. my goodness. I can't!

585
00:23:51.433 --> 00:23:53.033
Okay. okay. no. I understand.

586
00:23:53.166 --> 00:23:54.266
Dancers need to be disciplined.

587
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.867
and treats have to be
very special.

588
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.100

I think it's... bread.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.700
So there's nothing
special about it?

Maybe it's because you're still
doing it for the wrong reason.

the best of yourself in it.

you're the one who told me
that I should do it

Come on in. Uh...

00:31:19.166 --> 00:31:20.266
um. heh...

728
00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.533
so I had a nicer presentation
set up for you yesterday.

729
00:31:24.667 --> 00:31:28.233
Well. I need this more today
than I needed it yesterday. so.

730
00:31:28.367 --> 00:31:30.834
I'm not entirely sure
what that means.

731
00:31:30.967 --> 00:31:32.600
but I'm glad you're here.

732
00:31:35.567 --> 00:31:37.400
Oh. One moment.
s'il vous plaît.

733
00:31:37.533 --> 00:31:40.033
Hmm.

734
00:31:40.166 --> 00:31:41.166
Lucky you...

735
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.300
still warm.

736
00:31:44.633 --> 00:31:45.834
Mm.

00:31:45.967 --> 00:31:47.133
Oh!

00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.400
Also better yesterday.

740
00:31:53.533 --> 00:31:55.767
Well. you're getting
more points by the minute.

741
00:32:12.233 --> 00:32:13.467
Oh... wow.

742
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.433
Oh. wow!

743
00:32:21.567 --> 00:32:23.767

You sound surprised.

[crust crunching]

745
00:32:24.834 --> 00:32:26.834
Okay. if I'm being
completely honest.

746
00:32:26.967 --> 00:32:29.500
I don't think I've ever made
anything this good before.

747
00:32:29.633 --> 00:32:32.233
I mean. my bread's
usually. uh. okay.

748
00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:35.567
but this is like. uh...

749
00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.934
like I was inspired.

750
00:32:37.066 --> 00:32:38.266
[laughs] Oh...

751
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.066
Sure. Okay.

752
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.500
All right. I know that sounds
like a line.

753
00:32:41.633 --> 00:32:42.633
but if it was.

754
00:32:42.767 --> 00:32:44.000
I think I'd probably come up

755
00:32:44.133 --> 00:32:45.266
with something
a little bit better

756
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.233
than admitting
I'm usually mediocre.

00:32:47.367 --> 00:32:48.867

758
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.367

You are a genius.

767
00:33:29.934 --> 00:33:30.834
It totally worked.

768
00:33:30.967 --> 00:33:31.867
What worked?

769
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.333
Everything!

770
00:33:33.467 --> 00:33:35.300
I have never made bread
this good in my life.

771
00:33:35.433 --> 00:33:37.133
She loved it.

772
00:33:37.266 --> 00:33:39.333
And then I told her
I never made bread that good.

773
00:33:39.467 --> 00:33:40.867
I was completely honest.

774
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.066
and she loved that. too.

775
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.533
Here. try it.

776
00:33:44.667 --> 00:33:47.467
Matt. I'm kind of
in the middle of things here.

777
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.800
Come on.

778
00:33:48.934 --> 00:33:51.200
Come on. just one bite.

779
00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:53.266
All right.
All right. all right.

780
00:33:56.967 --> 00:33:58.300
You can taste it. too.
can't you?

781
00:33:58.433 --> 00:34:00.800
Oh. wow.

782
00:34:02.266 --> 00:34:04.233
Lyle-- try that.

783
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.266
Oh. this is good!

784
00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.400
I know. There's something
different about it.

785
00:34:12.533 --> 00:34:13.400
something better.

786
00:34:13.533 --> 00:34:15.567
And I couldn't have
done it without you.

787
00:34:17.266 --> 00:34:19.300
[astonished chuckle]

788
00:34:19.433 --> 00:34:21.000
You smell nice.
What is that?

Shampoo.

790
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.100
I like it.

791
00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.900
This is really good.

792
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.900

Hey. Walt.

797
00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:52.800
So. I'm doing a little survey.

798
00:34:52.934 --> 00:34:54.266
-Try one of these.
-In a sec.

799
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.734
How does this sound to you?

800
00:34:55.867 --> 00:34:57.934
A "Pioneer Days" festival.

The entire town
in period-day costume.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.266
and you. you handsome devil.

the island's founder.
Captain Bodie.

804
00:35:04.967 --> 00:35:06.166
Tourists will eat it up.

805
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.800
No.

806
00:35:07.934 --> 00:35:09.133
Come on. you'd be great.

807
00:35:09.266 --> 00:35:10.500
I don't do costumes.

808
00:35:10.633 --> 00:35:13.200
And besides. Walt.
you are the star

809
00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:15.100
of the local community theater
every year.

810
00:35:15.233 --> 00:35:16.166
You should do it.

811
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.934
I don't look good
in knee breeches.

812
00:35:18.066 --> 00:35:19.700
Small calves.

813
00:35:19.834 --> 00:35:21.100
It's hereditary.

814
00:35:21.233 --> 00:35:23.133
My heart goes out to you.

815
00:35:23.266 --> 00:35:24.333
Now try the bread.

816
00:35:24.467 --> 00:35:25.867
Just think about it.

817
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.433
We gotta come up
with something

818
00:35:27.567 --> 00:35:29.000
to get the tourists back here.

819
00:35:29.133 --> 00:35:30.333
Ask Lyle.

820
00:35:30.467 --> 00:35:32.467
All that bike riding.
He's got amazing calves.

821
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.667
I did. He said no.

822
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.266
You were my second choice.

823
00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.066
Well. third.

824
00:35:38.934 --> 00:35:40.000
So?

825
00:35:40.133 --> 00:35:41.433
This is incredible.

826
00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:42.934
Yes!

00:35:43.066 --> 00:35:44.767
Four out of four!

828
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:46.000
Thanks. Walt!

829
00:35:46.133 --> 00:35:47.166
Mm-hmm!

830
00:35:51.633 --> 00:35:54.166
So. are you going to tell me
where we're going?

831
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.667
Well. it's a beautiful day.

832
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.734
I thought I'd show you

833
00:35:56.867 --> 00:35:58.867
some of my favorite places
around the island.

834
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.567
Okay.

835
00:36:01.834 --> 00:36:03.333
Your chariot awaits.

836
00:36:03.467 --> 00:36:04.300
Thank you.

837
00:36:06.367 --> 00:36:07.333
Hello?

838
00:36:07.467 --> 00:36:08.400
Hi.

839
00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:09.700
You know. I'm sorry.

840
00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:11.767
We're actually closed.

841
00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.667
but. um. Barnacle Burt's
is open--

842
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.900
I pray that I'm never so hungry

843
00:36:17.033 --> 00:36:19.033
to eat at a place
called Barnacle Burt's.

844
00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:22.233
I was actually on my way
to the far more fashionable

845
00:36:22.367 --> 00:36:23.900
Bartholomew's Public House.

846
00:36:24.033 --> 00:36:25.767
and wondered
if you'd care to join me.

847
00:36:27.467 --> 00:36:29.066
Oh. Um...

848
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.033
thanks.

849
00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:31.867
You know. but it's just--
it's been a--

850
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.767
Before you say no.
you should be aware.

851
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.700
I'm a world-renowned
choreographer

852
00:36:36.834 --> 00:36:39.834
with a huge. yet fragile. ego.

853
00:36:39.967 --> 00:36:42.233
Rejection may depress me so much
I can't create.

854
00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:45.934
and that. well. that would make
the world a sadder place.

[snickers]

856
00:36:50.467 --> 00:36:52.900
Well. I certainly wouldn't want
to be responsible for that.

857
00:36:53.033 --> 00:36:54.166
Excellent!

858
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.266
All right.

[background music plays]

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.266
So. I mean. I was 23.

865
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.133
My ballet was the biggest thing
in Paris.

866
00:37:32.266 --> 00:37:34.233
And there's nothing like
success in Paris.

867
00:37:34.367 --> 00:37:35.934
What a city.

868
00:37:36.066 --> 00:37:37.200
I know.

869
00:37:37.333 --> 00:37:38.400
I studied painting for a year

870
00:37:38.533 --> 00:37:40.266
at the Ecole Nationale
Supérieure des Beaux-Arts.

871
00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.433
No way.

872
00:37:42.567 --> 00:37:44.300
Well. you just continue
to impress me.

873
00:37:44.433 --> 00:37:45.633
[laughs]

874
00:37:45.767 --> 00:37:47.700
Merci. Vous êtes très gentil.

875
00:37:47.834 --> 00:37:51.266
So how does a budding artist
with an excellent French accent

876
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.200
end up owning
a restaurant here?

877
00:37:53.333 --> 00:37:55.233
It was my parents' place.

878
00:37:55.367 --> 00:37:58.100
And after my father got sick.
I came back to help.

879
00:37:58.233 --> 00:37:59.633
and I never got back to Paris.

880
00:37:59.767 --> 00:38:02.033
And your painting?

881
00:38:02.166 --> 00:38:04.500
I still dabble a little.

882
00:38:04.633 --> 00:38:07.000
There's not a lot of
creative satisfaction

883
00:38:07.133 --> 00:38:10.266
in ordering
cases of frozen hamburger--

884
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.433
-[both laughing]
-...and cases of ketchup.

885
00:38:12.567 --> 00:38:14.500
so it's nice to have an outlet.

886
00:38:14.633 --> 00:38:15.633
Have you ever had a showing?

887
00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.133
Only on the walls of my house.

888
00:38:19.266 --> 00:38:21.433
It seems the life of an artist

889
00:38:21.567 --> 00:38:23.166
was not something
I was meant to have.

890
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.333
Well. you know.
it's never too late.

891
00:38:25.467 --> 00:38:27.300
Wouldn't it be nice
if that were true?

892
00:38:27.433 --> 00:38:29.133
I'm sorry.

00:38:29.266 --> 00:38:31.800

brought down the mood.

No.

00:38:34.433 --> 00:38:36.567
Let me see
if I can fix that.

00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:41.800
How could I say no

899

900
00:38:43.567 --> 00:38:45.033

in meaningful relationships.

five words to him.

where my life is right now.

00:46:34.934 --> 00:46:36.266
-That good?
-Oh. ho.

1086
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.900
I know I must seem
full of myself--

1087
00:46:38.033 --> 00:46:40.734
and I am.
but you can judge for yourself.

1088
00:46:40.867 --> 00:46:43.100
I've convinced Mrs. Dean
to invite the whole town

1089
00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:44.734
to our final rehearsal.

1090
00:46:44.867 --> 00:46:45.834
You have to come.

1091
00:46:45.967 --> 00:46:47.500
Sure.

1092
00:46:47.633 --> 00:46:48.600
Great.

1093
00:46:48.734 --> 00:46:50.000
After you.

1094
00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.166
Do you want
to take me out tonight?

1095
00:46:59.767 --> 00:47:00.900
[taken aback] Okay.

1096
00:47:01.033 --> 00:47:02.700
Okay.

1097
00:47:02.834 --> 00:47:04.066
-[Annie chuckles]
-Great.

1098
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.900
Great.

1099
00:47:07.533 --> 00:47:09.300
Hey. Annie.
can we get two burgers--

1100
00:47:09.433 --> 00:47:11.734
I'm sorry. kitchen's closed.

1101
00:47:11.867 --> 00:47:13.233
Again?

1102
00:47:13.367 --> 00:47:15.300
Yeah. I got to get
this place cleaned up.

1103
00:47:15.433 --> 00:47:16.533
'cause I've got a date.

1104
00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:19.633
Pick me up at seven.

1105
00:47:19.767 --> 00:47:20.867
Yeah?

1106
00:47:24.033 --> 00:47:26.166
[♪♪]

1107
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.800
There's our magic baker.

1108
00:47:39.934 --> 00:47:41.200
Hey. Lyle.

1109
00:47:41.333 --> 00:47:42.467
I don't know what
you're putting in that bread.

1110
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.600
but don't stop.

1111
00:47:43.734 --> 00:47:45.700
It's the best tourist season
we've had in years.

1112
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.633
Okay. that's. what?

1113
00:47:49.767 --> 00:47:51.967
10 people who've said
you're amazing?

1114
00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.734
So. Mr. Popularity.

1115
00:47:53.867 --> 00:47:55.700
you want to take me
whale watching tomorrow?

1116
00:47:55.834 --> 00:47:59.066
I... I don't think
that's a good idea.

1117
00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.967
Why not?

1118
00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.400
Just don't do well
on small boats.

1119
00:48:03.533 --> 00:48:04.700
You get seasick?

1120
00:48:04.834 --> 00:48:06.800
Okay.

1121
00:48:06.934 --> 00:48:08.767
Embarrassing moment
about to happen.

1122
00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.333
Please don't laugh.

1123
00:48:11.533 --> 00:48:12.600
I can't swim.

1124
00:48:12.734 --> 00:48:13.800
[laughs]

1125
00:48:13.934 --> 00:48:15.900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just--

1126
00:48:16.033 --> 00:48:17.700
I know. I live on an island.

1127
00:48:17.834 --> 00:48:20.533
I always meant to learn. but...

1128
00:48:20.667 --> 00:48:22.300
But what?

1129
00:48:22.433 --> 00:48:24.567
When I was a kid.

1130
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:26.600
we took a class field trip
to Seattle.

1131
00:48:26.734 --> 00:48:29.066
and as the ferry was
pulling out of the harbor.

1132
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.133
I was showing off.

1133
00:48:31.266 --> 00:48:33.900
and I fell overboard.

1134
00:48:34.033 --> 00:48:35.433
The teacher didn't see me.

1135
00:48:35.567 --> 00:48:37.467
so Annie jumped in
and saved me.

1136
00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.934
She pulled me right there.
to that dock.

1137
00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.300
You two
certainly have a history.

1138
00:48:44.433 --> 00:48:46.667
Yeah. we do.

1139
00:48:47.867 --> 00:48:49.367
Did you two ever date?

1140
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.700
Me and Annie? No!

1141
00:48:51.834 --> 00:48:53.734
No. she is my best friend.

1142
00:48:53.867 --> 00:48:57.367
though you wouldn't know it
from the way she's been acting.

1143
00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.834
How's she been acting?

1144
00:49:00.133 --> 00:49:01.200
Irritated.

1145
00:49:01.333 --> 00:49:02.400
[scoffs]

1146
00:49:02.533 --> 00:49:06.266
Well. stop being such a guy
and ask her what's wrong.

1147
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.867
Sounds exactly like the kind
of advice I'd get from her.

1148
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.667
[laughs] Well.
the more I hear about her.

1149
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.066
the more I like her.

1150
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.333
Enough about Annie.

1151
00:49:18.467 --> 00:49:20.100
-[ice clatters]
-[Nicole gasps]

1152
00:49:20.233 --> 00:49:24.100
[laughs]
Oh. you are so smooth.

1153
00:49:24.233 --> 00:49:25.633
[both laughing]

1154
00:49:30.633 --> 00:49:32.500
Oh! [chuckles]
Thank you.

1155
00:49:33.567 --> 00:49:35.100
So...

1156
00:49:35.233 --> 00:49:37.367
we know each other
a little better now.

1157
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:40.367
How do you feel about showing me
some of those paintings?

1158
00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.967
Oh. I. uh...

1159
00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.266
Seriously. I know
some gallery owners in Seattle.

1160
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.266
I could talk to them for you.

1161
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.333
What if you don't think
they're any good?

1162
00:49:48.467 --> 00:49:50.700
Having spent just
a little bit of time with you.

1163
00:49:50.834 --> 00:49:53.734
I have a feeling that I would
like them very much.

1164
00:49:55.133 --> 00:49:58.200
That's very sweet. Philip.
but...

1165
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.266
You're not ready yet.

1166
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.667
I get it.

1167
00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.433
But if you change your mind...

1168
00:50:03.567 --> 00:50:05.467
Goodnight. Philip.

1169
00:50:08.433 --> 00:50:11.200
[♪♪]

1170
00:50:11.333 --> 00:50:14.166
[Jean Pierre] Hello.
you lovely and hungry people!

1171
00:50:15.467 --> 00:50:17.667
We open in five minutes.

1172
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.433
and I promise. it will be
well worth your wait.

1173
00:50:21.567 --> 00:50:22.533
[barks]

1174
00:50:22.667 --> 00:50:25.667
Ah. bon.
You again.

1175
00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.333
[whimpers]

1176
00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.467
Uh...

1177
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.834
come on.
you little escape artist.

1178
00:50:33.967 --> 00:50:36.333
I don't have time
to take you home right now.

1179
00:50:37.633 --> 00:50:39.533
Alors. entre. entre.

1180
00:50:40.667 --> 00:50:42.100
Bon. Arrière.

1181
00:50:42.233 --> 00:50:43.567
Viens-t'en. Viens-t'en.

1182
00:50:46.734 --> 00:50:47.767
Matthew.

1183
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.800
time to make your deliveries.

1184
00:50:50.934 --> 00:50:52.166
Right.
[grumbles wearily]

1185
00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:54.533
Thanks.

1186
00:50:54.667 --> 00:50:55.633
Who's this?

1187
00:50:58.233 --> 00:50:59.667
A new employee?

1188
00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.734
[Jean Pierre chuckles]

1189
00:51:01.867 --> 00:51:03.567
He belongs to Mrs. Dean.

1190
00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.166
You know. there's
a very pretty face

1191
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.934
under that scowl of hers.

1192
00:51:09.967 --> 00:51:10.900
So what do you think?

1193
00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.033
I think you are a baker.

1194
00:51:16.166 --> 00:51:17.800
And a very. very good one.

1195
00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.934
Well. you said I needed
to find my inspiration.

1196
00:51:22.066 --> 00:51:23.233
Guess I finally have.

1197
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:28.734
I just hope you found it
in the right place.

1198
00:51:31.834 --> 00:51:33.600
Viens-t'en.
Viens-t'en. Viens-t'en.

1199
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.166
Annie?

1200
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.266
You're not gonna believe this.

1201
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.900
but there's
a guy out there named...

1202
00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:44.567
Thompson.
who wants to know

1203
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.333
if you're interested
in selling the restaurant.

1204
00:51:46.467 --> 00:51:47.934
[laughs]

1205
00:51:48.066 --> 00:51:50.500
Where was he three months ago
when I couldn't pay a bill?

1206
00:51:50.633 --> 00:51:51.667
I'm not selling now.

1207
00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.367
[laughing]

1208
00:51:54.633 --> 00:51:56.533
[phone rings]

1209
00:51:56.667 --> 00:51:59.400
Hello. Duval's.
I'm sorry. I have to put you--

1210
00:52:00.467 --> 00:52:01.500
What?

1211
00:52:01.633 --> 00:52:04.233
Really?

1212
00:52:04.367 --> 00:52:05.500
Fantastique!

1213
00:52:05.633 --> 00:52:06.734
[laughs]

1214
00:52:06.867 --> 00:52:09.667
Yes! Yes. see you then!

1215
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.400
We are going to be
on Get Up & Go. America!

1216
00:52:12.533 --> 00:52:13.600
They want to do a story

1217
00:52:13.734 --> 00:52:16.500
on the bakery that brought
a small town back to life!

1218
00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:19.433
[cheering and applause erupt]

1219
00:52:30.533 --> 00:52:32.967
And table four's still
waiting for their fries. okay?

1220
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.667
Thank you.

1221
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.333
So... can I get
something to eat.

1222
00:52:38.467 --> 00:52:39.734
or are you closing
at two now?

1223
00:52:39.867 --> 00:52:41.166
[chuckles weakly]

1224
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.266
Come on. Annie.
I don't want to fight with you.

1225
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.500
Who's fighting?

1226
00:52:44.633 --> 00:52:46.767
Uh. we are.
and I'm not sure why.

1227
00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.834
I mean. I'm used to you
being a little cranky with me.

1228
00:52:48.967 --> 00:52:49.834
but this is worse than usual.

1229
00:52:51.033 --> 00:52:53.400
When am I cranky with you?

1230
00:52:53.533 --> 00:52:55.233
Come on. you have been
on my case since we were kids.

1231
00:52:55.367 --> 00:52:57.900
Pushing me to be something
I never thought I could be.

1232
00:52:58.033 --> 00:52:59.133
Well. guess what?

1233
00:52:59.266 --> 00:53:02.333
I finally listened to you
and now it's finally happened.

1234
00:53:02.467 --> 00:53:05.200
There's something in my bread
that wasn't there before.

1235
00:53:05.333 --> 00:53:08.400
I know it sounds crazy
and I can't explain it.

1236
00:53:08.533 --> 00:53:10.200
but I know you can taste it--
everyone can.

1237
00:53:10.333 --> 00:53:13.000
For the first time in my life.
I feel like I have a purpose.

1238
00:53:13.133 --> 00:53:15.400
Why are you telling me this?

1239
00:53:15.533 --> 00:53:17.333
Because...

1240
00:53:17.467 --> 00:53:18.900
it wouldn't have happened
without you.

1241
00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.867
I want you
to be happy for me.

1242
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.333
instead of whatever...
this is.

1243
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.567
[forced] I'm happy for you.

1244
00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.000
You've got
a weird way of showing it.

1245
00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:32.734
I'm sorry. I...

1246
00:53:32.867 --> 00:53:35.633
You know. I'm dealing
with some stuff and...

1247
00:53:35.767 --> 00:53:36.967
maybe I took it out on you.

1248
00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:38.667
Well. what kind of stuff?

1249
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:42.300
You know. restaurant stuff.
Money.

1250
00:53:42.433 --> 00:53:44.300
But now. thanks to you
and your magic bread.

1251
00:53:44.433 --> 00:53:46.200
stuff's really picking up.

1252
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:50.066
So. we're good?

1253
00:53:51.467 --> 00:53:52.900
Yeah. we're good.

1254
00:53:53.033 --> 00:53:55.000
Yeah.

1255
00:53:55.133 --> 00:53:56.066
[both chuckling]

1256
00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.100
Great. because

1257
00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:59.000
there's something
that I want to run by you.

1258
00:53:59.133 --> 00:54:00.967
something
that may surprise you.

1259
00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.800
Okay.

1260
00:54:02.934 --> 00:54:04.600
It's Nicole.

1261
00:54:04.734 --> 00:54:06.800
I-I think
I might be sort of...

1262
00:54:06.934 --> 00:54:08.400
in love with her.

1263
00:54:11.166 --> 00:54:12.433
Really?

1264
00:54:12.567 --> 00:54:14.033
Yeah. but the thing is.

1265
00:54:14.166 --> 00:54:16.133
I'm not sure
if she feels the same way.

1266
00:54:16.266 --> 00:54:17.900
I mean. she's not like
the girls I usually date.

1267
00:54:18.033 --> 00:54:20.333
She's more like. uh.
well. she's more like you.

1268
00:54:21.433 --> 00:54:22.467
Like me?

1269
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.467
Yeah.

1270
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.467
You know--
talented. smart. complicated.

[laughing]

1272
00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.567
Why is that... funny?

1273
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:35.300
I'm sorry. I...

1274
00:54:35.433 --> 00:54:36.533
[sighs]

1275
00:54:36.667 --> 00:54:38.133
I don't know why I'm laughing.

1276
00:54:38.266 --> 00:54:39.967
You know.
I don't have any idea

1277
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.433
why people fall
for the people they do.

1278
00:54:42.567 --> 00:54:44.400
If you want to know
how she feels about you.

1279
00:54:44.533 --> 00:54:47.233
you're...
you're gonna have to ask her.

1280
00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.700
I'm so new to this whole thing.

1281
00:54:49.834 --> 00:54:51.367
What if I'm not good at it?

1282
00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.400
Let me give you a hint.

1283
00:54:53.533 --> 00:54:56.800
When you tell her
that you love her.

1284
00:54:56.934 --> 00:54:58.934
you may want to lose
the "sort of."

[♪♪]

1286
00:55:10.734 --> 00:55:12.066
I knew it! I knew it!

1287
00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.133
Oh. I would have made
a great psychologist.

1288
00:55:14.266 --> 00:55:15.300
I don't know
what makes me feel worse.

1289
00:55:15.433 --> 00:55:17.734
that I'm in love with Matt
or that you were right.

1290
00:55:17.867 --> 00:55:18.834
That's besides the point.

1291
00:55:18.967 --> 00:55:21.300
Okay. what matters
is that you've admitted it.

1292
00:55:21.433 --> 00:55:23.000
No. What matters is

1293
00:55:23.133 --> 00:55:25.800
that he doesn't
feel the same way.

1294
00:55:25.934 --> 00:55:28.133
Maybe he only thinks
that he's in love with her.

1295
00:55:28.266 --> 00:55:29.400
I mean. look at you.

1296
00:55:29.533 --> 00:55:30.500
Look how long
it took you to wake up.

1297
00:55:30.633 --> 00:55:32.633
and that was with
me filling you with insights.

1298
00:55:32.767 --> 00:55:34.400
I mean. sooner or later.
he's gonna realize

1299
00:55:34.533 --> 00:55:36.000
that they're from
two different worlds.

1300
00:55:36.133 --> 00:55:37.300
Wait.

1301
00:55:37.433 --> 00:55:40.734
Do you think that Matt would
leave Windward to follow her?

1302
00:55:40.867 --> 00:55:42.934
I don't know.
You're the psychology minor.

1303
00:55:43.066 --> 00:55:45.900
True. But I'm not psychic.

1304

Come in. come in!

Oh. my sweet. sweet angel.

1310
00:55:59.367 --> 00:56:01.867
I thought
I would never see you again.

1311
00:56:04.367 --> 00:56:06.667
There you go. Rudy.

1312
00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:08.834
Thank you.

1313
00:56:08.967 --> 00:56:11.166
You can't imagine
how upset I've been.

1314
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.800
But of course.

1315
00:56:12.934 --> 00:56:15.800
I had a wonderful little dog
named Simone.

1316
00:56:15.934 --> 00:56:18.233
so I know exactly how you feel.

1317
00:56:18.367 --> 00:56:21.734
Would you like to join me
for a glass of wine?

1318
00:56:21.867 --> 00:56:23.800

And I do believe
you're blushing.

gets to see
a star in the making.

Oh! That's very kind.

1349
01:00:02.467 --> 01:00:04.266
You must be really eager

a lot to love about this place.

I don't have to tell you that!

How could I?

1360
01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:31.533

Well. I was hoping
that you'd like it.

I'm sure you're being showered
with compliments.

I'm just sorry that

1377
01:01:11.133 --> 01:01:12.500
I'm not the one you wanted
to be spending time with.

01:01:14.433 --> 01:01:15.967
I'm not sure what you mean.

1379
01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.133
Well. perhaps I'm mistaken.

how much the time here
has meant to me.

1391
01:02:05.867 --> 01:02:08.667
And I'm gonna miss this place.
and you.

There's no reason you have to.

1394
01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.867
I was thinking about it.

1395
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.567
and I could spend time with you
in Seattle.

1396
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.066
and after the ballet closes.
you could come here.

1397
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:22.667
No. After the ballet closes.
we go on a six-month tour.

1398
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.800
And then there'll be
another ballet and another tour.

1399
01:02:26.934 --> 01:02:28.200
So what are you saying?

1400
01:02:28.333 --> 01:02:29.867
You have to understand.

1401

of a career

my entire life.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.300
and right now.
there's just no place in it--

1404
01:02:37.433 --> 01:02:38.900
So this is what it's like.

1405
01:02:39.033 --> 01:02:41.000
What?

1406
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.033

to say anything else.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.834
Repeat...

1618
01:12:54.967 --> 01:12:56.367
the crow is in the nest.

1619
01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.667
Copy that.

1620
01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:03.433
[sets mug down]

1621
01:13:06.166 --> 01:13:07.567
Hey.

1622
01:13:09.667 --> 01:13:11.100
I stopped by your house.

1623
01:13:11.233 --> 01:13:13.033
I've left you
half a dozen messages.

1624
01:13:13.166 --> 01:13:15.734
It's all over town
that you sold the diner...

1625
01:13:15.867 --> 01:13:17.967
you haven't said
a word to me.

1626
01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.133
Annie?

1627
01:13:20.266 --> 01:13:21.367
What's going on?

1628
01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:24.734
It's complicated.

1629
01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:26.400
It all happened really fast.

1630
01:13:26.533 --> 01:13:27.800
-I was gonna tell you--
-And when was that gonna be?

1631
01:13:27.934 --> 01:13:29.600
In a note.
slid under my door?

1632
01:13:29.734 --> 01:13:31.433
Look. you were dealing
with your own stuff--

1633
01:13:31.567 --> 01:13:32.633
I know. but I just think--

1634
01:13:32.767 --> 01:13:34.800
We'll talk more. I promise.
but I have to answer this

1635
01:13:34.934 --> 01:13:35.967
right now. I'm sorry.

1636
01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:37.400
Hi. Mr. Thompson.

1637
01:13:38.667 --> 01:13:41.066
[♪♪]

1638
01:13:46.033 --> 01:13:47.467
[Walt] Um. one minor thing--

1639
01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.066
Yeah?

1640
01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.633
Heather. uh. Matt doesn't know
about the post that you saw.

1641
01:13:51.767 --> 01:13:53.266
Matt!

1642
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.033
What a surprise.
I'd like you to meet...

1643
01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:57.367
my... cousin. Heather.

1644
01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.367
Hi!

1645
01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.467
Hello.

1646
01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.700
Um...

1647
01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.467
Heather is visiting
for the day.

1648
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.600
Although I could stay longer.

1649
01:14:08.734 --> 01:14:10.233
That's nice.

1650
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.600
You know.

1651
01:14:13.734 --> 01:14:15.800
Heather would love
a tour of the island

1652
01:14:15.934 --> 01:14:18.667
with someone
who knows it intimately.

1653
01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.533
-Yeah.
-Well. Heather...

1654
01:14:20.667 --> 01:14:22.367
you can't do better
than Walt here.

1655
01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:25.600
I'm sorry. what?

1656
01:14:25.734 --> 01:14:27.767
Enjoy your stay.

1657
01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:29.367
[engine starts]

1658
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.100
[Heather scoffs]

1659
01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:32.200
Okay.

1660
01:14:32.333 --> 01:14:35.500
Somebody owes me $20
for a wasted ferry ride...

1661
01:14:35.633 --> 01:14:37.400
"cousin."

1662
01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.967
[pub bustles with chatter]

1663
01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:45.967
Hey. Matt. uh...

1664
01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.433
this is my cousin. Lisa.

1665
01:14:47.567 --> 01:14:49.133
Ernie tells me you bake bread.

1666
01:14:49.266 --> 01:14:51.033
Now. I have an allergy
to white flour.

1667
01:14:51.166 --> 01:14:52.834
but if you make
a nice pumpernickel.

1668
01:14:52.967 --> 01:14:54.700
I would really love to try it.

1669
01:14:54.834 --> 01:14:57.767
Sorry. Pumpernickel was never
a big seller around here.

1670
01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:00.333
You'll have better luck
in Seattle.

1671
01:15:00.467 --> 01:15:02.000
Night. Ernie.

1672
01:15:02.133 --> 01:15:04.066
Nice to meet you.

1673
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.533
Hold on!

1674
01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:07.166
Would you be okay with rye?

1675
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.433
Not really.

1676
01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:11.200
Hey. Matt.
This is my cousin. Hailey.

1677
01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:12.600
It's "Kayleigh."

1678
01:15:12.734 --> 01:15:14.667
Right! She has a twin.

1679
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.567
Can never tell them apart.

1680
01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:17.600
Amazing!

1681
01:15:17.734 --> 01:15:18.700
You know. you are

1682
01:15:18.834 --> 01:15:20.367
the eighth cousin
I met this week.

1683
01:15:21.867 --> 01:15:23.333
-Oh!
-What are the odds?

1684
01:15:23.467 --> 01:15:25.033
Oh. astronomical.

1685
01:15:25.166 --> 01:15:26.367
Bye. Kayleigh.

1686
01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.433
Are you single?

1687
01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.400
Uh... yeah.

1688
01:15:36.533 --> 01:15:37.700
Good.

1689
01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:39.300
You're taking me to lunch.

1690
01:15:41.567 --> 01:15:43.433
Are you gonna be okay?

1691
01:15:43.567 --> 01:15:45.266
If I say no.
will you stay?

1692
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.900
It's not like
I won't be back.

1693
01:15:48.033 --> 01:15:50.066
I'm an unofficial aunt.
remember?

1694
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.834
Yeah.

1695
01:15:51.967 --> 01:15:53.367
Here.

1696
01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:54.367
I'm gonna go out with you.

1697
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.367
I want to take
one last walk around town.

1698
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.767
Want me to go with you?

1699
01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:01.000
It's okay. you go home
and get some sleep.

1700
01:16:01.133 --> 01:16:02.133
I'll see you
in the morning. okay?

1701
01:16:02.266 --> 01:16:04.667
Okay.

1702
01:16:05.867 --> 01:16:07.834
[♪♪]

1703
01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.567
You know. I'm still
waiting on that talk

1704
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.400
you promised we'd have.

1705
01:16:32.533 --> 01:16:35.500
I kept meaning to come see you.
but...

1706
01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.266
guess I knew how hard
it was gonna be to say goodbye

1707
01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.900
and I was avoiding it.

1708
01:16:39.033 --> 01:16:40.567
That's okay.

1709
01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:41.900
I could've pushed it.

1710
01:16:42.033 --> 01:16:44.100
I think I was afraid
of the same thing.

1711
01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.700
I don't even know
why you decided to leave.

1712
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:54.300
I just feel like
I've gotten stuck in my life

1713
01:16:54.433 --> 01:16:56.333
and I need to do something
to change that.

1714
01:16:56.467 --> 01:16:57.900
And you can't change that here?

1715
01:16:58.033 --> 01:16:59.500
I don't think so.

1716
01:16:59.633 --> 01:17:00.767
Why not?

1717
01:17:04.133 --> 01:17:06.066
Because I...

1718
01:17:10.133 --> 01:17:11.834
Shouldn't you
be at the bakery?

1719
01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.700
Doesn't matter.

1720
01:17:14.834 --> 01:17:16.400
Nobody's buying much bread
right now. anyway.

1721
01:17:16.533 --> 01:17:17.700
I seem to have lost my touch.

1722
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.400
So you're going back
to Paris. then?

1723
01:17:21.533 --> 01:17:23.400
Yeah.

1724
01:17:23.533 --> 01:17:24.734
[laughs]

1725
01:17:24.867 --> 01:17:28.066
Finally decided
to take your advice.

1726
01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.500
My advice?

1727
01:17:29.633 --> 01:17:30.533
You've always told me

1728
01:17:30.667 --> 01:17:32.400
to believe in my ability
to paint.

1729
01:17:32.533 --> 01:17:35.200
I left before I ever found out
how good I could be.

1730
01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:37.333
I got the offer
to sell the restaurant

1731
01:17:37.467 --> 01:17:39.166
and I just thought.
"If I don't take the chance now.

1732
01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:41.166
I never will."

1733
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.600
When I said those things.

1734
01:17:42.734 --> 01:17:44.400
I didn't think
it'd mean you'd leave here.

1735
01:17:44.533 --> 01:17:46.266
Oh. you won't even notice
I'm gone.

1736
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.333
Oh. that's not true.

1737
01:17:47.467 --> 01:17:50.400
The year you were away
was really hard on me.

1738
01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.567
I missed our talks.

1739
01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:56.734
our movie nights.
just hanging out with you.

1740
01:17:56.867 --> 01:17:59.200
Letters and funny postcards
weren't enough.

1741
01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:01.133
Well. now we have FaceTime.

1742
01:18:01.266 --> 01:18:03.934
I can show you Paris
out my window.

1743
01:18:05.066 --> 01:18:08.000
You'll get busy with your art
and your new friends.

1744
01:18:08.133 --> 01:18:09.133
Before you know it.

1745
01:18:09.266 --> 01:18:11.433
you won't even
think of me anymore.

1746
01:18:11.567 --> 01:18:12.834
Everybody I care about leaves.

1747
01:18:12.967 --> 01:18:14.266
What was that?

1748
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.934
Everything isn't about you!

1749
01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:19.166
This is about me--
and what I need.

1750
01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.400
You found your passion.

1751
01:18:21.533 --> 01:18:23.834
I need the chance
to get back to mine.

1752
01:18:23.967 --> 01:18:25.633
Your bread's amazing.

1753
01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:27.467
Helped the whole town.

1754
01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.734
But just because you got hurt.
you stopped.

1755
01:18:29.867 --> 01:18:31.100
Well. that's life. Matt!

1756
01:18:31.233 --> 01:18:33.233
At some point.
we all get hurt.

1757
01:18:33.367 --> 01:18:34.300
and all you can do

1758
01:18:34.433 --> 01:18:37.133
is pick yourself up
and move on.

1759
01:18:37.266 --> 01:18:38.567
Windward's in trouble!

1760
01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:40.000
You could do something
about it.

1761
01:18:40.133 --> 01:18:42.066
It's not that simple!

1762
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.834
It doesn't work without Nicole.

1763
01:18:43.967 --> 01:18:45.567
It's not Nicole!
It's you!

1764
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.000
You did it before.

1765
01:18:47.133 --> 01:18:48.166
You could do it again.

1766
01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.767
[voice cracks] No. I can't.

1767
01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.467

1768
01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.800
Well. if that's
what you really believe.

1769
01:18:54.934 --> 01:18:56.567
then there's
nothing else to say.

1770
01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.266
After everything
we've been through.

1771
01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.467
you're just gonna walk away?

1772
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:02.633
You are the most infuriating
person I have ever met!

1773
01:19:02.767 --> 01:19:04.967
I saved you once. Matt!

1774
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.066
It's about time you learned
to sink or swim on your own.

1775
01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.000
I never asked you to save me!

1776
01:19:09.133 --> 01:19:10.500
You would've drowned
without me!

1777
01:19:10.633 --> 01:19:12.467
-You don't know that!

What about you?
