[knocking on door]

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.000
Come in!

10
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.133
Hi.

11
00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.800
Your life is a perpetual
coffee commercial.

12
00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:52.867
You know this. right?

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.900
The only thing missing

14
00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:54.834
is some guy in flannel

15
00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:56.700
coming up behind you
in a tender hug.

16
00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:57.567
and together.

17
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.166
you gaze out
at the winter landscape.

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.266
And then two minutes later.

19
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.166
we're both arguing over

20
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.166
who left the coffee ring

21
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.166
on the counter.

22
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.633
Wow. you're such a romantic.

23
00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:05.734
I know. right?

24
00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:09.066
Thank you for driving me
today.

25
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.000
Aw. you didn't have to do that.

26
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.667
You told me
that you would not drive me

27
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.166
unless I baked you something.

28
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.333
-Did I?
-Uh-huh.

29
00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:17.433
Well. I also have
a few errands to run in town.

30
00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:18.867
Plus. I'll take any excuse

31
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.066
to leave the lonely confines
of my home office.

32
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.433
Maybe Matt can start
working from home.

33
00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:24.500
you know. keep you company.

34
00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:26.100
I'd like to stay married.

35
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:27.567
Come on.

36
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.266
After you.

37
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.734
Thank you.

[♪♪]

39
00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:37.667
Want to come over later

40
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.867
and watch a movie
with me and Matt?

41
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.266
I would.

42
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.367
but I have dinner plans
tonight.

43
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.700
Ooh. with who?

44
00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:44.967
My cousin. Terry.

45
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.700
I'm really sorry
to disappoint you.

46
00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:48.667
You'll find
your "Flannel Man" someday.

47
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.100
Who said I was looking?

48
00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:52.367
My life is just fine as is.
thank you very much.

49
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.500
Okay.

50
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.800
Bye.

[students] Happy New Year!

55
00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.734
Only a couple days left
of winter break. huh?

56
00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:19.033
Don't remind me.

57
00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.767
Well. I think I know
how to cheer you up.

58
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.333
I just got word

59
00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:24.400
that we are
the featured performance

60
00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.400
on the final weekend
of the Avon Winterfest!

61
00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:28.767
[cheering]

62
00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:31.734
Oh. where are Avery and Grace?

63
00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:39.166
Hi.

64
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.367
Are the girls here?

65
00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:42.400
Actually. that's what

66
00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:43.734
we came down here
to talk to you about...

67
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.500
You guys. start warming up.

68
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.800
[♪♪]

69
00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:57.500
Let's go. guys!

70
00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:58.500
Move it up. move it up!

71
00:02:58.633 --> 00:02:59.734
Let's go! Move it up!

72
00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.667
That's it. that's it.
Good. Good!

73
00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:07.633
[winces]

74
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.066
Still feeling some pain
in that ankle. huh. Ryan?

75
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.066
"Ryan" instead of "Coop"?

76
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.200
It's like
the hockey coach equivalent

77
00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:17.900
of a parent calling
their kids by their full name

78
00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:18.900
when they're in trouble.

79
00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:20.567
I think maybe
you are having some trouble.

80
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.567
Yeah. okay. fine.

81
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.567
the ankle is still
a little inflamed.

82
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.467
but I haven't played

83
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.467
since the beginning
of the season.

84
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.467
If you don't get me back.

85
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.467
we're not going to have a shot

86
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.467
at the next round
of the playoffs.

87
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.500
We do need you.

88
00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:31.734
but I can't let you play
if you're not 100%.

89
00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:33.000
If you have pain
and a high-ankle sprain.

90
00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.233
it means the ligaments
aren't strong enough.

91
00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:36.100
It's showing.

92
00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:37.133
Your transitions are slower

93
00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:38.300
and your lateral movements
are less sharp.

94
00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:40.266
I've done every single
therapeutic protocol

95
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.100
the team has asked me to do.
and then some.

96
00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:43.433
I know you did.

97
00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:44.500
but you're not
where you need to be.

98
00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:45.567
Not yet.

99
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.600
I'm meeting with your agent
tomorrow morning.

100
00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:48.300
We'll have to decide
where to go from here.

101
00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:55.066
So what's going on?

102
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.433
Is something wrong?
Are the girls okay?

103
00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:57.734
They're fine.

104
00:03:57.867 --> 00:03:58.934
It's just. over the holidays.

105
00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:00.667
they tried out
for the Dance Company Team.

106
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.967
and they made it.

107
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.033
That's great.

108
00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:05.133
Of course.
it's completely different

109
00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:06.166
than what we do here...

110
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.200
We know.

111
00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:09.066
and we thought
that they could do both.

112
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.500
it's just the dance team
is such a huge time commitment.

113
00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:12.500
It's four days a week.

114
00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:14.834
plus competitions on
weekends...

115
00:04:14.967 --> 00:04:16.300
We had to make a choice.

116
00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:19.300
Are you pulling the girls
out of ballet completely?

117
00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:23.834
We're so sorry
to spring it on you like this.

118
00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:25.867
Would you ever consider
starting a dance team here?

119
00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:28.867
That's just not what I do.

120
00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:31.700
I opened this studio
to teach ballet

121
00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:33.700
and a love of dance.

122
00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:35.800
When it becomes a competition.
it just changes everything.

123
00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:38.200
You know. in the end.

124
00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:39.633
I hope the girls
can still look at dance

125
00:04:39.767 --> 00:04:40.834
as something they love to do.

126
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.900
Thank you for letting me know.

127
00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:44.967
Of course.

128
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.934
Take care now.

129
00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:51.633
[♪♪]

130
00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:56.100
[Terry] Mm! You're my favorite
cousin. Jenna.

131
00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:58.433
Nobody does comfort food
like you do.

132
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.867
Are you sure you don't want
to stay the night?

133
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.600
The guest house is yours
if you want it.

134
00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:06.600
Thanks. but I've got to head
back to the city after this.

135
00:05:06.734 --> 00:05:07.767
I only came up to do

136
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.433
a little scouting in Hartford
with the Wolf Pack.

137
00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:11.200
That's a hockey team. right?

138
00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:12.834
You're killing me.

139
00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:14.066
Yes.

140
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.567
They are the minor league team
for the New York Rangers--

141
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.934
which is also a hockey team.

142
00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:18.967
Yeah.

143
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.066
How's work going for you. huh?

144
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.266
How's the studio?

145
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.367
Honestly. not great.

146
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.433
I just lost a couple dancers

147
00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:26.100
to one of
those competitive dance teams.

148
00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:27.567
And they decided
to raise rent on me

149
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.400
at the end of the month.

150
00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:30.867
It's just bad timing.

151
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.900
Mm.

152
00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:33.200
I just wish
everything could stay the same.

153
00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.533
[text alert chimes]

154
00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.166
-One second.
-Yeah.

155
00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:39.233
Is everything okay on your end?

156
00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:40.433
Yeah. I have this client.

157
00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:42.233
who's rehabbing
from a high-ankle sprain.

158
00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:43.867
and...

159
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.033
it's just not going well.

160
00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:47.133
That's a tough injury
to come back from.

161
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.100
But you did.

162
00:05:49.233 --> 00:05:50.667
You got back on stage.

163
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.033
What did you do to rehab it?

164
00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:55.633
I went back to
the basic ballet fundamentals

165
00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:57.066
and I had to rebuild
from the ground up.

166
00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:58.967
I actually have

167
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.133
a couple of dancer friends
in New York

168
00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:01.633
who train
professional football players

169
00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:04.000
with the same technique
that I used.

170
00:06:04.133 --> 00:06:05.133
It makes a huge difference

171
00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:07.767
with strength.
balance. agility...

172
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.867
It works.

173
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.200
Interesting.

174
00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:12.567
Good to know.

175
00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:17.333
[crowd murmuring]

176
00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:20.967
[fan] Coop!

177
00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:23.667
Coop!

178
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.800
Hey. Coop.

179
00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:26.033
Are you back with the team now?

180
00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:27.767
Not quite yet. but soon.

181
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.967
Because my dad bought me
your jersey for Christmas.

182
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.033
and said I could exchange it

183
00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:32.133
for someone else's
if you retire.

184
00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:33.300
Well. I promise.

185
00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:35.600
you won't have to
exchange anything.

186
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.700
Thank you.

187
00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:38.900
Nice to meet you.

188
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.834
[groans]

189
00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:45.934
[♪♪]

190
00:06:46.066 --> 00:06:47.367
[Terry] We're running
out of options here. Coop.

191
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.000
I need you to be doing
whatever it takes

192
00:06:49.133 --> 00:06:49.867
to get you back

193
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.266
where you were
before the injury.

194
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.467
Terry. I have done
everything there is to do.

195
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.367
Not everything.

196
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.567
What else is there?

197
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.333
I have done infrared therapy.

198
00:06:59.467 --> 00:07:00.633
I have done acupuncture.

199
00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:01.700
stem-cell injections...

200
00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:02.900
What I have in mind--

201
00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:04.967
and what I talked
to Coach Jackson about--

202
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.467
is nothing like that.

203
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.433
Then what is it like?

204
00:07:07.567 --> 00:07:08.433
Well. it's like...

205
00:07:08.567 --> 00:07:10.066
ballet.

206
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.867
In that it is ballet.

207
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.533
[laughs]

208
00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:15.667
Yeah. right. okay.

209
00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:17.600
And for the record.

210
00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:20.400
tutu is not a good look for me.

211
00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:21.767
All right. listen.
hear me out. Coop.

212
00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:24.200
All right. I was talking
to my cousin. Jenna

213
00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:26.000
about this just yesterday.
all right?

214
00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:27.834
She had the same injury
as you do.

215
00:07:27.967 --> 00:07:29.400
when she was a professional
ballet dancer.

216
00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:32.166
She used
basic ballet fundamentals

217
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.233
to rehab her own injury--

218
00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:35.734
got her back to 100%.

219
00:07:35.867 --> 00:07:36.900
Is this the part
where you tell me

220
00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:38.100
to become
somebody's ice-dancing partner

221
00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:40.100
and we try out for the Olympics?

222
00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:41.200
This is serious. Ryan.

223
00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:42.500
A lot of pro athletes

224
00:07:42.633 --> 00:07:45.166
are having success
with the same technique.

225
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.333
Jenna can get you there. too.

226
00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:47.467
And the Rangers--

227
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.333
they're fully on board
with the idea.

228
00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:55.300
Listen. as your agent
and as your friend.

229
00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:56.667
I'm going to be blunt.

230
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.600
If you don't do
something right now...

231
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.800
...the closest you'll get
to playing in the NHL again

232
00:08:01.934 --> 00:08:02.800
is...

233
00:08:02.934 --> 00:08:04.266
Don't say that out loud.

234
00:08:05.367 --> 00:08:06.567
I can't even think about
what I would do

235
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.000
if I wasn't able
to play anymore.

236
00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:09.533
You don't have to
think about that

237
00:08:09.667 --> 00:08:12.033
for a long. long time.

238
00:08:13.033 --> 00:08:14.233
Unless you give up.

239
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.500
I'll see myself out.

240
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.300
[♪♪]

241
00:08:22.433 --> 00:08:24.967
Terry. I said ballet therapy
is a great idea--

242
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.100
but I teach
ballet to kids.

243
00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:27.200
not hockey players.

244
00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:28.900
Can't he find someone
in New York to do it?

245
00:08:29.033 --> 00:08:29.800
No. no.

246
00:08:29.934 --> 00:08:30.834
He's actually going
to be starting

247
00:08:30.967 --> 00:08:31.834
back with the Wolf Pack.

248
00:08:31.967 --> 00:08:33.367
You know. weight training.

249
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.066
eventually some ice time...

250
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.900
and then hopefully
back with the Rangers

251
00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:37.900
before the playoffs.

252
00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:39.400
And I live near the rink.

253
00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:40.900
so I'm guessing this is
a convenience thing.

254
00:08:41.033 --> 00:08:41.900
Look.

255
00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:44.500
I would hire you
no matter where you lived.

256
00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:46.433
I All right?
You're the only one I trust.

257
00:08:46.567 --> 00:08:49.400
You know exactly what to do.

258
00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:50.600
And. more importantly.

259
00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:52.300
you understand
more than anyone else

260
00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:53.900
what he's going through
right now.

261
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.266
And they're willing to pay
plenty of money

262
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.467
for you to sign on.

263
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.400
Terry. it's not about
the money.

264
00:08:59.533 --> 00:09:01.467
It's just not what I do.

265
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.367
But thank you
for thinking of me.

266
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.367
Let's talk soon. okay?

267
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.200
All right.
Think about it?

268
00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:06.400
Okay. I'll think about it.

269
00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:07.800
Bye.

270
00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:14.734
[♪♪]

271
00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:31.967
Thomas!

272
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.333
How are you. Jenna?

273
00:09:33.467 --> 00:09:34.266
Hi. I'm good.

274
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.300
You know. I'm glad I caught you.

275
00:09:35.433 --> 00:09:37.300
I wanted to talk about
that rent increase

276
00:09:37.433 --> 00:09:39.300
and possibly pushing it
a month or two?

277
00:09:39.433 --> 00:09:40.600
Is the business okay?

278
00:09:41.767 --> 00:09:42.834
It's fine.

279
00:09:42.967 --> 00:09:44.700
I'm just having some turnover
with the older students.

280
00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:46.066
I wish I could help.

281
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.500
but the increase
is for the entire building.

282
00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:51.300
I can't really make exceptions
for one tenant over another.

283
00:09:51.433 --> 00:09:52.667
Of course.

284
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.700
I just thought I would ask.

285
00:09:53.834 --> 00:09:56.467
I really am sorry. but...

286
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.700
I'm sure the Avon Winterfest

287
00:09:57.834 --> 00:09:59.667
will be great publicity
for your studio.

288
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.767
I hope you can make it.

289
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.467
If there's anything I can do.
let me know.

290
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.800
You can not raise the rent...

291
00:10:04.934 --> 00:10:05.800
[chuckling]

292
00:10:05.934 --> 00:10:07.433
Except that.

293
00:10:07.567 --> 00:10:08.467
I'm so sorry.

294
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.834
Catch you next time.

295
00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:20.567
[line ringing]

296
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.500
Exactly how much money
is "plenty"?

297
00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:28.000
Car service is here.

298
00:10:28.133 --> 00:10:29.934
Jenna said she'll be
expecting you

299
00:10:30.066 --> 00:10:31.633
at the guest house
in the next couple hours.

300
00:10:31.767 --> 00:10:34.000
You're sure this "guest house"
is as good as a hotel?

301
00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.166
Trust me.
It's better.

302
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.400
Then why isn't it
already booked up

303
00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:38.500
like the hotel is?

304
00:10:38.633 --> 00:10:40.900
Well. she normally
rents it out in the fall

305
00:10:41.033 --> 00:10:42.166
for all the leaf peepers.

306
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.934
but she's doing me
a "family favor".

307
00:10:44.066 --> 00:10:45.467
You're sure
you're not just hiring her

308
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.367
because she's family?

309
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.700
She really knows
what she's doing?

310
00:10:47.834 --> 00:10:49.000
Coop.

311
00:10:49.133 --> 00:10:50.867
I wouldn't trust your future

312
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.800
to anyone I didn't have
complete confidence in.

313
00:10:53.767 --> 00:10:54.700
And if it doesn't work?

314
00:10:54.834 --> 00:10:55.700
It will.

315
00:10:55.834 --> 00:10:56.667
I'm sure of it.

316
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.000
Time for you
to go show everybody

317
00:10:58.133 --> 00:10:59.367
how strong you really are.

318
00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:05.600
[♪♪]

319
00:11:08.066 --> 00:11:09.467
All right.

320
00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:16.900
-Hi.
-I got your message. Jenna.

321
00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:18.166
This is amazing!

322
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.233
Coop's one of
my favorite players!

323
00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:20.333
I thought his name was Ryan.

324
00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:22.266
It's Ryan Cooper.

325
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.700
Ryan "Coop" Cooper.

326
00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:25.400
Okay. you saying it like that

327
00:11:25.533 --> 00:11:26.967
isn't going to make me
know who he is.

328
00:11:28.033 --> 00:11:29.400
You didn't even
look him up online?

329
00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:30.900
No. I just know
he's one of Terry's clients.

330
00:11:35.667 --> 00:11:36.633
[Jenna] Oh.

331
00:11:37.867 --> 00:11:39.266
Well. clearly. he has veneers.

332
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.567
And since when
do you watch hockey?

333
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.734
I do when Matt's out of town.

334
00:11:42.867 --> 00:11:44.867
He's really
just not a hockey person.

335
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.133
Welcome to my world.

336
00:11:46.266 --> 00:11:47.700
Still. you should study up
on the game before he gets here.

337
00:11:47.834 --> 00:11:48.867
I don't need to.

338
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.266
What I do works for any sport.

339
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.533
I am helping him build
the foundation he needs

340
00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:55.567
to support the entire structure
of the foot and ankle.

341
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:58.433
Still. you should probably
know something about hockey.

342
00:11:58.567 --> 00:12:02.000
Okay. ice skates. sticks.
pucks. and fighting.

343
00:12:02.133 --> 00:12:03.033
I give up.

344
00:12:04.567 --> 00:12:05.700
[Jenna] Oh. no!
I just fixed that.

Wow.

348
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.233
Terry was right.

do you normally
come in without knocking?

00:14:24.567 --> 00:14:27.000
To my own house? Yes.

368
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.767
Wait. did you think this was
the place you were renting?

369
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.767
This isn't the rental house?

370
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.166
No. This is my house.

371
00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.700
Let me show you
where the Guest House is.

372
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.734
[♪♪]

373
00:14:56.033 --> 00:14:57.400
I'm sleeping in the garage?

374
00:14:58.467 --> 00:14:59.900
No. that is a fully-furnished.

375
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.266
impeccably-decorated suite
above the garage.

376
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.600
Okay. Hang on.

377
00:15:03.734 --> 00:15:05.333
You told me to look for the key
underneath the flower pot.

378
00:15:05.467 --> 00:15:06.667
which it wasn't. by the way.

379
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.934
It was underneath the mat.

380
00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:13.500
Because that's where you keep
the spare key to your house.

381
00:15:13.633 --> 00:15:14.667
[Jenna] Mm-hmm.

382
00:15:16.834 --> 00:15:17.800
Bet that happens all the time.

383
00:15:17.934 --> 00:15:19.166
You're the first.

384
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.000
It's a really nice house.
by the way.

385
00:15:23.133 --> 00:15:24.166
-Any chance I--
-Oh. definitely not.

386
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.200
No.

387
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.266
You're used to getting
everything you want. aren't you?

388
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.133
Can I be honest
with you. Jenna?

389
00:15:32.934 --> 00:15:34.633
Right now I'm not getting
anything I want.

390
00:15:39.867 --> 00:15:40.800
Yeah.

391
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.033
[♪♪]

392
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.633
You're acting like
I brought you

393
00:15:54.767 --> 00:15:55.867
into an abandoned shack.

394
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.500
This place is great.

395
00:15:57.633 --> 00:15:59.367
Yeah. but yours is better.

396
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.100
Unbelievable.

397
00:16:03.633 --> 00:16:04.367
All right.

398
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.333
this binder right here

399
00:16:05.467 --> 00:16:06.367
will tell you

400
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.233
everything you need to know
about the area.

401
00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:09.100
Shopping. food...

402
00:16:09.233 --> 00:16:10.400
Oh. food.
Most important.

403
00:16:10.533 --> 00:16:12.867
[Jenna] The big thing right now
is the "Avon Winterfest."

404
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.934
They have different events
every weekend in January.

405
00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:16.867
so you have the art walk.

406
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.900
food fair--

407
00:16:18.033 --> 00:16:19.567
oh. then on the final weekend.

408
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.834
they have performances
from bands. theaters.

409
00:16:21.967 --> 00:16:23.200
and local dance studios--

410
00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:24.300
mine included.

411
00:16:24.433 --> 00:16:26.567
Oh. you're not going
to make me perform. are you?

412
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.834
Oh. no.

413
00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:29.433
That's just
for my regular students.

414
00:16:29.567 --> 00:16:30.734
Oh.

415
00:16:30.867 --> 00:16:32.333
So...

416
00:16:32.467 --> 00:16:33.767
where's the TV?

417
00:16:35.166 --> 00:16:37.133
Oh. um. it's broken.

418
00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:40.900
Sorry. I'm just not used to
having renters here so soon.

419
00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:42.100
They usually come in the fall.

420
00:16:42.233 --> 00:16:43.066
That's right.

421
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.033
Terry told me
you rent to leaf-peepers.

422
00:16:46.567 --> 00:16:48.433
You know. I prefer
"foliage enthusiasts."

423
00:16:49.567 --> 00:16:50.500
So. Terry was saying

424
00:16:50.633 --> 00:16:52.200
that you have
weight training at 10:30 a.m.

425
00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:53.667
with the Rangers'
minor league team in Hartford?

426
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.166
Wolf Pack. Yeah.

427
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.900
So you can meet me
at the studio at 11:30 a.m.

428
00:16:57.033 --> 00:16:58.567
right from the rink.

429
00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.567
We'll have our private lesson.

430
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:00.934
Can we say twelve?

431
00:17:01.066 --> 00:17:02.033
Man's gotta eat.

432
00:17:03.734 --> 00:17:04.500
Yeah. okay.

433
00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:05.500
Noon is fine.

434
00:17:05.633 --> 00:17:06.834
Just make sure
you eat something healthy.

435
00:17:06.967 --> 00:17:08.233
I don't want you coming in
weighed down.

436
00:17:08.367 --> 00:17:10.500
Healthy eating
is a top priority.

437
00:17:12.133 --> 00:17:13.100
Clearly.

438
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.967
Also. please try not to be late.

439
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.033
My first afternoon class
is at one.

440
00:17:20.233 --> 00:17:21.867
So. guess
I'm really doing this.

441
00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:26.333
You know.
I'm going to teach you

442
00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:28.700
how to work through basically
the same exact injury I had.

443
00:17:30.367 --> 00:17:31.900
I know what I'm doing
and you're going to be fine.

444
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.767
I hope you're right.

445
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.767
'cause if you're not.

446
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.433
I'm not sure
what I'm going to do.

447
00:17:38.867 --> 00:17:40.433
[Erin] Knock. knock!

448
00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:41.433
Hi!

449
00:17:41.567 --> 00:17:44.333
Ryan. this is
my neighbor. Erin.

450
00:17:44.467 --> 00:17:45.400
Hi. Ryan!

451
00:17:45.533 --> 00:17:47.433
I just popped over
to say welcome to Avon.

452
00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:48.567
Thank you!

453
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.433
Seriously?

454
00:17:49.567 --> 00:17:50.633
I like to make
a good impression.

455
00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:52.333
Well. Erin.
it is a pleasure to meet you.

456
00:17:52.467 --> 00:17:53.500
And you can call me "Coop."

457
00:17:53.633 --> 00:17:55.300
Okay...

458
00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:56.300
Coop.

459
00:17:56.433 --> 00:17:57.300
[Jenna] Okay.

460
00:17:57.433 --> 00:17:58.433
we're going to just
let you get settled.

461
00:17:58.567 --> 00:17:59.900
If you need anything.
let me know.

462
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.734
Otherwise. I will see you
at the studio tomorrow.

463
00:18:01.867 --> 00:18:02.867
At class.

464
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.867
-Come on.
-I'll be there.

465
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.834
Twelve noon on the dot.

466
00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:06.166
Bye. "Coop"!

467
00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:09.633
[Jenna] Let's go.

468
00:18:12.266 --> 00:18:13.633
[Ryan] Bye.

469
00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.500
[♪♪]

470
00:18:26.633 --> 00:18:27.734
Unbelievable.

471
00:18:31.166 --> 00:18:31.934
Hey. class.

472
00:18:32.066 --> 00:18:33.166
Come on in. let's get started.

473
00:18:36.266 --> 00:18:37.233
You guys ready?

474
00:18:40.767 --> 00:18:43.667
[♪♪]

475
00:18:49.867 --> 00:18:51.800
I am so sorry I'm late.

476
00:18:51.934 --> 00:18:52.667
No problem.

477
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:53.867
It's just there was

478
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.800
a bunch of kids waiting for me
outside the XL Center.

479
00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:57.467
and I didn't want
to disappoint them.

480
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.867
That's very nice of you.

481
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.500
So you like kids. then?

482
00:19:00.633 --> 00:19:01.533
Sure.

483
00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:02.700
That's good to know!

484
00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:05.367
Let's get started.

485
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.934
-Wait. Here? With them?
-Mm-hmm.

486
00:19:08.066 --> 00:19:10.367
I thought this was going to be.
like. a private class.

487
00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.233
Oh. it was. At noon.

488
00:19:12.367 --> 00:19:14.300
You can put these on.

489
00:19:14.433 --> 00:19:15.600
Hey. class. listen up.

490
00:19:15.734 --> 00:19:17.233
this is Mr. Cooper.

491
00:19:17.367 --> 00:19:18.800
and he's going to be
dancing with us today.

492
00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:20.934
But this is
his first ballet lesson.

493
00:19:21.066 --> 00:19:23.100
so he's going to need
a lot of encouragement. okay?

494
00:19:23.233 --> 00:19:24.900
[cheering]

495
00:19:25.033 --> 00:19:26.300
Can we encourage him?

496
00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:27.867
[cheering]

497
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.433
Okay. I get it.

498
00:19:31.567 --> 00:19:34.100
You're trying to embarrass me
because I'm late.

499
00:19:34.233 --> 00:19:37.033
No. I am trying to give you
the lesson the Rangers paid for.

500
00:19:38.066 --> 00:19:40.333
This is literally
what we'd be doing anyway.

501
00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:42.633
Do you think you can keep up?

502
00:19:42.767 --> 00:19:43.867
Let's go.

503
00:19:46.934 --> 00:19:48.800
First...

504
00:19:48.934 --> 00:19:49.734
all the way up.

505
00:19:49.867 --> 00:19:50.734
and...

506
00:19:50.867 --> 00:19:53.400
turn. turn. turn. turn. turn.

507
00:19:53.533 --> 00:19:55.266
Yes!

508
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.367
[♪♪]

509
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.467
Oh. good job!

510
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.567
One more time.

511
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.567
Open that up.

512
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.200
Try to feel that stretch.

513
00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:04.300
All the way up.

514
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.266
Skip. Point your toes.

515
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.734
Okay. That's it for today.

516
00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:16.900
And back up. Back up.

517
00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:20.300
[exhales]

518
00:20:20.433 --> 00:20:22.734
All right. what did you think
of your first class?

519
00:20:22.867 --> 00:20:24.433
That was a piece of cake.

520
00:20:24.567 --> 00:20:25.667
[Jenna] Mm-hmm.

521
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.533
[rooster crowing]

522
00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.834
[wincing in pain]

523
00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:37.700
[♪♪]

524
00:20:41.767 --> 00:20:42.967
[groaning]

525
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.734
[groaning]

526
00:20:59.934 --> 00:21:01.066
Good morning.

527
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.200
I'm about to make some coffee.
You want some?

528
00:21:02.333 --> 00:21:03.633
What did you do to me?

529
00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:06.333
Everything is sore.
I can barely move.

530
00:21:06.467 --> 00:21:07.767
How is that even possible?

531
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.433
I was in class
with five-year-olds!

532
00:21:10.567 --> 00:21:11.800
Everything that hurts

533
00:21:11.934 --> 00:21:12.767
are the smaller muscles

534
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.200
you've been ignoring
your entire life.

535
00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:16.133
If you're sore.
it means I'm doing my job.

536
00:21:17.433 --> 00:21:20.200
Well. I have to weight train
with the Wolf Pack.

537
00:21:20.333 --> 00:21:21.967
How am I supposed to do that
if I can't move?

538
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.166
Well. you're
a professional athlete.

539
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.600
You know how to stretch. right?

540
00:21:25.734 --> 00:21:26.934
You just have to loosen up
a little.

541
00:21:27.066 --> 00:21:27.934
You'll be fine.

542
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.800
Yeah.

543
00:21:30.934 --> 00:21:32.633
Everything will be fine.

544
00:21:32.767 --> 00:21:33.734
[winces]

545
00:21:40.433 --> 00:21:42.500
How much longer
is this going to take?

546
00:21:42.633 --> 00:21:44.066
This is the last pour.
don't worry.

547
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.266
You're messing with me. right?

548
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.133
How do you make coffee?

549
00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:49.066
I don't know.

550
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.734
you stick the cup in the thing.

551
00:21:50.867 --> 00:21:52.600
press the button. bam.
you got coffee.

552
00:21:52.734 --> 00:21:53.734
Move on with your day.

553
00:21:53.867 --> 00:21:55.166
Here we go.

554
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.734
Thank you.

555
00:22:00.867 --> 00:22:01.967
You're welcome.

556
00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:06.734
It's better. right?

557
00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:08.767
It's snobbier.
I'll give you that.

558
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.934
[laughs]

559
00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:11.700
I am as far from snob
as it gets.

560
00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:14.934
What's that?

561
00:22:15.066 --> 00:22:17.266
Oh. this...

562
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.667
is a bacon and cheese quiche.

563
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.867
Fancy.

564
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.867
If you want.

565
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.934
you can just call it
an egg pie. okay?

566
00:22:25.066 --> 00:22:25.934
Happy now?

567
00:22:26.066 --> 00:22:27.000
Completely.

568
00:22:29.433 --> 00:22:30.300
Hi-gee?

569
00:22:30.433 --> 00:22:32.233
Oh. it's pronounced "Hue-guh."

570
00:22:32.367 --> 00:22:33.900
I can see why you changed
your last name to "Wagner."

571
00:22:34.033 --> 00:22:35.433
No!

572
00:22:35.567 --> 00:22:36.467
It's a Danish word.

573
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.166
Really. it's more of
a way of life.

574
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.367
It was
my grandparents' philosophy

575
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.867
when they moved here
from Denmark.

576
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.467
and that's what
they named the farm after.

577
00:22:45.367 --> 00:22:48.033
It's all about cultivating
feelings of happiness

578
00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:50.967
and warmth and family.

579
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.867
A feeling of being safe at home.

580
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.700
and being cozy.

581
00:22:54.834 --> 00:22:56.734
So. like.
an existential blanket?

582
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.033
Okay. have you ever
sat in front of a warm fire.

583
00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:02.967
drinking a hot cup of cocoa.

584
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.367
and you are surrounded
by your friends and family.

585
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.834
and all you are thinking is.

586
00:23:06.967 --> 00:23:08.767
"This is what life
is all about"?

587
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.700
That depends.

588
00:23:09.834 --> 00:23:10.900
Is there a hockey game on?

589
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.100
You know.

590
00:23:14.233 --> 00:23:16.300
your life can't be
about your career 24/7.

591
00:23:16.433 --> 00:23:18.033
Actually. yes. I can.

592
00:23:18.166 --> 00:23:19.433
I have since I could walk.

593
00:23:20.934 --> 00:23:23.033
Well. maybe you could use
a little more balance.

594
00:23:23.166 --> 00:23:23.967
Balance?

595
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.166
Isn't that what ballet is for?

596
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.900
That's not what I meant.

597
00:23:27.033 --> 00:23:28.967
Look. no offense.

598
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:29.967
but I didn't come

599
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.033
for warm blankets
and fireside chats.

600
00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:34.100
I came here to get my life back.

601
00:23:35.433 --> 00:23:36.900
Yeah. I totally get it.

602
00:23:38.934 --> 00:23:41.433
Isn't your ride for the rink
about to get here?

603
00:23:42.567 --> 00:23:43.467
Oh. yeah.

604
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.800
I need to go.

605
00:23:44.934 --> 00:23:46.000
You know. I can actually

606
00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:48.367
put your coffee
in a to-go mug if you want.

607
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.533
Wait. I thought

608
00:23:49.667 --> 00:23:51.767
you needed to make that mug
on a pottery wheel first.

609
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.266
Wow. Very funny.

610
00:23:55.667 --> 00:23:56.967
Okay...

611
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.533
All right.
I will see you at noon.

612
00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:03.533
Yes.
-That means twelve o'clock p.m.

613
00:24:03.667 --> 00:24:05.500
Yes. yes. thank you.

614
00:24:05.633 --> 00:24:09.533
Oh. and make sure
you stretch before practice.

615
00:24:09.667 --> 00:24:10.500
Yeah. Will do.

616
00:24:13.633 --> 00:24:17.000
[♪♪]

617
00:24:23.066 --> 00:24:24.000
You're late again.

618
00:24:24.133 --> 00:24:25.367
I got stuck behind
a school bus. so...

619
00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.500
you know.

620
00:24:26.633 --> 00:24:27.767
safety first!

621
00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:29.834
Let's just get started.

622
00:24:29.967 --> 00:24:31.100
All right.

623
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.667
[Jenna] All right. good job.
You can bring it down now.

624
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.266
Perfect.

625
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.367
So...

626
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.900
how was weight training?

627
00:24:43.033 --> 00:24:44.533
Were you able to work through
some of the soreness?

628
00:24:44.667 --> 00:24:46.000
Almost--

629
00:24:46.133 --> 00:24:48.066
except the team's ice bath
and Jacuzzi

630
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.200
are both broken.

631
00:24:49.333 --> 00:24:50.567
Busted pipes
in the training room.

632
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.767
Luckily for you.
I have an ice bath at home.

633
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.200
Really?

634
00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:56.734
Yes.

635
00:24:56.867 --> 00:24:58.367
In the form
of a nearly-frozen pond.

636
00:24:59.667 --> 00:25:01.166
A little polar bear plunge?

637
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.433
Sounds good to me.

638
00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:03.934
You wouldn't
really go in there. would you?

639
00:25:04.066 --> 00:25:05.633
Yeah. it's the exact same thing
as an ice bath--

640
00:25:05.767 --> 00:25:06.834
plus fish.

641
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.066
Okay...

642
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.667
we are going to review
your pliés.

643
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.166
so let's get into first.

644
00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:14.767
Can you turn out a little more?

645
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.734
Just a little bit more.
There we go.

646
00:25:17.633 --> 00:25:18.834
And plié.

647
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.233
Good job.
You remembered.

648
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.834
All right. one more.
Demi-plié.

649
00:25:28.367 --> 00:25:29.367
Great.

650
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.700
All right. we're going
to add another element.

651
00:25:30.834 --> 00:25:31.834
It's called a "glissade".

652
00:25:31.967 --> 00:25:32.834
Glissade.

653
00:25:32.967 --> 00:25:36.066
Just think toe-ball-heel.

654
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.800
but it has to sound
almost silent.

655
00:25:37.934 --> 00:25:38.967
So. it looks like this.

656
00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.900
Start in fifth...

657
00:25:41.033 --> 00:25:42.266
and...

658
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.266
glissade.

659
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.133
Softly.

660
00:25:45.266 --> 00:25:46.533
It should be almost silent.

661
00:25:48.066 --> 00:25:49.100
[thump]

662
00:25:50.734 --> 00:25:52.800
Why does it have to be silent?

663
00:25:52.934 --> 00:25:53.934
Because it shows

664
00:25:54.066 --> 00:25:55.100
that you have control

665
00:25:55.233 --> 00:25:57.500
over the smallest muscles
in your foot.

666
00:25:57.633 --> 00:25:58.967
creating a base of strength
for the ankle.

667
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.834
taking all the pressure
off of your ligament.

668
00:26:02.767 --> 00:26:03.667
Think of it
like building a house.

669
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.667
You wouldn't build a house

670
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.133
without
a solid foundation. right?

671
00:26:06.266 --> 00:26:06.967
This right here--

672
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.333
this is the concrete.

673
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.567
What?

674
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.066
It's cute.
you're using "guy stuff"

675
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.166
to try to get through to me.

676
00:26:14.533 --> 00:26:15.400
Well. is it working?

677
00:26:15.533 --> 00:26:17.533
Kind of.

678
00:26:17.667 --> 00:26:20.066
Except if you were
building a house.

679
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.567
what about the rebar?

680
00:26:23.533 --> 00:26:25.433
Quads. glutes and abs.

681
00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.934
And once the concrete is set.
everything else gets stronger.

682
00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:32.233
And yes. I know what rebar is

683
00:26:32.367 --> 00:26:33.767
because my dad
was in construction.

684
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.333
Try it again.
Fifth position.

685
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200
And...

686
00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:42.300
[Ryan groans]

687
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.567
How are five-year-olds
better at this than me?

688
00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.233
This is your second class.

689
00:26:47.367 --> 00:26:48.300
You've got to give
yourself a break.

690
00:26:48.433 --> 00:26:49.333
Yeah. well.
the only thing that matters

691
00:26:49.467 --> 00:26:51.100
is getting back to my team.

692
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.567
What if that doesn't happen?

693
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.166
I don't like having
to think about that.

694
00:27:00.734 --> 00:27:01.934
I think it's good
to believe in yourself.

695
00:27:02.066 --> 00:27:03.467
but I also think
you should have a back-up plan.

696
00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.767
No. Back-up plans

697
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.266
are for people
who expect to fail.

698
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.266
No.

699
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.900
back-up plans are for people

700
00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:12.467
who know that even if
they do everything right.

701
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.233
sometimes things change
that they can't control.

702
00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:19.500
[♪♪]

703
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.133
Is that what happened to you?

704
00:27:23.266 --> 00:27:25.834
An injury ended your career.
didn't it?

705
00:27:27.867 --> 00:27:29.734
I thought this technique
of yours worked.

706
00:27:29.867 --> 00:27:32.233
No. this technique does work.

707
00:27:32.367 --> 00:27:33.700
That's not why I stopped
dancing professionally.

708
00:27:33.834 --> 00:27:35.333
Then why?

709
00:27:37.367 --> 00:27:38.233
Ryan.

710
00:27:38.367 --> 00:27:39.467
this is your studio time. Ryan.

711
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.433
and we're already behind.

712
00:27:40.567 --> 00:27:41.700
so let's not waste it.

713
00:27:42.734 --> 00:27:44.967
We're going to combine
the moves that you just learned.

714
00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.133
Plié and glissade.

715
00:27:47.266 --> 00:27:48.567
Plié. glissade.

716
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.900
Watch me and then try it.

717
00:27:51.667 --> 00:27:52.367
Plié.

718
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.667
Glissade.

719
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.066
Ryan?

720
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.667
Come on.

721
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.734
Yeah.

722
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.400
Remember soft and light.

723
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.266
And...

724
00:28:11.934 --> 00:28:13.900
A little softer.
a little lighter.

725
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.633
So. where's Coop?

726
00:28:22.767 --> 00:28:24.233
Oh. I don't know.
in the guest house. I guess.

727
00:28:24.367 --> 00:28:25.233
Why?

728
00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:27.133
I wanted to introduce him
to Matt.

729
00:28:27.266 --> 00:28:28.800
You know. you didn't get
this excited

730
00:28:28.934 --> 00:28:30.133
when I said that
you could call me "Matt"

731
00:28:30.266 --> 00:28:31.400
instead of "Matthew".

732
00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:32.834
Do you really want me
to answer that?

733
00:28:32.967 --> 00:28:35.133
You should invite him
out with us tonight. Jenna.

734
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.867
I'm sure he has
better things to do.

735
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.900
Even if he didn't.

736
00:28:39.033 --> 00:28:40.667
I don't think
it's a good idea.

737
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.967
I have to keep
my professional life

738
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.033
separate from
my personal one.

739
00:28:44.166 --> 00:28:45.166
I made that mistake once.

740
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.667
and I'm not going
anywhere near that road again!

741
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.700
I finally have my life back.

742
00:28:48.834 --> 00:28:50.600
and I don't want
to change a thing.

743
00:28:50.734 --> 00:28:52.133
[car door closing]

744
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:54.266
Are you expecting someone?

745
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.800
No.

746
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.633
Hi. Can I help you?

747
00:29:02.767 --> 00:29:03.967
I'm here with the TV.

748
00:29:04.934 --> 00:29:05.767
I'm sorry. the what?

749
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.033
The TV.

750
00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:09.400
Oh. hey. man. no. I told you
the guest house in the back.

751
00:29:09.533 --> 00:29:10.800
Oh. I thought
that was the garage?

752
00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:17.400
[Jenna]
You bought a television?

753
00:29:17.533 --> 00:29:19.200
No. I rented a television.

754
00:29:19.333 --> 00:29:21.934
You couldn't even live
without one for a month?

755
00:29:22.066 --> 00:29:23.700
Of course I can.
I just didn't want to!

756
00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.600
Fine. Whatever.

757
00:29:25.734 --> 00:29:27.800
And here's my dinner.

758
00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:30.133
Thank you.

759
00:29:30.266 --> 00:29:31.767
What next with you?
A hot tub?

760
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.900
That's a great idea.

761
00:29:35.433 --> 00:29:36.300
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

762
00:29:37.333 --> 00:29:38.400
[Erin] Coop!

763
00:29:38.533 --> 00:29:39.300
What are you doing
out there in the cold?

764
00:29:39.433 --> 00:29:40.500
Come inside.

765
00:29:42.967 --> 00:29:44.133
Yeah. come on in.

766
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.233
You look great. by the way.

767
00:29:49.667 --> 00:29:51.133
Oh. thank you.

768
00:29:53.934 --> 00:29:55.133
Matt. this is Ryan Cooper.

769
00:29:55.266 --> 00:29:56.633
Coop. this is my husband. Matt.

770
00:29:56.767 --> 00:29:57.900
Hey. Matt.
Nice to meet you.

771
00:29:58.033 --> 00:29:59.800
Sorry for crashing your dinner.

772
00:29:59.934 --> 00:30:01.033
No worries.

773
00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:02.633
We were about
to head out now anyway.

774
00:30:02.767 --> 00:30:03.633
right. ladies?

775
00:30:03.767 --> 00:30:04.834
We should probably get going.

776
00:30:04.967 --> 00:30:06.834
It's "Ice Bar" night
at Avon Winterfest.

777
00:30:07.867 --> 00:30:08.700
It's basically a regular bar.

778
00:30:08.834 --> 00:30:09.700
outside. made of--

779
00:30:09.834 --> 00:30:10.633
Ice.

780
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:12.066
Yeah. I got that.

781
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.166
You're welcome to join us.

782
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.333
[Matt] That may not
be something he wants to do.

783
00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:18.467
[Jenna] Yeah. he probably
just wants to stay here

784
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.633
and eat himself
into a pizza-induced coma.

785
00:30:21.934 --> 00:30:22.800
Actually. I would love to come.

786
00:30:22.934 --> 00:30:23.867
Great.

787
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.700
I can eat pizza in the car.

788
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:32.066
So Matt. what do you do?

789
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.700
I'm a real-estate attorney.

790
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.967
Yeah. it's pretty boring.

791
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.400
Oh...

792
00:30:37.533 --> 00:30:38.400
Are you into hockey?

793
00:30:38.533 --> 00:30:40.834
No.

794
00:30:40.967 --> 00:30:43.400
No. I used to play
when I was a kid.

795
00:30:43.533 --> 00:30:45.000
but. yeah. I don't really
have time anymore.

796
00:30:46.734 --> 00:30:48.233
Come on.
let's go take a look around.

797
00:30:48.367 --> 00:30:49.333
Sure.

798
00:30:52.166 --> 00:30:53.033
So...

799
00:30:53.166 --> 00:30:54.033
hot drinks.

800
00:30:54.166 --> 00:30:57.233
warm clothes. fire tables...

801
00:30:57.367 --> 00:30:59.767
this is totally
your kind of scene. isn't it?

802
00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.467
Yeah. well. I am nothing
if not consistent.

803
00:31:02.633 --> 00:31:04.800
But it is missing one thing.

804
00:31:04.934 --> 00:31:06.000
What. the rest of your pizza?

805
00:31:06.133 --> 00:31:07.400
No. Hockey.

806
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.333
You know.
you can go one night

807
00:31:10.467 --> 00:31:11.767
without thinking about hockey.

808
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.867
Okay.

809
00:31:14.333 --> 00:31:15.633
Hey. what about air hockey?

810
00:31:17.066 --> 00:31:17.934
Are you even capable

811
00:31:18.066 --> 00:31:18.967
of doing anything

812
00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.400
that doesn't involve
a scoreboard?

813
00:31:20.533 --> 00:31:21.600
I prefer not to.

814
00:31:21.734 --> 00:31:23.667
Well. I probably
shouldn't play you in hockey--

815
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.266
air or otherwise.

816
00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.633
I'll go easy on you.

817
00:31:27.633 --> 00:31:28.867
Okay. Let's go.

818
00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:33.433
Ladies first.

819
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.967
[puck scores]

820
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:38.967
I wasn't ready.

821
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.600
Oh. that's fine.
We'll start over then.

822
00:31:44.967 --> 00:31:45.934
[puck scores]

823
00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.734
Are you hustling me?

824
00:31:48.867 --> 00:31:50.200
What? That's absurd.

825
00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:52.367
Okay. well.
I was taking it easy on you.

826
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.600
I didn't ask you to.

827
00:31:53.734 --> 00:31:55.133
Well. good. because
I'm not going to do it anymore.

828
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.533
[♪♪]

829
00:32:01.667 --> 00:32:02.600
There it is.

830
00:32:03.834 --> 00:32:04.967
Oh!

831
00:32:05.967 --> 00:32:07.000
Wait. you let me score
to make me feel better.

832
00:32:07.133 --> 00:32:08.000
Did it work?

833
00:32:08.133 --> 00:32:09.200
No!

834
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.266
Seriously.
how did you get this good?

835
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.367
I was on a national tour
for a ballet company.

836
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.033
and the crew had
an air hockey table.

837
00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:16.333
Let's just say
there was a lot of downtime.

838
00:32:17.266 --> 00:32:18.233
You know. you never did say

839
00:32:18.367 --> 00:32:20.500
why you went from being
a professional dancer

840
00:32:20.633 --> 00:32:21.600
to teaching.

841
00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:24.533
[Matt] Hey. word to the wise--

842
00:32:24.667 --> 00:32:25.900
don't play air hockey
against Jenna

843
00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:27.300
because she is a beast.

844
00:32:28.567 --> 00:32:30.166
Yeah. Thanks for the advice.

845
00:32:39.333 --> 00:32:40.400
Well. thanks again

846
00:32:40.533 --> 00:32:42.900
for the biggest defeat
of my entire athletic career.

847
00:32:43.033 --> 00:32:44.633
Oh. you are so welcome.

848
00:32:45.567 --> 00:32:46.900
But seriously...

849
00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:49.667
I had one of the best nights
I've had in a long time.

850
00:32:51.567 --> 00:32:52.667
Thanks for letting me tag along.

851
00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.266
I'm glad you came.

852
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.200
And now I have

853
00:32:55.333 --> 00:32:56.633
eternal air hockey
bragging rights.

854
00:33:00.133 --> 00:33:01.100
I'll see you at class tomorrow.

855
00:33:02.033 --> 00:33:02.934
I'll be there.

856
00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.734
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

857
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:14.266
[♪♪]

858
00:33:19.967 --> 00:33:23.967
[♪♪]

859
00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.300
Okay. second.
right here into plié fifth.

860
00:33:27.433 --> 00:33:28.967
and relevé up top.

861
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.400
It's a pirouette prep.

862
00:33:32.133 --> 00:33:33.166
How is it harder
to balance on my feet

863
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.500
than it is
on a thin metal blade on ice?

864
00:33:36.934 --> 00:33:38.567
Could you skate
the first time you tried?

865
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:39.734
No. it took a while.

866
00:33:39.867 --> 00:33:41.500
Yeah. it's the same thing
with dance.

867
00:33:41.633 --> 00:33:44.033
You're learning something new.
it's going to take time.

868
00:33:44.166 --> 00:33:45.333
It's always worth doing.

869
00:33:45.467 --> 00:33:48.033
How do you even know
if this works for hockey?

870
00:33:49.266 --> 00:33:50.967
Because before you got here.
I did my homework.

871
00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.800
I spoke with
your orthopedic team.

872
00:33:52.934 --> 00:33:53.767
and with dance teachers.

873
00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.734
who do this with athletes

874
00:33:54.867 --> 00:33:56.500
from all different
kinds of sports.

875
00:33:56.633 --> 00:33:57.467
Every single
one of their clients

876
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600
said they were more fluid.

877
00:33:58.734 --> 00:34:01.166
more dynamic.
lighter on their feet.

878
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.900
but most importantly.

879
00:34:03.033 --> 00:34:04.100
they were injury-free.

880
00:34:05.133 --> 00:34:06.200
Injury-free--

881
00:34:06.333 --> 00:34:07.700
I almost forgot
what that feels like.

882
00:34:07.834 --> 00:34:10.000
You're going to be there
soon enough.

883
00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:11.400
All right. let's go through
the sequence again.

884
00:34:11.533 --> 00:34:12.400
Start here.

885
00:34:12.533 --> 00:34:13.467
Don't worry about the hands.

886
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.667
Okay.

887
00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.066
And we're going
to slide into plié fifth.

888
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.633
and then relevé up.

889
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.734
[groans]

890
00:34:21.867 --> 00:34:23.166
I'm just glad
no one's here to see this.

891
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.300
I'm a viral video
waiting to happen.

892
00:34:26.433 --> 00:34:27.667
Well. I didn't tell anybody
you were here.

893
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.834
and I don't think
Erin did either.

894
00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:30.800
Besides. I don't think

895
00:34:30.934 --> 00:34:31.767
anybody's going
to know it's you.

896
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.100
[Felix] Oh. wow.

897
00:34:35.266 --> 00:34:36.734
You were saying?

898
00:34:36.867 --> 00:34:38.500
You're Ryan Cooper!

899
00:34:41.667 --> 00:34:42.734
That's me.

900
00:34:42.867 --> 00:34:43.667
What's your name?

901
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.333
I'm Felix.

902
00:34:45.467 --> 00:34:46.600
Felix. nice to meet you.

903
00:34:47.934 --> 00:34:51.033
Hey. don't tell anyone
you saw me here. okay?

904
00:34:51.166 --> 00:34:53.300
Why not?
What wrong with dance?

905
00:34:57.166 --> 00:34:58.166
Nothing. nothing.

906
00:34:59.033 --> 00:35:01.700
Nothing. I just...

907
00:35:01.834 --> 00:35:03.100
well. I'm trying
to stay under the radar.

908
00:35:03.233 --> 00:35:06.333
I don't want other players
to know my secret weapon.

909
00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:08.867
Felix lives
two houses down from me.

910
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.500
and he's one of
our best dancers.

911
00:35:10.633 --> 00:35:12.066
And he plays hockey.

912
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.100
More like sits on the bench.

913
00:35:14.233 --> 00:35:15.433
Hey. we all spend time
on the bench

914
00:35:15.567 --> 00:35:17.033
from time to time. bud.

915
00:35:17.166 --> 00:35:18.100
Just keep pushing yourself.

916
00:35:18.233 --> 00:35:19.100
It's only a matter of time.

917
00:35:19.233 --> 00:35:20.033
You'll get
to where you want to go.

918
00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:22.166
Yeah. You. too.

919
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.633
You saw me. huh?

920
00:35:24.767 --> 00:35:26.800
Sorry. I was just here
a little earlier.

921
00:35:26.934 --> 00:35:29.633
I didn't take videos
or anything.

922
00:35:29.767 --> 00:35:31.000
Thanks.

923
00:35:38.166 --> 00:35:39.033
Oh. you guys.

924
00:35:39.166 --> 00:35:41.734
a little over three weeks
until the show.

925
00:35:41.867 --> 00:35:42.734
I can count on all of you

926
00:35:42.867 --> 00:35:45.200
to come to every single
rehearsal. right?

927
00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:46.367
Make a full commitment?

928
00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.367
Yes?

929
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:48.400
[class] Yeah!

930
00:35:48.533 --> 00:35:49.600
Yes!

931
00:35:49.734 --> 00:35:50.834
All right. let's go!

932
00:35:50.967 --> 00:35:52.567
Uh. you guys
can take your marks.

933
00:35:54.767 --> 00:35:55.867
Ella? Hit it.

934
00:35:57.934 --> 00:36:02.266
[♪♪]

935
00:36:11.667 --> 00:36:16.300
[♪♪]

936
00:36:18.033 --> 00:36:19.300
They look great.

937
00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.200
[♪♪]

938
00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.967
[♪♪]

939
00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:49.633
[♪♪]

940
00:36:56.934 --> 00:36:59.033
Wow. That--that was awesome.

941
00:37:00.333 --> 00:37:02.367
Felix. wow.

942
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.934
You are an incredible athlete.

943
00:37:04.066 --> 00:37:05.166
I am?

944
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.033
Yeah. It takes real power
to be able to jump like that.

945
00:37:07.166 --> 00:37:07.967
I'm impressed.

946
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.867
Thank you! So much!

947
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.133
-Really good job.
-Thank you.

948
00:37:14.033 --> 00:37:15.467
Ooh. three minutes late.

949
00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:17.667
But we're getting closer.

950
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:19.834
Yes. it's progress.

951
00:37:20.867 --> 00:37:21.867
Go change your shoes.

952
00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.000
Shoes. right. Yes.

953
00:37:33.667 --> 00:37:35.166
Nice shot.

954
00:37:37.033 --> 00:37:38.166
It's supposed to get
really cold tonight.

955
00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.166
so I'm going to get you

956
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.300
an extra space heater
from the barn.

957
00:37:40.433 --> 00:37:42.100
I'll come with you.

958
00:37:42.233 --> 00:37:43.467
Thanks.

959
00:37:44.667 --> 00:37:47.200
So what do you mean
by "really cold"?

960
00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:48.533
Oh. zero?

961
00:37:48.667 --> 00:37:51.000
Okay. try subtracting
60 from that

962
00:37:51.133 --> 00:37:52.066
and then we're talking.

963
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.500
Where are you from.
the North Pole?

964
00:37:54.633 --> 00:37:55.533
Pretty close.

965
00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:57.433
Thunder Bay.

966
00:37:57.567 --> 00:37:59.066
Northern Canada.

967
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.567
It's where I grew up.
before we moved again.

968
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.133
It's where I learned
to love hockey.

969
00:38:04.266 --> 00:38:06.333
and decided that I would do...

970
00:38:06.467 --> 00:38:08.367
whatever it takes
to become pro.

971
00:38:10.467 --> 00:38:11.734
Well. that's why
you're here. right?

972
00:38:11.867 --> 00:38:13.767
To do whatever it takes
to get you back there again.

973
00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.600
-Hope so.
-This way.

974
00:38:19.533 --> 00:38:20.734
[Jenna] Thank you.

975
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.734
[Ryan] Wow.

976
00:38:24.867 --> 00:38:26.500
These all you?

977
00:38:26.633 --> 00:38:27.667
Oh. yeah.

978
00:38:29.734 --> 00:38:30.767
[Ryan] When was this?

979
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.667
Four years ago. Why?

980
00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.500
I think I was at
one of your shows!

981
00:38:35.633 --> 00:38:36.600
What?

982
00:38:36.734 --> 00:38:39.133
I remember
taking pictures that night.

983
00:38:39.266 --> 00:38:40.166
[Jenna] That's me!

984
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:41.066
[Ryan] That's me.

985
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.100
[Jenna] Wow.

986
00:38:42.233 --> 00:38:44.200
I don't remember
taking that photo.

987
00:38:44.333 --> 00:38:45.333
Really?

988
00:38:45.467 --> 00:38:47.600
I mean. we took
a lot of pictures with people.

989
00:38:47.734 --> 00:38:49.100
You were
the lead dancer. right?

990
00:38:49.233 --> 00:38:51.000
Mm-hmm.
The prima ballerina.

991
00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:52.567
You are incredible.

992
00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.333
I remember being
blown away by your performance.

993
00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:56.600
Thank you.

994
00:38:59.033 --> 00:39:00.834
Oh. who's that?

995
00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:03.233
That's my ex.

996
00:39:03.367 --> 00:39:05.233
We...

997
00:39:05.367 --> 00:39:07.734
started dating right around
the time that picture was taken.

998
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:09.667
Sorry.

999
00:39:11.266 --> 00:39:12.233
Don't be.

1000
00:39:12.367 --> 00:39:13.900
After I got hurt.

1001
00:39:14.033 --> 00:39:15.233
and the spotlight
I was always under

1002
00:39:15.367 --> 00:39:16.633
turned off...

1003
00:39:16.767 --> 00:39:17.934
so did her heart.

1004
00:39:18.934 --> 00:39:19.734
You know what.

1005
00:39:19.867 --> 00:39:21.166
she clearly
didn't deserve you.

1006
00:39:22.367 --> 00:39:23.367
You're gonna find somebody

1007
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.233
who loves you for more than
just playing hockey.

1008
00:39:25.367 --> 00:39:26.233
That's the thing.

1009
00:39:26.367 --> 00:39:28.100
I don't know
who I am without hockey.

1010
00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.400
Yeah.

1011
00:39:30.533 --> 00:39:31.467
I said that
when I left the ballet.

1012
00:39:32.567 --> 00:39:33.800
Okay. so what did happen?

1013
00:39:37.166 --> 00:39:38.133
Yeah. let's just say

1014
00:39:38.266 --> 00:39:40.200
that dating a co-worker
is never a good idea--

1015
00:39:40.333 --> 00:39:42.767
especially if that co-worker
is your boss.

1016
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.834
[Ryan] Enough said.

1017
00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:45.500
Good. because
I don't want to talk about it.

1018
00:39:45.633 --> 00:39:46.367
Let's get this
back to your place.

1019
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.500
Here. let me help you
with that.

1020
00:39:47.633 --> 00:39:49.500
Ooh. no.
Not with that bad ankle.

1021
00:39:49.633 --> 00:39:50.734
Let's go.

1022
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.967
Did you hurt your ankle?

1023
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.367
Yeah. just a little bit.

1024
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.667
Did you tweak it
in our class this morning?

1025
00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.233
No. not in class.
I...

1026
00:40:02.367 --> 00:40:05.400
I went back to the rink
afterwards.

1027
00:40:05.533 --> 00:40:07.166
[Jenna] And?

1028
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.867
And I got back on the ice.

1029
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.500
Wait. you what?

1030
00:40:10.633 --> 00:40:12.133
I wanted to see how it felt.

1031
00:40:12.266 --> 00:40:14.500
and it felt great.
didn't hurt at all.

1032
00:40:14.633 --> 00:40:15.967
So I pushed myself
a little bit.

1033
00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.100
and it still didn't hurt.

1034
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.734
So I skated drills
with the team.

1035
00:40:20.867 --> 00:40:22.000
What were you thinking?

1036
00:40:22.133 --> 00:40:23.867
You could've re-torn
the ligament!

1037
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:24.900
I had to get back out there.

1038
00:40:25.033 --> 00:40:26.033
It's hard to explain.

1039
00:40:26.166 --> 00:40:28.400
Ryan. no one understands
wanting their life back

1040
00:40:28.533 --> 00:40:30.300
more than I do.

1041
00:40:30.433 --> 00:40:31.633
But you have to trust
the process.

1042
00:40:31.767 --> 00:40:32.834
You have to trust me.

1043
00:40:32.967 --> 00:40:34.433
I do trust you.

1044
00:40:34.567 --> 00:40:36.767
Well. then quit messing
around.

1045
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.667
Take tomorrow off.

1046
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.066
and we'll start
fresh again on Thursday.

1047
00:40:41.133 --> 00:40:42.200
-Okay?
-Okay.

1048
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.667
Come on.

1049
00:40:45.867 --> 00:40:50.066
[♪♪]

1050
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.734
Good morning.
You are up early.

1051
00:40:54.867 --> 00:40:55.867
I need to talk to you.

1052
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.900
Oh. Yeah. okay.

1053
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.767
Is everything okay?

1054
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.200
Okay. So I was meeting
with a client yesterday.

1055
00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:03.200
Jackie Olsen.

1056
00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:04.233
Oh. I love Jackie!

1057
00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:05.700
Her daughter. Alyssa.
is a student of mine.

1058
00:41:05.834 --> 00:41:07.433
Well. I was going over
her expenses.

1059
00:41:07.567 --> 00:41:08.533
and she mentioned

1060
00:41:08.667 --> 00:41:09.934
she's looking for ways
to save money next year.

1061
00:41:10.066 --> 00:41:13.100
and she said Dance Company
had another tryout.

1062
00:41:13.233 --> 00:41:15.200
They're offering a big discount
to new dancers.

1063
00:41:15.333 --> 00:41:16.433
I think she's going to take it.

1064
00:41:16.567 --> 00:41:18.800
And I don't think
she's the only one.

1065
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.767
Well. if people care
about winning competitions.

1066
00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.967
then that's
where they should be.

1067
00:41:27.233 --> 00:41:28.367
What are you going to do?

1068
00:41:29.367 --> 00:41:30.900
My first instinct
is to go back to bed.

1069
00:41:31.033 --> 00:41:31.967
and when I wake up.

1070
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.266
maybe it'll be November

1071
00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.066
and everything will be
how it was before.

1072
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.166
Solid plan.

1073
00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.600
Do you want some coffee?

1074
00:41:38.734 --> 00:41:39.867
Yes.

1075
00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:46.233
[♪♪]

1076
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.567
Hi.

1077
00:41:50.533 --> 00:41:51.400
Hi.

1078
00:41:51.533 --> 00:41:53.400
Check it out.
Right on time. Boom!

1079
00:41:53.533 --> 00:41:55.600
Yeah. except you were supposed
to rest today.

1080
00:41:55.734 --> 00:41:56.567
Yeah. but my ankle feels fine.

1081
00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.033
I didn't want to waste
any more time.

1082
00:41:58.166 --> 00:41:59.967
No. you said
that you would trust me.

1083
00:42:00.166 --> 00:42:01.133
I don't want you doing anything

1084
00:42:01.266 --> 00:42:02.767
that would put stress
on your ligaments. okay?

1085
00:42:03.767 --> 00:42:04.734
Okay.

1086
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.800
Okay. I didn't know
me wanting to take my lesson

1087
00:42:07.934 --> 00:42:08.967
would upset you so much.

1088
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.467
It's not that.

1089
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.367
I just have a lot going on
with the studio. and...

1090
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.834
I just took that out on you.

1091
00:42:17.967 --> 00:42:19.100
I'm sorry.

1092
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.567
Do you want to take a walk?

1093
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.500
I don't have class
for another hour.

1094
00:42:25.633 --> 00:42:26.433
so...

1095
00:42:26.567 --> 00:42:27.567
yeah. sure.

1096
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.000
So any idea where a guy can get

1097
00:42:33.133 --> 00:42:35.000
a decent cup of hot cocoa
around here?

1098
00:42:35.133 --> 00:42:36.266
Oh. yeah.

1099
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.834
the town square has. like.
five different drink carts.

1100
00:42:37.967 --> 00:42:42.367
You need a hot cocoa.
cider. hot toddies--

1101
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.467
Ah!

1102
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.200
I knew even talking about
something "warm and cozy"

1103
00:42:45.333 --> 00:42:46.533
would put a smile
back on your face.

1104
00:42:48.934 --> 00:42:50.633
Thank you.

1105
00:42:51.867 --> 00:42:53.266
Thanks.

1106
00:42:54.767 --> 00:42:58.333
-Better?
-Mm. Much. Thank you.

1107
00:42:58.467 --> 00:43:01.166
So what's happening
with the dance studio?

1108
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.333
Oh. I just have to get
my enrollment numbers back up.

1109
00:43:04.467 --> 00:43:06.900
You know. I'm sure I can get
the Rangers to pay more.

1110
00:43:07.033 --> 00:43:07.834
Thank you.

1111
00:43:07.967 --> 00:43:09.400
but that's not
a long-term solution.

1112
00:43:10.533 --> 00:43:11.700
I get that
all these dance teams

1113
00:43:11.834 --> 00:43:14.200
are a trend right now. but...

1114
00:43:14.333 --> 00:43:15.166
I mean. ballet is not

1115
00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.934
supposed to be about
winning or losing.

1116
00:43:17.066 --> 00:43:18.400
It's a form of self-expression.

1117
00:43:19.867 --> 00:43:21.533
Sometimes. I think I'm doing
the same thing with hockey.

1118
00:43:21.667 --> 00:43:22.700
I love the game. but...

1119
00:43:24.133 --> 00:43:27.533
right now it just feels like
it's about winning.

1120
00:43:28.867 --> 00:43:30.467
When was the last time
you played just for fun?

1121
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.033
I can't even remember
the last time I played for fun.

1122
00:43:34.166 --> 00:43:35.967
Maybe we can do something
about that.

1123
00:43:37.567 --> 00:43:39.000
So what is going on
with the studio?

1124
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:41.600
Well. right now.

1125
00:43:41.734 --> 00:43:42.533
my plan is to just

1126
00:43:42.667 --> 00:43:44.567
get the word out
to the community

1127
00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:45.567
during Winterfest.

1128
00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.200
and tell them
all about Avon Ballet.

1129
00:43:49.533 --> 00:43:52.467
That's a wonderful idea.
but what if it doesn't work?

1130
00:43:53.567 --> 00:43:54.734
What's your back-up plan?

1131
00:43:54.867 --> 00:43:55.767
Whoa.

1132
00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.400
I thought you said
back-up plans

1133
00:43:57.533 --> 00:43:59.500
were for people
who expect to fail.

1134
00:43:59.633 --> 00:44:02.333
Okay. I don't
expect you to fail.

1135
00:44:02.467 --> 00:44:04.600
I...

1136
00:44:04.734 --> 00:44:05.934
I just care about
what happens to you.

1137
00:44:08.533 --> 00:44:09.500
Thank you.

1138
00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:11.734
We'll be fine.

1139
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.000
And for the record.

1140
00:44:14.133 --> 00:44:15.600
I care about
what happens to you. too.

1141
00:44:23.467 --> 00:44:28.500
[♪♪]

1142
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.734
This is looking
really good. you guys.

1143
00:44:35.867 --> 00:44:36.834
Awesome!

1144
00:44:38.033 --> 00:44:39.900
Felix. can we practice
your transition

1145
00:44:40.033 --> 00:44:40.934
in and out of the jump?

1146
00:44:41.066 --> 00:44:41.934
Yup.

1147
00:44:42.066 --> 00:44:43.100
[Jenna] Whenever you're ready.

1148
00:44:52.467 --> 00:44:53.400
That was perfect!

1149
00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.934
This is going to be
the best show we've ever done.

1150
00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.633
[applause]

1151
00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:07.433
[♪♪]

1152
00:45:32.433 --> 00:45:36.567
[♪♪]

1153
00:45:42.367 --> 00:45:44.200
Enjoying the rest
of your day off. I see.

1154
00:45:44.333 --> 00:45:46.300
Just trying to beat
my personal record

1155
00:45:46.433 --> 00:45:48.166
at puck juggling.

1156
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.266
So you're bored.

1157
00:45:50.834 --> 00:45:52.166
So bored.

1158
00:45:53.133 --> 00:45:54.233
You know. it's funny.

1159
00:45:54.367 --> 00:45:56.266
because you seem to hang around
my door around mealtimes.

1160
00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.233
Like a stray cat.

1161
00:45:57.367 --> 00:45:59.533
Must be the smell
of home cooking.

1162
00:45:59.667 --> 00:46:00.633
Haven't had that
in a long time.

1163
00:46:01.567 --> 00:46:02.633
Well. if you're bored.

1164
00:46:02.767 --> 00:46:03.934
you can come inside

1165
00:46:04.066 --> 00:46:06.233
and I can teach you how to make
a really easy healthy meal.

1166
00:46:06.367 --> 00:46:07.533
Is it healthy nachos?

1167
00:46:08.934 --> 00:46:09.800
Get inside. Mittens.

1168
00:46:09.934 --> 00:46:11.266
Let's get you
some culinary therapy.

1169
00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.200
You just don't seem like
the type of person

1170
00:46:18.333 --> 00:46:20.400
to quit their job over some guy.

1171
00:46:20.533 --> 00:46:21.900
He wasn't "some guy".

1172
00:46:22.033 --> 00:46:23.600
Daniel was
the creative director

1173
00:46:23.734 --> 00:46:24.967
of the National Ballet Theater.

1174
00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.433
I bet no one was allowed
to call him "Dan" or "Danny".

1175
00:46:27.567 --> 00:46:29.066
Oh. he hated that.

1176
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.467
Anyway. we were so in sync
for so many years.

1177
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.066
We were touring
the world together.

1178
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.066
at the top of our game.

1179
00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.934
in love.

1180
00:46:37.066 --> 00:46:37.967
I mean. everything was perfect.

1181
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.066
Until...

1182
00:46:40.433 --> 00:46:41.266
Until...

1183
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.066
one day in rehearsal. I fell.

1184
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.200
and I ended up getting
the same injury that you have

1185
00:46:45.333 --> 00:46:46.233
right there.

1186
00:46:46.367 --> 00:46:48.200
A grade-three high-ankle sprain.

1187
00:46:48.333 --> 00:46:50.700
with an almost
fully-torn ligament.

1188
00:46:50.834 --> 00:46:51.567
I honestly thought

1189
00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:52.467
I would just be
right back into it

1190
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.033
a few weeks later. but...

1191
00:46:54.166 --> 00:46:55.934
It took longer for you to heal
than everybody thought.

1192
00:46:56.066 --> 00:46:57.400
Yep.

1193
00:46:57.533 --> 00:46:59.133
But I wasn't worried about it.

1194
00:46:59.266 --> 00:47:00.600
I mean.
I knew when I was ready.

1195
00:47:00.734 --> 00:47:03.166
I would be right back in there
as prima ballerina.

1196
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.533
And I had no doubt that Daniel
or the ballet company

1197
00:47:05.667 --> 00:47:07.767
would be as loyal to me
as I had been to them.

1198
00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.166
I'm going to take a wild guess
that they weren't.

1199
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.166
Yeah.

1200
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.300
I was replaced by my understudy.

1201
00:47:14.433 --> 00:47:15.567
And then. a year later.

1202
00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.400
I found out
that she was engaged to Daniel.

1203
00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.000
I was just completely
pushed aside.

1204
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.567
That one injury
changed everything.

1205
00:47:28.767 --> 00:47:30.100
But. you know.

1206
00:47:30.233 --> 00:47:31.100
it was out of my control.

1207
00:47:31.233 --> 00:47:34.133
so I just had to adapt.

1208
00:47:34.266 --> 00:47:35.834
You make it sound so easy.

1209
00:47:35.967 --> 00:47:37.233
No. It... it wasn't.

1210
00:47:38.667 --> 00:47:40.233
But. you know. in the end.

1211
00:47:40.367 --> 00:47:41.967
I ended up realizing
that it was for the better.

1212
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.834
It's funny.
because I came back to Avon

1213
00:47:44.967 --> 00:47:47.533
to fix this property up
to sell it.

1214
00:47:47.667 --> 00:47:49.934
I ended up falling in love
with it all over again.

1215
00:47:50.066 --> 00:47:53.100
And I didn't regret
that decision until...

1216
00:47:53.233 --> 00:47:54.400
Until?

1217
00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.133
You know. I don't understand

1218
00:47:58.266 --> 00:48:00.667
how people can just walk away
from things so easily.

1219
00:48:02.066 --> 00:48:03.066
And this time from my studio.

1220
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.800
It's just really disappointing.

1221
00:48:06.033 --> 00:48:07.400
Yeah. I kind of feel
the same way about my team.

1222
00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.734
If I don't get back there soon.

1223
00:48:10.867 --> 00:48:12.700
they might not
be there for me anymore.

1224
00:48:15.834 --> 00:48:17.633
You're going to be okay. Coop.

1225
00:48:17.767 --> 00:48:19.066
No matter what.

1226
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.033
[♪♪]

1227
00:48:27.834 --> 00:48:29.166
You too.

1228
00:48:34.433 --> 00:48:35.867
Do you want some dessert?

1229
00:48:38.433 --> 00:48:39.800
Let me handle that.

1230
00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:42.633
Meet me outside in 10 minutes.

1231
00:48:44.133 --> 00:48:45.200
Okay.

1232
00:48:49.333 --> 00:48:51.567
Wow!

1233
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:52.934
What is this?

1234
00:48:53.066 --> 00:48:54.900
Well. you took care of dinner.
so I'm taking care of dessert.

1235
00:48:55.033 --> 00:48:56.200
S'mores night!

1236
00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:57.266
[together] S'mores night!

1237
00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.467
Thank you.

1238
00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.667
Guys. we haven't done this
in so long!

1239
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.667
Here you go.

1240
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.767
Ooh. thank you!

1241
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.734
Did you guys
help him set this up?

1242
00:49:09.867 --> 00:49:11.266
Nope. This was all him.

1243
00:49:12.967 --> 00:49:14.133
Pretty sweet of him. huh?

1244
00:49:14.266 --> 00:49:16.066
It is very sweet of him.
Who knew?

1245
00:49:17.266 --> 00:49:18.100
Take a marshmallow.

1246
00:49:18.233 --> 00:49:19.266
[Jenna] Oh. thank you.

1247
00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.600
[Matt] Wow. That's a beauty.

1248
00:49:23.734 --> 00:49:24.600
Give it a go.

1249
00:49:24.734 --> 00:49:26.834
-Yeah?
-[Ryan] Mm-hmm.

1250
00:49:27.967 --> 00:49:31.767
[♪♪]

1251
00:49:39.533 --> 00:49:41.166
Well. so you do know
a thing or two about hockey.

1252
00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:43.734
Maybe a little.

1253
00:49:45.767 --> 00:49:46.700
Where did you play?

1254
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.166
It was a long time ago.

1255
00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.266
But I had to stop.

1256
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.133
You got hurt?

1257
00:49:53.266 --> 00:49:54.600
No. my dad died.

1258
00:49:55.934 --> 00:49:57.400
I was the only one who could
take over his business.

1259
00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.000
So...

1260
00:50:00.133 --> 00:50:01.633
Yeah. I was actually

1261
00:50:01.767 --> 00:50:04.600
a couple days away from
getting drafted into the NHL.

1262
00:50:06.734 --> 00:50:07.600
Wow.

1263
00:50:07.734 --> 00:50:08.767
I guess me being here

1264
00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.900
kind of pours
salt in the wounds.

1265
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.934
At first. maybe.

1266
00:50:13.967 --> 00:50:14.800
But...

1267
00:50:14.934 --> 00:50:15.800
I mean. I know
you worked your tail off

1268
00:50:15.934 --> 00:50:16.967
to get to where you are.

1269
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:18.300
I respect that.

1270
00:50:18.433 --> 00:50:20.767
I respect what you did more--

1271
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.367
sacrificing your future
for your family.

1272
00:50:25.734 --> 00:50:26.767
Thanks. man.

1273
00:50:27.767 --> 00:50:28.767
Yeah.

1274
00:50:30.033 --> 00:50:31.767
[Jenna]
Who invented the s'more?

1275
00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:32.967
[Ryan] Oddly enough.

1276
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.567
it was my distant cousin
from Toronto. "Bob S'moore."

1277
00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:38.900
That is so not true.

1278
00:50:39.934 --> 00:50:40.800
It was the Girl Scouts.

1279
00:50:40.934 --> 00:50:41.900
Ah!

1280
00:50:42.033 --> 00:50:43.600
[Ryan] Believe what you want...

1281
00:50:44.934 --> 00:50:46.600
Hi. guys!

1282
00:50:46.734 --> 00:50:47.934
[Jenna] Oh. hey!
What are you doing here?

1283
00:50:48.066 --> 00:50:49.433
We saw the fire
on the way home.

1284
00:50:49.567 --> 00:50:50.667
wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

1285
00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.667
Yeah. we're just
making s'mores.

1286
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.767
Here. you want some?

1287
00:50:54.266 --> 00:50:55.300
Felix. how was your hockey game?

1288
00:50:55.433 --> 00:50:57.767
We won--
but I barely got on the ice.

1289
00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:58.667
They didn't let you play?

1290
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.066
They did--

1291
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.633
but every time I got the puck.
I just couldn't hold onto it.

1292
00:51:05.767 --> 00:51:06.667
Hey. Felix.

1293
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.800
I know a really great coach
here in town.

1294
00:51:08.934 --> 00:51:11.233
and I think
he's available tomorrow.

1295
00:51:11.367 --> 00:51:12.233
Is that okay. Dad?

1296
00:51:12.367 --> 00:51:13.333
Sure.

1297
00:51:14.633 --> 00:51:16.533
Matt. you mind giving me a ride
to the rink?

1298
00:51:16.667 --> 00:51:17.900
Yeah. no worries.

1299
00:51:18.834 --> 00:51:19.800
We'll pick you up at seven.

1300
00:51:21.633 --> 00:51:22.500
What's that all about?

1301
00:51:22.633 --> 00:51:23.900
You'll see.

1302
00:51:26.133 --> 00:51:28.133
You know what. guys.
this firewood is getting low.

1303
00:51:28.266 --> 00:51:29.400
Let me go grab some
from the barn.

1304
00:51:29.533 --> 00:51:31.400
I'll give you a hand.

1305
00:51:31.533 --> 00:51:32.400
[Jenna] Thank you.

1306
00:51:32.533 --> 00:51:33.333
I'm gonna run by you.

1307
00:51:33.467 --> 00:51:34.433
Thanks.

1308
00:51:36.834 --> 00:51:37.967
Oh. boy.

1309
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:39.133
Who wants a mallow?

1310
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.667
You know. this is
such a great space.

1311
00:51:47.967 --> 00:51:50.633
You ever think about
fixing this barn up.

1312
00:51:50.767 --> 00:51:52.100
teaching your classes in here?

1313
00:51:53.133 --> 00:51:54.166
That way. you wouldn't have to
worry about rent.

1314
00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.033
You'd be in complete control.

1315
00:51:55.166 --> 00:51:56.033
I know.

1316
00:51:56.166 --> 00:51:57.300
I tried.

1317
00:51:57.433 --> 00:51:59.800
but this is
a 200-year-old barn.

1318
00:51:59.934 --> 00:52:00.834
It's not up to code.

1319
00:52:00.967 --> 00:52:02.800
and it would cost a fortune
to convert.

1320
00:52:02.934 --> 00:52:03.900
My dad tried years ago.

1321
00:52:04.033 --> 00:52:06.300
when he wanted to make
this place a cider mill.

1322
00:52:06.433 --> 00:52:07.767
-Really?
-Yeah.

1323
00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.300
He wanted a tasting room.
a store. the whole thing.

1324
00:52:12.834 --> 00:52:14.300
That's a...

1325
00:52:14.433 --> 00:52:15.500
that's a wonderful dream.

1326
00:52:16.767 --> 00:52:18.367
I'm just sad he didn't get
to see it through.

1327
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.100
But you could.

1328
00:52:20.233 --> 00:52:21.800
If anyone can do it. it's you.

1329
00:52:22.934 --> 00:52:24.633
Come on.
how do you know that?

1330
00:52:24.767 --> 00:52:27.033
I mean.
we barely know each other.

1331
00:52:28.033 --> 00:52:31.667
Actually. you know me better
than almost anyone else.

1332
00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.734
I guess you know me better
than almost anyone else.

1333
00:52:41.233 --> 00:52:42.100
[footsteps approaching]

1334
00:52:42.233 --> 00:52:43.734
The fire's almost out.

1335
00:52:45.066 --> 00:52:46.767
I guess we better
get back out there.

1336
00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.333
Hey. Felix. help me
with this firewood.

1337
00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.333
All right.

1338
00:52:55.834 --> 00:52:58.500
[♪♪]

1339
00:52:58.633 --> 00:53:00.900
This is going to be awesome.

1340
00:53:01.033 --> 00:53:04.166
So. what exactly
is happening here?

1341
00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.433
Well. Felix needs help.

1342
00:53:05.567 --> 00:53:06.400
and I can't go on the ice.

1343
00:53:06.533 --> 00:53:08.900
so I need you to do it.

1344
00:53:09.033 --> 00:53:10.900
I... I don't have any skates.

1345
00:53:11.033 --> 00:53:12.166
I'm a professional
hockey player.

1346
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:13.400
I never leave home

1347
00:53:13.533 --> 00:53:14.967
without at least
three extra pairs.

1348
00:53:16.166 --> 00:53:17.200
And lucky for you...

1349
00:53:17.333 --> 00:53:20.133
we are basically the same size.

1350
00:53:22.667 --> 00:53:24.667
I... I haven't been
on the ice in years.

1351
00:53:25.633 --> 00:53:27.367
You'll be fine.
It's like riding a bicycle--

1352
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:28.533
except the bicycle

1353
00:53:28.667 --> 00:53:30.500
has sharp metal blades
on the bottom.

1354
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:35.300
[♪♪]

1355
00:53:35.433 --> 00:53:36.734
Ready?

1356
00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.900
[♪♪]

1357
00:53:45.033 --> 00:53:46.200
Well...

1358
00:53:46.333 --> 00:53:47.500
wish me luck.

1359
00:53:49.967 --> 00:53:54.333
[♪♪]

1360
00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:05.700
[Ryan] Hey!

1361
00:54:05.834 --> 00:54:07.133
Good job!

1362
00:54:10.066 --> 00:54:11.500
Okay. Felix.
show me what you got.

1363
00:54:18.533 --> 00:54:19.467
Ooh!

1364
00:54:22.867 --> 00:54:23.867
Incredible footwork. Felix.

1365
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.433
Yeah. amazing agility.

1366
00:54:25.567 --> 00:54:26.900
Yeah. until I get the puck.

1367
00:54:28.433 --> 00:54:29.333
Let's see.

1368
00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:31.633
Come on. come on.

1369
00:54:31.767 --> 00:54:33.467
You're up right here.

1370
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:36.066
Ready?

1371
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.567
[♪♪]

1372
00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:46.667
Ooh!

1373
00:54:52.734 --> 00:54:55.066
Hey. That's not as hard a fix
as you think.

1374
00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:56.800
You're just squeezing
that stick too tight.

1375
00:54:56.934 --> 00:54:58.367
All right. you gotta keep
those shoulders loose.

1376
00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.600
those arms.

1377
00:54:59.734 --> 00:55:01.100
Let that top hand
do most of the work. all right?

1378
00:55:01.233 --> 00:55:02.100
[Ryan] Listen to the man.

1379
00:55:02.233 --> 00:55:03.000
He knows
what he's talking about.

1380
00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:04.133
[Felix] I'll give it a try.

1381
00:55:04.266 --> 00:55:05.533
[Ryan] A tip that helped me
when I was your age--

1382
00:55:05.667 --> 00:55:08.934
think of a nonsense word
and say it over and over again.

1383
00:55:09.066 --> 00:55:10.133
What kind of word. though?

1384
00:55:10.266 --> 00:55:12.100
My personal favorite...

1385
00:55:12.233 --> 00:55:13.166
"flump".

1386
00:55:14.133 --> 00:55:15.467
-Never failed me.
-"Flump"?

1387
00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.100
Mm-hmm.

1388
00:55:17.233 --> 00:55:18.367
[Matt] All right. let's try it.

1389
00:55:20.934 --> 00:55:22.066
Flump.

1390
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.567
Flump! Flump!

1391
00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.867
Oh. yeah!
Nice shot. Felix!

1392
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.266
Hey. guys. look who's here.

1393
00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.667
-[Felix] Flump!
-Good job. Felix!

1394
00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:34.066
[Felix] Flump!

1395
00:55:34.967 --> 00:55:37.033
I am very proud of you
for staying off of the ice.

1396
00:55:37.166 --> 00:55:39.200
Well. I am not about
to mess this up.

1397
00:55:41.467 --> 00:55:42.600
I haven't seen you
smile like this

1398
00:55:42.734 --> 00:55:43.867
in such a long time.

1399
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.300
It's all part of
Coop's master plan.

1400
00:55:46.433 --> 00:55:47.600
Thank you. Coop.

1401
00:55:47.734 --> 00:55:49.000
Now there's no excuse

1402
00:55:49.133 --> 00:55:50.133
not to watch
the Rangers' game with me.

1403
00:55:50.266 --> 00:55:51.967
-Totally.
- Yes!

1404
00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.433
All right.
let's get back out there.

1405
00:55:56.233 --> 00:55:58.133
You know. the only reason
I said you couldn't lace up

1406
00:55:58.266 --> 00:56:01.133
is because you pushed yourself
way too hard last time.

1407
00:56:02.367 --> 00:56:03.233
But...

1408
00:56:03.367 --> 00:56:04.500
you know.

1409
00:56:04.633 --> 00:56:05.867
if you promise
to take it easy...

1410
00:56:06.834 --> 00:56:09.433
it might be helpful to see
how your ankle is feeling.

1411
00:56:09.567 --> 00:56:11.500
But the key words
are "take it easy."

1412
00:56:11.633 --> 00:56:12.667
Okay?

1413
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.133
Thank you!

1414
00:56:18.567 --> 00:56:19.934
Take it easy!

1415
00:56:21.867 --> 00:56:26.033
[♪♪]

1416
00:56:26.166 --> 00:56:27.633
[Jenna] Good job. you guys!

1417
00:56:29.367 --> 00:56:30.433
Awesome!

1418
00:56:34.567 --> 00:56:36.166
You looked really good
out there.

1419
00:56:37.567 --> 00:56:38.500
How does your ankle feel?

1420
00:56:38.633 --> 00:56:39.700
-It feels great!
-Yeah?

1421
00:56:39.834 --> 00:56:41.100
No pain at all.

1422
00:56:41.233 --> 00:56:42.166
That's so good!

1423
00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.400
This is the critical part.

1424
00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:44.500
You're getting
the strength you need.

1425
00:56:44.633 --> 00:56:45.433
now you just
have to build on that

1426
00:56:45.567 --> 00:56:47.367
to prevent re-injury.

1427
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.834
Well. you look like
you're having a lot of fun.

1428
00:56:48.967 --> 00:56:50.533
I haven't had
that much fun in years.

1429
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.667
Can we keep playing?

1430
00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:55.667
[Erin] It's getting late

1431
00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.567
and there's an ice storm
coming in.

1432
00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:57.600
We should all head home.

1433
00:56:57.734 --> 00:56:58.867
Okay.

1434
00:56:59.967 --> 00:57:01.834
Thank you so much. Matt.

1435
00:57:01.967 --> 00:57:02.834
And you. too. Coop.

1436
00:57:02.967 --> 00:57:04.767
Anytime. bud.

1437
00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:06.300
Hey. you think
if I keep doing ballet.

1438
00:57:06.433 --> 00:57:07.934
I can be as smooth
on my cuts as you?

1439
00:57:08.066 --> 00:57:09.200
Definitely.

1440
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.266
[Erin] We can take you
home. Felix.

1441
00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:12.600
[Felix] Thanks.

1442
00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:17.633
You know. you are

1443
00:57:17.767 --> 00:57:19.567
a really good person.
Ryan Cooper.

1444
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.367
I just saw a way

1445
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.567
of helping them both
at the same time.

1446
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:24.834
And you inspire people.

1447
00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.000
Not everyone can do that.

1448
00:57:32.266 --> 00:57:34.100
[thunder clapping]

1449
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:38.834
[♪♪]

1450
00:57:47.633 --> 00:57:49.633
[thunder clapping]

1451
00:57:49.767 --> 00:57:51.100
[power cuts out]

1452
00:57:51.233 --> 00:57:52.767
That figures.

1453
00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.333
[thunder rumbling]

1454
00:57:59.033 --> 00:58:00.633
[line ringing]

1455
00:58:00.767 --> 00:58:01.500
Hey.

1456
00:58:01.633 --> 00:58:02.800
Are you guys out. too?

1457
00:58:04.667 --> 00:58:05.533
Yeah. well.

1458
00:58:05.667 --> 00:58:07.333
you know what that means...

1459
00:58:07.467 --> 00:58:08.800
power outage game night!

1460
00:58:10.266 --> 00:58:11.400
Okay. can you
get over here safely?

1461
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.600
I'll see you guys soon. Bye.

1462
00:58:16.367 --> 00:58:17.500
[knocking on door]

1463
00:58:17.633 --> 00:58:18.834
That was fast!

1464
00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.867
Whoa!

1465
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.300
Okay...

1466
00:58:27.433 --> 00:58:28.500
I know my life
is "all about ice."

1467
00:58:28.633 --> 00:58:30.367
but even for me.
that is a bit much.

1468
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:31.800
You should not
have walked over here in this.

1469
00:58:31.934 --> 00:58:32.734
It's slippery out there.

1470
00:58:32.867 --> 00:58:34.033
You could have
tweaked your ankle.

1471
00:58:34.166 --> 00:58:35.600
Hey. I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

1472
00:58:36.767 --> 00:58:38.300
Oh!

1473
00:58:38.433 --> 00:58:40.367
Yes. yeah. thank you.

1474
00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.333
I...

1475
00:58:41.467 --> 00:58:43.233
I have my fireplace for heat.

1476
00:58:43.367 --> 00:58:44.233
and a gas stove.

1477
00:58:44.367 --> 00:58:46.033
and storm snacks.

1478
00:58:46.166 --> 00:58:47.667
Storm snacks--
that's not a thing.

1479
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.934
Oh. it so is.

1480
00:58:52.166 --> 00:58:53.400
[thunder rumbling]

1481
00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:59.166
Wow. Ballet dancers
eat junk food!

1482
00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:00.533
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1483
00:59:00.667 --> 00:59:02.734
I realized living
an "all or nothing" existence

1484
00:59:02.867 --> 00:59:04.266
isn't living at all.

1485
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.734
Then why aren't you
expanding your dance studio?

1486
00:59:07.266 --> 00:59:08.700
Because...

1487
00:59:10.333 --> 00:59:11.200
that's just...

1488
00:59:12.533 --> 00:59:13.500
that's different.

1489
00:59:15.667 --> 00:59:17.000
-Can I get some of that?
-Yeah.

1490
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.467
Oh!

1491
00:59:24.266 --> 00:59:25.633
Hey! We brought the poker set.

1492
00:59:25.767 --> 00:59:26.734
Okay. that is so not fair.

1493
00:59:26.867 --> 00:59:28.233
You know I can't bluff
to save my life.

1494
00:59:28.367 --> 00:59:30.133
But Ryan doesn't know that.

1495
00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:31.300
You should invite him over.

1496
00:59:31.433 --> 00:59:32.533
Oh. come on.

1497
00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:34.133
Everyone can see how you two
look at each other!

1498
00:59:34.266 --> 00:59:35.767
Just admit
there's something going on!

1499
00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:37.033
Stop.

1500
00:59:38.867 --> 00:59:39.834
Oops.

1501
00:59:43.033 --> 00:59:43.800
Hey. Coop.

1502
00:59:43.934 --> 00:59:44.900
Hi.

1503
00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:47.500
Matt.

1504
00:59:53.767 --> 00:59:56.166
Hmm. Okay.

1505
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.467
Who invited this guy?

1506
00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500
Well. it's just
you and me. Wagner.

1507
01:00:01.667 --> 01:00:02.734
What're you going to do?

1508
01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:06.467
I'm all in.

1509
01:00:07.433 --> 01:00:09.166
Ooh!

1510
01:00:18.667 --> 01:00:19.700
[laughs]

1511
01:00:19.834 --> 01:00:22.867
You have the worst "tell"
I have ever seen.

1512
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:23.867
[Jenna] What?

1513
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.266
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1514
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.233
Really? Okay.

1515
01:00:27.367 --> 01:00:28.233
I call.

1516
01:00:28.367 --> 01:00:29.900
I had eights!

1517
01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.867
So...

1518
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.533
what do I win?

1519
01:00:34.667 --> 01:00:36.133
"Power Outage Poker"
bragging rights.

1520
01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:38.367
-That's it?
-Yes. that's it.

1521
01:00:40.033 --> 01:00:41.133
I guess I can live with that.

1522
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.767
Wow. I can't believe
how late it is.

1523
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.400
Yeah? Oh. yeah.

1524
01:00:49.533 --> 01:00:52.200
We should get home
to start the generator--

1525
01:00:52.333 --> 01:00:53.867
because the power
could be out for hours.

1526
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.300
Are you sure it's safe to
walk?

1527
01:00:55.433 --> 01:00:56.600
Oh. please.
We're not newbies.

1528
01:00:56.734 --> 01:00:57.600
We brought the crampons.

1529
01:00:57.734 --> 01:00:58.533
We'll be fine.

1530
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.767
Well. I guess
I should get going. too.

1531
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.767
Wolf Pack has conditioning
all morning.

1532
01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.800
Assuming the roads get opened.

1533
01:01:07.934 --> 01:01:08.934
Oh. yeah.

1534
01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:10.500
and I have my make-up rehearsal
for Winterfest.

1535
01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:11.867
I'll get you my crampons.

1536
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.633
No! I left those at the studio.

1537
01:01:14.767 --> 01:01:15.667
Oh...

1538
01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.300
I'm sure I'll be fine.

1539
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.367
Oh! Absolutely not.

1540
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:24.767
If you slip and get hurt.
I will never forgive myself.

1541
01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.500
Well. I'm not sure
what else to do

1542
01:01:26.633 --> 01:01:28.033
besides sleeping on your couch
till morning.

1543
01:01:29.233 --> 01:01:30.367
Oh. um...

1544
01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.734
yeah. that's fine.

1545
01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.834
Well. except
with the power out.

1546
01:01:33.967 --> 01:01:36.000
the living room
is the only one with heat.

1547
01:01:36.133 --> 01:01:37.266
so I was going to sleep
on the couch. too.

1548
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.834
but technically.
it's two separate couches.

1549
01:01:39.967 --> 01:01:42.033
so. I mean. it's fine.

1550
01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:43.500
Are you sure?

1551
01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:44.734
Yeah. I'm sure.

1552
01:01:49.633 --> 01:01:51.533
[thunder clapping]

1553
01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.066
So do all your guests
get this level of service?

1554
01:02:02.166 --> 01:02:03.133
Yes.

1555
01:02:06.734 --> 01:02:07.700
Goodnight.

1556
01:02:09.033 --> 01:02:10.166
Goodnight.

1557
01:02:13.734 --> 01:02:17.967
[♪♪]

1558
01:02:26.734 --> 01:02:28.000
[phone ringing]

1559
01:02:32.567 --> 01:02:33.867
Hello?

1560
01:02:35.333 --> 01:02:36.800
Wait. what?

1561
01:02:36.934 --> 01:02:37.934
Are you serious?

1562
01:02:39.667 --> 01:02:41.300
Okay. Um. all right.

1563
01:02:41.433 --> 01:02:43.367
just keep me updated
when you hear more.

1564
01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.867
All right. bye.

1565
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.066
Morning.

1566
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.266
What's wrong?

1567
01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.367
A power line went down
in front of the studio.

1568
01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:52.367
so now I can't get in.

1569
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.800
which means another rehearsal
is canceled.

1570
01:02:54.934 --> 01:02:56.900
so we are two days behind.

1571
01:02:57.033 --> 01:02:59.500
Well. I've seen the dancers
practicing on their own.

1572
01:02:59.633 --> 01:03:01.066
They know the routine.

1573
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.333
I know.

1574
01:03:02.467 --> 01:03:03.633
but the difference
between a good performance

1575
01:03:03.767 --> 01:03:04.800
and a great one

1576
01:03:04.934 --> 01:03:07.233
is being so prepared.
the dance is second nature.

1577
01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:09.567
Well. there's nothing
you can do about it.

1578
01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.367
and I'm sure they'll call
if something changes.

1579
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.834
You know. why don't you
come to the rink with me today?

1580
01:03:15.967 --> 01:03:16.800
It's about time
you saw a bit of my world.

1581
01:03:16.934 --> 01:03:18.934
I've spent
a lot of time in yours.

1582
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.600
I'd love that.

1583
01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:24.834
[Jenna] Wow.

1584
01:03:28.934 --> 01:03:30.233
Where is everybody?

1585
01:03:30.367 --> 01:03:31.767
Oh. practice is canceled.

1586
01:03:33.033 --> 01:03:35.133
If practice is canceled.
what are we doing here?

1587
01:03:35.266 --> 01:03:36.000
Like I said.

1588
01:03:36.133 --> 01:03:37.133
I wanted you to see

1589
01:03:37.266 --> 01:03:38.333
how I spend
the other half of my day.

1590
01:03:38.467 --> 01:03:39.734
and I thought...

1591
01:03:42.266 --> 01:03:44.900
I could show you how I destress.

1592
01:03:45.033 --> 01:03:46.667
You conned me?

1593
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.433
I thought it was my turn
to teach you something for once.

1594
01:03:50.567 --> 01:03:53.233
Ryan. I didn't say
I don't know how to ice skate.

1595
01:03:53.367 --> 01:03:54.333
I said I didn't like it.

1596
01:03:54.467 --> 01:03:57.100
Well. that's not
all we're doing.

1597
01:03:59.734 --> 01:04:03.133
[♪♪]

1598
01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.567
[Jenna laughing]

1599
01:04:06.567 --> 01:04:08.200
That's it.
just keep leaning forward.

1600
01:04:08.333 --> 01:04:09.300
You're doing great!

1601
01:04:10.633 --> 01:04:11.500
I can't stop...

1602
01:04:11.633 --> 01:04:12.600
I can't stop!

1603
01:04:13.467 --> 01:04:14.867
[Ryan] I got you.

1604
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.500
-Okay...
-Whoa. whoa.

1605
01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.433
[Ryan] Just follow my lead.

1606
01:04:21.033 --> 01:04:22.000
You saved me.

1607
01:04:23.433 --> 01:04:24.767
You saved me.

1608
01:04:25.867 --> 01:04:26.834
Is your ankle feeling better?

1609
01:04:27.834 --> 01:04:29.233
I'm not talking about my ankle.

1610
01:04:33.133 --> 01:04:35.800
[♪♪]

1611
01:04:35.934 --> 01:04:37.633
The rink is a great place
to destress.

1612
01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:39.834
The cool air.

1613
01:04:39.967 --> 01:04:41.767
the sound of blades
on the ice...

1614
01:04:45.767 --> 01:04:46.633
What do you think?

1615
01:04:46.767 --> 01:04:48.000
It's amazing.

1616
01:04:52.967 --> 01:04:54.266
-Oh. ho!
-Oh. yeah!

1617
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.066
-Yeah!
-Come on!

1618
01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.200
Oh!

1619
01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.200
[both] Oh!

1620
01:05:05.433 --> 01:05:06.433
-[Jenna] Yes!
-[phone chimes]

1621
01:05:06.567 --> 01:05:07.834
[Jenna] Oh. can you hold this?

1622
01:05:09.433 --> 01:05:10.967
Hey. Main Street's clear!

1623
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:13.600
I'm going to be able to do
the one o'clock class after all.

1624
01:05:13.734 --> 01:05:14.700
Come on.

1625
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.633
Oh. I'm going to hang
these flyers

1626
01:05:17.767 --> 01:05:18.467
around the neighborhood

1627
01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.667
before my class gets here.

1628
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:21.700
I can help.

1629
01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.133
Okay. Let's go.

1630
01:05:25.734 --> 01:05:27.133
-I'll get this.
-Thanks.

1631
01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:41.367
[♪♪]

1632
01:05:48.567 --> 01:05:49.433
[Jenna] Unbelievable.

1633
01:05:49.567 --> 01:05:50.800
What?

1634
01:05:50.934 --> 01:05:51.800
We were supposed to be
the grand finale.

1635
01:05:51.934 --> 01:05:52.800
but the Dance Company

1636
01:05:52.934 --> 01:05:54.266
must've talked
to the organizers

1637
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.266
because now
they're performing last.

1638
01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.400
Sounds like they're pulling
a power play.

1639
01:05:57.533 --> 01:05:58.367
Do you really think so?

1640
01:05:58.500 --> 01:05:59.867
Yup.

1641
01:06:00.066 --> 01:06:01.600
but just like in hockey.

1642
01:06:01.734 --> 01:06:02.800
don't let it fluster you.

1643
01:06:02.934 --> 01:06:04.100
defend your house.

1644
01:06:04.233 --> 01:06:05.767
and when it's your turn...

1645
01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.000
make it count.

1646
01:06:07.133 --> 01:06:08.900
You know. I'm going to do that.
Thank you.

1647
01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.867
Who knew that hockey and ballet
were so similar?

1648
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.767
Come on.

1649
01:06:19.066 --> 01:06:20.066
Hey. Felix.

1650
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.166
we're meeting up at the rink.
do you want to play?

1651
01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.166
[Felix] Can't.

1652
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.834
I have dance.

1653
01:06:23.967 --> 01:06:24.934
Hey. Felix!

1654
01:06:25.066 --> 01:06:26.233
-So what's up?
-Hey. Coop.

1655
01:06:27.266 --> 01:06:28.300
You're Ryan Cooper.

1656
01:06:28.433 --> 01:06:29.500
What are you doing here?

1657
01:06:29.633 --> 01:06:31.633
A little dance rehab
for my ankle.

1658
01:06:31.767 --> 01:06:33.367
A lot of pro athletes
are doing it now

1659
01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.033
because ballet is a total thing.

1660
01:06:37.066 --> 01:06:38.767
In fact. Felix has
better footwork than me

1661
01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:40.333
because of it.

1662
01:06:40.467 --> 01:06:41.333
[Jenna] Okay. guys.

1663
01:06:41.467 --> 01:06:42.433
let's get to class.

1664
01:06:42.567 --> 01:06:43.800
See you guys later.

1665
01:06:47.266 --> 01:06:50.200
You know. maybe this
doesn't need to be a one-off.

1666
01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:51.133
What do you mean?

1667
01:06:51.266 --> 01:06:52.533
Helping me.

1668
01:06:52.667 --> 01:06:54.166
Why not make athletic training

1669
01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:55.834
part of what your studio
has to offer?

1670
01:06:55.967 --> 01:06:57.200
Oh...

1671
01:06:57.333 --> 01:06:58.633
It could be big business.

1672
01:06:58.767 --> 01:07:00.066
I could set you up
with meetings

1673
01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.533
with all the major trainers
on the East Coast.

1674
01:07:02.533 --> 01:07:03.600
I appreciate that.

1675
01:07:03.734 --> 01:07:04.734
but I just don't think

1676
01:07:04.867 --> 01:07:06.000
that's the right direction
for me or my studio.

1677
01:07:06.133 --> 01:07:08.900
Okay. you don't want to do
dance competitions.

1678
01:07:09.033 --> 01:07:10.266
you're not open
to athletic training.

1679
01:07:11.533 --> 01:07:13.834
I'm going to tell you
what Terry told me.

1680
01:07:13.967 --> 01:07:15.000
You gotta do something

1681
01:07:15.133 --> 01:07:16.600
because you're running
out of options.

1682
01:07:16.734 --> 01:07:18.600
Right. but training people
to win trophies

1683
01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:21.166
is literally the exact opposite
of my philosophy.

1684
01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.100
Well. like I had to learn

1685
01:07:23.233 --> 01:07:24.433
to be more flexible
to reach my goal.

1686
01:07:24.567 --> 01:07:27.934
maybe you need to learn
to bend a little. too.

01:12:09.467 --> 01:12:10.567
That's really soon.

1802
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:11.567
You made this possible. Jenna.

1803
01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:12.600
Thank you!

1804
01:12:12.734 --> 01:12:14.000
Oh...

1805
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.367
I am so happy for you.

1806
01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:21.800
Terry. could you
give us a minute?

1807
01:12:22.734 --> 01:12:24.967
Of course. Yeah.

1808
01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.333
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1809
01:12:28.467 --> 01:12:30.433
I mean. he's right.

1810
01:12:30.567 --> 01:12:32.767
I couldn't have done this
without you.

1811
01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.000
I'm just sorry
you're going to miss the show.

1812
01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:36.700
Jenna. I really. really wish
I could be there.

1813
01:12:36.834 --> 01:12:37.867
Hey. stop.

1814
01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.100
This is way more important.

1815
01:12:40.233 --> 01:12:41.367
Well. maybe I can talk
to Terry.

1816
01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.367
he can talk to Coach.

1817
01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:43.600
I can get an extra day.

1818
01:12:43.734 --> 01:12:44.700
You can't do that.

1819
01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.333
This is what you came here for.

1820
01:12:47.467 --> 01:12:48.934
And now you're back on the team.

1821
01:12:49.066 --> 01:12:50.500
This is everything you wanted.

1822
01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:52.967
Of course you have to go.

1823
01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:55.667
I just really wish
we had more time.

1824
01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.600
It was only ever
supposed to be 30 days.

1825
01:12:58.734 --> 01:12:59.633
We both knew that.

1826
01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.600
And now that time is up.

1827
01:13:05.767 --> 01:13:07.066
Hey. Terry.

1828
01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.066
can you give Ryan
a ride back to my place?

1829
01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.100
[Terry] Sure.
You're not coming with?

1830
01:13:11.233 --> 01:13:12.600
[Jenna] You know. I just have
so much to do at the studio

1831
01:13:12.734 --> 01:13:13.967
before tomorrow.

1832
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.266
But. hey...

1833
01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:18.867
you're going to be great!

1834
01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:25.667
Thank you.

1835
01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:29.667
Good luck.

1836
01:13:35.633 --> 01:13:36.834
[Ryan] Hey.

1837
01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.767
[♪♪]

1838
01:13:48.567 --> 01:13:52.934
[♪♪]

1839
01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.133
Go get 'em. Coop.

1840
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:17.867
[Erin] Jenna!

1841
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.700
Did you know
Ryan's playing today?

1842
01:14:19.834 --> 01:14:21.000
What?

1843
01:14:21.133 --> 01:14:22.734
I thought he was only going
to start practicing with them.

1844
01:14:22.867 --> 01:14:24.133
Apparently not.

1845
01:14:24.266 --> 01:14:26.533
[announcer] And the score
remains two-all.

1846
01:14:26.667 --> 01:14:30.300
We're 15 seconds into overtime
with a tied game...

1847
01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:31.400
Don't you want to watch him?

1848
01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:33.300
Um. I have to get ready
for the show.

1849
01:14:34.867 --> 01:14:36.200
Heading into the far corner.

1850
01:14:36.333 --> 01:14:39.133
and. oh. my.
Cooper. with an intercept.

1851
01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:41.300
headed toward the net.

1852
01:14:41.433 --> 01:14:42.967
He takes a shot. he scores!

1853
01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.333
He scored! He scored!

1854
01:14:45.467 --> 01:14:48.800
Ryan Cooper
wins the game for the Rangers

1855
01:14:48.934 --> 01:14:49.734
in overtime!

1856
01:14:49.867 --> 01:14:52.200
-Way to go. Coop.
-Unbelievable!

1857
01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:53.200
You okay?

1858
01:14:53.333 --> 01:14:55.066
Of course I am.

1859
01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.066
I'm happy for him.

1860
01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.400
He's doing
what he was meant to do.

1861
01:14:57.533 --> 01:14:59.033
and so am I.

1862
01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:00.834
But can't you find a way
to make this work?

1863
01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.367
This is what he wanted.

1864
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.133
Well. at first. maybe.

1865
01:15:06.266 --> 01:15:07.400
but now I think he wants

1866
01:15:07.533 --> 01:15:09.166
a little more
of what he found here.

1867
01:15:10.734 --> 01:15:12.367
I just want him to be happy.

1868
01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.800
What about you?

1869
01:15:17.734 --> 01:15:18.867
I'm really going to miss him.

1870
01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.133
Oh. honey.

1871
01:15:24.233 --> 01:15:25.600
[announcer] And here's
your first star

1872
01:15:25.734 --> 01:15:28.200
on your New York Rangers...

1873
01:15:28.333 --> 01:15:30.333
Ryan Cooper!

1874
01:15:41.433 --> 01:15:43.433
[Coach] You looked 10 years
younger out there. Coop.

1875
01:15:43.567 --> 01:15:44.567
Glad to have you back.

1876
01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:45.867
Thank you.

1877
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.633
Hey. do you mind
if I skip the press conference?

1878
01:15:47.767 --> 01:15:49.367
Why? You have
somewhere else to be?

1879
01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.266
Funny you should ask.

1880
01:15:52.867 --> 01:15:55.633
[♪♪]

1881
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.633
Okay. you guys. we're up next.

1882
01:16:01.767 --> 01:16:03.834
I want you to go out there
and have fun.

1883
01:16:03.967 --> 01:16:05.400
You already put in
all the hard work.

1884
01:16:05.533 --> 01:16:07.533
The rest
will take care of itself.

1885
01:16:07.667 --> 01:16:08.934
Okay?

1886
01:16:09.066 --> 01:16:10.467
Hey. Jenna.

1887
01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.233
Oh. hi. Mayor Andreen.

1888
01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:13.900
Are the kids ready to go on?

1889
01:16:14.033 --> 01:16:15.533
Yes. they absolutely are.

1890
01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:16.533
You know. everyone in town

1891
01:16:16.667 --> 01:16:17.533
is talking about

1892
01:16:17.667 --> 01:16:19.600
how you got Ryan Cooper
back to the NHL.

1893
01:16:19.734 --> 01:16:20.734
Really?

1894
01:16:21.767 --> 01:16:23.266
I didn't think that many people
knew he was here.

1895
01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:25.133
Are you kidding?

1896
01:16:25.266 --> 01:16:26.800
Of course we did.

1897
01:16:26.934 --> 01:16:28.367
We just didn't want
to bug the man.

1898
01:16:30.367 --> 01:16:32.233
You know.
my son's football team

1899
01:16:32.367 --> 01:16:33.633
heard from some of
the hockey kids

1900
01:16:33.767 --> 01:16:34.767
that ballet training

1901
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.133
would give them
more agility on the field

1902
01:16:36.266 --> 01:16:37.300
and help them win more games.

1903
01:16:37.433 --> 01:16:39.567
[Ryan] But ballet
isn't really about winning.

1904
01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:43.734
-Hi!
-Hi.

1905
01:16:46.767 --> 01:16:47.900
I have so much to say to you.

1906
01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.100
I thought we said everything
that needed to be said.

1907
01:16:51.233 --> 01:16:53.867
We didn't say anything
that needed to be said.

1908
01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:55.834
[mayor] Ryan Cooper.
you're here!

1909
01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.500
Ryan. this is Mayor Andreen.

1910
01:16:58.633 --> 01:17:00.633
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure's all mine.

1911
01:17:00.767 --> 01:17:02.734
Are you going to be
a part of the show now?

1912
01:17:02.867 --> 01:17:05.100
Well. I'm not officially
a member of the company.

1913
01:17:05.233 --> 01:17:06.834
Yes. you are.

1914
01:17:06.967 --> 01:17:09.300
You worked just as hard
as everyone else.

1915
01:17:09.433 --> 01:17:11.967
Well. I would
if I knew the routine.

1916
01:17:13.166 --> 01:17:14.700
But if you don't mind...

1917
01:17:14.834 --> 01:17:15.800
may I introduce them?

1918
01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:18.033
The mic's all yours.

1919
01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.133
Thank you.

1920
01:17:20.367 --> 01:17:21.333
Let's go.

1921
01:17:36.967 --> 01:17:38.166
Good evening.

1922
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.433
I'm Ryan Cooper.

1923
01:17:39.567 --> 01:17:40.834
Coop!

1924
01:17:40.967 --> 01:17:41.834
[cheering]

1925
01:17:41.967 --> 01:17:43.033
Thanks.

1926
01:17:45.467 --> 01:17:46.533
You know. it was nice
to hear that again

1927
01:17:46.667 --> 01:17:47.633
my first game back.

1928
01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:49.967
And I wouldn't have been there

1929
01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.433
if it wasn't for
my incredible teacher...

1930
01:17:53.567 --> 01:17:55.133
Jenna Wagner.

1931
01:17:55.266 --> 01:17:57.066
[applause and cheering]

1932
01:18:07.734 --> 01:18:09.266
Opening myself up to ballet

1933
01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.800
not only made me
a better athlete.

1934
01:18:12.934 --> 01:18:14.400
it made me a more humble.

1935
01:18:14.533 --> 01:18:15.700
more flexible.

1936
01:18:15.834 --> 01:18:17.367
and more balanced person.

1937
01:18:19.533 --> 01:18:21.800
And Jenna showed me...

1938
01:18:21.934 --> 01:18:24.400
that even if I never play
pro hockey ever again--

1939
01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.400
which I fully plan on doing
by the way...

1940
01:18:26.533 --> 01:18:28.333
[laughter]

1941
01:18:28.467 --> 01:18:29.734
...that I don't have to fear
my future.

1942
01:18:29.867 --> 01:18:31.500
because. no matter what happens.

1943
01:18:31.633 --> 01:18:35.200
I know I'll be okay...

1944
01:18:35.333 --> 01:18:36.934
because of her.

1945
01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.233
Ah! I almost forgot

1946
01:18:39.367 --> 01:18:40.867
the most important thing
I learned...

1947
01:18:50.233 --> 01:18:51.834
[wild cheering]

1948
01:18:51.967 --> 01:18:53.433
Yes!

1949
01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.100
Now "For the Love of Dance"...

1950
01:18:59.233 --> 01:19:02.333
the incredible
Avon Ballet Studio.

1951
01:19:02.467 --> 01:19:04.000
[cheering]

1952
01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:13.700
[♪♪]

1953
01:19:21.934 --> 01:19:26.467
[♪♪]

1954
01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.033
[♪♪]

1955

1957

[♪♪]

1958
01:20:08.934 --> 01:20:13.433
[♪♪]

1959
01:20:15.934 --> 01:20:17.066

[wild applause]

1961
01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.266
So good.

1962
01:20:29.266 --> 01:20:30.834
[applause and cheering]

1963
01:20:35.433 --> 01:20:38.367
[♪♪]

1964
01:20:42.633 --> 01:20:45.233
You guys. I am so proud of you.

1965
01:20:45.367 --> 01:20:47.734
That was the best show
you've ever done.

1966
01:20:47.867 --> 01:20:49.400
[applause]

1967
01:20:58.967 --> 01:21:00.233
[woman] Excuse me. Mr. Cooper.

1968
01:21:00.367 --> 01:21:02.166
would you mind signing
an autograph for my son?

1969
01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:03.800
Yeah. of course.

1970
01:21:05.166 --> 01:21:06.867
There you go.

1971
01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.633
Can we talk
somewhere more private?

1972
01:21:08.767 --> 01:21:09.834
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1973
01:21:13.467 --> 01:21:14.367
I have to ask.

1974
01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.867
how did you make it here
so quickly?

1975
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.734
I took the owner's helicopter.

1976
01:21:19.767 --> 01:21:21.467
Wow! Of course you did.

1977
01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.633
Well. I'm really glad
you could make the show.

1978
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.467
That's not
the only reason I'm here.

1979
01:21:29.266 --> 01:21:30.533
Well. I thought
getting back to the team

1980
01:21:30.667 --> 01:21:31.533
was all you wanted.

1981
01:21:31.667 --> 01:21:34.200
It was...

1982
01:21:34.333 --> 01:21:35.633
until I met you.

1983
01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:38.867
Don't you have to get back
to your real life?

1984
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.333
This is more real

1985
01:21:40.467 --> 01:21:43.000
than anything in New York
or any place else.

1986
01:21:43.133 --> 01:21:44.467
Yeah. right.

1987
01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.000
Plus. there's no rule that says

1988
01:21:46.133 --> 01:21:48.333
I have to stay in New York
during the off-season.

1989
01:21:48.467 --> 01:21:49.567
Mm.

1990
01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:51.300
Those moments together.
off the ice.

1991
01:21:51.433 --> 01:21:52.533
being close with you--

1992
01:21:52.667 --> 01:21:54.934
that is what
life is all about.

1993
01:21:57.767 --> 01:21:59.533
I believe in Denmark
they have a word for it.

1994
01:21:59.667 --> 01:22:00.867
[chuckles]

1995
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.033
What is it?

1996
01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:03.467
Ah. yeah. "hygge."

1997
01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.734
Oh!

1998
01:22:04.867 --> 01:22:06.300
You actually said it right.

1999
01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:08.900
I know you've been hurt

2000
01:22:09.033 --> 01:22:11.033
by people
who are here one minute.

2001
01:22:11.166 --> 01:22:12.033
gone the next.

2002
01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:15.100
but I swear.
I will never do that to you.

2003
01:22:16.133 --> 01:22:17.633
Nothing's going to change
how I feel about you.

2004
01:22:17.767 --> 01:22:19.533
And when I'm not playing
hockey.

2005
01:22:19.667 --> 01:22:20.900
I will always come back.

2006
01:22:23.233 --> 01:22:25.934
I just...

2007
01:22:26.066 --> 01:22:27.900
need to know if you want me to.

2008
01:22:30.266 --> 01:22:31.633
I want that.

2009
01:22:31.767 --> 01:22:33.800
More than anything in the
world.

2010
01:22:36.266 --> 01:22:37.266
I love you. Jenna Wagner.

2011
01:22:53.066 --> 01:22:55.000
I love you. Ryan Cooper.
