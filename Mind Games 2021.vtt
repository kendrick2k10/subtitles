00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:26.164
(pensive piano music)

4
00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:37.870
(door knocking)

5
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.150
- [Man] Captain?

6
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.983
- Sir.

7
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.180
- Well. that's not exactly a view

8
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.097
of the Afghani desert. ain't it?

9
00:01:47.097 --> 00:01:49.880
But I understand there's a Chick-Fil-A

10
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.083
right within arm's reach so there's that.

11
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.680
- It's a beautiful office. sir.

12
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.703
Thank you very much.

13
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.960
- Captain. I'd like to suggest
you decorate the place.

14
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.073
Make it a little more homey. okay?

15
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.920
A lot of the soldiers
returned from deployment

16
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.190
where they've seen a lot of shit.

17
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.203
Excuse my French.

18
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.793
- Yes. sir. I completely understand.

19
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.370
And I promise to do
everything in my powers

20
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.670
to help these brave heroes

21
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.063
and get them back on track
to healthy civilian lives.

22
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.620
- Good.

23
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.630
So if there's anything
you need. anything at all.

24
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.230
I'm just a couple hallways away.

25
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.533
- [Captain] Yes. sir.

26
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.650
- Hey Jake.

27
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.300
- Brian.
- Good to see you. man.

28
00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:46.410
Megan. how you doin'?

29
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.505
- [Megan] Hey. good.

30
00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:49.040
- Do I have any more
appointments for the evening?

31
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.050
- Yes. I was actually
getting ready to call you up

32
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.510
because you do have one more.

33
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.260
I just have to confirm his details.

34
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.790
- You know what. I'll take it from here.

35
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.730
- Oh no. it's no problem.

36
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.640
I mean I just have to-
- No. I insist.

37
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.473
Thank you.

38
00:03:03.024 --> 00:03:04.610
- Okay.

39
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:05.443
You sure?

40
00:03:05.443 --> 00:03:06.723
- Yeah. enjoy your weekend.

41
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.873
- [Megan] If you insist.

42
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.244
Have a good day. sir.

43
00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:21.411
- You as well.

44
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.087
- [Brian] Thank you for your patience.

45
00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:27.050
- Please. I just wanted to drop by.

46
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.280
see how things are going.

47
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.930
I just wanted to make sure

48
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.173
everything's going smoothly on the inside.

49
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.120
- Right this way.

50
00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:53.011
(pensive music)

51
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.133
(vehicle clattering)

52
00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:35.888
(birds chirping)

53
00:04:35.888 --> 00:04:38.388
(light music)

54
00:04:41.357 --> 00:04:43.273
- Mmm. that is so happy.

55
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.346
- [Woman] So. did she finish the dress?

56
00:04:47.346 --> 00:04:48.179
- Mhmm.

57
00:04:50.188 --> 00:04:52.688
It's so beautiful. so perfect.

58
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.075
It's more beautiful than I
ever could have imagined it.

59
00:04:57.075 --> 00:04:59.793
Ah. I'm so excited!

60
00:05:01.264 --> 00:05:04.505
- Hey. I'm sorry that I can't be there.

61
00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:07.630
- Mhmm. I'm sorry too. Missy.

62
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.583
So not okay.

63
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.740
Seriously. how's your mom doing?

64
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.832
- The doctor's are changing
up the medication again.

65
00:05:21.975 --> 00:05:25.150
We just have to wait and see.

66
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.552
I am so happy for you though.

67
00:05:27.552 --> 00:05:29.954
You don't even know how good you got it.

68
00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:33.287
A great man. a happy family. a fun life.

69
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:38.603
- My life?

70
00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.082
Yeah. yeah. you're right.

71
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.525
I mean I wouldn't call it perfect.

72
00:05:44.525 --> 00:05:46.107
but after so long.
everything's finally going

73
00:05:46.107 --> 00:05:48.860
in the right direction. you know?

74
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.000
Brian and I just put in
an offer on the house.

75
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.733
So we can finally say goodbye
to the landlords here.

76
00:05:57.298 --> 00:06:00.167
- Right. if anyone deserves it. it's you.

77
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.023
Everything you've been
through. losing the baby.

78
00:06:08.012 --> 00:06:10.429
Ugh. Tara. I'm such an idiot.

79
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.380
I'm so sorry. Tara. I
shouldn't have brought it up.

80
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.068
I should have just been happy for you.

81
00:06:17.068 --> 00:06:19.651
(somber music)

82
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.163
- No. it's okay.

83
00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:35.413
Hey. Jules. it's okay.

84
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.593
You're still my best friend.

85
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.183
Hey. I still love you okay?

86
00:06:46.183 --> 00:06:49.409
(door knocking)

87
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:50.540
Hey Jules. I need to let you go.

88
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.940
I think those are the cards.

89
00:06:54.102 --> 00:06:55.630
(chuckling) Yeah. I need to let you go.

90
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.247
Bye. I love you. talk to you later.

91
00:06:57.247 --> 00:06:58.493
Mwah mwah mwah. bye.

92
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.310
Hi.

93
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.320
Are these the cards?

94
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.210
- You need to sign.

95
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.780
- Okay.

96
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.673
Okay. yeah.

97
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.253
Yeah. right there.

98
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.973
Great.

99
00:07:17.662 --> 00:07:19.136
- [Delivery Guy] There you go.

100
00:07:19.136 --> 00:07:21.670
- Okay. thank you so much.

101
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.973
(ominous music)

102
00:07:23.973 --> 00:07:26.556
(Tara gasping)

103
00:07:44.723 --> 00:07:47.306
(Tara panting)

104
00:08:03.119 --> 00:08:05.869
(pulse thumping)

105
00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:14.833
What the fuck?

106
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.197
What the fuck?

107
00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:26.306
(grunting) What the fuck?

108
00:08:33.953 --> 00:08:34.982
Hello?

109
00:08:34.982 --> 00:08:36.374
Hello?

110
00:08:36.374 --> 00:08:37.842
(knocking)

111
00:08:37.842 --> 00:08:40.010
Is there anyone out there?

112
00:08:45.004 --> 00:08:48.687
Oh my god! (whimpering)

113
00:08:48.687 --> 00:08:50.790
Someone help me!

114
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:55.790
What the fuck is this? (whimpering)

115
00:08:56.346 --> 00:08:57.179
Help!

116
00:08:58.158 --> 00:08:58.991
Help!

117
00:09:03.352 --> 00:09:05.269
What's happening to me?

118
00:09:10.902 --> 00:09:12.073
Why is this happening to me?

119
00:09:12.073 --> 00:09:13.388
- I give people pills and tell them

120
00:09:13.388 --> 00:09:15.209
to call me in the morning.

121
00:09:15.209 --> 00:09:17.626
I don't actually help people.

122
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.136
- Yeah.

123
00:09:25.136 --> 00:09:27.283
Yeah it's the best feeling
in the world. actually.

124
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.100
Helping people overcome their fears.

125
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.200
dealing with their inner demons.

126
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.390
- You're kinda like a priest.

127
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.413
exorcising demons.

128
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.583
- Brian. the demons aren't real though.

129
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.220
It's just in their minds.

130
00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.433
I help them correct their thought process.

131
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.860
force them to face reality.

132
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.923
or my interpretation of it.

133
00:10:05.769 --> 00:10:06.819
It brings them peace.

134
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.873
- Well the point is you help people.

135
00:10:13.768 --> 00:10:14.868
- You really think so?

136
00:10:18.426 --> 00:10:22.093
Hello?

137
00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:24.760
(door slamming)

138
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.430
Who are you?

139
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.280
What do you want?

140
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.303
Please let me go.

141
00:10:34.303 --> 00:10:35.136
just let me go please.

142
00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:35.969
- Shh.

143
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.243
In good time.

144
00:10:43.415 --> 00:10:44.333
All in good time.

145
00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:51.391
(plastic bag rustling)

146
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.980
- Can I use the bathroom?

147
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.303
- Your chain will reach to the bathroom.

148
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.993
You're not an animal.

149
00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:25.223
Yet.

150
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.333
- I don't know who you are

151
00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:31.820
but you have the wrong person.

152
00:11:33.353 --> 00:11:35.436
Please let me go. please.

153
00:11:36.569 --> 00:11:38.107
Please.

154
00:11:38.107 --> 00:11:39.899
I won't tell anyone. I won't.

155
00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:42.899
- I'll pull your fucking tongue out.

156
00:11:53.582 --> 00:11:54.415
- Please let me go. please.

157
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.823
Please let me go.

158
00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.493
- In time.

159
00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.260
In time.

160
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.163
All in good time.

161
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.680
- No. no. no.

162
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.878
No. no. no. please. please. please!

163
00:12:09.878 --> 00:12:11.128
Please. no. no!

164
00:12:12.725 --> 00:12:13.558
Please!

165
00:12:14.712 --> 00:12:15.545
No!

166
00:12:16.384 --> 00:12:18.217
I just want to be out!

167
00:12:19.499 --> 00:12:21.416

(door creaking)

180
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:21.683
- Tara?

181
00:14:34.644 --> 00:14:36.394
What did she buy now?

182
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.773
Oh.

183
00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:56.477
Wow.

184
00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:00.779
How sweet.

185
00:15:03.787 --> 00:15:04.620
Hm.

186
00:15:17.641 --> 00:15:20.141
(tense music)

187
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.357
- Come on. you can do this.

188
00:16:44.357 --> 00:16:45.536
You can do this.

189
00:16:45.536 --> 00:16:48.270
- [Brian] Are you sure about this?

190
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.883
- Yes. I'm sure.

191
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.193
I have plenty of options.

192
00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.520
With my credentials. there's
gonna be a local clinic

193
00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.653
or a hospital that can use my experience.

194
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:02.880
Besides. most of these doctors

195
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.369
that are fresh out of medical school.

196
00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.050
they can't really help
people that need help.

197
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.980
- Yeah. you're right about that.

198
00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.613
But I don't know. I just.

199
00:17:13.522 --> 00:17:15.270
I don't wanna be that guy

200
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.343
whose wife leaves everything for.

201
00:17:19.443 --> 00:17:23.569
And I don't know. maybe 10. 20 years later

202
00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.653
she resents him and kills him in the bed.

203
00:17:29.297 --> 00:17:30.260
(laughing)

204
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.930
- Wait. wait. whoah.

205
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.360
Baby. hold up. hang on.

206
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.960
You think I'm going to
murder you in our bed

207
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.810
in 20 years time?

208
00:17:41.171 --> 00:17:43.123
That's so cute. baby.

209
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.620
What do you think of me?

210
00:17:48.964 --> 00:17:51.323
You know I can think of
a thousand ways to kill.

211
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:53.770
But bed. ugh.

212
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.680
It isn't one of them.

213
00:18:00.543 --> 00:18:03.043
(tense music)

214
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.000
There's plenty of other
methods of homicide.

215
00:18:15.525 --> 00:18:16.675
- How many do you know?

216
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.650
- Well I could poison you.

217
00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:22.059
I could slip you a drug

218
00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:23.260
that would slowly and cleanly

219
00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.047
tear you apart from the inside.

220
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.420
leaving no mess at all.

221
00:18:38.927 --> 00:18:41.533
I'm joking. baby. (laughing)

222
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.683
Oh. come on.

223
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.260
You just have to know I
was an army psychologist

224
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.580
for so many years.

225
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.893
and yeah I've heard a lot of stories.

226
00:18:58.246 --> 00:18:59.746
- I know you have.

227
00:19:02.348 --> 00:19:04.390
- Well I wanna get out of it.

228
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:05.923
Open up my own practice.

229
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.680
I actually wanna help abused women.

230
00:19:10.658 --> 00:19:12.320
When I'm more stable.

231
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.843
when we are more stable.

232
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.460
- Yeah. I get that. but.

233
00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.210
I mean if you leave how do you know

234
00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:23.640
if you're gonna be stable.

235
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.483
if we are gonna be stable?

236
00:19:26.483 --> 00:19:28.233
You know. you never know.

237
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.190
I mean are you're really sure?

238
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.553
- Yeah.

239
00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:37.443
Yes. I'm sure.

240
00:19:38.522 --> 00:19:39.355
- Okay.

241
00:19:41.619 --> 00:19:42.452
Okay.

242
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.373
- Yes. I am so sure.

243
00:19:47.984 --> 00:19:51.513
(Brian chuckling)

244
00:19:51.513 --> 00:19:52.513
I am so sure.

245
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.720
What did you learn at Camp McCall?

246
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.240
SEER.

247
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.673
Survival. Evasion. Resistance.

248
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:09.403
Escape.

249
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.260
The first moments are the most critical.

250
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.860
Try to escape before you become.

251
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.133
captured.

252
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.040
Once you become captured. your
chances of escape go down.

253
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.560
Your situation becomes
much more difficult.

254
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.170
You lose tenacity and fear takes over.

255
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.873
A weapon. you need a weapon.

256
00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.820
Your mind. Tara.

257
00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:35.920
Your mind is a weapon.

258
00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:39.410
All those sessions with soldiers with PTSD

259
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.070
went way over the edge.

260
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.323
No other psychologist would
take them. but you did.

261
00:20:44.323 --> 00:20:46.740
And did any of them ever harm you. no.

262
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.050
Because you used your head.

263
00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.513
You controlled the situation.

264
00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.590
The man who delivered the box.

265
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.590
You've seen him somewhere before. where?

266
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.000
Was he in the army?

267
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.550
Was he one of Brian's patients?

268
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.920
Did you run into him at the surplus store?

269
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.033
Think. Tara.

270
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.090
The man who delivered the box.

271
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.140
he's your first clue.

272
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.794
Don't give up.

273
00:21:18.794 --> 00:21:20.297
Focus on something you can do.

274
00:21:24.822 --> 00:21:26.572
Radio. get the radio.

275
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.003
Ah. fuck.

276
00:21:32.932 --> 00:21:36.099
(lightly tense music)

277
00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:46.810
It's doubtful it would
be someone from the army.

278
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.260
you'd been out almost two years.

279
00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.690
Next question. why.

280
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.820
Why would someone take you?

281
00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.523
Use your training. Tara. think.

282
00:21:55.007 --> 00:21:56.403
Why do people get kidnapped?

283
00:21:57.299 --> 00:22:00.451
Think. think!

284
00:22:00.451 --> 00:22:01.701
People get kidnapped for.

285
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.140
money?

286
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:04.973
Revenge?

287
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.330
Mental disorder like Norman from Psycho.

288
00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.220
Physical torture and...

289
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.933
sex.

290
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.620
Women get kidnapped for sex.

291
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.273
for sex trafficking and
to become sex slaves.

292
00:22:26.304 --> 00:22:28.940
Money. why wouldn't they take someone

293
00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.180
with a more substantial income?

294
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.440
All of our money is going to student loans

295
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.930
and now the house.

296
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:34.960
and currency's going digital.

297
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.773
there's no way he'd get away with it.

298
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.770
You led a decent life.

299
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.990
You never intentionally
tried to harm anyone.

300
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.020
And you drive like an old lady

301
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.993
so road rage is out. revenge is out.

302
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.710
Wait now.

303
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.159
What about Brian's ex-girlfriend?

304
00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:55.477
Oh no.

305
00:22:55.477 --> 00:22:57.277
She's planning my bridal shower now.

306
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.630
This was too well planned out.

307
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.763
Mental disorder.

308
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.443
Even the craziest soldiers.
you treated them well.

309
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.910
And whoever did it has some
kind of medical background

310
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.210
because he knocked me out with something.

311
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.163
Physical torture.

312
00:23:25.092 --> 00:23:26.010
No.

313
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.842
No. he left me food and water.

314
00:23:27.842 --> 00:23:28.700
If he wanted to torture me

315
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.690
he'd make me beg for food and water.

316
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.180
Sex traffickers generally take women

317
00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.180
who won't be missed.

318
00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.513
And Brian will notice. Julie will notice.

319
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.050
But it has to be either torture or sex

320
00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.210
and neither of those is an option.

321
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.043
Torture.

322
00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.920
He'd beat me first.

323
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.080
He'd show me that he is the master

324
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.030
and I am the slave.

325
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.692
But both torture and sex.

326
00:23:53.692 --> 00:23:55.120
they drug the victim first.

327
00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.320
No.

328
00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.560
You had to twist open the bottle

329
00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.010
and the packages were sealed.

330
00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.603
Okay. okay.

331
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.143
Sex. it has to be sex.

332
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.376
But why haven't they gang raped me yet?

333
00:24:13.376 --> 00:24:14.670
It's the first step.

334
00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.503
Second step.

335
00:24:15.503 --> 00:24:17.550
First step is they drug the victim first.

336
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.480
But trafficking organizations
have a top age of 25

337
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.260
and I'm...

338
00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.530
Evasion.

339
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.770
Your captors will deliberately
try to disorient you.

340
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.340
Think. Tara. think.

341
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.903
What do you recall before waking up here?

342
00:24:36.988 --> 00:24:37.821
Think!

343
00:24:39.532 --> 00:24:41.412
I don't know.

344
00:24:41.412 --> 00:24:42.495
I don't know.

345
00:24:43.873 --> 00:24:44.706
Not real.

346
00:24:56.885 --> 00:24:59.385
I don't recall waking up here.

347
00:25:00.478 --> 00:25:03.159
(screaming)

348
00:25:03.159 --> 00:25:04.486
Help!

349
00:25:04.486 --> 00:25:06.100
What are you doing. be quiet.

350
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.783
Do you want to get yourself killed?

351
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.423
Listen.

352
00:25:15.816 --> 00:25:18.566
(birds chirping)

353
00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:27.089
I don't hear anything.

354
00:25:34.246 --> 00:25:35.079
Birds.

355
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.193
Birds!

356
00:25:40.486 --> 00:25:42.319
I'm outside somewhere.

357
00:25:44.667 --> 00:25:45.867
Outside somewhere where.

358
00:25:47.141 --> 00:25:48.724
where no one can...

359
00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:54.388
(sobbing)

360
00:25:58.008 --> 00:26:00.211
Why is this happening?

361
00:26:00.211 --> 00:26:03.628
I don't know why this is happening to me.

362
00:26:04.678 --> 00:26:06.750
I don't deserve this.

363
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.290
Article V of the US Military
Code of Conduct states

364
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.950
if your questioned should
you become a prisoner of war.

365
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:14.960
you're required to give your name. rank.

366
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.660
service number. and date of birth.

367
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.670
You will evade answering
any further questions

368
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.170
to the utmost of your ability.

369
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.410
If your captors want
information. play dumb.

370
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.730
You're just a lowly private
who doesn't know anything.

371
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.460
If you're higher ranking.
tell them that your aides

372
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.750
work out all the battle plans for you

373
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.210
and you don't know them yourself.

374
00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:35.960
Hell. tell them you just make
the coffee in the office.

375
00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:41.860
(sobbing)

376
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.750
But above everything else. keep the faith.

377
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.920
You will escape of you will get rescued.

378
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.958
I don't understand.

379
00:26:47.958 --> 00:26:49.220
But you will survive

380
00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.683
and you will return home with honor.

381
00:26:54.602 --> 00:26:57.269
(door clanking)

382
00:27:02.531 --> 00:27:05.198
(door slamming)

383
00:27:06.506 --> 00:27:07.923
What do you want?

384
00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:13.547
Please tell me what you want.

385
00:27:13.547 --> 00:27:14.380
Please.

386
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.713
- Do you know what "de opresso
liber" means. Cassandra?

387
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.050
- My name isn't Cassandra.

388
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.110
You've got the wrong person.

389
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.310
you're making a mistake.

390
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.500
- What's in a name anyway?

391
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.463
Today. right now.

392
00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.003
At this very moment.

393
00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.003
your name is Cassandra.

394
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.503
My name is Bruce.

395
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.583
Now.

396
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.533
Say your name.

397
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.390
Say your name.

398
00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.223
- Cassandra.

399
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:23.803
- Good.

400
00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.750
Have a pleasant night. Cassandra.

401
00:28:33.106 --> 00:28:35.170
(tense music)

402
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.113
- Wait. Bruce.

403
00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.283
Bruce.

404
00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:41.540
What do you want?

405
00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:47.400
I don't have any money.

406
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.950
Have I hurt you. do I know you?

407
00:28:52.011 --> 00:28:53.030
I don't know any Cassandras.

408
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.313
you're making a mistake.

409
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.340
Please. just let me go.

410
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.373
Just let me go. Bruce. please.

411
00:29:02.896 --> 00:29:04.602
- You will tell no one?

412
00:29:04.602 --> 00:29:06.602
- [Tara] No one. no one. I swear to God.

413
00:29:08.008 --> 00:29:08.841
I swear.

414
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.687
- Soon.

415
00:29:13.687 --> 00:29:15.143
But not yet. Cassandra.

416
00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.170
All in good time.

417
00:29:18.703 --> 00:29:19.553
All in good time.

418
00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:23.763
- Bruce. Bruce!

419
00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.100
Wait. no. no!

420
00:29:27.417 --> 00:29:30.084
(door slamming)

421
00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.477
Why am I here?

422
00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.450
- We're here to help people.

423
00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.930
- Sometimes I wonder whether I'm helping

424
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:49.793
anyone at all.

425
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.740
- Captain. you couldn't have known.

426
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.573
- No. I should have known.

427
00:29:53.573 --> 00:29:56.730
He was my patient. I was
treating him. I was...

428
00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.883
- You said it before. Captain.

429
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.483
We can't save everyone.

430
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:04.823
- But Eddie. I.

431
00:30:05.915 --> 00:30:07.150
Eddie. I could have saved him!

432
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.143
- These soldiers are mentally unsound.

433
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:11.287
- No. it's my fault.

434
00:30:11.287 --> 00:30:12.511
There was something I missed.

435
00:30:12.511 --> 00:30:13.760
There was something...

436
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.100
There was something I missed.

437
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.973
- They undergo extensive training.

438
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.650
They're deprived of rest and food

439
00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:22.713
for weeks on end.

440
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.120
Now he probably knew exactly

441
00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.473
what you wanted to hear.

442
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.583
And Captain. he wanted to go back.

443
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.483
And that is not your fault.

444
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.173
- Colonel. sir. it is my fault.

445
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.543
It's my job.

446
00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.400
I should have seen through his act.

447
00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.860
I should have confirmed my suspicions

448
00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.980
on his diagnosis way before
any of this happened.

449
00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.640
I could have closed the gate on this.

450
00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.790
He killed a whole team
of Afghan nationals.

451
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.750
And they never saw it coming.

452
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.350
They weren't there for the A-team.

453
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.773
You and I both know that.

454
00:31:17.114 --> 00:31:18.510
They took it way beyond self-defense.

455
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:20.060
It was way beyond self-defense.

456
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.310
It was walking around with
their bloody intestines

457
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.791
all over his shoulders

458
00:31:25.791 --> 00:31:26.680
and he was going to each-

459
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.513
- Captain!

460
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:29.973
Don't.

461
00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:32.923
Please don't.

462
00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.630
- Bruce said "de opresso liber".

463
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:41.953
To free the opressed.

464
00:31:43.758 --> 00:31:45.680
Bruce was a green beret.

465
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.657
Or PSYOPs. he might be
doing this because of Eddie.

466
00:31:48.657 --> 00:31:49.490
But why?

467
00:31:51.037 --> 00:31:52.497
There's nothing to be gained.

468
00:31:55.217 --> 00:31:57.717
(tense music)

469
00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.750
I can't tell the army Eddie's okay.

470
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.250
it's too late for that.

471
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.870
- [Eddie] Why?

472
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.220
- Because it will help you.

473
00:32:08.099 --> 00:32:09.449
- The mission's classified.

474
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.770
- Yes. of course. Eddie. but

475
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.450
I do have the necessary
clearance for this and

476
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.650
everything we talk about
remains classified.

477
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.700
Look. you don't have to tell me anything

478
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.670
you don't wanna talk about.

479
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:29.593
Just tell me about how you're feeling.

480
00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:32.100
what you're thinking.

481
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.883
so we can sort through this together.

482
00:32:34.883 --> 00:32:35.716
- We.

483
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.020
I like the way you just did that.

484
00:32:40.733 --> 00:32:42.400
- And what was that?

485
00:32:43.567 --> 00:32:47.236
- The way you took my problem

486
00:32:47.236 --> 00:32:48.773
and made it about us.

487
00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:50.853
You're good.

488
00:32:52.456 --> 00:32:55.813
But you're gonna somehow keep my demons

489
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:58.023
locked in the closet?

490
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.316
- You have to trust me. Eddie.

491
00:33:03.316 --> 00:33:04.980
I'm really here to help you.

492
00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.813
- Trust?

493
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:08.560
That's a good one. Doc.

494
00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:14.170
You know. that's exactly what
we would say to the natives

495
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:18.850
whenever we would stroll
up in their village

496
00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.830
wanting them to put
their lives in the line

497
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.283
to fight our war.

498
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:25.293
Trust us.

499
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:28.093
Trust us.

500
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.443
We are here to help.

501
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:35.910
You know like I know that's
nothing but bullshit.

502
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.293
We train them to fight.

503
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.833
Then when the president says it's enough.

504
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.023
we get to go home to America.

505
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:50.000
While those natives have
to watch their daughters

506
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.690
get raped and slaughtered
like fucking pigs.

507
00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.180
- Eddie. you were doing your job.

508
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:02.000
You cannot believe that those people

509
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.762
were your responsibility.

510
00:34:03.762 --> 00:34:06.663
- (laughing) Yeah. okay.

511
00:34:08.495 --> 00:34:10.280
- Look. if it was really that bad

512
00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:12.723
why do you wanna go back?

513
00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:16.513
- Now there's a good question. good girl.

514
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:22.672
Because.

515
00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.803
it's the only thing I know how to do.

516
00:34:27.545 --> 00:34:29.770
And I'm very. very good at it.

517
00:34:32.746 --> 00:34:33.580
- Okay. Eddie.

518
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.090
Why don't you tell me a little bit of

519
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:39.139
how you came to be on the Special Forces?

520
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.710
Tell me a little bit
about your family life.

521
00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.570
Did you have any brothers and sisters?

522
00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.320
What did your father do for a living?

523
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.719
Tell me a little bit about your mother.

524
00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.480
Let me get to know you a little bit.

525
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.043
- We're gonna do this?

526
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.643
Four professions that I truly despise.

527
00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.283
You wanna hear 'em?

528
00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.150
- [Tara] Yeah.

529
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.470
- Okay.

530
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.480
One. attorneys.

531
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.467
Fucking hate 'em.

532
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.863
Two. doctors.

533
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.933
Three. good old car salesmen.

534
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:33.133
And four. my favorite of
the bunch. psychologists.

535
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:40.833
Because y'all think that
you know more than me.

536
00:35:42.727 --> 00:35:47.727
And you believe in that
warped fucking mind

537
00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:50.733
that I need your help.

538
00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:52.953
I don't.

539
00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.373
- Eddie. I'm here to help you.

540
00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.463
- You read my file.

541
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.280
You know that I was orphaned
at the age of seven.

542
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.613
You know that I graduated
from high school with honors.

543
00:36:07.476 --> 00:36:11.333
You know that I got a
Bachelor's Degree in Education.

544
00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.900
And you also know that after three years

545
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.750
I joined the army.

546
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.660
And then after that. after two.

547
00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.453
I was selected for green berets.

548
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.830
You know everything about me.

549
00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.088
But you wanna sit there.

550
00:36:27.088 --> 00:36:29.020
look me in my eyes

551
00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.240
and play these little
fucking mind games with me

552
00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.360
about how I'm feeling.

553
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.450
And whether the fact that
my father was a minister

554
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.913
is causing me to doubt what I'm doing.

555
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:45.803
- [Tara] Your fath-

556
00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:47.970
(hands slamming)
- My father.

557
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:49.063
was a mechanic.

558
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.607
But you already knew that.

559
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:58.743
Doc.

560
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.110
I'm tired of killing.

561
00:37:04.707 --> 00:37:06.120
But it's all I know.

562
00:37:08.685 --> 00:37:10.018
It's all I know.

563
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.550
- Eddie. I have read your file.

564
00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.070
And I also know that you and your team

565
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.333
rescued many. many hostages.

566
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.653
You might have taken lives.

567
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.133
but you saved many. many more.

568
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.410
Lives that would have been lost

569
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:32.893
had you not been there.

570
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.310
You've done a lot of good.

571
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.880
- We have a motto in the Special Forces.

572
00:37:46.407 --> 00:37:47.997
"De opresso libre".

573
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:50.963
To free the opressed.

574
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.157
You think about that.

575
00:37:54.157 --> 00:37:56.303
- It has to be related to Eddie. but why?

576
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.770
The families of the soldiers?

577
00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.540
Do they want revenge?

578
00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.410
Eddie was also a part

579
00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:10.333
of the Apsychological Operations Unit.

580
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.770
They were responsible for
using nonviolent means

581
00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.570
to persuade enemy and neutral nations

582
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.140
to take actions that the
US Government wanted.

583
00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.640
This is because of Eddie then.

584
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.130
Do they want me to talk?

585
00:38:27.644 --> 00:38:28.477
Is this a trick?

586
00:38:33.883 --> 00:38:34.716
If this isn't about Eddie and I.

587
00:38:34.716 --> 00:38:35.923
don't use the radio then.

588
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.970
They'll torture. rape and kill me.

589
00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:46.870
Is it worth the risk?

590
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:47.703
No. not yet.

591
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.810
Brian will call the police.

592
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:53.210
They'll interview the neighbors.

593
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.610
Mrs. Olson. the busybody.
she's always watching.

594
00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.932
She will tell them that you got kidnapped.

595
00:38:58.932 --> 00:39:01.240
She'll give them the license plate number.

596
00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.550
The police will track the
vehicle to this location.

597
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.500
They will find you.

598
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.810
Just keep the faith. Tara.

599
00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:08.973
Keep the faith.

600
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.400
Yeah.

601
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.050
Yeah. yeah Brian's gonna find me.

602
00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.100
I know it. I know it. he's gonna find me.

603
00:39:19.996 --> 00:39:22.496
(tense music)

604
00:39:32.735 --> 00:39:35.818
(eerie techno music)

605
00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.653
- [Brian] She's not at the house.

606
00:39:44.653 --> 00:39:46.500
Do you know where she is?

607
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.300
- [Julie] You didn't get her text?

608
00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.340
- No. no.

609
00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.740
Well. no.

610
00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.040
- [Julie] She said that
she decided to talk

611
00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.690
to her former Colonel to
see about getting referrals.

612
00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:00.350
- [Brian] Colonel Reeder
in North Carolina?

613
00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:01.707
- [Julie] Yes. at Fort Bragg?

614
00:40:01.707 --> 00:40:03.890
- But we were supposed to
see the venues this week.

615
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:06.477
- [Julie] She said that she'd
be gone at least three days.

616
00:40:06.477 --> 00:40:08.790
- But why would she go
to Fort Bragg. I mean?

617
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:09.920
- [Julie] Clients.

618
00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.240
The Colonel said he'd work up a list

619
00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.820
of current and former military wives

620
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.063
who might be interested
in counseling sessions.

621
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:17.650
- Okay. um...

622
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.580
- [Julie] I shouldn't tell you

623
00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.100
but she was hoping this would be something

624
00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.150
of a wedding present.

625
00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:23.570
She knows you spent a lot.

626
00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.540
and she loves you more than anything.

627
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.853
you have to know that.

628
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:32.093
By the way. put the cards
in the refrigerator.

629
00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:37.290
- All right. yeah. cool.

630
00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:39.333
All right Julie. I'll talk to you later.

631
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.563
Thanks. bye.

632
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.750
Put the cards in the refrigerator?

633
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:52.150
- It shouldn't be this cold.

634
00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:57.510
Don't be stupid. he's
using sensory torture.

635
00:40:58.908 --> 00:41:00.290
And what makes you think he didn't plant

636
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:02.180
the radio there for you to use?

637
00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.280
To get you to talk. to spill your secrets!

638
00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.740
The radio was over there. it was hiding.

639
00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.790
He probably didn't even know it was here.

640
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:16.630
He chained you to the RV floor.

641
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:18.430
of course he would have searched it.

642
00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.140
Well if he thought this
was a temporary place.

643
00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:22.973
maybe he didn't know.

644
00:41:22.973 --> 00:41:24.553
Maybe he didn't know it was here.

645
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:33.000
But if I don't use the
radio and he comes back...

646
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.050
Don't think about what could happen.

647
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:40.103
Think about escape.

648
00:41:47.812 --> 00:41:49.320
It's worth the risk.

649
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:50.420
It's your only chance.

650
00:42:33.115 --> 00:42:35.365
(scraping)

651
00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:38.693
Hello?

652
00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.110
Hello. is there anyone there?

653
00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:49.993
Hello. hello. is there anyone there?

654
00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.400
Someone please an...

655
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:56.020
Someone please answer me.

656
00:42:58.450 --> 00:42:59.860
Hello?

657
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.439
Hello. please. someone.

658
00:43:01.439 --> 00:43:02.939
This is so stupid.

659
00:43:05.174 --> 00:43:07.091
- [Man] Yeah. I'm here.

660
00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.370
- Hi. hi.

661
00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:12.203
I need help.

662
00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.133
- [Man] Yeah. well don't we all?

663
00:43:16.784 --> 00:43:18.130
- No. I'm serious.

664
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:19.130
I've been kidnapped.

665
00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:22.753
- [Man] Yeah sure. tell me another one.

666
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.550
- I'm being serious.

667
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:27.070
Somebody took me out of my apartment

668
00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.044
and put me in an RV.

669
00:43:29.044 --> 00:43:31.340
- [Man] Oh. I get it.

670
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.180
You and your girlfriends are
taking a little road trip

671
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.133
in an RV. huh?

672
00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.410
Well. radio's not a thing
to play around with.

673
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.560
Like. you teasing the guys. huh.

674
00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:41.580
so get the hell off the air

675
00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.190
and go tell your girlfriends that-

676
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:46.040
- I'm being fucking
serious. I got kidnapped!

677
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.390
- [Man] Then call the cops!

678
00:43:49.082 --> 00:43:50.879
- I don't have a phone.

679
00:43:50.879 --> 00:43:51.712
- [Man] You don't have a phone.

680
00:43:51.712 --> 00:43:53.423
my five year old niece has a phone!

681
00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:00.450
- I have a phone but it's in my apartment.

682
00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:02.303
Would you please call the cops?

683
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.340
- [Man] Sure. sure. yeah. yeah.

684
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.770
Let's start with the basics. okay?

685
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:08.420
What's your name?

686
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.793
- Tara. Tara Mays.

687
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.890
- [Man] I'm Kenny.

688
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:13.190
But you can call me Kenny

689
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.610
but I'd prefer Bullet.

690
00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:17.190
- Okay. thank you. Kenny.

691
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.553
Bullet. thank you. Bullet.

692
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.600
- [Kenny] Where are you?

693
00:44:22.151 --> 00:44:23.675
- I'm inside of an RV.

694
00:44:23.675 --> 00:44:26.020
- [Kenny] Yeah. (laughing) you said that.

695
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.060
but where the fuck is the RV?

696
00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:28.893
- I don't know.

697
00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:31.760
- [Kenny] Wait a minute.

698
00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.800
You want me to call the cops

699
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.390
and tell them that you've been kidnapped

700
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:36.940
but I don't know where you are?

701
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.490
How the hell are they gonna find you?

702
00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:42.210
No. no. no. no. see. this is how it works.

703
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.240
I call the cops. they'll make a record.

704
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.180
put my name on file.

705
00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.210
Then when they can't find you

706
00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.630
they'll put a note in my electronic file

707
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.550
saying that I'm a crank caller.

708
00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:54.110
And then when I really
need the cops and call 'em.

709
00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.710
these guys are gonna laugh
at me and just. you know?

710
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.040
- The police are gonna
interview my neighbors.

711
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:05.780
Talk to Mrs. Olson. she
would have seen something.

712
00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.080
- [Kenny] How old are you?

713
00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.750
- I don't see how that fucking matters!

714
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.030
- [Kenny] Are you over 18?

715
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.760
Then the cops are gonna say
you had a right to disappear.

716
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.420
They don't find any sign of
a crime at your apartment.

717
00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:18.420
they'll just blow it off.

718
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.593
but you know. they'll know my name.

719
00:45:25.487 --> 00:45:27.470
- Then don't give 'em your name.

720
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:28.930
Please. don't give them your name

721
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:30.903
but call the fucking cops now!

722
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:40.153
Hello?

723
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.363
Bullet. hello?

724
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:47.810
Bullet. are you still there?

725
00:45:49.683 --> 00:45:50.516
Oh god.

726
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.837
You did it again. Tara.

727
00:45:56.712 --> 00:45:58.795
When will you ever learn?

728
00:46:13.121 --> 00:46:15.871
(radio clacking)

729
00:46:27.916 --> 00:46:29.690
Roger. I completely
understand what you're saying.

730
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:33.193
- Ah. fuck you too. (laughing)

731
00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.493
Sorry.

732
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:43.012
- We've both been in the same uniform and-

733
00:46:43.012 --> 00:46:44.617
- Yeah?

734
00:46:44.617 --> 00:46:46.770
But have you ever gotten
blood on your uniforms?

735
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:47.603
No.

736
00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:54.173
Maybe a little of that sweet
sweat that runs down your back.

737
00:46:58.025 --> 00:47:00.550
(tense music)

738
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:02.063
Ever killed anyone. Doc?

739
00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.470
- Roger. there's many
people in the military

740
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.190
who perform invaluable duties. and

741
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:16.690
all of these which-
(Roger laughing)

742
00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:20.167
- You've never even thought
about killing someone. have you?

743
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.160
(gasping) No.

744
00:47:30.443 --> 00:47:31.276
- Okay Roger. we're here to talk about-

745
00:47:31.276 --> 00:47:33.150
- Yeah I know. we're
here to talk about me.

746
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:34.240
I know. not what you think you've done

747
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.860
or what you think you're capable of doing.

748
00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:36.710
I know. I get it.

749
00:47:37.958 --> 00:47:40.370
(sighing) So long as you
people have me locked up

750
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.730
in this godforsaken building.

751
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.530
rotting and waiting for what?

752
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:48.513
Yes. I kill people.
civilians. yes. I get it.

753
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.070
Right. isn't that why we're here?

754
00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:55.600
- [Tara] Well yes. but I'm here-

755
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.580
- I killed those kids

756
00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.540
because God only knows which
one of those little bastards

757
00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:00.673
was gonna be a plant.

758
00:48:02.892 --> 00:48:05.020
Had I not killed those kids.

759
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.366
and they'd gone on to kill the target.

760
00:48:07.366 --> 00:48:09.133
my men could have died.

761
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:11.583
Get it?

762
00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:14.733
- Okay Roger. I think we're gonna-

763
00:48:14.733 --> 00:48:16.213
- And I will do it again.

764
00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.813
Isn't that what you really wanna know?

765
00:48:26.398 --> 00:48:29.148
(gasping) Oh no.

766
00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.113
You wanna know if I have nightmares.

767
00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:36.533
Right?

768
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:39.453
And that if I'd do it again.

769
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:43.210
Nightmares about putting
rounds to the heads

770
00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.623
of 10 year old kids.

771
00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.343
And if I would do it again.

772
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.720
Yeah Doc. I would.

773
00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.430
And no. I don't have nightmares.

774
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:56.240
I did what I had to do.

775
00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.253
I did what I was trained to do!

776
00:49:03.769 --> 00:49:08.769
You don't know shit. (scoffing)

777
00:49:14.053 --> 00:49:15.153
- I do know something.

778
00:49:18.313 --> 00:49:19.410
And I know we're not really here

779
00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:21.300
because you protected your team.

780
00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.890
We are here because of the allegations

781
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:23.723
of your sexual-

782
00:49:23.723 --> 00:49:26.400
- You better watch your
fucking mouth. bitch!

783
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.087
I could kill you right fucking now

784
00:49:28.087 --> 00:49:30.173
and there's nothing you
could do to stop me.

785
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:34.167
You. you don't know me.

786
00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.663
- Roger please. I need you to calm down.

787
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:40.027
Things are gonna go a lot easier on you

788
00:49:40.027 --> 00:49:41.283
if you do what I say.

789
00:49:44.643 --> 00:49:48.000
(music intensifying)

790
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:48.903
- You killed me.

791
00:49:50.416 --> 00:49:51.660
(Tara gasping)

792
00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:52.813
You killed me!

793
00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.397
- (whimpering) No.

794
00:50:01.527 --> 00:50:03.338
That was not my fault.

795
00:50:03.338 --> 00:50:04.570
- Of course it's not my fault.

796
00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:06.540
From what you told me about Roger.

797
00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.840
he's a real piece of work.

798
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:11.703
Psychopath. sociopath.

799
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.360
(sighing) It's not your fault.

800
00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.000
If it was anybody's fault.

801
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.450
it's the guards for having
not searched his cell.

802
00:50:23.996 --> 00:50:27.620
- Roger hung himself
in his room yesterday.

803
00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:31.853
And I didn't put him on suicide watch.

804
00:50:33.269 --> 00:50:34.610
I didn't think he was self-destructive.

805
00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.484
I didn't think he was gonna...

806
00:50:36.484 --> 00:50:37.540
(somber piano music)

807
00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:39.980
- You're given a certain amount of time

808
00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:44.073
to get to know and come
to your conclusion.

809
00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:47.020
But that's not your fault.

810
00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:50.120
Maybe if you had more time
or fewer cases. but...

811
00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.140
- No. I had enough time.

812
00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:56.283
But my conclusion was wrong.

813
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:02.779
It's my fault that he's dead.

814
00:51:02.779 --> 00:51:04.240
I should have known.

815
00:51:12.218 --> 00:51:13.140
If Brian finds out.

816
00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.903
he's never gonna trust me again.

817
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.800
He's always been so
skeptical about my work.

818
00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.740
And now this is...

819
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:33.850
He doesn't think I'm
cut out to handle people

820
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:34.810
when I'm so...

821
00:51:39.304 --> 00:51:41.554
When I'm so fragile myself.

822
00:51:58.334 --> 00:52:01.917
- [Brian] Tara. baby.
dinner's about ready!

823
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:09.743
- [Man] Baby. come away with me.

824
00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.730
Leave that nutcase.

825
00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:14.090
You can get out.

826
00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:16.133
I can get my pension ready instead.

827
00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:19.743
You and me. we'll live
off the grid together.

828
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:29.880
- Brian. that's not what you think.

829
00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:41.154
- Hey. what's happening?

830
00:52:41.154 --> 00:52:41.987
No. no!

831
00:52:44.693 --> 00:52:49.693
No! (sobbing)

832
00:52:49.693 --> 00:52:50.526
No. no!

833
00:52:52.548 --> 00:52:54.452
(somber music)

834
00:52:54.452 --> 00:52:58.136
I don't wanna live. I don't wanna live!

835
00:52:58.136 --> 00:53:02.336
No! (sobbing)

836
00:53:04.217 --> 00:53:06.815
- [Brian] Lay back. baby.
lay back baby. lay back.

837
00:53:06.815 --> 00:53:09.018
Lay back. baby. lay back.

838
00:53:09.018 --> 00:53:11.268
(thumping)

839
00:53:25.193 --> 00:53:28.340
(floor creaking)

840
00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:29.223
- It's not real.

841
00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:31.730
You're just examining your life.

842
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:34.910
The bad things.

843
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:36.960
- [Kenny] You have no idea where you are?

844
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.593
- No.

845
00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:44.603
I don't know.

846
00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.180
- [Kenny] Right. anything in that RV

847
00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:48.543
to show who owns it?

848
00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.350
Maybe the photograph. name. registration.

849
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:54.220
something personal. something I can run

850
00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.270
through the internet.

851
00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:04.753
- I know I'm in a field. a remote field.

852
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:10.030
- [Kenny] Oh. sure. little miss militia.

853
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:11.020
That narrows it right down.

854
00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:12.570
I'll call the NSA right now

855
00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:14.810
and have them pull up all
of their satellite photos

856
00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:15.850
for empty fields.

857
00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:17.537
Or why don't you just send
up a flare or something?

858
00:54:17.537 --> 00:54:19.960
- Look. I'm trying. okay?

859
00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:20.793
I'm trying.

860
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:26.820
- [Kenny] Okay. okay. look.

861
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:28.230
Search around.

862
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:30.230
See if you can find
something in the RV. okay?

863
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:31.370
I'm gonna call some buddies

864
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:34.290
and see if they know anything.

865
00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:35.740
I'll talk to you later.

866
00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:36.843
- Wait.

867
00:54:36.843 --> 00:54:37.676
Bullet.

868
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.180
Bullet. are you still there?

869
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.513
Okay.

870
00:54:54.723 --> 00:54:55.556
Okay.

871
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.233
Look around.

872
00:55:00.905 --> 00:55:04.572
(lightly suspenseful music)

873
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.902
Okay.

874
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:15.213
Timothy Harrison.

875
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.410
Laura Kennington.

876
00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:39.836
Phone number.

877
00:55:39.836 --> 00:55:41.919
- [Kenny] You on the air?

878
00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:46.223
- Bullet. yeah. yeah. I'm here.

879
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:49.340
- [Kenny] Okay. so here's the deal.

880
00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.313
No one has reported you missing.

881
00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.293
- What?

882
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.010
What about Brian?

883
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.790
It hasn't been on the news. nothing?

884
00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:01.623
Nothing?

885
00:56:01.623 --> 00:56:03.470
- [Kenny] Oh jeez Louise.
don't get your panties

886
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:05.140
in a knot. huh?

887
00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.800
More hostages get themselves killed

888
00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:07.900
when their captors figure out

889
00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.370
that someone has reported them missing.

890
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:13.860
Count yourself lucky that no
one has reported you missing.

891
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:16.113
All right. now. did
you do like I told you?

892
00:56:17.131 --> 00:56:19.290
Did you search the place. find some names.

893
00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:21.687
something I can track down. anything?

894
00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:26.150
- Yeah. yeah. I have names.

895
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:28.333
Timothy Harrison and Laura Kennington.

896
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.983
- [Kenny] What kind of
fucked up name is Kennington?

897
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:34.110
- I don't know. British?

898
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.762
And I have a phone number.

899
00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:43.173
208-558-4848.

900
00:56:44.431 --> 00:56:47.120
- [Kenny] Hmm. well
that's not a local number.

901
00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.480
I'll check the area code.

902
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.260
- I have a street address.

903
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.423
6155 North Main Street.

904
00:56:54.617 --> 00:56:57.558
- [Kenny] You feel like
sharing the city with me?

905
00:56:57.558 --> 00:56:58.640
- It doesn't have a city.

906
00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.750
But it came with the phone number

907
00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:02.243
so it should be whatever area code 208 is.

908
00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:05.333
- [Kenny] Wow. hey. you're sharp.

909
00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:07.253
What else?

910
00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:12.160
- E. Jennings.

911
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.542
- [Kenny] Wow.

912
00:57:13.542 --> 00:57:16.190
Now I wonder how many
E. Jennings there are.

913
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:17.023
Anything else?

914
00:57:19.362 --> 00:57:20.520
- No. I stopped searching.

915
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.263
I couldn't find anything.

916
00:57:25.037 --> 00:57:28.223
- At this very moment.
your name is Cassandra.

917
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.823
My name is Bruce.

918
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:37.170
- Wait.

919
00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:38.728
Wait. he said his name was Bruce

920
00:57:38.728 --> 00:57:39.960
and that mine was Cassandra.

921
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.570
- [Kenny] Why the fuck
didn't you tell me that

922
00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:42.440
to begin with?

923
00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:43.490
- I don't know. I don't know.

924
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:45.140
I just thought of that right now.

925
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:47.853
Hey. you know what?

926
00:57:47.853 --> 00:57:49.340
Why don't you try getting kidnapped

927
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:52.370
and having a chain on
your ankle. and. and...

928
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:53.820
- [Kenny] What kind of chain?

929
00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:56.640
It's important.

930
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:59.420
Everything you see. everything Bruce says.

931
00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.140
it's all important.

932
00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.920
Now what kind of chain?

933
00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.290
Big links. small links?

934
00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:06.350
And what kind of lock?

935
00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:07.923
Combination or key?

936
00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:10.830
- I don't know. it's a normal chain.

937
00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:13.000
it's small links.

938
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.590
It's heavy.

939
00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:19.150
And a key lock. an old key lock.

940
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:20.603
Like it's been used a lot.

941
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.300
He's had a lot of victims.

942
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:28.700
- [Kenny] Okay. okay. I'll
run over what you gave me.

943
00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.813
Just stay strong. I'll find ya.

944
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:38.363
- Thank you so much. Bullet.

945
00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:41.770
I don't know what I would do

946
00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:43.777
if I wasn't talking to you right now.

947
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.320
- [Kenny] Listen. give me a few hours.

948
00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:02.670
- Don't push him.

949
00:59:04.475 --> 00:59:06.142
He's your only hope.

950
00:59:13.072 --> 00:59:14.739
He's your only hope.

951
00:59:25.075 --> 00:59:28.102
(clattering)

952
00:59:28.102 --> 00:59:30.269
(buzzing)

953
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:32.923
You have to trust me.

954
00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.703
- I didn't do it.

955
00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.540
- They have the other boot.

956
00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:43.040
I found this one in your room.

957
00:59:45.837 --> 00:59:47.254
- I didn't do it.

958
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:51.730
- George. the wear pattern on this boot

959
00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:53.643
matches the one they have in evidence.

960
00:59:57.454 --> 00:59:58.553
- I didn't do it!

961
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:03.880
- George. I'm trying to help you.

962
01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:05.873
Before any of this happened.

963
01:00:05.873 --> 01:00:08.683
I'm the one who helped you
deal with the loss of your son.

964
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:13.690
- What was that again?

965
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:17.220
Say that again?

966
01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.603
You were here to help me when my son died?

967
01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:22.520
You know how you helped me?

968
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.240
You told me everything
happens for a reason.

969
01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.940
Now you tell me right now.
you tell me right now.

970
01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:29.390
what is the reason for a
six year old boy to die?

971
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.573
- I can't help you if you don't help me.

972
01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.540
When I testify. I will have to tell them

973
01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.083
that you were under no stress.

974
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:45.740
There was no good reason
for you to kill your wife.

975
01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:49.013
cut her up. and put her in the trash.

976
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.323
- [George] I didn't kill Veronica!

977
01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.693
- They will give you the death penalty.

978
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.870
- Yes. it was my knife.

979
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:20.410
I know it was my knife.

980
01:01:20.410 --> 01:01:23.520
but it wasn't me. you have to believe me.

981
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.743
I didn't...

982
01:01:28.012 --> 01:01:28.845
Kill her.

983
01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.553
- No one is going to believe you. George.

984
01:01:39.579 --> 01:01:40.900
But if you trust me...

985
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.210
Tell me about how it
was your wife Veronica

986
01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:52.443
who left your son alone.

987
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.683
George. tell me about.

988
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:58.460
tell me about all those
nightmares you've had

989
01:01:58.460 --> 01:01:59.550
since his death.

990
01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:00.383
Tell me about-

991
01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.216
- Wait.

992
01:02:06.175 --> 01:02:08.790
(tense music)

993
01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:10.760
Are you asking me to lie?

994
01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.933
- If you don't lie. you
don't have any hope.

995
01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:17.883
He lied.

996
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:20.870
And I wrote my report.

997
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.270
And then they caught him in the lie.

998
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:34.750
And now poor George is
set to fry. (laughing)

999
01:02:50.832 --> 01:02:53.499
(door creaking)

1000
01:02:57.921 --> 01:03:00.588
(door slamming)

1001
01:03:05.322 --> 01:03:06.322
- Cassandra.

1002
01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:10.383
- Bruce?

1003
01:03:12.642 --> 01:03:13.475
- Good.

1004
01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.720
Very good.

1005
01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:18.340
- Please let me go.

1006
01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:19.173
Please.

1007
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.403
- I need you to change.

1008
01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:30.230
- What?

1009
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:31.063
Why?

1010
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.330
- It's what I want.

1011
01:03:34.529 --> 01:03:37.113
- Please. tell me why
you want me to change.

1012
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:40.090
- Because we're meeting friends.

1013
01:03:42.032 --> 01:03:43.530
- And you don't think
your friends will like me

1014
01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:45.053
in this dress. Brian?

1015
01:03:47.074 --> 01:03:50.080
- Babe. we're going to Applebee's.

1016
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.280
not the Playboy mansion.

1017
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.623
- I've had a bad day.

1018
01:03:57.427 --> 01:03:58.427
I've had a bad week.

1019
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.763
It's been a bad fucking month.

1020
01:04:05.492 --> 01:04:07.997
The whole year's been fucking bad. Brian.

1021
01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:11.640
So I'm gonna wear this fucking dress now!

1022
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.133
Sorry. baby.

1023
01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:27.166
How did I?

1024
01:04:31.483 --> 01:04:34.900
(electronic dance music)

1025
01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:52.340
He's trying to wear you down with lights

1026
01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:53.303
and loud music.

1027
01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.143
Remember the story of Noriega in Panama?

1028
01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.650
He finally surrendered
after PSYOPS bombarded him

1029
01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:05.140
with lights and heavy metal music.

1030
01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.783
Why is he trying to break me?

1031
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:10.683
- [Kenny] Yo. Tara. you on the air?

1032
01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.120
- Yes. yes I'm here.

1033
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:16.953
He was just here.

1034
01:05:16.953 --> 01:05:18.308
He's using lights and music and-

1035
01:05:18.308 --> 01:05:20.071
- [Kenny] Yeah. you know. I
try them too. with my dates.

1036
01:05:20.071 --> 01:05:21.960
You know. a little romantic
music. candlelight.

1037
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.840
little some. you know. Kenny G.

1038
01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.770
Puts 'em in the mood.

1039
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:27.400
- He's not trying to date me. Bullet.

1040
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.766
- Oh. yeah. right. sorry. sorry.

1041
01:05:29.766 --> 01:05:31.360
didn't mean to.

1042
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.860
- Have you found out
anything else about this guy?

1043
01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:37.950
What about the names I gave you. anything?

1044
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:40.283
- [Kenny] Yeah. but you won't like it.

1045
01:05:41.487 --> 01:05:42.643
- I don't care. tell me.

1046
01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.993
- [Kenny] Sometimes what you
don't know won't hurt you.

1047
01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.453
- Got it. Kenny. just tell me.

1048
01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:51.620
- [Kenny] Okay. you just remember.

1049
01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:53.640
I gave you the chance not to know.

1050
01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.300
- Please. just tell me.

1051
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.133
- [Kenny] Okay.

1052
01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:59.470
I'll start with the names you gave me.

1053
01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:01.160
Timothy Harrison.

1054
01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.050
he was five years old
(suspenseful music)

1055
01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:04.560
when he went missing.

1056
01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:05.610
They never found him.

1057
01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:08.130
- How did he end up in here?

1058
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:10.040
- [Kenny] His family was
at a campground in Georgia.

1059
01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.990
Someone snatched him out of their tent.

1060
01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.970
- He used this RV to kidnap a child.

1061
01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.210
- [Kenny] Laura Kennington.
she went missing

1062
01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:20.043
when she was 18.

1063
01:06:20.945 --> 01:06:23.533
She was camping with some
friends in Louisiana.

1064
01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.513
- He's using this RV to-

1065
01:06:27.513 --> 01:06:29.730
- [Kenny] Yeah. her
parents committed suicide.

1066
01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:30.593
or so they say.

1067
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:35.330
A month after Laura went missing.

1068
01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:38.090
the neighbor found her
parents in their bedrooms

1069
01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:40.133
with bullet wounds in their heads.

1070
01:06:42.434 --> 01:06:46.560
- And you don't believe
it was suicide. why?

1071
01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.430
- [Kenny] Yeah. yeah.
yeah. they left a note

1072
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:50.920
saying some bullshit about
they had nothing to live for.

1073
01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.180
but I...

1074
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:53.013
- But what?

1075
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.313
- [Kenny] They didn't find the gun.

1076
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:58.320
You don't put a bullet in your head

1077
01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:00.283
then get up and you know. bury the gun.

1078
01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:03.007
They find the gun next to you.

1079
01:07:08.063 --> 01:07:10.090
- So you think he kidnapped Laura.

1080
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.980
went back to her house.
picked up some things

1081
01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:13.130
and killed her parents?

1082
01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:15.773
- [Kenny] That's what I would think.

1083
01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:19.310
- What about the phone number I gave you.

1084
01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:21.130
the street address?

1085
01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:23.570
- [Kenny] It comes back to
an Idaho State Park Office.

1086
01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:27.260
The address looks like it
was a mail drop. you know?

1087
01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:28.830
Just a bunch of PO boxes.

1088
01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:31.660
but people were using
it as an office address.

1089
01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.493
- Idaho?

1090
01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:35.670
- [Kenny] I looked at the State Park.

1091
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:37.610
There'd been over 15 missing persons

1092
01:07:37.610 --> 01:07:40.320
since early 1990s.

1093
01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.453
All from that park.

1094
01:07:43.722 --> 01:07:45.690
- He's using that RV to...

1095
01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.410
- [Kenny] Funny thing.
there was a park ranger

1096
01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:51.290
by the name of Emmett Jennings.

1097
01:07:51.290 --> 01:07:52.220
E. Jennings?

1098
01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:53.770
- So he's working with someone.

1099
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.383
- [Kenny] Well that's what it looks like.

1100
01:07:57.523 --> 01:08:00.523
(crickets chirping)

1101
01:08:08.704 --> 01:08:11.940
- There's something you're not telling me.

1102
01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:13.290
What are you not telling me?

1103
01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.710
- [Kenny] It's something
of an urban legend.

1104
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:17.410
probably just a bunch of bullshit.

1105
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.258
- Tell me.

1106
01:08:19.258 --> 01:08:21.253
- [Kenny] (sighing) Okay. here goes.

1107
01:08:22.639 --> 01:08:24.130
A couple of teenage girls reported

1108
01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:25.969
that they were camping around Jacksonville

1109
01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:28.697
and some older guy camped next to 'em.

1110
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.952
At first. you know. he was helpful.

1111
01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:34.069
He said his name was Bruce

1112
01:08:34.069 --> 01:08:36.673
and said he had a teenage
daughter named Tiffany.

1113
01:08:38.468 --> 01:08:40.440
- His daughter's name is Tiffany.

1114
01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.809
- [Kenny] Yeah.

1115
01:08:41.809 --> 01:08:45.753
Son's name was Billy and his
wife's name was Cassandra.

1116
01:08:47.219 --> 01:08:49.763
- Son's name was Billy.
his wife's name was...

1117
01:08:50.755 --> 01:08:52.673
He thinks I'm his wife.

1118
01:08:54.077 --> 01:08:56.360
- [Kenny] Well he was in an old RV.

1119
01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.830
Anyway. the girls got into the RV

1120
01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:59.889
and he gave them some Mary Jane.

1121
01:08:59.889 --> 01:09:01.450
And they started to get stoned

1122
01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:03.067
and he started coming on to 'em.

1123
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:05.300
The girls said that he told them

1124
01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.350
that he had been in the army.

1125
01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:09.200
Special Forces.

1126
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:11.700
when he pulled out some
logging chains and a lock.

1127
01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:14.490
- So did they run?

1128
01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:15.750
- [Kenny] Yeah. they ran.

1129
01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:17.410
Other people in the country have reported

1130
01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:19.490
seeing Bruce and the RV.

1131
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:21.389
- Is that it. that's all to the story?

1132
01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.760
- [Kenny] Well. I talked to some buddies

1133
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.760
and they said Bruce is a collector.

1134
01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:29.860
- What does that mean?

1135
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:35.389
- [Kenny] Yeah. from what the girls said.

1136
01:09:35.389 --> 01:09:37.450
while Bruce was on Operation Desert Storm.

1137
01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:40.170
his family back in Iowa was killed

1138
01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:41.563
in a robbery gone bad.

1139
01:09:42.895 --> 01:09:45.194
- But his wife. his
wife's name was Cassandra?

1140
01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:48.819
- [Kenny] Yeah. that's the story.

1141
01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:52.380
He's trying to collect the
family he lost. you get it?

1142
01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:56.389
Young son Billy. and the
teenage daughter Tiffany.

1143
01:09:56.389 --> 01:09:57.820
Fuck me.

1144
01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.870
I knew a Tiffany once.
she was smoking hot.

1145
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:01.969
She had these tits that were sticking out.

1146
01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:06.219
- And the location of the RV?

1147
01:10:07.777 --> 01:10:09.280
Do you have any leads on where I am?

1148
01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.112
- [Kenny] Look.

1149
01:10:11.389 --> 01:10:13.270
I don't want you to give up hope. huh?

1150
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:16.120
You give up hope and that's
when you start thinking about...

1151
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:18.830
- Putting a bullet through my head?

1152
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:20.660
- [Kenny] Well. you know what I mean.

1153
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.530
I'm still checking on the information.

1154
01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:24.480
I'll find you. you gotta believe in me.

1155
01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:32.780
- Thanks. Bullet.

1156
01:10:34.677 --> 01:10:37.100
- [Kenny] The only time you give up hope

1157
01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.100
is when you're dead.

1158
01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.850
Now stay strong. okay?

1159
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:43.343
Keep the faith. I'll talk to you later.

1160
01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:50.773
- Okay.

1161
01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.900
- [Kenny] Okay.

1162
01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:56.053
Turn off the radio and I'll
contact you at sunrise. okay?

1163
01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:01.123
- Yeah. yeah. sunrise.

1164
01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:12.862
Okay. so Bruce was in Special Forces.

1165
01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.900
You've counseled a lot
of Special Forces types.

1166
01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.850
Use what you know to find his weakness.

1167
01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.690
He lost a wife and son
while he was a soldier.

1168
01:11:22.690 --> 01:11:24.860
A young son and a teenage daughter.

1169
01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:25.809
The perfect family.

1170
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:28.500
He thinks the army fucked him over

1171
01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.350
by not protecting them. play to that.

1172
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:32.480
He might have his new wife

1173
01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:35.620
but you can tell him
where to get the children.

1174
01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.270
Play the role of the loving wife.

1175
01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:43.112
The Lima Syndrome.

1176
01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.770
where the abductor develops
sympathy for his hostage.

1177
01:11:57.170 --> 01:11:58.719
- He's not smart enough to win.

1178
01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:01.559
because he doesn't know me.

1179
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:08.350
I know every mind game there is to know.

1180
01:12:12.752 --> 01:12:13.919
I'm gonna win.

1181
01:12:23.572 --> 01:12:26.580
(laughing)

1182
01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.603
You were absolutely brilliant. Frank.

1183
01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.809
detailing how it was the army
who turned you into a rapist

1184
01:12:32.809 --> 01:12:34.333
if in fact you ever were one.

1185
01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.740
I must admit. it was
one of my better ideas.

1186
01:12:40.264 --> 01:12:42.170
- What happens now?

1187
01:12:42.170 --> 01:12:45.570
- Well now. you get a
dishonorable discharge.

1188
01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:47.702
two years in a halfway house. and.

1189
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:52.670
we continue our counseling sessions.

1190
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:56.610
Congratulations. Frank. you're a free man.

1191
01:12:57.987 --> 01:12:58.820
- Free?

1192
01:12:59.977 --> 01:13:01.782
What about what I've done?

1193
01:13:01.782 --> 01:13:03.563
What about the victims?

1194
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:08.750
- Well. a colleague of
mine who owed me a favor

1195
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:12.620
conducted the interviews
of the alleged victims.

1196
01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:15.030
And. well I don't think the officers

1197
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:17.120
of the current marshal board
were particularly pleased

1198
01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.780
to hear that the victims were.

1199
01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.733
for a lack of clinical terms. whores.

1200
01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.787
- But that doesn't make any sense.

1201
01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:34.253
- Frank.

1202
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:36.633
You're free.

1203
01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:39.820
And based on my observations.

1204
01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.410
the local DA also agreed
that you will not be required

1205
01:13:42.410 --> 01:13:45.593
to either report or
register as a sex offender.

1206
01:13:47.552 --> 01:13:50.052
(eerie music)

1207
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:54.930
Now you can go out there
and get that daycare job.

1208
01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.137
Just like you always dreamed about.

1209
01:14:01.251 --> 01:14:02.084
- Really?

1210
01:14:04.337 --> 01:14:07.811
I'm really free?

1211
01:14:07.811 --> 01:14:08.894
- Yes. Frank.

1212
01:14:11.568 --> 01:14:13.151
You're really free.

1213
01:14:15.246 --> 01:14:17.543
- You know. I raped all those women.

1214
01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.770
They weren't whores.

1215
01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:22.050
But what I did to them.

1216
01:14:23.243 --> 01:14:27.093
that was nothing compared to
what I did to these children.

1217
01:14:31.210 --> 01:14:32.454
Free?

1218
01:14:32.454 --> 01:14:34.050
(music intensifying)

1219
01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:36.115
Maybe death will set me free.

1220
01:14:36.115 --> 01:14:36.948
- Frank. no!

1221
01:14:36.948 --> 01:14:41.948
(gun firing)
(Tara gasping)

1222
01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.410
You're a trained psychologist.

1223
01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:53.500
You have listened to sad stories

1224
01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.760
from hundreds of crazy people.

1225
01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.773
You can do this.

1226
01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.200
Because you're much smarter.

1227
01:15:01.693 --> 01:15:02.527
Okay.

1228
01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:05.823
- You were right. Doc.

1229
01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:09.860
I just need to see how it felt

1230
01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:12.306
and it felt fucking amazing.

1231
01:15:12.306 --> 01:15:14.102
- You fucking bitch!

1232
01:15:14.102 --> 01:15:17.222
(knife slashing)
(grunting)

1233
01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:19.555
(screaming)

1234
01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.116
You fucking bitch!

1235
01:15:25.116 --> 01:15:27.366
It will never fucking stop!

1236
01:15:28.821 --> 01:15:31.154
(screaming)

1237
01:15:33.282 --> 01:15:34.282
- Cassandra.

1238
01:15:38.308 --> 01:15:39.891
- Help me. help me.

1239
01:15:44.734 --> 01:15:47.317
(thudding)

1240
01:15:47.317 --> 01:15:50.317
(light eerie music)

1241
01:15:56.219 --> 01:16:00.178
(light relaxing music)

1242
01:16:00.178 --> 01:16:01.011
- Mmm.

1243
01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:05.159
Baby.

1244
01:16:07.217 --> 01:16:09.413
You've really outdone yourself.

1245
01:16:13.639 --> 01:16:14.563
- Outdone myself?

1246
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:20.230
Well I guess that's my ultimate
duty in this life. right?

1247
01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:21.993
To keep you completely satisfied.

1248
01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.300
- No.

1249
01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.066
No. that's not what I was saying.

1250
01:16:26.066 --> 01:16:27.816
Just. I loved dinner.

1251
01:16:30.592 --> 01:16:32.259
It was great.

1252
01:16:32.259 --> 01:16:34.853
- (laughing) It's good.

1253
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:38.583
It's good.

1254
01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:41.570
You were always a good cook. Cassandra.

1255
01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:47.210
You should eat while it's hot.

1256
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:51.590
Unless you like eating those snacks.

1257
01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:58.309
Did the kids behave today?

1258
01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.063
- Oh. well. you know Billy.

1259
01:17:05.469 --> 01:17:07.930
he's six and he thinks he
should be driving already.

1260
01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:08.763
- Yeah.

1261
01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:10.532
Yeah.

1262
01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:14.487
- And Tiffany. well she wants a new dress.

1263
01:17:19.781 --> 01:17:21.698
- Just like her mother.

1264
01:17:23.068 --> 01:17:25.568
(eerie music)

1265
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:28.743
- So.

1266
01:17:30.105 --> 01:17:31.763
You know. I've told you about my day.

1267
01:17:32.797 --> 01:17:34.860
About. well. Ms. Peterson

1268
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:41.110
asking me to prescribe her
husband Viagra. you know

1269
01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:42.883
how that goes.

1270
01:17:42.883 --> 01:17:44.983
hopefully that never happens to us. but...

1271
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:49.797
Anyways. let's talk
about you for once. hm?

1272
01:17:50.785 --> 01:17:52.202
How was your day?

1273
01:17:54.582 --> 01:17:55.415
- Really?

1274
01:17:58.261 --> 01:18:00.969
You know everything I do is classified.

1275
01:18:00.969 --> 01:18:02.163
Do you really wanna risk me losing my job

1276
01:18:02.163 --> 01:18:03.993
just so we can bond over them?

1277
01:18:12.508 --> 01:18:17.508
(laughing) The look on
your face right now.

1278
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:19.573
Bruce?

1279
01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.090
I think after breakfast.

1280
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:25.040
we should take a drive like we used to.

1281
01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:31.653
- We never took drives.

1282
01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.350
You always got carsick.

1283
01:18:38.485 --> 01:18:40.320
You won't even go camping with me.

1284
01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:46.653
You said that's for redneck hillbillies.

1285
01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:54.073
- Really?

1286
01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.813
I never know when you're joking or not.

1287
01:19:03.469 --> 01:19:07.020
It's like you're just trying to play some

1288
01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:08.320
freaky mind games with me.

1289
01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:13.032
Walking on eggshells. not
knowing if I'm gonna offend you

1290
01:19:13.032 --> 01:19:16.680
or if I'm gonna say the wrong thing

1291
01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.330
and you're just gonna snap on me.

1292
01:19:23.170 --> 01:19:26.403
- I think after breakfast. which
you did a wonderful job at.

1293
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.610
we need to go pick up Billy and Tiffany

1294
01:19:29.610 --> 01:19:30.803
from my sister's.

1295
01:19:38.889 --> 01:19:40.139
- Do you think I'm crazy?

1296
01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:43.313
- No. of course. not.

1297
01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:47.430
I'm just reminding you that

1298
01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:51.593
Billy and Tiffany spent
the night at my sister's

1299
01:19:51.593 --> 01:19:53.143
and we need to go pick them up.

1300
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:04.653
- Tiffany was raped and gutted.

1301
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:10.973
Billy was hung from the kitchen light.

1302
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:14.223
They're both dead.

1303
01:20:15.930 --> 01:20:16.763
- [Brian] What?

1304
01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:20.493
- Look. Brian. you're a doctor. right?

1305
01:20:21.704 --> 01:20:23.980
And you treat the bodies of your clients.

1306
01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:26.754
Sort of like how a mechanic
works on a vehicle.

1307
01:20:26.754 --> 01:20:27.833
- (laughing) A mechanic?

1308
01:20:28.809 --> 01:20:31.389
No. I'm much more qualified

1309
01:20:31.389 --> 01:20:34.280
and higher above a mechanic.
- Whereas I treat the minds

1310
01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.500
of my clients.

1311
01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:36.830
- My pay grade is-
- Okay?

1312
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:39.809
You can't see the mind.
- Skyrocketing fast.

1313
01:20:39.809 --> 01:20:41.430
- That makes diagnosis
a lot more difficult

1314
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:43.639
than checking to see
whether Mr. Peterson's dick

1315
01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:44.678
is up or down.

1316
01:20:44.678 --> 01:20:46.610
It's hard. it's a trick.
- Okay. it's more complicated

1317
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:48.080
than just looking at a dick.

1318
01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.782
- I have to know
everything about my client.

1319
01:20:52.496 --> 01:20:56.063
(tense music)
- See. this is my party.

1320
01:20:57.809 --> 01:20:58.653
Not your party.

1321
01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:02.553
We do what I wanna do. not you.

1322
01:21:03.666 --> 01:21:05.389
You wanna play mind games?

1323
01:21:07.003 --> 01:21:08.643
Then I'll strip you naked.

1324
01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:13.273
bend you over this table. and
fuck you with a broomstick.

1325
01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:22.702
Best you eat this while it's hot.

1326
01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.574
What you don't eat. I will toss.

1327
01:21:27.574 --> 01:21:28.594
- Right. right. right.

1328
01:21:28.594 --> 01:21:29.428
You're giving me
- Why don't you shut up you

1329
01:21:29.428 --> 01:21:30.261
might just learn something.
- Fucking anxiety!

1330
01:21:30.261 --> 01:21:32.740
You're giving me anxiety.

1331
01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:33.573
Please. can we?
- You should fucking shut up

1332
01:21:33.573 --> 01:21:34.406
you actually learn something.
- Can we have

1333
01:21:34.406 --> 01:21:35.405
a normal conversation for once?

1334
01:21:35.405 --> 01:21:36.237
- No you be quiet.

1335
01:21:36.237 --> 01:21:37.357
and you shut up.
- We'll just have fun.

1336
01:21:37.357 --> 01:21:41.100
- If you fucking shut up you
would actually learn something.

1337
01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:41.950
What do you want?

1338
01:21:46.573 --> 01:21:49.740
- I want to eat my breakfast in peace.

1339
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.353
Now eat.

1340
01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.603
Or get fucked.

1341
01:21:59.853 --> 01:22:01.333
It don't make no difference to me.

1342
01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:08.419
- You're so on edge all the time.

1343
01:22:08.419 --> 01:22:10.818
You're gonna make me blow
my fucking brains out.

1344
01:22:17.111 --> 01:22:20.693
- I wonder who would
be the worse for that?

1345
01:22:27.130 --> 01:22:28.543
Excuse me. I need some air.

1346
01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.990
- I'll have to blindfold you.

1347
01:22:40.549 --> 01:22:42.377
- Yeah that's okay. I just need some air.

1348
01:23:00.827 --> 01:23:03.577
(birds chirping)

1349
01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.112
If I promise not to look.

1350
01:23:12.192 --> 01:23:13.791
will you take the blindfold off?

1351
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:19.490
- When I went to Kuwait.

1352
01:23:20.710 --> 01:23:23.053
they promise me that my
family would be safe.

1353
01:23:27.059 --> 01:23:27.950
Promises are like

1354
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:30.702
toilet paper.

1355
01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:33.850
It's nice when you need it.

1356
01:23:35.889 --> 01:23:37.463
But when you wipe your ass.

1357
01:23:39.469 --> 01:23:41.112
the promise is covered in shit.

1358
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:47.469
And it's only good to flush

1359
01:23:47.469 --> 01:23:49.202
along with all of the other shit.

1360
01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.362
- Very visual example.

1361
01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:58.753
Thank you so much for sharing.

1362
01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:03.910
- I think you've had enough fresh air.

1363
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:04.743
Let's go.

1364
01:24:04.743 --> 01:24:07.160
(chain clacking)

1365
01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.460
- [Tara] Please let me go.

1366
01:24:13.273 --> 01:24:14.107
- I can't.

1367
01:24:18.910 --> 01:24:20.510
- I know where you can get a son

1368
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.353
and a daughter.

1369
01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.210
And a much more beautiful wife.

1370
01:24:26.210 --> 01:24:27.510
- More beautiful than you?

1371
01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:32.553
- Yes. much more beautiful than me.

1372
01:24:35.414 --> 01:24:37.683
And she has a son and a daughter.

1373
01:24:39.536 --> 01:24:40.534
It's everything you want.

1374
01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:42.143
it's everything you've
been trying to find.

1375
01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:48.270
I can't have children.

1376
01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:54.940
- What's her name?

1377
01:24:57.710 --> 01:24:58.543
- Julie.

1378
01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.719
I can give you her address.

1379
01:25:01.719 --> 01:25:04.143
I can tell you how to get
to her and her children.

1380
01:25:20.230 --> 01:25:21.397
- We'll see. maybe.

1381
01:25:32.891 --> 01:25:35.558
(door slamming)

1382
01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.050
- Yeah. that's it.

1383
01:25:41.050 --> 01:25:43.430
Give him something to think about.

1384
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:45.309
Why go after the wife.
the son and daughter.

1385
01:25:45.309 --> 01:25:47.010
when you can get the whole family?

1386
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:57.340
Bullet.

1387
01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.170
Kenny. Bullet. it's me. Tara.

1388
01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:00.003
Are you there?

1389
01:26:01.055 --> 01:26:03.490
- [Kenny] I've been waiting all morning!

1390
01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:07.309
- Sorry. Bruce came in
and brought me breakfast.

1391
01:26:07.309 --> 01:26:08.620
- [Kenny] Nice. nice. terrific.

1392
01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:09.452
I hope you enjoyed it.

1393
01:26:09.452 --> 01:26:10.969
Are you two planning a wedding?

1394
01:26:13.410 --> 01:26:14.910
- Do you have any information?

1395
01:26:15.749 --> 01:26:17.700
Any news on where the RV might be?

1396
01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:20.889
Please. anything. just
give me some good news.

1397
01:26:20.889 --> 01:26:22.059
- [Kenny] This is the bad news.

1398
01:26:22.059 --> 01:26:23.540
Looking through the police reports.

1399
01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.280
- Police reports?

1400
01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.990
- [Kenny] Yeah. listen. I
got a buddy on the inside.

1401
01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:30.969
Seems as though that RV is
something of a community vehicle

1402
01:26:30.969 --> 01:26:33.433
for serial killers.

1403
01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:38.880
Sorry. it's passed from one
serial killer to another.

1404
01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:39.750
Not that I'm scaring ya.

1405
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:41.070
but if you believe in ghosts

1406
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:43.680
then your RV should be packed full of 'em

1407
01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.360
'cause there's been a
lot of killings inside

1408
01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.530
and a lot of.

1409
01:26:47.530 --> 01:26:50.353
well you know. the stuff that
goes on before the killing.

1410
01:26:51.650 --> 01:26:53.350
- So you can't track its location?

1411
01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:55.870
- [Kenny] That's a negative.

1412
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:57.130
You're in a field. right?

1413
01:26:57.130 --> 01:26:59.467
Can you tell me something about it?

1414
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:02.020
- He took me outside earlier

1415
01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:03.940
but I had something on my face.

1416
01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:05.413
- [Kenny] Jeez. are you that ugly?

1417
01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.880
- Bullet. I couldn't see anything. okay?

1418
01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:11.860
- [Kenny] Did you smell anything?

1419
01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:14.260
I don't know. like the smell of alfalfa.

1420
01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:17.230
corn. pig shit. something else to help.

1421
01:27:17.230 --> 01:27:19.513
Did you hear cows. maybe horses. anything?

1422
01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:21.803
- Amaranth.

1423
01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:24.643
I smelled Amaranth.

1424
01:27:25.809 --> 01:27:28.300
Everywhere I turned. I could smell that.

1425
01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:29.653
- [Kenny] Amaranth?

1426
01:27:29.653 --> 01:27:31.540
Well if you smelled it
from every direction

1427
01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:33.603
then it could be a landscaper.

1428
01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:35.870
Okay. anything else?

1429
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:37.719
Think. did you hear a train.

1430
01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:39.333
maybe a airplane flew over.

1431
01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:42.440
- Yes. yes. there was a airplane.

1432
01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.840
- [Kenny] When?

1433
01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:46.070
- I don't know. 10 minutes ago.

1434
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:48.620
And it was loud. like a commercial jet.

1435
01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:51.120
- [Kenny] Okay. okay. this
is good. this is good.

1436
01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:53.650
A landscape business that raises Amaranth

1437
01:27:53.650 --> 01:27:56.993
and is in the flight
path of a commercial jet.

1438
01:27:58.222 --> 01:27:59.300
Think. use your head.

1439
01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.900
What else did you hear or smell?

1440
01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.010
- There were birds.

1441
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:08.670
Like they were high above me.

1442
01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:11.103
But there were birds. lots of them.

1443
01:28:11.103 --> 01:28:13.440
- [Kenny] Okay. okay.
okay. good. good. good.

1444
01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:16.160
A field bordered by tall
trees. this is good.

1445
01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:17.510
- Yeah. yeah. this is good.

1446
01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.133
Bullet.

1447
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:28.463
Hey. Bullet.

1448
01:28:30.450 --> 01:28:31.420
Are you not telling me something?

1449
01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:32.253
What's going on?

1450
01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.300
- [Kenny] You really wanna know?

1451
01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.460
- Yeah. yeah. tell me.

1452
01:28:40.410 --> 01:28:44.139
- [Kenny] The way all these
serial killers. like Bruce.

1453
01:28:44.139 --> 01:28:45.950
have been able to keep killing people

1454
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:48.380
is that they either hold their captive

1455
01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:50.550
for a maximum of four days

1456
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:51.800
or they just move the RV.

1457
01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.393
- Are you saying I don't have much time?

1458
01:28:56.732 --> 01:28:58.190
- [Kenny] Hey. hey. hey. hey.

1459
01:28:58.190 --> 01:29:00.210
Don't get all girly on me. okay?

1460
01:29:00.210 --> 01:29:01.680
I'll find you. don't worry about it.

1461
01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.469
But if you think he's gonna move the RV.

1462
01:29:04.469 --> 01:29:07.273
you gotta let me know. okay. like ASAP.

1463
01:29:08.987 --> 01:29:09.821
Do you hear me?

1464
01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:13.889
- Yes. I heard you.

1465
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:18.889
- [Kenny] All right. Jesus.
okay let me do some checking.

1466
01:29:18.889 --> 01:29:19.723
I'll hit you up at sunset

1467
01:29:19.723 --> 01:29:21.523
so don't turn off the radio. okay?

1468
01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:24.000
Just keep the faith.
it'll be okay. really.

1469
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:24.913
- Okay. Bullet.

1470
01:30:03.139 --> 01:30:06.660
- Captain. I don't want you
to take this personally.

1471
01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:08.500
This is not a personal attack.

1472
01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:10.200
- Yes sir. I-
- But there seems to be

1473
01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:12.840
a pattern developing among the patients

1474
01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.460
that you're treating.

1475
01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:15.293
- Sir. I believe that-

1476
01:30:15.293 --> 01:30:16.243
- Let me finish.

1477
01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:21.240
Now I fully acknowledge that

1478
01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.740
since we began the war in Afghanistan.

1479
01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:26.090
the number of suicides
among returning veterans

1480
01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:27.433
has greatly increased.

1481
01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:33.920
But Captain. the majority of the soldiers

1482
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:35.433
that you were treating.

1483
01:30:38.059 --> 01:30:38.893
let me be blunt.

1484
01:30:41.059 --> 01:30:44.400
You are one of the few counselors we have

1485
01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.000
that has a higher percentage

1486
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.500
of suicides among the men they're treating

1487
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.830
than non-suicides.

1488
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:53.050
- Colonel. sir. respectfully.

1489
01:30:53.050 --> 01:30:55.583
you cannot be saying that
I'm not being successful.

1490
01:30:58.710 --> 01:31:01.190
I'm prepared to go through each
and every one of my patients

1491
01:31:01.190 --> 01:31:03.280
and provide a thorough
detailed explanation

1492
01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.980
for their psychological issues!

1493
01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:06.927
All of which might I add.
were pre-existing conditions.

1494
01:31:06.927 --> 01:31:07.760
- I don't think that-

1495
01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.030
- And in references to percentages.

1496
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.219
you might want to consider that

1497
01:31:10.219 --> 01:31:11.900
as opposed to other counselors.

1498
01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:14.340
my caseload is predominantly
composed of operators

1499
01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:16.130
in the Special Forces Unit.

1500
01:31:16.130 --> 01:31:18.240
And being a member of
the Special Forces Unit

1501
01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.032
I might suggest already
indicate psychological issues.

1502
01:31:22.272 --> 01:31:25.530
- If one more of your
patients commits suicide.

1503
01:31:25.530 --> 01:31:26.710
I think it will be time for you

1504
01:31:26.710 --> 01:31:28.530
to start considering other options.

1505
01:31:31.564 --> 01:31:32.523
- Other options. sir?

1506
01:31:32.523 --> 01:31:33.973
What other options?

1507
01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.440
- You're young and you're talented.

1508
01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:39.110
Get out of the military.

1509
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:41.570
Start a private practice. make some money.

1510
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:44.059
But I can't keep trying to explain

1511
01:31:44.059 --> 01:31:47.430
how 90% of the soldiers
that you're treating

1512
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:49.780
ends up committing suicide.

1513
01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:50.980
or hurting other people.

1514
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:53.700
We're here to help them.

1515
01:31:54.639 --> 01:31:56.344
not push them over the edge.

1516
01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:58.512
- [Man] Is that you. Tara?

1517
01:31:59.727 --> 01:32:01.477
- Kenny. is that you?

1518
01:32:03.807 --> 01:32:04.865
- No.

1519
01:32:04.865 --> 01:32:06.865
My handle's Pill Popper.

1520
01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.313
- What?

1521
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:12.750
- [Pill Popper] Bullet asked
me to make some research

1522
01:32:12.750 --> 01:32:15.253
and I think I've narrowed
down your location.

1523
01:32:16.730 --> 01:32:18.730
- You know where I am?

1524
01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:20.070
- [Pill Popper] Yeah. but let me make sure

1525
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:21.957
that Bullet told me right.

1526
01:32:21.957 --> 01:32:24.340
You can smell Amaranth on all four sides.

1527
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.540
You're in a flight path.

1528
01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:28.210
and you can hear birds in tall trees.

1529
01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:29.577
Is that all right?

1530
01:32:29.577 --> 01:32:32.680
- Yes. yes. that's right. that's right.

1531
01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.862
- [Pill Popper] This
actually makes more sense.

1532
01:32:36.639 --> 01:32:38.660
- It makes sense?

1533
01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:40.900
- [Pill Popper] There's an
abandoned landscaping company

1534
01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:43.270
called Chamber's Cherubs.

1535
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:46.250
They were one of the main
suppliers of Amaranth

1536
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:47.500
until they went bankrupt.

1537
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:50.400
They haven't been able
to sell the property

1538
01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:53.003
because it's located on a new flight path.

1539
01:32:54.023 --> 01:32:55.666
- So you know where I am?

1540
01:32:55.666 --> 01:32:57.790
- [Pill Popper] I'm
looking at the aerial photo

1541
01:32:57.790 --> 01:33:00.070
and there's a wide open field

1542
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:01.403
bordered by tall trees.

1543
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:05.710
Looks like an old RV parked in the middle.

1544
01:33:06.587 --> 01:33:09.112
- That's me. that's me. that's me.

1545
01:33:09.112 --> 01:33:10.009
Call the cops please.

1546
01:33:10.009 --> 01:33:12.509
Please call the cops right now!

1547
01:33:12.509 --> 01:33:16.925
- [Pill Popper] Darling.
I'd love to call the police.

1548
01:33:19.286 --> 01:33:21.934
(thudding)
See?

1549
01:33:21.934 --> 01:33:23.936
- Conspiracy nut jobs.

1550
01:33:23.936 --> 01:33:26.782
- [Pill Popper] I'm dead.

1551
01:33:26.782 --> 01:33:28.478
- He's not gonna call the police.

1552
01:33:28.478 --> 01:33:30.183
he's not gonna call the police.

1553
01:33:30.183 --> 01:33:33.750
He fucking knows where I am.
he won't call the police!

1554
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:37.250
(sobbing) Fucking idiots.

1555
01:33:38.707 --> 01:33:41.260
Sorry. sorry. can you say that again?

1556
01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:42.750
I'm sorry. I didn't hear that last part.

1557
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.519
Can you say again?

1558
01:33:44.519 --> 01:33:46.300
- [Pill Popper] Dead. I'm dead.

1559
01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:58.059
Not even an innocent. unborn
baby wanted to come out of you.

1560
01:33:58.059 --> 01:33:59.773
Your baby killed herself.

1561
01:34:01.037 --> 01:34:03.704
(ominous music)

1562
01:34:11.271 --> 01:34:12.188
- The fuck?

1563
01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:16.489
- [Pill Popper] Everyone
you know. you've killed.

1564
01:34:16.489 --> 01:34:18.260
- You killed me.

1565
01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:19.447
You killed me.

1566
01:34:20.959 --> 01:34:23.291
(screaming)

1567
01:34:24.846 --> 01:34:27.449
- [Pill Popper] You
pushed them over the edge

1568
01:34:27.449 --> 01:34:29.449
playing your mind games.

1569
01:34:30.858 --> 01:34:33.358
(tense music)

1570
01:34:49.809 --> 01:34:50.936
Do it!

1571
01:34:50.936 --> 01:34:52.257
End the pain!

1572
01:34:52.257 --> 01:34:54.023
You'll be saving lives.

1573
01:34:58.791 --> 01:35:02.041
(lightly somber music)

1574
01:36:12.582 --> 01:36:14.249
- What do you think?

1575
01:36:15.304 --> 01:36:18.200
- I think we just about
got our drug perfected.

1576
01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:19.273
that's what I think.

1577
01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:23.360
They keeping that same fucking name?

1578
01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.804
- Yeah.

1579
01:36:24.804 --> 01:36:25.637
- Well.

1580
01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:32.389
- People see what they wanna see.

1581
01:36:33.370 --> 01:36:34.950
And then they create reality based

1582
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:36.503
on what they believe they see.

1583
01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.660
- Well I gotta tell you.

1584
01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:44.660
I really thought you blew your
fucking brains out out there.

1585
01:36:48.309 --> 01:36:50.227
- Is this drug working?

1586
01:36:51.719 --> 01:36:54.023
- Yes. the drug is infallible.

1587
01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:57.630
- I can't believe that she thought

1588
01:36:57.630 --> 01:36:59.710
you were gonna actually marry her.

1589
01:36:59.710 --> 01:37:01.423
That's unbelievable to me.

1590
01:37:02.809 --> 01:37:05.630
- Well. some people are too blind

1591
01:37:05.630 --> 01:37:07.073
to see the true reality.

1592
01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.233
She was never in an RV.

1593
01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:12.833
Only chained in her mind.

1594
01:37:18.710 --> 01:37:21.510
The drug blurs the lines between reality

1595
01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:22.760
and the perception of it.

1596
01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:26.362
allowing people to
inhabit false realities.

1597
01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:29.630
I'm surprised it worked so well

1598
01:37:29.630 --> 01:37:31.650
on a trained psychologist.

1599
01:37:31.650 --> 01:37:33.290
Someone who is supposed to see

1600
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:34.833
through the lies of deception.

1601
01:37:38.005 --> 01:37:41.005
(tense eerie music)

1602
01:37:50.263 --> 01:37:51.096
- Bruce!

1603
01:37:52.219 --> 01:37:53.563
De opresso de libre!

1604
01:37:57.017 --> 01:37:58.313
To free the opressed.

1605
01:38:02.299 --> 01:38:05.716
You know. the mind makes its own reality.

1606
01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.740
Makes its own terror. yeah.

1607
01:38:14.817 --> 01:38:16.900
Plays almost like a game.

1608
01:38:21.639 --> 01:38:22.807
- A mind game.

1609
01:38:31.501 --> 01:38:34.001
(eerie music)
