00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:17.118
(Ominous music)

4
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.299
[Director] This is a film
about storytelling.

5
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.220
About how we tell the story
of our country's past.

6
00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:40.100
Why do we want to believe
one version and not another?

7
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:42.894
Maybe because it makes
us feel safe at night.

8
00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.189
There's one episode

9
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:49.109
of America's history that is
told very differently.

10
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.320
depending on who you
are and where you live.

11
00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:56.741
It is the story of our civil
war and what came after.

12
00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.454
(explosion)

13
00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:04.457
(drums)

14
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.255
- The hot winds of
war blew across

15
00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:14.426
the land. made of it
a country divided.

16
00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:19.806
Friend turned into foe.
brother fought against brother.

17
00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:23.476
It was such a long
and drawn out

18
00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:27.731
struggle and a feeling
on both sides was so intense.

19
00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:39.409
- We're all just romantics lost

20
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.162
in contemporary times.
you might say every one of us

21
00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:45.874
feels like we born
125 years too late.

22
00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.588
(slow music)

23
00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:58.845
- To introduce myself.
my name is Rachel Boynton.

24
00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:00.764
This is Nelson Walker.

25
00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:03.933
We are independent
documentary filmmakers.

26
00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:07.687
We're making a film about how we
tell the story of the Civil War.

27
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.731
We're filming in lots of
different schools

28
00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.316
all over the country.

29
00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.277
And going to places with a deep
connection to this history.

30
00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:17.489
(loud cheering)

31
00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:20.575
- There's a lot more coming.

32
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.875
[Student] What made you choose
the civil war

33
00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.377
and reconstruction?

34
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:32.545
[Director] Well. you know.
America is kind of like a big

35
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:36.007
family that tore itself
apart during the civil war.

36
00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.218
And in order to make peace.

37
00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.804
we told ourselves
a certain story about it.

38
00:03:40.845 --> 00:03:43.223
And for a long time.
we had trouble telling

39
00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:46.935
the difference between
that story and the truth.

40
00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:48.436
You can ask me
anything you want.

41
00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:49.979
[Student] What did you
want to do when you

42
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.106
were little and did you have

43
00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:53.983
a backup for if you
couldn't get that?

44
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.653
[Director] When I was really
little. I wanted to be Superman.

45
00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:59.489
When I got a little bit older. I
wanted to be an anthropologist.

46
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.907
Do you know what an
anthropologists is?

47
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.325
- No
- Somebody

48
00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.576
who goes around the
world and studies the way other

49
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:05.370
people live like this.
- So like this?

50
00:04:05.412 --> 00:04:06.913
[Director] Kind of like this.

51
00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.415
Yeah.

52
00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:10.333
[Isabel] People are
having to come

53
00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.128
to grips with the civil war
and enslavement.

54
00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.923
which are the sort of founding
bases of the country.

55
00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:20.343
Our country is like
a really old house.

56
00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:21.636
You may not want to go

57
00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.930
into that basement.
but if you really don't go

58
00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.558
into that basement.
it's at your own peril.

59
00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.560
Whatever you're
ignoring will be

60
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:32.355
there to be reckoned
with until you reckon with it.

61
00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.360
(ominous music)

62
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.790
(children talking)

63
00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.475
[Instructor] These voices
were all happening

64
00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:10.477
on the eve of the civil war.

65
00:05:10.518 --> 00:05:11.895
I'm interested in what
you think about it.

66
00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:14.606
I'm interested in who.
who's saying this.

67
00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:15.857
And I'm also
going to give you

68
00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:19.152
the secession documents
from South Carolina.

69
00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.696
Where is he from?
What's what's he about?

70
00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.156
Who is he?

71
00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.075
[Student] He's a Philadelphia
congressman. I believe.

72
00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.452
[Instructor] No. Ohio.
I think he's from Ohio.

73
00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.496
So he delivers this when?

74
00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:32.374
When is this written?
Because that's one of the

75
00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.917
questions that I asked.
- December. 22nd. 1860.

76
00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.001
[Instructor] Exactly.

77
00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.711
And what is he basically saying?

78
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:38.672
- He doesn't
want secession

79
00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:40.924
because he knows
if there is secession

80
00:05:40.965 --> 00:05:42.509
there will be a huge war.

81
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.386
[Instructor] People will know
this war with their own eyes.

82
00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:48.765
They will. you know. really
experience war amongst
ourselves.

83
00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:50.517
He sounds scared. doesn't he?
[Student] Yeah.

84
00:05:50.558 --> 00:05:52.644
[Instructor] Yeah.
I think he probably was.

85
00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.355
What stood out to you
in the arguments?

86
00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:57.399
[Student] So our article
was presented

87
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.360
by Alexander Stephens
in Atlanta. Georgia.

88
00:06:00.402 --> 00:06:01.778
And not once does
he talk about

89
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.407
slavery. property
and what the war is really

90
00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:07.409
about. what they're really
fighting for.

91
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.911
[Instructor] Other voices?
Yeah.

92
00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.581
[Student] I noticed
there seems to be

93
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:19.462
a common idea that the civil
war was totally about slavery.

94
00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:21.047
I'm going to disagree with that.

95
00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.258
The South did want to leave

96
00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:27.429
the union because of slavery.
but the issue of the Civil War

97
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.348
was keeping the south
in the union.

98
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.809
So slavery isn't like

99
00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:36.521
the entire issue.
- Push back? Comments?

100
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.273
(school bell rings)

101
00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:39.983
We will continue tomorrow.

102
00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:42.902
(student chatter)

103
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.238
[Instructor] You are a thinker.

104
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.656
That is for sure.

105
00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:48.658
The wedge is the slavery
issue. right?

106
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.909
I think we're agreed on that.

107
00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.745
It's just a way
of describing it.

108
00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.080
Yeah.
Good. good job.

109
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.206
Go. go. go.

110
00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:56.416
[Director] You're
spending a lot of time

111
00:06:56.458 --> 00:06:58.001
telling the story
of the Civil War

112
00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.795
and Reconstruction in your
eighth grade class.

113
00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:02.130
Why?

114
00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.799
- Because I think

115
00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:09.179
we have not adequately.

116
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.850
you know. understood
who we are as a nation.

117
00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.769
There's so much of this history

118
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.689
that has been way too difficult
for this country to look at.

119
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:21.274
The reason it's important

120
00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:24.235
to understand this history is
because we carry it within us.

121
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.781
These things need to be unpacked
and looked at and talked about

122
00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:31.284
and and we need to decide
what we think about them now.

123
00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:35.205
It's challenging. but it's.
it's where the juice is.

124
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:41.878
(distant dog bark)

125
00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:50.136
- We call it a war between
the states here.

126
00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.638
We don't call it a civil war.

127
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.181
[Director] Why is it
important to cause

128
00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.140
the war between the states?

129
00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.433
- Because that's what it was.

130
00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.643
It wasn't a civil war.

131
00:07:56.685 --> 00:07:59.521
[Herb] Or the war of
northern aggression.

132
00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.980
The North came down
here and divided us.

133
00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.191
We didn't go up there.
- My grandmother was saying they

134
00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.985
had to hide the food
in the chimney because

135
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.488
the soldiers came in.
would take everything they had.

136
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.658
They took all their livestock.
any food that was in the house.

137
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.034
It was terrible.

138
00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:17.163
And the war took place
in our backyard.

139
00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:20.583
But the people up north.
the war was a distant thing.

140
00:08:21.209 --> 00:08:24.212
We're both members of the local
Sons of Confederate Veterans

141
00:08:24.254 --> 00:08:28.174
and we are responsible for
taking care of this cemetery.

142
00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:29.342
But I'm afraid when the Herb

143
00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:32.554
are gone and our
generations. that it'll.

144
00:08:33.388 --> 00:08:35.807
there's not gonna be anybody
around to take care of it.

145
00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.518
[Herb] Or to promote
the true history

146
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.937
of the 1860-1865
period of time.

147
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.772
[Director] This class
that I'm filming.

148
00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:45.150
the teacher is teaching the
cause of the war is slavery.

149
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:46.860
- Oh. really?

150
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.778
[Director] And so

151
00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.656
does that offend you?
[Herb] Yes.

152
00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:53.533
[Director] can you
explain to me why?

153
00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:54.868
[Herb] Because it's not true.

154
00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.870
You're telling stories
that aren't true about

155
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:01.750
my my ancestry. about my family.
about my country. the south.

156
00:09:02.125 --> 00:09:03.168
[Director] And what's.
tell me what

157
00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:06.755
the untrue thing is?
[Herb] Slavery.

158
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.008
They are not
telling the whole story.

159
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.843
Slavery was
one of the reasons.

160
00:09:11.885 --> 00:09:15.388
But but for that professor
to say that economics

161
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.475
had nothing to do with that war
is totally false.

162
00:09:18.516 --> 00:09:19.976
- I would have fought
for the South.

163
00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.479
You know why? It had nothing
to do with political reason.

164
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.272
Because my home
was being invaded.

165
00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:30.070
(somber music)

166
00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:36.576
[Dr. Blight] The Confederacy
lost this war big time.

167
00:09:36.618 --> 00:09:38.745
No Americans have ever lost

168
00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:42.832
a war quite like
the Confederacy. lost this war.

169
00:09:46.294 --> 00:09:48.963
(slow music)

170
00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:55.345
White southerners are going

171
00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:59.432
to need to process what
the meaning of that whole

172
00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:02.310
collapse of their
society really is.

173
00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:09.776
And their explanation of their
defeat becomes a narrative.

174
00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:12.862
It becomes a memory.

175
00:10:12.904 --> 00:10:15.782
it becomes the lost cause
tradition

176
00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:18.993
and the lost cause tradition was
this argument

177
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:22.914
that the Confederacy had
really fought for noble aims.

178
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.542
The war wasn't really
entirely about slavery.

179
00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.918
It was about defending their

180
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.464
homelands.
their families. their women.

181
00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:37.262
The slavery was not the great
issue. If it were left to them.

182
00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:40.348
they would have handled slavery
over time and maybe even gotten

183
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.728
rid of it themselves.
they said. which is nonsense.

184
00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:46.479
There were alternative textbooks

185
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.899
eventually published
in the South.

186
00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:52.902
and it wasn't just textbooks
they were trying to control.

187
00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:58.199
It was the stories being widely
told in the public arena.

188
00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:01.369
and they had
a tremendous influence.

189
00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:03.580
So what is at stake
in the memory

190
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:08.168
of the American Civil War. is
who gets to control this
narrative?

191
00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:09.419
The story.

192
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.630
[Director] Ok. wait. I've got
to move the microphone

193
00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:13.882
before I get started.

194
00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.342
Yeah.

195
00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:19.220
Do you have any
questions for me?

196
00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.807
[Student] I had one.
I forgot what it was.

197
00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:31.524
Do you consider yourself
a radical person?

198
00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:33.985
[Director] Am I a radical
person?

199
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:39.199
No. I'm not a radical person.
I think I'm someone

200
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.203
who questions things.
I'm questioning the stories we

201
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:47.248
tell. like in your class.
the story about slavery. right?

202
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.335
They tell us something
about why we're so divided.

203
00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.879
Do you see us living
in a divided country?

204
00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.047
- Every day.

205
00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:01.012
(somber music)

206
00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:09.229
(somber music)

207
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:22.784
(somber music)

208
00:12:31.918 --> 00:12:34.462
(children chatter)

209
00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.431
(children chatter)

210
00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:49.227
[Student] The Holmes
Central High School creed.

211
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.604
I am a member of the Holmes
Central High School family.

212
00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:53.440
Education first our motto.

213
00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:58.069
[Instructor] The kids that I
have here are determined to not

214
00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:01.072
follow in the footsteps
of what was in the past.

215
00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:04.451
I'm hoping I can spark
something to say.

216
00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:05.952
I want to know more.

217
00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:09.122
I want to learn more.
[Director] In Mississippi.

218
00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:12.876
do people talk about slavery
as the cause of the war?

219
00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:13.877
[Instructor] You don't
really hear the word

220
00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:16.212
slavery or slaves
in Mississippi.

221
00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.715
That was an incidental
part of it.

222
00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:21.009
I guess the simple
term is whitewash.

223
00:13:21.051 --> 00:13:23.845
As I told my clients. is that

224
00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:27.849
a lot of time you want to
see the good part

225
00:13:27.891 --> 00:13:29.684
of the history.
especially the history that you

226
00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:33.396
are part of.
and you want to minimize

227
00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:36.816
the bad part about it.

228
00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:41.112
Slavery is not an easy topic to
tackle for black or for white.

229
00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:44.157
[Director] So how do you tackle
the story of slavery?

230
00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:46.534
[Instructor] One thing
is that. the slaves

231
00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:50.330
were more powerful than
you give them credit for.

232
00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:52.999
[Student] People say
that Lincoln freed

233
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.795
the slaves. but you say
actually they freed themselves.

234
00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.089
[Instructor] That
was a question?

235
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.132
- Why couldn't
slaves free themselves

236
00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:05.887
in a sense. before all of
this if they freed themselves?

237
00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:09.516
[Instructor] We didn't have the
abolition. We we did have was

238
00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:12.602
Nat Turner. you know. you had
those people who step forward.

239
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.690
Those people to me were
just as brave

240
00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:20.068
as the 1960's.
probably more brave.

241
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.194
[Student] Come on.

242
00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:24.155
[Instructor] Think about
Nat Turner.

243
00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:25.532
[Student] Slave.
He's crazy.

244
00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.742
To make a change. you got
to be a little crazy.

245
00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:30.578
[Instructor] That's it. He
calls people to think. He went

246
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.916
from plantation to plantation.
killing everybody.

247
00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.795
And he wanted to kill
the women and children.

248
00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:41.006
He wanted to do that. why?

249
00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:42.966
[Student] you expect for a
dude to be dead.

250
00:14:43.008 --> 00:14:45.760
you expect our mother.
three kids. stuff like that

251
00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:47.679
the pay. you got
him. If you want them.

252
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:49.222
he's dead.
He set the right tone.

253
00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:52.726
You out here killing wives.
children. Oh yeah.

254
00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.978
[Student] He probably was
a grumpy slave owner anyway.

255
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.314
[Instructor] Don't take for
granted the lives that were
lost.

256
00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:01.443
Who was brave enough to try
to system when it's wrong?

257
00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:05.030
That's what makes these
guys to be heroic.

258
00:15:05.071 --> 00:15:07.615
We can't devalue what we did.

259
00:15:07.657 --> 00:15:09.617
A white guy whose grandfather

260
00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:13.538
was a confederate and they
can't keep their memory alive.

261
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.248
Why can't we?

262
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.633
[Student] In Holmes County.

263
00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:30.263
I noticed how we had
the Browns and the Williams.

264
00:15:30.305 --> 00:15:33.892
I mean. we also had Caucasian
people with the same last name.

265
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.769
And I was I always
wondering. like.

266
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.605
is there a relation
between the two?

267
00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.273
And then I learned that.

268
00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:43.068
you know. slaves got their last
names from their slave owners.

269
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:47.864
So is like. did
this family own this

270
00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:52.452
family or like did they? I
always wondered about that.

271
00:15:52.494 --> 00:15:54.913
[Director] There's this
enormous history

272
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:56.456
of slavery in Holmes County.

273
00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:59.626
Do people ever talk about that?
[Student] About?

274
00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:03.171
[Director] Just the question
of the history of slavery here?

275
00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:06.466
- No.

276
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.472
[Director] Do you know if your
ancestors were enslaved here?

277
00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:14.391
- I don't know.

278
00:16:14.432 --> 00:16:15.975
[Director] Would you
want to know?

279
00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:18.061
- Not really.
[Director] Why?

280
00:16:18.103 --> 00:16:20.605
- Because I don't
want to

281
00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:24.025
think about what all they
went through for us.

282
00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:25.485
[Director] How come?

283
00:16:25.527 --> 00:16:30.824
- Because they
worked for all their life being

284
00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:34.285
enslaved and not
being treated right.

285
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.871
They'll just bring

286
00:16:36.913 --> 00:16:41.668
me down because they suffered
and I wish somebody could've

287
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.587
did something back then
to help them out.

288
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.172
[Director] And so you don't
want to think

289
00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:47.424
about it because
it makes you sad.

290
00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:48.758
- Mm hmm.

291
00:16:49.217 --> 00:16:52.303
- I don't want
to hate people.

292
00:16:52.345 --> 00:16:58.476
And I want to hate
people based on their

293
00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:03.356
character towards me now.
not what they did

294
00:17:03.398 --> 00:17:05.984
hundreds of years
to go or their family did

295
00:17:06.026 --> 00:17:07.402
hundreds of years ago.

296
00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:09.029
[Director] I think white
people are afraid

297
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.739
that it's going to make
them feel ashamed.

298
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.866
- Yeah.
I think so. too.

299
00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:17.537
That's why it's. they probably
when they're teaching.

300
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.748
I know I keep going back to.
you know. the teaching. But it's

301
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:23.460
where it all starts
because I doubt you. if

302
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:28.089
a white man would tell his six
year old daughter.

303
00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:32.177
we own slaves or we did
this to slaves or like.

304
00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:33.970
I doubt if that happens.

305
00:17:34.012 --> 00:17:38.350
- I think we all should
learn the real history because

306
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.227
as black people. we think
we know. but we don't.

307
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.396
I never met my great

308
00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:48.318
grandmother. and. you know.
they don't talk about slavery.

309
00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.321
and the racial desegregation.

310
00:17:51.363 --> 00:17:53.239
They don't talk about it.

311
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.075
[Director] Would you want
to ask her about it?

312
00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:57.077
- I would.

313
00:17:57.118 --> 00:17:59.079
but I wouldn't.

314
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.042
I think she would say she don't
know. to avoid the conversation.

315
00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:06.086
[Director] And why do
you think she would

316
00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:07.462
want to avoid the conversation?

317
00:18:09.673 --> 00:18:11.966
- It might hurt her.

318
00:18:12.008 --> 00:18:14.761
she might feel mad about it.

319
00:18:15.929 --> 00:18:17.430
[Director] It's hard to talk
about things like that.

320
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:18.640
- Yeah.

321
00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:31.152
(slow music)

322
00:18:48.044 --> 00:18:50.755
[Instructor] It's personal
around here. we're in a southern

323
00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:53.341
city and we're talking
about the civil war.

324
00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:56.970
And I'm going to have students

325
00:18:57.012 --> 00:18:59.347
who are pulling
for the Confederacy.

326
00:18:59.389 --> 00:19:00.807
I was that student. I pulled

327
00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:03.309
for the Confederacy
because they're southern.

328
00:19:03.351 --> 00:19:04.602
I'm Southern. right.

329
00:19:04.644 --> 00:19:06.813
And it's not about
slavery in your mind.

330
00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:09.482
It's just like it's the Cowboys
versus the Redskins.

331
00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:11.985
And you want the Cowboys to win
the football game. right?

332
00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:13.987
That's what it is in their head.

333
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:18.366
So when you throw slavery
in there. it complicates it.

334
00:19:19.534 --> 00:19:21.119
It's not a football game.

335
00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.204
This was real.

336
00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:25.331
Most history classes we teach

337
00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:27.709
that the winners write
history. the civil war.

338
00:19:27.751 --> 00:19:29.878
the losers end up
writing the history.

339
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:32.422
When we look
at Southerners and how they try

340
00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:35.008
to twist the narrative of what
happens. I want us to put

341
00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.469
ourselves in their shoes
and look at why.

342
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:39.929
If you can teach empathy
when it comes to history.

343
00:19:39.971 --> 00:19:41.014
I think it's such a powerful

344
00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:42.891
thing for the rest
of your lives.

345
00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:45.560
All right. boys. in your packet.

346
00:19:45.602 --> 00:19:48.897
turn to new perspectives
on slavery.

347
00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:53.485
What we've got here are
statistics about slavery.

348
00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.279
And I want you to talk about
what jumps out at you.

349
00:19:56.321 --> 00:19:57.781
[Student] It says about

350
00:19:57.822 --> 00:20:00.867
like one point one million
Southern white families owned no

351
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:04.204
slaves and that only
about three hundred and fifty

352
00:20:04.245 --> 00:20:06.081
a little over 350.000
owned slaves.

353
00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:07.499
That's only like a fourth or

354
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.959
fifth. which actually
a pretty crazy statistic.

355
00:20:10.001 --> 00:20:11.544
So a handful of people have.

356
00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:13.630
you know. one like five slaves
that probably was just around

357
00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:16.633
the household. which probably
were treated pretty well.

358
00:20:16.675 --> 00:20:18.009
[Instructor] Well. it depends.

359
00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:19.636
[Student] Of course. the
southerners were trying to.

360
00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.596
you know.
I mean. they weren't treated

361
00:20:21.638 --> 00:20:24.182
like regular humans.
but they they took care of them

362
00:20:24.224 --> 00:20:25.809
because they were like
a way to make money.

363
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.727
[Instructor] Correct.
It's an investment.

364
00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:29.688
That's my money.
I need to take care of my money.

365
00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:31.981
I want that to keep
producing more money for me.

366
00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:34.901
Therefore. I take care of it
and I don't take care of it

367
00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:38.780
and provide. I mean. it's still
a dirt floor they sleep on.

368
00:20:38.822 --> 00:20:41.116
You know. it's still I'm
working 10 to 12 hours.

369
00:20:41.157 --> 00:20:42.409
It's not.

370
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:46.079
Let's look at 210.
whippings per person.

371
00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.707
In the south.
where was the wealth?

372
00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:52.836
So owning land
and owning slaves?

373
00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:56.339
if I invested twenty three
thousand dollars in something.

374
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.883
I don't want to beat
it to a pulp.

375
00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:00.010
Right?

376
00:21:00.051 --> 00:21:01.928
So why do they do it?
[Student] Fear.

377
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.597
[Instructor] Fear. you hit
on it. That's the word.

378
00:21:04.639 --> 00:21:08.226
Here's what American slavery is
about. money and fear.

379
00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.061
They are making lots of money

380
00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:13.606
and they are terrified of what
happens if this goes away.

381
00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:15.066
What happens when people talk

382
00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:16.693
about abolition
and emancipation?

383
00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:20.030
What do I start
picturing in my head?

384
00:21:20.655 --> 00:21:23.533
[Student] Getting lynched?
[Instructor] Yes. retribution.

385
00:21:23.575 --> 00:21:25.493
They're going to come after us.

386
00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:26.661
So you could look at and say.

387
00:21:26.703 --> 00:21:29.956
you know. the situation's
not great. but

388
00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:31.499
I don't want to get lynched.

389
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.586
I don't like people throwing
rocks through my windows.

390
00:21:37.672 --> 00:21:39.799
(woman on tv) The violence.

391
00:21:39.841 --> 00:21:45.263
Police officers pointed guns
into crowds of young people.

392
00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:47.599
It was shocking to me.

393
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.353
Why are we still in a war in
this country over race?

394
00:21:51.394 --> 00:21:55.106
- Slavery?
- Slavery. It lasted 200 years.

395
00:21:55.148 --> 00:21:58.818
You have to develop a psychology
on the part of the white people

396
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.239
who are doing this that involves
enormous acts of denial.

397
00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:08.495
We haven't even claimed it as
the horrific system that it was.

398
00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:12.040
- She says slavery is the cause.

399
00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:16.336
And so many white people that we
hear say. don't talk to me about

400
00:22:16.378 --> 00:22:20.048
slavery. I didn't own slaves.
my parents didn't own slaves.

401
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:25.553
- The cultural conditioning that
began in slavery has continued.

402
00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:28.014
The privileges that you see some

403
00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:31.393
white people have
goes back to. I'm more than you.

404
00:22:31.434 --> 00:22:34.479
I'm better than you.
- Why? why? why?

405
00:22:34.521 --> 00:22:37.399
Why are they better?

406
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.817
- Oh. I don't believe it.
- I know it.

407
00:22:38.858 --> 00:22:40.985
but why do they
think they're better?

408
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.363
- Privilege.

409
00:22:43.405 --> 00:22:44.948
Privilege has told
them they're better.

410
00:22:44.989 --> 00:22:46.950
- I mean. they don't even
know that they're privileged.

411
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:48.660
I remember a book I read in
seminary.

412
00:22:48.702 --> 00:22:50.495
- Excuse me. I don't buy that.

413
00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:53.540
They don't
know they're privileged.

414
00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:55.083
- They have a

415
00:22:55.125 --> 00:23:00.630
well. no. I serve a congregation
of overeducated white people

416
00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:02.841
who don't recognize
their privilege.

417
00:23:02.882 --> 00:23:05.552
They don't see
that you start that.

418
00:23:05.593 --> 00:23:08.596
It's just the norm.
It's their norm.

419
00:23:08.638 --> 00:23:10.807
- If you don't feel that you
are privileged.

420
00:23:10.849 --> 00:23:15.562
how do you account
for the differences between

421
00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:18.231
white people and disadvantaged
black people?

422
00:23:18.273 --> 00:23:20.233
- They're not comparing
themselves to black people.

423
00:23:20.275 --> 00:23:23.111
Like my white friends are
mostly comparing themselves

424
00:23:23.153 --> 00:23:27.574
to other highly educated.
well-off white friends.

425
00:23:27.615 --> 00:23:31.494
- But when you say white people
can't get it. I don't.

426
00:23:31.536 --> 00:23:33.288
I don't buy it.

427
00:23:33.329 --> 00:23:34.497
- Well. I don't know why
they can't get.

428
00:23:34.539 --> 00:23:35.707
- I don't buy it for a moment.

429
00:23:35.749 --> 00:23:40.712
Since the 60s.
I have been proving myself.

430
00:23:40.754 --> 00:23:45.633
And there comes a point
in life when you say I'm done.

431
00:23:46.384 --> 00:23:50.013
It's on them now
because I know I'm Ok.

432
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.516
So the way I look
at it. is your loss.

433
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:57.687
I don't intend to spend all
of my life proving to white

434
00:23:57.729 --> 00:24:00.940
people that I'm Ok.
- Don't prove it

435
00:24:00.982 --> 00:24:03.485
just I think we've got to
educate.

436
00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:04.778
We got to educate them.
- No. we don't.

437
00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:06.112
- Well. I'm what I'm
saying is that

438
00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:09.824
there's nothing wrong with
having a conversation...

439
00:24:18.792 --> 00:24:20.335
[Instructor] Last night
I was at this dinner.

440
00:24:20.377 --> 00:24:22.003
it was this conversation about

441
00:24:22.045 --> 00:24:24.881
slavery being the source
of our racial problems.

442
00:24:24.923 --> 00:24:27.133
The topic of white
privilege came up a lot.

443
00:24:27.175 --> 00:24:28.760
You know. the idea of. you know.

444
00:24:28.802 --> 00:24:32.847
white people have
advantages in this country

445
00:24:32.889 --> 00:24:34.182
or.

446
00:24:34.224 --> 00:24:35.558
yeah. I mean. advantages.

447
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.936
Or you could flip it around.
say black people have

448
00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:42.524
disadvantages in this country
simply because of skin tone.

449
00:24:42.565 --> 00:24:44.150
[Student] I feel like it kind
of goes both ways.

450
00:24:44.192 --> 00:24:46.403
Sometimes white people
have a disadvantage.

451
00:24:46.444 --> 00:24:47.529
I had a friend
a couple of years ago.

452
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.323
his cumulative GPA was
like a 4.26

453
00:24:50.365 --> 00:24:52.784
and then he had a friend
that was black

454
00:24:52.826 --> 00:24:55.078
that had like a 3.9
like a 33.

455
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.162
And they both applied

456
00:24:56.204 --> 00:24:58.665
to Princeton
and the black kid got in.

457
00:24:58.707 --> 00:25:00.875
I feel like everyone says. well.
there's a lot of white

458
00:25:00.917 --> 00:25:04.170
privilege. so we have to give
other. like

459
00:25:04.212 --> 00:25:07.132
other ethnicities advantages
in this place instead of trying

460
00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:09.759
to view everyone as
just like an American.

461
00:25:09.801 --> 00:25:11.428
[Student] I mean. just
not talking about

462
00:25:11.469 --> 00:25:13.763
the race issue. just not

463
00:25:13.805 --> 00:25:18.393
bringing it up to the next
generation would

464
00:25:18.435 --> 00:25:22.522
keep them natural in that sense
and they would not be racist.

465
00:25:22.564 --> 00:25:24.274
- I don't
think that slavery

466
00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:27.694
and the Civil War and Jim Crow
should be forgotten.

467
00:25:27.736 --> 00:25:29.362
I think that they should be
remembered because I think

468
00:25:29.404 --> 00:25:32.699
they're an important lesson
that America isn't perfect

469
00:25:32.741 --> 00:25:35.994
and to. like. work against
that in the future.

470
00:25:36.036 --> 00:25:37.704
[Instructor] If you look
at things like

471
00:25:37.746 --> 00:25:40.040
the incarceration rate for.
you know.

472
00:25:40.081 --> 00:25:44.419
young black men in this country.
why it's so disproportional or

473
00:25:44.461 --> 00:25:48.173
why you have the socioeconomic
situations that you have

474
00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:50.717
between. say.
white people and black people.

475
00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:54.012
that you can see this
didn't come out of nowhere.

476
00:25:54.054 --> 00:25:57.432
This isn't a reflection of
the tone of somebody's skin.

477
00:25:57.474 --> 00:26:00.894
It's based in history that goes
back before your generation.

478
00:26:00.935 --> 00:26:03.521
before my generation.
before my grandparents.

479
00:26:03.563 --> 00:26:05.106
It goes way back.

480
00:26:05.148 --> 00:26:06.399
[Student] I think
there's a balance

481
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:08.318
between recognizing our past.

482
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.113
but also not over talking it
and just overemphasizing

483
00:26:12.155 --> 00:26:14.032
the problem to where it's
always on our minds.

484
00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:18.370
And then it's difficult to be
very equal when that's something

485
00:26:18.411 --> 00:26:22.791
that's always on your mind.
is racism and things like that.

486
00:26:29.631 --> 00:26:32.634
(somber music)

487
00:26:33.301 --> 00:26:34.844
- So please welcome

488
00:26:34.886 --> 00:26:36.971
Dr. Kelly Carter Jackson.

489
00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:38.390
(applause)

490
00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:40.767
[Kelly] So first off.
I want to tell you

491
00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:43.353
a story about one
of my students.

492
00:26:43.395 --> 00:26:48.441
he raised his hand and he said.
who is Harriet Tubman?

493
00:26:48.483 --> 00:26:52.112
I was like. oh. my God.
I tried really hard. you know.

494
00:26:52.153 --> 00:26:53.905
to sort of like as a professor.
you have to. like.

495
00:26:53.947 --> 00:26:56.783
fix your face before I
could answer the question.

496
00:26:56.825 --> 00:26:59.703
He goes. oh. I remember.

497
00:26:59.744 --> 00:27:01.913
She's the woman who wouldn't
get off the bus.

498
00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:05.500
And I was like. no. no.
that's not her at all.

499
00:27:05.542 --> 00:27:06.918
But it's important because I

500
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.963
think it highlights the fact
that we only see. like.

501
00:27:10.005 --> 00:27:13.967
one great black man and one
great black woman per century.

502
00:27:14.009 --> 00:27:16.386
So. Force and Freedom.
my book really tries

503
00:27:16.428 --> 00:27:20.306
to introduce new voices and
to highlight black abolitionist

504
00:27:20.348 --> 00:27:21.599
in particular.

505
00:27:21.641 --> 00:27:24.185
The moment the first black
person is enslaved.

506
00:27:24.227 --> 00:27:27.230
they're pushing back. They're
collecting arms as much as they

507
00:27:27.272 --> 00:27:31.317
possibly can to prepare for what
they believe is inevitable.

508
00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:34.237
and that is the violent
overthrow of slavery.

509
00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:37.741
- There seems to be a kind
of particular resistance

510
00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:42.954
to teaching this aspect
of American history.

511
00:27:42.996 --> 00:27:45.123
And. look and I think.
you know. I'm also a historian

512
00:27:45.165 --> 00:27:47.834
I can understand.
I can dissipate why.

513
00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:51.171
But I just want to get
you to talk about

514
00:27:51.212 --> 00:27:52.714
it takes your book

515
00:27:52.756 --> 00:27:56.551
to underscore force
as well as freedom.

516
00:27:56.593 --> 00:27:58.011
You know.
and we all know that that's

517
00:27:58.053 --> 00:28:00.972
a part of this history. but it's
not taught that way.

518
00:28:01.014 --> 00:28:02.682
[Kelly] It's not taught.
I think.

519
00:28:02.724 --> 00:28:07.687
because we have this
hypocritical. I think.

520
00:28:07.729 --> 00:28:09.939
hypocritical love
affair with violence.

521
00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:14.527
We talk about violence. I think.
in these really romantic ways.

522
00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:17.989
But that's only when we're
talking about white men.

523
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:20.283
When the situation is reversed.

524
00:28:20.325 --> 00:28:25.246
it is terrifying to think
of black people using force or

525
00:28:25.288 --> 00:28:27.457
using violence to bring
about their freedom.

526
00:28:33.254 --> 00:28:36.049
(crew chatter)

527
00:28:36.091 --> 00:28:37.342
[Director] so I want
to talk to you about

528
00:28:37.384 --> 00:28:40.470
what you've learned so far.
right. in college.

529
00:28:40.512 --> 00:28:41.846
Is there anything you've learned

530
00:28:41.888 --> 00:28:44.057
here about the story
of the civil war that would be

531
00:28:44.099 --> 00:28:46.309
hard to talk about
with people back home?

532
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:48.937
[Student] Yeah. my
daddy is that typical

533
00:28:48.978 --> 00:28:51.147
Southern male.
a lot of he knows

534
00:28:51.189 --> 00:28:53.900
everything and you
don't question him.

535
00:28:53.942 --> 00:28:56.069
And. you know.
I love him to death.

536
00:28:56.111 --> 00:28:57.195
That's just the way he

537
00:28:57.237 --> 00:28:58.530
is. that's the way people
are down here.

538
00:28:58.571 --> 00:29:00.615
If I told him that the main

539
00:29:00.657 --> 00:29:05.870
cause of the Civil War was
slavery and he would probably

540
00:29:06.538 --> 00:29:09.040
like open the Bible and start

541
00:29:09.082 --> 00:29:12.752
preaching at me and stuff
like that. I don't know.

542
00:29:12.794 --> 00:29:14.754
[Director] How would he
find that offensive?

543
00:29:14.796 --> 00:29:16.715
Well. my

544
00:29:16.756 --> 00:29:18.174
great great grandfather did

545
00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:21.928
fight in the Civil War
and he did come back like he

546
00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.722
didn't die or anything.
He came back alive.

547
00:29:23.763 --> 00:29:25.015
But it may set him up so bad.

548
00:29:25.056 --> 00:29:26.558
And it was a bad situation

549
00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:29.769
for my family at the time that
I would not know near enough

550
00:29:29.811 --> 00:29:32.772
about to really like
be able to give details.

551
00:29:32.814 --> 00:29:34.190
But

552
00:29:34.232 --> 00:29:38.236
it's just like a remembrance
of how hard times were

553
00:29:38.278 --> 00:29:40.530
at that time.
because it was really hard

554
00:29:40.572 --> 00:29:45.577
for my family because we're
born and raised in Pontotoc.
Mississippi.

555
00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:48.455
And like in my grandparents

556
00:29:48.496 --> 00:29:52.208
house. there's a no telling
how old rebel

557
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.628
flag like in one of those
flag boxes like this.

558
00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:58.631
And we don't.
you know. take it out.

559
00:29:58.673 --> 00:29:59.966
We don't rub it
in people's noses.

560
00:30:00.008 --> 00:30:03.011
It's just. you know.
up there above a cabinet.

561
00:30:06.806 --> 00:30:09.267
(Rhythmic drum music)

562
00:30:16.191 --> 00:30:18.151
- It has been called the war

563
00:30:18.193 --> 00:30:21.571
brother against brother.
the Civil War

564
00:30:21.613 --> 00:30:25.241
soldier and nation together
found that their fears

565
00:30:25.283 --> 00:30:28.620
and doubts were not so
strong as their faith.

566
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:30.830
And in national shrines like

567
00:30:30.872 --> 00:30:33.667
Gettysburg.
we memorialize the men of both

568
00:30:33.708 --> 00:30:37.337
sides who gave of themselves
unreservedly for what they

569
00:30:37.379 --> 00:30:42.509
believe to be right.
Remember and be proud.

570
00:30:47.347 --> 00:30:51.184
[Dr. Blight] We've never really
had a racial reckoning.

571
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:56.356
The problem started first
immediately after the war.

572
00:30:56.398 --> 00:30:59.609
if you want north and south
to get together and get along

573
00:30:59.651 --> 00:31:03.196
again. you don't talk about
causes and consequences.

574
00:31:03.238 --> 00:31:07.117
You talk about the mutual
valor on that battlefield.

575
00:31:11.329 --> 00:31:13.623
(somber music)

576
00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:21.214
Why doesn't that Confederacy.

577
00:31:21.256 --> 00:31:24.300
which only lasted four
years. just go away?

578
00:31:24.342 --> 00:31:27.470
The racial reasons are
paramount. but it also has to do

579
00:31:27.512 --> 00:31:31.891
with this idea that the
Confederacy was a decent.

580
00:31:31.933 --> 00:31:33.435
Man. they went to the limit and

581
00:31:33.476 --> 00:31:37.022
they deserved respect
for all that courage.

582
00:31:38.273 --> 00:31:41.234
They claim after they've lost
that they were only reacting

583
00:31:41.276 --> 00:31:45.071
to the overreach
of centralized federal power.

584
00:31:46.364 --> 00:31:50.493
And there's a kind of admiration
for that still in our culture.

585
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:57.375
(upbeat music)

586
00:32:05.008 --> 00:32:09.137
- James McGill.
he settled this farm almost 200

587
00:32:09.179 --> 00:32:13.141
years ago. and I felt like I've
followed in his footsteps.

588
00:32:13.183 --> 00:32:16.519
My wife raised the children.

589
00:32:16.561 --> 00:32:18.438
All I ever did was work.

590
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.440
Of course. now. federal
government took my farm.

591
00:32:20.482 --> 00:32:21.649
So

592
00:32:22.067 --> 00:32:24.110
so I had it financed

593
00:32:24.152 --> 00:32:26.905
with federal government.
farmers. home administration.

594
00:32:26.946 --> 00:32:28.782
They wouldn't redo my loans.

595
00:32:28.823 --> 00:32:30.784
During the war
and reconstruction.

596
00:32:30.825 --> 00:32:32.786
People in the South
lost everything.

597
00:32:32.827 --> 00:32:35.455
Well. I can empathize with them.

598
00:32:35.497 --> 00:32:38.541
It made me mad and I couldn't
understand why they were mad.

599
00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:41.252
And they and they spent 150
years and them

600
00:32:41.294 --> 00:32:44.005
people are still mad
in the south about it.

601
00:32:44.047 --> 00:32:47.634
It's wrong for the federal
government to dictate

602
00:32:47.676 --> 00:32:50.720
to the states what they
should or should not do.

603
00:32:50.762 --> 00:32:55.475
And ever since the war. no
one's property has been secure.

604
00:32:55.517 --> 00:32:59.229
And there's a lot of talk
of reparations for slaves.

605
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.983
You know. my great great
grandfather. nobody paid

606
00:33:04.025 --> 00:33:06.194
Abraham Lincoln.
emancipated the slaves.

607
00:33:06.236 --> 00:33:08.113
He didn't get paid for it.

608
00:33:08.154 --> 00:33:10.407
The war to prevent southern

609
00:33:10.448 --> 00:33:14.828
independence changed our
country for the worse.

610
00:33:15.412 --> 00:33:18.289
In my opinion.
- And what do you think?

611
00:33:18.331 --> 00:33:20.458
Do you think the war changed
the country for the worse?

612
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.336
- I'm trying to process
everything.

613
00:33:24.671 --> 00:33:27.215
I do understand

614
00:33:28.508 --> 00:33:32.303
parts of what my father's
speaking on because I feel

615
00:33:32.345 --> 00:33:37.726
that way. that the government is
too big and has too much power.

616
00:33:37.767 --> 00:33:39.019
It's an invasion.

617
00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.689
But how long would it take
to free the slaves?

618
00:33:42.731 --> 00:33:44.649
How long would it have taken

619
00:33:44.691 --> 00:33:48.028
for them to realize
that slavery is wrong?

620
00:33:48.069 --> 00:33:49.320
[Director] Do you
think slavery left

621
00:33:49.362 --> 00:33:52.198
an imprint on the mindset
of people in America?

622
00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.994
- Sure.
It left an imprint. but

623
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:58.872
I'm saying the war left
more of an imprint.

624
00:33:58.913 --> 00:34:02.042
That's my personal opinion.
[Director] For black and white?

625
00:34:02.083 --> 00:34:03.251
- Yes.

626
00:34:03.293 --> 00:34:04.961
[Director] So you feel
like the war itself

627
00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:07.047
was a bigger aggression
than slavery?

628
00:34:07.088 --> 00:34:08.298
- Yes.

629
00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.467
[Director] It feels like
you're dismissing

630
00:34:10.508 --> 00:34:13.511
the experience of millions
of enslaved people.

631
00:34:14.471 --> 00:34:18.016
It feels like you're
not seeing what they

632
00:34:18.058 --> 00:34:23.355
experienced at the hands of the
people who were enslaving them.

633
00:34:23.813 --> 00:34:25.899
I mean. how is treating people

634
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.069
as property not
a greater horror?

635
00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.279
- Well. my feeling was
that it was legal.

636
00:34:31.321 --> 00:34:35.909
It was a settled way of or they
had laws that they

637
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:42.123
had to live up to and forced
on them and treat them like

638
00:34:42.165 --> 00:34:46.628
civilly.
I don't hate James McGill.

639
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:49.756
I just want our schools
and universities to stop

640
00:34:49.798 --> 00:34:53.218
teaching our children to hate
our southern ancestors.

641
00:34:53.259 --> 00:34:55.220
They don't deserve that.

642
00:35:00.308 --> 00:35:03.311
(ominous music)

643
00:35:08.942 --> 00:35:11.319
[Director] Do you know what
the Confederate flag looks like?

644
00:35:11.361 --> 00:35:14.656
[Student] Yes. it has a cross
and it's red. white and blue

645
00:35:14.698 --> 00:35:17.158
with stars going
through the cross.

646
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.119
[Director] Where have you
seen that flag?

647
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.621
- I see it
when I'm driving.

648
00:35:21.663 --> 00:35:25.333
when I'm traveling.
I see at. where I live.

649
00:35:25.375 --> 00:35:28.294
I live in the countryside.
and the countryside

650
00:35:28.336 --> 00:35:29.838
I travel to Greenwood and it's

651
00:35:29.879 --> 00:35:32.966
white people back
there. there's no black people.

652
00:35:33.008 --> 00:35:34.467
And I see a lot of Confederate

653
00:35:34.509 --> 00:35:37.262
flags that hang out the houses
to hang out the mailboxes.

654
00:35:37.303 --> 00:35:39.556
I see it on the back
of people trucks.

655
00:35:39.597 --> 00:35:41.433
[Director] And what does
it make you think?

656
00:35:43.018 --> 00:35:44.561
- Grow up.

657
00:35:46.062 --> 00:35:47.647
Basically.

658
00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:49.816
[Director] In class. you said
you were a good public speaker.

659
00:35:49.858 --> 00:35:51.568
- Yes. I am.

660
00:35:51.609 --> 00:35:53.570
[Director] What makes
you a good speaker?

661
00:35:53.611 --> 00:35:56.322
- My projection.
my performance.

662
00:35:56.364 --> 00:35:59.284
When I speak.
I capture your attention.

663
00:35:59.325 --> 00:36:01.286
I know that I capture attention.

664
00:36:01.327 --> 00:36:05.040
I do oratoricals. I've
won first place in

665
00:36:05.749 --> 00:36:08.293
five. six oratoriclas. That's
all of them I

666
00:36:08.335 --> 00:36:12.297
competed in and I won
second place once.

667
00:36:13.256 --> 00:36:14.674
[Director] I hadn't
noticed any white kids

668
00:36:14.716 --> 00:36:16.676
at the school. are there any
white kids at this school?

669
00:36:16.718 --> 00:36:19.304
- No.
[Director] Why is that?

670
00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:23.350
- I would say.
in my personal opinion.

671
00:36:23.391 --> 00:36:26.978
I don't know if this why.
but I will simply say

672
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:31.858
the fact of segregation like is.
is how we are here. like.

673
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.736
It just socially happened like
this is the black kids school.

674
00:36:34.778 --> 00:36:37.697
Central Holmes is the
white kids school.

675
00:36:37.739 --> 00:36:40.283
that's just how
the neighborhood.

676
00:36:40.325 --> 00:36:42.702
that's how the parents
separated everything.

677
00:36:42.744 --> 00:36:45.955
[Director] Have you ever had
a white friend?

678
00:36:45.997 --> 00:36:47.540
- No.

679
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:52.504
No. I've never. I've never.

680
00:36:53.713 --> 00:36:56.049
Been around a white person
long enough. I've never had

681
00:36:56.091 --> 00:37:01.388
a complete conversation
to even become associates.

682
00:37:01.429 --> 00:37:02.639
[Director] Do you
think that the civil

683
00:37:02.681 --> 00:37:04.265
war was relevant to your life?

684
00:37:04.307 --> 00:37:06.101
- I feel that
it's relevant because

685
00:37:06.142 --> 00:37:09.688
your past. your
history is your story.

686
00:37:10.438 --> 00:37:13.817
Whether or not you know or
not. it's your story.

687
00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:18.571
(children chatter)

688
00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.914
(dramatic music)

689
00:37:38.425 --> 00:37:41.469
- These are the 209.145
African Americans

690
00:37:41.511 --> 00:37:44.097
in the union army.
that fought in the Civil War.

691
00:37:44.139 --> 00:37:47.434
They served in every branch
in the Army. 142 Color

692
00:37:47.475 --> 00:37:50.061
Infantry Regiments.
7 Color Calvary Regiments.

693
00:37:50.103 --> 00:37:53.523
13 Color Artillery Regiments.
and it's color pioneer
regiments.

694
00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:56.484
They looked at each as family
because if you serving

695
00:37:56.526 --> 00:38:00.780
for three years. all you
have is your comrades.

696
00:38:00.822 --> 00:38:02.115
(marching count)

697
00:38:02.157 --> 00:38:04.200
- your left. your left. right.

698
00:38:04.242 --> 00:38:07.120
Who's on your left.

699
00:38:07.162 --> 00:38:08.580
Your left.

700
00:38:09.414 --> 00:38:13.668
your left. your left. right.
Your left.

701
00:38:15.086 --> 00:38:16.504
your left.

702
00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.884
your left. your left. your left.
right.

703
00:38:22.427 --> 00:38:24.012
Company. halt.

704
00:38:24.054 --> 00:38:26.556
So this is the African-American
Civil War Museum.

705
00:38:26.598 --> 00:38:27.932
The monument and museum

706
00:38:27.974 --> 00:38:31.102
were built to correct
a great wrong in history.

707
00:38:31.144 --> 00:38:32.854
America has wrote
a history about

708
00:38:32.896 --> 00:38:36.900
that whole conflict that did not
include African-Americans

709
00:38:36.941 --> 00:38:39.361
and these African-American
soldiers and their great role

710
00:38:39.402 --> 00:38:42.822
in ending that war
to preserve the nation

711
00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:44.783
and enslavement here
in the United States.

712
00:38:44.824 --> 00:38:46.659
The war started.
but for two years.

713
00:38:46.701 --> 00:38:48.661
President Lincoln wouldn't
let blacks join the army.

714
00:38:48.703 --> 00:38:51.623
Well. once he realized he
couldn't win this war without us

715
00:38:51.664 --> 00:38:54.668
then the war starts to change
in Lincoln's favor.

716
00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:58.254
150.000. they were enslaved.
living in those southern states.

717
00:38:58.296 --> 00:38:59.631
They literally end up

718
00:38:59.673 --> 00:39:01.841
with uniforms on and rifles
in their pockets.

719
00:39:01.883 --> 00:39:03.760
So if you're thinking
to yourself. I live in a world

720
00:39:03.802 --> 00:39:05.512
that's out of control
and there's nothing I can do

721
00:39:05.553 --> 00:39:08.098
about it. Well. there is
something you can do about it
and you can

722
00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:10.850
take lessons from these people
whose stories we tell here

723
00:39:10.892 --> 00:39:14.604
in this museum.
I think it's liberating.

724
00:39:17.565 --> 00:39:19.192
[Director] We're making
this film about how

725
00:39:19.234 --> 00:39:20.860
we tell the story
of the Civil War.

726
00:39:20.902 --> 00:39:23.029
And I think you guys just
finished that unit. right?

727
00:39:23.071 --> 00:39:24.114
[Student] yeah.

728
00:39:24.155 --> 00:39:25.740
[Director] What did you think?

729
00:39:25.782 --> 00:39:27.784
[Student] You know. I feel like
it's living in this country is

730
00:39:27.826 --> 00:39:29.828
like. oh. the civil war.
you know about it.

731
00:39:29.869 --> 00:39:34.874
But when you start to learn
about it. there's so many. like.

732
00:39:36.334 --> 00:39:39.212
intricate details
of why things happened.

733
00:39:39.254 --> 00:39:43.091
And I think it's important
that we learn about it.

734
00:39:43.133 --> 00:39:45.093
But the one thing that

735
00:39:45.135 --> 00:39:46.970
does.

736
00:39:47.012 --> 00:39:49.431
like. not concern me. but

737
00:39:50.432 --> 00:39:51.933
most people here have the same

738
00:39:51.975 --> 00:39:55.562
kinds of political views which.
you know. it's great to be

739
00:39:55.603 --> 00:39:57.731
around people
who think like you.

740
00:39:57.772 --> 00:40:02.318
But at the same time. there's
no. like. real conversation.

741
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.820
There's no real dialog

742
00:40:03.862 --> 00:40:07.032
and understanding like
people who have different views

743
00:40:07.073 --> 00:40:10.326
than you. which is. I think.
how we can move forward.

744
00:40:10.368 --> 00:40:14.039
Um. I think that's important.
- And in order for people

745
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.666
to really get your perspective
and understand where you're

746
00:40:16.708 --> 00:40:20.086
coming from. what's one thing
they should know about you?

747
00:40:20.128 --> 00:40:21.546
- Right.

748
00:40:22.464 --> 00:40:24.132
I mean.

749
00:40:24.716 --> 00:40:26.593
the biggest thing
for me is gender.

750
00:40:26.634 --> 00:40:32.182
I try to present as
masculinely as I can. but.

751
00:40:32.849 --> 00:40:37.354
you know. people still sometimes

752
00:40:37.395 --> 00:40:41.900
take me for a girl and that's
like the biggest thing that's

753
00:40:41.941 --> 00:40:45.028
kind of hard for me
to deal with.

754
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.662
Yeah. that's probably the big
that's the biggest one.

755
00:40:54.704 --> 00:40:58.124
[Director] It's like you're not
getting fully seen.

756
00:40:58.166 --> 00:40:59.834
- Right. yeah.

757
00:41:08.927 --> 00:41:10.804
[Dr. Blight] Reconstruction has
been the most

758
00:41:10.845 --> 00:41:15.183
contested question in America's
historical memory.

759
00:41:15.225 --> 00:41:17.018
Reconstruction is a period

760
00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:20.730
of time that begins immediately
after the war.

761
00:41:20.772 --> 00:41:26.528
a 10 to 12 year era when America
had to truly reinvent itself.

762
00:41:28.363 --> 00:41:30.115
Fourteenth Amendment puts equal

763
00:41:30.156 --> 00:41:34.119
protection of the law
into the U.S. Constitution.

764
00:41:35.537 --> 00:41:39.958
And the right to vote for black
men in the 15th Amendment was

765
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.711
a constitutional and legal
revolution.

766
00:41:42.752 --> 00:41:45.547
and some black spokesmen
by the 1890s and the turn

767
00:41:45.588 --> 00:41:51.094
of the 20th century would often
refer to 1865 as the year zero

768
00:41:51.136 --> 00:41:55.223
of a new calendar. a new
beginning to history itself.

769
00:42:00.353 --> 00:42:02.188
But you have to incorporate

770
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:06.568
the white south
into an American union.

771
00:42:06.609 --> 00:42:10.113
a society
that had just lost approximately

772
00:42:10.155 --> 00:42:15.285
18 percent of its adult
male population in war.

773
00:42:17.412 --> 00:42:21.249
How do you reunify those people

774
00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:26.254
at the emotional level with
the side that is the victor?

775
00:42:34.012 --> 00:42:36.723
- We're having our monthly
Civil War roundtable.

776
00:42:36.765 --> 00:42:39.059
we call ourselves the
East Bridgewater Civil War

777
00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:43.146
Roundtable. named after a town.
- We sent 300 men from this
town.

778
00:42:43.188 --> 00:42:46.900
- I think it was four.
- Closer to 400.

779
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:49.778
- 50 of them died. The basis
of our meeting tonight.

780
00:42:49.819 --> 00:42:51.613
We call it reconstruction.

781
00:42:51.654 --> 00:42:54.199
You know. what went right
and what went wrong.

782
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.700
All right.

783
00:42:55.742 --> 00:42:57.494
Holy mackerel.
Hello.

784
00:42:57.535 --> 00:42:59.579
Hello.
What a crowd.

785
00:42:59.621 --> 00:43:01.748
We're going to talk about
reconstruction.

786
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:07.921
the physical period of time
from from 1865 to 1877.

787
00:43:07.962 --> 00:43:10.882
You know. in the school system.
we came to reconstruction

788
00:43:10.924 --> 00:43:13.176
and the chapter ended
on the Civil War.

789
00:43:13.218 --> 00:43:16.221
- How are you going to rebuild
this part of the country

790
00:43:16.262 --> 00:43:20.433
with malice towards...
as Lincoln's words.

791
00:43:20.475 --> 00:43:22.018
How are you going to do that?

792
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:25.855
- No one on the civilian side
on the Confederate presidency

793
00:43:25.897 --> 00:43:30.276
was ever forced to concede and
repudiate what they believed.

794
00:43:30.318 --> 00:43:34.239
And we allowed a group of people
that waged an armed insurrection

795
00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.368
against their government to
build statues to their heroes.

796
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.245
So that has kept it alive.

797
00:43:40.286 --> 00:43:43.915
We have never solved the core
problem. the civil war.

798
00:43:43.957 --> 00:43:46.042
And that's why reconstruction
didn't have a chance. The north

799
00:43:46.084 --> 00:43:47.711
was fighting back
and forth during

800
00:43:47.752 --> 00:43:49.004
the whole reconstruction period.

801
00:43:49.045 --> 00:43:50.714
And let's not forget
the elephant in the middle

802
00:43:50.755 --> 00:43:55.969
of the room. north and south
were racists. period.

803
00:43:56.011 --> 00:44:00.098
The black was not considered
to be a human being.

804
00:44:01.182 --> 00:44:02.517
- How are ya?

805
00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:03.518
[Director] Excuse me. I have a
question.

806
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.728
Have you ever had

807
00:44:04.769 --> 00:44:06.438
an African-American
member in this group?

808
00:44:06.479 --> 00:44:07.897
Because it struck me

809
00:44:07.939 --> 00:44:10.900
in the conversation about
race that everyone was white.

810
00:44:10.942 --> 00:44:13.194
- No. we haven't.
- Have you looked at

811
00:44:13.236 --> 00:44:17.407
the demographic of east
Bridgewater and the area?

812
00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:21.077
- Where in the 90s.

813
00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:24.664
which is well.
which is an odd thing because we

814
00:44:24.706 --> 00:44:29.753
live. we border Brockton.
which is predominantly

815
00:44:29.794 --> 00:44:33.173
minorities. which are
really the majorities now.

816
00:44:33.214 --> 00:44:36.009
I mean. how do you reach
out to say that they're welcome?

817
00:44:36.051 --> 00:44:37.510
Well. I mean. they're welcome.
but how do you

818
00:44:37.552 --> 00:44:39.846
make them feel that
they're welcome?

819
00:44:39.888 --> 00:44:42.766
I mean. here I think we'd
make them feel welcomed.

820
00:44:42.807 --> 00:44:44.142
How do you how do you do that?

821
00:44:44.184 --> 00:44:47.103
I mean. yeah.
that's a good question.

822
00:44:47.145 --> 00:44:48.688
I'll have to think about that.

823
00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:51.274
The same question is why we live
right next to Brockton and we

824
00:44:51.316 --> 00:44:53.318
don't have a large
population of blacks.

825
00:44:54.527 --> 00:44:57.364
- I live in the town of Kingston
and there's not a large

826
00:44:57.405 --> 00:44:59.657
population of blacks
in the town of Kingston.

827
00:44:59.699 --> 00:45:01.201
You know.

828
00:45:01.242 --> 00:45:03.203
the Silverlake Regional High
School is the fourth or fifth

829
00:45:03.244 --> 00:45:08.041
largest diversified high school
with. you know. 1500 kids in it.

830
00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:09.876
I mean. there are
a few families.

831
00:45:09.918 --> 00:45:13.296
But why? Yet.
you go into Brockton

832
00:45:13.338 --> 00:45:16.841
or you go into New Bedford or
Fall River. the cities.

833
00:45:16.883 --> 00:45:19.886
you tend to find a larger
minority community.

834
00:45:19.928 --> 00:45:21.638
Is it because those minorities

835
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.891
feel more comfortable there?
You know?

836
00:45:24.933 --> 00:45:25.934
I don't know.

837
00:45:25.975 --> 00:45:28.061
I don't have the answers.

838
00:45:41.866 --> 00:45:47.455
* Facing the rising sun *

839
00:45:47.497 --> 00:45:52.335
* of our new day begun *

840
00:45:52.377 --> 00:46:02.262
* let's us march on
til victory is won *

841
00:46:02.595 --> 00:46:03.972
Woo!

842
00:46:04.014 --> 00:46:06.182
[Greg] At the end it says
shadow beneath our hand

843
00:46:06.224 --> 00:46:09.602
may be forever stand.
true to our God.

844
00:46:09.644 --> 00:46:12.981
true to our native land.

845
00:46:13.023 --> 00:46:15.233
See. these guys were tricky.
By native land

846
00:46:15.275 --> 00:46:17.360
what were they talking about?
[Student] Us.

847
00:46:17.402 --> 00:46:19.279
[Greg] Us. our land?

848
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.823
Meaning what? What does
us mean to you?

849
00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:23.742
What was reconstruction?

850
00:46:23.783 --> 00:46:28.121
When was it? After slavery.
Yes.

851
00:46:28.163 --> 00:46:30.957
- After the Civil War.
- After the Civil War.

852
00:46:30.999 --> 00:46:33.251
This was when
black people tried to teach

853
00:46:33.293 --> 00:46:35.962
America how to have a real
democracy during reconstruction.

854
00:46:36.004 --> 00:46:38.673
black people were able to vote
in the South and they got

855
00:46:38.715 --> 00:46:41.801
in the state legislators
and passed laws

856
00:46:41.843 --> 00:46:44.679
to say things like. everybody
should go to school for free.

857
00:46:44.721 --> 00:46:45.889
And they say white people too?

858
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.849
Yeah. white people.
you poor white people.

859
00:46:47.891 --> 00:46:49.309
This man right here.

860
00:46:49.351 --> 00:46:51.394
John Mercer Langston. came
out of slavery in Virginia.

861
00:46:51.436 --> 00:46:55.065
He came to D.C.
as a congressman from Virginia.

862
00:46:55.106 --> 00:46:57.317
This man was born into slavery.

863
00:46:57.359 --> 00:47:00.320
You know. he's crazy.
I got seen. no problem. I'll

864
00:47:00.362 --> 00:47:03.073
be back. You know. I mean.
it's Congressman Langston now.

865
00:47:03.114 --> 00:47:04.949
That's why I love
reconstruction.

866
00:47:04.991 --> 00:47:06.451
You had real heroes.

867
00:47:06.493 --> 00:47:09.329
Are we any different
than these people were?

868
00:47:09.371 --> 00:47:11.164
No. we're not.
You know the difference?

869
00:47:11.206 --> 00:47:12.999
We just don't remember.

870
00:47:13.041 --> 00:47:15.502
My name is Greg Carr and I'm

871
00:47:15.543 --> 00:47:17.462
an associate professor and chair
of the Department

872
00:47:17.504 --> 00:47:20.423
of Afro-American Studies
here at Howard University.

873
00:47:20.465 --> 00:47:22.717
[Director] And what connection
do you have to the history.

874
00:47:22.759 --> 00:47:25.512
to the history of the civil
war and reconstruction?

875
00:47:25.553 --> 00:47:26.888
[Greg] Well.

876
00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:29.432
in addition to the direct
history. my ancestors have

877
00:47:29.474 --> 00:47:32.977
been brought here from
North Carolina and Alabama.

878
00:47:33.019 --> 00:47:35.063
No civil war veterans

879
00:47:35.105 --> 00:47:38.858
in my direct family. but we
were enslaved in Alabama.

880
00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.028
So obviously coming
out of civil war.

881
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.031
my family
sharecroppers come in the areas

882
00:47:45.073 --> 00:47:48.702
of Jim Crow. Great Migration
moving throughout the south.

883
00:47:48.743 --> 00:47:51.871
You know. I'm a living part
of that stream of history.

884
00:47:51.913 --> 00:47:54.541
And as a professor here
at Howard University

885
00:47:54.582 --> 00:47:56.835
and particularly in Africana
studies. which is my field

886
00:47:56.876 --> 00:48:01.297
of study in the area I work in.
devote a great part of my work

887
00:48:01.339 --> 00:48:03.508
to understanding
the implications of the civil

888
00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:07.053
war and reconstruction in terms
of contemporary American life.

889
00:48:07.095 --> 00:48:08.972
What's this right here?

890
00:48:09.014 --> 00:48:10.849
[Students] Deed of sale.

891
00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:12.142
[Greg] Deed of sale.

892
00:48:12.183 --> 00:48:14.227
These are reconstruction
era documents.

893
00:48:14.269 --> 00:48:16.563
Most people in the country
don't know anything about that.

894
00:48:16.604 --> 00:48:18.064
So you can say. oh.

895
00:48:18.106 --> 00:48:20.108
we saw the charter. we saw
the deed of sale for the land.

896
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:21.609
[Director] You know.

897
00:48:21.651 --> 00:48:24.237
you're the only teacher I filmed
who's focused on the freed

898
00:48:24.279 --> 00:48:27.574
people's point of view when
teaching reconstruction.

899
00:48:27.615 --> 00:48:29.159
How does teaching

900
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.036
from that point of view make
a difference for your students?

901
00:48:31.077 --> 00:48:32.746
[Greg] What I hope
they will walk out

902
00:48:32.787 --> 00:48:37.917
with a sense of human purpose
that they have a stake in.

903
00:48:37.959 --> 00:48:39.169
There's always the threat

904
00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.547
of forgetting in terms
of national memory.

905
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:44.758
When you start talking about
a settler state like

906
00:48:44.799 --> 00:48:47.385
the United States that came out
of a settler colony with many

907
00:48:47.427 --> 00:48:50.263
different people.
there's almost a required

908
00:48:50.305 --> 00:48:53.391
forgetting of violence.
of forgetting in order to force

909
00:48:53.433 --> 00:48:58.313
a type of unity of culture.
the unity of national identity.

910
00:48:58.355 --> 00:48:59.439
So the work that remains to be

911
00:48:59.481 --> 00:49:02.609
done is to recognize
our full history.

912
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:05.195
That story will make you
so proud of black people.

913
00:49:05.236 --> 00:49:07.072
Also. break your heart.

914
00:49:15.747 --> 00:49:18.416
(slow music)

915
00:49:37.977 --> 00:49:40.271
- My name is Brother Rogers.
I work at the

916
00:49:40.313 --> 00:49:42.774
Mississippi Department
of Archives and History.

917
00:49:42.816 --> 00:49:44.275
I created a website

918
00:49:44.317 --> 00:49:46.861
with a picture of every
historical marker in the state.

919
00:49:46.903 --> 00:49:48.029
[Director] Have you taken a

920
00:49:48.071 --> 00:49:49.489
picture of the Clinton
riots marker?

921
00:49:49.531 --> 00:49:51.157
[Rogers] I have taken a picture
of that marker.

922
00:49:51.199 --> 00:49:54.202
I know exactly where it is
near the railroad track

923
00:49:54.244 --> 00:49:55.537
in Clinton.
[Director] That's right.

924
00:49:55.578 --> 00:49:56.830
And what do you think?

925
00:49:56.871 --> 00:49:58.039
Tell me what you're. tell me

926
00:49:58.081 --> 00:49:59.749
what do you know
about that marker?

927
00:49:59.791 --> 00:50:01.584
- Well. I
think that the Clinton

928
00:50:01.626 --> 00:50:05.338
riot marker is particularly
important because there was

929
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:09.467
a riot during reconstruction
in the town of Clinton.

930
00:50:09.509 --> 00:50:13.596
That was not in the history
books that I read growing up

931
00:50:13.638 --> 00:50:16.641
studying Mississippi history
and the local public schools.

932
00:50:16.683 --> 00:50:20.812
Reconstruction in America.
not just in Mississippi.

933
00:50:20.854 --> 00:50:25.191
is one of the most overlooked
and underappreciated historical

934
00:50:25.233 --> 00:50:27.193
eras. And the people
who wrote about it

935
00:50:27.235 --> 00:50:31.406
afterwards. North and South
wrote about it mainly

936
00:50:31.448 --> 00:50:34.534
from a white supremacy point
of view. whether they were in

937
00:50:34.576 --> 00:50:37.579
Ohio and Michigan or
Alabama or Mississippi.

938
00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.457
There was lots of violence
throughout America.

939
00:50:40.498 --> 00:50:43.376
during reconstruction
against African-Americans.

940
00:50:43.418 --> 00:50:46.963
It's a terrible time in our
history from that perspective.

941
00:50:47.005 --> 00:50:48.173
It's a great time again

942
00:50:48.214 --> 00:50:50.884
of experimentation
with providing the rights

943
00:50:50.925 --> 00:50:54.471
of citizenship and political
equality to African-Americans.

944
00:50:54.512 --> 00:50:55.805
Unfortunately. through the lens

945
00:50:55.847 --> 00:50:58.224
of white supremacy.
that was too much for a lot

946
00:50:58.266 --> 00:51:00.310
of white people to take
during that time.

947
00:51:00.352 --> 00:51:02.562
[Director] Are there
any other markers

948
00:51:02.604 --> 00:51:04.981
in Mississippi
that acknowledge

949
00:51:05.023 --> 00:51:06.900
white violence against
African-Americans?

950
00:51:06.941 --> 00:51:10.570
- The only marker of
which I am aware that exist.

951
00:51:10.612 --> 00:51:15.283
that depicts and talks about
white violence against black

952
00:51:15.325 --> 00:51:19.329
people during reconstruction
is the Clinton riot marker.

953
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:22.123
[Director] In Mississippi?
- In Mississippi.

954
00:51:23.458 --> 00:51:25.043
- My name is Missy Jones.

955
00:51:25.085 --> 00:51:26.336
My title is a Visiting

956
00:51:26.378 --> 00:51:29.464
Instructor of History
at Mississippi College.

957
00:51:29.506 --> 00:51:31.675
[Director] How long have you
been working on the Clinton
riot?

958
00:51:31.966 --> 00:51:34.177
- Almost 15 years now

959
00:51:34.219 --> 00:51:36.596
if I think back.

960
00:51:37.806 --> 00:51:39.265
[Director] What is this?

961
00:51:39.307 --> 00:51:41.559
- This is Johnson
Milling Company.

962
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:47.273
it's been here for ages.
but right behind it is

963
00:51:47.315 --> 00:51:50.151
the location of the
old train depot.

964
00:51:50.193 --> 00:51:51.778
And the thought was that we

965
00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.782
would put the marker
for the Clinton riot here

966
00:51:55.824 --> 00:51:59.494
because of the importance
of the train depot.

967
00:52:04.416 --> 00:52:05.834
The Clinton riots began

968
00:52:05.875 --> 00:52:11.339
on September 4th. 1875.
and the diorama behind me

969
00:52:11.381 --> 00:52:16.344
tells a version of those events.
The original train depot is

970
00:52:16.386 --> 00:52:20.348
where white paramilitary
units flocked into Clinton.

971
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:22.809
There was a political rally

972
00:52:22.851 --> 00:52:26.479
and it was one of the first
times that African-Americans had

973
00:52:26.521 --> 00:52:29.858
gotten together to really
listen to political candidates.

974
00:52:29.899 --> 00:52:32.902
And it was organized
by the Republican Party.

975
00:52:32.944 --> 00:52:34.654
But there was also a group

976
00:52:34.696 --> 00:52:38.533
of white Democrats who were
sent there to disrupt things.

977
00:52:38.575 --> 00:52:41.161
Shots rang out. African-American

978
00:52:41.202 --> 00:52:43.872
families began
to flee the scene.

979
00:52:43.913 --> 00:52:46.207
Even one mother left her child

980
00:52:46.249 --> 00:52:48.835
in the hollow of a tree
just for protection.

981
00:52:48.877 --> 00:52:52.630
And then over the course
of the next several days.

982
00:52:52.672 --> 00:52:56.009
white liner's began to flood
into Clinton and then

983
00:52:56.051 --> 00:52:59.929
systematically round up those
who organized the rally and then

984
00:52:59.971 --> 00:53:03.683
kill them. sometimes in front
of their own family members.

985
00:53:03.725 --> 00:53:05.185
[Director] So this is
a group of white

986
00:53:05.226 --> 00:53:08.188
Democrats killing the black
Republicans?

987
00:53:08.229 --> 00:53:10.607
[Missy] Correct.
It was the plan of the white

988
00:53:10.648 --> 00:53:14.694
Democrats to keep
African-Americans from voting.

989
00:53:19.532 --> 00:53:22.952
The violence served as a pretext
for the return of white rule

990
00:53:22.994 --> 00:53:26.539
and the end of reconstruction
in Mississippi.

991
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:28.917
[Director] Do you
feel like people

992
00:53:28.958 --> 00:53:30.877
know that this marker exists?

993
00:53:30.919 --> 00:53:32.128
- No. I don't.

994
00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:35.757
Just given where it is behind
this old mill.

995
00:53:35.799 --> 00:53:40.387
I feel like it has
the potential to look hidden.

996
00:53:40.428 --> 00:53:43.556
And that was my fear
with placing it here.

997
00:53:43.598 --> 00:53:46.601
I would definitely prefer it
to be in a more prominent

998
00:53:46.643 --> 00:53:52.273
location because this event is
by far the most important event

999
00:53:52.315 --> 00:53:54.776
that ever took
place in the city.

1000
00:53:55.902 --> 00:54:01.032
The Clinton riot has always been
one of these contested events.

1001
00:54:02.617 --> 00:54:05.036
For years and years and years.
it's been told

1002
00:54:05.078 --> 00:54:07.956
as if it was caused
by African-Americans. That they

1003
00:54:07.997 --> 00:54:11.626
were going to take back
the city. accost the women.

1004
00:54:14.796 --> 00:54:17.507
For essentially one hundred
and forty years.

1005
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:21.386
the history was told incorrectly
and the violence was blamed

1006
00:54:21.428 --> 00:54:24.472
on the black members
of the Clinton community.

1007
00:54:28.476 --> 00:54:30.520
- Hi. my name is
James Robinson.

1008
00:54:30.562 --> 00:54:32.939
I'm from here in Clinton.

1009
00:54:32.981 --> 00:54:36.109
Lifetime residence. except
for a few years.

1010
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:37.235
- I'm Deborah.

1011
00:54:37.277 --> 00:54:39.112
James is my cousin.

1012
00:54:39.154 --> 00:54:42.949
- This picture here. Sara Lee.
my grandmother's grandmother.

1013
00:54:42.991 --> 00:54:45.952
When she was caught
in the proximity of the

1014
00:54:45.994 --> 00:54:49.122
Clinton riot in order
to save her child.

1015
00:54:49.164 --> 00:54:51.666
She hid the child in a tree.

1016
00:54:51.708 --> 00:54:54.627
And then after the
skirmish was over.

1017
00:54:54.669 --> 00:54:56.880
then she went back
and and got the child.

1018
00:54:57.881 --> 00:54:59.132
As the article says.

1019
00:54:59.174 --> 00:55:03.803
old Clinton history told
from Tales by Ex Slave.

1020
00:55:03.845 --> 00:55:07.432
This was published
in the newspaper in 1961.

1021
00:55:07.474 --> 00:55:10.310
- As far as the black
citizens in Clinton.

1022
00:55:10.352 --> 00:55:11.811
you don't hear
a lot about our history.

1023
00:55:11.853 --> 00:55:15.982
And a lot of times I think our
elders have tended to just

1024
00:55:16.024 --> 00:55:18.610
discuss things among
themselves as opposed

1025
00:55:18.651 --> 00:55:20.445
to bringing it
to the forefront.

1026
00:55:20.487 --> 00:55:24.366
Because it can stir
up a lot of emotions.

1027
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.409
[Director] And what's
the result

1028
00:55:26.451 --> 00:55:27.744
of stirring up emotions?

1029
00:55:27.786 --> 00:55:29.871
- You get a lot of good
and you get some bad.

1030
00:55:31.247 --> 00:55:32.665
[Director] What's the bad?

1031
00:55:32.707 --> 00:55:33.833
- The fact that somebody could

1032
00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:35.919
vandalize if you put up
anything.

1033
00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:38.505
- I just hope that that
doesn't happen in Clinton.

1034
00:55:38.546 --> 00:55:41.216
There's still a lot
of racist attitudes.

1035
00:55:41.257 --> 00:55:44.761
- There are some that
and I'm thinking about Missy.

1036
00:55:44.803 --> 00:55:48.181
When I first met Missy.
she said the first word

1037
00:55:48.223 --> 00:55:49.891
that came out of her
mouth was nigger.

1038
00:55:50.767 --> 00:55:52.268
And her parents were so proud

1039
00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:56.690
of her when she said that word
because that meant that you

1040
00:55:56.731 --> 00:55:59.275
knew you were superior
to somebody else.

1041
00:56:00.068 --> 00:56:03.113
[Director] You've been so
dedicated for so long.

1042
00:56:03.154 --> 00:56:08.952
You've dedicated so much care
and time and effort to this.

1043
00:56:10.704 --> 00:56:12.497
Why do you care about this?

1044
00:56:18.628 --> 00:56:20.380
- I'm going to get emotional.

1045
00:56:20.422 --> 00:56:25.468
but I grew up in a family
in Mississippi.

1046
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:29.305
My dad was from New York.
my mom's family was from

1047
00:56:29.347 --> 00:56:32.100
South Mississippi.
90 percent white.

1048
00:56:32.142 --> 00:56:35.895
10 percent black.
still segregated in the ways

1049
00:56:35.937 --> 00:56:38.732
in which people
in the communities live.

1050
00:56:40.233 --> 00:56:41.693
But I was raised in a racist

1051
00:56:41.735 --> 00:56:45.905
family. racist community at
the time in which I grew up.

1052
00:56:45.947 --> 00:56:53.204
Things have changed in a good
bit now. but for me. I think

1053
00:56:53.246 --> 00:56:55.248
they want to repeat that.

1054
00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:59.669
I feel responsibility
with a profession that I've

1055
00:56:59.711 --> 00:57:03.798
chosen to tell things
accurately and to not

1056
00:57:05.508 --> 00:57:07.886
repeat generational

1057
00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:09.971
umm

1058
00:57:11.973 --> 00:57:13.433
incorrectness

1059
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:17.687
with my own family. I want
to do something different.

1060
00:57:24.652 --> 00:57:26.321
[Student] Why are you passionate
about this project?

1061
00:57:26.363 --> 00:57:30.450
Just like what drives you
with making this documentary?

1062
00:57:30.492 --> 00:57:32.452
- You know. I didn't
start as passionate.

1063
00:57:32.494 --> 00:57:35.080
I started as curious.
- Yeah.

1064
00:57:35.121 --> 00:57:36.790
- And I had this sense
that there was something

1065
00:57:36.831 --> 00:57:39.542
missing in the story
that I had been taught.

1066
00:57:39.584 --> 00:57:40.960
And it's only through

1067
00:57:41.002 --> 00:57:43.963
the making of this film
that I've really come to see

1068
00:57:44.005 --> 00:57:46.675
that that story
was totally white.

1069
00:57:46.716 --> 00:57:48.802
I used to think that white
supremacy means a bunch

1070
00:57:48.843 --> 00:57:51.805
of guys in white robes.
but it really means not even

1071
00:57:51.846 --> 00:57:54.808
recognizing that we're only
telling white stories.

1072
00:58:06.528 --> 00:58:10.532
(southern instrumental music)

1073
00:58:32.846 --> 00:58:34.848
[Dr. Blight] During the
reconstruction era.

1074
00:58:34.889 --> 00:58:36.933
there's fear
all over the place.

1075
00:58:40.145 --> 00:58:42.188
White fear of those black

1076
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:47.360
majority populations. if they
really vote. was colossal.

1077
00:58:47.402 --> 00:58:49.571
So many white Southerners saw

1078
00:58:49.612 --> 00:58:52.323
this idea of black people
serving on juries.

1079
00:58:52.365 --> 00:58:57.287
of black people owning land
as an intolerable revolution.

1080
00:59:01.916 --> 00:59:04.711
And it necessitated
a counter-revolution.

1081
00:59:04.753 --> 00:59:07.672
even if it necessitated the
use of terror as violence.

1082
00:59:12.677 --> 00:59:14.554
A lost cause tradition was

1083
00:59:14.596 --> 00:59:17.307
a response to that
tremendous fear.

1084
00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:20.060
We like to go to
bed at night

1085
00:59:20.101 --> 00:59:23.480
believing our society
is in social order.

1086
00:59:24.356 --> 00:59:26.733
I don't have to worry about
my child tomorrow being

1087
00:59:26.775 --> 00:59:32.572
confronted by totally
unusual and repugnant ideas or

1088
00:59:32.614 --> 00:59:34.699
totally unusual
and repugnant people.

1089
00:59:35.575 --> 00:59:39.829
I'm safe by the
history I know.

1090
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:42.999
So the lost cause tradition

1091
00:59:43.041 --> 00:59:46.169
that Southerners
developed. this story

1092
00:59:46.211 --> 00:59:49.756
for their explanation of their
defeat became ultimately

1093
00:59:49.798 --> 00:59:53.426
a victory narrative.
Victory over reconstruction.

1094
00:59:53.468 --> 00:59:57.222
And they crushed the very idea
of slavery as the central

1095
00:59:57.263 --> 01:00:00.392
cause and the very idea
of emancipation of four

1096
01:00:00.433 --> 01:00:04.521
million slaves as the central
result of the civil war.

1097
01:00:04.562 --> 01:00:11.027
You begin to see wide scale.
even official efforts to crush

1098
01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:13.613
what we might call
black memory.

1099
01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:15.865
- If we throw away our

1100
01:00:15.907 --> 01:00:20.161
Confederate flag.
we throw away the history

1101
01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:25.000
of South Carolina
and of the United States.

1102
01:00:29.754 --> 01:00:32.507
- We are true Southerners.
I guess.

1103
01:00:32.924 --> 01:00:35.176
To me it's a flag
for everybody.

1104
01:00:35.218 --> 01:00:37.470
black and white.
representing our heritage.

1105
01:00:37.804 --> 01:00:40.223
Can understand to some degree

1106
01:00:40.265 --> 01:00:42.809
how they would have
been upset years ago.

1107
01:00:42.851 --> 01:00:44.853
That's been one hundred
and thirty years ago now.

1108
01:00:44.894 --> 01:00:46.688
To me. it's our flag.

1109
01:00:47.772 --> 01:00:51.317
(crowd chanting)

1110
01:01:11.504 --> 01:01:13.089
- White only. no blacks!

1111
01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:15.175
Send them home!

1112
01:01:18.094 --> 01:01:20.263
[News Reporter] Breaking news.
a horrific scene

1113
01:01:20.305 --> 01:01:23.350
in Charlottesville. Virginia.
A white nationalist rally

1114
01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:27.020
that descended into deadly
violence and chaos.

1115
01:01:27.062 --> 01:01:28.688
- Since the city voted
to remove the

1116
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:29.939
Robert E. Lee statue.

1117
01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:33.943
there have been protests.
and now violence.

1118
01:01:35.695 --> 01:01:37.530
[Director] Tell me your name.
Who are you?

1119
01:01:37.572 --> 01:01:40.992
- I'm Stephanie Rolph and I'm
an assistant professor

1120
01:01:41.034 --> 01:01:44.371
of history at Millsaps College
in Jackson. Mississippi.

1121
01:01:44.412 --> 01:01:45.872
The images that we're seeing

1122
01:01:45.914 --> 01:01:48.875
on our computers and on our
phones and on television.

1123
01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:51.586
you can't divorce this
from the need to return

1124
01:01:51.628 --> 01:01:53.380
to some sort of
innocent past.

1125
01:01:53.421 --> 01:01:54.422
[Director] Like the old South?

1126
01:01:54.464 --> 01:01:55.507
- Yes.

1127
01:01:55.548 --> 01:01:57.509
[Director] What is the
old South?

1128
01:01:57.550 --> 01:01:58.885
- After the Civil War?

1129
01:01:58.927 --> 01:02:04.766
The old South myth is this
mythologized place of

1130
01:02:05.767 --> 01:02:08.353
big plantation houses

1131
01:02:08.395 --> 01:02:13.066
with Corinthian columns and
mint juleps and hoop skirts

1132
01:02:13.108 --> 01:02:16.152
and Southern gentleman
and happy slaves.

1133
01:02:16.194 --> 01:02:18.196
Everyone is well
taken care of.

1134
01:02:18.238 --> 01:02:21.199
Some people are owned by other
people. but everyone is well

1135
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:24.744
fed. well clothed.
loved and appreciated.

1136
01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:26.162
And that is not--

1137
01:02:26.204 --> 01:02:28.248
this is why something like
this would appeal to white

1138
01:02:28.289 --> 01:02:30.125
northerners.
because that's not

1139
01:02:30.166 --> 01:02:32.669
the environment
that they lived in.

1140
01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:34.421
[Director] It's really a story
about the

1141
01:02:34.462 --> 01:02:36.089
merits of white supremacy.

1142
01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:37.507
You know.
I filmed with another

1143
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:39.634
historian who said that it was
really white supremacy

1144
01:02:39.676 --> 01:02:43.096
that helped the north and the
south reunify after the war.

1145
01:02:43.138 --> 01:02:44.973
Do you think that's true?

1146
01:02:45.015 --> 01:02:48.852
- I fully believe that
when we're talking.

1147
01:02:48.893 --> 01:02:51.229
even across the spectrum
from the coming of the civil

1148
01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:53.982
war to the prosecution of it
and the aftermath.

1149
01:02:54.024 --> 01:02:56.901
I think it's a much more
productive approach

1150
01:02:56.943 --> 01:03:00.363
to describe
and understand white supremacy

1151
01:03:00.405 --> 01:03:03.783
than it is to even
talk about slavery.

1152
01:03:03.825 --> 01:03:07.203
Slavery doesn't survive.
but white supremacy does.

1153
01:03:11.082 --> 01:03:14.919
The war ends.
reconciliation has been

1154
01:03:14.961 --> 01:03:19.674
achieved.
what happens unexpectedly is

1155
01:03:19.716 --> 01:03:24.971
that in that reconciliation.
the nation itself embraces

1156
01:03:25.013 --> 01:03:29.100
the Confederacy and the memory
of the Confederacy.

1157
01:03:29.142 --> 01:03:31.811
This is why by the time you
get to the 1930's.

1158
01:03:31.853 --> 01:03:33.938
people from all over
the country are coming

1159
01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.982
to places like Natchez.
Mississippi.

1160
01:03:36.024 --> 01:03:39.611
to tour antebellum homes
and to see women in

1161
01:03:39.652 --> 01:03:43.948
hoop skirts and people dressed
up as enslaved persons.

1162
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:46.534
This is a vacation for them.

1163
01:03:46.576 --> 01:03:51.206
Can you think of a cultural
footprint of this today?

1164
01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:55.168
Where the South gets sort
of fetishized?

1165
01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:58.254
- Grades second through fifth.
like we used to go almost

1166
01:03:58.296 --> 01:04:00.924
every year to the
Destrehan Plantation.

1167
01:04:00.965 --> 01:04:05.220
- And what does that
tour include?

1168
01:04:06.429 --> 01:04:08.348
- It included tours
of the plantation.

1169
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:11.935
They also had a little show
put on. people dressed up

1170
01:04:11.976 --> 01:04:15.397
and stuff. and they sang
songs. played music.

1171
01:04:17.565 --> 01:04:19.776
It was like a. it's almost
like a little party.

1172
01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:23.947
- Are the tours in any way
engaging enslavement?

1173
01:04:23.988 --> 01:04:26.032
- They don't really talk
about the slavery part.

1174
01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:28.910
You might have a good time
because. I used to look

1175
01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:30.537
forward to going
to the plantation.

1176
01:04:30.578 --> 01:04:32.122
It was a big deal.

1177
01:04:32.163 --> 01:04:33.623
- I mean. can we even think

1178
01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:38.586
about these plantations
as spaces of violence?

1179
01:04:39.796 --> 01:04:43.299
When we think about things
like Confederate monuments or

1180
01:04:43.341 --> 01:04:46.386
symbols and flags.
all of these remembrances

1181
01:04:46.428 --> 01:04:50.890
on white visions. those are
renewals of white supremacy.

1182
01:04:50.932 --> 01:04:52.517
And in my mind.

1183
01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:55.854
keeping that Confederate
battle flag in the top left

1184
01:04:55.895 --> 01:04:58.106
corner of
Mississippi State flag.

1185
01:05:00.108 --> 01:05:03.028
is a way to keep
that narrative alive.

1186
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:04.404
And it's threatening because

1187
01:05:04.446 --> 01:05:07.574
if we lose it.
what happens to our memory?

1188
01:05:08.158 --> 01:05:12.120
(quiet thoughtful music)

1189
01:05:17.625 --> 01:05:20.253
- My name is William Shirley.

1190
01:05:21.129 --> 01:05:22.797
I serve in the Mississippi
House of Representatives

1191
01:05:22.839 --> 01:05:27.552
for District 84. about 16.000
people in the whole county.

1192
01:05:27.594 --> 01:05:29.095
Everybody knows everybody.

1193
01:05:29.137 --> 01:05:31.348
You get a speeding ticket.
everybody knows.

1194
01:05:31.389 --> 01:05:34.059
I'm not here to argue
the design of the flag.

1195
01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.936
That is not my intent.

1196
01:05:36.978 --> 01:05:39.314
Some universities
took the flag down.

1197
01:05:39.939 --> 01:05:41.399
If you're receiving state

1198
01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:44.152
dollars and you're a public
university. then you should

1199
01:05:44.194 --> 01:05:46.946
display whatever
that symbol is.

1200
01:05:46.988 --> 01:05:48.323
[Director] And do you
think this is

1201
01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:50.450
an issue that matters to the
people in your district?

1202
01:05:50.992 --> 01:05:53.370
- Yes. ma'am.
- Why?

1203
01:05:53.411 --> 01:05:56.664
- Well. I just think it's a
heritage. it's a history.

1204
01:05:56.706 --> 01:06:01.711
There's a big movement to
remove Confederate history.

1205
01:06:01.753 --> 01:06:04.005
Well. it's part of history.

1206
01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:07.634
You know.
where and when is enough?

1207
01:06:07.676 --> 01:06:09.135
[Director] Do you feel like

1208
01:06:09.177 --> 01:06:11.054
slavery was something
that was in the past?

1209
01:06:11.096 --> 01:06:12.722
Let's move on.

1210
01:06:12.764 --> 01:06:16.184
Or do you feel like slavery
still has an effect today?

1211
01:06:17.477 --> 01:06:21.147
- It's over and
it is part of history.

1212
01:06:21.189 --> 01:06:22.982
it's part of the past.
I don't know of a

1213
01:06:23.024 --> 01:06:27.070
person that owns
a slave or has been a slave.

1214
01:06:27.904 --> 01:06:29.364
To this day.

1215
01:06:30.031 --> 01:06:31.241
I think we're going to make it

1216
01:06:31.282 --> 01:06:34.244
a major issue as long as we
keep rubbing it

1217
01:06:34.285 --> 01:06:38.164
in from the standpoint
of the minority saying. well.

1218
01:06:38.206 --> 01:06:41.167
we were slaves and mistreated.
I understand that.

1219
01:06:41.209 --> 01:06:43.378
What the hell do you
want me to do about it?

1220
01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.504
I'm sorry.

1221
01:06:44.546 --> 01:06:46.631
I wasn't there.
I'm 50 years old.

1222
01:06:46.673 --> 01:06:48.049
I wasn't there.

1223
01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:49.509
[Director] And what do you say
to historically black

1224
01:06:49.551 --> 01:06:52.012
universities that say. we're
not going to fly this flag

1225
01:06:52.053 --> 01:06:54.014
because it's
a symbol of slavery?

1226
01:06:54.055 --> 01:06:55.640
Do you think about
their point of view?

1227
01:06:56.766 --> 01:06:59.602
- It is. It's a state flag
of Mississippi.

1228
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:04.107
[Director] But if they say
it actually hurts us.

1229
01:07:04.149 --> 01:07:05.525
it deeply offends us.

1230
01:07:05.567 --> 01:07:08.111
it represents something
that gives us pain.

1231
01:07:08.153 --> 01:07:09.404
What do you say to that?

1232
01:07:14.617 --> 01:07:18.538
- I don't see the pain
in in the symbol.

1233
01:07:22.167 --> 01:07:25.587
(chanting and sirens)

1234
01:07:29.257 --> 01:07:31.051
- New Orleans is just
the latest city

1235
01:07:31.092 --> 01:07:33.219
to start taking
down historical.

1236
01:07:33.261 --> 01:07:35.972
but controversial
monuments that many say

1237
01:07:36.014 --> 01:07:38.141
celebrates slavery
and the Confederacy.

1238
01:07:38.183 --> 01:07:39.893
- White supremacy!
- Must go!

1239
01:07:39.934 --> 01:07:41.561
- When?
- Now!

1240
01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:42.729
- When?
- Now!

1241
01:07:42.771 --> 01:07:44.439
- All right! All right!

1242
01:07:44.481 --> 01:07:46.649
We're here to celebrate
the taking down

1243
01:07:46.691 --> 01:07:49.986
of the Jefferson Davis statue
here in New Orleans Center.

1244
01:07:50.612 --> 01:07:55.367
These were all Jim Crow era
statues meant to emphasize

1245
01:07:55.408 --> 01:07:57.369
that white people
were in control.

1246
01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:58.787
[Director] Is there any value--

1247
01:07:58.828 --> 01:08:01.873
- There is no value
in keeping those statues.

1248
01:08:02.332 --> 01:08:03.875
There is value in remembering

1249
01:08:03.917 --> 01:08:05.710
what these statues
were put up for.

1250
01:08:05.752 --> 01:08:07.170
(people yelling)

1251
01:08:07.212 --> 01:08:09.422
- What do you say to the
people across the street

1252
01:08:09.464 --> 01:08:10.757
who are marching with flags--

1253
01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.092
- I don't say nothing

1254
01:08:12.133 --> 01:08:13.635
to the people across
the street who are marching.

1255
01:08:13.677 --> 01:08:16.262
They are not on my radar.
They are unredeemable

1256
01:08:16.304 --> 01:08:17.681
as far as I know.

1257
01:08:17.722 --> 01:08:19.974
- We pray. oh Lord. that
those who are attacking

1258
01:08:20.016 --> 01:08:22.602
our heritage may
repent of their sins.

1259
01:08:22.644 --> 01:08:24.145
We pray. oh Lord.

1260
01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:26.648
that the truth of history
would triumph.

1261
01:08:27.691 --> 01:08:29.484
[Director] I feel like
the country never

1262
01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:31.194
really reunified after the war

1263
01:08:31.236 --> 01:08:33.947
in a way that included all
of its citizens. right?

1264
01:08:33.988 --> 01:08:35.615
Like maybe taking down these

1265
01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:38.368
statues now could
help us reunify.

1266
01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:40.286
- But don't try to take away

1267
01:08:40.328 --> 01:08:42.122
history just because you
don't agree with it.

1268
01:08:42.163 --> 01:08:43.832
And if you really
study history.

1269
01:08:43.873 --> 01:08:46.751
you'll see there's more...
It was more than just slavery.

1270
01:08:46.793 --> 01:08:48.294
There was taxation issues.

1271
01:08:48.336 --> 01:08:50.338
[Director] Hold on.
Is he putting on a--

1272
01:08:51.339 --> 01:08:52.966
a bulletproof vest?

1273
01:08:53.008 --> 01:08:54.384
- Probably.
- Why?

1274
01:08:54.426 --> 01:08:56.052
- Because they were firing

1275
01:08:56.094 --> 01:08:58.847
paintball at these
guys the other night.

1276
01:08:59.973 --> 01:09:01.766
Sounds harmless.

1277
01:09:01.808 --> 01:09:04.853
but who's to say that they
don't try something more?

1278
01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.980
A lot of these people
from out of town.

1279
01:09:07.022 --> 01:09:08.690
- These are visitors
from out of town

1280
01:09:09.858 --> 01:09:12.610
who are Confederate
supporters. and they come here

1281
01:09:12.652 --> 01:09:15.238
to occupy a city for a couple
of weeks and stand their

1282
01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.532
ground and all
that good stuff.

1283
01:09:17.574 --> 01:09:19.159
[Director] But isn't
the goal to have

1284
01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.410
more people feel represented?

1285
01:09:20.452 --> 01:09:22.829
I mean. don't we need
to listen to each other?

1286
01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:25.707
They said the statue's
a source of Southern pride.

1287
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:28.501
- Fuck the south.
Fuck Southern pride.

1288
01:09:28.543 --> 01:09:29.544
Umm

1289
01:09:30.879 --> 01:09:32.213
The source of all of this
tension and anger comes

1290
01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:35.467
from the erasure
of African-Americans. history.

1291
01:09:35.508 --> 01:09:38.178
bloodlines. culture.
families for hundreds of years

1292
01:09:38.219 --> 01:09:40.138
by way of this thing
that they're upholding.

1293
01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.349
Ok. so if you can't balance

1294
01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:45.018
that in your mind.
then I can't do anything

1295
01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:46.936
for your lack of an IQ
or common sense.

1296
01:09:46.978 --> 01:09:47.854
I'm sorry.

1297
01:09:47.896 --> 01:09:48.897
- It's not about race.

1298
01:09:48.938 --> 01:09:50.398
This has never
been about race.

1299
01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.567
I feel like we're
having our history

1300
01:09:53.234 --> 01:09:54.611
stolen from us.

1301
01:09:54.652 --> 01:09:56.112
This was our only
Confederate president.

1302
01:09:56.154 --> 01:09:57.197
He died here.

1303
01:09:57.238 --> 01:09:58.365
- You don't need
to have that in

1304
01:09:58.406 --> 01:09:59.783
our diverse neighborhood.

1305
01:09:59.824 --> 01:10:03.036
- How is a inanimate
object like a symbol.

1306
01:10:03.078 --> 01:10:05.246
affecting you so
gravely that you

1307
01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:07.123
cannot see a [inaudible].

1308
01:10:07.165 --> 01:10:08.333
(crowd starts chanting)

1309
01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:11.753
* Get the fuck out
of New Orleans *

1310
01:10:12.212 --> 01:10:15.131
* Get the fuck out
of New Orleans *

1311
01:10:15.173 --> 01:10:17.509
- I pray for America.
I really do.

1312
01:10:18.426 --> 01:10:20.970
(crowd cheering)

1313
01:10:35.527 --> 01:10:36.945
- Dear God. our
Heavenly Father.

1314
01:10:36.986 --> 01:10:38.780
we thank you for your

1315
01:10:38.822 --> 01:10:42.617
love and your grace and your
mercy and please bless us

1316
01:10:42.659 --> 01:10:46.913
during the coming hour as we
pay homage to our ancestors.

1317
01:10:46.955 --> 01:10:50.542
the fifteen thousand two
hundred and sixty five souls

1318
01:10:50.583 --> 01:10:53.294
that gave their life to defend
the great state

1319
01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:55.296
of Mississippi.
For Christ's sake. Amen.

1320
01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:56.548
(all)
- Amen.

1321
01:10:56.589 --> 01:10:58.800
- Our next speaker is
someone that I really

1322
01:10:58.842 --> 01:11:01.094
appreciate and he's
got backbone.

1323
01:11:01.136 --> 01:11:03.805
And that's the kind of people
we need. people to stand up.

1324
01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:07.267
Mr. William Shirley
of Clark County.

1325
01:11:07.308 --> 01:11:08.935
would you come
say a few words?

1326
01:11:09.853 --> 01:11:10.979
Good man!
- Yeah!

1327
01:11:11.688 --> 01:11:14.315
(clapping)

1328
01:11:15.483 --> 01:11:17.360
- Flag means a
whole lot to me.

1329
01:11:17.944 --> 01:11:19.988
You're not going to take the
damn flag down with my vote.

1330
01:11:21.531 --> 01:11:23.491
So I'm going to do
all I can do.

1331
01:11:23.533 --> 01:11:26.578
And I suggest you find your
legislator and make your ear

1332
01:11:26.619 --> 01:11:30.623
known to him or her.
because we all

1333
01:11:30.665 --> 01:11:32.834
in the Mississippi house are
going to get to vote on them

1334
01:11:32.876 --> 01:11:36.755
amendments again
and again and again.

1335
01:11:36.796 --> 01:11:38.965
And they're going to get
tired of seeing me.

1336
01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:40.467
And they're going to try

1337
01:11:40.508 --> 01:11:43.053
to get somebody to replace
people like me that just don't

1338
01:11:43.094 --> 01:11:45.638
go along with y'alls boss man.

1339
01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.057
If you're taking state

1340
01:11:47.098 --> 01:11:50.185
dollars. you fly the flag
of the state of Mississippi.

1341
01:11:50.226 --> 01:11:52.645
(clapping)

1342
01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:56.358
Thank y'all.

1343
01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:58.318
- I'm gonna let our
Mississippi Senator

1344
01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.320
McDaniel come
up and speak.

1345
01:12:00.362 --> 01:12:02.364
(clapping)

1346
01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:04.324
- Political correctness

1347
01:12:04.366 --> 01:12:06.034
is an incredibly
dangerous doctrine.

1348
01:12:07.369 --> 01:12:09.329
It's anti intellectual.

1349
01:12:09.371 --> 01:12:13.333
It's anti decent.
It demands conformity.

1350
01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:15.001
Do you believe they'll stop
with a monument?

1351
01:12:15.043 --> 01:12:16.836
Do you believe they'll
stop with a pattern

1352
01:12:16.878 --> 01:12:18.046
or design on a flag?

1353
01:12:18.088 --> 01:12:20.507
They ridicule our traditions.

1354
01:12:20.548 --> 01:12:22.550
They mock us.
they laugh at us.

1355
01:12:22.592 --> 01:12:24.469
You feel like you're losing
your country. don't you?

1356
01:12:27.222 --> 01:12:28.890
You feel marginalized.

1357
01:12:29.557 --> 01:12:30.934
You're scared.

1358
01:12:32.352 --> 01:12:33.728
Mississippi has to stand.

1359
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:35.563
We have nothing
else to surrender.

1360
01:12:35.605 --> 01:12:36.898
We are those warriors.

1361
01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:39.526
men and women of the soil.
stubborn. courageous.

1362
01:12:39.567 --> 01:12:40.777
We stand here on the edge

1363
01:12:40.819 --> 01:12:44.698
of history. ready to push
back one more time.

1364
01:12:44.739 --> 01:12:46.491
Help's not coming
from California.

1365
01:12:46.533 --> 01:12:47.575
It's not coming
from Massachusetts.

1366
01:12:47.617 --> 01:12:48.868
It has to be you.

1367
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:50.161
What are you going
to do about it?

1368
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.168
(dramatic music swells)

1369
01:13:04.092 --> 01:13:06.469
- How would you like to
see Uncle Billy dance?

1370
01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:08.138
(children clapping)

1371
01:13:08.972 --> 01:13:11.933
(harmonica music)

1372
01:13:11.975 --> 01:13:14.144
(tap dancing)

1373
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:21.317
[Dr. Blight] At the end of the
day. historical memory is always

1374
01:13:21.359 --> 01:13:24.738
about who is
controlling the story.

1375
01:13:26.531 --> 01:13:29.325
And you got to do it
in a society that has this

1376
01:13:29.367 --> 01:13:34.664
horrible problem with racism.
The theories of race that most

1377
01:13:34.706 --> 01:13:38.877
white Americans.
north or south. still share.

1378
01:13:41.129 --> 01:13:45.467
(dramatic music)

1379
01:13:50.889 --> 01:13:53.975
By the 1890's
in the north.

1380
01:13:54.017 --> 01:13:57.937
there's a tremendous fear
of a world that seems to be

1381
01:13:57.979 --> 01:14:01.274
floating into disorder
in these teeming new cities

1382
01:14:01.316 --> 01:14:05.612
full of these immigrants
speaking unusual languages.

1383
01:14:09.824 --> 01:14:12.994
Maybe the race question should
just be left to the South.

1384
01:14:17.248 --> 01:14:20.752
They've always known how
to handle the race question

1385
01:14:22.671 --> 01:14:25.465
at the same time.
there will be over nine

1386
01:14:25.507 --> 01:14:28.176
million African-Americans.
mostly in the South.

1387
01:14:29.803 --> 01:14:31.471
There's no longer the slavery

1388
01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:33.807
system that kept
this all contained.

1389
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:37.769
White Southerners need to keep

1390
01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:41.690
this burgeoning black
population on the land as

1391
01:14:41.731 --> 01:14:45.652
laborers not engaging
in educational advancement.

1392
01:14:45.694 --> 01:14:48.738
They need a new system
to keep them there.

1393
01:14:49.864 --> 01:14:53.868
The solution in the south was
a system of Jim Crow laws.

1394
01:14:54.536 --> 01:14:56.037
Everything from schooling

1395
01:14:56.079 --> 01:14:59.666
to voting to transportation.
public accommodation.

1396
01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:03.962
every element of life is
now going to be segregated.

1397
01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:06.923
Lots of white Americans.

1398
01:15:06.965 --> 01:15:10.927
North or South.
can unify around segregation

1399
01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:14.097
as a way to keep society
in social order.

1400
01:15:20.645 --> 01:15:22.272
The way in which this culture

1401
01:15:22.313 --> 01:15:26.818
became within the first half
century after the war.

1402
01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:31.656
an American North South
reunion without racial

1403
01:15:31.698 --> 01:15:35.118
justice left a deep
set of legacies

1404
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.746
we are. of course.
still struggling with.

1405
01:15:37.787 --> 01:15:41.541
And every time we think we
have so much of this put

1406
01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:45.754
aside. we suddenly are
reminded that we don't.

1407
01:15:46.629 --> 01:15:49.132
(crowd yelling)

1408
01:15:51.176 --> 01:15:57.265
The only way today we'll see
a new. more inclusive reunion

1409
01:15:57.307 --> 01:16:01.311
of Americans is if there's
a coalition of interest

1410
01:16:01.353 --> 01:16:04.064
that stops looking only
at their own individual

1411
01:16:04.105 --> 01:16:08.735
interest and sees themselves
in these four or five issues

1412
01:16:08.777 --> 01:16:10.653
and sees themselves
in other people.

1413
01:16:14.115 --> 01:16:15.325
Ok.

1414
01:16:21.915 --> 01:16:23.416
[Director] We're just
going to record

1415
01:16:23.458 --> 01:16:24.793
the sound of the
room a little bit.

1416
01:16:24.834 --> 01:16:27.087
And then if you could
change the frame too.

1417
01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:29.297
There you go.

1418
01:16:30.006 --> 01:16:32.175
If I were going to make
a movie about you.

1419
01:16:32.217 --> 01:16:35.011
what do you want me to make
sure that I include?

1420
01:16:36.346 --> 01:16:37.639
- I want you to show like

1421
01:16:38.932 --> 01:16:41.017
the great things
that I'm capable of.

1422
01:16:41.059 --> 01:16:42.310
Like.

1423
01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:46.981
yeah. I'm if if I
do say so myself. I'm a great

1424
01:16:48.108 --> 01:16:50.944
football player. but I'm
also smart in the classroom.

1425
01:16:50.985 --> 01:16:54.739
I try I try to be-- I'm just
trying to be great in life.

1426
01:16:54.781 --> 01:16:55.865
I'm trying to make something
of my life.

1427
01:16:55.907 --> 01:16:57.367
trying to be successful.

1428
01:16:57.409 --> 01:17:00.453
- To be honest with
you. what I've been through.

1429
01:17:00.495 --> 01:17:02.622
There are people who just look

1430
01:17:02.664 --> 01:17:04.624
at the good things.
look at the good things.

1431
01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:08.128
but I'd rather you see
what the negativity was.

1432
01:17:08.169 --> 01:17:11.214
So it's like it counteracts
it's like here's the bad.

1433
01:17:11.256 --> 01:17:13.299
But now here where
I'm at. I'm good now.

1434
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:14.718
I'm in a good zone.

1435
01:17:14.759 --> 01:17:17.178
I was in-- you know what
I'm saying? It's more like I'd

1436
01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:19.764
rather you not just tell half
of my story. I'd rather

1437
01:17:19.806 --> 01:17:21.349
you tell the whole story.

1438
01:17:23.268 --> 01:17:26.604
- There was this one where a
teacher once described me as

1439
01:17:27.022 --> 01:17:28.773
I think it was sympathetic.

1440
01:17:30.525 --> 01:17:32.986
I thought she called me
pathetic when she said that.

1441
01:17:33.028 --> 01:17:34.320
[Director] It might have
an empathetic.

1442
01:17:34.362 --> 01:17:35.405
- Empathetic. yeah.

1443
01:17:35.447 --> 01:17:36.364
At the end of the day.
it's just like

1444
01:17:37.574 --> 01:17:39.034
you know. we all
have feelings.

1445
01:17:39.075 --> 01:17:41.953
We all have like a history
that nobody else knows about.

1446
01:17:43.747 --> 01:17:45.331
Yeah.

1447
01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:49.919
(thoughtful music)

1448
01:17:57.927 --> 01:18:01.097
- I was certainly not taught
this way in my high school.

1449
01:18:01.139 --> 01:18:02.807
(all laugh)

1450
01:18:02.849 --> 01:18:04.434
So--
- Neither was I!

1451
01:18:05.226 --> 01:18:08.188
- I'm always shocked when I
find students of a certain age

1452
01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:10.607
who haven't seen
Gone with the Wind.

1453
01:18:10.648 --> 01:18:12.359
And I point them to it.

1454
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.735
You need to watch that film.

1455
01:18:13.777 --> 01:18:17.697
[Kelly] It was the most watched
movie of all time.

1456
01:18:17.739 --> 01:18:19.532
People are eating
this stuff up

1457
01:18:19.574 --> 01:18:21.868
like there's a real reason why

1458
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:24.120
people have weddings
on plantations.

1459
01:18:24.162 --> 01:18:25.872
Like you would never.
you would

1460
01:18:25.914 --> 01:18:28.375
never go to Auschwitz and be
like. let's get married.

1461
01:18:28.416 --> 01:18:30.460
Like you would never do that.

1462
01:18:30.502 --> 01:18:33.296
But we have so made black pain

1463
01:18:33.338 --> 01:18:36.424
and suffering like a place
of our enjoyment.

1464
01:18:36.466 --> 01:18:40.345
a place that feels good to us.
a place that feels familiar

1465
01:18:40.387 --> 01:18:44.265
to us. that we don't pay
attention to the suffering.

1466
01:18:44.307 --> 01:18:48.853
We don't pay attention
to why it's problematic.

1467
01:18:48.895 --> 01:18:50.605
- I know you talked about
the force in your

1468
01:18:50.647 --> 01:18:55.902
presentation. but how do you
define freedom for yourself?

1469
01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:58.071
- I have been conditioned

1470
01:18:58.113 --> 01:19:01.658
to think of emancipation
as an ending point.

1471
01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:06.579
so I realized that freedom
was not just like liberation.

1472
01:19:06.621 --> 01:19:10.834
Freedom was like
owning your humanity.

1473
01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:13.169
operating in your
full humanity.

1474
01:19:13.211 --> 01:19:16.214
being recognized
for your full humanity.

1475
01:19:16.256 --> 01:19:18.258
I think that the
spirit of slavery.

1476
01:19:18.299 --> 01:19:21.094
that I talked about before.
that makes color a mark

1477
01:19:21.136 --> 01:19:24.180
of degradation is still
very much with us.

1478
01:19:24.222 --> 01:19:27.350
And I think for too long.
the onus of racism has been

1479
01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:30.311
put on people of color
to solve when this is not

1480
01:19:30.353 --> 01:19:31.730
really like a people
of color issue.

1481
01:19:31.771 --> 01:19:33.273
This is like a white

1482
01:19:33.314 --> 01:19:34.941
supremacist issue where white
people need to talk to other

1483
01:19:34.983 --> 01:19:38.820
white people about how they
can overcome these issues.

1484
01:19:38.862 --> 01:19:40.280
White allies today have

1485
01:19:40.321 --> 01:19:44.826
to take a very radical stance
and that they can't just.

1486
01:19:44.868 --> 01:19:46.453
you know. put up
the bumper sticker.

1487
01:19:46.494 --> 01:19:47.662
Black Lives Matter.

1488
01:19:47.704 --> 01:19:49.164
Are you going to allow your

1489
01:19:49.205 --> 01:19:52.292
child to be one of the few
whites in an all black school?

1490
01:19:52.334 --> 01:19:54.377
Are you going to invest
in that school making sure

1491
01:19:54.419 --> 01:19:56.629
that not just your child.
but every child

1492
01:19:56.671 --> 01:20:00.550
in that community gets a fair
shake? To balance like this

1493
01:20:00.592 --> 01:20:04.262
great injustice that's taking
place for hundreds of years

1494
01:20:04.304 --> 01:20:07.265
it requires sacrifice.
I don't know what that will

1495
01:20:07.307 --> 01:20:09.809
look like exactly for you
or for each person.

1496
01:20:09.851 --> 01:20:12.395
It's different.
I think the...

1497
01:20:14.522 --> 01:20:17.359
(reflective music)

1498
01:20:26.284 --> 01:20:29.120
- This is Pleasant Gardens.
This is where most

1499
01:20:29.162 --> 01:20:31.206
of the African-American
in the city were buried.

1500
01:20:32.457 --> 01:20:36.336
It was an operation
from 1891 through 1970.

1501
01:20:37.462 --> 01:20:39.255
Well. one that I saw
in the paper. an article about

1502
01:20:39.297 --> 01:20:41.549
an abandoned cemetery.
and so I thought.

1503
01:20:41.591 --> 01:20:43.885
I can't believe that there's
a place here that's so rich

1504
01:20:43.927 --> 01:20:45.303
with history and I
didn't know about it.

1505
01:20:45.345 --> 01:20:47.847
And so I use the map
on the front of the newspaper

1506
01:20:47.889 --> 01:20:51.351
and drove over to the cemetery
and found this beautiful place

1507
01:20:51.393 --> 01:20:54.938
and immediately felt the need
to organize some community

1508
01:20:54.979 --> 01:20:56.773
cleanups to bring
attention to it.

1509
01:20:57.315 --> 01:20:58.817
Many of the African-Americans

1510
01:20:58.858 --> 01:21:01.903
that are buried here were not
slaves. and so they could be

1511
01:21:01.945 --> 01:21:03.947
buried and recognized
in different ways.

1512
01:21:03.988 --> 01:21:07.701
But there's a very interesting
cemetery called

1513
01:21:07.742 --> 01:21:09.285
Beck Knob Cemetery

1514
01:21:09.327 --> 01:21:12.288
that's located on the
north side of the town.

1515
01:21:12.747 --> 01:21:15.250
And it was a slave cemetery.

1516
01:21:15.291 --> 01:21:19.129
And when you look
at how overgrown it is.

1517
01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:21.589
it's almost sad that

1518
01:21:22.716 --> 01:21:25.176
you can almost drive past it
and not even know it.

1519
01:21:25.218 --> 01:21:26.386
[Director] Would you
take us there?

1520
01:21:26.428 --> 01:21:27.804
- Yeah. I could take
you there.

1521
01:21:27.846 --> 01:21:29.222
but I don't know how much

1522
01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:31.641
you'll be able to see because
it's really overgrown.

1523
01:21:33.143 --> 01:21:36.104
(truck engine roaring)

1524
01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:49.993
Wow.

1525
01:22:02.839 --> 01:22:04.966
(truck engines)

1526
01:22:22.817 --> 01:22:24.569
I knew I wasn't crazy.

1527
01:22:25.445 --> 01:22:28.198
Look how close this
line is to that.

1528
01:22:31.493 --> 01:22:34.162
(peaceful music)

1529
01:23:00.355 --> 01:23:01.815
[Director] What has
been the most

1530
01:23:01.856 --> 01:23:03.149
important story that you've

1531
01:23:03.191 --> 01:23:05.485
talked about in history
class so far this year?

1532
01:23:06.236 --> 01:23:08.238
- Well. slavery was bad.

1533
01:23:08.697 --> 01:23:10.115
We should still feel guilty

1534
01:23:10.156 --> 01:23:12.367
because it's something
that happened.

1535
01:23:12.409 --> 01:23:14.077
[Director] But we
interviewed a kid

1536
01:23:14.119 --> 01:23:15.370
from Estonia and he has white

1537
01:23:15.412 --> 01:23:17.831
skin and his family
wasn't even here.

1538
01:23:17.872 --> 01:23:20.125
Should he feel
guilty about it?

1539
01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:23.712
- Well. if he's living
in our country now.

1540
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:29.426
then I think he should feel
a little guilt because

1541
01:23:29.467 --> 01:23:32.470
it's still
part of his. it's still part

1542
01:23:32.512 --> 01:23:34.681
of his history.
because now he's part of our

1543
01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:38.435
country and he should
feel a little guilt.

1544
01:23:38.476 --> 01:23:39.436
I think.

1545
01:23:40.061 --> 01:23:41.730
[Director] Is guilt useful?

1546
01:23:42.063 --> 01:23:44.024
- Yes.
- Tell me why.

1547
01:23:44.065 --> 01:23:46.276
- Because it helps
us understand that

1548
01:23:46.317 --> 01:23:48.069
what we did was wrong

1549
01:23:48.111 --> 01:23:53.199
and we shouldn't go back
to doing it and we should

1550
01:23:53.241 --> 01:23:56.619
fix our ways so we can
do better in the future.

1551
01:23:57.829 --> 01:24:01.041
- I personally. like. slavery
is morally wrong.

1552
01:24:01.082 --> 01:24:03.043
Like you just shouldn't
own other people.

1553
01:24:03.084 --> 01:24:05.253
That's not something
that should happen.

1554
01:24:05.295 --> 01:24:08.715
But I see the reasoning

1555
01:24:08.757 --> 01:24:14.220
behind it and I can understand
it and not accept it.

1556
01:24:14.888 --> 01:24:16.431
but I guess.

1557
01:24:17.098 --> 01:24:20.685
see. like. behind it. I guess.

1558
01:24:21.269 --> 01:24:23.063
[Director] I think a lot
depends on whose

1559
01:24:23.104 --> 01:24:25.231
eyes you're looking through.
Right?

1560
01:24:25.273 --> 01:24:27.275
Are we talking about a
white point of view

1561
01:24:27.317 --> 01:24:28.568
or a black point of view?

1562
01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:30.695
A lot depends on
who you are. I think.

1563
01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.783
- I want to know. like.
what was your perspective

1564
01:24:34.824 --> 01:24:38.495
of the whole
slavery situation and how you

1565
01:24:38.536 --> 01:24:42.207
feel like. because you you
know. you being. you were

1566
01:24:42.248 --> 01:24:46.419
raised. like how do you feel
when people--

1567
01:24:48.004 --> 01:24:49.881
[Director] I feel like
it was wrong.

1568
01:24:51.966 --> 01:24:54.719
I feel like it
was deeply wrong.

1569
01:24:56.805 --> 01:24:59.099
But I also feel like

1570
01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:01.726
I never learned about
slavery as a white story.

1571
01:25:03.019 --> 01:25:05.563
I mean. most people around me.
we never talk about slavery as

1572
01:25:05.605 --> 01:25:08.900
something white people did
and benefited from. you know?

1573
01:25:09.984 --> 01:25:11.069
It was always just presented

1574
01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:13.321
as something
that just happened.

1575
01:25:26.626 --> 01:25:28.837
[Dr. Blight] I want to introduce
Ibram Kendi.

1576
01:25:28.878 --> 01:25:31.089
Ibram. you argue
that the current

1577
01:25:31.131 --> 01:25:32.841
threat of racism is more

1578
01:25:32.882 --> 01:25:37.012
insidious now than it
has been in the past.

1579
01:25:37.053 --> 01:25:38.179
[Ibram] Precisely.

1580
01:25:38.221 --> 01:25:40.473
Just as Lincoln said

1581
01:25:40.515 --> 01:25:42.851
that the nation will either
become

1582
01:25:42.892 --> 01:25:44.477
all one or all the other.

1583
01:25:44.519 --> 01:25:46.479
meaning slavery
or antislavery.

1584
01:25:46.521 --> 01:25:50.525
I think it's the same thing
for racism and anti-racism.

1585
01:25:52.861 --> 01:25:57.657
If we see America's history
of steady racial progress

1586
01:25:57.699 --> 01:26:00.827
that we have now reached
the mountaintop.

1587
01:26:00.869 --> 01:26:04.873
racism is no longer
critical and important.

1588
01:26:06.082 --> 01:26:10.253
We're also saying the cause
of racial inequities today

1589
01:26:10.295 --> 01:26:13.340
is not racism. because
we've moved beyond racism.

1590
01:26:14.257 --> 01:26:15.842
It's the inferiority

1591
01:26:15.884 --> 01:26:19.387
of particular people that are
not working hard enough.

1592
01:26:20.305 --> 01:26:23.558
(introspective music)

1593
01:26:24.893 --> 01:26:28.688
There was a racist idea
that is still very prominent

1594
01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:31.733
within the community of people
who consider themselves

1595
01:26:31.775 --> 01:26:34.569
liberal. even progressive
or even radical.

1596
01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:37.906
The oppression
inferiority thesis.

1597
01:26:37.947 --> 01:26:41.117
First. it was slavery making
black people into brutes.

1598
01:26:41.159 --> 01:26:43.244
Right now. it's poverty.

1599
01:26:44.329 --> 01:26:47.540
This idea that racism itself

1600
01:26:47.582 --> 01:26:51.419
or discrimination
wasn't just sort of harming

1601
01:26:51.461 --> 01:26:55.840
people. but it was literally
leading to inferior behaviors.

1602
01:26:58.843 --> 01:27:01.596
(introspective music)

1603
01:27:14.943 --> 01:27:16.903
[Director] When you walk
down the street

1604
01:27:16.945 --> 01:27:18.530
and people see you.

1605
01:27:18.571 --> 01:27:20.240
what do you want people
to think about you?

1606
01:27:20.281 --> 01:27:21.700
Do you think about that ever?

1607
01:27:22.617 --> 01:27:24.327
- I want them to
think that I'm

1608
01:27:24.369 --> 01:27:28.123
an intelligent girl
and I'm not bad.

1609
01:27:28.164 --> 01:27:30.625
I'm actually very
good and I'm smart.

1610
01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:32.002
[Director] What makes
you a very good?

1611
01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:35.046
- That I follow directions.

1612
01:27:35.964 --> 01:27:37.507
Well. sometimes.

1613
01:27:37.549 --> 01:27:38.717
[Director] What else?

1614
01:27:39.467 --> 01:27:42.804
- Um. I want them to think
that I'm not ugly.

1615
01:27:44.055 --> 01:27:47.058
(quiet music)

1616
01:27:52.147 --> 01:27:53.523
[Director] It seems
to me that one

1617
01:27:53.565 --> 01:27:55.025
of the major challenges

1618
01:27:55.066 --> 01:27:58.445
for you was a history teacher
would be teaching in a way

1619
01:27:58.486 --> 01:28:00.989
that connects with such
a diverse student body.

1620
01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:02.949
- Yes.
Yeah. it is.

1621
01:28:04.325 --> 01:28:05.952
[Director] Boston Latin
is kind of like

1622
01:28:05.994 --> 01:28:07.245
the nation in miniature

1623
01:28:07.287 --> 01:28:08.455
because it is so old

1624
01:28:08.496 --> 01:28:10.040
and it did start as

1625
01:28:10.081 --> 01:28:12.959
a segregated all
male institution.

1626
01:28:13.001 --> 01:28:14.794
- Yeah. it's the oldest school

1627
01:28:14.836 --> 01:28:19.341
in the country.
Was founded in 1635 by

1628
01:28:19.382 --> 01:28:21.760
a portion of the population
of Boston. England.

1629
01:28:21.801 --> 01:28:23.678
It was all male.
was all white.

1630
01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:26.473
It was all
people of privilege.

1631
01:28:28.308 --> 01:28:29.601
[Director] You know.
I've really come

1632
01:28:29.642 --> 01:28:31.770
to believe that part
of the purpose of history is

1633
01:28:31.811 --> 01:28:33.521
to tell a story
that unites us.

1634
01:28:33.563 --> 01:28:35.482
- Yeah.
- But in order

1635
01:28:35.523 --> 01:28:38.651
for that story to work.
we have to see ourselves as

1636
01:28:38.693 --> 01:28:40.695
being in the same
boat to begin with.

1637
01:28:40.737 --> 01:28:42.197
- Yeah.

1638
01:28:42.238 --> 01:28:43.990
- We have to see ourselves as
connected to other people.

1639
01:28:44.032 --> 01:28:45.492
- I really agree.

1640
01:28:45.533 --> 01:28:47.452
[Director] So in your
class today.

1641
01:28:47.494 --> 01:28:48.995
how do you tell a story

1642
01:28:49.037 --> 01:28:52.499
that helps these kids see
themselves as connected to all

1643
01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:54.959
the diverse people
that surround them?

1644
01:28:55.001 --> 01:28:58.713
- Well. it's important to talk
about race and the history.

1645
01:28:58.755 --> 01:29:00.965
And I want kids to understand

1646
01:29:01.007 --> 01:29:03.927
that where we are today
has its roots in the past.

1647
01:29:03.968 --> 01:29:06.805
But it's really hard to convey
the full scope of the way

1648
01:29:06.846 --> 01:29:10.517
the history of this
country plays out today.

1649
01:29:10.558 --> 01:29:14.229
And I think it's really
difficult to talk about race.

1650
01:29:14.729 --> 01:29:17.524
How do you actually help kids

1651
01:29:17.565 --> 01:29:21.027
to be different than us.
our generation.

1652
01:29:21.069 --> 01:29:23.321
who doesn't really know
how to do this very well?

1653
01:29:23.363 --> 01:29:25.365
How do you.
the only way you do

1654
01:29:25.407 --> 01:29:27.784
that is by having them do it.

1655
01:29:27.826 --> 01:29:29.661
Ok. I want to know what went

1656
01:29:29.703 --> 01:29:32.205
into place after
reconstruction.

1657
01:29:32.247 --> 01:29:33.957
Look at integration

1658
01:29:33.998 --> 01:29:37.335
of schools. fair
treatment by juries.

1659
01:29:37.377 --> 01:29:38.795
Those are the kinds of things.

1660
01:29:38.837 --> 01:29:41.464
How are we doing now?
We'll put the school

1661
01:29:41.506 --> 01:29:43.591
segregation folks
in that corner.

1662
01:29:43.633 --> 01:29:46.761
We'll put the jury selection
folks in the back corner

1663
01:29:46.803 --> 01:29:50.807
- With the black voting race.
I found that the 15th

1664
01:29:50.849 --> 01:29:53.977
Amendment.
it gave African-American males

1665
01:29:54.019 --> 01:29:56.521
the right to vote.
but they kept finding

1666
01:29:56.563 --> 01:29:58.481
loopholes to keep
them from voting.

1667
01:29:58.523 --> 01:30:01.067
And today. 13 percent are

1668
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:04.612
prohibited from voting because
they have served in prison.

1669
01:30:06.281 --> 01:30:08.700
- Yeah?
- Ok. umm

1670
01:30:09.284 --> 01:30:11.619
well. I guess I'll say I guess

1671
01:30:11.661 --> 01:30:14.748
I think we're running out
of time. but I. I just think

1672
01:30:14.789 --> 01:30:20.045
talking about this is
really not helpful because

1673
01:30:22.547 --> 01:30:24.341
I mean. what it does is--
(school bell rings)

1674
01:30:24.382 --> 01:30:26.509
- Sit still.
- It puts people in an

1675
01:30:26.551 --> 01:30:29.679
unproductive
mindset. because what it does

1676
01:30:29.721 --> 01:30:32.766
is it makes white people feel
guilty and it makes black

1677
01:30:32.807 --> 01:30:35.185
people feel like victims.
- Don't go anywhere.

1678
01:30:35.226 --> 01:30:37.062
And I want to know

1679
01:30:37.103 --> 01:30:39.856
what people want to say back
to that. because I think it's

1680
01:30:39.898 --> 01:30:42.484
important that you have
a chance to say something.

1681
01:30:42.525 --> 01:30:44.152
So I'm going to go
with Andriana first.

1682
01:30:44.194 --> 01:30:45.528
- Like. if you're treated

1683
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:48.740
differently because of
something you can't change.

1684
01:30:48.782 --> 01:30:50.158
why wouldn't you be a victim?

1685
01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.451
Like you don't have to talk

1686
01:30:51.493 --> 01:30:53.578
about something
to feel a certain way.

1687
01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:56.164
[Student] Have you?
- Yes.

1688
01:30:56.206 --> 01:31:01.127
- So I see all these hands
and we had a bell.

1689
01:31:01.169 --> 01:31:03.046
And I'm so sorry that we're

1690
01:31:03.088 --> 01:31:05.799
going to have to stop this.
but we will pick this up.

1691
01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.842
Look right where you are.
See your hands in the air?

1692
01:31:07.884 --> 01:31:09.219
Put your hands in the air.

1693
01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.680
This is where we
start tomorrow.

1694
01:31:13.348 --> 01:31:14.599
[Director] How did you
feel about the

1695
01:31:14.641 --> 01:31:15.934
conversation in
Section 41 today?

1696
01:31:15.975 --> 01:31:17.185
(gasps)

1697
01:31:17.435 --> 01:31:19.521
(nervous laughter)

1698
01:31:19.562 --> 01:31:20.605
- Terrified.

1699
01:31:20.647 --> 01:31:22.565
- The idea I wanted
to dismantle

1700
01:31:22.607 --> 01:31:25.193
is that there's like a system

1701
01:31:26.403 --> 01:31:27.987
in a place

1702
01:31:28.029 --> 01:31:29.030
like

1703
01:31:30.281 --> 01:31:32.450
that like

1704
01:31:32.492 --> 01:31:34.202
benefits white people

1705
01:31:34.244 --> 01:31:41.084
and like has a negative
effect on black people.

1706
01:31:41.126 --> 01:31:43.253
- I don't want
to squash this child.

1707
01:31:43.294 --> 01:31:44.838
He's. you know.

1708
01:31:44.879 --> 01:31:50.635
bringing sincere.
you know. and rigourous.

1709
01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:55.015
He's I think the
word he used was

1710
01:31:55.265 --> 01:31:57.017
logic.

1711
01:31:57.058 --> 01:31:58.727
He's thinking about
it logically.

1712
01:31:58.768 --> 01:32:02.647
And logic says that there's
got to be a reason for that.

1713
01:32:02.689 --> 01:32:05.191
But he doesn't have an answer
when I say. you know.

1714
01:32:05.233 --> 01:32:08.611
so what might be the reason if
you think it's not systemic

1715
01:32:08.653 --> 01:32:11.823
racism that has caused this.
what what is the reason?

1716
01:32:11.865 --> 01:32:13.324
And he says. I don't know.

1717
01:32:13.366 --> 01:32:16.870
- You shouldn't have something
to blame your problems on.

1718
01:32:16.911 --> 01:32:18.538
And I don't think that's--

1719
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.123
I don't think that's
a good thing.

1720
01:32:20.165 --> 01:32:21.833
Asian-Americans here.

1721
01:32:21.875 --> 01:32:24.711
they have a hard time.
but they still succeed.

1722
01:32:24.753 --> 01:32:26.546
- That's going to be
continued tomorrow.

1723
01:32:26.588 --> 01:32:28.048
And I've got to spend my time

1724
01:32:28.089 --> 01:32:30.592
thinking tonight.
what am I going to say

1725
01:32:30.633 --> 01:32:34.054
that respects
how hard this kid is thinking

1726
01:32:34.095 --> 01:32:36.014
about these things.
which is exactly what I want

1727
01:32:36.056 --> 01:32:40.060
him to do and still push back
a little bit and say.

1728
01:32:40.101 --> 01:32:43.396
you know. so I think you're
missing some of the picture

1729
01:32:43.438 --> 01:32:46.191
here in a really
important way.

1730
01:32:48.943 --> 01:32:52.447
I gave you this document about
the Jim Crow era.

1731
01:32:52.489 --> 01:32:55.742
which was written by Michelle
Alexander in her book.

1732
01:32:55.784 --> 01:32:58.411
So as you're reading through
that. I want you thinking.

1733
01:32:58.453 --> 01:33:02.123
how did they recreate a lower
class based on race

1734
01:33:02.165 --> 01:33:03.625
after reconstruction?

1735
01:33:03.667 --> 01:33:06.461
- Black people in prison.
they auctioned off

1736
01:33:06.503 --> 01:33:09.214
the prisoners
to the highest bidder.

1737
01:33:09.255 --> 01:33:13.259
- There was a loophole about
slavery in the 13th Amendment.

1738
01:33:13.301 --> 01:33:15.303
Did anyone catch that?

1739
01:33:15.345 --> 01:33:16.596
- They outlawed slavery.

1740
01:33:16.638 --> 01:33:19.766
but it was fit
as a punishment for a crime.

1741
01:33:19.808 --> 01:33:23.186
- What she's trying to say is
that the criminal justice

1742
01:33:23.228 --> 01:33:27.565
system. it's literally like
the same thing as Jim Crow.

1743
01:33:27.607 --> 01:33:29.067
which is her point.

1744
01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:30.985
[Instructor] I think you would
say a new iteration of it.

1745
01:33:31.027 --> 01:33:32.987
That's what we're really
trying to look at.

1746
01:33:33.029 --> 01:33:35.907
is the ways
that that is still with us.

1747
01:33:35.949 --> 01:33:38.451
- That's assuming
Jim Crow has a--

1748
01:33:38.493 --> 01:33:39.577
[Instructor] A presence today?

1749
01:33:39.619 --> 01:33:41.204
- Yeah. that's your assumption.
- It is.

1750
01:33:41.246 --> 01:33:43.289
- That's not that's
not my assumption.

1751
01:33:43.331 --> 01:33:45.083
Asian-Americans are routinely

1752
01:33:45.125 --> 01:33:47.043
discriminated against when
applying for colleges.

1753
01:33:47.085 --> 01:33:48.211
They have to get about like

1754
01:33:48.253 --> 01:33:50.839
400 SAT points higher
than black people.

1755
01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.507
And also they're discriminated

1756
01:33:52.549 --> 01:33:54.050
against when they're
applying for jobs.

1757
01:33:54.092 --> 01:33:56.511
(school bell rings)
Your mind is so closed off

1758
01:33:56.553 --> 01:33:58.304
to certain ideas.
(students laugh)

1759
01:33:58.346 --> 01:33:59.597
- We'll continue.

1760
01:33:59.639 --> 01:34:01.307
We will continue.

1761
01:34:01.349 --> 01:34:04.352
I love that you hang in there.

1762
01:34:05.687 --> 01:34:07.981
- They're not willing to
consider certain ideas

1763
01:34:08.023 --> 01:34:09.649
because they've been taught to

1764
01:34:09.691 --> 01:34:12.736
[crosstalk]

1765
01:34:12.777 --> 01:34:15.280
- Yeah. but is the certain
idea that you're really

1766
01:34:15.321 --> 01:34:17.782
suggesting that Asians are
better than black people?

1767
01:34:17.824 --> 01:34:20.285
That's not what you're
really saying. is it?

1768
01:34:20.326 --> 01:34:21.578
- I mean.

1769
01:34:21.619 --> 01:34:24.205
I'm not saying they're
like inherently better.

1770
01:34:24.247 --> 01:34:27.000
I'm just saying their
situation is better right now.

1771
01:34:27.959 --> 01:34:30.128
- But what would you
attribute that to?

1772
01:34:31.046 --> 01:34:34.883
- Higher income.
higher representation

1773
01:34:34.924 --> 01:34:37.218
in colleges and in uhh--

1774
01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:39.262
- But why do you think
they have that?

1775
01:34:39.304 --> 01:34:41.473
And why do you think
black people don't?

1776
01:34:42.557 --> 01:34:45.018
- I don't know. I mean.
Asians are discriminated much

1777
01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:47.103
more in those areas
because--

1778
01:34:47.145 --> 01:34:49.147
- Than black people?
- Yes.

1779
01:34:49.898 --> 01:34:51.775
- We'll agree to disagree
on that point.

1780
01:34:51.816 --> 01:34:53.360
but we'll come back to it. Ok?

1781
01:34:53.401 --> 01:34:54.694
- Ok.
- All right.

1782
01:34:54.736 --> 01:34:56.821
- Well. I hope you. I
hope you look into that.

1783
01:34:56.863 --> 01:34:59.115
- I will look into it.
Good.

1784
01:34:59.157 --> 01:35:00.825
Thank you.

1785
01:35:02.035 --> 01:35:05.121
It's a revelation to me
that presenting.

1786
01:35:05.163 --> 01:35:09.084
no matter how much information
you present. sometimes

1787
01:35:09.125 --> 01:35:11.378
people are going to hear it
the way they want to hear it

1788
01:35:11.419 --> 01:35:14.381
and they're not going
to budge. at least not yet.

1789
01:35:14.422 --> 01:35:16.091
He's not.

1790
01:35:17.258 --> 01:35:20.887
But that's exactly what you're
in for when you open the door

1791
01:35:20.929 --> 01:35:22.931
to having these kinds
of conversations.

1792
01:35:22.972 --> 01:35:24.933
That's what's
hard to navigate.

1793
01:35:28.687 --> 01:35:31.231
(quiet music)

1794
01:35:47.288 --> 01:35:49.916
- We're celebrating
Confederate Heroes Day.

1795
01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:51.209
it's a Texas state holiday

1796
01:35:51.251 --> 01:35:53.628
celebrated on the 19th
of January every year.

1797
01:35:53.670 --> 01:35:56.256
which is also
Robert E. Lee's birthday.

1798
01:35:56.297 --> 01:35:59.009
- The bill was filed by a
representative from Pensacola.

1799
01:35:59.050 --> 01:36:01.219
It says that a memorial can't

1800
01:36:01.261 --> 01:36:03.972
be moved unless it needs
to be refurbished.

1801
01:36:04.014 --> 01:36:05.849
- This monument right here

1802
01:36:05.890 --> 01:36:08.435
outside the old courthouse
in downtown Pittsboro was

1803
01:36:08.476 --> 01:36:10.103
given to the county by the

1804
01:36:10.145 --> 01:36:13.023
Daughters of the Confederacy
back in the early 1900's.

1805
01:36:13.064 --> 01:36:15.316
- I'm in favor of the
statues staying.

1806
01:36:16.359 --> 01:36:20.321
A lot of ancestors of mine
had fought and died.

1807
01:36:20.613 --> 01:36:23.366
And they didn't
die for slavery.

1808
01:36:24.367 --> 01:36:25.827
They had no slaves.

1809
01:36:25.869 --> 01:36:27.620
(applause)

1810
01:36:28.163 --> 01:36:32.250
(crowd chanting and yelling)

1811
01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:35.420
[Crowd] Pull! Pull!

1812
01:36:40.258 --> 01:36:44.888
(crowd yelling and cheering)

1813
01:36:57.609 --> 01:36:59.611
(applause)

1814
01:37:01.446 --> 01:37:04.824
- Story starts with seeing
the monuments.

1815
01:37:04.866 --> 01:37:07.535
but it's also about being
in this black body.

1816
01:37:07.577 --> 01:37:09.871
What does that feel like
to have your country.

1817
01:37:09.913 --> 01:37:13.291
your nation say this
is what we stand by?

1818
01:37:13.333 --> 01:37:17.420
No. We want more.
we demand more.

1819
01:37:17.962 --> 01:37:21.174
We say yes to something
that looks like us.

1820
01:37:21.216 --> 01:37:23.426
We say yes to inclusivity.

1821
01:37:25.053 --> 01:37:28.264
We say yes to broader notions

1822
01:37:28.306 --> 01:37:30.058
of what it means
to be an American.

1823
01:37:33.436 --> 01:37:36.398
(dramatic music)

1824
01:37:50.578 --> 01:37:53.915
(dramatic music)
