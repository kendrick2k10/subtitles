00:21:00.427 --> 00:21:01.193
- I don't know.

302
00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:04.230
My mom always said I
had champion genes.

303
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.332
- Did you get the shot?

304
00:21:05.332 --> 00:21:06.165

305
00:21:06.165 --> 00:21:07.133

Neither did anybody
get the diner.

But you've been bitten.
so why aren't you sick?

308
00:21:14.106 --> 00:21:14.941
- I don't know.

309
00:21:16.075 --> 00:21:17.577
My mom she's a scientist

310
00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:21.047
and when I was little. she
was always giving me shots.

311
00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:23.249
Maybe that had
something to do with it.

312
00:21:23.249 --> 00:21:25.051
I really don't know.

313
00:21:25.051 --> 00:21:26.453
- Okay well. if you're
bitten and you're not sick

314
00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:28.355
then someone needs
to know about this.

315
00:21:34.694 --> 00:21:36.929
I may be able to
get you to your mom.

316
00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:38.365
There's a car up
behind the diner

317
00:21:38.365 --> 00:21:41.434
it belongs to the owners
cook. but he's one of them now

318
00:21:41.434 --> 00:21:42.635
so he won't be using it.

319
00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:45.872
I'll take you with
me on one condition.

320
00:21:47.106 --> 00:21:49.809
You don't tell everybody
that you've been bitten.

321
00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.611
They'll flip their
shit if they know.

322
00:21:52.712 --> 00:21:57.684
- Okay.

323
00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:02.622

331
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.361

00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:15.642
- Great. another mouth to feed.

374
00:26:15.642 --> 00:26:17.309
She seems okay Roy

375
00:26:17.309 --> 00:26:20.579
Remember that bitch who
sunk her teeth into our dog.

376
00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:22.982
Or did you forget about
that already. honey pie?

377
00:26:24.183 --> 00:26:27.153
You show one side
of the sickness

378
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.357
and I will end your day.

379
00:26:31.357 --> 00:26:32.524
You hear?

380
00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:34.661
- Don't be so
overdramatic. honey.

381
00:26:34.661 --> 00:26:36.095
- She's fine. Roy...

382
00:26:36.095 --> 00:26:39.666
- Shut your cake hole.
Emma. this is Roy's Island.

383
00:26:40.733 --> 00:26:42.001
Roy makes the rules.

384
00:26:42.001 --> 00:26:45.437
And the only rule is do
whatever the hell I say.

385
00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.774
- Chill Mr. Temer.
you're scaring Grace.

386
00:26:47.774 --> 00:26:50.476
- But she's made it this
far. that's say something.

387
00:26:52.144 --> 00:26:55.447
- Roy didn't have to
let a single one of you

388
00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:59.051
free loaders stay
here. remember that.

389
00:26:59.051 --> 00:27:01.087
- Is he referring himself
in the third person?

390
00:27:01.087 --> 00:27:02.454
- Yeah. he does that a lot?

391
00:27:03.756 --> 00:27:05.958
- Man. one more time
ain't gonna hurt.

392
00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:08.995
- It's gonna hurt when you
run out of Roy's food and H2O.

393
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:12.331
- I'll give her
some of my Saltines.

394
00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:15.668
- A sucker going
every Goddamn minute.

395
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:19.171
I'm gonna go and
re-check the stockroom.

396
00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:21.841
If I find one can out of place.

397
00:27:23.009 --> 00:27:25.177
I'm throwin' the two
of you to the wolves.

398
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.248
- Don't mind him.

399
00:27:29.248 --> 00:27:31.050
This whole thing's has
got him testier than usual.

400
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:33.619
- Hope he didn't scare you.

401
00:27:35.621 --> 00:27:36.956
I'm Martha.

402
00:27:36.956 --> 00:27:38.991
This is my husband. Fred.

403
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:40.626
- Everybody calls me Red.

404
00:27:40.626 --> 00:27:41.961
- Hey

405
00:27:41.961 --> 00:27:44.263
- Jesse doesn't scare easily.

406
00:27:44.263 --> 00:27:46.598
Oh well. you lived this long.

407
00:27:46.598 --> 00:27:48.534
you've seen just
about everything.

408
00:27:49.535 --> 00:27:52.238
But the one's out there now.

409
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:56.408
Well. that's a
new on me and red.

410
00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:04.450
- You. made this far
without a fella out there?

411
00:28:06.719 --> 00:28:08.154
- Yeah.

412
00:28:08.154 --> 00:28:09.321
- Impress-eev-oh.

413
00:28:11.023 --> 00:28:12.959
- He doesn't mean
any disrespect.

414
00:28:12.959 --> 00:28:17.029
He's old-fashioned.
set in his ways.

415
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:18.464
- It's okay.

416
00:28:18.464 --> 00:28:20.466
I can see you got
yourself so help too.

417
00:28:22.134 --> 00:28:27.106
So. you guys just been cooped
up in here. just waiting?

418
00:28:27.106 --> 00:28:28.640
- What do you want us to do?

419
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.242
I mean. at least nobody
is looking for us

420
00:28:30.242 --> 00:28:31.510
in this shithole.

421
00:28:36.448 --> 00:28:38.785
- Fred and I are too old
to go anywhere anyway.

422
00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:43.189
- Jesse and I are
gonna get some help.

423
00:28:45.424 --> 00:28:47.894
- It's too dangerous
to go anywhere.

424
00:28:47.894 --> 00:28:48.828
- I gotta get home.

425
00:28:50.162 --> 00:28:52.064
- You got somebody
waiting for you?

426
00:28:53.432 --> 00:28:54.666
- Hope so. mom.

427
00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:59.038
- Yeah. good luck
going in alone.

428
00:28:59.038 --> 00:29:02.741
I mean you go out there.
get ourselves killed.

429
00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:05.211
Hey. I'd rather starve
to death in here.

430
00:29:05.211 --> 00:29:07.613
than get my juggler
chomed out there.

431
00:29:10.016 --> 00:29:11.818
Sorry. kid. Mea Culpa?

432
00:29:15.922 --> 00:29:16.956
- What do you say. Grace?

433
00:29:16.956 --> 00:29:17.924
- Thank you.

434
00:29:17.924 --> 00:29:18.757
- We good?

435
00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:26.265
- So you must be Mark's sister?

436
00:29:28.267 --> 00:29:29.635
Your brother's really brave.

437
00:29:29.635 --> 00:29:31.070
- He always takes care of me.

438
00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:34.773
- My mom's the same.

439
00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:39.145
Does anyone know the quickest
way to get to Atlanta

440
00:29:39.145 --> 00:29:40.880
from here?

441
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.682
- Take the highway
West. 190 miles or so

442
00:29:43.682 --> 00:29:46.418
get you in the vicinity.

443
00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.656
- So where are your parents?

444
00:29:51.657 --> 00:29:53.092
We don't know?

445
00:29:53.092 --> 00:29:56.128
- I found them in a State
park a few days ago.

446
00:29:56.128 --> 00:29:57.029
- We were resting.

447
00:29:57.997 --> 00:29:59.331
We're not from around here.

448
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.604
My uncle is some survivalist
nut job. at least.

449
00:30:05.604 --> 00:30:09.308
I thought he was a nut job until
all this started happening.

450
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.645
Last time I saw him. I
was around eight or nine.

451
00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:14.847
Grace has never met him.

452
00:30:15.982 --> 00:30:17.917
He has a farm just
outside of Rose city.

453
00:30:17.917 --> 00:30:20.819
We were headed there
when we got held up here.

454
00:30:23.022 --> 00:30:24.656
- All right Miss Thang.

455
00:30:25.858 --> 00:30:28.727
Let me lay down
the rules for ya.

456
00:30:28.727 --> 00:30:32.464
One. I decide when
you're thirsty.

457
00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:37.836
Two. I decide when
you're hungry. kapeesh?

458
00:30:39.638 --> 00:30:43.642
Oh. you don't
wanna make friends.

459
00:30:43.642 --> 00:30:48.614
It's a cold hard world out
there. pays to make friends.

460
00:30:50.983 --> 00:30:52.484
See old Red here.

461
00:30:52.484 --> 00:30:55.021
didn't think I noticed he swiped

462
00:30:55.021 --> 00:30:57.924
that extra bottle
of water last night.

463
00:30:57.924 --> 00:30:58.824
Did you Red?

464
00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:04.163
You can't even piss
it out old man.

465
00:31:05.965 --> 00:31:07.433
So why bother?

466
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.401
- You're evil.

467
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:11.003
- You know. you talk too much.

468
00:31:11.003 --> 00:31:15.007
- And your mouth just as big
as your belly. full of shit.

469
00:31:15.007 --> 00:31:16.508
- I've been more than fair.

470
00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:19.278
- Roy's just looking
out for everyone.

471
00:31:19.278 --> 00:31:20.579
he's protecting us.

472
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.883
- See. sweet piece
of pussy shows up.

473
00:31:25.851 --> 00:31:27.319
suddenly we got a mutiny?

474
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.957
Y'all had best settle down

475
00:31:30.957 --> 00:31:33.859
if you wanna keep enjoying
Roy's hospitality.

476
00:31:37.096 --> 00:31:39.431
Rather die than take
anything from him again

477
00:31:54.313 --> 00:31:55.281
- Are we on?

478
00:31:55.281 --> 00:31:56.415
Are we live?

479
00:31:56.415 --> 00:31:57.649
Okay. good.

480
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:59.185
Listen. I don't
know how much longer

481
00:31:59.185 --> 00:32:00.919
we're gonna be
able to broadcast.

482
00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:02.488
This may be our last report.

483
00:32:02.488 --> 00:32:04.690
We have just received
word that the sickness

484
00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.993
that has spread
is a direct result

485
00:32:06.993 --> 00:32:09.395
of the C100 flu vaccine.

486
00:32:09.395 --> 00:32:12.831
This is apparently some sort
of mutation of a dead virus

487
00:32:12.831 --> 00:32:15.934
that has been used to
inoculate millions of people

488
00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:18.437
with horrific results.

489
00:32:18.437 --> 00:32:22.341
The gestation period
from post inoculation

490
00:32:22.341 --> 00:32:25.311
to when symptoms present
is anywhere from one week

491
00:32:25.311 --> 00:32:27.879
to less than 24 hours.

492
00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:32.151
If you received the
vaccine. you have the virus.

493
00:32:32.151 --> 00:32:33.485
This bears repeating.

494
00:32:33.485 --> 00:32:34.753
If you got a flu shot.

495
00:32:34.753 --> 00:32:36.288
you are infected.
- What Bear's repeating

496
00:32:36.288 --> 00:32:39.391
is this. the government is
always fucking things up.

497
00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:40.726
They keep trying to
do the same thing.

498
00:32:40.726 --> 00:32:42.494
but in different ways.

499
00:32:42.494 --> 00:32:46.532
Hey. don't mess with
what ain't yours.

500
00:32:46.532 --> 00:32:49.101
(somber music)

501
00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:56.075
Attack your shit for brain.

502
00:32:56.075 --> 00:32:59.945
- Man. the only thing I want
attacking my brain is this.

503
00:33:04.216 --> 00:33:07.253
You ask me. I've
seen it coming. man.

504
00:33:07.253 --> 00:33:11.623
I mean. tsunamis. earthquakes
all over the world.

505
00:33:11.623 --> 00:33:13.092
famine. drought.

506
00:33:13.092 --> 00:33:15.661
- Surprise it didn't
happen sooner.

507
00:33:15.661 --> 00:33:19.031
(spooky music)

508
00:33:19.031 --> 00:33:21.467
- I never thought I'd
see the end of the world.

509
00:33:21.467 --> 00:33:24.036
- Wasn't world has
been falling apart.

510
00:33:24.036 --> 00:33:26.004
We've been falling apart.

511
00:33:27.373 --> 00:33:29.041
From the inside.

512
00:33:29.041 --> 00:33:31.043
- don't talk that way.

513
00:33:31.043 --> 00:33:34.913
I'm sure the president
is doing something.

514
00:33:35.981 --> 00:33:38.317
- Unless virus got him too.

515
00:33:38.317 --> 00:33:40.886
(somber music)

516
00:33:44.356 --> 00:33:45.657
- What are you looking at?

517
00:33:48.794 --> 00:33:49.728
Insulin.

518
00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:50.562
- [Lucy] Roy's got the diabetes.

519
00:33:52.231 --> 00:33:53.232
- Shut up Lucy.

520
00:33:55.534 --> 00:33:58.304
* Bake me. cake as
fast as you can *

521
00:33:58.304 --> 00:34:01.607
* Pat it. prick it.
mark it with a B *

522
00:34:01.607 --> 00:34:05.577
* Put it in the oven
for a baby and me *

523
00:34:05.577 --> 00:34:06.478
- You know what that means?

524
00:34:06.478 --> 00:34:07.746
- No.

525
00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:09.047
- The Pat it and prick
it. Mark it with a B?

526
00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:14.553
So in the olden days. the Baker
would bake all of the bread

527
00:34:14.553 --> 00:34:16.255
for all people in the town.

528
00:34:16.255 --> 00:34:18.724
And he would mark the top of
the bread with the toothpick

529
00:34:18.724 --> 00:34:21.693
with the first letter of
the last name of the family.

530
00:34:21.693 --> 00:34:24.396
So they knew it was there so
when they came to pick it up.

531
00:34:24.396 --> 00:34:27.199
The bakery was like
a communal oven.

532
00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:28.199
- What's a communal?

533
00:34:29.368 --> 00:34:33.472
- A communal means.
well. it's kinda like

534
00:34:33.472 --> 00:34:35.474
what we're doing
here in the diner.

535
00:34:35.474 --> 00:34:37.275
Like we're all living together.

536
00:34:37.275 --> 00:34:40.045
taking care of each other
the best we can. right?

537
00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.313
- Mm-hm.

538
00:34:47.253 --> 00:34:48.085
- You okay?

539
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:51.989
- Yes.

540
00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:53.259
Makes me miss my mom.

541
00:34:54.626 --> 00:34:56.295
- Yeah?

542
00:34:56.295 --> 00:34:57.196
Tell me about her.

543
00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:01.867
- She's smart and successful.

544
00:35:01.867 --> 00:35:06.572
She has a career working for
a pharmaceutical company.

545
00:35:06.572 --> 00:35:09.440
She's pretty much
the opposite of me.

546
00:35:10.309 --> 00:35:11.777
- Now you sell yourself short.

547
00:35:13.212 --> 00:35:15.614
- Maybe she has some kind
of idea of what's going on?

548
00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:17.716
- I don't know.

549
00:35:17.716 --> 00:35:19.985
Just wanna get back to her.

550
00:35:22.321 --> 00:35:23.955
I need the keys to the car.

551
00:35:25.791 --> 00:35:27.259
- I think Roy has them.

552
00:35:28.194 --> 00:35:31.563
(lights buzzing)

553
00:35:31.563 --> 00:35:32.398
- What happened?

554
00:35:32.398 --> 00:35:33.399
- What was that?

555
00:35:33.399 --> 00:35:35.501
- Nothing. don't worry about it.

556
00:35:35.501 --> 00:35:37.469
- We gotta go back and
check the generator.

557
00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:39.371
Those things must've
bumped into it again.

558
00:35:39.371 --> 00:35:41.306
- In the morning
honey. do it then.

559
00:35:41.306 --> 00:35:43.509
- We gotta to keep this place
cool for the meat in the back

560
00:35:43.509 --> 00:35:45.076
and for my insulin.

561
00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:46.844
- Time for TV?

562
00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:49.448
If the news comes back on.

563
00:35:49.448 --> 00:35:52.050
- Anyone steals from
me while I'm gone.

564
00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:56.288
and I swear to God. that
includes you denture Dick.

565
00:35:56.288 --> 00:35:57.889
Come on kid. you
gotta watch my ass.

566
00:35:57.889 --> 00:35:58.824
You too Brandon.

567
00:35:58.824 --> 00:35:59.725
- I'll go.

568
00:35:59.725 --> 00:36:00.559
- What?

569
00:36:00.559 --> 00:36:01.860
- I said. I'll go.

570
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.961
Stay with your sister.

571
00:36:04.196 --> 00:36:07.766
- All right. kid.
you go babysit.

572
00:36:07.766 --> 00:36:10.068
Miss Thang is going daddy bear.

573
00:36:13.472 --> 00:36:14.973
- She'll be back.

574
00:36:14.973 --> 00:36:15.807
Don't worry.

575
00:36:18.377 --> 00:36:21.146
(door squeaking)

576
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.052
(spooky music)

577
00:36:31.323 --> 00:36:32.157
- Shit!

578
00:36:33.959 --> 00:36:36.562
(spooky music)

579
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.167
- Where are they?

580
00:36:46.605 --> 00:36:49.608
- I don't know. maybe the
smell of Roy's scared them off.

581
00:36:49.608 --> 00:36:51.443
- Shut up. come on.

582
00:36:51.443 --> 00:36:54.045
(spooky music)

583
00:36:55.781 --> 00:36:58.850
The one time they
took out the trash.

584
00:37:02.354 --> 00:37:06.091
You know Miss Thang.
I like your spunk.

585
00:37:07.493 --> 00:37:09.861
I don't even know why I
bothered with everyone else.

586
00:37:11.029 --> 00:37:12.831
It's like they think
I owe them something.

587
00:37:13.665 --> 00:37:15.667
As far as I'm concerned.

588
00:37:15.667 --> 00:37:18.604
Emma doesn't even
work for me anymore.

589
00:37:18.604 --> 00:37:21.139
And I don't believe that
the customer is always right

590
00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:22.274
applies neither.

591
00:37:23.709 --> 00:37:28.314
Is not in a situation like
this and that old fuck.

592
00:37:28.314 --> 00:37:31.583
he can roll over dead too
as far as I'm concerned.

593
00:37:31.583 --> 00:37:32.818
(generator rolling)
- Come on man.

594
00:37:32.818 --> 00:37:33.619
Hey. can you just hurry
up and fix that thing

595
00:37:33.619 --> 00:37:35.086
so we get back inside.

596
00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:36.688
even know what your man?

597
00:37:36.688 --> 00:37:39.958
- I installed this generator
myself. you whiny ass bitch.

598
00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:40.859
- Yeah. whatever.

599
00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.729
- I appreciate you
taking me in Roy.

600
00:37:45.697 --> 00:37:48.300
(laughing)

601
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:53.305
- See. that's all I ask
for. a little bit of respect

602
00:37:54.172 --> 00:37:55.774
and maybe a wee bit of thanks.

603
00:37:58.344 --> 00:37:59.978
- Oh shit!

604
00:37:59.978 --> 00:38:00.812
(growling)

605
00:38:00.812 --> 00:38:03.114
(screaming)

606
00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:09.988
(dramatic music)

607
00:38:14.092 --> 00:38:16.728
(gun shot firing)

608
00:38:16.728 --> 00:38:18.864
- No contact with
the customers bitch.

609
00:38:18.864 --> 00:38:19.665
- Roy!

610
00:38:20.599 --> 00:38:21.433
- Lucy!

611
00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.036
- I hope he's dead.

612
00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:26.505
- Dammit Fred!

613
00:38:26.505 --> 00:38:28.840
(screaming)

614
00:38:31.643 --> 00:38:33.879
(mumbling)

615
00:38:37.883 --> 00:38:39.751
- [Woman] Cry!

616
00:38:39.751 --> 00:38:42.320
(spooky music)

617
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.867
- Take us with you.

618
00:38:55.867 --> 00:38:57.002
- What?

619
00:38:57.002 --> 00:38:57.903
No. I can't.

620
00:38:59.037 --> 00:39:00.539
- My uncle's place
is just along the way

621
00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:01.773
of wherever you're going.

622
00:39:03.942 --> 00:39:06.812
- Roy wasn't right
about a lot of things.

623
00:39:06.812 --> 00:39:08.780
but he was right about
us sticking together.

624
00:39:09.748 --> 00:39:11.049
- And stick together here.

625
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.785
You're safer here
than on the road.

626
00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:15.487
- Hey. I wanna go too.

627
00:39:15.487 --> 00:39:18.757
I mean. if this thing that
hasn't gotten a hold on you yet.

628
00:39:18.757 --> 00:39:20.692
maybe you're just
a thing to stop it.

629
00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:23.128
(cool music)

630
00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:31.102
- Roy was lucky to have you.

631
00:39:34.506 --> 00:39:37.709
- Yo. we buggin'. if you
know you wanna join us.

632
00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:39.845
- Take some supplies
too. we won't need them.

633
00:39:39.845 --> 00:39:43.181
- There's not much room. but
if you want to come with us.

634
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:45.083
- It don't seem
worth it without Roy.

635
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.323
You go on. save the world.

636
00:39:52.323 --> 00:39:53.792
There's a world left to save.

637
00:39:57.496 --> 00:39:58.997
Go. while you can.

638
00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:06.304
(whispering)

639
00:40:09.107 --> 00:40:13.612
- We're gonna see it through
right here with Lucy here.

640
00:40:17.215 --> 00:40:18.984
Martha woke up feeling sick.

641
00:40:20.452 --> 00:40:21.553
Jerky didn't sit well.

642
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:26.992
- Thank you. Red.

643
00:40:30.796 --> 00:40:33.231
Martha. you'll
feel better. okay?

644
00:40:38.036 --> 00:40:40.171
(gasping)

645
00:40:52.818 --> 00:40:54.753
- You know how to
use one of these?

646
00:40:54.753 --> 00:40:57.422
- I may have learned on
flintlock. but I'll manage.

647
00:41:08.033 --> 00:41:10.769
- [Emma] All right.
come on guys.

648
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:17.242
(spooky music)

649
00:41:33.825 --> 00:41:34.926
- How many bullets.

650
00:41:34.926 --> 00:41:37.495
(spooky music)

651
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.539
- Won't you know it. two.

652
00:41:50.809 --> 00:41:53.845
(car engine roaring)

653
00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.823
(spooky music)

654
00:42:07.092 --> 00:42:08.326
(gunshot)

655
00:42:08.326 --> 00:42:10.896
(spooky music)

656
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.335
- Atlanta song's fine to me.

657
00:42:17.335 --> 00:42:20.706
Maybe catch some grits
and greens and stuff.

658
00:42:20.706 --> 00:42:21.539
You?

659
00:42:22.874 --> 00:42:25.443
- Nope. everyone I knew
is dead or infected. so.

660
00:42:26.678 --> 00:42:29.147
- Everybody keeps
saying infected.

661
00:42:29.147 --> 00:42:32.183
I mean. that's
just how it starts.

662
00:42:32.183 --> 00:42:36.021
I mean. you get bit. you
die and you bite. period.

663
00:42:37.155 --> 00:42:39.324
Unless you're Jesse.
the wonder girl.

664
00:42:40.726 --> 00:42:42.828
Other than that. you gotta
bash some brains man.

665
00:42:44.095 --> 00:42:45.430
Ain't that right Marky Mark?

666
00:42:46.832 --> 00:42:50.001
You my man. are a
bonafide Thumper.

667
00:42:51.202 --> 00:42:53.104
Man. hey. I saw
what you did to them

668
00:42:53.104 --> 00:42:55.573
Zombies to get into
to that diner.

669
00:42:55.573 --> 00:42:57.643
(laughing)

670
00:42:57.643 --> 00:43:02.547
- If you die after you get
bit. your soul is taken. right?

671
00:43:03.615 --> 00:43:06.517
The body is just a shell.

672
00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:10.689
- No. your body becomes a
virus spreading machine.

673
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:13.792
Your soul has nothing
to do with it.

674
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.528
What kind of God
who creates souls

675
00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:20.365
will let something terrible
like this happen anyway?

676
00:43:21.399 --> 00:43:23.635
Maybe we pissed him off

677
00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:27.038
I don't believe in God.

678
00:43:27.038 --> 00:43:28.874
I believe in scientists.

679
00:43:28.874 --> 00:43:30.341
Scientists that go messing

680
00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:32.644
when they ain't got
no business messing.

681
00:43:32.644 --> 00:43:35.613
- If you have God.
you have everything.

682
00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:38.249
Without God. we have nothing.

683
00:43:40.218 --> 00:43:44.455
- Yeah. well what
do we got now Mark?

684
00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:46.257
Everything's gone bro.

685
00:43:47.893 --> 00:43:49.560
- I have everything.

686
00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.296
- So you don't have
anywhere to be?

687
00:43:52.397 --> 00:43:53.231
No family?

688
00:43:55.667 --> 00:43:56.567
- No one claim me.

689
00:43:58.369 --> 00:43:59.504
I'm a bastards kid.

690
00:44:00.672 --> 00:44:03.541
My dad left my mom
before I even knew him.

691
00:44:04.876 --> 00:44:07.846
And so she's so upset.

692
00:44:07.846 --> 00:44:10.315
She don't even
like to look at me.

693
00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:11.950
'Cause I'm the
bastard's bastard.

694
00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:14.185
- I'm sorry.

695
00:44:15.854 --> 00:44:17.422
- No need to be.

696
00:44:17.422 --> 00:44:20.091
Hey. that's the way
the cards were dealt.

697
00:44:20.091 --> 00:44:21.592
What you gonna do?

698
00:44:26.698 --> 00:44:29.167
- We need take 285
just a little bit.

699
00:44:30.301 --> 00:44:31.102
- Got it.

700
00:44:34.072 --> 00:44:37.608
- Hey. Mark man. we need
to make a supply run bro.

701
00:44:38.543 --> 00:44:40.478
One like a bourbon run.

702
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.018
(car engine roaring)

703
00:44:47.018 --> 00:44:47.853
- [Emma] That's Megan.

704
00:44:47.853 --> 00:44:48.686
- [Jesse] Who?

705
00:44:48.686 --> 00:44:49.520
- [Emma] My sister.

706
00:44:50.956 --> 00:44:51.790
Megan?

707
00:44:54.359 --> 00:44:56.094
Meg. what happened to you?

708
00:44:56.094 --> 00:44:57.996
Answer me.

709
00:44:57.996 --> 00:44:59.965
- We almost made it out

710
00:44:59.965 --> 00:45:02.600
(spooky music)

711
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:03.935
- You're scaring me.

712
00:45:05.303 --> 00:45:07.072
What does that mean?

713
00:45:07.072 --> 00:45:10.008
Megan. what does that mean?

714
00:45:11.476 --> 00:45:14.746
- John took Rachael. there
was nothing I could do.

715
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:17.315
- Megan. Megan.

716
00:45:19.117 --> 00:45:20.551
No. no. no. wait-

717
00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:22.821
(growling)

718
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:27.058
(screaming)

719
00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.562
(somber music)

720
00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:35.466
- We need to go.

721
00:45:35.466 --> 00:45:37.535
(crying)

722
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.812
- Come on come on come on!

723
00:45:48.814 --> 00:45:53.018
- [Mark] Emma. I'm so sorry
about how this all ended.

724
00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:55.686
(spooky music)

725
00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:58.223
- This whole thing is a
living. breathing nightmare.

726
00:45:58.223 --> 00:46:00.225
- [Brandon] Come on.
get this thing started.

727
00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:01.459
- Are you okay?

728
00:46:01.459 --> 00:46:03.061
- You know you remind
me of my niece.

729
00:46:03.061 --> 00:46:04.262
(car engine roaring)

730
00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:06.564
She was just a child.
and just as sweet.

731
00:46:06.564 --> 00:46:07.866
- [Mark] Emma get in the car.

732
00:46:09.334 --> 00:46:12.170
- If I had kids I'd just like
them to be as the two of you.

733
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.538
(car engine roaring)

734
00:46:13.538 --> 00:46:14.906
- [Brandon] Emma come
on. get in the car.

735
00:46:14.906 --> 00:46:16.441
- Emma. Emma. come back!

736
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:17.308
Emma!

737
00:46:17.308 --> 00:46:19.544
(shouting)

738
00:46:22.814 --> 00:46:25.150
(screaming)

739
00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.090
(car screeching)

740
00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:40.765
(car engine roaring)

741
00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:46.938
(spooky music)

742
00:46:50.275 --> 00:46:53.378
(car engine roaring)

743
00:46:59.384 --> 00:47:01.920
(spooky music)

744
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:22.207
(dramatic music)

745
00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:31.049
(gunshot)

746
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:33.851
- [Mark] Stay in the car!

747
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:36.654
(screaming)

748
00:47:36.654 --> 00:47:38.556
Brandon. Brandon!

749
00:47:38.556 --> 00:47:40.725
(gunshot)

750
00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:43.294
Brandon. come on.

751
00:47:44.462 --> 00:47:45.796
Come on Brandon.

752
00:47:47.298 --> 00:47:48.733
- Oh shit!

753
00:47:48.733 --> 00:47:49.935
Just get out. save yourself!

754
00:47:49.935 --> 00:47:52.070
- [Mark] No. Brandon no.

755
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.339
- [Brandon] You need to
getting go. save yourself.

756
00:47:54.339 --> 00:47:55.773
- [Mark] Brandon!

757
00:47:55.773 --> 00:47:56.908
Go. go. get to the car.

758
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.713
- Come on motherfuckers.
is that all you got?

759
00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:04.950
(growling)

760
00:48:18.263 --> 00:48:20.831
(spooky music)

761
00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:24.970
(growling)

762
00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:33.811
(car tires screeching)

763
00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:52.830
(spooky music)

764
00:49:12.317 --> 00:49:15.386
(car engine roaring)

765
00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:31.502
- What are you doing?

766
00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.975
(gun corking)

767
00:49:37.975 --> 00:49:40.845
(gunshot)

768
00:49:40.845 --> 00:49:43.614
- Sorry. I know you believe
in that kind of shit.

769
00:49:43.614 --> 00:49:47.118
but maybe Brandon's right.

770
00:49:47.118 --> 00:49:48.986
What kind of God
will let this happen.

771
00:49:48.986 --> 00:49:51.522
to Sarah to Emma. to
Brandon. to anyone?

772
00:49:51.522 --> 00:49:54.659
- I didn't say it made
sense. it doesn't.

773
00:49:54.659 --> 00:49:56.494
Emma and Brandon
were my friends too.

774
00:49:59.397 --> 00:50:01.599
All I know everything
happens for a reason.

775
00:50:03.601 --> 00:50:06.637
- I turned to speak to God
about the world's despair.

776
00:50:06.637 --> 00:50:10.341
but to make bad matters worse.
I found God wasn't there.

777
00:50:12.243 --> 00:50:13.178
- What is that?

778
00:50:14.579 --> 00:50:17.082
- Something that my mom used
to say when my dad died.

779
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.051
Maybe she was right.

780
00:50:24.655 --> 00:50:25.790
I'm sorry. Grace.

781
00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:31.229
- My uncle's place should
be just up this road.

782
00:50:36.934 --> 00:50:39.970
(car engine roaring)

783
00:51:08.633 --> 00:51:10.901
(coughing)

784
00:51:18.943 --> 00:51:20.211
- Okay Grace. come on.

785
00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.482
Run. run. this way.

786
00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:28.353
Run.

787
00:51:28.353 --> 00:51:29.287
Grace. Lyrics

788
00:51:29.287 --> 00:51:31.356
You better walk fast okay?

789
00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:37.928
(growling)

790
00:51:54.679 --> 00:51:56.947
- This is far
enough. you can go.

791
00:51:58.216 --> 00:51:59.016
- I am Leaving her.

792
00:52:00.251 --> 00:52:01.652
- You don't have to do this.

793
00:52:01.652 --> 00:52:03.588
- Enough People have
died on my watch.

794
00:52:03.588 --> 00:52:04.455
I'm coming with.

795
00:52:09.627 --> 00:52:10.828
(growling)

796
00:52:10.828 --> 00:52:11.896
Guys. go. go!

797
00:52:13.097 --> 00:52:15.366
(growling)

798
00:52:17.268 --> 00:52:19.069
- [Mark] Okay. go. go.

799
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.904
Come on.

800
00:52:20.871 --> 00:52:22.507
It's okay. its okay.

801
00:52:22.507 --> 00:52:24.609
Here. here. come on. come on!

802
00:52:24.609 --> 00:52:26.244
Hurry hurry!

803
00:52:26.244 --> 00:52:28.479
(growling)

804
00:52:29.747 --> 00:52:31.349
Watch Grace for me.

805
00:52:32.317 --> 00:52:35.386
(growling)

806
00:52:35.386 --> 00:52:37.188
Come on. let's go.

807
00:52:37.188 --> 00:52:39.424
(growling)

808
00:53:04.148 --> 00:53:06.551
(gunshot)

809
00:53:06.551 --> 00:53:08.386
- Come on. over there!

810
00:53:11.522 --> 00:53:13.791
(growling)

811
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:34.379
(mumbling)

812
00:53:37.582 --> 00:53:38.916
You guys all right?

813
00:53:42.387 --> 00:53:43.220
Any bites?

814
00:53:45.323 --> 00:53:46.156
You thirsty?

815
00:53:58.369 --> 00:54:03.274
- Hey. your brother.
super resourceful.

816
00:54:04.909 --> 00:54:05.910
- Yes he is.

817
00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.913
- He'll figure out a
way to return to you.

818
00:54:10.881 --> 00:54:13.451
He's not gonna
leave you I promise.

819
00:54:13.451 --> 00:54:15.152
- I'm scared.

820
00:54:17.655 --> 00:54:19.857
- You know what. me too.

821
00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:29.500
- They're warm. I've
been rationing gas

822
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.537
for the generator.
but it's still tasty.

823
00:54:34.038 --> 00:54:34.872
- Thank you.

824
00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:37.375
Thank you.

825
00:54:38.409 --> 00:54:40.077
- Ben. Ben Clayton.

826
00:54:41.278 --> 00:54:42.112
- I'm Jesse.

827
00:54:43.514 --> 00:54:45.416
And you may know who this is.

828
00:54:47.084 --> 00:54:49.454
Grace. Mark is
her older brother.

829
00:54:49.454 --> 00:54:51.789
- Of course yeah.

830
00:54:53.858 --> 00:54:54.759
- It's your uncle.

831
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.594
Uncle Ben.

832
00:55:02.199 --> 00:55:05.135
I think you need
to get some sleep.

833
00:55:08.706 --> 00:55:10.140
May I?

834
00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.175
- Of course.

835
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:13.611
- Mi cassa. es.... your cassa.

836
00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:20.918
I got some canned tuna in
the kitchen if you're hungry.

837
00:55:21.886 --> 00:55:23.754
Peanut butter too.

838
00:55:23.754 --> 00:55:25.289
- Canned tuna and peanut butter.

839
00:55:25.289 --> 00:55:27.458
Well beggars can't be choosers.

840
00:55:43.641 --> 00:55:44.942
So you live here alone?

841
00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:48.713
(chuckling)

842
00:55:48.713 --> 00:55:49.614
Until now.

843
00:55:51.749 --> 00:55:52.917
I lost all of them.

844
00:55:55.386 --> 00:55:57.988
We can hide at my house.

845
00:55:57.988 --> 00:56:00.491
I got food and water for weeks.

846
00:56:01.892 --> 00:56:06.130
But you're welcome to stay.
both of you as long as you want.

847
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:13.671
(spooky music)

848
00:56:27.552 --> 00:56:30.788
- Pa. someone's at
that truck again.

849
00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:39.997
(growling)

850
00:56:39.997 --> 00:56:41.365
- No. oh my God.

851
00:56:43.801 --> 00:56:46.403
No. come on. start start start!

852
00:56:47.772 --> 00:56:52.777
(growling)
(car engine roaring)

853
00:56:57.582 --> 00:56:59.550
- Mark and Grace plan to stay.

854
00:57:01.452 --> 00:57:02.853
- Of course.

855
00:57:02.853 --> 00:57:03.854
Family's family.

856
00:57:04.955 --> 00:57:06.390
- Thank you for taking us in.

857
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:14.364
Mark says you're a prepper.

858
00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:15.566
- Does he now?

859
00:57:17.502 --> 00:57:18.703
Well I admit it.

860
00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:22.072
I secretly hope to see it.

861
00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:26.043
- You were hoping for this?

862
00:57:26.043 --> 00:57:28.212
You wanted it.

863
00:57:28.212 --> 00:57:29.346
- We had it coming.

864
00:57:30.848 --> 00:57:35.486
The baby killers.
trans-whatchamacallits.
everything.

865
00:57:35.486 --> 00:57:36.987
Couldn't have dreamed
this up exactly.

866
00:57:36.987 --> 00:57:41.959
but the Lord does work
in mysterious ways.

867
00:57:41.959 --> 00:57:46.396
- Well. I could use a little
less mystery in my life.

868
00:57:49.834 --> 00:57:51.502
- They'll keep
coming and coming.

869
00:57:53.037 --> 00:57:54.772
More and more of them every day.

870
00:57:56.406 --> 00:57:57.775
It's only a matter of time.

871
00:57:59.076 --> 00:58:04.014
(car engine roaring)
(growling)

872
00:58:11.455 --> 00:58:12.957
- She's worried about
her brother. that's all.

873
00:58:14.559 --> 00:58:17.127
- These are hard times
for little things.

874
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:22.600
Jesse. the world's been
falling apart around us.

875
00:58:23.768 --> 00:58:25.970
We knew too much
for our own good.

876
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:29.807
Here we are paying
the consequences.

877
00:58:29.807 --> 00:58:32.577
(suspense music)

878
00:59:21.726 --> 00:59:22.627
Are you ready?

879
00:59:23.961 --> 00:59:24.795
- For what?

880
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:27.965
- The blessing?

881
00:59:27.965 --> 00:59:29.299
(banging)

882
00:59:29.299 --> 00:59:34.304
(car engine roaring)
(growling)

883
00:59:45.783 --> 00:59:48.619
(dramatic music)

884
00:59:48.619 --> 00:59:50.621
- Get on him boy. where
is your kill shot.

885
00:59:50.621 --> 00:59:52.790
(gunshot)

886
00:59:57.828 --> 00:59:59.897
You're a lousy goddamn shot.

887
00:59:59.897 --> 01:00:01.198
Give the gun to your sister.

888
01:00:01.198 --> 01:00:03.433
(gunshots)

889
01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:05.803
(screaming)

890
01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:07.537
Come on we gotta get
that truck. let's go.

891
01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:10.274
(suspense music)

892
01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:19.717
(gun corking)
You don't want to do that

893
01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:22.286
(spooky music)

894
01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:35.265
- Actually. would
you hold these?

895
01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:36.500
Hand them me to
me one at a time.

896
01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:40.504
(gun corking)

897
01:00:40.504 --> 01:00:43.073
(spooky music)

898
01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:01.792
This goes right about there.

899
01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:07.397
(spooky music)

900
01:01:13.537 --> 01:01:14.638
Ben was my friend.

901
01:01:17.975 --> 01:01:20.677
He let me stay in the
camper outside the barn.

902
01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:26.917
I helped him with
most of his projects.

903
01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:35.760
And then those demons
out there bit him.

904
01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:46.904
Pick it up. pick it up.

905
01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:04.088
I had to put Ben down.

906
01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:13.563
Actually I don't think he
minds I took his place.

907
01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:24.108
And you know. it is so nice
having somebody around again.

908
01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:35.552
Jesse. you arrived just in time.

909
01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:40.891
To see Ben's vision through

910
01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:43.160
(bursting)

911
01:02:45.162 --> 01:02:50.167
Took Ben and I years to
prepare. heck no. decades.

912
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.404
Listen

913
01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:56.640
(bursting)

914
01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.278
- Hurry. Grace.

915
01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:03.313
Hey you're going to
miss the best part!

916
01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:10.454
(car engine roaring)

917
01:03:14.892 --> 01:03:17.061
That crazy bastard's
not your uncle.

918
01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:21.165
(car engine roaring)

919
01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:23.433
(growling)

920
01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:31.108
(somber music) bit

921
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:36.914
- No. just a shot.

922
01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:43.087
You promise to look after Grace?

923
01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:47.624
- Mark?

924
01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:53.063
- I know it's difficult
under the circumstances.

925
01:03:53.063 --> 01:03:57.367
but try make try to
make the world a better
place for her. please.

926
01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.572
- that's tall order.

927
01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.541
I know you can do it.

928
01:04:04.541 --> 01:04:05.976
You're..resourceful

929
01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:06.810
- Mark!

930
01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:10.447
- I love you.

931
01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:11.581
- Love you too.

932
01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.417
Please don't leave me.

933
01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:15.685
(somber music)

934
01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.321
Mark no!

935
01:04:17.321 --> 01:04:18.222
Mark. Mark!

936
01:04:21.825 --> 01:04:24.394
(somber music)

937
01:04:39.944 --> 01:04:40.777
I'm thirsty.

938
01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:43.780
I'll find us some water.

939
01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:47.784
- Do people get
thirsty in heaven?

940
01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:50.220
- No.

941
01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:53.457
- Is there a soda pop in heaven?

942
01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.762
- All that you want.
no belly aches.

943
01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:04.001
- Will Mark go to heaven?

944
01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:08.438
- I believe so.

945
01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:13.477
- Will the monsters
be in heaven?

946
01:05:15.012 --> 01:05:18.315
- No. only good
people like Mark.

947
01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:20.384
- Jesse?

948
01:05:20.384 --> 01:05:21.618
- Jesus will you shut up?

949
01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:23.520
I don't know. okay.

950
01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.721
I don't know everything.

951
01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.535
- Those monsters are in there.

952
01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:39.669
- Get behind me. go!

953
01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:45.642
(growling)
(gunshots)

954
01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:48.778
Grace. get down!

955
01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:05.462
- No no no no!

956
01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:07.697
(gunshots)

957
01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:19.643
- There's more of them.

958
01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:21.911
(gunshots)

959
01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:24.848
That looks like
one of our trolls.

960
01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:27.117
(gunshots)

961
01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:31.855
Hope none of those people
are our subscribers.

962
01:06:41.398 --> 01:06:44.434
What are you young ladies
doing way out here?

963
01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:48.338
We made a mess there.
but they'll make a
nice yard ornaments.

964
01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:50.440
My name Hickok45.

965
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.109
- I'm Jesse. this is Grace.

966
01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:53.577
- Hi.

967
01:06:53.577 --> 01:06:55.112
- That's kind of strange. huh?

968
01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:57.414
- It's about YouTube Name.
you see my videos. right?

969
01:06:58.382 --> 01:06:59.349
- No.
- No.

970
01:07:00.284 --> 01:07:01.185
- Didn't think so.

971
01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:02.152
Didn't think so.

972
01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:03.387
(laughing)

973
01:07:03.387 --> 01:07:05.722
Well that was another
world. another time.

974
01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:07.457
Why don't you all follow me?

975
01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:23.640
End of the world. when it
comes right down to it.

976
01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:28.011
All a man needs a good cigar.
a cup of coffee and an arsenal.

977
01:07:28.011 --> 01:07:29.513
An arsenal of weapons is good.

978
01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:32.149
- How many you got?

979
01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:34.751
(growling)

980
01:07:34.751 --> 01:07:36.386
- Jesse. I think you'll
really like this 1911.

981
01:07:36.386 --> 01:07:38.588
has a sweet. sweet trigger.

982
01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:39.823
You wanna try that one?

983
01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:41.925
Find one of your
targets out there.

984
01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:44.194
(growling)

985
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:47.931
(gunshots)

986
01:07:47.931 --> 01:07:49.133
Okay. not bad.

987
01:07:49.133 --> 01:07:50.467
I think it'll help
you if you get

988
01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:51.768
this left hand up on there.

989
01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:52.969
kind of a more comfortable grip

990
01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:54.304
instead of on the bottom of it.

991
01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:55.572
- Okay.
- Just bring it up.

992
01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:57.774
Yeah. I like that. a
little more support.

993
01:07:57.774 --> 01:07:58.708
Okay. try it.

994
01:07:58.708 --> 01:07:59.609
Take your time.

995
01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:01.278
(growling)

996
01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:03.513
(gunshots)

997
01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:05.615
Good job.

998
01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:06.650
It's a little big. isn't it?

999
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:08.485
But shoots nicely. yeah.

1000
01:08:08.485 --> 01:08:09.419
- It's kinda good.

1001
01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:10.620
- Let me show you this one

1002
01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.222
and I think that you'll
really like the grip

1003
01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:14.191
of a little better
unless I'm mistaken.

1004
01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:15.759
'cause this one. this
will fit your hand

1005
01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:16.693
I think a little bit better.

1006
01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:18.628
Try that. just get a feel of it.

1007
01:08:18.628 --> 01:08:19.563
- It's good.

1008
01:08:19.563 --> 01:08:20.397
- Does that feel good?

1009
01:08:20.397 --> 01:08:21.231
- Yes. good.

1010
01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:22.166
- Yeah. that's not.

1011
01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:23.399
I thought you'd like that.

1012
01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.067
Well. I wanna give
you this. okay?

1013
01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:25.568
Take with you.

1014
01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:29.372
And I've got shots and shells
in this bag and this pistol.

1015
01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:30.639
if you take that.

1016
01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:32.376
and then the shotgun is
fully loaded. all right?

1017
01:08:32.376 --> 01:08:33.910
So hopefully that'll
get you through.

1018
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:35.111
- Thank you so much.

1019
01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.813
(bursting)

1020
01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:37.846
What was that?

1021
01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:39.148
- That would be my nephew.

1022
01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:41.785
What are you two up to?

1023
01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:44.288
- setting booty traps?

1024
01:08:44.288 --> 01:08:45.988
- I think you mean booby traps.

1025
01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:47.791
- That's what I
said. booty traps.

1026
01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:49.292
- Very funny.

1027
01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:50.727
- This is Jessie.

1028
01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:51.995
She's a good egg.

1029
01:08:51.995 --> 01:08:52.961
She'd been looking
after a little one

1030
01:08:52.961 --> 01:08:54.664
since Middle Creek city.

1031
01:08:54.664 --> 01:08:55.631
- Boy or girl?

1032
01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.466
- Girl.

1033
01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:57.300
Her name's Grace.

1034
01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:58.535
- Where's she at?

1035
01:08:58.535 --> 01:09:00.670
- She's catching some
Z's up on the porch.

1036
01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.038
They need some wheels.

1037
01:09:02.038 --> 01:09:04.040
You don't have any
extra wheels. do you?

1038
01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:09.679
- It's a bit much of a truck
for her don't you think?

1039
01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:12.081
- She's made it this
far. she can handle this.

1040
01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.317
You'll be fine.

1041
01:09:13.317 --> 01:09:14.050
It'll get you from
point A to point B.

1042
01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:16.719
- I should go and grab Grace.

1043
01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:22.859
Grace?

1044
01:09:29.032 --> 01:09:30.500
- She's got it.

1045
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.335
- What. no.

1046
01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:35.939
She didn't get bit.

1047
01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:37.841
I don't understand.

1048
01:09:41.745 --> 01:09:42.946
- She's tiny.

1049
01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:43.813
Now that it's taken
hold. it won't take long

1050
01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:44.814
for it to take her.

1051
01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:46.383
You gotta-

1052
01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:47.217
- No. no.

1053
01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:51.621
- There's no choice.

1054
01:09:51.621 --> 01:09:53.189
You want her turn to
one of those things?

1055
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.990
- I'll do it.

1056
01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:57.327
Just get to where you're going.

1057
01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:00.996
- She's my responsibility.

1058
01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:04.568
I promised her brother
I'll look after her.

1059
01:10:04.568 --> 01:10:07.336
(dramatic music)

1060
01:10:10.374 --> 01:10:12.609
(growling)

1061
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:16.380
(gunshots)

1062
01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:44.773
(car engine roaring)

1063
01:10:48.878 --> 01:10:52.048
(lively guitar music)

1064
01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:52.881
- Think she'll live?

1065
01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:53.717
Who lives

1066
01:10:57.421 --> 01:10:58.822
What are we gonna do now?

1067
01:10:58.822 --> 01:11:01.224
- Should stuff. blows stuff up.

1068
01:11:01.224 --> 01:11:02.225
- Shoot some guns.

1069
01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:05.328
- How many do you think we got?

1070
01:11:05.328 --> 01:11:06.830
- Probably like 30. 35.

1071
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.164
- How many you think you'll get?

1072
01:11:08.164 --> 01:11:09.433
- 30. 35.

1073
01:11:11.234 --> 01:11:12.167
- I don't have a shot gun.

1074
01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.068
- Oh. we're doing pistols huh?

1075
01:11:13.068 --> 01:11:14.304
- Yes.
- All right.

1076
01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:16.172
Bring it

1077
01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:17.005
Okay.

1078
01:11:17.005 --> 01:11:18.006
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1079
01:11:18.006 --> 01:11:19.776
- Standby. go!

1080
01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:22.045
(gunshots)

1081
01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:02.818
You Freaking suck

1082
01:12:07.791 --> 01:12:08.692
- That was awful.

1083
01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:12.829
(dramatic music)

1084
01:12:22.939 --> 01:12:25.509
(car tires screeching)

1085
01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:28.111
(spooky music)

1086
01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:40.156
- God!

1087
01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:43.192
(growling)

1088
01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:45.361
(gunshot)

1089
01:12:47.797 --> 01:12:49.132
Grace!

1090
01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:52.368
(spooky music)

1091
01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:54.538
(crying)

1092
01:12:54.538 --> 01:12:57.106
(somber music)

1093
01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.330
No!

1094
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.433
(crying)

1095
01:13:38.815 --> 01:13:41.918
(car engine roaring)

1096
01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:48.224
(somber music)

1097
01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:11.214
(car engine roaring)

1098
01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:32.401
(gun corking)

1099
01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:51.855
(growling)

1100
01:14:51.855 --> 01:14:53.121
(dramatic music)

1101
01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:56.359
(car tires screeching)

1102
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:06.936
(growling)

1103
01:15:06.936 --> 01:15:09.205
(gunshots)

1104
01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.342
(dramatic music)

1105
01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.177
- Shit!

1106
01:15:16.713 --> 01:15:18.682
(dramatic music)

1107
01:15:18.682 --> 01:15:20.116
(gunshots)

1108
01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:22.886
(dramatic music)

1109
01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:32.028
(growling)

1110
01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:38.067
(gunshots)

1111
01:15:57.186 --> 01:16:00.089
Don't shoot it. who
the hell are you?

1112
01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:01.758
Why are you here?

1113
01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:03.960
- I'm looking for Dr. Campbell.

1114
01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.428
Dr. Judith Campbell.

1115
01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:08.764
Wait a minute. I recognize you.

1116
01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:10.700
(dramatic music)

1117
01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:11.534
- Jesse.

1118
01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:14.771
If you are watching
this you already know

1119
01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:16.105
how bad things have become.

1120
01:16:18.474 --> 01:16:23.478
Everyone here has either
run away or been infected.

1121
01:16:24.648 --> 01:16:26.282
except myself and
the security guard.

1122
01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:31.755
But sweetheart. I'm
not feeling very well.

1123
01:16:31.755 --> 01:16:34.257
(spooky music)

1124
01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:35.491
(laughing)

1125
01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:37.493
I've never been
as strong as you.

1126
01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:42.932
You have never been sick

1127
01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:46.035
a day in your life
despite being exposed

1128
01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.904
to many different viruses.

1129
01:16:50.073 --> 01:16:52.175
It is for that
reason that I believe

1130
01:16:52.175 --> 01:16:54.710
that you have made it and
you're watching this now.

1131
01:16:58.915 --> 01:17:00.850
All I have is the
hope that you're safe.

1132
01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:06.222
(dramatic music)

1133
01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:07.523
It was all my fault.

1134
01:17:09.993 --> 01:17:11.460
We thought it would work.

1135
01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:15.364
We had no idea the virus
would spiral out of control

1136
01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:16.933
and mutate. evolve.

1137
01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:28.244
I have destroyed all the
rest of the vaccines.

1138
01:17:29.813 --> 01:17:32.380
And I have given a
box that contains

1139
01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:34.984
the original virus to Tori.

1140
01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:39.989
The security guard. she
knows where to take it

1141
01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.893
With your antibodies
and the virus.

1142
01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:48.064
They will know how
to make this stop.

1143
01:17:51.034 --> 01:17:52.736
(somber music)

1144
01:17:52.736 --> 01:17:54.403
You've always been so strong.

1145
01:17:57.473 --> 01:18:02.411
If there is hope. you're it.

1146
01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:12.188
- People need to
know about this.

1147
01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:14.958
- There's another
lab in Washington DC.

1148
01:18:14.958 --> 01:18:16.459
- My truck's done for.

1149
01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:18.928
I don't suppose you have armored
tank around here . do you?

1150
01:18:18.928 --> 01:18:20.063
- Got something better.

1151
01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:24.532
(growling)

1152
01:18:24.532 --> 01:18:26.770
(gunshots)

1153
01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:30.539
They annoy the fuck out of me.

1154
01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.608
(growling)

1155
01:18:32.608 --> 01:18:34.878
(gunshots)

1156
01:18:49.993 --> 01:18:52.228
(growling)

1157
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:09.813
(motorbike engine roaring)

1158
01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:14.317
(gunshots)
(growling)

1159
01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:21.490
- [Woman] Finally in July. 2021.

1160
01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:25.561
doctors discovered Jesse's
blood produced a rare antibody.

1161
01:19:26.629 --> 01:19:31.134
Which scientists
inserted into the CO321.

1162
01:19:31.134 --> 01:19:32.635
a secret government weapon

1163
01:19:32.635 --> 01:19:35.771
initially used to manipulate
enemy weather patterns.

1164
01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:41.377
What was developed as
a destructive agent.

1165
01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:43.179
turned out to be
the perfect method

1166
01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:44.746
to distribute the
vaccine world wide .

1167
01:19:46.883 --> 01:19:48.217
Never lose hope.

1168
01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:52.521
(dramatic music)

1169
01:21:12.601 --> 01:21:17.606
* Its only the demon
that you have chosen *

1170
01:21:19.242 --> 01:21:22.545
* They keep you safe

1171
01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:27.550
* Locked away in
a secret place *

1172
01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:33.089
* At the back of
your twisted mind *

1173
01:21:34.958 --> 01:21:39.963
* And I can't hide
from this monsters *

1174
01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:47.570
* Are living inside me

1175
01:21:49.305 --> 01:21:54.277
* And I could never deny

1176
01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:59.482
* These creatures
they always find me *

1177
01:22:02.285 --> 01:22:07.290
* Scratching their
way to the surface *

1178
01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:12.861
* There's no use fighting.
it's not just worth it *

1179
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:16.799
* 'Cause I have seen

1180
01:22:16.799 --> 01:22:21.804
* This nightmare is pulling
me apart at the seams *

1181
01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:27.143
* This madness
haunts my dreams *

1182
01:22:27.143 --> 01:22:32.148
* And I can't hide
from this monsters *

1183
01:22:36.852 --> 01:22:39.922
* Are living inside me

1184
01:22:39.922 --> 01:22:44.927
* And I could never deny all

1185
01:22:48.831 --> 01:22:53.835
* These creatures
they always find me *

1186
01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:02.245

* It's only in your mind

1190
01:23:23.699 --> 01:23:28.704

* These creatures
they always find me *

1195

* Always find me
