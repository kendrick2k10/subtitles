3
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.838
Where those flags
are on the horizon...

4
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:59.363
that's Barretos.
that's the rodeo grounds.

5
00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:00.582
It's like a mirage!

6
00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:03.019
I can't believe we're here!

7
00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.501
A-ha!

8
00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:10.026
Oh. thank you!

9
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.680
Ah!

10
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:17.512
Oh. man...

11
00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:19.731
I can't believe we made it!

12
00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:27.565
Oh. thank you.

13
00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:29.741
Thank you. thank you.

14
00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:32.048
Thank you.

15
00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:39.055
There is a common phrase
in our world that goes.

16
00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.710
"The dog may be man's best friend.

17
00:01:41.753 --> 00:01:45.105
"but the horse
helped write history."

18
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:52.982
Everything we have today
and we enjoy in modern society

19
00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.072
was built on the back of a horse.

20
00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.205
They were the first animals
brought to the New World

21
00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:00.642
to plough our fields. to go to war for us.

22
00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.386
to carry us to the West
and find new fertile lands.

23
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.389
And according to both fossil
records and oral traditions.

24
00:02:08.432 --> 00:02:11.435
horses were also an active part
of Indigenous culture

25
00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:16.484
across the Americas
even before settlers arrived.

26
00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:20.792
I've lived so intensely
beside these majestic animals.

27
00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:23.752
Travelling. eating with them.
sleeping next to them.

28
00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:26.407
living great adventures
next to them.

29
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.324
And the horse
has been in my life...

30
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:32.239
since I was born.

31
00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.419
My name is Filipe because
it means "a friend of horses."

32
00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:42.292
and I was on top of a horse
before I could walk.

33
00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:46.427
My earliest memory of a horse
is a near tragedy.

34
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.779
I'm seven years old.
I'm on a big. grey mare;

35
00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:53.129
My dad had put me
in an equestrian program

36
00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.523
to learn how to jump.

37
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.961
The coach had taken us out
on a field to gallop the horses.

38
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:02.182
and I lost the grey mare.

39
00:03:02.225 --> 00:03:04.314
And she was just galloping.

40
00:03:04.358 --> 00:03:08.884
galloping. galloping.

41
00:03:08.971 --> 00:03:10.799
I remember at that moment.

42
00:03:10.842 --> 00:03:13.976
being on that runaway horse.
I was so scared.

43
00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.022
but at the same time.
the adrenaline I felt.

44
00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:20.635
I kinda wished that mare
would just keep running forever.

45
00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.651
I was born in a small town

46
00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:41.830
called Espírito Santo do Pinhal
in Saão Paulo. Brazil.

47
00:03:41.873 --> 00:03:45.007
I grew up on a small farm.

48
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.879
My first horse was called Marto Lipe.

49
00:03:47.923 --> 00:03:50.708
We couldn't ride the thing
because it was a wild horse;

50
00:03:50.752 --> 00:03:52.275
It was absolutely crazy.

51
00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:54.712
but I remember that just
to look at it and be around it.

52
00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:59.848
you know. it just made me so happy.

53
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:01.502
When I was nine years old.

54
00:04:01.545 --> 00:04:03.765
my life changed dramatically.

55
00:04:03.852 --> 00:04:05.680
My parents moved to Canada.

56
00:04:05.723 --> 00:04:08.378
I remember when my dad told me
"So. we're moving to Canada!"

57
00:04:08.422 --> 00:04:10.250
I was like...

58
00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:12.730
I didn't even know what Canada was!

59
00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.213
I look back
at that moment of my life

60
00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:21.261
where at nine
I moved countries...

61
00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:26.701
It was the first moment that
I had to face real adversity.

62
00:04:26.744 --> 00:04:29.225
The horse
completely left my life

63
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.532
for the first few years
that we were here.

64
00:04:31.575 --> 00:04:35.405
We just didn't have the means.

65
00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.582
When I was a little kid.
I was the most scared child

66
00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:39.931
on the face of the earth.

67
00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:42.369
and when my dad turned
the lights off in my room.

68
00:04:42.412 --> 00:04:44.545
I would cry.

69
00:04:44.588 --> 00:04:45.894
I was afraid of the dark.

70
00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:48.418
I thought the boogeyman
was under my bed.

71
00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:50.377
My dad would come into my room;

72
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.294
He would tell me
the story of Aimé Tschiffely.

73
00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:57.471
a Swiss school teacher
who in 1925

74
00:04:57.558 --> 00:05:00.822
rode horseback from
Buenos Aires. Argentina.

75
00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.433
all the way to the United States.

76
00:05:03.477 --> 00:05:04.956
He would use that story to show me

77
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.916
that Tschiffely wasn't afraid.

78
00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:12.094
Tschiffely crossed the Americas
with his horses Mancha and Gato.

79
00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:14.009
He climbed the highest mountains.

80
00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:16.620
swam rivers full of crocodiles.

81
00:05:16.664 --> 00:05:19.580
And I remember just imagining
what it would be like to cross

82
00:05:19.623 --> 00:05:21.930
all these countries on horseback.

83
00:05:21.973 --> 00:05:26.630
and it just became my life's dream.

84
00:05:26.674 --> 00:05:31.287
There's this innate want
and desire in me to wander.

85
00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.423
Ultimately. every cell in my body

86
00:05:36.466 --> 00:05:40.470
was telling me to get on
that horse and ride home.

87
00:05:40.514 --> 00:05:45.780
It just got stronger
and stronger the older I got.

88
00:05:45.823 --> 00:05:49.392
A long rider
is an individual that rides

89
00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.136
a thousand miles or more in a journey.

90
00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:56.356
Oscar Wilde is a long rider.

91
00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.141
Marco Polo.
Charles Darwin.

92
00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:01.665
And there's an international
organization called

93
00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:03.145
The Long Riders Guild

94
00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:05.452
that shares all these stories
of people who have

95
00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:06.975
jumped into the saddle

96
00:06:07.018 --> 00:06:09.325
and ridden off into the unknown.

97
00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.156
The Long Riders
Guild was the world's first

98
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.725
international association
of equestrian explorers.

99
00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:20.554
It has members in 48 countries.

100
00:06:20.641 --> 00:06:23.383
More than 100 of the
long riders are fellows

101
00:06:23.426 --> 00:06:25.515
of the World Geographical Society

102
00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:29.998
because of the extraordinary
journeys that they made.

103
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:33.088
I've answered emails for more
than 20 years from people

104
00:06:33.175 --> 00:06:37.005
in every country from Albania to Yemen.

105
00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:40.487
What's important to note is that
when people are confronted

106
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.576
with the reality.

107
00:06:42.663 --> 00:06:46.057
not the romance. of equestrian travel.

108
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:48.669
then they're forced to see

109
00:06:48.712 --> 00:06:53.587
how difficult and potentially
dangerous and hard it is.

110
00:06:53.674 --> 00:06:55.589
That's why 95 percent of the people

111
00:06:55.676 --> 00:07:00.202
who have ever written me
never set off.

112
00:07:00.245 --> 00:07:01.682
To prepare for this journey.

113
00:07:01.725 --> 00:07:06.034
I spent two years in a war room.

114
00:07:06.077 --> 00:07:09.559
I had to lose weight;
I had to build my core.

115
00:07:09.603 --> 00:07:11.866
Make contacts. draw the route.

116
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.216
reading as much literature
as I could.

117
00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.610
Just convincing that
a 20-something-year-old kid

118
00:07:16.697 --> 00:07:18.916
who had no previous experience long riding

119
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.266
could pull off one of the longest

120
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.445
and most arduous rides
of the 21st century.

121
00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.477
To be honest with you.
when Filipe came to me

122
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.436
and told me he was gonna
do Canada to Brazil.

123
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.742
I didn't believe.

124
00:08:01.785 --> 00:08:03.831
I said. "Wow. he's gonna say that.

125
00:08:03.918 --> 00:08:06.573
"but after one month or two.

126
00:08:06.616 --> 00:08:08.792
"trying to get everything together.

127
00:08:08.836 --> 00:08:11.316
"he's gonna just
forget about it."

128
00:08:18.976 --> 00:08:21.849
Like. what are you
leaving in Calgary?

129
00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:23.981
I'm not leaving
anything in Calgary.

130
00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:25.592
You're not?

131
00:08:25.635 --> 00:08:27.550
No.
Everything I'm taking now.

132
00:08:27.637 --> 00:08:29.683
I'm gonna take with me on the trip.

133
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.774
Emma and I. we met in university.

134
00:08:33.817 --> 00:08:36.124
She always encouraged me to take risks.

135
00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:37.865
even though it meant that. you know.

136
00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:43.131
I wasn't going to see her while
I was training for my ride.

137
00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:45.481
My plan is to ride from Calgary. Canada.

138
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:46.787
to my family's home

139
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.965
in Espírito Santo do Pinhal.
Brazil.

140
00:08:51.008 --> 00:08:52.532
Right now the weather is warm.

141
00:08:52.575 --> 00:08:56.144
but winter is going to
creep up on us very quickly.

142
00:08:56.187 --> 00:08:58.363
and I have got to make it
to Mexico by then.

143
00:08:58.407 --> 00:09:00.191
or the whole journey is screwed.

144
00:09:00.235 --> 00:09:03.151
My dad is thinking about
riding with me through Mexico.

145
00:09:03.194 --> 00:09:06.371
and my mom may come out
at some point in Latin America.

146
00:09:06.415 --> 00:09:09.200
But for the most part.
I'll be going alone.

147
00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:12.377
Crossing the Panama Canal
will be a major issue.

148
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:14.989
but I know that by the time we
get there. we'll figure it out.

149
00:09:15.032 --> 00:09:17.818
Then I ride through Colombia.
and make it to Brazil.

150
00:09:17.861 --> 00:09:19.341
At our pace.

151
00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:22.562
I think it's gonna take
about two years to get home.

152
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.265
We're at the Greyhound
bus station in Toronto.

153
00:09:30.352 --> 00:09:34.530
I should be getting on the bus
at 12:15 and going to Saskatoon.

154
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:38.534
I get to Saskatoon for 5 o'clock
in the morning tomorrow.

155
00:09:48.239 --> 00:09:52.548
Filipe was
facing two major obstacles.

156
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.898
tactical and political.

157
00:09:54.942 --> 00:09:57.901
Even though Filipe had
an intense equestrian background

158
00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:00.034
and was a skilled rider.

159
00:10:00.077 --> 00:10:02.906
he did not know anything
about horseback packing.

160
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.387
pack horses. or pack saddles.

161
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.217
So I contacted Canadian
long rider Stan Walchuk.

162
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.394
who is the expert in that topic.

163
00:10:12.437 --> 00:10:15.615
and Stan not only
offered to mentor Filipe.

164
00:10:15.658 --> 00:10:17.878
he invited him
to come to British Colombia.

165
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:19.793
where he took him
under his wing and taught him

166
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.578
everything about horse packing.

167
00:10:34.808 --> 00:10:37.288
My background is different
from a lot of horse people

168
00:10:37.332 --> 00:10:38.725
in that I've been able to learn

169
00:10:38.768 --> 00:10:40.770
from lots of different people
over the years.

170
00:10:40.814 --> 00:10:43.164
And I've taken ideas and been
with many different people

171
00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:44.731
and tried to collect them all.

172
00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:48.430
and look at what works
and doesn't work.

173
00:10:48.473 --> 00:10:51.172
Take these.
walk up to the horse...

174
00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:52.739
Just kinda clip on.

175
00:10:52.782 --> 00:10:54.697
clip it on there.

176
00:10:54.784 --> 00:10:56.307
Walk it around.

177
00:10:56.351 --> 00:11:00.529
Pull really hard on the front corner.

178
00:11:00.616 --> 00:11:02.923
What will happen is that the
horse will maybe struggle a bit.

179
00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:04.794
It will just stand there
because it knows

180
00:11:04.838 --> 00:11:07.492
that rope is the absolute boss.

181
00:11:16.153 --> 00:11:18.939
Then I started making
lists. everything I needed.

182
00:11:18.982 --> 00:11:20.723
from the horses. paperwork.

183
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.464
saddle. pack saddle.

184
00:11:22.507 --> 00:11:24.292
horseshoes. equipment.

185
00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:27.382
tent. a one-burner oven...

186
00:11:27.469 --> 00:11:30.951
Everything.
The planning was tremendous.

187
00:11:52.015 --> 00:11:54.409
I didn't have the budget
to undertake this journey.

188
00:11:54.496 --> 00:11:57.891
so during the planning stage.
I sent out hundreds of emails.

189
00:11:57.978 --> 00:12:00.502
I sent letters.
called different ranchers.

190
00:12:00.545 --> 00:12:03.810
until finally two ranchers
in Montana

191
00:12:03.853 --> 00:12:07.378
agreed to give me Frenchie
and Bruiser for the journey.

192
00:12:11.165 --> 00:12:12.993
This is my man
Frenchie over here.

193
00:12:13.036 --> 00:12:16.692
and Bruiser on the other side.

194
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.346
Now. Frenchie's been okay.

195
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:19.913
He's been pretty good. but he's
really nervous about everything.

196
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.568
so we're trying to take things
really slowly with him.

197
00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:30.706
I started working on the horses

198
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.882
with putting the
pack saddle on Frenchie

199
00:12:32.926 --> 00:12:35.711
and putting some weight on it
and getting him used to it.

200
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.887
At one point he completely
freaked out. started bucking.

201
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:39.802
and I lost a hold of the rope.

202
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:42.065
and then he scared Bruiser.

203
00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:44.415
and Bruiser started bucking
and threw me off.

204
00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:47.592
I got a huge slit in my pants.
I think my finger's broken.

205
00:12:47.636 --> 00:12:49.377
rope burn...

206
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.206
So I'm a little freaked out.
I don't have that much time.

207
00:13:01.432 --> 00:13:04.261
Leaving from Calgary
put me on top of Montana.

208
00:13:04.305 --> 00:13:07.656
Wyoming. Colorado. horse country.

209
00:13:07.743 --> 00:13:09.440
A lot less people in population.

210
00:13:09.484 --> 00:13:13.227
which makes the ride a lot easier.

211
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.099
The Calgary Stampede
is Canada's largest rodeo.

212
00:13:16.143 --> 00:13:20.756
and it's internationally
renowned in Western culture.

213
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.237
I was lucky they agreed
to give me a send-off

214
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.501
to begin my journey south.

215
00:13:26.588 --> 00:13:29.504
It is 10:40 right now.

216
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:32.768
and we leave in 20 minutes.

217
00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.509
So it's crunch time.

218
00:13:34.596 --> 00:13:38.469
Crunch. crunch.

219
00:13:38.513 --> 00:13:40.994
I've been training for this
moment since I was a little kid.

220
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:43.648
since the first time I heard
the story of Aimé Tschiffely.

221
00:13:43.692 --> 00:13:45.781
riding from Buenos Aires
to New York.

222
00:13:45.825 --> 00:13:49.306
It's been. you know.
a crazy year.

223
00:13:56.444 --> 00:13:59.447
Just getting people to
believe that this could happen.

224
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.841
just to be here for me
is already a huge win.

225
00:14:01.884 --> 00:14:04.800
To be with these beautiful horses

226
00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:06.802
and living my dream.

227
00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.892
You know. I think more people
need to not be scared to

228
00:14:09.979 --> 00:14:11.851
do what they love
and follow their dreams.

229
00:14:11.894 --> 00:14:15.506
'cause we're in a society today
where everyone's so scared

230
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:17.944
to do things. to think outside
the box. and it's really sad.

231
00:14:17.987 --> 00:14:19.815
You gotta go for what you believe.

232
00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:21.469
because when you do.
it's like...

233
00:14:21.512 --> 00:14:22.818
what I'm feeling right now.

234
00:14:22.862 --> 00:14:25.995
there's no other feeling
like this. you know?

235
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.174
And my mom is
very worried. obviously.

236
00:14:31.218 --> 00:14:32.523
She's a mother. so...

237
00:14:32.567 --> 00:14:34.525
she said she's gonna
have to take some sedatives

238
00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:37.354
for the next two years
to try to sleep at night.

239
00:14:37.398 --> 00:14:39.922
But it just feels right.
you know?

240
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:44.492
We're a family that we move
on instinct. we move on feeling.

241
00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:48.539
and if it felt wrong. I wouldn't do it.

242
00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:02.945
I'm gonna go soon. alright?

243
00:15:03.032 --> 00:15:04.555
I'm gonna be worried about you.

244
00:15:04.599 --> 00:15:06.340
I'm okay.
I'm gonna be fine.

245
00:15:06.383 --> 00:15:08.995
We're gonna talk. okay?
I'm gonna be fine.

246
00:15:09.038 --> 00:15:11.171
Don't be worried about me.

247
00:15:11.214 --> 00:15:13.695
You know I'm gonna figure it out. right?

248
00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:21.877
Although she knew
that this was gonna

249
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.010
drive me away from her.
it was gonna drive us apart.

250
00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:26.577
she never told me not to do it.

251
00:15:26.621 --> 00:15:30.364
which now. looking back.
how selfless is that?

252
00:15:30.407 --> 00:15:32.192
I love you.

253
00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:34.455
I'll see you soon. okay?
Don't be sad.

254
00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:36.109
I felt like I had a bowling ball

255
00:15:36.196 --> 00:15:37.414
lodged in my throat.

256
00:15:37.458 --> 00:15:40.243
I was just swallowing...
swallowing the fear back.

257
00:15:40.287 --> 00:15:41.549
I was very scared.

258
00:15:41.592 --> 00:15:44.030
Very scared.

259
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.132
Every equestrian
journey is different.

260
00:15:59.219 --> 00:16:02.613
During my solo ride
across Northern Pakistan.

261
00:16:02.657 --> 00:16:06.835
I was kidnapped. tortured.

262
00:16:06.922 --> 00:16:07.967
falsely imprisoned.

263
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.230
and nearly died of hepatitis.

264
00:16:10.273 --> 00:16:12.101
In contrast.

265
00:16:12.145 --> 00:16:15.757
the British explorers who tried
to reach the South Pole in 1911.

266
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.761
their horses were eaten by Orca whales.

267
00:16:19.804 --> 00:16:21.632
Of course. there's always
the traditional challenges

268
00:16:21.676 --> 00:16:24.287
of mountains. jungles. swamps.

269
00:16:24.331 --> 00:16:26.507
disease-carrying insects.

270
00:16:26.594 --> 00:16:28.291
carnivorous beasts.

271
00:16:28.335 --> 00:16:31.294
and very dangerous human beings.

272
00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:40.347
It was a million degrees.

273
00:16:40.434 --> 00:16:41.478
I'm already thinking.

274
00:16:41.522 --> 00:16:44.525
"Why did I decide
to leave in July?"

275
00:16:44.612 --> 00:16:46.831
No shade.
we're next to this road.

276
00:16:46.875 --> 00:16:51.532
and all of a sudden I realized
I forgot to bring water.

277
00:16:51.619 --> 00:16:54.491
Are you kidding me?

278
00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:59.844
Are you the guy
who's riding to South America?

279
00:16:59.888 --> 00:17:01.368
Yeah!

280
00:17:01.455 --> 00:17:04.066
Well. good luck. man!

281
00:17:04.153 --> 00:17:06.460
I travelled
three kilometres an hour.

282
00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:08.027
30 kilometres a day.

283
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.812
You know. that's the max you can
ride a day for these horses.

284
00:17:10.855 --> 00:17:14.207
so you're always in the middle of nowhere.

285
00:17:14.294 --> 00:17:16.992
So usually you just knock
on a door and ask for help.

286
00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:19.995
Like. who does that these days.
you know what I mean?

287
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.736
And I knocked on these people's door.

288
00:17:21.823 --> 00:17:24.130
and they came out and they were like.

289
00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:26.219
"... Yes?" and I have two
horses with me. I'm like.

290
00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:27.568
"Oh. hi. my name is Filipe.

291
00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:30.005
"I'm riding horses from Canada to Brazil.

292
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.094
"and I was wondering if
I could spend the night here?"

293
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:33.139
And they were like...

294
00:17:35.184 --> 00:17:38.535
So I just
set up camp in their field.

295
00:17:54.203 --> 00:17:56.684
I wake up and Bruiser

296
00:17:56.727 --> 00:18:01.689
had bit Frenchie's back
right where the pack sits.

297
00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:04.126
I couldn't put the pack on
because if I put the pack on

298
00:18:04.213 --> 00:18:05.388
it was gonna start rubbing it

299
00:18:05.432 --> 00:18:07.173
and it was gonna create a wound

300
00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:10.524
and it was gonna slowly
become worse and worse.

301
00:18:10.567 --> 00:18:14.571
But I had no choice; I had to pack him.

302
00:18:14.615 --> 00:18:16.878
I could notice the discomfort.

303
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:19.098
I take the pack saddle off
and sure enough.

304
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:23.276
it had rubbed the wound
and now it was inflated.

305
00:18:23.363 --> 00:18:27.193
If I keep going like this.
it's only gonna get worse.

306
00:18:27.236 --> 00:18:28.629
I'm gonna have to stop a car

307
00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:31.719
and see if someone can take
the pack to the next town.

308
00:18:31.762 --> 00:18:34.939
and then I'll just figure it out
when I get there.

309
00:18:37.594 --> 00:18:39.727
I heard about you through my mom

310
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.468
when I was going to the Stampede.

311
00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:44.297
that you were going to Brazil on a horse.

312
00:18:44.384 --> 00:18:46.908
and I'm a horse-lover
myself. so yeah.

313
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:48.910
just this one day you were
passing through the reserve

314
00:18:48.953 --> 00:18:52.479
and I seen you
and I thought I'd help you.

315
00:18:52.566 --> 00:18:54.481
Right now I'm dispatching
for the Blood Tribe police.

316
00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:57.179
I'm actually just
waiting to go to Depot.

317
00:18:57.266 --> 00:19:00.269
and then I'll come back and be
a police officer on the reserve.

318
00:19:00.313 --> 00:19:05.231
you know. where I can help my own people.

319
00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:08.147
I'd like to give you
this for your travels

320
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.584
so you'll always be protected.

321
00:19:10.627 --> 00:19:14.109
Sharlee took me to meet
one of the Blood Tribe's elders.

322
00:19:18.766 --> 00:19:20.507
She gave me some sweet grass

323
00:19:20.594 --> 00:19:23.249
so I could burn and protect me

324
00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:26.600
because I was very nervous
to cross the American border.

325
00:19:26.643 --> 00:19:28.036
She saw that I was nervous.
she's like.

326
00:19:28.123 --> 00:19:29.255
"Alright. you burn it.

327
00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:31.213
"you smother yourself with the smoke.

328
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.693
"and you pray to your God

329
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.651
"and ask for your God
to protect you."

330
00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:39.439
When we first came to Canada.

331
00:19:39.482 --> 00:19:40.962
my dad had a work permit

332
00:19:41.005 --> 00:19:43.791
and he renewed that work
permit for eight years.

333
00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:46.968
On year number eight.
the work permit got denied.

334
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:50.885
and we were asked
to leave Canada in 15 days.

335
00:19:50.972 --> 00:19:53.366
We went to this immigration centre.

336
00:19:53.453 --> 00:19:56.020
we talked to them through
a Plexiglas window.

337
00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:58.153
and just the way this woman.
like. talked to us.

338
00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:01.548
it was like we had...
stolen or killed.

339
00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:03.506
Just treated us like garbage.

340
00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:06.379
And I remember at one point.
like. I was just bawling.

341
00:20:06.466 --> 00:20:08.555
and this woman did not blink an eye.

342
00:20:08.642 --> 00:20:12.036
Like. it was just
almost like that Plexiglas

343
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.647
had her in another world

344
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.477
where hearts and compassion
doesn't exist.

345
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.001
So my dad. in a panic.
hired a lawyer.

346
00:20:20.044 --> 00:20:21.481
got some bad advice.

347
00:20:21.524 --> 00:20:24.266
and the lawyer told him to
apply for humanitarian reasons

348
00:20:24.353 --> 00:20:25.746
so that we could remain here.

349
00:20:25.833 --> 00:20:27.008
That took two years.

350
00:20:27.051 --> 00:20:29.184
in which time I started university.

351
00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:30.881
and after my first year
of university.

352
00:20:30.925 --> 00:20:32.492
we got a letter saying.

353
00:20:32.535 --> 00:20:33.841
"Denied.

354
00:20:33.884 --> 00:20:37.236
"You have 15 days to
leave the country again."

355
00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:39.281
Well. with my immigration history.

356
00:20:39.368 --> 00:20:40.848
and the fact that I'm a Brazilian kid

357
00:20:40.891 --> 00:20:43.024
riding two horses.

358
00:20:43.067 --> 00:20:46.723
I was so nervous
coming up to the US border.

359
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:01.695
It ended up
being the easiest border

360
00:21:01.738 --> 00:21:04.219
of the entire trip.

361
00:21:18.407 --> 00:21:20.453
We've just arrived in the US.

362
00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.238
I'm on my way to bad Montana.

363
00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:25.588
and it's just extremely hot.

364
00:21:25.632 --> 00:21:30.550
It's so hot.

365
00:21:30.593 --> 00:21:34.293
I've been walking
for. like. maybe 10 miles.

366
00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:37.600
to give the horses a break.

367
00:21:37.644 --> 00:21:39.602
Oh. it's the first shade
I've found.

368
00:21:39.646 --> 00:21:41.735
and it feels good to be here.

369
00:21:45.478 --> 00:21:47.262
Once we entered Montana.

370
00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.830
we found ourselves in the worst drought

371
00:21:49.917 --> 00:21:52.833
the US had had in a generation.

372
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:55.401
Come on. buddy. please.

373
00:21:57.141 --> 00:22:00.797
And that made my life
and the horses' life just hell.

374
00:22:00.841 --> 00:22:03.409
So here's a stream behind me
that was once flowing

375
00:22:03.452 --> 00:22:06.020
with water.
and today it's just bone-dry.

376
00:22:06.107 --> 00:22:08.979
You can even walk right in it
and walk right under the bridge.

377
00:22:09.023 --> 00:22:12.592
And this is real sad
because a lot of farmers

378
00:22:12.635 --> 00:22:15.769
depend on these creeks to farm
and to water their crops.

379
00:22:15.812 --> 00:22:17.640
Finding water for these animals

380
00:22:17.684 --> 00:22:22.210
became such a huge problem.

381
00:22:22.297 --> 00:22:24.691
You only eat after
your horses have eaten.

382
00:22:24.778 --> 00:22:27.433
You only drink after they've
had something to drink.

383
00:22:27.476 --> 00:22:31.219
And you only rest when your
horses are resting and happy.

384
00:23:04.383 --> 00:23:06.341
So. we rested for a couple days

385
00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:07.473
at Copper Spring Ranch.

386
00:23:07.516 --> 00:23:09.388
which is Bruiser's original home.

387
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:13.000
before I made my way through
the bad country of Yellowstone.

388
00:23:33.412 --> 00:23:36.371
- It's hot.
- Bacon and eggs at 5:30.

389
00:23:41.681 --> 00:23:42.943
In Tschiffely's Ride.

390
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.293
there is a beautiful black and white photo

391
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:50.472
of him crossing a suspension
bridge with Gato in Bolivia.

392
00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:53.388
It was the first time where I was like.

393
00:23:53.432 --> 00:23:58.524
"Holy shit. I'm doing this."

394
00:23:58.567 --> 00:24:01.396
Here I was.
feeling the bridge sway.

395
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.400
you know. hearing
the river underneath us.

396
00:24:05.444 --> 00:24:07.054
Wow!

397
00:24:07.097 --> 00:24:11.537
That's a nice view.

398
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.104
You could just see
how strong these animals are.

399
00:24:14.148 --> 00:24:16.106
Sometimes. like. we couldn't
even climb up the mountain;

400
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.760
We'd be holding on their tails

401
00:24:17.804 --> 00:24:20.894
and they'd be pulling us up.

402
00:24:20.937 --> 00:24:23.418
On our last river crossing
in Yellowstone.

403
00:24:23.462 --> 00:24:26.421
Frenchie ended up
hurting his stifle really bad.

404
00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.423
which forced us
to haul the horses back

405
00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:29.903
to Copper Spring Ranch

406
00:24:29.946 --> 00:24:32.906
so we could figure out
what to do next.

407
00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.915
Frenchie was
the Dwayne Johnson of the group.

408
00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:45.484
Super strong.
that horse is so good-looking.

409
00:24:45.527 --> 00:24:49.270
but at the same time. he was just a mess.

410
00:24:49.313 --> 00:24:52.099
He loved to eat;
He would fart all the time;

411
00:24:52.142 --> 00:24:53.970
He snored while he slept.

412
00:24:54.014 --> 00:24:57.931
He was the comedic relief.

413
00:25:01.108 --> 00:25:02.544
So. Copper Spring Ranch.

414
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:04.285
they're gonna lend me two other horses

415
00:25:04.328 --> 00:25:07.114
so I can take them
on the trip and continue

416
00:25:07.157 --> 00:25:09.769
while these guys
rest up and get better.

417
00:25:09.812 --> 00:25:12.467
I knew all along that was gonna
be one of the hardest parts

418
00:25:12.511 --> 00:25:14.164
of this trip. was my horses' health.

419
00:25:14.208 --> 00:25:15.296
especially going through mountains

420
00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:16.950
like we did in Yellowstone.

421
00:25:16.993 --> 00:25:19.126
But luckily I can give them the time off

422
00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:21.215
and not push them
and hurt them even more.

423
00:25:21.302 --> 00:25:23.696
That's the most important part.

424
00:25:23.783 --> 00:25:25.828
After travelling for
weeks with these horses.

425
00:25:25.872 --> 00:25:28.962
it was very disheartening
to have to train new horses...

426
00:25:29.005 --> 00:25:33.357
and worse. leave one of my kids.
Frenchie. behind.

427
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.538
What you have to remember is

428
00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:41.583
that horses are natural nomads.

429
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.672
Wild horses travel

430
00:25:43.716 --> 00:25:45.544
20. 30. 40 miles a day

431
00:25:45.587 --> 00:25:49.330
in search of grass and water.

432
00:25:49.373 --> 00:25:52.899
So. when you take a horse
and you take a human.

433
00:25:52.986 --> 00:25:55.858
like Frenchie and Filipe.

434
00:25:55.902 --> 00:25:57.817
and you put them together.

435
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.342
and you aim them
in the same direction every day.

436
00:26:01.385 --> 00:26:07.348
a new herd ethic develops.

437
00:26:07.391 --> 00:26:09.872
So. in exchange for transportation.

438
00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:15.443
the horse gives
unquestioning loyalty and love.

439
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.360
Filipe's emotional bond
with his horses

440
00:26:19.403 --> 00:26:23.233
is so deep that it's affected
his life forever.

441
00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:40.773
Kids ask me all the time.

442
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.557
"How do you go
to the bathroom?".

443
00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:44.428
"What do you carry
in your pack saddle?".

444
00:26:44.472 --> 00:26:45.865
and "How do you shower?"

445
00:26:45.908 --> 00:26:48.389
Of course I tell them I don't shower.

446
00:26:48.432 --> 00:26:50.130
at which point they all wanna sign up

447
00:26:50.217 --> 00:26:52.611
and go with me on this journey.

448
00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:54.090
Woo!

449
00:26:54.134 --> 00:26:56.136
In Wyoming I got
this really cool experience

450
00:26:56.223 --> 00:26:58.921
as a cowboy
to work in a cattle ranch.

451
00:27:01.402 --> 00:27:02.621
And before I left.

452
00:27:02.664 --> 00:27:04.710
the rancher Maryl was like.
"You know what?

453
00:27:04.753 --> 00:27:07.887
"A trip like yours could
really use a third horse."

454
00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.716
His name is Texas.

455
00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:13.109
A really nice rancher here in Wyoming

456
00:27:13.153 --> 00:27:15.721
has offered to donate him
so I can have three horses

457
00:27:15.764 --> 00:27:18.245
and alternate which one I ride.
which one I pack.

458
00:27:18.288 --> 00:27:21.074
so one horse is always
getting a break every day.

459
00:27:21.117 --> 00:27:25.731
It's an amazing offer.
and we'll see how he does.

460
00:27:31.432 --> 00:27:35.001
When I was crossing from
Southern Wyoming into Colorado.

461
00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:40.136
I crossed this huge mountain.

462
00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.618
I was by myself for five days.

463
00:27:47.013 --> 00:27:49.624
When I came down from that mountain.

464
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:53.193
I came to a town called Savery.

465
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.629
You know those sci-fi movies

466
00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:57.371
where you come back to Earth
and everyone's gone?

467
00:27:57.458 --> 00:27:59.112
That's what it felt like.

468
00:27:59.155 --> 00:28:01.680
Riding around this town.
there was no one.

469
00:28:01.723 --> 00:28:03.638
And then the sign literally said.

470
00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:06.685
"Savery. population: 25."

471
00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:13.474
I met this elderly fellow.

472
00:28:13.517 --> 00:28:15.781
He was a very lonely man.
you could tell very quickly.

473
00:28:15.824 --> 00:28:16.825
living by himself.

474
00:28:16.869 --> 00:28:18.348
His name was Sam.

475
00:28:18.392 --> 00:28:20.307
My dad was born here.

476
00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.962
I was born in Dickson.
four miles away.

477
00:28:23.005 --> 00:28:25.486
Took me 78 years to go 4 miles;

478
00:28:25.529 --> 00:28:28.402
That's not very good mileage.

479
00:28:28.489 --> 00:28:30.752
The only thing
he said to me. Sam. was.

480
00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:32.536
"Whatever you do.

481
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.323
"you don't ride across
the million-dollar highway."

482
00:28:39.021 --> 00:28:41.415
But the problem is that
we needed to get south quick

483
00:28:41.502 --> 00:28:43.330
because of the winter.

484
00:28:43.373 --> 00:28:47.726
The winter in northern US
could have stopped the trip.

485
00:28:47.769 --> 00:28:51.338
In the morning. the horses'
buckets were freezing.

486
00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:53.775
It got to the point where.
a couple weeks later.

487
00:28:53.862 --> 00:28:55.516
the only thing I could do

488
00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:59.041
was cross
the million-dollar highway.

489
00:29:02.218 --> 00:29:04.177
I go to the tourists' office

490
00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.049
to ask what they think
the best time to do it is.

491
00:29:07.093 --> 00:29:09.835
She's like. "No. no. no.
you can't. it's too dangerous!"

492
00:29:09.878 --> 00:29:11.924
Like. "The turns are too tight;
There's no guardrail."

493
00:29:12.011 --> 00:29:14.796
I was like. "No. no. I'm not
trailing them. I'm riding them."

494
00:29:14.883 --> 00:29:17.016
She's like. "You're what?!"

495
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.372
It's 4 o'clock in the morning.

496
00:29:25.415 --> 00:29:27.200
we're just outside of Ouray.

497
00:29:27.243 --> 00:29:29.593
about to get on
the million-dollar highway

498
00:29:29.637 --> 00:29:31.378
headed over to Silverton.

499
00:29:31.421 --> 00:29:33.249
It's gonna be a very
scary part of the trip:

500
00:29:33.293 --> 00:29:36.035
11.000 feet. very narrow roads.

501
00:29:36.078 --> 00:29:37.471
and a lot of cars.

502
00:29:37.558 --> 00:29:39.778
So that's why we're leaving so early.

503
00:29:39.821 --> 00:29:42.084
Let's go.
Come on.

504
00:29:42.128 --> 00:29:47.307
We start in pitch black.

505
00:29:47.394 --> 00:29:50.049
And all I can see is that
there's a huge drop to my right.

506
00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:55.141
but I can't see how far it goes.

507
00:29:55.228 --> 00:29:56.882
Then when the sun starts coming up.

508
00:29:56.925 --> 00:29:59.145
I actually see what's around me.

509
00:29:59.232 --> 00:30:00.450
and it's just so scary.

510
00:30:00.494 --> 00:30:02.888
It's literally just like a drop.

511
00:30:06.282 --> 00:30:10.069
There's a rock face here.
and abyss here.

512
00:30:10.112 --> 00:30:13.420
so if my horses get scared.
they're gonna run for the abyss

513
00:30:13.463 --> 00:30:17.467
and I need to jump off
and try to survive.

514
00:30:21.863 --> 00:30:23.996
We start climbing.

515
00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:26.085
It's so quiet and so cold.

516
00:30:26.128 --> 00:30:28.348
There's very few cars.
but every time a car goes by.

517
00:30:28.435 --> 00:30:30.654
we're just like holding our breath.

518
00:30:30.698 --> 00:30:33.832
and the horses are okay.

519
00:30:38.532 --> 00:30:41.361
I finally got over
the million-dollar highway pass.

520
00:30:41.448 --> 00:30:45.626
but the Colorado winter was
quickly creeping up on me.

521
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:47.802
We're like at seven. eight
thousand feet here.

522
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.282
so we're still in the high country

523
00:30:49.325 --> 00:30:50.979
and they're calling for snow tonight.

524
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.508
I'm just excited
to get off this mountain.

525
00:30:58.552 --> 00:30:59.945
It's freezing.

526
00:30:59.988 --> 00:31:03.339
Gonna give the horses something to eat now.

527
00:31:04.906 --> 00:31:07.300
After three more days of
riding through these mountains.

528
00:31:07.343 --> 00:31:11.304
I was able to get to lower
ground where it warmed up.

529
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:30.497
I remember
from my backpacking days

530
00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.065
that there was a website
called Couchsurfing.

531
00:31:33.152 --> 00:31:35.154
And sure enough. there was a guy there

532
00:31:35.197 --> 00:31:37.721
from Southern Colorado
called Peter Lisker.

533
00:31:37.765 --> 00:31:40.376
I messaged him. he messaged me
back right away;

534
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.944
He's like. "Yeah. for sure.
you can stay at my house."

535
00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:44.032
Really nice fellow.

536
00:31:44.076 --> 00:31:47.383
I think he only wore Hawaiian shirts.

537
00:31:50.691 --> 00:31:53.172
Before I left his house.
I noticed that he was like...

538
00:31:53.215 --> 00:31:55.348
kinda weird?

539
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:58.568
My sister Naomi was beautiful.

540
00:31:58.612 --> 00:32:02.703
She was intelligent. witty.

541
00:32:02.746 --> 00:32:04.748
very strong-willed.

542
00:32:04.792 --> 00:32:07.795
and she loved horses.

543
00:32:07.882 --> 00:32:11.233
She passed away in March.

544
00:32:11.277 --> 00:32:14.933
This is pretty much
what I've got left of her.

545
00:32:14.976 --> 00:32:20.199
She would be thrilled to
be going for one last ride.

546
00:32:20.242 --> 00:32:23.724
So. this is Naomi.

547
00:32:23.767 --> 00:32:25.421
I'm gonna take her on one last ride.

548
00:32:25.465 --> 00:32:27.380
and hopefully she'll be able
to make it all the way

549
00:32:27.423 --> 00:32:28.598
to Brazil with me.

550
00:32:28.642 --> 00:32:30.383
Gonna put her in the pack saddle.

551
00:32:30.426 --> 00:32:32.385
and I should be
sharing this journey with her

552
00:32:32.428 --> 00:32:34.648
because she was very
passionate about horses.

553
00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:37.738
so we have something in common.

554
00:32:37.781 --> 00:32:39.044
To Naomi. I'll just say.

555
00:32:39.087 --> 00:32:42.264
"Happy trails.
and until we meet again."

556
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:52.492
The life of a lonely long rider.

557
00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:55.234
Being alone. it's kinda like

558
00:32:55.277 --> 00:32:57.018
having a little pebble in your boot.

559
00:32:57.105 --> 00:32:58.411
You're not gonna get down.

560
00:32:58.454 --> 00:33:00.326
You're tired.
you're gonna keep riding.

561
00:33:00.413 --> 00:33:02.589
and that pebble starts to grow.

562
00:33:02.632 --> 00:33:05.418
and it's all you can think about.

563
00:33:05.461 --> 00:33:07.986
Now you're playing with it.
and you're moving it around.

564
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:09.770
And the pebble becomes a boulder.

565
00:33:09.813 --> 00:33:12.468
And the pain is there.
but you're trying to hide it

566
00:33:12.512 --> 00:33:17.996
with other things. but you can't
stop thinking about the pebble.

567
00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:19.432
Loneliness is like that.

568
00:33:19.475 --> 00:33:22.609
It just engulfs you.

569
00:33:28.484 --> 00:33:31.009
The deepest scars I have in my soul

570
00:33:31.052 --> 00:33:34.316
came from all that time
that I spent alone.

571
00:33:35.448 --> 00:33:36.623
Whoa. whoa!

572
00:33:36.666 --> 00:33:39.887
It's the perfect
recipe for craziness.

573
00:33:39.974 --> 00:33:42.107
We need fucking water!

574
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.630
You have to literally live it...

575
00:33:43.673 --> 00:33:44.892
Fuck!

576
00:33:44.979 --> 00:33:46.676
...and
feel that solitude

577
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.548
pressing against your skin.

578
00:33:48.635 --> 00:33:51.290
and that's the only way that
you can really understand

579
00:33:51.333 --> 00:33:54.467
what impact being out there by yourself

580
00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.556
for such long periods of time can have

581
00:33:56.643 --> 00:34:01.126
on a human being. on a long rider.

582
00:34:01.169 --> 00:34:03.128
Another big lesson from this trip

583
00:34:03.171 --> 00:34:05.565
is that life is meant to be shared.

584
00:34:05.652 --> 00:34:07.828
It could be the most beautiful. colourful.

585
00:34:07.871 --> 00:34:10.657
epic sunset in the world.

586
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.659
but when you're
eating your ramen noodles.

587
00:34:12.702 --> 00:34:15.227
sitting on top of your
panniers by yourself.

588
00:34:15.314 --> 00:34:16.837
it just doesn't seem as colourful

589
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:22.190
as when you're
sharing it with someone.

590
00:34:22.234 --> 00:34:24.845
Riding from Bernalillo
out of Albuquerque today.

591
00:34:24.888 --> 00:34:28.849
I got Emma with me.

592
00:34:28.892 --> 00:34:31.025
How's it going back there?

593
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:33.158
It's awesome!

594
00:34:33.201 --> 00:34:36.030
So. having Emma come
out to meet me in New Mexico

595
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.902
was amazing.

596
00:34:43.907 --> 00:34:46.693
Emma. what happened this
morning with you and Texas here?

597
00:34:46.736 --> 00:34:48.260
Got on the horse.

598
00:34:48.347 --> 00:34:49.957
started to walk away out of the driveway.

599
00:34:50.044 --> 00:34:51.350
and got bucked off.

600
00:34:51.393 --> 00:34:52.742
She's officially a cowgirl now.

601
00:34:52.786 --> 00:34:54.222
I'm proud of you.

602
00:34:54.266 --> 00:34:56.703
You stayed on really... oh.
I was so scared when I saw.

603
00:34:56.746 --> 00:34:58.705
And luckily. I was
able to get Frenchie back

604
00:34:58.748 --> 00:35:00.968
after his month of resting.

605
00:35:08.889 --> 00:35:11.457
It was a beautiful day.

606
00:35:11.544 --> 00:35:14.634
Came to a locked gate
on the trail we were following.

607
00:35:14.721 --> 00:35:17.071
and because it was gonna
take so long to go back.

608
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:18.594
I started looking for alternatives.

609
00:35:18.638 --> 00:35:21.597
and I saw this field that would
take me back to the trail.

610
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:23.599
so I thought.
"Hey. I could just ride across."

611
00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:26.472
It had some tall weeds on it.

612
00:35:26.559 --> 00:35:29.779
A few metres into this field...

613
00:35:29.823 --> 00:35:31.564
Fuck!

614
00:35:31.607 --> 00:35:35.089
Bruiser's stuck
in a big hole behind me.

615
00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:37.135
I'm gonna try and get him out.

616
00:35:37.178 --> 00:35:38.223
I...
I didn't see this.

617
00:35:38.266 --> 00:35:39.789
The grass is really deep.

618
00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:41.617
He freaked out
and tried to turn around.

619
00:35:41.661 --> 00:35:43.010
but it all happened so quickly.

620
00:35:43.097 --> 00:35:44.664
Come on. buddy.

621
00:35:47.101 --> 00:35:48.407
- Careful!
- Come on!

622
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.452
Ready?

623
00:35:50.496 --> 00:35:53.629
One. two. three.

624
00:35:53.673 --> 00:35:55.109
Come on. buddy.

625
00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:57.851
Come on. come on!

626
00:35:57.938 --> 00:35:59.983
Come on. Bruiser. come on.

627
00:36:00.027 --> 00:36:01.942
Come on!

628
00:36:01.985 --> 00:36:03.335
Fuck!

629
00:36:03.422 --> 00:36:05.250
My heart was
trying to punch its way

630
00:36:05.293 --> 00:36:06.773
out of my ribcage. you know?

631
00:36:06.816 --> 00:36:08.992
Come on. buddy!
Come on. come on. Bruiser!

632
00:36:09.036 --> 00:36:11.038
- Come on. buddy!
- Come on!

633
00:36:11.125 --> 00:36:12.953
You're okay. buddy.

634
00:36:12.996 --> 00:36:15.434
You're okay.
Gonna get you out of here.

635
00:36:15.477 --> 00:36:17.305
I managed to wiggle him around.

636
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:19.786
took the saddle off
to lighten up the load.

637
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:22.963
I dug the ditch a little bit.
and then I jumped out and said.

638
00:36:23.006 --> 00:36:24.443
"Alright. Bruiser.
I'm gonna count to three.

639
00:36:24.486 --> 00:36:27.446
"and on three.
you jump out of there."

640
00:36:27.489 --> 00:36:31.014
Oh. yes!

641
00:36:31.058 --> 00:36:32.320
Luckily. he was okay.

642
00:36:32.364 --> 00:36:36.063
Didn't hurt himself. miraculously.

643
00:36:53.907 --> 00:36:58.520
Well. he was riding down
the bar ditch going through 85

644
00:36:58.564 --> 00:37:01.088
and I passed him when I was
going to work that morning.

645
00:37:01.175 --> 00:37:02.698
and then when
I come back that evening

646
00:37:02.742 --> 00:37:04.352
I stopped and talked to him.

647
00:37:04.396 --> 00:37:07.007
We passed another man right up
the road here a while ago

648
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:08.356
on a bicycle.

649
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.749
I didn't stop to talk to him.

650
00:37:09.836 --> 00:37:11.185
He didn't have a horse!

651
00:37:11.229 --> 00:37:14.188
We didn't have anything
in common to talk about.

652
00:37:19.715 --> 00:37:22.501
We're in the middle
of nowhere in Texas.

653
00:37:22.544 --> 00:37:24.720
and all of a sudden. I see hanging

654
00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:26.374
on this barbed wire fence.

655
00:37:26.418 --> 00:37:30.335
there's all these laminated
pages with photos on them.

656
00:37:30.378 --> 00:37:33.903
We meet Neta.
an animal rights advocate.

657
00:37:33.947 --> 00:37:37.603
She tells me that a couple days
earlier she saw me riding.

658
00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:41.694
pulled out her camera.
and takes this beautiful photo.

659
00:37:44.392 --> 00:37:46.220
We met and she showed me
the photograph

660
00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:48.440
and told me
the story about the wall.

661
00:37:48.527 --> 00:37:50.355
He was in a feedlot

662
00:37:50.398 --> 00:37:53.967
and the investigator said he kept watching

663
00:37:54.054 --> 00:37:56.709
for his owner
to come back and get him.

664
00:37:56.752 --> 00:37:59.973
And then he ended up killed by.

665
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.714
And that's the Wall of Hope.

666
00:38:01.757 --> 00:38:05.805
which she started to tell
the story of how horses

667
00:38:05.892 --> 00:38:10.723
can have an impact
and change people's lives.

668
00:38:10.766 --> 00:38:14.248
More than 90.000 horses already
this year have been taken down

669
00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:15.945
to Mexico for slaughter.

670
00:38:15.989 --> 00:38:18.078
but the problem is that the manner

671
00:38:18.121 --> 00:38:19.819
in which these horses are transported

672
00:38:19.906 --> 00:38:23.910
and handled are very inhumane.

673
00:38:23.953 --> 00:38:26.129
It makes me sad that I'm. you know.

674
00:38:26.173 --> 00:38:28.828
riding the same way
that these thousands of horses

675
00:38:28.915 --> 00:38:31.265
are being taken to be
slaughtered in Mexico.

676
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:33.354
But this is a really cool initiative

677
00:38:33.441 --> 00:38:35.922
so people remember them.

678
00:38:42.972 --> 00:38:45.018
Are you excited to
go home for a little while?

679
00:38:45.105 --> 00:38:46.802
Excited. no.

680
00:38:46.846 --> 00:38:49.327
But. you know. you have
a two-year journey.

681
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.155
so I have all kinds of time
to meet you again.

682
00:38:56.159 --> 00:38:57.770
Today is kind of a happy day.

683
00:38:57.813 --> 00:38:59.641
but also a little bit of sadness.

684
00:38:59.685 --> 00:39:01.469
I'm saying goodbye to Texas.

685
00:39:01.513 --> 00:39:05.647
He's just not as big or strong
as Frenchie and Bruiser.

686
00:39:05.691 --> 00:39:08.694
so I'm trading him out
for a new horse. a mustang.

687
00:39:08.781 --> 00:39:11.653
He's a native American
wild horse.

688
00:39:11.697 --> 00:39:13.307
which is even cooler for me

689
00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:15.048
because there's just so much history there.

690
00:39:15.135 --> 00:39:17.616
I'm so happy to have Dude.

691
00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:21.402
When Tschiffely went on his
ride. he took two Criollos.

692
00:39:21.489 --> 00:39:24.971
the wild horses of South America.

693
00:39:25.014 --> 00:39:27.539
He would say how important that was.

694
00:39:27.626 --> 00:39:29.454
that these horses
had that wild instinct.

695
00:39:29.497 --> 00:39:32.805
how important it was for their survival.

696
00:39:57.046 --> 00:39:59.484
When Canadians
and Americans would tell me.

697
00:39:59.527 --> 00:40:01.007
"You're gonna cross Mexico on a horse?

698
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:02.443
"You're gonna die." I would ask them.

699
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:04.097
"Have you ever been to Mexico?"

700
00:40:04.184 --> 00:40:07.013
And each time. they replied no.

701
00:40:07.056 --> 00:40:10.016
But then. as I got into
the southern part of the US.

702
00:40:10.059 --> 00:40:13.019
every Mexican family I met.

703
00:40:13.062 --> 00:40:16.675
they told me I was
gonna be killed in Mexico.

704
00:40:16.718 --> 00:40:19.895
I was forced to wait at
the border at a cattle stockyard

705
00:40:19.939 --> 00:40:23.856
where the slaughter horses
stay before entering Mexico.

706
00:40:23.899 --> 00:40:25.684
My horses did not feel
comfortable there

707
00:40:25.727 --> 00:40:27.381
the entire time.

708
00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:30.036
It was as if they could smell the fear.

709
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:34.083
You can only legally take
two horses into Mexico.

710
00:40:34.127 --> 00:40:39.045
Dude was actually ridden across
by a kid named Jesus.

711
00:40:39.088 --> 00:40:40.873
I put him into Jesus's hand.

712
00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:42.962
and he took
the horse in 15 minutes

713
00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:45.704
and he's like. "Yup!
Dude is in Mexico!"

714
00:40:45.747 --> 00:40:48.228
And then the other two horses.
because they were going legally.

715
00:40:48.271 --> 00:40:50.535
it's paperwork. it's the vet.
and you call. you do this.

716
00:40:50.578 --> 00:40:53.538
you do that...

717
00:40:53.581 --> 00:40:56.889
After two weeks. I finally
got the horses into Mexico

718
00:40:56.932 --> 00:41:01.284
and my dad was waiting for me
on the other side in Ojinaga.

719
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.428
Day one in Mexico!

720
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:16.561
We're headed towards Jimenez.

721
00:41:16.604 --> 00:41:18.911
We'll probably be there...
I don't even know. ten days.

722
00:41:18.954 --> 00:41:22.741
seven days.
Only God knows.

723
00:41:22.784 --> 00:41:24.351
My dad was gonna ride with me

724
00:41:24.438 --> 00:41:27.833
through the northern part of Mexico.

725
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.313
- How you feeling?
- I feel good.

726
00:41:30.357 --> 00:41:32.925
First day. not too tired.

727
00:41:32.968 --> 00:41:34.317
And. I don't know.

728
00:41:34.361 --> 00:41:35.971
let's see by the end of the week.

729
00:41:36.015 --> 00:41:38.539
I can tell you better.

730
00:41:38.626 --> 00:41:42.282
This was my dad's dream
way before it was my own.

731
00:41:42.325 --> 00:41:44.153
My dad learned of the story
of Aimé Tschiffely

732
00:41:44.197 --> 00:41:46.460
when he was a young kid.

733
00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:49.594
In a way. I was living
the dream for the both of us.

734
00:41:49.637 --> 00:41:53.467
Right now.
I'm just missing my shower.

735
00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:56.992
I'd love to have a shower now
and get a nice bath.

736
00:41:57.036 --> 00:42:00.169
but that's how it is.

737
00:42:04.783 --> 00:42:06.045
Crossing the Chihuahua desert.

738
00:42:06.132 --> 00:42:09.135
that's where 90 percent
of the drugs that go from

739
00:42:09.178 --> 00:42:12.486
South America through
that corridor in Central America

740
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.228
and Mexico into the US and Canada.

741
00:42:15.315 --> 00:42:19.319
so it's a very dangerous place.

742
00:42:19.362 --> 00:42:22.148
On the first day
we're riding in Mexico.

743
00:42:22.191 --> 00:42:26.631
we were interrogated by the police.

744
00:42:26.674 --> 00:42:29.024
"Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
we're riding horses to Brazil!"

745
00:42:29.068 --> 00:42:31.853
"What's in the pack saddle?"
We tell them.

746
00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:34.334
They calmed down.
They were horsemen themselves.

747
00:42:34.377 --> 00:42:35.683
I heard a couple of them talking. like.

748
00:42:35.727 --> 00:42:37.859
which horse they liked better.

749
00:42:37.903 --> 00:42:40.688
They let us go.

750
00:42:48.391 --> 00:42:50.089
At night time.
we were pitching our tent

751
00:42:50.176 --> 00:42:51.351
in the middle of nowhere.

752
00:42:51.394 --> 00:42:53.179
We didn't know if this was a route that

753
00:42:53.222 --> 00:42:54.876
the drug traffickers were
gonna be coming through;

754
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:58.184
We didn't know if someone
was gonna take us hostage...

755
00:42:58.227 --> 00:43:02.667
or kill us.

756
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:06.235
My dad and I had a long talk
about how we cannot accept

757
00:43:06.279 --> 00:43:10.196
any help from anyone that's
working with the drug traffic.

758
00:43:10.239 --> 00:43:14.548
My dad makes it very clear
that's the number one rule.

759
00:43:21.903 --> 00:43:25.167
That afternoon.
we get to a little village.

760
00:44:01.943 --> 00:44:03.597
It's like -3 outside.

761
00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:08.602
and this guy's got
a house with heaters in it.

762
00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:11.649
The number one rule went
straight out the window.

763
00:44:11.692 --> 00:44:14.652
We slept at his house.

764
00:45:35.515 --> 00:45:38.170
My dad's gone ahead
to see if we can find a place.

765
00:45:38.213 --> 00:45:41.347
if there's a ranch or something up there.

766
00:45:44.567 --> 00:45:47.179
It was really late.
and I was tired.

767
00:45:47.222 --> 00:45:51.270
and I left the panniers
inside where I put the horses.

768
00:45:51.357 --> 00:45:53.925
Alright. going to sleep.

769
00:45:54.012 --> 00:45:58.625
Hope for the best.

770
00:45:58.712 --> 00:46:00.627
When I woke up in the morning
and unzipped my tent.

771
00:46:00.714 --> 00:46:02.934
Frenchie had
knocked over the panniers

772
00:46:03.021 --> 00:46:05.023
with Naomi's ashes.

773
00:46:05.066 --> 00:46:07.373
And now he was eating
Naomi's ashes. and I'm like.

774
00:46:07.416 --> 00:46:10.028
"Oh my God."

775
00:46:10.071 --> 00:46:13.640
I get Frenchie off the ashes.
put the ashes back.

776
00:46:13.727 --> 00:46:17.252
say a "Hail Mary." apologize to Naomi.

777
00:46:30.744 --> 00:46:35.662
We. as sons. we have
a hard time with our fathers.

778
00:46:35.749 --> 00:46:39.231
I think because
we're so similar to them.

779
00:46:39.274 --> 00:46:41.581
My dad and I were
in the middle of this desert.

780
00:46:41.624 --> 00:46:45.846
and one day we're
talking about Palominos.

781
00:46:45.933 --> 00:46:48.675
One guy said Palomino was just a colour.

782
00:46:48.762 --> 00:46:51.591
the other guy said Palomino
was a colour and a breed.

783
00:46:51.634 --> 00:46:54.812
and we had this. like.
tempestuous fight.

784
00:46:54.855 --> 00:46:56.335
Like. it all blew up

785
00:46:56.422 --> 00:46:59.642
and we didn't talk to each other all day.

786
00:46:59.686 --> 00:47:02.602
It's crazy how when
you're suffering so much

787
00:47:02.645 --> 00:47:04.473
and you're out there
and there's so much unknown.

788
00:47:04.517 --> 00:47:07.433
how something so little and minute

789
00:47:07.476 --> 00:47:09.478
as a horse or a breed can become

790
00:47:09.522 --> 00:47:13.569
this epic battle.

791
00:47:34.547 --> 00:47:36.679
No one celebrated
the journey like the Mexicans.

792
00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:50.650
Every town we rode into.
people just started showing up.

793
00:47:56.003 --> 00:48:01.530
Some days we'd have
five people riding with us.

794
00:48:01.574 --> 00:48:04.707
Some days seven.

795
00:48:13.368 --> 00:48:17.590
And one day. we had a thousand
horsemen and women

796
00:48:17.677 --> 00:48:21.028
saddle their horses and ride with us.

797
00:48:24.684 --> 00:48:25.946
To see that many animals.

798
00:48:26.033 --> 00:48:29.341
that many horse
people together...

799
00:48:34.694 --> 00:48:37.175
May God our father

800
00:48:37.218 --> 00:48:40.178
and the holy spirit watch over you.

801
00:48:40.221 --> 00:48:42.615
It's funny.
here they turned my trip into

802
00:48:42.702 --> 00:48:44.530
a trip for peace. and I understand it

803
00:48:44.573 --> 00:48:46.227
because the people
are so desperate for it.

804
00:48:46.271 --> 00:48:47.881
and they need some hope.

805
00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:51.537
And if I can give them
a little bit. then that's cool.

806
00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.888
It's just amazing.
I don't even know what to say.

807
00:48:57.369 --> 00:48:59.719
I can't say thank you
enough for the cabalgantes

808
00:48:59.762 --> 00:49:01.634
here from Rio Grande.

809
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:03.810
gave us these really nice shirts.

810
00:49:03.897 --> 00:49:06.465
and have welcomed us like family here.

811
00:49:06.552 --> 00:49:08.075
It's been like that all over Mexico.

812
00:49:08.119 --> 00:49:09.772
It's so nice.

813
00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.831
Today. I am feeling
that I have 100 pounds

814
00:49:24.918 --> 00:49:27.399
over my shoulders.

815
00:49:27.442 --> 00:49:29.749
My dad was a champion.

816
00:49:29.792 --> 00:49:32.056
At his age. to become
a long rider. you know.

817
00:49:32.099 --> 00:49:34.232
he rode more than
1.000 miles consecutively.

818
00:49:34.275 --> 00:49:37.931
It was amazing.

819
00:49:50.944 --> 00:49:53.773
My dad is very religious.

820
00:49:53.816 --> 00:49:56.080
He had cancer. and he truly believes

821
00:49:56.123 --> 00:49:59.344
that it was his prayers
that cured him.

822
00:49:59.431 --> 00:50:03.609
It was very important
for him to finish the journey

823
00:50:03.652 --> 00:50:06.655
at the Basilica of Guadalupe
to thank her.

824
00:50:06.699 --> 00:50:09.180
He thanked the saints for keeping us safe.

825
00:50:09.267 --> 00:50:11.617
and asked her to continue
to watch over me.

826
00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:16.187
as I had more than half
of the journey still ahead.

827
00:50:16.274 --> 00:50:18.319
I guess once he was with me

828
00:50:18.363 --> 00:50:20.626
and he saw what the journey was.

829
00:50:20.669 --> 00:50:23.629
he realized how dangerous
it was for his son

830
00:50:23.672 --> 00:50:26.893
and that I may not make it to Brazil.

831
00:50:41.386 --> 00:50:44.345
When people think about
what I do. it becomes romantic.

832
00:50:44.389 --> 00:50:47.131
It's a guy on a horse
galloping through the jungle

833
00:50:47.174 --> 00:50:52.223
or in the woods. in the mountain
tops. and the birds...

834
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:54.312
There were so many close calls.

835
00:50:54.355 --> 00:50:57.141
It's the worst!
Fuck.

836
00:50:57.184 --> 00:50:59.012
There was points
where I was riding these horses

837
00:50:59.056 --> 00:51:00.579
on roads where if stuck out my arm

838
00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:02.146
those trucks would have hit me.

839
00:51:02.189 --> 00:51:04.670
Holy fuck.

840
00:51:04.713 --> 00:51:07.194
Aimé Tschiffely gets to Texas.

841
00:51:07.238 --> 00:51:11.503
and he shuts the trip down
because of the car traffic.

842
00:51:11.546 --> 00:51:14.332
A car actually almost
hits one of his horses

843
00:51:14.375 --> 00:51:17.378
and he gets so aggravated
and so scared of the traffic

844
00:51:17.422 --> 00:51:20.164
in 1928 at this point.

845
00:51:20.207 --> 00:51:21.948
he says. "No. no. I'm pulling the plug.

846
00:51:22.035 --> 00:51:23.341
"I'm trailing
the rest of the way."

847
00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:26.909
I'm just so happy
I came out of that alive.

848
00:51:26.953 --> 00:51:29.129
Thank you. baby Jesus.

849
00:51:29.216 --> 00:51:32.567
Wow.

850
00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:34.352
Southern Mexico.

851
00:51:34.395 --> 00:51:37.224
that's when
the suffering got real.

852
00:51:43.535 --> 00:51:46.277
Torrential downpour right now.

853
00:51:46.364 --> 00:51:48.061
Luckily.
I found a restaurant here

854
00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:51.195
that let me tie the horses up
and put my tent...

855
00:51:58.985 --> 00:52:01.248
Alright. so...

856
00:52:01.292 --> 00:52:04.208
today was possibly

857
00:52:04.251 --> 00:52:07.211
the worst day of my life.

858
00:52:16.437 --> 00:52:20.137
One second is all it takes.

859
00:52:25.142 --> 00:52:29.624
Oh. God...

860
00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:38.111
I was inside the restaurant.

861
00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:43.247
talking to the people who ran the place.

862
00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:46.511
and all of a sudden
the guy I was talking to said.

863
00:52:46.598 --> 00:52:49.862
"Hey. man..."
he said.

864
00:52:49.949 --> 00:52:52.604
"Your horse
is going on the road."

865
00:52:52.647 --> 00:52:54.432
And I turned around and I saw Frenchie

866
00:52:54.475 --> 00:52:57.435
walking around on the highway.

867
00:52:57.478 --> 00:53:00.612
and I ran out of the door
and I ran towards him.

868
00:53:00.655 --> 00:53:02.962
and before I could even get close.

869
00:53:03.005 --> 00:53:05.660
I saw a car.

870
00:53:05.704 --> 00:53:08.228
I saw a truck...

871
00:53:08.315 --> 00:53:10.143
Frenchie's
just been hit by a car.

872
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:13.364
It's the worst moment of the trip so far.

873
00:53:19.152 --> 00:53:21.633
He fell on top of the hood.

874
00:53:21.676 --> 00:53:24.462
and then fell on the ground.

875
00:53:24.505 --> 00:53:29.162
There were sparks
from his shoes...

876
00:53:29.206 --> 00:53:31.860
the crunching of the hood...

877
00:53:31.904 --> 00:53:35.081
the sound of the car braking...

878
00:53:35.168 --> 00:53:38.084
him scrambling getting back up.
and then he ran towards traffic.

879
00:53:38.171 --> 00:53:40.217
and there was
tractor trailers coming.

880
00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.262
And I ran after him.
and I didn't want to...

881
00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:43.524
I didn't know what to do.

882
00:53:43.568 --> 00:53:45.309
I almost got hit by a truck.

883
00:53:45.352 --> 00:53:47.746
And then the guy that hit him
wanted to charge me

884
00:53:47.833 --> 00:53:50.401
for the damage.
He wanted so much money.

885
00:53:50.488 --> 00:53:53.012
And he wanted to call the cops.

886
00:53:53.055 --> 00:53:56.668
Luckily.
I had just met these charros.

887
00:53:56.711 --> 00:53:59.105
and they gave me their number
literally like 15 minutes

888
00:53:59.192 --> 00:54:00.585
before this all happened.

889
00:54:00.672 --> 00:54:02.891
And I called them.

890
00:54:02.935 --> 00:54:06.678
and they came and helped me
with their trailer.

891
00:54:06.721 --> 00:54:10.551
They brought me to their ranch.
the vet checked Frenchie out.

892
00:54:10.595 --> 00:54:14.555
stitched his lip. which was cut.

893
00:54:14.599 --> 00:54:17.036
His back leg looks pretty bad.

894
00:54:17.079 --> 00:54:19.604
I don't know what's gonna happen now.

895
00:54:19.691 --> 00:54:24.435
Hopefully he'll be okay.

896
00:54:24.522 --> 00:54:25.827
Wow.

897
00:54:42.104 --> 00:54:45.586
I spent one month with Frenchie.

898
00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.807
treating him. feeding him.

899
00:54:48.894 --> 00:54:52.898
He was very scared.

900
00:54:52.941 --> 00:54:55.553
This was a very important moment
of the trip where I learned

901
00:54:55.596 --> 00:54:58.599
that you need to be on top of your horses

902
00:54:58.643 --> 00:55:01.254
all day every day.

903
00:55:01.298 --> 00:55:04.736
When I left Canada. I was an atheist.

904
00:55:04.779 --> 00:55:07.739
I saw the bad side of religion. you know?

905
00:55:07.782 --> 00:55:10.350
I felt that religion started wars;

906
00:55:10.437 --> 00:55:12.439
I felt that religion separated people.

907
00:55:12.483 --> 00:55:14.441
But I tell you what. my friend.

908
00:55:14.485 --> 00:55:16.487
When you think you're gonna die

909
00:55:16.574 --> 00:55:18.097
or you think your animals are gonna die.

910
00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.359
or your kids...

911
00:55:19.446 --> 00:55:21.666
you pray.

912
00:55:21.753 --> 00:55:23.407
And today I believe in God.

913
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:26.845
I don't know what it is.
who it is.

914
00:55:26.932 --> 00:55:30.414
I do feel like now going through
everything I went through.

915
00:55:30.457 --> 00:55:32.851
there has to be something bigger.

916
00:55:32.938 --> 00:55:35.288
There has to be something out there.

917
00:55:38.291 --> 00:55:40.119
The Long Riders Guild maintains

918
00:55:40.162 --> 00:55:43.427
the world's strictest code
of equestrian ethics.

919
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:45.864
and Filipe
is an excellent example

920
00:55:45.951 --> 00:55:47.648
of how a long rider

921
00:55:47.692 --> 00:55:51.609
maintains his ethics.

922
00:55:51.652 --> 00:55:54.481
He always put
the welfare of his horses

923
00:55:54.525 --> 00:55:58.137
before his own ego.

924
00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.312
Frenchie gets very curious

925
00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:02.228
when you start eating in front of him.

926
00:56:13.195 --> 00:56:14.632
Tomorrow. if all goes well.

927
00:56:14.675 --> 00:56:19.027
we'll be going into Guatemala

928
00:56:19.071 --> 00:56:21.465
and hopefully breaking
through this next barrier.

929
00:56:21.508 --> 00:56:24.206
which is going through
Central America.

930
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:26.557
Hopefully it's gonna give us
some life. give me some life.

931
00:56:26.644 --> 00:56:29.864
because right now it's a little
bit of a mental struggle.

932
00:56:29.908 --> 00:56:32.171
For sure. it's tough.

933
00:56:41.006 --> 00:56:42.877
Based on my experience with Mexico

934
00:56:42.921 --> 00:56:44.401
and speaking to different people.

935
00:56:44.444 --> 00:56:46.403
I knew it was going to be
impossible to cross the borders

936
00:56:46.446 --> 00:56:49.362
through Central America legally.

937
00:56:49.406 --> 00:56:51.408
There are viruses that exist.
let's say. in Brazil.

938
00:56:51.451 --> 00:56:53.061
that don't exist here.

939
00:56:53.105 --> 00:56:56.456
So. in order for those viruses
not to spread across borders.

940
00:56:56.543 --> 00:57:00.068
there are a lot of requirements
and laws and quarantine

941
00:57:00.112 --> 00:57:01.679
and exams that need to be done.

942
00:57:01.722 --> 00:57:04.464
every time you cross a border with a horse.

943
00:57:04.551 --> 00:57:06.771
And a lot of these countries
don't even have regulations

944
00:57:06.858 --> 00:57:08.294
when you get to the border.

945
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:10.078
They don't have a form to give you.

946
00:57:10.122 --> 00:57:11.558
You're a guy with three horses

947
00:57:11.602 --> 00:57:16.215
and they see that as an opportunity.

948
00:57:16.258 --> 00:57:19.740
So I started crossing
all of the borders illegally.

949
00:57:19.784 --> 00:57:22.700
They have literally the border.
and then right next to it

950
00:57:22.743 --> 00:57:25.398
they have this little path
where they cross cocaine.

951
00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:29.489
weapons. whatever you want.

952
00:57:29.576 --> 00:57:31.752
At the first border of Mexico/Guatemala

953
00:57:31.796 --> 00:57:34.233
I gave the horses to a guy.

954
00:57:34.276 --> 00:57:37.105
walked over with my boots and my spurs

955
00:57:37.149 --> 00:57:40.239
and horse hairs all over me
to the actual border.

956
00:57:40.282 --> 00:57:43.068
The guy stamped my passport.
didn't ask anything.

957
00:57:43.111 --> 00:57:44.939
I went like 50 metres down.

958
00:57:44.983 --> 00:57:46.332
my horses came out of the jungle.

959
00:57:46.419 --> 00:57:49.553
and I continued on.

960
00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.783
The first town I got to.
La Libertad.

961
00:58:02.827 --> 00:58:06.744
this guy's like. "Hey!
Come. there's been an accident."

962
00:58:06.787 --> 00:58:08.267
There was
a rooster and a chicken

963
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:10.138
in the middle of the road.

964
00:58:10.182 --> 00:58:12.576
There was a guy bleeding to death.

965
00:58:12.619 --> 00:58:15.579
Spectators here talking as if
they're watching a soccer game.

966
00:58:15.622 --> 00:58:17.668
And then I couldn't piece
it together. I'm like.

967
00:58:17.755 --> 00:58:19.365
"Why is there
a rooster and a chicken

968
00:58:19.452 --> 00:58:20.453
"in the middle of the road?"

969
00:58:20.497 --> 00:58:21.759
And then when I asked him.
he's like.

970
00:58:21.802 --> 00:58:23.325
"He stole that chicken
and that rooster.

971
00:58:23.369 --> 00:58:26.633
"That's why they killed him."

972
00:58:26.677 --> 00:58:28.809
And you start to understand
what a life is worth

973
00:58:28.853 --> 00:58:32.987
in Central America.

974
00:58:33.031 --> 00:58:35.381
In Latin America. they tend to
use corn to feed horses

975
00:58:35.468 --> 00:58:39.472
because it's cheaper than buying feed.

976
00:58:39.516 --> 00:58:43.607
But you have to slowly
build it up to them;

977
00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.783
You can't just go there one day
and give them corn.

978
00:58:45.826 --> 00:58:48.481
like this rancher did
in northern Guatemala.

979
00:58:48.525 --> 00:58:50.614
Alright. so right now
I'm really worried.

980
00:58:50.657 --> 00:58:53.530
Bruiser hasn't gone
to the bathroom all day.

981
00:58:53.573 --> 00:58:55.619
He's wanting to lay down.

982
00:58:55.662 --> 00:58:58.186
I've had to get him up
like three times already.

983
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:59.710
So he could be collicking.

984
00:58:59.797 --> 00:59:01.842
I think he's collicking.
I don't know.

985
00:59:01.886 --> 00:59:03.801
Colic happens when
a horse eats something

986
00:59:03.844 --> 00:59:07.500
differently. very quickly.
or when they don't have water.

987
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:08.849
I'm starting to get really worried.

988
00:59:08.893 --> 00:59:11.722
This is a serious problem.

989
00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:13.637
Because horses can't vomit.

990
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:15.726
they start to build up these
gases in their stomach.

991
00:59:15.813 --> 00:59:18.076
If their tummy hurts. they'll start to roll

992
00:59:18.163 --> 00:59:20.644
until the point
where they can't take it.

993
00:59:20.687 --> 00:59:21.993
I hate to think about it.

994
00:59:22.036 --> 00:59:25.170
but a lot of horses have died from colic.

995
00:59:29.914 --> 00:59:31.829
So I called the
vet clinic and they said

996
00:59:31.872 --> 00:59:33.091
they have some medication there.

997
00:59:33.178 --> 00:59:35.397
I'm gonna go over there
and buy it.

998
00:59:37.878 --> 00:59:39.532
A few minutes after. thank God.

999
00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:44.537
he went to the bathroom.
I was getting so worried.

1000
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:46.539
Good job. buddy.

1001
00:59:49.063 --> 00:59:51.196
Bruiser is just this beautiful.

1002
00:59:51.239 --> 00:59:55.548
slick. 007 of the group.

1003
00:59:55.592 --> 00:59:59.378
Super smart.
A horse fit for a king.

1004
00:59:59.421 --> 01:00:01.685
That horse understood me so well.

1005
01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:04.601
You just didn't have to tell
him. he just read your mind.

1006
01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:06.080
And he was just so beautiful.

1007
01:00:06.124 --> 01:00:08.735
He moved so elegantly.

1008
01:00:17.135 --> 01:00:19.659
In southern Guatemala.
I was put in touch with

1009
01:00:19.746 --> 01:00:21.618
the boss of the region

1010
01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:26.057
to get safe passage into Honduras.

1011
01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:28.276
When I started the track here.
I started filming.

1012
01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.975
and a kid came up to me
and was like. I don't know.

1013
01:00:31.062 --> 01:00:33.586
17 years old; He's like.
"Be careful. man.

1014
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:37.764
"don't film a lot here because
the DEA has been coming in here

1015
01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:43.248
"to look for a really big boss
of the narcotráficu

1016
01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:45.772
"and people might
think that you're a spy

1017
01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:47.600
"or you're filming for them."

1018
01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.254
So he said. "If someone
asks what you're doing.

1019
01:00:49.297 --> 01:00:51.604
"just tell them
you're a singer."

1020
01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:53.606
And I'm like. "What if
they ask me to sing?"

1021
01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.435
"Are you nuts?
I'll get shot on the spot!"

1022
01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:03.660
It's impossible to ride.

1023
01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:06.663
It's so hard to get up
this fucking mountain.

1024
01:01:10.144 --> 01:01:12.451
We finally
get to the village where

1025
01:01:12.494 --> 01:01:16.368
my very powerful host was waiting for me.

1026
01:01:16.455 --> 01:01:20.502
He lived in a mansion.
but it was really hard to film

1027
01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:24.942
because I did not feel safe.

1028
01:01:24.985 --> 01:01:28.293
He was drinking a beer
and he tossed me a can.

1029
01:01:28.336 --> 01:01:30.774
and I grabbed it
and he goes. "Llegaste."

1030
01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:33.341
- and I couldn't even talk.
- I was like...

1031
01:01:33.385 --> 01:01:36.649
And I looked at the beer.
it was a blue can.

1032
01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.695
and it was called Salva Vida.

1033
01:01:38.738 --> 01:01:41.654
"Life saver."

1034
01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:45.745
He had his own zoo.

1035
01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:49.009
And along with his men...

1036
01:01:54.014 --> 01:01:55.799
They rode with me
and kept me safe

1037
01:01:55.842 --> 01:01:59.324
through northern Honduras.

1038
01:01:59.367 --> 01:02:01.413
Very few people get the opportunity

1039
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:06.548
to break bread with cartel members.

1040
01:02:06.592 --> 01:02:09.551
You know. your skin colour
may change. your bank account.

1041
01:02:09.595 --> 01:02:14.034
your religion. your nationality.

1042
01:02:14.078 --> 01:02:17.342
the colour of your flag.

1043
01:02:17.385 --> 01:02:19.170
But when you sit
with these people in their home

1044
01:02:19.213 --> 01:02:20.824
and you eat with them.
you realize

1045
01:02:20.867 --> 01:02:24.044
they just want to love
and be loved.

1046
01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:28.353
Humanity is good at its core.

1047
01:02:28.396 --> 01:02:31.704
And that's. I think. the most
special part about this journey.

1048
01:02:40.887 --> 01:02:42.541
I'm staying at this house

1049
01:02:42.584 --> 01:02:46.850
and the wife
of the husband is this like

1050
01:02:46.893 --> 01:02:51.202
drop-dead gorgeous blonde
that's very flirtatious.

1051
01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:55.293
And I get back from the horses one day.

1052
01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:57.251
and she was there by herself.
so she says.

1053
01:02:57.295 --> 01:02:58.775
"What are you doing?"
I'm like. "Nothing."

1054
01:02:58.818 --> 01:03:00.254
She's like. "Do you wanna
have dinner with me?"

1055
01:03:00.298 --> 01:03:01.429
I'm like. "Sure.
let's have dinner!"

1056
01:03:01.473 --> 01:03:03.214
And we have dinner. nothing happens.

1057
01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:05.303
and a couple hours later.
this is a Sunday night.

1058
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:08.262
I'm talking over Skype
with my family.

1059
01:03:08.306 --> 01:03:11.483
and all of a sudden
out of nowhere I hear...

1060
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.420
I started
looking around the room.

1061
01:03:35.463 --> 01:03:37.074
What can I put in front of the door?

1062
01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:41.905
If I jump out the window.
will I survive?

1063
01:03:41.948 --> 01:03:45.473
Two hours after
the police rode in...

1064
01:03:51.305 --> 01:03:54.091
They talked to him.
and then they left.

1065
01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:57.616
She was alive.
He didn't kill her.

1066
01:04:19.159 --> 01:04:22.554
Alright. just entered Nicaragua.

1067
01:04:22.641 --> 01:04:23.947
Feels crazy to be here.

1068
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:25.339
I wish I could have filmed the process.

1069
01:04:25.383 --> 01:04:27.037
I had to pay so much money.

1070
01:04:27.124 --> 01:04:29.517
It was insane.
took me like four hours.

1071
01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:30.997
It sucks.

1072
01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:33.870
I honestly hate every border
I get to. it's the worst.

1073
01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:36.698
But...
Nicaragua. woo!

1074
01:04:48.188 --> 01:04:49.494
Today's a very special day.

1075
01:04:49.537 --> 01:04:52.323
I get to see my mom after two years.

1076
01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:55.326
I miss her a lot.
and she really wants to ride.

1077
01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:58.895
but she has no experience
so it's gonna be hilarious.

1078
01:05:04.204 --> 01:05:06.859
I'll never forget
waiting at the airport for her

1079
01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:11.168
just brought so much
love and happiness to me.

1080
01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:43.591
So. we get on the horses...

1081
01:05:43.635 --> 01:05:47.465
The first thing she's like.
"This is how slow we travel?"

1082
01:05:47.552 --> 01:05:49.206
I'm so tired.

1083
01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:51.599
It's so hot.

1084
01:05:51.643 --> 01:05:55.560
And I'm here because of you.

1085
01:05:55.603 --> 01:05:58.432
So. my mom thought I was
galloping through the Americas.

1086
01:05:58.476 --> 01:06:01.392
How long has it been?

1087
01:06:01.435 --> 01:06:02.959
Four hours?

1088
01:06:03.002 --> 01:06:06.223
It's been like two hours.

1089
01:06:06.266 --> 01:06:08.138
She's like. "Filipe.
I need to get off this horse."

1090
01:06:08.225 --> 01:06:11.054
I'm like. "No. you can't get off
now or we're not gonna make it."

1091
01:06:11.097 --> 01:06:12.925
I push her through
the last few kilometres;

1092
01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:16.059
She just like melts on the ground dying.

1093
01:06:16.102 --> 01:06:17.756
I'm like. "Hey. that's
only the first day.

1094
01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:20.063
- "We got a week to go."
- Sorry. Filipe.

1095
01:06:20.106 --> 01:06:22.413
That's it for me.

1096
01:06:22.456 --> 01:06:23.762
One day.

1097
01:07:13.290 --> 01:07:15.292
My horses had personalities

1098
01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:17.685
that were larger than life.

1099
01:07:17.729 --> 01:07:19.992
Dude was a little surfer dude;

1100
01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.516
He looked like
a California beach bum.

1101
01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.303
bleach-blonde mane.

1102
01:07:26.346 --> 01:07:29.567
But he was also
the police of the horses.

1103
01:07:29.654 --> 01:07:31.656
When I'd put them out
in a pasture with other animals.

1104
01:07:31.699 --> 01:07:33.484
he would kinda stand apart.

1105
01:07:33.527 --> 01:07:35.834
Frenchie and Bruiser
would be glued to each other.

1106
01:07:35.877 --> 01:07:37.879
and Dude would be just
off in the distance.

1107
01:07:37.923 --> 01:07:41.492
and he would not let anyone
get near Frenchie and Bruiser.

1108
01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.678
So. the horses
were just grazing.

1109
01:07:53.721 --> 01:07:56.333
and Dude fell in a big hole.

1110
01:07:56.376 --> 01:07:58.378
Got his leg caught.
cut himself really bad.

1111
01:07:58.422 --> 01:08:01.686
I was getting him out;
It took me like half an hour

1112
01:08:01.729 --> 01:08:03.731
to get him out; I thought
he was gonna break his leg.

1113
01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:05.690
He was struggling so much.

1114
01:08:13.915 --> 01:08:16.440
Dude fell into
this old cattle guard.

1115
01:08:16.527 --> 01:08:20.400
He was pulling back so much he
got his front hoof caught in it.

1116
01:08:20.444 --> 01:08:23.229
and he was pulling back
so hard to try to get it out

1117
01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:26.406
that I thought he was just gonna
break his leg clean off.

1118
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:28.756
And I'm trying to calm him down.
trying to calm him down.

1119
01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.717
and all of a sudden. he just
got up and I got up with him.

1120
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.546
I didn't know if he had broken something.

1121
01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:36.895
And I thought to myself.

1122
01:08:36.938 --> 01:08:39.550
"Please. there has to be
some sort of higher power

1123
01:08:39.593 --> 01:08:41.117
"that can help us."

1124
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.163
Sure enough. the universe sent
me these two kids on a bike

1125
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.599
that had been fishing.

1126
01:08:45.643 --> 01:08:48.385
In 30 minutes. we're loading
the horse up on the truck.

1127
01:08:48.428 --> 01:08:50.300
and we were able to take care of him

1128
01:08:50.387 --> 01:08:52.780
and bring him back to health.

1129
01:08:52.824 --> 01:08:54.782
Tschiffely. Manche. Gato.

1130
01:08:54.826 --> 01:08:57.611
I definitely prayed
to them in the tough moments.

1131
01:08:57.655 --> 01:09:00.223
They were this greater being
that followed me throughout

1132
01:09:00.266 --> 01:09:04.140
the entire experience.
and they changed my life.

1133
01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:05.315
That's all I can say.

1134
01:09:05.402 --> 01:09:06.577
Like. that book "Tschiffely's Ride"

1135
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:11.234
changed my life.

1136
01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:19.764
Emma's come back
to ride with me.

1137
01:09:19.807 --> 01:09:21.244
and it's gonna be an awesome time.

1138
01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:23.594
I'm so excited to have her out here.

1139
01:09:23.637 --> 01:09:25.944
How are we doing?
We're doing good.

1140
01:09:25.987 --> 01:09:28.294
Tired. sweaty...

1141
01:09:28.338 --> 01:09:31.036
but still alive!

1142
01:09:31.123 --> 01:09:32.951
We were riding by monkeys

1143
01:09:32.994 --> 01:09:34.648
hopping from tree to tree.

1144
01:09:34.692 --> 01:09:35.997
Exotic birds.

1145
01:09:37.999 --> 01:09:40.437
We're so close
to the Pacific Ocean.

1146
01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.656
First time these horses
will ever see it...

1147
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.963
it's right there.

1148
01:09:48.619 --> 01:09:50.490
There we go. first time these guys

1149
01:09:50.534 --> 01:09:52.623
walk on the Pacific Ocean.
Frenchie got a little scared.

1150
01:09:53.885 --> 01:09:55.713
Huge moment right now.
huge moment for us.

1151
01:10:16.821 --> 01:10:20.303
Alright. just arriving
at the border with Panama.

1152
01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:22.740
Took the bus just to
make sure I know exactly

1153
01:10:22.827 --> 01:10:24.916
what I need to cross the border because

1154
01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:27.179
I don't wanna be
stuck here for six hours.

1155
01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:30.051
Gonna go check it out now
and then ride the horses here

1156
01:10:30.095 --> 01:10:32.880
hopefully in one or two days.

1157
01:10:32.924 --> 01:10:35.100
When I used to read
"Tschiffely's Ride."

1158
01:10:35.187 --> 01:10:38.408
Panama was always huge because
when he was coming north.

1159
01:10:38.495 --> 01:10:40.671
he had to load his horses on a boat.

1160
01:10:40.714 --> 01:10:44.501
to cross from Colombia into Panama.

1161
01:10:44.544 --> 01:10:48.505
Found the office.
and thank God I came early

1162
01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:50.202
because they have no idea
what to do right now.

1163
01:10:55.076 --> 01:10:57.122
When I got there.
there was this guy.

1164
01:10:57.209 --> 01:10:59.342
spitting out rice as he told me

1165
01:10:59.385 --> 01:11:01.257
what I couldn't do and what I could do

1166
01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.041
and showing me these papers

1167
01:11:03.084 --> 01:11:04.695
and telling me
to look at the website.

1168
01:11:04.738 --> 01:11:07.872
and not being very helpful at all.

1169
01:11:07.915 --> 01:11:11.354
They want to
charge me $250 per horse.

1170
01:11:11.397 --> 01:11:12.703
It's a joke.

1171
01:11:12.746 --> 01:11:14.748
I waited all day for
the vet here yesterday.

1172
01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:16.533
He never showed up.

1173
01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:19.275
They're gonna have to stay here
in quarantine at the border

1174
01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:22.539
for seven days. and that's gonna
mean we're gonna spend Christmas

1175
01:11:22.582 --> 01:11:26.238
right here at the border.
under this tree.

1176
01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:29.067
It's gonna be the worst
Christmas of my life.

1177
01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.419
I was running around everywhere.

1178
01:11:33.463 --> 01:11:36.161
I had to pay $300;
Then I had to pay $100.

1179
01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:37.771
Then I had to run and get a green form;

1180
01:11:37.815 --> 01:11:40.252
Then I had to get a yellow form;
Then I had to get this form.

1181
01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.646
What I found out is that
in order to import a horse

1182
01:11:42.733 --> 01:11:46.258
into Panama. that animal had
to spend six months or longer

1183
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.956
in the country from where
you're exporting it from.

1184
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.784
It was like someone pulled
the ground from underneath me.

1185
01:11:50.828 --> 01:11:53.396
It's like.
"What am I gonna do?"

1186
01:11:53.439 --> 01:11:57.095
Now I just got a new price.
and it is...

1187
01:11:57.138 --> 01:11:58.923
$12.000.

1188
01:11:58.966 --> 01:12:00.577
I absolutely hate borders.

1189
01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:02.013
I hate bureaucracy.

1190
01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.363
I hate stupid rules and regulations

1191
01:12:04.450 --> 01:12:05.669
that mean nothing.

1192
01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:07.410
At first we were gonna go to Colombia.

1193
01:12:07.453 --> 01:12:09.760
Then all of a sudden.
the ministry of agriculture

1194
01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:12.589
in Brazil notifies me that there is a virus

1195
01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:15.156
and if the horses touch foot
in Colombia or Venezuela.

1196
01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.115
they now can't enter Brazil.

1197
01:12:17.158 --> 01:12:19.596
The horses are not leaving Costa Rica.

1198
01:12:19.639 --> 01:12:20.945
Again.

1199
01:12:20.988 --> 01:12:22.773
We've been stuck for three months now.

1200
01:12:22.816 --> 01:12:24.775
and I really thought that
today was gonna be the day.

1201
01:12:24.818 --> 01:12:26.342
but it's not.

1202
01:12:27.865 --> 01:12:30.781
So we gotta keep trying. I guess.

1203
01:12:30.824 --> 01:12:32.826
For the first time I was like.

1204
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:37.178
"Is the trip over?"

1205
01:12:37.222 --> 01:12:41.313
A horse has never been sent
from Costa Rica to Peru.

1206
01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:43.968
Boats don't take horses anymore
in this part of the world.

1207
01:12:44.011 --> 01:12:46.623
So we have
to talk to the president

1208
01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:48.799
of the ministry
of agriculture in Brazil

1209
01:12:48.842 --> 01:12:51.976
to call the president of the
ministry of agriculture in Peru

1210
01:12:52.019 --> 01:12:55.806
to open up a window for the first time.

1211
01:12:55.849 --> 01:12:59.853
Every border I got to
wanted to make me quit.

1212
01:12:59.897 --> 01:13:04.684
Fuck!

1213
01:13:04.728 --> 01:13:07.208
It's just so hard to...

1214
01:13:07.252 --> 01:13:11.212
to have to think about
leaving my horses here.

1215
01:13:11.256 --> 01:13:14.738
They've worked so hard to...

1216
01:13:14.825 --> 01:13:17.523
...to get us this far.
you know. and...

1217
01:13:20.439 --> 01:13:23.268
The amount of like cocaine
and marijuana that cross

1218
01:13:23.355 --> 01:13:26.706
these borders every day...

1219
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:29.187
The amount of illegal things
that go on every day.

1220
01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:30.536
I've seen it.

1221
01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:33.104
I've travelled through
the little. little paths

1222
01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:34.932
beside the border where drugs are cross.

1223
01:13:35.019 --> 01:13:36.760
where women are crossed illegally.

1224
01:13:36.847 --> 01:13:40.198
where whatever you want you can get.

1225
01:13:40.241 --> 01:13:43.375
And everyone turns a blind eye
and officials are paid off

1226
01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.203
and politicians steal more money.

1227
01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:46.770
but when you're
trying to do something right.

1228
01:13:46.857 --> 01:13:48.380
you get all your tests done.

1229
01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:53.559
you hire the vet. you pay
$16.000 to do something right.

1230
01:13:53.603 --> 01:13:56.867
you know. you have everything
you need. they just. like...

1231
01:14:02.742 --> 01:14:06.746
Border guards
are. by nature. hostile.

1232
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:11.098
They are an extenuation of
the ancient Roman prejudice

1233
01:14:11.142 --> 01:14:16.234
that anyone mounted
was an uncivilized barbarian.

1234
01:14:16.277 --> 01:14:20.151
And Filipe's journey
across the international borders

1235
01:14:20.238 --> 01:14:24.721
as he went south became
increasingly hard. hostile.

1236
01:14:24.764 --> 01:14:28.072
and dangerous.
because the bureaucrats

1237
01:14:28.115 --> 01:14:30.509
that were in charge of the borders

1238
01:14:30.596 --> 01:14:33.773
were intent on keeping him out.

1239
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:40.476
Alright. so it's just
after 10 o'clock in the morning.

1240
01:14:40.519 --> 01:14:42.434
it's 10:13.

1241
01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:46.569
and I have a message from
the authorities of Brazil.

1242
01:14:46.612 --> 01:14:49.659
Please. baby Jesus.
please God. please universe.

1243
01:14:49.746 --> 01:14:52.183
make it be good news.

1244
01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:55.969
Woo!
Aah!

1245
01:14:56.013 --> 01:14:57.362
We got it. we got it!

1246
01:14:57.449 --> 01:15:00.452
Fuck!
Yeah!

1247
01:15:03.977 --> 01:15:06.371
Woo!

1248
01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:14.118
Oh...

1249
01:15:17.164 --> 01:15:20.777
Thank you.

1250
01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.387
We finally
managed to get the horses

1251
01:15:22.474 --> 01:15:24.302
on an Avianca flight to Peru.

1252
01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:26.173
Alright. boys. you ready to fly?

1253
01:15:26.217 --> 01:15:31.135
You ready to fly?

1254
01:15:31.178 --> 01:15:34.530
No problem. eh. Frenchie?

1255
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:48.239
I love you guys!

1256
01:16:02.035 --> 01:16:03.820
Hey!

1257
01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:08.912
What's up?

1258
01:16:08.999 --> 01:16:10.609
Oh!

1259
01:16:13.525 --> 01:16:15.701
So. after
a few days of quarantine.

1260
01:16:15.745 --> 01:16:17.268
they finally let us leave

1261
01:16:17.355 --> 01:16:19.705
and we were able to ride through Peru.

1262
01:16:22.273 --> 01:16:24.841
After one year
eight months on the road.

1263
01:16:24.884 --> 01:16:27.844
we are officially in Peru.

1264
01:16:27.887 --> 01:16:29.541
In South America.

1265
01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:33.893
I can't even begin to express
how amazing it feels.

1266
01:16:33.937 --> 01:16:37.070
Riding in Peru!

1267
01:16:41.248 --> 01:16:44.382
Currently on the coast in Lima.

1268
01:16:44.425 --> 01:16:46.689
Have to get
to the Bolivian border.

1269
01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:50.867
and then somehow to the Brazilian border.

1270
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:53.391
It's nice that we at least
get to enjoy this

1271
01:16:53.434 --> 01:16:55.436
and the horses are
resting in a nice ranch.

1272
01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:59.440
so everyone is recharging before
the final stretch to Brazil.

1273
01:17:09.059 --> 01:17:10.408
Not so good.

1274
01:17:10.451 --> 01:17:13.106
Bumpy ride.

1275
01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:15.761
Unfortunately.
Frenchie. Bruiser. and Dude

1276
01:17:15.805 --> 01:17:20.679
only had a certain number of
days to transit through Peru.

1277
01:17:20.766 --> 01:17:22.333
We ended up having to trailer them

1278
01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.988
all the way
to the Bolivian border.

1279
01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:46.313
So. after another
mountain of paperwork

1280
01:17:46.357 --> 01:17:48.620
and South American bureaucracy.

1281
01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.710
we finally made it to
La Paz with the horses

1282
01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:54.278
and were able to continue our ride.

1283
01:18:02.503 --> 01:18:05.637
Can't believe it.
Just outside of La Paz.

1284
01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:08.814
It's been an insane road
to get here.

1285
01:18:08.858 --> 01:18:11.469
but somehow. some way.

1286
01:18:11.512 --> 01:18:14.777
we managed to get to
the last country we'll cross.

1287
01:18:25.526 --> 01:18:27.572
From the Andes.
we rode southeast

1288
01:18:27.659 --> 01:18:29.879
to the Brazilian
border town of Corumbá.

1289
01:18:29.966 --> 01:18:34.492
Mato Grosso do Sul.

1290
01:18:34.535 --> 01:18:36.537
Today is one of the most important days

1291
01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:38.496
of the entire trip.

1292
01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:41.412
After one year and 11 months
on the road.

1293
01:18:41.499 --> 01:18:43.719
we finally get to Brazil.

1294
01:19:01.867 --> 01:19:03.695
Adios. Bolivia!

1295
01:19:12.399 --> 01:19:14.880
Stepping on Brazilian soil.

1296
01:19:14.924 --> 01:19:17.535
so many emotions.

1297
01:19:17.578 --> 01:19:19.842
I can't believe it. we're here.

1298
01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:22.888
More than 14.000 kilometres
away from Calgary.

1299
01:19:22.932 --> 01:19:26.283
and we're here in Brazil.

1300
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:28.720
My parents drove up.

1301
01:19:28.764 --> 01:19:31.070
Before my dad even stopped his truck.

1302
01:19:31.114 --> 01:19:32.942
my little sister runs out

1303
01:19:33.029 --> 01:19:35.553
and gives me the biggest hug ever.

1304
01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:38.643
It was almost three years
that I hadn't seen her.

1305
01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:41.559
It was a big moment of deja vu.
because in the hard moments.

1306
01:19:41.602 --> 01:19:44.301
when the bullets were flying.
when the horses were hurt.

1307
01:19:44.388 --> 01:19:49.219
I would take myself to my
parents' embrace and to Brazil.

1308
01:19:49.262 --> 01:19:51.221
And I think that's kind of
why I got there as well.

1309
01:19:51.264 --> 01:19:54.093
because I was able to visualize it so much

1310
01:19:54.137 --> 01:19:57.923
that one day it just happened.

1311
01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:25.777
I spent three months
riding through Brazil.

1312
01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.431
getting stopped on the road...

1313
01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:29.259
Like. I could barely ride

1314
01:20:29.302 --> 01:20:31.957
because it meant so much
for the Brazilian people.

1315
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.527
We just came to
a really small. small.

1316
01:20:36.614 --> 01:20:38.355
little pueblo here in Brazil.

1317
01:20:38.442 --> 01:20:42.098
and Alex just gave me this
to scare the jaguars away.

1318
01:20:52.673 --> 01:20:55.502
I will never forget
the way my country

1319
01:20:55.546 --> 01:20:58.854
welcomed me back home.

1320
01:21:13.999 --> 01:21:18.134
I'm very blessed
to have amazing parents.

1321
01:21:18.177 --> 01:21:22.181
They never cut my wings.

1322
01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:43.246
Where those flags
are on the horizon...

1323
01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:46.989
that's Barretos.
that's the rodeo grounds.

1324
01:21:47.032 --> 01:21:48.338
It's like a mirage!

1325
01:21:48.381 --> 01:21:50.775
I can't believe we're here!

1326
01:21:50.862 --> 01:21:54.170
A-ha!

1327
01:21:54.213 --> 01:21:57.521
Oh. thank you!

1328
01:21:57.564 --> 01:22:00.567
Ah!

1329
01:22:03.527 --> 01:22:05.094
Oh. man!

1330
01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:07.357
I can't believe we made it!

1331
01:22:17.715 --> 01:22:20.892
It was dark outside.

1332
01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:24.200
There was a helicopter
hovering over us.

1333
01:22:24.243 --> 01:22:27.246
Frenchie obviously
did not like the helicopter.

1334
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:29.596
And I was just so nervous.

1335
01:22:33.426 --> 01:22:35.428
We get to the back of the arena.

1336
01:22:35.472 --> 01:22:37.909
and then this guy just goes...

1337
01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:42.609
"Filipe Leite.
the horseman of the Americas!"

1338
01:22:55.622 --> 01:22:56.928
Being a long rider.

1339
01:22:56.972 --> 01:23:01.237
it's someone that has
a deep passion for horses.

1340
01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.978
that loves nature
and wants to be connected

1341
01:23:03.021 --> 01:23:06.068
to the natural world.

1342
01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:11.856
It's someone that wants to
understand humanity at its core.

1343
01:23:11.943 --> 01:23:14.511
It's someone that doesn't
ride a horse for competition.

1344
01:23:14.598 --> 01:23:18.123
to win prizes or ribbons or money.

1345
01:23:20.778 --> 01:23:24.260
I love those horses so much. you know?

1346
01:23:24.303 --> 01:23:28.481
My kids. Frenchie.
Bruiser. and Dude...

1347
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:35.880
...we just became so close
on this journey.

1348
01:23:35.967 --> 01:23:37.534
And they were just like my kids.

1349
01:23:37.621 --> 01:23:39.492
Like. that's
the only way to explain.

1350
01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:42.626
We went through so much.

1351
01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:45.063
and to be there with them.

1352
01:23:45.150 --> 01:23:47.065
after everything we had been through.

1353
01:23:47.152 --> 01:23:50.721
and for them to be so healthy...

1354
01:23:50.808 --> 01:23:53.463
I'll never forget that.

1355
01:23:57.467 --> 01:23:59.469
I got up to the stage.

1356
01:23:59.512 --> 01:24:02.341
My mom was there with my dad.

1357
01:24:02.385 --> 01:24:04.561
The people that had been important to me.

1358
01:24:04.648 --> 01:24:06.563
and I felt so alive at that moment.

1359
01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:12.003
and I just thanked
everyone that helped me.

1360
01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:14.005
And then they took me to go see my statue.

1361
01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:16.007
I'm like. "What?"

1362
01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:18.183
Oh my God!

1363
01:24:18.227 --> 01:24:21.012
I don't deserve this.

1364
01:24:21.056 --> 01:24:26.061
Oh my God!

1365
01:24:26.104 --> 01:24:27.758
No. this is...

1366
01:24:27.845 --> 01:24:30.021
I'm 27 years old.

1367
01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:32.328
and I'm looking up at Bruiser's head

1368
01:24:32.371 --> 01:24:36.245
and then me on top.
more than five metres tall.

1369
01:24:36.332 --> 01:24:39.204
Oh my God. this is insane.

1370
01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.773
...in their own unique ways.

1371
01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:45.036
Our next guest's journey to Brazil

1372
01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.777
is nothing short of amazing.

1373
01:24:46.864 --> 01:24:48.953
Filipe and Bruiser!

1374
01:24:52.217 --> 01:24:54.176
We're
incredibly impressed by you

1375
01:24:54.219 --> 01:24:55.612
and what you've
been able to accomplish.

1376
01:24:55.699 --> 01:24:57.527
but how about giving the horse some credit?

1377
01:24:58.876 --> 01:25:00.878
Exactly. exactly!

1378
01:25:00.921 --> 01:25:03.402
This is Bruiser.
one of the three heroes

1379
01:25:03.446 --> 01:25:07.189
that walked 8.000 miles
from Canada to Brazil.

1380
01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:08.581
It's insane.

1381
01:25:08.625 --> 01:25:10.105
They're warriors.

1382
01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:41.092
Going up that mountain.
it was like they knew.

1383
01:25:43.834 --> 01:25:48.665
My dad built them a house.
built them stalls. and...

1384
01:25:48.752 --> 01:25:51.233
I promised him when I met
them. I said. "Listen boys.

1385
01:25:51.276 --> 01:25:53.800
"we're gonna go to war here.
but we're gonna make it.

1386
01:25:53.844 --> 01:25:55.802
"and I'm gonna give you guys
the best retirement

1387
01:25:55.846 --> 01:25:59.937
"a horse could ever ask for."

1388
01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:03.636
I walked them out to the pasture.

1389
01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:08.119
Little Dude...

1390
01:26:10.034 --> 01:26:12.602
My little mustang.

1391
01:26:12.645 --> 01:26:15.692
And now you're free to be
a little mustang again.

1392
01:26:15.779 --> 01:26:17.694
Eh?
Good job.

1393
01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:19.130
I love you so much. buddy.

1394
01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:21.219
Thank you so much.

1395
01:26:21.306 --> 01:26:22.481
You're the best horse in the world.

1396
01:26:22.525 --> 01:26:24.701
I know you know that.

1397
01:26:24.788 --> 01:26:27.182
And I wouldn't have
gotten here without you.

1398
01:26:27.225 --> 01:26:32.535
Frenchie. I know we got
off to a rocky beginning.

1399
01:26:32.622 --> 01:26:35.625
You almost killed me.

1400
01:26:35.668 --> 01:26:36.974
But I wouldn't have done this without you.

1401
01:26:37.017 --> 01:26:39.194
with all your spirit. all your heart.

1402
01:26:39.237 --> 01:26:41.979
And I love you so much.

1403
01:26:42.022 --> 01:26:44.199
Thank you.

1404
01:26:44.242 --> 01:26:47.289
Thank you. thank you. thank you. thank you.

1405
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:53.295
And I still had Naomi's ashes.

1406
01:26:53.338 --> 01:26:57.168
She went the entire way from
Craig. Colorado. to Brazil.

1407
01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:59.257
There were so many moments
where I thought I was gonna die

1408
01:26:59.344 --> 01:27:01.738
or the horses were gonna die.
and somehow. some way.

1409
01:27:01.825 --> 01:27:04.349
we came out the other side alive.

1410
01:27:04.393 --> 01:27:06.699
I really started to believe
that this woman was there

1411
01:27:06.743 --> 01:27:08.223
to protect us.

1412
01:27:08.266 --> 01:27:10.486
She was my guardian angel.

1413
01:27:14.359 --> 01:27:17.014
I asked her to continue
to watch out for the horses

1414
01:27:17.057 --> 01:27:20.844
and keep them safe.

1415
01:27:25.544 --> 01:27:28.895
And that's when my life fell apart.

1416
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:35.337
You've spent 803 days
chasing kilometres with horses.

1417
01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:38.557
and then all of a sudden.
you're back to your house.

1418
01:27:38.601 --> 01:27:40.733
you're back to real life.

1419
01:27:40.777 --> 01:27:44.259
you're cut off from the herd.

1420
01:27:44.302 --> 01:27:46.913
I had symptoms of PTSD.

1421
01:27:46.957 --> 01:27:49.220
I started experiencing
anxiety and depression.

1422
01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:51.918
couldn't sleep at night.
recurring nightmares.

1423
01:27:54.965 --> 01:27:58.708
Emma broke up with me.

1424
01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:02.233
In this mess that I was in.
like a lot of people.

1425
01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:04.366
I turned to the bottle
and started drinking.

1426
01:28:04.409 --> 01:28:07.717
And one night I made the
mistake of getting in my truck.

1427
01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.067
and nearly died.

1428
01:28:19.424 --> 01:28:21.296
For 6.000 years.

1429
01:28:21.339 --> 01:28:24.734
brave men and women have
been swinging into the saddle

1430
01:28:24.777 --> 01:28:28.912
and setting off in search
of adventure and freedom.

1431
01:28:28.955 --> 01:28:31.915
Sadly. in the last 50 years.

1432
01:28:31.958 --> 01:28:37.573
the world has turned into
a mediocrity by travel machines.

1433
01:28:37.616 --> 01:28:42.099
Filipe represents the end
of the age of Tschiffely.

1434
01:31:58.382 --> 01:31:59.644
Filipe's journey

1435
01:31:59.688 --> 01:32:03.343
provides us with the message of hope.

1436
01:32:03.387 --> 01:32:05.955
Yes. we have hostile borders.

1437
01:32:05.998 --> 01:32:11.308
but what we see in Filipe is a beacon.

1438
01:32:11.351 --> 01:32:14.790
He had the courage to
overcome discouragement.

1439
01:32:14.833 --> 01:32:17.967
He then confronted and overcame

1440
01:32:18.010 --> 01:32:21.623
every kind of obstacle
the Americas could throw at him.

1441
01:32:21.666 --> 01:32:25.975
And what he proves is that the
mounted argonauts of the past

1442
01:32:26.018 --> 01:32:31.023
are still with us.

1443
01:32:31.067 --> 01:32:35.593
The horse ultimately has
made me a better human being.

1444
01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:39.336
The horse is one of the biggest
mammals. yet it's so calm.

1445
01:32:39.379 --> 01:32:42.208
And there are studies
that prove that that energy.

1446
01:32:42.252 --> 01:32:43.645
it transcends to people

1447
01:32:43.688 --> 01:32:45.864
that spend a lot of time around horses.

1448
01:32:45.908 --> 01:32:48.171
You end up being a calmer being.

1449
01:32:48.214 --> 01:32:51.609
And horses today help people
with mental problems;

1450
01:32:51.696 --> 01:32:53.524
They help people with addiction.

1451
01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:55.091
I am an example of what the horse can do.

1452
01:32:55.178 --> 01:32:57.528
The horse pulled me out of a depression.

1453
01:32:57.572 --> 01:33:00.662
The horse was my therapy.

1454
01:33:00.705 --> 01:33:03.926
In 2019. I started
the final portion of my ride

1455
01:33:04.013 --> 01:33:07.886
from Alaska to Calgary
on two wild horses.

1456
01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:12.848
with Clara by my side.

1457
01:33:17.417 --> 01:33:18.636
When I started the journey.

1458
01:33:18.723 --> 01:33:20.377
I was leaving Canada

1459
01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:25.208
and returning to what I thought
was my home. Brazil.

1460
01:33:25.251 --> 01:33:27.863
The fact of the matter is
that when I arrived in Brazil.

1461
01:33:27.906 --> 01:33:31.562
I realized I couldn't be further from home.

1462
01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:35.697
And today. when you ask me
what home signifies to me.

1463
01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:39.570
it has a name.
and it's "Clara."

1464
01:33:52.757 --> 01:33:55.107
You know. very few
people will get to spend

1465
01:33:55.151 --> 01:33:57.762
as much time as I did with the same horses.

1466
01:33:57.806 --> 01:34:01.244
and out of all of the lessons
I learned from them.

1467
01:34:01.287 --> 01:34:04.900
I think the most important
one was the simplest:

1468
01:34:04.943 --> 01:34:08.294
Take that first step.
