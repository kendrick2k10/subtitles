00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:55.208
<i>I. Constance Reid.</i>
<i>take you. Clifford Chatterley.</i>

4
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.208
<i>to be my lawfully wedded husband.</i>

5
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.750
<i>to have and to hold from this day forward.</i>

6
00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.041
<i>for better and for worse.</i>

7
00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:06.291
<i>for richer and for poorer.</i>

8
00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:08.708
<i>in sickness and in health.</i>

9
00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.833
-How does it feel?

10
00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.666
-I don't know. Ask me tomorrow.

11
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.875
-You need to eat something.
-I need to get out of this dress.

12
00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:31.916
Ooh.

13
00:01:32.416 --> 00:01:33.250
Mmm.

14
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.291
How do I look?

15
00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:38.166
Well. I doubt Clifford
will want to stay long at the reception.

16
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.916
You don't think
his mother would've approved?

17
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.708
Well. I'm not entirely sure I do.

18
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.250
Are we talking about the dress now. Hilda.

19
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.083
-or the wedding?

20
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:51.458
He goes back to the front in the morning.
Imagine if we'd left it.

21
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:53.416
and then something terrible happened.

22
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.958
-Couldn't you have just had sex with him?
-Hilda! Be serious.

23
00:01:57.041 --> 00:02:01.583
I am. It's much less commitment.
and it's all Clifford will want anyway.

24
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:02.958
Clifford's not like that.

25
00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:06.000
You know him. He's kind and thoughtful.

26
00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:07.250
He makes me feel safe.

27
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:10.291
His family's more traditional than ours.
I suppose.

28
00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:13.375
but I think his own views
are actually quite progressive.

29
00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:14.625
-Really?
-Yes.

30
00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:15.541
Hmm…

31
00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:20.166
-Does he know about that German boy?
-Yes. And he says it doesn't matter.

32
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.625
It was before the war.
so it doesn't count.

33
00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:26.416
You don't need to convince me.
I had my own German boy. remember?

34
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.625
Well. mine's dead.

35
00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.791
-You see. that's just it.

36
00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:33.750
-What?

37
00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:35.791
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

38
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.416
You. uh… You open your

39
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:41.291
heart so easily.

40
00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:42.250
Oh. Hilda!

41
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.333
-Clifford!
-Hmm. reinforcements have arrived.

42
00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.625
You read my mind.

43
00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:49.083
I nearly drank yours
on the way up.

44
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.708
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

45
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:51.625
Well. what now?

46
00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:54.250
Our fathers
are preparing their toasts.

47
00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:55.791
Can we face them together?

48
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:57.666
Of course.

49
00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:00.041
You look stunning. Con.

50
00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:02.666
Thanks.

51
00:03:04.791 --> 00:03:07.416
-I can hear them.
-Yeah.

52
00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:09.166
Oh…

53
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:11.875
Are you ready?

54
00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:19.458
-So. here's to Clifford and Connie…

55
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:23.250
…our new hope for an heir to Wragby.

56
00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:25.125
To Clifford and Connie.

57
00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:27.166
Father. that's not just why we married.

58
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.458
No. why else would a baronet get married?

59
00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:31.208
-Shh.

60
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:34.083
-I married because I found Connie.
-And I you.

61
00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:40.416
We would like to thank those
who donated their butter and sugar rations

62
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.041
to help us celebrate.

63
00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:44.250
To the next heir of Chatterley.

64
00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:46.833
-To the Chatterleys!

65
00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:56.250
We'll just watch and wait.

66
00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:11.958
Oh yeah.

67
00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:18.791
Oh God.

68
00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:20.750
"Why else is a baronet ever married?"

69
00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:22.666
Unbelievable.

70
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.583
Do you want children. Clifford?

71
00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:26.833
Uh. yeah. Yeah. someday.

72
00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:30.250
-For our sake. not for my father's.
-Hmm.

73
00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:32.166
Assuming you would.

74
00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:33.875
I think so. yes.

75
00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.333
What? You all right?

76
00:04:53.416 --> 00:04:55.666
Yes. um. of course. Sorry. Uh…

77
00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:57.708
It's just. um…

78
00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:02.375
I can't stop thinking
about going back to the front.

79
00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:04.625
-I… I know I'll be all right.
-You will be.

80
00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:07.833
-We don't have to do anything.
-No. no. I… I want to.

81
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:23.541
Sure you don't want me
to come to the station?

82
00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:24.916
Thanks.

83
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.541
Let's not make a ceremony of it. shall we?

84
00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:38.083
I love you. Con.

85
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:44.125
Bye.

86
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:49.500
I look forward to your letters.

87
00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:52.750
I'll write to you every day.

88
00:06:21.208 --> 00:06:24.583
<i>Dearest Hilda.</i>
<i>I knew the war would change us all.</i>

89
00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:26.958
<i>but I just wasn't sure how much.</i>

90
00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:32.208
<i>It feels as though</i>
<i>it ended half a lifetime ago.</i>

91
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:33.416
<i>not just half a year.</i>

92
00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.833
<i>We've already moved away from London.</i>

93
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.666
<i>We've just arrived at Wragby.</i>

94
00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:41.625
<i>Clifford's family estate.</i>

95
00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:46.125
<i>Once we're settled in.</i>
<i>I expect to write to you often.</i>

96
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:48.958
<i>Your loving sister. Connie.</i>

97
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.541
Thank you.

98
00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:04.291
Welcome home. Sir Clifford.
We've been praying for you.

99
00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:08.083
Thank you. Mr. Warren.

100
00:07:10.583 --> 00:07:11.458
There's the one

101
00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:13.333
All right.

102
00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:18.375
Thank you. I can. uh… I can manage.

103
00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:22.833
Mr. and Mrs. Warren. this is my wife.

104
00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:25.291
the new Lady Chatterley.

105
00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:27.083
It's so nice to meet you. milady.

106
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.125
There's plenty of work to be done.

107
00:07:32.708 --> 00:07:35.083
Hire back all the workers
we can. Mrs. Warren.

108
00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.625
Old girl's seen better days.

109
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:39.833
We'll bring her back to life.

110
00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.500
We thought you might like to use
your father's study as the master bedroom.

111
00:07:44.583 --> 00:07:46.416
so you don't have to bother
with the stairs.

112
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.208
Thank you. Mrs. Warren.

113
00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:50.458
No.

114
00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:53.375
No. let's put the luggage in here.

115
00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:56.583
We'll use the library as a master.

116
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:00.833
-Wow.

117
00:08:02.416 --> 00:08:05.833
What is more inspiring
for a writer than to sleep among books?

118
00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:13.291
This is where they found Father.
They say his heart gave out.

119
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.583
I think he died of chagrin.

120
00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:19.458
Clifford… it's all done now.

121
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.750
Life is what we make of it.

122
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:25.625
-Mrs. Warren.
-Yes.

123
00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:27.791
Let's open the curtains.
let some light in.

124
00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:29.166
Of course. milady.

125
00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:33.750
-We should have a look around.
-I will.

126
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.708
You're welcome to use
the private room above the library

127
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:39.166
with the family portraits.

128
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.125
You can have
the whole of the second floor.

129
00:08:43.791 --> 00:08:44.958
Welcome home. Clifford.

130
00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:25.916
You all right? I've got you.
Lean on me. put your weight on me.

131
00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:29.708
-Ready?
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

132
00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:39.916
I'm getting the hang of it.

133
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.333
-Love it.
-Mmm.

134
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:46.333
You know. um…

135
00:09:47.291 --> 00:09:50.416
I'm thinking of expanding
the short story I wrote in Cambridge.

136
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.208
-Hmm?
-Turning it into a novel.

137
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:54.000
-It's a wonderful idea.
-You think?

138
00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:55.208
Mm-hmm.

139
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:57.625
-You'll be my editor?
-Of course.

140
00:09:57.708 --> 00:10:00.125
Proofreader. typist.
I'll submit my application.

141
00:10:00.208 --> 00:10:02.041
I'll get you to the top of the pile.

142
00:10:03.125 --> 00:10:04.125
-All right?
-Yes.

143
00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:07.833
-Ooh. this bed is softer than I thought.

144
00:10:12.208 --> 00:10:14.916
-First night at Wragby. Hmm.
-Welcome.

145
00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:18.791
-Oh. sorry.
-Oh. you're fine. Really.

146
00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:55.708
What?

147
00:10:58.291 --> 00:10:59.125
I'm sorry. Con.

148
00:11:01.541 --> 00:11:03.250
I just can't anymore. you know?

149
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.416
I'm so sorry.

150
00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.583
It's all right. Don't worry.

151
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.416
You'll be fine?

152
00:11:12.916 --> 00:11:13.750
Yes.

153
00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:28.500
I love you. Con.

154
00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:32.125
This is misfortune. but you'll see.

155
00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:34.916
We… We'll be happy here

156
00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:36.875
at Wragby.

157
00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:43.583
Hello. sir.

158
00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:46.916
I'm a strong. hardworking man.
and I will not let you down.

159
00:11:47.958 --> 00:11:50.541
Lily Wheedon.
My mum worked for Sir Geoffrey.

160
00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:53.000
Really?

161
00:11:54.416 --> 00:11:55.333
Oliver Mellors?

162
00:11:56.583 --> 00:11:59.083
You. uh. worked for my father
before the war.

163
00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:00.666
Aye. sir.

164
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.041
-And you were an army lieutenant.
-I was. sir.

165
00:12:04.125 --> 00:12:06.708
Do you honestly believe
that a return to gamekeeping

166
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.416
will be satisfying
after your time as an officer?

167
00:12:10.291 --> 00:12:11.833
Bit of quiet'd do me good.

168
00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:16.291
-I've seen enough of what war does to men.
-Hmm.

169
00:12:16.375 --> 00:12:17.666
As have I.

170
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.291
You must know your way
around the estate better than I do.

171
00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:23.583
Oh. no. milady.
I couldn't visit while she was working.

172
00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:26.916
Very well then. Welcome back. Mr. Mellors.

173
00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:28.583
Sir.

174
00:12:28.666 --> 00:12:32.041
In that case. we'll have to
learn our way around together. Won't we?

175
00:12:32.125 --> 00:12:33.916
-Hmm.
-Thank you. Lily.

176
00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:36.750
My name is Kelly Martin. milady.

177
00:12:36.833 --> 00:12:39.041
-Thank you.
-I've been a maid for five years.

178
00:12:43.166 --> 00:12:44.208
<i>Dear Hilda.</i>

179
00:12:45.291 --> 00:12:47.583
<i>I'm a thoughtless lout</i>
<i>for not writing sooner.</i>

180
00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:52.083
<i>In my defense. Wragby needed</i>
<i>an enormous amount of tending to.</i>

181
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:54.916
<i>But we finally have a full staff</i>

182
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.125
<i>who've done wonders</i>
<i>in restoring the place.</i>

183
00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:04.000
<i>Clifford's strength has returned.</i>

184
00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:08.750
<i>I'm still the only one</i>
<i>he's willing to let help him.</i>

185
00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:11.333
<i>but every day.</i>
<i>he can do more and more on his own.</i>

186
00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:17.708
<i>He's writing. all the time.</i>

187
00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:22.291
<i>which keeps his spirits up.</i>
<i>and he's nearly finished his first novel.</i>

188
00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:26.500
"I first met Mrs. Gertrude
at a dinner. comma.

189
00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:28.875
-thrown by Lord Witherby."

190
00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.750
Witherby. W-I-T-H-E-R-B-Y.

191
00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:35.416
"With the sort of fellow. whom--"
I'm quite pleased with this…

192
00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.166
-"The sort of fellow…"
-<i>It is quiet here in the country.</i>

193
00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:43.041
<i>I miss the life we had in London.</i>

194
00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:44.708
<i>and. of course. I miss you.</i>

195
00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:48.625
<i>But we have to live. I suppose.</i>

196
00:13:48.708 --> 00:13:50.583
<i>no matter how many skies have fallen.</i>

197
00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:54.250
<i>We have had some guests.</i>

198
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.708
<i>Mostly Clifford's old bachelor friends.</i>

199
00:13:57.291 --> 00:14:00.916
<i>It's hardly surprising that most of them</i>
<i>haven't found women. believe me.</i>

200
00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.916
<i>Now and again.</i>
<i>we also get visits from writers</i>

201
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.875
<i>whose advice Clifford has sought out.</i>

202
00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:07.875
<i>Apparently. my old friends</i>

203
00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:10.208
<i>all seem to think</i>
<i>misfortune is contagious.</i>

204
00:14:22.666 --> 00:14:23.625
<i>I know you and Owen</i>

205
00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:26.208
<i>have been traveling everywhere</i>
<i>since the war ended.</i>

206
00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:30.166
<i>but once you've settled back home.</i>
<i>I would so love to see you.</i>

207
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.958
-Am I interrupting?
-No. not at all.

208
00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:41.083
I was thinking
about going to London for a few days

209
00:14:41.666 --> 00:14:43.125
to visit Hilda.

210
00:14:43.208 --> 00:14:44.958
Leaving me to fend for myself?

211
00:14:45.041 --> 00:14:47.375
We do have
a house full of servants.

212
00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:49.250
I don't need servants. I need you.

213
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.458
Why don't you invite Hilda?
She'd be more than welcome.

214
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:56.791
I have. She can't get away
from London for a few weeks.

215
00:14:56.875 --> 00:14:59.250
Hmm. I'm glad at least she can come.

216
00:15:03.791 --> 00:15:05.166
I'm going to go for a walk.

217
00:15:06.041 --> 00:15:09.583
Why? We can send Mrs. Warren
out for anything you might need.

218
00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:13.625
I don't need anything. Clifford.
I just want to go for a walk.

219
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.833
Very well. dear.

220
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.333
-As you like.
-Jesus.

221
00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:53.708
-Hello.

222
00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:55.750
Flossie! Come here. lass.

223
00:16:06.916 --> 00:16:07.791
Come on.

224
00:16:08.416 --> 00:16:10.250
Good girl. Good girl.

225
00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:19.583
I wandered further down and I found this
stream running right through the woods.

226
00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:25.041
I. uh. think I know the place.
Doubt I'd be able to get there anymore.

227
00:16:25.125 --> 00:16:27.458
I'm sure we can find a way
if you wanted to go.

228
00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:29.666
-Right.
-Perhaps.

229
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.083
Here we are.

230
00:16:32.166 --> 00:16:33.291
-Ready?
-Yes.

231
00:16:35.208 --> 00:16:36.041
All right.

232
00:16:36.666 --> 00:16:38.458
It's fine.

233
00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:40.958
-It's all right?
-Yes.

234
00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:42.750
Uh. I don't want you to drop me.

235
00:16:42.833 --> 00:16:44.166
I'm not going to drop you.

236
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:45.666
Look. just. um…

237
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:46.750
There we go.

238
00:16:46.833 --> 00:16:49.458
There we are. That's fine.
Just let me go there.

239
00:16:51.458 --> 00:16:53.041
Thank you. Thank you.

240
00:16:59.875 --> 00:17:01.541
Ah. There.

241
00:17:01.625 --> 00:17:04.875
-See. you didn't need my help at all.

242
00:17:09.208 --> 00:17:11.958
-There must be times you hate me for this.
-No.

243
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:14.125
I wouldn't blame you.

244
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.291
There are days
I wish I hadn't made it back.

245
00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:20.875
Clifford.

246
00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:22.916
Don't talk like that.

247
00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:28.541
I'd be lost without you. Con.
You know that.

248
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.583
Let's open some windows.
get some fresh air in here.

249
00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:43.625
I've never seen the sky so clear.

250
00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:47.166
Yes. well. there's no smoke in the air.
Mines are closed for May Day.

251
00:17:48.541 --> 00:17:50.208
You should go down to Tevershall.

252
00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:52.916
See the fair. You can. you know?

253
00:17:54.291 --> 00:17:55.750
Just be back in time for tea.

254
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.708
-Yes. I might.
-Hmm.

255
00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:15.791
-Nice to see you. Lady Chatterley.
-Milady.

256
00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:25.333
It's nice to meet you. Lady Chatterley.

257
00:18:25.416 --> 00:18:27.000
Oh. that's so kind.

258
00:18:27.083 --> 00:18:28.041
Thank you.

259
00:18:39.291 --> 00:18:40.958
Happy May Day to you. milady.

260
00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:42.125
Happy May Day.

261
00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:44.083
Who's this? She's precious.

262
00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:46.041
-This is my Josephine.
-Hi. Josephine.

263
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.958
Say hello to Lady Chatterley.

264
00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:51.250
I seem to be having
that effect on people today.

265
00:18:52.583 --> 00:18:55.958
I'm Mrs. Flint.
I'm a schoolteacher here in the village.

266
00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:57.666
I'm Connie. Lovely to meet you.

267
00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:01.458
My. uh… My husband
leases Marehay Farm from your estate.

268
00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:04.333
-Marehay Farm?
-It's not far from where you are.

269
00:19:06.875 --> 00:19:08.958
Side by side we fight forever.

270
00:19:09.041 --> 00:19:11.166
More in numbers makes them stop.

271
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.958
Just as long as we stand together.

272
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.416
What was that?

273
00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:26.583
The miners.
They're out protesting again.

274
00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:29.333
-Again?
-Leave him!

275
00:19:29.416 --> 00:19:32.041
Um. that. um… That happens a lot?

276
00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:34.458
They must've been
from one of the other mines.

277
00:19:34.541 --> 00:19:37.708
They'd lose their jobs if they marched
like that through their own village.

278
00:19:38.291 --> 00:19:42.125
Does it mean our miners from Tevershall
protest in other villages?

279
00:19:43.541 --> 00:19:44.458
I wouldn't know.

280
00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:46.125
I may teach their children.

281
00:19:46.208 --> 00:19:48.916
but I'm an outsider
when it comes to the miners' wives.

282
00:19:49.916 --> 00:19:51.416
That makes two of us.

283
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.750
-Well. hello. Lady Chatterley.
-Hello.

284
00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.875
You should come
to Marehay one day.

285
00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:58.958
-We'd love to have you.
-I'd love that.

286
00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.166
Thank you.

287
00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:08.666
Where are we going?

288
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.458
You've always wanted me
to join you on one of your walks.

289
00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:13.708
I thought of somewhere
I'd like to show you.

290
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:19.458
-Don't think your chair was made for this.

291
00:20:20.916 --> 00:20:24.958
Ah. Mellors. Give us a hand
trying to get this chair started again.

292
00:20:25.041 --> 00:20:25.958
Yes. sir.

293
00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:30.583
Uh. Connie. have you met Mellors.
our new gamekeeper?

294
00:20:32.958 --> 00:20:34.125
Get down. you. Floss.

295
00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:36.208
She's just being friendly.

296
00:20:37.958 --> 00:20:38.833
Now. then.

297
00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:41.541
You've been at Wragby
sometime. Mr. Mellors?

298
00:20:41.625 --> 00:20:43.916
I was raised here. Your Ladyship.

299
00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:46.291
-Whoa.

300
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.083
Need some help?

301
00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:55.708
Mellors is quite capable
of pushing on his own. There we are.

302
00:20:58.916 --> 00:21:00.791
-Now… Now. now.

303
00:21:01.291 --> 00:21:02.541
Ooh. Ah.

304
00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:03.875
Nothing else. sir?

305
00:21:03.958 --> 00:21:05.375
Nothing else. Good day.

306
00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:09.750
That was kind of you.
Hope it wasn't too heavy.

307
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.583
No. not heavy.

308
00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:13.666
Good day to you. Your Ladyship.

309
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.250
I used to come here as a lad.
sit for hours.

310
00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:30.541
One of the finest views
in all the Midlands.

311
00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:32.833
I want to restore these woods.

312
00:21:32.916 --> 00:21:36.000
If these places aren't preserved.
there'll be no England left.

313
00:21:36.083 --> 00:21:39.333
Our way of life will end.
never mind what we gave up to defend it.

314
00:21:42.166 --> 00:21:45.416
I mind not being able to have a son here
more than any other place.

315
00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:49.291
I'm sorry we can't have one.

316
00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:52.708
Almost be a good thing
if you had a son by another man.

317
00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:56.458
You're not serious?

318
00:21:56.541 --> 00:21:58.750
-Why not?
-Why not? Because…

319
00:21:59.625 --> 00:22:01.291
Because we're married.

320
00:22:01.375 --> 00:22:02.583
I married you. Clifford.

321
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.666
Why would you even suggest such a thing?

322
00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:08.291
You've told me
how much you'd love a child.

323
00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:11.708
This way. you could have one
to dote on. to fill your days.

324
00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:15.833
As far as anyone else knows. I might
still be capable of fathering a child.

325
00:22:15.916 --> 00:22:18.208
If we raised him here at Wragby.
he'd be ours.

326
00:22:21.208 --> 00:22:22.458
Do you really mean this?

327
00:22:23.916 --> 00:22:27.791
Well. of course. I wouldn't want you
to yield yourself completely to him.

328
00:22:27.875 --> 00:22:31.833
but the mechanical act of sex is nothing
when compared to a life lived together.

329
00:22:32.416 --> 00:22:34.166
If you govern your emotions accordingly.

330
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:36.916
we could arrange this
like a trip to the dentist.

331
00:22:38.291 --> 00:22:39.875
A trip to the…

332
00:22:44.666 --> 00:22:47.250
And you wouldn't mind
what man's child I had?

333
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.750
I trust your judgment. You wouldn't let
the wrong sort of fellow touch you.

334
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.625
Someone of the utmost discretion.
The Chatterley name depends on it.

335
00:22:58.791 --> 00:23:01.208
Would you expect me
to tell you who this man was?

336
00:23:02.291 --> 00:23:03.208
Best I don't know.

337
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.666
An heir really means this much to you?

338
00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:12.083
It means a lot to the people here.

339
00:23:14.791 --> 00:23:17.458
I know you can do it for them
and for the Chatterleys.

340
00:23:19.833 --> 00:23:21.416
You do agree with me. don't you?

341
00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:45.875
I'm going ahead.

342
00:23:46.666 --> 00:23:47.583
Okay.

343
00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:08.791
They're all talking about your book
in London. It's good work.

344
00:24:08.875 --> 00:24:10.083
You really think so?

345
00:24:10.166 --> 00:24:12.000
I wanted to write something special.

346
00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:15.333
Not just popular.
but something really first class.

347
00:24:15.416 --> 00:24:18.708
The entire pals collective
across the entire northeast.

348
00:24:18.791 --> 00:24:21.750
keeping them together.
making sure they've got all of--

349
00:24:21.833 --> 00:24:24.333
So sorry. Will you excuse me?
Just for a second?

350
00:24:24.416 --> 00:24:25.750
Uh. yes. Um…

351
00:24:25.833 --> 00:24:28.083
-Thank you. Thank you. sir.

352
00:24:32.583 --> 00:24:35.208
You imagine they've solved
the world's problems yet?

353
00:24:35.291 --> 00:24:37.375
I'm sure they think they have.

354
00:24:37.458 --> 00:24:40.041
Shame they've forgotten
their solutions by daybreak.

355
00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:42.416
You're a writer.
Maybe you should take notes.

356
00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.916
I doubt I'd be welcome
in that drinking circle.

357
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.500
Don't worry. I'm not really
a part of this world. either.

358
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.208
-Oh. but you grew up in it. didn't you?
-Hardly. My father's an artist.

359
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.458
So I grew up between rented villas

360
00:24:55.541 --> 00:24:58.625
and woke up each morning
to the smell of turpentine.

361
00:24:58.708 --> 00:25:00.791
Sounds like quite the Bohemian lifestyle.

362
00:25:01.458 --> 00:25:05.416
There must be days
when you don't feel like a lady at all.

363
00:25:06.375 --> 00:25:10.333
I head back home in the morning.
With luck. he'd invite me to visit again.

364
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.208
That's the last time
we'll invite the Irish playwright.

365
00:25:18.458 --> 00:25:19.791
-Michaelis?
-Hmm.

366
00:25:21.125 --> 00:25:23.083
He writes well. he knows how to dress.

367
00:25:23.833 --> 00:25:26.208
but he's got the manners
of a Dublin street rat.

368
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:34.000
Maybe because he knows he's only around
as long as people deem him useful.

369
00:25:35.416 --> 00:25:36.791
We all know where we stand.

370
00:25:39.583 --> 00:25:41.958
You ought to eat something.
You're wasting away.

371
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:46.083
-I'm not feeling well.
-Hmm? Mmm.

372
00:25:46.166 --> 00:25:48.666
I haven't been feeling well
since our conversation.

373
00:25:50.625 --> 00:25:51.458
Clifford.

374
00:25:53.125 --> 00:25:54.791
Here we are. look!

375
00:25:54.875 --> 00:25:56.625
I got my picture in the paper.

376
00:25:58.125 --> 00:26:01.375
Hmm. Chatterley's novella
has garnered attention

377
00:26:01.458 --> 00:26:04.250
for its humorous analysis
of people and their motives.

378
00:26:04.916 --> 00:26:08.791
though his views on modern society
are not young and playful.

379
00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:11.666
but curiously old
and obscenely conceited."

380
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:14.916
-Clifford. stop reading.
-"A wonderful display of nothingness."

381
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.291
It's just one review.

382
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.583
But they're right.

383
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.458
They… they've seen right through me.

384
00:26:22.583 --> 00:26:23.791
It's all nothing.

385
00:26:24.375 --> 00:26:28.791
A home. love.
sex. marriage. friendship. all of it.

386
00:26:29.875 --> 00:26:30.875
You don't mean that.

387
00:26:31.583 --> 00:26:32.500
I think I do.

388
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.708
I do. The whole point of living

389
00:26:35.791 --> 00:26:38.416
is learning to accept
the great nothingness of life.

390
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.750
I'm going to get dressed.

391
00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:45.458
-Connie. Connie. it's me.

392
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:47.791
Oh my God. you came.

393
00:27:47.875 --> 00:27:49.208
-What's wrong?
-I…

394
00:27:51.208 --> 00:27:52.833
-What's wrong?

395
00:27:54.833 --> 00:27:55.916
Tell me what's wrong.

396
00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.291
-What on earth are you doing?

397
00:28:01.458 --> 00:28:02.375
What's this?

398
00:28:03.041 --> 00:28:05.750
I just… I wanted a change and…

399
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:10.625
You're ill.

400
00:28:10.708 --> 00:28:13.333
-No. I'm fine.
-Has no one been looking after you?

401
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.583
Um. they have.

402
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.375
I'm so tired of them watching me. Hilda.

403
00:28:21.208 --> 00:28:22.708
It's inescapable. It's…

404
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.375
I'm so tired.

405
00:28:25.833 --> 00:28:27.083
It's okay.

406
00:28:31.666 --> 00:28:32.625
Thank you.

407
00:28:45.583 --> 00:28:47.083
Connie's not well. Clifford.

408
00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:48.208
You think?

409
00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:51.041
She's exhausted.
Look how thin she's gotten.

410
00:28:51.125 --> 00:28:54.125
I'm afraid
it doesn't suit her to be a half-virgin.

411
00:28:55.083 --> 00:28:57.625
This chair
doesn't very much suit me either. Hilda.

412
00:28:57.708 --> 00:29:00.791
What do you propose?
Find her another of your German soldiers?

413
00:29:00.875 --> 00:29:04.833
She needs to see a doctor.
Do you have one you. uh. use around here?

414
00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:05.875
I'll look into it.

415
00:29:06.458 --> 00:29:08.916
No. I'll take her to a doctor we trust.

416
00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:11.041
In the meantime.

417
00:29:11.541 --> 00:29:14.083
you must hire someone
to take care of you personally.

418
00:29:14.166 --> 00:29:17.916
-I'm doing perfectly well. thank you.
-I'm not worried about you. Clifford.

419
00:29:19.041 --> 00:29:21.833
Who's taking care of her
while she's taking care of you?

420
00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:24.791
-Connie and I will discuss it.
-Connie and I already have.

421
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.458
-I believe you know this woman.

422
00:29:28.541 --> 00:29:31.833
Mrs. Bolton.
She cared for you when you were young.

423
00:29:33.833 --> 00:29:35.958
Connie won't be your caregiver any longer.

424
00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:39.958
We're so grateful
that you could come. Really.

425
00:29:40.583 --> 00:29:42.541
It must be hard for Sir Clifford.

426
00:29:42.625 --> 00:29:45.041
all he's suffered.
and hard on you as well.

427
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.000
You think your know how life will be.
and suddenly it's gone.

428
00:29:49.083 --> 00:29:53.125
I only had my Ted for three years
before he was killed in mines.

429
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:54.833
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

430
00:29:54.916 --> 00:29:56.083
Never you mind.

431
00:29:56.166 --> 00:30:00.375
Now. you just follow doctor's orders
and leave the care of Sir Clifford to me.

432
00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:02.583
Ah. Clifford. This is Mrs. Bolton.

433
00:30:04.625 --> 00:30:05.916
I remember Mrs. Bolton.

434
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.250
-Are we all satisfied?
-For the time being.

435
00:30:10.083 --> 00:30:13.416
I'm headed back to London.
and Connie's going for a nice long walk.

436
00:30:14.041 --> 00:30:15.583
Good. Safe travels.

437
00:30:16.166 --> 00:30:18.583
Connie. would you stop in
at the gamekeeper?

438
00:30:18.666 --> 00:30:20.833
Ask if the new pheasants
have begun laying?

439
00:30:21.416 --> 00:30:22.333
Of course.

440
00:31:39.916 --> 00:31:40.916
Lady Chatterley.

441
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:45.125
-Does Sir Clifford need help?
-No. He sent me.

442
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.833
-Sorry. I don't mean to intrude.
-No.

443
00:31:51.083 --> 00:31:52.250
Do you want to come in?

444
00:31:57.416 --> 00:32:01.000
-Sorry. I'm not dressed for company.
-No. Not to worry.

445
00:32:01.583 --> 00:32:02.708
I just wanted. um…

446
00:32:02.791 --> 00:32:06.041
Sir Clifford wanted to know
if the new pheasants had begun laying.

447
00:32:06.125 --> 00:32:08.541
Oh. aye. Yes. milady. Yeah.

448
00:32:08.625 --> 00:32:11.500
There'll be plenty of young chicks
in a matter of weeks.

449
00:32:13.625 --> 00:32:16.666
This is a lovely little cottage.
You live alone here?

450
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.000
Quite alone. milady.

451
00:32:21.708 --> 00:32:23.083
You read James Joyce?

452
00:32:23.583 --> 00:32:24.916
That one was hard to find.

453
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.958
Do you read much?

454
00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:29.875
Well. it suits my solitary nature.

455
00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:32.708
Still.

456
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.500
Must be awfully quiet around here.

457
00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:39.125
No. I've got Flossie for company.

458
00:32:39.666 --> 00:32:40.541
Mm-hmm.

459
00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:43.166
Um…

460
00:32:44.208 --> 00:32:47.333
Well. um. I'll let Clifford know

461
00:32:48.166 --> 00:32:49.250
about the pheasants.

462
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:51.708
Um. thank you.

463
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.708
-I'll see you out then.
-All right.

464
00:32:56.291 --> 00:32:57.916
-Apologies.

465
00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:00.041
Lovely flowers.

466
00:33:01.708 --> 00:33:03.416
Take some back with you.

467
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.208
-No. I couldn't.
-Why not?

468
00:33:07.083 --> 00:33:08.166
They're yours.

469
00:33:11.583 --> 00:33:13.291
-You sure?
-Yeah. help yoursen.

470
00:33:22.375 --> 00:33:23.416
Good day. then.

471
00:33:29.458 --> 00:33:32.250
Mrs. Flint. I brought you some flowers.

472
00:33:32.958 --> 00:33:35.541
They're beautiful!
Aren't you thoughtful!

473
00:33:36.583 --> 00:33:39.250
-It's quite all right.
-Let's get you a vase. Sit down.

474
00:33:39.333 --> 00:33:42.875
They're all growing in the fields
by the keeper's cottage. Everywhere.

475
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:46.666
Here. have these.

476
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.166
Ah. Oh.

477
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.833
Interesting fellow. isn't he. the keeper?

478
00:33:52.541 --> 00:33:54.541
He seems gruff at first. but then…

479
00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:59.333
The older teachers still talk about
how clever Oliver Mellors was as a lad.

480
00:33:59.833 --> 00:34:02.416
It's no wonder
he came back home a full lieutenant.

481
00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:05.583
But now he lives down there? Alone?

482
00:34:06.708 --> 00:34:08.541
He was married. Um…

483
00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:12.208
But. uh. his wife. Bertha.

484
00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:15.250
the whole time he was gone.
she carried on with other men.

485
00:34:15.958 --> 00:34:18.000
It was awful. Everyone knew.

486
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.500
So. they're divorced now?

487
00:34:21.708 --> 00:34:23.875
Oh. not properly. I don't think.

488
00:34:23.958 --> 00:34:27.291
Uh. but there never was
much proper about Bertha Coutts.

489
00:34:27.958 --> 00:34:30.916
She's off living
with another man at Stacks Gate.

490
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.166
Ned. I think his name is.

491
00:34:34.125 --> 00:34:37.625
I imagine Mr. Mellors would be happier
never hearing from either again.

492
00:34:40.166 --> 00:34:41.291
This is Wendy.

493
00:34:41.375 --> 00:34:42.375
Hello. Wendy.

494
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:44.708
She's beautiful.

495
00:35:55.291 --> 00:35:57.708
There was
an explosion in the mines.

496
00:35:57.791 --> 00:35:59.666
and Ted was only 28.

497
00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:03.125
The company
said it was his own fault somehow.

498
00:36:03.208 --> 00:36:05.791
He was running away
when he should have laid down.

499
00:36:06.458 --> 00:36:09.291
Though the compensation was only £300.

500
00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:12.041
I'll never forgive them for that.

501
00:36:12.125 --> 00:36:14.166
Them branding Ted a coward.

502
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.750
He wasn't a coward. though. Mrs. Bolton.

503
00:36:18.166 --> 00:36:19.666
He was only trying to survive.

504
00:36:21.666 --> 00:36:23.416
You really should let Lily do that.

505
00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:26.166
You're his nurse. not his servant.

506
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.250
No. I don't mind. Busy hands. quiet mind.

507
00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:36.333
Oh. there's the bell. I have to go.

508
00:37:29.375 --> 00:37:31.083
I wondered what the hammering was.

509
00:37:33.666 --> 00:37:35.791
I'm prepping the coops
for the new chicks.

510
00:37:36.333 --> 00:37:38.791
-Oh.

511
00:37:41.916 --> 00:37:44.250
-Is there a chair in this hut?

512
00:37:47.541 --> 00:37:48.708
Come on in.

513
00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:51.041
Thank you.

514
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.583
I'll light you a fire. milady.

515
00:37:59.083 --> 00:38:01.625
-Oh. No. don't bother.
-No. I insist.

516
00:38:06.375 --> 00:38:08.666
-Warm yourself up a little bit.

517
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.083
-All right?
-Thank you.

518
00:38:58.333 --> 00:39:00.250
I never knew this hut was here before.

519
00:39:02.166 --> 00:39:03.583
Not many do.

520
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.458
It's why I like it.

521
00:39:07.541 --> 00:39:09.541
Do you keep it locked
when you're not around?

522
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.125
Sometimes. milady.

523
00:39:12.208 --> 00:39:13.083
Can I have a key?

524
00:39:14.333 --> 00:39:15.541
You want a key?

525
00:39:16.875 --> 00:39:17.708
Hmm.

526
00:39:17.791 --> 00:39:19.750
I think I'd like to sit here sometimes.

527
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.875
I don't know if there is another key.

528
00:39:30.083 --> 00:39:32.208
Well. I'll see to it myself. then.

529
00:39:48.666 --> 00:39:49.833
Quite the walk you had.

530
00:39:50.583 --> 00:39:51.958
Sorry. Am I late?

531
00:39:52.833 --> 00:39:54.833
Could have asked Mrs. Bolton to make tea.

532
00:39:54.916 --> 00:39:56.875
I don't quite see her
presiding at the tea table.

533
00:39:56.958 --> 00:40:00.583
Hmm. I don't remember
anything about tea in our wedding vows.

534
00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:07.916
Do you know if there's a second key
to the hut where the pheasants are reared?

535
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.500
Uh. yes. There may be one
in the study. Why?

536
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:14.083
I thought it was quite lovely.
Might read my book there.

537
00:40:14.166 --> 00:40:16.000
Books by that degenerate Irishman?

538
00:40:16.583 --> 00:40:18.041
What? James Joyce?

539
00:40:18.125 --> 00:40:20.458
I heard his next
is to be banned for obscenity.

540
00:40:20.541 --> 00:40:23.791
Hmm. such a shame.
I was looking forward to reading it.

541
00:40:29.458 --> 00:40:31.125
-Was Mellors at the hut?
-Mm-hmm.

542
00:40:31.708 --> 00:40:34.375
-He didn't appreciate the intrusion.
-What did he say?

543
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.375
Nothing. It was just his manner.

544
00:40:38.333 --> 00:40:40.541
Don't think he liked me
having freedom of the castle.

545
00:40:40.625 --> 00:40:44.000
Comes with a lieutenant
going back to being gamekeeper.

546
00:40:44.083 --> 00:40:47.500
What do you expect. giving a fellow
like that rank and a sense of importance

547
00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:48.791
then taking it all away?

548
00:40:52.958 --> 00:40:54.041
<i>Dear Hilda.</i>

549
00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:57.458
<i>I hope it hasn't been raining</i>
<i>all week in London.</i>

550
00:40:58.375 --> 00:40:59.291
<i>It has here.</i>

551
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:04.333
<i>Until now. I've been able to go out</i>
<i>and explore the grounds all I liked.</i>

552
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.125
<i>But I've spent</i>
<i>most of this last week cooped up.</i>

553
00:41:08.208 --> 00:41:10.041
<i>aching to get back outside.</i>

554
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.125
<i>I'm writing now from a little hut I found.</i>

555
00:41:15.125 --> 00:41:17.708
<i>A secret place</i>
<i>where I can hide away from the world.</i>

556
00:41:18.791 --> 00:41:20.458
<i>Only one other person comes here.</i>

557
00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:28.625
Don't worry. I was just going.
Only came to get out the rain.

558
00:41:31.041 --> 00:41:31.875
Here.

559
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.375
I shall leave this here
until I get another one.

560
00:42:00.416 --> 00:42:03.625
Look at you.
You must be lord of the manor.

561
00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:13.916
So. it's a simple enough game.

562
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.125
It begins with a 32-card deck
running seven through ace…

563
00:42:39.041 --> 00:42:43.291
…he died last year from a fall.

564
00:42:43.375 --> 00:42:45.375
Eighty-three he was.

565
00:42:45.458 --> 00:42:48.208
-The chicks have started hatching.
-Oh. good.

566
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:50.500
-I got Madrid. Listen to this.

567
00:42:50.583 --> 00:42:52.333
<i>…of evidence of young feds.</i>

568
00:42:52.416 --> 00:42:53.541
What are they saying?

569
00:42:54.125 --> 00:42:55.083
Damn!

570
00:42:56.833 --> 00:42:58.958
-I've lost the signal.
-Oh.

571
00:42:59.875 --> 00:43:01.000
Damn!

572
00:43:01.083 --> 00:43:02.708
Well. the young have…

573
00:43:03.458 --> 00:43:07.625
Most have left Tevershall. they say.
now the coal's running thin.

574
00:43:07.708 --> 00:43:10.458
It won't be long
before the town's finished.

575
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.166
-Finished? Are they really saying that?
-Hmm.

576
00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:19.000
Mrs. Bolton.
will you call down to the mines?

577
00:43:19.083 --> 00:43:23.041
-See that Mr. Linley joins us for dinner.
-Will do. sir. Absolutely.

578
00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:27.916
<i>I wish I could</i>
<i>be with you in Venice.</i>

579
00:43:29.333 --> 00:43:31.791
<i>but Clifford says</i>
<i>he can't manage here without me.</i>

580
00:43:32.458 --> 00:43:33.916
<i>Not yet at least.</i>

581
00:43:34.916 --> 00:43:36.916
<i>But I'll come</i>
<i>on the next holiday. I promise.</i>

582
00:43:38.541 --> 00:43:42.458
<i>With love. your sister Connie.</i>

583
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.458
Well. if it starts
to increase profits.

584
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:50.291
That should keep them in business
for the foreseeable future.

585
00:43:50.375 --> 00:43:53.958
-We can modernize as well. Why not?
-Clifford. what about your writing?

586
00:43:54.458 --> 00:43:56.291
The literary world doesn't need me.

587
00:43:56.375 --> 00:43:59.666
But the mine's a sinking ship.
It needs a proper captain to save her.

588
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:02.333
Don't you think the miners
have led grim enough lives?

589
00:44:02.416 --> 00:44:05.416
I mean. couldn't you just
help them move on?

590
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.583
To what? Begging?

591
00:44:06.666 --> 00:44:10.208
"Help them move on."
You talk like a woman.

592
00:44:10.916 --> 00:44:12.250
Spoken like a man.

593
00:44:12.333 --> 00:44:14.375
Mr. Linley.
how much might it cost us.

594
00:44:14.458 --> 00:44:17.041
a ballpark. to build a chemical work?

595
00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:20.166
Initially.
I'd say around £500 to £700.

596
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.666
Obviously. within that.
there is contingency…

597
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:57.291
Came to see the chicks.

598
00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:04.708
How many do we have now?

599
00:45:04.791 --> 00:45:06.750
-Eighteen.
-Eighteen.

600
00:45:10.875 --> 00:45:12.250
Can I touch one?

601
00:45:12.333 --> 00:45:13.250
Yeah. go on.

602
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:15.916
What if it pecks at me?

603
00:45:16.458 --> 00:45:17.416
Just peck it back.

604
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.500
Ooh.

605
00:45:29.958 --> 00:45:30.958
You just…

606
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.500
-Ah… Oh…
-Uh…

607
00:45:47.625 --> 00:45:49.291
That's it. Gently.

608
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:53.250
-He's trembling.
-You're trembling more than he is.

609
00:46:05.875 --> 00:46:06.916
That's the way.

610
00:46:30.833 --> 00:46:32.458
-Milady?

611
00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:35.208
Here…

612
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:38.916
Shall we get you
sat down in there a minute?

613
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.500
-I'm so sorry.
-It's all right.

614
00:46:44.708 --> 00:46:45.625
Sorry.

615
00:46:56.541 --> 00:46:58.208
So that's how it's been. eh?

616
00:46:59.375 --> 00:47:00.250
Dinna cry.

617
00:47:05.083 --> 00:47:06.708
Let's get you by the fire.

618
00:47:13.958 --> 00:47:16.208
-I want more firewood.
-Okay.

619
00:47:19.166 --> 00:47:20.166
Please don't go.

620
00:50:40.583 --> 00:50:41.666
I'll walk you back.

621
00:50:59.541 --> 00:51:00.750
You all right. milady?

622
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.333
Mm-hmm.

623
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.375
You?

624
00:51:05.833 --> 00:51:06.666
Mm-hmm.

625
00:51:08.125 --> 00:51:09.625
I should probably go on alone.

626
00:51:21.166 --> 00:51:22.250
Goodbye then.

627
00:51:22.333 --> 00:51:24.000
Goodbye. milady.

628
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.708
There you are. milady.
I thought you'd gone lost.

629
00:52:15.791 --> 00:52:17.041
No. I'm absolutely fine.

630
00:52:17.666 --> 00:52:20.708
Why did you lock the door?
I only went to see the new chicks.

631
00:52:20.791 --> 00:52:21.916
Sorry.

632
00:52:23.708 --> 00:52:26.500
Is Clifford upset?
I didn't say goodbye to the guests.

633
00:52:26.583 --> 00:52:29.500
Oh. he hasn't said anything.
He's still in with Mr. Linley.

634
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.666
Oh. so he didn't notice I was gone?

635
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:35.083
-Oh. Milady. you know Sir Clifford.

636
00:52:35.583 --> 00:52:36.500
Night.

637
00:52:41.875 --> 00:52:44.791
No. no. of course. it's uh…
It's very similar…

638
00:52:45.583 --> 00:52:47.750
-Good night. Con.
-Good night.

639
00:53:54.166 --> 00:53:55.500
I've been waiting for you.

640
00:53:57.541 --> 00:54:01.000
Don't you think folks will become
suspicious if you keep coming here?

641
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.666
Imagine how lowered you'd feel.
you with your husband's gamekeeper.

642
00:54:06.791 --> 00:54:07.625
You afraid?

643
00:54:08.458 --> 00:54:09.500
I bloody well am.

644
00:54:10.875 --> 00:54:12.125
I bloody well am. yeah.

645
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:15.708
Not of what people think of me. milady.

646
00:54:17.125 --> 00:54:20.541
But if you were to ever feel sorry
for what we've been--

647
00:54:38.291 --> 00:54:39.291
We have to be quick.

648
00:54:59.583 --> 00:55:00.625
This.

649
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.375
I can't stay long.

650
00:55:25.458 --> 00:55:26.541
Someone will notice.

651
00:55:38.541 --> 00:55:39.625
Look at me.

652
00:56:53.625 --> 00:56:55.166
-Huh?

653
00:56:58.833 --> 00:56:59.708
I need to go.

654
00:57:14.583 --> 00:57:16.541
Do we still feel like strangers to you?

655
00:57:17.666 --> 00:57:18.666
Pardon me?

656
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:21.375
Do we still feel like strangers?

657
00:57:28.791 --> 00:57:30.583
Not like strangers I've ever known.

658
00:57:52.083 --> 00:57:53.541
Come to the cottage tomorrow.

659
00:57:56.625 --> 00:57:57.625
If I can.

660
00:58:00.333 --> 00:58:01.291
Good night.

661
00:58:01.958 --> 00:58:03.583
Good night. then. Your Ladyship.

662
00:58:06.875 --> 00:58:08.125
-Oliver.
-Yes?

663
00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:34.208
If we can
produce that fuel here. then it'll--

664
00:58:36.083 --> 00:58:37.125
Connie?

665
00:58:37.708 --> 00:58:40.750
-Connie… Are you all right?
-Hmm.

666
00:58:40.833 --> 00:58:44.583
-Not feeling unwell again?
-No. not at all. Sorry. You were saying.

667
00:58:44.666 --> 00:58:47.333
I know the mine
seems to be all I speak of these days.

668
00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:50.250
But Tevershall belongs to me.

669
00:58:52.041 --> 00:58:53.750
One day it will belong to an heir.

670
00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:58.583
And the mine needs our help.

671
00:58:59.625 --> 00:59:01.458
We must modernize.

672
00:59:01.958 --> 00:59:03.750
-You and me.

673
00:59:07.083 --> 00:59:08.500
<i>My dear sister…</i>

674
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.500
<i>I've thought a lot about</i>
<i>what you said at the wedding.</i>

675
00:59:13.416 --> 00:59:15.375
<i>That I open my heart too easily.</i>

676
00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:19.625
<i>That may have been true before the war.</i>

677
00:59:20.958 --> 00:59:22.791
<i>but I don't think it is any longer.</i>

678
00:59:24.666 --> 00:59:27.125
<i>Lately. I've felt my heart</i>
<i>opening up again.</i>

679
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:29.791
<i>Despite all warnings.</i>

680
00:59:31.333 --> 00:59:33.125
<i>-And I can assure you…</i>
<i>-Connie.</i>

681
00:59:33.208 --> 00:59:36.166
<i>-…nothing about it has been easy.</i>
-<i>Look at me.</i>

682
00:59:37.708 --> 00:59:38.875
<i> Look at me.</i>

683
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.583
<i>Look at me.</i>

684
00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:53.166
-Lady Chatterley.

685
00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:56.166
-Your book!
-Oh. it's all right. Thank you.

686
01:00:17.791 --> 01:00:19.041
Joggety. joggety. jog.

687
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:21.208
Joggety. joggety. jog.

688
01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:24.208
-She's perfect.
-Don't let her fool you.

689
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:26.791
That one's given us
a lot of sleepless nights.

690
01:00:26.875 --> 01:00:28.000
Bet it's all worth it.

691
01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.958
Well. we're very happy
to have you. aren't we. Josephine?

692
01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:33.458
Aren't we?

693
01:00:33.541 --> 01:00:35.791
Clifford and I talked
about having a child one day.

694
01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:36.916
Have you?

695
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.916
Hmm. I mean. just because
he's lost the use of his legs.

696
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.625
doesn't mean we can't have children.

697
01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:44.541
-That's wonderful. isn't it?

698
01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:47.291
Josephine would love a new playmate.

699
01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:49.708
Would you?

700
01:00:50.208 --> 01:00:53.416
And being a mother.
I recommend it by all means.

701
01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:56.333
I lied to you.

702
01:00:56.416 --> 01:00:57.375
She's perfect.

703
01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:04.541
-What's the gamekeeper doing here?
-He comes each day for fresh milk.

704
01:01:04.625 --> 01:01:06.916
-Good day to you. Mr. Mellors.
-Mrs. Flint.

705
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.041
-Lady Chatterley.

706
01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.041
-Would you. uh. keep an eye on her?
-Of course.

707
01:01:13.625 --> 01:01:17.041
-Josephine. hello.

708
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.125
All right. tinker. What you got?

709
01:01:22.041 --> 01:01:23.875
Said you'd come to the cottage.

710
01:01:23.958 --> 01:01:25.000
I said I'd try.

711
01:01:26.375 --> 01:01:27.791
Will you come later?

712
01:01:37.375 --> 01:01:38.500
What's this?

713
01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:39.583
What's this. then?

714
01:01:40.458 --> 01:01:42.666
-Here you are.
-Ta. Thank you.

715
01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:44.625
-I should go.
-Oh. all right.

716
01:01:44.708 --> 01:01:47.083
-Lovely to see you. Josephine.

717
01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:50.791
-Shall I walk you home?
-No. No. not necessary.

718
01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:52.791
Um… Lovely to see you. Mrs. Flint.

719
01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:54.708
-Do come again.
-I will.

720
01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:02.583
-Thanks again. Take care. Take care.

721
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.500
Say bye. Say bye.

722
01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:06.500
Bye.

723
01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:13.875
Ayup!

724
01:02:16.416 --> 01:02:18.000
Giving me the slip like?

725
01:02:18.083 --> 01:02:19.291
What do you mean?

726
01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:20.291
Pardon?

727
01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:21.708
What do you mean?

728
01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:24.333
Well. you didn't come to the cottage.

729
01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:27.958
And the way
you pulled back from me just then.

730
01:02:28.041 --> 01:02:30.166
Mrs. Flint could have seen. Are you mad?

731
01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:33.791
Come to the cottage. then.

732
01:02:36.625 --> 01:02:37.541
No.

733
01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:40.916
By the time we get there.
it'll be too late.

734
01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:50.375
Come through here.

735
01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.333
Come on.

736
01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:15.166
What? Here?

737
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.916
Aye. milady.

738
01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:19.208
Right here.

739
01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:25.541
-Don't call me that.
-You don't want to be a lady?

740
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:27.166
Not with you.

741
01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:31.916
You would want coarser treatment with me?

742
01:03:32.916 --> 01:03:33.750
Mm-hmm.

743
01:04:00.416 --> 01:04:01.375
Take this off.

744
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.625
Undo my trousers.

745
01:04:34.916 --> 01:04:35.750
Yeah.

746
01:04:40.125 --> 01:04:41.833
-Lie down.
-Hmm?

747
01:04:41.916 --> 01:04:42.750
Lie down.

748
01:04:48.833 --> 01:04:49.708
No.

749
01:04:50.458 --> 01:04:52.250
No. don't turn away. Look at me.

750
01:04:59.583 --> 01:05:00.708
I want you to fuck me.

751
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:03.958
You want me to fuck you?

752
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:05.666
Yes.

753
01:05:44.541 --> 01:05:46.125
Yes. Yes.

754
01:05:46.791 --> 01:05:48.750
-Yes. That's it.

755
01:05:48.833 --> 01:05:50.083
That's it. Connie.

756
01:06:37.833 --> 01:06:38.708
Hmm.

757
01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:44.958
We both came off together that time.

758
01:06:47.375 --> 01:06:49.375
-It's good when that happens.
-Hmm.

759
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:55.708
Some people live their whole lives
and never know that feeling.

760
01:06:56.291 --> 01:06:57.750
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

761
01:07:00.666 --> 01:07:03.083
Is that the-- All right. yeah. Fuck knows.

762
01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:10.625
Fuck.

763
01:07:13.541 --> 01:07:16.083
You're gonna have to help me. Connie.
Here you are.

764
01:07:30.583 --> 01:07:31.750
You know what you have?

765
01:07:35.916 --> 01:07:37.208
Tenderness.

766
01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:42.375
I… I didn't say you were gentle.

767
01:07:43.708 --> 01:07:45.208
I've had enough of gentlemen.

768
01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.708
-They're a different breed.
-How do you mean?

769
01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:51.750
Dead.

770
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:53.916
Dead.

771
01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:59.416
You've got to…
cut them parts of you that feel off.

772
01:08:00.625 --> 01:08:02.708
if you're gonna send men into mines or…

773
01:08:03.625 --> 01:08:04.708
factories or…

774
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.500
into battle.

775
01:08:12.833 --> 01:08:14.750
Either that
or you live with what you've done.

776
01:08:17.416 --> 01:08:20.333
You're not like any man
I've… ever met before.

777
01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:22.041
You're not like any other woman.

778
01:08:22.958 --> 01:08:23.958
How?

779
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:35.125
You are beautiful.

780
01:08:40.083 --> 01:08:44.166
You know. I don't think I… realized
how lonely I've been until now.

781
01:08:46.416 --> 01:08:47.375
Thank you.

782
01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:52.833
You better go.

783
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:41.458
Ten of spades.
Well. I have got you there with the king.

784
01:09:42.541 --> 01:09:45.500
-<i>I. Connie…</i>
-<i>I. Oliver…</i>

785
01:09:45.583 --> 01:09:48.125
<i>-…take you. Oliver…</i>
<i>-…take you. Connie…</i>

786
01:09:48.916 --> 01:09:50.875
<i>-…in strength…</i>
-<i>…and in freedom…</i>

787
01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:53.333
<i>…and in ecstasy.</i>

788
01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:42.708
-How deep is it?

789
01:10:46.458 --> 01:10:47.541
-Please.

790
01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:54.291
-"Why do I like you?"
-Mm-hmm.

791
01:10:55.458 --> 01:10:56.333
"Fruit is black."

792
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:16.458
Hmm.

793
01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.916
Oh. Your Ladyship.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

794
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
-I saw the light and--
-It's all right. honestly.

795
01:11:48.708 --> 01:11:52.458
Sit.
Be happy to have some company.

796
01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:53.416
Really.

797
01:11:55.208 --> 01:11:56.375
Why are you up so late?

798
01:11:56.875 --> 01:11:59.750
Uh. Sir Clifford.
he's not been sleeping.

799
01:11:59.833 --> 01:12:01.416
I can't help looking in on him.

800
01:12:02.916 --> 01:12:05.416
-Hmm.
-It was the same with me husband.

801
01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.291
If he so much as got a cold.
I'd be up all night worrying over him.

802
01:12:09.375 --> 01:12:10.291
Ted.

803
01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:12.708
You must miss him.

804
01:12:12.791 --> 01:12:14.833
Oh. it's been 25 years.

805
01:12:15.416 --> 01:12:18.125
but do you know. still sometimes in bed.

806
01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:21.875
I'll wake up. and I think.
"He's not in bed with me."

807
01:12:23.291 --> 01:12:25.458
Oh. it's just the touch of him.

808
01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:28.375
Aye.

809
01:12:29.916 --> 01:12:31.083
It's amazing. isn't it?

810
01:12:31.833 --> 01:12:33.791
How someone can get so into your blood.

811
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.291
Oh. it is.

812
01:12:36.791 --> 01:12:38.083
It can make you bitter.

813
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:41.916
If it hadn't been for that pit.
Ted'd still be here.

814
01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.875
He hated it down there.

815
01:12:44.958 --> 01:12:48.291
He hated it. but what could he do?
He was trapped.

816
01:12:51.083 --> 01:12:53.083
I suppose we all are in different ways.

817
01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:56.541
You never wanted to remarry?

818
01:12:56.625 --> 01:12:58.166
-Oh. Lord.

819
01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.208
Ted was the only one?

820
01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:01.625
He was.

821
01:13:02.666 --> 01:13:05.625
But you and your man.
you know. you grow together.

822
01:13:06.666 --> 01:13:08.583
Who else is there in life?

823
01:13:08.666 --> 01:13:11.625
Children. of course. but… Oh.

824
01:13:11.708 --> 01:13:13.875
-I'm sorry. that was thoughtless of me.
-No.

825
01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:15.916
Don't worry. It's fine.

826
01:13:17.291 --> 01:13:18.250
Um…

827
01:13:19.041 --> 01:13:20.416
More than fine. actually.

828
01:13:21.375 --> 01:13:23.625
There still might
be some hope in that regard.

829
01:13:24.125 --> 01:13:26.083
-For you and Sir Clifford?
-Hmm.

830
01:13:26.833 --> 01:13:29.000
Doctor says his recovery is remarkable.

831
01:13:29.083 --> 01:13:30.041
So who knows?

832
01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:31.875
I might have a child yet.

833
01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:39.916
Well. I hope and pray that you do.

834
01:13:42.791 --> 01:13:44.416
Can I get you a blanket?

835
01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.166
No. I'm fine. thank you.

836
01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:49.916
Sleep well. Save some secrets
for our next conversation.

837
01:13:51.375 --> 01:13:52.291
Good night.

838
01:14:05.083 --> 01:14:07.458
Come on now. you lass.

839
01:14:09.375 --> 01:14:11.250
I think we're best off outside.

840
01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:22.916
Come on.

841
01:15:07.375 --> 01:15:09.750
-There. there.

842
01:15:50.416 --> 01:15:52.500
Has Her Ladyship not risen yet?

843
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.666
-She got up before I did.
-Hmm.

844
01:15:55.166 --> 01:15:57.083
She's already had her breakfast. then.

845
01:15:57.166 --> 01:15:59.333
Yes. She's out on one of her walks.

846
01:16:00.791 --> 01:16:02.958
I was up early myself.

847
01:16:03.666 --> 01:16:06.666
There were a lot of people out this morn.

848
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:09.750
-The gamekeeper. he was--
-Could you get me some fresh cream?

849
01:16:12.291 --> 01:16:13.500
-Yes. sir.
-Thank you.

850
01:16:14.291 --> 01:16:16.750
-<i>Since Sir Clifford took over.</i>

851
01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:19.291
they've been working
the poor miners to the bone.

852
01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:22.208
I thought the machines
were supposed to make the work easier.

853
01:16:22.291 --> 01:16:24.708
It's a way to make
more money with fewer workers.

854
01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:26.833
Don't he have
enough money already?

855
01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:29.500
Oh. bet his lady
needs her baubles and silk

856
01:16:29.583 --> 01:16:31.583
so she can
lord her station over the rest of us.

857
01:16:31.666 --> 01:16:33.083
No. she's not like that.

858
01:16:33.166 --> 01:16:34.875
She treats folks who work with her

859
01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:37.458
with the same respect
she'd treat a lord or lady.

860
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:39.541
My Lily says the same about her.

861
01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:41.208
Well. she deserves better then.

862
01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:43.166
Such a hard lot that's fallen to her.

863
01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:49.666
Oh! As it happens. uh. Sir Clifford
may not be quite as done in as we thought.

864
01:16:50.541 --> 01:16:54.791
Oh. his legs won't work again.
but. you know. rest might.

865
01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:59.625
Her Ladyship has even suggested
there might be a child one day soon.

866
01:16:59.708 --> 01:17:00.541
What?

867
01:17:00.625 --> 01:17:01.541
-No!

868
01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:04.083
-That's amazing.
-You ever heard of such a thing?

869
01:17:04.166 --> 01:17:06.166
How long
should these things last?

870
01:17:06.250 --> 01:17:09.250
If we keep them
in good repair. for generations.

871
01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:13.583
Speaking of which. sir.
if you don't mind my asking.

872
01:17:13.666 --> 01:17:15.791
is there any truth to the rumor

873
01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:18.291
that we may
still have hope of an heir at Wragby?

874
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:20.166
Are there rumors?

875
01:17:20.916 --> 01:17:21.958
Yes.

876
01:17:22.041 --> 01:17:24.375
Everyone's been asking me
what I know about it.

877
01:17:24.458 --> 01:17:28.041
I am happy to set the record straight
if the rumor's unfounded.

878
01:17:29.041 --> 01:17:29.958
Indeed.

879
01:17:30.916 --> 01:17:31.750
Well…

880
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:35.958
there may yet be hope.

881
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:38.250
Hello. Con.

882
01:17:40.083 --> 01:17:41.125
I've just had

883
01:17:41.208 --> 01:17:43.416
the most interesting meeting
with Mr. Linley.

884
01:17:44.291 --> 01:17:45.125
Hmm?

885
01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:47.458
Have you heard the rumor

886
01:17:48.375 --> 01:17:50.500
that you are to supply Wragby
with an heir?

887
01:17:53.875 --> 01:17:54.875
No.

888
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Is it a joke?

889
01:17:57.916 --> 01:17:59.875
I'd hoped it might be a prophecy.

890
01:18:03.375 --> 01:18:05.000
I received a letter from Father.

891
01:18:05.916 --> 01:18:08.625
He's been invited to Venice
for July and August

892
01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:12.041
and has asked me and Hilda
to come with him.

893
01:18:12.583 --> 01:18:13.583
July and August?

894
01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:17.125
I wouldn't need to go for that long.

895
01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:19.333
Three weeks
should be more than enough time

896
01:18:19.416 --> 01:18:20.541
for what we discussed.

897
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:25.125
Have plans already been set in motion?

898
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:28.666
Not just yet.

899
01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:33.791
If I were absolutely certain
you'd want to come back to me?

900
01:18:35.166 --> 01:18:36.125
Of course I would.

901
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.500
I don't want to know his name.

902
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:42.875
No one can.

903
01:18:51.416 --> 01:18:54.958
Well. in that case. I think
it ought to be all right. don't you?

904
01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:58.291
Mm-hmm.

905
01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:07.666
You know how much
you mean to me. don't you?

906
01:19:09.958 --> 01:19:11.041
And you to me.

907
01:19:12.875 --> 01:19:14.416
I have to go away for a while.

908
01:19:15.416 --> 01:19:16.833
-Where?
-Venice.

909
01:19:18.583 --> 01:19:19.541
With Sir Clifford?

910
01:19:20.708 --> 01:19:22.666
-For how long?
-Just a couple of months.

911
01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:24.125
But no. not with Clifford.

912
01:19:24.208 --> 01:19:26.083
He doesn't like to travel how he is.

913
01:19:26.166 --> 01:19:27.000
Aye.

914
01:19:27.791 --> 01:19:28.916
The poor devil.

915
01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:33.750
-You won't forget about me.
-Forget?

916
01:19:33.833 --> 01:19:35.708
-Mm-hmm.
-You know nobody forgets.

917
01:19:36.958 --> 01:19:38.500
It's not a question of memory.

918
01:19:41.875 --> 01:19:43.000
Look. um…

919
01:19:47.041 --> 01:19:49.791
I told Clifford I might have a child.

920
01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:53.625
You did?

921
01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:59.541
I… I think I'm already… expecting.

922
01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:09.333
Oliver?

923
01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:14.750
What did he say?

924
01:20:17.041 --> 01:20:17.875
Um…

925
01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:19.666
He said he'd be glad

926
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:23.458
as long as the child seemed to be his.

927
01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:27.958
So where does Sir Clifford suppose
that this child is coming from?

928
01:20:28.041 --> 01:20:32.041
-I said I might have an affair in Venice.
-You might. So that's why you're going.

929
01:20:32.125 --> 01:20:34.708
Not to have the affair.
Just the appearance of one.

930
01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:39.375
So that's why you wanted me then.

931
01:20:39.875 --> 01:20:40.958
To get a child.

932
01:20:42.291 --> 01:20:43.791
Of course not. Oliver.

933
01:20:44.666 --> 01:20:47.833
I never planned on you.
I never planned on any of this. really.

934
01:20:47.916 --> 01:20:50.916
What was the plan then. Connie?

935
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.458
What was the plan. really?

936
01:20:53.166 --> 01:20:54.500
-What was the plan?
-I--

937
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.916
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

938
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.416
Well. then. I am damned if I do.

939
01:21:02.416 --> 01:21:03.541
Fucking hell.

940
01:21:04.375 --> 01:21:06.166
Well. it's as Your Ladyship likes.

941
01:21:06.250 --> 01:21:08.666
If you get a child.
Sir Clifford's welcome to it.

942
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:10.208
I shan't have lost anything.

943
01:21:10.291 --> 01:21:12.583
On the contrary.
I've had a nice experience.

944
01:21:12.666 --> 01:21:15.166
-Don't talk like that.
-If you've made use of me.

945
01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:17.583
it's not the first time
I've been made use of. is it?

946
01:21:17.666 --> 01:21:20.083
I don't suppose
it's ever been as pleasant as this time.

947
01:21:20.166 --> 01:21:24.583
Of course. one can't feel
tremendously dignified about it.

948
01:21:25.166 --> 01:21:28.333
I didn't make use of you… Oliver.

949
01:21:28.416 --> 01:21:30.333
As Your Ladyship pleases.

950
01:21:34.083 --> 01:21:35.708
-You forgot your book.

951
01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:37.666
Or have you made use of that as well?

952
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:44.625
With the new generators.
we'll be able to reduce the workforce.

953
01:21:44.708 --> 01:21:47.458
-Striking will be impossible.
-What about the workers?

954
01:21:47.541 --> 01:21:50.083
No man's forced to work for me.
I'm not forced to hire them.

955
01:21:51.958 --> 01:21:54.791
-No wonder the men hate you.
-They don't hate me.

956
01:21:54.875 --> 01:21:57.041
They depend on me.
They should be grateful.

957
01:21:57.125 --> 01:21:59.375
They'd starve
without someone to tend them.

958
01:21:59.458 --> 01:22:01.791
You talk about them
as if they're herd animals.

959
01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:02.833
Not all of them.

960
01:22:02.916 --> 01:22:05.416
An individual
may rise from the pack now and again.

961
01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.000
Most of those men
have been ruled since time began.

962
01:22:08.083 --> 01:22:09.333
And you can rule them?

963
01:22:09.416 --> 01:22:12.125
Yes. because I've been brought up
and trained to do so.

964
01:22:12.208 --> 01:22:14.791
That's my role in society.
as it's their place to serve.

965
01:22:14.875 --> 01:22:18.041
So there is no shared humanity between us?

966
01:22:18.125 --> 01:22:20.708
We all need to eat and breathe.
but beyond that. no.

967
01:22:21.833 --> 01:22:23.500
Shall we go as far as the spring?

968
01:22:24.833 --> 01:22:26.125
Good day to you. Mr. Mellors!

969
01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:27.541
-Ayuh.

970
01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:38.083
Wait. Clifford. I'll push.

971
01:22:38.166 --> 01:22:40.875
What's the use of the thing
if she needs to be pushed?

972
01:22:40.958 --> 01:22:43.625
-You're making it worse!
-Be quiet a moment. will you?

973
01:22:48.916 --> 01:22:49.958
Damn thing!

974
01:22:50.458 --> 01:22:52.083
-Wait. stop!

975
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:55.375
-Mellors.

976
01:22:55.458 --> 01:22:58.875
-Yes. Sir Clifford?
-Know anything about blasted motors?

977
01:22:58.958 --> 01:23:01.500
-I'm afraid not. Has she gone wrong?
-Apparently!

978
01:23:01.583 --> 01:23:03.916
Just have a look
and see that nothing's broken.

979
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:14.916
No.

980
01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:18.000
Seems all right as far as I can see. sir.

981
01:23:18.083 --> 01:23:19.458
Then stand back.

982
01:23:23.208 --> 01:23:25.875
-Maybe if I give it a push.
-No. She'll do it herself.

983
01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:34.333
Yeah?

984
01:23:34.416 --> 01:23:36.583
-You see? Good.

985
01:23:37.125 --> 01:23:38.791
Are you pushing? I asked you not.

986
01:23:38.875 --> 01:23:41.291
-It won't go if I don't.
-Give it a chance. man!

987
01:23:45.416 --> 01:23:46.791
Clifford. watch your brake.

988
01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:51.291
-Right. Fine.
-Clifford!

989
01:23:57.083 --> 01:23:59.125
It's obvious
I'm at everybody's bloody mercy.

990
01:24:00.916 --> 01:24:04.958
It would seem. Mr. Mellors.
that she would need to be pushed.

991
01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:07.541
Do you mind?

992
01:24:07.625 --> 01:24:08.875
-Not at all. sir.
-Hmm.

993
01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:11.750
Right.

994
01:24:11.833 --> 01:24:13.416
-Hang on. hang on.

995
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.541
-Two. three.

996
01:24:16.625 --> 01:24:17.708
Bombs away.

997
01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:20.500
-There we are.

998
01:24:21.875 --> 01:24:24.250
For God's sake. man.
what's the matter with you?

999
01:24:25.291 --> 01:24:29.208
Lungs are a bit knackered. sir.
Little souvenir from the war.

1000
01:24:30.291 --> 01:24:31.916
What the hell are you doing?

1001
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.291
-He needs my help. Clifford!
-God's sake.

1002
01:24:36.041 --> 01:24:36.958
You all right?

1003
01:24:59.125 --> 01:25:02.625
<i>I suppose the other chair</i>
<i>will need a new set of wheels.</i>

1004
01:25:02.708 --> 01:25:04.291
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

1005
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.041
I mean.
how can you treat someone like that?

1006
01:25:07.125 --> 01:25:09.166
Who? The gamekeeper?

1007
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:10.958
He was injured in the war as well.

1008
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:15.541
I mean. if he was in that chair.
what would you have done to him?

1009
01:25:15.625 --> 01:25:18.125
I find your comparison in very bad taste.

1010
01:25:18.208 --> 01:25:21.791
I find your lack of common sympathy
to be in the worst taste imaginable.

1011
01:25:22.583 --> 01:25:24.541
You and your ruling class.

1012
01:25:24.625 --> 01:25:26.625
I thought you were different.
but you're not.

1013
01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:29.625
You make people work
for £2 a week or starve.

1014
01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.541
It's not ruling. Clifford.

1015
01:25:32.625 --> 01:25:33.541
That's bullying.

1016
01:25:48.958 --> 01:25:50.000
Come on in. then.

1017
01:25:55.291 --> 01:25:56.208
I'm sorry.

1018
01:25:57.208 --> 01:25:58.541
I'm sorry for hurting you.

1019
01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:06.000
I don't want you
for the sake of a child… Oliver.

1020
01:26:08.791 --> 01:26:10.041
I just want you.

1021
01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:12.041
All right?

1022
01:26:13.083 --> 01:26:13.916
All right.

1023
01:26:17.916 --> 01:26:22.583
But Clifford has to believe
that I tried to keep us together.

1024
01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:24.666
That this was his idea.

1025
01:26:25.916 --> 01:26:27.416
just all gone terribly wrong.

1026
01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:32.708
For him to give me a divorce.
for us to be together.

1027
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:35.541
he needs to believe that.

1028
01:26:37.291 --> 01:26:38.833
I just want to be with you.

1029
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.708
If that's what you want.

1030
01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:47.666
It's not about wanting. Connie.
You know what I want.

1031
01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:53.166
I've still got to get a divorce
from Bertha meself.

1032
01:26:55.375 --> 01:26:56.708
What happened with Bertha?

1033
01:26:59.166 --> 01:27:01.583
I went off to war.
she carried on with other men.

1034
01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:04.125
And now she refuses to divorce me.

1035
01:27:05.666 --> 01:27:07.875
-What about her other man?
-Ned?

1036
01:27:07.958 --> 01:27:09.791
-Mm-hmm.
-He's a big baby of a fella.

1037
01:27:10.416 --> 01:27:11.458
She bullies him.

1038
01:27:12.125 --> 01:27:15.875
They both drink. he gets sent around here
to harass me for me war pension.

1039
01:27:19.125 --> 01:27:20.833
Aye. let's dinna fight.

1040
01:27:24.416 --> 01:27:25.375
I'm sorry.

1041
01:27:29.041 --> 01:27:31.041
Why don't we just leave them all behind?

1042
01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:34.833
Go to Australia.

1043
01:27:36.333 --> 01:27:37.250
Go somewhere…

1044
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:41.166
Anywhere.

1045
01:27:42.291 --> 01:27:44.250
-The three of us?
-Just our family.

1046
01:27:48.291 --> 01:27:49.583
No one would judge us.

1047
01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:54.583
Seems a wrong and bitter thing
to be bringing a child into this world.

1048
01:27:56.916 --> 01:27:58.416
-You don't mean that.
-I do.

1049
01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.458
-No.
-No. I mean this world here.

1050
01:28:02.083 --> 01:28:03.458
I'm pleased for us.

1051
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.416
I'm pleased for you to be pleased.

1052
01:28:09.375 --> 01:28:12.958
But when I think about around here.
what man has done to man…

1053
01:28:14.833 --> 01:28:17.916
…what leaders of men
have done to their so-called fellow men.

1054
01:28:19.833 --> 01:28:22.166
Reduced them to less than humanness.

1055
01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:25.083
Half corpses
and they think about nowt but money.

1056
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:28.541
Living to make money.

1057
01:28:31.375 --> 01:28:34.375
But not all of us
have the freedom to live life how we want.

1058
01:28:36.625 --> 01:28:38.333
Not all of us can do as we--

1059
01:28:39.916 --> 01:28:40.750
Connie.

1060
01:28:42.625 --> 01:28:43.666
What are you doing?

1061
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.875
Whoo!

1062
01:29:11.083 --> 01:29:12.458
Whoo!

1063
01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:16.333
Come on!

1064
01:29:18.708 --> 01:29:20.916
Whoo!

1065
01:30:17.291 --> 01:30:19.333
Where is she? She's been gone for hours.

1066
01:30:19.416 --> 01:30:22.041
Well. I'm sure
it's just the rain that's keeping her.

1067
01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:24.291
She's… she's probably sheltering
in the hut.

1068
01:30:24.375 --> 01:30:27.583
-I'll send Warren and Betts to find her.
-No. don't you do that.

1069
01:30:27.666 --> 01:30:29.166
It'll only get people talking.

1070
01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:31.750
I'll slip over to the hut
and. uh. see if she's there.

1071
01:30:31.833 --> 01:30:34.791
-What? And leave me here alone?
-Oh. don't you worry.

1072
01:30:35.583 --> 01:30:37.083
We'll be back in no time.

1073
01:30:40.125 --> 01:30:41.500
-Ayup.
-Ayup.

1074
01:30:41.583 --> 01:30:43.791
-Ayup. me duck.
-Ayup. me duck.

1075
01:30:49.208 --> 01:30:50.791
I leave for Venice on Thursday.

1076
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.833
I'll come by the cottage that night.

1077
01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:12.125
Milady?

1078
01:31:18.416 --> 01:31:20.416
Oh. milady. there you are.

1079
01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:24.375
Sir Clifford asked me to look for you.
He was worried something had happened.

1080
01:31:24.458 --> 01:31:27.666
No. No. I was sheltering
in the hut from the rain.

1081
01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:29.333
Mrs. Bolton.

1082
01:31:30.083 --> 01:31:32.500
Your Ladyship would be
quite all right from here.

1083
01:31:33.166 --> 01:31:35.833
Good evening to you.
Good evening to you. Your Ladyship.

1084
01:31:38.958 --> 01:31:42.125
I am not a child.
It's monstrous that I have to be followed.

1085
01:31:42.208 --> 01:31:44.291
My Ladyship. don't say that.

1086
01:31:44.375 --> 01:31:47.250
Sir Clifford was sure
you'd been struck by lightning.

1087
01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:50.541
It's not your fault.
It's foolish of Clifford to worry.

1088
01:31:52.333 --> 01:31:53.875
Well. let's go home now.

1089
01:31:55.791 --> 01:31:57.625
And I'll take care of the rest.

1090
01:32:04.208 --> 01:32:06.458
You don't need
to send the servants out after me.

1091
01:32:06.541 --> 01:32:08.166
God. where have you been?

1092
01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:10.666
You've been gone out hours.
and in a storm like this.

1093
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:12.083
What have you been doing?

1094
01:32:12.166 --> 01:32:15.583
What if I choose not to tell you?
I went to the hut and lit a fire.

1095
01:32:15.666 --> 01:32:20.375
-Look at you. The state of your hair.
-I went out into the rain… naked.

1096
01:32:22.333 --> 01:32:23.708
Are you mad?

1097
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:27.541
Suppose Mellors had seen you
while you were prancing with nothing on.

1098
01:32:27.625 --> 01:32:30.000
Yes… suppose he had.

1099
01:32:31.583 --> 01:32:34.708
You're right. Clifford.
I should really go and get cleaned up.

1100
01:32:37.333 --> 01:32:38.500
Connie!

1101
01:32:57.458 --> 01:32:58.958
My sister's here!

1102
01:33:01.583 --> 01:33:02.500
Hilda.

1103
01:33:02.583 --> 01:33:04.875
-It's so good to see you.
-It's been too long.

1104
01:33:06.875 --> 01:33:08.125
Good to see you.

1105
01:33:09.625 --> 01:33:11.708
You know I've met someone.
don't you?

1106
01:33:13.208 --> 01:33:15.125
I gathered from your letters. yes.

1107
01:33:16.083 --> 01:33:19.208
I tried to tell myself it was nothing.
I tried to stay away. I did.

1108
01:33:19.791 --> 01:33:21.458
But I can't.

1109
01:33:21.541 --> 01:33:22.416
He…

1110
01:33:23.250 --> 01:33:24.375
I really love him.

1111
01:33:25.125 --> 01:33:26.625
-Wow.
-And-- I know.

1112
01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:29.958
And I said I would stay with him tonight.
I promised.

1113
01:33:30.041 --> 01:33:32.166
Are you going to tell me who he is?

1114
01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:33.291
Oliver Mellors.

1115
01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:35.125
He's our gamekeeper.

1116
01:33:38.791 --> 01:33:41.708
No. Hilda. He's lovely.

1117
01:33:42.666 --> 01:33:45.625
Honestly. he has
such an understanding and tenderness.

1118
01:33:45.708 --> 01:33:47.666
He's quite the exception. you'll see.

1119
01:33:49.166 --> 01:33:51.250
I long hoped you would find someone else.

1120
01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:55.041
-But one of Clifford's servants?
-I'm not giving him up!

1121
01:33:55.125 --> 01:33:58.958
Listen to you. It's you
and that German boy all over again.

1122
01:33:59.041 --> 01:34:01.958
-It's not. Hilda! It's nothing like that!
-Yes. it is!

1123
01:34:02.041 --> 01:34:04.916
Confusing sex with love.
and then thinking it can continue

1124
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.625
just because it's what you want.

1125
01:34:07.208 --> 01:34:11.250
Please. come to Venice and take the time
to think through what you really want.

1126
01:34:11.333 --> 01:34:12.916
I know what I want!

1127
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:13.916
-Really?
-Yes!

1128
01:34:15.041 --> 01:34:18.333
And I'm seeing him tonight
or I'm not going to Venice. I can't!

1129
01:34:18.416 --> 01:34:21.583
I really thought that you.
of all people. would understand!

1130
01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:29.500
Goodbye.

1131
01:34:29.583 --> 01:34:31.583
-Bye.
-I look forward to your letters.

1132
01:34:33.833 --> 01:34:36.750
You have a good time.
and then come back and cheer us up.

1133
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:38.458
I will. Take care.

1134
01:34:44.916 --> 01:34:46.083
Oliver.

1135
01:34:46.166 --> 01:34:48.000
This is my sister. Hilda.

1136
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.875
-Hello.
-Hilda. this is Oliver Mellors.

1137
01:34:51.958 --> 01:34:53.458
-Hello.
-Pleasure to meet you.

1138
01:34:55.625 --> 01:34:56.708
Take a seat then.

1139
01:35:07.083 --> 01:35:07.958
Hilda.

1140
01:35:09.125 --> 01:35:10.500
What do you want me to say?

1141
01:35:11.958 --> 01:35:13.541
Whatever it is you're thinking.

1142
01:35:14.625 --> 01:35:15.541
Very well.

1143
01:35:17.125 --> 01:35:19.541
It is one thing
to hold trysts in your cottage.

1144
01:35:20.791 --> 01:35:23.166
but what happens
when you go out into the world?

1145
01:35:24.708 --> 01:35:27.083
When Connie's friends
cross the street to avoid her.

1146
01:35:27.166 --> 01:35:28.208
That's not fair.

1147
01:35:29.083 --> 01:35:31.375
She's got me figured out. then. eh?

1148
01:35:32.708 --> 01:35:35.500
What summed me up so quick?
Were it summat I said?

1149
01:35:36.791 --> 01:35:37.666
Mr. Mellors.

1150
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.375
How do you expect to take care of her
once you've lost your job?

1151
01:35:43.833 --> 01:35:46.958
Do you actually believe
you can give her a chance at happiness?

1152
01:35:47.583 --> 01:35:49.708
Oh. you're asking the wrong person there.

1153
01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:53.083
All I know is I get
a great deal of happiness from her.

1154
01:35:53.166 --> 01:35:56.041
-Thought of your own happiness at least.
-Hilda. enough!

1155
01:35:56.875 --> 01:35:59.208
I think you understand
far better than she does

1156
01:35:59.291 --> 01:36:01.208
how badly this could end. Mr. Mellors.

1157
01:36:03.458 --> 01:36:05.666
Think about how much
she really means to you.

1158
01:36:08.500 --> 01:36:10.833
I'll pick you up
in the morning. Connie. Early.

1159
01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:12.958
Don't keep me waiting.

1160
01:36:13.750 --> 01:36:15.208
-Mr. Mellors.
-Hilda.

1161
01:36:20.833 --> 01:36:23.958
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have brought her.

1162
01:36:28.458 --> 01:36:30.041
Please don't let her upset you.

1163
01:36:31.416 --> 01:36:32.541
She's just protective.

1164
01:36:33.625 --> 01:36:34.916
She's right.

1165
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.416
We haven't thought
beyond tomorrow. have we?

1166
01:36:41.625 --> 01:36:43.708
Sir Clifford will fight this divorce.

1167
01:36:43.791 --> 01:36:45.875
He'll fight to keep our child.

1168
01:37:03.125 --> 01:37:06.125
I never had to think about these things
until you turned up.

1169
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:16.666
Let's go upstairs.

1170
01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:22.916
Yeah. that's good. That's good.

1171
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.250
-Yes.

1172
01:39:19.583 --> 01:39:21.583
The fuck are you playing at. Ned?

1173
01:39:21.666 --> 01:39:25.041
Calm down. Mellors.
I'm not here to fight. Bertha sent me.

1174
01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:26.541
She's your problem now.

1175
01:39:27.125 --> 01:39:27.958
Not mine.

1176
01:39:28.041 --> 01:39:29.250
Ain't how she sees it.

1177
01:39:30.041 --> 01:39:33.333
She's still your wife.
entitled to half your military pension.

1178
01:39:33.416 --> 01:39:36.375
Aye. and I'm entitled to a divorce.
I won't get one. will I?

1179
01:39:38.916 --> 01:39:40.458
-Fuck off. then.

1180
01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:42.750
-All right. I'm going.

1181
01:39:43.875 --> 01:39:44.791
I'm going.

1182
01:39:50.958 --> 01:39:51.875
Is he gone?

1183
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:54.625
Unless his heart's just given out running.

1184
01:39:56.291 --> 01:39:58.000
Stay there till we know he's gone.

1185
01:40:06.666 --> 01:40:09.166
-Oh. what is she thinking?

1186
01:40:11.708 --> 01:40:12.750
Go on.

1187
01:40:33.958 --> 01:40:35.041
Connie.

1188
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:17.458
For heaven's sake. Connie.

1189
01:41:18.041 --> 01:41:21.750
We're going to Venice tomorrow.
Do you have to look so miserable?

1190
01:41:27.541 --> 01:41:28.625
I think I'm pregnant.

1191
01:41:31.291 --> 01:41:32.125
Oh.

1192
01:41:33.541 --> 01:41:34.375
Right.

1193
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.500
I assume it's not Clifford's.

1194
01:41:38.666 --> 01:41:39.500
No.

1195
01:41:41.416 --> 01:41:46.666
Although. he did say he would be happy
for me to have a child with another man.

1196
01:41:47.333 --> 01:41:49.166
-Seriously?
-Mm-hmm.

1197
01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.791
I don't know
how much longer I can do this.

1198
01:41:51.875 --> 01:41:52.750
It's all right.

1199
01:41:52.833 --> 01:41:54.041
What exactly?

1200
01:41:55.875 --> 01:41:56.708
What's happened?

1201
01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:01.500
I'm in love with someone

1202
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:03.791
other than Clifford.

1203
01:42:05.166 --> 01:42:06.375
So you've taken a lover?

1204
01:42:07.166 --> 01:42:08.416
Well. good.

1205
01:42:09.333 --> 01:42:10.291
Do I know the man?

1206
01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:12.750
No.

1207
01:42:13.666 --> 01:42:19.041
But I think I…
want a divorce from Clifford.

1208
01:42:20.125 --> 01:42:22.583
Because of your feelings
for this other man?

1209
01:42:25.541 --> 01:42:30.041
Well. if you want my opinion…

1210
01:42:31.416 --> 01:42:35.583
I'm sorry. but you stand to gain
very little by breaking things off.

1211
01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:37.541
Feelings come and go.

1212
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.666
You may love one man this year
and another the next.

1213
01:42:40.750 --> 01:42:42.541
but the world will go on.

1214
01:42:43.833 --> 01:42:45.666
And Wragby will go on standing.

1215
01:42:49.083 --> 01:42:50.250
Please yourself.

1216
01:42:51.083 --> 01:42:52.458
but stick by Wragby.

1217
01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.416
And Wragby will stick by you.

1218
01:42:58.416 --> 01:43:00.083
Let's go to Venice. shall we?

1219
01:43:47.041 --> 01:43:50.166
He comes back home
thinking he's better than the lot of us.

1220
01:43:50.666 --> 01:43:53.958
Gets the world to think poor Bertha's
to blame for all their trouble.

1221
01:43:54.041 --> 01:43:55.875
and then he refuses to support her.

1222
01:43:56.375 --> 01:43:57.958
-Bloody disgrace.
-I know.

1223
01:43:58.625 --> 01:44:01.958
Bertha goes to the cottage today.
trying to patch things up.

1224
01:44:02.041 --> 01:44:02.916
Makes sense.

1225
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
She found
them silk nightclothes in the fire.

1226
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.666
No wonder he keeps to himself.
He's hiding a woman in there.

1227
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:10.958
Lady Chatterley
loans her gamekeeper a book.

1228
01:44:11.041 --> 01:44:14.000
and she's accused of…
Sorry. that's outrageous.

1229
01:44:14.083 --> 01:44:16.708
Of course it is. I won't breathe
another word on the subject.

1230
01:44:16.791 --> 01:44:19.375
Everyone's talking about it.
You know how people gossip.

1231
01:44:19.458 --> 01:44:22.083
Sir. no one
wants to have this conversation.

1232
01:44:22.166 --> 01:44:23.166
but we must.

1233
01:44:23.791 --> 01:44:25.875
And of course.
it's pure nonsense.

1234
01:44:25.958 --> 01:44:28.833
But your gamekeeper
seems to inspire all manner of rumors.

1235
01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.750
The sooner you pack him off. the better.

1236
01:44:31.833 --> 01:44:33.833
I appreciate
you coming to me with this.

1237
01:44:33.916 --> 01:44:35.291
Your concerns are noted.

1238
01:44:44.416 --> 01:44:45.375
Hello…

1239
01:44:46.375 --> 01:44:48.291
I'd like a London number. please.

1240
01:44:49.458 --> 01:44:50.625
<i>Lady Chatterley.</i>

1241
01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:02.208
-Ayuh. Mrs. Bolton.
-Good day.

1242
01:45:02.791 --> 01:45:04.791
I hear Sir Clifford's asking for me.

1243
01:45:04.875 --> 01:45:06.833
Of course. yes. He's in his study.

1244
01:45:06.916 --> 01:45:07.958
Right. aye.

1245
01:45:08.833 --> 01:45:09.875
Mr. Mellors.

1246
01:45:10.458 --> 01:45:12.750
I called Her Ladyship.
and she's coming back.

1247
01:45:13.958 --> 01:45:15.583
-When?
-This evening.

1248
01:45:15.666 --> 01:45:17.458
As soon as she can get here.

1249
01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:20.375
She said you could meet at the hut
and decide what to do.

1250
01:45:25.083 --> 01:45:25.916
There's…

1251
01:45:27.583 --> 01:45:30.583
There's dark days coming. Mrs. Bolton.

1252
01:45:32.166 --> 01:45:33.791
Best to steer clear from it all.

1253
01:45:40.791 --> 01:45:41.666
Come in.

1254
01:45:53.666 --> 01:45:54.625
You are my servant.

1255
01:45:56.166 --> 01:45:58.708
living upon my land at my sole discretion.

1256
01:46:00.291 --> 01:46:03.500
and now your indecencies
have become the subject of gossip.

1257
01:46:05.458 --> 01:46:07.583
You should
shut the mouths of the gossips--

1258
01:46:07.666 --> 01:46:10.458
Are you aware that Lady Chatterley's
name has been slandered?

1259
01:46:10.958 --> 01:46:14.083
Apparently. her name was inscribed
in a book found at the cottage.

1260
01:46:18.250 --> 01:46:20.458
I've got a picture of Queen Mary
on me wall calendar.

1261
01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:22.375
I suppose she's in my harem as well.

1262
01:46:22.458 --> 01:46:26.041
I do not appreciate your sarcasm. Mellors.

1263
01:46:28.208 --> 01:46:29.833
You have until the end of today.

1264
01:46:30.833 --> 01:46:33.750
after which time I never want to see you
set foot upon my land again.

1265
01:46:33.833 --> 01:46:35.625
-Do I make myself clear?
-Oh. perfectly.

1266
01:46:36.333 --> 01:46:37.666
I better get packing then.

1267
01:46:51.625 --> 01:46:54.291
Mrs. Flint. Mrs. Flint. excuse me.

1268
01:46:54.375 --> 01:46:56.875
-I have to get Josephine to bed.
-I know you've heard things.

1269
01:46:56.958 --> 01:47:00.333
Please. I can't do this.
We lease this farm from Sir Clifford.

1270
01:47:00.416 --> 01:47:01.416
And you always will.

1271
01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:04.541
You met him here. didn't you?
The day he came to get milk?

1272
01:47:04.625 --> 01:47:06.875
-I thought you'd come to see us.
-Of course I did.

1273
01:47:06.958 --> 01:47:09.041
I found where you
parked the car in the trees.

1274
01:47:09.125 --> 01:47:12.000
-No. that was one time.
-I don't want to know.

1275
01:47:13.750 --> 01:47:15.291
Good evening. Lady Chatterley.

1276
01:47:42.125 --> 01:47:44.875
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1277
01:47:46.625 --> 01:47:47.541
Oliver.

1278
01:47:50.458 --> 01:47:52.916
The cat is well and truly
out of the bag now. Connie.

1279
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.291
Everybody's talking.

1280
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.125
I've been sacked.

1281
01:47:56.208 --> 01:47:59.250
You cannot be seen here. Connie.
You need to be in Venice.

1282
01:47:59.333 --> 01:48:03.125
-But we could just leave together. Now.
-Look at me.

1283
01:48:03.208 --> 01:48:04.583
I have nothing to give you.

1284
01:48:04.666 --> 01:48:07.916
I've no job. I've no home.
I've no purpose in life. Nothing.

1285
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:08.958
Don't say that.

1286
01:48:09.041 --> 01:48:10.625
You are everything to me.

1287
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:13.625
Mellors!

1288
01:48:15.958 --> 01:48:17.166
You need to go!

1289
01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:25.083
-Look at me.
-Shh.

1290
01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:28.375
Promise me. promise me
we'll share our lives.

1291
01:48:29.208 --> 01:48:30.791
-Aye.
-Promise.

1292
01:48:30.875 --> 01:48:32.625
Aye. me lass.

1293
01:48:32.708 --> 01:48:34.125
When the time comes.

1294
01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:36.166
When the time comes.

1295
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.500
-Mellors!
-Oh…

1296
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:44.666
Ayuh. can I grab me coat. mate. or…

1297
01:49:10.041 --> 01:49:11.083
I'll find you.

1298
01:49:12.666 --> 01:49:14.458
Wherever you are. I'll find you.

1299
01:50:10.916 --> 01:50:13.833
-My Ladyship. you shouldn't be here.
-No. Mrs. Bolton.

1300
01:50:18.333 --> 01:50:19.250
Connie.

1301
01:50:25.875 --> 01:50:26.791
It's all true.

1302
01:50:31.666 --> 01:50:32.916
Why would you do this?

1303
01:50:34.666 --> 01:50:37.666
-It was your idea.
-My idea? No. no. no.

1304
01:50:38.666 --> 01:50:41.125
Clifford. you knew perfectly well
what I was getting into.

1305
01:50:41.208 --> 01:50:44.375
With the right sort of man.
I said the right sort!

1306
01:50:44.458 --> 01:50:47.958
Oliver Mellors is a better person
than anyone I've ever met.

1307
01:50:48.958 --> 01:50:50.583
I was perfectly clear. Connie.

1308
01:50:51.166 --> 01:50:53.833
-We discussed the rules.
-I'm going to have his child.

1309
01:50:53.916 --> 01:50:54.916
You're going to--

1310
01:50:57.708 --> 01:50:58.625
You're sure?

1311
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.416
But… everybody knows.

1312
01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:06.958
You can't possibly expect me
to claim that child as mine now.

1313
01:51:07.041 --> 01:51:07.875
No. I…

1314
01:51:09.416 --> 01:51:10.250
I don't.

1315
01:51:12.541 --> 01:51:13.375
I don't.

1316
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:18.250
I want a divorce. Clifford.

1317
01:51:20.958 --> 01:51:21.791
I'm leaving you.

1318
01:51:24.458 --> 01:51:25.416
No. No. you can't.

1319
01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:28.958
Look. I'm… I'm so sorry
about how this has all turned out.

1320
01:51:29.041 --> 01:51:31.208
but we both know that this… marriage

1321
01:51:31.291 --> 01:51:33.666
has been very unhappy
for a very long time now.

1322
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:35.666
It hasn't been.
It hasn't been. Not for me.

1323
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:36.791
Well. yes.

1324
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:39.500
Because you laid out all the rules.

1325
01:51:41.208 --> 01:51:42.916
And I tried to follow them.

1326
01:51:45.041 --> 01:51:48.333
I tried to support you
in every way I could.

1327
01:51:50.541 --> 01:51:53.083
But you gave me
nothing in return.

1328
01:51:54.166 --> 01:51:57.500
Not the slightest drop
of affection or kindness.

1329
01:51:57.583 --> 01:52:01.750
And what's worse. you made me feel ashamed
for even wanting those things.

1330
01:52:01.833 --> 01:52:04.083
I've always cared for you. Connie.

1331
01:52:04.166 --> 01:52:05.500
Yes. cared for me.

1332
01:52:06.208 --> 01:52:09.375
In the same way you care
for your books and for your radio.

1333
01:52:09.458 --> 01:52:12.083
but never in the ways I need you to.

1334
01:52:12.166 --> 01:52:14.333
I love you. Connie.

1335
01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:18.583
I've loved you the only way I know how.

1336
01:52:19.833 --> 01:52:23.500
I've given you everything
I know how to give.

1337
01:52:27.958 --> 01:52:28.958
It's not enough.

1338
01:52:29.666 --> 01:52:31.125
Then talk to me. Con.

1339
01:52:33.208 --> 01:52:34.458
Help me understand.

1340
01:52:35.833 --> 01:52:39.375
Show me how I can prove to you how I feel.

1341
01:52:43.458 --> 01:52:44.375
Let me go.

1342
01:52:47.166 --> 01:52:48.083
Please.

1343
01:52:49.166 --> 01:52:50.250
Let me go.

1344
01:52:55.083 --> 01:52:55.916
Go.

1345
01:52:56.833 --> 01:52:57.708
Though know this.

1346
01:52:58.791 --> 01:53:02.125
I will never grant you your divorce.

1347
01:53:04.416 --> 01:53:05.916
Because you broke your word.

1348
01:53:07.541 --> 01:53:11.458
Because you've made a mockery
of my life here in Wragby.

1349
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:17.541
I am not inclined
to give you anything ever again.

1350
01:53:21.916 --> 01:53:23.708
I don't think you ever really were.

1351
01:53:43.875 --> 01:53:44.791
Milady.

1352
01:53:45.958 --> 01:53:46.916
Uh…

1353
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:51.250
I wasn't meaning to pry.
but I worried about you.

1354
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:54.333
I'm all right.

1355
01:53:57.791 --> 01:53:58.708
Listen.

1356
01:53:59.916 --> 01:54:02.208
You have no idea where Mellors has gone?

1357
01:54:02.291 --> 01:54:03.208
No.

1358
01:54:04.750 --> 01:54:09.291
Would you ask your friends
to let you know if they hear any news?

1359
01:54:11.166 --> 01:54:12.916
And why shall I say I'm asking?

1360
01:54:14.791 --> 01:54:15.791
Because I love him.

1361
01:54:17.333 --> 01:54:19.375
-Tell them that.
-Yes. milady.

1362
01:54:21.125 --> 01:54:22.000
Milady…

1363
01:54:25.166 --> 01:54:27.750
I do hope you find your gentleman.

1364
01:54:31.583 --> 01:54:32.916
Thank you. Mrs. Bolton.

1365
01:54:34.541 --> 01:54:35.416
So do I.

1366
01:54:36.583 --> 01:54:38.125
So do I.

1367
01:55:54.208 --> 01:55:55.750
<i>It's all true. then?</i>

1368
01:55:56.458 --> 01:55:58.208
<i>Has Her Ladyship left Sir Clifford?</i>

1369
01:55:59.708 --> 01:56:01.083
Her Ladyship has asked

1370
01:56:01.833 --> 01:56:04.666
that you will pass along
any news of Mr. Mellors.

1371
01:56:06.416 --> 01:56:08.750
"'Cause I love him." she said.

1372
01:56:09.666 --> 01:56:12.083
She gave up everything for him.

1373
01:56:12.166 --> 01:56:15.708
Her title. her wealth.
her position in the world.

1374
01:56:16.208 --> 01:56:17.458
Now she's lost him.

1375
01:56:21.625 --> 01:56:24.250
I'll not hear a word spoken against them.

1376
01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:27.833
This is a love story.

1377
01:57:37.458 --> 01:57:39.708
This place is losing its charm.
don't you think?

1378
01:57:39.791 --> 01:57:40.625
What?

1379
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.208
Let's go back to London.

1380
01:57:45.416 --> 01:57:46.291
All right.

1381
01:57:51.333 --> 01:57:53.666
I'm Connie Reid. I don't think we met.

1382
01:57:54.375 --> 01:57:55.666
Have a lovely evening.

1383
01:58:10.125 --> 01:58:12.083
How many times have you read that page?

1384
01:58:13.208 --> 01:58:14.125
What?

1385
01:58:15.916 --> 01:58:19.291
Well… it looks as though he's found you.

1386
01:58:30.041 --> 01:58:31.791
-Oh my God.
-Yes.

1387
01:58:34.541 --> 01:58:36.500
You'll want my car again. I imagine.

1388
01:58:45.166 --> 01:58:48.291
<i>You'll be impressed to learn</i>
<i>that word of your departure from Wragby</i>

1389
01:58:48.375 --> 01:58:50.958
<i>has made it all the way</i>
<i>to my little village in Scotland.</i>

1390
01:58:52.083 --> 01:58:56.166
<i>A man came to work in the local mines.</i>
<i>brought the tale with him.</i>

1391
01:58:56.250 --> 01:58:59.833
<i>telling everyone in the pub</i>
<i>about a lady who fell for a hired man</i>

1392
01:58:59.916 --> 01:59:03.541
<i>and didn't care if the world knew it</i>
<i>because… she loved him.</i>

1393
01:59:05.625 --> 01:59:07.291
<i>Names weren't used. of course.</i>

1394
01:59:11.416 --> 01:59:13.166
<i>I was simply "the gamekeeper."</i>

1395
01:59:14.125 --> 01:59:15.583
<i>You were the "Lady in love."</i>

1396
01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:21.083
Excuse me. I'm looking for Oliver Mellors.

1397
01:59:21.166 --> 01:59:22.708
Do you… Do you know him?

1398
01:59:22.791 --> 01:59:23.916
Oh yes. I do.

1399
01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.083
He's down that road.

1400
01:59:26.625 --> 01:59:28.625
Thank you. Thank you so much!

1401
01:59:31.208 --> 01:59:33.625
<i>It was a good story.</i>
<i>and I found myself wondering</i>

1402
01:59:33.708 --> 01:59:35.750
<i>if there might be more to the tale.</i>

1403
01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:40.083
<i>A feller I knew from the army</i>
<i>got me work at a farm here.</i>

1404
01:59:40.958 --> 01:59:42.125
<i>Thirty shillings a week</i>

1405
01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:44.500
<i>and decent lodgings</i>
<i>in a cottage up the road.</i>

1406
01:59:47.166 --> 01:59:48.583
<i>I thought I needed a purpose</i>

1407
01:59:48.666 --> 01:59:51.000
<i>before bringing you</i>
<i>and a child into my life.</i>

1408
01:59:53.041 --> 01:59:56.541
<i>I can't say I've found</i>
<i>any greater meaning here on the farm.</i>

1409
01:59:58.958 --> 02:00:00.083
<i>but I've made a home.</i>

1410
02:00:04.250 --> 02:00:06.833
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>what you've already been through</i>

1411
02:00:06.916 --> 02:00:08.791
<i>and how much you've already given up.</i>

1412
02:00:09.791 --> 02:00:12.500
<i>You'd be giving up even more</i>
<i>to come live here with me.</i>

1413
02:00:13.541 --> 02:00:14.375
<i>but…</i>

1414
02:00:14.958 --> 02:00:15.875
Oliver!

1415
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:22.500
<i>…what we have… together</i>

1416
02:00:23.875 --> 02:00:26.125
<i>is different than anything</i>
<i>I've ever known.</i>

1417
02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:36.250
<i>There's a little flame between us.</i>
<i>It's always burning.</i>

1418
02:00:38.166 --> 02:00:41.416
<i>And I've come to believe</i>
<i>that tending a fire like that is…</i>

1419
02:00:42.083 --> 02:00:43.708
<i>purpose enough for any life.</i>
