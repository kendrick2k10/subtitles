that whatever happens
let's be friends.

happen but she kissed me.

for a few seconds.

- So you kissed her back?

You didn't seem drunk
when you came home.

You didn't seem buzzed when
you walked in the door.

half. three hours later.

had to make sure all

of before I headed out.

710
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.280
- Just put on the shirt please.

711
00:24:49.315 --> 00:24:50.627

00:32:36.816 --> 00:32:39.060
I'm not familiar with that term.

900
00:32:39.095 --> 00:32:40.441
- Conditional will?

901
00:32:40.475 --> 00:32:41.856
- Yeah. what is a
conditional will?

902
00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.962
- Where are you
getting that from?

903
00:32:43.996 --> 00:32:46.481
- I saw your dad texted you.
he's been trying to reach you.

904
00:32:46.516 --> 00:32:48.518
and the last text
that came through.

905
00:32:48.552 --> 00:32:51.038
said he wanted to talk about
a conditional will ASAP.

906
00:32:51.072 --> 00:32:53.385
- Why are you
looking at my phone?

907
00:32:53.419 --> 00:32:54.627
- It was right there.

908
00:32:54.662 --> 00:32:55.283
It was on the bed.
- Like a creep.

909
00:32:55.318 --> 00:32:55.974
- I saw it.

910
00:32:56.008 --> 00:32:57.078
Like a creep?

911
00:32:57.113 --> 00:32:58.459
Baby.

912
00:32:58.493 --> 00:33:00.150
- Why are you
looking at my phone?

913
00:33:00.185 --> 00:33:02.601
Also. let me handle my
stuff myself please.

914
00:33:02.635 --> 00:33:04.085
I'll call my dad.
I'll deal with it.

915
00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.604
- Why are you being
all secretive?

916
00:33:05.638 --> 00:33:06.639
I'm just curious.

917
00:33:06.674 --> 00:33:08.400
- It feels a little weird
that you would be obsessing

918
00:33:08.434 --> 00:33:09.953
over a will that
has to do with me

919
00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:12.231
and money and my
family's situation

920
00:33:12.266 --> 00:33:13.336
when my Grams is about to die.

921
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.407
- Whoa. whoa whoa whoa.

922
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:18.030
- This is stuff I need to
talk to my family about.

923
00:33:18.065 --> 00:33:19.376
- No. no. no.

924
00:33:19.411 --> 00:33:20.860
I'm trying to be open
and authentic and honest.

925
00:33:20.895 --> 00:33:22.483
This is not a
contentious thing at all.

926
00:33:22.517 --> 00:33:24.278
I wanna know what's
going on in your life

927
00:33:24.312 --> 00:33:26.004
and you're shutting me out.

928
00:33:26.038 --> 00:33:27.453
That's how it feels.

929
00:33:27.488 --> 00:33:30.042
You want me to open up entirely
and you're shutting me out.

930
00:33:30.077 --> 00:33:30.870
It feels shitty.

931
00:33:30.905 --> 00:33:32.217
It feels really shitty.

932
00:33:32.251 --> 00:33:35.047
Can you just tell me
what's going on. please?

933
00:33:35.082 --> 00:33:37.739
- Fine. you promise
not to freak out?

934
00:33:37.774 --> 00:33:38.878
- Should I?

935
00:33:38.913 --> 00:33:40.604
- I don't know.
- Why would I freak out?

936
00:33:40.639 --> 00:33:41.743
- We'll see what you do.

937
00:33:41.778 --> 00:33:43.159
- Why would I freak out?
- I don't know.

938
00:33:43.193 --> 00:33:44.401
It's a little bit of
a weird situation.

939
00:33:44.436 --> 00:33:45.816
Do you wanna hear it?

940
00:33:45.851 --> 00:33:48.750
All right. let's do it.
on camera. let's go.

941
00:33:48.785 --> 00:33:49.579
Set up for another shot.

942
00:33:49.613 --> 00:33:51.270
It's shitty in here.

943
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.584
- Peter. are you
getting the beach club?

944
00:33:54.618 --> 00:33:56.344
[bird chirping]

945
00:33:56.379 --> 00:33:57.483
I love it.

946
00:33:57.518 --> 00:33:58.657
- Go ahead.

947
00:33:58.691 --> 00:34:01.384
It's okay. come on up.
- It's all good.

948
00:34:01.418 --> 00:34:03.524
- It's all right.

949
00:34:03.558 --> 00:34:05.905
We're just having a
revelatory moment here.

950
00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.529
[Chuckles]

951
00:34:12.602 --> 00:34:16.330
- Okay. so. my Grams and
I had a special bond.

952
00:34:19.747 --> 00:34:21.162
We had a lot in common.

953
00:34:21.197 --> 00:34:24.062
She and I are way closer
than she was to my cousins.

954
00:34:24.096 --> 00:34:26.409
She knew I was a wild child.

955
00:34:27.858 --> 00:34:30.033
She had kind of the same
experience with depression

956
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.241
and not getting
married till later

957
00:34:31.276 --> 00:34:34.417
and she wanted to be
married by age 30.

958
00:34:34.451 --> 00:34:37.420
And so she basically said that
I would get some extra money

959
00:34:37.454 --> 00:34:39.387
if I was married by 30.

960
00:34:40.561 --> 00:34:41.734
- Some extra money.

961
00:34:41.769 --> 00:34:43.011
So how much money are
you talking about?

962
00:34:43.046 --> 00:34:44.806
- That's the conditional will.

963
00:34:44.841 --> 00:34:46.256
- Okay.

964
00:34:46.291 --> 00:34:48.431
So you get more money than
the rest of you family

965
00:34:48.465 --> 00:34:50.191
if you get married by 30?

966
00:34:50.226 --> 00:34:55.162
- Yes. but she has to die
before the money happens

967
00:34:55.196 --> 00:34:58.337
which is why I'm getting
all these phone calls

968
00:34:58.372 --> 00:35:00.132
from my dad.

969
00:35:00.167 --> 00:35:03.411
- So you're incentivized
to get married by 30?

970
00:35:03.446 --> 00:35:04.826
- But that has nothing to do

971
00:35:04.861 --> 00:35:06.621
with why I asked
you to marry me.

972
00:35:06.656 --> 00:35:08.830
I want to marry you.

973
00:35:08.865 --> 00:35:10.453
I wanna be with you.

974
00:35:10.487 --> 00:35:12.282
- Why are you even saying that?

975
00:35:12.317 --> 00:35:13.904
That's a weird thing to say.

976
00:35:13.939 --> 00:35:15.389
I mean. I didn't doubt that.

977
00:35:15.423 --> 00:35:18.150
I wanna know about the
conditions of the will.

978
00:35:18.185 --> 00:35:20.463
- I just told you.

979
00:35:20.497 --> 00:35:22.603
- How much money is this?

980
00:35:24.294 --> 00:35:25.640
- Well. I'm not gonna
say that on camera.

981
00:35:25.675 --> 00:35:27.021
- Why not?
- That's like insane.

982
00:35:27.055 --> 00:35:28.367
- We're being authentic.
we're being raw.

983
00:35:28.402 --> 00:35:29.299
we're being honest.

984
00:35:29.334 --> 00:35:31.439
Why don't you say what it is?

985
00:35:31.474 --> 00:35:32.337
- They're just people.

986
00:35:32.371 --> 00:35:33.441
People are going by.

987
00:35:33.476 --> 00:35:34.511
We're in a public space.
- Yeah. I don't care.

988
00:35:34.546 --> 00:35:35.788
- People are gonna walk by.

989
00:35:35.823 --> 00:35:38.481
How much are you set to inherit?

990
00:35:39.827 --> 00:35:40.724
I'm just curious.

991
00:35:40.759 --> 00:35:42.312
Is this something that's--

992
00:35:42.347 --> 00:35:46.868
- I'll talk to you about it
when we're not on camera.

993
00:35:46.903 --> 00:35:48.422
- You're acting really strange.

994
00:35:48.456 --> 00:35:49.940
- No. I'm not.

995
00:35:49.975 --> 00:35:53.841
I'm not gonna tell people what
my blood type is on camera.

996
00:35:53.875 --> 00:35:55.636
- How much money is it?
- Or what's in my account.

997
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.914
- Why don't you just tell me
how much money it is.
- No!

998
00:35:57.948 --> 00:35:59.847
I'll tell you when
we're on our own.

999
00:35:59.881 --> 00:36:01.124
Why are you obsessing?

1000
00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:02.574
Now it sounds like
you want my money.

1001
00:36:02.608 --> 00:36:04.265
Now that's what it sounds like.

1002
00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.198
- I feel a lot of
tension in my neck.

1003
00:36:06.233 --> 00:36:07.717
I'm gonna go stretch out.

1004
00:36:07.751 --> 00:36:12.204
You and the cameraman can have
fun making your reality show.

1005
00:36:12.239 --> 00:36:13.067
- Yeah. we will.

1006
00:36:13.101 --> 00:36:13.895
- [Abe] Bye dude.

1007
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:14.931
- It's gonna be a hit!

00:36:14.965 --> 00:36:16.622
- [Abe] Weird!

1009
00:36:16.657 --> 00:36:19.004

[birds chirping]

[upbeat music]

1012
00:36:34.295 --> 00:36:35.848
Fucking key.

[door clicks]

1014
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:40.405
What are you doing?

1015
00:36:40.439 --> 00:36:42.234
- Just doing stretches.

1016
00:36:42.269 --> 00:36:43.408
- Why'd you leave me down there?

1017
00:36:43.442 --> 00:36:44.271
[door bangs]

1018
00:36:44.305 --> 00:36:45.617
- Because my back and
neck are bothering me

1019
00:36:45.651 --> 00:36:48.275
and there's nothing else to say.

1020
00:36:50.173 --> 00:36:52.934
- I think there are
other things to say.

1021
00:36:52.969 --> 00:36:54.004
You're being a jerk.

1022
00:36:54.039 --> 00:36:55.454
- How am I being a jerk?

1023
00:36:55.489 --> 00:36:57.663
You're not being honest with me.

1024
00:36:57.698 --> 00:36:59.734
You want me to be totally
honest and raw with you

1025
00:36:59.769 --> 00:37:01.219
and you're being hypocritical.

1026
00:37:01.253 --> 00:37:02.737
It's not cool.

1027
00:37:02.772 --> 00:37:03.842
- How am I not being honest?

1028
00:37:03.876 --> 00:37:05.706
I just told you everything.

1029
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:07.915
- How much money are
you set to inherit?

1030
00:37:07.949 --> 00:37:09.951
- Oh my God. the
amount of money.

1031
00:37:09.986 --> 00:37:13.127
There's a reason why people
don't talk about numbers

they have on camera.

1033

Hello. everyone that

- You want me to act
really authentic.

00:37:22.481 --> 00:37:24.172
you want me to act very honest.

1038
00:37:24.207 --> 00:37:26.278

you to be clear with me

1039

by 30 when Grams dies.

- If Grams dies. yeah.

1046

- It's not that much money.

1047
00:37:39.326 --> 00:37:40.982
- $3.000.000 is a lot of money!

- No. it's not.

1049
00:37:42.536 --> 00:37:45.193
- That's like 30 years of a
person with a good salary.

How's that not.

1051
00:37:46.436 --> 00:37:48.196
in what world is that
not a lot of money?

1052
00:37:48.231 --> 00:37:49.957
- That's like enough to buy
a house in our neighborhood

1053
00:37:49.991 --> 00:37:52.131
and go on some cruises.

1054
00:37:52.166 --> 00:37:53.857
- What are you talking about?!

1055
00:37:53.892 --> 00:37:56.239
- It sounds like you care
about money a lot right now.

1056
00:37:56.274 --> 00:37:58.103
- I care about you
being honest with me.

1057

You're gonna inherit $3.000.000?

1058
00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.074
When were you
gonna tell me this?

1059
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:05.904
- I don't know.

1060
00:38:05.938 --> 00:38:08.113
I didn't wanna think about
Grams dying. that's for sure.

1061
00:38:08.147 --> 00:38:09.217
I don't know.

1062
00:38:10.322 --> 00:38:11.634
- How am I supposed
to feel about this?

1063
00:38:11.668 --> 00:38:13.498
It's got me feeling like--

1064
00:38:13.532 --> 00:38:17.191
- That's not why I asked
you to marry me. okay?

1065
00:38:17.225 --> 00:38:19.331
- Well. it feels like
it's awfully convenient

1066
00:38:19.366 --> 00:38:21.091
that you want me
to marry you now.

1067
00:38:21.126 --> 00:38:22.438
I don't know.

- No. babe.

You know I'm a boss bitch. okay?

01:13:59.504 --> 01:14:01.471
- That's true. yeah.

1950
01:14:01.506 --> 01:14:03.473
You got Peter here.

1951
01:14:03.508 --> 01:14:04.474
- [Peter] What's up bro!
- Yeah.

1952
01:14:04.509 --> 01:14:05.958
We had to come find you.

1953
01:14:05.993 --> 01:14:08.271
- You like stalking my
Instagram or something?

1954
01:14:08.305 --> 01:14:09.962
- Yeah. yeah. I did.

1955
01:14:10.894 --> 01:14:11.930
I need you to sign this.

1956
01:14:11.964 --> 01:14:13.379
- What is that?

1957
01:14:13.414 --> 01:14:15.312
- It's a release. for our movie.

1958
01:14:15.347 --> 01:14:17.487
- Can we not get
into this here. now?

1959
01:14:17.522 --> 01:14:19.040
- We just need to go talk.

1960
01:14:19.075 --> 01:14:19.869
Can we go talk?

1961
01:14:19.903 --> 01:14:20.939
Please?

1962
01:14:20.973 --> 01:14:23.528
[Abe sighs]

1963
01:14:23.562 --> 01:14:25.081
Let's go sit down.

1964
01:14:25.944 --> 01:14:26.876
- Okay fine.

1965
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:27.704
I'll sit down. okay.

1966
01:14:27.739 --> 01:14:28.567
- Come on. come on.

1967
01:14:28.602 --> 01:14:29.465
It's okay.

1968
01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:33.503
How do we look?

1969
01:14:33.538 --> 01:14:34.573
Light good?

1970
01:14:34.608 --> 01:14:36.644
- [Peter] Looks perfect.

1971
01:14:36.679 --> 01:14:38.404
- It's good to see you.

1972
01:14:38.439 --> 01:14:40.096
- It is good to see you.

1973
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:41.028
- You look great!

1974
01:14:41.062 --> 01:14:42.098
- You look really good.

1975
01:14:42.132 --> 01:14:43.513
- Thanks.

1976
01:14:43.548 --> 01:14:45.791
- You look beautiful as
always. to be totally honest.

1977
01:14:45.826 --> 01:14:46.827
- Thank you.

1978
01:14:48.207 --> 01:14:50.002
I have to ask.

1979
01:14:50.037 --> 01:14:52.384
Why have you been ignoring me?

1980
01:14:52.418 --> 01:14:54.006
Like what the hell?

1981
01:14:55.421 --> 01:14:57.838
- Honestly. I'm really regretful

1982
01:14:57.872 --> 01:15:00.530
about the way
everything played out

1983
01:15:00.565 --> 01:15:04.016
and I said some
really shitty things.

1984
01:15:04.051 --> 01:15:07.503
And that the fact that
that's all. I don't know

1985
01:15:07.537 --> 01:15:09.435
fuckin' recorded
somewhere is scary

1986
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:12.093
and I've been trying
not to think about it

1987
01:15:12.128 --> 01:15:13.336
to be honest.

1988
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:14.717
Yeah. just been
trying to move on.

1989
01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:15.787
- I get that.

1990
01:15:18.341 --> 01:15:20.205
I was really shitty too.

1991
01:15:20.239 --> 01:15:21.689
- Yeah we were pretty
shitty to each other.

1992
01:15:21.724 --> 01:15:22.897
- I'm really sorry.

1993
01:15:22.932 --> 01:15:24.140
- You're sorry?

1994
01:15:24.174 --> 01:15:27.212
- Yeah. I'm sorry it
got as bad as it did.

1995
01:15:27.246 --> 01:15:29.455
That's not what I wanted at all.

1996
01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:32.286
- What exactly are
you sorry about?

1997
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.391
- Sorry for being mean to you.

1998
01:15:34.426 --> 01:15:36.773
- I'm definitely sorry for
being that mean to you.

1999
01:15:36.808 --> 01:15:38.085
I think it was
really unwarranted

2000
01:15:38.119 --> 01:15:40.121
and maybe even having
the camera there.

2001
01:15:40.156 --> 01:15:41.675
made us act a
little differently.

2002
01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:42.607
- Sure.

2003
01:15:42.641 --> 01:15:44.574
- It got pretty fucked up.

2004
01:15:44.609 --> 01:15:46.576
- I do wanna say though.

2005
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:50.097
it made a really good movie.

2006
01:15:52.099 --> 01:15:54.757
Yeah. like Peter
shot it so well.

2007
01:15:56.172 --> 01:15:58.208
This could go to
like festivals. dude.

2008
01:15:58.243 --> 01:15:59.589
You have to see it.

2009
01:15:59.624 --> 01:16:01.418
- So us being
shitty to each other

2010
01:16:01.453 --> 01:16:03.213
in Vegas could go to festivals?

2011
01:16:03.248 --> 01:16:06.285
- I'm just saying. I don't
want Grandma getting sick

2012
01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:10.289
and our relationship going
to shit to be for nothing.

2013
01:16:10.324 --> 01:16:11.636
- Well. a big part
of me feels like

2014
01:16:11.670 --> 01:16:13.948
we should take the
footage and set it on fire

2015
01:16:13.983 --> 01:16:17.849
and show it to no one because
we are so shitty in it.

2016
01:16:17.883 --> 01:16:19.126
- This could be
good for Shmooly.

2017
01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.129
this would be good
for you. I promise.

2018
01:16:22.163 --> 01:16:23.820
The content is dope.

2019
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:26.478
I just need you do sign this.

2020
01:16:26.512 --> 01:16:27.859
and we can move forward with it.

2021
01:16:27.893 --> 01:16:28.687
I think--

2022
01:16:28.722 --> 01:16:31.172
[Abe laughing]

2023
01:16:31.207 --> 01:16:32.864
It's just a release.

2024
01:16:34.451 --> 01:16:35.625
- I'll take a look
at the footage

2025
01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:39.249
and if it's not the
worst thing ever. maybe.

2026
01:16:40.423 --> 01:16:42.218
- I'm happy to show
it to you. seriously.

2027
01:16:42.252 --> 01:16:43.737
You're great in it.
[Abe laughs]

2028
01:16:43.771 --> 01:16:47.948
Also. I would love it if you
edited. just to give some--

2029
01:16:47.982 --> 01:16:49.639
- Now it all makes sense.

2030
01:16:49.674 --> 01:16:51.330
Okay you want me to
edit the footage.

2031
01:16:51.365 --> 01:16:54.264
- Well no. just to give some
of your perspective on it.

2032
01:16:54.299 --> 01:16:56.266
So it's coming from both of us.
I wanna be partners on this.

2033
01:16:56.301 --> 01:16:58.027
- Okay. I will take a
look at the footage.

2034
01:16:58.061 --> 01:16:59.511
and we can go from there.

2035
01:16:59.545 --> 01:17:01.478
I'm not gonna sign anything
but show me the footage.

2036
01:17:01.513 --> 01:17:03.170
- You're gonna like it.

2037
01:17:03.204 --> 01:17:07.450
- I'm sure I'm gonna have
some kind of response to it.

2038
01:17:07.484 --> 01:17:10.936
- And honestly. I do
really care about you.

2039
01:17:10.971 --> 01:17:12.904
and I am very sorry that
it turned out like this.

2040
01:17:12.938 --> 01:17:15.216
and I do want us to be friends.

2041
01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:16.804
Seriously.

2042
01:17:16.839 --> 01:17:19.358
- I meant that.
when I said that.

2043
01:17:19.393 --> 01:17:21.188
I think that would be cool.

2044
01:17:21.222 --> 01:17:22.948
And I don't hate you.

2045
01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.606
- I don't hate you either.

2046
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.677
- I mean in the
moment I felt that.

2047
01:17:27.712 --> 01:17:29.541
I was like. fucking A

2048
01:17:29.575 --> 01:17:30.991
I hate her in that moment.

2049
01:17:31.025 --> 01:17:33.510
But I don't feel that.
- Just give me a hug.

2050
01:17:33.545 --> 01:17:34.442
- Okay.

2051
01:17:34.477 --> 01:17:36.686
- Just give me a hug please.

2052
01:17:41.829 --> 01:17:44.660

good to see you.
