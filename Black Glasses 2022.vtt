3
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.856
They bark because they're afraid.

4
00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.796
Not just dogs. every animal is afraid.

5
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.906
Even our ancestors. a
long time ago. feared the eclipse.

6
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.925
They thought the disappearance of
the Sun meant the end of the world.

7
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.527
What's wrong. dear?

8
00:06:04.525 --> 00:06:07.161
- You forgot.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

9
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.298
You see?
I lose my head when I'm with you.

10
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.355
- Should I call for a cab?
- No. thanks. Carlo.

11
00:07:32.567 --> 00:07:34.476
Stay calm. stay calm!

12
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.400
My God...

13
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.316
What the hell happened?!

14
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.309
I'll call the police!

15
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.916
Homicides. chief inspector Aleardi.

16
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.713
- Was she a client of the hotel?
- No. just passing by.

17
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.596
Actually. she went into
the room of one of our clients.

18
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.067
An escort.

19
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.886
And the client that was with
her is still in his room?

20
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.336
- Yes.
- Good.

21
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.936
Bring him downstairs.
we need to speak to him.

22
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.396
Did you notice anything that would
justify such a horrible murder?

23
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.900
Inspector...

24
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.523
I might...

25
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.330
I might've seen...

26
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.296
A van. speeding out
of the parking lot.

27
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.116
They were going so fast that...

28
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.906
They crashed into a parked car...

29
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.535
Did you see who was driving?

30
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.880
No. it was dark.

31
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.656
Maybe we'll get more
out of the surveillance cameras.

32
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.150
Of course.

33
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.191
You can't tell with a naked eye

34
00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:15.716
but they surely left
some paint behind.

35
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.847
Bring over the forensic crew.

36
00:09:17.931 --> 00:09:20.336
and let's see what the lab will find.

37
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:25.918
Meanwhile. this car is impounded
while we run the investigation.

38
00:09:32.858 --> 00:09:34.899
Diana. you won't take off the glasses?

39
00:09:34.983 --> 00:09:38.576
No baby. my eyes got
hurt looking at the eclipse.

40
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.746
Did you see it?

41
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.966
Yes. but I had protection.

42
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.986
Neither the sun nor death
can be looked at steadily.

43
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.736
Some French writer said that.
but I can't remember his name.

44
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.356
Come on. take them off.

45
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.415
Don't worry about that. I can still
find your big swinger.

46
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.024
You know. you're expensive.

47
00:10:02.108 --> 00:10:04.540
But it's worth it.
You deserve it.

48
00:10:04.624 --> 00:10:07.480
- Thanks. honey.
- Diana. you're amazing.

49
00:10:07.564 --> 00:10:09.914
Strong. independent...

50
00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:12.430
I might fall in love with you.

51
00:10:12.514 --> 00:10:14.890
Don't. otherwise. you
wouldn't have fun anymore. right?

52
00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:19.250
You like me the way
I am. your own personal Diana.

53
00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:22.034
Thanks.

54
00:10:23.884 --> 00:10:27.899
Whenever you want.
you know where to find me...

55
00:11:04.214 --> 00:11:06.396
- Can you go back?
- Yes.

56
00:11:07.204 --> 00:11:09.310
Damn it. the image is out of focus.

57
00:11:09.394 --> 00:11:13.450
Can't see a thing. the man entering
the van looks like a ghost.

58
00:11:13.534 --> 00:11:16.000
Unfortunately. it's all we have.

59
00:11:16.084 --> 00:11:19.540
Yes. but now we now the
suspected killer has a black van.

60
00:11:19.624 --> 00:11:22.540
That's not all.
look at the license plate.

61
00:11:22.624 --> 00:11:25.591
Let's check. it's probably stolen.

62
00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:28.921
Let's do that. you never know.

63
00:11:55.864 --> 00:11:57.550
Is that you. Diana?

64
00:11:57.634 --> 00:12:00.601
- Yes.
- I'm the one from the chat.

65
00:12:01.525 --> 00:12:02.775
Matteo...

66
00:12:03.904 --> 00:12:05.722
Please. come inside.

67
00:12:28.144 --> 00:12:30.914
What is that smell?
You stink!

68
00:12:33.404 --> 00:12:37.331
I got sweaty. just got
done working with dogs.

69
00:12:37.804 --> 00:12:40.441
Fine. honey. but first take
a shower. OK?

70
00:12:40.525 --> 00:12:44.714
Otherwise. we won't be
doing anything. Clear? OK?

71
00:12:54.064 --> 00:12:55.064
Well?

72
00:12:55.354 --> 00:12:57.880
What did you do all this time?

73
00:12:57.964 --> 00:12:59.382
I stank. huh?

74
00:13:01.174 --> 00:13:02.810
Goodbye. whore.

75
00:13:47.404 --> 00:13:49.000
Let me look at you.

76
00:13:49.084 --> 00:13:52.233
- I bet you're willing to do anything...
- No.

77
00:13:52.864 --> 00:13:54.591
What if I wanted...

78
00:13:54.675 --> 00:13:56.716
- ''The F and F.''
- Ah. I'm sorry. no.

79
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.255
- I don't do that.
- Wait...

80
00:14:00.675 --> 00:14:02.566
- Look...
- No. I know what fisting is.

81
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.694
but I don't do those
disgusting things. OK?

82
00:14:04.774 --> 00:14:06.710
I'm sorry. but what's the problem?

83
00:14:06.794 --> 00:14:08.359
Eh? I'll give you pleasure.

84
00:14:08.443 --> 00:14:12.524
Listen. I don't want orgasms.
specially from you. OK?

85
00:14:12.608 --> 00:14:14.650
Listen then. forgive me...

86
00:14:14.734 --> 00:14:16.642
I'll give you a pretty penny...

87
00:14:16.726 --> 00:14:18.274
It's not about the money.

88
00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:22.150
it's about me not doing
those disgusting things!

89
00:14:22.234 --> 00:14:24.143
I'll handle it. then.

90
00:14:27.275 --> 00:14:31.067
What the fuck did you do?!
Stupid whore!

91
00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:37.042
Asshole. go fuck yourself!

92
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:32.650
Fuck me!

93
00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:38.108
Who the fuck are you?!

94
00:15:38.192 --> 00:15:39.817
Go away!

95
00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:17.385
- The kid!
- Let's take him out!

96
00:17:19.808 --> 00:17:21.488
Call an ambulance!

97
00:18:17.317 --> 00:18:19.694
Diana.
How do you feel?

98
00:18:20.764 --> 00:18:22.741
I don't know. everything's dark.

99
00:18:22.825 --> 00:18:25.967
I can't see. as if it was nighttime.

100
00:18:27.084 --> 00:18:29.230
Do you remember the accident?

101
00:18:29.314 --> 00:18:30.733
Vaguely.

102
00:18:32.094 --> 00:18:34.480
Now. listen to me carefully.

103
00:18:34.564 --> 00:18:37.090
Even if the prognosis
is not definitive yet.

104
00:18:37.174 --> 00:18:40.660
you experienced a very violent
impact to your neck

105
00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:43.108
which caused a hemorrhage.

106
00:18:44.554 --> 00:18:47.500
In correspondence
to the visual cortex.

107
00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:49.840
the one we call
''Brodmann area.''

108
00:18:49.924 --> 00:18:52.210
This is the reason why can't see.

109
00:18:52.294 --> 00:18:53.974
What does it mean?

110
00:18:54.754 --> 00:18:58.390
- I won't see ever again?
- You must be strong.

111
00:18:58.474 --> 00:19:00.899
Even when the hemorrhage is
completely reabsorbed

112
00:19:00.983 --> 00:19:03.640
the chances of getting
your sight back are...

113
00:19:03.724 --> 00:19:06.179
Very scarce. unfortunately.

114
00:19:06.424 --> 00:19:10.450
The important thing is that you are
conscious. and the fact you're alive...

115
00:19:10.534 --> 00:19:12.242
It's a miracle...

116
00:19:12.654 --> 00:19:15.076
You'll have the time to
give us clearer answers.

117
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.564
In a few days
you will be able to leave.

118
00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:20.951
I'll see you later.

119
00:20:00.644 --> 00:20:02.630
Did you see the man that attacked you?

120
00:20:02.714 --> 00:20:04.523
No. he had a hood on.

121
00:20:04.834 --> 00:20:07.640
Regardless. it was at
night. everything was dark.

122
00:20:07.724 --> 00:20:10.358
Miss. please try harder.
we're not against you.

123
00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:12.351
What do you remember?

124
00:20:12.614 --> 00:20:14.544
I can't remember...

125
00:20:15.494 --> 00:20:17.480
You said you were chased by car.

126
00:20:17.564 --> 00:20:20.192
Not a car. a white van.

127
00:20:20.317 --> 00:20:21.410
- White?
- Yes.

128
00:20:21.494 --> 00:20:23.403
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

129
00:20:23.564 --> 00:20:26.899
He might've repainted it.
it could be a clue.

130
00:20:26.983 --> 00:20:29.165
Or he painted it myself.

131
00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:30.950
Back to square one.

132
00:20:31.034 --> 00:20:33.733
And do you have any idea
why he was coming for you?

133
00:20:33.817 --> 00:20:35.210
I don't know.

134
00:20:35.294 --> 00:20:37.160
Maybe he thought I was someone else.

135
00:20:37.244 --> 00:20:38.294
Maybe...

136
00:20:38.784 --> 00:20:40.957
Because of your profession.
shall we say?

137
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:43.741
Excuse me. what are you implying?

138
00:20:43.934 --> 00:20:45.554
No. I mean...

139
00:20:46.034 --> 00:20:49.263
We. the police know everything. miss.

140
00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:52.730
You're the fourth one.

141
00:20:52.814 --> 00:20:55.220
There were three other
victims before yourself.

142
00:20:55.304 --> 00:20:56.984
All prostitutes.

143
00:21:00.554 --> 00:21:04.370
And what happened to
the people in the other car?

144
00:21:04.454 --> 00:21:05.720
They were three.

145
00:21:05.804 --> 00:21:07.484
A Chinese family.

146
00:21:07.694 --> 00:21:11.180
The father died instantly
and the mother is in a coma.

147
00:21:11.264 --> 00:21:13.280
The only survivor is the son.

148
00:21:13.364 --> 00:21:17.324
Ten years old who is
currently in a shelter.

149
00:21:28.184 --> 00:21:30.002
<i>Punishment of God...</i>

150
00:21:31.094 --> 00:21:32.403
I heard you.

151
00:21:33.134 --> 00:21:34.443
I heard you.

152
00:21:35.025 --> 00:21:36.705
Where are you...

153
00:21:38.654 --> 00:21:40.644
Fuck... Get out!

154
00:21:40.844 --> 00:21:43.774
- Get out of my house!
- I can't leave you alone in this state!

155
00:21:43.858 --> 00:21:45.983
I'll get by on my own.
as I always have.

156
00:21:46.067 --> 00:21:47.692
Go. go away!

157
00:21:52.634 --> 00:21:55.120
<i>Mother of God.</i> I will pray for you.

158
00:21:55.204 --> 00:21:56.904
Pray. pray...

159
00:22:00.025 --> 00:22:05.000
It's useless. God doesn't have
time for someone like me...

160
00:22:21.404 --> 00:22:22.495
Who is it?

161
00:22:22.684 --> 00:22:24.957
<i>I'm Rita. the instructor.</i>

162
00:22:25.108 --> 00:22:30.519
<i>I was sent by the Union of the
Blind and the Visually Impaired.</i>

163
00:22:32.483 --> 00:22:34.108
Hello. can I?

164
00:22:34.244 --> 00:22:35.567
Please.

165
00:22:36.025 --> 00:22:37.334
My pleasure.

166
00:22:39.764 --> 00:22:44.040
Grab my arm here.
above the elbow. I'll guide you.

167
00:22:47.714 --> 00:22:49.794
- In here?
- Yes.

168
00:22:50.594 --> 00:22:53.441
- Where can we sit?
- Let's go outside.

169
00:22:53.525 --> 00:22:54.525
Come.

170
00:22:55.664 --> 00:22:59.250
As I told you on the phone.
you can count on me now.

171
00:22:59.334 --> 00:23:02.816
Us mobility and orientation
instructors are used to working

172
00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.945
with people who have
the same problem as you do.

173
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:10.880
Together. we will start a lifestyle
to adapt to your new condition.

174
00:23:10.964 --> 00:23:15.260
You'll see that rehabilitation
will render you independent.

175
00:23:15.344 --> 00:23:17.708
And how long will it take?

176
00:23:17.894 --> 00:23:20.167
That is quite subjective.

177
00:23:20.324 --> 00:23:22.160
It depends on your commitment.

178
00:23:22.244 --> 00:23:23.662
on your will.

179
00:23:25.244 --> 00:23:29.066
Diana. before the accident.
were you organized?

180
00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.900
Excuse me. but why does that matter?

181
00:23:30.984 --> 00:23:33.650
Well. now you have to
become even more organized.

182
00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:35.750
Inside the house
you can do everything.

183
00:23:35.834 --> 00:23:40.100
all you need are reference points
to move around in an environment.

184
00:23:40.184 --> 00:23:43.500
Can you tell me where the entrance is?

185
00:23:45.494 --> 00:23:47.858
Good. that's a good start.

186
00:23:48.524 --> 00:23:52.100
I have brought you some aids
that will be indispensable to you.

187
00:23:52.184 --> 00:23:53.540
For example. here.

188
00:23:53.624 --> 00:23:55.700
This is your white cane.

189
00:23:55.784 --> 00:24:00.110
With this you will learn how to
move in and out of the house.

190
00:24:00.194 --> 00:24:04.190
And I also brought you a cell phone
that has accessibility for the blind.

191
00:24:04.274 --> 00:24:08.390
Once activated with your voice you can
send text messages or make phone calls.

192
00:24:08.474 --> 00:24:12.674
And moving your finger across the screen
will tell you what you are touching.

193
00:24:12.758 --> 00:24:16.158
If someone calls you. it
will announce their name.

194
00:24:16.242 --> 00:24:19.025
OK. thank you.

195
00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:22.608
Do you hear the traffic?
You have to use it as guide.

196
00:24:22.692 --> 00:24:25.421
to understand where you have to walk.

197
00:24:27.584 --> 00:24:30.402
That's where the sidewalk ends.

198
00:24:31.424 --> 00:24:33.440
Good job. use the traffic.

199
00:24:33.524 --> 00:24:38.290
You will see that your sense of
direction will improve over time.

200
00:24:38.374 --> 00:24:39.690
Give me your hand.

201
00:24:39.774 --> 00:24:41.540
Down here there's a button.

202
00:24:41.624 --> 00:24:44.930
If you press it. after a few seconds.
it changes from red to green.

203
00:24:45.014 --> 00:24:48.440
A beep will tell you how
much time you have to cross.

204
00:24:48.524 --> 00:24:51.150
Shall we?
Come on. push.

205
00:24:56.608 --> 00:24:58.517
- Can I go?
- Yes. go.

206
00:24:59.984 --> 00:25:01.184
Very good.

207
00:25:03.704 --> 00:25:07.020
Can you hear that traffic has stopped?

208
00:25:07.124 --> 00:25:10.820
Listen to the signal.
it's going faster now.

209
00:25:10.904 --> 00:25:14.569
But don't rush. you
must be careful anyway.

210
00:25:14.864 --> 00:25:15.864
Good.

211
00:25:24.344 --> 00:25:26.253
Rita. how is the sky?

212
00:25:26.504 --> 00:25:30.510
The day is cloudy.
We can finally breathe a little.

213
00:25:30.594 --> 00:25:32.412
And what do you see?

214
00:25:32.984 --> 00:25:36.260
There is a bearded
gentleman walking a dog.

215
00:25:36.344 --> 00:25:39.311
A girl running with headphones on.

216
00:25:39.684 --> 00:25:41.411
A white van parked.

217
00:25:41.954 --> 00:25:44.772
- ...What?
- A white van parked.

218
00:25:45.067 --> 00:25:46.747
And who is inside?

219
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:50.027
- A man. it seems to me.
- A man. but...

220
00:25:50.111 --> 00:25:51.740
But. do you see his face?

221
00:25:51.824 --> 00:25:55.008
- No. I can't see behind the window.
- But. can you see the face?

222
00:25:55.092 --> 00:25:57.920
It's already leaving. maybe
they were just loading something.

223
00:25:58.004 --> 00:26:01.430
- No. Rita. let's go...
- What's going on. Diana? What is it?

224
00:26:01.514 --> 00:26:05.790
It could be the maniac.
the one from the accident.

225
00:26:06.074 --> 00:26:07.340
Let's go. please...

226
00:26:07.424 --> 00:26:10.610
Honey. you can't
live like this. in terror.

227
00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:13.330
I know exactly what you need.

228
00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:22.683
Her name is Nerea. they told
me that she is very protective.

229
00:26:24.324 --> 00:26:26.688
She jumped on the trainer.

230
00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:36.920
This type of guide you'll
always have to keep it on the left.

231
00:26:37.004 --> 00:26:39.650
And the leash on the right
with a steady hand.

232
00:26:39.734 --> 00:26:41.108
close to the body.

233
00:26:41.192 --> 00:26:43.192
- Easy... <i>
- Like that.</i>

234
00:26:44.324 --> 00:26:46.370
You will get to know each other.

235
00:26:46.454 --> 00:26:49.310
and you will grow fond of each other.

236
00:26:49.394 --> 00:26:52.710
Always feed her yourself.
OK? Only you.

237
00:26:55.034 --> 00:26:58.066
- And caress her often.
- Well done. Nerea.

238
00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:00.786
- Good.
- Come on. caress her.

239
00:27:03.404 --> 00:27:05.949
You're in good hands. Diana.

240
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.754
Chin!

241
00:27:50.025 --> 00:27:51.275
Chin!

242
00:28:03.374 --> 00:28:06.690
I brought it for you. you can keep it.

243
00:28:09.614 --> 00:28:12.290
I know. you don't know me. I...

244
00:28:12.374 --> 00:28:16.730
I was in the car that
crashed into yours that night.

245
00:28:16.814 --> 00:28:19.025
But it wasn't my fault.

246
00:28:19.784 --> 00:28:23.684
I was affected too.
a car hit me and...

247
00:28:24.434 --> 00:28:28.536
In fact... I can't see anymore.
I've gone blind.

248
00:28:31.814 --> 00:28:34.541
Do you understand my language?

249
00:28:34.904 --> 00:28:37.520
He understands. he understands...

250
00:28:37.604 --> 00:28:39.860
But has a difficult temper.

251
00:28:39.944 --> 00:28:42.980
He doesn't fraternize.
he refuses to eat.

252
00:28:43.064 --> 00:28:44.882
He makes us despair.

253
00:28:45.044 --> 00:28:48.622
Poor thing. after all
he's been through...

254
00:28:48.794 --> 00:28:53.930
Anyway. he was put on the
transfer list by the tutelary judge.

255
00:28:54.014 --> 00:28:55.820
He will be entrusted to a family...

256
00:28:55.904 --> 00:28:58.280
I don't want to go there!
I don't want to go there!

257
00:28:58.364 --> 00:29:00.691
And I don't want this anymore.

258
00:29:00.775 --> 00:29:05.390
- Go away. it's all your fault.
- Please. don't say that.

259
00:29:05.474 --> 00:29:07.292
What did I tell you?

260
00:29:07.664 --> 00:29:09.664
Come on. let's go now.

261
00:29:13.634 --> 00:29:16.358
Let's hope the mother gets better.

262
00:29:16.442 --> 00:29:18.715
So she doesn't have to...

263
00:29:19.244 --> 00:29:22.760
Look. sister. this here
is my business card.

264
00:29:22.844 --> 00:29:25.358
This is my number. my address.

265

and please call me for anything.

266
00:29:29.714 --> 00:29:32.154
- Certainly.
- Thanks you.

267
00:29:40.374 --> 00:29:41.465
It's mine!

268
00:29:41.564 --> 00:29:44.019
Fuck off!
You threw it away.

269
00:29:44.354 --> 00:29:46.070

270
00:29:46.154 --> 00:29:47.972
No. mo attack you...

00:29:52.067 --> 00:29:55.175

No!

274
00:30:07.064 --> 00:30:08.567
Enough! Stop!

Give it back now. or I'll smash
your head with my cane. clear?

276
00:30:13.148 --> 00:30:14.648
Understand?

277
00:30:19.138 --> 00:30:21.244
Good girl. let's go Nerea.

278
00:30:21.328 --> 00:30:23.588
- Thanks.
- Bye. Chin.

279
00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:11.198
Thanks. Who are you?

280
00:31:11.442 --> 00:31:12.533
It's me...

281
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.514
Chin. how did you find me?

282
00:31:19.048 --> 00:31:20.344
Your business card.

283
00:31:20.428 --> 00:31:22.774
You stole it from the nun?

284
00:31:22.858 --> 00:31:25.494
Don't send me away. please...

285
00:31:25.733 --> 00:31:28.633
You're blind. I could help you...

286
00:31:29.308 --> 00:31:32.537
I prefer to wait for my mom with you.

287
00:31:33.748 --> 00:31:35.942
It's okay. don't worry.

288
00:31:46.025 --> 00:31:48.925
Diana. Nerea is licking my hand.

289
00:31:57.508 --> 00:32:01.173
Yes. I would like to
speak to the director.

290
00:32:04.198 --> 00:32:06.425
Look. it's urgent...

291
00:32:09.868 --> 00:32:14.668
It's important. it's about the
Chinese kid who ran away.

292
00:32:15.508 --> 00:32:19.086
Excuse me. get me
the director right away.

293
00:32:32.733 --> 00:32:34.413
Chin. is that you?

294
00:32:35.983 --> 00:32:37.515
Chin?

295
00:32:38.368 --> 00:32:40.048
Is everything OK?

296
00:32:43.618 --> 00:32:45.424
- Yeah. I was calling for...
- No!

297
00:32:45.508 --> 00:32:47.923
Hang up the phone.
otherwise I'll kill myself.

298
00:32:48.007 --> 00:32:53.567
I have a knife in my throat
otherwise I'll do it. I'll kill myself!

299
00:33:00.718 --> 00:33:04.209
Did you want to kill
yourself with a pen?

300
00:33:04.888 --> 00:33:08.117
You know how to tell a good lie. huh?

301
00:33:10.108 --> 00:33:12.835
I don't want to go back there.

302
00:33:13.198 --> 00:33:17.038
Dummy... You scared me.

303
00:33:24.118 --> 00:33:26.118
Okay. Chin. come on...

304
00:33:26.458 --> 00:33:29.276
Now let's relax. and go to bed.

305
00:33:52.618 --> 00:33:53.942
Diana!

306
00:34:12.798 --> 00:34:14.478
We need money...

307
00:34:14.908 --> 00:34:18.216
I have to pay the
rent. do the shopping...

308
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.027
I have to start working again.

309
00:34:22.468 --> 00:34:25.483
Who knows if now
that I've gone blind...

310
00:34:25.567 --> 00:34:30.134
- What work do you do?
- <i>Who do you want to call?</i> Pardi.

311
00:34:30.218 --> 00:34:33.622
Public relations.
psychology sessions...

312
00:34:34.048 --> 00:34:35.224
Things like that.

313
00:34:35.308 --> 00:34:37.672
<i>Call to </i>Pardi<i> in progress.</i>

314
00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:44.884
Isn't it weird for you
now that I've gone blind?

315
00:34:44.968 --> 00:34:48.244
Matter of fact. I'm excited to
know that you can't see me.

316
00:34:48.328 --> 00:34:52.953
Because I've always considered
myself ugly. A monster.

317
00:34:53.428 --> 00:34:56.483
No. monster whoever did this to me.

318
00:35:08.834 --> 00:35:12.604
Five hundred. I'll leave
them on the nightstand.

319
00:35:12.688 --> 00:35:14.944
They are all there. trust me.

320
00:35:15.028 --> 00:35:17.483
I know you are a gentleman.

321
00:35:19.098 --> 00:35:21.996
I see that you are
organized. even got a dog.

322
00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.353
She is my guardian angel.

323
00:35:24.988 --> 00:35:26.483
Right. Nerea?

324
00:35:26.968 --> 00:35:28.386
You did good.

325
00:35:36.628 --> 00:35:37.628
Bye...

326
00:35:38.008 --> 00:35:39.688
See you soon. OK?

327
00:35:52.358 --> 00:35:56.224
Diana. for your work. do
you know what you need?

328
00:35:56.308 --> 00:35:58.608
- What work?
- What you do...

329
00:35:58.692 --> 00:36:03.056
The public... psycho...
I don't know how to say it.

330
00:36:03.688 --> 00:36:06.874
But. when I was with
my grandmother in Hong Kong.

331
00:36:06.958 --> 00:36:09.140
my cousin also did this.

332
00:36:09.388 --> 00:36:11.344
And she had a lot of money.

333
00:36:11.428 --> 00:36:13.108
And a gun.

334
00:36:16.378 --> 00:36:19.694
You are a very
intelligent child. Chin.

335
00:36:20.525 --> 00:36:23.580
But I can't see. how would I shoot?

336
00:37:10.198 --> 00:37:13.298
I see. Thank you.

337
00:37:15.938 --> 00:37:18.120
What did the doctor say?

338
00:37:18.328 --> 00:37:20.008
How is mom doing?

339
00:37:20.458 --> 00:37:21.817
Mom is...

340
00:37:22.468 --> 00:37:24.244
He didn't give me any updates...

341
00:37:24.328 --> 00:37:27.732
She's still recovering.
We have to wait.

342
00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.679
Who is that?
I'm not expecting anyone.

343
00:37:40.888 --> 00:37:43.354
Hello. Inspector Gemma Bajani.

344
00:37:43.438 --> 00:37:47.044
We are looking for a boy. he
is Chinese. and his name is Chin.

345
00:37:47.128 --> 00:37:49.384
We think he may have come here.

346
00:37:49.468 --> 00:37:51.148
Let us in. please.

347
00:37:51.628 --> 00:37:56.074
I'm in a special situation.
I recently lost my sight...

348
00:37:56.158 --> 00:37:58.384
But look. it's only a moment.

349
00:37:58.468 --> 00:38:02.133
There are no Chinese boys
in here. go away!

350
00:38:02.818 --> 00:38:06.364
Look. you went to visit
this boy at the institution.

351
00:38:06.448 --> 00:38:08.799
And the director got
a call in the middle of

352
00:38:08.883 --> 00:38:11.224
the night from a woman
who mentioned the boy.

353
00:38:11.308 --> 00:38:12.444
It wasn't me...

354
00:38:12.528 --> 00:38:16.174
The abduction of a minor is a crime that
leads to imprisonment. did you know?

355
00:38:16.258 --> 00:38:19.114
Yes. imagine what prison
can be for someone like you.

356
00:38:19.198 --> 00:38:22.874
Sorry. I don't understand.
is this an intimidation?

357
00:38:22.958 --> 00:38:24.914
I don't understand what
you want from me.

358
00:38:24.998 --> 00:38:26.791
So. it wasn't you who called to speak

359
00:38:26.875 --> 00:38:30.566
- with the director of the institute?
- No! I said no.

360
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.068
Smart! Nerea!

361
00:38:40.275 --> 00:38:41.955
Nerea. come here!

362
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:43.942
Be nice!

363
00:38:44.908 --> 00:38:45.908
Be nice.

364
00:38:53.178 --> 00:38:55.108
What the fuck were you thinking?

365
00:38:55.192 --> 00:38:58.174
You took advantage of me and
my condition. you two are scumbags.

366
00:38:58.258 --> 00:39:00.454
Shame on you. I've had enough.

367
00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:02.720
Look. we're leaving. OK?

368
00:39:02.808 --> 00:39:04.768
But if by any chance you reach the boy

369
00:39:04.852 --> 00:39:06.664
or if you remember something.

370
00:39:06.748 --> 00:39:08.466
look for me. please.

371
00:39:08.942 --> 00:39:11.909
Here. take this.
This is my number.

372
00:39:12.988 --> 00:39:19.010
I will. however. warn you that we will
be back with a warrant tonight.

373
00:39:19.228 --> 00:39:21.144
Do you realize what you've done?

374
00:39:21.228 --> 00:39:24.694
- You knew she was blind. are you mad?
- Okay. I get it. that's enough.

375
00:39:24.778 --> 00:39:28.705
- Yes. always the usual...
- At least I tried.

376
00:39:39.942 --> 00:39:42.842
- Chin. where are you?
- I'm here.

377
00:39:45.067 --> 00:39:49.504
The policewoman left you
her card. will you call her back?

378
00:39:49.588 --> 00:39:50.788
No...

379
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:54.630
Look. Chin. you can't stay here.

380
00:39:55.018 --> 00:39:57.024
They'll come back. understand?

381
00:39:57.108 --> 00:40:01.714
They'll send you to a foster home
and I'll get into serious trouble.

382
00:40:01.798 --> 00:40:04.940
Listen. do you have a place to stay?

383
00:40:05.483 --> 00:40:06.792
At my house!

384
00:40:06.983 --> 00:40:09.801
- Who's in your house?
- Nobody.

385
00:40:10.288 --> 00:40:11.968
Nobody's perfect.

386
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.483
We're almost there. come on.

387
00:40:39.344 --> 00:40:41.320
I would've liked to come with Nerea...

388
00:40:41.404 --> 00:40:45.060
Don't worry about her.
we'll see her again tomorrow.

389
00:40:45.144 --> 00:40:48.111
It was easier to come without her.

390
00:40:50.858 --> 00:40:53.942
- We're here.
- Here? - Yes.

391
00:40:55.067 --> 00:40:57.249
You don't have the keys?

392
00:41:04.234 --> 00:41:07.134
- Is it glass?
- Yes. it's glass.

393
00:42:03.624 --> 00:42:06.079
Shit. she's not picking up.

394
00:42:08.844 --> 00:42:10.753
Maybe she went out...

395
00:42:11.364 --> 00:42:14.419
- Or she is hiding inside.
- Hiding?

396
00:42:18.634 --> 00:42:20.510
It's all dark inside.

397
00:42:20.594 --> 00:42:24.850
Jerry. that doesn't mean
anything. she was here. right?

398
00:42:24.934 --> 00:42:27.180
Or maybe it's all a scene.

399
00:42:27.264 --> 00:42:29.264
So. what should we do?

400
00:42:33.194 --> 00:42:34.874
I'll call Aleardi.

401
00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:45.074
Aleardi. it's me.

402
00:42:46.194 --> 00:42:51.120
We're at the girl's place with
Jerry. but she's not there.

403
00:42:51.204 --> 00:42:52.884
What should we do?

404
00:42:57.158 --> 00:42:58.500
Bajani...

405
00:42:59.684 --> 00:43:01.067
It's a white van.

406
00:43:01.151 --> 00:43:06.233
- Yes. yes. I'll stay here...
- It's the one we're looking for!

407
00:43:06.317 --> 00:43:07.317
Jerry!

408
00:43:19.654 --> 00:43:20.854
No...

409
00:44:10.524 --> 00:44:12.920
This gentleman saw a van escape.

410
00:44:13.004 --> 00:44:14.691
Did you see what model it was?

411
00:44:14.775 --> 00:44:17.502
I wouldn't know. it was white.

412
00:44:18.434 --> 00:44:22.800
- And you didn't see anything else?
- No. I'm sorry.

413
00:44:22.884 --> 00:44:24.884
Thank you. you can go.

414
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.067
And now?

415
00:44:29.964 --> 00:44:33.542
Where did the girl and
the Chinese boy go?

416
00:44:33.834 --> 00:44:36.289
Let's check the boy's home.

417
00:44:42.944 --> 00:44:46.050
Diana. the police are
here. we need to escape.

418
00:44:46.134 --> 00:44:48.589
Quickly. come on. let's go.

419
00:44:51.983 --> 00:44:53.663
Come on. come on!

420
00:44:53.817 --> 00:44:56.453
Yes. but don't run that fast!

421
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:00.817
Out! Get out of here!

422
00:45:01.192 --> 00:45:02.608
Out!

423
00:45:03.192 --> 00:45:04.192
Out!

424
00:45:09.442 --> 00:45:12.399
Chin. the glasses. where are they?

425
00:45:12.483 --> 00:45:15.301
- I don't see them...
- Come on.

426
00:45:17.775 --> 00:45:20.817
- Where are we?
- I do not know...

427
00:45:23.392 --> 00:45:25.059
Are you OK?

428
00:45:33.858 --> 00:45:35.774
There is an exit. we are safe!

429
00:45:35.858 --> 00:45:38.614
Thank God. Chin! Hurry.

430
00:46:01.983 --> 00:46:03.283
<i>Terminal.</i>

431
00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:24.468
- Where are we?
- I do not know.

432
00:46:24.624 --> 00:46:27.442
Wait...
There's a street vendor.

433
00:46:27.894 --> 00:46:29.894
- Where is it?
- There.

434
00:46:30.114 --> 00:46:32.719
- Come on. I'll buy a new pair.
- OK.

435
00:46:32.803 --> 00:46:34.439
Let's hurry up.

436
00:46:37.957 --> 00:46:41.099
- Where is it. far away?
- It's near.

437
00:46:42.834 --> 00:46:44.514
We have arrived.

438
00:46:45.483 --> 00:46:47.224
- Here?
- Yes.

439
00:46:48.434 --> 00:46:51.480
Can you get a pair of nice.
dark glasses for me?

440
00:46:51.564 --> 00:46:52.764
Sure.

441
00:46:54.714 --> 00:46:55.914
These.

442
00:47:05.284 --> 00:47:07.694
- How do they look?
- Good.

443
00:47:08.442 --> 00:47:10.399
OK. Then. we'll buy them.

444
00:47:10.483 --> 00:47:12.233
It's 25 euros.

445
00:47:14.025 --> 00:47:16.480
- Come on. Chin.
- Let's go.

446
00:47:19.394 --> 00:47:22.649
<i>- The telephone is operational.</i>
- Who are you calling?

447
00:47:22.733 --> 00:47:26.486
<i>Say the name of the
person you want to call.</i>

448
00:47:37.874 --> 00:47:39.499
Ma'am. did I understand correctly?

449
00:47:39.583 --> 00:47:42.333
After the Casalinda farmhouse.
two kilometers on the right?

450
00:47:42.417 --> 00:47:45.364
Yes. that's right.
Thanks.

451
00:47:47.894 --> 00:47:50.771
Come on. Chin.
We have arrived.

452
00:48:09.084 --> 00:48:10.640
- Good evening.
- Evening.

453
00:48:10.724 --> 00:48:13.150
Hey! Welcome.

454
00:48:13.525 --> 00:48:14.616
Here I am.

455
00:48:14.754 --> 00:48:16.858
- Hello.
- Take my arm.

456
00:48:18.683 --> 00:48:20.182
- Hi. Chin!
- Hello.

457
00:48:20.266 --> 00:48:22.175
- How are you?
- Good.

458
00:48:24.084 --> 00:48:26.040
Thanks. Rita. you're a good friend.

459
00:48:26.124 --> 00:48:28.410
I knew I could count on you.

460
00:48:28.494 --> 00:48:30.480
- Thank you...
- But. where's the dog

461
00:48:30.564 --> 00:48:33.154
The dog stayed at home.

462
00:48:33.864 --> 00:48:37.027
- So. you don't know anything.
- No...

463
00:48:37.111 --> 00:48:38.850
Why? What's happened?

464
00:48:38.934 --> 00:48:40.410
No. nothing. Don't worry.

465
00:48:40.494 --> 00:48:43.898
Let's go home.
come on. it's right here.

466
00:48:44.654 --> 00:48:46.890
Did you know I grew up here?

467
00:48:46.974 --> 00:48:49.483
I lived with my father. alone.

468
00:48:49.567 --> 00:48:52.740
Chin. let's go to
sleep. take some rest.

469
00:48:52.824 --> 00:48:55.279
I'll prepare you some milk.

470
00:48:59.983 --> 00:49:02.619
- Have nice dreams. OK?
- Yes.

471
00:49:03.414 --> 00:49:04.414
Bye.

472
00:49:05.344 --> 00:49:07.858
- What were you telling me?
- Nothing.

473
00:49:07.942 --> 00:49:11.258
Come. grab my arm.
let's go over there.

474
00:49:16.524 --> 00:49:18.299
I couldn't speak before.

475
00:49:18.383 --> 00:49:19.958
I didn't want to scare the boy.

476
00:49:20.042 --> 00:49:21.469
Come on. talk.

477
00:49:21.804 --> 00:49:24.484
A few hours ago. in Rome.

478
00:49:25.234 --> 00:49:27.598
they killed two policemen.

479
00:49:28.067 --> 00:49:29.940
in front of your house.

480
00:49:30.024 --> 00:49:33.024
- In front of my house?
- Yeah. He did it.

481
00:49:33.108 --> 00:49:34.858
Witnesses saw it.

482
00:49:35.154 --> 00:49:38.850
They saw a white van drive
away. they said it on the news.

483
00:49:38.934 --> 00:49:41.850
Diana. you need to call
the police. Understood?

484
00:49:41.934 --> 00:49:44.760
Only the police can protect you.

485
00:49:44.844 --> 00:49:46.560
You must do it for the child.

486
00:49:46.644 --> 00:49:48.917
especially for the child!

487
00:49:49.134 --> 00:49:52.024
- I don't feel like it.
- Why not?

488
00:49:52.108 --> 00:49:53.199
Because...

489
00:49:53.874 --> 00:49:56.670
If I turn him over to the police...

490
00:49:56.754 --> 00:50:01.350
They'll put him in adoption.
or worse. in a foster home.

491
00:50:01.434 --> 00:50:05.024
I can't do this to him
after what happened.

492
00:50:05.108 --> 00:50:07.800
It was my fault. understand?
I cannot...

493
00:50:07.884 --> 00:50:10.560
Diana. you must. specially
because of what happened.

494
00:50:10.644 --> 00:50:12.816
You're putting him in danger.

495
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:13.900
Diana!

496
00:50:14.258 --> 00:50:16.440
Call the police. please.

497
00:50:16.698 --> 00:50:18.284
- It wasn't your fault.
- Yes.

498
00:50:18.368 --> 00:50:20.550
No! It was this lunatic!

499
00:50:50.488 --> 00:50:54.738
Is that you?
Is... Inspector Bajani.

500
00:50:55.538 --> 00:50:59.444
<i>I am a colleague but you can
tell me. I'm listening to you...</i>

501
00:50:59.528 --> 00:51:03.106
I am Chin. the child
you were looking for.

502
00:51:03.338 --> 00:51:06.489
I'm with Diana. the blind girl.

503
00:51:07.328 --> 00:51:09.254
<i>And where are you exactly?</i>

504
00:51:09.338 --> 00:51:13.428
In Formello. a small house
after Casalinda.

505
00:51:13.528 --> 00:51:15.214
Two kilometers to the right.

506
00:51:15.298 --> 00:51:17.388
Come. please. come.

507
00:51:17.678 --> 00:51:20.474
<i>Does the girl with you
know that you're calling?</i>

508
00:51:20.558 --> 00:51:21.558
No...

509
00:51:23.588 --> 00:51:25.668
<i>Good. Don't tell her.</i>

510
00:51:26.628 --> 00:51:29.183
<i>Bajani and I will come
immediately to pick you up.</i>

511
00:51:29.267 --> 00:51:31.038
- OK.
<i>- Don't move.</i>

512
00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.667
I have been reborn.

513
00:52:01.748 --> 00:52:02.748
Reborn...

514
00:52:03.548 --> 00:52:06.798
Well? Come on. I'll help you.

515
00:52:08.918 --> 00:52:11.009
Did you think about it?

516
00:52:11.108 --> 00:52:14.163
- Are you calling the police?
- Yes.

517
00:52:16.348 --> 00:52:18.858
But I want to talk to
Chin first. understand?

518
00:52:18.942 --> 00:52:22.108
I don't want to do
this behind his back.

519
00:52:22.192 --> 00:52:24.954
You'll see. he will understand.

520
00:52:25.038 --> 00:52:27.402
I don't know if he will...

521
00:52:31.538 --> 00:52:32.817
Hello?

522
00:52:34.448 --> 00:52:36.275
Who is it?

523
00:52:37.148 --> 00:52:39.512
But. when did this happen?

524
00:52:40.028 --> 00:52:43.184
Okay. yes. yes. I'll be
right there. five minutes.

525
00:52:43.268 --> 00:52:45.794
- Who was it?
- A gentleman I work for.

526
00:52:45.878 --> 00:52:48.733
He lives nearby. he fell
and got hurt. he is alone.

527
00:52:48.817 --> 00:52:51.294
I have to go help him.
I'll be right back. okay?

528
00:52:51.378 --> 00:52:53.058
Here's your cane.

529
00:52:53.678 --> 00:52:55.444
- Will you come back?
- Yes!

530
00:52:55.528 --> 00:52:57.437
I will be right back.

531
00:54:12.678 --> 00:54:14.678
<i>- Hello?</i>
- He's coming!

532
00:54:14.908 --> 00:54:17.442
<i>- Run away!</i>
- Oh God. Chin!

533
00:54:17.525 --> 00:54:19.252
I'm here. I'm here!

534
00:54:19.338 --> 00:54:23.191
Chin. hurry up. take
your jacket. we have to escape!

535
00:54:23.275 --> 00:54:24.567
The shoes!

536
00:54:26.608 --> 00:54:27.608
Hurry up!

537
00:54:57.548 --> 00:54:59.548
Wait. Chin! Wait up...

538
00:55:01.478 --> 00:55:04.454
- What do you see over there?
- The street.

539
00:55:04.538 --> 00:55:08.216
- There? What's over there?
- The forest. we can go in there.

540
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.700
Let's go!

541
00:55:10.688 --> 00:55:12.524
But how will we do it?

542
00:55:12.608 --> 00:55:16.186
- There is a path!
- In the forest? - Yes.

543
00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:41.275
Help! Help!

544
00:55:41.883 --> 00:55:42.883

Help.

547
00:56:17.798 --> 00:56:19.574
Did you hear that too?

548
00:56:19.658 --> 00:56:21.858
- Yes. hurry!
- Wait!

549
00:56:22.298 --> 00:56:23.298
Wait...

550
00:56:23.678 --> 00:56:25.524
- What is it?
- The cellphone.

551
00:56:25.608 --> 00:56:28.338
Fuck... The cellphone.

552
00:56:29.228 --> 00:56:32.672
- I left it at home.
- It doesn't matter.

553
00:56:32.756 --> 00:56:36.274
- I forgot it at home.
- It's okay. let's go!

554
00:56:36.358 --> 00:56:37.994
Wait. please...

555
00:56:38.683 --> 00:56:40.774
Let's catch our breath.

556
00:56:42.483 --> 00:56:45.525
Wait... Please.

557
00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:49.018
Diana... Hold still...

558
00:56:50.917 --> 00:56:52.217
Why?

559
00:56:55.658 --> 00:56:57.338
There is a body.

560
00:56:57.968 --> 00:56:59.168
Chin...

561
00:57:00.698 --> 00:57:01.898
Chin!

562
00:57:02.888 --> 00:57:04.649
Chin. what's going on?

563
00:57:04.733 --> 00:57:06.150
It's Rita!

564
00:57:06.418 --> 00:57:08.904
- Where is it?!
- On the ground. she's not moving!

565
00:57:08.988 --> 00:57:10.192
What?!

566
00:57:12.233 --> 00:57:14.506
Chin. come help me. Chin!

567
00:57:15.383 --> 00:57:16.910
Where are you?

568
00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:26.942
Rita!

569
00:57:34.928 --> 00:57:36.228
Rita...

570
00:57:38.867 --> 00:57:40.167
Rita...

571
00:58:00.608 --> 00:58:02.918
Mom. I want my mom!

572
00:58:06.433 --> 00:58:07.833
Chin...

573
00:58:10.025 --> 00:58:12.514
Come. I have to tell you something...

574
00:58:12.598 --> 00:58:13.800
What?

575
00:58:17.288 --> 00:58:19.106
Chin. your mother...

576
00:58:21.128 --> 00:58:23.128
Your mother is dead...

577
00:58:25.238 --> 00:58:26.238
No.

578
00:58:27.008 --> 00:58:29.553
That's not true. it's a lie!

579
00:58:29.708 --> 00:58:32.778
I don't believe it. you are mean.

580
00:58:33.908 --> 00:58:35.638
Mom is not dead.

581
00:58:36.068 --> 00:58:40.064
Chin. the doctor told me.
when I called the hospital.

582
00:58:40.148 --> 00:58:44.861
I'm sorry. I should have
told you earlier. I'm sorry...

583
00:58:45.578 --> 00:58:46.669
However...

584
00:58:48.118 --> 00:58:50.804
You have to think about this...

585
00:58:50.888 --> 00:58:52.754
Like a bad dream. understand?

586
00:58:52.838 --> 00:58:57.434
That when you wake up. you
understand that it is not real...

587
00:58:57.518 --> 00:58:59.700
That it doesn't exist...

588
00:59:00.428 --> 00:59:01.900
Come here.

589
00:59:05.498 --> 00:59:08.134
Calm down. I'm here with you.

590
00:59:54.608 --> 00:59:55.983
I see water!

591
00:59:59.275 --> 01:00:02.853
Let's go. come on.
So he loses our tracks.

592
01:00:06.525 --> 01:00:09.754
Diana. there's tall-grass over there.

593
01:00:10.275 --> 01:00:13.330
Is it a lot?
I mean. are they dense?

594
01:00:13.483 --> 01:00:17.498
- Yeah.
- Then let's go over there. let's hide.

595
01:00:46.692 --> 01:00:49.147
- There's something!
- What?

596
01:00:50.358 --> 01:00:51.716
What is that?!

597
01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.280
It's a snake!

598
01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:55.897
Snakes!
Snakes in the water!

599
01:00:56.483 --> 01:00:59.383
My arm! My arm!
It's a snake den!

600
01:01:00.358 --> 01:01:02.108
They bit me too!

601
01:01:05.775 --> 01:01:06.775
I got it!

602
01:01:25.733 --> 01:01:26.733
Diana!

603
01:02:16.067 --> 01:02:20.358
Let's get out of here!
Let's run! We have to hide.

604
01:02:21.067 --> 01:02:23.794
- Guide me... Guide me.
- Come!

605
01:02:24.428 --> 01:02:25.628
Come!

606
01:02:28.798 --> 01:02:30.108
I see a light.

607
01:02:30.192 --> 01:02:32.919
- It's a car.
- There's a road!

608
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.524
- Chin. let's go out there.
- Let's go

609
01:02:37.608 --> 01:02:41.692
- If you see a white van. tell me.
- OK. yes.

610
01:02:49.718 --> 01:02:51.775
I hear a noise. Chin.

611
01:02:55.233 --> 01:02:56.983
Headlights... It's a car!

612
01:02:57.067 --> 01:02:59.567
- Is it a white van?
- No!

613
01:02:59.858 --> 01:03:02.222
- What color is it?
- Dark.

614
01:03:03.858 --> 01:03:04.858
Stop!

615
01:03:05.317 --> 01:03:06.692
Stop! Stop!

616
01:03:11.748 --> 01:03:14.191
Are you are crazy?!
We were about to run you over.

617
01:03:14.275 --> 01:03:16.943
Please help us. I am blind.

618
01:03:18.098 --> 01:03:20.734
And there's a lunatic here...

619
01:03:20.948 --> 01:03:22.649
He is chasing us...

620
01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:25.483
- Where? What happened?
- We're running away.

621
01:03:25.567 --> 01:03:28.748
- Help us. please.
- You're all wet.

622
01:03:28.788 --> 01:03:30.879
I have blankets inside.

623
01:03:36.288 --> 01:03:38.444
We can take you up to the village.

624
01:03:38.528 --> 01:03:39.844
Don't be afraid.

625
01:03:39.928 --> 01:03:42.434
- Thank you...
- Let's go to the carabinieri.

626
01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:44.634
In the car I have a
thermos with coffee.

627
01:03:44.718 --> 01:03:48.633
- It's hot. do you want some?
- Yes. thank you.

628
01:04:22.483 --> 01:04:26.323
There's the white van!
There's the white van!

629
01:04:31.658 --> 01:04:34.316
There's a shotgun on the ground...

630
01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:35.927
Give it to me.

631
01:04:45.775 --> 01:04:48.400
Here. over here. like this.

632
01:04:53.108 --> 01:04:55.067
Get it right. Here?

633
01:04:55.688 --> 01:05:00.226
What the fuck do you want?
What do you want from me?!

634
01:05:00.728 --> 01:05:03.191
- Did I get him?
- No! You didn't get him.

635
01:05:03.275 --> 01:05:05.093
Where? Aim it right.

636
01:05:08.048 --> 01:05:10.649
- Did I get him?
- No! You didn't get him.

637
01:05:10.733 --> 01:05:12.983
Fuck you... Fuck you!

638
01:06:03.398 --> 01:06:05.314
Do you hear the river?

639
01:06:05.398 --> 01:06:08.298
I'm going to see where it leads.

640
01:06:39.483 --> 01:06:40.883
Chin?

641
01:06:43.838 --> 01:06:44.838
Chin.

642
01:06:47.408 --> 01:06:49.088
Chin. answer me.

643
01:06:51.628 --> 01:06:53.028
Chin.

644
01:06:54.668 --> 01:06:56.486
Chin. where are you?

645
01:07:13.317 --> 01:07:15.226
Chin. where are you?!

646
01:07:25.175 --> 01:07:26.702
Where are you?

647
01:09:32.342 --> 01:09:33.342
Help!

648
01:09:35.417 --> 01:09:38.317
Help! Help!

649
01:09:59.192 --> 01:10:00.883
Is anyone there?

650
01:10:15.775 --> 01:10:17.775
Chin?

651
01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.180
Is anybody there?

652
01:10:42.725 --> 01:10:44.452
Is anyone in here?!

653
01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.673
Who is it? Who is there?!

654
01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:48.112
- Who is there?!
- It's Chin.

655
01:11:50.328 --> 01:11:51.728
Chin...

656
01:11:51.978 --> 01:11:53.442
Yes. it's me.

657
01:11:53.775 --> 01:11:57.179
Diana! I was afraid
I couldn't find you.

658
01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:59.244
Where have you been?!

659
01:11:59.328 --> 01:12:04.014
- Where have you been?
- I fell down. looking for the river.

660
01:12:04.098 --> 01:12:05.516
Are you hurt?

661
01:12:06.138 --> 01:12:07.692
A little.

662
01:12:13.768 --> 01:12:16.008
Chin... Where are we?

663
01:12:18.408 --> 01:12:22.597
There are some strange machines.
I do not know...

664
01:12:27.317 --> 01:12:29.317
Chin. what do you see?

665
01:12:31.608 --> 01:12:35.012
There is something written on the wall.

666
01:12:36.258 --> 01:12:40.709
- ''Dam system.''
- It must be the guardian's house.

667
01:12:41.948 --> 01:12:44.940
- I hear footsteps.
- I hear them too.

668
01:12:45.024 --> 01:12:46.751
Is it the guardian?

669
01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:50.543
Why do you say that?
Do you see him?

670
01:12:51.088 --> 01:12:52.997
Why isn't he talking?

671
01:12:53.768 --> 01:12:55.233
Why isn't he talking?!

672
01:12:55.317 --> 01:12:56.953
I don't know...

673
01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.200
I know this smell...

674
01:12:59.248 --> 01:13:00.928
I recognize him.

675
01:13:01.818 --> 01:13:04.024
You are Matteo. the dog breeder!

676
01:13:04.108 --> 01:13:06.525
Escape! Run away. Chin!

677
01:13:07.548 --> 01:13:09.858
Well done. Diana. it's
me. the one that stinks.

678
01:13:09.942 --> 01:13:11.669
Leave me. Leave me!

679
01:13:12.525 --> 01:13:14.692
Leave me! Go away.

680
01:13:15.108 --> 01:13:16.525
Help.

681
01:13:16.983 --> 01:13:17.983
Help.

682
01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:23.775
You're crazy! Psychopath.
you are crazy!

683
01:13:24.498 --> 01:13:26.691
What do you want from me?
What do you want?

684
01:13:26.775 --> 01:13:28.467
Let the boy go!

685
01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:34.233
- I'm afraid. what does he want from us?
- Chin. I'm sorry. it's my fault...

686
01:13:34.317 --> 01:13:36.953
It's my fault. Chin. sorry...

687
01:13:39.483 --> 01:13:41.025
Sorry. Chin...

688
01:14:06.348 --> 01:14:08.598
Well? How was the trip?

689
01:14:10.878 --> 01:14:12.884
You are far from civilization.

690
01:14:12.968 --> 01:14:15.786
There is no point in yelling...

691
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:21.150
What did I do to you?!

692
01:14:21.483 --> 01:14:23.483
What did I do to you?!

693
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.309
What did I do to you?

694
01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:33.594
Fucking bitch.

695
01:14:34.788 --> 01:14:36.744
You wanted to humiliate me that day.

696
01:14:36.828 --> 01:14:39.399
I stank. huh?
Now you'll take the shower!

697
01:14:39.483 --> 01:14:41.650
Crazy! You are crazy!

698
01:14:43.068 --> 01:14:44.704
Don't say that.

699
01:14:45.288 --> 01:14:46.398
Bitch!

700
01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:48.108
Help!

701
01:14:48.983 --> 01:14:51.275
Help us!

702
01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:06.342
Leave me!

703

Help us!

704
01:15:26.025 --> 01:15:27.705
Enough! Help us!

705
01:15:44.025 --> 01:15:45.608
It's Nerea!

706
01:15:48.533 --> 01:15:51.433
- Chin. really?
- Yes. it's Nerea!

707
01:15:51.775 --> 01:15:53.455
<i>Stay! Nerea. stay.</i>

708
01:15:54.348 --> 01:15:56.064
I got her from your house.

709
01:15:56.148 --> 01:15:58.366
These trained dogs
are worth a lot of money.

710
01:15:58.450 --> 01:15:59.830
Nerea! Come here!

711
01:15:59.983 --> 01:16:02.275
<i>Stay!</i> Good dog.

712
01:16:03.168 --> 01:16:04.848
See how dogs work?

713
01:16:04.938 --> 01:16:06.604
You'll do the same. now.

714
01:16:06.688 --> 01:16:08.779
And then I'll kill you.

715
01:16:10.368 --> 01:16:11.692
Nerea!

716
01:16:13.548 --> 01:16:15.649
- Good...
- Nerea. attack!

717
01:16:15.733 --> 01:16:17.025
Shut up!

718
01:16:17.508 --> 01:16:19.872
- You whore!
- Tear him up!

719
01:16:20.317 --> 01:16:23.358
<i>- Sit!</i>
- Attack Nerea!

720
01:16:23.692 --> 01:16:25.525
Kill him! Kill him!

721
01:16:26.067 --> 01:16:27.794
Now. Nerea! Attack!

722
01:16:28.098 --> 01:16:29.098
Attack!

723
01:16:51.192 --> 01:16:52.919
Don't look. Chin...

724
01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:54.610
It's awful...

725
01:16:54.775 --> 01:16:56.502
She is saving us...

726
01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:02.527
We are safe.

727
01:18:20.098 --> 01:18:21.398
Stop here.

728
01:18:21.508 --> 01:18:23.690
Can you open it. please?

729
01:18:30.078 --> 01:18:32.533
What a disgusting criminal.

730
01:18:33.452 --> 01:18:35.907
But torn apart like this...

731
01:18:36.258 --> 01:18:38.258
What a terrible death.

732
01:18:43.998 --> 01:18:45.307
Cover it up.

733
01:19:38.038 --> 01:19:41.267
My cousin is here.
The relations girl.

734
01:19:41.418 --> 01:19:43.704
Public relations. the psychologist.

735
01:19:43.788 --> 01:19:46.243
Yeah. the one with the gun.

736
01:19:48.888 --> 01:19:51.343
Then. you're in good hands.

737
01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:02.518
- This is Diana.
- Hello.

738
01:20:07.768 --> 01:20:08.868
Thanks.

739
01:20:12.318 --> 01:20:15.558
The custody papers are cleared. so...

740
01:20:16.968 --> 01:20:19.513
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.

741
01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.448
Bye. Nerea.

742
01:20:23.442 --> 01:20:24.650
Bye. Diana.

743
01:20:28.248 --> 01:20:29.775
I'll miss you.

744
01:20:41.108 --> 01:20:42.308
Bye. Diana!

745
01:20:42.608 --> 01:20:44.884
Bye. Chin. say hello
to Hong Kong for me.

746
01:20:44.968 --> 01:20:47.514
I'll wait for you. come and see me.

747
01:20:47.598 --> 01:20:48.817
I promise.

748
01:20:54.378 --> 01:20:57.744
We can give you a
lift if you want. Diana.

749
01:20:57.828 --> 01:20:59.754
- No. thanks.
- Are you sure?

750
01:20:59.838 --> 01:21:01.474
Yes. thank you.

751
01:21:01.728 --> 01:21:04.483
- See you around.
- Bye.

752
01:21:22.458 --> 01:21:26.623
Nerea. you are the
only friend I have left.
