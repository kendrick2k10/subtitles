3
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:18.459
Fuck!

4
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:36.128
Hey! Hey!

5
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:07.638
System's armed.

6
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.163
Home secured.

7
00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:13.122
Welcome home. Mary.

8
00:04:17.996 --> 00:04:19.911
Mary!

9
00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:21.957
Jiao. what can I do for you?

10
00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:25.352
One of your construction trucks
drove over my flowerbed.

11
00:04:25.482 --> 00:04:28.137
Again! My hydrangeas are ruined.

12
00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:30.139
It's been six months of this!

13
00:04:30.835 --> 00:04:32.184
It won't happen again.

14
00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:33.882
There won't be any more trucks.

15
00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:36.406
I promise. They're done.

16
00:04:36.537 --> 00:04:37.973
And slow down!

17
00:04:38.234 --> 00:04:40.802
You drive like a crazy person.

18
00:04:40.932 --> 00:04:41.846
Goodbye. Jiao!

19
00:04:55.077 --> 00:04:58.385
This Diablo Killer has a type
when it comes to these murders.

20
00:04:58.472 --> 00:05:00.430
Always female. always brunette.

21
00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:02.389
similar heights and facial features.

22
00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:07.350
He tends to relocate to a new state

23
00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:08.830
after three victims.

24
00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.181
Please. do not go into the forest alone.

25
00:05:25.237 --> 00:05:26.935
I got it.
- All right.

26
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:29.546
Keep your eyes closed.

27
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.202
Keep '‘em closed. wait for it.

28
00:05:34.072 --> 00:05:35.509
Open your eyes. Kelly.

29
00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:39.600
Whoa!

30
00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:41.906
Amazing. huh?
The blueprints.

31
00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:43.952
the floor plans. the smart home tech.

32
00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:47.303
all developed by this beautiful
young genius right here.

33
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:50.393
Wait. young? Are you young. mom?

34
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.221
Don't you start. you little shit!

35
00:05:52.308 --> 00:05:54.832
What's that?

36
00:05:56.965 --> 00:05:58.401
That's nice!

37
00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:03.841
"Welcome to the neighborhood.
Jiao". Who's Jiao?

38
00:06:03.972 --> 00:06:05.539
Jiao. She lives
in the property over.

39
00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:07.628
She did tell me. though. our tree branches

40
00:06:07.758 --> 00:06:10.805
were hanging into her yard.
so I think we have a complainer.

41
00:06:10.892 --> 00:06:12.459
Well. I'll get her
a thank you note right away.

42
00:06:12.546 --> 00:06:14.156
so she doesn't complain about that.

43
00:06:14.286 --> 00:06:16.898
Kel. would you help us
getting the door for us?

44
00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:19.204
Just gotta put your hand up
to the panel there.

45
00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:25.689
System unarmed.

46
00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:29.476
Cool! SECURITY SYSTEM:
Welcome home. Kelly.

47
00:06:29.563 --> 00:06:30.868
Are you guys seeing this?

48
00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:33.131
Mm-hmm. just go in.

49
00:06:37.962 --> 00:06:40.443
We're home.

50
00:06:43.838 --> 00:06:47.058
I used my engineering know-how
to build a one-of-a-kind.

51
00:06:47.145 --> 00:06:49.365
state-of-the art smart home.

52
00:06:49.626 --> 00:06:53.891
The foundation is all original.
but everything else is new.

53
00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:57.895
Okay. so the app. I developed it
from the ground up. all right?

54
00:06:57.982 --> 00:07:00.376
And. uh. you can work this
on your phone as well.

55
00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:01.551
All right? So. uh...

56
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:04.032
All right. watch this.

57
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.426
Lights on. Ta-da!

58
00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:07.992
Wow! Yeah.

59
00:07:08.123 --> 00:07:09.254
Watch this.

60
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.955
Windows opaque.

61
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.654
Mm-hmm. You can also start
the dishwasher. the oven.

62
00:07:17.785 --> 00:07:19.569
the laundry. I mean. you can even...

63
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.484
you can even see what's inside the fridge.

64
00:07:21.615 --> 00:07:23.747
Holy crap. Mom! MARY: Right?

65
00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:26.358
Oh. and there's the central air
temperature sliders.

66
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.969
if you're too hot. you're too cold.

67
00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:29.840
you can just make yourself comfortable.

68
00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:31.799
Yeah. but don't touch the thermostat.

69
00:07:32.495 --> 00:07:33.670
Did I say that out loud?

70
00:07:33.757 --> 00:07:35.629
I'm sorry. It's a dad's reflex.

71
00:07:35.716 --> 00:07:38.066
Oh. and there are no cameras
in the bathroom.

72
00:07:38.153 --> 00:07:39.067
as promised.

73
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:40.938
Mm. that was gonna be my next question.

74
00:07:41.025 --> 00:07:42.766
Kel. you have to see this.

75
00:07:42.853 --> 00:07:44.812
You missed it on the way in.

76
00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:46.988
This is my favorite.
Your mother's a genius.

77
00:07:47.118 --> 00:07:48.206
Thank you.

78
00:07:51.383 --> 00:07:53.124
It goes up from the basement to here.

79
00:07:53.255 --> 00:07:54.952
It goes up. stops right outside your room.

80
00:07:55.039 --> 00:07:57.085
You built an elevator because of my knee?

81
00:07:57.172 --> 00:07:58.478
Honey. no. it's not like that. it...

82
00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:00.784
I... I told you I didn't want
any special treatment!

83
00:08:00.915 --> 00:08:03.831
Kel. we had to build the place
for accessibility.

84
00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:05.789
I'm capable of taking the stairs.

85
00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:07.922
Right. and nobody said otherwise.

86
00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:09.314
No. we're all gonna use it.

87
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:12.056
And if my office is upstairs
then the clients.

88
00:08:12.143 --> 00:08:14.145
they won't have to traipse
through the whole house.

89
00:08:14.232 --> 00:08:17.235
but come on.
it'’s gonna make things easier.Yeah.

90
00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:20.151
You know. we talked
about the surgery option.

91
00:08:20.587 --> 00:08:22.850
Right? And you know what?

92
00:08:23.633 --> 00:08:25.330
You don't have to use it
if you don't want to.

93
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.378
Can I call it from my phone?

94
00:08:29.465 --> 00:08:31.598
Of course you can.

95
00:08:57.362 --> 00:08:58.494
Okay.

96
00:12:34.318 --> 00:12:37.539
It was a moniker coined
by the media in 2015.

97
00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.367
"The Diablo Killer."

98
00:12:39.454 --> 00:12:43.153
The origin of the name?
A single word carved into a tree

99
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.982
near what police believe
was the original crime scene.

100
00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:48.202
a cabin in rural Oregon

101
00:12:48.289 --> 00:12:50.857
containing the remains
of his first victim.

102
00:12:51.118 --> 00:12:52.772
a still unidentified woman.

103
00:12:53.642 --> 00:12:54.686
The corpse.

104
00:12:54.904 --> 00:12:56.558
charred beyond recognition.

105
00:12:56.688 --> 00:12:59.909
with her severed tongue
preserved in a jar.

106
00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:02.999
Exactly like your father!

107
00:13:04.566 --> 00:13:05.741
Diablo!

108
00:13:05.959 --> 00:13:09.049
It took one FBI agent years
to connect the dots.

109
00:13:09.136 --> 00:13:12.052
A leaked profile indicated
that he may have been working

110
00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:15.055
as a laborer in the areas
of each of the killings.

111
00:13:15.229 --> 00:13:18.885
This Diablo Killer has a type
when it comes to these murders.

112
00:13:19.102 --> 00:13:21.278
Always female. always brunette.

113
00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:23.672
similar heights and facial features.

114
00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:25.456
He tends to relocate to a new state

115
00:13:25.543 --> 00:13:26.762
after three victims.

116
00:13:28.068 --> 00:13:29.460
Oh. you fuck!

117
00:13:53.484 --> 00:13:55.051
You were using a stolen ID.

118
00:14:02.102 --> 00:14:04.408
They had you and they didn't even know it.

119
00:14:12.416 --> 00:14:14.897
That's right. it's you and me now.

120
00:14:20.903 --> 00:14:22.209
You know what to do.

121
00:14:27.475 --> 00:14:28.650
Find the key...

122
00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:33.350
Take the fucking key.

123
00:14:36.136 --> 00:14:37.572
Come on. take it.

124
00:15:16.132 --> 00:15:17.525
Exactly like your father!

125
00:15:20.832 --> 00:15:23.096
Pray to get rid of the Devil!

126
00:15:30.146 --> 00:15:31.321
Investigators believe

127
00:15:31.756 --> 00:15:34.803
that he kept the victims alive
for an unknown length of time.

128
00:15:42.158 --> 00:15:43.812
Perhaps most sickening.

129
00:15:44.117 --> 00:15:46.815
forensics concluded
that their tongues were severed

130
00:15:46.902 --> 00:15:48.599
while the young women were still alive.

131
00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:57.173
That's right. you son of a bitch...

132
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.448
Where did you bury them?

133
00:16:21.676 --> 00:16:23.460
Un pequeño diablo...

134
00:16:30.554 --> 00:16:34.384
Diablo!

135
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:57.407
You speak vile words. Devil!

136
00:16:57.494 --> 00:17:00.019
That's who you are. the son of the Devil.

137
00:17:00.106 --> 00:17:01.542
exactly like your father!

138
00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:11.465
What are you doing?

139
00:17:26.436 --> 00:17:27.742
Yeah. I see you.

140
00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.102
Oh. no! You fucking don't!

141
00:17:56.423 --> 00:17:58.425
I'm here at the house of Benita Caccio.

142
00:17:58.555 --> 00:18:01.123
the sister
of one of the victims. Benita.

143
00:18:02.255 --> 00:18:03.908
is there anything you'd like to say

144
00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:05.171
to Diablo if you could?

145
00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:07.086
Someday.

146
00:18:07.738 --> 00:18:09.000
someone will find you...

147
00:18:11.046 --> 00:18:12.743
and they're going to make you pay.

148
00:18:47.822 --> 00:18:49.693
Is this what I think it is?

149
00:18:49.824 --> 00:18:52.392
If you think it's yours. then yes. it is!

150
00:18:56.961 --> 00:18:58.485
Happy birthday. my darling.

151
00:18:58.572 --> 00:19:00.008
Oh. my God!

152
00:19:00.095 --> 00:19:02.141
Like it? KELLY: I love it.

153
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:08.712
So.

154
00:19:09.887 --> 00:19:11.933
you're a candidate for surgery.

155
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.196
and yeah. it's experimental.

156
00:19:14.327 --> 00:19:16.807
but the specialist is the very best.

157
00:19:16.894 --> 00:19:18.157
I love you guys!

158
00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:19.680
I love you so much.

159
00:19:46.576 --> 00:19:50.014
Exactly like your father!

160
00:19:51.668 --> 00:19:53.714
Eres un diablo.

161
00:19:53.844 --> 00:19:57.196
Diablo!

162
00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:17.781
He was experimenting
with paralytic agents.

163
00:20:17.955 --> 00:20:19.566
but he didn't know which ones to use

164
00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:20.958
or the proper dosage.

165
00:20:21.045 --> 00:20:23.744
As a result. his first victim in Colorado.

166
00:20:23.831 --> 00:20:26.616
Darlene Horan. survived the attack.

167
00:20:29.663 --> 00:20:30.664
Come on. come on.

168
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:32.883
Move. move!

169
00:20:41.152 --> 00:20:42.110
Fuck!

170
00:21:17.014 --> 00:21:18.973
You didn't let them off that easy.

171
00:21:19.321 --> 00:21:20.583
so neither will I.

172
00:21:35.685 --> 00:21:38.384
A side effect
from the paralytic agent was blindness.

173
00:21:38.862 --> 00:21:40.995
Darlene burned herself on steam pipes

174
00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:43.389
feeling her way
through the corridors on her escape.

175
00:21:44.346 --> 00:21:45.739
She survived long enough

176
00:21:45.826 --> 00:21:47.262
to scribble in a makeshift journal

177
00:21:47.393 --> 00:21:49.569
and say her captor did not speak.

178
00:21:52.702 --> 00:21:55.139
The second victim.
Mickayla Mayer. was found

179
00:21:55.226 --> 00:21:57.620
with her tongue cut out
and her lingual artery.

180
00:21:58.839 --> 00:22:01.189
She was discovered
in an abandoned paper mill

181
00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:03.670
weeks after her disappearance.
burned alive.

182
00:22:07.978 --> 00:22:09.763
Unlike Darlene. there were no clues

183
00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.504
that were left behind by Mickayla.

184
00:22:12.026 --> 00:22:14.071
Authorities believe she was murdered there

185
00:22:14.158 --> 00:22:15.290
and left for dead.

186
00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:19.903
The third victim. Ashley Ko.

187
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.297
was found mutilated and also burned alive.

188
00:22:40.576 --> 00:22:42.361
Darlene lived for several weeks

189
00:22:42.448 --> 00:22:44.363
and scribbled in a makeshift journal.

190
00:22:45.015 --> 00:22:46.147
She lived.

191
00:22:49.803 --> 00:22:51.195
And then. she died.

192
00:22:55.025 --> 00:22:57.071
Why won't you speak?

193
00:23:01.902 --> 00:23:03.860
Why won't you speak?

194
00:23:04.426 --> 00:23:05.993
Un diablo!

195
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.386
Exactly like your father!

196
00:23:07.516 --> 00:23:11.781
Diablo!

197
00:23:14.131 --> 00:23:15.655
Why won't you speak?

198
00:23:22.705 --> 00:23:24.098
Fucking speak!

199
00:23:52.605 --> 00:23:54.215
Fry. motherfucker.

200
00:24:15.105 --> 00:24:16.150
Move!

201
00:24:20.807 --> 00:24:21.938
Move!

202
00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.210
Move!

203
00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:36.475
Move!

204
00:25:02.762 --> 00:25:04.590
You recognize them. asshole?

205
00:25:10.944 --> 00:25:13.990
You tortured them all
before burning them alive.

206
00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.130
I guess you see how this works now.

207
00:25:36.665 --> 00:25:38.493
You paralyzed these women.

208
00:25:39.407 --> 00:25:41.714
Do you know what it's like to be frozen

209
00:25:41.801 --> 00:25:43.542
while someone tortures you?

210
00:25:52.899 --> 00:25:54.378
Exactly like your father!

211
00:26:48.215 --> 00:26:49.129
Mary!

212
00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:50.652
I got your mail

213
00:26:51.087 --> 00:26:52.219
by mistake!

214
00:26:55.004 --> 00:26:56.136
No time to talk.

215
00:26:56.223 --> 00:26:57.528
Please. leave it in the mailbox.

216
00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.443
Well. it looks important.

217
00:26:59.792 --> 00:27:00.836
Priority!

218
00:27:05.232 --> 00:27:06.799
Please leave. Jiao.

219
00:27:29.343 --> 00:27:30.387
Mary!

220
00:27:30.823 --> 00:27:32.476
Jiao. you need to leave.

221
00:27:32.607 --> 00:27:34.435
You need to start respecting my privacy.

222
00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:37.003
I... I can't hear you!

223
00:27:37.394 --> 00:27:39.266
Uh. the video is broken.

224
00:27:39.396 --> 00:27:41.529
Uh. come out and talk!

225
00:27:41.703 --> 00:27:43.270
Jiao. you need to leave right now.

226
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.880
This is not okay.

227
00:27:45.272 --> 00:27:47.013
You've been acting very strange.

228
00:27:47.274 --> 00:27:50.146
Workers coming and going?
At all hours?

229
00:27:50.494 --> 00:27:51.626
What are you doing?

230
00:27:55.456 --> 00:27:56.849
I should call the police.

231
00:27:56.936 --> 00:27:58.024
All right. we both know

232
00:27:58.154 --> 00:28:00.069
that the police don't believe you anymore.

233
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:03.159
All right?

234
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.335
And quit taking my mail!

235
00:28:17.608 --> 00:28:18.784
Don't come back.

236
00:28:39.892 --> 00:28:40.936
Good riddance!

237
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.852
Kelly. what are you doing?

238
00:28:44.331 --> 00:28:46.289
You saw the surgery results.
I don't need them anymore.

239
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:47.900
Kel. the pool?

240
00:28:48.814 --> 00:28:52.165
But you do need rehab
and to let your body heal.

241
00:28:52.252 --> 00:28:53.819
You can't protect me forever.

242
00:28:54.471 --> 00:28:57.039
Uh. maybe not.
but I'm not gonna stop trying.

243
00:28:57.126 --> 00:28:58.519
Mom. I'm an adult now!

244
00:28:58.693 --> 00:29:00.216
You don't need to watch me like a hawk!

245
00:29:00.564 --> 00:29:01.957
Three years here
and I can'’t even sneak out

246
00:29:02.044 --> 00:29:03.306
like a normal teenager.

247
00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:04.612
Okay. Kel. First of all.

248
00:29:04.699 --> 00:29:06.266
I have never spied on you.

249
00:29:06.353 --> 00:29:08.747
And since when do you want to sneak out?

250
00:29:08.834 --> 00:29:11.488
Maybe we should let her
have her moment of triumph.

251
00:29:11.924 --> 00:29:13.534
Look. I'm fine! See?

252
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:14.927
Okay. just...

253
00:29:15.928 --> 00:29:17.843
I'm gonna drive up to the park
and walk the trails.

254
00:29:18.321 --> 00:29:19.409
Don't wait up.

255
00:29:23.109 --> 00:29:24.850
She just needs to do this for herself.

256
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.093
Agent Wall.
why did you transfer to New York?

257
00:29:51.746 --> 00:29:53.052
There was an attempted abduction

258
00:29:53.139 --> 00:29:54.662
this year outside of Albany

259
00:29:54.749 --> 00:29:56.577
that fits his MO which led me to believe

260
00:29:56.664 --> 00:29:58.100
he'd relocate to the region.

261
00:29:58.231 --> 00:30:01.190
Now I've worked the Diablo case
for years in California

262
00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:02.975
so I've seen things slip through the crack

263
00:30:03.105 --> 00:30:04.585
when investigations change hands.

264
00:30:04.672 --> 00:30:06.152
and I wanted to stay close to him.

265
00:30:06.456 --> 00:30:08.023
What happened here?

266
00:30:08.589 --> 00:30:09.590
Selena?

267
00:30:13.028 --> 00:30:14.116
Oh. my God!

268
00:30:15.117 --> 00:30:16.162
Oh. my God!

269
00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.078
Let go of me!

270
00:30:20.514 --> 00:30:22.516
No!

271
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.694
Not my child!

272
00:30:26.781 --> 00:30:28.348
Not my...

273
00:30:31.525 --> 00:30:33.440
My baby! My baby!

274
00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:37.009
And finally. can you tell us

275
00:30:37.139 --> 00:30:39.359
why does he remove their tongues?

276
00:30:42.014 --> 00:30:43.363
How do you know it's her?

277
00:30:43.624 --> 00:30:45.756
They found her belongings nearby.

278
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.759
Including a specialized knee brace.

279
00:30:49.108 --> 00:30:50.936
And a partial match for dental records

280
00:30:51.023 --> 00:30:53.025
among the teeth
that were destroyed completely.

281
00:30:53.329 --> 00:30:54.330
But partial?

282
00:30:55.201 --> 00:30:56.898
It's enough to convict.

283
00:30:57.246 --> 00:30:59.248
And enough to convince forensics.

284
00:30:59.945 --> 00:31:02.338
I'm sorry. but we need to be realistic.

285
00:31:02.469 --> 00:31:03.818
What about DNA?

286
00:31:03.949 --> 00:31:07.169
You told us there wasn't a tongue

287
00:31:07.256 --> 00:31:08.605
found at the scene.

288
00:31:09.215 --> 00:31:11.739
But you said there's always a tongue.

289
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.132
We believe he was interrupted

290
00:31:13.219 --> 00:31:14.829
and wasn't able to complete his ritual.

291
00:31:14.916 --> 00:31:17.745
Why would anyone do this?

292
00:31:20.443 --> 00:31:23.533
He tore our Kelly apart.

293
00:31:23.794 --> 00:31:27.363
And he burned her body.

294
00:31:30.845 --> 00:31:33.369
I want you to... to find him.

295
00:31:36.807 --> 00:31:38.244
And make him pay.

296
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:17.560
Exactly like your father!

297
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:19.910
Diablo! You did it.

298
00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:22.000
because you are a monster!

299
00:33:25.133 --> 00:33:27.527
I'd like to report a suspicious activity

300
00:33:27.614 --> 00:33:28.615
in my neighborhood.

301
00:33:28.745 --> 00:33:29.790
Is this Jiao?

302
00:33:29.964 --> 00:33:31.052
Yes. it's Jiao.

303
00:33:31.705 --> 00:33:32.706
How did you know?

304
00:33:33.315 --> 00:33:34.577
You've been flagged as a repeat caller.

305
00:33:34.621 --> 00:33:36.014
My number is flagged?

306
00:33:36.101 --> 00:33:37.754
Yes. What does that mean?

307
00:33:37.885 --> 00:33:39.060
9-1-1 is for serious calls.

308
00:33:39.147 --> 00:33:41.280
Yes. I know what 9-1-1 is for!

309
00:33:41.367 --> 00:33:42.803
Ma'am. you need to calm down.

310
00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:44.631
Never mind!

311
00:33:56.469 --> 00:33:58.471
What the fuck?

312
00:33:59.907 --> 00:34:01.387
What the fuck is he doing?

313
00:34:08.568 --> 00:34:09.873
He's stuck?

314
00:34:14.574 --> 00:34:16.576
What the fuck?

315
00:34:26.499 --> 00:34:28.196
Thank you for doing this.

316
00:34:28.675 --> 00:34:30.198
I can share some details.

317
00:34:30.329 --> 00:34:32.418
but it is an ongoing federal case.

318
00:34:32.505 --> 00:34:34.681
See. this is everything
that wasn't classified.

319
00:34:35.029 --> 00:34:36.944
You mentioned in one of your reports

320
00:34:37.031 --> 00:34:38.685
something about a work van.

321
00:34:38.772 --> 00:34:40.774
I hounded the local police
for months about it.

322
00:34:40.904 --> 00:34:42.080
Then I finally proved it.

323
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.473
I appreciate that.
- Believe me.

324
00:34:44.604 --> 00:34:46.867
I care deeply about your case.

325
00:34:51.785 --> 00:34:53.134
Uh. so what is this?

326
00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:56.181
It's from the same cabin.

327
00:34:56.529 --> 00:34:59.053
I kept it 'cause I had a theory
that he's self-educated.

328
00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.576
Or was made to learn.

329
00:35:02.404 --> 00:35:04.450
And with my theory about the work vans.

330
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.234
he has journeyman experience.

331
00:35:06.365 --> 00:35:08.541
Construction. plumber.
electrician. carpenter.

332
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.065
I'm sorry.

333
00:35:11.326 --> 00:35:13.502
I really shouldn't be
putting you so close to this.

334
00:35:14.982 --> 00:35:17.289
I'm an engineer. I...
I solve puzzles for a living.

335
00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:20.074
I wanna understand and. uh...

336
00:35:22.772 --> 00:35:26.036
You know. I'd much rather
see him burn alive. but...

337
00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:28.517
my point is...

338
00:35:29.518 --> 00:35:33.174
my point is that. uh. this.
actually. it... it helps.

339
00:35:35.002 --> 00:35:37.787
Burning alive would be a mercy
after all he's done.

340
00:35:38.745 --> 00:35:39.833
But look. Mary.

341
00:35:40.181 --> 00:35:42.662
you still have to address the grief.

342
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.926
I can put you in touch
with other families.

343
00:35:46.013 --> 00:35:47.449
you know. shared trauma can be useful

344
00:35:47.536 --> 00:35:48.494
at a time like this.

345
00:35:49.799 --> 00:35:52.019
Uh. yeah. yeah.
Send that to Robert.

346
00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.459
Um. can I keep this?

347
00:36:42.025 --> 00:36:43.070
You Lucas?

348
00:36:43.766 --> 00:36:45.115
And you'’re Kim?

349
00:36:45.246 --> 00:36:46.160
Yeah.

350
00:36:46.247 --> 00:36:47.205
How'd you find me?

351
00:36:47.292 --> 00:36:48.510
I contacted the hospital.

352
00:36:49.163 --> 00:36:50.251
Okay. good.

353
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:52.732
Just don't tell me why you need it.

354
00:36:53.298 --> 00:36:55.038
and we're good. Kim.

355
00:37:00.827 --> 00:37:03.917
Yeah. Good. Yeah.
I'll... I'll take the lot.

356
00:37:04.657 --> 00:37:05.614
Fuck!

357
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.356
Are you taking down
an elephant or something?

358
00:37:14.493 --> 00:37:16.190
If you need anything else...

359
00:37:17.974 --> 00:37:18.845
Yeah.

360
00:37:19.933 --> 00:37:21.239
Others who have bought this stuff.

361
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:22.936
Anything but that.

362
00:37:24.111 --> 00:37:25.460
Especially no names.

363
00:37:26.766 --> 00:37:31.292
But I can tell you
that these people use numbers.

364
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.163
Numbers? What kind of numbers?

365
00:37:33.294 --> 00:37:35.818
Listen.
I've seen that look before.

366
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.821
If you're on some kind of a revenge kick.

367
00:37:39.909 --> 00:37:42.085
learn how to take someone down first.

368
00:37:42.172 --> 00:37:43.173
Yeah. well.

369
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.958
12 years of Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

370
00:37:45.088 --> 00:37:47.047
I think I'll...
I'll be fine. thanks.

371
00:37:49.267 --> 00:37:52.139
If I can be of any further assistance...

372
00:38:04.194 --> 00:38:06.109
You got any hacking equipment?

373
00:40:49.708 --> 00:40:50.709
No!

374
00:41:20.129 --> 00:41:24.220
Diablo!

375
00:41:53.423 --> 00:41:55.948
Eres un diablo.

376
00:41:56.078 --> 00:41:57.471
You did it!

377
00:41:59.125 --> 00:42:00.256
Because you are a monster!

378
00:42:02.476 --> 00:42:04.217
Devil!...el hijo del diablo!

379
00:42:04.304 --> 00:42:06.262
You killed your own dog!

380
00:42:46.172 --> 00:42:47.521
Canceled my meeting.

381
00:42:47.608 --> 00:42:49.697
I thought maybe we could take a drive.

382
00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.308
Mary? Mary. what have you done?

383
00:42:52.439 --> 00:42:53.701
What have you done?

384
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.398
I'm calling an ambulance...

385
00:42:55.529 --> 00:42:57.009
No! ROBERT: No? What?

386
00:42:57.313 --> 00:43:00.186
No? Mary. what is this shit?

387
00:43:03.276 --> 00:43:05.757
This was in Kelly's toxicology report!

388
00:43:20.467 --> 00:43:21.773
How did you even get this?

389
00:43:25.341 --> 00:43:26.691
I thought...

390
00:43:27.953 --> 00:43:29.476
if I could just build up...

391
00:43:30.608 --> 00:43:32.610
tolerance. just a few times...

392
00:43:32.697 --> 00:43:33.698
Why?

393
00:43:34.133 --> 00:43:36.265
Did you think he was coming for you next?

394
00:43:37.702 --> 00:43:41.575
Mary. this stuff lasts 60 to 80 minutes.

395
00:43:41.662 --> 00:43:44.317
and your watch was at 41
before you could move!

396
00:43:44.883 --> 00:43:46.362
It's been far more than a few.

397
00:43:47.189 --> 00:43:48.930
Let me see your arms.

398
00:44:06.948 --> 00:44:09.255
I've been obsessed
with this case for years

399
00:44:09.385 --> 00:44:11.083
that I let it cloud my judgment.

400
00:44:22.529 --> 00:44:24.662
I can't force you to see anyone...

401
00:44:26.228 --> 00:44:28.187
but you need therapy.

402
00:44:34.846 --> 00:44:36.238
This is my therapy.

403
00:44:36.499 --> 00:44:37.936
Well. find a new outlet.

404
00:44:38.414 --> 00:44:40.939
Pour yourself into another project.

405
00:44:42.767 --> 00:44:43.637
Look...

406
00:44:45.508 --> 00:44:47.510
I have trauma too. Mary.

407
00:44:48.729 --> 00:44:49.817
That top number?

408
00:44:50.339 --> 00:44:52.777
That's someone I see for PTSD.

409
00:44:54.735 --> 00:44:56.694
And look. if it all gets too much...

410
00:44:58.434 --> 00:44:59.740
get away for a while.

411
00:45:00.088 --> 00:45:02.221
You have money! Travel!

412
00:45:02.395 --> 00:45:03.396
Yeah.

413
00:45:04.092 --> 00:45:05.920
I was thinking about
going to the West Coast.

414
00:45:06.007 --> 00:45:08.836
I suggest another continent.

415
00:45:11.796 --> 00:45:14.450
Can I ask you just...
just one more question?

416
00:45:14.755 --> 00:45:16.931
I'm not entertaining any more theories

417
00:45:17.018 --> 00:45:18.193
with you. Mary. Come on!

418
00:45:18.367 --> 00:45:20.630
All right. then give me
the official FBI statement.

419
00:45:20.979 --> 00:45:23.285
Why these states?
Why California.

420
00:45:23.372 --> 00:45:25.070
Colorado. New York?

421
00:45:25.157 --> 00:45:28.073
All states with large forests?
I don't know. Mary!

422
00:45:28.464 --> 00:45:29.465
Maybe he was...

423
00:45:30.075 --> 00:45:32.033
following something or hunting someone.

424
00:45:32.164 --> 00:45:33.382
That's all I can give you.

425
00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:35.515
No. We're missing something.

426
00:45:36.255 --> 00:45:37.735
There were two murders in different states

427
00:45:37.822 --> 00:45:39.649
at the same time. how'd he do that?

428
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:41.390
Maybe he had an accomplice.

429
00:45:44.263 --> 00:45:45.438
Excuse me.

430
00:45:45.525 --> 00:45:47.048
Agent Wall. may I speak
with you for a second?

431
00:45:47.135 --> 00:45:48.528
Mary. I'll be back with you soon.

432
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:51.879
What is it. Agent Quiller?

433
00:46:37.882 --> 00:46:41.276
But I can tell you
that these people use numbers.

434
00:46:41.537 --> 00:46:43.061
Especially no names.

435
00:46:59.729 --> 00:47:00.818
Oh. fuck!

436
00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.401
Mary! Uh...

437
00:47:19.924 --> 00:47:21.273
Can you come back?

438
00:47:21.664 --> 00:47:24.798
Mary. you've been holed up
down here for almost three days.

439
00:47:25.146 --> 00:47:26.234
You need to get out!

440
00:47:27.235 --> 00:47:28.454
Okay.

441
00:47:29.977 --> 00:47:31.370
Yeah. um...

442
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.242
I thought we agreed
that this is my work space.

443
00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:36.070
I don't go into yours.
you don't come into mine.

444
00:47:36.201 --> 00:47:38.507
Yeah. but I don'’t shut you out of it.

445
00:47:38.594 --> 00:47:41.467
I don't fucking
sleep up there either. MARY: No. hey!

446
00:47:43.686 --> 00:47:45.819
Just leave me.

447
00:47:48.387 --> 00:47:49.649
Jesus. Mary!

448
00:47:49.997 --> 00:47:51.259
What is all this?

449
00:47:51.825 --> 00:47:53.827
What is this?

450
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:56.525
I am... I'm just trying
to cope right now.

451
00:47:56.612 --> 00:47:58.266
This is how I'm healing.

452
00:47:58.701 --> 00:48:00.834
Mary. we're together in this.

453
00:48:01.182 --> 00:48:03.402
I'm the one who insisted
Kelly take that trail

454
00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:05.273
alone that day.

455
00:48:05.621 --> 00:48:08.668
You think I don't punish myself for that?

456
00:48:09.364 --> 00:48:11.540
Now look.
I'm seeing a trauma therapist

457
00:48:11.627 --> 00:48:13.847
to help me cope.
You can do the same.

458
00:48:14.456 --> 00:48:16.371
Yeah. Yeah. I will do that.

459
00:48:17.764 --> 00:48:19.679
You know. I can tell
when you're bullshitting me.

460
00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:22.464
What did you buy? An RFID chip?

461
00:48:22.551 --> 00:48:26.381
Look. just don't touch my shit. Fire jets?

462
00:48:27.556 --> 00:48:30.211
I don't know what the fuck you're doing.

463
00:48:30.298 --> 00:48:32.910
but I can't support this obsession.

464
00:48:34.433 --> 00:48:36.130
I can't live like this!

465
00:48:38.132 --> 00:48:39.394
Are you gonna stop?

466
00:48:43.703 --> 00:48:44.922
Are you gonna stop?

467
00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:50.840
No.

468
00:48:53.713 --> 00:48:54.627
All right.

469
00:49:11.035 --> 00:49:13.298
I'm here to investigate a property.

470
00:49:13.515 --> 00:49:15.430
Our records are in the basement.

471
00:49:15.561 --> 00:49:18.651
but I'’m afraid access
is restricted unless you. um...

472
00:49:18.781 --> 00:49:19.695
Yeah.

473
00:49:22.089 --> 00:49:23.482
Agent Wall.

474
00:49:23.873 --> 00:49:27.094
I'm sure you're familiar
with the Diablo Killer case.

475
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:29.923
Oh. yes. Right this way.

476
00:49:35.624 --> 00:49:36.974
Oh. Wall. you said?

477
00:49:37.061 --> 00:49:38.714
Were you here with your colleagues

478
00:49:38.801 --> 00:49:39.802
a few years ago?

479
00:49:42.588 --> 00:49:43.676
Good memory.

480
00:49:44.111 --> 00:49:46.418
Oh. nothing much happens
around here. We. uh.

481
00:49:46.505 --> 00:49:47.897
tend to remember big stuff.

482
00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:50.552
Your people took the most recent records

483
00:49:50.683 --> 00:49:53.294
and. uh. well. I don't know what's left.

484
00:49:53.599 --> 00:49:55.035
I have copies of those.

485
00:50:01.824 --> 00:50:04.392
Right. Well. if you. uh.
have any questions...

486
00:50:04.523 --> 00:50:05.741
Oh. thank you.

487
00:50:25.326 --> 00:50:26.675
Oh. yes.

488
00:50:53.659 --> 00:50:55.835
Those are full of... Excuse me. excuse me.

489
00:50:55.965 --> 00:50:58.098
Hold on one sec. Um.

490
00:50:58.359 --> 00:51:00.753
so why...
why did this little area.

491
00:51:00.883 --> 00:51:03.190
why did it keep changing hands
all through the forties?

492
00:51:03.277 --> 00:51:07.194
Oh. there's an old creek bed
that runs along that lot.

493
00:51:07.325 --> 00:51:10.632
It got rerouted
a couple of times and. uh...

494
00:51:11.111 --> 00:51:14.506
dried up and they built
a new spillway up river.

495
00:51:14.810 --> 00:51:17.683
Looks like a surveying dispute.

496
00:51:19.424 --> 00:51:22.427
So there's an additional piece
of land that nobody knows exists

497
00:51:22.514 --> 00:51:25.082
and no one has ever questioned it before?

498
00:51:25.169 --> 00:51:27.171
No. just never came up.

499
00:51:27.954 --> 00:51:30.913
Actually. hey. uh. Sheriff.
let me bring you in on this

500
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.959
while I got an agent here.

501
00:51:33.046 --> 00:51:35.092
Uh. what did you say your name was?

502
00:51:40.227 --> 00:51:42.795
After staying out
of the public eye for months.

503
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.146
Kelly's grieving mother. Mary.
finally broke her silence

504
00:51:46.233 --> 00:51:47.800
with righteous anger.

505
00:51:48.192 --> 00:51:49.976
He took everything from me.

506
00:51:50.542 --> 00:51:54.459
And he will strike again
and again. and again.

507
00:51:54.981 --> 00:51:57.418
The feds aren't doing shit.

508
00:51:58.115 --> 00:51:59.203
You think you're safe?

509
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:02.423
You're not fucking safe.

510
00:52:02.858 --> 00:52:04.860
We need to get out there.

511
00:52:05.774 --> 00:52:08.255
and we need to find that sick fuck.

512
00:52:24.097 --> 00:52:25.446
That's a cabin back there?

513
00:52:29.798 --> 00:52:31.583
No one saw it?

514
00:52:33.019 --> 00:52:34.020
What?

515
00:52:38.633 --> 00:52:40.896
We have no records of family at all.

516
00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.811
We currently have a media release

517
00:52:42.898 --> 00:52:44.770
inviting anyone
with any relevant information

518
00:52:44.857 --> 00:52:47.773
to work with us. so any insights
to relatives alive.

519
00:52:47.903 --> 00:52:49.905
dead. or even grave sites are appreciated.

520
00:54:13.815 --> 00:54:15.339
Kelly had been just accepted

521
00:54:15.426 --> 00:54:17.341
into the University of New York City

522
00:54:17.558 --> 00:54:19.691
and overcame a lifelong disability

523
00:54:19.778 --> 00:54:21.083
with experimental surgery.

524
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.651
She was eager to test out
her repaired knee...

525
00:54:23.738 --> 00:54:25.610
on the trails at her favorite park

526
00:54:25.697 --> 00:54:27.742
until the Diablo Killer resurfaced.

527
00:57:42.981 --> 00:57:44.025
System armed.

528
00:58:55.444 --> 00:58:57.011
Access denied.

529
00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:14.507
Oh. you fuck!

530
00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.210
System malfunction.

531
00:59:37.443 --> 00:59:38.966
Door unlocked.

532
00:59:43.014 --> 00:59:44.363
No. no. no. no. no!

533
00:59:47.018 --> 00:59:48.497
Door locked.

534
00:59:56.505 --> 00:59:57.681
Tongue of the devil!

535
00:59:57.768 --> 00:59:59.378
You have the tongue
of the devil. you have.

536
00:59:59.508 --> 01:00:00.684
Monstruo!

537
01:00:10.998 --> 01:00:12.086
Hey!

538
01:00:14.088 --> 01:00:15.176
Hey!

539
01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:17.048
Hey!

540
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.053
Hey! Hi. Jiao.

541
01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:24.969
What took you so long?
I called you hours ago!

542
01:00:26.057 --> 01:00:27.449
Something's not right with your wife.

543
01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:29.756
We're separated right now.
but thanks for the concern.

544
01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:47.600
No. no. no.
You don't get to see that.

545
01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:50.821
No!

546
01:00:56.087 --> 01:00:57.131
You fuck!

547
01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.845
No!

548
01:01:18.196 --> 01:01:20.024
No! No!

549
01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:25.769
Fuck you!

550
01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:19.561
System armed.

551
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:34.576
System locked.

552
01:02:34.707 --> 01:02:36.013
She locked me out of the system!

553
01:02:41.148 --> 01:02:42.715
Mary. it's Robert!

554
01:02:42.889 --> 01:02:43.890
Let me in?

555
01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:53.378
I just...

556
01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.423
I want to see you're okay.

557
01:02:55.989 --> 01:02:59.036
I'm not leaving until I see you. Mary.

558
01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:01.038
She did the same to me!

559
01:03:15.922 --> 01:03:17.489
Door unlocked.

560
01:05:20.568 --> 01:05:23.267
Jiao. what are you doing here?
Robert. what's going on?

561
01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:25.399
Look. I don't know.
I'm worried about Mary.

562
01:05:25.530 --> 01:05:27.227
She's locked me out.
she won't come to the door.

563
01:05:27.314 --> 01:05:28.446
I just wanna know she's okay.

564
01:05:28.533 --> 01:05:30.230
I thought maybe she'd respond to you.

565
01:05:30.317 --> 01:05:32.189
I know you two have gotten close.

566
01:05:37.846 --> 01:05:38.935
Mary. it's Selena!

567
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:44.070
Robert called me.
we're both concerned about you.

568
01:05:55.168 --> 01:05:56.691
Mary. answer the door!

569
01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:05.613
System unarmed.

570
01:06:08.747 --> 01:06:11.706
Okay. Robert. wait out here.
Jiao. go home.

571
01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:22.456
FBI! On the ground!

572
01:06:22.543 --> 01:06:24.850
On the ground!
Hands behind your head. now!

573
01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:48.482
Fuck you!

574
01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:50.571
Fuck!

575
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:56.621
Mary.

576
01:06:58.101 --> 01:06:59.145
She's bleeding out!

577
01:06:59.276 --> 01:07:01.408
Get the med-kit.
Get the med-kit. now!

578
01:07:02.801 --> 01:07:04.455
All right. look at me.
look at me. look at me.

579
01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:06.326
- look at me.
- You're okay. you're okay.

580
01:07:06.413 --> 01:07:07.762
All right. all right.

581
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.112
Come on!

582
01:07:09.329 --> 01:07:11.331
All right. all right. all right.

583
01:07:14.813 --> 01:07:16.119
Come on. babe!

584
01:07:18.469 --> 01:07:19.383
Hurry!

585
01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:24.214
Put your hand here. that's it.

586
01:07:28.261 --> 01:07:29.219
Mary!

587
01:07:29.871 --> 01:07:33.136
Whatever you're about to do.
please. don't do it!

588
01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:34.267
Please!

589
01:07:35.877 --> 01:07:37.401
I can't just turn a blind eye!

590
01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:40.186
Make the call. Make the call!

591
01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:44.234
Agent down. a civilian is shot.

592
01:07:44.321 --> 01:07:46.497
Send backup to the Flint residence!

593
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:51.241
This is the motherfucker
that killed our daughter!

594
01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.196
Remember her?

595
01:10:05.418 --> 01:10:06.811
Her name was Kelly!

596
01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:23.975
Diablo. the nameless man.

597
01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:29.197
I've spent months sifting
through the ashes of your life.

598
01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.940
FBI. police. they didn't know
what to look for. but...

599
01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:34.725
I did.

600
01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.781
Sarah.

601
01:11:48.478 --> 01:11:50.871
Devil. a monster!
Son of your father!

602
01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:52.873
Exactly like your father. you are.

603
01:11:55.485 --> 01:11:58.444
You killed your own mother.

604
01:12:02.187 --> 01:12:04.407
And maybe this is your father.

605
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:07.758
Maybe he's Sarah's father too.

606
01:12:08.628 --> 01:12:10.282
You're an inbred fuck.

607
01:12:14.634 --> 01:12:16.854
The one thing I don't understand is...

608
01:12:18.159 --> 01:12:20.031
did your mother resent you?

609
01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.076
Tienes la lengua del diablo!

610
01:12:22.468 --> 01:12:24.949
Did she silence you? SARAH: Devil!

611
01:12:25.036 --> 01:12:26.472
Eres un diablo.

612
01:12:26.777 --> 01:12:28.387
You killed your own dog!

613
01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:34.611
Did she call you Diablo?

614
01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:36.090
Diablo!

615
01:12:41.487 --> 01:12:42.619
She punished you.

616
01:12:44.534 --> 01:12:45.796
So you punished her.

617
01:12:47.232 --> 01:12:49.234
The pain wasn't enough. was it?

618
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:54.631
It never really is.

619
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:58.852
And it never. ever stops.
I know. I know.

620
01:13:00.027 --> 01:13:02.334
Because that's all you've made me feel...

621
01:13:04.815 --> 01:13:06.338
and that's how I found you.

622
01:13:09.341 --> 01:13:12.431
I found what they missed.

623
01:13:13.214 --> 01:13:14.607
Each of your kills...

624
01:13:15.695 --> 01:13:18.568
is by a family's private cemetery plot...

625
01:13:20.483 --> 01:13:22.963
just like where Sarah is buried.

626
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:26.880
I searched every public record

627
01:13:27.272 --> 01:13:29.579
for every private family plot

628
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:32.669
near a forested trail within 100 miles.

629
01:13:33.278 --> 01:13:35.280
I narrowed them down one by one.

630
01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:40.764
I studied your psych profiles.

631
01:13:49.555 --> 01:13:52.166
Huh? See that?

632
01:14:04.570 --> 01:14:05.789
See this?

633
01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.317
Go ahead.
Open your fucking mouth.

634
01:14:12.622 --> 01:14:14.624
just like you did to those girls.

635
01:14:14.928 --> 01:14:16.364
Yes...

636
01:14:30.204 --> 01:14:31.249
See this?

637
01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:36.689
My name...

638
01:14:36.994 --> 01:14:38.996
is Mary Flint.

639
01:14:41.215 --> 01:14:42.913
You murdered my daughter.

640
01:14:43.827 --> 01:14:45.393
Kelly Flint.

641
01:14:48.222 --> 01:14:49.659
I will find you...

642
01:14:51.835 --> 01:14:53.140
and I will kill you.

643
01:15:08.329 --> 01:15:10.331
Scream for me. fucker!

644
01:16:14.744 --> 01:16:16.441
Del Diablo!

645
01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:19.792
The son of the devil.
exactly like your father! Devil!

646
01:18:37.321 --> 01:18:38.409
He's dead.

647
01:18:39.018 --> 01:18:41.194
FBI! FBI. Agent Wall!

648
01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:43.196
Agent Wall. what the hell happened?

649
01:18:43.327 --> 01:18:44.458
The Diablo Killer.

650
01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:46.983
He came into the house.
he came after my wife.

651
01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:48.375
He's dead.

652
01:18:48.506 --> 01:18:50.813
It was... it was self-defense.

653
01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:53.685
We have an agent down!
I need medics immediately!

654
01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.253
Keep pressure. keep pressure.
keep pressure.

655
01:18:56.383 --> 01:18:57.254
It's okay.

656
01:18:59.473 --> 01:19:00.431
Keep pressure!

657
01:19:02.868 --> 01:19:03.956
Stay with me. stay with me!

658
01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:07.264
She needs medical assistance right here.

659
01:19:08.569 --> 01:19:10.702
Stay with us. stay with us.
you're good. You're all right.

660
01:19:16.708 --> 01:19:18.014
This Diablo Killer

661
01:19:18.101 --> 01:19:20.146
has a type when it comes to these murders.

662
01:19:20.277 --> 01:19:22.235
Always female. always brunette.

663
01:19:22.366 --> 01:19:24.455
similar heights and facial features.

664
01:19:24.934 --> 01:19:27.806
He appears to relocate to
a new state after three victims.

665
01:19:27.937 --> 01:19:29.068
We're hear at the cabin.

666
01:19:29.155 --> 01:19:30.983
which was built on repossessed land.

667
01:19:31.201 --> 01:19:32.811
While there were no official records

668
01:19:32.898 --> 01:19:33.986
of past residents.

669
01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.249
some have speculated that the killer lived

670
01:19:36.336 --> 01:19:38.948
inside this abandoned homestead
at some point.

671
01:19:39.426 --> 01:19:42.647
It took one FBI agent years
to connect the dots.

672
01:19:42.865 --> 01:19:45.432
A leaked profile indicated
that he may have been working

673
01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:48.044
as a laborer in the areas
of each of the killings.

674
01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.176
In more recent news.

675
01:19:50.307 --> 01:19:52.309
the man once dubbed the Diablo Killer

676
01:19:52.396 --> 01:19:53.876
finally met his match

677
01:19:54.006 --> 01:19:56.095
when the mother
of one of the deceased victims

678
01:19:56.226 --> 01:19:58.358
took matters into her own hands.

679
01:19:58.445 --> 01:20:00.056
However. authorities are baffled

680
01:20:00.143 --> 01:20:02.536
as a series of new murders have emerged.

681
01:20:02.623 --> 01:20:04.147
all with missing tongues.

682
01:20:04.234 --> 01:20:07.193
raising the question.
"Was Diablo working alone

683
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.282
or was there an accomplice?"
