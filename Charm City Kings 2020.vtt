What the actual fuck

1217
00:59:41.015 --> 00:59:44.014
Why would you even let
somebody ride that bike?

1218
00:59:44.016 --> 00:59:47.004
[Sweartagawd] Swear to God.

I mean.
'cause I could find out
where that nigga stay at.

1236
01:00:29.018 --> 01:00:31.013
Stomp his ass into

1237
01:00:31.015 --> 01:00:33.019
How's that gonna help? Huh?

1238
01:00:34.019 --> 01:00:37.009
Who knows? Maybe it won't.

1239
01:00:37.011 --> 01:00:39.000
I mean. but if you got
a Derrick pancake

1240
01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:40.010
stuck on the bottom
of your shoe...

1241
01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:43.007
At least Blax'll know
you ain't no punk.

1242
01:00:43.009 --> 01:00:45.001
I'd be still thinking
he a little punk.

01:00:45.003 --> 01:00:47.010
You did let his bike get took.

1244
01:00:47.012 --> 01:00:49.017
Nigga. I'd rather be
half a punk who
got his ass beat

1245
01:00:49.019 --> 01:00:52.003

01:25:47.023 --> 01:25:50.011
And I said to myself. I said.
"Man. I know this guy.

1691
01:25:50.013 --> 01:25:55.005
Bryan. Bryan. Yeah!
Bryan from the West Side.

1692
01:25:55.007 --> 01:25:57.007
Grew up on
the same block. Yeah.

1693
01:25:57.009 --> 01:25:58.013
Little big-head-ass Bryan.

1694
01:25:58.015 --> 01:26:00.002
used to follow
behind us and shit.

1695
01:26:00.004 --> 01:26:01.019
Yeah. I know him.

1696
01:26:01.021 --> 01:26:03.017
Turned out to be
one cold-hearted brother.

1697
01:26:03.019 --> 01:26:06.017
but yeah. I know him."

1698
01:26:06.019 --> 01:26:08.023
Man. nigga. you don't
fuckin' know me.

1699
01:26:09.014 --> 01:26:10.021
Maybe you right.

1700
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:14.002
I thought I did.

1701
01:26:15.006 --> 01:26:18.004
But I had no idea how cold

1702
01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:21.014
-M.N.C. Blax really was.
-Nigga. you don't know shit.

1703
01:26:22.013 --> 01:26:24.005
[chuckles]

1704
01:26:24.007 --> 01:26:27.006
I know when we found Stro.
he had. like. what?

1705
01:26:27.008 --> 01:26:29.000
800. 900 on him.

1706
01:26:29.002 --> 01:26:30.018
And what kid you know
from West Baltimore

1707
01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:33.000
got that kinda cash on him
unless he trappin'?

1708
01:26:33.002 --> 01:26:34.021
Stro don't trap.

1709
01:26:34.023 --> 01:26:36.012
I was lookin' out
for Stro.

1710
01:26:39.017 --> 01:26:41.013
Well. you did
a hell of a job.

1711
01:26:44.008 --> 01:26:46.020
No matter how
you cut it. Bryan...

1712
01:26:48.010 --> 01:26:49.021
this on you. ain't it?

1713
01:26:50.021 --> 01:26:52.022
Ain't none
of your fucking business.

1714
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.016
Now what else you want?

1715
01:26:54.018 --> 01:26:56.023
I wanna make sure
that the same thing
doesn't happen to Mouse.

1716
01:26:57.001 --> 01:26:58.023
I wanna make sure that
the same thing doesn't happen

1717
01:26:59.001 --> 01:27:00.015
to any of these
other young Black boys

1718
01:27:00.017 --> 01:27:02.017
followin' your ass
down the same road.

1719
01:27:02.019 --> 01:27:05.018
I know you ain't just said
what I think you said.

1720
01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:09.000
Black boys?
What about Black boys?

1721
01:27:10.002 --> 01:27:12.016
You don't give a fuck
about Black boys.

1722
01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:16.010
Matter of fact. you ain't even
Black no more. nigga. You blue.

1723
01:27:16.012 --> 01:27:17.022
Bitch-ass nigga.

1724
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.020
That's why Mouse
don't wanna be
around you now.

1725
01:27:19.022 --> 01:27:21.011
Fuckin' joke.

1726
01:27:22.021 --> 01:27:24.000
He know I'm the only nigga

1727
01:27:24.002 --> 01:27:26.006
around here
that care about him.

1728
01:27:26.008 --> 01:27:28.011
Only nigga around here
that ain't on a payroll

1729
01:27:28.013 --> 01:27:30.010
to act like
he care about him.

1730
01:27:32.023 --> 01:27:34.016
Ah. Okay.

1731
01:27:36.015 --> 01:27:39.012
You and I both know...

1732
01:27:39.014 --> 01:27:41.008
that the best thing
that could ever happen to Mouse

1733
01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:44.001
is for a nigga like you
to be out of his life forever.

1734
01:27:46.021 --> 01:27:48.023
Let me ask you somethin'. Blax.

1735
01:27:49.013 --> 01:27:50.015
Bryan.

1736
01:27:53.019 --> 01:27:55.020
Does Mouse know
what really happened to Stro?

1737
01:28:01.002 --> 01:28:02.005
Figures.

1738
01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:14.014
[Sweartagawd] Oh. Mouse. if you

1739
01:28:14.016 --> 01:28:16.020

my toothbrush. a'ight?

1740
01:28:16.022 --> 01:28:18.017
That shit's nasty. yo.

1741
01:28:18.019 --> 01:28:20.009
[Mouse] Yeah. whatever. yo.

1743
01:28:22.021 --> 01:28:25.019
Nigga. these are better

01:28:25.021 --> 01:28:27.017
-Here we go.

1745
01:28:27.019 --> 01:28:30.009
-This is the best shit ever.

1746
01:28:30.011 --> 01:28:31.019
Yes. they are.

1747
01:28:31.021 --> 01:28:32.022
-What're you talkin' about. yo?
-No. they not.

1748
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.006
They way different textures.

1749
01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:36.000
No. they're not.
They're both gummy.

1750
01:28:36.002 --> 01:28:37.017
-They're literally both gummy.
-Those are Sour Patch Kids.

1751
01:28:37.019 --> 01:28:39.012
-These are gummy bears.
-But they're both gummies.

1752
01:28:39.014 --> 01:28:41.004
-Hey. yo. Jamal
was right about us.
-They're sour.

1753
01:28:41.006 --> 01:28:43.004
-Fuck you talkin' about?
-Here we go.

1754
01:28:43.006 --> 01:28:46.010
He was right about us. a'ight?

1755
01:28:46.012 --> 01:28:48.020
We doin' the same shit
we always used to do.

1756
01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:50.016
We just sittin' on
some borrowed bikes.

1757
01:28:50.018 --> 01:28:54.011
Hey. nigga.
I love my borrowed bike.

1758
01:28:54.013 --> 01:28:57.001
Oh. yeah? What happens
if you wreck it?

1759
01:28:57.003 --> 01:29:00.004
What you think Jamal gonna say?
What you think Jamal gonna do?

1760
01:29:00.006 --> 01:29:01.019
Forgive and forget?

1761
01:29:01.021 --> 01:29:04.017
Take a couple
thousand dollar loss
and just move on?

1762
01:29:04.019 --> 01:29:06.018
I mean. seriously.
did y'all even think about

1763
01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:08.016
the deal we took
when we got these bikes?

1764
01:29:08.018 --> 01:29:11.018
-Nigga. did you?
-Yes. And I am now.

1765
01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:13.022
So what would you like us
to do. then. Mouse?

1766
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.014
Make our own money.
Get our own bike.

1767
01:29:16.016 --> 01:29:18.022
That's the kinda shit
we need to be on. yo.

1768
01:29:20.023 --> 01:29:23.022
[sighs] Ay. look.
it's like this.

1769
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.014
As long as we keep
holdin' our hands out.

1770
01:29:26.016 --> 01:29:29.015
we always gonna be seen
as some little kids.

1771
01:29:29.017 --> 01:29:31.019
And I don't know about y'all.
but I'm sick and tired

1772
01:29:31.021 --> 01:29:33.017
of grown folks
runnin' my life.

1773
01:29:35.012 --> 01:29:38.020
Boys wait for other people.
Men go out and get it.

1774
01:29:39.013 --> 01:29:41.020
I'm tryin' to go get it.

1775
01:29:41.022 --> 01:29:44.001
How the fuck
we supposed to do that. Mouse?

1776
01:29:44.019 --> 01:29:45.023
Huh?

1777
01:29:47.006 --> 01:29:49.019
We can just rob
that motherfucker right there.

1778
01:29:54.005 --> 01:29:57.008
-Is you high?
-Nah. think about it.

1779
01:29:57.010 --> 01:29:59.008
We'll get the props we need

1780
01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:02.016
for actually doin' something.
Something real.

1781
01:30:02.018 --> 01:30:05.003
And we can get the cash
to get all our bikes.

1782
01:30:05.005 --> 01:30:06.013
It's a win-win.

1783
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:09.005
Yeah.

1784
01:30:09.007 --> 01:30:10.022
Yeah. it'd be easy.

1785
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.003
Old man Kim ain't gonna
put up no fight.

1786
01:30:13.005 --> 01:30:14.010
We get in. we get out.

1787
01:30:14.012 --> 01:30:16.005
we get the cash.
we get our own bikes.

1788
01:30:16.007 --> 01:30:20.003
And we prove to Jamal

Y'all do know this.

1792
01:30:26.005 --> 01:30:29.012
Jail time. Doin' our nickel.
Don't drop the soap. like...

1793
01:30:29.014 --> 01:30:32.000

Let's go get it.

1796
01:30:40.015 --> 01:30:41.019
I don't know.

1797
01:30:41.021 --> 01:30:43.010
Y'all know

1798
01:30:43.012 --> 01:30:44.020
-We know we ready. Queen.

01:31:31.002 --> 01:31:33.006
Whoo... Pay up.

Yeah. it's the shit

1823
01:31:55.008 --> 01:31:57.006
Keep the money

1824
01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:01.006
What's the problem?
Nigga. I'm on parole.

1825
01:32:01.008 --> 01:32:03.022
You know if the cops
come up in here. I'm done.

1826
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.014
All right. We gonna chill.

1827
01:32:07.008 --> 01:32:09.018
I'll let niggas know

1828
01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:11.023
Cool? What else?

Fall back off Mouse. nigga.

Yeah. whatever.

1835
01:32:26.015 --> 01:32:28.003
Tell that little nigga

1836
01:32:28.005 --> 01:32:29.023
and go ahead
about his business.

1837
01:32:30.001 --> 01:32:33.007
Oh. yeah.

he came asking for a piece.

1839
01:32:35.005 --> 01:32:37.018
And you fuckin' gave it to him.

1840
01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:39.005
Pretty sure
I was around the same age

1841
01:32:39.007 --> 01:32:41.006

1842
01:32:42.001 --> 01:32:43.007
[engine revving]

1843
01:32:51.013 --> 01:32:53.004
[grunting playfully]

1844
01:32:57.006 --> 01:32:59.002
-I didn't contribute that.

[Sweartagawd]
Don't even do that.

1850
01:33:16.018 --> 01:33:18.011

So. what we supposed to do?

1892
01:35:44.001 --> 01:35:46.019

I was talkin'

1920
01:37:44.002 --> 01:37:46.018
He should've

Wait. what you talkin' about?

1922
01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:51.009
He called me...

1923
01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:55.014
and he kept tellin' me
how he needed money

1924

He ain't never make it back

1928
