I am so sorry

- Yeah.
- And her struggling business.

413

on your shoulders.

419
00:18:01.077 --> 00:18:02.287

420
00:18:02.287 --> 00:18:03.957
an exciting opportunity
for the both of us.

421

really high for some work.

I don't need to tell you

425
00:18:12.892 --> 00:18:15.146
that the bank
has filed a notice of default.

426
00:18:15.523 --> 00:18:16.608
What?

427
00:18:16.608 --> 00:18:18.737
And it's not news to you.
of course.

428
00:18:18.737 --> 00:18:22.285
that they're weeks away from
foreclosing on this place.

429
00:18:24.749 --> 00:18:27.672
No. that's definitely
not news to me.

430
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.395
Listen. I think I can help you
get out of this jam.

431
00:18:35.563 --> 00:18:36.898
I know I speak on behalf

432
00:18:36.898 --> 00:18:38.694
of my entire
board of directors

433
00:18:38.861 --> 00:18:41.240
when I say
that Barnswell Capital

434
00:18:41.407 --> 00:18:44.204

to interrupt
that conversation.

439
00:18:58.859 --> 00:18:59.944
That was very
out of character for me.

- A little brazen...
- Hey. you can't tell anyone

441
00:19:01.615 --> 00:19:04.203
about this
foreclosure thing. okay?

442

they're not people

that we should be
getting into bed with.

447
00:19:15.266 --> 00:19:17.814

and I think Joan's success is.
in large part.

451
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.788
due to the fact
that she has leaned on us.

453
00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:29.796

Family.
