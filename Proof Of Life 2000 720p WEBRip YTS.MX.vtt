WHAT WAS THE POINT?

270
00:12:54.808 --> 00:12:56.209

HOW ABOUT 8 YEARS
OF SHIT POSTINGS?

275
00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:06.719
8 YEARS OF WORKING
FOR ASSHOLES?

276
00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:09.322
8 YEARS OF WORKING WITH
SOMEBODY ELSE'S BAD IDEAS?

JUST ALL SHIT NOW?

280
00:13:15.062 --> 00:13:16.196
IS THAT WHAT I SAID?

281
00:13:16.196 --> 00:13:17.664
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT WE WERE DOING

282
00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:19.099
EXACTLY WHAT
WE WANTED TO DO.

283
00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:21.134
I THOUGHT WE WERE LIVING
OUR LIVES TOGETHER!

284
00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.904
THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAID!
THIS ISN'T JUST A JOB.

285
00:13:23.904 --> 00:13:25.805
THIS IS EVERYTHING
I HAVE PREPARED FOR

286
00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.574
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

287
00:13:29.076 --> 00:13:30.210

IF THEY COME IN HERE

289
00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:34.314
AND TAKE THIS OVER.
I AM FUCKED.

290
00:13:35.983 --> 00:13:38.485
WELL. I WOULDN'T GET
TOO UPSET ABOUT IT.

291
00:13:38.485 --> 00:13:41.288
MAYBE OCTONAL WANTS
A DAM OF THEIR VERY OWN.

292
00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:43.356
OCTONAL DOESN'T BUILD DAMS.
THEY KICK ASS.

293
00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:44.858
THEY DON'T CARE
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.

294
00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:46.193

I'M BUILDING A DAM

301
00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:56.103
THAT'S GOING TO SAVE
PEOPLE'S LIVES!

302
00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:58.238
YOU ARE BUILDING A DAM

303
00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:00.773
CAN GET A PIPELINE CONTRACT.

304
00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:02.109

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.015
THERE'S
HEALTHCARE PROJECTS.

324
00:14:42.015 --> 00:14:43.250
ANY ONE OF THEM.
THEY'D BE THRILLED

325
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.551
TO HAVE YOU ON THEIR STAFF.

326
00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:45.652

5 MONTHS.
YOU'RE FLAPPIN' AROUND HERE.

333
00:14:54.962 --> 00:14:56.997
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED
TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE.

334
00:14:56.997 --> 00:14:58.765
I AM NOT GETTING
PREGNANT AGAIN

335
00:14:58.765 --> 00:14:59.832

AND. SOMEHOW. WE'RE
BACK TO THIS AGENDA.

349
00:15:25.225 --> 00:15:27.927
I AM NOT AN AGENDA.

00:15:36.603 --> 00:15:38.671
WELL. YOU KNOW WHAT?

351
00:15:38.671 --> 00:15:40.807
GO HOME.

00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:44.511
TAKE A BREAK.

354
00:15:46.679 --> 00:15:47.914
WOW.

355

872
00:38:51.697 --> 00:38:52.931
NOW. WE'RE DOING
WHAT WE CAN.

873
00:38:52.931 --> 00:38:54.533
WE'RE TALKING
TO OCTONAL.

874
00:38:54.533 --> 00:38:55.801
WE'RE TRYING
TO GET THEIR INPUT.

875
00:38:55.801 --> 00:38:57.536
WE'RE HOPING THEY'LL
STEP UP AND COVER THIS.

876
00:38:57.536 --> 00:38:58.770
BUT AT THIS POINT--

877
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.706
WELL. DON'T THEY
HAVE TO?

878
00:39:00.706 --> 00:39:01.807
WELL. THEIR POSITION
IS THEY'RE--

879
00:39:01.807 --> 00:39:03.008
THEY'RE
BUYING A PIPELINE.

880
00:39:03.008 --> 00:39:03.809
NOT THE COMPANY.

881
00:39:03.809 --> 00:39:05.544
SO IT'S
A BIT COMPLICATED.

882
00:39:05.544 --> 00:39:06.812
THEIR POSITION?

883
00:39:06.812 --> 00:39:08.313
HOW DO THEY ALREADY
HAVE A POSITION?

884
00:39:08.313 --> 00:39:09.615
THIS JUST HAPPENED.

885
00:39:09.615 --> 00:39:11.950
Janis: EXCUSE ME. COULD
YOU JUST TELL ME WHERE

886
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.319
QUAD-CARBON STANDS
IN ALL OF THIS?

887
00:39:14.319 --> 00:39:16.488
QUAD-CARBON
IS EVAPORATING.

888
00:39:17.523 --> 00:39:19.190
I MEAN.
THEY'RE SELLING OFF

889
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.258
WHAT THEY CAN.

890
00:39:20.258 --> 00:39:22.628
JUST A LITTLE LATE
FOR MIRACLES.

891
00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:27.433
SO. YOU'RE
ALL OUT OF WORK?

892
00:39:27.433 --> 00:39:29.134
IT WOULD SEEM SO.

893
00:39:35.073 --> 00:39:36.341
Alice: AND WHO'S THIS?

894
00:39:36.341 --> 00:39:38.810
ALICE. THIS
IS ARTURO FERNANDEZ.

895
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.278
SEÑORA BOWMAN.

896
00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:41.480
NOW. MR. FERNANDEZ
HAS BEEN

897
00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.449
OUR LOCAL SECURITY
COORDINATOR FOR YEARS.

898
00:39:43.449 --> 00:39:46.351
HE IS VERY WELL-CONNECTED
AND VERY EXPERIENCED.

899
00:39:46.351 --> 00:39:47.453
AND I THINK IF YOU
GIVE US

900
00:39:47.453 --> 00:39:48.687
A COUPLE MINUTES
TO TALK THIS OVER.

901
00:39:48.687 --> 00:39:50.522
YOU'RE GONNA REALIZE
JUST HOW LUCKY WE ARE

902
00:39:50.522 --> 00:39:52.858
TO HAVE HIM
WORKING WITH US.

903
00:40:11.943 --> 00:40:13.845
MR. THORNE.
YOU'RE LEAVING SO SOON.

904
00:40:13.845 --> 00:40:16.047
GRACIAS. PERHAPS NEXT TIME.
WE CAN GO DANCING.

905
00:40:16.047 --> 00:40:16.848
WONDERFUL.

906
00:40:16.848 --> 00:40:19.050
BOY. DID YOU
HAVE ME FOOLED.

907
00:40:20.852 --> 00:40:22.120
I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO CALL YOU.

908
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.522
WHERE. FROM THE PLANE?

909
00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:26.558
YOU STOOD IN MY HOUSE.
AND YOU TOLD ME

910
00:40:26.558 --> 00:40:28.159
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE
TO WORRY ANYMORE.

911
00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:29.995
YOU STOOD THERE.

912
00:40:29.995 --> 00:40:32.063
WE ALL THOUGHT QUAD-CARBON
WAS STILL A CLIENT.

913
00:40:32.063 --> 00:40:34.099
WHAT ABOUT US?
WE CAN'T BE THE CLIENT?

914
00:40:34.099 --> 00:40:35.133
LOOK. I REALLY AM SORRY.

915
00:40:35.133 --> 00:40:36.935
IT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION
FOR US. EITHER.

916
00:40:36.935 --> 00:40:40.338
"US"? YOU.

917
00:40:40.338 --> 00:40:41.973
YOU STOOD IN MY KITCHEN.

918
00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:44.810
AND YOU TOLD ME MY
HUSBAND WAS COMING HOME.

919
00:40:46.011 --> 00:40:48.614
QUAD-CARBON
IS OUT OF BUSINESS. OK?

920
00:40:48.614 --> 00:40:51.282

ON K AND R INSURANCE

921
00:40:51.282 --> 00:40:52.651
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

922
00:40:52.651 --> 00:40:54.686

30% OF THAT PACKAGE.

923

LIKE CONFLICT.

924
00:40:55.887 --> 00:40:58.156
PETER DOESN'T
WORK FOR OCTONAL!

925
00:40:58.156 --> 00:41:00.626
THAT'S THE POINT.
THAT'S THE WAY THEY WANT IT.

926
00:41:00.626 --> 00:41:02.227
NO QUAD-CARBON
CONFUSION.

927
00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:05.831
I'M NOT EVEN SUPPOSED
TO TALK TO YOU.

928
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:07.766
SO THIS IS. WHAT.
THIS IS YOU BEING BRAVE?

929
00:41:07.766 --> 00:41:08.967
NO. THIS IS ME
DOING MY JOB.

I CAME BY. THEN.

OFF YOUR CHEST.

GONNA WORK OUT.

EXACTLY THE KIND OF GUY

937
00:41:19.377 --> 00:41:20.411

TO TELL YOU.

AND MY HUSBAND'S DEAD

941

OUT OF THESE BASTARDS.

YOU CAN TELL THE JUDGE

943
00:41:28.654 --> 00:41:30.188
YOU DID EVERYTHING
YOU COULD TO HELP ME OUT?

944
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:33.792
WAIT A MINUTE.

945
00:41:33.792 --> 00:41:36.728

I'M SORRY! I'M S--

I AM TOTALLY BEGGING YOU
TO HELP ME OUT ON THIS.

YOU ASKED ME NOT
TO BULLSHIT YOU. RIGHT?

955
00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.419
