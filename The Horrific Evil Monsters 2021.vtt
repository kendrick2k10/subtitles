3
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.917
It's time…

4
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.792
For the Lamb of God to open.

5
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.500
and Summon us Four.

6
00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:42.250
I am War.

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.375
I have heard your call.

8
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.208
And the world will know us again.

9
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.375
Rise. War.

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.875
And prepare for battle.

11
00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:03.083
For I…

12
00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:06.583
Am Conquest.

13
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.680
um

14
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.333
This is it Sam!

15
00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:05.655
This is the place he was talking about!

16
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.000
Why do we always have to go to these places
you write about in your stupid books?

17
00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:31.208
Did you really think that
the power was still running?

18
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.233
Look. I'm going to go to the car
and grab the air mattress.

19
00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:36.417
Are you sure you want to go to the car?

20
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.792
I mean. maybe I kind of
like the dark in here.

21
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.417
I just can't believe we're here.

22
00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:49.250
You know. they never found him.

23
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.567
What?

24
00:04:50.592 --> 00:04:51.915
Well. they found his face.

25
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.117
Face?

26
00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:54.475
They found his face?

27
00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.675
Uh… what about the rest of him?

28
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.750
Don't worry. Romero. He's not here.

29
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.125
No one is here.
It's just you and me.

30
00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:03.417
Alone.

31
00:05:07.583 --> 00:05:09.958
Ten seconds. I'll be back. I promise.

32
00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.515
You know. I bet you bring all the girls
you like to these creepy death houses.

33
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.917
You caught me there.

34
00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:06.042
Okay. so there's one thing I've been
dying to ask you since we got here.

35
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.167
So are you the hot twin. or did I like…

36
00:06:09.292 --> 00:06:10.292
Ugh!

37
00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:22.347
This is private property!

38
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.150
Move!

39
00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:41.767
Fuck!

40
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.450
Fire!

41
00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:52.222
Canon. get the chains.

42
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.875
Stanley Warner. Bet you haven't
heard that in a while. have you?

43
00:06:58.208 --> 00:06:59.760
It's a pleasure to meet you finally.

44
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.158
You've been on the most wanted
list for quite some time.

45
00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:06.525
I'm really glad it was us
that brought you in.

46
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.083
We have big plans for you.

47
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.192
I'll give you a few
minutes with him. William.

48
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.533
I know that you've
waited a lifetime for this.

49
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.333
He's very heavily sedated.
so you should be okay.

50
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.000
I've spent half my life chasing after you.

51
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.408
You've gotten the best years of my life.

52
00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:32.000
Every night a new nightmare.

53
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.542
And they want to keep you alive.

54
00:07:36.917 --> 00:07:40.250
We both know you're going to escape.

55
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.958
Evil doesn't die.

56
00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:47.667
And it sure as Hell can't be contained.

57
00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:52.042
But this time. I'm ready for you.

58
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.167
Now I am sure that not every murder
in Metsburgh was done by that guy.

59
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.458
Tell that to him.

60
00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:00.250
He almost lost his life to Gore. Twice.

61
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.250
And you want to take Gore back with us?

62
00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:05.875
Yes. Yes I do!

63
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.208
Well. what about him?

64
00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:11.542
Think of it as a game of Cat and Mouse.

65
00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:14.305
This time? The mouse won.

66
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.083
No real need to worry. Old Man.
He's in good hands.

67
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.083
Are you okay. sir?

68
00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:27.375
I'm fine. Problem with the night lately.

69
00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:30.542
So. Who's next?

70
00:08:31.225 --> 00:08:32.225
This man.

71
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.792
Welcome back! Alex Creed. here.

72
00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.675
I'd like to take a minute and
introduce you to my good

73
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.533
friend and confidante Winey Swinney.

74
00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:59.575
She's a world-renowned author.
chef and international food guru.

75
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:05.783
She's here today to talk to you about
her new set of revolutionary kitchen knives

76
00:09:05.908 --> 00:09:07.908
Now I know what you're thinking.

77
00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:12.433
Alex. you've fought zombies. aliens.
and bad guys of all kind

78
00:09:12.558 --> 00:09:13.575
as Devin Danger.

79
00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:17.208
What are you doing with Winey Swinney
talking about kitchen knives?

80
00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:18.958
Well. let me tell you.

81
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.917
When I heard she was in town.
I said to myself…

82
00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:24.595
My fans have got to hear…

83
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.042
About her five-time patented
stainless steel kitchen set.

84
00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:30.458
Now. Winey. what are you
going to make for us today?

85
00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:34.917
Today we're going to make
half-moon squash raviolis!

86
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.708
And we're going to start
with my personal favorite!

87
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.417
The Destroyer!

88
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.208
WINEY: Now Alex…
ALEX: Alrighty then.

89
00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:55.833
Did you know that this knife can
cut through any bone like butter?

90
00:09:57.542 --> 00:10:00.375
Uh. no. I didn't know that Winey.

91
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:08.000
So. we're going to start by
rolling out our full moons.

92
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.958
Like this!

93
00:10:12.667 --> 00:10:15.375
Alright. Okay. folks.

94
00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:18.000
It looks like we're making
lunar eclipse ravioli.

95
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.917
No. Alex!

96
00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:22.542
Lunar means full moon!

97
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.708
And I don't see any werewolves around here!

98
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.125
Do you?

99
00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:31.042
No. no I don't.

100
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:36.958
Today. we're just going to
fold them in to half-moons.

101
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.458
Like this.

102
00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:43.875
Okay. sorry. And it's filled with
wonderful butternut squash.

103
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.042
Yes. what we did was we split the squash!

104
00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:54.208
And then we put in just a little
bit of salt and pepper.

105
00:10:56.333 --> 00:11:00.125
In the words of 'Devin Danger'…

106
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.083
What was that again?

107
00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:07.375
Well. uh. I don't know. Winey.
What line were you referring to?

108
00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:10.917
It's slicing time!

109
00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:15.333
Its… I think you mean…

110
00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:17.075
It's blasting time. The line is…

111
00:11:17.433 --> 00:11:18.475
It's BLASTING TIME!

112
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.317
Oh okay. Close enough.

113
00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:26.250
You know. it was the film where you
were fighting the alien space frogs!

114
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.042
Zombies. It's… It's…
It's Atomic Space Zombies!

115
00:11:34.708 --> 00:11:36.833
Okay. whatever you say!

116
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.083
Now. we're going to take our squash

117
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:46.458
and put it into the oven at
350 degrees for 20 minutes

118
00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:48.958
And. when we're finished…

119
00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:50.967
Vualá!

120
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.750
Little lunar delights!

121
00:11:54.533 --> 00:11:56.658
Well. okay fans. You know what that means.

122
00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:58.167
That means…

123
00:11:58.292 --> 00:12:00.458
Its… BLASTING TIME!

124
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
-Cut!

125
00:12:06.242 --> 00:12:07.922
That was really good.

126
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.292
Really? You again?

127
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.620
Yes. Me again.

128
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.558
And I really wish you and your
friend would reconsider my offer.

129
00:12:17.683 --> 00:12:18.742
My friend?

130
00:12:18.867 --> 00:12:21.617
Why don't you go talk to him yourself?

131
00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:23.750
Look. Mr. Creed. we're running out of time.

132
00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.417
-Sir. You definitely need
to take a look at this.

133
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.625
Is this confirmed?

134
00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:32.792
Yes. sir. The subject was destroyed.
- Shit.

135
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.160
It's time to take a look around and ask
yourself what you're doing with your life.

136
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.625
Okay. like this.

137
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.167
If you change your mind.
you know where to find us.

138
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.120
KIRK: Yeah I've got to go.
All right. see you.

139
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.292
Yeah! Baby!

140
00:13:02.792 --> 00:13:03.850
Good job today!

141
00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:05.792
- Oh yeah?
- Killing it!

142
00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:07.638
What were the numbers?

143
00:13:09.987 --> 00:13:13.807
Well. you know know I don't
seem to have the accurate…

144
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.058
Kirk.

145
00:13:15.283 --> 00:13:16.963
What were the numbers?

146
00:13:18.125 --> 00:13:19.550
Look. Alex.

147
00:13:19.675 --> 00:13:20.675
Man.

148
00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:22.958
Truth be told…

149
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.250
Nobody.

150
00:13:25.125 --> 00:13:29.925
Nobody is looking for Alex Creed selling
kitchen knives on the Food Channel.

151
00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:37.492
WINEY: I'm alright. It's only a little cut.

152
00:13:38.545 --> 00:13:39.545
God.

153
00:13:44.792 --> 00:13:45.792
Alright.

154
00:13:47.045 --> 00:13:48.045
You know…

155
00:13:48.542 --> 00:13:50.942
We need to get you back in the game.

156
00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:54.650
You were one of the highest
paid actors out there.

157
00:13:54.775 --> 00:13:57.396
Commercials trying to
sell kitchen products?

158
00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:00.188
It's not the right route for us to take.

159
00:14:00.458 --> 00:14:02.357
AC. Look up there.

160
00:14:02.482 --> 00:14:03.553
See that shining?

161
00:14:03.678 --> 00:14:04.725
That's YOU!

162
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:06.892
You're a rock star!

163
00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:10.042
Okay? You're not a salesman.

164
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.750
We'll get them again tomorrow.

165
00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:15.415
Go for Lazie.

166
00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:19.847
- Hey. Winey.

167
00:14:20.167 --> 00:14:21.223
I just wanted to…

168
00:14:21.348 --> 00:14:22.348
Alex!

169
00:14:22.833 --> 00:14:24.474
I want you to have this!

170
00:14:24.599 --> 00:14:27.792
It's the new Destroyer 2.0!

171
00:14:28.123 --> 00:14:30.792
Not even in production yet!

172
00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:35.292
And its ten times stronger
than the original!

173
00:14:36.037 --> 00:14:38.500
I want you to have it!

174
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.042
And it even comes with its own holster!

175
00:14:42.458 --> 00:14:46.000
You never know when it's going to be…

176
00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:48.000
Slicing Time!

177
00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:54.167
Gee…

178
00:14:54.383 --> 00:14:55.383
Thanks!

179
00:14:57.887 --> 00:14:58.887
God.

180
00:14:58.917 --> 00:15:00.437
WINEY: I'm alright.

181
00:15:00.928 --> 00:15:02.048
Alright. Alex.

182
00:15:05.292 --> 00:15:07.500
What do you want out of life?

183
00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:26.875
Anna. I'm Mick.

184
00:15:28.529 --> 00:15:30.917
What the Hell is going on here?

185
00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:33.683
Well. why don't I tell you what I do.

186
00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:37.708
I work with an agency
that deals with… Incidents.

187
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.717
Why is that guy wearing a mask?

188
00:15:39.842 --> 00:15:41.724
Well. because you're contagious.

189
00:15:41.849 --> 00:15:42.928
Then where's yours?

190
00:15:43.053 --> 00:15:44.733
Well. I don't need one.

191
00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:46.295
I thought I was contagious?

192
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.420
Not to me.

193
00:15:47.583 --> 00:15:51.334
By the way. I was really impressed with
how you handled yourself back there.

194
00:15:51.459 --> 00:15:52.899
Yeah. well that…

195
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.042
Thing just came at me. like I
was getting ready to close…

196
00:15:56.167 --> 00:15:57.928
And he busted in here and bit me and…

197
00:15:58.053 --> 00:15:59.090
Anna.

198
00:15:59.215 --> 00:16:00.731
I've reviewed your file.

199
00:16:00.856 --> 00:16:02.958
Runaway at thirteen.

200
00:16:03.082 --> 00:16:06.100
Shoplifting. In juvee by fourteen.

201
00:16:06.375 --> 00:16:09.000
Fighting… Grand Theft Auto…

202
00:16:09.458 --> 00:16:12.500
Mercedes S-650?

203
00:16:12.746 --> 00:16:14.402
Excellent choice. by the way.

204
00:16:14.527 --> 00:16:15.621
You were good.

205
00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:17.346
Very good. actually.

206
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.356
But then you got out.

207
00:16:19.481 --> 00:16:20.481
You changed.

208
00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:23.875
Well. at least that's what they told me.

209
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.563
But I knew you could prove them wrong.

210
00:16:26.792 --> 00:16:28.792
Wait… what?

211
00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.667
Who are you?

212
00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:34.050
You see… we're working on this serum.

213
00:16:34.292 --> 00:16:36.425
It brings the dead back to life.

214
00:16:37.136 --> 00:16:38.869
But the problem is that…

215
00:16:39.316 --> 00:16:44.542
The results have been unstable when
administered to the already dead.

216
00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:48.375
So you see… we needed to
test it on the living.

217
00:16:48.792 --> 00:16:50.875
We just needed to find the right subject.

218
00:16:51.842 --> 00:16:52.842
Subject?

219
00:16:53.097 --> 00:16:54.097
Yes.

220
00:16:55.042 --> 00:16:57.714
Someone strong. A fighter.

221
00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:58.839
A survivor.

222
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.987
Someone who could really handle themselves.

223
00:17:03.325 --> 00:17:05.858
And someone who doesn't have any ties.

224
00:17:06.998 --> 00:17:08.958
You don't have any family. do you. Anna?

225
00:17:09.084 --> 00:17:11.550
No one is going to come looking for you.

226
00:17:12.888 --> 00:17:15.832
You see. Anna…
You're going to die.

227
00:17:15.957 --> 00:17:18.185
Look. I don't know what
the Hell is going on here…

228
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.435
Anna. calm down.

229
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.167
Within a few hours. you are
going to be what he was.

230
00:17:23.357 --> 00:17:24.957
Well… not exactly.

231
00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.162
You are going to be something better.

232
00:17:27.287 --> 00:17:28.917
Something stronger. Sharper.

233
00:17:29.584 --> 00:17:30.584
Anna…

234
00:17:30.938 --> 00:17:32.537
You're going to be unstoppable.

235
00:17:32.662 --> 00:17:33.862
Wa… Wa… Wait.

236
00:17:34.201 --> 00:17:35.801
What are you saying?

237
00:17:37.131 --> 00:17:38.131
That…

238
00:17:39.232 --> 00:17:40.352
I'm gonna die?

239
00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:45.928
Think of it more as a rebirth…

240
00:17:46.053 --> 00:17:47.583
A metamorphosis.

241
00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:52.000
You see… we really need you. Anna.

242
00:17:52.678 --> 00:17:54.358
There's a war coming.

243
00:17:54.896 --> 00:17:56.896
And we are going to need you.

244
00:18:07.482 --> 00:18:08.517
Go fish.

245
00:18:09.342 --> 00:18:10.342
Oh. hello.

246
00:18:16.865 --> 00:18:17.865
How you doing?

247
00:18:20.334 --> 00:18:21.334
Alright.

248
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:26.850
Who the Hell are you?

249
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:28.811
Names Alex Creed.

250
00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:30.937
This is my… uh…

251
00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:32.125
My sidekick.

252
00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:33.875
Sidekick?

253
00:18:34.217 --> 00:18:37.928
I would say more of an equally
qualified confidante. wouldn't you?

254
00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:40.157
Whatever. man.

255
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.250
My name is Obji.

256
00:18:45.242 --> 00:18:48.107
And how exactly in the Hell
do you spell that?

257
00:18:48.232 --> 00:18:49.708
O-B-J-I

258
00:18:51.345 --> 00:18:52.732
The "J" is silent.

259
00:18:52.868 --> 00:18:54.168
Wait. what? No.

260
00:18:54.678 --> 00:18:55.678
Yes. it is.

261
00:18:56.792 --> 00:19:00.216
No. I'm pretty sure it sounds like
there's another letter in there.

262
00:19:00.342 --> 00:19:01.379
No.

263
00:19:01.504 --> 00:19:05.058
There's definitely another
letter in there…

264
00:19:05.284 --> 00:19:06.284
Humans.

265
00:19:07.391 --> 00:19:11.500
Okay. look mister O-B-J-I…

266
00:19:12.032 --> 00:19:14.153
How about we just shorten it to "Obie"

267
00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:15.318
Is that cool?

268
00:19:18.786 --> 00:19:19.786
Yo. man.

269
00:19:20.317 --> 00:19:21.317
Sorry.

270
00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:28.125
I used to be a police detective
out of Metsburgh.

271
00:19:29.651 --> 00:19:33.708
I think the reason I've been
brought into this mix is…

272
00:19:33.855 --> 00:19:40.000
That I used to hunt a serial killer that
our friend out there wants.

273
00:19:41.128 --> 00:19:43.500
Hmm. A detective. huh?

274
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.105
You know. I used to be in the military.
Army Corp. two years.

275
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.910
Before I became an actor.

276
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.125
Yeah. he. uh. He likes to read.

277
00:19:52.816 --> 00:19:53.816
A lot.

278
00:19:56.355 --> 00:19:58.621
Sorry I'm late. something came up.

279
00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:00.589
Hey. uh…

280
00:20:00.987 --> 00:20:01.987
You okay. dude?

281
00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:04.350
Yes. Mr. Creed. I'm fine.

282
00:20:04.724 --> 00:20:07.624
But I assume you're wondering
why you're here.

283
00:20:07.756 --> 00:20:08.756
Yeah.

284
00:20:09.201 --> 00:20:13.529
I think I can speak for everybody when I
say what the Hell are we doing here?

285
00:20:13.654 --> 00:20:16.187
Well. each of you has unique abilities

286
00:20:16.542 --> 00:20:22.083
and I'm putting together a team
of extraordinary individuals.

287
00:20:22.803 --> 00:20:24.003
To fight a war.

288
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:25.830
That's coming soon.

289
00:20:26.263 --> 00:20:27.263
A war?

290
00:20:28.048 --> 00:20:30.181
Wait a minute. what type of war?

291
00:20:30.342 --> 00:20:33.286
Dude. I'm just an ex-action hero.
I'm an actor.

292
00:20:33.693 --> 00:20:36.282
I mean. hell. brother. I can't
even do my own stunts.

293
00:20:36.407 --> 00:20:37.883
What can I possibly offer you?

294
00:20:38.008 --> 00:20:40.952
We'll come back to that in
a second. Mr. Creed.

295
00:20:41.204 --> 00:20:44.004
Have any of you heard of "The Apocalypse"?

296
00:20:44.375 --> 00:20:46.492
What. from the Bible?

297
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:47.730
Right.

298
00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:50.708
Hmm.

299
00:20:50.896 --> 00:20:54.529
On my world the apocalypse is
brought on the "Four Riders".

300
00:20:54.654 --> 00:20:56.500
Supreme beings.

301
00:20:56.896 --> 00:21:02.125
They take shape of whatever world
they are trying to consume.

302
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.824
Now normally. the Riders show only
when the world is in need or is dying…

303
00:21:06.949 --> 00:21:07.949
But…

304
00:21:08.119 --> 00:21:12.600
Some have said that when the Riders
show. the Gates of Chaos open…

305
00:21:12.902 --> 00:21:17.542
And those planets beings are
deemed unworthy to live their lives.

306
00:21:18.324 --> 00:21:20.500
They are coming.

307
00:21:24.196 --> 00:21:26.292
Aw. man. This is bullshit.

308
00:21:26.461 --> 00:21:27.581
Man. let's go.

309
00:21:27.875 --> 00:21:31.208
This guy here… I mean this…
This is crazy!

310
00:21:31.438 --> 00:21:33.149
He wants the three of us…

311
00:21:33.274 --> 00:21:34.914
A washed up action hero.

312
00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:36.639
A silent "J" Obji…

313
00:21:37.086 --> 00:21:39.820
And. uh. no disrespect.
but this old dude…

314
00:21:40.086 --> 00:21:43.083
To take on four superhuman Gods.

315
00:21:43.414 --> 00:21:45.814
Who are coming to destroy the world.

316
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.914
I mean we're all going to die.

317
00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:52.094
See? I told you the "J" was silent!

318
00:21:52.219 --> 00:21:54.987
Look. if any of you don't want
to stay. I'll understand.

319
00:21:55.347 --> 00:21:57.792
But time is running short.

320
00:21:58.394 --> 00:22:00.074
They will be here soon.

321
00:22:00.972 --> 00:22:03.208
What if we don't believe this?

322
00:22:03.745 --> 00:22:05.945
Well. you better start believing.

323
00:22:06.261 --> 00:22:08.583
Because they are coming.

324
00:22:10.558 --> 00:22:12.159
If you'll excuse me…

325
00:22:12.284 --> 00:22:13.404
This is crazy.

326
00:22:14.714 --> 00:22:17.658
And just to confirm…
We are removing the "J"?

327
00:22:22.459 --> 00:22:23.459
Oh shit!

328
00:22:23.615 --> 00:22:24.735
You scared me!

329
00:22:25.815 --> 00:22:28.871
Where have you been? I've been
looking for you for like an hour.

330
00:22:28.996 --> 00:22:29.996
Sorry.

331
00:22:30.192 --> 00:22:32.770
The boss is working me to death.

332
00:22:32.895 --> 00:22:34.739
Well. I suppose that's
supposed to be funny.

333
00:22:34.863 --> 00:22:36.222
Look. I really need your help.

334
00:22:36.348 --> 00:22:38.767
You know I can't get involved.

335
00:22:39.342 --> 00:22:42.511
Yeah. he's coming and he's going
to destroy everything in his wake.

336
00:22:42.636 --> 00:22:45.761
You need to understand that
life and death happen.

337
00:22:45.886 --> 00:22:47.186
It's nature's cycle.

338
00:22:47.375 --> 00:22:49.500
After death. there is rebirth.

339
00:22:49.685 --> 00:22:52.435
There are billions of souls on the planet.

340
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.693
Who are they to decide who lives and dies?

341
00:22:54.818 --> 00:22:57.167
They are the Gods.

342
00:22:58.295 --> 00:22:59.295
Gods?

343
00:22:59.592 --> 00:23:02.740
They don't get to tell you to
reap the souls of the living!

344
00:23:02.865 --> 00:23:06.000
You of all people should
know how it works.

345
00:23:06.334 --> 00:23:09.083
Look. I remember when you came for me.

346
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.873
And I didn't want this
any more than you did.

347
00:23:12.998 --> 00:23:14.998
But I'm not you. I'm different.

348
00:23:15.123 --> 00:23:18.568
You are different because you
witnessed the transference of powers.

349
00:23:18.693 --> 00:23:20.701
You are the first of your kind.

350
00:23:20.826 --> 00:23:23.623
And no one knows the
limits of those powers.

351
00:23:23.748 --> 00:23:24.748
Powers?

352
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.510
Does this look like power to you?

353
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.714
Everything I eat tastes like ash.

354
00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:33.167
I can't touch another person.

355
00:23:33.769 --> 00:23:34.769
I can't die.

356
00:23:35.763 --> 00:23:37.043
This is a curse.

357
00:23:37.396 --> 00:23:38.596
It's not power.

358
00:23:39.513 --> 00:23:43.201
You were given your powers for a reason.

359
00:23:43.326 --> 00:23:44.326
Look.

360
00:23:44.763 --> 00:23:45.763
We need you.

361
00:23:46.206 --> 00:23:48.599
Don't you remember
when you used to question?

362
00:23:48.724 --> 00:23:51.708
I no longer remember those days.

363
00:23:51.896 --> 00:23:53.982
I only know of my duty.

364
00:23:54.107 --> 00:23:57.417
There is a list.
A list we follow.

365
00:23:57.623 --> 00:24:01.039
One day. my time too will arrive.

366
00:24:01.164 --> 00:24:02.164
Why can't I breathe?

367
00:24:02.308 --> 00:24:04.241
I told you that would happen.

368
00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:06.917
Your body doesn't need to any more.

369
00:24:07.188 --> 00:24:08.477
Stop fighting it.

370
00:24:08.602 --> 00:24:10.789
You need to understand your fate.

371
00:24:10.914 --> 00:24:12.514
It's coming for you.

372
00:24:12.708 --> 00:24:17.316
The sooner you accept it. the sooner
you can accept your rightful duties.

373
00:24:17.907 --> 00:24:19.580
What about the voices?

374
00:24:19.705 --> 00:24:20.829
The voices I hear.

375
00:24:20.954 --> 00:24:22.554
You hear the voices?

376
00:24:23.141 --> 00:24:26.333
The voices are trapped souls around us.

377
00:24:26.516 --> 00:24:29.333
You must find a way to ignore them.

378
00:24:29.618 --> 00:24:32.792
They are the souls of
those that died suddenly.

379
00:24:33.321 --> 00:24:37.042
Those that haven't finished
their business on this earth.

380
00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:40.417
Never answer those calls.

381
00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.980
Hey!

382
00:25:21.175 --> 00:25:22.681
What do you think you're doing?

383
00:25:22.806 --> 00:25:25.206
Yeah. you. Tough guy with the knife.

384
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.200
You want to go?

385
00:25:27.331 --> 00:25:28.331
Let's go!

386
00:25:31.333 --> 00:25:32.333
Stop!

387
00:25:32.486 --> 00:25:34.100
I am Marcos.

388
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.480
God-Deity.

389
00:25:36.495 --> 00:25:38.417
Spirit. I am Divine.

390
00:25:39.058 --> 00:25:42.292
I am War.

391
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:45.789
-Freeze!

392
00:25:46.368 --> 00:25:48.633
Put your hands up. drop the weapon.

393
00:25:48.758 --> 00:25:51.558
I have a 3-10 in progress. I need back up.

394
00:25:52.008 --> 00:25:53.128
I said freeze!

395
00:25:53.633 --> 00:25:56.667
I've advised him to stop.
He's coming right for me.

396
00:25:56.822 --> 00:25:58.202
I said freeze damn it!

397
00:26:02.602 --> 00:26:06.000
I am Famine!

398
00:26:07.664 --> 00:26:13.083
I am sickness. drought and disease!

399
00:26:13.274 --> 00:26:16.500
And I will make you beg!

400
00:26:58.454 --> 00:27:01.708
Oh no… wait here!

401
00:27:08.735 --> 00:27:10.415
What? The man said wait.

402
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.730
We both knew it was going to come to this.

403
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:47.417
I should have ended this years ago.

404
00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:50.916
You can put the gun down. William.

405
00:27:51.091 --> 00:27:52.091
Trust me.

406
00:27:52.235 --> 00:27:53.235
Trust you?

407
00:27:54.547 --> 00:27:58.707
Look at this thing! You said it can
be controlled and it can't be!

408
00:27:59.008 --> 00:28:00.942
Just go with Doctor Steigert.

409
00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:29.907
Stop!

410
00:28:34.524 --> 00:28:35.524
It works!

411
00:28:37.329 --> 00:28:39.529
You broke my favorite sunglasses.

412
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.922
The serum. Mick. it worked!

413
00:28:42.047 --> 00:28:43.375
Serum? What serum?

414
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.594
Will somebody let me in on this?

415
00:28:45.719 --> 00:28:48.766
You're not the only one
with secrets. Mr. Sanders.

416
00:28:48.891 --> 00:28:49.891
Stanley…

417
00:28:50.407 --> 00:28:51.407
The axe.

418
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.137
You've learned how to control him?

419
00:28:59.472 --> 00:29:00.592
No. detective.

420
00:29:02.365 --> 00:29:04.045
We've weaponized him.

421
00:29:07.951 --> 00:29:08.951
Stanley?

422
00:29:10.146 --> 00:29:11.146
The door.

423
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:32.576
Come along. William.

424
00:29:32.701 --> 00:29:34.768
You're part of the program now.

425
00:29:47.662 --> 00:29:48.662
You know…

426
00:29:49.404 --> 00:29:50.684
Our friend here?

427
00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.850
He's quite resilient.

428
00:29:55.414 --> 00:29:56.934
We're not sure why.

429
00:29:58.118 --> 00:30:01.583
But we did know if we
could slow him down…

430
00:30:03.533 --> 00:30:05.413
We could control him.

431
00:30:05.597 --> 00:30:08.977
That's not what you said before.
you said "weaponized".

432
00:30:09.102 --> 00:30:11.274
Control is the ultimate weapon. Obji.

433
00:30:11.399 --> 00:30:13.532
Stanley. we have a gift for you.

434
00:30:13.904 --> 00:30:18.320
It's not the highest tech. but it
should suit your purposes perfectly.

435
00:30:38.016 --> 00:30:41.500
We're also going to need
you to be using this.

436
00:30:46.779 --> 00:30:49.860
Seems like we can leave the
good doctor to her work now.

437
00:30:49.985 --> 00:30:51.185
What about him?

438
00:30:52.157 --> 00:30:54.079
- I think he's going to be okay.
- And her?

439
00:30:54.204 --> 00:30:56.774
Oh she's definitely going to be okay.

440
00:30:56.899 --> 00:30:57.899
Alright.

441
00:31:13.058 --> 00:31:16.833
There will be a price to pay.

442
00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:22.250
once the God's realize
what we have started.

443
00:31:23.292 --> 00:31:24.492
Brother Famine.

444
00:31:25.792 --> 00:31:28.875
There fell a great star from above.

445
00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.500
Burning like a torch.

446
00:31:32.769 --> 00:31:36.542
And it fell upon this city.

447
00:31:38.347 --> 00:31:41.917
And the name of the star
was: The Apocalypse!

448
00:31:43.982 --> 00:31:45.182
And many men…

449
00:31:45.967 --> 00:31:46.967
Women…

450
00:31:47.928 --> 00:31:49.128
And children…

451
00:31:50.474 --> 00:31:51.474
Will…

452
00:31:52.318 --> 00:31:53.318
Die.

453
00:31:54.771 --> 00:32:01.458
Who are you. Marcos. but a
Horseman that brings war?

454
00:32:03.542 --> 00:32:11.333
You are the mere cathexis.
but not the decider of fate.

455
00:32:12.451 --> 00:32:14.584
While all of us are necessary…

456
00:32:16.131 --> 00:32:21.750
It is I that holds the
key to the Apocalypse.

457
00:32:24.631 --> 00:32:26.833
All your strength…

458
00:32:27.326 --> 00:32:31.500
And yet you can not speak.

459
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:33.951
Hear me.

460
00:32:34.959 --> 00:32:38.208
For I will only say this. but once.

461
00:32:39.667 --> 00:32:43.833
If one falters. we will fail.

462
00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:46.125
Alone…

463
00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:49.000
Our power is strong.

464
00:32:50.282 --> 00:32:51.282
However…

465
00:32:51.813 --> 00:32:53.493
Our power together…

466
00:32:54.383 --> 00:32:55.583
Is unstoppable.

467
00:33:14.485 --> 00:33:16.005
Welcome to the team.

468
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:23.149
Hey. um…

469
00:33:24.118 --> 00:33:26.318
Oh relax. Alex. She's restrained.

470
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.391
Alright. this is it.

471
00:33:34.516 --> 00:33:36.672
This is what I've gathered
you together for.

472
00:33:36.797 --> 00:33:39.454
I was hoping we'd have one
more. but he didn't make it.

473
00:33:39.579 --> 00:33:40.879
Okay. wait a minute.

474
00:33:41.458 --> 00:33:43.692
Who exactly are we supposed to defeat?

475
00:33:43.829 --> 00:33:45.836
That's an excellent question. Mr. Creed.

476
00:33:45.961 --> 00:33:46.961
Well. yeah.

477
00:33:47.077 --> 00:33:50.179
I think we all have a right to know
what we're up against here.

478
00:33:50.304 --> 00:33:53.004
Well. its the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse.

479
00:33:53.774 --> 00:33:55.094
So you were serious before?

480
00:33:55.219 --> 00:33:56.819
- Yeah.
- The Four Horsemen?

481
00:33:57.321 --> 00:33:58.321
Yeah.

482
00:33:58.331 --> 00:33:59.431
- As in Gods?
- M hmm.

483
00:33:59.501 --> 00:34:01.263
- You want us to fight Gods?
- Yeah.

484
00:34:01.388 --> 00:34:02.388
Look.

485
00:34:02.423 --> 00:34:05.853
If I didn't think there's a chance to
beat them I wouldn't ask this.

486
00:34:05.878 --> 00:34:06.878
You've got me…

487
00:34:07.077 --> 00:34:08.804
The walking encyclopedia…

488
00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.529
Books are knowledge!

489
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:12.350
The Unknown Soldier…

490
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.143
This scary "Hannibal" -looking chick…

491
00:34:16.602 --> 00:34:17.602
No offense.

492
00:34:18.305 --> 00:34:22.457
And that big scary motherfucker
that's probably going to kill us all!

493
00:34:22.586 --> 00:34:24.282
We're the only chance we have.

494
00:34:28.042 --> 00:34:30.125
I guess it's a great day to die.

495
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:38.870
-Kora?

496
00:34:42.964 --> 00:34:44.644
-Kora. it's Father David.

497
00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:50.159
I just wanted to check on you.

498
00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:51.956
About…

499
00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:54.730
Earlier.

500
00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.660
I know what happened.

501
00:34:58.771 --> 00:35:00.474
I know what you've been through.

502
00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:02.279
We can talk about it.

503
00:35:05.435 --> 00:35:07.115
It will get better. Kora.

504
00:35:07.818 --> 00:35:10.250
Life gets better.

505
00:35:13.922 --> 00:35:15.602
But this isn't the way.

506
00:35:16.969 --> 00:35:18.409
It's unpardonable.

507
00:35:20.042 --> 00:35:21.722
We belong to the Holy…

508
00:35:22.066 --> 00:35:25.138
And we can not end our
lives unless He wishes so.

509
00:35:27.651 --> 00:35:30.495
Your spirited soul will
not be reaped. but…

510
00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.917
Damned to eternity to replay over
and over again on this plane.

511
00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:39.915
Kora. please.

512
00:35:41.842 --> 00:35:45.542
There is only one decider of your fate.

513
00:35:49.094 --> 00:35:50.094
Well…

514
00:35:51.618 --> 00:35:53.351
Perhaps we can talk later.

515
00:35:55.602 --> 00:35:58.202
Peace be with you. Kora.

516
00:36:11.784 --> 00:36:12.784
So. um…

517
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.409
What's your story. kid?

518
00:36:15.534 --> 00:36:17.167
I'm dead.

519
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:21.511
Oh.

520
00:36:21.776 --> 00:36:22.776
I see.

521
00:36:24.167 --> 00:36:28.903
Well. I'm an ex-action star that does
infomercials on the Cooking Channel.

522
00:36:29.893 --> 00:36:32.888
I see he couldn't put together
a better team. could he?

523
00:36:33.013 --> 00:36:35.250
A better team?

524
00:36:36.178 --> 00:36:38.208
I didn't want to be this.

525
00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:40.625
Whatever this is.

526
00:36:42.506 --> 00:36:44.106
Technically. undead.

527
00:36:44.795 --> 00:36:48.125
Simple. bloodthirsty. undead.

528
00:36:49.217 --> 00:36:51.717
Why do you think you
have to wear the mask?

529
00:36:52.232 --> 00:36:55.708
I assumed it was to protect
my makeup from smearing.

530
00:36:56.476 --> 00:36:57.476
Okay…

531
00:36:57.871 --> 00:36:59.604
I'm going to go find Obji.

532
00:37:00.034 --> 00:37:01.034
Um…

533
00:37:02.792 --> 00:37:03.792
Good talk.

534
00:37:05.606 --> 00:37:06.606
Yeah.

535
00:37:10.155 --> 00:37:11.355
You know. Anna.

536
00:37:11.615 --> 00:37:14.411
I do understand what you're going through.

537
00:37:14.536 --> 00:37:15.536
Do you?

538
00:37:15.804 --> 00:37:19.543
Because I don't see your fucking
flesh rotting off your arms.

539
00:37:19.668 --> 00:37:21.668
Let me tell you a story. Anna.

540
00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:24.016
I didn't always have this job.

541
00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:26.542
I had a life. I had a girlfriend.

542
00:37:28.125 --> 00:37:29.165
Until I died.

543
00:37:29.431 --> 00:37:31.111
What happened to you?

544
00:37:33.115 --> 00:37:34.155
I don't know.

545
00:37:37.375 --> 00:37:40.177
But. whatever happened. changed me.

546
00:37:41.583 --> 00:37:43.580
It turned me into something…

547
00:37:43.705 --> 00:37:45.145
That couldn't die.

548
00:37:45.542 --> 00:37:46.542
Oh. Um…

549
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:52.083
My throat is dry. can I have some water?

550
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.320
You see?

551
00:38:05.838 --> 00:38:07.417
What are you?

552
00:38:08.167 --> 00:38:10.708
Anna. you have power.

553
00:38:11.425 --> 00:38:13.792
You just have to learn how to harness it.

554
00:38:14.292 --> 00:38:15.892
And I can teach you.

555
00:38:19.889 --> 00:38:20.889
Okay. look.

556
00:38:21.631 --> 00:38:23.311
Now that's just great.

557
00:38:23.603 --> 00:38:27.315
Now let's just add cannibal to
our roster of misfit heroes.

558
00:38:28.083 --> 00:38:29.083
Uh…

559
00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:32.083
Cappuccino?

560
00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:35.578
What is this…

561
00:38:36.375 --> 00:38:37.375
Sorcery.

562
00:38:38.038 --> 00:38:39.238
It's a cat toy.

563
00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:40.958
Cat toy?

564
00:38:43.074 --> 00:38:44.454
What is this contraption?

565
00:38:45.542 --> 00:38:47.222
Does it matter. Marcos?

566
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.292
Just a primitive human object.

567
00:38:50.565 --> 00:38:52.165
We have a job to do.

568
00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:58.750
Why do you fear?

569
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:03.750
Ahh. yes.

570
00:39:06.042 --> 00:39:07.833
I can sense it.

571
00:39:08.208 --> 00:39:11.875
You fear the end.

572
00:39:14.858 --> 00:39:17.208
What is this?

573
00:39:17.333 --> 00:39:18.708
That's Teddy.

574
00:39:19.137 --> 00:39:20.958
Teddy?

575
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:26.083
What is a Teddy?

576
00:39:26.917 --> 00:39:31.750
He's my best friend.

577
00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:36.325
Your best friend?

578
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:39.907
Don't you have a best friend?

579
00:39:43.938 --> 00:39:45.917
I don't.

580
00:39:46.833 --> 00:39:51.121
You know. someone you like. Someone
that's there when you need them?

581
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Yes!

582
00:39:56.708 --> 00:40:03.250
Starvation! Malnutrition! Epidemic!

583
00:40:04.208 --> 00:40:08.375
You humans must hate me.

584
00:40:08.922 --> 00:40:09.922
Death.

585
00:40:10.068 --> 00:40:11.748
Finish these mortals.

586
00:40:19.773 --> 00:40:21.453
We've got to keep moving.

587
00:40:23.481 --> 00:40:25.414
Try to bring me to my demise.

588
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.083
With your small beast.

589
00:40:38.417 --> 00:40:39.777
- Whoa!

590
00:40:42.122 --> 00:40:43.314
Alex. a little help?

591
00:40:43.439 --> 00:40:45.972
Now that's some badassery right there!

592
00:40:47.583 --> 00:40:48.583
Woo!

593
00:40:48.739 --> 00:40:50.179
What in the world?

594
00:40:50.326 --> 00:40:51.326
Gentlemen.

595
00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:55.491
My name is Doctor Victor Nat. I'm
the weapons specialist at this facility.

596
00:40:55.524 --> 00:40:57.154
I have just one rule:

597
00:40:57.279 --> 00:40:59.146
Do not put holes in my wall!

598
00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.871
That should really come
with a warning label.

599
00:41:01.996 --> 00:41:02.996
Yeah.

600
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.344
Alright. That's enough practice.

601
00:41:05.849 --> 00:41:08.049
We've got ourselves a Code Green.

602
00:41:09.083 --> 00:41:10.207
How big is that. What?

603
00:41:10.332 --> 00:41:12.544
I missed that one. what's
a Code Green again?

604
00:41:12.669 --> 00:41:14.323
I think it means the food is ready.

605
00:41:14.448 --> 00:41:15.820
Thank God. I'm starving.

606
00:41:15.945 --> 00:41:17.678
A Code Green is not lunch.

607
00:41:19.417 --> 00:41:21.328
Obji. you don't have to raise your hand.

608
00:41:21.453 --> 00:41:24.507
When do we get to eat? Is
that before the mission?

609
00:41:24.632 --> 00:41:26.438
We can eat when we get back!

610
00:41:26.563 --> 00:41:28.463
- He did that.
- Yes. Obji?

611
00:41:28.667 --> 00:41:31.882
When you picked us up you said
we could eat as soon as we got here.

612
00:41:32.007 --> 00:41:34.100
I'm in the mood for the wings of a chicken?

613
00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.674
- Chicken wings.
- Chicken wings!

614
00:41:35.799 --> 00:41:37.625
Chicken wings sounds good right now.

615
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:41.167
A Code Green is an emergency.
We need to go now!

616
00:41:41.674 --> 00:41:43.042
Um. sir…

617
00:41:43.333 --> 00:41:45.690
- Perhaps a last meal is in order.
- You did that.

618
00:41:45.815 --> 00:41:47.517
I'm not getting in trouble for that.

619
00:41:47.642 --> 00:41:51.917
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
are descending upon us. Now.

620
00:41:52.583 --> 00:41:54.885
This is what you came together for.

621
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.811
This is the whole…
Victor get the van!

622
00:41:57.936 --> 00:41:59.049
- Yes sir.
- Van?

623
00:41:59.174 --> 00:42:00.214
Ride? A ride?

624
00:42:00.448 --> 00:42:02.583
Oh. my man Victor!

625
00:42:02.708 --> 00:42:04.981
After that? Let me guess!

626
00:42:05.106 --> 00:42:09.625
We've got some cool superhero type.
weapons automatic type stuff right?

627
00:42:10.139 --> 00:42:11.953
I mean like 100 miles per hour. right?

628
00:42:12.078 --> 00:42:13.078
No…

629
00:42:13.278 --> 00:42:16.062
We have a 1983 GMC Vandura.

630
00:42:16.186 --> 00:42:18.176
What you talking about. Victor?

631
00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:21.294
The Finance Department didn't
want to provide funds…

632
00:42:21.435 --> 00:42:24.002
They are not exactly
expecting us to come back…

633
00:42:24.127 --> 00:42:26.060
I had to bring my personal vehicle.

634
00:42:26.982 --> 00:42:28.539
Yay. van?

635
00:42:28.664 --> 00:42:29.704
Man. shut up.

636
00:42:29.986 --> 00:42:33.954
It does have low miles. so if we
survive we could use it again.

637
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.160
An 80's van. huh?

638
00:42:41.807 --> 00:42:43.740
Couldn't even get a cool car!

639
00:42:48.598 --> 00:42:50.038
Where is everyone?

640
00:42:50.333 --> 00:42:51.933
Whenever they are…

641
00:42:52.292 --> 00:42:53.713
They're all naked?

642
00:42:53.838 --> 00:42:55.405
I don't think they're naked.

643
00:42:55.611 --> 00:42:56.651
They're here.

644
00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:58.330
Were here.

645
00:42:58.892 --> 00:42:59.892
Are here.

646
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.600
They knew we were coming.

647
00:43:13.333 --> 00:43:17.721
Hybrid. Why are you here?

648
00:43:17.846 --> 00:43:19.667
I'm here for her.

649
00:43:19.979 --> 00:43:20.979
Ahhh!

650
00:43:22.287 --> 00:43:25.000
She's the deliverance of fate.

651
00:43:25.568 --> 00:43:28.664
You do not wish to challenge fate.

652
00:43:28.789 --> 00:43:32.167
For you do not yet know yours!

653
00:43:52.124 --> 00:43:55.625
He who seeks me shall find me!

654
00:43:56.250 --> 00:44:01.208
And shall find their fate
is not what they expected.

655
00:44:03.626 --> 00:44:05.500
Child.

656
00:44:06.861 --> 00:44:09.583
I shall give you what you need!

657
00:44:12.971 --> 00:44:14.833
Be free!

658
00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:17.750
Feed!

659
00:44:20.387 --> 00:44:23.833
Is this the hybrid they speak of?

660
00:44:24.708 --> 00:44:28.125
More like half-breed!

661
00:44:28.433 --> 00:44:30.583
You are nothing.

662
00:44:30.945 --> 00:44:34.542
Your powers are nothing.

663
00:44:35.698 --> 00:44:39.667
You can not stop the
events from taking place!

664
00:44:40.163 --> 00:44:41.958
We are the Horsemen.

665
00:44:42.213 --> 00:44:44.042
Destruction of all.

666
00:44:44.508 --> 00:44:50.625
And we will reap your soulless body
as an homage to our testament.

667
00:44:53.292 --> 00:44:56.492
The consequences of breaking
the Alliance is death!

668
00:44:56.897 --> 00:44:58.959
He is Death.

669
00:44:59.084 --> 00:45:00.684
- No!

670
00:45:01.139 --> 00:45:03.042
No. Go away!

671
00:45:03.183 --> 00:45:05.504
He wasn't supposed
to listen to the voices!

672
00:45:05.629 --> 00:45:08.500
I told you to never listen to the voices.

673
00:45:10.899 --> 00:45:13.542
This is not the time. nor the place.

674
00:45:13.904 --> 00:45:17.833
The end is near. but it shall
not take place here.

675
00:45:18.573 --> 00:45:25.375
We shall return when the moon is
high and the time for reaping is full.

676
00:45:30.707 --> 00:45:35.208
You have seen the
fulfillment of your powers.

677
00:45:35.977 --> 00:45:39.042
You were never the reaper of souls.

678
00:45:39.619 --> 00:45:44.067
But. the savior of lost ones.

679
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.625
He was my friend.

680
00:46:04.373 --> 00:46:06.053
But. you can have him.

681
00:46:06.879 --> 00:46:09.250
If you need a friend too.

682
00:46:47.943 --> 00:46:51.143
I'm sorry. Doctor. I'll be out
of here in a moment.

683
00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:53.308
No. I'm sorry to disturb you.

684
00:46:54.507 --> 00:46:55.507
Who are you?

685
00:46:55.683 --> 00:46:57.361
Just a concerned citizen.

686
00:46:57.486 --> 00:46:59.086
A concerned citizen?

687
00:46:59.421 --> 00:47:02.321
Well. a concerned citizen
from a higher power.

688
00:47:02.877 --> 00:47:04.110
Where's the doc?

689
00:47:04.235 --> 00:47:05.390
She stepped out.

690
00:47:05.515 --> 00:47:07.248
Why don't you have a seat?

691
00:47:08.682 --> 00:47:11.015
So. what did happen to you. anyway?

692
00:47:11.242 --> 00:47:13.375
Heard you had a miraculous cure.

693
00:47:13.652 --> 00:47:15.332
Stage Three. wasn't it?

694
00:47:15.917 --> 00:47:18.451
Is there anything I can help you with?

695
00:47:18.634 --> 00:47:19.674
We found him.

696
00:47:20.202 --> 00:47:21.202
Him?

697
00:47:22.053 --> 00:47:24.645
Yeah. what was it the papers called him?

698
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:25.770
Gore?

699
00:47:26.875 --> 00:47:28.653
Why are you telling me this?

700
00:47:28.778 --> 00:47:31.706
I think you know exactly why
I'm telling you. Mr. Sanders.

701
00:47:31.831 --> 00:47:33.647
We want you to help us find him.

702
00:47:33.772 --> 00:47:35.132
What if I refuse?

703
00:47:35.455 --> 00:47:36.455
You won't.

704
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:38.690
You see…

705
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.553
I'm seeking out individuals
that have unique abilities.

706
00:47:41.678 --> 00:47:44.078
And he seems like someone
that we would be…

707
00:47:44.225 --> 00:47:45.905
- We?
- Very interested in.

708
00:47:46.206 --> 00:47:48.500
Yes. I represent a group.

709
00:47:48.669 --> 00:47:51.753
A group of individuals that
have unique abilities.

710
00:47:51.878 --> 00:47:55.299
And an unstoppable killer seems
to fit into that perfectly.

711
00:47:55.424 --> 00:47:57.667
There's also a spot in there for…

712
00:47:57.792 --> 00:48:00.525
An old man by day and a monster by night.

713
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.200
I'm shutting this operation down.

714
00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:32.842
Oh. great.

715
00:48:32.968 --> 00:48:34.754
Another gig I get fired from.

716
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.026
And I wasn't even being paid for this one.

717
00:48:37.204 --> 00:48:39.583
- What about?
- They're no longer your concern.

718
00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:43.308
Well I didn't even finish my question.
I could have been asking anything!

719
00:48:43.433 --> 00:48:46.409
Wait a minute. They weren't our
concern in the first place.

720
00:48:46.538 --> 00:48:48.751
Yet here we are.
And who the Hell are you?

721
00:48:48.879 --> 00:48:50.816
I'm the contingency plan.

722
00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.417
This was Mick's team. His baby.

723
00:48:54.714 --> 00:48:57.480
He put everything he had into the project.

724
00:48:57.605 --> 00:48:58.885
Into all of you.

725
00:49:00.057 --> 00:49:01.741
Mick was wrong.

726
00:49:01.866 --> 00:49:03.213
Alright. hold up.

727
00:49:03.338 --> 00:49:04.938
Mick believed in us.

728
00:49:05.141 --> 00:49:07.948
Now. I don't know who
you are. Mrs. Unknown…

729
00:49:08.073 --> 00:49:10.779
But you can't just walk in
here and shut us down.

730
00:49:10.904 --> 00:49:14.333
Mick did believe in you.

731
00:49:16.433 --> 00:49:19.958
He was wrong about how to defeat them.

732
00:49:20.375 --> 00:49:22.581
It's over. We don't need them.

733
00:49:22.706 --> 00:49:23.986
We do need them.

734
00:49:24.846 --> 00:49:27.458
I remember a long time ago.

735
00:49:27.622 --> 00:49:31.313
Someone telling me that I was
the brightest in the business.

736
00:49:31.438 --> 00:49:33.250
That I would go places.

737
00:49:33.824 --> 00:49:36.292
Or don't you remember that life?

738
00:49:39.583 --> 00:49:42.625
Uh. excuse me. We're still here.

739
00:49:43.698 --> 00:49:47.333
Mick thought that by defeating Conquest…

740
00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:50.017
He could rid the world of destruction.

741
00:49:52.333 --> 00:49:54.208
But that is not it.

742
00:49:54.732 --> 00:49:57.500
They feed off each other.

743
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:01.250
No offense.

744
00:50:04.329 --> 00:50:07.167
What we will need is a diversion.

745
00:50:07.792 --> 00:50:09.592
Something to separate them.

746
00:50:09.912 --> 00:50:13.583
Without each other. they are powerless.

747
00:50:16.417 --> 00:50:18.217
Tonight will bring the end.

748
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:19.810
We must prepare.

749
00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.417
Tonight marks the full harvest.

750
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.875
Tonight we need all of us.

751
00:50:28.417 --> 00:50:31.000
They will meet at the Tomb of Cyrus

752
00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:35.167
For the ritual to bring
upon the Apocalypse.

753
00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:39.958
Hm. Then. I guess we better get going.

754
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.542
The Tomb of Cyrus.

755
00:50:48.792 --> 00:50:49.912
I led the way.

756
00:50:50.438 --> 00:50:51.958
I enter first.

757
00:50:55.292 --> 00:50:59.417
Why must it always be I
to remind you. Marcos.

758
00:50:59.867 --> 00:51:01.625
You are War.

759
00:51:01.982 --> 00:51:04.708
The instigator of anarchy and chaos.

760
00:51:05.059 --> 00:51:06.739
You are brute strength.

761
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.667
But a leader you are not.

762
00:51:09.879 --> 00:51:10.879
Step aside.

763
00:51:11.748 --> 00:51:13.833
Who are you. Olcay?

764
00:51:15.816 --> 00:51:19.169
You await the completion of our work.

765
00:51:19.873 --> 00:51:22.881
And then you mount your
white horse of Conquest.

766
00:51:23.448 --> 00:51:26.208
A mere pawn of the Gods.

767
00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:31.708
Taking credit for the
destruction we create.

768
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:34.850
Must I remind you…

769
00:51:35.888 --> 00:51:41.208
That the Sword of War is
the instrument of your death!

770
00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:47.333
To imprison you back to your resting place.

771
00:51:51.017 --> 00:51:52.877
Talk. talk. talk!

772
00:51:53.358 --> 00:51:56.494
You talk too much! The
Apocalypse will never come!

773
00:51:58.292 --> 00:51:59.292
This way!

774
00:52:12.508 --> 00:52:14.519
A Reaper is not the only traveler.

775
00:52:14.644 --> 00:52:16.324
Where did you get that?

776
00:52:17.292 --> 00:52:19.158
We have our secrets as well.

777
00:52:20.417 --> 00:52:23.667
Once every four thousand years…

778
00:52:23.815 --> 00:52:27.655
The Harvest Moon aligns with
Eros and Elos. forming a portal.

779
00:52:28.268 --> 00:52:32.500
Allowing mortals to travel as
the Reapers have for centuries.

780
00:52:34.625 --> 00:52:37.833
But. I can't promise your return.

781
00:52:39.625 --> 00:52:43.545
Well. you wanted a team of freak shows.

782
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.333
So let's go.

783
00:52:53.442 --> 00:52:54.970
Where the Hell are we?

784
00:52:55.095 --> 00:52:56.542
We don't have much time.

785
00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.500
They are close.

786
00:52:59.217 --> 00:53:01.284
We need to protect the opening.

787
00:53:01.663 --> 00:53:03.863
If it closes. we can not get out.

788
00:53:06.917 --> 00:53:09.002
Two of you need to stay out here.

789
00:53:09.127 --> 00:53:10.167
Just in case.

790
00:53:10.515 --> 00:53:11.595
- Not it!
- Not it.

791
00:53:12.833 --> 00:53:17.397
Would you rather go in and spend some
more quality time with our Horsemen?

792
00:53:17.522 --> 00:53:20.958
I do not see them sitting
down for a game of Uno.

793
00:53:24.384 --> 00:53:25.384
We got this.

794
00:53:25.583 --> 00:53:28.667
It… Is… Blasting Time.

795
00:53:29.379 --> 00:53:31.579
Aw. man. come on. That's my line.

796
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.280
You just can't…

797
00:53:34.301 --> 00:53:35.301
What the?

798
00:53:35.744 --> 00:53:36.744
Oh shit.

799
00:53:38.274 --> 00:53:39.274
We got this.

800
00:53:39.397 --> 00:53:40.516
Don't worry about it.

801
00:53:40.641 --> 00:53:42.253
We got this covered. man.

802
00:53:42.378 --> 00:53:43.378
Um.

803
00:53:44.355 --> 00:53:45.355
Rain-check.

804
00:53:46.928 --> 00:53:47.928
Yeah.

805
00:53:51.017 --> 00:53:53.884
Don't go getting yourself killed now. boys.

806
00:53:55.042 --> 00:53:56.042
Man.

807
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:02.921
Alex.

808
00:54:03.667 --> 00:54:05.691
Make my day!

809
00:54:05.816 --> 00:54:07.542
Pew! Pew!

810
00:54:08.458 --> 00:54:10.811
Man. I mean seriously.

811
00:54:10.936 --> 00:54:11.936
Oh… um…

812
00:54:13.271 --> 00:54:15.625
You had me at 'hello'!

813
00:54:16.342 --> 00:54:17.342
Oh my god.

814
00:54:17.708 --> 00:54:19.775
Good heavens. That's not right.

815
00:54:20.458 --> 00:54:21.458
You.

816
00:54:22.109 --> 00:54:23.109
Go with her.

817
00:54:23.545 --> 00:54:24.665
Find Conquest.

818
00:54:24.993 --> 00:54:27.593
She will be the leader of the Horsemen.

819
00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:31.125
I need to get to Death.

820
00:54:36.046 --> 00:54:37.917
Say hello to my…

821
00:54:38.125 --> 00:54:39.708
Tiny friend!

822
00:54:40.875 --> 00:54:43.417
Okay. first of all. it's "little".

823
00:54:43.792 --> 00:54:44.912
It's my litt…

824
00:54:45.875 --> 00:54:49.505
Hey guy! Hold up! I changed my
mind. I want to come with you!

825
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:50.750
Little friend?

826
00:54:52.483 --> 00:54:53.483
Alex!

827
00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:54.690
Buddy system!

828
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:10.620
Am I too late?

829
00:55:12.083 --> 00:55:13.167
Just in time.

830
00:55:14.375 --> 00:55:16.055
You'd better suit up.

831
00:55:40.891 --> 00:55:41.891
You!

832
00:55:45.867 --> 00:55:48.292
I am War.

833
00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:50.950
Man or monster.

834
00:55:51.917 --> 00:55:53.833
You are mortal.

835
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.792
What are you. demon child?

836
00:55:58.623 --> 00:56:00.756
You possess something not human.

837
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:04.708
Why do you fight for these weak mortals?

838
00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:07.828
What can life bring you that we can not?

839
00:56:08.905 --> 00:56:10.485
I no longer have life.

840
00:56:16.026 --> 00:56:17.706
I believe as you say…

841
00:56:19.175 --> 00:56:20.175
Uno!

842
00:56:20.708 --> 00:56:22.375
Oh you son of a bitch!

843
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.100
Alright. Silent Jay.

844
00:56:24.276 --> 00:56:25.276
Draw Two.

845
00:56:25.423 --> 00:56:26.423
Wham!

846
00:56:26.563 --> 00:56:27.563
Oh.

847
00:56:49.167 --> 00:56:51.153
Alright. I can't do this any more.

848
00:56:51.278 --> 00:56:52.421
Come on. we're going in.

849
00:56:52.546 --> 00:56:54.613
It hasn't been fifteen minutes.

850
00:56:56.518 --> 00:56:58.785
It's a long fifteen minutes. Come on.

851
00:57:00.269 --> 00:57:03.375
You two need to stay out here.

852
00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:07.417
But I'm Alex Creed
and I do what I want!

853
00:57:07.708 --> 00:57:08.748
Man. come on.

854
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:24.870
Conquest. huh?

855
00:57:26.098 --> 00:57:27.964
Welcome to anger management.

856
00:57:29.884 --> 00:57:30.884
Counselor.

857
00:57:34.457 --> 00:57:36.724
I should have kept my ass outside.

858
00:57:36.875 --> 00:57:37.875
Yee haw!

859
00:57:40.875 --> 00:57:41.875
No!

860
00:57:54.192 --> 00:57:56.074
Now that is Uno!

861
00:57:57.527 --> 00:57:58.527
Yeah it is.

862
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:00.485
Thank you. brother.
Thank you.

863
00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.408
Glad I can be of assistance.

864
00:58:02.633 --> 00:58:03.633
What?

865
00:58:03.791 --> 00:58:04.791
Oh.

866
00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:07.500
Oh my word!

867
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:11.309
Oh!

868
00:58:14.252 --> 00:58:15.292
Make it stop!

869
00:58:15.958 --> 00:58:16.958
Oh she…

870
00:58:18.134 --> 00:58:19.134
Go away!

871
00:58:30.862 --> 00:58:33.596
There has been an alliance for centuries.

872
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:37.000
A code that we followed.

873
00:58:39.832 --> 00:58:40.872
I warned you.

874
00:58:43.133 --> 00:58:46.333
You knew the consequences
of breaking the alliance.

875
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:57.375
All being have their time.

876
00:58:57.724 --> 00:59:00.000
The mortals. The immortals.

877
00:59:00.375 --> 00:59:02.167
Your time has come.

878
00:59:02.363 --> 00:59:04.097
The alliance shall remain!

879
00:59:09.833 --> 00:59:11.917
Death takes many shapes.

880
00:59:12.249 --> 00:59:14.667
And a new Death will rise.

881
00:59:15.044 --> 00:59:16.164
But for now…

882
00:59:18.725 --> 00:59:23.250
Alas. Reaper. As the
last remaining Horsemen…

883
00:59:23.792 --> 00:59:28.042
I humbly beg your mercy.

884
00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:39.292
It is time for you to leave.

885
00:59:40.252 --> 00:59:41.932
Go back to your world.

886
00:59:42.926 --> 00:59:45.583
You have done a service to ours.

887
00:59:46.125 --> 00:59:50.292
A debt that can never be repaid.

888
01:00:01.622 --> 01:00:02.622
Whoa.

889
01:00:03.078 --> 01:00:04.105
Who the hell is that?

890
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:05.230
Is…

891
01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:06.682
Is that William?

892
01:00:07.846 --> 01:00:08.846
- William!
- Oh yeah.

893
01:00:09.092 --> 01:00:10.112
Come here boy.

894
01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:12.350
Come here boy. Come here. William.

895
01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:13.475
Come here.

896
01:00:16.225 --> 01:00:17.225
Oh. Oh!

897
01:00:19.368 --> 01:00:20.523
Wait. Wait. Stop.

898
01:00:20.648 --> 01:00:21.648
Stop!

899
01:00:22.292 --> 01:00:23.332
What are you?

900
01:00:23.839 --> 01:00:26.311
You don't happen to have
a stain stick. would you?

901
01:00:26.436 --> 01:00:27.916
No. I don't. Come on.

902
01:00:28.623 --> 01:00:30.556
This isn't going to come out. Alex.

903
01:00:31.063 --> 01:00:32.063
Ugh.

904
01:00:39.056 --> 01:00:40.673
VICTOR: Is there anyone else?

905
01:00:40.798 --> 01:00:41.798
No. just us.

906
01:00:42.818 --> 01:00:46.517
Cannibal died again. Dead-er…

907
01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:49.333
Gore just kind of took off…

908
01:00:49.678 --> 01:00:51.590
And Mr. Personality just disappeared.

909
01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:52.715
Hmm.

910
01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:55.000
The serum lasts less than an hour.

911
01:00:55.403 --> 01:00:56.455
Oh.

912
01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.855
And the Horsemen?

913
01:00:57.881 --> 01:00:59.081
Problem solved.

914
01:01:04.042 --> 01:01:05.750
The van is just up this hill here.

915
01:01:06.528 --> 01:01:08.208
Again with the van. man?

916
01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:11.483
Well. it does have good gas mileage.

917
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:14.630
Hey.

918
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:19.990
I don't think I need to remind you of the
importance of keeping this to yourself.

919
01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:22.958
You know…

920
01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.983
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

921
01:01:26.108 --> 01:01:27.348
Let's start again.

922
01:01:27.478 --> 01:01:28.478
I'm Alex.

923
01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:29.833
That's Obji.

924
01:01:30.183 --> 01:01:32.666
So instead of calling you Mrs. Unknown…

925
01:01:32.791 --> 01:01:34.471
What's your real name?

926
01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.600
You know…

927
01:01:35.762 --> 01:01:38.083
I think I like Mrs. Unknown.

928
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.400
Yeah.

929
01:01:39.542 --> 01:01:40.542
And…

930
01:01:41.042 --> 01:01:44.523
I think it's time you hear some real shit.

931
01:01:45.884 --> 01:01:47.244
- More shit.
- Yeah.

932
01:01:47.883 --> 01:01:49.483
Mr. Creed. this way.

933
01:01:49.775 --> 01:01:50.809
Great.

934
01:01:50.934 --> 01:01:53.384
Maybe this time I'll get
up to 40 on the freeway.

935
01:01:53.554 --> 01:01:55.683
Hey. Alex. Chicken wings?

936
01:02:04.452 --> 01:02:05.452
Mr. Grey.

937
01:02:06.967 --> 01:02:09.134
There's something you need to see.

938
01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:36.027
Are you sure it's okay?

939
01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:40.752
Oh my God. he's dead. It's totally fine.
I've been up here a bunch of times.

Hey. pretty lady. Don't I know you?

942

Nobody knows me.
