thing is.
I think. to ever happen

you could mention it to him.

284

PATRICK: It. it's a
big thing to just
mention.

285
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:51.725
There are no visuals.
no concept work.

286
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:53.727
Besides we've been
through this...
-Hey. uh...

-Oh. Gibson.

350
00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:26.547
I've looked at your proposal.

351
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.590
-Oh. right.
-Let's be clear.

352
00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:31.051
we're on the world's
fastest ocean liner.

353
00:17:31.635 --> 00:17:35.013
And all you're thinking about
is how to make us go faster.

354
00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:37.432
I like it.
-Yes. Sir. about that...

355
00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:38.809
-Passengers travel
on The Queen Mary

356
00:17:39.268 --> 00:17:41.728
because of two words.
Blue Riband.

357
00:17:42.354 --> 00:17:45.148
Not just an award for fastest
transatlantic crossing.

358
00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:46.483
but a guarantee.

359
00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:48.277
-Evening. gentlemen.
-OFFICERS: Captain.

360
00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:51.446
CARRADINE: So. if our rivals
want the title of
world's fastest.

361
00:17:51.446 --> 00:17:54.783
well. fuel consumption
is the new battle ground.

362
00:17:55.242 --> 00:17:56.535
Not propulsion.

363
00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.581
Slow? Gibson. why haven't you
rung off full ahead?

364
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.500
Yes. Sir. that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

365
00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.961
(elevator music)
TOUR GUIDE: Standing
still would mean

366
00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:08.839
almost certain death
for a project of this magnitude.

367
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.677
So. when the Great
Depression halted
construction for over a year.

368
00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:14.761
a deal was struck

369
00:18:14.887 --> 00:18:17.973
for Cunard to merge
with White Star Line.

370
00:18:18.307 --> 00:18:20.934
Owners of the ill-fated Titanic.

371
00:18:21.351 --> 00:18:24.354
Creating Cunard White Star.

372
00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:29.067
Steam was generated
in massive furnaces.

373
00:18:29.318 --> 00:18:34.323
superheated and passed to engine
at seven-hundred degrees
Fahrenheit.

374
00:18:34.323 --> 00:18:37.868
About four-hundred
pound per square inch. Phew!

375
00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:40.329
Now. I don't mean
to scare y'all.

376
00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:45.042
but this was the scene of an
accident in 1938.

377
00:18:45.042 --> 00:18:47.794
when steam built up
behind an emergency door.

378
00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:50.214
escaped. killing an engineer...
(mobile phone camera clicks)

379
00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:52.090
...shutting down
the main engine.

380
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.261
Guests have since reported
hearing his haunting scream...

381
00:18:56.512 --> 00:18:57.930
-Dad!
...throughout the ship.

382
00:18:58.055 --> 00:18:59.306
(shouts) Hey. Dad!

383
00:18:59.515 --> 00:19:00.516
(ominous music)

384
00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.768
Dad!
(elevator door pings)

385
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.480
(a card flutters to the floor)

386
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.861
(water dripping)

387
00:19:14.947 --> 00:19:17.824
(light jazz music)
(footsteps echoing)

388
00:19:31.421 --> 00:19:32.631
(Lukas breathes heavily)

389
00:19:33.966 --> 00:19:35.008
(elevator door pings)
(high tempo music)

390
00:19:35.008 --> 00:19:35.968
(Lukas groans)

391
00:19:36.844 --> 00:19:38.136
(elevator door slams shut)

392
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:42.599
(tour guide talking
in the distance)
(Lukas panicking)

393
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.059
Dad!

394
00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:47.229
TOUR GUIDE: She survived
head on collisions.

395
00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:51.358
Hitler's relentless
wolf packs and even
a one-hundred-foot rogue wave.

396
00:19:51.358 --> 00:19:53.986
causing many to believe
her blessed.

397
00:19:55.571 --> 00:19:56.780
(pages flipping)

398
00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:00.075
(soft music)

399
00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:11.503
BITTNER: Mrs Calder?

400
00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:13.213
(footsteps approaching)

401
00:20:17.134 --> 00:20:18.635
Mrs Calder.

402
00:20:19.386 --> 00:20:21.805
-Miss.
-Oh. Miss Calder.

403
00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:24.141
Yes. yes. Hello. hello.
(mobile phone drops to floor)

404
00:20:24.141 --> 00:20:25.559
Um. Mr Torres?

405
00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.644
Er. no. er. Charles Bittner.

406
00:20:30.522 --> 00:20:31.648
Are you the historian?

407
00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:34.234
I'm our. er. humble Captain.

408
00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:36.028
(chuckles)

409
00:20:36.278 --> 00:20:40.449
I work directly with Mr Torres.
our historian. You were delayed?

410
00:20:41.158 --> 00:20:42.951
(soft music)
He asked if I'd fill in.

411
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:44.494
Oh. please.

412
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.581
(door opens. closes)

413
00:20:47.581 --> 00:20:48.749
(whispers) Shit.

414
00:20:56.006 --> 00:20:58.926
(elevator pings)
(doors open)

415
00:20:59.343 --> 00:21:00.302
(tense music)

416
00:21:01.261 --> 00:21:02.429
Hello?

417
00:21:05.224 --> 00:21:06.642
(water dripping)

418
00:21:08.977 --> 00:21:10.395
(camera shutter clicks)

419
00:21:14.942 --> 00:21:16.318
(footsteps running)

420
00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:19.321
(metal clanging)

421
00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:30.958
(ominous music)

422
00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:33.210
(woman screaming)

423
00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.840
(ghostly sounds)

424
00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:47.891
(metal door clangs open)
(door closes)

425
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.686
(door locks clang shut)
(siren blares)

426
00:21:50.686 --> 00:21:51.812
CHIEF ENGINEER:
Pipes started shaking.

427
00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:53.063
so I reduced the speed.

428
00:21:53.063 --> 00:21:54.857
-And?
-Problem's coming from in there.

429
00:21:54.857 --> 00:21:56.191
(sizzle)
(chief engineer gasps)

430
00:21:56.984 --> 00:21:58.110
It's hot to the touch.

431
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.820
I wouldn't venture in there.

432
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.698
My guess is cracked steam pipes
and a cocktail of
superheated oil.

433
00:22:02.698 --> 00:22:04.908
That room is probably
700 degrees.

434
00:22:04.908 --> 00:22:06.243
We need to shut her
down. Captain.

435
00:22:06.243 --> 00:22:07.494
Let the engineers do their work.

436
00:22:07.494 --> 00:22:08.704
No.

437
00:22:08.704 --> 00:22:10.330
Reduce speed to 15 knots.

438
00:22:10.455 --> 00:22:13.917
-Captain. it only takes
a spark from...
- All that clatter down here.

439
00:22:13.917 --> 00:22:15.669
you must've lost your hearing.

440
00:22:15.836 --> 00:22:18.255
I said do not stop.

441
00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:21.091
By all means. find
a way to reduce
the pressure and speed.

442
00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:22.134
Gradually.

443
00:22:22.134 --> 00:22:23.969
But do not stop.

444
00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:28.223
And the next time you decide
to slow my ship without
my consent.

445
00:22:28.724 --> 00:22:30.267
I'll leave you at
the nearest port.

446
00:22:30.267 --> 00:22:31.435
Yes. Captain.

447
00:22:31.435 --> 00:22:32.811
(tense music)

448
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:39.610
(seagulls crying)

449
00:22:51.288 --> 00:22:52.664
(footsteps running)

450
00:22:57.461 --> 00:22:58.754
(voices of children talking)

451
00:23:01.965 --> 00:23:03.383
(suspenseful music)

452
00:23:07.888 --> 00:23:08.847
(metal clangs)

453
00:23:12.309 --> 00:23:13.268
H-hello?

454
00:23:15.062 --> 00:23:16.021
(metal turnstile cranks)

455
00:23:24.196 --> 00:23:25.656
(sheet rustles)

456
00:23:25.656 --> 00:23:26.615
(breathing heavily)

457
00:23:37.084 --> 00:23:39.503
Are you lost?

458
00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:41.755
JACKIE: How old are you?

459
00:23:42.506 --> 00:23:43.465
Eight.

460
00:23:44.383 --> 00:23:45.384
JACKIE: Me too.

461
00:23:49.012 --> 00:23:49.972
(camera clicks)

462
00:23:53.225 --> 00:23:54.393
(metal turnstile cranks)

463
00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:56.144
(eerie music)

464
00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.939
(footsteps running)

465
00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:08.991
(water splashing)

466
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:12.411
Hello?

467
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:13.954
JACKIE: Down here.

468
00:24:20.711 --> 00:24:21.712
(tense music)

469
00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:25.340
(camera shutter clicks)

470
00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:36.935
(pages flip)

471
00:24:36.935 --> 00:24:38.896
I didn't know there still was
a ship's Captain.

472
00:24:38.896 --> 00:24:41.481
There is not.
But don't tell anyone.

473
00:24:42.482 --> 00:24:43.442
(scoffs)

474
00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:45.944
I just like the suit.

475
00:24:45.944 --> 00:24:49.823
(Anne chuckles)
So. why a book about
us. exactly?

476
00:24:49.823 --> 00:24:51.575
I am a digital marketing
consultant...
(phone rings)

477
00:24:51.575 --> 00:24:52.993
and my...

478
00:24:52.993 --> 00:24:54.953
...my son is obsessed
with ghost stories.

479
00:24:54.953 --> 00:24:56.955
(phone rings repeatedly)
A little too obsessed
actually and...

480
00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.790
MAN:Bittner. are you there?
(slams phone into cradle)

481
00:24:59.082 --> 00:25:00.834
Well. er. one day
he has this dream
and he says to me.

482
00:25:00.834 --> 00:25:02.920
"Mom. I had a dream
that I was on The Queen Mary."

483
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.880
And I was like.
"Oh. you know. we
should go visit."

484
00:25:05.255 --> 00:25:08.342
And he said.
"No. I had a dream
we lived there."

485
00:25:08.634 --> 00:25:09.843
(laughs)

486
00:25:11.178 --> 00:25:12.262
Not kidding.

487
00:25:12.638 --> 00:25:14.389
And so. you know. it
got me thinking.

488
00:25:14.556 --> 00:25:18.185
um. what about doing a book
from a child's perspective?

489
00:25:18.185 --> 00:25:22.105
-Hmm.
-Exploring the ship
and some of the...

490
00:25:23.315 --> 00:25:24.650
stranger stories.

491
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.195
-Ghost stories?
-Yes. the ghost stories.

492
00:25:29.613 --> 00:25:32.658
And also explore the
ship's rich history

493
00:25:32.658 --> 00:25:35.619
and we could raise awareness
and we could help save it.

494
00:25:37.996 --> 00:25:39.998
I didn't know we needed saving.

495
00:25:40.958 --> 00:25:42.459
Just what I see in the media.

496
00:25:44.586 --> 00:25:45.629
Stories.

497
00:25:46.004 --> 00:25:47.422
Right. Stories.

498
00:25:50.968 --> 00:25:53.095
You know. we're pretty
used to stories
around here.

499
00:25:53.095 --> 00:25:57.391
I mean. people have said we're
a doorway for the dead. (laughs)

500
00:25:57.391 --> 00:26:00.227
And although we're famous
for our fiction.

501
00:26:00.227 --> 00:26:03.021
you know. sometimes facts
can be much stranger.

502
00:26:03.021 --> 00:26:05.148
(tense music)

503
00:26:05.148 --> 00:26:10.737
Did you know in 1942. while. er.
transporting German and
Italian prisoners.

504
00:26:11.113 --> 00:26:13.615
she collided with one of our own
escort ships?

505
00:26:13.782 --> 00:26:18.453
Sank it.
Killing all but 99 of
its 400 sailors.

506
00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:23.375
And she just continued on
with little more than a scratch.

507
00:26:23.375 --> 00:26:24.501
(laughs)

508
00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:26.128
Would you take me on a tour?

509
00:26:27.337 --> 00:26:28.297
(clock chimes)

510
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:31.508
(slow footsteps)

511
00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.639
(exhales)
Beautiful.

512
00:26:37.639 --> 00:26:40.684
Oh. yes. we have exactly
five hundred and ninety-six
working clocks

513
00:26:40.684 --> 00:26:41.727
aboard The Queen Mary.

514
00:26:41.727 --> 00:26:44.479
Wow. Really is a time
machine in here.

515
00:26:45.564 --> 00:26:47.649
We should definitely get
all these details in the book.

516
00:26:47.649 --> 00:26:50.068
Well. the Queen's Salon
was a social hub at night.

517
00:26:50.068 --> 00:26:51.653
Winston Churchill used
to sit over there.

518
00:26:51.653 --> 00:26:53.655
Alfred Hitchcock drank
his martini there.

519
00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:55.699
and Bob Hope wrote his
column over there.

520
00:26:56.116 --> 00:26:57.492
Tourists. they love that.

521
00:26:57.492 --> 00:26:59.745
You know. knowing what
famous people did.

522
00:26:59.995 --> 00:27:00.954
where they went.

523
00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:02.789
Is there anything else
you can show me?

524
00:27:03.582 --> 00:27:05.292
(camera shutter clicking)

525
00:27:08.754 --> 00:27:09.880
(bulb flashes)

526
00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:14.885
(loud footsteps. spurs jangling)

527
00:27:15.219 --> 00:27:16.053
(tense music)

528
00:27:28.857 --> 00:27:29.691
(Lukas panicking)

529
00:27:33.987 --> 00:27:35.447
(camera shutter clicks)

530
00:27:37.241 --> 00:27:39.576
(loud banging. ripping sounds)

531
00:27:40.619 --> 00:27:42.287
(camera shutter clicking)

532
00:27:42.412 --> 00:27:43.956
(dramatic music)

533
00:27:44.998 --> 00:27:46.625
(camera shutter clicking)

534
00:27:47.709 --> 00:27:48.919
(banging)

535
00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:50.003
(camera shutter clicking)

536
00:27:52.005 --> 00:27:53.674
(banging)

537
00:27:55.259 --> 00:27:56.510
(rope pulls)

538
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.344
(banging)

539
00:27:57.469 --> 00:28:00.055
(Lukas screams)
(splash)

540
00:28:00.055 --> 00:28:01.807
(water rippling gently)

541
00:28:04.935 --> 00:28:07.729
(Lukas gasping for air)
(splashing)

542
00:28:07.729 --> 00:28:08.814
(tense music)

543
00:28:09.857 --> 00:28:11.066
(water gurgling)

544
00:28:12.526 --> 00:28:14.278
(dramatic music)

545
00:28:16.864 --> 00:28:17.823
(water lapping gently)

546
00:28:21.118 --> 00:28:23.495
BITTNER: People came here
to enjoy glamour.

547
00:28:23.954 --> 00:28:24.955
They still do.

548
00:28:25.289 --> 00:28:27.207
We host brunch on Sundays.

549
00:28:27.207 --> 00:28:29.209
Wedding receptions.
Corporate parties.

550
00:28:29.418 --> 00:28:31.336
You know. Bar-mitzvahs
and what-not.

551
00:28:32.337 --> 00:28:33.630
Oh. throughout the voyage.

552
00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:37.885
er. those ships marked
The Queen's Mary's
location along the Atlantic.

553
00:28:38.135 --> 00:28:42.681
Unfortunately. they
stopped working
after we permanently
docked in '67.

554
00:28:42.681 --> 00:28:46.226
We could capture these
fascinating details
in a wholly original way.

555
00:28:46.977 --> 00:28:48.770
Well. other people have
taken pictures.

556
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.898
How do you propose
your book will be any different?

557
00:28:51.565 --> 00:28:53.942
The quality of the work
and the story you tell
with the pictures.

558
00:28:53.942 --> 00:28:55.736
that's all very important.
But...

559
00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:57.863
...have you ever thought about
virtual reality?

560
00:28:58.113 --> 00:29:00.240
Imagine taking a tour
of The Queen Mary.

561
00:29:00.699 --> 00:29:02.159
Not as it is now. but...

562
00:29:03.202 --> 00:29:08.207
as it was in. I don't know.
1938 or even 1944.

563
00:29:08.332 --> 00:29:10.000
What would that entail?

564
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.586
On site time. Just the scanning.

565
00:29:12.878 --> 00:29:14.838
The coding we could
do from anywhere.

566
00:29:15.047 --> 00:29:20.427
But we would need to cover...
every inch of the ship.

567
00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:23.555
(ominous music)

568
00:29:24.598 --> 00:29:27.267
You're fucking kidding me?

569
00:29:28.101 --> 00:29:29.269
I'm sorry?

570
00:29:30.604 --> 00:29:32.272
Thank you. Miss Calder.

571
00:29:32.272 --> 00:29:35.317
I'll. er. pass this
along to Mr Torres
and we'll get back to you.

572
00:29:35.317 --> 00:29:36.693
(footsteps receding)

573
00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:37.945
(sighs)

574
00:29:39.488 --> 00:29:40.906
(suspenseful music)

575
00:29:44.159 --> 00:29:46.537
TOUR GUIDE:
Over here is the grand salon

576
00:29:46.537 --> 00:29:49.915
and. er. if you'll
all come this way.
we'll go to our...

577
00:29:49.915 --> 00:29:52.292
(frappe preparation sounds)

578
00:29:52.292 --> 00:29:53.794
(sucking on straw)

579
00:29:57.256 --> 00:29:58.423
(dramatic music)

580
00:29:58.423 --> 00:30:00.092
He seems traumatised.

581
00:30:00.467 --> 00:30:03.679
I just...sorry. I turned around.
he was just gone and I ...

582
00:30:05.305 --> 00:30:06.640
How'd the meeting go?

583
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.058
Fine.

584
00:30:08.058 --> 00:30:10.185
Um. I was thinking.
if this book thing goes well.

585
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.562
maybe we could try again.

586
00:30:11.687 --> 00:30:13.522
Settle down. buy a house.

587
00:30:13.522 --> 00:30:15.941
I'm the only one still
renting at my firm. so...

588
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.654
Does now feel like
the right time
to be talking about this?

589
00:30:21.572 --> 00:30:22.739
All I wanna do is know

590
00:30:22.739 --> 00:30:25.117
that we're thinking
the same thing
for our son.

591
00:30:25.117 --> 00:30:27.828
'Cause Lukas needs stability.
we. we both need stability.
right?

592
00:30:27.828 --> 00:30:29.288
There is no 'we'.

593
00:30:29.288 --> 00:30:31.874
-And he's not your son.
-Come on.

594
00:30:31.874 --> 00:30:33.417
We. we. we raised him together.

595
00:30:33.417 --> 00:30:35.752
You can't just move
to another town
and shut me out.

596
00:30:35.752 --> 00:30:37.838
ANNE: Stop it. it's way overdue
we all moved on.

597
00:30:37.838 --> 00:30:41.049
PATRICK: I. I hear what
you're saying.
but it's a house. not a prison.

598
00:30:41.049 --> 00:30:42.217
(deck creaking)
ANNE: You always made it feel

599
00:30:42.217 --> 00:30:44.052
so God damn permanent.

600
00:30:44.678 --> 00:30:46.722
GWEN: Jackie. darling.

601
00:30:47.181 --> 00:30:49.224
(distorted) If I'm doing that I.
I'm not aware...

602
00:30:49.349 --> 00:30:51.185
GWEN: You mustn't worry.

603
00:30:51.185 --> 00:30:52.644
(quick footsteps)

604
00:30:54.104 --> 00:30:55.731
-...move to another town and...
-We have to move forward.

605
00:30:55.856 --> 00:30:58.025
GWEN: You're going
to a new home.

606
00:30:58.358 --> 00:30:59.943
GHOST VOICE:
(distorted) This is your home.

607
00:31:00.068 --> 00:31:03.572
GHOST VOICE: (distorted)
You die here.
you stay here forever.

608
00:31:05.449 --> 00:31:07.659
(distorted) Honey. are you okay?

609
00:31:07.784 --> 00:31:09.661
GWEN: Wait for us there.

610
00:31:09.661 --> 00:31:11.496
(quickened footsteps)

611
00:31:11.496 --> 00:31:15.167
GWEN: And we'll be
a family again.

612
00:31:15.334 --> 00:31:17.294
We found him. No big deal.

613
00:31:17.294 --> 00:31:19.379
-He's wet.
-Yeah. I can see that.

614
00:31:19.588 --> 00:31:21.340
You know. but otherwise
unharmed.

615
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:23.050
ANNE: (distorted) Come on.
let's get you home and dry.

616
00:31:23.175 --> 00:31:24.468
You poor thing.
(voices talking over)

617
00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:27.638
BITTNER: (distorted)
Miss Calder!
Wait. wait! Miss Calder!

618
00:31:30.265 --> 00:31:32.392
(elevator door closes)

619
00:31:34.728 --> 00:31:37.189
(scream)
(glass smashes)

620
00:31:41.443 --> 00:31:43.111
(phone ringing)

621
00:31:44.112 --> 00:31:46.114
(beep)
BITTNER:Miss Calder?
Charles Bittner.

622
00:31:46.114 --> 00:31:47.157
Good news.

623
00:31:47.157 --> 00:31:49.243
We'd like you and your
family to come back

624
00:31:49.243 --> 00:31:51.161
and work on that exciting
project.

625
00:31:51.745 --> 00:31:54.540
(light jazz music)
Mr Torres thinks
is a great idea.

626
00:31:54.748 --> 00:31:57.668
Luckily. we've renovation
scheduled
this weekend.

627
00:31:57.668 --> 00:32:01.004
so. you'll have the. er.
the entire ship to yourself.

628
00:32:01.713 --> 00:32:05.133
♪Good times are finally back♪

629
00:32:05.634 --> 00:32:09.179
♪ Here to stay and
that's a fact ♪
(happy chatter)

630
00:32:09.596 --> 00:32:12.307
♪Living free again...♪

631
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:16.520
♪Good times are finally back♪

632
00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.938
(Gwen and David chattering)

633
00:32:25.946 --> 00:32:28.448
I'm on the lookout for
my next big star.

634
00:32:28.448 --> 00:32:31.076
She could be right here.
in this room.

635
00:32:31.076 --> 00:32:33.453
you just never know.

636
00:32:36.957 --> 00:32:39.001
(whispering) You
just never know.

637
00:32:41.295 --> 00:32:42.921
(chair scrapes)

638
00:32:43.297 --> 00:32:44.840
Where are you going?

639
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.342
How's he supposed to notice me
if I'm planted to a chair?

640
00:32:47.467 --> 00:32:49.761
I told you. we don't beg. ever.

641
00:32:49.761 --> 00:32:52.181
Well. I say let the
cards decide.

642
00:32:52.181 --> 00:32:53.724
No. we shouldn't draw attention.

643
00:32:54.516 --> 00:32:56.268
What if somebody else questions
and we've to explains things?

644
00:32:56.268 --> 00:32:57.352
-Things?
-Things.

645
00:32:57.352 --> 00:32:59.188
We were offered tickets
to America
and we took 'em.

646
00:32:59.188 --> 00:33:00.606
What's wrong with that?

647
00:33:00.981 --> 00:33:02.941
They paid me to read
their fortune.

648
00:33:03.358 --> 00:33:05.360
I told them they'd die
if they left London.

649
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.445
Who's to say they wouldn't?

650
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.947
That was wrong.
It's not what the cards said.

651
00:33:09.698 --> 00:33:11.491
We were fine in third class.

652
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:14.953
We don't belong there
and neither does she.

653
00:33:17.206 --> 00:33:18.165
(sighs)

654
00:33:22.085 --> 00:33:23.462
Hmm-mm.

655
00:33:23.462 --> 00:33:25.923
Now then. put that in your pipe.

656
00:33:26.465 --> 00:33:29.384
(band continues singing)

657
00:33:37.935 --> 00:33:39.144
(slow footsteps)

658
00:33:41.897 --> 00:33:43.273
(glasses clatter)
(room falls silent)

659
00:33:45.526 --> 00:33:46.652
(Jackie breathes heavily)

660
00:33:50.364 --> 00:33:53.075
(band and chatter continue)

661
00:33:55.452 --> 00:33:57.329
COWGIRL:
Have you seen George's new film?

662
00:33:57.621 --> 00:33:59.206
Oh. it's simply divine.

663
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.500
Hepburn lights up every room.

664
00:34:02.292 --> 00:34:03.836
Including the box office.

665
00:34:04.002 --> 00:34:06.463
I don't know how to compare it
to some of his earlier pictures.

666
00:34:06.755 --> 00:34:10.092
probably not as entertaining as
Two Dinosaurs Meet
While Ice Skating.

667
00:34:10.717 --> 00:34:11.969
But it is just magical.
wouldn't you agree?

668
00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:13.512
Excuse me. Sir.

669
00:34:13.512 --> 00:34:14.888
COWGIRL: Now. you may ask.
what is the distinction between

670
00:34:14.888 --> 00:34:16.264
subject matter and style.

671
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:18.016
-But this is a cinematic...
-I'm a dancer.

672
00:34:18.016 --> 00:34:20.143
-...experiment in style.
-I'd to audition for
your next movie.

673
00:34:21.395 --> 00:34:22.437
What now. my dear?

674
00:34:22.437 --> 00:34:23.522
I'm a dancer.

675
00:34:23.522 --> 00:34:25.607
I'd like to audition for
your next movie.

676
00:34:25.815 --> 00:34:27.693
I'm the star
you've been looking for.

677
00:34:30.696 --> 00:34:32.114
(Viktor clears his throat)

678
00:34:32.114 --> 00:34:35.324
Did your parents not teach you
that it is very rude

679
00:34:35.324 --> 00:34:39.246
to come to a table uninvited?
-Oh. Viktor. Come now.

680
00:34:48.213 --> 00:34:50.090
Good evening. your name please.

681
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.550
Mr and Mrs Howe.

682
00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.219
Frightfully sorry I had
to cancel earlier.

683
00:34:54.511 --> 00:34:56.722
My wife is feeling
much better now.

684
00:34:57.472 --> 00:34:59.099
Is there a table still free?

685
00:35:02.144 --> 00:35:03.103
(jazz singing)

686
00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:09.693
What happened?

687
00:35:12.696 --> 00:35:13.655
Oh.

688
00:35:19.286 --> 00:35:20.579
(chair scrapes)

689
00:35:20.579 --> 00:35:23.081
David.

690
00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:24.875
GINGER: He once asked.
can I give him a scoop?

691
00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:27.586
A scoop. I said. of what
ice cream?!

692
00:35:27.794 --> 00:35:28.962
Well. I'm a sherbet...

693
00:35:28.962 --> 00:35:29.922
Excuse me.

694
00:35:30.797 --> 00:35:32.466
Sir. that's my girl
you just spoke to.

695
00:35:32.466 --> 00:35:34.927
She's. er. just a little upset.

696
00:35:40.974 --> 00:35:42.267
(chair scrapes loudly)

697
00:35:42.267 --> 00:35:43.227
Now...

698
00:35:44.728 --> 00:35:46.688
I apologise that she
interrupted you.

699
00:35:46.688 --> 00:35:49.983
but she wants to be in movies
more than anything and. er...

700
00:35:50.234 --> 00:35:51.902
and now she's just
a little upset.

701
00:35:51.902 --> 00:35:53.862
She's talking about
abandoning her dream.

702
00:35:53.862 --> 00:35:55.489
which upset my wife.

703
00:35:55.489 --> 00:35:57.115
Oh. we're also performers.

704
00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:01.036
Now. she's a dancer.
A very good one.

705
00:36:01.328 --> 00:36:02.412
Better than that Ginger Rogers.

706
00:36:02.412 --> 00:36:04.373
-Oh. she is?
-Oh!

707
00:36:04.373 --> 00:36:07.459
(laughs) You'll be doing
me a big favour
if you just reconsider.

708
00:36:07.459 --> 00:36:09.878
You. you see what see can do.
you won't be sorry.

709
00:36:10.128 --> 00:36:11.964
(jazz singing continues
in background)

710
00:36:19.555 --> 00:36:20.514
(Viktor slurps)

711
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:25.561
(chuckles) Please.

712
00:36:26.395 --> 00:36:27.938
(laughs)

713
00:36:40.158 --> 00:36:41.285
Please.

714
00:36:42.703 --> 00:36:44.580
And who are you?

715
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.957
My thought exactly.

716
00:36:47.916 --> 00:36:49.376
(laughs)

717
00:36:49.376 --> 00:36:51.295
(jazz music crescendo)

718
00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:54.464
BITTNER: Go home.
We'll reschedule.

719
00:36:54.464 --> 00:36:56.341
ANNE: Why would you
invite us here
and then tell us to go home?

720
00:36:56.341 --> 00:36:57.926
Isn't the book from
your son's perspective?

721
00:36:57.926 --> 00:36:59.178
Er. yeah. but...

722
00:36:59.303 --> 00:37:00.929
BITTNER: Well. so he
should be here.

723
00:37:01.096 --> 00:37:03.223
ANNE: It's empty now.
It's the perfect time to do it.

724
00:37:03.348 --> 00:37:07.352
BITTNER: Oh. we refurbish
all the time.
Yeah. tourism is eating
this ship alive.

725
00:37:07.352 --> 00:37:08.937
People come. they take things.

726
00:37:09.188 --> 00:37:11.440
Souvenirs that cost
us a fortune.

727
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.276
You know the worst offender?

728
00:37:14.526 --> 00:37:16.862
I mean. you'll laugh.
(chuckles)

729
00:37:17.029 --> 00:37:18.071
Mould.

730
00:37:18.071 --> 00:37:19.406
-What. mould?
-Hmm.

731
00:37:19.406 --> 00:37:21.700
Such a tiny nuisance. you know.

732
00:37:22.367 --> 00:37:24.786
We got leaking roofs.
dripping air ducts.

733
00:37:24.786 --> 00:37:28.373
sweating plumbing pipes
and all this...damp.

734
00:37:29.249 --> 00:37:31.418
I mean. you wouldn't think it
when you're up there
in the fresh air.

735
00:37:31.418 --> 00:37:33.170
But below deck
is the perfect breeding ground

736
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:36.340
for some really...
nasty organisms.

737
00:37:37.508 --> 00:37:41.053
Which might explain
why your son is sick.

738
00:37:41.053 --> 00:37:43.180
Tell me. did Lukas
mention the ship
when you got home?

739
00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:45.432
He said he left his camera
in the pool area.

740
00:37:45.432 --> 00:37:47.392
-Pool?
-His clothes were wet.

741
00:37:47.392 --> 00:37:49.102
No. pockets of stagnant water.

742
00:37:49.102 --> 00:37:50.312
Poor ventilation.

743
00:37:50.604 --> 00:37:51.647
He said the pool.

744
00:37:51.647 --> 00:37:53.982
When we docked in '67.
the boilers came out.

745
00:37:53.982 --> 00:37:55.567
so did the pool above it.

746
00:37:55.567 --> 00:37:58.403
It was a tragedy. really.
She was a real pearl. But...

747
00:37:59.446 --> 00:38:03.158
Look. er. I know this
isn't the same
without Lukas.

748
00:38:03.617 --> 00:38:05.285
So how about when you come back.

749
00:38:05.285 --> 00:38:08.372
I'll give you a deluxe.
all access. tour.

750
00:38:08.664 --> 00:38:10.082
With me as your guide. yeah?

751
00:38:10.374 --> 00:38:12.835
And. er. this is you.

752
00:38:14.711 --> 00:38:18.298
I had to leave my
very sick son...
at home

753
00:38:19.174 --> 00:38:22.928
in order to come here
because he knows this is. um...

754
00:38:24.346 --> 00:38:25.973
a last chance for us.

755
00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.685
I even had to call my very
unpleasant mother

756
00:38:29.977 --> 00:38:31.353
to ask her to watch him.

757
00:38:31.854 --> 00:38:35.315
And as you can imagine.
I don't like calling
her for anything.

758
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:39.069
We are just not leaving here
empty handed...

759
00:38:40.445 --> 00:38:41.655
Captain.

760
00:38:43.699 --> 00:38:47.202
I am not asking you.
I am begging you.

761
00:38:48.203 --> 00:38:49.162
Okay.

762
00:38:50.706 --> 00:38:51.748
Okay!

763
00:38:52.958 --> 00:38:56.795
But. er. anything below M deck
is restricted.

764
00:38:57.796 --> 00:38:59.965
He's not exactly Captain
material.
is he?

765
00:39:07.973 --> 00:39:10.267
If you don't wanna do this.
I understand.

766
00:39:12.394 --> 00:39:15.022
I'm here. aren't I? (sniffs)

767
00:39:17.191 --> 00:39:18.942
(door beeps. opens)

768

770
00:39:39.421 --> 00:39:41.632
Your mask. Sir. Remove it.

771
00:39:41.632 --> 00:39:43.842
My mask?
What does that have to
do with anything?

772
00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:45.511
There is a special place in hell

773
00:39:46.011 --> 00:39:48.138
for men who impersonate
war heroes.

774
00:39:48.138 --> 00:39:49.348

you claim to be.

778
00:40:01.401 --> 00:40:05.155
Should anything happen
to your father or I. stay here.

779
00:40:07.324 --> 00:40:08.367
Come with me. Sir.

780
00:40:08.367 --> 00:40:09.952
What on earth are you doing?

781
00:40:09.952 --> 00:40:11.703

790
00:40:33.892 --> 00:40:35.686
The plot wasn't very realistic.

791
00:40:35.978 --> 00:40:37.938
Oh. a critic.

792
00:40:38.856 --> 00:40:42.401
This. no doubt. is why
he hides his face.

793

-Yes.
-Hmm.

805
00:41:24.443 --> 00:41:25.777
You were magnificent.

806

we had to lie.

How else is she supposed
to learn
to perform when it counts?

808
00:41:30.741 --> 00:41:33.785
Still. it's one thing to have an
opportunity. it's another
to take it.

809
00:41:33.911 --> 00:41:35.120
(romantic music)
And she will.

810
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.288
With her talent.

811
00:41:36.538 --> 00:41:39.583
she won't need to scrimp
and scrape like we did.

00:41:40.834 --> 00:41:43.712
Every door will be held open.

00:59:11.927 --> 00:59:14.096
because I know this sounds
like it is...

1055
00:59:14.096 --> 00:59:15.639
...but last night I had a dream

1056
00:59:15.639 --> 00:59:17.724
there were police waiting for us
at the port

1057
00:59:17.724 --> 00:59:20.936
and then a few moments
ago downstairs
I tried to give the
maitre d' a tip.

1058
00:59:20.936 --> 00:59:23.105
but when I reached into my bag.
I pulled out this!

1059
00:59:24.565 --> 00:59:25.732
(bang)

1060
00:59:27.192 --> 00:59:28.902
(threatening music)

1061
00:59:34.533 --> 00:59:36.702
-Why do you have that?
-Hmm.

1062
00:59:36.702 --> 00:59:37.661
(keys jangle)

1063
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.538
(slow cello music)

1064
00:59:42.165 --> 00:59:44.334
(David growls)

1065
00:59:46.128 --> 00:59:47.087
I...

1066
00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.549
I'm going to go upstairs
and try and find...

1067
00:59:52.467 --> 00:59:53.594
...Cassandra.

1068
00:59:55.137 --> 00:59:56.638
Perhaps she's waiting
in the playroom.

1069
00:59:57.181 --> 00:59:58.140
DAVID: Stay.

1070
01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:06.940
(creaking)

1071
01:00:11.904 --> 01:00:12.863
(Gwen breathes heavily)

1072

(Gwen chuckles)

1075
01:00:28.545 --> 01:00:29.505
(clanging)

1076
01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:31.340
(rubbing sound)

1077
01:00:42.601 --> 01:00:44.520
Somebody oughta tell them
to keep it down.

1078
01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:50.025
(threatening music)

1079
01:00:52.486 --> 01:00:54.071
(door opens)
(chain jangles)

1080
01:00:55.072 --> 01:00:57.199
Can you please keep it down?

1081
01:00:58.742 --> 01:01:01.078
Or I'll call security.

1082
01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:06.458
(gasps)

1083
01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:13.090

(door creaks open)

1097
01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:45.224
David?

1098
01:02:48.101 --> 01:02:50.062
DAVID: He's with the ship now.

1099
01:02:52.064 --> 01:02:53.232
What does that mean?

1100
01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.318
Show me my husband!

1101
01:02:57.778 --> 01:03:00.948
DAVID: Firstly. put on the mask.

1102
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.950
(breathes heavily)

1103
01:03:12.918 --> 01:03:13.877
(cords swish)

1104
01:03:15.546 --> 01:03:17.214
DAVID: Now take the card.

1105
01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:22.094

1106
01:03:22.302 --> 01:03:24.680
DAVID: The answer

1108
01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:35.899

(sobbing)

1110
01:03:43.991 --> 01:03:45.909
What did you do to my husband?

1111
01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:50.122
DAVID: (scoffs) Your husband.
your husband?

1112
01:03:51.665 --> 01:03:52.791
Please.

1113
01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:56.920

(glass crunching)

1121
01:04:32.873 --> 01:04:36.543
My service to this ship has...
come to an end.

1122
01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:40.172
Thank your family
for me. will you?

1123
01:04:41.507 --> 01:04:44.051
Eight years without sport was...

1124
01:04:45.135 --> 01:04:46.929
...tough.

TORRES:Bittner.
Yeah?

1181
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.354
Will you turn it down?

1182
01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:12.611
(music stops)

1183
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:17.698
It's Torres.

1184
01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:20.202
Yeah?
You're closed for business?

1185
01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:21.578
Yeah.

1186
01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:23.330
Management is concerned.

1187
01:09:23.455 --> 01:09:25.040
Yeah. we're. er...

1188
01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.709
we're renovating.

1189
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:29.795
(chuckles) Must be
a pretty big job?

1190
01:09:30.087 --> 01:09:33.048
Well. it's an emergency.
It's just a couple of days.

1191
01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:37.928
We've creditors crawling
up our ass
threatening to call in loans.

1192
01:09:37.928 --> 01:09:40.013
I mean. do we look
like Disney Land?

1193
01:09:41.723 --> 01:09:45.519
Look. I've been
doing this a long
time. Mr Torres.

1194
01:09:46.019 --> 01:09:49.314
and I'm telling you.
it's better to cut
a problem off at the root.

1195
01:09:49.982 --> 01:09:51.358
What problem?

1196
01:09:55.362 --> 01:09:57.114
Bittner. are you there?

1197
01:09:57.281 --> 01:09:58.448
(Bittner sighs)

1198
01:09:59.658 --> 01:10:00.868
Bittner!

1199
01:10:01.076 --> 01:10:04.705
One of our guests
stole a vessel.

1200
01:10:05.163 --> 01:10:06.373
A lifeboat?

1201
01:10:06.832 --> 01:10:08.208
Er. no.

1202
01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:10.460
Oh?

1203
01:10:11.336 --> 01:10:14.214
A little girl. er.
took one home.

1204
01:10:14.923 --> 01:10:18.051
I called the parents.
requested they return it.

1205
01:10:18.468 --> 01:10:20.387
but they fed me some bullshit.

1206
01:10:21.096 --> 01:10:22.598
Said she wasn't coming back.

1207
01:10:22.598 --> 01:10:25.893
so I need time to find out
what they know and fix it.

1208
01:10:26.018 --> 01:10:29.229
Soon as I'm done.
doors will open.

1209
01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:31.523
Get rid of them.

1210
01:10:32.274 --> 01:10:34.568
I don't think you understand.

1211
01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:36.486
No. no. We agreed.

1212
01:10:36.528 --> 01:10:41.408
You sell The Queen
Mary experience.
tours. merchandise.
churro and whatnot.

1213
01:10:41.533 --> 01:10:43.744
and we ignore whatever
goes on there.

1214
01:10:43.744 --> 01:10:45.996
But if you go and make
an even bigger mess.

1215
01:10:45.996 --> 01:10:47.456
that's a problem.

1216
01:10:47.456 --> 01:10:49.625
Call me tomorrow
when doors are open.

1217
01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:51.168
-And Bittner?
-Yeah?

1218
01:10:51.168 --> 01:10:53.545
You're a security guard.
Don't fucking...

1219
01:10:53.545 --> 01:10:55.672
(phone hangs up)
(upbeat jazz music continues)

1220
01:11:02.513 --> 01:11:04.264
(thunder rumbles)

1221
01:11:07.601 --> 01:11:09.061
(whiskey sloshes)

1222
01:11:09.686 --> 01:11:11.438
Hey. Jesus!
(Anne spits)

1223
01:11:11.438 --> 01:11:13.357
I'll make you a Manhattan later
if you want.

1224
01:11:13.649 --> 01:11:15.526
I think it was the
girl's mother.

1225
01:11:15.817 --> 01:11:17.486
-Ow!
-Yeah. I believe you.

1226
01:11:19.738 --> 01:11:22.241
That wasn't your son
you left with...

1227
01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.701
Our son.

1228
01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:37.965
I know you only stayed
for Lukas.
all these years.

1229
01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:39.007
I know that.
(Anne inhales)

1230
01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:40.342
Wait. wait. please.

1231
01:11:41.635 --> 01:11:42.636
But. um...

1232
01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:47.307
what happens if he is here?

1233
01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.938
(whispers) Then I'll stay.

1234
01:11:57.025 --> 01:11:58.110
(softly) Okay.

1235
01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:04.199
It's just that I don't know
where to find the pool.

1236
01:12:06.994 --> 01:12:07.953
I do.

1237
01:12:09.997 --> 01:12:11.373
I think we're done here.

1238
01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:14.543
(light switch clicks)

1239
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:17.963
(telephone ringing)

1240
01:12:26.763 --> 01:12:28.599
Anne. Captain Bittner here.

1241
01:12:28.599 --> 01:12:30.642
(exhales) Oh. hello.

1242
01:12:31.018 --> 01:12:33.020
I'm sorry. the power is down.

1243
01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.230
This whole place is a death trap
when it rains.

1244
01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:36.273
Look. I called maintenance.

1245
01:12:36.273 --> 01:12:38.150
but they said they won't be here
until tomorrow.

1246
01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:39.484
I mean. "Tomorrow?" I said.

1247
01:12:39.484 --> 01:12:41.570
"We've guests working on
a special project."

1248
01:12:41.695 --> 01:12:45.616
They apologised and all.
but tomorrow's the
best they can do.

1249
01:12:45.616 --> 01:12:46.700
We brought torches.

1250
01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:47.826
Yeah. if it was up to me.

1251
01:12:47.826 --> 01:12:49.453
I wouldn't care
if you looked around.

1252
01:12:49.453 --> 01:12:51.205
but it's an insurance
risk. you know.

1253
01:12:51.205 --> 01:12:53.457
Those guys. they're
a pain in the ass.
you understand?

1254
01:12:53.457 --> 01:12:54.833
ANNE: We'll be careful.

1255
01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:56.543
Yeah. no doubt.
Still. we shouldn't
take any risks.

1256
01:12:56.543 --> 01:12:58.128
Let's reschedule. I insist.

1257
01:12:58.253 --> 01:13:00.506
Pour yourself a drink.
I'll come get you.

1258
01:13:00.881 --> 01:13:02.883
We'll walk to your cabin.
collect your stuff.

1259
01:13:03.342 --> 01:13:06.345
And. er. I can tell
you about the time
Walt Disney and I smoked cigars

1260
01:13:06.345 --> 01:13:08.931
in the bar until the
wee hours. Huh?

1261
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:12.184
ANNE: Okay. Captain. (sighs)

1262
01:13:12.726 --> 01:13:14.603
(phone rings off)
We gotta go.

1263
01:13:14.603 --> 01:13:15.729
You know what?

1264
01:13:16.396 --> 01:13:17.856
Think I will have that drink.

1265
01:13:18.899 --> 01:13:21.068
(smashing. screaming)

1266
01:13:21.068 --> 01:13:22.694
(high tempo music)

1267
01:13:24.321 --> 01:13:25.572
Hell are you going?

1268
01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:26.698
(drawer opens)

1269
01:13:28.075 --> 01:13:29.076
(gun cocks)

1270
01:13:29.284 --> 01:13:30.369
(bullets clang)

1271
01:13:30.786 --> 01:13:32.913
(barrel spins)
(junior engineer screaming)

1272
01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:35.832
(crewmen chattering)

1273
01:13:37.835 --> 01:13:40.212
CREWMAN: Go! Clear!

1274
01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:41.672
-JUNIOR ENGINEER: My face!
-CREWMAN: Move!

1275
01:13:41.672 --> 01:13:43.048
-JUNIOR ENGINEER: My face!
-Wait!

1276
01:13:43.173 --> 01:13:44.758
CREWMAN: Make way
for the Captain!

1277
01:13:46.093 --> 01:13:47.845
(junior engineer whimpers)
CARRADINE: Give it here.

1278
01:13:50.722 --> 01:13:53.141
Not...my...swally!

1279
01:13:53.141 --> 01:13:54.476
CARRADINE: Easy. easy!

1280
01:13:57.271 --> 01:13:59.439
Go. Go!

1281
01:14:12.077 --> 01:14:13.704
Oh God. oh God.

1282
01:14:14.288 --> 01:14:15.664
(tense music)

1283
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.751
(machine whirring)

1284
01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:28.927
(steam blows)

1285
01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:30.387
Captain.
(Carradine gasps)

1286
01:14:30.387 --> 01:14:31.847
(hip flask clangs)
Gibson! Bloody hell.

1287
01:14:36.143 --> 01:14:38.937
Forward generator burned out.
All the flood doors are closing.

1288
01:14:39.354 --> 01:14:40.814
Shall we contact New York?

1289
01:14:40.814 --> 01:14:42.399
The navy? I mean.
maybe they have a craft
in the area.

1290
01:14:42.399 --> 01:14:44.151
No. no. Just.
just...(chuckles)...

1291
01:14:44.151 --> 01:14:46.820
just tell them
it's part of tonight's
entertainment.

1292
01:14:47.362 --> 01:14:48.322
Sir?

1293
01:14:48.572 --> 01:14:50.032
-Why aren't you upstairs?
-Well. I was.

1294
01:14:50.032 --> 01:14:51.992
But an incident occurred
with one of the passengers.

1295
01:14:51.992 --> 01:14:54.620
-Well. take care of it.
-There's been a murder.

1296
01:14:54.786 --> 01:14:56.496
(dramatic music)

1297
01:15:03.128 --> 01:15:05.088
(quickened footsteps)

1298
01:15:08.008 --> 01:15:09.176
David Ratch.

1299
01:15:09.176 --> 01:15:11.553
Travelling third class
with his family.

1300
01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:14.890
Appears Mr Ratch lost his senses
some time after dinner.

1301
01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:17.434
Found him covered in
his wife's blood
trying to launch a life vessel.

1302
01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:19.394
Took three men to restrain him.

1303
01:15:19.394 --> 01:15:20.771
He's in the infirmary now.

1304
01:15:21.313 --> 01:15:22.773
Bloody hell.
how did they get down here?

1305
01:15:22.773 --> 01:15:24.483
DRUNK GUEST: Captain!
Why's she so slow this
evening. huh?!

1306
01:15:24.483 --> 01:15:26.109
Party's upstairs. gentlemen.

1307
01:15:26.109 --> 01:15:27.861
-DRUNK GUEST: Are we sinking?!
-Alright. alright. That'll do.

1308
01:15:27.861 --> 01:15:30.781
The fastest ship. my
arse. (laughing)

1309
01:15:32.115 --> 01:15:33.283
CARRADINE: Where is Mrs Ratch?

1310
01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:34.952
Cabin B-474.

1311
01:15:34.952 --> 01:15:37.079
Apparently. he did
it with an axe.
Made a frightful mess.

1312
01:15:37.204 --> 01:15:39.540
They have a young daughter.
Our people are trying
to locate her.

1313
01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.959
She was last seen leaving
the grand salon by herself.

1314
01:15:41.959 --> 01:15:43.418
approximately eight thirty.

1315
01:15:43.418 --> 01:15:45.212
(people chattering)

1316
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:51.426
GUEST: How dare you make a joke
about my wife?!

1317
01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:52.469
CLOWN: I wasn't...
(glass smashes)

1318
01:15:52.469 --> 01:15:53.679
(guests gasp)

1319
01:15:54.805 --> 01:15:56.431
Sir. respectfully.
why are we here

1320
01:15:56.431 --> 01:15:57.891
and not at the scene
or on the bridge?

1321
01:15:58.183 --> 01:15:59.726
I needed to see for myself.

1322
01:16:00.394 --> 01:16:02.354
Clock stopped at seven.

1323
01:16:02.729 --> 01:16:05.065
Same time you reported
the accident downstairs.

1324
01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:07.192
The prisoner say anything?

1325
01:16:07.526 --> 01:16:08.485
Well. like what?

1326
01:16:08.777 --> 01:16:10.612
Other than the obvious crazy?

1327
01:16:11.113 --> 01:16:13.323
Was there anything
that stood out?

1328
01:16:13.615 --> 01:16:15.450
Well apparently. his
friends call him
Clarky.

1329
01:16:15.784 --> 01:16:17.953
Thought it was a bit odd
for someone with the
surname Ratch.

1330
01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:21.498
He then used some rather
choice words
to indicate how the
officer could

1331
01:16:21.498 --> 01:16:23.834
use a 'so-and-so' and insert it.

1332
01:16:24.418 --> 01:16:25.961
-A cigarette?
-(chuckles) No.

1333
01:16:27.045 --> 01:16:28.881
-Have you a cigarette. Gibson?
-Oh.

1334
01:16:30.549 --> 01:16:32.134
(tinkling music)

1335
01:16:32.509 --> 01:16:34.261
It must be time to send an SOS.

1336
01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:38.682
Have you witnessed
a ship go down?

1337
01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:41.560
No.

1338
01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:43.687
I have.

1339
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:46.982
My father did everything
he could.

1340
01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.485
Gave the order within
plenty of time.

1341
01:16:52.529 --> 01:16:53.906
People get scared.

1342
01:16:55.365 --> 01:16:58.452
They panic...and
fight like rats.

1343
01:16:59.661 --> 01:17:01.705
I won't let that happen
on this ship.

1344
01:17:02.372 --> 01:17:04.082
Not while we can still save her.

1345
01:17:04.708 --> 01:17:06.168
Well. shall I report
to the bridge and...

1346
01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:08.795
coordinate our resources
from there?

1347
01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.923
(scoffs)

1348
01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:12.966
You don't understand.

1349
01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:16.386
Our only concern now

1350
01:17:17.554 --> 01:17:18.972
is Mr Ratch.

1351
01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:23.685
(lilting piano music)

1352
01:17:42.496 --> 01:17:43.789
(Anne breathes heavily)

1353
01:17:51.588 --> 01:17:53.382
LADY IN WHITE:
Frightfully sorry to bother you.

1354
01:17:54.508 --> 01:17:56.927
But I'm supposed to
meet my husband in New York.

1355
01:17:57.177 --> 01:17:59.680
And the captain said
I can't disembark.

1356
01:18:01.056 --> 01:18:04.977
If you see my husband.
can you send him a message?

1357
01:18:05.853 --> 01:18:08.021
(cries) I need...
(head clangs on piano keys)

1358
01:18:08.021 --> 01:18:09.356
Oh!

1359
01:18:12.609 --> 01:18:14.319
(piano music continues)
...to leave...

1360
01:18:14.319 --> 01:18:15.821
(head clangs on piano keys)

1361
01:18:15.946 --> 01:18:17.573
...this...
(head clanging on piano keys)

1362
01:18:17.698 --> 01:18:20.117
...ship...
(head bashing piano)

1363
01:18:21.076 --> 01:18:23.704
I need to leave this ship.
I need to leave this ship!

1364
01:18:23.704 --> 01:18:28.125
(shouts) I need to
leave this ship!
I need to leave this ship!

1365
01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:33.881
I need to leave this ship!
I need to leave this ship!

1366
01:18:34.047 --> 01:18:37.342
I need to leave this...!

1367
01:18:37.342 --> 01:18:39.469
(door beeps. opens)

1368
01:18:42.973 --> 01:18:44.725
(tense music)

1369
01:18:45.225 --> 01:18:47.102
(shoes squeaking)

1370
01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:08.832
(wind whistling)

1371
01:19:09.082 --> 01:19:11.376
PATRICK: The pool.
It's below M deck.

1372
01:19:13.003 --> 01:19:15.589
Bittner. you sneaky
little prick.

1373
01:19:15.964 --> 01:19:17.591
(banging on wall)

1374
01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.930
(softly) Shit.

1375
01:19:23.514 --> 01:19:26.058
It's all wet. Even the scanner.

1376
01:19:26.225 --> 01:19:28.143
This'll need time to dry.

1377
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:41.323
Friend of Bittner's. you think?

1378
01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:45.661
(clears throat)

1379
01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:53.210
You know. I thought
if we did this project together.

1380
01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:56.129
you and Lukas would come home
and we'd be...

1381
01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.258
a...a kind of family again.

1382
01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:02.177
But honestly. the last
thing I expected

1383
01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:06.098
was to get your answer
before we even started.

1384
01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.225
So. I. I guess...

1385
01:20:10.018 --> 01:20:11.770
how come I wasn't enough?

1386
01:20:12.896 --> 01:20:13.856
ANNE: Oh no.

1387
01:20:14.565 --> 01:20:16.149
No. no. that's not what it is.

1388
01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:18.151
I just don't believe
in marriage.

1389
01:20:18.819 --> 01:20:20.028
I failed once.

1390
01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.492
(softly) I still want to escape.

1391
01:20:26.410 --> 01:20:29.872
It's just that the urge
to be with Lukas is stronger.

1392
01:20:36.712 --> 01:20:38.338
You know. if you stay here.

1393
01:20:39.923 --> 01:20:42.593
you'll get trapped
like that shrieking woman.

1394
01:20:42.718 --> 01:20:44.219
(ominous music)

1395
01:20:45.554 --> 01:20:49.641
You'll end up as a footnote
in one of Bittner's
haunted tours.

1396
01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:52.227
A historical curiosity.
nothing more.

1397
01:20:57.357 --> 01:20:58.317
Patrick.

1398
01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:00.068
Yeah?

1399
01:21:00.736 --> 01:21:03.030
I can't leave my son alone here.

1400
01:21:08.619 --> 01:21:09.745
Fine.

1401
01:21:10.204 --> 01:21:12.998
We can be the dead family
still walking the deck.

1402
01:21:16.919 --> 01:21:18.795
(smashing)
(high tempo music)

1403
01:21:28.555 --> 01:21:30.849
(Bittner breathing heavily)

1404
01:21:37.731 --> 01:21:39.107
(smashing continues)

1405
01:21:47.574 --> 01:21:50.202
(vomits)
(smashing)

1406
01:21:59.002 --> 01:22:02.214
(David breathes heavily)

1407
01:22:07.636 --> 01:22:09.429
Ugh. that smell.

1408
01:22:12.891 --> 01:22:15.394
(dramatic music crescendo)

1409
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:24.653
(flare sizzles)

1410
01:22:28.699 --> 01:22:30.409
(dead bolt slides closed)

1411
01:22:35.414 --> 01:22:39.126
(Jackie screaming. sobbing)

1412
01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.840
(kicks door open)

1413
01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:48.135
(siren blaring in
the background)

1414
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:51.346
(heavy breathing)

1415
01:22:58.979 --> 01:23:00.355
(distant banging)

1416
01:23:02.691 --> 01:23:04.526
(tense music)

1417
01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:38.393
(high tempo music)

1418
01:23:49.029 --> 01:23:51.114
Motherfuckers!

1419
01:23:55.327 --> 01:23:57.412
(echoing footsteps)

1420
01:23:59.915 --> 01:24:01.959
(ominous music)

1421
01:24:19.101 --> 01:24:20.853
(water dripping)

1422
01:24:24.481 --> 01:24:27.609
(flashback sounds)

1423
01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:31.905
Look.

1424
01:24:33.532 --> 01:24:35.450
He's still here. Patrick.

1425
01:24:36.827 --> 01:24:38.704
(Anne sobs)

1426
01:24:53.844 --> 01:24:54.970
(doors open)

1427
01:25:01.768 --> 01:25:07.232
Oh. God. Oh. God. Oh. God.
(Jackie wheezing)

1428
01:25:14.364 --> 01:25:16.408
(Jackie exhales her
final breath)

1429
01:25:16.408 --> 01:25:18.243
(soft violin music)

1430
01:25:21.788 --> 01:25:22.956
(door opens)

1431
01:25:23.207 --> 01:25:24.666
(siren blares in background)

1432
01:25:40.849 --> 01:25:42.267
Oh. Christ.

1433
01:25:42.476 --> 01:25:45.103
(David yells)
(fighting. slashing. spurting)

1434
01:25:47.773 --> 01:25:49.566
GIBSON: Send the distress code.

1435
01:25:49.566 --> 01:25:52.444
CARRADINE: It won't
make a difference.
don't you see?

1436
01:25:52.444 --> 01:25:56.281
The man roaming freely
is why the ship is faltering.

1437
01:25:57.366 --> 01:25:58.534
(beeping)

1438
01:25:58.867 --> 01:26:00.869
(door creaks open)

1439
01:26:06.708 --> 01:26:07.835
Hello?

1440
01:26:09.545 --> 01:26:10.963
Miss Calder?

1441
01:26:15.425 --> 01:26:17.594
(water running)

1442
01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:21.640
Are you alright in there?

1443
01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.058
(door creaks open)

1444
01:26:24.601 --> 01:26:27.145
(gunfire)

1445
01:26:27.271 --> 01:26:28.355
(door kicks open)

1446
01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:33.360
(dramatic music)

1447
01:26:46.498 --> 01:26:48.333
(homeless man gasping)

1448
01:26:49.751 --> 01:26:51.295
Oh. fuck!

1449
01:26:51.295 --> 01:26:52.921
(curtain door swishes)
(gunfire)

1450
01:26:52.921 --> 01:26:54.006
(curtain hooks snap)

1451
01:26:54.006 --> 01:26:55.048
(camera snaps open)

1452
01:26:58.302 --> 01:27:00.721
PATRICK: Wow. he used
the whole roll.

1453
01:27:01.096 --> 01:27:02.222
Be careful.

1454
01:27:12.733 --> 01:27:14.735
PATRICK: I need to know
what Bittner's hiding.

1455
01:27:15.444 --> 01:27:18.405
(whirring. static)

1456
01:27:20.866 --> 01:27:22.326
ANNE: Is that it?

1457
01:27:23.535 --> 01:27:24.703
Damn.

1458
01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.830
I've never seen a doorway to...

1459
01:27:27.956 --> 01:27:29.041
...fuck knows.

1460
01:27:33.795 --> 01:27:34.838
Anything?

1461
01:27:39.301 --> 01:27:42.387
Is that a...child?

1462
01:27:44.473 --> 01:27:45.557
No.

1463
01:27:47.184 --> 01:27:49.520
No. judging by the size.
I'd say an adult.

1464
01:27:50.646 --> 01:27:51.980
And it's in the structure.

1465
01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:53.774
so probably from the time
the ship was built.

1466
01:27:54.191 --> 01:27:56.485
Also. there's no way
they could put the metal
poles in there

1467
01:27:56.485 --> 01:27:58.362
after pouring the concrete.
Which...

1468
01:27:59.530 --> 01:28:01.365
...which tells me the workers
knew about it.

1469
01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.202
Or they did it.
(tense music)

1470
01:28:05.327 --> 01:28:10.958
CARRADINE: After Wall
Street tumbled in
'29. Clydebank shipyard
closed its doors.

1471
01:28:12.209 --> 01:28:15.420
While this vessel was
just bare bones.

1472
01:28:17.756 --> 01:28:21.134
The ship spent three long years
overlooking that town.

1473
01:28:21.134 --> 01:28:22.177
Like a coffin.

1474
01:28:22.845 --> 01:28:24.388
As if they needed reminding

1475
01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:27.933
what would happen if her future
couldn't be secured.

1476
01:28:29.643 --> 01:28:31.728
Then with the nation's
pride at stake.

1477
01:28:32.604 --> 01:28:35.315
the British Government
stepped in
with a financial commitment.

1478
01:28:35.315 --> 01:28:36.608
to guarantee completion.

1479
01:28:38.193 --> 01:28:40.946
With Clydebank's
future at stake.

1480
01:28:41.947 --> 01:28:43.365
the workers stepped in.

1481
01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:46.159
To guarantee her success.

1482
01:28:47.619 --> 01:28:49.580
And that of future generations.

1483
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:51.748
(crowds shouting)

1484
01:28:52.165 --> 01:28:54.418
Crime locks many doors.

1485
01:28:57.796 --> 01:28:59.173
But for one prisoner.

1486
01:29:00.591 --> 01:29:02.050
it required...

1487
01:29:03.927 --> 01:29:05.179
sacrifice.

1488
01:29:05.179 --> 01:29:07.556
PATRICK: Foundation sacrifice.
to be exact.

1489
01:29:08.849 --> 01:29:11.226
According to an old engineering
tradition.

1490
01:29:11.393 --> 01:29:13.061
to guarantee structural
integrity.

1491
01:29:13.061 --> 01:29:15.606
one ought to bury a human
inside of the walls.

1492
01:29:15.856 --> 01:29:17.900
And the more pain he suffers.

1493
01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:21.695
the greater the bind...

1494
01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:24.740
...between his spirit...

1495
01:29:25.616 --> 01:29:26.825
and the ship.

1496
01:29:27.534 --> 01:29:30.120
Until both are inseparable.

1497
01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:39.129
The workers selected
their victim.
Edward Clark.

1498
01:29:39.129 --> 01:29:41.590
Or Clarky as he was
known to them.

1499
01:29:42.174 --> 01:29:46.720
A riveter and former inmate.
rumoured to have murdered.

1500
01:29:47.638 --> 01:29:51.433
They inflicted on him
the most miserable of ends.

1501
01:29:51.683 --> 01:29:53.602
(burning. screaming)

1502
01:29:53.602 --> 01:29:55.604
His sacrifice protected them.

1503
01:29:55.604 --> 01:29:57.314
(hammering. screaming)

1504
01:29:57.314 --> 01:29:58.732
(choral music)

1505
01:30:04.863 --> 01:30:07.741
Gave them the success
and peace of mind

1506
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:09.785
they so badly craved.

1507
01:30:14.039 --> 01:30:15.499
ANNE: That's a real thing?

1508
01:30:15.707 --> 01:30:17.251
What. foundation sacrifice?

1509
01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:19.336
Yeah.

1510
01:30:19.336 --> 01:30:21.588
Well. it's not exactly
on the curriculum at university.

1511
01:30:21.588 --> 01:30:23.048
but yeah. sure.

1512
01:30:23.632 --> 01:30:25.676
From time-to-time cases
have occurred.

1513
01:30:25.968 --> 01:30:27.427
I mean. it's an open secret.

1514
01:30:27.594 --> 01:30:29.972
Even kids' rhymes are about it.

1515
01:30:30.138 --> 01:30:32.266
London Bridge keeps
falling down until...

1516
01:30:32.266 --> 01:30:34.810
ANNE: Until they lock
a man inside.
(distant thunder)

1517
01:30:34.810 --> 01:30:37.563
PATRICK: Yeah.
Folklore based on
a grain of truth.

1518
01:30:38.605 --> 01:30:40.274
My God. that is barbaric.

1519
01:30:40.732 --> 01:30:42.985
And you actually believe
we're unsinkable?!

1520
01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:48.115
PATRICK: Might explain
how the ship
survived a World War

1521
01:30:48.907 --> 01:30:51.326
a dozen botched face lifts.

1522
01:30:51.952 --> 01:30:53.120
a rogue wave.

1523
01:30:55.330 --> 01:31:00.794
rTo reinstate the ship's power.
we must reinstate Mr Clark.

1524
01:31:01.503 --> 01:31:04.882
and kill whatever
flesh he is in.

1525
01:31:04.882 --> 01:31:06.258
(music crescendo)

1526
01:31:09.595 --> 01:31:11.597
(siren continues
in the distance)

1527
01:31:18.312 --> 01:31:19.605
Should we fail...

1528
01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.026
...your question as to whether
this ship is unsinkable...

1529
01:31:24.526 --> 01:31:25.527
(clanging)

1530
01:31:26.904 --> 01:31:29.281
...will most certainly
be answered.

1531
01:31:30.532 --> 01:31:31.867
(dramatic music)

1532
01:31:33.243 --> 01:31:34.453
(gasps)

1533
01:31:35.204 --> 01:31:36.163
Oh. my God!

1534
01:31:37.331 --> 01:31:39.583
Oh. my fucking God.

1535
01:31:41.877 --> 01:31:44.046
Shit!
(running footsteps)

1536
01:31:45.088 --> 01:31:46.507
(ghostly sounds)

1537
01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:48.592
Lukas?!

1538
01:31:48.592 --> 01:31:49.635
Patrick!
(clicking)

1539
01:31:49.635 --> 01:31:50.719
I see him.

1540
01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:52.471
-Baby. come back!
-Wait!

1541
01:31:52.888 --> 01:31:54.765
(water dripping)
(horrifying music)

1542
01:31:57.309 --> 01:31:58.977
(static interference)

1543
01:32:02.606 --> 01:32:03.815
(banging)

1544
01:32:08.445 --> 01:32:09.530
PATRICK: Anne!

1545
01:32:12.866 --> 01:32:14.409
(breathing heavily)

1546
01:32:19.289 --> 01:32:21.959
(radio bleeps)
Anne? Are you there?

1547
01:32:22.167 --> 01:32:23.377
(Anne gasping)

1548
01:32:23.627 --> 01:32:24.962
(high tempo music)

1549
01:32:32.135 --> 01:32:35.472
ANNE: Patrick. come in! Patrick.

1550
01:32:35.472 --> 01:32:36.431
Yeah. I'm here.

1551
01:32:39.268 --> 01:32:41.854
I followed Lukas to an elevator.
but he's gone.

1552
01:32:42.354 --> 01:32:43.397
Where are you?

1553
01:32:44.398 --> 01:32:45.357
(sighs)

1554
01:32:45.607 --> 01:32:48.944
I don't know. er.
cabin numbers are E-100s.

1555
01:32:49.111 --> 01:32:50.362
PATRICK: (distorted)
Okay. stay where you are...

1556
01:32:51.113 --> 01:32:52.239
(tense music)

1557
01:33:05.210 --> 01:33:07.212
(clanging. ping)

1558
01:33:18.098 --> 01:33:23.437
(eerie music)
(ghostly voices)

1559
01:33:38.118 --> 01:33:40.037
(clanging. hammering)

1560
01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:50.881
(fast footsteps)

1561
01:33:51.298 --> 01:33:52.799
(high tempo music)

1562
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:56.261
(door opens)
(siren blares)

1563
01:34:03.143 --> 01:34:04.937
CARRADINE: Clear the
way. coming through!

1564
01:34:05.687 --> 01:34:06.897
Keep moving. upstairs.

1565
01:34:06.897 --> 01:34:08.273
And follow the safety orders.

1566
01:34:13.695 --> 01:34:14.863
Where is it?

1567
01:34:15.739 --> 01:34:17.950
(door unlocks. opens)

1568
01:34:28.836 --> 01:34:29.837
(rifle opens)

1569
01:34:37.886 --> 01:34:39.054
Come on!

1570
01:34:41.014 --> 01:34:42.224
(rifle cocks)

1571
01:34:45.185 --> 01:34:46.270
Keep moving!

1572
01:34:46.395 --> 01:34:48.063
Out of the way! Coming through!

1573
01:34:52.067 --> 01:34:53.610
(ghostly shouting)

1574
01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:54.778
(tense music)

1575
01:34:57.865 --> 01:34:59.658
(creaking)

1576
01:35:17.467 --> 01:35:19.887
WOMAN: You're not from
here. are you?
(doors opening)

1577
01:35:23.515 --> 01:35:26.560
I'm sorry. excuse
my impertinence.

1578
01:35:27.895 --> 01:35:29.354
-LUKAS: Mum?
-WOMAN: Stay with us. please.

1579
01:35:29.479 --> 01:35:30.522
ANNE: Lukas?
(ghostly chatter)

1580
01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:31.899
WOMAN: If you wish to stay.

1581
01:35:32.107 --> 01:35:34.109
y- y- you could take my place!

1582
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:36.403
(laughs) I really don't mind!

1583
01:35:36.904 --> 01:35:39.823
MAN: It's wonderful.
wonderful fun!

1584
01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.658
WOMAN: And I could leave...

1585
01:35:42.618 --> 01:35:44.661
(distorted) just for
a little while.

1586
01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:46.330
WOMAN: You don't understand!

1587
01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:47.748
I've been here for so long!

1588
01:35:47.748 --> 01:35:49.374
WOMAN: I promise.
I'll come back.

1589
01:35:49.374 --> 01:35:50.876
None of this is real.

1590
01:35:51.668 --> 01:35:53.879
-None of this is real.
-MAN: need your body!

1591
01:35:53.879 --> 01:35:55.422
MAN: But I need you more!

1592
01:35:55.839 --> 01:35:57.591
WOMAN: (angry)
Why should you go and not me?!

1593
01:35:57.591 --> 01:35:59.718
MAN: Fuck me.
People are waiting for me!

1594
01:35:59.968 --> 01:36:02.179
WOMAN: Please! I'm begging you!

1595
01:36:02.179 --> 01:36:03.347
Lukas!

1596
01:36:03.347 --> 01:36:04.473
WOMAN: Where are you?!

1597
01:36:06.642 --> 01:36:08.268
MAN: Give me your body!

1598
01:36:08.268 --> 01:36:10.020
(Anne breathes heavily)
(ghostly screaming continues)

1599
01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:12.314
MAN: I must get off
of this boat!

1600
01:36:14.691 --> 01:36:15.984
Stop!

1601
01:36:16.902 --> 01:36:18.403
Where are you?

1602
01:36:22.908 --> 01:36:24.993
I thought you'd gone home.

1603
01:36:28.455 --> 01:36:29.540
Er...

1604
01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.959
yeah. we got lost
on the way out.

1605
01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:38.257
Have you seen Anne anywhere?

1606
01:36:38.966 --> 01:36:40.092
No.

1607
01:36:45.013 --> 01:36:46.056
Who's that?

1608
01:36:46.348 --> 01:36:47.683
That's nobody.

1609
01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.894
(Patrick breathes heavily)

1610
01:36:50.894 --> 01:36:51.854
You sure?

1611
01:36:52.479 --> 01:36:53.438
Yeah.

1612
01:36:56.775 --> 01:36:58.235
So. so that...

1613
01:36:58.652 --> 01:37:00.362
that's not her on the trolley?

1614
01:37:01.196 --> 01:37:02.281
Oh. him?

1615
01:37:03.407 --> 01:37:05.200
No. it's just. er...

1616
01:37:07.119 --> 01:37:11.790
just some vagrant I caught.
er. sneaking around.

1617
01:37:16.545 --> 01:37:17.754
Okay.

1618
01:37:18.797 --> 01:37:20.424
Okay.

1619
01:37:20.424 --> 01:37:23.051
Er. we. we found the
swimming pool.
by the way.

1620
01:37:23.051 --> 01:37:25.554
You're right. she's.
she's a. she's a pearl.

1621
01:37:26.221 --> 01:37:29.558
And the. er. little brat
who absconded in your
son's place?

1622
01:37:29.558 --> 01:37:31.018
She told us everything.

1623
01:37:33.645 --> 01:37:35.814
Now. I was hoping you'd. er.
return with her.

1624
01:37:35.814 --> 01:37:39.276
so I could give you back
your son.

1625
01:37:39.693 --> 01:37:41.904
(Patrick coughs. sniffs)

1626
01:37:42.404 --> 01:37:43.822
We left instructions.

1627
01:37:43.864 --> 01:37:45.908
If we don't walk out
of here tomorrow.
call the cops.

1628
01:37:45.991 --> 01:37:48.243
Tell them everything. Okay?

1629
01:37:48.493 --> 01:37:53.707
So even if that was true.
who'd believe her stories?

1630
01:37:53.832 --> 01:37:58.629
Well. actually.
a lot of people would.

1631
01:37:59.755 --> 01:38:02.549
Whatever secrets you've kept
hidden down here.

1632
01:38:02.549 --> 01:38:03.759
Lukas saw.

1633
01:38:04.134 --> 01:38:05.427
Okay. he saw them.

1634
01:38:07.763 --> 01:38:08.889
Give that to me.

1635
01:38:09.014 --> 01:38:10.390
No. No. no. no.

1636
01:38:10.682 --> 01:38:13.852
Not until we're safely
off the ship.

1637
01:38:14.937 --> 01:38:16.230
(high tempo music)
(gun cocks)

1638
01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:18.273
(gunshot)
(Patrick groans)

1639
01:38:18.774 --> 01:38:20.984
(door opens. closes)

1640
01:38:23.904 --> 01:38:25.239
(people screaming)

1641
01:38:25.239 --> 01:38:27.866
Move. move. move!
Where's that boy?

1642
01:38:31.662 --> 01:38:32.996
Clarky!

1643
01:38:33.997 --> 01:38:35.165
(siren wails)

1644
01:38:39.837 --> 01:38:41.129
(tannoy chimes)

1645
01:38:42.297 --> 01:38:45.259
As we approach
the next stop of our tour.

1646
01:38:45.384 --> 01:38:47.719
we are reminded in these
hallowed halls

1647
01:38:47.719 --> 01:38:51.056
of how insignificant
we really are.
(breathes heavily)

1648
01:38:51.056 --> 01:38:53.809
When even a ship as hardy
as the Queen Mary

1649
01:38:53.809 --> 01:38:55.769
could be brought to her knees.

1650
01:38:56.186 --> 01:39:00.148
The year 1942.
she was en route to Scotland

1651
01:39:00.148 --> 01:39:03.610
with ten thousand. three hundred
and ninety-eight soldiers.

1652
01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:06.530
and nine hundred and fifty
crew on board.

1653
01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:10.868
Duly recorded on the ship's log
is the date and time.

1654
01:39:11.118 --> 01:39:14.413
the course. the destination.
weather conditions.

1655
01:39:14.913 --> 01:39:16.331
temperature.
(door opens)

1656
01:39:16.331 --> 01:39:18.542
longitude and latitude.

1657
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:23.130
But what is never recorded
is the fear that washes
over a deck

1658
01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.424
like fog and ocean spray.

1659
01:39:25.424 --> 01:39:28.468
as a ninety foot rogue
wave appears.

1660
01:39:28.594 --> 01:39:32.347
Yes. the RMS Queen Mary
is a frightened ship.

1661
01:39:32.347 --> 01:39:36.810
and she carries with her
a premonition...of death.

1662
01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:40.105
(tense music)

1663
01:39:40.314 --> 01:39:41.899
(siren blares)

1664
01:39:42.107 --> 01:39:43.525
(people shouting. screaming)

1665
01:39:54.077 --> 01:39:55.829
(crockery smashing)

1666
01:40:00.584 --> 01:40:02.794
(people screaming)

1667
01:40:06.089 --> 01:40:07.758
(creaking)

1668
01:40:23.106 --> 01:40:25.067
(siren fades)
(Anne groaning)

1669
01:40:29.655 --> 01:40:32.574
ANNE: Lukas. Oh. Lukas. baby.

1670
01:40:33.825 --> 01:40:34.910
Is that you?

1671
01:40:36.954 --> 01:40:37.996
Is that you?

1672
01:40:37.996 --> 01:40:40.290
(Lukas breathes heavily)

1673
01:40:42.125 --> 01:40:45.337
What happened to Jackie.
Mommy?

1674
01:40:49.216 --> 01:40:50.926
(Anne groaning)

1675
01:41:00.686 --> 01:41:01.687
Where are you?

1676
01:41:01.937 --> 01:41:03.146
Anne. please come in.

1677
01:41:03.146 --> 01:41:04.481
(clanging)
Fuck.

1678
01:41:10.612 --> 01:41:11.822
Oh.

1679
01:41:14.867 --> 01:41:15.826
(water dripping)

1680
01:41:16.827 --> 01:41:18.537
(men talking)

1681
01:41:19.246 --> 01:41:20.247
PATRICK: Lukas?

1682
01:41:21.999 --> 01:41:23.041
Where are you?

1683
01:41:31.592 --> 01:41:33.343
(soldier shouting)

1684
01:41:34.636 --> 01:41:37.097
(hatch door closes)
(siren blares)

1685
01:41:37.097 --> 01:41:38.932
(orchestral music)
(people screaming)

1686
01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:47.065
Keep moving and stay calm.

1687
01:41:47.399 --> 01:41:49.276
It's all part of the show!

1688
01:41:49.276 --> 01:41:51.028
(gunfire. guests screaming)

1689
01:41:51.778 --> 01:41:52.738
MAN: Move!

1690
01:41:54.406 --> 01:41:56.158
Move. move. move!

1691
01:41:56.158 --> 01:41:58.535
(clanging. creaking)

1692
01:42:00.871 --> 01:42:02.206
(gunfire)

1693
01:42:02.497 --> 01:42:03.916
CARRADINE: Don't let
him off the ship!

1694
01:42:05.751 --> 01:42:07.002
(David yells)

1695
01:42:08.003 --> 01:42:09.213
CARRADINE: Reverse the winch.

1696
01:42:11.882 --> 01:42:15.010
No. lower it! Lower it!

1697
01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:16.220
(tense music)

1698
01:42:27.564 --> 01:42:30.692
LUKAS: Mom. why can't I move on?

1699
01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:33.320
Oh. Lukas baby.

1700
01:42:33.987 --> 01:42:36.073
Jackie told me what happened.

1701
01:42:36.949 --> 01:42:39.326
LUKAS: We left him in the pool.

1702
01:42:40.827 --> 01:42:42.454
To rot...
(distorted) with the others.

1703
01:42:45.582 --> 01:42:46.917
Dad used to say...

1704
01:42:49.294 --> 01:42:52.589
...opportunity is
slippery (sniffs)

1705
01:42:53.632 --> 01:42:55.217
Like...(crying)

1706
01:42:56.385 --> 01:42:58.178
Like trying to catch a fish...

1707
01:42:59.304 --> 01:43:00.722
with your bare hands.

1708
01:43:01.932 --> 01:43:05.978
(sniffs) No matter
how much it begs.

1709
01:43:08.605 --> 01:43:10.107
tries to slip away.

1710
01:43:12.776 --> 01:43:14.403
(thunder clap)
hold on tight.

1711
01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:18.156
(sniffs)
(thunder crack)

1712
01:43:20.826 --> 01:43:23.078
And don't be afraid

1713
01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:27.040
to get your hands dirty.

1714
01:43:27.416 --> 01:43:32.129
Where...is...she?

1715
01:43:35.048 --> 01:43:37.634
ANNE: She's waiting for her mom.

1716
01:43:37.634 --> 01:43:39.052
(dramatic music)

1717
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:44.641
Stay with me...forever.

1718
01:43:45.642 --> 01:43:47.436
We'll be a family again.

1719
01:43:48.937 --> 01:43:51.815
Yes. I'll stay.

1720
01:43:53.108 --> 01:43:55.027
(waves crashing)

1721
01:43:55.694 --> 01:43:57.070
(tense music)

1722
01:44:03.243 --> 01:44:05.579
CARRADINE:
It's useless trying
to leave. Clarky.

1723
01:44:05.579 --> 01:44:08.081
DAVID: Even if I have to swim.
I'm getting off this ship.

1724
01:44:08.081 --> 01:44:09.124
(gunshot)
(groan)

1725
01:44:09.124 --> 01:44:10.250
(body thumps)

1726
01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:11.710
(people shouting)

1727
01:44:15.672 --> 01:44:17.299
(dramatic music)

1728
01:44:18.467 --> 01:44:23.847
Outside. there are laws
and obstacles to freedom.

1729
01:44:24.223 --> 01:44:25.891
Inside. there's only her.

1730
01:44:26.141 --> 01:44:27.267
(gunshot)
(groan)

1731
01:44:32.981 --> 01:44:34.483
I served my time.

1732
01:44:37.277 --> 01:44:38.946
I served my time!

1733
01:44:41.448 --> 01:44:42.824
I served my time!

1734
01:44:43.158 --> 01:44:45.202
You're the guardian. Clarky.

1735
01:44:45.744 --> 01:44:48.497
It's what they call
'a job for life'!

1736
01:44:50.165 --> 01:44:52.626
-Gibson!
-Captain. the man is unarmed!

1737
01:44:52.876 --> 01:44:54.044
Let go. you fool.

1738
01:44:54.044 --> 01:44:56.338
Or he'll take us all
to a watery grave.

1739
01:44:58.298 --> 01:45:00.008
(orchestral music)

1740
01:45:00.008 --> 01:45:01.718
Captain! Lower your rifle.

1741
01:45:01.718 --> 01:45:04.388
or I will have you
forcibly removed
and relieved of your duties.

1742
01:45:04.555 --> 01:45:06.598
If you are unwilling
to perform your duty.

1743
01:45:06.849 --> 01:45:08.267
I won't hesitate.

1744
01:45:08.517 --> 01:45:09.893
(gunshot)

1745
01:45:11.228 --> 01:45:12.729
(high tempo music)

1746
01:45:19.111 --> 01:45:20.070
(gun cocks)

1747
01:45:20.195 --> 01:45:22.906
Get back in your box!

1748
01:45:26.410 --> 01:45:28.537
(gunshot)

1749
01:45:29.538 --> 01:45:31.248
(wind howls)

1750
01:45:44.887 --> 01:45:46.763
(whirring sound)

1751
01:46:04.406 --> 01:46:05.532
Play something.

1752
01:46:06.575 --> 01:46:07.701
(exhales)

1753
01:46:09.161 --> 01:46:10.495
Something nice.

1754
01:46:15.417 --> 01:46:17.336
(violin starts playing)

1755
01:47:04.633 --> 01:47:06.885
