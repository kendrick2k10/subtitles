at me with interest."

for you right now.

out of that neon glow--

Jesus!

184
00:11:10.438 --> 00:11:12.042
I... I don't want
to do this anymore.

185
00:11:12.077 --> 00:11:13.307
Okay.

186
00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:15.276

a person like me to a motel.

190
00:11:25.893 --> 00:11:27.717
I was enjoying talking to you

191
00:11:27.752 --> 00:11:29.455
and I just wanted to talk more.

192
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.556
And it had the advantage
of being a place

193
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:34.229
nobody we know
could possibly recognize us.

194
00:11:34.264 --> 00:11:35.593
And it was the only place open.

Well. this is open.

196
00:11:37.762 --> 00:11:39.905
I couldn't take you here.

How old are you?

Yeah. I know. Me too. me too.

212
00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:17.239
I would never do
anything like this.

It's not even
a possibility for me.

there's a bible in the room.

with those flowers.

for the rest of your life.

was gonna go. "Whoa!"

that rises up quickly

That's anger for other people.

do you have?

on a cellular level.

to start my new project.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.378
Uh. surely that has
nothing to do with me.

358
00:20:06.413 --> 00:20:09.579
So. what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go right out this door.

359
00:20:09.614 --> 00:20:12.241
I mean. you find it so amusing.
this idea of pushing a button

360
00:20:12.276 --> 00:20:14.386
and then something
just suddenly doesn't exist.

361
00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:16.047
Well. this existed.

362
00:20:16.082 --> 00:20:17.719
I exist.

363
00:20:17.754 --> 00:20:19.215
And you hurt me.

364
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.217
[laughing]
I don't think I hurt you.

365
00:20:21.252 --> 00:20:22.790
Well. I'm gonna make it
like you hurt me.

366
00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:24.990
So you walk out that door.

367
00:20:25.025 --> 00:20:26.926
I'm gonna hurt you back.

368
00:20:26.961 --> 00:20:29.731
I really don't think I hurt you.

369
00:20:29.766 --> 00:20:32.635
I'm gonna figure out
how to kill you

370
00:20:33.132 --> 00:20:34.472
and get away with it.

371
00:20:34.507 --> 00:20:37.442
[soft. upbeat music plays]

372
00:20:37.477 --> 00:20:38.971
-Really?
-Yeah. really.

373
00:20:39.006 --> 00:20:40.841
Because. while I've never
done anything like that.

374
00:20:40.876 --> 00:20:43.811
and I'm smart. I think
I can get away with it.

375
00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:47.144
Then does it matter
if I stay or go?

376
00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:49.113
Oh. you are free to leave.

377
00:20:49.148 --> 00:20:52.149
Just understand that if you
never wanna see me again.

378
00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:54.591
then you better make sure that
you never see me again.

379
00:20:54.626 --> 00:20:56.527
Because if you do.
then that's the day

380
00:20:56.562 --> 00:20:58.496
I'm gonna push that button...

381
00:20:59.895 --> 00:21:02.797
and you will cease to exist.

382
00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:06.801
I think that's fair.

383
00:21:08.871 --> 00:21:11.267
I always knew my life would be
a collection of hideous moments

384
00:21:11.302 --> 00:21:13.346
ever since my mother told me
I would never be a ballerina.

385
00:21:13.381 --> 00:21:15.810
Which was difficult for both of
us. but I knew she was right.

386
00:21:15.845 --> 00:21:17.383
[sighs]

387
00:21:19.585 --> 00:21:21.277
Do you want me to help you?

388
00:21:21.312 --> 00:21:23.180
You don't touch me.

389
00:21:29.562 --> 00:21:31.023
[grunting]

390
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.830
I accept that when God made me

391
00:21:35.865 --> 00:21:39.966
he did not dip into his
reservoir of physical grace.

392
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:43.772
So. I've always tried to make up
for that with quirk!

393
00:21:44.577 --> 00:21:48.678
Which has somehow saved me from
horrible moments of public shame

394
00:21:48.713 --> 00:21:49.613
until tonight.

395
00:21:50.913 --> 00:21:52.517
You did it. Allen.

396
00:21:52.552 --> 00:21:56.180
You are responsible for the most
humiliating moment of my life.

397
00:21:57.249 --> 00:21:59.986
All this time. I was sure
it would be me. but no.

398
00:22:00.021 --> 00:22:01.361
It was you.

399
00:22:03.431 --> 00:22:05.090
I don't even want to be
in the same room with you

400
00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:06.366
where there's a bed.

401
00:22:14.101 --> 00:22:16.002
I'll tell you what else God did.

402
00:22:16.037 --> 00:22:17.773
He put night between the days

403
00:22:17.808 --> 00:22:19.742
so tomorrow could be a new one.

404
00:22:19.777 --> 00:22:21.777
So. all you have to do is

405
00:22:21.812 --> 00:22:25.451
accept my very sincere apology.

406
00:22:25.486 --> 00:22:27.046
and then this day can be over.

407
00:22:27.081 --> 00:22:28.586
And we can go to sleep.

408
00:22:32.416 --> 00:22:34.889
And so can the people
in the surrounding apartments.

409
00:22:35.562 --> 00:22:37.529
Oh. am I being a little loud?

410
00:22:37.564 --> 00:22:39.223
[male neighbor]
Yes. you are. darling.

411
00:22:39.258 --> 00:22:41.797
I'm sorry!
We're having a fight here.

412
00:22:43.427 --> 00:22:45.361
It was a reflex action.

413
00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:47.198
I saw the flowers.

414
00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:48.936
I reached out
and I grabbed them.

415
00:22:49.972 --> 00:22:51.972
You climbed on a table.

416
00:22:52.007 --> 00:22:54.172
and threw yourself
across the room.

417
00:22:55.142 --> 00:22:56.713
It was the most awful moment

418
00:22:56.748 --> 00:22:59.210
in the whole history of women
being stuck with you idiots.

419
00:22:59.245 --> 00:23:00.552
Because I caught
the bridal bouquet?

420
00:23:00.587 --> 00:23:01.454
No!

421
00:23:02.754 --> 00:23:04.754
Because you knew
it meant something to me.

422
00:23:05.526 --> 00:23:07.290
and you left it in the street.

423
00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:12.157
[male neighbor] You bastard.

424
00:23:15.536 --> 00:23:16.733
[chatter]

425
00:23:16.768 --> 00:23:18.669
[siren in distance]

426
00:23:18.704 --> 00:23:20.572
[Grace] Well. this is nice.

427
00:23:20.607 --> 00:23:22.101
Could we get killed out here?

428
00:23:22.136 --> 00:23:23.432
[Sam] It's okay.

429
00:23:23.467 --> 00:23:26.776
Seriously. do you think
this could be a mistake?

430
00:23:26.811 --> 00:23:29.812
No. this is wonderful.
I'll tell you what's a mistake.

431
00:23:29.847 --> 00:23:31.550
Everything I've ever done.

432
00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.247
You know how many girlfriends I
took for a walk in high school?

433
00:23:36.282 --> 00:23:37.952
[chuckling] No.

434
00:23:37.987 --> 00:23:40.416
One. One girlfriend.

435
00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:41.417
-Oh?
-Martha.

436
00:23:41.452 --> 00:23:44.189
She had a pink angora sweater.

437
00:23:44.224 --> 00:23:45.663
Which was the end of me.

438
00:23:45.698 --> 00:23:48.094
The leaves would blow
off the trees and stick to it.

439
00:23:48.129 --> 00:23:50.459
And one time.
she let me pull them off.

440
00:23:50.494 --> 00:23:53.264
Oh. yeah.
We're diabolical like that.

441
00:23:53.299 --> 00:23:55.805
-That got me through winter...
-Uh-huh.

442
00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.708
...when I asked her
to go sledding with me

443
00:23:57.743 --> 00:23:59.369
but I didn't bring my sled.

444
00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:00.612
So there was only one sled.

445
00:24:00.647 --> 00:24:02.372
So we had to
lie on top of each other.

446
00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:04.517
Oh! Yeah.

447
00:24:04.552 --> 00:24:06.376
You guys are less clever.

448
00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:07.949
But. you know. we appreciate it

449
00:24:07.984 --> 00:24:10.017
when you include us
in your plans.

450
00:24:11.317 --> 00:24:13.185
We were soaked from the snow.

451
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.890
-Uh-huh.
-We went back to her house.

452
00:24:15.827 --> 00:24:17.662
And she took off
all her clothes.

453
00:24:17.697 --> 00:24:20.632
Right in front of me.
And there she was. a naked girl.

454
00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:22.227
Smiling at me.

455
00:24:22.262 --> 00:24:24.669
Like I would know what
to do with a naked girl.

456
00:24:24.704 --> 00:24:26.033
Did you?

457
00:24:32.778 --> 00:24:34.844
Is there something
wrong with me?

458
00:24:34.879 --> 00:24:36.582
Because. in this time
we're spending together.

459
00:24:36.617 --> 00:24:38.507
that's all you really need
to figure out. right?

460
00:24:38.542 --> 00:24:40.520
So. is there something
wrong with me?

461
00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.523
Are you holding out
for a ballerina?

462
00:24:44.625 --> 00:24:46.757
You've always been
a ballerina to me.

463
00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:49.254
Oh. boy.

464
00:24:49.289 --> 00:24:50.992
If we weren't having
this argument right now.

465
00:24:51.027 --> 00:24:53.126
I'd be kissing
everything you got.

466
00:24:58.067 --> 00:24:59.605
Here. you can have two.

467
00:25:00.971 --> 00:25:03.004
Don't you think
our relationship works?

468
00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:05.842
Why would we change
something that works?

469
00:25:05.877 --> 00:25:08.405
Less people are getting
married. you know.

470
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.978
What if they're onto something?

471
00:25:11.916 --> 00:25:13.278
I have a different thing.

472
00:25:13.313 --> 00:25:15.313
Okay. What do you got?

473
00:25:15.986 --> 00:25:17.282
I've got. this thing works

474
00:25:17.317 --> 00:25:18.921
because I thought
it was going somewhere.

475
00:25:18.956 --> 00:25:20.857
Now that I know you think we've
arrived at where we're going.

476
00:25:20.892 --> 00:25:22.353
it's gonna start
not working so good.

477
00:25:22.388 --> 00:25:24.894
I love what we are.

478
00:25:24.929 --> 00:25:27.963
I'm happy with what we are
together. Is that no good?

479
00:25:27.998 --> 00:25:29.701
You decide what I am to you.

480
00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:31.131
I love you right now.

481
00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:32.902
And now.

482
00:25:32.937 --> 00:25:34.464
You don't even get
to say that anymore.

483
00:25:39.438 --> 00:25:41.372
How do you know you're not
gonna meet someone better?

484
00:25:41.407 --> 00:25:43.946
I'm telling you
I'll stop looking forever.

485
00:25:45.015 --> 00:25:46.476
How do you know that now?

486
00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:48.247
Are you a scared man?

487
00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:50.546
No.

488
00:25:50.581 --> 00:25:52.482
Because I don't want
a scared man.

489
00:25:53.023 --> 00:25:54.319
You're just lucky
what you did tonight

490
00:25:54.354 --> 00:25:56.156
doesn't stop me
from knowing who you really are.

491
00:25:56.994 --> 00:25:58.631
I am lucky. but...

492
00:25:59.623 --> 00:26:01.634
I don't get
to touch you anymore.

493
00:26:02.362 --> 00:26:04.802
Is that all you want? Here.

494
00:26:13.142 --> 00:26:14.614
This is my heart.

495
00:26:15.782 --> 00:26:17.375
This is my mind.

496
00:26:19.214 --> 00:26:22.655
All this can be yours if you
call within the next 24 hours.

497
00:26:23.383 --> 00:26:24.987
Operators are standing by.

498
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.486
[soft. upbeat instrumental
music playing]

499
00:26:53.017 --> 00:26:55.985
You've got one day to tell me
we're on the road to somewhere.

500
00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.152
Not that we're here
and this is it.

501
00:26:58.187 --> 00:27:00.022
because this is not it.

502
00:27:04.259 --> 00:27:06.358
Anything besides a "yes"
is a "no."

503
00:27:11.365 --> 00:27:13.167
[door closes]

504
00:27:13.202 --> 00:27:16.071
[faint siren]

505
00:27:16.106 --> 00:27:19.206
So. Martha and I had
more romantic evenings.

506
00:27:19.241 --> 00:27:21.604
and what was awkward became...

507
00:27:23.245 --> 00:27:27.016
Well... [chuckles]
I became proficient.

508
00:27:27.051 --> 00:27:28.644
I just thought.

509
00:27:28.679 --> 00:27:30.921
what good is it
having this skill

510
00:27:30.956 --> 00:27:33.649
but Martha's going to be
the only one who knows it.

511
00:27:33.684 --> 00:27:36.322
I just wanted
to show someone else

512
00:27:36.357 --> 00:27:37.829
what I could do.

513
00:27:37.864 --> 00:27:39.930
And word would get
around the halls.

514
00:27:39.965 --> 00:27:43.362
and everyone would know
what Martha and I had.

515
00:27:43.397 --> 00:27:45.166
That's... That's all I wanted.

516
00:27:45.201 --> 00:27:47.905
-That was my plan. [chuckles]
-Yeah?

517
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.368
What do you think?

518
00:27:49.403 --> 00:27:52.107
I don't know. I mean.
how did it work out for you?

519
00:27:52.142 --> 00:27:54.340
I took another girl to bed.

520
00:27:54.375 --> 00:27:57.673
Which was easy. because
I belonged to somebody else.

521
00:27:57.708 --> 00:27:59.543
And you got caught.

522
00:27:59.578 --> 00:28:01.677
Martha walked in on us.

523
00:28:01.712 --> 00:28:03.349
I. um...

524
00:28:03.384 --> 00:28:04.955
I looked up at her and I said.

525
00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:08.057
"Hi. I'm doing this for us."

526
00:28:08.092 --> 00:28:10.125
I never saw such a look

527
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.689
of complete disappointment.

528
00:28:13.724 --> 00:28:16.329
Except on my wife's face
all the time.

529
00:28:17.937 --> 00:28:19.772
Martha never talked to me again.

530
00:28:19.807 --> 00:28:21.730
But you want to know what?

531
00:28:21.765 --> 00:28:23.633
When I was with the other girl.

532
00:28:23.668 --> 00:28:26.779
in my head. it was
always Martha anyway.

533
00:28:27.342 --> 00:28:29.573
You never heard from her again?

534
00:28:29.608 --> 00:28:33.247
One time. I got a letter
with no return address.

535
00:28:33.282 --> 00:28:37.086
It said. "Sam. I'm married now
and I love my husband."

536
00:28:37.121 --> 00:28:40.122
"But when I love him the most.
he reminds me of you."

537
00:28:40.157 --> 00:28:42.619
Oh. That's devastating.

538
00:28:42.654 --> 00:28:45.061
Oh! I was thrilled.

539
00:28:45.096 --> 00:28:49.098
Because. as hard as I try.
I can't satisfy my wife.

540
00:28:49.133 --> 00:28:51.562
But here. without trying.
without even being there.

541
00:28:51.597 --> 00:28:54.598
someone was thinking
nice things about me.

542
00:28:55.304 --> 00:28:57.469
I think nice things
about you. Sam.

543
00:28:59.044 --> 00:29:02.309
You know. no matter what tricks
you picked up in high school.

to consider the idea.

[Monica] Well. how exactly
would that work?

674
00:35:55.922 --> 00:35:59.187

the only question that matters.

would leave you afraid

But that's not enough for her.
She...

686

She wants me to be happy
with her in the future.

687
00:36:30.792 --> 00:36:32.187
I think that sounds romantic.

688

it's science fiction.

00:36:34.763 --> 00:36:35.894
All right.

I want to talk to

about anything
that happens to me.

693
00:36:45.004 --> 00:36:47.609
Aww. Well then. why do you
want that to change?

694
00:36:47.644 --> 00:36:48.643
Why would it change?

695
00:36:48.678 --> 00:36:50.073
When you change
the relationship.

696
00:36:50.108 --> 00:36:51.877
-the relationship changes.
-I said that to her.

697
00:36:51.912 --> 00:36:54.319

This boy that we made

698

applied sound logic.

699
00:36:56.422 --> 00:36:57.520
And what did she say?

700
00:36:58.754 --> 00:37:00.622
She wants me to jump
off a cliff with her.

701
00:37:01.427 --> 00:37:02.888
I mean. is there value in that?

702
00:37:02.923 --> 00:37:05.759
In... holding someone's hand
and closing your eyes?

703
00:37:05.794 --> 00:37:08.300
[Monica] That's very young.

704
00:37:08.335 --> 00:37:10.929
She's traditional. Allen.

705

You know. a perky believer
in the happily-ever-after.

706
00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.901
Which is strange. I thought

00:44:42.052 --> 00:44:43.645
And his mother?

879
00:44:44.824 --> 00:44:46.120
He has one.

880
00:44:46.155 --> 00:44:48.892
So. you wanna know
what killed relationships?

881
00:44:48.927 --> 00:44:50.861
Antibiotics.

882
00:44:50.896 --> 00:44:53.028
Drop dead at 46
like we used to in the old days.

883
00:44:53.063 --> 00:44:55.030
and then it's over really fast.
Who cares. right?

884
00:44:55.065 --> 00:44:58.231
But "till death do us part"
needed a rewrite

885
00:44:58.266 --> 00:44:59.903
after penicillin.

886
00:44:59.938 --> 00:45:01.597
[chuckles]

887
00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:03.599
How many serious relationships
have you been in?

888
00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:05.139
I thought I had a couple
before this one.

889
00:45:05.174 --> 00:45:06.943
But now that I have this one...

890
00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:08.637
one.

891
00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:12.949
-You don't like Michelle?
-No. I like her fine. Allen.

892
00:45:12.984 --> 00:45:15.281
-She cooks for you?
-We cook together.

893
00:45:15.316 --> 00:45:16.953
Oh. that's sweet.

894
00:45:16.988 --> 00:45:19.890
So. maybe someday you'll take
some classes at Sur La Table.

895
00:45:19.925 --> 00:45:22.288
And then. as you're waiting
for the soufflé to rise.

896
00:45:22.323 --> 00:45:25.720
you'll look around and think.
"What the hell happened to me?"

897
00:45:25.755 --> 00:45:28.261
And I bet she cleans
the apartment.

898
00:45:28.296 --> 00:45:30.230
We do these things together.
Mom. are you kidding me?

899
00:45:30.265 --> 00:45:32.001
[Sam] They do things
together as a couple.

900
00:45:32.036 --> 00:45:34.135
Why doesn't that seem
correct to you?

901
00:45:38.944 --> 00:45:40.603
Dad. you've just
been sitting there?

902
00:45:41.947 --> 00:45:43.408
For 40 years.

903
00:45:43.443 --> 00:45:44.948
Waiting for food.

904
00:45:45.775 --> 00:45:48.611
So. why haven't we
met these people?

905
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.747
I was just trying to avoid
an awkward situation.

906
00:45:52.782 --> 00:45:55.519
But why would it be
an awkward situation?

907
00:45:55.554 --> 00:45:58.093
No father of the girl wants
to meet the father of the boy

908
00:45:58.128 --> 00:45:59.622
who's been getting it for free.

909
00:45:59.657 --> 00:46:02.427
Daddy! Is that what's
important to you? Huh? Huh?!

910
00:46:02.462 --> 00:46:04.330
That's what's important to him!

911
00:46:04.365 --> 00:46:06.530
How do you know
what's important to him?

912
00:46:06.565 --> 00:46:07.872
[Howard] Where is the ring?

913
00:46:07.907 --> 00:46:09.698
-[gasps]
-Where's the ring?

914
00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:12.206
Yep. Where's the ring?
I don't see the ring.

915
00:46:12.241 --> 00:46:14.802
I wanna see the ring! Here.

916
00:46:14.837 --> 00:46:16.276
-What are you doing? What?
-This is a ring.

917
00:46:16.311 --> 00:46:18.311
Look at this ring. This. this.

918
00:46:18.346 --> 00:46:21.545
This ring means commitment.
This ring means loyalty.

919
00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.679
This ring means trust.

920
00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:26.220
Did...
Where the hell is the ring?

921
00:46:26.255 --> 00:46:28.387
Yeah. well... it's in.

922
00:46:28.422 --> 00:46:29.960
-Yeah. that's what it is.
-In?

923
00:46:29.995 --> 00:46:31.192
Mm-hmm.

924
00:46:31.227 --> 00:46:33.293
In where? Where's it in?

925
00:46:33.328 --> 00:46:34.492
It's in.

926
00:46:34.527 --> 00:46:36.901
I took it in to get it adjusted

927
00:46:36.936 --> 00:46:38.826
because my fingers
are getting really fatter.

928
00:46:38.861 --> 00:46:40.531
What are you talking about?

929
00:46:40.566 --> 00:46:42.269
I got the fat fingers.

930
00:46:42.909 --> 00:46:44.876
I mean. I just...
Oh. what have I done?

931
00:46:44.911 --> 00:46:46.042
I didn't want you to know.

932
00:46:46.077 --> 00:46:47.703
-Let me see.
-Yeah.

933
00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:49.804
-Fat. Fat fingers.
-[chuckling]

934
00:46:49.839 --> 00:46:51.674
Oh. honey.

935
00:46:51.709 --> 00:46:54.842
These are lovely fingers.

936
00:46:54.877 --> 00:46:56.987
-Do you really think so?
-Yes.

937
00:46:57.022 --> 00:46:58.549
Yes. I do.

938
00:46:59.519 --> 00:47:01.387
-Yes.
-[whimpers] Because...

939
00:47:01.422 --> 00:47:03.521
-Yes. Yes.
-Okay.

940
00:47:03.556 --> 00:47:06.326
You see how emotional
she gets about the ring?

941
00:47:06.361 --> 00:47:09.164
It's because it's what...
what you do with it.

942
00:47:09.199 --> 00:47:11.430
It's what everything
you put into it

943
00:47:11.465 --> 00:47:13.069
and all the emotions around it.

944
00:47:13.104 --> 00:47:16.369
And it's like maybe the most
important thing you ever get.

945
00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:18.877
Where's yours?

946
00:47:21.112 --> 00:47:22.474
In my underwear drawer.

947
00:47:23.114 --> 00:47:24.377
Uh. I'd like to see it.

948
00:47:24.412 --> 00:47:25.774
No. No. no. no.

949
00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:27.842
Yeah. but I would like to see
your wedding ring.

950
00:47:27.877 --> 00:47:29.712
-I haven't seen it...
-I don't think--

951
00:47:29.747 --> 00:47:31.417
-...in a long time. actually.
-It doesn't fit.

952
00:47:31.452 --> 00:47:33.188
-It jams me.
-Oh. I see.

953
00:47:33.223 --> 00:47:34.684
You don't think
I have it. do you?

954
00:47:34.719 --> 00:47:35.784
I wanna see it.

955
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.425
No! No.

956
00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.098
It stays where it is.
and you wanna know why?

957
00:47:42.133 --> 00:47:43.902
Because every day

958
00:47:44.663 --> 00:47:46.564
I see that when
I put on my underwear.

959
00:47:46.599 --> 00:47:49.941
And the symbolism of that is:
I am married.

960
00:47:49.976 --> 00:47:52.240
and I am covering up
my situation.

961
00:47:52.275 --> 00:47:54.638
[groans]

962
00:47:54.673 --> 00:47:57.476
I wanna see the ring.

963
00:47:59.942 --> 00:48:01.447
So do I. Where is it?

964
00:48:01.482 --> 00:48:03.812
In my night table drawer.

965
00:48:03.847 --> 00:48:06.254
Next to the bible. Get it.

966
00:48:06.289 --> 00:48:08.520
You're a good woman. honey.

967
00:48:13.263 --> 00:48:15.296
You two are fabulous.
you know that?

968
00:48:16.794 --> 00:48:19.927
It's your fault
I believe in all this stuff.

969
00:48:19.962 --> 00:48:22.237
Look. we've already established
she's an old-fashioned girl.

970
00:48:22.272 --> 00:48:24.338
Maybe she just loves
to cook and clean.

971
00:48:24.373 --> 00:48:25.900
Why don't you have her over
to do the house?

972
00:48:25.935 --> 00:48:27.407
Hey!

973
00:48:27.442 --> 00:48:29.937
Are you really going to give
the rest of your life

974
00:48:29.972 --> 00:48:32.181
to someone because
they cook and clean?

975
00:48:32.216 --> 00:48:34.942
Are you gonna leave it up to us
to help you make this decision?

976
00:48:34.977 --> 00:48:36.779
I came to you both
to learn something.

977
00:48:36.814 --> 00:48:38.649
This shouldn't have
anything to do with us.

978
00:48:38.684 --> 00:48:40.585
Oh. but it really does.

979
00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:42.191
Well. what should it
have to do with?

980
00:48:43.128 --> 00:48:44.787
It should have to do with love.

981
00:48:44.822 --> 00:48:46.525
-I found it. Look at that.
-[Grace] Oh!

982
00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.428
Look at that. Uh-huh.

983
00:48:48.463 --> 00:48:51.134
That is the symbol of our love.

984
00:48:51.169 --> 00:48:53.301
Put it on. honey.

985
00:48:53.336 --> 00:48:55.435
Um... You know. I--

986
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:58.042
Boy. I... I don't think it's
gonna fit these fingers.

987
00:48:58.077 --> 00:48:59.505
You wanna kiss 'em?

988
00:49:01.146 --> 00:49:03.146
Here.
You know what I'm gonna do?

989
00:49:03.181 --> 00:49:06.116
-[grunts aggressively
-Yeah. you hurt me.

990
00:49:06.151 --> 00:49:09.152
I'm sorry. Never take that
off again. okay?

991
00:49:10.012 --> 00:49:11.814
I understand your position.
honey.

992
00:49:14.489 --> 00:49:16.126
Look at that.

993
00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:17.490
Bing.

994
00:49:17.525 --> 00:49:20.064
That's really on now.
That's on there good. Bing!

995
00:49:20.099 --> 00:49:21.692
-Oh. yeah.
-[Grace] Mm-hmm.

996
00:49:21.727 --> 00:49:25.333
On there forever just because
I asked her one question.

997
00:49:25.368 --> 00:49:27.005
Do you love me?

998
00:49:28.701 --> 00:49:29.997
What do you mean?

999
00:49:30.032 --> 00:49:32.439
And if the answer is yes.
I wanna know why.

1000
00:49:33.574 --> 00:49:35.244
I was originally captured

1001
00:49:35.279 --> 00:49:37.873
by your strong sense
of interior design.

1002
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.579
That's why you love me?

1003
00:49:41.714 --> 00:49:43.417
Does Michelle make you happy?

1004
00:49:43.452 --> 00:49:44.715
I think so.

1005
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.486
How can you not know
if you're happy?

1006
00:49:46.521 --> 00:49:47.949
Are you happy. Dad?

1007
00:49:49.051 --> 00:49:50.886
I'm as happy as I'm gonna get.

1008
00:49:52.395 --> 00:49:54.890
[Howard] Michelle. we're fine
with whatever you do.

1009
00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:57.926
We just hope that
we were good influences.

1010
00:49:57.961 --> 00:49:59.334
We always told you the truth

1011
00:49:59.369 --> 00:50:01.600
that we believed
at the time. honey.

1012
00:50:01.635 --> 00:50:03.932
Like when you said
I would never be a ballerina?

1013
00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:06.000
I know. honey.
I'm sorry. You won't.

1014
00:50:06.035 --> 00:50:07.573
[scoffs]

1015
00:50:07.608 --> 00:50:08.838
-Here's truth.
-Okay.

1016
00:50:08.873 --> 00:50:10.906
These people are as much
to blame as we are

1017
00:50:10.941 --> 00:50:13.007
for all of us
arriving at this point.

1018
00:50:13.042 --> 00:50:15.350
You think they'd have the
courtesy to invite us to dinner?

1019
00:50:15.385 --> 00:50:16.846
[scoffs]

1020
00:50:16.881 --> 00:50:19.013
I mean. our kid
sleeps with their kid.

1021
00:50:19.048 --> 00:50:21.521
Doesn't that entitle us
to a dinner?

1022
00:50:21.556 --> 00:50:23.886
He's right. Yes!
Just get him over here.

1023
00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:25.525
-[Howard] Yes.
-Mom. seriously?

1024
00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:28.099
Oh. I'm not gonna be blamed
for what I taught you. okay?

1025
00:50:28.134 --> 00:50:29.694
[Howard] Go!

1026
00:50:29.729 --> 00:50:31.267
[Grace] Yeah.

1027
00:50:31.302 --> 00:50:32.664
Come on. let's do it.

1028
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.536
Except. why can't we go there?

1029
00:50:36.571 --> 00:50:38.307
[sighs]

1030
00:50:38.342 --> 00:50:41.035
Why does everything
have to be expensive for me?

1031
00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:43.774
[line ringing]

1032
00:50:43.809 --> 00:50:45.248
[cell phone vibrates]

1033
00:50:46.152 --> 00:50:48.119
Michelle. my bell!

1034
00:50:48.154 --> 00:50:49.483
-Yikes.
-How are you?

1035
00:50:49.518 --> 00:50:51.485
We were just talking about you.

1036
00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:54.048
Hi. You were?

1037
00:50:54.083 --> 00:50:55.423
<i>Endlessly.</i>

1038
00:50:55.458 --> 00:50:56.886
Yes-- [grunts]

1039
00:50:56.921 --> 00:50:57.821
Howdy.

1040
00:50:57.856 --> 00:50:59.592
<i>Howdy to you too.</i>

1041
00:51:00.595 --> 00:51:02.089
Here's an interesting thing
that's gonna happen.

1042
00:51:02.124 --> 00:51:04.498
but first. I miss you.

1043
00:51:06.304 --> 00:51:07.468
I miss you too.

1044
00:51:08.933 --> 00:51:10.306
Great.

1045
00:51:10.341 --> 00:51:12.506
My parents wanna have you guys
over for dinner tonight.

1046
00:51:12.541 --> 00:51:15.212
They think it would be nice
if we all finally got together.

1047
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:19.007
I'd rather just get married.

1048
00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:20.943
<i>So. I'll see you tonight?</i>

1049
00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:23.121
Instinctively. a bad idea.

1050
00:51:24.982 --> 00:51:26.520
[whispers] Do it.

1051
00:51:28.227 --> 00:51:32.262
So. Michelle and her parents

1052
00:51:32.297 --> 00:51:35.364
would like to have you
over for dinner tonight.

1053
00:51:35.399 --> 00:51:38.092
-All of us?
-No. I'm not going to that.

1054
00:51:38.127 --> 00:51:39.269
Mute. Where's mute?

1055
00:51:39.304 --> 00:51:41.095
No. absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

1056
00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:43.339
This is a sucker play.
They're throwing out the net.

1057
00:51:43.374 --> 00:51:45.605
She's gonna reel you in
like a trout.

1058
00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:48.476
You take care of it.
Go ahead. Sam. take care of it.

1059

-[phone beeps]
-Hi. Michelle.

1060

-Hi.

1061
00:51:55.386 --> 00:51:56.781
We'd love to come.

1062

-[Monica] What?!
-[Michelle]<i> Amazing.</i>

1063
00:51:59.324 --> 00:52:02.193
My parents are so excited
to meet you guys.

1064
00:52:02.228 --> 00:52:04.459
How's seven o'clock?

1065
00:52:04.494 --> 00:52:06.989
That's great.
Can we bring anything?

1066
00:52:07.024 --> 00:52:09.959
Just yourselves.
I'm sure that will be plenty.

1067
00:52:09.994 --> 00:52:11.433
Looking forward to it.

1068
00:52:12.865 --> 00:52:14.502
Why don't you wanna
meet these people?

1069
00:52:14.537 --> 00:52:17.065
What could we possibly
have in common?

1070
00:52:19.443 --> 00:52:22.246
Whoo! Yay!

1071
00:52:22.281 --> 00:52:24.743
[rock music interlude]

1072
00:52:37.087 --> 00:52:39.329
I'm in Mamaroneck.

1073
00:52:39.364 --> 00:52:42.233
There isn't enough alcohol
in the world.

1074
00:52:42.268 --> 00:52:44.433
[heavy sigh]

1075
00:52:45.535 --> 00:52:47.568
I have a little bit
of a buzz on.

1076
00:52:48.802 --> 00:52:52.408
This one's a lack of awareness
bordering on hallucination.

1077
00:52:52.905 --> 00:52:54.542
[doorbell rings]

1078
00:52:56.205 --> 00:52:57.479
I'll get it!

1079
00:53:03.322 --> 00:53:05.520
God bless us. everyone.

1080
00:53:05.555 --> 00:53:07.489
Michelle. hi.

1081
00:53:11.891 --> 00:53:13.154
Yep.

1082

Michelle.

1083

Darling! Aww. mwah!

1084
00:53:19.899 --> 00:53:21.635
-Mmm.
-Oh. right.

1085
00:53:22.638 --> 00:53:25.067
Oh. what a lovely little house.

1086
00:53:25.102 --> 00:53:27.872
Look. Sam. this is exactly
what we would have

1087
00:53:27.907 --> 00:53:29.643
if I did quaint.

1088
00:53:29.678 --> 00:53:32.778
And mama and papa.
where are they?

1089
00:53:33.484 --> 00:53:36.485
[chuckles]
You did say seven. didn't you?

1090
00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.289
You are right on time.

1091
00:53:38.324 --> 00:53:40.214
They're just running
a little late.

1092
00:53:40.249 --> 00:53:42.293
Well. we could come back
another time. couldn't we?

1093
00:53:42.328 --> 00:53:43.459
What works for you. sweetheart?

1094
00:53:43.494 --> 00:53:45.054
-Mother!
-[Grace] Yeah!

1095
00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:47.892
I should've been ready. like.

[Michelle chuckles nervously]

1098
00:53:52.932 --> 00:53:55.834
Hey! Oh. my goodness. Allen. hi.

-Hi.
-And wait a minute.

1100

Monica. It is so nice
to finally meet you.

1102

-Well. thank you.
-Yeah.

1103
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:07.483
Thank you. We really should've
done this a long time ago.

-Right?
-Yeah.

1105

Well. now that
you've met my mother.

1106

I'd like to introduce you to...

Well. Allen.
where is your father?

1109
00:54:17.187 --> 00:54:18.593
Couldn't he make it?

1110
00:54:18.628 --> 00:54:20.661
My husband.
did he leave us here?

1111
00:54:20.696 --> 00:54:22.696
The door's open. so. maybe...

1112
00:54:22.731 --> 00:54:25.798

Hey. everybody!

1115
00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:41.550
Sorry I'm a little late.

1116

[both gasp]

1117
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.312
[laughs] Hey!

1118
00:54:45.347 --> 00:54:47.116
[whispers] You're in my house?

1119
00:54:47.151 --> 00:54:49.283
[chuckles] Yeah.
It's even worse than that.

1120
00:54:49.318 --> 00:54:51.956
You can't kill me now.
I've got company.

1121
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:52.891
-Guess what?
-What?

1122
00:54:52.926 --> 00:54:54.629
-What?
-I'm the company.

1123

Oh. dear God.

[laughs]

1131
00:55:25.464 --> 00:55:28.091
Howard. uh. this is Monica.

1132
00:55:28.126 --> 00:55:30.731
And. Monica. this is
my husband. Howard.

1133
00:55:31.437 --> 00:55:33.800
How do you do? [muffled laugh]

This is my daughter. Michelle.

1137
00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:47.044
I am the father of her.
You know where I live now.

1138
00:55:47.079 --> 00:55:50.278
I found your little house. Mmm.

1139
00:55:58.992 --> 00:56:00.827
Instinctively. bad idea.

1140
00:56:02.666 --> 00:56:05.392
Um. yeah. You know what this is?

1141
00:56:05.427 --> 00:56:07.537
This is. um.
what would you call this.

1142
00:56:07.572 --> 00:56:10.265
a little free-floating anxiety?

1143
00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:13.202
-More.
-Way more.

1144
00:56:13.237 --> 00:56:14.874
Right. Right. because

1145
00:56:14.909 --> 00:56:17.140
everyone knows how important
this is. sweetie. really.

1146
00:56:17.175 --> 00:56:18.647
And so. we're just trying
to make sure

1147
00:56:18.682 --> 00:56:20.484
that it's an evening
to remember.

1148

-[Monica laughs]
-[doorbell rings]

1149
00:56:23.412 --> 00:56:24.950
Oh. that must be my husband.

1150
00:56:24.985 --> 00:56:27.722
Oh! Oh. well. I'll let him in.

1151
00:56:27.757 --> 00:56:29.823
And we'll all loosen up
right now.

1152
00:56:29.858 --> 00:56:31.594
You'll see. You'll see.

1153

[opens door]

1154
00:56:38.504 --> 00:56:41.934
Oh! Well...

1155
00:56:41.969 --> 00:56:43.771
No. no. I. um...

1156
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:46.334
That actually wasn't
your husband. [chuckles]

1157
00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:49.942
But can I ask you a couple
questions about your husband?

1158
00:56:49.977 --> 00:56:51.944
-Mom.
-Huh?

1159
00:56:51.979 --> 00:56:55.178
Because it's... it's all
really too much. honey.

1160
00:56:55.213 --> 00:56:56.751
It's just... It's like...
I mean...

1161
00:56:56.786 --> 00:57:00.084
This could decide
the rest of our lives.

1162
00:57:00.119 --> 00:57:01.954
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I think she's right.

1163
00:57:01.989 --> 00:57:03.791
-Yeah.
-I think...

1164
00:57:03.826 --> 00:57:05.529
I think that everybody...

1165
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:08.499
should go home.

1166
00:57:09.161 --> 00:57:10.193
What?

1167
00:57:10.228 --> 00:57:12.129
As clearly as I could.
I said it.

1168
00:57:12.164 --> 00:57:14.967
Guys. this is happening.

1169
00:57:15.002 --> 00:57:17.970
We... We want to decide
the rest of our lives.

1170
00:57:18.005 --> 00:57:19.576
Well. we don't. actually.

1171
00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:23.613
We do. and we can't
if you don't open the door.

1172
00:57:23.648 --> 00:57:25.648

1176
00:57:39.158 --> 00:57:40.696
Um...

1177
00:57:40.731 --> 00:57:42.027
Oh!

1178
00:57:42.931 --> 00:57:45.833
-Uh...
-[Sam clears throat]

1179
00:57:47.397 --> 00:57:48.671
[Grace sighs heavily]

1180
00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:53.511
Look what you did to him.

1181
00:57:55.713 --> 00:57:57.405
[scoffs]

1182
00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:59.847
No. you're right.
We should do this more often.

1183
00:57:59.882 --> 00:58:01.145
You have to do something.

1184
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.751
You have to do something.
It's your house.

1185
00:58:05.624 --> 00:58:07.657
Would anyone care for a drink?

1186
00:58:07.692 --> 00:58:09.824
-[all] Yes!
-Ah. Michelle.

1187
00:58:09.859 --> 00:58:10.924
Allen?

1188
00:58:10.959 --> 00:58:12.519
We'll have wine. thank you.

1189
00:58:12.554 --> 00:58:14.895
Wine. Grace. a drink?

1190
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:16.490
I do now. [awkward laugh]

1191
00:58:16.525 --> 00:58:18.195
Oh. yes.

1192
00:58:19.704 --> 00:58:21.396
I'll have the usual.

1193
00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:23.574
[nervous chuckle] Come on.

1194
00:58:23.609 --> 00:58:26.434
All right. Tanqueray martini.
Extra dry with a twist.

1195
00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:29.107
-Ow!
-Oh. now it's "ow"?

1196
00:58:29.912 --> 00:58:31.208
What's his name?

1197
00:58:31.243 --> 00:58:32.946
-[Monica] Sam.
-Sam!

1198
00:58:32.981 --> 00:58:35.278
-Yeah.
-What are you drinking. buddy?

1199
00:58:35.313 --> 00:58:37.412
-Bourbon.
-How about a double?

1200
00:58:37.447 --> 00:58:40.052
-How about the bottle?
-[all laugh]

1201
00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:42.384
Who could blame you?

1202
00:58:42.419 --> 00:58:44.122
[Grace] Oh...

1203
00:58:44.157 --> 00:58:46.289
Look. why don't I help him
make the drinks.

1204
00:58:46.324 --> 00:58:47.928
and you take everyone
on a tour of the house?

1205
00:58:47.963 --> 00:58:49.523
Neither one
should take very long.

1206
00:58:49.558 --> 00:58:51.558
[Allen] Actually. Michelle and I
have a lot to talk about.

1207
00:58:51.593 --> 00:58:53.065
Would you like to step outside?

1208
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.430
I was wondering if you had
a place I might feel safe?

1209
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.400
Mom. show Allen's father around.

1210
00:58:58.435 --> 00:58:59.709
Oh! Of course.

1211
00:58:59.744 --> 00:59:01.810
You will love him.

1212
00:59:01.845 --> 00:59:03.273
What a thing to say. honey.

1213
00:59:03.308 --> 00:59:05.143
What a thing to say. Hi.

1214
00:59:05.178 --> 00:59:06.947
Um. here.

1215
00:59:07.576 --> 00:59:08.619
Um...

1216
00:59:09.611 --> 00:59:11.446
Just. uh... Um...

1217
00:59:13.417 --> 00:59:15.890
You didn't tell me
that you have children.

1218
00:59:15.925 --> 00:59:18.090
You told me your son
was six years old.

1219
00:59:18.125 --> 00:59:19.828
He was once.

1220
00:59:19.863 --> 00:59:23.095
And you told me
that you were 54.

1221
00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:25.834
-I was once.
-Oh!

1222
00:59:25.869 --> 00:59:27.495
So. what are you now?

1223
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:28.430
Sixty-seven.

1224
00:59:28.465 --> 00:59:30.465
Oh. 67!

1225
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:33.435
Yeah. yeah.
I'll be 68 last year.

1226
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:36.812
Oh. no!
I was making it with a corpse.

1227
00:59:36.847 --> 00:59:39.914
Oh. lovely. Really lovely.

1228
00:59:39.949 --> 00:59:42.686
I mean. why would anyone
ever leave you?

1229
00:59:42.721 --> 00:59:47.119
Oh. you are not leaving me.

1230
00:59:51.895 --> 00:59:54.093
I'm already gone. Morticia.

1231
00:59:54.128 --> 00:59:57.030
[laughs] No. I think
we just had an off night.

1232
00:59:57.065 --> 00:59:59.494
No! Monica. what...

1233
01:00:00.068 --> 01:00:01.430
-Look... Look at me.
-Mmm.

1234
01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:02.772
We don't even like each other.

1235
01:00:02.807 --> 01:00:04.598
Why keep this going?

1236
01:00:04.633 --> 01:00:06.468
You don't understand
how difficult it is

1237
01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:08.470
to start a new
clandestine relationship.

1238
01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:11.176
You have to keep track
of what guy goes with what.

1239
01:00:11.211 --> 01:00:13.178
Sam thinks I'm angry at him.
I'm not angry at him.

1240
01:00:13.213 --> 01:00:14.608
I just lost track of him.

1241
01:00:14.643 --> 01:00:17.281
Well. you're not mad
at me either.

1242
01:00:17.316 --> 01:00:20.724
[curious instrumental
music plays]

1243
01:00:20.759 --> 01:00:22.319
You screwed up your own life.

1244
01:00:22.354 --> 01:00:24.992
You're the only one
who can figure out a way

1245
01:00:25.027 --> 01:00:27.456
to find some kind of happiness
or whatever you're looking for.

1246
01:00:27.491 --> 01:00:29.095
I don't care.

1247
01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:31.031
I'm still killing you.

1248
01:00:31.066 --> 01:00:33.033
[exasperated sigh] Monica.

1249
01:00:33.068 --> 01:00:35.068
nobody has to kill anyone.

1250
01:00:35.103 --> 01:00:37.268
Time is doing
a fine job of that.

1251
01:00:40.108 --> 01:00:42.669
-Grace...
-This is our backyard.

1252
01:00:42.704 --> 01:00:44.308
And this is where we go

1253
01:00:44.343 --> 01:00:46.783
when we want to come
to the back of the house.

1254
01:00:47.445 --> 01:00:48.609
Last night

1255
01:00:49.183 --> 01:00:51.722
was the sweetest night
I can remember.

1256
01:00:51.757 --> 01:00:55.154
Oh. well. for me too. Sam.

1257
01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:57.486
But we really can't
think about that now.

1258
01:00:57.521 --> 01:00:59.554
because what if the kids
get married?

1259
01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:01.655
Well. that'd be fantastic.

1260
01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:03.261
Things couldn't work out
any better.

1261
01:01:03.296 --> 01:01:06.033
We'd... We'd have excuses
to see each other all the time.

1262
01:01:06.068 --> 01:01:07.265
Oh. Mmm.

1263
01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:09.707
Is that incest?
I mean... It's...

1264
01:01:11.403 --> 01:01:13.535
Grace. I think

1265
01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:16.637
fate meant us to be together.

1266
01:01:17.739 --> 01:01:21.213
Look. last night was the best
night I've had in a long time.

1267
01:01:21.248 --> 01:01:24.381
But I want to hear those words
and feel those feelings

1268
01:01:24.416 --> 01:01:26.119
with my husband.

1269
01:01:27.089 --> 01:01:28.484
[sighs]

1270
01:01:30.554 --> 01:01:33.093
Last night. I had feelings
about my marriage too.

1271
01:01:33.128 --> 01:01:34.721
Mmm. What?

1272
01:01:34.756 --> 01:01:36.426
I hate my wife.

1273
01:01:36.461 --> 01:01:37.966
-You do not.
-I hate her guts.

1274
01:01:38.001 --> 01:01:39.231
Why would you say that?

1275
01:01:39.266 --> 01:01:41.134
-I live with her.
-Sam!

1276
01:01:41.807 --> 01:01:43.367
Because she hates me.

1277
01:01:43.402 --> 01:01:47.107
There's too much love in you
to hate anybody.

1278
01:01:47.142 --> 01:01:49.406
And there is too much
love in you

1279
01:01:49.441 --> 01:01:50.979
to not have it returned.

1280
01:01:51.014 --> 01:01:52.915
Let me return it. Grace.

1281
01:01:53.918 --> 01:01:55.313
[sighs]

1282
01:02:06.788 --> 01:02:08.326
We live a long time.

1283
01:02:08.361 --> 01:02:10.427
And we'll have kids.

1284
01:02:10.462 --> 01:02:12.099
We'll watch them grow.

1285
01:02:12.134 --> 01:02:13.771
And we'll be 50.

1286
01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.598
Please understand that
that's a good thing.

1287
01:02:16.633 --> 01:02:19.337
I understand it's a good thing
when we're us.

1288
01:02:19.372 --> 01:02:21.141
But. Michelle. they were us.

1289
01:02:21.176 --> 01:02:22.769
They believe what you believe.

1290
01:02:22.804 --> 01:02:24.980
They believed they wouldn't
lose their minds.

1291
01:02:26.115 --> 01:02:27.917
All I've been asking

1292
01:02:27.952 --> 01:02:30.821
is what happens to us
on the way to them.

1293
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:35.584
Do we wake up

1294
01:02:35.619 --> 01:02:37.091
on some cloudy Tuesday

1295
01:02:37.126 --> 01:02:41.128
and we're just not excited
by each other anymore?

1296
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:44.934
You will always
be excited by me.

1297
01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:47.200
Look at me.
I'm on my little bed.

1298
01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.981
Don't get on my bed
looking like that.

1299
01:02:59.808 --> 01:03:01.610
I got dressed for your parents.

1300
01:03:01.645 --> 01:03:03.744
My mother wears turtlenecks.
Get it off.

1301
01:03:05.891 --> 01:03:08.815
Get it off. Get it off!

1302
01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:11.686
[both laughing]

1303
01:03:15.098 --> 01:03:18.330
You don't touch me anymore.
remember?

1304
01:03:18.365 --> 01:03:20.233
Oh. yeah.

1305
01:03:29.871 --> 01:03:31.574
Now you can get in bed with me.

1306
01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:48.228
Don't say anything.

1307
01:03:48.725 --> 01:03:49.900
Just don't.

1308
01:03:54.236 --> 01:03:57.105
Do we spend the greater part of
our lives as crazy as they are?

1309
01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:00.669
Do you really think
they're crazy?

1310
01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:03.375
[Sam and Grace
argue indistinctly]

1311
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:05.245
Because I don't.

1312
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.512
I had feelings last night.

1313
01:04:08.547 --> 01:04:11.086
I didn't know
I was still capable

1314
01:04:11.121 --> 01:04:13.187
of having feelings like that.

1315
01:04:13.222 --> 01:04:14.452
Yeah?

1316
01:04:14.487 --> 01:04:16.960
There's only one possible
thing we can do.

1317
01:04:16.995 --> 01:04:18.720
Forget it ever happened.

1318
01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:21.261
You and me.

1319
01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:24.561
-Tahiti.
-Oh. so I'm way off here.

1320
01:04:24.596 --> 01:04:26.695
This isn't coincidence.

1321
01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.400
Things happen on purpose

1322
01:04:28.435 --> 01:04:30.732
so that we can figure out
what to do with our lives.

1323
01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:32.899
And our lives have led us here.

1324
01:04:32.934 --> 01:04:34.439
It's not real.

1325
01:04:34.474 --> 01:04:37.178
Sam! This isn't real.

1326
01:04:38.511 --> 01:04:41.116
Wouldn't you want this
with a nice. younger woman?

1327
01:04:41.151 --> 01:04:43.712
Well. my wife
is younger than me.

1328
01:04:43.747 --> 01:04:47.089
So. what I've learned
from that is... no.

1329
01:04:47.124 --> 01:04:48.618
And she's real.

1330
01:04:48.653 --> 01:04:50.917
She's as real as it gets.

1331
01:04:50.952 --> 01:04:53.260
But forgetting last night
happened isn't real.

1332
01:04:53.295 --> 01:04:54.822
because it did.

1333
01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:57.726
What's real is that it did.

1334
01:04:57.761 --> 01:05:00.102
I mean. what do you think
happened last night?

1335
01:05:00.137 --> 01:05:03.105
Sam. nothing happened.

1336
01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:04.502
Everything happened.

1337
01:05:04.537 --> 01:05:07.604
We talked. We had conversation.

1338
01:05:07.639 --> 01:05:10.937
When's the last time
you really talked to someone?

1339
01:05:10.972 --> 01:05:14.413
We shared the intimacy
that matters the most

1340
01:05:14.448 --> 01:05:17.713
because I think that
by not touching each other.

1341
01:05:19.123 --> 01:05:20.815
we touched each other.

1342
01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.656
And... it's what I want. Grace.

1343
01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:29.560
-Don't you?
-[sighs]

1344
01:05:31.366 --> 01:05:33.927
I grew up with them.
I watched them stay together

1345
01:05:33.962 --> 01:05:36.666
while all my friends' parents
fell apart.

1346
01:05:36.701 --> 01:05:38.140
I admired it.

1347
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:39.977
I've watched mine too.

1348
01:05:40.705 --> 01:05:42.012
I can only go by what I've seen.

1349
01:05:42.047 --> 01:05:44.212
And if that
is built into the deal.

1350
01:05:45.347 --> 01:05:48.183
will we be smart enough
to recognize it when it comes?

1351
01:05:48.218 --> 01:05:49.844
Will we recognize

1352
01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:52.451
how easy it is to arrive at
a place where I'm not allowed

1353
01:05:52.486 --> 01:05:55.322
to say "I love you" even though
I really think I do.

1354
01:05:56.325 --> 01:05:57.819
Allen.

1355
01:05:57.854 --> 01:06:00.822
We're so good together.
What are you doing?

1356
01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:03.363
I don't want it to happen to us.

1357
01:06:04.498 --> 01:06:06.531
So. help me out. okay?
You help me out.

1358
01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.864
How do you marry
a person you love?

1359
01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:12.075
How do you do that to somebody?

1360
01:06:13.078 --> 01:06:14.638
Wow.

1361
01:06:14.673 --> 01:06:16.046
You're angry at me?

1362
01:06:16.873 --> 01:06:18.411
How could I be?

1363
01:06:19.216 --> 01:06:22.019
This has nothing to do
with you and me at all.

1364
01:06:40.369 --> 01:06:43.568
Oh. my goodness.
Have you come to a decision?

1365
01:06:49.411 --> 01:06:51.543
I'm gonna try one last time.

1366
01:06:52.414 --> 01:06:53.875
Don't let what
you don't know is coming

1367
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:56.119
get in the way of what
you know we have now.

1368
01:06:57.287 --> 01:06:58.748
I do know what's coming.

1369
01:06:59.817 --> 01:07:01.256
I understand
there's gonna be easy parts.

1370
01:07:01.291 --> 01:07:03.225
like our wedding day and
the birthdays of our children.

1371
01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.227
and I understand we're gonna
be all over each other

1372
01:07:05.262 --> 01:07:06.426
for the first five years.

1373
01:07:06.461 --> 01:07:07.988
Thanks for the image. kid.

1374
01:07:11.598 --> 01:07:13.268
But what about the hard parts?

1375
01:07:14.271 --> 01:07:15.930
What about the day
that we don't remember

1376
01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:18.471
we gave each other
the best parts of our lives?

1377
01:07:18.506 --> 01:07:22.244
Because...
Because we're too busy

1378
01:07:22.279 --> 01:07:24.873
blaming each other for being
two middle-aged potatoes.

1379
01:07:24.908 --> 01:07:26.215
Oh. God.

1380
01:07:26.250 --> 01:07:28.580
Honesty can't hurt us.
So. you make me see.

1381
01:07:28.615 --> 01:07:31.088
What keeps that from being
the rest of our lives?

1382
01:07:33.257 --> 01:07:34.982
You're wrong
about the easy part.

1383
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:36.918
The easiest thing we could do

1384
01:07:36.953 --> 01:07:38.326
is smash this up and move on

1385
01:07:38.361 --> 01:07:40.163
and keep asking ourselves
the same questions

1386
01:07:40.198 --> 01:07:41.494
but with other people.

1387
01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:44.728
And if I do...

1388
01:07:44.763 --> 01:07:47.500
If I do find somebody else.
the difference will be

1389
01:07:47.535 --> 01:07:49.997
that I already knew you.

1390
01:07:50.967 --> 01:07:53.440
You will be my frame of
reference for loving somebody.

1391
01:07:53.475 --> 01:07:56.278
and I will compare them to you
and they will fail.

1392
01:07:57.215 --> 01:07:58.841
Why would you do that to me?

1393
01:08:00.647 --> 01:08:04.880
And if we do someday
have children with someone else.

1394
01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:08.488
your little girl
won't look like me.

1395
01:08:08.523 --> 01:08:10.754
You won't be able
to see me and everything

1396
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:12.294
we've gone through
over the years in her face.

1397
01:08:12.329 --> 01:08:13.823
And when she finds her person.

1398
01:08:13.858 --> 01:08:15.792
it'll never remind you of what
you and I had together.

1399
01:08:18.797 --> 01:08:21.369
That's how we hang onto the best
parts of our lives. Allen.

1400
01:08:21.404 --> 01:08:23.635
That's what saves us.

1401
01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:26.341
[gentle guitar music playing]

1402
01:08:30.347 --> 01:08:31.874
Jump with me.

1403
01:08:34.813 --> 01:08:37.616
How can you ask me to promise
you we won't go crazy later?

1404
01:08:37.651 --> 01:08:39.354
You're crazy now.

1405
01:08:43.921 --> 01:08:45.657
Unless you found something.

1406
01:08:46.429 --> 01:08:48.726
Have you finally found
something wrong with me?

1407
01:08:49.498 --> 01:08:51.025
You've had enough time.
so just tell me.

1408
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:54.501
Just tell me. What's wrong with
this girl right here. right now?

1409
01:08:59.706 --> 01:09:01.101
We're us. Allen.

1410
01:09:02.577 --> 01:09:04.346
Nobody else.

1411
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:10.077
And I will miss you
for the rest of my life.

1412
01:09:12.686 --> 01:09:14.752
Honey. come on...

1413
01:09:16.525 --> 01:09:18.085
Allen...

1414
01:09:20.628 --> 01:09:23.057
Go after her. please.

1415
01:09:24.962 --> 01:09:28.436
No. he's gotta do this
by himself. buddy.

1416
01:09:30.968 --> 01:09:33.705
[gentle piano music playing]

1417
01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:37.742
Nothing.

1418
01:09:40.549 --> 01:09:42.483
There's nothing
the matter with you.

1419
01:09:45.587 --> 01:09:47.917
I've never not ever
found one thing wrong.

1420
01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:59.093
You raised the most wonderful
person I know.

1421
01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:01.403
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.

1422
01:10:02.307 --> 01:10:03.999
And she's my best friend.

1423
01:10:06.674 --> 01:10:08.575
I don't care
what she does to me.

1424
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:11.611
Now that's a good way
to go into this.

1425
01:10:26.991 --> 01:10:28.529
We did this to them?

1426
01:10:30.027 --> 01:10:31.631
Mostly you.

1427
01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:35.965
I always wondered why
babies are born so helpless

1428
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.574
and why we get them
when they can't do anything.

1429
01:10:40.609 --> 01:10:44.006
And I always thought
that was for us.

1430
01:10:44.041 --> 01:10:47.449
So that we'd look back
when they grew up.

1431
01:10:47.484 --> 01:10:51.145
and be proud that we taught them
everything that they knew.

1432
01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.422
Because they didn't
know anything.

1433
01:10:53.457 --> 01:10:57.756
But it wasn't for us
at all. was it?

1434
01:10:57.791 --> 01:10:59.021
It's for them.

1435
01:10:59.892 --> 01:11:01.628
It's to keep them from realizing

1436
01:11:01.663 --> 01:11:05.401
that we don't know what we're
doing for as long as possible.

1437
01:11:06.063 --> 01:11:08.063
[sighs] But you know what?

1438
01:11:08.868 --> 01:11:11.066
They figure it out anyway.

1439
01:11:12.872 --> 01:11:14.135
[Howard chuckles softly]

1440
01:11:16.678 --> 01:11:18.139
We knew what we were doing.

1441
01:11:18.977 --> 01:11:20.141
You heard him.

1442
01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:24.354
We've raised
an incredible daughter.

1443
01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:27.280
I want another chance.

1444
01:11:27.315 --> 01:11:28.721
What?

1445
01:11:28.756 --> 01:11:30.591
I would get it right this time.

1446
01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.161
We got a lot of it right.

1447
01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:41.965
No. Didn't you see her?

1448
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.737
She's a ballerina
and I missed it.

1449
01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.543
[sighs] Okay.

1450
01:11:49.612 --> 01:11:51.546
Well. we can't do it again.

1451
01:11:51.581 --> 01:11:53.647
You get one ride.

1452
01:11:53.682 --> 01:11:55.913
-And one ride only.
-Uh-huh.

1453
01:11:55.948 --> 01:11:58.245
We've done what we've done.

1454
01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.049
Well. why didn't you
just stop me

1455
01:12:00.084 --> 01:12:02.315
from becoming a potato?

1456
01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:04.053
-[both laugh]
-You're not a potato.

1457
01:12:04.088 --> 01:12:06.187
I am. I am. I'm a potato.

1458
01:12:06.222 --> 01:12:08.827
And it was your responsibility
to stop me when

1459
01:12:08.862 --> 01:12:11.434
-I started turning into one.
-Grace. It...

1460
01:12:11.469 --> 01:12:13.502
But you weren't
paying attention.

1461
01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:15.163
[both sigh]

1462
01:12:15.198 --> 01:12:17.506
I'm sorry I made you
feel that way.

1463
01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:21.037
I think my son
is absolutely right.

1464
01:12:21.072 --> 01:12:22.071
About what?

1465
01:12:22.909 --> 01:12:25.745
Honesty cannot hurt us.

1466
01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.340
Sure it can.

1467
01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:30.112
Would everyone like to start out
with some little hot dogs?

1468
01:12:30.147 --> 01:12:32.455
-No.
-[Grace] I made them because

1469
01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:36.085
everyone likes them
and nothing bad has happened

1470
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.692
-when I make them.
-The four of us. for instance.

1471
01:12:38.727 --> 01:12:40.925
Have we really been honest
with each other?

1472
01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.290
-[both] Monica!
-Oh. right. You... You should...

1473
01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:45.226
-Probably take this. yeah.
-Yeah. it's my house.

1474
01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:47.569
-so I spoke up. but she's--
-My wife. so I guess--

1475
01:12:47.604 --> 01:12:49.065
On you. yeah.

1476
01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.902
-Unless you'd rather--
-No.

1477
01:12:50.937 --> 01:12:53.707
I. for one. have
absolutely no intention

1478
01:12:53.742 --> 01:12:55.709
of living out
the rest of my life

1479
01:12:55.744 --> 01:12:59.647
even remotely being thought of
as a potato.

1480
01:12:59.682 --> 01:13:01.143
Nobody thinks of you
as a potato.

1481
01:13:01.178 --> 01:13:02.650
Oh. really?
What do they think of me as?

1482
01:13:02.685 --> 01:13:04.784
That thing that
mashes the potato.

1483
01:13:04.819 --> 01:13:06.654
-[quiet chuckle]
-But I will be living

1484
01:13:06.689 --> 01:13:08.557
the rest of my life honestly.

1485
01:13:08.592 --> 01:13:11.659
And so. I don't want to talk
about tonight anymore.

1486
01:13:11.694 --> 01:13:13.254
I think she's right.

1487
01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:15.256
I think whatever happens.
the kids have this well in hand.

1488
01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:17.434
I want to talk about last night.

1489
01:13:18.668 --> 01:13:21.163
This evening is not about
what you want. Monica.

1490
01:13:21.198 --> 01:13:22.571
Oh. what's it about?

1491
01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:25.739
It's about Michelle and Allen.

1492
01:13:25.774 --> 01:13:27.807
and our part in the decision
they're making.

1493
01:13:27.842 --> 01:13:29.611
They've watched us
their whole lives.

1494
01:13:29.646 --> 01:13:31.910
They know who we are.
and they don't want to be us.

1495
01:13:31.945 --> 01:13:33.142
I don't want to be us either.

1496
01:13:33.177 --> 01:13:35.012
Monica. I'd like to talk to you.

1497
01:13:35.047 --> 01:13:36.783
You do?
You wanna talk to me. really?

1498
01:13:36.818 --> 01:13:38.752
Well. you go right ahead. Sam.

1499
01:13:38.787 --> 01:13:41.491
-Not here.
-Oh. Where would you prefer?

1500
01:13:41.526 --> 01:13:43.152
Someplace private.

1501
01:13:44.188 --> 01:13:45.957
The bedroom?
The bedroom's private.

1502
01:13:45.992 --> 01:13:48.355
Do you wanna talk in the bed...
May we borrow your bedroom?

1503
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.829
We're just gonna talk in it.

1504
01:13:49.864 --> 01:13:51.424
We don't kiss or do
anything like that anymore.

1505
01:13:51.459 --> 01:13:54.603
We used to kiss every night
before we went to bed.

1506
01:13:54.638 --> 01:13:57.298
We made a point of it.
and I liked that.

1507
01:13:57.333 --> 01:13:59.971
-[Sam sighs]
-It was hopeful.

1508
01:14:00.006 --> 01:14:01.170
What was it he said?

1509
01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:03.942
Do you even remember

1510
01:14:03.977 --> 01:14:07.044
that we gave each other
the best parts of our lives?

1511
01:14:07.079 --> 01:14:09.046
I remember everything.

1512
01:14:09.081 --> 01:14:11.279
But when you stop kissing
each other good night.

1513
01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:13.688
and you just say "goodnight"
or sometimes you don't say that.

1514
01:14:13.723 --> 01:14:16.383
and then you just turn out your
little light and roll over

1515
01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:18.187
and you leave me sitting there.

1516
01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:22.499
then it's necessary to go
elsewhere for hopeful.

1517
01:14:23.029 --> 01:14:24.292
Do you know what I'm saying?

1518
01:14:24.327 --> 01:14:27.328
-[all] No!
-Or look elsewhere

1519
01:14:27.363 --> 01:14:31.706
for a memorable evening
with the lights on.

1520
01:14:32.841 --> 01:14:35.039
What do you think I do at night

1521
01:14:35.074 --> 01:14:36.843
when I'm not at home. Sam?

1522
01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:38.746
I try not to think about it.

1523
01:14:38.781 --> 01:14:40.209
Oh. why don't you
think about it?

1524
01:14:40.244 --> 01:14:41.848
Because it doesn't matter to me.

1525
01:14:41.883 --> 01:14:44.818
Because I just want to
turn over and go to sleep.

1526
01:14:44.853 --> 01:14:46.182
Okay. you asked your question.

1527
01:14:46.217 --> 01:14:48.349
-You got your answer.
-Well. it matters to me.

1528
01:14:48.384 --> 01:14:50.857
It matters to me
what happened last night.

1529
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:56.357
So. in the continuing search
for a memorable evening.

1530
01:14:56.392 --> 01:14:58.865
I'm just gonna sparkle
this one up a little.

1531

No! It wasn't me.

1532
01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:02.462
I wasn't with him.

1533
01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:05.399
No. honey.
you don't have this right.

1534
01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:07.104
-What?
-I knew I'd get caught.

1535
01:15:07.139 --> 01:15:09.744
Next time. why don't I
just send invitations?

1536
01:15:10.615 --> 01:15:12.208
Why do you both
not have this right?

1537
01:15:13.376 --> 01:15:15.211
I was home in front
of the television.

1538
01:15:15.246 --> 01:15:17.444
and you know that. Howard.
and you know that.

1539
01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:20.084
Of course you were.
Of course I know that. Yeah.

1540
01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:24.253
I wasn't. Howard.

1541
01:15:24.288 --> 01:15:25.628
I wasn't home.

1542
01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:29.522
Grace. what the hell
are you talking about?

1543
01:15:29.557 --> 01:15:31.260
What the hell are you
talking about?

1544
01:15:31.295 --> 01:15:34.637
I'm talking about me and Grace.
What are you talking about?

1545
01:15:36.069 --> 01:15:38.575
Well. I was talking about
me and Howard.

1546
01:15:40.843 --> 01:15:43.239
But. obviously.
the news is elsewhere.

1547
01:15:43.274 --> 01:15:44.471
Howard!

1548
01:15:44.506 --> 01:15:46.781
Grace.
I made a terrible mistake.

1549
01:15:46.816 --> 01:15:48.508
I mean. obviously!
You know her now.

1550
01:15:49.852 --> 01:15:51.577
[screams]
How could you do this?!

1551
01:15:51.612 --> 01:15:53.447
How could I? How could you?

1552
01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.581
The same way you could.

1553
01:15:55.616 --> 01:15:57.660
And since when could you?

1554
01:15:57.695 --> 01:15:58.925
I could and I'm good at it.

1555
01:16:06.869 --> 01:16:09.001
I just killed you.
Now it's over.

1556
01:16:09.773 --> 01:16:11.564
Have a nice day.

[soft jazz instrumentals]

1559
01:16:20.641 --> 01:16:22.542
How long have you known my wife?

1560
01:16:23.886 --> 01:16:25.578
Four months.

1561
01:16:25.613 --> 01:16:26.656
How long have you?

1562
01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:28.955
One night.

1563
01:16:30.453 --> 01:16:31.859
Hardly seems fair.
