3
00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.491
We're getting several calls.
more than four shots heard…

4
00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.493
The shots were fired. and. uh…

5
00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.246
- They shot at you?
- They were shooting at me.

6
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.041
I just ducked down in the seat thinking.
"Oh. my God."

7
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.126
I don't even know if they hit the car.

8
00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.056
- What's the problem?
- The car came just barreling in.

9
00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.268
-It's a Honda Accord. And they came up--
- What color Honda?

10
00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.868
Someone's been shot
that's on the floor.

11
00:04:03.952 --> 00:04:05.620
It seems like she's not responding.

12
00:04:05.703 --> 00:04:07.038
Address is…

13
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:18.132
RP's going to be responding.
It looks like we have a victim.

14
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:22.387
Patrol. what's your twenty…?

15
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.358
Riverside Police Department.

16
00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:18.034
- You didn't hear any gunshots?
- We were inside tonight.

17
00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.036
You didn't hear anything
or see anything?

18
00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:22.288
- I wasn't here.
- No. I was asleep.

19
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:23.372
You were asleep?

20
00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.170
You didn't hear any gunshots?

21
00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:33.132
No. My wife said she heard.
you know. several pops. yeah.

22
00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:34.592
She didn't see anything?

23
00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:54.422
There's a lot of rumors running
around as to what might've happened.

24
00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:56.507
What are you thinking is…?

25
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:02.179
I'm thinking there's been a lot
of gang problems with that. uh. 5150.

26
00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:24.452
Rival Latino and Black gangs
involved in drug trafficking…

27
00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.928
Give me a full description of this--

28
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:09.056
He was young.
He was young. He was a kid.

29
00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:12.226
-But if I see him. I will know him.
- Okay.

30
00:15:35.851 --> 00:15:37.144
You doing okay. dude?

31
00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:46.904
I wasn't there.

32
00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:51.867
I know that you were. though.
I got somebody who identified you.

33
00:15:57.206 --> 00:16:02.002
We were at my house. and then we went
to his brother's girlfriend's house.

34
00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:18.143
Please!

35
00:16:21.105 --> 00:16:25.609
Let me go home!

36
00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:08.355
If you've got a teenager at home.

37
00:19:08.438 --> 00:19:10.774
chances are that he or she spends
a lot of time

38
00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:14.278
on the social networking website
called MySpace.com.

39
00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:25.789
With 66 million users nationwide.

40
00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:29.877
MySpace is one of the most popular
networking sites used by kids.

41
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.171
Most of the kids at my school use MySpace.

42
00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:34.131
You put pictures up.
Meet girls. meet guys.

43
00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:54.289
Where was Robert
when this happened?

44
00:22:54.373 --> 00:22:57.209
Robert? I don't know.
Robert had nothing to do with this.

45
00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:58.835
Sure. Sure.

46
00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.890
You were not in an SUV that night?

47
00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.433
- No.
- Absolutely not?

48
00:24:36.516 --> 00:24:38.852
I can't tell you how many people
saw two SUVs that night.

49
00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:42.981
Realize. Robert. that I am here
to help your family.

50
00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:44.065
That's all our jobs.

51
00:33:20.123 --> 00:33:23.501
That white truck. was there
anything that stood out about it?

52
00:33:23.584 --> 00:33:27.505
Like. was it lowered. or have some kind
of special rims on it. anything at all?

53
00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:30.216
It was an Expedition.
I don't know what make that is.

54
00:33:30.299 --> 00:33:32.218
- Okay.
- If that's a Ford or what.

55
00:34:43.998 --> 00:34:45.666
Okay. All right. Will.

56
00:34:46.375 --> 00:34:49.337
We'll get you right back here
once we're all finished up.

57
00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:54.634
You're doing your GED.
I know what that means.

58
00:34:54.717 --> 00:34:57.595
-What are you doing as far as the cooking?
- Pantry cook.

59
00:35:00.139 --> 00:35:03.059
That's cool. man.
That's better than what you were doing.

60
00:35:03.142 --> 00:35:04.477
- Yeah.
- Big time.

61
00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:10.817
You wanted a water. didn't you?
See if you can get one for him?

62
00:35:11.692 --> 00:35:13.194
-Sorry about that.
- No problem.

63
00:35:14.529 --> 00:35:17.865
Your name has popped up in a case
that I'm working. Okay?

64
00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:19.075
-Case?
- Yeah.

65
00:35:19.158 --> 00:35:21.452
In an investigation that I'm doing.

66
00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:23.079
What is it? Gang members. or…?

67
00:35:23.162 --> 00:35:27.375
Well. it's got to do with 5150.
There's a girl that got shot.

68
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.043
-Girl?
- Mm-hm.

69
00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:34.799
The thing that I need to ask you about.
though. is your… your car.

70
00:35:34.882 --> 00:35:38.886
Your Ford Expedition was identified
as being there.

71
00:35:39.512 --> 00:35:42.473
Was it mine?
With the license plates? I don't know.

72
00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:44.183
Yeah. your car was there.

73
00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:46.936
Uh-huh. When was this?

74
00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:48.229
Back in February.

75
00:35:51.941 --> 00:35:53.985
-Back in February?
- Mm-hm.

76
00:35:54.068 --> 00:35:55.027
I don't know.

77
00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:02.869
Yeah. you do. man.

78
00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:22.847
Nobody else in 5150 or anyone else around
in that area drives that car but you.

79
00:36:23.389 --> 00:36:25.975
Every time I talk about Jokes.
it's always that car.

80
00:36:26.058 --> 00:36:28.436
-Jokes? Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh. That's you.

81
00:36:28.936 --> 00:36:32.982
Now is the time that you really need
to be straight up with me

82
00:36:33.065 --> 00:36:35.234
because I am your only ally right now.

83
00:36:37.612 --> 00:36:40.406
The problem is if you sit and tell me.
"I wasn't there…"

84
00:36:40.489 --> 00:36:42.700
All right. like. I'll say the truth. but--

85
00:36:42.783 --> 00:36:44.994
That's what I want you to tell me.
The truth.

86
00:36:45.077 --> 00:36:47.163
But I wasn't involved in it.
It just happened.

87
00:36:47.246 --> 00:36:49.332
Tell me. Tell me what happened.

88
00:36:54.253 --> 00:36:56.714
I don't know.
We were just cruising.

89
00:36:56.797 --> 00:36:58.507
Like. driving around by Rutland.

90
00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:00.968
Rutland Park?
Is that 5150 territory.

91
00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:03.054
or isn't that close to MD territory?

92
00:37:03.137 --> 00:37:05.056
Yes. that's MD's territory.

93
00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:07.308
And everybody's piled
into your Expedition?

94
00:37:07.391 --> 00:37:10.770
It was full.
probably like seven people in the car.

95
00:37:11.812 --> 00:37:14.649
Then this white Expedition passed quick.
almost hit my truck.

96
00:37:14.732 --> 00:37:16.734
He cuts us off. like. whoosh.

97
00:37:16.817 --> 00:37:19.237
Almost. like.
this close to hitting the truck.

98
00:37:26.118 --> 00:37:28.454
And then they started…

99
00:37:28.537 --> 00:37:31.999
The… The white Expedition started shooting
at the car. at my truck.

100
00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:34.043
- They shot at your truck?
- Yeah.

101
00:37:34.126 --> 00:37:37.255
I was gonna take off.
and Lil Huero's like. "Just stop."

102
00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:38.839
-He got out.
- Okay.

103
00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.549
So Little Huero gets out. right?

104
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:45.221
Where did he walk to?
Did he walk toward--?

105
00:37:45.304 --> 00:37:48.432
I don't know. I started ducking.
There was bullets flying everywhere.

106
00:37:50.601 --> 00:37:53.729
That's pretty ballsy to get out
if somebody is shooting at you.

107
00:37:53.813 --> 00:37:55.690
Pretty ballsy to get out of the car.

108
00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:58.859
He's crazy. He's psycho. It's weird.

109
00:38:00.403 --> 00:38:03.364
What did you see in the car
with the girl inside when it went by?

110
00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:04.949
Did it look like it got hit?

111
00:38:05.032 --> 00:38:07.034
-Yeah. it did.
- It have bullet holes in it?

112
00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:08.828
No. like the window was shattered.

113
00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:10.079
Which window?

114
00:38:10.579 --> 00:38:13.874
The front… The front.
like. um. passenger side.

115
00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:19.380
Okay. And you said that you were
getting shot at? Did your car get hit?

116
00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:22.550
No. Um. I don't think it got hit.

117
00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:24.844
That's pretty close
for them not to hit you.

118
00:38:24.927 --> 00:38:27.346
-I'd have thought you've been hit.
-I don't know.

119
00:38:47.116 --> 00:38:49.243
Okay. when did you see Little Huero again?

120
00:38:49.368 --> 00:38:52.413
I never saw him. I never heard from him
or saw him again.

121
00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:53.414
- No?
-Mm-mm.

122
00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:13.392
Why don't we take a break?
Mind hanging out for a few minutes?

123
00:39:13.476 --> 00:39:15.186
-Okay.
- Okay. be right back.

124
00:39:16.979 --> 00:39:20.191
-Is this. like. all gonna stay here?
- What's that?

125
00:39:20.274 --> 00:39:22.693
Is anybody else going to find out
about this?

126
00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:25.571
- Am I gonna go run and tell?
-I don't wanna get killed.

127
00:39:25.654 --> 00:39:28.074
I ain't gonna tell Little Huero about it.

128
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:50.971
-San Bernadino or--?
-Could you drop me off at Parkview?

129
00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.640
Parkview? I can do that.

130
00:42:17.993 --> 00:42:22.289
We lived very peacefully there.
Very peacefully.

131
00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:26.377
There were never any problems.
nothing. nothing.

132
00:42:27.336 --> 00:42:33.676
All those guys were his friends because
they were all from the same neighborhood.

133
00:42:33.759 --> 00:42:34.969
They were his friends.

134
00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:38.138
They seemed so innocent.

135
00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:42.393
They showed me respect.
They didn't use bad language.

136
00:42:43.686 --> 00:42:48.232
And I had no idea
what a big problem that was.

137
00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:11.500
I understand how the streets work.
You want to handle this.

138
00:45:11.583 --> 00:45:13.085
Your brothers want to handle this shit.

139
00:45:13.168 --> 00:45:15.254
-Enough harm's been done.
- Right.

140
00:45:15.337 --> 00:45:18.382
You don't need to go back to jail.
Your brothers don't need to.

141
00:45:18.465 --> 00:45:20.801
Your mom doesn't need
this kind of anguish. so…

142
00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:35.983
Are your sons. uh. wanting
to take care of this themselves?

143
00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.985
- No.
- No? Okay. Good.

144
00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:40.070
Yeah. we don't… We don't need that.

145
00:47:20.754 --> 00:47:23.382
Bangin' on the mic and shit. MySpace…

146
00:54:17.128 --> 00:54:18.421
There was a shooting.

147
00:54:19.381 --> 00:54:21.424
I don't know
if people were shooting at you.

148
00:54:21.508 --> 00:54:23.718
I don't know if you
were shooting somebody.

149
00:54:23.802 --> 00:54:25.428
If I was involved in a shooting.

150
00:54:25.512 --> 00:54:27.722
-I think they shot at us.
- I would remember.

151
00:54:37.732 --> 00:54:40.652
You told me you didn't
know anything. and you weren't in the car.

152
00:54:40.735 --> 00:54:42.112
Now I know that's all lies.

153
00:54:42.195 --> 00:54:44.572
'Cause you're telling me
that my brother's over here.

154
00:54:44.656 --> 00:54:46.032
then you let us talk a bit.

155
00:54:46.116 --> 00:54:49.327
Then he's coming telling me.
"You gotta tell them this and this."

156
00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:53.206
-"'Cause then he's gonna lock you up."
- He was being honest about it.

157
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:56.042
He didn't hide anything.
He said. "Know what? I was there."

158
00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:04.009
- Is this the front of the car here?
-Yeah. This is the front of the car.

159
00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:05.927
Okay.

160
00:55:06.511 --> 00:55:10.682
This is me. This is my brother.
We're the only ones in the back.

161
00:55:10.765 --> 00:55:12.475
- You're in the very. very back?
-Yeah.

162
00:55:26.906 --> 00:55:30.744
He fired one kind of high.
and then he pointed at the car.

163
00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:32.495
-Yeah.
-Bam. bam. bam. bam.

164
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:35.373
-And those hit the car.
-Those hit the car. Okay.

165
00:55:47.719 --> 00:55:49.721
Let's see if we can talk with him.

166
00:56:14.954 --> 00:56:16.748
The other way. you're lying to me.

167
00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:20.460
So you want to lie to me
in the middle of a murder investigation?

168
00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:21.878
Roll the dice.

169
00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:24.756
Or tell the truth.
and tell me what actually happened.

170
00:56:24.839 --> 00:56:28.593
-It doesn't get any more black and white.
-I know I didn't kill anybody.

171
00:56:28.676 --> 00:56:30.637
So. fine. Tell me what happened.

172
00:58:53.488 --> 00:58:55.823
Sir. what is your address. please?

173
00:58:55.907 --> 00:58:59.077
3445 Glasgow.

174
00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:01.246
A bunch of kids were dressed in black.

175
00:59:01.913 --> 00:59:05.291
Maybe they weren't kids. I couldn't tell
because they were so far away.

176
00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:08.378
Okay. and how many kids
are you talking about?

177
00:59:08.461 --> 00:59:10.004
About ten. 12.

178
00:59:10.088 --> 00:59:13.841
My husband called the police. and they
asked. "Are you going to stay there?"

179
00:59:18.263 --> 00:59:19.764
What is your name. sir?

180
00:59:19.847 --> 00:59:21.558
My name is William Lemus.

181
00:59:21.641 --> 00:59:23.977
but I do not want to get involved in this.

182
00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.979
You don't want the officer
to knock?

183
00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:26.980
Of course not.

184
00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:29.107
Because we were able to leave and we left.

185
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:31.818
But we did not know
what they were going to do.

186
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:50.461
All the sentimental things.

187
00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:54.674
But since I am Christian. the Bible says.

188
00:59:54.757 --> 00:59:57.510
"The thoughts of man
are not the same as those of God."

189
01:00:06.227 --> 01:00:09.564
All right. Manuel. your dad said
you wanna talk more?

190
01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:11.065
-Yeah.
- Okay. To remind you…

191
01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.910
Do you remember
more of what happened that night?

192
01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:26.080
I can tell you the whole story now.

193
01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:26.998
Okay.

194
01:00:28.082 --> 01:00:30.627
The beginning was that. my friends.

195
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.671
I don't know about what time.
late at night.

196
01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:36.007
they came knocking at our house.

197
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:44.135
- Out. like outside?
- Yeah.

198
01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:46.512
-Lil Huero.
- It's just Lil Huero?

199
01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:47.805
-Just him.
- Okay.

200
01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:58.524
I stood up. and I even turned around
so he could see from behind.

201
01:02:58.608 --> 01:02:59.609
I wasn't wearing a wire.

202
01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:05.907
He would be on the passenger side.
but in the seat behind.

203
01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:16.042
Police Department! Search warrant!

204
01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:23.299
Police carried out a series
of gang association search warrants.

205
01:03:30.014 --> 01:03:32.558
"This was a reign of terror."
said the district attorney.

206
01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.894
"I think we took the gang apart
on Wednesday."

207
01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.965
and a part of our community
and return it to the rightful owners.

208
01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:17.228
that eventually helped
lead police to arrests.

209
01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:39.000
You're looking at a murder charge.
and you're that…

210
01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:41.377
Are you that confident?
I'm looking at you.

211
01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.920
I can tell you're not confident.

212
01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:46.257
No. I'm sure about this.
I'm thinking about other things.

213
01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.509
What are you thinking about?
Thinking about Anna?

214
01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.429
-That kid she's carrying?
-Yup.

215
01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:58.060
Dude. there's a lot of stuff
going on in your life right now.

216
01:04:58.144 --> 01:04:59.562
How far along is she right now?

217
01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.190
-Like. four months.
- Four months?

218
01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:05.484
-Little boy or little girl? Do you know?
-No.

219
01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:07.695
How is she doing?

220
01:05:08.487 --> 01:05:09.405
She's good.

221
01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:14.911
You got a four-month-old on the way.

222
01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:18.998
Set the example and step up
and be a man about this.

223
01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:22.919
You made a mistake.
Everybody makes mistakes.

224
01:05:23.002 --> 01:05:24.837
Some of them are bigger than others.

225
01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:30.259
But right here. right now is the chance
for you to make a change.

226
01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.930
For you to be a different kind
of a person. Julio.

227
01:05:37.808 --> 01:05:39.644
You want to sleep on it tonight?

228
01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:42.730
No. I just want to…
Yeah. I want a freaking lawyer.

229
01:05:42.813 --> 01:05:46.067
I want you to give me my rights.
I want somebody to be right here.

230
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:49.487
So now you want a lawyer?
You can have an attorney if you want one.

231
01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:51.155
You wanna do that? That's fine.

232
01:05:52.156 --> 01:05:55.826
-But now you got a lot to think about.
-You don't understand me anyways.

233
01:12:20.252 --> 01:12:22.921
Who's that? You guys. get down!

234
01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:26.633
I think they're coming up the road again.
Get behind the car. Ben. Hurry!

235
01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:29.636
Wait. Ma'am. hold on.
Do you think he was a teenager?

236
01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:41.565
-He was shorter than me.
- Thin. medium. heavy build?

237
01:12:41.648 --> 01:12:43.817
Uh. He… uh… Very…

238
01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.152
Oh gosh. uh…

239
01:12:51.116 --> 01:12:54.870
My heart's still pounding. I'm just like.
"Oh my God. I can't believe this."

240
01:14:42.227 --> 01:14:45.731
By the time he hears the gunshot.
he comes outside of the car.

241
01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:46.899
He's coming out.

242
01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:52.654
And at this time.
I hear several other gunshot noises.

243
01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:10.964
You've seen Little Huero on meth?

244
01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:13.091
- Yeah.
- You've never smoked with him?

245
01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:15.177
Never smoked with him.
never seen him do it.

246
01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.013
but I know he's on it
because of his eyeballs are all opened up.

247
01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:30.817
So I saw when Little Huero
dumped the first shot.

248
01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:33.153
I didn't see the other shots.
I saw the first one.
