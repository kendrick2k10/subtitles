00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.533

Go. River.

I'm River Tamland.
wishing you a very

18
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.834
Merry Christmas Eve.

19
00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:46.300
Here's what's happening
in your neck of the woods.

20
00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:49.500
(lighthearted music)

21
00:00:58.367 --> 00:00:59.033
- Hey!

22
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.433
- Let me guess.

23
00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:01.900
A Redeye. and one
chocolate croissant?

24
00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:02.734
- Actually. no.

25
00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:04.266
- What?

26
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.867
Your order is my one constant
in an unstable world.

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.567
- I'm just grabbing some
goodies for my crew.

28
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.100
Can I get a cranberry sage pie.

29
00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:14.667
and a dozen of the
reindeer cookies?

30
00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:17.033
- Christmas Eve plans?

31
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.567
- I do this Christmas Eve party

32
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.567
with my friends every year.

33
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.934
- That's so nice.

34
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:21.967
Oh. hey.

35
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.567
We just made these fresh.

36
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.600
Orange cranberry
white chocolate chip.

37
00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:27.533
Do you want to try?

38
00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:29.734
- Oh. thank you. but
I'm on a mission.

39
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.834
- How about you?

40
00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:34.033
- I mean. how could I say no?

41
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.100
(chuckling)

42
00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:36.600
- What can I get for you?

43
00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:38.900
- It's my first time here.

44
00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.200
Surprise me.

45
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.300
- Hey Case. I'll be
in the office in five.

46
00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:43.233
Thanks.

47
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:45.233
- Ugh. that's to...

48
00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:46.567
Wow.

49
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.433
There's no such thing
as a bad free cookie.

50
00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:48.800
but that is a
really good cookie.

51
00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:50.033
(laughing)

52
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:50.900
- Thank you.

53
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.400
- Hi. I'm alone. I'm from
Imperium National Bank.

54
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:57.467
We are sponsoring
the New Year's Plunge

55
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.767
on New Year's Day. and the
crowd of human popsicles

56
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.133
is gonna be in desperate
need of warm drinks.

57
00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.467
(chuckling)

58
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.767
We would take care of
the booth. the signage.

59
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.467
there's guaranteed
to be a crowd.

60
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.400
It's like free marketing.

61
00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:10.934
I mean. who doesn't
want that. right?

62
00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.667
- Said the guy in marketing.

63
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.667
(chuckling)

64
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.967
- Got me.

65
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.533
- Um. yeah. let me see
if I can get the staff.

66
00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:19.834
but that sounds like
a great opportunity.

67
00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:20.633
- Yeah?

68
00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:21.667
Great. good.

69
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.633
You won't regret it.

70
00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:23.867
- Cinnamon latte?

71
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.533
- That sounds really good.

72
00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:26.700
Take care.

73
00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:27.967
- [Barista] Thanks so much.

74
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.600
- [Kelly] Okay. let's hear some
of those big segment ideas.

75
00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:33.500
- Oh. how about a 25
foot tall snowman?

76
00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:35.533
- Do we have any
footage of the snowman?

77
00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:37.800
- Uh. it violates
several zoning laws.

78
00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:39.967
and they're still trying
to get ahold of more snow.

79
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.800
- That's gonna be a pass.

80
00:02:42.533 --> 00:02:44.467
- What about favorite
ways to tailgate

81
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.500
from this past football season?

82
00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:47.667
- We can't definitely
state what toppings

83
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.533
make a real Wisconsin
brat. the fans will riot.

84
00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:53.100
- That's true. I can see
the emails pouring in now.

85
00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:54.800
- I could always do
reporter on the street

86
00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:56.667
and ask them what their
New Year's resolution is.

87
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.133
- Feels very similar to
what we did last year.

88
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.600
But what if we did a
reoccurring segment.

89
00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:06.900
Pick someone. and
then follow them

90
00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:09.266
with their resolution
through the month of January.

91
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.033
- I like that.

92
00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:12.367
It's got depth. visual appeal.

93
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.533
- Great.

94
00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:16.667
Casey. why don't you start
interviewing candidates?

95
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.867
Put the word out on
the street. online.

96
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.400
you know. I want people
who are willing to jump in.

97
00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.066
Real go-getters.

98
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.166
- You got it.

99
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.500
- Good one.

100
00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:27.100
(lighthearted music)

101
00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:28.734
- This year. we
posted record highs

102
00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:29.934
in customer satisfaction.

103
00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:31.266
By increasing our event budget.

104
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.567
we can do even better.

105
00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:35.533
I can do this.

106
00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:37.600
I'm telling you. this
is very achievable.

107
00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:38.934
with a slightly larger budget.

108
00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.567
- I'm intrigued.

109
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.166
But. I'm nervous your
team might already

110
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.667
be spread too thin.

111
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.000
The bank is already sponsoring
the New Year's Plunge.

112
00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:48.734
the Blizzard Obstacle
Course. the chili cook offs.

113
00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:50.000
It's a lot of events.

114
00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:51.233
- For good reason.

115
00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:52.834
Let's talk about
the magic of Santa.

116
00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:54.667
- Now. responses
to our surveys show

117
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.834
that sponsoring Santa
at the holiday market

118
00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:59.500
boosted good will towards
the bank substantially.

119
00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:01.567
- In fact. every
single time we partner

120
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.133
with a local business or event.

121
00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:05.734
surveys show that trust
in our bank increases.

122
00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:09.066
and so. with our most ambitious
sales goals ever this year--

123
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.934
- If they're going
to invest in us.

124
00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:13.166
we're gonna have to
invest in them too.

125
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.934
- It's good for them.
it's good for us.

126
00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.333
- It's good for everyone.

127
00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:18.567
(cheery Christmas music)

128
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.734
(chuckling)

129
00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:20.700
- All right.

130
00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:21.667
I look forward to
seeing what you can do

131
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.934
with an even bigger
budget next year.

132
00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.400
(knocking)

133
00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:28.900
- I can't believe
you pulled that off.

134
00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:30.900
- We pulled this off.

135
00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:31.934
Can I take you out to celebrate?

136
00:04:32.066 --> 00:04:33.166
- Another time?

137
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.500
I need to finish
those vendor emails

138
00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:36.066
so I can head over
to my mom's place.

139
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.266
- Momma Jones.

140
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.734
Tell her her favorite
son says hello.

141
00:04:38.867 --> 00:04:40.500
- And you two love that joke.

142
00:04:40.633 --> 00:04:41.767
(laughing)

143
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.066
- Hey. get outta
here. I'll do them.

144
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.266
Trust me. I'm much more
scared of Momma Jones

145
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.500
than vendor agreements.

146
00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:47.300
(laughing)

147
00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:48.834
- Oh. you're the best.

148
00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:50.333
And you tell the whole family
I said Merry Christmas.

149
00:04:50.467 --> 00:04:51.166
- Merry Christmas!

150
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.333
(phone ringing)

151
00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:53.900
Hey. sis.

152
00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:56.800
Whoa. Sheila. Sheila.
slow down. slow down.

153
00:04:56.934 --> 00:04:57.967
Okay.

154
00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:00.967
Right. okay. I'm gonna get some.

155
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.934
I'm gonna pick it up. yeah.

156
00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:03.367
I'm gonna get it on
my way out of here.

157
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.367
it's literally gonna
take me two minutes.

158
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.266
Okay?

159
00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:07.500
Yes. I will.

160
00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:08.500
Okay.

161
00:05:08.633 --> 00:05:09.734
I'll see you then. buh-bye.

162
00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:14.033
(lighthearted Christmas music)

163
00:05:15.266 --> 00:05:17.033
- [Kelly] Let's see...

164
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.367
- You really will do anything

165
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.066
for the best story. huh?

166
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.667
- The pre-tape still needs work.

167
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.300
but I didn't want to keep
the crew from their families.

168
00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:26.900
- And you?

169
00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:27.734
Your mom's not gonna fill
your stocking with coal

170
00:05:27.867 --> 00:05:28.967
if you're late?

171
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.867
- She knows how
crazy things can get.

172
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.667
- I normally drive
out Christmas morning.

173
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.967
- Just tell me
you're not spending

174
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.100
Christmas Eve here. alone.

175
00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:38.166
- No. no.

176
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.033
I do a Secret Santa
things with my friends.

177
00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:41.734
I'm headed there after this.

178
00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:42.867
- Look.

179
00:05:44.934 --> 00:05:47.200
I know the beginning of
this year was tough. okay?

180
00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:49.834
Ratings were down.
and the executives

181
00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:52.233
came down hard on us.

182
00:05:52.367 --> 00:05:53.033
- We rose to the occasion.

183
00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:53.967
- Look at us now.

184
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.934
Number one in Milwaukee.

185
00:05:58.133 --> 00:06:01.467
Now. I may be the face of this
operation. but you did that.

186
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.767
I know it.

187
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.633
You single handedly
transformed this show

188
00:06:04.767 --> 00:06:07.934
into something will
real integrity.

189
00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:10.100
And I know you sacrificed
a lot to do it.

190
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.800
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

191
00:06:13.934 --> 00:06:14.700
- Good.

192
00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:16.200
I'm hoping if I
butter you up enough

193
00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:17.900
you'll get me that local Emmy.

194
00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:18.834
Those gingerbread house stories.

195
00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:21.233
more juicy. hard
hitting news. right?

196
00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:23.967
- Now that ratings are up.
we're on the same page.

197
00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:27.233
- Now get out of here and
have some fun. will you?

198
00:06:27.367 --> 00:06:28.934
(lighthearted music)

199
00:06:29.066 --> 00:06:30.300
- Merry Christmas.

200
00:06:30.433 --> 00:06:31.800
- [River] Merry Christmas.

201
00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:36.166
(lighthearted music)

202
00:06:47.233 --> 00:06:48.000
- Hello?

203
00:06:49.433 --> 00:06:50.200
Is anyone home?

204
00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:51.934
Merry Christmas!

205
00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:53.800
- Uncle Tommy. Uncle
Tommy. Uncle Tommy!

206
00:06:53.934 --> 00:06:54.900
(laughing)

207
00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:56.567
- Ah. Merry Christmas!

208
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.900
You girls excited for Santa?

209
00:06:58.033 --> 00:06:58.700
- Mhm.

210
00:06:58.834 --> 00:06:59.700
- Yeah?
- Mhm.

211
00:06:59.834 --> 00:07:00.967
- Yeah. you know
Santa only comes

212
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.734
once you're fast
asleep though. right?

213
00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:03.000
- Okay. but come see what we put

214
00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:04.200
on our wishlist for Santa.

215
00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:07.200
- Girls. Uncle Tommy has
probably had a very long day.

216
00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:08.867
and that's a really long list.

217
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.934
- Nope. I can do it.

218
00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:11.166
- Yay!
- Yay!

219
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.967
(laughing)

220
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.000
- Okay.

221
00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:14.033
- Okay. here we go.

222
00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:16.433
(chuckling)

223
00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:17.667
- Okay.

224
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.367
(phone ringing)

225
00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:24.600
- Hey.

226
00:07:24.734 --> 00:07:26.300
- Hi. Kelly.

227
00:07:26.433 --> 00:07:27.600
Are you still coming?

228
00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:29.367
- Sorry. I just have
to finish editing this

229
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.667
and set the rundown for
the 26th. and then--

230
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.867
- Oh. yeah. yeah.

231
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.934
We get it.

232
00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:35.266
Do you have an ETA?

233
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.967
- I'll be there
as soon as I can.

234
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.867
- [Friend] Okay.

235
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.033
- Thanks. (chuckling)

236
00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:42.633
Me too.

237
00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:43.433
- You're right.

238
00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:45.200
She's not coming.

239
00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:48.066
(somber music)

240
00:07:56.066 --> 00:07:56.767
- Want a cookie?

241
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.800
I won't tell Santa.

242
00:07:57.934 --> 00:07:58.967
- Yes. two please.

243
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.934
It's been a long day.

244
00:08:01.066 --> 00:08:03.367
- Or a long yeah
by the look of it.

245
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.000
I'm not confident
you sleep anymore.

246
00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:07.533
- I'll sleep next year.

247
00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:09.200
- You should make that
your New Year's resolution.

248
00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:10.100
(chuckling)

249
00:08:10.233 --> 00:08:11.767
- I don't do resolutions.

250
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.066
Besides. that's kind of a
lame one. don't you think?

251
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.700
- I have two kids.

252
00:08:14.834 --> 00:08:16.834
Nothing about the promise
of sleep sounds lame to me.

253
00:08:16.967 --> 00:08:19.100
(chuckling)

254
00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:23.900
I really appreciate you
showing up here tonight.

255
00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:25.266
You're a really great uncle.

256
00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:28.433
- I'm an even better brother.

257
00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:30.233
- You are a life saver.

258
00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:33.367
Okay. so why don't
we start with those.

259
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.133
- Yep.

260
00:08:34.266 --> 00:08:35.233
- And then we'll be done soon.

261
00:08:35.367 --> 00:08:36.934
(knocking)

262
00:08:37.066 --> 00:08:38.233
- Merry Christmas!

263
00:08:41.233 --> 00:08:43.166
- Come on in.

264
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.133
(lighthearted Christmas music)

265
00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:52.834
- I can't believe I missed
Lisa and Jackson again.

266
00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:54.166
How upset were they?

267
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.333
- Well. you know. the
word straw. and camel.

268
00:08:57.467 --> 00:08:59.400
and back were thrown
around quite a bit.

269
00:08:59.533 --> 00:09:02.233
but not the word
break. more just like.

270
00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:04.767
"Ooh. that's a lot of straws
on that camel's back."

271
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.800
- Oh. I know I've
missed a lot lately but.

272
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.734
missing our Christmas
Eve. it just feels--

273
00:09:12.867 --> 00:09:13.600
- Yeah.

274
00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:14.767
It kinda stung.

275
00:09:15.633 --> 00:09:16.433
- Yeah.

276
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.800
- Look. we know you
love us in your own

277
00:09:18.934 --> 00:09:20.800
fierce. stubborn. Kelly way.

278
00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:23.233
And we all learned
pretty early on

279
00:09:23.367 --> 00:09:25.333
that Kelly's gonna do
what Kelly's gonna do.

280
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.667
And if you say no.

281
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.500
there is not an earthquake
powerful enough to move you.

282
00:09:29.633 --> 00:09:31.633
(laughing)

283
00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:33.500
- Am I really that stubborn?

284
00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:34.734
- No.

285
00:09:34.867 --> 00:09:36.567
(chuckles)

286
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.800
Look.

287
00:09:37.934 --> 00:09:39.500
The power of your "no"
has kept our group

288
00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:41.734
from making some pretty
catastrophic decisions

289
00:09:41.867 --> 00:09:42.667
over the years.

290
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.400
I mean. you single
handedly saved Lisa

291
00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:46.500
from that asymmetrical bob.

292
00:09:46.633 --> 00:09:50.000
and I think we both know what
saved your show this year.

293
00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:52.600
We get that had to be
your first priority.

294
00:09:52.734 --> 00:09:54.300
- Yeah. but I should've
been able to do all of that

295
00:09:54.433 --> 00:09:58.934
without making you all feel
like number two. or seven.

296
00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:00.400
or 100.

297
00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:02.834
(laughing)

298
00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:08.300
So. how do I fix this?

299
00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:10.633
- Well. you'll have
to show up more often.

300
00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:15.367
And slowly. one event at a
time. things will get better.

301
00:10:17.734 --> 00:10:19.567
And hey. New Year's
Eve is a week away.

302
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.700
Fresh start.

303
00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:23.400
- Yeah.

304
00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:25.333
- You are coming to
New Year's. right?

305
00:10:26.934 --> 00:10:28.400
- I don't know.

306
00:10:28.533 --> 00:10:31.633
It's late. loud music. and I
wouldn't miss it for the world.

307
00:10:31.767 --> 00:10:33.233
- Good.

308
00:10:33.367 --> 00:10:34.667
'Cause it might help to
apologize to them in person.

309
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.900
Like. really bring your A game.

310
00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:38.767
(laughing)

311
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.100
- Of course.

312
00:10:40.233 --> 00:10:42.467
Just. I'm gonna tell them...

313
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.600
You're the most important
people in the world to me.

314
00:10:44.734 --> 00:10:46.734
And I know those are
just words right now.

315
00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:47.934
but it's the new year.

316
00:10:48.066 --> 00:10:50.633
and I promise that
I am going to strive

317
00:10:50.767 --> 00:10:52.066
to be a much better friend.

318
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.300
- Good.

319
00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:56.667
Because we have been taking
applications to replace you.

320
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.667
- Some strong contenders.

321
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.667
And one of them
has a lake house.

322
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.467
(laughs)

323
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.567
- Ow. ow.

324
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.500
(laughing)

325
00:11:04.633 --> 00:11:07.400
- Thank you. for apologizing.

326
00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:08.734
It means a lot.

327
00:11:08.867 --> 00:11:09.800
- And you're right.
it's a new year.

328
00:11:09.934 --> 00:11:12.367
we all get a fresh start.

329
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.734
- [Patrick] You
can't be serious.

330
00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:15.867
- I don't know what else to say.

331
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.467
I don't believe in resolutions.

332
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.633
I find them restrictive.

333
00:11:19.767 --> 00:11:21.834
- It doesn't hurt to have
just a little direction.

334
00:11:21.967 --> 00:11:24.333
- You say direction.
I say blinders.

335
00:11:24.467 --> 00:11:26.066
I like to be open
to possibilities.

336
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:26.867
(laughing)

337
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.066
I do!

338
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.734
I'd rather be
flexible and say yes

339
00:11:29.867 --> 00:11:30.834
to whatever life throws at me.

340
00:11:30.967 --> 00:11:34.734
- That sounds a little passive.

341
00:11:34.867 --> 00:11:35.900
Yeah.

342
00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:36.700
It's like you're letting
life make all the choices

343
00:11:36.834 --> 00:11:38.333
instead of you.

344
00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:40.166
- Okay. well. also. you
know that most resolutions

345
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.000
statistically end in failures.

346
00:11:42.133 --> 00:11:43.700
I'm not trying to
start my new year

347
00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:45.133
already feeling like I'm behind.

348
00:11:45.266 --> 00:11:45.900
- Oh.

349
00:11:46.033 --> 00:11:47.233
No. no. no.

350
00:11:47.367 --> 00:11:48.867
See. our work schedule's
gonna take care of that.

351
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.367
(laughing)

352
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.400
- So. it's the New
Year's resolution.

353
00:11:52.533 --> 00:11:54.700
what are you guys thinking?

354
00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:56.233
- I'm going to cut back to

355
00:11:56.367 --> 00:11:57.734
one cup of coffee a day.

356
00:11:57.867 --> 00:11:59.567
- Uh. I'm sorry.
how is less coffee

357
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.934
gonna make the year better?

358
00:12:01.066 --> 00:12:03.066
- I'm gonna finally
finish my novel.

359
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.567
- That mystery series
you were working on?

360
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.033
- It's actually a young
adult thriller now.

361
00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:10.200
I switched it up
a few months ago.

362
00:12:10.333 --> 00:12:11.834
- Oh. great.

363
00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:14.767
What about you?

364
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.266
- I'm gonna do my new spin
class three days a week.

365
00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:20.400
What about you?

366
00:12:20.533 --> 00:12:22.867
- You know. I was
thinking I was gonna go

367
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.800
with my usual of--

368
00:12:24.934 --> 00:12:27.700
- 52 books in 52 weeks?
- 52 books in 52 weeks?

369
00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:28.967
- Yeah.

370
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.133
But...

371
00:12:32.266 --> 00:12:36.633
I realized. I said no
to a lot last year.

372
00:12:36.767 --> 00:12:38.800
and while that's
nothing new for me.

373
00:12:38.934 --> 00:12:42.533
every time I said no. it
felt like I was saying no

374
00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:44.900
to these small moments.

375
00:12:45.033 --> 00:12:47.633
But I realized
that the big stuff

376
00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:50.066
is made up of all
these small moments.

377
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.934
and I'm missing them.

378
00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:55.734
And I miss you guys.

379
00:12:55.867 --> 00:12:59.033
- Well. good news.
there's a pretty easy

380
00:12:59.166 --> 00:13:01.500
one word solution for that.

381
00:13:01.633 --> 00:13:02.934
- You're right.

382
00:13:03.066 --> 00:13:05.500
I'm gonna say no
to no this year.

383
00:13:05.633 --> 00:13:08.433
- This girl loves
the word no so much

384
00:13:08.567 --> 00:13:10.967
that she'd rather
say a double negative

385
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.834
than just say yes.

386
00:13:12.967 --> 00:13:14.667
- I'm serious. that's
gonna be my resolution.

387
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.300
I am saying yes.

388
00:13:17.433 --> 00:13:19.467
- Like. to going out dancing

389
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.500
after the ball drops tonight?

390
00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:22.600
- Yes.

391
00:13:22.734 --> 00:13:24.700
- And maybe for karaoke after?

392
00:13:24.834 --> 00:13:25.800
- Yes.

393
00:13:25.934 --> 00:13:26.967
- And you'll do the New
Year's Plunge with me

394
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:27.900
tomorrow morning?

395
00:13:29.233 --> 00:13:29.867
- No.

396
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:30.934
(laughing)

397
00:13:31.066 --> 00:13:31.900
Absolutely not.

398
00:13:32.033 --> 00:13:33.800
- No one actually
uses their resolution

399
00:13:33.934 --> 00:13:35.934
for serious soul
searching. you know?

400
00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:37.133
They usually fall
into one of a couple

401
00:13:37.266 --> 00:13:38.333
predictable categories.

402
00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:39.867
- Okay. fine.

403
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.533
What's my resolution?

404
00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:43.033
- Probably to get more than
seven hours a sleep a night.

405
00:13:43.166 --> 00:13:43.834
(laughing)

406
00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:45.600
- That's...

407
00:13:45.734 --> 00:13:46.867
Okay. yeah. no. you're right.

408
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:47.800
but you've known
me since college.

409
00:13:47.934 --> 00:13:48.867
- It doesn't matter.
I'm in marketing.

410
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.700
It's literally my job
to be able to predict

411
00:13:50.834 --> 00:13:51.967
what people are going to do.

412
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.834
- You're good. but
you're not that good.

413
00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:54.767
So. prove it.

414
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.934
Try the table behind you.

415
00:13:56.066 --> 00:13:56.834
- Okay.

416
00:13:56.967 --> 00:13:57.867
It's gonna go down
like this. huh?

417
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.767
- I wish you guys were there.

418
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.934
it was a disaster.

419
00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:03.533
The teleprompter broke.
I was sweating. it was.

420
00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:04.700
oh. it was a nightmare.

421
00:14:04.834 --> 00:14:06.533
- I am so sorry to interrupt.

422
00:14:06.667 --> 00:14:08.867
My name is Tom. Happy New Year.

423
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.533
(laughs)

424
00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:11.700
My friend and I over here.

425
00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:12.600
we're having a
difference of opinion

426
00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:14.100
over New Year's resolutions.

427
00:14:15.133 --> 00:14:17.166
Could I try and guess
what your resolutions are?

428
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.734
- Oh. I love this game.

429
00:14:20.367 --> 00:14:21.467
- They love this game.

430
00:14:23.066 --> 00:14:23.867
Okay.

431
00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:27.367
Raise your hand if
your resolutions

432
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.867
have anything to do with
giving something up.

433
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.266
preferably food related.

434
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.767
- I'm cutting back to
one cup of coffee a day.

435
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.066
or is accepted.

436
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.767
- That's specific.
and actionable.

437
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.000
- Still counts.

438
00:14:38.133 --> 00:14:39.433
For the record. no
one's year is any better

439
00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:41.333
with less coffee in it.

440
00:14:41.467 --> 00:14:42.567
- True.
(laughing)

441
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.033
- Raise your hand if
your resolution is about

442
00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:45.333
going to the gym.

443
00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:46.567
- Ah.

444
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.734
- Raise your hand if
your resolution is about

445
00:14:47.867 --> 00:14:49.333
finishing a creative project.

446
00:14:49.467 --> 00:14:50.266
- Novel.

447
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.667
He's good.

448
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.800
- No.

449
00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.834
No. no. no. sorry. no.
don't encourage him. okay?

450
00:14:54.967 --> 00:14:56.066
I'm sorry for him.

451
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.867
- I'm so encouraged right now.

452
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.934
Excellent.

453
00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:00.100
(chuckling)

454
00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:01.266
So. that leaves you.

455
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.767
- You're never gonna guess it.

456
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.934
- Really?

457
00:15:06.066 --> 00:15:06.900
Okay.

458
00:15:07.033 --> 00:15:08.066
Meditating every day.

459
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.800
- I don't have time to meditate.

460
00:15:09.934 --> 00:15:10.900
- Getting organized.

461
00:15:11.033 --> 00:15:12.400
- I bet dessert I'm the
most organized person

462
00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:13.633
in this restaurant.

463
00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:15.400
- Finally kicking your
Candy Crush habit.

464
00:15:15.533 --> 00:15:16.967
- I've never crushed a candy.

465
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.266
- Taking up kickboxing?

466
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.633
- The only thing I
kick is bad habits.

467
00:15:20.767 --> 00:15:23.800
(whimsical music)

468
00:15:23.934 --> 00:15:24.967
- I cave. what is it?

469
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.300
- I'm going to say yes to every
social invitation I receive.

470
00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:31.100
- Oh!

471
00:15:31.233 --> 00:15:33.967
Now that is interesting.

472
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.600
- Okay. I may have picked
the most interesting

473
00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:36.767
person in the restaurant.

474
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.667
- Oh!
- Oh. wow.

475
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.934
- Zero offense. I'm sorry.

476
00:15:40.066 --> 00:15:42.433
I meant to say. I think you're
the one brilliant exception

477
00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.633
to my New Year's
resolution rule.

478
00:15:44.767 --> 00:15:47.133
I'm so curious.
what inspired this?

479
00:15:47.266 --> 00:15:49.834
- I boxed myself in a
little too much last year.

480
00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:52.100
so I'm taking a chance on yes.

481
00:15:52.233 --> 00:15:53.734
- I love that. yeah. yes!

482
00:15:53.867 --> 00:15:55.767
Fall in love with
yes. no is the enemy.

483
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.000
- [Kelly] Hey!

484
00:15:57.133 --> 00:15:58.834
No has been a very
trusty friend of mine.

485
00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:00.166
- Why say no to something

486
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.500
when you could say
yes to something else?

487
00:16:01.633 --> 00:16:02.266
You're not saying
no to going out.

488
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.967
you're saying yes to staying in.

489
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.700
- Well. it's just a
positive spin on things.

490
00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:11.066
So. what's your resolution then?

491
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.500
- Don't believe in them.

492
00:16:12.633 --> 00:16:14.667
- They do. in fact. exist.

493
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.900
- I like to stay open
to possibilities.

494
00:16:17.033 --> 00:16:20.467
- Possibilities covers a
whole range of outcomes.

495
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.734
Some of which could be
a whole basket of yikes.

496
00:16:23.867 --> 00:16:26.200
- How long are you doing
this resolution for?

497
00:16:27.266 --> 00:16:30.433
- Maybe I'll do it until my
birthday on February 8th.

498
00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.667
- A lot can happen in a month.

499
00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:37.000
- Yeah.

500
00:16:37.133 --> 00:16:40.233
(lighthearted music)

501
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.066
- Hey. we're going to this
awesome New Year's party.

502
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.033
There's gonna be music. and
dancing. and the countdown.

503
00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:48.533
You want to come with us?

504
00:16:48.667 --> 00:16:50.800
- That sounds really
fun. but I can't.

505
00:16:50.934 --> 00:16:52.033
- You're really starting
this resolution off

506
00:16:52.166 --> 00:16:53.300
on the wrong foot.

507
00:16:53.433 --> 00:16:56.900
- Hey. and I still have 32
minutes to say no to anything.

508
00:16:57.033 --> 00:16:59.533
Plus. I already said yes
to my friends tonight.

509
00:17:00.734 --> 00:17:02.600
- Well. I can't say no to that.

510
00:17:04.033 --> 00:17:06.367
Okay. good luck with
your resolution.

511
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.867
- Thank you.

512
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.033
And Happy New Year.

513
00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:10.467
- You too.

514
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:11.767
- Hey. Tom.

515
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.033
How do you want to get there?

516
00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:14.467
- [Tom] I'm thinking we walk.

517
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.400
- Just. one sec.

518
00:17:17.066 --> 00:17:18.300
(loud commotion)

519
00:17:18.433 --> 00:17:21.100
(humming)

520
00:17:21.233 --> 00:17:24.333
(lighthearted music)

521
00:17:34.066 --> 00:17:35.567
- Okay. everyone.
we are going to

522
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.100
write down our resolutions.

523
00:17:38.233 --> 00:17:40.266
Fold your paper like this.

524
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.967
and then we are going to--

525
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.200
- Watch our wishes
go up in flames?

526
00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:45.467
- No.

527
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.300
We are going to
set our intention.

528
00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.734
and then watch it
drift up into the sky.

529
00:17:49.867 --> 00:17:51.200
- Why are we doing this?

530
00:17:51.333 --> 00:17:53.066
- We're letting it
go. and sending it up

531
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.033
in the hopes that we
get back what we need

532
00:17:55.166 --> 00:17:56.133
to make it come true.

533
00:17:56.266 --> 00:17:58.467
(lighthearted music)

534
00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.400
- We missed you.

535
00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:01.967
- I'll see you inside?

536
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:02.867
- Yeah. man.

537
00:18:09.467 --> 00:18:10.567
- Okay. let's do this!

538
00:18:11.433 --> 00:18:12.533
10. nine...
- Nine.

539
00:18:16.467 --> 00:18:17.367
(phone ringing)

540
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.133
- Six. five--

541
00:18:19.266 --> 00:18:20.367
- Hey. where are my girls?

542
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.533
- They passed out at 11.

543
00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:24.133
Happy New Year though.

544
00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:25.100
- Happy New Year.

545
00:18:25.233 --> 00:18:26.800
- [All] Happy New Year!

546
00:18:26.934 --> 00:18:29.233
(cheering)

547
00:18:30.166 --> 00:18:31.333
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

548
00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:33.567
- Cheers. cheers. cheers.

549
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.967
(phone buzzing)

550
00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.166
(lighthearted music)

551
00:18:43.233 --> 00:18:45.133
- Kelly Ezekiel Leone.

552
00:18:45.266 --> 00:18:47.200
- Uh. not my middle name.

553
00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:49.934
- I would like to
officially invite you

554
00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:53.133
to do the New Year's
Plunge with me tomorrow.

555
00:18:53.266 --> 00:18:54.367
- Oh. you've gotta
be kidding me.

556
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.834
(laughing)

557
00:18:55.967 --> 00:18:56.633
- [Lisa] I'm not.

558
00:18:56.767 --> 00:18:59.033
(laughing)

559
00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:02.900
- [AJ] Yeah. good one.

560
00:19:03.033 --> 00:19:06.600
(lighthearted music)

561
00:19:09.266 --> 00:19:11.700
- [Man] Happy New
Year. plungers!

562
00:19:11.834 --> 00:19:14.133
Welcome to the
Milwaukee Polar Plunge.

563
00:19:14.266 --> 00:19:16.900
presented by Imperium
National Bank.

564
00:19:17.033 --> 00:19:18.834
Make sure you register
if you want to plunge.

565
00:19:18.967 --> 00:19:23.934
- I can be convinced to have
the camera focused on not you.

566
00:19:24.867 --> 00:19:27.066
if maybe a certain
story about the biggest

567
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.166
snowman in the world
can get an approval.

568
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.467
- Nice try.

569
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.066
- Eh. worth a shot.

570
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.266
Well. have fun with your plunge.

571
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.867
I've got the marketing guy
from the bank sponsorship

572
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.867
ready for an interview.

573
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:38.867
- Oh. wow.

574
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.300
Really?

575
00:19:40.433 --> 00:19:42.033
Actually. since I'm here.

576
00:19:42.166 --> 00:19:44.667
do you mind if I go
prep him real quick?

577
00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.834
- You're the boss.

578
00:19:45.967 --> 00:19:46.900
- Hey.

579
00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:47.900
- Happy New Year.

580
00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:49.233
- Happy New Year.

581
00:19:49.367 --> 00:19:50.467
- New Year's Plunge?

582
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.333
That's your first
yes to the New Year?

583
00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:53.800
- However did you guess?

584
00:19:53.934 --> 00:19:55.367
- Because no sane
person would decide

585
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.133
to dive into a
freezing cold lake.

586
00:19:57.266 --> 00:19:59.367
- Says the guy who's
sponsoring the event.

587
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.633
- Oh. okay.

588
00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:02.300
You did a little
research on me. huh?

589
00:20:02.433 --> 00:20:05.000
- Actually. that is official
Wake Up Milwaukee business.

590
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.066
I'm the producer.

591
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.567
- Oh. you just came over
here to talk logistics.

592
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.033
- Just a little interview prep.

593
00:20:12.166 --> 00:20:12.834
- Okay. all right.

594
00:20:12.967 --> 00:20:14.367
So I'm not gonna find any other

595
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.567
fun little surprises
in my coat pockets?

596
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.867
- Up until last night. I had
given my phone number out

597
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.066
to approximately no one.

598
00:20:23.033 --> 00:20:25.867
So I guess the words
I'm searching for are...

599
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.667
Your move.

600
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.166
- See. I've been
thinking about it.

601
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.133
I can't ask you out.

602
00:20:31.266 --> 00:20:32.734
- Oh. but see. you can.

603
00:20:32.867 --> 00:20:35.200
This is a rejection free
zone. of fear free dating.

604
00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:36.433
- That's the thing though.

605
00:20:36.567 --> 00:20:38.567
I don't want you to say yes
because of some resolution.

606
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.300
I want a real yes.

607
00:20:40.433 --> 00:20:41.367
So I'm not gonna ask you out

608
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.300
until no is back on the table.

609
00:20:43.433 --> 00:20:46.066
- So.
you
Mr.
Open-To-The-Possibilities-Live-I

610
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.166
is gonna let an
entire month go by?

611
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.066
- There's a pretty
simple alternative.

612
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.834
- Which is?

613
00:20:51.967 --> 00:20:53.567
- You could always ask me out.

614
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.734
- Oh. oh. oh. oh.

615
00:20:55.867 --> 00:20:57.834
See. that's. it's different.

616
00:20:57.967 --> 00:20:58.867
- I mean. it's
the 21st century--

617
00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.834
- It makes it way dicey.

618
00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:00.533
- I didn't really take you as--

619
00:21:00.667 --> 00:21:01.467
- We ready?

620
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.066
The plunge is gonna start soon.

621
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:03.867
- Actually. if you could
just give us one more second.

622
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.633
we're trying to sort--

623
00:21:04.767 --> 00:21:06.367
- Actually. yup. great.

624
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.467
You guys have a great interview.

625
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.800
and I'm gonna go jump in
a subzero lake for fun.

626
00:21:10.934 --> 00:21:14.333
Happy New Year. this
has been real. okay.

627
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.967
(lighthearted music)

628
00:21:19.767 --> 00:21:20.433
(chuckling)

629
00:21:20.567 --> 00:21:22.266
- I know it seems crazy.

630
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.467
but I think it's gonna be great.

631
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.300
- Some are born great.
some achieve greatness.

632
00:21:30.233 --> 00:21:32.166
and some have greatness
thrust upon them.

633
00:21:34.266 --> 00:21:35.300
Shakespeare?

634
00:21:36.934 --> 00:21:38.100
Oh. it is cold.

635
00:21:38.233 --> 00:21:40.233
- [Man] On your marks...

636
00:21:42.233 --> 00:21:43.467
- I thought we were
committing to bathing suits.

637
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.400
- Oh. yeah.

638
00:21:45.533 --> 00:21:46.400
Yeah.

639
00:21:46.533 --> 00:21:47.800
- This was your idea!

640
00:21:47.934 --> 00:21:49.400
- [Man] Get set. go!

641
00:21:49.533 --> 00:21:50.734
- Mistakes.

642
00:21:50.867 --> 00:21:53.900
(lighthearted music)

643
00:21:58.867 --> 00:22:01.300
(screaming)

644
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.133
- Here. have some hot chocolate.

645
00:22:18.266 --> 00:22:19.100
- Thank you.

646
00:22:19.233 --> 00:22:21.367
I am so proud of you.

647
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.300
- Miss!

648
00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:24.467
Miss. miss.

649
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.467
Tell us. how does it feel
to know that your year

650
00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.867
can only get better from here?

651
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.467
- Ha. ha. ha. ha.

652
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.333
How'd the interview go?

653
00:22:30.467 --> 00:22:31.367
- Great.

654
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.333
Yeah. he was awesome.

655
00:22:32.467 --> 00:22:33.633
- Where did Tom go?

656
00:22:33.767 --> 00:22:36.000
- Oh. he had to run. but
he told me to tell you

657
00:22:36.133 --> 00:22:37.000
that you have his number

658
00:22:37.133 --> 00:22:39.200
just in case you
need a followup.

659
00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:40.200
- Okay.

660
00:22:40.333 --> 00:22:41.000
Thanks. Casey.

661
00:22:41.133 --> 00:22:41.967
- [Casey] Anytime.

662
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.066
- Let's go get warm.

663
00:22:44.433 --> 00:22:45.200
(laughing)

664
00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:46.433
- [Woman] Replay
it one more time.

665
00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:48.834
(laughing)

666
00:22:54.266 --> 00:22:55.133
- This is...

667
00:22:55.266 --> 00:22:56.300
- What were you thinking?

668
00:22:56.433 --> 00:22:58.266
- New Year's resolution.

669
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.533
- Again. what in the
world were you thinking?

670
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.567
- My resolution is to say yes

671
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.266
to every invitation I
receive for a month.

672
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.066
- Why?

673
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.367
That sounds awful.

674
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.033
- Well. I'm turning
30 next month.

675
00:23:11.166 --> 00:23:15.100
and I realized I shut off
aspects of my personal life.

676
00:23:15.233 --> 00:23:17.033
So. I am staying open.

677
00:23:17.166 --> 00:23:19.000
I'm spending time with friends.

678
00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:20.734
getting outside my comfort zone.

679
00:23:20.867 --> 00:23:22.266
- It's a great story.

680
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.700
- A great story.

681
00:23:26.166 --> 00:23:27.266
- Oh. no.

682
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.500
No. no. no. no. no.

683
00:23:28.633 --> 00:23:30.100
I'm a behind the
camera kind of person.

684
00:23:30.233 --> 00:23:32.066
- We could send her
to games. concerts.

685
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.600
that Blizzard 5K.

686
00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:34.900
- The art exhibit. the circus.

687
00:23:35.033 --> 00:23:36.333
Wait. isn't she
afraid of clowns?

688
00:23:36.467 --> 00:23:37.533
- Perfect.

689
00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:38.333
- No. no.

690
00:23:38.467 --> 00:23:39.500
Clowns are fine.

691
00:23:39.633 --> 00:23:40.633
Magicians on the other hand...

692
00:23:40.767 --> 00:23:42.500
I mean. don't you have
better candidates than me?

693
00:23:42.633 --> 00:23:44.734
- Listen. it would
be great for ratings.

694
00:23:44.867 --> 00:23:47.567
showing vulnerability from
one of our own. right?

695
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:48.600
Come on.

696
00:23:48.734 --> 00:23:51.400
Anything for the best story.

697
00:23:51.533 --> 00:23:54.100
(lighthearted music)

698
00:23:54.233 --> 00:23:56.166
- Anything for the show.

699
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.166
- [Casey] Yes!

700
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.367
(laughing)

701
00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.734
- I have the perfect
first segment.

702
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.100
- Maybe you can set the
camera up over there?

703
00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:04.066
Thanks.

704
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.200
Why can't somebody invite me

705
00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:08.467
to lay in front of a fire
on a big rug and read?

706
00:24:09.533 --> 00:24:11.467
- Okay. I've got everything
except for your phone.

707
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.367
and we'll meet you
at the finish line.

708
00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:16.300
How you feelin'?

709
00:24:16.433 --> 00:24:18.567
- I'm feeling like
I'm only gonna shoot

710
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.066
River's bad side for a week.

711
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:20.834
(laughing)

712
00:24:20.967 --> 00:24:22.500
- It's not all that bad.

713
00:24:22.633 --> 00:24:23.567
I saw the Imperium National
Bank signs floating around.

714
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.734
Maybe your cute bank
guy. Tom. will be here.

715
00:24:26.867 --> 00:24:27.600
- Shh.
- Was that his name?

716
00:24:27.734 --> 00:24:28.333
It was Tom--
- AJ.

717
00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:29.333
- Was that his name?

718
00:24:29.467 --> 00:24:30.400
Tom?
- Shh. shh. shh!

719
00:24:30.533 --> 00:24:32.266
- Just ask him out already.

720
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.600
Take a chance.

721
00:24:33.734 --> 00:24:35.433
- It's not a chance.

722
00:24:35.567 --> 00:24:36.700
I know it will happen.

723
00:24:38.233 --> 00:24:40.100
Well. cute banter for the
first couple of weeks.

724
00:24:40.233 --> 00:24:41.900
we'll fall for each other.

725
00:24:42.033 --> 00:24:44.233
I'll flake on him one
too many times for work.

726
00:24:44.367 --> 00:24:46.567
and then he'll break
up with me over dinner

727
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.934
at a candlelit restaurant.

728
00:24:48.066 --> 00:24:49.133
- Um. cool.

729
00:24:49.266 --> 00:24:50.367
Kel.

730
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.834
- Or. I'll break up with him
with some big. noble speech

731
00:24:51.967 --> 00:24:54.433
about bad timing.
and either way.

732
00:24:54.567 --> 00:24:55.467
it won't work out.
and I'll end up

733
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.500
scraping the cream off
of Oreos by myself.

734
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.400
- Hey.

735
00:25:02.533 --> 00:25:03.567
- Hey!

736
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:05.200
- Either I'm interrupting
something very serious.

737
00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:07.166
or that was perhaps
the most depressing

738
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.400
romantic comedy pitch ever.

739
00:25:08.533 --> 00:25:09.400
- Actually. we were
just discussing

740
00:25:09.533 --> 00:25:11.233
self fulfilling prophecies.

741
00:25:11.367 --> 00:25:12.166
Isn't that right?

742
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.400
- Yeah. that's right. mhm.

743
00:25:14.467 --> 00:25:16.467
- Well. anyways. I'll let
you guys get to the race.

744
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.300
Good luck. see you
at the finish line.

745
00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:19.066
- Mhm.

746
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.867
- [Tom] See ya.

747
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.233
- So. you're actually
running this thing.

748
00:25:23.367 --> 00:25:24.533
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah.

749
00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:25.834
Our bank thought it
would be good to have

750
00:25:25.967 --> 00:25:28.033
someone from our team
out here. on the course.

751
00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:29.300
Here I am.

752
00:25:29.433 --> 00:25:30.066
Yeah. what's the worst
that could happen?

753
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.900
I get a little sore tomorrow?

754
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.834
- No. the worst that can
happen is that camera

755
00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:35.633
captures the face
plant of a lifetime.

756
00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:38.333
and you become an overnight
internet cautionary tale.

757
00:25:39.433 --> 00:25:40.233
- You're a bit of a pessimist.

758
00:25:40.367 --> 00:25:42.233
- I'm a realist.

759
00:25:42.367 --> 00:25:44.734
And if I had known.
I could've prepared.

760
00:25:44.867 --> 00:25:47.967
and changed around my
whole workout routine.

761
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:48.734
(chuckles)

762
00:25:48.867 --> 00:25:50.333
- So. the winner of this race

763
00:25:50.467 --> 00:25:52.200
gets a $50 gift certificate
to Hoagie Heaven.

764
00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:54.200
I don't think it's that serious.

765
00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:56.333
- Hey. it's no fun
if it's not serious.

766
00:25:56.467 --> 00:25:57.667
- [Woman] Runners 27 and 34
to the start line. please.

767
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.900
- Plus. if I'm
gonna do something.

768
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.533
I'm gonna do it well.

769
00:26:01.667 --> 00:26:05.233
(lighthearted music)

770
00:26:05.367 --> 00:26:06.133
- Hm.

771
00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:10.900
How bout this...

772
00:26:11.033 --> 00:26:14.133
How about we just
race. the two of us.

773
00:26:14.266 --> 00:26:16.700
And then. after I win.
you buy us coffee.

774
00:26:16.834 --> 00:26:18.600
- After you win.
I bet you coffee?

775
00:26:18.734 --> 00:26:19.500
- That's right.

776
00:26:20.533 --> 00:26:24.266
- I think that sounds a
bit like a coffee date.

777
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.533
Did you ask me on a coffee date?

778
00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:28.300
- Nope. just a bet.
that may happen to segue

779
00:26:28.433 --> 00:26:30.200
into some friendly conversation.

780
00:26:30.333 --> 00:26:32.667
- [Woman] Runners
on your mark...

781
00:26:33.667 --> 00:26:35.734
- Okay.

782
00:26:35.867 --> 00:26:36.533
Game on.

783
00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:37.300
- [Woman] Get set...

784
00:26:37.433 --> 00:26:38.900
- All right.

785
00:26:39.033 --> 00:26:40.233
- And go!

786
00:26:40.367 --> 00:26:41.033
Hey!
(laughing)

787
00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:41.934
- No fair.

788
00:26:43.233 --> 00:26:44.233
(chuckling)

789
00:26:44.367 --> 00:26:45.433
(lighthearted music)

790
00:26:45.567 --> 00:26:46.233
You need a hand?

791
00:26:46.367 --> 00:26:47.734
- Nope.

792
00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:49.233
- That was an invitation.
you can't say no.

793
00:26:49.367 --> 00:26:50.133
- It's a trap.

794
00:26:52.266 --> 00:26:54.333
(laughing)

795
00:26:55.767 --> 00:26:58.734
- I'm gonna want a
medium latte. extra whip.

796
00:26:58.867 --> 00:27:00.266
My coffee order.

797
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.400
- That's your order?

798
00:27:02.133 --> 00:27:04.333
- So judgmental. what's yours?

799
00:27:04.467 --> 00:27:05.233
- Redeye.

800
00:27:06.266 --> 00:27:07.367
- Oh. of course it is.

801
00:27:08.633 --> 00:27:10.600
(chuckling)

802
00:27:10.734 --> 00:27:11.500
Oh!

803
00:27:11.633 --> 00:27:13.000
Takes the lead!

804
00:27:13.133 --> 00:27:15.100
- Race isn't over yet!

805
00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:16.533
- I don't know.

806
00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:19.767
(laughs)

807
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.166
You're pretty good at this.

808
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.066
(laughing)

809
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.433
- Okay. so. even though I
wasn't prepared for this.

810
00:27:39.567 --> 00:27:42.367
it was actually really fun.

811
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.967
This is Kelly Leone
with Wake Up Milwaukee.

812
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.300
Thanks.

813
00:27:47.433 --> 00:27:48.300
- For sure. thank you.

814
00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:49.100
(laughing)

815
00:27:49.233 --> 00:27:50.000
- You crushed it.

816
00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:51.266
- We are so proud of you!

817
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.533
- Let's go celebrate. yeah?

818
00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:53.633
Get you all the carbs.

819
00:27:53.767 --> 00:27:55.000
- Yeah. thanks. I...

820
00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:56.800
- Yeah. no. that's great.

821
00:27:56.934 --> 00:27:59.000
Thank you. my friend.

822
00:27:59.133 --> 00:27:59.900
- Come on.

823
00:28:03.233 --> 00:28:06.333
(lighthear)

824
00:28:11.233 --> 00:28:12.333
- What's this?

825
00:28:12.467 --> 00:28:14.433
- Oh. some guy dropped
those off for you.

826
00:28:14.567 --> 00:28:15.934
He left a note.

827
00:28:16.066 --> 00:28:19.166
(lighthearted music)

828
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.433
- Hello!

829
00:28:29.567 --> 00:28:30.800
- Lisa. what are you doing here?

830
00:28:30.934 --> 00:28:32.433
- Oh. I'm just on
my way to work.

831
00:28:32.567 --> 00:28:36.100
and thought I'd enjoy my one
cup of coffee a day with you.

832
00:28:36.233 --> 00:28:37.500
- Oh.

833
00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:39.934
You can never have
too much coffee.

834
00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:43.700
- Plus. I have a little
invite to extend your way.

835
00:28:44.633 --> 00:28:46.367
- Which is?

836
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.433
- I would like to
formally invite you.

837
00:28:48.567 --> 00:28:50.834
Miss Kelly Emmanuele Leone--

838
00:28:50.967 --> 00:28:52.033
- Not my middle name.

839
00:28:52.166 --> 00:28:54.400
- To a speed dating
event with me.

840
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.667
- And I can't say no.

841
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.667
- Come on!

842
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.934
Consider it a favor to me.

843
00:29:02.066 --> 00:29:03.066
You'll be there
for moral support.

844
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.233
and afterward I'll
buy you dinner?

845
00:29:07.333 --> 00:29:11.100
- Today is shaping up to be
a huge exercise in humility.

846
00:29:11.233 --> 00:29:12.200
- What do you mean?

847
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.934
- Welcome back. Milwaukee.

848
00:29:15.066 --> 00:29:18.500
As many of you know. our very
our producer. Kelly Leone.

849
00:29:18.633 --> 00:29:22.367
has made a resolution to
say yes to every invitation

850
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.000
that she receives.

851
00:29:24.133 --> 00:29:27.200
Kelly. talk to us about why
you made this resolution?

852
00:29:27.333 --> 00:29:29.066
- Well. I thought
it would be good

853
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.033
to step outside of my
comfort zone. River.

854
00:29:31.166 --> 00:29:33.834
- And boy. will she today.

855
00:29:33.967 --> 00:29:36.200
Kelly. what is
your greatest fear?

856
00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:38.100
- That'd be magicians. River.

857
00:29:38.233 --> 00:29:41.333
- Well. we are very excited
that Kelly has agreed

858
00:29:41.467 --> 00:29:46.133
to assist Milwaukee's
own Eric the Magnificent.

859
00:29:47.033 --> 00:29:50.266
(whimsical music)

860
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.834
(clapping)

861
00:29:52.967 --> 00:29:53.600
Go on. Kelly.

862
00:29:53.734 --> 00:29:56.066
(chuckling)

863
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.834
- Hey. man.

864
00:29:56.967 --> 00:29:57.900
I got your text about tonight.

865
00:29:58.033 --> 00:29:59.400
I will definitely be there.

866
00:29:59.533 --> 00:30:00.900
- [Patrick] Oh. I knew you
wouldn't leave me hanging.

867
00:30:01.033 --> 00:30:02.266
but that's not why I called.

868
00:30:03.633 --> 00:30:05.033
- [Tom] Hey. what's up?

869
00:30:05.166 --> 00:30:06.300
- I was going over our numbers
for the chili cook-off.

870
00:30:06.433 --> 00:30:08.200
and I really think we need to
tell Glenn to increase our--

871
00:30:08.333 --> 00:30:09.200
- No. no. no. no.

872
00:30:09.333 --> 00:30:10.367
We can fix this
without going to Glenn.

873
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.567
- Yeah. but we're understaffed.
and we're over budget.

874
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.367
- There will be a more
creative solution.

875
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.100
We're small in numbers. but
we're big on enthusiasm.

876
00:30:17.233 --> 00:30:19.200
- Yeah. well not
everyone. sorry.

877
00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:21.200
anyone matches your enthusiasm.

878
00:30:22.467 --> 00:30:23.567
And we're gonna need
more than just that

879
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.000
with this much on the line.

880
00:30:25.133 --> 00:30:26.166
- I don't know about that.

881
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.533
People can really surprise
you if given the chance.

882
00:30:30.033 --> 00:30:31.266
- [River] Ladies and gentlemen.

883
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.934
Kelly is now levitating.

884
00:30:34.066 --> 00:30:35.433
- [Patrick] All
right. all right.

885
00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:37.867
Take another look
when you come in.

886
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.700
- Yeah man. bye.

887
00:30:39.834 --> 00:30:40.834
- [River] Kelly Leone. everyone.

888
00:30:40.967 --> 00:30:45.200
Starting the new year off
with a touch of magic.

889
00:30:45.333 --> 00:30:48.400
(lighthearted music)

890
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.600
(heavy breathing)

891
00:30:51.734 --> 00:30:54.100
- Okay. that wasn't my thing.

892
00:30:54.233 --> 00:30:57.100
but it was awesome to
see you do your thing.

893
00:30:57.233 --> 00:30:59.100
Thoroughly entertaining.

894
00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:01.900
- Almost as entertaining
as watching someone. say.

895
00:31:02.033 --> 00:31:03.433
levitate on a table?

896
00:31:03.567 --> 00:31:04.333
- Oh. no. you saw that.

897
00:31:04.467 --> 00:31:05.633
- Oh. I recorded it.

898
00:31:05.767 --> 00:31:07.000
I will be printing a banner

899
00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:08.266
for your birthday
party next month.

900
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.567
- I'm not having a party.

901
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.133
- Ah. but see. I just
invited you to it. so...

902
00:31:12.266 --> 00:31:13.734
- Ah. I see.

903
00:31:13.867 --> 00:31:14.767
I see what you did there.

904
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.066
(chuckling)

905
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:16.967
Fine.

906
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:18.633
But please. no magicians.

907
00:31:18.767 --> 00:31:20.633
This resolution is
quickly turning into

908
00:31:20.767 --> 00:31:23.500
Live with Kelly and
her worst fears.

909
00:31:23.633 --> 00:31:25.800
- I don't think that's
such a bad thing.

910
00:31:25.934 --> 00:31:27.133
And you have been
playing it pretty safe

911
00:31:27.266 --> 00:31:28.333
these last few years because

912
00:31:28.467 --> 00:31:31.133
maybe you are just the
tiniest bit afraid of failure?

913
00:31:31.266 --> 00:31:32.900
- Well. who isn't?

914
00:31:33.033 --> 00:31:36.467
Being bad at something
feels exactly how it sounds.

915
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.266
- Okay.

916
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.934
Real talk?

917
00:31:39.066 --> 00:31:40.767
I have seen you turn down some
pretty exciting opportunities

918
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.467
because you weren't so
sure you could pull it off.

919
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.000
- Just that wisdom.

920
00:31:45.133 --> 00:31:47.100
having a firm enough
grip on your comfort zone

921
00:31:47.233 --> 00:31:49.133
to not plummet into failure.

922
00:31:49.266 --> 00:31:52.166
- Yeah. it's just. maybe
all that holding on so tight

923
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.500
might make you more sore

924
00:31:53.633 --> 00:31:55.500
than a quick brush with
the ground ever would.

925
00:31:55.633 --> 00:31:58.700
(lighthearted music)

926
00:32:04.667 --> 00:32:07.233
(catchy music)

927
00:32:07.367 --> 00:32:08.800
- You've gotta be kidding me.

928
00:32:08.934 --> 00:32:09.600
- Hm?

929
00:32:11.867 --> 00:32:12.667
- Oh...

930
00:32:13.934 --> 00:32:15.200
- What are you doing?

931
00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:16.800
- Avoiding Tom.

932
00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:18.166
- [Lisa] I can see that.

933
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.066
Why?

934
00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.533
- Because I'm here
to support you.

935
00:32:21.667 --> 00:32:23.133
What kind of friend
would I be if I--

936
00:32:23.266 --> 00:32:24.400
- Great!

937
00:32:24.533 --> 00:32:26.367
You hop on over there.
ask Tom out real quick.

938
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.133
and then you can
focus all your energy

939
00:32:28.266 --> 00:32:30.133
on helping me get a date.

940
00:32:30.266 --> 00:32:32.967
- [Kelly] How does
one even speed date?

941
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.300
- It is just like
producing. okay?

942
00:32:34.433 --> 00:32:36.567
You're gonna hear
a couple pitches.

943
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.633
and all you gotta
do is trust your gut

944
00:32:38.767 --> 00:32:40.633
and say yes or no.

945
00:32:40.767 --> 00:32:42.867
You'll be amazing. have fun.

946
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.667
(chuckling)

947
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.633
Bye.

948
00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:47.367
(lighthearted music)

949
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:48.133
(bell dings)

950
00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:49.667
- It was great talking to you.

951
00:32:53.934 --> 00:32:54.567
- Hi.

952
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:55.367
- Patrick.

953
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.567
(chuckling)

954
00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.133
So. you work for
Imperium National Bank?

955
00:32:59.266 --> 00:33:00.400
- Yep. with Tom.

956
00:33:00.533 --> 00:33:02.400
He's a great guy. that Tom.

957
00:33:02.533 --> 00:33:04.033
- Did you grow up in Wisconsin/

958
00:33:04.166 --> 00:33:05.867
- No. I moved here for college.

959
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.233
That's where I met Tom.

960
00:33:07.367 --> 00:33:09.300
Did you know that Tom is
actually the president

961
00:33:09.433 --> 00:33:10.233
of our student--

962
00:33:10.367 --> 00:33:13.200
- So. is this how
this is gonna go?

963
00:33:13.333 --> 00:33:15.800
- For the next two
minutes and 30 seconds?

964
00:33:15.934 --> 00:33:16.734
Yeah.

965
00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:19.400
So. back to Tom.

966
00:33:19.533 --> 00:33:21.400
- So. you've known
Kelly since childhood?

967
00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:23.066
- Yeah. listen.

968
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.433
I need you to know that if I
was vetting you for myself.

969
00:33:25.567 --> 00:33:28.300
these next few minutes
would be far less painful.

970
00:33:28.433 --> 00:33:29.967
(chuckling)

971
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.367
What's your biggest fear?

972
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.867
Abandonment. and
gas station sushi.

973
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.967
- Dinner with one
person. living or dead?

974
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.633
- My nana. or Aaron Rodgers.

975
00:33:38.767 --> 00:33:40.467
- Go Pack.

976
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.533
Sir.

977
00:33:41.667 --> 00:33:43.533
Please describe to me the ending

978
00:33:43.667 --> 00:33:45.500
of your last serious
relationship.

979
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.300
- Define serious.

980
00:33:48.433 --> 00:33:49.700
- Not a good answer. Tommy.

981
00:33:49.834 --> 00:33:51.033
- Hey!

982
00:33:51.166 --> 00:33:53.133
Only my sister Sheila
gets to call me Tommy.

983
00:33:53.266 --> 00:33:55.300
(lighthearted music)

984
00:33:55.433 --> 00:33:56.433
(bell dings)

985
00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.233
- Oh. well. lovely.

986
00:33:58.367 --> 00:34:01.500
(lighthearted music)

987
00:34:02.633 --> 00:34:04.633
- Hi there. Kelly.

988
00:34:04.767 --> 00:34:05.600
- Hey.

989
00:34:05.734 --> 00:34:06.633
- Fancy meeting you here.

990
00:34:07.734 --> 00:34:08.867
I'm gonna be honest with you.

991
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.333
my pride is a
little bit bruised.

992
00:34:10.467 --> 00:34:11.567
Here you are at a
speed dating event

993
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.500
when I so very delicately
placed the ball in your court.

994
00:34:14.633 --> 00:34:17.467
- In fairness. you're also here.

995
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.333
at a speed dating event.

996
00:34:18.467 --> 00:34:20.700
- I'm here for
moral support only.

997
00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:22.600
- Oh. so am I.

998
00:34:22.734 --> 00:34:24.333
By the way. Patrick.

999
00:34:24.467 --> 00:34:26.533
clearly a master of the pitch.

1000
00:34:26.667 --> 00:34:28.800
- Oh. good. so he
was convincing?

1001
00:34:28.934 --> 00:34:29.700
- Yes.

1002
00:34:32.133 --> 00:34:33.233
Yes.

1003
00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:35.633
- Oh. okay.

1004
00:34:35.767 --> 00:34:37.633
Spoiler alert. this
is a sure thing.

1005
00:34:37.767 --> 00:34:39.734
there is no world
in which I say no.

1006
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
- Do you want to
grab dinner sometime?

1007
00:34:45.133 --> 00:34:45.967
(bell dings)

1008
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:46.867
- Oh!

1009
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:48.834
That's my cue.

1010
00:34:48.967 --> 00:34:50.000
I should--

1011
00:34:50.133 --> 00:34:51.800
- Wait. wait. wait.

1012
00:34:51.934 --> 00:34:53.500
Sorry. could you go around?

1013
00:34:53.633 --> 00:34:54.400
- Sorry. Peter.

1014
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.667
How about Tuesday?

1015
00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.467
- I'm trying out curling.

1016
00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.266
- Wait. really?

1017
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.200
- Don't laugh.

1018
00:35:00.333 --> 00:35:01.400
Wednesday?

1019
00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:02.567
- Nope. sponsoring an event.

1020
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:03.834
How about Thursday?

1021
00:35:03.967 --> 00:35:05.767
- AJ invited me to go dancing.

1022
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:07.433
unless you want to...

1023
00:35:07.567 --> 00:35:09.600
- No. we have like
five more dates

1024
00:35:09.734 --> 00:35:12.000
until I introduce you
to my other left foot.

1025
00:35:12.133 --> 00:35:14.200
I'd say Friday. but--

1026
00:35:14.333 --> 00:35:15.266
- I can't either. I'm going to

1027
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.200
the hockey game with my friends.

1028
00:35:17.333 --> 00:35:18.667
- Wait. really?

1029
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.100
Me too.

1030
00:35:20.233 --> 00:35:21.734
It's for the bank.

1031
00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:25.033
Hey. we have a VIP box.

1032
00:35:25.166 --> 00:35:26.266
You're welcome to--

1033
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.867
- Oh. no. we couldn't possibly--

1034
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.767
- Yes. we could.

1035
00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.066
We'd love to.

1036
00:35:31.734 --> 00:35:33.100
- Okay.

1037
00:35:33.233 --> 00:35:34.033
It's a date.

1038
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.400
(chuckling)

1039
00:35:36.533 --> 00:35:37.266
(bell dings)

1040
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.200
See you Friday.

1041
00:35:38.333 --> 00:35:39.200
- See you Friday.

1042
00:35:39.333 --> 00:35:41.266
Bye.
- Tom.

1043
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.200
Mhm.

1044
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.300
arted music)

1045
00:35:47.433 --> 00:35:49.533
- [Announcer] Brings it
into the zone. drop pass.

1046
00:35:49.667 --> 00:35:50.400
is he gonna take the shot?

1047
00:35:50.533 --> 00:35:52.033
No!

1048
00:35:52.166 --> 00:35:54.066
Goes back to the net. and
he loses it behind the net.

1049
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.200
Coming back the other way.

1050
00:35:56.333 --> 00:35:57.100
- Oh.

1051
00:35:58.367 --> 00:35:59.834
Maybe you could
set up over there?

1052
00:36:00.767 --> 00:36:02.300
Can I confess something?

1053
00:36:02.433 --> 00:36:04.333
- Sure. of course.

1054
00:36:04.467 --> 00:36:07.033
- Um. I'm not
really a hockey fan.

1055
00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:09.433
- Oh...

1056
00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.700
Well. that is...

1057
00:36:11.834 --> 00:36:12.867
Me neither.

1058
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.867
- Seriously?

1059
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.500
- No.

1060
00:36:15.633 --> 00:36:17.533
Three brothers played. I
just never caught the bug.

1061
00:36:17.667 --> 00:36:18.533
- Three brothers?

1062
00:36:18.667 --> 00:36:19.834
- Mhm.

1063
00:36:19.967 --> 00:36:20.467
Three brothers.
and a big sister.

1064
00:36:22.433 --> 00:36:23.200
What about you?

1065
00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:24.500
- I'm an only child.

1066
00:36:25.467 --> 00:36:26.300
- Huh.

1067
00:36:26.433 --> 00:36:27.967
- What?

1068
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.200
- Definitely explains your
propensity for saying no.

1069
00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:30.800
In a house with
four other siblings.

1070
00:36:30.934 --> 00:36:32.500
you could scream no at
the top of your lungs.

1071
00:36:32.633 --> 00:36:33.800
you're still outvoted.

1072
00:36:33.934 --> 00:36:35.667
- So you had to go
along to get along?

1073
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.133
- Oh. absolutely.

1074
00:36:37.266 --> 00:36:39.033
You gotta make
alliances. and then.

1075
00:36:39.166 --> 00:36:40.367
well then you have
a partner to blame

1076
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.533
when they knock over
your grandma's lamp.

1077
00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:43.367
- Mhm.

1078
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.500
Yeah. there was no one
to point the finger at

1079
00:36:45.633 --> 00:36:46.600
in my house.

1080
00:36:46.734 --> 00:36:49.533
- See. I feel like only
child life is awesome.

1081
00:36:50.367 --> 00:36:52.500
You have absolute
control of the TV.

1082
00:36:52.633 --> 00:36:54.166
you never have to
share your toys.

1083
00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:55.600
- And no one to share
the pressure either.

1084
00:36:55.734 --> 00:36:58.266
It's life lived
under a microscope.

1085
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.233
(lighthearted music)

1086
00:37:00.367 --> 00:37:03.533
You know what the best
thing about stadiums is?

1087
00:37:03.667 --> 00:37:05.633
- The intoxicating
of groupthink.

1088
00:37:06.433 --> 00:37:09.734
- I was gonna go with
cheese fries. but...

1089
00:37:09.867 --> 00:37:12.100
- But there's a whole
table here of catered food.

1090
00:37:13.533 --> 00:37:14.533
You want to go get cheese fries?

1091
00:37:14.667 --> 00:37:16.166
- Yeah.

1092
00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.767
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1093
00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.734
- Thanks a bunch.

1094
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.834
- Mm.

1095
00:37:21.967 --> 00:37:24.200
- No. I actually don't
like cheese fries.

1096
00:37:24.333 --> 00:37:25.834
- I have so many questions.

1097
00:37:25.967 --> 00:37:27.333
(laughing)

1098
00:37:27.467 --> 00:37:29.500
Starting with why would somebody
agree to split something

1099
00:37:29.633 --> 00:37:31.667
that they knowingly dislike?

1100
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.266
- I just came for the company.

1101
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.867
I was being nice.

1102
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.400
- There's nice. and then
there's deferential.

1103
00:37:37.533 --> 00:37:39.033
(chuckling)

1104
00:37:39.166 --> 00:37:40.867
- Why do I feel like that's
the nice way of saying it?

1105
00:37:42.367 --> 00:37:43.400
- I'm just saying. you
don't have to worry about

1106
00:37:43.533 --> 00:37:45.266
sharing your opinions around me.

1107
00:37:46.734 --> 00:37:48.700
- I think fake cheese
isn't real food.

1108
00:37:48.834 --> 00:37:50.300
and I find it disgusting.

1109
00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.266
- Well. I think
you're wrong. but.

1110
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.367
I appreciate your honesty.

1111
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:03.533
So. Monday. I'm going to the
Chinese New Year's celebration.

1112
00:38:04.533 --> 00:38:07.567
There'll be music. and
some cool installations.

1113
00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.233
The show's sending me for
my resolution segment.

1114
00:38:11.367 --> 00:38:13.433
And. you know. maybe
I thought it could be

1115
00:38:13.567 --> 00:38:15.300
a good opportunity
for the bank--

1116
00:38:15.433 --> 00:38:17.066
- Are you asking me
out on a business date?

1117
00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:17.967
- No.

1118
00:38:19.633 --> 00:38:20.967
I'm asking you on a date.

1119
00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.567
and really trying
to sweeten the pot

1120
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.300
so you'll say yes.

1121
00:38:24.433 --> 00:38:24.934
- Yes.

1122
00:38:25.066 --> 00:38:26.333
I'm there. I can't wait.

1123
00:38:27.967 --> 00:38:28.767
- Great.

1124
00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.767
(lighthearted music)

1125
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.166
- Now. Kelly.

1126
00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.467
This week you were
invited to try curling

1127
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.767
for the first time.

1128
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.900
What were your more
surprising takeaways?

1129
00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:43.000
- This resolution
has really shown me

1130
00:38:43.133 --> 00:38:44.600
that my life can benefit

1131
00:38:44.734 --> 00:38:46.967
from having some
adventure thrown in.

1132
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.633
- Let's see how she did.

1133
00:38:48.767 --> 00:38:50.467
- Hi. Kelly Leone. and I'm here

1134
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.834
at Milwaukee's own
local curling club.

1135
00:38:52.967 --> 00:38:55.066
about to be swept off my feet.

1136
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.233
Here's where my adventure
took an interesting turn.

1137
00:38:58.367 --> 00:39:01.400
But in my defense. the
ice is very slippery.

1138
00:39:01.533 --> 00:39:03.333
I wasn't much for
throwing stones.

1139
00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:05.433
but they did say I had
a knack for sweeping.

1140
00:39:07.266 --> 00:39:09.166
- - [Man] And we're
in commercial. back
in three minutes.

1141
00:39:10.533 --> 00:39:11.533
- Can I talk to
you for a minute?

1142
00:39:11.667 --> 00:39:12.800
- Yeah. what's up?

1143
00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:14.400
- So. I've interviewed
at least 20 people

1144
00:39:14.533 --> 00:39:16.500
who say that accounts were
opened under their name

1145
00:39:16.633 --> 00:39:18.200
at Imperium National Bank

1146
00:39:18.333 --> 00:39:19.967
without their permission.

1147
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.967
- Is anyone willing
to go on the record?

1148
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.400
- Not yet.

1149
00:39:23.533 --> 00:39:24.500
But the more that
people come forward.

1150
00:39:24.633 --> 00:39:26.033
the more likely that they will.

1151
00:39:26.166 --> 00:39:27.066
- Keep digging.

1152
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.800
And if you can get some intel

1153
00:39:28.934 --> 00:39:31.800
from someone inside
Imperium. all the better.

1154
00:39:31.934 --> 00:39:33.300
- You got it.

1155
00:39:33.433 --> 00:39:36.300
- Now that seems like
hard hitting news.

1156
00:39:36.433 --> 00:39:38.467
Don't you know someone at
Imperium National Bank?

1157
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.400
Sorry. I misspoke.

1158
00:39:40.533 --> 00:39:43.066
Aren't you dating someone
at Imperium National Bank?

1159
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.133
- If we were gonna
go after Imperium.

1160
00:39:45.266 --> 00:39:46.667
our story would have
to be bulletproof.

1161
00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.100
Our integrity...

1162
00:39:49.066 --> 00:39:51.533
If I asked Tom to
get involved. I mean.

1163
00:39:51.667 --> 00:39:53.500
the fact that I'm
even dating Tom is--

1164
00:39:53.633 --> 00:39:54.400
- You know what?

1165
00:39:54.533 --> 00:39:55.400
Maybe you're right.

1166
00:39:55.533 --> 00:39:57.633
It's early in the story.
maybe it's nothing.

1167
00:39:57.767 --> 00:40:00.033
- No. 20 people isn't nothing.

1168
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.567
- Maybe just cross that
bridge when you come to it.

1169
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.367
Okay?

1170
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.166
(dramatic music)

1171
00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:12.500
- Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1172
00:40:12.633 --> 00:40:15.333
Everyone owes Lisa $100
for a wedding gift.

1173
00:40:15.467 --> 00:40:17.133
- Love the rules. pay up.

1174
00:40:17.266 --> 00:40:18.033
Mhm!

1175
00:40:18.967 --> 00:40:20.233
Yup. thank you.

1176
00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:23.967
- Oh!

1177
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.500
Got two sets of twins. but sure.

1178
00:40:25.633 --> 00:40:26.967
I'll go back to night school.

1179
00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.233
- For a game called "Life".

1180
00:40:28.367 --> 00:40:30.166
you're afforded
very few choices.

1181
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.700
It's a pretty bleak outlook.

1182
00:40:31.834 --> 00:40:34.467
- In all fairness. I did
offer you other options.

1183
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.333
- At what point does
a love of boardgames

1184
00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:38.233
tip into obsession?

1185
00:40:38.367 --> 00:40:39.967
(laughing)

1186
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.567
- Two. three. four. five.

1187
00:40:43.533 --> 00:40:45.033
Move to a new city.

1188
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.333
Okay. there was like a look.

1189
00:40:52.467 --> 00:40:53.066
- A look?

1190
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.033
No. no look.

1191
00:40:54.166 --> 00:40:54.867
Lisa. I think it's your spin.

1192
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.667
- Right.

1193
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.500
(clears throat)

1194
00:40:57.633 --> 00:40:58.734
- Okay. no. no. what's going on?

1195
00:40:58.867 --> 00:41:00.567
There's like a
look going on here.

1196
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.867
- It's just. like. a year ago

1197
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.266
you were applying for
jobs in another city.

1198
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.233
and you were so
excited about it.

1199
00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:10.367
- Yeah. but I was worried
about losing my job.

1200
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.467
I mean. who would
I be if I bailed

1201
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.567
when the going got tough?

1202
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.734
- That's right.

1203
00:41:14.867 --> 00:41:16.800
And when the going gets
tough. the tough get going.

1204
00:41:16.934 --> 00:41:17.800
- Exactly.

1205
00:41:17.934 --> 00:41:18.600
- To Chicago.

1206
00:41:18.734 --> 00:41:19.900
- No.

1207
00:41:20.033 --> 00:41:21.533
What. you spend one
year as a flaky friend

1208
00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:22.700
and all of a sudden
they're trying

1209
00:41:22.834 --> 00:41:24.433
to ship you out of the state?

1210
00:41:24.567 --> 00:41:26.400
- Don't be dramatic.
it's a two hour drive.

1211
00:41:26.533 --> 00:41:28.066
- 90 minutes by train.

1212
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.066
- And there's a Six Flags
like right in the middle.

1213
00:41:31.033 --> 00:41:32.300
- We did our research.

1214
00:41:33.533 --> 00:41:34.367
- Look. as long as
we've known you.

1215
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.800
your goal has been the same.

1216
00:41:35.934 --> 00:41:38.734
- [All] Emmy Award
winning news producer.

1217
00:41:38.867 --> 00:41:41.066
- But dreams change. okay?

1218
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.100
- You started producing
home movies. what.

1219
00:41:44.233 --> 00:41:45.567
when we were in middle school?

1220
00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.200
Made me wear that terrible wig.

1221
00:41:47.333 --> 00:41:49.000
and pretend to be Diane Sawyer.

1222
00:41:49.867 --> 00:41:51.400
You were born for this.

1223
00:41:51.533 --> 00:41:52.433
- Come on.

1224
00:41:52.567 --> 00:41:54.767
You spent a couple weeks
now living in the yes.

1225
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.767
doesn't that make the
unknown feel a little more...

1226
00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:01.433
- You're right. I have
done things this month

1227
00:42:01.567 --> 00:42:03.834
that I never would
have imagined I'd do.

1228
00:42:03.967 --> 00:42:06.667
- And you did it all without
falling on your face.

1229
00:42:07.967 --> 00:42:09.533
- All right. all right.

1230
00:42:09.667 --> 00:42:13.900
Truth is. a year ago. I
was terrified of failure.

1231
00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:19.633
But maybe now it's a good time
to be open to possibilities.

1232
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.967
(lighthearted music)

1233
00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.233
- And the response we're getting
for this New Year's segment

1234
00:42:32.367 --> 00:42:33.467
is through the roof.

1235
00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.800
You guys really knocked it
out of the park on this one.

1236
00:42:35.934 --> 00:42:37.667
- All the credit goes to Kelly.

1237
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.333
- It's a team
effort. and clearly.

1238
00:42:39.467 --> 00:42:40.500
I wouldn't have
done it without you.

1239
00:42:40.633 --> 00:42:42.700
- Now let's talk about this
story Casey's working on

1240
00:42:42.834 --> 00:42:44.734
about Imperium National
Bank. where do we stand?

1241
00:42:44.867 --> 00:42:46.567
- We've got 20 people
who've come forward

1242
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.667
stating that the
bank has opened up

1243
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.367
credit card and bank
accounts under their names

1244
00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.333
without their permission.

1245
00:42:51.467 --> 00:42:53.500
- We think it has to
do with incentives

1246
00:42:53.633 --> 00:42:54.633
for the sales team.

1247
00:42:54.767 --> 00:42:55.667
- Is anyone on the record?

1248
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.433
- Three.

1249
00:42:56.567 --> 00:42:58.000
But Casey is working on more.

1250
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.066
- This is intriguing.
but it's not there yet.

1251
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.467
- This is a great story.

1252
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.533
We've got people on
record stating that--

1253
00:43:04.667 --> 00:43:05.567
- Claiming that.

1254
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.367
It's difficult to prove.

1255
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.533
We need something concrete.

1256
00:43:08.667 --> 00:43:09.900
otherwise it's just their word

1257
00:43:10.033 --> 00:43:12.233
against the word
of a national bank.

1258
00:43:12.367 --> 00:43:13.233
- But if they're
telling the truth.

1259
00:43:13.367 --> 00:43:14.734
the proof is out there.

1260
00:43:14.867 --> 00:43:17.633
We'll need a whistleblower
on the inside.

1261
00:43:17.767 --> 00:43:20.233
Find either one of those
things. we'll run it.

1262
00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.900
(dramatic music)

1263
00:43:26.233 --> 00:43:27.100
- A whistleblower.

1264
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.667
- I can't ask him to do that.

1265
00:43:32.367 --> 00:43:33.834
- You must really like this guy.

1266
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.467
- Why would you say that?

1267
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.600
- Because a year ago. this
would've been a no brainer.

1268
00:43:41.233 --> 00:43:43.900
(dramatic music)

1269
00:43:54.934 --> 00:43:56.533
- Hey. do you have a second?

1270
00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:57.567
- Hey. yeah.

1271
00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:58.467
What's going on?

1272
00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.500
- I was just hoping
we could meet up.

1273
00:44:01.633 --> 00:44:03.133
- [Tom] No meat!

1274
00:44:03.266 --> 00:44:05.133
- Or we don't have to.

1275
00:44:05.266 --> 00:44:06.433
- No. no. I'm sorry.
I'm not talking to you.

1276
00:44:06.567 --> 00:44:07.633
Leo. that's the
vegetarian section.

1277
00:44:07.767 --> 00:44:09.033
I'm at the chili
cook-off right now.

1278
00:44:09.166 --> 00:44:10.600
you're welcome to
come if you want.

1279
00:44:10.734 --> 00:44:12.467
Like how I didn't make
that an invitation?

1280
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.433
- You sound pretty swamped.

1281
00:44:14.567 --> 00:44:15.867
- Hey. that's actually
the kid's section

1282
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.166
right over there.

1283
00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.166
Thanks.

1284
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:19.533
Please come. I'd
love to see you.

1285
00:44:19.667 --> 00:44:20.533
- Okay.

1286
00:44:20.667 --> 00:44:23.867
(lighthearted music)

1287
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:24.633
- [Patrick] Hey.

1288
00:44:24.767 --> 00:44:25.867
- Hey.

1289
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.467
- Okay. restaurants
are all set up.

1290
00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.800
but the registration for
amateur entrance is a mess.

1291
00:44:29.934 --> 00:44:31.433
The forms apparently
didn't print properly--

1292
00:44:31.567 --> 00:44:33.600
- No problem. I'm
on it. just stall.

1293
00:44:33.734 --> 00:44:34.767
- Stall. right.

1294
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.600
- Just stall.

1295
00:44:36.734 --> 00:44:37.567
Hey!

1296
00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.066
I'm so glad to see you.

1297
00:44:40.934 --> 00:44:41.600
- Oh.

1298
00:44:41.734 --> 00:44:42.700
(laughing)

1299
00:44:42.834 --> 00:44:44.166
How are you doing?

1300
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:45.100
This looks--

1301
00:44:45.233 --> 00:44:48.300
- Yeah. it's gonna be great.

1302
00:44:48.433 --> 00:44:49.333
It's just...

1303
00:44:49.467 --> 00:44:50.467
Hey guys. the extra bales of hay

1304
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.166
go out in the game tent.

1305
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.467
Thank you.

1306
00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.367
What did you want
to talk to me about?

1307
00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.600
- Oh. you know. we can--

1308
00:44:56.734 --> 00:44:58.000
- Tickets!

1309
00:44:58.133 --> 00:44:59.367
We have nobody on tickets.

1310
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.433
- What do you mean.
where's Laura?

1311
00:45:00.567 --> 00:45:02.400
- I had to move her
to the kid's station.

1312
00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:03.200
- Then why--

1313
00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:04.333
- I could do it.

1314
00:45:04.467 --> 00:45:05.433
- No. no. no. you don't have to.

1315
00:45:05.567 --> 00:45:06.233
No. let's just put Laura--

1316
00:45:06.367 --> 00:45:07.266
- Do you need the help?

1317
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.233
Be honest.

1318
00:45:10.166 --> 00:45:11.834
- I would write songs
of your heroism.

1319
00:45:11.967 --> 00:45:12.600
- Great. I'm on it.

1320
00:45:12.734 --> 00:45:13.667
Tickets.

1321
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.867
- Thank you. this way.
- Okay.

1322
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:15.767
- Yeah.

1323
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.333
(lighthearted music)

1324
00:45:18.467 --> 00:45:19.700
- Oh. show me the cornbread.

1325
00:45:20.834 --> 00:45:23.900
(lighthearted music)

1326
00:45:29.333 --> 00:45:31.233
All right. should be good now.

1327
00:45:35.367 --> 00:45:36.567
- Here you go.

1328
00:45:39.633 --> 00:45:41.867
There you go. enjoy yourself.

1329
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:51.767
- Hey there.

1330
00:45:52.834 --> 00:45:53.500
- Hey. (laughs)

1331
00:45:53.633 --> 00:45:54.533
- There you go.

1332
00:45:54.667 --> 00:45:55.633
- Thank you.

1333
00:45:58.467 --> 00:45:59.233
- Thank you.

1334
00:46:00.633 --> 00:46:01.433
- You're welcome.

1335
00:46:04.233 --> 00:46:05.767
What happened in there?

1336
00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.967
- Well. we've been running a
lot of events back to back.

1337
00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.567
I think I was a little
long on promises.

1338
00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.734
and a little short
on help on this one.

1339
00:46:12.867 --> 00:46:15.300
Turns out there may be
a limit to the whole

1340
00:46:15.433 --> 00:46:17.133
I can do it all philosophy.

1341
00:46:19.967 --> 00:46:22.767
What did you want
to talk to me about?

1342
00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.767
(clears throat)

1343
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:29.433
- So. my reporter dug up some
pretty powerful allegations

1344
00:46:29.567 --> 00:46:31.233
about Imperium National Bank.

1345
00:46:31.367 --> 00:46:33.800
claiming that they
were opening accounts

1346
00:46:33.934 --> 00:46:36.633
in customer's names
without their permission.

1347
00:46:36.767 --> 00:46:39.033
We have at least 20
people claiming that.

1348
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.633
- Hm.

1349
00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:44.533
- So...

1350
00:46:47.133 --> 00:46:48.033
Do you have a response?

1351
00:46:48.166 --> 00:46:52.066
- Oh. no. I mean. if
it's true. it's awful.

1352
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.333
- If it's true.

1353
00:46:53.467 --> 00:46:56.000
- Well. it's not sure. right?

1354
00:46:57.066 --> 00:46:58.233
And 20 people. serious.

1355
00:46:58.367 --> 00:47:00.133
but I have a bunch of
marketing analytics

1356
00:47:00.266 --> 00:47:02.667
that show thousands
of happy customers.

1357
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:09.000
- If it's true. it's only 20
people that we know about.

1358
00:47:09.133 --> 00:47:10.400
- I know this company.

1359
00:47:10.533 --> 00:47:12.533
I know the people
I work with here.

1360
00:47:12.667 --> 00:47:14.133
I just find it really
hard to believe

1361
00:47:14.266 --> 00:47:15.900
that they would do
something like that.

1362
00:47:17.934 --> 00:47:21.200
- When the story breaks.
you and I can't be together.

1363
00:47:21.333 --> 00:47:23.200
It would be an
ethical nightmare.

1364
00:47:23.333 --> 00:47:24.633
It would put your job at risk.

1365
00:47:24.767 --> 00:47:26.166
my job could be at risk.

1366
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.467
I think the most sensible thing

1367
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.133
would be for us to both
go our separate ways

1368
00:47:34.266 --> 00:47:35.500
before we both get hurt.

1369
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.100
- The thing is. I'm not
a very sensible guy.

1370
00:47:43.633 --> 00:47:45.734
You've laid out a
very compelling case

1371
00:47:45.867 --> 00:47:47.967
for all the things
that could go wrong.

1372
00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.567
but you know what?

1373
00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.000
I'm just not okay throwing
out all that's good here

1374
00:47:52.133 --> 00:47:54.300
based on something
that might happen.

1375
00:47:54.433 --> 00:47:57.033
That might happen.

1376
00:47:57.166 --> 00:47:59.533
This whole story
might fall through.

1377
00:47:59.667 --> 00:48:00.600
- It's just a matter of time

1378
00:48:00.734 --> 00:48:03.066
before we uncover and run it.

1379
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.233
- Apart?

1380
00:48:05.333 --> 00:48:07.033
Our only option is apart?

1381
00:48:07.166 --> 00:48:08.433
What if we stay together.

1382
00:48:08.567 --> 00:48:10.066
we cross that bridge
when we come to it?

1383
00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.300
Who knows what solutions we
might find along the way?

1384
00:48:14.934 --> 00:48:15.967
Okay. if this all blows up.

1385
00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.133
I'm gonna keep the receipts
from this conversation.

1386
00:48:19.266 --> 00:48:21.200
and I promise you I
am going to shoulder

1387
00:48:21.333 --> 00:48:23.000
100% of the blame.

1388
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.000
- Okay.

1389
00:48:30.133 --> 00:48:33.367
If we're going to cross that
bridge when we come to it.

1390
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.233
we're gonna have to angle
down that road pretty slowly.

1391
00:48:36.367 --> 00:48:37.800
- Agreed.

1392
00:48:37.934 --> 00:48:39.734
- I'm not the one who jumps
head first into things.

1393
00:48:39.867 --> 00:48:41.300
- Oh. I hear you. I'm with you.

1394
00:48:42.567 --> 00:48:44.100
We'll go slow until
we're in the clear.

1395
00:48:47.567 --> 00:48:48.734
- Okay.

1396
00:48:48.867 --> 00:48:51.233
I'm uncalling it. but
with a firm speed limit

1397
00:48:51.367 --> 00:48:53.800
of 35 miles an hour.

1398
00:48:53.934 --> 00:48:54.900
- That sounds fair.

1399
00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:57.033
- Yeah.

1400
00:48:57.166 --> 00:48:59.700
- To be clear. would
kissing you right now

1401
00:48:59.834 --> 00:49:04.033
be like. 35 miles an hour.

1402
00:49:04.166 --> 00:49:07.333
or would that be like
65 miles an hour?

1403
00:49:07.467 --> 00:49:10.533
(lighthearted music)

1404
00:49:11.967 --> 00:49:12.800
- Goodnight. Tom.

1405
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.200
(lighthearted music)

1406
00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:27.667
- For Wake Up Milwaukee.
I'm Kelly Leone.

1407
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.500
(speaking in foreign language)

1408
00:49:30.633 --> 00:49:32.333
Great. I think we got it.

1409
00:49:32.467 --> 00:49:34.200
You can head off.
thank you so much.

1410
00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:36.767
- Hey there.

1411
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:40.166
(speaking in foreign language)

1412
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:42.367
- It's Happy New
Year in Mandarin.

1413
00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.266
- Mm!

1414
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.066
- You ready for this?

1415
00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.367
- Not nearly as ready
as you are. clearly.

1416
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.200
however. I'm equally as excited.

1417
00:49:49.333 --> 00:49:50.266
Are you doing a segment?

1418
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:51.200
- We just wrapped up.

1419
00:49:51.333 --> 00:49:52.266
I thought it might be good

1420
00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.333
to set some
professional boundaries.

1421
00:49:54.467 --> 00:49:56.266
- Or you don't want to
share the limelight with me.

1422
00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.166
It's okay. I get it.
you're a big star.

1423
00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.200
I don't want to
steal your thunder.

1424
00:50:00.333 --> 00:50:02.900
- Please. I cannot wait for
this segment to be over.

1425
00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:04.266
- What?

1426
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.467
You're so good at it!

1427
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.166
- You're sweet.

1428
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.467
- Stop it!

1429
00:50:09.233 --> 00:50:11.100
That would fall
into sugar coating.

1430
00:50:11.233 --> 00:50:12.500
which is very
strictly forbidden.

1431
00:50:12.633 --> 00:50:15.233
Yes. I am biased. and so I think

1432
00:50:15.367 --> 00:50:17.367
you're amazing on camera.

1433
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.667
It's got me wondering what
you're doing behind it.

1434
00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.200
- I figured out pretty early on

1435
00:50:21.333 --> 00:50:23.066
I'm more of a behind the scenes.

1436
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.367
magically make things happen.

1437
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.600
and then swoop away
unseen kind of person.

1438
00:50:27.734 --> 00:50:31.600
The trusty Sancho to our
anchor's Don Quixote.

1439
00:50:31.734 --> 00:50:33.166
- Ah. I don't see you like that.

1440
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.600
as the trusty sidekick.

1441
00:50:34.734 --> 00:50:35.867
In the few short
weeks I've known you.

1442
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.266
you've always stood
out as the star.

1443
00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.567
- Well. you're meeting
me at a weird time.

1444
00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.734
- Maybe. or maybe you should
just admit to yourself

1445
00:50:43.867 --> 00:50:45.333
that a teeny-tiny part of you

1446
00:50:45.467 --> 00:50:46.433
does like being in
front of the camera.

1447
00:50:46.567 --> 00:50:49.367
- Uh. in front of camera. no.

1448
00:50:50.533 --> 00:50:52.367
In front of an audience. um--

1449
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.700
- What?

1450
00:50:53.834 --> 00:50:54.500
- Nothing.

1451
00:50:54.633 --> 00:50:56.433
- Whoa. wait.

1452
00:50:56.567 --> 00:50:57.300
Tell me.

1453
00:50:59.033 --> 00:51:02.667
- I used to do all
these storytelling
open mics in college.

1454
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.133
You know. where
they give a theme.

1455
00:51:04.266 --> 00:51:05.467
and then you have
to tell a story.

1456
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.967
and it's under five minutes.

1457
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.500
- Sure. I know.

1458
00:51:08.633 --> 00:51:09.600
I'm talking to Story Slam
about sponsoring an event

1459
00:51:09.734 --> 00:51:10.934
in late February.

1460
00:51:11.066 --> 00:51:12.100
- They're the ones
with the podcast.

1461
00:51:12.233 --> 00:51:13.300
I love them.

1462
00:51:14.266 --> 00:51:14.967
- You should do it.

1463
00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.233
- Oh. I don't know.

1464
00:51:16.367 --> 00:51:18.567
- I'm inviting you to perform.

1465
00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.233
Part of your resolution.

1466
00:51:20.367 --> 00:51:21.967
- It'll be over by then.

1467
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:23.300
My birthday's February 8th.

1468
00:51:23.433 --> 00:51:25.633
- Oh. right!

1469
00:51:25.767 --> 00:51:26.533
Is it a big one?

1470
00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.066
- 30. actually.

1471
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.300
My friends are throwing
me a birthday party

1472
00:51:31.433 --> 00:51:32.800
that Saturday if you want to--

1473
00:51:32.934 --> 00:51:34.266
- Love to.

1474
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.166
- Great.

1475
00:51:37.533 --> 00:51:39.633
There's a market. we
could grab some food

1476
00:51:39.767 --> 00:51:40.900
and walk around?

1477
00:51:41.033 --> 00:51:42.100
- Absolutely.

1478
00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:47.333
(traditional Chinese music)

1479
00:52:01.967 --> 00:52:05.233
- I swear. that was my first
and only speed dating event.

1480
00:52:05.367 --> 00:52:06.533
It just wasn't my--

1481
00:52:06.667 --> 00:52:07.633
- Speed?

1482
00:52:07.767 --> 00:52:08.967
(laughing)

1483
00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.233
They're the most
awkward things ever.

1484
00:52:11.533 --> 00:52:12.800
- In case you haven't noticed.

1485
00:52:12.934 --> 00:52:15.033
small talk is not my forte.

1486
00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:17.333
- You're in good company.

1487
00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:19.066
my conversation falls
on the deep end.

1488
00:52:20.467 --> 00:52:23.600
But now. I kind of want
to hear your small talk.

1489
00:52:26.033 --> 00:52:27.467
- What's the most
embarrassing thing

1490
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.800
that's ever happened to you?

1491
00:52:28.934 --> 00:52:30.367
- That's like Mt. Everest talk.

1492
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.200
(laughing)

1493
00:52:32.333 --> 00:52:33.500
- Okay. okay.

1494
00:52:33.633 --> 00:52:34.367
You go.

1495
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:35.900
- Okay.

1496
00:52:36.033 --> 00:52:37.567
What's your favorite
childhood book?

1497
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.066
- "Velveteen Rabbit".

1498
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:39.867
- Never read it.

1499
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.667
- What?

1500
00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.233
It's a classic!

1501
00:52:42.367 --> 00:52:44.367
- Yeah. I was always a "Where
the Wild Things Are" fan.

1502
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:45.533
- Hm.

1503
00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.700
What did you want to
be when you grew up?

1504
00:52:49.767 --> 00:52:51.233
- Batman.

1505
00:52:51.367 --> 00:52:52.200
- Hm.

1506
00:52:52.333 --> 00:52:53.834
- No. I didn't know
what I wanted to be.

1507
00:52:53.967 --> 00:52:56.367
but I knew I wanted
to live in Chicago.

1508
00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.400
- Really?

1509
00:52:57.533 --> 00:52:58.233
- Mhm.

1510
00:52:58.367 --> 00:52:59.100
- So did I.

1511
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.700
Why didn't you do it?

1512
00:53:01.834 --> 00:53:04.567
- Ooh. that story
is not smalltalk.

1513
00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.066
We're gonna table that
talk until date four.

1514
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.734
- Oh.

1515
00:53:09.867 --> 00:53:11.834
So. there's a date four?

1516
00:53:13.066 --> 00:53:14.934
(laughing)

1517
00:53:15.066 --> 00:53:16.100
- Okay. next question.

1518
00:53:16.233 --> 00:53:18.400
Where do you see
yourself in five years?

1519
00:53:18.533 --> 00:53:19.300
- Ooh.

1520
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.767
I'm an Emmy winning
news producer

1521
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.934
in a big city like Chicago.

1522
00:53:28.533 --> 00:53:29.967
- Yes.

1523
00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.600
I feel like that's
a matter of time.

1524
00:53:33.867 --> 00:53:36.633
- Eh. it's a matter
of timing. and luck.

1525
00:53:36.767 --> 00:53:39.133
and maybe a unicorn or two.

1526
00:53:39.266 --> 00:53:41.100
(chuckling)

1527
00:53:41.233 --> 00:53:43.667
- I think it's just a
matter of you saying yes.

1528
00:53:44.567 --> 00:53:45.667
- What about you?

1529
00:53:48.266 --> 00:53:49.266
- Is it a full moon?

1530
00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.066
- Tom! (laughing)

1531
00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.233
- Is that a full moon?

1532
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.367
Probably at Imperium
National Bank.

1533
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:56.400
I love the job.

1534
00:53:57.734 --> 00:53:58.900
So. when I got out of college.

1535
00:53:59.033 --> 00:54:00.266
I didn't know what
I wanted to do.

1536
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.300
and they took a mouth
on this loudmouthed.

1537
00:54:03.433 --> 00:54:06.600
opinionated. desperate
to please 22 year old.

1538
00:54:06.734 --> 00:54:07.667
and they mentored me.

1539
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.200
and they gave me an opportunity

1540
00:54:10.333 --> 00:54:12.066
to build something
in my department.

1541
00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.633
Not only that. they're
this massive institution.

1542
00:54:15.767 --> 00:54:16.433
and so I feel like
there's lots of--

1543
00:54:16.567 --> 00:54:18.033
- Possibilities?

1544
00:54:18.166 --> 00:54:18.900
- Yeah.

1545
00:54:19.567 --> 00:54:21.467
I know it sounds lame to--

1546
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.600
- No.

1547
00:54:22.734 --> 00:54:24.500
It doesn't sound lame.

1548
00:54:24.633 --> 00:54:25.667
It sounds brave.

1549
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.033
(lighthearted music)

1550
00:54:29.166 --> 00:54:31.533
- Never really thought
of it that way.

1551
00:54:31.667 --> 00:54:32.834
(chuckling)

1552
00:54:32.967 --> 00:54:36.033
- Wow. we are really
bad at smalltalk.

1553
00:54:36.166 --> 00:54:37.433
(laughing)

1554
00:54:37.567 --> 00:54:39.166
I get why you'd would
want to be loyal.

1555
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.467
but I just can't get those
stories out of my head.

1556
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.433
- Well. I'm not
saying I don't believe

1557
00:54:43.567 --> 00:54:44.767
the stories are real.

1558
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.467
I'm just saying. I find
it very hard to believe

1559
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.633
that the company I
know would do that.

1560
00:54:48.767 --> 00:54:49.700
- It makes sense.

1561
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.200
- Hey. I wanna talk about when

1562
00:54:51.333 --> 00:54:52.633
I'm gonna see you again.

1563
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
- I'm free Saturday.

1564
00:54:56.133 --> 00:54:57.600
- All right.

1565
00:54:57.734 --> 00:54:59.200
I have my niece's birthday
party in the morning.

1566
00:54:59.333 --> 00:55:01.667
and then I have this big
gala thing in the evening?

1567
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:05.333
- Well then. what
about next week?

1568
00:55:05.467 --> 00:55:06.233
- Mm...

1569
00:55:07.467 --> 00:55:09.367
I don't want a wait
a week to see you.

1570
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.333
How about I could swing
by and scoop you up

1571
00:55:12.467 --> 00:55:14.667
on the way back from
my sister's house?

1572
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.367
- Has anyone ever told you

1573
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.867
you might have a slight
problem with over-committing?

1574
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.667
- Only every day of my life.

1575
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.667
(chuckling)

1576
00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.800
Come on.

1577
00:55:26.033 --> 00:55:28.233
- I don't want to pile on to
your already crazy day with--

1578
00:55:28.367 --> 00:55:29.133
- You're not.

1579
00:55:29.834 --> 00:55:31.600
You are worth making time for.

1580
00:55:32.867 --> 00:55:35.700
I'm asking. which means
you have to say yes.

1581
00:55:35.834 --> 00:55:38.200
and I don't feel about
that one little bit.

1582
00:55:38.333 --> 00:55:40.767
because I know you'd only
be saying no for my sake.

1583
00:55:41.967 --> 00:55:42.734
Right?

1584
00:55:44.667 --> 00:55:45.433
- Yes.

1585
00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.200
Saturday.

1586
00:55:48.066 --> 00:55:49.700
- Yes!

1587
00:55:49.834 --> 00:55:52.700
(lighthearted music)

1588
00:55:54.633 --> 00:55:55.333
- Goodnight. Tom.

1589
00:55:55.467 --> 00:55:57.033
(laughing)

1590
00:55:57.166 --> 00:55:57.934
- Goodnight.

1591
00:55:59.667 --> 00:56:00.767
- Whew!

1592
00:56:08.033 --> 00:56:12.133
to last year.

1593
00:56:12.266 --> 00:56:14.834
(phone ringing)

1594
00:56:17.633 --> 00:56:18.834
Hey!

1595
00:56:18.967 --> 00:56:20.834
I was just working
on my Story Slam.

1596
00:56:20.967 --> 00:56:23.734
- So. I am going to try and
word this very carefully

1597
00:56:23.867 --> 00:56:25.734
so it is not an invitation.

1598
00:56:26.567 --> 00:56:28.700
Freedom of choice is
very important here.

1599
00:56:28.834 --> 00:56:30.133
- Okay?

1600
00:56:30.266 --> 00:56:34.000
- I was thinking it
could be a fun adventure

1601
00:56:34.133 --> 00:56:37.633
if. maybe you wanted
to come with me today.

1602
00:56:37.767 --> 00:56:41.700
- To your niece's
birthday. or the gala?

1603
00:56:41.834 --> 00:56:42.600
- Both!

1604
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.200
- Oh...

1605
00:56:45.333 --> 00:56:47.633
- Look. I realize it's
an insane proposition

1606
00:56:47.767 --> 00:56:51.400
for a third date. usually
to try to spread out

1607
00:56:51.533 --> 00:56:54.200
like a big work event with
meeting the family over months.

1608
00:56:54.333 --> 00:56:56.467
- Or. you know. years.

1609
00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:57.633
- You know what?

1610
00:56:57.767 --> 00:56:58.967
This is. you don't
have to do it.

1611
00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.233
Now that I hear
it out loud. it--

1612
00:57:01.367 --> 00:57:02.333
- What do I wear?

1613
00:57:03.834 --> 00:57:05.900
- Comfy for family.
evening gown for the gala?

1614
00:57:06.033 --> 00:57:07.800
Sorry. I realize
most third dates

1615
00:57:07.934 --> 00:57:09.767
don't usually come
with a costume change.

1616
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.233
- Okay. I've gotta
figure out what to wear.

1617
00:57:12.367 --> 00:57:13.767
I'll see you in 30.

1618
00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:16.767
(lighthearted music)

1619
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:18.700
- It's not too late to back out.

1620
00:57:18.834 --> 00:57:20.300
We can still hop back in the car

1621
00:57:20.433 --> 00:57:22.667
and hightail it across
the border to Canada.

1622
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:24.967
- Uncle Tommy!
- Uncle Tommy!

1623
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:26.200
- Hey!

1624
00:57:26.333 --> 00:57:27.867
Oh. thank you. my loves.

1625
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.800
- You must be Kelly.

1626
00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.934
- Hi!

1627
00:57:32.066 --> 00:57:33.433
Thank you for letting me crash.

1628
00:57:33.567 --> 00:57:34.633
- Come on in. I'll
introduce you to everyone.

1629
00:57:34.767 --> 00:57:36.133
- Yeah. let's go
inside. it's freezing.

1630
00:57:37.367 --> 00:57:38.033
When. last night?

1631
00:57:38.166 --> 00:57:38.934
- So much fun.

1632
00:57:39.066 --> 00:57:40.567
Everybody. this is Kelly.

1633
00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:43.100
she is a friend of Tommy's.
so make her feel welcome.

1634
00:57:43.233 --> 00:57:44.400
- Hi. Kelly!
(laughing)

1635
00:57:44.533 --> 00:57:46.600
- Okay. Kelly. this is
our birthday girl Angie.

1636
00:57:46.734 --> 00:57:47.600
and this is Emmie.

1637
00:57:47.734 --> 00:57:49.900
and girls. this is
my new friend. Kelly.

1638
00:57:50.033 --> 00:57:52.133
So. she has a super cool job.

1639
00:57:52.266 --> 00:57:55.066
She actually is in
charge of a TV show.

1640
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:55.967
- Whoa. really?

1641
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.266
- Kelly?

1642
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.033
Would you mind giving
me a hand with the cake?

1643
00:57:58.166 --> 00:57:59.266
- Yeah. sure thing.

1644
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.967
- Okay. show me
what you got so far.

1645
00:58:01.734 --> 00:58:04.367
- So. meeting the
family on date three.

1646
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.934
This is really throwing
you into the lion's den.

1647
00:58:07.066 --> 00:58:08.667
- Normally that
would be a hard pass.

1648
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.600
but this family came
pretty highly reviewed.

1649
00:58:11.734 --> 00:58:12.367
- Aw.

1650
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.100
- And he's pretty great.

1651
00:58:14.233 --> 00:58:15.367
- Yeah. we'll keep him.

1652
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:18.767
You know. Tommy's
always running around

1653
00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.533
and thinking about
everyone else.

1654
00:58:20.667 --> 00:58:22.467
- That sounds about right.

1655
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:23.867
- Takes really good care of us.

1656
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.033
But he doesn't always
show us him. you know?

1657
00:58:28.166 --> 00:58:29.834
What's really going
on in his life.

1658
00:58:29.967 --> 00:58:31.867
So. for him to bring you here.

1659
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.700
he must really like you.

1660
00:58:33.834 --> 00:58:35.100
(lighthearted music)

1661
00:58:35.233 --> 00:58:38.633
♪ Happy Birthday to you

1662
00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.300
- I know you've been
running around all January.

1663
00:58:42.433 --> 00:58:47.400
and so I thought a little
R&amp;R might be in order.

1664
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.900
(lighthearted music)

1665
00:58:53.834 --> 00:58:55.000
I'm going out on a limb here.

1666
00:58:55.133 --> 00:58:56.834
but I thought we might
find the perfect hybrid

1667
00:58:56.967 --> 00:59:00.533
between relaxing and
competitive vibes.

1668
00:59:00.667 --> 00:59:01.600
- It's perfect.

1669
00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.266
It's really perfect.

1670
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.367
- Okay.

1671
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.266
Come on in.

1672
00:59:07.133 --> 00:59:08.533
You pick out a game.

1673
00:59:08.667 --> 00:59:12.934
and I'm gonna go grab
us a hot chocolate and--

1674
00:59:13.066 --> 00:59:13.867
- Make it two.

1675
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:15.767
- You got it.

1676
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:18.967
(lighthearted music)

1677
00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:27.333
(laughing)

1678
00:59:27.467 --> 00:59:30.400
Oh. all the board games.
and she chose checkers.

1679
00:59:31.567 --> 00:59:33.433
- Checkers is the perfect game.

1680
00:59:33.567 --> 00:59:35.567
Lower bar to entry that chess.

1681
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.567
but it lets you know
who your opponent is.

1682
00:59:39.166 --> 00:59:40.600
- And when I picked
a board game bar--

1683
00:59:40.734 --> 00:59:43.233
- You had no idea
what you unleashed.

1684
00:59:45.567 --> 00:59:47.400
- In the spirit of relaxation.

1685
00:59:47.533 --> 00:59:49.734
I'm gonna say a total
ban on all work talk.

1686
00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:51.700
- Agree.

1687
00:59:54.734 --> 00:59:56.300
All right. I have a question.

1688
00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:59.567
- Why didn't you
move to Chicago?

1689
00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:01.600
Wasn't that your
childhood dream?

1690
01:00:01.734 --> 01:00:05.567
- I'm so sorry. we table
that topic until date four.

1691
01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.066
- Hm. yeah.

1692
01:00:08.233 --> 01:00:09.867
But then I meet
your entire family.

1693
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.500
which would've been date three.

1694
01:00:11.633 --> 01:00:14.867
and I'd say now we're
solidly on date four.

1695
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.834
- That's what I get for
full steam ahead. huh?

1696
01:00:17.967 --> 01:00:20.333
I was kinda hoping you'd
forget that little detail.

1697
01:00:20.467 --> 01:00:21.834
- Eh. that's what you get
for dating a news producer.

1698
01:00:21.967 --> 01:00:24.000
- I don't know.

1699
01:00:24.133 --> 01:00:27.700
I guess. I always liked
the idea of Chicago.

1700
01:00:27.834 --> 01:00:32.800
but the reality of leaving
my family seemed hard.

1701
01:00:34.033 --> 01:00:35.166
- Your family seems
really supportive.

1702
01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.567
- They are. and
they are. it's just.

1703
01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.700
Sheila's raising
two kids by herself.

1704
01:00:39.834 --> 01:00:41.900
she basically helped raise me.

1705
01:00:42.033 --> 01:00:43.734
And it's not like I'm
saying that she's all alone

1706
01:00:43.867 --> 01:00:44.567
in this big family.

1707
01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.433
but I don't know.

1708
01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:51.433
I just feel better
knowing that I'm there.

1709
01:00:51.567 --> 01:00:53.500
And besides. I can't
just move to Chicago

1710
01:00:53.633 --> 01:00:56.433
because I feel like it.

1711
01:00:56.567 --> 01:01:00.433
I need to know that there's
a reason. or a job--

1712
01:01:00.567 --> 01:01:02.700
- Or a plan. Mr. Possibilities?

1713
01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.967
- Not a plan. per se.
I just need to know

1714
01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.834
that I'm moving towards
a goal. you know?

1715
01:01:07.967 --> 01:01:12.700
That there's something
specific there that I want.

1716
01:01:15.233 --> 01:01:17.900
- Look. I think our
reactions to chaos

1717
01:01:18.033 --> 01:01:19.633
are very opposite.

1718
01:01:20.767 --> 01:01:22.900
I tend to slow
down and pull back.

1719
01:01:23.033 --> 01:01:25.433
and you keep on moving.

1720
01:01:26.467 --> 01:01:31.000
But I think the struggle. the
fear to name what we want.

1721
01:01:32.633 --> 01:01:33.867
I think that's the same.

1722
01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:36.734
I really do.

1723
01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:41.266
- But hey. you actually
made a resolution.

1724
01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.834
You got out there.
you went curling.

1725
01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:45.266
you went speed dating.

1726
01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.233
You carpe'd the cheese fries.

1727
01:01:47.367 --> 01:01:50.000
(laughing)

1728
01:01:50.133 --> 01:01:52.767
So. now that we're almost
at the end of the month.

1729
01:01:53.934 --> 01:01:54.700
what do you want?

1730
01:01:57.767 --> 01:01:59.667
(exhales)

1731
01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:03.734
- You know. when I
made the resolution.

1732
01:02:03.867 --> 01:02:05.834
it was pretty clear.

1733
01:02:06.633 --> 01:02:09.867
But. a lot can
happen in a month.

1734
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.633
- What sage said that?

1735
01:02:14.767 --> 01:02:16.233
That's like. really wise.

1736
01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:20.233
(laughing)

1737
01:02:21.433 --> 01:02:23.533
- Uh. we have to
leave in 15 minutes.

1738
01:02:24.266 --> 01:02:26.533
- Are you producing our date?

1739
01:02:26.667 --> 01:02:28.066
- Maybe.

1740
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.000
(laughing)

1741
01:02:30.133 --> 01:02:32.567
(lighthearted music)

1742
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.400
- How are you doing in there?

1743
01:02:34.533 --> 01:02:36.500
Car's gonna be here
in two minutes.

1744
01:02:36.633 --> 01:02:38.066
- [Kelly] Hey. if
I'm going undercover.

1745
01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.700
I need to look the part.

1746
01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:42.667
I'm kidding. Tom.

1747
01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.567
But. while we're on the subject.

1748
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.834
one of our sources
brought in some paperwork.

1749
01:02:46.967 --> 01:02:48.367
and it looks like
the salespeople

1750
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.700
are opening accounts
under the customer's name.

1751
01:02:50.834 --> 01:02:52.467
and sending statements
to their own

1752
01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.300
personal addresses to cover it.

1753
01:02:54.433 --> 01:02:55.467
- Okay.

1754
01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.000
So you feel like that's
the most likely scenario?

1755
01:02:58.133 --> 01:03:00.700
- [Kelly] It's not my job to
assume the best in people.

1756
01:03:00.834 --> 01:03:02.767
- I feel really weird
talking to you about this

1757
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:03.633
without being able
to read your face.

1758
01:03:03.767 --> 01:03:04.700
Can we open the--

1759
01:03:04.834 --> 01:03:05.600
- [Kelly] Not ready yet!

1760
01:03:05.734 --> 01:03:06.734
- Okay.

1761
01:03:06.867 --> 01:03:08.800
So. what's holding you back

1762
01:03:08.934 --> 01:03:10.266
from just running the story?

1763
01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.700
- [Kelly] It'd be
better if we could get

1764
01:03:11.834 --> 01:03:13.433
a confirmation from the inside.

1765
01:03:13.567 --> 01:03:15.734
- I can just take some of the
sales team out for drinks.

1766
01:03:15.867 --> 01:03:17.133
I do that all the time.

1767
01:03:17.266 --> 01:03:17.767
- [Kelly] Okay.

1768
01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:19.100
If this is gonna work.

1769
01:03:19.233 --> 01:03:21.967
you cannot say
anything to anyone.

1770
01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.867
- Yeah. I can do that.

1771
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.767
It's actually kind of exciting.

1772
01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.734
I feel like I'm an
undercover reporter.

1773
01:03:27.867 --> 01:03:28.700
- [Kelly] Seriously. Tom.

1774
01:03:28.834 --> 01:03:30.633
The only way this
works is if you and I

1775
01:03:30.767 --> 01:03:32.233
are on the same page.

1776
01:03:32.367 --> 01:03:33.867
We have to trust each other.

1777
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.266
You'd have to come to me first.

1778
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.800
- Yeah. I get that.

1779
01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:39.600
- [Kelly] I feel really anxious.

1780
01:03:39.734 --> 01:03:42.467
I haven't dressed up this
fancy in a long time.

1781
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.900
- I'm sure you look...

1782
01:03:45.233 --> 01:03:48.333
(lighthearted music)

1783
01:03:50.767 --> 01:03:52.633
- Please finish that sentence.

1784
01:03:52.767 --> 01:03:53.800
- Breathtaking.

1785
01:03:56.767 --> 01:04:01.834

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.100
- The obstacle course was
a bit more of a challenge

1790
01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:23.800
than I thought. but once
I got the hang of it--

1791

was probably the wildest.

So. your Saturday's

biggest problem is

that these customers don't
know what's good for them.

have been really
hard to meet lately.

1845
01:07:15.533 --> 01:07:18.333
- Yeah. it seems like sales
goals have been pretty high.

1846

so I'm hoping that
with the right events.

we can bring in more people.

1848
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.567
- It's not the number of people.

1849
01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.900
it's the amount of product.

1850
01:07:24.033 --> 01:07:25.533
- I don't understand.

1851
01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:28.333
- So. each account.
each credit card.

1852
01:07:28.467 --> 01:07:30.500
it's a different product.

1853
01:07:30.633 --> 01:07:31.667
- Mhm.

1854
01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.667
- So you could have 10
customers with an account each.

1855
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.600
or you could have one customer
with two checking accounts.

1856
01:07:36.734 --> 01:07:39.266
a savings account. a CD.
a couple credit cards?

1857
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.567
- Okay. so you're saying that

1858
01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:42.500
it's about finding
the right customers.

1859
01:07:42.633 --> 01:07:43.500
It's quality over quantity.

1860
01:07:43.633 --> 01:07:45.066
- Right.

1861
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:46.567
We want to be the one
stop shop for everything.

1862
01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.233
- You know. plus it doesn't hurt

1863
01:07:48.367 --> 01:07:50.266
that we get a fee on
every account we open.

1864
01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:52.767
- Right. that's...

1865
01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.667
Paul. what did you
mean when you said

1866
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.767
that the customer doesn't
know what's good for them?

1867
01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:04.800
(mysterious music)

1868
01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.834
- This is bad. this is--

1869
01:08:08.967 --> 01:08:09.600
- Fraud.

1870
01:08:09.734 --> 01:08:10.934
- Yeah.

1871
01:08:11.066 --> 01:08:13.066
- I really didn't
think it was true.

1872
01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.500
- So. what did Glenn say?

1873
01:08:16.066 --> 01:08:17.734
- I haven't told him yet.

1874
01:08:17.867 --> 01:08:19.333
- But you are gonna
tell him. right?

1875
01:08:19.467 --> 01:08:20.900
- Kelly made me promise that
I would come to her first.

1876
01:08:21.033 --> 01:08:22.133
- If you go to her first.

1877
01:08:22.266 --> 01:08:23.500
she's gonna blow
this thing right up.

1878
01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:25.967
- I promised her I
would go to her first.

1879
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.100
If I break this promise.
then this is over.

1880
01:08:29.233 --> 01:08:30.500
- Come on.

1881
01:08:30.633 --> 01:08:33.133
You love what you do.
and you're great at it.

1882
01:08:33.266 --> 01:08:36.333
and you do a lot of
good for the community.

1883
01:08:36.467 --> 01:08:37.900
If you don't go to Glenn first.

1884
01:08:38.033 --> 01:08:39.133
all of that goes away.

1885
01:08:42.266 --> 01:08:44.266
I'm just looking out for you.

1886
01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.500
- But this isn't
about me anymore.

1887
01:08:45.633 --> 01:08:48.500
this is 20 people
that we know of.

1888
01:08:48.633 --> 01:08:50.233
It could be hundreds.
it could be thousands.

1889
01:08:50.367 --> 01:08:51.133
- Or it could not.

1890
01:08:51.266 --> 01:08:53.467
It could be three bad eggs.

1891
01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.600
What if you go to Glenn.

1892
01:08:55.734 --> 01:08:57.066
and there's a way
to make this right

1893
01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.567
without damaging the
company's reputation?

1894
01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.500
- She still trusted
me with her story.

1895
01:09:01.633 --> 01:09:03.300
- And she'll still have a story.

1896
01:09:03.433 --> 01:09:04.734
Only this one's gonna be about

1897
01:09:04.867 --> 01:09:06.333
the employees that went rogue.

1898
01:09:06.467 --> 01:09:07.567
and the company that
did the right thing

1899
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:09.567
for its customers.

1900
01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.834
I mean. everyone wins.
everyone's happy.

1901
01:09:11.967 --> 01:09:13.300
Right?

1902
01:09:13.433 --> 01:09:16.800
(lighthearted music)

1903
01:09:16.934 --> 01:09:19.900
(catchy band music)

1904
01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:30.133
- Hey.

1905
01:09:30.266 --> 01:09:30.900
- You made it. yay!

1906
01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:31.700
- Wouldn't miss it.

1907
01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.734
(laughing)

1908
01:09:33.867 --> 01:09:35.700
To be honest. I was
a little surprised

1909
01:09:35.834 --> 01:09:36.800
about the Gatsby theme.

1910
01:09:36.934 --> 01:09:40.033
- Oh. this is vintage Kelly.

1911
01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:42.533
Back in college. getting
her to go out with us

1912
01:09:42.667 --> 01:09:44.200
was like pulling teeth.

1913
01:09:44.333 --> 01:09:46.734
but a theme party?

1914
01:09:46.867 --> 01:09:48.033
You couldn't keep her home.

1915
01:09:48.967 --> 01:09:49.633
- Huh.

1916
01:09:49.767 --> 01:09:51.066
And Gatsby?

1917
01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.066
- What can I say?

1918
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.867
The key to the girl's heart
is books and boardgames.

1919
01:09:57.667 --> 01:09:58.567
- You made it!

1920
01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.500
- Hey!

1921
01:09:59.633 --> 01:10:01.100
Yeah. of course. I
wouldn't miss it.

1922
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.700
You look. wow.

1923
01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.367
This is for you.

1924
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.400
- Oh.

1925
01:10:08.533 --> 01:10:09.333
You didn't have to.

1926
01:10:09.467 --> 01:10:10.333
- Of course I did.

1927
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:17.467
Okay. so. they worked with
the original artist's grandson

1928
01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.967
to restore the illustrations.

1929
01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.166
and then this is a brand new.

1930
01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.567
never before seen cover.

1931
01:10:23.467 --> 01:10:24.734
- It's perfect.

1932
01:10:24.867 --> 01:10:25.667
- Yeah?

1933
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.066
- I love it. thank you.

1934
01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.500

the park. my guy.

1935
01:10:29.633 --> 01:10:30.300
Well done.

1936
01:10:30.433 --> 01:10:31.967

1937
01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.000
(chuckling)

1938
01:10:34.133 --> 01:10:35.967
- Okay. I would love
to make a toast.

1939
01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.500
- [Lisa] Oh!

1940
01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:40.900
- To Kelly. on your 30th.

1941
01:10:41.033 --> 01:10:43.567

perfect grand experiment

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.066
You are an inspiration
to your whole community.

1944
01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.433
the best friend
we could ask for.

1945

1947
01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.633
- No.

- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1951

- Cheers!
- Cheers. cheers.

1952
01:11:05.767 --> 01:11:08.633
- So. resolution's over.

1953
01:11:08.767 --> 01:11:09.567
How do you feel?

1954
01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:16.400
- I was within and
without simultaneously.

1955
01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:18.600
enchanted and repelled.

1956
01:11:18.734 --> 01:11:22.166
by the inexhaustible
variety of life.

1957
01:11:25.066 --> 01:11:26.166
Okay.

1958
01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.266
Did nobody here read "The
Great Gatsby" in high school?

1959
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.233
- Yeah.
- Read what?

1960
01:11:30.367 --> 01:11:31.533
- Yeah. absolutely.

1961
01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:32.300
(laughing)

1962
01:11:32.433 --> 01:11:34.200
- I love you guys.

1963
01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:35.400
Come on. let's go dance.

1964
01:11:35.533 --> 01:11:36.367
- Wait. Kel. I--

1965
01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.233
- You heard the birthday
girl. let's move.

1966
01:11:39.934 --> 01:11:42.934
(catchy band music)

1967
01:11:46.367 --> 01:11:47.433
- Word to the wise.

1968
01:11:47.567 --> 01:11:50.633
Kelly won't let anyone avoid
the dance floor for long.

1969
01:11:50.767 --> 01:11:51.567
You ready?

1970
01:11:52.734 --> 01:11:54.567
- You go ahead. I'm not feeling

1971
01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:56.400
the whole dance floor
thing right now.

1972
01:11:56.533 --> 01:11:57.266
- I have a feeling
the birthday girl's

1973
01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.400
not gonna take
that for an answer.

1974
01:11:59.533 --> 01:12:00.700
It's kinda nice though.

1975
01:12:01.967 --> 01:12:03.500
I've never seen her
this happy before.

1976
01:12:04.633 --> 01:12:06.734
(chuckling)

1977
01:12:10.633 --> 01:12:11.700
- You're right. it's a
celebration. come on.

1978
01:12:11.834 --> 01:12:13.467
- Let's go!

1979
01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.166
(catchy music)

1980
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:19.033
(lighthearted music)

1981
01:12:19.166 --> 01:12:20.467
- Thanks for the coffee.

1982
01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.467
- Yeah.

1983
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.166
- Birthday surprises
just keep on coming.

1984
01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.533
- Yeah. I'm the gift
that keeps on giving.

1985
01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:26.467
- Welcome.

1986
01:12:27.967 --> 01:12:30.333
- Hey. look. yesterday
at work before the party.

1987
01:12:30.467 --> 01:12:31.700
I wanted to talk to you.

1988
01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:33.533
- Sorry. it's
Casey. my reporter.

1989
01:12:33.667 --> 01:12:34.333
I'll just be a second.

1990
01:12:34.467 --> 01:12:35.133
- Actually. wait. Kelly.

1991
01:12:35.266 --> 01:12:36.467
- Hey. Case. what's up?

1992
01:12:37.834 --> 01:12:39.700
Wait. wait. wait.
slow down. slow down.

1993
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.133
What do you mean they
closed all the accounts?

1994
01:12:45.266 --> 01:12:46.800
Well. we have the record.

1995
01:12:46.934 --> 01:12:48.567
so I'm not worried.

1996
01:12:50.233 --> 01:12:53.200
If anything. it makes them look
a lot worse than we thought.

1997
01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.667
Okay.

1998
01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.133
Well. figure it out.
and call me back.

1999
01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:07.200
Uh. so Imperium National Bank

2000
01:13:07.333 --> 01:13:09.066
closed all the
accounts in question.

2001
01:13:09.834 --> 01:13:11.000
- They closed them.

2002
01:13:11.133 --> 01:13:12.266
What do you mean
they closed them?

2003
01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.066
Did they reach out to
the customers first?

2004
01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.166
- I'm gonna give you the
benefit of the doubt here

2005
01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:22.266
and ask if you think the
timing is suspicious?

2006
01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:24.400
- No. hey. I took the
sales team out for drinks.

2007
01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:25.433
and after they spilled.

2008
01:13:25.567 --> 01:13:27.233
I thought there might
be a way to try and--

2009
01:13:27.367 --> 01:13:30.433
- I'm supposed to
protect my sources.

2010
01:13:30.567 --> 01:13:31.600
- Yeah.

2011
01:13:31.734 --> 01:13:34.100
- To advocate to these
people by getting the story.

2012
01:13:34.233 --> 01:13:36.100
You giving the bank a head's up

2013
01:13:36.233 --> 01:13:37.667
so they can sweep
it under the rug...

2014
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.033
- No. that's not
what happened here.

2015
01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:40.767
I went to them to try to fix it.

2016
01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.700
I asked them to fix it.

2017
01:13:42.834 --> 01:13:44.233
- They were never gonna fix it.

2018
01:13:44.367 --> 01:13:45.867
- They might!

2019
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.700
The people I know there.

2020
01:13:49.166 --> 01:13:51.533
I trusted them to
do the right thing.

2021
01:13:51.667 --> 01:13:54.400
- I should've trusted my gut.

2022
01:13:54.533 --> 01:13:55.567
- I knew that there was one way

2023
01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.533
that this was gonna end
if I came straight to you.

2024
01:13:57.667 --> 01:14:00.100
At least this way.
there's a chance

2025
01:14:00.233 --> 01:14:01.567
that everyone can have a--

2026
01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:02.600
- Happy ending?

2027
01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.700
I like that you always try to
find the good in everything.

2028
01:14:08.867 --> 01:14:09.767
I really do.

2029
01:14:11.767 --> 01:14:13.333
But that fantasy
is preventing you

2030
01:14:13.467 --> 01:14:15.100
from standing up
for what's right.

2031
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.333
And what's worse. is
you tried to fix it

2032
01:14:18.467 --> 01:14:21.166
without even coming to me.

2033
01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.433
You got me out. and
tried to swoop in

2034
01:14:24.567 --> 01:14:27.667
with some knight in
shining armor routine.

2035
01:14:34.033 --> 01:14:36.667
You can't even be
honest with me?

2036
01:14:38.567 --> 01:14:40.467
I'm sorry. but I can't do this.

2037
01:14:42.266 --> 01:14:45.266
(melancholic music)

2038
01:15:00.834 --> 01:15:01.734
- Tom.

2039
01:15:01.867 --> 01:15:02.767
- Hey. Glenn.

2040
01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:03.867
- I want to thank you.

2041
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.967
for your discretion
regarding that news story.

2042
01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:07.600
You're a real team player.

2043
01:15:07.734 --> 01:15:08.567
- Thank you. sir.

2044
01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.300
- You spared us a PR nightmare.

2045
01:15:10.433 --> 01:15:12.433
This kind of foresight is
exactly what we'd expect

2046
01:15:12.567 --> 01:15:14.367
out of a director.

2047
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.066
Something to think about
for the spring reviews.

2048
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:18.600
We like to reward
that kind of loyalty.

2049
01:15:18.734 --> 01:15:19.600
- Absolutely.

2050
01:15:19.734 --> 01:15:20.767
Thank you. sir.

2051
01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:22.100
Hey. Glenn.

2052
01:15:22.233 --> 01:15:23.734
Out of curiosity.
what happens next?

2053
01:15:23.867 --> 01:15:26.533
- Well. Paul and Al will
do some seminars with HR.

2054
01:15:26.667 --> 01:15:28.767
and our communications team
is drafting a statement.

2055
01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.633
so that should
nip it in the bud.

2056
01:15:30.767 --> 01:15:31.567
- Most of those names
that I gave though.

2057
01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.066
they weren't Paul
and Al's clients.

2058
01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.300
and those were just the
ones that we knew about.

2059
01:15:37.233 --> 01:15:39.533
So. I mean. shouldn't
there be some kind of

2060
01:15:39.667 --> 01:15:40.700
investigation or--

2061
01:15:40.834 --> 01:15:42.600
- Tom. you're a good guy.

2062
01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.734
You've done great work for us.

2063
01:15:44.867 --> 01:15:46.066
you've proven your loyalty.

2064
01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.467
and you're on track
for a big promotion.

2065
01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.700
I'd just stay in your lane.

2066
01:15:49.834 --> 01:15:50.600
Keep your eye on
the prize. okay?

2067
01:15:50.734 --> 01:15:51.767
We'll handle it.

2068
01:15:58.333 --> 01:15:59.800
- And if you could
forward me the links

2069
01:15:59.934 --> 01:16:01.567
for the interviews.
that would...

2070
01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:04.967
Be great. thanks.

2071
01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.333
Hey.

2072
01:16:09.467 --> 01:16:10.767
I told you. we can't.

2073
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.367
- I didn't come here for us.

2074
01:16:13.633 --> 01:16:16.066
I just wanted you to know that
I quit my job this morning.

2075
01:16:17.667 --> 01:16:20.000
If you need someone
to go on record.

2076
01:16:20.133 --> 01:16:21.333
I'm willing to do that.

2077
01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.533
- I didn't ask you
to do that for me.

2078
01:16:24.667 --> 01:16:25.467
- I know.

2079
01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.834
It's the right thing to do.

2080
01:16:27.967 --> 01:16:30.800
(lighthearted music)

2081
01:16:33.967 --> 01:16:35.000
- Okay.

2082
01:16:35.734 --> 01:16:38.300
Let's get you
ready for pre-tape.

2083
01:16:38.433 --> 01:16:39.200
Come on.

2084
01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:44.867
Stand by. queue.

2085
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
- Queue standing by.

2086
01:16:47.734 --> 01:16:48.633
- Rolling.

2087
01:16:48.767 --> 01:16:49.533
- [Man] Here we go.

2088
01:16:49.667 --> 01:16:51.100
- Good morning. Milwaukee.

2089
01:16:51.233 --> 01:16:53.633
Today we start with
a special report.

2090
01:16:53.767 --> 01:16:56.700
fraud. at Imperium
National Bank.

2091
01:16:56.834 --> 01:16:58.266
I'm joined today
by a former member

2092
01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.734
of the Imperium National
Bank marketing team.

2093
01:17:00.867 --> 01:17:02.000
Tom Malone.

2094
01:17:02.133 --> 01:17:02.867
Good morning. Tom.

2095
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:03.667
- Good morning.

2096
01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.066
Thank you for having me. River.

2097
01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.400
I wish it were under
better circumstances.

2098
01:17:06.533 --> 01:17:08.367
- Tom. how widespread is this?

2099
01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.533
Is it happening at other banks?

2100
01:17:10.667 --> 01:17:11.767
- Well. without a
proper investigation

2101
01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:14.333
there's no way of saying how
widespread the practice is.

2102
01:17:14.467 --> 01:17:16.166
- The biggest question
coming out of this

2103
01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.567
is how could this have happened

2104
01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.400
at such a respected institution?

2105
01:17:20.333 --> 01:17:21.100
- Right.

2106
01:17:22.667 --> 01:17:25.033
Our costumers trusted us.
and we broke that trust.

2107
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:27.533
Every sales culture
is competitive.

2108
01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:29.934
but when there's
unreasonable expectations.

2109
01:17:30.066 --> 01:17:33.433
that can cause people to
operate from desperation.

2110
01:17:34.867 --> 01:17:37.467
I hope Imperium sees
this as an opportunity

2111
01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:42.600
to both reflect. and to do
what's right for its customers.

2112
01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:44.734
- It's officially gone viral.

2113
01:17:44.867 --> 01:17:46.567
- Breaking from Milwaukee today.

2114
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.066
the fraudulent practices

2115
01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.600
of local Imperium
National Bank salespeople.

2116
01:17:50.734 --> 01:17:52.567
- Cracked the case in
a nationwide scandal.

2117
01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:54.567
where a high pressured
sales culture

2118
01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:55.600
drove employees to--

2119
01:17:55.734 --> 01:17:57.734
- Create fake accounts
under customer names.

2120
01:17:57.867 --> 01:18:00.266
We go live to Imperium's
headquarters in New York

2121
01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:02.533
where Brian Vantana
is on the scene.

2122
01:18:02.667 --> 01:18:03.333
Brian.

2123
01:18:03.467 --> 01:18:04.500
- What did I tell you?

2124
01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:06.300
- Yes!

2125
01:18:20.767 --> 01:18:21.867
(knocking)

2126
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.400
- Oh. door's open!

2127
01:18:24.467 --> 01:18:27.834
- We got a call about a
complaint at this address?

2128
01:18:27.967 --> 01:18:30.533
- What happened in here?

2129
01:18:30.667 --> 01:18:34.667
- Tom sent the flowers.
and the board game.

2130
01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.500
Listen. I called this group hang

2131
01:18:36.633 --> 01:18:38.967
because I need to talk
to you about something.

2132
01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.166
- Oh. we've talked about it.

2133
01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:41.433
and we all unanimously agree

2134
01:18:41.567 --> 01:18:42.800
you should give
Tom another chance.

2135
01:18:42.934 --> 01:18:45.033
- No. that's not what
I want to talk about.

2136
01:18:45.166 --> 01:18:46.667
Wait. seriously?

2137
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.300
Unanimously?

2138
01:18:48.433 --> 01:18:50.300
- Yeah. and all your reasons
for being upset are valid.

2139
01:18:50.433 --> 01:18:51.367
- Totally.

2140
01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.200
But I think he was
coming from a good place.

2141
01:18:53.333 --> 01:18:54.834
I mean. misguided. but good.

2142
01:18:54.967 --> 01:18:56.133
Which counts for something.

2143
01:18:56.266 --> 01:18:58.600
- Plus. he ultimately
did the right thing.

2144
01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:01.333
- Plus. plus. you're so
happy when you're with him.

2145
01:19:01.467 --> 01:19:02.567
we just--

2146
01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:04.100
- But I can't get back
together with Tom.

2147
01:19:04.233 --> 01:19:05.367
- Wait. but--

2148
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.133
- Because I think I'm
moving to Chicago.

2149
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:09.567
- Oh!

2150
01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:12.266
- When the story went national.

2151
01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:15.767
they offered me a job
at Good Morning Chicago.

2152
01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:17.266
(laughing)

2153
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.667
- And what did you tell them?

2154
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.367
- I mean. I was
thinking of saying yes.

2155
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:22.200
(laughing)

2156
01:19:22.333 --> 01:19:23.400
- Yeah. yeah.

2157
01:19:23.533 --> 01:19:26.700
- But I don't know. now I'm
all in my head about Tom.

2158
01:19:26.834 --> 01:19:28.433
- Chicago's a two
hour drive away.

2159
01:19:28.567 --> 01:19:29.467
If you want to fix
things with Tom.

2160
01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.433
this move is not gonna
be the end of the world.

2161
01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:32.500
- Plus. there's a Six Flags

2162
01:19:32.633 --> 01:19:34.767
like right in the
mid-point of the. it's...

2163
01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.467
- I don't know.

2164
01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:40.934
My gut is screaming yes. but
my head is. I don't know.

2165
01:19:41.066 --> 01:19:42.567
what if I'm not ready?

2166
01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.767
What if my dream job actually
turns out to be a nightmare.

2167
01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:47.433
or what if--

2168
01:19:47.567 --> 01:19:49.600
- Hey. we have watched you put
yourself out there all month.

2169
01:19:49.734 --> 01:19:51.400
and you have flourished.

2170
01:19:51.533 --> 01:19:53.600
You're doing that storytelling
competition tomorrow.

2171
01:19:53.734 --> 01:19:56.533
you broke a national news story.

2172
01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:57.734
You fell in love.

2173
01:19:58.767 --> 01:20:00.600
All those things sounded
terrifying at Christmas.

2174
01:20:00.734 --> 01:20:03.767
and yeah. some of them came
with really hard bumps.

2175
01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.300
Would you change any of it?

2176
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.033
- So. here's what
we're gonna do.

2177
01:20:10.166 --> 01:20:12.867
Jackson's gonna go buy some
boxes and packing tape.

2178
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.433
I'm gonna get that pizza.

2179
01:20:14.567 --> 01:20:15.467
while you run through

2180
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.033
tomorrow night's
storytelling piece for us.

2181
01:20:19.166 --> 01:20:22.700
But first. you're going to
call Good Morning Chicago

2182
01:20:22.834 --> 01:20:25.934
and tell them that today
is their lucky day.

2183
01:20:26.066 --> 01:20:27.567
- I'm glad you
guys feel that way.

2184
01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.667
because I called them this
afternoon and said yes.

2185
01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:33.100
- She's going to Chicago!

2186
01:20:33.233 --> 01:20:34.633
- We're going to Six Flags!

2187
01:20:35.633 --> 01:20:36.734
- Group hug!

2188
01:20:36.867 --> 01:20:38.166
(laughing)

2189
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.400
(lighthearted music)

2190
01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:45.266
- The truth is. I
was hiding behind no.

2191
01:20:46.266 --> 01:20:49.000
It was safe in a bubble
of what was familiar.

2192
01:20:49.133 --> 01:20:51.066
and easy to tell
myself I was doing well

2193
01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.934
when I was risking so little.

2194
01:20:54.867 --> 01:20:58.333
But my friends showed me
that by playing it small.

2195
01:20:58.467 --> 01:21:00.700
I was only leaving
space for fear.

2196
01:21:01.767 --> 01:21:06.600
So. when I fell in love
with Tobias. let's call him.

2197
01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.767
I realized I was only
vividly imagining

2198
01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.000
all the ways things
could go wrong.

2199
01:21:14.133 --> 01:21:16.166
and not open to all
the exciting things

2200
01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:17.767
that could go right.

2201
01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:21.000
Possibilities I hadn't
even thought of.

2202
01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.500
I've done a lot of
things this past month

2203
01:21:25.633 --> 01:21:26.700
that have challenged me.

2204
01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:30.633
but falling in love...

2205
01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.133
I wouldn't change
a thing about it.

2206
01:21:36.266 --> 01:21:37.567
(clapping)

2207
01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.700
(laughing)

2208
01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.400
- All right. that
was Kelly Leone.

2209
01:21:43.533 --> 01:21:44.734
Absolutely fantastic.

2210
01:21:44.867 --> 01:21:47.333
And now. let's give
a warm Story Slam...

2211
01:21:47.467 --> 01:21:48.233
Yeah. yeah. sure.

2212
01:21:48.367 --> 01:21:49.233
- Thank you.

2213
01:21:49.367 --> 01:21:50.333
Hi there. everybody.

2214
01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.734
I'm Tobias.

2215
01:21:54.867 --> 01:21:56.400
(lighthearted music)

2216
01:21:56.533 --> 01:21:57.967
(laughing)

2217
01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:00.667
So. Kelly's favorite book
when she was growing up

2218
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.800
was "The Velveteen Rabbit".

2219
01:22:02.934 --> 01:22:04.367
Now. there's this
part in the story

2220
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.800
where the character of
the Skin Horse explains

2221
01:22:06.934 --> 01:22:09.233
how you become real.

2222
01:22:09.367 --> 01:22:11.166
And he says. "By the
time you're real.

2223
01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.000
"most of your hair
has been loved off.

2224
01:22:13.133 --> 01:22:17.367
"your eyes drop out. but
none of that matters at all.

2225
01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:21.133
"because once you're
real. you can't be ugly.

2226
01:22:21.266 --> 01:22:24.233
"except to people who
don't understand."

2227
01:22:24.367 --> 01:22:26.166
Before I met Kelly.
I was running around.

2228
01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:29.300
I was pleasing everyone.

2229
01:22:29.433 --> 01:22:31.900
and never really
letting them know me.

2230
01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:35.767
Kelly is the most authentic
person I've ever met.

2231
01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.734
She made me real.

2232
01:22:38.867 --> 01:22:40.400
She made me check
in with my gut.

2233
01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.533
and now that I'm being
honest with myself.

2234
01:22:44.667 --> 01:22:46.834
I decided to finally
chase my childhood dream.

2235
01:22:46.967 --> 01:22:48.800
and I accepted a job in Chicago.

2236
01:22:48.934 --> 01:22:51.400
which I know. it
sounds weird right now.

2237
01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:52.834
but I promise you. I had no idea

2238
01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:54.834
you were going there. I promise.

2239
01:22:54.967 --> 01:22:57.900
Anyway. I just wanted
to say thank you.

2240
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:01.400
And I wanted to
let you know that

2241
01:23:01.533 --> 01:23:05.367
I'm never gonna hide myself
ever again. because of you.

2242
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.500
(lighthearted music)

2243
01:23:23.333 --> 01:23:24.934
(chuckling)

2244
01:23:25.066 --> 01:23:25.834
- Yeah.

2245
01:23:29.734 --> 01:23:31.934
- I'll see you in Chicago?

2246
01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:34.467
- Yes.

2247
01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.467
(chuckling)

2248
01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.667
(lighthearted music)

2249
01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.567
(lighthearted outro music)
