3
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.729
Let's see. Hmm.

4
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.149
Nutmeg. seeds…

5
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:53.947
Mom. do we have any cochineal beetles.
or alligator peppers. or fennel seeds?

6
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.156
You need those for homework?

7
00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.158
Let's go. Let's go.

8
00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:58.827
I'll be back.

9
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:07.001
Yes. I agree.
Imagination is very important.

10
00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.586
Remind me about the frog.

11
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.297
It was dead whenever we found it.
but it didn't die in vain.

12
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:14.467
It will be an important ingredient
in a meaningful plan.

13
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.345
You are an important ingredient
in a meaningful plan.

14
00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:22.016
No. not you.
You're just a grad student. Ugh!

15
00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:27.814
Does this sound okay?
"Our uberous Principal."

16
00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:30.316
That sounds wonderful. honey. Keep going.

17
00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:34.070
"It is my honor to welcome to the stage…"

18
00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:36.489
Or should it be "privilege"?

19
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.492
It's my privilege to welcome to the stage…

20
00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:41.119
No.

21
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:42.912
-My prerogative?

22
00:02:42.996 --> 00:02:44.372
Bean! Watch it!

23
00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:45.456
Gotta go!

24
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.626
Bean!
Well. at least have some toast.

25
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.462
I can put some butter
and your favorite strawberry jam on it.

26
00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.923
-Bean. don't forget your lunch.
-Oh. Um…

27
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.051
-Bean. Lunch.
-I'm dropping Nancy off on my way to work.

28
00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:59.095
-I can take you too!
-Can't be late!

29
00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:01.681
Leo. hurry up.

30
00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.975
Hi. Ivy.

31
00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:07.020
-Hey. Ivy. don't be late for school.

32
00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.480
If you were homeschooled.
you'd be there by now.

33
00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:10.565
Hello. Mrs. Trantz.

34
00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:12.817
-Look away. Dottsy. Look away.

35
00:03:18.406 --> 00:03:19.532
-Hi. Ivy!
-Hi. Bean!

36
00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:22.869
We gotta go!

37
00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:26.080
I've something to ask Ms. Aruba-Tate.
and she won't let us if we're late.

38
00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.793
Bye. Ivy!

39
00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.713
-Bean. you're still in your pajamas!

40
00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:35.340
What's that sound. Dottsy?

41
00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:36.633
Little girls!

42
00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.641
-Two minutes till bell.

43
00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:45.725
Bean!

44
00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.982
Have a great day. you two.

45
00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.984
And try to grow up.

46
00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.694
-Nancy.

47
00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.404
Why did you throw her pants at her?

48
00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:00.281
-Couldn't you hand it to her?
-She's far away.

49
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.242
-Be nicer.
-That was me being nice.

50
00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.993
Nice people don't throw pants.

51
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:05.954
-Quick! Follow me.

52
00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:09.749
Don't wait. I'll catch up.

53
00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.793
Are you sure you can go in there?

54
00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.878
-Hmm…

55
00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.255
Yep. It opens.

56
00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.591
-Okay. fine.

57
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.636
Hmm…

58
00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:44.409
Ivy…

59
00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.326
Bean?

60
00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:55.295
-Do you feel anything unusual?

61
00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:58.881
My pajama bottoms
are kind of scrunching under these pants.

62
00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:07.932
We can't be late. Ivy.

63
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:11.853
Especially not today because I have to ask
if we can sit together.

64
00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:18.484
Hey. Vanessa.

65
00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.320
I am a robot.

66
00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:23.072
I have no use for vegetables.

67
00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.214
Second bell. Take your seats. everyone.

68
00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.507
Lots to do today.

69
00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:44.469
You made it. Bean. Well done.

70
00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:46.971
Because Ivy helped me. Ms. Aruba-Tate.

71
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:50.183
And Ivy. me-- I mean. uh… Uh. Ivy and I.

72
00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:53.269
Excuse me. Bean. Dusit. head out
of the wastebasket. please.

73
00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.979
Powering down.

74
00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.857
Eric. please put those paper wads
in the wastebasket.

75
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:01.486
Okay. my intrepid learners.

76
00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.404
-Paint brush.
-Pencils ready.

77
00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.031
We have a fun class today.

78
00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:07.408
Ivy and I--

79
00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.786
We wondered
if we could sit together today.

80
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.704
Hmm.

81
00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.956
I think you two would make a great team.

82
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.876
But if there's talking.
I'm gonna have to separate you.

83
00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.503
I promise I'll be quiet.

84
00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.254
-All right. We'll give it a try.
-Yes! Yay!

85
00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:22.715
-Thank you!
-You're the best. Ms. Aruba-Tate!

86
00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:24.592
Leo. please go sit next to Eric.

87
00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:26.969
-Yes.
-Since when are they friends?

88
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.806
"You two would make a great team."

89
00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.265
-Zip it. Dusit.
-Bean?

90
00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.184
-Didn't you just make a promise?

91
00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:37.688
And. Dusit.
we're settling down now. correct?

92
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:40.483
Did everyone remember
to bring their notebooks?

93
00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:44.195
We've been talking
about prehistoric marine reptiles.

94
00:06:44.278 --> 00:06:46.364
Who remembers the name of this guy?

95
00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:49.867
It's a Bean-o-saur! Run for your life!

96
00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.828
Dusit. that's twice.

97
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.997
You need some rug time.
and you may rejoin us in five minutes.

98
00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.005
Elasmosaurus!

99
00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.882
Yes. Good job. everyone.

100
00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:06.217
And the Elasmosaurus is?

101
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.385
Extinct!

102
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.314
You look late.

103
00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.649
Do you feel late?

104
00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:24.068
-Detention.

105
00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:27.864
Those bows are outlandish.
and they're overpowering your person.

106
00:07:27.947 --> 00:07:32.076
You know my motto.
"Sacrifice for success."

107
00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:36.831
Those are far too loud.
Dress code violation!

108
00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:38.666
Noise code violation!

109
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:40.793
I'll see you after school.

110
00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:54.932
Good morning. Ms. Aruba-Tate.

111
00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.100
Good morning.

112
00:07:56.184 --> 00:07:58.186
Good morning. class.

113
00:07:58.686 --> 00:08:02.398
Good morning. Principal Noble!

114
00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:03.816
We'll see about that.

115
00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:08.946
Our middle school student council
president will be distributing flyers

116
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.657
for the upcoming curriculum night.

117
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.993
-It will be a night to remember.

118
00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:17.121
-Hmm.
-We sincerely hope you all will attend.

119
00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:20.666
Huh. As if.

120
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.461
As the new school year gets underway.

121
00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:28.466
curriculum night is a nonpareil.
pedagogic opportunity

122
00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:31.260
-to learn what our expectations are…
-Pedagogic.

123
00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.931
…grade by grade. as well as
the means for assessing…

124
00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.307
Help me!

125
00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:38.142
…your progress.

126
00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:40.811
-What are you doing?
-Checking to see

127
00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.980
if there's any secret notes
from prisoners.

128
00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:46.442
Mrs. Noble keeps all the bad kids
locked up in her closet.

129
00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.319
These are x-ray.

130
00:08:48.402 --> 00:08:50.154
-You two!

131
00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.781
You're entirely too chatty.

132
00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:58.996
Ivy. I need you to switch places
and go sit next to Paisley. please.

133
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.040
Bean. that's twice. honey.

134
00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:03.334
-Five minutes on the Timeout Rug.
-Okay.

135
00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:06.671
Thank you.

136
00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.807
Come. Nancy.

137
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.685
Curriculum night waits for no one!

138
00:09:22.186 --> 00:09:23.563
Busted.

139
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.108
All right.

140
00:09:28.025 --> 00:09:29.485
Let's talk about dinosaurs.

141
00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:31.404
One.

142
00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:33.114
Two.

143
00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.283
-Three.
-One.

144
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.118
-Two.
-Four.

145
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:38.995
-Three.
-Four. Five.

146
00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:39.996
Four.

147
00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.582
-Ivy. I did four.
-And I did five!

148
00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.376
-What about you. Vanessa?
-I did six and a half.

149
00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:47.712
I've never got in trouble
at school before.

150
00:09:47.795 --> 00:09:49.714
-Dad says trouble's my middle name.
-11.

151
00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:51.632
Look. 12!

152
00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.303
-Yay. Zuzu!
-Twelve in a row. Record.

153
00:09:55.386 --> 00:09:57.263
Ivy. how many can you do?

154
00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:59.473
You have to do something.
You can't just sit there.

155
00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.727
Want to see me do a cartwheel again?

156
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.729
No. it's Ivy's turn.

157
00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.441
How about three cartwheels and a roundoff?

158
00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:26.584
What the heck is that?

159
00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:34.842
-I knew it. Forget cartwheels.

160
00:10:34.925 --> 00:10:36.969
We've got an emergency situation.

161
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:44.393
Ivy. that's just a vent.
Not an emergency situation.

162
00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.188
I'm talking about the white mist.
Don't you see it?

163
00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.565
-I sort of see it.

164
00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.108
No. nothing.

165
00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.985
Come on. Emma. You'll be late.

166
00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:56.947
-I think I saw something. Zuzu.
-No. you didn't.

167
00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:00.534
This morning when we went in there.

168
00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:03.537
I felt surrounded by cold mist.

169
00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:04.789
I heard a voice.

170
00:11:04.872 --> 00:11:07.500
and the hairs on my arm stood straight up.

171
00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.877
-Something was not right. Bean.

172
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.089
And then. we heard
that incredible tapping noise.

173
00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:18.803
Like. kids in Mrs. Noble's closet
signaling. "Help me. Help me."

174
00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:19.804
No.

175
00:11:19.887 --> 00:11:25.685
More like tick. tap. tick. tap. tick.

176
00:11:25.768 --> 00:11:27.061
It's a ghost.

177
00:11:27.144 --> 00:11:28.145
A ghost?

178
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.440
That bathroom is haunted.

179
00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:36.195
Second bell?

180
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:37.530
Run. Ivy!

181
00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.518
Paisley. pass this to Bean.

182
00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:09.812
Psst.

183
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.904
Eric.

184
00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:25.786
-Oh. Eric. honey.
Sorry. Miss.

185
00:12:32.626 --> 00:12:33.627
Leo.

186
00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:05.409
Excuse me. Ms. Aruba-Tate?
May I be excused to the bathroom?

187
00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.870
Of course. Ten more minutes. everyone.

188
00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.747
Let's see if we can finish our chapters.

189
00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.918
May I be excused to the bathroom?

190
00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:15.044
Absolutely.

191
00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:16.962
As soon as Ivy's back.

192
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.845
I would wait. Only. I can't.

193
00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:27.306
I have to go bad. Ms. Aruba-Tate.

194
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:29.850
Really bad! Really! Really!

195
00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.602
Code red! DEFCON 12!

196
00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:33.729
Whatever the highest one is!

197
00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:44.532
What are we looking for?

198
00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:46.367
A secret opening.

199
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.078
We need to find the portal
that the ghosts are using to get in.

200
00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.997
Ghosts? You mean more than one?

201
00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:01.090
These were made for finding secrets.

202
00:14:14.395 --> 00:14:15.646
Here.

203
00:14:20.025 --> 00:14:21.861
Ghost plasm.

204
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.406
-This is a ghost portal. Bean.
-Mmm.

205
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.245
I wonder what's down there.

206
00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:47.052
We come in peace. ghosts.

207
00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:49.263
Are you in there. ghosts?

208
00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:52.808
We mean you no harm.

209
00:15:07.281 --> 00:15:09.241
Terrible. But I suspected it.

210
00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:11.827
We built a bathroom on their heads.

211
00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:13.537
Are there a lot of them?

212
00:15:13.621 --> 00:15:14.663
There could be.

213
00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:17.333
It's possible there's an entire army
of them.

214
00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.501
-Or just one. We don't really know.

215
00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.170
-You! Get back…

216
00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.254
Hide!

217
00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:24.423
Stop right there!

218
00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.008
Get to class.

219
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:41.440
Wakey-wakey.
my cheeky little darlings.

220
00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:44.151
I knew it.
She has kids in there.

221
00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:49.156
Did we all sleep well
and snug last night?

222
00:15:53.827 --> 00:15:56.997
Hello. my lovelies.

223
00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.375
Shoes must be the secret
to her power.

224
00:15:59.875 --> 00:16:02.878
How I adore
the smell of leather.

225
00:16:02.962 --> 00:16:05.631
feathers. and sparkling rhinestones.

226
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:10.803
The secret of my style is my shoes.

227
00:16:11.428 --> 00:16:13.305
And the secret of my shoes

228
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.101
is that no one knows you're here

229
00:16:17.685 --> 00:16:23.148
in this fortress
of a closet safe from fire and flood.

230
00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:25.943
Our principal is weird.

231
00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:29.738
Which one of you
is the lucky one?

232
00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:30.656
Hmm?

233
00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:36.120
Winner. winner. chicken… dinner.

234
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.497
Oh.

235
00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:41.208
Oh.

236
00:16:43.335 --> 00:16:44.336
Mmm…

237
00:16:49.925 --> 00:16:51.468
A little snug.

238
00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:52.553
Mmm. Oh.

239
00:16:55.472 --> 00:16:57.016
Snugger still.

240
00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.752
Hello? Hello?

241
00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:42.561
Listen up. everyone.

242
00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:45.481
Ivy has some really important news.

243
00:17:53.989 --> 00:17:57.159
Earlier today.
Bean and I made an important discovery.

244
00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.789
The teacher's lavatory
contains a portal to the underworld.

245
00:18:02.372 --> 00:18:03.248
Huh?

246
00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:06.543
She means the bathroom is haunted.

247
00:18:08.128 --> 00:18:10.589
I've heard of that. It happens.

248
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.426
The school was built
on top of an old graveyard.

249
00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:16.386
A cemetery.

250
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.097
I don't believe you.

251
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.850
-Can we go see?
-You can. but it's an unstable situation.

252
00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:24.186
and we cannot guarantee your safety.

253
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.483
Did you know that ghosts
have their guts on the outside?

254
00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:32.778
And they eat brains raw.

255
00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:35.739
That's a zombie. Not a ghost.

256
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.117
It smells in here.

257
00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:41.120
Like… death.

258
00:18:41.995 --> 00:18:44.748
Just because it smells like death.
does not mean it's haunted.

259
00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:46.125
-Hmm.

260
00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:49.503
Shh!

261
00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:56.760
Behold. the portal.

262
00:18:56.844 --> 00:18:59.096
Gateway to the spirit world.

263
00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:02.307
Door to the unfathomable mysteries!

264
00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:03.642
Huh?

265
00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:04.893
"Unfapin"?

266
00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.520
-"Uhfathable?

267
00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:09.481
She means
this is how the ghosts are getting in.

268
00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:12.025
-Ooh.
-That's just a rusty drain.

269
00:19:13.068 --> 00:19:14.194
Are they mad?

270
00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:17.656
They've been forced to wander.
unsettled. miserable.

271
00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:20.993
seeking revenge on those who disturb them.

272
00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:22.286
Are they here now?

273
00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:24.121
I don't see any.

274
00:19:24.204 --> 00:19:26.248
You don't want to see them.

275
00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:28.208
Can we go now. Emma?

276
00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:36.341
I've gone to this school for three years.
and I've never seen a ghost.

277
00:19:36.967 --> 00:19:39.094
-There's no such thing.

278
00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:42.848
-Sometimes it's easier to feel the ghosts.

279
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:46.560
It's like a cold wind
passing right through you.

280
00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:50.272
-We've come to address your plight

281
00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:54.234
and ask you. as friends.
to not seek revenge on us.

282
00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:59.156
If you agree.
please knock just one short tap.

283
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.194
Well…

284
00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:41.657
Never seen you all so ready
to learn double-digit subtraction.

285
00:20:44.284 --> 00:20:46.745
You need to learn
how to do head count. Ms. Aruba-Tate.

286
00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:49.665
-I found this hiding in a bush.

287
00:20:50.707 --> 00:20:53.752
Thank you. Mrs. Noble.
We were just starting class.

288
00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:55.879
Ah. Hm.

289
00:20:58.257 --> 00:20:59.383
Hm.

290
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.806
Zuzu. what's the matter?

291
00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:07.641
Bathroom.

292
00:21:07.724 --> 00:21:10.227
-Okay. honey. What about the bathroom?

293
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.647
It's… It's… It's haunted.

294
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.191
-Zuzu. I can see that you're scared.

295
00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:19.319
But I'll tell you what.
the bathroom is definitely not haunted.

296
00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:20.237
It is!

297
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.655
We heard them.

298
00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:22.614
We felt them.

299
00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:23.782
There's a portal!

300
00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:25.242
The ghost army is clanking!

301
00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:26.451
There's an army?

302
00:21:27.744 --> 00:21:31.039
It sounds like someone
just told you a very scary story.

303
00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:34.251
Did someone tell you a scary story?

304
00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:36.753
She did!

305
00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:44.052
-Ivy?
-She said she saw a ghost in the bathroom.

306
00:21:44.136 --> 00:21:45.804
and it's mad
'cause the school's on graves.

307
00:21:45.887 --> 00:21:47.389
and they're gonna take revenge!

308
00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:49.808
Ivy. did you really say those things?

309
00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:51.935
Not exactly those words.

310
00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:56.106
Having an imagination is good.
and. Ivy. you have a powerful one.

311
00:21:56.857 --> 00:22:00.485
But we need to use our imaginations
responsibly and respectfully.

312
00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:03.113
We don't want to scare anybody. Do we?

313
00:22:03.613 --> 00:22:05.490
Yeah. Ivy. That was mean.

314
00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.994
Can we all agree that
there'll be no more talk about ghosts?

315
00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:12.456
Yes. Ms. Aruba-Tate.

316
00:22:16.543 --> 00:22:18.420
Ivy. do you agree. honey?

317
00:22:24.051 --> 00:22:26.303
No. The bathroom is haunted.

318
00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:45.530
Ms. Aruba-Tate is so mad. She hates me.

319
00:22:45.614 --> 00:22:48.367
No. she doesn't. She thinks you're smart.

320
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.953
Though maybe you should
have said the bathroom wasn't haunted.

321
00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:54.039
Grown-ups like when you agree with them.

322
00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:57.959
That's two times today
I got in trouble. Bean.

323
00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.419
Two times.

324
00:22:59.503 --> 00:23:01.671
I had to sit on the Timeout Rug.

325
00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:03.465
I think it might be my fault.

326
00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:07.886
You were supposed to rub off on me.
but I'm rubbing off on you.

327
00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:09.304
I'm always in trouble.

328
00:23:09.805 --> 00:23:13.225
If you don't want
to be my friend anymore. I understand.

329
00:23:13.308 --> 00:23:16.186
Are you kidding. Bean?
Nothing's fun without you.

330
00:23:27.823 --> 00:23:28.657
-Ha!

331
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.158
Zip it. Leo.

332
00:23:30.242 --> 00:23:32.285
I'm kidding.
I'm glad you didn't get expelled.

333
00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:34.579
We were never gonna get expelled.

334
00:23:35.205 --> 00:23:36.081
That's it.

335
00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:37.916
That's what we'll do.

336
00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:39.251
Get expelled?

337
00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:43.338
No. expel the ghosts.
Send them back to their graves.

338
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:46.174
Let's go. Bean. We need to make a plan.

339
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.343
An expelling plan.

340
00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:50.303
Wait!

341
00:23:51.304 --> 00:23:54.975
I wouldn't mind expelling a few ghosts.

342
00:23:55.642 --> 00:23:57.227
If you need some help.

343
00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.480
Okay. We'll tell you the plan tomorrow.

344
00:24:01.064 --> 00:24:03.108
Maybe.

345
00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:06.820
Don't tell anyone. okay?

346
00:24:06.903 --> 00:24:08.071
Bye. Leo!

347
00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:10.031
Maybe?

348
00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:15.495
"I'm presenting our luminous…"

349
00:24:15.579 --> 00:24:17.038
That means "shiny."

350
00:24:17.122 --> 00:24:19.749
Okay. "loquacious principal."

351
00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:24.004
Not only do I get to introduce Mrs. Noble.
she's asked me to read a closing poem.

352
00:24:24.087 --> 00:24:26.840
-I'm on stage the whole time.

353
00:24:26.923 --> 00:24:29.426
I'm gonna really need
to be on top of my adjectives.

354
00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:31.136
Yes. adjectives are important.

355
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:37.434
Go forth. oh.
erudite scholars of scholastic school.

356
00:24:37.517 --> 00:24:40.270
-This won't work.

357
00:24:40.353 --> 00:24:43.773
What won't?
It sounded quite… seventh grade.

358
00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:46.026
I don't look like a seventh-grader. Do I?

359
00:24:46.109 --> 00:24:49.488
Because seventh-graders
have pierced ears. and I do not.

360
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:53.617
Honey. I just want a little bit of you
to not grow up so fast.

361
00:24:54.659 --> 00:24:56.536
And I'm going with your earlobes for now.

362
00:24:58.747 --> 00:24:59.706
Tell you what. honey.

363
00:25:00.415 --> 00:25:03.084
I have some very nice clip-ons
you can borrow.

364
00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.085
Hmm.

365
00:25:04.794 --> 00:25:06.588
A truce move.

366
00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:08.173
Fine. Mom. For now.

367
00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:11.092
Now. being the next 48 hours.

368
00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:15.096
After that. we are back at it.

369
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.232
The clip-ons are in my jewelry box.

370
00:25:27.567 --> 00:25:28.693
Nutmeg.

371
00:25:30.153 --> 00:25:31.321
Seeds.

372
00:25:35.992 --> 00:25:37.786
Pinch of dead bugs.

373
00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:39.120
What about that frog?

374
00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:40.997
Saving that. It's in the fridge.

375
00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:45.544
It does require St. John's wort.

376
00:25:45.627 --> 00:25:48.338
St. John has warts?

377
00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:50.882
Those can't be easy to get.

378
00:25:50.966 --> 00:25:55.303
When I don't have stuff like that.
I just add extra baking soda.

379
00:26:05.313 --> 00:26:09.109
We just pour the potion down the portal.
and ghost be gone!

380
00:26:09.192 --> 00:26:11.820
Well. I feel kind of sorry for them.

381
00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:13.530
I'd hate to be a ghost.

382
00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:15.865
You'd have to sleep in your own grave.

383
00:26:30.297 --> 00:26:32.966
But you get to be invisible
and scare people.

384
00:26:36.886 --> 00:26:39.723
Woo!

385
00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:51.192
You know what we should do?

386
00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:54.738
Not just the potion.
but a whole ghost ceremony.

387
00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:56.531
-Like a goodbye party.
-Yes!

388
00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.908
Ghost loves ceremonies.

389
00:26:58.992 --> 00:27:00.368
-Uh-huh.
-We could say the spell.

390
00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:02.454
and do a song and dance around the portal.

391
00:27:02.537 --> 00:27:04.497
Good idea. What else do we need?

392
00:27:04.581 --> 00:27:06.708
The last ingredient is…

393
00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:08.501
Uh-oh.

394
00:27:09.252 --> 00:27:11.421
Hair of enemy cut at midnight.

395
00:27:11.504 --> 00:27:12.839
Where are we gonna get that?

396
00:27:12.922 --> 00:27:14.007
Hey. Bean-breath!

397
00:27:15.216 --> 00:27:17.677
Mom says
to get your moronic tushie-tush home

398
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:20.221
in ten minutes and set the table or else!

399
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.611
Okay. "lights out" means
no going downstairs.

400
00:27:34.694 --> 00:27:36.196
No endless drinks of water.

401
00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:38.406
No cartwheels on the bed.

402
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:42.952
No making x-ray glasses
while talking to the rubber chicken.

403
00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:46.498
Oh. and no questions about our existence.
You got it?

404
00:27:46.581 --> 00:27:49.376
I'll be asleep in a nanosecond. Dad.

405
00:27:51.294 --> 00:27:53.713
We learned about those in school.

406
00:27:53.797 --> 00:27:55.215
I'll believe it when I see it.

407
00:27:58.259 --> 00:27:59.511
Good night. Beanster.

408
00:28:11.564 --> 00:28:12.982
-Calling Wonder Witch.

409
00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:14.943
Calling Wonder Witch. Come in. Ivy.

410
00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:17.696
Go to sleep. Bean.

411
00:28:18.238 --> 00:28:19.197
I mean it.

412
00:28:25.453 --> 00:28:28.081
<i>Ivy here. 10-4.</i>
<i>What's your 20. Grizzly Girl?</i>

413
00:28:28.164 --> 00:28:31.751
Did you set your alarm
for Stay Up Late?

414
00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:34.337
Three alarms.
No way will I sleep through them.

415
00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:35.964
<i>-Copy that?</i>
-Affirmative.

416
00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:37.549
Ten-four. Alpha-Charlie.

417
00:28:37.632 --> 00:28:40.176
-Call me when you start.
-<i> Will do. Over and out.</i>

418
00:28:44.597 --> 00:28:46.599
Hmm.

419
00:30:23.446 --> 00:30:25.073
-How much hair should I cut?

420
00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:27.033
<i>A few hairs or a chunk of hair?</i>

421
00:30:27.116 --> 00:30:28.409
Hmm. Let's see.

422
00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:32.121
-The spell book says. "A lock of hair."
-How much is a lock?

423
00:30:32.205 --> 00:30:33.915
Um…

424
00:30:33.998 --> 00:30:36.125
Maybe just a little so she doesn't know.

425
00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:53.643
<i>It's me!</i>

426
00:31:00.066 --> 00:31:02.026
Bean! Bean! What's happening. Bean?

427
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.027
It's me. Bean!

428
00:31:03.111 --> 00:31:04.445
-What are you doing here?
-It's me!

429
00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:06.865
-What is going on?

430
00:31:06.948 --> 00:31:09.409
What on Earth are you doing. Bean?

431
00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:13.997
Uh… Nothing! I'm not doing anything!
I'm. uh… I'm sleepwalking!

432
00:31:15.206 --> 00:31:17.041
Call the police!

433
00:31:17.125 --> 00:31:20.295
She… She's a creepy crawler!
She touched my head!

434
00:31:21.087 --> 00:31:23.506
Bean. what are you doing?

435
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.091
<i>It's midnight!</i>

436
00:31:25.174 --> 00:31:28.219
I'm getting absconded.
and my ears aren't even pierced!

437
00:31:29.762 --> 00:31:32.265
Call the police! Call the police!

438
00:31:32.348 --> 00:31:35.226
We are not calling the police.

439
00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:40.148
Why is Bean wearing my bra?

440
00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.191
Um… Mm…

441
00:31:46.946 --> 00:31:47.947
You.

442
00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:50.658
Out now!

443
00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:53.328
-I can explain--
-Uh-uh! I don't wanna hear it.

444
00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.121
Let's go. Into your room.

445
00:31:55.204 --> 00:31:56.915
-I was trying to get a--
-And the bra?

446
00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.792
-Calm down.
-I turned over. and she was there.

447
00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:02.211
-She's wearing a mask and had scissors.
-I know.

448
00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:04.714
-Please. try to go back to sleep.
-Please. okay?

449
00:32:04.797 --> 00:32:07.800
And she… And how did she even get in?
I locked the door.

450
00:32:07.884 --> 00:32:11.137
-Okay. Okay. Yes. yes.
-I will fix the lock. I will fix the lock.

451
00:32:11.638 --> 00:32:13.181
I know what you're gonna say.

452
00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:15.141
Yes. I'll fix her lock too.

453
00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:16.476
Um…

454
00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:21.940
She was wearing a balaclava!

455
00:32:22.023 --> 00:32:23.566
-Oh. goodness.

456
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:24.943
Bean! Bean. are you there?

457
00:32:25.026 --> 00:32:27.612
The eagle has landed.

458
00:32:27.695 --> 00:32:30.031
The cat is in the bag.

459
00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:32.241
The peanut butter has met the jelly.

460
00:32:32.325 --> 00:32:34.661
What? Have you been captured?

461
00:32:35.244 --> 00:32:38.164
I have the hair.

462
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:46.965
Whoa.

463
00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:48.800
Whoa.

464
00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:51.344
-Nutmeg. seeds.

465
00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:54.430
So. okay. Good.

466
00:32:54.514 --> 00:32:59.268
"Hair of enemy. Circle of friends anoint
the portal in the darkness of night."

467
00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:01.729
Wait!

468
00:33:03.314 --> 00:33:05.108
I didn't see this part here before.

469
00:33:05.191 --> 00:33:07.527
It says that we have to deliver the potion
in darkness.

470
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.278
-I'll go turn the lights off.
-Of night!

471
00:33:10.446 --> 00:33:11.823
In the darkness of night.

472
00:33:11.906 --> 00:33:13.449
We can't get in here at night.

473
00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:16.285
They lock it up
with a guard and everything.

474
00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:19.080
Can't we just dump it in now
and see what happens?

475
00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:21.416
Leo. this is like science.

476
00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:25.086
We need to be precise or else
it could be an even bigger disaster.

477
00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:28.256
We have to explore
other expelling options.

478
00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:29.382
Do some research.

479
00:33:29.465 --> 00:33:30.466
Research?

480
00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:33.261
-Where are we gonna do that?

481
00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:38.558
Is this about the ghosts?

482
00:33:39.058 --> 00:33:41.894
Don't worry.
I promise I won't tell anyone.

483
00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:43.813
-Can I join you?
-Mmm.

484
00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:45.606
I want to help the ghost too.

485
00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:01.956
Oh. hello. Bean.
And hello and hello.

486
00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.875
-What are you up to?
-Research.

487
00:34:03.958 --> 00:34:04.917
Oh.

488
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:07.253
-Are you all deep in research too?
-Mm-hmm.

489
00:34:07.336 --> 00:34:10.965
I am. Ivy's rubbing off on me.
I mean in a good way.

490
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:14.844
Well. I think you're rubbing off
on her too. in a very good way.

491
00:34:15.636 --> 00:34:17.555
Uh. one quick question. Ivy.

492
00:34:17.638 --> 00:34:20.558
This flyer you brought home
says it's curriculum night tonight?

493
00:34:20.641 --> 00:34:22.018
Is that something you wanna do?

494
00:34:22.602 --> 00:34:23.895
Curriculum night?

495
00:34:25.271 --> 00:34:26.105
Night.

496
00:34:26.189 --> 00:34:28.483
Darkness. We're on again.

497
00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:30.777
Yes. It's time to do some expelling.

498
00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.987
Go ask your parents.
Get everything you need.

499
00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:35.364
The book says
it has to be something meaningful.

500
00:34:35.448 --> 00:34:36.949
Just make sure you're there.

501
00:34:38.117 --> 00:34:39.202
Bye!

502
00:34:39.786 --> 00:34:40.703
Bye!

503
00:34:40.787 --> 00:34:42.080
Leo. wait for me.

504
00:34:42.163 --> 00:34:45.041
Well. okay then.
Great. Looks like we're going.

505
00:34:45.124 --> 00:34:47.293
Seems to be surprisingly popular.

506
00:34:58.179 --> 00:34:59.889
Where is Bean off to?

507
00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:04.310
You can bet
she's up to something nefarious.

508
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.854
Or abominable. Or even…

509
00:35:09.148 --> 00:35:10.274
Flagitious.

510
00:35:10.358 --> 00:35:12.401
You're going to do great tonight. honey.

511
00:35:12.485 --> 00:35:15.154
How about I hold on to this thesaurus?

512
00:35:16.072 --> 00:35:18.366
-No.
-Let it go. sweetheart. Let it go.

513
00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:19.784
You're gonna be great.

514
00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:20.743
Come on.

515
00:35:23.538 --> 00:35:25.248
-I brought a chocolate bar.
-Cool.

516
00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:29.877
Eric? Dusit? What?

517
00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:32.922
Emma told me everything. and she made me
promise I wouldn't tell anyone.

518
00:35:33.005 --> 00:35:36.175
-Uh-huh.
-Except I told Dusit.

519
00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:38.302
-But Leo already told him.

520
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:40.972
Mm. Did everyone bring
what they're supposed to bring?

521
00:35:41.055 --> 00:35:42.056
Mm-hmm.

522
00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.017
Hey. what are you all up to?

523
00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:48.896
You must be desperate
if it requires hanging around with Bean.

524
00:35:52.024 --> 00:35:54.068
Did something happen to your hair?

525
00:35:54.152 --> 00:35:56.779
It looks… shorter on one side.

526
00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:08.040
We'll meet up in the bathroom
as soon as the lights go down.

527
00:36:08.124 --> 00:36:10.042
Don't let anyone see you.

528
00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:11.460
Mm-hmm.

529
00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:37.111
Hmm.

530
00:36:40.072 --> 00:36:44.410
Good evening.
or should I say copacetic evening.

531
00:36:45.494 --> 00:36:48.206
-Mom. can I go to the bathroom?
-Not now.

532
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:52.126
As student council president
of Emerson Elliott School.

533
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:55.296
a combined elementary
and middle grades institution…

534
00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:58.966
-Mom. I have to go!
-I thought you wanted to see Nancy?

535
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.426
…to Curriculum Night!

536
00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:16.067
Mom!

537
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:17.860
Not now. Not now.

538
00:37:17.944 --> 00:37:21.322
…without the perspicacious teachers
of Emerson Elliot School.

539
00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:25.034
So let us give them all
a round of assiduous applause.

540
00:37:25.117 --> 00:37:27.370
-"Assiduous." I gave her that one.

541
00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:35.753
Nancy would not stop talking.

542
00:37:37.964 --> 00:37:39.257
Are you ready?

543
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.383
-Yep.
-Yes.

544
00:37:50.726 --> 00:37:53.479
You look awesome.

545
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.066
Thank you.

546
00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:04.282
Before we begin. let us gather and share
our Earthly offerings.

547
00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:07.535
We shall each make a sacrifice
to the spirits.

548
00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:10.329
A gift of something deeply meaningful.

549
00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:11.914
Hmm.

550
00:38:22.341 --> 00:38:23.217
Hmm.

551
00:38:46.324 --> 00:38:47.533
Are you sure?

552
00:38:48.617 --> 00:38:51.078
Its ghost can live
with these ghosts for a pet.

553
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.001
Ooh! Actually. I don't know
if you wanna do that.

554
00:38:57.084 --> 00:38:59.420
How else are we gonna get them
underground?

555
00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:02.673
Oh. ghosts accept these
as our humble gifts!

556
00:39:09.055 --> 00:39:11.891
The classroom is a special environment.

557
00:39:11.974 --> 00:39:16.103
and we learn just as much from your
amazing kids as they learn from us.

558
00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:20.107
For myself and my fellow teachers.
it's a very sweet deal.

559
00:39:20.816 --> 00:39:21.650
Thank you.

560
00:39:27.114 --> 00:39:28.866
Thank you. Ms. Aruba-Tate.

561
00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:33.746
I am privileged to welcome
to the stage. Principal Noble.

562
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:37.208
Our scrupulous. efficacious.
and might I say.

563
00:39:37.291 --> 00:39:39.543
because of her very well-dressed feet…

564
00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:42.755
famously pedestrian leader.

565
00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:58.396
Well. thank you very much.
Ms. Aruba-Tate for those musings.

566
00:39:58.479 --> 00:39:59.397
-And now…

567
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.149
the moment you've all been waiting for.

568
00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:04.819
We will now commence
a ghost expelling spell.

569
00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:06.987
If you'll focus with me on the portal.

570
00:40:09.156 --> 00:40:10.241
Mm-hmm.

571
00:40:16.288 --> 00:40:18.332
Good. We are ready to begin.

572
00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:20.960
Oh. ghost of Emerson Elliott School.

573
00:40:21.043 --> 00:40:22.378
-I knew it.

574
00:40:22.461 --> 00:40:25.756
You're talking about those stupid.
made-up ghosts again.

575
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.093
We're not talking about them. Zuzu.
We're getting rid of them.

576
00:40:29.176 --> 00:40:32.430
Mm-hmm.
We're sending them back to their graves

577
00:40:32.513 --> 00:40:33.973
so they won't keep scaring people.

578
00:40:34.056 --> 00:40:35.641
It's okay. really.

579
00:40:44.525 --> 00:40:47.153
Oh. ghosts. who dwell in darkness.

580
00:40:47.236 --> 00:40:50.281
We came with gifts.
You must depart in peace!

581
00:40:54.743 --> 00:40:56.162
Whoa.

582
00:40:56.245 --> 00:40:59.915
Next. we will recite the sacred spell
and dance in a circle.

583
00:41:03.544 --> 00:41:05.045
Repeat after me.

584
00:41:06.046 --> 00:41:09.133
Begone. oh. ghost.
You are not welcome here.

585
00:41:09.216 --> 00:41:13.012
Begone. oh. ghost!
You are not welcome here!

586
00:41:13.095 --> 00:41:15.890
Haunt us no more! It's time to disappear!

587
00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:20.686
Haunt us no more!
It's time to disappear!

588
00:41:26.233 --> 00:41:28.402
Education is like evolution.

589
00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:31.447
Fall behind. and you perish.

590
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:34.325
My goal at Emerson Elliott School…

591
00:41:34.408 --> 00:41:36.660
Do you think I should go check on them?

592
00:41:36.744 --> 00:41:40.372
Oh. no. I trust Ivy.
and Bean is nothing but wonderful.

593
00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:44.210
Probably just knew how excruciating
this principal's presentation was gonna be

594
00:41:44.293 --> 00:41:46.795
and they snuck off
to do some research in the library.

595
00:41:46.879 --> 00:41:48.005
Hmm.

596
00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:57.306
Oh. I like that idea.

597
00:41:57.389 --> 00:42:01.519
But in my experience.
if everything is quiet. you need to worry.

598
00:42:01.602 --> 00:42:04.146
…we'll be making certain that they do…

599
00:42:10.778 --> 00:42:12.488
It still smells pretty bad.

600
00:42:12.571 --> 00:42:14.114
Did the spell work?

601
00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:16.283
Well. my feet are wet.

602
00:42:21.497 --> 00:42:25.000
Yes. Flow forth. Leave us forever!

603
00:42:25.084 --> 00:42:27.294
You are expelled!

604
00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:38.222
The ghosts are coming out of the toilet!

605
00:42:38.305 --> 00:42:39.807
Go. ghosts. go!

606
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:41.809
Boy are they making a mess.

607
00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:46.230
Success requires sacrifice on all levels.

608
00:42:46.313 --> 00:42:52.945
In fact. I have identified 27 distinct
and crucial learning loops called

609
00:42:53.028 --> 00:42:55.948
Sacrifice for Success.

610
00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:57.157
Let us begin.

611
00:42:57.783 --> 00:42:59.910
-The first learning loop…

612
00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:01.620
Self-discipline.

613
00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:04.873
Oh!

614
00:43:05.958 --> 00:43:07.835
I'll go check the closet
for supplies!

615
00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:09.003
Hurry. Eric!

616
00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:10.170
I am hurrying.

617
00:43:11.714 --> 00:43:13.007
Hurry up. guys.

618
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.758
We're gonna be in so much trouble!

619
00:43:14.842 --> 00:43:16.885
So much trouble.

620
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:18.304
Persistence.

621
00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:22.182
-Guys. come on.

622
00:43:22.891 --> 00:43:24.643
Who would put shoes in here?

623
00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:26.103
Just keep looking.

624
00:43:26.812 --> 00:43:27.646
Come on!

625
00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:31.775
Repetition.

626
00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:33.193
-Hurry!

627
00:43:33.777 --> 00:43:36.196
Hurry up. Bean! We need more paper!

628
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.656
Hard work.

629
00:43:41.577 --> 00:43:43.329
The ghosts are still coming out!

630
00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:46.040
Stop it! Stop it!

631
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:48.500
Don't just stand there. Zuzu.

632
00:43:48.584 --> 00:43:50.002
Pragmatism.

633
00:43:50.919 --> 00:43:53.380
All I see here is a plumbing issue.

634
00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:55.382
Problem-solving skills.

635
00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:57.384
I'll try and stop the pipes.

636
00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:58.969
-Okay. Bean!
-Hurry!

637
00:44:01.722 --> 00:44:02.806
Stay focused.

638
00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:07.853
Reward.

639
00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:14.485
I think I made it worse!

640
00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:17.780
Teamwork is the ninth learning loop.

641
00:44:17.863 --> 00:44:19.657
-A skill which requires

642
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.868
continuously disciplined behavior.

643
00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:27.289
And I think that you will find
that our students are first and foremost

644
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:30.334
well-trained in self-control.

645
00:44:34.713 --> 00:44:36.423
I didn't bring a rain jacket!

646
00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.467
-We need to build a wall!

647
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:40.386
My socks are all squishy!

648
00:44:44.973 --> 00:44:46.642
Well. if you'll excuse me
for just a moment.

649
00:44:46.725 --> 00:44:49.186
it seems I am required elsewhere.

650
00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:50.938
-What's going on?

651
00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:53.440
-This is weird.
-Nancy. Poem. Now! Go!

652
00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:54.733
Where is she going?

653
00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:03.617
While we wait for Mrs. Noble.

654
00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:07.037
I will read the poem that I was asked
to write as a closing poem.

655
00:45:07.121 --> 00:45:10.833
Though I think it'll work just as well
as a middle-of-the-program poem.

656
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:16.463
"Go forth into the world.
oh scholars of school."

657
00:45:17.548 --> 00:45:20.801
"Life is a banquet. Don't be a fool."

658
00:45:20.884 --> 00:45:23.137
-Help us. Vanessa!

659
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.389
"Learn all that you can."

660
00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:28.142
"Make every right choice."

661
00:45:33.439 --> 00:45:38.402
"You'll fill the arena
when you use your voice!"

662
00:45:40.779 --> 00:45:42.823
-What is going on?

663
00:45:57.463 --> 00:45:58.547
-Bean.
-Bean.

664
00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.507
-No.

665
00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.765
Oh. my babies!

666
00:46:08.348 --> 00:46:10.350
Oh. my sweet darlings.

667
00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.110
Oh!

668
00:46:26.325 --> 00:46:28.243
The school is saved!

669
00:46:40.172 --> 00:46:42.591
Mrs. Noble is so angry.

670
00:46:44.176 --> 00:46:45.886
No. livid with you.

671
00:46:47.095 --> 00:46:48.305
So are Mom and Dad.

672
00:46:48.388 --> 00:46:50.474
They're still discussing your punishment.

673
00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:57.231
Ah!

674
00:47:02.277 --> 00:47:06.198
Before you say anything.
we know you didn't mean to start a flood.

675
00:47:06.281 --> 00:47:08.867
but this does not excuse what happened.

676
00:47:08.951 --> 00:47:12.246
And you girls know better
than to throw things down the toilet.

677
00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:15.999
-I'm sorry.
-I am too. Really sorry.

678
00:47:16.083 --> 00:47:20.003
We know. but we've decided…

679
00:47:21.255 --> 00:47:22.881
to ground you both for a week.

680
00:47:22.965 --> 00:47:25.551
-Together?
-Bean. how would that be punishment?

681
00:47:25.634 --> 00:47:27.386
-No. You'll stay in your rooms.

682
00:47:27.469 --> 00:47:30.347
and work on letters
of apology to Mrs. Noble.

683
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:32.474
Apologies that you mean.

684
00:47:32.558 --> 00:47:35.978
Doesn't it count
that we got rid of the ghosts?

685
00:47:36.061 --> 00:47:38.856
Hmm… Nope. Not one little bit.

686
00:47:38.939 --> 00:47:41.692
But a whole week?

687
00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:44.027
That's forever.

688
00:47:44.111 --> 00:47:46.697
-Hmm.
-Can we just have ten more minutes?

689
00:47:47.489 --> 00:47:48.949
Please.

690
00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:55.789
You can walk Ivy home if you like.

691
00:47:57.875 --> 00:47:59.710
Katrine. would you like more coffee?

692
00:47:59.793 --> 00:48:01.169
-Yes. please.

693
00:48:01.253 --> 00:48:03.130
It has been quite the evening.

694
00:48:03.922 --> 00:48:06.300
And I will be with you in a moment. Ivy.

695
00:48:11.471 --> 00:48:13.390
Well. that was an adventure.

696
00:48:13.473 --> 00:48:15.225
Can you believe those two?

697
00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:17.394
They actually thought
they should be punished together.

698
00:48:17.477 --> 00:48:20.105
Are you sure you still want to be friends?

699
00:48:20.188 --> 00:48:23.317
I mean. I really like
that we rub off on each other.

700
00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.361
but it sure looks like
we're gonna keep getting in trouble.

701
00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:29.615
Bean. I had the best time thanks to you.
You're my best friend.

702
00:48:29.698 --> 00:48:31.283
You're my best friend too.

703
00:48:35.871 --> 00:48:39.124
We should do an oath.
An eternal friendship oath.

704
00:48:39.207 --> 00:48:40.417
In blood.

705
00:48:41.001 --> 00:48:43.462
Yes. That way. it's permanent.

706
00:48:45.505 --> 00:48:46.590
Come with me.

707
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:52.846
Nancy. go to your room.

708
00:48:53.513 --> 00:48:57.225
-What are we talking about?
-Go to your room now. Now.

709
00:48:59.311 --> 00:49:01.271
We need something sharp. A nail.

710
00:49:03.857 --> 00:49:04.691
Oh!

711
00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:12.741
This one's sharp.

712
00:49:17.245 --> 00:49:18.246
Mm…

713
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.957
Blood attracts vampires.

714
00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.002
Mmm…

715
00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:30.634
If we each oath right into this
and seal it up.

716
00:49:30.717 --> 00:49:33.679
then our words and promises
will be mixed together.

717
00:49:34.262 --> 00:49:35.263
Forever?

718
00:49:35.847 --> 00:49:38.266
Jam jars are made
for preserving things forever.

719
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:40.102
My dad just uses them for nails.

720
00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:42.562
Ready?

721
00:49:43.105 --> 00:49:43.981
Mm-hmm.

722
00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:51.697
Ivy and Bean. here on this day.
make this oath of eternal friendship.

723
00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:57.869
We cross our hearts
that we'll share all our secrets.

724
00:49:57.953 --> 00:50:03.709
our promises. troubles.
punishments. and all the good things too.

725
00:50:06.628 --> 00:50:09.881
Like adventures and dares and mysteries.

726
00:50:14.803 --> 00:50:18.974
We sanctify this sacred oath

727
00:50:19.057 --> 00:50:20.100
with…

728
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:21.643
Uh…

729
00:50:23.186 --> 00:50:24.521
Do a burp! Do a burp!

730
00:50:47.169 --> 00:50:49.588
It's gonna be tough to not play tomorrow.

731
00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:51.965
-Or the day after that.
-Mm-hmm.

732
00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:55.135
But I'll write to you every day.
or maybe every hour of every day.

733
00:50:56.344 --> 00:50:57.179
Okay.

734
00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.349
But I probably won't really want
to read that much.

735
00:51:01.433 --> 00:51:02.517
I know that.

736
00:51:02.601 --> 00:51:06.813
That's why we'll also spy from our windows
and use our walkie-talkies.

737
00:51:13.528 --> 00:51:14.404
Bye. Ivy!

738
00:51:14.488 --> 00:51:15.447
Bye. Bean!

739
00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:20.118
Good night. Katrine.

740
00:51:20.202 --> 00:51:22.621
Good night.
and thanks for the coffee.

741
00:51:39.387 --> 00:51:42.974
Ballet is about dancing
your enemies to death!

742
00:51:43.058 --> 00:51:44.810
See ya.

743
00:51:44.893 --> 00:51:48.105
Welcome to the Joyful School of Ballet.

744
00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:51.191
-Wha-What… Wha-What are you wearing?
-It's an evil duke costume.

745
00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:53.819
<i>We're not spending money</i>
<i>on something you'll quit in two weeks.</i>

746
00:51:53.902 --> 00:51:55.529
Please!

747
00:51:55.612 --> 00:51:59.116
This year's performance seats 300 people!

748
00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:01.451
The whole school will be laughing at us.

749
00:52:01.535 --> 00:52:03.245
You may not quit.

750
00:52:03.328 --> 00:52:04.412
"Forgetfulness Spell."

751
00:52:04.496 --> 00:52:06.873
They won't even remember
we talked about ballet.

752
00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:09.668
-Erase the past! Release your grief!

753
00:52:09.751 --> 00:52:12.087
-Ivy!
-Did you put a spell on us?

754
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:13.922
We should just run away.

755
00:52:14.005 --> 00:52:15.382
I love running away.

756
00:52:15.465 --> 00:52:16.633
<i>Where should we go?</i>

757
00:52:17.134 --> 00:52:20.053
<i>I've got some pretty good ideas.</i>
<i>Don't you?</i>

758
00:52:20.137 --> 00:52:22.055
You're gonna stink up the place.

759
00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:26.685
<i>I guess we're doomed. Ivy.</i>

760
00:52:26.768 --> 00:52:28.186
Doomed to dance.

761
00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:46.746
Continue through what?

762
00:52:47.414 --> 00:52:48.248
That's right.

763
00:52:49.958 --> 00:52:52.544
-Oh yeah!

764
00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.361
Just kidding.
