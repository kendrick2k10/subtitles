00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:15.041
[woman] Ready?

4
00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:23.250
E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U-L-O-M…

5
00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:26.750
M?

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:37.791
E-S-A-R-I-N-T-U…

7
00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:41.833
M-U

8
00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:44.416
E-S-A-R--

9
00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:51.750
Murder.

10
00:00:57.708 --> 00:00:59.375
Someone tried to murder you?

11
00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:03.125
Who tried to murder you?

12
00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:05.666
- [tires screeching]
- [panting]

13
00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:09.791
[doctor. muffled] Mrs. Carter?

14
00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:12.500
[thunder rumbling]

15
00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:14.083
Mrs. Carter?

16
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.833
[thunder crashes]

17
00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:19.916
[doctor continues indistinctly]

18
00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.708
Can you open your right eye
for me. Katherine?

19
00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:28.958
{\an8}Mrs. Carter?

20
00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:35.833
Can you hear me?

21
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.958
Can you hear me?

22
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.208
{\an8}You've sustained serious head trauma.

23
00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.416
- You've been in a coma for three days.
- [machine beeping]

24
00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:50.208
{\an8}Your brain stem has been damaged.

25
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:52.458
{\an8}Brain imaging and EEG are normal.

26
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:56.500
{\an8}but I… need some indication
that you can understand me.

27
00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:59.583
- [loud bang]
- [tires screech]

28
00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:01.791
{\an8}Are you able to blink?

29
00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:03.708
{\an8}Blink.

30
00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:06.625
{\an8}Nothing.

31
00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:08.958
[engine revving]

32
00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:11.708
{\an8}I want you to follow my finger
with your eyes.

33
00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:19.583
{\an8}Right eye worries me.

34
00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:24.041
{\an8}Left eye appears incapable
of voluntary movement.

35
00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:29.458
[nurse] Is she even aware?

36
00:02:31.416 --> 00:02:35.041
- [thunder crashes]
- [engine revs]

37
00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:37.416
[machine clicks. hums]

38
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.416
[nurse] Mrs. Carter.
I'm just gonna sit you up.

39
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:43.333
My name's Nicky Mackenzie.

40
00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:45.666
I work for the hospital.
but don't let that worry you.

41
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.333
I haven't killed anyone yet.

42
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.750
I'm just gonna move your head.

43
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.583
Right. I know that there's damage
to your right eye.

44
00:02:57.666 --> 00:03:00.916
but can you try
and move your left eye for me?

45
00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:05.875
I won't give up if you don't.

46
00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:10.333
Not until you can blink or move your eye

47
00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:13.125
from the left to the right.

48
00:03:14.541 --> 00:03:17.916
I'm going to continue
to assume that there's someone in there.

49
00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.416
Well. I'm out of a job
if there isn't. [chuckles]

50
00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:27.791
[man speaking indistinctly over phone]

51
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:33.000
I know.

52
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.041
I'm waiting. I'll let you know.

53
00:03:40.791 --> 00:03:41.791
[Nicky] Lina Carter.

54
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.791
You don't remember me. do you?

55
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.833
Come on.

56
00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:52.875
[Lina] They said something about. um…

57
00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:56.500
locked-in syndrome.

58
00:03:58.291 --> 00:03:59.125
Right.

59
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.125
It means

60
00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:06.125
a loss of limb function and speech

61
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.625
in what they call
"cognitively intact individuals."

62
00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:12.375
So usually.

63
00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:15.875
if she was conscious.
she'd be able to communicate

64
00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:19.250
with. um. a blink
or a movement of her eye.

65
00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:20.416
but in her case.

66
00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.375
the good eye is immovable.

67
00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:26.666
So…

68
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.500
[inhales] Well…

69
00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:30.000
[sighs] It means

70
00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:34.125
she's either in and out of consciousness.

71
00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:37.000
or she can't control her eye.

72
00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:39.166
or…

73
00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:43.125
she's in a vegetative state.

74
00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:48.250
We just don't know yet.

75
00:04:50.166 --> 00:04:51.208
Will she recover?

76
00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:54.375
If she's in there…

77
00:04:57.416 --> 00:04:58.416
I'll find her.

78
00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:04.583
I'm a neuroclinical nurse. It's what I do.

79
00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:09.708
Tell me about her.

80
00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:12.791
[gasps softly]

81
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:19.958
[Lina] <i>I've known Katherine all my life.</i>

82
00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:25.791
<i>And when Mom died.</i>
<i>she became my legal guardian.</i>

83
00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:29.500
<i>And Rowling Manor became my home.</i>

84
00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:37.750
<i>Back then. Katherine was rich.</i>
<i>glamorous and famous.</i>

85
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:41.833
<i>I loved everything about her.</i>

86
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:44.791
<i>And I would've done anything for her.</i>

87
00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:49.541
<i>I suppose all I ever wanted was</i>
<i>for her to love me. </i>[gasps]

88
00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:56.666
<i>But everything</i>
<i>had been turned upside down.</i>

89
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.625
<i>When Katherine's husband died.</i>

90
00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:02.791
<i>he cut her out of his will</i>
<i>and left everything to his son Jamie.</i>

91
00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:04.708
[crowd chattering]

92
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:06.916
[Lina] <i>And it poisoned their relationship.</i>

93
00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:19.875
<i>I'd just lost my mom.</i>
<i>and I needed a family.</i>

94
00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:21.500
[chattering]

95
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:24.625
[Lina] <i>If they couldn't be there for</i>
<i>each other. I'd be there for both of them.</i>

96
00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:31.583
<i>I couldn't save my mom.</i>

97
00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:35.625
<i>so I was damn well</i>
<i>gonna try and save them.</i>

98
00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:39.666
- [dog barking]
- [horse chuffing]

99
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.541
[crowd continues chattering. laughing]

100
00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:46.375
- Hold on.
- [Lina grunts]

101
00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.083
[horse whinnies]

102
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.041
[playing slow-tempo tune]

103
00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:17.750
[children laughing]

104
00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:23.583
[laughing]

105
00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:25.250
[Lina] Jamie!

106
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:27.125
Katherine. help!

107
00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:31.291
- Aren't we supposed to grab his tongue?
- Not unless you wanna lose a finger.

108
00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:33.500
- What if he chokes?
- Turn him on his side.

109
00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:35.250
Put it under his head. Here.

110
00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:38.708
- [grunting]
- [Lina] Should we call Dr. Lawrence?

111
00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:41.125
- What do we do?
- [Katherine] We keep an eye on him.

112
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.541
If it lasts more than five minutes.
we'll call an ambulance.

113
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.125
[Lina] He's not breathing.

114
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:51.416
He'll start again in a minute.
Check his airway isn't blocked.

115
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.166
[operator] <i>Emergency services.</i>
<i>Which service do you require?</i>

116
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:56.125
[Katherine sighs] He's breathing.

117
00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.083
False alarm.

118
00:07:57.791 --> 00:07:58.791
[phone beeps]

119
00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:02.083
Are you all right?

120
00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:32.750
First night out in two years.

121
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.833
You look so beautiful.

122
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.708
Where are you going?

123
00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:41.041
I'm meeting a director.

124
00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:44.166
My mobile number's on the fridge.

125
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.958
Call me if you need me.
but. uh. don't call.

126
00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:49.916
We'll be fine.
Jamie's feeling better today.

127
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and he's never seen your show.
I'm gonna make him watch season one.

128
00:08:55.083 --> 00:08:58.000
He milks them. my stepson. the seizures.

129
00:08:58.833 --> 00:08:59.750
Then he brings them on

130
00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:03.166
to punish me the moment I try
to live any sort of life for myself.

131
00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:05.875
Maybe he just misses his dad.

132
00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:10.583
It's hard when someone you love dies.

133
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.958
I should know. [exhales]

134
00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:20.833
You're a good girl. Lina.

135
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.833
Your mom was lucky to have you.

136
00:09:32.916 --> 00:09:35.583
- [exhales] How do I look?
- Amazing.

137
00:09:35.666 --> 00:09:37.750
- Ready for my big comeback?
- Definitely.

138
00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:40.541
Ugh. Mutton dressed as lamb. [scoffs]

139
00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:55.375
- [man shouts on screen]
- [dramatic music playing]

140
00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:58.000
[girl] <i>Mommy?</i>

141
00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:00.958
[Katherine] <i>What's wrong?</i>

142
00:10:02.291 --> 00:10:03.666
<i>I'm scared.</i>

143
00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:08.375
<i>Oh. You're a very brave girl.</i>

144
00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:11.666
<i>and we're gonna</i>
<i>get through this together. okay?</i>

145
00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:17.583
I heard what happened.

146
00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:21.416
To your mom.

147
00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:23.375
You're safe here.

148
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.208
With me.

149
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:28.750
- You'll protect me. will you?
- [exhales]

150
00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:30.166
Promise?

151
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.583
[chuckles] I promise.

152
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.833
What was she like?

153
00:10:37.541 --> 00:10:38.375
My mom?

154
00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:40.291
She was brilliant.

155
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.000
She played the piano.

156
00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:46.458
- Well. sort of.
- [chuckles]

157
00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:50.333
She taught me the basics. anyway.
I can teach you if you like.

158
00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:56.000
I don't remember my real mom.

159
00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:02.291
I remember my dad.

160
00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:09.541
Sometimes his face
gets a bit fuzzy though.

161
00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:14.750
Like I'm starting to forget him too.

162
00:11:17.416 --> 00:11:19.333
Katherine got rid of the photos.

163
00:11:20.583 --> 00:11:21.833
Most of them. anyway.

164
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.333
It's hard.

165
00:11:27.166 --> 00:11:28.083
Losing someone.

166
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.500
Anyway. we've got each other now.

167
00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.125
- [dramatic music playing]
- [vocalizing]

168
00:11:53.791 --> 00:11:55.791
[gasping]

169
00:11:58.291 --> 00:11:59.208
Katherine.

170
00:12:09.083 --> 00:12:09.916
[exhales]

171
00:12:20.166 --> 00:12:22.166
[machines beeping]

172
00:12:25.625 --> 00:12:27.583
[Nicky] You know. it takes an act of faith

173
00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:31.000
to say to yourself.
"She's still the same underneath."

174
00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:37.625
The police say that. um.
she was knocked down by a driver.

175
00:12:37.708 --> 00:12:39.333
Is that right? A hit-and-run?

176
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.500
They're not sure.

177
00:12:43.041 --> 00:12:43.875
Right.

178
00:12:45.291 --> 00:12:47.583
Hmm. Will you help me out with something?

179
00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:50.250
I… I just can't wrap me head around it.

180
00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:51.666
[inhales] Um.

181
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.666
Katherine's your adopted mother.

182
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.750
but she's also your mother-in-law.

183
00:12:57.833 --> 00:12:59.000
It's complicated.

184
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.333
Oh. Well. I like complicated.

185
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.166
I couldn't abandon him.

186
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:11.833
<i>By the time we were married.</i>

187
00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.458
<i>Jamie depended on me</i>
<i>for absolutely everything.</i>

188
00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:15.708
[classical music playing]

189
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:18.958
<i>He needed me.</i>
<i>And to be honest. I needed him too.</i>

190
00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:23.291
<i>I'd looked after him for so long.</i>
<i>he'd become my whole life.</i>

191
00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:24.958
- She's had too many.
- [laughing]

192
00:13:25.041 --> 00:13:26.916
[Lina] <i>I was Jamie's reason for living.</i>

193
00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:29.708
<i>- And I told myself he was mine.</i>
<i>- </i>[Katherine exhales]

194
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:34.541
[Lina] <i>But Katherine thought</i>
<i>I was a treacherous gold digger.</i>

195
00:13:36.208 --> 00:13:38.166
<i>- She thought I was stealing her home.</i>
- [mutters]

196
00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:41.291
[Lina] <i>When all I was trying to do</i>
<i>was make us a family.</i>

197
00:13:41.375 --> 00:13:43.500
[glass clanking]

198
00:13:43.583 --> 00:13:45.708
[sniffles] Lina.

199
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.541
My beloved daughter-in-law.

200
00:13:49.916 --> 00:13:52.250
Which I did not see coming. [laughing]

201
00:13:55.208 --> 00:13:59.083
[exhales] Who'd have thought
that when you turned up here…

202
00:13:59.166 --> 00:14:01.416
[sniffles] …a helpless waif and stray.

203
00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:04.708
completely dependent on my kindness. that…

204
00:14:06.666 --> 00:14:07.750
that you'd end up…

205
00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:13.041
[laughing] …lady of the bloody manor.

206
00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.333
To Jamie and Lina. [sniffles]

207
00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:23.333
[all] To Jamie and Lina.

208
00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:35.291
[slurps]

209
00:14:35.375 --> 00:14:37.416
- [dance music playing]
- [chattering. laughing]

210
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.875
[man laughs]

211
00:14:48.375 --> 00:14:49.208
Look at her.

212
00:14:50.666 --> 00:14:52.625
- Showing off.
- She's not.

213
00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:53.625
[Jamie] She is.

214
00:14:54.458 --> 00:14:57.750
She was nice to you before we got engaged.
Suddenly. starts treating you like shit.

215
00:14:57.833 --> 00:14:59.750
- What does that tell you. hmm?
- Jamie.

216
00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:04.791
This house. that's all she cares about.

217
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.333
Not us. Definitely not me.

218
00:15:08.416 --> 00:15:11.166
Will you stop it?
This is our wedding night.

219
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.958
Exactly. Anyone would think
it's all about her.

220
00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:18.833
Fucking Hollywood has-been
plays lady of the manor.

221
00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:25.291
- I'll spoil her fun.
- Jamie. don't you dare.

222
00:15:25.375 --> 00:15:27.416
- [Jamie grunting]
- Please! [exclaims]

223
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.791
- [crowd gasps]
- [Lina grunts]

224
00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:34.500
[man] Clear the floor.

225
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.458
- [woman] Stand back. Give him some space.
- [man] Somebody help.

226
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:40.958
- Excuse me.
- [man 2] I presume she knows.

227
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.125
[woman 2 gasps] Oh. my God. what happened?

228
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
[dance music continues. muffled]

229
00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:00.291
[Dr. Lawrence] Seizures aside. Jamie.

230
00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:02.333
we've got to get you off
of these pain meds.

231
00:16:02.416 --> 00:16:06.333
- You're the one who gave them to me.
- With the strict proviso not to drink.

232
00:16:06.416 --> 00:16:08.000
I keep telling him.

233
00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:11.791
It's my wedding day.
Anyway. I pay you to write prescriptions.

234
00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:16.166
You're a village GP.
You're not some Harley Street specialist.

235
00:16:16.916 --> 00:16:19.583
- You've got ideas above your station.
- [sighs]

236
00:16:19.666 --> 00:16:22.208
[Jamie] She's bad enough.
She watches me like a bloody hawk.

237
00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:25.041
I take them as prescribed.

238
00:16:25.958 --> 00:16:27.000
Mostly.

239
00:16:27.083 --> 00:16:28.625
I'm in pain.

240
00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:32.750
- Neither of you know what it's like.
- [Lina] We understand. Jamie.

241
00:16:32.833 --> 00:16:36.208
Right. I will come
and see you tomorrow morning.

242
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:37.583
Yeah. yeah. fine.

243
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.625
[exhales] I'm so sorry this has happened.
tonight of all nights. Lina.

244
00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:50.083
If there's anything I can do.
anything at all.

245
00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:51.750
please don't hesitate to ask.

246
00:16:54.625 --> 00:16:55.458
Thank you.

247
00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:32.916
[Dr. Lawrence] I'm just
looking out for you. Lina.

248
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.083
[huffs]

249
00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:50.000
[Nicky] I'm just gonna lie you back.

250
00:17:50.625 --> 00:17:51.625
There we are.

251
00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:54.208
I'm going to do your hands now.

252
00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.500
Just gonna go in between your fingers.

253
00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:06.458
- Here.
- Me?

254
00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:09.625
[Nicky] Mm-hmm. Come on.

255
00:18:16.166 --> 00:18:19.291
Well. you're gonna have to
learn how to do it at some point.

256
00:18:21.416 --> 00:18:23.208
Do you wanna get her shoulder?

257
00:18:25.458 --> 00:18:26.291
Go on.

258
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.541
Oh. here. Hands.

259
00:18:31.166 --> 00:18:32.000
There.

260
00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.125
Just take that down.

261
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.958
Just careful around the ECG spot.

262
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.583
Up round the neck.

263
00:18:58.666 --> 00:18:59.583
[blubbers]

264
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.125
[gasps]

265
00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.625
[Nicky] It's an unlucky lot. your lot.

266
00:19:08.458 --> 00:19:10.541
First Jamie. now…

267
00:19:12.125 --> 00:19:12.958
now Katherine.

268
00:19:15.666 --> 00:19:16.500
Jamie.

269
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.541
I used to look after him.

270
00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:20.833
Do you not remember me?

271
00:19:24.125 --> 00:19:25.916
What's Jamie got to do with anything?

272
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.833
I don't know.

273
00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:29.000
You tell me. love.

274
00:19:32.666 --> 00:19:34.208
[Lina] <i>Jamie was always ill.</i>

275
00:19:35.583 --> 00:19:37.208
<i>First. it was the seizures.</i>

276
00:19:38.125 --> 00:19:39.041
<i>- Then…</i>
<i>- </i>[Jamie] Lina!

277
00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:40.166
[Lina] Coming!

278
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.250
<i>…lots of things.</i>

279
00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:43.333
- [Jamie] Where are you?
- Your Royal fucking Highness…

280
00:19:43.416 --> 00:19:46.041
<i>- So he never left the house.</i>
- [Jamie] Lina. come on!

281
00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:48.083
[Lina] <i>And neither did I.</i>

282
00:19:48.166 --> 00:19:49.041
Oh!

283
00:19:51.083 --> 00:19:52.041
- Oh.
- Sorry.

284
00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:53.125
No. my fault.

285
00:19:54.791 --> 00:19:56.166
[both chuckle] Oh!

286
00:19:57.375 --> 00:19:58.666
[Katherine mutters]

287
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.750
All right. [sighs]

288
00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:00.750
Uh…

289
00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:04.625
- What's that?
- Nothing.

290
00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.583
[sighs] Here you go.

291
00:20:12.291 --> 00:20:14.041
No rest for the wicked. [exhales]

292
00:20:24.666 --> 00:20:27.208
- [exhales]
- You've got to get off these pain meds.

293
00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:28.458
Don't start.

294
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:30.333
[sighs]

295
00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:33.625
- [groans] It's dripping.
- Don't be such a baby.

296
00:20:33.708 --> 00:20:35.166
I'm soaking wet now.

297
00:20:37.291 --> 00:20:39.375
- [grunts]
- It'll cool the inflammation.

298
00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:41.958
[Jamie sighs]

299
00:20:43.416 --> 00:20:44.458
Mm.

300
00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:46.166
Nice?

301
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.083
[sighs] Yeah.

302
00:20:48.958 --> 00:20:49.958
Yeah. thank you.

303
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.250
We should get married again.

304
00:20:53.875 --> 00:20:56.041
[exhales] It was
the happiest day of my life.

305
00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:58.083
Passing out?

306
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.791
Dr. Lawrence had
to carry you up the stairs.

307
00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:03.208
[groans] Him again.

308
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.958
Don't ever leave me.

309
00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:18.916
Say that you won't.

310
00:21:21.625 --> 00:21:22.458
[sniffles]

311
00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:28.500
It's not safe out there. Lina.
beyond these walls.

312
00:21:28.583 --> 00:21:30.833
- [pills rattle]
- You of all people know that.

313
00:21:30.916 --> 00:21:32.333
I'm only going for a swim.

314
00:21:34.083 --> 00:21:35.291
It's cold out there.

315
00:21:36.666 --> 00:21:38.250
- [pills rattle]
- On the streets.

316
00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:43.916
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

317
00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:54.375
[Dr. Lawrence] Good morning.
How's his nibs?

318
00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.833
The pills are making him worse.

319
00:22:00.333 --> 00:22:02.333
I've got some steroids we can try.

320
00:22:03.416 --> 00:22:04.416
If they reduce the pain.

321
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.416
then we can wean
him off the Oxy. gradually.

322
00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:12.208
But in the meantime.
I don't want you wearing yourself out.

323
00:22:12.291 --> 00:22:13.791
waiting on him hand and foot.

324
00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:15.208
You're ten years too late.

325
00:22:16.291 --> 00:22:17.125
Yeah.

326
00:22:18.916 --> 00:22:20.333
Win the lottery. did you?

327
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.958
Oh. you mean these?
No. they're just good fakes.

328
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.708
I mean the car. [chuckles]

329
00:22:27.291 --> 00:22:29.250
The car. yes. [laughs]

330
00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:33.791
What do you reckon?
Nice. huh? Splashed out on a loan.

331
00:22:36.541 --> 00:22:37.583
You off for a swim?

332
00:22:38.583 --> 00:22:40.791
If I can make it
without the bloody bell ringing.

333
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.125
It must be freezing in there.

334
00:22:43.208 --> 00:22:44.916
I jump in
before I can get second thoughts.

335
00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:47.250
Do you?

336
00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:04.708
What's the difference
between a good joke and a bad joke?

337
00:23:06.125 --> 00:23:06.958
I don't know.

338
00:23:09.458 --> 00:23:10.541
Timing.

339
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.583
[both laugh]

340
00:23:13.666 --> 00:23:15.958
- That's awful.
- [Dr. Lawrence] It's absolutely terrible.

341
00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:18.625
But you laughed. and that means
you definitely need to get out more.

342
00:23:24.375 --> 00:23:25.666
Where would I go? [gasps]

343
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:28.000
Oh. Lina.

344
00:23:29.666 --> 00:23:31.375
There's a whole world out there.

345
00:23:32.083 --> 00:23:34.000
You can't hide out here forever.

346
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.750
Can't I? [inhales]

347
00:23:53.625 --> 00:23:56.833
[classical music playing]

348
00:24:23.916 --> 00:24:25.041
[bell tolling]

349
00:24:29.208 --> 00:24:31.208
[tolling continues]

350
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.750
[tolling continues]

351
00:24:51.625 --> 00:24:52.458
[Lina] Jamie!

352
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.208
- [Katherine] What's happening?
- Call an ambulance.

353
00:24:58.625 --> 00:24:59.458
Now!

354
00:25:06.958 --> 00:25:07.916
[machines beeping]

355
00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:32.291
How's our patient today?

356
00:25:32.375 --> 00:25:35.000
- Oh. uh. he seems to be doing much better.
- [Nicky] Hmm?

357
00:25:36.083 --> 00:25:37.625
I'm sorry. you are…?

358
00:25:38.208 --> 00:25:40.333
[clicks tongue]
Yes. uh. Dr. Robert Lawrence.

359
00:25:40.416 --> 00:25:42.791
Oh. [exhales]

360
00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:47.291
I. um. I don't… don't know
a doctor here with that name.

361
00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:50.166
- Well. I'm his GP.
- Oh!

362
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:51.541
What are you doing here?

363
00:25:51.625 --> 00:25:54.000
[Robert] I'm also a close family friend.

364
00:25:54.083 --> 00:25:55.250
Oh. okay.

365
00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.791
You're not the one who prescribed him
the painkillers. are you?

366
00:26:02.916 --> 00:26:04.333
I'm sorry. You are?

367
00:26:04.416 --> 00:26:08.333
I'm Nurse Mackenzie. I'm neuroclinical.

368
00:26:09.666 --> 00:26:12.541
I mean. I deal with anyone who comes
in here with neurological problems.

369
00:26:12.625 --> 00:26:14.416
including grand mal seizures.

370
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.958
Right. So you'll know
that there are no contraindications

371
00:26:17.041 --> 00:26:19.291
between his pain meds
and his seizure medication.

372
00:26:19.375 --> 00:26:23.375
And you'll know that 80 milligrams
of codeine is hardly a responsible dosage

373
00:26:23.458 --> 00:26:25.250
to give to someone who appears

374
00:26:26.416 --> 00:26:29.041
to have problems with painkillers.

375
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:35.375
[Robert clicks tongue] I think we should
give the family some peace and quiet.

376
00:26:36.083 --> 00:26:36.958
[Nicky] Hmm?

377
00:26:39.083 --> 00:26:41.708
[scoffs] All right.

378
00:26:41.791 --> 00:26:43.083
[Robert] Be right back.

379
00:26:46.041 --> 00:26:48.916
I don't appreciate people casting
professional aspersions on me.

380
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.916
No. I was just--

381
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.500
Especially in front of a patient
and his family.

382
00:26:53.625 --> 00:26:55.666
by someone who barely knows
the young man in question.

383
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:57.708
and is. in any case.
completely unqualified

384
00:26:57.791 --> 00:27:00.916
to make judgments about
the patient's reliance on pain medication.

385
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.541
I'm his GP. You're a nurse.

386
00:27:03.125 --> 00:27:04.375
Show some respect.

387
00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:08.458
Mr. Carter

388
00:27:10.083 --> 00:27:11.375
is under my care now.

389
00:27:20.375 --> 00:27:21.625
[Robert] Sorry about that.

390
00:27:36.791 --> 00:27:38.708
- [knock on door]
- Come in.

391
00:27:43.625 --> 00:27:45.458
[clears throat] Lina.

392
00:27:45.541 --> 00:27:47.125
- I'm interrupting.
- [Robert] No. no. Um…

393
00:27:47.208 --> 00:27:50.125
[clears throat] Excuse me.
Not at all. Please come in.

394
00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:55.208
He must have rung the bell
right before it happened.

395
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.583
[inhales] I think he did it to punish me.

396
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.166
[sobs]

397
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.416
[inhales] I don't know which is worse.

398
00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:12.416
Spending the rest of my life trying

399
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.666
to fix someone
that doesn't wanna be fixed…

400
00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:18.375
[exhales]

401
00:28:18.458 --> 00:28:19.958
[gasps] …or admitting that…

402
00:28:22.791 --> 00:28:25.333
[inhales] …without him.
my life would be empty.

403
00:28:28.625 --> 00:28:31.000
Caring for someone like Jamie
can be stressful.

404
00:28:35.416 --> 00:28:36.958
It's none of my business.

405
00:28:42.125 --> 00:28:44.541
But when was the last time
you had any fun?

406
00:28:44.625 --> 00:28:45.708
[scoffs]

407
00:28:46.416 --> 00:28:47.250
[laughs]

408
00:28:49.916 --> 00:28:50.916
Can't remember.

409
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.333
Well…

410
00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:55.708
personally…

411
00:28:57.958 --> 00:28:59.541
I'd recommend a holiday.

412
00:29:00.583 --> 00:29:01.625
Somewhere hot.

413
00:29:02.958 --> 00:29:04.083
Let your hair down.

414
00:29:05.666 --> 00:29:07.750
Drink till you fall over.

415
00:29:07.833 --> 00:29:09.666
Dance a lot.

416
00:29:10.375 --> 00:29:13.750
Preferably the samba or the rumba.

417
00:29:13.833 --> 00:29:15.666
- Or possibly the mumba.
- [chuckles]

418
00:29:16.625 --> 00:29:18.458
- The mumba?
- [laughs]

419
00:29:23.833 --> 00:29:24.708
With who?

420
00:29:28.958 --> 00:29:29.791
A friend.

421
00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:38.041
Doctor's orders.

422
00:29:40.458 --> 00:29:42.458
Stand up to them. Lina.

423
00:30:08.041 --> 00:30:09.166
[Robert exhales]

424
00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:11.666
[exhales]

425
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.416
[Lina gasps]

426
00:30:16.458 --> 00:30:18.458
[panting]

427
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:24.875
[respirator hissing]

428
00:30:57.375 --> 00:30:59.750
[panting]

429
00:30:59.833 --> 00:31:01.291
- [thudding]
- Fuck!

430
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.625
[Robert] You all right?

431
00:31:05.208 --> 00:31:06.083
Cut my foot.

432
00:31:06.583 --> 00:31:09.541
Oh. well. hop in. I'll take you back
to the house and have a look at it.

433
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:11.791
No. thanks.

434
00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:13.791
[laughs] Don't be silly.

435
00:31:14.958 --> 00:31:17.666
Let me help you. Look at you.
You're hobbling. and you're gonna ruin…

436
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.750
[continues indistinct]

437
00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:24.375
[horse chuffing]

438
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.208
[Katherine] Lina.

439
00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:35.208
I'm okay. It's just a cut.
Looks worse than it is.

440
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.541
[exhales] You must think
I'm a bloody fool.

441
00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:41.916
Sorry?

442
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.583
Come here.

443
00:31:49.625 --> 00:31:50.791
[winces]

444
00:31:51.708 --> 00:31:55.041
Katherine… is there something wrong?

445
00:31:55.625 --> 00:31:57.666
When I took you in. you had nothing.

446
00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:00.791
Now I'm practically a lodger
in my own home.

447
00:32:00.875 --> 00:32:02.583
which isn't even mine anymore.

448
00:32:04.416 --> 00:32:06.708
I sunk everything I had into Rowling
and for what. hmm?

449
00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:08.416
You've had a life for the last ten years

450
00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.583
because I took over
and looked after Jamie.

451
00:32:11.458 --> 00:32:12.625
I'm not his wife.

452
00:32:14.041 --> 00:32:15.041
I'm his mother.

453
00:32:16.708 --> 00:32:19.125
His nurse. his carer.

454
00:32:20.041 --> 00:32:21.875
Different words for the same thing.

455
00:32:23.166 --> 00:32:24.166
Servant.

456
00:32:28.916 --> 00:32:30.125
This is your home.

457
00:32:31.666 --> 00:32:33.125
It'll always be your home.

458
00:32:35.291 --> 00:32:38.875
How dare you offer me the crumbs
from my own fucking table!

459
00:32:46.541 --> 00:32:48.041
I don't have to take this anymore.

460
00:32:48.125 --> 00:32:49.333
Then leave.

461
00:32:55.333 --> 00:32:56.208
Why should I?

462
00:33:08.083 --> 00:33:11.000
- [Robert grunts] Missed it.
- [Lina] I'm just embarrassing myself now.

463
00:33:11.083 --> 00:33:13.291
[Robert] Close though.
I think you're getting better.

464
00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:14.625
[groans]

465
00:33:15.958 --> 00:33:17.708
- [Jamie] What was that?
- [Robert laughing]

466
00:33:17.791 --> 00:33:19.541
[Jamie] Ugh. that was terrible.

467
00:33:19.625 --> 00:33:20.833
[Lina laughs]

468
00:33:23.291 --> 00:33:25.625
- I told you I was crap at tennis.
- [laughing]

469
00:33:25.708 --> 00:33:28.375
[Jamie] Crap is putting it mildly. Jesus.

470
00:33:28.458 --> 00:33:31.416
- [Lina] Now you're just showing off.
- [Robert] Nice. Nice.

471
00:33:32.791 --> 00:33:33.666
Get it! Get it!

472
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:34.958
- [groaning]
- [Lina] Oh. my God!

473
00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:35.958
[laughs]

474
00:33:36.541 --> 00:33:37.500
New balls!

475
00:33:38.125 --> 00:33:39.333
Are you okay?

476
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.583
- [groans]
- [Lina] I'm so sorry.

477
00:33:43.666 --> 00:33:45.666
[respirator hissing]

478
00:34:04.708 --> 00:34:06.375
- Whiskey.
- [bartender] Scotch?

479
00:34:07.541 --> 00:34:08.375
Yeah.

480
00:34:08.875 --> 00:34:10.125
[bartender] There we go.

481
00:34:22.625 --> 00:34:24.833
- Evening.
- [Robert] Um…

482
00:34:26.125 --> 00:34:28.458
- I'll have a Shiraz.
- [bartender] Coming up.

483
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.000
[gasps]

484
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.625
- [Robert] I'm glad you called. Lina.
- [exhales]

485
00:34:50.166 --> 00:34:53.750
- [exhales]
- [Robert] Is… everything okay?

486
00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.500
I shouldn't have come.

487
00:35:00.916 --> 00:35:02.500
[Robert] I'll drive you home if you like.

488
00:35:04.458 --> 00:35:06.041
[thunder crashes]

489
00:35:06.916 --> 00:35:08.916

[gasping]

492
00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:24.083
Pull over.

493
00:35:48.125 --> 00:35:50.125
[panting]

494
00:35:52.666 --> 00:35:54.791
[thunder crashing]

495
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.166

00:36:31.083 --> 00:36:32.375
[Robert exhales]

506
00:37:27.958 --> 00:37:30.208
Lina. Lina.

507
00:37:31.708 --> 00:37:32.791
Yes.

508
00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:34.875
Robert's coming over
for dinner this evening.

509
00:37:35.375 --> 00:37:37.250
Perhaps you'd give us all
a little concert?

510
00:37:38.208 --> 00:37:39.041
[chuckles] What?

511
00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:41.708
Oh. I couldn't.

512
00:37:42.541 --> 00:37:43.583
It's my birthday.

513
00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:48.166
I know.

514
00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:52.291
It's just I'm so out of practice.

515
00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:54.916
[scoffs] It's only family.
No need to impress us.

516
00:37:58.791 --> 00:37:59.625
Tell you what.

517
00:38:00.583 --> 00:38:02.541
Why don't we pick you out a nice dress?

518
00:38:03.333 --> 00:38:06.375
Something that shows off
that gorgeous young figure of yours.

519
00:38:14.916 --> 00:38:17.750
[Nicky] I used to watch you on the telly
all the time.

520
00:38:17.833 --> 00:38:19.708
You were a huge star.

521
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.833
Oh. Katherine. what happened?

522
00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:29.375
What really happened?

523
00:38:31.625 --> 00:38:33.458
Right. I know this is a bit premature.

524
00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:38.666
but… this is an alphabet board.

525
00:38:39.875 --> 00:38:43.666
What's gonna happen.
I'm gonna read out the letters. out loud.

526
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:44.833
and you're gonna blink.

527
00:38:45.416 --> 00:38:51.833
E-S-A-R-I-N

528
00:38:51.916 --> 00:38:56.666

the first thing I would do
is buy your mom a proper piano. so I did.

552
00:40:48.916 --> 00:40:52.833
We were like sisters.
I was always at her house. It was…

553
00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:56.291
safer than the foster home.

554
00:40:59.125 --> 00:41:01.750
I got out of poverty. She didn't.

555
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.916
I became a Hollywood star.

556

affect our friendship. but. uh…

she stopped making any effort.

559

and… the more I reached out to her.

560
00:41:19.958 --> 00:41:21.958
the more she cold-shouldered me.

561
00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:26.166
until eventually.
she more or less cut me out completely.

562
00:41:26.916 --> 00:41:28.333
Why would she do that?

563
00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:33.083

to shatter my faith in humankind.

our relationship. for your sake.

to California on school holidays.

If it wasn't for me. you'd have ended up
in a foster home like I did.

You wanted to come home with me.
You wanted to live with me.

and your mom's bitterness and envy.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:08.541
Show you that I don't have to
always be such a bloody misery.

705
00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:12.750
Look. I'm sorry about what I said.

706
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:14.875
All right. forgive me?

707
00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:18.916
You're the last person in the world
that I'd wanna hurt. I love you.

708
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.875
I love you too.

709
00:53:20.958 --> 00:53:22.125
Let's go. Okay.

710
00:53:23.041 --> 00:53:24.166
- [Robert] Okay?
- [Jamie] Yep.

711
00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:35.583
There are people on the other side
of the island. cutting down trees.

712
00:53:36.125 --> 00:53:36.958
I know.

713
00:53:38.625 --> 00:53:39.500
Do as I say.

714
00:53:45.125 --> 00:53:46.250
Get in the boat.

715
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:48.833
[Jamie] Now who's the one that's scared?

716
00:53:49.416 --> 00:53:51.541
Will she get in? Won't she get in?

717
00:53:52.166 --> 00:53:54.625
Come on. Lina.
It's only a little boat ride.

718
00:53:54.708 --> 00:53:56.083

720
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.291
[Jamie] Finally.
It wasn't that hard. was it?

721
00:54:08.458 --> 00:54:10.250
This is exciting. no?

722
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:21.583
It's cold.

723
00:54:28.541 --> 00:54:29.625
There's a nice spot.

724
00:54:31.125 --> 00:54:33.583
See that? That sandy bit.
We're going past it.

725
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:36.750
Where are you going?

726
00:54:47.125 --> 00:54:49.458

You're missing the bloody island.

He's not much of a boatman. is he?

733
00:55:34.125 --> 00:55:35.083
Careful.

734
00:55:36.958 --> 00:55:38.041

[Nicky] Well. you must
have known he couldn't swim.

764
00:59:23.208 --> 00:59:24.750
It was in the local paper.

765
00:59:27.875 --> 00:59:29.583
Whose idea was the boat trip?

766
00:59:34.083 --> 00:59:34.916
[Lina] Jamie's.

767
00:59:38.291 --> 00:59:39.625
- [Nicky] Really?
- [exhales]

768
00:59:40.125 --> 00:59:42.375
[Nicky] Hmm? It wasn't Dr. Lawrence's?

769
00:59:44.166 --> 00:59:47.375
I've seen you both.
I've seen the way you are together.

770
00:59:49.041 --> 00:59:50.791
How long's it been going on?

771
00:59:53.333 --> 00:59:55.875
How long have you
been seeing Dr. Lawrence?

772
00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:00.958
The boat capsized.

773
01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:03.541
We all fell in. I…

774
01:00:04.875 --> 01:00:10.041
I tried to save him. but he… he kept
flailing around. dragging me down.

775
01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:11.833
[Nicky] And then. um…

776
01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:14.416
[clicks tongue] …what. you. uh…

777
01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:19.375
you couldn't divorce him
because you'd lose everything?

778
01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:20.750
It tipped!

779
01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:24.875
I… I don't remember why.
One of them must have lent over too far.

780
01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:26.750
Is that why Jamie had to drown?

781
01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:32.833
Look. the police. they're not gonna
give you the benefit of the doubt.

782
01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:33.750
They're not.

783
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.041
The fact that you were dragged into this

784
01:00:37.125 --> 01:00:39.916
by a doctor that everybody trusts.

785
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:41.666
Except me.

786

over-prescribed painkillers

787

Lina. listen.

789
01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.916
I know what it's like
to be pushed into a corner

790
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.583
when you're too frightened
to speak out against him.

791
01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:05.125
No one dragged me into anything.

- Something to help you sleep.
- [exhales]

811
01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:50.750
I have to go.

812
01:04:53.666 --> 01:04:55.375
I don't care where. Just far.

813
01:04:58.041 --> 01:05:00.125
We can never be happy here. Robert.

814
01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:02.541
Not with her.

815
01:05:04.625 --> 01:05:06.000
- If she--
- Sell the house.

816
01:05:07.458 --> 01:05:08.291
What?

817
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:12.625
It's yours to sell now.

818
01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.583
It's… It's Katherine's home.

819
01:05:17.666 --> 01:05:19.041
Forget about Katherine.

820
01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:25.000
I can't… I can't sell it. I promised her.

821
01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:27.375
Then what's the sense in what we did?

822
01:05:30.375 --> 01:05:33.625
I risked everything for you.

823
01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:36.000
For us.

824
01:05:38.458 --> 01:05:41.000
This is how we get free. Lina.

825
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:45.958
If you sell Rowling. we'll never
have to worry about money again.

826

Is… Is that what this is all about?

827
01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:54.250
- Money?
- No. it's about freedom.

so you let me do your dirty work.

841

Yes. but how tightly?

843
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.666
You seduced me.

844
01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:03.125
Then you took your husband.
who can't swim.

845
01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:06.125
out on the lake without a life jacket.
and you capsized the boat.

- It was you!
- Why didn't you tell that to the police?

847

So we have to work together on this.

1008

And what exactly do you suggest we do?

1009
01:18:59.958 --> 01:19:01.250
We take her home.

1010
01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:04.166
Now.

1011
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.416

[pills rattling]

1031
01:21:41.333 --> 01:21:45.416
[Robert] People with locked-in syndrome
usually suffer sudden. violent strokes.

1032
01:21:46.625 --> 01:21:50.125
Morphine and something to counteract
the blood thinner should do it.

1033
01:21:50.708 --> 01:21:52.666
She has a lot of medication
in her bloodstream.

1034
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:54.458
which should cover our tracks.

1035
01:21:57.125 --> 01:21:59.041
What will we tell the police?

1036
01:21:59.125 --> 01:22:02.750
She was thrown from her horse.
She sustained serious head injuries.

1037
01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:06.041
She wandered into the road and got hit
by a driver who fled the scene.

1038
01:22:06.125 --> 01:22:07.291
It's all in the police report.

1039
01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:09.208
Whatever she told that nurse.
she was confused.

1040
01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.833
I discharged her. You brought her home.

1041
01:22:11.916 --> 01:22:13.250
She died in her sleep.

Oh. come on. Pick up. pick up. pick up.

1044
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.333
They won't believe us.

1045
01:22:22.541 --> 01:22:25.416
Doesn't matter what they think.
as long as they can't prove it.

1048
01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:03.000
I fixed it.

1049
01:23:03.583 --> 01:23:05.666
Not properly.
You can still see a dent in the bumper.

1050
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:06.791
Are you sure?

1051
01:23:06.875 --> 01:23:10.083
You need to clean the grill with alcohol.
in case of any traces.

1052
01:23:10.166 --> 01:23:12.708
For all we know.
the police are on their way. Hurry!
