JOHN WALKER:
A female colleague posed
the question recently.

5
00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:36.036
It got me thinking.

6
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.603
Trusting to serendipity.
I stepped into my favourite

7
00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:40.736
bookstore where the muses
often guide me.

8
00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:46.872
After scanning the shelves.
destiny did reward me.

9
00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:48.961
Assholes: A Theory.

10
00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:51.964
I immediately took it to
the checkout counter.

11
00:00:55.707 --> 00:00:58.406
Within days I met with the
author Aaron James.

12
00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:01.626
philosophy professor and
life-long Californian surfer.

13
00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:03.889
I wanted to know what
inspired his book.

14
00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:11.114
AARON JAMES:
So while I was surfing here
I saw a guy surfing who was

15
00:01:11.245 --> 00:01:13.421
blatantly dropping in on
some of the other surfers.

16
00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:16.076
violating the rules of right
of way. and this person.

17
00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:18.252
when people would complain.
would get really angry and

18
00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:20.384
yell at them as a way
of getting waves.

19
00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:24.780
Surfers are definitely used
to having paradise spoiled

20
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.782
by crowds and the asshole
spoils it in

21
00:01:26.912 --> 00:01:28.305
a particularly
pronounced way.

22
00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:31.961
When I'm thinking this
guy is an asshole.

23
00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:35.182
I'm not just venting feelings.
I'm classifying him as of

24
00:01:35.312 --> 00:01:37.401
a certain type of
moral personality.

25
00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:40.404
When you use that word.
you're thinking of a type

26
00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:42.711
and Philosophers get interested
in this kind of thing.

27
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:44.930
But. then when I started
thinking it through the.

28
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:46.497
about the asshole concept.
I thought.

29
00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:48.282
"Oh. well. can't you
define the term?

30
00:01:48.412 --> 00:01:50.022
Isn't that a definable
term?"

31
00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:51.894
At that point. I started
thinking ok.

32
00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:53.678
this really a general
type. you know.

33
00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:56.159
it's not just a surfer
asshole concept.

There seems to be a lot more
assholes this year than any

36
00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.913
other year. especially
in the public eye.

37
00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:22.229
I'm not sure what's
going on.

38
00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.101
but we're overwhelmed
this year anyways.

JOHN WALKER:
We're doing a film based on the
book. Assholes: A Theory

40
00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:35.938
and the author's saying.
you know-

41
00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:38.070
MAN:
It's just not a theory.
it's a reality.

42
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:39.289
It's a reality?

43
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.596
Oh come on now. it's out
there. It's reality.

44
00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:45.295
The asshole as I define it is
the guy who allows himself

45
00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.167
special advantages in
cooperative life out of an

46
00:02:47.297 --> 00:02:48.864
entrenched sense
of entitlement

47
00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:50.431
that immunizes
him against the

48
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:52.172
complaints of other
people.

49
00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:56.132
AIMEÃ‰E MORRISON:
It's a great word to say.
"What an asshole."

50
00:02:56.263 --> 00:02:58.961
He's the guy who cuts in line
at the post office.

51
00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:01.529
taking a special advantage.
in cooperative life.

52
00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.184
You know. people are waiting in
line and they'll allow someone

53
00:03:04.314 --> 00:03:06.011
in for if they have
an emergency

54
00:03:06.142 --> 00:03:07.839
or if it's a pregnant
woman. right?

55
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.494
But this guy does it. takes
a special advantage

56
00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.192
for a different reason.

57
00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:14.411
You know. out of a sense
of entitlement.

58
00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:16.370
"Asshole." you can really
lean into it right?

59
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.110
"That guy is such
an asshole."

60
00:03:18.241 --> 00:03:20.200
And it could be any sense
of entitlement.

61
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.290
He thinks he's rich and his time
is more important than other

62
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.423
people. or he thinks he's
especially smart or beautiful.

63
00:03:26.554 --> 00:03:28.338
The euphony of the
word. right?

64
00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.776
It just feels good to say.
it sounds good to say.

65
00:03:31.907 --> 00:03:34.301
And the upshot of his being
entrenched in that sense

66
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:36.520
of entitlement is that he
won't listen to others

67
00:03:36.651 --> 00:03:38.740
when they complain.

68
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.351
ROBERT HOCKETT:
It was especially nice when he
added the word "entrenched."

69
00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:42.961
An entrenched sense
of self entitlement.

70
00:03:43.092 --> 00:03:44.659
that this is an
abiding problem.

71
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.052
That it is a sort of
deeply. it's very.

72
00:03:47.183 --> 00:03:49.925
it sort of goes down into the
bones almost of the person

73
00:03:50.055 --> 00:03:51.709
who has the problem.

74
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.581
PAUL PURCELL:
It's generally somebody
who says.

75
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:57.019
"Let's talk about my favourite
thing. me." generally. right.

76

What I do is more important than
you. Your feelings don't count.

79
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.206
You don't count. Your
work doesn't count."

00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:13.644
Assholes also like to
take all the credit.

81
00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:16.778
There's a teaming asshole
ecosystem and in it there are

82
00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:20.172
many different species.
many different varieties.

83
00:04:20.303 --> 00:04:22.740
For example. the boorish
asshole.

84
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:26.353
the smug asshole. the
self-aggrandizing asshole.

There's drunk assholes.

smug assholes. narcissistic
assholes.

87
00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:34.274
Well you gotta kind
of be a narcissist

88
00:04:34.404 --> 00:04:36.014
to be an asshole
anyways.

89
00:04:36.145 --> 00:04:38.190
The sexist asshole.

they'll have no problem doing

00:04:46.547 --> 00:04:48.157
it to everybody else
when they're around.

95
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:49.941

news asshole.

of traffic asshole as well.

There's no shortage. Out of any
kind of person in the world.

100
00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.566
there's more descriptive
kinds for an asshole

101
00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:07.307
to a normal person.
really.

102
00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:10.832
So. we're blessed I guess
with many kinds. [laughs]

That I am. never denied it.

105
00:05:17.142 --> 00:05:19.536
But at least I'm an
honest asshole.

DARTH HELMET:
I knew it. I'm surrounded
by assholes!

107
00:05:23.627 --> 00:05:28.066
Sometimes in comedy behaving a
bit like an asshole can be

108
00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:31.113
funny. we can laugh at that.
because it's not really serious.

Assholes in Aaron's book
and in the movies. yes.

115
00:05:55.746 --> 00:05:59.054
but I needed to investigate
their impact in the real world.

116
00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:01.361
So I hit the
streets of LA.

119
00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.149
And do you have
assholes in Mexico?

120
00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.151
Yeah. of course we do.

121
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:12.110
I believe that all countries
have assholes.

122
00:06:12.241 --> 00:06:14.635
I mean there's not one
country that you can say

123
00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:17.464
that there are not
assholes at all.

124
00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:20.728
WOMAN:
Privileged behaviour
is on the rise

125
00:06:20.858 --> 00:06:25.123
and people seem to think

126
00:06:25.254 --> 00:06:28.953
that it's ok to say and
do almost anything.

127
00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:32.304
They treat folks like
they're invisible

128
00:06:32.435 --> 00:06:35.917
and I think it's
so unfortunate.

129
00:06:36.047 --> 00:06:38.180
JOHN WALKER:
Have you had to deal
with assholes?

130
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.704

All the time. Everywhere
you go you have to.

131
00:06:40.835 --> 00:06:42.445
You have no choice.

There is assholes everywhere
like I told you.

133
00:06:45.274 --> 00:06:47.319
Yeah. every place.

You ever come across any?

135
00:06:49.104 --> 00:06:51.149
Uhhh...Not today.

everybody is a fucking asshole.

me. so.

JOHN WALKER:
What did you do?

140
00:07:06.338 --> 00:07:07.775
I flushed him down the toilet.

Goodbye!

142
00:07:10.865 --> 00:07:13.215
JOHN WALKER:
You have to deal with this
behaviour yourself?

143
00:07:13.345 --> 00:07:16.044
Like have you come
across it?I'm a big black guy.

144
00:07:16.174 --> 00:07:18.525
Most people don't bother me.
you know what I mean?

145
00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:21.005
If I look just
without smiling.

146
00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:23.094
WOMAN:
Well I think that
starts at home.

147
00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:25.662
It starts in the
beginning.

148
00:07:25.793 --> 00:07:28.665
Today's people
think it's ok

149
00:07:28.796 --> 00:07:31.015
that they don't have to
listen to nobody.

150
00:07:31.146 --> 00:07:32.800
If they don't respect
their parents.

151
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.366
they not gonna respect
anyone else.

152
00:07:34.497 --> 00:07:36.107
That's the way
I look at it.

153
00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:40.590
JOHN WALKER:
I met psychotherapist.
Suji Gelerman at home

154
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:42.810
on a break from
her LA office.

155
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.509
I asked her if LA was a
fertile ground for assholery.

156
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.598
SUJI GELERMAN:
Where are the assholes?

157
00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:52.384
Well. Hollywood has a large
percentage of assholes.

158
00:07:52.515 --> 00:07:54.125
MIRANDA:
You're an asshole!

159
00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:55.866
JIM:
I'm the asshole?
She's the asshole!

160
00:07:55.997 --> 00:07:58.216
She never called me once
after we broke up.

161
00:07:58.347 --> 00:07:59.914
CARRIE:
That's because
you're an asshole!

162
00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:02.525
I think there's a higher
percentage of narcissists

163
00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:05.441
feeling like assholes because
they just don't consider you.

164
00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:08.792
And in the way that Aaron
would be talking about

165
00:08:08.923 --> 00:08:13.144
that you have a certain kind
of moral high ground

166
00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:15.277
that you're better
than other people.

167
00:08:15.407 --> 00:08:17.932
Narcissists don't even
know there are other people.

168
00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:20.761
Okay. so If they don't know.
there's other people how can

169
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:24.939
they even really process the
fact that they're being mean

170
00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:29.683
to you or unforgiving.
or unkind. or negating.

171
00:08:29.813 --> 00:08:31.467
You don't really exist.

172
00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:33.600
JOEY:
Bitter self-righteous hag
who has no friends.

173
00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:38.996
KAT:
I guess in this society being
male and an asshole

174
00:08:39.127 --> 00:08:40.607
makes you worthy
of our time.

175
00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:44.785
The tyranny of assholdom. one
of the places that people don't

176
00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:47.527
talk that much about it is
body image for women.

177
00:08:47.657 --> 00:08:51.052
The tyranny of what it's like to
be a young woman in our society.

178
00:08:51.182 --> 00:08:54.882
an older woman an invisible old
women and how you're treated.

179
00:08:55.012 --> 00:08:57.885
how you're treated and people
treat you really poorly.

180
00:08:58.015 --> 00:09:00.844
Or young girls who aren't
the perfect body type.

181
00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:03.107
how that goes.

182
00:09:03.238 --> 00:09:05.327
You know. how you're talked
to. how you're bullied.

183
00:09:05.457 --> 00:09:07.590
how you're bullied
by other kids.

184
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:10.114
that to me is real asshole
behaviour.

185
00:09:10.637 --> 00:09:13.770
WOMAN:
Harvey Weinstein?
I think he's a perv.

186
00:09:13.901 --> 00:09:16.381
I think he's a perv and
an asshole. you know?

187
00:09:16.512 --> 00:09:19.602
I think he's been.
you know. again.

188
00:09:19.733 --> 00:09:24.215
it's when you got more money
than you think God has and you

189
00:09:24.346 --> 00:09:28.872
think you can treat people just
any way that you want to. yeah.

190
00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:30.526
I think that's sad.

191
00:09:32.397 --> 00:09:34.704
JOHN WALKER:
What kind of therapy do
you think Weinstein's

192
00:09:34.835 --> 00:09:36.401
going through right now?

193
00:09:36.532 --> 00:09:38.447
The pretense that I
read was. you know.

194
00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:40.144
he's got sexual addiction
problems.

195
00:09:40.275 --> 00:09:42.364
That's the least of his
problems is sexual addiction.

196
00:09:42.494 --> 00:09:44.496
I think he's just probably
licking his wounds

197
00:09:44.627 --> 00:09:46.977
and probably having people
around him who are willing to

198
00:09:47.108 --> 00:09:49.414
do what they always did.
which is suck up.

199
00:09:49.545 --> 00:09:52.243
I have worked with people and
the only reason the abuser's

200
00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:56.726
changed. was they truly saw
how it was created in them.

201
00:09:56.857 --> 00:09:59.207
what their behaviour was and
how destructive it was

202
00:09:59.337 --> 00:10:01.035
and wanting to change.

203
00:10:01.165 --> 00:10:03.428
Part of the asshole being
entrenched in entitlement is

204
00:10:03.559 --> 00:10:06.431
the idea that if they're a
proper asshole and not sort of

205
00:10:06.562 --> 00:10:10.958
borderline case. then that means
that I think it's extremely

206
00:10:11.088 --> 00:10:13.656
difficult for them to see that
there's a different. you know.

207
00:10:13.787 --> 00:10:15.615
maybe what they're doing
works for them.

208
00:10:15.745 --> 00:10:19.575
their deeply invested in it.
they're really are convinced.

209
00:10:19.706 --> 00:10:21.969
They really believe that
they're. you know.

210
00:10:22.099 --> 00:10:23.797
entitled and special
in these ways

211
00:10:23.927 --> 00:10:25.581
and that's very tough
to shake.

212
00:10:25.712 --> 00:10:29.803
ROBERT I. SUTTON:
I think that the reasons. at
least that assholes I think of.

213
00:10:29.933 --> 00:10:34.459
make us so angry. is that they
disrespect us as human beings.

214
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:37.854
They take away our dignity
from us. at least for me.

215
00:10:37.985 --> 00:10:40.683
I mean sometimes they will do
objectively bad things from us

216
00:10:40.814 --> 00:10:45.079
like take away money but. it's
this notion that when people get

217
00:10:45.209 --> 00:10:48.430
upset. it's they don't feel
dignified and respected

218
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.214
as a human being.

219
00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:52.042
[doorbell rings]

220
00:10:52.173 --> 00:10:55.089
[footsteps stomp]

221
00:10:55.219 --> 00:10:56.830
[door creaks]

222
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.570
[animal growl]

223
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:00.572
MAN:
Being an asshole
has a sort of

224
00:11:00.703 --> 00:11:02.749
like an edginess
to it. you know?

225
00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:06.317
Like when people say "Oh this
person is an asshole." it gets

226
00:11:06.448 --> 00:11:08.885
people thinking. it's like "Oh.
what's this person all about?

227
00:11:09.016 --> 00:11:10.887
Why is this person identified
as an asshole."

228
00:11:11.018 --> 00:11:13.107
and it opens the door
to let other people

229
00:11:13.237 --> 00:11:14.804
get to know you.
you know?

230
00:11:14.935 --> 00:11:17.807
It really puts the attention
on you. you know?

231
00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:19.896
I'm an attention whore.
I love seeking attention.

232
00:11:20.027 --> 00:11:23.421
MAN:
What wants to make me want to
be an asshole is just seeing

233
00:11:23.552 --> 00:11:25.467
everybody else. seeing what
they're getting in life

234
00:11:25.597 --> 00:11:28.339
and then seeing what I've gotten
in my life not being one.

235
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.167
it's a big difference.

236
00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:34.563
So. I've definitely learned from
my mistakes in that category

237
00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:38.480
and I've you know.
altered that. so.

238
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:43.224
Yeah. I think that's why I'm
choosing to be an asshole.

239
00:11:43.354 --> 00:11:45.922
MAN:
I. I feel like anyone who
legitimately considers himself

240
00:11:46.053 --> 00:11:47.924
an asshole isn't really
an asshole.

241
00:11:48.055 --> 00:11:51.580
I think it's like a person who
got hurt in high school so they.

242
00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:56.019
you know. "Now I'm a dick
in traffic" or whatever.

243
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.848
I think real assholes don't
realize they're assholes.

244
00:11:58.979 --> 00:12:03.897
An asshole is somebody who
ought to know better than to be

245
00:12:04.027 --> 00:12:07.204
as arrogant as he is and is
in some sense repressing.

246
00:12:07.335 --> 00:12:08.989
the information he has.

247
00:12:09.119 --> 00:12:11.948
In that sense. an asshole is
different from a prick who can

248
00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:13.733
know perfectly well
what's he's doing.

249
00:12:13.863 --> 00:12:17.475
The asshole tells himself it's
ok for one or another reason.

250
00:12:17.606 --> 00:12:20.783
That's one reason why for
example a five-year-old we might

251
00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:22.742
call a "little shit."
but we wouldn't call

252
00:12:22.872 --> 00:12:24.526
a five-year-old a
little asshole.

253
00:12:24.656 --> 00:12:26.136
You can't be an
asshole 'til

254
00:12:26.267 --> 00:12:27.877
you're old enough
to know better.

255
00:12:28.008 --> 00:12:30.314
Maybe about 14 you become
eligible for assholism.

256
00:12:30.445 --> 00:12:32.055
JOHN WALKER:
Can women be assholes?

257
00:12:32.186 --> 00:12:33.970
WOMAN:
Absolutely. Oh. anyone
can be an asshole.

258
00:12:34.101 --> 00:12:37.104
I guess in a way my mother
was an asshole...

259
00:12:37.234 --> 00:12:41.151
and if you'd said what mistakes
do you think you've made.

260
00:12:41.282 --> 00:12:45.634
I think she would have said.
"I really can't think of any."

261
00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:47.897
WOMAN:
But I prefer to be
called a dick.

262
00:12:48.028 --> 00:12:50.378
because it sounds cooler.
it's got more gusto.

263
00:12:50.508 --> 00:12:52.989
It seems that among the
assholes they are.

264
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.731
they tend to all group.
pile up on the male side

265
00:12:55.862 --> 00:12:57.733
of the gender divide.

266
00:12:57.864 --> 00:13:00.605
Oh yes. there's no question
it's mainly men.

267
00:13:00.736 --> 00:13:03.521
Assholes were by definition men.
but then I thought of certain

268
00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:06.437
examples. like Ann Coulter
for example.

269
00:13:07.525 --> 00:13:09.310
I'm sure there's others.
but I think

270
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.268
it's 99 percent of
them are men.

271
00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:13.096
JOHN WALKER:
Do you have any
favorite assholes?

272
00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:14.837
Favorite assholes?

273
00:13:14.968 --> 00:13:18.536
I am the number one most
impactful artist

274
00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:20.364
of our generation.

275
00:13:20.495 --> 00:13:23.977
Kanye. Kanye West is
a pretty big one.

276
00:13:24.107 --> 00:13:26.762
I am Shakespeare in the
flesh. Walt Disney.

277
00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:29.199
Nike. Google.

278
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.376
MAN:
Kanye West. he's a huge
idol of mine honestly.

279
00:13:32.507 --> 00:13:34.465
He just. he doesn't
work for anyone.

280
00:13:34.596 --> 00:13:37.207
MAN:
I really love the way Kanye's
outlook on the world.

281
00:13:37.338 --> 00:13:39.731
He's very well spoken
and does what he wants

282
00:13:39.862 --> 00:13:41.908
and doesn't care what
people say about him.

283
00:13:42.038 --> 00:13:44.693
Assholes are almost by
definition unhappy.

284
00:13:44.824 --> 00:13:48.001
There are people who say. "Oh
I'm an asshole and I have no

285
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:50.655
"qualms about it and I.
this is how I get ahead

286
00:13:50.786 --> 00:13:52.396
and so on and so forth."

287
00:13:52.527 --> 00:13:54.485
When you hear somebody
say unapologetically

288
00:13:54.616 --> 00:13:57.271
"I'm an asshole." he's almost
never an asshole. he's a dick.

289
00:13:58.663 --> 00:14:00.317
BRUCE:
Well. I can be an asshole.

290
00:14:00.448 --> 00:14:01.841
JACK:
No. Bruce you can't.

291
00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:06.976
You gonna pick
that up?

292
00:14:07.107 --> 00:14:08.499
Yeah. I'm sorry!

293
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.675
JOHN WALKER:
If someone admits to
being an asshole.

294
00:14:10.806 --> 00:14:11.938
they're not necessarily
an asshole.

295
00:14:12.068 --> 00:14:13.156
they're maybe a
temporary asshole.

296
00:14:13.287 --> 00:14:14.592
MAN:
Oh. I've been there.

297
00:14:14.723 --> 00:14:16.246
JOHN WALKER
We've all been there.

298
00:14:16.377 --> 00:14:19.119
I think I was there like
yesterday. or the week before.

299
00:14:19.249 --> 00:14:21.948
If you regret it later. or you
feel sorry. you know.

300
00:14:22.078 --> 00:14:24.733
then that's a sign that you're
not really entrenched in that.

301
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.083
And now. but that's a
different thing than someone

302
00:14:27.214 --> 00:14:30.217
being an asshole to you first
and then you trying to answer

303
00:14:30.347 --> 00:14:33.437
and kind of now. if you think.
that guy's an asshole now

304
00:14:33.568 --> 00:14:36.440
I have permission to just sort
of let my inner asshole out.

305
00:14:36.571 --> 00:14:39.313
you know. then that's an
asshole move. right?

306
00:14:39.443 --> 00:14:42.794
The nice guy doesn't get the
girl and the asshole does.

307
00:14:42.925 --> 00:14:44.971
That asshole never
keeps the girl.

308
00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:47.321
it's always the nice guy
who keeps the girl.

309
00:14:47.451 --> 00:14:49.801
but definitely for a one-night
stand or hooking up.

310
00:14:49.932 --> 00:14:51.542
the asshole definitely
gets it.

311
00:14:51.673 --> 00:14:55.503
Our confidence is just. it
extrudes more than the average

312
00:14:55.633 --> 00:14:57.374
person because we're so
confident in our self

313
00:14:57.505 --> 00:14:59.159
and girls love that.

314
00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:01.857
MAN:
Me and my buddies have
competitions where we go

315
00:15:01.988 --> 00:15:05.208
downtown LA and just see who can
pick up the most girls' numbers

316
00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:09.256
and at the end of the night. I
mean it's up to you if you want

317
00:15:09.386 --> 00:15:12.476
to text them. but. I personally
only text about 75 percent.

318
00:15:12.607 --> 00:15:15.001
or 25 percent of those
because. I mean.

319
00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:17.438
I don't even find most
of them attractive.

320
00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:21.442
Girls don't want a little
12-year-old kid. you know?

321
00:15:21.572 --> 00:15:23.531
They want someone who's
like a douche bag.

322
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:26.229
who you know. dresses
like he doesn't even care.

323
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.057
but he looks good.

324
00:15:28.188 --> 00:15:31.626
Someone that. you know just.
is cool. is an asshole.

325
00:15:31.756 --> 00:15:33.541
Girls dig that.

326
00:15:33.671 --> 00:15:38.981
OTTO:
You pompous. stuck up.
snot nosed.

327
00:15:39.112 --> 00:15:44.987
English. giant. twerp. scumbag.
fuck face. dickhead. asshole!

328
00:15:45.118 --> 00:15:46.989
How very interesting.

329
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.687
I always thought what I loved
about Canada is they

330
00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:51.298
never thought that they
were exceptional.

331
00:15:51.428 --> 00:15:54.040
You always get it
in old America.

332
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.346
you hear about American
exceptionalism.

333
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:01.395
It's four-year-olds believe
in exceptionalism. you know?

334
00:16:01.525 --> 00:16:04.311
They stand on the edge of
the pool and shout "Hey.

335
00:16:04.441 --> 00:16:08.445
daddy watch." and fall in the
pool and then come up as though

336
00:16:08.576 --> 00:16:10.317
they've invented a
cure for cancer.

337
00:16:10.447 --> 00:16:13.407
saying "Ahh look at me.
I fell in the pool."

338
00:16:13.537 --> 00:16:15.757
[organ music]

339
00:16:23.765 --> 00:16:26.550
I think Canadians in general
make terrible assholes because.

340
00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:28.161
you know. we're always
very nice.

341
00:16:28.291 --> 00:16:29.858
were always very agreeable.

342
00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.469
We always try and kinda
go along with the flow.

343
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.212
you know. and not really impose
our presence onto situations

344
00:16:36.343 --> 00:16:38.388
and I think that's whack.
that's terrible.

345
00:16:38.519 --> 00:16:41.609
We don't think of Canada
as producing assholes

346
00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:44.699
and it's because you're not as
insanely mindlessly competitive

347
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:46.788
as the Americans are.

348
00:16:46.918 --> 00:16:50.009
You actually understand how
to keep things in balance.

349
00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:55.666
JOHN WALKER:
Pesky. mean. asshole is
what you call a player

350
00:16:55.797 --> 00:16:58.234
like Brad Marchand when
he plays against your team.

351
00:16:58.365 --> 00:17:01.150
And a valuable player when
he's on your team.

352
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:03.022
COMMENTATOR:
The penalty here
by Brad Marchand.

353
00:17:03.152 --> 00:17:06.460
MAN:
In hockey being an asshole is
kinda part of the game.

354
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:09.637
Not everyone on the ice is an
asshole. but most people are.

355
00:17:09.767 --> 00:17:12.161
COMMENTATOR:
Just a little cross check and
then a turnaround spear.

356
00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:13.945
Right to the mid-section.

357
00:17:14.076 --> 00:17:15.773
COMMENTATOR 2:
Marchand's being
escorted out now.

358
00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:19.081
BRAD MARCHAND:
You know what. things happen in
hockey and I'm not really

359
00:17:19.212 --> 00:17:23.129
concerned how anyone really
feels outside of the room. so.

360
00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:26.784
I honestly could not give you an
answer on why you love assholes.

361
00:17:26.915 --> 00:17:29.222
it's just they're appealing
I guess. They're exciting.

362
00:17:29.352 --> 00:17:33.443
They're like. they give you.
it's almost like entertaining.

363
00:17:33.574 --> 00:17:35.750
There has been a serious
accusation from

364
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.318
the Toronto Star. that
I use crack cocaine.

365
00:17:38.448 --> 00:17:43.149
I do not use crack cocaine nor
am I an addict of crack cocaine.

366
00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:46.935
Assholes are people
who do things and

367
00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:50.286
say things that we might
want to say or like to

368
00:17:50.417 --> 00:17:53.724
imagine ourselves saying.
but would feel inhibited.

369
00:17:53.855 --> 00:17:56.510
or guilty about saying
and. in that sense.

370
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.687
there's a vicarious. I don't
want to say satisfaction.

371
00:17:59.817 --> 00:18:02.994
but interest in watching them
behave the way they do.

372
00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:06.128
which is why so many
of the characters

373
00:18:06.259 --> 00:18:10.263
who win our attention
are assholes.

374
00:18:10.393 --> 00:18:12.178
Yes. I have smoked
crack cocaine.

375
00:18:13.614 --> 00:18:15.224
REPORTER:
When sir?But no. do I?

376
00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:16.921
Am I an addict? No.

377
00:18:17.052 --> 00:18:18.662
Have I tried it?

378
00:18:18.793 --> 00:18:20.795
Probably in one of my
drunken stupors.

379
00:18:20.925 --> 00:18:23.363
JIMMY KIMMEL:
But I've realized is
Canadians are much.

380
00:18:23.493 --> 00:18:26.105
much weirder than any of us
had any idea they were.

381
00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:30.544
[audience applauds]

382
00:18:33.503 --> 00:18:35.679
JOHN WALKER:
Generally. Americans call
Canadians nice...

383
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.204
and ignore them.

384
00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:41.685
But elect an asshole to run
their largest city and late

385
00:18:41.816 --> 00:18:44.601
night hosts like Jimmy Kimmel.
empower them with stardom.

386
00:18:49.432 --> 00:18:52.783
The Canadian Prairies. known
for cooperative farming.

387
00:18:52.914 --> 00:18:55.699
was the last place I thought
I'd find entitled assholes.

388
00:18:57.092 --> 00:19:00.443
Yet Sherry Lee Benson-Podolchu.
found a particular breed.

389
00:19:00.574 --> 00:19:03.620
when she joined The Royal
Canadian Mounted Police.

390
00:19:05.753 --> 00:19:09.365
SHERRY BENSON-PODOLCHUK:
It was very much inducted right
from the very start to go along

391
00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.672
to get along and it
was a group thing;

392
00:19:11.802 --> 00:19:14.327
everybody has to
think the same.

393
00:19:14.457 --> 00:19:16.459
We always support each other.

394
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.418
The law is sacrosanct.

395
00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:20.594
Never lie.

396
00:19:20.724 --> 00:19:22.987
You follow your. the
detachment commander.

397
00:19:23.118 --> 00:19:26.426
whoever is your boss. whoever
is the senior officer without

398
00:19:26.556 --> 00:19:30.691
question and it's a systemic
problem of the going along

399
00:19:30.821 --> 00:19:32.649
to get along. protect
your own.

400
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:37.132
If you don't follow this. then
you'll be considered "the other"

401
00:19:37.263 --> 00:19:41.789
and then you are a target for
bullying and harassment.

402
00:19:41.919 --> 00:19:46.010
JOHN WALKER:
So what. what do you call this
kind of behavior that ensued?

403
00:19:46.141 --> 00:19:49.144
SHERRY BENSON-PODOLCHUK:
This is called asshole
behaviour and I know my Grandma

404
00:19:49.275 --> 00:19:51.059
would say that nice girls
don't say asshole.

405
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.756
but guess what Grandma?

406
00:19:52.887 --> 00:19:54.671
You didn't work for
the RCMP because

407
00:19:54.802 --> 00:19:58.371
there's a lot of assholes who
are wearing the Red Serge.

408
00:19:58.501 --> 00:20:00.286
who are pretending
to be leaders.

409
00:20:00.416 --> 00:20:02.331
when in fact they are
complete assholes.

410
00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:06.857
If way back in Tisdale when
a couple of officers thought

411
00:20:06.988 --> 00:20:10.121
it was funny to call me beaver
and raisin tits in the office

412
00:20:10.252 --> 00:20:12.472
and in front of everybody
and on the radio.

413
00:20:12.602 --> 00:20:16.389
if one other person would have
said "Hey man. shut the fuck up.

414
00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:19.087
don't talk to her like that.
you're just being an asshole."

415
00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:21.220
it would have ended
it. but no.

416
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.745
by not saying anything.
they allowed

417
00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:26.747
and condoned the behavior.

418
00:20:26.877 --> 00:20:28.792
What I needed from them.

419
00:20:28.923 --> 00:20:31.230
to trust them to protect
to help me.

420
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.928
was saying. "Hey man. don't
call her those names."

421
00:20:34.058 --> 00:20:37.714
If you have a leader
who is an asshole.

422
00:20:37.845 --> 00:20:40.978
the message is clear. this
is an asshole organization

423
00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:44.591
and it just ripples down into
everybody and their behavior

424
00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:48.203
towards each other or anyone
considered the "other."

425
00:20:48.334 --> 00:20:52.903
is that type of behavior and
if nobody says anything.

426
00:20:53.034 --> 00:20:56.167
and for all these years nobody
has been saying anything.

427
00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:58.039
it just continues.

428
00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:03.305
JOHN WALKER:
Sherry's trouble started
when she refused to lie

429
00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:05.612
in support of a
fellow officer.

430
00:21:05.742 --> 00:21:08.658
In a false statement. he
claimed his foot had slipped

431
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:11.008
on the gas when he rammed
a citizen's car.

432
00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:13.141
She knew he had been
drinking on the job.

433
00:21:15.796 --> 00:21:17.972
SHERRY:
The retaliation was quick.

434
00:21:18.102 --> 00:21:22.063
I went to get my gun out of my
gun belt and someone had gone in

435
00:21:22.193 --> 00:21:25.719
there and I had a blue gym bag
and in the blue gym bag

436
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:29.897
were my personal things and
there was a dead prairie chicken

437
00:21:30.027 --> 00:21:32.421
with blood dripping all over
my personal things.

438
00:21:33.814 --> 00:21:36.469
When you know that there's
people in the organization that

439
00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:39.994
are willing to cross that
line. it's very scary.

440
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.606
I decided that. you know.
just trying to handle this

441
00:21:43.737 --> 00:21:45.913
in-house isn't working.

442
00:21:46.043 --> 00:21:48.698
I have a leader who is
a complete asshole.

443
00:21:48.829 --> 00:21:51.875
totally ineffective and would
rather side with the bullies.

444
00:21:52.006 --> 00:21:54.922
the assholes. than stand
up for what is right.

445
00:21:55.052 --> 00:22:00.275
which was one woman and
several male officers.

446
00:22:00.406 --> 00:22:03.757
That was one of the pivotal
moments that I decided

447
00:22:03.887 --> 00:22:07.935
that I have to say something
and make a formal complaint.

448
00:22:08.065 --> 00:22:10.546
Yeah. it was
life changing.

449
00:22:12.243 --> 00:22:15.421
JOHN WALKER:
Sherry's sexual harassment
complaint enraged the RCMP.

450
00:22:15.551 --> 00:22:18.293
And it completely
disrupted her life.

451
00:22:18.424 --> 00:22:21.470
SHERRY:
I thought if I work
one more day.

452
00:22:21.601 --> 00:22:24.081
and I didn't know how
it was going to happen.

453
00:22:24.212 --> 00:22:27.258
but I just thought. if I go into
that building one more time.

454
00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:29.391
I just wouldn't.
I would die.

455
00:22:34.614 --> 00:22:38.008
They are actually willing to
commit criminal behaviour.

456
00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:41.577
They're willing to turn a blind
eye to violence against their

457
00:22:41.708 --> 00:22:45.059
coworkers just to protect
that workplace culture.

458
00:22:46.974 --> 00:22:49.977
and I left and I went
on medical leave

459
00:22:50.107 --> 00:22:51.892
for quite a while
after that.

460
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.549
Not everybody has that
sober second thought.

461
00:22:56.679 --> 00:23:00.770
I was lucky I did. but there's
many officers I know that don't.

462
00:23:00.901 --> 00:23:02.859
and they kill themselves
with their own gun

463
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.167
because they are bullied.
they're working with assholes.

464
00:23:06.297 --> 00:23:09.300
the assholes don't care about
them and it's all about

465
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:11.302
protecting the image and
protecting the way.

466
00:23:11.433 --> 00:23:13.087
'well. we've always
done it this way.

467
00:23:13.217 --> 00:23:16.090
this is the way we're
going to keep doing it.'

468
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:20.442
JOHN WALKER:
With no one listening and aware
she might not be the only one.

469
00:23:20.573 --> 00:23:24.446
Sherry went public with her
cause. the first to do so.

470
00:23:24.577 --> 00:23:28.407
SHERRY:
After my book came out. I was
out having lunch with another

471
00:23:28.537 --> 00:23:30.539
RCMP officer and he said.
"Well. you know Sherry.

472
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.411
"the RCMP hate you.

473
00:23:32.541 --> 00:23:35.675
"You know. your book didn't make
much of a scream in the press

474
00:23:35.805 --> 00:23:38.417
"and they were waiting to
see if anything happened.

475
00:23:38.547 --> 00:23:41.202
"and nothing did so now they
want to destroy you.

476
00:23:41.332 --> 00:23:43.509
"either ruin you financially
or drive you to suicide."

477
00:23:43.639 --> 00:23:46.599
And I took that as a
legitimate threat.

478
00:23:46.729 --> 00:23:49.036
SHERRY BENSON-PODOLCHUK:
Would they have done
something?

479
00:23:49.166 --> 00:23:51.604
I didn't know. but at
the time I felt that

480
00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:54.041
it was always a
possibility.

481
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:56.347
They don't obey the law.

482
00:23:56.478 --> 00:23:59.176
The two things
I was told to do.

483
00:23:59.307 --> 00:24:03.311
Never lie and always
follow the law.

484
00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:06.227
Well. they had violated
that all the time.

485
00:24:06.357 --> 00:24:09.099
Why wouldn't I think they could
do something to harm me?

486
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.145
Force me off the road?

487
00:24:11.275 --> 00:24:14.453
So it was a legitimate
feeling.

488
00:24:20.197 --> 00:24:22.809
JOHN WALKER:
After 20 years of no response
from government.

489
00:24:22.939 --> 00:24:25.942
media or fellow officers. the
flood gates finally open.

490
00:24:27.596 --> 00:24:30.773
A class action suit with over
3000 women's signatures

491
00:24:30.904 --> 00:24:32.688
is filed against the RCMP.

492
00:24:35.212 --> 00:24:37.606
Two years later the Federal
Government appoints

493
00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:39.347
the first female head
of the force.

494
00:24:47.616 --> 00:24:49.836

498
00:25:00.063 --> 00:25:04.503
I think human beings.
while very kind.

499
00:25:04.633 --> 00:25:07.201
many of them have a
tendency always

500
00:25:07.331 --> 00:25:09.769
to see how much they
can get in the world.

501
00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:12.336
I mean you see this with
toddlers who are like.

502
00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:14.425
you have to teach a
toddler to share

503
00:25:14.556 --> 00:25:16.079
because toddlers don't
want to share.

504
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.430
They. "it's me. it's me. it's
me. it's the thing that I want"

505
00:25:19.561 --> 00:25:23.347
and we train our young humans
out of this behaviour

506
00:25:23.478 --> 00:25:27.177
as they age and then there's
this. another stage when people

507
00:25:27.308 --> 00:25:29.528
are teenagers when they become
assholes again and it's

508
00:25:29.658 --> 00:25:31.878
developmentally appropriate just
the way it was for toddlers.

509
00:25:32.008 --> 00:25:34.881
where everyone wants what they
want and they want to have it

510
00:25:35.011 --> 00:25:37.318
and they don't much care for
other people's feelings.

511
00:25:37.448 --> 00:25:40.234
FILM NARRATOR:
Teenagers themselves are in
a natural state of change.

512
00:25:46.066 --> 00:25:48.285
Adults are astonished
and bewildered by

513
00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:51.071
the more outlandish of
today's teen fads.

514
00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:54.204
Almost categorically teenagers
are assholes.

515
00:25:54.335 --> 00:25:57.207
They're discovering
assholism. as it were.

516
00:25:57.338 --> 00:26:00.123
JOHN WALKER:
And we try to train
them out of it.

517
00:26:00.254 --> 00:26:04.171
Yeah. we do. we do try to train
them out of it or to teach them

518
00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:07.000
to repress it. more to the
point and some manage to

519
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.176
do that or manage to repress
those impulses.

520
00:26:09.306 --> 00:26:11.526
Others never
quite make it.

521
00:26:11.657 --> 00:26:14.616
Most teenagers flirt with kind
of an asshole phase.

522
00:26:14.747 --> 00:26:17.532
They're not really an asshole
in a sense of a

523
00:26:17.663 --> 00:26:19.273
stable trait of character.

524
00:26:19.403 --> 00:26:21.275
Some teenagers are going.
they're gonna graduate

525
00:26:21.405 --> 00:26:24.147
to being a proper asshole
as it were and others are.

526
00:26:24.278 --> 00:26:27.455
it's just a passing phase and
they're gonna grow out of it and

527
00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:29.675
ok. you know. the spell
breaks. you know. they.

528
00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:31.851
I don't know. go to
college and they're.

529
00:26:31.981 --> 00:26:36.203
have a sense of sort of peer
camaraderie and equality

530
00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:37.813
and there's some accountability
there and

531
00:26:37.944 --> 00:26:39.510
"Ok. maybe my parents
weren't so bad."

532
00:26:41.904 --> 00:26:44.515
JOHN WALKER:
As Aaron says. some teenagers
get over their sense

533
00:26:44.646 --> 00:26:47.693
of entitlement. others graduate
into the workforce with it.

534
00:26:48.824 --> 00:26:50.913
At Cornell. an Ivy League
University.

535
00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:54.177
I met Jonathan Gilmore. a
student and ex-marine

536
00:26:54.308 --> 00:26:56.310
with a keen sense of
empathy for others.

537
00:27:00.662 --> 00:27:03.273
Did you run into any asshole
behavior in the Military?

538
00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:06.233
JONATHAN GILMORE:
Yeah. oh yeah.

539
00:27:06.363 --> 00:27:08.322

Are you about to call
me an asshole?

JOKER:
Sir. no sir!

541
00:27:09.715 --> 00:27:12.413
I mean day one. like you get.
so boot camp's like.

542
00:27:12.543 --> 00:27:15.590
you know. three months of
dealing with the biggest

543
00:27:15.721 --> 00:27:17.331
assholes you've ever
met in your life.

544
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:19.028
I don't like the
name Lawrence!

545
00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:21.030
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence!

546
00:27:21.161 --> 00:27:23.554
I mean these guys are
screaming at you.

547
00:27:23.685 --> 00:27:25.644
calling you faggots. calling
you. you know.

548
00:27:25.774 --> 00:27:28.647
every name in the book
that's derogatory.

549
00:27:28.777 --> 00:27:31.650
and you know. physically
hurting you.

550
00:27:32.825 --> 00:27:34.609
The Marine Corps is a
brotherhood. right?

551
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.133
It's like a lot of people
would say it's arguably

552
00:27:37.264 --> 00:27:39.266
like the largest frat
in the United States.

553
00:27:39.396 --> 00:27:42.835
And so I figured. ok. if I go to
Cornell then what would be

554
00:27:42.965 --> 00:27:45.620
like the best decision? It
would to be join a fraternity.

555
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:47.796
I could have a brotherhood
again and I could

556
00:27:47.927 --> 00:27:49.624
connect with other people.

557
00:27:49.755 --> 00:27:52.671
So I was just like kind of
mingling around and figuring out

558
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:54.716
which fraternity I would
vibe with the best.

559
00:27:54.847 --> 00:27:58.285
and it was just like this.
you know that like.

560
00:27:58.415 --> 00:28:02.245
that just like super over macho
man masculine kind of like

561
00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:05.422
ugh. like you gotta poke your
chest out and like you gotta

562
00:28:05.553 --> 00:28:07.642
talk like this and like.
"What's up. bro."

563
00:28:07.773 --> 00:28:09.818
It was just this like
the film Animal House.

565

[rock music]

566
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.698
When I'm your older brother.
when I'm your big brother.

567
00:28:19.828 --> 00:28:22.309
I'm gonna belittle you. at
least for that first semester.

568
00:28:22.439 --> 00:28:25.138
you're gonna be my little bitch
and that to me just.

569
00:28:25.268 --> 00:28:27.183
that seems like huge asshole
behavior especially because

570
00:28:27.314 --> 00:28:30.491
they're like 18. 19-year-old
kids and they get just a little

571
00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:33.581
bit of power and of course
they're gonna run off with it.

572
00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:36.889
you know? Women are objectified
they're sexualized.

573
00:28:37.019 --> 00:28:39.979
It's the focus of the attention
is for all of the guys

574
00:28:40.109 --> 00:28:42.546
in the fraternities to get
as much sex as possible.

575
00:28:42.677 --> 00:28:44.810
Women are never main characters.
they're always pushed off

576
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.986
to the side and that's
fraternity life now.

577
00:28:47.116 --> 00:28:49.945
We were driving down the road.
it was a pretty dark night.

578
00:28:50.076 --> 00:28:52.818
there was a girl puking
on the side of the road

579
00:28:52.948 --> 00:28:55.168
and some guy was like
holding her hair back.

580
00:28:55.298 --> 00:28:58.562
As we went by. the guy in the
front seat. one of the

581
00:28:58.693 --> 00:29:01.348
fraternity members. he said. you
know. "Don't let me around her."

582
00:29:01.478 --> 00:29:03.567
Bad. like something like
"Don't let me around her.

583
00:29:03.698 --> 00:29:05.178
bad things will
happen to her."

584
00:29:05.308 --> 00:29:07.093
And I just thought
in my head.

585
00:29:07.223 --> 00:29:10.705
it kind of like set me back
a little bit and I just thought

586
00:29:10.836 --> 00:29:13.229
"Wait. is this guy saying that
he's gonna rape her

587
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.363
or like have sex with her?"
and so I asked him that.

588
00:29:16.493 --> 00:29:18.974
I was like. "Did you mean
that you're gonna sleep

589
00:29:19.105 --> 00:29:21.977
with the girl that's literally
puking on the side of the road?"

590
00:29:22.108 --> 00:29:24.545
And then he said something
like. "Well I would do

591
00:29:24.675 --> 00:29:26.765
what any other guy would
do in that circumstance."

592
00:29:26.895 --> 00:29:28.854
And I was just like
"No fucking way".

593
00:29:28.984 --> 00:29:31.770
and I asked them to pull over
and I got out.

594
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.989
That's what really set me
back about fraternities

595
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.992
in general cause I just felt
like. how is this so ok?

596
00:29:37.123 --> 00:29:39.081
How are people so ok
with this behavior?

597
00:29:39.212 --> 00:29:42.215
I mean you can't report that.
like what am I gonna do.

598
00:29:42.345 --> 00:29:45.348
call the cops and say "Hey.
this person said he might rape

599
00:29:45.479 --> 00:29:48.090
someone." but like what's worse
is that everybody around him was

600
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:51.224
totally ok with it and that to
me I think what even.

601
00:29:51.354 --> 00:29:53.922
cause you can have one asshole.
but then you've people

602
00:29:54.053 --> 00:29:56.185
supporting them and I think
those are almost like.

603
00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:58.187
that's like worse. Like
you know it's there.

604
00:29:58.318 --> 00:30:00.929
You know that guy's gonna do
that and you guys

605
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.845
won't do anything about it and
it's just like boosting his ego

606
00:30:03.976 --> 00:30:05.934
once again and that
guy's gonna get out

607
00:30:06.065 --> 00:30:08.241
and think that that's ok
and he'll find friends.

608
00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:10.547
They'll find plenty of people
who are totally accepting

609
00:30:10.678 --> 00:30:12.288
and willing to have
discussions like that.

610
00:30:13.899 --> 00:30:18.033
SHERRY F. COLB
They have. you know. lists of
the women they've slept with.

611
00:30:18.164 --> 00:30:21.950
that they write on the wall
and things like that and so

612
00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:26.041
I think a fraternity is
definitely a place where

613
00:30:26.172 --> 00:30:31.438
that sort of behavior can
be spread and made worse

614
00:30:31.568 --> 00:30:34.963
and maybe the thing to do
about it is for schools

615
00:30:35.094 --> 00:30:37.400
not to be affiliated
with fraternities.

616
00:30:37.531 --> 00:30:39.968
I think of those students
at Yale University.

617
00:30:40.099 --> 00:30:43.406
who. from a fraternity who
marched to the woman's dorm.

618
00:30:43.537 --> 00:30:48.890
Chanting. "no means yes.
yes means anal."

619
00:30:49.021 --> 00:30:54.330
And after the. uh. the
university disciplined them

620
00:30:54.461 --> 00:30:56.898
and so on. people were writing
this was an attack

621
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:59.161
on free speech and
so on and so forth

622
00:30:59.292 --> 00:31:03.383
and an astonishing way
to approach this.

623
00:31:03.513 --> 00:31:05.733
If it had happened
30 years earlier.

624
00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:07.430
nobody would have
of countenance it.

625
00:31:07.561 --> 00:31:09.693
They just would have been
out on their ear.

626
00:31:09.824 --> 00:31:13.349
not because of the
anti-feminism.

627
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.134
just because of the
vulgarity of it.

628
00:31:15.264 --> 00:31:17.832
[water crashes]

629
00:31:19.747 --> 00:31:22.750
JONATHAN GILMORE:
These kids are gonna graduate
and they're gonna go out into

630
00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:25.318
the world and they're gonna
take what they learned from

631
00:31:25.448 --> 00:31:27.320
this fraternity and they're
gonna. put it wherever

632
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:29.496
they have. or wherever they.
you know. work at.

633
00:31:31.628 --> 00:31:33.892
These are like people who have
been attending these

634
00:31:34.022 --> 00:31:37.069
fraternities since. you know.
like early. like late 1800's and

635
00:31:37.199 --> 00:31:40.072
the money within them. like
especially at the top frats.

636
00:31:40.202 --> 00:31:42.813
I mean it's millions and
millions and millions

637
00:31:42.944 --> 00:31:45.468
of dollars that these people
are kind of like coming into.

638
00:31:46.992 --> 00:31:49.777
And I think because of that
power. that it's nearly

639
00:31:49.908 --> 00:31:53.085
impossible to change.
not even just change.

640
00:31:53.215 --> 00:31:55.957
but to like obviously get rid
of the system in general.

641
00:31:56.088 --> 00:31:58.699
These are rich white dudes that
have been running these things

642
00:31:58.829 --> 00:32:00.788
for years and years
and years and years

643
00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:03.182
and I don't think that's gonna
change anytime soon.

644
00:32:03.312 --> 00:32:08.535
I had a student and he was
very disrespectful.

645
00:32:08.665 --> 00:32:11.190
disruptive and so I just
stopped calling on him.

646
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.497
So he came to my office hours
which I knew he would do

647
00:32:14.628 --> 00:32:18.110
and he said. "I'm really upset
because you don't call on me."

648
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.896
so I said "I don't call on you
because I don't appreciate

649
00:32:22.027 --> 00:32:25.639
your interventions in the
classroom." And he said.

650
00:32:25.769 --> 00:32:29.469
"I think you're just put off
because I'm a very manly man."

651
00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:31.471
So I said "No. that's
not it."

652
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:35.040
So I said. "What I'd like you to
do is when you have something

653
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.346
"useful to say. raise
your hand and say it.

654
00:32:37.477 --> 00:32:40.871
If you have something petty and
annoying to say. don't."

655
00:32:41.002 --> 00:32:44.179
and. you know we sort. I sort
of went through it kind of.

656
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:47.313
and I had no hopes that this
would have any effect.

657
00:32:48.618 --> 00:32:52.187
Starting the next day. he
became a model student

658
00:32:52.318 --> 00:32:54.885
and he ended up getting
an A+ on the exam.

659
00:32:55.016 --> 00:33:00.065
It was just amazing and he came
to my office after the course

660
00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:04.286
was over and he said. "I just
want to thank you because no one

661
00:33:04.417 --> 00:33:09.204
had ever told me that what I
was doing was a problem."

662
00:33:09.335 --> 00:33:12.686
I think many of us figure
what's the point.

663
00:33:12.816 --> 00:33:16.081
Like why bother. but if we
bother then this person

664
00:33:16.211 --> 00:33:18.344
is likely to hear it more
than once. right?

665
00:33:18.474 --> 00:33:20.476
If they. if they're
abusive.

666
00:33:20.607 --> 00:33:22.739
If someone tells them and
someone else might

667
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.654
tell them too. maybe they
start thinking.

668
00:33:24.785 --> 00:33:27.440
"you know. maybe. you know.
maybe they've got a point."

669
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:33.011
He was well on his way to being
that CEO who was abusive to

670
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:35.665
everybody and thought that
anyone who objected was just.

671
00:33:35.796 --> 00:33:38.581
you know. didn't like his
manliness or whatever it was.

672
00:33:40.453 --> 00:33:51.855
[clock tower rings]

673
00:33:51.986 --> 00:33:53.814
JOHN WALKER:
Cornell Law professors
like Sherry.

674
00:33:53.944 --> 00:33:56.208
are concerned about
asshole behavior.

675
00:33:56.338 --> 00:33:58.862
They monitor their
students and have adopted

676
00:33:58.993 --> 00:34:01.822
a 'no asshole rule' when
hiring in their department.

677
00:34:01.952 --> 00:34:05.043
PROFESSOR:
I assume everybody doesn't
like assholes.

678
00:34:05.173 --> 00:34:08.524
JOHN WALKER:
Today's conference is on how
the law can play a role

679
00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:12.093
in governing assholery. from
Washington to Wall Street.

680
00:34:12.224 --> 00:34:15.314
SAULE OMAROVA:
The financial services industry
in my view and I don't think

681
00:34:15.444 --> 00:34:19.535
I'm alone here is a
quintessential asshole industry.

682
00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:25.237
Well. when you think about that
pervasiveness of systematically

683
00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:30.198
asshole type behavior in
a particular social venue.

684
00:34:30.329 --> 00:34:34.637
For example. the financial
services industry. right?

685
00:34:34.768 --> 00:34:41.209
Then the problem of managing
assholes becomes a structural

686
00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:46.823
problem in which law can
potentially have a lot of say.

687
00:34:46.954 --> 00:34:50.305
So if we make certain types of
asshole behavior systemically.

688
00:34:50.436 --> 00:34:55.049
unprofitable for example.
irrational.

689
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:58.531
something that is not rewarding.
then that behavior

690
00:34:58.661 --> 00:35:03.492
will naturally kind of fall away
and overall the system

691
00:35:03.623 --> 00:35:07.888
will become less prone to being
overtaken by a bunch of assholes

692
00:35:08.018 --> 00:35:11.152
that continue to pursue their
own private goals.

693
00:35:11.283 --> 00:35:13.850
their own insatiable appetites
for private gain

694
00:35:13.981 --> 00:35:17.202
at the expense of the rest of
us. the rest of the society.

695
00:35:17.332 --> 00:35:20.509
You know the people who were
over-speculating on Wall Street

696
00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.252
in the 1920's. just as those
before 2008 were acting in

697
00:35:24.383 --> 00:35:27.951
individually rational manners.
but that individual rationality

698
00:35:28.082 --> 00:35:30.563
kinda morphs into a
kind of assholery.

699
00:35:30.693 --> 00:35:33.174
The only way to deal with a
collective action problem

700
00:35:33.305 --> 00:35:35.655
of this sort. is through an
exercise of collective agency.

701
00:35:35.785 --> 00:35:37.396
right? You need a
collective agent.

702
00:35:37.526 --> 00:35:40.225
I think of this as a sort of
orchestra conductor. right?

703
00:35:40.355 --> 00:35:45.099
Somebody who sort of oversees
and takes measures that makes it

704
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:48.189
no longer individually rational
to do the asshole thing.

705
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.236
The Central Bank is that
collective agent.

706
00:35:56.328 --> 00:35:58.460
JOHN WALKER:
Colleagues. Robert and
Aaron share a concern

707
00:35:58.591 --> 00:36:00.506
about asshole capitalism.

708
00:36:00.636 --> 00:36:04.205
After the 2008 financial crisi.
Robert was an organizer

709
00:36:04.336 --> 00:36:06.207
of the Occupy Wall Street
movement.

710
00:36:06.338 --> 00:36:08.296
Sleeping at night under a
blanket at headquarters

711
00:36:08.427 --> 00:36:10.603
in Zuccotti Park.

712
00:36:10.733 --> 00:36:13.127
In the morning. he walked
across the street

713
00:36:13.258 --> 00:36:15.608
to his day job at the New York
Federal Reserve.

714
00:36:18.219 --> 00:36:23.006
After the crash in 2008. they
admirably started to worry

715
00:36:23.137 --> 00:36:25.748
about group think
inside the Fed

716
00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:28.360
as regulators and so they
decided that they wanted to

717
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:32.190
bring in somebody who would sort
of be a contrarian voice and

718
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.757
help them identify. you know.
mistakes they were making

719
00:36:34.888 --> 00:36:38.283
or new things they can do
and so they brought in Bob.

720
00:36:38.413 --> 00:36:40.110
There was a consensus. a
regulatory consensus

721
00:36:40.241 --> 00:36:42.983
here in the States in the
lead up to the crisis.

722
00:36:43.113 --> 00:36:45.246
that you can't really spot a
bubble developing when

723
00:36:45.377 --> 00:36:47.074
it's developing and some
people were saying

724
00:36:47.205 --> 00:36:49.381
there isn't a bubble. They
just can't exist. right?

725
00:36:49.511 --> 00:36:52.210
That seems to me was dead
wrong. Dead wrong that they

726
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.734
can't exist. to say that. Of
course they occur. right?

727
00:36:54.864 --> 00:36:56.866
The next thing I thought
is you can

728
00:36:56.997 --> 00:36:58.477
actually spot them
in develpment.

729
00:36:58.607 --> 00:37:01.567
This is not a very controversial
position now. but at the time.

730
00:37:01.697 --> 00:37:04.047
of course. it was very much
against the consensus view.

731
00:37:04.178 --> 00:37:05.745
Like all these recursive
collective actions problems.

732
00:37:05.875 --> 00:37:07.137
they're sort of self-augmenting.

733
00:37:07.268 --> 00:37:09.009
there's a snowball like
character to them.

734
00:37:09.139 --> 00:37:11.272
They make themselves worse
until the credit runs out.

735
00:37:11.403 --> 00:37:14.188
That's what was going on
in the lead up to 2008.

736
00:37:14.319 --> 00:37:17.409
That was going on in the
lead up to 1929. as well.

737
00:37:17.539 --> 00:37:20.629
It's nonsense I think to say you
can't spot that sort of thing

738
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.065
happening in advance.

739
00:37:22.196 --> 00:37:24.285
Unfortunately. many American
regulators in the lead up to

740
00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:26.896
2008 did think that you couldn't
spot them in advance.

741
00:37:27.027 --> 00:37:31.249
The Feds failure to understand
its role as a collective agent

742
00:37:31.379 --> 00:37:34.774
meant to sort of orchestrate
doings on Wall Street.

743
00:37:34.904 --> 00:37:37.777
To act as a kind of a
conductor of Wall Street.

744
00:37:37.907 --> 00:37:43.870
In the 1920's. almost directly
brought us the calamity that was

745
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.307
the Second World War. the
calamity that was the Nazi

746
00:37:46.438 --> 00:37:48.309
rise to power in Germany.

747
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.659
The calamity that was the
Holocaust and the like.

748
00:37:52.226 --> 00:37:55.577
It's a very tight
direct link.

749
00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:58.363
I actually think if there hadn't
been the bubble and bust

750
00:37:58.493 --> 00:38:01.235
in this country in the
20's. I don't think that

751
00:38:01.366 --> 00:38:03.498
the Nazi party ever would
have become anything more

752
00:38:03.629 --> 00:38:05.848
than a fringe party in Germany.
in that time.

753
00:38:05.979 --> 00:38:08.590
There's certainly no reason to
think that it would have been

754
00:38:08.721 --> 00:38:10.505
because. or would have
done. because it.

755
00:38:10.636 --> 00:38:13.856
there was never any sign of its
getting out of the fringes until

756
00:38:13.987 --> 00:38:16.555
the crash and until the German
economy plummeted too because

757
00:38:16.685 --> 00:38:18.600
it was so completely dependent
on the American economy.

758
00:38:18.731 --> 00:38:20.472
in the 1920's.

759
00:38:20.602 --> 00:38:23.388
AARON JAMES:
I don't know what it is. but
something about this

760
00:38:23.518 --> 00:38:25.085
place makes me think
of assholes.

761
00:38:25.215 --> 00:38:27.130
ROBERT HOCKETT:
Yeah. I know what you mean.

762
00:38:27.261 --> 00:38:28.915
There's a distinct
air of it here.

763
00:38:29.045 --> 00:38:31.091
Yeah. a very poignant
sort of pungency to it.

764
00:38:33.528 --> 00:38:37.271
The most foul mouthed people
are the investment bankers

765
00:38:37.402 --> 00:38:41.536
and I'm sure that when you
go see things like Wolf.

766
00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:43.756
what is it. the
Wolf of Wall Street.

767
00:38:43.886 --> 00:38:46.498
you know. that language is
typical of the language

768
00:38:46.628 --> 00:38:48.500
they actually use
all the time.

769
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:51.546
Very vulgar. Very harsh.

770
00:38:51.677 --> 00:38:55.333
Very assertive.

771
00:38:56.769 --> 00:38:58.336
JORDAN:
It was like mainlining
adrenaline.

772
00:38:58.466 --> 00:39:01.426
STOCKBROKER:
Yeah fuck face. look at where
the stocks at today. huh?

773
00:39:01.556 --> 00:39:03.558
STOCKBROKER:
Pick up the cock sucking phone!

774
00:39:03.689 --> 00:39:04.820
JORDAN:
Sorry.

775
00:39:04.951 --> 00:39:07.040
I would describe that
a Hedge Fund as the.

776
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:09.434
as an asshole factory.

777
00:39:09.564 --> 00:39:12.567
You know. just churning them out
in large numbers because

778
00:39:12.698 --> 00:39:15.831
once you've got a horrible
group of people together.

779
00:39:15.962 --> 00:39:18.530
then all they want to do is
choose other horrible people

780
00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:20.706
to join them. You see
what I mean?

781
00:39:20.836 --> 00:39:23.578
So that when you get an asshole
culture they're in trouble

782
00:39:23.709 --> 00:39:26.189
because inevitably they're gonna
flourish more and people are

783
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.018
gonna become asses because they
think it's the right to do.

784
00:39:29.149 --> 00:39:32.326
I think there are some people
who almost make the choice

785
00:39:32.457 --> 00:39:35.329
and over a long period of
time become assholes

786
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.766
when they probably didn't
start out as them.

787
00:39:37.897 --> 00:39:41.248
They play a shell game with
money and lawyers and all the

788
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:45.383
strange stuff and. you know.
it's like the mortgage crisis.

789
00:39:45.513 --> 00:39:47.950
They were just packaging stuff
and selling little pieces of

790
00:39:48.081 --> 00:39:50.431
crap and smashing them together
and calling them Triple A.

791
00:39:50.562 --> 00:39:52.302
It's like. and I'm
not saying that

792
00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:54.130
there aren't assholes
everywhere.

793
00:39:54.261 --> 00:39:56.089
they're just a special
kind of asshole.

794
00:39:56.219 --> 00:39:58.570
MARK:
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

795
00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.267
No.

796
00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:03.575
He thinks he's getting shit
rich. which he is. on paper.

797
00:40:03.705 --> 00:40:07.056
But you and me. the brokers.
we're taking home cold hard cash

798
00:40:07.187 --> 00:40:09.189
via commission motherfucker!

799
00:40:09.319 --> 00:40:11.539
Right.

800
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:14.890
It is completely legitimate
and normal

801
00:40:15.021 --> 00:40:20.113
and not a sign of weakness to
really worry and care about

802
00:40:20.243 --> 00:40:23.682
those amongst us who are less
fortunate and who need help

803
00:40:23.812 --> 00:40:26.772
and if you remove that
kind of notion from

804
00:40:26.902 --> 00:40:30.036
the collective consciousness.
then you would encourage people

805
00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:32.560
to adopt this other extreme
where. 'you know what.

806
00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:36.608
I'm only going to care about
myself' and frequently the

807
00:40:36.738 --> 00:40:39.437
rationalization that comes with
it is that well that's because.

808
00:40:39.567 --> 00:40:44.093
you know. I'm owed more
than anybody else

809
00:40:44.224 --> 00:40:45.878
or at the very least.

810
00:40:46.008 --> 00:40:48.315
I don't care what other
people get in the bargain.

811
00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:50.230
It's their own problem.

812
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.102
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

813
00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:55.453
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

814
00:40:55.583 --> 00:40:57.672
And so if all we
care about

815
00:40:57.803 --> 00:41:01.633
is just individual
self-interested success.

816
00:41:01.763 --> 00:41:05.680
if we assume that if everybody
pursues their self-interest.

817
00:41:05.811 --> 00:41:08.509
without any restraints.
somehow automatically then

818
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.729
our society will always
be better off.

819
00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:14.472
then we will have a society
in which that notion will morph

happens. we're rich.

[thunder crashes]

828
00:41:45.024 --> 00:41:48.418
BILL EMMOTT:
I think that when you elect an
asshole to run your country.

829
00:41:48.549 --> 00:41:50.899
what you get is someone who
frames everything around their

830
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:52.684
own needs. around their
own desires

831
00:41:52.814 --> 00:41:54.773
and their maintenance
in power.

832
00:41:55.643 --> 00:41:57.950
You basically elected
someone whose there

833
00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.780
to preserve themselves.
to protect themselves.

834
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:06.872
to enrich themselves and thinks
of the world as being one that

835
00:42:07.002 --> 00:42:09.614
operates according to the degree
to which you can enrich others

836
00:42:09.744 --> 00:42:12.355
who will support your
power. not the public.

837
00:42:12.486 --> 00:42:17.012
but your supporters and by all
of its instruments that give

838
00:42:17.143 --> 00:42:21.103
rise to equality. particularly
the Rule of Law that might

839
00:42:21.234 --> 00:42:24.890
otherwise impinge on that
selfish person's instincts.

840
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.676
get undermined. bit by bit.
steadily. steadily. steady.

841
00:42:28.807 --> 00:42:31.592
And that's what happened
with Silvio Berlusconi.

842
00:42:31.723 --> 00:42:34.726
in particularly his second and
third times in Government.

for tax fraud.

Silvio Berlusconi. media
tycoon. football team owner

848
00:42:49.436 --> 00:42:51.830
and former Prime Minister
has dominated

849
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:54.702
the Italian imagination
for over 30 years.

850
00:43:01.448 --> 00:43:03.624
Would Berlusconi be a good
example of an asshole?

851
00:43:05.147 --> 00:43:07.062
EDOARDO ALBINATI:
Ah. yeah. sure. yes.

852
00:43:08.194 --> 00:43:12.372
A very. good example and
an exceptional one.

853
00:43:12.502 --> 00:43:19.074
so. a real great. nice asshole
for many reasons.

854
00:43:19.205 --> 00:43:24.993
Assholes are so often admired by
others and they are leaders.

855
00:43:25.124 --> 00:43:32.087
they are the funniest people
in your class and I had.

856
00:43:32.218 --> 00:43:39.007
I remember the funniest people
in school were the assholes.

857
00:43:39.138 --> 00:43:41.923
The good people
usually are flat.

858
00:43:42.054 --> 00:43:49.409
I'm sorry to say that. but it's
also like this in cinema.

859
00:43:49.539 --> 00:43:55.850
or movies. or in life. to
the example of Berlusconi

860
00:43:55.981 --> 00:43:58.244
is again a perfect one.

861
00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.900

Berlusconi burst onto
the public stage.

862
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:04.946
as the owner of the first
private network of TV stations

863

Filmmaker and activist
Lorella Zanardo considers

865
00:44:13.563 --> 00:44:16.305
Berlusconi's seductive
television and media empire

866
00:44:16.436 --> 00:44:18.481
the source of his
rise to power.

867
00:44:21.049 --> 00:44:23.225
LORELLA ZANARDO:
At the beginning of the '80's.

868
00:44:23.356 --> 00:44:27.186
Berlusconi's TV started
to broadcast.

869
00:44:27.316 --> 00:44:30.363
[Lorealla speaks Italian]

870
00:44:30.493 --> 00:44:33.018
and TV changed completely
because

871
00:44:33.148 --> 00:44:37.239
they started to offer
programs where the focus

872
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:41.940
was on beautiful and
very feminine girls.

873
00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:45.770
nearly naked. but
never naked.

874
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.861
which is very Italian
and men. older.

875
00:44:49.991 --> 00:44:54.039
much older than these girls.
telling the stupid stories.

876
00:44:54.169 --> 00:44:58.608
laughing with the camera
always on part of the bodies

877
00:44:58.739 --> 00:45:02.003
of these girls and these girls
were many. many girls

878
00:45:02.134 --> 00:45:07.705
with the idea was that with
these girls. you at home.

879
00:45:07.835 --> 00:45:12.013
had. could. have no problems
in life because it was fun.

880
00:45:12.144 --> 00:45:16.583
they were so erotic.
so nice. so ready

881
00:45:16.714 --> 00:45:20.326
to accept man with
no problems.

882
00:45:20.456 --> 00:45:26.593
[Italian music]

883
00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:31.163
LORELLA ZANARDO:
Statistics say that
Italians. have two to three

884
00:45:31.293 --> 00:45:36.168
TV sets in every house
in the Northern part

885
00:45:36.298 --> 00:45:39.519
and in the Southern part
they have never a job.

886
00:45:39.649 --> 00:45:42.740
three to four TV set
in every apartment.

887
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:47.483
so these programs were entering
not every house. every room.

888
00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:52.488
So. it was quite powerful and
that period we didn't have.

889
00:45:52.619 --> 00:45:57.537
computer or smart
phone. internet.

890
00:45:57.667 --> 00:46:01.759
so every room had this TV set
with Berlusconi entering

891
00:46:01.889 --> 00:46:06.024
and telling the story. telling
all these wonderful world.

892
00:46:06.154 --> 00:46:13.379
made of wonderful. nice girls
ready to love Italian men.

893
00:46:14.728 --> 00:46:18.863
Nine years ago we had the
horrible scandal of Berlusconi

894
00:46:18.993 --> 00:46:22.518
and his dinner party
with girls and Ruby

895
00:46:22.649 --> 00:46:24.782
and everybody was saying
"Oh. it's horrible!"

896
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.741
Why it's horrible?

897
00:46:27.872 --> 00:46:30.700
It's exactly what we watch
every day since 30 years.

898
00:46:31.963 --> 00:46:33.921
Like a Fellini dream. ah?

899
00:46:34.052 --> 00:46:35.793

it real.

fountain Trevi.

for you. smiling.

"come here."

Life is easy. It's a dream.

906
00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:05.866
Berlusconi made it real and
he understood in a way

907
00:47:05.997 --> 00:47:09.522
that Italians wanted
this dream.

908
00:47:14.744 --> 00:47:17.747
TIM PARKS:
Italy's immensely
open to assholery.

909
00:47:17.878 --> 00:47:22.013
There is a desire for
a protective figure.

910
00:47:22.143 --> 00:47:25.973
There's a desire for what
the Italian's call a "Baroni".

911
00:47:26.104 --> 00:47:28.715
a person in charge. the person
who decides everything.

912
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:31.109
a Godfather. head
of the family.

913
00:47:31.239 --> 00:47:35.417
There's a desire for
a figure who will.

914
00:47:35.548 --> 00:47:39.682
you know. find you a job. keep
you in a job. make things ok.

915
00:47:39.813 --> 00:47:43.425
TIM PARKS:
Make it so that you don't
have to worry

916
00:47:43.556 --> 00:47:46.994
and Berlusconi has very ably
presented himself as that

917
00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:49.301
and I'm sure he actually
feels the emotions

918
00:47:49.431 --> 00:47:50.868
of the person in
that role.

919
00:47:53.218 --> 00:47:55.394
BILL EMMOTT:
I think Berlusconi was
the original populist

920
00:47:55.524 --> 00:47:57.570
at least in a European
context.

921
00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.834
He got to power
and built up

922
00:48:00.965 --> 00:48:04.272
his support by essentially
promising to feed the

923
00:48:04.403 --> 00:48:08.842
inner-selfishness of all sorts
of groups in Italian society

924
00:48:08.973 --> 00:48:13.629
showing his own entrepreneurial
business success.

925
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.939
his wealth. his girlfriends. his
parties and so forth as proof of

926
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:22.769
what you can achieve if only you
let your selfishness fly free.

927
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.815
So he promised all
sorts of goodies

928
00:48:25.946 --> 00:48:30.864
to those people who supported
him and under that cover.

929
00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:34.215
having put himself in power.
managed to enrich himself.

930
00:48:34.346 --> 00:48:38.306
We will remember this horrible
period of life

931
00:48:38.437 --> 00:48:43.529
not for the bad people. but
people who are considered good

932
00:48:43.659 --> 00:48:45.879
but they were silent.

933
00:48:47.794 --> 00:48:52.146
So. Berlusconi's an asshole?
Yes. We too.

934
00:48:54.366 --> 00:48:56.542
It's a country of assholes.

935
00:48:56.672 --> 00:48:58.805
Why people haven't
stopped him.

936
00:48:58.936 --> 00:49:01.939
Why people haven't.
why politician haven't.

937
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:05.855
done a law in order
to stop him?

938
00:49:05.986 --> 00:49:08.641
What has happened
to us. witchcraft?

939
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:11.296
I mean 60 million people.

940
00:49:11.426 --> 00:49:13.863
JOHN WALKER:
At least one person
tried to stop him.

941
00:49:13.994 --> 00:49:17.041
Supreme Court judge
Piercamillo Davigo.

942
00:49:17.171 --> 00:49:20.609
who famously said "The
politicians haven't stopped

943
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.482
stealing. they have stopped
being ashamed."

944
00:49:56.994 --> 00:50:00.345
I think that the big effect of
having assholes in charge is to

945
00:50:00.475 --> 00:50:03.826
kind of numb. anesthetize.

946
00:50:03.957 --> 00:50:08.005
the sensitivity of the body
politic to behaviour.

947
00:50:08.135 --> 00:50:12.574
to bad behaviour such
that. criminality.

948
00:50:12.705 --> 00:50:17.275
theft. simple selfishness
becomes norm.

949
00:50:17.405 --> 00:50:21.018
normal and indeed I think
the great terrible thing

950
00:50:21.148 --> 00:50:24.238
that happened in Italy was
a shrugging of our shoulders

951
00:50:24.369 --> 00:50:27.024
and saying. "Cusci van tutti."

952
00:50:27.154 --> 00:50:28.590
"Everyone is doing
this and therefore.

953
00:50:28.721 --> 00:50:30.114
well. it can't
be that bad."

954
00:50:33.769 --> 00:50:36.816
JOHN WALKER:
Nostalgia for the past seems to
be the script Populist leaders

955
00:50:36.946 --> 00:50:38.426
like Berlusconi follow.

956
00:50:39.819 --> 00:50:43.127
Setting back the clock. ignorig
shifting social values.

957
00:50:43.257 --> 00:50:46.130
selling asshole behavior as
the triumphant way forward.

958
00:50:50.134 --> 00:50:54.138
But we don't all act like sheep
for example. Vladimir Luxuria.

959
00:50:54.268 --> 00:50:59.882
VLADIMIR LUXURIA:
I remember when I was at school
once. the teacher asked me.

960
00:51:00.013 --> 00:51:06.411
"Do you like men or do you like.
or do you prefer women?"

961
00:51:08.065 --> 00:51:13.200
And since I was sincere I said I
like men and he said come here

962
00:51:13.331 --> 00:51:17.378
and I went next to him. in
front of all the other students

963
00:51:17.509 --> 00:51:22.253
and he had a stick and he beat
the stick on my hand

964
00:51:22.383 --> 00:51:25.778
as a punishment so that
anyone could see.

965
00:51:26.213 --> 00:51:31.000
Now it would be considered
illegal. but.

966
00:51:31.131 --> 00:51:35.614
when I was a child it was
considered so normal. so normal.

967
00:51:36.832 --> 00:51:40.662
To be a man at least in the time
in which I was educated.

968
00:51:40.793 --> 00:51:43.709
was to show that you
are not a woman.

969
00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:46.755
to show that you are not a
girl. Don't be a girl.

970
00:51:46.886 --> 00:51:51.108
Don't be girlish. in
sport. in whatever.

971
00:51:51.238 --> 00:51:53.458
Also. don't cry.
you're not a girl.

972
00:51:55.068 --> 00:51:57.026
EDOARDO ALBINATI:
Football is not a
sport for girls...

973
00:51:59.855 --> 00:52:02.380
but the problem is that
the male identity.

974
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.818
this kind of identity.
traditional one has not been

975
00:52:05.948 --> 00:52:07.472
substituted by
anything else

976
00:52:08.951 --> 00:52:13.521
and so the old model
is collapsed.

977
00:52:13.652 --> 00:52:17.612
but there is not a new
model of a man.

978
00:52:17.743 --> 00:52:24.228
Especially at school. all the
time I had people insulting me.

979
00:52:24.358 --> 00:52:29.755
writing bad words about
me on the books.

980
00:52:29.885 --> 00:52:36.370
pissing on my shoes in the
gym hour. but at that time.

981
00:52:36.501 --> 00:52:41.375
they led me to think that they
were right and I was wrong.

982
00:52:41.506 --> 00:52:45.988
So many act of violence.
of aggressiveness.

983
00:52:46.119 --> 00:52:53.082
including rape I think I tend
to interpret them as a sort of

984
00:52:53.213 --> 00:53:00.264
trying to restore the old
order. the old regime.

985
00:53:00.394 --> 00:53:06.574
Only when I was 16-years-old and
for the first time I went to

986
00:53:06.705 --> 00:53:10.622
a big city. a big town in Milan
and I went to a gay discotheque

987
00:53:10.752 --> 00:53:15.801
and I saw people like me having
fun. drinking. dancing.

988
00:53:15.931 --> 00:53:20.109
I realized that no.
there is another opportunity.

989
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.417
You can be what you are and
be happy at the same time;

990
00:53:23.548 --> 00:53:25.376
have fun.

991
00:53:25.506 --> 00:53:31.251
So I began to think. so. these
people were not the right people

992
00:53:31.382 --> 00:53:32.948
they were assholes.

993
00:53:33.079 --> 00:53:35.081
Because they were trying
to ruin my life

994
00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:42.131
and so from that time
I decided not to obey to

995
00:53:42.262 --> 00:53:45.396
what they were saying
but to fight them.

996
00:53:46.571 --> 00:53:48.964
[parliament applauds]

997
00:53:49.095 --> 00:53:55.841
VLADIMIR LUXURIA:
I was elected in the Italian
Parliament in 2006 until 2008.

998
00:53:55.971 --> 00:53:58.974
I remember Berlusconi.

999
00:53:59.105 --> 00:54:06.243
Berlusconi. he was closing
all his reunions.

1000
00:54:06.373 --> 00:54:12.727
you know. in the squares.
saying this as the last words.

1001
00:54:12.858 --> 00:54:18.733
"Do you want that in Italy
people like Vladimir Luxuria

1002
00:54:18.864 --> 00:54:21.432
would be elected into
Parliament?"

1003
00:54:21.562 --> 00:54:26.437
And all his fans were shouting
"No!" but I was elected.

1004
00:54:28.613 --> 00:54:31.659
JOHN WALKER:
Well into Berlusconi's regime
the Economist magazine decided

1005
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:33.879
to challenge his outrageous
governance.

1006
00:54:34.009 --> 00:54:36.838
Bill Emmott was the
chief editor at the time.

1007
00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.408
Yes. it was worth that attention
because of the potential of

1008
00:54:41.539 --> 00:54:44.063
the same behavior moving
into other countries.

1009
00:54:44.193 --> 00:54:47.066
into France. into Britain. into
the United States into

1010
00:54:47.196 --> 00:54:49.286
all over the Western world.

1011
00:54:49.416 --> 00:54:54.639
So it became a kind of case
study. in what could happen

1012
00:54:54.769 --> 00:55:01.080
in a new mediatic world where
assholedom could be amplified

1013
00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:05.737
and sadly we have seen it
spread into other countries.

1014
00:55:05.867 --> 00:55:10.307
Had he come to political
maturity at the time of Twitter.

1015
00:55:10.437 --> 00:55:12.134
of social media.

1016
00:55:12.265 --> 00:55:14.746
I think he would have used
Twitter and social media

1017
00:55:14.876 --> 00:55:18.445
because again. as subsequent
characters have shown us.

1018
00:55:18.576 --> 00:55:21.840
it provides a way to give
a direct communication

1019
00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:26.061
to the people unfiltered by
the rest of the media.

1020
00:55:27.672 --> 00:55:30.631
JOHN WALKER:
The free flow of information
has always been the US mantra.

1021
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:34.766
It's given American tech
companies an unregulated

1022
00:55:34.896 --> 00:55:37.856
freedom to profit from
addictive software.

1023
00:55:37.986 --> 00:55:40.641
abuse of our privacy and
corporate monopolies

1024
00:55:40.772 --> 00:55:42.208
with unprecedented power.

1025
00:55:43.296 --> 00:55:45.646
Silicon Valley is really
interesting.

1026
00:55:45.777 --> 00:55:49.781
It's breeding a so to speak
a new variety of asshole.

1027
00:55:49.911 --> 00:55:54.829
People who believe that in
virtue of having accumulated

1028
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:59.007
enormous amounts of money or in
virtue of being on the cusp

1029
00:55:59.138 --> 00:56:01.140
of accumulating enormous
amounts of money.

1030
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:06.232
they're entitled to ignore the
ordinary sanctions that attach

1031
00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:08.060
to behaving in
certain ways.

1032
00:56:12.934 --> 00:56:16.024
MARK ZUCKERBERG:
We're all here because we're
optimistic about the future.

1033
00:56:17.156 --> 00:56:19.593
We have real challenges
to address.

1034
00:56:19.724 --> 00:56:23.380
but we need to keep that
sense of optimism too.

1035
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:26.208
AARON JAMES:
Zuckerberg is. you know.
another case in which.

1036
00:56:26.339 --> 00:56:29.777
you know. 'move fast and break
things.' was a slogan for

1037
00:56:29.908 --> 00:56:32.824
a while and he explains it as.
well he doesn't want his

1038
00:56:32.954 --> 00:56:34.869
creative people to be tied
up with perfectionism.

1039
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.958
you know. they should
be free to fail

1040
00:56:37.089 --> 00:56:38.960
and sort of move on
to other things.

1041
00:56:39.091 --> 00:56:41.049
Not following the herd
or being. you know.

1042
00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:43.008
completely opposed to
everything that came before

1043
00:56:43.138 --> 00:56:45.750
and you can see how that
would lead to assholery. right?

1044
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.621
It really does. It
sort of says.

1045
00:56:47.752 --> 00:56:49.754
"Dude. you don't care what
other people think.

1046
00:56:49.884 --> 00:56:52.583
"You don't care about the way
that it's always been done.

1047
00:56:52.713 --> 00:56:54.802
"You know. you're charging
forward towards the future and

1048
00:56:54.933 --> 00:56:57.326
the future is going to break
everything from the past."

1049
00:56:57.457 --> 00:56:59.372
I mean it sounds like
a rampaging toddler.

1050
00:56:59.503 --> 00:57:01.287
If a consequence of Facebook.
'moving fast

1051
00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:03.855
and breaking things.' is that it
breaks democracy or democracy

1052
00:57:03.985 --> 00:57:06.771
becomes a shell and the
historic march of democracy

1053
00:57:06.901 --> 00:57:10.992
is ended and we have a
resurgence of authoritarianism

1054
00:57:11.123 --> 00:57:13.995
and sort of papered over
formality democracy.

1055
00:57:14.126 --> 00:57:15.867
That's not something
that can be undone.

1056
00:57:15.997 --> 00:57:18.130
That's not something that
further technological change

1057
00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.524
is going to repair
or fix. you know?

1058
00:57:20.654 --> 00:57:24.789
It's not something that
would ever justify.

1059
00:57:24.919 --> 00:57:26.617
you know. Zuckerberg's.
you know.

1060
00:57:26.747 --> 00:57:29.750
aggressive growth policy and.
you know. lack of care.

1061
00:57:29.881 --> 00:57:33.058
MARK ZUCKERBERG:
It's clear now that we didn't
do enough to prevent these

1062
00:57:33.188 --> 00:57:35.190
tools for being used
for harm as well.

1063
00:57:35.321 --> 00:57:37.976
And that goes for fake news.
for foreign interference

1064
00:57:38.106 --> 00:57:40.500
in elections and hate speech
as well as developers

1065
00:57:40.631 --> 00:57:42.241
and data privacy.

1066
00:57:42.371 --> 00:57:44.417
Each apology seems very
sincere. right?

1067
00:57:44.548 --> 00:57:47.289
He really means it. I mean he
knows how to apologize.

1068
00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.205
That's not something assholes
usually know how to do. right.

1069
00:57:50.336 --> 00:57:53.644
But. you know. it's the same
really good apology over and

1070
00:57:53.774 --> 00:57:56.429
over again without. you know.
sort of the action you would

1071
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:58.300
think if the previous ones
really were sincere.

1072
00:57:59.867 --> 00:58:03.349
We didn't take a broad enough
view of our responsibility and

1073
00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:08.180
that was a big mistake and it
was my mistake and I'm sorry.

1074
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:11.313
You know. if things really
do go for the worse.

1075
00:58:11.444 --> 00:58:14.186
as bad as they can go
now for the U.S.

1076
00:58:14.316 --> 00:58:17.755
and for other countries
then Zuckerberg what?

1077
00:58:17.885 --> 00:58:19.757
"Oops." You know?

1078
00:58:19.887 --> 00:58:23.587
It's like "oops". you know.
it's not excusable. right?

1079
00:58:23.717 --> 00:58:25.719
It's not just an innocent
mistake.

1080
00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:28.635
LESLIE MILEY:
The fact of the matter is.
we've been putting assholes

1081
00:58:28.766 --> 00:58:30.855
in charge of companies
for the last 25 years

1082
00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:33.118
and very young assholes.

1083
00:58:33.248 --> 00:58:36.469
20-something-year-old.
privileged. for the most part.

1084
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.472
white men who don't know
their behavior is

1085
00:58:39.603 --> 00:58:41.996
the behavior of an asshole.

1086
00:58:42.127 --> 00:58:45.260
BETHANYE MCKINNEY BLOUNT:
If you work in Silicon Valley
and you have never dealt with

1087
00:58:45.391 --> 00:58:49.438
an asshole. you've probably
never done anything that's

1088
00:58:49.569 --> 00:58:51.876
that hard and you're
probably a white guy.

1089
00:58:52.006 --> 00:58:54.661
Like those two things are
probably true at the same time.

1090
00:58:54.792 --> 00:58:56.968
Nothing against being
a white guy. that's.

1091
00:58:57.098 --> 00:59:00.101
but I think you need to have
both those things be true

1092
00:59:00.232 --> 00:59:03.365
for you to be like "Oh no. I've
never dealt with an asshole

1093
00:59:03.496 --> 00:59:05.367
in Silicon Valley."
Really? You haven't?

1094
00:59:05.498 --> 00:59:07.195
Mmhmmhmm. I don't believe you.

1095
00:59:07.326 --> 00:59:09.328
Tech is. from a cultural
standpoint.

1096
00:59:09.458 --> 00:59:13.071
is still stuck in
the brogramming.

1097
00:59:13.201 --> 00:59:15.943
you know. me. me.
me. me culture.

1098
00:59:16.074 --> 00:59:17.597
JOHN WALKER:
You said brogramming?

1099
00:59:17.728 --> 00:59:19.730
Brogramming is this
concept of guys.

1100
00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.645
you know. particularly
men. males.

1101
00:59:21.775 --> 00:59:25.170
young males getting together to
create the next big thing.

1102
00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:28.913
I would explain to people
that I was a woman.

1103
00:59:29.043 --> 00:59:32.003
but I had. also if you were
going to compare me to

1104
00:59:32.133 --> 00:59:34.353
the various types of nerds
you wanted to overlay.

1105
00:59:34.483 --> 00:59:37.008
I was like "no. I'm basically
like the bare-footed.

1106
00:59:37.138 --> 00:59:39.750
"neck beard guy in the corner
with five monitors who doesn't

1107
00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:42.404
"talk to anybody and works
all night. Like. that's me

1108
00:59:42.535 --> 00:59:45.146
That's who I am. I just
don't look like that guy."

1109
00:59:45.277 --> 00:59:47.192
So there's always
been some like.

1110
00:59:47.322 --> 00:59:51.283
"you're not enough" exclusivity
that's been cultivated.

1111
00:59:51.413 --> 00:59:53.198
I've always been fascinated.

1112
00:59:53.328 --> 00:59:57.942
that the great inventors
in IT are nerds.

1113
00:59:59.291 --> 01:00:01.859
Because why would you want
to spend all your life.

1114
01:00:01.989 --> 01:00:04.557
you know what I mean. fiddling
around with little bits of.

1115
01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:06.385
and see what's happening
on the screen.

1116
01:00:06.515 --> 01:00:08.648
probably 'cause you don't
terribly much enjoy

1117
01:00:08.779 --> 01:00:10.476
other people's company.

1118
01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.653
So. I. it's terribly great
that we have these people.

1119
01:00:13.784 --> 01:00:15.568
and that they make these
great discoveries.

1120
01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:18.397
but I think the great mistake
is to listen to them

1121
01:00:18.527 --> 01:00:21.269
when they start telling
us how we should live.

1122
01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.577
And let's be honest. If you
give a 24-year-old 10 million.

1123
01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.710
20 million. 50 million. a
hundred million dollars

1124
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.451
in funding. do you really expect
them to have good behavior

1125
01:00:29.582 --> 01:00:32.106
all the time? Do you
not expect to change

1126
01:00:32.237 --> 01:00:35.588
who and what they are and
how they approach things?

1127
01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:37.634
You've just given somebody
who's really done nothing

1128
01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:40.201
in their life. like their entire
life. they've done nothing.

1129
01:00:40.332 --> 01:00:41.986
now they have a hundred
million dollars.

1130
01:00:42.116 --> 01:00:43.814
that's just going to enable
bad behavior.

1131
01:00:43.944 --> 01:00:46.120
I think that the effect
of the platforms.

1132
01:00:46.251 --> 01:00:50.995
Twitter. Facebook and other
social media platforms on us is

1133
01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:55.695
to basically give vent to the
worst aspects of our nature.

1134
01:00:56.827 --> 01:00:58.872
It gives us a platform
to be bigoted.

1135
01:00:59.003 --> 01:01:00.874
It gives us a platform
to be prejudiced.

1136
01:01:01.005 --> 01:01:03.485
It gives us a platform to
sound off on people.

1137
01:01:03.616 --> 01:01:05.444
It gives us a platform
to abuse people.

1138
01:01:05.574 --> 01:01:08.273
Now. we had those already.

1139
01:01:08.403 --> 01:01:11.189
they were called bars and we
said what we thought about

1140
01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:14.322
people in bars. but the point
about social media is that it

1141
01:01:14.453 --> 01:01:18.413
gives the potential to amplify
those voices on a huge scale.

1142
01:01:18.544 --> 01:01:20.415
And that's a new phenomenon.

1143
01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:24.071
The New Yorker had a cartoon
in the '90's you may remember.

1144
01:01:24.202 --> 01:01:27.031
LESLIE MILEY:
It was two dogs at a
computer and it said.

1145
01:01:27.161 --> 01:01:29.163
"On the internet. no one
knows you're a dog."

1146
01:01:30.599 --> 01:01:33.211
[Leslie laughs]

1147
01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:36.040
So. it is so appropriate
to today

1148
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:41.262
and I do think that the
ability to launch an attack.

1149
01:01:41.393 --> 01:01:44.265
an anonymous attack
against people

1150
01:01:44.396 --> 01:01:47.834
has kind of like really lowered
the expectations of behavior.

1151
01:01:47.965 --> 01:01:51.838
Probably the strongest assholes
in contemporary world

1152
01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:54.188
are the social haters.

1153
01:01:54.319 --> 01:01:55.929
JOHN WALKER:
Trolls.

1154
01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.932
Haters. I think I prefer
haters. yeah.

1155
01:01:59.063 --> 01:02:01.979
So. it's a way of. it's the
easiest way of hate.

1156
01:02:03.371 --> 01:02:10.335
I had the opportunity with an
Italian TV program. Le lene.

1157
01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:13.555
to meet one of
my assholes.

1158
01:02:16.428 --> 01:02:19.474
JOHN WALKER:
Mary Sarnartaro is a renowned
stand-up comedian

1159
01:02:19.605 --> 01:02:23.304
and host of Le Iene.one of
Italy's most popular TV shows.

1160
01:02:23.435 --> 01:02:24.958
MARY SARNARTARO:
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

1161
01:02:26.264 --> 01:02:28.440
JOHN WALKER:
Her job. is chasing
after assholes.

1162
01:02:30.268 --> 01:02:36.230
For the program Le lene.
I try to...assholes.

1163
01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:37.884
JOHN WALKER:
Squish?

1164
01:02:38.015 --> 01:02:39.843
Squish assholes. yes.

1165
01:02:39.973 --> 01:02:41.670
JOHN WALKER:
You're hunting assholes?

1166
01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:43.411
Yes. si. si.

1167
01:02:58.252 --> 01:03:06.260
If you have a camera for them.
it's as you have a gun.

1168
01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:11.048
A man who was writing
to me all the time.

1169
01:03:11.178 --> 01:03:15.792
"I want you to hang. I will
give you the rope.

1170
01:03:15.922 --> 01:03:18.142
"Why don't you kill yourself?

1171
01:03:18.272 --> 01:03:20.057
"I will give you the gun.

1172
01:03:20.187 --> 01:03:21.885
"You are a fag.

1173
01:03:22.015 --> 01:03:25.453
You're not a man. or
you're not a woman."

1174
01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:27.281
All the time. all the time.

1175
01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:39.598
I was in the car.
they cheated him.

1176
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.864
VLADIMIR LUXURIA:
The TV program say that it was
going to meet another person

1177
01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:47.432
of the TV even though
it was me.

1178
01:03:51.653 --> 01:03:53.133
[Mary speaks Italian]

1179
01:03:54.656 --> 01:03:57.442
[both speak Italian]

1180
01:03:57.572 --> 01:03:59.357
MAN:
Vladimir Luxuria?

1181
01:03:59.487 --> 01:04:02.316
He became pale. he
began to tremble.

1182
01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:05.842
he didn't know what to say and
I said. "You know who I am?"

1183
01:04:05.972 --> 01:04:08.757
And he said. "Oh. yes. I know.
you're Vladimir Luxuria."

1184
01:04:08.888 --> 01:04:11.978
"No. I am the person
who should hang.

1185
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:14.328
I am the person who should
kill himself."

1186
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:39.788
VLADIMIR LUXURIA:
At the end of the story.
I understood that this.

1187
01:04:39.919 --> 01:04:46.273
this boy was just. in
Italian we say "sfigato".

1188
01:04:46.404 --> 01:04:51.975
he's just a poor guy.
miserable and not.

1189
01:04:52.105 --> 01:04:54.368
he doesn't. he does not
have a girlfriend.

1190
01:04:54.499 --> 01:04:59.286
he. problems in the family.
problems at school.

1191
01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:02.115
I had pity on him. you know.
I would say.

1192
01:05:02.246 --> 01:05:07.816
so. I'm sure that all the
people who are asshole.

1193
01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:10.907
actually they have
their own problems.

1194
01:05:11.037 --> 01:05:12.909
you know. they have
their own problems.

1195
01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:18.218
JOHN WALKER:
Once you've exposed a troll.
are they finished?

1196
01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:19.959
Continue to be a troll?

1197
01:05:20.090 --> 01:05:21.656
Uh. no. they continued.

1198
01:05:21.787 --> 01:05:23.267
JOHN WALKER:
Ah.Yes.

1199
01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:24.921
Sometimes they
finish. sometimes.

1200
01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:27.924
but. more times
they continue.

1201
01:05:28.054 --> 01:05:30.491
It's almost impossible to stop
terrible behavior online because

1202
01:05:30.622 --> 01:05:33.364
as soon as you block
a troll. right.

1203
01:05:33.494 --> 01:05:36.367
another one springs up and
as soon as you try to enact

1204
01:05:36.497 --> 01:05:38.195
a structural means of
blocking trolls.

1205
01:05:38.325 --> 01:05:41.067
where you say like some kinds
of speech are acceptable and

1206
01:05:41.198 --> 01:05:44.157
some are unacceptable. there are
whole mobs will rise up yelling

1207
01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:46.812
"Free speech. free speech.
liberty!"

1208
01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:50.207
Now imagine if all you are
doing is talking to

1209
01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:53.862
your Alt-right friends. or
your white supremacist friends

1210
01:05:53.993 --> 01:05:56.909
and you're only sharing articles
and you're only sharing

1211
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.085
information and you're only
sharing the things that

1212
01:05:59.216 --> 01:06:01.435
you believe in and that
inflame your passions.

1213
01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:05.135
and you do this for days and
weeks and months at a time.

1214
01:06:06.658 --> 01:06:08.747
You're going to feel
very emboldened.

1215
01:06:08.877 --> 01:06:11.532
You know. you. you know. we talk
about the radicalization.

1216
01:06:11.663 --> 01:06:13.665
it was like "How was this
person radicalized?"

1217
01:06:13.795 --> 01:06:16.755
I mean it's not just Islam where
people get radicalized. right?

1218
01:06:16.885 --> 01:06:19.366
It's white supremacists
get radicalized.

1219
01:06:19.497 --> 01:06:21.325
It's. you know.
anti-abortion people get.

1220
01:06:21.455 --> 01:06:22.979
you know. become radicalized.

1221
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:24.806
Radicalized? Yeah.
radicalized.

1222
01:06:24.937 --> 01:06:27.287
You know. even Black Lives
Matter people get radicalized.

1223
01:06:28.593 --> 01:06:31.465
They all do if they stay
in that echo-chamber.

1224
01:06:31.596 --> 01:06:35.339
Well. I think we do need to do a
lot of work on that right now.

1225
01:06:35.469 --> 01:06:37.776
yeah...

1226
01:06:37.906 --> 01:06:47.655
because all the media we
have invites us to feel

1227
01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:53.792
extremely righteous and to be
utterly sure of our own position

1228
01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:58.449
and not to pay too much
attention to the other guys

1229
01:06:58.579 --> 01:07:01.626
and to allow ourselves to
be led towards showdowns

1230
01:07:01.756 --> 01:07:05.630
which are clearly not in
anybody's interest.

1231
01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.285
It's frightening that we had
an entire group of people

1232
01:07:08.415 --> 01:07:11.070
think that. a population of
people that think that Obama

1233
01:07:11.201 --> 01:07:14.421
was born in Kenya based
upon social media.

1234
01:07:15.988 --> 01:07:19.165
I mean it's like. I hate to
give. you know. anybody credit.

1235
01:07:19.296 --> 01:07:21.515
but alternative facts
are real. right.

1236
01:07:21.646 --> 01:07:23.387
and wow. there's
a statement.

1237
01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:25.737
alternative facts are real.
they're real for some people

1238
01:07:25.867 --> 01:07:28.914
and how do you combat
that? I don't know.

1239
01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:33.527
I mean. I really hope that
Reddit and Facebook and

1240
01:07:33.658 --> 01:07:36.922
Twitter get a handle on it and
Google gets a handle on it

1241
01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:41.970
because if people don't know
what's real they're only gonna

1242
01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:44.799
evoke their emotions and
they're never gonna vote and

1243
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:49.065
they're never going to engage in
a conversation that can be moved

1244
01:07:49.195 --> 01:07:52.981
forward because it's not based
on fact and that's where.

1245
01:07:53.112 --> 01:07:55.027
that's the world we're
living in right now

1246
01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:57.247
which is a world increasingly
not based upon fact

1247
01:07:57.377 --> 01:07:59.858
and that should
concern us all.

1248
01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:04.080
MAN:
Modern assholeness is a failure
of communication.

1249
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:07.300
It's very making
communication one sided

1250
01:08:07.431 --> 01:08:11.261
so there's not like a
dialogue going on.

1251
01:08:11.391 --> 01:08:16.135
It's very top down
kind of like.

1252
01:08:16.266 --> 01:08:17.745
you are speaking down
to everyone.

1253
01:08:17.876 --> 01:08:19.530
like it's sort of like...

1254
01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.533
I was about to say being an
asshole is sort of like

1255
01:08:22.663 --> 01:08:24.752
bullying. but I mean I
guess it is bullying.

1256
01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:26.580
like it's the same thing.

1257
01:08:26.711 --> 01:08:30.062
Like I said. I have a lot of
followers and I live my life

1258
01:08:30.193 --> 01:08:32.325
by "If you don't have
anything to benefit me.

1259
01:08:32.456 --> 01:08:34.458
then I most likely
won't talk to you."

1260
01:08:34.588 --> 01:08:38.331
I have a lot of people reach out
to me to either like be my

1261
01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:41.943
friend or like work with me and
stuff and I always look at their

1262
01:08:42.074 --> 01:08:44.903
following or just who they're
surrounded with and if I don't

1263
01:08:45.033 --> 01:08:49.168
think that they can benefit me.
I 100 percent won't talk to you.

1264
01:08:49.299 --> 01:08:52.084
It's about eyeballs. right and
if you keep people engaged in

1265
01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:54.478
your platform. you're not gonna
do something to stop them.

1266
01:08:55.653 --> 01:08:58.395
I can. I am going to make
a very bold statement

1267
01:08:58.525 --> 01:09:00.223
backed up with no
facts whatsoever.

1268
01:09:00.353 --> 01:09:03.095
Facebook could eliminate 90% of
their fake news tomorrow.

1269
01:09:04.923 --> 01:09:07.143
It would hit their revenue
in such a way

1270
01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:09.362
that it would send their
stock price crashing.

1271
01:09:09.493 --> 01:09:11.321
What do you do?

1272
01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:15.107
That's the dilemma.

1273
01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:17.544
The same thing with Twitter.
Same thing with Google.

1274
01:09:20.721 --> 01:09:24.203
I think those organizations
have a responsibility

1275
01:09:24.334 --> 01:09:26.031
that they have abrogated.

1276
01:09:27.946 --> 01:09:30.601
JOHN WALKER:
Silicon Valley's freedom to
break things without regard

1277
01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:33.038
to its' social impact.
may come to an end.

1278
01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.476
When Washington calls on
CEO's like Zuckerberg

1279
01:09:36.607 --> 01:09:39.175
to face inquiries. it's clear
they are concerned.

1280
01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:44.615
Google's CEO on the other
hand. refused to attend

1281
01:09:44.745 --> 01:09:47.400
his government's inquiry.
sending lawyers instead.

1282
01:09:50.534 --> 01:09:54.320
The European Union took action.
suing Google 5 billion dollars.

1283
01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:56.453
for anti-trust violations.

1284
01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:59.064
It remains to be seen.
if US regulators

1285
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.979
will follow the
European lead.

1286
01:10:02.285 --> 01:10:05.940
Why is it happening in Europe
and not in Washington?

1287
01:10:06.071 --> 01:10:09.161
Well. of course these are
American companies

1288
01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:12.208
and therefore. European
regulators are a bit more

1289
01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:13.861
inclined to push back
against them.

1290
01:10:13.992 --> 01:10:17.691
but also they are not subject to
the same political donation

1291
01:10:17.822 --> 01:10:22.566
influence that the Washington
authorities are.

1292
01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:25.569
Google has become the biggest
campaign finance donor

1293
01:10:25.699 --> 01:10:30.574
in congressional elections in
the latest couple of cycles.

1294
01:10:30.704 --> 01:10:32.793
Facebook is also a big donor.

1295
01:10:32.924 --> 01:10:35.187
The European commission
is immune to such

1296
01:10:35.318 --> 01:10:37.537
direct financial influence.

1297
01:10:38.843 --> 01:10:40.627
JOHN WALKER:
Regulating this corporate
entitlement

1298
01:10:40.758 --> 01:10:43.500
with Silicon Valley or Wall
Street companies is a challeng.

1299
01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:48.244
Here at Baird. a multinational
wealth management

1300
01:10:48.374 --> 01:10:50.550
and equity firm with
client investments

1301
01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:52.857
of 77 billion dollars.

1302
01:10:52.987 --> 01:10:54.902
Their philosophy is carved
into the woodwork:

1303
01:10:56.687 --> 01:11:01.213
trust. teamwork. respect.
and a 'no asshole rule.'

1304
01:11:01.344 --> 01:11:03.171
Literally the day I got here

1305
01:11:03.302 --> 01:11:05.043
I put into place the
'no asshole theory.'

1306
01:11:05.173 --> 01:11:06.871
One: not going to hire 'em.

1307
01:11:07.001 --> 01:11:11.267
or tolerate anybody who puts
himself ahead of the firm.

1308
01:11:11.397 --> 01:11:15.271
or the clients and we're
going to only do business

1309
01:11:15.401 --> 01:11:17.055
with people who are high
integrity.

1310
01:11:17.185 --> 01:11:19.100
When I'm recruiting people.
I tell everybody this.

1311
01:11:19.231 --> 01:11:22.016
I say "If you're an asshole.
don't come. You'll be fired."

1312
01:11:22.147 --> 01:11:25.455
JOHN WALKER:
So where did you come up.
like the use of the word.

1313
01:11:25.585 --> 01:11:27.761
Can we talk about the
use of the word?

1314
01:11:27.892 --> 01:11:31.112
I don't know. I just did because
I kept calling all these bad

1315
01:11:31.243 --> 01:11:33.289
people at Kidder. Peabody
assholes and I'm not

1316
01:11:33.419 --> 01:11:36.204
gonna work with those people
anymore and one of the reasons

1317
01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:39.382
that I came to Baird. with a
smaller firm. was to get away

1318
01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:41.035
from that to be
perfectly honest.

1319
01:11:41.166 --> 01:11:42.689
LESLIE DIXON:
It was controversial.

1320
01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.954
There was some conservatives
in the firm who were like

1321
01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:49.305
"Oh my gosh you can't
say that out loud".

1322
01:11:49.435 --> 01:11:52.395
and then there was others that
you can tell just loved it.

1323
01:11:52.525 --> 01:11:56.486
It is what it is and. and we
talk about it openly and some

1324
01:11:56.616 --> 01:12:00.664
people will temper it to the "no
jerk rule." but a lot of people

1325
01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:03.580
have gotten use to just
saying "the no asshole rule."

1326
01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:06.060
It begins with the respect
of every individual

1327
01:12:06.191 --> 01:12:10.630
and that is the core value is
every person. what they do.

1328
01:12:10.761 --> 01:12:15.331
what they accomplish. what they
add to the enterprise is core to

1329
01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:19.117
our success and every individual
is important and when you have

1330
01:12:19.247 --> 01:12:22.729
that basic respect. then
you can build trust

1331
01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.776
and our business is all about
trust and if you build trust.

1332
01:12:25.906 --> 01:12:28.561
you'll get. and you do that long
enough then you've built

1333
01:12:28.692 --> 01:12:31.912
a certain pride that
creates an energy

1334
01:12:32.043 --> 01:12:35.742
and dynamic of its own but the
foundation is the respect for

1335
01:12:35.873 --> 01:12:38.832
the every single individual
in the firm.

1336
01:12:38.963 --> 01:12:42.923
When we interview people. we ask
our receptionist who meets them

1337
01:12:43.054 --> 01:12:47.537
all. what they thought of that
person as they were waiting for

1338
01:12:47.667 --> 01:12:52.716
five minutes and we'll hear the
stories of "Wow. they were rude.

1339
01:12:52.846 --> 01:12:57.111
they were condescending." and
we have said no to people.

1340
01:12:57.242 --> 01:12:59.853
Yeah. look I can't tell you
the number of conversations

1341
01:12:59.984 --> 01:13:02.639
where I said "You're right
Joe. you're really special.

1342
01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:04.771
You're so special. you need
to work someplace else."

1343
01:13:05.903 --> 01:13:08.732
And you mean that and when
you do. people cheer you

1344
01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:10.734
because the greater
good prevails

1345
01:13:10.864 --> 01:13:13.171
and it's a winning
strategy for us.

1346
01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.349
JOHN WALKER:
The strategy is working so
well. they are number four

1347
01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.091
on Fortune's 100 Best
Companies to Work For.

1348
01:13:20.221 --> 01:13:23.137
and the top financial
firm on the list.

1349
01:13:23.268 --> 01:13:26.576
The firms that are in the
top 100 great places to work.

1350
01:13:26.706 --> 01:13:29.230
outperform their peers two and
half. to three. to one.

1351
01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:30.841
in terms of returns.

1352
01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:36.455
PAUL PURCELL:
This difficult behavior
by Wall Street oriented.

1353
01:13:36.586 --> 01:13:39.980
larger firms is a
huge plus for us

1354
01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:42.679
because we're very different.

1355
01:13:42.809 --> 01:13:45.769
Here at Baird. two out of three
people are shareholders.

1356
01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:48.511
So. what. what we say to
people is. "It's your firm.

1357
01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:52.863
behave accordingly.
protect your firm."

1358
01:13:52.993 --> 01:13:55.256
It is a very powerful message.

1359
01:13:55.387 --> 01:13:58.825
You're an owner. protect
your franchise

1360
01:14:00.087 --> 01:14:01.524
and you make people
accountable.

1361
01:14:04.483 --> 01:14:06.224
It's that long-term
orientation that is.

1362
01:14:06.354 --> 01:14:07.878
that's missing from most
of Wall Street.

1363
01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.795
[office chatter]

1364
01:14:11.925 --> 01:14:15.015
You know. in 2008 and 2009. one
of the beautiful things that

1365
01:14:15.146 --> 01:14:17.496
we were able to do. was not
lay anybody off.

1366
01:14:18.976 --> 01:14:21.108
And they were throwing
thousands. tens of thousands

1367
01:14:21.239 --> 01:14:26.418
of people out between September
of '08 and March of '09 and

1368
01:14:26.549 --> 01:14:29.682
that we kept our trust with
all of our associates

1369
01:14:29.813 --> 01:14:32.206
and then we came out of the
downturn just roaring.

1370
01:14:32.337 --> 01:14:34.644
But it goes back to
how you were raised

1371
01:14:34.774 --> 01:14:36.472
when it was all
said and done.

1372
01:14:36.602 --> 01:14:38.691
You know. were you raised
in a family

1373
01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:41.172
and with really good
core values?

1374
01:14:41.302 --> 01:14:44.001
People go. "Oh. it can't
be that simple." It is.

1375
01:14:45.959 --> 01:14:49.659
You either have it or you don't
and you can't drift.

1376
01:14:49.789 --> 01:14:52.226
You can't drift.

1377
01:14:52.357 --> 01:14:53.880
In the asset management
business.

1378
01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:55.969
we call it style drift.
We cannot drift.

1379
01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:59.364
We need to stay back and every
time there's a big issue

1380
01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.149
we need to. we go but does
this. is this consistent

1381
01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.891
with our core values and
if it is you do it.

1382
01:15:05.022 --> 01:15:06.502
If it's not. you don't.

1383
01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.247
It's really pretty simple. but
it takes a lot of discipline

1384
01:15:13.378 --> 01:15:17.513
and a lot of focus because.
you know. like

1385
01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:20.559
"Well. just this one time."
right and you're like "No!"

1386
01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:23.344
You can't do that. and
then. 'cause if you do

1387
01:15:23.475 --> 01:15:24.955
then people won't trust you.

1388
01:15:28.262 --> 01:15:31.701
JOHN WALKER:
After grasping the destructive
impact of asshole behavior.

1389
01:15:31.831 --> 01:15:35.531
and the courage it takes
to push back. I asked Aaron

1390
01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:38.229
if he felt anything had changed
since he wrote his book.

1391
01:15:39.796 --> 01:15:42.363
The asshole explosion was
something I never would have

1392
01:15:42.494 --> 01:15:46.324
guessed would ever happen when
I started thinking about.

1393
01:15:46.454 --> 01:15:48.892
I mean. I sort of described
it in abstract terms.

1394
01:15:49.022 --> 01:15:52.504
but if you'd have told me
that our country was headed

1395
01:15:52.635 --> 01:15:54.854
towards something like that.
I would have been shocked.

1396
01:15:54.985 --> 01:15:57.770
I mean at the time I thought
we were on the precipice.

1397
01:15:57.901 --> 01:15:59.380
right and then what
happened was.

1398
01:15:59.511 --> 01:16:02.035
we just you know.
went all in

1399
01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:05.299
and. you know and now it's
really sort of our fate's.

1400
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:07.693
you know. unclear.

1401
01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:09.956
JOHN WALKER:
Are you worried?

1402
01:16:10.087 --> 01:16:11.871
Yeah. yeah. I'm worried.
yeah. I am worried.

1403
01:16:12.002 --> 01:16:21.489
[soft piano music]

1404
01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.971
JOHN WALKER:
I have Aaron to thank for his
warning of the rising tide

1405
01:16:25.102 --> 01:16:28.845
of assholery and for a journey
that leaves me hopeful about

1406
01:16:28.975 --> 01:16:30.760
the resilience of
human decency.

1407
01:16:34.938 --> 01:16:39.899
You know. if you walk and you
see somebody being an asshole

1408
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:43.599
with someone. with a woman.
with a girl. with a dog.

1409
01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:45.818
with a gay. with a transgender.

1410
01:16:45.949 --> 01:16:49.561
with an old people. with
a foreigner. whoever.

1411
01:16:49.692 --> 01:16:53.434
and you decide just. you
pretend you haven't seen.

1412
01:16:53.565 --> 01:16:58.483
then you are the same
asshole like him.

1413
01:16:59.745 --> 01:17:03.836
If you decide to react.

1414
01:17:03.967 --> 01:17:06.273
then you are doing
something really big.

1415
01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:12.410
Like a little stone. you know.
in a pool of indifference.

1416
01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:17.807
Little rings that go wider
and wider and wider

1417
01:17:17.937 --> 01:17:21.506
can reach longer distances.
