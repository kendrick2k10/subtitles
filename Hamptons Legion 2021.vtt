3
00:01:36.864 --> 00:01:39.933
- Taking a break
already. eh. Nathaniel?

4
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.469
- Yes. sir.

5
00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.238
Been out in those fields
since early this morning.

6
00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:45.173
- I see.

7
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.877
How are those crops looking.
now those floods passed us by?

8
00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:55.616
- Some parts good.
Some parts poorly. sir.

9
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.618
- Behaving poorly?

10
00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:00.388
- Yes. sir. because of
those floods you mentioned.

11
00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:04.358
- Those crops have plenty
of time to recover.

12
00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:06.294
- Yes. sir. they might.

13
00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:07.795
- They might?

14
00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:09.730
You better hope they might.

15
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.665
or it comes outta your hide.

16
00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:13.867
- We all working on it. sir.

17
00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.804
- Nathaniel. you remember
them whuppings I used

18
00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:18.939
to give you when you
let your people slide.

19
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.110
I know it's been a long time.

20
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.079
but those whuppings can
come back. you hear me?

21
00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.481
- Yes. sir.

22
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:28.682
- Okay then.

23
00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.958
- Did Nathaniel do
something wrong. Daddy?

24
00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.260
- Not really.

25
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.295
- Why you treat him like that?

26
00:02:41.295 --> 00:02:45.633
- Wade. you gotta learn
how to treat these folks.

27
00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:46.734
Put the fear in them.

28
00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.339
Don't worry. I'll teach you.

29
00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:33.113
- Nathaniel. I told you
this was gonna happen

30
00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:35.283
if you didn't keep things right!

31
00:03:35.283 --> 00:03:36.650
- Yes. sir.

32
00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.208
- What you doing out?

33
00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:04.077
- I heard you yelling. wanted
to make sure you were okay.

34
00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:08.616
- Hurt. but I'll be all right

35
00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:10.518
in a few days. I reckon.

36
00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:14.722
- Why'd my daddy
hit you like that?

37
00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:17.558
- That's just what
he does. Wade.

38
00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:24.632
- Can I get you something?

39
00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:26.600
- No no.

40
00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:30.704
You shouldn't be
here. It's just ...

41
00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.873
- It's just that what?

42
00:04:32.873 --> 00:04:37.511
- One day. way off. you'll
be running this place.

43
00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.882
I want you to
promise me something.

44
00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:43.851
- Okay.

45
00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.522
- Promise me you
gonna treat my people

46
00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:51.258
better than your daddy did.

47
00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:56.664
- I promise.

48
00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:01.735
- Thank you. Now
get on back home.

49
00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:03.070
- Okay.

50
00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:29.530
- Is something
wrong. Master Wade?

51
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.266
I figured you'd be outside
enjoying this fine weather.

52
00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:35.903
- Everything's okay.
I was just thinking.

53
00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:39.640
- Well. it must be
some powerful thinking

54
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.442
if you had to come
in here to do it?

55
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.579
- Sarah. when you
promise something.

56
00:05:45.579 --> 00:05:47.615
do you always have
to keep that promise?

57
00:05:47.615 --> 00:05:49.950
- I suppose you
should try. Wade.

58
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.386
Somebody's promise
is their word.

59
00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:56.156
and keeping their word
is very important.

60
00:05:56.156 --> 00:06:00.794
- I know. It's hon.
hon. honorable.

61
00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:02.295
- That's right.

62
00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:05.399
If you don't mind me asking.
who'd you make the promise to?

63
00:06:07.067 --> 00:06:07.935
- Nathaniel.

64
00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:14.508
Nathaniel?
From the village?

65
00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:18.879
- Yes. ma'am.

66
00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.381
- What was the promise
you made. Master Wade?

67
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.617
- Don't tell my pa.

68
00:06:24.952 --> 00:06:26.253
- Oh. I won't.

69
00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:29.490
- Last night. I saw him
beating on Nathaniel.

70
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.261
giving him a real hard beating.

71
00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:35.696
- Did he know you were there?

72
00:06:37.698 --> 00:06:38.866
- Uh-uh.

73
00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:42.670
I saw Nathaniel later.
and he was hurt.

74
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.639
- What did Nathaniel
have to say to you?

75
00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.141
- He asked me to promise
not to hurt his people.

76
00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:52.580
- Do you think you can keep
that promise. Master Wade?

77
00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:56.183
- I think I probably should.

78
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:32.252
- Sir. supper should
be ready in an hour.

79
00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:33.754
- Thank you. Sarah.

80
00:07:33.754 --> 00:07:37.324
I saw you and my son speaking
in the sitting room earlier.

81
00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:40.494
- Yes. sir. we were talking
about keeping promises.

82
00:07:40.494 --> 00:07:42.129
that kinda thing.

83
00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:45.032
- What promise did he not keep?

84
00:07:45.032 --> 00:07:48.669
- Oh. well. he doesn't know
if it'll be kept or not.

85
00:07:50.738 --> 00:07:53.306
- I believe I know
what this is about.

86
00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:55.843
You do. sir?

87
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.548
- Yeah. he took a
liking to my new rifle.

88
00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:03.050
and I promised I'd get
him one just like it.

89
00:08:04.217 --> 00:08:06.219
- Oh. I see.

90
00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:09.389
- Problem is. he's
a mite small still

91
00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:11.559
for a gun of that caliber.

92
00:08:11.559 --> 00:08:14.862
- Sir. may I suggest
the general store?

93
00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:16.864
- What for?

94
00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.033
- They have a fine
selection of toy guns

95
00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:22.369
that almost look
like the real ones.

96
00:08:24.972 --> 00:08:26.907
- That might buy
me a year or two?

97
00:08:28.308 --> 00:08:30.744
- Would you like me
to pick up a couple?

98
00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:32.145
I know you're busy.

99
00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:33.313
- If you don't mind.

100
00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:35.749
- Yes. sir.

101
00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:39.787
- I always tell him. a
man's word is his currency.

102
00:08:41.722 --> 00:08:43.824
You can't break your word.

103
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.177
- Wade. Preston. y'all
about ready in there?

104
00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:15.055
That'll do.

105
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:22.529
Preston. you aint going to
battle with your bare feet.

106
00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:24.564
- I'm still getting
my boots shined.

107
00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.133
You might
as well come in and see

108
00:09:26.133 --> 00:09:28.401
what kinda mischief
we're getting into.

109
00:09:34.241 --> 00:09:37.277
- Well look at that.
my three handsome men.

110
00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:39.479
Tell me. Wade. what
do we have here?

111
00:09:39.479 --> 00:09:44.484
- I'm the colonel. and
Wade is the aide-de-camp

112
00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:46.854
to General Johnston.

113
00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:49.356
Preston is my aide-de-camp.

114
00:09:49.356 --> 00:09:51.524
- That's wonderful.
What is an aide-de-camp?

115
00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:53.560
- We tell them what
to do. and they go out

116
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.696
and tell everybody
else what to do.

117
00:09:55.696 --> 00:09:57.965
- Do you boys think
you can handle that?

118
00:09:57.965 --> 00:09:59.499
- Yes. ma'am.
- Yes. ma'am.

119
00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:01.534
- So where are y'all
heading off to?

120
00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:05.005
- Well we're not 100% sure.
We think it's Virginia.

121
00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:07.741
- Well dinner's almost ready.
so we better get in there.

122
00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:15.015
- Men. I have asked
you here today

123
00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:17.584
to tell you about my family.

124
00:10:17.584 --> 00:10:20.120
And I wanna tell you a
little bit about myself.

125
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.724
I am Colonel Wade Hampton.

126
00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:26.894
My grandfather was in
the Revolutionary War.

127
00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:29.930
served with a man named
Harry Lighthorse Lee.

128
00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:35.736
You may not know him now.
but you will know his son.

129
00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:39.572
Robert E. Lee. he
is your commander.

130
00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:42.676
My father rode with a man by
the name of Andrew Jackson

131
00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:44.644
in the Battle of New Orleans.

132
00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.147
He actually carried
the victory message

133
00:10:47.147 --> 00:10:49.416
from the battlefield
to the White House.

134
00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:52.385
My heart and soul is
in South Carolina.

135
00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:54.788
You must watch everything
on the battlefield.

136
00:10:54.788 --> 00:10:57.390
because your life depends on it.

137
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.861
There will be hand-to-hand
combat. which you will learn.

138
00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:04.364
There will be snipers
shooting above you.

139
00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:07.267
There will be artillery
fire over your head.

140
00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:09.870
Do not let this scare you.

141
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.807
I want you to go out there
and give them your all.

142
00:11:13.807 --> 00:11:16.276
I want you to be tough as nails.

143
00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:18.678
I want you be strong as steel.

144
00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.480
I want you to go out
there and I want you

145
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.049
to kill some Yankees.

146
00:11:22.049 --> 00:11:24.384
Gentlemen. this
will be an endeavor

147
00:11:24.384 --> 00:11:26.553
that you are soon to begin.

148
00:11:26.553 --> 00:11:28.388
Thank you for being here today.

149
00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:31.658
and thank you for your service.

150
00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:33.693
South Carolina depends on you.

151
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:54.815
- This looks like as
good a place as any.

152
00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:11.364
Hm. thought there
mighta been a crowd.

153
00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:13.500
- Is there a schedule
of some kind?

154
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.603
- It's a battle.
Lizzie. a real battle.

155
00:12:20.941 --> 00:12:22.876
- Someone's walking
around down there.

156
00:12:23.977 --> 00:12:25.178
- I see cannon.

157
00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:30.984
- Well I'll be.

158
00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:33.220
- What color are
those men wearing?

159
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.387
- Looks like blue.

160
00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:36.957
- Is that our side?

161
00:12:38.158 --> 00:12:40.160
- I believe the Army
of the Confederacy

162
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.762
will be wearing gray.
from what I've seen.

163
00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:45.265
- Well I hope it starts soon.

164
00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:48.301
- It'll start soon.
now just relax.

165
00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:32.445
Good morning.

166
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:36.083
- Good morning. is this where
the battle's supposed to be?

167
00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:37.117
- Yes. it is.

168
00:13:47.527 --> 00:13:49.930
- We've been here
for a while now.

169
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.899
Nothing's happened yet.

170
00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:53.867
- We've been here forever.

171
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:57.570
- Oh now. we've only been
here a couple of hours.

172
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:00.140
There's a lot of troop
movement down there.

173
00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:15.155
- What are you folk doing here?

174
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:17.824
We're here
to watch the battle.

175
00:14:17.824 --> 00:14:19.026
- Where are you from?

176
00:14:20.427 --> 00:14:23.030
- We're from Manassas.
right down the road a bit.

177
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.166
It was a very pleasant
ride here this morning.

178
00:14:26.166 --> 00:14:28.401
- We're from just outside
of Washington City.

179
00:14:29.436 --> 00:14:31.371
- Y'all are from Washington?

180
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:34.041
- Ladies and gentlemen.
I do not believe

181
00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:37.610
you comprehend the gravity
of these circumstances.

182
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.648
Right down the hill. I have
established a field hospital

183
00:14:41.648 --> 00:14:45.352
where I will be tending
wounded very shortly.

184
00:14:45.352 --> 00:14:48.155
- That's why we're here.
When does it start?

185
00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:50.823
- This is not a game or a play.

186
00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:53.893
Two armies will be
attacking each other.

187
00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:56.263
You are endangering
your own lives.

188
00:14:58.698 --> 00:14:59.532
- Finally.

189
00:15:01.534 --> 00:15:03.336
- All of you folk. all of you.

190
00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:04.904
need to leave here immediately.

191
00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:10.877
- Doesn't she understand?

192
00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:13.713
That's what we came here for.

193
00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:14.914
- Don't worry.

194
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:17.884
If it gets too rough.
we'll bugger out.

195
00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:04.931
- Is this the way
it's supposed to look?

196
00:16:06.099 --> 00:16:08.401
- I can't tell who's
commanding the field.

197
00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:10.437
- Apparently. no one can.

198
00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:14.974
This is a perfect example
of how not to follow orders.

199
00:16:24.217 --> 00:16:25.752
- Ma'am.

200
00:16:25.752 --> 00:16:27.820
- Good afternoon. Colonel.
I shall fetch the doctor.

201
00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:39.199
- Colonel Hampton.
Just get here. sir?

202
00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:41.768
- Just a bit ago. they
been keeping your busy?

203
00:16:41.768 --> 00:16:43.936
- We're maintaining control.

204
00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:45.905
- The wounded
arrive sporadically.

205
00:16:45.905 --> 00:16:47.907
How's the battle going?

206
00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:49.842
- It's fixing to get worse.

207
00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:52.612
- My guess. it's about to
get a lot more ferocious.

208
00:16:52.612 --> 00:16:54.814
What
makes you say that?

209
00:16:54.814 --> 00:16:56.983
Hampton Legion's here.

210
00:16:56.983 --> 00:16:59.219
- I hope you can
end this quickly.

211
00:16:59.219 --> 00:17:01.354
- Well we'll end this all right.

212
00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:02.755
- They sure sound confident.

213
00:17:04.291 --> 00:17:06.626
- We'll have to make
more accommodations.

214
00:17:06.626 --> 00:17:09.862
Christine. the colonel
anticipates more wounded.

215
00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:11.164
- Right now?

216
00:17:11.164 --> 00:17:12.499
Soon.

217
00:17:12.499 --> 00:17:14.901
- I will get to the
well for more water.

218
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:16.403
- What makes you think
you can do anything

219
00:17:16.403 --> 00:17:18.605
with that mess out there?

220
00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:20.039
- We just got a gun.

221
00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:23.176
Our brand-new
Enfield rifles from England.

222
00:17:23.176 --> 00:17:25.312
- They won't know what hit them.

223
00:17:25.312 --> 00:17:27.547
- Y'all just remember.
Hampton Legion's here now.

224
00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:28.448
We'll protect you.

225
00:17:29.616 --> 00:17:30.450
Ma'am.

226
00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:51.738
- Those horses are magnificent.

227
00:17:51.738 --> 00:17:54.040
- I think Daniel's
in the cavalry.

228
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.708
- That's right.

229
00:17:55.708 --> 00:17:57.344
- Do you know
someone down there?

230
00:17:58.645 --> 00:17:59.912
- Yes. my husband.

231
00:18:01.047 --> 00:18:02.582
- Your husband's
fighting out there?

232
00:18:03.483 --> 00:18:04.717
- Yes.

233
00:18:04.717 --> 00:18:06.119
- No wonder you
came to see this.

234
00:18:12.725 --> 00:18:13.960
What color is he wearing?

235
00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:17.297
- He's wearing blue.

236
00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:23.670
- Well. we're here supporting
the Army of the Confederacy.

237
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.938
under the command
of General Johnston.

238
00:18:27.207 --> 00:18:28.841
- Okay.

239
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.148
- Do you hear that?

240
00:18:35.148 --> 00:18:37.817
- Those big guns
sure are powerful.

241
00:18:58.205 --> 00:19:00.673
- Well. that officer is
certainly doing his part.

242
00:19:00.673 --> 00:19:02.242
- Why aren't the men responding?

243
00:19:03.543 --> 00:19:06.045
- Many of them are
going home next week.

244
00:19:06.045 --> 00:19:09.349
I knew these short-term
enlistments were a bad idea.

245
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.308
- What a mess.

246
00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:40.380
- They're all green.
both ours and theirs.

247
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.481
- What the hell just happened?

248
00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:43.883
Why are we losing so many men?

249
00:19:43.883 --> 00:19:46.486
- The enemy's carrying
a new regimental flag.

250
00:19:46.486 --> 00:19:48.388
- I believe that's
South Carolina.

251
00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:15.114
- Doctor. you need to
take a look at this.

252
00:20:17.284 --> 00:20:19.452
- Christine. come quickly.

253
00:20:19.452 --> 00:20:22.522
Doctor. please wash your hands
before you touch his face.

254
00:20:25.425 --> 00:20:28.328
Colonel. you need
to put this in your report.

255
00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:30.263
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

256
00:20:50.317 --> 00:20:53.353
Looks like I didn't give
y'all too much to work with.

257
00:20:53.353 --> 00:20:55.788
- We have set up stations
all through the house

258
00:20:55.788 --> 00:20:57.324
for the wounded soldiers.

259
00:20:57.324 --> 00:21:00.293
We are trying to keep them
as comfortable as possible.

260
00:21:00.293 --> 00:21:02.261
- Christine. you can head
back to the house now.

261
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:04.063
But when you're finished
in there. please come back

262
00:21:04.063 --> 00:21:06.299
and help me with the
soldiers in the tent.

263
00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:08.568
- Yes. I should be
finished in an hour or so.

264
00:21:11.738 --> 00:21:13.640
- How'd this happen?

265
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.843
- We were in the heat of
battle. I didn't feel a thing.

266
00:21:16.843 --> 00:21:20.212
- You'll have to forgive Mary.
She's a little headstrong.

267
00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:22.349
But she's got a
lot of experience.

268
00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:23.750
- Nothing to forgive.

269
00:21:28.621 --> 00:21:30.490
- Our hospitals are
getting overwhelmed. sir.

270
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:31.658
Should we pull back?

271
00:21:32.559 --> 00:21:34.494
- We are here for a reason.

272
00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:35.862
The men have to get
used to the idea

273
00:21:35.862 --> 00:21:39.098
that this is what
war looks like!

274
00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:26.479
- What are you folk
still doing here?

275
00:22:26.479 --> 00:22:28.515
- The children don't
wanna leave yet.

276
00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:29.749
- My husband's in this.

277
00:22:29.749 --> 00:22:31.784
I'm not leaving till
I know he's okay.

278
00:22:35.422 --> 00:22:37.557
- Do you know what this is?

279
00:22:37.557 --> 00:22:39.426
- Is that real blood?

280
00:22:39.426 --> 00:22:41.461
- Of course it is.
What else would it be?

281
00:22:42.829 --> 00:22:45.264
- I have spent the
entire afternoon

282
00:22:45.264 --> 00:22:47.434
tending to injured soldiers.

283
00:22:48.668 --> 00:22:51.638
Many had surgery. and
some did not survive.

284
00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:55.808
Now my hospital is about
100 yards down there.

285
00:22:55.808 --> 00:22:59.311
and it's only about 100 yards
away from the battlefield.

286
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.884
I will have many more
wounded soldiers to patch up.

287
00:23:04.884 --> 00:23:09.021
and I do not want to have to
spend time tending to civilians

288
00:23:09.021 --> 00:23:11.858
who were too foolish to
get out of harm's way.

289
00:23:13.292 --> 00:23:14.827
- I think we need to go. John.

290
00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:19.265
- All right. well. we'll
pack things up then.

291
00:23:19.265 --> 00:23:21.000
- You have been warned.

292
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.669
And that goes for you too.

293
00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:33.012
- Lizzie. Levi. help pick up.

294
00:23:35.782 --> 00:23:38.184
- Well. hold on
just a minute now.

295
00:23:38.184 --> 00:23:40.219
Another few minutes
won't hurt anything.

296
00:23:56.002 --> 00:23:58.337
- Casualties are heavy. Colonel.

297
00:23:58.337 --> 00:24:00.973
- I'm sure it's the same
on the other side. Major.

298
00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:03.510
Our men signed up for this
of their own free will.

299
00:24:05.612 --> 00:24:06.846
- I don't believe they knew what

300
00:24:06.846 --> 00:24:08.180
they were getting
themselves into.

301
00:24:30.336 --> 00:24:33.940
- What the hell
y'all doing here?

302
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:41.047
Don't kill us.

303
00:24:41.047 --> 00:24:42.481
- Get the hell out of here!

304
00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:44.551
It aint time for a picnic!

305
00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:48.320
Come on.

306
00:24:49.589 --> 00:24:50.422
Come on!

307
00:24:56.162 --> 00:24:57.096
- Did you see that?

308
00:24:57.096 --> 00:24:59.098
Our men pushed their cavalry

309
00:24:59.098 --> 00:25:01.200
all the way back into the woods!

310
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.836
- Looks like they scared off
that group of spectators.

311
00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:05.271
- Spectators?

312
00:25:06.472 --> 00:25:09.308
What are spectators doing here?

313
00:25:09.308 --> 00:25:10.442
They have no business!

314
00:25:12.679 --> 00:25:13.946
- Sir.

315
00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:15.948
- Kirkland. I heard you
was here. What happened?

316
00:25:15.948 --> 00:25:17.684
- Yanks shot my horse
out from under me.

317
00:25:17.684 --> 00:25:22.555
Bullet grazed my head. but my
horse took three hard hits.

318
00:25:22.555 --> 00:25:24.557
Poor thing slid sideways
for several yards.

319
00:25:24.557 --> 00:25:26.893
My leg got trapped under him.

320
00:25:26.893 --> 00:25:28.360
- What's the damage. Nurse?

321
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:30.162
- That wound on his
head is still bleeding.

322
00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:32.632
but it did not
puncture his skull.

323
00:25:32.632 --> 00:25:34.100
He was quite fortunate.

324
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.436
Another half-inch and it
would have blown his head off.

325
00:25:37.436 --> 00:25:39.171
That leg is the serious injury.

326
00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:41.808
- Busted up pretty
bad. she said.

327
00:25:41.808 --> 00:25:43.242
- Broken in four places.

328
00:25:43.242 --> 00:25:44.911
We set it as best we could.

329
00:25:46.579 --> 00:25:47.680
- Does it hurt much. Sergeant?

330
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.916
- It was absolutely horrid.

331
00:25:49.916 --> 00:25:52.484
till these nice ladies
took care of me.

332
00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:55.221
- Our morphine supply
is adequate at present.

333
00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:56.989
But I don't know how
long it will last

334
00:25:56.989 --> 00:25:59.058
if these battles continue.

335
00:25:59.058 --> 00:26:00.627
- Sarge. don't you
worry about it.

336
00:26:00.627 --> 00:26:03.462
We'll make sure you get
home to your family.

337
00:26:03.462 --> 00:26:05.031
- Absolutely not. sir.

338
00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:06.866
Soon as I can walk again.
I'll be back in the fight.

339
00:26:06.866 --> 00:26:10.336
- That could be a very
long time. Sergeant.

340
00:26:10.336 --> 00:26:13.339
- Kirkland. it's probably
best that you recover at home.

341
00:26:13.339 --> 00:26:16.475
instead of being dragged
around who knows where.

342
00:26:16.475 --> 00:26:19.545
Once you feel you can ride.
we'll get you a fresh horse.

343
00:26:19.545 --> 00:26:22.815
- As long as you're
in the fight. sir.
I'll be in the fight.

344
00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:25.284
- Sergeant. I'll check
on you as soon as I can.

345
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.525
Nurse. how long do
you think it'll be

346
00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:35.061
before he can ride again?

347
00:26:35.061 --> 00:26:37.697
- I don't know if he'll ever
even be able to walk again.

348
00:26:37.697 --> 00:26:41.768
And if he does. it will be
with a cane at the very least.

349
00:26:43.803 --> 00:26:48.808
- I understand.

350
00:27:07.126 --> 00:27:09.862
- Did you find out why that
company of our infantry

351
00:27:09.862 --> 00:27:12.264
just walked off the field?

352
00:27:12.264 --> 00:27:15.034
- Heard tell they were
headed back to Washington.

353
00:27:15.034 --> 00:27:17.269
General direction anyway.

354
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:18.871
- Washington?

355
00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:20.773
That's over 20 miles from here.

356
00:27:20.773 --> 00:27:22.709
It would have been
so lovely of them

357
00:27:22.709 --> 00:27:25.011
to inform us of
their destination.

358
00:27:26.178 --> 00:27:28.514
- I don't think they
care anymore. sir.

359
00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:30.449
- This is desertion.

360
00:27:30.449 --> 00:27:33.853
I want their officer
and every man. ow!

361
00:27:33.853 --> 00:27:34.754
Ow!

362
00:27:34.754 --> 00:27:36.155
- Colonel!

363
00:27:36.155 --> 00:27:40.492
- Ow. oh. please
don't touch that arm.

364
00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:42.628
I've been shot in the elbow.

365
00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:45.998
- Are you sure it's the elbow?

366
00:27:45.998 --> 00:27:49.035
- Yes. I'm sure it's the elbow.

367
00:27:49.035 --> 00:27:50.636
- Let's get you to the hospital.

368
00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:26.873
- Good afternoon. Sergeant
Major. how may I help you?

369
00:28:42.889 --> 00:28:44.223
- Caught a piece of something.

370
00:28:44.223 --> 00:28:46.592
Shrapnel. I don't
know. or something.

371
00:28:46.592 --> 00:28:48.527
- Have a seat. Let's
take a look at it.

372
00:29:04.443 --> 00:29:06.946
I can fix that up for
you. Does it hurt much?

373
00:29:06.946 --> 00:29:07.980
- What do you think?

374
00:29:16.388 --> 00:29:17.489
- Mary!

375
00:29:17.489 --> 00:29:18.690
- I'm coming. Christine.

376
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.671
This looks serious.

377
00:29:38.577 --> 00:29:40.112
- So is mine.

378
00:29:40.112 --> 00:29:43.649
Sergeant Major.
this man has a bullet in him.

379
00:29:43.649 --> 00:29:47.820
Yours is not life-threatening.
Please be patient.

380
00:29:49.688 --> 00:29:51.757
- I aint trying to
cause no trouble here!

381
00:29:54.193 --> 00:29:55.494
- I hope not.

382
00:29:56.929 --> 00:29:59.866
- What I mean is. we
supposed to be first

383
00:29:59.866 --> 00:30:01.367
when it comes to medical.

384
00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:03.502
- Did you not just
hear me tell you

385
00:30:03.502 --> 00:30:06.305
that this man has a
life-threatening injury?

386
00:30:11.277 --> 00:30:13.812
- I'm just telling you the
way it's supposed to be.

387
00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:21.120
- Sergeant Major. Mary
is very busy right now.

388
00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.923
and she is the only
one here at present

389
00:30:23.923 --> 00:30:26.125
qualified to do
what she is doing.

390
00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:31.030
So I would suggest. you
allow us to proceed.

391
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.699
and at the proper
time. we will find you.

392
00:30:34.633 --> 00:30:35.567
Thank you.

393
00:30:47.013 --> 00:30:48.014
- Thank you.

394
00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:52.885
- I didn't see you
eat much today.

395
00:30:52.885 --> 00:30:54.786
You must keep up your strength.

396
00:30:58.624 --> 00:31:01.193
- It has been a chaotic day.

397
00:31:01.193 --> 00:31:04.296
far busier than any of us
could have anticipated.

398
00:31:04.296 --> 00:31:07.699
- A long battle. and
so many casualties.

399
00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:10.002
Do you think they
were expecting this?

400
00:31:10.002 --> 00:31:11.270
- No I don't.

401
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:13.272
It was certainly more
than the picnic crowd

402
00:31:13.272 --> 00:31:14.440
could have anticipated.

403
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:17.076
- What were they thinking?

404
00:31:17.076 --> 00:31:19.211
- They were thinking it
was going to be quick

405
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:22.248
and easy. and it
will be neither.

406
00:31:22.248 --> 00:31:25.717
These politicians have no
idea what they've started.

407
00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:29.688
- So. who did you see today
that tickled your fancy?

408
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:32.558
- You mean men.

409
00:31:32.558 --> 00:31:34.293
- Of course I mean men.

410
00:31:34.293 --> 00:31:37.463
So many fine
specimen here today.

411
00:31:37.463 --> 00:31:40.766
- Spoken like the school
teacher you are. Christine.

412
00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:45.237
But I'm not looking for
another husband right now.

413
00:31:45.237 --> 00:31:48.040
- Well I must admit that I am.

414
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.676
Surely one of these
strapping officers

415
00:31:50.676 --> 00:31:52.411
would love a fine German wife.

416
00:31:53.845 --> 00:31:55.581
So who did you find interesting?

417
00:31:57.883 --> 00:32:01.653
- I will tell you who I respect.
It's that Colonel Hampton.

418
00:32:02.488 --> 00:32:03.956
Why so?

419
00:32:03.956 --> 00:32:06.092
- For one thing.
he's very wealthy.

420
00:32:06.092 --> 00:32:08.294
- Oh. I like him already.

421
00:32:08.294 --> 00:32:10.162
- He's quite married. my dear.

422
00:32:11.463 --> 00:32:13.966
But the reason I
respect him so much is

423
00:32:13.966 --> 00:32:17.669
that he financed his
entire operation himself.

424
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:20.372
that army he calls
Hampton's Legion.

425
00:32:20.372 --> 00:32:21.640
Did he now?

426
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.709
- Yes. and I have done
something similar.

427
00:32:23.709 --> 00:32:26.645
though not quite
such a grand scale.

428
00:32:27.813 --> 00:32:29.248
- What do you mean?

429
00:32:29.248 --> 00:32:32.651
- My field hospital. I
paid for everything myself.

430
00:32:33.619 --> 00:32:35.087
- I had no idea.

431
00:32:36.522 --> 00:32:40.993
So. what do you hope to
reap from your investment?

432
00:32:40.993 --> 00:32:42.694
A political appointment perhaps?

433
00:32:43.862 --> 00:32:46.898
- If women could
only hold office.

434
00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:49.068
You know. I would be
happy to get the vote.

435
00:32:50.302 --> 00:32:53.072
But as a nurse.
you know my concern

436
00:32:53.072 --> 00:32:55.474
has been with saving lives.

437
00:32:55.474 --> 00:32:57.476
And this is one
arena where I can put

438
00:32:57.476 --> 00:32:59.111
my concerns into action.

439
00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:02.481
So you
will continue to do this?

440
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:04.383
- Yes. as long as it's needed.

441
00:33:04.383 --> 00:33:07.453
And I think it will be
needed for a very long time.

442
00:33:07.453 --> 00:33:10.722
- And I will help. if
that meets your approval.

443
00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:14.593
- Of course it does. You
were invaluable here today.

444
00:33:14.593 --> 00:33:16.595
We need to show these
men that nursing

445
00:33:16.595 --> 00:33:19.065
is a profession for
respectable women.

446
00:38:29.508 --> 00:38:31.443
- What's the matter with
this soldier here. ma'am?

447
00:38:31.443 --> 00:38:32.878
I noticed the blue coat.

448
00:38:35.414 --> 00:38:38.049
- Yes. General. he
was bleeding profusely

449
00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:40.352
and probably would
not have survived

450
00:38:40.352 --> 00:38:43.589
if he had tried to reach
the Federal hospital.

451
00:38:46.124 --> 00:38:47.826
- What's your name. Soldier?

452
00:38:47.826 --> 00:38:51.296
- Francis Peffer. Private.
19th Indiana Infantry.

453
00:38:51.296 --> 00:38:52.498
United States Army.

454
00:38:53.665 --> 00:38:55.967
- All righty. if you
wanna play that game.

455
00:38:55.967 --> 00:38:59.671
Wade Hampton. General.
Confederate States of America.

456
00:39:02.007 --> 00:39:04.743
Something you don't understand
about that. Trooper?

457
00:39:04.743 --> 00:39:06.978
- The way I see it.
you're all outlaws.

458
00:39:06.978 --> 00:39:08.447
Outlaw leadership.

459
00:39:09.848 --> 00:39:10.982
Outlaw government.

460
00:39:14.252 --> 00:39:16.622
- You might wanna consider
that these outlaws

461
00:39:16.622 --> 00:39:18.390
just saved your life.

462
00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:29.134
- Ladies. I am indebted
to you. for your service.

463
00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:36.374
General?

464
00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:37.476
- Yes. Private.

465
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:41.146
- Sir. if you don't
mind me asking.

466
00:39:41.146 --> 00:39:43.048
what's going to happen to me?

467
00:39:43.048 --> 00:39:46.785
- Well. we got a good many
prisoners on both sides now.

468
00:39:46.785 --> 00:39:50.021
I would say that we're due
for a prisoner exchange.

469
00:39:51.156 --> 00:39:53.091
But don't hold me to that.

470
00:39:53.091 --> 00:39:54.192
- Thank you. sir.

471
00:39:54.192 --> 00:39:56.928
And I am a volunteer.

472
00:39:58.163 --> 00:39:59.230
- I am too.

473
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.548
- I believe there's
something you wanted to talk

474
00:40:16.548 --> 00:40:19.050
with me about
concerning Sharpsburg.

475
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:21.319
- Yes. General. my scouts
have turned up a way

476
00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:24.590
through the woods that would
save us a lotta trouble.

477
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:27.993
- What exactly would we be
moving through the woods?

478
00:40:27.993 --> 00:40:28.827
- Cavalry.

479
00:40:30.395 --> 00:40:31.229
- Cavalry.

480
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:35.934
I'm not so sure
that's realistic.

481
00:40:35.934 --> 00:40:37.503
- Dismounted cavalry.

482
00:40:37.503 --> 00:40:41.439
No heavy guns. so we don't
bring the horses in first.

483
00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:44.676
That'll put us right on
the rear of the Yankee camp

484
00:40:44.676 --> 00:40:47.212
and still give us the
element of surprise.

485
00:40:47.212 --> 00:40:49.481
- As you know. I tend to favor

486
00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:52.117
a frontal assault
in these situations.

487
00:40:52.117 --> 00:40:55.053
- Which I would understand
if troop strength was equal.

488
00:40:55.053 --> 00:40:58.456
However. McLellan may have
up to twice our number

489
00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:00.626
if you count his reserves.

490
00:41:00.626 --> 00:41:02.794
- He may not bring
in his reserves.

491
00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:08.967
So. I think this
through-the-woods
idea is untried.

492
00:41:11.236 --> 00:41:14.239
And with as much
as we have to risk.

493
00:41:14.239 --> 00:41:15.707
I just can't support it.

494
00:48:04.382 --> 00:48:07.552
- Corporal Jones. you're
going to have to stay still

495
00:48:07.552 --> 00:48:11.356
while I change this. or you
are going to keep bleeding.

496
00:48:11.356 --> 00:48:13.491
- It hurts! It hurts so much!

497
00:48:14.659 --> 00:48:16.261
- Nurse. what's
the problem here?

498
00:48:16.261 --> 00:48:18.997
- General. a bullet went
through this man's chest.

499
00:48:18.997 --> 00:48:20.898
We don't believe it
struck his heart.

500
00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:24.202
but he must calm
himself or he will die.

501
00:48:24.202 --> 00:48:25.036
- Corporal?

502
00:48:26.304 --> 00:48:27.805
- General. sir.

503
00:48:27.805 --> 00:48:30.541
- You got to do what the
nurses tell you. Soldier.

504
00:48:30.541 --> 00:48:31.376
- General. sir.

505
00:48:32.277 --> 00:48:34.745
The pain. horrible.

506
00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:37.315
- General. we have
run out of morphine.

507
00:48:40.185 --> 00:48:42.087
We have a little
laudanum left. Christine.

508
00:48:42.087 --> 00:48:43.221
This will have to do.

509
00:48:49.694 --> 00:48:51.529
- Please listen. Corporal.

510
00:48:51.529 --> 00:48:55.233
This will help the pain.
but you must stay still.

511
00:48:55.233 --> 00:48:59.104
- General. these weapons
are tearing our men apart.

512
00:48:59.104 --> 00:49:02.140
- 57 caliber. large bullets.

513
00:49:03.441 --> 00:49:06.411
- These bullets rip
right through them.

514
00:49:06.411 --> 00:49:08.746
The exit wounds are ungodly.

515
00:49:08.746 --> 00:49:11.549
- Well. coulda been worse.
Coulda been canister shot.

516
00:49:12.984 --> 00:49:14.285
I've heard of it.

517
00:49:14.285 --> 00:49:16.087
What exactly is it?

518
00:49:16.087 --> 00:49:18.689
- They take the round
balls. put them in a can.

519
00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:20.825
seal it up. put a
cannonball on top. fire it.

520
00:49:20.825 --> 00:49:24.529
it explodes and rains
down on the troops.

521
00:49:24.529 --> 00:49:26.164
- That is savage.

522
00:49:27.365 --> 00:49:28.299
Yes it is.

523
00:49:29.434 --> 00:49:31.769
- Would you use
something like that?

524
00:49:31.769 --> 00:49:34.939
- Ma'am. I'd use anything
I could to win this war.

525
00:49:41.246 --> 00:49:42.513
- I was right about one thing.

526
00:49:42.513 --> 00:49:44.482
He didn't bring up a
lot of his reserves.

527
00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:46.817
- No. sir.

528
00:49:48.119 --> 00:49:51.322
- Casualties were
extremely high.

529
00:49:51.322 --> 00:49:52.990
on both sides. I might add.

530
00:49:54.125 --> 00:49:57.195
We just simply can't
afford to engage

531
00:49:57.195 --> 00:49:59.497
in a situation like this again.

532
00:49:59.497 --> 00:50:03.901
- So we are disengaging our
adventure into Maryland?

533
00:50:05.136 --> 00:50:06.003
- Yeah. we are.

534
00:50:09.174 --> 00:50:10.775
- Nurse Wilkins?

535
00:50:10.775 --> 00:50:11.976
- Good afternoon. General.

536
00:50:11.976 --> 00:50:13.278
Were you looking for someone?

537
00:50:13.278 --> 00:50:14.379
- I was. you.

538
00:50:18.416 --> 00:50:20.918
- Very well. how
may I be of help?

539
00:50:20.918 --> 00:50:23.354
- I may have some
unfortunate news for you.

540
00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:25.223
We need
no more of that.

541
00:50:25.223 --> 00:50:26.624
What have you heard?

542
00:50:26.624 --> 00:50:29.560
- The president. Jefferson
Davis. has decreed

543
00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.797
that all hospitals
become military hospitals

544
00:50:32.797 --> 00:50:34.765
and ran by a officer.

545
00:50:36.167 --> 00:50:37.001
- An officer?

546
00:50:39.304 --> 00:50:41.306
What is the purpose of that?

547
00:50:41.306 --> 00:50:44.975
- I would suggest
to hurry up supplies

548
00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:46.377
and to maintain order.

549
00:50:51.849 --> 00:50:54.585
This does not
diminish our gratitude

550
00:50:54.585 --> 00:50:58.823
for everything you have
done. Nurse Wilkins.

551
00:50:58.823 --> 00:50:59.790
- I have an idea.

552
00:51:03.094 --> 00:51:04.562
- And what might that be?

553
00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:08.999
- May I suggest that
you commission me?

554
00:51:08.999 --> 00:51:10.801
Then I can continue
to administer

555
00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:12.570
the hospital as an officer.

556
00:51:14.038 --> 00:51:16.741
- Well. uh.

557
00:51:18.343 --> 00:51:20.010
I don't know about that.

558
00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.280
- This arrangement would
be of great benefit

559
00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.949
to the Army of the Confederacy.

560
00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:26.817
You do understand that?

561
00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:29.320
- Yes I do. but like me.

562
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.789
you pay for your whole
arrangement. but--

563
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:34.692
- I am also a
professional nurse.

564
00:51:34.692 --> 00:51:36.227
When I was in London. I attended

565
00:51:36.227 --> 00:51:39.530
Miss Florence Nightingale's
Academy of Nursing.

566
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:41.332
That is where I
learned the importance

567
00:51:41.332 --> 00:51:43.201
of hygiene and sanitation.

568
00:51:44.435 --> 00:51:46.704
That is why I insist
that my doctors wash

569
00:51:46.704 --> 00:51:48.973
their hands between
every patient.

570
00:51:48.973 --> 00:51:51.676
and why my hospital
has the highest

571
00:51:51.676 --> 00:51:53.411
successful recovery rate.

572
00:51:54.545 --> 00:51:57.582
I am immensely qualified
for this position.

573
00:51:58.583 --> 00:52:01.586
- Of that. I have no doubt.

574
00:52:01.586 --> 00:52:03.288
But the Army of
Northern Virginia

575
00:52:03.288 --> 00:52:06.524
does not commission
female officers.

576
00:52:06.524 --> 00:52:10.161
- Females in this war
have excelled at tasks

577
00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:13.464
that they were once
considered unfit for.

578
00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:15.900
Men need to acknowledge this.

579
00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:18.203
You yourself are acutely aware

580
00:52:18.203 --> 00:52:20.371
of how much I am
needed out here.

581
00:52:25.843 --> 00:52:27.912
- Let me think on
this for just a bit.

582
00:52:32.116 --> 00:52:34.084
- So what you're telling
me. General Hampton.

583
00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:36.487
is that we're running
outta everything?

584
00:52:36.487 --> 00:52:38.556
- I'm not as concerned
about my legion.

585
00:52:38.556 --> 00:52:41.659
As you know. I pay
for everything.

586
00:52:41.659 --> 00:52:45.663
- I continue to commend
you highly for that.

587
00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:47.265
- Thank you.

588
00:52:47.265 --> 00:52:49.434
But I can't do
that beyond my men.

589
00:52:49.434 --> 00:52:53.838
My concern is with the units
that I'm fighting alongside.

590
00:52:53.838 --> 00:52:56.674
- I understand that.
So what do you suggest?

591
00:52:56.674 --> 00:53:00.478
- Well. we need to stop
losing so many soldiers.

592
00:53:00.478 --> 00:53:02.480
- And how would we do that?

593
00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.550
- One way is to
substantially increase

594
00:53:05.550 --> 00:53:08.719
the recovery rate
at field hospitals.

595
00:53:08.719 --> 00:53:11.088
- Same question.
how do we do that?

596
00:53:11.088 --> 00:53:14.124
- By working with
somebody who's done it.

597
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.595
- All right. who's he?

598
00:53:17.595 --> 00:53:19.096
She.

599
00:53:19.096 --> 00:53:20.598
- A nurse?

600
00:53:20.598 --> 00:53:23.100
- Her name is Mary Wilkins.

601
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.637
I first saw her
operation at Manassas.

602
00:53:26.637 --> 00:53:29.674
She runs her own field
hospital. and right now.

603
00:53:29.674 --> 00:53:33.911
her survival rate is 97%.

604
00:53:33.911 --> 00:53:35.280
- That's wonderful.

605
00:53:36.481 --> 00:53:38.849
So what's the problem?
Does she wanna leave?

606
00:53:38.849 --> 00:53:43.321
- General. you may remember
that Jefferson Davis decreed

607
00:53:43.321 --> 00:53:48.158
that all field hospitals must
have an officer in charge.

608
00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:53.264
- Okay. I remember
something about that. yeah.

609
00:53:53.264 --> 00:53:56.901
- I don't wanna lose Miss
Wilkins or her operation.

610
00:53:56.901 --> 00:53:59.003
I believe we need her out there.

611
00:53:59.003 --> 00:54:02.006
and my officers
feel the same way.

612
00:54:02.006 --> 00:54:03.974
- So what are you proposing?

613
00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:07.011
- I'd like to forward a
letter to Jefferson Davis

614
00:54:07.011 --> 00:54:11.416
requesting permission to
commission her in the army.

615
00:54:12.783 --> 00:54:15.019
- General Hampton. I
would love to discuss this

616
00:54:15.019 --> 00:54:18.789
with you at length. but
we've got so many matters

617
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:21.025
on the table. I
just don't have time

618
00:54:21.025 --> 00:54:22.793
to talk about it right now.

619
00:54:22.793 --> 00:54:25.262
- So I have your
support on this?

620
00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:27.197
- For right now. yes.

621
00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:28.065
So what else?

622
00:54:37.475 --> 00:54:40.044
- I believe you
wanted to see me.

623
00:54:40.044 --> 00:54:41.211
Have a seat. gentlemen.

624
00:54:43.314 --> 00:54:45.015
What's on your mind?

625
00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:47.418
- Well. sir. the sergeant
and the corporal here

626
00:54:47.418 --> 00:54:49.720
got a idea they
wanna share with you.

627
00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.255
- All right. let's have it.

628
00:54:53.658 --> 00:54:55.360
- Yes. sir. the corporal
and I have been involved

629
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.261
in several special missions.

630
00:54:57.261 --> 00:55:00.264
- Well. sir. most
of these missions

631
00:55:00.264 --> 00:55:02.266
have been dreamed up
by the captain here.

632
00:55:04.869 --> 00:55:06.337
- Special missions. huh?

633
00:55:06.337 --> 00:55:09.840
Do I know about these
special missions. Captain?

634
00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.276
- Well. some you do
and some you don't.

635
00:55:13.378 --> 00:55:14.645
- I see.

636
00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:17.281
Certainly. do tell.

637
00:55:17.281 --> 00:55:19.183
- We've conducted several
missions behind enemy

638
00:55:19.183 --> 00:55:21.118
lines on the supply chain.

639
00:55:21.118 --> 00:55:23.388
- These raids have
been very effective.

640
00:55:23.388 --> 00:55:26.657
- Well. sometimes it's just
me and Sergeant Causey.

641
00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:28.993
and sometimes ...

642
00:55:28.993 --> 00:55:30.160
- Sometimes what?

643
00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:33.297
- Sometimes. I go with him.

644
00:55:34.365 --> 00:55:35.500
- Why?

645
00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:38.636
- On account of he's
pretty good at it.

646
00:55:38.636 --> 00:55:40.705
- We make a pretty good team.

647
00:55:40.705 --> 00:55:42.306
- A team?

648
00:55:42.306 --> 00:55:45.175
Just you three in this team?

649
00:55:45.175 --> 00:55:47.144
- Sometimes we
bring sharpshooters.

650
00:55:47.144 --> 00:55:50.047
- Sometimes. explosive experts.

651
00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:56.153
- How long has
this been going on?

652
00:55:56.153 --> 00:55:56.987
- About a year.

653
00:55:58.355 --> 00:56:02.092
- Really? And when was you
gonna get around to telling me?

654
00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:03.561
- This evening.

655
00:56:03.561 --> 00:56:07.097
- Okay. fellas. what
do y'all want from me?

656
00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:08.699
- We're giving the group a name.

657
00:56:10.134 --> 00:56:12.537
Just wanna let you know
in case you hear about it.

658
00:56:12.537 --> 00:56:15.172
- Oh well. thanks for
keeping me informed.

659
00:56:15.172 --> 00:56:16.373
What'd you come up with?

660
00:56:17.274 --> 00:56:18.876
- Band of Confederates.

661
00:56:24.482 --> 00:56:27.117
- If the captain here
is involved with any

662
00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:30.888
of these shenanigans. I
wanna know all the way.

663
00:56:34.692 --> 00:56:37.528
Good. now I have an
announcement for you.

664
00:56:38.663 --> 00:56:42.299
We been blessed to work
with the best nurse

665
00:56:42.299 --> 00:56:44.234
in this here Confederate Army.

666
00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:45.836
and that would be Mary Wilkins.

667
00:56:47.672 --> 00:56:49.173
- She's good.

668
00:56:49.173 --> 00:56:53.544
- Recently. our president.
Jefferson Davis. has decreed

669
00:56:53.544 --> 00:56:58.549
that those that run our
hospitals now be officers.

670
00:56:58.549 --> 00:57:02.587
Of course. that would put Miss
Wilkins outta the running.

671
00:57:02.587 --> 00:57:06.457
Let me ask y'all. do we
wanna lose Miss Wilkins?

672
00:57:06.457 --> 00:57:07.558
- No.

673
00:57:07.558 --> 00:57:08.993
- No. sir.

674
00:57:08.993 --> 00:57:12.396
- Today. I received a
letter that commissions

675
00:57:12.396 --> 00:57:14.899
Mary Wilkins as an officer.

676
00:57:17.502 --> 00:57:19.570
- This ever been done before?

677
00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:22.172
- No it has not. but
it took a piece of work

678
00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:23.273
to get this done.

679
00:57:24.742 --> 00:57:27.311
I'm presenting this letter
to Mary in a few minutes.

680
00:57:27.311 --> 00:57:29.480
and I would love for
y'all to join me.

681
00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.615
- Well certainly. sir.

682
00:57:30.615 --> 00:57:31.916
- Okay. let's do it.

683
00:57:34.785 --> 00:57:36.754
- Something wrong. Sergeant?

684
00:57:36.754 --> 00:57:40.290
- Well. sir. I'm not one
to complain. but um ...

685
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.059
- Yes. Soldier?

686
00:57:42.059 --> 00:57:44.662
- Sir. I believe I've been
qualified for promotion

687
00:57:44.662 --> 00:57:46.296
for several years now.

688
00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:50.134
I'm just wondering. why
have I been passed over?

689
00:57:50.134 --> 00:57:53.037
- I would need a letter of
recommendation. Sergeant Major.

690
00:57:54.271 --> 00:57:55.640
- I would do it.

691
00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.407
- Find another
officer to sign off.

692
00:57:58.776 --> 00:57:59.977
- You?

693
00:57:59.977 --> 00:58:02.046
- Can't be me. You gotta
find somebody else.

694
00:58:04.414 --> 00:58:06.116
- Okay. sir. thank you.

695
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.023
- Mary Wilkins. for
outstanding service in support

696
00:58:13.023 --> 00:58:16.727
for the Army of Northern
Virginia. you have been

697
00:58:16.727 --> 00:58:19.129
commissioned to the
rank of captain.

698
00:58:27.572 --> 00:58:29.940
Is there anything you'd
like to say. Mary?

699
00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:32.376
- I sincerely appreciate
this opportunity. sir.

700
00:58:32.376 --> 00:58:36.180
and I am honored to
accept this commission.

701
00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:37.582
- You're supposed to salute.

702
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.396
- As a duly commissioned
officer. I would like

703
00:58:52.396 --> 00:58:54.865
to recommend
Sergeant Major Causey

704
00:58:54.865 --> 00:58:57.668
for promotion to officer rank.

705
00:58:57.668 --> 00:59:00.671
to be determined by
General Hampton. of course.

706
00:59:00.671 --> 00:59:02.840
- Well hell. I think
this is gonna work out.

707
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:09.113
- And Lord. please watch
over our house servant.

708
00:59:09.113 --> 00:59:13.317
Sarah Baker. who left this
world to join you last month.

709
00:59:15.052 --> 00:59:17.554
Christmas. 1863.

710
00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:19.456
The dinner will be
ready in a few minutes.

711
00:59:19.456 --> 00:59:22.126
and I have really been
looking forward to this.

712
00:59:25.763 --> 00:59:28.298
Every year since
this war started.

713
00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:31.335
we've had a special guest
for Christmas dinner.

714
00:59:31.335 --> 00:59:35.740
This year. it's
Sergeant Major Causey.

715
00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:37.975
- Thank you for having me here.

716
00:59:37.975 --> 00:59:40.210
- One of my finest
cavalry soldiers.

717
00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:43.648
He's been with me from
Manassas to Gettysburg.

718
00:59:43.648 --> 00:59:45.282
and he's still with me.

719
00:59:45.282 --> 00:59:47.952
- It's been a privilege
serving with you. General.

720
00:59:47.952 --> 00:59:49.654
- So. Sergeant. tell
me about your people.

721
00:59:49.654 --> 00:59:51.388
Where are you from?

722
00:59:51.388 --> 00:59:54.692
- A small town right
up the road. Brunson.

723
00:59:54.692 --> 00:59:57.361
- The sergeant here can be a
real terror on the battlefield.

724
00:59:57.361 --> 00:59:59.196
- He fights like a wild animal.

725
00:59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.298
- Well. I don't
know about all that.

726
01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:03.500
- Boys. you're
embarrassing the sergeant.

727
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.703
Do tell me about your horse.

728
01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:07.838
- Yes. ma'am. His name's Walker.

729
01:00:07.838 --> 01:00:10.107
He's been with me
a good long while.

730
01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.109
- They both been
shot a couple times.

731
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.543
- Really?

732
01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:15.880
- Thankfully. it didn't
hit anything vital.

733
01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.282
- I hope you brought your
appetite with you. Sergeant.

734
01:00:18.282 --> 01:00:20.951
You're in a for a real treat.

735
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.753
- That's what I'm told.

736
01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.973
- See anything. General?

737
01:05:42.973 --> 01:05:45.075
- I seen a few skirmishes
over that way earlier.

738
01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:47.111
Here. you take a look.

739
01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:00.790
- General. we're ready to go.

740
01:06:02.226 --> 01:06:03.060
- Preston!

741
01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:05.629
- Preston.

742
01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:15.605
- Stay with me. Son.
Stay with me. Son.

743
01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:17.507
- I. I can't.

744
01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:26.450
- Wade!

745
01:06:33.957 --> 01:06:35.492
- Whoo.

746
01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:36.393
Whoo. whoo!

747
01:06:38.862 --> 01:06:39.929
- General. come on.

748
01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:47.604
- Get him up on the table. boys.

749
01:06:57.547 --> 01:06:58.615
Take that hat.

750
01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:06.590
- Turn him over.

751
01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.595
- All right. lay him up.

752
01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.103
Let me get in here.

753
01:07:19.103 --> 01:07:20.337
Oh. God.

754
01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:21.871
- We gotta get him
up on this side here.

755
01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:22.672
- Turn him over.

756
01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:45.662
- This is bad.

757
01:07:47.097 --> 01:07:49.599
It's not bleeding much. It
coulda been a lot worse.

758
01:07:58.375 --> 01:07:59.643
- Were you hit too. General?

759
01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:01.778
- I was not. but take
care of my boy Wade.

760
01:08:01.778 --> 01:08:02.746
- You sure you're okay?

761
01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:04.248
- I'm absolutely sure. ma'am.

762
01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:08.652
I gotta get back. My other
son's on the battlefield.

763
01:08:08.652 --> 01:08:10.354
He died. and I have
to get back to him.

764
01:08:10.354 --> 01:08:13.223
- We can patch him up for you.

765
01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:15.725
It will hurt. but we have
a little laudanum left.

766
01:08:15.725 --> 01:08:16.660
He should pull through.

767
01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.895
- Thank you. thank you so much.

768
01:08:26.002 --> 01:08:28.972
My dearest Mary.

769
01:08:28.972 --> 01:08:33.910
As I sit on the coast
of South Carolina.

770
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:38.215
looking out into all
of God's wondrous ways.

771
01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.685
I take time to reflect.

772
01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:47.357
The war is really not
going well for us.

773
01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:49.993
I'm okay. The men are fine.

774
01:08:51.195 --> 01:08:53.430
But. Mary. I have
some tragic news.

775
01:08:54.398 --> 01:08:58.935
Our son Preston. our son Preston

776
01:08:58.935 --> 01:09:01.171
was killed on a
battlefield today.

777
01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:07.110
And Wade fell over Preston
to try to protect him

778
01:09:08.445 --> 01:09:10.614
and was shot and
wounded in the back.

779
01:09:11.748 --> 01:09:15.952
Now. Wade the
Fourth will be fine.

780
01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:17.754
The doctors have told me that.

781
01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:21.825
But he couldn't save Preston.

782
01:09:21.825 --> 01:09:24.628
and he was shot down
right in front of me.

783
01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:29.699
And it hurt me more than
it did when Frank died.

784
01:09:31.368 --> 01:09:33.937
I mean. this was my son.

785
01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.907
And. Mary. he'll
never come back again.

786
01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:42.912
Say a prayer for him in church.

787
01:09:44.748 --> 01:09:47.384
I wish you were here. Mary.

788
01:09:51.455 --> 01:09:53.257
Give my love to the girls.

789
01:09:54.324 --> 01:09:56.092
There will be brighter days.

790
01:09:57.394 --> 01:09:58.495
I'm sure of it.

791
01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:02.866
All the best. and
I love you. Wade.

792
01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.881
- General Hampton.

793
01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:20.684
- Yes?

794
01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:24.153
- I heard about the
loss of your son.

795
01:10:25.589 --> 01:10:28.224
Please accept my deepest
sympathy and condolences.

796
01:10:29.526 --> 01:10:33.062
Is there anything that
I can do to help you?

797
01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:36.833
- When this started. how long
did you think this would last?

798
01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:39.235
- What. this engagement
at Burgess Mill?

799
01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:43.239
- No. sir. I mean
the war itself.

800
01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:44.974
.

801
01:10:46.843 --> 01:10:50.046
after talking with a
lotta people at the start.

802
01:10:50.046 --> 01:10:54.183
we thought it might
last up to a year maybe.

803
01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:55.919
- I believe you're correct.

804
01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.987
I just keep thinking.

805
01:10:57.987 --> 01:11:01.958
If the war would have
lasted a year. maybe two.

806
01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:03.693
Preston would still be with me.

807
01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.998
- Have you thought
anything about going home

808
01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:10.334
for Christmas this year?

809
01:11:11.735 --> 01:11:13.603
- I haven't given
much thought to it.

810
01:11:14.838 --> 01:11:16.406
It's not even November yet.

811
01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:19.609
- I think it might
be a good idea

812
01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:23.913
to consider going home and
spending time with your family.

813
01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:30.454
- Is that an order. sir?

814
01:11:30.454 --> 01:11:34.057
- Wade. it's not an
order. not at all.

815
01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:37.126
It's just a suggestion
from one old friend.

816
01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.763
who's concerned. to another.

817
01:11:41.365 --> 01:11:43.166
- I think it's a good idea.

818
01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:11.327
- Wade. you haven't
eaten any of your dinner.

819
01:12:12.396 --> 01:12:14.598
- I'm not really
hungry. Mary. thank you.

820
01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:18.802
- And you. Son. you've
hardly eaten anything at all.

821
01:12:19.903 --> 01:12:21.705
- I'm just not
hungry yet. Mother.

822
01:12:21.705 --> 01:12:24.007
You're not hungry
for Christmas dinner?

823
01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:28.211
- I'm sorry. Mother.

824
01:12:28.211 --> 01:12:32.081
I guess. I guess I'm
just missing Preston.

825
01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:35.018
- It's all right.
Wade. we all are.

826
01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.319
- Well. the good news is.
there's been a shipment

827
01:12:36.319 --> 01:12:38.622
of toys that have
arrived in the village.

828
01:12:38.622 --> 01:12:42.291
You can go and pass those out
to the children this evening.

829
01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.928
- Wade. would you
handle that for me?

830
01:12:44.928 --> 01:12:46.162
- Sure.

831
01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:49.365
- No. absolutely not.
It needs to be you.

832
01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:50.767
It's tradition.

833
01:12:50.767 --> 01:12:52.268
Besides. there's
someone in the village

834
01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:53.770
that's been asking for you.

835
01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:54.604
- Who?

836
01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:56.072
- Nathaniel.

837
01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:58.341
He's in very poor health.
and they don't think

838
01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:00.577
he's going to make
another Christmas.

839
01:13:01.845 --> 01:13:03.847
- I don't. I don't know.

840
01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:32.809
All right. let's go make
some children happy.

841
01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.544
and then I'll go see Nathaniel.

842
01:13:51.661 --> 01:13:53.329
- Good evening. sir.

843
01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:55.699
- Good to see you. Nathaniel.

844
01:13:55.699 --> 01:13:57.801
I understand you're
not feeling too well.

845
01:13:58.868 --> 01:13:59.669
- Yes. sir.

846
01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:04.173
I believe my time
is coming to an end.

847
01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:08.945
- What can I do for you?

848
01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:13.116
- Just wanna thank you. sir.

849
01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.052
- Whatever for?

850
01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:21.691
- I was told you
gave all the children

851
01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:24.393
something for Christmas.

852
01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:28.431
- Of course. we been doing
that for a long while.

853
01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.803
- That was very
good of you. sir.

854
01:14:35.338 --> 01:14:37.206
Do you remember

855
01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:39.543
the promise?

856
01:14:39.543 --> 01:14:41.811
- Promise? What
promise would that be?

857
01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:43.880
- An old promise.

858
01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:51.054
You was just a little boy.

859
01:14:54.758 --> 01:14:57.761
- I believe I
remember that promise.

860
01:14:59.763 --> 01:15:00.630
- Maybe 40.

861
01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:04.333
50 years ago.

862
01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:07.904
- I believe I promised
you that I'd treat

863
01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:09.739
your people better
than my daddy did.

864
01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:14.010
- That's right. You
kept that promise.

865
01:15:15.511 --> 01:15:17.413
- Do you know why I
kept that promise?

866
01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:19.949
- Why. sir?

867
01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:24.287
- Because. considering
it's the right thing to do.

868
01:15:24.287 --> 01:15:27.290
I've always considered
you my friend.

869
01:15:31.427 --> 01:15:32.796
Goodbye. my friend.
