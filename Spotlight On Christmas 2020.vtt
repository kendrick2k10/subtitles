-Who's this guy?
-Santa.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.304
Is he your favorite?

35
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:55.349

-There you are.
-Mom!

39
00:02:59.918 --> 00:03:01.833
Thank you.

40
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.531
I turned my back for one second.

41
00:03:05.097 --> 00:03:07.622
I'm sorry.
Have we met before?

42
00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:13.062
Oh. you know what. that's me.
Merry Christmas.

43
00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:46.530
Olivia?

44
00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:49.054
Janey. hi!

45
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:50.273
Come here.

46
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.406
Oh.

47
00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:54.277
I didn't know you were
coming for Christmas.

48
00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:55.191
Me neither.

49
00:03:55.278 --> 00:03:57.062
You know. I think
you've grown an inch

50
00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:58.760
since you last
visited me in LA.

51
00:03:58.847 --> 00:04:00.849
I'm actually the
shortest in fifth grade.

52
00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:02.242
But I make up
for it in spirit.

53
00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.678
I believe it.

54
00:04:03.765 --> 00:04:06.376
Mr. Porter says it's not the
size of the player that counts.

55
00:04:06.463 --> 00:04:08.465
it's the size of their game.

56
00:04:08.552 --> 00:04:09.901
Oh. thank you.

57
00:04:11.163 --> 00:04:12.948
Mom. look who it is!

58
00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:20.521
Olivia!

59
00:04:20.608 --> 00:04:21.957
Hi. mom.

60
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.352
We didn't realize
that you were coming.

61
00:04:25.395 --> 00:04:26.962
I wanted to see you guys.
I missed you.

62
00:04:27.049 --> 00:04:29.007
Well. we missed you too.

63
00:04:29.094 --> 00:04:31.793
How are you doing
with everything?

64
00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:33.360
Uh. great.

65
00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:36.493
You know. single
and ready to jingle.

66
00:04:36.537 --> 00:04:38.452
Just. you know.
I'm happy to be home.

67
00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:39.888
Maybe Liv can stay in my room.

68
00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:41.803
Then we can have sleepovers
every night.

69
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.065
I think your sister might need

70
00:04:43.152 --> 00:04:46.068
a little space to recover
after her travels.

71
00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:48.418
We kept your room
exactly the same.

72
00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:49.158
Thank you. mom.

73
00:04:49.245 --> 00:04:50.725
I'm sorry. I should have called.

74
00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:51.900
No. don't worry.

75
00:04:51.987 --> 00:04:54.381
This is the best surprise.

76
00:04:54.468 --> 00:04:55.860
Oh. and you can
help us make pie.

77
00:04:55.947 --> 00:04:57.253
Oh. I would love to.

78
00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:02.214
I'm so glad you're home.

79
00:05:03.172 --> 00:05:05.348
<i>Everyone's home

80
00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:08.003
Okay. come.

81
00:05:08.046 --> 00:05:09.178
Yes. okay.

82
00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:12.007
Wow. it looks amazing.

83
00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.925
This is so A-list.

84
00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:18.796
Oh. go ahead.
try it on.

85
00:05:30.678 --> 00:05:32.636
Oh wow.

86
00:05:33.637 --> 00:05:34.551
Do these look good?

87
00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:35.770
They sure do.

88
00:05:35.857 --> 00:05:37.511
Hey. and feel free
to borrow anything.

89
00:05:37.598 --> 00:05:38.816
It's a sister rule.

90
00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:40.905
Is this for me?

91
00:05:40.992 --> 00:05:44.169
Uh maybe. I guess
you'll have to wait and see.

92
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.966
Okay. I know
this isn't for me.

93
00:05:58.053 --> 00:05:59.620
What isn't for?

94
00:05:59.707 --> 00:06:01.186
Sorry.

95
00:06:01.273 --> 00:06:02.362
That's okay.

96
00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.800
Turns out. it's
not for me either.

97
00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.412
I know.

98
00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:10.979
You do?

99
00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:12.850
Yeah.

100
00:06:12.937 --> 00:06:15.070
Did mom tell you?

101
00:06:15.157 --> 00:06:17.289
And the girls at
school talk about it.

102
00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:20.031
And Twitter.
my Facebook news.

103
00:06:20.118 --> 00:06:21.772
Mrs. Taylor down the street.

104
00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:24.209
Well. they'll forget
about it by Christmas.

105
00:06:24.296 --> 00:06:26.037
Are you staying
until Christmas?

106
00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:27.125
Yeah. of course I am.

107
00:06:27.212 --> 00:06:27.996
Yes.

108
00:06:28.083 --> 00:06:29.476
Now let me unpack
a little more

109
00:06:29.563 --> 00:06:31.739
and I will meet you
in the kitchen.

110
00:06:31.826 --> 00:06:34.916
I'm so happy you're here.
we've missed you so much.

111
00:06:37.832 --> 00:06:39.573
I've missed you too.

112
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.409
We need to make sure
we have enough flour.

113
00:06:50.845 --> 00:06:53.021
But not too much flour.
that's kind of perfect.

114
00:06:53.108 --> 00:06:55.545
Okay. now the secret
is to work the pastry

115
00:06:55.632 --> 00:06:57.155
as little as possible.

116
00:06:57.242 --> 00:06:59.723
so that it stays tender
and flaky. okay?

117
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.943
What are you making.
Grandma Mary's pumpkin

118
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.554
or my personal favorite.
North Pole pie?

119
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:05.599
Pumpkin.

120
00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:07.688
That North Pole pie.
I begged your dad

121
00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:10.255
to give me the recipe.
but it was his secret.

122
00:07:10.342 --> 00:07:12.693
But maybe your sister
and I can figure out

123
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.956
how to cook it
while you're here.

124
00:07:15.043 --> 00:07:16.392
I love a challenge.

125
00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:20.614
There's eight days
until Christmas.

126
00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:23.268
so once Janey perfects
her pie crust recipe.

127
00:07:23.355 --> 00:07:25.183
we can start putting in orders.

128
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.794
This is just my practice pie.

129
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:29.623
Well. I hope we get
to practice eating it.

130
00:07:30.362 --> 00:07:31.799
Hang on a second.

131
00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:33.714
Does this recipe call
for regular milk

132
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:35.150
or condensed milk. hon?

133
00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:42.026
Uh. condensed.

134
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.941
Ugh. that's what
I was afraid of.

135
00:07:44.028 --> 00:07:45.943
I mean. I can just
go to the store.

136
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.292
It's kind of a
special ingredient.

137
00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:48.555
maybe get two cans.

138
00:07:48.642 --> 00:07:49.947
You can use the truck
while you're here.

139
00:07:50.034 --> 00:07:51.732
Wait. Dad's truck?

140
00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:53.342
You still have it?

141
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:03.091
No on will expect me in this.

00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:28.595

00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:31.032

Umm. 12.

00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:49.866
How's your family?

184
00:10:49.953 --> 00:10:51.999
Well. the kids have kids now

185
00:10:52.086 --> 00:10:53.609
and they're all
home for Christmas.

186
00:10:53.696 --> 00:10:56.568
Wow. well. tell everybody
that I said hello.

187
00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.005
I'll do that.

188
00:10:58.092 --> 00:10:59.746
That's 14.75.

189
00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:05.186
Thank you.

190
00:11:06.056 --> 00:11:07.971
Oh. and uh. one for you...

191
00:11:08.798 --> 00:11:10.974
and one for your sister.

192
00:11:11.061 --> 00:11:13.020
Merry Christmas. Gordon.

193
00:11:13.107 --> 00:11:14.369
Must be my lucky day.

194
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.028
Come on. come on...

195
00:11:25.249 --> 00:11:27.861
<i>♪ ♪</i>

196
00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:35.651
Need a hand?

197
00:11:37.392 --> 00:11:39.002
-Hey.
-Hey.

198
00:11:40.438 --> 00:11:42.005
Pop this for me?

199
00:11:42.092 --> 00:11:42.876
Uh. yeah.

200
00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:54.539
Sounds like it's
not turning over.

201
00:11:54.626 --> 00:11:59.370
which makes me think
it might be the starter.

202
00:12:00.807 --> 00:12:03.940
Yeah. think you're
going to need a tow.

203
00:12:04.027 --> 00:12:04.898
Oh my gosh.

204
00:12:04.985 --> 00:12:07.074
Things just go
from bad to worse.

205
00:12:07.161 --> 00:12:08.379
Snow getting to you already?

206
00:12:08.466 --> 00:12:10.425
Oh no. it's not that.

207
00:12:10.468 --> 00:12:12.079
It's just...

208
00:12:12.122 --> 00:12:13.167
What?

209
00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:14.211
I'm sure you've already heard.

210
00:12:14.298 --> 00:12:16.866
It's kind of all over
the entertainment shows.

211
00:12:17.693 --> 00:12:19.173
I don't watch much TV.

212
00:12:19.216 --> 00:12:22.350
I've got three channels and
two of them are the weather.

213
00:12:23.481 --> 00:12:24.918
Hey Jim. it's Casey.

214
00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:27.834
I'm at Gordon's Groceries

215
00:12:27.921 --> 00:12:30.619
with an old friend
and she needs a tow.

216
00:12:31.446 --> 00:12:33.013
An hour?

217
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.971
Yeah. no. I understand.

218
00:12:35.058 --> 00:12:36.103
Okay thanks. Jim.

219
00:12:39.193 --> 00:12:39.933
Better get walking.

220
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.631
I'm on a bit of
a timeline. so...

221
00:12:42.718 --> 00:12:44.154
It's pretty dark.

222
00:12:44.241 --> 00:12:46.461
Can I walk you home?

223
00:12:46.504 --> 00:12:47.462
Umm...

224
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.899
Yeah. that'd be great.

225
00:12:51.118 --> 00:12:52.815
Perfect.

226
00:12:52.859 --> 00:12:53.947
Okay.

227
00:13:09.876 --> 00:13:11.399
It's funny I bumped into you.

228
00:13:11.486 --> 00:13:14.445
I was just thinking I
needed some expert advice.

229
00:13:14.532 --> 00:13:16.143
Expert?

230
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.928
You know I only play a
genius in the movies. right?

231
00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:20.843
That's good enough for me.

232
00:13:28.198 --> 00:13:30.374
So. how
would you get a classroom

233
00:13:30.461 --> 00:13:32.637
<i>to focus on
Shakespearean classics?</i>

234
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:34.117
<i>I'm finding it challenging.</i>

235
00:13:34.204 --> 00:13:36.032
But the language.
it's so beautiful.

236
00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:37.947
It reads like a song.

237
00:13:38.034 --> 00:13:39.209
I know.

238
00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:41.646
But kids today. they're
different than we were.

239
00:13:41.733 --> 00:13:43.083
Or than you were.

240
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.388
How do you mean?

241
00:13:44.475 --> 00:13:46.042
I saw you in all your plays.

242
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:47.522
You were incredible.

243
00:13:47.565 --> 00:13:49.306
You knew all the words.

244
00:13:49.393 --> 00:13:50.525
It's not their fault. though.

245
00:13:50.612 --> 00:13:51.743
They're distracted.

246
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.181
Literally every answer
is at their fingertips.

247
00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.836
So analyzing a
Shakespearean sonnet?

248
00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.228
That's tough.

249
00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:00.883
But Shakespeare
isn't about answers.

250
00:14:00.927 --> 00:14:03.146
It's about an experience.

251
00:14:03.233 --> 00:14:05.714
When you say it like that.
they might actually listen.

252
00:14:09.109 --> 00:14:11.546
Your family sure loves getting
in the Christmas spirit.

253
00:14:11.633 --> 00:14:13.374
Yeah. they sure do.

254
00:14:14.897 --> 00:14:16.116
Is it too much?

255
00:14:16.203 --> 00:14:18.292
No. never too much Christmas.

256
00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:20.511
You should see my place.

257
00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:26.474
Well. I'd better get going.

258
00:14:27.562 --> 00:14:28.868
It was nice seeing you.

259
00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:33.960
Bye. Liv.

260
00:14:35.613 --> 00:14:37.615
Uh. Casey?

261
00:14:37.702 --> 00:14:38.878
Yeah?

262
00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:43.578
Thank you for helping
with the truck.

263
00:14:43.665 --> 00:14:46.407
Maybe I could visit your
students to repay you.

264
00:14:46.494 --> 00:14:48.496
Classroom 120.
Monday to Friday.

265
00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:50.846
pretty much all the time.

266
00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:53.893
120. anytime.

267
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.068
Got it.

268
00:15:22.486 --> 00:15:23.444
Hmm.

269
00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:33.236
What day is it today?

270
00:15:33.323 --> 00:15:34.977
The 17th?

271
00:15:35.064 --> 00:15:36.936
Only eight days
until Christmas.

272
00:15:37.023 --> 00:15:38.111
Oh my gosh.

273
00:15:39.808 --> 00:15:41.723
So pretty.

274
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.333
-There you go.
-Thank you.

275
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.988
Mom. Dad. Liv's back.

276
00:15:50.775 --> 00:15:52.212
Olivia. welcome.

277
00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:54.127
John. hi.

278
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.129
Your mother was worried.

279
00:15:56.216 --> 00:15:57.130
I was not.

280
00:15:58.261 --> 00:15:59.436
What happened?

281
00:15:59.523 --> 00:16:01.482
Oh. the truck broke down.

282
00:16:01.569 --> 00:16:03.092
Oh honey. I'm sorry.

283
00:16:03.179 --> 00:16:05.399
It's had problems starting
over the last little while.

284
00:16:05.486 --> 00:16:06.835
No. it's okay.

285
00:16:06.878 --> 00:16:08.793
I really enjoyed my walk home
and the tow truck company

286
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.491
will be giving you
a call tonight.

287
00:16:10.578 --> 00:16:12.493
Well. thank you for
sorting that all out.

288
00:16:13.798 --> 00:16:14.930
And the pie patrol calls.

289
00:16:15.017 --> 00:16:16.758
There is a certain young baker

290
00:16:16.845 --> 00:16:18.629
who is thrilled
to have you home.

291
00:16:20.066 --> 00:16:21.371
We all are.

292
00:16:22.372 --> 00:16:24.200
Mom. how many pairs
of Clarisse Christiansen boots

293
00:16:24.244 --> 00:16:25.332
do you own?

294
00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:26.463
Who?

295
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.118
That is what I thought.

296
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:30.946
Thank you for getting
the groceries. honey.

297
00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:32.208
Oh. yes.

298
00:16:32.252 --> 00:16:33.557
It's just really nice
being out just shopping.

299
00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:35.211
Yeah? Did anyone recognize you?

300
00:16:35.298 --> 00:16:36.691
No.

301
00:16:36.778 --> 00:16:38.475
Well. actually
everybody recognized me.

302
00:16:38.562 --> 00:16:40.521
but not because they've seen me.
because they know me.

303
00:16:40.608 --> 00:16:42.001
That must be a welcome change.

304
00:16:42.088 --> 00:16:43.263
Yeah. it really was.

305
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.265
Good. Well. dinner's
in half an hour.

306
00:16:55.231 --> 00:16:58.582
<i>Janey has not stopped
talking about Perminator.</i>

307
00:16:58.626 --> 00:16:59.714
It was so lucky
that she could come

308
00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:02.543
and go to the premier with you
and walk the red carpet.

309
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.980
We loved it...
we saw it five times.

310
00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:06.764
You saw a movie
about a super girl

311
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:10.159
who uses a curling iron
to fight evil five times?

312
00:17:10.246 --> 00:17:13.293
I thought it was full
of remarkable messages

313
00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:15.469
for young girls Janey's age.

314
00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:16.861
You have to fight for
what you believe in

315
00:17:16.948 --> 00:17:18.037
and our favorite.

316
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.997
you can still kick butt
on a bad hair day.

317
00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:25.131
I actually wrote that line in.

318
00:17:25.218 --> 00:17:28.047
I was trying to add
some depth. I guess.

319
00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:29.439
<i>I knew it!</i>

320
00:17:29.526 --> 00:17:32.355
Didn't I say. some of those
lines sound just like Olivia?

321
00:17:32.442 --> 00:17:34.488
You have always
been so talented.

322
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.143
So. Perminator 2?

323
00:17:38.231 --> 00:17:40.929
Yeah. maybe in the summer.

324
00:17:41.973 --> 00:17:43.888
You're not excited?

325
00:17:43.975 --> 00:17:44.976
Don't get me wrong.

326
00:17:45.064 --> 00:17:46.935
those movies are great.
but truthfully.

327
00:17:47.022 --> 00:17:50.808
they're just not
feeding my soul anymore.

328
00:17:50.895 --> 00:17:51.896
My manager. Laura.
keeps telling me

329
00:17:51.983 --> 00:17:53.637
that my dream role is
right around the corner.

330
00:17:53.724 --> 00:17:57.554
It just feels like
a very long corner.

331
00:17:59.295 --> 00:18:00.905
Judges...

332
00:18:00.992 --> 00:18:02.255
I present to you.

333
00:18:02.298 --> 00:18:04.387
Oh. thank you.

334
00:18:04.474 --> 00:18:06.128
In the tradition
of Grandmother Mary.

335
00:18:06.172 --> 00:18:08.261
Here. Mom.

336
00:18:08.348 --> 00:18:09.784
Thanks.

337
00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:12.395
Janey Wilson. were there
any particular difficulties

338
00:18:12.482 --> 00:18:14.963
you had to overcome in
this pumpkin pie challenge?

339
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.139
Yes. at a crucial step
in the recipe.

340
00:18:17.226 --> 00:18:19.054
halfway through. I
found myself missing

341
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:20.316
a key component.

342
00:18:20.403 --> 00:18:21.709
Do you mind if we--

343
00:18:21.796 --> 00:18:23.711
Luckily. I was
able to keep myself

344
00:18:23.798 --> 00:18:25.060
and my dough chill enough
while my assistant

345
00:18:25.147 --> 00:18:26.931
was able to secure
the secret ingredient.

346
00:18:27.018 --> 00:18:28.803
Well. and I just have to say

347
00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:31.762
that I find the presentation
of the whipped cream.

348
00:18:31.849 --> 00:18:33.112
like not just on top of the pie.

349
00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:35.244
but almost entirely
covering it

350
00:18:35.331 --> 00:18:37.464
is a brand new technique for me.

351
00:18:38.639 --> 00:18:40.249
Thank you.

352
00:18:40.293 --> 00:18:42.512
I like to give all of my dishes
a little step of my personality.

353
00:18:42.556 --> 00:18:44.819
Judges. if you will.

354
00:18:44.906 --> 00:18:48.953
Uh-huh. mmm-hmm.
firm. yet silky texture.

355
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.434
A delicious
combination of spices.

356
00:18:51.521 --> 00:18:53.828
And a rich flaky crust.

357
00:18:53.915 --> 00:18:56.744
Janey Wilson. this might
be the best piece of pie

358
00:18:56.831 --> 00:18:57.701
I've ever had.

359
00:18:57.788 --> 00:18:59.094
I second that.

360
00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:01.140
Grandma Mary. look out.

361
00:19:01.227 --> 00:19:02.663
Want to try it?

362
00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:04.665
Oh!

363
00:19:41.267 --> 00:19:42.529
So what do you think?

364
00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:44.357
Red plaid?

365
00:19:46.446 --> 00:19:47.273
Blue plaid?

366
00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:52.539
Good choice.

367
00:20:07.336 --> 00:20:08.294
There we go.

368
00:20:10.078 --> 00:20:11.384
It's looking pretty good.

369
00:20:11.471 --> 00:20:12.907
What do you think?

370
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.169
Ah!

371
00:20:17.694 --> 00:20:19.914
I like the red
plaid better. anyway.

372
00:20:37.236 --> 00:20:38.237
What?

373
00:20:40.848 --> 00:20:42.197
I can't believe this.

374
00:20:47.507 --> 00:20:48.812
Mom!

375
00:20:48.899 --> 00:20:50.031
John?

376
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.512
Hello?

377
00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.297
Could Ryan Wrangler
and Olivia O'Hara

378
00:21:38.384 --> 00:21:39.907
<i>be getting back together?</i>

379
00:21:39.994 --> 00:21:42.126
<i>Or is it splitsies
for both of them?</i>

380
00:21:43.258 --> 00:21:46.348
<i>Join us for an OK LA exclusive
as to what's in store</i>

<i></i>

383
00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:53.790
Olivia and I remain
the best of friends.

384
00:21:53.877 --> 00:21:54.748
She's a wonderful woman.

385
00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:57.185
I wouldn't be where
I am without her.

386
00:21:57.272 --> 00:21:59.796
She fully supports me
in my career.

387
00:21:59.883 --> 00:22:01.189
And new relationship.

388
00:22:03.713 --> 00:22:05.019
<i>In fact. she called me
last night</i>

389
00:22:05.106 --> 00:22:06.542
<i>to wish me a merry Christmas.</i>

390
00:22:06.629 --> 00:22:10.067

00:22:13.244 --> 00:22:14.898
<i>Download your copy at midnight.</i>

00:22:14.942 --> 00:22:16.335
<i>Guys. I've got to run.

394
00:22:16.422 --> 00:22:17.423
<i>Thank you. Ryan.</i>

395
00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:22.471
<i>Well. you heard it
from Ryan Wrangler's side.</i>

396
00:22:22.558 --> 00:22:25.996
<i>We'll let you know Olivia's
when we find her.</i>

397
00:22:35.658 --> 00:22:37.007
Oh. Mom.

398
00:22:47.975 --> 00:22:50.064
I can't believe you kept this.

399
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.895
Good morning. Mrs. McMillan.

400
00:23:38.982 --> 00:23:42.246
I'm here to visit Casey.
Mr. Rollins' English class.

401
00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:43.813
Room 120.

402
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.032
Great. do I need a...?

403
00:23:45.119 --> 00:23:46.294
You'll want a visitor's pass.

404
00:23:46.381 --> 00:23:47.426
Thank you.

405
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.822
Olivia O'Hara.

406
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:54.433
Hi. Mrs. McMillan.

407
00:23:55.259 --> 00:23:57.261
Olivia O'Hara.

408
00:23:57.305 --> 00:23:59.481
Oh. I haven't seen you in years.

409
00:23:59.525 --> 00:24:01.396
I mean. I see you
in all your movies.

410
00:24:01.483 --> 00:24:03.877
I love all your movies.

411
00:24:03.964 --> 00:24:05.052
Oh. thank you.

412
00:24:05.879 --> 00:24:08.011
My favorite one
is the one where you

413
00:24:08.098 --> 00:24:11.058
lead that group of
misfit astronauts to?

414
00:24:11.145 --> 00:24:12.146
Pluto.

415
00:24:12.189 --> 00:24:13.147
That's right. Pluto.

416
00:24:13.234 --> 00:24:14.453
The People and the Plutonians.

417
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.150
Oh. I just loved
you in that one.

418
00:24:16.237 --> 00:24:17.891
you were so fierce.

419
00:24:18.718 --> 00:24:21.416
To what do we owe the honor
of your presence?

420
00:24:21.503 --> 00:24:22.939
I'm actually at
the school to try

421
00:24:23.026 --> 00:24:24.854
and get Shakespeare
the attention he deserves.

422
00:24:24.898 --> 00:24:28.031
Well. if anyone can do that.
it's Olivia O'Hara.

423
00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:31.731
I'll always remember
you as our Juliet.

424
00:24:31.818 --> 00:24:33.254
Oh. such passion.

425
00:24:34.124 --> 00:24:36.039
Now get down there
and show the kids

426
00:24:36.083 --> 00:24:38.738
what it's like to never
give up on their dreams.

427
00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:40.000
Oh. yes.

428
00:24:57.713 --> 00:24:58.453
<i>Okay class...</i>

429
00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.499
<i>Phones down. books out.</i>

430
00:25:04.198 --> 00:25:09.246
Claudio says "Hero.
not thy image doth appear

431
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.859
in the rare semblance
that I loved it first."

432
00:25:15.122 --> 00:25:17.385
What's it mean? Anybody?

433
00:25:19.735 --> 00:25:21.868
It's okay not to
understand it the first time.

434
00:25:21.955 --> 00:25:24.044
That's the great thing
about old Willie Shakes.

435
00:25:24.087 --> 00:25:25.785
Makes us do our own thinking.

436
00:25:25.872 --> 00:25:27.482
Makes us ask questions.

437
00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:30.529
Makes us go digging
for that truth.

438
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:35.011
You know. Shakespeare
isn't about the answers. guys.

439
00:25:35.098 --> 00:25:36.578
It's about an experience.

440
00:25:37.448 --> 00:25:39.799
Well. I couldn't have
said it better myself.

441
00:25:44.412 --> 00:25:46.719
What fire is in mine ears?

442
00:25:46.806 --> 00:25:48.242
Can this be true?

443
00:25:48.329 --> 00:25:50.374
Contempt. farewell.

444
00:25:51.245 --> 00:25:55.902
No glory lives behind
the phone of such.

445
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.340
I will requite thee.

446
00:25:59.427 --> 00:26:00.994
Thank you. thank you.

447
00:26:01.908 --> 00:26:04.475
In the meantime.
some necessary questions

448
00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:06.434
of the play we
then to be considered.

449
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.092
Act four. scene one.

450
00:26:19.621 --> 00:26:21.928
And I'm sure you
remember the theater.

451
00:26:25.192 --> 00:26:27.542
Oh. it never gets old.

452
00:26:28.804 --> 00:26:31.198
You know. I think every
movie I've ever made

453
00:26:31.285 --> 00:26:33.330
has been an attempt
to recreate the feeling

454
00:26:33.417 --> 00:26:35.855
I first had right here.

455
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.771
And that is?

456
00:26:42.818 --> 00:26:45.604
Gallop a pace you
fiery-footed steeds.

457
00:26:47.518 --> 00:26:48.389
I miss it.

458
00:26:48.476 --> 00:26:51.827
The community. the creativity.

459
00:26:51.914 --> 00:26:54.221
It was magic.

460
00:26:56.353 --> 00:26:58.965
Well. you're not
going to like this then.

461
00:26:59.052 --> 00:27:01.228
We had to cancel
the Christmas Eve play.

462
00:27:01.315 --> 00:27:03.317
It's the first time
in the school's history.

463
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.535
I'm sorry.

464
00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:06.407
Cancel the Christmas Eve
play. why?

465
00:27:06.494 --> 00:27:08.278
Nicole. our drama teacher.

466
00:27:08.365 --> 00:27:09.802
she's on maternity leave.

467
00:27:09.889 --> 00:27:11.281
Us teachers. we tried
to rally together.

468
00:27:11.368 --> 00:27:13.936
but we couldn't pull it off.

469
00:27:14.023 --> 00:27:17.374
So there's no. there's
no drama teacher right now?

470
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:20.160
No. the kids just use it
as a study block.

471
00:27:22.075 --> 00:27:23.337
Well that won't do.

472
00:27:29.082 --> 00:27:30.692
Thank you again. Liv.

473
00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:31.954
You're really inspiring.

474
00:27:32.041 --> 00:27:33.521
Anytime.

475
00:27:33.564 --> 00:27:34.827
I hope you mean that.

476
00:27:38.569 --> 00:27:40.963
This went well. I take it?

477
00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:41.964
It did.

478
00:27:42.051 --> 00:27:43.444
Lovely seeing you again. Mrs. M.

479
00:27:43.531 --> 00:27:45.446
Our door is always open.

480
00:27:47.753 --> 00:27:48.971
Bye Casey.

481
00:27:49.668 --> 00:27:50.843
Bye Liv.

482
00:27:54.237 --> 00:27:55.369
New shirt?

483
00:27:56.196 --> 00:27:57.197
Hmm?

484
00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.286
Oh. yeah. you like it?

485
00:27:59.373 --> 00:28:00.896
I do.

486
00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:04.552
Nice to see a blossoming
friendship between you two.

487
00:28:04.639 --> 00:28:07.773
I have a feeling Olivia
could use that right now.

488
00:28:09.557 --> 00:28:12.212
Would you please take
these to recycling?

489
00:28:12.255 --> 00:28:13.169
As long as she's here.

490
00:28:13.256 --> 00:28:16.216
I don't want any
unpleasant reminders.

491
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.785
You know what that girl
could use right now?

492
00:28:19.872 --> 00:28:21.134
Hmm?

493
00:28:21.221 --> 00:28:23.876
A gorgeous old friend
to take her down memory lane.

494
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:28.794
Nothing cures heartbreak
like ice cream.

495
00:28:30.099 --> 00:28:31.797
Ice cream. huh?

496
00:28:31.884 --> 00:28:32.885
Go.

497
00:28:42.459 --> 00:28:43.722
Earning your keep?

498
00:28:43.809 --> 00:28:46.594
Umm. you could call it that.

499
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:48.639
Think you could sneak away
for a little break?

500
00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:50.685
What do you have in mind?

501
00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:53.209
To thank you for your
act of service this morning.

502
00:28:53.296 --> 00:28:55.298
they are serving
festive flavored milkshakes

503
00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:56.909
at the diner.

504
00:28:56.996 --> 00:28:58.693
But that was me
thanking you for yesterday.

505
00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.000
Milkshakes and
we'll call it even?

506
00:29:01.087 --> 00:29:02.871
Deal.

507
00:29:02.958 --> 00:29:03.872
I'll take that.

508
00:29:03.959 --> 00:29:04.917
Oh. thank you.

509
00:29:05.004 --> 00:29:06.005
I'll meet you in the truck.

510
00:29:06.092 --> 00:29:07.093
Okay.

511
00:29:17.016 --> 00:29:18.626
If there is ever an option.

512
00:29:18.713 --> 00:29:20.323
eggnog is the only answer.

513
00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:21.498
Oh. no. agree to disagree.

514
00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:23.109
chocolate and
peppermint together...

515
00:29:24.327 --> 00:29:25.502
There's nothing better.

516
00:29:25.589 --> 00:29:26.286
Really?

517
00:29:26.373 --> 00:29:27.243
Want to trade?

518
00:29:44.957 --> 00:29:48.221
My dad used to bring me
here all the time.

519
00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:50.789
This place has not changed.

520
00:29:50.876 --> 00:29:53.139
Win or lose. we
treat the whole team

521
00:29:53.226 --> 00:29:54.096
after every game.

522
00:29:55.532 --> 00:29:56.925
He was a great guy.

523
00:29:57.012 --> 00:29:58.231
Incredible coach.

524
00:29:58.884 --> 00:30:00.581
He was an incredible father.

525
00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:10.852
So how long did you
say you were in town for?

526
00:30:10.939 --> 00:30:12.854
Just until things
calm down in LA.

527
00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:15.422
Or until they find me.

528
00:30:17.076 --> 00:30:18.468
Who's they?

529
00:30:18.555 --> 00:30:20.862
The paparazzi.

530
00:30:20.949 --> 00:30:22.864
Right now my personal
life's a bit. well.

531
00:30:22.908 --> 00:30:24.431
let's just say
Shakespeare would call it

532
00:30:24.518 --> 00:30:27.738
a comedy of errors
and that sells magazines.

533
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:29.349
Sorry. that stinks for you.

534
00:30:29.436 --> 00:30:33.135
To have to go through
everything so publicly.

535
00:30:34.267 --> 00:30:35.616
Like breakups?

536
00:30:37.879 --> 00:30:39.141
Hey. you're up.

537
00:30:39.228 --> 00:30:41.970
And that is why I cannot wait
for this cheeseburger.

538
00:30:42.057 --> 00:30:43.319
I'm looking forward to it

539
00:30:43.363 --> 00:30:46.845
almost as much as my mom's
Christmas marshmallow yams.

540
00:30:48.759 --> 00:30:50.936
Marshmallows on yams?

541
00:30:51.023 --> 00:30:51.806
Oh. absolutely.

542
00:30:51.893 --> 00:30:54.374
It's an O'Hara specialty.

543
00:30:54.461 --> 00:30:56.158
Sounds delicious. actually.

544
00:30:56.245 --> 00:30:57.725
And not too difficult.

545
00:30:57.812 --> 00:30:58.857
Do you cook?

546
00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.989
I reheat really well.

547
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:01.860
Okay.

548
00:31:03.774 --> 00:31:04.863
Honestly. I'm just so busy.

549
00:31:04.906 --> 00:31:06.429
The team practices most nights

550
00:31:06.473 --> 00:31:08.475
and on the weekends
we're traveling. so.

551
00:31:10.303 --> 00:31:14.350
So. I mean. do you have
someone special in your life?

552
00:31:14.437 --> 00:31:16.048
Yeah. you could say that.

553
00:31:17.179 --> 00:31:18.833
Amazing. Casey.
and you should.

554
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:22.793
We met a year ago
when I got back.

555
00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:24.795
And we have been
inseparable ever since.

556
00:31:24.839 --> 00:31:26.406
We don't speak the
same language. but.

557
00:31:26.493 --> 00:31:28.712
we have a deeper connection.

558
00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:29.931
A teacher?

559
00:31:29.975 --> 00:31:31.150
Not exactly.

560
00:31:31.237 --> 00:31:32.760
But I do learn
from her every day.

561
00:31:32.847 --> 00:31:33.892
How to play.

562
00:31:33.979 --> 00:31:35.589
How to love unconditionally.

563
00:31:35.676 --> 00:31:38.897
And how to hide milk bones
in between the couch cushions.

564
00:31:40.246 --> 00:31:43.205
Oh. you're talking
about your dog.

565
00:31:43.292 --> 00:31:45.164
Who'd you think I
was talking about?

566
00:31:48.384 --> 00:31:49.733
I work with Teach for America.

567
00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.257
so I get transferred
to a new city

568
00:31:51.344 --> 00:31:53.955
and a new school
every two years.

569
00:31:54.042 --> 00:31:57.263
It's really rewarding.
but it's a little hard

570
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.439
to give a relationship
what it deserves

571
00:31:59.526 --> 00:32:02.181
when you're always on the move.

572
00:32:02.268 --> 00:32:03.922
Yeah. I get that.

573
00:32:04.009 --> 00:32:06.446
I travel for work too. a lot.

574
00:32:06.533 --> 00:32:09.318
It's a juggling act.
career and love.

575
00:32:09.405 --> 00:32:10.537
I've always been so driven.

576
00:32:10.624 --> 00:32:13.366
I think it's something
that people find intimidating.

577
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.890
No. it's not intimidating.

578
00:32:15.977 --> 00:32:17.413
It's inspiring.

579
00:32:21.852 --> 00:32:24.725
What's inspiring is what
you're doing at Eagle Heights.

580
00:32:24.812 --> 00:32:26.857
Now that takes bravery.

581
00:32:26.901 --> 00:32:28.772
No. I just hope I can
do enough for those kids.

582
00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:30.296
Drama was the first to go. but.

583
00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:33.995
with all of our busy schedules.
it's not the last.

584
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:36.824
Look. I know it's only
a week before Christmas.

585
00:32:36.867 --> 00:32:38.608
but I have an idea.

586
00:32:39.435 --> 00:32:41.916
Maybe I could pick up

587
00:32:42.003 --> 00:32:44.179
where Nicole left off
and help get

588
00:32:44.266 --> 00:32:45.746
the Christmas Eve
play back on its feet.

589
00:32:45.833 --> 00:32:47.052
Yeah?

590
00:32:47.139 --> 00:32:48.967
Yes.

591
00:32:49.054 --> 00:32:49.968
I'm in!

592
00:32:50.881 --> 00:32:52.883
That is fantastic.

593
00:32:52.927 --> 00:32:56.975
Double cheeseburgers.
double cheese. no tomato.

594
00:32:57.018 --> 00:32:59.368
cooked to perfection.

595
00:32:59.455 --> 00:33:01.022
That looks amazing.

596
00:33:02.023 --> 00:33:05.331
Sorry to bother you. but
can we have your autograph?

597
00:33:05.418 --> 00:33:07.376
Obviously dinner
is on the house.

598
00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.203
Of course.

599
00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.292
And thank you. Starla.

600
00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:12.686
I'm your biggest fan.

601
00:33:14.427 --> 00:33:15.471
Enjoy you two.

602
00:33:16.255 --> 00:33:17.125
Thank you.

603
00:33:18.997 --> 00:33:21.521
Hey. I didn't say that fame
didn't have its upsides.

604
00:33:30.921 --> 00:33:33.707
So. 6:30 a.m. pickup.

605
00:33:34.795 --> 00:33:36.492
Maybe wear comfortable shoes.

606
00:33:36.579 --> 00:33:37.798
What is wrong with these?

607
00:33:37.885 --> 00:33:38.973
They're Clarisse Christiansen.

608
00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.931
Olivia O'Hara.
no one from Colorado

609
00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:41.976
should be wearing
shoes like that

610
00:33:42.063 --> 00:33:43.630
in the middle of winter.

611
00:33:43.717 --> 00:33:45.414
Of course not.

612
00:33:45.501 --> 00:33:46.807
Get some rest.

613
00:33:46.894 --> 00:33:48.156
You're going to need it.

614
00:33:50.463 --> 00:33:51.290
Okay.

615
00:34:03.563 --> 00:34:04.346
Hey. Liv.

616
00:34:04.433 --> 00:34:06.566
How were the milkshakes?

617
00:34:06.653 --> 00:34:08.742
They were just as good
as I remember.

618
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:10.135
How's Mr. Rollins?

619
00:34:10.222 --> 00:34:14.400
Mr. Rollins is actually
driving me to school tomorrow.

620
00:34:14.487 --> 00:34:16.576
I'm helping to fill in
at the drama department

621
00:34:16.663 --> 00:34:19.057
and possibly direct
the Christmas Eve play.

622
00:34:19.144 --> 00:34:21.537
Well done. Liv.
back on the boards.

623
00:34:21.624 --> 00:34:23.713
That's wonderful honey.

624
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.758
Thanks.

625
00:34:24.845 --> 00:34:26.281
I made this one for you.

626
00:34:26.368 --> 00:34:28.109
It's a star. like you.

627
00:34:28.196 --> 00:34:30.807
It's beautiful. thank you.

628
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:32.592
Hey. where should I put it?

629
00:34:34.855 --> 00:34:37.205
Somewhere by a Christmas light.
so it sparkles.

630
00:34:37.292 --> 00:34:40.861
Okay. how about there?

631
00:34:41.731 --> 00:34:42.863
That's perfect.

632
00:34:45.518 --> 00:34:47.737
Huh. is this a hotel key card?

633
00:34:47.824 --> 00:34:49.826
Yeah. this is
the weirdest thing.

634
00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:52.829
I don't know how it
ended up in our backyard.

635
00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:55.136
Pine Point Hotel.

636
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.268
Where is that?

637
00:34:56.355 --> 00:34:57.878
Pine Point.

638
00:34:57.965 --> 00:34:59.271
I think that's the new hotel

639
00:34:59.358 --> 00:35:01.360
that just opened
up downtown. fancy.

640
00:35:01.447 --> 00:35:04.145
The paparazzi
might know I'm here.

641
00:35:04.232 --> 00:35:05.190
Right.

642
00:35:54.587 --> 00:35:55.457
Hi.

643
00:35:55.544 --> 00:35:57.851
Yeah. just let me
grab a pen quick.

644
00:36:28.969 --> 00:36:31.058
Laura. hey. it's Olivia.

645
00:36:31.145 --> 00:36:33.147
There's a paparazzi
there's Stephanie Mitchell

646
00:36:33.234 --> 00:36:35.367
from Universal Star
magazine in my hometown.

647
00:36:35.454 --> 00:36:38.065
Whatever story
she's writing. end it.

648
00:36:38.152 --> 00:36:39.458
End it now.

649
00:36:52.601 --> 00:36:54.647
Oh. it's so cold.

650
00:36:54.734 --> 00:36:56.214
Morning Ms. Director.
how was your sleep?

651
00:36:56.301 --> 00:36:58.433
Oh. I just. you know.
need a coffee.

652
00:36:58.477 --> 00:37:00.348
I have it.

653
00:37:00.435 --> 00:37:02.002
Oh. thank you.

654
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:03.308
So nice.

655
00:37:07.442 --> 00:37:08.748
<i>Olivia!</i>

656
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:11.577
Hi. how are you?

657
00:37:11.664 --> 00:37:12.882
Better now.

658
00:37:14.449 --> 00:37:16.756
There's no way I could
ever thank you enough.

659
00:37:16.843 --> 00:37:18.758
You are a Christmas miracle.

660
00:37:19.715 --> 00:37:21.326
But. cookies?

661
00:37:22.196 --> 00:37:24.198
Oh my gosh. two boys
and one on the way.

662
00:37:24.285 --> 00:37:26.069
where do you find
the time to make these?

663
00:37:26.156 --> 00:37:27.027
During the holidays.

664
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.420
we turn them into
an assembly line.

665
00:37:28.507 --> 00:37:30.204
One cuts the shapes and frosts.

666
00:37:30.291 --> 00:37:32.467
and the youngest one
mostly just makes a mess.

667
00:37:33.642 --> 00:37:35.209
So. I talked to
Nicole last night.

668
00:37:35.296 --> 00:37:36.210
They were halfway
through rehearsals.

669
00:37:36.297 --> 00:37:38.560
so you can just pick up
where she left off.

670
00:37:38.647 --> 00:37:39.909
This is the most
amazing thing

671
00:37:39.996 --> 00:37:41.259
that's happened all year.

672
00:37:41.346 --> 00:37:42.390
The students will love you.

673
00:37:42.477 --> 00:37:44.436
Oh. we'll see about that.

674
00:37:44.523 --> 00:37:45.219
They will.

675
00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:46.481
This whole town loves you.

676
00:37:46.568 --> 00:37:48.918
Ever since you stole our hearts
in the spring play.

677
00:37:49.005 --> 00:37:49.919
Are you kidding me?

678
00:37:50.006 --> 00:37:50.964
I looked up to you.

679
00:37:51.051 --> 00:37:52.357
You were the star of that show.

680
00:37:52.444 --> 00:37:54.924
I remember being so
moved by your solo.

681
00:37:55.011 --> 00:37:56.883
Well. at the time I
could hit the high E.

682
00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:58.319
but I don't know.

683
00:37:58.406 --> 00:38:01.104
When you stepped on stage.
you just had "it."

684
00:38:02.323 --> 00:38:04.238
This is the
Christmas Eve playbook.

685
00:38:04.325 --> 00:38:07.937
tech cues and
everything else you'll need.

686
00:38:08.024 --> 00:38:10.505
I can't wait to see
what you come up with.

687
00:38:10.592 --> 00:38:12.464
And. of course. if you
have any questions at all.

688
00:38:12.551 --> 00:38:13.987
I am only a phone call away.

689
00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:16.424
Thank you. Olivia.

690
00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.644
Well. thank you
for the cookies.

691
00:38:18.731 --> 00:38:19.993
Thank the boys.

692
00:38:23.692 --> 00:38:25.259
Bye Nicole.

693
00:38:27.827 --> 00:38:29.481
I'm just down the hall.

694
00:38:29.568 --> 00:38:30.612
You're going to do great.

695
00:38:35.878 --> 00:38:37.010
Break a leg.

696
00:38:57.378 --> 00:38:59.075
Hi Oliv--. oh. Ms. O'Hara.

697
00:38:59.162 --> 00:39:01.208
I'm Gabby. I was
Mrs. Hudson's assistant

698
00:39:01.295 --> 00:39:04.167
and I'd be really honored
to continue doing that job.

699
00:39:04.254 --> 00:39:05.908
Oh. sure.

700
00:39:05.995 --> 00:39:08.389
Great. I will take this
and put this on your desk.

701
00:39:08.433 --> 00:39:10.130
which is right here.

702
00:39:10.217 --> 00:39:11.610
Here is the class list.

703
00:39:11.697 --> 00:39:13.307
Oh. thank you.

704
00:39:13.394 --> 00:39:14.917
Hello everyone.

705
00:39:15.004 --> 00:39:17.703
My name is Ms. O'Hara.
but you can call me Olivia.

706
00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:21.315
Great... okay.

707
00:39:21.402 --> 00:39:22.577
Umm...

708
00:39:22.621 --> 00:39:24.753
Well. we have Gabby.

709
00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.276
Is there a Brittany?

710
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.889
Brittany? Hi. Brittany.
Uh. Chris?

711
00:39:30.846 --> 00:39:33.327
Chris. yes. I like it.

712
00:39:33.414 --> 00:39:34.372
Jack?

713
00:39:36.809 --> 00:39:38.941
Jack Carson?

714
00:39:38.985 --> 00:39:42.075
Well. Jack Carson
comes whenever he wants.

715
00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:46.427
Okay. well. most
of you are here.

716
00:39:46.514 --> 00:39:49.561
So. you know what.
let's get started with a warmup.

717
00:39:49.648 --> 00:39:51.171
If everyone can
take off their bags

718
00:39:51.258 --> 00:39:52.999
and just meet me on stage.

719
00:39:57.264 --> 00:39:58.439
Oh hey. you must be Jack.

720
00:39:58.526 --> 00:40:01.007
we're just getting started
if you'd like to join us.

721
00:40:02.965 --> 00:40:04.097
All right.

722
00:40:06.665 --> 00:40:09.232
So. there's something
else we have to take off.

723
00:40:09.319 --> 00:40:10.538
Our cool.

724
00:40:10.625 --> 00:40:13.411
This is a place to be open.
be free. to be you.

725
00:40:14.803 --> 00:40:16.414
Nicole did a great job
with the play already.

726
00:40:16.457 --> 00:40:17.415
They're almost off book.

727
00:40:17.502 --> 00:40:18.764
I taught them a little trick

728
00:40:18.851 --> 00:40:20.287
to help them
memorize their lines

729
00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:22.855
and they seem to like it.

730
00:40:22.942 --> 00:40:24.073
You are a natural.

731
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.033
Well. I couldn't get Jack Carson
to join in. but...

732
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.470
Jack's a tough one
to get through to.

733
00:40:29.557 --> 00:40:31.559
Lost his dad last year.

734
00:40:32.386 --> 00:40:34.214
You know. I think
you might the one

735
00:40:34.301 --> 00:40:36.346
who can finally reach him.

736
00:40:36.434 --> 00:40:37.870
Me?

737
00:40:37.957 --> 00:40:39.393
I want to show you something.

738
00:40:51.057 --> 00:40:52.928
Your mom presents it every year.

739
00:40:55.104 --> 00:40:56.628
I had no idea.

740
00:40:59.935 --> 00:41:01.459
This is amazing.

741
00:41:03.896 --> 00:41:07.465
He was so supportive
and generous.

742
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.990
Well. the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

743
00:41:19.389 --> 00:41:20.782
Excuse me.

744
00:41:24.917 --> 00:41:26.571
I'll see you tomorrow.

745
00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:28.486
See you tomorrow.

746
00:41:42.804 --> 00:41:44.502
Okay. do you have the tape?

747
00:41:46.591 --> 00:41:49.202
Are all of these for Janey?

748
00:41:49.289 --> 00:41:52.597
I know. I just
can't help myself.

749
00:41:52.684 --> 00:41:54.294
I hope my online
shopping makes it on time.

750
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:57.036
I managed to bring
a few things from LA.

751
00:41:57.123 --> 00:41:59.386
Your presence is our present.

752
00:42:01.823 --> 00:42:04.478
I forgot how special it feels
to be home for Christmas.

753
00:42:04.565 --> 00:42:05.871
Yeah.

754
00:42:05.958 --> 00:42:07.525
Hawaii was nice with
everyone a couple of years ago.

755
00:42:07.612 --> 00:42:10.397
But the surfing Santas
don't really cut it. do they?

756
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.311
No.

757
00:42:12.965 --> 00:42:14.183
You know...

758
00:42:14.488 --> 00:42:16.011
I just had this story in my head

759
00:42:16.098 --> 00:42:19.406
that I couldn't be at home
at Christmas without dad.

760
00:42:19.493 --> 00:42:22.322
Yeah. I understand.

761
00:42:22.409 --> 00:42:24.933
You know. I've learned
that Christmas

762
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.546
really is a time when we
can be with everybody again.

763
00:42:28.633 --> 00:42:32.550
even if it's just in memories
or. you know. traditions.

764
00:42:35.074 --> 00:42:36.075
Who can that be?

765
00:42:44.736 --> 00:42:45.563
Whoa.

766
00:42:46.476 --> 00:42:48.740
John has good taste.

767
00:42:48.783 --> 00:42:50.437
They're for you.

768
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.570
What?

769
00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:57.052
They're from Ryan.

770
00:42:59.707 --> 00:43:00.752
I haven't heard from him

771
00:43:00.839 --> 00:43:02.580
since he broke up our
engagement over text.

772
00:43:02.667 --> 00:43:04.277
Honey. I'm so sorry.

773
00:43:07.497 --> 00:43:08.455
It's okay.

774
00:43:09.674 --> 00:43:11.284
We had been drifting apart
for a while

775
00:43:11.371 --> 00:43:14.461
and our schedules were
never really matching up.

776
00:43:15.636 --> 00:43:17.333
He wasn't always
so into being famous.

777
00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:23.296
He was really sweet and humble
and he would write these songs.

778
00:43:23.383 --> 00:43:24.602
But now he's just...

779
00:43:26.386 --> 00:43:27.735
So. are you going
to let him know

780
00:43:27.822 --> 00:43:29.302
that you got his flowers?

781
00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:32.566
I...

782
00:43:32.653 --> 00:43:34.960
I don't know how I
feel about all this.

783
00:43:35.047 --> 00:43:36.831
I want to be home for Christmas

784
00:43:36.875 --> 00:43:38.833
and focus on the students
and the play.

785
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:43.272
You know. whenever life
has handed you a challenge.

786
00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:45.274
you have always
managed to turn it

787
00:43:45.361 --> 00:43:46.972
into something just magical.

788
00:43:48.234 --> 00:43:49.714
And that is exactly
what you're doing

789
00:43:49.801 --> 00:43:51.759
with this play at the school.

790
00:43:53.543 --> 00:43:54.414
I hope so.

791
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:55.633
Oh. it is honey.

792
00:43:56.546 --> 00:43:57.591
I can feel it.

793
00:44:00.681 --> 00:44:02.204
You want a hot chocolate?

794
00:44:02.291 --> 00:44:03.728
Yeah. that'd be fine.

795
00:44:25.227 --> 00:44:26.576
Welcome back.

796
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.144
I'd like to have a
spectacular ending.

797
00:44:29.231 --> 00:44:31.320
I want the audience
talking about the finale

798
00:44:31.407 --> 00:44:33.888
into the new year and
I'm open to suggestions.

799
00:44:33.975 --> 00:44:36.369
Maybe we could have
snow falling on the stage.

800
00:44:36.412 --> 00:44:37.892
That's a great idea.

801
00:44:37.979 --> 00:44:40.068
Yes. Brittany?

802
00:44:40.112 --> 00:44:41.504
Well. I'm just
hoping I don't freeze

803
00:44:41.548 --> 00:44:42.723
and forget everything.

804
00:44:42.767 --> 00:44:43.506
You won't.

805
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:44.551
We'll keep practicing.

806
00:44:44.594 --> 00:44:46.596
It's going to be fantastic.

807
00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.338
I'd be willing to
sing a solo or two.

808
00:44:49.382 --> 00:44:50.731
Okay.

809
00:44:52.777 --> 00:44:55.083
Jack. you could
at least applaud

810
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.824
every now and then
if you're just going

811
00:44:56.911 --> 00:44:58.565
to be an audience member.

812
00:45:05.267 --> 00:45:07.748
Jack. can I see you
in the hallway. please?

813
00:45:07.835 --> 00:45:08.706
Now.

814
00:45:13.798 --> 00:45:16.409
I'm just. uh.
keep practicing everyone.

815
00:45:25.548 --> 00:45:27.942
Jack. this is an
elective you selected

816
00:45:27.986 --> 00:45:29.639
for the semester.

817
00:45:29.683 --> 00:45:30.902
If you don't want
to participate.

818
00:45:30.945 --> 00:45:32.599
then why are you here?

819
00:45:32.642 --> 00:45:33.643
Easy A.

820
00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:35.602
Okay well. right now
you're on track

821
00:45:35.645 --> 00:45:37.082
for an easy F.

822
00:45:37.169 --> 00:45:38.083
Whatever.

823
00:45:39.127 --> 00:45:43.088
Look. I know high school
isn't easy for anyone

824
00:45:43.131 --> 00:45:45.481
and I know it's hard
to put your heart

825
00:45:45.525 --> 00:45:46.439
into anything
after it's been--

826
00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:47.788
You don't know me.

827
00:45:47.832 --> 00:45:49.485
You're right. I don't.

828
00:45:50.443 --> 00:45:53.620
But. I think I might
be able to relate

829
00:45:53.663 --> 00:45:55.274
to what you're going through.

830
00:45:57.319 --> 00:45:58.320
Have you ever heard of the

831
00:45:58.364 --> 00:46:00.627
Michael O'Hara
Memorial Scholarship?

832
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:01.846
Of course.

833
00:46:01.933 --> 00:46:03.325
That's my dad.

834
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.938
We lost him my senior year
right around this time.

835
00:46:09.723 --> 00:46:10.942
I miss him every day.

836
00:46:13.945 --> 00:46:16.469
If you don't want to
perform in the play.

837
00:46:16.556 --> 00:46:18.297
that's fine.

838
00:46:18.384 --> 00:46:21.561
But you can't just
sit in the back.

839
00:46:21.648 --> 00:46:22.518
You have to move forward.

840
00:46:22.605 --> 00:46:25.304
even if it's with
small steps to start.

841
00:46:30.004 --> 00:46:31.658
What am I supposed to do?

842
00:46:34.574 --> 00:46:36.706
Well umm. we could really use

843
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:40.667
a hair and makeup person.
or a costumes captain.

844
00:46:40.754 --> 00:46:41.929
I like music.

845
00:46:42.016 --> 00:46:42.800
Okay.

846
00:46:42.887 --> 00:46:45.803
Okay music. that's great.

847
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.369
We could really
use a soundtrack.

848
00:46:47.413 --> 00:46:48.501
Christmas carols?

849
00:46:48.544 --> 00:46:49.937
Okay. yeah.

850
00:46:50.024 --> 00:46:50.938
I don't know.

851
00:46:52.374 --> 00:46:53.506
I make beats.

852
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:54.637
Yes. okay.

853
00:46:54.724 --> 00:46:58.163
How about some carols
and some original music?

854
00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:59.555
Yeah. maybe.

855
00:46:59.642 --> 00:47:02.994
Okay. and. maybe
you could bring in

856
00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:06.127
some recordings by
like the end of the week?

857
00:47:06.171 --> 00:47:07.172
Sure.

858
00:47:08.216 --> 00:47:09.000
Okay.

881

Olivia?

882
00:49:10.208 --> 00:49:11.165
The show's tomorrow

883
00:49:11.252 --> 00:49:12.862
and we don't have
a Santa costume.

884
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.864
The school doesn't have
any costumes in storage?

885
00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:17.041
Maybe I can make a beard
with cotton balls?

886
00:49:17.084 --> 00:49:19.652
I will go out and pick up
everything we need.

887
00:49:19.695 --> 00:49:20.827
We need a lot.

888
00:49:20.914 --> 00:49:23.743
It'll be my Christmas present
to the class.

889
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:25.266
Okay?

890
00:49:25.353 --> 00:49:28.139
Hey everyone.
thank you so much

891
00:49:28.226 --> 00:49:29.618
for all your hard work.

892
00:49:29.705 --> 00:49:31.794
I am so excited to see you
up there on the big stage

893
00:49:31.838 --> 00:49:32.665
of the community hall.

894
00:49:32.752 --> 00:49:34.667
Whatever your department needs.

895
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:35.973
write it down on Gabby's list

896
00:49:36.016 --> 00:49:38.323
and I will take care
of everything.

897
00:49:39.498 --> 00:49:40.455
Got this.

898
00:49:54.774 --> 00:49:57.342
And yes. you too.
have a Merry Christmas.

899
00:49:57.385 --> 00:49:58.691
Thank you. take care.

900
00:49:58.778 --> 00:50:01.737
First one in. last one out.
Mr. Rollins?

901
00:50:01.781 --> 00:50:04.262
I had to squeeze
in one last practice.

902
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:05.872
And...

903
00:50:06.916 --> 00:50:08.701
Merry Christmas.

904
00:50:08.788 --> 00:50:11.747
Thank you for coming in
on Saturdays for our games.

905
00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:13.923
Oh Casey. you shouldn't have.

906
00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:15.360
but I'll take it. thank you.

907
00:50:17.405 --> 00:50:20.017
Is there anyone else special
on your list this year?

908
00:50:21.409 --> 00:50:22.454
Like?

909
00:50:23.324 --> 00:50:26.371
I've seen the way you
and Olivia look at each other.

910
00:50:28.938 --> 00:50:31.898
I'm not a celebrity.
and she's a movie star.

911
00:50:31.985 --> 00:50:33.682
She's also jut a girl
trying to find

912
00:50:33.726 --> 00:50:36.076
her way in the world.

913
00:50:36.163 --> 00:50:39.123
You're a great guy Casey. and
I know teaching fulfills you.

914
00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:42.778
but I'm afraid you don't
know what you're missing.

915
00:50:42.822 --> 00:50:45.999
I stopped by the rehearsal room.
she wasn't there.

916
00:50:46.913 --> 00:50:49.916
I'd check the diner.
if I were you.

917
00:50:51.787 --> 00:50:54.355
Some things are
worth fighting for.

918
00:50:54.442 --> 00:50:57.445
And there's no better
time than Christmas

919
00:50:57.489 --> 00:50:59.404
for a little magic.

920
00:51:01.971 --> 00:51:03.060
Thank you.

921
00:51:11.981 --> 00:51:13.070
Thank you.

922
00:51:43.535 --> 00:51:45.145
Hi there. Stephanie.

923
00:51:45.189 --> 00:51:45.928
Hand over the camera.

924
00:51:46.015 --> 00:51:46.973
No!

925
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.327
Thank you. Starla.

926
00:51:53.371 --> 00:51:55.155
No one messes with our Olivia.

927
00:51:55.242 --> 00:51:56.983
-You got this?
-Yeah. I do.

928
00:52:01.901 --> 00:52:05.034
Huh. this is heavier
than I expected.

929
00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:05.992
Feels expensive.

930
00:52:06.035 --> 00:52:07.994
Yeah. so expensive.

931
00:52:08.037 --> 00:52:08.821
Can I have it back?

932
00:52:08.864 --> 00:52:11.215
I think I'll keep it.

933
00:52:11.302 --> 00:52:13.565
If I don't get a story
to my editor by Christmas.

934
00:52:13.652 --> 00:52:14.740
I will lose my job.

935
00:52:14.827 --> 00:52:17.351
Then you should have
chose another line of work.

936
00:52:17.395 --> 00:52:18.874
I went to journalism school.

937
00:52:18.918 --> 00:52:21.747
I wanted to tell stories
of hope and humanity.

938
00:52:21.834 --> 00:52:25.403
but this is what everyone wants.

939
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:27.840
To watch along as
my life implodes?

940
00:52:27.927 --> 00:52:28.841
It's not right!

941
00:52:28.928 --> 00:52:30.321
It's not.

942
00:52:30.408 --> 00:52:32.366
But the only stories
that sell more magazines

943
00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:34.368
are ones of redemption.
which is why

944
00:52:34.455 --> 00:52:37.371
I was trying to get some shots
of you and your new boyfriend.

945
00:52:37.415 --> 00:52:39.025
He's not my boyfriend.

946
00:52:43.072 --> 00:52:45.901
Okay. you can have
the camera back.

947
00:52:45.945 --> 00:52:48.556
if you turn over
everything you have on me.

948
00:52:48.643 --> 00:52:50.906
Photos. journals.
digital copies.

949
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:52.386
tell your editor
that I didn't come home.

950
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:54.388
I wasn't here.

951
00:52:54.432 --> 00:52:57.174
Please. come on.
this is my life.

952
00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:02.657
Okay...

953
00:53:02.744 --> 00:53:04.006
Deal.

954
00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:05.834
Deal.

955
00:53:09.969 --> 00:53:10.970
Clarisse Christiansen boots

956
00:53:11.057 --> 00:53:13.407
aren't made for
Colorado winters. are they?

957
00:53:13.451 --> 00:53:14.365
Tell me about it.

958
00:53:16.149 --> 00:53:17.368
Thank you. Stephanie.

959
00:53:25.289 --> 00:53:26.768
Thank you for
the backup. Starla.

960
00:53:26.812 --> 00:53:27.987
I'll take the check. please.

961
00:53:28.074 --> 00:53:28.901
Okay.

962
00:53:30.642 --> 00:53:32.339
Don't take too much
work home with you.

963
00:53:32.426 --> 00:53:33.645
Casey.

964
00:53:33.732 --> 00:53:36.430
Yeah well. you know. it's
a big show tomorrow night.

965
00:53:36.474 --> 00:53:37.953
Hey. listen.

966
00:53:37.997 --> 00:53:40.913
Since you're going to be busy
for the next couple of nights.

967
00:53:40.956 --> 00:53:43.959
maybe you'd like
to go out. tonight?

968
00:53:44.003 --> 00:53:47.049
Tonight. like a real date?

969
00:53:48.312 --> 00:53:51.706
Yeah tonight.
like a real date.

970
00:53:51.793 --> 00:53:53.099
Yeah. I'd love to.

971
00:53:55.667 --> 00:53:57.408
No. I have got this.

972
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:58.844
Technically. you
got the last one.

973
00:53:58.931 --> 00:54:01.281
I will pick you up at eight.

974
00:54:01.368 --> 00:54:02.891
Eight. I'll be ready.

975
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:13.598
No peeking...

976
00:54:15.469 --> 00:54:17.210
Oh. hi.

977
00:54:17.297 --> 00:54:18.777
Sorry.

978
00:54:18.864 --> 00:54:20.735
I thought it was your mom.

979
00:54:20.822 --> 00:54:23.347
She always knows what I'm
going to get her. every year.

980
00:54:23.434 --> 00:54:25.087
I don't know how she does it.

981
00:54:25.174 --> 00:54:29.744
She holds a gift.
she looks at it. she knows.

982
00:54:29.831 --> 00:54:32.617
This year my goal is
to actually surprise her.

983
00:54:36.316 --> 00:54:38.318
Wow. well. I mean.

984
00:54:38.405 --> 00:54:40.668
Whatever it is.
she's going to love it.

985
00:54:40.712 --> 00:54:42.279
Well good. because I love her.

986
00:54:43.541 --> 00:54:45.412
You really do.

987
00:54:45.499 --> 00:54:46.500
Yeah.

988
00:54:47.458 --> 00:54:49.982
Thank you for being there
for her when I couldn't.

989
00:54:50.025 --> 00:54:53.159
and for making her
so happy again.

990
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.555
I envy the kind of love
that you two have.

991
00:54:57.642 --> 00:54:59.296
It'll happen for you too. Liv.

992
00:55:00.558 --> 00:55:01.602
Thank you.

993
00:55:01.689 --> 00:55:02.821
Any time. kid.

994
00:55:05.737 --> 00:55:06.477
Honey. close the door.

995
00:55:06.564 --> 00:55:07.652
Yes. of course.

996
00:55:23.407 --> 00:55:24.321
Perfect...

997
00:55:26.714 --> 00:55:28.325
Smells good.

998
00:55:28.412 --> 00:55:29.848
I hope Olivia likes it.

999
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:36.333
See Dahl.

1000
00:55:38.639 --> 00:55:39.945
Wearing it.

1001
00:55:49.868 --> 00:55:51.260
What you doing?

1002
00:55:52.218 --> 00:55:55.787
Getting ready for a date.
with Mr. Rollins.

1003
00:55:55.874 --> 00:55:57.354
He's so nice.

1004
00:55:57.441 --> 00:55:59.094
He really is. but I
don't know what to wear.

1005
00:55:59.138 --> 00:56:01.358
I don't know if it's going
to be inside or outside.

1006
00:56:02.446 --> 00:56:04.230
Better to always be prepared.

1007
00:56:04.273 --> 00:56:05.884
-Boots?
-Check.

1008
00:56:05.927 --> 00:56:08.147
-Wool socks?
-Borrowed Mom's.

1009
00:56:08.234 --> 00:56:10.236
Scarf. gloves?

1010
00:56:10.279 --> 00:56:11.890
Earmuffs?

1011
00:56:13.761 --> 00:56:15.197
Hang on.

1012
00:56:23.554 --> 00:56:25.164
I was going to wait
for Christmas morning.

1013
00:56:25.251 --> 00:56:26.818
but this seems like
the perfect moment.

1014
00:56:26.905 --> 00:56:27.862
Are you sure?

1015
00:56:34.129 --> 00:56:36.262
I love them. thank you.

1016
00:56:37.306 --> 00:56:39.221
Merry Christmas Eve-eve.

1017
00:56:39.308 --> 00:56:41.398
Merry Christmas Eve-eve. Janey.

1018
00:56:41.485 --> 00:56:42.703
Good luck on your date.

1019
00:56:43.661 --> 00:56:44.531
Thank you.

1020
00:57:02.027 --> 00:57:03.768
You look beautiful.

1021
00:57:04.769 --> 00:57:05.770
Thank you.

1022
00:57:08.425 --> 00:57:11.210
So I'm taking you to the
newest restaurant in town.

1023
00:57:11.297 --> 00:57:12.429
Opening night.

1024
00:57:12.472 --> 00:57:14.648
Ooh. I love a premier.

1025
00:57:23.222 --> 00:57:25.616
Welcome to Casa Rollins.

1026
00:57:27.618 --> 00:57:29.097
Oh hi. darling.

1027
00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:32.971
This is the house
that you grew up in?

1028
00:57:33.014 --> 00:57:34.842
Yeah. it is.

1029
00:57:34.886 --> 00:57:37.018
I'm house sitting while
my parents are away.

1030
00:57:37.105 --> 00:57:38.672
Casey. this place is.

1031
00:57:38.716 --> 00:57:39.673
Christmasy?

1032
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.631
I love it.

1033
00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:44.635
Dahlia and I are spending
Christmas this year

1034
00:57:44.722 --> 00:57:46.288
with my parents in Florida. so.

1035
00:57:46.332 --> 00:57:48.203
you really get into decorating

1036
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:51.206
before it's all white sand
instead of white snow.

1037
00:57:51.293 --> 00:57:54.122
Oh. I didn't know
that you were leaving.

1038
00:57:54.209 --> 00:57:55.297
Tomorrow night.

1039
00:57:55.384 --> 00:57:56.560
After the play.

1040
00:57:56.647 --> 00:58:00.041
Booked a Christmas Eve
red-eye flight months ago.

1041
00:58:00.128 --> 00:58:03.175
So I was thinking. I would
bump up Christmas dinner

1042
00:58:03.218 --> 00:58:04.785
a couple of nights.

1043
00:58:09.964 --> 00:58:12.663
<i>♪ Two hearts by the fire</i>

1044
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:14.882
<i>♪ One bottle of wine ♪</i>

1045
00:58:14.926 --> 00:58:19.713
<i>♪ Three hours doesn't
feel like enough ♪</i>

1046
00:58:19.757 --> 00:58:21.889
You made my favorite yams?

1047
00:58:22.847 --> 00:58:26.241
My mom walked me
through it over the phone.

1048
00:58:26.285 --> 00:58:28.330
Even added the
mini marshmallows.

1049
00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:32.639
This is. I don't
know what to say.

1050
00:58:34.119 --> 00:58:37.470
To old friends
and new traditions.

1051
00:58:41.692 --> 00:58:44.216
That turkey was perfect.

1052
00:58:44.259 --> 00:58:45.696
I'm glad you liked it.

1053
00:58:46.566 --> 00:58:48.176
Room for dessert?

1054
00:58:48.263 --> 00:58:49.569
Full disclosure...

1055
00:58:49.656 --> 00:58:51.702
I sort of hired
a pastry chef.

1056
00:58:53.921 --> 00:58:56.271
North Pole pie.

1057
00:58:56.358 --> 00:58:58.230
Only my dad knew how to make it.

1058
00:58:59.144 --> 00:59:00.754
I talked to your mom.

1059
00:59:00.841 --> 00:59:03.844
Her and Janey were
practicing to surprise you.

1060
00:59:04.845 --> 00:59:06.238
I lucked out.

1061
00:59:24.822 --> 00:59:27.738
How are you feeling
about the show tomorrow?

1062
00:59:28.869 --> 00:59:30.131
Pretty good. thanks.

1063
00:59:30.218 --> 00:59:33.091
We just have to sync up
Jack's music with the finale.

1064
00:59:33.178 --> 00:59:34.962
Jack's music?

1065
00:59:35.049 --> 00:59:37.748
Yeah. he composed
an original score.

1066
00:59:37.835 --> 00:59:39.097
He's really come
out of his shell.

1067
00:59:39.184 --> 00:59:40.794
it's amazing to watch
and I was hoping

1068
00:59:40.838 --> 00:59:42.274
that you could help him
with the sound board

1069
00:59:42.361 --> 00:59:43.492
and maybe the lights.

1070
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.756
Of course. I'd
love to help out.

1071
00:59:46.626 --> 00:59:48.672
You know. I almost
wish that I could just

1072
00:59:48.759 --> 00:59:50.499
stay on as drama teacher

1073
00:59:50.543 --> 00:59:52.719
and leave Hollywood
behind for a bit.

1074
00:59:54.025 --> 00:59:55.983
I don't imagine this
is how you pictured

1075
00:59:56.027 --> 00:59:57.898
your life right about now.

1076
00:59:57.985 --> 00:59:59.117
No.

1077
01:00:00.727 --> 01:00:02.903
But there's no other place
I'd rather be.

1078
01:00:10.215 --> 01:00:12.870
Okay. I have a confession.

1079
01:00:12.957 --> 01:00:14.828
I said my dad made us
watch all your games.

1080
01:00:14.915 --> 01:00:19.616
but it was really just because
I had the biggest crush on you.
