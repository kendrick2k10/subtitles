{\an8}<i>You might not know</i>

4
00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.833
{\an8}<i>how this road became</i>
<i>so globally well known.</i>

5
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:48.208
<i>It's thanks to the American soldiers.</i>

6
00:00:49.083 --> 00:00:52.416
<i>It all started in 1966.</i>

7
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.541
<i>The first go-go bar opened here.</i>

8
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.875
<i>I was born in that year.</i>

9
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:03.166
<i>Right now. I'm the boss here.</i>

10
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.333
<i>Despite being</i>
<i>just a low-rank police officer.</i>

11
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:14.333
<i>no matter where I go. people respect me.</i>

12
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.458
<i>No one was bigger than me on this road.</i>

13
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:00.166
<i>Well.</i>

14
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.125
<i>Mr. Simon is actually the boss.</i>

15
00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:06.750
<i>He's the real boss here.</i>

16
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:10.416
Ja-Chai!

17
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.125
Ja-Chai! Please help me!

18
00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:15.125
Leave me out of this! Get off!

19
00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:17.083
Help me! Simon is going to kill me!

20
00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:19.333
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- He'll kill me!

21
00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:22.125
- Hands off me!
- Ja-Chai. please!

22
00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.083
Please! Ja-Chai!

23
00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:29.583
Boss. please listen to me.

24
00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:31.958
<i>He owns hundreds of businesses.</i>

25
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:34.125
<i>both underground and above-ground.</i>

26
00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:36.875
<i>He can do whatever he pleases.</i>

27
00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:42.791
Now. listen carefully.

28
00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:44.708
Why did you do me dirty like that? Huh?

29
00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.625
Why?

30
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.583
Do you remember
what the money I gave you was for?

31
00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:54.625
To start a new life!

32
00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.333
Not gambling and losing it all. asshole!

33
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.166
Chai! You're a cop!
Chai! You're a cop! Chai!

34
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:13.750
Hey. Ja-Chai! Where are you going?

35
00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:16.416
Wait a sec. I've got
something to talk to you about.

36
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.250
<i>This is where it all started.</i>

37
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.416
<i>Last night. I went to Mr. Simon's club.</i>

38
00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:48.166
Hey. Ja-Chai!

39
00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:04.458
Hey. come on. One more time.

40
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:06.375
Here's a tip for you.

41
00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:08.166
Fucking hell.

42
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.458
You can't just leave like that.
Give me another round!

43
00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:13.250
<i>Remember this gun.</i>

44
00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:17.375
<i>From this point on.</i>
<i>this was where it all branched out.</i>

45
00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:18.750
I need 500.000.

46
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.333
- Don't gamble if this isn't your day.
- No! I have to.

47
00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:28.333
I just lost my daughter's treatment fee.
I need to get it back.

48
00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:31.833
I'll definitely take this back. Trust me.

49
00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:34.041
Take care of it.

50
00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:35.333
Five hundred thousand?

51
00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:39.125
For this old thing.
I can give you 100.000 at most.

52
00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:45.958
<i>Mr. Simon is under</i>
<i>someone else's oversight.</i>

53
00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:47.750
<i>his stepdad.</i>

54
00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:49.125
<i>His name is Nicholas.</i>

55
00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:52.875
<i>He's on his deathbed.</i>

56
00:04:56.083 --> 00:05:00.125
<i>Mr. Simon now runs all the businesses.</i>

57
00:05:39.458 --> 00:05:40.791
May I take your order?

58
00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:42.916
What's your bestseller?

59
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.166
Well. that'd be the Neapolitan.

60
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.666
How about a Hawaiian?

61
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.666
Yes. we have that.

62
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.208
<i>Great. One Hawaiian pizza. please.</i>

63
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.708
One Hawaiian pizza.

64
00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:57.375
Any drinks?

65
00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:00.333
What are you drinking right now?

66
00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:07.000
Lemon tea.

67
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.500
Here's your order.

68
00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:18.208
Right.

69
00:06:18.916 --> 00:06:19.916
Thanks.

70
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:23.208
I'll get you the change.

71
00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:24.708
No need.

72
00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:35.541
This is good. You made this yourself?

73
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:38.166
My husband did.

74
00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:41.416
Your husband…

75
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:44.583
is such a good cook.

76
00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:46.208
Though.

77
00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:49.125
I made this lemon tea.

78
00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:50.458
This?

79
00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:55.541
What's that?

80
00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:56.833
This?

81
00:06:57.541 --> 00:07:00.083
It's a gift for a friend.

82
00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:01.541
A gift?

83
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.750
Is it an antique? Does it shoot?

84
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:12.166
Have you pulled its trigger?

85
00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:15.583
Maybe to kill someone or something?

86
00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:22.500
Killing people?
I don't have to kill anyone anymore.

87
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.083
I'm Simon.

88
00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.083
Nice to meet you. Mr. Simon.

89
00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:36.333
See you.

90
00:07:36.416 --> 00:07:37.583
Of course.

91
00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:50.958
Fah?

92
00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:56.750
Are you Fah?

93
00:07:59.958 --> 00:08:01.000
I'm Thod.

94
00:08:03.041 --> 00:08:06.333
I'm Thod. Singh's brother.

95
00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:10.666
Thod?

96
00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:13.083
Yes.

97
00:08:13.166 --> 00:08:14.208
Is Singh here?

98
00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:15.875
Yes.

99
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.458
Why are you here?

100
00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.500
Is Singh here?

101
00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:24.541
Singh! Singh!

102
00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:27.625
Singh!

103
00:08:47.916 --> 00:08:49.708
Did you break out of prison?

104
00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:12.666
What?

105
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.750
Singh!

106
00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:16.208
Why do you think I shouldn't talk to him?

107
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.750
I took care of him since childhood!

108
00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:20.875
You have two weeks.

109
00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:23.875
No more. no less.

110
00:09:23.958 --> 00:09:26.333
Learn how to make pizzas
and put your ass to work.

111
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:38.291
<i>Thod got out of jail and helped</i>
<i>his brother run his pizza restaurant.</i>

112
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.791
<i>This is around the same time</i>
<i>Mr. Simon came to me with the gun.</i>

113
00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:45.750
<i>These stories weren't going to blend.</i>

114
00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:50.125
<i>but ultimately. they did.</i>

115
00:09:51.166 --> 00:09:52.666
<i>That's life.</i>

116
00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:55.500
<i>Something unexpected</i>

117
00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:58.583
<i>can change your fate forever.</i>

118
00:10:07.666 --> 00:10:12.458
Ja-Chai. just let me know
if you need credit.

119
00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:17.125
Really?

120
00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:24.500
Hey. Ja-Chai.

121
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:27.541
You know that at Lion Star.

122
00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:31.291
we're extremely profitable.

123
00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:35.875
But do you know where our money goes?

124
00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:38.666
I need to send it to Bangkok.

125
00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:42.833
to have it turned into gold
before it's shipped back to me.

126
00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:46.833
However. things went wrong
the last few weeks.

127
00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:49.000
Ja-Chai.

128
00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:53.166
Wait. Who is this lady to you?

129
00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:56.333
- My wife.
- Your wife?

130
00:10:56.416 --> 00:10:57.375
Yes.

131
00:10:57.458 --> 00:10:59.833
The same person as on the movie poster?

132
00:10:59.916 --> 00:11:01.416
- Yes.
- Seriously?

133
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.875
- She's your wife?
- She is.

134
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:12.291
Oh wow! She is a movie star?

135
00:11:14.291 --> 00:11:15.708
How amazing.

136
00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:18.500
- Mr. Simon.
- What a man!

137
00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:20.000
let's continue your gold story.

138
00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:21.666
Where is your wife now?

139
00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:23.583
She passed away.

140
00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:24.750
She did?

141
00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:26.916
- Many years ago.
- Really?

142
00:11:27.416 --> 00:11:28.791
What a shame.

143
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:32.083
No wonder I've never seen you with anyone.

144
00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:34.416
Mr. Simon. I…

145
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.583
I don't think I can help you

146
00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:42.250
because I'll retire soon
and live off of my pension.

147
00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:43.625
Ja-Chai!

148
00:11:43.708 --> 00:11:46.000
Just do this for me

149
00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:51.458
and you won't ever need your pension.

150
00:11:58.791 --> 00:12:05.291
Ja-Chai. I've cleared everything for you.

151
00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:07.458
You don't need to do a thing.

152
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:13.125
Walk in. show the document.
and my people will do the rest.

153
00:12:13.208 --> 00:12:15.583
They'll hand you the gold.

154
00:12:15.666 --> 00:12:18.583
You just put it in a car

155
00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:20.750
and drive back to me.

156
00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:25.833
Just like that? Put it in the car

157
00:12:27.416 --> 00:12:30.833
- and bring it back to you?
- The gold in a car.

158
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.375
drive back to me. That's it.

159
00:12:36.166 --> 00:12:39.833
So. why me?
You have many men that could do that.

160
00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:54.750
<i>In 1998.</i>

161
00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:56.541
<i>a 16-year-old girl</i>

162
00:12:56.625 --> 00:12:59.833
<i>went on a trip with her family</i>
<i>from a fishing village near Pattaya.</i>

163
00:13:00.583 --> 00:13:03.333
<i>They planned on having</i>
<i>a beautiful holiday in Pattaya.</i>

164
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.666
<i>On their journey.</i>

165
00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:08.416
<i>a tragic event happened.</i>

166
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.125
<i>It was a car accident.</i>

167
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.375
<i>Her dad. mom. and little brother died.</i>

168
00:13:14.083 --> 00:13:17.375
<i>The girl survived</i>
<i>but only after seven surgeries.</i>

169
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.125
<i>That girl is Gee.</i>

170
00:13:22.916 --> 00:13:24.333
Hey. Gee!

171
00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:28.041
- Where's the guy?
- There.

172
00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:33.791
Is he coming up or what?

173
00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:36.166
Not anytime soon.

174
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.250
- What does that mean?
- Well. he only talks to me.

175
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.583
Then we don't need this conversation.

176
00:13:42.666 --> 00:13:45.583
You can talk to me

177
00:13:45.666 --> 00:13:47.125
and I'll pass it on to him.

178
00:13:48.416 --> 00:13:52.750
Why would I come all the way here
to talk to you?

179
00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:55.625
Fine!

180
00:13:58.958 --> 00:13:59.916
Hey!

181
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:04.333
What's next? Are we going to talk?

182
00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:09.000
Fine. it's a no.

183
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.166
Start the engine!

184
00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.458
Ms. Gee.

185
00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:22.416
Hok's coming out.

186
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.708
There's Hok. Hok!

187
00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:29.500
This is Ms. Gee. She's big around here.

188
00:14:37.208 --> 00:14:39.666
I heard you are a good fortune-teller.

189
00:14:42.708 --> 00:14:45.125
See you tomorrow at Na Kluea Market.

190
00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:48.625
<i>The first thing Gee did</i>
<i>after getting out of the hospital</i>

191
00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:52.500
<i>was to visit a fortune-teller</i>
<i>to learn the craft.</i>

192
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.208
<i>A few years later.</i>

193
00:14:55.291 --> 00:14:58.625
<i>she became the most</i>
<i>mysterious fortune-teller in Pattaya.</i>

194
00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.208
<i>She knows a large number of people</i>

195
00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:02.750
<i>and. of course.</i>

196
00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:05.125
<i>her insight</i>

197
00:15:06.791 --> 00:15:08.583
<i>is just as vast.</i>

198
00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:21.583
Okay. let's go.

199
00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:25.000
I'm just a fortune-teller.

200
00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:27.708
You don't have to believe me.

201
00:15:28.583 --> 00:15:30.166
Many people don't.

202
00:15:32.708 --> 00:15:34.333
Six months ago.

203
00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:36.458
you were transporting Simon's gold

204
00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:37.875
from Bangkok to Pattaya.

205
00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:42.125
On your way. at Khao Chi Chan.

206
00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:44.500
you were stopped
by the police and customs.

207
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.958
Police! Do not resist!

208
00:15:56.458 --> 00:15:59.083
Do not resist! Get out of the car!

209
00:15:59.166 --> 00:16:02.250
This is the police. Do not resist!

210
00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:04.166
<i>Do not resist!</i>

211
00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:12.458
I will spare your life.

212
00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:17.625
but I can't let you get away like this.

213
00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:18.833
Do you understand?

214
00:16:20.208 --> 00:16:22.416
I can't let you live

215
00:16:23.125 --> 00:16:25.875
without understanding the consequences.

216
00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:34.875
Mah? I'm begging you.

217
00:16:34.958 --> 00:16:38.500
No. Mah. Please.

218
00:16:39.541 --> 00:16:41.708
Mah. please.

219
00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:55.166
To get the gold.
Simon needs to do two things.

220
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.583
First. withdraw the gold as an exhibit.

221
00:16:58.666 --> 00:17:01.875
This is so that customs is not involved.

222
00:17:01.958 --> 00:17:05.083
Secondly. he needs
an obedient police officer

223
00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:08.041
to help transport the gold
and bring it to Pattaya.

224
00:17:12.416 --> 00:17:13.916
Hey. Gee!

225
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.291
I got some good stuff.
Want to eat together?

226
00:17:17.208 --> 00:17:18.083
But…

227
00:17:19.125 --> 00:17:20.708
this isn't a one-man job.

228
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:22.458
Do you have a team?

229
00:17:24.916 --> 00:17:28.166
Have you ever heard of Thod?

230
00:17:53.166 --> 00:17:54.166
Hey!

231
00:18:01.125 --> 00:18:04.208
What the fuck?! Who are you?

232
00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:05.625
Why did you shoot him?

233
00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:08.083
Fuck you!

234
00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:09.625
Let's play together.

235
00:18:09.708 --> 00:18:11.750
- No. fuck off!
- Let's go!

236
00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:13.166
Fuck you!

237
00:18:14.916 --> 00:18:16.125
Motherfucker!

238
00:18:22.375 --> 00:18:23.250
Focus!

239
00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:32.083
Help me!

240
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.750
Whoo!

241
00:18:40.708 --> 00:18:42.125
Last ball!

242
00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:43.458
Who are you?

243
00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:57.125
Please. don't kill me.

244
00:18:57.791 --> 00:18:59.125
I… I… surrender.

245
00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:00.791
I'm scared.

246
00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:02.458
I have a family.

247
00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:07.250
I promise I won't tell the police.
I didn't see anything.

248
00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:10.166
Please! I'll keep my mouth shut.

249
00:20:03.625 --> 00:20:06.166
- Welcome!
- Welcome.

250
00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:07.583
<i>For this reason.</i>

251
00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:09.750
<i>Thod began helping his brother.</i>

252
00:20:11.375 --> 00:20:13.625
<i>but he didn't just sell pizzas.</i>

253
00:20:14.708 --> 00:20:16.916
<i>He distributed drugs on the side.</i>

254
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.375
<i>That caused the pizza restaurant to grow.</i>

255
00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:23.583
One Neapolitan pizza. please.

256
00:20:23.666 --> 00:20:25.291
And the special salt. please.

257
00:20:33.458 --> 00:20:35.208
- Who is it for?
- Alan.

258
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.791
Thank you. I hope to see you again.

259
00:20:46.916 --> 00:20:49.583
Thank you. Welcome. Welcome.

260
00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:56.125
Singh. are you going to deliver that?

261
00:20:56.208 --> 00:20:59.000
Oh! Two to go and a drink.

262
00:21:58.208 --> 00:21:59.291
You're very sneaky. aren't you?

263
00:22:01.666 --> 00:22:02.833
What are you talking about?

264
00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:10.250
Since you came back.
we've had many more customers.

265
00:22:12.291 --> 00:22:14.125
Is it because of that special salt?

266
00:22:24.458 --> 00:22:26.000
Don't worry.

267
00:22:27.166 --> 00:22:28.916
I'll keep it a secret for you.

268
00:22:33.708 --> 00:22:35.541
Fah. don't do this.

269
00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:37.833
Don't do this.

270
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:50.666
<i>Hok wished to exact revenge</i>
<i>on Simon for gouging his eye out.</i>

271
00:22:51.208 --> 00:22:53.416
<i>He decided to work with Gee.</i>

272
00:22:54.333 --> 00:22:55.708
<i>But he knew</i>

273
00:22:55.791 --> 00:22:59.541
<i>that he needed someone</i>
<i>to deal with all of this.</i>

274
00:23:00.708 --> 00:23:02.583
Have you been playing tennis lately?

275
00:23:06.083 --> 00:23:07.875
You believe that story too?

276
00:23:08.875 --> 00:23:09.916
I don't care.

277
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.625
That's made up.

278
00:23:15.541 --> 00:23:16.833
A rumor. at best.

279
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.083
What happened to your eye?

280
00:23:36.875 --> 00:23:38.666
Why do you need to know?

281
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.041
Does it make you uncomfortable?

282
00:23:43.458 --> 00:23:44.416
The thing is.

283
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.208
if we do this together.

284
00:23:48.041 --> 00:23:50.416
you can quit dealing drugs
from this pizza place.

285
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.125
Yes. as simple as that.

286
00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:57.291
That's because. from now on.

287
00:23:59.083 --> 00:24:01.583
you're not a lowlife drug dealer anymore.

288
00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:07.166
You're recruiting me
while calling me a lowlife?

289
00:24:07.916 --> 00:24:11.000
No. you're worse.

290
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.583
You're going to ruin everything
your brother has built.

291
00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:18.250
Do you understand?

292
00:25:06.791 --> 00:25:07.916
What?

293
00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:11.125
Can you drink with me?

294
00:25:12.458 --> 00:25:16.500
- You've had too much drink. Stop.
- I only had one drink.

295
00:25:17.958 --> 00:25:19.208
Thod.

296
00:25:22.166 --> 00:25:24.375
Why can't you be my drinking friend?

297
00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:28.125
Fah. stop messing with me.

298
00:25:29.166 --> 00:25:31.291
I'm not. I'm inviting you to drink.

299
00:25:31.791 --> 00:25:33.375
You're drunk. Go home.

300
00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:39.708
All my life.

301
00:25:42.083 --> 00:25:44.916
no one ever bats an eye for me.

302
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.708
You act like this and expect people
to take you seriously?

303
00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:50.208
- Like this?
- Yeah.

304
00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:53.000
Like this?

305
00:25:57.416 --> 00:25:58.958
Fuck you. Fucking do it!

306
00:25:59.916 --> 00:26:01.416
‪Damn it!

307
00:26:02.416 --> 00:26:03.541
- Motherfucker!
- Brother…

308
00:26:03.625 --> 00:26:04.791
‪I…

309
00:26:05.833 --> 00:26:06.916
Fuck you!

310
00:26:16.083 --> 00:26:17.333
Fah. what happened?

311
00:26:17.916 --> 00:26:20.166
Why don't you ask your brother?

312
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.250
Thod?

313
00:26:22.458 --> 00:26:24.000
What were you thinking?

314
00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:25.833
Everything's fine. I'm a bit drunk.

315
00:26:25.916 --> 00:26:27.916
A bit drunk?

316
00:26:29.041 --> 00:26:32.750
- Singh. he was going to rape me!
- Thod!

317
00:26:32.833 --> 00:26:34.875
Do you know what you've done?

318
00:26:34.958 --> 00:26:36.291
What did I do?

319
00:26:36.375 --> 00:26:37.666
Ask your wife.

320
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.708
Ask me?

321
00:26:42.291 --> 00:26:43.541
Do you know

322
00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:47.000
that your brother has been dealing drugs
from our pizza place?

323
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.375
Thod. is this true?

324
00:26:54.166 --> 00:26:56.375
You ruined your life.

325
00:26:56.458 --> 00:26:58.083
and now you're going to ruin ours?

326
00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:00.791
I bring more customers to your business.

327
00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:03.625
You call that ruining? You're nonsensical.

328
00:27:03.708 --> 00:27:05.333
Nonsensical. you say?

329
00:27:07.416 --> 00:27:09.125
Nonsensical?

330
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.583
Then what the fuck are these?

331
00:27:11.666 --> 00:27:13.541
What are these. huh?

332
00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:15.416
Hey. why?

333
00:27:26.125 --> 00:27:27.208
Fuck off!

334
00:27:27.291 --> 00:27:28.625
Fucking Thod!

335
00:27:30.416 --> 00:27:32.666
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police!

336
00:27:35.208 --> 00:27:36.875
You can't do this.

337
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:42.458
You're pointing your gun at me now?

338
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.791
Shoot me.

339
00:27:44.875 --> 00:27:46.000
Do it!

340
00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:47.583
Fucking do it.

341
00:27:48.625 --> 00:27:50.500
You can have an honest job.
but you won't take it.

342
00:27:50.583 --> 00:27:52.375
What the fuck are you even doing?

343
00:27:52.458 --> 00:27:54.541
What do you want me to do?

344
00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:55.875
What do you want me to do?

345
00:27:55.958 --> 00:27:58.750
Killing and dealing drugs.
this is all I'm good for!

346
00:28:00.041 --> 00:28:01.041
Leave.

347
00:28:02.083 --> 00:28:05.708
Get the fuck out
and never step foot here again.

348
00:28:12.166 --> 00:28:13.791
Fuck's sake!

349
00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:31.291
Get lost. asshole!

350
00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:05.791
What's in the bag?

351
00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:09.625
I said. "What's in the bag?"

352
00:29:10.291 --> 00:29:11.458
Nothing.

353
00:29:11.958 --> 00:29:13.166
Let me see it.

354
00:29:49.166 --> 00:29:50.666
<i>Hok didn't succeed.</i>

355
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:52.291
<i>so Gee had to get to work.</i>

356
00:29:52.375 --> 00:29:54.000
<i>She arranged a dinner.</i>

357
00:29:54.833 --> 00:29:57.666
<i>No. a murder.</i>

358
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.708
Papa Nicholas.

359
00:30:03.916 --> 00:30:05.083
Hey. Papa.

360
00:30:05.166 --> 00:30:06.166
He's gone.

361
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.250
<i>Dad!</i>

362
00:30:09.166 --> 00:30:11.333
But he deserved to die.

363
00:30:12.166 --> 00:30:13.875
He's a bad man.

364
00:30:14.791 --> 00:30:16.750
A devil.

365
00:30:16.833 --> 00:30:18.125
<i>Without him.</i>

366
00:30:19.458 --> 00:30:22.750
I would've run Lion Star a long time ago!

367
00:30:22.833 --> 00:30:26.583
But this asshole never once in his life

368
00:30:26.666 --> 00:30:28.708
gave me a chance to take over.

369
00:30:28.791 --> 00:30:31.875
He just delayed
and delayed it until death!

370
00:30:31.958 --> 00:30:33.375
For fucking God knows what.

371
00:30:39.583 --> 00:30:43.416
He raised me as if I were his son.

372
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:51.875
I remember when I was a lowlife
on the street.

373
00:30:53.333 --> 00:30:56.541
The first time I got stabbed
and was injured badly.

374
00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:58.416
Papa…

375
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:03.166
stayed at my bedside at the hospital.

376
00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:09.583
All day and night.

377
00:31:25.625 --> 00:31:27.291
And I was the one who killed him!

378
00:31:29.583 --> 00:31:31.125
I killed him!

379
00:31:31.208 --> 00:31:34.333
I killed him at the hospital.
I took the pillow.

380
00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:37.833
<i>suffocated him with it…</i>

381
00:31:40.208 --> 00:31:41.375
until he died.

382
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.791
I kept calling him Papa.

383
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:46.583
Papa.

384
00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:48.125
Papa!

385
00:31:48.208 --> 00:31:50.541
Papa!

386
00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:52.041
Papa!

387
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.458
He would never have a chance

388
00:31:57.541 --> 00:32:00.458
to hear my voice
because he's already dead.

389
00:32:01.708 --> 00:32:04.666
He'll never hear my voice again.

390
00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:18.833
Gee.

391
00:32:28.958 --> 00:32:31.666
What happened to your face?

392
00:32:32.458 --> 00:32:33.750
I walked into the door.

393
00:32:37.791 --> 00:32:39.750
The pizza girl.

394
00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:42.833
Mr. Simon.

395
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.291
You know each other?

396
00:32:47.875 --> 00:32:49.833
The Angel Pizza girl.

397
00:32:50.583 --> 00:32:52.000
Of course. I know her.

398
00:32:52.083 --> 00:32:53.541
We know each other.

399
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.666
<i>It's done. Let's begin.</i>

400
00:33:31.916 --> 00:33:33.875
Angel Pizza. How can I help?

401
00:33:33.958 --> 00:33:38.125
Hello. I'd like to order a pizza.

402
00:33:38.208 --> 00:33:40.458
The Napoleon… Neapolitan pizza thing.

403
00:33:40.541 --> 00:33:41.708
I want one.

404
00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:43.583
And deliver to where?

405
00:33:43.666 --> 00:33:46.958
VIP room 1 at Lion Star.

406
00:33:47.041 --> 00:33:47.875
That's it.

407
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.625
One martini. please.

408
00:34:30.375 --> 00:34:34.166
I'm not sure. but that police officer.

409
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:38.166
he goes in and out of the casino
regularly. Can you find him?

410
00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:48.791
Do you have a lighter?

411
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.125
<i>By this time.</i>

412
00:34:53.208 --> 00:34:55.375
- Thank you.
- <i>I didn't realize</i>

413
00:34:55.458 --> 00:34:57.916
<i>that I was one of the chess pieces</i>
<i>in Gee's plan.</i>

414
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.541
Are you a regular here?

415
00:34:59.625 --> 00:35:01.208
<i>It's a shame.</i>

416
00:35:01.916 --> 00:35:04.291
- Yes.
- <i>but I had to do it</i>

417
00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:05.875
<i>to get the treatment money for my kid.</i>

418
00:35:08.875 --> 00:35:10.125
My name is Gee.

419
00:35:12.833 --> 00:35:14.166
How is your luck today?

420
00:36:20.875 --> 00:36:23.166
What the fuck are you doing?
Are you crazy?

421
00:36:35.666 --> 00:36:38.500
Good evening. It's Angel Pizza.

422
00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.416
What's that?

423
00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:43.708
- Fuck you!
- What the hell?!

424
00:36:45.583 --> 00:36:47.250
Do you fucking know who I am?

425
00:36:47.333 --> 00:36:49.208
- Fah?
- Singh.

426
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:50.375
You two know each other?

427
00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:52.750
- That's my wife!
- Get the fuck out!

428
00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:56.208
Wait. Did you mean him or me?
Who did you talk to?

429
00:36:56.791 --> 00:36:58.083
Fuck you!

430
00:37:03.333 --> 00:37:04.875
Motherfucker!

431
00:37:26.208 --> 00:37:27.708
The gun!

432
00:37:27.791 --> 00:37:28.666
The gun!

433
00:37:31.541 --> 00:37:34.166
Fah! Hand me the gun! Hand me the gun!

434
00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:43.833
<i>Nicholas. Simon's stepdad.</i>
<i>used to tell me this.</i>

435
00:37:44.833 --> 00:37:46.500
<i>He said.</i>

436
00:37:46.583 --> 00:37:48.375
<i>"Don't kill because of love.</i>

437
00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:50.791
<i>Don't kill because of anger.</i>

438
00:37:51.291 --> 00:37:53.125
<i>Don't kill because of fear.</i>

439
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.791
<i>Killing…</i>

440
00:37:56.791 --> 00:37:58.541
<i>is purely for benefits."</i>

441
00:38:00.083 --> 00:38:01.166
<i>Therefore.</i>

442
00:38:02.166 --> 00:38:05.500
<i>Simon made a mistake.</i>

443
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.916
<i>That complicated things.</i>

444
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.958
Singh!

445
00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:16.583
<i>The problem worsened every day.</i>

446
00:41:18.833 --> 00:41:21.541
She started
wrapping everything in plastic.

447
00:41:22.625 --> 00:41:24.000
The table.

448
00:41:24.083 --> 00:41:25.500
chairs.

449
00:41:26.208 --> 00:41:27.833
TV. fridge…

450
00:41:28.791 --> 00:41:30.750
You need to take your medicine!

451
00:41:35.083 --> 00:41:38.500
Let me in! You need your medicine!

452
00:41:38.583 --> 00:41:40.041
Please let me in.

453
00:41:40.125 --> 00:41:43.833
…glasses. and dining ware.

454
00:41:47.208 --> 00:41:52.083
There was nothing that was left unwrapped.

455
00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:56.250
Leave me alone. I want to be alone!

456
00:41:56.333 --> 00:41:57.750
That's what happens
when you don't take your meds.

457
00:41:57.833 --> 00:41:58.791
‪Get out!

458
00:41:59.875 --> 00:42:02.000
- Where are they?
- Leave me!

459
00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:04.166
Get out!

460
00:42:16.541 --> 00:42:19.500
Thank you for the second drink.

461
00:42:20.166 --> 00:42:22.166
When I was 16.

462
00:42:23.416 --> 00:42:25.791
I lost my family too.

463
00:42:27.208 --> 00:42:28.375
Don't look at me like that.

464
00:42:28.958 --> 00:42:30.916
I don't have any secrets.

465
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.625
My job is to keep others' secrets.

466
00:42:36.916 --> 00:42:38.291
Go on with your story.

467
00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:40.375
And what happened

468
00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:43.125
to your daughter after that?

469
00:42:44.583 --> 00:42:46.208
I'll tell you next time.

470
00:43:12.375 --> 00:43:14.041
Open your fucking eyes!

471
00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:15.666
Does this look like a car accident?

472
00:43:16.416 --> 00:43:17.791
What do you think made these holes?

473
00:43:19.416 --> 00:43:22.083
- What are these holes?
- You need to ask the police.

474
00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:27.208
I'm only responsible
for issuing the autopsy report.

475
00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:31.083
I don't need to ask anyone else
because I have your shitty report here!

476
00:43:36.708 --> 00:43:40.000
Who? Who asked you to make this report?

477
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.166
If you have doubts
about the autopsy result.

478
00:43:48.666 --> 00:43:52.291
you can request a forensic evaluation.

479
00:43:56.583 --> 00:43:58.333
That's all I can do to help.

480
00:44:16.958 --> 00:44:21.041
BANG LAMUNG HOSPITAL

481
00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:47.875
What if I know who killed your brother?
What do you say?

482
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:52.000
What did you just say?

483
00:45:07.875 --> 00:45:09.083
<i>Now.</i>

484
00:45:09.708 --> 00:45:11.916
<i>everyone Gee wants</i>

485
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.916
<i>has gotten in the same boat.</i>

486
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.416
<i>except me.</i>

487
00:45:18.708 --> 00:45:20.625
<i>an old policeman.</i>

488
00:45:21.125 --> 00:45:23.541
<i>an old. greedy policeman.</i>

489
00:45:24.916 --> 00:45:27.125
Draw one card from each group

490
00:45:27.958 --> 00:45:31.125
and put them in any order you wish.

491
00:45:35.458 --> 00:45:37.125
<i>If I jump in.</i>

492
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
<i>the plan will be complete.</i>

493
00:46:06.083 --> 00:46:07.791
- I want to know--
- Silence.

494
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:13.041
The answers are on the table.

495
00:46:18.333 --> 00:46:22.916
You are responsible for something valuable

496
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.625
or someone important. right?

497
00:46:32.416 --> 00:46:35.166
Are you going to begin your voyage soon?

498
00:46:36.791 --> 00:46:39.583
You are too accurate!

499
00:46:39.666 --> 00:46:41.375
That's what the cards say.

500
00:46:41.958 --> 00:46:43.375
Unbelievable.

501
00:46:52.125 --> 00:46:54.541
But you will face troubles
in this job of yours.

502
00:46:56.458 --> 00:46:57.541
Is there a solution?

503
00:46:58.833 --> 00:47:00.583
- Change your route.
- Change my route?

504
00:47:00.666 --> 00:47:02.416
- Change your route.
- How?

505
00:47:03.125 --> 00:47:04.333
How would I know?

506
00:47:06.666 --> 00:47:08.708
I don't even know where you are going.

507
00:47:14.583 --> 00:47:18.000
Your fate depends on you.

508
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:22.916
Change your route and you'll be safe.

509
00:47:54.708 --> 00:47:56.791
What are all these? Bombs?

510
00:47:58.208 --> 00:48:01.125
No idea. Probably beer.

511
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:44.416
I took this job of yours.

512
00:49:45.541 --> 00:49:46.583
Tell me the truth.

513
00:49:48.083 --> 00:49:49.458
Let's finish this first.

514
00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:53.083
I've been wondering

515
00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:57.500
why you want to take revenge.

516
00:49:58.583 --> 00:50:02.458
though you never cared
whether Singh lived or died.

517
00:50:04.541 --> 00:50:06.041
What are you talking about?

518
00:50:06.125 --> 00:50:10.375
I saw you pointing a gun at Singh's head.

519
00:50:13.083 --> 00:50:14.625
You can't do this.

520
00:50:17.583 --> 00:50:22.333
Pizza. pizza. Any pizza will do.

521
00:50:23.333 --> 00:50:24.333
Hok.

522
00:50:26.958 --> 00:50:29.708
That's not yours or anyone's business.

523
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.416
Chonburi. so what?

524
00:50:38.875 --> 00:50:41.041
Do you know the Shark Gang?

525
00:50:42.333 --> 00:50:47.041
The Shark Gang is a criminal gang
formed by fishermen.

526
00:50:47.125 --> 00:50:50.166
Mah. I know the Shark Gang.

527
00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:52.625
I fucking know who they are.

528
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.333
Ja-Chai. what about this Shark Gang?

529
00:50:58.041 --> 00:51:01.291
My informant told me they gathered

530
00:51:01.375 --> 00:51:04.041
at Samaesarn a few hours ago.

531
00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:07.041
armed to the teeth.

532
00:51:07.125 --> 00:51:09.291
Shit. What now?

533
00:51:11.083 --> 00:51:12.666
- Change our route.
- Change our route?

534
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:14.708
- Change our route.
- To what?

535
00:51:14.791 --> 00:51:15.791
- The bypass.
- The bypass?

536
00:51:15.875 --> 00:51:17.708
- The bypass.
- Bypassing Pattaya?

537
00:51:17.791 --> 00:51:19.500
- That's it.
- No! No!

538
00:51:19.583 --> 00:51:20.416
Then I'm out.

539
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.000
- You won't.
- I won't.

540
00:51:22.083 --> 00:51:23.458
- You won't go.
- I won't go.

541
00:51:23.541 --> 00:51:24.375
- Are you sure?
- I won't go.

542
00:51:24.458 --> 00:51:26.541
- You won't go.
- I won't go.

543
00:51:35.833 --> 00:51:38.833
If you were to pull the trigger that day.

544
00:51:39.916 --> 00:51:41.458
it wouldn't make any difference.

545
00:51:46.541 --> 00:51:50.541
Only I can kill him. no one else.

546
00:51:51.625 --> 00:51:53.083
That's my rule.

547
00:53:47.291 --> 00:53:49.541
I have a question.
Why did Singh have to die?

548
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.125
<i>This is one of our cards.</i>

549
00:54:04.083 --> 00:54:07.291
<i>Only we know how Thod's brother died.</i>

550
00:54:08.583 --> 00:54:10.750
<i>If the pizza place was still in business.</i>

551
00:54:10.833 --> 00:54:12.458
<i>Thod wouldn't have joined us.</i>

552
00:54:13.166 --> 00:54:15.791
<i>So. Singh had to go.</i>

553
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.625
DELIVERY ADDRESS
VIP 1 LION STAR ENTERTAINMENT BUILDING

554
00:54:47.208 --> 00:54:49.750
Am I also one of your cards?

555
00:54:55.875 --> 00:54:56.875
No.

556
00:54:58.791 --> 00:55:00.666
Stop fishing.

557
00:55:04.625 --> 00:55:06.166
Come with me.

558
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.708
The fuck you looking at? Get in the car.

559
00:56:31.916 --> 00:56:34.208
What are these men for?

560
00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:40.041
Get in.

561
00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:19.416
Ja-Chai. wake up.

562
00:57:21.166 --> 00:57:22.375
Wake up!

563
00:57:23.333 --> 00:57:24.958
I wasn't sleeping.

564
00:57:25.541 --> 00:57:27.083
You don't need to shout.

565
00:57:28.166 --> 00:57:31.250
We're nearly at the junction.
Changing route?

566
00:57:31.333 --> 00:57:33.750
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

567
00:57:39.416 --> 00:57:42.916
Why do you keep asking me questions?
You're not my fucking boss!

568
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.875
Be nice to me. please.

569
00:57:47.666 --> 00:57:49.666
I've been very nice to you.

570
00:57:50.958 --> 00:57:53.250
I would've blown your head off
if I was in my prime.

571
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:56.833
If not because of Mr. Simon.

572
00:57:56.916 --> 00:57:59.125
I would've done the same.

573
00:58:17.416 --> 00:58:18.583
Why are we stopping?

574
00:58:18.666 --> 00:58:21.791
I'm starving. I need to eat.

575
00:58:21.875 --> 00:58:25.583
- Why now?
- Fuck off.

576
00:58:25.666 --> 00:58:27.250
I could eat a horse!

577
00:59:05.791 --> 00:59:07.166
What the hell is wrong with you?

578
00:59:08.208 --> 00:59:09.750
Do you believe in destiny?

579
00:59:10.833 --> 00:59:12.750
This is destiny.

580
00:59:13.833 --> 00:59:17.000
This billboard. Do you see that woman?

581
00:59:17.666 --> 00:59:19.708
- Do you see her?
- Huh?

582
00:59:19.791 --> 00:59:22.916
- My wife played in this movie!
- What the fuck are you on about?

583
00:59:23.625 --> 00:59:27.916
That's my wife.
I haven't seen this movie in 30 years!

584
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.708
I need to watch it.

585
00:59:34.791 --> 00:59:36.083
I have to.

586
00:59:36.166 --> 00:59:38.125
- We'll move after I'm done.
- What the hell?!

587
00:59:38.208 --> 00:59:41.000
If you have a problem.
we'll settle it in Pattaya.

588
00:59:41.083 --> 00:59:42.875
- I'm out!
- Hey!

589
00:59:42.958 --> 00:59:45.041
Ja-Chai!

590
01:00:09.916 --> 01:00:11.708
May I take your order?

591
01:00:11.791 --> 01:00:13.791
Two dishes of rice with fried pork.

592
01:01:27.666 --> 01:01:29.125
I miss you so much.

593
01:01:55.916 --> 01:01:57.375
Something to drink?

594
01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:08.500
Or maybe milk?

595
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:11.791
Alcohol.

596
01:02:15.791 --> 01:02:17.125
How about a martini?

597
01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:20.041
Anything.

598
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:22.958
I'll take anything.

599
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.291
even poison.

600
01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:33.208
How old are you?

601
01:02:34.916 --> 01:02:36.625
Old enough to fall in love.

602
01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:30.833
- Why is it so slow?
- I'm hungry.

603
01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:38.500
- Well. you can stop by…
- Otherwise. you will die of hunger.

604
01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:43.791
Excuse me. Here's your drink.

605
01:03:44.291 --> 01:03:47.791
Ma'am. your drink.

606
01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:07.000
Hey. why does it taste fucking bitter?

607
01:04:07.583 --> 01:04:09.500
Is yours bitter too?

608
01:04:15.208 --> 01:04:17.041
Fuck!

609
01:04:18.291 --> 01:04:19.375
Hey!

610
01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:43.666
The shooting started. Are you afraid?

611
01:04:45.416 --> 01:04:48.958
I'm afraid of having to shoot you.

612
01:04:51.333 --> 01:04:52.833
Then don't.

613
01:04:53.375 --> 01:04:56.250
Goodbye. beauty.

614
01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:03.875
‪Go!

615
01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.500
Will you betray me?

616
01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:13.625
Huh?

617
01:05:15.166 --> 01:05:16.708
Betray you?

618
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:19.875
Cheers.

619
01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:24.500
I miss you.

620
01:05:27.041 --> 01:05:28.666
I miss you so much.

621
01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:45.041
That's my wife.

622
01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:04.166
Fucking hell.

623
01:07:13.416 --> 01:07:17.666
The total reward is 560 million baht.

624
01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:22.333
Today. I'll wire the money
to the accounts Gee gave me.

625
01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:28.916
After today.
we'll be no one to each other.

626
01:07:30.291 --> 01:07:32.125
Do not make contact.

627
01:07:35.416 --> 01:07:38.083
I wish you all luck.

628
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:53.250
Alright.

629
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:57.666
The first share is 50 million each.

630
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.958
I'll wire it to everyone's account.

631
01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:05.375
However. it must
not be touched for a year.

632
01:08:05.458 --> 01:08:06.291
Got it?

633
01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:09.458
Then. I'll wire you the rest.

634
01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:18.291
I'm sorry that after today.
we won't see each other again.

635
01:08:20.458 --> 01:08:24.750
I'll find you when you're needed.

636
01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:27.375
Good luck.

637
01:09:33.333 --> 01:09:36.416
This is the last number
that called my brother's pizza place.

638
01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:42.250
Thod. wait! It is a misunderstanding.

639
01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:45.250
Thod. are you mad?

640
01:09:45.333 --> 01:09:48.416
- This isn't what you think it is.
- Thod. listen.

641
01:09:49.541 --> 01:09:53.333
Singh died because of Simon and Fah.

642
01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:56.791
But that's your number!

643
01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:00.583
That was my plan. It wasn't his idea.

644
01:10:02.875 --> 01:10:04.708
I don't care whose plan it was.

645
01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:06.625
Tell me the truth!

646
01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:09.000
Thod.

647
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:11.916
Point your gun at me.

648
01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:17.333
I just needed you on my team.

649
01:10:17.416 --> 01:10:21.333
- I had no idea it'd turn out like this.
- I'll show you a video

650
01:10:21.416 --> 01:10:23.625
and you can think about this again.

651
01:10:23.708 --> 01:10:24.958
Okay?

652
01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:27.250
‪Okay.

653
01:10:28.208 --> 01:10:31.875
One. two. three.

654
01:11:23.791 --> 01:11:25.000
Bring the food.

655
01:12:05.125 --> 01:12:09.833
This videotape contains the movie
<i>Sugar Plan</i>.

656
01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:13.666
Do you know where I got it?

657
01:12:14.541 --> 01:12:21.208
I looked online and found it was on sale
at the Thai Film Archive.

658
01:12:21.291 --> 01:12:22.541
Do you know how much I paid?

659
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.916
Thirty baht.

660
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.833
It could've been free.

661
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:34.875
However. 30 kilograms of gold

662
01:12:35.708 --> 01:12:41.708
is worth 560 million baht.

663
01:12:49.166 --> 01:12:50.708
I don't think you realized it.

664
01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:58.625
If you hadn't stopped to watch this movie.

665
01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:02.666
the gold would've returned
to me in Pattaya.

666
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:08.416
I had to fucking lose 560 million baht

667
01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.625
for this ass movie!

668
01:13:10.708 --> 01:13:15.041
I had to fucking lose 560 million baht

669
01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:17.250
for this ass of a movie!

670
01:13:17.333 --> 01:13:21.291
Fucking eat this shit! Eat it!

671
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.708
I fucking said it.

672
01:13:27.958 --> 01:13:29.333
How do I…

673
01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.041
Can you eat it now?

674
01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.875
Can you? Fucking can you?

675
01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:44.000
Eat it!

676
01:13:46.416 --> 01:13:47.750
Great.

677
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:50.750
Chew it! How does it feel. huh?

678
01:13:50.833 --> 01:13:55.666
A 560-million-baht movie.
Does it taste good?

679
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:58.125
Keep eating!

680
01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:00.750
Good boy!

681
01:14:00.833 --> 01:14:04.500
Just like that. Keep eating.

682
01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:07.250
I didn't fucking tell you to stop.
Why did you stop!

683
01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:08.958
Keep eating!

684
01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:11.458
Just like that.

685
01:14:13.083 --> 01:14:15.750
Don't stop.

686
01:14:17.208 --> 01:14:18.333
Huh?

687
01:14:24.708 --> 01:14:27.291
Don't stop. Keep going!

688
01:14:27.375 --> 01:14:29.250
Eat more! Yes!

689
01:14:29.333 --> 01:14:31.583
Eat it!

690
01:14:37.375 --> 01:14:38.750
Mr. Simon.

691
01:14:44.291 --> 01:14:46.750
I'll find a way to get the gold back.

692
01:14:47.958 --> 01:14:51.541
Aside from that stupid golden gun.

693
01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:54.125
what gold can you even bring back?

694
01:14:55.458 --> 01:15:00.291
From now on. your only job

695
01:15:01.583 --> 01:15:06.791
is to be a lapdog under my command.

696
01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.958
Mr. Simon.

697
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.541
Listen to me.

698
01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:23.666
I'm a cop…

699
01:15:26.416 --> 01:15:28.458
not a lapdog.

700
01:15:30.666 --> 01:15:32.500
I'm not a lapdog.

701
01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:30.083
<i>Your fate depends on you.</i>

702
01:16:30.625 --> 01:16:34.166
Change your route and you'll be safe.

703
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.083
{\an8}A NOTORIOUS MURDER
FIVE PEOPLE KILLED AT TENNIS COURT

704
01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:20.708
<i>Everyone parted ways.</i>

705
01:17:21.333 --> 01:17:24.333
<i>I announced</i>
<i>that I would sell my gun again.</i>

706
01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:26.375
<i>Not long after.</i>

707
01:17:27.166 --> 01:17:29.583
<i>a mysterious man contacted me.</i>

708
01:17:37.291 --> 01:17:38.541
Are you Ja-Chai?

709
01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:40.458
And who are you?

710
01:17:42.416 --> 01:17:44.083
You don't need to know.

711
01:17:44.166 --> 01:17:47.583
I'm no one. It doesn't matter who I am.

712
01:17:47.666 --> 01:17:48.875
So. no name?

713
01:17:49.541 --> 01:17:51.416
You can call me anything.

714
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.791
Anything.

715
01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:56.083
Do you have the goods?

716
01:17:56.166 --> 01:17:57.791
I do.

717
01:17:57.875 --> 01:17:58.833
Can I see it?

718
01:17:58.916 --> 01:17:59.791
Five million?

719
01:18:01.958 --> 01:18:05.333
One hundred-year-old golden revolver.

720
01:18:06.791 --> 01:18:09.000
Now. take me to the buyer.

721
01:18:09.625 --> 01:18:10.791
‪Go.

722
01:18:31.416 --> 01:18:32.833
Where is your buyer?

723
01:18:37.791 --> 01:18:40.958
Hey. calm down. We are on the same team!

724
01:18:41.041 --> 01:18:43.041
I'm not. I'm a cop.

725
01:18:43.125 --> 01:18:44.833
Of course. you are!

726
01:18:44.916 --> 01:18:47.833
And is it wrong to hug a cop?

727
01:18:47.916 --> 01:18:49.833
Get off me!

728
01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:52.166
Let's have a seat.

729
01:18:53.291 --> 01:18:55.416
I am the buyer.

730
01:19:01.375 --> 01:19:02.708
Fucking liar.

731
01:19:04.125 --> 01:19:05.500
Ja-Chai.

732
01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:09.208
this is Thod 's brother's pizza place.

733
01:19:10.166 --> 01:19:14.291
It became run-down like this
because Singh died.

734
01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:17.708
Simon killed him.

735
01:19:19.291 --> 01:19:22.125
What are you trying to say?
You don't make any sense.

736
01:19:24.166 --> 01:19:27.625
Alright. listen carefully.

737
01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:43.583
<i>At the same time.</i>

738
01:19:44.416 --> 01:19:48.833
<i>poor Fah is confined in Simon's hotel.</i>

739
01:19:49.583 --> 01:19:51.833
<i>She faces her fear.</i>

740
01:19:51.916 --> 01:19:54.500
<i>waiting on the trial of her fate.</i>

741
01:20:00.208 --> 01:20:02.541
How much longer do I have to stay here?

742
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:06.291
Why? You don't like this place?

743
01:20:06.375 --> 01:20:07.625
I don't.

744
01:20:09.041 --> 01:20:11.375
I want to be free.

745
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:21.875
Freedom.

746
01:20:22.875 --> 01:20:24.625
You want freedom?

747
01:20:27.166 --> 01:20:30.500
Freedom after killing someone?

748
01:20:32.083 --> 01:20:33.500
I did not.

749
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.125
You did it.

750
01:20:39.958 --> 01:20:41.333
Oh. Fah.

751
01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:45.666
I can hire hundreds of people

752
01:20:46.375 --> 01:20:50.083
to testify that you killed him.

753
01:20:52.291 --> 01:20:53.708
You're a monster.

754
01:20:57.083 --> 01:20:58.000
A devil!

755
01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:04.541
I love you.

756
01:21:06.958 --> 01:21:08.166
I love you.

757
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I really love you.

758
01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:17.291
I don't care about your feelings.

759
01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:21.666
I only know that this is the first time
where I felt like

760
01:21:22.666 --> 01:21:25.541
I wanted to protect this woman.

761
01:21:25.625 --> 01:21:29.000
I wanted to win over this woman!
Make this woman mine!

762
01:21:29.083 --> 01:21:32.041
Make my kingdom her kingdom!

763
01:21:32.125 --> 01:21:34.416
To give her my whole world.

764
01:21:35.416 --> 01:21:38.166
And look at you and how you treated me!

765
01:21:38.250 --> 01:21:42.583
I gave you everything.
You just had to stay here for a few days!

766
01:21:42.666 --> 01:21:47.708
Do you think
you fucking deserve my love? Answer me!

767
01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:54.791
Mr. Simon.

768
01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:01.416
Just don't leave me.

769
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:04.708
Hey. do me a favor.

770
01:22:04.791 --> 01:22:06.458
Give Thod a call.

771
01:22:06.541 --> 01:22:08.125
Everybody sit down and talk.

772
01:22:08.208 --> 01:22:09.250
Okay?

773
01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:11.333
It's time to end it.

774
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:31.291
And that's the story.

775
01:22:32.666 --> 01:22:38.458
Poor Singh. He lost everything
because of Simon.

776
01:22:38.541 --> 01:22:39.708
And?

777
01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:42.625
- This has nothing to do with the gold?
- Yes.

778
01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:45.125
Nothing to do with the gold.

779
01:22:45.208 --> 01:22:48.041
But we're doing this
because it's the right thing.

780
01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:50.625
We want to avenge Singh.

781
01:22:50.708 --> 01:22:52.208
That has even less to do with me!

782
01:22:53.416 --> 01:22:56.583
What matters is that you stole the gold

783
01:22:56.666 --> 01:22:59.458
and made my life a living hell.

784
01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:03.250
You're in too deep now.

785
01:23:03.333 --> 01:23:06.208
It wouldn't be a cakewalk
to just leave now.

786
01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:11.125
Or you can turn a blind eye

787
01:23:11.208 --> 01:23:13.000
and once it all ends.

788
01:23:13.083 --> 01:23:15.125
you can spend all your money
on your daughter.

789
01:23:15.708 --> 01:23:18.375
Treat your daughter with the money.

790
01:23:18.458 --> 01:23:22.833
but never return this to Simon.

791
01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:31.083
And only then will I pay
for the golden gun.

792
01:23:34.875 --> 01:23:37.708
<i>In fact. Singh doesn't have</i>
<i>anything to do with me.</i>

793
01:23:38.583 --> 01:23:39.833
<i>It's all about the money.</i>

794
01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:42.416
<i>I slowly thought of a new plan</i>

795
01:23:43.291 --> 01:23:45.458
<i>to save them…</i>

796
01:23:45.541 --> 01:23:47.958
I'll call you.

797
01:23:48.041 --> 01:23:49.916
<i>…and also. my retirement plan.</i>

798
01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:11.500
MEMBERS ONLY
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

799
01:24:41.625 --> 01:24:43.416
<i>As for Gee's money.</i>

800
01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:46.583
<i>my daughter was taken to a hospital.</i>

801
01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:50.625
<i>Her treatment and payment</i>
<i>were done before the New Year.</i>

802
01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:53.791
<i>That included my resignation letter. too.</i>

803
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.750
<i>Everything went according to Gee's plan.</i>

804
01:24:58.875 --> 01:24:59.791
<i>No.</i>

805
01:25:01.458 --> 01:25:03.083
<i>It's my plan.</i>

806
01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.041
I told you I didn't have a weapon.

807
01:25:54.875 --> 01:25:56.125
Smell of blood.

808
01:26:00.833 --> 01:26:02.375
What smell of blood?

809
01:26:05.666 --> 01:26:07.333
I can smell blood.

810
01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:10.166
It's everywhere.

811
01:26:18.666 --> 01:26:19.750
Come in.

812
01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:23.708
Come in!

813
01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:49.041
<i>Have you ever been to Hong Kong. Fah?</i>

814
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.791
This is a flight ticket to Hong Kong.

815
01:27:02.458 --> 01:27:04.958
Once you get there.
you'll get another three million baht.

816
01:27:09.708 --> 01:27:10.833
What do you mean?

817
01:27:11.833 --> 01:27:13.708
Why should I go to Hong Kong?

818
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:17.958
To change your story.

819
01:27:19.916 --> 01:27:21.458
What story?

820
01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:23.916
Tell me what happened to Singh.

821
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.083
Fah.

822
01:27:35.791 --> 01:27:38.958
If you tell the truth.
you can fly away with the money.

823
01:27:47.875 --> 01:27:49.750
I'm sorry. Thod.

824
01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:54.333
Since the incident.
I've been afraid to see you.

825
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:04.541
<i>Gee called me that day.</i>

826
01:28:05.208 --> 01:28:08.083
<i>She told me that Mr. Simon</i>
<i>wanted to own Angel Pizza jointly.</i>

827
01:28:08.166 --> 01:28:10.250
<i>So. I met him here. in this room.</i>

828
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:14.500
<i>Mr. Simon wanted to open</i>
<i>Angel Pizza here. in Lion Star.</i>

829
01:28:14.583 --> 01:28:16.500
<i>We negotiated our agreement.</i>

830
01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.416
<i>Everything went so well.</i>

831
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.458
<i>Mr. Simon asked Singh to sign the contract</i>

832
01:28:22.541 --> 01:28:25.125
<i>and told him to bring pizzas to celebrate.</i>

833
01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:28.291
<i>While Singh was here. he got upset</i>

834
01:28:28.791 --> 01:28:30.833
<i>seeing me with Mr. Simon.</i>

835
01:28:32.416 --> 01:28:34.166
<i>He had always been this way.</i>

836
01:28:34.708 --> 01:28:36.500
<i>Whenever he saw me with another man.</i>

837
01:28:36.583 --> 01:28:39.375
- Angel Pizza!
- <i>he would burst with anger.</i>

838
01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:45.541
<i>In reality. Mr. Simon</i>
<i>only picked up the wrong glass.</i>

839
01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:47.416
<i>He mistakenly picked up my glass.</i>

840
01:28:49.333 --> 01:28:52.416
<i>Mr. Simon didn't want to hurt Singh.</i>

841
01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:56.541
<i>He knew that as small as Singh was.</i>
<i>he didn't stand a chance.</i>

842
01:28:58.791 --> 01:29:00.541
<i>Mr. Simon walked away.</i>

843
01:29:00.625 --> 01:29:02.541
<i>but Singh wouldn't stop.</i>

844
01:29:08.458 --> 01:29:10.500
<i>I later heard from the police</i>

845
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.708
that Singh chased Mr. Simon down the road.

846
01:29:16.375 --> 01:29:18.625
Singh crashed into a tree.

847
01:29:21.083 --> 01:29:22.125
I'm sorry.

848
01:29:23.083 --> 01:29:24.666
but can I say something?

849
01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:27.291
That day. I sat there.

850
01:29:31.583 --> 01:29:33.250
What a lying bitch.

851
01:29:34.041 --> 01:29:36.083
You walked in.

852
01:29:36.166 --> 01:29:38.000
so I left.

853
01:29:38.833 --> 01:29:43.375
It just so happened that I planted
a cigarette box with a camera.

854
01:29:47.208 --> 01:29:48.916
It recorded everything.

855
01:29:51.458 --> 01:29:52.583
And right here…

856
01:29:54.958 --> 01:29:57.000
is where Singh died.

857
01:29:57.583 --> 01:29:58.791
Can you remember that?

858
01:30:00.791 --> 01:30:01.958
If you can't.

859
01:30:03.625 --> 01:30:05.416
how about we watch a short movie?

860
01:30:10.708 --> 01:30:13.125
It seems that this
won't be easy to handle.

861
01:30:15.958 --> 01:30:19.791
So?

862
01:30:20.375 --> 01:30:23.250
One of us has to die. Is that right?

863
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.250
Hi. everyone! <i>Konnichiwa</i>!

864
01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:57.666
Ja-Chai. what's this?

865
01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:01.708
Mr. Simon.

866
01:31:02.291 --> 01:31:03.750
I retired today!

867
01:31:05.333 --> 01:31:08.625
Retire? That's none of my business.

868
01:31:09.208 --> 01:31:12.291
It matters to you. actually.
This is a good day.

869
01:31:12.375 --> 01:31:18.041
We'll take in the good things
and forget all the bad things.

870
01:31:18.125 --> 01:31:22.041
Hey! Sak. go get some wine glasses!

871
01:31:22.125 --> 01:31:24.625
- Get me champagne glasses!
- Mah! Get him out!

872
01:31:24.708 --> 01:31:27.041
- Get out.
- But the champagne!

873
01:31:27.125 --> 01:31:29.166
- Drink the champagne first!
- Get out!

874
01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:32.333
The cake's great too!
It's the best in Pattaya!

875
01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:34.125
‪Enough! Bastards!

876
01:31:34.208 --> 01:31:37.083
Alright. alright. Get off me now!

877
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.458
Stop! Don't follow me.

878
01:31:42.083 --> 01:31:42.958
‪Stop!

879
01:31:44.333 --> 01:31:46.416
You fuckers can't stop nagging me!

880
01:31:49.375 --> 01:31:50.500
I'll show myself out.

881
01:31:52.083 --> 01:31:53.375
Don't touch me.

882
01:31:54.250 --> 01:31:56.833
Fuck off! Motherfucker!

883
01:31:57.666 --> 01:31:59.458
Simon is my friend.

884
01:31:59.541 --> 01:32:00.958
I can do anything I want.

885
01:32:01.041 --> 01:32:04.166
Stop nagging me. for fuck's sake.

886
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:29.625
The kitchen is closed today. sir.

887
01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:37.416
Are you here for revenge on me?

888
01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:38.500
No.

889
01:32:40.166 --> 01:32:41.708
I'm here…

890
01:32:42.958 --> 01:32:46.833
to forgive you.

891
01:32:48.083 --> 01:32:49.541
I don't believe you.

892
01:32:51.083 --> 01:32:52.583
Take off your clothes.

893
01:33:16.833 --> 01:33:18.291
Just go.

894
01:33:24.625 --> 01:33:25.500
I said go.

895
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:31.125
I'm the stupid one.

896
01:33:34.666 --> 01:33:37.583
I always meet the wrong people
at the wrong time.

897
01:33:40.625 --> 01:33:43.791
And I always make the wrong choices.

898
01:33:47.166 --> 01:33:50.208
I ran out of chances to go back
and fix anything.

899
01:33:52.166 --> 01:33:54.125
But you still can.

900
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.833
Leave now or things will get even worse.

901
01:33:59.916 --> 01:34:01.000
Fah.

902
01:34:03.583 --> 01:34:06.416
You can go. I won't hurt you.

903
01:34:09.791 --> 01:34:10.916
Really?

904
01:34:20.083 --> 01:34:20.916
Go!

905
01:34:24.833 --> 01:34:26.041
Just go.

906
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.750
Goodbye. Fah.

907
01:34:36.958 --> 01:34:38.041
Go!

908
01:35:22.375 --> 01:35:24.291
- Follow him.
- Quickly!

909
01:35:24.375 --> 01:35:25.708
Follow Mr. Simon.

910
01:36:53.333 --> 01:36:55.041
What is your plan?

911
01:36:56.458 --> 01:36:58.333
Think about it.

912
01:36:59.708 --> 01:37:02.166
At such an important moment.

913
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:07.291
Simon's two best thugs are here. with me.

914
01:37:07.375 --> 01:37:10.166
So. who's protecting him?

915
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:11.250
No!

916
01:37:36.416 --> 01:37:38.083
Die. fucker!

917
01:37:41.916 --> 01:37:44.166
Die!

918
01:38:24.833 --> 01:38:25.958
Asshole!

919
01:40:11.791 --> 01:40:12.750
Simon!

920
01:40:27.041 --> 01:40:28.708
<i>To the rooftop now!</i>

921
01:40:29.708 --> 01:40:34.291
<i>Mah. we need you on the rooftop! Quickly!</i>

922
01:40:36.416 --> 01:40:37.416
Copy that.

923
01:41:31.250 --> 01:41:34.541
I'll take your other eye. fucker!

924
01:41:34.625 --> 01:41:39.291
Forgive me. I'm sorry.
You must forgive me.

925
01:41:52.708 --> 01:41:55.166
I want to know
what an eyeless eye socket looks like.

926
01:41:55.250 --> 01:41:56.291
Is it just a hole?

927
01:42:01.041 --> 01:42:02.625
What do you see?

928
01:42:03.458 --> 01:42:05.125
What does it look like?

929
01:42:06.916 --> 01:42:09.791
What do you fucking see?

930
01:42:09.875 --> 01:42:11.791
What do you fucking see?

931
01:42:45.875 --> 01:42:46.916
Gee.

932
01:43:12.291 --> 01:43:13.250
Gee.

933
01:43:15.041 --> 01:43:17.125
I thought we were friends!

934
01:43:17.208 --> 01:43:19.000
I thought we were friends.

935
01:43:19.083 --> 01:43:20.208
Why the fuck did you do this to me?

936
01:43:20.291 --> 01:43:21.833
I won't fucking tell you.

937
01:43:21.916 --> 01:43:24.458
Why the fuck did you do this to me?

938
01:43:24.541 --> 01:43:26.791
Get off me. cunt!

939
01:44:46.916 --> 01:44:47.916
Thod!

940
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:50.416
Stop right there. Simon!

941
01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:52.208
- Ja-Chai?
- It's me!

942
01:44:52.791 --> 01:44:54.333
- Fucking Chai.
- I'll shoot!

943
01:44:54.416 --> 01:44:55.541
Motherfucker!

944
01:44:56.833 --> 01:44:59.958
You killed Singh and Nicholas

945
01:45:00.041 --> 01:45:01.625
- and now him?
- What the fuck?

946
01:45:01.708 --> 01:45:02.666
Hey! Hey! Hey!

947
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:05.333
- Step back all the way!
- Ja-Chai. calm down!

948
01:45:05.416 --> 01:45:08.375
Let's talk. What do you want?

949
01:45:08.458 --> 01:45:10.083
- Money?
- Keep that!

950
01:45:10.166 --> 01:45:12.666
So. what the fuck do you want?

951
01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:14.541
I want to be a good cop.

952
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.500
not a fucking lapdog!

953
01:45:17.583 --> 01:45:19.958
- Step back!
- Wait!

954
01:45:20.041 --> 01:45:21.208
Okay. okay!

955
01:45:21.291 --> 01:45:23.916
You want to be a good cop. right?

956
01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:27.291
Of course. I surrender.

957
01:45:27.375 --> 01:45:30.333
I surrender. Arrest me! Take me to jail.

958
01:45:30.916 --> 01:45:32.458
Arrest me! You see?

959
01:45:32.541 --> 01:45:33.625
I surrender.

960
01:45:33.708 --> 01:45:34.875
I surrender.

961
01:45:35.458 --> 01:45:36.875
But I'm retired.

962
01:45:37.875 --> 01:45:38.875
I can't arrest you anymore.

963
01:45:41.041 --> 01:45:43.458
- I'd better shoot you!
- Shit! Calm down!

964
01:45:45.041 --> 01:45:48.041
But there's someone
who may want to shoot you even more.

965
01:45:48.916 --> 01:45:50.041
I'm fine with that.

966
01:45:51.333 --> 01:45:52.458
Right?

967
01:46:10.916 --> 01:46:12.833
Where are you? Come out here!

968
01:46:17.625 --> 01:46:18.875
Where are you?

969
01:46:20.833 --> 01:46:22.791
Hok! Where are you?

970
01:46:22.875 --> 01:46:23.750
Fucking Hok!

971
01:46:26.958 --> 01:46:29.458
Hok! Where are you?

972
01:46:29.541 --> 01:46:32.625
I forgive you.

973
01:46:34.208 --> 01:46:35.291
‪Oh. Mah.

974
01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.166
It's too late.

975
01:46:51.208 --> 01:46:53.041
I'm still alive.

976
01:46:54.666 --> 01:46:56.500
I won't die that easily!

977
01:46:56.583 --> 01:46:58.500
Is that all you've got?

978
01:46:58.583 --> 01:46:59.750
Mah!

979
01:47:03.333 --> 01:47:06.166
Is that all you've got. bastards?

980
01:47:08.208 --> 01:47:09.583
<i>Beautiful.</i>

981
01:47:09.666 --> 01:47:11.625
<i>Thod killed Simon.</i>

982
01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:14.333
<i>Hok killed Mah.</i>

983
01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:18.500
<i>I was just a clumsy retired cop</i>

984
01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:21.208
<i>who dropped a gun into Thod's hand.</i>

985
01:47:23.250 --> 01:47:25.666
<i>I'm taking my daughter</i>
<i>out of the hospital.</i>

986
01:47:27.708 --> 01:47:30.333
<i>and we'll celebrate the New Year together.</i>

987
01:47:55.666 --> 01:47:56.791
Video this way?

988
01:47:56.875 --> 01:47:59.458
Yes. and record it.

989
01:47:59.541 --> 01:48:01.583
- Yeah. look over there. too.
- Film this and this.

990
01:48:01.666 --> 01:48:03.958
Okay. and film this. too.

991
01:48:04.041 --> 01:48:05.083
Okay.

992
01:48:06.083 --> 01:48:08.750
- How about a selfie?
- Yay!

993
01:48:08.833 --> 01:48:09.958
Okay.

994
01:48:12.625 --> 01:48:14.166
Beautiful.

995
01:48:16.750 --> 01:48:18.333
- Don't forget to record a video. Dad.
- Yes.

996
01:48:18.416 --> 01:48:20.625
Dad. I want ice cream.

997
01:48:20.708 --> 01:48:22.166
- Huh?
- I want ice cream.

998
01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:23.541
Ice cream?

999
01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:25.791
Alright.

1000
01:48:25.875 --> 01:48:27.500
I'm getting you some.

1001
01:48:29.125 --> 01:48:30.250
What flavor?

1002
01:48:30.333 --> 01:48:32.666
I'm thinking vanilla.

1003
01:48:33.458 --> 01:48:35.375
No problem. my lady.

1004
01:48:42.416 --> 01:48:45.000
One vanilla and one chocolate ice cream.

1005
01:48:49.708 --> 01:48:51.000
Thank you.

1006
01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:09.791
Do you remember me?

1007
01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:13.791
You were a policeman.

1008
01:49:13.875 --> 01:49:17.375
but you watched Simon cripple my hand.

1009
01:49:17.458 --> 01:49:19.291
Do you feel any remorse?

1010
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:25.791
Being called a cop has its price!

1011
01:49:26.375 --> 01:49:27.333
‪Die!

1012
01:49:39.958 --> 01:49:42.666
<i>I was stationed on this road</i>
<i>since I was newly graduated.</i>

1013
01:49:44.666 --> 01:49:47.083
<i>I always wanted to become a good cop.</i>

1014
01:49:48.583 --> 01:49:50.458
<i>However. that slowly changed.</i>

1015
01:49:51.125 --> 01:49:53.000
<i>I didn't want to give myself problems.</i>

1016
01:49:53.583 --> 01:49:56.333
<i>I've been working here for over 30 years.</i>

1017
01:50:00.375 --> 01:50:01.708
<i>I never knew</i>

1018
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:05.208
<i>if I've ever been a good cop.</i>

1019
01:50:18.708 --> 01:50:21.291
- Is this Ja-Chai's home?
- Yes.

1020
01:50:21.375 --> 01:50:23.375
Is he in?

1021
01:50:23.458 --> 01:50:25.583
He's not.

1022
01:50:29.125 --> 01:50:31.125
And who are you?

1023
01:50:31.208 --> 01:50:32.583
I'm his daughter.

1024
01:50:37.291 --> 01:50:38.708
Sign this. please.

1025
01:50:52.916 --> 01:50:54.625
<i>Now.</i>

1026
01:50:54.708 --> 01:50:56.500
<i>you probably realize</i>

1027
01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:59.000
<i>that this was all Gee's plan.</i>

1028
01:51:00.375 --> 01:51:01.958
<i>This was her plan.</i>

1029
01:51:03.541 --> 01:51:06.500
<i>a plan that led to everyone's death.</i>

1030
01:51:07.416 --> 01:51:09.666
<i>That doesn't bother her…</i>

1031
01:51:12.708 --> 01:51:15.125
<i>because several years earlier.</i>

1032
01:51:15.833 --> 01:51:19.250
<i>after she learned fortune-telling</i>
<i>and returned to Pattaya.</i>

1033
01:51:21.958 --> 01:51:23.916
<i>she had been waiting for this day.</i>

1034
01:51:25.041 --> 01:51:27.041
<i>as she knew</i>

1035
01:51:27.125 --> 01:51:28.583
<i>that no matter what.</i>

1036
01:51:29.291 --> 01:51:30.875
<i>this day would come.</i>
