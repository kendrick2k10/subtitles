Yeah.

62
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.674
She has become sensitive
to city noise.

63
00:06:10.718 --> 00:06:11.893
it's driving her crazy.

64
00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.724
Maybe consider moving
away from the city.

65
00:06:18.726 --> 00:06:21.555
I mean. that'd be nice.
but we can't afford that.

The best way for both of you
to pass this

67
00:06:25.472 --> 00:06:28.039
is to move to a new environment.

remind you of your loss.

Yeah?

81
00:07:05.773 --> 00:07:08.253
But you need to get up
every couple of hours.

82
00:07:08.297 --> 00:07:10.081
so you don't get
any blood clots.

83
00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:12.867
and I need you to promise me
you'll eat something

84
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.263
Don't forget to take
the Oxycodone for the pain

85
00:07:18.307 --> 00:07:19.439
and the meds I gave you.

86
00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:21.789

87
00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:28.448

I wish I could stay longer.

some of the soup I brought.

Oh. what happened?

555
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:19.190
She fell and hit her head.

556
00:50:19.233 --> 00:50:20.669
Oh my God. is she okay?

557
00:50:20.713 --> 00:50:22.541
Yeah. I mean I was gonna
take her to hospital.

558
00:50:22.584 --> 00:50:24.369
but she knew
you were coming today. so.

559
00:50:24.412 --> 00:50:25.674
Oh. you could've called me.

560
00:50:25.718 --> 00:50:28.155
I-- I know. I--
I probably should have.

561
00:50:28.199 --> 00:50:29.765

[♪♪♪]

563
00:50:39.079 --> 00:50:41.908
And here's the kitchen.

564
00:50:41.951 --> 00:50:45.346
Antique. but that was
to be expected.

565
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:48.175
So how's it going so far.
being here?

566
00:50:48.219 --> 00:50:52.919
Well. actually it's uh.
it's been weird.

567
00:50:52.962 --> 00:50:54.790
Oh. I like it.

568
00:50:54.834 --> 00:50:56.183
Feels homey.

569
00:50:56.227 --> 00:50:58.968
Yeah. well. tell that to Val.

570
00:50:59.012 --> 00:51:00.057
What do you mean?

571
00:51:02.407 --> 00:51:04.539
I don't know. I guess
it just hasn't been as good

572
00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:06.063
as I thought it'd be.

573
00:51:06.106 --> 00:51:08.891
Well. she's going
through a lot. right?

574
00:51:08.935 --> 00:51:09.979
What do you expect?

575
00:51:10.023 --> 00:51:12.895
It's not just that. it's uh--

576
00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:13.809
CHLOE:
What?

577
00:51:15.681 --> 00:51:18.379
What. tell me.

578
00:51:18.423 --> 00:51:20.338
I saw something last night.

579
00:51:22.122 --> 00:51:25.169
Really? What'd you see?

580
00:51:27.997 --> 00:51:29.782
Ooh. what'd you see?

581
00:51:29.825 --> 00:51:32.132
[chuckles]

582
00:51:32.176 --> 00:51:34.830
What. a ghost?

[Chloe chuckles]

584
00:51:36.615 --> 00:51:38.399
Come on. Justin.

585
00:51:38.443 --> 00:51:40.575
No. you're still hurting
and grieving.

586
00:51:40.619 --> 00:51:42.316
You know. it's easy
to conjure things

587
00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.102
when you're confused
and heartbroken.

588
00:51:46.799 --> 00:51:48.105
It's good to see you.

589
00:51:49.062 --> 00:51:50.194
We missed you.

590
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:52.761
Wow.

591
00:51:52.805 --> 00:51:54.328
Sentimental Justin.

592
00:51:54.372 --> 00:51:56.113
Maybe you have seen a ghost.

593
00:51:56.156 --> 00:51:56.939
I can't win with you.

594
00:51:56.983 --> 00:51:58.332
[chuckles]

595
00:51:58.376 --> 00:52:01.118
Trust me. it was the right
decision to move here.

598
00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.735
Justin!

[indistinct speech]

600
00:53:43.742 --> 00:53:45.265
The men. I know it's hard.
because you know.

601
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:46.701
I know it's hard on you. too.

602
00:53:46.745 --> 00:53:48.703
I mean. it happened to her.
but it happened to you.

603
00:53:48.747 --> 00:53:50.009
you know.

604
00:53:50.052 --> 00:53:51.880
So it's-- so you have to worry
about you. too.

606
00:53:53.186 --> 00:53:54.709
Oh my gosh.
when'd you get here?

607
00:53:54.753 --> 00:53:56.885
[gasps] Oh. so good to see you!

So good to see you!

609
00:53:58.147 --> 00:53:59.366
Oh my gosh.

610
00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.628
-Oh my go--
-I got in just a little bit ago.

-Yeah.

613
00:54:03.762 --> 00:54:05.154
I'll let you guys catch up.
I got some work

614
00:54:05.198 --> 00:54:05.633
to do in the back. okay.

615
00:54:05.677 --> 00:54:06.591
Okay. hon.

616
00:54:08.636 --> 00:54:09.724
I'm so glad you made it okay.

617
00:54:09.768 --> 00:54:11.248
[indistinct speech]

618
00:54:11.291 --> 00:54:12.597
Can I get you something
to drink?

619
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.251
-Oh--
-I have some wine. soda. water?

620
00:54:14.294 --> 00:54:15.469
Yeah. wine will be great.

621
00:54:15.513 --> 00:54:17.428
-Okay. I'll be right back.

Make yourself comfy. hon.

00:54:19.343 --> 00:54:21.258
Oh. I love this place.

[pouring in back]

625
00:54:35.663 --> 00:54:36.925
And here you go!

626
00:54:36.969 --> 00:54:38.231
Thanks. hon.

627
00:54:38.275 --> 00:54:39.276
Wanna come to the couch
and we can get comfy?

628
00:54:39.319 --> 00:54:42.104
Yeah. sure. yeah.

629
00:54:42.148 --> 00:54:43.105
You look amazing.

630
00:54:43.149 --> 00:54:44.498
Oh. thank you. hon.

631
00:54:44.542 --> 00:54:46.195
I still got a couple pounds
on me. but--

632
00:54:46.239 --> 00:54:47.588
Oh. stop.

633
00:54:47.632 --> 00:54:48.589
[chuckles]

634
00:54:48.633 --> 00:54:49.329
No.

635
00:54:49.373 --> 00:54:50.765
So. how are you feeling?

636
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:52.593
I've actually been feeling
pretty good--

637
00:54:52.637 --> 00:54:53.986
-CHLOE: Yeah.
-Except for the dizziness.

638
00:54:54.029 --> 00:54:55.292
That's why I had called you.

639
00:54:55.335 --> 00:54:57.294
Yeah. I think it might be
the altitude.

640
00:54:57.337 --> 00:54:58.643
VAL:
You think?

641
00:54:58.686 --> 00:54:59.992
Yeah. I was feeling weird
when I got up here.

642
00:55:00.035 --> 00:55:01.776
I thought it was the meds.

643
00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.301
Mm. I don't know. I think
it might be the altitude.

644
00:55:04.344 --> 00:55:05.476
I never thought about that.

645
00:55:05.519 --> 00:55:06.651
See. I needed you. girl.

646
00:55:06.694 --> 00:55:09.131
Oh. you're so sweet.
I needed you.

647
00:55:09.175 --> 00:55:10.307
VAL:
Oh.

648
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:11.786
So what about you. hon?

649
00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:14.006
Are you still dating
that surgeon?

650
00:55:14.049 --> 00:55:15.486
No.

651
00:55:15.529 --> 00:55:17.662
-He turned out to be confused.
-What?

652
00:55:17.705 --> 00:55:20.360
Yeah. he told me once in a while
he likes to date men.

653
00:55:20.404 --> 00:55:21.796
-No.
-CHLOE: Yeah.

654
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.625
Really sad.
'cause he has a big one.

655
00:55:24.669 --> 00:55:25.322
No.

656
00:55:25.365 --> 00:55:29.630
[laughing]

657
00:55:29.674 --> 00:55:31.328
Well. at least
he had something good.

658
00:55:31.371 --> 00:55:33.765
[laughing]

659
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:38.639
So how are you adjusting
to the new home?

660
00:55:38.683 --> 00:55:42.817
Well. at first I was excited.
but I recently found out that

661
00:55:42.861 --> 00:55:44.732
the previous owner
was killed here.

662
00:55:46.125 --> 00:55:48.475
Oh. don't worry. hon.

663
00:55:48.519 --> 00:55:50.216
It's actually pretty common
for people to die

664
00:55:50.259 --> 00:55:51.478
in their homes.

665
00:55:51.522 --> 00:55:54.699
Yeah. I know.
but this man was murdered here.

666
00:55:56.048 --> 00:55:58.485
Oh. Maybe he deserved it.

667
00:55:58.529 --> 00:56:00.008
VAL:
Chloe!

668
00:56:00.052 --> 00:56:02.620
I'm just saying. you never know.

669
00:56:03.882 --> 00:56:05.362
That's true.

670
00:56:09.757 --> 00:56:11.280
CHLOE:
Thanks for having me. guys.

671
00:56:11.324 --> 00:56:12.281
We needed a party.

672
00:56:12.325 --> 00:56:14.414
JUSTIN:
Woah. that looks nice.

673
00:56:17.591 --> 00:56:19.201
Mm.

674
00:56:19.245 --> 00:56:21.378
Can't believe Justin found
this Mexican restaurant

675
00:56:21.421 --> 00:56:22.509
in this small town.

676
00:56:22.553 --> 00:56:23.902
CHLOE:
Oh. that's great.

677
00:56:23.945 --> 00:56:26.034
I love Mexican food.
it's my favorite.

678
00:56:26.078 --> 00:56:28.515
It's my favorite. too.
that's why I married

679
00:56:28.559 --> 00:56:29.864
this Mexican woman.

680
00:56:29.908 --> 00:56:31.213

681
00:56:31.257 --> 00:56:33.868
[kiss]

682
00:56:33.912 --> 00:56:35.740
I hate to rain on the fun.
but I think

683
00:56:35.783 --> 00:56:39.047
you should switch out the wine
for some orange juice.

684
00:56:39.091 --> 00:56:40.092
Another one?

685
00:56:40.135 --> 00:56:42.224
Yes. you need your Vitamin C.

686
00:56:42.268 --> 00:56:43.704

[chuckle]

691
00:56:54.672 --> 00:56:58.066
So Justin.
how is the new business?

692
00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.241
-Good.
-CHLOE: Yeah?

693
00:56:59.285 --> 00:57:00.373
Yeah.

694
00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:01.722
Never thought
I'd own my own business.

695
00:57:01.766 --> 00:57:04.246
Oh. I always believed in you.

696
00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:05.291
Me too.

697
00:57:05.334 --> 00:57:06.423
I always told him
he could do it.

698
00:57:06.466 --> 00:57:07.598
Thanks.

Right. really good.

701

Chloe told me she's not dating
that guy anymore.

702
00:57:16.128 --> 00:57:17.129
Mm-mm. [chuckling]

703
00:57:17.172 --> 00:57:19.131
JUSTIN:
Really. what happened now?

704
00:57:20.306 --> 00:57:21.089
You don't wanna know.

705
00:57:21.133 --> 00:57:21.655
CHLOE:
Yeah.

706
00:57:21.699 --> 00:57:23.440
[all chuckle]

707
00:57:23.483 --> 00:57:24.963
Alright.

708
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:27.356
Girl stuff.

709
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.619

Mhmm.

713
00:57:37.802 --> 00:57:39.847
Just started to feel
a little heavy.

714
00:57:43.808 --> 00:57:46.114
-CHLOE: Hon.
-Oh. shoot.

715

CHLOE:
Hon. if you're feeling tired.
I mean.

717
00:57:48.813 --> 00:57:49.640
why don't you go lie down
for a little bit.

718
00:57:49.683 --> 00:57:51.119
Justin and I can catch up.

719
00:57:51.163 --> 00:57:52.207
You sure?

720
00:57:52.251 --> 00:57:52.947
I don't wanna leave you here.
hon.

721
00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:54.775
No. stop. no.

722
00:57:54.819 --> 00:57:55.907
Go rest.

723
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:57.038
We'll have plenty
of time together.

724
00:57:57.082 --> 00:57:58.649
-VAL: You sure?
-Yes.

725
00:57:58.692 --> 00:58:00.607
Okay. maybe I'll just lay down.

726
00:58:00.651 --> 00:58:02.522
-JUSTIN: Alright.
-Go take care of yourself.

727
00:58:02.566 --> 00:58:04.002
I'll catch up with you
in a little.

CHLOE:
Alright. sweety.

729
00:58:05.351 --> 00:58:06.657
JUSTIN:
I'll keep that for you.

730
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:08.572
-Oh.
-JUSTIN: Come on.

-You alright?
-VAL: Yeah. I'm fine.

732

Ain't no one worth
giving away your happiness.

1014
01:24:35.287 --> 01:24:39.596
I was married once to
a real son of a bitch.

1015
01:24:41.641 --> 01:24:44.427
I was so in love with him
at the beginning.

1016
01:24:47.778 --> 01:24:49.084
I'd do everything for him.

1017
01:24:51.825 --> 01:24:53.436
Even when I was dead tired.

1018
01:24:54.437 --> 01:24:56.439
God. how I loved that man.

1019
01:24:59.485 --> 01:25:02.097
And then one day.
he cheated on me.

1020
01:25:05.317 --> 01:25:06.797
It really hurt me.

1021
01:25:09.147 --> 01:25:10.801
Deep inside.

1022
01:25:14.152 --> 01:25:16.415
And then what did I do.
like an idiot.

1023
01:25:16.459 --> 01:25:18.156
I gave him a second chance.

1024
01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.810
'cause I was so in love with
him.

1025
01:25:19.853 --> 01:25:21.507
And guess what?
He did it again.

1026
01:25:26.643 --> 01:25:28.775
Then when I was trying
to get rid of him.

1027
01:25:28.819 --> 01:25:30.777
he kept coming back.

1028
01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:36.000
He was crying.
begging me to take him back.

1029
01:25:36.043 --> 01:25:37.828
One night

1030
01:25:37.871 --> 01:25:40.787
when I was asleep in my bed.
it's the middle of the night.

1031
01:25:40.831 --> 01:25:44.704
he breaks into my house
and crawls into my bed.

1032
01:25:44.748 --> 01:25:47.794
And I pulled a knife on him.
which I happen to have handy.

1033
01:25:47.838 --> 01:25:49.666
And I put it right to his neck.

1034
01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:52.147
And I looked him in the eye.
and I said.

1035
01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:53.496
"You ever come back here again.

1036
01:25:53.539 --> 01:25:55.715

wide open."

1037
01:26:04.507 --> 01:26:06.509

There ain't nothing gonna
fill 'em up.

01:26:17.911 --> 01:26:21.828
Don't let anyone step on you.

Good. My name's John.

1130
01:33:12.674 --> 01:33:14.414
I was the first person
on the scene

1131
01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:16.155
after your neighbor Frank
found you.

1132
01:33:17.548 --> 01:33:18.854
How you feeling?

We're happy about that.
We were all worried.

1135
01:33:24.947 --> 01:33:26.601
You've been out a long time.

1136
01:33:29.691 --> 01:33:31.954

on getting better.

Hey. but. Valerie.
while I'm here.

1145
01:33:55.978 --> 01:33:58.807
can I ask you just one question?

1146
01:33:58.850 --> 01:34:02.375
There's this thing
that has me so curious.

Chloe Sanders.

1148
01:34:05.204 --> 01:34:08.773
Her body was dragged
from the kitchen

1149
01:34:08.817 --> 01:34:10.383
all the way down
to the basement.

1150
01:34:10.427 --> 01:34:14.300
Now. could you have any idea
how that could have happened?

1151
01:34:14.344 --> 01:34:16.041

Okay.

1155
01:34:25.224 --> 01:34:27.313
Okay. okay. it's alright.

1156
01:34:27.357 --> 01:34:29.664
Tell you what. Valerie.
I'm gonna come by another time.

1157
01:34:30.708 --> 01:34:32.797
Maybe a better time
for you to chat.

1158
01:34:32.841 --> 01:34:35.321
Sorry to bother you right now.

1159
01:34:35.365 --> 01:34:37.019
Okay. thank you.

NURSE:
I'm sorry. Valerie.

1161
01:34:41.763 --> 01:34:43.678
He's just-- he's been clamoring
to see you

1162
01:34:43.721 --> 01:34:46.332
and there's nothing
you can really do

1163
01:34:46.376 --> 01:34:47.986
until you get some rest.

1164
01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:50.946
Because I need you strong
for you and your baby.

1165
01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:53.688
What?

1166
01:34:55.864 --> 01:34:57.213
Oh. you didn't know.

1167
01:34:58.388 --> 01:35:01.696
Valerie. you're pregnant.

1168
01:35:01.739 --> 01:35:05.743
You're gonna have a baby.
it's a miracle.

1169
01:35:05.787 --> 01:35:08.093
The Lord
is watching out for you.

1170
01:35:09.399 --> 01:35:10.748
It's an angel baby.

1171
01:35:21.803 --> 01:35:23.543
