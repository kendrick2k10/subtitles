Hands on the steering wheel!

21
00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.390
- All right. all right.

22
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.627
- Why is she still in the car?

23
00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.462
Passenger. exit the vehicle!

24
00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:03.296

be used against you in a court of law.

27

- [SWAT Member] Anything you say may be used

28
00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.575
against you in a court of law.

29
00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:20.814
- You might as well make it easy on yourself.

30
00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:21.748
- Let's go.

31
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.353

33
00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.364
- [Mya VO] My first day as a senior.

34
00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:41.634
I waited four agonizing years for it to come.

35
00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:42.902
I'm Mya Campbell.

36
00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:45.572
The definition of teen perfection.

37
00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:48.575
I wish I could just fast forward to graduation day.

38
00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.709
Class of 1998.

39
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.113
- [LaTanya] Mya!

40
00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:55.915
Wake up and get ready for school now!

41
00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:04.324
- [Mya VO] My mom is a professional lawyer and a drawlbox.

42
00:02:04.324 --> 00:02:08.094
Let me get my ass up and focus on my number one priority.

43
00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.663
What to wear on the first day of school.

44
00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.565
I have to be the flyest.

45
00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.901
My fans expect nothing less from me.

46
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.370
Who am I to disappoint them?

47
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.039
(hip hop music)

48
00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:17.597
- I hate that rap music.

49
00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:20.366
Mya. don't forget to sign up for your SAT prep class.

50
00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:23.136
You have less than a year and you need to be ready.

51
00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.205
- Mom. it's the first day of school.

52
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.839
I ain't thinking about all that all right?

53
00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.241
- Mya. you need to start thinking

54
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.176
about your future as soon as possible.

55
00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.644
- Oh okay. sure.

56
00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.414
- Your grades were below average.

57
00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:37.717
And your reputation at Overbrook was not in good standing.

58
00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.652
If you were to listen to me and went

59
00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.988
to Lower Merion High School like I told you.

60
00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:44.023
you'd be a shoo-in the door

61
00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.993
for Spelman and Howard University.

62
00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:48.494
But no!

63
00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.129
You know how to work your father like a snake charmer.

64
00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.364
- Mom you tripping.

65
00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.298
- Tripping?

66
00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.836
Am I tripping when I pay your extravagant credit card bills?

67
00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.238
You may have your father wrapped

68
00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.440
around your finger. but not me. little girl.

69
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.611
- Mom. I don't have time for you or your accusations.

70
00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:07.947
- [LaTanya] And don't slam my damn door!

71
00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.452
(funk music)

72
00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:15.421
- [Mya VO] You see. my mom may run shit at home.

73
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.124
but here I'm the head bitch in charge.

74
00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:20.026
And all of the peasants bow down

75
00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.729
when Queen Mya come around.

76
00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.597
All the guys wish they could have me

77
00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.966
and all these hating ass bitches wished they rocked

78
00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.335
the fly gear that I always have first.

79
00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.104
Look at Kareema and her broke ass crew

80
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.273
still playing catch up in last year's gear.

81
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.276
Your bitches will always be in last place.

82
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.045
- Yo. I can't stand that bitch Mya!

83
00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:40.480
She swear she the shit!

84
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.249
- Girl fuck her and her fake ass crew.

85
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.618
Takia ain't nothing but a low budget whore.

86
00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.553
And. ooh. Raven.

87
00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:48.821
She swears she got one up on me

88
00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.924
just because Mally picked her over me.

89
00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:53.559
His fine ass though.

90
00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.296
He definitely missed out on a trophy over here.

91
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:58.264
- Girl please. they all whores.

92
00:04:58.264 --> 00:05:01.200
I be getting the 411 on every last one of them.

93
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.803
Let's just say they spend most of they time on they backs.

94
00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:07.106
- Look. I just know they better watch they step this year.

95
00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:10.176
I have a very low tolerance for hoes and they games.

96
00:05:10.176 --> 00:05:11.411
And I might just have to stomp

97
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.113
a mudhole in Mya's ass for graduation day.

98
00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:15.715
I mean that bitch dress fly. give her that.

99
00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:18.885
but her hands ain't no match for mine!

100
00:05:18.885 --> 00:05:20.353
Fuck out of here.

101
00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:21.554
- [Mya VO] See what I mean?

102
00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.623
Jealousy's a bitch ain't it?

103
00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:24.991
You're gonna get a few haters when you're

104
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.126
one of the baddest chicks in school.

105
00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:29.929
And me and my girls are definitely that.

106
00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:31.597
You can call me Cher from Clueless.

107
00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.933
but the ghetto fabulous version.

108
00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:36.002
Senior year here I come.

109
00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:37.737
- Oh my God. is that my bitch?

110
00:05:37.737 --> 00:05:39.906
- Baddest chicks in the house!

111
00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:40.840
- I missed y'all.

112
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.075
Hold up hold up. outfit check.

113
00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:43.142
You know we gotta be flyest

114
00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:44.277
the first day of our senior year.

115
00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.111
- Yeah.

116
00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:46.379
- All right.

117
00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.182
All right. Miss Takia. I see you in that Chanel.

118
00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:52.719
And you. Miss Raven. you looking real fly in that Fendi.

119
00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:53.953
- Thank you.

120
00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:55.121
- These haters gonna have a tough time

121
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.090
doing they job this year.

122
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.759
(hip hop music)

123
00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:11.404
(student chatter)

124
00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:29.922
- Read what I have written here on the blackboard.

125
00:06:29.922 --> 00:06:33.493
"Where will I be in five years after graduation?"

126
00:06:33.493 --> 00:06:36.729
Get this burned in your minds. people.

127
00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.398
You're seniors.

128
00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:40.099
And after this coming June.

129
00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:42.869
you have to face the real world.

130
00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:47.507
Some of you will attend prestigious universities.

131
00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:50.510
Some will develop skills and crafts.

132
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:55.515
And give them tools to be successful in life.

133
00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:56.749
While the rest?

134
00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.952
Jail and welfare will be waiting for you.

135
00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:04.090
- My whole family went to jail. I'm on my college tip.

136
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.558
- Yo. in like five years I'm gonna

137
00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:07.360
be signed to Bad Boy Records.

138
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.728
(students groan)

139
00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.763
- Crazy ice and my main man about that.

140
00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:13.699
- Nigga. you couldn't even get signed to Rip Off Records.

141
00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.001
- Man. why you hating?

142
00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:16.235
You know I'm nice on the mic.

143
00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.937
- Nigga your flow is played out like Kwame

144
00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.439
and those fucking polka dots.

145
00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.573
- Okay quiet down!

146
00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.108
I want silence!

147
00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:25.111
And with my knowledge and guidance.

148
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:29.415
I will make sure that none of my students are statistics.

149
00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:30.817
Yes. Ms. Scott.

150
00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:32.018
- Ms. Ashcroft.

151
00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:33.486
- [Ashcroft] Yes?

152
00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:36.989
- In five years I'll be a senior at Norfolk University.

153
00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:41.394
Studying pre-med with a degree in journalism.

154
00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.997
And hopefully I'll be interning at The Washington Post.

155
00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.166
Maybe even becoming the first

156
00:07:47.166 --> 00:07:50.336
female president of the United States!

157
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:54.240
Anything's possible through hard work and dedication.

158
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.575
- Now see. that's the type

159
00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:58.911
of grade A answer I'm looking for.

160
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.646
Who else would like to give us an example?

161
00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:01.881
- Ms. Ashcroft.

162
00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:06.486
I strive to always give 100%.

163
00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.387
Being captain of the debate team.

164
00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.289
editor of the school newspaper.

165
00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:14.760
the 1997 national spelling bee competition champ!

166
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.264
Oh. oh. and and this year's valedictorian!

167
00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:22.401
(Lisa cheers) (students boo)

168
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.403
I am willing to succeed.

169
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:27.406
- Lisa. shut your Jo-familiar ass up!

170
00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.542
You always dickying.

171
00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.878
We all in the same Magna program.

172
00:08:31.878 --> 00:08:33.412
You're not smarter than anybody just because

173
00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:36.015
you jump to lead every school activity.

174
00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:38.084
And that's only because you have

175
00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:41.454
no social life and fashion sense.

176
00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:43.956
And other words. you ain't got no guys

177
00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:47.727
on your line trying to check your corny ass out.

178
00:08:47.727 --> 00:08:51.597
- Just because I choose to put focus and emphasis

179
00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:55.835
into being an excellent student. while others

180
00:08:55.835 --> 00:08:59.372
choose to be loose plastic label whores.

181
00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.240
(students gasps)

182
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.376
We all have choices in life. sweetie.

183
00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:05.578
I'd rather be head of the class

184
00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:08.080
than in the back seat of some man's Jeep.

185
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.317
- Bitch. don't make me smack you so hard you turn retarded.

186
00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:14.153
- Mya that's so typical of your punk ass.

187
00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:16.923
You picking on defenseless Lisa Scott.

188
00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:18.824
but won't bust a grape in a fruit fight

189
00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:20.760
when a real bitch step to your ass.

190
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.262
(students oohing)

191
00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:24.931
- [Tee-Tee] She know she don't want no part.

192
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:27.466
She knows you'll break that ass up real quick.

193
00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:29.735
- Tee-Tee. stop being mascot for Team Kareema

194
00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:31.604
'cause you know we're gonna break shit up!

195
00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:33.105
- Girl. ain't nothing in this classroom

196
00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:35.207
but space and opportunity.

197
00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:39.312
(students hooting and hollering)

198
00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.584
- Yo yo yo yo!

199
00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.685
Y'all can't get along?

200
00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:47.019
This is for your own good.

201
00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:48.621
Let these hoes fight!

202
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:51.624
(students cheering)

203
00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:59.298
- Everybody calm down!

204
00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:00.900
Silence!

205
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.469
Mr. Brown. that is gonna be the last time

206
00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:05.338
you interrupt in this class today.

207
00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:08.007
Next time I will eject you from my class.

208
00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:11.277
And ladies. there will be no cat-fighting in my classroom.

209
00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.878
This is the first day of school.

210
00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:15.047
This is ridiculous.

211
00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:17.149
Excuse you. Ms. Campbell.

212
00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.486
There's no sun in this room.

213
00:10:20.486 --> 00:10:22.154
I need you to remove your shades.

214
00:10:22.154 --> 00:10:24.624
- Mrs. Ashcroft. these are $400 glasses.

215
00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:25.858
I need these on my face.

216
00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:27.593
- I don't care how much they cost.

217
00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:30.196
I'm gonna ask you one more time to take them off

218
00:10:30.196 --> 00:10:34.467
or I will be writing you a pink slip for suspension.

219
00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.968
Thank you.

220
00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:39.939
Now. Ms. Campbell. where do you see yourself in five years?

221
00:10:39.939 --> 00:10:41.974
- In five years I hope...

222
00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.045
I hope to never become like you.

223
00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:48.781
Because you're miserable and bitter.

224
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:51.117
And from what I hear you teachers earn.

225
00:10:51.117 --> 00:10:53.719
I could never afford these shoes on your salary.

226
00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:56.088
(bell rings)

227
00:10:58.858 --> 00:11:00.626
- Keep thinking you're cute. Ms. Campbell.

228
00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:01.861
- I am cute.

229
00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:04.163
Even Stevie Wonder can see that. lady.

230
00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:06.832
(hip hop music)

231
00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:17.543
- [Mya VO] In turn. the urban jungle

232
00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:20.112
called lunch is a complicated category.

233
00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:24.817
Because where you sit determines your rank and status.

234
00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:27.586
Oh God. I see Raheem and the wannabe

235
00:11:27.586 --> 00:11:30.089
rap niggas is starting that banging shit.

236
00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:33.426
free-styling that gibberish that nobody wants to hear.

237
00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:35.394
The Muslim kids have their own window area

238
00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:37.596
on lock looking like The Million Man March

239
00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:41.233
all garbed up in their kuthies and khimars for days.

240
00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:43.469
The fine male specimen of Overbrook's

241
00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:44.970
football and basketball team

242
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.006
sit in their own little world.

243
00:11:47.006 --> 00:11:48.774
They are some fine brothers.

244
00:11:48.774 --> 00:11:52.044
Just a little too light in the pockets for me.

245
00:11:52.044 --> 00:11:54.513
- Lisa Scott and the nerds swear they all that

246
00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:56.215
because they're a bunch of overachievers

247
00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:59.351
wearing wack gear on sale from Sears and K-Mart.

248
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.654
Her and her crew are the brains of Overbrook.

249
00:12:01.654 --> 00:12:04.323
But me and my bitches are the electricity

250
00:12:04.323 --> 00:12:06.726
that keeps lights on in this motherfucker.

251
00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.295
The only room left for the ghetto fabulous.

252
00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:12.531
And we occupy the building's most prized real estate.

253
00:12:12.531 --> 00:12:14.934
- Mya. what's up with you and that fool Carmello Green?

254
00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:16.535
- Oh that's my baby.

255
00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:19.071
We've been spending so much time together lately.

256
00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.539
I think he the one.

257
00:12:20.539 --> 00:12:22.341
There's just so many other bitches in the world.

258
00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:23.709
- Well the way he get them you gonna

259
00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:24.977
have deal with other bitches.

260
00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:26.679
- The way I see it. if he really feeling you

261
00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.380
the way you say he is. then he should

262
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.150
put them other chicks on the sideline.

263
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.586
- Rav. it's different when you're dealing with a hustler.

264
00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.421
Because there's so many other females.

265
00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:38.924
you gotta step up your game to tame them.

266
00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:41.494
- Mya. look at Smoke and Rocky.

267
00:12:44.697 --> 00:12:46.532
They irk my life.

268
00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:47.700
- Aww.

269
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.001
Smoke look cute.

270
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:50.970
- [Mya VO] Smoke was my first boyfriend.

271
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.639
He gave me my first taste of the street life.

272
00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:55.007
But I got bored.

273
00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:56.709
The streets were calling.

274
00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.010
- Look at Mya.

275
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.046
Boujie ass over there with her eyes at you.

276
00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:02.515
- I mean of course she gonna do that. man.

277
00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:03.916
I'm the one that broke her in.

278
00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:05.417
- Right. right.

279
00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:08.654
- Yeah. whoever asks her gonna have her feet all balled up.

280
00:13:08.654 --> 00:13:10.489
I remember in ninth grade. man.

281
00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:12.525
she already been ran through.

282
00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.393
- Now they talking about they on some next level shit.

283
00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:15.327
- Right. right.

284
00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:16.529
- Mya running around with that

285
00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:18.430
little nigga Mario from down the bottom.

286
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.832
- Like these chicks wouldn't know

287
00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:22.401
a real nigga from jawn-ass Versace. man.

288
00:13:22.401 --> 00:13:24.470
- But I like the quiet little jawn Raven.

289
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.437
She bad as shit.

290
00:13:25.437 --> 00:13:26.872
- [Rocky] Yo. you right. yo!

291
00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:28.941
I will bust Raven ass. yo.

292
00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:30.142
Real shit.

293
00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:32.311
- Yo. Raven look like Chili from TLC.

294
00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.979
- Right. right. right.

295
00:13:33.979 --> 00:13:35.848
- 'Cause I ain't going way back with Martin.

296
00:13:35.848 --> 00:13:36.916
I been stuck on that.

297
00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.417
- Word. word.

298
00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:40.419
- Yo. let's hit them dice in the bathroom real quick.

299
00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:44.857
Wanna take these mad street niggas' money real quick.

300
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:48.694
- What the fuck is they smell?

301
00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:53.699
I know they not eating them stinky ass (indistinct).

302
00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:57.670
- Get them. Tak.

303
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.637
- Excuse me.

304
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.507
Me and my girls down here trying to breathe

305
00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.008
and the smell of your stinking ass

306
00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:05.544
lunches is blocking our lungs.

307
00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:08.047
Y'all not even supposed to be at this table anyway.

308
00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:09.315
- Excuse me?

309
00:14:09.315 --> 00:14:10.249
We not moving.

310
00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:11.383
- She's not talking to us.

311
00:14:11.383 --> 00:14:13.152
She's not talking to us!

312
00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:13.986
Anyway!

313
00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:16.989
- Bitches. don't play with me.

314
00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:19.391
Get your stuff and go.

315
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.392
- Whatever.

316
00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:21.727
- You know what?

317
00:14:24.496 --> 00:14:26.599
- Quit messing with those special ed kids.

318
00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:28.734
They not bothering nobody.

319
00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:30.769
- They gotta fucking go.

320
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:33.439
- The smell. I couldn't take it.

321
00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:38.510
- [Raven VO] (sighs) I can't believe Mally is late again.

322
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.146
This is the third time in less than a week.

323
00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:43.282
I swear. sometimes he makes me

324
00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:45.985
just wanna scream and break up with his ass.

325
00:14:45.985 --> 00:14:48.087
But then he looks at me with those pretty sad

326
00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:51.824
puppy dog eyes and pulls me back in.

327
00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:54.260
We've been together since the eighth grade.

328
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.495
Maybe I'm co-dependent on him.

329
00:14:56.495 --> 00:15:00.733
Mario and Takia make the fast life look so easy.

330
00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.334
Fuck.

331
00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:06.872
I worked two weeks and my check is only $468?

332
00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:08.540
This ain't shit.

333
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.110
Sometimes life just ain't fear.

334
00:15:25.691 --> 00:15:27.660
- All right. what's wrong?

335
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.762
- Nothing's wrong. Jamal.

336
00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:33.065
- Come on Raven. why are you upset?

337
00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:34.233
I hope it ain't got nothing to do

338
00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:35.701
with me picking you up late.

339
00:15:35.701 --> 00:15:38.270
- [Raven VO] Mally you know damn well why I got an attitude.

340
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.974
(sighs) I wish I could just jump out this car right now.

341
00:15:41.974 --> 00:15:43.309
- You see. I picked my mom car up

342
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:46.712
just so I can get there to come and get you.

343
00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:48.580
- I'm not mad about that.

344
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.716
I'm mad because I wanna go shopping

345
00:15:50.716 --> 00:15:53.018
and with this little bullshit ass check

346
00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:55.854
I'm not gonna be able to buy much.

347
00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:01.627
- I should have $100 for you by Friday.

348
00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:04.296
I just don't see why you break your neck

349
00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.632
to buy that expensive high price shit anyway.

350
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:08.534
- Because that's what I like the wear. Jamal.

351
00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:10.002
- No. that's not what you like the wear.

352
00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:12.104
That's what your stuck up friends like the wear.

353
00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:13.505
- My friends aren't stuck up.

354
00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:15.007
We just like the best shit.

355
00:16:15.007 --> 00:16:16.275
What's wrong with that?

356
00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:18.110
- Look Raven. all I'm saying

357
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.113
is you don't need to buy all that expensive

358
00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:24.483

Get in. I'll take you home.

719
00:31:54.279 --> 00:31:55.146
- Nah. it's cool.

720
00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:57.048
But thanks though.

721
00:31:57.048 --> 00:31:58.716
- Come on. baby girl.

722
00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:00.251
It's late.

723
00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:03.788
You've been working all day. so your feet probably hurting.

724
00:32:03.788 --> 00:32:05.556
And I know you cold.

725
00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:16.167
You hungry?

726
00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:19.570
- [Raven VO] Should I be a little spontaneous?

727
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:24.208
I mean it's not like I planned a date or anything.

728
00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:26.277
But he is kind of adorable.

729
00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:27.312
No!

730
00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:28.613
Raven. just go home.

731
00:32:28.613 --> 00:32:29.814
- Nah. thanks. I'm cold.

732
00:32:29.814 --> 00:32:31.249
I already ate at work.

733
00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:34.986
Plus I gotta be up early for school tomorrow.

734
00:32:46.497 --> 00:32:50.034
- Look. I'm tired of playing with your pretty ass.

735
00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:51.669

- Look.

743
00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:11.122
Ain't nothing wrong with being a working man.

744
00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:12.490
I just work smart.

745
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.958
Not hard.

00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:16.027
And if you was my girl. you damn sure

747
00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:18.730

748
00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.333
- Thanks for the ride Nickels. but I gotta go.

749
00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:26.070

Take my number.

00:33:44.522 --> 00:33:46.024

813
00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:36.567
Stop!

814
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:40.538
First of all. y'all come in late.

815
00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:43.374
Then y'all not in the proper uniform.

816
00:35:43.374 --> 00:35:44.742
SWV.

817
00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:45.977
- [Students] SWV?

818
00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:47.445
- Yeah. sisters with no vehicles.

819
00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:48.546
Class. five minute break.

820
00:35:48.546 --> 00:35:49.947
Meet me in my office. let's go.

821
00:35:49.947 --> 00:35:51.349
Let's go ladies!

822
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:52.984
- Listen. I don't remember getting

823
00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:55.086
those uniforms at home room.

824
00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:56.020
Do y'all?

825
00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.388
- More like hoe uniforms.

826
00:35:57.388 --> 00:36:00.324
- Child please. did you see them shorts?

827
00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:03.194
It had to have been a yeast infection going on up in there.

828
00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:04.462
- Child. they walked up in here

829
00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:06.330
looking like a fake ass Toto.

830
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.598
Even Biggie can beat their

831
00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:09.667
bootleg style with his crooked-ass eye.

832
00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.270
(girls laughing)

833
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.437
- [Girls] RIP.

834
00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.082
- Raven. what was that about last night?

835
00:36:25.082 --> 00:36:27.351
My car broke down.

836
00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:28.953
I did everything I could to pick you up.

837
00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:31.222
but that shit was way out of my hands.

838
00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:32.690
I even borrowed my mom car just so I can

839
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:36.227
pick you up and take you to school today.

840
00:36:36.227 --> 00:36:38.095
Then I get to your job last night.

841
00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:39.330
You're not there.

842
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.566
Not answering your phone.

843
00:36:41.566 --> 00:36:42.800
What's going on. Rav?

844
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.035
'Cause lately you've been having this real

845
00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.903
stink ass attitude and I ain't feeling it.

846
00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:47.138
What's really the problem?

847
00:36:47.138 --> 00:36:50.374
- (sighs) Mally. I don't know how to say this.

848
00:36:50.374 --> 00:36:53.477
but we're just not working out no more.

849
00:36:53.477 --> 00:36:56.747
It's like we going in two different directions.

850
00:36:56.747 --> 00:36:59.417
- What. you breaking up with me?

851
00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:02.887
- I don't know. Mally!

852
00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:05.957
I don't know what I want anymore!

853
00:37:05.957 --> 00:37:06.791
Damn.

854
00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:10.361
- I can't believe this shit.

855
00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:13.130
After all the shit we've been through?

856
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.366
I don't even know who you are anymore.

857
00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:17.802
- Let me tell you who I am.

858
00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:20.037
I'm a girl growing up. and the boy I've been with

859
00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:23.774
since I was 14 is still in the same place.

860
00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:25.676
- I ain't trying to hear that shit.

861
00:37:25.676 --> 00:37:28.179
It's another nigga ain't it?

862
00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:30.715
Them girlfriends done got in your head.

863
00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:32.483
I knew it was them bitches.

864
00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:34.585
- Here we go again.

865
00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:35.987
I keep telling you my friends ain't got

866
00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:37.955
shit to do with how I'm feeling.

867
00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:39.857
I'm my own woman. and if you don't know that

868
00:37:39.857 --> 00:37:42.460
then I guess you don't know me.

869
00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.961
Matter of fact just pull over. Mally.

870
00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:46.130
I'mma just walk to school.

Why you ducking me?

887

but come on man. I think you punished me enough.

889

916
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.782

917
00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:46.016

918
00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:47.551

1018
00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.364

1019
00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:28.632

1020
00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:30.401
- Oh I remember now.

1021
00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:35.506
Nigga it's almost 1 o'clock in the morning.

1023
00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.242

1024
00:44:38.242 --> 00:44:40.477
- Oh that's what's up.

1025
00:44:40.477 --> 00:44:43.180
I hope you know I need compensation for my time.

1026
00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:46.350
- Yeah shorty. I know you about a couple dollars.

1027
00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:49.953
- All right. I'm at 5527 North Vine Street.

1028
00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:50.788
- All right.

1029
00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:52.389
Gimme about a half.

1030
00:44:53.557 --> 00:44:57.661
- [Takia VO] I'm a natural born hustler.

1031
00:44:57.661 --> 00:45:00.798
Street niggas is my game and I mastered it.

1032
00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:02.199
There ain't a crew of niggas

1033
00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:03.801
in Philadelphia that's getting money

1034
00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:07.538
that I don't know or dealt with directly.

1035
00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:10.207
Power and money is what turns me on.

1036
00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:12.109
If Raven and Mya knew half the shit

1037
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:15.779
I did for money. they would be so fucking shocked.

1038
00:45:15.779 --> 00:45:18.048
I tell my best friends enough.

1039
00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:20.984
But a girl gotta keep some secrets to herself.

1040
00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:23.987
When puberty hit. it hit me the right way.

1041
00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:26.156
My body got voluptuous and older guys

1042
00:45:26.156 --> 00:45:29.827
started to notice and spend lots of money on me.

1043
00:45:29.827 --> 00:45:33.897
The allure of crisp hundred dollars bills turns me on.

1044
00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:35.432
I've been reborn.

1045
00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:37.835
A fly. sexy. fast-talking bad bitch

1046
00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:39.470
that know how to talk to any nigga

1047
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:42.740
and make them part ways with they cash.

1048
00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.577
Look at Michelle. my mother.

1049
00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:48.312
Drunk again.

1050
00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:51.048
She been the greatest disappointment in my life.

1051
00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:54.651
Putting one abusive boyfriend after another in front of me.

1052
00:45:54.651 --> 00:45:57.121
My mother always been jealous of my beauty.

1053
00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:01.525
which I inherited from my handsome father Eugene Thomas.

1054
00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:03.660
All Michelle would tell me of him was that he was

1055
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.696
a no good son of a bitch that deserted us

1056
00:46:05.696 --> 00:46:08.732
and ran off for another woman.

1057
00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:11.568
My two older brothers had different fathers than me.

1058
00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:15.005
but they both adored they little sister.

1059
00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:17.474
And like most boys growing up in the hood.

1060
00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:19.943
they both turned to the streets and started hustling

1061
00:46:19.943 --> 00:46:23.247
for a local crew called West Philly Hustlers.

1062
00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:26.049
But I lost both of my brothers to the streets.

1063
00:46:26.049 --> 00:46:27.584
Now I'm just out here.

1064
00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:28.919

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:17.854
- Now where the hell you been?

1254
00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:20.123
Out whoring with one of your niggas?

1255
00:54:20.123 --> 00:54:22.759
- First of all. don't worry about where I've been.

1256
00:54:22.759 --> 00:54:24.327
Mind your damn business.

1257
00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:26.329
But if your nosy as must know.

1258
00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:28.131
I stayed the night at Mya's house.

1259
00:54:28.131 --> 00:54:29.633
- Alright Takia. don't forget your little

1260
00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:32.335
fast ass is still living up in my house!

1261
00:54:32.335 --> 00:54:35.538
- Last time I checked. this was my grandmother's house.

1262
00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:37.307
And the only reason bills get paid around here

1263
00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:40.410
is because of the money I bring in.

1264
00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:42.212
Look at this. Michelle.

1265
00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:43.580
You are trifling!

1266
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.148
It's stinking here.

1267
00:54:46.049 --> 00:54:48.218
- You swear you so hot.

1268
00:54:48.218 --> 00:54:49.452
'Cause you running around sleeping

1269
00:54:49.452 --> 00:54:51.254
with all these little drug dealers.

1270
00:54:51.254 --> 00:54:54.090
Sure. you're young and pretty.

1271
00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:56.226
But that ain't gonna last forever.

1272
00:54:56.226 --> 00:55:00.363
- Well as long as I got it. I'mma keep working it.

1273
00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:02.499
- You ain't nothing but a whore.

1274
00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:04.034
You ain't gonna be shit.

1275
00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:06.670
Just like your damn daddy wasn't shit.

1276
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:09.506
- I might be a whore. but I'm a paid whore.

1277
00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:12.108
As many men as I seen you bring inside this house.

1278
00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:14.277
your ass might wanna take some notes.

1279
00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:15.545
'Cause you've been broke ever since

1280
00:55:15.545 --> 00:55:18.782
grandma's life insurance money ran out.

1281
00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:26.556
- Well little miss paid whore.

1282
00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:28.158
the gas bill came in the mail.

1283
00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:30.160
We're five months behind.

1284
00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.228
They're gonna shut us off.

1285
00:55:32.228 --> 00:55:36.666
And since you're so paid. what you gonna do about it?

1286
00:55:37.734 --> 00:55:39.235
- Fucking figured.

1287
00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:53.416
And you better make sure it gets fucking paid.

1288
00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:01.891
I can't wait to move out of this

1289
00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:04.561
roach-infested rundown shed!

1290
00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:07.063
(tense music)

1291
00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:18.742
(hip hop music)

1292
00:56:28.017 --> 00:56:29.452
- Excuse me.

1293
00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:31.988
See. I'm having this problem.

1294
00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:34.190
I keep having this dream and in this dream

1295
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.192
there's a beautiful Goddess that walking.

1296
00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:38.795
The only thing is I can't see her face.

1297
00:56:38.795 --> 00:56:41.197
I'm thinking that might be you.

1298
00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:42.732
You need a ride home?

1299
00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:44.000
- No. I'm fine.

1300
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.435
It's Nadir right?

1301
00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:49.672
Oh. so that's what you look like in the daytime.

1302
00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:51.074
- You sure?

1303
00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:53.610
The passenger side could use some company.

1304
00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:55.044
Seeing how I gave you my number last time

1305
00:56:55.044 --> 00:56:56.513
and you never used it. right?

1306
00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:58.615
- I got a boyfriend. you remember him?

1307
00:56:58.615 --> 00:57:00.116
- Call it what you want.

1308
00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:03.086
I just wonder why we not friends.

1309
00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:03.920
- Nah. it's cool.

1310
00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.388
I got enough friends.

1311
00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:07.223
I keep a tight circle.

1312
00:57:09.893 --> 00:57:13.463
- I can guarantee ain't none of your friends like me.

1313
00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:15.432
Why don't you give me a try?

1314
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:17.834
- Nadir. I'm flattered.

1315
00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:19.302
And I think it's quite a coincidence

1316
00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:22.405
that we see each other twice in one week.

1317
00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:24.741
And as handsome as you are. I'm pretty sure

1318
00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:26.176
you got plenty of girls in your jacket.

1319
00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:30.013
- I got a few beds. but none of them like you.

1320
00:57:31.114 --> 00:57:33.116
You the star in my book.

1321
00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:39.022
I mean plus. the fly West Philly girl.

1322
00:57:40.523 --> 00:57:42.692
- And you from north. right?

1323
00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:44.194
- Nah.

1324
00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.361
From uptown.

1325
00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:47.197
That's where the flyest reside anyway.

1326
00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:48.431
- Cocky I see.

1327
00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:50.767
Typical light-skinned nigga.

1328
00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:52.969
You know what?

1329
00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:54.237
I think I gotta go.

1330
00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:55.371
It was nice seeing you though. Nadir.

1331
00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:56.773
- Whoa. pump the brakes. pump the brakes.

1332
00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:57.974
You got my number still?

1333
00:57:57.974 --> 00:57:59.476
- Yeah. I got it right here in tuck.

1334
00:57:59.476 --> 00:58:01.611
- Take me out the tuck.

1335
00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:03.446
Give me a call sometime.

1336
00:58:03.446 --> 00:58:05.615
I'm always here with my friends.

1337
00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:07.450
- I'll think about it.

1338
00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:20.697
(hip hop music)

1339
00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.472
- You know Takia. everyone wants a shot.

1340
00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:03.806
I know you tired of being out here

1341
00:59:03.806 --> 00:59:05.642
in these streets like that. shorty.

1342
00:59:05.642 --> 00:59:06.876
It's funny as shit 'cause if you wasn't

1343
00:59:06.876 --> 00:59:08.778
with my man Malik Moses. I really would've been

1344
00:59:08.778 --> 00:59:10.513
trying to take you personally right now.

1345
00:59:10.513 --> 00:59:11.781
- [Takia] Fuck out of here. Rock.

1346
00:59:11.781 --> 00:59:13.583
No one's introducing me to shit sexually

1347
00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.752
that my young ass didn't know nothing about.

1348
00:59:15.752 --> 00:59:20.590
- You went from little Takia to thick Takia fast as shit.

1349
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:22.392
Your brother. he rather you fucking

1350
00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:24.360
with a real nigga like me than fuck with

1351
00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.195
all these lame niggas you fucking with.

1352
00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:27.030
- [Takia] Lames?

1353
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:27.964
You got me fucked up.

1354
00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:31.334
Imagine me fucking with a lame.

1355
00:59:31.334 --> 00:59:34.003
(phone ringing)

1356
00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:36.639
Who this?

1357
00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:39.175
- What's real. Takia?

1358
00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:41.544
Goddamn. you got two niggas on your phone.

1359
00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:43.813
You don't recognize my voice?

1360
00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:47.150
- Oh my God. Lil Rell from South Philly?

1361
00:59:48.484 --> 00:59:49.352
Where you at?

1362
00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:50.987
It's so loud.

1363
00:59:50.987 --> 00:59:52.722
Oh. a crap game?

1364
00:59:52.722 --> 00:59:55.291
- Yeah. I'm gonna smack these niggas real quick.

1365
00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:56.926
Just came up on a couple dollars.

1366
00:59:56.926 --> 00:59:59.028
I'm saying though. trying to see you later on.

1367
00:59:59.028 --> 01:00:00.296
What you doing?

1368
01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:02.165
- Nothing.

1369
01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:04.567
I'm free as a bird.

1370
01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:07.370
- Around 11 I'll probably come pick you up.

1371
01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.771
All right.

1372
01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.840
All right. that's cool.

1373
01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.010
(gamblers chattering)

1374
01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:18.381
(phone ringing)

1375
01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:22.585
- Hello?

1376
01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:24.520
You outside?

1377
01:00:25.421 --> 01:00:27.857
I'm coming right now.

1378
01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:29.359
All right.

1379
01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.861
- [Takia VO] Lil Rell from South Philly?

1380
01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:33.763
Where do I even start?

1381
01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:35.098
I'm used to being with guys

1382
01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:37.600
and being able to control my emotions.

1383
01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.302
Thinking like a man. but damn sure

1384
01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.037
still looking like a lady.

1385
01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:43.006
But when it comes to Rell.

1386
01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:45.608
he kind of makes my heart skip a beat.

1387
01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:48.378
His sleepy eyes and his sexy smile

1388
01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:50.413
kind of remind me of Nas.

1389
01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:53.750
And his body is toned.

1390
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.285
He's gotta be doing 100 push-ups a day.

1391
01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:58.421
And when we get it in. it's not just

1392
01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:00.423
about the cash when I'm with Rell.

1393
01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:02.525
And having feelings for niggas goes against

1394
01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:04.894
everything in my hustler's handbook.

1395
01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:08.731
- Rell. your fine ass is gonna get it tonight.

1396
01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:15.872
(romantic piano music)

1397
01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:27.016
(car revs)

1398
01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:37.293
- So what's the deal. shorty?

1399
01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:38.394
- I've been chilling.

1400
01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:39.495
Just going to school.

1401
01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:41.698
(Rell chuckles)

1402
01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.032
- The fuck out of there.

1403
01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:45.334
I know you be out here in these streets.

1404
01:01:45.334 --> 01:01:46.836
- Rell. come on.

1405
01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:50.373
I got a few friends. but ain't no ring on my finger.

1406
01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.308
- Stop juggling so many niggas.

1407
01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:55.111
I might put a rock on that finger.

1408
01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.983
Yeah. I knew that would shut your ass up.

1409
01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.287
For real.

1410
01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:07.790
I mean. maybe. would you wanna be my girl?

1411
01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:10.026
- Really?

1412
01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.062
You don't understand.

1413
01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:15.198
It's hard for me to trust men.

1414
01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:17.667
I don't think I'm the wifey type.

1415
01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:19.869
- Why you say that. Takia?

1416
01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.537
You're gorgeous.

1417
01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:24.340
You always got the fly shit on.

1418
01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:25.508
You a hustler.

1419
01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:28.411
In the bedroom.

1420
01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:32.248
You already know what it is.

1421
01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:41.023
Look Takia. I wanna be with you.

1422
01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:43.259
Despite your past.

1423
01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:44.594
You ain't gotta be out here hopping

1424
01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.829
from nigga to nigga like that.

1425
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:51.200
Just imagine how your life could be with just me.

1426
01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.035
- You sure you want me?

1427
01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:56.606
You gonna hear all kind of rumors about me.

1428
01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:03.079

It was like the nigga was possessed.

1500
01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.031
- That's crazy.

1501
01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.466

1502
01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:52.835

She too fucking old to be this petty.

Ain't she going on 30?

Girl. you messing with a boss man.

1538
01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:19.054
One of the top niggas in the city.

1539
01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:22.925
Haters and jealousy come with the territory.

1540
01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:26.929
Chicks that never knew your name are now seeking you out.

1541
01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:30.933
They all wanna know who's Carmello Black's girl.

How could I ever sweat these bitches?

1546

1547
01:09:46.882 --> 01:09:49.952
Let me check these haters real quick.

1548
01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:56.025

By the way. you looking good as a motherfucker today. baby.

1559
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.896
- Tyrel. cut the bullshit.

1560
01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:36.165
I get enough commentary from the big bosses

1561
01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:38.400
in Jersey and in New York.

1562
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.002
Let's get down to business.

1563
01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:41.237
What's the deal with this RaQuan kid

1564
01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:42.571
that you brought to the table?

1565
01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.006
- Yeah. he's like my brother.

1566
01:10:44.006 --> 01:10:45.574
He can be trusted.

1567
01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:48.510
His folks got Chester and half of Delaware on lock.

1568
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:51.814
I feel like it'll be a good way to spread territory.

1569
01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:55.084
- In the meeting we had. he's asking for a lot of product.

1570
01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.352
You know normally I don't do them

1571
01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:58.420
kind of numbers with no cash exchange.

1572
01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.623
- No I know. I know. but he's serious about his money.

1573
01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.224
He gonna flip them kis quick.

1574
01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:03.692
He gonna bring you back the return.

1575
01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:05.261
Shit. with triple interest.

1576
01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:07.029
- So you vouching for this kid?

1577
01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:09.598
- Yo. you got my word. LaDonna.

1578
01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:12.668
- All right. RaQuan's in.

1579
01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:15.971
Delaware and Chester. new Daluca territory.

1580
01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:19.141
I like the sound that those benjamins.

1581
01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:25.581
Tyrel.

1582
01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:31.353
Make sure everything runs smooth with RaQuan.

1583
01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:33.722
Because if he fucks this up. someone's head's

1584
01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:36.592
gonna roll one way or the other.

1585
01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:37.960

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.511
Let me get my shit together. man.

1607
01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.446
I'll be right out there.

1608
01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:31.280
- All right.

1609
01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.281
- All right.

1610
01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:37.353
Yo man. get your shit together. man.

1611
01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.153
Come on. you out.

1612
01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:38.987
Bounce.

1613
01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:50.766
What's up bro. how are you?

1614
01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:51.734
- I'm good.

1615
01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:53.402
What's up with the young bulls?

1616
01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:55.604
- Hey man. I don't play no games with them niggas.

1617
01:12:55.604 --> 01:12:57.506
- Yeah. I know.

1618
01:12:57.506 --> 01:12:59.141
- Yeah man. I had to straighten

1619
01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:01.210
(indistinct) a couple weeks ago.

1620
01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.478
- Nah. I don't doubt it.

1621
01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:04.279
You my gunner.

1622
01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:05.481
And that's why I'm here.

1623
01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:07.116
That's what I need to talk to you about.

1624
01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:09.685
But listen. what we talk about right now?

1625
01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:12.654
This shit gotta stay between us.

1626
01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:13.789
- Hey Black.

1627
01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.057
Come on. man.

1628
01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:16.158
Who are you talking to. man?

1629
01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.359
Tell me what's on your mind.

1630
01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.193
What's up?

1631
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:25.067
- I got some information that came to my attention.

1632
01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.336
Make a long story short. one day I might

1633
01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:31.006
need you to eliminate somebody in your own crew.

1634
01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:32.307
- [Khalid] Who?

1635
01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:33.142
- Faheem.

1636
01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:36.645
I mean I can't trust him no more.

1637
01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:39.047
I mean this machine.

1638
01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:40.382
We got a machine going.

1639
01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:41.850
And this shit rolling.

1640
01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:44.086
He might have to just get rolled over.

1641
01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.988
I mean I don't want to.

1642
01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.923
But I don't got no choice.

1643
01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.858
It's business.

1644
01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:52.861
He might bring the whole thing down.

1645
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:56.865
'Cause you the only nigga that he trusts.

1646
01:13:56.865 --> 01:13:59.134
To let get close enough.

1647
01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:01.570
And on top of that. outside of myself

1648
01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:04.006
you the only nigga with enough heart to look

1649
01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:08.243
a nigga in his eyes before you blow his head off.

1650
01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.012
So can you handle it?

1651
01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:13.315
- I mean...

1652
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:15.951
Fah?

1653
01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:16.885
- Fah.

1654
01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:17.953
- Black. it's Fah. Black.

1655
01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:19.488
- I know.

1656
01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:20.589
- Nigga like family.

1657
01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:21.423
- Yeah.

1658
01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:27.729
I mean. but what you done to my life. man?

1659
01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.898
What you done for me. man?

1660
01:14:30.933 --> 01:14:33.101
I'm forever grateful.

1661
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:36.638
But I mean if that's really how you feel.

1662
01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:39.975
and that's really what you want to get done.

1663
01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:43.045
then just give me the word and I'mma do him.

1664
01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:44.580
Fuck him.

1665
01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:46.882
I mean it's not like I could say no to you anyway. nigga.

1666
01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:49.585
You've been big bro since I was like 14. 15.

1667
01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:51.653
- Nigga you was 14 when you got down with me.

1668
01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:52.588
- Damn.

1669
01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:54.656
Damn. you right. I was 14.

1670
01:14:58.126 --> 01:14:59.728
- Can you handle it?

1671
01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:00.529
- Yeah.

1672
01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:08.937
- I'll hit you up and give you the word when I'm ready.

1673
01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:11.039
- Make sure you do that.

1674
01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:12.174
Be safe out here. man.

1675
01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.008
- You too. man.

1676
01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:13.842
- Love you. OG.

1677
01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.110
- Love you too.

1678
01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:27.155
(car revs)

1679
01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:33.929
- What the hell do you mean you're leaving?

1680
01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:35.430
- [Takia] Like I just said.

1681
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.699
Rell and I are moving in together.

1682
01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:40.369
I'm sick of putting up with your shit.

1683
01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.437
And living in this filth.

1684
01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:46.808
- If you think that that nigga really loves you.

1685
01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:50.045
then you're dumber than what I thought.

1686
01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:52.214
He's just gonna get where he can from you

1687
01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:54.349
and throw you to the side like trash.

1688
01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:55.817
- Yeah. whatever.

1689
01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:58.687
I thought I'd let you know that I was leaving.

1690
01:15:58.687 --> 01:16:00.656
I can't stay in this house and be miserable

1691
01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:03.492
with you for any second longer.

1692
01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:05.694
And just because you ain't never had a man in your life

1693
01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:08.830
that loved you don't mean mine ain't gonna be different.

1694
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:10.999
I know for a fact Rell loves me.

1695
01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.367
- Girl please.

1696
01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:14.136
You don't know love.

1697
01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:15.370
The same way you don't know

1698
01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:18.640
your coochie from a hole in the wall.

1699
01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.342
But you wanna leave so bad?

1700
01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:21.677
Then go.

1701
01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:23.111
But you ain't gonna be banging on

1702
01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:25.380
my door with no crying babies.

1703
01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.716
I'm done raising children.

1704
01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:29.017
- Michelle. please.

1705
01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:31.219
You ain't never raised no children.

1706
01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:32.921
My grandma raised us.

1707
01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.523
All you did was push us out.

1708
01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.557
- You little bitch. I should've

1709
01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:37.326
aborted you like I started to.

1710
01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:38.360
- Fuck you!

1711
01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.661
You drunk bitch!

1712
01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:41.296
It should've been you in the early grave!

1713
01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:44.066
Not my brother or my grandmother!

1714
01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:54.076
Don't touch my stuff. Michelle.

1715
01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.979
- Take your shit and get the hell out of my house!

1716
01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:58.213
- Don't throw my-

1717
01:16:58.213 --> 01:16:59.481
- And don't come crawling back here

1718
01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:01.149
when that nigga kicks your ass to the curb!

1719
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:04.453
These niggas don't know what love is!

1720
01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:06.688
- Did you forget that I took care of you?

1721
01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:08.624
You've never taken care of me.

1722
01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:10.826
The reason why bills get paid around this bitch.

1723
01:17:10.826 --> 01:17:12.961
and there's food in the fridge. is because of me!

1724
01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:16.898
And I never once got a thank you from your sorry ass!

1725
01:17:16.898 --> 01:17:18.467
But you know what?

1726
01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:21.603
You gonna need me before I ever need your broke ass.

1727
01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:23.705
You've always been jealous of me.

1728
01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:25.407
And when I do become a mother.

1729
01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:28.644
I already know what not to do from you.

1730
01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:32.147
- These niggas don't know what love is!

1731
01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:34.583
All they love is fast money

1732
01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:37.285
and easy little whores like you!

1733
01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:40.155
He's gonna use you up and spit you out!

1734
01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:41.423
You just watch!

1735
01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:45.694
He's gonna break you!

1736
01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:47.529
Do you hear me. Takia?

1737
01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:50.899
- I'm already broken.

1738
01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:56.972
- Fuck this.

1739
01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.541
Yo. come on. babe.

1740
01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.043
We out.

1741
01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:03.345
You ain't gotta put up with this bullshit no more. yo.

1742
01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:04.513
Come on.

1743
01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:07.149
- You ain't nothing special!

1744
01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:11.420
And you ain't gonna have no fairy tale ending either!

1745
01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.854
I used to be you!

1746
01:18:14.423 --> 01:18:16.224
Just take a look around!

1747
01:18:16.224 --> 01:18:18.660
You're gonna be just like me!

1748
01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.835
(car revs)

1749
01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.504
- You all right?

1750
01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:35.577
It's gonna be cool. baby.

1751
01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:43.051
- And what the hell all y'all looking at?

1752
01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:46.755
Can't none of y'all on this block judge me!

1753
01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.957
Melba. you ain't nothing but a drunk!

1754
01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:51.359
Sitting on welfare just like me!

1755
01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:53.128
- Fuck you. Michelle.

1756
01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:54.062
Fuck you.

1757
01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:55.464
- Shut up. you old drunk broad!

1758
01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:58.166
And Ms. Francine. your grandson been selling

1759
01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:59.968
drugs out your house for years.

1760
01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:01.169
- You know what?

1761
01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:02.971
What goes on at my house is my business.

1762
01:19:02.971 --> 01:19:05.941
You need to take care of your own household.

1763
01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:08.009
- And you. Ms. Thelma.

1764
01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:10.879
So high and mighty. holy church lady.

1765
01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:14.583
But always gossiping about everybody up and down this block.

1766
01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.752
Your granddaughters are hoes.

1767
01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:18.086
Just like Takia.

1768
01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:21.423
Sleeping with all them boys from 60th Street.

1769
01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.525
I know all about it.

1770
01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:25.460
- My granddaughters ain't no hoes.

1771
01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.562
They're both in nursing school.

1772
01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:29.931
My granddaughters are good girls.

1773
01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:32.934
- Nursing school my ass. Ms. Thelma.

1774
01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:36.171
They nursing them dicks over on 60th Street.

1775
01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:38.006
That's what they good at.

1776
01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:39.341
- You know what?

1777
01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:42.043
I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.

1778
01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:43.979
If I wasn't a good Christian woman.

1779
01:19:43.979 --> 01:19:47.616
I'd be hopping this porch. whooping your ass!

1780
01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:48.917
But you know what?

1781
01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:50.685
I'm just gonna pray for you.

1782
01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:51.853
You need help.

1783
01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:55.223
Michelle. you need to cut this stuff out!

1784
01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:57.292
Lord Jesus. help this lost soul.

1785
01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.561
I ain't got time for this nonsense.

1786
01:19:59.561 --> 01:20:03.965
I got a fresh pot of collard greens on the stove.

1787
01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.735
(dramatic music)

1788
01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:18.480
- You'll be back. Takia.

1794
01:21:49.604 --> 01:21:50.472
- Yo Takia!

1795
01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:52.707
Hey Takia!

1796
01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:54.009
(Pumpkin honks)

1797
01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:55.410
Damn. you don't hear me calling you?

1798
01:21:55.410 --> 01:21:57.245
- Oh my God. what Pumpkin?

1799
01:21:57.245 --> 01:21:58.980
- I call your phone. you never answer.

1800
01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.215
I go past your mom's crib.

1801
01:22:00.215 --> 01:22:01.616
she said you ain't there no more.

1802
01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:04.085
- Pumpkin. what we we had going on is over.

1803
01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:05.620
I'm in a serious relationship.

1804
01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:06.821
I have a boyfriend.

1805
01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.023
- Boyfriend?

1806
01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:08.957
Who. that little South Philly nigga?

1807
01:22:08.957 --> 01:22:10.191
- Yes. Rell from South Philly.

1808
01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:12.127
- That young bull's a fucking sucker.

1809
01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:13.995
Listen. I know we ain't go together. but damn.

1810
01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:16.097
I thought we had something special going on.

1811
01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:18.600
All that cash I got your broke ass.

1812
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.535
- Pumpkin. we had an arrangement.

1813
01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:22.904
but as of now that shit over.

1814
01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:24.105
- Know what. Takia?

1815
01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:26.007
Fuck you then. bitch!

1816
01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:26.942
- Fuck you!

1817
01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.476
With your corny little dick ass.

1818
01:22:28.476 --> 01:22:30.612
- I got tired of fucking with your stank ass anyway.

1819
01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:32.047
Back the fuck up from my car!

1820
01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:33.882
Don't get. hey yo get the fuck off!

1821
01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:35.617
Go get fucked up!

1822
01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:36.818
- These are so cute.

1823
01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:37.752
- Yes.

1824
01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:38.687
- I got those in my closet.

1825
01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:39.521
- You got these?

1826
01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:40.755
- Of course.

1827
01:22:40.755 --> 01:22:42.390
- [Raven] I ain't see them in your closet.

1828
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.258
- [Mya] Takia.

1829
01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:44.626
- [Raven] Yes.

1830
01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:46.094
- Takia why you so quiet over there?

1831
01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:47.062
What's up with you?

1832
01:22:47.062 --> 01:22:47.896
- Nothing.

1833
01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:48.730
I'm cool.

1834
01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:52.801
- Anyway. this will look so cute on you

1835
01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:56.104
and I know Rell will appreciate it.

1836
01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:58.540
- I can't believe y'all moved in with each other.

1837
01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.909
Things must be getting pretty serious.

1838
01:23:00.909 --> 01:23:03.411
- More serious than you think.

1839
01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:06.781
- Let me see.

1840
01:23:06.781 --> 01:23:07.782
- What is it?

1841
01:23:07.782 --> 01:23:09.150
- Oh my God. it's positive.

1842
01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:10.485
Yo Takia. you really knocked up.

1843
01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:11.319
- Takia.

1844
01:23:12.354 --> 01:23:14.189
So what is you gonna do?

1845
01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:15.323
- I don't know.

1846
01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:17.225
I'm debating with myself.

1847
01:23:17.225 --> 01:23:19.928
I mean. am I ready for a baby?

1848
01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.997
Is Rell ready for a baby?

1849
01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:25.033
Is he gonna break up with me?

1850
01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:25.967
I don't know.

1851
01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:27.202
- Look. if you want me to go to

1852
01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:28.770
Planned Parenthood with you I will.

1853
01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:30.338
You're only. what. a few weeks?

1854
01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:33.308
All you need is $400. a fake ID.

1855
01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:34.409
Just tell Rell to give you the money

1856
01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:35.910
for shopping or something.

1857
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:38.580
But you know what it's really for.

1858
01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.215
Why y'all looking at me like that?

1859
01:23:40.215 --> 01:23:42.017
That's what my cousin Regina told me her friend Tia did

1860
01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:46.087
when she was knocked up and didn't wanna keep it.

1861
01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:48.423
- Bitch. sometimes I wonder about you.

1862
01:23:48.423 --> 01:23:49.657
- Yes. child.

1863
01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:51.726
- So Rell doesn't know yet?

1864
01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:52.727
- No.

1865
01:23:52.727 --> 01:23:54.596
I'm not killing my baby.

1866
01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:56.164
I mean if Rell really love me.

1867
01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:59.234
he'll do the right thing and stick by my side.

1868
01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:01.336
I think Rell would be a good dad.

1869
01:24:01.336 --> 01:24:03.938
He's so good with his nieces and nephews.

1870
01:24:03.938 --> 01:24:06.441
- Takia. you is tripping.

1871
01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:08.443
You out of all females should know that dating

1872
01:24:08.443 --> 01:24:11.980
a street nigga is one thing. but having a baby by him?

1873
01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.748
That's something different.

1874
01:24:13.748 --> 01:24:15.383
Nothing is guaranteed.

1875
01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:16.651
- Raven. what would you know what

1876
01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:18.486
dating the street guy is like?

1877
01:24:18.486 --> 01:24:19.921
You just started messing with one

1878
01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:21.756
for the first time a week ago.

1879
01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:23.458
- I learn the game quick.

1880
01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:26.561
- Girl. you the last person I need advice from about men.

1881
01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:29.164
- Look. before you two hoes start going in on each other.

1882
01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:31.566
Puff Daddy & The Family concert tickets go on sale

1883
01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:34.602
this Friday and we need to be in the building.

1884
01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:35.937
- They going on sale?

1885
01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:37.338
Oh we in the building!

1886
01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:39.474
- What are we gonna wear is the question.

1887
01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:40.542
- What you mean?

1888
01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.143
We coming through in fur.

1889
01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:45.647
Mink and fox coats like real bad bitches.

1890
01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:48.283
And I'm charging the tickets to my mom's American Express.

1891
01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:50.051
We guaranteed at least fifth row.

1892
01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.252
- Yes.

1893
01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:52.253
We in there.

1894
01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:57.792
- Rell.

1895
01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:00.428
- You up?

1896
01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:03.865
- No.

1897
01:25:04.999 --> 01:25:07.435
- I gotta tell you something.

1898
01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:12.407
- What's up?

1899
01:25:14.309 --> 01:25:15.577
- I'm pregnant.

1900
01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:24.686
Rell. I didn't do it on purpose to trap you.

1901
01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:26.855
Please don't be mad at me.

1902
01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:29.824
- Mad at you?

1903
01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:33.161
You having a baby.

1904
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:35.864
Something we created out of love.

1905
01:25:35.864 --> 01:25:37.432
Why would I be mad at you?

1906
01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:39.834
- I didn't know how you would feel.

1907
01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:42.537
I want this baby so bad.

1908
01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:44.606
- You gonna have him too.

1909
01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.708
I'll be with you every step the way.

1910
01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:48.343
I'm ready to be a father.

1911
01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:49.277
- Him?

1912
01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:51.312
How you know it's not a her?

1913
01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:53.581
- I mean we only make boys in our family.

1914
01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:55.083
It gotta be a him.

1915
01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:59.454
- Well that might change today. baby.

1916
01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.802
- No Frankie. you gotta tell LaDonna

1917
01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:17.906
to give me a little more time than that. yo.

1918
01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:20.008
Man. 200.000 ain't no fucking trump change!

1919
01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:22.443
Man you know that shit!

1920
01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:23.978
Huh?

1921
01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:26.014
Yo. I thought RaQuan was stable. dawg.

1922
01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:28.149
- That isn't my fucking problem.

1923
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:30.752
You vouched for that cocksucker motherfucker!

1924
01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:32.320
His debt is your debt.

1925
01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.388
- Dawg. I ain't know he was gonna

1926
01:26:33.388 --> 01:26:35.056
fuck up them bricks like that.

1927
01:26:35.056 --> 01:26:36.191
- You're the one that brought that kid

1928
01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:37.959
around here in the first place.

1929
01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:39.761
So you need to pay up!

1930
01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:41.596
And I don't care where you get it from!

1931
01:26:41.596 --> 01:26:44.032
You can get it from your ass for all I care!

1932
01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.099
- [LaDonna] Give me the fucking phone.

1933
01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:46.634
- Here.

1934
01:26:46.634 --> 01:26:49.404
- You listen to me Rell. you moolie piece of shit.

1935
01:26:49.404 --> 01:26:50.905
I'm tired of the excuses.

1936
01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:52.941
- No. I understand business is business.

1937
01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:54.442
- I'm tired of hearing it.

1938
01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:56.511
I want every dime of that 200.000 that you owe me

1939
01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:57.912
or I'm gonna have your black ass

1940
01:26:57.912 --> 01:27:00.215
chopped up into little pieces all up and down

1941
01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:02.417
on Fifth Street in front of your grandma Penny's house.

1942
01:27:02.417 --> 01:27:03.284
You understand?

1943
01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:04.219
- 200.000?

1944
01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.055
No. right now I got like 40.

1945
01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:08.122
I feel like if you...

1946
01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:09.290
Hello?

1947
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:10.124
Hello?

1948
01:27:13.461 --> 01:27:14.729
Fuck!

1949
01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:17.232
(tense music)

1950
01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:21.502
- Bring him over.

1951
01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:27.542
RaQuan. so good of you to join us.

1952
01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:29.544
- Yo. what's up LaDonna?

1953
01:27:30.712 --> 01:27:31.946
- Got something for you.

1954
01:27:31.946 --> 01:27:35.416
A little token of my appreciation.

1955
01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:37.719
Don't spend it all on loose women and fried chicken.

1956
01:27:37.719 --> 01:27:40.054
- Hey RaQuan. your friend Tyrel?

1957
01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.589
Consider him done.

1958
01:27:41.589 --> 01:27:42.890
- You know my name in these streets?

1959
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:44.158
RaQuan.

1960
01:27:44.158 --> 01:27:45.593
He was getting too big headed anyway.

1961
01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:46.427
Fuck him.

1962
01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:50.131
- Consider that checkmate?

1963
01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:51.532
- Yeah I did.

1964
01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:55.303
And the queen's always left standing.

1965
01:27:55.303 --> 01:27:58.873
- Rell. what the fuck is going on?

1966
01:27:58.873 --> 01:27:59.907
- Ain't nothing going on.

1967
01:27:59.907 --> 01:28:01.409
I thought you was asleep.

1968
01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:03.478
The fuck. you eavesdropping on my phone conversations now?

1969
01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:06.114
- You woke me up with your loud yelling and screaming.

1970
01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:08.016
I heard half of your conversation.

1971
01:28:08.016 --> 01:28:10.351
Now tell me what's going on.

1972
01:28:12.587 --> 01:28:14.889
- I'm sorry baby. come here.

1973
01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:22.964
I'm in some deep shit right now. T.

1974
01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:30.605
Ain't no man.

1975
01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:36.444
Just some fucking dickhead I thought was my man.

1976
01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:39.447
This nigga RaQuan from Fifth Street.

1977
01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:43.384
I put him in with my coke connection.

1978
01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:44.752
Time when my niggas and I were dealing

1979
01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:47.889
for a couple years out of South Philly.

1980
01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:50.758
They put a lot of work on him.

1981
01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:53.795
Just off the strength of me.

1982
01:28:53.795 --> 01:28:55.830
Now this motherfucker ran off somewhere.

1983
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:57.198
Nobody know where the fuck he is.

1984
01:28:57.198 --> 01:28:59.634
Nobody get him on the line. nobody seen him.

1985
01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:01.703
And they looking at me to pay their debt.

1986
01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:04.038
- Babe. it's not your fault.

1987
01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.841
- You don't get it. T.

1988
01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:12.647
Them?

1989
01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:13.915
They on some...

1990
01:29:16.317 --> 01:29:18.686
Some family respect shit.

1991
01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:21.356
And it's like they feel like by me

1992
01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:24.659
bringing that nigga to the table.

1993
01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:27.528
I might have something to do with it.

1994
01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:31.699
So now they just straight pinning that shit on me.

1995
01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:37.739
They told me that I have to pay them $200.000 by Friday.

1996
01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:41.542
Or some more shit might...

1997
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:44.045
- Or what?

1998
01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:45.713
They gonna kill you?

1999
01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:49.283
- It's a real possibility. T.

2000
01:29:49.283 --> 01:29:50.618
Takia come here!

2001
01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:56.591
- All these clothes. all this jewelry. sell all this shit!

2002
01:29:56.591 --> 01:29:57.425
All of it!

2003
01:29:57.425 --> 01:29:58.359
- Listen to me.

2004
01:29:58.359 --> 01:30:00.294
I got this. let me handle this.

2005
01:30:00.294 --> 01:30:02.930
We ain't gotta sell shit!

2006
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:04.399
Fuck. man.

2007
01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:08.002
I wanted to keep all this shit from you. T.

2008
01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:14.175
Listen to me.

2009
01:30:14.175 --> 01:30:16.978
You can't tell nobody about this.

2010
01:30:16.978 --> 01:30:18.312
Not your friends. nobody.

2011
01:30:18.312 --> 01:30:20.148
I got this. all right?

2012
01:30:26.654 --> 01:30:28.489

Let's talk.

2075
01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:53.060

- I mean you gonna use him as an East Coast distributor?

2078
01:33:55.863 --> 01:33:57.164
I keep hearing whispers in the streets

2079
01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:58.566
about you have meetings with the connect

2080
01:33:58.566 --> 01:33:59.867
and I'm not invited to none of this shit.

2081
01:33:59.867 --> 01:34:01.268
- Wait. wait. wait wait wait.

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:02.203
Listen.

2083
01:34:02.203 --> 01:34:03.437

2084
01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:04.372
- Listen. don't worry about that.

2085
01:34:04.372 --> 01:34:05.339
I'm glad you brought it up.

2086
01:34:05.339 --> 01:34:06.641
I've been thinking and I'm gonna

2087
01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.342
go in a different direction.

2088
01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:09.543
But don't worry about it.

2089
01:34:09.543 --> 01:34:10.578
Just continue what you was doing.

2090
01:34:10.578 --> 01:34:11.512
I got it.

2091
01:34:11.512 --> 01:34:12.413

- Yeah.

2093
01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:14.849
- Since when you start making decisions

2094
01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:17.652
without discussing it with me first?

2095
01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:18.853

Faheem. fuck's you talking about?

2105
01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:33.534
- No it hasn't.

2106
01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:36.237
Listen. I don't wanna go there with you.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.941
I don't want you ever questioning me

2110

You can't do what I do. Fah!

2134
01:35:18.112 --> 01:35:20.681
You can never be Carmello Black!

2135
01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:21.649
- Nigga it's me.

2136
01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:22.983
- I know who the fuck you are.

2137
01:35:22.983 --> 01:35:24.485
- Faheem.

2138
01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:26.353
The same nigga that was with you getting rolled on

2139
01:35:26.353 --> 01:35:29.023
by 10 niggas at Strawberry Mansion.

2140
01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:30.424
Okay?

2141
01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:32.827

01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:35.162
I was busting my gat. nigga!

2143
01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:38.032
We pull out shit.

2144
01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:42.870
This is what you gonna do to me. nigga?

2145
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:43.704
Hmm?

2147
01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:50.244
(tense music)

2148
01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:53.514
Even though you threatening my life.

2149
01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:55.316
I'm always gonna love you. man.

2150
01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:59.920
Like the brother that my mother never birthed.

2151
01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.288
- I love you too.

2152
01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:05.726
- [Faheem VO] Special Agent Johnson.

2153
01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:08.262
I got the info on Carmello Black.

2154
01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:10.831
I know when and where he's at with enough coke

2155
01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:14.101
that you can sit his ass down for a fucking lifetime.

2156
01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:16.504
This man's orchestrated bodies over the past 10 years.

2157
01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:19.073
He got bodies all over Philly and Delaware!

2158
01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:19.907
Yes!

2159
01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:22.576
All right.

2160
01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:28.749
- [DeMarcos] Winters!

2161
01:36:28.749 --> 01:36:30.251
- What's up?

2162
01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:32.253
- You won't believe the anonymous tip I just got.

2163
01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:33.754
- Oh yeah?

2164
01:36:33.754 --> 01:36:34.555
- You know that big fish we've been trying to bait?

2165
01:36:34.555 --> 01:36:35.856
- Carmello Black!

2166
01:36:35.856 --> 01:36:36.924
- Yeah. that's the one.

2167
01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:38.192
- Okay.

2168
01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:39.960
- I got everything we need to hook his ass.

2169
01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.529
- Well let's go fishing.

2170
01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:42.363

2171
01:36:46.066 --> 01:36:48.736
(hip hop music)

2172
01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:23.237
(Mya laughs)

2173
01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:24.905
- Yo.

2174
01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:30.744
You know I would never put you in danger right?

2175
01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:33.848
- Yeah.

2176
01:37:33.848 --> 01:37:36.550
- The only reason I ask is 'cause.

2177
01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:46.093
It's like I need you to take this run with me.

2178
01:37:46.093 --> 01:37:47.628
- Take a run with you?

2179
01:37:47.628 --> 01:37:48.462
- Yeah.

2180
01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:52.933
My last run.

2181
01:37:52.933 --> 01:37:54.268
A big run.

2182
01:37:54.268 --> 01:37:55.970
Life-changing run.

2183
01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:58.138
And as far as I'm concerned right now.

2184
01:37:58.138 --> 01:38:00.074
you the only person that I trust.

2185
01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:01.008
- Oh really?

2186
01:38:01.008 --> 01:38:02.343
- No. seriously.

2187
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:06.480
I'm ready to go legit after this.

2188
01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:08.983
Go get me a crib somewhere in Jersey or something.

2189
01:38:08.983 --> 01:38:10.150
You know what I'm saying?

2190
01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:11.318
I'm aware that your pop got paper.

2191
01:38:11.318 --> 01:38:12.553
I know.

2192
01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:14.088
But I wanna be the one to take care of you.

2193
01:38:14.088 --> 01:38:16.924
I wanna be the one to pay for your college tuition.

2194
01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:18.392
And on top of that. I want to be the one

2195
01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:20.861
to put a ring on your finger and lock you down.

2196
01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:22.129
- You wanna marry me. Black?

2197
01:38:22.129 --> 01:38:23.030
Wife me up. huh?

2198
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:24.465
- For sure.

2199
01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:26.634
What you think I've been moving you for all this time?

2200
01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:28.168
You my Bonnie!

2201
01:38:28.168 --> 01:38:31.238
- I mean you definitely my Clyde.

2202
01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:33.007
- Meet my folks.

2203
01:38:33.007 --> 01:38:34.708
Probably gonna meet us at the port.

2204
01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:36.443
Fill us up with enough white to paint

2205
01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:38.712
the whole city white as a Christmas Day.

2206
01:38:38.712 --> 01:38:39.647
- I mean...

2207
01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:43.217
I don't know. Black knight.

2208
01:38:43.217 --> 01:38:44.285
- What's wrong?

2209
01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:45.619
- What if something goes wrong?

2210
01:38:45.619 --> 01:38:47.021
Both my parents are attorneys and they would

2211
01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:48.455
kill me if I ever got arrested.

2212
01:38:48.455 --> 01:38:50.424
- Oh no. you can't think like that though.

2213
01:38:50.424 --> 01:38:51.458
Look at me.

2214
01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:53.260
Listen to me.

2215
01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:54.929
You trust me. right?

2216
01:38:55.763 --> 01:38:57.031
- Yeah.

2217
01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:58.465
- [Carmello] You told me that you was ready.

2218
01:38:58.465 --> 01:39:00.868
- I mean I am ready. it's just that I've never

2219
01:39:00.868 --> 01:39:04.171
been in one of these type of situations before.

2220
01:39:04.171 --> 01:39:05.506
- You all right?

2221
01:39:08.909 --> 01:39:09.743
- You know what?

2222
01:39:09.743 --> 01:39:10.678
Fuck it.

2223
01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:11.512
I'm in.

2224
01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:12.346
Let's do this.

2225
01:39:12.346 --> 01:39:13.247
- You sure?

2226
01:39:13.247 --> 01:39:14.081
- Yeah.

2227
01:39:14.982 --> 01:39:16.417
- Give me a kiss.

2228
01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:20.955
I got a gift for you.

2229
01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:21.789
- Oh really?

2230
01:39:21.789 --> 01:39:22.723
- Yeah. you like gifts?

2231
01:39:22.723 --> 01:39:24.224
- You know I do.

2232
01:39:24.224 --> 01:39:27.261
- All right. close your eyes.

2233
01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:28.162
Is they closed?

2234
01:39:28.162 --> 01:39:28.996
- Yes!

2235
01:39:29.863 --> 01:39:30.864
- Hold that.

2236
01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:33.600
- A gun?

2237
01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.002
- Yeah.

2238
01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:36.270
That's for you.

2239
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:37.471
- It's a cute little gun.

2240
01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:38.305
- You like that?

2241
01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:39.473
- Yeah.

2242
01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:40.541
I ain't never shoot a gun before.

2243
01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:42.109
- That's easy.

2244
01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:43.043
Let me show you.

2245
01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:44.511
Come here. let me show you.

2246
01:39:44.511 --> 01:39:46.880
All you gotta do is aim.

2247
01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.517
Focus on the target that you wanna hit.

2248
01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:51.618
And pull the trigger.

2249
01:39:51.618 --> 01:39:54.588
(gun clicks)

2250
01:39:54.588 --> 01:39:57.157
I know exactly which target I'm trying to hit.

2251
01:39:57.157 --> 01:39:58.158
- Oh really?

2252
01:39:58.158 --> 01:40:00.527
You think you got good aim?

2253
01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:02.429
- I have excellent aim.

2254
01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:12.673
(tense music)

2255
01:40:21.415 --> 01:40:22.750
- Right on time.

2256
01:40:31.792 --> 01:40:33.627
- Oh my God. Rell!

2257
01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:34.461
- [Rell] No!

2258
01:40:34.461 --> 01:40:35.295
- [Frankie] Get him!

2259
01:40:35.295 --> 01:40:37.264
Get your man. Tony!

2260
01:40:37.264 --> 01:40:38.499
Get that piece of shit!

2261
01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:39.633
- Tyrel. this be that pretty little

2262
01:40:39.633 --> 01:40:42.002
girlfriend I hear so much about?

2263
01:40:42.002 --> 01:40:43.270
- Let go of her!

2264
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:44.805
- Get him. Frankie!

2265
01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:46.106
- [Frankie] Get down. you fucking pussy!

2266
01:40:46.106 --> 01:40:47.541
- Tyrel. it'd be a real shame if that

2267
01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:49.009
pretty little face got messed up.

2268
01:40:49.009 --> 01:40:51.745
You know Frankie stays thirsty for that wet pussy.

2269
01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:52.980
- Fuck you. bitch!

2270
01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:53.981
She pregnant!

2271
01:40:53.981 --> 01:40:55.682
I'm gonna fuck him up!

2272
01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:57.651
- [Frankie] Get fucking down!

2273
01:40:57.651 --> 01:40:59.153
- Leave him the fuck alone!

2274
01:40:59.153 --> 01:41:02.489
- [Tony] Shut the fuck up. fucking bitch!

2275
01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:06.727
- Say goodbye to your girlfriend. Tyrel.

2276
01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:09.963
And just so you know. this isn't just about RaQuan.

2277
01:41:09.963 --> 01:41:12.099
You been scheming money for years.

2278
01:41:12.099 --> 01:41:14.334
And didn't think we'd find out?

2279
01:41:14.334 --> 01:41:15.869
But we know everything.

2280
01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:17.871
My father might've had a soft spot for you.

2281
01:41:17.871 --> 01:41:19.373
but I've been waiting for this moment

2282
01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:21.108
for a fucking long time.

2283
01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:22.810
Taking you the fuck down.

2284
01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:23.911
- Wait!

2285
01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:25.312
I'll do anything!

2286
01:41:26.447 --> 01:41:28.415
Anything. please just don't kill him!

2287
01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:31.018
- Tyrel. do you see this?

2288
01:41:31.018 --> 01:41:34.154
Your girl is begging and pleading for your life.

2289
01:41:34.154 --> 01:41:37.057
Now that's on some Romeo and Juliet type of shit.

2290
01:41:37.057 --> 01:41:38.759
(LaDonna chuckles)

2291
01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:39.793
Frank.

2292
01:41:39.793 --> 01:41:41.028
- Yes ma'am?

2293
01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:44.498
- Take care of her like a female dog in heat!

2294
01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:48.535
(dramatic music)

2295
01:41:48.535 --> 01:41:49.837
- No!

2296
01:41:49.837 --> 01:41:50.637
No!

2297
01:41:54.007 --> 01:41:54.808
No. no!

2298
01:41:56.009 --> 01:41:58.145
- [Frankie] Stop fucking fighting!

2299
01:41:58.145 --> 01:42:00.514
(Takia sobs)

2300
01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:09.456
(gun cocks)

2301
01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:12.292
(rapid heartbeat)

2302
01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:15.295
(gun fires)

2303
01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:16.130
- Rell!

2304
01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:18.298
Rell!

2305
01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:21.268
Rell!

2306
01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:26.406
- See what we get for working with niggers?

2307
01:42:26.406 --> 01:42:28.742
Eat shit. you fucking spook.

2308
01:42:31.245 --> 01:42:33.514
(girls sobbing)

2309
01:42:33.514 --> 01:42:36.216
- Oh my god. Takia I hope you're okay.

2310
01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:37.151
Why?

2311
01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:39.219
Why has it gotta be Takia?

2312
01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:42.623
- You gonna be okay. baby.

2313
01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:45.492
Girls. do you mind giving me

2314
01:42:45.492 --> 01:42:47.561
a moment alone with Takia please?

2315
01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:48.395
- Come on.

2316
01:42:54.701 --> 01:42:58.005
- I know I ain't done right by you as a mother.

2317
01:42:58.005 --> 01:42:59.940
I failed you and your brothers.

2318
01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:04.144
But God has been punishing me for my evil deeds.

2319
01:43:04.144 --> 01:43:06.413
I started going to church.

2320
01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:07.848
I even got saved.

2321
01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:12.452
I removed that demon alcohol from my life.

2322
01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:18.025
I started going to the Welfare to Work program.

2323
01:43:18.025 --> 01:43:20.861
I got a certificate in data entry.

2324
01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:26.567
I landed a good job with Blue Cross & Blue Shield.

2325
01:43:27.434 --> 01:43:29.836
I'm a temp. but it's a start.

2326
01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:33.407
I made a deal.

2327
01:43:35.576 --> 01:43:36.410
With God.

2328
01:43:38.178 --> 01:43:42.683
That if He gave my beautiful daughter a second chance.

2329
01:43:46.286 --> 01:43:49.623
I would give my all to being the mother.

2330
01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:53.927
That I never was to my children.

2331
01:43:58.999 --> 01:44:01.602
My sons I lost to sins of greed.

2332
01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:05.138
And you. Takia.

2333
01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:10.344
I lost to the streets.

2334
01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:13.080
Instead of protecting you!

2335
01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:14.348
Baby I watched.

2336
01:44:15.682 --> 01:44:17.451
I sat by and watched.

2337
01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:22.022
You give your precious body away.

2338
01:44:25.058 --> 01:44:26.893
I've been such a fool!

2339
01:44:30.797 --> 01:44:31.632
Lord!

2340
01:44:34.768 --> 01:44:39.039
In Jesus Christ. please take hold and heal my baby.

2341
01:44:40.274 --> 01:44:42.776
Lord. I know you're listening.

2342
01:44:45.812 --> 01:44:46.747
- What's wrong?

2343
01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:48.915
Why ain't you eating your food?

2344
01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:51.318
- I guess Takia and everything that's happened to her

2345
01:44:51.318 --> 01:44:53.954
has really been on my mind a lot.

2346
01:44:53.954 --> 01:44:55.222
I just...

2347
01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:56.556
I wish I could do more to help her. you know?

2348
01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:57.758
- Yeah. well like I told you before.

2349
01:44:57.758 --> 01:44:59.426
ain't nothing you could've done.

2350
01:44:59.426 --> 01:45:01.628
Ain't nothing nobody could've done. Mya.

2351
01:45:01.628 --> 01:45:03.897
The nigga was in over his head.

2352
01:45:03.897 --> 01:45:05.332
Bitch fucking that money up.

2353
01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:06.500
Niggas in the street saying that nigga

2354
01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.734
had a million dollar tab. Mya.

2355
01:45:07.734 --> 01:45:08.969
That's a lot of fucking money.

2356
01:45:08.969 --> 01:45:09.903
- Are you serious?

2357
01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:11.171
- Yeah.

2358
01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:12.339
Listen. let me explain something to you.

2359
01:45:12.339 --> 01:45:13.940
When you doing business. street business

2360
01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:16.109
with them Italians. it's different.

2361
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:17.077
You know what I'm saying?

2362
01:45:17.077 --> 01:45:18.445
It's a little tricky.

2363
01:45:18.445 --> 01:45:19.880
I don't think he knew what he was doing

2364
01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:21.581
enough to play that game with them.

2365
01:45:21.581 --> 01:45:22.883
So he got clipped.

2366
01:45:22.883 --> 01:45:25.085
And I'm not surprised.

2367
01:45:25.085 --> 01:45:26.920
But you lucky that you ain't get

2368
01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.655
caught up in the middle of that bullshit.

2369
01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:33.660
I'd have had to light everybody the fuck up in South Philly.

2370
01:45:35.095 --> 01:45:35.929
Okay?

2371
01:45:37.764 --> 01:45:39.733
You all right?

2372
01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:41.134
- Yeah. I'm just tired.

2373
01:45:41.134 --> 01:45:42.469
I wanna go home.

2374
01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:46.506
- All right. okay.

2375
01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:56.450
I don't wanna be mean.

2376
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:58.952
but you gotta stop being so emotional. Mya.

2377
01:45:58.952 --> 01:46:01.855
Emotions bring down empires.

2378
01:46:01.855 --> 01:46:02.689
All right?

2379
01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:04.591
(phone ringing)

2380
01:46:04.591 --> 01:46:05.425
Hello?

Dawg. it's not that fucking hard.

01:46:18.271 --> 01:46:20.574
Can you handle it or not?

2386
01:46:20.574 --> 01:46:22.075
All right. well get it the fuck handled then!

2387

Black ass wouldn't even be running shit

2397
01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:49.803

2398
01:46:49.803 --> 01:46:52.606

2399
01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:55.275
(phone ringing)

2400
01:46:59.379 --> 01:47:00.647

01:47:20.233 --> 01:47:21.067

Okay?

01:47:33.213 --> 01:47:34.047
- No.

2420
01:47:34.047 --> 01:47:35.115
You're a fucking boss.

01:47:35.115 --> 01:47:36.783
You run the shit. okay?

2422
01:47:36.783 --> 01:47:37.884
You run the city.

2423
01:47:37.884 --> 01:47:39.319
You make the shit go down.

2424
01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:40.253
Not him.

2425
01:47:40.253 --> 01:47:41.455
You.

Fuck his black ass. how about that?

2429
01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:48.862
And do what you do best.

Get this fucking money.

2433
01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:00.774
Act like a boss.

2434
01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:03.443
Bosses get what they want right?

2435
01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:08.448
- Hey Mira. go and check the door.

2436
01:48:08.448 --> 01:48:10.350
Make sure no NCA's coming down the hall.

2437
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:14.421
- Yeah girl. 'cause ain't nobody trying to get suspended.

2438
01:48:14.421 --> 01:48:15.455

Y'all can chill out.

01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:18.124

- Well what the fuck?

2442
01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:21.561
Did Takia just fall off the face of the Earth or something?

2443
01:48:21.561 --> 01:48:23.296
I mean I heard about her boyfriend

2444
01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:25.098
from South Philly getting killed.

2445
01:48:25.098 --> 01:48:27.000
That nigga had a hit out on him.

2446
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:28.235

01:48:28.235 --> 01:48:30.103

01:48:33.073 --> 01:48:35.742
You move again and I'll stomp your fucking head!

2451
01:48:35.742 --> 01:48:37.944

Damn. that's fucked up.

2460
01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:51.558

2464
01:48:57.063 --> 01:48:58.732

2465
01:48:58.732 --> 01:49:01.334
(hip hop music)

2466
01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:07.407
- Yo yo yo yo. yo yo yo. Mya.

2467

I heard about what happened with Takia. you okay?

2468

- Look. I'm okay Smoke. but let go of me.

2469
01:49:11.678 --> 01:49:13.313
Shit. I got a lot of my mind right now

2470
01:49:13.313 --> 01:49:14.781
and I don't got time to talk.

2471
01:49:14.781 --> 01:49:16.650
- All right. well can you stop fronting for two seconds?

2472
01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:18.652
I'm just trying to bust it out with you real quick.

2473
01:49:18.652 --> 01:49:21.121
Stop acting like you don't miss a nigga.

2474
01:49:21.121 --> 01:49:22.222
- Don't flatter yourself.

2475
01:49:22.222 --> 01:49:24.791
You the last thing on my mind.

2476
01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:26.359
- Stop feeling yourself. all right?

2477
01:49:26.359 --> 01:49:27.561
Don't forget that I'm the one that had you

2478
01:49:27.561 --> 01:49:29.496
sneaking out your parents' big ass crib

2479
01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:31.498
to come hustle with me on a dirty ass block.

2480
01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:33.667
- Oh please. that was a lifetime ago.

2481
01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:36.269
That shit was cool when I was like 15.

2482
01:49:36.269 --> 01:49:39.139
But you still in that same nickel and dime.

2483

01:49:42.375 --> 01:49:44.210
You still a worker. Smoke.

And I only fuck with bosses.

2486
01:49:45.579 --> 01:49:46.646

01:49:46.646 --> 01:49:48.748

- So are you coming or not?

2492
01:51:17.003 --> 01:51:20.573
We had that conversation an hour ago.

What the fuck is wrong with you. yo?

2532

When I first met you.

2533
01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:41.154
You was busting your ass at Marshall's catching a bus!

2534
01:52:41.154 --> 01:52:43.323
Dealing with that broke ass nigga Mally!

2535
01:52:43.323 --> 01:52:47.594
And you talk about you wanna fucking leave me?

2536
01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.763
Like I'm some fucking nut-ass nigga?

2537
01:52:49.763 --> 01:52:52.332
(tense music)

2538
01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:03.209
Raven.

And myself.

2546
01:53:32.372 --> 01:53:35.341
If you think you gonna fucking leave me.

2547
01:53:35.341 --> 01:53:37.343
- (sobs) Nickels you don't have to do this.

2548
01:53:37.343 --> 01:53:39.679

- Where?

2592
01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:06.459

01:57:09.489 --> 01:57:10.323
- Mmmhm.

2607
01:57:14.794 --> 01:57:16.229

01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:17.797
Please don't ever let me go.

2609
01:57:17.797 --> 01:57:19.732
- I'll die before I do.

2610
01:57:19.732 --> 01:57:22.268
I promise you another man won't ever put his hands on you.

2611
01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:24.771
How about that marrying thing?

2612
01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:37.116
(Raven shrieks)

2613
01:57:37.116 --> 01:57:37.950

Look. let me take her out of here.

2619
01:57:47.827 --> 01:57:49.262
Ain't nobody gotta get hurt.

2620
01:57:49.262 --> 01:57:52.198
- Yo. I clearly remember your face.

2621
01:57:53.166 --> 01:57:55.568
And that black caddy outside.

2622
01:57:56.769 --> 01:57:58.337
You that same nigga Raven was talking to

01:57:58.337 --> 01:58:01.441

2624
01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:03.776
Yeah. I smoke a lot of weed.

2625
01:58:03.776 --> 01:58:06.045
But I got a spot on memory.

2626
01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.682
Raven you think you fucking slick?

01:58:32.071 --> 01:58:33.539
- Man kill this motherfucker. Mal!

2641
01:58:39.145 --> 01:58:41.914
(suspense music)

2642
01:58:44.217 --> 01:58:45.051
Nickels!

(Raheem groans)

2651
01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:12.578
Raven you not gonna catch no bodies.

2652
01:59:12.578 --> 01:59:14.313
How about you give me the gun.

2653
01:59:14.313 --> 01:59:16.983
And some of that pussy Nickels was so crazy about.

2654
01:59:16.983 --> 01:59:17.950
And I'll let you live.

2655
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:19.118
- [Nadir] Kill this nigga!

2656
01:59:19.118 --> 01:59:21.554
(gun firing)

2657
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:25.825
- Where's your keys?

2658
01:59:25.825 --> 01:59:27.860
- My back pocket.

2659
01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:29.262
- We gotta get you out of here.

2660
01:59:29.262 --> 01:59:30.663
We gotta get you to the hospital.

2661
01:59:30.663 --> 01:59:31.497

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.502
(Raven sobs)

2664
01:59:36.502 --> 01:59:38.304
Don't you dare die on me. Nadir!

2665
01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:39.572
Don't you dare!

2666
01:59:42.742 --> 01:59:47.146
Please in the name of the Lord. I can't take losing you.

2667
01:59:47.146 --> 01:59:48.214
Not this one.

2668
01:59:49.081 --> 01:59:49.982

2669
01:59:51.284 --> 01:59:53.052
You came back for me!

2670
01:59:54.854 --> 01:59:56.856
I had to go through everything I went through

2671
01:59:56.856 --> 01:59:59.892
with Mally and Nickels just to get to you.

2672
01:59:59.892 --> 02:00:01.327
My one true love.

2673
02:00:02.495 --> 02:00:04.897
(Raven sobs)

2674
02:00:07.833 --> 02:00:10.603
(sirens wailing)

2675
02:00:16.242 --> 02:00:19.045
(hip hop music)

2676
02:00:19.045 --> 02:00:19.912
- [Winters] Let's go.

2677
02:00:19.912 --> 02:00:20.746
Come on.

2678
02:00:27.119 --> 02:00:28.120
Have a seat.

2679
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:32.225
Good?

2680
02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:37.230
- Well. well. well.

2681
02:00:38.464 --> 02:00:41.267
If it isn't the king cobra himself.

2682
02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.501
Carmello Black.

2683
02:00:43.836 --> 02:00:46.639
We've been watching you for years.

2684
02:00:48.207 --> 02:00:50.543
Always so careful.

2685
02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:51.344
Until now.

2686
02:00:52.578 --> 02:00:56.148
We found 30 kilos of cocaine in your trunk.

2687
02:00:57.350 --> 02:01:00.253
That's enough to supply the whole east coast.

2688
02:01:00.253 --> 02:01:03.656
No high price lawyer is gonna get you off.

2689
02:01:06.325 --> 02:01:08.894
What's that. 30. 40 years?

2690
02:01:08.894 --> 02:01:11.130
Oh. and not including all the list

2691
02:01:11.130 --> 02:01:13.699
of bodies that you left behind.

2692
02:01:15.501 --> 02:01:17.903
Yeah. little birdie gave up all your tape.

2693
02:01:17.903 --> 02:01:20.673
- Fuck your birdie. nigga.

2694
02:01:20.673 --> 02:01:21.974
- You know what. Black?

2695
02:01:21.974 --> 02:01:23.876
Let's make this easy.

2696
02:01:23.876 --> 02:01:26.078
Give me the names.

2697
02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:30.683
Give me every name of everybody in your operation.

2698
02:01:30.683 --> 02:01:32.952
I'll knock off two decades.

2699
02:01:35.154 --> 02:01:37.056
So let's make it easy.

2700
02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:38.090
Give us the names.

2701
02:01:38.090 --> 02:01:39.125
- I ain't no rat.

2702
02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:41.193
- You know that.

2703
02:01:41.193 --> 02:01:44.163
I'll do a hundred years on my head

2704
02:01:44.163 --> 02:01:45.765
before I snitch to y'all.

2705
02:01:45.765 --> 02:01:49.268
Man. fuck a federal agent or whatever the fuck y'all is.

2706
02:01:49.268 --> 02:01:52.138
Whatever my time's gonna be. let it be.

2707
02:01:52.138 --> 02:01:54.006
I ain't scared. I ain't worried about that.

2708
02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:54.807
I'm good.

2709
02:01:56.242 --> 02:01:58.444
Long as my hood know I went out like a real one.

2710
02:01:58.444 --> 02:02:00.046
that's the only thing that matter to me.

2711
02:02:00.046 --> 02:02:03.215
Let me get my motherfucking phone call.

2712
02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:14.894
- So let me ask you a question.

2713
02:02:14.894 --> 02:02:16.962
How did a pretty girl like yourself

2714
02:02:16.962 --> 02:02:18.531
get mixed up with one of Philadelphia's

2715
02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:21.200
most notorious drug traffickers?

2716
02:02:24.303 --> 02:02:27.173
We've been watching you. Mya.

2717
02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:29.375
Look. just tell us what we need to know.

2718
02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:33.045
We'll make sure that this goes easy for you.

2719
02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:35.715
- Mya Campbell.

2720
02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:40.019
Age 18.

2721
02:02:40.986 --> 02:02:44.123
Just graduated from high school.

2722
02:02:44.123 --> 02:02:48.461
Both parents are attorneys at prestigious law firms.

2723
02:02:49.895 --> 02:02:52.298
Got no prior arrests.

2724
02:02:52.298 --> 02:02:53.966
No juvenile history.

2725
02:02:55.201 --> 02:02:56.168
She's clean.

2726
02:02:58.571 --> 02:03:01.474
Miss Campbell. this is a very serious

2727
02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:04.276
situation we got here. okay?

2728
02:03:04.276 --> 02:03:06.078
The amount of drugs your little boyfriend

2729
02:03:06.078 --> 02:03:08.180
Carmello Black was transporting?

2730
02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:12.084
You're guaranteed to do four to seven years. okay?

2731
02:03:12.084 --> 02:03:16.021
That is unless you choose to cooperate with us.

2732
02:03:18.224 --> 02:03:23.229
That way we'll make sure they take it easy on you.

2733
02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:26.065
- Think about your life. Mya.

2734
02:03:26.065 --> 02:03:28.367
Carmello Black is a low life scum

2735
02:03:28.367 --> 02:03:30.603
that only thinks about himself.

2736
02:03:30.603 --> 02:03:34.507
- Believe me hon. he is not thinking about you right now.

2737
02:03:34.507 --> 02:03:35.875
Tell us what you know.

2738
02:03:35.875 --> 02:03:37.710
That way you won't be spending some

2739
02:03:37.710 --> 02:03:40.679
of the best years of your life behind bars

2740
02:03:40.679 --> 02:03:43.949
in one of those nasty little jumpsuits.

2741
02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:46.719
- Please.

2742
02:03:46.719 --> 02:03:49.121
You can't scare me.

2743
02:03:49.121 --> 02:03:51.323
You feds talk a real good one.

2744
02:03:51.323 --> 02:03:53.959
but my father is one of the best.

2745
02:03:53.959 --> 02:03:57.630
most respected attorneys in Philadelphia.

2746
02:03:57.630 --> 02:03:59.765
Y'all don't have nothing to hold me.

2747
02:03:59.765 --> 02:04:01.867
I'll be out of here by tonight.

2748
02:04:01.867 --> 02:04:05.137
I'm not your average teenage girl.

2749
02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:08.307
Now can I get my fucking phone call please to my parents?

2750
02:04:08.307 --> 02:04:09.842
(DeMarcos chuckles)

2751
02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:12.645
- You're pretty feisty aren't you?

2752
02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:14.079
But you can be broken.

2753
02:04:14.079 --> 02:04:15.514
- You just think you and Black

2754
02:04:15.514 --> 02:04:19.351
are two lovers against the world don't you?

2755
02:04:19.351 --> 02:04:23.122
- I think Ms. Campbell needs a reality check.

2756
02:04:24.256 --> 02:04:25.591
- Why don't you take a look at what

2757
02:04:25.591 --> 02:04:26.892
your Prince Charming's been doing

2758
02:04:26.892 --> 02:04:28.794
behind your back all this time.

2759
02:04:28.794 --> 02:04:31.297
(tense music)

2760
02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:45.911
Your parents are here.

2761
02:04:56.489 --> 02:04:57.323
- Fuck.

2762
02:04:58.891 --> 02:04:59.892
Fuck. Black!

2763
02:05:01.293 --> 02:05:03.629
How could you do this to me?

2764
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:05.998
What did I do?

2765
02:05:07.066 --> 02:05:09.568
Mya. what the fuck did you do?

2766
02:05:10.636 --> 02:05:13.172
I'm gonna go to prison.

2767
02:05:13.172 --> 02:05:16.342
Oh fuck. my parents are gonna kill me.

2768
02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:20.579
I did this for you. Black.

2769
02:05:20.579 --> 02:05:23.382
I thought it was me and you against the world.

2770
02:05:23.382 --> 02:05:26.719
And you creeping around with some bitch!

2771
02:05:30.623 --> 02:05:34.660
If I get charged with a felony I can't go to college.

2772
02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:38.397
I can't even get a job at fucking McDonald's!

2773
02:05:46.972 --> 02:05:48.240
Calm down. Mya.

2774
02:05:49.375 --> 02:05:50.876
Calm down. Mya.

2775
02:05:50.876 --> 02:05:52.311
Pull it together.

2776
02:05:54.246 --> 02:05:56.448
You gonna get through this.

2777
02:05:56.448 --> 02:05:58.450
'Cause you Mya Campbell.

2778
02:06:00.686 --> 02:06:02.755
You Mya fucking Campbell.

2779
02:06:13.732 --> 02:06:15.301
- Mya.

2780
02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:16.135
- Dad.

2781
02:06:19.605 --> 02:06:22.174
- [LaTanya] Mya. this can't be reality right now.

2782
02:06:22.174 --> 02:06:23.409
- Can't be reality.

2783
02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:24.777
- You're in here for drug trafficking?

2784
02:06:24.777 --> 02:06:26.145
- I can't believe this.

2785
02:06:26.145 --> 02:06:27.479
- We came all the way over here

2786
02:06:27.479 --> 02:06:29.982
from a charity event for this?

2787
02:06:31.116 --> 02:06:32.851
Terrance. we are gonna be blacklisted

2788
02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:33.953
because of your daughter.

2789
02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:34.887
- Blacklisted?

2790
02:06:34.887 --> 02:06:36.121
I finally see what your mother's

2791
02:06:36.121 --> 02:06:37.923
been telling me about you this whole time!

2792
02:06:37.923 --> 02:06:41.327
Mya how can you disgrace our family like this?

2793
02:06:41.327 --> 02:06:42.561
You know what. LaTanya?

2794
02:06:42.561 --> 02:06:44.029
I don't even know who my daughter is anymore.

2795
02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:45.831
I don't even know who she is!

2796
02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:47.900
Involved with drugs of all things?

2797
02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:50.936
I bust my ass to get my family out of North Philly.

2798
02:06:50.936 --> 02:06:52.404
I mean I don't know. we spoiled you.

2799
02:06:52.404 --> 02:06:54.139
Given you everything you've ever asked for no matter

2800
02:06:54.139 --> 02:06:57.376
what the price and you go and do this.

2801
02:06:57.376 --> 02:06:59.278
My entire law firm is laughing at me

2802
02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:01.847
behind my back Mya. do you understand that?

2803
02:07:01.847 --> 02:07:03.582
- I am so sorry.

2804
02:07:03.582 --> 02:07:04.850
- You know what?

2805
02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:06.352
I can't even look at her right now.

2806
02:07:06.352 --> 02:07:08.454
I can't even look at her.

2807
02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:13.192
- Get to stepping right now.

2808
02:07:16.595 --> 02:07:18.797
(hip hop music)

2809
02:07:18.797 --> 02:07:20.032
- [Mya VO] The fourth month

2810
02:07:20.032 --> 02:07:21.834
of my year sentence starts today.

2811
02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:24.637
And so does the eighth month of my pregnancy.

2812
02:07:24.637 --> 02:07:27.006
A few days after my father pulled some strings

2813
02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:30.709
and got me released. I found out I was pregnant.

2814
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:33.812
The best and the worst news of my life.

2815
02:07:33.812 --> 02:07:35.914
After I found out that Carmello was sentenced

2816
02:07:35.914 --> 02:07:39.618
to life in prison I could have died.

2817
02:07:39.618 --> 02:07:42.054
I've let my parents down.

2818
02:07:42.054 --> 02:07:44.556
My mother has written me the nastiest letters

2819
02:07:44.556 --> 02:07:47.893
using every four letter word in the book.

2820
02:07:47.893 --> 02:07:50.195
And my dad won't even respond.

2821
02:07:50.195 --> 02:07:51.463
My dad.

2822
02:07:51.463 --> 02:07:54.133
Hurting him is what's killing me the most.

2823
02:07:54.133 --> 02:07:55.601
And the thought of giving birth in this

2824
02:07:55.601 --> 02:07:58.404
filthy ass prison gives me the creeps.

2825
02:07:58.404 --> 02:08:00.172
But I gotta stand strong.

2826
02:08:00.172 --> 02:08:01.940
That's how Black molded me.

2827
02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:04.343
In case you're wondering. I forgave Black

2828
02:08:04.343 --> 02:08:06.912
for his indiscretion with that stank-ass whore.

2829
02:08:06.912 --> 02:08:08.614
But any man in a position of power

2830
02:08:08.614 --> 02:08:11.450
is going to get easy pussy thrown in his face.

2831
02:08:11.450 --> 02:08:14.386
Sometimes it's just too hard to resist.

2832
02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:15.788
And besides. we made something

2833
02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:18.490
so beautiful out of our love.

2834
02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:21.660
Our baby. Carmello Samuel Jr. will be due

2835
02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:24.897
in a month and I can't wait to get my body back.

2836
02:08:24.897 --> 02:08:27.399
I can do this time standing on my head.

2837
02:08:27.399 --> 02:08:29.401
But poor Black. my love?

2838
02:08:30.602 --> 02:08:32.871
He just turned 24 a few weeks back.

2839
02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:34.540
He gonna be trapped like a tiger

2840
02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.775
in that cage for the rest of his life.

2841
02:08:36.775 --> 02:08:39.178
Another good black man down.

2842
02:08:39.178 --> 02:08:41.447
When I step foot out of this jail.

2843
02:08:41.447 --> 02:08:44.917
I swear on everything I'm gonna stay that bitch.

2844
02:08:44.917 --> 02:08:46.885
I might be missing 1999.

2845
02:08:46.885 --> 02:08:49.922
but then summer 2000 is gonna be mine.

2846
02:08:49.922 --> 02:08:52.658
The resurrection of Mya Campbell.

2847
02:08:52.658 --> 02:08:55.327
