00:00:57.208 --> 00:01:01.500
Once upon a time.
in the faraway lands of the Orient.

4
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.583
three wise men began a long journey

5
00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:09.958
guided by a dazzling star:

6
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.125
the star of Bethlehem.

7
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.375
On the backs of their camels.
they rode day and night without rest

8
00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:25.000
until they came to Bethlehem
to attend the birth of the Baby Jesus.

9
00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:31.250
On reaching the stable.
they knelt before the newborn

10
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.083
to deliver to him three presents.

11
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.875
The first. worthy of a king: gold.

12
00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:40.333
The second.
fit for a man: myrrh.

13
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.500
And the third. the offering
a God deserves: incense.

14
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.416
At this point they were blessed

15
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.791
with the gift of giving presents
to all the world's boys and girls.

16
00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:57.500
And their names became
a reason for celebration.

17
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.708
Since then. year after year.

18
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:04.500
Melchior. Caspar y Balthazar.
the Three Kings.

19
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.041
have kept taking love. joy.
and harmony wherever they go.

20
00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.833
TODAY

21
00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:16.291
Come on now! Move it!
They'll give us the grapes here!

22
00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:19.416
Calm and serenity. Melchior.
a little patience.

23
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.958
Hey. you. hold it.
Where are you going?

24
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.125
Stop!

25
00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:30.666
DECEMBER 22

26
00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:43.916
Move it!

27
00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:46.875
Holy shit!
I've had it up to my crown!

28
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.541
I knew the 22nd
was a bad day to cross.

29
00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:53.333
Oh. yeah? Then why the heck
didn't you say anything?

30
00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:55.875
Of course I did. several times.

31
00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.708
but since you don't listen to me...
To me or anyone.

32
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:02.166
I've been listening to you
for 2000 years.

33
00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.125
Don't do that. you'll stress them out.

34
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.541
Finally!

35
00:03:16.208 --> 00:03:18.625
Good evening.
Show me your papers.

36
00:03:18.708 --> 00:03:20.750
What is this?

37
00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:24.250
Is this possible? Here too?

38
00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:26.625
They're gonna shit themselves.

39
00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.666
Here come the Kings.

40
00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:34.291
with the Christmas gift!

41
00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:36.041
Watch these guys.
they're very merry.

42
00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:39.625
They bring the boy-child

43
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:42.958
beautiful gifts!

44
00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:46.291
Green butterfish...
Lemon leaves...

45
00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:52.333
The Virgin Mary. mother of the Lord.

46
00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.500
Papers.

47
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.666
Paco. Felipe and Oriol.

48
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.250
-Anything to declare?
-No. sir.

49
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:08.166
What was that?

50
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.916
-It's my cellphone.
-My tummy.

51
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.583
-His tummy.
-His cellphone.

52
00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:14.500
Out of the vehicle now
and open up the back.

53
00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:22.208
I'm going to open the door.

54
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:27.750
Guardia Civil here.

55
00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:33.333
What the hell...?

56
00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:36.166
No. don't do that.
they get stressed out.

57
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.916
Will you give them back the...?

58
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.125
Lad. drop the gun.

59
00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:47.833
-Don't shoot!
-I can't!

60
00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:49.625
-I'm talking to him!
-It was an accident.

61
00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:51.500
I have a wife and two kids.

62
00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:55.291
No. no. we know that.
Mari Carmen. Rebe and Juancar.

63
00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:59.250
But listen. we have no intention
of hurting you.

64
00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:02.083
-Right. friends?
-True. true.

65
00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:05.083
Still. you can forget
the HD tablet.

66
00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:08.833
the speedcross trainers
and the Rosanna disc. Juanito.

67
00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:11.250
You know them?

68
00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:13.583
How do you know them?

69
00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.083
What is this. magic?

70
00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:20.916
What the hell...?

71
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.333
The men from the van.
you're surrounded!

72
00:05:23.416 --> 00:05:25.000
Hands up!

73
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.333
And these guys?

74
00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:35.750
Juanito.

75
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:40.166
do you want to see
some proper magic?

76
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.291
Look.

77
00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:48.583
These guys? Where are they?
Where did they go?

78
00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:49.666
Tell the commander.

79
00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.208
What the hell happened here?

80
00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:07.916
Jesus. Mary and Joseph!

81
00:06:08.791 --> 00:06:10.041
What a welcome.

82
00:06:10.708 --> 00:06:11.916
That was close.

83
00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:21.458
Remind you of something?

84
00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:23.083
Yes.

85
00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:26.250
What times they were. eh?

86
00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:32.416
Good evening.

87
00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:53.541
What's this?

88
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.458
That. madam. is myrrh.

89
00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.166
What's it for?

90
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:11.000
Not even God knows.

91
00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:26.208
THE THREE WISE MEN VS SANTA

92
00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:29.000
DECEMBER 23RD

93
00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.708
BELÉN GUESTHOUSE - BEDS

94
00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.500
We've been to the four corners
of the Earth.

95
00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.833
and this is still my favorite spot.

96
00:07:40.916 --> 00:07:44.791
Yeah. yeah... I'm going to bed.
my back's a mess from so much camel.

97
00:07:44.875 --> 00:07:47.791
Besides. remember.
we have a meeting tomorrow.

98
00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:51.625
You're making it worse.
And be careful with Belén.

99
00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:53.958
all we need is for her
to find out who you are.

100
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:56.833
What do you mean?
Belén and I are just friends.

101
00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:58.791
Besides. I know very well

102
00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:02.041
that we mustn't get involved
in the non-magical world.

103
00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:11.250
Have you changed your hair?

104
00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:17.375
Well. considering we haven't
seen each other for a year...

105
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:22.666
I've cut it four or five times.

106
00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:27.166
-Well. you look very pretty.
-Thanks.

107
00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:30.708
You're looking good too.

108
00:08:33.916 --> 00:08:36.875
So? How's life going. Belén?

109
00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:40.625
Not as well as you guys.

110
00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:47.333
It's incredible. you haven't
changed at all in years.

111
00:08:47.416 --> 00:08:50.833
It's you. Belén.
you look kindly upon us.

112
00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:54.083
No. I know you have a secret...

113
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:56.708
and I want to know what it is.

114
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:58.500
They're here!

115
00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:00.791
-Run!
-Be good. don't run!

116
00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:01.833
Sofía!

117
00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:04.125
Bea! How are you?

118
00:09:04.208 --> 00:09:06.750
-Sofía. you're so big!
-Hello. Felipe!

119
00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:08.208
Hi! It's great to see you!

120
00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:10.625
Hi! How are you. little ones?

121
00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:12.875
-Good. and how are you?
-Hi. girl.

122
00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:13.958
Hello. Paco.

123
00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:18.375
What's that? Don't tell me.
the letter to the Three Kings.

124
00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.333
It's the letter to Santa. He's the best.

125
00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:23.291
Why not write to the Magi instead?

126
00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:26.250
They're plan B. What Santa
doesn't bring. you ask them for.

127
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:28.958
The Kings aren't plan B.
they're plan A.

128
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:30.750
the main course.

129
00:09:31.041 --> 00:09:34.708
Santa's like the bowl of olives
while you wait to get served.

130
00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:37.833
Look. Oriol. I took your advice
and I've been reading all year.

131
00:09:37.916 --> 00:09:42.208
Very good. Sofia!
Nothing like a good book on...

132
00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.625
MYTHS OF THE KRAMPUS

133
00:09:45.625 --> 00:09:48.416
Sofía. what are you doing reading this?

134
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.708
The Krampus is an evil being
who hates Christmas.

135
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:58.458
He feeds on hate and abducts
and punishes boys and girls like you.

136
00:10:00.041 --> 00:10:01.125
Aren't you scared?

137
00:10:01.208 --> 00:10:03.333
I don't believe in the Krampus
and that crap. okay?

138
00:10:03.416 --> 00:10:05.791
They're stories for little kids.

139
00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:07.916
like Santa Claus.
the Three Kings. Harry Potter...

140
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.791
You don't believe in the Three Kings?

141
00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:12.416
-I believe in them.
-That's the way I like it.

142
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.625
-And who's your favorite?
-Any except the one in the middle.

143
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.750
"The one in the middle"?

144
00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:24.708
That depends on how they line up.

145
00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:31.041
We don't know if there's life
in outer space!

146
00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:33.000
MAYOR

147
00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:36.458
But we can assure you
that if there is.

148
00:10:37.666 --> 00:10:40.791
they'll be dazzled by
the 15 million lights

149
00:10:40.875 --> 00:10:43.250
that will decorate our streets!

150
00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:46.750
He's always loved Christmas.
Almost more than us.

151
00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:50.000
He's elected every year.
the people adore him.

152
00:10:50.291 --> 00:10:53.583
Alright... Are you sure
this is the right time?

153
00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:57.250
Hold on. I'll look again.
You look. your eyes are better.

154
00:10:58.333 --> 00:11:01.166
"Tra-pe-co ardu-bialen..."

155
00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:03.875
But that's not the time.

156
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:09.875
It was around here. I saw it.

157
00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:12.625
It has to be further down.
I don't know.

158
00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:17.416
Those camels...

159
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:21.083
It's further down. further down.

160
00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:27.291
El Niño Lottery. A sure thing.

161
00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.458
Thanks. but we're not interested.

162
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:32.166
Yes. at 12.

163
00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.125
I said: "A sure thing".

164
00:11:36.208 --> 00:11:40.458
You got your answer.
Thanks. we're not interested.

165
00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:47.000
Excuse me.

166
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.875
are you the new page?

167
00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:53.166
She's the new page.

168
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.250
Sorry. they change the password
all the time.

169
00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:59.041
-Ana Ruiz. at Your Majesties' service.
-What are you doing? Get up

170
00:12:00.416 --> 00:12:03.916
-Melchior touched me!
-Be discreet. lass.

171
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.666
I'm just excited. you know?
You've been my favorite king forever.

172
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.333
And you're Balthazar.
my sister's king.

173
00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:12.833
I admire you so much...

174
00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:14.333
And you're Caspar.

175
00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:18.625
How are you?
Everything alright?

176
00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:23.916
Great. great.

177
00:12:24.458 --> 00:12:25.666
Let's not waste any more time.

178
00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:29.750
You have a lot to see. let's go.

179
00:12:37.708 --> 00:12:40.458
I can't believe I'm about
to enter the Magical World.

180
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:44.125
This is amazing.
The best day of my life.

181
00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:47.250
I've always wondered how
you get into the Magical World

182
00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:51.416
and in class they're so secretive
about it. It must be incredible.

183
00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:57.458
Is it here?

184
00:12:59.041 --> 00:13:00.416
How does it work?

185
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.375
Iris scan. voice recognition.
fingerprint reader?

186
00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:06.416
Look.

187
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:16.958
The key.

188
00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:21.750
With the key.

189
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.541
-I'm a real page.
-In training.

190
00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:31.708
Yes. of course.

191
00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:39.458
The outfits are so cool!

192
00:14:39.541 --> 00:14:41.375
Cool? Uncomfortable!

193
00:14:41.458 --> 00:14:44.250
Listen. these pants ride up...
they get up in my crack and...

194
00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:48.208
Just as well we only transform
in the Magical World.

195
00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:52.583
Well. except on January 5th.

196
00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:55.333
the day you do the parade
and hand out the presents.

197
00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:59.291
All that day you transform
in the real world. right?

198
00:15:06.208 --> 00:15:10.875
Welcome to the city
of the Three Kings.

199
00:15:29.375 --> 00:15:30.708
Gee!

200
00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:01.833
Majesties...

201
00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:03.666
Majesties...

202
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:08.041
-Where are we going now?
-Patience. you'll see.

203
00:16:13.708 --> 00:16:15.666
This is the reading room.

204
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.541
Here we examine
all of the letters that reach us

205
00:16:18.625 --> 00:16:21.208
and cross-check them
with their annual behavior report.

206
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:23.791
"I'm Silvia Martínez and this year
I want a Dobble card game.

207
00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:26.875
well. and the boardgame Hotel.
if that's possible".

208
00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:29.333
Yes. and maybe
you'll finish your lentils.

209
00:16:29.416 --> 00:16:31.250
You always leave
your plate untouched.

210
00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:32.666
Go on. ease up on her.

211
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.333
No. no. Silvia has to ease up
on her mother.

212
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.125
They're tough. aren't they?

213
00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:43.375
Not if you've behaved.

214
00:16:44.958 --> 00:16:46.625
I'm freaking out!

215
00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:48.875
It's all done by hand!
I thought it was a myth.

216
00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.416
Of course. Ana.
we're true artisans.

217
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.291
As we like to say:
There's no modernity...

218
00:16:54.375 --> 00:16:56.625
Without fine tradition!

219
00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:03.625
In this alley the requests are prepared
from the letters read before.

220
00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:05.041
That's great!

221
00:17:05.916 --> 00:17:09.041
And right there.
another kind of request is prepared.

222
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.958
This is the page Carbonilla.

223
00:17:14.041 --> 00:17:16.625
He prepares the coal
for the boys and girls

224
00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:18.500
who misbehaved during the year.

225
00:17:18.583 --> 00:17:22.041
Not the greatest job. but someone
has to do it. right. Carbonilla?

226
00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:23.875
-I guess.
-And this?

227
00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:28.125
-For David Pastor Junior.
-Three bags of coal. Atrocious!

228
00:17:28.208 --> 00:17:31.291
Now I understand why his father
asked for a barbecue.

229
00:17:32.583 --> 00:17:36.958
And here's where our loyal friends.
the messenger hawks.

230
00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:41.208
deposit the letters
that are sent to us. the Magi.

231
00:17:42.541 --> 00:17:43.833
Look. Ana. see that pile?

232
00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:46.416
They're letters for me.

233
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.708
All of them are for you?

234
00:17:49.041 --> 00:17:50.541
And those over there are mine.

235
00:17:51.166 --> 00:17:52.833
Incredible!

236
00:17:53.541 --> 00:17:55.125
And yours. Caspar?

237
00:17:56.625 --> 00:17:57.708
That pile there.

238
00:17:59.166 --> 00:18:02.000
My letters arrive at the last moment

239
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:06.500
because... my fans trust me.

240
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.791
No way! Is that King Cake?

241
00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:14.791
Yes.

242
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.666
Always with a keen eye.

243
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.250
watching over
so that not a single letter is lost.

244
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.416
Delighted. the pleasure's mine.

245
00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:28.708
-You speak Hawk?
-Yes. C1 level. spoken and written.

246
00:18:28.791 --> 00:18:30.250
Impressive.

247
00:18:30.583 --> 00:18:31.625
Shall we continue?

248
00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:36.125
For now. and until you become
an official page.

249
00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:37.708
you'll go with us everywhere.

250
00:18:37.791 --> 00:18:40.916
-You have to meet the CUBMOB.
-Cool.

251
00:18:46.791 --> 00:18:49.708
For the Kings today.
make way. make way!

252
00:18:57.666 --> 00:18:59.958
Pretty cool. huh?

253
00:19:03.666 --> 00:19:09.333
C.U.B.M.O.B.. COMMITTEE OF THE UNIVERSAL
BROTHERHOODS OF MAGICAL AND OUTLANDISH BEINGS

254
00:19:46.541 --> 00:19:48.208
Wow. this is awesome!

255
00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:52.375
Good morning. girl!
Good morning. everyone!

256
00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:53.583
Good morning.

257
00:19:56.541 --> 00:19:59.750
Good morning.
How were your holidays?

258
00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:01.875
Short. as usual.

259
00:20:01.958 --> 00:20:05.333
This year I went to the Seychelles.

260
00:20:06.083 --> 00:20:08.083
All day in the sun!

261
00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:11.791
The first witch to like being toasted.

262
00:20:11.875 --> 00:20:13.166
That's true!

263
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:15.375
Yo. Kings! What's up? All good?

264
00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:18.833
Here. another year handing out
hope and joy.

265
00:20:18.916 --> 00:20:22.208
That's Befana. the Italian witch.

266
00:20:22.541 --> 00:20:25.625
and Olentzero. the coalman from
the Basque Country and Navarra.

267
00:20:26.416 --> 00:20:27.541
And who is that?

268
00:20:28.125 --> 00:20:32.291
Yule the goat. a magical Christmas
being in the Nordic countries.

269
00:20:32.375 --> 00:20:34.333
Actually. he's just decoration.

270
00:20:35.708 --> 00:20:38.458
I'm a goat. but I'm not deaf.

271
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:42.083
Deaf I am not.

272
00:20:42.166 --> 00:20:44.208
This is all so amazing!

273
00:20:44.291 --> 00:20:46.541
The best is yet to come.

274
00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:49.333
Befana. hey. wait for me!

275
00:20:59.916 --> 00:21:01.625
The ceilings are so high!

276
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:04.375
Highnesses. you're on the list.

277
00:21:04.791 --> 00:21:06.500
Go ahead!

278
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.666
Good morning. Your name.

279
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.291
You should know
that my name is Melchior.

280
00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:17.875
King Melchior.

281
00:21:21.416 --> 00:21:26.250
Oh. yes... Excuse me. Majesty.

282
00:21:26.875 --> 00:21:28.666
Go right ahead!

283
00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:32.250
Ana Ruiz. trainee page.

284
00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:38.291
Ana Ruiz. yes. we were advised.

285
00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:43.750
-I'm...
-I know who you are!

286
00:21:43.833 --> 00:21:45.458
Hey. brother. How are you?

287
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.958
Good!

288
00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:57.333
I'm King Caspar.

289
00:21:58.916 --> 00:22:00.125
Okay. okay...

290
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:10.041
I'm sorry. but we don't have
any Caspar.

291
00:22:16.458 --> 00:22:19.958
My God! So many people!

292
00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:22.208
And all of them
bring Christmas presents?

293
00:22:22.291 --> 00:22:25.000
All of them. although the real
function of this gathering

294
00:22:25.083 --> 00:22:28.916
is to organize. protect ourselves
and reach agreements.

295
00:22:30.625 --> 00:22:31.833
What's that flower?

296
00:22:32.583 --> 00:22:36.916
That's the Easter Flower.
The Christmas spirit lives inside it.

297
00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:46.916
-Watch it!
-Careful. you're on the Invisible Man.

298
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.958
Sorry.

299
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:49.791
-What's up. Kings?
-I haven't seen you in ages.

300
00:22:49.875 --> 00:22:52.583
Yes. I've been staying
out of sight lately.

301
00:22:52.666 --> 00:22:55.916
-Let's see each other more this year.
-Yes. see you.

302
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.791
Hold on. I'll shift up.

303
00:23:01.583 --> 00:23:02.958
Who are they up there?

304
00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:04.750
They're a mixed bag.

305
00:23:04.833 --> 00:23:07.916
The Cantabrian El Esteru.
L'Anguleru. Asturian.

306
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.583
the Apalpador. Galician.

307
00:23:09.666 --> 00:23:12.958
and the Tió. who craps out gifts
in Catalonia and Aragón.

308
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:14.333
He craps them out?

309
00:23:14.416 --> 00:23:17.875
Boys and girls hit him with canes
so he defecates presents.

310
00:23:20.083 --> 00:23:21.833
Don't shit me. Tomte.

311
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.000
Tomte. every year the same thing.

312
00:23:28.083 --> 00:23:32.083
-Don't give me stick!
-Then don't be a plank!

313
00:23:35.416 --> 00:23:38.791
Is that Elsa from "Frozen"?
I thought she wasn't real.

314
00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:39.958
No. get outta here.

315
00:23:40.041 --> 00:23:43.666
that's Schnegurowska.
a messenger fairy

316
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:47.541
who conveys the dreams of
boys and girls all over Russia.

317
00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:51.666
Her heart is ice. making her
the world's most neutral magical being.

318
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.125
That's why we chose her
as Chancellor of CUBMOB.

319
00:23:54.208 --> 00:23:56.000
Are you comfortable like that?

320
00:23:57.416 --> 00:23:59.625
Neither comfortable nor uncomfortable.

321
00:23:59.708 --> 00:24:04.250
And Ded Moroz. Grandfather of the Snows
and of the Chancellor too.

322
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:06.458
He looks a lot like Santa Claus.

323
00:24:06.541 --> 00:24:08.958
No. how can you compare Ded
to that freak?

324
00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:11.458
By the way. I haven't seen him.

325
00:24:12.125 --> 00:24:14.083
I love not seeing him.

326
00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:17.000
The session will begin shortly.

327
00:24:23.458 --> 00:24:25.250
Go for them. Elf 1.

328
00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.958
This is priceless.

329
00:24:43.625 --> 00:24:45.041
Do I really have to read this?

330
00:24:49.333 --> 00:24:52.250
"Since the beginning of time.

331
00:24:52.333 --> 00:24:55.750
Christmas has been synonymous
with Santa Claus.

332
00:24:57.208 --> 00:24:59.333
but that's over now".

333
00:24:59.708 --> 00:25:01.625
Good. about time!

334
00:25:06.333 --> 00:25:09.333
"Get ready to receive as he deserves

335
00:25:09.416 --> 00:25:11.666
the new symbol of Christmas".

336
00:25:14.125 --> 00:25:15.291
Presenting...

337
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.000
the one and only. improved.

338
00:25:21.125 --> 00:25:22.916
the children's favorite.

339
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:25.458
the unrivalled:

340
00:25:27.708 --> 00:25:30.083
SANTA 2.0!

341
00:25:32.833 --> 00:25:34.041
Buffoon.

342
00:25:39.083 --> 00:25:41.208
How's my CUBMOB?

343
00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:43.958
I can't hear you!

344
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.541
I said: "How's my CUBMOB"?

345
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.708
Long live Christmas!

346
00:26:12.375 --> 00:26:13.791
Love you guys!

347
00:26:13.875 --> 00:26:15.583
Merry Christmas!

348
00:26:19.458 --> 00:26:20.916
Ciao.

349
00:26:25.208 --> 00:26:27.708
So. can I go in now?

350
00:26:27.791 --> 00:26:29.916
I'm sorry.
but my supervisor says

351
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.583
there's no Geppetto in the files.

352
00:26:34.666 --> 00:26:37.791
Geppetto?
My name's Caspar. King Caspar.

353
00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:44.250
What's going on in there?

354
00:26:46.125 --> 00:26:48.041
I'm sorry. but...

355
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.208
you can't come in.

356
00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.750
I'll call again and check. but...

357
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:58.958
While some prefer to use scrolls.

358
00:26:59.291 --> 00:27:02.958
messenger birds
or go by camel. so to speak.

359
00:27:03.041 --> 00:27:05.750
So to speak. he says.
Myrrh off. man.

360
00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:09.083
Kids today prefer technology.

361
00:27:09.166 --> 00:27:12.666
not stuff from the past
like myrrh or incense.

362
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.458
That's why I. Santa 2.0.

363
00:27:15.541 --> 00:27:19.750
have decided to reinvent myself
and adapt to the new times.

364
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.041
I present the Santa Watch.

365
00:27:25.083 --> 00:27:28.875
a device not only accurate
to 50 milliseconds

366
00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:30.875
and holographic projection.

367
00:27:30.958 --> 00:27:33.708
but is also linked up to...

368
00:27:34.458 --> 00:27:37.125
my new TULSA sports sleigh.

369
00:27:37.208 --> 00:27:40.166
100% electric and long-range.

370
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.375
And with my new friends.

371
00:27:42.458 --> 00:27:45.333
no more going down
filthy chimneys.

372
00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:49.000
Getting dirty every year
and covered in soot

373
00:27:49.083 --> 00:27:50.333
is a thing of the past.

374
00:27:50.416 --> 00:27:53.125
Now they'll do
the dirty work for me

375
00:27:53.208 --> 00:27:55.208
and these flying gadgets...

376
00:27:56.958 --> 00:27:58.041
don't complain.

377
00:28:00.416 --> 00:28:02.708
I've also decided to stop
living in Lapland

378
00:28:02.791 --> 00:28:05.875
and I've moved to this new castle.

379
00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:08.500
for the sole and indisputable
King of Christmas!

380
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:10.416
King?

381
00:28:10.833 --> 00:28:12.208
Tell me he didn't say "king".

382
00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:14.125
Yes. yes. he said it. he said it.

383
00:28:14.208 --> 00:28:15.833
But that's not all.

384
00:28:16.583 --> 00:28:20.458
I am so happy. so proud. so excited...

385
00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:24.541
to share this with you today.

386
00:28:26.416 --> 00:28:29.791
It's a new chapter
in the history of Christmas.

387
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.125
The future.

388
00:28:36.666 --> 00:28:38.958
No way. he's "overstepped
the manger" now.

389
00:28:39.041 --> 00:28:40.166
Who does he think he is?

390
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.208
He's a dummy
designed to sell soft drinks.

391
00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:44.958
Relax. buddy.

392
00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:46.916
All we have to do is ignore him.

393
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.583
He's got his public
and we have ours.

394
00:28:49.666 --> 00:28:53.625
We needn't make pointless comparisons
or personal slights.

395
00:28:54.291 --> 00:28:57.791
-I'll have my own parade!
-What the hell is fatso on about?!

396
00:28:57.875 --> 00:29:00.291
Did you hear him? Did you?

397
00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:05.625
Dance. Elf 1. Be happy.

398
00:29:05.708 --> 00:29:08.958
Objection!
I feel forced to interrupt

399
00:29:09.041 --> 00:29:11.583
this santaclaustic exhibition of ego.

400
00:29:12.041 --> 00:29:14.875
The parade has always been ours.

401
00:29:14.958 --> 00:29:16.166
the Magi.

402
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.416
Not for nothing
is it Christmas' most magical night.

403
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.625
Bear it in mind. bear it in mind.

404
00:29:21.708 --> 00:29:24.333
Yes. whatever you say.
but Chancellor.

405
00:29:25.833 --> 00:29:29.916
shouldn't we revise
the bases of this committee?

406
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.916
That's ridiculous!

407
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.250
Bro. chill.

408
00:29:33.333 --> 00:29:36.208
Ridiculous is bringing presents
on January 6th.

409
00:29:36.291 --> 00:29:37.958
That's not Christmas. CUBMOB.

410
00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:39.333
Did he call me "bro"?

411
00:29:39.416 --> 00:29:41.625
The poor kids barely have
time to play

412
00:29:41.708 --> 00:29:44.500
because two days later
they go back to school.

413
00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:46.208
They go back to school. come on!

414
00:29:46.291 --> 00:29:49.458
Chancellor. are you really going
to allow this takeover?

415
00:29:49.791 --> 00:29:52.291
What do you think of a vote?

416
00:29:54.208 --> 00:29:57.083
I think it's neither bad nor good.

417
00:29:57.583 --> 00:30:00.875
Those in favor of Santa's parade?

418
00:30:04.625 --> 00:30:07.458
Hey. relax. I'm sorting it out.

419
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:10.500
Sorting out what?
Sneaking off? Lay off. man.

420
00:30:10.583 --> 00:30:12.875
He got his own way in the end.
he beat us.

421
00:30:12.958 --> 00:30:14.250
Beat us? Who?

422
00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:17.125
This year Caca Claus
is holding the parade!

423
00:30:17.208 --> 00:30:19.791
Santa stole our parade?

424
00:30:19.875 --> 00:30:21.208
What did I tell you?

425
00:30:21.291 --> 00:30:23.416
Plus he has the support
of all of CUBMOB.

426
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.875
This is unbelievable.

427
00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:26.750
Fine. he encroaches on us every year.

428
00:30:26.833 --> 00:30:30.083
but taking what's ours...
What is this?

429
00:30:31.041 --> 00:30:34.250
Hey. didn't you realize that
I wasn't in there with you?

430
00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:35.333
What?

431
00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.166
The children forgetting me hurts.

432
00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:40.708
but my best friends
forgetting me too. really. guys...

433
00:30:40.791 --> 00:30:41.750
Hey!

434
00:30:42.708 --> 00:30:46.625
The Three Kings of Methuselah!

435
00:30:52.541 --> 00:30:55.500
Did you like my parade thing?
Any suggestions?

436
00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:58.875
Look. Santa. I'm in no mood
for your shit. okay?

437
00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:02.041
Shit?
What kind of language is that?

438
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.000
What would the children say
if they heard you?

439
00:31:05.583 --> 00:31:09.208
They'd say: "Mom. who's that?"

440
00:31:11.791 --> 00:31:14.208
I'm King Caspar.

441
00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:17.000
I'm King Crapster.

442
00:31:19.958 --> 00:31:21.416
Let it go. let it go.

443
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.458
-King Caspar.
-Who?

444
00:31:24.541 --> 00:31:28.208
I'm saying I'm King Caspar.

445
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.750
And I say: Who cares?

446
00:31:33.125 --> 00:31:36.333
-Caspar. come on. let's go.
-Ignore him. let's go.

447
00:31:49.333 --> 00:31:55.083
The road to Bethlehem

448
00:31:57.416 --> 00:32:02.791
goes down the valley
that the snow covered

449
00:32:05.166 --> 00:32:11.000
The little shepherds
want to see their king.

450
00:32:13.291 --> 00:32:17.791
they bring him gifts
in their humble shepherd's pouch.

451
00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:29.666
He was born in a stable
in Bethlehem.

452
00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:35.041
the Baby Jesus.

453
00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:46.541
I wish to place at your feet

454
00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:54.333
a present to your liking. Lord.

455
00:32:56.416 --> 00:33:01.750
You know I am poor as well

456
00:33:04.208 --> 00:33:09.166
and have only an old drum.

457
00:33:10.333 --> 00:33:11.208
Enough!

458
00:33:16.916 --> 00:33:20.166
I said enough!

459
00:33:28.666 --> 00:33:32.291
Don't you know
what you could awaken?

460
00:33:36.416 --> 00:33:37.916
According to the legend.

461
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.250
the Krampus was an evil being who.
for a long time.

462
00:33:42.333 --> 00:33:45.750
stalked boys and girls
all over the world at Christmas.

463
00:33:46.083 --> 00:33:48.958
until one day he was defeated.

464
00:33:49.041 --> 00:33:52.416
They say that that day
he lost all his powers

465
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.625
and his body vanished
into thin air.

466
00:33:55.708 --> 00:33:59.083
although a small part of him
managed to survive:

467
00:34:00.958 --> 00:34:02.666
His shadow!

468
00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:07.833
These days. he's still somewhere.

469
00:34:07.916 --> 00:34:10.000
asleep under the power of Christmas.

470
00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:13.541
too weak to awaken.

471
00:34:16.333 --> 00:34:20.458
But if. one day.
the Christmas spirit withers.

472
00:34:21.125 --> 00:34:24.625
Krampus' shadow will awaken
from its forced lethargy

473
00:34:24.958 --> 00:34:29.375
and attempt by any means
to end Christmas forever.

474
00:34:30.083 --> 00:34:34.250
for only this way will he recover
his original body and all his powers.

475
00:34:39.208 --> 00:34:41.125
His shadow will roam the streets.

476
00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:46.583
seeking the perfect person to possess.

477
00:34:52.208 --> 00:34:55.166
What are you still doing here. Marquitos?

478
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:59.208
Go home. this is the time
to spend with the family.

479
00:34:59.291 --> 00:35:02.125
I appreciate it. Mayor.

480
00:35:05.291 --> 00:35:07.916
-Merry Christmas.
-Same to you.

481
00:35:10.458 --> 00:35:14.583
And Marquitos. don't forget
to give Esther a kiss from me.

482
00:35:33.416 --> 00:35:35.166
Are you alright. Mayor?

483
00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:41.958
Better than ever.

484
00:35:45.208 --> 00:35:47.208
And the only way
to do away with him

485
00:35:47.291 --> 00:35:51.041
will be to pierce his heart
with the original Christmas Star.

486
00:35:51.125 --> 00:35:54.416
an immensely powerful relic.

487
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.625
What's all this about?

488
00:35:55.708 --> 00:35:58.458
You said you don't believe
in this stuff. right?

489
00:35:58.541 --> 00:36:02.458
But you do and I like scaring you
because you're a chicken.

490
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.291
I'm not a chicken!

491
00:36:07.708 --> 00:36:09.875
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

492
00:36:10.416 --> 00:36:14.250
This is CUBMOB.
you are CUBMOB.

493
00:36:15.666 --> 00:36:17.875
and if you want to stay CUBMOB.

494
00:36:18.416 --> 00:36:21.625
you have to act like CUBMOB. got it?

495
00:36:22.541 --> 00:36:24.833
-It's not fair!
-But he started it!

496
00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:26.625
You always let him
do whatever he wants.

497
00:36:26.708 --> 00:36:29.541
-Do you doubt my impartiality?
-I think he did.

498
00:36:30.208 --> 00:36:32.791
-Why don't you shut up?
-Everyone shut up!

499
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.750
I suggest you leave here right now.

500
00:36:37.833 --> 00:36:41.833
Because anything you may say
or do from now on

501
00:36:41.916 --> 00:36:43.833
will only worsen your situation.

502
00:36:51.958 --> 00:36:55.666
By the way. my dear Kings.
a question before you go.

503
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:58.583
What do you think
I should throw from my float?

504
00:36:58.666 --> 00:37:00.083
Chocolates.

505
00:37:00.166 --> 00:37:04.375
or giant candy that injures
the kids like you do?

506
00:37:04.458 --> 00:37:07.750
You'll pay for this.
you lowdown ass. you hear?

507
00:37:08.458 --> 00:37:10.416
I swear to you. this isn't over.

508
00:37:10.833 --> 00:37:12.291
Silence!

509
00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.666
Get out of here!

510
00:37:41.041 --> 00:37:43.416
Christmas is the best time of year.

511
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.000
Right. my tiny friend. Elf 1?

512
00:37:52.416 --> 00:37:55.000
Yeah. I love Christmas.

513
00:38:00.791 --> 00:38:03.333
Elf.

514
00:38:04.416 --> 00:38:07.000
come to me!

515
00:38:09.375 --> 00:38:10.500
What was that voice?

516
00:38:10.583 --> 00:38:11.791
What voice?

517
00:38:12.916 --> 00:38:14.166
What are you talking about?

518
00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.375
You must be tired.

519
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.708
Go and rest. little slacker.

520
00:38:24.416 --> 00:38:29.083
I know you hate Christmas
as much as I do.

521
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.750
Help me and we'll destroy it together.

522
00:38:34.291 --> 00:38:38.250
I don't understand. I thought
you magical beings got along.

523
00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:40.041
No. we get along.

524
00:38:40.458 --> 00:38:44.541
but this darn Santa has been
sowing discord for centuries.

525
00:38:44.625 --> 00:38:48.291
Normally we don't behave like this.
Right. Caspar?

526
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.416
Yeah.

527
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.875
Whatever you say.

528
00:38:56.208 --> 00:38:57.625
Good night.

529
00:39:02.458 --> 00:39:04.333
Rudolph. music.

530
00:39:04.416 --> 00:39:05.625
Activating music.

531
00:39:05.708 --> 00:39:09.750
Mayor. I'm thrilled to present
my parade project to you.

532
00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:12.333
I think if we hurry.

533
00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:15.625
my elves can have it all ready
by tomorrow. the 25th.

534
00:39:15.708 --> 00:39:17.500
I want it to be a daytime parade

535
00:39:17.583 --> 00:39:20.708
so that the boys and girls
can enjoy their gifts

536
00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:24.625
while their parents have
a vermouth. a little tequila...

537
00:39:24.708 --> 00:39:28.083
I want it to be a parade
in grand style because...

538
00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:34.208
Rudolph. music.

539
00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:39.500
Rudolph. music!

540
00:39:41.875 --> 00:39:43.250
Rudolph. music!

541
00:39:43.333 --> 00:39:44.916
Closing curtains.

542
00:39:47.541 --> 00:39:48.916
What's he doing?

543
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.291
Rudolph. open the curtains
and put on some music!

544
00:39:53.208 --> 00:39:56.250
I'm sorry.
this normally doesn't happen to us.

545
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:04.916
Surprise.

546
00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:27.708
DECEMBER 24TH. CHRISTMAS EVE

547
00:40:45.708 --> 00:40:47.833
It looks like singing
isn't one of her talents.

548
00:40:47.916 --> 00:40:49.125
No. not really. no.

549
00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:52.291
Listen.

550
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:56.750
do you think Caspar's upset about
what happened at the CUBMOB?

551
00:40:56.833 --> 00:40:58.666
Among other things.

552
00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:02.000
We must understand him.

553
00:41:08.708 --> 00:41:10.958
Aren't you going out partying
with Paco and Oriol?

554
00:41:11.708 --> 00:41:13.125
I don't feel like it.

555
00:41:15.041 --> 00:41:16.125
What a shame.

556
00:41:18.541 --> 00:41:20.041
Because...

557
00:41:21.458 --> 00:41:23.791
I feel like dancing.

558
00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.791
Look. Balta.

559
00:41:31.875 --> 00:41:35.125
we've been doing this
for over 2000 years.

560
00:41:35.875 --> 00:41:38.041
We are and will be Kings forever.

561
00:41:38.125 --> 00:41:40.291
-for better...
-Or for worse.

562
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:43.333
Don't worry. old friend.

563
00:41:44.291 --> 00:41:45.625
He'll get over it.

564
00:41:46.625 --> 00:41:48.083
I hope so.

565
00:41:51.416 --> 00:41:53.125
We have a problem.

566
00:42:45.375 --> 00:42:47.583
Do you still think
that magic doesn't exist?

567
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:50.791
We're going to stay up all night

568
00:42:50.875 --> 00:42:53.708
so we can see Santa
when he brings the presents.

569
00:42:53.791 --> 00:42:54.916
Are you crazy or what?

570
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.250
What is it? Oh. I know.

571
00:42:57.333 --> 00:43:00.041
You're scared that I'm right
and you're not. true?

572
00:43:34.625 --> 00:43:37.333
Do you feel like... a drink?

573
00:43:39.041 --> 00:43:39.875
Yes.

574
00:43:43.333 --> 00:43:45.041
I'll be right back.

575
00:43:50.416 --> 00:43:52.166
Don't move.

576
00:44:06.583 --> 00:44:07.458
Caspar...

577
00:44:09.375 --> 00:44:11.833
We've come for you.
We're wanted in the magical world.

578
00:44:11.916 --> 00:44:14.458
What?
Can't it be in a little while?

579
00:44:14.541 --> 00:44:17.041
No. Code Red. Let's go.

580
00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:18.583
Code Red.

581
00:44:30.708 --> 00:44:32.416
Listen. Felipe...

582
00:44:33.875 --> 00:44:36.208
Do you like tonic?

583
00:44:44.833 --> 00:44:46.666
Ask your king.

584
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.333
What's that about our king?

585
00:44:48.416 --> 00:44:50.500
Hey. don't point. don't point.

586
00:44:50.583 --> 00:44:52.416
Calm!

587
00:44:53.291 --> 00:44:54.541
Calm.

588
00:44:59.125 --> 00:45:00.875
We all agree

589
00:45:00.958 --> 00:45:03.541
that it's slightly worrying

590
00:45:03.625 --> 00:45:06.083
that Santa Claus is untraceable.

591
00:45:06.166 --> 00:45:08.333
this being Christmas Eve.

592
00:45:11.458 --> 00:45:13.250
Do you know anything?

593
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000
No.

594
00:45:15.083 --> 00:45:16.541
-Sure?
-Sure.

595
00:45:17.291 --> 00:45:18.750
Excuse me. Chancellor.

596
00:45:19.166 --> 00:45:21.750
did you summon us because
you think we're involved?

597
00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:22.750
-Yes.
-Yes.

598
00:45:22.833 --> 00:45:23.833
Yes?

599
00:45:23.916 --> 00:45:25.416
No.

600
00:45:26.916 --> 00:45:29.375
I summoned you because tonight

601
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:32.166
is the most magical night
of Christmas.

602
00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:35.416
All the boys and girls in the world

603
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.916
are waiting for
the arrival of Santa Claus.

604
00:45:39.791 --> 00:45:43.083
But if tomorrow they discover
that he hasn't come.

605
00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:47.541
it would put in grave danger
the Christmas spirit

606
00:45:47.625 --> 00:45:49.208
and all of you.

607
00:45:53.541 --> 00:45:55.291
Someone has to deliver his presents.

608
00:45:58.041 --> 00:45:59.791
You're not working tonight.

609
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.708
-Excuse me. Chancellor. but we can...
-No!

610
00:46:04.833 --> 00:46:07.708
You'll do it just like Santa.
understood?

611
00:46:07.791 --> 00:46:09.083
Yes. ma'am.

612
00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:10.250
Hey. not this.

613
00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:13.333
Why on earth would we stoop
to something like this?

614
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.416
Why on earth? Because tomorrow.

615
00:46:18.875 --> 00:46:20.375
when the sun comes up

616
00:46:20.458 --> 00:46:22.916
and the children don't find

617
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.250
Santa Claus' presents
under the tree.

618
00:46:27.041 --> 00:46:29.458
you will be immediately

619
00:46:29.541 --> 00:46:31.500
and permanently expelled
from CUBMOB.

620
00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:35.541
Oh. that's why.

621
00:46:35.625 --> 00:46:37.333
Okay. okay. Right then.

622
00:46:37.416 --> 00:46:39.833
When things are made clear...

623
00:46:39.916 --> 00:46:41.500
Crystal clear.

624
00:46:59.041 --> 00:47:01.500
Where am I? Where am I?

625
00:47:02.166 --> 00:47:03.083
Help!

626
00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:07.416
Someone help me. I'm Santa!

627
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.500
What is this?

628
00:47:10.083 --> 00:47:12.083
Help. please!

629
00:47:25.416 --> 00:47:26.583
Krampus.

630
00:47:27.166 --> 00:47:28.958
I see that. despite everything.

631
00:47:29.041 --> 00:47:31.458
you haven't forgotten me. old friend.

632
00:47:32.791 --> 00:47:35.458
Krampus. it's Christmas.
the children await their presents.

633
00:47:35.541 --> 00:47:37.125
Please. what do you want?

634
00:47:37.208 --> 00:47:39.416
Tell me. what do you want?

635
00:47:40.125 --> 00:47:42.208
You know very well.

636
00:47:43.041 --> 00:47:45.541
You people did this to me.

637
00:47:47.416 --> 00:47:50.333
You took away my powers
and my body.

638
00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:53.875
When I do away with Christmas forever.

639
00:47:55.041 --> 00:47:58.458
I'll recover my original body
and all my powers.

640
00:47:58.541 --> 00:48:01.958
then no boy or girl in the world

641
00:48:02.708 --> 00:48:04.875
will ever be safe from me again.

642
00:48:04.958 --> 00:48:07.208
You won't get away with it. Krampus.

643
00:48:08.041 --> 00:48:10.458
You think by kidnapping me
you'll do away with Christmas?

644
00:48:10.541 --> 00:48:11.458
That won't happen.

645
00:48:11.541 --> 00:48:12.666
No!

646
00:48:12.916 --> 00:48:15.625
That won't be enough.

647
00:48:16.208 --> 00:48:20.791
But when the boys and girls
wake up tomorrow

648
00:48:20.875 --> 00:48:24.250
and see that Santa hasn't come.

649
00:48:24.875 --> 00:48:29.708
I'll be closer to
accomplishing my aim.

650
00:48:31.916 --> 00:48:33.041
Nice try.

651
00:48:33.708 --> 00:48:38.208
but there's no signal here
for your modern gadget.

652
00:48:39.875 --> 00:48:42.208
There's nothing you can do.

653
00:49:03.833 --> 00:49:05.083
Friends.

654
00:49:05.541 --> 00:49:07.125
I'm sure there's an explanation

655
00:49:07.208 --> 00:49:10.458
as to why Santa has deserted us
at the worst possible time.

656
00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:13.958
No. don't cry.

657
00:49:14.041 --> 00:49:15.125
No.

658
00:49:15.958 --> 00:49:17.541
While we find out.

659
00:49:19.583 --> 00:49:24.000
we must settle for these three dorks
endorsed by the Commission.

660
00:49:27.375 --> 00:49:29.500
Excuse me. reindeer-groomer.

661
00:49:29.583 --> 00:49:34.166
but we Magi were delivering gifts
long before this Santa Claws.

662
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:36.291
It's a piece of cake for us.

663
00:49:36.375 --> 00:49:40.666
Yes. but is it really necessary
for us to dress like jackasses?

664
00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:43.291
How do I explain this?

665
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:48.291
The children are expecting Santa.
so Santa will give them their gifts.

666
00:49:48.375 --> 00:49:51.333
And shake a leg. eh?
It's barely an hour until sunrise.

667
00:49:52.916 --> 00:49:54.541
Hold it right there.

668
00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:56.250
Pump your brakes.

669
00:49:56.625 --> 00:50:00.375
There's plenty of time.
but only if we do it our way.

670
00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:03.416
Okay.

671
00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.666
Okay. okay.

672
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.625
Friends. it's time to hand out presents.

673
00:50:49.333 --> 00:50:50.375
Let's go.

674
00:50:50.458 --> 00:50:51.375
Stop!

675
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.291
Wow. the ladder!

676
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:00.333
You're kidding. right?

677
00:51:00.416 --> 00:51:03.333
You hold onto it.
Watch and learn.

678
00:51:05.208 --> 00:51:07.333
You'll spend half your lives
handing out presents.

679
00:51:08.041 --> 00:51:10.375
Whatever it takes.
Can't you see we've stopped time?

680
00:51:10.458 --> 00:51:13.333
Could time be turned back
with your method?

681
00:51:13.416 --> 00:51:15.250
It could.
But we don't feel like it.

682
00:51:15.333 --> 00:51:16.583
It'd be very dangerous.

683
00:51:16.666 --> 00:51:18.833
The consequences
could be catastrophic.

684
00:51:18.916 --> 00:51:22.541
We'd face a terrible paradox capable
of causing such a chain reaction

685
00:51:22.625 --> 00:51:24.958
that it would reformulate
the space-time continuum.

686
00:51:48.875 --> 00:51:50.916
Jesus. Mary and Joseph.

687
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.750
I'm so tanked!

688
00:51:53.041 --> 00:51:55.875
This mania for putting out
alcohol in the house!

689
00:51:55.958 --> 00:51:58.000
I'm just being polite. got it?

690
00:51:58.083 --> 00:52:00.250
You have to understand me too.

691
00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:16.625
What's going on?

692
00:52:17.625 --> 00:52:19.291
Is this normal?

693
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.541
-No.
-It's weird.

694
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Let's get out of here.

695
00:52:24.083 --> 00:52:26.250
Now we're really in a jam.

696
00:52:33.541 --> 00:52:35.041
Bugger it.

697
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.416
DECEMBER 25. CHRISTMAS

698
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.041
It's daytime.

699
00:52:44.375 --> 00:52:46.625
Do you still expect Santa to come?

700
00:52:50.708 --> 00:52:52.125
You'll see that he came!

701
00:53:07.125 --> 00:53:08.625
I told you.

702
00:53:09.208 --> 00:53:10.958
Magic doesn't exist.

703
00:53:11.666 --> 00:53:12.666
But it has to...

704
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:14.333
No. okay?

705
00:53:14.416 --> 00:53:15.583
Cut it out.

706
00:53:21.250 --> 00:53:24.500
How could you fail in your mission?

707
00:53:25.375 --> 00:53:28.583
You just had to do what
you've done for 2000 years.

708
00:53:28.666 --> 00:53:31.250
Something or someone
sabotaged us.

709
00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:32.875
We don't know.

710
00:53:33.333 --> 00:53:34.750
I do know.

711
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:38.083
This witch thinks
this is no accident.

712
00:53:39.125 --> 00:53:43.458
She thinks you're responsible
for Santa's disappearance.

713
00:53:45.125 --> 00:53:47.083
-It's true. it's true.
-They hit him!

714
00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:48.791
Thugs!

715
00:53:49.625 --> 00:53:51.541
They've always been jealous of him!

716
00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.875
Every magical being knows it. eh?

717
00:53:56.666 --> 00:53:58.875
-Thugs. thugs!
-Hold on a moment!

718
00:53:59.291 --> 00:54:03.875
You don't think we'd be capable
of doing something like this?

719
00:54:05.833 --> 00:54:07.458
Yes. it had to be them.

720
00:54:07.541 --> 00:54:09.125
Of course it was them.

721
00:54:11.166 --> 00:54:13.791
-Right?
-I don't believe anything.

722
00:54:14.125 --> 00:54:16.958
Not one side or the other.

723
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:19.916
Dear companions...

724
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.416
Alright...

725
00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:23.416
Why would we do
something like this?

726
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.958
For a long time
you've found him unbearable.

727
00:54:26.291 --> 00:54:30.000
You told me yourself one day that
you were sick of cultural invasion.

728
00:54:30.083 --> 00:54:32.250
You couldn't bear it
that boys and girls

729
00:54:32.333 --> 00:54:35.208
prefer to write to Santa than you.

730
00:54:35.291 --> 00:54:38.166
So you made him disappear!

731
00:54:40.333 --> 00:54:43.458
Never. ever. have I seen anything
like this in CUBMOB!

732
00:54:43.541 --> 00:54:46.291
Betrayal! I said betrayal!

733
00:54:46.375 --> 00:54:49.375
Betrayal! Betrayal!

734
00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:51.083
Betrayal!

735
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:58.166
You've enormously weakened
the Christmas spirit.

736
00:54:59.708 --> 00:55:03.416
We all know how dangerous
that could be.

737
00:55:04.041 --> 00:55:09.125
The terrible consequences
that this could mean if...

738
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.416
-I've no choice but to expel...
-Chancellor!

739
00:55:26.833 --> 00:55:29.791
Perhaps we should remind
those present here

740
00:55:29.875 --> 00:55:31.666
of Principio Indubidus Pronatale.

741
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:34.750
included in article 11.3
of the Christmas Accord.

742
00:55:35.166 --> 00:55:38.541
Perhaps not everyone is as aware
of it as you and I.

743
00:55:40.666 --> 00:55:41.916
Of course.

744
00:55:42.666 --> 00:55:47.125
But you remind them.
my voice is a little hoarse.

745
00:55:48.958 --> 00:55:51.208
Every defendant has the right
to be presumed innocent

746
00:55:51.291 --> 00:55:53.208
until proven guilty.

747
00:55:53.291 --> 00:55:56.250
and as there is no evidence
of the Kings' guilt.

748
00:55:56.333 --> 00:55:59.416
I assume that CUBMOB will initiate
a large-scale investigation

749
00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:00.666
before passing judgement.

750
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:02.333
Sure. of course.

751
00:56:02.416 --> 00:56:04.791
This girl sure is well trained.

752
00:56:04.875 --> 00:56:06.458
She sure is.

753
00:56:07.625 --> 00:56:08.791
Thank you.

754
00:56:08.875 --> 00:56:11.291
I was just about to say so

755
00:56:11.375 --> 00:56:13.708
before you interrupted me.

756
00:56:14.041 --> 00:56:16.166
I have no choice but to initiate

757
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:19.166
an investigation into what happened.

758
00:56:21.833 --> 00:56:23.375
Mission accomplished.

759
00:56:23.458 --> 00:56:24.708
The Kings have...

760
00:56:27.833 --> 00:56:29.250
They've failed.

761
00:56:33.416 --> 00:56:35.166
Look who's here.

762
00:56:36.125 --> 00:56:38.083
Do you know my elf buddy?

763
00:56:38.416 --> 00:56:39.666
Just kidding.

764
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:41.416
I know you know each other.

765
00:56:42.375 --> 00:56:46.958
He was your friend.
he betrayed you. blah. blah. blah...

766
00:56:48.541 --> 00:56:52.458
I'll leave you now.
you have a lot to talk about.

767
00:56:54.208 --> 00:56:56.375
How could you. Elf 1?

768
00:56:57.041 --> 00:56:58.083
You're my friend.

769
00:56:58.583 --> 00:56:59.833
Your friend?

770
00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:01.791
Don't make me laugh.

771
00:57:02.208 --> 00:57:04.666
You've always treated me
like a slave.

772
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:07.958
And this "Elf 1" thing...
I can't stand it.

773
00:57:08.833 --> 00:57:11.958
But I call you Elf 1
because you're the best.

774
00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:13.666
You're number one!

775
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.125
You've never seen me as a friend.

776
00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:20.500
I mean the same to you
as your crappy drones.

777
00:57:20.583 --> 00:57:24.416
I swear. if I acted like an idiot.
it's because I'm an idiot.

778
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.083
not because I don't
consider you to be my friend.

779
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:30.375
But allying with the Krampus?

780
00:57:31.625 --> 00:57:33.125
What happened to you?

781
00:57:33.833 --> 00:57:36.833
At what point did you abandon
reason for madness?

782
00:57:36.916 --> 00:57:38.916
Madness was working for you.

783
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.875
Krampus treats me as a friend.
as an equal.

784
00:57:42.958 --> 00:57:44.625
We're like Batman and Robin.

785
00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:46.625
Like Timon and Pumba.

786
00:57:46.708 --> 00:57:48.208
Like Will and Fog.

787
00:57:48.875 --> 00:57:49.916
Do you understand?

788
00:57:50.458 --> 00:57:51.750
He respects me.

789
00:57:51.833 --> 00:57:54.000
Smurf. cut the chatter.

790
00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:56.416
Move it. we have work to do!

791
00:57:58.916 --> 00:58:00.000
You see?

792
00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:02.666
We even give each other nicknames.

793
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.333
Where's Simpleton Santa gotten to?

794
00:58:18.416 --> 00:58:20.250
Do you think something bad
has happened to him?

795
00:58:20.333 --> 00:58:24.291
Something bad. to Santa? Please!
Right now he's laughing at us.

796
00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:25.541
How can you be so sure?

797
00:58:25.625 --> 00:58:28.041
Worrying about him
is a waste of time.

798
00:58:28.125 --> 00:58:29.541
We know him.

799
00:58:30.583 --> 00:58:33.083
Go on up. I'll be right there.

800
00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:37.250
Hello.

801
00:58:38.625 --> 00:58:40.375
-Hello.
-Hello.

802
00:58:41.333 --> 00:58:42.833
Where...?

803
00:58:43.625 --> 00:58:45.500
What happened to you?
I was worried.

804
00:58:45.583 --> 00:58:49.958
No. it's all fine.
Something came up and...

805
00:58:50.458 --> 00:58:52.333
It's alright. don't worry.

806
00:58:54.375 --> 00:58:56.208
Well. it looks like...

807
00:58:56.291 --> 00:58:58.375
Christmas this year has gone to hell.

808
00:58:58.458 --> 00:59:01.833
Yes. I heard something. yes.

809
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:05.333
Listen.

810
00:59:06.375 --> 00:59:08.875
can we talk about
what happened last night?

811
00:59:08.958 --> 00:59:10.583
Yes. Look...

812
00:59:12.666 --> 00:59:14.083
I like you.

813
00:59:15.125 --> 00:59:16.375
You like me?

814
00:59:17.041 --> 00:59:20.833
What did Schnegurowska mean
that weakening the Christmas spirit

815
00:59:20.916 --> 00:59:22.708
could have terrible consequences?

816
00:59:22.791 --> 00:59:24.041
You see.

817
00:59:24.583 --> 00:59:28.500
the Christmas spirit is more important
and powerful than you can imagine.

818
00:59:28.875 --> 00:59:31.500
It not only enables the existence
of magical beings.

819
00:59:31.583 --> 00:59:33.833
it also protects the world from evil

820
00:59:33.916 --> 00:59:35.708
and the wicked creatures that.

821
00:59:35.791 --> 00:59:37.666
if Christmas didn't exist.

822
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:40.916
would sow chaos and terror
all over the world.

823
00:59:44.333 --> 00:59:46.791
When our actions aren't exemplary.

824
00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:51.416
the Christmas spirit withers
and our magic along with it.

825
00:59:55.583 --> 00:59:58.958
Do you really think Santa
would run such a huge risk

826
00:59:59.041 --> 01:00:00.375
just to annoy you?

827
01:00:00.458 --> 01:00:02.583
-Yes.
-Are you kidding?

828
01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:05.166
-Would he endanger the Magical World?
-No doubt.

829
01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.958
And the existence
of all the magical beings?

830
01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:07.958
Of course.

831
01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:12.000
And the person he loves most
in the world as well?

832
01:00:12.083 --> 01:00:13.416
Himself. Santa Claus.

833
01:00:13.875 --> 01:00:15.125
Seriously?

834
01:00:17.791 --> 01:00:20.250
You see? We have to find him.

835
01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:22.125
Not only to prove your innocence.

836
01:00:22.208 --> 01:00:24.250
but to save the Christmas spirit.

837
01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:25.416
What could we do?

838
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.750
Not much.

839
01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:28.375
It's frankly impossible.

840
01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.958
Impossible? Are you serious?

841
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:34.250
The same guys who 2000 years ago
crossed a desert

842
01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:36.541
in search of a newborn baby
are the same ones

843
01:00:36.625 --> 01:00:39.125
that now can't find
a bearded man with magical powers

844
01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:40.916
who travels in a sports sleigh?

845
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.416
That wasn't bad at all. eh?

846
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.625
Not bad at all.

847
01:00:48.708 --> 01:00:49.916
-It was mythical.
-Unique.

848
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.041
-Epic.
-Spectacular.

849
01:00:52.125 --> 01:00:53.375
Right then.

850
01:00:54.583 --> 01:00:56.708
Supposing we did it.

851
01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:58.458
we could start by sending

852
01:00:58.541 --> 01:01:01.333
our messenger hawks
to search for clues worldwide.

853
01:01:01.416 --> 01:01:02.500
Good.

854
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:05.583
And if our pages indicate
the clues on a map.

855
01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:07.250
we could find a pattern.

856
01:01:07.333 --> 01:01:10.666
-That's right. Melchior.
-Good. Balthazar. Let's go.

857
01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:15.791
You're the guy I see once a year

858
01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:19.166
for two weeks
and then goes again.

859
01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:22.708
My daughters
are the most important thing for me

860
01:01:23.166 --> 01:01:27.000
and they don't deserve
to let someone in who won't stay

861
01:01:28.041 --> 01:01:31.708
and who always has something
more urgent to do.

862
01:01:32.208 --> 01:01:33.458
But...

863
01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:36.875
Understand me a little too.

864
01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:38.208
Felipe.

865
01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:40.708
Come on. let's go!

866
01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:43.166
Now?

867
01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:44.541
Felipe!

868
01:01:45.666 --> 01:01:46.666
But why now?

869
01:01:47.208 --> 01:01:48.583
It's very urgent.

870
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.541
Guys. as you know.
Santa Claus has disappeared.

871
01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:05.708
We've sent a squadron of hawks
in search of him.

872
01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:09.208
so I need you to look north
and you south. okay?

873
01:02:09.291 --> 01:02:11.291
-Yes. let's go.
-Let's go. guys.

874
01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:13.541
DECEMBER 26

875
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.333
Where?

876
01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:32.583
DECEMBER 28. PARIS

877
01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:45.208
DECEMBER 31. NEW YEAR'S EVE

878
01:02:46.083 --> 01:02:48.708
After the terrible loss of Christmas.

879
01:02:48.791 --> 01:02:51.791
we're now left
without New Year's Eve

880
01:02:51.875 --> 01:02:54.000
due to a strange breakdown
of the clock.

881
01:02:58.541 --> 01:02:59.375
Help!

882
01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:01.583
JANUARY 2. MEXICO CITY

883
01:03:02.833 --> 01:03:06.250
Guide us. Lord. and help us find
damned Caca Claus.

884
01:03:09.958 --> 01:03:12.083
I knew you hadn't abandoned us!

885
01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:14.958
After two millennia
you finally remember us!

886
01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:16.625
Is it Him?

887
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.708
Federal Police!

888
01:03:22.208 --> 01:03:25.333
Throw down your sacks
and get down off the camels!

889
01:03:27.916 --> 01:03:30.666
We've found clues
in all these places.

890
01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:33.000
Tell us. Zambomba.

891
01:03:34.625 --> 01:03:35.708
He says it's here.

892
01:03:35.791 --> 01:03:39.000
TYRRANICAL MONARCHY
KINGS OUT

893
01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:40.666
What's this all about?

894
01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:45.916
JANUARY 4

895
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:52.125
Santa!

896
01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:55.083
Will someone help me?

897
01:03:55.166 --> 01:03:58.333
Christmas is over!

898
01:04:02.166 --> 01:04:03.500
Elf....

899
01:04:05.458 --> 01:04:07.000
help.

900
01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:33.000
King Cake?

901
01:04:34.583 --> 01:04:35.750
Is it you?

902
01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:49.041
SANTA WISHES YOU MERRY CHRISTMAS
ONE IS WORTH THREE

903
01:04:51.875 --> 01:04:53.875
What a fraud.

904
01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:56.916
Another red herring.

905
01:04:57.416 --> 01:04:59.458
"One is worth three".

906
01:04:59.541 --> 01:05:01.208
What a braggart.

907
01:05:01.666 --> 01:05:04.916
I still don't believe CUBMOB said
we hate him because we're jealous.

908
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.583
-Jealous? Of what?
-Of what?

909
01:05:07.416 --> 01:05:10.333
He's a lame duck.
always so annoying.

910
01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:13.583
All he's done is ruin our lives.

911
01:05:13.666 --> 01:05:16.166
I can't bear him one day more.

912
01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:18.041
Poor wretch.

913
01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:21.750
It must be tough being
absolutely no one's favorite.

914
01:05:21.833 --> 01:05:22.791
Nobody.

915
01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:24.000
Don't go overboard.
he has his fans.

916
01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:25.291
A handful.

917
01:05:25.916 --> 01:05:28.500
Besides. because of him
CUBMOB may kick us out.

918
01:05:28.583 --> 01:05:31.250
He started the fight. not us.
Let them kick him out.

919
01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:35.000
Sir. do you have a minute
to help our friends the whales?

920
01:05:35.083 --> 01:05:36.416
Your friends the whales?

921
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.750
Look. I'll tell you something.

922
01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:40.250
Sometimes you think
the whales are your friends.

923
01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:44.125
but watch it. you never know
what they'll say behind your back.

924
01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:51.375
We're jealous of Santa...

925
01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:53.375
It doesn't make a lick of sense.

926
01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:55.458
Envy him. why?

927
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.250
-Because he's world famous?
-Because his sleigh flies?

928
01:05:58.333 --> 01:05:59.750
-Jealous of what?
-Of what?

929
01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:03.916
By the way. the hawks need
an ophthalmologist.

930
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.500
It's odd that they can't tell
a real person from a photo.

931
01:06:14.916 --> 01:06:16.333
Delivering message.

932
01:06:16.416 --> 01:06:18.208
Melchior! Caspar! Balthazar!

933
01:06:18.291 --> 01:06:19.625
The Krampus has awoken!

934
01:06:19.708 --> 01:06:21.041
He's possessed the Mayor

935
01:06:21.125 --> 01:06:23.708
and wants to do away
with Christmas forever!

936
01:06:24.875 --> 01:06:27.833
He's holding me here.
in the Town Hall basement.

937
01:06:27.916 --> 01:06:29.000
Sofía!

938
01:06:29.083 --> 01:06:31.416
There's no time! Come on. Kings!

939
01:06:31.791 --> 01:06:33.208
Can you come?

940
01:06:33.291 --> 01:06:34.416
Melchior! Caspar!

941
01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:35.500
What do you want?

942
01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:36.875
The Krampus has awoken!

943
01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:38.583
Santa's come!

944
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.541
He's in the living room!

945
01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:42.625
What are you saying?

946
01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:45.958
Making things up. really.
you're such a pest!

947
01:06:46.208 --> 01:06:48.291
There's no time! Come on. Kings!

948
01:06:50.708 --> 01:06:52.458
Melchior! Caspar! Balthazar!

949
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:54.000
The Krampus has awoken!

950
01:06:54.083 --> 01:06:55.416
He's possessed the Mayor

951
01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.291
and wants to do away
with Christmas forever!

952
01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:02.250
Hurry. he's getting away!

953
01:07:02.708 --> 01:07:03.708
Where's Mom?

954
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:05.166
Forget about Mom now.

955
01:07:05.666 --> 01:07:08.375
Look. there he is!
Hurry. he's getting away!

956
01:07:10.666 --> 01:07:13.500
-Hurry. he's getting away!
-I'm doing my best. okay OK?

957
01:07:13.583 --> 01:07:15.208
Bea. that way. hurry!

958
01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:20.750
I told you magic exists!

959
01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:25.750
Belén?

960
01:07:30.041 --> 01:07:31.125
Belén?

961
01:07:37.083 --> 01:07:38.166
Belén!

962
01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:41.500
What's wrong?

963
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:44.291
-Tell me.
-Belén...

964
01:07:46.083 --> 01:07:48.625
I've decided I want to stay here.

965
01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:50.458
No more emergencies.

966
01:07:51.625 --> 01:07:53.041
I want...

967
01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.166
to stay here with you.
and with the girls.

968
01:07:56.833 --> 01:07:57.916
Belén.

969
01:07:58.291 --> 01:07:59.875
this is my place.

970
01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:05.375
I'm sorry.

971
01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:07.916
I have to go.

972
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.375
Why? What's wrong?

973
01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:11.708
The girls aren't here.

974
01:08:11.791 --> 01:08:12.875
-But...
-They're not here.

975
01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.125
-OK...
-I don't know where they are.

976
01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:16.625
OK. I'll go with you.
Relax. OK?

977
01:08:19.166 --> 01:08:20.916
Melchior! Caspar! Balthazar!

978
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.375
The Krampus has awoken!

979
01:08:22.458 --> 01:08:23.625
He's possessed the Mayor

980
01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:26.375
and wants to do away
with Christmas forever!

981
01:08:26.458 --> 01:08:27.416
There he is.

982
01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.208
He's holding me here. in the...

983
01:08:29.291 --> 01:08:30.458
One...

984
01:08:30.541 --> 01:08:32.583
-There's no time!
-Two...

985
01:08:32.666 --> 01:08:33.958
Come on. Kings!

986
01:08:35.375 --> 01:08:36.250
Now!

987
01:08:38.083 --> 01:08:39.458
He got away!

988
01:08:39.875 --> 01:08:42.750
What do we do now?
Santa needs our help.

989
01:08:45.166 --> 01:08:48.541
He's holding me here.
in the Town Hall basement.

990
01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:51.250
There's no time! Come on. Kings!

991
01:08:54.666 --> 01:08:56.000
And he'll get it.

992
01:08:56.083 --> 01:08:58.791
-Where did this man get to?
-I don't know.

993
01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:01.708
-He can't have gone forever. right?
-No.

994
01:09:01.791 --> 01:09:03.875
-Really?
-I'm calling Belén.

995
01:09:04.458 --> 01:09:06.875
Hi. Belén. how are you?
Sorry. I wanted to know if...

996
01:09:08.333 --> 01:09:09.375
What?

997
01:09:09.458 --> 01:09:11.208
She says that Bea and Sofía
have run off. she doesn't know...

998
01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:12.833
-Mom!
-We're here.

999
01:09:13.291 --> 01:09:14.875
Belén. relax. they're here.

1000
01:09:14.958 --> 01:09:17.625
Don't worry. we'll stay
with them until you get here.

1001
01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:20.958
We saw Santa. the Krampus
is holding him in his basement.

1002
01:09:21.041 --> 01:09:24.125
He needs help from the Three Kings
to save Christmas.

1003
01:09:24.208 --> 01:09:28.125
You girls sure have
a vivid imagination. eh?

1004
01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:36.250
Melchior! Caspar! Balthazar!
The Krampus has awoken!

1005
01:09:36.333 --> 01:09:37.833
He's possessed the Mayor

1006
01:09:37.916 --> 01:09:40.583
and wants to do away
with Christmas forever!

1007
01:09:41.458 --> 01:09:44.958
He's holding me here.
in the Town Hall basement.

1008
01:09:45.041 --> 01:09:48.125
There's no time! Come on. Kings!

1009
01:09:52.166 --> 01:09:55.750
Shit. I can't believe I'm asking
those three for help.

1010
01:09:57.041 --> 01:09:58.458
Is it still recording?

1011
01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:03.333
They're right.

1012
01:10:04.916 --> 01:10:06.333
The Krampus.

1013
01:10:07.208 --> 01:10:08.375
He's back.

1014
01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:12.166
Ana. stay with the girls
until Belén gets back.

1015
01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:16.125
-Melchior. there's no time to lose.
-What did you just say?

1016
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.291
There's no time to lose.

1017
01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:22.458
No. no. you called him Melchior.

1018
01:10:22.541 --> 01:10:24.250
-No. no.
-No.

1019
01:10:24.666 --> 01:10:26.166
-So you're Balthazar...
-No. no.

1020
01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:28.416
-And Felipe is Caspar.
-No!

1021
01:10:30.416 --> 01:10:32.416
They're the Three Kings!

1022
01:10:34.291 --> 01:10:36.708
-Goodbye to 2000 years of mystery.
-Incredible!

1023
01:10:36.791 --> 01:10:39.500
And they say you're the smartest
of the three of us. Go on. go.

1024
01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:44.625
-If Caspar comes back...
-I'll tell him. yes.

1025
01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:45.958
Good luck.

1026
01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:47.708
And you. girls...

1027
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:51.916
Come on.

1028
01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.875
They're the Three Kings!

1029
01:11:11.041 --> 01:11:12.875
Christmas beings.

1030
01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:17.916
the news is terrible.

1031
01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:23.291
The Christmas spirit is dying.

1032
01:11:25.791 --> 01:11:27.583
We don't have much time left.

1033
01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:30.541
MYTHS OF THE KRAMPUS

1034
01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.166
Here it says that the only way
to get rid of the Krampus

1035
01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:37.000
is to pierce his heart with
the original Christmas Star.

1036
01:11:38.375 --> 01:11:39.708
We have to find it.

1037
01:11:39.791 --> 01:11:42.125
How? Do you know where
the Star is?

1038
01:11:42.208 --> 01:11:43.208
Well...

1039
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:47.708
The original Christmas Star
is found in the Magical World.

1040
01:11:47.791 --> 01:11:51.291
Number 11/2. CUBMOB Palace St.

1041
01:11:52.458 --> 01:11:54.708
And can you take us there?

1042
01:11:54.791 --> 01:11:58.208
Access is restricted.
I'm not authorized for that.

1043
01:11:58.291 --> 01:12:00.666
Sure. the questions you ask...

1044
01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:04.083
If it's a mere watch.
how could it?

1045
01:12:04.166 --> 01:12:06.041
I'm not a mere watch.

1046
01:12:06.125 --> 01:12:09.166
If I wanted.
I could do it perfectly well.

1047
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.958
I'll show you.

1048
01:12:11.041 --> 01:12:12.708
Activating sleigh.

1049
01:12:26.958 --> 01:12:29.208
No Kings gifts for them this year.

1050
01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:33.500
Relax. Belén. They're
in their room. safe and sound.

1051
01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:34.750
No need to worry.

1052
01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:36.291
There we go!

1053
01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.291
Surprise!

1054
01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:46.875
-What's happening?
-No idea.

1055
01:12:47.583 --> 01:12:49.750
I'm as surprised as you are.

1056
01:12:53.541 --> 01:12:56.458
Well. I think
we only have one option.

1057
01:12:58.166 --> 01:13:00.125
-Let's go.
-Go ahead.

1058
01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:02.875
I hope Caspar's not around
anyone who knows him.

1059
01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:05.708
JANUARY 5. TWELFTH NIGHT

1060
01:13:05.791 --> 01:13:07.875
I swear I know nothing about this.

1061
01:13:14.708 --> 01:13:17.125
Well. hey...

1062
01:13:17.791 --> 01:13:19.125
Maybe...

1063
01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:21.583
I do know something.

1064
01:13:21.666 --> 01:13:25.500
The Kings are coming

1065
01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:30.208
with the gift.

1066
01:13:31.208 --> 01:13:35.125
they bring the child

1067
01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:40.208
such lovely presents.

1068
01:13:45.958 --> 01:13:48.125
The Mayor is expecting you.

1069
01:13:49.666 --> 01:13:50.500
What?

1070
01:14:01.208 --> 01:14:02.291
Jeez!

1071
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.750
And the other one?

1072
01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.916
Never mind.

1073
01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:13.125
Welcome. Kings.

1074
01:14:27.291 --> 01:14:30.625
Where has that sleigh
taken my daughters

1075
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.666
and why are you dressed like that?

1076
01:14:33.125 --> 01:14:36.208
It's a long story. but I'm sure
they're fine. don't worry.

1077
01:14:36.291 --> 01:14:38.583
I'm sure it's all fine.
I'll go for the girls...

1078
01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:40.208
No!
You're not going anywhere.

1079
01:14:40.291 --> 01:14:41.250
Sorry?

1080
01:14:41.333 --> 01:14:44.041
You're going with Melchior
and Balthazar. they need your help.

1081
01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:45.708
No way. Let them handle it alone.

1082
01:14:46.291 --> 01:14:48.125
Did she say Melchior and Balthazar?

1083
01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:49.583
-Yes.
-What's wrong with you?

1084
01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:51.958
How can you say that? They're your
best friends and they need you!

1085
01:14:52.041 --> 01:14:55.083
Friends? Friends don't laugh at you
and call you sad and pathetic.

1086
01:14:55.166 --> 01:14:56.375
Who said that about you?

1087
01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:59.208
My supposed best friends!
Melchior. Balthazar and their new friend!

1088
01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:02.375
-So you're...?
-Yes.

1089
01:15:02.458 --> 01:15:04.125
Hey. one thing...

1090
01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:05.208
Just a sec. Belén.

1091
01:15:05.291 --> 01:15:07.750
-When did we say that?
-At the service station.

1092
01:15:07.833 --> 01:15:09.666
What? Don't pretend.
I heard it perfectly.

1093
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:11.291
-The service station?
-Yes. the service station.

1094
01:15:11.375 --> 01:15:14.125
-This is really wild.
-It is pretty wild. yes.

1095
01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:16.500
-Now I get it.
-What?

1096
01:15:16.583 --> 01:15:18.208
You were going to give up
being a Magi for me?

1097
01:15:18.291 --> 01:15:19.208
Yes.

1098
01:15:19.291 --> 01:15:21.208
We weren't talking about you.
we were talking about Santa.

1099
01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:22.791
Please. one at a time.

1100
01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:24.625
But how could you give it up?

1101
01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:28.583
You have the best job in the world.

1102
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:31.750
Boys and girls adore you.

1103
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:35.875
The Krampus has awoken.

1104
01:15:35.958 --> 01:15:38.791
He's possessed the Mayor
and kidnapped Santa Claus.

1105
01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:42.791
Melchior and Balthazar went to
rescue him. but they can't do it alone.

1106
01:15:47.208 --> 01:15:48.875
You know something?

1107
01:15:52.125 --> 01:15:54.500
You've always been
my favorite King.

1108
01:15:55.958 --> 01:15:57.833
And you always will be.

1109
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.416
Go on. move it.

1110
01:16:03.416 --> 01:16:05.458
-The Town Hall?
-It's around there.

1111
01:16:06.875 --> 01:16:09.708
Don't worry. Belén.
I'll go for the girls.

1112
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.083
-Magic exists!
-And it's so cool!

1113
01:16:30.916 --> 01:16:33.208
Look. the Christmas Star!

1114
01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:50.125
Good evening from Town Hall Square.

1115
01:16:50.208 --> 01:16:52.458
As you see. hundreds of people

1116
01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:54.708
have come to the door of the building

1117
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:59.458
to protest at the lack of news
about the Kings' parade.

1118
01:17:00.458 --> 01:17:02.541
Tonight. Christmas is at stake

1119
01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:05.125
and it's all in the hands
of three people:

1120
01:17:05.208 --> 01:17:06.541
the Three Kings.

1121
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.916
I'm honestly sorry that
you're going to miss the show.

1122
01:17:17.125 --> 01:17:21.333
But I want you to know
that I'm eternally grateful to you.

1123
01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:24.375
If not for your fight.

1124
01:17:24.708 --> 01:17:28.541
I could never have woken up.

1125
01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:36.916
Have a happy "Non-Christmas".

1126
01:17:40.791 --> 01:17:42.458
I really am sorry.

1127
01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:45.041
All this is my fault.

1128
01:17:45.541 --> 01:17:48.875
My need to humiliate them
was what awakened the Krampus.

1129
01:17:49.125 --> 01:17:50.708
You know what they say:

1130
01:17:50.791 --> 01:17:52.958
It takes two to make a fight.

1131
01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:57.833
Jealousy.

1132
01:17:58.541 --> 01:18:01.375
Yes. we admit it.
we were jealous of you.

1133
01:18:01.458 --> 01:18:05.875
We couldn't bear that every year
you surpassed us in everything.

1134
01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:09.583
What are you talking about?

1135
01:18:09.666 --> 01:18:12.125
I'm the one who envies you.

1136
01:18:12.625 --> 01:18:14.666
You are the originals.

1137
01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:17.541
the all-time three.
the Three Kings.

1138
01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:19.375
The Kings!

1139
01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:23.125
Always such friends. so united...

1140
01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:24.916
Well...

1141
01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.750
not so much now.

1142
01:18:26.833 --> 01:18:28.375
Caspar has abandoned us.

1143
01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:30.041
He's gone.

1144
01:18:30.125 --> 01:18:32.541
We may never see him again.

1145
01:18:34.916 --> 01:18:38.000
Such a sensitive and humble man.

1146
01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:40.958
A heart on legs.

1147
01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:43.625
He has only one flaw. that he's...

1148
01:18:43.708 --> 01:18:45.833
-very touchy.
-Very touchy.

1149
01:18:46.208 --> 01:18:47.291
What?

1150
01:18:47.541 --> 01:18:49.833
-Badmouthing me again?
-Caspar!

1151
01:18:50.916 --> 01:18:53.583
I'll see if I can find something
to get you out of here.

1152
01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:56.750
The mood here
at Town Hall Square

1153
01:18:56.833 --> 01:18:58.125
is getting tense.

1154
01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:00.750
The parade should've started
hours ago

1155
01:19:00.833 --> 01:19:04.458
and we still have no news
of the Three Kings.

1156
01:19:20.666 --> 01:19:22.000
I'm inside.

1157
01:20:00.291 --> 01:20:02.583
Our dear friend Caspar.

1158
01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:04.000
You're back.

1159
01:20:04.291 --> 01:20:06.291
Sure. Christmas has to be saved.

1160
01:20:06.375 --> 01:20:08.708
And I can only do it
with the help of...

1161
01:20:09.416 --> 01:20:10.708
my best friends.

1162
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.583
Do you think this will work?

1163
01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:16.625
We'll find out now.

1164
01:20:20.125 --> 01:20:21.333
Alright...

1165
01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.041
You can do it. Caspar.

1166
01:20:23.125 --> 01:20:24.708
Give it all you've got!

1167
01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:35.541
Smurf. clean all this up!
Not long to go.

1168
01:20:57.166 --> 01:21:00.666
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND ELF 1

1169
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.375
ALWAYS TOGETHER

1170
01:21:12.708 --> 01:21:13.833
Wait!

1171
01:21:13.916 --> 01:21:14.833
Wait.

1172
01:21:16.208 --> 01:21:18.458
This time. why don't you
start with Balthazar?

1173
01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:20.875
-What?
-Didn't you say you trusted me?

1174
01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:22.375
And I do trust you.

1175
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.208
-I trust you.
-Okay.

1176
01:21:25.166 --> 01:21:26.958
I really trust you! But...

1177
01:21:27.041 --> 01:21:29.791
he does too.
You trust him too?

1178
01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:32.458
-Of course.
-Start with Balthazar.

1179
01:21:34.125 --> 01:21:35.125
Okay.

1180
01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:57.541
Lil' guy!

1181
01:21:58.125 --> 01:21:59.125
You came back.

1182
01:22:00.375 --> 01:22:01.375
Yes.

1183
01:22:02.458 --> 01:22:03.750
You were right.

1184
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:06.500
It's not that you're not my friend.

1185
01:22:06.833 --> 01:22:08.166
you're just an idiot.

1186
01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:11.125
Yes. that's what I told you.
I'm an idiot.

1187
01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:18.583
We have to hurry.

1188
01:22:18.666 --> 01:22:21.791
We must stop the Krampus before
he goes out and cancels the parade.

1189
01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:25.166
If he does that.
he'll recover his original form

1190
01:22:25.791 --> 01:22:27.875
and we'll be powerless.

1191
01:22:29.583 --> 01:22:33.958
Who are you two and what
are you doing with Santa's sleigh?

1192
01:22:34.625 --> 01:22:36.125
They've taken Santa.

1193
01:22:36.208 --> 01:22:38.208
Santa has been kidnapped
by the Krampus.

1194
01:22:38.291 --> 01:22:41.208
Impossible. CUBMOB did away
with him centuries ago.

1195
01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:43.625
It's all a lie!

1196
01:22:44.208 --> 01:22:45.958
It's not a lie!

1197
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.000
However terrible it may be.
they're right.

1198
01:22:50.416 --> 01:22:51.875
The Krampus has awoken.

1199
01:22:54.375 --> 01:22:57.291
and we need the Christmas Star
to defeat him.

1200
01:22:58.375 --> 01:22:59.958
Are you one hundred percent sure?

1201
01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:00.958
Yes.

1202
01:23:01.666 --> 01:23:04.000
Have you seen it with your own eyes?

1203
01:23:04.083 --> 01:23:06.333
Well. no. but...

1204
01:23:06.416 --> 01:23:10.583
Then how can you assert this
with such boldness and finality?

1205
01:23:11.791 --> 01:23:13.125
The decision has been taken.

1206
01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:16.208
The Star stays in its place.

1207
01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:20.166
where it should be.
in the Magical World.

1208
01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:24.625
Who gave you the right to decide
the future of Christmas?

1209
01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:26.625
We are the Christmas beings.

1210
01:23:27.583 --> 01:23:29.416
Do you think that
Christmas belongs to you?

1211
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:34.833
Christmas doesn't belong to Santa.
to the Kings. or to any of you.

1212
01:23:35.375 --> 01:23:38.166
It belongs to all the boys
and girls in the world.

1213
01:23:38.666 --> 01:23:41.666
We are the protagonists.

1214
01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:49.625
Where are you going. Sandoval?

1215
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.916
How did you escape?

1216
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.125
Consider it a Christmas miracle.

1217
01:23:59.958 --> 01:24:01.541
Oh. really?

1218
01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:03.250
Betrayal?

1219
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.416
Well. well...

1220
01:24:07.583 --> 01:24:09.166
What do you intend to do exactly?

1221
01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:13.125
Talk to you before you make
the biggest mistake of your life.

1222
01:24:13.541 --> 01:24:15.166
That's your big plan?!

1223
01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.916
Shut up. Krampus!
Don't be so selfish.

1224
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.708
Not everything revolves
around you. you know?

1225
01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:23.875
We know you're in there. Ignacio.

1226
01:24:24.833 --> 01:24:26.958
And you don't want
to do away with Christmas.

1227
01:24:27.041 --> 01:24:29.291
That's the last thing
you'd want to do.

1228
01:24:29.375 --> 01:24:30.791
Of course not.

1229
01:24:30.875 --> 01:24:34.083
because you love Christmas
more than anyone.

1230
01:24:34.166 --> 01:24:36.041
Like when you were little.

1231
01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:41.041
Every year. the whole family
gathered at Christmas

1232
01:24:41.125 --> 01:24:43.125
in your grandparents' house.

1233
01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.500
Every year you and your brother
set up the Nativity scene.

1234
01:24:46.583 --> 01:24:49.500
Until your uncle Juan
lit the chimney

1235
01:24:49.875 --> 01:24:52.083
and you all sat and sang together:

1236
01:24:52.166 --> 01:24:54.208
Go. go. go. it's a shindig...

1237
01:24:54.291 --> 01:24:57.000
Go. go. go. it's Christmas Eve.

1238
01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:00.541
And surely you remember
that morning

1239
01:25:00.625 --> 01:25:02.958
when you went to open your present.

1240
01:25:03.041 --> 01:25:07.208
Without knowing how.
your first bicycle appeared.

1241
01:25:07.625 --> 01:25:09.750
The red BMX dirt bike.

1242
01:25:09.833 --> 01:25:11.416
With white wheels.

1243
01:25:21.375 --> 01:25:25.250
Do you really want
to end all this forever?

1244
01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:27.875
No.

1245
01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:30.666
I don't want to.

1246
01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.375
I don't want to.

1247
01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:40.500
I don't want to!

1248
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:44.416
I don't. no!

1249
01:25:48.708 --> 01:25:49.958
But I do!

1250
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:07.750
And now. if you'll excuse me.

1251
01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:09.958
I have to do away with Christmas.

1252
01:26:10.041 --> 01:26:12.708
His Excellency. Mayor Ignacio Sandoval.
has just come out.

1253
01:26:12.791 --> 01:26:16.583
It seems he's going to say something.
We hope it's good news.

1254
01:26:32.875 --> 01:26:34.583
It's official!

1255
01:26:34.666 --> 01:26:37.083
The Three Kings...

1256
01:26:37.583 --> 01:26:39.666
will not hold the parade!

1257
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:41.666
Scoundrel!

1258
01:26:44.041 --> 01:26:46.291
The Three Kings from the Orient

1259
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:50.250
have abandoned us as well.

1260
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:55.750
I'm too old for this.

1261
01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:05.166
We're lost without our magic.

1262
01:27:12.916 --> 01:27:13.958
It's Him.

1263
01:27:15.083 --> 01:27:17.208
-It's us!
-And we've brought help!

1264
01:27:17.291 --> 01:27:20.916
-But we need you to distract him.
-We need time.

1265
01:27:21.666 --> 01:27:23.791
Christmas is over!

1266
01:28:40.166 --> 01:28:43.666
Now I have all my power.

1267
01:29:02.833 --> 01:29:07.500
You can't do anything to me now.

1268
01:29:07.958 --> 01:29:11.291
Now no child will be safe

1269
01:29:11.375 --> 01:29:15.916
from the clutches of the Krampus.

1270
01:29:17.833 --> 01:29:19.458
You can't pass.

1271
01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:22.250
What'll you do to stop it?

1272
01:29:42.708 --> 01:29:46.041
When you open the blinds.

1273
01:29:46.458 --> 01:29:49.166
a porcelain color...

1274
01:29:52.041 --> 01:29:54.541
What's this about?

1275
01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.458
...marking the spot.

1276
01:29:59.541 --> 01:30:03.041
is a sign that Christmas is here...

1277
01:30:10.875 --> 01:30:14.291
If you look on a child

1278
01:30:14.625 --> 01:30:17.750
receiving affection...

1279
01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:22.208
Dude. dude. your turn.

1280
01:30:22.291 --> 01:30:23.916
If it snows again.

1281
01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.541
it's a sign that Christmas is here...

1282
01:30:27.625 --> 01:30:28.958
Enough!

1283
01:30:34.375 --> 01:30:36.875
Out. out!

1284
01:30:36.958 --> 01:30:40.083
Sorry. little girl. sorry.
Let's find them.

1285
01:30:42.166 --> 01:30:43.291
Enough.

1286
01:30:43.875 --> 01:30:46.666
Accept your defeat.

1287
01:30:47.416 --> 01:30:50.041
Christmas is dead.

1288
01:30:55.208 --> 01:30:58.750
If you hear carols from afar...

1289
01:30:58.833 --> 01:31:01.166
And people walking and laughing...

1290
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:03.625
Everything...

1291
01:31:04.875 --> 01:31:06.541
brings back memories

1292
01:31:06.625 --> 01:31:09.291
It's because Christmas has come.

1293
01:31:14.208 --> 01:31:17.875
I will have no mercy on you.

1294
01:31:17.958 --> 01:31:21.208
If when you close the windows.

1295
01:31:21.833 --> 01:31:25.375
the smell of hazelnuts

1296
01:31:26.083 --> 01:31:28.000
spread throughout your home

1297
01:31:28.083 --> 01:31:32.583
It's because Christmas has come.

1298
01:31:33.041 --> 01:31:36.500
Christmas has come.

1299
01:31:36.875 --> 01:31:40.250
Christmas...

1300
01:31:41.416 --> 01:31:46.625
has come!

1301
01:31:52.333 --> 01:31:54.916
Is this a joke or what?

1302
01:31:56.875 --> 01:31:59.375
No! It's a distraction!

1303
01:32:17.916 --> 01:32:20.208
Who are you?

1304
01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.375
Ana Ruiz.

1305
01:32:30.041 --> 01:32:31.916
trainee page.

1306
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.375
Sandoval.

1307
01:33:30.083 --> 01:33:30.958
Sandoval.

1308
01:33:32.416 --> 01:33:34.083
Sandoval.

1309
01:33:39.166 --> 01:33:43.291
Friends. we've finally
defeated the Krampus.

1310
01:33:44.708 --> 01:33:45.875
At last!

1311
01:33:47.291 --> 01:33:48.500
Great!

1312
01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:51.791
What are you doing here?

1313
01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:57.375
-I'm going to my office.
-Yes. good idea.

1314
01:33:58.541 --> 01:33:59.708
How pretty they are!

1315
01:34:01.541 --> 01:34:03.958
Mayor. welcome.

1316
01:34:04.708 --> 01:34:07.750
-Do you see something. do you see them?
-No.

1317
01:34:11.916 --> 01:34:15.208
Guys. this isn't over yet.

1318
01:34:15.291 --> 01:34:17.750
We have to recover Christmas.

1319
01:34:17.833 --> 01:34:19.916
They're waiting outside.

1320
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.583
Gosh. they're going to lynch us.

1321
01:34:22.916 --> 01:34:26.291
Maybe. but this is about
saving Christmas.

1322
01:34:26.625 --> 01:34:28.458
and someone reminded us

1323
01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:31.791
that the most important thing
about Christmas is not us.

1324
01:34:33.375 --> 01:34:35.958
Ana. dear.
why don't you go out first

1325
01:34:36.541 --> 01:34:38.750
and calm things down a little?
Go on.

1326
01:34:38.833 --> 01:34:40.791
-Me?
-Yes. yes. you!

1327
01:34:41.791 --> 01:34:44.333
Let's go. let's go.

1328
01:34:50.458 --> 01:34:51.375
Here she comes. here she comes.

1329
01:34:53.208 --> 01:34:54.166
It's Ana!

1330
01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:56.833
Get outta here! Get outta here!

1331
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.208
Hello?

1332
01:35:03.166 --> 01:35:04.875
Can you hear me?

1333
01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:08.250
I suppose you're wondering...

1334
01:35:08.333 --> 01:35:10.916
-Hit the road. you drag!
-That's right!

1335
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.083
Get outta here!

1336
01:35:13.375 --> 01:35:16.958
-As I was about to say...
-Nobody cares!

1337
01:35:17.041 --> 01:35:19.208
We want to see the Kings!

1338
01:35:19.291 --> 01:35:21.708
If you'll let me finish. maybe...

1339
01:35:21.791 --> 01:35:24.666
We want to see the Kings!
We want to see the Kings!

1340
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:27.208
We want to see the Kings!
We want to see the Kings!

1341
01:35:27.291 --> 01:35:29.208
Forget it...

1342
01:35:29.958 --> 01:35:31.625
With you tonight...

1343
01:35:31.708 --> 01:35:33.791
The Three Kings!

1344
01:35:55.958 --> 01:35:58.041
Merry Christmas!

1345
01:36:19.916 --> 01:36:22.250
Please give a big hand

1346
01:36:22.333 --> 01:36:25.458
for our great friend. Santa Claus!

1347
01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:30.375
I don't believe it.
it's your time! Enjoy!

1348
01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:35.500
Santa. Santa. Santa!

1349
01:36:35.583 --> 01:36:38.125
Santa. Santa. Santa!

1350
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:41.750
How are my people?

1351
01:36:42.833 --> 01:36:44.750
Merry Christmas!

1352
01:36:48.291 --> 01:36:51.208
Santa. Santa. Santa!

1353
01:37:22.208 --> 01:37:25.583
NO ENTRY

1354
01:37:45.416 --> 01:37:46.333
Well. my Kings.

1355
01:37:46.416 --> 01:37:50.458
Christmas together has been a pleasure.
but we have to split.

1356
01:37:50.541 --> 01:37:52.000
Where are you going?

1357
01:37:52.083 --> 01:37:55.208
What do you mean where?
To deliver my presents.

1358
01:37:55.458 --> 01:37:57.583
I can't let the boys
and girls of the world

1359
01:37:57.666 --> 01:37:59.583
go without Santa Claus'
Christmas Day presents.

1360
01:37:59.666 --> 01:38:01.208
Are we crazy or what?

1361
01:38:02.083 --> 01:38:04.166
Santa. you are aware
that today is the 5th?

1362
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:05.958
You relax.

1363
01:38:06.041 --> 01:38:09.708
I'm going to do a little trick
with the clock to turn back time.

1364
01:38:09.791 --> 01:38:12.416
Are you aware of how
dangerous that could be?

1365
01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.333
The consequences
could be catastrophic.

1366
01:38:14.416 --> 01:38:17.291
We'd face a terrible paradox
capable of causing

1367
01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:20.750
a chain reaction that would alter
the space-time continuum.

1368
01:38:20.833 --> 01:38:23.125
No. no. no. It's a joke!

1369
01:38:23.208 --> 01:38:24.541
I've never done it. ever.

1370
01:38:24.625 --> 01:38:26.875
This will be the first time
I've done it... again.

1371
01:38:26.958 --> 01:38:28.833
But understand me.

1372
01:38:29.583 --> 01:38:33.541
I can't let the kids get
the crappy presents you give them.

1373
01:38:33.625 --> 01:38:34.958
I'd never forgive myself.

1374
01:38:35.333 --> 01:38:37.791
Well. make the most of it. Kings.

1375
01:38:38.083 --> 01:38:41.583
Let's go. lil' guy. to work.
See you later. you old fogies.

1376
01:38:41.875 --> 01:38:43.291
Goodbye.

1377
01:38:44.708 --> 01:38:45.875
Well...

1378
01:38:46.708 --> 01:38:49.208
You have to love him
the way he is. right?

1379
01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:55.666
I don't know why.
but I think this means trouble.

1380
01:39:01.083 --> 01:39:04.291
Let's go!
To the past. Elf 1!
