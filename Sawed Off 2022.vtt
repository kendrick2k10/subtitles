All right. look. so GPS
says we got about six hours.

32
00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:19.332
I'll probably try doing
like 5 and 1/2. 5.

33
00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:21.416
Sounds like you're
excited to see Marj. huh?

34
00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:23.957
Now this is about you showing

I haven't seen or
talked to Marj in...

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:32.791
She's been a minute. man.

39

[scoffs]

41
00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:37.791

Yeah. man. you know.

43
00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:41.916
Boys. come on. no one in this
town is good enough for her.

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:44.874
but except for you.

45
00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:46.791
Yeah. and nobody's too
good for you either.

46
00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:48.874
And if you think that.

55
00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.625
Shit. I don't know. you tell me.

56
00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:10.957
I don't know.

57
00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.374
You know you need?

58
00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:15.582
Hey. look. act like
it's 20 years ago.

59
00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:17.749
That's right. and we

60
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.832
smoke out. shoot these
bucks. have a good time.

61
00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:23.041
Hey. you know they sell the
stuff in stores now. right?

62
00:05:23.042 --> 00:05:25.457
You don't have to get it in
a plastic baggie anymore.

63
00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.666
Hey. I grow my own shit.

64
00:05:26.667 --> 00:05:27.624
[chuckles]

65
00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:28.707
You know what I'm saying?

66
00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:31.416
It just feels right to be here.

67
00:05:31.417 --> 00:05:32.999
I missed this.

68
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.499
It's what I'm
talking about. dawg.

69
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.832
It's why you got to
come home more. man.

70
00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:37.166
This is where you're from.

71
00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:38.874
You've got to connect
with your roots. man.

72
00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:41.832
Plus. you can see what we're
doing around here nowadays.

73
00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:43.916
And what do we do
around here. huh?

74
00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:48.666
Uh. for me. survive.

75
00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:55.874
I hunt. I live. and I survive.

76
00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:58.041
Marj says no service when
we get to this one point.

77
00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:00.499
so she drew this map.

78
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.707
[chuckles]

79
00:06:01.708 --> 00:06:02.707
She drew this for
the rest of the way.

80
00:06:02.708 --> 00:06:04.041
What are you. kidding me?

81
00:06:04.042 --> 00:06:05.874
Hey. man. figure it out
because you navigator.

82
00:06:05.875 --> 00:06:07.999
Wait. this is our map?

83
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.041
Um. she gave us. so
go ahead navigator.

84
00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:11.082
[laughs]

85
00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:12.041
Or you just saying.

86
00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:14.457
[laughs]

87
00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:17.124
All right. I'll tell you what.
you probably could use a drink.

88
00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.707
Aha. yeah.

89
00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:20.041
No rules.

90
00:06:20.042 --> 00:06:21.082
All right.

91
00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:23.041
You drive. I'll navigate.

92
00:06:23.042 --> 00:06:25.166
[chuckles]

93
00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:28.707
OK. it is deserted out here.

94
00:06:28.708 --> 00:06:31.041
Like no sign of life anywhere.

95
00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:32.041
Hmm.

96
00:06:32.042 --> 00:06:33.874
Do you think we passed it?

97
00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:36.082
Oh. no. I mean. it's probably
somewhere right around up

98
00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:36.791
in here.

99
00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:38.249
Where?

100
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.749
I don't see it.

101
00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.457
Hey. watch out!

102
00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:41.082
Shit!

Scared the shit out of me. man.

107
00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:45.582
Where did he go?

108
00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:46.832
I don't know.

109
00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:47.457
The fuck he doing
in the first place?

110
00:06:47.458 --> 00:06:48.041
Fuck.

111
00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:48.916
Fuck was that?

112
00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:52.083
[suspenseful music]

113
00:06:53.583 --> 00:06:54.999
Where the hell did he go?

114
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.832
Drunk motherfucker.

115
00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:00.041
[animal growling]

116
00:07:00.042 --> 00:07:00.792
What's that shit?

117
00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:04.832
Let's get out of here.

118
00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:05.707
Yeah.

119
00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:07.207
[suspenseful music]

120
00:07:07.208 --> 00:07:08.082
Yeah.

[suspenseful music]

122
00:07:27.708 --> 00:07:32.582
Oh. look. she's already
outside waiting.

123
00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:33.916
Look at you.

124
00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:36.124

Wow.

129
00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:47.582
It's been forever.

130
00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:49.082
What? Like 3 years. at least?

131
00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:51.791
Yeah. I came back to town
a couple of years ago. but.

132
00:07:51.792 --> 00:07:53.707
Yeah. but he didn't stop
and said hi to nobody

133
00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:54.624
but. you know.

134
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:56.499
What are you doing now?

135
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.542
Stopping by or are you
actually here for a while?

136
00:08:00.792 --> 00:08:01.791
It's great to see you.

137
00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:05.166
Me too.

138
00:08:05.167 --> 00:08:06.791
I'm glad you guys
found the place.

139
00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:07.957
Barely.

140
00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:09.749
We found it.

141
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.999
I mean. I can't tell you. you
didn't give me any hug. loving

142
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.999
embrace and all that.

143
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.749
Oh my god. shut up.

144
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.749
Don't be a jerk.

145
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.332
I'm just telling the truth.

146
00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:15.791
Did you. Jomar?

147
00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:16.916
Come on. let me show
you guys the place.

148
00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:17.541
Now you want to
show me something.

149
00:08:17.542 --> 00:08:18.000
Come in.

150
00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:18.832
Show me.

151
00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:19.832
I'mma come on in.

152
00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:20.791
That's what we're going to do.

153
00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:23.167
[music playing]

154
00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:51.916
So that's the laundry.

155
00:08:51.917 --> 00:08:54.916
You guys can throw your
disgusting clothes tomorrow

156
00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:56.249
after the hunt.

157
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.874
You're not coming with us?

158
00:08:57.875 --> 00:08:59.249
Uh. no.

159
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.707
Well. you guys can do
your dumb man stuff.

160
00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.832
I have a million things
actually I need to do here.

161
00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:08.082
I have to go into town
and restock the woodpile.

162
00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:09.707
You chopping wood now.

163
00:09:09.708 --> 00:09:11.874
At least. you're not
doing any man work. huh.

164
00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:13.332
Oh. you got a
little six pointer.

165
00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:14.832
Oh. no. hey.

166
00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:16.874
Physical labor isn't
just something men do.

167
00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:18.166
Killing is.

168
00:09:18.167 --> 00:09:19.999
A bit of an exaggeration.

169
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.707
No. give me that axe. I'll
chop this whole forest down

170
00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:24.332
before you get some
started wood by night.

171
00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:25.249
[chuckles]

172
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.332
Give me a break. Frank.

173
00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:29.874
You used to weep playing t-ball.

174
00:09:29.875 --> 00:09:30.916
You remember that?

175
00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:31.333
Yeah.

176
00:09:31.334 --> 00:09:33.082
Yeah.

177
00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:34.416
Frank. you're never really
good at throwing wood around.

178
00:09:34.417 --> 00:09:35.916
Well. at least I know
how to throw that wood.

179
00:09:35.917 --> 00:09:36.916
Tell him. Marj.

180
00:09:36.917 --> 00:09:38.207
You know.

181
00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:39.749
I think you should leave
the wood chopping up

182
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.666
to Marj unless you
got a chainsaw.

183
00:09:41.667 --> 00:09:42.374
What?

184
00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:43.249
Oh. I got a chainsaw.

185
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.999
What?

186
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.999
Mm-hmm

187
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.749
Oh. that's all good things.

188
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.249
You're not running hunting buck
all day and then chop wood.

189
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.916
As a matter of fact. I bet
you'll eat my buck by noon.

190
00:09:50.917 --> 00:09:51.957
[chuckles]

191
00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:53.707
OK. yeah. I'll take those bags.

192
00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:55.041
Thank you.

193
00:09:55.042 --> 00:09:57.124
So you guys. there are
two bedrooms up there.

194
00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:59.707
The big one overlooking the
lake. obviously. is mine.

195
00:09:59.708 --> 00:10:02.082
but you can dig it out
for bugs in the other one.

196
00:10:02.083 --> 00:10:03.999
Mm-mm. negative. negative.
I don't share rooms

197
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.624
with grown ass men.

198
00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:09.832
However. I will
share one with you.

199
00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:12.374
Maybe you just
sleep in the shed.

200
00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.291
See that's that bullshit.

201
00:10:14.292 --> 00:10:17.041
Step.

202
00:10:17.042 --> 00:10:20.957
So how did you end up
with this place anyway?

203
00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.957
Well. I'm just still
getting settled.

204
00:10:22.958 --> 00:10:26.999
but it's been in my family since
my great. great grandfather.

205
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.416
or I'm told.

206
00:10:28.417 --> 00:10:30.416
It was getting passed down
on my dad's side though.

207
00:10:30.417 --> 00:10:32.999
so I never knew
the place existed

208
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.957
until I got a call from
the lawyer rambling to me.

209
00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:36.916
[exhale]

210
00:10:36.917 --> 00:10:37.957
I'm sorry about your dad.

211
00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.916
Yeah. I'm sorry about your dad.

212
00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:42.832
No. I'm not. never knew the guy.

213
00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:44.999
But he was good for
something at least. right?

214
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.457
Yeah. this place is dope.

215
00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:47.291
Yeah.

216
00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:48.832
You're a lucky lady.

217
00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:49.832
I could live forever
in a place like this.

218
00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:51.332
Man. you're right.

219
00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.124
I mean. you gave me a tree
stands with animals to hunt.

220
00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:54.916
peace here too.

221
00:10:54.917 --> 00:10:56.707
Yeah. nice living.

222
00:10:56.708 --> 00:10:58.041
Tranquility.

223
00:10:58.042 --> 00:10:59.124
Hey. Jon. come on. let's
check out these rooms.

224
00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:01.166
Get started with our day. man.

225
00:11:01.167 --> 00:11:03.166
Oh. go put your stuff up.

226
00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:07.707
OK

227
00:11:07.708 --> 00:11:10.667
[groans]

228
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.874
Woo. yeah. small and dry.

229
00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:17.417
Well. this is it. huh?

230
00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:22.916
Yeah.

231
00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:24.416
I guess it's going
to be like camp.

232
00:11:24.417 --> 00:11:26.207
Yeah. creepy ass camp.

233
00:11:26.208 --> 00:11:28.166
I got top bunk.

234
00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:31.291
I mean. you're the
one who get shanked.

235
00:11:31.292 --> 00:11:34.291
Hey. look at this shit. man.

236
00:11:34.292 --> 00:11:35.749
What is it?

237
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.291
I don't know some
little creepy. demonic

238
00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:42.374
looking dreamcatcher type shit.

239
00:11:42.375 --> 00:11:43.999
Yeah?

240
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.832
You think old man Marjorie
was into Hocus Pocus?

241
00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:49.374
I don't know. I don't like it.

242
00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:50.957
I don't like it at all.

243
00:11:50.958 --> 00:11:52.832
I've seen stuff
like this before.

244
00:11:52.833 --> 00:11:53.791
Yeah?

245
00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:55.291
Where?

246
00:11:55.292 --> 00:11:58.124
I took a class in the mines.

247
00:11:58.125 --> 00:11:59.874
I mean. it's not what
this is. but yeah.

248
00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:03.082
kind of looks like symbols
for protection or something.

249
00:12:03.083 --> 00:12:04.791
Protection from what?

250
00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:06.332
I don't know.

251
00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:08.416
Yeah. well. the protection
I'mma need is probably from you

252
00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:10.416
into the way you've
been. man. right?

253
00:12:10.417 --> 00:12:11.332
Yeah.

254
00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:12.957
Similar places. Frank.

255
00:12:12.958 --> 00:12:13.541
Similar places.

256
00:12:13.542 --> 00:12:15.582
Yeah.

257
00:12:15.583 --> 00:12:16.916
Oh.

258
00:12:16.917 --> 00:12:18.832
I forgot that.

259
00:12:18.833 --> 00:12:21.125
[deep exhale]

260
00:12:24.208 --> 00:12:24.792
Jon.

261
00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:29.957
Hey. yo. Jon?

262
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.082
[suspenseful music]

263
00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:34.124
You good?

264
00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:35.041
Jon?

265
00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:35.791
[inaudible] yeah. it's...

266
00:12:35.792 --> 00:12:36.292
You all right?

267
00:12:36.293 --> 00:12:37.207
Yeah.

268
00:12:37.208 --> 00:12:38.041
No. yeah. man. I'm good.

269
00:12:38.042 --> 00:12:38.542
All right.

270
00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:39.042
I'm good.

271
00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:46.916
[deep exhale]

272
00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:49.416
So why are you here. man?

273
00:12:49.417 --> 00:12:50.416
Hmm?

274
00:12:50.417 --> 00:12:53.374
Because Marj invited me.

275
00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:55.124
I know Marj invited you.

276
00:12:55.125 --> 00:12:56.999
I'm saying why you ain't come
back any time before now?

277
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.291
No. serious. I know Marj would
love to hang out with you.

278
00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:01.250
You know. didn't even
call me. so what's up?

279
00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:06.957
Look. man. I'm sorry.

280
00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:13.041
I... I got out. I just had
to stay away. you know.

281
00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.457
Come on. Jon. it's a
bullshit answer. man.

282
00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:16.291
That's weak.

283
00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:17.291
That's weak. dawg.

284
00:13:17.292 --> 00:13:18.291
What do you want me to say?

285
00:13:18.292 --> 00:13:18.957
I want you to talk to me. man.

286
00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.374
Be real.

287
00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:21.499
You still have feelings for
Marj. then say so. dawg.

288
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.000
I mean. come on. it's me.

289
00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:28.124
It isn't like that.

290
00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:28.832
Yeah?

291
00:13:28.833 --> 00:13:30.332
Yeah.

292
00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:32.541
[deep exhale]

293
00:13:32.542 --> 00:13:35.499
Hey. well. look
man. when you left.

294
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.957
Marj was going through it. man.

295
00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:38.541
And it's for years.
and I was just here

296
00:13:38.542 --> 00:13:40.291
to pick up the pieces.

297
00:13:40.292 --> 00:13:42.582
It just happened.

298
00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:44.082
Yeah. I know.

299
00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:45.624
I just want to make sure
we good though. man.

300
00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:46.374
I get it.

301
00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:47.166
We're good.

302
00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:48.166
Man?

303
00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:49.332
So who needs a banquet beer?

304
00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:51.499
Hey. as will appear.
I'll take one.

305
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.332
I'll take 3.

306
00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.332
What did I walk in on?

307
00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:58.249
Well. old Jon boy
here say he going

308
00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.541
to shoot a big buck
tomorrow. so we're

309
00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:02.041
going to see what's
up with that.

310
00:14:02.042 --> 00:14:03.541
Yeah. the big old bucks.

311
00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:05.999
Sure. you don't want
to come with us. Marj?

312
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.541
Hmm. you two in the
woods with guns?

313
00:14:08.542 --> 00:14:11.041
Yeah. no. I'll pass.

314
00:14:11.042 --> 00:14:12.999
You coming?

315
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.124
Yeah.

316
00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:15.582
Frank?

317
00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:16.957
Yeah. I'll be up in a minute.

318
00:14:16.958 --> 00:14:17.541
OK.

319
00:14:17.542 --> 00:14:18.541
Yeah. OK.

320
00:14:18.542 --> 00:14:20.124
Hey. did you shake this up?

321
00:14:20.125 --> 00:14:21.499
You know how you get down. Marj.

322
00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.041
Uh. try and sip.

323
00:14:23.042 --> 00:14:25.167
See. just what I do.

324
00:14:28.083 --> 00:14:29.916
We going to have some fun now.

325
00:14:29.917 --> 00:14:31.333
We going to have some fun.

326
00:14:34.917 --> 00:14:38.582
Yeah. catching one more.

327
00:14:38.583 --> 00:14:41.542
[music playing]

328
00:14:43.125 --> 00:14:45.541
You know. they do
make lighters. Frank.

329
00:14:45.542 --> 00:14:47.166
This is more fun though.

330
00:14:47.167 --> 00:14:48.124
Yeah?

331
00:14:48.125 --> 00:14:50.582
It's my fire. my creation.

332
00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:53.416
So. Jon. what's. uh. what's
been going on with you?

333
00:14:53.417 --> 00:14:54.916
Yeah. what's up?

334
00:14:54.917 --> 00:14:57.916
Realizing life
isn't all you wanted

335
00:14:57.917 --> 00:14:59.542
it coming back to your roots?

336
00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.541
Maybe I wanted to
do more of this.

337
00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:05.707
Do more of what?

338
00:15:05.708 --> 00:15:07.166
Live in a cabin?

339
00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:09.207
Die in these creepy ass woods?

340
00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:11.249
Yeah. well. speaking
of creepiness.

341
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.624
what's up with the weird
symbols upstairs in the room?

342
00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:17.957
Uh. well. I don't know what
they were using this place for.

343
00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:20.082
I mean. I didn't know
my dad or his family.

344
00:15:20.083 --> 00:15:22.541
They could have been just using
the place for human sacrifice

345
00:15:22.542 --> 00:15:23.249
for all I know.

346
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.999
What?

347
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.707
They look like. I don't know
like pagan symbols or something

348
00:15:27.708 --> 00:15:29.332
like used for protection.

349
00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:32.124
Yeah. well. Jon is an
expert on the dominion. so.

350
00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:34.582
Protection from what?

351
00:15:34.583 --> 00:15:36.082
I don't know.

352
00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:38.291
I don't know. witches.

353
00:15:38.292 --> 00:15:41.416
You're worried
about witches. Jon?

354
00:15:41.417 --> 00:15:42.999
I'm just saying.

355
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.041
I did a little research
on my history of the land

356
00:15:45.042 --> 00:15:46.041
when I got the deed.

357
00:15:46.042 --> 00:15:47.749
There's a bit of a history.

358
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.582
You guys are up
for a scary story?

359
00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.124
No. I don't fuck
with scary stories

360
00:15:53.125 --> 00:15:54.041
not when I'm in the wood.

361
00:15:54.042 --> 00:15:54.458
Fine. I won't tell you.

362
00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:55.291
Come on.

363
00:15:55.292 --> 00:15:55.750
Come on. tell us.

364
00:15:55.751 --> 00:15:56.457
Tell us.

365
00:15:56.458 --> 00:15:57.457
What is it?

366
00:15:57.458 --> 00:15:58.457
No. I don't want to scare...

367
00:15:58.458 --> 00:15:59.999
You know. Frank's delicate.

368
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.332
Symbols on the walls.
ancient legends stories.

369
00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:03.082
that's just a recipe
with some bullshit.

370
00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.082
Look where we at. man.

371
00:16:04.083 --> 00:16:05.291
Don't fuck around with that.

372
00:16:05.292 --> 00:16:06.457
Come on. come on.
what's the story?

373
00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:07.666
Tell us the story.

374
00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:12.124
OK. so a legend that
I heard dates back

375
00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:16.666
to the 1800s. which is
when the cabin was built.

376
00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:19.207
There was some families
traveling West looking

377
00:16:19.208 --> 00:16:21.541
for a land to homestead.

378
00:16:21.542 --> 00:16:24.666
They came by these woods.

379
00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:28.332
And the got here. everything
was flourishing with life.

380
00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:32.041
There were huge trees. all
the wildlife you could hunt.

381
00:16:32.042 --> 00:16:35.832
But eventually. the
respect and appreciation

382
00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:39.166
that they had for the
land started to fade.

383
00:16:39.167 --> 00:16:41.666
and they just went over
indulged and expected the area

384
00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.291
to continue to provide.

385
00:16:44.292 --> 00:16:48.374
People were fat and happy.

386
00:16:48.375 --> 00:16:51.666
The woods were pissed.

387
00:16:51.667 --> 00:16:52.749
The woods?

388
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.624
That's wood. pissed.

389
00:16:55.625 --> 00:16:59.166
So one day as if a switch
had just been flipped.

390
00:16:59.167 --> 00:17:00.374
they woke up. right?

391
00:17:00.375 --> 00:17:03.249
And all their food
had just dried out.

392
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.124
And when they went to hunt
for more. every animal

393
00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:10.791
they caught was hollow.
empty. dry. no meat.

394
00:17:10.792 --> 00:17:12.666
They basically
started to starve.

395
00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:15.207
The entire community fell apart.

396
00:17:15.208 --> 00:17:17.791
And then one night...

397
00:17:17.792 --> 00:17:19.166
You hear that shit?

398
00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:21.166
I hear it.

399
00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:24.291
It was just like that at night.

400
00:17:24.292 --> 00:17:26.749
Creepy strange
presence came to visit

401
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.707
each one of those settlers.

402
00:17:28.708 --> 00:17:29.832
Gave them a choice.

403
00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:31.249
They could either
stay on the land

404
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.707
and have all this
abundant food again

405
00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:39.249
and continue this life in the
woods or die of starvation.

406
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.166
Catch was that those
who decided to stay

407
00:17:42.167 --> 00:17:45.541
were given plenty of food.

408
00:17:45.542 --> 00:17:46.374
OK.

409
00:17:46.375 --> 00:17:47.791
Human flesh.

410
00:17:47.792 --> 00:17:48.832
Come on. come on.

411
00:17:48.833 --> 00:17:51.207
And less of life.

412
00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:55.499
And so they all just kind of
went mad. killing. eating. then

413
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.499
killing then eating.

414
00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:02.291
Now they're doomed for eternity
to wander these woods living

415
00:18:02.292 --> 00:18:04.125
off the bodies of others.

416
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:12.582
I'll tell you what. I'mma
let y'all two have it.

417
00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:15.166
I'll go get another beer.

418
00:18:15.167 --> 00:18:17.582
Yeah. fuck that story.

419
00:18:17.583 --> 00:18:20.249
[chuckles]

420
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.749
How's a man whose not
afraid of anything

421
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.207
gets scared of scary stories?

422
00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:24.625
Yeah.

423
00:18:24.626 --> 00:18:26.707
Yeah.

424
00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:27.750
I'm really glad you came.

425
00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:38.332
I'll be honest. I was a little
surprised by the invite.

426
00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:40.457
Yeah.

427
00:18:40.458 --> 00:18:43.207
Yeah. I kind of stopped
thinking about you. I guess.

428
00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:49.707
and you kind of just popped
back into my head one night.

429
00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:50.541
Oh yeah?

430
00:18:50.542 --> 00:18:52.957
[chuckles]

431
00:18:52.958 --> 00:18:54.499
You've been dreaming
about me. Marj?

432
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.332
[chuckles]

433
00:18:55.333 --> 00:18:56.624
Not so many thing.

434
00:18:56.625 --> 00:18:59.749
Weird. I'm not trying
to creep you out.

435
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.542
It just felt good
to see you again.

436
00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:08.791
Listen. I'm not going to get in
the middle of anything that's

437
00:19:08.792 --> 00:19:10.457
going on with you and Frank.

438
00:19:10.458 --> 00:19:12.457
There's nothing
going with Frank.

439
00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:14.457
Not anymore.

440
00:19:14.458 --> 00:19:16.541
I've known him since we
were kids. I love him.

441
00:19:16.542 --> 00:19:18.666
He's comfortable.

442
00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:21.332
Comfortable is good.

443
00:19:21.333 --> 00:19:24.707
I don't like comfortable.

444
00:19:24.708 --> 00:19:30.333
I just can't shake the feeling
that I. uh. might want you.

445
00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:35.666
Oh. what's that look for?

446
00:19:35.667 --> 00:19:37.332
Did I walk in on something?

447
00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:37.833
Hey.

448
00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:40.708
[chuckles]

449
00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:48.416
All right. 5:00 AM is
going to come early for me.

450
00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:50.957
This has been fun.

451
00:19:50.958 --> 00:19:52.332
I'll see you in the morning.

452
00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:52.999
All right. big dawg.

453
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.874

[deep exhale]

457
00:20:24.542 --> 00:20:28.041
Dude. you look like shit.

458
00:20:28.042 --> 00:20:35.374
I got it. dawg

459
00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:39.416
Remember. boys. don't
worry. I own these woods.

460
00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:42.333
[music playing]

461
00:21:06.708 --> 00:21:09.416
Yeah. it's all right. man.

462
00:21:09.417 --> 00:21:10.082
Oh yeah.

463
00:21:10.083 --> 00:21:10.750
It's all right.

464
00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:16.541
All right. I'm
counting on you. man.

465
00:21:16.542 --> 00:21:20.041
I haven't been out in these
kind of woods in 20 years.

466
00:21:20.042 --> 00:21:23.791
Come on. grasshopper.

467
00:21:23.792 --> 00:21:27.332
Come on.

468
00:21:27.333 --> 00:21:30.292
[heavy breathing]

469
00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:33.457
It's going to be all right.

470
00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:34.124
What's that?

471
00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:34.874
Feels good.

472
00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:36.874
It's a nice day.

473
00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:38.374
It's freezing out here.

474
00:21:38.375 --> 00:21:39.791
It's freezing out here. Frank.

475
00:21:39.792 --> 00:21:40.957
You a asshole.

476
00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:41.791
[laughs]

477
00:21:41.792 --> 00:21:42.916
So.

478
00:21:42.917 --> 00:21:45.457
Do you even know
where we're going?

479
00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:47.124
Of course. not.

480
00:21:47.125 --> 00:21:52.416
I figured we'd find a nice
clearing. set up shop.

481
00:21:52.417 --> 00:21:54.749
see what comes by.

482
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.457
And what's going to come by?

483
00:21:56.458 --> 00:22:00.374
Mainly small animals.
birds. rabbits.

484
00:22:00.375 --> 00:22:03.124
ducks. but what we
want is that big buck.

485
00:22:03.125 --> 00:22:07.874
Yeah. I'll be fine with some
quiet in a nice day bus.

486
00:22:07.875 --> 00:22:08.832
Already?

487
00:22:08.833 --> 00:22:09.957
Sure.

488
00:22:09.958 --> 00:22:13.416
My god. we just got here. man.

489
00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:15.041
Day has just begun.

490
00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:17.582
Oh.

491
00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:20.457
Shit. here.

492
00:22:20.458 --> 00:22:21.957
You taking nowhere. man.

493
00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:25.457
Come on. Frank. find us a spot.

494
00:22:25.458 --> 00:22:27.499
A spot where I could
sit real comfortably.

495
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.541
and not do too much.

496
00:22:29.542 --> 00:22:30.499
Got one.

497
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.000
Come over here.

498
00:22:31.001 --> 00:22:31.916
Fuck!

499
00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:34.832
Dude. what the fuck it?

500
00:22:34.833 --> 00:22:37.166
Fuck. Frank?

501
00:22:37.167 --> 00:22:38.457
Frank?

505
00:22:41.667 --> 00:22:43.499
Get it off. Frank.

506
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.041
Frank?

507
00:22:44.042 --> 00:22:44.916
Frank?

Come on. set up.

Yeah.

518

Let's see what we have here.

519
00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:27.832
We get down right here. you have
this whole thing as a window.

520
00:23:27.833 --> 00:23:29.207
right?

521
00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:30.749
What do we need protection for?

522
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.249
The deer going to be
shooting at us or what?

Jesus Christ!

What?

529
00:24:04.792 --> 00:24:05.957
I just... it's just...

530
00:24:05.958 --> 00:24:07.957
You thought we
were here to hunt?

531
00:24:07.958 --> 00:24:08.916
Huh. Jon?

532
00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:09.624
It's fine.

533
00:24:09.625 --> 00:24:10.624
It's fine.

534
00:24:10.625 --> 00:24:11.874
What did you hit?

535
00:24:11.875 --> 00:24:13.207
Nothing.

536
00:24:13.208 --> 00:24:14.957
The damn cat got away.

537
00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:16.082
A cat?

538
00:24:16.083 --> 00:24:17.541
Are you fucking
kidding me. Frank?

539
00:24:17.542 --> 00:24:18.624
Whoa. whoa. whoa. you
need to come down.

540
00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:19.666
Look. it's a rabbit. man.

541
00:24:19.667 --> 00:24:20.875
It's a fucking rabbit.

542
00:24:23.625 --> 00:24:25.166
Don't know why that
makes it any better.

543

Look. stop pussy firing
this place. Jon. all right?

544
00:24:28.625 --> 00:24:30.291
Now look. I'm out here
in the middle of this

545
00:24:30.292 --> 00:24:32.666
get Al Woods with your
ass. we're miles away

546
00:24:32.667 --> 00:24:33.874
from civilization. all right?

547
00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:36.124

Just like your high
school tryouts. right?

552
00:24:40.667 --> 00:24:42.249
You weren't filling
it. but you manned up

553

554
00:24:43.708 --> 00:24:44.916

What is going on?

738
00:33:59.708 --> 00:34:00.707
This isn't funny.

739
00:34:00.708 --> 00:34:02.374
You shouldn't have came back.

740
00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:05.541
Is that what this is about?

741
00:34:05.542 --> 00:34:07.124
Get out of here with that shit.

742
00:34:07.125 --> 00:34:08.791
What are you two
actually arguing about?

743
00:34:08.792 --> 00:34:09.457
Show her.

744
00:34:09.458 --> 00:34:10.499
What?

745
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.666
Show her your fucking chest.

746
00:34:11.667 --> 00:34:12.666
Man. fuck you. I'm
not doing that.

747
00:34:12.667 --> 00:34:13.707
I killed him. Marj.

748
00:34:13.708 --> 00:34:14.832
I killed him.

749
00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:15.874
Out there in the
woods. I shot him.

750
00:34:15.875 --> 00:34:17.374
I shot him right in the chest.

751
00:34:17.375 --> 00:34:18.416
I saw him. he was dead
right in front of me.

752
00:34:18.417 --> 00:34:19.832
He's a murderer.

753
00:34:19.833 --> 00:34:21.582
And now he's standing
here right in front of us.

754
00:34:21.583 --> 00:34:22.541
I don't know.

755
00:34:22.542 --> 00:34:24.457
Frank. what happened?

756
00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:25.707
It was pretty much what he said.

757
00:34:25.708 --> 00:34:26.624
No. he's telling the truth.

758
00:34:26.625 --> 00:34:27.541
Oh my god. OK. fuck you.

759
00:34:27.542 --> 00:34:28.249

I don't know.

764
00:34:31.875 --> 00:34:33.207
Maybe I'll go stay in
town for the night.

765
00:34:33.208 --> 00:34:34.207
You guys obviously
have some shit

766
00:34:34.208 --> 00:34:35.166
you need to work out alone.

767
00:34:35.167 --> 00:34:36.582
We are telling the truth.

768
00:34:36.583 --> 00:34:38.582
No. this was obviously a
giant mistake on my part.

769
00:34:38.583 --> 00:34:39.916
I should not have
brought you guys here.

770
00:34:39.917 --> 00:34:41.416
If you want to lose
your fucking minds.

771
00:34:41.417 --> 00:34:42.541

How did you get back here?

778
00:35:19.292 --> 00:35:22.750

783
00:35:43.792 --> 00:35:44.750
You pulled the trigger.

784
00:35:47.708 --> 00:35:48.792
And after that?

785
00:35:55.333 --> 00:35:59.457

How is that possible?

789
00:36:08.958 --> 00:36:10.707
You should have showed her.

790
00:36:10.708 --> 00:36:12.332
And say what. Jon?

791
00:36:12.333 --> 00:36:16.291
Hey. Marj. Jon shot
me through the heart.

happened. not this way.

Yeah.

923
00:47:03.417 --> 00:47:05.999
Well. I'm sorry about all
the shit I did to you too.

924
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.332
Yeah.

925
00:47:07.333 --> 00:47:09.082
I guess I can't beat you
one-on-one no more. huh?

926
00:47:09.083 --> 00:47:12.207
You could barely beat me before.

927
00:47:12.208 --> 00:47:13.374
One point?

928
00:47:13.375 --> 00:47:14.166
Barely beat you?

929
00:47:14.167 --> 00:47:16.249
Oh one point.

930
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.291
Take me lose my arm for
you to win. man. I guess.

931
00:47:18.292 --> 00:47:20.166
[chuckles]

932
00:47:20.167 --> 00:47:21.874
How are we going to
explain this to Marj?

933
00:47:21.875 --> 00:47:25.041
No. how are you going to
explain this to. Marj?

934
00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:26.957
You started this shit.

935
00:47:26.958 --> 00:47:30.082
You saw how she took
it the first time.

936
00:47:30.083 --> 00:47:31.916
It's on you. bro.

937
00:47:31.917 --> 00:47:33.042
We should move this body.

938
00:47:35.542 --> 00:47:37.166
Yeah.

939
00:47:37.167 --> 00:47:38.957
Oh. you got the one... the
one in the house of you.

940
00:47:38.958 --> 00:47:40.166
so you want to get that.

941
00:47:40.167 --> 00:47:42.249
Don't want her stumbling
over that shit.

942
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:45.082
How are you going
to explain that?

943
00:47:45.083 --> 00:47:47.416
[sighs]

944
00:47:47.417 --> 00:47:49.957
[suspenseful music]

945
00:47:49.958 --> 00:47:52.875
[sniffles]

946
00:47:57.083 --> 00:47:59.707
Well. fuck me. you going
to give me a hand. huh?

947
00:47:59.708 --> 00:48:01.541
No. I'm going to
take your whole body.

948
00:48:01.542 --> 00:48:04.332
Hey. the fuck is
wrong with you. man?

949
00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:06.707
You get your own motherfucking
body. I got mine.

950
00:48:06.708 --> 00:48:09.457
Yeah. seems fair.

951
00:48:09.458 --> 00:48:13.291
This ain't no
motherfucking game. man.

952
00:48:13.292 --> 00:48:16.082
What about those
bodies in the woods?

953
00:48:16.083 --> 00:48:16.999
[deep exhale]

954
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.207
Man. shit. fuck them.

955
00:48:19.208 --> 00:48:21.207
Let the animals eat them.

956
00:48:21.208 --> 00:48:24.167
[suspenseful music]

957
00:48:27.542 --> 00:48:31.041
[deep exhale]

958
00:48:31.042 --> 00:48:32.625
Why the hell would
you come up here?

959
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:38.207
[exhale]

960
00:48:38.208 --> 00:48:39.207

[heavy breathing]

965
00:49:14.625 --> 00:49:18.374
Hey. you go talk to her. man.

966
00:49:18.375 --> 00:49:21.624
I don't want her
seeing me like this.

967
00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.041
Jon?

968
00:49:23.042 --> 00:49:24.332
Frank?

969
00:49:24.333 --> 00:49:25.207
Go. man.

970
00:49:25.208 --> 00:49:27.958
[suspenseful music]

971
00:49:30.375 --> 00:49:33.333
[deep exhale]

972
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:04.082
Jon. Jon.

973
00:50:04.083 --> 00:50:05.374
Jon.

974
00:50:05.375 --> 00:50:07.124
Jon. OK. you're not
going to believe this.

975
00:50:07.125 --> 00:50:09.332
I tried to go into
town. but... but...

976
00:50:09.333 --> 00:50:11.166
You're... you're not
going to believe me I...

977
00:50:11.167 --> 00:50:14.166
Marj. come on. just tell me.

978
00:50:14.167 --> 00:50:16.583
[suspenseful music]

979
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.082
[sighs]

980
00:50:25.083 --> 00:50:27.041
Oh. my...

981
00:50:27.042 --> 00:50:30.000
[suspenseful music]

982
00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:50.082
Oh my god. what the fuck house?

983
00:50:50.083 --> 00:50:51.791
OK.

984
00:50:51.792 --> 00:50:54.708
[exhales]

985
00:50:57.333 --> 00:50:58.791
Oh my god. what the fuck?

986
00:50:58.792 --> 00:51:00.417
How c... I'm suppose...

987
00:51:03.583 --> 00:51:06.541
I just kept driving and driving
and ending up just right

988
00:51:06.542 --> 00:51:08.707
here by this same spot.

989
00:51:08.708 --> 00:51:09.541
[sniffles]

990
00:51:09.542 --> 00:51:10.207
I couldn't leave.

991
00:51:10.208 --> 00:51:12.208
[sobs]

992
00:51:13.625 --> 00:51:14.707
Oh my god.

993
00:51:14.708 --> 00:51:17.707
Oh my god. what happened to you?

994
00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:19.582
Where's Frank?

995
00:51:19.583 --> 00:51:21.207
Hey.

996
00:51:21.208 --> 00:51:22.249
Oh.

997
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.749
OK. OK. OK. what is going on?

998
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:25.416
Come here.

999
00:51:25.417 --> 00:51:28.707
Marjorie. what we told
you today was the truth.

1000
00:51:28.708 --> 00:51:31.291
Frank and I have spent the
day killing each other over

1001
00:51:31.292 --> 00:51:35.582
and over again. and we keep
coming back alive over and over

1002
00:51:35.583 --> 00:51:36.457
again.

1003
00:51:36.458 --> 00:51:37.541
So what are you saying?

1004
00:51:37.542 --> 00:51:39.124
You guys are fucking zombies?

1005
00:51:39.125 --> 00:51:41.582
Well. I mean not exactly.

1006
00:51:41.583 --> 00:51:42.291
[groans]

1007
00:51:42.292 --> 00:51:43.874
[screams]

1008
00:51:43.875 --> 00:51:45.249
Oh my god. you killed him.

1009
00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:46.666
God. you killed

1010
00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:47.749
No. I know this is freaking
you out but it's OK.

1011
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:48.666
Fucking killed him.

1012
00:51:48.667 --> 00:51:49.582
We've done it all day.

1013
00:51:49.583 --> 00:51:50.541
He told you.

1014
00:51:50.542 --> 00:51:51.207
Get the fuck away from me.

1015
00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:52.332
No.

1016
00:51:52.333 --> 00:51:53.582
All day this was
going on all day.

1017
00:51:53.583 --> 00:51:54.832
Will... will you stop.

1018
00:51:54.833 --> 00:51:55.499
What are you going
to do with a rock?

1019
00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:55.917
No. no.

1020
00:51:55.918 --> 00:51:57.416
No.

1021
00:51:57.417 --> 00:51:58.416
Will you stay... now
that was unnecessary.

1022
00:51:58.417 --> 00:51:59.957
Hey. my arm's missing.

1023
00:51:59.958 --> 00:52:01.332
Hey. hey.

1024
00:52:01.333 --> 00:52:02.249
[screams]

1025
00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:03.291
It's OK.

1026
00:52:03.292 --> 00:52:04.582
It's OK.

1027
00:52:04.583 --> 00:52:05.666
See. it's OK.

1028
00:52:05.667 --> 00:52:07.749
See. you never listen.

1029
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:09.666
I told you he was coming back.

1030
00:52:09.667 --> 00:52:11.249
[heavy breathing]

1031
00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.625
[animal howling]

1032
00:52:14.625 --> 00:52:15.208
It's OK.

1033
00:52:28.833 --> 00:52:31.833
[animal howling]

1034
00:52:44.375 --> 00:52:46.332
This doesn't make any sense.

1035
00:52:46.333 --> 00:52:49.416
None of it does.

1036
00:52:49.417 --> 00:52:51.749
Yeah.

1037
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:53.832
Like have you noticed
anything weird. strange.

1038
00:52:53.833 --> 00:52:56.457
supernatural stuff bullshit
since you've been up here?

1039
00:52:56.458 --> 00:52:58.666
Well. besides the endless
road that won't let us leave?

1040
00:52:58.667 --> 00:53:00.666
Just calm down. all right?

1041
00:53:00.667 --> 00:53:04.457
No I'm talking about
before we got here.

1042
00:53:04.458 --> 00:53:05.499
any time you came before?

1043
00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.999
No.

1044
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.374
I just. I got here for the
first time a few days ago.

1045
00:53:08.375 --> 00:53:09.791
It was the first
time I'd come here.

1046
00:53:09.792 --> 00:53:11.332
OK. OK. OK.

1047
00:53:11.333 --> 00:53:12.541
What about the symbols
on the walls upstairs.

1048
00:53:12.542 --> 00:53:14.207
you know anything about that?

1049
00:53:14.208 --> 00:53:15.916
No. I'm just as confused
as you guys are. OK?

1050
00:53:15.917 --> 00:53:18.582
Like literally all those I was
just going to throw them away.

1051
00:53:18.583 --> 00:53:19.707
No. that's bullshit there.

1052
00:53:19.708 --> 00:53:21.374
[scoffs]

1053
00:53:21.375 --> 00:53:22.999
All the stories you were
telling and all that nonsense.

1054
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.666
because it seems
like me and this man

1055
00:53:24.667 --> 00:53:26.374
are the one that's paying
for whatever the price is

1056
00:53:26.375 --> 00:53:27.499
what's going on around here.

1057
00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:28.457
Will you cut it out. Frank?

1058
00:53:28.458 --> 00:53:29.582
This isn't her fault.

1059
00:53:29.583 --> 00:53:31.582
Oh my god. you're
so fucking real.

1060
00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:34.874
Yo. I'm not convinced. man.

1061
00:53:34.875 --> 00:53:37.916
I've been here before. man.

1062
00:53:37.917 --> 00:53:39.707
What are you talking about?

1063
00:53:39.708 --> 00:53:41.707
No. not physically. but like
you know how my dreams are real

1064
00:53:41.708 --> 00:53:44.624
and she was there.

1065
00:53:44.625 --> 00:53:46.832
What?

1066
00:53:46.833 --> 00:53:48.249
Yeah.

1067
00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:50.416
We were in the woods.

1068
00:53:50.417 --> 00:53:56.249
These woods with you.

1069
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:58.582
What?

1070
00:53:58.583 --> 00:54:03.082
You're not the only one
that's been having nightmares.

1071
00:54:03.083 --> 00:54:04.541
Give us a minute. Marj.

1072
00:54:04.542 --> 00:54:04.917
Frank?

1073
00:54:04.918 --> 00:54:05.542
Yeah.

1074
00:54:09.583 --> 00:54:10.791
You know something.

1075
00:54:10.792 --> 00:54:12.791
Get out of my face. go.

1076
00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:13.625
Stop it!

1077
00:54:19.333 --> 00:54:20.457
What?

1078
00:54:20.458 --> 00:54:24.749
What the hell. Frank?

1079
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.624
Are you serious right now?

1080
00:54:26.625 --> 00:54:28.916
You're not just a
little bit suspicious?

1081
00:54:28.917 --> 00:54:30.457
Huh?

1082
00:54:30.458 --> 00:54:32.749
Suspicious of what?

1083
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:33.916
Oh my god.

1084
00:54:33.917 --> 00:54:35.499
All day you've been
asking. why did

1085
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:39.832
she bring us up here from
the ride up. just us?

1086
00:54:39.833 --> 00:54:40.916
Huh?

1087
00:54:40.917 --> 00:54:42.999
Who brought us up here?

1088
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.666
Whose cabin is it?

1089
00:54:44.667 --> 00:54:45.874
Hers.

1090
00:54:45.875 --> 00:54:47.916
Who owns that damn forest?

1091
00:54:47.917 --> 00:54:49.832
Her and her people.

1092
00:54:49.833 --> 00:54:51.332
What else am I
supposed to think?

1093
00:54:51.333 --> 00:54:53.041
[whispers]

1094
00:54:53.042 --> 00:54:55.082
You're supposed to think. OK?

1095
00:54:55.083 --> 00:54:56.832
And not start accusing
people of things

1096
00:54:56.833 --> 00:54:57.957
that you know nothing about.

1097
00:54:57.958 --> 00:55:00.292
[indistinct whispers]

1098
00:55:01.958 --> 00:55:03.749
Know nothing about. huh?

1099
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:04.957
What don't I know. huh?

1100
00:55:04.958 --> 00:55:06.082
What do you know. because...

1101
00:55:06.083 --> 00:55:06.957
[interposing voices]

1102
00:55:06.958 --> 00:55:08.541
Stop it. that's enough.

1103
00:55:08.542 --> 00:55:09.375
Go away!

1104
00:55:20.542 --> 00:55:24.957
Can somebody please
get me some water?

1105
00:55:24.958 --> 00:55:25.542
Yeah.

1106
00:55:32.417 --> 00:55:35.749
[deep exhale]

1107
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:45.999
All right. Marj. all
bullshit aside. shit!

1108
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.916
What the fuck is going on. huh?

1109
00:55:47.917 --> 00:55:49.874
Why did you bring
me and him up here?

1110
00:55:49.875 --> 00:55:51.082
I don't know what you're
talking about. Frank.

1111
00:55:51.083 --> 00:55:52.541
You know the fuck
I'm talking about.

1112
00:55:52.542 --> 00:55:53.166
Get away from me!

1113
00:55:53.167 --> 00:55:54.124
No. fuck that.

1114
00:55:54.125 --> 00:55:55.041
Get the fuck away from me.

1115
00:55:55.042 --> 00:55:55.916
Cut it out.

1116
00:55:55.917 --> 00:55:59.124
No. no. no. explain.

1117
00:55:59.125 --> 00:56:02.791
We're just trying to
figure this thing out. OK?

1118
00:56:02.792 --> 00:56:07.957
Something about this place
is causing this to happen.

1119
00:56:07.958 --> 00:56:09.666
Yeah.

1120
00:56:09.667 --> 00:56:12.207
I shot a little rabbit out
there. just hopping around.

1121
00:56:12.208 --> 00:56:14.499
But when I got to it. no meat.

1122
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:15.874
No meat.

1123
00:56:15.875 --> 00:56:18.874
Just fur and bonds
like in that story.

1124
00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.041
All right. what... what...

1125
00:56:20.042 --> 00:56:21.416
Remember. that story you told?

1126
00:56:21.417 --> 00:56:23.499
What does that
have to do with me?

1127
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.874
The fact that...

1128
00:56:24.875 --> 00:56:28.874
Marj. we just thought
that you know about it.

1129
00:56:28.875 --> 00:56:32.832
You know this
place. its history.

1130
00:56:32.833 --> 00:56:35.207
Whatever came for those
people in that story.

1131
00:56:35.208 --> 00:56:36.707
it's come for us.

1132
00:56:36.708 --> 00:56:39.457
Obviously. it's coming
at the motherfucking us.

1133
00:56:39.458 --> 00:56:42.541
but everything's OK with you.
but this is your cabin. right?

1134
00:56:42.542 --> 00:56:44.124
This is your forest. right?

1135
00:56:44.125 --> 00:56:46.082
Look. the same shit is
happening to me. OK?

1136
00:56:46.083 --> 00:56:48.791
I tried to get out of
here. to drive out of here

1137
00:56:48.792 --> 00:56:51.541
and I just kept driving and
driving around in circles.

1138
00:56:51.542 --> 00:56:54.957
Look. whatever's happening here.
it's happening to all of us.

1139
00:56:54.958 --> 00:56:56.499
That is bullshit.

1140
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:58.082
You're trying to spin
us around in circles.

1141
00:56:58.083 --> 00:56:59.249
Fuck off.

1142
00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:00.124
OK. will you knock
it off. Frank?

1143
00:57:00.125 --> 00:57:00.916
No. you knock it off.

1144
00:57:00.917 --> 00:57:01.541
You know what?

1145
00:57:01.542 --> 00:57:02.666
I will.

1146
00:57:02.667 --> 00:57:03.832
You know what I
would do. I'm out.

1147
00:57:03.833 --> 00:57:05.124
You two motherfuckers
can have it.

1148
00:57:05.125 --> 00:57:06.957
Best thing you said
was to get up out here.

1149
00:57:06.958 --> 00:57:08.582
so I'm going to the little
merry go round of yours.

1150
00:57:08.583 --> 00:57:10.041
and get the fuck off this thing.

1151
00:57:10.042 --> 00:57:11.457
You're not going alone.

1152
00:57:11.458 --> 00:57:12.791
Yeah. whatever.

1153
00:57:12.792 --> 00:57:14.166
Catch me if you can.

1154
00:57:14.167 --> 00:57:15.301
We're getting out
of here together.

1155
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:24.957
Whatever is happening here.
it's happening to all of us.

1156
00:57:24.958 --> 00:57:26.542
Come on. let's go.

1157
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.832
[wood creaking]

1158
00:57:31.833 --> 00:57:34.167
[keys clinking]

1159
00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:41.958
Give me the keys. Frank.

1160
00:57:45.583 --> 00:57:46.791
I got it. man.

1161
00:57:46.792 --> 00:57:48.791
Frank. you got one
arm is what you got.

1162
00:57:48.792 --> 00:57:52.082
Fuck off me. man.

1163
00:57:52.083 --> 00:57:53.624
Shit.

1164
00:57:53.625 --> 00:57:54.125
Fuck.

1165
00:57:58.292 --> 00:58:00.499
All right. how the fuck
we get out of here. Marj?

1166
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.916
Keep going. then turn right.

1167
00:58:03.917 --> 00:58:05.082
See. that's some bullshit.

1168
00:58:05.083 --> 00:58:06.832
See. we up out of here. man.

1169
00:58:06.833 --> 00:58:08.832
No. there look.

1170
00:58:08.833 --> 00:58:10.958
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1171
00:58:13.875 --> 00:58:15.000
It's not going to let us go.

1172
00:58:20.667 --> 00:58:25.124
No. fuck that.

1173
00:58:25.125 --> 00:58:27.332
What... what the hell
are you doing. Frank?

1174
00:58:27.333 --> 00:58:28.916
I'm getting us the
fuck out of here.

1175
00:58:28.917 --> 00:58:30.666
I don't think going
faster is going to help.

1176
00:58:30.667 --> 00:58:31.541
It's right in front of us.

1177
00:58:31.542 --> 00:58:32.166
Do you see it?

1178
00:58:32.167 --> 00:58:32.791
What?

1179
00:58:32.792 --> 00:58:33.208
See it?

1180
00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:33.916
What?

1182
00:58:35.667 --> 00:58:37.666
Damn it. Frank. what the fuck?

1183
00:58:37.667 --> 00:58:38.749
Did you see it?

1184
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:39.749
Did you see it?

1185
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:40.624
It was right in front of us.

1186
00:58:40.625 --> 00:58:41.291
You saw it?

1187
00:58:41.292 --> 00:58:42.957
You saw it?

1188
00:58:42.958 --> 00:58:44.166
What?

1189
00:58:44.167 --> 00:58:45.291

No.

1193

[heavy breathing]

1194
00:58:56.292 --> 00:58:57.208
Can we go back now?

1195
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.042
I think we already are.

1196

1200
00:59:28.083 --> 00:59:31.124
What are we supposed to do?

1201
00:59:31.125 --> 00:59:31.833
I don't know.

1202
00:59:34.708 --> 00:59:36.874
You don't?

1203
00:59:36.875 --> 00:59:40.082
Come on. I came up here
just the same as you guys.

1204
00:59:40.083 --> 00:59:42.916
OK. just because I know about
that creepy legend doesn't mean

1205
00:59:42.917 --> 00:59:44.250
it has anything to do with me.

1206
00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.207
Are you sure about that?

1207
00:59:48.208 --> 00:59:51.750
[music playing]

1208
00:59:53.667 --> 00:59:57.207
Maybe we should
burn it all down.

1209
00:59:57.208 --> 01:00:01.083
Like the whole damn thing on
a fire. the cabin. the woods.

1210
01:00:04.042 --> 01:00:06.249
I have a feeling it's not
going to let that happen.

[rumbling]

1212
01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:12.874
You feel it too. don't you?

1213
01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.042
Yeah. I do.

1214
01:00:18.958 --> 01:00:21.457
I think whatever it is it's...

1215
01:00:21.458 --> 01:00:23.082
It's becoming part of us.

1216
01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:27.291
It's... it's changing us.

1217
01:00:27.292 --> 01:00:33.916
I kept having these
dreams of Frank and you.

1218
01:00:33.917 --> 01:00:35.791
Yeah.

1219
01:00:35.792 --> 01:00:38.166
Yeah. I had them too.

1220
01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:41.208
I think they led me here to you.

1221
01:00:44.833 --> 01:00:45.791
Frank. what the fuck?

1222
01:00:45.792 --> 01:00:47.291
Don't worry he'll be back.

1223
01:00:47.292 --> 01:00:49.041
I know he'll be back.

1224
01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:50.457
Dude. this isn't funny. you
can't just keep doing this.

1225

How do you explain my
fucking arm is cut off?

Jon. but you can't even

fucking bullshit going on.

us. this is about all

getting out of this shit.

1282
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:33.249
Each time you kill here. brings
me life. just like your seed.

1283
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.167
Helps restore the
natural balance.

1284

[music playing]

1286
01:05:59.625 --> 01:06:01.416
What did I tell you?

1287
01:06:01.417 --> 01:06:03.207
Frank?

1288
01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:06.374
Who the fuck else you
been killing today. Jon?

1289
01:06:06.375 --> 01:06:08.332
Jesus Christ.

1290
01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:10.458
Yeah. I don't even think
he could help me with this.

1291
01:06:14.625 --> 01:06:16.666
You OK?

1292
01:06:16.667 --> 01:06:19.332
I'm a fucking head. Jon.

1293
01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:22.041
No. I'm not OK.

1294
01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:23.624
But what did I tell
you about her. huh?

1295
01:06:23.625 --> 01:06:25.291
It's not what you think.

1296
01:06:25.292 --> 01:06:27.166
Something out there has
possessed her. taken her over.

1297
01:06:27.167 --> 01:06:28.791
That thing I saw out
there wasn't Marj.

1298
01:06:28.792 --> 01:06:30.749
Hey. well. it looks like
it's your problem now.

1299
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.332
Shut up!

1300
01:06:32.333 --> 01:06:33.666
I mean I would try to
help you out there. buddy

1301
01:06:33.667 --> 01:06:35.291
but I'm trying to wrap
my head around this.

1302
01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:37.082
Well. you used to be like
the head of the class?

1303
01:06:37.083 --> 01:06:37.791
Get up.

1304
01:06:37.792 --> 01:06:39.082
You shut up!

1305

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.166
You are not helping.

[heavy breathing]

1309
01:06:48.667 --> 01:06:52.332
Jon. you're going to
have to kill her. man.

1310
01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:54.374
I'm not killing her.

1311
01:06:54.375 --> 01:06:56.457
We don't even know what
will happen if I do.

1312
01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:59.207
It's sure the only thing
we haven't tried. man.

1313
01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:03.291
Well. listen to me.
I'm not killing her.

1314
01:07:03.292 --> 01:07:05.332
You're such a pussy wet bitch.

1315
01:07:05.333 --> 01:07:07.541
You know that?

1316
01:07:07.542 --> 01:07:09.332
I've had enough of this.

1317
01:07:09.333 --> 01:07:10.499
What are you doing?

1318
01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.416
I mean. what can
you do to me now?

1319
01:07:12.417 --> 01:07:13.166
Right?

1320
01:07:13.167 --> 01:07:13.791

Jon. come on. man. let me out.

1334
01:07:36.083 --> 01:07:36.707

[groans]

1339
01:07:47.208 --> 01:07:47.749

Fuck me.

You're an asshole.

It's pointed in the
wrong direction.

1369
01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:33.499
I need you to kill Frank again.

1370
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.167

Look at me. Marjorie.

1378
01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:21.374
Let her go.

1379
01:10:21.375 --> 01:10:22.666
Let her go.

1380
01:10:22.667 --> 01:10:25.749
But being in her body
feels all so nice.

1381
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:26.874
You both know that.

[groans]

1383
01:10:31.292 --> 01:10:34.749
She has a duty to fulfill
passed down to her.

1384
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:38.666
You... you... you make
us come out here.

1385
01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:39.916
You... you forced us.

1386
01:10:39.917 --> 01:10:43.374
Oh. no I cannot force.
I can only accept.

[exhales]

1396
01:11:18.833 --> 01:11:22.582
Life. it's intertwined
with death.

1397
01:11:22.583 --> 01:11:25.707
One needs the other.

[shaky breathing]

1399
01:11:28.958 --> 01:11:31.666
Frank. is almost consumed.

1400
01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:34.541
Soon the bag limit
will be reached.

1401
01:11:34.542 --> 01:11:38.041
feeding can continue
uninterrupted.

1402
01:11:38.042 --> 01:11:39.582
Hey. Marj.

1403
01:11:39.583 --> 01:11:41.417
Marj. you want to
feed off of me?

1404
01:11:44.083 --> 01:11:46.791
I'm not much of a meal now.
more like a little topping

1405
01:11:46.792 --> 01:11:49.624

[groans]

1407
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.792
You were the easiest
to lure of them all.

Yeah. that's it. Marj.

1409
01:11:59.458 --> 01:12:00.000
Come here.

Oh. my Marj. you always
get your way. huh?

Get the fuck out. run.

1416
01:12:49.417 --> 01:12:50.999
What do you want?

[evil laughs]

1418

We're going to get out of here.

But your last kill is needed.

1465
01:14:59.125 --> 01:15:10.749
That will free us all. then you
will be a part of this land.

1466
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:16.666
A protector of it.

1467
01:15:16.667 --> 01:15:25.167
And when the time comes. your
child will be it's inheritor.

1468
01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:35.167
Because of you. this
place will live on.

1469
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:44.957
What do you want me to do?

1470
01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:51.166
We need one more.

1471
01:15:51.167 --> 01:15:52.083
Kill Frank.

1472
01:15:57.208 --> 01:16:00.999
He's just a head. what
do you want me to do?

1473
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.707
He must beat fully consumed.

1474
01:16:02.708 --> 01:16:05.083
[suspenseful music]

1475
01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:09.707
What?

1476
01:16:09.708 --> 01:16:12.042
[gasps]

1477
01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:21.667
[heavy breathing]

1478
01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:29.832
I don't know what choices
I made to bring me here.

1479
01:16:29.833 --> 01:16:32.667
[sniffles]

1480
01:16:33.417 --> 01:16:35.041
Or the choices you made.

1481
01:16:35.042 --> 01:16:38.583
[piano playing]

1482
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.666
There's only one way out for me.

1483
01:16:43.667 --> 01:16:47.042
[piano playing]

1484
01:16:52.042 --> 01:16:57.041
You want one more. here.

1485
01:16:57.042 --> 01:16:58.249
You reached your bag limit.

1486
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:58.957
No!

1487
01:16:58.958 --> 01:17:01.208
[gun shot]

1488
01:17:06.042 --> 01:17:07.124
I thought you'd stay.

1489
01:17:07.125 --> 01:17:09.875
[suspenseful music]

1490
01:17:35.333 --> 01:17:37.749
Hey.

1491
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:39.999
Huh.

1492

Jesus!

1493

[scoffs]

1494
01:17:49.917 --> 01:17:51.208
What the fuck are
we going to do?

1495
01:17:58.292 --> 01:18:00.916
I don't know.

1496
01:18:00.917 --> 01:18:02.416
Driving didn't work.

1497
01:18:02.417 --> 01:18:03.000
Hmm.

1498
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:07.500
Walk?

1499
01:18:10.958 --> 01:18:13.749
I might have a problem
with that there. genius.

1500
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:16.208
[chuckles]

1501
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.041
Yeah. you might.

1502

Yeah.

1503
01:18:30.417 --> 01:18:34.916
Sorry. to have to do
this to you. my friend.

[groans]

1505
01:18:42.875 --> 01:18:43.875
Let's go for a walk.

1506

Don't leave me.

Don't leave us.

1513
01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:16.917

01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:30.750
[gasps]

1516
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.458
The car almost hit us.

1517
01:19:36.292 --> 01:19:39.249
You sure you OK?

1518
01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:40.916

Aye. let me get a shot
of that tequila. man.

1522
01:19:48.042 --> 01:19:50.208
Mmh. hey.

1523
01:19:53.292 --> 01:19:55.000
[deep exhale]

1524
01:20:09.125 --> 01:20:10.499
Let me get a shot
of that. tequila.

1525
01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:13.458
[heavy breathing]

1526
01:20:21.958 --> 01:20:22.792
One more. one more.

1527
01:20:28.875 --> 01:20:32.166
Woo. you got the cheap shit.

1528
01:20:32.167 --> 01:20:34.166
Hey.

1529

[exhale]

1530
01:20:43.375 --> 01:20:45.375
[groans]

1531
01:21:00.875 --> 01:21:05.582
Time has no place here.

1532
01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:07.374
Try again.

1533
01:21:07.375 --> 01:21:11.041
They must be fully consumed.

1534
01:21:11.042 --> 01:21:12.291
Look at you.

1535
01:21:12.292 --> 01:21:16.374

I don't know.

1542
01:21:33.542 --> 01:21:34.500
There's that bullshit.

1543
01:21:37.083 --> 01:21:42.541
(SINGING) And we were alone
on that dark old night.

1544
01:21:42.542 --> 01:21:52.541
It's no wonder we surrender
to this house late at night.

1545
01:21:52.542 --> 01:21:53.125
Night.

1546
01:21:57.083 --> 01:22:02.957
And we were alone on
that dark old night.

1547
01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:11.957
It's no wonder we surrender
to this house late at night.

1548
01:22:11.958 --> 01:22:13.582
Night. night.

1549
01:22:13.583 --> 01:22:17.083
Ooh. yeah. yeah. yeah.
