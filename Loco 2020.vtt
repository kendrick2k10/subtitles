20
00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:54.040
You want me to fucking write it down?

21
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.000

26
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.898
Don't do this to me. please
help me. please don't do this.

27
00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:09.611
- Where's the fucking notebook?

28
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:12.213
- Okay. okay. okay. hold on. hold on.

29
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.450

It's nice to finally meet you.

36
00:02:55.157 --> 00:02:56.150
I don't want trouble.

37
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.793
- Yeah see. I kind of do.

38
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.930
Is that a fucking real rooster. man?

39
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.603
Big daddy. cane.

40
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.483
You know you're you're you're
pretty little girlfriend?

41
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.920
You're not going to be
able to protect her.

42
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.920
I took care of that.

43
00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:42.236
- Well. what do we have here?

44
00:03:42.236 --> 00:03:45.033
- Hey. I'm all good guys. I'm all good.

45
00:03:46.398 --> 00:03:47.490
Hey where are you going?

46
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.397
- I said I'm good.

47
00:03:48.397 --> 00:03:49.363
- No. we heard you.

Come on. identification.

49
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.770
- Think I'm gonna throw this to DEA.

50
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.040
Let's take him downtown.
- All right.

51
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.190
- Can I go now or like?

52
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.953
- Oh. you're not going anywhere.

53
00:04:11.953 --> 00:04:14.060
Aright. hand above your
head. hands above your head.

54
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.681
interlock your fingers. spread 'em!

55
00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:17.630
- You got a weapon on you. son?

56
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.003
- No!

57
00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:23.203
- Ah. what is this?

58
00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:24.603
What do you suppose that is?

59
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.353
- Look. that's not mine.

60
00:04:27.353 --> 00:04:28.960
The dude you just saw him--

61
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.998
- Oh. I guess I made a mistake. oops.

62
00:04:33.986 --> 00:04:34.883
- Hands above your head!

63
00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:37.086
Hands above your fucking head!

64
00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:39.150
- And now you've got assaulting a cop.

65
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.983
Oops.

66
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.040

You have the right to remain silent.

00:04:51.063 --> 00:04:53.689
anything you say can and
will be held against you

72
00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:54.712
in a court of law.

73
00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:56.283
You got a right to an attorney.

74
00:04:56.283 --> 00:04:58.783
You can't afford an attorney--

75
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.363
- Alex. honey. come on!

76
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.960
So how long did it take you this time?

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.930
- Two minutes

78
00:05:16.502 --> 00:05:17.597

- I swear I didn't do it.

85
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.920
- No. no. it's okay. it's okay. it's okay.

86
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.753
Just read it.

87
00:06:18.873 --> 00:06:19.706
- I don't want to change class.

88
00:06:19.706 --> 00:06:21.037
- It's where all the all
the smarter kids go. Alex.

89
00:06:21.037 --> 00:06:23.480
- But I don't want to be a smarter kid.

90
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.893
Please don't make me. Mom.

91
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.370
- Okay. okay.

92
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.093
You'll stay with Mrs. Gustavo.

93
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.463
- Are you mad at me?

94
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.493
- Of course not.

95
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.343
You listen to me. no matter
what I love you. okay?

96
00:06:45.242 --> 00:06:46.650
Why don't you go outside and
chase a bird or something?

97
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.800
I need some mommy time.

98
00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.873
- Dropped out one year later.

99
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.163
No criminal records.

100
00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:10.750
- You have nothing on me.

101
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.030
- Actually. Mr. Chesler. you
assaulted a police officer.

102
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.380
- I didn't touch him.

103
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.930
- Not according to his partner.

104
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.380
And you've got

105
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.473
Loco.

106
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.330
Kind of looks like bath salts. right?

107
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.913
I'm DEA. John Delaney.

108
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.560
I can make all this go away.

109
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.583
I help you. you help me.

110
00:07:49.586 --> 00:07:52.047
Or I can give you a try
with the boys in blue.

111
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.970
- I'm in trouble with the Talome's people.

112
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.773
- Talome.

113
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.667
- If he finds me. I'm dead.

114
00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.539
I'm gonna be okay.

115
00:09:42.513 --> 00:09:44.250
- Whoa slick.

116
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.410
It's wrong. but slick.

117
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.767
- I have no idea what
you're talking about.

118
00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:49.410
- Hey man. don't worry.

119
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.273
I haven't told anybody what you've done.

120
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.100
Smile for the camera.

121
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.183
- Shit.

122
00:09:57.183 --> 00:09:58.660
- Yeah. you got two options here.

123
00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:03.373
I could tell the owner and he's
he's a card carrying prick.

124
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.993
Or you can put the money
right back where you found.

125
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:10.053
- Prove it.

126
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.613
- That owner happens to be me.

127
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:20.700
You ever been in trouble
with the law. son?

128
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.200
- Look sir. I'm sorry.

129
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.033
- Sorry?

130
00:10:24.494 --> 00:10:26.853
Hell. sorry never paid for a fucking bill.

131
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.873
You need work?

132
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.473
I need someone to deliver
some glass for me.

133
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.513
- What?

134
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.430
- I'll give you an extra a hundred

135
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.730
when you get back with it.

136
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.853
- Glass. what is this?

137
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.393
- It's a delivery.

138
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.680
You need money. right?

139
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.230
I mean. you're stealing
from my fucking waitresses--

140
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.130
- Delivering what?

141
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.500
This is longitude and latitude?

142
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.410
- Hey. you in or you out?

143
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.913

- Here. delivery bitch.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:41.951
Don't break that shit.

146
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.573
- Do you know what all this is for?

147
00:11:44.466 --> 00:11:46.370
- What. Lester ain't tell you?

148
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.203
- Lester?

149
00:11:51.038 --> 00:11:52.705
- Here. put this on.

150
00:11:55.677 --> 00:11:57.200
You want to make bread. right?

151
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.033
- With a blindfold?

152
00:11:58.033 --> 00:11:59.250
- Man. if you don't put
the fucking blindfold--

153
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.290
- Dude. I'm sorry. I'm not gonna put a...

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.376
- Yo!

157
00:12:08.376 --> 00:12:09.209

00:12:09.209 --> 00:12:10.042
I'm not gonna put on a--

159
00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:10.875
- You don't get it?

160
00:12:13.047 --> 00:12:14.473
It's a fucking golden ticket. man.

161
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.080
Honestly. you fucking
look like you need one.

162
00:12:23.178 --> 00:12:24.761
What's it gonna be?

163
00:12:28.292 --> 00:12:29.125
Put the fucking blindfold on. man

164
00:12:29.125 --> 00:12:29.958

165
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:31.320
Put that in the fucking back.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.863
- Get out.

173
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.690
Can't believe Chef got me
driving you around anyway.

174
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.240
Like I'm some damn Lyft driver.

175
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.043
- Great. easy peasy. right?

176
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.120
Go drop that in the kitchen.

Don't touch anything!

180
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.443
- All business. I like that.

181
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.133
Let me show you something.

182
00:14:43.553 --> 00:14:45.380
- Is this the part where you kill me?

183
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.213
- Maybe.

184
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.900
It's just for protection.

185
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.330
- Sorry. I don't. I don't play with fire.

186
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.730
- Yeah. well me neither.

187
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.033
Fire's for amateurs.

188
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.513
So. this is where I do all my cooking.

189
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.810
You got your test tubes. you got your--

190
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.793
- Volumetric glass. porous silicate.

191
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.393
conical flasks.

192
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.348
You're a drug cook.

193
00:15:20.924 --> 00:15:22.960
- That's very good.

194
00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.093
I'm one of the best.

195
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.160
- I can't be here. I can't.

196
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.410
- Hey. you come this far.

197
00:15:30.349 --> 00:15:31.182
It's not so bad.

198
00:15:31.182 --> 00:15:32.015
- It is bad.

199
00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:33.923
- Hey. you need a job. right?

200
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.420
This is me helping you out.

201
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.253
- I don't need that kind of help.

202
00:15:38.253 --> 00:15:39.600
- It don't look that way to me.

203
00:15:44.409 --> 00:15:48.620
- Don't lie to me. what's
your day job again?

204
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.160
- You get a day job when
you're not good at anything.

205
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.263
- Didn't you inherit
property from your mom?

206
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.085
- Yeah. that's all we had.

207
00:15:56.085 --> 00:15:56.918
- Where is it?

208
00:15:56.918 --> 00:15:59.168
- She was in the hospital
for a long ass time

209
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:02.260
and they kicked me out in a week.

210
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.830
Bank wants to break even. I guess.

211
00:16:30.643 --> 00:16:32.730
- I can help with those.

212
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.480
- I know honey. I think I
just need a little more help

213
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.873
than math right now.

214
00:16:42.373 --> 00:16:43.206
Okay.

215
00:17:00.311 --> 00:17:03.449
- Don't worry about it. I got you.

216
00:17:03.449 --> 00:17:04.282
- Hello.

217
00:17:04.282 --> 00:17:05.263
- Nice to meet you too.

218
00:17:07.195 --> 00:17:08.028
- Thank you.

219
00:17:08.028 --> 00:17:09.063
- Don't thank me yet.

220
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.800
I saw you talking to Lester.

221
00:17:13.734 --> 00:17:15.013
What were you guys talking about?

222
00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.823
- I didn't know you knew him.

223
00:17:18.995 --> 00:17:20.595
- You didn't answer my question.

224
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.110
What were you guys talking about?

225
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.650
- Nothing.

226
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.360
Don't you work here?

227
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.943
- I pick up shifts.

228
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.450
Lester doesn't just talk to anybody

229
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.170
and he doesn't do small talk.

230
00:17:37.993 --> 00:17:40.365
- What's it to you?

231
00:17:40.365 --> 00:17:41.198
- A job.

232
00:17:43.363 --> 00:17:44.450
I think you should take it.

233
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:45.590
- Really?

234
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.500
Who made you my career counselor?

235
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.130
- Whatever he offered you. you need it.

236
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.130
I've seen you around here before
looking like a lost puppy.

237
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.240
Every single time. it's
kind of depressing.

238
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.559
- Why don't you work with him?

239
00:17:57.559 --> 00:17:58.392
- I do.

240
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.533
- Hey.
- Hey. so you're in.

241
00:18:34.416 --> 00:18:36.553
- Well. I mean. I didn't
bring a blindfold.

242
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.580
- So before we start. two rules.

243
00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.730
Rule number one. if you
tell anyone what I'm about

244
00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:50.603
to teach you. I'm going
to kill you. myself.

245
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.393
You got it?

246
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.473
- You don't have to worry
about me. man. I'm good.

247
00:18:57.858 --> 00:18:58.691
I got it.

248
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:01.843
- Rule number two.

249
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.393
stay away from Lydia.

250
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.070
I need you to take this
seriously. not personally.

251
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.903
do you understand me?

252
00:19:10.903 --> 00:19:12.130
- How do you know that--

253
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.963
- Do you understand me?

254
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.790
- Look who it is. delivery bitch.

255
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.850
- Alex. my name is Alex.

256
00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.000
- Yo Skaggs. you sure
we can we trust fool?

257
00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.803
- I don't know. Alex. can we trust you?

258
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.230
- Why do we even need him?

259
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.640
You were teachin' me how to cook.

260
00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.680
- 'Cause last time I taught you a lesson

261
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.330
you nearly blew up the place. man.

262
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.390
- That was one time.

263
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.990
- You can't even cook eggs. bro.

264
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.890
- Jason. you distribute. right?

265
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.930
The more cooks. the more
product you guys have to sling.

266
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.710
It means more money for everybody. got it?

267
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.573
- Yeah. got it.

268
00:20:08.498 --> 00:20:09.953
- But he looks like a fucking snitch.

269
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.663
You even got that snitch face.

270
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.650
- Snitch face?
- I'm sorry. bitch face.

271
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.144
How bout that?

272
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.843
- He's clean. trust me.

273
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.840
- We'll see then.

274
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.273
- All right. let's get started.

275
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:44.863
- Just us?

276
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.610
So you gonna break this down for me or?

277
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.203
- The kids call it Loco.

278
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.440
- What's that?

279
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.083
- This is the recipe.

280
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.833
This stays with me at all times.

281
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.213
Got it?

282
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.060
Wow.

283
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:24.460
You want to hear the kicker?

284
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:29.670
This beautiful baby is completely legal.

285
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.200
- Ain't no shit like it.

286
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.720
- How is that even remotely--

287
00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.880
- Bath salt and other similar compounds.

288
00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:39.700
they have qualities that
make them narcotics by law.

289
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.973
But a good cook is a scientist.

290
00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.700
Certain chemical reactions
can change the composite

291
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.693
of a substance substantially.
even completely.

292
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:52.990
Make those chemicals undetectable.

293
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.443
yet adequately potent.

294
00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:58.923
Even more so in our case.

295
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.103
- That's crazy.

296
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.490
- It's not crazy.

297
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.413
It's Loco.

298
00:23:08.591 --> 00:23:09.424
Aw. shit.

299
00:23:09.424 --> 00:23:11.610
Aye. Lydia. you got try this shit.

300
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:12.883
- No. I'm good.

301
00:23:12.883 --> 00:23:15.057
- It's a good batch. just try it.

302
00:23:15.057 --> 00:23:17.128
- I don't want to try it.
- Try it!

303
00:23:17.128 --> 00:23:18.289
- I don't want to try it!

304
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:19.122
- Just take one hit. just fucking try it!

305
00:23:19.122 --> 00:23:20.172
- Why are you so worried about what I do?

306
00:23:20.172 --> 00:23:21.770
Why are you so pissed about me trying it?

307
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.320
- Hey guys. hey. hey. Jason.
watch your mouth. man.

308
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.870
Look. don't disrespect her. okay.

309
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.002
If she doesn't want to
do it. she doesn't do it.

310
00:23:29.002 --> 00:23:30.544
- Fine.

311
00:23:30.544 --> 00:23:32.463
Shut the fuck up. then.

312
00:23:32.463 --> 00:23:34.120
- What about you. Alex?

313
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.970
A good cook always tastes his recipe.

314
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.828
- Oh. I'm good. I don't. I don't do drugs.

315
00:23:40.828 --> 00:23:42.664
- I don't do drugs.

316
00:23:42.664 --> 00:23:45.160
It's cool. though. get
the fuck outta here.

317
00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.585
- If Lydia doesn't do it. why should I?

318
00:24:40.575 --> 00:24:42.200
- Unlock it.

319
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.033
- You're not allowed to--

320
00:24:43.033 --> 00:24:45.533
- Don't make me ask you again.

321
00:25:01.538 --> 00:25:02.680
Is that the formula there?

322
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.480
- Are you not listening to my story?

323
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.153
- That Lydia?

324
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:16.783
- Yes.

325
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:21.443
- I don't have time for this shit.

326
00:25:22.674 --> 00:25:23.507
What's the formula?

327
00:25:23.507 --> 00:25:24.430
- It's complicated.

328
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.030
Page of fucking scribbles.

329
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.160
- And where's the notebook. huh?

330
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.463
I need to stop this prick.

331
00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.300
You really want to help
a guy who takes advantage

332
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.513
of lost kids like you?

333
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.040
- He's not so bad.

334
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.983
- He's a fake. a con artist. a liar.

335
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.163
- You know him?

336
00:25:43.556 --> 00:25:45.656
- Look. I've been on this case for months.

337
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:50.557
I'm this close. what's the formula?

338
00:25:50.557 --> 00:25:52.990
- No. I cooked with Lester
like a handful of times.

339
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.160
You really think he'd let me
anywhere near that notebook?

340
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.850
- Where's the kitchen. then?

341
00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:57.900
The den. where is it?

342
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.280
- You didn't have to
take that shit. you know.

343
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.570
- I didn't take shit.

344
00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:12.170
There's wasn't enough
time to take fucking...

345
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.230
- Can you guys reel him
the fuck in. please?

346
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.397
- Yeah. hey.

347
00:26:15.397 --> 00:26:16.480
- What's up. Chef?

348
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.660
- Hey. knock it off. knock it off.

349
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.693
Jason's going to take
you out in the field.

350
00:26:20.693 --> 00:26:23.740
He's going to show you the
distribution side of things.

351
00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.410
Okay?
- Right now?

352
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.340
- Yes. right now. come on. time is money.

353
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.190
Let's go. let's go!

354
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.780
- Let's go delivery bitch.

355
00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.610
- I like that better than snitch face.

356
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:32.737
- I don't give a fuck.

357
00:27:23.189 --> 00:27:24.439
- Where are we?

358
00:27:28.369 --> 00:27:30.210
Have we been selling all night?

359
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:32.760
- Come on. you know. we
got to get that paper full.

360
00:27:35.374 --> 00:27:36.833
We night hunt. Alex.

361
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.860
- Aw man. I haven't even
seen shit like this money.

362
00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.059
- I know you haven't.

363
00:27:44.059 --> 00:27:45.160
That's some real money.

364
00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:45.993
- Jesus.

365
00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.280
- She probably sold more than Loco.

366
00:27:50.605 --> 00:27:52.783
- What?
- Don't worry about it.

367
00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.980
- Oh Chef. see that?

368
00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.820
Lydia had another big night!

369
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.230
Listen. if I had tits and ass like her.

370
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.425
I'd probably be selling--

371
00:28:01.425 --> 00:28:03.008
- Enough is enough!

372
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.910
This is bullshit money.

373
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:10.530
This is kid stuff.

374
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.100
- Don't worry about me. I got it.

375
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.420
- Maybe if you stop using it

376
00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.190
and you start fucking
selling it. I don't know.

377
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:16.120
you might make another enough--

378
00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.264
- Maybe if you shut the fuck
up when you're not being--

379
00:28:24.739 --> 00:28:28.343
- If you don't figure this out.
I'll figure it out for you.

380
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.313
You got it?

381
00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:52.210
Get some sleep boys.

382
00:29:03.969 --> 00:29:04.802
- Guess you did all right.

383
00:29:04.802 --> 00:29:06.311
- Oh. all right?

384
00:29:06.311 --> 00:29:07.411
You guess?
- I guess.

385
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.083
- I fucking know.

386
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.214
- So what's up. we hitting
the strip club. strip club?

387
00:29:13.214 --> 00:29:14.490
Hitting the strip club?

388
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.620
Come on. stripper ass. come on baby.

389
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.530
I'm out.
- Bye!

390
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.900
Bitches here I come!

391
00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:27.603
- Hey. do you want to grab some food?

392
00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.800
Well. what do people
talk about besides eggs?

393
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.633
- I don't know.

394
00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.073
You tell me. I'm not much of a sharer. so.

395
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:39.133
- What's your family like?

396
00:29:40.836 --> 00:29:42.867
- I have a little brother
I'm taking care of. so.

397
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.890
That's all you got to know.

398
00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.590
- And that led to Lester?
- Joey didn't lead to shit.

399
00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.493
This is my decision. okay.

400
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.873
- Joey. sounds like a cute kid.

401
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.093
- He is.

402
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:08.390
We call him our Christmas miracle.

403
00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.150
- He was born on Christmas?

404
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:12.870
- Yeah. it's cliche. right?

405
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.620
- No. it saves money on presents.

406
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.823
- Boom. exactly!

407
00:30:20.543 --> 00:30:21.793
What about you?

408
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.140
What's your family like?

409
00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.173
- My mom.

410
00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:34.693
she died

411
00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.813
a few weeks ago.

412
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.210
- What was she like?

413
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:44.653
- Selfless.

414
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:48.253
Encouraging.

415
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.810
Like. I was her only child.

416
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:52.903
so she always made sure I had everything.

417
00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.370
I love her very much.

418
00:31:07.806 --> 00:31:08.889
I found this.

419
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.113
This necklace.

420
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.223
the only thing left that was.

421
00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.880
was ever really hers and me.

422
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.954
- What about your dad?

423
00:31:38.954 --> 00:31:40.954
- I don't even remember.

424
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:43.250
Save it for another day.

425
00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.093
- What?

426
00:31:46.093 --> 00:31:47.190
I mean like--
- Please.

427
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:50.323
- Okay.

428
00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.560
- It went on like that for a bit.

429
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.020
I need to make sure she's safe.

430
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.223
I'm not giving you shit until I know that.

431
00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.330
- Good luck tonight.

432
00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.180
- How much longer are you keeping me here?

433
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.620
- You still haven't told
me where the kitchen is.

434
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.483
- I don't know.

435
00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.240
I went to this corner.
they blindfolded me.

436
00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.490
I showed up at the house.

437
00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.000
It's the same thing every time.

438
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.280
- We put them away you off the hook.

439
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:32.440
- Talome's still gonna
be after me and Lydia.

440
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.690
- That name again.

441
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.623
- You really haven't heard about this guy?

442
00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:38.543
- He's a drug kingpin.

443
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.330
He's like the holy ghost of the streets.

444
00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.130
People are fucking terrified of him.

445
00:33:44.995 --> 00:33:45.828
And he runs everything.

446
00:33:45.828 --> 00:33:48.450
He takes a cut of everything
from all the local businesses.

447
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:49.963
promising them protection.

448
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.700
All the drug dealers hate him.

449
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.270
They want them out and
some of them I've tried.

450
00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:59.840
but he has eyes and ears
on every single corner.

451
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.140
- So why haven't the cops brought him down

452
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.700
if he's so everywhere?

453
00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.440
- Because nobody knows what
the fuck he looks like.

454
00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.633
He gets everyone else to
do his dirty work for him.

455
00:34:32.083 --> 00:34:33.110
No one will ever turn him in.

456
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.570
No one will ever give him up.

457
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:39.480
He just destroys their lives.

458
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.980
And he doesn't come after you.

459
00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.270
He goes after everyone you love.

460
00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.810
- Who's this?

461
00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:50.643
- Hi.

462
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:54.140
We're just finishing up
a little transaction.

463
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:57.373
Your stuff's in the car.
I'll talk to you later.

464
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.233
- Wait. what?

465
00:35:03.233 --> 00:35:04.463
- I'll talk to you later.

466
00:35:09.822 --> 00:35:12.309
- Okay.

467
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.790
Hey you. what's going on?

468
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.623
Who was that?

469
00:36:06.623 --> 00:36:07.777
- No one don't walk so close to me.

470
00:36:07.777 --> 00:36:09.090
- No. he's definitely somebody.

471
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:09.923
I saw him grab--

472
00:36:09.923 --> 00:36:11.230
- We can't be seen together.

473
00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:14.150
- What?

474
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.290
- What is so hard to comprehend. Alex?

475
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.053
We can't be seen together.

476
00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.781
- So what am I just. just breakfast.

477
00:36:22.781 --> 00:36:24.569
- What about it?

478
00:36:24.569 --> 00:36:26.969
We're working together
to make money. that's it.

479
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.833
- Seriously?

480
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.823
Hey Chef!

481
00:36:48.486 --> 00:36:49.563
What's cooking?

482
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.897
You know. 'cause.

483
00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:55.683
What's up?

484
00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.583
- You broke rule number two.

485
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:03.030
- Broke. I'm sorry. I didn't--

486
00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.778
- Let me give them to you fresh. huh.

487
00:37:08.778 --> 00:37:09.611
- Get off me!

488
00:37:09.611 --> 00:37:11.133
- Stay away from Lydia.

489
00:37:12.916 --> 00:37:14.090
- We just go to the diner. it's not--

490
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:17.820
- I don't need you to go near her. right.

491
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.530
I will destroy you. that is a promise.

492
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.700
- Look. it's not like--

493
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.623
- Shut up!

494
00:37:23.657 --> 00:37:26.670
Now I see and I hear everything.

495
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:31.280
When you eat. I know when you
to sleep. I fucking know it.

496
00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.557
I know everything.

497
00:37:37.143 --> 00:37:39.003
I don't need you to go near her.

498
00:37:43.119 --> 00:37:45.619
You're incredibly replaceable.

499
00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.750
- This is textbook manipulation.

500
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.030
You're smart kid. you can see that?

501
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:57.460
- He's just protective
of Lydia. that's all.

502
00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.410
- What about Jason?

503
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:02.203
Jason.

504
00:38:04.284 --> 00:38:05.117
Talk.

505
00:38:13.896 --> 00:38:15.810
- Get off me!

506
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.477
Get off me. get off!

507
00:38:24.566 --> 00:38:27.700
- So I'm gonna ask you again.

508
00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:28.800
where's your supplier?

509
00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.003
- I told you. I bought it dickhead.

510
00:38:37.856 --> 00:38:38.773
- Dickhead?

511
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:42.650
My name is Demetrius.

512
00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.543
Now. you bought it from?

513
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.863
Silence?

514
00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.690
This here. this little piggy right here.

515
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.220
went to the market.

516
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.230
You bought it from?

517
00:39:05.098 --> 00:39:06.360
You're gonna spit on my
new shines. just like that?

518
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.370
- Fuck your shoes!
- Fuck my shoes.

519
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:09.210
Fuck my shoes.

520
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.370
I got a brand new shine. fuck my my shoes.

521
00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:12.702
Hammer time.

522
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:18.663
I know.

523
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.093
Let me see this.

524
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.460
Dixie. hole that for me. would you?

525
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:34.170
This little piggy had roast. right?

526
00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:35.443
Let me see.

527
00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:38.572
- Whoa. whoa. whoa.

528
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.193
Fuck you!

529
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.823
- Do me a favor. kiss this hammer.

530
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.973
Actually. fuck it.

531
00:39:55.971 --> 00:39:58.221
Hammer mother fucking time!

532
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.943
- Lester. what are we going to do?

533
00:40:06.229 --> 00:40:07.807
- Well. we've been lazy.

534
00:40:07.807 --> 00:40:09.107
You couldn't count on him.

535
00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.033
So fucking stupid.

536
00:40:14.805 --> 00:40:16.965
That pig probably squealed.

537
00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:22.110
- It's all you fucking care about.

538
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.580
Jason is dead!

539
00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.680
- Clean him up. I can smell him from here.

540
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:32.873
- Go to hell.

541
00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:40.123
- Go ahead. honey. where you gonna go?

542
00:40:42.752 --> 00:40:45.109
Shut up. shut it!

543
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:08.740
- Where's Jason's body?

544
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:10.793
- No clue.

545
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.240
Not on the news either.

546
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.820
Aren't you guys supposed to be
all over that kind of thing?

547
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.561
- What's his full name?

548
00:41:19.561 --> 00:41:20.394
- I don't know.

549
00:41:20.394 --> 00:41:21.227
- Don't fuck with me.

550
00:41:21.227 --> 00:41:22.820
- Look. we weren't buds.

551
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.453
He did his thing. I did mine.

552
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:31.127
- You can lie all you want.
it's not gonna save you.

553
00:41:32.257 --> 00:41:33.243
- I don't know shit.

554
00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.153
- And Lydia?

555
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:39.797
- Hey. what's up?

556
00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:41.350
This is the batch?

557
00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:42.980
What's wrong?

558
00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:44.753
- I'm so stupid. I should've known.

559
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.320
- What are you talking about?

560
00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:49.953
- She's working with Talome.

561
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:54.193
- You high?

562
00:41:54.193 --> 00:41:55.026
Come on. she not--

563
00:41:55.026 --> 00:41:56.073
- I'm not high.

564
00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.093
You see. I'm thinking perfectly clear.

565
00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:03.850
She bailed on us. now she's screwing us.

566
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:04.910
Hey. hey!

567
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.093
I don't know what's going on.

568
00:42:08.449 --> 00:42:10.043
I mean quiet doesn't add up.

569
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.540
Maybe she's after the formula.

570
00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.990
Did you give her the formula?

571
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:18.690
- Oh. you think I have
a photographic memory?

572
00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:20.537
I mean. I can list off
the ingredients you want.

573
00:42:20.537 --> 00:42:24.953
but it's this notebook that
makes Loco. okay. period.

574
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:32.910
- Answer the question.

575
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.263
Did you give her the formula?

576
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:38.263
- No.

577
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:49.083
- Well. you don't know what
this business does to a person.

578
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:55.491
Look. I just need you to follow her.

579
00:42:55.491 --> 00:42:56.450
- You want me to stay away from her

580
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:57.950
and now you want me stalking her?

581
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:59.900
- Pay attention!
- I'm not doing that.

582
00:43:05.813 --> 00:43:09.730
- Well. I guess all three
of us are going down.

583
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.823
Yeah.

584
00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:25.793
Oh. he's good.

585
00:43:28.024 --> 00:43:28.860
- What do you mean?

586
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.710
- Knowing you have a thing for Lydia.

587
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:33.890
He never stops.

588
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:36.050
- You got it all figured out.

589
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.863
- Trust me. he's got you wrapped
around his little finger.

590
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:42.933
Think about it.

591
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.760
He's brought you into a
dangerous and volatile business

592
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.143
when you were vulnerable and broke.

593
00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.480
He knows you're hot for Lydia.

594
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.290
He convinces you she's lying.

595
00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:57.540
the only person on earth
that you care about.

596
00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:01.463
So all you have to rely upon his him.

597
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.067
Pure manipulation.

598
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:23.210
- Look like you need a friend.

599
00:45:24.318 --> 00:45:26.830
- Lester know I been hanging out here?

600
00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:27.910
- I mean. this place
might be his money front.

601
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:30.807
but I don't think he watches it 24/7.

602
00:45:31.769 --> 00:45:32.753
And he didn't send me.

603
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.640
You know. a hi usually works too.

604
00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.653
- Sorry. I just.

605
00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.530
I can't stop thinking about
what they did to Jason.

606
00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.493
It was just so vicious.

607
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.110
And then it's not even on TV.

608
00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.910
It's like it never fucking happened.

609
00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.233
- Yeah. I know.

610
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:58.930
- What are you doing here?

611
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:01.433
- It's cheap.

612
00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:06.330
- So you still see Lester?

613
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.163
- Sometimes.

614
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.263
You?
- No.

615
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.593
Not if I can help it.

616
00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.230
I'm done with everything.

617
00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:17.340
Can't even fucking sleep.

618
00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:21.070
Feel like I'm gonna be next.

619
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:24.183
- Yeah. it's that way for me too.

620
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:29.403
- Thanks for the shake.

621
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:32.143
- If you ever need anything.

622
00:46:33.403 --> 00:46:34.820
I know.

623
00:46:51.005 --> 00:46:55.540
- Whew. didn't realize this
was so touching. Romeo.

624
00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:56.440
- Are we finished?

625
00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.700
- Didn't expect to hear
a love story. that's all.

626
00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.820
Lester. I imagine he's gonna gut you

627
00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.793
as soon as he finds out.

628
00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:11.270
- I'm just helping her.

629
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:12.890
- Helping her?

630
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.624
Is that what kids are
calling it these days?

631
00:47:15.624 --> 00:47:16.540
- Okay. I don't know
what happened between you

632
00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:19.500
and Lester. but I don't need
to be in the middle of it.

633
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.333
- It's too late.

634
00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.253
- Does anyone know you're here?

635
00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.140
- No.

636
00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.433
- Good. so give it to me.

637
00:47:50.206 --> 00:47:51.367
I'm gonna need to get more.

638
00:47:51.367 --> 00:47:53.440
These little bags. bullshit.

639
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.540
- Well. it's not easy.

640
00:47:55.415 --> 00:47:56.460
I'm doing what I can.

641
00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.624
- You need to try harder.

642
00:47:58.624 --> 00:48:00.717
You understand what the
fuck I'm telling you?

643
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.220
- Yeah.

644
00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.053
- Good.

645
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.970
- Can we talk somewhere else?

646
00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.443
- Enjoy the music.

647
00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.810
- She meets with this guy
in the middle of the day.

648
00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:05.283
Near the diner.

649
00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:09.260
She always hands him a brown paper bag.

650
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.803
- What's in the bag?
- Loco.

651
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:18.860
- Not possible.

652
00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.090
Where would she be getting it?

653
00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:22.273
- Off the streets.

654
00:49:24.092 --> 00:49:26.160
- No. the stuff we pushed.
it'd be sold by now.

655
00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.493
It'd be used up.

656
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:31.343
- Her own stash?

657
00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:33.923
- Keep on this.

658
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.470
Losing Jason and Lydia.

659
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:39.890
I've got to find some new distributors.

660
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:40.723
- I can do it if--

661
00:49:40.723 --> 00:49:43.280
- No. no. no. it'll be handled.

662
00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.093
You just keep digging deeper.

663
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.353
- Stay here.

664
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.130
Who's your favorite basketball player?

665
00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:01.536
- My favorite basketball
player is Michael Jordan.

666
00:50:01.536 --> 00:50:03.450
- Hey. do you want to go
for basketball real quick?

667
00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:05.023
- Yeah.
- Okay. go ahead.

668
00:50:11.012 --> 00:50:13.280
- So I'm starting to believe

669
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.730
that you are stalking me now.

670
00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.920
- And if I was?

671
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:19.770
- What are you doing here. Alex?

672
00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:22.140
- You mentioned this park
before and not to sell near

673
00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:24.180
here. cause you. you take Joey.

674
00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.263
- Oh. it's nice to know you pay attention.

675
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:28.153
- To you.

676
00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:36.363
- I force him to come outside
so he can make friends.

677
00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:38.360
- How's that going?

678
00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:41.763
- Honestly.

679
00:50:42.636 --> 00:50:44.920
it's not that good.

680
00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.840
I mean. he's really stubborn.

681
00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.440
He's too smart for his own good

682
00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:52.800
so kids make fun of him
at school. call him weird.

683
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.633
stuff like that.

684
00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:57.540
- Yeah. I used to get that all the time.

685
00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.750
- You?

686
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:59.770
- Oh for sure. yeah.

687
00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:01.770
There was a time when I was a real geek.

688
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.033
- Was?

689
00:51:07.217 --> 00:51:10.120
- I was thinking though. we
should grab dinner later.

690
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:13.870
Talk about a weird I was.

691
00:51:20.847 --> 00:51:23.401
the phone I got issues

692
00:51:32.005 --> 00:51:33.560
I've had a thing for you for so long.

693
00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.393
- Oh shut up.

694
00:51:34.393 --> 00:51:36.770
- It's ridiculous.
- Shut up. you're lying.

695
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:37.713
- No. it's true.

696
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.560
- So then why didn't you say
anything to me before all this?

697
00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.313
- I don't know.

698
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:48.750
You're. you're you. like look at you.

699
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.623
- What?
- Lydia.

700
00:51:53.004 --> 00:51:54.312
- What does that even mean?

701
00:51:54.312 --> 00:51:55.562
- I don't know.

702
00:51:57.233 --> 00:51:59.183
Just always thought you were beautiful.

703
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:01.463
Fascinating.

704
00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.153
I was right.

705
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.153
- I'm.

706
00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.503
I'm not any of those things.

707
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:12.943
- You are to me.

708
00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:19.380
- You don't even know me. Alex.

709
00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:23.133
- Well. I know you love
your brother fiercely.

710
00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:26.450
You passed up on some big
sister time to hang with me.

711
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:28.850
That's pretty cool in my book.

712
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:29.860
- Oh please. first of all.

713
00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.250
I was just trying to clear my head.

714
00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:35.440
- Oh. so that's what this was?
- Yeah. exactly.

715
00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.913
- Served my purpose.
- Yeah.

716
00:52:38.679 --> 00:52:39.512
No. I.

717
00:52:42.143 --> 00:52:43.523
I do like you Alex.

718
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:47.490
It's just the people that I care about

719
00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:51.210
don't really last.

720
00:52:59.194 --> 00:53:00.527
As soon as I can

721
00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.600
I'm getting Joey and
we're getting out of this

722
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.913
fucked up town.

723
00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:09.183
One day.

724
00:53:16.396 --> 00:53:17.563
- Let me help.

725
00:53:20.224 --> 00:53:22.874
- You don't know what you're
talking about right now.

726
00:53:26.793 --> 00:53:27.626
- I do.

727
00:53:34.324 --> 00:53:37.289
the phone I got issues

728
00:54:35.462 --> 00:54:37.530
- We call him our Christmas miracle.

729
00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:39.534
- He was born on Christmas?

730
00:54:39.534 --> 00:54:40.784
Yeah.

731
00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:53.913
- No names.

732
00:54:56.253 --> 00:55:01.253
What are you up to?

733
00:55:02.868 --> 00:55:03.701
- Alex?

734
00:55:16.929 --> 00:55:18.103
- Hey. what's up?

735
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:23.220
- Nothing. I was seeing where you went.

736
00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.163
- Sorry. nature called.

737
00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.200
- Did you put the toilet seat down?

738
00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.150
- Duh!

739
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:32.400
My momma raised me right.

740
00:55:42.482 --> 00:55:43.790
I know you're trying to get him out.

741
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:46.160
but whatever it is you're doing.

742
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.610
is it really the best way--

743
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:50.823
- I'm exploring all my
options. Alex. okay?

744
00:55:52.455 --> 00:55:53.620
- What about the guy at the dinner?

745
00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.230
- What about him?

746
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:56.063
He's nobody.

747
00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.180
Why does it matter?

748
00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.030
- No. it doesn't.

749
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:04.863
- Great. then we don't
have to talk about it.

750
00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:08.403
- Okay.

751
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:15.870
I think it's dangerous to be bringing

752
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:18.020
one of Talome's guys through the diner.

753
00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:19.343
- And what if he was?

754
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:23.290
With Talome. what would you say?

755
00:56:35.547 --> 00:56:37.617
- Lester thinks Lydia's with Talome?

756
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:40.670
You think Lydia is playing both sides.

757
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.310
Meanwhile. you're spying behind her back

758
00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:47.833
while you're practically inside
her. Jesus fucking Christ.

759
00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:52.933
Tell me about the guy at the diner.

760
00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.190
The one with Lydia.

761
00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.490
Any tattoos?

762
00:56:58.490 --> 00:57:01.730
Height. eye color?

763
00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:03.140
- He was white.

764
00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.647
He was like 5'11.

765
00:57:05.647 --> 00:57:06.480
You know. I really didn't get to gaze

766
00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.680
into his eyes there. John.

767
00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.770
- Don't get smart.

768
00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:10.290
- You think everything I
tell you is total bullshit

769
00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:11.630
then why the hell are we still talking?

770
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:13.830
- So you looked through
her shit. then what?

771
00:57:24.795 --> 00:57:26.962
- See you later with more.

772
00:58:06.623 --> 00:58:07.893
- I suck at this. man.

773
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.860
- Open the door!

774
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:11.693
- Like bad.

775
00:58:13.612 --> 00:58:14.470
- What are you doing here?

776
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:16.087
- Nothing I'm just. I'm just--

777
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.730
- Leave me alone. I never
want to see you again.

778
00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:20.563
- Why?

779
00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:22.530
- Just stop please!

780
00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:23.960
- I'm trying to protect you.

781
00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.280
- Trying to protect me?

782
00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:26.930
Do you want to end up like Jason?

783
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:36.760
- You're right. I'm sorry.

784
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.970
I'll leave you alone.
- Good.

785
00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:42.510
- Now get out of my face and
never see me again. got it?

786
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:43.343
- Got it.

787
00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:57.710
Hey!
- Don't ask.

788
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:58.865
- What the hell is going on?

789
00:58:58.865 --> 00:59:00.240
- You don't take direction that well.

790
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.060
- If you're in trouble. let me help you.

791
00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.954
- Alex. I can't.

792
00:59:03.954 --> 00:59:05.260
- Oh yeah. you can trust me.

793
00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:06.710
- You don't understand.

794
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:08.933
- Please. for me.

795
00:59:10.922 --> 00:59:11.755
I want to help.

796
00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:18.040
- I'm working with the FBI.

797
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:22.743
- How did this hap--

798
00:59:22.743 --> 00:59:25.470
- Alex. it's this or let
Joey be trapped with my mom

799
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:26.893
for the rest of his life.

800
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.193
They fucking cornered me.
- When?

801
00:59:33.310 --> 00:59:34.190
- I was...

802
00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.110
I dealing Loco on
Columbia and Dover street

803
00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:41.250
and these two guys pulled
up. got out of the car.

804
00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:43.613
flashed their badges and
told me to get in the back.

805
00:59:46.338 --> 00:59:48.038
- You're the only family he's got.

806
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:50.560
You can help me.

807
00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:51.393
I made a deal.

808
00:59:51.393 --> 00:59:54.380
If you do it for
anybody. do it for Joey.

809
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:55.800
- I have to give up Lester

810
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:58.583
and I need you to testify against him.

811
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:03.383
- I can't let you do that.

812
01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.673
- Alex. listen to me.

813
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:12.070
If we don't. I never see you again.

814
01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:13.880
They have pictures. they have evidence.

815
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.043
they have everything.

816
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:17.533
It's over.

817
01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:22.499
- What have you been bringing them?

818
01:00:22.499 --> 01:00:23.332
In the brown bags?

819
01:00:23.332 --> 01:00:24.730
- So you have been fucking stalking me!

820
01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:25.920
- Lydia.

821
01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.133
- Loco. okay?

822
01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:30.500
I've been skimming the batches for weeks.

823
01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.850
- My batches.

824
01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:33.897
- They wanted it for testing or some shit.

825
01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:35.300
- He was like a father to you

826
01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.570
and he helped you through so much.

827
01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:39.120
- I did what I could to protect him.

828
01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.997
I gave him signals to leave
town. but then when Jason was--

829
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:50.283
I knew that I had to give the rest up.

830
01:00:52.312 --> 01:00:55.070
We had gone too far and they
know about the diner now. too.

831
01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:57.053
It's only a matter of fucking time!

832
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:03.063
We don't have to go down with him. Alex.

833
01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:08.037
You told me that you would help me

834
01:01:10.707 --> 01:01:12.433
and now I need you Alex.

835
01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:17.350
He's been using us the whole fucking time.

836
01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.017
- No. Lydia's not so stupid after all.

837
01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:23.950
You get a last name?

838
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:25.970
- It's Kane with a K. Kane.

839
01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.160
- Hey. run this for me.

840
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.683
Lydia Kane. K-A-N-E.

841
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.960
Yeah. I have a suspect telling
me she's an FBI informant

842
01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.550
working the Lester Skaggs case.

843
01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:50.900
Can you check if it's true?

844
01:01:52.644 --> 01:01:54.061
All right. great.

845
01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.790
I got my guys on it.

846
01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:03.140
If she's really on the
inside. I'll let you go.

847
01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.693
Meet me outside town.

848
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:22.023
Location to follow.

849
01:02:41.651 --> 01:02:43.020
- Are you out of your fucking mind!

850
01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:44.050
- We have to talk!

851
01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:45.603
Not here. out. out!

852
01:02:46.922 --> 01:02:48.193
- This better be fucking good!

853
01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.183
- She came by yesterday.

854
01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:03.910
She explained everything.

855
01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:06.763
- And?

856
01:03:08.152 --> 01:03:08.985
- Fuck!

857
01:03:10.379 --> 01:03:11.424
- Well. what'd she say?

858
01:03:11.424 --> 01:03:13.160
- I don't know what to do anymore. man.

859
01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.573
I don't know what do you expect--

860
01:03:14.573 --> 01:03:16.490
- Come on. fucking. Alex!

861
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:18.063
You're not telling me anything.

862
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.950
Fuck. I ain't got time for this shit.

863
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:24.500
- She made a deal with the FBI.

864
01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:27.643
You were right.

865
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:30.543
She flipped.

866
01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:37.553
They know about the lab. everything.

867
01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:40.593
You were dead on about her.

868
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:43.703
You happy?

869
01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.713
- No shit.

870
01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:53.620
- Listen. you got to go underground.

871
01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:54.780
It's not safe here. you have to--

872
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.833
- Leave me alone.

873
01:03:57.536 --> 01:03:58.530
- What?

874
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.160
- Lay low. wait for my instructions.

875
01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:00.993
- Instructions?

876
01:04:00.993 --> 01:04:01.826
Fucking tell you--

877
01:04:01.826 --> 01:04:03.140
- I said fucking

878
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:07.183
leave me alone.

879
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:13.760
- It's like that?

880
01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:24.103
- Just like that.

881
01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:47.927
- You all right?

882
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:51.703
- I'm good.

883
01:04:52.883 --> 01:04:53.833
- Did you bring it?

884
01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:58.603
- No.

885
01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:00.973
I mean. I looked everywhere.

886
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.780
I don't even know if he's
really bringing the notebook.

887
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:05.053
but he did say he'd talk.

888
01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.570
It's immunity for us both. yeah?

889
01:05:12.505 --> 01:05:13.423
That was your word.

890
01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.313
- Yeah. you're both doing the right thing.

891
01:05:29.097 --> 01:05:30.097
- Don't go anywhere.

892
01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:33.413
Delaney.

893
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:38.583
What?

894
01:05:41.556 --> 01:05:42.389
You sure?

895
01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.223
Okay thanks.

896
01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:57.173
That was the FBI.

897
01:06:00.582 --> 01:06:03.332
They have no record of any
Lydia Kane working for them.

898
01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.573
Congratulations. Alex.

899
01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.657
you just blatantly lied to the DEA.

900
01:06:11.657 --> 01:06:13.493
that's a federal offense.

901
01:06:15.362 --> 01:06:18.090
- Just add it to the list.

902
01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:19.940
- The next words out of your mouth

903
01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:22.180
better be a thorough
explanation of all this shit

904
01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.570
you lied to me about and
what you specifically

905
01:06:24.570 --> 01:06:25.523
meant to tell me.

906
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.090
- I'd like to speak to an attorney.

907
01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:34.090
- Well. 20 years minimum for
lying to a federal agent.

908
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:40.663
Obviously. the deal is off
because I can't trust you.

909
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:45.993
That's intent to distribute. the assault.

910
01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:48.920
you're looking at a lot of time. Alex.

911
01:06:51.556 --> 01:06:54.223
Now. I can still help you if you

912
01:06:56.057 --> 01:06:58.607
end this bullshit and give up Lester.

913
01:06:59.827 --> 01:07:01.993
- How do I know you're not lying to me?

914
01:07:05.477 --> 01:07:06.477
- You don't.

915
01:07:11.469 --> 01:07:13.663
Explain. no games.

916
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:30.143
- You have to promise you'll let me go.

917
01:07:32.055 --> 01:07:34.210
- It's like that now.

918
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:35.060
- Just like that.

919
01:07:37.381 --> 01:07:38.923
You want Lester. right?

920
01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:42.920
- I'm giving you a chance here. Alex.

921
01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:48.083
You lie to me again. you'll
end up just like your mom.

922
01:07:54.482 --> 01:07:56.633
- It's the longitude and
latitude of the location.

923
01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.710
There's no address to this place.

924
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:02.770
You'll find him there.

925
01:08:37.443 --> 01:08:38.943
- Get out of here.

926
01:08:41.057 --> 01:08:42.057
- That easy?

927
01:08:44.107 --> 01:08:45.684
- And I need your car.

928
01:08:45.684 --> 01:08:47.684
I'll find ya. I promise.

929
01:09:04.026 --> 01:09:04.943
- It's bad.

930
01:09:07.755 --> 01:09:09.190
- What the fuck you doing. arrest him!

931
01:09:09.190 --> 01:09:10.320
- You idiot!

932
01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.173
- Pretty boy. get in the car.

933
01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.633
Hurry up.

934
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:23.763
Drive.

935
01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:04.680
- DEA!

936
01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.063
Lay down your shovel. get
your hands in the air!

937
01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:09.803
Atta boy.

938
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:11.973
Oh. hello. old friend.

939
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.603
- Go fuck yourself.

940
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:17.403
You bring Alex?

941
01:10:18.283 --> 01:10:19.383
- Oh. very impressive.

942
01:10:20.890 --> 01:10:21.773
Why use the boy?

943
01:10:23.038 --> 01:10:24.960
You could have found me on your own.

944
01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.603
- 'Cause this was too much fun.

945
01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:32.373
- You forget. I bring friends.

946
01:10:33.407 --> 01:10:34.843
- Yeah. you always do it.

947
01:10:37.531 --> 01:10:40.313
- Well. if it isn't Mr. Loco. himself.

948
01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:42.950
- What the fuck?

949
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:45.270
- It's nice to finally meet you.

950
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:46.740
Especially after spending so much time

951
01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.570
sampling your fine ass product.

952
01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:52.083
- Very clever. try to
lure me out here. alone.

953
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:55.510
But I'm always two steps ahead.

954
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:57.347
And this little fucking bitch

955
01:10:58.928 --> 01:11:01.690
has been delivering us
Loco for fucking weeks.

956
01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:03.744
- It's not like your little
samples did shit for--

957
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:08.560
- Things are about to get complicated.

958
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.530
- Lester!

959
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:10.940
- Put your fucking gun down.

960
01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.420
- I'm not doing shit.

961
01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.545
- Put your fucking down or
I'm gonna fucking shoot you.

962
01:11:15.545 --> 01:11:16.410
What the fuck is this?

963
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.203
- What the the fuck is this?

964
01:11:18.203 --> 01:11:20.710
I've been working for him
since I fucking took out

965
01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.570
the distributor of Loco.

966
01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:24.850
That fucking punk got killed for spitting

967
01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:28.240
on my fucking long shoes and
somebody else needed to step in

968
01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.380
and make the fucking money!

969
01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.670
Whole town is fucking sick of you.

970
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:34.707
Now put the fucking gun down now!

971
01:11:44.359 --> 01:11:45.990
- After all the shit I did for you.

972
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:48.410
- Look. this is fucking business.

973
01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:49.960
Don't get all emotional on me.

974
01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.080
You give me what. 10% cent percent?

975
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.960
He gives me 30%.

976
01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.453
Excuse me. step up.

977
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:59.933
Look at me. look at me.

978
01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:01.993
Look at me!

979
01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.160
He's a good boss and you
were going to give him up

980
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:05.993
just like that?

981
01:12:05.993 --> 01:12:07.350
- Get the fuck off her!

982
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:09.763
- Get the fuck back.
pretty boy. step back!

983
01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:15.843
I been waiting
for this for a long time.

984
01:12:17.067 --> 01:12:19.740
- So what are you going to do. kill me?

985
01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:22.103
Finally get your little
payback. hey. princess?

986
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:28.330
- No. Talome. that would be too easy.

987
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:30.720
- Why won't you just let her die?

988
01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.630
Oh. you preoccupation
with your little fucking

989
01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:36.203
precious wonder drug.

990
01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.840
I was teaching you a lesson.

991
01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.550
Your call.

992
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:46.273
- She was my everything
and you took it all away

993
01:12:46.273 --> 01:12:51.273
and I thought to myself. what
could equal that pain. right?

994
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.470
So I stole your clients.

995
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.147
I bought your boys out from under you.

996
01:12:56.147 --> 01:12:58.733
but I saved the best thing for last.

997
01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:03.253
Say hello to your daddy. Alex.

998
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:11.510
- Very good. very.
very. very fucking good!

999
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:13.000
Yeah. good old Lester.

1000
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.770
That's the Lester I remember.

1001
01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:16.570
- Lester. you gotta tell
me what's going on. I--

1002
01:13:16.570 --> 01:13:18.570
- You think I give a fuck?

1003
01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:21.653
- No. I don't think
you'd give a fuck at all.

1004
01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.801
You don't even care about
your own flesh and blood.

1005
01:13:38.866 --> 01:13:41.699
Point the gun at your son's chest.

1006
01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:43.993
Now.

1007
01:13:46.752 --> 01:13:48.919
- Talome. this whole time.

1008
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:53.943
- Yeah. the shadow master. devil himself.

1009
01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:56.840
- If I kill this little fucking prick

1010
01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:00.503
how do I know you're not gonna kill me?

1011
01:14:01.647 --> 01:14:03.078
Lester. please.

1012
01:14:03.078 --> 01:14:03.920
- Shh.

1013
01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.753
You don't.

1014
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:08.480
I figure a drug lord knee deep in the DEA

1015
01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.163
that kills his own son. now whoa.

1016
01:14:11.087 --> 01:14:12.437
that's a pretty good story.

1017
01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:16.220
A great legacy. great Talome!

1018
01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.940
Completely erased.

1019
01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:22.583
Now aim the gun at your
fucking son's chest.

1020
01:14:32.158 --> 01:14:33.463
- Why don't you fucking shoot me?

1021
01:14:34.756 --> 01:14:35.806
You're not my father.

1022
01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:38.260
- Give you a mom a kiss. kid.

1023
01:14:40.998 --> 01:14:42.248
Lester. Lester!

1024
01:14:44.601 --> 01:14:45.851
- You kill him.

1025
01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:48.424
Five.

1026
01:14:48.424 --> 01:14:49.540
- You don't think I can fucking do it?

1027
01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:50.895
- Four.

1028
01:14:50.895 --> 01:14:52.228
- Lester please!

1029
01:14:59.302 --> 01:15:00.653
- You fucking scumbag!

1030
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:44.053
Put the gun down.

1031
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.393
It's just between him and me.

1032
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:01.350
- What now?

1033
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:03.370
We buried these bodies.

1034
01:16:03.370 --> 01:16:05.963
We get back to business as usual.

1035
01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.357
You in or out?

1036
01:16:17.134 --> 01:16:18.467
- We're leaving.

1037
01:16:20.504 --> 01:16:21.904
- I'm not going to stop you.

1038
01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:25.393
We never met. you understand?

1039
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.913
Don't hurt that girl. you hear me?

1040
01:17:09.587 --> 01:17:10.420
- Joey.

1041
01:17:55.434 --> 01:17:56.739
- Son of a--

1042
01:18:00.222 --> 01:18:02.185
and I pick out a bitch

1043
01:18:07.901 --> 01:18:10.127
flash them a bitch

1044
01:18:15.849 --> 01:18:17.927
I pick out a bitch
