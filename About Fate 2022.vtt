00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.873
Today's the day.

4
00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:24.757
Today's the day.

5
00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.121
What?
Don't look at me like that.

6
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.459
It could happen.

7
00:01:36.632 --> 00:01:38.502
-Good morning.

8
00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:51.285
Yes.

9
00:01:51.687 --> 00:01:52.747
Yes!

10
00:01:55.585 --> 00:01:57.290
I'll think about it.

11
00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:03.862
That's a proposal-worthy face.
Right?

12
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.530
Well. I'd marry you.

13
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.587
Hey. Teddy? Come on.

14
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.740
What? You lick your own butt.

15
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:50.975
I'm feeling much better.
thank you for asking.

16
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:07.459
Oh.

17
00:04:12.823 --> 00:04:14.090
<i>So. when do</i>
<i>we pick up the ring?</i>

18
00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.160
Morning. Mom.

19
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:16.495
You know. I already told you

20
00:04:16.563 --> 00:04:18.197
I'm gonna pick up the ring
on my lunch hour.

21
00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.198
So. you know. I actually
don't need any help.

22
00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:21.566
<i>-Yeah. I know.</i>
-Thanks.

23
00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:22.930
<i>But you know</i>
<i>how forgetful you are.</i>

24
00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:24.564
<i>And that cold medicine</i>
<i>makes you loopy.</i>

25
00:04:24.632 --> 00:04:26.338
Yeah. well. I don't know.

26
00:04:26.407 --> 00:04:27.500
I feel like
I'm not gonna forget

27
00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:28.940
my engagement ring.

28
00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.173
even with a cold.

29
00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:31.576
But I appreciate it.

30
00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:33.776
<i>And don't stop taking</i>
<i>that medicine.</i>

31
00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:35.608
<i>You know.</i>
<i>no woman wants to say yes</i>

32
00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.412
<i>to a crusty nose.</i>

33
00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:40.949
<i>You have to remember</i>
<i>you only have one day a year</i>

34
00:04:41.017 --> 00:04:42.985
<i>when you can propose</i>
<i>on December 30th.</i>

35
00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:45.786
<i>You know. three generations</i>
<i>of Reeds can't be wrong.</i>

36
00:04:45.855 --> 00:04:47.626
Yeah. I'm well aware.
No. I know.

37
00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:49.460
But I gotta go. okay?
But I'll talk to you later.

38
00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:51.531
<i>Oh. who'd have thought.</i>
<i>my son.</i>

39
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.862
<i>two times Student Samaritan</i>
<i>of the Month.</i>

40
00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:57.663
<i>engaged to a girl with</i>
<i>her own park bench? Like...</i>

41
00:04:57.732 --> 00:04:59.231
I know. I know.

42
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.372
All right. well. I love you.
okay? Gotta go. Bye.

43
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:02.604
<i>Oh. and just one more thing...</i>

44
00:05:02.672 --> 00:05:05.038
-Oh. shit!

45
00:05:06.448 --> 00:05:09.383
Dad proposed to you
after one week.

46
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:10.945
<i>Well. that was</i>
<i>a different time.</i>

47
00:05:11.013 --> 00:05:12.651
<i>And your dad</i>
<i>wanted to get laid.</i>

48
00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.847
<i>Oh. as a matter of fact.</i>
<i>he's on his way back now.</i>

49
00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:16.417
<i>We're in our hotel room. so...</i>

50
00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:18.050
Okay. TMI. Mom.

51
00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:20.653
Anyway. he made
dinner reservations

52
00:05:20.722 --> 00:05:22.690
and says he wants to talk.

53
00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:24.256
<i>Oh. I hope it's not cancer.</i>

54
00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:26.499
What if the first time
you're meeting my boyfriend.

55
00:05:26.568 --> 00:05:29.403
you're actually
meeting my fiancé?

56
00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:31.565
<i>Okay. we've been</i>
<i>down this road before</i>

57
00:05:31.634 --> 00:05:32.834
<i>and it never ends well.</i>

58
00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:34.304
<i>Look. you have a date</i>
<i>to the wedding.</i>

59
00:05:34.372 --> 00:05:35.673
<i>just take the win.</i>

60
00:05:35.742 --> 00:05:38.144
I wonder if it's too late
to get a spray tan.

61
00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:39.612
<i>Your sister will kill you</i>

62
00:05:39.681 --> 00:05:41.108
<i>if you have a tan</i>
<i>at her winter wedding.</i>

63
00:05:41.177 --> 00:05:44.651
Well. maybe I want to be
tanned for my winter proposal.

64
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.217
- <i> I will meet you</i>
<i>at the bridal shop at noon.</i>

65
00:05:46.286 --> 00:05:48.487
<i>Do not be late. Again.</i>

66
00:05:48.556 --> 00:05:50.116
<i>-Love you.</i>

67
00:05:52.092 --> 00:05:53.491
Morning. Doris.

68
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.255
-Double tall latte.

69
00:05:55.323 --> 00:05:58.524
You are the sweetest lawyer
in the entire building.

70
00:05:58.593 --> 00:05:59.829
Stop.

71
00:06:00.803 --> 00:06:01.897
Oh. Um...

72
00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:03.767
Yeah. it's actually
not what you think it is.

73
00:06:03.836 --> 00:06:05.836
Oh. well.
it looks like coffee.

74
00:06:05.905 --> 00:06:08.072
Well. then I guess it is
what you think it is. Doris.

75
00:06:08.141 --> 00:06:09.141
There we go.

76
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.471
-Hey. buddy.
-Hey!

77
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.305
Big night tonight.

78
00:06:12.841 --> 00:06:14.347
Yeah. you a little nervous?

79
00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:16.182
Well. clearly.
Oh. shit. Nice.

80
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.550
I get it. It's not every day

81
00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:20.051
you propose
to the hottest chick in town.

82
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.280
Oh.

83
00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:23.417
Okay. can you please not refer
to my future wife as a chick?

84
00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:24.688
Oh. sorry.

85
00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:27.060
-Empress. Duchess. Mistress.
-You know what? No.

86
00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:28.086
She's not like that. okay?

87
00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:29.661
Oh. yeah?
You use her Sonicare again?

88
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.530
No. I already told you.
that was my fault.

89
00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:32.827
-I should've asked.
-Listen. buddy.

90
00:06:32.895 --> 00:06:34.633
There is
an unspoken list of things

91
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:37.037
that couples in relationships
can share.

92
00:06:37.105 --> 00:06:39.071
Okay? You've got porn.

93
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.333
you've got razors.

94
00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:42.108
toothbrushes.

95
00:06:42.644 --> 00:06:44.344
-Mostly porn.
-Okay. I'm just gonna need you

96
00:06:44.413 --> 00:06:45.677
to stop worrying
about my girlfriend

97
00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:46.839
and just focus
on getting your own. okay?

98
00:06:46.908 --> 00:06:48.480
Hey. I'm working on it. man.

99
00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:51.810
"I am Sam" is up
on Hinge and Tinder.

100
00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:53.112
You know that's a movie

101
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:54.447
about the mentally
disabled guy. right?

102
00:06:54.883 --> 00:06:56.520
-Shit.
-Just saying.

103
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:58.285
I thought
I was low on matches.

104
00:07:01.394 --> 00:07:03.624
Oh. my God.

105
00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:05.428
You missed the best party.

106
00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:06.764
Totally should have come.

107
00:07:06.832 --> 00:07:08.294
Yeah. I wanted to.
but all you texted me

108
00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:10.598
was the side of a building
and the name "Paco."

109
00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:13.902
Paco! Oh. my God. So cute.

110
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:15.675
We should all
grab drinks at lunch.

111
00:07:15.743 --> 00:07:18.041
I can't. I have the stupid
final dress fitting.

112
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.478
My sister's worried I'm gonna
put on a late 10 pounds

113
00:07:20.547 --> 00:07:22.247
and ruin
her perfect aesthetic.

114
00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:23.516
Fine. After work. then.

115
00:07:23.585 --> 00:07:25.485
Stop pretending
like you don't know

116
00:07:25.554 --> 00:07:28.419
what's possibly
maybe happening tonight.

117
00:07:28.488 --> 00:07:29.985
Why are you getting engaged

118
00:07:30.053 --> 00:07:32.118
to a man who's hiding
from your friends?

119
00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:35.426
He's not hiding. He's earning
his third-degree black belt.

120
00:07:35.495 --> 00:07:37.124
I mean. that's time-consuming.

121
00:07:37.192 --> 00:07:39.592
And he's getting over
a really bad cold.

122
00:07:39.661 --> 00:07:41.133
For three months?

123
00:07:41.202 --> 00:07:42.800
Can you just support me?

124
00:07:42.868 --> 00:07:46.170
Okay? I think I have
finally found Mr. Right.

125
00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:48.071
I do support you.

126
00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:51.477
I just think Mr. Right is not
the guy that calls you

127
00:07:51.546 --> 00:07:53.378
while he's sitting
on your face.

128
00:07:53.447 --> 00:07:54.713
My face is on a park bench.

129
00:07:54.781 --> 00:07:56.077
You're supposed to sit on it
and call me.

130
00:07:56.146 --> 00:07:59.212
If they're shopping for homes.
not vagina.

131
00:07:59.748 --> 00:08:01.217
He said it was fate.

132
00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:02.582
-No!

133
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:03.990
It's advertising.

134
00:08:04.059 --> 00:08:05.323
Fate is magical.

135
00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:07.088
Fate is supernatural.

136
00:08:07.157 --> 00:08:10.196
Fate is meeting Calvin Harris
at Coachella.

137
00:08:10.264 --> 00:08:11.528
losing him in a crowd.

138
00:08:11.597 --> 00:08:13.326
then waking up in Joshua Tree

139
00:08:13.394 --> 00:08:16.933
to find him making s'mores
by an open campfire.

140
00:08:18.173 --> 00:08:19.538
Without his shirt on.

141
00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:22.142
-That was a fun weekend.

142
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:23.537
I have to work. Please.

143
00:08:23.606 --> 00:08:24.606
Oh. my God.

144
00:08:24.675 --> 00:08:25.971
Oh. my God.

145
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.278
Oh. my God. You're so boring.

146
00:08:27.347 --> 00:08:28.748
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

147
00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:30.480
- <i> And you're positive</i>
<i>he's coming.</i>

148
00:08:30.549 --> 00:08:32.515
- <i> Yes. he's coming.</i>

149
00:08:32.584 --> 00:08:34.279
Why do you keep asking me?

150
00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:35.853
- Because
no one's even met him.

151
00:08:35.922 --> 00:08:38.084
And you do have a history
of fake boyfriends.

152
00:08:38.153 --> 00:08:40.191
Okay. that was one time.

153
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.253
Kip is real.

154
00:08:41.322 --> 00:08:43.362
He's my date.
You're gonna love him.

155
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:45.499
-It's $40 a plate.
-So?

156
00:08:45.568 --> 00:08:46.829
-$40 a plate. It's just...
-Okay. so?

157
00:08:46.898 --> 00:08:48.061
We're not having
a rehearsal dinner.

158
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.903
so we can have
a really nice reception.

159
00:08:49.972 --> 00:08:51.969
And if he's not coming. then
we'll invite Brian's Auntie V.

160
00:08:52.038 --> 00:08:55.006
Oh. okay. Well. screw Auntie V
because he's coming.

161
00:08:55.074 --> 00:08:56.740
And if he doesn't. I'll be
sure to write you a check.

162
00:08:56.809 --> 00:08:57.972
- Well. you can
write it out to me.

163
00:08:58.041 --> 00:08:59.277
Who do you think
is paying for this thing?

164
00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:00.547
Isn't the groom's family

165
00:09:00.749 --> 00:09:02.043
traditionally supposed to pay
for that part?

166
00:09:02.112 --> 00:09:03.645
-Mm...
-Okay. sorry. are you calling

167
00:09:03.713 --> 00:09:04.847
Brian's family cheap?

168
00:09:04.916 --> 00:09:06.180
No. they happen
to be taking us

169
00:09:06.348 --> 00:09:08.086
to a really fancy brunch
the day after the wedding.

170
00:09:08.855 --> 00:09:10.218
Are we almost done here?
Because I don't want

171
00:09:10.286 --> 00:09:11.588
to be late for my spray tan
appointment. so...

172
00:09:11.657 --> 00:09:12.985
No. no. Mom? See. I told you.

173
00:09:13.054 --> 00:09:14.219
She's gonna ruin the wedding.

174
00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:16.460
Okay. how is
me getting a spray tan

175
00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:17.829
gonna ruin the wedding?

176
00:09:17.898 --> 00:09:19.565
I don't know.
You'll turn yourself orange

177
00:09:19.633 --> 00:09:21.565
or you'll get UV-poisoning
and die.

178
00:09:21.634 --> 00:09:22.733
You will figure out some way

179
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:25.135
to make my wedding
all about...

180
00:09:25.204 --> 00:09:26.266
you.

181
00:09:27.939 --> 00:09:29.805
-Prom?
-Still haven't let that go?

182
00:09:29.873 --> 00:09:31.005
-Yeah.
-It's not my fault

183
00:09:31.174 --> 00:09:32.712
that Dylan Kidd
liked me better than you.

184
00:09:32.781 --> 00:09:34.109
Well. you're the one
who gave him a blow job

185
00:09:34.178 --> 00:09:35.915
in the guest bathroom.
So. it is your fault.

186
00:09:35.984 --> 00:09:37.882
Yeah. well. that's because
you take forever to get ready.

187
00:09:38.317 --> 00:09:39.719
- Mom?

188
00:09:40.255 --> 00:09:41.480
It is true. you do.

189
00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:43.586
I knew it. I knew I should've
asked Gloria Hefner

190
00:09:43.655 --> 00:09:44.654
to be my maid of honor.

191
00:09:44.723 --> 00:09:46.219
Gloria Hefner has one eyebrow.

192
00:09:46.288 --> 00:09:48.055
How fast can you make
another dress?

193
00:09:48.124 --> 00:09:50.059
No. no. no.
She's out of the wedding!

194
00:09:50.128 --> 00:09:51.696
-Out. out. yes! Yeah.
-Promise? Swear? Promise?

195
00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:55.168
Okay. girls. girls. girls!
Enough.

196
00:09:55.236 --> 00:09:56.296
You're sisters.

197
00:09:56.364 --> 00:09:59.201
So. that means. by law.
you are bound to pretend

198
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.034
to love each other and
be in each other's weddings.

199
00:10:02.103 --> 00:10:04.042
That's just how it goes. Okay?

200
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:09.078
So. why don't you two say
something nice to each other?

201
00:10:10.716 --> 00:10:12.411
Nothing comes to mind. so...

202
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.615
- Here you go. sir.
Sized and shined.

203
00:10:14.684 --> 00:10:16.552
Oh. my God.

204
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:17.986
Oh. honey. no. no.

205
00:10:18.055 --> 00:10:20.022
Mom.
what are you doing here?

206
00:10:20.091 --> 00:10:21.387
I told you.
I don't any help today.

207
00:10:21.456 --> 00:10:22.955
- Well. from the looks
of this box. you do.

208
00:10:23.024 --> 00:10:24.291
What's wrong with the box?

209
00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:26.830
Well. it's just dull.
I mean. it doesn't sing to me.

210
00:10:26.898 --> 00:10:28.997
Do you have these
in another color

211
00:10:29.066 --> 00:10:31.235
like gold. or glitter.
or faux fur?

212
00:10:31.304 --> 00:10:34.240
Yeah. apparently we're looking
for the Beyoncé of ring boxes.

213
00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:35.368
We just have these.

214
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.311
My only son is getting engaged
for the very first time in...

215
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.504
I mean. you can understand

216
00:10:39.573 --> 00:10:41.777
how I just want
this proposal to be perfect.

217
00:10:41.846 --> 00:10:43.178
And it will be perfect. okay?

218
00:10:43.247 --> 00:10:44.784
So. you don't really
have to worry about it.

219
00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:48.282
Uh-huh. So. maybe.
I could hear it first?

220
00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:50.883
-Hear what?
-Your proposal speech.

221
00:10:50.952 --> 00:10:52.357
Oh. no. No. no. no.

222
00:10:52.426 --> 00:10:53.658
Absolutely not. No.

223
00:10:53.726 --> 00:10:55.158
Just try it out.
Just for safety.

224
00:10:55.227 --> 00:10:57.993
No. I'm not proposing
to my mother. That's crazy.

225
00:10:58.061 --> 00:11:00.866
Okay. Suit yourself.

226
00:11:01.935 --> 00:11:03.402
-Sorry. this is...
-It's a nice box.

227
00:11:03.471 --> 00:11:04.738
It's a really nice box.

228
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.673
Well. it's only the
single-most important thing

229
00:11:06.742 --> 00:11:09.535
you'll ever say
to a woman. but. uh.

230
00:11:10.238 --> 00:11:12.144
you'll be fine
just winging it.

231
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.247
Okay. You know what? One time.

232
00:11:14.316 --> 00:11:15.441
But you say nothing.

233
00:11:16.448 --> 00:11:17.949
All right.

234
00:11:24.658 --> 00:11:25.821
-Babe?

235
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.385
Ever since I saw your face.

236
00:11:27.454 --> 00:11:30.525
staring up at me
from that park bench.

237
00:11:31.228 --> 00:11:33.165
I knew that you were
the one for me.

238
00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:36.735
Your beauty. your drive.
your energy...

239
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.531
I mean. I never thought
that some guy like me

240
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.567
would end up with
an incredible woman like you.

241
00:11:43.036 --> 00:11:45.442
You inspire me.

242
00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:46.679
You challenge me.

243
00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:48.212
You push me
out of my comfort zone

244
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.515
because I know you just
want me to be a better man.

245
00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:53.813
And because of you. I am.

246
00:11:55.257 --> 00:11:56.352
Clementine.

247
00:11:57.122 --> 00:11:59.358
will you please
do me the great honor

248
00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:00.385
of becoming my wife?

249
00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:02.827
Oh! Honey. of course. I will.

250
00:12:02.896 --> 00:12:04.859
-- Aw.
-All right.

251
00:12:04.928 --> 00:12:06.261
That's that. All right.

252
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.798
-Oh! Oh. God!
-No. it's not cool. Just...

253
00:12:08.867 --> 00:12:10.603
I'll take these.

254
00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:19.345
Wow!

255
00:12:19.414 --> 00:12:21.408
You look stunning.

256
00:12:21.477 --> 00:12:23.914
You look
quite dapper yourself.

257
00:12:23.983 --> 00:12:25.213
I'm so glad
you're feeling better.

258
00:12:25.382 --> 00:12:26.747
Oh. well. I'm still taking
the cold medicine.

259
00:12:26.816 --> 00:12:28.085
just to be safe.

260
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.019
<i>Yeah. I know this place is</i>
<i>kind of a surprise. but. um.</i>

261
00:12:31.088 --> 00:12:32.722
you know.
it's sentimental for me.

262
00:12:32.791 --> 00:12:33.924
My family actually does

263
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.054
their New Year's day brunch
here. every year.

264
00:12:35.123 --> 00:12:36.863
I think Bennigan's is fun.

265
00:12:36.932 --> 00:12:38.390
I mean. the cocktails
are super creative.

266
00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:40.962
Ooh. yeah.
should we order drinks?

267
00:12:41.031 --> 00:12:42.330
Peach on the Beach looks good.

268
00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:44.468
Oh. my God. Peach on the Beach
is the best.

269
00:12:46.105 --> 00:12:49.173
I am so excited
for tomorrow.

270
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:51.204
I mean. I can't wait for you
to meet my family.

271
00:12:51.373 --> 00:12:52.978
<i>Uh. the wedding starts</i>
<i>at- 00.</i>

272
00:12:53.046 --> 00:12:55.245
Yeah. yeah. So. I'm just
gonna go into the city.

273
00:12:55.314 --> 00:12:57.417
meet the guys. and then.
I should have plenty of time

274
00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:58.610
to come back. shower.

275
00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:00.887
And then. uh. I'll be
at your place by- 00?

276
00:13:00.956 --> 00:13:02.251
I picked up your tux
from the dry cleaner.

277
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.815
so you can just get ready
at mine.

278
00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:05.254
Perfect.

279
00:13:08.122 --> 00:13:09.523
You know. it's funny.

280
00:13:09.592 --> 00:13:12.032
even though we haven't
been together that long...

281
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.567
I know. I can't believe
it's only been three months.

282
00:13:14.636 --> 00:13:15.767
Feels like forever.

283
00:13:15.836 --> 00:13:16.898
You know.
it's funny. my parents

284
00:13:16.967 --> 00:13:18.532
actually have this saying.

285
00:13:19.101 --> 00:13:22.101
"When you know. you know."

286
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.708
"When you know. you know."

287
00:13:23.777 --> 00:13:24.942
Believe it or not. they. uh...

288
00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:28.046
they actually got engaged
at a Bennigan's.

289
00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:33.019
Welcome to Bennigan's.

290
00:13:33.388 --> 00:13:34.683
OMG.

291
00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:35.987
I know you.

292
00:13:36.056 --> 00:13:37.988
You're
the Fletcher's Mattress girl.

293
00:13:38.056 --> 00:13:39.518
You're even prettier
in person.

294
00:13:39.587 --> 00:13:41.390
Thank you. that's so sweet.

295
00:13:41.459 --> 00:13:43.894
You know. she's also
the Muffinland Bakery Queen.

296
00:13:43.963 --> 00:13:45.564
Um. could I get a selfie?

297
00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:46.697
- <i> Is this a joke?</i>

298
00:13:46.766 --> 00:13:48.095
I think it's for the best.

299
00:13:48.164 --> 00:13:49.494
You think it's best to dump me

300
00:13:49.563 --> 00:13:51.100
the night before
my sister's wedding?

301
00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:52.966
We have had
a beautiful adventure

302
00:13:53.035 --> 00:13:54.202
the last few months.

303
00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:56.336
But before
things get complicated.

304
00:13:56.404 --> 00:13:58.072
you know.
with meeting the family

305
00:13:58.141 --> 00:14:00.039
and seating assignments and...

306
00:14:00.308 --> 00:14:01.748
Uh. I don't want to be a dick.

307
00:14:01.817 --> 00:14:03.047
Oh. you don't want
to be a dick?

308
00:14:03.216 --> 00:14:05.214
Well. that's exactly
what you're being. Kip.

309
00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:06.914
-You're being a dick.
-Whoa.

310
00:14:06.982 --> 00:14:08.351
Okay. Um. look.

311
00:14:08.419 --> 00:14:11.051
I know that my assistant
messed up the reservation.

312
00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:12.791
La Boucherie. Bennigan's.

313
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.561
We can still have
a nice dinner.

314
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.894
even though it's not French.

315
00:14:15.963 --> 00:14:17.293
No. we can't have
a nice dinner. Kip.

316
00:14:17.362 --> 00:14:20.164
Okay? And what. did you think
it would be nicer

317
00:14:20.233 --> 00:14:23.228
to dump me over truffle fries
and escargot?

318
00:14:23.297 --> 00:14:25.296
- One. two. three. Hey.

319
00:14:25.499 --> 00:14:26.938
-There you go.
-Oh. my God!

320
00:14:27.007 --> 00:14:28.740
-Thank you!
-Yeah. of course.

321
00:14:28.809 --> 00:14:30.007
I'm literally going to die.

322
00:14:30.076 --> 00:14:32.176
Oh. no! Maybe we can get
our drinks first?

323
00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:34.978
You're funny.

324
00:14:35.047 --> 00:14:36.642
-He's funny.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

325
00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:39.211
Are you. um... Are you
her manager or something?

326
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.017
Griffin is actually
a brilliant lawyer.

327
00:14:43.352 --> 00:14:45.992
He's about to join
my uncle's firm.

328
00:14:47.692 --> 00:14:48.828
I am?

329
00:14:48.897 --> 00:14:50.094
One of the partners
is leaving.

330
00:14:50.363 --> 00:14:51.924
- <i> Margot. I meditated</i>
<i>on this last night.</i>

331
00:14:51.993 --> 00:14:55.293
And it came to me in a dream
the timing is just not right.

332
00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:56.830
But maybe in another life.

333
00:14:57.132 --> 00:14:58.631
In another life. what?

334
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:00.598
-Reincarnation.
-Oh!

335
00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:02.435
-Yes. it's another chance...

336
00:15:02.504 --> 00:15:03.871
-Okay.
-...and that is on the way

337
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.242
to nirvana.

338
00:15:05.311 --> 00:15:07.746
Wow. well. thank you so much.
Kurt Cobain.

339
00:15:07.815 --> 00:15:09.277
That's not the right Nirvana.

340
00:15:09.346 --> 00:15:10.576
And that's what
I'm talking about.

341
00:15:10.645 --> 00:15:12.314
-It's just. something's not...

342
00:15:12.383 --> 00:15:14.087
What're you doing?
You're overreacting.

343
00:15:14.156 --> 00:15:15.920
-Come on. sit down.
-You think I'm overreacting?

344
00:15:15.989 --> 00:15:18.321
Okay.
this is not overreacting.

345
00:15:18.991 --> 00:15:20.622
This would be overreacting!

346
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.330
Peach on the Beach.
What do they put in that?

347
00:15:24.532 --> 00:15:25.565
What is going on?

348
00:15:25.634 --> 00:15:26.558
It's been three months.

349
00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:28.628
What were you expecting?
A proposal?

350
00:15:30.669 --> 00:15:31.972
I mean...

351
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.308
No.

352
00:15:35.377 --> 00:15:36.607
Oh...

353
00:15:36.676 --> 00:15:38.672
shit. Okay. Um...

354
00:15:38.975 --> 00:15:40.244
This is awkward.

355
00:15:40.813 --> 00:15:43.049
Okay.

356
00:15:45.817 --> 00:15:46.913
Margot. wait.

357
00:15:46.982 --> 00:15:48.615
Yeah?

358
00:15:50.922 --> 00:15:52.118
I am gonna need the tux.

359
00:15:52.186 --> 00:15:53.656
Do not call me.

360
00:15:53.725 --> 00:15:54.757
Ever.

361
00:15:54.826 --> 00:15:56.224
Ever. ever.

362
00:15:56.293 --> 00:15:57.322
-Again.

363
00:15:57.391 --> 00:15:58.891
- All right.

364
00:16:01.134 --> 00:16:03.334
Oh. my God.
that was so embarrassing.

365
00:16:04.304 --> 00:16:06.566
Babe? From the moment
that I saw your face

366
00:16:06.635 --> 00:16:08.367
looking up at me
from that park bench...

367
00:16:08.436 --> 00:16:09.834
Oh. my God. are you proposing?

368
00:16:10.137 --> 00:16:11.170
Um...

369
00:16:11.239 --> 00:16:12.371
-Yes.
-Yes!

370
00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.605
-Yes?
-Yes! Oh. my God!

371
00:16:13.674 --> 00:16:15.213
-Yes? Oh. my God.
-Yes. I'm so happy!

372
00:16:15.282 --> 00:16:17.181
Oh. my God. I love you
so much. Yes. of course.

373
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.378
Now. can you please sit down?
Sit down.

374
00:16:18.447 --> 00:16:19.611
You don't want
to see the ring?

375
00:16:19.914 --> 00:16:21.417
Oh. I'm sure it's beautiful.
I'm sure it's beautiful.

376
00:16:21.486 --> 00:16:24.857
Just. um. save it
for the real proposal. Okay?

377
00:16:24.925 --> 00:16:26.290
-The real proposal?
-Mm-hmm.

378
00:16:26.359 --> 00:16:28.120
Tomorrow night
at our New Year's Eve party.

379
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:29.321
It'll be perfect.

380
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:30.556
But. this is perfect.

381
00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:32.798
Tonight. You know.
it's December 30th.

382
00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:34.128
It's a Reed family tradition.

383
00:16:34.197 --> 00:16:35.797
I love your traditions.

384
00:16:35.866 --> 00:16:37.002
I just...

385
00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:39.936
We are technically engaged.
Yay.

386
00:16:40.105 --> 00:16:41.270
Just do it again like that.

387
00:16:41.339 --> 00:16:43.804
Tomorrow.
And I will say yes. again.

388
00:16:43.872 --> 00:16:45.842
I... I don't want to do it
again tomorrow. you know?

389
00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:47.207
I just... I just did it.

390
00:16:47.276 --> 00:16:49.209
Here. now. I mean. almost.

391
00:16:49.277 --> 00:16:50.444
Griffin. I...

392
00:16:50.513 --> 00:16:51.643
I just don't see
what the big deal is.

393
00:16:51.712 --> 00:16:53.680
Like. you just got
your proposal.

394
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:55.614
And then. me and my followers
can get mine.

395
00:16:55.683 --> 00:16:58.652
Well. I guess
the big deal is that

396
00:16:58.721 --> 00:17:01.958
I don't want our proposal
to be some photo op

397
00:17:02.026 --> 00:17:03.254
for your social media.

398
00:17:03.323 --> 00:17:04.630
It's about us.

399
00:17:04.699 --> 00:17:06.663
It will be about us.

400
00:17:06.732 --> 00:17:10.763
But I have a responsibility
to my public and my sponsors.

401
00:17:10.832 --> 00:17:13.201
Griffin. you know
I'm a professional influencer.

402
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.106
which means that I get paid

403
00:17:15.175 --> 00:17:17.169
when I influence
other people's lives.

404
00:17:17.238 --> 00:17:19.743
Like. what I wear

405
00:17:19.812 --> 00:17:21.411
and what I eat

406
00:17:22.145 --> 00:17:23.843
and where I get engaged.

407
00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:26.448
There is no chance in hell
that I'm going to waste

408
00:17:26.517 --> 00:17:29.188
a once-in-a-lifetime
golden opportunity

409
00:17:29.257 --> 00:17:33.159
for Death by Chocolate
and Turkey O'Tooles. no.

410
00:17:33.227 --> 00:17:34.689
Wait. wait. come on.
You're gonna leave?

411
00:17:34.758 --> 00:17:37.289
-We just got engaged.
-Whoa. No. no. We did not.

412
00:17:37.358 --> 00:17:40.133
I am taking back my yes.

413
00:17:42.264 --> 00:17:44.698
-Hey!
-No. no.

414
00:17:48.469 --> 00:17:50.704
-Oh. great.

415
00:17:51.474 --> 00:17:52.739
-Thank you so much.
-What?

416
00:17:52.807 --> 00:17:54.245
-Thank you.
-- I don't work here.

417
00:17:54.314 --> 00:17:55.577
-Take me to Maple. please.
-No. no. no!

418
00:17:55.645 --> 00:17:56.516
-Can't hear you. sorry.
-- Great.

419
00:17:56.585 --> 00:17:57.748
Just great.

420
00:17:57.983 --> 00:17:59.746
This is...

421
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.448
Ugh. Come on.

422
00:18:02.817 --> 00:18:04.956
-Um. did you see...?
-Are you looking for

423
00:18:05.025 --> 00:18:07.625
a tall. redhead. super rude?

424
00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:09.391
-Yeah.
-Yeah. I saw her.

425
00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.897
She actually just left
in my Uber.

426
00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.331
Oh. here. she gave me this.

427
00:18:13.399 --> 00:18:16.662
Oh. Thanks.
Yeah. sorry. she was upset.

428
00:18:16.731 --> 00:18:19.403
Great job. Bennigan's.
Great job.

429
00:18:20.841 --> 00:18:22.308
Uh. do you need help?

430
00:18:22.544 --> 00:18:23.705
Uh...

431
00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:26.107
Not unless you got
an engagement ring

432
00:18:26.175 --> 00:18:27.477
in your pocket.

433
00:18:28.044 --> 00:18:29.112
Uh...

434
00:18:29.381 --> 00:18:31.217
This is me.

435
00:19:03.543 --> 00:19:04.677
Good morning. Judy.

436
00:19:05.146 --> 00:19:06.814
- <i> It's almost noon.</i>
<i>Your sister's losing her mind.</i>

437
00:19:06.883 --> 00:19:08.618
<i>The wedding planner</i>
<i>is stuck in Vermont</i>

438
00:19:08.687 --> 00:19:10.619
<i>and the bridal shop</i>
<i>forgot to pack the veil.</i>

439
00:19:10.688 --> 00:19:12.484
<i>And the maid of honor</i>
<i>is still in bed.</i>

440
00:19:12.552 --> 00:19:13.786
I'm not still in bed.

441
00:19:13.855 --> 00:19:15.724
<i>Christ. he didn't propose.</i>
<i>did he?</i>

442
00:19:15.793 --> 00:19:17.689
<i>You got your hopes up</i>
<i>and you were wrong.</i>

443
00:19:17.758 --> 00:19:19.295
<i>and now you're falling apart.</i>

444
00:19:19.364 --> 00:19:21.098
I'm not falling apart.
No. Mom.

445
00:19:21.167 --> 00:19:24.734
I am not feeling well. At all.

446
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.532
I don't think I should go
to the wedding.

447
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.868
I could be contagious.

448
00:19:28.936 --> 00:19:31.076
<i>So. this Kip</i>
<i>is still your plus one?</i>

449
00:19:31.145 --> 00:19:32.543
-Yes.
-<i> All right. then.</i>

450
00:19:32.612 --> 00:19:34.039
<i>You need to shower yourself</i>
<i>in Benadryl.</i>

451
00:19:34.108 --> 00:19:35.975
<i>ice your puffy face</i>
<i>and get your butt down</i>

452
00:19:36.044 --> 00:19:38.410
<i>to the hotel to help</i>
<i>your sister get married.</i>

453
00:19:38.479 --> 00:19:40.613
Okay. I'll de-puff.

454
00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:42.117
<i>And you'll pick up the veil.</i>

455
00:19:42.186 --> 00:19:43.482
Yes. I'll pick up...

456
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.918
We will pick up the veil.

457
00:19:49.764 --> 00:19:51.363
I'm in hell.

458
00:20:04.575 --> 00:20:06.443
-Surprise!
-Jesus Christ!

459
00:20:06.512 --> 00:20:08.507
I got Zara to loan us
an amazing suit

460
00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:09.776
for the party tonight.

461
00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:13.319
Sorry. am I missing
something here?

462
00:20:14.655 --> 00:20:15.820
Yes.

463
00:20:15.889 --> 00:20:18.555
Me. apologizing.

464
00:20:19.492 --> 00:20:22.460
Look. I'm really sorry
about last night.

465
00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:26.028
If you still want my "yes."
it's all yours.

466
00:20:27.429 --> 00:20:28.596
Yeah. you know what.

467
00:20:28.665 --> 00:20:30.328
I'm really sorry too. okay?
I just...

468
00:20:30.397 --> 00:20:33.500
All I want is for you to have
the proposal of your dreams.

469
00:20:33.569 --> 00:20:35.206
Okay? And so. if that means

470
00:20:35.274 --> 00:20:37.070
that we monetize
the engagement.

471
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.475
then. yeah. let's...
let's do it.

472
00:20:39.544 --> 00:20:41.974
-I support you.
-Oh. thank you.

473
00:20:48.021 --> 00:20:49.217
Oh. that... That...

474
00:20:49.286 --> 00:20:50.821
That looks so good.

475
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:52.725
Uh. you're acting strange.

476
00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:53.619
Are you okay?

477
00:20:53.688 --> 00:20:55.792
Oh. Yes. Sorry. I'm just...

478
00:20:55.861 --> 00:20:58.727
I overslept and I'm gonna be
late to meet the guys. so...

479
00:20:58.796 --> 00:21:01.230
I just don't really see
why you have to go.

480
00:21:01.298 --> 00:21:02.532
Oh. Yeah. No. I know.

481
00:21:02.801 --> 00:21:04.202
But it's just like our
tradition since law school.

482
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:05.467
You know.
Sam's family is Russian.

483
00:21:05.536 --> 00:21:07.069
They just love
bathhouses. so...

484
00:21:07.138 --> 00:21:08.273
Yeah.

485
00:21:08.509 --> 00:21:11.075
And you know that
I love traditions. but. uh.

486
00:21:11.143 --> 00:21:12.944
traditions can change.

487
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.014
I have to pee.
Try on the suit.

488
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.117
Hey. babe. two drink maximum
tonight. Okay?

489
00:21:18.186 --> 00:21:19.515
Remember.
vodka is not your friend.

490
00:21:19.584 --> 00:21:20.979
Vodka's not my friend.
You got it.

491
00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:22.848
Hey. how about
I just try this on later.

492
00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:24.352
And then.
you could be surprised. Huh?

493
00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:26.557
Did you use my toothbrush?

494
00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:28.386
Uh. no. why?

495
00:21:28.455 --> 00:21:29.657
It's wet.

496
00:21:29.725 --> 00:21:31.123
Oh. well. I mean.
I took a shower.

497
00:21:31.192 --> 00:21:32.827
So. I probably just splashed
on it or something.

498
00:21:32.895 --> 00:21:35.564
Hmm. I leave it here
because I trust you.

499
00:21:35.633 --> 00:21:38.229
And relationships
are built on trust.

500
00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:40.403
Uh. don't you think
it's weird that you kiss me.

501
00:21:40.471 --> 00:21:41.805
but I can't use
your toothbrush?

502
00:21:41.874 --> 00:21:42.902
No.

503
00:21:42.971 --> 00:21:45.002
Some things
aren't meant to be shared.

504
00:21:45.071 --> 00:21:47.778
-Oral hygiene is one of them.
-Oh.

505
00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:51.476
<i>Davai. davai!</i>

506
00:21:51.544 --> 00:21:52.680
<i>Davai!</i>

507
00:21:54.455 --> 00:21:56.253
She said "yes"?
And then she said "no"?

508
00:21:56.322 --> 00:21:59.552
Yes. But it's a yes. I think.

509
00:21:59.621 --> 00:22:00.853
Maybe she changed her mind

510
00:22:00.922 --> 00:22:04.030
about marrying
a lowly public defender.

511
00:22:04.099 --> 00:22:06.225
No. wrong. She supports me.

512
00:22:06.293 --> 00:22:08.962
She just thinks I should make
a move into corporate.

513
00:22:09.663 --> 00:22:11.096
You hate corporate.

514
00:22:12.106 --> 00:22:13.237
I don't hate corporate.

515
00:22:13.306 --> 00:22:14.370
Are you leaving the office?

516
00:22:14.439 --> 00:22:16.240
No. I mean. it's just a maybe.

517
00:22:16.309 --> 00:22:17.706
Clementine's uncle has a firm.

518
00:22:17.775 --> 00:22:19.276
So. she just wants
me to consider it.

519
00:22:19.345 --> 00:22:21.346
Hey. buddy. What do you want?

520
00:22:21.415 --> 00:22:22.907
Listen. I'm getting
what I want. okay?

521
00:22:22.976 --> 00:22:24.415
I'm getting...

Tonight. I'm making it
official. again.

523
00:22:26.716 --> 00:22:28.146
-You're getting married?
-Yeah.

00:22:29.951 --> 00:22:31.684
- Yes.

525
00:22:31.753 --> 00:22:33.724
- Oh. no. no. no. No.

526
00:22:33.792 --> 00:22:35.723
I told Clementine I'm not
gonna drink today. so...

527
00:22:35.792 --> 00:22:38.227
<i>Nyet!</i> Nonsense.

528
00:22:38.296 --> 00:22:39.363
Up. up. up. up. up.

00:22:39.432 --> 00:22:41.499
You will get married.
We toast.

530
00:22:41.568 --> 00:22:43.128
This is the best vodka
in the world.

531
00:22:43.196 --> 00:22:45.568
My grandmother had this
at her wedding.

532
00:22:45.637 --> 00:22:47.433
You cannot insult
his<i> babushka.</i>

533
00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:50.140
Okay. I'm not gonna insult
anyone's<i> babushka.</i> One shot.

534
00:22:50.208 --> 00:22:51.471
- <i> Na zdorovie!</i>

535
00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.674
- Oh. no. no. no.

536
00:22:52.843 --> 00:22:54.278
Oh. oh. oh. oh.
All the way. All the way.

537
00:22:54.347 --> 00:22:55.715
-Smell. smell.

538
00:22:55.784 --> 00:22:56.576
Right.

539
00:22:58.678 --> 00:23:00.415
One more cheer.

540
00:23:00.483 --> 00:23:02.955
The beautiful Clementine!

541
00:23:09.326 --> 00:23:10.761
Ooh.

542
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:14.130
- <i> Oh. my darling</i>
<i>Oh. my darling</i>

543
00:23:14.199 --> 00:23:16.164
<i>Clementina</i>

544
00:23:16.233 --> 00:23:17.369
Whoo-hoo!

545
00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:19.564
<i>-Clementina</i>

546
00:23:19.633 --> 00:23:21.705
<i>Clementina</i>

547
00:23:22.207 --> 00:23:24.605
<i>Clementina</i>

548
00:23:24.674 --> 00:23:26.406
<i>Clementina</i>

549
00:23:29.983 --> 00:23:31.213
Last one.

550
00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:34.982
-Whoo-hoo!
-Let's go!

551
00:23:45.027 --> 00:23:48.463

553
00:23:55.538 --> 00:23:56.602
- Thank you.

554
00:23:56.971 --> 00:23:58.938
I have to say
a proper goodbye.

555
00:23:59.007 --> 00:24:00.607
-Hey. put yourself...

556
00:24:00.675 --> 00:24:01.979
Hey. what's your name?

557
00:24:02.048 --> 00:24:03.115
Gevorg.

558
00:24:03.184 --> 00:24:04.278
Ah. that's my aunt's name.

559
00:24:09.151 --> 00:24:11.489
Okay. I love you too. Gevorg.

560
00:24:11.558 --> 00:24:14.025
Deliver her to 15 Maple Drive.
Norwood.

561
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:17.925
15 Maple...

562
00:24:17.994 --> 00:24:20.263
-Go get her. my friend.

563
00:24:20.332 --> 00:24:21.633
<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

564
00:24:21.702 --> 00:24:23.529
-Yep.
-- <i> Do svidaniya.</i>

565
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.576
- <i> Do svidaniya.</i>

566
00:24:31.741 --> 00:24:32.937
Who pissed in your Cheerios?

567
00:24:33.006 --> 00:24:34.442
Maybe I should just call him.

568
00:24:34.511 --> 00:24:35.779
The guy just dumped you.

569
00:24:35.847 --> 00:24:38.410
He doesn't get a call.
He gets a beating.

570
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.681
I'm sorry. you're not allowed
to have alcohol in here.

571
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.182
What about a broken heart?

572
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:45.089
Is she allowed to have
one of those in here?

573
00:24:45.158 --> 00:24:46.117
We're sorry.

574
00:24:46.186 --> 00:24:47.593
I thought this was
a place of healing.

575
00:24:48.496 --> 00:24:50.429
Look. seriously.
what am I going to do?

576
00:24:50.498 --> 00:24:51.792
I can't show up
without a date.

577
00:24:51.861 --> 00:24:54.193
How about him?
He seems fun.

578
00:24:55.228 --> 00:24:57.031
What?
The wedding's in four hours.

579
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.067
-You can't afford to be picky.
-Forget it.

580
00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:00.803
I can't just pick up
some random guy off the street

581
00:25:00.872 --> 00:25:02.238
and bring him
to my sister's wedding.

582
00:25:02.307 --> 00:25:03.534
Sure. you can.

583
00:25:03.603 --> 00:25:04.841
Hey.

584
00:25:07.348 --> 00:25:09.244
Want to go to a wedding later?

585
00:25:09.313 --> 00:25:10.550
Uh...

586
00:25:15.884 --> 00:25:19.122
Uh. I have plans. Or I would.

587
00:25:19.424 --> 00:25:20.857
Of course. you would.

588
00:25:22.626 --> 00:25:24.296
- This is so stupid.

589
00:25:24.365 --> 00:25:25.764
I mean. what kind of a loser

590
00:25:25.833 --> 00:25:27.459
doesn't already have a date
for New Year's Eve?

591
00:25:27.762 --> 00:25:29.195
Don't answer that.

592
00:25:29.596 --> 00:25:30.666
Got him.

593
00:25:30.735 --> 00:25:33.870
He's free tonight
and he's cute.

594
00:25:34.436 --> 00:25:35.806
Perfect.

595
00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.625
- 15 Maple Drive?

596
00:25:56.694 --> 00:25:58.296
That's right. 15 Maple Drive.

597
00:25:58.365 --> 00:25:59.459
15 Maple Drive.

598
00:25:59.528 --> 00:26:01.733
$96.15

599
00:26:02.863 --> 00:26:05.968
Wait. Maybe $46.15.

600
00:26:06.037 --> 00:26:09.503
But it's fine.
'Cause it's New Year's Eve.

601
00:26:09.872 --> 00:26:11.637
You're supposed to get a tip.

602
00:26:11.706 --> 00:26:13.540
You robbed me.

603
00:26:13.609 --> 00:26:14.611
You robbed me.

604
00:26:14.679 --> 00:26:16.242
Okay. my friend.
Happy New Year.

605
00:26:19.354 --> 00:26:21.214
- Oh. shit. Oh. God.

606
00:26:26.655 --> 00:26:28.654
Come here. you.

607
00:26:28.723 --> 00:26:30.557
Oh. Oh. shit.

608
00:26:59.852 --> 00:27:01.090
Hi. Teddy.

609
00:27:01.693 --> 00:27:03.388
What are you doing up there?

610
00:27:04.529 --> 00:27:06.292
Why are you so dirty?

611
00:27:09.897 --> 00:27:12.838
Clementine! Look at you.

612
00:27:19.042 --> 00:27:21.043
We're gonna have
to talk about that.

613
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:52.902
-Who the hell are you?
-Who the hell are you?

614
00:28:52.971 --> 00:28:54.903
-Well. I live here!
-I live here!

615
00:28:54.971 --> 00:28:57.375
-This is my bed.
-This is my bed.

616
00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:58.436
-Really?
-What?

617
00:28:58.838 --> 00:29:01.106
What a coincidence! We both
have a one-eyed teddy bear?

618
00:29:01.175 --> 00:29:02.842
-What? Oh.

619
00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:04.145
Why are you naked?

620
00:29:04.214 --> 00:29:05.984
I don't know. I guess I...
I took a shower.

621
00:29:06.053 --> 00:29:08.179
-I'm calling the police.
-Do I look scary? I'm naked.

622
00:29:08.248 --> 00:29:09.480
That's exactly what's scary.

623
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:11.957
-Don't... Don't call the cops.
-9-1-1.

624
00:29:12.025 --> 00:29:14.024
<i>-911. What's your emergency?</i>

625
00:29:14.093 --> 00:29:16.389
There is a naked deranged man
in my house.

626
00:29:16.458 --> 00:29:17.990
-Not deranged. actually.
<i>-Does he have a weapon?</i>

627
00:29:18.058 --> 00:29:19.092
Do you have a weapon?

628
00:29:19.161 --> 00:29:20.498
Do I look like
I have a weapon?

629
00:29:22.568 --> 00:29:23.969
-Ow.
-Karma.

630
00:29:24.038 --> 00:29:25.735
That's what you get
for breaking into my house.

631
00:29:25.804 --> 00:29:26.966
<i>Ma'am. are you in danger?</i>

632
00:29:27.034 --> 00:29:28.268
Oh. I didn't break in.

633
00:29:28.537 --> 00:29:30.873
Jesus! I used the spare key
under the flower pot.

634
00:29:30.942 --> 00:29:32.911
Wha...
And how did you know

635
00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:35.140
there's a spare key
under my flower pot?

636
00:29:35.209 --> 00:29:36.374
Because there's a spare key

637
00:29:36.443 --> 00:29:38.016
under every flower pot
in Norwood.

638
00:29:38.084 --> 00:29:39.512
Ha! You're not in Norwood.
you're in Westwood.

639
00:29:39.581 --> 00:29:40.945
<i>Ma'am. can you please</i>
<i>repeat the address?</i>

640
00:29:41.014 --> 00:29:42.650
I am? Jesus.

641
00:29:43.152 --> 00:29:44.588
-Thanks a lot. Gevorg.
-Who?

642
00:29:44.657 --> 00:29:46.057
Who's that? Are you alone?

643
00:29:46.126 --> 00:29:47.253
<i>Is there another intruder</i>
<i>in the house?</i>

644
00:29:47.322 --> 00:29:49.688
Yeah. of course. I'm alone.
I think.

645
00:29:49.757 --> 00:29:53.093
Oh. no. I'm gonna die. This is
just like<i> Basic Instinct.</i>

646
00:29:53.162 --> 00:29:54.727
No. no. no. In<i> Basic Instinct</i> .

647
00:29:54.796 --> 00:29:56.663
she ties the guy to the bed
and kills him with an icepick.

648
00:29:56.732 --> 00:29:58.965
So. if this is<i> Basic Instinct</i> .
then I should be scared.

649
00:29:59.034 --> 00:30:00.301
Then it's<i> Jagged Edge.</i>

650
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.601
In<i> Jagged Edge</i> . Jeff Bridges
is wearing a ski mask.

651
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:04.372
-I'm wearing a towel.
-Then it's<i> Rear Window.</i>

652
00:30:04.441 --> 00:30:06.271
In<i> Rear Window</i> .
Jimmy Stewart is in a cast.

653
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:07.879
and Raymond Burr
kills his wife

654
00:30:07.948 --> 00:30:09.141
in a completely
different apartment.

655
00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:10.476
It doesn't even make sense.

656
00:30:10.544 --> 00:30:11.915
<i>Ma'am. do you</i>
<i>even watch movies?</i>

657
00:30:11.984 --> 00:30:13.181
I don't always
make it to the end.

658
00:30:13.516 --> 00:30:15.086
I don't know what's going on
here. but I'm harmless.

659
00:30:15.154 --> 00:30:16.848
-Okay? I swear.
<i>-He sounds harmless to me.</i>

660
00:30:16.917 --> 00:30:18.120
Fine.

661
00:30:18.522 --> 00:30:20.688
But if he dismembers me and
makes lamps out of my skin.

662
00:30:20.757 --> 00:30:22.125
it's on you.

663
00:30:22.594 --> 00:30:24.121
Just stay. sit.

664
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:26.228
Don't bleed on anything.

665
00:30:28.468 --> 00:30:29.664
Oh. my God.

666
00:30:35.841 --> 00:30:37.269
-Here.
-Ow!

667
00:30:37.337 --> 00:30:39.373
-That hurts.
-You're welcome.

668
00:30:41.879 --> 00:30:43.744
-Not to be weird.

669
00:30:43.813 --> 00:30:45.681
but have we met?

670
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.581
No. we haven't met.

671
00:30:48.117 --> 00:30:50.019
I... I'm a real-estate agent.

672
00:30:50.088 --> 00:30:53.052
Maybe you've seen my face
on a park bench.

673
00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.026
Mm... No. that wasn't it.

674
00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:58.997
Oh. my God! Last night
at Bennigan's parking lot.

675
00:30:59.699 --> 00:31:00.995
Okay. are you stalking me?

676
00:31:01.064 --> 00:31:02.765
No. oh. my God. no. I swear.

677
00:31:02.834 --> 00:31:03.965
I don't know why I'm here.

678
00:31:04.034 --> 00:31:05.768
But I live at 15 Maple Drive.

679
00:31:05.837 --> 00:31:07.836
This is 15 Maple Drive.

680
00:31:08.238 --> 00:31:11.376
What?
No. that's... that's crazy.

681
00:31:12.573 --> 00:31:13.911
-Oh. no. who's that?
-How should I know?

682
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.179
Apparently.
this is your house.

683
00:31:17.647 --> 00:31:18.650
Kip?

684
00:31:18.719 --> 00:31:19.914
-What do you want?
-My tux.

685
00:31:19.983 --> 00:31:21.149
I texted you I was coming.

686
00:31:21.218 --> 00:31:23.185
I didn't get it.
I... I blocked you.

687
00:31:23.254 --> 00:31:25.385
-A bit soon. don't you think?
-Goodbye.

688
00:31:25.454 --> 00:31:27.753
Just let me get my tux.
And I'll be gone.

689
00:31:27.822 --> 00:31:30.293
The tux you were supposed to
wear to my sister's wedding?

690
00:31:30.361 --> 00:31:32.292
Yeah. it's a really nice tux.
And I have a...

691
00:31:32.361 --> 00:31:33.992
-- Fuck.

692
00:31:36.034 --> 00:31:37.765
-Um... Uh...

693
00:31:37.834 --> 00:31:39.166
Hi. This...

694
00:31:39.235 --> 00:31:40.765
-I...
-Who the hell is this?

695
00:31:40.834 --> 00:31:42.704
-I don't know. Who are you?
-I'm her boyfriend.

696
00:31:42.773 --> 00:31:43.975
Ex-boyfriend.

697
00:31:44.044 --> 00:31:46.276
We broke up
less than 24 hours ago.

698
00:31:46.345 --> 00:31:48.881
And there's already some
naked guy in your apartment?

699
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.714
-I mean. how...
-We didn't break up.

700
00:31:50.782 --> 00:31:52.316
You broke up with me.

701
00:31:52.385 --> 00:31:54.580
Wait. you broke up with her
right before New Year's Eve?

702
00:31:55.181 --> 00:31:56.214
What a dick!

703
00:31:56.282 --> 00:31:57.483
I know. right? Thank you.

704
00:31:57.552 --> 00:31:59.858
The naked dude
is calling me a dick.

705
00:31:59.927 --> 00:32:01.190
What? Do you have
a problem with that?

706
00:32:01.259 --> 00:32:03.560
Trust me.
you should hope that I don't.

707
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:04.522
Okay. no. no. no.

708
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.000
You will not
threaten my guest.

709
00:32:08.767 --> 00:32:09.831
What is going on here?

710
00:32:10.167 --> 00:32:12.602
Are you drunk?
Is this all you?

711
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:13.664
So. what if I am?

712
00:32:14.066 --> 00:32:16.301
You've drunken some rosé and
you've picked up some loser.

713
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.001
Actually. I'm a lawyer. so...

714
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.309
You are?

715
00:32:19.511 --> 00:32:20.506
Ha.

716
00:32:20.775 --> 00:32:22.345
You don't even know what
naked guy does for a living.

717
00:32:22.413 --> 00:32:23.945
He could be a serial killer.
he could be crazy.

718
00:32:24.013 --> 00:32:25.314
I'm not naked anymore.

719
00:32:25.383 --> 00:32:27.112
Yeah. he can be naked
if he wants to be naked.

720
00:32:27.181 --> 00:32:28.382
In fact. we can be naked

721
00:32:28.451 --> 00:32:29.681
all over the place
if we want to be.

722
00:32:30.283 --> 00:32:31.518
What does that mean?

723
00:32:31.921 --> 00:32:33.355
It means...

724
00:32:34.821 --> 00:32:36.892
do you want to go to a wedding
with me tonight?

725
00:32:36.961 --> 00:32:39.130
- Wh... Mm... Uh...

726
00:32:50.108 --> 00:32:52.308
All right. okay.
I've seen enough.

727
00:32:57.914 --> 00:32:59.376
Goodbye. Kip.

728
00:32:59.445 --> 00:33:00.477
-Seriously?
-I mean.

729
00:33:00.546 --> 00:33:02.021
it felt pretty serious to me.

730
00:33:02.089 --> 00:33:04.819
Okay. no. I get it now.
This is a test.

731
00:33:06.357 --> 00:33:08.126
Fortunately. for you.
I went through

732
00:33:08.195 --> 00:33:11.993
a grueling heart chakra
healing this morning

733
00:33:12.062 --> 00:33:14.358
with my guru over Zoom.

734
00:33:14.427 --> 00:33:16.264
So. I am not about to lose

735
00:33:16.332 --> 00:33:18.295
the progress that I made
over this.

736
00:33:18.364 --> 00:33:19.571
-Okay.
-Okay.

737
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.634
But. if I see you again.

738
00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.071
Sadeep is not going
to be happy.

739
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.573
Okay. okay. enough.

740
00:33:28.382 --> 00:33:29.448
Goodbye.

741
00:33:29.517 --> 00:33:30.408
Oh. my God.

742
00:33:30.477 --> 00:33:32.678
-I am so sorry.
-Oh. no.

743
00:33:32.746 --> 00:33:35.015
I don't know
what came over me. I was...

744
00:33:35.084 --> 00:33:36.418
It's totally fine.

745
00:33:36.487 --> 00:33:38.416
But. you know.
I should get going.

746
00:33:38.485 --> 00:33:40.284
Um... Yeah. I was... I just...

747
00:33:40.353 --> 00:33:42.556
About the wedding...

748
00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:44.288
Oh. that was real?

749
00:33:44.357 --> 00:33:46.129
You probably have plans.

750
00:33:46.198 --> 00:33:48.327
I mean. yeah.
you could say that.

751
00:33:48.396 --> 00:33:50.234
Yeah. and I mean. who would...

752
00:33:50.303 --> 00:33:52.164
who would go to a wedding
with a total stranger

753
00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:53.503
on New Year's Eve?

754
00:33:55.274 --> 00:33:59.337
Um... Well. this has. uh.
been interesting.

755
00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.781
You see. my sister is getting
married in about two hours.

756
00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.483
And I'm the maid of honor.

757
00:34:05.552 --> 00:34:07.846
And that guy who just left was
supposed to be my plus one.

758
00:34:07.915 --> 00:34:09.584
And everyone was like.
"Don't get your hopes up."

759
00:34:09.653 --> 00:34:11.349
But. what did I do?
I went and got my hopes up.

760
00:34:11.417 --> 00:34:13.989
and it's $40 a plate.

761
00:34:14.058 --> 00:34:15.290
And if I show up alone.

762
00:34:15.359 --> 00:34:16.921
I'll have to sit
next to an empty chair

763
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:19.657
surrounded by happy couples
and judgy relatives.

764
00:34:19.726 --> 00:34:21.327
and I'll be
the last girl standing

765
00:34:21.396 --> 00:34:22.828
when the band starts to play.

766
00:34:22.897 --> 00:34:24.598
And the first girl shoved out
onto the dance floor

767
00:34:24.666 --> 00:34:27.338
to catch that stupid
overpriced bouquet.

768
00:34:27.407 --> 00:34:32.472
And I mean. I would rather die
a slow and painful death

769
00:34:32.541 --> 00:34:34.541
than participate
in that humiliating

770
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:36.312
sexist
<i>Hunger Games</i> tradition...

771
00:34:36.381 --> 00:34:38.715
You know? I just...
Aah!

772
00:34:38.784 --> 00:34:39.983
- Ah...

773
00:34:40.052 --> 00:34:42.718
Look. I. um... I really can't.

774
00:34:43.154 --> 00:34:44.552
I really... I really can't.

775
00:34:45.956 --> 00:34:47.055
No. of course.

776
00:34:47.124 --> 00:34:48.352
I mean. I sound psycho.

777
00:34:48.421 --> 00:34:50.195
No. no. not at all.

778
00:34:50.795 --> 00:34:52.164
Um...

779
00:34:54.296 --> 00:34:55.565
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

780
00:34:56.335 --> 00:34:58.729
- Oh. yeah.
It's my favorite movie.

781
00:34:58.798 --> 00:35:00.733
My cat's name is Cat.

782
00:35:01.509 --> 00:35:02.367
Mine too.

783
00:35:02.435 --> 00:35:03.635
You have a cat named Cat?

784
00:35:03.704 --> 00:35:05.574
No. uh.
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

785
00:35:05.643 --> 00:35:07.777
I have a<i> Breakfast</i>
<i>at Tiffany's</i> poster

786
00:35:07.846 --> 00:35:08.875
in my kitchen.

787
00:35:09.244 --> 00:35:10.776
My cat is named Ted.

788
00:35:15.982 --> 00:35:19.756
Well. anyway. um. thanks
for not calling the cops.

789
00:35:19.825 --> 00:35:20.851
Yeah. thanks

790
00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.386
-for not murdering me.

791
00:35:22.455 --> 00:35:25.494
Okay. well. goodbye.

792
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.570
-Yes?
-Hey.

793
00:35:39.639 --> 00:35:41.840
Uh. I just. I forgot my bag.

794
00:35:42.709 --> 00:35:44.145
-Oh. Oh.
-It's right over there.

795
00:35:44.214 --> 00:35:45.645
-Sure.
-Thank you.

796
00:35:45.714 --> 00:35:48.684
Thank you
and I'm sorry about all this.

797
00:35:48.753 --> 00:35:50.355
But. um.

798
00:35:50.857 --> 00:35:52.349
yeah. Goodbye. again.

799
00:35:52.418 --> 00:35:53.953
Yeah. Goodbye.

800
00:35:54.022 --> 00:35:55.260
Forever.

801
00:36:04.898 --> 00:36:07.973
Okay. I just.
I'd have to leave by- 00.

802
00:36:08.375 --> 00:36:10.902
Yes! Thank you.
thank you. thank you.

803
00:36:10.971 --> 00:36:12.737
-Thank you. thank you.
-It's okay. All right.

804
00:36:12.806 --> 00:36:14.545
-Thank you. thank you.
-Yes. yes.

805
00:36:15.515 --> 00:36:17.277
How are you gonna explain
bringing me to this wedding?

806
00:36:17.346 --> 00:36:18.913
I'm not. You'll be Kip.

807
00:36:18.982 --> 00:36:21.384
Wait. you want me to pretend
to be the dick who just left?

808
00:36:21.453 --> 00:36:24.016
Please.
It'll just be so much easier.

809
00:36:24.084 --> 00:36:26.454
And you could leave as soon
as the ceremony's done.

810
00:36:26.522 --> 00:36:27.985
Please.
you'll be saving my life.

811
00:36:29.062 --> 00:36:30.994
Does Kip have a job?

812
00:36:31.063 --> 00:36:32.493
Of course. you have a job.

813
00:36:32.561 --> 00:36:34.429
I wouldn't date
a complete loser.

814
00:36:34.498 --> 00:36:35.559
You're a commercial
contractor.

815
00:36:35.627 --> 00:36:36.995
You own your own company.

816
00:36:37.063 --> 00:36:38.534
Okay. well. I don't
really know anything about

817
00:36:38.602 --> 00:36:41.035
being a contractor
because I'm a lawyer.

818
00:36:41.104 --> 00:36:42.539
Oh. perfect.

819
00:36:42.608 --> 00:36:44.901
Don't you guys basically lie
for a living?

820
00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:47.004
-Here. you can use mine.

821
00:36:50.844 --> 00:36:53.147
- This is a 42 long.
I'm a 40.

822
00:36:53.216 --> 00:36:54.417
- It's Armani.

823
00:36:54.486 --> 00:36:55.885
Just keep your hands
in the pockets.

824
00:36:56.555 --> 00:36:59.223
Wait.
so if no one's met him yet.

825
00:36:59.292 --> 00:37:00.886
then why can't
I just be a lawyer?

826
00:37:00.954 --> 00:37:02.553
Because they already know
he's a contractor.

827
00:37:02.621 --> 00:37:03.788
Oh. and a black belt.

828
00:37:03.857 --> 00:37:05.429
-He's a black belt?
-Yeah. but relax.

829
00:37:05.498 --> 00:37:06.557
It's not like
you're getting into a fight

830
00:37:06.626 --> 00:37:07.859
at my sister's wedding.

831
00:37:07.928 --> 00:37:10.064
So. how long
have you guys been dating?

832
00:37:10.466 --> 00:37:13.734
Had been. Almost three months.

833
00:37:14.468 --> 00:37:15.900
Wait. three months

834
00:37:15.969 --> 00:37:17.436
and not a single person
in your life

835
00:37:17.505 --> 00:37:18.504
has met your boyfriend?

836
00:37:18.573 --> 00:37:20.312
He was busy. People are busy.

837
00:37:20.381 --> 00:37:22.281
Can we dispense
with the Twenty Questions?

838
00:37:23.476 --> 00:37:24.746
I need a zip.

839
00:37:25.182 --> 00:37:26.651
- Oh. yeah.

840
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.781
Okay.

841
00:37:38.229 --> 00:37:39.597
I'm Margot. by the way.

842
00:37:39.666 --> 00:37:40.864
Griffin.

843
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.533
Griffin?
Wait. your name is Griffin?

844
00:37:43.602 --> 00:37:45.630
Yes. like the mythical
creature.

845
00:37:45.699 --> 00:37:48.065
Part lion. part bird. I know.

846
00:37:53.577 --> 00:37:55.611
-- Uh...

847
00:37:57.912 --> 00:37:59.844
-We gotta go. gotta go.
-Yes. yes. yes.

848
00:37:59.913 --> 00:38:02.882
- Okay. Oh.
- Okay.

849
00:38:04.151 --> 00:38:06.183
Wait. Hold on. I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

850
00:38:06.251 --> 00:38:07.991
Yeah. you're forgetting
this isn't your house.

851
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:09.427
-Come on!
-Okay.

852
00:38:11.529 --> 00:38:13.398
-Oh. come on.

853
00:38:13.466 --> 00:38:15.796
Come on. come on. come on.
baby. come on.

854
00:38:15.864 --> 00:38:17.327
-Come on. come on. come on.

855
00:38:17.396 --> 00:38:18.563
Yes!

856
00:38:18.631 --> 00:38:19.963
Uh. wait. should I drive?

857
00:38:20.032 --> 00:38:22.641
You know. that is
such a man thing to say.

858
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.839
Like I'm incapable of starting
the car because I'm a woman

859
00:38:24.908 --> 00:38:27.107
and it happens to be
sub-zero temperatures outside?

860
00:38:27.176 --> 00:38:28.312
Good one.

861
00:38:28.714 --> 00:38:30.982
Or. perhaps because a DUI
will literally ruin your life.

862
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:32.780
And I at least had a nap.

863
00:38:33.786 --> 00:38:34.852
Oh.

864
00:38:35.421 --> 00:38:37.285
Well. that's actually
very sweet.

865
00:38:37.354 --> 00:38:38.654
-Switch?
-Yeah. please.

866
00:38:38.956 --> 00:38:40.584
No! Well. hold on. I'm gonna
go around. I'm going around.

867
00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:41.954
Around. around.

868
00:38:42.456 --> 00:38:44.792
Jeez!

869
00:38:46.328 --> 00:38:47.529
We need caffeine.

870
00:38:47.598 --> 00:38:48.928
Wait. are you sure
we have time?

871
00:38:48.997 --> 00:38:50.495
Yeah. there's always time
for coffee. let's go.

872
00:38:52.167 --> 00:38:53.765
- All right. do you
want to tell me what happened

873
00:38:53.834 --> 00:38:55.606
with. uh.
Mr. Armani back there?

874
00:38:55.675 --> 00:38:57.969
- It's a long story.
Not that interesting.

875
00:38:58.038 --> 00:38:59.610
Well. you know.
if it's any consolation.

876
00:38:59.678 --> 00:39:02.579
I'm pretty sure you dodged
a bullet back there.

877
00:39:03.279 --> 00:39:04.714
What about you?

878
00:39:04.783 --> 00:39:08.048
Did you dodge a bullet with
Miss Ginger Spice America?

879
00:39:09.485 --> 00:39:10.954
Her name is Clementine.

880
00:39:11.023 --> 00:39:12.721
Clementine?

881
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.753
Wow. It's not a name.
it's a tricky fruit.

882
00:39:15.822 --> 00:39:17.492
Tricky fruit? What is that?

883
00:39:17.894 --> 00:39:20.328
Tricky. Fake. looks all sweet
on the outside.

884
00:39:20.396 --> 00:39:22.597
all bright and orange.

885
00:39:22.666 --> 00:39:25.800
Then you peel it.
it's this dry sour pith.

886
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:31.370
No. My...
My Clementine is great.

887
00:39:31.439 --> 00:39:33.676
Hmm. Great.

888
00:39:35.074 --> 00:39:38.083
-I thought you guys broke up.

889
00:39:38.419 --> 00:39:41.280
What? No. why...
why would you say that?

890
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:42.787
Oh. um...

891
00:39:43.423 --> 00:39:45.586
'Cause she. you know.

892
00:39:45.655 --> 00:39:48.391
fled Bennigan's.
stole my Uber.

893
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.088
Plus. you're on a date
with me.

894
00:39:50.156 --> 00:39:52.662
We're not on a date.
I mean. this is a favor.

895
00:39:55.067 --> 00:39:56.298
Yeah. I mean.

896
00:39:56.801 --> 00:39:59.801
you know. you're on a favor
with me. So...

897
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.535
Mm...

898
00:40:02.138 --> 00:40:05.308
You know. I get it. it's fine.
You don't even know me.

899
00:40:05.377 --> 00:40:07.776
Let's just get this over with.

900
00:40:08.708 --> 00:40:09.976
Oh. it's left here.

901
00:40:10.044 --> 00:40:12.312
-Here. Here. here. here!
-Left where? Here? Jeez!

902
00:40:17.322 --> 00:40:18.848
Are you trying to kill us?

903
00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:20.824
A little notice next time.

904
00:40:25.698 --> 00:40:27.999
Why does it look like
the lights are out?

905
00:40:28.468 --> 00:40:30.366
-The sign says closed.
-No. no. no. no.

906
00:40:30.435 --> 00:40:32.029
this cannot be happening! No!

907
00:40:32.098 --> 00:40:33.536
I can't believe
they closed early.

908
00:40:33.605 --> 00:40:35.032
I mean. how could
they do this to me?

909
00:40:35.101 --> 00:40:37.070
Well. you wanted
to stop for coffee. so...

910
00:40:37.139 --> 00:40:39.271
I'm bringing a stranger
to my sister's wedding.

911
00:40:39.339 --> 00:40:42.008
Do I look like I make
good decisions under pressure?

912
00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:44.242
Let's break in.

913
00:40:45.011 --> 00:40:46.418
-Wait. what now?
-I cannot show up

914
00:40:46.487 --> 00:40:47.783
without the veil.
I will be disowned

915
00:40:47.852 --> 00:40:48.851
-after they kill me!
-Where are you going?

916
00:40:50.021 --> 00:40:52.283
- Oh! I can climb
on this and go in that window.

917
00:40:52.352 --> 00:40:54.890
Oh. my. God. are you crazy?
Burglary is a felony.

918
00:40:54.959 --> 00:40:56.920
What do you suggest? I don't
think there's a spare key

919
00:40:56.989 --> 00:40:58.288
hiding under the flower pot.

920
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:01.027
Plus. it's not stealing if
it's your own property. So...

921
00:41:01.096 --> 00:41:02.733
Um. actually. it's called
breaking and entering.

922
00:41:02.802 --> 00:41:04.368
And you can get up to
three months in county jail.

923
00:41:04.603 --> 00:41:07.302
-Oh. Well. that's doable.
-Oh. my God.

924
00:41:08.439 --> 00:41:10.003
Come on. it's just a veil.

925
00:41:10.771 --> 00:41:12.375
-- Hmm?
-Well...

926
00:41:12.444 --> 00:41:14.043
Sorry. what? "Just a veil"?

927
00:41:14.112 --> 00:41:16.711
Well. yeah. I mean. it's just
like a piece of fabric. right?

928
00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.143
So. can't she just.
I don't know.

929
00:41:18.211 --> 00:41:20.277
find something else?
Like a towel or a sheet?

930
00:41:20.345 --> 00:41:23.146
Okay. You want
my sister to get married

931
00:41:23.215 --> 00:41:25.018
with a sheet
wrapped around her head?

932
00:41:25.487 --> 00:41:26.756
A pretty sheet?

933
00:41:28.457 --> 00:41:29.625
Okay. just move.

934
00:41:29.694 --> 00:41:31.693
Okay. there's nothing
you can say

935
00:41:31.762 --> 00:41:32.959
that's gonna
talk me out of this.

936
00:41:33.261 --> 00:41:34.661
No. I'm saying you're not
tall enough to get up there.

937
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.865
So. just move. Let me do it.

938
00:41:37.366 --> 00:41:39.571
Oh. Okay.

939
00:41:40.303 --> 00:41:41.837
Thank you.

940
00:41:44.376 --> 00:41:46.941
Hmm. all right. This is...

941
00:41:50.977 --> 00:41:52.781
- Okay. All right. here.

942
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:53.844
-Let me. let me help you.
-- No.

943
00:41:53.913 --> 00:41:56.182
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

944
00:41:56.251 --> 00:41:59.524
-Oh! Sorry. okay. Okay. Okay.
-- Yes. Yeah.

945
00:41:59.593 --> 00:42:03.359
Here we go. okay. okay.
Okay. Here we go.

946
00:42:03.428 --> 00:42:05.026
-Almost. Yeah.
-Go. Go.

947
00:42:05.094 --> 00:42:08.364
Okay. okay. okay. okay.
okay. that's my head.

948
00:42:10.598 --> 00:42:12.635
-Oh. no.
-Oh. no.

949
00:42:12.703 --> 00:42:14.272
-- Oh! Shit!

950
00:42:14.341 --> 00:42:15.573
-Okay.

951
00:42:15.642 --> 00:42:16.938
-uh. what do I do?

952
00:42:17.007 --> 00:42:19.042
-What do I do?
-Just meet me around front.

953
00:42:19.111 --> 00:42:19.969
Okay.

954
00:42:20.038 --> 00:42:22.279
- Wait. wait. wait.

955
00:42:22.348 --> 00:42:23.709
What's your sister's name?

956
00:42:23.777 --> 00:42:26.217
Carrie. Carrie Hayes.

957
00:42:26.286 --> 00:42:28.917
-Yeah. Oh. shit!
-Shit.

958
00:42:31.218 --> 00:42:33.416
-I have the veil! Ha-ha! Yeah.
-My hero!

959
00:42:33.485 --> 00:42:35.588
Oh. thank you. thank you.
thank you. thank you.

960
00:42:35.657 --> 00:42:38.024
Oh. perfect.

961
00:42:38.093 --> 00:42:39.725
-All right. let's go.
-Let's do it.

962
00:42:39.793 --> 00:42:41.059
Oh. wait. one second.

963
00:42:41.128 --> 00:42:42.534
- Wait.
what are you doing?

964
00:42:42.603 --> 00:42:43.799
- I have
to leave some money

965
00:42:43.868 --> 00:42:45.899
because I. uh.
broke a display case.

966
00:42:45.968 --> 00:42:48.334
I'm a fugitive
with Mother Teresa.

967
00:42:48.503 --> 00:42:49.773
Okay.

968
00:42:50.606 --> 00:42:52.677
All righty. Do it.

969
00:42:58.011 --> 00:43:00.748
No. No. no. no. no. no. No!

970
00:43:00.816 --> 00:43:02.280
Don't panic. no.
It's just cold.

971
00:43:05.325 --> 00:43:06.591
-And dead.
-Try again.

972
00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.655
-Try again. try again.
-Come on. baby.

973
00:43:12.132 --> 00:43:13.291
No!

974
00:43:20.405 --> 00:43:21.805
- Come on. Uber!

975
00:43:21.873 --> 00:43:24.203
Well. someone has to
come by eventually.

976
00:43:26.373 --> 00:43:29.577
Carrie was right.
I am gonna ruin her wedding.

977
00:43:29.645 --> 00:43:30.946
Well. I mean. listen.

978
00:43:31.015 --> 00:43:31.975
if two people are destined
to be together.

979
00:43:32.043 --> 00:43:33.718
then nothing can ruin it.

980
00:43:34.419 --> 00:43:35.586
You don't know my sister.

981
00:43:35.655 --> 00:43:36.950
She would call
the whole thing off

982
00:43:37.019 --> 00:43:38.586
just so she could
hold it over my head

983
00:43:38.655 --> 00:43:39.855
for the rest of our lives.

984
00:43:39.924 --> 00:43:41.660
I'd say you guys
don't really get along.

985
00:43:42.425 --> 00:43:43.525
No. we do.

986
00:43:43.593 --> 00:43:44.993
We're just different.

987
00:43:45.062 --> 00:43:47.396
Her life is perfectly planned
and executed

988
00:43:47.465 --> 00:43:48.698
down to the last detail.

989
00:43:48.766 --> 00:43:52.667
and I ate expired yogurt
for lunch.

990
00:43:52.736 --> 00:43:54.706
Wait. that yogurt was expired?

991
00:43:55.306 --> 00:43:56.339
Jesus!

992
00:43:56.408 --> 00:43:57.941
Ever since we were kids.

993
00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:00.037
Carrie made me feel like
I could never live up to her.

994
00:44:00.106 --> 00:44:01.505
So. I didn't bother trying.

995
00:44:01.574 --> 00:44:04.441
-Okay. So. it's her fault.
-I'm not saying that.

996
00:44:05.144 --> 00:44:07.217
Okay. maybe I am saying that.

997
00:44:07.786 --> 00:44:09.083
I bet you don't know
what it's like

998
00:44:09.152 --> 00:44:11.523
to be a constant
disappointment to your family.

999
00:44:11.591 --> 00:44:13.922
No. but I am
like an only child

1000
00:44:13.991 --> 00:44:15.955
to the world's happiest.
happy couple ever.

1001
00:44:16.024 --> 00:44:17.994
Wow. does
Social Services know?

1002
00:44:18.062 --> 00:44:19.795
-Okay. No. I'm serious though.

1003
00:44:19.864 --> 00:44:21.360
It's like the bar
is already so high.

1004
00:44:21.428 --> 00:44:23.635
And then. I'm like
their sole purpose in life.

1005
00:44:23.704 --> 00:44:24.928
So. I'm just excited
to get married.

1006
00:44:24.997 --> 00:44:26.397
so they'll finally have.

1007
00:44:26.466 --> 00:44:28.135
you know. someone else
to focus on for once.

1008
00:44:28.203 --> 00:44:30.201
Oh. are you getting married
soon?

1009
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.968
Well. I mean.
not tomorrow but...

1010
00:44:32.037 --> 00:44:33.771
- Go! Go!

1011
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:35.273
Hey! Wait!

1012
00:44:35.342 --> 00:44:37.782
-- Margot. wait!
-Whoa! Shit.

1013
00:44:39.619 --> 00:44:41.849
- Excuse me!
- Margot!

1014
00:44:41.918 --> 00:44:44.147
-Excuse me! Excuse me!
-Go!

1015
00:44:44.216 --> 00:44:46.854
-Go! Go!
-Hello! Excuse me!

1016
00:44:46.923 --> 00:44:47.921
-Margot. wait!
-- Wait!

1017
00:44:47.989 --> 00:44:49.494
- Driver?
- Hold on.

1018
00:44:49.563 --> 00:44:51.026
- Driver!
- Wait.

1019
00:44:51.561 --> 00:44:52.628
Whoa. Whoa.

1020
00:44:53.331 --> 00:44:57.627
Hi! Thank you.
Thank you. our car broke down.

1021
00:44:57.696 --> 00:45:00.836
My sister's getting married
tonight and I am so late.

1022
00:45:00.905 --> 00:45:02.234
- Okay.
I have got the boot.

1023
00:45:02.303 --> 00:45:03.738
-Cinderella.
-- Ooh. your shoe!

1024
00:45:03.807 --> 00:45:05.106
- Oh! My... My prince.

1025
00:45:05.475 --> 00:45:07.143
-- Yeah. yeah. just...
-He's harmless. he's with me.

1026
00:45:07.211 --> 00:45:08.338
-Oh. oh. Thank you. okay...
-Put your foot in here.

1027
00:45:08.407 --> 00:45:09.777
-...I got it.
-Well. come on up!

1028
00:45:09.846 --> 00:45:10.978
-- Really?
-Yes.

1029
00:45:11.047 --> 00:45:12.244
- Cool.
- Thank you.

1030
00:45:12.313 --> 00:45:13.851
- Hotel's like
three miles away.

1031
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.947
so. you know. we were
actually just gonna walk.

1032
00:45:15.016 --> 00:45:16.415
But this is probably better.

1033
00:45:16.484 --> 00:45:18.351
- Ooh. you're saving
our lives. Seriously.

1034
00:45:21.795 --> 00:45:23.955
So. what brings
you both out tonight?

1035
00:45:24.023 --> 00:45:25.457
It's our anniversary.

1036
00:45:25.526 --> 00:45:27.729
Always take my bride to dinner
on New Year's Eve.

1037
00:45:27.798 --> 00:45:28.794
-- Aw!

1038
00:45:28.863 --> 00:45:29.927
Happy anniversary!

1039
00:45:29.996 --> 00:45:31.429
Fifty-eight years.

1040
00:45:31.497 --> 00:45:34.431
And he is still the most
romantic man I ever met.

1041
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.542
Fifty-eight years?
That's incredible!

1042
00:45:38.611 --> 00:45:40.005
So is your coat. by the way.

1043
00:45:40.074 --> 00:45:42.012
Ooh. this is my lucky coat.

1044
00:45:42.081 --> 00:45:44.845
I met the man of my dreams
because of this coat.

1045
00:45:44.914 --> 00:45:46.079
- Because of the coat?

1046
00:45:46.148 --> 00:45:47.649
Sounds like
there's a story there.

1047
00:45:47.717 --> 00:45:49.553
Go on. dear. You tell it.

1048
00:45:49.622 --> 00:45:50.888
Oh. they don't want to hear

1049
00:45:50.956 --> 00:45:52.723
how a couple old coots met
50 years ago.

1050
00:45:52.792 --> 00:45:53.922
-Yes. we do!
-What? Yeah. we do.

1051
00:45:54.158 --> 00:45:55.959
-We definitely want to hear.
-- Please.

1052
00:45:56.526 --> 00:45:57.729
Well.

1053
00:45:57.798 --> 00:46:00.226
it was a drizzly.
gray October morning.

1054
00:46:00.295 --> 00:46:02.062
I was taking the ferry
over to Manhattan

1055
00:46:02.131 --> 00:46:04.097
to meet my buddy. Hank.
for lunch.

1056
00:46:04.166 --> 00:46:06.031
So. the ferry pulls
into the port

1057
00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.232
and I see this beautiful girl

1058
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:11.809
wearing a carnation pink coat.

1059
00:46:11.878 --> 00:46:14.239
-I was love-struck. frozen.

1060
00:46:14.308 --> 00:46:15.979
When I finally
got my legs to move.

1061
00:46:16.048 --> 00:46:17.847
I chased after her
but lost her in the crowd.

1062
00:46:17.916 --> 00:46:19.213
-Wait. you lost her?
-You lost her?

1063
00:46:19.282 --> 00:46:22.116
I was crushed. I figured
I'd go see a matinee.

1064
00:46:22.185 --> 00:46:24.620
So. I walked over
to the Astor on Broadway.

1065
00:46:24.688 --> 00:46:25.889
And would you believe it?

1066
00:46:25.958 --> 00:46:27.859
Who walks in
and sits one seat over?

1067
00:46:27.927 --> 00:46:30.525
But the girl
in the carnation pink coat.

1068
00:46:31.662 --> 00:46:32.693
-Come on!
-No way!

1069
00:46:32.762 --> 00:46:34.096
So. the movie ends

1070
00:46:34.165 --> 00:46:35.593
and I follow her into
the lobby and ask her.

1071
00:46:35.662 --> 00:46:38.669
would she like to go
have a piece of pie with me?

1072
00:46:38.737 --> 00:46:40.096
-She said. "No."
-- "No"?

1073
00:46:40.165 --> 00:46:41.471
- I had plans.

1074
00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:42.902
To meet my cousin.

1075
00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:44.238
- So. I asked her.

1076
00:46:44.306 --> 00:46:45.741
"Would you please
give me your phone number?

1077
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.241
"And I'll call you tomorrow."

1078
00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:51.211
Again. she said. "No."
Turned and walked out.

1079
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.443
-- Oh. no.
-You just walked away?

1080
00:46:53.511 --> 00:46:56.149
Give a strange man
my phone number?

1081
00:46:56.217 --> 00:46:58.084
My mother would've
had my hide.

1082
00:46:58.152 --> 00:46:59.956
So. I go to meet
my buddy. Hank.

1083
00:47:00.025 --> 00:47:02.894
over at Stardust Diner
on 52nd Street.

1084
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.492
<i>I walked in.</i>
<i>and would you believe it?</i>

1085
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.329
<i>Draped over the back</i>
<i>of the booth</i>

1086
00:47:09.398 --> 00:47:12.336
<i>-was a carnation pink coat.</i>

1087
00:47:26.049 --> 00:47:28.581
-That was that.
-- Mm.

1088
00:47:29.251 --> 00:47:30.546
- Two months later.
we eloped.

1089
00:47:30.615 --> 00:47:32.952
And that was
58 years ago tonight.

1090
00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.454
Simply. a matter of fate.

1091
00:47:37.026 --> 00:47:40.330
Wow! That's a beautiful story.

1092
00:47:41.133 --> 00:47:43.596
Nothing like that
would ever happen on Tinder.

1093
00:47:44.266 --> 00:47:46.971
I mean.
not that I'm on Tinder.

1094
00:47:47.773 --> 00:47:49.202
Our son is gonna pick us up.

1095
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:50.401
Why don't you folks
keep the carriage

1096
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:51.776
-for the rest of the night?
-Oh.

1097
00:47:51.844 --> 00:47:52.939
-Really?
-- Are you serious?

1098
00:47:53.007 --> 00:47:54.374
That would be amazing.

1099
00:47:55.877 --> 00:47:57.074
- Whoa.

1100
00:47:57.143 --> 00:47:59.247
Here we are. folks.

1101
00:48:00.048 --> 00:48:01.080
- Happy anniversary.

1102
00:48:01.149 --> 00:48:02.981
Go on. dear. You take this.

1103
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.550
Oh. no. no. no. I can't.

1104
00:48:04.619 --> 00:48:07.624
A pretty girl like you
can't be going to a wedding

1105
00:48:07.692 --> 00:48:09.593
in such an ugly coat.

1106
00:48:09.661 --> 00:48:11.194
Uh...

1107
00:48:11.263 --> 00:48:14.265
Well. it's your lucky coat.
I wouldn't feel right.

1108
00:48:14.334 --> 00:48:17.897
Dear. when the universe hands
you a gift. you don't say no.

1109
00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:21.698
Well. okay.
Only if you take mine.

1110
00:48:24.042 --> 00:48:25.603
-Look at that!
-- Thank you.

1111
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:27.945
- Well.

1112
00:48:28.147 --> 00:48:29.376
-Lovely meeting you.
-He's a keeper.

1113
00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.347
Oh. um...

1114
00:48:35.416 --> 00:48:36.880
-What was the movie?
-Sorry. son?

1115
00:48:36.948 --> 00:48:39.985
The matinee at the Astor.
You know. the day you two met.

1116
00:48:40.054 --> 00:48:42.688
Ah! Audrey Hepburn.

1117
00:48:42.756 --> 00:48:44.858
-<i> Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>
-<i> Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

1118
00:48:44.927 --> 00:48:46.195
- Still our favorite.

1119
00:48:48.763 --> 00:48:49.829
Wow.

1120
00:48:50.432 --> 00:48:51.561
Will you take this
and just make sure

1121
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:53.400
you pay
for that couple's meal.

1122
00:48:53.468 --> 00:48:55.033
I'll just come by
in the morning to grab it.

1123
00:48:55.102 --> 00:48:56.233
Thank you so much.

1124
00:48:56.301 --> 00:48:57.601
What did you just do?

1125
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:59.472
Oh. I just gave him
my credit card.

1126
00:48:59.541 --> 00:49:01.072
I thought we should
treat them to dinner.

1127
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:03.873
You just gave a stranger
your credit card?

1128
00:49:03.942 --> 00:49:06.044
Yeah. it's fine. I'll just
come get it in the morning.

1129
00:49:06.113 --> 00:49:07.414
It's not a big deal.

1130
00:49:42.649 --> 00:49:44.321
- Easy.
- Ah. Here we are.

1131
00:49:44.389 --> 00:49:46.056
- All right. Thank you.
thank you. thank you.

1132
00:49:46.125 --> 00:49:47.517
Thank you so much. Sir.
Sorry. move.

1133
00:49:47.585 --> 00:49:48.921
I'm coming with you.

1134
00:49:49.457 --> 00:49:50.957
Thank you so much.
Happy New Year.

1135
00:49:51.025 --> 00:49:52.360
Happy New Year.

1136
00:49:52.429 --> 00:49:54.332
-- Thank you.
-Ah. thank you so much.

1137
00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:58.464
Okay. So. Dad is Paul.
Mom is Judy.

1138
00:49:58.533 --> 00:50:00.698
Remember. you build stuff
and you adore me.

1139
00:50:00.767 --> 00:50:02.465
I have to get this veil
to my sister. okay?

1140
00:50:02.534 --> 00:50:03.900
-Okay.
-Oh. hi. aunties!

1141
00:50:03.968 --> 00:50:06.406
-Oh. Oh. Yes. Wait. Margot.
-This must be Kip!

1142
00:50:06.475 --> 00:50:08.607
I'm glad you're here.
Sheila. Rita.

1143
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:12.445
Okay. Just make sure
that the buttons

1144
00:50:12.514 --> 00:50:13.918
are all lined up perfectly.
thank you.

1145
00:50:13.987 --> 00:50:15.150
Thank you.
thank you. thank you.

1146
00:50:15.219 --> 00:50:17.180
-I'm here! I'm here! I'm here!
-Oh!

1147
00:50:17.449 --> 00:50:19.217
You are two hours late!

1148
00:50:19.285 --> 00:50:20.452
Yeah. we got the veil.

1149
00:50:20.521 --> 00:50:23.026
-"We"? Is Kip here?
-Yes. Kip is here.

1150
00:50:23.095 --> 00:50:25.129
-Oh.
-You guys have no faith in me.

1151
00:50:26.061 --> 00:50:27.329
Where are your shoes?

1152
00:50:29.669 --> 00:50:31.294
Um. Fourth Avenue.

1153
00:50:31.363 --> 00:50:32.797
No. no. no. no. no.

1154
00:50:32.866 --> 00:50:35.299
You cannot wear dirty
winter boots down the aisle.

1155
00:50:35.468 --> 00:50:36.900
-Um...
-- Mom?

1156
00:50:36.969 --> 00:50:39.839
Well. you could always wear
your grandmother's shoes.

1157
00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:44.478
-Cute.
-No.

1158
00:50:44.546 --> 00:50:46.182
I knew you were
gonna ruin the wedding.

1159
00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:47.712
I think you are
an absolute disaster!

1160
00:50:47.781 --> 00:50:50.952
Well. you know
what's not a disaster? You.

1161
00:50:51.021 --> 00:50:52.454
Okay? You look amazing.

1162
00:50:52.523 --> 00:50:55.318
And it's fine. I'll find Dana
and wear her shoes.

1163
00:50:55.387 --> 00:50:56.652
Everything will be fine.

1164
00:50:56.721 --> 00:50:59.225
Let's just get
this veil on you.

1165
00:50:59.294 --> 00:51:01.659
Let's get you all situated.

1166
00:51:01.728 --> 00:51:03.594
-Then just...
-- Yeah. I got you.

1167
00:51:03.663 --> 00:51:04.931
-That's right.
-- Here we go.

1168
00:51:06.237 --> 00:51:09.807
Okay. come on.
You look stunning!

1169
00:51:09.876 --> 00:51:11.672
I'm really glad you're here.

1170
00:51:12.074 --> 00:51:13.307
I'm so sorry I was late.

1171
00:51:13.376 --> 00:51:15.112
It was just a debacle.
the whole thing.

1172
00:51:15.181 --> 00:51:17.013
-It's okay. It's okay.
-Evening. ladies.

1173
00:51:17.249 --> 00:51:20.782

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:22.016
I'm Flour.

1175
00:51:22.084 --> 00:51:23.715
Not like the bouquet.

1176
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:25.755
like the grain.

1177
00:51:25.824 --> 00:51:27.587
I'm sorry. are you high?

1178
00:51:27.922 --> 00:51:28.986
Meh.

1179
00:51:29.823 --> 00:51:31.760
-Little bit.

1180
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:33.327
Oh! Maybe a lot.

1181
00:51:33.396 --> 00:51:34.593
-No. no. no.
-It's okay. It's okay.

1182
00:51:34.662 --> 00:51:35.700
-No. no. it's not okay.
-It's all right.

1183
00:51:35.768 --> 00:51:36.793
No. no. I'm freaking out.

1184
00:51:36.862 --> 00:51:38.968
-You want a hit?
-Oh. I'd love one. Thanks.

1185
00:51:39.037 --> 00:51:41.770
After the wedding maybe. Um...

1186
00:51:41.839 --> 00:51:43.099
Cool. cool.

1187
00:51:43.167 --> 00:51:44.976
All right. gonna go find Dana
for those shoes. So...

1188
00:51:45.044 --> 00:51:46.342
-Please.
-Oh. I want to go with you

1189
00:51:46.411 --> 00:51:47.673
because I want to meet
this Kip character.

1190
00:51:47.741 --> 00:51:49.076
No. Mom. please.
there's not enough time and.

1191
00:51:49.144 --> 00:51:50.378
you know. Kip is nervous.

1192
00:51:50.614 --> 00:51:52.342
He doesn't need my whole
family pawing all over him.

1193
00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:53.845
Do you have...?

1194
00:51:53.914 --> 00:51:55.315
Nobody's gonna be pawing
all over him. It's ridiculous.

1195
00:51:55.384 --> 00:51:56.615
- I just...
- Yeah.

1196
00:51:56.684 --> 00:51:57.787
- That doesn't make...
Wait for me.

1197
00:51:57.856 --> 00:51:59.015
Hell. yes. Rita. you can

1198
00:51:59.183 --> 00:52:01.319
knock down a pony wall
without a permit. No problem.

1199
00:52:01.388 --> 00:52:02.755
What about the electrical?

1200
00:52:03.124 --> 00:52:04.359
Just pull it.

1201
00:52:04.661 --> 00:52:06.523
Just take it out. Come on.
Paul. just pull that shit.

1202
00:52:06.592 --> 00:52:07.623
- Isn't that dangerous?

1203
00:52:07.692 --> 00:52:09.100
I mean. yeah. if you're. like.

1204
00:52:09.169 --> 00:52:10.062
standing in a bathtub
or something.

1205
00:52:11.463 --> 00:52:12.764
Oh. man. I love this guy.

1206
00:52:12.833 --> 00:52:15.205
Hey. dude. marry Margot
so we can be bros.

1207
00:52:15.274 --> 00:52:16.335
-- Whoa!
-And you can teach me

1208
00:52:16.404 --> 00:52:17.975
all your moves. right? Hyah!

1209
00:52:18.044 --> 00:52:19.602
Oh. oh. careful.
I'm dangerous.

1210
00:52:19.671 --> 00:52:21.408
You're a martial arts guy too?

1211
00:52:21.477 --> 00:52:24.347
-I mean. I dabble. you know?
-Oh!

1212
00:52:24.415 --> 00:52:25.711
-For the cardio mostly.
-- Dabble?

1213
00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.451
The dude's like
a third-degree black belt.

1214
00:52:27.519 --> 00:52:30.086
Third. fourth. It's like.
who's counting at this point?

1215
00:52:30.155 --> 00:52:31.386
-- Dude!

1216
00:52:31.455 --> 00:52:32.617
- Well. for months.
all I've heard

1217
00:52:32.686 --> 00:52:33.891
is Kip. Kip. Kip.
I want to meet Kip.

1218
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.226
Okay. Mom. you're being crazy.

1219
00:52:35.461 --> 00:52:37.393
-So. tone it down and I'll...
-- Kip is here?

1220
00:52:37.462 --> 00:52:39.763
-Yes. That's him. right there.
-- Uh. Kip.

1221
00:52:39.832 --> 00:52:40.824
Not much to look at

1222
00:52:40.893 --> 00:52:42.098
-but seems nice.
-- Kip. Hey. Kip.

1223
00:52:42.166 --> 00:52:43.759
-Hey. Kip. Kip? Kip.
-Oh.

1224
00:52:43.828 --> 00:52:45.168
-Yeah. hi.
-- That's Kip?

1225
00:52:45.237 --> 00:52:46.434
Yes. that's
Margot's boyfriend. Kip.

1226
00:52:46.769 --> 00:52:47.805
- Yeah. sorry. I wanted
you to meet my mother.

1227
00:52:47.873 --> 00:52:49.403
Um. this is my mom. Judy.

1228
00:52:49.472 --> 00:52:51.000
-Oh. my gosh.
-Dying to meet you.

1229
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:52.735
Hello. I've been dying
to meet you as well.

1230
00:52:52.804 --> 00:52:55.346
-The black belt?
-Uh. I guess.

1231
00:52:55.715 --> 00:52:56.808
Hold my purse.

1232
00:52:57.881 --> 00:52:58.976
Excuse me.

1233
00:52:59.912 --> 00:53:01.878
-How dare you show up here?

1234
00:53:01.947 --> 00:53:05.249
You are a sorry excuse
for a man! Kip!

1235
00:53:05.317 --> 00:53:06.587
I'm sorry.

1236
00:53:06.755 --> 00:53:08.487
Not the reflexes I'd expect
from a black belt.

1237
00:53:08.555 --> 00:53:10.826
Hey. Dana. stop.
This is not Kip.

1238
00:53:11.495 --> 00:53:13.528
- Hmm?
- I mean... I mean...

1239
00:53:13.596 --> 00:53:15.328
this is... this is...
this is not the...

1240
00:53:15.397 --> 00:53:16.629
the Kip you thought he was.

1241
00:53:16.698 --> 00:53:19.566
He's apologized
for doing that thing

1242
00:53:19.635 --> 00:53:21.531
that you're so mad about.
Stop it.

1243
00:53:21.599 --> 00:53:23.170
You mean. dumping you?

1244
00:53:23.239 --> 00:53:25.268
You dumped my daughter?

1245
00:53:25.337 --> 00:53:26.574
Dude!

1246
00:53:27.613 --> 00:53:29.613
I did...

1247
00:53:29.682 --> 00:53:30.575
Uh...

1248
00:53:30.778 --> 00:53:32.980
-Not? I didn't.
-- He... He...

1249
00:53:33.048 --> 00:53:34.518
He didn't.

1250
00:53:34.687 --> 00:53:37.547
See. I... I thought he did.
but it was a misunderstanding.

1251
00:53:37.615 --> 00:53:39.356
Yeah. Happens.

1252
00:53:39.425 --> 00:53:41.488
How can you be confused
about being dumped?

1253
00:53:41.556 --> 00:53:42.990
- Um...
- Ooh...

1254
00:53:43.059 --> 00:53:44.161
Texting. Mother.

1255
00:53:44.229 --> 00:53:45.524
- Oh. yeah.
It was the text.

1256
00:53:45.593 --> 00:53:46.991
-It was a wrong text.
-Yeah.

1257
00:53:47.193 --> 00:53:48.692
- It was an emoji thing.
- Yeah. you got it.

1258
00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.830
Hey! Who's ready
to get married?

1259
00:53:50.899 --> 00:53:53.101
-That's me. Hi. That's me.
-- Oh! Right on.

1260
00:53:55.041 --> 00:53:56.206
Okay. you all saw that. right?

1261
00:53:56.275 --> 00:53:57.907
-- Ooh. poltergeist.

1262
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:03.176
So. are you sure it's okay
that I'm sitting this close?

1263
00:54:03.245 --> 00:54:04.412
Oh. don't be silly.

1264
00:54:04.481 --> 00:54:06.181
-You're practically family.
-Okay.

1265
00:54:08.788 --> 00:54:10.183
Mm. Thanks.

1266
00:54:19.329 --> 00:54:20.991
-Sorry.

1267
00:54:25.403 --> 00:54:26.500
I thought they were

1268
00:54:26.568 --> 00:54:28.372
supposed to wear
matching dresses.

1269
00:55:03.603 --> 00:55:06.206
Oh-ho. that's a good sign.

1270
00:55:06.742 --> 00:55:08.310
-What's happening?
-- Honey. it's okay.

1271
00:55:08.379 --> 00:55:09.574
I'm sure
it's just the weather.

1272
00:55:09.643 --> 00:55:11.540
The lights will be on soon.

1273
00:55:11.609 --> 00:55:12.810
Sorry. folks!

1274
00:55:12.879 --> 00:55:14.485
Lights won't be back
anytime soon.

1275
00:55:14.553 --> 00:55:17.120
-Power lines are freezing up.

1276
00:55:17.189 --> 00:55:18.519
And we just blew a generator.

1277
00:55:18.588 --> 00:55:20.384
- You...
You don't have a backup?

1278
00:55:20.619 --> 00:55:22.588
Uh. this was our backup.

1279
00:55:22.657 --> 00:55:23.855
We've got a team
working on it.

1280
00:55:23.924 --> 00:55:25.494
I just don't know
how long it's gonna take.

1281
00:55:25.563 --> 00:55:28.231
-- Daddy?
-No. not to worry. honey.

1282
00:55:28.633 --> 00:55:31.134
I'll get you to the altar.
It's plenty bright.

1283
00:55:31.203 --> 00:55:32.502
- No. no. no. no. no.

1284
00:55:32.571 --> 00:55:34.269
I can't walk down the aisle
in blue light.

1285
00:55:34.338 --> 00:55:35.932
I'll look like a zombie bride.

1286
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.538
-A beautiful zombie bride.
-Aw.

1287
00:55:38.607 --> 00:55:40.537
Maybe. we can get
some candles?

1288
00:55:40.606 --> 00:55:42.007
You know. just like

1289
00:55:42.076 --> 00:55:43.676
-a few hundred or...
-- That's a great idea.

1290
00:55:43.745 --> 00:55:45.809
Sorry. folks.
Building fire codes.

1291
00:55:46.278 --> 00:55:49.619
We've got an expert builder
right here in the family.

1292
00:55:49.688 --> 00:55:51.849
Kip knows all about
fire codes. Don't you. Kip?

1293
00:55:51.918 --> 00:55:54.525
-Uh...
-Yeah. bro. What can we do?

1294
00:55:54.894 --> 00:55:56.889
Um...

1295
00:55:57.759 --> 00:55:59.390
-How about oranges?
-- Huh?

1296
00:55:59.459 --> 00:56:00.861
Oranges. sir?

1297
00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:02.999
Yeah. I mean. oranges aren't
against code. right?

1298
00:56:03.501 --> 00:56:05.168
-- Huh.
-Where's your kitchen?

1299
00:56:05.237 --> 00:56:06.763
Okay. I need some olive oil.

1300
00:56:06.832 --> 00:56:07.964
a couple of kitchen scissors

1301
00:56:08.033 --> 00:56:09.472
and a couple of mops.
all right?

1302
00:56:09.541 --> 00:56:11.070
You three start
cutting these in half.

1303
00:56:11.139 --> 00:56:13.539
And then. you start helping me
scoop out the flesh. Okay?

1304
00:56:13.608 --> 00:56:15.446
Is this a Clementine thing?

1305
00:56:15.815 --> 00:56:16.809
Actually.

1306
00:56:16.878 --> 00:56:18.381
it's an orange thing.
Just trust me.

1307
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:20.577
You're obsessed
with citrus fruit.

1308
00:56:24.687 --> 00:56:25.884
- No.
we'll save it for later.

1309
00:56:26.286 --> 00:56:28.120
- Get these over to them.
- Do you need more?

1310
00:56:29.023 --> 00:56:31.491
- Grab a new mop.
- Ah. great. thanks.

1311
00:56:31.893 --> 00:56:34.198
- Yeah. Just start
cutting some more wicks.

1312
00:56:34.533 --> 00:56:36.731
- Yeah. right here.
On the top. I'll get it.

1313
00:56:39.263 --> 00:56:40.768
- How do you know
how to do this?

1314
00:56:40.937 --> 00:56:43.172
Well. I once defended
a vegan chef for stalking.

1315
00:56:43.241 --> 00:56:44.440
She was guilty as hell.

1316
00:56:44.509 --> 00:56:45.771
but she taught me
how to make candles.

1317
00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.275
And my spelt muffins
are to die!

1318
00:56:48.343 --> 00:56:49.778
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1319
00:56:49.847 --> 00:56:51.941
-- All right.
-Yeah. try lighting a couple.

1320
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:53.484
-All right.
-Here you go.

1321
00:56:54.779 --> 00:56:56.212
-Hey!

1322
00:56:57.551 --> 00:56:58.581
- This is great!

1323
00:56:58.650 --> 00:56:59.919
- Thanks.

1324
00:57:14.973 --> 00:57:16.540
We did it!

1325
00:57:17.707 --> 00:57:18.971
-- Hey. this guy!
-Congrats!

1326
00:57:19.039 --> 00:57:20.642
- Look at you.
saving the wedding!

1327
00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:22.947
-Wow! Amazing.
-- I'm married!

1328
00:57:31.223 --> 00:57:32.682
-Kip!
-I know!

1329
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:34.323
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1330
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.620
- I know. he's the best.
One second.

1331
00:57:38.189 --> 00:57:39.858
Hi. can we play
the other song?

1332
00:57:39.926 --> 00:57:41.895
The one we talked about?
Thank you.

1333
00:57:42.761 --> 00:57:43.795
I'm gonna come find you.

1334
00:57:43.864 --> 00:57:45.067
-Okay. Yeah.
-Have a drink.

1335
00:57:45.136 --> 00:57:46.163
Have so much fun.

1336
00:57:48.102 --> 00:57:51.306
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1337
00:57:51.374 --> 00:57:53.174
My sister is so happy.

1338
00:57:53.243 --> 00:57:54.375
And. I mean.

1339
00:57:54.443 --> 00:57:55.904
you saved the wedding.

1340
00:57:55.973 --> 00:57:57.644
Oh. no. you're so welcome.

1341
00:57:57.713 --> 00:57:58.978
I mean.
I'm just glad it worked.

1342
00:57:59.046 --> 00:58:00.317
I've never tried that before.

1343
00:58:00.386 --> 00:58:01.380
-Yeah. right.
-No. I'm serious.

1344
00:58:01.449 --> 00:58:02.784
Stop.

1345
00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:07.184
-Well...
-Well...

1346
00:58:11.057 --> 00:58:12.558
It's probably time
for you to go. huh?

1347
00:58:12.626 --> 00:58:14.628
Yeah.

1348
00:58:14.964 --> 00:58:17.166
But we should. uh. toast
the newlyweds. right?

1349
00:58:17.235 --> 00:58:18.227
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1350
00:58:18.429 --> 00:58:19.996
Yeah. I mean. it would be rude
if Kip didn't.

1351
00:58:20.065 --> 00:58:21.405
-Of course. yeah.

1352
00:58:21.641 --> 00:58:23.068
I'm gonna go get
some champagne. Be right back.

1353
00:58:27.673 --> 00:58:30.278
Okay. Mata Hari.

1354
00:58:30.347 --> 00:58:31.880
who's the imposter?

1355
00:58:32.483 --> 00:58:35.311
Just some guy I met tonight.

1356
00:58:36.385 --> 00:58:38.147
Tinder? Hinge?

1357
00:58:38.216 --> 00:58:40.750
-Christian Mingle?
-No! I. uh...

1358
00:58:41.486 --> 00:58:44.221
I walked into my apartment
and he was in my bed.

1359
00:58:45.324 --> 00:58:47.830
-Are you medicated?
-We have the same address.

1360
00:58:47.899 --> 00:58:49.661
You know. I keep a spare key
under the flower pot.

1361
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:51.497
it's a very long story.

1362
00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:56.573
So. this random hot man
appears in your bed

1363
00:58:56.642 --> 00:58:58.406
and agrees to play
your ex-boyfriend

1364
00:58:58.474 --> 00:58:59.973
at your sister's wedding?

1365
00:59:00.905 --> 00:59:02.646
You think he's hot?

1366
00:59:04.683 --> 00:59:06.815
I'm putting out
a spare key tonight.

1367
00:59:07.516 --> 00:59:09.917
Nice to meet you. Kip.

1368
00:59:11.115 --> 00:59:13.421
Hello. Veronica.
Small world.

1369
00:59:13.489 --> 00:59:14.623
You know. it's funny.

1370
00:59:14.825 --> 00:59:17.322
You look just like
a public defender I know.

1371
00:59:17.391 --> 00:59:20.760
But he's about to be engaged
to a redhead mattress model.

1372
00:59:21.063 --> 00:59:23.931
Yeah. I'm. uh. just here
helping out a friend.

1373
00:59:24.667 --> 00:59:26.999
- Oh! Pretty friend.

1374
00:59:27.068 --> 00:59:28.831
Future fiancé
must really trust you.

1375
00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.439
Yeah. actually she does.

1376
00:59:30.508 --> 00:59:32.102
But. um. I would appreciate it

1377
00:59:32.171 --> 00:59:34.572
if you could keep this
between us.

1378
00:59:34.641 --> 00:59:36.609
Yeah. Absolutely.

1379
00:59:37.078 --> 00:59:39.714
- Congratulations.
sister. You did it.

1380
00:59:39.782 --> 00:59:41.877
-Love you. sister.

1381
00:59:41.946 --> 00:59:44.981
And Kip is amazing!

1382
00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:47.387
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

1383
00:59:47.455 --> 00:59:48.658
Thank you.

1384
00:59:48.727 --> 00:59:50.993
Who is that.
that Kip is talking to?

1385
00:59:51.295 --> 00:59:52.691
That's. um...

1386
00:59:52.759 --> 00:59:55.294
It's Brian's Aunty V.

1387
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:58.130
Wait. You gave away
my plus one?

1388
00:59:58.199 --> 00:59:59.836
Yeah. but you weren't
answering your phone

1389
00:59:59.905 --> 01:00:01.337
and I thought that you were
just gonna flake on me

1390
01:00:01.405 --> 01:00:03.135
like you always do. So...

1391
01:00:04.307 --> 01:00:05.334
Nice.

1392
01:00:05.403 --> 01:00:06.906
So. you want us
to share the halibut?

1393
01:00:06.975 --> 01:00:08.877
Yeah. we'll get you
some extra bread.

1394
01:00:09.312 --> 01:00:10.377
That's...

1395
01:00:10.446 --> 01:00:11.947
That's gross.

1396
01:00:14.249 --> 01:00:16.580
You're staying for dinner.
You're staying for dinner.

1397
01:00:16.649 --> 01:00:18.885
I promise it's the last thing
I'll ask of you this evening.

1398
01:00:18.954 --> 01:00:20.288
But you have
to stay for dinner.

1399
01:00:20.357 --> 01:00:21.283
Okay. Okay.

1400
01:00:21.519 --> 01:00:22.787
-Okay. you're gonna stay? Yes?
-Okay. Yeah. no.

1401
01:00:22.855 --> 01:00:23.855
-Yes.
-I beg.

1402
01:00:23.924 --> 01:00:25.329
Yeah. please. just let me...

1403
01:00:25.398 --> 01:00:26.530
Okay. but you're gonna stay?

1404
01:00:26.599 --> 01:00:27.829
-Yes. of course.
-You're gonna stay.

1405
01:00:27.898 --> 01:00:28.994
-Promise? Okay.
-Yeah. just let me...

1406
01:00:29.229 --> 01:00:30.233
Okay. no. okay. but you're
gonna stay. yeah?

1407
01:00:30.302 --> 01:00:31.801
Yeah. Yes. yes. yes.

1408
01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.264
Hey. Clem!

1409
01:00:33.333 --> 01:00:34.735
- <i> Did you just</i>
<i>hang up on me?</i>

1410
01:00:34.804 --> 01:00:36.201
What? No. no. no.
Of course not.

1411
01:00:36.269 --> 01:00:37.773
Sorry. there is just
bad reception here.

1412
01:00:37.842 --> 01:00:39.436
<i>Bad reception?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

1413
01:00:39.505 --> 01:00:42.040
Uh. well. like I said.
I had to make a quick stop.

1414
01:00:42.108 --> 01:00:44.173
and then
I'll explain everything...

1415
01:00:44.242 --> 01:00:46.310
-Hello?

1416
01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.346
-Ooh.

1417
01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:52.951
Hey. sweetie.

1418
01:00:53.019 --> 01:00:55.559
<i>"Sweetie"? It's almost- 00.</i>

1419
01:00:55.628 --> 01:00:56.624
<i>Where the hell are you.</i>
<i>Griffin?</i>

1420
01:00:56.693 --> 01:00:57.825
- Kip? Kip. Kip. Kip.

1421
01:00:58.027 --> 01:00:59.256
-Time for pictures.
-Oh. yeah. Okay. I'll be

1422
01:00:59.325 --> 01:01:00.863
-right over there. Okay. yeah.
-Okay.

1423
01:01:00.931 --> 01:01:03.326
<i>-I'm sorry. Was that a bride?</i>
-Uh. yes.

1424
01:01:03.395 --> 01:01:05.335
<i>Your quick stop</i>
<i>was at a wedding?</i>

1425
01:01:05.403 --> 01:01:06.433
Um...

1426
01:01:06.502 --> 01:01:07.537
Sort of. Yeah.

1427
01:01:07.606 --> 01:01:09.569
<i>Whose wedding? And who is Kip?</i>

1428
01:01:09.638 --> 01:01:12.004
Oh. Uh. me. I'm Kip.

1429
01:01:12.073 --> 01:01:13.436
It's. um...
It's just a nickname.

1430
01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:14.941
<i>I've never heard</i>
<i>anyone call you Kip.</i>

1431
01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:16.344
Really? 'Cause. uh.
back in college...

1432
01:01:16.413 --> 01:01:17.473
- Kip!

1433
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:18.645
...all my law school buddies
was like...

1434
01:01:18.714 --> 01:01:19.914
- Come on! Pictures!

1435
01:01:19.983 --> 01:01:21.284
Yeah. just give me
one second. okay?

1436
01:01:21.353 --> 01:01:22.278
No. no. no. Come...

1437
01:01:22.347 --> 01:01:23.820
Because I have to finish
this call. okay?

1438
01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:25.184
<i>-That was a law school buddy?</i>
-Um...

1439
01:01:25.253 --> 01:01:26.622
<i>And Griffin.</i>
<i>what are you wearing?</i>

1440
01:01:26.691 --> 01:01:27.989
<i>That's not the suit I got you.</i>

1441
01:01:28.158 --> 01:01:29.791
Kip. we gotta talk
manufactured siding at dinner.

1442
01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.124
-Table 14.
-- And we will.

1443
01:01:31.192 --> 01:01:32.693
I promise you.
I'll be right there. Okay?

1444
01:01:32.762 --> 01:01:34.128
Just gotta wrap this up. okay?

1445
01:01:34.196 --> 01:01:35.959
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>are you staying for dinner?</i>

1446
01:01:36.028 --> 01:01:37.996
<i>Griffin. we had a deal.</i>

1447
01:01:38.065 --> 01:01:39.770
Um. yeah. I know.
Listen. Clem.

1448
01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:41.630
This friend is having
a family emergency.

1449
01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:43.301
And they just. they really.
really need my help.

1450
01:01:43.369 --> 01:01:45.370
<i>Is this some kind</i>
<i>of genetic defect?</i>

1451
01:01:45.439 --> 01:01:48.810
<i>You never say no to anyone.</i>
<i>Except for me.</i>

1452
01:01:48.878 --> 01:01:50.809
No. look.
I'm really sorry. okay?

1453
01:01:50.878 --> 01:01:52.278
You're gonna have to go on

1454
01:01:52.347 --> 01:01:53.850
and then I'll meet you there
at the party late...

1455
01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:54.945
-- Kip. Come on.

1456
01:01:55.014 --> 01:01:56.246
We're all waiting for you.

1457
01:01:56.315 --> 01:01:57.916
Oh. you know.
I really don't need

1458
01:01:57.985 --> 01:01:59.117
to be in the wedding pictures.

1459
01:01:59.186 --> 01:02:01.687
Nonsense.
You're practically family.

1460
01:02:01.755 --> 01:02:02.993
I'm really not.

1461
01:02:03.262 --> 01:02:04.394
- Come on.

1462
01:02:07.399 --> 01:02:08.929
Yeah. yeah. that's sweet.

1463
01:02:10.297 --> 01:02:11.833
Oh. Margot.
Kip. Kip. Kip. Come on in.

1464
01:02:11.902 --> 01:02:13.065
-Oh. God. no. he's fine.
-Dude. Dude.

1465
01:02:13.134 --> 01:02:14.398
Do we. like. stick
our tongue out?

1466
01:02:14.466 --> 01:02:15.831
-We're like. "Ahh!"
-Maybe less tongue.

1467
01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:17.438
- <i> Let's do it!</i>

1468
01:02:17.507 --> 01:02:18.703
One. two. three.

1469
01:02:18.772 --> 01:02:19.838
And we jump!

1470
01:02:21.308 --> 01:02:22.677
- <i> I was early.</i>
- <i> Okay.</i>

1471
01:02:22.746 --> 01:02:23.911
I want to pinch your cheeks.

1472
01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:25.178
I just want
to pinch your cheeks.

1473
01:02:26.483 --> 01:02:27.950
One. two...

1474
01:02:28.019 --> 01:02:30.282
-Here we go. One. two. three.

1475
01:02:31.083 --> 01:02:32.548
- <i> Just us. just men.</i>

1476
01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:41.192
Oh. that was so much fun.
you guys.

1477
01:02:41.261 --> 01:02:42.627
-You already got me...
-No. no. No.

1478
01:02:42.696 --> 01:02:44.098
So sweet!

1479
01:02:49.873 --> 01:02:51.071
-Kip.
-Come here. come here.

1480
01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.370
-Jump in.
-Get in the edge. Just there.

1481
01:02:55.078 --> 01:02:57.207
- <i> So. here's</i>
<i>to food poisoning.</i>

1482
01:02:57.376 --> 01:02:59.144
If I hadn't gotten
those bad clams

1483
01:02:59.213 --> 01:03:01.181
and ended up
in the emergency room.

1484
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:04.983
I wouldn't have met
the hottest nurse in town

1485
01:03:05.052 --> 01:03:06.622
when I was at my very worst.

1486
01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:08.721
- Well. he was green.

1487
01:03:09.057 --> 01:03:11.521
-And adorable.

1488
01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:14.629
-To food poisoning and fate!
-- Yeah!

1489
01:03:15.231 --> 01:03:17.962
And thank you to everyone
for coming out tonight.

1490
01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:20.099
It's always been my dream

1491
01:03:20.168 --> 01:03:22.035
to get married
on New Year's Eve.

1492
01:03:22.304 --> 01:03:25.072
And. um. to my parents
for footin' the bill.

1493
01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:27.369
It's coming out
of your inheritance.

1494
01:03:27.438 --> 01:03:29.474
-Dad!
-And to my maid of honor.

1495
01:03:29.776 --> 01:03:30.879
my sister.

1496
01:03:30.947 --> 01:03:33.277
Who will be late
to her own funeral

1497
01:03:33.346 --> 01:03:35.046
but who really
came through for me

1498
01:03:35.115 --> 01:03:36.682
when I needed her the most.

1499
01:03:36.751 --> 01:03:37.987
- Aw.

1500
01:03:39.453 --> 01:03:42.421
And to Kip. who until tonight.
let's face it.

1501
01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:44.824
I don't think any of us
believed you existed.

1502
01:03:44.893 --> 01:03:46.323
-I know.

1503
01:03:46.392 --> 01:03:49.592
But who really saved
the wedding.

1504
01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.298
-Kip. Kip. Kip. Kip.
-Kip. Kip. Kip. Kip.

1505
01:03:52.366 --> 01:03:53.936
-Okay. Oh. stop.
-No. stop. Stop. stop. Okay.

1506
01:03:54.005 --> 01:03:55.901
-- Speech.
-- Kip. Kip. Kip. Kip.

1507
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:57.269
-Speech.
-No. no. no.

1508
01:03:57.338 --> 01:03:59.005
I mean.
I'm just happy I could help.

1509
01:03:59.074 --> 01:04:01.377
I want to hear
how you two met.

1510
01:04:01.446 --> 01:04:02.946
Ah! Me too.

1511
01:04:03.014 --> 01:04:04.845
Ah. no. This is Carrie
and Brian's night.

1512
01:04:04.914 --> 01:04:06.045
You know? It's not about us.

1513
01:04:06.114 --> 01:04:08.677
Yes. to Carrie and Brian!
Whoo!

1514
01:04:08.746 --> 01:04:10.420
-Oh. no. That's okay.
-It's all yours. bro.

1515
01:04:10.489 --> 01:04:11.515
- That's okay.

1516
01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:13.554
All right.

1517
01:04:13.623 --> 01:04:14.851
Okay.

1518
01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:15.956
Okay.

1519
01:04:16.025 --> 01:04:17.723
-How did we meet?
-How we met!

1520
01:04:18.996 --> 01:04:20.860
-Um... Well...

1521
01:04:25.002 --> 01:04:29.236
It was a chilly.
gray October morning.

1522
01:04:30.239 --> 01:04:32.606
And I was taking the ferry
into the city

1523
01:04:32.675 --> 01:04:33.705
to meet a friend.

1524
01:04:33.974 --> 01:04:35.405
when I looked down

1525
01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:40.143
and I see the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen

1526
01:04:40.546 --> 01:04:43.213
in this incredible
carnation pink coat.

1527
01:04:43.282 --> 01:04:44.783
- She wore it tonight.

1528
01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:46.319
It's vintage.

1529
01:04:46.388 --> 01:04:49.421
And I guess you could say
I caught her by surprise.

1530
01:04:50.055 --> 01:04:51.156
Yes.

1531
01:04:51.225 --> 01:04:53.691
And from
that moment on. it's...

1532
01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.498
it's been
a non-stop adventure.

1533
01:04:56.867 --> 01:04:58.868
I've scaled tall buildings.

1534
01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:01.266
I've braved snow
by steed and carriage.

1535
01:05:01.334 --> 01:05:03.501
I built fire
and saved the day.

1536
01:05:06.107 --> 01:05:08.410
When I'm with her. I just...

1537
01:05:09.881 --> 01:05:11.612
...I feel like
I'm a superhero.

1538
01:05:12.381 --> 01:05:15.645
Let's just say that
from the moment we met.

1539
01:05:16.952 --> 01:05:19.055
I felt like I was home.

1540
01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:24.159
So. uh. to Margot!

1541
01:05:24.892 --> 01:05:26.562
- To Margot!

1542
01:05:27.692 --> 01:05:29.125
- Cheers.
- Cheers. cheers.

1543
01:05:29.194 --> 01:05:30.829
Jesus. that was amazing!

1544
01:05:31.198 --> 01:05:32.936
Even if it was all bullshit.

1545
01:05:33.005 --> 01:05:35.368
Most romantic bullshit
I ever heard.

1546
01:05:36.437 --> 01:05:38.067
That was an impressive speech.
Counselor.

1547
01:05:38.136 --> 01:05:39.304
- Mm.

1548
01:05:39.373 --> 01:05:42.308
Thanks. It was
surprisingly effortless.

1549
01:05:42.377 --> 01:05:44.744
-Hmm.
-Don't let this one get away.

1550
01:05:44.813 --> 01:05:46.579
Real subtle. Dad.

1551
01:05:47.248 --> 01:05:50.416
But seriously. thank you.
I owe ya.

1552
01:05:50.852 --> 01:05:52.616
Yeah. you do.

1553
01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:08.971
Did you tell them
to play this?

1554
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.268
No. I didn't. I swear.

1555
01:06:10.336 --> 01:06:12.039
-Come on.
-No.

1556
01:06:12.107 --> 01:06:13.736
-Wow.
-Aw.

1557
01:06:15.145 --> 01:06:17.274
Don't forget
to email me that bid.

1558
01:06:17.343 --> 01:06:19.043
Oh. yeah. You got it. Rita.

1559
01:06:19.512 --> 01:06:21.679
Are you taking side jobs
with my aunts?

1560
01:06:21.748 --> 01:06:24.721
Yeah. well. they're having
some foundation issues.

1561
01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:26.221
-Mm.
-It's complicated.

1562
01:06:26.657 --> 01:06:27.822
Contractor stuff.

1563
01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:29.422
Oh. yeah. yeah. yeah.

1564
01:06:57.952 --> 01:06:59.254
- Margot.

1565
01:06:59.721 --> 01:07:00.756
Kip?

1566
01:07:00.825 --> 01:07:03.225
Kip? I thought he was Kip.

1567
01:07:04.928 --> 01:07:06.195
Well. don't look at me.

1568
01:07:06.263 --> 01:07:07.659
-What are you doing here?
-What do you mean.

1569
01:07:07.728 --> 01:07:09.195
what am I doing here?
I texted you I was coming.

1570
01:07:09.264 --> 01:07:10.595
Okay. I told you
I blocked you.

1571
01:07:10.664 --> 01:07:13.695
My God!
You look so beautiful. I...

1572
01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:15.266
-Okay. okay.
-Listen. no. no. no.

1573
01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:16.634
You ever heard of the saying.

1574
01:07:16.703 --> 01:07:18.139
"You don't know what you have
till it's gone"?

1575
01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.204
Have you ever heard
the saying.

1576
01:07:19.273 --> 01:07:20.539
"Not the time or the place"?

1577
01:07:20.607 --> 01:07:21.878
-I understand that.
-You need to leave.

1578
01:07:21.947 --> 01:07:23.145
-Let me just talk to you.
-Look.

1579
01:07:23.214 --> 01:07:24.681
this is so embarrassing.
You need to go.

1580
01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:26.916
-Sorry.

1581
01:07:26.984 --> 01:07:29.149
Hold on.
Is he wearing my tuxedo?

1582
01:07:29.218 --> 01:07:30.516
-Hey. come on.
-- Margot.

1583
01:07:30.585 --> 01:07:31.479
She already asked you
to leave. all right?

1584
01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:32.681
- Is he wearing my tux?

1585
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:34.287
-You're wearing my tuxedo.
-Yes.

1586
01:07:34.356 --> 01:07:35.519
Have you ever heard
of the saying.

1587
01:07:35.588 --> 01:07:37.127
"Never wear
another man's tuxedo"?

1588
01:07:37.196 --> 01:07:38.689
You know. you've been
touching a lot of things

1589
01:07:38.757 --> 01:07:40.295
-that are not yours.
-- Okay. Okay.

1590
01:07:40.364 --> 01:07:41.459
-Guys. this is... Come on.
-I don't think so.

1591
01:07:41.527 --> 01:07:42.892
- That is a thing.
No. no.

1592
01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.397
-this has nothing to do...
-Margot. it's okay.

1593
01:07:44.599 --> 01:07:45.894
-This is between us. Okay?
-- Let's not.

1594
01:07:45.963 --> 01:07:47.333
You cannot just steal
another man's clothes...

1595
01:07:47.402 --> 01:07:48.565
Don't put your finger
on my chest.

1596
01:07:48.634 --> 01:07:50.107
...steal another man's
girlfriend.

1597
01:07:50.175 --> 01:07:51.371
Don't put your finger
on my chest again.

1598
01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.102
- Or else what?
What you gonna do?

1599
01:07:52.538 --> 01:07:53.869
-All right.

1600
01:07:53.938 --> 01:07:56.443
Are you threatening me
with a deadly weapon?

1601
01:07:57.311 --> 01:07:58.373
-Yes.
-Karate chop!

1602
01:08:01.052 --> 01:08:02.548
-Forgive me. Sensei.
-Kip!

1603
01:08:05.751 --> 01:08:08.023
-What is happening?
-He started it.

1604
01:08:11.828 --> 01:08:12.860
- Kip up!

1605
01:08:13.329 --> 01:08:16.731
Okay. So. you really want
to do this. huh?

1606
01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.466
I guess. Okay.

1607
01:08:19.369 --> 01:08:21.029
She told you
I was a black belt. right?

1608
01:08:21.398 --> 01:08:22.431
Uh. yes. she did.

1609
01:08:23.769 --> 01:08:25.274
Griffin. Griffin.
he's not worth it!

1610
01:08:25.343 --> 01:08:27.741
-- Griffin? Who's Griffin?
-I have no idea.

1611
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:29.377
But the new Kip is hot.

1612
01:08:29.445 --> 01:08:30.778
- Brian. do something!
- Here we go.

1613
01:08:30.846 --> 01:08:31.880
- Oh!

1614
01:08:32.182 --> 01:08:33.783
- Okay.
- Hit him. Kip!

1615
01:08:33.851 --> 01:08:35.848
Uh. Kip number one! Whoo!

1616
01:08:36.150 --> 01:08:37.181
- Really. a shoe?

1617
01:08:40.853 --> 01:08:42.324
-- Oh. shit.
-Are you good?

1618
01:08:42.392 --> 01:08:43.660
Whose shoe is that?
You guys look beautiful.

1619
01:08:47.463 --> 01:08:49.364
-Not the cake.
-Did we mess up the cake?

1620
01:08:50.266 --> 01:08:51.330
-No. we're good.
-Cake's okay.

1621
01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:52.530
-It's okay. It's okay.

1622
01:08:52.732 --> 01:08:54.269
-Thank God. The cake's okay.

1623
01:08:54.338 --> 01:08:56.101
- Guys.
you're two grown men!

1624
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:57.369
-Stop it!
-Oh.

1625
01:08:57.438 --> 01:08:58.635
- You guys.
that's enough!

1626
01:08:58.703 --> 01:09:00.069
-Hold on a sec.
-Yeah. try it.

1627
01:09:01.411 --> 01:09:02.711
-Hey. not bad.
-- Pretty good.

1628
01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:05.914
Did you just rip
my Armani pants?

1629
01:09:05.982 --> 01:09:07.646
You just ripped my groin!

1630
01:09:09.718 --> 01:09:11.413
Kip. we're done. We're done.
you guys. That's enough!

1631
01:09:11.482 --> 01:09:12.917
I think we're done!

1632
01:09:13.286 --> 01:09:14.420
- That's it. Kip.

1633
01:09:14.489 --> 01:09:15.786
-- Go to sleep!
-Kill him!

1634
01:09:15.855 --> 01:09:17.320
- Go to sleep!
Go to sleep. bitch!

1635
01:09:17.389 --> 01:09:18.661
That's not how it works.

1636
01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.759
-- You done?
-Yeah.

1637
01:09:22.828 --> 01:09:24.900
This is like Godzilla
versus Bambi.

1638
01:09:24.968 --> 01:09:26.731
We're done. For sure.

1639
01:09:35.912 --> 01:09:37.614
Cake's safe.

1640
01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:41.482
Is that a ring?

1641
01:09:42.249 --> 01:09:43.784
You're proposing tonight?

1642
01:09:43.853 --> 01:09:44.919
Uh-huh.

1643
01:09:45.122 --> 01:09:46.653
You guys literally just met.

1644
01:09:46.722 --> 01:09:48.719
-Not to me. to his girlfriend.
-- Oh. shit.

1645
01:09:48.788 --> 01:09:50.990
- Kip has
another girlfriend?

1646
01:09:51.059 --> 01:09:52.860
Wow. What a dick!

1647
01:09:52.929 --> 01:09:55.462
Oh. my God!

1648
01:09:55.531 --> 01:09:57.663
You brought a fake date
to my wedding?

1649
01:09:57.732 --> 01:09:59.564
No. no. no. He's...
He's not a fake date.

1650
01:09:59.632 --> 01:10:02.764
He's just...
He's just not Kip.

1651
01:10:03.067 --> 01:10:06.671
Oh. so not-Kip is in all
of our wedding photos!

1652
01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:08.538
-Dude!
-- I'm so sorry. It's...

1653
01:10:08.607 --> 01:10:10.873
I was... I didn't...

1654
01:10:10.942 --> 01:10:13.212
Congratulations. sister.
You really did it.

1655
01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.648
You restored my belief

1656
01:10:14.716 --> 01:10:18.253
in your ability to ruin
absolutely everything.

1657
01:10:18.322 --> 01:10:19.852
I'm so sorry. I didn't...

1658
01:10:19.921 --> 01:10:20.923
Sorry...

1659
01:10:20.991 --> 01:10:22.153
Hold on. Margot! Wait!

1660
01:10:22.222 --> 01:10:23.788
Excuse me. Sorry.

1661
01:10:25.527 --> 01:10:27.594
Margot! Margot.
Margot. I'm sorry.

1662
01:10:27.662 --> 01:10:29.363
Sorry for what?
You didn't do anything.

1663
01:10:29.432 --> 01:10:31.367
-I mean. this is all my fault.
-No.

1664
01:10:31.436 --> 01:10:33.434
Look. I should have told you.
okay? I tried.

1665
01:10:33.503 --> 01:10:34.898
-I tried to tell you.
-Tell me what?

1666
01:10:34.966 --> 01:10:37.466
That you're practically
engaged to a supermodel?

1667
01:10:37.535 --> 01:10:38.736
No. okay.

1668
01:10:39.005 --> 01:10:41.111
-She's just a regular model.
-It doesn't matter!

1669
01:10:41.179 --> 01:10:42.542
I mean.
it's none of my business!

1670
01:10:42.611 --> 01:10:45.010
Carrie's right.
I'm a total disaster.

1671
01:10:45.079 --> 01:10:47.747
I mean. what kind of a crazy
person brings a total stranger

1672
01:10:47.816 --> 01:10:50.080
to one of the biggest days
of their sister's life?

1673
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:52.850
Well. I mean. in all fairness.
we did meet last night.

1674
01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:58.490
Look. I'm sorry
I brought you into this.

1675
01:10:58.559 --> 01:11:00.524
-You're so nice.
-No. I'm not.

1676
01:11:00.593 --> 01:11:02.190
I'm not nice. okay? This...

1677
01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:04.527
Like. what I'm doing here.
this is not nice. okay?

1678
01:11:04.596 --> 01:11:06.402
This is really selfish.

1679
01:11:07.068 --> 01:11:08.137
What?

1680
01:11:08.539 --> 01:11:10.039
I don't know.
When I saw you the other night

1681
01:11:10.108 --> 01:11:11.407
in the parking lot. I just...

1682
01:11:11.609 --> 01:11:14.408
I felt something that I've
never felt before. and I...

1683
01:11:14.477 --> 01:11:15.941
I wanted to wrap
my arms around you.

1684
01:11:16.009 --> 01:11:18.447
and just tell you that
everything was gonna be okay.

1685
01:11:20.177 --> 01:11:23.447
And then 24 hours later.
you needed my help. and...

1686
01:11:23.516 --> 01:11:24.948
I don't know. I just...

1687
01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:27.390
I couldn't say no.

1688
01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:29.619
-- Babe.

1689
01:11:29.688 --> 01:11:31.193
-Oh. God.
-Are you okay?

1690
01:11:31.262 --> 01:11:32.259
-Oh. my God.
-Yeah. I'm...

1691
01:11:32.328 --> 01:11:33.326
What are you still doing here?

1692
01:11:33.395 --> 01:11:34.560
What are you still doing here?

1693
01:11:34.896 --> 01:11:36.663
Dude. it's over. all right?
She doesn't want you here!

1694
01:11:36.731 --> 01:11:37.893
Don't tell me what she wants.
All right?

1695
01:11:37.962 --> 01:11:39.435
-Okay. guys...
-I know she doesn't want

1696
01:11:39.503 --> 01:11:40.699
some asshole
who can't make up his mind.

1697
01:11:40.934 --> 01:11:42.338
-Really? I'm an asshole?
-Okay. you guys! Stop it!

1698
01:11:42.407 --> 01:11:43.102
Aren't you. like.
engaged or something?

1699
01:11:43.171 --> 01:11:44.236
That's enough!

1700
01:11:44.305 --> 01:11:46.343
Griffin is leaving.

1701
01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:49.874
He has somewhere
very important to be.

1702
01:11:51.378 --> 01:11:53.312
Yeah. That's right.

1703
01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.985
I'm leaving. You win.

1704
01:11:56.054 --> 01:11:57.285
-Congrats.
-Hey.

1705
01:11:57.354 --> 01:11:58.885
-What about my tux?
-Kip!

1706
01:11:58.954 --> 01:12:00.884
Do you know how long it took
me to get that tux tailored?

1707
01:12:00.953 --> 01:12:02.355
- Enough.
- Oh. my God!

1708
01:12:02.424 --> 01:12:03.860
I'm so sor... Did you want...

1709
01:12:03.929 --> 01:12:05.021
You want your tux?

1710
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:06.759
Yeah. sorry. you should've
just said that.

1711
01:12:06.828 --> 01:12:08.023
-First thing.
-- Oh! Here we go again.

1712
01:12:08.092 --> 01:12:09.297
-Naked guy!
-- Griffin. stop!

1713
01:12:09.365 --> 01:12:10.631
-- Right on cue.
-$2.200.

1714
01:12:10.699 --> 01:12:11.628
-Okay. stop!
-$3.200. but who's counting?

1715
01:12:11.697 --> 01:12:12.762
Griffin. what are you doing?

1716
01:12:12.831 --> 01:12:14.162
I got to give
him back his tux.

1717
01:12:14.231 --> 01:12:16.132
-It's $2.800.
-Is he taking his clothes off?

1718
01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:18.567
-I swear. he's a nudist.
-This wedding keeps getting

1719
01:12:18.636 --> 01:12:19.803
better and better.

1720
01:12:20.106 --> 01:12:21.409
- It's. like. sticky.
- You can't go outside

1721
01:12:21.644 --> 01:12:22.439
like that!
You're gonna freeze! Stop it!

1722
01:12:22.508 --> 01:12:23.606
Fuck your cufflinks.

1723
01:12:23.675 --> 01:12:24.808
-- Sir?
-What?

1724
01:12:24.877 --> 01:12:26.343
You can't be naked
in the lobby.

1725
01:12:26.412 --> 01:12:28.214
Sorry. Sorry.

1726
01:12:28.283 --> 01:12:29.484
Thank you very much.

1727
01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:30.782
I don't have any cash. but...
Sorry.

1728
01:12:30.851 --> 01:12:33.184
Well. it's been
a little slice of heaven.

1729
01:12:33.386 --> 01:12:34.417
- Yeah.

1730
01:12:34.486 --> 01:12:35.986
Unforgettable.

1731
01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:40.027
I guess I'll just pay
for the dry cleaning.

1732
01:12:40.096 --> 01:12:41.427
Come on.

1733
01:12:41.496 --> 01:12:43.064
Look. why are you even here?

1734
01:12:43.634 --> 01:12:45.662
-I came to see you.
-You broke up with me.

1735
01:12:45.731 --> 01:12:47.767
I know. and I made a mistake.

1736
01:12:47.836 --> 01:12:50.968
Babe. just give us
another chance. Please.

1737
01:12:55.111 --> 01:12:56.578
I need a drink.

1738
01:12:57.443 --> 01:12:58.878
Sorry. my love.

1739
01:13:01.819 --> 01:13:02.646
Damn it!

1740
01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:07.952
Ugh. Shit.

1741
01:13:11.126 --> 01:13:12.528
Fuck.

1742
01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:01.003
Hey. man. It's me again.

1743
01:14:01.072 --> 01:14:02.645
Uh. could you take me
to the bus stop?

1744
01:14:02.713 --> 01:14:04.479
Sure. But it looks like
you forgot somethin'.

1745
01:14:04.548 --> 01:14:06.610
Oh. yeah. The tux.
It wasn't mine.

1746
01:14:06.678 --> 01:14:08.551
Not the tux. The girl.

1747
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:11.213
She wasn't mine either.

1748
01:14:12.816 --> 01:14:13.915
Could've fooled me.

1749
01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:16.823
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah!

1750
01:14:40.013 --> 01:14:43.052
Hey. man.
You forgot your pants.

1751
01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.655
Oh. man! I might do the same!

1752
01:15:10.882 --> 01:15:11.741
Hey.

1753
01:15:12.244 --> 01:15:15.585
I know. yeah.
I'm on the list. Griffin Reed.

1754
01:15:18.222 --> 01:15:19.787
You good? Thank you.

1755
01:15:21.787 --> 01:15:23.552
- His name is Griffin?

1756
01:15:23.621 --> 01:15:24.787
I know.

1757
01:15:24.856 --> 01:15:26.195
- Did you tell him?

1758
01:15:26.263 --> 01:15:27.592
No. I didn't tell him.

1759
01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.194
Wow. Talk about fate.

1760
01:15:29.263 --> 01:15:31.693
It's not fate! I wish people
would stop using that word.

1761
01:15:31.762 --> 01:15:33.494
But you like him.

1762
01:15:33.563 --> 01:15:37.904
So? He's proposing to some
model named Clementine.

1763
01:15:37.973 --> 01:15:40.472
-Oh! Clementine Pratt?
-You know who she is?

1764
01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:42.005
I've seen her Instagram.

1765
01:15:42.073 --> 01:15:45.077
She's got. like.
10.000 followers.

1766
01:15:45.513 --> 01:15:46.781
- She's so pretty.

1767
01:15:46.849 --> 01:15:48.749
- Well.
if he's so in love with her.

1768
01:15:48.818 --> 01:15:50.945
what's he doing
at a wedding with you?

1769
01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:52.281
He's a really nice guy.

1770
01:15:52.349 --> 01:15:53.887
-No one's that nice.
-It doesn't matter!

1771
01:15:53.956 --> 01:15:55.788
He's on his way
to propose to someone else.

1772
01:15:55.856 --> 01:15:57.594
and the real Kip
came back for me.

1773
01:15:57.662 --> 01:15:59.757
so everything worked out
just the way it should.

1774
01:15:59.826 --> 01:16:02.197
Okay? There's your... fate.

1775
01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:05.531
-- Yeah! It was fire!

1776
01:16:05.867 --> 01:16:07.899
- Really?
I wish I was there!

1777
01:16:07.968 --> 01:16:09.337
- Yeah.
you should have come.

1778
01:16:09.405 --> 01:16:10.772
- I'll come next time.

1779
01:16:13.805 --> 01:16:14.871
Better! Appreciate it!

1780
01:16:14.940 --> 01:16:16.742
Wait. do you have my social?

1781
01:16:17.044 --> 01:16:18.942
- Oh. yeah.
Your pictures are so great!

1782
01:16:19.011 --> 01:16:21.013
-- Okay. baby.
-Hi!

1783
01:16:25.086 --> 01:16:28.383
Hi. uh. can I just get
a whiskey neat. please?

1784
01:16:29.724 --> 01:16:31.188
Hey. you're Clem's guy. right?

1785
01:16:32.396 --> 01:16:35.028
-Oh. uh. yeah.
-Grover?

1786
01:16:35.497 --> 01:16:36.727
-Griffin.
-Ah. yes.

1787
01:16:36.796 --> 01:16:39.066
Griffin. the... lifeguard.

1788
01:16:39.735 --> 01:16:41.763
-Lawyer.
-Ah. Good on you. mate.

1789
01:16:41.999 --> 01:16:43.367
-Hi!
-Hey. babe.

1790
01:16:43.636 --> 01:16:44.804
-Hi.
-Hi.

1791
01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.204
Look who decided to show up
to their engagement party.

1792
01:16:47.273 --> 01:16:49.377
What the hell happened to you?
Were you mugged?

1793
01:16:49.445 --> 01:16:50.679
What are you wearing?

1794
01:16:50.748 --> 01:16:52.111
Oh. no. I'm sorry.
Look. my phone died.

1795
01:16:52.179 --> 01:16:54.182
It's just. it's been
a really long night. so...

1796
01:16:54.251 --> 01:16:55.177
Yeah. For me.

1797
01:16:55.379 --> 01:16:56.851
Do you know how embarrassing
it is to show up

1798
01:16:56.919 --> 01:16:58.186
to your own
New Year's Eve party alone?

1799
01:16:58.255 --> 01:16:59.214
I know. I'm...

1800
01:16:59.283 --> 01:17:00.521
I had sponsors
waiting for our arrival!

1801
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:01.789
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1802
01:17:01.858 --> 01:17:02.950
And what am I supposed
to tell Zara?

1803
01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.527
-I don't know. I...
-You know what?

1804
01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:08.289
It doesn't matter.
I will smooth it up with Zara

1805
01:17:08.358 --> 01:17:11.195
and you can wear them
for the wedding.

1806
01:17:11.795 --> 01:17:12.827
Okay.

1807
01:17:13.396 --> 01:17:14.665
Don't worry.
Everything's all set.

1808
01:17:14.734 --> 01:17:15.935
-Okay?
-Okay.

1809
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:20.637
Please give it up for
the fabulous Clementine Pratt!

1810
01:17:23.043 --> 01:17:26.813
Thank you! Thank you.
My goodness.

1811
01:17:26.882 --> 01:17:29.210
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna sing.

1812
01:17:29.279 --> 01:17:30.984
But I just wanted
to thank James

1813
01:17:31.053 --> 01:17:34.383
for hosting
this incredible party tonight!

1814
01:17:35.053 --> 01:17:36.352
I don't know about you all.

1815
01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.526
but I have a feeling
this is going to be

1816
01:17:38.595 --> 01:17:41.461
the best New Year's Eve ever.

1817
01:17:43.196 --> 01:17:45.834
Babe.
I think you're on.

1818
01:17:47.238 --> 01:17:48.331
- Okay!

1819
01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.398
-Who's ready for the bouquet?
-- Hey.

1820
01:17:50.467 --> 01:17:51.671
- Okay.
on the count of three.

1821
01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:52.737
-Ready?
-- Okay!

1822
01:17:52.805 --> 01:17:54.103
- Three. two...

1823
01:17:54.172 --> 01:17:55.509
- One!
No. I'm just kidding.

1824
01:17:55.578 --> 01:17:56.674
-What?
-Just one second

1825
01:17:56.743 --> 01:17:57.910
before you guys do that.

1826
01:17:58.213 --> 01:17:59.481
This is my favorite part
of the wedding. by the way.

1827
01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:00.916
But I just have to do this.

1828
01:18:00.984 --> 01:18:02.780
-What the hell?
-- I really appreciate it.

1829
01:18:02.848 --> 01:18:04.081
Would you guys just mind?

1830
01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:06.622
Many of you guys
don't know me. okay?

1831
01:18:06.691 --> 01:18:09.887
But. uh. I am Kip.
The real Kip.

1832
01:18:09.956 --> 01:18:11.892
And I just want to apologize

1833
01:18:11.961 --> 01:18:13.594
for what happened
with the imposter Kip.

1834
01:18:13.663 --> 01:18:14.795
I kinda liked the imposter.

1835
01:18:14.864 --> 01:18:16.464
And I don't want
to steal the thunder

1836
01:18:16.532 --> 01:18:18.026
from the beautiful bride.

1837
01:18:18.095 --> 01:18:19.161
-Oh. no.
-- Yes.

1838
01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:20.394
We wouldn't want
to do that. No.

1839
01:18:20.463 --> 01:18:21.535
-- This has to be done.
-Right.

1840
01:18:21.604 --> 01:18:23.036
This is very important.

1841
01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:28.136
Okay.

1842
01:18:31.644 --> 01:18:33.849
Oh. shit.

1843
01:18:40.725 --> 01:18:42.150
You know.
whenever I imagined myself

1844
01:18:42.219 --> 01:18:44.024
proposing to my future wife.

1845
01:18:45.225 --> 01:18:47.623
I always knew
it would only happen once.

1846
01:18:47.692 --> 01:18:50.798
When I imagined the man
of my dreams proposing to me.

1847
01:18:50.867 --> 01:18:53.931
I wanted it to be
once in a lifetime.

1848
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.232
And I'd never give that moment

1849
01:18:55.301 --> 01:18:58.137
to someone
who I had any doubts about.

1850
01:18:58.904 --> 01:19:00.341
Twenty-four hours ago.

1851
01:19:01.043 --> 01:19:04.009
all I wanted was for you
to ask me to marry you.

1852
01:19:04.077 --> 01:19:05.408
<i>Twenty-four hours ago.</i>

1853
01:19:05.477 --> 01:19:07.409
I'd convinced myself
that you were the woman

1854
01:19:07.478 --> 01:19:10.285
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with.

1855
01:19:14.754 --> 01:19:16.124
But that's...

1856
01:19:16.193 --> 01:19:17.321
Changed.

1857
01:19:19.894 --> 01:19:21.356
-- Um...
-What?

1858
01:19:21.425 --> 01:19:23.998
I... I thought
this is what you wanted.

1859
01:19:24.067 --> 01:19:26.368
-I can't. I can't do this.
-- What?

1860
01:19:26.437 --> 01:19:28.032
I can't let you do this.

1861
01:19:28.101 --> 01:19:29.966
I'm really sorry.
I... I can't.

1862
01:19:30.035 --> 01:19:32.072
-What?
-I'm sorry.

1863
01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.877
-Come on. Get up.

1864
01:19:36.309 --> 01:19:38.172
Happy New Year. everyone!
Ha-ha-ha-ha. Here.

1865
01:19:38.241 --> 01:19:40.113
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

1866
01:19:52.524 --> 01:19:54.930
Just... Just stop
for just a second. All right?

1867
01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:57.592
I know that I'm embarrassing
myself. but...

1868
01:19:59.001 --> 01:20:01.232
I treated you terribly
last night.

1869
01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:02.764
-And I am sorry. Last night...
-Yeah.

1870
01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:05.337
The truth is. I have spent
the last 24 hours thinking

1871
01:20:05.406 --> 01:20:08.141
that I've been making the
biggest mistake of my life.

1872
01:20:09.011 --> 01:20:12.780
I... actually think
that I love you.

1873
01:20:12.849 --> 01:20:15.483
and I...
I do want to marry you.

1874
01:20:15.719 --> 01:20:19.147
You "think"? What.

1875
01:20:19.215 --> 01:20:20.950
are you... are you crazy?

1876
01:20:21.019 --> 01:20:22.352
You don't love me.

1877
01:20:22.421 --> 01:20:26.256
And you know what? I...
I don't love you.

1878
01:20:26.325 --> 01:20:27.862
I mean.
I had more fun tonight.

1879
01:20:27.931 --> 01:20:29.998
a more honest.
genuine connection

1880
01:20:30.067 --> 01:20:31.632
with a total stranger
than I've had with you

1881
01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:32.899
in the last three months!

1882
01:20:32.967 --> 01:20:34.767
Wow. Kick a guy
while he's down.

1883
01:20:34.835 --> 01:20:36.834
I'm just being honest.

1884
01:20:36.903 --> 01:20:38.268
You know it's true.

1885
01:20:38.336 --> 01:20:40.910
And you'll bounce back.
I'm sure.

1886
01:20:41.676 --> 01:20:43.078
Goodbye. okay?

1887
01:20:43.146 --> 01:20:46.311
For real this time. please.

1888
01:20:47.218 --> 01:20:48.280
Goodbye.

1889
01:21:01.828 --> 01:21:03.526
Oh. my God.

1890
01:21:12.035 --> 01:21:13.503
Okay...

1891
01:21:29.659 --> 01:21:31.158
Ted. are you hungry?

1892
01:21:33.228 --> 01:21:37.197
-Hey. buddy. Happy New Year.

1893
01:21:38.832 --> 01:21:40.431
Yum. yum. yum.

1894
01:21:40.834 --> 01:21:42.235
Good night. pal.

1895
01:21:47.611 --> 01:21:48.736
- Wow. okay.

1896
01:21:48.805 --> 01:21:50.738
So you're just sneaking out
of my wedding?

1897
01:21:50.807 --> 01:21:53.776
I was going more
for graceful exit.

1898
01:21:54.012 --> 01:21:55.949
Oh. okay. Right.

1899
01:21:56.018 --> 01:21:58.914
Just. uh.
quick question first.

1900
01:21:59.483 --> 01:22:01.889
-Why do you hate me?
-Hate you?

1901
01:22:01.957 --> 01:22:04.052
-Yeah.
-I don't hate you.

1902
01:22:04.121 --> 01:22:05.355
I worship you.

1903
01:22:05.424 --> 01:22:07.630
-Okay. Come on.
-What? It's true!

1904
01:22:07.699 --> 01:22:08.898
I wish I were more like you.

1905
01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:11.165
I mean. you're brave.
You're smart.

1906
01:22:11.233 --> 01:22:13.302
Everywhere we go.
everybody just adores you.

1907
01:22:13.371 --> 01:22:15.801
I mean. you're marrying the
best guy in the world tonight.

1908
01:22:17.707 --> 01:22:19.202
Your life is perfect.

1909
01:22:19.271 --> 01:22:21.872
You think my life is perfect?

1910
01:22:21.941 --> 01:22:23.310
Are you crazy?

1911
01:22:23.378 --> 01:22:25.878
No. the only difference
between me and you is

1912
01:22:25.946 --> 01:22:28.017
I go for what I want.

1913
01:22:28.786 --> 01:22:30.481
And you're too afraid to try.

1914
01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:34.089
So. stop trying to be me.

1915
01:22:35.185 --> 01:22:36.686
Just go be you.

1916
01:22:37.389 --> 01:22:39.523
-You're right.

1917
01:22:40.389 --> 01:22:42.461
Thank you.

1918
01:22:42.697 --> 01:22:43.557
Yeah.

1919
01:22:43.626 --> 01:22:45.699
I'm sorry
I ruined your wedding.

1920
01:22:45.768 --> 01:22:47.566
No. Hey. it's fine.

1921
01:22:47.634 --> 01:22:50.098
You know. Brian said that
the fight already went viral.

1922
01:22:54.304 --> 01:22:56.111
I love you. sister.

1923
01:22:57.044 --> 01:22:59.114
I love you too.

1924
01:23:04.117 --> 01:23:05.549
-Hmm.

1925
01:23:06.451 --> 01:23:08.089
- Ten! Nine!
- Oh!

1926
01:23:08.158 --> 01:23:09.320
- Eight! Seven!
- Um...

1927
01:23:09.523 --> 01:23:10.718
-- Go. Go.
-Yeah. okay. But don't forget

1928
01:23:10.787 --> 01:23:11.989
-brunch tomorrow.
-- Six! Five! Four!

1929
01:23:12.058 --> 01:23:13.259
-Okay.
-Yeah?

1930
01:23:13.328 --> 01:23:18.194
- Three! Two! One!
Happy New Year!

1931
01:24:17.428 --> 01:24:18.787
Hi. Ted.

1932
01:24:30.835 --> 01:24:33.604
I love what you've done
with my apartment.

1933
01:24:38.681 --> 01:24:39.775
Margot?

1934
01:24:40.877 --> 01:24:43.315
I rang the bell.
like. a thousand times.

1935
01:24:43.384 --> 01:24:44.818
but you didn't answer.
so I just...

1936
01:24:44.887 --> 01:24:45.983
I don't have a bell.

1937
01:24:46.319 --> 01:24:48.883
Oh. I wonder what that was.

1938
01:24:50.052 --> 01:24:53.158
Wait. hold on. So. what...
what are you doing here?

1939
01:24:53.227 --> 01:24:54.692
Uh. you left this at my house.

1940
01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.464
I thought it might be
important. Legal stuff.

1941
01:24:59.197 --> 01:25:01.368
Yeah. Thank you.

1942
01:25:07.439 --> 01:25:09.537
-You're alone.
-Um. yeah.

1943
01:25:09.606 --> 01:25:12.148
And not engaged.

1944
01:25:12.981 --> 01:25:14.442
-And...
-No...

1945
01:25:14.511 --> 01:25:16.713
Wait. How did you know?

1946
01:25:17.247 --> 01:25:18.412
Instagram.

1947
01:25:18.681 --> 01:25:20.717
Ah. right. Yeah.

1948
01:25:23.757 --> 01:25:26.259
Wait. hold on. So. you came
all the way over here

1949
01:25:26.328 --> 01:25:29.726
at- 00 a.m.
just to return my bag?

1950
01:25:31.063 --> 01:25:32.161
Yeah.

1951
01:25:32.697 --> 01:25:34.566
Well. and to show you
something.

1952
01:25:35.335 --> 01:25:36.766
You want to show me something?

1953
01:25:37.574 --> 01:25:38.636
Yes.

1954
01:25:43.911 --> 01:25:45.247
Unzip.

1955
01:25:46.343 --> 01:25:47.682
Is this a trap?

1956
01:25:48.018 --> 01:25:49.381
-No!
-Okay.

1957
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:51.385
-Just do it!
-All right. All right.

1958
01:25:58.362 --> 01:26:00.959
The stupid things
we do in college. right?

1959
01:26:02.765 --> 01:26:03.859
Um...

1960
01:26:04.966 --> 01:26:06.400
That's a...

1961
01:26:07.268 --> 01:26:08.663
-- A griffin.
-What...

1962
01:26:08.732 --> 01:26:10.737
I have a griffin tattoo.

1963
01:26:11.039 --> 01:26:12.307
You got that in college?

1964
01:26:13.677 --> 01:26:14.537
Yeah.

1965
01:26:14.806 --> 01:26:16.878
I had just broken up
with my boyfriend.

1966
01:26:16.946 --> 01:26:19.246
I was a little drunk.

1967
01:26:19.315 --> 01:26:21.916
And I told the guy
to surprise me.

1968
01:26:21.985 --> 01:26:24.682
So... surprise!

1969
01:26:32.461 --> 01:26:34.089
Oh. thank God.
it's not a Tweety Bird.

1970
01:26:40.804 --> 01:26:41.901
This is insane.

1971
01:26:42.437 --> 01:26:43.798
You have a griffin
on your body.

1972
01:26:43.867 --> 01:26:45.206
If you have "Margot"
on your ass.

1973
01:26:45.275 --> 01:26:46.835
I really am calling
the police.

1974
01:26:46.904 --> 01:26:48.904
Oh. not yet.
but that's a good idea.

1975
01:26:54.516 --> 01:26:56.016
Are you fucking kidding me?

1976
01:26:56.084 --> 01:26:57.313
Oh. shit! Clementine!

1977
01:26:57.382 --> 01:26:58.583
What are you doing here?

1978
01:26:58.652 --> 01:27:00.019
You didn't even call
to check on me.

1979
01:27:00.088 --> 01:27:01.686
What... We broke up.

1980
01:27:02.222 --> 01:27:03.491
I want my Sonicare.

1981
01:27:03.727 --> 01:27:04.552
What?

1982
01:27:04.621 --> 01:27:06.053
My Sonicare toothbrush.

1983
01:27:06.122 --> 01:27:08.429
I actually had to pay
for that. I want it back.

1984
01:27:09.164 --> 01:27:10.594
-Now?
-Yes. now!

1985
01:27:10.663 --> 01:27:12.627
Before you rub it
all over your mouth.

1986
01:27:12.696 --> 01:27:14.134
or clean your toilet with it.

1987
01:27:14.203 --> 01:27:15.764
Or let someone else use it.

1988
01:27:15.833 --> 01:27:17.870
Yeah. okay. all right.
Just one second.

1989
01:27:17.939 --> 01:27:18.967
Thanks.

1990
01:27:21.811 --> 01:27:22.876
Wait.

1991
01:27:22.945 --> 01:27:24.076
I know you.

1992
01:27:24.411 --> 01:27:26.744
Are you the girl
from Bennigan's?

1993
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:28.446
Yes.

1994
01:27:28.882 --> 01:27:31.386
-You stole my Uber.
-So. you stole my boyfriend?

1995
01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:35.222
No. Not... Not really.
Not... Not on purpose.

1996
01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.288
How long has this
been going on?

1997
01:27:36.357 --> 01:27:39.092
Minutes! Seconds. Not long.

1998
01:27:39.161 --> 01:27:40.327
What kind of person steals

1999
01:27:40.396 --> 01:27:42.029
someone's boyfriend
on New Year's Eve?

2000
01:27:42.098 --> 01:27:43.592
I didn't mean to. I swear.

2001
01:27:43.661 --> 01:27:45.162
I think this is everything.

2002
01:27:45.231 --> 01:27:46.264
I need a bag!

2003
01:27:46.332 --> 01:27:47.900
Bag. yes. One second.

2004
01:27:48.336 --> 01:27:49.401
Did you know he was supposed

2005
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:50.868
to ask me
to marry him tonight?

2006
01:27:51.204 --> 01:27:52.933
Um. was he?

2007
01:27:53.002 --> 01:27:54.641
It was so humiliating.

2008
01:27:54.710 --> 01:27:57.411
He basically dumped me
in front of the whole party.

2009
01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:00.948
Some people even got it
on video.

2010
01:28:01.017 --> 01:28:03.849
I'm sorry. Tissue?

2011
01:28:04.418 --> 01:28:07.686
-Thanks.
-That's... That's awful.

2012
01:28:09.553 --> 01:28:11.688
I've seen your Instagram.

2013
01:28:11.757 --> 01:28:13.420
Your pictures
are really pretty.

2014
01:28:13.489 --> 01:28:14.793
Thanks.

2015
01:28:16.559 --> 01:28:18.031
It's Facetune.

2016
01:28:18.199 --> 01:28:19.593
Oh. That's a good app.

2017
01:28:19.662 --> 01:28:21.633
Okay. I have a bag.

2018
01:28:21.702 --> 01:28:23.937
She doesn't need a bag!
She needs a hug!

2019
01:28:24.006 --> 01:28:25.235
And more tissues!

2020
01:28:25.404 --> 01:28:27.038
Seriously?

2021
01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.674
-Griffin!
-Okay.

2022
01:28:30.974 --> 01:28:33.111
You do seem
like a nice person.

2023
01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:34.878
I'm trying to be.

2024
01:28:37.151 --> 01:28:39.388
Oh. no. Okay.

2025
01:28:41.086 --> 01:28:43.923
You know. I really hope you
don't wake up tomorrow

2026
01:28:43.992 --> 01:28:47.555
and realize there was never
anything real between you two.

2027
01:28:47.624 --> 01:28:48.989
And that you just ruined

2028
01:28:49.058 --> 01:28:50.962
the entire course
of all of our lives

2029
01:28:51.031 --> 01:28:56.001
for some meaningless. romantic
New Year's Eve fantasy.

2030
01:28:59.071 --> 01:29:01.008
- Okay. so. it looks
like we're out of Kleenex.

2031
01:29:01.077 --> 01:29:02.477
but I found some TP.

2032
01:29:03.342 --> 01:29:04.710
I have to go.

2033
01:29:05.645 --> 01:29:08.778
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm really sorry.

2034
01:29:08.847 --> 01:29:10.246
Wait. Margot.
where are you going?

2035
01:29:10.315 --> 01:29:11.552
Margot?

2036
01:29:13.418 --> 01:29:14.687
What did you do?

2037
01:29:16.224 --> 01:29:18.086
-Nothing.

2038
01:29:19.889 --> 01:29:21.155
All right. take your stuff.

2039
01:29:28.267 --> 01:29:29.570
Margot?

2040
01:29:30.435 --> 01:29:31.500
Margot. wait.

2041
01:29:31.569 --> 01:29:32.940
What just happened?

2042
01:29:33.009 --> 01:29:34.135
I can't do this.

2043
01:29:34.204 --> 01:29:36.176
I can't be responsible
for ruining your life

2044
01:29:36.245 --> 01:29:37.610
like I do everyone else's.

2045
01:29:37.679 --> 01:29:39.841
Oh. you're not ruining
anything. Okay?

2046
01:29:40.077 --> 01:29:42.443
Listen. Margot.
I'm crazy about you.

2047
01:29:42.812 --> 01:29:44.416
You don't even know me.

2048
01:29:44.485 --> 01:29:45.750
I mean. a couple hours ago.

2049
01:29:45.819 --> 01:29:48.019
you were gonna propose
to somebody else.

2050
01:29:48.088 --> 01:29:50.922
Yeah. and it would've been
the worst mistake of my life.

2051
01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:53.021
Come on. 15 Maple Drive?

2052
01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:55.430
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>
Your tattoo?

2053
01:29:55.499 --> 01:29:57.263
That's got to mean something.
right?

2054
01:29:57.331 --> 01:29:58.663
You know this is fate.

2055
01:29:58.732 --> 01:30:01.200
I am so tired
of everyone saying

2056
01:30:01.269 --> 01:30:02.703
that everything is fate.

2057
01:30:02.771 --> 01:30:05.204
Okay. who doesn't love
<i>Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>

2058
01:30:05.272 --> 01:30:06.372
15 Maple Drive?

2059
01:30:06.441 --> 01:30:07.573
I'm sure if you googled it.

2060
01:30:07.642 --> 01:30:09.003
there are thousands
of results.

2061
01:30:09.072 --> 01:30:11.072
You could've woken up
in anyone's bed.

2062
01:30:11.141 --> 01:30:13.915
Yeah. but I woke up in yours.
Okay?

2063
01:30:13.984 --> 01:30:15.076
So. call it fate.

2064
01:30:15.145 --> 01:30:17.044
or dumb luck. or chance.
or whatever it is.

2065
01:30:17.113 --> 01:30:19.153
but I still get to choose.
okay?

2066
01:30:19.221 --> 01:30:21.188
And I... I choose you.

2067
01:30:21.256 --> 01:30:23.987
And... And I choose...

2068
01:30:25.054 --> 01:30:27.595
I choose to do
the right thing.

2069
01:30:28.631 --> 01:30:31.463
Maybe fate
is that girl waiting for you

2070
01:30:31.532 --> 01:30:32.529
in your apartment right now.

2071
01:30:32.598 --> 01:30:34.162
You don't believe that.

2072
01:30:34.497 --> 01:30:35.565
Come on.

2073
01:30:35.834 --> 01:30:38.134
Thank you
for helping me tonight.

2074
01:30:38.636 --> 01:30:40.638
I mean. you really are

2075
01:30:40.707 --> 01:30:42.940
the nicest human
I've ever met.

2076
01:30:43.009 --> 01:30:46.279
And before you say it.
"nice" isn't a bad thing.

2077
01:30:46.615 --> 01:30:50.145
It's a great thing.
It's a rare thing.

2078
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:53.489
So. don't ever stop.

2079
01:30:55.292 --> 01:30:57.152
Wait. Margot. please. just...

2080
01:30:59.597 --> 01:31:01.492
You know. when the universe
gives you a gift.

2081
01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:03.059
you don't just say no.

2082
01:31:14.408 --> 01:31:16.072
Happy New Year. Griffin.

2083
01:31:52.015 --> 01:31:53.615
Oh. shit.

2084
01:31:55.116 --> 01:31:57.146
Oh. God.

2085
01:32:23.278 --> 01:32:24.309
Hey!

2086
01:32:24.378 --> 01:32:25.845
Oh. there he is!

2087
01:32:25.913 --> 01:32:28.208
Happy New Year. everybody.
Hello. hello!

2088
01:32:28.277 --> 01:32:30.011
Honey. what happened
to your face?

2089
01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.817
Oh. it's fine. it's fine.
I just...

2090
01:32:31.886 --> 01:32:34.848
Yeah. last night.
I ran into a fist.

2091
01:32:34.917 --> 01:32:36.151
-Fist?
-Yeah.

2092
01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:37.490
Well. you should see
the other guy.

2093
01:32:37.559 --> 01:32:38.687
- Yeah. right?

2094
01:32:38.756 --> 01:32:40.222
So. where is Clementine?

2095
01:32:40.291 --> 01:32:41.862
Yeah. yeah.
where's this gorgeous fiancée

2096
01:32:41.930 --> 01:32:43.427
your mother keeps showing me
on Instacart. huh?

2097
01:32:43.496 --> 01:32:44.765
Instacart! Um...

2098
01:32:44.833 --> 01:32:47.033
She's. uh. actually
not gonna make it today.

2099
01:32:47.102 --> 01:32:49.369
What happened? Oh. she didn't
get your cold. did she?

2100
01:32:49.437 --> 01:32:50.665
No. she's fine. actually.

2101
01:32:50.734 --> 01:32:52.674
Um. yeah...

2102
01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.844
It's actually just...
It's not gonna work out.

2103
01:32:57.912 --> 01:32:59.874
Yeah. I'm sorry
to disappoint you guys.

2104
01:32:59.943 --> 01:33:01.243
Oh. disappoint who? Us?

2105
01:33:01.445 --> 01:33:03.982
Yeah. I know. December 30th
is like your special day.

2106
01:33:04.051 --> 01:33:05.550
-and I kind of blew it.
-- Hell. son...

2107
01:33:05.618 --> 01:33:07.181
Son. it's just a day.

2108
01:33:07.249 --> 01:33:09.157
I mean.
you'll find your own day.

2109
01:33:09.226 --> 01:33:10.290
And your own girl.

2110
01:33:10.358 --> 01:33:11.756
Oh. I love you.

2111
01:33:11.825 --> 01:33:13.561
-I love you more.

2112
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:15.024
Okay. I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

2113
01:33:15.093 --> 01:33:16.290
-I'll be right back.
-- All right.

2114
01:33:16.359 --> 01:33:17.497
-We'll be right here.
-Okay? All right.

2115
01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.910
Okay.

2116
01:33:51.068 --> 01:33:52.165
Dude!

2117
01:33:52.234 --> 01:33:53.261
What?

2118
01:33:53.597 --> 01:33:55.163
- Hey. Kip's here.
- Oh. my God.

2119
01:33:55.232 --> 01:33:56.705
- What are
you doing here?

2120
01:33:58.602 --> 01:33:59.873
Wow.
