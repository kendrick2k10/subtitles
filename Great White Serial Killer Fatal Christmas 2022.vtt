Was it an accident?

6
00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:27.643
Was it mistaken identity?

7
00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:34.045
Or was the shark actually
hunting its victim?

8
00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:39.126
What will the investigation
reveal about the massive great white

9
00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:43.126
stalking the waters
of the California coast?

10
00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:45.247
We have a fatal attack on a surfer.

11
00:00:45.327 --> 00:00:48.928
He was essentially bit in half.
Boom. boom. boom.

12
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.728
Will the evidence help ID
a prime suspect?

13
00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:53.968
KEITH: There's no way
that shark's under 18ft.

Reveal it's M.O? It did appear to me
that I was dealing
with multiple bites.

15
00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.370
And identify a brand-new hunting
ground for the great white?

16
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.291
We might be able to identify
the exact shark

17

..off Central California.

22

Now. after nine years without
a fatal attack in these waters.

23
00:01:35.656 --> 00:01:38.656
a predator has resurfaced.

This time at nearby Morro Bay...

25
00:01:44.498 --> 00:01:47.618
..on Christmas Eve. 2021.

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:52.339
Can Ralph and Brandon
identify the killer

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.341

in this quiet seaside town?

This is The Pit.

31
00:02:22.945 --> 00:02:25.505
There have been several
shark attacks here in the past

32
00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:28.146
and plenty...

33
00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:30.946
..of terrifying near misses.

has ever happened before.

A sad start to Christmas tonight.
a young man was found dead.

37
00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.550
Today. a man died of an apparent
attack here in Morro Bay

38
00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.070
north of The Pit Beach
on State Park's property.

39
00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:56.071
First responders arrived on scene
and declared the man dead
on the beach.

Beach goers will not
be allowed in the water.

that this incident

42
00:03:01.191 --> 00:03:02.992
happened close to home.

by what appears to have been...

..a massive great white shark.

00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:33.638
Since the attack.

48
00:03:33.717 --> 00:03:35.478
a pall hangs over this town.

49
00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:38.439
leaving locals to wonder.

50
00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.078

Ralph begins his investigation
with the harbor master

when the victim was recovered.

53
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:55.842
Has there ever been anything
that even closely resembles
what you saw here?

54
00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:59.682
It's the first failed shark attack
we've had since I've been here.

55
00:03:59.762 --> 00:04:03.203
The last fatal
attack in Morro Bay was 1957

56
00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:06.883
and claimed the life
of a 25-year-old college student

57
00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:08.804
from Brooklyn. New York.

58
00:04:08.884 --> 00:04:13.205
Since then. five other victims
survived shark bites
in these waters.

59
00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:19.406
Tomas Butterfield wasn't so lucky.

61
00:04:23.087 --> 00:04:26.007
ERIC: Once we arrived on scene
and realised what had occurred.

62
00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:30.327
we got the rest of the people
out of the water that were nearby.

63
00:04:30.408 --> 00:04:32.408
We closed the beach for 72 hours.

64
00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:34.849
and then we kept warning signs
up for the week

65
00:04:34.928 --> 00:04:37.969
because it was Christmas vacation
time and people were around.

66
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.609
Everybody thinks about when
they go out in the water now.

67
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.691
There were no known witnesses
to the Tomas Butterfield attack.

68
00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:54.413
no one to identify the shark.

69
00:04:54.492 --> 00:04:56.132
or see how it happened.

70
00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:01.773
But there may be clues
yet to be uncovered

71
00:05:02.774 --> 00:05:04.934
which has led Brandon to Morro Bay.

72
00:05:06.655 --> 00:05:10.015
and this couple.
Ben and Rebecca Frimmer.

73
00:05:11.135 --> 00:05:13.496
who were in the water that day.

74
00:05:13.576 --> 00:05:16.136
What they saw still haunts them.

75
00:05:17.136 --> 00:05:20.976
So. take me back to Christmas Eve.
The conditions weren't that good
that day.

76
00:05:21.057 --> 00:05:22.978
but you just had
to go surfing anyway.

77
00:05:23.057 --> 00:05:24.937
Yeah. No. they really
weren't that good.

78
00:05:25.018 --> 00:05:27.058
It was windy and kind of nasty.

79
00:05:27.138 --> 00:05:29.059
So even though the conditions
were crappy.

80
00:05:29.138 --> 00:05:31.058
it was some time in the water.

81
00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.899
and we just figured we'd head out
for just a little while.

82
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.301
In the rough conditions.
the couple became separated.

83
00:05:47.462 --> 00:05:49.622
Rebecca decided to head in.

84
00:05:50.982 --> 00:05:54.063
So you were paddling in
and you saw a body board
sticking straight up

85
00:05:54.143 --> 00:05:55.783
with no rider.

86
00:05:55.863 --> 00:05:57.624
At that point. what did you think?

87
00:05:57.704 --> 00:05:59.344
I was. um...

88
00:06:02.144 --> 00:06:03.825
Hang on a second. (CLEARS THROAT)

89
00:06:08.065 --> 00:06:11.586
As I was paddling in I saw a board.
like. floating on top of the water.

90
00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:16.827
So I figured I would go
just pull it out.

91
00:06:16.907 --> 00:06:19.228
so it didn't just become
more trash in the ocean.

92
00:06:23.109 --> 00:06:25.829
I started pulling on the board.
I could feel it was heavy.

93
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:30.430
It wasn't until I could hop off
my board and see

94
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.590
what was going on that I realised
that there was a person there.

95
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.831
As I started pulling
the board in. that became apparent.

96
00:06:41.552 --> 00:06:45.632
BRANDON: You made the discovery.
did you think it was a shark attack?

97
00:06:45.712 --> 00:06:47.833
When I first found Tom.

98
00:06:47.913 --> 00:06:50.633
you know. he was... he was floating
on his stomach.

99
00:06:50.714 --> 00:06:56.195
and so. I couldn't see the excessive
nature of the wounds on his chest

100
00:06:56.274 --> 00:06:57.875
until I pulled him in.

101
00:06:57.954 --> 00:06:59.555
(SIREN WAILS)

102
00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:01.515
Seeing all the commotion
on the beach.

103
00:07:01.595 --> 00:07:04.716
Rebecca's husband Ben
swam back to shore to help.

104
00:07:06.196 --> 00:07:08.437
You know. I've been
a paramedic and combat medic.

105
00:07:08.517 --> 00:07:11.277
so I figured maybe I can help
this guy or something.

106
00:07:11.357 --> 00:07:13.118
So we went over
to kind of investigate

107
00:07:13.197 --> 00:07:15.597
and talk with the harbor
patrol at that point.

108
00:07:15.678 --> 00:07:22.359
and it pretty clear when I saw Tom
that he'd been long deceased.

109
00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:27.200
Maybe it hits harder just because
you don't usually see humans

110
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.880
being eaten. you know.

111
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:34.601
Maybe just hits home more
cos I'm a surfer
and it's our greatest fear.

112
00:07:34.681 --> 00:07:37.282
Maybe everybody's greatest
fear. you know.

113
00:07:37.362 --> 00:07:39.922
Um. it was a pretty sizable bite.

114
00:07:48.564 --> 00:07:51.885
I think Tom's death was instant.

115
00:07:51.964 --> 00:07:54.405
I don't even know
if he knew what was happening.

116
00:07:54.485 --> 00:08:00.126
It looked like he was essentially
almost bit in half.

117
00:08:00.206 --> 00:08:04.287
I mean. he must have bled out
within seconds.

118
00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:20.769
I'm in awe of the shark.
of their power.

119
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.210
They're faster. They're bigger.

120
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:26.931
They have much better senses
than us.

121
00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:30.011
One bite. and that's it.

122
00:08:31.652 --> 00:08:33.532
And I don't even think
you get a warning.

123
00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:36.773
I think they go so fast
and they're so stealthy.

124
00:08:36.852 --> 00:08:38.493
they attack from. like. under him.

125
00:08:40.013 --> 00:08:41.653
It's devastating what they can do.

126

RALPH: Christmas Eve.
Brandon.

127
00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:53.256
there were several internet
cameras filming surfing
conditions in Morro Bay.

128
00:08:53.335 --> 00:08:56.776
Oh. really? I've gone
through hundreds of hours of video

129
00:08:56.856 --> 00:08:59.457
and I have not been able
to find Tomas anywhere.

130
00:09:00.777 --> 00:09:03.017
So. are we at a dead end?

131
00:09:03.098 --> 00:09:05.818
No. we've actually got
some good forensic evidence.

132
00:09:05.898 --> 00:09:09.978
This is the bodyboard Tomas
was riding when he was attacked.

133
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.260
No bites. At first glance.

134
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.701
But take a look at this.

135
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:23.382
Yeah. those are definitely teeth.

136
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:28.702
These are posterior teeth
from the back of the lower jaw
of a white shark.

137
00:09:28.782 --> 00:09:31.502
There's a tooth fragment
embedded in the board.

138
00:09:31.582 --> 00:09:33.223
Wow. look at that.

139
00:09:34.423 --> 00:09:36.063
Look at this.

140
00:09:39.624 --> 00:09:41.265
Wow.

141
00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:46.546
White sharks often leave tooth
fragments behind in cases like this.

142
00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:50.026
So I guess we know what species
this is. Yes. (CHUCKLES)

143
00:09:50.106 --> 00:09:53.267
This was a massive
great white shark.

144
00:09:53.346 --> 00:09:55.987
OK. So how big?

145
00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:59.587
One way to find out is to get ahold
of Tomas Butterfield's wetsuit.

146
00:09:59.668 --> 00:10:02.308
There must be multiple
bites in the wetsuit.

147
00:10:02.388 --> 00:10:04.989
and I can use that to determine
the size of the shark

148
00:10:05.068 --> 00:10:06.709
down to a foot or two.

149
00:10:06.789 --> 00:10:08.629
So. if we know the size
of the shark...

150
00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:11.390
If we know the size
of the shark that killed Tomas.

151
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.430
and if it matches the size
of a previously tagged shark

152
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:17.791
by researchers
off the California coast.

153
00:10:18.791 --> 00:10:23.552
we might be able to identify
the exact shark that killed
Tomas Butterfield.

154

A tragic shark attack at Morro Bay.
California.

42-year-old Tomas Butterfield.
an experienced surfer.

157
00:10:41.115 --> 00:10:44.756
was killed by what's believed
to be a massive great white.

158
00:10:45.876 --> 00:10:49.677
the first fatal attack
off Morro Bay in over 60 years.

159
00:10:50.677 --> 00:10:53.437
The killing has reignited
a decade-long investigation

160
00:10:53.518 --> 00:10:56.038
of great white attacks
in this region.

..who's been helping Ralph gather
data in the field.

164
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.601
Previously. they studied
a series of attacks
off Surf Beach. California.

165
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:12.721
about 50 miles south of Morro Bay.

166
00:11:13.961 --> 00:11:16.842
Those attacks occurred
with clockwork precision

167
00:11:16.922 --> 00:11:19.482
in October of even-numbered years...

168
00:11:21.763 --> 00:11:27.404
..in 2008. 2010. 2012. and 2014.

169
00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:33.325
coinciding with the migration
pattern of large female
great whites.

She's starting to fight now.

00:11:38.886 --> 00:11:41.767
Now. the pattern
seems to be shifting north.

172
00:11:41.846 --> 00:11:44.607
and Brandon is determined
to find out why.

173
00:11:46.007 --> 00:11:48.527
Keith Poe has spent
the last 28 years...

174
00:11:48.608 --> 00:11:50.768
Watch her. She will kill you.
I'm not kidding.

175
00:11:50.848 --> 00:11:53.249
..tagging over 5.000 sharks
for researchers.

176
00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:56.489
For the past decade.

177
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:58.330
he's specialised in great whites.

178
00:11:59.369 --> 00:12:00.970
And lately...

179
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:02.770
Let her go. We've got it. (CHUCKLES)

180
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.811
..he's focused
a lot of his tagging efforts

181
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.771
in the waters off Point Conception
to Morro Bay.

182
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:11.732
This is a relatively new
hot spot for great whites.

183
00:12:12.852 --> 00:12:15.773
A few years ago. you discovered
a new white shark hot spot

184
00:12:15.853 --> 00:12:17.493
off Central California.

185
00:12:17.573 --> 00:12:19.173
Tell me about that.

186
00:12:19.253 --> 00:12:21.014
Well. there were some attacks there.

187
00:12:21.093 --> 00:12:22.894
and. uh. we were interested in that.

188
00:12:23.894 --> 00:12:26.935
We've got a guy that just got hit
by a great white shark.

189
00:12:27.015 --> 00:12:30.015
I was hearing things like
the attacks on the kayaks up there.

190
00:12:30.095 --> 00:12:32.176
MAN: Those are holes
from a great white shark.

191
00:12:32.256 --> 00:12:34.096
Look at the size of that jaw!

192
00:12:34.176 --> 00:12:36.216
(BLEEP)

193
00:12:36.296 --> 00:12:38.857
I thought there would be sharks.
She's coming around.

194
00:12:38.937 --> 00:12:40.537
Here we go. Keith.
There you go.

195
00:12:40.617 --> 00:12:44.058
So I started working that area
and we found sharks up there.

196
00:12:46.138 --> 00:12:47.738
Is there a certain time of the year

197
00:12:47.818 --> 00:12:51.019
that you personally
would not go in the water
near Morro Bay?

198
00:12:51.099 --> 00:12:53.739
I see the most sharks
in. uh. October and November.

199
00:12:53.819 --> 00:12:55.540
but they start coming in
in September.

200
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.260
But they're here year round.

201
00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.901
And they don't leave.

202
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:03.541
So there's no time that's safe.

203
00:13:03.622 --> 00:13:06.142
but there are times
that are a lot less dangerous.

204
00:13:07.462 --> 00:13:11.543
Is Morro Bay a serial killer's
new hunting ground?

205
00:13:14.423 --> 00:13:16.544
Back in San Luis. Obispo.

206
00:13:16.623 --> 00:13:20.504
Ralph continues his investigation
into the Tomas Butterfield case.

207
00:13:20.584 --> 00:13:23.185
questioning one of the first
responders on the scene.

208
00:13:24.185 --> 00:13:27.305
William Miller. a detective
with the coroner's office.

209
00:13:27.386 --> 00:13:29.066
I believe you recovered a wetsuit.

210
00:13:29.146 --> 00:13:31.266
Yeah. I had him transported
in the wetsuit.

211
00:13:31.346 --> 00:13:33.267
and then I removed it
during examination

212
00:13:33.347 --> 00:13:34.947
and I retained it for further use.

213
00:13:35.027 --> 00:13:37.427
Is it possible
to take a look at that? Absolutely.

214
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.271
Then. uh. boom boom. boom. Mm-hm.

215
00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:59.632
You can see from here to here
where the tooth entered.

216
00:13:59.711 --> 00:14:01.752
the insertion.
and from here to here.

217
00:14:03.112 --> 00:14:05.632
And this is the intermediate tooth.

218
00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:08.393
Multiple bites to this individual.

219
00:14:08.473 --> 00:14:12.313
It appears that there's a bite
in the shoulder area.

220
00:14:12.394 --> 00:14:16.194
And. of course. massive trauma
to the. uh. the abdomen.

221
00:14:16.274 --> 00:14:20.275
So this shark when it was moving
through the environment

222
00:14:20.355 --> 00:14:23.396
saw this fuzzy outline.
no definitive shape.

223
00:14:23.475 --> 00:14:26.476
thought it might be food.
and a reflexive response.

224
00:14:27.596 --> 00:14:29.997
Went up to get it
and continued to bite.

225
00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:32.477
and I think that's what
happened here.

226
00:14:32.558 --> 00:14:34.358
and then just swam off.

227
00:14:34.438 --> 00:14:37.518
With your permission. I'd like
to take this wetsuit back to my lab

228
00:14:37.599 --> 00:14:41.239
where I can do a more thorough
examination of the bite impressions.

229
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.759
Yeah. Not only yes.
but I think it's appropriate.

230
00:14:49.201 --> 00:14:52.561
So. Ralph. I've been thinking a lot
about where the bite marks are

231
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:55.962
on the bodyboard and why the bite
impressions are right here

232
00:14:56.042 --> 00:14:57.682
in the corner.

233
00:14:57.762 --> 00:14:59.402
The way the bite mark

234
00:14:59.482 --> 00:15:02.283
was on his body. there will be
an impression right here.

235
00:15:02.362 --> 00:15:05.444
That's correct. What I really think
is he was waiting for a wave.

236
00:15:05.524 --> 00:15:10.364
Now bodyboarders will often sit
on the body board like this.

237
00:15:10.445 --> 00:15:12.725
which makes a perfect impression.

238
00:15:12.805 --> 00:15:15.685
The bite comes from this angle
right here.

239
00:15:15.766 --> 00:15:19.366
His head was hit.
Half his body this way.

240
00:15:19.446 --> 00:15:21.926
I believe he was sitting
like this on the board waiting

241
00:15:22.007 --> 00:15:23.767
for a wave as he got hit.

242
00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:27.087
Interesting. That would explain
the bites to the web suit.

243
00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:28.807
Speaking of which...

244
00:15:31.008 --> 00:15:32.648
Oh. my God.

245
00:15:33.688 --> 00:15:35.329
This is his wetsuit. huh?
Yeah.

246
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.810
These are multiple bites
from a very large shark.

247
00:15:47.531 --> 00:15:49.891
So what kind of attack do you think
this was?

248
00:15:49.972 --> 00:15:53.532
It appears that the initial strike
might have been predatory.

249
00:15:53.612 --> 00:15:57.093
but the additional bites
might not have been predatory

250
00:15:57.173 --> 00:15:58.973
because there was no tissue removed.

251
00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:05.575
So it seems like a lot of shark
attacks is just a single bite.

252
00:16:05.654 --> 00:16:07.295
and the shark swims off.

253
00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:09.335
Clearly not this one. No.

254
00:16:09.415 --> 00:16:12.216
I mean. I was able to determine
the size of the shark

255
00:16:12.296 --> 00:16:14.536
based on the distance
between the teeth.

256
00:16:14.616 --> 00:16:17.417
These are individual
insertion points of teeth.

257
00:16:18.417 --> 00:16:22.057
and measuring the distance between
these individual tooth impressions

258
00:16:22.137 --> 00:16:24.658
will allow us to determine
the size of the shark.

259
00:16:24.738 --> 00:16:28.378
This is a very accurate method
for determining size.

260
00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:30.219
OK. So...

261
00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:33.900
This white shark
was 17 to 18ft in length.

262
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.701
There can't be too many
sharks out there this size. No.

263
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:41.101
And that would definitely
narrow down

264
00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:42.941
the list of suspects. Yes.

265
00:16:48.702 --> 00:16:50.863
MAN: Let us pray.

266
00:16:51.863 --> 00:16:53.583
Back in Morro Bay.

267
00:16:53.663 --> 00:16:57.784
a grieving family and dozens
of friends mourn Tomas Butterfield.

268
00:16:57.864 --> 00:17:00.984
and what would have been
his 42nd birthday.

269
00:17:09.186 --> 00:17:12.026
We grew up in Pittsburgh.
California. right on the Delta.

270
00:17:12.106 --> 00:17:14.707
and we were always on the water.

271
00:17:14.787 --> 00:17:16.828
We were always together.

272
00:17:16.907 --> 00:17:21.348
Our mom growing up was
a single parent.
but going to nursing school.

273
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:24.589
and I remember her telling
a person that. uh.

274
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:26.269
"I was gonna go have an adventure.

275
00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.230
and I'm taking
these two boys with me."

276
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.510
and then move to Ketchikan. Alaska.
where we camped for two months.

277
00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:37.071
So our clothes smelt like campfire

278
00:17:37.152 --> 00:17:39.151
and we walked
into this new high school.

279
00:17:39.231 --> 00:17:43.072
and there's the two stinky
Butterfield kids over there
smelling like smoke.

280
00:17:44.353 --> 00:17:45.993
But our Alaska adventure

281
00:17:46.073 --> 00:17:48.713
was how we fell in love
more and more with the ocean.

282
00:17:49.713 --> 00:17:53.194
Just being in the water
all the time.

283
00:17:53.274 --> 00:17:55.434
And when Tom wasn't surfing
he was snorkeling.

284
00:17:55.514 --> 00:17:59.035
spearfishing. doing everything
ocean related.

285
00:18:02.356 --> 00:18:04.756
When the boy's
mother settled in Morro Bay.

286
00:18:04.836 --> 00:18:07.116
Tom became a regular visitor.

287
00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:10.557
MARIE: He said. "Mom.
I'm so glad you moved here."

288
00:18:12.038 --> 00:18:14.958
He enjoyed going out
on the boogie board

289
00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.039
and getting out in the waves.

290
00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:23.279
I think it made him feel free.

291
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.000
And every time he was out there.

292
00:18:25.079 --> 00:18:27.720
he went way out there.
way out there.

293
00:18:27.801 --> 00:18:31.361
I would be wondering
where in the world he was.

294
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:33.561
and then eventually
I would pick him out.

295
00:18:33.641 --> 00:18:35.281
"Oh. yeah. there's Tom."

296
00:18:36.962 --> 00:18:39.482
As idyllic as Morro Bay might seem.

297
00:18:39.563 --> 00:18:42.923
the locals know what lurks
just offshore.

298
00:18:47.164 --> 00:18:49.964
I remember in July.
he came back and he was.

299
00:18:50.044 --> 00:18:51.845
"Oh. I saw the biggest
shark out there."

300
00:18:51.925 --> 00:18:55.406
or. "I saw this dorsal fin."
I knew it was the shark out there.

301
00:18:55.485 --> 00:18:58.646
And I remember asking. "Tom.
did you get out of the water?"

302
00:18:58.726 --> 00:19:01.047
He said. "No.
I didn't get out of the water.

303
00:19:01.126 --> 00:19:04.447
I know what I'm doing.
I won't go towards it or anything."

304
00:19:04.527 --> 00:19:06.167
There's always notices on there.

305
00:19:06.247 --> 00:19:09.528
a shark was seen. the date.
the time. and everything.

306
00:19:09.608 --> 00:19:12.248
That didn't deter Tom
from anything. He loved it.

307
00:19:15.129 --> 00:19:19.690
Little did he know.
it was on a collision course
with a mammoth predator.

308
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:24.771
BEN: Tom and I were both
coming down here to see
our mom for Christmas Eve.

309
00:19:24.851 --> 00:19:28.532
and Tom. first thing was. "I can't
wait to get back in the water.

310
00:19:30.372 --> 00:19:32.612
It looked good." and I remember him
saying that.

311
00:19:32.692 --> 00:19:34.332
"It looked good."

312
00:19:35.932 --> 00:19:39.173
That morning. I said.
"Tom. it was raining
the night before.

313
00:19:39.253 --> 00:19:40.894
It's kind of not -"

314
00:19:40.973 --> 00:19:44.694
He said. "That's the best time
to go. Mom."

315
00:19:44.774 --> 00:19:47.654
so I can still see him walking out.

316
00:19:50.055 --> 00:19:54.136
And for the last three years.
every time he came out to visit me.

317
00:19:54.217 --> 00:19:57.537
off to the beach he would go
and I would go with him.

318
00:19:57.616 --> 00:19:59.858
That one last time
I didn't go with him.

319
00:19:59.937 --> 00:20:04.498
Tom left. off he went
to go ride the waves.

320
00:20:07.299 --> 00:20:12.139
It was the last time Tomas's mom
would see him alive.

321
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.500
Usually. he takes a long time.

322
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.620
but it was getting around
four o'clock.

323
00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.661
I started calling his phone
and no answer.

324
00:20:20.741 --> 00:20:23.741
(MOBILE VIBRATES) And we drove where
I thought he would be at

325
00:20:23.822 --> 00:20:26.102
and all of the parking was empty.

326
00:20:27.462 --> 00:20:30.743
And then they had flashing light
and it said. "Shark fatality."

327
00:20:30.823 --> 00:20:33.223
And I called his phone
one more time.

328
00:20:33.303 --> 00:20:35.744
The detective answered it...
(MOBILE RINGS)

329
00:20:35.824 --> 00:20:37.464
..and told me about Tom.

330
00:20:37.544 --> 00:20:39.624
Tom was gone. so...

331
00:20:41.345 --> 00:20:43.666
Yeah. it was pretty crazy.

332
00:20:43.745 --> 00:20:47.866
We lived in shock
for about six days.

333
00:20:48.866 --> 00:20:50.827
It's just indescribable.

334
00:20:51.826 --> 00:20:53.867
I mean. you have
to tell yourself to breathe.

335
00:20:57.068 --> 00:21:01.028
Right when that big
shark took a bite of Tom.

336
00:21:01.108 --> 00:21:02.749
Tom became a spirit.

337
00:21:02.829 --> 00:21:05.789
and he turned around.
embraced the shark and said.

338
00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:08.630
"I forgive you."
and he's off. he's off.

339
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.471
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
(ALL CLAPPING)

340
00:21:17.431 --> 00:21:19.512
February 20th was his birthday.

341
00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:22.512
Our friends from Alaska
all came down

342
00:21:22.592 --> 00:21:26.433
and all our friends and family.
tons of people from Morro Bay.

343
00:21:26.513 --> 00:21:28.753
Tom would have been
so pumped to see that.

344
00:21:30.474 --> 00:21:32.074
As part of the ceremony.

345
00:21:32.154 --> 00:21:34.394
Tom's ashes are cast into the ocean.

346
00:21:36.154 --> 00:21:37.795
It was wonderful. amazing.

347
00:21:37.875 --> 00:21:41.156
all those people who came
and had stories about Tom.

348
00:21:41.235 --> 00:21:44.036
And Tom's spirit was there.

349
00:21:45.597 --> 00:21:48.877
I've always thought about my brother
every single day of my life.

350
00:21:48.957 --> 00:21:52.038
and I'll continue to. uh.
think about him.

351
00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:14.642
Tomas Butterfield was the second
fatal shark attack off California

352
00:22:14.722 --> 00:22:16.362
in 18 months.

353
00:22:17.762 --> 00:22:19.362
In that same period.

354
00:22:19.442 --> 00:22:23.083
there have been a dozen clashes
between humans and great whites

355
00:22:23.163 --> 00:22:24.804
off the West Coast.

356
00:22:27.724 --> 00:22:31.325
Some experts speculate
that a white shark population boom

357
00:22:31.405 --> 00:22:33.045
is behind the spike of attacks.

358
00:22:34.085 --> 00:22:37.686
Others contend
that the population may have
changed its migratory routes

359
00:22:37.766 --> 00:22:39.406
due to climate change.

360
00:22:40.606 --> 00:22:42.247
But one thing is certain.

361
00:22:43.287 --> 00:22:47.688
these predators are being seen
more often and in more places

362
00:22:47.768 --> 00:22:49.408
than ever before.

363
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:05.971
Eric Mailander is a drone pilot
based out of Santa Cruz. California.

364
00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:09.931
Today. he's taking his boat through
one of the densest concentrations

365
00:23:10.012 --> 00:23:12.493
of great whites
on the Pacific coast.

366
00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:16.773
A place known as Shark Park.

367
00:23:20.214 --> 00:23:23.574
Drone deployed.
About seven years ago.

368
00:23:23.655 --> 00:23:28.415
juvenile and subadult white sharks
started showing up in mass

369
00:23:28.495 --> 00:23:30.616
to this protected cove.

370
00:23:30.695 --> 00:23:34.136
Right off some of California's most
popular beaches.

371
00:23:36.936 --> 00:23:39.377
One flight. when I do
the census counts.

372
00:23:39.457 --> 00:23:42.858
I counted over 30 within
a mile area.

373
00:23:42.938 --> 00:23:47.219
It's not uncommon to see 20.
but an average would be seven.

374
00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:50.499
eight. nine sharks. That would be
an average day.

375
00:23:50.579 --> 00:23:53.820
Of course. it's a concern to
the people using the water kayakers.

376
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.500
Stand up paddle boarders. swimmers.

377
00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.061
Sheer numbers and how close they are
to the shore and how close they are

378
00:24:01.141 --> 00:24:03.341
to people.

379
00:24:03.421 --> 00:24:06.302
They're actually sometimes
in the surf.

380
00:24:10.022 --> 00:24:13.023
Now typically they're in 18
to 25 feet of water.

381
00:24:13.104 --> 00:24:15.663
They're just doing their thing
swimming at the surface.

382
00:24:15.744 --> 00:24:17.624
not bothering anybody.

383
00:24:17.704 --> 00:24:20.345
At least not on a regular basis.

384
00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:24.386
But there have been run ins
including a fatal bite

385
00:24:24.465 --> 00:24:27.626
on a popular local surfer
in May of 2020.

386
00:24:29.106 --> 00:24:33.587
The day of the attack. I was here.
and I filmed 15 white sharks.

387
00:24:36.388 --> 00:24:41.708
At the center of Shark Park lies
the wreckage of
100 year old cement ship.

388
00:24:42.949 --> 00:24:46.950
An ominous reminder that
these waters can be deadly.

389
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:50.990
Since 2016. 2017.
sort of well known.

390
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.071
And they're actually people swimming
out to the sharks.

391
00:24:54.151 --> 00:24:56.191
which definitely makes me nervous.

392
00:24:58.191 --> 00:25:01.672
People with the inner tubes kicking
their way out to where
the sharks are.

393
00:25:05.153 --> 00:25:06.873
I wouldn't recommend that.

394
00:25:06.953 --> 00:25:11.394
The juveniles aren't typically going
to bite something your size.

395
00:25:11.474 --> 00:25:14.114
but big ones do cruise through here.

396
00:25:14.194 --> 00:25:16.675
And you always need to be aware
of that. Larger sharks

397
00:25:16.754 --> 00:25:19.715
will cruise through. hoping to eat
one of these smaller sharks.

398
00:25:23.036 --> 00:25:25.597
We had a fatality in 2020.

399
00:25:28.117 --> 00:25:31.077
These are sharks.
relatively well behaved.

400
00:25:31.157 --> 00:25:34.158
Again. I think most people
are surprised in seeing how common

401
00:25:34.238 --> 00:25:37.279
they are in certain areas
that there aren't more accidents

402
00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:38.999
and injuries.

403
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.080
Sean Van Sommeran
is the Santa Cruz Bay

404
00:25:48.161 --> 00:25:52.602
shark naturalist who's documented
the surge in sharks here.

405
00:25:52.681 --> 00:25:56.642
I don't look at it as a population
increase or explosion

406
00:25:56.722 --> 00:26:00.122
or a comeback necessarily
so much as the centre of gravity

407
00:26:00.203 --> 00:26:01.843
has shifted north.

408
00:26:04.283 --> 00:26:09.124
Juvenile great whites. which once
grew up in the warm waters
off Mexico

409
00:26:09.204 --> 00:26:13.846
have moved north to the once
chilly waters of Shark Park.

410
00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:19.086
My estimation is that
the sea conditions changed.

411
00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:22.247
You know. the currents have shifted.
And when the conditions change.

412
00:26:22.327 --> 00:26:25.367
it becomes inviting and the sharks
will move in keeping with

413
00:26:25.447 --> 00:26:28.088
those conditions.
It's a perfect scenario

414
00:26:28.167 --> 00:26:30.448
for a white shark rookery.

415
00:26:30.528 --> 00:26:34.729
So their food's here. they're safe.
and they can relax.

416
00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:38.410
Sometimes you're belly full.
We don't see a lot
of feeding activity.

417
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:42.210
And so I suspect that
they come here to rest.

418
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:44.851
digest their food.
have a quick snack

419
00:26:44.931 --> 00:26:47.171
on some of these smaller sharks
and rays.

420
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:49.531
It's just a comfortable
inviting area for them

421
00:26:49.612 --> 00:26:52.092
with fewer predators
and an abundance

422
00:26:52.172 --> 00:26:54.132
of easier to catch food.

423
00:26:54.213 --> 00:26:57.973
The juveniles have simply moved
north into areas

424
00:26:58.053 --> 00:27:00.014
where they weren't previously seen.

425
00:27:00.093 --> 00:27:02.894
And so someone can say.
"Oh. I've lived here for 10 years

426
00:27:02.974 --> 00:27:05.335
and I've never seen so many sharks."

427
00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:08.215
The population must be increasing.

428
00:27:10.335 --> 00:27:11.975
Locally. yes.

429
00:27:12.056 --> 00:27:15.577
But that doesn't indicate
an overall population expansion

430
00:27:15.657 --> 00:27:18.017
or increase in abundance.

431
00:27:23.858 --> 00:27:27.979
More great whites moving into
the waters of popular beaches

432
00:27:28.059 --> 00:27:30.819
is now a fact of life
for Californians.

433
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.019
Ralph and Brandon believe
a better awareness

434
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.061
of what's happening here
may save lives.

435
00:27:40.541 --> 00:27:44.142
And an understanding that
the sharks' behaviour

436
00:27:44.222 --> 00:27:48.903
especially where and when they like
to hunt is crucial for anyone

437
00:27:48.982 --> 00:27:50.943
who enters these waters.

438
00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:55.544
Just as in Morro Bay
where Tomas was killed.

439
00:27:55.624 --> 00:27:58.624
a new great white hot spot
seems to be developing

440
00:27:58.704 --> 00:28:01.465
about 50 miles north
of San Francisco

441
00:28:01.545 --> 00:28:03.385
at a place called Salmon Creek.

442
00:28:04.586 --> 00:28:06.465
On October 3rd. 2021.

443
00:28:07.466 --> 00:28:09.226
a 38-year-old surfer was bitten

444
00:28:09.306 --> 00:28:12.267
and held under water
for nearly 15 seconds.

445
00:28:13.267 --> 00:28:15.428
the seventh attack at this location.

446
00:28:22.188 --> 00:28:25.189
Is this the future
of Morro Bay as well?

447
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:30.110
Brandon has come to Salmon Creek
to interview the victim.

448
00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:31.830
So. a few months ago.

449
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.991
You were hit by a white shark
in these waters.

450
00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:36.991
Tell me what you remember
about that day.

451
00:28:37.991 --> 00:28:40.191
ERIC: I was about 20 minutes
into the session.

452
00:28:41.552 --> 00:28:43.953
and the water
was crystal clear and cold.

453
00:28:44.953 --> 00:28:47.113
And then. bam.
something just hit me.

454
00:28:48.353 --> 00:28:49.994
and it dragged me under.

455
00:28:55.595 --> 00:28:58.715
I had no idea what it was.
I thought a boat hit me.

456
00:28:58.795 --> 00:29:02.116
I'm under water and I feel this
heavy pressure on my leg.

457
00:29:02.196 --> 00:29:03.836
I push as hard as I can.

458
00:29:03.916 --> 00:29:05.677
and nothing. doesn't move.

459
00:29:05.756 --> 00:29:07.797
You know. I can't get away from it.

460
00:29:07.877 --> 00:29:09.517
and I started to kind of panic.

461
00:29:09.597 --> 00:29:11.238
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

462
00:29:12.998 --> 00:29:14.638
It's holding me under water.

463
00:29:17.399 --> 00:29:21.279
So your leg was basically
hanging off right here

464
00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:23.480
and he just got you
right in the dead centre.

465
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.240
Yeah. right behind my knee.

466
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.881
then he came back and sandwiched me
between the board.

467
00:29:28.961 --> 00:29:30.601
and that's what I'm saving my leg.

468
00:29:30.681 --> 00:29:32.682
was this back side
of the board right here.

469
00:29:33.722 --> 00:29:36.162
I hit it once in the eye.

470
00:29:36.242 --> 00:29:37.883
but I was twisted...

471
00:29:40.843 --> 00:29:42.723
..cos it had me
and the board under water.

472
00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:45.924
I hit it again.

473
00:29:47.524 --> 00:29:49.165
And then. boom. it lets me up.

474
00:29:52.725 --> 00:29:55.205
I was under maybe about 15 seconds.
I would say.

475
00:29:56.446 --> 00:29:58.926
So. what do you remember
about this particular shark?

476
00:30:00.606 --> 00:30:03.487
It was in no hurry.
And it wasn't scared.

477
00:30:05.607 --> 00:30:09.968
It just took me and was gonna do
whatever. you know. it felt like.

478
00:30:10.048 --> 00:30:11.969
And there was nothing
I could do about it.

479
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:15.409
And I looked back at my leg
and there was blood flowing out.

480
00:30:15.489 --> 00:30:17.130
It was just shredded.

481
00:30:18.969 --> 00:30:20.770
I started to paddle in.
and I thought.

482
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.490
"Man. you're gonna lose your leg."

483
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:26.371
And then I started to see spots.

484
00:30:27.531 --> 00:30:30.172
And I'm. like. "I'm not
gonna make it in."

485
00:30:30.251 --> 00:30:32.572
Luckily. all these surfers
that were in the water

486
00:30:32.652 --> 00:30:34.293
heard me screaming.

487
00:30:35.453 --> 00:30:37.093
They came running over.

488
00:30:38.293 --> 00:30:41.855
and a couple of them tried to put
a torniquet over my leg
with the leash.

489
00:30:46.495 --> 00:30:48.375
All these guys just started
to carry me.

490
00:30:49.855 --> 00:30:51.456
There was still blood everywhere.

491
00:30:51.536 --> 00:30:53.216
and then they just marched me up.

492
00:30:57.417 --> 00:31:00.697
And then they radioed
in a helicopter. (WHIRRING)

493
00:31:05.939 --> 00:31:08.418
If I was alone. there's no way
I would have made it.

494
00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:10.139
Did you know before you paddled out

495
00:31:10.219 --> 00:31:13.140
that there had been six shark
attacks right at this spot?

496
00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.941
I think a lot of the guys
that surf up here enjoy the solitude

497
00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:20.581
and don't worry about the sharks.

498
00:31:20.661 --> 00:31:22.902
It happens. Yeah.
there's been six attacks.

499
00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:25.422
but we surf up here a lot
and we stick together.

500
00:31:25.502 --> 00:31:28.423
And now. definitely.
I don't surf alone.

501
00:31:28.503 --> 00:31:30.343
I surf with the community. So...
Yeah.

502
00:31:36.224 --> 00:31:38.145
So. here's Eric Stanley's board.

503
00:31:38.224 --> 00:31:39.864
RALPH: That's a nasty bite.

504
00:31:40.905 --> 00:31:42.825
Yeah. I got the impression that. uh.

505
00:31:42.905 --> 00:31:45.226
Salmon Creek was very sharky.

506
00:31:45.306 --> 00:31:48.666
People refer to a lot
of places as sharky.

507
00:31:48.746 --> 00:31:51.947
a lot of sightings. recurring
attacks over and over.

508
00:31:54.267 --> 00:31:57.148
I wonder why they only seem to hang
off certain beaches?

509
00:31:57.228 --> 00:32:00.388
We refer to those places
as anchor points.

510
00:32:00.469 --> 00:32:02.949
locations where sharks
hunt their prey.

511
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:05.949
where they've had
success in the past maybe.

512
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:09.030
They keep returning
to those locations over and over.

513
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:11.111
Sounds a little like.
the. uh. rogue shark.

514
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.831
like the one from Jaws.

515
00:32:12.911 --> 00:32:16.351
Yeah. the rogue shark theory
has basically been debunked.

516
00:32:16.431 --> 00:32:18.631
However. there was a study

517
00:32:18.712 --> 00:32:22.472
that showed that some of
the techniques utilised
by white sharks

518
00:32:22.553 --> 00:32:26.273
are the same techniques
utilised by human serial killers.

519
00:32:26.353 --> 00:32:28.954
You mean. like anchor points?
Yes.

520
00:32:29.034 --> 00:32:31.074
Here. read this publication.

521
00:32:31.154 --> 00:32:32.794
I think you'll be surprised.

522
00:32:35.315 --> 00:32:36.955
This is amazing.

523
00:32:38.435 --> 00:32:41.996
Geographic profiling
is a technique normally
used by criminalists

524
00:32:42.076 --> 00:32:44.757
to identify a serial
killer's home base

525
00:32:44.837 --> 00:32:46.837
based on the location
of their crimes.

526
00:32:47.917 --> 00:32:52.118
Here. researchers use that same tool
to study the hunting patterns

527
00:32:52.198 --> 00:32:54.038
of white sharks in South Africa.

528
00:32:55.198 --> 00:32:57.159
I've gotta go check
this out for myself.

529
00:32:58.119 --> 00:33:01.640
In the wake of a fatal shark attack
off Morro Bay. California.

530
00:33:01.719 --> 00:33:04.160
Brandon has travelled
to South Africa

531
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.360
to learn more about
the killer's M.O.

532
00:33:08.601 --> 00:33:10.841
Great white sharks aren't malicious.

533
00:33:10.921 --> 00:33:13.882
nor do they suffer
from personality disorders.

534
00:33:13.962 --> 00:33:16.722
But research conducted
in these very waters

535
00:33:16.803 --> 00:33:19.923
shows that they use many
of the same strategies

536
00:33:20.003 --> 00:33:22.404
as human serial killers.

537
00:33:25.204 --> 00:33:27.684
Hey. Brandon. how is it. buddy?
Welcome to False Bay.

538
00:33:27.764 --> 00:33:29.484
home of the famous. uh. Seal Island.

539
00:33:29.564 --> 00:33:32.125
Yeah. I've been wanting
to come here for 20 years now.

540
00:33:32.205 --> 00:33:35.246
20 years. that's a long time.
Well. I'm glad you made it.

541
00:33:40.847 --> 00:33:42.487
So this is Seal Island.

542
00:33:45.687 --> 00:33:47.327
Right here in these waters.

543
00:33:48.888 --> 00:33:51.369
thousands of seals have been
taken out by great whites.

544
00:33:53.529 --> 00:33:55.169
These predations
were so predictable.

545
00:33:56.329 --> 00:33:58.810
researchers pretty much knew
exactly where

546
00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.570
and when the shark would strike.

547
00:34:10.532 --> 00:34:13.412
So. I read in a scientific paper
that Sector 4 is a spot

548
00:34:13.493 --> 00:34:16.013
where you used to see
the most white shark predations.

549
00:34:16.093 --> 00:34:17.733
Yeah. that is correct.

550
00:34:17.813 --> 00:34:21.614
Sector 4 is the hot spot
for white sharks predating on seals.

551
00:34:22.614 --> 00:34:24.255
We call it "the gauntlet."

552
00:34:24.335 --> 00:34:26.775
where seals leave the island
to go offshore feeding.

553
00:34:26.855 --> 00:34:29.615
and they have to come back
to to the island via Sector 4.

554
00:34:29.695 --> 00:34:31.336
And that's where the sharks hang out

555
00:34:31.416 --> 00:34:34.897
waiting for the opportunity
to strike at a seal passing by.

556
00:34:34.976 --> 00:34:37.017
These are the same sharks
over and over?

557
00:34:37.097 --> 00:34:40.257
Most times. yes. the same sharks.
especially the bigger ones.

558
00:34:40.337 --> 00:34:43.978
If you pinpoint the exact location
of previous attacks.

559
00:34:44.058 --> 00:34:48.179
you can accurately predict where
a shark or a serial killer

560
00:34:48.259 --> 00:34:49.899
might attack next.

561
00:34:49.979 --> 00:34:52.420
So. this is a spot. according
to the research paper.

562
00:34:52.499 --> 00:34:54.100
where the white sharks hunt.

563
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.861
Let's see what happens
when we tow a decoy through here.

564
00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:02.741
This used to be one of the most
active anchor points on the planet.

565
00:35:05.182 --> 00:35:06.822
But not any more.

566
00:35:13.664 --> 00:35:16.304
We towed for two hours. and nothing.

567
00:35:18.024 --> 00:35:19.664
Something is just not right here.

568
00:35:22.905 --> 00:35:26.106
So. when's the last time
you actually saw a white shark
breach here?

569
00:35:26.186 --> 00:35:28.706
June. July. 2019.

570
00:35:28.787 --> 00:35:31.667
And what's crazy is the seals'
behaviour has changed completely

571
00:35:31.747 --> 00:35:33.388
over the last three years.

572
00:35:33.467 --> 00:35:35.227
The white sharks
have been gone so long

573
00:35:35.308 --> 00:35:37.507
the seals have actually
changed their behaviour?

574
00:35:37.588 --> 00:35:41.709
Absolutely. For us. it's crazy
to see seals in areas we would
never see them roam before.

575
00:35:41.789 --> 00:35:43.429
They're hanging around that area

576
00:35:43.509 --> 00:35:45.349
knowing there's
no white sharks around.

577
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:51.351
It turns out that
the great white shark

578
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.191
has a serial killer of its own
to worry about.

579
00:35:57.791 --> 00:36:00.552
Stephan told me. two orca called
Port and Starboard

580
00:36:02.112 --> 00:36:04.313
started coming into False Bay
a few years back.

581
00:36:08.274 --> 00:36:09.914
The shark population thinned out.

582
00:36:11.194 --> 00:36:14.435
and finally.
just disappeared altogether.

583
00:36:15.875 --> 00:36:18.996
All evidence points
to a killing spree

584
00:36:19.075 --> 00:36:20.715
by these two killer whales.

585
00:36:25.636 --> 00:36:28.478
But there is one
place left in South Africa

586
00:36:28.557 --> 00:36:30.838
where Brandon can observe
great whites.

587
00:36:32.438 --> 00:36:34.719
Seal Rock in Mossel Bay.

588
00:36:36.519 --> 00:36:40.919
Here. the sharks gather at this
tiny island in one small area...

589
00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:44.320
..to hunt seals.

590
00:36:49.001 --> 00:36:52.881
Brandon will go to that spot hoping
to see an anchor point up close.

591
00:36:52.962 --> 00:36:57.242
to see for himself if great white
sharks can be reliably found there.

592
00:37:01.004 --> 00:37:02.804
He'll do it at night.

593
00:37:02.883 --> 00:37:05.723
when the sharks are believed
to be most active.

594
00:37:08.205 --> 00:37:09.885
The visibility is near zero.

595
00:37:12.405 --> 00:37:15.246
much the same as it was
off Morro Bay

596
00:37:15.325 --> 00:37:17.006
when Tomas Butterfield was hit.

597
00:37:19.607 --> 00:37:22.047
But the sharks are definitely here.

598
00:37:24.127 --> 00:37:27.288
and they don't need
to see their victims to hunt them.

599
00:37:30.689 --> 00:37:33.689
Mere minutes after Brandon
enters the water.

600
00:37:33.769 --> 00:37:37.130
a large. bold animal
is already locked onto him.

601
00:37:48.972 --> 00:37:52.172
It's like a phantom
disappearing in the murk.

602
00:37:54.053 --> 00:37:57.134
then reappearing
when Brandon least expects it.

603
00:38:13.816 --> 00:38:16.457
In Tomas Butterfield's last moments.

604
00:38:16.537 --> 00:38:19.417
it's likely he never saw
the shark that hit him.

605
00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.141
BRANDON: Great whites.
they really do share a lot
of the same characteristics

606
00:38:38.221 --> 00:38:40.101
as human serial killers.

607
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:44.102
The only difference
is great whites. they kill to eat.

608
00:38:44.182 --> 00:38:47.462
Humans. they kill for some bizarre
psychological reason.

609
00:38:48.863 --> 00:38:50.743
I think I'll take the sharks.
(EXHALES)

610
00:38:55.664 --> 00:38:58.345
How was South Africa?
Oh. amazing.

611
00:38:58.424 --> 00:39:00.505
Glad you came back in one piece.

612
00:39:00.585 --> 00:39:02.545
But I've got
some interesting information

613
00:39:02.625 --> 00:39:05.986
about the Tomas Butterfield
case in Morro Bay.

614
00:39:06.066 --> 00:39:11.067
Tell me. So. we determined the shark
responsible was 17 to 18ft long.

615
00:39:11.147 --> 00:39:14.828
Right. So. I've been on the internet
looking at an app

616
00:39:14.907 --> 00:39:17.588
put out by researchers
tagging sharks in California.

617
00:39:17.668 --> 00:39:22.309
Yeah. So it turns out an 18ft shark
that was tagged four years ago...

618
00:39:23.869 --> 00:39:26.189
..is still transmitting.

619
00:39:26.269 --> 00:39:29.710
Four years ago. she was measured
at 17 and a half feet.

620
00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:35.952
Today. she could have
easily grown to 18ft.

621
00:39:37.191 --> 00:39:38.872
And according to the app.

622
00:39:38.952 --> 00:39:42.913
it's spending a lot of time hanging
around off the California coast.

623
00:39:43.913 --> 00:39:46.553
That could be the shark
that attacked Tomas Butterfield.

624
00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:50.034
I mean. how many 18-footers
are swimming around out there?

625
00:39:50.114 --> 00:39:53.435
Precisely. And guess what
this shark's name is?

626
00:39:53.514 --> 00:39:55.155
No idea.

627
00:39:55.235 --> 00:39:56.875
Poe Girl.

628
00:39:56.955 --> 00:40:00.276
Poe Girl. as in Keith Poe.
our shark tagger?

629
00:40:00.355 --> 00:40:01.996
Yes.

630
00:40:08.517 --> 00:40:11.718
Keith Poe first tagged this giant
female with a satellite tracker

631
00:40:11.798 --> 00:40:13.639
in November of 2017...

632
00:40:15.158 --> 00:40:16.799
..off Point Conception.

633
00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:23.680
Tell me about this fish.
What was she like?

634
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.800
I put the bait out.
She took it.

635
00:40:25.881 --> 00:40:29.081
And we fought her.
and she fought like hell.

636
00:40:29.161 --> 00:40:30.801
Forward! Forward!

637
00:40:32.001 --> 00:40:33.682
Man. she's pulling hard. dude.

638
00:40:34.802 --> 00:40:36.442
And she never showed fear.

639
00:40:36.522 --> 00:40:38.843
A lot of them show.
what I believe is fear.

640
00:40:38.923 --> 00:40:41.083
And she didn't have
any fear in her at all.

641
00:40:48.365 --> 00:40:51.365
When I got her up here and I secured
her to the side of the boat

642
00:40:51.445 --> 00:40:53.325
and started to put the tag on her.

643
00:40:53.406 --> 00:40:55.886
she was working with me.
she was going along with it.

644
00:40:57.447 --> 00:41:00.127
God. I can't even lift her
she's so heavy. (GRUNTS)

645
00:41:03.447 --> 00:41:05.688
But once I pulled
that tail rope off.

646
00:41:05.768 --> 00:41:07.408
she said. "That's it.

647
00:41:09.968 --> 00:41:13.329
I'm done with you. This is over."
She started going crazy.

648
00:41:13.409 --> 00:41:16.849
And I took her off that cleat
and moved her to the back cleat.

649
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.570
Hooks about to come out.

650
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.491
She got it out.
It's barely in her mouth.

651
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:22.571
She could spike it.
she'll be able to go.

652
00:41:22.651 --> 00:41:25.131
Oh. yeah.

653
00:41:25.211 --> 00:41:27.452
And then she got
the hook out herself.

654
00:41:27.531 --> 00:41:29.412
But she was so aggressive.

655
00:41:29.493 --> 00:41:33.533
There she goes!
Yeah! (LAUGHS)

656
00:41:33.612 --> 00:41:35.253
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

657
00:41:35.333 --> 00:41:37.493
After you tagged her.
have you seen her since?

658
00:41:37.573 --> 00:41:41.054
Three months ago. I only got
glimpses of her here
at the side of the boat.

659
00:41:41.134 --> 00:41:42.774
But she looked even bigger to me.

660
00:41:42.855 --> 00:41:45.935
So. there's...There's no way
that shark's under 18 feet.

661
00:41:46.015 --> 00:41:47.655
if not. bigger. Yeah.

662
00:41:49.776 --> 00:41:53.137
The shark that bit Tomas Butterfield
was in the 18-foot range.

663
00:41:55.177 --> 00:41:59.858
According to Keith. Poe Girl is also
in the 18-foot range.

664
00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:03.898
Same shark? Who knows?

665
00:42:03.978 --> 00:42:06.339
I guess the big question is...

666
00:42:06.419 --> 00:42:09.139
Where was Poe Girl
last Christmas Eve?

667
00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.340
Poe Girl. What do you think?

668
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:19.181
Well. she was tagged November 23rd.
2017. off Point Conception.

669
00:42:19.261 --> 00:42:21.421
She's been all over
the Eastern Pacific.

670
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:23.142
But get this.

671
00:42:24.302 --> 00:42:31.143
she did pass by Morro Bay
on or about December 24th. 2021.

672
00:42:31.223 --> 00:42:32.864
Christmas Eve.

673
00:42:40.105 --> 00:42:42.345
So. where is she now?

674
00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:48.227
Well. she was last seen February
17th. 2022. heading offshore.

675
00:42:48.306 --> 00:42:50.627
somewhere out in the middle
of the Pacific

676
00:42:50.707 --> 00:42:52.587
where these animals seem
to aggregate.

677
00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:02.509
You think she'll be back?

678
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:06.510
All the data points to that.

679
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.430
This is a shark
that is very comfortable

680
00:43:10.511 --> 00:43:12.351
in the waters off Morro Bay.

681
00:43:17.992 --> 00:43:20.592
After more than a decade
investigating shark attacks

682
00:43:20.672 --> 00:43:23.232
off the Central California coast.

683
00:43:23.313 --> 00:43:26.394
Ralph and Brandon may have
finally identified

684
00:43:26.473 --> 00:43:28.634
the great white serial killer.

685
00:43:28.713 --> 00:43:30.914
But questions still remain.

686
00:43:36.595 --> 00:43:40.516
Has this predator found a new
anchor point at Morro Bay?

687
00:43:41.836 --> 00:43:43.476
And will she back...

688
00:43:44.596 --> 00:43:47.597
..to haunt these waters again?

689
00:43:57.519 --> 00:44:00.120
The answers may save lives...

690
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.440
..in this quiet seaside town.

691
00:44:05.521 --> 00:44:07.561
