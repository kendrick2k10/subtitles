00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.257
<i>Hello?</i>
Mr. Hill.

15
00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:31.592
How are we doing today?

16
00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:33.969
<i>Okay until you called.</i>

17
00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.305
Listen. I know
you have some minor concerns

18
00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:38.182
about the '07
that you saw the other day.

19
00:01:38.182 --> 00:01:40.434
but trust me.
nothing to worry about.

20
00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:43.479
I've even had
the GM himself vouch for this.

21
00:01:44.063 --> 00:01:45.856
<i>I think it's more
the fact that Jerry</i>

22
00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:47.817
<i>has the same model
for three grand less.</i>

23
00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:49.401
Oh. no. no. no. no.

24
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.237
Trust me.
you don't want to go to Jerry's.

25
00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:53.072
You know how much
their processing fee is?

26
00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:56.033
It's quite-- no. it's
three times as much as ours.

27
00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.285
<i>Well.
I don't know about that.</i>

28
00:01:58.285 --> 00:01:59.829
<i>but the price is still lower.</i>

29
00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:02.039
They keep their prices so low

30
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.374
so they can
take advantage of you

31
00:02:03.374 --> 00:02:04.583
on the other charges.

32
00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:06.043
Not just the processing fee.

33
00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:08.337
aftermarket. finance upselling.

34
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:09.839
Look. we don't do that here.

35
00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:13.843
Everyone on my sales team
takes integrity very seriously.

36
00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:19.014
<i>And you can vouch
that this wasn't in an
accident?</i>

37
00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.268
I'm looking
at the paperwork right now.

38
00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:28.524
<i>Let me check if
I have an open day this week.</i>

39
00:02:28.983 --> 00:02:31.652
No. no. no. just come in
today on your lunch break.

40
00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:33.404
It's very casual.
no commitments.

41
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:36.782
<i>Okay. okay.</i>

42
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.910
<i>I guess I could
stop by around one?</i>

43
00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:43.789
Wonderful.
Looking forward to it.

44
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.251
Wish me luck.

45
00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.170
Uh. aren't you
forgetting something?

46
00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.384
Destroying the hard copy.
That's what I got you for.

47
00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:58.220
- No. what about tonight?
- Yeah. don't worry about it.

48
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.763
I won't be home late.
I'll call you.

49
00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.853
So you wouldn't believe
how this bad boy got to us.

50
00:03:05.853 --> 00:03:07.897
I mean. every lot in town
was fighting for it.

51
00:03:07.897 --> 00:03:09.064
just for the trade.

52
00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:13.652
It was used in movies.
Bollywood.

53
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.863
I'm not big into movies.

54
00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:17.197
Well. the next owner. I mean.

55
00:03:17.448 --> 00:03:19.033
he had this thing
really souped up.

56
00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:21.243
Cat-Back exhaust.
Custom cylinder heads.

57
00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:23.454
- I mean. we're talking--
- Look. Jason.

58
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.205
Mason.

59
00:03:26.874 --> 00:03:29.835
Mason. it's not for me.
I don't drive.

60
00:03:29.835 --> 00:03:32.046
It's a graduation gift
for my son.

61
00:03:33.005 --> 00:03:36.133
Oh. Well. it's still good
information to have.

62
00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:38.969
Look. the price.
I'm glad that you matched it.

63
00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:42.264
But Jerry is saying
his VIN report is clean.

64
00:03:42.264 --> 00:03:43.974
and this one is damaged.

65
00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:47.978
Way ahead of you.

66
00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.606
I did some digging. and I found
the original paperwork.

67
00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:52.858
So whatever you saw
was probably just a mistake.

68
00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.036
M-A-S-O-N.

69
00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:05.871
I don't know how you do it.

70
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:08.916
Mason.

71
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.217
You look happy.

72
00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:20.094
Another satisfied customer.

73
00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:23.180
and somewhere one more angel
loses its wings.

74
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.516
Well. I hope the brakes hold up.

75
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.643
I got a call today.

76
00:04:28.227 --> 00:04:30.312
You delivered
two vans last week.

77
00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:32.564
Yeah. the two 12-passengers.
You know.

78
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.068
Uh. I know they were
supposed to be wholesaled.

79
00:04:36.068 --> 00:04:37.361
Yeah. but those
governmental types.

80
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:38.487
they always overpay.

81
00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:39.655
You see the gross on it?

82
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.701
Mason. you sold two junkyard
pieces of shit

83
00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:46.245
as accessible rides

84
00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:48.956
for the city's
disabled workforce fleet.

85
00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.916
Sounds like you plagiarized
that from an official letter.

86
00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:53.043
They're threatening
to shut me down.

87
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.298
Hey. i-- it'll blow over.
It always does.

88
00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:02.553
Mason.

89
00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:05.347
In the past.

90
00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.891
I've been able
to overlook your shenanigans.

91
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:10.936
But lately you've been
making it very difficult.

92
00:05:10.936 --> 00:05:12.229
And now this.

93
00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:14.106
I can't do it.

94
00:05:17.776 --> 00:05:20.195
Boss. I can sell anything.

95
00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:22.656
Isn't that what you want?
That's what I am here for.

96
00:05:23.282 --> 00:05:24.450
Mason. I'm sorry.

97
00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:26.827
I don't see
any way out of this one.

98
00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.496
Someone's head's got to roll.

99
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.998
and it ain't gonna be mine.

What day is it. Mason?

109
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:22.758
Tuesday?

110
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.886
Oh. just an average Tuesday?

111
00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:27.805
Not our anniversary at all. huh?

112
00:06:28.806 --> 00:06:30.516
Oh. no. Uh. yes.

113
00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:32.518
I-- I called Gino's.

114
00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:34.019
but they didn't have
a table available.

115
00:06:34.019 --> 00:06:35.354
So I was just
gonna defer to you--

116
00:06:35.354 --> 00:06:36.939
Oh. fuck you. Mason.

117
00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:38.273
You know.
your bullshittery might work

118
00:06:38.273 --> 00:06:39.608
on your dumbass customers.

119
00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.276
but I see right through you.

120
00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.529
- No. babe--
- Don't "babe" me.

121
00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:44.822
Come on. I had a hell
of a day.

122
00:06:44.822 --> 00:06:46.448
You and all your excuses.

123
00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:49.368
- It never ends.
- No. but this is a good one.

124
00:06:49.368 --> 00:06:51.537
Oh. a good one.
That'll be the day.

125
00:06:51.537 --> 00:06:53.455
And by the way.
how drunk are you right now?

126
00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:55.874
Wait. just listen.

127
00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:02.131
I-- I-- I'm sorry.
Alison. but I...

128
00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:06.135
I kinda sorta lost my job today.

129
00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:11.640
You lost your job?

130
00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.017
Yeah.

131
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.979
You're joking. How?

132
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.774
I lost it.

133
00:07:22.276 --> 00:07:24.319
So what.
you were standing around

134
00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:27.406
and all of a sudden it was like.
"Hey. where'd my job go?"

135
00:07:27.406 --> 00:07:29.658
Well. look.
it wasn't exactly like I--

136
00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:31.869
"I could have sworn I had
my job right here in my pocket."

137
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:33.912
Well. if I could
just explain myself--

138
00:07:33.912 --> 00:07:36.248
"Hey. I've got an idea.

139
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.668
Let's go on
a scavenger hunt for your job."

140
00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:42.838
- No. please.
-"Hello. job. you in there?"

141
00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:44.506
Come on. this isn't helping.

142
00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:46.175
No. wait. maybe there's
a job inside this one.

143
00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:47.426
Alison!

144
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:53.307
Look. do you still
want to go to Gino's?

145
00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:55.559
Maybe we can get
mozzarella sticks.

146
00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:02.900
Fine.

147
00:08:04.026 --> 00:08:06.236
- Yeah?
- Yeah. let's go.

148
00:08:07.362 --> 00:08:08.655
You sure? Should I change?

149
00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:12.826
No. let's go. Just like this.

150
00:08:16.413 --> 00:08:17.497
Okay.

151
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.716
Hey. maybe you should
actually drive. you know?

152
00:08:30.052 --> 00:08:31.511
Come on. Alison.

153
00:08:32.554 --> 00:08:35.015
You-- you're not
kicking me out. are you?

154
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.184
Where am I supposed to go?

155
00:08:40.812 --> 00:08:42.773
You can talk
your way out of anything.

156
00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:43.941
You'll figure it out.

157
00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:47.027
Wh-- what about all of my stuff?

158
00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:51.823
No. don't do that.

159
00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:54.284
No. come on. What--

160
00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.620
Come on. Alison.

161
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.914
Wha-- No. those are nice suits.

162
00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:05.879
Get the fuck off my property.
and out of my life.

163
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:09.216
Alison.

164
00:09:09.883 --> 00:09:10.968
Alison!

165
00:09:55.137 --> 00:09:57.806
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hey. Brian. how are--

166
00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:59.808
<i>It's David.</i>
- David.

167
00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.601
My-- my bad.

168
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.603
My contacts. man.
they're really messed up.

169
00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.231
Uh. anyway. long time no speak.

170
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.317
Hey. listen. I have
a really big favor to ask.

171
00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:10.110
I was wondering
if you might have a couch

172
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.112
that I could crash on
for a few days because--

173
00:10:15.324 --> 00:10:16.950
Oh. no. that's fine.

174
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.244
That's fine. yeah. take care.
No worries.

175
00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.622
Hi. saw you're looking for
a sales expert.

176
00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:24.583
<i>Thank you.</i>

177
00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:26.752
Absolutely. I can sell anything.
What is it that you guys--

178
00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:28.462
<i>We sell decorative
paper.</i>

179
00:10:28.462 --> 00:10:31.048
Decorative paper?
<i>That's right.</i>

180
00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:32.466
Yeah. fuck it. I can--

181
00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:34.718
Uh. just tell me
when to come in.

182
00:10:34.718 --> 00:10:36.261
<i>Unpaid internship.</i>

183
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:38.263
I'm sorry. what?
<i>Unpaid.</i>

184
00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:40.307
Unpaid internship.

185
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.853
Hello. Jordan?
<i>Hey.</i>

186
00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:46.396
<i>- Hello. How you doing?</i>
- Hey.

187
00:10:46.396 --> 00:10:48.357
How are--
Uh. yeah. I'm-- I'm great.

188
00:10:48.357 --> 00:10:50.525
Um. actually. I'm not great.

189
00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:51.693
Listen. Alison...

190
00:10:52.778 --> 00:10:54.321
Alison kicked me out again.

191
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:56.073
This time for good. I think.

192
00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:58.116
<i>Oh. yeah. I get it.</i>
- Yeah. yeah.

193
00:10:58.116 --> 00:11:00.535
Uh. and I was wondering
if you had a couch or something

194
00:11:00.535 --> 00:11:02.496
that I might be able
to crash on for a few days.

195
00:11:02.496 --> 00:11:03.747
That would really be helpful.

196
00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:05.957
Jordan?

197
00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:07.667
Hello. Jordan?

198
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:17.344
Motherfucking God. bitch.

199
00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:20.138
son of a fucking whore.
piece of shit!

200
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.399
Mint?

201
00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:14.568
Sure.

202
00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:22.784
"McGinness. Mr."

203
00:12:24.411 --> 00:12:26.955
Do you like money.
McGinness. Mr.?

204
00:12:27.497 --> 00:12:30.167
Has anyone in this chair
ever told you otherwise?

205
00:12:30.167 --> 00:12:32.836
There have been more
than a few in that chair.

206
00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:35.088
Better wash those pants.

207
00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:38.967
Mr. Bendt. with all due respect.

208
00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.844
I've been in sales
for a long time.

209
00:12:40.844 --> 00:12:42.179
I know how this works.

210
00:12:42.179 --> 00:12:43.763
Power in numbers.

211
00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.223
survival of the fittest.

212
00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:48.727
What is your deepest fear?

213
00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:53.356
I don't know.
I-- I'd have to think about it.

214
00:12:54.483 --> 00:12:56.985
Mine? Dying alone.

215
00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:01.740
But then I always keep a roll
of hundreds in bed by my side.

216
00:13:05.494 --> 00:13:07.787
Also. spiders.

217
00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:11.208
Trust me. I don't need
the extra motivation.

218
00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:15.587
Well. a self-motivated fella.

219
00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.715
I have agents in this office

220
00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:22.260
looking to take on
as much inventory as they can.

221
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.639
But that's not how
you'll succeed here.

222
00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:28.016
You need the right property.

223
00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.809
and I need the right man.

224
00:13:30.268 --> 00:13:32.646
- You sold real estate before?
- Briefly.

225
00:13:32.646 --> 00:13:34.940
I-- I sold condos
for about ten years

226
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.566
before I got into selling cars.

227
00:13:36.566 --> 00:13:38.527
You're a buyer's agent.

228
00:13:38.527 --> 00:13:40.362
I need a seller's agent.

229
00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:42.197
Mr. Bendt.

230
00:13:42.197 --> 00:13:44.032
I've pretty much sold
everything.

231
00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:45.784
and believe me.
I'm up to the challenge.

232
00:13:51.039 --> 00:13:53.708
Cindy. hold all my calls.

233
00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.132
Well. McGinness...

234
00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:04.261
you just might be in luck.

235
00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:07.556
I have some of the most
unsellable properties

236
00:14:07.556 --> 00:14:08.682
in this state.

237
00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:12.269
One of 'em.
the foundation's being rebuilt.

238
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:13.395
It sank.

239
00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:17.148
Morons built it
on a fucking swamp.

240
00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:19.484
The other one...

241
00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:23.071
this one...

242
00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:28.034
well. it has a history
that turns people off.

243
00:14:28.577 --> 00:14:29.786
What kind of history?

244
00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:32.706
Oh. you know. people talk.

245
00:14:33.164 --> 00:14:35.500
Had it so long. I own the deed.

246
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.128
Can't even give away
any of the furniture.

247
00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:41.298
Furniture? Like. a bed?

248
00:14:41.298 --> 00:14:43.341
You can't even give away

249
00:14:43.341 --> 00:14:45.093
any of the old lady's stuff.

250
00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.262
It's money
going down the shitter.

251
00:14:48.305 --> 00:14:49.389
What's the offer?

252
00:14:54.603 --> 00:14:56.730
For that one...

253
00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:01.192
35%.

254
00:15:03.403 --> 00:15:04.613
Shit.

255
00:15:05.447 --> 00:15:06.698
Full partner.

256
00:15:08.491 --> 00:15:10.327
You see. I'm serious here.

257
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.455
I don't want to have
anything to do with that place.

258
00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:16.041
I want it gone yesterday.

259
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.585
Well. you could always just
burn it to the ground. right?

260
00:15:19.336 --> 00:15:21.171
Well. I'm not sure.

261
00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:26.176
But given your enthusiasm.

262
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.804
you just might be
the man for the job.

263
00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:37.937
All right. McGinness.
we'll give it a shot.

264
00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.606
Thank you. sir.
Thank you so much.

265
00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:41.608
Um. I can get started today.

266
00:15:41.608 --> 00:15:43.026
uh. get a feel for the place.

267
00:15:43.026 --> 00:15:44.944
the layout. uh.
sleeping quarters.

268
00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:47.781
I'll have Cindy set you up
with the paperwork and the keys.

269
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:49.282
Thank you. I won't let you down.

270
00:15:52.327 --> 00:15:53.411
Hey.

271
00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:57.624
You never told me
your worst fear.

272
00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:01.211
Failure.

273
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.841
I think in time.

274
00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.636
you're gonna be a little
more imaginative than that.

275
00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.607
{\an8}Jeez. no wonder no one's buying.

276
00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:32.607
Oh. yeah.

277
00:20:32.607 --> 00:20:34.275

Oh. shit.

298
00:22:51.788 --> 00:22:53.456
Fuck.

299
00:23:01.589 --> 00:23:02.673
Hmm.

300
00:23:03.174 --> 00:23:04.967
World's most powerful oven.

301
00:23:04.967 --> 00:23:06.636
I'll be sure to include that.

302
00:23:24.987 --> 00:23:28.282
Oh. yeah. that's the stuff.

303
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:34.205
Hello?

304
00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:39.544
Bad wiring. too?

305
00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:48.636
"Beautiful country--"

306
00:23:49.137 --> 00:23:50.888
No. No.

307
00:23:52.932 --> 00:23:54.684
"Rustic home--"

308
00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:02.358
"Idyllic abode.

309
00:24:03.192 --> 00:24:05.403
will turn heads.

310
00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:06.946
Will take your breath away."

311
00:24:08.531 --> 00:24:10.533
It sounds like
you're selling a damn car.

312
00:24:14.954 --> 00:24:17.540
"Beautiful. idyllic abode...

313
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.835
will remind you

314
00:24:20.835 --> 00:24:23.546
of what the good life
is supposed to be.

315
00:24:27.925 --> 00:24:31.262
A house is more than a home.

316
00:24:31.262 --> 00:24:34.557
it's a place
where we raise our families.

317
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.852
We start with
the center of it all.

318
00:24:37.852 --> 00:24:41.397
mom. whose warm essence
is a calm reminder

319
00:24:41.397 --> 00:24:43.816
that everything
will be all right.

320
00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:46.944
And then there's dad. a beacon

321
00:24:46.944 --> 00:24:49.322
who will always.
always be there.

322
00:24:49.322 --> 00:24:52.658
And the children--
oh. the children.

323
00:24:52.658 --> 00:24:55.620
the siblings
you can forever depend on.

324
00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:59.874
A connection for which
friendship is no substitute.

325
00:25:01.584 --> 00:25:04.879
When we think of a house.
we think of love.

326
00:25:05.588 --> 00:25:08.799
And when I think
of you in this house.

327
00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:11.385
what I see above all else

328
00:25:11.385 --> 00:25:13.429
is that feeling right here.

329
00:25:14.764 --> 00:25:16.390
You know it when you see it.

330
00:25:17.016 --> 00:25:20.061
And I look at you and I see it.

331
00:25:20.978 --> 00:25:22.939
You in this home.

332
00:25:25.524 --> 00:25:27.443
So eat my fucking ass.

333
00:25:27.443 --> 00:25:29.528
and let's party up this bitch."

334
00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:42.083
Sometimes I can't believe
my own luck.

335
00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:39.617
Who's there?

336
00:28:59.655 --> 00:29:01.282
Prospective client already?

337
00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:05.494
Let's do it. huh? Let's do it!

338
00:29:25.222 --> 00:29:28.142
I slit a sheet. a sheet I slit.
upon a slitted sheet I sit.

339
00:29:28.642 --> 00:29:29.935
Unique New York.
unique New York.

340
00:29:29.935 --> 00:29:31.520
unique New York.
unique New York.

Hello. folks.

342
00:29:38.027 --> 00:29:39.612

Hello. folks. I'm Mason.

344
00:29:43.866 --> 00:29:45.075
Beautiful home. isn't it?

345
00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:47.203
Hi f--

346
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:02.801
Hi. fucks--
uh. folks.

347
00:30:04.303 --> 00:30:05.387
You must be the Andersons.

348
00:30:06.722 --> 00:30:08.015
Alderson. I'm Jean.

349
00:30:08.724 --> 00:30:10.684
Ted Delancy. Jean's agent.

350
00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:13.979
Excellent. Well. I'm Mason.
Please. come on in.

351
00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:15.648
I've got such sights
to show you.

352
00:30:25.491 --> 00:30:27.409
Let me just get
some lights on. and...

353
00:30:31.914 --> 00:30:33.916
It's-- it's probably
just a bad bulb.

354
00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:35.876
Or five.

355
00:30:35.876 --> 00:30:37.086
But actually.
maybe that's better.

356
00:30:38.045 --> 00:30:41.090
This way you can see
how unnecessary electricity is

357
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.425
in a house
with such ample sunshine.

358
00:30:44.343 --> 00:30:45.928
It was built with that in mind.

359
00:30:46.887 --> 00:30:49.098
Um. please. follow me.

360
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.978
As you can see.
this space is quite open.

361
00:30:53.978 --> 00:30:55.104
Very welcoming.

362
00:30:55.646 --> 00:30:58.232
Is this an original wood stove?

363
00:31:01.026 --> 00:31:05.656
Yes. it's an 1812 original iron.

364
00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:13.205
Um. a house is more than a home.

365
00:31:13.664 --> 00:31:16.083
It's a place
where we raise our families.

366
00:31:16.083 --> 00:31:17.543
And we start
with the center of it all.

367
00:31:17.543 --> 00:31:19.086
Chicken?

368
00:31:24.592 --> 00:31:25.676
Or turkey?

369
00:31:28.262 --> 00:31:31.056
Oh. well. um.

370
00:31:31.056 --> 00:31:33.976
a-- actually.
this is a great furnace

371
00:31:33.976 --> 00:31:35.686
for a rotisserie spit.

372
00:31:36.562 --> 00:31:39.565
Mm. nothing quite like
sitting back with a loved one

373
00:31:39.565 --> 00:31:41.275
on a chilly winter's evening

374
00:31:41.275 --> 00:31:43.986
while you're roasting
a really big chicken.

375
00:31:45.613 --> 00:31:47.823
Surely there's a kitchen
for that.

376
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:00.419
Kitchen. Follow me.

377
00:32:02.046 --> 00:32:03.964
Uh.

378
00:32:03.964 --> 00:32:06.258
sometimes birds
can get stuck in there.

379
00:32:06.258 --> 00:32:07.926
What with the flue having that.

380
00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:11.013
um. classic
old-time narrow design.

381
00:32:15.601 --> 00:32:17.895
What's in this room?

382
00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:20.314
Um. storage.

383
00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.026
Can we take a look?

384
00:32:25.653 --> 00:32:27.613
I'm actually
missing the key for that.

385
00:32:27.613 --> 00:32:29.948
but I will be happy to get you
some old photos from the office

386
00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:31.075
and forward them to you.

387
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:33.035
Hey.

388
00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:37.956
Hey. uh. you know.

389
00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:40.167
why don't we go
check out the rest?

390
00:32:53.972 --> 00:32:56.809
I think we are finally
going to have that "wow" moment.

391
00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.942
Oh. and there's a really nice
reading room in here. too.

392
00:33:07.152 --> 00:33:08.445
Maybe-- Oh! Oh!

393
00:33:17.955 --> 00:33:19.915
Were those chairs
always in that spot before?

394
00:33:21.291 --> 00:33:22.876
Yes.

395
00:33:22.876 --> 00:33:24.378
Actually. uh. yeah.
I put those chairs there

396
00:33:24.378 --> 00:33:26.547
so I could. uh. remind myself

397
00:33:26.547 --> 00:33:28.132
to show you this room
on the way out.

398
00:33:28.132 --> 00:33:29.883
But. uh...

399
00:33:29.883 --> 00:33:31.844
...really. you gotta see
the master bedroom first.

400
00:33:31.844 --> 00:33:33.220
So please. follow me.

401
00:33:47.818 --> 00:33:50.112
Anyway. uh. here we go.

402
00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:52.197
Brace yourselves.

403
00:33:58.454 --> 00:33:59.830
I love this room.

404
00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:02.249
It faces west.

405
00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:04.877
so you get that beautiful
sunset glow coming through.

406
00:34:05.794 --> 00:34:08.464
And a brand new rug
for those snug nights

407
00:34:08.464 --> 00:34:10.132
when you want to just. uh...

408
00:34:11.175 --> 00:34:12.843
unexpectedly wake up
on the floor.

409
00:34:12.843 --> 00:34:14.011
I'm sorry. what?

410
00:34:14.636 --> 00:34:16.013
Do you hear that?

411
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:18.974
Yeah.

412
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:21.643
It's like. a scratching.

413
00:34:23.771 --> 00:34:26.064
Oh. probably
just the central air.

414
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:28.400
Few things better in a home
than central air.

415
00:34:29.067 --> 00:34:30.819
It sounds like
it's coming from the closet.

416
00:34:55.511 --> 00:34:56.929
Yeah. uh. yeah.

417
00:34:57.387 --> 00:35:00.682
This is more
of an old-time vanity or a...

418
00:35:01.975 --> 00:35:03.060
an armoire.

419
00:35:06.772 --> 00:35:09.399
- Hey!
- Oh. so-- I'm sorry.

420
00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:11.944
Um. that's probably just...

421
00:35:19.284 --> 00:35:21.245
...it's just drafty.
you know. it's--

422
00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:31.380
Yeah. like I said.
uh. central air.

423
00:35:39.805 --> 00:35:42.057
So. technically.
it's a smart home!

424
00:35:42.057 --> 00:35:44.184
The furniture knows exactly
when to move itself!

425
00:35:45.894 --> 00:35:48.063
I'm sorry. folks.
I'm way off my game today.

426
00:35:48.063 --> 00:35:49.606
This house is a steal. Really.

427
00:35:49.606 --> 00:35:51.441
Don't let my bumbling
get in the way

428
00:35:51.441 --> 00:35:53.277
- of such a great opportunity.
- Thanks. but no thanks.

429
00:36:12.087 --> 00:36:13.171
Bendt.

430
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.923
Hello. Mr. Bendt?

431
00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:16.550
Ho-- how are you. sir?

432
00:36:17.134 --> 00:36:20.012
Ah. McGinness. Mr.
How is everything going?

433
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:23.140
Going? Well. going well.

434
00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.225
Uh. well.
that's why I'm calling.

435
00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.353
Uh. is there something
going on here?

436
00:36:30.606 --> 00:36:31.940
Like what?

437
00:36:32.608 --> 00:36:34.818
Yeah. either there's someone
messing with me in this house.

438
00:36:34.818 --> 00:36:37.112
or. uh. I don't know.

439
00:36:37.112 --> 00:36:39.489
maybe it's just really drafty
all the time?

440
00:36:43.076 --> 00:36:45.913
Sounds to me
like what people call ghosts.

441
00:36:47.331 --> 00:36:48.457
Sorry?

442
00:36:48.457 --> 00:36:51.168
Ghosts! Ghosts!

443
00:36:53.503 --> 00:36:55.589
Come on.

444
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:57.966
What is this.
some kind of initiation?

445
00:36:57.966 --> 00:37:02.387
Oh. to tell you the truth.
it's all a bunch of hooey.

446
00:37:03.305 --> 00:37:05.599
Sometimes when these
houses are built.

447
00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:09.144
they're built in a way
that causes optical illusions.

448
00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:14.733
Uh. you know. it's an old house.

449
00:37:15.859 --> 00:37:17.277
Optical illusions?

450
00:37:17.819 --> 00:37:21.073
Ah. but it's understandable
because of what happened there.

451
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:23.325
Too many murders in there.

452
00:37:23.325 --> 00:37:25.410
That's why
it's so damn hard to sell.

453
00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:31.792
Look. just give me a chance
to run with the big dogs.

454
00:37:31.792 --> 00:37:34.044
Any prime listing
and I will sell it faster.

455
00:37:34.044 --> 00:37:36.630
I will sell it for more.
and I will work for less.

456
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:39.800
I enjoy your enthusiasm

457
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.385
and zest for life.

458
00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:43.845
However. I should remind you.

459
00:37:44.262 --> 00:37:46.598
you're not technically
working for me.

460
00:37:47.099 --> 00:37:49.893
You're an independent
contractor.

461
00:37:50.477 --> 00:37:53.563
Which reminds me.
I'll need that W-9 form

462
00:37:53.563 --> 00:37:55.065
as soon as possible.

463
00:38:05.659 --> 00:38:08.245
Haunted house?
No such thing.

464
00:38:09.162 --> 00:38:12.708
There's haunted dreams.
haunted relationships.

465
00:38:12.708 --> 00:38:14.084
haunted memories.

466
00:38:15.293 --> 00:38:18.130
Heights barely reached.
roads never taken.

467
00:38:20.549 --> 00:38:21.675
I can do this.

468
00:38:26.263 --> 00:38:28.432
Haunted house. my ass!

469
00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:32.811
Who's in here?

470
00:38:46.783 --> 00:38:49.327
Come on out!
I know someone's fuckin' around!

471
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:55.751
All right. haunted house.

472
00:38:55.751 --> 00:38:58.754
Let's see if you can go
toe-to-toe with big Mase.

473
00:39:32.996 --> 00:39:34.414
{\an8}Suck it. ghosts.

474
00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:51.681
<i>What?</i>
- Hi. hey. how are you?

475
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:54.518
What do you want?

476
00:39:55.894 --> 00:39:58.480
I just wanted to hear
the sound of your voice.

477
00:39:59.356 --> 00:40:01.942
Okay. listen to this.

478
00:40:01.942 --> 00:40:03.318
<i>Fuck off!</i>

479
00:40:04.027 --> 00:40:07.030
Alison. will you please
just listen. just one minute?

480
00:40:09.366 --> 00:40:11.034
Go.

481
00:40:14.162 --> 00:40:16.790
Okay. so I know
I've made some mistakes.

482
00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:20.418
Actually.
I've made a lot of mistakes.

483
00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:22.379
But I want you to know
that I've got a new job.

484
00:40:22.379 --> 00:40:24.548
new accommodations.
and I'm back on my feet.

485
00:40:24.548 --> 00:40:26.174
and more determined than ever.

486
00:40:26.174 --> 00:40:28.301
Life has always
thrown me curveballs.

487
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:30.512
and I've always managed
to hit it out of the park.

488
00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.265
Are you for real?

489
00:40:33.974 --> 00:40:35.433
Yeah. definitely.

490
00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:37.018
Well.
not always out of the park.

491
00:40:37.018 --> 00:40:38.854
but at least
a double or a single.

492
00:40:38.854 --> 00:40:40.105
Mason...

493
00:40:41.773 --> 00:40:43.316
To be honest.
this place is starting to

494
00:40:43.316 --> 00:40:45.193
feel like more of a bunt.

495
00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:47.737
But the point is. there is
no striking out over here.

496
00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:49.823
You don't get it. do you?

497
00:40:51.324 --> 00:40:52.409
What?

498
00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:57.873
I should've known
from the start.

499
00:40:57.873 --> 00:41:00.458
All that shit with your mom.

500
00:41:01.293 --> 00:41:03.503
My mom? Why are you
bringing her into this?

501
00:41:03.503 --> 00:41:05.130
You know what you did.

502
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.091
I kept my mom from being
homeless is what I did.

503
00:41:08.091 --> 00:41:09.843
You stole a lot of money

504
00:41:09.843 --> 00:41:11.720
and got stripped
of your licenses.

505
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.472
Hey. she was in trouble.
I did what I had to do.

506
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:17.184
You didn't do it for her!
You did it for yourself.

507
00:41:17.184 --> 00:41:19.394
She wound up in
a nursing home anyway.

508
00:41:19.394 --> 00:41:21.313
And then you got caught.

509
00:41:21.313 --> 00:41:24.608
and now all you can do are
these shitty little hustles.

510
00:41:26.234 --> 00:41:27.819
You don't care
who gets screwed over

511
00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:29.613
as long as your ego
doesn't get pricked.

512
00:41:35.577 --> 00:41:37.162
Alison. I--

513
00:41:46.796 --> 00:41:48.256
Hello?

514
00:41:58.308 --> 00:42:00.268
Uh. Alison? Uh...

515
00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:04.314
if you could maybe find it in
your heart to please forgive me.

516
00:42:04.314 --> 00:42:07.484
we could continue
building a life together again.

517
00:42:09.778 --> 00:42:12.989
Look. you sold me
on a better life.

518
00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:16.743
But... it was just an empty box.

519
00:42:16.743 --> 00:42:17.953
So...

520
00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:20.747
consider me swindled too.

521
00:42:40.725 --> 00:42:44.062
No. Don't look at it.
Don't look.

522
00:43:19.222 --> 00:43:21.057
All right. come on out!

523
00:43:25.562 --> 00:43:27.689
I know someone's
fuckin' with me!

524
00:43:39.868 --> 00:43:41.494
You think you're
pretty clever. huh?

525
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:56.259
Fuck! Goddamn it! Dang it!

526
00:44:25.538 --> 00:44:27.248
<i>Mason?</i>

527
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:45.558
<i>I don't want to.</i>

528
00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:50.522
<i>Don't make me go.</i>

529
00:44:58.113 --> 00:44:59.197
Mom?

530
00:45:56.963 --> 00:45:58.590
I need to start taking it easy.

531
00:46:13.146 --> 00:46:15.482
Oh. shit.

532
00:46:19.736 --> 00:46:23.072
I slit a sheet. a sheet I slit.
upon a slitted sheet I sit.

533
00:46:27.744 --> 00:46:29.287
Hi. guys. How we doing today?

534
00:46:31.915 --> 00:46:33.708
That right there is a...

535
00:46:34.501 --> 00:46:36.127
silver maple.

536
00:46:37.212 --> 00:46:38.421
A rare deciduous.

537
00:46:39.672 --> 00:46:40.757
Is that so?

538
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:46.095
Hi. Uh. the name's Mason.

539
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.019
Can I. uh.
help you guys with anything?

540
00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:54.437
Show you around?

541
00:46:55.438 --> 00:46:57.398
Saw that the place is for sale.

542
00:46:58.024 --> 00:47:00.527
Very much for sale.
Couldn't be more for sale.

543
00:47:00.527 --> 00:47:02.445
And at a very low price. too.
I might add.

544
00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:05.281
Such a beautiful place.

545
00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:07.867
Why would anyone give this up?

546
00:47:09.244 --> 00:47:11.579
Oh. the current owners
are expecting again.

547
00:47:12.455 --> 00:47:14.290
Unexpectedly outgrown.

548
00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:16.292
But their fortune
might favor your fortune.

549
00:47:16.292 --> 00:47:18.545
because this here
is truly the perfect place

550
00:47:18.545 --> 00:47:20.630
for that couple
looking to take their lives

551
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.006
to the next stage.

552
00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.593
What stage is that?

553
00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:31.516
Whatever stage
you want it to be.

554
00:47:34.727 --> 00:47:38.523
Well... aren't you going to ask?

555
00:47:40.108 --> 00:47:41.317
Ask?

556
00:47:44.445 --> 00:47:45.780
Can we see the inside?

557
00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:50.994
Of course. Follow me.

558
00:47:57.667 --> 00:47:59.294
A little chillier
than usual today.

559
00:47:59.294 --> 00:48:01.254
but fortunately we have this.

560
00:48:01.254 --> 00:48:03.172
An original
hand-carved wood stove

561
00:48:03.172 --> 00:48:05.216
that will warm you up
real quick.

562
00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:08.219
- Lovely.
- Do you folks like cooking?

563
00:48:08.219 --> 00:48:10.805
I think the previous owners
used this as a smoker.

564
00:48:11.347 --> 00:48:13.349
That sounds like a fun idea.

565
00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.396
Do you know the one thing I keep
hearing clients are looking for

566
00:48:18.396 --> 00:48:19.731
in a new home?

567
00:48:19.731 --> 00:48:22.066
- Closet space.
- A drink.

568
00:48:27.155 --> 00:48:28.239
A new oven.

569
00:48:32.035 --> 00:48:34.203
Maybe you can show us
the bedroom?

570
00:48:36.497 --> 00:48:39.542
Yes. of course.
Uh. please. follow me.

571
00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:49.427
I am telling you. I really love

572
00:48:49.427 --> 00:48:51.387
the amount of sunlight
this room gets.

573
00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.600
Little hot in here.
don't you think?

574
00:48:56.601 --> 00:48:58.227
Well. once the central air hits.

575
00:48:58.227 --> 00:49:00.313
we're talking
lap of luxury level comfort.

576
00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:12.116
Still a few mechanical bugs
to be worked out.

577
00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:14.202
but that will be taken care of.
not to worry.

578
00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:19.999
- What do you think?
- Stop.

579
00:49:23.002 --> 00:49:24.671
I-- I'm sorry.
can I get you something?

580
00:49:27.632 --> 00:49:29.384
I'm sorry. My eczema.

581
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:31.844
Oh. Right.

582
00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:36.182
It would just be easier
if I could get medication.

583
00:49:36.766 --> 00:49:38.351
Well. it's expensive.

584
00:49:39.268 --> 00:49:41.938
And yet here we are.
buying a house.

585
00:49:41.938 --> 00:49:43.731
You know what?

586
00:49:43.731 --> 00:49:45.525
Why don't you go take a look
inside that kitchen?

587
00:50:01.833 --> 00:50:04.210
I'm just gonna show her
the. uh. new oven.

588
00:50:14.512 --> 00:50:16.222
Hi. Mrs.--

589
00:50:16.222 --> 00:50:19.600
Uh. actually. I don't even think
I got your names.

590
00:50:22.937 --> 00:50:24.021
I like this.

591
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:28.234
The-- the kitchen?

592
00:50:29.652 --> 00:50:30.737
Yeah.

593
00:50:31.612 --> 00:50:33.781
It's... familiar.

594
00:50:37.118 --> 00:50:38.953
Yeah. Sure. yeah.

595
00:50:38.953 --> 00:50:41.080
It's got some really great
carpentry work over here.

596
00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.083
and then what I really like--

597
00:50:47.044 --> 00:50:48.921
Oh. jeez. I'm-- I'm sorry.

598
00:50:49.797 --> 00:50:51.632
He-- hey.
I know it's not my place.

599
00:50:51.632 --> 00:50:53.384
but is there
anything I could do?

600
00:50:59.515 --> 00:51:00.850
No. it's okay.

601
00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:05.271
Sometimes...

602
00:51:06.272 --> 00:51:07.982
being married is hard.

603
00:51:11.736 --> 00:51:14.447
You get on
each other's nerves. and...

604
00:51:15.406 --> 00:51:19.285
you worry about
reaching a day where...

605
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:22.914
one of us will say
the wrong thing. and...

606
00:51:28.544 --> 00:51:31.964
sometimes I have
these fantasies...

607
00:51:34.383 --> 00:51:36.010
...where I beat him to it.

608
00:51:37.512 --> 00:51:38.596
Like...

609
00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:42.099
before he can hurt me.

610
00:51:45.269 --> 00:51:48.481
Like. maybe when
he's in the shower.

611
00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:53.236
I just take a knife and...

612
00:51:59.867 --> 00:52:00.952
Hey...

613
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.288
maybe you can help me.

614
00:52:06.541 --> 00:52:07.625
Could you?

615
00:52:09.627 --> 00:52:13.714
Maybe you could sneak me away
before things get really bad.

616
00:52:15.883 --> 00:52:17.260
Maybe you could fix it.

617
00:52:21.722 --> 00:52:24.308
I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm just--
I'm just here to sell the house.

618
00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:31.566
Of course.

619
00:52:32.316 --> 00:52:34.694
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to deal.

620
00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:39.740
I'm sorry.
I hope I didn't frighten you.

621
00:53:22.909 --> 00:53:24.327
After you.

622
00:54:24.136 --> 00:54:27.223
"Looking for someone

623
00:54:27.223 --> 00:54:30.393
with special abilities.

624
00:54:34.689 --> 00:54:38.275
A... psychic."

625
00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:10.933
Are you Claire?

626
00:55:19.483 --> 00:55:22.236
Thank you so much
for responding. Uh...

627
00:55:23.821 --> 00:55:26.949
So. uh. where do we start?

628
00:55:28.868 --> 00:55:30.995
You've done this before. right?

629
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:34.040
I don't normally
meet up like this.

630
00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:36.751
Oh.

631
00:55:37.793 --> 00:55:39.378
How do you normally do it?

632
00:55:39.378 --> 00:55:41.130
I don't.

633
00:55:50.014 --> 00:55:53.100
So-- so you're psychic. right?

634
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.477
Medium.

635
00:55:56.187 --> 00:55:57.354
What's that?

636
00:55:57.354 --> 00:55:59.023
You don't know what a medium is?

637
00:55:59.023 --> 00:56:01.358
Something between
a small and large?

638
00:56:03.027 --> 00:56:04.862
A psychic can't do what I do.

639
00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:09.825
Look.
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

640
00:56:09.825 --> 00:56:11.535
And just so you know.
you're talking to

641
00:56:11.535 --> 00:56:13.162
a Willy Wonka-caliber
sugarcoater over here.

642
00:56:13.162 --> 00:56:14.580
Sugar?

643
00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:29.678
Uh...

644
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:32.973
...I have a house
I'm trying to sell.

645
00:56:32.973 --> 00:56:35.351
and I need to come to
some type of agreement with...

646
00:56:37.228 --> 00:56:38.687
the-- the current occupants.

647
00:56:40.356 --> 00:56:43.776
I don't do eviction notices.
I'm not a public notary.

648
00:56:44.318 --> 00:56:45.861
Notary public.

649
00:56:45.861 --> 00:56:47.738
Okay. Dad.

650
00:56:49.657 --> 00:56:52.827
Uh-- uh.
this house has a-- a bit of...

651
00:56:52.827 --> 00:56:54.745
...history.

652
00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:57.623
Uh. apparently anyone
that moves in kind of sort of

653
00:56:58.332 --> 00:56:59.834
ends up dead.

654
00:56:59.834 --> 00:57:01.335
Kinda sorta dead?

655
00:57:02.628 --> 00:57:04.171
Well. more like murdered.

656
00:57:04.171 --> 00:57:05.923
Kill or be killed.

657
00:57:05.923 --> 00:57:07.341
Or you kill yourself.

658
00:57:08.551 --> 00:57:09.969
That is a problem.

659
00:57:09.969 --> 00:57:11.345
Yeah.

660
00:57:12.513 --> 00:57:13.597
Uh...

661
00:57:14.723 --> 00:57:16.976
apparently this has been
going back a while. and...

662
00:57:17.893 --> 00:57:21.272
- Could you maybe not do that?
- No one tells me what to do.

663
00:57:21.272 --> 00:57:24.400
I-- I-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Please. Please.

664
00:57:28.863 --> 00:57:30.781
I'm occasionally disingenuous.

665
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:33.325
Occasionally very. very often.

666
00:57:33.325 --> 00:57:36.245
But not now. I need you.

667
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:41.876
Please. Can you help me?

668
00:57:42.835 --> 00:57:45.379
I didn't tell you
how ugly that tie is.

669
00:57:46.755 --> 00:57:47.965
Clients like it.

670
00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:49.466
I thought the clients were dead.

671
00:57:49.466 --> 00:57:51.051
Only some are dead.

672
00:57:51.051 --> 00:57:52.178
I think.

673
00:57:54.555 --> 00:57:55.723
How much will you pay me?

674
00:57:57.892 --> 00:58:00.769
Well. I'll have you know I'm
expecting a bit of a windfall

675
00:58:00.769 --> 00:58:02.438
after this transaction.

676
00:58:02.438 --> 00:58:04.273
This is a freebie?

677
00:58:04.273 --> 00:58:06.358
I'll make sure that
you're taken care of.

678
00:58:06.358 --> 00:58:08.110
I may be full of shit
with my customers.

679
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:09.570
but ask anyone
I've ever worked for.

680
00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:11.155
I will die for you
in the foxhole.

681
00:58:15.367 --> 00:58:16.869
I don't even know why I'm here.

682
00:58:18.871 --> 00:58:22.041
To be honest. it's been a while

683
00:58:22.041 --> 00:58:24.210
since I've done
something like this.

684
00:58:25.085 --> 00:58:27.671
But you can do it.

685
00:58:31.133 --> 00:58:32.927
Growing up. I could see things.

686
00:58:34.386 --> 00:58:37.723
Hear thoughts
that used to be there.

687
00:58:42.937 --> 00:58:46.607
Sometimes the things were evil.

688
00:58:51.195 --> 00:58:52.321
What'd you do?

689
00:58:55.407 --> 00:58:56.700
Burned the fucker down.

690
00:59:00.579 --> 00:59:01.705
Kidding.

691
00:59:03.624 --> 00:59:04.708
Look...

692
00:59:05.334 --> 00:59:07.628
if you pay attention.

693
00:59:07.628 --> 00:59:09.004
open up to them...

694
00:59:10.172 --> 00:59:11.465
they will talk back.

695
00:59:12.967 --> 00:59:14.218
If you believe.

696
00:59:15.261 --> 00:59:16.762
you can get them to come out.

697
00:59:18.097 --> 00:59:19.723
Maybe even get them to leave.

698
00:59:23.018 --> 00:59:24.937
But having gasoline on hand

699
00:59:24.937 --> 00:59:26.689
probably isn't
a bad idea either.

700
00:59:36.115 --> 00:59:37.616
Fuck it. I'll help you.

701
00:59:38.993 --> 00:59:41.578
Thank you. Thank you so much.

702
00:59:41.578 --> 00:59:43.163
I will do
whatever I can for you.

703
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:45.708
Just lose the tie.

704
01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:40.137
Hi. Claire.

705
01:00:42.056 --> 01:00:43.140
This it?

706
01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:45.934
Yeah. Come on in.

707
01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:59.823
What. uh-- Do you see anything?

708
01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:04.620
Yeah.
some brain matter right there.

709
01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:24.098
What's with the crosses?

710
01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:28.685
Uh. I don't know.
I thought maybe

711
01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:31.230
"the power of Christ
compels you" or something.

712
01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:36.819
Just trying to help.

713
01:01:40.489 --> 01:01:41.657
What's the activity?

714
01:01:43.075 --> 01:01:46.036
Knocking. hearing voices.
moving furniture?

715
01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:47.955
All of the above.

716
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:50.165
Apparitions?

717
01:01:52.084 --> 01:01:53.919
Have you seen ghosts?

718
01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:56.839
- Oh. yeah.
- Where?

719
01:01:56.839 --> 01:01:57.965
All over.

720
01:01:58.465 --> 01:02:01.385
Kitchen. hallways. bedroom.

721
01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.221
Let's see the bedroom.

722
01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:13.730
Ridiculous.

723
01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:22.114
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

724
01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:41.592
You're right. though.
Something is--

725
01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:58.734
Yeah. that's right. be-yotch!

726
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:00.736
Door stopper.

727
01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:05.115
We'll do it in here.

728
01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:06.492
Tonight.

729
01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:41.944
You think I should
turn off the central air?

730
01:03:41.944 --> 01:03:43.403
It does provide
a lot of movement.

731
01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:44.988
Stop.

732
01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:47.241
No one wants to hear
about central air.

733
01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.243
Okay.

734
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:51.495
Oh!

735
01:03:58.043 --> 01:03:59.461
What's that?

736
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:00.879
Garlic.

737
01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.466
Do you have
fucking vampires too?

738
01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:09.012
Sorry. first séance.

739
01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:14.601
- Hands on the table. bro.
- All right. okay.

740
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.275
Close your eyes.

741
01:04:24.695 --> 01:04:26.363
No peeking.

742
01:04:36.248 --> 01:04:37.332
I'm listening.

743
01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:45.716
We know you're here.

744
01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:49.344
Speak to me.

745
01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:52.222
We're here to help.

746
01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:54.891
I'm here to help.

747
01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:02.774
Show yourself.

748
01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:06.528
Show yourself.

749
01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:20.125
There's someone here.

750
01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:23.211
Who?

751
01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:25.213
Who's here?

752
01:05:41.188 --> 01:05:42.314
Claire?

753
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.444
Claire?

754
01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:51.907
Hello?

755
01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.825
Claire?

756
01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:53.260
Who are you?

757
01:06:54.261 --> 01:06:58.014
Scarlett.

758
01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:05.397
Sc-- Sc-- Scar-- Scarlett.
you-- you have to leave.

759
01:07:05.397 --> 01:07:07.023
This is not your house anymore.

760
01:07:25.292 --> 01:07:27.002
Claire. get rid of her!

761
01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.567
This is not your house.

762
01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:57.115
We are many.

763
01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:01.661
You are none.

764
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:09.836
Claire. snap out of it.

765
01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:15.175
Second bedroom.

766
01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:19.888
Sorry.

767
01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:47.499
The very first murders
were in this room.

768
01:08:52.629 --> 01:08:53.964
Two little girls.

769
01:08:57.843 --> 01:08:59.010
By their own father.

770
01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.683
Never allowed to grow up.

771
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:09.563
Doomed to this place.

772
01:09:12.274 --> 01:09:15.068
Everyone who lives here
made to suffer as they did.

773
01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:19.072
What about Scarlett?

774
01:09:22.409 --> 01:09:23.994
Scarlett was the last.

775
01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:26.329
And the angriest.

776
01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:35.881
It needs more ghosts.

777
01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:39.509
Yeah. but I need to
get rid of the ghosts.

778
01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:44.472
This house...

779
01:09:45.724 --> 01:09:46.850
likes you.

780
01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:50.729
Knows you'll feed it.

781
01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:54.190
Me? Why me?

782
01:09:56.151 --> 01:09:57.235
Because...

783
01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:01.656
you only care about yourself.

784
01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:06.036
Well. that's a load of crap.

785
01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:09.331
I care about lots of stuff.
I care about people.

786
01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:11.917
But right now. you know
what I really care about?

787
01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:13.793
Selling this goddamn house.

788
01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:17.797
No. stop it! Stop that!

789
01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:29.809
No! No!

790
01:10:31.186 --> 01:10:33.563
No. Claire!

791
01:10:34.356 --> 01:10:36.858
Claire! Claire. stop it!

792
01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:39.235
This door is probably
very expensive.

793
01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:49.204
Claire! Stop being possessed!
It's a total cliché!

794
01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.916
Claire. stop!

795
01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.042
Mason?

796
01:10:56.044 --> 01:10:58.004
Mason. they're gone.
but only for a moment.

797
01:10:58.004 --> 01:10:59.965
We have to go now.

798
01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:05.512
I'm sorry.

799
01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:10.141
They don't want me to leave.

800
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.685
We have to go
before they're back.

801
01:11:15.981 --> 01:11:17.649
It-- it's okay. It's okay.

802
01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:24.781
Ooh!

803
01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:35.583
Oh. shit!

804
01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:44.342
Uh... oh. man.

805
01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:47.095
Uh... think. think. think. Um...

806
01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:51.599
okay. you're a murderer. and
you need to hide a body. Uh...

807
01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:54.269
No. No. You're not a murderer.

808
01:11:54.269 --> 01:11:56.187
This was an accident.
It was clearly an accident.

809
01:11:56.187 --> 01:11:59.315
Just call 911
and tell 'em what happened.

810
01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:03.069
You just picked up a young girl
you met on Craigslist.

811
01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:06.197
and you brought her over
to your home

812
01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:08.116
in the middle of nowhere.

813
01:12:08.116 --> 01:12:09.784
and she wound up dead
in the bedroom.

814
01:12:12.037 --> 01:12:13.955
Okay.
you're definitely a murderer.

815
01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:16.833
and you need to hide the body
while you sort things out.

816
01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.126
Think!

817
01:14:15.285 --> 01:14:16.369
Okay.

818
01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:19.497
Let's just get this to the car.
It's just clothes.

819
01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:21.791
It's fine. No one's gonna see.

820
01:14:24.544 --> 01:14:25.628
One...

821
01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.048
two...

822
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.760
three.

823
01:14:36.723 --> 01:14:38.224
Who is it?

824
01:14:38.224 --> 01:14:40.602
Police. Open up.

825
01:14:51.946 --> 01:14:54.157
Okay. Okay.

826
01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:55.366
I deserve it.

827
01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:02.790
Aw. McGinness. Mr.

828
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:06.002
I'm just fuckin' with you.
Good morning!

829
01:15:07.754 --> 01:15:09.923
Oh. uh. g-- good morning.
What are you. um--

830
01:15:13.051 --> 01:15:14.802
What do I owe the pleasure?

831
01:15:15.929 --> 01:15:19.557
Well. I thought I'd drop in
on my way to the office.

832
01:15:21.476 --> 01:15:23.770
How's everything going?

833
01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:29.651
Progressing.

834
01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.111
Great.

835
01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:35.073
Let's have a gander.

836
01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.301
Well. this is a new one.

837
01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:58.554
You a religious man. McGinness?

838
01:15:59.097 --> 01:16:01.391
Uh. yes. Yes.

839
01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:05.061
Actually. I know. you know.
this being the Bible Belt

840
01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:07.522
and all. that this
might look attractive

841
01:16:07.522 --> 01:16:10.692
to the. uh. evangelical crowd.

842
01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:15.655
Fascinating.

843
01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:23.496
Well. I'm glad you're thinking
outside of the box.

844
01:16:23.496 --> 01:16:27.083
but maybe spread some of those
crosses around or something.

845
01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.835
Of course.

846
01:16:28.835 --> 01:16:30.378
Uh. Mr. Bendt. can I get you
anything to drink?

847
01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:31.421
A water?

848
01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.052
Wait.

849
01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:42.140
There's a plumbing issue.

850
01:16:44.642 --> 01:16:48.354
Did I ever tell you how I came
into possession of this house?

851
01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.566
You...

852
01:16:52.442 --> 01:16:53.776
lost a bet?

853
01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:57.739
Precisely.

854
01:17:00.408 --> 01:17:04.579
Well. I guess
you ruined my favorite story.

855
01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.205
Wait. the--

856
01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:27.310
Well. let's go look
at the old lady's room.

857
01:17:36.361 --> 01:17:39.781
What in God's grand buck
happened in here?

858
01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:47.705
Oh. uh. our sense of smell
is tied to memory.

859
01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:51.417
and. uh. buyers.
they love a scent

860
01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:53.252
that takes them back in time.
mm-hmm.

861
01:17:55.963 --> 01:18:00.093
Tell me. you seen
any weird shit in here?

862
01:18:00.093 --> 01:18:01.469
Ghosts?

863
01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:06.015
Me?

864
01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.226
I've never seen it.

865
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:12.688
Every time I come here.
it's the same ugly old house.

866
01:18:14.524 --> 01:18:16.901
But that's what
the people always say.

867
01:18:17.944 --> 01:18:19.070
Voices.

868
01:18:19.654 --> 01:18:20.822
Weird shit.

869
01:18:21.656 --> 01:18:24.158
Too many deaths in here.
I guess.

870
01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:27.412
But you can't blame them.

871
01:18:28.329 --> 01:18:30.081
Did you know that every time

872
01:18:30.081 --> 01:18:33.334
there's more than one person
dwelling in this house.

873
01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:36.796
one of them goes crazy
and murders the others?

874
01:18:38.506 --> 01:18:41.717
Wives. kids... killed.

875
01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:45.346
Isn't that something?

876
01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:50.518
You seen any murders
in this house. McGinness?

877
01:18:59.152 --> 01:19:03.614
Don't be such a doof.
It's all just a big coincidence.

878
01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:05.491
Come on. let's go.

879
01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:13.374
Well. nobody's died here yet.

880
01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:15.877
so everything looks
peachy keen to me.

881
01:19:16.461 --> 01:19:19.130
Just do me a favor
and clean out all that

882
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:21.674
sex orgy candle stuff

883
01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:23.634
before your next prospect.

884
01:19:24.177 --> 01:19:26.012
Certainly. Clear it out today.

885
01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:28.389
And thank you for stopping by.

886
01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:30.141
I'll make sure
to keep you updated.

887
01:19:32.059 --> 01:19:35.730
Actually. let me take
a look in here really quick.

888
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:38.483
Oh. no.
This room is fine. Trust me.

889
01:19:38.483 --> 01:19:41.486
Oh. yeah? Then let me see it.

890
01:19:44.614 --> 01:19:46.491
Y-- You don't need
to go in there.

891
01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:48.367
And why is that?

892
01:19:51.579 --> 01:19:52.663
Ghosts?

893
01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:56.000
Jesus H. Christ.

894
01:20:00.421 --> 01:20:01.631
Good night.

895
01:20:03.257 --> 01:20:05.676
Smells like
something died in here.

896
01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:13.768
This yours?

897
01:20:20.775 --> 01:20:21.943
What's in this?

898
01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:27.198
Dirty laundry.

899
01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:55.059
You're into
some weird shit. McGinness.

900
01:20:56.561 --> 01:20:59.605
But actually.
you're the kind of person

901
01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:01.691
I've needed all along.

902
01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.571
Clean this place up.
for Christ's sake.

903
01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:09.448
And get some more
bodies in here.

904
01:21:09.448 --> 01:21:11.534
The place
ain't gonna sell itself.

905
01:27:34.208 --> 01:27:35.876
Last chance. Mason.

906
01:28:55.956 --> 01:28:57.499
Hey! Is this...

907
01:28:57.499 --> 01:28:59.668
Be gone! Gone with you. demon!

908
01:29:01.545 --> 01:29:02.629
...sycamore?

909
01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:07.092
Yeah. maybe. What's it to you?

910
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:12.681
It's very nice.

911
01:29:17.019 --> 01:29:18.145
Let me see
the back of your head.

912
01:29:19.605 --> 01:29:20.647
Okay.

913
01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:22.441
Why. is there a leaf
or something?

914
01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:32.534
Um...

915
01:29:32.534 --> 01:29:33.660
...you busy cleaning?

916
01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:35.996
I'd love to check out
the inside.

917
01:30:00.354 --> 01:30:03.232
Well. this is it.
Another sausage is made.

918
01:30:04.525 --> 01:30:06.110
Where the bodies are buried.

919
01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:17.329
Makes for a good spot
to incinerate one's problems.

920
01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.292
Probably should have
thought of that.

921
01:30:36.473 --> 01:30:39.309
I've read that these grounds
have a bit of a sordid history.

922
01:30:40.644 --> 01:30:42.271
It's a bit of an understatement.

923
01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:46.567
I'm into it.

924
01:30:47.401 --> 01:30:48.735
Little added character.

925
01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:51.780
- Makes for some fun stories.
- Wait!

926
01:30:58.996 --> 01:31:00.205
And maybe best of all...

927
01:31:01.248 --> 01:31:02.541
makes for low property value.

928
01:31:05.377 --> 01:31:06.753
Dude. come on.

929
01:31:06.753 --> 01:31:08.297
Let's drop the charade.
all right?

930
01:31:08.297 --> 01:31:09.965
- I gotta get back to--
- I'll take it.

931
01:31:11.842 --> 01:31:12.968
What?

932
01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:14.887
I'll take it.

933
01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:19.391
You mean. buy it?

934
01:31:19.892 --> 01:31:21.643
You want to? Just like that?

935
01:31:23.604 --> 01:31:25.230
I've already seen the specs.

936
01:31:25.898 --> 01:31:27.232
I already know the history.

937
01:31:28.192 --> 01:31:29.610
Look. I definitely
didn't come out here

938
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:30.944
to lose it to another buyer.

939
01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:34.072
Why. is there anything else
I should know?

940
01:31:40.454 --> 01:31:42.372
Single guy like you? You?

941
01:31:42.372 --> 01:31:43.582
What was your name again?

942
01:31:43.582 --> 01:31:44.625
You're single. right?

943
01:31:44.625 --> 01:31:46.043
Yeah. but. uh...

944
01:31:47.044 --> 01:31:48.128
It's Jim.

945
01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:51.006
Jim. Jimmy.

946
01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:53.050
Sir James.

947
01:31:53.675 --> 01:31:56.845
You know. Jim.
a house is more than a home.

948
01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:59.598
It is a place where we forge
our own trails.

949
01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:01.934
We begin our own adventures.

950
01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:07.898
{\an8}Thank you.

951
01:32:07.898 --> 01:32:09.107
{\an8}- Thank you.
- Take care.

952
01:32:09.107 --> 01:32:10.150
{\an8}It was really great meeting you.

953
01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:11.401
{\an8}Aw. you too. man.

954
01:32:39.846 --> 01:32:43.517
And you should have
no misgivings depositing it.

955
01:32:43.517 --> 01:32:45.310
- Thank you so much.
- Partner.

956
01:32:49.064 --> 01:32:51.024
Oh. no. thank you.

957
01:32:51.024 --> 01:32:53.110
You've done the unthinkable.

958
01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:57.948
And as an extra special token
of my appreciation...

959
01:33:01.827 --> 01:33:04.204
- I don't smoke. though.
- You never know.

960
01:33:04.204 --> 01:33:06.790
You could come across
some fuzzy paperwork

961
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:09.293
that probably should be burned.

962
01:33:11.753 --> 01:33:13.380
So. what's next?

963
01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:16.800
Next? Oh. new challenges await.

964
01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.637
Unique properties to sell.
A robust rental market.

965
01:33:20.637 --> 01:33:23.974
The trappings of office.
fame and politics.

966
01:33:24.725 --> 01:33:25.809
Get this.

967
01:33:26.518 --> 01:33:28.812
Cindy's stapler's gone missing.

968
01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:31.898
No. no. I mean.
what is next for--

969
01:33:32.858 --> 01:33:34.276
You know what? Forget it.

970
01:33:34.276 --> 01:33:36.320
Oh. buck up. boy.

971
01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:38.989
Don't you want to hear
how I lost that bet?

972
01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:42.367
Sure.

973
01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:44.661
Most fucked-up poker game
I ever played.

974
01:33:45.162 --> 01:33:47.914
The winner wins
the deed to the house.

975
01:33:48.665 --> 01:33:50.208
What I didn't know. though.

976
01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:52.544
was that he lost the game
on purpose.

977
01:33:54.129 --> 01:33:56.423
On account
of the deed being cursed.

978
01:33:59.009 --> 01:34:00.093
You see?

979
01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:04.973
Whoever owns the deed
owes the house lives.

980
01:34:05.766 --> 01:34:07.851
Remember those nightmares
you had?

981
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.688
Well. every time
the house was hungry.

982
01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:13.273
I had them. too.

983
01:34:13.857 --> 01:34:16.193
Until I could give it
to someone to take.

984
01:34:16.193 --> 01:34:17.944
so to speak.

985
01:34:17.944 --> 01:34:21.031
Usually a random.
overconfident salesman would do.

986
01:34:22.324 --> 01:34:24.034
Until you came along.

987
01:34:24.034 --> 01:34:25.619
And wouldn't you know it?

988
01:34:26.078 --> 01:34:29.664
You actually sold the damn thing
and escaped with your life.

989
01:34:30.374 --> 01:34:33.460
Now. that poor sap has the deed.

990
01:34:34.002 --> 01:34:37.005
And he'll pass it
to someone else when he dies.

991
01:35:38.608 --> 01:35:39.860
Hello?

992
01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:42.028
Hey. Mase. It's Jim.

993
01:35:42.654 --> 01:35:44.698
Oh.
Hey. how are you?

994
01:35:44.698 --> 01:35:47.534
Uh...
uh. everything adequate?

995
01:35:47.993 --> 01:35:49.995
Yeah. Adequate.

996
01:35:50.537 --> 01:35:53.957
Uh. bit of a killer headache
the last couple days.

997
01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:56.543
Oh. Not feeling well?

998
01:35:56.543 --> 01:35:58.336
No. I'm sure it's nothing.

999
01:35:58.336 --> 01:36:00.213
But I am calling
because there's a little issue.

1000
01:36:04.009 --> 01:36:05.802
Okay. Jim.
I'm going to be honest with you.

1001
01:36:05.802 --> 01:36:09.890
Uh. you might need to do
some exorcising.

1002
01:36:12.476 --> 01:36:13.727
Exorcising?

1003
01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:15.854
Yeah. Candles.

1004
01:36:15.854 --> 01:36:17.439
And you want to get
a really good priest

1005
01:36:17.439 --> 01:36:19.232
because mediums
might not be as effective.

1006
01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:25.405
Okay.

1007
01:36:25.405 --> 01:36:27.032
I haven't the faintest clue
what you're talking about.

1008
01:36:27.032 --> 01:36:29.075
This is about the bedrooms?

1009
01:36:31.328 --> 01:36:32.829
Yes. Yes. it is.

1010
01:36:34.039 --> 01:36:35.707
Yeah. well. I'm thinking

1011
01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:37.501
there might be
an infestation upstairs.

1012
01:36:37.501 --> 01:36:39.002
You know. my daughter's heard

1013
01:36:39.002 --> 01:36:40.545
a lot of scratching
on the walls.

1014
01:36:40.545 --> 01:36:41.630
<i>And...</i>

1015
01:36:41.630 --> 01:36:43.256
Just the other night.

1016
01:36:43.256 --> 01:36:44.591
I started to hear it
in the big bedroom. too.

1017
01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.512
Daughter? Your-- your daughter?

1018
01:36:49.137 --> 01:36:50.889
I know this happens sometimes.

1019
01:36:50.889 --> 01:36:54.017
But I don't know
the first person to call

1020
01:36:54.017 --> 01:36:55.936
about something like that. so...

1021
01:36:55.936 --> 01:36:58.104
Wait. wait. I'm sorry.
Your family?

1022
01:36:58.104 --> 01:37:00.815
You-- you have a family living
with you at that house?

1023
01:37:01.483 --> 01:37:04.152
Yeah.
My daughter's here with me.

1024
01:37:04.152 --> 01:37:05.946
But. uh. you know...

1025
01:37:05.946 --> 01:37:07.239
...I don't think she knows
a contractor. either.

1026
01:37:07.239 --> 01:37:08.532
She's seven.

1027
01:37:14.663 --> 01:37:16.414
Uh. yeah. I will. uh--

1028
01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:17.541
I'll think about it.

1029
01:37:20.794 --> 01:37:22.337
Yeah. well.

1030
01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:25.382
We might switch rooms anyway.

1031
01:37:25.966 --> 01:37:28.593
She couldn't get a wink of sleep
in there the last couple nights.

1032
01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:30.428
Monster under the bed. you know?

1033
01:37:30.428 --> 01:37:32.514
Hey!

1034
01:37:32.514 --> 01:37:33.682
Knock it off!

1035
01:37:37.102 --> 01:37:38.270
Oh. shit.

1036
01:37:39.813 --> 01:37:41.856
Sorry.

1037
01:37:42.816 --> 01:37:45.402
It's the headache.

1038
01:37:47.404 --> 01:37:48.863
Mason? You still there?

1039
01:37:52.284 --> 01:37:54.953
Yes. Yeah. I'll--
I'll figure something out.

1040
01:37:57.038 --> 01:37:58.373
Great.

1041
01:37:58.373 --> 01:38:00.375
Um. appreciate it. Thanks.

1042
01:38:19.269 --> 01:38:21.313
Dad. can I sleep with you?

1043
01:38:22.314 --> 01:38:24.816
Why? It's time for bed.

1044
01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.444
But there's monsters.

1045
01:38:28.069 --> 01:38:30.447
There's no monsters.
No such thing.

1046
01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:33.116
Just try not to think about it.

1047
01:38:59.434 --> 01:39:00.894
<i>Hey. you've reached Jim Neal.</i>

1048
01:39:01.144 --> 01:39:02.771
<i>Can't get to my phone right
now.</i>

1049
01:39:02.771 --> 01:39:04.522
<i>but if you leave your name
and number.</i>

1050
01:39:04.522 --> 01:39:05.899
<i>I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.</i>

1051
01:39:05.899 --> 01:39:07.025
Shit!

1052
01:40:10.213 --> 01:40:12.257
Mr. Neal! Jim. hello!

1053
01:40:31.151 --> 01:40:32.235
Jim!

1054
01:40:33.153 --> 01:40:34.487
Hello. Jim! Come on!

1055
01:40:38.742 --> 01:40:39.826
Mason?

1056
01:40:43.496 --> 01:40:45.582
What-- what are you doing here?

1057
01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.335
Oh. uh. I just wanted to give
everything a once-over

1058
01:40:49.335 --> 01:40:52.839
for any. uh. quick fixes.
irregularities.

1059
01:40:52.839 --> 01:40:54.549
brain splatter. evidence.

1060
01:40:54.549 --> 01:40:57.343
Mason. what are you doing?
It's late.

1061
01:40:58.470 --> 01:41:00.054
Weird question.

1062
01:41:00.054 --> 01:41:01.514
Uh. are you having
any trouble sleeping.

1063
01:41:01.514 --> 01:41:03.183
or dangerous thoughts?

1064
01:41:03.183 --> 01:41:04.309
What are you doing right now?

1065
01:41:04.851 --> 01:41:06.519
I'm just having a...

1066
01:41:15.195 --> 01:41:16.279
...drink.

1067
01:41:19.032 --> 01:41:20.158
Where is your daughter?

1068
01:41:32.587 --> 01:41:35.590
- Are you okay?
- The closet!

1069
01:41:39.177 --> 01:41:40.678
What did you see? Who was it?

1070
01:41:40.678 --> 01:41:42.347
Mason. tell me what's going on.

1071
01:41:43.681 --> 01:41:45.725
Look. I want to purchase
your house back.

1072
01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:47.560
What?

1073
01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.937
This house. I want to buy it.

1074
01:41:49.437 --> 01:41:51.606
What are you. high?
You already sold it to me.

1075
01:41:51.606 --> 01:41:53.358
Semantics. just listen.

1076
01:41:53.358 --> 01:41:54.609
I want to take it
off your hands.

1077
01:41:54.609 --> 01:41:56.361
I'll pay you a healthy premium.

1078
01:41:56.361 --> 01:41:58.154
I got the money now.
I'm a partner.

1079
01:42:01.032 --> 01:42:02.325
Daddy.

1080
01:42:02.784 --> 01:42:04.244
Mason. get out of here!

1081
01:42:04.244 --> 01:42:06.162
Please. you have to
listen to me.

1082
01:42:06.162 --> 01:42:08.081
This house is a lemon. a dud.

1083
01:42:08.081 --> 01:42:10.083
I wasn't being honest with you.

1084
01:42:10.083 --> 01:42:11.501
That's my whole MO.

1085
01:42:11.501 --> 01:42:13.169
I'm not an honest person.

1086
01:42:13.169 --> 01:42:15.630
My entire career.
I bullied clients.

1087
01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:18.258
I cheated.
I brushed things under the rug.

1088
01:42:18.258 --> 01:42:20.009
Literally. like skull fragments.

1089
01:42:20.009 --> 01:42:21.803
evidence. the truth.

1090
01:42:22.804 --> 01:42:24.889
I was wrong
to have sold you this place.

1091
01:42:25.431 --> 01:42:26.724
You can't stay here.

1092
01:42:27.851 --> 01:42:29.519
Daddy!

1093
01:42:32.647 --> 01:42:33.731
Let's go.

1094
01:42:43.283 --> 01:42:44.367
Push. Jim!

1095
01:42:44.367 --> 01:42:46.494
I can't get it open!

1096
01:42:51.624 --> 01:42:53.001
Stop. Claire. it's me!

1097
01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.545
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1098
01:42:55.545 --> 01:42:56.671
This is all my fault.

1099
01:42:56.671 --> 01:42:58.256
You're just a kid.

1100
01:42:58.256 --> 01:42:59.507
I never should have
brought you here.

1101
01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:01.759
I-- I-- I promise
when this is over.

1102
01:43:01.759 --> 01:43:03.595
I will tell the police
everything.

1103
01:43:03.595 --> 01:43:05.263
And your family. your friends.
everyone will know.

1104
01:43:05.263 --> 01:43:06.472
so that they have peace.

1105
01:43:07.974 --> 01:43:10.351
You will have peace. I swear it.

1106
01:43:11.936 --> 01:43:13.187
No fingers crossed.

1107
01:43:31.205 --> 01:43:32.290
You're the best.

1108
01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.796
I'm not going to give
the whole closing speech again.

1109
01:43:38.796 --> 01:43:40.882
but this house
ain't a home no more.

1110
01:43:45.345 --> 01:43:46.888
Leaving already?

1111
01:43:47.347 --> 01:43:49.766
We're just trying to take them
to the next stage.

1112
01:43:49.766 --> 01:43:52.018
Endless possibilities.

1113
01:43:53.436 --> 01:43:56.147
They only try to mess with you.
They can't actually hurt you.

1114
01:43:56.898 --> 01:43:58.900
I think. Follow me.

1115
01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.716
Back door.

1116
01:44:36.437 --> 01:44:37.814
Dad!

1117
01:44:50.076 --> 01:44:51.619
Let him go.

1118
01:44:53.663 --> 01:44:55.540
{\an8}Low-life peddler.

1119
01:44:56.582 --> 01:44:59.335
{\an8}Two-bit confidence man.

1120
01:44:59.961 --> 01:45:02.547
{\an8}You're the sucker.

1121
01:45:03.464 --> 01:45:05.925
Nothing I haven't already heard
from my own family before.

1122
01:45:10.179 --> 01:45:12.015
Mason.

1123
01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:17.812
{\an8}Mason. I miss you.

1124
01:45:22.692 --> 01:45:23.776
You're not...

1125
01:45:24.902 --> 01:45:26.070
Mom.

1126
01:45:29.115 --> 01:45:31.909
{\an8}Don't let them put me
in a nursing home.

1127
01:45:32.994 --> 01:45:36.372
{\an8}Please. Mason. please.

1128
01:45:36.372 --> 01:45:38.624
{\an8}I just want to go home.

1129
01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:43.087
{\an8}You said you wouldn't leave me.

1130
01:45:43.796 --> 01:45:47.300
{\an8}You left me to die in there.

1131
01:45:53.056 --> 01:45:54.140
You're right. I did.

1132
01:45:56.684 --> 01:45:58.186
I could have helped
pay the mortgage.

1133
01:45:58.186 --> 01:46:00.063
I could have saved
your house. but...

1134
01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:05.526
instead I helped sell it
and pocketed the cash.

1135
01:46:11.282 --> 01:46:14.702
Every bad thing that has
ever been said about me

1136
01:46:14.702 --> 01:46:15.828
is true.

1137
01:46:17.413 --> 01:46:18.915
And I am so. so sorry.

1138
01:46:22.043 --> 01:46:23.211
So. we're gonna make a deal.

1139
01:46:25.004 --> 01:46:27.632
Me. instead of them.

1140
01:46:30.885 --> 01:46:34.263
{\an8}No deal.

1141
01:46:50.154 --> 01:46:52.698
{\an8}You'll never get rid of us.

1142
01:46:53.783 --> 01:46:56.828
{\an8}We are all.

1143
01:46:57.453 --> 01:46:59.747
And now. so am I.

1144
01:47:01.791 --> 01:47:03.960
Me. instead of them.

1145
01:47:05.294 --> 01:47:06.754
Take the deal.

1146
01:47:15.805 --> 01:47:17.098
Take the deal!

1147
01:47:25.356 --> 01:47:26.732
Jim! Jim!

1148
01:47:28.317 --> 01:47:30.319
Jim. Claire's body
is buried in Everpine.

1149
01:47:30.319 --> 01:47:31.946
just off Route 12.

1150
01:47:32.613 --> 01:47:33.781
Tell that to the police.

1151
01:47:34.365 --> 01:47:35.449
Tell them I did it.

1152
01:47:36.576 --> 01:47:38.953
Now. go. Now!

1153
01:50:18.404 --> 01:50:20.489
{\an8}So. this house
is a little older.

1154
01:50:20.489 --> 01:50:22.533
{\an8}but you do get a lot of
bang for your buck.

1155
01:50:23.826 --> 01:50:25.661
{\an8}It's four bed. one bath.

1156
01:50:26.787 --> 01:50:28.581
{\an8}18.096 square feet.

1157
01:50:33.294 --> 01:50:35.087
But it's pretty impressive.

1158
01:50:37.548 --> 01:50:39.842
It has some original features.

1159
01:50:39.842 --> 01:50:41.802
including a wood fire stove.

1160
01:50:43.596 --> 01:50:45.056
So. this could be your house.

1161
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:47.558
What are you gonna do now?

1162
01:50:49.894 --> 01:50:50.978
I don't know.

1163
01:50:51.979 --> 01:50:54.523
I guess I have eternity to watch
other people's mistakes.

1164
01:50:56.359 --> 01:50:57.693
This must be your hell.

1165
01:50:58.194 --> 01:50:59.653
How so?

1166
01:50:59.653 --> 01:51:01.781
All these people
and no one to sell to.

1167
01:51:05.951 --> 01:51:07.661
It's more peaceful
than I would have imagined.

1168
01:51:08.871 --> 01:51:10.748
Being a part of it
without all the stress.

1169
01:51:18.881 --> 01:51:20.966
Come on. it's not so bad. is it?

1170
01:51:20.966 --> 01:51:22.093
Bad?

1171
01:51:22.802 --> 01:51:24.011
It fucking sucks.

1172
01:51:27.306 --> 01:51:28.766
I can't even have any sugar.

1173
01:51:32.436 --> 01:51:34.522
It's better this way. Trust me.

1174
01:51:34.522 --> 01:51:35.648
How so?

1175
01:51:38.025 --> 01:51:39.485
Sugar will kill you.

1176
01:51:44.782 --> 01:51:45.950
