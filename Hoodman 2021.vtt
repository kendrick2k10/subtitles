16
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.073
- Miss Chandler. you're in Mercy Hospital.

17
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.433
You've been in an accident.

18
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.820
It's okay. You've suffered
some nasty head bangs.

19
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.530
But you're gonna be fine.

20
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.603
- Where's my baby?

21
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.063
Joshua. where's Joshua?

22
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.340
- Miss Chandler. the baby
did not survive the accident.

23
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.970
I'm sorry.
(somber music)

24
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.571
- What? No. that's not possible.

25
00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:46.800
He was in a car seat. He's
okay. he's gonna be okay.

26
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.617
I have to get help. please. Please help!

27
00:03:49.617 --> 00:03:50.948
Let me go. please!

28
00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:52.865
- You're gonna be okay.

29
00:03:54.513 --> 00:03:56.680
- Isoflurane to calm her. please.

30
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.513
- [Nurse] Yes. Doctor.

31
00:03:57.513 --> 00:04:00.487
- Miss Chandler. you're lucky to be alive.

32
00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:04.280
- I need to see Joshua.
I need to see my baby.

33
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.940
- We're gonna keep you here overnight

34
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.070
for some X-rays and a CT scan.

35
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.420

(Chandler sobs)

37
00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:21.826
- Hi. sweetie.

38
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.073
Missy wrote you this note.

39
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.800
We want you to come home.

40
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.140
- [Missy] Dear Arry. we're
going to take care of you.

41
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.920
Come back home and stay with
us so you'll get better.

42
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.150
Love. Missy.

43
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.690
- You don't need to make
a decision right now.

44
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.343
Just give it time. You
have a lot to deal with.

45
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.320
- We'll stay right here with you.

46
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.153
- [Ariana] No.

47
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.943
- Give her time.

48
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.310
She's in shock.

49
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.360
She just needs to be with herself.

50
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.010
- No. I wanna stay here with her.

51
00:04:55.414 --> 00:04:57.604
- Come on. let's go.

52
00:04:57.604 --> 00:05:00.610
We'll check in on her tomorrow.

53
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.510
She needs to rest.

54
00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.880

(knocks)

57
00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:18.337
- Excuse me. Mrs. Chandler?

58
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.913
I'm Detective Lenny Briggs. Madison PD.

59
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.620
Are you feeling up to
answering a few questions?

60
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.980
- She's not. Mr. Briggs.
She's recovering from trauma.

61
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.883
- I'll be brief.

62
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.675
- Keep it very brief. Mr. Briggs.

63
00:05:33.675 --> 00:05:36.293
- (sighs) I'm sorry about
your loss. Mrs. Chandler.

64
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.570
- I need to find Joshua.
I need to find my son.

65
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.303
- I know about the loss of your husband.

66
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.433
And now this. I realize this
is a very difficult time.

67
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.470
But when someone's deceased
as a result of an accident.

68
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.820
we need to determine the-
- Joshua isn't dead.

69
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.443
- Do you remember what happened?

70
00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:02.930
- I was driving my car.
- Just you and the child?

71
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.250
- Yes.

72
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.807
- Were you taking any drugs or alcohol?

73
00:06:06.807 --> 00:06:08.220
- No.

74
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.913
- Sorry. I... I had to ask.

75
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.290
Given your history.

76
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.230
- There was a man. in the road.

77
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.433
I had to slam on my brakes
to avoid hitting him.

78
00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:21.447
- What did the man look like?

79
00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.660
- I. I couldn't get a good look at him.

80
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.080
but he had on a hood or a hoodie?

81
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.823
No. no. it was a robe.
It was a black robe.

82
00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:34.640
- You saw a man standing
in the middle of the road

83
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.720
wearing a black robe?

84
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.700
- I mean. I don't know who or what it was.

85
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.483
but it looked like a man.

86
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.810
I think I hit him.

87
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.010
- Mrs. Chandler. I was on
the scene about an hour

88
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.253
after it happened and
there was no other body.

89
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.080
Except for your son.

90
00:06:57.274 --> 00:06:59.765
- My son?

91
00:06:59.765 --> 00:07:02.175
No. it's not my son.

92
00:07:02.175 --> 00:07:04.297
(sobs) You didn't find my son.

93
00:07:04.297 --> 00:07:05.333
- I'm so sorry.

94
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.335
- That's enough. Out.

95
00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:13.335
(Ariana sobs)
(Lenny sighs)

96
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.163

97
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.437

(indistinct whispering)

99
00:08:12.467 --> 00:08:17.467
(suspenseful music)
(indistinct whispering)

100
00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:24.651

101
00:08:29.288 --> 00:08:31.757
(knocks)

102
00:08:31.757 --> 00:08:32.924
- God. Tawnie.

103
00:08:35.267 --> 00:08:37.397
- God. you look like shit.

104
00:08:37.397 --> 00:08:38.747
and you're still beautiful.

105
00:08:39.776 --> 00:08:40.984
I'm jealous.

106
00:08:40.984 --> 00:08:42.380
- What time is it?

107
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.820
- After three in the morning.

108
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.740
- [Ariana] How'd you get in?

109
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.776
- Snuck up the back stairs.

110
00:08:47.776 --> 00:08:50.609
(Ariana chuckles)

111
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.600
Man. what the hell happened?

112
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.000
- I wrecked my car. I...

113
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.300
They say that Joshua's dead.

114
00:09:01.515 --> 00:09:02.348
- What?

115
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:07.043
God. Ari. I'm... I'm so sorry.

116
00:09:07.043 --> 00:09:07.910
- And there was this man.

117
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.500
He stepped out in front of the car.

118
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.560
I swerved to avoid hitting him. I...

119
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.540
I might have killed him.

120
00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.900
- You're sure?

121
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.830
- Yes. I...

122
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.060
I think so.

123
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.670
- Look. you've been under
a lot of stress. I mean.

124
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.010
Cody's suicide. now this?

125
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.483
- I'm not making this up.

126
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.273
Joshua isn't dead. Someone took him.

127
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.203
- Whatever happened.
I'm here for you. okay?

128
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.223
- Yeah.

129
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.030
I know.

130
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.644
- So when are you bustin' outta here?

131
00:09:42.644 --> 00:09:44.250
(Ariana sighs)

132
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.863
- I'm getting released tomorrow.

133
00:09:47.051 --> 00:09:49.410
I'm going back to my parents' house.

134
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.480
- That's gonna be rough.

135
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.623
- It's only until I get back on my feet.

136
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.630
Till I find Joshua.

137
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.912
(Tawnie sighs)

138
00:09:57.912 --> 00:09:59.620
I have to move out of my place.

139
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.980
Do you think you could help me?

140
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.410
- Yes. of course. Just call me. okay?

141
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.243
- I will.

142
00:10:06.741 --> 00:10:08.069
Thanks.

143
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:10.652
(somber music)

144
00:10:29.334 --> 00:10:30.928
- Come on. Let's get your stuff.

145
00:10:30.928 --> 00:10:31.761
- Yeah.

146
00:11:11.104 --> 00:11:13.604
(birds tweet)

147
00:11:32.289 --> 00:11:35.372
I can't believe I'm moving back here.

148
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.440
- You can always come live with me.

149
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.873
I'm only with Gabe.

150
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:42.711
It's no fun being a single parent.

151
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:46.274
- I'll be okay.

152
00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:50.197
- Well. the invitation always stands.

153
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.370
Gabe loves you.

154
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.870
- I know. I just want my parents to know

155
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.430
I'm not rejecting their offer to help.

156
00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.623
And it means a lot to Missy.

157
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.950
- No worries.

158
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.680
Come on. Let's get these
boxes out of the car.

159
00:12:11.265 --> 00:12:13.848
(Ariana sighs)

160
00:12:17.502 --> 00:12:20.252
(car door slams)

161
00:12:27.354 --> 00:12:29.687
Somebody's happy to see you.

162
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.490
- You're room is just as you left it.

163
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.340
We didn't change a thing.

164
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:36.440
- Thanks. Mom.

165
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.640
- It'll be nice to have
you back home again.

166
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.250
- Where's Dad?

167
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.333
- He's working.

168
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.610
As usual.

169
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:48.070
- Speaking of work. I gotta get back.

170
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.370
- Thanks for all your help. Tawnie.

171
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.193
- Anything for you. girlfriend.

172
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.870
- Well. don't just stand there. squirt.

173
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.623
Grab a box and let's go.

174
00:13:00.623 --> 00:13:02.510
- [Missy] (chuckles) Okay.

175
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.060
- Do you need help with that?

176
00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.060
- [Missy] We got it.

177
00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:29.610
- You happy to have me back?

178
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.484
- Yeah. I'm really happy
to have you back. Ari.

179
00:13:32.484 --> 00:13:35.317
(Ariana chuckles)

180
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.943
- Just like Mom said.

181
00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.473
Just like I left it.

182
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.880
- Mommy said that Cody
killed himself after the war

183
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.250
because he saw bad
things when he was there.

184
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.810
- Missy!

185
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.030
Downstairs!

186
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.863
Now!

187
00:13:54.863 --> 00:13:56.665
- I didn't mean anything by it.

188
00:13:56.665 --> 00:13:58.165
- Now. young lady!

189
00:14:02.704 --> 00:14:05.114
(somber piano music)

190
00:14:05.114 --> 00:14:07.614
(door closes)

191
00:14:28.966 --> 00:14:30.446
Missy?

192
00:14:30.446 --> 00:14:33.096
Let's not talk about Uncle
Cody to your sister. okay?

193
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:35.543
- Okay.

194
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.023
Mom?

195
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.993
Is Ari going to leave us again?

196
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.390
- Looks like she's back to stay. honey.

197
00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:57.483
- Good.

198
00:15:05.261 --> 00:15:06.900
(knocks)

199
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.890
- [Mother] Ari?

200
00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:08.983
- Yeah. come in.

201
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.580
- Missy's so excited to
have you home. (chuckles)

202
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.413
We all are.

203
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.640
Even your father. he just...

204
00:15:25.182 --> 00:15:27.360
He just isn't so good at showing it.

205
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.573
- Same old dad.

206
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.013
- So...

207
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.490
I know you're dealing with a lot.

208
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.880
And if it ever gets too overwhelming or-

209
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.023
- You mean if I try to kill myself?

210
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.200
- I didn't say that.
- Don't worry. Mom.

211
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.033
I'm over that.

212
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.493
I can deal with this. okay?
- Okay.

213
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.983
- Hey. Mom?

214
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.283
When Timmy passed away. how old was he?

215
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.242
- I don't wanna talk about Timmy.

216
00:16:05.242 --> 00:16:08.325
(somber piano music)

217
00:16:11.853 --> 00:16:12.770
Six months.

218
00:16:14.277 --> 00:16:16.477
- And you said it was
because of crib death?

219
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.733
- That's what the doctor
said. and the coroner.

220
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:24.229
- But you didn't believe them.

221
00:16:24.229 --> 00:16:26.963
- You know what I believe.

222
00:16:26.963 --> 00:16:30.960
- Mom. these stories that you
told us when we were little?

223
00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:33.673
Do you think that they were true?

224
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:39.340
- Let's not talk about this.

225
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.200
The past is in the past.
That was so long ago.

226
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.413
Maybe you should talk to Dr. Woods.

227
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.190
She was really helpful
for me when I lost Timmy.

228
00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.763
- I don't need a psychiatrist.

229
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.400
- Okay.

230
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.740
(chuckles)

231
00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.510
- Oh. um...

232
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.750
Mom. do you think it would be okay

233
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.523
if I borrowed the car while I'm home?

234
00:17:10.523 --> 00:17:12.500
- Of course. hon.

235
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.333
- Thanks.

236
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:16.653
Mom?

237
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:20.683
Thanks.

238
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:27.520
(somber piano music)

239
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.020
(door closes)

240
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.200
(sighs)

241
00:17:39.472 --> 00:17:41.972
(birds tweet)

242
00:17:50.969 --> 00:17:52.630
(ominous tones)
(gasps)

243
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.890
Jesus. Paulie! You scared
the shit out of me.

244
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.110
- Sorry.

245
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.433
I heard about the accident.

246
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.313
I'm really sorry. Ari.

247
00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.580
- How have you been?

248
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.060
- It's all good.

249
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.670
- How's your dad?

250
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.763
- Still a pain in the ass. (chuckles)

251
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.503
Are you living at home now?

252
00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.250
- Yeah. I don't know for how long.

253
00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.140
- Well. it's really good to have you back.

254
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:21.973
- Thanks.

255
00:18:21.973 --> 00:18:25.530
- Hey. if you need to talk
or anything. just stop by.

256
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.140
We're right nextdoor. Just a short walk.

257
00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.373
- I will. Paulie.

258
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.083
Thanks.

259
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.043
- Dad would love to see
you. too. It's been a while.

260
00:18:41.739 --> 00:18:45.230
(somber piano music)

261
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.063
- Hey. Paulie?

262
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:47.843
- Yeah?

263
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.033
- Thanks.

264
00:18:51.569 --> 00:18:52.402
- Yeah.

265
00:18:58.654 --> 00:19:01.176
(suspenseful music)

266
00:19:01.176 --> 00:19:03.810
(gasps and moans)

267
00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:04.643
No.

268
00:19:07.393 --> 00:19:09.393
(pants)

269
00:19:19.294 --> 00:19:21.294
(gasps)

270
00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:28.595
(sighs)

271
00:19:28.595 --> 00:19:33.344
(gasps)
(ominous tones)

272
00:19:33.344 --> 00:19:36.150
(sighs) Christ. Dad.
How did you get in here?

273
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.160
- I tried knocking. Door was open.

274
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.500
Welcome home.

275
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.980
- Thanks.

276
00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.070
- Sorry about everything
you're going through.

277
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.290
If there's anything your
mother or I could do

278
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.079
to help. just ask.

279
00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:48.120
- I will.

280
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.630
- Things have been pretty
peaceful around here

281
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:50.981
since you left.

282
00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.630
- (scoffs) Well. don't worry. Dad.

283
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.830
As soon as I find Joshua
and I get back on my feet.

284
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.820
I'll be out of here.
- That's not what I meant.

285
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.513
- Well maybe it's not what you
meant but I get the message.

286
00:20:08.732 --> 00:20:13.732
(door closes)
(ominous tones)

287
00:20:14.952 --> 00:20:17.035
(knocks)

288
00:20:18.231 --> 00:20:22.814
(knocks)
(birds tweet)

289
00:20:25.285 --> 00:20:27.630
(door creaks)

290
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.463
Yes?

291
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.183
- Sorry to bother you

292
00:20:30.183 --> 00:20:32.343
so early in the morning. Mrs. Chandler.

293
00:20:33.821 --> 00:20:36.488
(chain rattles)

294
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.680
- Have you found Joshua?

295
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:44.733
- Joshua passed away in the
accident. Mrs. Chandler.

296
00:20:44.733 --> 00:20:46.007
- I don't believe that.

297
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:50.183
- I'm gonna need you to
come down to the station.

298
00:20:50.183 --> 00:20:52.290
There's a few questions I need to ask you.

299
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.205
- What kind of questions?

300
00:20:54.205 --> 00:20:56.430
- We can cover that at the station.

301
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.200
- Well. maybe you should
be trying to find Joshua.

302
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.953
rather than asking me questions.

303
00:21:00.882 --> 00:21:02.639
(Lenny sighs)

304
00:21:02.639 --> 00:21:04.693
- I must insist. Mrs. Chandler.

305
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:08.010
- All right.

306
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:08.960
Let me get dressed.

307
00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:14.279
(door closes)

308
00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:19.279
(lock clacks)
(eerie tones)

309
00:21:26.749 --> 00:21:27.760
- [Lenny] I need you to take me back

310
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.233
to the night of the accident.

311
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.560
- I already told you
everything I remember.

312
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.177
- Tell me again.

313
00:21:34.177 --> 00:21:36.000
(Ariana sighs)

314
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.423
- I was in my car. Joshua
was in the back seat.

315
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.530
- What was your state of mind?

316
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:43.830
- Do you mean was I drunk?

317
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:47.510
I've been sober for a long time.

318
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.760
- Losing your husband.

319
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.680
being left to raise your baby all alone.

320
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.970
That's a lot of pressure.

321
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.553
- I can handle being alone.

322
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.690
- Attempted suicide when you were 22.

323
00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.993
Drug and alcohol problems.
History of depression.

324
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.740
In fact. depression runs
in your family. Doesn't it?

325
00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.490
- That all changed when I met Cody.

326
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.880
- Yeah. Cody. Your husband.

327
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.950
He joined the army.
Deployed to the Middle East.

328
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.563
Comes back with PTSD and commits suicide.

329
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.550
That is a hell of a lot to
deal with for a single mom.

330
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.850
- What are you getting at?

331
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.650
- Okay. so. you're driving. Then what?

332
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.893
- Joshua started crying. so I
turned around to comfort him.

333
00:22:38.893 --> 00:22:41.230
- Oh. so you took your eyes off the road?

334
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.453
- For just a second.

335
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.730
And then when I turned back around.

336
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.893
there was a man in the road.

337
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.030
- (sighs) Then what?

338
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.720
- I swerved to avoid hitting him.

339
00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:55.950
- Did you hit him?

340
00:22:56.819 --> 00:22:58.486
- I don't know. I...

341
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.880
I don't remember anything after that.

342
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.473
- What do you think happened?

343
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.470
- I think it was the Hoodman.

344
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.683
I think it took my kid.

345
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.630
- "The Hoodman"?

346
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.910
The urban legend?

347
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:16.743
- [Ariana] Yes.

348
00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.340
- [Lenny] Mrs. Chandler. I
want you to look at these.

349
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.050
- [Ariana] What's this?

350
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:27.940
- Those are photographs of your son.

351
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.819
It's how we found him in the car seat.

352
00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:32.411
- No.

353
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:34.210
- (sighs) Look at them. Mrs. Chandler.

354
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.570
You can't argue with the facts.

355
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.753
- He was taken!

356
00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:41.919
(Lenny sighs)

357
00:23:43.179 --> 00:23:45.770
(Lenny sighs)

358
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.270
- You wanna know what I think?

359
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.540
I think you couldn't cope.

360
00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.953
with your husband committing suicide.

361
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.210
Left all alone to raise a
six-month-old all by yourself

362
00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:01.920
and uh. (chuckles) you
couldn't take the pressure.

363
00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.310
So you wanted to end it.
- I wouldn't do that.

364
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.420
- Why wouldn't you?

365
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.180
It wouldn't be your
first attempt at suicide.

366
00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.430
- I would never do
something like that again.

367
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.133
- I know what it's like to lose someone.

368
00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.703
Especially a kid.

369
00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.963
I lost my son.

370
00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:23.000
- I'm sorry.

371
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.430
I didn't know that.

372
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.450
- Finding out what happened to him...

373
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.163
It's the only thing that keeps me living.

374
00:24:31.298 --> 00:24:32.848
I don't buy this Hoodman angle.

375
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.503
I only believe in plausible explanations.

376
00:24:39.099 --> 00:24:40.970
- Am I under arrest?

377
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.610
- No. not yet.

378
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:43.858
- Okay.

379
00:24:43.858 --> 00:24:44.708
Then I'm leaving.

380
00:24:48.811 --> 00:24:51.531
(door creaks)

381
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:53.948
(door slams)

382
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.578
- I'll be in touch. (chuckles)

383
00:24:58.578 --> 00:25:03.578
(swing squeaks)
(background chatter)

384
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.370
- I like having you around now.

385
00:25:12.349 --> 00:25:14.149
Now I have someone to do stuff with.

386
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.510
- Well don't you have any friends?

387
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.540
- No.

388
00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.783
Nobody likes me.

389
00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.713
- Hey.

390
00:25:21.713 --> 00:25:23.150
- They don't wanna play with me.

391
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.620
- Why would you say that?

392
00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.610
- They think I'm weird.

393
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.763
- You're not weird.

394
00:25:30.931 --> 00:25:34.027
- Walk to your own beat. Missy.
That's what I always did.

395
00:25:34.027 --> 00:25:35.220
- And that's why you
were the weirdest girl

396
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.731
I knew in high school.

397
00:25:36.731 --> 00:25:39.593
- (chuckles) Seriously. do your own thing.

398
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.013
- Where's Gabe?

399
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.610
- He's with his dad this weekend.

400
00:25:47.297 --> 00:25:49.964
(swing squeaks)

401
00:25:55.851 --> 00:25:58.900
(ominous tones)

402
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.000
- [Ariana] Oh. my god.

403
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.289
- Keep pushing.
- What's wrong?

404
00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:04.456
- I thought I saw someone.

405
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.912
- I don't see anyone.

406
00:26:08.912 --> 00:26:09.943
- [Missy] Push!

407
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.930
- Hey. we should get going.

408
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:15.550
Okay?

409
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.430
- Why do we have to leave so soon?

410
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:18.883
- I'll call you later. okay?

411
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.650
Come on. hon.

412
00:26:37.078 --> 00:26:39.828
(car door slams)

413
00:26:44.329 --> 00:26:47.079
(car door slams)

414
00:26:57.631 --> 00:27:00.048
(car starts)

415
00:27:02.996 --> 00:27:06.079
(somber piano music)

416
00:27:34.233 --> 00:27:35.066
Missy...

417
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.560
If you ever see anything
strange or unusual.

418
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.663
I want you to tell me. okay?

419
00:27:43.964 --> 00:27:45.410
- Like what?

420
00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:46.243
- Anything.

421
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.333
Deal?

422
00:27:49.633 --> 00:27:50.466
- Deal.

423
00:28:04.551 --> 00:28:07.468
(garage door hums)

424
00:28:17.951 --> 00:28:20.451
(door closes)

425
00:28:30.505 --> 00:28:33.255
(water splashes)

426
00:29:02.597 --> 00:29:05.550
- [Woods] I'm happy you
chose to see me. Ariana.

427
00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.250
You've been through quite
a series of ordeals.

428
00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.950
- [Ariana] Enough to see a head doctor.

429
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.480
- There's nothing wrong
with psychotherapy.

430
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.800
I helped your mom once

431
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.100
when she was going through
a difficult trauma.

432
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.260
- The only difficult
trauma I'm going through

433
00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.707
is trying to find my son.

434
00:29:22.707 --> 00:29:25.673
- And what do you think
happened with Joshua?

435
00:29:25.673 --> 00:29:29.000
- I don't know. I just
know that he can't be dead.

436
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.293
- And why do you say that?
- Because I know.

437
00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.220
He was...

438
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.713
Taken.

439
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.123
- Who do you believe took him?

440
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.100
- The Hoodman.
(ominous tones)

441
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.740
- Your mother mentioned
this Hoodman character

442
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.270
when she was seeing me.

443
00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:52.070
She believed he was responsible
for the loss of her child.

444
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:55.233
- Yes. and she still
believes that to this day.

445
00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.480
You know. people. they say
that this is just a story.

446
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.773
but it's not. I know that it's true.

447
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.450
I saw him and he caused the accident.

448
00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:09.143
This man. he is stealing children.

449
00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:15.750
- Ari. urban legends are
just a form of folklore.

450
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.550
They're stories that are passed on orally

451
00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.400
and on the internet.

452
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.960
They're not real.

453
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.490
They're just tales.

454
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.240
- But what if they're based on truth?

455
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.600
- Well. I know you believe that.

456
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.883
- My mother has been
telling me these stories

457
00:30:32.883 --> 00:30:37.883
even since I was little.
but. but it wasn't just her.

458
00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.770
These stories have been
circulating around this town

459
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.230
for as long as I can remember.

460
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:47.690
- When people are under great stress.

461
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:52.690
such as with a trauma or
the loss of a loved one.

462
00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:58.850
some violent incident. their
minds can make them believe

463
00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.933
that things are happening
that aren't real.

464
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:07.133
- I'm not crazy. and
I'm not making this up.

465
00:31:09.799 --> 00:31:13.720
- Well. you've been
conditioned for a long time

466
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.020
to believe these things.

467
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.270
You've suffered a tremendous loss.

468
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:23.630
The loss of your husband and
then right on the heels of that

469
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:26.803
the accident in which you lost your son.

470
00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.050
You somehow feel responsible

471
00:31:31.138 --> 00:31:34.160
and it's these negative feelings

472
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.153
that are driving your thoughts.

473
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.330
- The man that I saw is real.

474
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.430
- Well. that's what we're here to work on.

475
00:31:47.915 --> 00:31:52.915
(Ariana breathes sharply)
(eerie music)

476
00:32:32.003 --> 00:32:34.586
(music swells)

477
00:32:37.792 --> 00:32:40.375
(Ariana gasps)

478
00:32:50.068 --> 00:32:52.651
(Ariana sighs)

479
00:32:58.056 --> 00:33:00.085
(somber music)

480
00:33:00.085 --> 00:33:01.976
- [Ariana] All right. big jump.

481
00:33:01.976 --> 00:33:03.165
- Okay.
(Ariana chuckles)

482
00:33:03.165 --> 00:33:04.498
One. two. three.

483
00:33:05.627 --> 00:33:09.216
(water splashes)
(Ariana chuckles)

484
00:33:09.216 --> 00:33:12.387
- That was great! (chuckles)

485
00:33:12.387 --> 00:33:14.200
This was a really good idea.

486
00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.860
She doesn't have a chance to get out much.

487
00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.750
- What are neighbors for?

488
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.270
Besides. you being home
is the most excitement

489
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.576
I've had in a long time.

490
00:33:23.576 --> 00:33:26.363
You know. I used to have a
crush on you in high school?

491
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:29.060
- I never knew that.

492
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.713
- I just was too afraid to
come up and say something.

493
00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:37.250
- (chuckles) No. it's weird.
we lived across from each other

494
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.070
for so long. but I never really saw you.

495
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.920
- Yeah. we just stayed in our own place.

496
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.440
and then. after Mom died...

497
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.800
- Yeah.

498
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.760
Hey. I never had a chance to tell you

499
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.103
how sorry I was about that.

500
00:33:52.103 --> 00:33:52.936
- It's okay.

501
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.683
- She was sick for a while. right?

502
00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.560
- Cancer.

503
00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.910
- Yeah. it's tough losing
people that you love.

504
00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:03.320
- Dad didn't take it too well.

505
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.793
I still don't think he's gotten over it.

506
00:34:07.157 --> 00:34:08.138
- [Missy] Cannonball!

507
00:34:08.138 --> 00:34:10.090
(water splashes)

508
00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.490
- That was the best one yet.

509
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.280
Oh. hi. Mr. Montgomery.

510
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.853
I haven't seen you in ages.

511
00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:26.853
- Well. Ariana. I'm sorry
to hear about your loss.

512
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:34.023
Enjoy your ice cream.

513
00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.073
- Is he okay?

514
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.290
- Yeah. he's just been
like that since Mom passed.

515
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.533
He's. he's all right.

516
00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:48.643
He's happy you're home.

517
00:34:48.643 --> 00:34:52.234
- [Ariana] Yeah. you could've fooled me.

518
00:34:52.234 --> 00:34:54.151
- [Paulie] We both are.

519
00:34:58.005 --> 00:34:59.445
(Ariana chuckles)

520
00:34:59.445 --> 00:35:01.730
- That was so much fun.
- Yeah?

521
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:03.370
You ready for some ice cream?
- Yeah!

522
00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.353
I can't wait to have some ice cream.

523
00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:06.731
- Mm-hm.

524
00:35:06.731 --> 00:35:08.804
Look at the flavor.
- (gasps) Vanilla!

525
00:35:08.804 --> 00:35:10.793
- Mm-hm!
- My favorite flavor.

526
00:35:10.793 --> 00:35:13.626
(Ariana chuckles)

527
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:21.665
- Someone had their fill of
swimming today. and ice cream.

528
00:35:21.665 --> 00:35:24.265
(chuckles)

529
00:35:24.265 --> 00:35:26.793
- I really love when we do stuff together.

530
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:29.310
- Me too.

531
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.143
I miss that.

532
00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.270
So you had fun today?

533
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.500
- I had lots of fun.
- Good.

534
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.663
- And I saw you with Paulie.

535
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:43.810
- Yeah?
- Yes.

536
00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:45.380
- Well. so what?

537
00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.817
- Do you like him?

538
00:35:47.937 --> 00:35:51.023
- (chuckles) No. no.
Paulie is just a friend.

539
00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.157
- A friend?
- Mm-hm!

540
00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:57.926
- Oh. really?
- Yes. I promise!

541
00:35:57.926 --> 00:35:59.890
(chuckles)

542
00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:04.276
What if I were to pinky
promise he's just a friend?

543
00:36:04.276 --> 00:36:05.326
Would you believe me?

544
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:07.893
- Fine.

545
00:36:08.937 --> 00:36:10.330
I do believe you.

546
00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:11.980
- Okay.

547
00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.480
That's enough for now. You
gotta get to bed. okay?

548
00:36:15.944 --> 00:36:18.084
- Okay.
- Goodnight.

549
00:36:18.084 --> 00:36:19.251
- Night night.

550
00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:29.868
(switch clicks)

551
00:36:39.924 --> 00:36:42.674
(lighter flicks)

552
00:36:44.324 --> 00:36:46.907
(Tawnie sighs)

553
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.463
- Look. Joshua's gone. Ari.

554
00:36:52.604 --> 00:36:54.733
The sooner you can
accept that. the better.

555
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.610
- If it were Gabriel.
you would feel different.

556
00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:02.460
- Look. sometimes when
there's an accident.

557
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.680
and the death is very sudden.

558
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:07.660
the spirit can remain
in the material world.

559
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.890
- What are you saying?

560
00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.290
That the ghost of my son is haunting me?

561
00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:12.840
- I'm saying there's an energy.

562
00:37:14.396 --> 00:37:15.733
A spirit energy.

563
00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.203
You owe it to yourself
to at least look into it.

564
00:37:24.114 --> 00:37:25.823
You still having nightmares?

565
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.753
- Yeah.

566
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.240
- Man. there's been weird things going on

567
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.010
in this town as long as I can remember.

568
00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:36.983
Kids dying.

569
00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.063
Kids disappearing.

570
00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:42.006
The whole thing gives me the creeps.

571
00:37:42.006 --> 00:37:44.756
(lighter flicks)

572
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.020
If it were me. I tell you what I'd do.

573
00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:50.163
Research.

574
00:37:53.406 --> 00:37:56.406
(suspenseful music)

575
00:37:58.577 --> 00:38:01.327
(lighter flicks)

576
00:38:13.566 --> 00:38:16.649
(footsteps approach)

577
00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:21.533
- There's a lot more here than I thought.

578
00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.030
A local author named Frank Hackman

579
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.123
submitted this personal
journal to the library.

580
00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:34.290
He claims that his own child was abducted

581
00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:36.680
by some form of sandman.

582
00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:37.635
- Hoodman?

583
00:38:37.635 --> 00:38:39.660
- The Hoodman. That's it.

584
00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.563
He claims that this Hoodman is real.

585
00:38:43.795 --> 00:38:45.270
I'm gonna be around for
a couple more hours.

586
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.750
If there's anything you need.

587
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:49.985
There's more information here
and the books are full of it.

588
00:38:49.985 --> 00:38:52.652
- Okay. thank you for your help.

589
00:38:58.643 --> 00:39:01.976
(dark orchestral music)

590
00:39:48.697 --> 00:39:51.530
(keyboard clacks)

591
00:39:59.946 --> 00:40:02.779
(keyboard clacks)

592
00:40:11.346 --> 00:40:14.179
(keyboard clacks)

593
00:40:42.347 --> 00:40:44.430
(knocks)

594
00:40:45.828 --> 00:40:47.911
(knocks)

595
00:40:51.725 --> 00:40:53.808
(knocks)

596
00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.080
- Who is it?

597
00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:56.943
- Mr. Hackman?

598
00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.370
My name is Ariana Chandler.

599
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:03.050
I need to talk to you.
It's about your daughter.

600
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:04.513
- [Frank] Go away!

601
00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.975
- Mr. Hackman. I need to
know about the Hoodman.

602
00:41:08.975 --> 00:41:11.642
(ominous tones)

603
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.470
- [Frank] Are you a reporter?

604
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:25.543
- I'm not a reporter. Mr.
Hackman. I lost my son.

605
00:41:25.543 --> 00:41:28.876
(dark orchestral music)

606
00:41:33.778 --> 00:41:36.278
(door closes)

607
00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:42.630
- [Frank] What do you want?

608
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.670
- I've seen him.

609
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:45.600
The Hoodman?

610
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.530
- [Frank] Where did you see him?

611
00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.713
- I was driving my car and he
stepped out in front of it.

612
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.563
I crashed and I lost my baby.

613
00:41:59.466 --> 00:42:00.400
- What did he look like?

614
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.463
- He had a dark cloak and a hood.

615
00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.540
- And have you seen him since?

616
00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.393
- Yes. I believe that he's following me.

617
00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.483
- In your dreams?

618
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:16.903
- Yes.

619
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:20.633
- She was seven.

620
00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:23.150
When he took her.

621
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.383
The bedroom window was open and
I. I. I never saw her again.

622
00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:32.043
- I'm sorry.

623
00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.180
- I've spent my life
trying to convince people

624
00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.858
that he's real.

625
00:42:38.858 --> 00:42:41.343
To those who believe in him.

626
00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.310
My daughter...

627
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:46.873
Believed in him.

628
00:42:49.688 --> 00:42:50.838
And if you've seen him.

629
00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:53.443
if you believe in him.

630
00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.563
you're in danger.

631
00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.963
- So what do I do to stop him?

632
00:43:01.757 --> 00:43:03.800
(Frank chuckles)

633
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.373
- Stop believing in him.

634
00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.090
- I'm sorry. this was a mistake.

635
00:43:16.268 --> 00:43:18.685
(door slams)

636
00:43:19.869 --> 00:43:24.869
(Frank sighs)
(door slams)

637
00:43:24.988 --> 00:43:26.905
(thud)

638
00:43:40.429 --> 00:43:42.512
(knocks)

639
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:46.353
- Miss Chandler?

640
00:43:52.736 --> 00:43:55.069
(gun cocks)

641
00:43:57.947 --> 00:43:59.120
(door thuds)

642
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.766
Hello. Frank.
(suspenseful music)

643
00:44:02.766 --> 00:44:04.620
(sniffs)

644
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:07.170
Oh. god. This place is a dump.

645
00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:08.470
How do you live like this?

646
00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.533
- I get by.

647
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.750
- I never liked you. Frank.

648
00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.363
You were a weirdo in high school.

649
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.773
and you're still a weirdo.

650
00:44:29.516 --> 00:44:30.680
- Ow!

651
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.010
God!

652
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:32.843
Damn it!

653
00:44:32.843 --> 00:44:34.620
- You shouldn't play with guns. Frank.

654
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.970
One's liable to go off.
Someone might get hurt.

655
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:41.170
You know. I don't believe in all this

656
00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.913
boogie man crap that you're into.

657
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.590
I don't believe in fairytales and

658
00:44:47.328 --> 00:44:49.228
I don't believe in all this myth shit.

659
00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.010
But what I do believe is
that someone's out there

660
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:58.040
playing dress-up and victimizing people.

661
00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.583
You wouldn't know anything
about that. would you. Frank?

662
00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.930
- You think I'd kill my own daughter?

663
00:45:06.968 --> 00:45:09.573
Hoodman is not a myth!

664
00:45:10.608 --> 00:45:11.899
(Lenny chuckles)

665
00:45:11.899 --> 00:45:12.899
- "Hoodman."

666
00:45:17.838 --> 00:45:18.880
You know. for a grown man.

667
00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.403
you sure got a lot of
kid stuff around here.

668
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.410
This belong to one of the victims?

669
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:26.603
- It belonged to my daughter.

670
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:32.600
- I need you to come down to
the station tomorrow. Frank.

671
00:45:33.859 --> 00:45:35.909
There's some questions I need to ask you.

672
00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:43.263
Seven AM. tomorrow morning.

673
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:47.610
Don't be late.

674
00:45:51.095 --> 00:45:53.512
(door thuds)

675
00:45:57.585 --> 00:46:02.585
(door closes)
(lock clicks)

676
00:46:17.203 --> 00:46:18.473
(muffled clunk)
(Ariana gasps)

677
00:46:18.473 --> 00:46:20.682
(suspenseful music)

678
00:46:20.682 --> 00:46:23.349
(child giggles)

679
00:46:45.122 --> 00:46:47.705
(muffled thud)

680
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:55.470
(door creaks)

681
00:47:00.289 --> 00:47:01.122
- Hello?

682
00:47:08.061 --> 00:47:10.561
(door closes)

683
00:47:15.551 --> 00:47:18.051
(eerie music)

684
00:47:20.458 --> 00:47:22.958
(door creaks)

685
00:47:34.688 --> 00:47:37.271
(somber music)

686
00:47:53.288 --> 00:47:55.788
(Lenny sighs)

687
00:48:33.508 --> 00:48:36.008
(Lenny sighs)

688
00:48:48.397 --> 00:48:51.488
(door squeaks)

689
00:48:51.488 --> 00:48:53.495
(door closes)

690
00:48:53.495 --> 00:48:55.995
(Lenny sighs)

691
00:48:57.275 --> 00:48:59.858
(folder slams)

692
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.960
- Every time a child goes
missing in this town.

693
00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.393
you're somewhere nearby.

694
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:09.273
That a coincidence. Frank?

695
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:16.203
And you think this Hoodman.
he's responsible. huh?

696
00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:21.203
From where I stand. imaginary
evil spirits don't kill kids.

697
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:23.680
- That's because you're not a believer.

698
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.133
- You believe that this Hoodman. he uh.

699
00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.810
he took your daughter too. huh?

700
00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:32.690
- I know he did.

701
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.020
- So what does he do
with these kids. Frank?

702
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.220
- He puts them to sleep.

703
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.990
assimilates their spirit
and they pass away.

704
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.543
- That's kind of a
stretch. don't you think?

705
00:49:43.543 --> 00:49:45.443
- I wouldn't expect you to understand.

706
00:49:46.315 --> 00:49:48.815
(Lenny sighs)

707
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:52.290
- Where were you the night

708
00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:54.750
your daughter went missing. Frank?

709
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.680
- I was at work.

710
00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.580
My boss vouched for me. It's
in the first investigation.

711
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:03.600
- Yeah. I can see that.
Lucky for you he did. huh?

712
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:05.510
- I didn't kill her!

713
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.867
She was taken!

714
00:50:07.867 --> 00:50:09.427
(tense music)

715
00:50:09.427 --> 00:50:12.660
- It says here the
babysitter was found dead.

716
00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:17.810
No sign of forced entry into the house.

717
00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:20.653
and you found your
daughter gone from her bed.

718
00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:24.467
And she's not been heard from since.

719
00:50:24.467 --> 00:50:25.803
That was 14 years ago.

720
00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.663
No body was ever found.

721
00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:32.890
- That's right.

722
00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:36.770
- And since then. four
other kids have gone missing

723
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.313
under similar circumstances.

724
00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:40.460
- There's more than that.

725
00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:42.927
If you go back far enough.

726
00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:47.163
There's even more still if
you go outside the county.

727
00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:51.970
There are hundreds of children
who have gone missing.

728
00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:53.723
and nobody has ever found them!

729
00:50:55.346 --> 00:50:57.080
What do you say about that. Lenny. huh?

730
00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.330
You think I did that too?

731
00:51:03.986 --> 00:51:04.819
(Lenny sighs)

732
00:51:04.819 --> 00:51:07.250
- Were you anywhere near Hobbs Ferry road

733
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:10.043
the night that Ariana
Chandler's baby was killed?

734
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.983
- No.

735
00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:16.363
Look. do I need a lawyer here?

736
00:51:18.617 --> 00:51:21.086
- You can't afford a lawyer. Frank.

737
00:51:21.086 --> 00:51:24.730
You don't have a pot to piss
in or a window to throw it out.

738
00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:25.573
- Then can I go?

739
00:51:30.297 --> 00:51:32.737
(Lenny sighs)

740
00:51:32.737 --> 00:51:33.570
- Yeah.

741
00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:39.839
(door squeaks)

742
00:51:39.839 --> 00:51:41.839
(sighs)

743
00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.600
(sighs)

744
00:51:52.598 --> 00:51:54.417
(Ariana chuckles)

745
00:51:54.417 --> 00:51:58.490
- Can you read me a
story. like you used to?

746
00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:01.558
- You're getting a little old
for stories. don't you think?

747
00:52:01.558 --> 00:52:02.790
(chuckles)

748
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:05.050
Besides. it's way past your bedtime.

749
00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:06.850
You should've been asleep hours ago.

750
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:13.990
- Do you miss Cody?
(somber piano music)

751
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:15.143
- Yes. sweetie.

752
00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:17.533
I miss Cody very much.

753
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:22.133
- Mommy said not to ask you about him.

754
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:25.513
She said it would make you really upset.

755
00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:27.563
- No. it's okay.

756
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:32.673
- Why did Cody kill himself?

757
00:52:33.930 --> 00:52:34.843
Wasn't he happy?

758
00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:41.908
- Sweetie. sometimes
when people go to war.

759
00:52:41.908 --> 00:52:43.893
they do terrible things.

760
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.503
and Cody saw too many of them.

761
00:52:49.506 --> 00:52:50.606
He just couldn't cope.

762
00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.560
- So he killed himself because
he didn't wanna think about

763
00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.133
all those bad things anymore?

764
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:05.010
- That's enough for tonight.
sweetie. It's time for bed.

765
00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.713
Goodnight.

766
00:53:10.108 --> 00:53:12.775
(switch clicks)

767
00:53:15.187 --> 00:53:16.020
- Ari?

768
00:53:17.497 --> 00:53:20.438
At night. I have bad dreams.

769
00:53:20.438 --> 00:53:23.900
(dark orchestral music)

770
00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.283
- What kind of bad dreams?

771
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.013
- I don't really wanna
talk about them right now.

772
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.880
- Just close your eyes and count to 100.

773
00:53:38.756 --> 00:53:40.856
Before you know it. you'll be fast asleep.

774
00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:50.922
- One.

775
00:53:52.797 --> 00:53:53.630
Two.

776
00:53:55.598 --> 00:53:56.431
Three.

777
00:53:59.237 --> 00:54:00.070
Four.

778
00:54:03.009 --> 00:54:03.842
Five.

779
00:54:05.228 --> 00:54:07.728
(door closes)

780
00:54:10.965 --> 00:54:12.916
(baby cries)

781
00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:15.583
(ominous music)

782
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.717
(baby cries)

783
00:54:55.538 --> 00:54:57.845
(ominous tones)

784
00:54:57.845 --> 00:55:01.366
- Shit. (pants)

785
00:55:01.366 --> 00:55:02.825
(phone rings)

786
00:55:02.825 --> 00:55:04.307
Come on. Pick up. pick up. pick up!

787
00:55:04.307 --> 00:55:05.690
- [Paulie] Hey-oh. it's Paulie.

788
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:08.486
Leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.

789
00:55:08.486 --> 00:55:10.940
- Paulie. Paulie. there is
someone outside of your house.

790
00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.160
They're near your pool. Please.

791
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:14.060
Please meet me out there. Paulie.

792
00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:18.012
(ominous tones)

793
00:55:28.246 --> 00:55:30.996
(crickets chirp)

794
00:55:50.915 --> 00:55:53.915
(suspenseful music)

795
00:56:04.517 --> 00:56:05.350
Paulie?

796
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:09.623
Paulie. are you home?

797
00:56:10.717 --> 00:56:12.638
(gasps)
- Whoa. it's just me.

798
00:56:12.638 --> 00:56:14.150
It's just me.
- Oh. geez.

799
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:15.820
You scared the shit out of me. Paulie!

800
00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.510
- Sorry. I really gotta stop doing that.

801
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:20.080
I just had a look around.

802
00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.220
There's no boogie man. I checked.

803
00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:24.900
- Paulie. there was someone
standing by your pool.

804
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:26.750
- Maybe it was just Dad sleepwalking.

805
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.060
He does that sometimes.

806
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.160
- No. no. it wasn't your dad sleepwalking.

807
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.843
- Ari. listen to me.

808
00:56:31.843 --> 00:56:34.223
There's no one else
here besides Dad and I.

809
00:56:36.139 --> 00:56:38.463
I want you to go home
and just get some rest.

810
00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.870
- Okay.

811
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:43.411
- I'll come by and check
on you in the morning.

812
00:56:43.411 --> 00:56:45.550
I'm gonna go to bed.

813
00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:46.383
- Okay.

814
00:57:01.896 --> 00:57:05.063

Oh. my god.

817
00:57:22.021 --> 00:57:22.854
Missy.

818
00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:24.883
Missy. run!

819
00:57:24.883 --> 00:57:28.153
He's behind you. run! Missy!
(tense music)

820
00:57:30.169 --> 00:57:31.571
Hello?

821
00:57:31.571 --> 00:57:32.560
