Oh. uh.

530
00:25:55.583 --> 00:25:57.583
What’re you doing in this alley? Are you a thief?

531
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.708
Here. Go on.
LITTLE HARRY: Please. no ...

532
00:26:01.708 --> 00:26:03.708
Take it. I don’t want it.
LITTLE HARRY: Please. no.

533
00:26:05.875 --> 00:26:07.875
Then what do you want then?

534
00:26:08.292 --> 00:26:10.292
I’m on a break.

535
00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:12.625
I’m the cook at my dad’s restaurant

536
00:26:14.708 --> 00:26:16.708
Oh. you're a chef?
LITTLE HARRY: Cook.

537
00:26:17.375 --> 00:26:19.250
You are?

538
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.250
I’m such a foodie.

539
00:26:22.583 --> 00:26:25.333
What kind of chef/cook are you?

540
00:26:25.958 --> 00:26:27.958
I used to make Italian food.

541
00:26:28.875 --> 00:26:30.875
but that's all about to change... a new concept.

542
00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:32.917
Every night a different menu.

543
00:26:32.917 --> 00:26:35.333
Mondays - Indian. Tuesdays - Japanese.

544
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:37.333
Wednesday – God knows. Thursday – who cares.

545
00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:39.333
That sounds weird.

546
00:26:39.583 --> 00:26:41.583
Desperate measures for desperate times.

547
00:26:41.875 --> 00:26:43.875
Business sucks lately.

548
00:26:43.917 --> 00:26:45.750
Sucks. like it might close?

549
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:47.750
It’s not good.

550
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.042
That’s too bad. I was all set to give it a try.

551
00:26:55.208 --> 00:26:57.208
I just got dumped.

552
00:26:58.042 --> 00:26:59.542
I'm sorry.

553
00:26:59.542 --> 00:27:02.042
Correction. I dumped Brandon because he…

554
00:27:02.042 --> 00:27:03.708
Cheated.

555
00:27:03.708 --> 00:27:06.208
Who told you?
LITTLE HARRY: You did. "Asshole cheating --"

556
00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:08.208
Oh... (laughs)

557
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.500
Can I get you something?

558
00:27:13.083 --> 00:27:15.083
Ativan. valium. xanax...

559
00:27:15.375 --> 00:27:17.375
I’m not fussy.
LITTLE HARRY: (laughs)

560
00:27:17.375 --> 00:27:19.375
Sorry.

561
00:27:20.667 --> 00:27:22.667
What's your name?

562
00:27:22.667 --> 00:27:24.667
Sherri Williams. What's yours?

563
00:27:25.833 --> 00:27:27.833
Harry Cudicini.

564
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.750
Why don’t you come by after i finish up.

565
00:27:34.917 --> 00:27:36.917
I feel like testing some new recipes tonight

566
00:27:37.583 --> 00:27:39.583
and you said you’re a foodie.

567
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Maybe you can tell me what you think.

568
00:27:42.708 --> 00:27:44.708
Cool... Okay.

569
00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:47.583
Yeah. I guess. Sure.

570
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.333
Why not?

571
00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:51.333
I’ve got nothing better to do now that I’m not getting married.

572
00:27:54.083 --> 00:27:56.083
Hey I'll buy the wine.

573
00:27:56.417 --> 00:27:58.417
That’ll give me something to do. (laughs)
LITTLE HARRY: That's okay.

574
00:27:58.417 --> 00:28:00.417
I got it covered.
SHERRI: Oh.

575
00:28:00.417 --> 00:28:02.417
Okay.

Right after I got my MBA.

603
00:30:05.708 --> 00:30:07.708
out of the blue my dad

604
00:30:07.708 --> 00:30:09.708
decided he wants to go move to Virgin Gorda

605
00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:12.208

Yea it was.

609
00:30:20.833 --> 00:30:22.833
Especially for my mother.

610
00:30:22.833 --> 00:30:24.833
Not just his leaving. but he decided to take

611
00:30:24.833 --> 00:30:26.792
whatever money they had in the bank

612
00:30:26.792 --> 00:30:28.792
with him and leaving her to manage

613
00:30:28.792 --> 00:30:30.792
their real estate holdings on her own.

614
00:30:30.792 --> 00:30:32.375
Did she even know how?

615
00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:34.375
Not at first.

616
00:30:34.375 --> 00:30:36.375
She was in way over her heard.

617
00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:38.375
So she begged for me to come home and help her out.

618
00:30:39.417 --> 00:30:41.417
So. here I am six years later.

619
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000

620
00:30:44.583 --> 00:30:46.583
Sherri. I applied for a

622
00:30:49.042 --> 00:30:51.042
I should be hearing from her any day now.

I was just a baby when she left.

You mean she just took off?

658
00:33:04.792 --> 00:33:06.792
Well. she was just a kid herself.

She wasn’t ready for all that responsibility.

“It’s the wine.” Listen to you.

716
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:10.208

That sounds scary.

728
00:37:05.375 --> 00:37:07.375
Your fiancé was an idiot.

729
00:37:09.167 --> 00:37:11.167

00:37:50.542 --> 00:37:52.542
Oh.
SHERRI: No. no. no.

747
00:37:53.458 --> 00:37:55.292
Sweet is good.

We met him in the alley.

855
00:45:42.458 --> 00:45:44.458
He was on a break and
I was leaving Zoya’s.

Kaboom?

862
00:46:02.917 --> 00:46:04.583
It’s not like we’re getting married tomorrow.

863
00:46:04.583 --> 00:46:06.542
Maybe in a year or so?
LITTLE HARRY: Or two or three?

864

You just need time to digest the news.

867
00:46:14.583 --> 00:46:16.583
I hope it’s okay.

868
00:46:16.583 --> 00:46:18.583
I called my Mom left a message for her to meet me here.

869
00:46:18.625 --> 00:46:21.292
Here? Your mother's coming here?

870
00:46:21.458 --> 00:46:23.458
Yeah. I wanted her to meet you.

871
00:46:25.292 --> 00:46:27.292

Occupational hazard.

881
00:47:02.292 --> 00:47:04.292
It’s going to blister.

882
00:47:04.292 --> 00:47:05.958
Where's your First Aid kit?

883
00:47:05.958 --> 00:47:08.583
This is silly. It’s nothing.
SHERRI: You want it to get an infection?

884
00:47:09.667 --> 00:47:11.875
Okay. But don't make a big bandage.

885
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.750
Here. (sets down the first aid kit)

886
00:47:18.958 --> 00:47:20.958
Now ...

889
00:47:26.958 --> 00:47:28.958
I took a First Aid class in high school.

890

891

892
00:47:35.792 --> 00:47:37.792
Can you teach me how to speak Italian?

893
00:47:38.125 --> 00:47:40.125
I love the way it sounds.

894
00:47:40.125 --> 00:47:42.125
Then maybe you can teach my son...

895
00:47:42.125 --> 00:47:43.708

896

903
00:48:09.625 --> 00:48:11.625
Crunchy but not too hard.

904
00:48:13.417 --> 00:48:15.417

908

BIG HARRY: Oh ...

912
00:48:31.708 --> 00:48:33.667
It’s a secret recipe passed on
from my great grandmother

913
00:48:33.667 --> 00:48:35.667
to my grandmother to my mother.

914
00:48:35.833 --> 00:48:37.667
My nonna. She was really tiny

915
00:48:37.667 --> 00:48:39.667

BIG HARRY: You won't believe what they're offering

1278

$30.000 for three days.

1279

That’s great. Dad. But listen –
BIG HARRY: $30.000

1280
01:07:20.125 --> 01:07:21.958
I can pay off my back rent.

1281
01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:23.958
I’ll even have enough left over to market

1286
01:07:32.792 --> 01:07:35.083
Vegan?
BIG HARRY: Vaygan.

1287
01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:36.833
You mean vegan. And gluten free and -

1288
01:07:36.833 --> 01:07:39.000
Yeah. You know what I mean. It’s what everyone wants nowadays.

1289
01:07:39.375 --> 01:07:41.375
and it’ll be cheaper to run without meat.

1290
01:07:41.417 --> 01:07:43.417
Slap me five. kid. Slap me five.

1291
01:07:43.417 --> 01:07:45.417
(hands slap) I have a meeting with the tofu wholesaler

1293
01:07:47.583 --> 01:07:49.583

Why? What happened?

1299
01:08:01.167 --> 01:08:03.167
It was all happening too fast --

1300
01:08:03.792 --> 01:08:05.792
Aw. Jeez.

1303
01:08:10.667 --> 01:08:12.667
it was pretty insane.

1304
01:08:13.333 --> 01:08:15.333
Sherri’s a doll. but getting

1305
01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:17.333
engaged on the first date was the kind of impulsive

1306
01:08:17.333 --> 01:08:19.333
thing I’d be more likely to do than you. eh.

1307
01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:21.917
Like father. like son?

1308
01:08:22.833 --> 01:08:24.458
But the idea’s still good.

1309
01:08:24.458 --> 01:08:26.458
You can be in charge of Noninna’s Biscotti.

1310
01:08:26.708 --> 01:08:28.708
Do it any way you want. I’ll stay out of it.

1311

1312
01:08:31.708 --> 01:08:33.708

1313
01:08:33.958 --> 01:08:35.958

1314
01:08:36.083 --> 01:08:38.750
Me. Lidia chose me.

1315
01:08:40.542 --> 01:08:42.542
Ah. no.

1316

1317
01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:56.667
maybe it’s time you find out what the real world is like ...

1318
01:08:57.417 --> 01:08:59.417
Get kicked around a little like everybody else ...

1319
01:08:59.833 --> 01:09:01.833
It’s been too easy.

1320
01:09:02.542 --> 01:09:04.542
Yeah.

1321
01:09:04.667 --> 01:09:06.667
it’ll be a good lesson.

1322
01:09:07.125 --> 01:09:09.000
And maybe you’ll appreciate your ole man more.

1323
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.458
Dad. I do appreciate you. I’m going to make you proud.

1324
