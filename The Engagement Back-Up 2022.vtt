Lighthouses. shipwrecks.
whaling boats.

27
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.171
I'm doing one of the exercises
in my Live Your Dream Life book

What if we opened this place
up to events?

30
00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.873
Well. that's why I've spent
the last two years

31
00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:16.614
courting Imogene Heron.

32
00:02:16.788 --> 00:02:18.573
I really think if she gave
a history talk here

33
00:02:18.747 --> 00:02:19.791
it would draw a crowd.

34
00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.228
That's not that kind of event.

35
00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:24.056

a blurb.

we'll be in the black.

40
00:02:40.464 --> 00:02:42.597
What would I know
about weddings?

41
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:46.470
My father ran a history museum.
not a wedding factory.

42
00:02:46.644 --> 00:02:49.125
What if people spill champagne
on the books

43
00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.955
or walk past the exhibits
without even reading them?

44
00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.566
Just weekends. and spring
and summer.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.221
If I were getting married.

46
00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:00.397
maybe I'd think about
doing it here.

47
00:03:00.571 --> 00:03:03.095
But what's the appeal if
you're not a history buff?

48
00:03:04.053 --> 00:03:05.272
Wait.

49
00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:09.885
So. you do think about
getting married?

50
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:13.323
Like. in the distant.
distant future.

00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:37.299
A lot of folks are misinformed.

180

Oh. I am the Queen
of information.

181
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.959
So. thank you for your concern.
but I've got this. all of this.

182

Good luck with your
garbage cans.

183

Ok.

He's always in the papers
and on social media.

194
00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:19.602
It's actually the opposite
of famous.

195

No one really knows you.
but they think they do.

196
00:09:21.996 --> 00:09:24.215
Well. it seems like he does
a lot of good.

Just a little bit differently.

204

And. he's a bachelor.

205
00:09:40.492 --> 00:09:42.277
Surprise. surprise.

206
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:45.019
Not the playboy kind.
A total class act.

207

Into women for their minds.

Ok. enough with the celebrity

When did you take that?

Why did you take that?

216

He was in that nice suit
and you were in the dress

217
00:10:13.787 --> 00:10:15.571

It says so in the book.

221
00:10:26.321 --> 00:10:27.801
So...

Yeah.

229
00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:43.773
But we're still manifesting.

00:10:49.387 --> 00:10:50.432
Done!

Oh.

00:10:54.088 --> 00:10:55.045
Uh-oh.

You mean your vision board?

I'm so sorry.

239
00:11:06.317 --> 00:11:07.405
Erica Rosario said to save it
in a place you always see it.

240
00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:08.493
Every day.

241
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.017
So. it was on my desktop.

242

Who did we send this to?

243
00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:13.542
Just our publicity list.

So. journals. bloggers.

Please tell me not Nolan Elias?

247
00:11:27.164 --> 00:11:27.948
Nolan Elias.

248
00:11:28.122 --> 00:11:29.471
No!

249
00:11:29.645 --> 00:11:30.907
He's the best journalist
in the country.

250
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:32.430
Now he'll never
take me seriously.

251
00:11:32.604 --> 00:11:34.171
How do we retract it?

252
00:11:34.345 --> 00:11:37.000
I can recall the email
if they haven't opened it.

253
00:11:37.174 --> 00:11:41.570

His engagement.

259
00:11:54.365 --> 00:11:55.453

coming back like a mosquito.

sister from this private jet

274
00:12:29.096 --> 00:12:31.011

about the direction
we're moving.

299
00:14:14.549 --> 00:14:16.420
So. we just need you to make
an official statement

300
00:14:16.594 --> 00:14:18.422
of retraction.

301
00:14:18.596 --> 00:14:20.903
Of retraction?
No. no. no. no.

302
00:14:21.077 --> 00:14:22.339
We don't retract now.

We don't?

304

Think of this as
a slow roll out.

You know. we let the story
build momentum

we want people to know
who you are.

308
00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:35.352
because what you do.
it's amazing.

309
00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:38.094
It is a very special business.

310
00:14:38.268 --> 00:14:40.923
But shouldn't we do something
about the engagement?

311
00:14:41.097 --> 00:14:42.882
Engagement?

312
00:14:43.056 --> 00:14:45.667
Is that a sort of new trendy
term for funding a start-up?

313
00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:48.061
Yeah. I guess theoretically
we are.

314
00:14:48.235 --> 00:14:50.193
yeah. sure. we're engaging
in your. in your bus...

315
00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:52.848
What a minute. are you
Miss Maritime?

316
00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:53.849
Yes!

317
00:14:55.155 --> 00:14:58.985
I mean. no.
But. yes.

318
00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:00.551
I thought you looked familiar.

319
00:15:00.725 --> 00:15:02.292
I just couldn't place
you from where.

320
00:15:02.466 --> 00:15:03.293
You're missing the gown
and where's Mr. Maritime?

321
00:15:03.467 --> 00:15:05.165
There is no Mr. Maritime.

322
00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:09.821
Well. I mean. you're
Mr. Maritime.

323
00:15:09.996 --> 00:15:11.388
Right.

324
00:15:11.562 --> 00:15:12.912
We were manifesting
with a photoshoot.

325

We want to start
hosting weddings.

Live your dream life.
It really works.

327
00:15:17.046 --> 00:15:18.352
She attached the wrong file.

328
00:15:18.526 --> 00:15:19.570
So we were hoping
you'd write a statement.

329
00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:21.355
Just to clear the air.

330
00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:22.834
I was wondering why
you were plastering

331
00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:24.271
this picture of us everywhere.

332
00:15:24.445 --> 00:15:26.229
Oh. it wasn't me.

333
00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:28.318
That's why we wanted you
to step in.

334
00:15:28.492 --> 00:15:31.017
You have a lot of followers.

335
00:15:31.191 --> 00:15:34.629
And we wanted publicity but not
this kind of publicity.

336
00:15:34.803 --> 00:15:37.023
No. you're right.
You're right.

337
00:15:37.197 --> 00:15:38.981
I mean. I mean with my current
business affairs.

338
00:15:39.155 --> 00:15:40.417
it's best just to kill a
frivolous story like this

339
00:15:40.591 --> 00:15:42.289
before it gets out of hand.

340
00:15:42.463 --> 00:15:44.421
so I will let my publicist know
and it will be gone.

341
00:15:44.595 --> 00:15:48.599
I mean. I wouldn't call
it completely frivolous.

342
00:15:48.773 --> 00:15:50.558
Ok. sorry. not.
not frivolous. just.

343
00:15:50.732 --> 00:15:53.909
it's a little out there.

344
00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:57.043

Yeah.

348

the statement.

357
00:16:41.652 --> 00:16:44.568
It's Nolan Elias from
the Island Post Magazine.

358
00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:47.093
I can't believe you're getting
married to Jackson Valentine.

359
00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:48.833
Congratulations.

360
00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.400
Anyway. I thought there
might be a story there

361
00:16:50.574 --> 00:16:52.620
with you doing it
at the museum.

362
00:16:52.794 --> 00:16:57.407
Call me. or shoot me an email
at NolanElias@swifty-mail.com.

363
00:16:57.581 --> 00:16:59.105
Take care!

364
00:16:59.975 --> 00:17:00.932
Oh.

365
00:17:01.107 --> 00:17:02.934
Such a shame.

366
00:17:03.109 --> 00:17:04.588
Too bad for the best journalist.

367
00:17:04.762 --> 00:17:07.852
my imaginary wedding
isn't actually happening.

368
00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:12.118
Or. imagine the real publicity.

369
00:17:16.165 --> 00:17:17.775
Our own father is refusing
to endorse me.

370
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:18.994
You had to know that?

371
00:17:19.168 --> 00:17:20.952
Of course I knew that.

372
00:17:21.127 --> 00:17:22.954
but I didn't know that you were
counting on Dad's vote.

373
00:17:23.129 --> 00:17:25.435
Why would our father vote
for you when you've shown

374
00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:28.003
absolutely no interest in
the future of this company?

375
00:17:28.177 --> 00:17:30.527
The ideas I'm proposing would
bring us into the future.

376
00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:32.138
Doesn't come across that way.

377
00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:33.835
Why?

378
00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:35.402
Because I'm not in some
perfect relationship

379
00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:38.318
or I don't have a little
electric toothbrush

380
00:17:38.492 --> 00:17:40.972
thinga-ma-bobs dangling
out of my ears?

381
00:17:41.147 --> 00:17:42.452
You know what?

382
00:17:42.626 --> 00:17:45.629
I have to admit.
I agree with Dad.

383
00:17:45.803 --> 00:17:49.068
But the only person who seems
to matter to you is you.

384
00:17:49.242 --> 00:17:51.200
You have no interest in
inheriting this company

385
00:17:51.374 --> 00:17:53.159
and passing it on
to your children.

386
00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:55.944
You're this rogue bachelor
with rogue ideas

387
00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:58.860
and it would take a PR miracle

388
00:17:59.034 --> 00:18:00.862
for you to change your image

389
00:18:01.036 --> 00:18:03.908
and sway Dad's or anyone
else's vote.

390
00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.694
Wow. Ok. thank you. sis.

391
00:18:09.392 --> 00:18:13.962
No. no. no.
Actually. thank you.

392
00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:16.138
Yeah. Thank you. thank you!

393
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.143
Nice to see you again.
Nolan.

394
00:18:21.317 --> 00:18:23.319
You too. Luna. So this
is the museum.

395
00:18:23.493 --> 00:18:24.842
So. what do you think?

396
00:18:25.016 --> 00:18:26.627
You could focus on how
the old boathouse

397
00:18:26.801 --> 00:18:27.976
was gonna be demolished
and my dad and his friends

398
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.108
formed the Preservation
Society.

399
00:18:29.282 --> 00:18:31.066
Which later became this museum.

400
00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.069
Or the pirate exhibition
is always a crowd pleaser.

401
00:18:36.027 --> 00:18:38.160
And the wedding?

402
00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:42.251
Oh. Like I said over the phone.
there is no engagement.

403
00:18:42.425 --> 00:18:45.036
But the museum. you said
you'd love to check it out.

404
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:46.864
I thought you could still
run a piece on it.

405
00:18:47.038 --> 00:18:48.692
Yeah. sorry. Luna.

406
00:18:48.866 --> 00:18:51.042
I wish I could but it's just
not the kind of thing

407
00:18:51.217 --> 00:18:53.044
my editor would go for.

408
00:18:53.219 --> 00:18:55.177
I know you said you're
retracting your press release.

409
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:59.399
but I see that all the time
with society pages.

410
00:18:59.573 --> 00:19:02.924
Secret weddings.
someone leaks an invitation.

411
00:19:03.098 --> 00:19:05.970
or the bride is marrying into
that world

412
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:11.237
and has no idea about keeping on
the down low so she retracts.

413
00:19:11.411 --> 00:19:12.412
Nope.

414
00:19:12.586 --> 00:19:14.936
Just me.

415
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:16.720
And these old boats.

416
00:19:18.026 --> 00:19:20.550
Luna. I just got a call from...

417
00:19:20.724 --> 00:19:23.118
Oh. he's here.

418
00:19:23.292 --> 00:19:25.903
Hey. honey.
How are you?

419
00:19:26.077 --> 00:19:27.731
-Hey!
-Hey.

420
00:19:27.905 --> 00:19:28.515
Nolan Elias. Been a minute.
Good to see you. bud.

421
00:19:28.689 --> 00:19:29.994
It has.

422
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:32.867
Wow. well. I trust you heard
the news.

423
00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:34.869
She's a keeper. this one.

424
00:19:35.043 --> 00:19:39.090
I was just saying to Nolan
there is no wedding.

425
00:19:39.265 --> 00:19:40.831
-Is that what she told you?
-Yeah.

426
00:19:41.005 --> 00:19:43.573
-Come on.
-I did wonder.

427
00:19:43.747 --> 00:19:47.273
It would make a great story.
Jackson Valentine.

428
00:19:47.447 --> 00:19:48.839
The world has been
waiting for him.

429
00:19:49.013 --> 00:19:50.885
for you. to settle down.

430
00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:54.018
Well. isn't it about time they
knew that I was capable of it.

431
00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:57.239
Would you excuse us a minute?

432
00:19:57.413 --> 00:19:59.023
Just a second.

433
00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:01.939
What are you doing?

434
00:20:02.113 --> 00:20:03.767
Ok. hear me out.

435
00:20:03.941 --> 00:20:05.378
You said that you could use
the publicity. right?

436
00:20:05.552 --> 00:20:08.555
And I could use a bit of
a public image overhaul.

437
00:20:08.729 --> 00:20:10.513
We can't just pretend
we're engaged.

438
00:20:10.687 --> 00:20:12.298
Why not?

439
00:20:12.472 --> 00:20:14.213
Let this guy write his story.
it gets published.

440
00:20:14.387 --> 00:20:15.736
we both get what we want

441
00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.217
and then we have a very
public break up.

442
00:20:18.391 --> 00:20:20.175
Boom. Even more publicity.
right?

443
00:20:20.349 --> 00:20:22.569
This is completely unethical.
I know this reporter.

444
00:20:22.743 --> 00:20:24.266
He's an old friend of mine.

445
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.050
Then you can tell your
old friend afterward.

446
00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:27.400
Luna. this is the way
of the world.

447
00:20:27.574 --> 00:20:29.880
Not my world.

448
00:20:30.054 --> 00:20:32.535
As far as I can see.
your world might not exist

449
00:20:32.709 --> 00:20:34.929
in a couple weeks without
a mega publicity push.

450
00:20:35.103 --> 00:20:37.366
There are other ways.

451
00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.891
Well. I think that a million
Jackson Valentine followers

452
00:20:41.065 --> 00:20:43.111
say this is a pretty good one.

453
00:20:45.156 --> 00:20:47.420
What do you say?
Will you marry me?

454
00:20:47.594 --> 00:20:49.509
Get up! Get up!

455
00:20:52.381 --> 00:20:53.730
Fine.

456
00:20:53.904 --> 00:20:55.254
But just until the article
comes out.

457
00:20:55.428 --> 00:20:56.994
And until then we don't tell
a soul.

458
00:20:57.168 --> 00:20:58.387
Deal.

459
00:21:18.494 --> 00:21:19.713
Oh. so sorry about that.

460
00:21:19.887 --> 00:21:21.062
My fiancée needed
some convincing.

461
00:21:21.236 --> 00:21:22.629
She's not used
to the limelight.

462
00:21:23.456 --> 00:21:26.110
-Mom.
-Fiancée? You're engaged?

463
00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:29.592
It's. uh. ok. Mom.

464
00:21:29.766 --> 00:21:32.378
You don't have to keep it
secret anymore.

465
00:21:32.552 --> 00:21:34.858
She's so loyal.

466
00:21:35.032 --> 00:21:36.947
Fiercely loyal.

467
00:21:37.121 --> 00:21:39.994
Right. What a relief
to say it out loud.

468
00:21:40.168 --> 00:21:42.953
My future son-in-law
is Jackson Valentine.

469
00:21:43.127 --> 00:21:44.607
Mom.

470
00:21:44.781 --> 00:21:47.001
Oh. it's so good to see you.
How are you?

471
00:21:47.175 --> 00:21:50.047
So. you'll do the article?

472
00:21:50.221 --> 00:21:52.441
Better. We'll do
an exclusive.

473
00:21:52.615 --> 00:21:54.095
Super.

474
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:55.662
Why don't we sit down
sometime next week?

475
00:21:55.836 --> 00:21:57.316
Sounds great.

476
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.057
A weekend feature on us.

477
00:22:00.231 --> 00:22:02.495
-Wow.
-Wow.

478
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:04.192
Wow.

479
00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:06.455
I bet everyone's dying
for the inside scoop.

480
00:22:06.629 --> 00:22:09.066
Maybe you can fill me in
over lunch?

481
00:22:14.463 --> 00:22:20.426
Garlic knots from Sunflower.
Chicken Francese. arancini...

482
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.297
Mom. Stop.

483
00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:24.081
Stop what? I'm putting out
the food.

484
00:22:24.255 --> 00:22:26.127
Jackson. you have to try some.
It's the best.

485
00:22:26.301 --> 00:22:27.955
We go there once a week.

486
00:22:28.129 --> 00:22:29.826
I know you're mad.
You're doing the food thing.

487
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.915
When she talks about food
and won't look you in the eye.

488
00:22:32.089 --> 00:22:32.786
Hm.

489
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.396
I'm not mad.

490
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:35.963
I guess. when you're dating
a celebrity

491
00:22:36.137 --> 00:22:37.965
you have to have your secrets.

492
00:22:38.139 --> 00:22:39.662
Blood is thicker than water.

493
00:22:39.836 --> 00:22:41.360
I would have thought you could
at least tell me.

494
00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:43.144
I'm good at keeping secrets.

495
00:22:43.318 --> 00:22:44.537
Look how good I played along
with that reporter.

496
00:22:44.711 --> 00:22:46.016
Mom. it's not like that.

497
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.627
I don't see what else
it could be.

498
00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:48.628
When your own daughter
doesn't say a word

499
00:22:48.802 --> 00:22:51.021
about her secret life.

500
00:22:51.195 --> 00:22:53.894
Granted. I was out of town
with Dominic.

501
00:22:54.068 --> 00:22:56.026
Out of sight out of mind.
I guess.

502
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.681
Oh. you know. uh. it's.
it's all my fault.

503
00:22:58.855 --> 00:23:01.336
Actually. you know.
she. she wanted to tell you.

504
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.512
In fact. she begged me
to let her tell you

505
00:23:03.686 --> 00:23:07.603
but we wanted to wait
until lobster night.

506
00:23:07.777 --> 00:23:12.173
Yeah. when we would just tell
everyone as one big family.

507
00:23:12.347 --> 00:23:13.174
Lobster night?

508
00:23:13.348 --> 00:23:15.176
Yeah.

509
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.831
You know how much
I love lobster.

510
00:23:18.005 --> 00:23:19.354
This is wonderful.

511
00:23:19.528 --> 00:23:22.009
My baby's getting married!

512
00:23:22.183 --> 00:23:25.186
Oh. I'm so happy.
I'm so happy.

513
00:23:27.493 --> 00:23:30.060
Let's eat. let's eat. let's eat!

514
00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:34.238
Thank you. again. for all
the food. Mrs. Morelli.

515
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:36.632
Oh. please.
Call me mom.

516
00:23:36.806 --> 00:23:39.374
I'll see you both
at lobster night! Woo!

517
00:23:41.158 --> 00:23:42.333
Lobster night?

518
00:23:42.508 --> 00:23:43.813
Yeah. what?

519
00:23:43.987 --> 00:23:45.206
Isn't that what you nautical
types do?

520
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.425
We agreed this was going
no further

521
00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:48.470
than you. me and Nolan Elias.

522
00:23:48.644 --> 00:23:51.517
Wait. then why did you encourage
me to bring my parents into it?

523
00:23:51.691 --> 00:23:53.170
When did I do that?

524
00:23:53.344 --> 00:23:55.564
When you were doing the whole
like. mm...

525
00:23:55.738 --> 00:23:57.479
If you got off your phone
and spent more time interacting

526
00:23:57.653 --> 00:24:00.351
with actual humans. you might be
better at reading eyebrows.

527
00:24:00.526 --> 00:24:02.310
Look. could you not see that
her heart was shattering

528
00:24:02.484 --> 00:24:04.878
into a million pieces
on the museum floor?

529
00:24:05.052 --> 00:24:07.010
'Cause her only daughter
got engaged

530
00:24:07.184 --> 00:24:08.751
without sharing it with her.

531
00:24:08.925 --> 00:24:11.275
Ok. but I think I came up
with the perfect excuse.

532
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.190
Plus. wouldn't it look
a little suspicious

533
00:24:13.364 --> 00:24:15.366
if my own parents didn't know
about our engagement?

534
00:24:15.541 --> 00:24:16.890
Fine.

535
00:24:17.064 --> 00:24:19.240
Your parents and then
no one else.

536
00:24:19.414 --> 00:24:20.937
Ok.

537
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:23.984
♪

538
00:24:24.158 --> 00:24:25.942
And your job is...?

539
00:24:26.116 --> 00:24:29.555
CEO I guess?
You taking notes?

540
00:24:29.729 --> 00:24:32.514
Just being prepared.

541
00:24:32.688 --> 00:24:35.038
How long would you say
we've been together?

542
00:24:35.212 --> 00:24:36.562
Four months.

543
00:24:37.693 --> 00:24:39.434
You think you'd know me
well enough to marry me

544
00:24:39.608 --> 00:24:42.002
after just four months?

545
00:24:42.176 --> 00:24:44.091
I think I would know
after four minutes.

546
00:24:44.265 --> 00:24:46.093
if I had a future
with someone.

547
00:24:46.267 --> 00:24:48.095
After four minutes. yeah.

548
00:24:52.229 --> 00:24:54.449
Are you sure this isn't going
a little far?

549
00:24:54.623 --> 00:24:55.972
Can you even return
an engagement ring?

550
00:24:56.146 --> 00:24:57.844
They're expensive.

551
00:24:58.018 --> 00:24:59.149
I know. but what's the first
thing that someone does

552
00:24:59.323 --> 00:25:00.194
when a woman says
she's engaged.

553
00:25:00.368 --> 00:25:01.630
They look at her hand.

554
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.243
Don't you think a real ring
takes it to another level?

555
00:25:06.417 --> 00:25:07.723
I hear you.

556
00:25:07.897 --> 00:25:10.987
I do. but would not
having a ring

557
00:25:11.161 --> 00:25:12.859
bring up even more questions?

558
00:25:13.033 --> 00:25:14.469
Which would lead
to even more lies.

559
00:25:14.643 --> 00:25:17.428
We. we want to be convincing.
right?

560
00:25:17.603 --> 00:25:19.082
I guess a ring
keeps it simple.

561
00:25:19.256 --> 00:25:20.475
Yeah.

562
00:25:24.131 --> 00:25:25.828
Well. if it isn't the most
beautiful young lady

563
00:25:26.002 --> 00:25:29.179
on the island and her fiancé.

564
00:25:29.353 --> 00:25:33.053
You know how it works is you buy
the ring before you propose?

565
00:25:33.227 --> 00:25:34.881
Oh. well look. sometimes
the spirit moves you

566
00:25:35.055 --> 00:25:36.535
and you don't have all
your ducks in a row.

567
00:25:36.709 --> 00:25:37.536
Yeah.

568
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.320
Hi Dominic. How are you?

569
00:25:39.494 --> 00:25:42.453
Jackson. this is Dominic.
my mom's...

570
00:25:42.628 --> 00:25:45.979
I'm the famous boyfriend.

571
00:25:46.153 --> 00:25:48.111
You know. she doesn't want
to meddle.

572
00:25:48.285 --> 00:25:52.159
but before you splash out here.
I know your mother has an idea.

573
00:26:02.256 --> 00:26:03.823
Mom. I can't.

574
00:26:03.997 --> 00:26:04.911
You must.

575
00:26:05.085 --> 00:26:06.565
No. Mom. It's yours.

576
00:26:06.739 --> 00:26:08.610
I want you to have it.

577
00:26:08.784 --> 00:26:11.091
I've had a few years to think
about this and I told myself.

578
00:26:11.265 --> 00:26:14.877
if she ever gets married.
I want her to wear this.

579
00:26:15.051 --> 00:26:16.313
What good is it doing me?

580
00:26:16.487 --> 00:26:17.967
Dad gave it to you. Mom.

581
00:26:18.141 --> 00:26:19.926
Sweetie. I haven't worn it
in years.

582
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.015
You should have it.

583
00:26:22.189 --> 00:26:24.147
And come on. you love
old things.

584
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:25.540
I said no.

585
00:26:25.714 --> 00:26:26.976
This is about Dominic.
isn't it?

586
00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.412
You've never warmed to him.

587
00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:29.370
You know. he's been
very good to me.

588
00:26:29.544 --> 00:26:31.154
It's not about him.

589
00:26:32.634 --> 00:26:34.027
Why do you always bring Dominic
into things

590
00:26:34.201 --> 00:26:35.898
that are between you and me?

591
00:26:36.072 --> 00:26:38.031
You just don't get it.

592
00:26:40.381 --> 00:26:43.906
This is important.
This is serious.

593
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.171
Look. Mom. it's not real.

594
00:26:48.345 --> 00:26:50.870
Of course it's real.
it's platinum.

595
00:26:51.044 --> 00:26:55.918
No. I mean our love.
Jackson and me.

596
00:26:56.092 --> 00:26:57.833
Nonsense.

597
00:26:58.007 --> 00:26:59.922
Look. I know you like your
privacy and I've been trying

598
00:27:00.096 --> 00:27:02.403
to respect that and give you
your space.

599
00:27:02.577 --> 00:27:04.231
but you can't dismiss
what you're feeling

600
00:27:04.405 --> 00:27:08.409
just because other people
want to share in your joy.

601
00:27:08.583 --> 00:27:14.023
This is a time for family
and we are all we have.

602
00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:27.297
It's beautiful.

603
00:27:31.301 --> 00:27:32.912
They demolished
the old lighthouse

604
00:27:33.086 --> 00:27:35.871
and the boat yard was next.

605
00:27:36.045 --> 00:27:38.308
But. my dad organized
local residents.

606
00:27:38.482 --> 00:27:39.353
Wow.

607
00:27:39.527 --> 00:27:41.007
They fought and won.

608
00:27:41.181 --> 00:27:42.399
Good for them.

609
00:27:42.573 --> 00:27:43.749
They set up a preservation
society.

610
00:27:43.923 --> 00:27:46.882
which later became
the museum.

611
00:27:47.056 --> 00:27:47.666
Huh.

612
00:27:49.102 --> 00:27:51.104
Do you want a pen?

613
00:27:51.278 --> 00:27:52.496
What for?

614
00:27:53.497 --> 00:27:55.935
To write this down.

615
00:27:56.109 --> 00:27:57.197
No. it's all up here.

616
00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:05.509
So. if Nolan asks you anything
about where I'd rather be.

617
00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:07.294
this is it.

618
00:28:09.078 --> 00:28:12.168
We have some original newspapers
dating back to 1851.

619
00:28:12.342 --> 00:28:14.301
Did you ever think of updating?

620
00:28:14.475 --> 00:28:17.043
I mean. you can get this
whole collection put on
a server. and...

621
00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:19.349
And whatever
we couldn't source.

622
00:28:19.523 --> 00:28:21.264
we managed to get
on microfiche.

623
00:28:21.438 --> 00:28:23.005
Microfiche?

624
00:28:23.179 --> 00:28:26.487
Yeah. it's like a scanned image
of a newspaper

625
00:28:26.661 --> 00:28:29.011
or a picture of
the original document.

626
00:28:29.185 --> 00:28:30.665
I know what it is.

627
00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:32.188
Wait. they still do that?
In the 21st century?

628
00:28:32.362 --> 00:28:34.016
Not every archive
has had the ability

629
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.498
to convert their film
to digital images.

630
00:28:37.672 --> 00:28:41.067
All I can say is
thank goodness.

631
00:28:41.241 --> 00:28:43.591
Can you believe someone wanted
to throw these away?

632
00:28:43.765 --> 00:28:45.158
No.

633
00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.945
Yeah. I rescued them
from a local library.

634
00:28:50.119 --> 00:28:53.906
Wow. You really do
love microfiche.

635
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.386
I could do this all day.

636
00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.912
But we won't. right? We'll just
kind of... I'm joking.

637
00:29:00.086 --> 00:29:01.174
You know what?

638
00:29:04.177 --> 00:29:05.961
I've got a museum to run.

639
00:29:06.135 --> 00:29:09.051
Well you. you want me
to read all this?

640
00:29:09.225 --> 00:29:12.098
This is my passion.

641
00:29:12.272 --> 00:29:14.230
You can't be my fiancé
without knowing my passion.

642
00:29:14.404 --> 00:29:15.884
Ok.

643
00:29:16.058 --> 00:29:17.756
Well then it's only fair
that you know mine.

644
00:29:27.504 --> 00:29:29.028
Come on. Dig in.

645
00:29:29.202 --> 00:29:31.247
You're scared to get
your hands dirty?

646
00:29:31.421 --> 00:29:33.554
What do we have here?

647
00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:40.213
So. how did you become
an ocean crusader?

648
00:29:40.387 --> 00:29:42.998
Same as a lot of things
I support.

649
00:29:43.172 --> 00:29:44.478
It all started by watching

650
00:29:44.652 --> 00:29:45.871
a couple really powerful
documentaries.

651
00:29:46.045 --> 00:29:48.134
It went from there.

652
00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:49.831
I've never really liked
the attention that I got

653
00:29:50.005 --> 00:29:51.659
from being a Valentine.

654
00:29:51.833 --> 00:29:54.401
Then I realized that you can
use it as a commodity.

655
00:29:54.575 --> 00:29:56.011
You can use it to do things.

656
00:29:56.185 --> 00:29:58.579
Ideally. meaningful things.

657
00:29:58.753 --> 00:30:02.713
Must be pretty tough for you
to live a normal life.

658
00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:06.195
People seem to be more intrigued

659
00:30:06.369 --> 00:30:08.197
whenever there is a pretty
woman around.

660
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.593
Are there a lot of pretty women?

661
00:30:12.767 --> 00:30:15.161
No. there are not.

662
00:30:15.335 --> 00:30:17.946
Too busy to settle down?

663
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:22.995
No. just haven't found the right
woman to settle down with.

664
00:30:23.169 --> 00:30:24.561
I never really felt like anyone
was gonna make

665
00:30:24.735 --> 00:30:26.999
a better man out of me.

666
00:30:27.173 --> 00:30:28.609
What about you?

667
00:30:28.783 --> 00:30:29.915
You ever have time
to tear yourself away

668
00:30:30.089 --> 00:30:31.525
from the paper mites?

669
00:30:31.699 --> 00:30:34.310
Running the museum takes up
most of my time.

670
00:30:34.484 --> 00:30:38.184
I mean. I dated on and off.

671
00:30:38.358 --> 00:30:44.059
The truth is. I haven't really
wanted anything to come of it.

672
00:30:44.233 --> 00:30:47.933
Ever since my dad died
three years ago.

673
00:30:48.107 --> 00:30:49.630
I don't think my heart could
handle it

674
00:30:49.804 --> 00:30:52.024
if something didn't work out.

675
00:30:52.198 --> 00:30:54.330
The necklace.

676
00:30:54.504 --> 00:30:56.942
He has the other one.

677
00:30:57.116 --> 00:30:59.945
Two ships. he used to say.

678
00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:02.295
We just didn't have long enough.

679
00:31:02.469 --> 00:31:04.297
I'm really sorry about your dad.

680
00:31:06.995 --> 00:31:08.170
Thanks.

681
00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:27.886
Hey. question for you
as president

682
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.150
of the so important that you
need ear thingies society.

683
00:31:31.324 --> 00:31:34.196
I'm listening. on
my ear thingies. in fact.

684
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.024
Of course.

685
00:31:36.198 --> 00:31:38.026
Do you think that the end
always justifies the means?

686
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.898
Like in business. I mean.

687
00:31:40.072 --> 00:31:42.335
Well. that depends on the means.

688
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:46.121
If the deal looks good
and it's for a good cause.

689
00:31:46.295 --> 00:31:48.950
yeah. I'm open to shades
of grey.

690
00:31:49.124 --> 00:31:51.083
Why? What's happening
with your Ocean Can.

691
00:31:51.257 --> 00:31:52.954
is it drifting out to sea?

692
00:31:53.128 --> 00:31:55.652
Uh. yeah. I mean. you know
how these things can go.

693
00:31:55.826 --> 00:32:00.048
So listen. can you pick up some
lobsters for tomorrow night?

694
00:32:00.222 --> 00:32:01.963
Jackson Valentine.
what are you up to?

695
00:32:02.137 --> 00:32:03.443
Nothing.

696
00:32:03.617 --> 00:32:05.488
I just want to have
a nice dinner.

697
00:32:05.662 --> 00:32:08.056
Ok. you haven't had dinner with
Mom and Dad in three months

698
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.885
and now suddenly you want
to join us for lobster night?

699
00:32:11.059 --> 00:32:13.279
Is this part of your get Dad
to vote for me plan?

700
00:32:13.453 --> 00:32:15.977
No. of course not.

701
00:32:16.151 --> 00:32:19.372
I just... I've got something
on my mind.

702
00:32:19.546 --> 00:32:23.071
I'm intrigued and excited
to see you.

703
00:32:23.245 --> 00:32:24.943
Dad'll be over the moon.

704
00:32:25.117 --> 00:32:27.989
No. no. no. Don't tell anyone.
Just keep it a secret.

705
00:32:28.163 --> 00:32:31.079
So. lobsters?
Maybe some corn.

706
00:32:33.603 --> 00:32:35.388
Get your own corn.

707
00:32:35.562 --> 00:32:37.564
♪

708
00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:05.592
That is some house.

709
00:33:05.766 --> 00:33:09.465
Don't fawn over them.
And don't get too chatty.

710
00:33:09.639 --> 00:33:11.990
We're staying for an hour. max.

711
00:33:12.164 --> 00:33:13.165
Who's fawning?

712
00:33:13.339 --> 00:33:15.080
He's just making an observation.

713
00:33:15.254 --> 00:33:17.908
And remember to act surprised.

714
00:33:21.086 --> 00:33:22.957
You know. all you need
is one of those

715
00:33:23.131 --> 00:33:25.960
big yellow rubber raincoats like
the guy on the fish stick box

716
00:33:26.134 --> 00:33:27.875
and you'd be ready
for the rough seas.

717
00:33:28.049 --> 00:33:29.398
You said lobster night.

718
00:33:29.572 --> 00:33:31.183
This is what you wear
to lobster night.

719
00:33:31.357 --> 00:33:32.314
Yeah. yeah. yeah.

720
00:33:32.488 --> 00:33:35.013
Look at this place.

721
00:33:35.187 --> 00:33:38.625
No wonder your sister
requested lobster.

722
00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:42.368
-What a lovely surprise.
-Hi Mom.

723
00:33:43.108 --> 00:33:45.197
Did somebody say surprise?

724
00:33:45.371 --> 00:33:47.199
You know. yes.

725
00:33:47.373 --> 00:33:49.853
I actually have an announcement
to make.

726
00:33:50.028 --> 00:33:52.595
This is Luna. my fiancée.

727
00:33:56.077 --> 00:33:57.557
What a surprise!

728
00:33:57.731 --> 00:33:58.688
Ohh!

729
00:34:01.474 --> 00:34:06.131
Uh. well. congratulations.

730
00:34:06.305 --> 00:34:07.610
Thanks. Mom.

731
00:34:09.351 --> 00:34:10.831
You look so familiar.

732
00:34:11.005 --> 00:34:11.832
Does she?

733
00:34:12.006 --> 00:34:14.313
I get that a lot.

734
00:34:14.487 --> 00:34:15.792
How did you two meet?

735
00:34:15.966 --> 00:34:17.925
-On the docks.
-Outside my museum.

736
00:34:18.099 --> 00:34:19.492
By the docks right outside
my museum.

737
00:34:19.666 --> 00:34:21.581
Luna runs a Maritime museum.

738
00:34:21.755 --> 00:34:23.974
She's actually written a book
about our local history.

739
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:26.499
Oh. I'd love to read it.

740
00:34:26.673 --> 00:34:28.153
I head up our
publishing division.

741
00:34:28.327 --> 00:34:30.111
We started with e-books

742
00:34:30.285 --> 00:34:32.548
but these days three-quarters
of our titles go to print.

743
00:34:32.722 --> 00:34:36.030
Sure. maybe.
When it's finished.

744
00:34:36.204 --> 00:34:38.206
Well. I think a toast
is in order.

745
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:42.036
Yes. a toast to the surprising
turn of events.

746
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:46.345
Yes. to the first step on
the road to being a family man.

747
00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:48.260
I bet you never thought
you'd see the day.

748
00:34:48.434 --> 00:34:49.435
Well. frankly. I...

749
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:52.090
To Luna and Jackson.

750
00:34:52.264 --> 00:34:53.569
Yes.

751
00:34:57.443 --> 00:34:59.575
You can almost see the old
lookout from here.

752
00:34:59.749 --> 00:35:04.232
My dad was heartbroken when they
demolished the old lighthouse.

753
00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:08.193
So. he petitioned the town to
mark the spot where it stood.

754
00:35:08.367 --> 00:35:11.587
Part of the deal was once
a month they'd cast a light

755
00:35:11.761 --> 00:35:15.113
in the old lookout to honor
the way the lighthouse

756
00:35:15.287 --> 00:35:17.289
used to help guide ships home.

757
00:35:17.463 --> 00:35:19.987
Of course ships couldn't always
trust them.

758
00:35:20.161 --> 00:35:22.946
Yes. There were folks known
as the "wreckers".

759
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:24.209
The most famous one being?

760
00:35:24.383 --> 00:35:26.036
Jeremiah Smith.

761
00:35:28.474 --> 00:35:31.390
Legend has it. he'd build these
huge fires on the beach

762
00:35:31.564 --> 00:35:34.001
that ships would mistake
for a lighthouse.

763
00:35:34.175 --> 00:35:38.048
Luring them ashore. so when
they get stuck on the sandbar.

764
00:35:38.223 --> 00:35:39.572
he'd run out to help them.

765
00:35:39.746 --> 00:35:42.488
Or so they thought.

766
00:35:42.662 --> 00:35:44.577
And steal their goods?

767
00:35:45.578 --> 00:35:46.840
The cheek!

768
00:35:47.014 --> 00:35:48.885
He might be an urban
myth though.

769
00:35:49.059 --> 00:35:52.411
I like the theory that he was
real but not the worst of them.

770
00:35:52.585 --> 00:35:55.414
Just got the most publicity.

771
00:35:55.588 --> 00:35:57.329
Sounds familiar.

772
00:35:57.503 --> 00:36:00.941
Whatever the truth is.
I still believe

773
00:36:01.115 --> 00:36:05.815
you can trust a lighthouse
to help guide you home.

774
00:36:05.989 --> 00:36:08.818
How do you know so much
about the wreckers?

775
00:36:08.992 --> 00:36:12.474
Oh. that lighthouse was part of
our view here for years

776
00:36:12.648 --> 00:36:15.173
and when they wanted to
shut down the old boathouse.

777
00:36:15.347 --> 00:36:18.437
we did some work with
the preservation society.

778
00:36:18.611 --> 00:36:20.090
So did my dad.

779
00:36:20.265 --> 00:36:22.441
Gus wouldn't back down
to those developers.

780
00:36:22.615 --> 00:36:23.920
I have some vintage postcards

781
00:36:24.094 --> 00:36:25.879
that I can part with
for your museum.

782
00:36:26.053 --> 00:36:27.924
They're very rare.

783
00:36:28.098 --> 00:36:30.840
I... I couldn't possibly.

784
00:36:31.014 --> 00:36:32.102
Of course you can.

785
00:36:32.277 --> 00:36:34.279
Consider them an
engagement gift.

786
00:36:34.453 --> 00:36:37.847
Um. I should go.

787
00:36:38.021 --> 00:36:40.937
But we're all having such
a nice time.

788
00:36:41.111 --> 00:36:44.114
I just remembered
that I have to paint

789
00:36:44.289 --> 00:36:46.247
one of the exhibition spaces.

790
00:36:46.421 --> 00:36:48.902
We didn't even get to hear
how Jackson proposed.

791
00:36:49.076 --> 00:36:50.860
It's really not that exciting
of a story.

792
00:36:51.034 --> 00:36:53.080
Totally. ho-hum.

793
00:36:53.254 --> 00:36:55.996
I didn't even have a ring.

794
00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.519
-This one's my mom's.
-Yeah.

795
00:36:57.693 --> 00:36:59.434
Doesn't it look great on her?

796
00:36:59.608 --> 00:37:00.827
Come on. tell us.

797
00:37:01.001 --> 00:37:02.524
We'd love to know.

798
00:37:02.698 --> 00:37:11.881
Uh. ok. Well. I proposed
using a clam shell.

799
00:37:12.055 --> 00:37:13.840
You know how I like
my nautical stuff.

800
00:37:14.014 --> 00:37:14.884
Yep.

801
00:37:15.058 --> 00:37:16.799
Really?

802
00:37:16.973 --> 00:37:19.976
You know what. Posey.
Luna and I have been talking.

803
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:21.108
We. we have.

804
00:37:21.282 --> 00:37:23.066
We have.

805
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:26.853
And. and we both think that you
should be Luna's maid of honor.

806
00:37:27.027 --> 00:37:28.942
And. and then you can get
the whole story

807
00:37:29.116 --> 00:37:31.945
of our whirlwind romance when
you're planning the wedding.

808
00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:32.989
Right?

809
00:37:33.163 --> 00:37:36.558
Wow. We'll be sisters.

810
00:37:38.778 --> 00:37:39.822
Right.

811
00:37:39.996 --> 00:37:44.044
♪

812
00:37:47.352 --> 00:37:49.571
How could he not tell me
his sister was coming?

813
00:37:49.745 --> 00:37:52.966
And what does he have
against his parents anyway?

814
00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.534
I knew he was spoilt.

815
00:37:55.708 --> 00:37:57.492
What?

816
00:37:57.666 --> 00:38:00.408
She's rich and important. so of
course the job would go to her.

817
00:38:00.582 --> 00:38:04.020
Ang. are you seriously upset
you're not my maid of honor

818
00:38:04.194 --> 00:38:07.328
for my fake wedding?

819
00:38:07.502 --> 00:38:08.895
When I get married for real

820
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:12.420
you will be my first
and only choice.

821
00:38:12.594 --> 00:38:13.987
Really?

822
00:38:17.469 --> 00:38:19.035
What?

823
00:38:19.209 --> 00:38:21.429
She's actually outside.

824
00:38:21.603 --> 00:38:23.083
Angelina!

825
00:38:23.257 --> 00:38:25.085
Don't let her run away
with the planning.

826
00:38:25.259 --> 00:38:27.870
I know you. you're a people
pleaser and next thing you know

827
00:38:28.044 --> 00:38:31.526
you'll be walking down the aisle
in his mother's dress.

828
00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.573
But. also. be convincing.
Like it's legit.

829
00:38:34.747 --> 00:38:36.270
We need that publicity

830
00:38:36.444 --> 00:38:38.098
or it's really gonna be
lights out here. Lu.

831
00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.275
-Here.
-Ok.

832
00:38:43.103 --> 00:38:45.758
Thanks for making me
the real maid of honor.

833
00:39:02.427 --> 00:39:05.299
It's cute. this place.

834
00:39:05.473 --> 00:39:07.127
Thank you.

835
00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:12.306
You must be really special for
him to consider dropping anchor.

836
00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:13.873
No matter how big
the sea may be.

837
00:39:14.047 --> 00:39:16.005
sometimes two ships meet.

838
00:39:17.442 --> 00:39:19.313
Chinese proverb.

839
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:21.359
Ah.

840
00:39:22.664 --> 00:39:25.450
Jackson and I have a lot
in common.

841
00:39:25.624 --> 00:39:28.844
Oh. like what?

842
00:39:29.018 --> 00:39:31.281
The ocean.

843
00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:33.893
And we both like helping people.

844
00:39:34.067 --> 00:39:37.244
Everybody likes helping people.
It's human nature.

845
00:39:37.418 --> 00:39:41.117
And family matters
to both of us.

846
00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:42.989
He said that?

847
00:39:43.163 --> 00:39:46.558
Yes. he did.
He. he said that.

848
00:39:53.391 --> 00:39:55.001
If you don't start taking
this act seriously

849
00:39:55.175 --> 00:39:56.872
we're gonna tank the interview.

850
00:39:57.046 --> 00:39:59.048
I am taking this seriously.

851
00:39:59.222 --> 00:40:01.834
Come on. a clam shell?

852
00:40:02.008 --> 00:40:05.315
And you might have wanted
to mention

853
00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.100
your sister is joining us

854
00:40:07.274 --> 00:40:09.189
or that you don't actually
get along that well

855
00:40:09.363 --> 00:40:11.278
with your parents.

856
00:40:12.366 --> 00:40:14.063
I need you to hold this stuff.

857
00:40:17.284 --> 00:40:20.200
And. how did you know
about my book?

858
00:40:20.374 --> 00:40:21.984
You didn't want me to know
about your book?

859
00:40:22.158 --> 00:40:23.377
I thought you wanted me
to read it.

860
00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:24.987
It was in one of the folders.

861
00:40:25.161 --> 00:40:29.949
No. I definitely did not
want you to read it.

862
00:40:30.123 --> 00:40:31.907
I don't know how that got
in there.

863
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:34.040
It's not finished.

864
00:40:34.214 --> 00:40:36.042
Well I think it's important
that I know the facts. right?

865
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:41.700
Well. not those kinds
of facts.

866
00:40:49.142 --> 00:40:50.186
Oh. ok.

867
00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:52.014
What are we doing here?

868
00:40:52.188 --> 00:40:53.886
Time to work.

869
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.149
Work? Um...

870
00:40:56.323 --> 00:40:58.630
Where oh where is the fish
stick guy's wardrobe

871
00:40:58.804 --> 00:41:00.240
when you need it?

872
00:41:00.414 --> 00:41:02.851
Don't worry.
it's not that messy.

873
00:41:03.025 --> 00:41:05.854
Ok. just gonna spritz?

874
00:41:06.028 --> 00:41:07.116
Spritz away.

875
00:41:10.163 --> 00:41:12.208
Spritz and swish.
All right.

876
00:41:15.081 --> 00:41:18.911
This was my dad's.
He restored it.

877
00:41:19.085 --> 00:41:22.131
Everyone else saw a piece
of scrap.

878
00:41:22.305 --> 00:41:24.264
He saw a project.

879
00:41:24.438 --> 00:41:27.920
Wow. He really was great.

880
00:41:28.094 --> 00:41:30.618
He spent 30 years
teaching history.

881
00:41:30.792 --> 00:41:34.404
The museum and this boat
were his hobby on the weekend.

882
00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:37.625

He never got a chance
to finish it.

884
00:41:41.237 --> 00:41:42.935
So. I dusted off his plans

885
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:46.416
and I've been working on it
little by little.

886
00:41:46.591 --> 00:41:49.985
He loved old things.

887
00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:52.292
Is that why you're so interested
in history?

888
00:41:53.293 --> 00:41:54.860
Yeah.

889
00:41:56.122 --> 00:41:58.037
If people could see how much
of what we love now

890
00:41:58.211 --> 00:42:00.822
comes from the past.

891
00:42:00.996 --> 00:42:02.215
maybe they'd work
a little harder

892
00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:03.651
to make sure it doesn't
get lost.

893
00:42:07.612 --> 00:42:10.136
Anyway. it's just
a few more repairs

894
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:14.444
and she'll be ready
for a test run.

I came here because I thought it
would be better...

You just can't choose

I don't want a party.
We don't want a party.

963
00:46:12.117 --> 00:46:13.379
This'll give us a good idea

964
00:46:13.553 --> 00:46:14.162
of the kinds of questions
he'll ask.

965
00:46:14.336 --> 00:46:15.773
Hey. look.

966
00:46:15.947 --> 00:46:16.948
I. I know the engagement
party's kind of awkward.

967
00:46:17.122 --> 00:46:18.253
but I do think it'll give him

968
00:46:18.427 --> 00:46:19.907
the last bit of evidence
he needs.

969
00:46:20.081 --> 00:46:21.387
No going back now.

970
00:46:26.566 --> 00:46:28.220
-Wait a minute.
-What?

971
00:46:28.394 --> 00:46:30.918
-Isn't that your dad?
-Yeah. it is.

972
00:46:31.092 --> 00:46:33.094
He didn't just work for
the preservation society.

973
00:46:33.268 --> 00:46:35.444
he largely funded it.

974
00:46:35.618 --> 00:46:38.186
I bet we'll find loads more
about this in the Island Post.

975
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:45.759
You have a letter.

976
00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.331
That's from my dad.

977
00:46:54.159 --> 00:46:57.640
This place is full of them.
it's like a scavenger hunt.

978
00:46:57.815 --> 00:47:03.081
The first one was
a complete surprise.

979
00:47:03.255 --> 00:47:05.823
I found it about three weeks
after his funeral.

980
00:47:05.997 --> 00:47:07.259
Fell out of one of
my favorite books.

981
00:47:07.433 --> 00:47:08.869
Then a few weeks later.

982
00:47:09.043 --> 00:47:11.480
I was rearranging some artifacts
in a display

983
00:47:11.654 --> 00:47:14.527
and found another one.

984
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:16.442
That's such a nice thing to do.

985
00:47:16.616 --> 00:47:19.097
After a few months I stopped
finding them.

986

That was it.

987
00:47:21.099 --> 00:47:23.928
So. I keep them exactly
where I found them.

988
00:47:24.102 --> 00:47:29.194
Just. so it's never over.

five or six

you wanted to climb to the top.

It looked like the stairs
went on forever.

1012

Sure enough. about 50 steps up.
my legs turned to Jell-O.

that I was no longer behind you

1015

and Mom started yelling

1016
00:49:32.186 --> 00:49:35.842
and Posey started telling me
to muster.

1017
00:49:36.016 --> 00:49:39.411
And I froze and then
I heard steps

1018
00:49:39.585 --> 00:49:42.892
coming down those
metal stairs.

1019
00:49:43.067 --> 00:49:44.416
I pulled my head
out of my hands

1020
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:47.941
and I realized that
they were yours.

1021
00:49:48.115 --> 00:49:51.423
You went up and down
those stairs twice that day.

1022
00:49:51.597 --> 00:49:53.599
You even carried me
when I didn't think

1023
00:49:53.773 --> 00:49:56.863
that I could make it
any further.

1024
00:49:57.037 --> 00:50:01.302
I guess I hoped that even if
they tore that lighthouse down.

1025
00:50:01.476 --> 00:50:04.088
you still would be the father
that would look after me.

1026
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.800
I have to admit.

1027
00:50:20.974 --> 00:50:23.020

messing with you.

1031
00:50:29.287 --> 00:50:31.941
but I can tell he really
likes you.

1032
00:50:32.116 --> 00:50:34.074

1033
00:50:34.248 --> 00:50:36.903

Oh. come now.

1040
00:50:55.356 --> 00:50:56.923
Have I been around that long?

1041
00:50:57.097 --> 00:51:00.492
Sorry it's just. you are
my absolute heroine.

1042
00:51:00.666 --> 00:51:03.016
Dog eared doesn't begin

Very well-loved.

1047
00:51:12.025 --> 00:51:13.374
Jack said you were a fan
and I thought.

1048
00:51:13.548 --> 00:51:15.855
wait a minute.
Luna's a writer too.

1049
00:51:16.029 --> 00:51:18.075
She's written an amazing book.

1050
00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:19.989
You've read my book?

1051
00:51:20.164 --> 00:51:21.339
Well yeah. Jack
gave it to me.

1052
00:51:21.513 --> 00:51:22.992
Not only have I read it.

1053
00:51:23.167 --> 00:51:25.125
but I'm adding it to
our publishing slate.

Yes.

Went to public school.

1080
00:52:29.058 --> 00:52:30.495
Uh. you went to college upstate

1081

Your ideal night out

Maybe even better.

1103

I haven't even written
the last chapter.

1104

You know. I have some ideas
about that.

1105
00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.897
What if you used it
as an opportunity

1106
00:53:25.071 --> 00:53:26.594
to talk about the present.

1107
00:53:26.768 --> 00:53:29.293

for future generations.

1108

Ok. I just...

But she's offering you
a publishing deal. Luna.

the museum.

1116

Yeah.

Jeremiah Smith would wait.

a land pirate was a lighthouse.

Yes. he's a fighter.
He's one of the good guys.

everyone's gonna think
that I'm a jerk.

1305
01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.954
Yeah. The break up. yeah.

1306
01:03:48.128 --> 01:03:51.653
It should be all me because the
things that are important to me

just don't seem important
to you.

something like

reality check. or...

01:04:43.401 --> 01:04:45.882
Fake it. but be warned.
you'll never quite make it.

1330

Luna. no. I'm sorry.
This was all my idea.

1331

I was trying to imagine
a better way to-

1332
01:04:52.105 --> 01:04:56.544
No. I went with it because
I care about this place.

1333
01:04:59.504 --> 01:05:00.766
And I still do.

1334
01:05:15.215 --> 01:05:16.913
Jack. what are you doing
out here?

1335
01:05:17.087 --> 01:05:19.872
You're gonna be late
for your own party.

1336
01:05:20.046 --> 01:05:21.308
Have you ever been on the verge
of closing a deal

1337
01:05:21.482 --> 01:05:23.093
that you've been working
really hard on

1338
01:05:23.267 --> 01:05:25.530
and then all of a sudden
it just doesn't feel right?

1339
01:05:25.704 --> 01:05:27.053
Yeah. and you want
to pull out

1340
01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:28.315
but you feel like
it's gotten personal?

1341
01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:29.403
Exactly.

1342
01:05:29.577 --> 01:05:31.579
It isn't... personal.

1343
01:05:31.753 --> 01:05:33.973
It's still business Jack.
it's always business.

1344
01:05:34.147 --> 01:05:35.932
I don't know. Posey.

1345
01:05:36.106 --> 01:05:39.326

it cut straight to my core.

1346
01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.373
Ok. wait. are we. um.
are we still talking

1347
01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:46.986
about those Ocean Can guys?

1348
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.075
I can't lie to you anymore.

1349
01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:53.906
Luna and I aren't engaged.

1350
01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.560
I just met her down on the docks

1351
01:05:55.734 --> 01:05:57.518
and she accidentally put me
in her newsletter

1352
01:05:57.692 --> 01:05:59.433
and then when Dad said that
he wasn't gonna vote for me

1353
01:05:59.607 --> 01:06:01.914
I grabbed at the opportunity
to prove him wrong.

1354
01:06:02.088 --> 01:06:04.177
except now he thinks
that we're an actual couple.

1355
01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:06.832
Jackson Valentine. you didn't.

1356
01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:11.184

you'd look like some family man?

1357
01:06:11.358 --> 01:06:13.708
So we'd vote you
onto the board?

1358
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:18.235
The vote you should have been
worrying about was mine.

1359
01:06:18.409 --> 01:06:21.020
I'm glad I decided
not to back you.

1360
01:06:21.194 --> 01:06:23.501
I need to think about
the future. Jack.

1361
01:06:23.675 --> 01:06:26.069
I need the company
to be stable.

1362
01:06:28.201 --> 01:06:31.988
I need to think about what's
best for my family and for me.

1363
01:06:32.162 --> 01:06:35.121
The family that I haven't really
been a part of for a long time.

1364
01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:40.083
I'm really sorry. Posey.

1365
01:06:40.257 --> 01:06:41.998
I think you're right about me.

1366
01:06:42.172 --> 01:06:45.175
I usually am.

1367
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:48.265
I'm more interested in being
right than doing right.

1368
01:06:48.439 --> 01:06:50.049
I just know you and Dad.

1369
01:06:50.223 --> 01:06:55.315
and if you both wanted to.
you... you know.

1370
01:06:55.489 --> 01:06:58.449
Yeah. I do know. but
it's complicated and...

1371
01:07:02.757 --> 01:07:05.151
There's more to life than
being on the board. right?

1372
01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:07.284
And if I want to pursue
the board seat

1373
01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:11.201
then I can find
an honest way.

1374
01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:15.161
Hey. for what it's worth?

1375
01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:17.468
You may have just swayed
my vote.

1376
01:07:19.165 --> 01:07:21.080
Life begins. right?

1377
01:07:22.081 --> 01:07:22.951
Thanks.

1378
01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:24.127

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.822
They believe us.

1402
01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:54.652
Not only do they believe us
but they believe in us.

1403
01:08:54.826 --> 01:08:57.916
They all want very. very badly
for us to be happy.

1404
01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:00.788
They're going to be
so disappointed.

1405
01:09:00.962 --> 01:09:03.748
What if it's true.
like real.

1406
01:09:05.532 --> 01:09:08.100
What are you talking about?
That's crazy.

1407
01:09:08.274 --> 01:09:09.928
Is it. though? Is it really
that crazy?

1408
01:09:10.102 --> 01:09:13.018
I mean. we. we have been
spending all this time together

1409
01:09:13.192 --> 01:09:15.716
and you're a very special person
to me.

1410
01:09:18.502 --> 01:09:20.417
You can't start a relationship
based on a lie.

1411
01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:22.810
That's wrong. that's not real.

1412
01:09:22.984 --> 01:09:25.552
It feels pretty real to me.

1413
01:09:25.726 --> 01:09:26.945
It does.

1414
01:09:27.119 --> 01:09:28.338
And. and we can go back in there

1415
01:09:28.512 --> 01:09:30.253
and we can have them
celebrate us

1416
01:09:30.427 --> 01:09:32.907
and all that we are and
they would be none the wiser.

1417
01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.909
Oh.

1418
01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:37.173
Isn't that convenient.

1419
01:09:37.347 --> 01:09:40.524
Celebrate this supposed us.

1420
01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:44.136
rather than waste
this great party. huh?

1421
01:09:45.659 --> 01:09:46.660
Luna.

1422
01:09:47.226 --> 01:09:48.880
Luna. I think you're
misunderstanding.

1423
01:09:49.054 --> 01:09:52.231
As your mother would say.
takes one to know one. right?

1424
01:09:52.405 --> 01:09:54.451
Someone in love.

1425
01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:59.151
The two of you and
me and your mother.

1426
01:09:59.325 --> 01:10:01.197
You know. Dominic. I think
she's just speechless

1427
01:10:01.371 --> 01:10:02.285
because it's all so special.

1428
01:10:02.459 --> 01:10:05.549
No. I'm sorry.

1429
01:10:05.723 --> 01:10:07.942
No.

1430
01:10:13.383 --> 01:10:14.384
It's not what you think.

1431
01:10:14.558 --> 01:10:16.951
Really. It's not what you think.

1432
01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:19.171
We're not engaged.

1433
01:10:20.564 --> 01:10:22.087
We never were.

1434
01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:24.220
I've wanted to tell you.

1435
01:10:25.656 --> 01:10:28.920
My dad trusted me
with this place.

1436
01:10:29.094 --> 01:10:31.488
I just wanted
to make him proud.

1437
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:37.363
I don't think he'd be proud
of me right now.

1438
01:10:37.537 --> 01:10:42.238
This is not how you save
a sinking ship.

1439
01:10:44.109 --> 01:10:45.284
Mom.

1440
01:10:55.816 --> 01:10:57.209
Jack.

1441
01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:01.866
Jackson. Come on!

1442
01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:02.997
You didn't tell her
how you feel?

1443
01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:04.999
Of course I told her.

1444
01:11:05.173 --> 01:11:06.479
She didn't' want to hear it.
Posey.

1445
01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:08.438
Well. it is pretty unforgivable.
you know.

1446
01:11:08.612 --> 01:11:10.091
Faking a relationship
with someone

1447
01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.920
just so they'll vote you
onto the board.

1448
01:11:13.094 --> 01:11:15.053
Maybe she just needs
some time.

1449
01:11:20.188 --> 01:11:21.059
Luna.

1450
01:11:24.062 --> 01:11:25.368
So. it was a business deal?

1451
01:11:25.542 --> 01:11:26.891
No.

1452
01:11:27.065 --> 01:11:28.980
No. what I told you back there
was true.

1453
01:11:29.154 --> 01:11:31.156
I mean. yes. it started off as
a way to get me on the board

1454
01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:32.418
but then I got to know you
and...

1455
01:11:32.592 --> 01:11:34.420
And no matter how you felt.

1456
01:11:34.594 --> 01:11:37.075
you still didn't bother
to tell me the whole truth.

1457
01:11:37.249 --> 01:11:39.469
It was more convenient to
formalize our engagement tonight

1458
01:11:39.643 --> 01:11:41.340
just in time for the board
to vote.

1459
01:11:41.514 --> 01:11:44.996
instead of having a real party
when the time was right.

1460
01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:47.651
You wanted to keep up
the charade.

1461
01:11:47.825 --> 01:11:50.697
I wasn't the only one faking it
for my own personal gain.

1462
01:11:50.871 --> 01:11:53.613
I wasn't doing it for myself.
I was doing it for my father.

1463
01:11:53.787 --> 01:11:55.963
For your father?
That's pretty convenient.

1464
01:11:56.137 --> 01:11:57.530
You say that you want to be
loyal to history.

1465
01:11:57.704 --> 01:12:00.577
but the truth is
you're stuck in the past.

1466
01:12:00.751 --> 01:12:03.101
You've been acting like
you support me.

1467
01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.625
like you care about this place.

1468
01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:08.541
This whole time you've just been
luring me into your selfish plan

1469
01:12:08.715 --> 01:12:10.238
to ensure your own prosperity.

1470
01:12:10.413 --> 01:12:13.329
You know who you are?
Jeremiah Smith.

Jeremiah. Jeremiah Smith?

No. that's right.

1475

Because without seeing how
lucky you are to have one.

1476
01:12:27.125 --> 01:12:29.649

I never understood
the importance of legacy.

Like our family business.

I've decided to give up
on the board seat.

1615

Yeah. I have some other ideas
that I want to pursue

1616

The thing is. I might have
backed you in the end.

1620
