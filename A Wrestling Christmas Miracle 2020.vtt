00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:10.113
synonymous with youth wrestling

8
00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:13.073
in the state of New
Jersey it's Kace Gabriel.

9
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.120
the son of Olympian
Ajax Gabriel.

10
00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:19.688
Kace has been on a torrid track

11
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:21.777
to outdo his champion father.

in the last year and a half.

18
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:48.847
and he has accomplished
this undefeated record

19
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:51.720
without a single practice
before his first match.

20
00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:56.942
Some in the rest willing
elite have been mystified.

21
00:01:56.986 --> 00:02:00.294
Others. including his father
say there's no mystery.

22
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.035
- It's genetics.

23
00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.516

[dramatic holiday music]

33
00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:31.673
Also a standout football player.

34

Kace has terrorized
opposing quarterbacks.

35
00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:36.721

36

the opponent's backfield.

With lightening quick
speed and raw. mean muscle.

38
00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:47.384
Kace Gabriel is a
tackling machine

42
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.748
- Now let me tell you who
my favorite NFL player

43
00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:06.534
of all time is. it's
mean Joe Greene.

44
00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:08.231
First. he's mean.

45
00:03:08.275 --> 00:03:11.321
I'm mean. and you have to
be mean to be in the NFL.

46
00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:12.801
Second. he's strong.

47
00:03:12.844 --> 00:03:13.802
I'm strong.

48
00:03:13.845 --> 00:03:15.151
Third. he's fast.

49
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.413
I'm fast.

50
00:03:16.457 --> 00:03:17.719
I also hear he's
a really nice guy.

51
00:03:17.762 --> 00:03:20.025
and I'm a really nice
guy and that's cool.

52
00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.332
But most importantly. he's
the best tackler of all time.

53
00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:24.595
And I'm the best
tackler for my age.

54
00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.988
Watch me tackle this fool.

55
00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:29.818
[man grunting]

56
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:31.428
Now that's a perfect tackle.

57
00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:32.821
I hit him low. I hit him hard.

58
00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:35.389
Now you're gonna see
a lot more of that.

59
00:03:35.432 --> 00:03:37.347
- [Announcer] Yes.
Kace Gabriel has done

60
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:39.523
a lot of tackling on
the football field.

61
00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:43.223
He would surely make
mean Joe Greene proud.

62
00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:48.576
But it's wrestling first
for this young man.

63
00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.665
That fast and mean hard hitting

64
00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:52.580
is even more
powerful on the mat.

65
00:03:54.277 --> 00:03:56.758
What impresses his wrestling
enthusiasts the most

66
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:59.369
is that Kace's winning
formula seems to be

67
00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:02.242
rooted in the mastering
of certain key moves.

68
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.639
The arm drag. the
front headlock.

69
00:04:08.683 --> 00:04:13.427
a legal body slam. a head
smash. and a half nelson.

70
00:04:15.907 --> 00:04:17.692
It's not these core moves alone

71
00:04:17.735 --> 00:04:21.652
that I've made Kace Gabriel
into a champion. it's hard work.

72
00:04:23.524 --> 00:04:26.178
Once Kace blasted onto
the wrestling scene

73
00:04:26.222 --> 00:04:29.356
a day has not gone by
when the now 11 year old

74
00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.400
hasn't worked out.

75
00:04:32.184 --> 00:04:34.665
Some say it's Kace Gabriel's
brute physical strength

76
00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:35.884
that makes him unbeatable.

77
00:04:37.146 --> 00:04:38.016
Ask his father.

78
00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:41.281
- The best wrestler's
a strong wrestler!

79
00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:43.239
That's my son Kace!

80
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.284
- Yeah. oh my god.

81
00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:48.505
[dramatic holiday music]

82
00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:51.334
- [Announcer] So it's
genetics. key mastered moves.

83
00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:53.945
working out. and
physical strength

84
00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:57.297
that has led Kace Gabriel
to 50 consecutive wins.

85
00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:00.865
and one would think
many more to come.

86
00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.216
[dramatic holiday music]

87
00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:10.353
But now this has
all come to an end.

[mischievous music]

90
00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:19.710
- I'm done with wrestling.
at least for now.

91
00:05:19.754 --> 00:05:22.757
- Done with wrestling.
why is that Kace?

92
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.151
Because in 40 days and 40
nights. it's Christmas.

93
00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:27.544
- So?

94
00:05:27.588 --> 00:05:29.894
- My friend has been in
a coma for three months.

95
00:05:29.938 --> 00:05:31.505
and if I make a movie
that will make him laugh

96
00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:33.985
he'll come out of his coma.

97
00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.901
- You're going to make a
movie at only 11 years old

98
00:05:36.945 --> 00:05:39.426
in hopes that your friend
will come out of his coma?

99
00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.124
- Yes. and I'm gonna
write it and direct it

100
00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:43.908
and you have to help me.

101
00:05:43.952 --> 00:05:46.346
[thoughtful music]

102
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:48.826
[transition sound effect]

103
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.785
- I'm sure it's not
the abusive language

104
00:05:50.828 --> 00:05:52.961
towards your patients
that landed you in here.

105
00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:00.664
- I don't know what's
wrong with this clown.

106
00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:04.320
- Agent Truman. you
had something to say?

107
00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:08.193
- You are a complete
mental midget.

108
00:06:08.237 --> 00:06:10.108
You do not have Dr.
Reno in front of you.

109
00:06:11.588 --> 00:06:13.198
- I don't?

110
00:06:13.242 --> 00:06:15.200
- No you don't.

111
00:06:15.244 --> 00:06:18.552
Does the fact that you are
blind also make you stupid.

112
00:06:18.595 --> 00:06:22.294
- You are not Dr. Salvador Reno?

113
00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:23.818
The man who has
surgically removed

114
00:06:23.861 --> 00:06:25.994
that boys tongue in an
experimental procedure

115
00:06:26.037 --> 00:06:28.083
to cure his autism?

116
00:06:28.126 --> 00:06:30.607
- One doesn't cure autism.

117
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:33.001
It's not a disease
Warden Jeffries.

118
00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:36.134
- Oh. it appears I've
made two mistakes.

119
00:06:36.178 --> 00:06:39.355
- The governor made the mistake
in appointing a blind moron

120
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:41.705
the warden of this
unnecessary facility.

121
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:43.838
- I don't find your
mocking of the warden's

122
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:46.057
disability appropriate
Agent Truman.

123
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:49.757
It's rather indignant for
young woman in law enforcement.

124
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.454
- I am not Agent Truman.

125
00:06:51.498 --> 00:06:52.847
I am Agent Sheridan.

126
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.544
I simply translate
Agent Truman's thoughts.

127
00:06:54.588 --> 00:06:56.981
He is a genius with a 180 IQ.

128
00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:02.813
I'm just his mouthpiece.
and I am a nobody.

129
00:07:02.857 --> 00:07:04.424
- And I'm a psychiatrist.

130
00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:06.774
and I can help you with that
narcissism Agent Truman.

131
00:07:06.817 --> 00:07:09.472
- You can't help anything
because you are now a prisoner.

132
00:07:09.516 --> 00:07:11.518
- Stop it. both of you.

133
00:07:11.561 --> 00:07:14.042
Agent Truman. whether
you like it or not.

134
00:07:14.085 --> 00:07:16.044
you still work for me.

135
00:07:16.087 --> 00:07:19.830
And for you. Dr. Caroline Stone.

136
00:07:19.874 --> 00:07:22.267
you are an inmate
in my hospital.

137
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:24.748
Shall we now look at some
of your indiscretions?

138
00:07:26.576 --> 00:07:28.230
[wheelchair squeaks]

139
00:07:28.273 --> 00:07:29.753
- Idiot.

140
00:07:29.797 --> 00:07:31.233
- There you are.

141
00:07:31.276 --> 00:07:32.800
Where have you been?

142
00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:35.759
- Oh. I've been meeting the
doctor. I mean. people. people.

143
00:07:35.803 --> 00:07:38.588
- Oh. so you've probably
met my boss. Agent Truman?

144
00:07:38.632 --> 00:07:39.850
- Yes. I've had that pleasure.

145
00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:42.374
He's the chief of
security. right?

146
00:07:42.418 --> 00:07:46.030
- Ah yes. we're quite lucky
to have that hero here.

147
00:07:46.074 --> 00:07:47.031
- Hero?

148
00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:49.077
- Oh yes. come.

149
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.298
Agent Truman was the
FBI's top field agent.

150
00:07:53.342 --> 00:07:56.171
He took down Jane Gang Green.

151
00:07:56.214 --> 00:08:00.349
broke his neck with
his bare hands.

152
00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:04.875
Every mass murderer he was
the head of investigation on.

153
00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:10.228
but then he was tortured
by that crazy judge

154
00:08:11.665 --> 00:08:13.275
who turned out to
be a serial killer.

155
00:08:13.318 --> 00:08:15.843
- Mm. that's how
he lost his voice.

156
00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:17.279
- No. his mother was a [beep].

157
00:08:19.411 --> 00:08:20.935
- And his legs?

158
00:08:20.978 --> 00:08:24.329
- A boating accident. he
was drunk at the time.

159
00:08:24.373 --> 00:08:29.117
Anyway. welcome to St. Claire's
Correctional Institute.

160
00:08:30.553 --> 00:08:35.123
Day one of your sentence
is officially over.

161
00:08:36.037 --> 00:08:38.039
[ghostly gasping]

162
00:08:38.082 --> 00:08:39.649
- What do you think?

163
00:08:40.737 --> 00:08:42.739
- What were all the beeps for?

164
00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:44.915
- You guys stupidly
used curse words.

165
00:08:46.134 --> 00:08:48.223
- Isn't there foul
language in movies?

166
00:08:48.266 --> 00:08:49.790
- Not movies for
11 year old kids.

167
00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:51.487
- Like Charlie. my best friend.

168
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:53.707
the kid we made the movie for.

169
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.099
- I didn't script
it with curse words.

170
00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:57.362
- You didn't script
it with curse words?

171
00:08:57.406 --> 00:08:59.930
- You know what I mean. when
I oversaw the scripting of it.

172
00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:02.193
- You oversaw the
scripting of it?

173
00:09:02.237 --> 00:09:04.239
- Okay. when you oversaw
the scripting of it.

174
00:09:04.282 --> 00:09:06.502
- Thank you.
- Mom. Dad.

175
00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.199
let's get real here.

176

00:16:12.058 --> 00:16:13.929
left the Christmas
gifts in the car.

351
00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:14.799
- How do you know?

352
00:16:14.843 --> 00:16:16.410
- I have my minions on it.

353
00:16:16.453 --> 00:16:18.803
and your immensely cunning
and gorgeous boyfriend

354
00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:21.371
has a scathingly brilliant plan

355
00:16:21.415 --> 00:16:23.678
to make off with a
Gabriel's Christmas.

356
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:24.984
- Make off?

357
00:16:25.027 --> 00:16:26.072
- And then some.

358
00:16:26.115 --> 00:16:28.726
- [gasps] You mean steal.

359
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.426
- [maniacally chuckles]
I'm a mean one. Kitty Kat.

360
00:16:34.819 --> 00:16:38.388
[both maniacally chuckling]

361
00:16:43.263 --> 00:16:46.048
- [Kitty Kat] Bye.
you big dummy.

362
00:16:46.092 --> 00:16:46.918
[Chuck kisses]
[Kitty Kat kisses]

363
00:16:46.962 --> 00:16:49.617
[Chuck giggling]

364
00:16:52.924 --> 00:16:54.056
- What?

365
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.232
- They're all gone.

366
00:16:56.276 --> 00:16:58.321
- Ronald. how could you
leave the door unlocked?

367
00:16:58.365 --> 00:16:59.757
All of Kace's
presents are in there.

368
00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:01.063
He's gonna be so disappointed.

369
00:17:01.107 --> 00:17:01.977
- The movie.

370
00:17:03.022 --> 00:17:03.848
- Wait. what?

371
00:17:05.241 --> 00:17:07.200
- The presents. the
movie. it's all gone.

372
00:17:07.243 --> 00:17:08.549
- Yeah. but you made copies.

373
00:17:09.898 --> 00:17:10.725
- Can I get a brew?

374
00:17:11.813 --> 00:17:13.641
- Ronald Duncan McNulty.

375
00:17:13.684 --> 00:17:15.251
tell me that you made
copies of this movie.

376
00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:18.080
- Yeah. I made copies. but
I didn't make any copies.

377
00:17:18.124 --> 00:17:21.823
[violin holiday music]

378
00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:24.086
- You better pray that Ajax
is not on top of an elephant.

379
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.219
[violin holiday music]

380
00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:27.176
- What's going on. Mom?

381
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.135
- Kace. go get ready for dinner.

382
00:17:29.178 --> 00:17:30.223
- It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

383
00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:31.876
- Then go get ready for a snack.

384
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.269
Your uncle and I are busy.

385
00:17:33.313 --> 00:17:34.575
- Well. you could just say.

386
00:17:34.618 --> 00:17:36.968
"Please give you uncle
and I some privacy."

387
00:17:37.012 --> 00:17:39.536
- He's so polite.
such a good boy.

388
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.755
- Kace. now.

389
00:17:43.192 --> 00:17:45.890
- You know. you raised
him so well. sis.

390
00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:49.459
You know. his uncle.
I love him. you know?

391
00:17:49.503 --> 00:17:50.895
- [Operator] All
circuits are busy.

392
00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:52.593
Please try your
call again later.

393
00:17:52.636 --> 00:17:54.247
- Damn it.

394
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.639
[sighs] You better
start texting.

395
00:17:55.683 --> 00:17:56.901
and I'm gonna keep dialing

396
00:17:56.945 --> 00:17:58.599
and we both better
start praying.

397
00:17:58.642 --> 00:17:59.904
- [Operator] All
circuits are busy.

398
00:17:59.948 --> 00:18:00.818
- Wow.

399
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.777
- Wow!
- Wow.

400
00:18:04.431 --> 00:18:05.867
- Cool!
[giggling]

401
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.477

[Chuck laughing]
[Kitty coughing]

403
00:18:08.957 --> 00:18:10.263
Wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

404
00:18:10.306 --> 00:18:11.568
Kitty. Kitty.

405
00:18:11.612 --> 00:18:14.093
- I wanna be cowboy.
[Chuck laughing]

406
00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:15.659
- Gnomies! [laughs]

407
00:18:15.703 --> 00:18:17.661
- Really. gnomies?
- Gnomies!

408
00:18:17.705 --> 00:18:19.010
[both laughing]

409
00:18:19.054 --> 00:18:20.664
Hey. look. video games.

410
00:18:20.708 --> 00:18:22.492
- Hey. this drive should work

411
00:18:22.536 --> 00:18:25.191
in our supposedly smart TV.

412
00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:29.891
- Don't we need. like. controls
or somethin'. a joystick?

413
00:18:29.934 --> 00:18:30.718
- Really?

414
00:18:30.761 --> 00:18:34.287
[classical music]

415
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.507
[Kitty imitates gun shots]

[groups chattering]

417
00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:46.125
[gavel banging]

418
00:18:52.783 --> 00:18:53.741
- Record this sentence.

419
00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:59.442
We were friends once.

420
00:18:59.486 --> 00:19:01.357
You were once pillars
of the community.

421
00:19:01.401 --> 00:19:03.490
Hence. the reason why
I've decided to render

422
00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:06.884
the judgment here. at this
hospital that you destroyed.

423
00:19:06.928 --> 00:19:09.235
instead of my courtroom.
where you made a mockery.

424
00:19:09.278 --> 00:19:11.976
[Kitty laughing]
[Chuck growling]

425
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.284
- Oh jolly good jelly.
it's Kace's movie!

426
00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:17.156
- It's our movie.

427
00:19:17.199 --> 00:19:19.332
[Chuck imitates robotic beeping]

428
00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:21.377
[Chuck imitates dial winding]

429
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:24.250
Ah-oo-gah!
[Kitty laughing]

430
00:19:24.293 --> 00:19:26.991
- We did do a good job
in defending ourselves.

431
00:19:27.035 --> 00:19:28.341
[group laughing]

432
00:19:28.384 --> 00:19:31.561
- No. no. you didn't. Dr. Lemon.

433
00:19:31.605 --> 00:19:34.042
Did you notice how the
prosecuting attorney

434
00:19:34.085 --> 00:19:37.132
used you closing
argument verbatim as
his closing argument?

435
00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:38.742
- That is not true
in your honor.

436
00:19:38.786 --> 00:19:41.571
I wrote my submission first
and he's stole it from me.

437
00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:43.269
- What you talkin' 'bout Willis?

438
00:19:43.312 --> 00:19:45.706
[both laughing]

439
00:19:45.749 --> 00:19:48.012
It takes different strokes
for different blokes.

440
00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:49.405
[both laughing]

441
00:19:49.449 --> 00:19:52.582
- You are amazing Chuckles.
[Chuck laughing]

[transition sound effect]

443
00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:54.976
- I did take some liberties.

444
00:19:55.019 --> 00:19:57.239
- You arrogant.
condescending [beep]

445
00:19:57.283 --> 00:19:58.109
think that you're lawyers.

446
00:19:58.153 --> 00:19:59.198
You're not!

447
00:19:59.241 --> 00:20:00.286
You're doctors!

448
00:20:00.329 --> 00:20:02.026
Really bad doctors

449
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.941
who should have had
really good lawyers!

450
00:20:03.985 --> 00:20:05.856
- You're not gonna find
us guilty. are you?

451
00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.206
- Oh you [beep] right I'm
gonna find you guilty.

452
00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:09.338
- Judge. you can't!

453
00:20:09.382 --> 00:20:10.687
I saved your son's life.

454
00:20:10.731 --> 00:20:11.906
- You're a doctor.

455
00:20:11.949 --> 00:20:12.820
That's what you're
supposed to do. doctor.

456
00:20:12.863 --> 00:20:15.301
- Wait. wait. hold on Sherman.

457
00:20:15.344 --> 00:20:17.041
You worked on the judge's son?

458
00:20:17.085 --> 00:20:19.261
- Yes. first I shot his son.

459
00:20:19.305 --> 00:20:21.568
then I saved his life.
yadda. yadda. yadda.

460
00:20:21.611 --> 00:20:24.048
- Judge. I demand
that you tell us

461
00:20:24.092 --> 00:20:25.789
what happened with the shootin'.

462
00:20:25.833 --> 00:20:28.836
- Dynomite. you
goof ball. [laughs]

463
00:20:28.879 --> 00:20:30.620
Ain't no good times for
him. though no more huh?

464
00:20:30.664 --> 00:20:32.361
[both laughing]

465
00:20:32.405 --> 00:20:35.625
[gasps] Now. watch
this masterpiece unfold

466
00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:39.194
with a crescendo by
none other than moi.

467
00:20:41.979 --> 00:20:43.764
- You speak French?

468
00:20:43.807 --> 00:20:44.634
- Si.

469
00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:46.810
[Kitty sighs]

470
00:20:46.854 --> 00:20:48.377
[transition sound effect]

471
00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:49.639
- To Dr. Rinard's credit.
it was an accident.

472
00:20:49.683 --> 00:20:51.728
- And pretty funny
story. [laughing]

473
00:20:51.772 --> 00:20:53.991
I gotta tell ya-
- You shooting my son

474
00:20:54.035 --> 00:20:55.645
is not relevant to this case.

475
00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:57.081
nor is the fact that
you saved his life.

476
00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:58.431
I'll tell you what is relevant.

477
00:20:58.474 --> 00:21:00.476
what you [beep] did
to this hospital!

478
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.044
- Well. oops. there it
is. we got a mistrial.

479
00:21:03.087 --> 00:21:04.915
[laughing]

480
00:21:04.959 --> 00:21:06.874
- Yeah. and. you know. this
trial didn't go correctly

481
00:21:06.917 --> 00:21:08.223
'cause I didn't do it.

482
00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.051
- I didn't do it either.

483
00:21:10.094 --> 00:21:11.444
- I definitely did it.

484
00:21:11.487 --> 00:21:13.968
but I loved it and
I would do it again!

485
00:21:14.011 --> 00:21:15.709
- You son of a [beep].
[group shouting]

486
00:21:15.752 --> 00:21:17.450
- This is the guilty
guy. right here!

487
00:21:17.493 --> 00:21:18.973
- And you have been pitchin' him

488
00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:22.237
on a drug-induced
coma for months now.

489
00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.761
- And I keep telling you. I'm
completely fine with that.

490
00:21:24.805 --> 00:21:25.675
[gavel bangs]

491
00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:27.982
- No mistrial. no comas.

492
00:21:28.025 --> 00:21:30.419
That would be too easy for
you pack of jack [beep].

493
00:21:30.463 --> 00:21:33.379
You are so lucky I don't
have the right to [beep] you.

494
00:21:33.422 --> 00:21:35.424
- Your honor. now I've
been researchin' that.

495
00:21:35.468 --> 00:21:36.556
and I think I've
found a loophole

496
00:21:36.599 --> 00:21:38.209
that you may be happy to hear.

497
00:21:38.253 --> 00:21:41.517
- Judge. you have to legally
declare a mistrial here.

498
00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:44.520
I shot your son even
if it was by accident.

499
00:21:44.564 --> 00:21:46.870
- Oh wait. wait. judge.
judge. your honor. your honor.

500
00:21:46.914 --> 00:21:48.524
I would actually like to
hear about that shooting.

501
00:21:48.568 --> 00:21:50.091
It actually sounds
kind of funny.

502
00:21:50.134 --> 00:21:51.701
- Actually it is a little funny.

503
00:21:51.745 --> 00:21:54.530
You see. the judge's son.
he's a little strange.

504
00:21:54.574 --> 00:21:55.575
- I didn't wanna say anything.

505
00:21:55.618 --> 00:21:57.403
- What?
[whip cracks]

506
00:21:57.446 --> 00:21:59.056
[gavel bangs]
[transition sound effect]

507
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.319
- And I will see to it
that more corrupt doctors

508
00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:02.233
join you here as prisoners.

509
00:22:02.277 --> 00:22:05.411
Together you all are going to

510
00:22:05.454 --> 00:22:07.630
restore this beautiful hospital

511
00:22:07.674 --> 00:22:11.286
to the once divine
institution that it was.

512
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.767
[gavel bangs]

513
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.118
- Yeah. I'm sorry guys. I'm
gonna have to with [beep].

514
00:22:17.161 --> 00:22:20.426
- [Chuck] Bingo. we
have a winner. Kitty.

515
00:22:20.469 --> 00:22:22.732
but what were all
the stupid beeps for?

516
00:22:24.517 --> 00:22:28.738
- [sighs] Why couldn't
we call from home. Chuck?

517
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.176
I just want to play.

518
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.744
- So they can't trace the
phone call Mrs. Einstein.

519
00:22:36.442 --> 00:22:37.530
- Who's Mrs. Einstein?

520
00:22:38.792 --> 00:22:40.097
Chuck are you cheatin' on me?

521
00:22:41.621 --> 00:22:43.405
- We were misused in that movie.

522
00:22:43.449 --> 00:22:47.975
- Yeah. but we got a lot
of free food. [giggles]

523
00:22:48.018 --> 00:22:50.499
- Our blinding talent

00:29:22.369 --> 00:29:23.892
- Because he always
wanted to do an accent.

700
00:29:23.936 --> 00:29:26.025
but they were so terrible
Dad wouldn't let him.

701
00:29:26.068 --> 00:29:27.722
It got Chuck really mad.

702
00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:28.854
- [Chuck] You don't put
somebody as powerful

703
00:29:28.897 --> 00:29:30.899
as Prince Charles on hold.

704
00:29:30.943 --> 00:29:32.422
I'm back Prince Charles.

705
00:29:32.466 --> 00:29:36.122
I moved up to King and I
want to set off the drop off.

706
00:29:36.165 --> 00:29:38.298
the where and when of it all.
- Yes. yes. of course.

707
00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:40.300
the where and when pf
it all. I'm listening.

708
00:29:40.343 --> 00:29:41.780
[cellphone clicking]

709
00:29:41.823 --> 00:29:43.303
- We have their address.
we know it. right?

710
00:29:43.346 --> 00:29:44.608
- I've got their address.

711
00:29:44.652 --> 00:29:45.827
- [Chuck] There's a
very special dumpster

712
00:29:45.871 --> 00:29:48.177
that I want you to
deposit the million in.

713
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:51.528
I suppose you want to know
where this dumpster is.

714
00:29:51.572 --> 00:29:53.617
- Mom. take it off mute.
- Hello?

715
00:29:53.661 --> 00:29:56.185
- Uh yes.
- Are you listening to me?

716
00:29:56.229 --> 00:29:58.753
Take this information
down my love.

717
00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:02.017
and we expect you to
adhere to it to a T.

718
00:30:03.976 --> 00:30:08.197
- Tell her we want
it in dollars. not.
uh. what's it called?

719
00:30:08.241 --> 00:30:09.198
- Pounds.
- Pounds.

720
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.421
[jazzy holiday music]

721
00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:28.130
- Chuck. Kitty. these guys!

722
00:30:28.174 --> 00:30:29.349
- Hello Mark.
- Hi Mark.

723
00:30:29.392 --> 00:30:31.438
- Hi. thank you. [laughs]
[Mark laughing]

724
00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:35.703
- Hi. boy. do we got a
Christmas present for you.

725
00:30:35.746 --> 00:30:37.923
- Well. I celebrate
Valentine's Day at Christmas.

726
00:30:37.966 --> 00:30:39.185
but you've sparked my interest.

727
00:30:39.228 --> 00:30:40.142
[cellphone ringing]
- Good. good.

728
00:30:40.186 --> 00:30:41.578
- Uh. one second. one sec.

729
00:30:43.406 --> 00:30:46.322
- Keen entertainment. how may
I direct your call. [grunts]

730
00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:48.542
I'm sorry Mr. Keen
is in a meeting.

731
00:30:48.585 --> 00:30:49.848
May I give him a message?

732
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:54.635
I see. well. let me connect
you with one of his partners.

733
00:30:54.678 --> 00:30:55.679
Please hold.

734
00:30:55.723 --> 00:30:58.552
[jazzy holiday music]

735
00:31:00.206 --> 00:31:01.033
- What if they're not home?

736
00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:02.686
- Then we wait.

737
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.037
- Wait. they specifically
said to take the money

738
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.255
and put it in a dumpster.

739
00:31:06.299 --> 00:31:07.561
Isn't that what they said?

740
00:31:07.604 --> 00:31:08.692
Take the money. put
it in a dumpster

741
00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:10.694
in that office
building in Hackensack.

742
00:31:10.738 --> 00:31:12.914
- So what. who cares
what they said?

743
00:31:12.958 --> 00:31:15.047
We can ambush him here.

744
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.092
- Maybe it's not
a good idea sis.

745
00:31:17.136 --> 00:31:18.877
If you'd let me handle this...

746
00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.009
- Ronald. we are
going to do this.

747
00:31:21.053 --> 00:31:22.184
We are getting this movie back

748
00:31:22.228 --> 00:31:24.056
because we promised Kace.

749
00:31:24.099 --> 00:31:24.926
- Okay.

750
00:31:26.362 --> 00:31:28.408
Then we'll follow
the instructions.

751
00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:31.193
- Don't deposit the
check until next Monday.

752
00:31:31.237 --> 00:31:33.108
Everything should be okay.

753
00:31:34.631 --> 00:31:38.287
Good. good. I'm glad we
could work this out. bubala.

754
00:31:38.331 --> 00:31:40.942
We'll do brunch and talk
future goods and chattels.

755
00:31:40.986 --> 00:31:41.987
Chao baby!

756
00:31:43.336 --> 00:31:44.163
Shall we?

757
00:31:45.338 --> 00:31:46.992
- You're really
good with accents.

758
00:31:47.035 --> 00:31:48.819
- Gracias.

759
00:31:48.863 --> 00:31:50.473
- That is really good Mexican.

760
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.476
[Ronald knocking]

761
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.913
- Nobody home. should
I leave a note?

762
00:31:54.956 --> 00:31:56.218
- Leave a note!

763
00:31:57.567 --> 00:32:01.049
- Welcome to St. Clair's
Correctional Institute.

764
00:32:02.485 --> 00:32:06.881
Day one of your sentence
is officially over.

765
00:32:07.751 --> 00:32:08.578
See ya!

766
00:32:11.538 --> 00:32:15.368
- Oh thank God. I just
need to go to bed.

767
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.374
[splattering]
[crashing]

768
00:32:21.417 --> 00:32:24.377
- Nurse had to be my
most delicate scalpel.

769
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:29.730
- Doctor. what in God's
name are you doing?

770
00:32:29.773 --> 00:32:30.861
- Surgery!

771
00:32:30.905 --> 00:32:32.515
[grunts]
[crashes]

772
00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:35.344
- Hey. hey. hey. this is my
room now. you can't do this.

773
00:32:35.388 --> 00:32:37.694
You have to leave.

774
00:32:37.738 --> 00:32:41.002
- Well. then I'll leave
you alone. but first

775
00:32:41.046 --> 00:32:45.267
we have to help this woman.
she's about to give birth.

776
00:32:45.311 --> 00:32:48.749
And as our newest addition.
you should do the honors.

777
00:32:48.792 --> 00:32:53.580
[Dr. Stone sighs]
[rock music]

778
00:32:53.623 --> 00:32:55.799
- Okay. [beep] it.

779
00:32:55.843 --> 00:32:57.671
[grunting]
[screaming]

780
00:32:57.714 --> 00:33:02.589
Done. yes. yes. yes!
[groaning]

781
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:08.203
[Chuck sighs]

782
00:33:08.247 --> 00:33:09.378
- It's magnificent.
[Chuck sighs]

783
00:33:09.422 --> 00:33:10.292
[Chuck laughing]
- And you're saying

784
00:33:10.336 --> 00:33:11.380
an 11-year-old directed it?

785
00:33:11.424 --> 00:33:12.555
- Yes. yes. yes. yes.

786
00:33:12.599 --> 00:33:14.035
but we're the producers
and we own it.

787
00:33:14.079 --> 00:33:16.298
- That's right. we own it.

788
00:33:16.342 --> 00:33:18.605
and we have the right copy.

789
00:33:20.215 --> 00:33:21.521
- She means copyright.

790
00:33:21.564 --> 00:33:23.218
- It's incredible.
[Chuck groans]

791
00:33:23.262 --> 00:33:24.872
I'll have to have
my partner see it.

792
00:33:24.915 --> 00:33:26.787
[Chucks sighs and laughs]
- Do you think his partners

793
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.093
are gonna love it?

794
00:33:28.136 --> 00:33:31.096
- Oh. I would love
to take a look at it!

795
00:33:31.139 --> 00:33:32.575
[Chuck groans]

796
00:33:32.619 --> 00:33:35.665
You have an eye for
talent. Mark Keen.

797
00:33:35.709 --> 00:33:38.755
My partner. Shmuel
Kleinfelder. is interested.

798
00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:40.409
[chuck sighs]

799
00:33:40.453 --> 00:33:42.803
I'm gonna have Gloria set
up another screening day.

800
00:33:42.846 --> 00:33:44.761
Yes Mr. Keen. you
and Mr. Kleinfelder

801
00:33:44.805 --> 00:33:48.113
are both available
this Thursday at noon.

802
00:33:48.156 --> 00:33:50.680
That's Christmas Day.
I'll be hunting antelope

803
00:33:50.724 --> 00:33:53.118
with my girlfriend and
her sister. Louise.

804
00:33:53.161 --> 00:33:55.076
It's our St. Valentine's ritual.

805
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.559
I'm sorry Mr. Keen. I will
definitely find another date.

806
00:33:59.602 --> 00:34:01.300
My people will
contact your people.

807
00:34:01.343 --> 00:34:02.388
- Oh thank you.
- And we will

808
00:34:02.431 --> 00:34:04.433
definitely work this out.

809
00:34:04.477 --> 00:34:07.088
- Thank you. [laughs]
- Oh. I loved it.

810
00:34:07.132 --> 00:34:09.090
but all these annoying
beeps made me think

811
00:34:09.134 --> 00:34:10.570
my pacemaker was going off.

812
00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:14.139
- Can we go home now?

813
00:34:14.182 --> 00:34:17.142
I really want to play
chutes and ladders.

814
00:34:17.185 --> 00:34:19.796
[Kitty giggling]

815
00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.059
- Let's go.

816
00:34:21.102 --> 00:34:22.843
- We're gonna be rich.
- Oh. yes we are.

817
00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:26.629
- [Radio Host] I say you
have to work for your money.

818
00:34:26.673 --> 00:34:29.850
Right form birth. no
handouts. no freebies.

819
00:34:29.893 --> 00:34:33.114
form day one. why
can't Americans do it?

820
00:34:33.158 --> 00:34:35.986
They do it in other countries.
the animal kingdom does it.

821
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:38.119
fish. bumblebees.
they all start working

822
00:34:38.163 --> 00:34:39.686
right after they're born.

823
00:34:39.729 --> 00:34:41.688
Queen bees don't
pamper their babies

824
00:34:41.731 --> 00:34:45.126
with bottles and
rattles. no ma'am.

825
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:48.912
They gotta start making honey
right when they're hatched.

826
00:34:48.956 --> 00:34:53.656
Wait. the Congo government
has just been overthrown.

827
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.919
and an American Olympic wrestler

828
00:34:55.963 --> 00:34:58.705
apparently is at
the center of it.

829
00:34:58.748 --> 00:35:01.447
Ajax Gabriel is headlining
a wrestling tournament

830
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:04.667
dubbed the Christmas
coup in the Congo.

831
00:35:04.711 --> 00:35:07.105
which has turned
into a real coup.

832
00:35:07.148 --> 00:35:08.802
After pinning several
jungle beasts.

833
00:35:08.845 --> 00:35:11.413
and a few of the
Congo's best wrestlers.

834
00:35:11.457 --> 00:35:13.328
the country's
dictator. Bob Smith.

835
00:35:13.372 --> 00:35:15.896
challenged Gabriel
to a wrestling match.

836
00:35:15.939 --> 00:35:18.942
Smith. most don't realize.
illegally immigrated

837
00:35:18.986 --> 00:35:22.163
to the Congo with
1995 from Norway.

838
00:35:22.207 --> 00:35:24.948
Known to be on steroids.
Smith has also been

839
00:35:24.992 --> 00:35:28.648
the Congo's bodybuilding
champion since he forcibly

840
00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:31.390
took control of
the nation in 2010.

841
00:35:31.433 --> 00:35:34.523
Well. now he is locked in a cage

842
00:35:34.567 --> 00:35:37.309
at the Congo's premier
sports stadium.

843
00:35:37.352 --> 00:35:38.527
We've got play by play

844
00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:41.748
from South African
sports network. BBD.

845
00:35:41.791 --> 00:35:44.838
live. when this all
went down moments ago.

846
00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:48.189
[suspenseful music]

847
00:35:48.233 --> 00:35:49.364
- [George] What's this?

848
00:35:49.408 --> 00:35:51.366
President Smith is
beckoning Ajax Gabriel.

849
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.716
I thought he was
congratulating him. but no.

850
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.370
He's taunting the American.

851
00:35:55.414 --> 00:35:57.981
The president is waving a
tiger's tooth at Gabriel.

852
00:35:58.025 --> 00:36:00.462
That's Congo for "let's fight!"

853
00:36:00.506 --> 00:36:02.377
Well a fight. it's going to be.

854
00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:04.510
President Smith has
ripped off his shirt.

855
00:36:04.553 --> 00:36:07.991
He is one muscular man. almost
six feet five inches tall

856
00:36:08.035 --> 00:36:11.647
and weighing 255 pounds.

857
00:36:11.691 --> 00:36:13.736
Gabriel doesn't seem phased.

858
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.130
Well. he did just pin three
Congo national champs.

859
00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:18.785
and it was rather spectacular
what he did to that giraffe.

860
00:36:18.828 --> 00:36:21.135
Here comes Smith onto the mat.

861
00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.136
I don't know what to expect.

862
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.529
He's a frugal man.

863
00:36:23.572 --> 00:36:26.009
My God. Gabriel has immediately

864
00:36:26.053 --> 00:36:28.534
hit the president
with a flying cradle!

865
00:36:28.577 --> 00:36:31.667
President Smith has been
pinned it's three seconds!

866
00:36:31.711 --> 00:36:33.582
It's bedlam here.

867
00:36:33.626 --> 00:36:35.497
Military personnel
are rushing the mat.

868
00:36:35.541 --> 00:36:37.282
The American may
have some trouble.

869
00:36:37.325 --> 00:36:40.546
Gabriel is tossing Smith
to the Congo soldiers.

870
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:42.983
They might harass the American.

871
00:36:43.026 --> 00:36:45.377
I don't understand. the
soldiers are handcuffing Smith.

872
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.030
who violently fighting them.

873
00:36:47.074 --> 00:36:49.381
A whole militia has suddenly
appeared in the stadium.

874
00:36:49.424 --> 00:36:51.165
Guns are pointed everywhere.

875
00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:52.601
Oh. I'm out of here.

876
00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:54.603
The giraffe and
rhino were one thing.

877
00:36:54.647 --> 00:36:57.127
but this. this is a
real military coup!

878
00:36:57.171 --> 00:36:58.172
[radio feeds back]

879
00:36:58.216 --> 00:37:00.218
Lancaster. you wimp.

880
00:37:00.261 --> 00:37:02.263
- [Lancaster] I
already won and Emmy.

881
00:37:02.307 --> 00:37:05.484
- Eh. British Sportscasters
don't win Emmy's.

882
00:37:05.527 --> 00:37:07.355
You're-
- This is George Scott

883
00:37:07.399 --> 00:37:09.792
reporting live from the Congo.

884
00:37:09.836 --> 00:37:11.925
President Bob Smith
is now being rushed

885
00:37:11.968 --> 00:37:14.667
into an octagon mixed
martial arts cage

886
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.757
that abuts the wrestling mat
where he was just pinned-

887
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.411
- Oy vey.
- By American Olympic champ.

888
00:37:19.454 --> 00:37:21.717
Ajax Gabriel.

889
00:37:21.761 --> 00:37:24.981
Gabriel is following the
soldiers to the cage.

890
00:37:25.025 --> 00:37:28.158
He has just been joined by
general General Gildas Ringo.

891
00:37:28.202 --> 00:37:30.204
Oh. wow!

892
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:33.686
The generalist throwing a
bucket of tomato sauce on Smith.

893
00:37:33.729 --> 00:37:36.906
That's the ultimate sign
of disrespect in the Congo.

894
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.169
The president is locked
in the octagon cage

895
00:37:39.213 --> 00:37:40.823
covered in gravy.

896
00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:42.869
Gabriel is high
fiving the general.

897
00:37:42.912 --> 00:37:43.783
It appears-

898
00:37:43.826 --> 00:37:45.785
[static interrupts broadcast]

899
00:37:45.828 --> 00:37:47.352
- [Radio Host] No.
American Olympian.

900
00:37:47.395 --> 00:37:51.051
Ajax Gabriel. has assisted.
maybe brainstormed

901
00:37:51.094 --> 00:37:54.097
the overthrow of a
foreign dictator.

902
00:37:54.141 --> 00:37:55.795
It's dark in the Congo now

903
00:37:55.838 --> 00:37:59.755
after BBD sports caster.
George Scott. cut out.

904
00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:01.496
No media has been able to report

905
00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.193
from the former
communist country.

906
00:38:03.237 --> 00:38:07.981
All TV. radio. and internet
access has been shut down.

907
00:38:08.895 --> 00:38:11.898
- Ajax. Agent Truman.

908
00:38:11.941 --> 00:38:13.682
Is that who you really are?

909
00:38:13.726 --> 00:38:16.685
[light holiday music]

910
00:38:18.774 --> 00:38:21.037
- Cassandra. do you got
that guy in the cage.

911
00:38:21.081 --> 00:38:22.430
or do we gotta go to the bank?

912
00:38:22.474 --> 00:38:24.867
- No. not without Ajax.

913
00:38:24.911 --> 00:38:26.739
- Nah. he's never
gonna make it on time.

914
00:38:26.782 --> 00:38:29.132
- Shh. Kace could hear you.
he's in the other room.

915
00:38:29.176 --> 00:38:31.918
- Eh. he's got his
headsets on. he's fine.

916
00:38:31.961 --> 00:38:33.267
You know. you're really
short change this kid.

917
00:38:33.311 --> 00:38:34.399
He's really bright.

918
00:38:34.442 --> 00:38:35.443
He knows what's goin' on.

919
00:38:35.487 --> 00:38:37.097
He knows how important this is.

920
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:39.534
He knows the scenario
that's happening.

921
00:38:39.578 --> 00:38:41.144
- Well. these thieves don't know

922
00:38:41.188 --> 00:38:42.624
how important this
film is to us.

923
00:38:42.668 --> 00:38:44.365
Maybe we couldn't negotiate.

924
00:38:44.409 --> 00:38:46.367
- I disagree with you.

925
00:38:46.411 --> 00:38:47.934
They were on the set.

926
00:38:47.977 --> 00:38:49.936
They know exactly how
important this was the Kace.

927
00:38:51.546 --> 00:38:52.547
- What would Ajax do?

928
00:38:53.722 --> 00:38:54.810
- Well. if he gets here

929
00:38:54.854 --> 00:38:55.594
on time. we'll find out.
[doorbell rings]

930
00:38:55.637 --> 00:38:56.856
- [groans] Not now.

931
00:38:56.899 --> 00:38:58.161
- Yeah. maybe it's him.

932
00:38:58.205 --> 00:38:59.075
Maybe he got your text.

933
00:38:59.119 --> 00:39:00.076
- He's not gonna ring the bell.

934
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.123
[door bell ringing]

935
00:39:03.166 --> 00:39:04.907
[door creaks]

936
00:39:04.951 --> 00:39:07.736
- Cassandra. what was
your reaction when
you heard the news?

937
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.955
- It was on the news?

938
00:39:08.998 --> 00:39:10.391
Did you see it on the news?

939
00:39:10.435 --> 00:39:12.175
[heels clicking]

940
00:39:12.219 --> 00:39:13.786
- Nope.

941
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:15.178
- You know. to tell you
the truth. we're not gonna

942
00:39:15.222 --> 00:39:16.789
let it ruin our Christmas
one way or the other.

943
00:39:16.832 --> 00:39:18.791
- How could it not.
what about Kace?

944
00:39:18.834 --> 00:39:20.532
- Kace is cool with it.
and Kace is cool with it.

945
00:39:20.575 --> 00:39:22.403
then we all are.

946
00:39:22.447 --> 00:39:26.451
- I see. by the way. have you
been able to talk to Ajax?

947
00:39:26.494 --> 00:39:28.844
- You know. my brother
Ronald is here.

948
00:39:28.888 --> 00:39:31.325
and he's not gonna
replace Ajax. of course.

949
00:39:31.369 --> 00:39:32.935
but he'll do until
my husband gets home.

950
00:39:32.979 --> 00:39:34.067
- If he gets home.

951
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:35.503
- You know what?

952
00:39:35.547 --> 00:39:37.200
Ajax has been in skirmishes
like this before.

953
00:39:37.244 --> 00:39:39.986
and he always ends up on top.
even with an animal like that.

954
00:39:41.248 --> 00:39:42.597
- Am I hearing this right?

955
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:44.947
Cassandra is referring
to president Bob Smith

956
00:39:44.991 --> 00:39:47.080
as a quote unquote. big animal.

957
00:39:47.123 --> 00:39:49.430
- That guy is jacked.

958
00:39:49.474 --> 00:39:52.390
- Communist dictator or not.
he is still a human being.

959
00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:53.695
- What are you talking about?

960
00:39:55.175 --> 00:39:56.916
You're not talking
about the movie.

961
00:39:56.959 --> 00:39:58.831
- No. I'm not talking
about the movie.

962
00:39:58.874 --> 00:40:01.355
I am a journalist before
I'm an actress. okay?

963
00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:03.052
Listen. Ajax is your husband.

964
00:40:03.096 --> 00:40:04.358
you don't seem to at least
be concerned about him.

965
00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:05.577
- You know what. Kelly?

966
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.143
I don't have time for this.

967
00:40:07.187 --> 00:40:08.797
Ajax wrestling and
elephant on Christmas Eve

968
00:40:08.841 --> 00:40:10.538
is the least of my concerns.

969
00:40:12.018 --> 00:40:13.846
- Wait a minute. what?

970
00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:16.544
- Cassandra. you have to
see what's on the news.

971
00:40:18.328 --> 00:40:20.853
- [Ronald] [grunts] Oh. so
you're a tough guy. huh?

972
00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:22.289
- [Kace] Yeah. I'm
tough like my dad.

973
00:40:22.332 --> 00:40:24.509
- [Ronald] Whoa. whoa. whoa.
hey. hey. big guy. hey.

974
00:40:24.552 --> 00:40:25.945
you're Dad's gonna be
all right. don't worry.

975
00:40:25.988 --> 00:40:27.250
- I know he is.

976
00:40:27.294 --> 00:40:28.208
- [Ronald] How do you know?

977
00:40:28.251 --> 00:40:30.515
- 'Cause I watch the news.

978
00:40:30.558 --> 00:40:32.255
- You know. I gotta
start doin' that.

979
00:40:32.299 --> 00:40:33.866
- Yeah. Dad's with General Ringo

980
00:40:33.909 --> 00:40:37.173
who arranged for him to hold
the Christmas coup in Congo.

981
00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:39.828
- Actually. it might be
the other way around.

982
00:40:39.872 --> 00:40:41.482
- Huh?

983
00:40:41.526 --> 00:40:43.223
- I just got off the phone with
the US Ambassador to Congo.

984
00:40:43.266 --> 00:40:45.791
and it seems that he fled
the country on an alpaca.

985
00:40:45.834 --> 00:40:48.184
[Kace chuckles]
But Daddy is okay.

986
00:40:48.228 --> 00:40:50.230
He's staying with the general.

987
00:40:50.273 --> 00:40:53.102
but he's still scheduled
to wrestle tomorrow night.

988
00:40:53.146 --> 00:40:55.409
But I can't get through
to anyone in the Congo.

989
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:57.846
all the communication
lines are down.

990
00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.414
I think that Ajax
is in the Congo

991
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:01.807
for more than pinning
Barnabas the Elephant.

992
00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:03.461
[gentle music]

993
00:41:03.504 --> 00:41:04.853
[chuck grunting]

994
00:41:04.897 --> 00:41:06.899
- What do I say if
someone comes along?

995
00:41:06.942 --> 00:41:08.596
- It's not in here.
- Hey. is that another accent?

996
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.294
- [grunts] The
money's not in here.

997
00:41:11.338 --> 00:41:12.295
Let's get to the car.

998
00:41:12.339 --> 00:41:13.514
- Where we goin'?

999
00:41:13.558 --> 00:41:14.907
- Well. not to Mexico.
not yet anyway.

1000
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.170
- How 'bout to Paris
'cause I always wanted

1001
00:41:17.213 --> 00:41:18.476
to see the pyramids.

1002
00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:19.999
- The pyramids aren't in Paris.

1003
00:41:20.042 --> 00:41:21.522
they're in that country
with. I don't know. King Tut.

1004
00:41:21.566 --> 00:41:22.392
- Huh?

1005
00:41:22.436 --> 00:41:24.133
- Cleopatra.

1006
00:41:24.177 --> 00:41:27.572
- Oh. that's right. Egypt.
where they got the Grand Canyon!

1007
00:41:27.615 --> 00:41:31.097
- [laughs] It's time to
play tag. and they're it.

1008
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.578

1010
00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:39.235
- Open up in there!

1011
00:41:39.279 --> 00:41:41.629
- Yeah. open the doh.
we ain't foolin' around.

1012
00:41:41.673 --> 00:41:43.501
[cellphone vibrates]

1013
00:41:43.544 --> 00:41:44.937
- [gasps] It's him.

1014
00:41:46.765 --> 00:41:49.115
Hello Mr. German or Mr. English.

1015
00:41:49.158 --> 00:41:50.420
whoever the heck you are today.

1016
00:41:50.464 --> 00:41:53.554
- You think you're so smart.

1017
00:41:53.598 --> 00:41:56.078
I give you specific directions

1018
00:41:56.122 --> 00:42:00.126
to specific dumpster
at specific time.

1019
00:42:00.169 --> 00:42:03.956
- Yes. well we had some
interceding issues.

1020
00:42:03.999 --> 00:42:07.481
- [Chuck] Like your husband.
wrestling dictators.

1021
00:42:07.525 --> 00:42:11.485
- Listen! Ajax will tear you
apart and then I will. okay?

1022
00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:12.573
I know who you are.

1023
00:42:12.617 --> 00:42:14.706
- Cassandra. calm down.

1024
00:42:14.749 --> 00:42:16.577
- [Chuck] I know you know.

1025
00:42:16.621 --> 00:42:18.492
- How do you know I know?

1026
00:42:18.536 --> 00:42:20.712
- We all want
Charlie to wake up.

1027
00:42:20.755 --> 00:42:22.322
don't we Cassandra Gabriel?

1028
00:42:24.106 --> 00:42:25.760
Listen closely.

1029
00:42:25.804 --> 00:42:30.330
There is an office at 866
Prescott Street. Suite C.

1030
00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.681
- Well. how do I know
which one is Suite C?

1031
00:42:33.725 --> 00:42:35.553
- [Chuck] Because
it's marked suite C.

1032
00:42:35.596 --> 00:42:36.597
- On the door?

1033
00:42:36.641 --> 00:42:37.555
- No. on the roof.

1034
00:42:37.598 --> 00:42:39.339
Yes. on the door.

1035
00:42:39.382 --> 00:42:41.210
- Suite C?

1036
00:42:41.254 --> 00:42:45.780
- [sighs] Be there in exactly
23 minutes with the money.

1037
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.958
The front door to the
office will be open.

1038
00:42:50.002 --> 00:42:53.353
Open the door and
put the bag of cash

1039
00:42:53.396 --> 00:42:56.138
immediately to the right.

1040
00:42:56.182 --> 00:42:58.793
Don't bring that doofus
who's with you now.

1041
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:01.666
- Does he want to talk to me?

1042
00:43:01.709 --> 00:43:03.668

- Ajax can you hear me?

1213
00:50:35.684 --> 00:50:36.946
I can't really hear you.

1214
00:50:38.252 --> 00:50:40.776
Ajax. can you hear me?

1215
00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.430
I'm here.

1216
00:50:42.474 --> 00:50:43.562
Ajax.

1217
00:50:44.563 --> 00:50:47.783
- Cassandra.
- Oh. Ajax. I.

1218
00:50:47.827 --> 00:50:50.351
I really need you here.

1219
00:50:50.395 --> 00:50:51.744
I need my partner.

1220
00:50:53.528 --> 00:50:57.837
It's Kace. he's okay. but that
idiot Wiener from the movie.

1221
00:50:58.794 --> 00:50:59.621
he played Dr. McShea.

1222
00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:05.366
And my stupid Ronald. he
didn't make copies of the film.

1223
00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:07.803
and now Wiener and
his girlfriend.

1224
00:51:07.847 --> 00:51:09.762
they. they. they took the movie

1225
00:51:09.805 --> 00:51:12.069
and they want a million
dollars to give it back.

1226
00:51:13.766 --> 00:51:16.856
Ajax. I took the money from
your protein shake commercials.

1227
00:51:16.899 --> 00:51:18.510
and your sports gambling.

1228
00:51:19.337 --> 00:51:20.120
[bangs]

1229
00:51:20.164 --> 00:51:22.427
Ajax. are you okay?

1230
00:51:23.384 --> 00:51:25.865
Ajax?
[elephant trumpets]

1231
00:51:25.908 --> 00:51:30.652
[groans] And Kace.
he's so confident

1232
00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:34.656
that everything's gonna
turn out well with Charlie.

1233
00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:38.138
and. and this miracle
he's been talking about.

1234
00:51:38.182 --> 00:51:39.705
it's gonna happen.

1235
00:51:39.748 --> 00:51:41.881
And that Charlie's
gonna hear this movie.

1236
00:51:41.924 --> 00:51:45.276
and he's gonna laugh
and he's gonna wake up.

1237
00:51:45.319 --> 00:51:48.061
Kace has so much faith.

1238
00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:52.326
So it just comes down to
tonight. Christmas Eve and

1239
00:51:53.849 --> 00:51:56.504
they want to meet us at
our very special place.

1240
00:51:56.548 --> 00:52:00.117
[explosion blasts]
[guns firing]

1241
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.729
Ajax. are you
still there. hello?

1242
00:52:06.688 --> 00:52:10.518
[guns firing]
[elephants trumpeting angrily]

1243
00:52:10.562 --> 00:52:15.262
[Kitty Kat imitating gun fire]

1244
00:52:15.306 --> 00:52:17.525
- You know. that was
really nice of your brother

1245
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:19.832
to close the restaurant
on Christmas Eve.

1246
00:52:22.008 --> 00:52:24.445
You know. it's just
kind of spiritual.

1247
00:52:24.489 --> 00:52:27.318
- Like they do in
Afghanistan on Christmas.

1248
00:52:27.361 --> 00:52:31.235
- Yeah. and it was awful nice
of him to let us sleep here

1249
00:52:31.278 --> 00:52:33.715
after dinner last night.

1250
00:52:33.759 --> 00:52:36.327
'Cept the food was kind of icky.

1251
00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:39.939
That was not very good
Chinese food at all.

1252
00:52:39.982 --> 00:52:41.158
- That's because it's Ital.

1253
00:52:42.594 --> 00:52:44.161
We're German!

1254
00:52:44.204 --> 00:52:47.468
[funky holiday music]

1255
00:53:09.403 --> 00:53:10.970
- Ready?

1256
00:53:11.013 --> 00:53:13.146
- Ah. I was born ready.

1257
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:14.800
- Let's do this.

1258
00:53:14.843 --> 00:53:19.587
["Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky]

1259
00:53:22.416 --> 00:53:23.591
- Are you ready?

1260
00:53:25.071 --> 00:53:27.291
- Ms. Kitty Kat.
I was born ready.

1261
00:53:27.334 --> 00:53:30.772
[both laughing]

1262
00:53:30.816 --> 00:53:33.166
[Kitty purrs]

1263
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:35.777
[both laughing]

1264
00:53:36.604 --> 00:53:37.431
- [Kitty] Oo. oh!

1265
00:53:39.955 --> 00:53:42.306
[funky music]

1266
00:53:46.048 --> 00:53:48.268
- When I spelled the word bear.

1267
00:53:48.312 --> 00:53:51.663
you throw the million
dollar money back.

1268
00:53:51.706 --> 00:53:54.143
we throw the box
with the hard drive.

1269
00:53:54.187 --> 00:53:56.189
- Well. why can't you
just count to five?

1270
00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:59.845
- Or say. "A. B. C. D. E."

1271
00:53:59.888 --> 00:54:01.542
- Yeah. that would be easier.

1272
00:54:01.586 --> 00:54:04.415
- Oh my God. shut up everyone.

1273
00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:07.244
It's when I spell the word bear.

1274
00:54:07.287 --> 00:54:09.071
- Hold on.

1275
00:54:09.115 --> 00:54:12.074
When she throws the hard
drive. isn't it gonna break?

1276
00:54:12.118 --> 00:54:14.468
- Duh. we wrapped it
all up in bubble wrap.

1277
00:54:14.512 --> 00:54:16.644
and we're throwin' it
on a wrestlin' mat.

1278
00:54:16.688 --> 00:54:20.648
- Now. I'm spelling
the word bear.

1279
00:54:20.692 --> 00:54:22.868
Get ready to throw the bag.

1280
00:54:22.911 --> 00:54:27.612
B-E-A-R.

1281
00:54:27.655 --> 00:54:30.571
- Wait a minute. that's
not how you spell bare.

1282
00:54:30.615 --> 00:54:34.488
Bare is B-A-R-E.

1283
00:54:34.532 --> 00:54:35.881
- It's not bare in the cupboard.

1284
00:54:35.924 --> 00:54:38.492
This is bear in
the woods. [growls]

1285
00:54:38.536 --> 00:54:40.015
- How am I supposed
to know that?

1286
00:54:40.059 --> 00:54:41.626
- It's just bear.

1287
00:54:41.669 --> 00:54:45.107
- But bare in the cupboards.
or like bear in the woods?

1288
00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:49.068
- Okay. fine. bare in
the cupboard. B-A-R-E!

1289
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:50.765
- That is bare in the cupboard.

1290
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:52.071
- [Chuck] Throw the bag.

1291
00:54:55.161 --> 00:54:59.731

[zipper zips]

1293
00:55:03.343 --> 00:55:04.170
- Oowee!

1294
00:55:05.911 --> 00:55:08.696
That's looks like a
billion bucks to me. baby.

1295
00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:11.612
- What is this?

1296
00:55:11.656 --> 00:55:13.092
- It looks like a sandwich!

1297
00:55:13.135 --> 00:55:16.530
- It's a chicken salad
sandwich on a Portuguese roll.

1298
00:55:16.574 --> 00:55:18.271
[Kitty laughing maniacally]
- Is that R-O-L-L.

1299
00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:20.969
or R-O-L-E. baby?

1300
00:55:21.013 --> 00:55:23.624
- It's a sandwich roll.
R-O-L-L. you buffoon.

1301
00:55:23.668 --> 00:55:25.626
- You are not going to cross us.

1302
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:27.933
We come from a wrestling family.

1303
00:55:27.976 --> 00:55:30.544
- Stay right there
Cassandra. don't move

1304
00:55:30.588 --> 00:55:32.024
or I'll blow you to smithereens.

1305
00:55:32.067 --> 00:55:32.938
- With what?

1306
00:55:32.981 --> 00:55:34.461
A canister of tennis balls?

1307
00:55:34.505 --> 00:55:38.900
- [laughs] This is no
ordinary can of tennis ball.

1308
00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:41.816
- No it ain't. missy.

1309
00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:45.690
- These are explosives
wrapped in tennis balls.

1310
00:55:45.733 --> 00:55:48.170
- Uh huh. you got
that little girl?

1311
00:55:48.214 --> 00:55:49.824
- And they're
aimed right at you.

1312
00:55:49.868 --> 00:55:52.261
- Right at you.
little flower child.

1313
00:55:52.305 --> 00:55:55.743
- Will you shut up.
so I can explain this?

1314
00:55:55.787 --> 00:56:00.095
If I take the lid off. a ball
with burst out and hit you.

1315
00:56:00.139 --> 00:56:04.404
And when it does. bang. and
you're nothin' but dust.

1316
00:56:04.448 --> 00:56:05.753
- I don't believe you.

1317
00:56:05.797 --> 00:56:08.582
How can an actor
think of such a bomb?

1318
00:56:08.626 --> 00:56:11.672
No. he's hardly an actor.

1319
00:56:11.716 --> 00:56:13.108
- All right. do you
know how that sounds?

1320
00:56:13.152 --> 00:56:14.980
It makes me sound like
I'm a crappy actor.

1321
00:56:15.023 --> 00:56:20.159
- No. no. I mean. you're
kinda good. pretty good.

1322
00:56:20.202 --> 00:56:22.727
I mean. I mean. he's not
the best. but he's decent.

1323
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:25.643
- Okay. what she means is
is before I was an actor.

1324
00:56:25.686 --> 00:56:27.775
a great actor.

1325
00:56:30.474 --> 00:56:31.953
I was a special effects artist.

1326
00:56:31.997 --> 00:56:34.129
- Nonsense!
- No. wait. wait. no.

1327
00:56:34.173 --> 00:56:35.914
He was!

1328
00:56:35.957 --> 00:56:40.222
Ajax told me he hired
Wiener to do that.

1329
00:56:40.266 --> 00:56:43.400
the French kids
wrestling thingy thingy.

1330
00:56:44.792 --> 00:56:46.577
- You mean the diaper
dance in France?

1331
00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:49.144
- Yes. and I was a Marine.

1332
00:56:49.188 --> 00:56:52.800
- And he was in the Army
and he was in the Navy

1333
00:56:52.844 --> 00:56:54.976
and he was even
in the Guard Coast

1334
00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:58.632
- That's right. and
much more than that.

1335
00:56:58.676 --> 00:57:01.200
But right now. stay still.

1336
00:57:01.243 --> 00:57:05.247
or you'll get the hardest
tennis backhand of your life.

1337
00:57:07.859 --> 00:57:11.558
Now. we're taking the
money and the movie.

1338
00:57:11.602 --> 00:57:13.604
- Mhmm. that's right.

1339
00:57:13.647 --> 00:57:16.389
And we are gonna sell that
movie on the internet.

1340
00:57:16.433 --> 00:57:18.217
It's gonna be a one
them digital things

1341
00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.785
that you can't even
trace us down in Mexico

1342
00:57:20.828 --> 00:57:22.221
where we're going to be.

1343
00:57:22.264 --> 00:57:23.788
- You idiot.

1344
00:57:23.831 --> 00:57:25.616
You just narrowed it down
where we're gonna be.

1345
00:57:25.659 --> 00:57:27.400
Now we have to change our plans.

1346
00:57:27.444 --> 00:57:28.836
[screaming]

1347
00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.229
[Ajax honking]

1348
00:57:30.272 --> 00:57:31.622
[Ajax babbling]

1349
00:57:31.665 --> 00:57:34.015
[grunting]

1350
00:57:35.669 --> 00:57:37.236
[dramatic Spanish music]

1351
00:57:37.279 --> 00:57:39.543
[grunting]

1352
00:57:39.586 --> 00:57:41.066
- Freeze. you
dim-witted dumbbells!

1353
00:57:42.546 --> 00:57:44.373
- Yeah. freeze. freeze!

1354
00:57:44.417 --> 00:57:46.027
- Ronald. I got her.

1355
00:57:46.071 --> 00:57:49.117
Help Ajax and point
the gun at Wiener.

1356
00:57:49.161 --> 00:57:53.078
I don't mean weapon to help
me with this triple bozo!

1357
00:57:53.121 --> 00:57:55.994
- I. I thought you were
wrestling the elephant tonight?

1358
00:57:56.037 --> 00:57:58.300
- That elephant chickened
out. he was a socialist.

1359
00:57:58.344 --> 00:57:59.693
maybe even a communist.

1360
00:57:59.737 --> 00:58:01.956
- But you at least
helped overthrow

1361
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.176
that Congo dictator.
right honey?

1362
00:58:04.219 --> 00:58:06.700
- Baby. you know
that's classified.

1363
00:58:06.744 --> 00:58:09.007
but maybe I'll tell
you over a cold beer

1364
00:58:09.050 --> 00:58:11.444
and some bacon wrapped scallops!

1365
00:58:11.488 --> 00:58:12.880
- Will you shut up?

1366
00:58:14.447 --> 00:58:16.623
- Ronald. what are you doing?

1367
00:58:16.667 --> 00:58:17.537
- Just put the gun down. sis.

1368
00:58:17.581 --> 00:58:19.539
and everything'll be fine.

1369
00:58:19.583 --> 00:58:22.890
- Who's the barbells
now. huh? [laughs]

1370
00:58:24.979 --> 00:58:29.418
- Sis. you know. there's a
million dollars in that bag.

1371
00:58:29.462 --> 00:58:31.333
Between that and the
black market of the movie.

1372
00:58:31.377 --> 00:58:32.944
I'm gonna be set for life

1373
00:58:32.987 --> 00:58:36.425
and I don't have to live
in your shadows any more.

1374
00:58:36.469 --> 00:58:39.298
This time I'm the hero. not him.

1375
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:44.651
- I'll hit you with that special
spladle. Ronald. [exhales]

1376
00:58:44.695 --> 00:58:47.262
and then I'll souffle
you into a dirt nap!

1377
00:58:47.306 --> 00:58:49.134
- Not this time Ajax.

1378
00:58:50.396 --> 00:58:52.137
- Listen to your brother.

1379
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.312
Put the gun down.

1380
00:58:53.355 --> 00:58:55.357
