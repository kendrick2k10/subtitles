00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:33.903
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Move it!

4
00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.339
Up that rope!

5
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.689
Move it! Faster. faster!

6
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.864
Go. go. go!

7
00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:01.583
Nice work.

8
00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:03.454
At ease. Major.

9
00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:04.934
You've won.

10
00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.367
Never let your guard down. Major.

11
00:01:14.378 --> 00:01:16.119
even when you think you've won.

12
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.528
<i>On behalf of
President Bosik and myself.</i>

13
00:01:33.658 --> 00:01:35.965
<i>we are pleased to be
here today to announce</i>

14
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.054
<i>that we intend to sign an agreement.</i>

15
00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:41.536
<i>which will make Astovia
energy independent.</i>

16
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:45.192
<i>while providing clean oil and gas for us</i>

17
00:01:45.322 --> 00:01:47.019
<i>here at home in America.</i>

18
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.065
- Hi. Uncle Sam.
- Hey.

19
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:54.639
That looked like it hurt.

20
00:01:54.723 --> 00:01:55.941
It did.

21
00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:57.072
He's a good teacher.

22
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.205
Hm.

23
00:01:58.857 --> 00:02:00.558
I ran into your old buddy
Tobias Masters

24
00:02:00.642 --> 00:02:02.383
at the general's retirement party.

25
00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:03.732
Mm. good old Toby.

26
00:02:03.862 --> 00:02:05.650
He's quite proud of the JSOC designation.

27
00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:06.952
Yeah? Good for Toby.

28
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.166
I'm proud to be in MARSOC.

29
00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:10.478
It's good enough for me.

30
00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:12.306
You should be proud.

31
00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:14.236
being one of the first women selected

32
00:02:14.308 --> 00:02:16.223
for Marine Corps
Special Operations.

33
00:02:16.353 --> 00:02:17.572
It's no easy task.

34
00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:21.576
Incidentally. the general told me.

35
00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:24.056
off the record. of course.

36
00:02:24.187 --> 00:02:26.537
that the JSOC selection.
it should've been you.

37
00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:31.107
If you tell anyone that.
I'll disown you. okay?

38
00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:32.239
I'm in your will?

39
00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.936
Yeah. got a couple ex-wives

40
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:35.462
that are hopin' for a mention. but...

41
00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:36.982
Mm-hmm.

42
00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:38.117
But you are my favorite niece.

43
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:39.550
I am your only niece.

44
00:02:43.032 --> 00:02:45.730
You are my only anything
at this point. Allison.

45
00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:48.037
Yeah. you too.

46
00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.695
<i>It is important to usher nations</i>

47
00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.392
<i>that are behind
the United States in progress</i>

48
00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:53.434
<i>into the new world.</i>

49
00:02:53.564 --> 00:02:54.814
<i>It's incredibly important</i>

50
00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:56.713
<i>to give them the measures they need.</i>

51
00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:59.527
So... still a big fan of this president?

52
00:02:59.657 --> 00:03:01.703
Don't even get me started. Uncle Sam.

53
00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:03.705
You know how I feel about this guy.

54
00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:06.232
Tell me why you hate him so much.

55
00:03:06.316 --> 00:03:07.839
I don't hate him.

56
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.539
I just... I don't think he
deserves to be where he's at.

57
00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.109
The guy's had everything in his life

58
00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.933
handed to him on a silver platter.

59
00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:18.502
and yet preaches this campaign
of hard work and discipline?

60
00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:20.246
Yeah. sure. I bet life's pretty easy

61
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.552
when you've got a safety net

62
00:03:21.636 --> 00:03:23.420
like Dallas Edwards was born into.

63
00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:26.031
all money and connections.

64
00:03:26.162 --> 00:03:27.253
Put that guy in the real world.

65
00:03:27.337 --> 00:03:29.087
he wouldn't get elected dog catcher.

66
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.475
Well. the Falcon I know
is not the man you think he is.

67
00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:32.690
Falcon?

68
00:03:32.821 --> 00:03:34.605
Falcon's codename for the president.

69
00:03:35.563 --> 00:03:37.872
Okay. well. call him
whatever you want. Uncle Sam.

70
00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:38.914
The man is soft.

71
00:03:40.132 --> 00:03:41.137
I'd tell him to his face.

72
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.265
- Really?
- Hell yeah.

73
00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:43.846
You might just be doing that.

74
00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:46.574
Sure.

75
00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:48.100
You ready to come work for Uncle Sam?

76
00:03:48.184 --> 00:03:50.708
I already work for Uncle Sam.

77
00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:52.362
Not in the military.

78
00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:53.885
I meant me.

79
00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:56.279
this Uncle Sam. Waitman.

80
00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:58.629
Secret Service?

81
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.458
We are looking for someone
with your exact training.

82
00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.246
and you are. by far.
everyone's favorite choice.

83
00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:11.599
The answer is either yes... or no.

84
00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.429
Hell yes.

85
00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:45.502
What's on your mind?

86
00:04:48.113 --> 00:04:49.593
I'm just thinking how

87
00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:53.989
what makes the greats great
is how they handle pressure.

88
00:04:55.512 --> 00:04:58.602
Lincoln was under pressure
his entire presidency.

89
00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:01.039
the fate of the country on his shoulders.

90
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.347
FDR was elected in
the middle of a depression.

91
00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:06.610
then had to navigate the world at war.

92
00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:10.005
And Washington. he navigated war.

93
00:05:10.135 --> 00:05:11.659
navigated peace.

94
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:15.140
then just stepped away from power

95
00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:16.821
when he could've simply kept it.

96
00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:20.972
You act like you've
never been here before.

97
00:05:21.103 --> 00:05:24.003
I mean. how many summertime
vacations did you take with me?

98
00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:25.284
How many times did I take you

99
00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:27.218
to the top of the
Washington Monument?

100
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:29.375
Well. that's different.
That's just vacation.

101
00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:30.634
Oh.

102
00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:32.941
Now. I live here.

103
00:05:36.988 --> 00:05:38.599
So first day in Secret Service.

104
00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:39.991
What am I doing?

105
00:05:40.557 --> 00:05:41.735
How do you feel about coffee?

106
00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:48.742
We've gone over this
time and time again. okay?

107
00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:50.440
He's got his heels dug in on this one.

108
00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:52.352
Mark. you and I both know

109
00:05:52.482 --> 00:05:54.092
this is going to be disastrous

110
00:05:54.223 --> 00:05:55.575
for our partners in the region.

111
00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.054
not to mention a public
relations nightmare!

112
00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:01.143
You know the president's position.

113
00:06:01.273 --> 00:06:02.840
- But hey--
- Gentlemen.

114
00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:04.921
- Mr. President.
- I'm sorry. Mr. President.

115
00:06:05.016 --> 00:06:06.670
he insisted on talking to you.

116
00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:12.720
...Mr. President. is this really
what you want to do?

117
00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:15.679
Especially when Congress...Okay.

118
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.420
Doughnut patrol?

119
00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:19.248
Yes. sir.

120
00:06:19.814 --> 00:06:21.772
Everybody's gotta start somewhere.

121
00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:23.034
Yup.

122
00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:24.474
By supporting President Bosik.

123
00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:25.997
we're helping to create
political stability

124
00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:27.738
in a very important corner of the world.

125
00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:30.349
Eastern European cartels have
used the Astovian oil fields

126
00:06:30.433 --> 00:06:32.438
as a piggy bank. funding
terrorism. narcotics.

127
00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:34.372
trafficking--
Anything and everything.

128
00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.265
So no matter which way you look at it.

129
00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.919
it's the right thing to do.

130
00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.139
Regarding the cartels. sir.

131
00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:41.982
- Sir.
- You've seen the daily briefings.

132
00:06:42.097 --> 00:06:44.189
All the back channel threats
against the United States.

133
00:06:44.273 --> 00:06:45.709
against you. sir.

134
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.845
Since when has
the United States been afraid

135
00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:50.758
of this cartel. or any other. Mr. Jones?

136
00:06:57.982 --> 00:06:59.683
What's the deal with all that?
Doesn't sound like

137
00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:01.075
everyone agrees with the president.

138
00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:03.814
We don't do politics.
We do protection.

139
00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:05.428
- Good morning. Mr. President.
- Yes. sir.

140
00:07:05.512 --> 00:07:06.777
Good morning.
Madam Vice President.

141
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:08.474
What about the promises
we made to our voters?

142
00:07:08.558 --> 00:07:09.910
They expect us to do things differently.

143
00:07:09.994 --> 00:07:10.994
Nothing has changed.

144
00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:12.432
Big picture. everyone.

145
00:07:12.562 --> 00:07:13.958
But Mr. President. are you really looking

146
00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:15.916
to take on Congress this
early in your first term?

147
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.135
Did you hear the president?

148
00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:18.525
You may not like it.

149
00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:19.920
but you goddamn well better get behind it.

150
00:07:20.004 --> 00:07:21.745
As you no doubt already know.

151
00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:24.426
today's agenda has Falcon
doing a political photo op

152
00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:25.967
in the press room.

153
00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:28.047
followed by an event in the Rose Garden.

154
00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:32.234
Agent strategic positioning
and details to follow.

155
00:07:32.364 --> 00:07:34.497
Stay alert. stay ready.
Any questions?

156
00:07:36.978 --> 00:07:38.370
Doughnut duty. huh?

157
00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:41.809
Looks good on you. Miles.

158
00:07:43.724 --> 00:07:47.118
So... what do you think of our president?

159
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.208
I think he's the president.

160
00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:51.514
Come on.

161
00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:53.821
I know about what happened with that. uh.

162
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:55.300
senator's nephew and you.

163
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.393
Somebody who didn't deserve it

164
00:07:57.477 --> 00:07:59.522
got everything handed to him.

165
00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:01.481
just like Edwards.

166
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:03.570
I mean. the guy was born into money.

167
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.966
He got preferential
treatment everywhere he went.

168
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.662
and. don't say anything.

169
00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:10.490
but when his wife died.

170
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.059
he played the sympathy
card to get elected.

171
00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:14.581
Wow.

172
00:08:15.582 --> 00:08:17.235
We serve the chair. not the man.

173
00:08:17.366 --> 00:08:18.672
You sound like your uncle.

174
00:08:18.802 --> 00:08:21.202
She sounds like somebody
who understands her job.

175
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:23.854
You know. in the future you would do well

176
00:08:23.938 --> 00:08:26.073
to keep your opinions to
yourself. Agent Richards.

177
00:08:26.157 --> 00:08:27.245
Yes. sir.

178
00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:29.846
All right. let's go. move.

179
00:08:30.945 --> 00:08:31.946
Move out.

180
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:37.941
Good job keeping your mouth shut.

181
00:08:38.605 --> 00:08:40.479
When he gave you the opportunity
to say how you feel--

182
00:08:40.563 --> 00:08:42.957
Look. what I said at
the bar was between us.

183
00:08:43.566 --> 00:08:45.263
This is my job.

184
00:08:45.394 --> 00:08:48.356
Well. technically. right now.
I think doughnut duty is my job.

185
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.880
Don't worry about doughnut patrol.

186
00:08:49.964 --> 00:08:51.564
It's something we do for rookies.

187
00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:53.144
Usually. there's a guy from commissary

188
00:08:53.228 --> 00:08:54.537
who handles the doughnuts and coffee.

189
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:56.492
They do that to see if you complain.

190
00:08:56.623 --> 00:08:57.931
Complainers don't last long.

191
00:08:58.015 --> 00:08:59.147
And I didn't complain.

192
00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:00.760
Now. leave that be.
I already called.

193
00:09:00.844 --> 00:09:02.370
Somebody from commissary
is gonna come pick that up.

194
00:09:02.454 --> 00:09:04.677
Uncle Sam. I told you.
I don't want special treatment.

195
00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:06.328
- I got this.
- Allison.

196
00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:08.458
you're not getting any special treatment.

197
00:09:08.722 --> 00:09:11.812
I need you to go home. pack your stuff.

198
00:09:11.942 --> 00:09:13.378
and get some sleep. okay?

199
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:16.077
- I need you fresh tomorrow.
- What happens tomorrow?

200
00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:18.166
One of my agents called in sick.

201
00:09:18.296 --> 00:09:19.689
so I need you on the team.

202
00:09:20.864 --> 00:09:21.955
You're on Air Force One.

203
00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.190
We need the trucks.
Bring the trucks out quickly.

204
00:09:39.274 --> 00:09:41.363
Come on. Let's go!
Where are they?

205
00:09:41.493 --> 00:09:42.846
We've been waiting for an hour!

206
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.149
When the general says that we go. we go.

207
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.238
Come. follow me this way. Hurry.

208
00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:55.246
<i>We will. together. produce</i>

209
00:09:55.377 --> 00:09:58.989
<i>clean. efficient oil and gas
for both of our nations</i>

210
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.817
<i>in the safest way possible.</i>

211
00:10:01.426 --> 00:10:04.255
<i>And to consummate our joint agreement.</i>

212
00:10:04.386 --> 00:10:05.953
<i>and as a show of respect</i>

213
00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:07.955
<i>and support for President Bosik.</i>

214
00:10:08.085 --> 00:10:10.131
<i>we will be meeting in Astovia</i>

215
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:12.176
<i>for the signing of this historic deal.</i>

216
00:10:13.134 --> 00:10:14.091
<i>Mr. President.</i>

217
00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:17.126
<i>Thank you. Mr. President.</i>

218
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:19.921
<i>I'd like to say that the--</i>

219
00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:25.102
Toma Hasak. a man I
once counted as a friend.

220
00:10:25.233 --> 00:10:27.148
and very intelligent person.

221
00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:30.238
Why would you think that
I would ever allow you

222
00:10:30.368 --> 00:10:34.590
to broker a deal with
Americans for our oil?

223
00:10:37.419 --> 00:10:39.769
What do I always say. Bahrudin?

224
00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.988
"It's all about oil."

225
00:10:41.118 --> 00:10:44.034
Yeah. it's all about the oil.

226
00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:48.212
Oil that. thanks to the deal
you helped arrange.

227
00:10:48.343 --> 00:10:51.128
will now flow into American
hands instead of mine.

228
00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.044
How much did they pay you?

229
00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:55.788
They didn't pay me. they didn't--

230
00:10:55.872 --> 00:10:59.006
You and this puppet president of ours.

231
00:10:59.136 --> 00:11:01.269
you both sold out our country!

232
00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:02.662
No. no. we didn't--

233
00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:05.360
What?
What you say?

234
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.492
I'm not a traitor.
I'm not a traitor!

235
00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:09.799
- I'm not hearing you.
- I'm not a traitor!

236
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.497
Take off this tape that I can hear him.

237
00:11:15.239 --> 00:11:16.632
What?

238
00:11:16.763 --> 00:11:18.808
- I love my country.
- You love your country?

239
00:11:21.028 --> 00:11:22.856
It's funny way how you show it. huh?

240
00:11:22.986 --> 00:11:26.207
But I do!
I never steal a cent.

241
00:11:26.337 --> 00:11:29.166
This deal... this deal will be good for us.

242
00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:31.607
if only you give it a chance.

243
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.997
You are a fool if you believe that.

244
00:11:34.563 --> 00:11:36.783
a fool who betrayed his own people.

245
00:11:37.566 --> 00:11:38.828
Shoot this idiot.

246
00:11:38.959 --> 00:11:40.482
No!

247
00:11:40.612 --> 00:11:41.875
No. don't!

248
00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:44.094
<i>This is great for both of our nations.</i>

249
00:11:44.225 --> 00:11:45.792
<i>and we. uh. will work--</i>

250
00:11:50.492 --> 00:11:54.061
President Edwards
is right about one thing.

251
00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:58.935
Tomorrow's going to be historic.

252
00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:43.501
We are in.

253
00:13:11.573 --> 00:13:12.443
Hello?

254
00:13:13.444 --> 00:13:14.706
Honey?

255
00:13:17.666 --> 00:13:18.798
Guys?

256
00:13:22.192 --> 00:13:23.585
Daddy.

257
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:29.983
You're going to call in sick
for tomorrow's flight.

258
00:13:31.854 --> 00:13:33.654
I don't see you picking up the phone.

259
00:13:34.117 --> 00:13:35.249
Pick up the phone!

260
00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:36.641
Okay.

261
00:13:41.646 --> 00:13:42.691
Daddy?

262
00:13:48.436 --> 00:13:50.186
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Martinez.

263
00:13:50.264 --> 00:13:52.614
I have a family emergency
I need to address.

264
00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:56.270
I won't be making tomorrow's itinerary.

265
00:13:58.228 --> 00:13:59.273
Correct.

266
00:14:00.448 --> 00:14:01.971
Tell Dan I appreciate it.

267
00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.323
They're calling in a backup
named Dan Smith.

268
00:14:06.454 --> 00:14:07.542
He's brand-new.

269
00:14:08.412 --> 00:14:09.765
This will be his first flight.

270
00:14:11.415 --> 00:14:12.982
- Daddy!
- I know.

271
00:14:13.113 --> 00:14:15.506
No. Daddy!
Daddy. no!

272
00:14:15.637 --> 00:14:16.768
No!

273
00:14:38.573 --> 00:14:40.531
Falcon will arrive in ten minutes.

274
00:15:02.727 --> 00:15:04.338
- We are ready?
- Yes. sir.

275
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.561
We're going to fuck these Americans.

276
00:15:07.645 --> 00:15:10.953
No. that is not what we are here for.

277
00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:14.000
We are here to take back our country.

278
00:15:14.826 --> 00:15:17.960
and to do that. we need the oil.

279
00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:20.484
which give us the money

280
00:15:20.615 --> 00:15:22.573
that give us the power

281
00:15:22.704 --> 00:15:24.924
to do what we need to do.

282
00:15:25.446 --> 00:15:26.795
And then.

283
00:15:27.622 --> 00:15:29.145
and then. yes.

284
00:15:29.276 --> 00:15:32.583
we will fuck these Americans
until they bleed.

285
00:15:35.673 --> 00:15:36.631
Yes.

286
00:15:57.826 --> 00:15:59.326
You waiting for an invitation?

287
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.625
Check the front hatch.

288
00:16:11.709 --> 00:16:13.584
Make sure everything's
secure before we take off.

289
00:16:13.668 --> 00:16:15.934
Sorry. I promise I'll get
my head out of the clouds

290
00:16:16.018 --> 00:16:17.889
in a minute. but this is just...

291
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.320
I know. it's quite a sight

292
00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:21.113
when you see it for the first time.

293
00:16:21.719 --> 00:16:24.722
You. you got me that model
when I was a kid. remember?

294
00:16:24.853 --> 00:16:25.941
Of course.

295
00:16:26.507 --> 00:16:27.551
Still have it.

296
00:16:30.772 --> 00:16:31.972
Is everything all right?

297
00:16:33.122 --> 00:16:34.648
Well. Agent Richards is a no-show.

298
00:16:34.732 --> 00:16:36.215
We have two people
that haven't checked in.

299
00:16:36.299 --> 00:16:37.474
Are we covered?

300
00:16:37.605 --> 00:16:38.957
Of course. we always have people on hand

301
00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:41.241
for. you know. last-minute
contingency stuff.

302
00:16:41.783 --> 00:16:44.006
But you don't like last-minute
contingency stuff.

303
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.182
Well. I like when things
go according to plan A.

304
00:16:46.266 --> 00:16:47.618
Even though you always have a plan B.

305
00:16:47.702 --> 00:16:48.924
Hell. I usually have a plan Z.

306
00:16:49.008 --> 00:16:50.835
but I'm a big fan of plan A.

307
00:16:52.228 --> 00:16:53.273
Here comes Falcon.

308
00:17:39.623 --> 00:17:40.929
Mr. President!

309
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.716
Ladies and gentlemen.
I'm gonna get coffee.

310
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.241
get a little bit of work done.
and there'll be plenty of time

311
00:17:45.325 --> 00:17:47.066
for all of your questions.

312
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.725
Afternoon. gonna get a cup
of coffee. finish the brief.

313
00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:52.726
and then we'll get to work.

314
00:17:55.987 --> 00:17:58.164
Sam. better break this one in.

315
00:17:58.294 --> 00:17:59.469
Yes. sir.

316
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.561
- Morning. Mr. President.
- James.

317
00:18:01.645 --> 00:18:03.517
Good morning.
Mr. President.

318
00:18:03.647 --> 00:18:05.910
- Hello. Charlotte.
- Okay. what'd I do?

319
00:18:06.476 --> 00:18:08.435
The president isn't big on formalities.

320
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:10.872
- So no saluting.
- No saluting.

321
00:18:11.568 --> 00:18:12.526
Right.

322
00:18:12.656 --> 00:18:14.310
Morning. Mr. President.

323
00:18:21.317 --> 00:18:23.540
Just enough time for the
president to finish his coffee.

324
00:18:23.624 --> 00:18:25.194
<i>Good afternoon.
Mr. President.</i>

325
00:18:25.278 --> 00:18:27.326
<i>Greetings to all of you
flying with us today.</i>

326
00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.630
<i>We have about ten minutes
before we depart.</i>

327
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.720
<i>so if you can find your seats
and finish up your last task.</i>

328
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.983
<i>we'll let you know before we take off.</i>

329
00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:49.476
<i>Prepare cabin for takeoff.</i>

330
00:19:00.051 --> 00:19:02.601
<i>Air Force One. you're clear for takeoff.</i>

331
00:19:34.216 --> 00:19:37.001
Andrews Air Force Base.
this is Air Force One. over.

332
00:19:44.139 --> 00:19:46.289
Andrews Air Force Base. this is Air Force...

333
00:19:47.795 --> 00:19:49.144
<i>Come in. please.</i>

334
00:19:58.849 --> 00:19:59.850
The plane is ours.

335
00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:07.597
Astovian press first.

336
00:20:08.337 --> 00:20:09.382
You have a question?

337
00:20:09.512 --> 00:20:11.166
Thank you. Mr. President.

338
00:20:11.297 --> 00:20:13.040
Amar Hozman of the <i>
Novaya Pravda News.</i>

339
00:20:13.124 --> 00:20:16.084
and if I might ask.
why are you doing this?

340
00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:18.002
Your country claims it wants to go green.

341
00:20:18.086 --> 00:20:20.610
and yet you invade other
countries for their oil.

342
00:20:21.524 --> 00:20:22.743
No one is planning

343
00:20:22.873 --> 00:20:24.530
to invade your country. and you know that.

344
00:20:24.614 --> 00:20:27.264
I was asked to enter into
this deal by your president.

345
00:20:27.313 --> 00:20:30.213
and I agreed. because it is
one that I believe in strongly.

346
00:20:30.272 --> 00:20:32.709
Simply. there are things that you can do.

347
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.367
things that you should do.
and things that you must do.

348
00:20:35.451 --> 00:20:37.497
This is something that we must do.

349
00:20:37.627 --> 00:20:39.977
President Bosik and I
have negotiated a deal

350
00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:41.939
that is equally beneficial
to both of our countries.

351
00:20:42.023 --> 00:20:43.636
It creates many new jobs for Astovians.

352
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.570
which gives you greater economic
freedom and independence.

353
00:20:46.723 --> 00:20:49.773
and makes you a better strategic
partner for us in the region.

354
00:20:50.074 --> 00:20:51.514
- Thank you for your question.
- Mr. President. sir!

355
00:20:51.598 --> 00:20:52.773
Jennifer.

356
00:20:52.903 --> 00:20:54.078
What's wrong?

357
00:20:55.036 --> 00:20:56.342
Trying to send an email.

358
00:20:57.517 --> 00:20:58.648
Internet's gone down.

359
00:20:58.779 --> 00:20:59.867
Is that normal?

360
00:21:00.563 --> 00:21:01.869
Not on Air Force One.

361
00:21:07.657 --> 00:21:09.050
It's all yours. General.

362
00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:14.142
<i>Good evening. Air Force One.</i>

363
00:21:15.448 --> 00:21:17.058
<i>Mr. President.</i>

364
00:21:17.188 --> 00:21:21.410
my name is Azem Rodinov.
General Rodinov.

365
00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:23.804
<i>I believe you heard of me.</i>

366
00:21:23.934 --> 00:21:25.327
Sam. what the fuck is this?

367
00:21:26.546 --> 00:21:28.504
<i>President Edwards.</i>

368
00:21:28.635 --> 00:21:30.767
<i>your plane has been hijacked.</i>

369
00:21:30.898 --> 00:21:33.030
<i>All communications have been blocked.</i>

370
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:36.773
No cellular or satellite service

371
00:21:36.904 --> 00:21:39.123
<i>can penetrate this hub.</i>

372
00:21:39.254 --> 00:21:40.777
And right now.

373
00:21:40.908 --> 00:21:43.040
Andrews Air Force Base

374
00:21:43.171 --> 00:21:45.695
<i>is tracking a radar ghost</i>

375
00:21:45.826 --> 00:21:49.003
that assures them you are on course.

376
00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:53.094
<i>I'll be back in touch shortly
to let you know our demands.</i>

377
00:21:54.051 --> 00:21:56.619
You two. let's go. move.
Move out.

378
00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.406
<i>But for now. what is it you Americans say?</i>

379
00:22:01.232 --> 00:22:04.279
"Sit back and enjoy the ride."

380
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.716
You two. get Falcon
to a secure location now.

381
00:22:06.847 --> 00:22:08.808
I don't wanna go to a
goddamn secure location.

382
00:22:08.892 --> 00:22:10.854
Mr. President. I don't tell
you how to run the country.

383
00:22:10.938 --> 00:22:12.983
Please don't tell me how to protect you.

384
00:22:13.114 --> 00:22:14.684
Don't they have fail-safes?

385
00:22:14.768 --> 00:22:16.073
Lead on.

386
00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:19.166
All right. you're with me.

387
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.255
The rest of you sit down.

388
00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:21.639
and don't do a damn thing!

389
00:22:21.644 --> 00:22:22.906
Stay seated!

390
00:22:23.037 --> 00:22:24.038
Are you okay?

391
00:22:24.168 --> 00:22:25.390
You're in charge 'til I get back.

392
00:22:25.474 --> 00:22:27.433
Secure this location.
Let's roll.

393
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.287
What's the matter?

394
00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:59.595
I have asthma.

395
00:23:01.205 --> 00:23:02.903
I need my inhaler.

396
00:23:16.177 --> 00:23:17.399
What's your plan Z.
Uncle Sam?

397
00:23:17.483 --> 00:23:19.096
First. we have to take the plane back.

398
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.923
<i>Mr. President.
as you have no doubt surmised.</i>

399
00:23:23.053 --> 00:23:24.446
we have taken your plane.

400
00:23:24.577 --> 00:23:27.406
<i>By now. you are probably
in a secure location.</i>

401
00:23:27.536 --> 00:23:29.669
<i>My colleagues have taken as hostage</i>

402
00:23:29.799 --> 00:23:33.020
<i>all your staffers and
journalists traveling with us.</i>

403
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.587
No. please!

404
00:23:34.717 --> 00:23:36.853
<i>And all of you in the Secret Service</i>

405
00:23:36.937 --> 00:23:38.678
<i>who might still be out there...</i>

406
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.724
<i>You need to understand this.</i>

407
00:23:42.377 --> 00:23:44.684
Air Force One is ours.

408
00:24:06.488 --> 00:24:08.185
Will they see what's happening

409
00:24:08.316 --> 00:24:10.840
to Air Force One at Andrews Base?

410
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:12.886
The only thing
Andrews can see

411
00:24:13.016 --> 00:24:14.496
is what we want them to see.

412
00:24:31.905 --> 00:24:33.123
Hold on.

413
00:24:33.254 --> 00:24:34.777
<i>Mr. President.</i>

414
00:24:34.908 --> 00:24:36.826
<i>the people who have
taken control of your plane</i>

415
00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.654
<i>are willing to die to get what they want.</i>

416
00:24:38.738 --> 00:24:40.304
Goddamn it.

417
00:24:40.435 --> 00:24:42.785
<i>Any attempt to try and regain control</i>

418
00:24:42.872 --> 00:24:44.961
<i>of this plane is going to be futile.</i>

419
00:24:45.092 --> 00:24:48.878
<i>and ultimately fatal
for everyone on the plane.</i>

420
00:24:49.923 --> 00:24:52.624
<i>So right now. I'm going to give
you one minute. Mr. President.</i>

421
00:24:52.708 --> 00:24:55.015
<i>to rejoin the rest of the hostages.</i>

422
00:24:55.842 --> 00:24:58.584
at which point. we'll start shooting them.

423
00:25:06.505 --> 00:25:09.072
Forty seconds.
Mr. President.

424
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.036
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

425
00:25:17.994 --> 00:25:19.387
Ten seconds.

426
00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:23.347
Five.

427
00:25:27.264 --> 00:25:28.135
Wait!

428
00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:29.658
No!

429
00:25:31.442 --> 00:25:33.542
Tell your agents to
put their weapons down.

430
00:25:36.012 --> 00:25:38.972
Must I remind you gentlemen
who controls this plane?

431
00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:41.714
Put your weapons down!

432
00:25:49.678 --> 00:25:51.071
All right. listen.

433
00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:52.333
We gotta split up.

434
00:25:52.463 --> 00:25:53.900
That is not a good idea.

435
00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.902
You're faster. more mobile than I am.

436
00:25:56.032 --> 00:25:57.512
I'm only gonna slow you down.

437
00:25:57.643 --> 00:25:59.943
- Protect the president.
- What about the hostages?

438
00:26:00.036 --> 00:26:01.516
I'll go check on them.

439
00:26:01.647 --> 00:26:03.649
Remember. kid. you only have one job.

440
00:26:05.172 --> 00:26:06.347
Uncle Sam.

441
00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:10.873
Go.

442
00:26:16.966 --> 00:26:19.969
The general would like
to speak to you in private.

443
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.537
Please!
No. please!

444
00:26:50.304 --> 00:26:52.045
<i>President Edwards.</i>

445
00:26:56.571 --> 00:26:57.616
Rodinov.

446
00:26:58.355 --> 00:26:59.966
General Rodinov.

447
00:27:00.575 --> 00:27:03.447
<i>You're not a general of anything. Azem.</i>

448
00:27:03.578 --> 00:27:04.678
<i>You're a war criminal.</i>

449
00:27:06.102 --> 00:27:09.149
One man's war criminal
is another man's hero.

450
00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:12.718
and in my country.
I am a hero.

451
00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:14.807
Your people fear you.

452
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.157
They don't admire you.

453
00:27:17.287 --> 00:27:20.377
<i>For my people. fear inspires respect.</i>

454
00:27:20.508 --> 00:27:24.991
Listen. Mr. President. You will
announce from Air Force One

455
00:27:25.121 --> 00:27:28.342
that you are pulling out of your deal

456
00:27:28.472 --> 00:27:30.736
with this fake president.

457
00:27:31.388 --> 00:27:33.869
<i>and you will say that you have realized</i>

458
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.089
<i>the election was stolen.</i>

459
00:27:36.219 --> 00:27:37.699
<i>and if you agree with me.</i>

460
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:41.094
then the world will stop paying attention.

461
00:27:43.096 --> 00:27:44.271
You have one hour.

462
00:27:45.533 --> 00:27:48.971
<i>After that. we start killing the hostages.</i>

463
00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:52.671
And if you say no.

464
00:27:54.237 --> 00:27:55.935
I'll simply kill all of you.

465
00:27:57.371 --> 00:27:59.025
<i>I'm not a murderer.</i>

466
00:27:59.678 --> 00:28:01.505
Don't make me have to become one.

467
00:28:05.771 --> 00:28:07.511
<i>My man is going to wait with you</i>

468
00:28:07.642 --> 00:28:11.385
<i>just in case you are thinking
of trying to be heroic.</i>

469
00:28:13.213 --> 00:28:15.563
And remember.
Mr. President...

470
00:28:16.825 --> 00:28:18.174
<i>One hour.</i>

471
00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:33.363
I'm guessing you're not a real journalist.

472
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.737
Sit down.

473
00:29:05.004 --> 00:29:07.615
You are lucky the general
wants you untouched.

474
00:29:09.399 --> 00:29:10.705
For now. anyway.

475
00:29:19.888 --> 00:29:21.738
Mark. can I speak to you for a moment?

476
00:29:21.847 --> 00:29:22.717
Of course.

477
00:29:29.724 --> 00:29:31.598
I'm sorry to bother you. Mark.
but during dinner

478
00:29:31.682 --> 00:29:35.338
I emailed the president.
and CC'd a couple key staffers.

479
00:29:35.469 --> 00:29:37.036
May I ask about what?

480
00:29:37.166 --> 00:29:39.215
About the oil deal
we're making with Astovia.

481
00:29:39.299 --> 00:29:40.387
I know.

482
00:29:40.517 --> 00:29:42.131
but I still have deep reservations.

483
00:29:42.215 --> 00:29:45.435
and I wanted to make sure my
position is clear in writing

484
00:29:45.566 --> 00:29:46.744
before this deal goes through.

485
00:29:46.828 --> 00:29:48.699
- And?
- That's the thing.

486
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.879
Somebody should've
gotten back to me by now.

487
00:29:50.963 --> 00:29:52.924
even if it was to tell me
the decision was made.

488
00:29:53.008 --> 00:29:54.967
and it's too late to make a change.

489
00:29:55.097 --> 00:29:56.751
I should've gotten a response.

490
00:29:56.882 --> 00:29:58.361
That's unusual.

491
00:29:58.492 --> 00:29:59.667
I know.

492
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:02.104
I don't like unusual.

493
00:30:07.327 --> 00:30:10.227
Can you patch me through to
air traffic control at Andrews?

494
00:30:13.594 --> 00:30:15.344
This is Andrews air traffic control.

495
00:30:15.465 --> 00:30:16.687
What can we do for you.
Mr. Miller?

496
00:30:16.771 --> 00:30:18.036
I'm with the vice president.

497
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.120
We need you to check on something for us.

498
00:30:21.123 --> 00:30:23.085
Air Force One. this is
Andrews Air Force Base

499
00:30:23.169 --> 00:30:25.419
air traffic control.
Please acknowledge. over.

500
00:30:27.173 --> 00:30:29.349
Andrews. this is
Air Force One. go ahead.

501
00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:31.876
Air Force One. we have
Vice President Hansen

502
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.094
<i>and Chief of Staff Miller on the line.</i>

503
00:30:35.224 --> 00:30:37.186
<i>Good evening.
Madam Vice President.</i>

504
00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.358
<i>Mr. Miller.</i>

505
00:30:38.488 --> 00:30:39.794
- Evening.
- Good evening.

506
00:30:39.925 --> 00:30:41.277
<i>If this is about the president.</i>

507
00:30:41.361 --> 00:30:43.411
<i>he's got everybody watching</i>
The Godfather.

508
00:30:44.973 --> 00:30:46.235
Again?

509
00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:47.541
How many times is this?

510
00:30:47.671 --> 00:30:48.934
I lost count.

511
00:30:49.586 --> 00:30:51.243
The president wants to know
if this is important.

512
00:30:51.327 --> 00:30:52.372
or if it can wait.

513
00:30:54.635 --> 00:30:55.941
It can wait.

514
00:30:56.811 --> 00:30:59.211
Roger that. We'll get back
to you when it's over.

515
00:30:59.248 --> 00:31:01.348
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

516
00:31:02.121 --> 00:31:03.296
We're good.

517
00:31:03.426 --> 00:31:05.176
<i>Air Force One signing off.</i>

518
00:31:06.516 --> 00:31:08.605
Well done. Dmitri.

519
00:31:32.499 --> 00:31:34.718
Fucking Secret Service.

520
00:31:40.333 --> 00:31:41.943
I am going hunting.

521
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.997
We have to get you to safety.
Mr. President.

522
00:33:27.396 --> 00:33:28.963
Are you okay?

523
00:33:31.052 --> 00:33:33.011
It's pretty cold where we're headed.

524
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:34.316
Grab your coat.

525
00:34:24.236 --> 00:34:26.281
Don't move!

526
00:34:26.847 --> 00:34:28.109
Where's your niece?

527
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.458
Who?

528
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:31.463
Don't play ignorant with me. Mr. Waitman.

529
00:34:31.547 --> 00:34:33.158
I'm running a military operation.

530
00:34:33.288 --> 00:34:35.029
and my intel is good.

531
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.596
We know she's your niece.

532
00:34:36.726 --> 00:34:39.077
Now. where's Allison Miles?

533
00:34:40.687 --> 00:34:42.080
I don't know.

534
00:34:59.097 --> 00:35:00.405
It's your first time on Air Force One.

535
00:35:00.489 --> 00:35:02.239
How did you even know this was here?

536
00:35:02.274 --> 00:35:03.927
Stayed up and read the manual.

537
00:35:04.058 --> 00:35:05.625
Of course you did.

538
00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:25.862
Yes?

539
00:35:25.993 --> 00:35:26.994
Vlady has gone dark.

540
00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:28.778
and isn't answering at his post.

541
00:35:28.909 --> 00:35:31.868
<i>The president is free with
the last Secret Service agent.</i>

542
00:35:32.695 --> 00:35:34.045
<i>Put the plane on autopilot.</i>

543
00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:35.440
and get to the emergency exit

544
00:35:35.524 --> 00:35:37.225
in case they try to get out that way.

545
00:35:37.309 --> 00:35:38.658
I'm on it.

546
00:35:42.227 --> 00:35:43.228
Fuck you.

547
00:35:43.358 --> 00:35:45.012
Yeah. we'll see about that.

548
00:35:50.496 --> 00:35:53.368
<i>I've run out of patience. Agent Waitman.</i>

549
00:35:53.499 --> 00:35:55.895
<i>You're either going to tell
your niece to surrender.</i>

550
00:35:55.979 --> 00:36:00.375
<i>or I'm going to litter this
floor with dead bodies!</i>

551
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.813
What about the hostages?

552
00:36:03.944 --> 00:36:06.210
You really think they're
gonna let anyone off alive?

553
00:36:06.294 --> 00:36:08.544
Of course not.
Even if I do what Rodinov asks.

554
00:36:08.557 --> 00:36:09.909
I don't think he's gonna let anyone live.

555
00:36:09.993 --> 00:36:11.433
That's why it's up to us
to save the passengers.

556
00:36:11.517 --> 00:36:13.696
No. sir. it is our job
to get you off this plane.

557
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.567
You might be the president.
but with all due respect. sir.

558
00:36:15.651 --> 00:36:18.135
right now. I am the only
Secret Service you've got left.

559
00:36:18.219 --> 00:36:20.700
You say exactly what
I told you to say.

560
00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.615
or you're all dead.

561
00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:26.271
<i>Agent Allison Miles?</i>

562
00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:27.750
<i>We have your uncle here.</i>

563
00:36:29.622 --> 00:36:32.451
And he has something he wants to tell you.

564
00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:33.713
<i>Allison!</i>

565
00:36:33.843 --> 00:36:35.323
<i>Allison. we serve the chair.</i>

566
00:36:35.454 --> 00:36:37.064
not the man.

567
00:36:37.934 --> 00:36:40.372
You protect Falcon at all costs.

568
00:36:58.128 --> 00:37:00.087
Well. I guess that's one down.

569
00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:01.393
and. uh...

570
00:37:02.655 --> 00:37:03.656
None to go.

571
00:37:13.187 --> 00:37:14.406
Agent Miles--

572
00:37:14.536 --> 00:37:16.019
Sir. we have to get you off this plane.

573
00:37:16.103 --> 00:37:17.670
I'm sorry.

574
00:37:23.415 --> 00:37:24.720
You all right. sir?

575
00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:27.897
It's nothing.

576
00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:31.904
- We're gonna have to jump.
- Do we have a choice?

577
00:37:31.988 --> 00:37:33.163
No.

578
00:38:07.023 --> 00:38:09.287
That fucking bitch.

579
00:38:16.598 --> 00:38:20.036
<i>General Rodinov. over.
Air Force One--</i>

580
00:38:20.167 --> 00:38:21.821
You're breaking up.
Please repeat.

581
00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:24.650
President Edwards
has escaped Air Force One

582
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.565
with a Secret Service Agent.

583
00:38:26.695 --> 00:38:28.218
Why are you still on the plane?

584
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:31.047
<i>Agent Allison Miles. he's with her.</i>

585
00:38:34.007 --> 00:38:36.157
<i>She's the only one
left with the president.</i>

586
00:38:45.584 --> 00:38:46.976
What now. General?

587
00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:50.023
Show me the map of the area

588
00:38:50.153 --> 00:38:51.720
they might have come down.

589
00:38:53.592 --> 00:38:54.770
Based on the flight path.

590
00:38:54.854 --> 00:38:56.467
they would be somewhere in this valley.

591
00:38:56.551 --> 00:38:57.900
I see.

592
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:00.947
In 30 minutes. I want you
to kill the signal.

593
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.602
What do they know back at Andrews?

594
00:39:03.732 --> 00:39:05.382
Until I tell them. they will think

595
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:07.257
that the plane is still in the air.

596
00:39:07.388 --> 00:39:09.608
They'll start a search in the wrong place.

597
00:39:09.738 --> 00:39:13.133
and by the time they
figure out what's happened.

598
00:39:13.263 --> 00:39:14.395
it will be too late.

599
00:39:14.526 --> 00:39:17.703
Hail to the chief.
American pig fucks.

600
00:39:36.156 --> 00:39:38.071
Air Force One. come in.

601
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.120
Air Force One. this is Andrews
Air Force Base. come in.

602
00:39:42.858 --> 00:39:44.512
Oh. my God.

603
00:39:55.436 --> 00:39:56.959
<i>Hello?</i>
I'm sorry to wake you.

604
00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:58.140
Madam Vice President.

605
00:39:58.265 --> 00:39:59.266
It's Mark Miller.

606
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.095
What is it. Mark?

607
00:40:03.183 --> 00:40:04.733
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

608
00:40:06.969 --> 00:40:08.580
Madam Vice President.

609
00:40:10.712 --> 00:40:11.931
What has happened?

610
00:40:12.061 --> 00:40:13.585
We're still gathering intel.

611
00:40:13.715 --> 00:40:15.807
We're coordinating the search
with President Bosik.

612
00:40:15.891 --> 00:40:17.502
The search?

613
00:40:17.632 --> 00:40:18.677
For survivors?

614
00:40:18.807 --> 00:40:20.407
For bodies.
Madam Vice President.

615
00:40:20.505 --> 00:40:22.681
It's unlikely anyone survived the crash.

616
00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:24.204
Unlikely.

617
00:40:24.334 --> 00:40:25.553
Highly. ma'am.

618
00:40:26.685 --> 00:40:27.686
Very well.

619
00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:30.039
Mark. I'm gonna need you
on a plane to Astovia

620
00:40:30.123 --> 00:40:31.516
in the next two hours.

621
00:40:31.646 --> 00:40:33.561
A plane?
To do what?

622
00:40:33.692 --> 00:40:35.218
You're going to reassure President Bosik

623
00:40:35.302 --> 00:40:37.391
that America honors its commitments.

624
00:40:37.522 --> 00:40:38.523
Are you certain?

625
00:40:39.393 --> 00:40:41.224
We both know that you never
agreed with President Edwards

626
00:40:41.308 --> 00:40:42.265
about the oil deal.

627
00:40:42.396 --> 00:40:44.050
My very first act as president

628
00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.748
is not to revoke President
Edwards' signature deal.

629
00:40:46.879 --> 00:40:47.793
Understood.

630
00:41:09.684 --> 00:41:11.834
We need to figure out
where the hell we are.

631
00:41:12.252 --> 00:41:13.949
Pardon my language.
Mr. President.

632
00:41:16.561 --> 00:41:18.954
Oh. I've been known to say a bit worse.

633
00:41:19.085 --> 00:41:20.437
And I wish you'd call me Dallas.

634
00:41:20.521 --> 00:41:21.827
Can't do that. sir.

635
00:41:25.526 --> 00:41:27.223
We're surrounded by mountains.

636
00:41:27.354 --> 00:41:28.576
We're gonna have to get to higher ground

637
00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.968
if we want a chance at a signal.

638
00:41:30.052 --> 00:41:31.492
I'm in your hands.
Agent Miles. lead on.

639
00:41:54.207 --> 00:41:56.644
Can we get the trucks out here going?

640
00:42:15.097 --> 00:42:17.189
Let me know if this pace
is all right. Mr. President.

641
00:42:17.273 --> 00:42:18.884
We don't have time to stop.

642
00:42:20.102 --> 00:42:21.582
I'm fine. Agent Miles.

643
00:42:21.713 --> 00:42:24.803
Unless you need a break.
we should keep moving.

644
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.240
Yes. sir.

645
00:42:48.827 --> 00:42:50.222
Well. we're still surrounded by mountains

646
00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:52.004
and it'll be getting dark soon.

647
00:42:52.787 --> 00:42:55.587
This is probably our best bet
to bunk down for the night.

648
00:43:13.808 --> 00:43:14.983
Clear.

649
00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:18.639
All right. Mr. President.

650
00:43:22.512 --> 00:43:23.762
Let's get you patched up.

651
00:43:29.041 --> 00:43:30.651
I've got some water heating. sir.

652
00:43:30.782 --> 00:43:33.532
We should both get cleaned up
before I close your wound.

653
00:44:13.172 --> 00:44:14.913
Mr. President. there's. um...

654
00:44:16.131 --> 00:44:17.981
There's something you should consider.

655
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:21.879
The hijackers wouldn't have been able

656
00:44:21.963 --> 00:44:23.965
to take the plane without help.

657
00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:30.639
They had someone on the inside
that gave them everything.

658
00:44:31.494 --> 00:44:34.628
Schedules. security codes.

659
00:44:34.759 --> 00:44:37.196
passwords. everything.

660
00:44:38.327 --> 00:44:40.460
And for them to have all that.

661
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:42.680
it would have to be someone close to you.

662
00:44:48.424 --> 00:44:50.516
There's only a few people
in the world that it could be.

663
00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.900
and I don't wanna believe
that it's any of 'em.

664
00:44:57.346 --> 00:45:01.350
I'm better with. um. doing
these things than fixing them.

665
00:45:06.878 --> 00:45:09.707
That'll have to do 'til we
get you to a real doctor.

666
00:45:12.927 --> 00:45:13.928
Thank you.

667
00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:15.234
Of course.

668
00:45:30.075 --> 00:45:32.120
You know. it occurs to me that. uh.

669
00:45:34.209 --> 00:45:37.169
you've been running all over
the place saving my life.

670
00:45:39.127 --> 00:45:41.695
You haven't had any time
to process your loss.

671
00:45:41.826 --> 00:45:44.393
Mr. President. my uncle
would never forgive me

672
00:45:44.524 --> 00:45:46.178
if I didn't do my job.

673
00:45:47.266 --> 00:45:50.051
And I would never forgive myself

674
00:45:50.182 --> 00:45:51.879
if I let Sam down.

675
00:45:52.793 --> 00:45:56.579
So I need you to just let me do my job.

676
00:46:00.845 --> 00:46:03.151
Does that make any sense?

677
00:46:03.282 --> 00:46:04.500
Absolutely.

678
00:46:05.327 --> 00:46:08.591
A lot of people died in the last 24 hours.

679
00:46:09.288 --> 00:46:11.681
Sam. and everyone else
that was on that plane.

680
00:46:11.812 --> 00:46:13.727
each of them someone that I know.

681
00:46:15.163 --> 00:46:16.556
So we owe it to them.

682
00:46:18.297 --> 00:46:20.125
We're not gonna let the bad guys win.

683
00:46:26.131 --> 00:46:27.654
You sound like my uncle.

684
00:46:31.397 --> 00:46:35.705
That's the best compliment
you could give me. Agent Miles.

685
00:46:55.813 --> 00:46:59.642
Did you know that your uncle
wasn't a big fan of mine

686
00:46:59.773 --> 00:47:01.253
when he and I first met?

687
00:47:02.167 --> 00:47:03.345
He never mentioned that. sir.

688
00:47:03.429 --> 00:47:05.083
Well. he wouldn't. would he?

689
00:47:06.388 --> 00:47:07.999
No. he would not.

690
00:47:09.174 --> 00:47:12.830
Well. he never said so much.
but I suspect that Sam thought

691
00:47:13.439 --> 00:47:16.139
that I had everything handed
to me on a silver platter.

692
00:47:16.529 --> 00:47:18.096
Sam didn't think that. sir.

693
00:47:18.792 --> 00:47:21.392
- That's what everybody thinks.
- Sam respected you. sir.

694
00:47:21.403 --> 00:47:22.709
We respected each other.

695
00:47:23.928 --> 00:47:26.408
All my life people have judged me

696
00:47:26.539 --> 00:47:28.489
based on what they think that they know.

697
00:47:29.455 --> 00:47:30.543
I come from money.

698
00:47:30.673 --> 00:47:32.110
Everybody knows that.

699
00:47:32.893 --> 00:47:35.722
What they don't know is
that right before college

700
00:47:35.853 --> 00:47:39.247
I had a terrible fight with my father.

701
00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:44.513
and I did not take one penny of his money.

702
00:47:44.644 --> 00:47:46.994
He wanted to dictate
every step that I took.

703
00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:48.782
and of course I had to choose my own path.

704
00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:52.782
so I worked two jobs.
I put myself through school.

705
00:47:53.783 --> 00:47:55.263
finished ROTC.

706
00:47:55.394 --> 00:47:57.483
and then I flew jets for the Air Force.

707
00:47:59.224 --> 00:48:01.490
After the service.
I ran for Congress. and I won.

708
00:48:01.574 --> 00:48:03.881
and what helped me was the lesson

709
00:48:04.011 --> 00:48:07.362
that I took from
that fight with my old man.

710
00:48:07.493 --> 00:48:10.017
and it's the one that
I carry with me to this day.

711
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.580
And that's that you can't
make everybody happy.

712
00:48:15.762 --> 00:48:17.962
So you just gotta do
what you think is right.

713
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.339
Why don't you let your campaign managers

714
00:48:24.423 --> 00:48:25.873
tell that story to the press?

715
00:48:28.601 --> 00:48:30.908
I think the work defines the man.

716
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:33.301
not the story.

717
00:48:38.132 --> 00:48:40.787
My whole life I knew I was
gonna serve my country.

718
00:48:42.136 --> 00:48:43.659
My dad was a Marine.

719
00:48:46.749 --> 00:48:49.404
I barely remember him.

720
00:48:52.799 --> 00:48:56.150
Was an IED. early days of Iraq.

721
00:48:57.021 --> 00:48:58.326
and. uh...

722
00:49:00.676 --> 00:49:02.330
Well. Sam...

723
00:49:04.506 --> 00:49:06.856
Sam was the black sheep of our family

724
00:49:07.814 --> 00:49:11.209
for being in the Secret Service.
and not a military lifer.

725
00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.474
But he was the only one

726
00:49:15.604 --> 00:49:18.254
who didn't try and talk me
out of joining the Service.

727
00:49:23.873 --> 00:49:25.179
It's in my blood.

728
00:49:26.746 --> 00:49:28.533
Even if I-I wanted to do something else.

729
00:49:28.617 --> 00:49:30.228
I genuinely don't think I could.

730
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:33.318
Guess the truth is I...

731
00:49:34.884 --> 00:49:36.886
I don't <i>want</i> to do anything else.

732
00:49:40.542 --> 00:49:41.979
Me neither.

733
00:49:48.637 --> 00:49:49.638
I'm sorry.

734
00:49:50.465 --> 00:49:51.771
What for?

735
00:49:51.901 --> 00:49:53.207
For judging you.

736
00:49:54.904 --> 00:49:56.254
I'm one of those people.

737
00:49:56.906 --> 00:49:59.651
Everybody is one of those people
until they learn not to be.

738
00:50:05.437 --> 00:50:07.004
I'll take the first watch.

739
00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:10.830
Get some sleep. Mr. President.
You're gonna need it tomorrow.

740
00:50:51.091 --> 00:50:52.919
Oh. God. I'm sorry.
Mr. President.

741
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:55.139
No apology necessary.

742
00:50:58.838 --> 00:51:01.580
You'll never guess what they
put in the survival pack.

743
00:51:03.625 --> 00:51:05.018
Care for some coffee?

744
00:51:05.584 --> 00:51:06.628
Uh. yes. please.

745
00:52:16.307 --> 00:52:17.221
Don't move.

746
00:52:23.183 --> 00:52:25.011
Some people just don't listen.

747
00:52:33.541 --> 00:52:35.326
Stand down. Agent Miles.

748
00:52:35.456 --> 00:52:37.415
This is not a fight we can win.

749
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:11.710
How's that head feel?

750
00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:13.407
I've been better. sir.

751
00:53:14.669 --> 00:53:16.802
I think. at this point.

752
00:53:16.932 --> 00:53:18.673
you should start calling me Dallas.

753
00:53:18.804 --> 00:53:20.153
Can't do that. sir.

754
00:53:20.762 --> 00:53:21.812
Just like your uncle.

755
00:53:21.894 --> 00:53:23.374
Certainly hope so.

756
00:53:28.422 --> 00:53:30.729
I can see that he's taught you so much.

757
00:53:33.688 --> 00:53:34.950
I'm sorry.

758
00:53:35.603 --> 00:53:37.953
It's not fair to lose
someone that close to you.

759
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:40.217
He taught me everything.

760
00:53:43.611 --> 00:53:45.483
He told me once. "If life was fair.

761
00:53:45.613 --> 00:53:47.876
the world wouldn't need people like us."

762
00:53:49.443 --> 00:53:52.707
He was. um. trying to soften
the blow over some thing

763
00:53:52.838 --> 00:53:54.318
I got passed over years ago.

764
00:53:55.319 --> 00:53:56.581
Tobias Masters?

765
00:53:58.409 --> 00:53:59.409
You know about Toby?

766
00:53:59.497 --> 00:54:00.498
Of course.

767
00:54:00.628 --> 00:54:01.676
His uncle. the senator.

768
00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.805
is an insufferable prick.

769
00:54:03.936 --> 00:54:06.721
and from what I gather. so is the nephew.

770
00:54:06.852 --> 00:54:09.162
- How do you know all that?
- Because I know everything

771
00:54:09.246 --> 00:54:11.196
about the people around me.
Agent Miles.

772
00:54:14.033 --> 00:54:15.426
Now. you tell me.

773
00:54:16.427 --> 00:54:19.125
what would Sam Waitman
do in this situation?

774
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:24.435
Formulate a plan. or 26.

775
00:54:24.565 --> 00:54:26.393
to get Falcon outta here safely.

776
00:54:27.438 --> 00:54:29.048
Oh. that's you. by the way.

777
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:32.573
I think I know my own codename.

778
00:54:33.574 --> 00:54:35.707
And that sounds just like Sam.

779
00:54:36.751 --> 00:54:39.841
Problem is this ain't <i>
The Count of Monte Cristo.</i>

780
00:54:40.451 --> 00:54:43.758
We don't have time to
dig a secret tunnel out. So...

781
00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.220
Our best bet is gonna be

782
00:54:46.326 --> 00:54:48.226
to make a play for time.
Mr. President.

783
00:54:49.242 --> 00:54:51.940
Rodinov may say he's a general.
but he's a thug.

784
00:54:52.767 --> 00:54:54.769
Sooner or later. he will make a mistake.

785
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:55.988
And if he does?

786
00:54:56.118 --> 00:54:58.295
Not if. sir. when.

787
00:55:01.602 --> 00:55:04.170
And it'll be the last mistake
he ever makes.

788
00:55:09.393 --> 00:55:10.481
Come.

789
00:55:21.535 --> 00:55:22.884
What's wrong?

790
00:55:25.539 --> 00:55:27.324
- Speak.
- American Vice President

791
00:55:27.454 --> 00:55:29.590
has announced her plan to honor
her predecessor's deal

792
00:55:29.674 --> 00:55:31.110
with Bosik.

793
00:55:32.633 --> 00:55:34.287
What about the high command?

794
00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:36.771
The high command
will not rally to your side

795
00:55:36.855 --> 00:55:39.074
as long as deal is in place.

796
00:55:43.731 --> 00:55:45.298
We have work to do.

797
00:56:04.491 --> 00:56:07.625
Mr. President. you will come now.

798
00:56:19.941 --> 00:56:21.160
I'll walk on my own.

799
00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:56.804
Hi.

800
00:56:59.851 --> 00:57:02.723
You know what this place used to be?

801
00:57:02.854 --> 00:57:05.291
A dairy processing plant.

802
00:57:05.422 --> 00:57:06.556
And what happened?

803
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.556
It was bought by an American company.

804
00:57:09.687 --> 00:57:13.342
who sold off machines. closed the plant.

805
00:57:13.473 --> 00:57:16.084
and started selling
German milk.

806
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.438
We didn't need
German milk.

807
00:57:22.526 --> 00:57:24.441
Now. it's all we drink.

808
00:57:25.964 --> 00:57:27.011
You were still general.

809
00:57:27.095 --> 00:57:28.317
The military owned everything

810
00:57:28.401 --> 00:57:30.490
back when this factory was sold off. yes?

811
00:57:30.621 --> 00:57:32.187
What of it?

812
00:57:32.318 --> 00:57:34.494
I know how things worked under you.

813
00:57:34.625 --> 00:57:37.275
Anyone wishing to do business
here had to pay you off.

814
00:57:38.063 --> 00:57:40.674
The factory was supposed to remain open.

815
00:57:40.805 --> 00:57:42.067
They lied to me!

816
00:57:42.197 --> 00:57:43.634
Now. you're just complaining

817
00:57:43.764 --> 00:57:45.290
that they're better crooks than you.

818
00:57:45.374 --> 00:57:47.574
You think I was stealing
from my own country?

819
00:57:48.247 --> 00:57:49.727
It was capitalism.

820
00:57:49.857 --> 00:57:52.469
and you Americans gave it to us.

821
00:57:52.599 --> 00:57:54.993
Your government wanted us to get rich.

822
00:57:55.123 --> 00:57:56.908
forget who we are. who we were.

823
00:57:57.561 --> 00:58:01.129
You know nothing about
our history. about our life.

824
00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.740
our culture. religion.

825
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:06.004
You people turn us into you.

826
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.573
and hate what you see.

827
00:58:09.703 --> 00:58:13.359
Know what? I would like
to kill you right now.

828
00:58:19.017 --> 00:58:20.366
But I will not kill you.

829
00:58:21.323 --> 00:58:22.890
because I'm smart.

830
00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:28.200
So let us try

831
00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:31.159
and be civilized about this.

832
00:58:33.771 --> 00:58:34.902
Shall we?

833
00:58:44.738 --> 00:58:47.785
I was hoping we might
find a middle ground.

834
00:58:49.134 --> 00:58:50.439
I don't think so.

835
00:58:54.835 --> 00:58:56.010
Here we are.

836
00:58:57.621 --> 00:58:59.231
You did it your way. huh?

837
00:58:59.361 --> 00:59:00.841
Cheers.

838
00:59:08.283 --> 00:59:10.547
You know what I need from you?

839
00:59:10.677 --> 00:59:12.505
Why don't you tell me?

840
00:59:12.636 --> 00:59:17.379
Your vice president has
done some unexpected thing.

841
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:19.947
We were sure that she would kill your deal

842
00:59:20.078 --> 00:59:21.906
with our fake president.

843
00:59:22.036 --> 00:59:23.734
but she has announced

844
00:59:23.864 --> 00:59:26.954
that she plans to honor your agreement.

845
00:59:27.085 --> 00:59:29.435
and. uh. it will not be good.

846
00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:32.873
So you will kill this deal

847
00:59:33.004 --> 00:59:36.573
in a recorded video statement
that we will release.

848
00:59:38.879 --> 00:59:41.839
Well. I hate to spoil your plan.
but I will not do that.

849
00:59:43.405 --> 00:59:45.103
I think you will.

850
00:59:45.669 --> 00:59:47.148
Beat me all you want.

851
00:59:47.279 --> 00:59:49.586
Kill me. if need be.

852
00:59:52.197 --> 00:59:53.981
But I will not be threatened.

853
00:59:54.634 --> 00:59:56.897
I know you won't.
Mr. President.

854
00:59:57.028 --> 01:00:01.032
but I'm not threatening <i>you.</i> understand?

855
01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:04.470
I realize...

856
01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:07.255
You are ready to die

857
01:00:07.865 --> 01:00:09.301
on this stupid hill.

858
01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:20.573
But imagine the young woman...

859
01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:25.622
<i>Who has gone through hell
trying to protect you.</i>

860
01:00:25.752 --> 01:00:26.623
Nice knife.

861
01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:32.759
Now. imagine I turn my men loose on her.

862
01:00:49.384 --> 01:00:51.299
You won't enjoy this.

863
01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:56.609
My men will rape
Special Agent Miles for hours.

864
01:00:57.697 --> 01:00:59.351
and hours...

865
01:01:01.353 --> 01:01:02.702
...and hours.

866
01:01:13.582 --> 01:01:15.672
When they are not raping her.

867
01:01:16.585 --> 01:01:18.022
they will torture her.

868
01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:25.725
She will get to a point
where she prays to die.

869
01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.511
But I will not grant her

870
01:01:29.642 --> 01:01:31.296
pleasure of death.

871
01:01:37.345 --> 01:01:40.740
I will keep her alive indefinitely.

872
01:01:43.395 --> 01:01:45.266
And I will force you to watch.

873
01:01:52.752 --> 01:01:54.580
Every night.

874
01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:58.497
my personal physician will
give her a blood transfusion.

875
01:01:58.627 --> 01:02:02.414
if necessary. to keep her alive.

876
01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:04.895
And the next day.

877
01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:07.898
it will start all over again.

878
01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:09.029
and again.

879
01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:13.207
and... again.

880
01:02:21.912 --> 01:02:24.218
I will not give you what you want.

881
01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:26.397
but I am prepared to make a statement

882
01:02:26.481 --> 01:02:28.875
that the people of Astovia
should have the right

883
01:02:29.006 --> 01:02:31.922
to vote on whether the oil
venture moves forward or not.

884
01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:33.619
and that's it.
- No!

885
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.665
You will do it exactly as I say.

886
01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:39.668
and you will do it in presidential manner.

887
01:02:40.669 --> 01:02:42.933
What are you so afraid of. General?

888
01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:52.681
You will let me make my statement.

889
01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:58.557
and then you can tell
the people anything you like.

890
01:02:58.687 --> 01:03:01.473
and if you know them
as well as you say that you do.

891
01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:06.217
I have no doubt that they will rise up

892
01:03:06.957 --> 01:03:09.263
and stand behind you.

893
01:03:09.394 --> 01:03:12.789
Listen. if you don't do what I want.

894
01:03:12.919 --> 01:03:15.704
my man. Bahrudin.

895
01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:19.317
will flay the skin off Agent Miles

896
01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:22.407
one inch at a time.

897
01:03:23.538 --> 01:03:25.453
I've seen him do it.

898
01:03:26.193 --> 01:03:27.847
Now. tell me.

899
01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.764
do you think I'm lying?

900
01:03:43.645 --> 01:03:46.344
<i>You know what?</i>

901
01:03:46.474 --> 01:03:49.521
You will look presentable
for this announcement.

902
01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:51.175
Come.

903
01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.358
Very nice. yeah.

904
01:05:20.307 --> 01:05:21.439
Ready?

905
01:05:22.092 --> 01:05:23.745
Listen. Mr. President.

906
01:05:23.876 --> 01:05:25.747
if you try and change it.

907
01:05:25.878 --> 01:05:27.880
we'll just start recording again.

908
01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:30.230
And Mr. President...

909
01:05:31.536 --> 01:05:33.538
I need a good performance.

910
01:05:36.845 --> 01:05:40.719
The moment you've said what
you're supposed to say.

911
01:05:42.068 --> 01:05:45.419
I'll call off my men. and she can go free.

912
01:05:49.336 --> 01:05:51.512
Yosef. what's happened?

913
01:06:00.347 --> 01:06:01.870
Sounds like she is already.

914
01:09:58.716 --> 01:09:59.804
She's up there!

915
01:10:02.023 --> 01:10:04.635
Shoot her. shoot her!

916
01:10:08.247 --> 01:10:09.944
Don't let her get away!

917
01:10:10.075 --> 01:10:12.077
Where is the machine gun?

918
01:10:32.619 --> 01:10:34.519
Looks like you're outnumbered. General.

919
01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:37.363
You lose.

920
01:10:37.494 --> 01:10:39.060
You are still my hostage.

921
01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:40.366
I've lost nothing.

922
01:10:40.497 --> 01:10:41.647
You've lost everything.

923
01:10:42.499 --> 01:10:44.065
You just don't know it yet.

924
01:10:44.196 --> 01:10:48.113
The difference between us
is that you are soft.

925
01:10:49.288 --> 01:10:51.116
because you are weak.

926
01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.726
And I am not.

927
01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:54.946
I am ready to fight.

928
01:10:55.076 --> 01:10:58.123
I will kill anyone in my way.

929
01:10:59.298 --> 01:11:03.824
I'll kill thousands. tens of thousands.

930
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:07.611
for the justice of my people
and my country.

931
01:11:07.741 --> 01:11:10.091
That is why I will win.

932
01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:13.225
That is why you will most certainly lose.

933
01:11:19.753 --> 01:11:22.582
You grow tiresome.
Agent Miles.

934
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:38.250
We're done here.

935
01:11:51.916 --> 01:11:53.309
Thanks...

936
01:11:54.135 --> 01:11:55.180
Dallas.

937
01:11:58.096 --> 01:12:00.054
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

938
01:12:00.185 --> 01:12:02.448
Yeah. don't get used to it. all right?

939
01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:04.407
I won't.

940
01:12:06.191 --> 01:12:07.848
<i>This is Special Agent
Allison Miles.</i>

941
01:12:07.932 --> 01:12:09.412
<i>Falcon is safe and secure.</i>

942
01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:11.283
<i>I repeat. I have Falcon secure.</i>

943
01:12:11.414 --> 01:12:14.199
Need extraction coordinates
immediately. over.

944
01:12:18.638 --> 01:12:21.424
<i>Falcon's alive.
I repeat. Falcon's alive.</i>

945
01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:23.777
<i>I have the coordinates
of the president's location.</i>

946
01:12:23.861 --> 01:12:25.961
<i>Chief of Staff Mark Miller is in the area.</i>

947
01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:27.125
<i>and is on his way.</i>

948
01:12:27.255 --> 01:12:28.518
<i>Air Force activated.</i>

949
01:12:28.648 --> 01:12:30.824
That-that-that's great news.

950
01:12:31.912 --> 01:12:33.131
Send me the coordinates.

951
01:12:33.261 --> 01:12:35.061
We're nearby.
We'll head right there.

952
01:13:14.651 --> 01:13:16.174
Mr. President!

953
01:13:16.914 --> 01:13:18.829
- Mark!
- It's good to see you alive!

954
01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.095
Mark Miller...

955
01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:27.272
Special Agent Allison Miles.

956
01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:28.711
A large portion of
the president's survival

957
01:13:28.795 --> 01:13:30.060
can be chalked up to you.
Agent Miles.

958
01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:32.059
Just doing my job. sir.

959
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:34.326
Mr. President. we need
to debrief you immediately

960
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.010
so that we can issue a statement.

961
01:13:36.107 --> 01:13:37.851
There's a small airfield east.
which we'll take off from.

962
01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:39.505
and he can take care
of wounds while we talk.

963
01:13:39.589 --> 01:13:40.636
Treat Agent Miles first.

964
01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:41.808
- Sir. I--
- Sir--

965
01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:43.636
Oh! I have not asked either of you

966
01:13:43.767 --> 01:13:45.162
for your opinion on this matter.

967
01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:47.121
You'll treat Agent Miles first.
That's an order.

968
01:13:47.205 --> 01:13:48.467
Yes. sir.

969
01:13:48.598 --> 01:13:50.382
- I'd like to stay with you--
- Miles.

970
01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:53.429
You're off duty.

971
01:13:54.255 --> 01:13:57.345
- Sir. with all due--
- At ease. Agent Miles.

972
01:14:00.827 --> 01:14:01.959
At ease.

973
01:14:02.089 --> 01:14:03.351
You've won.

974
01:14:09.532 --> 01:14:11.403
Never let your guard down. Major.

975
01:14:12.143 --> 01:14:13.971
even when you think you've won.

976
01:14:37.734 --> 01:14:40.171
Mr. President. what happened?

977
01:14:41.955 --> 01:14:44.305
All right. let's get a look at that wound.

978
01:14:48.527 --> 01:14:50.577
I'll tell you the story later on.

979
01:14:52.009 --> 01:14:53.489
So you're JSOC. huh?

980
01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:55.055
That's right.

981
01:14:55.186 --> 01:14:57.144
How's good old
Toby Masters doing?

982
01:14:58.319 --> 01:14:59.799
Toby. yeah. I know him.

983
01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:02.454
He's good. just saw him
last week at a briefing.

984
01:15:04.717 --> 01:15:06.719
Then you know. uh. Scott Gray. too.

985
01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:09.072
He went over there with
Toby to be his adjutant.

986
01:15:09.156 --> 01:15:10.288
You know. Scotty?

987
01:15:10.418 --> 01:15:12.246
Yeah. Scotty.
Sure. I know him.

988
01:15:12.377 --> 01:15:14.031
- Yeah.
- Yeah. hell of a guy.

989
01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:21.081
Miles!

990
01:15:21.212 --> 01:15:22.782
One of these men claimed to know a soldier

991
01:15:22.866 --> 01:15:24.258
named Scott Gray. sir.

992
01:15:25.172 --> 01:15:26.217
So you shot him?

993
01:15:26.347 --> 01:15:27.221
Scott Gray doesn't exist. sir.

994
01:15:27.305 --> 01:15:28.480
I made him up.

995
01:15:29.568 --> 01:15:31.355
Miller isn't here to
save you. Mr. President.

996
01:15:31.439 --> 01:15:32.919
He's here to kill you.

997
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:34.225
Allison...

998
01:15:35.052 --> 01:15:36.532
I'm sorry. Mr. President.

999
01:15:39.099 --> 01:15:41.844
Your chief of staff is the one
who betrayed you. Mr. President.

1000
01:15:41.928 --> 01:15:43.713
Bet you never agreed with that deal

1001
01:15:43.843 --> 01:15:45.805
that President Edwards made
with President Bosik. did you?

1002
01:15:45.889 --> 01:15:48.021
No. he didn't. but none of 'em did.

1003
01:15:48.152 --> 01:15:49.762
Maybe so.

1004
01:15:49.893 --> 01:15:51.941
But this idiot's the only one
who's willing to kill for it.

1005
01:15:52.025 --> 01:15:53.418
Is that true?

1006
01:15:55.072 --> 01:15:57.074
Gonna kill me over a fuckin' energy deal?

1007
01:15:57.204 --> 01:15:59.904
I never would've expected this.
but someone had to act.

1008
01:16:00.294 --> 01:16:02.383
You went all in on backing Bosik.

1009
01:16:02.514 --> 01:16:04.127
so I did the same in backing Rodinov.

1010
01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:05.461
Something had to be done.

1011
01:16:05.996 --> 01:16:07.737
- Why?
- Because you betrayed us.

1012
01:16:07.867 --> 01:16:09.317
everyone who believed in you.

1013
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:11.004
We were supposed to do things different.

1014
01:16:11.088 --> 01:16:12.838
We thought that you were the future.

1015
01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:14.820
and then you just went right back

1016
01:16:14.874 --> 01:16:17.224
to the same old. same old.
making deals for oil.

1017
01:16:17.529 --> 01:16:19.183
In my wildest dreams...

1018
01:16:20.053 --> 01:16:22.953
I never would've thought that
you could've done this to me.

1019
01:16:23.013 --> 01:16:24.667
or to our country.

1020
01:16:24.797 --> 01:16:27.278
or to those innocent people on that plane.

1021
01:16:27.408 --> 01:16:28.848
Put that gun down or I'll kill him!

1022
01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.414
Agent Miles. do not
relinquish your weapon!

1023
01:16:30.498 --> 01:16:32.196
Marcus. look at me.

1024
01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:35.068
You're not a killer.

1025
01:16:35.199 --> 01:16:37.593
Yesterday. that was true.

1026
01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:39.725
But I can't let you walk away from this.

1027
01:16:40.683 --> 01:16:41.988
You died in that crash.

1028
01:16:42.119 --> 01:16:43.511
You want me dead?

1029
01:16:44.512 --> 01:16:45.601
Okay then. go on.

1030
01:16:49.082 --> 01:16:50.083
Do it.

1031
01:16:55.872 --> 01:16:57.790
Agent Miles. if he does.
you take him down.

1032
01:16:57.874 --> 01:16:59.223
Yes. sir!

1033
01:17:01.051 --> 01:17:03.227
Or better yet. take him alive.

1034
01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:05.272
where you will stand trial for treason.

1035
01:17:05.403 --> 01:17:06.709
Either way...

1036
01:17:07.797 --> 01:17:09.450
It's up to you. Mark.

1037
01:17:26.729 --> 01:17:27.904
Fuck it.

1038
01:17:42.745 --> 01:17:44.007
Mr. President.

1039
01:17:46.444 --> 01:17:48.489
Can we get the hell out of this place?

1040
01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:49.882
Absolutely. sir.

1041
01:18:26.049 --> 01:18:27.357
Cavalry's on the way.

1042
01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:29.359
Extraction team says
they'll be here in 30.

1043
01:18:35.885 --> 01:18:37.495
Why wait?

1044
01:18:40.541 --> 01:18:42.021
Are you sure about that. sir?

1045
01:18:42.152 --> 01:18:44.241
They don't call me
Falcon for nothing.

1046
01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:46.373
This...

1047
01:18:47.635 --> 01:18:48.724
This I got.

1048
01:19:28.372 --> 01:19:30.029
<i>This is
Ramstein Air Base calling</i>

1049
01:19:30.113 --> 01:19:32.292
<i>unidentified aircraft
approaching our airspace.</i>

1050
01:19:32.376 --> 01:19:34.117
<i>Please identify.</i>

1051
01:19:34.247 --> 01:19:36.293
Ramstein Air Base. this is Air Force One

1052
01:19:36.423 --> 01:19:37.776
requesting permission to land.

1053
01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.122
I have Falcon on board.

1054
01:19:39.992 --> 01:19:41.254
<i>Say again?</i>

1055
01:19:41.385 --> 01:19:43.346
Ramstein. this is Air Force One.

1056
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:45.824
code delta-five-eagle one-niner-delta-two.

1057
01:19:45.955 --> 01:19:47.608
requesting permission to land.

1058
01:19:47.739 --> 01:19:49.001
I have Falcon on board.

1059
01:19:49.132 --> 01:19:51.182
Ramstein. this is
President Dallas Edwards

1060
01:19:51.221 --> 01:19:52.875
on board Air Force One.

1061
01:19:54.311 --> 01:19:56.008
Approaching from your east.

1062
01:19:57.227 --> 01:19:58.402
Bring us on in.

1063
01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:09.530
<i>Nice to have you back. Mr. President.</i>

1064
01:20:28.258 --> 01:20:30.089
Mr. President. stand by.

1065
01:20:30.173 --> 01:20:33.219
And three. two. one.

1066
01:20:35.482 --> 01:20:36.919
Good afternoon.

1067
01:20:38.224 --> 01:20:41.619
It has been two weeks since
the downing of Air Force One.

1068
01:20:42.576 --> 01:20:44.026
and the tragic loss of so many

1069
01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.667
trusted colleagues and friends.

1070
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:49.891
In the days to come.
there will be hearings

1071
01:20:49.975 --> 01:20:53.065
and investigations into
how this cowardly attack

1072
01:20:53.196 --> 01:20:55.024
was planned and executed.

1073
01:20:55.763 --> 01:20:57.765
The findings will be made public.

1074
01:20:57.896 --> 01:21:01.465
Anyone found culpable or complicit

1075
01:21:01.595 --> 01:21:02.988
will face the full brunt

1076
01:21:03.119 --> 01:21:05.817
of the United States of
America's judicial system.

1077
01:21:05.948 --> 01:21:09.081
and the unbearable weight
of her military might.

1078
01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:13.738
I sit here this evening. alive.

1079
01:21:14.913 --> 01:21:17.916
thanks to the bravery and courageousness

1080
01:21:18.047 --> 01:21:21.659
of our Secret Service agents
aboard Air Force One.

1081
01:21:21.789 --> 01:21:24.836
most of whom gave their lives
to ensure my protection.

1082
01:21:25.793 --> 01:21:29.014
These were my friends. my confidants.

1083
01:21:29.754 --> 01:21:32.017
in many ways. my family.

1084
01:21:32.148 --> 01:21:35.368
<i>Our great nation
is no stranger to tragedy.</i>

1085
01:21:36.369 --> 01:21:40.417
<i>What is most important now
is how we respond.</i>

1086
01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:44.116
<i>what we do next.</i>

1087
01:21:44.247 --> 01:21:46.640
<i>We will get up off of the mat.</i>

1088
01:21:46.771 --> 01:21:49.165
<i>We will live our fullest lives.</i>

1089
01:21:49.295 --> 01:21:53.778
<i>We will adhere to our ideals
and our morals with integrity.</i>

1090
01:21:54.518 --> 01:21:57.303
<i>That is how we will honor
those whom we have lost.</i>

1091
01:21:58.087 --> 01:22:01.003
<i>That is how we will honor the heroes</i>

1092
01:22:01.133 --> 01:22:03.396
<i>who have given their lives in service.</i>

1093
01:22:04.528 --> 01:22:07.879
<i>We will not lash out blindly
like a wounded animal.</i>

1094
01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:10.795
<i>We will not engage in the performative</i>

1095
01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:14.146
<i>or theatrical to soothe our fears.</i>

1096
01:22:14.277 --> 01:22:16.975
<i>We will not declare war on an abstract</i>

1097
01:22:17.106 --> 01:22:19.412
<i>to regain the illusion of control.</i>

1098
01:22:20.413 --> 01:22:23.851
<i>We will not repeat
the mistakes of our past.</i>

1099
01:22:23.982 --> 01:22:27.246
<i>We will acknowledge
the uncomfortable reality</i>

1100
01:22:27.377 --> 01:22:29.553
<i>that there will be those
that wish us harm.</i>

1101
01:22:29.683 --> 01:22:33.296
<i>Dangers will always linger in
the shadows of our vast world.</i>

1102
01:22:33.426 --> 01:22:35.428
Tyrants will seek power.

1103
01:22:35.559 --> 01:22:38.388
and terrorists will attempt to intimidate.

1104
01:22:39.389 --> 01:22:41.565
And while we will remain vigilant.

1105
01:22:42.131 --> 01:22:43.654
we must also be sure

1106
01:22:43.784 --> 01:22:46.004
not to seed the grounds of despair

1107
01:22:46.135 --> 01:22:48.702
that allow their lies
and false promises to grow

1108
01:22:48.833 --> 01:22:50.574
in the minds of the desperate.

1109
01:22:51.749 --> 01:22:52.750
We will heal.

1110
01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.927
we will grow.

1111
01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:58.799
and we will move forward together.

1112
01:23:00.453 --> 01:23:01.846
May God bless you.

1113
01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:05.763
and God bless
the United States of America.
