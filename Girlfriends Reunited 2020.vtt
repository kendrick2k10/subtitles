[gentle music]

10
00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:06.457
- I really love my grandma Ann

11
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.416
she is the best grandma ever

12
00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:12.072
she made us some lunches today
just in case we get hungry

13
00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:14.552
oh she makes the
best chicken salad

14
00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:16.859
- Oh yes she do and that's great

15
00:01:16.902 --> 00:01:18.469
that she makes chicken salad

16
00:01:18.513 --> 00:01:21.820
because did you know I was
thinking of being a vegetarian.

17
00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:23.953
- Kim you're picky
about what you goin eat

18
00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:27.130
you are crazy about who you
go marry girl you had me dying

19
00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:29.393
when that boy came up to you
and asked you for your number

20
00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:31.047
and you looked at his
shoes and walked off.

21
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.440
[soft laugh]

22
00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:35.399
- That was so dang funny
but I have my face all red

23
00:01:35.443 --> 00:01:37.967
when someone comes to
me or my best friends.

24
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.447
I don't play that way.

25
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.535
[soft chuckle]

26
00:01:40.578 --> 00:01:41.884
- And it wasn't just
the shoes is it?

27
00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:44.234
that boy penis was
hanging down so long

28
00:01:44.278 --> 00:01:45.366
I was scared to look down

29
00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.758
you know how am I
gonna go on a date

30
00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:48.760
with somebody that can't
even pull his pants up

31
00:01:48.804 --> 00:01:51.502
that is so embarrassing.

32
00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:53.548
- Christie yo sure don't
play you the best bodyguard

33
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:55.898
we could have but you know what?

34
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:58.814
Grandma Ann is always
jelly don't lose your cool

35
00:01:58.857 --> 00:02:00.337
think before you act.

36
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:01.251
- You remember that
time when that boy

37
00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:02.513
let his dog off the leash?

38
00:02:02.557 --> 00:02:04.428
And it started chasing
us down the street

39
00:02:04.472 --> 00:02:05.951
and the next day Chris
still introduced him

40
00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:07.388
to the Nutcracker?

41
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:10.042
Oh my gosh I was laughing.

42
00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:12.175
- But it wasn't funny when
that dog was chasing us

43
00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.221
my knees were on
point to the next day

44
00:02:14.264 --> 00:02:16.310
he know better than
to mess with us again.

45
00:02:16.353 --> 00:02:17.789
- You know he was
wrong for that too

46
00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:20.531
what if that dog would have
bit one of my pretty legs?

47
00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:21.880
I mean who wants a fashion model

48
00:02:21.924 --> 00:02:24.100
with dog bites all
over their legs?

49
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.495
It could have messed my chance
of being the next top model.

50
00:02:27.538 --> 00:02:30.585
- Well Chris threw away
his chance of having kids

51
00:02:30.628 --> 00:02:33.544
he still walks funny all over

52
00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:36.808
I kind of feel sorry for him
I hate to see people harmed

53
00:02:36.852 --> 00:02:40.160
which is what my grandma Ann
says I should be a nurse.

54
00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:42.814
- I was wondering what I
wanted to be when I grew up?

55
00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:46.296
Stacey didn't you say
you want to be a model?

56
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.082
I like modeling too but I
think I'll just be an actress

57
00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:52.520
or maybe even start
my own business.

58
00:02:52.563 --> 00:02:55.262
- Kim now I can see you
being an actress for sure

59
00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:58.178
the way your
personality just changes

60
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:00.441
are you still enrolling
for summer arts class?

61
00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:03.574
- Oh yes acting is so passionate

62
00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:06.534
did ya'll see the play
that I did last year

63
00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:09.624
at school it was great.

64
00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.279
- Yeah but there aren't
lot of female bodyguards

65
00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:14.455
I think I might become
a police officer

66
00:03:14.498 --> 00:03:16.065
Or maybe when we
get into high school

67
00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:19.416
I'm gonna go into ROTC really
girl yes there's a whole bunch

68
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.725
of cute guys in that class
and they liked me too so.

69
00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:26.380
- I don't know about that
Crystal 'cause you know

70
00:03:26.423 --> 00:03:27.990
if you would have
been a police officer.

71
00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:29.731
you would have got
suspended every week

72
00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:32.908
because of your temper but you
know I have a lot of clothes

73
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.258
so maybe I should be
a fashion designer.

74
00:03:35.302 --> 00:03:38.914
- But I'll look cute in
uniform but you right

75
00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:40.698
maybe we should
all become models

76
00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:43.527
and travel the world just to
get out of the neighborhood.

77
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:45.660
- The neighborhood
what you talking about?

78
00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:47.052
You know when we get older

79
00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:49.577
we're gonna look back
at these good old times

80
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.318
you know grandma Ann
always says never forget

81
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:52.493
where you came from.

82
00:03:52.536 --> 00:03:54.582
- We have our whole
lives ahead of us

83
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:58.542
I'm sure we'll figure something
out best friends always

84
00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:01.632
so as long as we have
each we gon' be A1.

85
00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:05.070
- Talking about the neighborhood
there goes Jack B coming.

86
00:04:05.114 --> 00:04:08.204
- Jack B come here Where
you think you going?

87
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.901
I know you see us right here.

88
00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:11.729
- I am on my way
what's ya'll business?

89
00:04:11.773 --> 00:04:13.688
Ya'll sitting around like we
do when we were five years old

90
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:15.472
where ya'll boyfriends at?

91
00:04:15.516 --> 00:04:16.865
- You know we ain't
got no boyfriends

92
00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:18.736
but you always got jokes
where your girlfriend at?

93
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.261
- Hey nobody has any
excuse or rights on me

94
00:04:21.304 --> 00:04:23.132
I am a freelancer but
I am thinking about

95
00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:24.699
who I'm gonna to
take to the prom

96
00:04:24.742 --> 00:04:25.961
when I get in high school.

97
00:04:26.004 --> 00:04:28.572
- Jack B that's too
far from here to there.

98
00:04:28.616 --> 00:04:29.878
[scoffs]

99
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:31.227
- Yeah right the
way I like every boy

100
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.447
within a mile radius is
pooling I see you for

101
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.319
I heard what Chris used do
to do he still walks funny.

102
00:04:36.363 --> 00:04:37.842
- At least he's still walking.

103
00:04:37.886 --> 00:04:40.105
He let his dog lose on
us I wouldn't be too mad.

104
00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:41.411
[children chattering]
[laughs]

105
00:04:41.455 --> 00:04:43.979
- Now he did what I bet
that was funny as hell

106
00:04:44.022 --> 00:04:45.894
I wish I could have really
laughed at that one.

107
00:04:45.937 --> 00:04:48.723
- Yeah it's funny now
but it wasn't funny

108
00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:52.683
when a dog was chasing us
I mean all I was teeth.

109
00:04:52.727 --> 00:04:53.989
[all laugh]

110
00:04:54.032 --> 00:04:56.296
- I'm just playing baby
girl if I had saw that

111
00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:57.384
I would have helped ya'll

112
00:04:57.427 --> 00:04:59.211
that is if Crystal hasn't clear

113
00:04:59.255 --> 00:05:01.605
the see ya'll in the
wedding rehearsal.

114
00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:04.565
- I'm not hurt actually
I'm cool as fan

115
00:05:04.608 --> 00:05:06.436
but hey some people
be asking for it.

116
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.655
[wind rustling]

117
00:05:07.698 --> 00:05:09.004
- Why you look at lil
homie's shoes like that?

118
00:05:09.047 --> 00:05:11.485
You know everybody don't
got swag like Jack B.

119
00:05:11.528 --> 00:05:13.051
- I mean he's nothing
like you you know

120
00:05:13.095 --> 00:05:15.706
we both know that and
did you see his pants?

121
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.056
I mean he was sagging
so you know every time

122
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.058
we look at you it's all good.

123
00:05:20.102 --> 00:05:21.669
[scoff]

124
00:05:21.712 --> 00:05:23.975
- You always feel like
you stepped out a magazine

125
00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:25.673
so how you coming
with your record?

126
00:05:25.716 --> 00:05:28.763
We heard you was talking with
dad to take you to the studio.

127
00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:32.157
- It's all good they said
the gon' take me on Saturday.

128
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:33.681
I'm going to buy me a studio

129
00:05:33.724 --> 00:05:35.422
when I get older and I'm going
[children chattering]

130
00:05:35.465 --> 00:05:37.641
straight to the top I'm
already writing a song for that

131
00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:39.295
I got too much time.

132
00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:42.385
- We know you had all that
going on but what can we do?

133
00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:43.778
You know we love to model.

134
00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:46.824
- Yes we do and we was just
talking about our futures

135
00:05:46.868 --> 00:05:50.437
but instead I think I'm just
gonna start my own business.

136
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.701
- We can do whatever we put
our minds to never forget that

137
00:05:53.744 --> 00:05:57.357
and as long as we work
together the sky's the limit.

138
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.142
- I hope we stay in touch with
each other after we graduate

139
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:02.927
'cause most times friends
lose touch with each other

140
00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:04.625
if they don't go
to the same college

141
00:06:04.668 --> 00:06:07.628
or even if they
just get out touch.

142
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.456
- They just happen
a lot especially

143
00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:12.110
in the entertainment
industry one day you're home

144
00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:14.156
then the next day
you're on a show.

145
00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.247
- It's time for a group
hug I love you guys.

146
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.074
[ALL ]: aaaaawww

147
00:06:19.117 --> 00:06:21.468
[all laugh]

148
00:06:22.773 --> 00:06:25.297
- Well ya'll do good
the dance is next week

149
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:26.821
we all going right?

150
00:06:26.864 --> 00:06:29.737
- I will go but I'm
not really into parties

151
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.956
but just because there'll
be some cute guys there

152
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.741
i'ma show up and show out

153
00:06:33.784 --> 00:06:35.830
- See that's the
problem with you Crystal

154
00:06:35.873 --> 00:06:37.048
you always gotta show out.

155
00:06:37.092 --> 00:06:39.399
- Hey that's just my
girl being herself

156
00:06:39.442 --> 00:06:42.445
but you know I should go
I should be a cheerleader

157
00:06:42.489 --> 00:06:43.707
because you know
I like to work out

158
00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:45.535
and keep my body in shape

159
00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:48.277
and you know dance
is like really fun.

160
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.105
- I guess I'll go to the dance

161
00:06:50.148 --> 00:06:51.715
got nothing else to
do beside sitting home

162
00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.414
with grandma Ann so count me in.

163
00:06:54.457 --> 00:06:57.852
- Well I guess I'm there too
but I hope we do not rhyme

164
00:06:57.895 --> 00:06:59.680
because I'm not feeling
messing up my hair

165
00:06:59.723 --> 00:07:01.029
and I won't bear with it.

166
00:07:01.072 --> 00:07:02.334
[soft laugh]
[scoffs]

167
00:07:02.378 --> 00:07:04.641
- Girl you so good that
you the only one there

168
00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:05.903
who will be worried about

169
00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:07.775
their hair being
messed up at a game.

170
00:07:07.818 --> 00:07:09.733
ya'll keep me laughing.

171
00:07:09.777 --> 00:07:12.214
- Jack B just make
sure you buy us drinks

172
00:07:12.257 --> 00:07:14.042
and popcorn and

I mean torn shoulders and
ripped buttons [sighs]

261
00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:43.632
If Crystal hadn't been
packing her pistol

262
00:12:43.675 --> 00:12:47.157

really really ugly

263

264

[soft laugh]

265
00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:56.645
when I told Stacey
to buy me these heels

266
00:12:56.688 --> 00:13:00.518

Now all I got is these pictures

319
00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:24.461
to take me back to
the good old days

320
00:16:24.505 --> 00:16:28.248
man I miss my friends I
wonder what they doing

321
00:16:30.467 --> 00:16:33.775
fabulous four is what we
used to call ourselves

322
00:16:33.818 --> 00:16:36.169
and now here I am just
sitting over here all alone

323
00:16:36.212 --> 00:16:39.259
with nobody to talk to and
nobody to call a friend

324
00:16:39.302 --> 00:16:42.218
this just isn't right there
used to be a time when me

325
00:16:42.262 --> 00:16:45.395
and my girls kicked it all the
way from uptown to downtown

326
00:16:45.439 --> 00:16:50.226
I'm talking till the sun
came up man I gotta find them

327
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.229
there gotta be a way
for me to find them

328
00:16:53.273 --> 00:16:58.191
the book yeah social
media got to the way

329
00:16:59.453 --> 00:17:00.671
all I gotta do is just
google their names

330
00:17:00.715 --> 00:17:04.066
and something's
gonna have to pop up

331
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:08.505
but this is a new year
and I'm in my prime

332
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:11.247
and I'm not gonna spend
it like some old hag

333
00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:13.293
I need to be living
it up with my girls

334
00:17:13.336 --> 00:17:16.383
all the stress I'm under
I can use a wild night

335
00:17:16.426 --> 00:17:18.907
of partying or drinking or
maybe just the night out

336
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.477
with the groupies with somebody
besides some horny Chad

337
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.219
I wonder if any of
them are married

338
00:17:26.262 --> 00:17:30.049

talk about finding Mr. Right

339
00:17:30.092 --> 00:17:33.095
well there's only
one way to find out

340
00:17:34.531 --> 00:17:38.274
and I'm gonna make sure I
get my girls back together

341
00:17:38.318 --> 00:17:41.190

and have some fun

342
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:44.193

Ain't no man perfect. You

847
00:36:11.908 --> 00:36:13.649

from your problems

848
00:36:13.693 --> 00:36:15.434
and try to solve them babies.

00:36:15.477 --> 00:36:17.218

what you right grandma

850
00:36:17.262 --> 00:36:21.266
but it's so hard to take
these guys serious these days

851
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:24.051
all they want is sex and money

852
00:36:24.094 --> 00:36:25.487
