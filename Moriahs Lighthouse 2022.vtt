00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:47.300
Salut. Maurice.

6
00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:49.467
Ah. Moriah. comment ça va?

7
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.734
Tres bien.

8
00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:53.133
Attend.
I have something for you.

9
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:55.133
Ah. my favorite.

10
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.934
Mm.

11
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.233
And what is the occasion today?

12
00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:02.400
Flowers are best given
when there is no occasion.

13
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:03.467
Enjoy.

14
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.133
Merci.

15
00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.633
Give Katherine my love.

16
00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:07.967
Oui.

17
00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:11.200
Bonjour. Regis.

18
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:12.533
Bonjour. Moriah.

19
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.567
Both: Merci.

20
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.033
- A tout.
- A tout.

21
00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:56.567
I'm not supposed to say this.

22
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.300
but. umm. I think
you're my favorite.

23
00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:12.533
Brigitte!

24
00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:17.867
Oui. Yes. it's finished.

25
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.734
Uh. yeah. how does
3:00 PM sound?

26
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.266
Super. Okay. I'll see you then!

27
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.433
Bye.

28
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.633
Both: Bonjour.

29
00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:42.300
I'm trying to find my hotel.

30
00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:44.166
Castle Beau Site.

31
00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:47.934
Vous cherchez un château?

32
00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:49.700
Yes. A castle.

33
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.467
Uh-huh.

34
00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:56.967
Gauche. Yes.

35
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.533
O-Okay. thank you.

36
00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:05.433
Uh. what do you call that?

37
00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:06.767
Baguette.

38
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.033
Baguette. same in English.

39
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.166
Une?

40
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.600
Two.

41
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.166
Merci.

42
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.700
Oh.

43
00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:39.333
Magnifique. Leon!
Comme toujours.

44
00:04:57.934 --> 00:04:59.500
Are you crazy?!

45
00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.834
Me?! You're the one daydreaming
in the middle of the road!

46
00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:03.600
You're the one
biking like a maniac!

47
00:05:03.734 --> 00:05:06.200
In France.
bicycles have the right of way.

48
00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:07.600
You could have killed me!

49
00:05:07.734 --> 00:05:08.867
Ignoring the fact
that I'm the one lying

50
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.567
in he middle of the road.

51
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.934
Ow. Ooh.

52
00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:14.333
Are you actually hurt?

53
00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:15.333
Nothing's is broken?

54
00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:17.700
I'm okay.

55
00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:20.433
but my lunch has
seen better days.

56
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.967
Probably my fault. I was
walking with my face in a map.

57
00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:33.333
Okay. well. just um.

58
00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:35.700
next time watch
where you are walking.

59
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.900
Bonjour. Moriah!

60
00:05:56.033 --> 00:05:58.166
Salut. Jacques.

61
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.200
Lavender?

62
00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:01.166
Yes. it's beautiful. no?

63
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.433
Would you like some?

64
00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:03.667
It makes me sneeze.

65
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.100
Very lovely though.

66
00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:06.767
From a friend. or...

67
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.000
From a very nice man
in town with a smile

68
00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:11.834
as bright as the sun.

69
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.233
They're from Maurice.

70
00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:16.467
It's a gift from Maurice.

71
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.500
Okay.

72
00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:21.433
Oh. this is from the post.

73
00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:23.600
It goes to reception.
if you please. kind sir.

74
00:06:23.734 --> 00:06:24.900
Anything for you.

75
00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:26.567
Well. and for the inn.

76
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.734
And for you. as well.

77
00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:29.233
But mainly for the inn.

78
00:06:29.367 --> 00:06:31.400
Entirely so.

79
00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:32.400
Ah. merci.

80
00:06:32.533 --> 00:06:34.967
Perfect timing.

81
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.600
Would you mind
helping with these?

82
00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:38.333
I'm donating them to the Emmaüs.

83
00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:40.233
Oui.

84
00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:41.834
Merci. Jacques.

85
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.467
Katherine. he's like my brother.

86
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.800
I know.

87
00:06:49.934 --> 00:06:52.667
but he's very sweet.

88
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.133
One day you might consider
thinking differently about him.

89
00:06:56.266 --> 00:06:59.000
There are worse things than
finding a man who looks at you

90
00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:00.433
the way he does.

91
00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:05.133
I went by the lighthouse
this morning.

92
00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:07.567
I'm still finding
trash everywhere.

93
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.834
And the day you buy it.
you can put a big long fence

94
00:07:09.967 --> 00:07:12.800
around it warning people
to keep out permanently.

95
00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:14.533
I'm teasing.

96
00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.934
I know you're going to share it
for all the world to see.

97
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.500
Listen. I know you hate
when I offer. but--

98
00:07:21.633 --> 00:07:23.800
It's important that
I find the money myself.

99
00:07:23.934 --> 00:07:25.200
Thank you though.

100
00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:26.500
I'm not far off.

101
00:07:26.633 --> 00:07:29.300
I just have to sell maybe two.

102
00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:30.834
300 more end tables.

103
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.200
Monsieur!

104
00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:37.400
Have you been in a collision?

105
00:07:37.533 --> 00:07:39.633
As a matter of fact I have.

106
00:07:39.767 --> 00:07:41.133
With her!

107
00:07:42.967 --> 00:07:45.233
Um. come and get cleaned up.

108
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.133
I'm just thankful
no one was seriously hurt.

109
00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:51.533
They way you ride
around on that bicycle.

110
00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:54.200
it's a wonder it doesn't
happen more often.

111
00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.300
Moi?! I'm not the one to blame.

112
00:07:56.433 --> 00:07:58.333
- He's the one that--
- There he is.

113
00:07:58.467 --> 00:07:59.900
Nice and clean.

114
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.567
Fresh as a daisy.

115
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.567
Good as new.

116
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.233
Okay.

117
00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:08.066
Thank you for the shower.

118
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.066
I was wondering if
you have a laundry room?

119
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.700
Ah. yes. just through there.

120
00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:15.066
Did we get a name?

121
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.300
Uh. Ben McCain.

122
00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:17.633
Actually. maybe you can help me.

123
00:08:17.767 --> 00:08:19.867
I'm looking for a castle?

124
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.100
Castle Beau Site?

125
00:08:22.233 --> 00:08:23.800
Of course.

126
00:08:23.934 --> 00:08:26.300
Mr. McCain.
I recall your reservation.

127
00:08:26.433 --> 00:08:28.734
We have you for two months.

128
00:08:28.867 --> 00:08:31.867
I am Katherine Beaufort.
the owner of Castle Beau Site.

129
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.800
Ah. Beau Site.

130
00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:35.900
And this is Moriah. my niece.

131
00:08:39.266 --> 00:08:41.700
Please forgive me. I have
some business to attend to.

132
00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:44.800
Moriah. darling. would you
please take Mr. McCain over

133
00:08:44.934 --> 00:08:46.266
and get him checked in?

134
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.433
But it's just right there.

135
00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:50.233
Pleasure meeting you.
Mr. McCain.

136
00:08:50.367 --> 00:08:51.633
Make yourself at home.

137
00:08:51.767 --> 00:08:54.033
We are at your service.
day and night.

138
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.000
Thank you.

139
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.033
Where are the rest of your bags?

140
00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:05.767
Oh. this is it.

141
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.266
You're staying
the entire summer.

142
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.500
that's all you brought?

143
00:09:08.633 --> 00:09:10.166
I got packing down to a science.

144
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.767
No bags means no hassle.

145
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.367
So. you can take it from here?

146
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.533
Wow. This is--
This is gorgeous.

147
00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:20.266
Locally built?

148
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.467
Yes. in fact.

149
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.600
The guy who made
this is very good.

150
00:09:24.734 --> 00:09:25.867
Look at this inlay.

151
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.266
and the veneers
are perfectly matched.

152
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.767
This chamfered leg.

153
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.433
Yes. I know.

154
00:09:30.567 --> 00:09:34.033
The guy who made it. she's me.

155
00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:36.367
Oh!

156
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.767
Seriously?

157
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.300
I'm sorry.
I thought you worked at the-

158
00:09:39.433 --> 00:09:43.166
No. I have a workshop in town.
I work for me.

159
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.266
Well. you have some real skill.
I'm very impressed.

160
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.033
Merci. When you live
on a small island.

161
00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:51.000
if you need something
built or repaired.

162
00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:53.533
and. well. if you
or your neighbor can't do it.

163
00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:55.133
then you're--
you're out of luck.

164
00:09:55.266 --> 00:09:58.867
So. we all grow up
loving to learn new things.

165
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.467
That's why I'm always
bouncing around.

166
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.934
I love meeting new people.
seeing how they live.

167
00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:03.767
seeing their world.

168
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.367
Life should be an adventure.

169
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.967
Hm.

170
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.000
Well. if you don't
need anything else--

171
00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:11.100
No. I'm good. thank you.

172
00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:13.500
Okay. Julie will check you in.

173
00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:28.967
I love it.

174
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:30.200
Really?

175
00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:31.467
Yeah. it's amazing.

176
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.767
It matches
the counters perfectly.

177
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.767
You're amazing.

178
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.667
Merci. Okay. I'm almost
finished with the second one.

179
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.600
and I'll have them
bring it by tomorrow.

180
00:10:40.734 --> 00:10:42.367
Perfect. perfect.

181
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.333
Do you know the most common
question I get from customers?

182
00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:48.200
How much candy can
I take through customs?

183
00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:51.700
I do get that one a lot. but no.

184
00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:53.600
Everyone always asks me.

185
00:10:53.734 --> 00:10:54.834
"Who did this
incredible woodwork?"

186
00:10:54.967 --> 00:10:57.500
- Ah.
- "Give me his name!"

187
00:10:57.633 --> 00:11:00.367
And I tell them it's all
done by a very talented.

188
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.233
local artist and woodsmith.

189
00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:05.400
philosopher and problem-solver.

190
00:11:05.533 --> 00:11:08.333
A true Renaissance woman.

191
00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:10.500
Wow.

192
00:11:10.633 --> 00:11:12.200
It doesn't say
any of that on the card.

193
00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:13.767
just my name and number.

194
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.200
And she's humble.

195
00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:17.567
That's why we love her.

196
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.233
Look. I know how
many hours this took.

197
00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:23.033
and I want to say that
I still haven't given up hope

198
00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:25.433
that one day you'll take
some time off so we can drive

199
00:11:25.567 --> 00:11:27.767
up the coast. or go to Paris.

200
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.767
I know you think
I work too much.

201
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.600
You work too much. I understand.
You're saving your pennies.

202
00:11:32.734 --> 00:11:33.867
All of them.

203
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.667
All I'm saying here is

204
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.834
if the invitation for adventure
should fall at your feet.

205
00:11:38.967 --> 00:11:40.233
take it.

206
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.400
You never hear
someone fondly recall.

207
00:11:42.533 --> 00:11:44.033
"Remember when I worked all day.

208
00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:46.567
so exhausted that
my days off were spent

209
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.533
sleeping and doing laundry?"

210
00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:50.000
I'll keep it in mind.

211
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.700
So. this is the basic idea.

212
00:11:57.834 --> 00:11:59.700
and then these frames here.
they are already built.

213
00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:02.934
and then once it's assembled
the we can add whatever

214
00:12:03.066 --> 00:12:04.333
decorative elements we want.

215
00:12:04.467 --> 00:12:06.667
That's already more than
I could have hoped for.

216
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.500
I love what you have done
with the curved timbers.

217
00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:12.567
This man looks very lost.

218
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.433
Oh. Mr. McCain!

219
00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:15.734
Oh.

220
00:12:15.867 --> 00:12:16.734
Really?

221
00:12:16.867 --> 00:12:17.800
You know this man?

222
00:12:17.934 --> 00:12:19.600
- Of course.
- No. he's--

223
00:12:19.734 --> 00:12:22.400
Bonjour again. I was actually
looking for a place to eat.

224
00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:24.934
but everywhere I go.
they only speak French

225
00:12:25.066 --> 00:12:27.133
so I just leave.

226
00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:29.834
The only words I know
are bonjour and adieu.

227
00:12:29.967 --> 00:12:32.233
Oh. hello and goodbye forever?

228
00:12:32.367 --> 00:12:35.333
Yeah. now I see why you go
in and out of these places.

229
00:12:37.734 --> 00:12:39.400
Back at the hotel.
the restaurant inside have menus

230
00:12:39.533 --> 00:12:41.400
both with English and French.

231
00:12:41.533 --> 00:12:43.066
Thank you.

232
00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:46.767
Oh. these are beautiful.

233
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.000
Are you getting married?

234
00:12:48.133 --> 00:12:50.066
You must be the lucky man!

235
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.266
We're not getting married.

236
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.100
Yet.

237
00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:56.166
Ah.

238
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.600
No. the fact is that we have
so many requests for weddings

239
00:12:58.734 --> 00:13:02.166
by the sea. and Moriah
has kindly designed this

240
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.734
lovely arbor for me.

241
00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:07.233
I actually do
a little design myself.

242
00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:08.233
Really?

243
00:13:08.367 --> 00:13:09.567
Houses mostly.

244
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.066
That's what
brought me to France.

245
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.667
You're building here
on the island?

246
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.400
Yes. in fact we start tomorrow.

247
00:13:14.533 --> 00:13:15.834
But I won't bother you anymore.

248
00:13:15.967 --> 00:13:17.200
Thank you for
the recommendation.

249
00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:18.567
and bon soir.

250
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.066
That's "evening."

251
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.333
Ah. Bon voyage?

252
00:13:23.467 --> 00:13:24.800
That's "have a good trip."

253
00:13:24.934 --> 00:13:27.233
Huh. Bon Jovi?

254
00:13:27.367 --> 00:13:28.667
You're halfway there.

255
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.133
That was funny.

256
00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:34.633
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

257
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.533
He's different.

258
00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:40.433
Yes. handsome and charming
with no baggage.

259
00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:43.166
I don't trust him.

260
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.700
Yes!

261
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.567
Oh.

262
00:14:32.834 --> 00:14:34.934
Oh. that's not good.

263
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.467
There are signs everywhere!

264
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.066
Do not overload.

265
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.867
It's simple enough for
a child to understand!

266
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.934
Maybe we should put
a diagram next to the signs

267
00:14:48.066 --> 00:14:50.233
for people who don't
want to read them.

268
00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:51.567
Who would choose
not to read them?

269
00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.800
Ben.

270
00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:55.300
Bonjour! Good morning.

271
00:14:55.433 --> 00:14:57.033
Another beautiful day.

272
00:14:57.166 --> 00:15:00.500
We were just talking about
the power issue last night.

273
00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:03.000
Yes. yes.
The power went out on my floor.

274
00:15:03.133 --> 00:15:07.033
It's. oof. wild.

275
00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:08.467
You were not disturbed. I hope.

276
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.133
Nope. nope. I was--
I was out like a light.

277
00:15:10.266 --> 00:15:12.467
A play on words. Very charming.

278
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.200
If you'll excuse me.
I must check in with

279
00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:17.600
the electrician to assess
the damage we have suffered.

280
00:15:17.734 --> 00:15:19.400
Bonjour et adieu.

281
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.934
Merci. Jacques.

282
00:15:23.066 --> 00:15:25.700
I get the impression
he doesn't like me very much.

283
00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:27.300
He's a little irritated.

284
00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:29.700
He did spend the morning
fielding complaints from

285
00:15:29.834 --> 00:15:34.000
angry guests and disposing of
melted refrigerator contents.

286
00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:36.500
Well. I. uh. I hope
he finds the culprit.

287
00:15:36.633 --> 00:15:38.000
Oh. they will be caught.

288
00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:40.500
People go to prison
for this in France.

289
00:15:40.633 --> 00:15:42.834
Seriously?

290
00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:44.367
Oui.

291
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.467
Uh. you know that
there's an app. right.

292
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.867
that can translate
French for you?

293
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.367
So if you don't know
what someone is saying.

294
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.266
or what a sign means.

295
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.533
Right. because I don't know
what any of it means.

296
00:15:55.667 --> 00:15:58.133
Mm.

297
00:15:58.266 --> 00:15:59.633
Hey. do you have any
recommendations for things

298
00:15:59.767 --> 00:16:01.233
I can do today?

299
00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:05.600
Uh. you could take a walk
or ride a bicycle?

300
00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:09.433
Just stay away from
the electrical circuits.

301
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.200
The prison thing
wasn't very funny!

302
00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:17.867
It was.

303
00:16:25.834 --> 00:16:27.867
Bike tour?

304
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.600
- Ah. Okay.
- Merci.

305
00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:41.734
Nice day for a little
jaunt around the island.

306
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.367
Awesome! Should be fun.

307
00:16:49.667 --> 00:16:51.300
Okay. Allons-y!

308
00:16:55.033 --> 00:16:56.667
Got some real athletes here.

309
00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:01.900
Here I come. Okay.

310
00:17:10.066 --> 00:17:12.233
Okay.

311
00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:14.500
The brochure
said tour of France.

312
00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:16.633
not Tour De France.

313
00:17:16.767 --> 00:17:18.900
Any chance we can
get a water break?!

314
00:17:19.033 --> 00:17:20.233
No?

315
00:17:24.033 --> 00:17:25.667
I can't thank you enough.

316
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.300
If I had the money. I'd have
you outfit the entire shop.

317
00:17:28.433 --> 00:17:31.467
If you had the money.
I would let you.

318
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.467
I do have one other small
project I'd love to discuss

319
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.834
when you have time.

320
00:17:35.967 --> 00:17:38.166
I know you have
much bigger pursuits.

321
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.967
Are you getting any closer?

322
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.900
Ah. the lighthouse?

323
00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:43.767
Bit by bit. but honestly.

324
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.967
if I don't uncover
buried treasure.

325
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.767
I think it's going to
be at least another year

326
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.233
until I have enough money.

327
00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:51.934
If you need help digging?

328
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.934
Keep at it. Your parents
would be very proud.

329
00:17:58.533 --> 00:17:59.734
Un moment.

330
00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:04.834
Ben?

331
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.233
Oh. Moriah.

332
00:18:08.367 --> 00:18:11.967
I was out for a walk
like you suggested.

333
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.834
I found this bike.

334
00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:17.000
A walk? With a helmet?

335
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.500
Yup.

336
00:18:24.133 --> 00:18:25.867
And then. there it was.

337
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.567
A sheep?

338
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.166
Yeah. it was a sheep.

339
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.200
It was like a sheep attack.

340
00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:34.533
I was cruising
along with the group.

341
00:18:34.667 --> 00:18:36.467
you know. enjoying the tour.

342
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.700
keeping up no problem.

343
00:18:37.834 --> 00:18:39.233
and a sheep. it just jumped out

344
00:18:39.367 --> 00:18:41.300
right in front of me! Bam!

345
00:18:41.433 --> 00:18:44.367
Like a stick-up?

346
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.900
Did it take your wallet?

347
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.667
You know. I could have
actually been seriously injured.

348
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.066
Mm-hm. No. it's--
it's very serious.

349
00:18:56.166 --> 00:18:57.400
It's very serious.

350
00:18:57.533 --> 00:18:59.333
because the sheep here.

351
00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:01.633
they have become quite brazen.

352
00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:04.533
We can't leave keys in our cars.

353
00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:06.900
because you turn your back
for one minute and zoom!

354
00:19:07.033 --> 00:19:08.533
They're off to the casino!

355
00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.300
Very funny.

356
00:19:14.767 --> 00:19:18.567
I'm glad you're enjoying
laughing at-- Very-- Yeah.

357
00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:25.066
I'm just so happy you are safe.

358
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.266
I have to go to
my studio for a moment.

359
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.233
but. if you want. after that
I can walk you back to the inn.

360
00:19:35.367 --> 00:19:36.734
Thank you.

361
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.367
Casino.

362
00:19:52.367 --> 00:19:54.066
Wow.

363
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.100
This is an impressive setup.

364
00:19:56.233 --> 00:19:58.233
Thank you.

365
00:19:58.367 --> 00:20:00.734
Most of those tools
are my grandfather's.

366
00:20:00.867 --> 00:20:04.533
but over the years
I've added to the collection.

367
00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:06.133
He was a carpenter by trade?

368
00:20:06.266 --> 00:20:08.967
He was. A master.

369
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.033
He always said that
working with wood was

370
00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:14.066
life's most intimate
connection with nature.

371
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.300
He was the kind of man
that if you give him a chisel

372
00:20:17.433 --> 00:20:20.400
or a piece of wood.
he could make you anything.

373
00:20:20.533 --> 00:20:23.100
Well. obviously.
you inherited his gene.

374
00:20:23.233 --> 00:20:26.734
Apparently. when I was seven.
for my birthday

375
00:20:26.867 --> 00:20:30.567
I asked for
a length of rosewood

376
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.033
so I could make
something beautiful.

377
00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:34.767
Lumber is expensive here. yeah?

378
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:37.633
Yes. if you can even get it.

379
00:20:37.767 --> 00:20:41.100
but wood has a beauty
some people are still

380
00:20:41.233 --> 00:20:42.367
willing to pay for.

381
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.767
Wow.

382
00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.600
You must have people
lined up around the block.

383
00:20:47.734 --> 00:20:50.200
Yes and no. I'm--

384
00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:54.400
I'm particular about
the projects that I choose.

385
00:20:54.533 --> 00:20:57.400
You know. I want every
piece to be meaningful.

386
00:20:57.533 --> 00:20:59.900
to speak to my heart.

387
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.166
Oh. that sounds
a little silly now that I--

388
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.500
No. no. I get it.

389
00:21:04.633 --> 00:21:06.367
I'm the same way.

390
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.800
Can I see your outdoor space?

391
00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:10.400
Uh. yes.

392
00:21:14.233 --> 00:21:17.600
Ah. From the sketches.

393
00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:19.100
For weddings.

394
00:21:19.233 --> 00:21:20.367
Mm-hm.

395
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.633
The woman who
can build anything.

396
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.533
Bonjour. Moriah!

397
00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:27.367
Bonjour. Micheline!

398
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.100
Well. I'll just go lock up
and we can walk back to the inn.

399
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.100
Ready?

400
00:21:37.233 --> 00:21:39.667
Ready as a rabbit.

401
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.600
Is that an American saying?

402
00:21:41.734 --> 00:21:43.200
No. that is something
I just came up with

403
00:21:43.333 --> 00:21:45.467
and wish I hadn't.

404
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.700
Merci.

405
00:21:52.834 --> 00:21:55.533
Ah. Moriah!

406
00:21:55.667 --> 00:21:56.834
This is my lucky day.

407
00:21:56.967 --> 00:21:58.500
Salut. Maurice!

408
00:21:58.633 --> 00:22:00.867
And who is this handsome man?

409
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.100
Don't tell me
you got married secretly

410
00:22:03.233 --> 00:22:05.066
and did not invite me
to the wedding.

411
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.200
No. and if I had been.

412
00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:08.834
surely I would have invited you.

413
00:22:08.967 --> 00:22:11.200
Maurice.

414
00:22:11.333 --> 00:22:13.033
Sometimes called
l'homme aux fleurs.

415
00:22:13.166 --> 00:22:15.000
The flower man. At your service.

416
00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:17.834
Ben McCain.
Pleasure to meet you.

417
00:22:17.967 --> 00:22:20.533
Maurice. do you know a good
place to eat around here?

418
00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:23.066
My friend. this is France.

419
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.734
There is no bad place
to eat around here.

420
00:22:25.867 --> 00:22:27.834
Now. both of you hop in.
I will take you.

421
00:22:27.967 --> 00:22:29.367
Oh. no. because I have to go--

422
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.333
Oh. you are not going
to let him eat alone?

423
00:22:34.133 --> 00:22:35.333
Surely not.

424
00:22:38.834 --> 00:22:42.800
Wow. look at that stone.
It's beautiful.

425
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.600
Um...

426
00:22:51.734 --> 00:22:53.166
Why don't you order
for the both of us?

427
00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.000
Surprise me.

428
00:22:55.133 --> 00:22:59.667
Allors. une douzen huîtres
fines de clair yves papin.

429
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.100
praires et palourdes. em...

430
00:23:03.233 --> 00:23:05.567
Oui. ça va.
Pour deux. s'il vous plaît.

431
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.367
Ah. and. to begin. um...

432
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.000
Bulots.

433
00:23:11.133 --> 00:23:12.000
Tres bien.

434
00:23:12.133 --> 00:23:13.266
Thank you. Merci.

435
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.734
Merci.

436
00:23:16.533 --> 00:23:18.500
So. is your family from here?

437
00:23:18.633 --> 00:23:22.400
Yes. as far back as we
can trace on both sides.

438
00:23:22.533 --> 00:23:25.967
My mother's family opened
the inn in the 1920s.

439
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.767
first as a boarding house.

440
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:31.166
and my father's family were
keepers of the lighthouse.

441
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.767
The lighthouse.
I saw that today on my ride.

442
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.333
Wow. you really
have stayed local.

443
00:23:36.467 --> 00:23:39.400
And this is your
first time in France?

444
00:23:39.533 --> 00:23:42.166
Oui. What gave me away?

445
00:23:43.367 --> 00:23:44.800
I like to come early.

446
00:23:44.934 --> 00:23:47.100
You know. meet the locals.

447
00:23:47.233 --> 00:23:48.767
learn things the French way.

448
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.433
Ah. and tell me.
what have you learned?

449
00:23:52.567 --> 00:23:55.800
I've learned that
everybody is very happy.

450
00:23:55.934 --> 00:24:00.066
that they really seem to
know how to enjoy themselves.

451
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.233
And the food.
The food is incredible.

452
00:24:02.367 --> 00:24:04.300
I had three
baguettes today alone.

453
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.367
Okay. Lesson number one.

454
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.834
Quality over quantity.

455
00:24:11.967 --> 00:24:15.867
Maybe one incredible
baguette enjoyed is enough?

456
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.200
And lesson number two?

457
00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:18.567
Why don't you try
lesson number one?

458
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.567
Ah.

459
00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.066
Both: Merci.

460
00:24:23.667 --> 00:24:26.000
Okay. So. what are we eating?

461
00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:27.934
Uh. les yeux du calamar.

462
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.467
Oh. calamari.

463
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.800
Yes. the eyeball.

464
00:24:31.934 --> 00:24:33.500
O-oh.

465
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.400
No. It's--

466
00:24:40.533 --> 00:24:41.867
It's sea snail.

467
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.400
Ah.

468
00:24:45.166 --> 00:24:48.700
Snails. Okay. Bon appetit.

469
00:24:48.834 --> 00:24:51.066
Bon appetit.

470
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.533
Okay.

471
00:24:52.667 --> 00:24:54.800
It's pretty stuck in there.

472
00:24:54.934 --> 00:24:56.567
Tape recording: Bonjour.

473
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.967
Bonjour.

474
00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:01.133
Tape recording: Sil te plait!

475
00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:03.133
Sil te plait!

476
00:25:03.266 --> 00:25:04.400
Tape recording: Sil te plait!

477
00:25:04.533 --> 00:25:05.800
Sil te plait!

478
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.433
Merci beaucoup.

479
00:25:31.567 --> 00:25:32.867
Bon soir.

480
00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:37.900
Bon soir. monsieur.
Voulez-vous boire quelque chose?

481
00:25:38.033 --> 00:25:39.133
Something to drink?

482
00:25:39.266 --> 00:25:40.400
Ah. yes. Um--

483
00:25:40.533 --> 00:25:42.033
Try

484
00:25:42.166 --> 00:25:44.033
If you enjoy cider.
it's very similar.

485
00:25:44.166 --> 00:25:46.934
Tart. but refreshing.

486
00:25:47.066 --> 00:25:48.767
Deux. S'il te plaît.

487
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.367
Oh. very good.

488
00:25:53.266 --> 00:25:55.767
Well. this is quite
a little slice of paradise

489
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.033
you found here.

490
00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:59.600
Yes. you're right.

491
00:25:59.734 --> 00:26:01.667
You're enjoying
your time so far?

492
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.033
Oh. yes. very much.

493
00:26:03.166 --> 00:26:04.300
In fact. I made it
into town this morning.

494
00:26:04.433 --> 00:26:05.834
I got to see Moriah's studio.

495
00:26:05.967 --> 00:26:07.367
She invited you?

496
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.633
Uh. well. not exactly.

497
00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:10.200
I had another bike incident

498
00:26:10.333 --> 00:26:12.200
Oh.

499
00:26:12.333 --> 00:26:14.166
Merci.

500
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.533
She really is something.
and her work is--

501
00:26:21.467 --> 00:26:23.300
extraordinary.

502
00:26:23.433 --> 00:26:26.133
Her father's family
were all very talented.

503
00:26:26.266 --> 00:26:28.100
Her grandfather especially.

504
00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:32.000
When Moriah's parents passed.
she stuck to him like glue.

505
00:26:32.133 --> 00:26:34.367
Oh. her parents.
I-- I had no idea.

506
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.100
It was when
she was quite little.

507
00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:41.166
Home for you is?

508
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.700
Mm. That is a good question.

509
00:26:44.834 --> 00:26:46.000
I bounce so much for work

510
00:26:46.133 --> 00:26:48.033
I'm not sure
I really know anymore.

511
00:26:48.166 --> 00:26:49.600
Is that typical
for an architect?

512
00:26:49.734 --> 00:26:52.033
Well. for the kind
of work I do. yes.

513
00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:54.767
but it's also a choice.

514
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.667
I like not knowing
what the next chapter holds.

515
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.700
A man who designs homes.

516
00:26:58.834 --> 00:27:01.433
and doesn't have
one to call his own.

517
00:27:03.166 --> 00:27:04.934
I suppose I haven't found
a place where the desire

518
00:27:05.066 --> 00:27:08.500
to stay is as strong as
the desire to move on.

519
00:27:08.633 --> 00:27:12.033
You remind me very much
of someone I used to know.

520
00:27:23.834 --> 00:27:26.934
I had a nice chat
with our American guest.

521
00:27:27.066 --> 00:27:30.000
He spoke very
highly about your work.

522
00:27:30.133 --> 00:27:32.233
and how much he enjoyed
the lunch you had together.

523
00:27:32.367 --> 00:27:33.767
I know what you're thinking.

524
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.000
I'm thinking nothing.

525
00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:37.934
but he is here
for the whole summer.

526
00:27:38.066 --> 00:27:39.233
And?

527
00:27:39.367 --> 00:27:40.867
He's quite charming

528
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
and not at all
disturbing on the eyes.

529
00:27:43.133 --> 00:27:44.367
And?

530
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.033
You both have common interests.

531
00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:47.700
An appreciation for design.

532
00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:49.367
And?

533
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.567
Perhaps. should
the occasion arise.

534
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.533
it might be not so terrible to

535
00:27:54.667 --> 00:27:56.667
get to know him a little better.

536
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.500
Okay. Tantine.

537
00:27:58.633 --> 00:28:03.333
The last thing in the world
that I'm looking for is romance.

538
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.667
That's exactly when you find it.

539
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.400
I don't date tourists!

540
00:28:09.533 --> 00:28:11.667
J'taime. Tantine. Love you.

541
00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:22.834
Tantine.

542
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.633
Is Jacques nearby?

543
00:28:25.767 --> 00:28:27.233
Oh.

544
00:28:27.367 --> 00:28:30.433
He's back around lunch.
I believe. Is it urgent?

545
00:28:30.567 --> 00:28:33.667
Uh. I'm having some pieces
of the arbor delivered today.

546
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.767
and I was hoping
he could help carry them.

547
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.834
Ah. he'll be very disappointed
to have missed the occasion.

548
00:28:39.967 --> 00:28:41.967
but perhaps someone
else could be of help?

549
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.800
Ben?

550
00:28:43.934 --> 00:28:45.734
Hi.

551
00:28:45.867 --> 00:28:49.400
Well. I think these
are the last ones.

552
00:28:49.533 --> 00:28:52.800
Can I give you a hand
putting them together?

553
00:28:52.934 --> 00:28:56.767
Uh. no. thank you.

554
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.066
Wouldn't want to ruin
your plans for the morning.

555
00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.433
I don't any plans.

556
00:28:59.567 --> 00:29:01.467
No more bicycle tours?

557
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.233
You're right. I haven't had
the best luck with bicycles

558
00:29:04.367 --> 00:29:05.834
on this trip so far.

559
00:29:05.967 --> 00:29:08.300
I was hoping to make it
one day without getting injured.

560
00:29:08.433 --> 00:29:09.667
For you. that could be tough.

561
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.467
Okay.

562
00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:14.567
Merci.

563
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:15.567
Thank you.

564
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.000
Ah. you're welcome.

565
00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.734
Quesque'il fait?

566
00:29:39.934 --> 00:29:43.567
Ben! Quesque tu fais?
What are you doing?

567
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.233
I was just going to
go out on the boat.

568
00:29:45.367 --> 00:29:47.000
- In that?
- Yeah.

569
00:29:47.133 --> 00:29:48.834
You know that's
not a boat. right?

570
00:29:48.967 --> 00:29:51.467
You take that to your boat.

571
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.066
Ah.

572
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.333
Yeah. and have you
checked the tide schedule?

573
00:29:55.467 --> 00:29:57.533
Because if you don't
time it properly

574
00:29:57.667 --> 00:30:00.567
you could be
stranded in the bay.

575
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.900
I'll be back in an hour tops.

576
00:30:03.033 --> 00:30:05.066
If you come back at all.

577
00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.467
Uh. where are you
planning to go?

578
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.734
I'd just go out in the bay.

579
00:30:09.867 --> 00:30:12.333
maybe go around. get a better
look at the lighthouse.

580
00:30:12.467 --> 00:30:14.066
Ah. le phare.

581
00:30:27.333 --> 00:30:29.333
Ben: I find architecture
is often viewed

582
00:30:29.467 --> 00:30:31.300
as a technical skill.

583
00:30:31.433 --> 00:30:33.667
but I've always
considered form to be an equal.

584
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.367
if not greater.
counterpart to function.

585
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.767
and form comes
directly from the heart.

586
00:30:41.033 --> 00:30:42.900
The lighthouse. for example.

587
00:30:43.033 --> 00:30:45.834
It exists solely for
the purpose of function.

588
00:30:45.967 --> 00:30:50.333
yet every lighthouse
is different. Why?

589
00:30:50.467 --> 00:30:54.066
Because every one carries
a piece of the designer's heart.

590
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.000
You're very. um...

591
00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:59.934
Inattendu.

592
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.600
Inattendu.

593
00:31:02.734 --> 00:31:04.133
Caught me without my translator.

594
00:31:04.266 --> 00:31:06.066
so I'm going to
assume that means

595
00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.533
"pleasant to stroll
along a path with."

596
00:31:09.667 --> 00:31:12.700
The traveling architect
whose entire life

597
00:31:12.834 --> 00:31:15.533
fits into a single bag.

598
00:31:15.667 --> 00:31:16.900
What else do you need?

599
00:31:17.033 --> 00:31:19.467
Family. You need family. no?

600
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.400
Without family we have
no history. no roots.

601
00:31:23.533 --> 00:31:26.100
We are floating on the wind.

602
00:31:26.233 --> 00:31:27.633
Doesn't sound so bad to me.

603
00:31:30.166 --> 00:31:31.533
And this is why you travel?

604
00:31:31.667 --> 00:31:33.433
I travel because
it's what I know.

605
00:31:33.567 --> 00:31:35.133
but I also love my work.

606
00:31:35.266 --> 00:31:36.567
I love creating
something out of nothing.

607
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.633
I love taking the old
and making it new.

608
00:31:39.767 --> 00:31:41.133
Ah.

609
00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:44.400
I love taking the old
and keeping it old.

610
00:31:44.533 --> 00:31:48.633
Every grain of wood.
every nail. every fleck of paint

611
00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:51.033
it has a a story to tell.

612
00:31:51.166 --> 00:31:53.567
a history. um.

613
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.300
a piece of the designer's heart.

614
00:31:59.367 --> 00:32:03.834
So. the lighthouse was rebuilt?

615
00:32:03.967 --> 00:32:08.633
Yes. in 1946 after it was
destroyed during the war.

616
00:32:08.767 --> 00:32:11.500
And you're planning
on buying it?

617
00:32:11.633 --> 00:32:13.467
The lighthouse? No.

618
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.834
In France they're owned
by the government.

619
00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:18.433
but the light keeper's
house can be purchased.

620
00:32:18.567 --> 00:32:20.834
My father's family
has lived in that house

621
00:32:20.967 --> 00:32:22.834
since the day it was built.

622
00:32:22.967 --> 00:32:27.467
One day I plan to restore
every last inch of it.

623
00:32:29.066 --> 00:32:31.467
The light keeper's house?

624
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.600
Uh. Moriah. hold up--

625
00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:40.333
Monsieur. monsieur!
C'est une propriete privee!

626
00:32:40.467 --> 00:32:41.934
It's private property!

627
00:32:42.066 --> 00:32:45.000
I know it's private property.
No need to shout.

628
00:32:45.133 --> 00:32:46.533
- Benjamin. hello.
- Nicholas. hello!

629
00:32:46.667 --> 00:32:47.533
Wait. you know this man?

630
00:32:47.667 --> 00:32:49.467
Nicholas Martin.

631
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.567
Moriah Beaufort.

632
00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:55.300
Enchantée.

633
00:32:55.433 --> 00:32:58.200
Mr. McCain is quite
the brilliant architect.

634
00:32:58.333 --> 00:33:01.066
Have you seen the design
he's dreamt up for this place?

635
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.333
Quel endroit? What place?

636
00:33:04.467 --> 00:33:06.500
This place.

637
00:33:06.633 --> 00:33:08.100
The site of my new home.

638
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.266
Moriah. I think there's been
a serious miscommunication--

639
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.900
Seems pretty
straight forward to me.

640
00:33:17.033 --> 00:33:18.333
I was hired to design a house.

641
00:33:18.467 --> 00:33:20.000
I had no idea
whose land it was on.

642
00:33:20.133 --> 00:33:21.834
You haven't been
hired to design a house.

643
00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:23.767
you've been hired
to tear one down.

644
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.700
Mine. my family's.

645
00:33:25.834 --> 00:33:27.533
I think that
if you saw my plans--

646
00:33:27.667 --> 00:33:28.867
I don't need to
look at your plans.

647
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.433
You just told me
exactly how you operate.

648
00:33:31.567 --> 00:33:33.367
Out with the old.
Is that not true?

649
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.934
With the house. yes.

650
00:33:35.066 --> 00:33:36.567
but we're not going to
touch the lighthouse.

651
00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.367
The house and the lighthouse
are one and the same.

652
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.300
How can you not see that?
How can you not--

653
00:33:43.533 --> 00:33:45.166
Why bother?

654
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.333
I know your feelings
about history.

655
00:33:47.467 --> 00:33:49.700
You're the last person
who would understand.

656
00:33:49.834 --> 00:33:51.033
Moriah!

657
00:34:03.266 --> 00:34:04.467
Did you know?

658
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.734
About what?

659
00:34:05.867 --> 00:34:07.433
About the house!

660
00:34:07.567 --> 00:34:08.967
That it's been
bought by an investor

661
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.767
and he's planning
to demolish it!

662
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.367
Slow down. Moriah.

663
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.133
I don't have a clue
what are you talking about.

664
00:34:14.266 --> 00:34:15.934
What investor? What house?

665
00:34:16.066 --> 00:34:19.600
The light keeper's house.
That's why Ben is here.

666
00:34:19.734 --> 00:34:22.433
he's been hired to
design the project.

667
00:34:22.567 --> 00:34:26.100
They're going to tear it down
and build a private residence.

668
00:34:26.233 --> 00:34:28.900
Moriah. of course I didn't know.

669
00:34:29.033 --> 00:34:31.767
But who is this investor?
This man?

670
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.200
Entre.

671
00:34:42.033 --> 00:34:43.233
Hello. Katherine.

672
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.900
Nicholas?

673
00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:48.066
Am I the only one
who doesn't know this man?

674
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.800
I'm confused.

675
00:34:49.934 --> 00:34:51.066
You bought the house?

676
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.934
It was time to come home.

677
00:34:53.066 --> 00:34:55.633
It's been 30 years.

678
00:34:55.767 --> 00:34:59.033
Without warning.
without as much as a word?

679
00:34:59.166 --> 00:35:03.433
Look. I feel badly if
I've stepped on anyone's plans.

680
00:35:03.567 --> 00:35:04.700
but I assure you--

681
00:35:04.834 --> 00:35:06.300
I think you should go.

682
00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:07.300
Katherine.

683
00:35:07.433 --> 00:35:08.800
Nicholas. Please.

684
00:35:21.734 --> 00:35:23.834
Just like that.
I've become the villain.

685
00:35:23.967 --> 00:35:25.800
I'm not sure that's true.

686
00:35:25.934 --> 00:35:27.500
Two people
chasing the same dream.

687
00:35:27.633 --> 00:35:29.633
That doesn't make you a bad guy.

688
00:35:29.767 --> 00:35:32.400
I fear it may be a little
more complicated than that.

689
00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:36.767
Both: Merci.

690
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.166
You know. this island
is very special to me.

691
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.033
I grew up here.

692
00:35:42.166 --> 00:35:44.133
I fell in love for
the first time here.

693
00:35:44.266 --> 00:35:48.533
It's the only place that's
ever truly felt like home.

694
00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:52.600
I think I wanted that
feeling again. you know?

695
00:35:52.734 --> 00:35:56.767
In the end it's never just
the place that brings you back.

696
00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.166
It's the people.

697
00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.667
Always the people.

698
00:36:08.834 --> 00:36:10.567
He had this quality.
this confidence.

699
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.066
like a movie star.

700
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.734
He was quite serious. adventurous.

701
00:36:15.867 --> 00:36:17.433
When we met
he was in the military.

702
00:36:17.567 --> 00:36:20.200
he wanted to study
medicine in America.

703
00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:22.367
He was always reading.

704
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.200
I fell for him in an instant.

705
00:36:25.333 --> 00:36:27.934
Is that why he left? To study?

706
00:36:28.066 --> 00:36:31.100
The war in the Gulf.

707
00:36:31.233 --> 00:36:34.333
France sent soldiers to
fight alongside the Americans.

708
00:36:34.467 --> 00:36:37.767
And then what? He just--
Well. he never came back?

709
00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:39.033
He never returned?

710
00:36:39.166 --> 00:36:40.533
It wasn't so simple.

711
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.934
It was just after--

712
00:36:45.467 --> 00:36:47.400
Ah.

713
00:36:47.533 --> 00:36:49.000
After my parents died.

714
00:36:49.133 --> 00:36:51.934
You were so little.

715
00:36:52.066 --> 00:36:55.100
A teeny bird with a broken wing.

716
00:36:55.233 --> 00:36:56.867
This was your home.

717
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.567
You needed to stay here to heal.

718
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.433
to feel safe and grow.

719
00:37:01.567 --> 00:37:04.934
Nicholas wanted
to see the world.

720
00:37:05.066 --> 00:37:07.000
but he was a good man.

721
00:37:07.133 --> 00:37:08.767
If he'd known the truth.
he would have returned

722
00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.400
to make a life with me.

723
00:37:10.533 --> 00:37:13.567
I believed in my heart
he would wake up one day

724
00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.400
and resent me for it.

725
00:37:15.533 --> 00:37:18.100
So. you gave him up for me?

726
00:37:18.233 --> 00:37:20.300
No. my darling.

727
00:37:20.433 --> 00:37:23.266
You were my greatest gift.

728
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.867
I gave him up for him.

729
00:37:32.567 --> 00:37:35.266
I'm so sorry for
your lighthouse.

730
00:37:41.567 --> 00:37:43.900
Mr. McCain.
a pleasant evening I hope?

731
00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:45.533
Not the best. actually.

732
00:38:01.633 --> 00:38:03.166
Ah. bonjour. Maurice!

733
00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:16.834
Bonjour. again.

734
00:38:16.967 --> 00:38:19.533
Ah. I was wondering
if I could try--

735
00:38:19.667 --> 00:38:21.367
Épuisé. Sold.

736
00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.200
Sold? Sold out?

737
00:38:24.333 --> 00:38:25.967
Épuisé. Désolé pour ça.

738
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.300
Okay.

739
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.166
Brigitte: Is there any hope?

740
00:38:40.533 --> 00:38:41.667
I don't know what we can do.

741
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.834
Bonjour.

742
00:38:42.967 --> 00:38:44.533
I should be getting back.

743
00:38:44.667 --> 00:38:46.133
Good day.

744
00:38:47.934 --> 00:38:49.667
Hello.

745
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.667
May I...

746
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.266
Mm. Yes. of course.

747
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.700
Look. I feel terrible
about how things went down.

748
00:38:58.834 --> 00:39:02.233
I did not set out
to ruin people's lives.

749
00:39:02.367 --> 00:39:04.400
Suddenly I feel like
public enemy number one.

750
00:39:04.533 --> 00:39:08.700
You have to understand.
the people in this town.

751
00:39:08.834 --> 00:39:09.967
we're family.

752
00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.800
Lesson number two.

753
00:39:11.934 --> 00:39:15.233
The people in
your life are everything.

754
00:39:15.367 --> 00:39:18.000
And when one of us hurts.
we all do.

755
00:39:44.367 --> 00:39:46.633
I thought maybe
I would find you here.

756
00:39:48.266 --> 00:39:49.400
You're not planning on
bashing me over the head

757
00:39:49.533 --> 00:39:50.633
with that are you?

758
00:39:50.767 --> 00:39:53.734
And waste good cider?

759
00:39:53.867 --> 00:39:55.567
No. I would drink it first.

760
00:40:01.433 --> 00:40:03.000
Merci.

761
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.533
About lesson number two. um...

762
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.467
You were unfairly thrust
into the middle of all of this

763
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.233
and I know you were
just doing your job.

764
00:40:22.533 --> 00:40:24.400
It definitely wasn't personal.

765
00:40:24.533 --> 00:40:27.000
These things are always
personal to someone.

766
00:40:28.667 --> 00:40:32.333
But it's not fair for
you to shoulder the blame.

767
00:40:34.333 --> 00:40:38.433
You're right. I don't know you.

768
00:40:38.567 --> 00:40:41.900
and if I characterized
you unfairly...

769
00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.834
Suis desole. I'm sorry.

770
00:40:48.934 --> 00:40:51.867
Well. if you're interested.

771
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.033
Maybe you can show me through
your eyes.

772
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.000
From the day of its completion.

773
00:41:10.133 --> 00:41:13.433
my father's family.
the Beauforts.

774
00:41:13.567 --> 00:41:16.400
were the sole keepers
of the lighthouse.

775
00:41:19.734 --> 00:41:21.900
During both World Wars.

776
00:41:22.033 --> 00:41:25.100
while the men were off fighting.

777
00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:27.500
the women. they stood by it

778
00:41:27.633 --> 00:41:29.500
to make sure
the light stayed on.

779
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.066
My father was
raised in this house.

780
00:41:34.633 --> 00:41:36.300
Why was it sold off?

781
00:41:36.433 --> 00:41:39.233
My family never owned it.

782
00:41:39.367 --> 00:41:42.834
The residence was afforded
to the lighthouse keeper

783
00:41:42.967 --> 00:41:45.000
for the term of their service.

784
00:41:45.133 --> 00:41:48.667
but the property always
belonged to the government.

785
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.467
Once it was decommissioned

786
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.066
it became my father's dream to

787
00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.633
one save enough money
to buy it. but...

788
00:42:07.834 --> 00:42:11.700
I'm sure your plans
are very nice.

789
00:42:11.834 --> 00:42:13.700
but this property tells
the story of my family

790
00:42:13.834 --> 00:42:15.567
for generations.

791
00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.066
My father was born here.

792
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.900
If it's torn down. I--

793
00:42:24.934 --> 00:42:26.567
It's all I have left of them.

794
00:42:38.367 --> 00:42:39.767
Katherine.

795
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.867
Nicholas. please.

796
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.834
I don't know what
your hope is. but--

797
00:42:45.967 --> 00:42:47.233
My hope is nothing.

798
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.600
This is my home.
I've always planned to return.

799
00:42:56.433 --> 00:42:58.233
My intention was not
to reopen old wounds.

800
00:42:58.367 --> 00:42:59.667
And yet here you are.

801
00:43:03.567 --> 00:43:06.767
Why didn't you tell me about
Moriah all those years ago?

802
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:11.567
You just stopped responding.
silence. like I was nothing.

803
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:13.800
I would have come back.

804
00:43:13.934 --> 00:43:15.900
And then what?

805
00:43:16.033 --> 00:43:18.133
I knew what you wanted.

806
00:43:18.266 --> 00:43:21.734
You would have lasted a year
before getting restless.

807
00:43:21.867 --> 00:43:24.734
You had big dreams
you wanted to pursue.

808
00:43:24.867 --> 00:43:25.967
But I didn't get to.

809
00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.033
I didn't get to pursue them.

810
00:43:28.166 --> 00:43:30.734
because all those
dreams included you.

811
00:43:33.734 --> 00:43:36.300
The torment you put me through.

812
00:43:36.433 --> 00:43:38.300
wondering where I went wrong.

813
00:43:40.433 --> 00:43:42.066
If you had fallen
in love with someone else.

814
00:43:46.867 --> 00:43:48.400
I'm sorry.

815
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.900
Nicholas!

816
00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:56.066
Benjamin!

817
00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.200
I was hoping to find you.

818
00:43:57.333 --> 00:43:58.233
And I you.

819
00:43:58.367 --> 00:43:59.600
I had a thought.

820
00:43:59.734 --> 00:44:00.934
As did I!

821
00:44:01.066 --> 00:44:02.266
Does it involve the lighthouse?

822
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.867
It involves a woman.

823
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.867
Oh. um...

824
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.166
Should we walk and talk?

825
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.300
We should probably
sit and drink.

826
00:44:10.433 --> 00:44:11.800
Come on.

827
00:44:13.166 --> 00:44:14.033
So. tell me.

828
00:44:14.166 --> 00:44:15.033
Uh. you go first.

829
00:44:15.166 --> 00:44:16.767
And then what?

830
00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.266
And then I rushed away.

831
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.100
I didn't know what to say.

832
00:44:20.233 --> 00:44:21.767
Okay.

833
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.200
I'm telling you. because...

834
00:44:24.333 --> 00:44:26.934
...maybe I'm supposed
to feel angry at him

835
00:44:27.066 --> 00:44:30.734
about the lighthouse.
but what I'm really feeling...

836
00:44:32.433 --> 00:44:33.533
...is more complicated.

837
00:44:33.667 --> 00:44:35.233
Ah.

838
00:44:37.934 --> 00:44:41.834
It's taken me a lifetime
to realize that things rarely

839
00:44:41.967 --> 00:44:43.767
work out as planned. but...

840
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:47.967
...we can choose
how to move forward.

841
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.467
We can still shape the pages.

842
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.033
even if we didn't
write the narrative.

843
00:44:54.166 --> 00:44:58.133
I've been angry at
the world for a long time.

844
00:44:58.266 --> 00:44:59.467
About a lot of things.

845
00:45:01.633 --> 00:45:03.367
I don't want to
be angry anymore.

846
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.433
Moriah?

847
00:45:27.467 --> 00:45:28.567
I don't need a translator
to know that those are not

848
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:30.166
words of encouragement.

849
00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.934
It's the. you know.
the vintage flathead screws.

850
00:45:34.066 --> 00:45:35.667
It won't go in the hinge.

851
00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.500
May I?

852
00:45:40.567 --> 00:45:43.533
I'll just hold it.

853
00:45:54.667 --> 00:45:56.533
Merci. So.

854
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.266
You know. there are
a lot of stubborn ones.

855
00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.367
It's the stubborn ones
that make life interesting.

856
00:46:07.533 --> 00:46:09.767
I talked to Nicholas today.

857
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.834
His intention was
to only ever live in

858
00:46:11.967 --> 00:46:13.567
the place he loves the most.

859
00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.400
surrounded by the people
he loves the most.

860
00:46:17.433 --> 00:46:18.734
He wants to keep the house.

861
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.300
To restore it.

862
00:46:22.433 --> 00:46:26.567
But he wants you to
oversee the project.

863
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.800
Me?

864
00:46:27.934 --> 00:46:30.000
You. You have the skill

865
00:46:30.133 --> 00:46:31.266
and you're the only
person who will make sure

866
00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.066
that it is done properly.

867
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.433
but we have to start in a week.

868
00:46:37.133 --> 00:46:39.767
No. No. way.

869
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.333
I don't think that I can--

870
00:46:41.467 --> 00:46:44.633
Moriah. I understand
that this is disappointing.

871
00:46:44.767 --> 00:46:46.967
it's not what
I had in mind either.

872
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.467
I spent a year
working on those plans

873
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.633
and. frankly.
I'm pretty proud of them.

874
00:46:50.767 --> 00:46:53.066
but you know and I know
that leveling that house

875
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.767
is not the right thing to do.

876
00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.800
We have an opportunity to
turn your vision into a reality.

877
00:46:57.934 --> 00:46:59.500
So. don't--

878
00:47:01.166 --> 00:47:04.000
Don't so it for me.
don't do it for Nicholas.

879
00:47:04.133 --> 00:47:05.233
Do it for yourself.

880
00:47:05.367 --> 00:47:08.300
If you say no. I understand.

881
00:47:08.433 --> 00:47:12.400
But. please.
we could use your help.

882
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.500
Okay.

883
00:47:19.633 --> 00:47:20.800
For me.

884
00:47:20.934 --> 00:47:22.800
I'll do it for me.

885
00:47:22.934 --> 00:47:24.567
Great.

886
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:27.333
I'll start making preparations.

887
00:47:33.767 --> 00:47:36.066
As some of you already know.

888
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.000
this is a monumental
moment for me.

889
00:47:39.133 --> 00:47:43.867
and I'm so honored to be
working alongside each of you.

890
00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.734
Above all.
the aim is to preserve.

891
00:47:47.867 --> 00:47:51.867
Please. let's be surgical in
our approach whenever possible.

892
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
I ask that you use
the same care that you would

893
00:47:55.133 --> 00:47:57.333
if this was your home.

894
00:47:57.467 --> 00:47:59.900
And also have fun please.

895
00:48:05.734 --> 00:48:07.133
What?

896
00:48:07.266 --> 00:48:09.767
Nothing.

897
00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:11.066
Let's see what
we're dealing with.

898
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.166
Oui.

899
00:48:15.734 --> 00:48:17.433
Well. it smells
like a locker room.

900
00:48:17.567 --> 00:48:20.700
Oh. it's just musk.
Don't breath it in.

901
00:48:20.834 --> 00:48:23.300
Well. I'm smelling it. so that
would suggest I'm breathing it.

902
00:48:23.433 --> 00:48:24.967
Well. um. stop breathing.

903
00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.233
Ah. you'd miss me way too much.

904
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.967
You know it's in remarkably
good shape considering the age.

905
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.033
That tapered casement
around the flue.

906
00:48:36.166 --> 00:48:37.433
it's a work of art.

907
00:48:37.567 --> 00:48:40.633
Oui. My grandfather.
he did all the millwork.

908
00:48:40.767 --> 00:48:45.533
The casing. the moldings.
the. uh. corbels here.

909
00:48:52.033 --> 00:48:53.800
Was there water damage
in here at some point?

910
00:48:53.934 --> 00:48:56.066
It's possible.

911
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.700
Looks like the molding
around the window is

912
00:48:57.834 --> 00:48:59.700
rotted out at the bottom.

913
00:48:59.834 --> 00:49:01.467
Do you think you could
mill some new stuff?

914
00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:03.767
It's a big job.

915
00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.800
We could always
blow this window out

916
00:49:05.934 --> 00:49:07.500
and put in a double-glazed
casement window.

917
00:49:07.633 --> 00:49:10.467
I'll throw you through
a double-glazed casement window.

918
00:49:20.233 --> 00:49:22.667
Ah. oui. Super.

919
00:49:25.033 --> 00:49:29.600
Ben: Moriah!
I think I found something!

920
00:49:29.734 --> 00:49:31.000
What?

921
00:49:31.133 --> 00:49:34.000
Looks like there's
an opening back there.

922
00:49:34.133 --> 00:49:35.533
What?

923
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.166
What in the world?

924
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.667
Yeah. I tried to move it.
but it's-- it's not budging.

925
00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.567
Did you get in a lot of fights
as a kid?

926
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.467
No. the other children
were afraid of me.

927
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.166
Shall we?

928
00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.767
What's this?

929
00:50:50.934 --> 00:50:52.333
They are old letters.

930
00:51:10.767 --> 00:51:12.133
Oh.

931
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.567
Katherine.

932
00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.166
I recall how much
you loved to cook.

933
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:25.200
So. I brought you these.
fresh from the market.

934
00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:27.000
Thank you.

935
00:51:27.133 --> 00:51:28.567
I haven't thanked you yet

936
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.500
for altering your plans
with the lighthouse.

937
00:51:31.633 --> 00:51:35.300
It means so much
to Moriah and to me.

938
00:51:35.433 --> 00:51:36.633
To everybody.

939
00:51:38.867 --> 00:51:41.300
Seeing as we're going to be
neighbors. I wanted to extend

940
00:51:41.433 --> 00:51:44.867
an olive branch. So. now I did.

941
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.233
Thank you.

942
00:51:46.367 --> 00:51:49.200
You know.
it's really thoughtful.

943
00:51:49.333 --> 00:51:51.367
but the whole
joy of cooking is in

944
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.467
having someone to share it with.

945
00:51:57.133 --> 00:52:00.133
There were always whispers of
my family sheltering allies

946
00:52:00.266 --> 00:52:01.633
during the war. but this is...

947
00:52:01.767 --> 00:52:03.066
Well. look at these dates.

948
00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.266
1943. 44.

949
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.700
So during the war.

950
00:52:06.834 --> 00:52:11.100
Yes. and they're
all love letters.

951
00:52:11.233 --> 00:52:13.800
all written in the same hand.

952
00:52:13.934 --> 00:52:18.033
My love. my love. mon trésor.

953
00:52:18.166 --> 00:52:22.300
my darling JP. mon chér JP.

954
00:52:24.066 --> 00:52:27.066
"Mon chér. JP.
I think of you often.

955
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.700
I long for
your breath on my cheek.

956
00:52:29.834 --> 00:52:32.100
I will write again
when it is safe.

957
00:52:32.233 --> 00:52:34.533
Tout mon amour. All my love."

958
00:52:34.667 --> 00:52:36.467
It's signed. A.

959
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:40.266
So. this JP must have also
sheltered there for a time.

960
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.133
Oui.

961
00:52:42.266 --> 00:52:44.967
Imagine falling so madly in love

962
00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.767
and then being torn apart.

963
00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.066
Never knowing when
the next letter will arrive

964
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.567
or where the person even is.

965
00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:53.200
It's unbearable.

966
00:52:53.333 --> 00:52:58.033
And spending months on end
alone in that tiny room.

967
00:52:58.166 --> 00:53:00.700
alone with your thoughts.
your worry.

968
00:53:00.834 --> 00:53:04.867
It makes you appreciate all
the things we take for granted.

969
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.934
I would really like to share
these letters with Katherine.

970
00:53:08.066 --> 00:53:09.166
would you like to--

971
00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.667
Oh. oui. Yes. I'd love to.

972
00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.400
Okay.

973
00:53:19.166 --> 00:53:21.767
Oh. Moriah!

974
00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.433
I lost track of time.

975
00:53:24.567 --> 00:53:27.467
I invited Nicholas to
use the kitchen and--

976
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.500
And I made enough
to feed the entire town.

977
00:53:30.633 --> 00:53:34.000
Why don't you stay?
A meal is meant to be shared.

978
00:53:34.133 --> 00:53:36.834
Okay. Oui. merci.
It looks very nice.

979
00:53:36.967 --> 00:53:38.333
Both: Thank you.

980
00:53:38.467 --> 00:53:41.333
Filet de morue aux
petits légumes de saison.

981
00:53:41.467 --> 00:53:43.033
A famous local dish.

982
00:53:43.166 --> 00:53:45.166
Nicholas does it magnificently.

983
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:47.600
And I found these
beautiful vegetables

984
00:53:47.734 --> 00:53:49.200
at the farmers market.

985
00:53:49.333 --> 00:53:52.300
So. why don't you help us
to dress the table?

986
00:53:52.433 --> 00:53:55.467
Of course. I'm impressed
you made this all from scratch.

987
00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.100
Meal is serious
business around here.

988
00:53:58.233 --> 00:54:01.567
and preparation is
half of the joy.

989
00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.367
Lesson number three.

990
00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:05.166
A meal is meant to be savored.

991
00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.333
Always make time
to sit and enjoy.

992
00:54:07.467 --> 00:54:09.667
Never walk and eat. Ever.

993
00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.000
Especially if a mad
Frenchwoman is barreling

994
00:54:12.133 --> 00:54:14.500
towards you on a bicycle.

995
00:54:14.633 --> 00:54:16.834
I noticed
the scaffolding up today.

996
00:54:16.967 --> 00:54:19.000
You seem to be
making good headway.

997
00:54:19.133 --> 00:54:21.100
Yes. Moriah was
born to lead this team.

998
00:54:21.233 --> 00:54:23.367
Ah. but without Ben.
there wouldn't be a team

999
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.600
for me to lead.

1000
00:54:24.734 --> 00:54:27.033
Well. then. all is well?

1001
00:54:27.166 --> 00:54:30.900
Oui. only. um--
Well. there is one thing.

1002
00:54:31.033 --> 00:54:33.567
We think that
Moriah's grandparents

1003
00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.767
might have been part
of the French Resistance.

1004
00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:38.266
We found a secret room in
the basement where we think

1005
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.166
they could have
harbored Allies.

1006
00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:44.000
Oui. there was personal effects
and there were love letters.

1007
00:54:44.133 --> 00:54:46.734
They were written to a man. JP.

1008
00:54:46.867 --> 00:54:49.500
étranger. a stranger.

1009
00:54:49.633 --> 00:54:52.834
We think that they
sheltered him during the war.

1010
00:54:52.967 --> 00:54:56.767
You only know
your grandfather as Rene.

1011
00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.867
but while he was young
he preferred to be called

1012
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.900
by his middle name. Jean-Paul.

1013
00:55:01.033 --> 00:55:04.433
If I recall.
he and your grandmother

1014
00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:07.667
didn't marry until
the end of the war.

1015
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.600
So these letters
would likely be--

1016
00:55:10.734 --> 00:55:13.300
Before they met.

1017
00:55:13.433 --> 00:55:17.600
So. he kept this woman
a secret his entire life?

1018
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:24.934
Oh. so it was she
who was hiding out.

1019
00:55:25.066 --> 00:55:26.467
this Adrienne woman.

1020
00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.000
Mm-hm.

1021
00:55:28.133 --> 00:55:31.000
So. if her family really
did work with the Allies.

1022
00:55:31.133 --> 00:55:33.500
they probably sent
her away to hide her.

1023
00:55:33.633 --> 00:55:35.433
You know. it's like
something out a movie.

1024
00:55:35.567 --> 00:55:38.333
A beautiful French girl
meets a handsome stranger.

1025
00:55:38.467 --> 00:55:40.166
How do you know
she was beautiful?

1026
00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:41.834
Well. she's French.

1027
00:55:44.367 --> 00:55:46.567
Do you not have something
you need to be doing?

1028
00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:50.166
Yeah. I'm working on the kitchen
and I'm waiting for you to

1029
00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.967
finish so we can go
on a walk and discuss.

1030
00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.233
So. are you finished?

1031
00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.000
Okay.

1032
00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.900
Ben: You're not being practical.

1033
00:56:05.033 --> 00:56:06.834
And you're not
honoring the spirit of

1034
00:56:06.967 --> 00:56:08.533
what we're trying
to accomplish here.

1035
00:56:08.667 --> 00:56:11.867
The spirit only works if you're
not ignoring practicality.

1036
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.834
What good is a kitchen
if it's not functional?

1037
00:56:13.967 --> 00:56:17.200
What good is a practical
if it ignores historical intent?

1038
00:56:17.333 --> 00:56:19.033
You haven't even
looked at my plans.

1039
00:56:19.166 --> 00:56:21.734
I don't need to look at
your plans to know that--

1040
00:56:21.867 --> 00:56:23.400
What? What are you looking at?

1041
00:56:23.533 --> 00:56:24.967
What are you doing?

1042
00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.734
We're stopping for coffee.
which is both practical

1043
00:56:26.867 --> 00:56:28.834
and in the spirt of what
we're trying to accomplish.

1044
00:56:28.967 --> 00:56:30.400
No. Ben. we are right
in the middle of--

1045
00:56:30.533 --> 00:56:31.834
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

1046
00:56:31.967 --> 00:56:33.800
Lesson number three.

1047
00:56:33.934 --> 00:56:36.734
Allow time for a meal each day.

1048
00:56:36.867 --> 00:56:38.300
And since I haven't
had breakfast. so.

1049
00:56:41.633 --> 00:56:43.333
So. the countertop
would be pink granite.

1050
00:56:43.467 --> 00:56:45.000
like the stone
in the lighthouse.

1051
00:56:45.133 --> 00:56:46.633
Mm-hm.

1052
00:56:46.767 --> 00:56:48.467
I found a fabricator in
Auray that can make it for us.

1053
00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.200
and then the upper cabinets
would have leaded glass in it

1054
00:56:51.333 --> 00:56:53.600
so that it matches
with the exterior doors.

1055
00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:59.333
The care you've taken.
the attention to detail.

1056
00:56:59.467 --> 00:57:01.900
it's really wonderful.

1057
00:57:02.033 --> 00:57:04.467
No. it's-- it's perfect.

1058
00:57:06.266 --> 00:57:07.667
Thank you.

1059
00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:13.266
Never in a million years
did I imagine this.

1060
00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.100
The French builder
and the American architect.

1061
00:57:16.233 --> 00:57:18.266
Makes for a good story.

1062
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.367
Mm.

1063
00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.767
Uh. speaking of which.

1064
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.800
I have a confession.

1065
00:57:25.934 --> 00:57:27.734
I read ahead.

1066
00:57:27.867 --> 00:57:29.066
The letters?! You didn't!

1067
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:30.767
I'm sorry! I had to!

1068
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:33.233
Et tu. Brute.

1069
00:57:33.367 --> 00:57:34.800
Betrayal on the deepest level.

1070
00:57:34.934 --> 00:57:36.967
Okay. okay. but can I tell you?

1071
00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.600
Yes. please.

1072
00:57:44.266 --> 00:57:46.900
Your grandfather sounds like
quite the renaissance man.

1073
00:57:47.033 --> 00:57:49.266
The way she describes
him painting her.

1074
00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:51.266
Oh. by the light of the moon.

1075
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.734
It's incredibly romantic.

1076
00:57:53.867 --> 00:57:55.934
Maybe I should be
taking some notes.

1077
00:57:56.066 --> 00:57:58.900
I didn't even know he painted.

1078
00:57:59.033 --> 00:58:00.867
I don't think anyone did.

1079
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.266
He. um-- He had
this whole entire life

1080
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.066
before he met my grandmother.

1081
00:58:09.767 --> 00:58:10.967
Wh-what?

1082
00:58:13.567 --> 00:58:15.333
Just the way you look right now.

1083
00:58:15.467 --> 00:58:17.133
Katherine: Bonjour!

1084
00:58:17.266 --> 00:58:18.367
Bonjour.

1085
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:21.133
How wonderful it looks!

1086
00:58:21.266 --> 00:58:22.367
We come bearing gifts.

1087
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.133
Ah. merci.

1088
00:58:24.266 --> 00:58:26.533
You've been working so hard
we thought perhaps you could

1089
00:58:26.667 --> 00:58:27.967
use a little break.

1090
00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:31.867
Merci. thank you.
it's very thoughtful.

1091
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.633
I won't ask for
a tour before it's complete.

1092
00:58:33.767 --> 00:58:36.033
but from here it looks as
beautiful as I imagine it did

1093
00:58:36.166 --> 00:58:37.300
when it was built.

1094
00:58:37.433 --> 00:58:39.266
Oh. it's probably better.

1095
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.834
thanks to
the leadership of Moriah.

1096
00:58:41.967 --> 00:58:45.467
Moriah. you have taught
me a very valuable lesson

1097
00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:49.500
on the importance of fighting
for things that matter most.

1098
00:58:49.633 --> 00:58:52.033
I owe you
a lifetime of gratitude.

1099
00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:56.500
Well. we won't
take up your time.

1100
00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:58.700
Nicholas is taking me to dinner.

1101
00:58:58.834 --> 00:59:01.433
Ah. bon dîner.

1102
00:59:01.567 --> 00:59:03.200
Thank you again. Have fun.

1103
00:59:03.333 --> 00:59:05.567
Both: Merci. Au revoir.

1104
00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:22.500
What?

1105
00:59:22.633 --> 00:59:24.567
She's going to Paris.

1106
00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.066
To join the Resistance?

1107
00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:27.300
No. for Fashion Week.

1108
00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.400
Yes. to join the fight.

1109
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.633
Listen. Come. come.

1110
00:59:34.767 --> 00:59:36.533
Um. she says. uh...

1111
00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:40.166
"I know not how
long I will be gone.

1112
00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:42.900
but I will send word
as soon as I return.

1113
00:59:44.934 --> 00:59:48.767
Beyond my bedroom window there
is a rock shaped like a jewel.

1114
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:50.900
and..."

1115
00:59:52.867 --> 00:59:56.767
"...one day we will
stand arm in arm

1116
00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.667
beside that rock and be married.

1117
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.066
Until then. you are my heart.

1118
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.333
my soul. my breath.

1119
01:00:05.467 --> 01:00:07.467
Be well. my love.

1120
01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.300
We will be together again soon."

1121
01:00:10.433 --> 01:00:12.300
That's it? That's the last one?

1122
01:00:12.433 --> 01:00:15.500
That's it.
That's the last letter.

1123
01:00:15.633 --> 01:00:17.100
Well. I mean. it can't be.

1124
01:00:17.233 --> 01:00:18.633
We don't know
what happened in Paris.

1125
01:00:18.767 --> 01:00:20.333
We don't even know
if she made it back here.

1126
01:00:20.467 --> 01:00:23.934
I know my grandfather never
married a woman by a rock

1127
01:00:24.066 --> 01:00:25.533
shaped like a jewel.

1128
01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.967
I know that rock.

1129
01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:31.767
It's on the other
side of the island.

1130
01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.166
My grandfather took me
there when I was young.

1131
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.467
Incroyable.

1132
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.133
You know. it's incredible
that Nicholas and Katherine

1133
01:00:42.266 --> 01:00:44.333
found each other 30 years later.

1134
01:00:45.734 --> 01:00:47.934
Oui. To. uh--

1135
01:00:48.066 --> 01:00:50.467
To find love once
is lucky enough.

1136
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.667
but to lose it
and find it again?

1137
01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.500
It's almost impossible.

1138
01:00:55.633 --> 01:00:57.667
What about you?
Have you ever been in love?

1139
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.900
Uh...

1140
01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:03.166
Oh. I'm sorry.
You don't have to answer that.

1141
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:04.633
No. No. it's okay.

1142
01:01:04.767 --> 01:01:07.133
I just--

1143
01:01:07.266 --> 01:01:09.867
I'm a little embarrassed.

1144
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.033
I mean. here I am. I'm a woman
who is born in the birthplace

1145
01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:16.166
of romance and have
never been in love herself.

1146
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.300
It's a little--

1147
01:01:18.433 --> 01:01:20.233
I'm a little against the grain.

1148
01:01:22.166 --> 01:01:25.567
I'm not sure men
know what to make of me.

1149
01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.900
I don't know if it's
my work that keeps love away

1150
01:01:29.033 --> 01:01:32.033
or if it's me.

1151
01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:34.967
Well. it's definitely
not the work.

1152
01:01:37.033 --> 01:01:39.133
If I'm being honest. I...

1153
01:01:39.266 --> 01:01:40.667
I don't think it's either.

1154
01:01:46.533 --> 01:01:47.800
And you?

1155
01:01:47.934 --> 01:01:51.000
Uh. there was
someone for a time.

1156
01:01:51.133 --> 01:01:54.367
and does it count
as love if the other person

1157
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.133
doesn't feel the same way?

1158
01:01:56.266 --> 01:01:58.734
I'm not sure.

1159
01:01:58.867 --> 01:02:01.500
It's probably why
I move around so much.

1160
01:02:02.934 --> 01:02:05.400
Gone before things
get too complicated.

1161
01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.633
So. maybe it's my work
that keeps love away

1162
01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:12.400
or it's me.

1163
01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:19.367
Aren't we just
the most depressing pair?

1164
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.867
No. really.

1165
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.533
I mean. here we are.
surrounded by all these

1166
01:02:23.667 --> 01:02:25.533
beautiful love stories--

1167
01:02:25.667 --> 01:02:27.133
- No. no. no. no. no.
- And we're totally--

1168
01:02:27.266 --> 01:02:29.100
Do not say it.
It is too pathetic.

1169
01:02:29.233 --> 01:02:31.033
It's just way too pathetic!

1170
01:02:31.166 --> 01:02:33.233
I'm sorry.

1171
01:02:33.367 --> 01:02:34.700
Actually. I don't know
why we're laughing.

1172
01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.400
I don't know why
we're laughing either.

1173
01:02:58.266 --> 01:03:00.767
Katherine. you're looking
very fashionable today.

1174
01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.100
Thank you. Jacques.
I've been invited to go sailing.

1175
01:03:03.233 --> 01:03:04.333
Wow.

1176
01:03:04.467 --> 01:03:06.166
Are you fine for the afternoon?

1177
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:07.600
Yeah. Perfectly.

1178
01:03:07.734 --> 01:03:10.200
Moriah hasn't been
around much lately.

1179
01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:13.667
She's. uh. alright?

1180
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.934
She's happy?

1181
01:03:15.066 --> 01:03:16.533
Very much so.

1182
01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.000
Shall we?

1183
01:03:22.133 --> 01:03:23.533
Of course.

1184
01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:26.433
Bye!

1185
01:03:26.567 --> 01:03:27.900
Bye.

1186
01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:58.433
Ah. perfect.
Did you remember to--

1187
01:03:58.567 --> 01:04:01.000
Oh. Katherine!
I thought you were--

1188
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.900
No!

1189
01:04:05.033 --> 01:04:05.900
Did he...

1190
01:04:06.033 --> 01:04:07.200
On the sailboat.

1191
01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.200
Tantine. I couldn't
be happier for you.

1192
01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:14.433
When is the wedding?

1193
01:04:14.567 --> 01:04:15.867
As soon as humanly possible.

1194
01:04:25.367 --> 01:04:29.367
Hey. I want to
show you something.

1195
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.667
Come on. come on.
come on. come on. Here. Come.

1196
01:04:33.633 --> 01:04:35.266
Further. Come on.

1197
01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.600
And stop.

1198
01:04:38.734 --> 01:04:40.333
Turn around.

1199
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.633
Look what you've accomplished.

1200
01:04:44.867 --> 01:04:47.166
You did it.

1201
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.667
Um.

1202
01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.600
Vous avez réussi l'impossible

1203
01:04:55.734 --> 01:04:58.200
et vous devriez en être

1204
01:04:58.333 --> 01:05:01.600
incroyablement fier du

1205
01:05:01.734 --> 01:05:03.500
ton nez.

1206
01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:06.433
Yes. I'm very proud of my nose.

1207
01:05:06.567 --> 01:05:08.166
Oh. uh.

1208
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:12.266
Well. you did it!

1209
01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.700
The truth is. it's you
who made this possible.

1210
01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.000
You're so talented.

1211
01:05:19.133 --> 01:05:20.667
You work hard.

1212
01:05:22.133 --> 01:05:24.100
And often you're sort
of fun to be around

1213
01:05:24.233 --> 01:05:27.667
and. um--
and. um. you make me smile.

1214
01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.900
I've enjoyed these
past few months very much.

1215
01:05:33.867 --> 01:05:35.166
Yeah. Me. too.

1216
01:05:40.266 --> 01:05:41.734
Get your things. I. uh--

1217
01:05:41.867 --> 01:05:43.000
I'm going to take you
on a little adventure.

1218
01:05:43.133 --> 01:05:44.667
Come on. come on.

1219
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.767
Okay!

1220
01:05:50.734 --> 01:05:53.266
This is it.

1221
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.300
I don't even remember
where we were driving to.

1222
01:05:56.433 --> 01:05:57.800
just that it was Grandad and I.

1223
01:05:57.934 --> 01:06:00.467
and I don't know. we passed by

1224
01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.000
and he pulled the car over.

1225
01:06:02.133 --> 01:06:06.967
We got out and we stood
in this very spot.

1226
01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.000
And when I had asked him
why he had stopped the car.

1227
01:06:09.133 --> 01:06:11.500
he just looked at me
and he smiled and he said.

1228
01:06:11.633 --> 01:06:15.667
"This rock. It looks like
a jewel. n'est pas?"

1229
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.000
And that was it.

1230
01:06:18.533 --> 01:06:20.333
He just stood there
for a few minutes

1231
01:06:20.467 --> 01:06:22.867
and then we left.

1232
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.300
We never spoke of it again.

1233
01:06:29.633 --> 01:06:31.633
That must the window.

1234
01:06:31.767 --> 01:06:35.033
Ah. yes. The one she talks
about in the letter.

1235
01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:36.467
Let's see if anybody's home.

1236
01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.300
Moriah: Bonjour.

1237
01:06:57.433 --> 01:06:58.533
Bonjour.

1238
01:06:58.667 --> 01:07:00.066
Bonjour?

1239
01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.467
I have lived my whole
life in this house.

1240
01:07:05.066 --> 01:07:08.066
I have known
nothing about this.

1241
01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.767
It's heartbreaking.

1242
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.200
Did you ever know her well?
Your aunt?

1243
01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:15.800
I was born
after she left for Paris.

1244
01:07:15.934 --> 01:07:19.300
My mother was much
younger than Adrienne

1245
01:07:19.433 --> 01:07:22.767
and would not have known
much of her romantic life.

1246
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:27.367
but she remembered those
months when Adrienne was away.

1247
01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.400
She talked of it often.

1248
01:07:29.533 --> 01:07:31.734
Did your aunt ever
make it back from Paris?

1249
01:07:31.867 --> 01:07:33.300
No.

1250
01:07:33.433 --> 01:07:34.967
Many at that time did not.

1251
01:07:36.533 --> 01:07:39.867
But she was quite
celebrated for her bravery.

1252
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.200
She died a hero.

1253
01:07:45.033 --> 01:07:48.467
Is there any chance that
you have a photograph of her?

1254
01:07:50.367 --> 01:07:53.867
Sadly. all that remains

1255
01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.166
are the few belongings
she had with her when she died.

1256
01:08:06.066 --> 01:08:07.567
One love lost.

1257
01:08:09.133 --> 01:08:12.266
One lost and found
30 years later.

1258
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:15.433
The heart is
a wonderful mystery.

1259
01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.600
Powerful enough
to move mountains.

1260
01:08:19.734 --> 01:08:23.433
delicate enough to shatter
at the slightest touch.

1261
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.600
But if we don't

1262
01:08:27.734 --> 01:08:29.834
love without restraint.

1263
01:08:29.967 --> 01:08:34.367
we risk missing out the greatest
gift life has to offer.

1264
01:08:45.233 --> 01:08:47.600
I've pictured
this moment so many times.

1265
01:08:47.734 --> 01:08:50.834
except in my mind it was
always you wearing the dress.

1266
01:08:50.967 --> 01:08:54.834
I haven't reached
that chapter of my life yet.

1267
01:08:54.967 --> 01:08:57.900
Haven't you?

1268
01:08:58.033 --> 01:09:01.567
I've never seen you so happy
as I have these past months.

1269
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.066
Excited to wake. to go to work.

1270
01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.600
Well. I've been bringing
the lighthouse back to life.

1271
01:09:07.734 --> 01:09:11.400
My darling.
it's you who has come to life.

1272
01:09:11.533 --> 01:09:14.467
You're laughing again.
there is joy.

1273
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.900
Call it what you like.
I know love when I see it.

1274
01:09:19.033 --> 01:09:23.533
Don't waste 30 years like
I did wondering where it went.

1275
01:09:25.266 --> 01:09:27.633
His life is abroad.

1276
01:09:27.767 --> 01:09:29.166
Mine is here.

1277
01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:31.900
How could I leave you?

1278
01:09:34.367 --> 01:09:35.633
How could I leave them?

1279
01:09:35.767 --> 01:09:38.066
Oh. my love.

1280
01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.266
I know you want to
keep your parents close.

1281
01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.734
but they're not here.
They are there.

1282
01:09:43.867 --> 01:09:45.266
They always will be.

1283
01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:48.266
You're holding onto what was.

1284
01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.633
it's time to
discover what can be.

1285
01:09:50.767 --> 01:09:52.500
You're not alone.

1286
01:09:52.633 --> 01:09:54.900
I love you. I always will.

1287
01:09:55.033 --> 01:09:56.834
wherever you are in the world.

1288
01:10:03.367 --> 01:10:06.433
Now. shall we get me married?

1289
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.934
S'il vous plait. tout monde.

1290
01:10:14.066 --> 01:10:17.000
Une petit second. Um...

1291
01:10:17.133 --> 01:10:19.667
Three decades I spent
searching for the thing

1292
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.633
that would make me feel whole.

1293
01:10:22.767 --> 01:10:25.734
when all I needed
was right here all along.

1294
01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:31.567
My dear Katherine. Je t'aime.

1295
01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:41.734
All: Vive le marié.

1296
01:10:57.433 --> 01:10:59.000
Oh!

1297
01:11:09.867 --> 01:11:12.467
Exactly.

1298
01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.967
May I?

1299
01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.200
You look beautiful.

1300
01:11:17.333 --> 01:11:18.734
Thank you.

1301
01:11:18.867 --> 01:11:20.967
You look--

1302
01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:21.967
French?

1303
01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.200
Oui.

1304
01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:25.567
Yes. Very French.

1305
01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:28.667
You surprise me at every turn.

1306
01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:32.700
What?

1307
01:11:32.834 --> 01:11:34.233
What is it?

1308
01:11:35.667 --> 01:11:38.133
I. um...

1309
01:11:38.266 --> 01:11:40.033
I got a call about
a job in Chicago.

1310
01:11:40.166 --> 01:11:42.734
It's one I've been
working on for a long time.

1311
01:11:42.867 --> 01:11:44.233
Ah.

1312
01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:47.300
And. um. you're going?

1313
01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.433
I'm going. yeah.

1314
01:11:52.533 --> 01:11:54.734
And that's it?

1315
01:11:54.867 --> 01:11:58.166
Moriah. this summer has
been the most amazing--

1316
01:11:58.300 --> 01:11:59.400
Don't do this.

1317
01:11:59.533 --> 01:12:00.934
Moriah--

1318
01:12:01.066 --> 01:12:02.934
No. You're doing what
you said you always do.

1319
01:12:03.066 --> 01:12:04.200
You're leaving before
things complicate.

1320
01:12:04.333 --> 01:12:06.734
But it is complicated.

1321
01:12:06.867 --> 01:12:09.467
Your life is here. My life is--

1322
01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.967
Yes. I understand. your life
is wherever the job takes you.

1323
01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:14.367
It's not that simple.

1324
01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.367
You know what?

1325
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.467
You don't need to
justify why you're going.

1326
01:12:21.567 --> 01:12:24.033
It's okay. Just go.

1327
01:12:25.734 --> 01:12:27.166
I don't want to leave like this.

1328
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.266
Maybe after Chicago
I can. um...

1329
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.133
I come back
and we could have more time.

1330
01:12:34.266 --> 01:12:35.500
And what?

1331
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.300
Ben. I don't want to spend
my life with someone who just

1332
01:12:39.433 --> 01:12:40.567
comes to see me
at their convenience.

1333
01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.867
Moriah. please.

1334
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.467
No. I can't.

1335
01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.300
Please. I can't do this.
Just. um...

1336
01:12:49.433 --> 01:12:51.667
If you're going to go.
please. just go.

1337
01:12:53.066 --> 01:12:55.467
Go.

1338
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.166
I'm sorry.

1339
01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.934
Moriah?

1340
01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.600
Ah. um...

1341
01:13:53.233 --> 01:13:56.800
I had this whole
thing prepared about--

1342
01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.867
Well. about love

1343
01:14:00.066 --> 01:14:02.900
and how it's pure

1344
01:14:03.033 --> 01:14:05.600
and everlasting and joyful.

1345
01:14:07.734 --> 01:14:10.033
But the truth is

1346
01:14:10.166 --> 01:14:13.066
I really don't know
anything about love.

1347
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.567
I do know that it surprises us.

1348
01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.934
That it arrives
when we least expect it.

1349
01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.934
Sometimes it's in a place.

1350
01:14:24.066 --> 01:14:26.166
or a person.

1351
01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:27.400
sometimes that person leaves...

1352
01:14:29.667 --> 01:14:32.967
...and sometimes they come back.

1353
01:14:39.633 --> 01:14:43.200
Sometimes they leave
this world unexpectedly

1354
01:14:43.333 --> 01:14:48.033
and you are left
wondering how you will go on.

1355
01:14:48.166 --> 01:14:49.834
But you do.

1356
01:14:49.967 --> 01:14:53.166
And sometimes it's
in the food we eat.

1357
01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.367
and the wine that we drink.

1358
01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:59.867
and the view that
leaves you breathless.

1359
01:15:00.066 --> 01:15:02.767
One thing I know for sure.

1360
01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:05.734
we can't control it.

1361
01:15:05.867 --> 01:15:07.500
no matter how hard we try.

1362
01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:12.066
And that leaves us
vulnerable to it.

1363
01:15:13.867 --> 01:15:16.233
And all we can do is surrender.

1364
01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:24.600
And these two
have done just that.

1365
01:15:24.734 --> 01:15:26.900
Katherine. Tantine.

1366
01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.834
No one deserves
this day more than you.

1367
01:15:32.967 --> 01:15:36.467
You are...

1368
01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.166
...oui. my aunt.

1369
01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.800
but my best friend.

1370
01:15:40.934 --> 01:15:42.533
my guardian angel.

1371
01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.767
I'm so happy you have
found your love again.

1372
01:15:50.767 --> 01:15:51.900
Je t'aime.

1373
01:15:52.033 --> 01:15:53.433
M'aussi.

1374
01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.166
Okay. That's it.

1375
01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.900
Ma félicitations.

1376
01:16:03.033 --> 01:16:04.266
Congratulations.

1377
01:16:13.533 --> 01:16:14.967
Let me speak to her.

1378
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.300
Yes.

1379
01:16:36.633 --> 01:16:39.000
When we were little.

1380
01:16:39.133 --> 01:16:40.533
do you recall
collecting the rolls

1381
01:16:40.667 --> 01:16:42.066
from the butcher paper?

1382
01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:46.333
We would stare through them
at the sky pretending we were

1383
01:16:46.467 --> 01:16:48.600
astronomers studying the stars.

1384
01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:52.734
We felt so insignificant.

1385
01:16:52.867 --> 01:16:57.367
like we were little specs
floating in the cosmos.

1386
01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.867
And yet. the woman before me

1387
01:17:00.066 --> 01:17:03.133
is anything but insignificant.

1388
01:17:04.934 --> 01:17:06.533
She's the brightest
star in the sky.

1389
01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.033
Take the risk.

1390
01:17:11.166 --> 01:17:13.734
You're worth it.

1391
01:17:13.867 --> 01:17:15.233
And so is he.

1392
01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.767
Hey.

1393
01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.266
Oh.

1394
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.133
Merci.

1395
01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:55.533
When I was younger I would stay
and dance all night.

1396
01:17:55.667 --> 01:17:56.867
but these days...

1397
01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.600
That song they played
for the first dance.

1398
01:18:02.734 --> 01:18:04.100
Do you know it?

1399
01:18:05.934 --> 01:18:08.967
It tells the story of
two strangers pushed together

1400
01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.000
by a dancing crowd.

1401
01:18:11.133 --> 01:18:14.266
and they feel something
they have never felt before.

1402
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.800
Joy and happiness.

1403
01:18:19.066 --> 01:18:21.300
They feel fulfilled.

1404
01:18:21.433 --> 01:18:25.367
But then. the crowd launches

1405
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.834
into a mad farandola.

1406
01:18:27.967 --> 01:18:30.166
everyone dancing together.

1407
01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:32.633
spinning in circles.

1408
01:18:32.767 --> 01:18:35.700
and our two strangers
are torn apart.

1409
01:19:08.734 --> 01:19:12.166
The strangers struggle
to find one another.

1410
01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:15.066
they cry out in pain.

1411
01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:18.333
To receive life's greatest gift.

1412
01:19:18.467 --> 01:19:21.200
and then have it snatched away.

1413
01:19:21.333 --> 01:19:22.867
They are lost.

1414
01:19:24.166 --> 01:19:25.533
Broken.

1415
01:19:28.133 --> 01:19:29.667
This was a mistake.

1416
01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.500
We have to go back.
I have to go back.

1417
01:19:36.734 --> 01:19:38.266
Stop the boat!

1418
01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.533
Yes. we must!

1419
01:19:39.667 --> 01:19:42.333
This man is in love!

1420
01:19:51.367 --> 01:19:52.500
Please work.

1421
01:20:08.166 --> 01:20:09.500
We're not stopping are we?

1422
01:20:09.633 --> 01:20:13.533
No. that was pretty
exciting though.

1423
01:20:41.133 --> 01:20:42.333
Ben!

1424
01:20:43.834 --> 01:20:45.433
I thought you left!

1425
01:20:45.567 --> 01:20:47.667
I did! I stole a lifeboat.

1426
01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:48.667
It was terrifying!

1427
01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.700
I tried to signal you.

1428
01:20:49.834 --> 01:20:51.700
but you came back!

1429
01:20:51.834 --> 01:20:52.734
I couldn't leave you.

1430
01:20:52.867 --> 01:20:55.000
I didn't want you to.

1431
01:20:55.133 --> 01:20:57.367
I'm in love with you.

1432
01:21:06.533 --> 01:21:07.734
I'm in love with you. too.

1433
01:21:09.533 --> 01:21:10.667
Lesson number two.

1434
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:13.100
The people in your life
are everything.

1435
01:21:26.367 --> 01:21:27.734
I swear. it wasn't me.

1436
01:21:35.967 --> 01:21:37.734
Nicholas: To love.

1437
01:21:39.467 --> 01:21:41.867
Both lost and found.

1438
01:21:43.967 --> 01:21:45.567
To new beginnings.

1439
01:21:47.633 --> 01:21:52.467
To the places we've been
and the places we're heading.

1440
01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.266
and to the light
that will always

1441
01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.066
be here to guide us home.

1442
01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.133
And to a honeymoon
30 years overdue.

1443
01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:05.000
All: Santé.

1444
01:22:08.433 --> 01:22:09.300
Nicholas.

1445
01:22:09.433 --> 01:22:10.633
Oh. right.

1446
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.667
The key.

1447
01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:16.400
Oui. We will take very good
care of it while you're away.

1448
01:22:16.533 --> 01:22:18.533
No. my darling.

1449
01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:22.166
You will take great care of it
because it belongs to you now.

1450
01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:25.233
The world deserves
to share in its beauty.

1451
01:22:25.367 --> 01:22:28.166
To revel in its history.

1452
01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.133
It's yours.

1453
01:22:30.266 --> 01:22:31.500
It always has been.

1454
01:22:36.333 --> 01:22:38.600
Besides. this cottage
isn't big enough for all of us.

1455
01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.500
We wanted you to have it.

1456
01:22:45.633 --> 01:22:47.333
Merci.

1457
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.300
Both: Je t'aime.

1458
01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:53.467
Nicholas:
We have a plane to catch.

1459
01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.200
Yes.

1460
01:22:55.333 --> 01:22:56.900
Okay. bye.

1461
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.433
Au revoir!

1462
01:23:04.567 --> 01:23:06.033
- Bon voyage!
- Katherine: Au revoir!

1463
01:23:06.166 --> 01:23:07.367
- Bon voyage!
- Katherine: Merci!
