10
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.024
Today is the day.

11
00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:10.153
Today is the last day
Private Network will be published.

12
00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:14.699
In a way. this is me.
the columnist Manuel Buendía.

13
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:18.453
saying farewell to my readers.

14
00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:23.208
I'm sure that some people
will be openly happy about it.

15
00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:26.544
while others will lament it a bit.

16
00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:30.548
But. being a bit contrary. as always.

17
00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:34.344
I should say neither group will be right.

18
00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:39.516
But what matters today

19
00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:46.147
is that I have a small farewell gift
for all my readers. on both sides.

20
00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:51.528
The end of the story
first chapter of which was published here

21
00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:55.365
on July 16th. 1963.

22
00:01:56.449 --> 00:02:00.245
When a journalist
ends a phase of his professional life.

23
00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:04.207
he inevitably gives into the temptation
of looking back

24
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.875
and asking himself.

25
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.254
"What was the most important.

26
00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.383
most entertaining. or most significant
information I published?"

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.345
PRIVATE NETWORK
BY MANUEL BUENDÍA

28
00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.860
We have to be careful
not to become more naive

29
00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:34.028
and more susceptible to propaganda.

30
00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:37.073
Remember. as someone once said long ago.

31
00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:40.577
"The first casualty of war is truth."

32
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.915
I contend that…

33
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.126
You can include this if you want.

34
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.254
History doesn't have owners.
History belongs to no one.

JORGE CARRILLO OLEA.
SUBSECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR

36
00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:58.261
All of us who write on these topics

37
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:01.222
have to get close to those we study…

SERGIO AGUAYO
JOURNALIST

39
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.268
…to understand
their points of view and how they think.

40
00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:09.606
How do you maintain your individuality
and keep your distance?

41
00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.400
I still don't know.

42
00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.613
One day. Manuel told me.

43
00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.657
"I have denounced gun traffickers.

44
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:24.662
I have denounced the Guadalajara Tecos.

45
00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:28.917
and tyrants like Rubén Figueroa."

46
00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.462
"But if I take on the drug lords.
I'm not just taking a risk.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.963
ALFONSO ZÁRATE
POLITICAL ANALYST

48
00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.381
I'm laying down my life."

49
00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:47.644
There was a day when I realized.
"There's something going on here."

50
00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:51.147
He was getting his shoes shined
in front of the Bellinghausen.

51
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.734
I said. "That's Manuel."
And I surprised him from behind.

52
00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:57.237
"Manuel!" He jumped a mile.

53
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.531
"Don't scare me like that!"
He was on edge.

54
00:04:03.618 --> 00:04:06.371
Manuel came and told us.

55
00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:09.290
"You won't believe
the story I'm working on."

56
00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.000
IVÁN RESTREPO
WRITER

57
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.752
"It's going to blow up."

58
00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:17.048
He looked pale. and he said.
"Virgilio. they're going to kill me."

59
00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:19.926
I said. "Manuel. why are you saying…?"

60
00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:21.094
VIRGILIO CABALLERO
JOURNALIST

61
00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:25.056
"Look at everything that's happening.
They're going to kill me."

62
00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:34.440
Look. if I were to be murdered…

63
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.861
and I were able to say
my famous last words.

64
00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:42.490
I would only say this. "I had it coming."

65
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.588
MEXICO CITY
WEDNESDAY MAY 30TH. 1984

66
00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.383
This afternoon. in Mexico City.
journalist Manuel Buendía was murdered.

67
00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:01.843
MURDER

68
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.637
The attackers fled.
Police are investigating.

69
00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:11.269
There were only two witnesses.

70
00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:16.316
Rogelio Barrera. a chartered accountant
who works close to the scene of the crime.

71
00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:21.154
The other witness is Buendía's coworker.
Juan Manuel Bautista.

72
00:05:21.237 --> 00:05:22.405
Juan Manuel Bautista.

73
00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:24.115
-Did you work with Buendía?
-Yes.

74
00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:26.492
-What did you do?
-I was his assistant.

75
00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:27.994
I worked in the archive.

76
00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:30.204
Around 6:30 in the evening.
I was working in the center.

77
00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.957
LUIS SOTO
JOURNALIST

78
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:40.465
and Juan Manuel called me.
and he told me what had happened.

79
00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:43.092
We were going to the parking garage.

80
00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:46.971
He was going to his car.
and I was going to make some copies.

81
00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:49.640
He asked me where I was going.

82
00:05:49.724 --> 00:05:52.060
I replied.
and that's the last thing he said.

83
00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:54.062
That's when I heard the shots.

84
00:05:57.607 --> 00:05:59.609
Turned around and saw him on the ground.

85
00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:03.112
-How many shots were fired?
-He was shot four times.

86
00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.616
Do you know
how long he was alive after being shot?

87
00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.702
-Or did he die instantly?
-I believe it was instant.

88
00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:15.333
I saw two people trying to run away.

89
00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:18.878
They ran to the corner of Liverpool Street
and then turned left.

90
00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:22.673
I saw a young man trying to help him.

91
00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:24.801
Apparently. it was his assistant.

92
00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:30.223
He tried to follow the shooters.

93
00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:32.850
I saw one of them.
and he tried to shoot me.

94
00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.268
but I moved aside.

95
00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:37.313
He bumped into someone while running away.

96
00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.232
I chased him. but lost sight of him.

97
00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:42.026
I came back to check on Buendía
and make calls.

98
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.947
He was obviously very upset. very anxious.

99
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.324
He called me right away.

100
00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:52.703
I told him to go to the office
and get me a number of a certain person.

101
00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:56.416
so I could get him to the scene.
He was a friend of Buendía's.

102
00:06:57.375 --> 00:07:00.044
Because I wasn't officially mandated
to do so before.

103
00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:01.337
Zorrilla called me.

104
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:03.756
JOSÉ ANTONIO ZORRILLA
DIRECTOR OF FEDERAL SECURITY. 1982–1985

105
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.842
And he said in that particular way of his.

106
00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:08.594
"Sir. did you know
that Buendía was killed?"

107
00:07:10.221 --> 00:07:11.389
His exact words.

108
00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:16.310
"No. Antonio. you just told me.
How else would I know?" I already knew.

109
00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.062
Since I got there very quickly…

110
00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:19.522
RAYMUNDO RIVA PALACIO
JOURNALIST

111
00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:24.110
…the bus that had stopped was still there.
The people were still there.

112
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.116
I knew Juan Manuel Bautista and Luis Soto.

113
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.286
I started to ask questions.

114
00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:37.081
The bus driver

115
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.877
said he had seen two people.

116
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:46.507
And another person.
a tall thin man who was the shooter.

117
00:07:52.096 --> 00:07:54.182
I ran from Varsovia Street…

118
00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:55.183
FÉLIX FUENTES
JOURNALIST

119
00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:56.851
…to Insurgentes Avenue.

120
00:07:58.394 --> 00:08:04.609
When I saw him there.
lying on the sidewalk in his trench coat…

121
00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:07.361
Just imagine!

122
00:08:07.945 --> 00:08:10.239
I owe him everything

123
00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:14.452
in terms of my development
and work as a reporter.

124
00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:23.169
I was five blocks away.
eating at a restaurant.

125
00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:24.712
JOSÉ REVELES
JOURNALIST

126
00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:26.923
When we found out. we left our food there.

127
00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.800
and we walked over to the scene.

128
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:33.554
There were reporters already on-site.

129
00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:38.643
We reported the story
because we were a news agency.

130
00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:43.397
MANUEL BUENDÍA SHOT FOUR TIMES IN THE BACK

131
00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.073
MURDER

132
00:08:54.116 --> 00:08:55.701
KILLED BY TWO UNKNOWN GUNMEN

133
00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:01.791
This morning-- I think it was today.
I don't know what time it is.

134
00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:02.959
I spoke with him.

135
00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.920
He was calm and joking around
with me. as usual.

136
00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.130
I expected him home early.

137
00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:11.926
I was the one who went to get him.

138
00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.761
That's all I have to say.

139
00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:28.442
MIGUEL DE LA MADRID
PRESIDENT OF MEXICO. 1982–1988

140
00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:34.448
He was next to her. Very close to her.

141
00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:38.202
MARÍA DOLORES ÁBALOS
MANUEL BUENDÍA'S WIDOW

142
00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:41.080
The truth is. that greeting
seemed enormously hypocritical

143
00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:45.585
because. of course.
Manuel was a victim of power.

144
00:09:47.044 --> 00:09:53.467
Some of those who attended the funeral
had been criticized by Buendía.

145
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.095
At times. the criticism was very scathing.

146
00:09:56.637 --> 00:09:58.848
I said to myself.

147
00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:02.351
"They've come to make sure
he's really dead."

148
00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:06.397
I strongly condemn what happened.

149
00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:09.400
Violence leads to nothing.

150
00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:12.945
JOURNALIST MURDERED

151
00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:17.658
JOURNALISM MOURNS

152
00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:26.959
I met him
almost 40 years ago on Bucareli Street.

153
00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:29.962
He was a crime reporter then.

154
00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:32.214
Later. he covered
the presidential affairs.

155
00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:35.134
We traveled the world together.

156
00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:38.387
On many occasions.
we shared the same typewriter.

157
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:45.895
It affected the whole world of journalism.

158
00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:49.940
There was a lot of anger

159
00:10:50.024 --> 00:10:52.902
but also a lot of fear among journalists.

160
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:59.283
We said. "So many people read his work."

161
00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:04.705
"If they can kill him.
what will they do to us?"

162
00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:15.883
Allow me to stop here

163
00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:19.637
and hand things over
to our presenter. Manuel Buendía.

164
00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.517
winner of the National Journalism Award
in 1977 and 1978.

165
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.519
with "What's Said Is Said."

166
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.609
Last Thursday…

167
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.906
in my column. which is published in

168
00:11:40.241 --> 00:11:43.119
30-some newspapers…

169
00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:52.753
We all know that the CIA
is an espionage and subversion agency.

170
00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:56.882
It's an instrument
of North American imperialism

171
00:11:57.675 --> 00:12:00.761
to accompany us during hard times

172
00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:03.973
and to make them even worse. So…

173
00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:07.101
read my column tomorrow. if you like.

174
00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:10.312
This was "What's Said Is Said."

175
00:12:10.938 --> 00:12:16.152
You'd always hear his readers asking.
"Did you read Buendía's column yet?"

176
00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:19.697
He didn't repeat himself
or make things up.

177
00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:21.365
He didn't lie.

178
00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:25.870
This gave weight
to the information he provided.

179
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:31.625
CLUELESS

180
00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:35.588
He was a surly-looking guy.

181
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.300
You could even say
he looked like a bodyguard.

182
00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:43.387
If you saw him. you'd think
he worked for a security agency.

183
00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:49.643
He always carried a gun.
either in his belt

184
00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.645
or once he showed me

185
00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:54.690
what looked like a thick book.

186
00:12:54.774 --> 00:12:57.359
with a gun under the cover.

187
00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.489
He rarely smiled.

188
00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:03.324
He was never flashy.

189
00:13:04.074 --> 00:13:08.704
He was always aware of his surroundings

190
00:13:08.788 --> 00:13:12.875
and of who was there.
even if it didn't seem like it.

191
00:13:15.211 --> 00:13:16.796
The first time I saw him.

192
00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:20.257
I said. "Wow. who is that grumpy man?"

193
00:13:21.592 --> 00:13:24.178
I remember
that he went after politicians a lot.

194
00:13:24.261 --> 00:13:25.763
ELENA PONIATOWSKA
WRITER

195
00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:29.225
He often reported on corruption.

196
00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:33.938
He knew a lot because he knew
the police from the inside.

197
00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.985
He was a cheerful man.
despite his somber face.

198
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:44.156
with his dark glasses and his mustache.

199
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.952
He didn't look friendly.
but he was very cheerful and nice.

200
00:13:48.035 --> 00:13:49.912
A great conversationalist.

201
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.541
We had a great time
talking about silly things.

202
00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.960
He'd grill me about certain issues.

203
00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:59.296
He was a journalist. after all.
And I'd let him.

204
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.590
Aren't you satisfied?

205
00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.175
I've told you that I was.

206
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:07.638
I'm very happy with the way
you've run the newspaper these past years.

207
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:11.141
I have to admit.
you increased circulation by 80%.

208
00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:13.978
you made the society pages more prominent.

209
00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:18.107
and you made the comic section
very funny for kids.

210
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.441
But that's not enough.

211
00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:23.028
You have to admit
this paper isn't the same as before.

212
00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:24.822
-What do you mean?
-Simple.

213
00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:27.658
Our reporters get their news
from official sources.

214
00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:31.912
We get bulletins
that are also published in other papers.

215
00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:33.455
This can't go on!

216
00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:57.980
It was a different Mexico.
a different context.

217
00:14:58.063 --> 00:14:59.732
It was a closed system.

218
00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:06.822
You had to learn
how to filter information through.

219
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:09.909
so that it wouldn't be self-censored.

220
00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:13.370
At that time.
we didn't really have censorship.

221
00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:16.165
but there was a lot of self-censorship.

222
00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:27.051
We didn't have censorship
like in other countries.

223
00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:30.471
where the authorities would read things
before they were published.

224
00:15:30.554 --> 00:15:34.516
But there was a strong link
between the press and power.

225
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.602
And a lot of money was involved.

226
00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:39.104
It was a mix of censorship

227
00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:45.152
and a strategic alliance
between the newspapers and the government.

228
00:15:45.235 --> 00:15:49.114
It was a time when the press
and the government were very close.

229
00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:57.831
Among the political tools

230
00:15:57.915 --> 00:15:59.750
the government has historically used

231
00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:02.336
CARMEN ARISTEGUI
JOURNALIST

232
00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:06.048
to influence the press in Mexico
was their control over the paper supply.

233
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:09.176
In the past.
we controlled the press through PIPSA.

234
00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:11.011
MIGUEL ALDANA
DIRECTOR OF INTERPOL MEXICO

235
00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:14.056
PIPSA
PRODUCER AND IMPORTER OF PAPER

236
00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:17.643
PIPSA produced newsprint.

237
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:20.938
They had a monopoly
on the production of newsprint.

238
00:16:21.021 --> 00:16:25.067
And the government used it
as a means of manipulating

239
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:30.823
editors and journalists in print media.

240
00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:34.618
They sold it
to the newspapers and magazines

241
00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:38.706
at a subsidized rate
in the form of bills they didn't collect.

242
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:43.210
So. the press
would accumulate outstanding bills.

243
00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:45.129
If they stepped out of line.

244
00:16:45.212 --> 00:16:49.091
there was a chance the government
would collect on that debt.

245
00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:52.052
which was a form of leverage.

246
00:16:54.304 --> 00:16:59.018
Journalism was completely
in the hands of the government.

247
00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:03.147
The columnists
were controlled by the president

248
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.481
through money.

249
00:17:04.565 --> 00:17:10.029
handouts. houses. cars. taxi permits.

250
00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:12.948
Allied writers and editors

251
00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:15.701
would receive something
known as "chayote."

252
00:17:17.494 --> 00:17:20.998
Which were envelopes filled with cash.

253
00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:24.710
According to my journalist colleagues…

254
00:17:24.793 --> 00:17:26.462
…chayote is a fruit

255
00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:31.383
that is very sweet in the center.

256
00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:35.137
but if you touch it. it'll prick you.

257
00:17:39.516 --> 00:17:41.602
FERNANDO GONZÁLEZ PARRA
DIRECTOR OF OVACIONES NEWSPAPER

258
00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:43.812
The biggest newspapers
in Mexico. economically speaking.

259
00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:46.231
always supported PRI candidates more.

260
00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:51.320
Excélsior was the most important paper.
from a political point of view.

261
00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.325
But La Prensa
was one of the popular tabloids

262
00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:58.243
that always sold well.

263
00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:03.874
Before becoming a journalist.
Buendía went to a seminary.

264
00:18:03.957 --> 00:18:05.542
a very conservative one.

265
00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:10.255
When he finally left the seminary.
because he didn't want to be a priest.

266
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.801
he went to work for the PAN's newspaper.

267
00:18:14.593 --> 00:18:15.677
La Nación.

268
00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:19.807
He was a Catholic man.

269
00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:21.767
fairly conservative.

270
00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:24.812
but he was the type of person
who can evolve.

271
00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:27.689
His way of thinking

272
00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:32.820
became more progressive.

273
00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:39.368
Somehow. while working for the PAN.

274
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:42.204
he became connected with La Prensa.

275
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.209
MANUEL BUENDÍA TELLEZGIRON
EDITOR

276
00:18:47.292 --> 00:18:51.547
His first article was a bit embarrassing.
but I'll tell you about it.

277
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.091
The story that started
Manuel's career as editor

278
00:18:54.174 --> 00:18:55.300
JEWISH BLOOD WAS ALREADY SHED

279
00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:57.469
was about some swastikas

280
00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:59.179
that were spray-painted
on some synagogues.

281
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:00.097
SWASTIKAS IN MEXICO!

282
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.765
That was his main story.

283
00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:03.851
HITLER REAWAKENS!

284
00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:06.353
LA PRENSA
THE PAPER THAT REPORTS WHAT OTHERS DON'T

285
00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:10.357
It was a newspaper
that mostly focused on crime.

286
00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:14.570
Manuel gave the newspaper

287
00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:18.448
a twist. a radical transformation.

288
00:19:18.532 --> 00:19:21.076
He got rid of the sensationalism

289
00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.746
and made it
a fundamentally informative paper

290
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.623
with a political edge.

291
00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:32.212
He said. "When your stories

292
00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.131
are read by the audience.

293
00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:36.967
they should read them with pleasure.

294
00:19:37.467 --> 00:19:39.261
without wanting to vomit."

295
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.522
A lot of us like crime stories.

296
00:19:52.316 --> 00:19:57.196
It's an art of patience.
an art… of the hunt.

297
00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:00.282
There are various techniques
a hunter can use.

298
00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:03.535
One of them
is to go in search of the prey.

299
00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:10.375
Another is to go to a place
where the prey might come to.

300
00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:15.380
Stay motionless. still as a statue.

301
00:20:17.716 --> 00:20:19.718
Finally. the animal appears.

302
00:20:20.219 --> 00:20:25.724
Standing or sitting.
you've got your finger on the trigger.

303
00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:30.479
You'll only have a moment
to take aim and shoot.

304
00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:38.195
I think there's a little cop in all of us.

305
00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:43.200
We had a press pass.

306
00:20:44.368 --> 00:20:46.036
They had a police badge.

307
00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:53.043
They gave some of us crime reporters
a police badge.

308
00:20:53.543 --> 00:20:54.795
What was it for?

309
00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:58.382
If there was a homicide.
I could show up and say I was an agent.

310
00:20:58.882 --> 00:21:01.593
If I said I was a reporter.
they wouldn't let me in.

311
00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:05.639
But as an agent. I could go in
and start gathering information.

312
00:21:05.722 --> 00:21:07.349
That's why we needed it.

313
00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:11.228
But that doesn't mean we were cops.

314
00:21:11.311 --> 00:21:14.731
FEDERAL SECURITY DIRECTORATE
DOCUMENTARY

315
00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:17.025
Mexico City is growing fast.

316
00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:21.738
as if it were trying to recover
from the past 80 years of stagnation.

317
00:21:22.656 --> 00:21:26.326
Large buildings are being erected.
which will make it a modern city.

318
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.955
One of those is that
of the Federal Security Directorate.

319
00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:32.082
In the '40s.

320
00:21:32.582 --> 00:21:37.713
as a result of the Cold War.

321
00:21:38.213 --> 00:21:41.008
in Mexico.
the Federal Security Directorate

322
00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:45.220
and the Directorate of Political
and Social Investigations were created.

323
00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:51.810
Agility is needed for this test.

324
00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:56.023
A member of the group
jumps over eight of his classmates

325
00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:58.734
and follows with a somersault.

326
00:21:59.234 --> 00:22:02.863
demonstrating his agility.

327
00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:08.910
Miguel Alemán created
the Federal Security Directorate.

328
00:22:09.536 --> 00:22:11.663
modeling it after the FBI

329
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:16.543
because Alemán
was interested in domestic enemies.

330
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.922
It was heroic. so to speak.

331
00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:23.467
JUAN RAFAEL MORO ÁVILA
AGENT OF THE FEDERAL SECURITY DIRECTORATE

332
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.844
They chose the best police force
for federal investigations.

333
00:22:25.927 --> 00:22:30.932
So much so. it was considered one
of the best police forces in the world.

334
00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:37.314
The commander pulled me aside and said.
"I'll give you a group of men."

335
00:22:37.397 --> 00:22:41.735
"I want you to train them
to ride motorcycles

336
00:22:41.818 --> 00:22:45.989
because I want a group of riders
who can take trained agents with them

337
00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:48.116
so that we can go anywhere."

338
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:50.827
I said. "That'll be hard to do."

339
00:22:50.911 --> 00:22:54.748
It was a difficult task. I said.
"Why don't we try something different?"

340
00:22:54.831 --> 00:22:58.168
"I'll speak to my buddies
whom I ride with."

341
00:22:58.251 --> 00:23:00.796
"They're already riders.
motorcycle racers."

342
00:23:00.879 --> 00:23:04.216
"We can hire them.
and they can help us out."

343
00:23:06.259 --> 00:23:08.804
And that's how
that famous group was formed.

344
00:23:08.887 --> 00:23:12.140
They'd say. "Here come the wasps!"
That's what we sounded like.

345
00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:15.185
Tons of bikes. running straight pipes.

346
00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:17.145
Just imagine! Real racers.

347
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:20.732
Did you learn something?

348
00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:25.070
Practice. and one day.
you will be able to do it like these guys.

349
00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:30.075
An interesting anecdote.

350
00:23:30.158 --> 00:23:34.204
In the United States.
FBI agents were called G-men.

351
00:23:34.287 --> 00:23:39.084
The Federal Security agents
called themselves "Giménez"

352
00:23:40.043 --> 00:23:44.256
trying to copy their idols
from the United States.

353
00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:50.595
They were very good
at gathering raw information.

354
00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:52.681
But they weren't analysts.

355
00:23:55.142 --> 00:23:57.978
The Federal Security Directorate
did everything

356
00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:02.774
an intelligence bureau had to do
to know everything about everyone.

357
00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:07.028
That includes… journalists.

358
00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:10.991
We had to have information.
We knew who was who.

359
00:24:11.074 --> 00:24:12.451
So. what happened?

360
00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:15.495
We knew everything about the journalists.

361
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:36.850
I've always thought
that there is an unbreakable bond

362
00:24:36.933 --> 00:24:38.101
between society and the press.

363
00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:39.936
LUIS ECHEVERRÍA
PRESIDENT OF MEXICO. 1970–1976

364
00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.980
The interplay between the press and power.

365
00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:45.192
revolution. opposition.
has always been strong.

366
00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:50.071
The press also had to make some progress.

367
00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:52.657
That was Luis Echeverría's
signature approach

368
00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:54.993
since he ran for president.

369
00:24:56.161 --> 00:25:00.624
presenting himself
in a way that wasn't authentic.

370
00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:05.504
I think he was a born oppressor.
A very evil person.

371
00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:08.423
Easily influenced young people!

372
00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:12.302
We will oppose them.
wherever they come from.

373
00:25:12.385 --> 00:25:14.846
Whether it's the bureaucracy.

374
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.724
or the corporations.

375
00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:21.478
or the nefarious agencies

376
00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:23.522
controlled from abroad.

377
00:25:25.982 --> 00:25:27.776
Alfonso Martínez Domínguez

378
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.029
was appointed to the municipal government

379
00:25:31.112 --> 00:25:32.531
by Echeverría.

380
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:35.825
He appointed him mayor of Mexico City.

381
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:42.332
So. Alfonso looked for someone
with journalistic credentials

382
00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:44.459
to be his press officer.

383
00:25:45.001 --> 00:25:46.336
He thought of Buendía

384
00:25:46.419 --> 00:25:50.006
to work for the municipal government
in communications.

385
00:25:52.634 --> 00:25:54.344
PRESS OFFICE AND PUBLIC RELATIONS
MEXICO CITY

386
00:25:54.427 --> 00:25:55.929
It was Corpus Christi Thursday

387
00:25:56.012 --> 00:25:57.847
and Manuel Buendía's name day.

388
00:25:58.598 --> 00:26:05.146
All of the reporters that covered the city
decided to host a dinner for him.

389
00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:12.112
All of a sudden.
Buendía said. "I have to go."

390
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:16.491
"There's something going on.
and I think it's serious."

391
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:21.788
Freedom! Mexico!

392
00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:24.916
Echeverría was determined
to prevent the students

393
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.210
from protesting in the streets again.

394
00:26:27.294 --> 00:26:29.629
They hadn't taken to the streets
since 1968.

395
00:26:30.171 --> 00:26:31.464
FORCES OPPOSING MEXICO'S PROGRESS

396
00:26:31.548 --> 00:26:32.799
Few people remember that Buendía

397
00:26:32.882 --> 00:26:34.551
STRANGE INFLUENCES WANT TO TRICK OUR YOUTH

398
00:26:34.634 --> 00:26:39.431
happened to be on the wrong side
of the Corpus Christi Massacre.

399
00:26:40.056 --> 00:26:43.476
but he wasn't a promoter
of the official version either.

400
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.644
WHO ARE THE HALCONES?

401
00:26:44.728 --> 00:26:47.105
FORMAL COMPLAINT
BY PHOTOGRAPHERS AND REPORTERS

402
00:26:47.188 --> 00:26:50.317
The Halcones were created and trained.

403
00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:54.404
with their top brass in Japan.

404
00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:56.489
CUENCA DÍAZ SAYS THE HALCONES
AREN'T PART OF THE ARMY

405
00:26:56.573 --> 00:26:58.033
I don't know who had the bright idea…

406
00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:00.327
MARTÍNEZ DOMINGUEZ AFFIRMS
THAT THE "HALCONES" DON'T EXIST

407
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:05.665
…to use them against the youth protest.

408
00:27:05.749 --> 00:27:07.417
THE EVENTS UNRAVELED LIKE THIS:

409
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.837
SCENE OF THE EVENT
RIOT CONTROL TANKS

410
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.174
LINE OF PROTESTERS

411
00:27:14.257 --> 00:27:16.259
RIOT POLICE

412
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:18.345
OPPOSING GROUPS

413
00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:42.494
WE WILL NOT ALLOW DISORDERLY CONDUCT

414
00:27:42.577 --> 00:27:45.789
NOBODY IN UNIFORM
PARTICIPATED IN THE CLASH

415
00:27:45.872 --> 00:27:48.291
THE MAYOR CAN'T FOOL US
IT WAS AN OFFICIAL MASSACRE

416
00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:53.588
Buendía had to manage
the information on this issue.

417
00:27:54.714 --> 00:28:00.220
Out of respect for his boss.
and because of the official role he had.

418
00:28:00.303 --> 00:28:06.810
But it was obviously a setup
in Echeverría's signature style.

419
00:28:06.893 --> 00:28:10.313
where he said one thing but did another.

420
00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:18.196
THOSE RESPONSIBLE WILL BE PUNISHED

421
00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:19.280
WE WILL MOVE FORWARD! - LE

422
00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:21.825
Manuel Buendía said to me. "Look."

423
00:28:22.867 --> 00:28:25.245
"From what I can see. this is over."

424
00:28:25.954 --> 00:28:27.914
"But the president

425
00:28:28.665 --> 00:28:35.588
is asking my boss. Alfonso.
to hold a huge demonstration in the Zócalo

426
00:28:36.089 --> 00:28:40.593
to support him and smooth things over
after what happened with the Halcones."

427
00:28:45.056 --> 00:28:46.433
There was a crowd.

428
00:28:46.516 --> 00:28:48.560
He packed the Zócalo.

429
00:28:48.643 --> 00:28:53.022
Echeverría was gloating
in the National Palace.

430
00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:18.089
When the event was over.

431
00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:20.925
he said. "Alfonso.

432
00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:26.514
I'm really grateful
for the demonstration you organized.

433
00:29:26.598 --> 00:29:28.641
and I'm going to ask for a favor."

434
00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:33.646
"Please tell your wife and your children

435
00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:38.359
that. moving forward.
you will devote yourself to them…

436
00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:39.986
NEW MAYOR

437
00:29:40.069 --> 00:29:43.865
…because you've already given me
all the help I need."

438
00:29:44.407 --> 00:29:46.117
That's how he fired him.

439
00:29:46.201 --> 00:29:48.912
THERE WILL BE
NO SETBACKS IN MEXICO'S PROGRESS

440
00:29:58.129 --> 00:29:59.088
Look.

441
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:02.592
journalism is definitely a form of power.

442
00:30:03.843 --> 00:30:07.305
It's real.
You exercise power through the press.

443
00:30:08.932 --> 00:30:11.684
We have influence over society.

444
00:30:12.852 --> 00:30:14.562
We have authority.

445
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.441
Like many others before me. I ask myself.

446
00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.654
"Who the hell gave us that power?"

447
00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.448
"Did we take it by force?"

448
00:30:26.282 --> 00:30:27.659
"Did we inherit it?"

449
00:30:30.453 --> 00:30:36.376
The change in Manuel Buendía
after being a civil servant for a while.

450
00:30:36.459 --> 00:30:37.836
when civil servants…

451
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:43.591
That time was completely erased.
You didn't mention it.

452
00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:47.846
And it didn't matter because Manuel
had already taken on his role

453
00:30:47.929 --> 00:30:53.852
as one of the most avid critics
of the Mexican political system.

454
00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:00.066
PRIVATE NETWORK

455
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:02.610
"Contamination and Tyranny."

456
00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:08.533
Excélsior.
October 11th. 1979. by Manuel Buendía.

457
00:31:11.578 --> 00:31:15.456
The Acapulco Bay
is as contaminated with human waste…

458
00:31:16.165 --> 00:31:19.043
as the Guerrero government
is with tyranny.

459
00:31:23.673 --> 00:31:25.800
A chemical analysis of water samples

460
00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:29.262
shows that eight locations
on the Acapulco Bay

461
00:31:29.345 --> 00:31:34.475
have water contaminated
with bacteria that is usually found

462
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.853
in human feces.

463
00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:43.067
A political analysis
showed that the state police chief

464
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:46.446
has ties with notorious criminals.

465
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.158
As a result of those two short reports.

466
00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:56.205
this columnist faced
a frightful avalanche of insults.

467
00:31:56.289 --> 00:31:58.875
provocations. and threats.

468
00:31:58.958 --> 00:32:01.961
THE YEAR 1981

469
00:32:02.045 --> 00:32:04.672
A TRIP TO MEXICO

470
00:32:04.756 --> 00:32:07.467
BROADCAST #1
MR. GOVERNOR!

471
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:12.639
He told me about the difficult time he had

472
00:32:14.349 --> 00:32:18.186
when Rubén Figueroa threatened his life.

473
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:21.564
Manuel said that when
he would pull up to his home.

474
00:32:21.648 --> 00:32:23.274
he'd put on his high beams.

475
00:32:23.358 --> 00:32:27.654
and he would slowly
illuminate the surroundings

476
00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:31.157
to see if anyone was hiding there.

477
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.870
He said that he learned
to open the door with his left hand.

478
00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:38.915
while he had his right hand on his gun.

479
00:32:38.998 --> 00:32:43.586
Rubén Figueroa Figueroa
was a shady figure in Mexican politics.

480
00:32:44.504 --> 00:32:47.048
He was one of those people

481
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:49.550
who go down in history

482
00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:53.846
because of the freakish stories
about them.

483
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.432
rather than for their
political achievements.

484
00:32:57.642 --> 00:33:02.438
When they ask questions that I don't like.

485
00:33:03.064 --> 00:33:05.274
well. when that happens. I…

486
00:33:06.025 --> 00:33:07.944
shoot them in the eye
without touching an eyelash.

487
00:33:08.027 --> 00:33:09.779
RUBÉN FIGUEROA
GOVERNOR OF GUERRERO. 1975–1981

488
00:33:09.862 --> 00:33:15.910
I distinctly remember his habit

489
00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:20.373
of holding meetings.
giving orders. and doing everything

490
00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:23.209
from a swimming pool
in his swimming trunks.

491
00:33:25.211 --> 00:33:26.754
Yes. Mr. President?

492
00:33:27.839 --> 00:33:29.424
A school collapsed?

493
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.426
Three dead?

494
00:33:32.218 --> 00:33:34.679
Poor children… We're very sorry.

495
00:33:34.762 --> 00:33:36.597
What was the cause?

496
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.977
It was very old? What town is it in?

497
00:33:42.478 --> 00:33:44.689
Tenancingo.
in the municipality of Tlalchapa.

498
00:33:44.772 --> 00:33:46.107
Write it down. please.

499
00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:51.029
Also. he also used to say.
"I want to be buried…"

500
00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:53.531
With a bra covering my eyes

501
00:33:54.615 --> 00:33:58.119
and panties over my heart.

502
00:33:59.579 --> 00:34:02.915
That fat. ugly man?

503
00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:07.503
Yes. he threatened him.
That governor was dangerous.

504
00:34:07.587 --> 00:34:09.255
He was afraid of him.

505
00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:13.760
It's ready to use.

506
00:34:14.594 --> 00:34:15.887
He was bloodthirsty.

507
00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:18.848
He killed several journalists

508
00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:22.435
and more people in Guerrero
than anyone knows about.

509
00:34:23.019 --> 00:34:26.564
Manuel Buendía wrote about it constantly.

510
00:34:30.818 --> 00:34:34.989
They say they that soft people
are meant to be eaten.

511
00:34:36.282 --> 00:34:40.703
I'd rather be known
for being tough than soft.

512
00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:44.040
I had breakfast
with him once for an event.

513
00:34:44.123 --> 00:34:46.876
He bragged to me.

514
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:52.006
"We barely have guerrillas anymore.
We've turned them into fishermen."

515
00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.299
"And it's going great."

516
00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:58.137
I asked. "How's that. Rubén?"

517
00:34:58.221 --> 00:35:03.643
"We take them. and with the help
of our friends in the Army.

518
00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:07.146
we drop them into the sea
from a plane or a helicopter."

519
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.317
"Some can't swim." That's what happened.

520
00:35:14.237 --> 00:35:16.114
Let's remember his famous saying.

521
00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:20.701
"In Guerrero. there are no
political prisoners or missing persons."

522
00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:22.370
"They're all dead."

523
00:35:23.913 --> 00:35:27.667
Naturally. Figueroa was very offended

524
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:32.046
by the things Manuel revealed
about his corrupt government.

525
00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:35.967
And since he had already killed people

526
00:35:36.509 --> 00:35:38.010
in the state of Guerrero.

527
00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:43.558
the threat against Manuel Buendía
by a murderous governor was serious.

528
00:35:45.726 --> 00:35:48.521
The threat from Mr. Rubén.
far from worrying me.

529
00:35:49.188 --> 00:35:51.649
now gives me some sort of protection

530
00:35:51.732 --> 00:35:57.113
from being run over.
bar brawls. and even spoiled seafood.

531
00:35:58.781 --> 00:36:03.077
Manuel had what I would call
a dark sense of humor.

532
00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:10.459
You noticed how…
he would put together questions

533
00:36:10.543 --> 00:36:15.506
to be as venomous as possible
towards the person being addressed.

534
00:36:16.549 --> 00:36:18.551
What will those young men become?

535
00:36:19.051 --> 00:36:20.469
What are they now?

536
00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:24.765
Well. they are psychopaths
that. in the future.

537
00:36:24.849 --> 00:36:30.980
will be added to the collections
of Mexico's criminal museum.

538
00:36:41.073 --> 00:36:43.910
I went to his office a few times.

539
00:36:43.993 --> 00:36:48.915
He called it the MIA.
the Mexican Intelligence Agency.

540
00:36:48.998 --> 00:36:51.834
to mock the CIA.

541
00:36:55.504 --> 00:36:56.964
I asked him.

542
00:36:57.048 --> 00:37:03.846
"Manuel. where do you get
your information from?"

543
00:37:05.264 --> 00:37:08.726
"Is it from your buddies
at the Federal Security Directorate?"

544
00:37:08.809 --> 00:37:12.146
"Is it from the president's office?"

545
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.564
He said. "Look. Jorge.

546
00:37:15.107 --> 00:37:17.902
it's all in the press."

547
00:37:17.985 --> 00:37:19.946
"But people don't know how to read."

548
00:37:20.613 --> 00:37:23.157
"You have to read the newspapers."

549
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.327
"You have to read the sports section.

550
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.081
the gossip pages…

551
00:37:31.499 --> 00:37:32.416
THE CIA KNOWS ABOUT YOU

552
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.253
…and especially the crime section."

553
00:37:36.337 --> 00:37:38.547
He would make clippings.

554
00:37:39.173 --> 00:37:41.467
and he would put them in little bags.

555
00:37:42.343 --> 00:37:45.680
The archive started to grow.

556
00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:49.141
It went from 20 files

557
00:37:49.225 --> 00:37:53.020
to almost 4.000 files.

558
00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:55.314
I said. "It's true!"

559
00:37:55.398 --> 00:37:57.316
"This guy's discovering things

560
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.862
that we see every day
without realizing it."

561
00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:05.741
That is the eye of a true journalist.

562
00:38:11.831 --> 00:38:16.961
It's commonly accepted that the world's
oldest profession is prostitution.

563
00:38:18.504 --> 00:38:23.175
But I would be willing to argue
that espionage is just as old.

564
00:38:23.843 --> 00:38:26.012
It's possible
\the oldest reference to espionage…

565
00:38:26.095 --> 00:38:27.722
THE BIBLE

566
00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:30.099
…to spies and their role in society.

567
00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:33.269
dates back to 4.000 years before Christ.

568
00:38:33.352 --> 00:38:37.898
It's found in Chapter two. verse three
in the Book of Joshua.

569
00:38:39.358 --> 00:38:44.697
Joshua. son of Nun.
secretly sent two spies from Shittim

570
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.743
and said.
"Go learn about Jericho and its land."

571
00:38:49.618 --> 00:38:53.956
They went to the house
of a whore named Rahab.

572
00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.541
and stayed there.

573
00:38:57.209 --> 00:39:00.880
Here. we see how two
of the world's oldest professions

574
00:39:00.963 --> 00:39:02.923
meet in an intriguing situation.

575
00:39:04.717 --> 00:39:09.013
Six thousand years later.
things are more or less the same.

576
00:39:17.229 --> 00:39:20.107
On the ground. please!

577
00:39:22.276 --> 00:39:25.863
The concept of the European Cold War

578
00:39:26.906 --> 00:39:30.576
reached a new height or had a second wave

579
00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:33.037
in Central America.

580
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.914
BLANCHE PIETRICH
JOURNALIST

581
00:39:34.997 --> 00:39:38.751
The United States
and the North American media

582
00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:43.547
thought or fabricated the idea

583
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:48.302
that Nicaragua was fighting
the last frontier against communism

584
00:39:48.386 --> 00:39:51.764
and the remaining Soviet
and Cuban influence in the continent.

585
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.933
My fellow Americans…

586
00:39:54.016 --> 00:39:56.936
RONALD REAGAN
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 1980–1988

587
00:39:57.019 --> 00:39:59.939
…I ask for this time
to tell you of some basic decisions

588
00:40:00.022 --> 00:40:01.649
which are yours to make.

589
00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:04.360
I believe
it's my constitutional responsibility

590
00:40:04.443 --> 00:40:06.153
to place these matters before you.

591
00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:10.324
We do not start wars.
We will never be the aggressor.

592
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:15.579
"Associate Thugs." El Sol de México.

593
00:40:16.497 --> 00:40:20.543
February 6th. 1978. by Manuel Buendía.

594
00:40:22.169 --> 00:40:26.090
It is the US newspapers.
and not those from the Soviet Union.

595
00:40:26.715 --> 00:40:29.385
that have recently provided evidence

596
00:40:29.468 --> 00:40:32.096
that the Reagan administration

597
00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:37.017
is directly involved
in a series of attacks against Nicaragua

598
00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.146
which could be the prelude to an invasion.

599
00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:46.485
The Sandinista rule
is a Communist reign of terror.

600
00:40:46.569 --> 00:40:50.322
They want to shoot their way into power
and establish totalitarian rule.

601
00:40:50.406 --> 00:40:51.532
Thousands who fought

602
00:40:51.615 --> 00:40:54.618
with the Sandinistas
have taken up arms against them

603
00:40:54.702 --> 00:40:56.620
and are now called the Contras.

604
00:40:56.704 --> 00:40:58.289
They are freedom fighters.

605
00:40:58.372 --> 00:41:00.749
We. Americans. should be proud

606
00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:03.377
of what we are trying to do
in Central America.

607
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:06.130
This is not only
in our strategic interest.

608
00:41:06.213 --> 00:41:07.506
It is morally right

609
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:11.010
that we want no hostile communist colonies

610
00:41:11.093 --> 00:41:14.763
here in the Americas.
South. Central. or North.

611
00:41:16.056 --> 00:41:19.351
Thank you. God bless you. and good night.

612
00:41:19.435 --> 00:41:26.150
At the very start of the war
during the armed conflict in El Salvador.

613
00:41:27.026 --> 00:41:28.736
Nacho Rodríguez Terrazas

614
00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:31.947
was the first foreign journalist
killed in El Salvador.

615
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:34.450
IGNACIO RODRÍGUEZ
WE CONTINUE YOUR WORK

616
00:41:34.533 --> 00:41:38.078
I called Manuel Buendía that night.
completely shocked.

617
00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:41.957
Buendía gave me advice about what to do.

618
00:41:42.041 --> 00:41:45.127
We organized an impressive demonstration.

619
00:41:45.211 --> 00:41:47.963
We spoke to the media
so that all of us would be there

620
00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:51.634
when Nacho Rodríguez Terrazas's
body arrived.

621
00:41:52.593 --> 00:41:55.638
That was the first reality check for me.

622
00:41:55.721 --> 00:41:56.931
And for others too.

623
00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:58.974
All Mexican journalists are shaken…

624
00:41:59.058 --> 00:42:00.768
PRIVATE NETWORK
REQUIEM FOR IGNACIO

625
00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:05.231
…by the murder of our colleague
Ignacio Rodríguez Terrazas.

626
00:42:05.314 --> 00:42:07.816
He died as he surely would have chosen.

627
00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:09.568
In action.

628
00:42:10.903 --> 00:42:14.823
He basically died
in the arms of two other journalists

629
00:42:14.907 --> 00:42:17.368
who were filled with shock and rage.

630
00:42:18.827 --> 00:42:23.999
As long as there are honest journalists
in Mexico. we will honor his name.

631
00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:27.419
Let's promise what we must promise.

632
00:42:28.128 --> 00:42:30.506
let's risk what we must risk

633
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:34.343
to be worthy colleagues
to that 28-year-old man

634
00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:36.262
who set the example.

635
00:42:39.431 --> 00:42:41.809
Whenever anything important happened.

636
00:42:42.685 --> 00:42:45.563
the next day. other columnists

637
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:50.234
would write about it
and give their analysis.

638
00:42:50.859 --> 00:42:54.280
Then you'd read Private Network.
and it'd be about something else.

639
00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:58.325
Days would go by.
and Manuel would write about other things.

640
00:42:58.409 --> 00:43:01.245
Until suddenly. there it'd be.

641
00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:03.831
"Bombs from the Right."

642
00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:08.460
El Universal. February 2nd. 1978.

643
00:43:08.544 --> 00:43:11.338
The technique used to plant a bomb

644
00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:13.257
in the Cuban ambassador's car

645
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.843
is 100% North American.

646
00:43:16.635 --> 00:43:19.471
Nothing is improvised.
Nothing is left to chance.

647
00:43:19.972 --> 00:43:21.890
This isn't a game.

648
00:43:22.683 --> 00:43:24.435
Bombs are a message.

649
00:43:24.518 --> 00:43:26.478
THE CHRISTIAN FAMILY
50.000 YELL. "NO TO ABORTION!"

650
00:43:26.562 --> 00:43:29.481
Messages don't always say the same thing.
nor are they sent by one person.

651
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.194
Guadalajara has one of the oldest
and most violent fascist organizations…

652
00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:37.906
THE TERRORIST HAD A BACKUP GRENADE

653
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.366
…with the most members.

654
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.784
THEY PREFER DEATH OVER COMMUNISM

655
00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:43.454
The Tecos.
these people from the far right.

656
00:43:43.537 --> 00:43:47.541
some of them have German heritage.

657
00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:53.339
They come
from an almost pro-Nazi background.

658
00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:00.429
FASCISTS?

659
00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:03.807
Our fascism doesn't have a face.

660
00:44:03.891 --> 00:44:05.684
It's an act of nature.

661
00:44:06.185 --> 00:44:09.313
Like a sunset or a dust storm.

662
00:44:13.525 --> 00:44:16.528
Manuel had published some fierce articles

663
00:44:16.612 --> 00:44:20.282
against the University of Guadalajara.

664
00:44:20.366 --> 00:44:23.869
Because they were
a far-right organization.

665
00:44:23.952 --> 00:44:25.871
They were dangerous. murderous…

666
00:44:25.954 --> 00:44:27.081
WHAT ARE THE "TECOS"?
ANTORCHA

667
00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:29.750
It's headquartered at
the Autonomous University of Guadalajara.

668
00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:32.461
It controls the majority
of students and professors.

669
00:44:32.544 --> 00:44:34.588
and its symbol is an owl

670
00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:37.383
because it watches and lurks in the dark.

671
00:44:38.008 --> 00:44:41.011
In 1967 or 1966. I don't remember exactly.
monitoring of Manuel Buendía began.

672
00:44:41.095 --> 00:44:42.888
RAMÓN LIRA
JUDICIAL POLICE OFFICER. 1971–1985

673
00:44:44.556 --> 00:44:47.559
JUDICIAL POLICE

674
00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:49.353
They ordered me to monitor him.

675
00:44:50.145 --> 00:44:52.773
-Who ordered you?
-The heads of the Tecos.

676
00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:57.444
THE CUESTA-GALLARDOS

677
00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:01.990
I was there when they gave the order
to kill him at the earliest opportunity.

678
00:45:02.074 --> 00:45:03.534
WE MUST GET TO THE ROOT OF THE ATTACK

679
00:45:03.617 --> 00:45:04.618
He was bothering them.

680
00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:07.079
AMERICAN AGENT WHO THREW
THE GRENADE DIDN'T ACT ALONE

681
00:45:07.162 --> 00:45:12.126
He was an observer with a keen eye

682
00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:14.461
for published information.

683
00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:20.509
Maybe he would find an article
in one of the sections of the newspaper

684
00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:26.473
about a shipment of weapons
that was detected at the border.

685
00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:31.061
And a few days later.
he'd suddenly find something else

686
00:45:31.145 --> 00:45:34.523
that seemed to be
a part of the same puzzle.

687
00:45:34.606 --> 00:45:39.027
And that's how
he put together most of his articles.

688
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.323
Manuel Buendía had several regulars.

689
00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:46.160
and Gerhard Mertins was one of them.

690
00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:47.870
PRIVATE NETWORK
ARMS FOR SALE

691
00:45:47.953 --> 00:45:50.164
One of the key
international arms traffickers.

692
00:45:50.247 --> 00:45:54.918
a former Nazi SS member.
has established offices in Mexico.

693
00:45:55.669 --> 00:46:00.883
And in his own words. he conducts
his Central American operations from here

694
00:46:00.966 --> 00:46:03.093
to fight Communism.

695
00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.016
He was one of their suppliers.

696
00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:12.060
and he had close relations
with the armed forces.

697
00:46:12.144 --> 00:46:14.396
THEY WILL BRING BUENDÍA'S GERMAN

698
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.064
MERTINS. PRIME SUSPECT

699
00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.280
In the '80s. Mexico
was the world capital of espionage.

700
00:46:23.363 --> 00:46:24.865
Everyone was here.

701
00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:29.536
Soviets. East Germany. Cuba.

702
00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.622
Let me see…

703
00:46:31.705 --> 00:46:35.167
Today I… This afternoon…

704
00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:36.168
Yes.

705
00:46:37.377 --> 00:46:41.048
I'm meeting
with a group of Nicaraguans to talk.

706
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:43.008
After that. I have a dinner.

707
00:46:43.091 --> 00:46:44.802
That means…

708
00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:49.973
Only if it could be around 6:30.

709
00:46:50.057 --> 00:46:50.891
Yes.

710
00:46:50.974 --> 00:46:54.728
So. you're busy at…

711
00:46:54.812 --> 00:46:56.146
-Five.
-At five?

712
00:46:57.189 --> 00:46:58.774
Yes. and later. at 8:30.

713
00:46:58.857 --> 00:47:03.779
It was a hotbed of espionage
that Mexico didn't participate in.

714
00:47:03.862 --> 00:47:07.533
Shamefully.
Mexico did participate in some way.

715
00:47:09.201 --> 00:47:11.745
Which was by wiretapping all the phones

716
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:14.248
from lists provided by the CIA.

717
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:18.585
We did the dirty work for the CIA.

718
00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:21.505
-What is your address. sir?
-Forty-eight Nápoles Street.

719
00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:24.883
-Nápoles…
-Forty-eight.

720
00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:27.427
-Forty-eight.
-Yes.

721
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:29.221
-Which floor?
-Second floor.

722
00:47:29.304 --> 00:47:33.141
-Second floor.
-Between Londres and Liverpool Street.

723
00:47:35.769 --> 00:47:38.438
They used recorders that would be off.

724
00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:41.775
and the moment
someone picked up the phone.

725
00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:44.528
the machine
would turn on and start recording.

726
00:47:47.489 --> 00:47:49.616
When they hang up.
the recorder would stop.

727
00:47:50.492 --> 00:47:55.914
Then very good typists

728
00:47:55.998 --> 00:47:58.542
transcribed the conversation.

729
00:48:03.088 --> 00:48:05.883
Lawrence Sternfield. 52 years old.

730
00:48:05.966 --> 00:48:08.468
is the current head of the CIA in Mexico.

731
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:11.847
His undercover identity is an attaché

732
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.808
to the group of diplomatic officials

733
00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:21.523
that the United States government
officially confirmed were here in 1977.

734
00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:22.566
JESÚS ESQUIVEL
JOURNALIST

735
00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:26.737
Any hint that reveals
the identity of a CIA agent.

736
00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:31.533
puts them in a vulnerable position.
wherever they are.

737
00:48:33.035 --> 00:48:37.915
Not only do they consider
themselves in danger.

738
00:48:38.498 --> 00:48:42.336
but they also consider
the national security of the US in danger.

739
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.340
So for a Mexican journalist

740
00:48:47.799 --> 00:48:53.180
to know the identities
of CIA operatives and agents in Mexico

741
00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:56.350
wasn't just a big professional victory.

742
00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:59.394
but it also meant
that Manuel Buendía had good connections.

743
00:49:00.312 --> 00:49:02.105
Stewart Burton. 52 years old.

744
00:49:02.981 --> 00:49:04.942
failed religious preacher.

745
00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:08.403
is the current head of the CIA in Mexico.

746
00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:12.658
His office is located
at 48 Río de la Plata.

747
00:49:13.367 --> 00:49:16.203
And if you want to ask him
something about the CIA.

748
00:49:16.828 --> 00:49:21.333
you can call him at 633-59-80.

749
00:49:21.416 --> 00:49:24.336
Dr. Phillip Aler. James Anderson.

750
00:49:24.419 --> 00:49:28.423
Robert Bruce. Gilbert Carey.
William Carson. Harry Chandler…

751
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:36.223
Every country and government
has its own spies.

752
00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:41.645
its own intelligence service
to collect information.

753
00:49:42.354 --> 00:49:47.025
But information services
are one thing. and espionage is another.

754
00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:50.862
And subversive acts are even worse.

755
00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:53.615
"The dirty work." as the Americans say.

756
00:49:53.699 --> 00:49:55.033
"The dirty work."

757
00:49:55.617 --> 00:49:57.536
The CIA murdered people here.

758
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:03.500
When the article came out.
and we got together to talk.

759
00:50:03.583 --> 00:50:07.629
we were afraid
something would happen to him

760
00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:11.883
because we knew what the CIA did
in Latin America and all over the world.

761
00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:13.552
They plant a bomb.

762
00:50:13.635 --> 00:50:15.762
or you're in a car crash.
and it looks like an accident.

763
00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:17.222
HE KILLED HIS WIFE AND THEN HIMSELF

764
00:50:17.305 --> 00:50:20.809
Manuel was very brave
with what he published.

765
00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:22.978
I knew about the Tecos.

766
00:50:23.645 --> 00:50:26.606
I knew
about Mr. Mertins's gun trafficking.

767
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.193
I knew about several enemies of his
that were hypothetical suspects

768
00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:32.821
in the Buendía case.

769
00:50:33.613 --> 00:50:34.990
So. they never knew…

770
00:50:35.073 --> 00:50:38.285
In my opinion.
it was almost the perfect crime.

771
00:50:38.368 --> 00:50:42.247
When do journalists.
covering these stories. cross the line

772
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:45.584
and put themselves at risk?

773
00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:47.002
It's in the details.

774
00:50:47.085 --> 00:50:50.005
The person
who published detailed information…

775
00:50:52.174 --> 00:50:53.675
was Manuel Buendía.

776
00:50:58.013 --> 00:51:03.226
I think that retaliation
and risks are part of the job.

777
00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:08.648
As I've said many times before.

778
00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:11.443
"You have to take the rough
with the smooth."

779
00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:24.372
MAY 30TH. 1984

780
00:51:24.456 --> 00:51:26.458
Special programming
about the annular solar eclipse…

781
00:51:26.541 --> 00:51:28.210
ALL OF MEXICO WATCHED THE ECLIPSE!

782
00:51:28.293 --> 00:51:29.628
…for May 30th. 1984. at 9:00 a.m.

783
00:51:29.711 --> 00:51:32.464
THE MOON BETWEEN APOGEE AND PERIGEE

784
00:51:32.547 --> 00:51:34.424
This is a production

785
00:51:34.508 --> 00:51:37.052
of National Autonomous University
of Mexico Radio.

786
00:51:37.135 --> 00:51:40.222
Special edition
for the annular solar eclipse.

787
00:51:41.807 --> 00:51:43.100
ECLIPSE MOMENTARILY VISIBLE

788
00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:45.936
TODAY'S SOLAR SHOW

789
00:51:46.019 --> 00:51:50.357
This morning.
the annular solar eclipse over Mexico.

790
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.275
Scientists from all over the country

791
00:51:52.359 --> 00:51:56.530
got together
at exactly 9:29 and 47 seconds

792
00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:58.657
when the eclipse reached its peak.

793
00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:03.662
He was killed this afternoon.
with five shots in the back.

794
00:52:03.745 --> 00:52:05.622
one of which went through the heart.

795
00:52:06.206 --> 00:52:11.461
Today. Excélsior reports
that Buendía always carried a gun

796
00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:15.257
and used to say. "If they kill me.
it'll have to be from behind

797
00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:19.302
because if they attack me head-on.
I'll take some of them with me."

798
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:26.268
So. they called Zorrilla.
"They just killed Buendía."

799
00:52:27.018 --> 00:52:28.728
They called me over the radio.

800
00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:33.859
"F7-L1. make contact immediately.
Bring the Wasps to this address."

801
00:52:33.942 --> 00:52:35.277
"There's been a homicide."

802
00:52:35.777 --> 00:52:39.614
And that's when I said.
"Why are we going to see a homicide?"

803
00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:41.908
"It's an order. Let's go."

804
00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:45.078
The agents arrived quickly.
Zorrilla arrived a little later.

805
00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:46.621
but they arrived quickly

806
00:52:46.705 --> 00:52:48.957
and started speaking
to Juan Manuel Bautista.

807
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.168
-What is your name?
-Juan Manuel Bautista.

808
00:52:51.251 --> 00:52:52.794
-Did you work with Buendía?
-Yes.

809
00:52:52.878 --> 00:52:54.254
I was inside.

810
00:52:55.213 --> 00:52:59.634
I heard Juan Manuel Bautista
give them the same description.

811
00:52:59.718 --> 00:53:01.553
"He was tall. about 5'9''."

812
00:53:01.636 --> 00:53:03.305
"Dark complexion. thin mustache."

813
00:53:03.388 --> 00:53:05.432
"He had a crew cut."

814
00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:07.559
"Muscular. A guy from the coast."

815
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:21.448
The Federal Security Directorate
took files from the archive.

816
00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:26.036
I don't know how many files they took.
but I saw them taking them.

817
00:53:26.119 --> 00:53:29.915
Luis Soto was very upset and said.
"They're taking the files."

818
00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.837
JOURNALIST MURDERED

819
00:53:36.338 --> 00:53:37.714
The Feds are the Feds.

820
00:53:38.256 --> 00:53:40.717
We had orders. and we were more fierce.

821
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.886
The Feds have always been more respected.

822
00:53:42.969 --> 00:53:46.389
We gathered all the evidence
and spoke to the witnesses.

823
00:53:46.473 --> 00:53:49.059
So. when the murder occurred.

824
00:53:49.142 --> 00:53:52.520
the Federal Security Directorate
was the first thing I thought of.

825
00:53:52.604 --> 00:53:55.148
BUENDÍA'S MURDER WAS NOT POLITICAL

826
00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:03.156
Crimes of passion
are a common thing in the police work.

827
00:54:04.824 --> 00:54:08.536
But nobody believed that a lover

828
00:54:09.162 --> 00:54:10.872
would pull on his trench coat

829
00:54:11.456 --> 00:54:13.333
and shoot him in the back.

830
00:54:15.335 --> 00:54:17.170
That's what a professional does.

831
00:54:18.588 --> 00:54:19.881
SECOND SHOT

832
00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:21.299
THIRD AND FOURTH SHOTS

833
00:54:22.008 --> 00:54:24.094
EXAMINATION OF THE CRIME SCENE

834
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:28.431
None of the facts
nor the nature of the crime

835
00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:30.684
were consistent with a crime of passion.

836
00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:32.352
PRIVATE NETWORK COLUMN ANALYSIS

837
00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:34.521
BEFORE HIS MURDER

838
00:54:36.147 --> 00:54:38.566
We jumped into action as a union

839
00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:42.112
to hold a demonstration the following day.

840
00:54:42.195 --> 00:54:44.072
which was very well attended.

841
00:54:44.155 --> 00:54:47.993
The union made itself heard.

842
00:54:48.076 --> 00:54:50.412
MANUEL BUENDÍA FOUNDATION

843
00:54:50.495 --> 00:54:54.958
We held a short rally
at the Ministry of the Interior.

844
00:54:55.709 --> 00:55:00.255
asking to speak with Mr. Manuel Bartlett.

845
00:55:00.922 --> 00:55:02.424
Why are you closing it?

846
00:55:02.924 --> 00:55:06.219
-This is a public office.
-I don't get why this is closed.

847
00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:10.098
Justice!

848
00:55:10.181 --> 00:55:12.017
The secretary of the interior.

849
00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.686
Manuel Bartlett…

850
00:55:14.769 --> 00:55:17.272
Tell him the Union of Journalists is here.

851
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:21.318
The secretary of the interior.

852
00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:24.904
"The secretary isn't here.
He's very busy."

853
00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:26.072
"We'll wait."

854
00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:31.494
Two seconds later. by some miracle.

855
00:55:31.578 --> 00:55:34.247
Manuel Bartlett appeared and met with us.

856
00:55:35.206 --> 00:55:40.378
We told him we were angry

857
00:55:40.462 --> 00:55:42.964
because there were no results.

858
00:55:43.798 --> 00:55:48.511
And he told us. "I will get involved."

859
00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:51.222
Mexico's future is at stake.

860
00:55:51.765 --> 00:55:53.767
and Mexicans want this.

861
00:55:54.267 --> 00:55:56.144
True democracy.

862
00:55:56.895 --> 00:55:59.189
Honesty and good faith.

863
00:55:59.272 --> 00:56:03.610
Manuel Bartlett Díaz
is an impressive political figure.

864
00:56:04.194 --> 00:56:08.031
Manuel Bartlett Díaz
has been everything but president.

865
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:12.660
Manuel Bartlett
is the type of Mexican politician

866
00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:16.331
from the old PRI.
where the idea of the state

867
00:56:16.414 --> 00:56:19.501
was different from what we have now.

868
00:56:20.335 --> 00:56:23.338
And that's what defines him.

869
00:56:23.421 --> 00:56:25.924
SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR
1982–1988

870
00:56:26.007 --> 00:56:28.176
SECRETARY OF EDUCATION
1988–1992

871
00:56:28.259 --> 00:56:30.470
GOVERNOR OF PUEBLA
1993–1999

872
00:56:30.553 --> 00:56:33.056
SENATOR/LABOR PARTY
2012–2018

873
00:56:33.139 --> 00:56:34.933
DIRECTOR
FEDERAL ELECTRICITY COMMISSION. 2018

874
00:56:35.016 --> 00:56:37.352
De la Madrid seemed terribly worried

875
00:56:38.311 --> 00:56:40.313
about keeping the country afloat.

876
00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:45.193
and Manuel Bartlett seemed
terribly worried about becoming president.

877
00:56:46.736 --> 00:56:50.782
How did Manuel Bartlett
suggest to the president

878
00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:55.537
that Zorrilla should
take over the investigation?

879
00:56:58.164 --> 00:57:02.794
The investigation conducted by
the authorities would have been pointless.

880
00:57:02.877 --> 00:57:05.255
Rogelio Hernández
played an important role.

881
00:57:05.338 --> 00:57:07.841
without ever having met Manuel Buendía.

882
00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:10.093
Because he was

883
00:57:10.176 --> 00:57:15.932
a tireless advocate for justice.

884
00:57:16.015 --> 00:57:17.058
ROGELIO HERNÁNDEZ
JOURNALIST

885
00:57:17.142 --> 00:57:21.938
First. we looked
at Buendía's friends and enemies.

886
00:57:22.856 --> 00:57:27.527
One person stood out.
His very good friend. Zorrilla.

887
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:33.408
Zorrilla was Manuel Buendía's buddy.

888
00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:40.707
They even went shooting together
at Military Camp 1.

889
00:57:42.876 --> 00:57:46.629
I have nothing bad to say about Zorrilla

890
00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:50.008
before the Federal Security Directorate.

891
00:57:50.091 --> 00:57:54.637
He was the ambitious type.
lacking in morals.

892
00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:59.642
disloyal. crooked. unpleasant. unsettling.

893
00:58:00.810 --> 00:58:02.020
but that's it.

894
00:58:02.103 --> 00:58:05.773
But he went crazy
at the Federal Security Directorate.

895
00:58:05.857 --> 00:58:12.322
He once told me. and. again. I quote.

896
00:58:12.405 --> 00:58:14.699
"I'm going to make Manuel president."

897
00:58:14.782 --> 00:58:16.868
"And then. you'll know…"

898
00:58:20.246 --> 00:58:22.790
The Federal Security Directorate
played a huge role

899
00:58:22.874 --> 00:58:26.753
by breaking the law
and interfering with the investigation.

900
00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:31.841
I mean. there were signs

901
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:36.429
that suggested that they were involved.

902
00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:40.225
They had no reason
to take the files from the archive.

903
00:58:40.975 --> 00:58:43.937
Zorrilla once said privately.

904
00:58:45.438 --> 00:58:48.107
"Bartlett ordered us to take the files."

905
00:58:50.485 --> 00:58:55.073
Even back then. some journalists
accused Bartlett directly.

906
00:58:55.156 --> 00:59:00.328
He felt singled out. and that lit a spark.

907
00:59:00.411 --> 00:59:04.040
That's when they started
to investigate Zorrilla. I think.

908
00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:08.920
And everything
the DFS did. started to get exposed.

909
00:59:12.632 --> 00:59:17.470
Federal Security Directorate commanders
were the country's first drug lords.

910
00:59:17.554 --> 00:59:21.683
There was no distinction
between drug traffickers. organized crime.

911
00:59:21.766 --> 00:59:23.643
and the Federal Security Directorate.

912
00:59:23.726 --> 00:59:26.187
A well-known connection

913
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:29.607
is the protection
provided to the Guadalajara Cartel.

914
00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:33.069
The head of the cartel
was Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo.

915
00:59:33.152 --> 00:59:36.614
and Ernesto Fonseca.
also known as Don Neto.

916
00:59:36.698 --> 00:59:38.992
and Rafael Caro Quintero were members.

917
00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:44.038
These were the connections
that Manuel Buendía was following.

918
00:59:46.291 --> 00:59:49.002
What was taken from Buendía's archive?

919
00:59:49.877 --> 00:59:54.716
Everything he had collected
about drug trafficking.

920
00:59:56.342 --> 00:59:58.094
Here's a very interesting anecdote.

921
00:59:59.178 --> 01:00:01.931
José Antonio Zorrilla told the Ministry.

922
01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:04.517
"Look at us. We don't need a budget."

923
01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.312
Why? Because he had
a national web of corruption

924
01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:10.523
that brought in billions.

925
01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:16.112
Manuel took me to lunch and sternly said.

926
01:00:16.195 --> 01:00:20.074
"The Federal Security Directorate
is involved in drug trafficking."

927
01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:23.953
"Manuel. as a journalist.
you may think that.

928
01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:26.122
but it is a very serious accusation."

929
01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:29.584
"You don't know. but you do know. You do."

930
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.547
That was my last interview with him.

931
01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:38.092
three or four days before they killed him.

932
01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.554
Was Buendía wrong to trust Zorrilla?

933
01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:44.849
In my opinion. yes.

934
01:00:45.933 --> 01:00:50.521
He couldn't be friends with someone
he knew was protecting criminals.

935
01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:52.690
That is. if he knew about it.

936
01:00:56.527 --> 01:01:00.740
For months. or maybe even a year.

937
01:01:01.574 --> 01:01:03.951
they've been keeping the case file hidden.

938
01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:05.828
Nothing has been done.

939
01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.246
They lost everything.

940
01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.248
They lost his clothes. Why?

941
01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:13.002
How is it possible to lose everything
in the investigation of this magnitude?

942
01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:16.339
LIBERTY

943
01:01:16.422 --> 01:01:20.009
Will my husband's murderer go unpunished?

944
01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.514
I saw how things were developing.

945
01:01:24.597 --> 01:01:27.934
and I thought.
"Something big is going to happen here."

946
01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:34.065
Then Zorrilla showed up
at my office and said.

947
01:01:34.148 --> 01:01:37.944
"I've come to say farewell."

948
01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:39.779
"Where are you going?"

949
01:01:40.279 --> 01:01:45.118
"The secretary has appointed me
as a representative back home.

950
01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.953
and then I'll become a governor."

951
01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:54.877
At that point. there were at least
four investigations into the Buendía case.

952
01:01:55.586 --> 01:01:58.297
Three official ones.
and one conducted by journalists.

953
01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:01.175
And all of them pointed to Zorrilla.

954
01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:09.392
Even though he denies it.
that's why Bartlett

955
01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.353
got him out of Hidalgo.

956
01:02:13.354 --> 01:02:15.690
and told him to leave the country.

957
01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:18.860
And Antonio Zorrilla Pérez went to Spain.

958
01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:21.529
BUENDÍA INVESTIGATION
HELP!

959
01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:43.676
We will not close ongoing investigations.

960
01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.304
Especially in the case

961
01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:50.057
of the murder
of renowned journalist Manuel Buendía

962
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:52.977
that took place five years ago.

963
01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:56.481
We will double up our efforts.

964
01:02:57.023 --> 01:03:01.068
This week.
Mexico City's district attorney general

965
01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:04.489
and the special prosecutor
appointed to this case

966
01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:09.619
will present an overview
of the investigation to the public.

967
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.875
Yesterday.
the results of the investigation

968
01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:18.961
into the murder
of Manuel Buendía were released.

969
01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:22.632
That's why we are speaking with
Mr. Ignacio Morales Lechuga.

970
01:03:23.382 --> 01:03:26.427
who is Mexico City's
district attorney general.

971
01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:31.057
When the special prosecutor's office
began their work

972
01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.810
under Miguel Ángel García Domínguez.

973
01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:38.731
they compiled a set of 298 hypotheses.

974
01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:43.986
based on Manuel Buendía's
newspaper columns.

975
01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:48.991
and 24 that were based
on personal and family relationships.

976
01:03:49.867 --> 01:03:53.371
From these hypotheses.
clues were collected

977
01:03:53.454 --> 01:03:57.708
using a methodology. system. and structure

978
01:03:57.792 --> 01:04:00.461
developed
by the special prosecutor's office.

979
01:04:00.962 --> 01:04:04.423
Is it prudent. or even possible.

980
01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:07.593
to solve this case
before its sixth anniversary?

981
01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:14.267
All I can say is… hopefully.

982
01:04:15.643 --> 01:04:18.896
Why are you making this statement now?

983
01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:24.193
Because I wasn't formally mandated
to do so before.

984
01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:27.446
What is your statement
regarding the homicide?

985
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.825
We're here to provide information
for the investigation.

986
01:04:30.908 --> 01:04:32.577
Ask your questions in the office.

987
01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.538
Where have you been
for the last four years?

988
01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:40.418
I've been… to many places.

989
01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:41.377
Like what. sir?

990
01:04:49.635 --> 01:04:53.973
TUESDAY. JUNE 13th. 1989

991
01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:05.443
I received a phone call
confirming his location.

992
01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:11.782
I heard distinct gunfire
in the background.

993
01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:16.704
So I said. "Stop shooting."

994
01:05:16.787 --> 01:05:21.042
"But he's shooting at us."
"Let him. but don't you shoot."

995
01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:25.671
He was in his bedroom.

996
01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:28.966
I went up the stairs. towards his bedroom.

997
01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:33.930
I took the stairs.
and I saw the door open.

998
01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:36.182
and the barrel of a gun appeared.

999
01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:39.352
I said. "Zorrilla.
I'm the district attorney general."

1000
01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:40.311
"Don't shoot."

1001
01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:44.565
"I'm unarmed." I shouted.

1002
01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:48.986
So. he opened the door. and I entered.
He pointed the gun at me.

1003
01:05:49.862 --> 01:05:52.615
He kept threatening to kill me.

1004
01:05:52.698 --> 01:05:54.659
That's when the phone rang.

1005
01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:59.956
I went to answer it. but he said. "No!"
He answered it. while holding the gun.

1006
01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:03.751
CORNERED

1007
01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:10.633
The president called me and said.

1008
01:06:10.716 --> 01:06:12.343
"Go to the city hall

1009
01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:16.722
because there's a very big problem."

1010
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:22.311
That's when I found out
that Ponce Rojas and Nacho Morales

1011
01:06:23.604 --> 01:06:28.401
wanted to detain Zorrilla.
and that Zorrilla had them at gunpoint.

1012
01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:31.570
Finally. after three hours.

1013
01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.365
he took his coat and his hat.

1014
01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:36.242
and we left.

1015
01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:40.830
We noticed
that he had a gun behind his back.

1016
01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:46.419
I said. "I'll buy you dinner."

1017
01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:50.256
That's what I said.
"Let's all have dinner together."

1018
01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:55.177
We are outside
the District Attorney General's Office.

1019
01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:59.557
where today.
Mr. Zorrilla Pérez is being interrogated.

1020
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:04.061
accused of allegedly murdering
Manuel Buendía.

1021
01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:07.523
I waited at the District Attorney
General's Office.

1022
01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:11.986
and Nacho Morales arrived with Zorrilla.

1023
01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:18.284
And when I greeted Zorrilla.

1024
01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:24.915
I gave him a hug and took the gun
he was hiding behind his back.

1025
01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:28.377
I said. "Forgive me. buddy.
but I'll be here.

1026
01:07:28.461 --> 01:07:30.796
and I don't tolerate
these sorts of things."

1027
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.425
I didn't actually see the interrogation.

1028
01:07:36.093 --> 01:07:41.348
Nacho put on a movie about a journalist…

1029
01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:47.271
an old movie about a journalist called--
some movie.

1030
01:07:47.354 --> 01:07:49.940
I don't know what's happening in Mexico.

1031
01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:51.776
Nothing happens in Mexico!

1032
01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:55.362
I can't believe this news to end the year.

1033
01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:57.865
The news is like a rabbit.

1034
01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:00.493
It jumps out where you least expect it.

1035
01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.495
You have to catch it mid-flight.

1036
01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.538
He even ordered dinner.

1037
01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:07.958
With everyone there.
it felt like a family gathering.

1038
01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:11.670
I told Nacho.
"I'm going to interrogate Zorrilla."

1039
01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:15.424
"Those are my orders."
I interrogated him for two or three hours.

1040
01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:18.803
He said. "Look. you can kill me."

1041
01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:20.971
"It wasn't me."

1042
01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:24.308
"I know who it was. but I won't tell you."

1043
01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:28.938
"But. Javier. I'll take the fall for it."

1044
01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:31.440
And he did.

1045
01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.362
So. they detained Zorrilla.

1046
01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:40.324
but they didn't touch
his money or his ranches

1047
01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:42.868
or any of his property.

1048
01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.203
In exchange for what?

1049
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:47.289
For turning himself in
and for his silence.

1050
01:08:47.373 --> 01:08:49.917
Zorrilla never spoke about the case.

1051
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:50.960
ZORRILLA GOES DOWN

1052
01:08:51.043 --> 01:08:53.087
ZORRILLA CAPTURED
CHARGES PILE UP

1053
01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:55.965
NO EXIT FOR ZORRILLA
GUILTY

1054
01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:58.050
That's when I started working in film.

1055
01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:01.846
-What parts did you play?
-The bad guy. the villain.

1056
01:09:03.931 --> 01:09:05.349
Tell your pigs

1057
01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:08.561
that there isn't enough money
in the world to buy me.

1058
01:09:09.061 --> 01:09:11.856
I'll keep reporting you until I die.

1059
01:09:14.275 --> 01:09:18.154
Today we are joined by Dr. Dela Balza.
the renowned criminologist.

1060
01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:20.531
I always did action films.

1061
01:09:20.614 --> 01:09:22.950
I was always the thug or the cop.

1062
01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:28.038
We arrived at a studio
where there was a news reporter.

1063
01:09:28.122 --> 01:09:30.541
and we shot everyone.

1064
01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:32.626
even the guys that do the lights.

1065
01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:34.503
I killed a lot of people in movies.

1066
01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:36.338
Later I played an assassin.

1067
01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:39.675
A skilled one.
because I took out a lot of people.

1068
01:09:44.638 --> 01:09:48.809
I was in a hotel. with a girl

1069
01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:53.731
when my mom called and said.
"What did you do. Juan Rafael?"

1070
01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:54.940
I got scared.

1071
01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.318
"I didn't do anything. Why?"

1072
01:09:57.401 --> 01:10:00.237
"They came to your house
and broke down your doors."

1073
01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:02.615
"They beat your dog unconscious."

1074
01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:03.991
"They stole everything you had."

1075
01:10:04.074 --> 01:10:06.285
WE FELL INTO A TRAP.
SAYS MORO'S MOTHER

1076
01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:09.288
"They have orders to turn you in dead."

1077
01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:13.751
"And they will say that you admitted
to killing Buendía before dying."

1078
01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:15.878
"So. be careful. son."

1079
01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:20.216
I got scared after that.

1080
01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:23.427
I said. "Mom. find me a lawyer
and file for protection."

1081
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:25.387
POLICE CAPTURE JUAN RAFAEL MORO ÁVILA

1082
01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:28.182
I was a cop. I knew what was going on.

1083
01:10:28.265 --> 01:10:30.851
I ran away.
and I was playing games with the police.

1084
01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:32.144
They were dumb.

1085
01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:35.314
"Where's my protection?"

1086
01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:38.901
When she said she had it.
I came back immediately.

1087
01:10:38.984 --> 01:10:40.361
I left my guns.

1088
01:10:40.444 --> 01:10:43.197
I was well-armed.
so in case they were going to kill me.

1089
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.490
they would die too.

1090
01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:50.120
I turned myself in. unarmed.

1091
01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:52.665
Then I saw they had snipers.

1092
01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:57.169
shooters. and a swarm of police.

1093
01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:00.381
They put me against the car.
"What's up? Easy."

1094
01:11:00.464 --> 01:11:03.717
I was a cop.
I knew I had a clear conscience.

1095
01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:06.553
I turned myself in.
They took me in the squad car.

1096
01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:11.725
The District Attorney General's Office

1097
01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:18.357
will bring Juan Rafael Moro Ávila
before criminal court 34 today

1098
01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:23.779
on the charge of being
an accomplice to homicide.

1099
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:27.950
They threatened my family.

1100
01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:29.034
BUENDÍA'S MURDERER CAUGHT

1101
01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:32.162
They detained my family.
and were using them to pressure me.

1102
01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:35.124
That's why I agreed to a press conference.
But I never incriminated myself.

1103
01:11:35.207 --> 01:11:36.917
I DIDN'T KILL BUENDÍA!

1104
01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:38.419
I didn't incriminate anyone.

1105
01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:41.297
The day they killed the journalist.

1106
01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:46.760
Juan Moro Ávila. then head
of the Special Motorcycle Brigade.

1107
01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:51.056
was at the Federal Security
Directorate offices

1108
01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.976
when he was informed that that afternoon.

1109
01:11:54.059 --> 01:11:58.605
a special operation called "News"
would be taking place.

1110
01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:00.149
Special Operation News?

1111
01:12:00.232 --> 01:12:02.568
Everything he's saying isn't true.

1112
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.989
That bastard
is reading my whole statement!

1113
01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:11.368
Finally. I said.
"If you're gonna pressure me. fine."

1114
01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:14.038
"I helped the killer."
But I didn't know who he was.

1115
01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:17.291
"We'll say Chocorrol jumped on your bike.

1116
01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:18.375
CHOCORROL WAS THE SHOOTER

1117
01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:21.545
and you thought he was a DFS agent.
so you went to investigate…

1118
01:12:21.628 --> 01:12:25.007
…and after a while.
we'll say that he killed him.

1119
01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:26.592
and we'll get you out of trouble."

1120
01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:27.843
"THEY BETRAYED ME." CRIES MORO

1121
01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:29.762
They were trying to blame Chocorrol.

1122
01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:32.890
It was all political.
They had me and my family in a bind.

1123
01:12:32.973 --> 01:12:36.393
We were all trapped. I said.
"If this is the only way out. fine."

1124
01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:41.648
They asked me
to report to the address. which I did.

1125
01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:48.906
The commander ordered me to comb the area.
I got off the bike to get instructions.

1126
01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:50.699
I got on the bike.

1127
01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:53.994
I started my bike
to go comb the area by myself.

1128
01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:57.831
when Mr. Chocorrol jumped on the back.

1129
01:12:58.457 --> 01:13:01.001
I recognized him from the office.

1130
01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:03.837
I thought he was also
a Federal Security agent.

1131
01:13:04.421 --> 01:13:07.716
We took off. and he said.
"Go to the right. go to the left."

1132
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.761
I said. "Let's check. We're after
someone who fits this description."

1133
01:13:10.844 --> 01:13:15.391
I didn't realize what I was doing.

1134
01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.685
I was collaborating in a homicide.

1135
01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:21.980
The District Attorney General's Office

1136
01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:26.443
revealed details about the death
of José Luis Ochoa Alonso.

1137
01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:28.028
also known as "Chocorrol."

1138
01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:32.116
Yesterday. Moro Ávila named Chocorrol

1139
01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:35.285
as the person responsible
for killing Manuel Buendía.

1140
01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:37.996
I'll fully cooperate
and tell you everything.

1141
01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.999
I love journalists.
I have journalistic inclinations.

1142
01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.460
and I've always taken care of reporters.

1143
01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:44.795
I love you all.

1144
01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:46.630
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!

1145
01:13:46.713 --> 01:13:48.882
IMAGINE THE ONES WHO DON'T LOVE US!

1146
01:13:56.598 --> 01:13:58.308
Around 7:30 at night.

1147
01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:03.230
Mr. José Antonio Zorrilla Pérez
arrived at Mexico City's Northern Jail.

1148
01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:06.150
Mr. Zorrilla was traveling in a white car.

1149
01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:11.530
which was part of a convoy
of 15 judicial police vehicles.

1150
01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.199
He shouted that he was innocent
to some journalists.

1151
01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.910
One of them
managed to stick their recorder

1152
01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:21.039
into the squad car Zorrilla Pérez
arrived in and obtained this audio.

1153
01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:24.626
Are you guilty or innocent. Mr. Zorrilla?

1154
01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:27.004
Innocent. I need the press to help me.

1155
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.465
Thank you.

1156
01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.594
As a result of the investigations

1157
01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:36.430
and his recent conduct.

1158
01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:43.353
José Antonio Zorrilla Pérez
is presumed responsible

1159
01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:47.649
for the homicide
of Manuel Buendía Tellezgirón.

1160
01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:50.986
as the mastermind behind that act.

1161
01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:54.615
NO ESCAPE FOR ZORRILLA

1162
01:14:54.698 --> 01:14:57.534
Based on the evidence.

1163
01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:03.582
Juan Rafael Moro Ávila
was the one who shot Manuel Buendía.

1164
01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:06.293
MORO IN JAIL
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS?

1165
01:15:06.376 --> 01:15:09.755
ZORRILLA AND MORO
UNDOUBTEDLY KILLED BUENDÍA

1166
01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:12.299
ZORRILLA GAVE THE ORDER

1167
01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:14.968
MORO SHOT

1168
01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:17.221
BUENDÍA
CASE CLOSED

1169
01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:23.185
We felt that
Manuel Buendía's investigation was

1170
01:15:23.268 --> 01:15:25.229
quite typical for the police.

1171
01:15:25.312 --> 01:15:29.608
With crazy stories.

1172
01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:32.819
and then the biker guy

1173
01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:37.199
who was the grandson
of President Ávila Camacho.

1174
01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:42.454
Everything is overdramatized.
and doesn't lead to the truth.

1175
01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:47.751
We supposed that they would cover up
the real motive.

1176
01:15:48.418 --> 01:15:54.007
But we didn't imagine
that we were on the cusp of a story

1177
01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:56.176
that would engulf us.

1178
01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.263
It was the emergence of the cartels.

1179
01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:02.599
One month before the murder.

1180
01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:05.519
a report was published

1181
01:16:05.602 --> 01:16:09.690
by the bishops from the South Pacific

1182
01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:12.776
which said that they were seeing

1183
01:16:13.485 --> 01:16:19.199
drug traffickers
infiltrating state institutions.

1184
01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:23.870
Manuel Buendía picked up the story
and published two articles about that.

1185
01:16:23.954 --> 01:16:27.874
NATIONAL SECURITY

1186
01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.339
"National Security."

1187
01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:38.135
Excélsior. May 14th. 1984.

1188
01:16:38.218 --> 01:16:39.428
By Manuel Buendía.

1189
01:16:40.178 --> 01:16:44.683
Drug trafficking
has evidently picked up in Mexico

1190
01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:47.269
since 1982.

1191
01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:52.399
And this can't be achieved
without help from the inside.

1192
01:16:52.899 --> 01:16:54.818
They say that in this dirty business.

1193
01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:59.197
there is direct or indirect complicity

1194
01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:03.910
of the top state and federal officials.

1195
01:17:05.329 --> 01:17:09.750
Based on what the bishops have reported.
and also other sources.

1196
01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:13.503
this is a matter of national security.

1197
01:17:14.087 --> 01:17:16.715
THE PROGRESSIVE. APRIL. 1985
WHO KILLED MANUEL BUENDÍA?

1198
01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:19.593
A MEXICAN MYSTERY
BY MATTHEW ROTHSCHILD

1199
01:17:22.262 --> 01:17:24.973
"TO KILL ME. THEY WILL HAVE
TO SHOOT ME IN THE BACK."'

1200
01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:26.308
WHO KILLED MANUEL BUENDÍA

1201
01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:32.522
That was a major piece
that Unomásuno did in its Sunday section.

1202
01:17:33.523 --> 01:17:36.860
He thought it was either
by people who wanted to keep

1203
01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:42.616
Manuel Buendía from revealing connections
to the drug traffickers. to the cartel.

RUSSELL BARTLEY
HISTORIAN

1205
01:17:44.117 --> 01:17:47.704
Or it was CIA. it was the US government.
trying to prevent…

1206
01:17:49.706 --> 01:17:50.791
things they were into

1207
01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:53.877
that had to do with drug trafficking.
the Contras. and crime.

1208
01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:59.132
The bodies. found wrapped in plastic
at a ranch 100 miles from Guadalajara.

1209
01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:00.967
were badly decomposed.

1210
01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:04.429
Enrique Camarena was investigating
drug trafficking in Mexico

1211
01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:07.683
when he was kidnapped
near the US consulate in Guadalajara.

1212
01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:10.977
He was tortured. and two days later.
murdered by his captors.

1213
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:14.064
believed to be drug dealers
angry at Camarena's interference.

1214
01:18:14.147 --> 01:18:17.526
The two men the US government thinks
ordered the Camarena murder.

1215
01:18:17.609 --> 01:18:21.863
and are eager to try.
are drug kingpins are Rafael Caro Quintero

1216
01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:23.657
and Ernesto Fonseca.

1217
01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:25.951
They are already in prison in Mexico.

1218
01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:29.287
All of a sudden. my phone rang.

1219
01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:32.791
They asked me if I was Jesús Esquivel.

1220
01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:36.670
I said. "Yes. Who's calling?"

1221
01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:39.464
He said. "I'm Héctor Berrellez."

1222
01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:43.760
I was in charge of investigating
the murder of Kiki Camarena.

1223
01:18:44.761 --> 01:18:47.389
What he told me would change history.

1224
01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:53.729
The story to cover up Kiki's murder

1225
01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:57.899
and to cover up
the CIA's complicity in Kiki's murder…

1226
01:18:57.983 --> 01:18:59.109
HÉCTOR BERRELLEZ
DEA

1227
01:18:59.192 --> 01:19:01.695
…is to say that Kiki
was killed by the drug lords

1228
01:19:01.778 --> 01:19:05.532
for the biggest marijuana seizure
in the history of law enforcement.

1229
01:19:05.615 --> 01:19:06.658
Over 10.000 tons.

1230
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:11.663
That is a complete fabrication.

1231
01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:16.084
Camarena did not participate
in the Buffalo raids.

1232
01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.921
One of the things Berrellez told me was.

1233
01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:22.132
when he took over the investigation.

1234
01:19:22.215 --> 01:19:24.301
the first thing he did was

1235
01:19:24.384 --> 01:19:28.847
he took all of Kiki's belongings
from the DEA office in Guadalajara.

1236
01:19:29.973 --> 01:19:36.354
And the first thing he saw
was Kiki Camarena's planner.

1237
01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:39.983
The planner
had Buendía's phone number in it.

1238
01:19:41.985 --> 01:19:46.448
Héctor Berrellez and the DEA
told us also about that connection.

1239
01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:49.993
And. supposedly. they had met once.

1240
01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:52.245
So we knew that then.

1241
01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:55.415
Well. back then. Manuel Buendía

1242
01:19:56.082 --> 01:20:00.420
was visited by Javier Vázquez.
a reporter out of Veracruz.

1243
01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:05.592
The reporter told Manuel Buendía
that he had uncovered a ranch

1244
01:20:06.718 --> 01:20:07.552
in Veracruz

1245
01:20:08.261 --> 01:20:10.889
that the DFS was protecting

1246
01:20:11.681 --> 01:20:15.894
and that the ranch
belonged to Rafael Caro Quintero.

1247
01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:20.065
Zorrilla Pérez told Manuel Buendía.

1248
01:20:20.565 --> 01:20:23.026
"Don't write any of it.
Please. Leave that alone."

1249
01:20:23.109 --> 01:20:23.985
"That is…"

1250
01:20:24.069 --> 01:20:26.196
"Don't even go there.
That's a big secret."

1251
01:20:26.279 --> 01:20:28.448
The most
American investigators are hoping for

1252
01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:32.661
is that those responsible
will be arrested and tried in Mexico.

1253
01:20:32.744 --> 01:20:36.540
So. my first objective
was to find witnesses.

1254
01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:40.752
And ironically enough.
they identified an American agent to me.

1255
01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:44.047
LAWRENCE HARRISON
CIA COLLABORATOR. 1968–1985

1256
01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:46.675
He was a guy who.

1257
01:20:48.051 --> 01:20:49.094
as far as I know.

1258
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:54.099
was a drinking buddy
of the Guadalajara group.

1259
01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.686
The November of 1983.

1260
01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:02.566
he's living in Ernesto Fonseca's house.
for crying out loud.

1261
01:21:02.649 --> 01:21:06.194
He's married. and he has his own house.
but he's managing

1262
01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:07.821
the electronic communications.

1263
01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:10.532
the radio communications
that the cartel had there.

1264
01:21:13.493 --> 01:21:17.122
Who knew anything a bout Harrison?
He was a very complicated human being.

1265
01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:21.543
He was deep cover.
and he was his own handler.

1266
01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:25.505
Obviously. he reported to somebody.

1267
01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:31.511
A lot of his reporting was actually
to Mexican intelligence people.

1268
01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:36.099
He had a superior.
superiors in DFS. and so on.

1269
01:21:36.182 --> 01:21:39.019
And I thought. "This is strange."

1270
01:21:39.102 --> 01:21:42.355
"An American person working for the DFS?"

1271
01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:44.024
THIS IS THE FEDERAL SECURITY DIRECTORATE

1272
01:21:44.107 --> 01:21:47.444
A tiger is a powerful animal
that doesn't run from danger.

1273
01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:48.987
It attacks head-on.

1274
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:52.908
It prefers to act in silence.
and it sees what others don't.

1275
01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:57.078
This is what a DFS agent should be like.

1276
01:21:57.162 --> 01:22:00.165
I went through a lot of hardship
to try to get to this guy.

1277
01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:03.501
So finally. I got him on the phone.
and I talked to him.

1278
01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:06.838
And he said.
"You don't know what you're dealing with."

1279
01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:08.840
"You're treading in very deep waters."

1280
01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:11.176
"You don't know
where you're going with this."

1281
01:22:11.259 --> 01:22:14.262
"I'm not hiding from you.
I'm hiding from my own agency now."

1282
01:22:14.346 --> 01:22:15.639
"I work for the CIA."

1283
01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:22.687
But when they came after him.
when it was clear they'd do him in.

1284
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:27.609
one way or another.
he said. "To hell with it."

1285
01:22:27.692 --> 01:22:31.196
You know. that's when he let us record
and photograph and…

1286
01:22:33.406 --> 01:22:36.242
This is an interview
conducted by Russell Bartley

1287
01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:38.912
with Lawrence Victor Harrison

1288
01:22:39.412 --> 01:22:42.248
at his residence in Riverside. California.

1289
01:22:42.874 --> 01:22:47.796
on Thursday. June 18th. 2009.

1290
01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:51.591
And. you know.
you and I had a discussion about that.

1291
01:22:51.675 --> 01:22:55.261
But… the person who was blamed for it.

1292
01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:57.889
the person who publicized it
was Manuel Buendía.

1293
01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:01.643
Where he got the lists. I don't know.
He said he got them from Zorrilla.

1294
01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.229
Then Zorrilla later on said.

1295
01:23:04.312 --> 01:23:06.982
"I had to take care of him.
He found something out."

1296
01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:10.527
"Something that I can't tell you
what it is. but it's very important."

1297
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:14.072
It certainly wasn't the credential.
Everybody already knew about that.

1298
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:17.492
It wasn't Mertins or anything like that.

1299
01:23:17.575 --> 01:23:18.994
It was something else.

1300
01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.579
Why did they kill Buendía?

1301
01:23:22.414 --> 01:23:27.252
Buendía? Because he had seen
about these airstrips.

1302
01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:30.130
That's what they were pissed about.
That was the whole thing.

1303
01:23:30.213 --> 01:23:31.381
That was their problem.

1304
01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:34.592
You now see partly.
a part of what's happening.

1305
01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:39.639
You don't have the grounding.
but you're getting close.

1306
01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:42.058
You've been around. talking to people.

1307
01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:44.310
But if you're not able
to put that together.

1308
01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:46.354
you should see we're running it.

1309
01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.898
We've been running it for a long ti--

1310
01:23:50.817 --> 01:23:54.696
When I tell you these things.
I tell you because I saw them. you know.

1311
01:23:57.574 --> 01:24:00.035
And when he was here. he said. "Listen."

1312
01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:02.954
"We have a secret operation.
We're running guns

1313
01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:07.083
into Central and South America.
many to the Contras. through Mexico."

1314
01:24:07.834 --> 01:24:11.046
"And we're also bringing in
tons of cocaine."

1315
01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:13.798
"We are funding
the Nicaraguan war with coke."

1316
01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:17.218
And I said. "Who's 'we'?"
He said. "Oliver North. Félix Rodríguez."

1317
01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:19.596
OLIVER NORTH
US NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER

1318
01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:26.770
Félix Rodríguez is a dark person…

1319
01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:34.611
with some incredible stories
in Latin America that seem like fiction.

1320
01:24:34.694 --> 01:24:37.447
Starting with the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

1321
01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:42.577
And eventually.
the assassination of Che Guevara

1322
01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:43.787
in Bolivia.

1323
01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:47.290
They sent him to Mexico

1324
01:24:47.373 --> 01:24:53.630
because there were investigations
by the US Congress

1325
01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:58.343
about the weapons
the Contras were receiving.

1326
01:24:58.426 --> 01:25:02.472
Would it be fair to say.
Mr. Rodríguez. that this operation

1327
01:25:02.555 --> 01:25:04.891
was controlled
by the United States government?

1328
01:25:04.974 --> 01:25:06.392
I didn't consider that.

1329
01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:07.936
I considered that

1330
01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:13.775
Colonel North had the interest
to help the Nicaraguan freedom fighter.

1331
01:25:13.858 --> 01:25:15.944
When you lose your country.
you feel abandoned.

1332
01:25:16.027 --> 01:25:18.530
and have nobody to go to.
if anybody comes to your help

1333
01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:19.989
under those circumstances.

1334
01:25:20.073 --> 01:25:22.408
it would be immoral
for me not to go to him

1335
01:25:22.492 --> 01:25:24.452
or help him in any way or form.

1336
01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:28.665
You are a former CIA agent. are you not?

1337
01:25:28.748 --> 01:25:30.166
-Yes. sir.
-All right.

1338
01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:34.170
Kiki Camarena was targeted

1339
01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:40.218
because he found out
about the Veracruz ranch.

1340
01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:44.430
They feared
that he knew about the training camps

1341
01:25:44.514 --> 01:25:48.685
and he knew of the collusion
of the DFS. the CIA with the narcos.

1342
01:25:48.768 --> 01:25:54.232
I mean. you start putting pieces
of the puzzle together. and you see it.

1343
01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:58.987
We killed Buendía.
We killed Camarena. We. the Americans.

1344
01:26:02.407 --> 01:26:05.577
The CIA. to this day.
feels they did nothing wrong.

1345
01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:10.790
The war against communism is first.
above in priorities than the drug war.

1346
01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:13.042
I'm DEA. and I'm saying. "You're wrong."

1347
01:26:13.126 --> 01:26:15.295
To me. you're destroying our country.

1348
01:26:15.795 --> 01:26:18.715
You're destroying our youth.
and you guys are drug dealers.

1349
01:26:18.798 --> 01:26:20.258
GEORGE BUSH
CIA DIRECTOR

1350
01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:22.218
We may not be talking about security.

1351
01:26:22.302 --> 01:26:28.308
We're talking about regime goals
and objectives in the world. Policy.

1352
01:26:32.103 --> 01:26:36.858
What has always been on our minds

1353
01:26:36.941 --> 01:26:38.693
is. "Who?"

1354
01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:43.406
Zorrilla had
no personal issues with Manuel.

1355
01:26:43.489 --> 01:26:47.994
The issues were coming
from higher up. from top officials.

1356
01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:54.500
When I left court.
I ran into a guy with blue eyes who said.

1357
01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:57.295
"Moro. you didn't kill Buendía."

1358
01:26:57.378 --> 01:26:58.421
"Of course not."

1359
01:26:58.504 --> 01:27:01.257
"I know who did it. It wasn't you."

1360
01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:05.595
He said he knew a guy.

1361
01:27:06.971 --> 01:27:10.350
Luis Sayas. who worked as a hit man.

1362
01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:16.272
Sayas said he had a .38 caliber gun.

1363
01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:19.359
According to him.
they saw Buendía leave and said.

1364
01:27:19.442 --> 01:27:22.278
"That's Buendía."

1365
01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:26.324
He crossed the street.
shot him at point-blank range

1366
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:27.867
and ran away.

1367
01:27:27.951 --> 01:27:32.163
When they left.
they got orders for another job.

1368
01:27:32.872 --> 01:27:35.041
To rob a jewelry store…

1369
01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:39.420
A jewelry store in Acapulco
with a lot of gold.

1370
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:44.092
Upon arrival they got into a shooting.
and Luis Sayas was killed. They shot him.

1371
01:27:44.175 --> 01:27:48.429
They filled him with a lot of bullets
and dumped him in a common grave.

1372
01:27:49.472 --> 01:27:51.224
That's where Buendía's killer is.

1373
01:27:51.307 --> 01:27:53.851
AFTER SPENDING 18 YEARS IN PRISON.

1374
01:27:53.935 --> 01:27:57.063
JUAN RAFAEL MORO ÁVILA
WAS RELEASED IN FEBRUARY 2009

1375
01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:05.655
-Hello. Mr. Zorrilla.
-How are you?

1376
01:28:05.738 --> 01:28:08.449
I'm here to meet with you again.

1377
01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:11.911
-I hope we aren't bothering you.
-No. not at all.

1378
01:28:11.995 --> 01:28:13.121
-You sure?
-Of course.

1379
01:28:13.204 --> 01:28:14.831
I'm happy to hear that. sir.

1380
01:28:14.914 --> 01:28:17.959
I'm innocent. and so are my associates.

1381
01:28:18.042 --> 01:28:23.006
The authorities
need to investigate the matter.

1382
01:28:23.548 --> 01:28:27.885
I went to the crime scene
because Luis Soto called me.

1383
01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:30.305
I arrived quickly

1384
01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:33.182
because it was five minutes
away from my office.

1385
01:28:33.766 --> 01:28:37.145
I went quickly to see a friend

1386
01:28:37.228 --> 01:28:39.272
who I was told had been shot.

1387
01:28:40.023 --> 01:28:44.402
I went to help him
and see if I could save his life.

1388
01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:49.115
If that's a crime.
I would gladly do it again.

1389
01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:55.872
I'm convinced that it is a state crime.

1390
01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:59.959
Zorrilla is not guilty.

1391
01:29:00.043 --> 01:29:03.296
May Mr. Morales Lechuga forgive me

1392
01:29:03.379 --> 01:29:05.923
and the government
and whoever else as well.

1393
01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:08.092
but I questioned him.

1394
01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:09.469
I interrogated him.

1395
01:29:11.054 --> 01:29:14.432
And with all due respect.
I'm good at that.

1396
01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:16.601
AFTER 25 YEARS IN PRISON.

1397
01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:22.148
JOSÉ ANTONIO ZORRILLA PÉREZ
WAS PLACED UNDER HOUSE ARREST IN 2013

1398
01:29:22.231 --> 01:29:25.526
When the PRI
controlled Mexico in the '80s.

1399
01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:30.198
the code of silence was very important.
and it still is.

1400
01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:32.950
Before he dies.

1401
01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:37.080
Zorrilla should give
his version of the story.

1402
01:29:37.163 --> 01:29:38.498
Hopefully. he does.

1403
01:29:43.002 --> 01:29:44.670
History belongs to no one.

1404
01:29:45.505 --> 01:29:49.801
In that sense.
those of us who have lived for so long

1405
01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:54.430
should not keep our "secrets"
to ourselves.

1406
01:29:55.098 --> 01:29:59.268
especially if they concern matters
that affect the whole nation.

1407
01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:05.983
The history of Mexico in the 20th century

1408
01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:09.570
is the story
of the crumbling of the Mexican state

1409
01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:13.324
and the emergence
and consolidation of organized crime.

1410
01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:19.705
And in that story. we have to include
figures like Manuel Buendía.

1411
01:30:19.789 --> 01:30:23.501
Manuel Buendía. like other
great journalists of the 19th century.

1412
01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:25.711
returned to the liberal tradition.

1413
01:30:25.795 --> 01:30:28.589
though it's much more evolved
this century.

1414
01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:31.551
and he made journalism a weapon.

1415
01:30:31.634 --> 01:30:33.886
I think he was the first journalist that.

1416
01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:36.889
if I remember correctly.
was killed this way.

1417
01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:38.641
On the street.

1418
01:30:38.724 --> 01:30:42.311
That's where it happened.
leaving his office.

1419
01:30:42.395 --> 01:30:46.399
A crime against all of Mexico.
It wasn't just against one man.

1420
01:30:47.233 --> 01:30:50.987
But the ideas. freedom.
and truth will always live on.

1421
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:55.908
regardless of whether they murder
brave men like Manuel Buendía.

1422
01:30:55.992 --> 01:30:59.203
He continued to report.

1423
01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:03.958
but the people with power
remained in the limelight.

1424
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:10.465
And to take such enormous risks
for zero results

1425
01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:14.427
is disappointing and unfair.

1426
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:17.972
And it makes you ask yourself. "What for?"

1427
01:31:18.055 --> 01:31:20.725
WHAT FOR?

1428
01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:23.936
"God's Truce."

1429
01:31:25.563 --> 01:31:26.981
When the meadow catches fire.

1430
01:31:28.232 --> 01:31:30.693
when there's a threat of flood.

1431
01:31:30.776 --> 01:31:33.654
or something frightens the animals.

1432
01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:37.492
the beasts and vermin share refuge

1433
01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:39.160
without fighting.

1434
01:31:39.785 --> 01:31:42.205
Without tearing each other to pieces.

1435
01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:46.959
The farmers call this "God's truce."

1436
01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:50.004
Let's call a truce.

1437
01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:54.634
If we are not capable
of acting rationally.

1438
01:31:55.301 --> 01:31:58.846
let us be guided by our animal instincts.

1439
01:32:01.015 --> 01:32:02.266
What does this mean?

1440
01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:06.103
How meaningful
are the other things that are happening?

1441
01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:10.316
I repeat. we have the need
and the subject matter

1442
01:32:10.399 --> 01:32:13.361
to examine a political event

1443
01:32:13.444 --> 01:32:17.240
that is multilayered.
that has different shades and textures.

1444
01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:21.285
and that probably has deceptive lighting.

1445
01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:25.498
Well. there will hopefully still be time

1446
01:32:25.581 --> 01:32:29.335
to keep speaking with you.
in front of you.

1447
01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:33.923
For now.
thank you for listening to me today.

1448
