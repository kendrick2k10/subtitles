00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's rolling round the bend

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Since I don't know when

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Keeps a rollin'

5
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
My mama told me. "Son"

6
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Don't ever play with guns"

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Just to watch him die

8
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That whistle blowin'

9
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I got another 15.

10
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Not today. you don't.
You're up.

11
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You know the deal.

12
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Successfully complete
the mission.

13
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you get ten years
off your sentence.

14
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
You fail to follow my orders
in any way

15
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and I detonate
the explosive device

16
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Good dog.

17
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We are
a black ops unit.

18
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Meaning. nothing you see here
ever happened.

19
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Savant.

20
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Your commanding officer

21
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Or would you
rather be called Durlin?

22
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'd rather not
be called at all.

23
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But I'll do anything
to get out of this hellhole.

24
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Well.
welcome to "anything."

25
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So this is
the famous Suicide Squad.

26
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Well. we consider
that term degrading.

27
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The official term
is "Task Force X."

28
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And love 'em or hate 'em.

29
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
these are your brothers and
sisters for the next few days.

30
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Oh!

31
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Whoa.

32
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Captain Boomerang.

33
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Blackguard.

34
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Mongal.

35
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Javelin.

36
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
T.D.K.

37
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Weasel.

38
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And. of course...

39
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Hey. guys. sorry I'm late.
Had to go number two.

40
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Hmm. good to know.

41
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Flag.

42
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Oh. sorry. Comin' through.

43
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Hey. Boomer.

44
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
What are you doing back
in prison. Harls?

45
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I got road rage. In a bank.

46
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
-Oh. So sorry. Comin' through.

47
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
-Turn it around. There. No.
-There? Here?

48
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Put it in there.
Now you're safe.

49
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
All right.

50
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Thanks. man.

51
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Prepare for liftoff.
And away we go.

52
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Harley and T.D.K...
- Digger.

53
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
...have they worked
together before?

54
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Not yet. I'm excited.

55
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
What does
Savant do again?

56
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It's Brian Durlin.

57
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
He's an expert in weapons
and hand-to-hand combat.

58
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Yeah. well. I'm putting 20
on him that he's gonna bite it.

59
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Me too. And Weasel.

60
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
-Boomer and Mongal.
- Yeah. I think...

61
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Is Mongal an alien
or some type of god?

62
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
-What are you doing?
-Oh. Hey.

63
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Just making sure
everything was ready to go.

64
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Good meeting. everybody.

65
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Just our normal.
casual morning meeting.

66
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Yeah. I just gotta. uh.
do this thing.

67
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Nothing weird about it.

68
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Okay.
- Oh. yeah.

69
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Flag.

70
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Yeah. we're T-minus five
from the drop.

71
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Get the whole team safely

72
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
to that beach. Colonel.

73
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
You will receive
further orders once there.

74
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
-

75
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We're in
a butcher's freezer. Harls.

76
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
surrounded by dead hogs
hangin' on hooks.

77
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Only they don't know it yet.

78
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Leave him alone. Boomer.

79
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What does T.D.K. stand for?

80
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
What?

81
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Your name is T.D.K.. correct?

82
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Yeah.

83
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And it stands for what?

84
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It stands for me.

85
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It's what a name is.

86
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Your name is letters?

87
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
All names are letters.
dickhead.

88
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I love your accent.

89
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
American women
all love accents.

90
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
We do.
'Cause we don't got none.

91
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
-Yo. is this a dog?
-What?

92
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Is this thing a dog?

93
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
-A... A dog?
-Yes.

94
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
What kind of dog
do you think it is. mate?

95
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I don't know. I'm not familiar
with all the breeds.

96
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I'm gonna go with Afghan Hound.

97
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Since when does an Afghan
Hound have bloody thumbs?

98
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Oh. my God. is it a werewolf?

99
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I've wanted to meet
a werewolf forever.

100
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Yo. they sat me
next to a werewolf?

101
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
That's not right.

102
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Yo. let me out.
I do not fuck with werewolves.

103
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Hey. hey.
he's not a werewolf. okay!

104
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
He's a weasel. He's harmless.

105
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I mean. he's not harmless.
he's killed 27 children.

106
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
but. you know. we got him to...

107
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I think he's agreed to do this.

108
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Whatever the case.

109
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
just everyone
get into position to drop.

110
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Did anyone check
on whether Weasel could swim?

111
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The Weasel is dead! I repeat.

112
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
-the Weasel is dead.
-

113
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Northeast. all clear.
Approach the shore.

114
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Over.

115
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Savant. hold your position.

116
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Roger that.

117
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Amateurs.

118
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Waller. we're
on the beach and dry.

119
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
-Blackguard. Get down. you...
-Hey. guys! Hey.

120
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
...there's fucking soldiers
everywhere!

121
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
You can come out now.
it's just me.

122
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
What the fuck
is Blackguard doin'?

123
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I'm the one who contacted you.

124
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Is this what's supposed
to happen? What the fuck?

125
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Blackguard. get back
into your position.

126
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Look. look.
I brought everybody. look.

127
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
They're right behind me.

128
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Whoa. Hey.

129
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Hey. guys. Whoa.

130
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We got a deal. right?
Uh... Uh...

131
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Waller. we're made.

132
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I'm the one who called you.

133
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Blackguard sold us out.

134
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
He contacted the fucking
Corto Maltese Army!

135
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Waller. we need to retreat.

136
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Negative. Flag.

137
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
The mission is too important.

138
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
This is a tough group.

139
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
-You can make it.
-Okey-doke.

140
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Waller. with all due respect.
we're in the middle

141
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
of a goddamn... Harley. wait!

142
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Whoo-hoo!

143
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Zero-two-two-seven
is wide open.

144
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Colonel. dispatch

145
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
-The Detachable Kid.
-T.D.K.. two o'clock!

146
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
T.D.K. is "The Detachable Kid"?

147
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
-

148
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
What the fuck?

149
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I didn't pick the damn team!

150
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Don't worry. Flag.
I got the bird.

151
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
-Mongal! Don't.
-

152
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
-Huh?
-

153
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Strewth!

154
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Boomer!

155
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Savant is off the rails.

156
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Savant. turn back.

157
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
-Savant.
-

158
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Savant. I'm warning you.
this is desertion.

159
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Savant!

160
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
This is your last chance.
Turn back around.

161
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
You are in violation
of your agreement!

162
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Oh. please! No.

163
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
-

164
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Damn it.

165
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
How's Team Two holding up?

166
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Team Two. check.
Set point bravo.

167
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
All troops on the south beach
are engaged.

168
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Team Two is clear to go
on the north beach.

169
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Congratulations. Bloodsport.

170
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
How'd you do it. Waller?

171
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
There's no soldiers out here
on patrol at all.

172
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Let's
just say they were distracted.

173
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
He was twelve years old

174
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
On East Two-nine

175
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
When she pulled the plug

176
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Fourteen years old

177
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
When he died

178
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Who died. died

179
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Who died. died

180
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Who died. died

181
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Who died. died

182
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And just died

183
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Let their gimmicks go rotten

184
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
In upper Manhattan

185
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Bullet in the head

186
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
On the night that he was wed

187
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Two more friends of mine

188
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Who died. died

189
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Who died. died

190
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Who died. died

191
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Who died. died

192
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And they died

193
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
From a hotel room

194
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
From a cell in The Tombs

195
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
In the jugular vein

196
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
More than all the others

197
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Who died. died

198
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
For the road

199
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
To wear that heavy load

200
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Of Baudelaire before

201
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Oh. jeez.

202
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Oh.

203
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Here you go. champ.

204
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Excuse me.

205
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Who the fuck is Bloodsport?

206
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Robert DuBois.

207
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
A world-class marksman.

208
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
In his hands.
anything is a deadly weapon.

209
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
His father was a mercenary

210
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
who trained his son to kill
from the moment he was born.

211
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
He's in prison for putting
Superman in the ICU

212
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
with a kryptonite bullet.

213
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
-DuBois?
-Same answer as the last time.

214
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Piss off.

215
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I'm not joining your goddamn
Suicide Squad.

216
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
We'll see.

217
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
You have a visitor.

218
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
They said you got in trouble.

219
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I stole.

220
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
You stole what?

221
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
-A style watch.
-A star latch?

222
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
A style watch.
You can watch TV on it.

223
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Why would you want to
watch TV on your watch?

224
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
I don't know.

225
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Next time you want
to nick something.

226
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
you take a partner.

227
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and they can be your lookout.

228
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
That's your advice?

229
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Yeah.

230
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
You're a terrible father.

231
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Hey. I didn't ask
to be a father

232
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
You make that perfectly clear.

233
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Your mother sprung
that one on me.

234
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Well. she's not around anymore.

235
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
so you can lay off
of her. okay?

236
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Oh. I tried to lay off her.

237
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
but then she dragged out
the paternity test.

238
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
-Fuck you!
-No. fuck you!

239
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

240
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

241
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

242
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Fuck you!

243
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I can't believe
you don't care that I stole.

244
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
only that I got caught!

245
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I don't only care
that you got caught.

246
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I care that you got caught
for stealing

247
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
something as stupid
as a fucking TV watch!

248
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
It does other things too!

249
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
But nothing that your phone
can't fucking do!

250
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
It's embarrassing!

251
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
No. what's fucking embarrassing

252
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
is having you as my father.

253
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Yeah. well. I told you. Tyla.

254
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
when I came here
that any goodness

255
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I ever had in me had been
wrung out bare by my old man.

256
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And I also told you to go out
there and do your own thing

257
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
and stay far away

258
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
from me or anyone like me.
didn't I?

259
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
So. why are you here
when you and I both know

260
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I have nothing good
to offer you?

261
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Because my court date
is coming up.

262
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
and Miss Waller said
maybe you could help me out.

263
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
To get me to lead
your shite fucking mission.

264
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
you're gonna send
my 14-year-old daughter

265
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
No.

266
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Your daughter is 16. DuBois.

267
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
You're a real
father of the year.

268
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Fine. You know what.
Tyla needs to grow up anyway

269
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
'cause she's a little ditzy
like her fucking mother.

270
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So. a year in juvie.
no fucking problem.

271
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Not juvie. Being 16
in the state of Louisiana

272
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
means that
under the right circumstances.

273
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
she could be tried as an adult.

274
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And. if convicted.

275
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
could be sent right here
to old Belle Reve.

276
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
And in here. well. you never
know what might happen

277
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
to a frail young thing
like that.

278
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Shames me to say

279
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
that we have
the highest mortality rate

280
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
in the entire
U.S. prison system.

281
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Whoa. hey. hey. hey!

282
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
You're threatening
my fucking daughter!

283
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I'm protecting this country.

284
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
-Everyone stand down.
-Miss Waller. I...

285
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Stand down!

286
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
I wouldn't take
such extreme measures...

287
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Oh. extreme?
Oh. yeah. a little extreme.

288
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
...if this mission
weren't more important

289
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
than you could
possibly imagine.

290
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Fuck your mission.

291
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
You have the military
experience necessary.

292
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

293
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
you have what it takes
to be a leader.

294
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
No. I'm no fucking leader!

295
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Then I'll make you one.

296
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Are you in or out?

297
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Good. Let's meet your team.

298
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
-Come on.
-Fuck me. man.

299
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Let's go.

300
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
She was gonna kill his kid?

301
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Each member
of the team is chosen

302
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

303
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
This is Christopher Smith.
known as Peacemaker.

304
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
In his hands.
anything is a deadly weapon.

305
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

306
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

307
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
-Are you having a laugh?
-What?

308
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
You just said each member
of the team is chosen

309
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

310
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
But better.

311
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
I always hit
my targets dead center.

312
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I hit them more in the center.

313
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Well. you can't hit something
more in a center.

314
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
-I use smaller bullets.
-What?

315
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
They go inside
your bullet holes

316
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
without even touching the side.

317
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Next up is King Shark.

318
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Holy shit.

319
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
What the fuck?

320
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Some people claim

321
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

322
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Whatever the case.
he's strong and deadly.

323
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Does it talk?

324
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Book read.
-

325
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Book's upside-down.

326
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

327
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
So smart. me.
Enjoy book so much.

328
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Be a mite careful.

329
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
as he's developed a taste
for human meat.

330
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Huh?

331
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Next. we have Cleo Cazo.

332
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
-Ratcatcher 2.
-

333
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
-Settle down!

334
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Ooh.

335
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
What. we couldn't
afford Ratcatcher 1?

336
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
He's dead.
This is his daughter.

337
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Cazo. will you be joining us?

338
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
I just woke up.

339
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I don't function well
early in the morning.

340
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
My deepest apologies
for disturbing you.

341
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Hmm. it's all right.

342
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
-Get your ass out here!
-

343
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Millennials.

344
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Oh. no way.

345
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
-That's not coming with us.
-She controls rats.

346
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
I know. I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

347
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
This is Sebastian.
Say hello. Sebastian.

348
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I'm not shakin' the rat's hand.

349
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And finally.
we have Abner Krill.

350
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
What's that 'round his neck?

351
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
A power dampener.

352
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
They call him
the Polka Dot Man.

353
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Polka Dot Man.

354
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
What's he do.
throw polka dots at people?

355
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
He does.

356
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
He throws polka dots at people.

357
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Hey. Polka Dot Man.

358
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

359
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
You fucking pussy!

360
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
-These are soldiers?

361
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
We need to debrief.

362
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Fuck.

363
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Corto Maltese

364
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
is a small island nation off
the coast of South America.

365
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Over the past 100 years.

366
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
the country has been ruled
with an iron fist

367
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
by the Herrera family.

368
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
But. a week ago. this guy.

369
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
General Silvio Luna.
along with his right-hand man.

370
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Mayor General Mateo Suarez.

371
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
took control of
the Corto Maltese government

372
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
in a violent military coup.

373
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

374
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Although the United States
did not condone

375
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
the excesses
of the Herrera regime.

376
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

377
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Luna. however.
is virulently anti-American.

378
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
So. you want us to kill Luna?

379
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
No.

380
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
This is Jotunheim.

381
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
A scientific
experimentation facility

382
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
containing something known only
as Project Starfish.

383
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Our intelligence sources
tell us

384
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
that Starfish
is extraterrestrial in origin.

385
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
In the hands
of the Luna regime.

386
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

387
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Your mission
is to infiltrate Jotunheim

388
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

389
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000
How are we supposed to get in?

390
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Gaius Grieves. the Thinker.

391
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

392
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
After hours. he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

393
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
known as La Gatita Amable.

394
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

395
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
and he can get you
into Jotunheim.

396
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Any questions?

397
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
What is that?

398
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
That is
an overhead projector.

399
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Do you ever use it anymore?

400
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
No. not really.

401
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
So. why don't you
just throw it away?

402
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Peacemaker?

403
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

404
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Think there's any connection?

405
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
No.

406
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
No...

407
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Nanaue.

408
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
...connection.

409
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Hand.

410
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Yes. that is your hand.
Nanaue. very good.

411
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
We're all gonna die.

412
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
I hope so.

413
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Oh. for fuck's sake.

414
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Control. we have a disturbance
south of here.

415
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
It's just
a diversion. Bloodsport.

416
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
All right.
we cut through the jungle

417
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

418
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
That's the word.

419
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
How we getting in? Especially
with Charlie the Tuna here.

420
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

421
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:05.000
You're the leader.

422
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
You're supposed to be decisive.

423
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
And I've decided
that you should eat

424
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
a big bag of dicks. how's that?

425
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
You're being facetious.
but if this whole beach

426
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
was completely covered in dicks

427
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
and somebody said I had to eat

428
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
every dick until the beach
was clean for liberty.

429
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
I would say no problemo.

430
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

431
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Who knows why madmen
do what they do?

432
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Well. you know what I think?

433
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
I think liberty
is just your excuse

434
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
to do whatever you want.

435
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Whether that's to eat a beach
full of dicks or killin' folk.

436
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Oh. yeah?

437
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
At least I don't kill men
for money like you.

438
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Oh. here we go.

439
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
There's something wrong
with your skin.

440
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
It's just a rash.

441
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
That's a rash?

442
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
-

443
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Oh. no.

444
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
You...

445
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
are the only one...

446
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
fit to carry my javelin.

447
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Carry it for...

448
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Carry it for who?

449
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
For what? What the heck?

450
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Who am I supposed
to carry it for?

451
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
This is so frustratin'.

452
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
He just told me I have
to carry this javelin

453
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
for a reason.
but he didn't say why!

454
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Waller? Waller. Waller!

455
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
All right. we'll camp here.

456
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
and tomorrow we'll go
straight through to the city

457
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
to get to La Gatita Amable
by nightfall.

458
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
-

459
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
What?

460
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
How deep of a sleeper are you?

461
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
I was having
the most wonderful dream.

462
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
If it was you about to be
eaten by King Shark.

463
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
then you're psychic.

464
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
I don't believe
he would do that.

465
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
He has very kind eyes.

466
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Hungry.

467
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
You bastard!

468
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
- Uh...

469
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
All right.
calm down with the rats!

470
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
-What?
-I have a thing with rats.

471
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
-You have a thing with rats?
-Yes.

472
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
-And you're on a team with me?
-Not something I asked for!

473
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
What are you
laughing at me for. man?

474
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Why the fuck are you
in your underwear?

475
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Tighty-whities? Really?

476
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
-Now. that's just racist.
- No.

477
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
It's not racist.

478
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
-They're tighty-whities.
- Oh. come the fuck on.

479
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Bloodsport's got a rat phobia.

480
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
-What?
-

481
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
You didn't tell me

482
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
you had a fear of rats. DuBois?

483
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
I'm an assassin! Why would I
share my liabilities?

484
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
For fuck's sake.

485
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Aw. He's offering you
a pretty leaf

486
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
to show you he means no harm.

487
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Why the fuck
would I want a leaf?

488
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Just get the rats out of here!

489
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
-Oh. fuck's sake.
-Huh. Cool.

490
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Hey. we gonna kill
Megalodouche now. or what?

491
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Nanaue's the strongest
member of your team.

492
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
You need him
to get into Jotunheim.

493
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Yeah. well.
we can't function as a team

494
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
if we gotta watch our back

495
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
from one of our own
eatin' our bollocks.

496
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Nanaue.
would you eat your friends?

497
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
I no friends.

498
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
You have no friends?

499
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
If you did. would you eat them?

500
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Yes.

501
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
No?

502
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Then. can we be your friends?

503
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Come on.

504
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
He's obviously lying.

505
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
If I die
'cause I gambled on love.

506
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
it will be a worthy death.

507
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Friends.

508
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
You are a little idiot.

509
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
-

510
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Oh. my God! Oh. my God.
I'm good at my job.

511
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I found him.

512
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Check it out.

513
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Look. right here. a mile north.

514
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Task Force X.

515
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
you have an additional
mission directive.

516
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
We've located
Colonel Rick Flag.

517
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
He's been taken by the enemy.

518
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Rick Flag?

519
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
I know. you both served

520
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
on special forces in Qurac
that took down Avral Kaddam.

521
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Flag was the one
who initially recommended you.

522
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
You had
other operatives

523
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
and didn't tell us?

524
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
There was no tactical
advantage. now there is.

525
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
I've uploaded the location
on your MTS.

526
00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Terminate his captors
with extreme prejudice.

527
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Kill anyone you see.
These are dangerous people.

528
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Recover Flag before moving on
to the city.

529
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
-

530
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
That's where
they're holding Flag.

531
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Nothing like a bloodbath
to start the day.

532
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
They call you Peacemaker?

533
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
I cherish peace
with all my heart.

534
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
I don't care
how many men. women.

535
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
and children
I need to kill to get it.

536
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
I thought
you were the crazy one.

537
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
I am.

538
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
All right.

539
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Let's get it.

540
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Boss.

541
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Gracias.

542
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
-

543
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
-

544
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
-

545
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
No. no. no!

546
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
-

547
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Hmm?

548
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Non-lethal.

549
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
You lose.

550
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Exploding compression bullets.

551
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
-

552
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
No one likes a show-off.

553
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Unless what they're
showing off is dope as fuck.

554
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Fuck. That's true.

555
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
He does throw
polka dots at people.

556
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
I'm sorry it's so...
flamboyant.

557
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
It looks cool. I think.

558
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
I don't like to kill people.

559
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
but if I pretend
they're my mom. it's easy.

560
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
T.M.I.. mate.

561
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
DuBois?

562
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Hey. Flag.

563
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
What the hell
are you doing here?

564
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Waller told us that you were...

565
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Uh...

566
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Are you drinkin' tea?

567
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
This is Sol Soria.

568
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
she's the leader
of the freedom fighters.

569
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
the resistance trying to take
down the current government.

570
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
They saved my life.

571
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Oh. wow.

572
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Why did my people not alert me
of your arrival?

573
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
We didn't see any people.

574
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Yeah. I didn't see
anybody on the way...

575
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
There's no one out there.

576
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
They were gone
when we got here.

577
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
I turned them into my mother
in my head and killed them.

578
00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Typical Americans.
Just run in. guns blazing.

579
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I know. this is messed up.

580
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
-These guys. they're...
-What's this one do?

581
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
They're fucking idiots.

582
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
but right now our objectives
align with yours.

583
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
If Jotunheim
contains the technology

584
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
our intelligence says it does.

585
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
then it could be used
on the people of Corto Maltese

586
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
as well as Americans.

587
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
That's why we need your help

588
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
to get into the city
so we can stop 'em.

589
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Is that rat waving at me?

590
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
It appears it is.

591
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Why?

592
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I'm gonna guess
because it's friendly.

593
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Luna and Suarez
murdered my entire family.

594
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
I'd make a deal
with the Devil to stop them.

595
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Your people will have our help
getting to Valle Del Mar

596
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
to apprehend
this Gaius Grieves.

597
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Hey.

598
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
-What is this?
-You slaughtered my staff!

599
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
They were loyal
to the Herreras.

600
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Who are you loyal to. Thinker?

601
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000
They call you "Thinker." yes?

602
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
All that shit in your face
is to make your brain good?

603
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Yes. makes my brain good.

604
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Are you being sarcastic
with me?

605
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Hey! Hey.

606
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
I shall do to you
as we did to your employees.

607
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Hey. Mateo!

608
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
What is this?

609
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Project Starfish.

610
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
It's been the primary focus
of my experiments here

611
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
for the past 30 years.

612
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Here.
What... What is it doing here?

613
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Oh!

614
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
It is having little babies.

615
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Not progeny.

616
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
extensions of itself.

617
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
They take hosts.

618
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
and those hosts in turn become
part of the central being.

619
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
It feeds
on their consciousnesses.

620
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Grows larger. more powerful.

621
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
So...

622
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
where is
this Project Starfish now?

623
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Marvelous idea. Presidente.

624
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
But as I've noted.

625
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
I've been working
with the beast for 30 years.

626
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
And there's no one but me
capable of controlling it.

627
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Well. then...

628
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
welcome to the team.

629
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Si.  Camila.

630
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Presidente.

631
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
You are making
a big mistake

632
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
throwing me down here!

633
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
I will be outta here
soon enough

634
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
and I will kill
every last one of you.

635
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Colto Maltese-tezios.
Maltese-els.

636
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Malte-multoids. Colt-a-mults?

637
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Whatever you  Mario Kart-racing
d-bags are called!

638
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Please.

639
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Put this on.

640
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Oh. wow.

641
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I'm a princess.

642
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Senorita  Quinn.

643
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
on behalf of the entire staff
of Our Honorable General

644
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Presidente Silvio
Eleuterio Luna.

645
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
it's a pleasure to serve you.

646
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Gracias.

647
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
My mother said
to count back again.

648
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Ten. nine.

649
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
eight. seven. six.

650
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
five. four. three.

651
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000
two. one. Ha!
Coronel. beat that...

652
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Oh.

653
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Forgive my appearance.
Senorita  Quinn.

654
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
I have admired you from afar

655
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
for many years now.

656
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Senorita.

657
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Me?

658
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
You're a hero to me.
as well as to my people.

659
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
I think you might
got me confused.

660
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Harley Quinn's fire
and rebellion

661
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
in the face
of American oppression

662
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
is something to which
my entire country aspires.

663
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Oh.

664
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
I have prepared lunch.

665
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Would you be so kind
as to join me?

666
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
I'm so kind. sure.

667
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
You're not lonely?

668
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
To come and go

669
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Oh. my. you caught my eye

670
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Just irresistible

671
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
You're not lonely?

672
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
You want me to what?

673
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
To marry me.

674
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
You're joshing.

675
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Might I be frank. Harley?

676
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
You might be.

677
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Good. listen.

678
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Since I took control.
the majority love me.

679
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
But some find me to be

680
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
an unacceptable leader.

681
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
What kinds of dicks
would find that?

682
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Don't they know
how awesome you are?

683
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Have you shown them
the birdies?

684
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
It may sound archaic

685
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
to someone
from your part of the world.

686
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
but my people.
the Corto Malteseans.

687
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
they're very old-fashioned.

688
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Corto Malteseans. of course.

689
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
And I am a bachelor.

690
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
So they want
you to get hitched?

691
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
My people say you would
make the perfect wife.

692
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Because. you know.

693
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
you symbolize
anti-American fervor.

694
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Oh.

695
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
But I am a romantic. Harley.

696
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
I agreed to meet with you
just to appease them.

697
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
However. upon spending
the day with you.

698
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
I find myself hardly able
to think straight.

699
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
-You are perfect in every...
-You are so freaking hot.

700
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Just irresistible

701
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Harley Luna.

702
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
I like the ring of that.

703
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
That's Jotunheim?

704
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Nazis came here seeking asylum
after World War II.

705
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
They built Jotunheim
to continue

706
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
their unorthodox experiments.

707
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Until the Herrera family
accepted the bounty

708
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
and killed them all.

709
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Wowza.

710
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Many years ago.
the rumors began of a beast.

711
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
These dark rumors helped
the Herrera family

712
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
They would send
their political enemies

713
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
and their families
to the fortress.

714
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
never to return.

715
00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
I have recently learned

716
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
these were not rumors.

717
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
They were murdering thousands

718
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
in bizarre experiments
with this creature.

719
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Well. it must be a big relief

720
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
to got it
in your hands now. huh?

721
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Absolutely.

722
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Now. it is our enemies
who shall be fearful.

723
00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
If anyone dares
to say a negative word

724
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
about their
new president today.

725
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000
their parents. their children.
and anyone they ever loved

726
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
will be sent to Jotunheim
to feed the beast.

727
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
I'm sorry.

728
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Recently. I made
a promise to myself

729
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
that the next time
I got a boyfriend.

730
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
I'd be on the lookout
for red flags.

731
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
And if I saw any.

732
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
I would do the healthy thing

733
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
and I would murder him.

734
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
And killing kids?

735
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Kind of a red flag.

736
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
I know. I know.

737
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
I know what
you're tryin' to say.

738
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
"Harley. why not just leave?"

739
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
And I'd say.
"Why are you screaming at me?

740
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
"I'm not deaf.
I'm standing right here."

741
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
And then I'd say.

742
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
"When your taste in men
is as bad as mine.

743
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
they don't just
go away quietly.

744
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
"They slash your tires
and they kill your dogs and

745
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
tell you
that the music you like

746
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
ain't real music at all."

747
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
And all the cruelty...

748
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
...tears you apart
after a while.

749
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
You were real pretty and all.

750
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
and R.I.P. to that absolutely
beautiful monster

751
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
between your legs. but...

752
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
all in all...

753
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
I think you're
more pretty like this.

754
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
with all those rotten thoughts
emptied from your head.

755
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
I can't believe
this thing had a bullet.

756
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Yeah. yeah. yeah. I got it.

757
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
-

758
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
What the hell
are you doin'?

759
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000
We're tired.
Colonel. We need a rest.

760
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Goddamn hobbyists.

761
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
We cannot stop.

762
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
We need to hurry if you're
going to help my people.

763
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Hey. We're not here
to help your people.

764
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
But she's right.
we gotta keep moving.

765
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
I carry friend?

766
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
It's okay. Nanaue.

767
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
It's happening
to his face again.

768
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
-It's nothing. I slipped.
-Hey...

769
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Norman Bates. if that shit's
contagious. we need to know.

770
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
What is it?
-It's a...

771
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
It's an interdimensional virus.

772
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Fuck is that?

773
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000
My mother was a scientist
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

774
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
and she was obsessed
with turning me

775
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
and my brothers and sisters
into superheroes.

776
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
She infected me.

777
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Now. if I don't. you know.
expel the dots twice a day...

778
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Then what?

779
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
They'll eat me alive.

780
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
What happened
to your brothers and sisters?

781
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Some lived.

782
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Some...

783
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000
died.

784
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
And your mom. where is she now?

785
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Everywhere.

786
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Okay. Let's move out.

787
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Come on.
we must hurry.

788
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
or we'll be late
to meet my contact.

789
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Saying something

790
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
They pay you well

791
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Sailing men to...

792
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
-

793
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
-Nom. nom!
-

794
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
-

795
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Are you Milton?

796
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Si.

797
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Milton will drive you
through town

798
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
and to La Gatita Amable.

799
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
There are clothes in the boxes
for all of you

800
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
so you can blend in.

801
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
That said. the walking  tiburon

802
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
is gonna have
to stay out of sight.

803
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000
I wear disguise.

804
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Oh. you're going
to wear a disguise.

805
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Si.

806
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Hey. he's learnin' Spanish.

807
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
And what kind of disguise?

808
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
-Fake mustache.
-Oh.

809
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Yeah. fake mustache
isn't gonna cut it. mate.

810
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
There's gonna be a lot of
soldiers watching Jotunheim.

811
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
If they discover us there...

812
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Let's pray they do not.
or you will all be dead.

813
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
If they do.

814
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
that'll leave
the palace vulnerable.

815
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Luna and the other generals

816
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
will be left
without protection.

817
00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000
You're a good man.
Colonel Flag.

818
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
You still look
exactly like yourself.

819
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
That's the worst fake
mustache I've ever seen.

820
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
And if you had fooled us.
we'd have to kill you.

821
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
shark-shaped bloke
with a moustache

822
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
creeping up on us like that.

823
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
-You. you.
-

824
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Aw.

825
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000
He always wants to be near you.

826
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
I think he senses good in you.

827
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Yeah. there's no good in me.

828
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Damn.

829
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Supposed to play golf with
Senator Cray this weekend.

830
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
-I'm gonna look a fool.
-

831
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Waller. come in.

832
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Ugh.

833
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000
You missed.

834
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Waller. do you copy?

835
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000
We're losing connection.

836
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Waller.

837
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Fuck's sake.

838
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Task Force X.
-Waller.

839
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
You there?

840
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000
The military must have put

841
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
signal jammers around the city.

842
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Your comms are down.

843
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
but we can still activate
the bombs.

844
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
not to mention what will
happen to your daughter.

845
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
So. no funny business.

846
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Do you copy. DuBois?

847
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Copy.

848
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Fuck you!

849
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Hey. uh. all that stuff
about his daughter.

850
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
you wouldn't
really do that. right?

851
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
You don't know half
of what I would do. John.

852
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
What?

853
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Why are you so afraid of rats?

854
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Why are you so in love
with them. Ratcatcher 2?

855
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
You know what I think?

856
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
I think you have a serious
case of daddy issues.

857
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
I have no issues with
how much I loved my father.

858
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Although he was a genius...

859
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
we lived homeless
in the streets of Portugal

860
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000
burdens.

861
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
He built the machines
I employ today...

862
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
...and taught me the secrets
of calling the rats.

863
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000
They brought us
trinkets to live on.

864
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
And they kept us warm at night.

865
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
when we would have frozen.

866
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
-But eventually...
-  Papa.

867
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Papa. wake up.

868
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000
...my father's burdens

869
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:24.000
became too heavy to carry.

870
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000
No.

871
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000
No. Papa.

872
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
-And he was gone.
-Papa. wake up.

873
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000
I took his machinery
and came to America.

874
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
That is the dream. right?

875
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
But I was arrested

876
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000
for armed bank robbery.
do you believe it?

877
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
The state considered
the rats a weapon.

878
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
What?

879
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
You remind me of my daughter.

880
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000
the reason I'm here.

881
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Why are you so afraid of rats?

882
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
My old man.

883
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000
When I was a lad.

884
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.000
if I didn't finish
a task right.

885
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000
he would dole out
the punishment.

886
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:20.000
And one day. he just locked me
in a crate for 24 hours.

887
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
And it was
full of starvin' rats.

888
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000
As imperfect my father was...

889
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000
he loved me.

890
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
I wish I could
give that to you.

891
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Don't you worry. yeah?

892
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
I'm gonna get you
out of here alive.

893
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000
I'm going to get you
out of here alive.

894

1076
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
All right.

1077
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
here's the deal.
We fail the mission. you die.

1078
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000
We find out any information
you give us is false. you die.

1079
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
If we find out you have
personalized license plates.

1080
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
What? No.

1081
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
If you mismatch blacks.
you die.

1082
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
No.

1083
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
If you cough without
covering your mouth...

1084
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Harley. Those last three
aren't things.

1085
01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Although. probably
don't need to say this.

1086
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
but that isn't
an open invitation

1087
01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
for you to cough
without covering your mouth.

1088
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
All right. we're gonna need
you to drive the minibus.

1089
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
with all of us inside. past
the guards at the front gate.

1090
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Once through the gate.
we'll use you to get through

1091
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
There are security cameras
everywhere.

1092
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
They're being dealt with.

1093
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
We'll neutralize the soldiers
there and enter.

1094
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Once we're inside.
we separate into teams.

1095
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I am walking back and forth.

1096
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Okay. You're gonna lead me
and Ratcatcher 2

1097
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I'm going with you
'cause I don't trust this guy.

1098
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
No. no. no.
you're coming with me.

1099
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Our munitions expertise
are needed

1100
01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
starting at the first floor.
going all the way to the top.

1101
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Once we're clear. we blow
the tits off that thing.

1102
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
and go home.

1103
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
This is suicide.

1104
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Well. that's kind of our thing.

1105
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Yeah.

1106
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
This is insane.

1107
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
-

1108
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Must be a devil between us...

1109
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Yeah. no.

1110
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I love the rain.

1111
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
It's like angels
are splooging all over us.

1112
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
It's good for cover.

1113
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Yep. that too.

1114
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
-

1115
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
-You son of a bit...
-

1116
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Input
the emergency code. Now!

1117
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Well. go on then!

1118
01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Yo!

1119
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Okay. Pokey.

1120
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
You get a bomb. you get a bomb.

1121
01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Harley and I
will meet you up

1122
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Yeah? All right.

1123
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
God damn it.
Nanaue.

1124
01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
No!

1125
01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Quit bein' a play baby.

1126
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Peacemaker.

1127
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
-It's actually very nice.
-

1128
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Just put it against the wall.

1129
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
It looks nothin' like me.

1130
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Move. Move it.

1131
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
This way.

1132
01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
-

1133
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Si.

1134
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Vamonos. Vamonos!

1135
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Good God.

1136
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
If God existed.

1137
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
wouldn't this be proof
that he wasn't good at all?

1138
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
What the hell is this?

1139
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I thought you were looking
for Project Starfish.

1140
01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
You've brought us visitors.
have you. Grieves?

1141
01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Have you come to save me
from that madman?

1142
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Thirty years he's kept me here.

1143
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Tortured me.

1144
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Had his way with me.

1145
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
I call it Starro the Conqueror.

1146
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
That's meant to be derisive.

1147
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Sorry. old chum.

1148
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
These two are here to kill you.

1149
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
It's out of my hands.

1150
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
We need to help these people.

1151
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Impossible. dear. They're
corpses below those stars.

1152
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Who are they?

1153
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
The fodder of powerful men
through every age.

1154
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Dissidents.

1155
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
journalists.

1156
01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
political rivals.

1157
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
and their loved ones.

1158
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Oh. please.

1159
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.000
unclutch your fucking pearls.
Flag.

1160
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
We serve the same master.

1161
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
We were sent here to stop you.

1162
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Child.

1163
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
your government
didn't send you here

1164
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000
to protect the world
from alien technology.

1165
01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Your government sent you here
to cover up their part in it.

1166
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
You're a goddamn liar.

1167
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000
American goddamn astronauts
found Starro.

1168
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.

1169
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Although the Cold War
was ended.

1170
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
your government
saw the potential

1171
01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
in weaponizing
such a powerful beast.

1172
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
but banish the thought

1173
01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
of any such experiments
being held on American soil.

1174
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Your people
have always been squeamish

1175
01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
about the sacrifices necessary

1176
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
for scientific advancement.

1177
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000
So.

1178
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
the United States
made a secret deal

1179
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000
with the Corto Maltese
government

1180
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
to conduct
their illegal experiments here

1181
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
in Jotunheim.

1182
01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
And they hired me
to oversee them.

1183
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000
And now. because of

1184
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
a run-of-the-mill
fucking military coup.

1185
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
they're gonna destroy
30 years' worth of efforts.

1186
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Yeah!

1187
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
You're the real victim here.

1188
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
The hell you doing here?
You're supposed to be upstairs

1189
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
I told you I didn't trust him.

1190
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Your records are located
in those computers?

1191
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Colonel. what are you doing?

1192
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
I joined the military
to serve my country.

1193
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
not to be its puppet.

1194
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
What are you doing?

1195
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Who are you going
to show that to?

1196
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
The press. Goddamn people
deserve to know.

1197
01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
I'm tired of coverin' up
their dirty little secrets.

1198
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
This time
these sons of bitches

1199
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I can't let you do that.
Colonel.

1200
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
-Excuse me?
-I'm truly sorry.

1201
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Miss Waller charged me
with makin' sure

1202
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
those records
don't leave this building.

1203
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Of course. I shoulda known.

1204
01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Waller's always got a backup.

1205
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Come on. man.
this isn't personal.

1206
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Holdin' a gun on me
is pretty fucking personal.

1207
01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
What is that?

1208
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I'm gonna need that drive.
Colonel.

1209
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
-

1210
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Those morons set off
the explosives too early.

1211
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Hand over the drive!

1212
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
-Let's go. come on!
-

1213
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000
They experimented on children.

1214
01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
No one is sayin'
what they did was right.

1215
01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
They experimented on children!

1216
01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000
That information gets out.

1217
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
it causes
an international incident!

1218
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Keepin' the peace
is worth any price.

1219
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
including the life
of a hero like yours. sir.

1220
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
so please...

1221
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
don't make me do this.

1222
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.000
What have you people done?

1223
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Sebastian. come!

1224
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
-

1225
01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Okay. we gotta calm down.

1226
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Let's all just...
Let's talk about this.

1227
01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I understand
where you're coming from.

1228
01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
I crossed a line.

1229
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Okay. I crossed a line!

1230
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I realize that.
but I'm ready to change.

1231
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I am ready to change.

1232
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And I didn't
mean to hurt you...

1233
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
You motherfucker.

1234
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
-

1235
01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Peacemaker.

1236
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
What a joke.

1237
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Cleo.

1238
01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Give me back the drive.

1239
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
I told you that information
can't get out. Fuck!

1240
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
So. okay. okay.
destroy the hard drive.

1241
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
-Why kill me?
-

1242
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Because I'm thorough.

1243
01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
-Oh. my...

1244
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Sorry. kid.

1245
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
No. no...

1246
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
All right. troops are coming.

1247
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
This floor. and then
nine floors left. Let's go!

1248
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
-Come on!
-

1249
01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
New dumb friends.

1250
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Aw. fizzle sticks. Hold on.

1251
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Has anyone got eyes
or ears on any more?

1252
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:18.000
They killed Milton!

1253
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Milton was still with us?

1254
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
-Where'd you think he was?
- I don't know.

1255
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I thought he stayed back
with the bus.

1256
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000
What was Milton gonna do?

1257
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.000
He was helping us!

1258
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
-Who's Milton?
-What?

1259
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I don't remember any Milton.

1260
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Fuck! He has been with us
the whole time.

1261
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Somebody named Milton
has been with us

1262
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Yes!

1263
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
I don't think so.
I think I would've noticed

1264
01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
if a guy named Milton's
been with us.

1265
01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
It's not a very common name.

1266
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I don't think
I've ever even met Milton.

1267
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Are you messing around
right now?

1268
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.000
He was a really nice guy.

1269
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
and he sacrificed himself
to help us.

1270
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
And now look at him.

1271
01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.000
He's dead.

1272
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Oh. that guy!
Milton. Milton.

1273
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
So. when did this great
love affair with Milton start?

1274
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I liked him
from the beginning. okay?

1275
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I just didn't say
anything until...

1276
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:19.000
No!

1277
01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
-

1278
01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000
-

1279
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
Harley!
Give us a hand!

1280
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Hey!

1281
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Vamos. Vamos.

1282
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
-

1283
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
-

1284
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Oh!

1285
01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
-

1286
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Oh. fuck. fuck.

1287
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Oh. fuck off!

1288
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000
-Oh.
-

1289
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Sorry. kid.

1290
01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:45.000
No. no. no.

1291
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Smaller bullets.

1292
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
He killed Colonel Flag.

1293
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:55.000
He wanted to share this
with the press.

1294
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.000
It's proof
the American government

1295
01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
was behind Project Starfish
the whole time.

1296
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
-

1297
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Whoa. Whoa.

1298
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I think it's trying to get out.

1299
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
-What?
-Starro the...

1300
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Whoa.

1301
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Cover your faces!

1302
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000
-

1303
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Si.

1304
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Si.

1305
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
-

1306
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
-

1307
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
-Whoa.
-What the fuck is that?

1308
01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Uh... Hey. guys?

1309
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Oh. shit. there's...

1310
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
This city is mine.

1311
01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Uh. Miss Waller.
I think the feed is back up.

1312
01:46:58.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Oh. my God. Miss Waller!

1313
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:02.000
We've got a freaking  kaiju
up in this shit!

1314
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:05.000
-

1315
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Task force X. come in.

1316
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Are you there?

1317
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Uh-huh.

1318
01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Whatever signal jammers

1319
01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
were blocking
our communications

1320
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
must have been in the building
you just demolished.

1321
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Yeah. well. we've got a mite
issue over here. Waller.

1322
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
It's Project Starfish.
Miss Waller.

1323
01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
It's headed towards the city.
and I think it wants

1324
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
to feed on as many people
as it can.

1325
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Not our problem.

1326
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
If you've destroyed Jotunheim
and the records within.

1327
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
you've achieved the objective.

1328
01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Corto Maltese
is no longer a U.S. ally.

1329
01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
If anything.
the White House will consider

1330
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
fomenting disruption
in a hostile nation

1331
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.000
a positive development.

1332
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
You heard what she said.

1333
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Fuck.

1334
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Bloodsport is off mission.

1335
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
What the...

1336
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
She'll kill you. you know.

1337
01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
That's her business.

1338
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000
I knew Sebastian sensed good
in you for a reason.

1339
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000
Just keep that fucking rat
away from me.

1340
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Ratcatcher is also off mission.

1341
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Bloodsport. Ratcatcher.

1342
01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:11.000
turn around.

1343
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Nanaue!

1344
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
I know what I'm carrying
the javelin for.

1345
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Krill. turn around now!

1346
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Turn back now. God damn it!

1347
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000
-Open it.
-Miss Waller...

1348
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Open it!

1349
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.000
What are you doing.
Task Force X?

1350
01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000
-Fuck!
-

1351
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Turn around now. God damn it!

1352
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
You dumb pieces of shit!

1353
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Motherfuckers!

1354
01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
God damn it. Task Force X.
this is your last

1355
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
motherfucking warning!

1356
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
-

1357
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Oh. my God!
What the fuck did you do?

1358
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
All those people. John.

1359
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Little kids.

1360
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Task Force X. the creature
is headed to Calle Principal.

1361
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Avoid Avenida Medrano.

1362
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
-There is a swarm of infected.
- Jesus.

1363
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000
So. your clearest path
is Calle Aguero.

1364
01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Get on the satellite. Dale.
you fucking dickhead!

1365
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Yes. ma'am.

1366
01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Huh?

1367
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Harley. take the high ground!

1368
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Nanaue! Monster is nom nom!

1369
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Monster nom nom?

1370
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Yes!

1371
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Abner. do you see who that is?

1372
01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Huh?

1373
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
It's your mom!

1374
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I'm a superhero!

1375
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I'm a motherfucking super...

1376
01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.000
God!

1377
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.000
No! No!

1378
01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Oh. no...

1379
01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
This city

1380
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000
is mine!

1381
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
This city isn't yours.

1382
01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
This city isn't ours.

1383
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
This city is theirs.

1384
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Oh. hell.

1385
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Why rats. Papa?

1386
01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Rats are the lowliest
and most despised

1387
01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
of all creatures. my love.

1388
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
If they have purpose.

1389
01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
so do we all.

1390
01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
I was happy.

1391
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.000
floating. staring at the stars.

1392
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
-

1393
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
A group of escaped convicts

1394
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
saved a city of millions

1395
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:07.000
on the small island nation
of Corto Maltese today.

1396
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000
That's my dad.

1397
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Because of these people.

1398
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Corto Maltese will have
free democratic elections

1399
01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:18.000
for the first time in 90 years.

1400
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Viva Corto Maltese!

1401
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
Viva Corto Maltese!

1402
01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Viva Corto Maltese! Viva...

1403
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:29.000
-That's my dad.
-...Corto Maltese! Viva...

1404
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000
Yeah.

1405
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Yeah.

1406
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Oh. that's just a taste
of what's on that drive.

1407
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:48.000
I've uploaded it all
to a secure server.

1408
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Now. if you kill any one of us.

1409
01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
or my daughter ever sees
the inside of a prison.

1410
01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:54.000
it goes public.

1411
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
If we all go free.

1412
01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
it never has to see
the light of day.

1413
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
I told you I'd make you
a leader. DuBois.

1414
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
You got a deal.

1415
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Nanaue.

1416
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Look. I know Flag wanted to
give the drive to the press.

1417
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
but we just saved
a whole bloody city.

1418
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
We can't have it all.

1419
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Flag was my friend.

1420
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Mine too.

1421
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
And I haven't got
many of those.

1422
02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I could be your friend. Milton.

1423
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Not my name.

1424
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
What?

1425
02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
What are you talkin' about?
We just had a conversation

1426
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:10.000
for. like. three hours
about how your name is Milton.

1427
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Didn't.

1428
02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Yes. we did.

1429
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
No. Our ride's here.

1430
02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
-Hmm.
-

1431
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Nom nom?

1432
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Really?

1433
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
That is what you're
thinkin' about right now?

1434
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:26.000
No. That nom nom though.

1435
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000
No. it's not nom nom.

1436
02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
No!

1437
02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
About a fancy car

1438
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Me to you

1439
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.000
About how far you are

1440
02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Come through for you

1441
02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Another birthday party

1442
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.000
When we're older

1443
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Just a dream

1444
02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:41.000
To be loved by you

1445
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
To be loved by you. by you

1446
02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.000
To be loved by you

1447
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
In the sky again

1448
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
To the diaphragm

1449
02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
And lie again. whoa

1450
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
You're my nightmare

1451
02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
She don't fight fair

1452
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
That you'd notice my despair

1453
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000
I don't care 'cause

1454
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.000
The violence

1455
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.000
They invite the silence

1456
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:31.000
I need some guidance

1457
02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Don't stand a chance

1458
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Don't stand a chance

1459
02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
The upper hand

1460
02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.000
I'm a sick joke

1461
02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000
And I can't cope

1462
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Poke with my kinfolk

1463
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.000
I'm a sick joke

1464
02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000
And I can't cope

1465
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000
'Cause it broke. whoo!

1466
02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:46.000
The upper hand

1467
02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Said they found him
in the rubble.

1468
02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
They were shocked
his heart was still beating.

1469
02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.000
I wasn't certain
how safe it was.

1470
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
shipping him back here.

1471
02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:04.000
But. if anything.
he's shown he's resilient.

1472
02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
It'll take some surgery.

1473
02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
but eventually we'll get him
back up to speed.

1474
02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
You realize
this is revenge. right?

1475
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Waller knows
we double-crossed her.

1476
02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:14.000
and she's getting back at us

1477
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
by saddling us
with this douchebag.

1478
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.000
Yep.

1479
02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
I heard he was sort of a hero
down in Corto Maltese.

1480
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Oh. is that what you heard?
Because not quite.

1481
02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
What do you guys
want him for?

1482
02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Just to save
the fucking world. that's all.
