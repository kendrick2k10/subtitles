3
00:05:33.602 --> 00:05:34.515
Woman: Tomaz?

4
00:06:51.341 --> 00:06:53.906
Oi. why don't you lot
fuck off back home?

5
00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:12.471
First day?

6
00:07:13.776 --> 00:07:15.123
Watch your toes.

7
00:07:15.558 --> 00:07:17.167
It's dangerous work. man.

8
00:08:57.515 --> 00:08:58.471
Tomaz: Halt!

9
00:09:03.428 --> 00:09:05.080
Halt!

10
00:09:30.645 --> 00:09:33.080
- Get out of here. now!

11
00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.471
Fire! It's everywhere!

12
00:10:27.732 --> 00:10:29.210
Woman: Who tied you up?

13
00:10:29.776 --> 00:10:32.471
Tomaz: Friends. It was a joke.

14
00:10:33.863 --> 00:10:35.689
Woman: How long
have you been here?

15
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:41.645
Tomaz: I'm not sure. Two years?

16
00:10:51.645 --> 00:10:52.862
I had a bag.

17
00:10:53.689 --> 00:10:54.819
Speak to the orderly.

18
00:10:54.993 --> 00:10:56.515
She said there's
a message for you.

19
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.036
Like the lamb.
he did return into the fold.

20
00:12:21.297 --> 00:12:23.428
Into the blessed light.

21
00:12:26.775 --> 00:12:28.254
I hope I got them all.

22
00:12:31.123 --> 00:12:32.080
Tomaz: Thank you.

23
00:12:36.775 --> 00:12:39.645
There are many like you
who seek refuge here.

24
00:12:44.862 --> 00:12:47.689
The war is over.
I could go back.

25
00:12:47.862 --> 00:12:49.471
Why don't you?

26
00:12:55.818 --> 00:12:57.036
Thank you for this.

27
00:12:58.993 --> 00:13:00.689
You're a philosopher.

28
00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:04.036
No. I'm a builder.

29
00:13:07.254 --> 00:13:08.210
Really?

30
00:13:10.123 --> 00:13:11.775
Is something missing?

31
00:13:15.993 --> 00:13:17.515
I had some money.

32
00:13:17.689 --> 00:13:20.731
Uh... I didn't find
any money. I'm afraid.

33
00:13:28.428 --> 00:13:29.384
Thank you.

34
00:13:33.993 --> 00:13:37.167
Forward is not
the only way. Tomaz.

35
00:13:39.645 --> 00:13:41.167
There are other roads.

36
00:14:08.341 --> 00:14:09.297
Come on.

37
00:14:43.297 --> 00:14:44.602
Claire: Magda.

38
00:14:45.818 --> 00:14:49.036
My dear child.
it has been too long.

39
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.775
It has been a month. Sister.

40
00:14:53.384 --> 00:14:55.993
I told you.. Magda.

41
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:58.905
My work at the church...

42
00:14:59.384 --> 00:15:01.862
Yours is not the only
suffering. child.

43
00:15:03.123 --> 00:15:06.818
Anyway. I come bearing gifts.

44
00:15:07.818 --> 00:15:09.036
Who is he?

45
00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:11.905
This is Tomaz.

46
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.167
He wants to help you.
don't you. Tomaz?

47
00:15:14.905 --> 00:15:17.254
You have no need
to fear him. my dear.

48
00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.471
It is time.

49
00:15:41.036 --> 00:15:43.558
Claire: Oh. you've made
your first mistake here. Tomaz.

50
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:46.471
You'll learn not to refuse
Magda's cooking.

51
00:15:49.644 --> 00:15:50.818
It's meat.

52
00:16:05.428 --> 00:16:06.905
Did she eat today?

53
00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:09.993
Nothing past her lips all week.

54
00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:12.515
Something has upset her?

55
00:16:14.254 --> 00:16:16.297
She knows the end is coming.

56
00:16:21.254 --> 00:16:23.644
Magda's mother
lives on the top floor.

57
00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:27.297
Unfortunately. she's an invalid.

58
00:16:28.036 --> 00:16:30.905
She's very ill
and in great pain.

59
00:16:31.905 --> 00:16:33.557
Unable to leave the house.

60
00:16:35.123 --> 00:16:37.949
Magda is tasked with the sole
responsibility of her care.

61
00:16:38.123 --> 00:16:40.384
It is a tremendous strain.

62
00:16:40.818 --> 00:16:43.254
Especially as her mother
doesn't like Magda to...

63
00:16:44.297 --> 00:16:45.471
socialize.

64
00:16:51.036 --> 00:16:53.297
The Lord will take her soon.

65
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:12.949
Claire: Peace. quiet.
home-cooked food.

66
00:17:13.123 --> 00:17:15.384
What more
could the bachelor want?

67
00:17:52.993 --> 00:17:53.993
How much?

68
00:17:56.254 --> 00:17:57.993
Magda: We don't need your money.

69
00:17:59.993 --> 00:18:01.210
Sure you don't.

70
00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:05.297
Claire: I told you.
didn't I? At no charge!

71
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.167
If you just help a bit
in the house.

72
00:18:07.341 --> 00:18:09.384
'cause it's falling down
around their ears!

73
00:18:19.341 --> 00:18:20.993
I must go to her.

74
00:18:27.123 --> 00:18:28.470
Tomaz: She doesn't want me here.

75
00:18:28.644 --> 00:18:29.905
Claire: What we want

76
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.688
isn't always
what we need. Tomaz.

77
00:18:33.123 --> 00:18:35.167
I won't go
where I'm not welcome.

78
00:18:39.993 --> 00:18:41.167
Fair enough.

79
00:18:42.731 --> 00:18:44.514
It's getting late. We should go.

80
00:18:44.993 --> 00:18:48.210
You... Fetch the child.
would you?

81
00:20:09.123 --> 00:20:11.080
Magda: We don't have
electricity.

82
00:20:11.383 --> 00:20:13.167
Only gas to heat water.

83
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:15.644
No electricity.

84
00:20:16.296 --> 00:20:19.688
Mother. once her pain
was so great. she tried to...

85
00:20:20.383 --> 00:20:22.254
put her fingers in the sockets.

86
00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:09.123
It's stew.

87
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.427
Mm!

88
00:21:49.296 --> 00:21:52.123
I don't want you to wait on me.

89
00:21:54.253 --> 00:21:56.080
That's not why I'm here.

90
00:21:56.253 --> 00:21:57.993
Magda: Why are you here?

91
00:22:03.775 --> 00:22:05.644
Tomaz: To help you.

92
00:22:08.383 --> 00:22:09.993
Mother won't like it.

93
00:23:52.862 --> 00:23:54.166
Run. if you like.

94
00:23:56.383 --> 00:23:57.688
I won't chase you.

95
00:24:02.296 --> 00:24:06.470
The nearest village
is two days' walk that way.

96
00:24:08.993 --> 00:24:10.905
But I don't think
you want to go there.

97
00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:22.775
Help yourself.

98
00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:34.818
If you're heading
for the border.

99
00:24:34.993 --> 00:24:36.514
you'll never get across.

100
00:24:36.688 --> 00:24:38.644
They'll shoot you the second
you leave the trees.

101
00:24:39.079 --> 00:24:40.035
Why even try?

102
00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:47.296
My daughter is there.

103
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.470
Tomaz: They say a peace deal
is coming.

104
00:24:56.296 --> 00:24:57.601
That it's months away.

105
00:25:00.644 --> 00:25:03.122
You can stay here. wait.

106
00:25:04.775 --> 00:25:06.557
Then you'll be able to cross.

107
00:25:17.166 --> 00:25:18.905
My mother is a dentist.

108
00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:21.905
The Captain who came
with the first brigade.

109
00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:24.383
she did a good job for his caps.

110
00:25:27.862 --> 00:25:29.601
That's how I got sent out here.

111
00:25:31.079 --> 00:25:33.209
She didn't want you
to play soldier?

112
00:26:34.035 --> 00:26:35.166
They're gone.

113
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:27.731
Breakfast.

114
00:29:29.296 --> 00:29:33.730
Thank you. Maybe later.
My stomach is...

115
00:29:34.948 --> 00:29:39.253
I haven't eaten a meal
like that in a long time.

116
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:42.383
What do you usually eat?

117
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:46.948
Don't really get hungry.

118
00:29:55.296 --> 00:29:56.514
What is that?

119
00:29:57.861 --> 00:30:00.688
Magda: We make it into tea.
It calms her.

120
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:16.427
Mm.

121
00:31:39.948 --> 00:31:43.079
- Don't touch that!
- Look. I want to help you!

122
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.774
Don't be like that.
It's natural.

123
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.861
There is a real problem
with the water.

124
00:31:54.035 --> 00:31:55.557
I didn't ask you to come here.

125
00:36:08.253 --> 00:36:09.209
A rat?

126
00:36:10.687 --> 00:36:11.992
Rat with wings...

127
00:36:13.687 --> 00:36:15.122
it's a bat of course.

128
00:36:18.296 --> 00:36:19.817
You haven't seen one before?

129
00:36:20.253 --> 00:36:21.513
In the house?

130
00:36:23.339 --> 00:36:24.339
No.

131
00:36:25.556 --> 00:36:28.556
I spent one year in the woods.
I used to see them all the time.

132
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:31.513
but I've never seen one
like this.

133
00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:36.166
Can you take it away. please?

134
00:36:37.992 --> 00:36:40.079
- Outside?
- Mm.

135
00:36:48.253 --> 00:36:49.209
Thank you.

136
00:37:32.948 --> 00:37:34.166
Tomaz: She beats you?

137
00:37:44.643 --> 00:37:45.730
She's in pain.

138
00:37:47.948 --> 00:37:49.295
That's no excuse.

139
00:37:59.469 --> 00:38:00.730
When I was young...

140
00:38:02.382 --> 00:38:08.166
I remember feeling all the time
that she didn't want me.

141
00:38:09.861 --> 00:38:12.948
That she would get away
if she could.

142
00:38:16.948 --> 00:38:22.904
And yet she fed me.
she cared for me.

143
00:38:35.252 --> 00:38:37.208
Are you going to care
for me too?

144
00:39:21.165 --> 00:39:22.600
Found it in the woods.

145
00:39:25.687 --> 00:39:26.992
Must be old.

146
00:39:28.426 --> 00:39:29.774
A women guard.

147
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:37.687
Woman: An amulet.

148
00:39:39.426 --> 00:39:41.426
Perhaps she will protect me.

149
00:39:53.904 --> 00:39:54.904
Morning.

150
00:39:57.687 --> 00:40:00.992
I'm going to the market.
You want to come?

151
00:40:01.904 --> 00:40:03.208
What is that?

152
00:40:04.948 --> 00:40:06.513
Use this old thing.

153
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.992
Tomaz:
How long have you lived here?

154
00:40:17.904 --> 00:40:18.948
Magda: Many years.

155
00:40:20.687 --> 00:40:22.817
The house belonged
to a man we knew.

156
00:40:23.904 --> 00:40:26.774
But he left one day. suddenly.

157
00:40:29.382 --> 00:40:30.904
Tomaz: Did he leave it to you?

158
00:40:31.948 --> 00:40:33.252
I don't know.

159
00:40:36.339 --> 00:40:40.078
I guess maybe we find out
if anyone comes to take it back.

160
00:40:41.774 --> 00:40:43.992
Woman: Alright. love you.
You have a good day.

161
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:48.687
These ones.

162
00:40:52.643 --> 00:40:55.774
And... this.

163
00:41:00.035 --> 00:41:00.992
This one.

164
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.121
Mm.

165
00:41:06.513 --> 00:41:07.687
Do you like it here?

166
00:41:08.556 --> 00:41:09.643
I don't know it.

167
00:41:10.382 --> 00:41:13.034
This is as far as I've been
since the day we arrived.

168
00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:19.295
You never go out?

169
00:41:50.513 --> 00:41:52.034
What are you looking at?

170
00:41:59.252 --> 00:42:00.513
Magda: It's a love story.

171
00:42:01.513 --> 00:42:03.426
You can borrow it if you want?

172
00:42:04.252 --> 00:42:06.774
I've read it many times before.

173
00:42:07.252 --> 00:42:10.774
No thanks.
I'm not into romance.

174
00:42:11.643 --> 00:42:14.513
Men think romance is silly.
don't they?

175
00:42:16.643 --> 00:42:20.034
They think it's not real love.

176
00:42:21.687 --> 00:42:22.948
But what is love?

177
00:42:24.948 --> 00:42:25.948
Sacrifice.

178
00:42:27.121 --> 00:42:28.643
Tomaz: Nobody's romance.

179
00:42:31.078 --> 00:42:32.339
It's an offering.

180
00:42:35.556 --> 00:42:37.078
What do you write?

181
00:42:39.121 --> 00:42:40.382
In your room?

182
00:42:44.991 --> 00:42:46.904
I can hear you at night.

183
00:42:55.513 --> 00:42:56.991
It's my dissertation.

184
00:42:58.469 --> 00:42:59.730
For my doctorate.

185
00:43:01.252 --> 00:43:02.643
And what's it about?

186
00:43:05.817 --> 00:43:08.643
Philosophy. the study of ideas.

187
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:12.730
I know what philosophy is.

188
00:43:19.078 --> 00:43:21.426
Dare to declare who you are.

189
00:43:23.252 --> 00:43:26.426
It is not far
from the shore of silence

190
00:43:27.382 --> 00:43:29.034
to the boundaries of speech.

191
00:43:30.556 --> 00:43:34.208
The path is not long.
but the way is deep.

192
00:43:36.252 --> 00:43:38.295
You must not only walk there...

193
00:43:40.339 --> 00:43:42.034
you must take a leap.

194
00:44:46.816 --> 00:44:48.121
You are bleeding.

195
00:44:50.426 --> 00:44:51.774
Do you see it?

196
00:44:52.947 --> 00:44:54.339
Magda: I don't see anything.

197
00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:02.121
This shell...

198
00:45:06.556 --> 00:45:11.339
In the old times. it was painted
on the sides of houses

199
00:45:11.513 --> 00:45:13.947
as a warning against evil.

200
00:45:17.034 --> 00:45:18.339
And in the war. they...

201
00:45:21.121 --> 00:45:22.513
They used it again.

202
00:45:27.208 --> 00:45:29.252
Did you kill people in the war?

203
00:45:41.947 --> 00:45:44.078
It's a sin to waste your life.

204
00:45:52.469 --> 00:45:56.382
If I were free.
I would dance every night.

205
00:45:57.991 --> 00:45:59.991
I would go to nightclubs.

206
00:46:16.121 --> 00:46:18.773
You've got to take pleasure
where you can.

207
00:46:20.208 --> 00:46:21.165
Right?

208
00:46:28.382 --> 00:46:30.556
Magda: Mama? Mama!

209
00:46:33.947 --> 00:46:36.729
- Magda: Mama!

210
00:48:44.947 --> 00:48:46.903
There were wires in the wall.

211
00:48:48.339 --> 00:48:50.165
I thought I'd got them all.

212
00:49:03.816 --> 00:49:06.991
Are you shocked
to see her like this?

213
00:49:11.339 --> 00:49:12.903
It's not my choice.

214
00:49:16.208 --> 00:49:19.947
It has to be this way.
otherwise she harms herself.

215
00:49:23.382 --> 00:49:25.121
Tomaz: What is wrong with her?

216
00:49:26.121 --> 00:49:27.642
You don't understand.

217
00:49:28.947 --> 00:49:30.903
She used to be so beautiful.

218
00:49:46.991 --> 00:49:47.991
You see.

219
00:50:18.991 --> 00:50:22.078
- Tomaz: Why didn't you tell me?

220
00:50:22.339 --> 00:50:23.860
This is crazy.

221
00:50:28.426 --> 00:50:29.903
Please don't go.

222
00:51:13.426 --> 00:51:15.686
Tomaz:
Why didn't you go with her?

223
00:51:16.729 --> 00:51:17.686
Your daughter?

224
00:51:19.295 --> 00:51:22.903
Woman: Her father took her
across the border to safety.

225
00:51:23.078 --> 00:51:25.034
He couldn't hide us
both in the car.

226
00:51:36.599 --> 00:51:37.512
You're married?

227
00:51:39.555 --> 00:51:40.555
No.

228
00:51:42.555 --> 00:51:43.555
We divorced.

229
00:51:44.382 --> 00:51:46.555
Why are you still
wearing your ring?

230
00:51:48.816 --> 00:51:51.382
I put my ring back on
when the soldiers came.

231
00:51:52.382 --> 00:51:54.078
I thought it would protect me.

232
00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:01.512
Tomaz:
You worked in the Town Hall?

233
00:52:10.512 --> 00:52:13.468
I had to get papers
for my university application.

234
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.034
I waited an hour in that line.

235
00:52:20.165 --> 00:52:22.816
You never looked up
once from your work.

236
00:52:24.381 --> 00:52:27.425
I wanted you to look up.
but the whole time I was there.

237
00:52:27.642 --> 00:52:29.599
you never did.

238
00:52:36.686 --> 00:52:41.252
My daughter.
I always had to leave at 5:00.

239
00:52:44.816 --> 00:52:46.468
You never saw me?

240
00:52:51.773 --> 00:52:53.121
I don't remember you.

241
00:54:29.816 --> 00:54:30.991
You're back.

242
00:54:34.165 --> 00:54:35.686
The house needs work.

243
00:54:44.294 --> 00:54:46.338
Can you make her
some tea tonight?

244
00:54:47.381 --> 00:54:48.294
Why?

245
00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:51.512
I don't want to eat
alone any more.

246
00:55:37.381 --> 00:55:38.860
She's sleeping.

247
00:55:42.425 --> 00:55:43.947
I made cake too.

248
00:55:44.121 --> 00:55:46.729
Lucky I'm so greedy.

249
00:55:54.425 --> 00:55:56.294
Do you have any other shoes?

250
00:55:57.207 --> 00:55:58.164
Shoes?

251
00:55:59.773 --> 00:56:01.338
You can't dance in those.

252
00:56:09.468 --> 00:56:12.207
Tomaz: Thank you.
Where did you get it?

253
00:56:13.947 --> 00:56:15.599
Magda: The house
is full of things.

254
00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.381
Very few of them are ours.

255
00:59:31.425 --> 00:59:32.773
You are running.

256
00:59:33.686 --> 00:59:34.686
Why?

257
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:41.903
You think I know nothing
of the world. you are wrong.

258
00:59:42.773 --> 00:59:45.468
The very worst troubles.
secrets.

259
00:59:46.773 --> 00:59:49.946
The deepest pains of existence
find their way into these walls.

260
00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.077
This is not a sanctuary.

261
00:59:52.946 --> 00:59:54.251
This is a crucible.

262
00:59:57.946 --> 00:59:59.642
You can tell me.

263
01:00:06.381 --> 01:00:07.642
I made a mistake.

264
01:00:10.686 --> 01:00:11.946
We all do.

265
01:00:14.816 --> 01:00:16.816
I tried to help someone.

266
01:00:21.077 --> 01:00:22.468
They got hurt.

267
01:00:27.946 --> 01:00:31.946
Maybe you need to go home.

268
01:00:32.207 --> 01:00:34.251
There are other ways.

269
01:00:36.338 --> 01:00:38.990
- I am afraid.
- There are worse things.

270
01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:45.164
Before your God...

271
01:00:46.599 --> 01:00:50.120
the Ancients. they didn't
believe that you could.

272
01:00:51.425 --> 01:00:52.381
What?

273
01:00:55.555 --> 01:00:56.686
Forgive yourself.

274
01:00:57.686 --> 01:00:59.251
It wasn't yours to give.

275
01:01:01.686 --> 01:01:03.164
What do you believe?

276
01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.859
No. no. no. no.

277
01:02:01.077 --> 01:02:03.120
No. I can't.

278
01:02:06.729 --> 01:02:09.512
- What are you talking about?
- Please don't.

279
01:02:10.946 --> 01:02:13.468
Tomaz. what's wrong?

280
01:02:18.207 --> 01:02:19.555
Don't be afraid.

281
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:42.468
She can see us.

282
01:02:45.902 --> 01:02:49.599
Mama. don't be angry

283
01:02:50.902 --> 01:02:53.946
I know it hurts.
but who will care for me

284
01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.033
after you're gone?

285
01:02:58.033 --> 01:02:58.990
Let go.

286
01:03:05.468 --> 01:03:06.425
Mother.

287
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:16.381
The end is coming.

288
01:03:21.728 --> 01:03:23.033
Tomaz: I'll call the police.

289
01:03:23.512 --> 01:03:24.468
Magda: No!

290
01:03:26.207 --> 01:03:27.381
No-one else!

291
01:03:28.642 --> 01:03:29.642
Promise...

292
01:03:30.772 --> 01:03:31.815
Promise me.

293
01:03:32.512 --> 01:03:34.946
Swear it. Swear it.

294
01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:50.859
It's always like this.
around her time.

295
01:04:58.555 --> 01:05:00.033
I should have known.

296
01:05:09.859 --> 01:05:12.164
Jesus Christ.

297
01:05:28.815 --> 01:05:29.946
I have to.

298
01:05:30.946 --> 01:05:32.772
They're born with teeth.

299
01:05:47.946 --> 01:05:49.207
Claire: A demon.

300
01:05:52.902 --> 01:05:54.425
Do you know what a demon is?

301
01:05:56.512 --> 01:05:59.164
The demon's essence is evil.

302
01:05:59.554 --> 01:06:00.946
Pure evil.

303
01:06:01.815 --> 01:06:03.772
But evil isn't simply
an idea. Tomaz.

304
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:06.120
Through its body.

305
01:06:06.554 --> 01:06:09.815
it delivers evil.

306
01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:13.728
It becomes tangible.

307
01:06:15.772 --> 01:06:17.077
It bites.

308
01:06:18.338 --> 01:06:20.990
Magda is its slave?

309
01:06:25.468 --> 01:06:27.815
Claire: These creatures
can live centuries.

310
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.381
They need to be cared for.

311
01:06:30.077 --> 01:06:33.338
They need... companionship.

312
01:06:38.815 --> 01:06:40.772
But it's nearing the end now.

313
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:43.164
It is dying. Finally.

314
01:06:44.772 --> 01:06:46.468
So Magda will be free?

315
01:06:47.554 --> 01:06:50.468
No Master will let its slave
outlive it.

316
01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:55.685
This is my duty.

317
01:06:56.598 --> 01:06:59.859
Has been our duty
through the ages.

318
01:07:00.728 --> 01:07:01.728
Duty?

319
01:07:02.381 --> 01:07:05.077
Evil must be contained. Tomaz.

320
01:07:08.294 --> 01:07:12.902
So you gave her to that thing?

321
01:07:13.467 --> 01:07:15.685
I tried to make things
bearable for them.

322
01:07:22.598 --> 01:07:23.990
Why am I here?

323
01:07:25.685 --> 01:07:27.207
It is your destiny.

324
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:53.077
Claire:
You will protect her. won't you?

325
01:08:16.902 --> 01:08:18.077
You're back.

326
01:08:23.554 --> 01:08:24.511
Again.

327
01:08:29.251 --> 01:08:30.467
Why are you here?

328
01:08:31.294 --> 01:08:33.859
- To free you.
- And how will you do it?

329
01:08:36.685 --> 01:08:37.859
I will kill it.

330
01:08:38.424 --> 01:08:40.077
What if it kills you first?

331
01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:45.338
It's weak. Dying. she said.

332
01:08:46.554 --> 01:08:47.598
You're a coward.

333
01:08:49.946 --> 01:08:51.251
You don't know me.

334
01:08:57.772 --> 01:08:59.772
You know nothing about me
at all.

335
01:11:23.728 --> 01:11:24.728
Don't.

336
01:11:25.772 --> 01:11:27.250
Leave him be.

337
01:11:33.641 --> 01:11:35.467
We belong together.

338
01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.598
There's no escape.

339
01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:15.206
Tomaz.

340
01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.990
You have to go now.

341
01:12:23.685 --> 01:12:24.728
I will not.

342
01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.077
Leave us.

343
01:13:02.815 --> 01:13:03.990
What are you doing?

344
01:13:07.946 --> 01:13:10.033
You'll die out there
in the woods.

345
01:13:11.077 --> 01:13:12.424
Or they will catch you.

346
01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:16.424
Thank you for all you've
done for me.

347
01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.641
You're a good man.

348
01:13:38.033 --> 01:13:38.990
You can't go.

349
01:13:46.163 --> 01:13:47.119
Why?

350
01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:52.424
You need me.

351
01:14:07.902 --> 01:14:10.598
Don't run.

352
01:14:18.772 --> 01:14:19.772
Don't.

353
01:14:48.815 --> 01:14:51.772
- How long have I...?
- Two days.

354
01:15:02.728 --> 01:15:04.467
I failed you.

355
01:15:18.598 --> 01:15:20.380
I told myself...

356
01:15:23.554 --> 01:15:25.511
if I could free you...

357
01:15:28.206 --> 01:15:30.989
then I would have a right
to be happy again.

358
01:15:39.119 --> 01:15:40.380
Listen to me.

359
01:15:45.728 --> 01:15:47.206
There is something...

360
01:15:53.859 --> 01:15:55.337
inside me...

361
01:15:58.337 --> 01:16:00.380
and it's stronger than me.

362
01:16:06.119 --> 01:16:09.772
I have not always done...

363
01:16:12.598 --> 01:16:13.598
right.

364
01:16:20.598 --> 01:16:21.598
But...

365
01:16:24.424 --> 01:16:26.076
I'm a good man. Magda.

366
01:16:30.554 --> 01:16:31.989
I am a good man.

367
01:17:36.511 --> 01:17:38.598
Magda: You slept like a baby.

368
01:17:41.511 --> 01:17:43.206
Tomaz: I didn't dream.

369
01:17:45.685 --> 01:17:47.424
Magda: You forgave yourself.

370
01:18:39.641 --> 01:18:41.250
Claire:
You'll feel better now.

371
01:18:46.858 --> 01:18:48.511
Better out than in.

372
01:18:49.467 --> 01:18:50.685
That's what they say. isn't it?

373
01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:54.554
Oh. yes. do you like it?

374
01:18:54.728 --> 01:18:56.163
Such a relief!

375
01:18:56.467 --> 01:18:59.250
Never felt I totally convinced
as a nun.

376
01:18:59.728 --> 01:19:01.554
I never quite got the...

377
01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:04.598
Couldn't get the walk.

378
01:19:07.685 --> 01:19:08.858
Who are you?

379
01:19:09.467 --> 01:19:14.119
Someone you're going
to get to know very well.

380
01:19:19.728 --> 01:19:21.163
What is happening to me?

381
01:19:23.641 --> 01:19:24.901
Let's have a look.

382
01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:49.467
As I said.
a demon's essence is evil.

383
01:19:52.814 --> 01:19:54.641
Why?

384
01:19:57.206 --> 01:19:59.511
I think you know the answer
to that. don't you?

385
01:20:35.337 --> 01:20:36.511
Claire: So...

386
01:20:37.945 --> 01:20:40.250
let's get started.

387
01:20:42.641 --> 01:20:45.771
I wonder who the lucky girl
will be.

388
01:20:47.032 --> 01:20:49.684
What do you think you'll be
wanting in your candidates?

389
01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:51.424
Candidates?

390
01:20:51.684 --> 01:20:53.337
Companion. of course.

391
01:21:00.901 --> 01:21:01.989
I want her.

392
01:21:04.206 --> 01:21:07.901
She has served her time.

393
01:21:09.814 --> 01:21:12.814
Anyway I thought you wanted
to free her.

394
01:21:13.032 --> 01:21:14.424
I want her.

395
01:21:19.727 --> 01:21:21.511
She is still taken.

396
01:21:27.293 --> 01:21:28.424
I want her.

397
01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:31.727
Well...

398
01:21:34.076 --> 01:21:35.945
you'd better go
and finish it then.

399
01:25:43.684 --> 01:25:45.901
Magda: The house belonged
to a man we knew.

400
01:25:50.293 --> 01:25:52.640
But he left one day. suddenly.

401
01:25:56.163 --> 01:25:57.510
Where did you get it?

402
01:26:07.336 --> 01:26:09.032
Magda: The house
was full of things.

403
01:26:10.076 --> 01:26:11.771
Very few of them were ours.

404
01:26:21.945 --> 01:26:23.163
Tomaz: The shell...

405
01:26:24.293 --> 01:26:26.945
was a warning against evil.

406
01:28:20.814 --> 01:28:22.684
Magda: Welcome. Tomaz.

407
01:28:26.684 --> 01:28:29.249
Don't you find me beautiful
anymore?

408
01:28:31.814 --> 01:28:35.205
You used to find me beautiful. didn't you?

409
01:28:40.423 --> 01:28:44.205
Isn't this what you wanted.
Tomaz?

410
01:29:24.814 --> 01:29:26.771
It comes so quick.

411
01:29:28.076 --> 01:29:29.640
Magda: He was ripe.

412
01:29:30.249 --> 01:29:31.640
You chose well.

413
01:29:34.989 --> 01:29:37.162
They chose their own path.

414
01:29:39.901 --> 01:29:42.162
You had every chance. boy.

415
01:29:44.292 --> 01:29:45.553
Please.

416
01:29:51.292 --> 01:29:53.162
Ate well. didn't you?

417
01:29:54.032 --> 01:29:58.032
Well. now it's time to pay
for your meal.

418
01:30:32.814 --> 01:30:34.989
Don't be scared Tomaz.

419
01:30:37.727 --> 01:30:40.205
You'll make a wonderful mother.

Kind of.

We didn't have any tourists
for a long time.

437
01:32:09.118 --> 01:32:10.771
But now they're coming back.

That's good.

Yeah. I guess.

Forget and move on.
