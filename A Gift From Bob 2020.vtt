00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.107
{\an8}Champagne?

5
00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:06.084
{\an8}Aw. Look!

6
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.884
Bob! Gorgeous.

7
00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:15.928
- Yes. Isn't he adorable?
- Ooh.

8
00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:17.513
Look at that.

9
00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.770
Oh! Bob the cat!

10
00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.189
Look at that.

11
00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:29.775
There he is.

12
00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.944
There's great demand
for his work right now.

13
00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:37.324
This way!
Thank you. sir. Perfect.

14
00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:54.675
Can I have everybody's attention.
please?

15
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:56.677
Thank you.

16
00:02:56.718 --> 00:03:00.597
Welcome. everybody. to our
annual authors' Christmas party.

17
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.141
Hear. hear.

18
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:04.643
Hear. hear.

19
00:03:05.394 --> 00:03:08.647
Some of you are familiar faces
and some of you are new.

20
00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.692
and it is such a pleasure
to see all of you here today.

21
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.360
It's going to be a tremendous evening.

22
00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.279
- with some fabulous speakers.
- Oh. yeah. Thanks. mate.

23
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.114
But I would first like to welcome...

24
00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:19.366
- Here you are. Bob. Shh.
- ...one of our new authors.

25
00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:22.244
James Bowen. and his companion. Bob.

26
00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:27.666
Well done. There you go.

27
00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:33.213
The story of how these two lost souls
met and saved each other

28
00:03:33.255 --> 00:03:35.048
here on the streets of London

29
00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:38.135
has touched readers
from all over the world.

30
00:03:38.177 --> 00:03:40.179
And we are delighted to announce

31
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.807
that James is hard at work on
his new book about their adventures.

32
00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:44.933
Aren't you. James?

33
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:48.270
Which we cannot wait to publish
next August.

34
00:03:55.194 --> 00:03:56.904
What are we doing here. mate?

35
00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:03.744
So. erm. Mr Bowen. what does
the big day hold in store for you?

36
00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.413
Oh. you know.
turkey with the trimmings. I guess.

37
00:04:06.455 --> 00:04:07.539
in front of the TV.

38
00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.124
Pigs in blankets for him.

39
00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:11.084
So. nothing special. then?

40
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:13.337
Oh. that's pretty special for us.

41
00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.255
Of course. I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

42
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.634
Can I say hello to Bob?

43
00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.552
Oh. Jacqueline Wilson.

44
00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.304
Hello. Jacqueline.

45
00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:23.680
- Hi.
- Yeah. of course.

46
00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:26.099
Thank you. Hello. Bob.

47
00:04:26.642 --> 00:04:29.561
- Love your books.
- Oh. That's so nice.

48
00:04:29.603 --> 00:04:31.939
Not Bob. obviously. Can't read.

49
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.649
But. erm. yeah.

50
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.443
I see you're sneaking away.
I don't blame you.

51
00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:38.445
Such a posh invite. Couldn't say no.

52
00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:42.157
I know. Congratulations. though.
on your new book.

53
00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.993
Or should I say commiserations?

54
00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.121
- I recognised the look on your face.
- You did?

55
00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.123
You haven't started it yet. have you?

56
00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:53.961
Not yet. no.
I can't. erm. settle on a story.

57
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:58.632
I know the feeling.
I'm sure you'll get an idea soon.

58
00:04:58.674 --> 00:05:01.343
They often happen
when you least expect it.

59
00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:03.971
So. good luck with it. anyway.

60
00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.681
Thank you. Lovely to meet you.

61
00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:06.974
And you too.

62
00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:16.692
Aw. Merry Christmas. Jay!

63
00:05:17.526 --> 00:05:20.195
Come and get your mulled wine.

64
00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:27.786
Nice cat. mate.

65
00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.166
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

66
00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.269
Ready. ladies and gentlemen?
Here we go.

67
00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:54.479
That's it. Like that.

68
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.815
Can you believe this man?

69
00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.567
Merry Christmas.

70
00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.486
- Get off!
- Get his legs!

71
00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.947
- I haven't done anything. Get off me.
- You're causing a scene.

72
00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.491
- Hold him down.
- Get off me.

73
00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:07.951
I haven't done anything.
You're hurting me. Get off.

74
00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:09.286
You're causing a scene.
all right? Stay down.

75
00:06:09.328 --> 00:06:10.329
- Stay down.
- I haven't done anything.

76
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.914
Stay down.
Or you're gonna hurt yourself.

77
00:06:11.955 --> 00:06:14.791
- Hey! Hey! What's going on?
- Hold him. Hold...

78
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.043
Why are you holding
him down on the ground like this?

79
00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.086
Does it need three of you. really?

80
00:06:18.128 --> 00:06:21.632
Well. well. well. If it isn't cat boy.

81
00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:24.301
- Long time no see.
- It's you.

82
00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.470
Still your old charming self. I see.

83
00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:28.347
Tell you what.
you can sling your hook right away.

84
00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:29.848
All right.
what's going on?

85
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.934
Just standard stuff. really. love.

86
00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:35.145
Er. illegal busker. Got a bit punchy.
but we calmed him down.

87
00:06:35.187 --> 00:06:37.523
- What's wrong with you?
- Excuse me. Officer.

88
00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:40.192
- I thought I told you to piss off.
- Do you know this person?

89
00:06:40.234 --> 00:06:42.152
No. but I'm pretty sure
he wasn't breaking the law.

90
00:06:42.194 --> 00:06:44.363
Yeah. he was busking over there.
in Camden.

91
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:45.697
not there
in the Borough of Westminster.

92
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:46.740
And?

93
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.951
And you need a permit
to busk in Westminster.

94
00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.078
- You don't need one in Camden.
- Oh.

95
00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.830
- All right. phone it in.
- Look. this is stupid.

96
00:06:53.872 --> 00:06:56.208
Can we just charge this guy
and then we can all go home?

97
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.584
Charge him with what?
Playing his guitar?

98
00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.169
You knew he was legal. didn't you?

99
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:00.295
<i>Control.
That's confirmed.</i>

100
00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:01.547
He's right. Let him go.

101
00:07:01.588 --> 00:07:03.590
Let. let him go? Let him go?

102
00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:07.052
- It's unbelievable.
- That's assault.

103
00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:09.888
- I wanna press charges.
- Walk away. Just walk away. Trust me.

104
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.973
Calm down.
He hasn't done anything wrong.

105
00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.350
- But he's getting away.
- I said calm down.

106
00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:22.526
So what's the story?
Are you Harry Potter's lawyer?

107
00:07:22.568 --> 00:07:25.279
- Excuse me? Mm.
- All that legal stuff.

108
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.823
Borough of this and that.
and a magic cat on your shoulder.

109
00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:29.783
Let's just say
I'm familiar with the law.

110
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:32.661
It's a pretty chill cat.

111
00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.205
Most of the time.

112
00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:37.082
Yeah.

113
00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:39.251
Saw him giving the eye
to that dickhead back there.

114
00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.545
- Yeah.
- He knows you. doesn't he?

115
00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:43.797
Yeah. Ghost of Christmas Past.

116
00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:46.425
Him and Bob and me
have a bit of history.

117
00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:48.343
Bob.

118
00:07:50.596 --> 00:07:52.014
That's one house burger.

119
00:07:53.473 --> 00:07:55.684
- Can I get the bill. please?
- Yes. right away.

120
00:07:55.726 --> 00:07:57.227
- And a saucer?
- Mm-hm.

121
00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:58.478
Thank you.

122
00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:05.527
They do serve
something resembling food

123
00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:06.904
at the Christmas shelters. you know.

124
00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:08.405
That obvious. eh?

125
00:08:09.239 --> 00:08:10.908
Haven't been to a shelter since this.

126
00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:17.122
Stanley knife. Sliced straight through
my sleeping bag.

127
00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:20.125
Lucky they only took my money belt.

128
00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:21.877
OK.

129
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.090
Have you tried Monmouth Street?

130
00:08:27.508 --> 00:08:30.511
There's a warm air vent
above the kitchen to that hotel.

131
00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:32.513
You're one of them outreach workers.

132
00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.224
No. God squad?

133
00:08:35.265 --> 00:08:36.892
I used to be in the same boat as you.

134
00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.559
I was homeless too.

135
00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.229
I ended up on heroin.

136
00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:43.649
Junkies. Hate 'em.

137
00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.026
Not as much as they hate themselves.

138
00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:50.739
So how'd you get clean? Magic cat?

139
00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:53.617
He helped me get clean.

140
00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:55.536
learn a few lessons I needed to learn.

141
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.080
Like that.

142
00:08:58.121 --> 00:09:00.415
Fall down seven times. get up eight.

143
00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.002
Except sometimes you can't.

144
00:09:04.962 --> 00:09:06.630
Cos you've got nothing to get up for.

145
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.716
Cos you feel like you're nothing.
got nothing to give.

146
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.969
- I know. I know.
- You don't know anything.

147
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.389
I don't know why I came here.
Just so someone else can preach at me.

148
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.183
That is all anyone does.
especially at this time of year.

149
00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:21.687
I should have just let them
bang me up over Christmas.

150
00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:24.064
Sit down. OK? Finish your food.

151
00:09:24.982 --> 00:09:28.318
All right. Just give me five minutes.
No preaching. cross my heart.

152
00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:30.195
Just a story.

153
00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:33.532
OK? Sit down.

154
00:09:34.658 --> 00:09:35.909
Five minutes.

155
00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:42.624
It was a few years ago.
After I got clean.

156
00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:45.502
The last Christmas
me and Bob worked on the streets.

157
00:10:16.992 --> 00:10:19.536
Yeah. Don't blame you. mate.

158
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.000
Not even a please?

159
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.010
Sorry. mate. Guess we're out.

160
00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:38.866
No. No. no. no. Oi. you.

161
00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:41.702
Stay there. Stay there. OK?

162
00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:43.370
Back before you know it.

163
00:12:15.194 --> 00:12:16.862
Don't let the elephants out.

164
00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:21.074
Ah. Where is my good friend Bob?

165
00:12:21.408 --> 00:12:23.869
He. er. sent me
to fetch his breakfast.

166
00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:27.706
Hmm. I told you he was
the wise one round here.

167
00:12:31.084 --> 00:12:32.419
What time do you close tonight?

168
00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:34.213
I've gotta top up
my electric after work.

169
00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:35.589
Er. 10:00.

170
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.592
Got a late delivery. Christmas stock.

171
00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:40.761
Another week of that word.

172
00:12:41.762 --> 00:12:45.349
Hmm. Not exactly
my favourite time of year either.

173
00:12:49.895 --> 00:12:52.189
Oh.

174
00:12:52.523 --> 00:12:54.900
Oh. it's the anniversary.
I'm sorry. Moody.

175
00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.443
Ah. it's OK.

176
00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.154
Anyway.

177
00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:01.532
Christmas is all right.

178
00:13:02.241 --> 00:13:05.160
We have all to believe
in something. Hmm?

179
00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:07.913
Christmas. Krishna.

180
00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:11.625
Cricket.

181
00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.503
I suppose I'm Buddish.

182
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.338
Buddish?

183
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.675
Yeah. I sort of believe in Buddhism.

184
00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.802
Karma. all that kind of stuff.

185
00:13:21.844 --> 00:13:23.846
Ah. Karma.

186
00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:26.348
What goes around comes around.

187
00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:28.392
Like the poor butter maker.

188
00:13:28.934 --> 00:13:30.769
Why do I feel
one of your stories coming on?

189
00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:33.981
He was a farmer.

190
00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:36.066
His best customer was a shop owner

191
00:13:36.108 --> 00:13:39.361
who ordered one kilo of butter
every month.

192
00:13:39.695 --> 00:13:45.242
In return. he paid the farmer
flour. beans and...

193
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:50.914
one kilo of sugar.

194
00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:52.791
OK.

195
00:13:52.833 --> 00:13:55.210
One day. the shop owner
weighed the butter.

196
00:13:55.252 --> 00:13:58.422
but it was only 900 grams. not a kilo.

197
00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.257
Ooh. he got very angry.

198
00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:02.634
"I am going to call
the police on you."

199
00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:05.804
The farmer. he was polite.

200
00:14:06.471 --> 00:14:08.056
He said he was a poor man.

201
00:14:08.098 --> 00:14:10.017
couldn't afford to buy the weights
for his scales.

202
00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:13.020
so he measured the butter
with the only weight he had.

203
00:14:14.897 --> 00:14:15.981
The kilo of sugar.

204
00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:17.524
Exactly.

205
00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:21.904
Do good. it will be repaid.

206
00:14:21.945 --> 00:14:24.281
- Do bad...
- Less butter on your bread.

207
00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:28.827
Here.

208
00:14:30.204 --> 00:14:31.830
- For Bob.
- Aww.

209
00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:33.081
Merry Krishna.

210
00:14:33.457 --> 00:14:34.458
Thank you.

211
00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.722
<i>♪ Oh. bring us
some figgy pudding</i>

212
00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:50.474
<i>♪ Oh. bring us some figgy pudding</i>

213
00:14:50.516 --> 00:14:52.851
<i>♪ Oh. bring us some figgy pudding</i>

214
00:14:52.893 --> 00:14:55.229
<i>♪ And bring it right here</i>

215
00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:58.649
<i>♪ We wish you a merry Christmas</i>

216
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.945
<i>♪ We wish you a merry Christmas
A merry Christmas and... ♪</i>

217
00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:05.280
Oh. surprise!

218
00:15:05.322 --> 00:15:07.824
- Bloody hell.
- I used your spare key.

219
00:15:08.617 --> 00:15:11.286
Do you like it? I thought
you could use some Christmas cheer.

220
00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:13.830
There's a lot of things
I could use right now.

221
00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:16.500
Like getting my gas
and hot water back on.

222
00:15:17.668 --> 00:15:19.920
Haven't had a shower in three days.

223
00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:22.005
Thought there was
a nasty niff in the air.

224
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.050
Come on. Good boy.

225
00:15:25.092 --> 00:15:26.802
Nan always did this in my family.

226
00:15:26.844 --> 00:15:30.389
Bits of wisdom. prayers.
wishes for the New Year.

227
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.975
You write things
you were thankful for in the old one

228
00:15:33.016 --> 00:15:34.309
and then you just hang them
on the tree.

229
00:15:37.729 --> 00:15:39.356
"Thank you for James's friendship."

230
00:15:40.232 --> 00:15:41.525
See? It's not so bad.

231
00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:44.570
"Angels are all around us
if we just know where to look."

232
00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:46.697
Seriously?

233
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.410
You really don't like the holidays.
do you. Ebenezer Grinchface?

234
00:15:53.495 --> 00:15:56.915
I need to work out what's gonna keep
me and Bob going for the month.

235
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:04.006
Fifteen...

236
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.724
Go on. then. Grinchface.
Give us the news.

237
00:16:14.099 --> 00:16:16.059
I need 200 quid to last the month.

238
00:16:16.727 --> 00:16:17.853
What?

239
00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:22.149
Fifteen to get gas and electric back.
Then four quid a day.

240
00:16:22.191 --> 00:16:24.401
Bus and tube. say 40 quid.

241
00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:26.445
Papers to sell
during the Christmas rush.

242
00:16:26.486 --> 00:16:27.905
Two weeks' food for me and Bob.

243
00:16:27.946 --> 00:16:29.990
- Call that 50 more.
- OK.

244
00:16:30.032 --> 00:16:33.452
It's been ages since he's had
a check-up. Gotta see a vet soon.

245
00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:35.996
Still seems a lot.
Especially the heating.

246
00:16:36.788 --> 00:16:37.998
Earth to Bea.

247
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.666
We're in the worst cold snap
for years.

248
00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:41.585
Earth to Grinchface.

249
00:16:42.002 --> 00:16:45.380
Homeless guy came in to us last week
with frostbite. He lost three toes.

250
00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:48.258
I got given this place
for a good reason. you know.

251
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.344
And no one is regretting
giving it to you.

252
00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:53.347
It was a big step.
and they were happy to help.

253
00:16:54.223 --> 00:16:55.349
Hold on.

254
00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:03.398
A friend. Dr Becky.

255
00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.318
She's doing a free vet clinic
at the project on Friday.

256
00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.361
Bring Bob.

257
00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:16.954
If you two are still speaking.

258
00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:36.223
OK. mate. You stay there. all right?
It's cold out.

259
00:17:45.357 --> 00:17:47.985
No. Bob. Bob. Stay. Stay.

260
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.076
All right. mate.

261
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.829
Come on. then.

262
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.457
Come on. then. Let's go.

263
00:18:11.717 --> 00:18:14.011
- There's your daddy.
- Hey. darling. How'd you get on?

264
00:18:14.052 --> 00:18:17.472
Well. she did very good. but we have
to stop giving her all those treats.

265
00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:18.724
OK.

266
00:18:19.183 --> 00:18:20.475
OK.

267
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:23.478
A tale of two kitties. eh. Bob?

268
00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:26.523
If I could afford it.
I would. you know.

269
00:18:47.544 --> 00:18:49.129
- Spare some change?
- No. mate.

270
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:50.797
- Hey. James.
- Hey.

271
00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.925
- Busking in town?
- Maybe later.

272
00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.801
- See how the papers go first.
- Ah.

273
00:18:55.052 --> 00:18:57.429
- You've got competition today.
- Yeah.

274
00:18:58.013 --> 00:19:00.265
Any spare change for fighting poverty?

275
00:19:00.307 --> 00:19:01.892
- Hey. mate. You got any spare change?
- No.

276
00:19:02.684 --> 00:19:05.729
No? You got a nice suit. though.
Any spare change? No?

277
00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:07.856
All right. Bob.

278
00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:09.733
Good boy.

279
00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:13.779
- Hello. love. you all right?
- OK. Bob.

280
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.364
Get your blanket out.

281
00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.659
Here you are. Bob. Good boy.

282
00:19:19.243 --> 00:19:20.744
Any spare change?

283
00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:24.873
All right. mate. There you go.

284
00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:31.129
- Good boy.
- Any spare change would help.

285
00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:36.468
- <i>Big Issue. Big Issue!</i>
- Spare change?

286
00:19:37.135 --> 00:19:39.680
- They're nice and Christmassy.
- Yeah. I like it.

287
00:19:41.056 --> 00:19:43.600
- Give it a try. Help or buy.
- It's getting busy. isn't it?

288
00:19:43.642 --> 00:19:45.769
- <i>Big Issue.</i> madam?
- Everyone's got a gimmick.

289
00:19:46.562 --> 00:19:49.398
<i>Big Issue! Big Issue.</i> sir?

290
00:19:49.439 --> 00:19:50.941
- Hello. James.
- Hi. Irene.

291
00:19:50.983 --> 00:19:52.234
Hello. Bob.

292
00:19:53.277 --> 00:19:55.571
- Bit hectic today.
- Yeah. nightmare.

293
00:19:55.612 --> 00:19:57.781
- Well. must be off.
- See you.

294
00:19:57.823 --> 00:19:58.866
Bye. Bob.

295
00:19:58.907 --> 00:20:00.701
<i>Big Issue. Big Issue.</i> madam?

296
00:20:00.742 --> 00:20:03.120
- <i>Big Issue. Big Issue.</i> madam?
- Ah. God bless you. God bless you.

297
00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:05.122
Any spare change. please?
Every little helps.

298
00:20:05.163 --> 00:20:07.499
Hey. Watch where you're stepping.

299
00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:09.293
Oh. piss off. mate.
I can step where I like.

300
00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:10.460
Just be careful is all I'm saying.

301
00:20:10.502 --> 00:20:12.129
You shouldn't have
your stupid cat in the way.

302
00:20:12.171 --> 00:20:14.047
- Mate. I'm just trying to work here.
- Well. yeah. So am I.

303
00:20:14.089 --> 00:20:15.883
Right. OK. Idiot.

304
00:20:17.634 --> 00:20:19.678
What'd you say? Huh?
You want some. then. eh?

305
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.138
- Come on. then. Let's have it.
- Hey. James. no.

306
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.390
Just walk away. OK?
I'm just trying to work here.

307
00:20:23.432 --> 00:20:25.601
- We can't have this out here.
- He just nearly stepped on Bob.

308
00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:27.811
- It shouldn't be in the way.
- I've never heard of that charity.

309
00:20:27.853 --> 00:20:29.813
James. people are watching.
People are watching.

310
00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.899
- You should watch yourself. mate.
- Can you go?

311
00:20:32.691 --> 00:20:34.943
- All of them are just scammers.
- I know.

312
00:20:34.985 --> 00:20:38.322
Listen. why don't you just come back
and do this tomorrow?

313
00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:41.408
You're not gonna sell anything
anyway. not with this lot round.

314
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.035
- Yeah.
- OK? Sorry.

315
00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:46.330
No. you're probably right.

316
00:20:46.371 --> 00:20:48.290
This way sir. Yeah.

317
00:20:48.665 --> 00:20:51.293
- Yeah. Looking very good.
- Look into the lens. please. sir.

318
00:20:51.793 --> 00:20:54.838
Oh. What a splendid cat.

319
00:20:55.714 --> 00:20:58.008
Ah.

320
00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.761
Ah. Sorry. He's a bit hungry.

321
00:21:00.802 --> 00:21:04.598
Ah. Well. I'll tell you what...

322
00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:09.520
Now. you buy her something lovely
to eat tonight. OK?

323
00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:10.771
- Thank you so much.
- Jolly good.

324
00:21:10.812 --> 00:21:12.731
Let's get a photograph. shall we?

325
00:21:13.357 --> 00:21:16.151
- Make it a good one.
- Great. Fabulous. Great.

326
00:21:16.985 --> 00:21:18.237
Right. very good.

327
00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:20.531
Er. well. happy Christmas
to both of you.

328
00:21:20.572 --> 00:21:22.449
- And you. Thank you.
- There we are!

329
00:21:22.491 --> 00:21:23.575
This way. sir!

330
00:21:23.617 --> 00:21:24.618
Give us
a smile! Lovely.

331
00:21:32.876 --> 00:21:34.086
Mug.

332
00:21:43.846 --> 00:21:45.097
Look at that.

333
00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:48.433
A thousand... something.

334
00:22:05.075 --> 00:22:07.160
- I'd like to change this. please.
- Sure.

335
00:22:09.288 --> 00:22:11.582
Have you
seen one of these before?

336
00:22:11.623 --> 00:22:13.750
It's an Albanian lek.

337
00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:16.253
Well. it's one thousand Albanian lek.

338
00:22:16.795 --> 00:22:18.505
- Albanian lek.
- Lek.

339
00:22:18.922 --> 00:22:23.552
Which converts to just over seven...

340
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.346
seven pounds sterling.

341
00:22:26.889 --> 00:22:30.017
Er. seven pounds and 55 pence.
to be precise.

342
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.104
OK. Yeah. I'll take it.

343
00:22:34.146 --> 00:22:36.982
Well. we need our commission.
I'm afraid.

344
00:22:37.024 --> 00:22:40.319
You see. we have a ten-pound minimum.
I'm sorry.

345
00:22:41.737 --> 00:22:44.323
But you could try
the Albanian embassy. maybe.

346
00:22:45.741 --> 00:22:48.785
- Do you know where it is?
- You could Google it.

347
00:22:49.786 --> 00:22:50.913
Thanks.

348
00:22:51.663 --> 00:22:53.081
I like your cat.

349
00:23:31.245 --> 00:23:33.539
I've just explained.
I've already been to four shops.

350
00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.541
- They're not selling it anywhere.
- Oh.

351
00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.210
- Some woman.
- Hey. Bloody hell.

352
00:23:38.544 --> 00:23:40.546
- Are you OK?
- I'll look in one other shop...

353
00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:42.005
Yes. Yeah.

354
00:23:43.382 --> 00:23:45.551
- Thank you.
- Lunatic.

355
00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:47.845
Look. we can. erm... Down here.

356
00:23:47.886 --> 00:23:49.972
- I just didn't see him coming.
- No.

357
00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:51.682
- Obviously.
- Erm...

358
00:23:51.723 --> 00:23:54.101
- You. er. you hold onto Bob.
- Ooh. Yes.

359
00:23:54.768 --> 00:23:56.854
- OK.
- Hello.

360
00:24:00.524 --> 00:24:01.650
Some people. eh?

361
00:24:01.692 --> 00:24:04.069
Just don't look
where they're going.

362
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:06.488
There you are.

363
00:24:07.072 --> 00:24:09.157
Thank you so much. Thank you.

364
00:24:09.199 --> 00:24:10.742
That's OK. Don't thank me. Thank Bob.

365
00:24:11.285 --> 00:24:13.996
Don't miss a thing. do you. mister?

366
00:24:14.037 --> 00:24:15.122
What a character you are.

367
00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:17.583
sitting there without a care
in the world.

368
00:24:18.375 --> 00:24:20.335
- OK. can I...
- Yes.

369
00:24:20.752 --> 00:24:23.672
Come on. then. Bob.
Let's go. Let's go. Bob. Let's go.

370
00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:25.757
OK.

371
00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:28.218
Oh. Hang on. I'm sorry. Erm...

372
00:24:29.386 --> 00:24:31.555
Oh. blast. I never have any cash.

373
00:24:31.597 --> 00:24:34.057
Oh. don't worry. It's fine. honestly.
It's OK.

374
00:24:34.099 --> 00:24:36.476
Well. what's your spot? I could pop by

375
00:24:36.518 --> 00:24:39.479
and buy a magazine
or listen to you play.

376
00:24:39.813 --> 00:24:43.108
Er. Covent Garden.
or Angel. outside the tube.

377
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:45.861
Angel. Of course.

378
00:24:47.154 --> 00:24:49.656
- OK. Hope you're OK.
- Thank you.

The cat's had no say about
whether it's out here or not. has it?

390
00:25:32.282 --> 00:25:33.992
Well.
he doesn't have to do anything.

391
00:25:34.034 --> 00:25:35.327
He's just sat there.

392
00:25:36.328 --> 00:25:39.706
All I'm saying. love. is that
that cat does not look happy to me.

393
00:25:40.082 --> 00:25:43.252
Poor little moggy.
I mean. it's freezing out here.

394
00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:45.963
And imagine being stuck
with a waster like that.

395
00:25:46.004 --> 00:25:48.841
I mean. if you ask me.
people like that.

396
00:25:48.882 --> 00:25:50.384
they shouldn't even be allowed
to own a hamster.

397
00:25:50.425 --> 00:25:54.012
Look. I don't know who you pissed off
to get you transferred to us.

398
00:25:54.054 --> 00:25:56.431
but you stick to the driving
and I'll stick to the animals.

399
00:25:56.473 --> 00:25:58.267
And. please. don't call me that.

400
00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:01.562
- All right. Sorry. sweetheart.
- Give me strength.

401
00:26:01.603 --> 00:26:03.814
No! Come here!

402
00:26:03.856 --> 00:26:05.148
Oi. oi. Here we go.

403
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.276
Get him away from my cat.

404
00:26:07.317 --> 00:26:09.236
Come back here you... Oi. Titan!

405
00:26:09.278 --> 00:26:11.238
- Hey. can you control your dog?
- You stupid mutt.

406
00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.490
That's what I'm talking about.
He's endangering that cat.

407
00:26:13.532 --> 00:26:15.409
- Dragging him out here.
- Fine.

408
00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.494
You're animal welfare. aren't you?
Why don't you do something?

409
00:26:17.536 --> 00:26:19.663
Fine. We'll pay him
a proper visit later.

410
00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:21.540
But first let's sort out
this comedian.

411
00:26:22.374 --> 00:26:24.084
What's the matter with you?

412
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.675
- Light there. yeah?
- Light here?

413
00:26:33.177 --> 00:26:35.137
It's a bit smudged
there. yeah?

414
00:26:36.555 --> 00:26:40.017
That's good. man.
Do the side bit here.

415
00:26:40.225 --> 00:26:42.227
Here you go. Bob. Look.

416
00:26:43.061 --> 00:26:44.771
Hey. look. Food.

417
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:49.234
Hey. Bob. what's the matter?
You not hungry?

418
00:26:50.068 --> 00:26:52.905
Hey. what's the matter? Are you OK?

419
00:26:53.697 --> 00:26:55.574
Hey? Are you hurt?

420
00:26:56.575 --> 00:26:58.368
Did that dog do this?

421
00:26:59.244 --> 00:27:00.454
OK.

422
00:27:01.288 --> 00:27:03.081
Little bit of cold in there as well.

423
00:27:04.249 --> 00:27:06.293
Gonna get a bit of this in.

424
00:27:07.544 --> 00:27:08.921
Yeah.

425
00:27:09.838 --> 00:27:13.342
It's gonna be nice. Bob.
Yeah. Nice bubbles.

426
00:27:13.383 --> 00:27:16.136
Nice. Nice bit of water.

427
00:27:16.178 --> 00:27:18.180
Get you all clean.
Look at that. Right.

428
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:22.559
OK. Let's get this up here.

429
00:27:23.435 --> 00:27:26.188
And then... You gonna come in?

430
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.315
Come on. Come on. Bob.

431
00:27:28.357 --> 00:27:31.276
Sorry. mate. You haven't got a choice.
You gotta do this.

432
00:27:31.318 --> 00:27:33.403
Can't let that get infected.
Come on. Bob.

433
00:27:33.737 --> 00:27:37.115
Come on. Bob. There you go. Good boy.

434
00:27:37.157 --> 00:27:39.409
See? Not so bad. is it?

435
00:27:39.952 --> 00:27:42.496
There you go. Good boy.

436
00:27:43.622 --> 00:27:47.209
Good boy. There you are.
Now you like it. Well done. Bob.

437
00:27:48.335 --> 00:27:49.753
Here. look.

438
00:27:50.087 --> 00:27:52.589
There you go. Bob. Good boy.
Good boy.

439
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.593
OK. take you out.

440
00:27:56.885 --> 00:27:59.263
There you go. Good boy.

441
00:27:59.847 --> 00:28:01.765
Let's get you wrapped up in a towel.

442
00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:11.316
Yeah. just checking me socials.

443
00:28:13.318 --> 00:28:15.070
Oh. I like the jumper.

444
00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:18.657
Wow. Grinchface found
a sense of humour. Hello. handsome.

445
00:28:18.949 --> 00:28:20.534
I thought I'd take you up
on the offer.

446
00:28:20.576 --> 00:28:22.619
- The vet. It's today. right?
- What vet?

447
00:28:22.661 --> 00:28:24.413
- What?
- No. I'm just kidding.

448
00:28:24.454 --> 00:28:26.623
It is today. Right over there.

449
00:28:27.332 --> 00:28:29.459
- You setting up for Christmas dinner?
- Yeah.

450
00:28:29.501 --> 00:28:32.838
We're expecting about 60.
Some telly. board games...

451
00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.381
Ah. I love a bit of Monopoly.

452
00:28:34.423 --> 00:28:37.050
Well. you know what they say.
"All property is theft."

453
00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:39.386
I'll leave you to it.
Come find me later.

454
00:28:39.428 --> 00:28:40.554
OK.

455
00:28:56.528 --> 00:28:58.989
No. leave the chicken alone.
Don't look at the chicken.

456
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.034
OK. who's next?

457
00:29:04.036 --> 00:29:06.246
So. this is the famous Bob.

458
00:29:06.288 --> 00:29:08.832
- I've heard a lot about you.
- All good. I hope.

459
00:29:08.874 --> 00:29:10.167
Yeah. Yeah. all good.

460
00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:11.835
So. how's he doing?

461
00:29:12.503 --> 00:29:14.713
Actually. he got
a bit of a scratch yesterday.

462
00:29:14.755 --> 00:29:16.381
Erm. a dog went for him.

463
00:29:16.423 --> 00:29:18.592
I don't know if it was that
or he got caught trying to get away.

464
00:29:18.634 --> 00:29:19.927
Just back here.

465
00:29:20.594 --> 00:29:22.763
Erm. I didn't notice it
till I got home.

466
00:29:23.931 --> 00:29:25.974
Let's have a look.

467
00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:28.894
- It's OK. mate. You're OK.
- Ooh. Yeah. I see.

468
00:29:29.144 --> 00:29:31.772
Yeah. it's not much. but you're right
to come and get it looked at.

469
00:29:31.813 --> 00:29:33.774
There's always a danger of infection.

470
00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:35.484
All right. well.
why don't you leave him with me?

471
00:29:35.526 --> 00:29:38.195
- Erm... I'll be ten minutes.
- OK.

472
00:29:38.237 --> 00:29:40.155
You be good.

473
00:29:41.073 --> 00:29:42.908
I'll take care of you. Bob.

474
00:29:59.466 --> 00:30:02.177
- Need a hand?
- That'd be good. yeah.

475
00:30:12.771 --> 00:30:14.273
What's that saying?

476
00:30:15.274 --> 00:30:18.110
"Christmas isn't a season.
It's a feeling."

477
00:30:19.528 --> 00:30:21.947
I shouldn't fall for it. really.
but I do.

478
00:30:23.323 --> 00:30:24.449
Every year.

479
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.705
Go on. then.
I can tell you're dying to.

480
00:30:29.746 --> 00:30:33.125
No. it's fine.
Whatever you're feeling. It's cool.

481
00:30:41.508 --> 00:30:45.262
I blame Nan. She lived for Christmas.

482
00:30:45.512 --> 00:30:47.806
Started soaking
her plum pudding in brandy in August.

483
00:30:47.848 --> 00:30:48.891
Hmm.

484
00:30:50.058 --> 00:30:52.019
Decorations up
the day after Bonfire Night.

485
00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:56.023
Felt sorry for me. I think.
Being fostered.

486
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.151
Had to give me twice the Christmas
normal kids got.

487
00:31:00.194 --> 00:31:01.361
I don't know.

488
00:31:02.446 --> 00:31:05.199
Maybe it's in my DNA.
revering the ancestors and all.

489
00:31:09.203 --> 00:31:11.413
Whatever form your family takes.

490
00:31:11.997 --> 00:31:13.916
that's what Christmas is about.
I think.

491
00:31:14.917 --> 00:31:16.210
It's important.

492
00:31:19.171 --> 00:31:20.589
Bit different for you. then?

493
00:31:22.799 --> 00:31:26.428
I woke up one Christmas morning
in a psychiatric ward.

494
00:31:28.096 --> 00:31:29.556
<i>Didn't know where I was.</i>

495
00:31:30.933 --> 00:31:32.684
<i>Doctor standing over me
with a needle...</i>

496
00:31:33.685 --> 00:31:36.355
of God knows what. Then...

497
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.650
zoning out again.

498
00:31:42.069 --> 00:31:43.362
How old were you?

499
00:31:45.656 --> 00:31:48.367
Six. Seven.

500
00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:00.838
Tested me for schizophrenia. bipolar.

501
00:32:03.674 --> 00:32:07.052
That's it. then?
No other Christmas memories?

502
00:32:09.096 --> 00:32:11.390
I remember hearing my dad's voice
on the phone one year.

503
00:32:14.268 --> 00:32:16.019
<i>From the other side
of the world.</i>

504
00:32:18.272 --> 00:32:19.940
Wishing he was in the next room.

505
00:32:23.819 --> 00:32:24.820
But he wasn't.

506
00:32:30.534 --> 00:32:34.454
Look at that. It's one of
the richest places on the planet.

507
00:32:36.039 --> 00:32:37.374
Someone's down there right now

508
00:32:37.416 --> 00:32:40.002
blowing two grand on a bottle of wine.

509
00:32:40.294 --> 00:32:43.630
Yeah. and I'll send home
a family of five

510
00:32:43.672 --> 00:32:46.466
with macaroni and tinned fruit
to last them a week.

511
00:32:47.593 --> 00:32:48.760
Go figure.

512
00:32:50.387 --> 00:32:53.807
Doesn't add up.
It's like some of us are invisible.

513
00:32:55.058 --> 00:32:56.685
No. they know we're here.

514
00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.856
- Why else puts spikes on doorways?
- Mm.

515
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:03.692
They just want us out of sight.

516
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:08.113
Yeah.

517
00:33:14.828 --> 00:33:17.039
- I should. erm...
- Yeah.

518
00:33:22.961 --> 00:33:25.672
Right. Well. I have cleaned him up

519
00:33:25.714 --> 00:33:28.509
and I've given him
an injection of antibiotic.

520
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.636
He might be sore for a day or two.

521
00:33:30.677 --> 00:33:33.055
but other than that
he's in really good nick.

522
00:33:33.722 --> 00:33:36.266
- Hear that. Bob? High five.
- Mm-hm.

523
00:33:36.308 --> 00:33:37.434
Five.

524
00:33:37.726 --> 00:33:39.895
High five. Thanks a lot.

525
00:33:39.937 --> 00:33:42.564
Come on. then. mister.
OK. come on. then. On we go.

526
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.735
- Good boy. Thank you very much.
- Pleasure.

527
00:33:51.073 --> 00:33:54.076
It's gonna be a good day today. Bob.
I can feel it.

528
00:33:57.663 --> 00:33:59.831

00:34:01.416 --> 00:34:03.293

- No.

Oh. Irene. That's. erm...

Good afternoon.

589
00:38:21.802 --> 00:38:25.430
I'm Animal Welfare Officer Davies.
This is my colleague. Mr Booth.

590
00:38:25.472 --> 00:38:27.766
We wanted to chat to you
about a couple of concerns.

591
00:38:27.808 --> 00:38:30.227
- What sort of concerns?
- Ooh. I'm sure it'll be fine.

592
00:38:30.269 --> 00:38:32.604
Just wanna make sure
he's happy. healthy.

593
00:38:32.646 --> 00:38:34.898
Yeah. course he is. Look at him.

594
00:38:35.399 --> 00:38:37.025
- What's his name?
- Er. Bob.

595
00:38:37.985 --> 00:38:39.528
- Bob. Nice to meet you.
- Bob.

596
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.071
If it's OK.
I'd like to take a look at him.

597
00:38:41.113 --> 00:38:43.365
- maybe take a couple of photos?
- Yep.

598
00:38:43.407 --> 00:38:44.825
Shall I take him to the van. yeah?

599
00:38:44.867 --> 00:38:46.702
Leave it. Leon.

600
00:38:48.287 --> 00:38:51.290
- Bob. Bob. no.
- It's OK. Bob.

601
00:38:51.331 --> 00:38:54.376
- Just gotta be slow.
- Hey. that's OK.

602
00:39:02.593 --> 00:39:05.053
Ah. he had an injection there
the other day.

603
00:39:05.095 --> 00:39:07.306
- He might be a bit sore.
- Injection?

604
00:39:07.806 --> 00:39:10.726
Yeah. he had a little scratch.
I don't know what from.

605
00:39:10.767 --> 00:39:12.936
But the vet just wanted to give him
some antibiotics

606
00:39:12.978 --> 00:39:14.688
just to make sure
it didn't get infected.

607
00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:17.107
- You got the paperwork for that?
- Yeah. at home.

608
00:39:17.357 --> 00:39:18.775
I can send it on to you.

609
00:39:18.817 --> 00:39:20.652
Yeah. Here are my details.

610
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:23.530
- Can I get yours as well?
- Er. yeah.

611
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:25.949
Is Bob microchipped?

612
00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.119
Er. yeah. under my name. James Bowen.

613
00:39:29.411 --> 00:39:31.121
Sorry. I've just gotta turn this on.

614
00:39:31.163 --> 00:39:33.916
You need to keep that on
in case we need you.

615
00:39:34.208 --> 00:39:36.960
Is there anyone else we could talk
to. someone that knows you and Bob?

616
00:39:37.294 --> 00:39:40.005
Er. my friend Bea. She works
at a charity on Upper Street.

617
00:39:40.047 --> 00:39:41.882
I can give you her number. Hang on.

618
00:39:47.179 --> 00:39:50.390
- Is there anything else I can do or...
- You could get a haircut.

619
00:39:50.432 --> 00:39:51.433
Ah.

620
00:39:54.019 --> 00:39:57.523
Maybe write a statement.
Er. how long you've had Bob.

621
00:39:57.564 --> 00:39:59.107
What his life is like.
That sort of thing.

622
00:40:00.984 --> 00:40:03.737
- Just in case.
- In case of what?

623
00:40:03.779 --> 00:40:07.282
Well. might get referred
up to the authorities. see.

624
00:40:07.491 --> 00:40:09.159
Might need a court to decide

625
00:40:09.201 --> 00:40:12.079
whether you're fit enough
to keep him or not.

626
00:40:12.788 --> 00:40:14.373
In case I'm good enough to keep?

627
00:40:14.665 --> 00:40:16.500
Of course I can keep...
You can't take him away from me.

628
00:40:16.542 --> 00:40:18.252
No. no. That's where
you're wrong. sunshine. See. we can.

629
00:40:18.293 --> 00:40:19.878
- Hey. Let's... let's... Hey!
- If it's in the cat's best interest...

630
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.963
- Don't touch me.
- ...we can.

631
00:40:21.004 --> 00:40:22.756
- Calm down. Calm down.
- I didn't touch you.

632
00:40:22.798 --> 00:40:24.842
- Both of you calm down. please.
- He's completely fine.

633
00:40:24.883 --> 00:40:27.177
Listen. let's not get ahead
of ourselves. Both of you.

634
00:40:35.227 --> 00:40:37.020
Bea. you gotta help me.

635
00:40:37.396 --> 00:40:39.857
Someone's gonna call you about Bob.
Animal welfare.

636
00:40:39.898 --> 00:40:42.734

Bloke she's with is a total prick.

637
00:40:42.776 --> 00:40:45.112
And. er. I don't know.
I gave them your number.

638
00:40:45.153 --> 00:40:46.405
I said you could vouch for us.

639
00:40:46.446 --> 00:40:50.117
I don't know if someone targeted us
or if they reported me or...

640
00:40:50.534 --> 00:40:52.202
I don't know. Who'd...

641
00:40:54.538 --> 00:40:57.040
- What's the matter?
- Why is it always about you. James?

642
00:41:00.043 --> 00:41:01.128
What's happened?

643
00:41:02.254 --> 00:41:03.547
Look around you.

644
00:41:05.007 --> 00:41:07.509
Break-in last night.
They took everything.

645
00:41:07.801 --> 00:41:11.346
All of our food. telly.
computers. bedding.

646
00:41:12.598 --> 00:41:13.932
Everything they could.

647
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:16.059
I mean. who the hell
steals from a project

648
00:41:16.101 --> 00:41:17.436

649
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:19.938
Can you get more stuff?

650
00:41:20.856 --> 00:41:24.484
With what. James? Shirt buttons?

651
00:41:27.321 --> 00:41:28.572
We haven't got any money.

652
00:41:29.823 --> 00:41:31.533

664
00:43:54.301 --> 00:43:56.094
All right. mate. What do you need?

665
00:43:56.136 --> 00:43:58.514
- No. I'm good.
- Come on. I know you.

666
00:43:58.555 --> 00:44:00.432
- You like the good stuff.
- I said no.

667
00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:03.727
- When did you turn into such a prick?
- Are you gonna piss off?

668
00:44:04.478 --> 00:44:05.646
Or what?

669
00:44:08.023 --> 00:44:09.441

670

- Hey. get off!
- Give me the bag.

671
00:44:12.027 --> 00:44:14.154

- Get off!

672

677
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:45.352

Come on.

678
00:44:56.405 --> 00:44:57.739
Come in. guys. Sit down.

679
00:45:00.659 --> 00:45:04.830
I've just got an email
asking me to comment on this.

680
00:45:06.498 --> 00:45:09.251
Apparently someone sent it
to the local news station.

00:45:17.342 --> 00:45:19.636
Look. this isn't
what it looks like.

684
00:45:19.678 --> 00:45:21.138
It is exactly what it looks like.

685
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.182
It's exactly
the sort of brainless behaviour

686
00:45:23.223 --> 00:45:25.684
that got you transferred here
in the first place.

687
00:45:26.852 --> 00:45:30.022
So. I'm gonna tell you
exactly what happens now.

688
00:45:30.564 --> 00:45:32.983
Ruth. talk to the TV company.

689
00:45:33.567 --> 00:45:36.195
Make a "no comment" comment.

690
00:45:36.236 --> 00:45:39.781
We don't discuss ongoing inquiries.
blah. blah. blah.

691
00:45:39.823 --> 00:45:42.034
- Right.
- And find witnesses.

692
00:45:42.075 --> 00:45:44.536
Anyone who can tell us what the RSPCA
will need to know.

693
00:45:44.578 --> 00:45:46.163
if we pass it up to them.

694
00:45:46.538 --> 00:45:48.540
- Is...
- Bob.

695
00:45:48.582 --> 00:45:51.168
Is Bob in a safe home?

696
00:45:51.585 --> 00:45:54.254
Separated from other animals?
You know the drill.

697
00:45:54.296 --> 00:45:56.423
Oh. I've had some joy
already there. boss.

698
00:45:56.465 --> 00:45:59.384
Spoke to housing.
Mr Bowen's in assisted accommodation.

699
00:45:59.718 --> 00:46:01.887
Keeps it tidy. no other animals.

700
00:46:01.929 --> 00:46:03.305
Is the animal healthy?

701
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.891
I need to check out his story
on taking it to the vet.

702
00:46:05.933 --> 00:46:07.226
but he seemed OK.

703
00:46:08.185 --> 00:46:11.647
OK. Well. keep talking to people.
And remember the law.

704
00:46:11.688 --> 00:46:16.401
Is Bob free to display. and I quote.
"normal behaviour patterns"?

705
00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.072
And as for you. stay out of it.

706
00:46:20.322 --> 00:46:21.865
You might be right
on this one.

707
00:46:21.907 --> 00:46:23.325
but I can't afford to be wrong.

708
00:46:24.117 --> 00:46:26.537
I'm not gonna be plastered
all over the papers.

709
00:46:26.578 --> 00:46:30.165
Cruella de Muswell Hill.
It's not happening.

710
00:46:31.625 --> 00:46:32.793
If a guy who works on the street

711
00:46:32.835 --> 00:46:35.504
is being separated from his cat
at Christmas.

712
00:46:35.546 --> 00:46:37.798
it's got to be done
by the book. Got it?

713
00:46:38.298 --> 00:46:39.716
Yes. boss.

714
00:46:40.801 --> 00:46:41.802
Yes.

715
00:46:42.553 --> 00:46:43.595
Hello.

716
00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:46.139
- Here we are. Is that you. yeah?
- Hello.

717
00:46:46.181 --> 00:46:48.684
Excellent. On you pop.
Nice one. Hello.

718
00:46:48.725 --> 00:46:51.728
Thank you. Hello.
Thank you for a good trip.

719
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.648
There we go. That's you.
In you go. Did you have fun?

720
00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:57.234
- See the sights. yeah?
- So stupid.

721
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.243
See ya.

722
00:47:15.419 --> 00:47:19.173
- Yes. mate. that's the one over there.
- That's the one over there.

723
00:47:19.214 --> 00:47:20.507
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

724
00:47:23.135 --> 00:47:25.721
Yeah. all right. Righto.

725
00:47:32.352 --> 00:47:33.687
There you go.

726
00:47:46.533 --> 00:47:48.869
Oh. no. No. no. no.

727
00:47:50.245 --> 00:47:51.330
Idiot.

728
00:47:53.332 --> 00:47:54.333
Stupid.

729
00:48:15.979 --> 00:48:17.648
That's gone as well.

730
00:48:26.907 --> 00:48:28.242
I'll be right back.

731
00:48:31.995 --> 00:48:34.414
Don't let the elephants out.

732
00:48:35.374 --> 00:48:38.210
Hi. Moody.
Twenty on the electric. please.

733
00:48:39.253 --> 00:48:41.296
Big freeze coming in from Greenland.

734
00:48:41.547 --> 00:48:43.632
Ah. great. When?

735
00:48:44.049 --> 00:48:47.511
End of the week. I think.
Best tune in to the radio.

736
00:48:48.136 --> 00:48:49.137
Thanks.

737
00:48:49.972 --> 00:48:52.599
Er... There you are.

738
00:48:56.562 --> 00:48:59.231
Do you have any tape?
My guitar's bust.

739
00:48:59.273 --> 00:49:00.440
Hmm.

740
00:49:01.316 --> 00:49:03.151
Here. Use mine.

741
00:49:03.402 --> 00:49:04.903
Oh. Thank you.

742
00:49:21.712 --> 00:49:24.214
Bob. no! Ah!

743
00:49:24.256 --> 00:49:26.341
Bob! What have you...

744
00:49:29.261 --> 00:49:30.721
Stinks.

745
00:49:38.478 --> 00:49:39.646
Thank you.

746
00:49:45.277 --> 00:49:47.613
Excuse me. ma'am. Five-minute warning.

747
00:49:47.654 --> 00:49:49.865
- <i>Calm down.</i>
- <i>I'm working here with my cat.</i>

748
00:49:49.907 --> 00:49:52.367
<i>We are conducting
a routine investigation.</i>

749
00:49:52.409 --> 00:49:54.411
<i>but we're also appealing
to the public for help.</i>

750
00:49:54.703 --> 00:49:59.082
{\an8}<i>Anyone who knows the man and the cat
in the video or the photograph.</i>

751
00:49:59.124 --> 00:50:00.667
{\an8}<i>please get in touch...</i>

752
00:50:00.709 --> 00:50:03.754
- Ma'am. five minutes.
- Yes. Sorry. darling. Thank you.

753
00:50:03.795 --> 00:50:05.964
<i>...so that we can resolve
where the cat should be.</i>

754
00:50:14.264 --> 00:50:16.850
<i>And they say there's
a cold front coming in this weekend</i>

755
00:50:16.892 --> 00:50:18.227
<i>just in time for Christmas.</i>

756
00:50:18.268 --> 00:50:20.395
- <i>Might even get a bit of snow.</i>
- Brilliant.

757
00:50:20.437 --> 00:50:23.524
<i>Could be a white Christmas this year.
How do we feel about that?</i>

758
00:50:23.565 --> 00:50:25.526
<i>Hey. it's what
we're dreaming about. right?</i>

759
00:50:25.567 --> 00:50:27.611
<i>You're listening
to the sounds of the season.</i>

760
00:50:27.653 --> 00:50:30.489
<i>Traffic and weather.
together on drive time.</i>

761
00:50:30.531 --> 00:50:33.075
Are you coming. mate?

762
00:50:33.534 --> 00:50:34.743
No?

763
00:50:35.911 --> 00:50:37.621
I'd stay there too if I could.

764
00:50:38.872 --> 00:50:40.499
See you later. monster.

765
00:51:04.773 --> 00:51:06.400
Next batch!

766
00:51:08.068 --> 00:51:10.279
Where shall I put this. Sarah?
Over there?

767
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.780
Just back there.

768
00:51:12.948 --> 00:51:16.451
Sorry. Excuse me. I'm looking
for a Miss Chan. Bea Chan.

769
00:51:16.493 --> 00:51:18.453
- She's just over there.
- Thank you.

770
00:51:20.831 --> 00:51:22.457
It looks pretty full-on.

771
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:26.712
Yeah. it was hard enough.
but we just got burgled as well.

772
00:51:26.753 --> 00:51:28.505
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

773
00:51:29.339 --> 00:51:30.757
It's gonna be a long winter.

774
00:51:30.966 --> 00:51:32.676
Then I'll be as quick as I can.

775
00:51:33.719 --> 00:51:36.597
So. Bea. how long have you known
Mr Bowen and Bob?

776
00:51:36.638 --> 00:51:38.599
Nine months. maybe ten.

777
00:51:39.224 --> 00:51:41.435
I go round to James's flat
fairly regularly.

778
00:51:41.476 --> 00:51:45.189
I see. Is it true that Bob
was recently seen by a vet here?

779
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.984
- Yeah. Dr Becky.
- Bob was injured somehow?

780
00:51:49.026 --> 00:51:50.444
It was just a scratch.

781
00:51:50.485 --> 00:51:54.364
James brought Bob in first thing.
Becky fixed him right up.

782
00:51:55.824 --> 00:51:58.660
- Do you want her number?
- Yes. please.

783
00:51:58.952 --> 00:52:01.872
Erm. so you've known them
almost a year.

784
00:52:02.623 --> 00:52:05.626
Is there anything in Bob's behaviour
that struck you during that time?

785
00:52:05.876 --> 00:52:06.877
In what way?

786
00:52:06.919 --> 00:52:09.880
Well. it's not normal for a cat
to be out on the streets most days.

787
00:52:09.922 --> 00:52:12.841
Bob was a stray. That's where
he lived till he teamed up with James.

788
00:52:12.883 --> 00:52:15.052
Uh. I didn't know that.

789
00:52:15.093 --> 00:52:17.763
But some might say
spending his days with James.

790
00:52:17.804 --> 00:52:20.641
it's not exactly a suitable
environment. not normal behaviour.

791
00:52:22.601 --> 00:52:24.895
You know cats. Obviously.

792
00:52:25.812 --> 00:52:27.773
- Lost mine in the summer.
- Hm.

793
00:52:28.106 --> 00:52:30.817
Dexter. He was a real star.

794
00:52:30.859 --> 00:52:33.070
But. so. yes. I'd say so.

795
00:52:33.445 --> 00:52:35.113
Pretty independent creatures.

796
00:52:35.155 --> 00:52:36.740
Not gonna do anything
they don't wanna do.

797
00:52:36.782 --> 00:52:38.784
Oh. definitely not.

798
00:52:38.825 --> 00:52:42.663
So every day before he leaves home.
James gives Bob the choice.

799
00:52:42.704 --> 00:52:46.208
to stay at home in the warm alone
or go out with him.

800
00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:48.794
And every day. well. almost every day.

801
00:52:49.127 --> 00:52:50.462
Bob goes with him.

802
00:52:50.921 --> 00:52:52.214
And what about James?

803
00:52:52.756 --> 00:52:56.301
Is he... Is his home life stable?

804
00:52:57.302 --> 00:53:01.139
James is no saint.
but he's taken big steps.

805
00:53:01.181 --> 00:53:04.643
And Bob's given him responsibility.
not something he's had before.

806
00:53:05.352 --> 00:53:08.438
Two musketeers.
All for one. one for all.

807
00:53:08.647 --> 00:53:11.525
When James went cold turkey.
Bob never left him for a minute.

808
00:53:12.317 --> 00:53:14.069
Was he using when he had Bob?

809
00:53:14.444 --> 00:53:17.573
He was on the programme. Methadone.

810
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:20.534
Bob gave him the strength
to get clean.

811
00:53:22.327 --> 00:53:26.415
If you were to split them up.
it doesn't bear thinking about.

812
00:53:26.999 --> 00:53:29.835
I don't wanna keep you.
You've been a great help.

813
00:53:30.294 --> 00:53:31.545
Thanks.

814
00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.760
You're not really thinking about
taking Bob away from him. are you?

815
00:53:39.428 --> 00:53:41.138
We need to do what's best for Bob.

816
00:53:41.805 --> 00:53:44.099
It's not only up to me. Sorry.

836
00:55:10.686 --> 00:55:13.230
We're off for a wee Christmas pint.
Want to join us?

Hmph.

840
00:55:22.614 --> 00:55:25.993
Hey. first pint's on me.
Come on. before he defrosts.

841
00:55:26.034 --> 00:55:27.619
- OK.
- Good man.

842
00:55:27.661 --> 00:55:30.914
- Er. not great.
- Tell us all about it.

843
00:55:32.249 --> 00:55:33.292
Thanks. Dave.

844
00:55:33.333 --> 00:55:34.877
See you later. Cheers.
Merry Christmas.

845
00:55:34.918 --> 00:55:37.171
Do you think I'd sell more papers
if I had a cat?

846
00:55:37.462 --> 00:55:39.923
- Erm. I don't think so.
- Sorry.

847
00:55:40.382 --> 00:55:41.675
- All right.
- Sorry.

848
00:55:41.925 --> 00:55:43.802
Listen. suits are your thing.
Look at you.

849
00:55:43.844 --> 00:55:45.971
- Look at the effort that you put in.
- Sorry.

850
00:55:47.097 --> 00:55:50.184
I mean. you could get
a bunny outfit for Easter.

851
00:55:50.225 --> 00:55:53.061
- Sorry.
- Love heart for Valentine's.

852
00:55:53.353 --> 00:55:56.231
Er. Pete. watch you don't melt.
sitting by that fire there.

853
00:55:57.566 --> 00:55:59.735
Cos he's a snowman.

854
00:56:01.653 --> 00:56:02.946
Here. I've got a good one for you.

855
00:56:02.988 --> 00:56:05.073
What do you call a snowman
who works at a bakery?

856
00:56:06.658 --> 00:56:09.578
- A baker.
- It's funny.

857
00:56:10.078 --> 00:56:12.539
- Hm.
- Wow. Tough crowd.

858
00:56:12.915 --> 00:56:15.626
It's funny.
It's funny.

859
00:56:21.465 --> 00:56:25.093
All right. let's hear it.
You got a problem with me?

860
00:56:25.969 --> 00:56:27.012
I don't know. Do I?

861
00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:29.681
You will have
if you don't spit it out.

862
00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:34.520
I know it was you who shopped me
to the animal welfare people.

863
00:56:35.771 --> 00:56:36.980
What?

864
00:56:37.814 --> 00:56:40.651
I saw you the other day
near Covent Garden tube.

865
00:56:41.068 --> 00:56:44.071
Yeah. you and your mate
in the council van. pointing at us.

866
00:56:45.072 --> 00:56:46.907
Why are you helping them
spy on me and Bob?

867
00:56:47.449 --> 00:56:48.450
Spying?

868
00:56:49.493 --> 00:56:50.702
On your cat?

869
00:56:51.912 --> 00:56:53.747
Why would I be spying on your cat?

870
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:55.290
I don't know. You tell me.

871
00:56:55.707 --> 00:56:58.877
White van?

872
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:01.255
James Street?

873
00:57:02.047 --> 00:57:03.215
That was Danny.

874
00:57:03.841 --> 00:57:07.010
He had some work for me.
School had frozen pipes.

875
00:57:07.052 --> 00:57:09.054
Wanted me to thaw 'em out.
Picked me up from there.

876
00:57:10.472 --> 00:57:11.682
Look.

877
00:57:12.558 --> 00:57:14.059
I didn't know you were there.

878
00:57:14.977 --> 00:57:16.478
Hardly worth it. is it?

879
00:57:20.983 --> 00:57:22.442
Fifteen quid.

880
00:57:26.989 --> 00:57:31.451
So. tell me. how did you get the cat?

881
00:57:33.662 --> 00:57:35.247
I found him in my flat.

882
00:57:36.415 --> 00:57:40.252
He was a stray.
He wouldn't leave me alone.

883
00:57:42.713 --> 00:57:44.047
Jammy sod.

884
00:57:44.798 --> 00:57:46.758
Won't deny he pulls in the punters.

885
00:57:47.926 --> 00:57:49.219
I didn't mean that.

886
00:57:50.345 --> 00:57:53.599
I couldn't care what you make.
You're lucky to have him.

887
00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:54.725
Mm-hmm.

888
00:57:55.642 --> 00:57:58.604
When you look after someone. it gives
you purpose. it gives you meaning.

889
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.024
It makes you a better person.

890
00:58:08.238 --> 00:58:09.573
I've got a little girl.

891
00:58:11.366 --> 00:58:12.367
Maisie.

892
00:58:15.078 --> 00:58:17.206
Not so little any more.

893
00:58:21.168 --> 00:58:23.587
And a junked-up teenager
in a Ford Fiesta...

894
00:58:27.508 --> 00:58:30.010
Took me nine months
to walk again. so...

895
00:58:32.095 --> 00:58:33.597
I don't miss much.

896
00:58:34.515 --> 00:58:36.850
Don't miss her mother.

897
00:58:41.813 --> 00:58:42.814
I miss Maisie. though.

898
00:58:47.778 --> 00:58:50.197
So... So where is she now?

899
00:58:50.864 --> 00:58:51.865
Maisie?

900
00:58:52.991 --> 00:58:56.161
West London. She's got a kid.

901
00:58:56.828 --> 00:58:58.038
Never met him.

902
00:58:59.748 --> 00:59:01.583
I wonder if he might
look like me. you know.

903
00:59:02.626 --> 00:59:04.962
If he's lucky.

904
00:59:06.755 --> 00:59:07.923
Nah.

905
00:59:09.591 --> 00:59:11.343
She don't need me in her life.

906
00:59:15.264 --> 00:59:18.767
You're inside there... somewhere.

907
00:59:31.238 --> 00:59:32.906
That's me done.

908
00:59:36.201 --> 00:59:37.202
See you around.

909
00:59:50.966 --> 00:59:52.259
<i>Lucky to have him.</i>

910
00:59:52.509 --> 00:59:55.387
<i>When you look after someone. it gives
you purpose. it gives you meaning.</i>

911
00:59:56.889 --> 00:59:58.473
<i>It makes you a better person.</i>

912
01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:09.503
Hey. Bob.
Guess who I've just been out with?

913
01:01:10.128 --> 01:01:13.257
Mick. Yeah. Of all people.

914
01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:17.010
Nasty Mick. Mick the spy.

915
01:01:17.511 --> 01:01:19.429
Except he's not a spy after all.

916
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.308
Bob. Come on. mate.

917
01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.143
Must be hungry.
Come and get your dinner.

918
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:32.276
Bob? Bob.

919
01:01:35.445 --> 01:01:36.572
Bob.

920
01:01:37.447 --> 01:01:38.740
Mate. are you OK?

921
01:01:39.533 --> 01:01:40.534
Bob.

922
01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.746
Come on.

923
01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.206
Erm.

924
01:01:46.915 --> 01:01:48.917
Come on.
pull yourself together. Think.

925
01:02:08.729 --> 01:02:11.106
<i>This is Dr Becky
at the Green Veterinary Centre.</i>

926
01:02:11.148 --> 01:02:12.608
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

927
01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:15.736
Dr Becky. it's Bea's friend. James.

928
01:02:15.777 --> 01:02:18.739
Erm. it's Bob. my cat. He's sick.

929
01:02:19.364 --> 01:02:20.657
Really sick.

930
01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:22.201
Call me. please.

931
01:02:39.885 --> 01:02:42.471
- Don't let the elephants...
- You gotta help me.

932
01:02:46.016 --> 01:02:48.227
Is he eating? Drinking?

933
01:02:48.268 --> 01:02:49.436
Nothing.

934
01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:53.649
Let's put a bowl of water by his head.

935
01:02:54.024 --> 01:02:55.275
And we should keep him warm.

936
01:03:17.381 --> 01:03:19.633
- Did you write these?
- Some.

937
01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:22.553
My friend Bea's idea.

938
01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:27.224
Hmm.

939
01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:29.434
Should never have let him come out
in this weather.

940
01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:32.229
Wouldn't have animal welfare
on my case.

941
01:03:32.271 --> 01:03:33.564
Animal welfare?

942
01:03:34.189 --> 01:03:35.274
Erm...

943
01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:43.365
They're threatening to take Bob away.

944
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:49.204
Maybe they should.

945
01:04:02.801 --> 01:04:04.595
I don't know how you did it with Mo.

946
01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:09.224
Just sitting there. waiting.

947
01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:14.521
Well. from the outside
it looks very different.

948
01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:18.901
You just deal with it.
It becomes your reality.

949
01:04:22.362 --> 01:04:23.572
How do you go on?

950
01:04:28.911 --> 01:04:33.498
There were three pilgrims
on a journey to a holy place.

951
01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:36.376
Each had suffered great sadness.

952
01:04:36.752 --> 01:04:40.255
Each was looking for peace.
a way ahead.

953
01:04:41.173 --> 01:04:43.175
Each had two sacks.

954
01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:45.886
one on his back. the other
round the neck at his front.

955
01:04:47.846 --> 01:04:51.141
The first man
filled the sack on his back

956
01:04:51.183 --> 01:04:52.684
with all the good things in his life.

957
01:04:52.726 --> 01:04:55.896
Like your tree.
Happy thoughts. memories.

958
01:04:56.271 --> 01:04:57.272
OK.

959
01:04:58.357 --> 01:05:01.235
At the front.
he kept all the bad things.

960
01:05:01.527 --> 01:05:04.238
His sadness. guilt. Bad memories.

961
01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:08.534
Because he. he wanted to think
about them. Make sense of them.

962
01:05:08.867 --> 01:05:10.661
Even though there was none to be made.

963
01:05:11.662 --> 01:05:15.249
Because of this.
he didn't make much progress.

964
01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:16.917
He soon gave up the journey.

965
01:05:16.959 --> 01:05:18.418
I had a feeling he would.

966
01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:21.046
Now. the second man.

967
01:05:21.588 --> 01:05:23.715
He carried
the good things at the front.

968
01:05:23.966 --> 01:05:25.592
He liked to show them off.

969
01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:30.514
He kept the bad things on his back.
even though they weighed heavily.

970
01:05:31.306 --> 01:05:35.269
His journey was slow as well.
He too gave up.

971
01:05:35.602 --> 01:05:37.396
The third one got it right.
I'm betting.

972
01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:38.438
No.

973
01:05:38.897 --> 01:05:41.108
He also carried the good things
at the front.

974
01:05:41.149 --> 01:05:44.570
but to him they were an inspiration.

975
01:05:44.862 --> 01:05:46.738
Like...

976
01:05:47.614 --> 01:05:49.992
sails on a ship. moving him faster.

977
01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:53.161
And he didn't carry anything
on his back?

978
01:05:53.203 --> 01:05:54.913
Yes. he did.

979
01:05:55.664 --> 01:05:57.541
But he cut a hole in that sack.

980
01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:02.212
so all the bad things
slowly dropped onto the road.

981
01:06:02.838 --> 01:06:03.881
Hmm.

982
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:09.428
- And he reached the holy place?
- And found a new way forward.

983
01:06:13.098 --> 01:06:14.600
So which one was you?

984
01:06:21.023 --> 01:06:22.608
I have been all three.

985
01:06:24.234 --> 01:06:28.363
But now I just carry my good memories
of Mo and let them inspire me.

986
01:06:30.157 --> 01:06:31.617
And the bad?

987
01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:37.581
Mm. That took a while.

988
01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:41.627
But now I understand...

989
01:06:43.795 --> 01:06:48.383
the greatest act of love I showed Mo
was in letting him go.

990
01:06:49.134 --> 01:06:50.511
To a better place.

991
01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:55.015
So. the memories...

992
01:06:57.809 --> 01:07:00.938
the beeping of that machine.
the tubes. the wires.

993
01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.815
the signing of those forms.

994
01:07:04.983 --> 01:07:06.735
I was free to let them go too.

995
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.450
You must not let your future
be weighed down by your past.

996
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:15.911
You will get to where you need to go.

997
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:20.123
But what about him?

998
01:07:23.752 --> 01:07:25.963
Maybe he will be
a part of that journey.

999
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:28.382
But if not.

1000
01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:32.636
you have already proved
your love a hundred times over.

1001
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:41.937
I had better go.
It's already Christmas Eve.

1002
01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:47.025
Busy day ahead. Let me know
if there's anything I can do. Hmm?

1003
01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:08.232
Bob.

1004
01:09:08.982 --> 01:09:10.192
Bob.

1005
01:09:11.068 --> 01:09:12.444
Bob.

1006
01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:15.197
Bob!

1007
01:09:17.573 --> 01:09:21.453
He'll be in here... somewhere.

1008
01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:25.957
Always.

1009
01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.711
The greatest act of love

1010
01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:31.796
I showed Mo...

1011
01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:35.425
was in letting him go.

1012
01:09:51.483 --> 01:09:54.444
Now. who's a good boy?

1013
01:09:55.445 --> 01:09:57.865
Good boy. Bob.

1014
01:10:22.055 --> 01:10:23.098
Bob.

1015
01:10:38.864 --> 01:10:42.743
It's a stomach thing. probably.
It's not unusual for cats.

1016
01:10:42.784 --> 01:10:45.621
Has he eaten anything he shouldn't
in the past 48 hours?

1017
01:10:46.663 --> 01:10:48.040
Yeah. Erm...

1018
01:10:48.707 --> 01:10:51.210
Some chicken.
Some old food from the fridge.

1019
01:10:51.543 --> 01:10:53.879
- It had all gone off.
- Did he vomit?

1020
01:10:53.921 --> 01:10:55.339
Yeah. lots.

1021
01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.299
That's good.
That's nature taking its course.

1022
01:10:57.716 --> 01:11:00.552
And the rest will have just
worked its way through his system.

1023
01:11:00.886 --> 01:11:02.804
He'll be all right now.

1024
01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:06.850
He doesn't deserve to live like this.

1025
01:11:06.892 --> 01:11:09.394
Freezing all the time. Getting sick.

1026
01:11:10.354 --> 01:11:13.398
- It's not good enough.
- What are you talking about. James?

1027
01:11:15.776 --> 01:11:18.487
What happens when a cat
gets taken in by animal welfare?

1028
01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:22.991
Do they have those smart cat kennels.
like. they're well looked after?

1029
01:11:23.617 --> 01:11:25.035
I suppose.

1030
01:11:25.077 --> 01:11:26.828
What are you babbling on about?

1031
01:11:27.454 --> 01:11:30.457
You've had a shock. but Bob's fine.

1032
01:11:30.499 --> 01:11:31.708
Yeah. she's right.

1033
01:11:32.584 --> 01:11:36.046
Take time together at Christmas
and Bob will be his old self again.

1034
01:11:37.172 --> 01:11:39.216
You'll soon be back
into the old routine.

1035
01:11:40.259 --> 01:11:43.262
Yeah. well.
that's the problem. isn't it?

1036
01:12:33.687 --> 01:12:37.107
<i>Hi. This is James. Well. James' phone.</i>

1037
01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:39.318
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

1038
01:12:55.667 --> 01:12:57.628
I don't want
to hear any more.

1039
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:59.171
I think the cat should be separated.

1040
01:12:59.213 --> 01:13:02.257
<i>You've reached the voicemail
for Ruth Davies. animal welfare.</i>

1041
01:13:02.299 --> 01:13:04.051
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

1042
01:13:05.177 --> 01:13:06.553
<i>Hi. Ruth. This is James Bowen.</i>

1043
01:13:07.179 --> 01:13:10.766
<i>I've come
to a decision about Bob</i>

1044
01:13:11.183 --> 01:13:13.310
<i>and I need to talk to you.</i>

1045
01:13:31.453 --> 01:13:33.121
Hey.

1046
01:13:33.413 --> 01:13:34.915
Hey. hey.

01:13:34.957 --> 01:13:36.083
<i>What about him?</i>

1048
01:13:37.251 --> 01:13:40.504
<i>You must not let your future
be weighed down by your past.</i>

1049
01:13:45.092 --> 01:13:48.262
<i>You have already proved your love
a hundred times over.</i>

1050
01:13:55.394 --> 01:13:58.397
Come on. then. mate. Good boy. Bob.

1051
01:14:08.991 --> 01:14:10.284
Come on. then. mate.

1052
01:14:32.973 --> 01:14:34.099
That's the guy.

1053
01:15:31.323 --> 01:15:32.783
Platform one.
down the stairs to the right.

1054
01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:34.576
- Great. Thank you.
- No worries.

1055
01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.954
James. I haven't seen you in days.

1056
01:15:36.995 --> 01:15:38.872
I just came to wish you
a happy Christmas.

1057
01:15:38.914 --> 01:15:40.874
Aww. thank you so much.

1058
01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:44.211
Oh. Hold on there. now.
I have some stuff for you too.

1059
01:15:44.586 --> 01:15:46.839
People came by. dropping these off.

1060
01:15:47.548 --> 01:15:49.258
- It's all for us?
- Mm-hm.

1061
01:15:50.008 --> 01:15:52.886
Wow. Thank you.

1062
01:15:53.303 --> 01:15:55.180
- Come on. Bob.
- Happy Christmas.

1063
01:16:05.858 --> 01:16:07.192
James!

1064
01:16:07.985 --> 01:16:09.319
James.

1065
01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:12.197
Where have you two been hiding?

1066
01:16:12.239 --> 01:16:13.991
I've been looking all over.

1067
01:16:14.032 --> 01:16:16.201
- I got you a card.
- Ah.

1068
01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:18.871
How sweet of you.

1069
01:16:19.788 --> 01:16:21.415
Not surprised you've been lying low.

1070
01:16:21.456 --> 01:16:23.625
with all that council nonsense
as well.

1071
01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:25.752
Council nonsense?

1072
01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.964
Here.

1073
01:16:29.798 --> 01:16:31.800
Oh! Thank you.

1074
01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:34.344
- Aren't you going to open it?
- Yeah.

1075
01:16:38.098 --> 01:16:40.601
Oh. Irene. that's too kind.

1076
01:16:40.642 --> 01:16:44.146
Look. Bob. Bob. look. Your own bed.

1077
01:16:44.188 --> 01:16:47.191
I don't know what to say.
I feel awful. This is. erm...

1078
01:16:48.483 --> 01:16:51.153
You really have no idea. do you?

1079
01:16:53.488 --> 01:16:54.990
- See?
- There he is.

1080
01:16:56.658 --> 01:16:58.952
- Merry Christmas. James.
- Thank you.

1081
01:16:58.994 --> 01:17:01.413
- It's all right.
- It's really kind of you.

1082
01:17:01.455 --> 01:17:02.497
Merry Christmas. James.

1083
01:17:02.539 --> 01:17:03.999

1084
01:17:04.041 --> 01:17:05.167
Merry Christmas. James.

1085

Merry Christmas.
Bob and James.

1086
01:17:06.627 --> 01:17:08.295
Merry Christmas. my love.

1087
01:17:08.337 --> 01:17:10.589
- Merry Christmas.
- Where have you all come from?

1088
01:17:10.631 --> 01:17:12.299
Thank you.

1089
01:17:12.341 --> 01:17:14.635
Wow. Thank you.

1090

1091
01:17:17.095 --> 01:17:19.515
- I don't know what to say.
- Happy Christmas. James.

1092
01:17:19.556 --> 01:17:22.476
All right. mate.
Got a little surprise for you.

1093
01:17:22.518 --> 01:17:25.062
This is for Bob.

1094
01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:27.814
And that is panda from China.

1095
01:17:27.856 --> 01:17:29.441
Thank you so much.

1096
01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:32.819
- Look. Bob. Look.
- Doesn't he look lovely?

1097
01:17:32.861 --> 01:17:34.279
What you do think?
You like it?

1098
01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:35.781
- It's very kind of you.
- Right. follow me.

1099
01:17:37.741 --> 01:17:38.992
Thank you.

1100
01:17:39.743 --> 01:17:40.744
James.

1101
01:17:42.037 --> 01:17:43.205
Mick.

1102
01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:49.294
This is my daughter. Maisie.
and this is my grandson. Michael.

1103
01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.422
Wow. Michael. look at you.

1104
01:17:55.384 --> 01:17:58.053
That thing you said to me in the pub.
you know. made me think. and. er...

1105
01:18:00.597 --> 01:18:01.765
Here we are.

1106
01:18:04.977 --> 01:18:06.019
Thanks.

1107
01:18:20.784 --> 01:18:23.036
Over my dead body.

1108
01:18:24.371 --> 01:18:26.498
- Let me handle this.
- Fine.

1109
01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:30.335
If you could all just give me
a moment. just to speak to James.

1110
01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:33.714
Yeah.

1111
01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:37.509
- Can you keep hold of Bob?
- Yes. Yes. of course.

1112
01:18:39.469 --> 01:18:40.679
You'll be all right. Bob.

1113
01:18:42.764 --> 01:18:44.600
You really should
switch your phone on.

1114
01:18:44.641 --> 01:18:46.143
Might have avoided all this.

1115
01:18:46.602 --> 01:18:49.104
It's been a difficult few days.

1116
01:18:49.146 --> 01:18:50.439
For all of us.

1117
01:18:51.231 --> 01:18:55.319
Anyhow. we've been speaking
to people. evaluating your case.

1118
01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.945
So have I. and. erm...

1119
01:18:59.239 --> 01:19:01.533
- I think I've decided that...
- Wait.

1120
01:19:03.285 --> 01:19:04.286
Do you know what these are?

1121
01:19:06.205 --> 01:19:09.416
Letters. notes. cards. emails...

1122
01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:12.878
"I'd just lost my husband of 40 years.

1123
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.838
"The curtains were still drawn
from the funeral.

1124
01:19:15.255 --> 01:19:17.716
"But when James let me
spend a few minutes with Bob.

1125
01:19:17.758 --> 01:19:20.052
"it gave me a reason
to draw back the curtains.

1126
01:19:20.594 --> 01:19:23.388
"You could say they've let the light
back into my life."

1127
01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:28.644
There's an online petition too.
800 signatures in less than 24 hours.

1128
01:19:29.311 --> 01:19:30.687
What? Who...

1129
01:19:30.729 --> 01:19:34.733
Er. under the name MoodyMo12?

1130
01:19:39.112 --> 01:19:42.241
That's. that's all amazing.
but. erm...

1131
01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:45.744
I know you'll look after him.

1132
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:49.623
and. erm. I know it's for the best.

1133
01:19:49.665 --> 01:19:52.417
James. No.

1134
01:19:53.252 --> 01:19:55.003
You don't understand.

1135
01:19:56.463 --> 01:19:58.006
You belong together.

1136
01:19:58.423 --> 01:20:00.551
We're not looking after him. You are.

1137
01:20:03.554 --> 01:20:05.806
I... I don't know what to say.

1138
01:20:05.848 --> 01:20:07.307
There's something else.

1139
01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:10.644
A charity. Inspirational Animals.

1140
01:20:10.978 --> 01:20:13.480
Uh. they work with therapy animals.

1141
01:20:13.522 --> 01:20:15.190
They visit people in hospitals.

1142
01:20:15.232 --> 01:20:18.151
They want you and Bob
to be paid ambassadors.

1143
01:20:19.486 --> 01:20:20.571
What?

1144
01:20:21.321 --> 01:20:23.115
Really?

1145
01:20:23.949 --> 01:20:25.033
What?

1146
01:20:26.743 --> 01:20:28.036
- Really?
- Yeah.

1147
01:20:28.871 --> 01:20:31.790
Might come in handy
when Bob visits the hospitals.

1148
01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:35.252
Thank you.

1149
01:20:35.294 --> 01:20:36.712
Think you're so bloody clever.
don't you?

1150
01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:40.048
Oh. I've got...

1151
01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.218
For all you've done.

1152
01:20:44.928 --> 01:20:47.723
James. Did I miss anything?

1153
01:20:50.058 --> 01:20:51.268
I get to keep him.

1154
01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:53.103

You reap what you sow.

- Except you left out a bit.
- Did I?

1162
01:21:34.102 --> 01:21:36.438
Sometimes you don't even know
you've got seeds to sow.

1163
01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.106
Well. we all have those.

She's only second cousin
to the flipping queen.

Well. quite the fan club.

1172

Mr Bowen. I couldn't let Christmas
pass without repaying your kindness.

1173
01:22:08.637 --> 01:22:12.182
And if there's anything I can ever do
for you and Bob. any time...

1174

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.249
<i>to those who may be struggling
to make ends meet.</i>

1202
01:24:00.499 --> 01:24:02.167
Hm. She's an angel.

1203
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:03.836
<i>So. what do we have for you today?</i>

1204
01:24:03.877 --> 01:24:06.713
<i>After the savoury. always some sweet.</i>

1205
01:24:07.047 --> 01:24:08.757
<i>Now. let's see if these are ready.</i>

1206
01:24:11.343 --> 01:24:14.137
<i>Ah. Perfect. Golden brown.</i>

1207
01:24:15.472 --> 01:24:19.685
<i>Now. these treats would grace
any Christmas table.</i>

1208
01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:22.104
<i>Especially these.</i>

1209
01:24:22.563 --> 01:24:25.691
<i>which I've made in honour
of a very special friend of mine.</i>

1210
01:24:26.233 --> 01:24:30.445
<i>without whom I may never have known
of this quite remarkable place.</i>

1211
01:24:31.572 --> 01:24:34.074
Bob. look. You're on TV.

1212
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:37.035
<i>Happy Christmas. Bob.</i>

1213
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.997
<i>Now. turkey...</i>

1214
01:24:40.038 --> 01:24:41.290
<i>He's been eating all morning.</i>

1215
01:24:41.331 --> 01:24:42.708
<i>He's had a couple
of pigs in blankets. hasn't he?</i>

1216
01:24:42.749 --> 01:24:44.793
He doesn't seem
to be too interested.

1217
01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:46.420
Thank you.

1218
01:24:46.795 --> 01:24:47.838
Mm.

1219
01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.174
Me and Bob were thinking
we might play charades later.

1220
01:24:50.507 --> 01:24:51.717
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

1221
01:24:51.758 --> 01:24:52.759
We should start thinking of some.

1222
01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:54.469
I don't know how I can ever thank you.

1223
01:24:54.511 --> 01:24:56.096
You don't need to thank me.

1224
01:24:56.138 --> 01:24:57.514
I've started work on the new book.

1225
01:24:57.806 --> 01:24:59.558
If I hadn't met you.
I'd never have thought of it.

1226
01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.894
- Thought of what?
- What to write.

1227
01:25:01.935 --> 01:25:05.480
Actually. I've got
a little gift for you.

1228
01:25:05.522 --> 01:25:07.816
Happy Christmas.

1229
01:25:16.283 --> 01:25:19.494
Ah. mate. Ah. this is so cool.

1230
01:25:19.536 --> 01:25:20.746
It's from me and Bob.

1231
01:25:21.955 --> 01:25:23.707
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

1232
01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:37.012
I didn't know what to get you.
and then I remembered your nan's tree

1233
01:25:37.054 --> 01:25:40.015
and the messages about Christmas

1234
01:25:40.057 --> 01:25:42.017
and the feeling it gave you and...

1235
01:25:42.059 --> 01:25:44.978
The Little Book of Bob.

1236
01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:46.522
Oh. it's beautiful.

1237
01:25:46.813 --> 01:25:49.358
Yeah. it is.

1238
01:26:00.661 --> 01:26:01.995
