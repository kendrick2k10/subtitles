<i>Something was troubling her.</i>

4
00:32:37.208 --> 00:32:38.500
<i>She wouldn't tell us what.</i>

5
00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:41.791
{\an8}<i>But she was scared of someone.</i>

6
00:46:31.208 --> 00:46:33.208
Have we got the place ready?

7
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.125
It's ready.

8
00:46:37.666 --> 00:46:39.333
And the last of the livestock?

9
00:46:39.333 --> 00:46:40.916
En route and on schedule.

10
00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:53.500
So we're ready to go?

11
00:46:54.958 --> 00:46:56.166
We're ready.

12
00:46:56.958 --> 00:46:59.166
<i>Here's to the start of my new life.</i>

13
00:47:00.375 --> 00:47:04.791
I wish you could be with me
at the launch party.

14
01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:37.625
Yes?

15
01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:38.791
Arkady!

16
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:42.833
I need you to go ahead
and get things ready.

17
01:04:42.833 --> 01:04:44.833
I'm running a few hours late.

18
01:04:45.416 --> 01:04:47.416
Of course. Is there a problem?

19
01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:49.000
No. No problem.

20
01:04:49.625 --> 01:04:53.708
I just need to stop off
and pick up one extra.

21
01:04:55.708 --> 01:04:57.458
<i>How are we looking otherwise?</i>

22
01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:01.958
The site's up and counting down.

23
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:03.791
They're coming in numbers.

24
01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:06.750
Nice one.

25
01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:10.458
- See you soon then.
<i>- See you soon.</i>

26
01:51:30.166 --> 01:51:31.500
I'd rather burn.
