00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.977
>>Dead of winter.
cold as all hell.

4
00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:52.547
A man hails a cab. he slides in.

5
00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:55.115
sits in the warmth
in the back seat.

6
00:01:56.681 --> 00:02:01.512
A few miles down the road.
cab hits a sheet of black ice.

7
00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:05.168
starts spinning outta control.

8
00:02:05.168 --> 00:02:07.779
heading towards the
edge of the bridge.

9
00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:09.651
nothing but blackness below.

10
00:02:10.782 --> 00:02:14.308
Driver screams.
"We're all gonna die!"

11
00:02:16.658 --> 00:02:19.617
The man calmly leans
forward and softly says.

12
00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:23.926
"Could you turn the radio up?"

13
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.160
>>I don't get it.
which one are you?

14
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.813
The driver or the
guy in the back?

15
00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:44.425
>>Both.

16
00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:46.296
>>Hey. hey!

17
00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:47.515
Uh!

18
00:03:05.837 --> 00:03:08.231
>>We may all be sliding
towards the edge.

19
00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.279
but it's up to you how
comfortable you are doing it.

20
00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:15.891
Pay your debts. friend.

21
00:03:45.616 --> 00:03:46.487
>>Oh. hell.

22
00:05:38.163 --> 00:05:40.252
>>Hey.
>>How's it going?

23
00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:41.558
>>Good. yeah. getting there.

24
00:05:41.558 --> 00:05:43.038
>>Need you back on 32 tomorrow.

25
00:05:43.038 --> 00:05:44.953
once you get this buttoned up.

26
00:05:44.953 --> 00:05:45.997
>>Okay. yeah.

27
00:05:45.997 --> 00:05:47.042
>>Think you can handle

28
00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:48.696
two of Jim's shifts next week?

29
00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:51.742
>>Well. hell yeah.

30
00:05:51.742 --> 00:05:54.919
>>Good. 'cause he'll need
to take the week off.

31
00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:56.007
the kid died.

32
00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:58.053
>>What?

33
00:05:59.837 --> 00:06:01.883
Shit. Caleb?

34
00:06:01.883 --> 00:06:05.974
>>Well. he's gonna take
the week. funeral and all.

35
00:06:06.975 --> 00:06:08.019
>>Yeah. yeah.

36
00:06:10.021 --> 00:06:12.937
Damn. what the hell happened?

37
00:06:12.937 --> 00:06:16.506
>>Overdose. fucking
pills or whatever else.

38
00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:18.378
It's a shame too.
he was a good kid.

39
00:06:19.553 --> 00:06:21.946
he used to be. I don't know.

40
00:06:21.946 --> 00:06:25.602
>>Yeah.

41
00:06:25.602 --> 00:06:26.864
>>I gotta.

42
00:06:26.864 --> 00:06:27.909
>>Thanks. Mike.

43
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:28.866
>>Yep.

44
00:07:23.878 --> 00:07:26.968
>>I still don't get why
it's gotta be so loud.

45
00:07:26.968 --> 00:07:29.753
>>Well. 'cause loud is fast.

46
00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:34.192
>>So how come you
race and Mama doesn't?

47
00:07:34.192 --> 00:07:37.848
>>Well. baby girl.
'cause your Mama's smart.

48
00:07:39.023 --> 00:07:40.895
>>And you're what?

49
00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:42.244
>>Well. I'm tough and strong.

50
00:07:42.244 --> 00:07:44.464
>>And Mama's not strong?

51
00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:45.813
>>Oh. geez. girl.

52
00:07:46.857 --> 00:07:48.990
Look. sometimes it's not about.

53
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.993
you know. how much
you can lift. right.

54
00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:53.951
but about how much
weight you can carry.

55
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:56.998
that makes you strong.
you know what that means?

56
00:07:56.998 --> 00:07:57.825
>>Maybe.

57
00:07:59.609 --> 00:08:02.177
>>You know those. ah.
those big. old trees

58
00:08:02.177 --> 00:08:04.832
we learned about out
there in California.

59
00:08:04.832 --> 00:08:06.877
ones so big you can drive
a car right through them?

60
00:08:06.877 --> 00:08:08.444
>>Yeah.

61
00:08:08.444 --> 00:08:10.577
>>You know how those trees
survived for thousands of years.

62
00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:12.100
right. just standing there

63
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.668
and then one day. a
skinny. little man.

64
00:08:14.668 --> 00:08:16.974
your height. maybe even smaller
than you comes along. right.

65
00:08:16.974 --> 00:08:19.455
with a little ax. a few hours.

66
00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:21.457
he cuts that big. old tree down.

67
00:08:21.457 --> 00:08:23.807
>>She's a skinny man?

68
00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:28.159
>>No. baby girl. the ax.
right. she might be small.

69
00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:30.858
but damn. she can cut
that big old tree down.

70
00:08:30.858 --> 00:08:33.513
She doesn't need to race
to prove she's tough.

71
00:08:33.513 --> 00:08:36.516
She doesn't even need to
cut down a big. old tree.

72
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.908
you know. like the ax. right?

73
00:08:37.908 --> 00:08:40.389
You can just take
one look at her.

74
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:43.958
realize what she's capable
of. that's your Mama.

75
00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.829
>>Daddy says you're an ax.

76
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:47.570
>>Hey.

77
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.224
>>What. like an old battle ax?

78
00:08:49.224 --> 00:08:52.923
>>No. not an ax. I meant like a.

79
00:08:52.923 --> 00:08:55.186
a shiny. you know.
slender blade.

80
00:08:55.186 --> 00:08:57.449
>>Boy. I can cut
you down to size.

81
00:08:57.449 --> 00:08:58.929
>>Yeah. ain't that the truth?

82
00:08:58.929 --> 00:09:00.583
Get me in trouble.

83
00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:02.542
>>Trey's stopping by.

84
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.892
>>Oh great. well. he
can slide under there

85
00:09:04.892 --> 00:09:07.634
and help me swap
that. that rear end.

86
00:09:07.634 --> 00:09:09.244
>>Oh well. good luck.

87
00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:11.638
that boy doesn't know a monkey
wrench from his asshole.

88
00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:12.900
>>Mama!

89
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.162
>>Hey. come on.
help me with dinner.

90
00:09:14.162 --> 00:09:15.511
>>But I'm helping Dad.

91
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:17.861
>>Come on. he can
clean up his own mess.

92
00:09:18.906 --> 00:09:20.995
Let's go.
>>Thanks for nothing.

93
00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:56.030
>>Damn. never miss
home cooked meals.

94
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.684
until I get them.

95
00:09:57.684 --> 00:09:59.816
>>Doesn't beer count as home
cooked if you live at a bar?

96
00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:04.647
>>[laughing] I live above
a bar. cut me some slack.

97
00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:06.997
No. seriously though.
that was delicious.

98
00:10:06.997 --> 00:10:09.870
Not as good as your
mom's. but pretty decent.

99
00:10:10.914 --> 00:10:11.872
Oh. shit. damn.

100
00:10:13.482 --> 00:10:14.701
You knew.

101
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:16.224
>>Well. I didn't know
if you'd come otherwise.

102
00:10:16.224 --> 00:10:17.791
>>Well. I wouldn't have.
>>Oh yeah. I know.

103
00:10:19.967 --> 00:10:21.882
>>Oh. hey there. Uncle Bodie.

104
00:10:21.882 --> 00:10:24.798
>>Hey. Shelby. how's
my favorite driver?

105
00:10:25.886 --> 00:10:26.843
>>Good. good.

106
00:10:26.843 --> 00:10:29.237
>>What do you know. Trey?

107
00:10:30.717 --> 00:10:33.110
>>Just here for the
food. same as you.

108
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.982
>>Oh. I'm guilty.

109
00:10:35.983 --> 00:10:37.637
You take care of that ticket?

110
00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.856
>>It's in the mail. Sheriff.

111
00:10:39.856 --> 00:10:41.466
>>Aren't they all?

112
00:10:42.729 --> 00:10:44.861
>>How you holding up. Sheriff?

113
00:10:44.861 --> 00:10:45.819
>>I'm still standing.

114
00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:48.909
>>Oh-oh!

115
00:10:48.909 --> 00:10:52.869
>>Oh. oh. no. no. no. my
heart. my heart is racing.

116
00:10:52.869 --> 00:10:57.744
Are you the most beautiful
princess in the world?

117
00:10:57.744 --> 00:11:00.311
>>Mr. Bodie. Mama
got you a plate.

118
00:11:01.573 --> 00:11:04.185
>>Plate? I ain't
here for no plate.

119
00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:06.709
I'm here on official
police business.

120
00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:08.624
>>Yeah. I bet. like every week.

121
00:11:08.624 --> 00:11:11.453
>>What? I am.

122
00:11:11.453 --> 00:11:12.933
>>Come on.

123
00:11:12.933 --> 00:11:14.761
>>Ah. you're too good
to me. thank you.

124
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:16.240
>>We missed you
at service Sunday.

125
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.158
>>Yeah. you know. I don't
know about that new preacher.

126
00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:25.554
Call me old fashioned.
but I'm kind of more of a.

127
00:11:25.554 --> 00:11:28.426
I don't know. fire and
brimstone type of guy. you know?

128
00:11:28.426 --> 00:11:30.777
>>Yeah. I hear that.

129
00:11:30.777 --> 00:11:33.518
>>Well. I hate to
grab a plate and run.

130
00:11:33.518 --> 00:11:36.347
but I think y'all don't
really watch me eat.

131
00:11:38.001 --> 00:11:39.394
>>Goodnight. Sheriff.

132
00:11:39.394 --> 00:11:41.831
>>Take care now.
>>You too.

133
00:11:41.831 --> 00:11:44.747
>>All right. little
lady. bedtime.

134
00:11:44.747 --> 00:11:45.748
>>Oh!

135
00:11:45.748 --> 00:11:46.575
>>No. no.

136
00:11:48.969 --> 00:11:50.274
>>Night. Daddy.

137
00:11:50.274 --> 00:11:51.798
>>Sweet dreams.
beauty. I love you.

138
00:11:51.798 --> 00:11:52.842
All right.
>>Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

139
00:11:52.842 --> 00:11:54.801
Whoa. come on!
>>Night. booger.

140
00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:56.411
>>Goodnight. little booger.

141
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:59.631
>>[laughing] Come on.

142
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.902
>>Hey. Earnhardt.

143
00:12:13.907 --> 00:12:14.821
>>Thank you.

144
00:12:16.953 --> 00:12:18.912
>>How long you
gonna do this for?

145
00:12:20.304 --> 00:12:22.437
>>I don't know. as
long as it takes.

146
00:12:24.047 --> 00:12:26.528
Fine anyway. these
are doing the trick.

147
00:12:26.528 --> 00:12:30.532
>>It killed Muhammad Ali.
this shit ain't no joke.

148
00:12:30.532 --> 00:12:32.447
>>And you think I
don't know that. Trey?

149
00:12:32.447 --> 00:12:34.623
What the hell you
want me to do. man?

150
00:12:35.885 --> 00:12:37.887
Let me just get our
heads above water.

151
00:12:37.887 --> 00:12:39.802
then we can deal
with me. all right?

152
00:12:39.802 --> 00:12:42.849
>>You can't get shit by her.
you know that. you never could.

153
00:12:44.546 --> 00:12:46.853
>>Think I like keeping
secrets from her. Trey?

154
00:12:46.853 --> 00:12:49.725
Just give me some
fucking room. huh?

155
00:12:49.725 --> 00:12:50.813
>>Your funeral.

156
00:12:54.295 --> 00:12:55.992
>>Come grab this side.

157
00:12:55.992 --> 00:12:59.126
>>Now? We just. we just ate.

158
00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:00.475
>>Now. fucker. let's go!

159
00:13:00.475 --> 00:13:02.346
>>All right. all

Oh. man.

177
00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.132
If I wake up in Mexico
with no pants on.

178
00:14:32.132 --> 00:14:33.785
Caroline's gonna
cut your nuts off.

179
00:14:33.785 --> 00:14:36.179
>>[laughing] Your pants
will stay on. I promise.

180
00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:37.180
>>They'd better.

181
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.921
>>Unless you're feeling frisky.

182
00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:41.750
>>Hey. buy me an Oreo
shake and we'll talk.

183
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.620
>>Done.

184
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.065
>>Fucking seat belts
and everything. man.

185
00:14:52.065 --> 00:14:53.805
I can't believe
I'm in this thing.

186
00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:54.719
>>Fuck off.

187
00:14:54.719 --> 00:14:56.939
>>Been here. what. 20 years.

188
00:14:56.939 --> 00:14:59.376
still driving this
piece of shit?

189
00:14:59.376 --> 00:15:03.337
>>Tokyo Green. Hulk
here is unbeatable.

190
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.949
>>Oh my God. Trey.
fucking embarrassing. man.

191
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:10.518
I can't be seen in this
piece of shit. Christ.

192
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.564
>>Whoo. listen to that purr.

193
00:15:13.564 --> 00:15:16.350
That's what I'm talking
about right there. bro.

194
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.613
Whoo!

195
00:15:18.613 --> 00:15:20.658
>>Don't kill us Trey. Jesus.

196
00:15:23.618 --> 00:15:25.359
>>What. man. what is this?

197
00:15:27.013 --> 00:15:28.797
>>That.

198
00:15:28.797 --> 00:15:30.930
>>What you working
on your black belt?

199
00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:34.585
>>Nope.

200
00:15:34.585 --> 00:15:35.935
>>Okay. so what is it?

201
00:15:38.502 --> 00:15:39.460
>>100 K.

202
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.680
cash at least.

203
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:44.944
>>What is?

204
00:15:46.771 --> 00:15:48.860
>>What do you know about Oxy?

205
00:15:50.558 --> 00:15:53.909
>>I don't know shit about
Oxy. Trey. nothing. man.

206
00:15:53.909 --> 00:15:55.867
don't need to.
get me outta here.

207
00:15:55.867 --> 00:15:59.959
>>There's a doc in there.
some bullshit hack.

208
00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:02.700
People come in. "This
hurts and that hurts."

209
00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.007
and Doc will write
out a script for them.

210
00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:07.357
hundreds of them every day.

211
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.665
>>Okay. what the hell's
that got to do with me?

212
00:16:10.665 --> 00:16:13.885
>>And now these yokels. they
go and fulfill those scripts

213
00:16:13.885 --> 00:16:14.799
and guess what?

214
00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:16.497
They come right back here.

215
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.501
Those pills go in and
out that back door

216
00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:22.938
and sold all over the county.

217
00:16:22.938 --> 00:16:25.549
>>[sighing] Man. I don't fucking
care. right. take me home.

218
00:16:25.549 --> 00:16:27.464
>>And once they
sell those pills.

219
00:16:27.464 --> 00:16:29.814
they bring that cash
right back here.

220
00:16:29.814 --> 00:16:31.686
hundreds and
thousands of dollars

221
00:16:31.686 --> 00:16:34.602
running through this piece
of shit right here every week

222
00:16:34.602 --> 00:16:37.909
and nothing but a couple of
backwood inbreds running it.

223
00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:43.002
>>Trey. are you
fucking kidding me?

224
00:16:45.482 --> 00:16:46.701
>>Nope.

225
00:16:46.701 --> 00:16:48.224
>>Are you suggesting
that we stroll in there

226
00:16:48.224 --> 00:16:49.530
and we take that money?

227
00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.532
>>[sighing] We can. we can.

228
00:16:53.969 --> 00:16:58.539
>>Man. that's a stupid
fucking idea.

229
00:16:58.539 --> 00:17:00.976
>>Never ever seen more
than one or two tweakers

230
00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:03.544
in there guarding that place.

231
00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:05.372
It ain't rocket science.

232
00:17:05.372 --> 00:17:07.417
>>Well. that's for damn sure.

233
00:17:09.724 --> 00:17:13.075
>>Shel. they're killing
people with this shit.

234
00:17:14.076 --> 00:17:15.164
you've seen it.

235
00:17:15.164 --> 00:17:16.426
>>I know.

236
00:17:16.426 --> 00:17:18.776
>>We all have.
this town is dying

237
00:17:18.776 --> 00:17:22.171
and these fuckers are
getting rich from it.

238
00:17:22.171 --> 00:17:25.783
That's your cash in
there. that's our cash.

239
00:17:25.783 --> 00:17:28.873
we put our blood. sweat
and tears into this town

240
00:17:28.873 --> 00:17:31.180
and they're just
taking it all from us.

241
00:17:33.269 --> 00:17:36.185
This whole place is
becoming a fucking cliche.

242
00:17:37.621 --> 00:17:39.710
First the factories fold.

243
00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:43.105
then no jobs. no hope

244
00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:45.368
and then these
leeches. they come in.

245
00:17:45.368 --> 00:17:47.240
they suck what's
left off the bottom.

246
00:17:49.938 --> 00:17:54.943
I'm sick of it. Shel.
I'm sick of it.

247
00:17:56.249 --> 00:17:58.903
And I don't wanna see Mila
left in the mud either.

248
00:18:33.851 --> 00:18:36.463
Hey. this is easy money. Shel.

249
00:18:36.463 --> 00:18:39.727
>>Don't talk to me about
this shit again. you hear?

250
00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:46.837
Don't tell me someone else died.

251
00:19:46.837 --> 00:19:48.709
I can't handle that
shit right now.

252
00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:51.059
>>Hop in. catch some of this AC.

253
00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:01.330
>>What's going on?

254
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.419
>>Jim needs those shifts back.

255
00:20:05.813 --> 00:20:07.902
>>Damn. okay.

256
00:20:07.902 --> 00:20:09.904
>>I'll pay for the funeral.

257
00:20:11.297 --> 00:20:12.733
>>Yeah. I get it.

258
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:16.693
>>Oh. shit. that ain't all. man.

259
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.264
>>Shit. Mike.

260
00:20:25.093 --> 00:20:27.878
>>Well. hey there. Shelby.

261
00:20:28.749 --> 00:20:31.012
How we doing today. sugar?

262
00:20:31.012 --> 00:20:33.884
>>I'm hanging in. Ms.
Whitney. what about yourself?

263
00:20:33.884 --> 00:20:36.278
>>Well. I'm still
upright. praise Jesus.

264
00:20:36.278 --> 00:20:39.020
>>Yes. ma'am. I hear that.

265
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.806
>>[sighing] Early
this month. huh?

266
00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:44.982
>>Yeah.

267
00:20:46.723 --> 00:20:48.812
>>Oh. damn it. I'm so sorry.

268
00:20:48.812 --> 00:20:51.337
>>I appreciate
that. Ms. Whitney.

269
00:20:51.337 --> 00:20:52.773
You know what?
>>Hm?

270
00:20:54.862 --> 00:20:56.994
>>Might as well have that too.

271
00:20:56.994 --> 00:20:58.039
>>All righty.

272
00:20:58.039 --> 00:21:00.346
You want your balance receipt?

273
00:21:01.564 --> 00:21:04.219
>>Oh. hell. couldn't
pay for the ink anyway.

274
00:21:04.219 --> 00:21:05.176
>>Love to the girls.

275
00:21:05.176 --> 00:21:07.483
>>Appreciate that. Ms. Whitney.

276
00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:08.397
Take care.
>>Bye.

277
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.257
>>I don't know. man.

278
00:21:42.257 --> 00:21:44.041
guns and drugs.

279
00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:46.130
that shit ain't me.

280
00:21:47.828 --> 00:21:49.046
>>No. it ain't.

281
00:21:51.135 --> 00:21:53.703
That's why you leave
that shit to me.

282
00:21:53.703 --> 00:21:56.402
You just drive the
car and watch my back.

283
00:21:56.402 --> 00:21:59.970
you don't even need to
touch a gun. I promise.

284
00:22:01.581 --> 00:22:02.930
Look. I know these dudes.

285
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.410
we're not talking
"Goodfellas" here.

286
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:07.369
we're talking a couple slack
jaws with pill problems.

287
00:22:19.338 --> 00:22:21.731
>>Girls are going to
Tupelo this weekend.

288
00:22:24.952 --> 00:22:26.257
>>Looky there.

289
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.892
>>Wish you were coming.

290
00:23:35.892 --> 00:23:39.069
>>Shit. no. you don't.

291
00:23:39.069 --> 00:23:41.811
You love that big. old
guest bed all to yourself.

292
00:23:43.204 --> 00:23:45.162
Stay up late watching those
God awful dating shows.

293
00:23:46.468 --> 00:23:48.035
>>You gonna be good here?

294
00:23:49.471 --> 00:23:51.168
>>Of course.

295
00:23:51.168 --> 00:23:54.694
>>Well. good. 'cause I do
love that bed.

296
00:23:54.694 --> 00:23:57.000
Hey. you know what. why don't
you take a couple hundred

297
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.785
and get that old
bluff from Kenny?

298
00:23:58.785 --> 00:24:00.743
You know. keep going
a few more weekends.

299
00:24:00.743 --> 00:24:03.006
I mean. you said Mike
gave you those shifts.

300
00:24:05.008 --> 00:24:06.140
>>Oh baby. I told you.

301
00:24:07.402 --> 00:24:10.449
I can't fix it with what
we got. stays broke.

302
00:24:11.928 --> 00:24:14.191
>>Damn. I love you.

303
00:24:14.191 --> 00:24:16.672
>>What are y'all talking about?

304
00:24:16.672 --> 00:24:18.021
>>Little girls not
finishing packing

305
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:19.893
and getting left behind.
>>You have three minutes

306
00:24:19.893 --> 00:24:21.677
or this train's leaving
with or without you.

307
00:24:21.677 --> 00:24:23.505
>>I just need someone to
sit on it while I zip.

308
00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:25.159
>>Okay. I'll be up
in a few minutes.

309
00:24:25.159 --> 00:24:26.639
>>Well. I'm leaving in three.

310
00:24:26.639 --> 00:24:29.642
>>Oh. boy. she is
definitely your daughter.

311
00:24:33.994 --> 00:24:34.777
>>Open it.

312
00:24:34.777 --> 00:24:35.952
>>What the hell's this?

313
00:24:35.952 --> 00:24:36.779
>>Open it.

314
00:24:49.183 --> 00:24:50.706
>>Damn.

315
00:24:50.706 --> 00:24:52.229
you are too much.

316
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:56.973
>>Mom.

317
00:24:58.235 --> 00:24:59.802
>>Daughter's calling you.

318
00:24:59.802 --> 00:25:02.892
>>Hm. hm-hm. she's
definitely yours.

319
00:25:27.917 --> 00:25:29.571
>>Yeah. this will do.

320
00:25:30.703 --> 00:25:32.095
Where'd you find it?

321
00:25:33.096 --> 00:25:34.837
>>Don't you worry about that.

322
00:25:35.925 --> 00:25:37.753
>>Jesus Christ. Trey.

323
00:25:37.753 --> 00:25:39.276
>>Color's ugly as shit.

324
00:25:39.276 --> 00:25:42.062
but it's a turbo just
like you asked for.

325
00:25:42.062 --> 00:25:44.891
>>Yeah. what about the plates?

326
00:25:44.891 --> 00:25:46.109
>>I took care of it.

327
00:25:50.592 --> 00:25:52.594
>>I do love a turbo V6.

328
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.382
>>Look at Shelby Conners all
excited about a stolen vehicle.

329
00:25:58.382 --> 00:26:00.863
You little criminal.
>>Hey!

330
00:26:00.863 --> 00:26:03.344
This isn't New York. all right.

331
00:26:03.344 --> 00:26:05.868
this is my own backyard. man.

332
00:26:05.868 --> 00:26:08.871
Act like you understand
we're breaking the law.

333
00:26:08.871 --> 00:26:11.091
Act like you understand
what's at stake here.

334
00:26:13.615 --> 00:26:18.141
>>Hey. she's my niece. I fucking
understand what's at stake.

335
00:26:21.014 --> 00:26:23.190
I'm not the one we
gotta worry about.

336
00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:29.326
>>Let's just get this over with.

337
00:26:40.337 --> 00:26:41.643
>>Mr. Bodie.

338
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:45.691
>>That ain't good.

339
00:26:46.953 --> 00:26:49.216
>>I'll get with the
oncologist in Birmingham.

340
00:26:49.216 --> 00:26:53.481
but in the meantime. you
go home. enjoy your day.

341
00:26:53.481 --> 00:26:55.222
We'll take this
one step at a time.

342
00:26:58.225 --> 00:26:59.400
>>Man.

343
00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:56.718
♪ Oh oh

344
00:27:57.284 --> 00:27:59.199
♪ Oh oh oh oh

345
00:28:00.766 --> 00:28:04.465
>>When we get in there. you
just watch my back. that's it.

346
00:28:04.465 --> 00:28:06.859
Okay. we'll be fine as
long as you watch my back.

347
00:28:06.859 --> 00:28:08.512
Here.

348
00:28:08.512 --> 00:28:09.426
>>What the fuck is this. Trey?

349
00:28:09.426 --> 00:28:10.471
You said I wouldn't need this.

350
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:11.385
>>Just hold the fucking thing

351
00:28:11.385 --> 00:28:12.516
and look like you might use it.

352
00:28:12.516 --> 00:28:13.996
What the fuck. all right?

353
00:28:13.996 --> 00:28:15.694
You won't even need
to lift it. trust me.

354
00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:17.130
>>Fuck. fuck. fuck. man. fuck!

355
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.175
>>Hey. hey. hey. hey.
we got this. okay?

356
00:28:19.175 --> 00:28:21.308
We got this.

357
00:28:23.136 --> 00:28:25.051
>>Jesus Christ.
Trey. fuck's sake.

358
00:28:25.051 --> 00:28:28.010
>>What. does it clash
with your outfit? Come on.

359
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:30.360
>>I don't know.
man. I don't know.

360
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.885
>>Hey. just do what family does.

361
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.454
We're family. bro. we
look out for each other.

362
00:28:37.454 --> 00:28:38.542
>>Okay.

363
00:28:38.542 --> 00:28:40.109
>>All right?
>>Okay.

364
00:28:40.109 --> 00:28:40.893
Fuck.

365
00:28:40.893 --> 00:28:42.024
>>Right. come on.

366
00:28:43.025 --> 00:28:45.114
>>Fuck.

367
00:28:46.942 --> 00:28:48.814
>>Hey. take this.

368
00:28:48.814 --> 00:28:50.729
Come on. let's go.

369
00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:52.818
Come on. get out of the
fucking car. let's go.

370
00:29:32.596 --> 00:29:33.380
>>Ssh!

371
00:29:39.995 --> 00:29:41.475
>>Hey!

372
00:29:41.475 --> 00:29:42.824
Shit. Trey. what the fuck?

373
00:29:48.264 --> 00:29:50.353
>>Over there.

374
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:02.844
>>That might've
been an accident.

375
00:30:02.844 --> 00:30:05.064
but the next one
won't be. you hear me?

376
00:30:05.064 --> 00:30:06.979
This guy moves.
take his head off.

377
00:30:08.197 --> 00:30:09.416
Come on.

378
00:30:15.683 --> 00:30:17.380
>>Y'all know whose
money this is.

379
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.861
you have any fucking
idea whose money this is?

380
00:30:19.861 --> 00:30:21.297
>>Shut the fuck up. shut up!

381
00:30:24.039 --> 00:30:25.084
>>Are you okay?

382
00:30:29.175 --> 00:30:32.004
>>Don't look at me.
don't fucking look at me.

383
00:30:33.309 --> 00:30:36.008
>>Ah. shit. tough guy.
y'all don't wanna do this.

384
00:30:36.008 --> 00:30:37.748
you don't wanna do it.

385
00:30:37.748 --> 00:30:40.142
>>Hurry the fuck up. come on.

386
00:30:40.142 --> 00:30:44.451
>>Hey. hey. are you
a Bronson fan. huh?

387
00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:45.844
>>Come on. hurry up. let's go.

388
00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:47.367
>>What's your favorite
"Death Wish" movie.

389
00:30:47.367 --> 00:30:48.890
"One. two. three?"

390
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.936
My friend on the floor
was a Bronson fan.

391
00:30:50.936 --> 00:30:52.459
why don't you ask him. huh?

392
00:30:52.459 --> 00:30:53.721
>>Shut the fuck up. okay.
>>You wanna know

393
00:30:53.721 --> 00:30:54.896
what my favorite is?
>>Turn around!

394
00:30:54.896 --> 00:30:56.550
>>The one where I
hunt you all down.

395
00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.379
snatch the life out of you.
cut the heads off all your kin

396
00:30:59.379 --> 00:31:01.555
and shoot your fucking dog!

397
00:31:02.948 --> 00:31:04.906
It ain't your all's world. huh.

398
00:31:04.906 --> 00:31:05.951
but you're gonna
fucking die in it.

399
00:31:05.951 --> 00:31:07.300
>>Shut the fuck up.

400
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.910
>>Come on!

401
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:11.739
>>Your voice sounds familiar.

402
00:31:11.739 --> 00:31:13.959
Yeah. yeah. look at me. huh?

403
00:31:13.959 --> 00:31:16.962
Yeah. I know you.
yeah. I seen you. boy.

404
00:31:16.962 --> 00:31:18.398
You all are gonna fucking die.

405
00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:19.834
>>Come on. let's go. let's go!

406
00:31:19.834 --> 00:31:21.880
>>You should listen
to your partner here.

407
00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.750
>>No!

408
00:31:23.794 --> 00:31:24.883
>>Oh. shit!

409
00:31:24.883 --> 00:31:26.797
>>Let's go. let's go!

410
00:31:33.326 --> 00:31:36.938
>>Oh. shit. shit. shit.

411
00:31:38.722 --> 00:31:43.771
Fuck!

412
00:31:44.598 --> 00:31:45.686
You fucking shot that guy.

413
00:31:45.686 --> 00:31:47.383
what the fuck is wrong with you?

414
00:31:47.383 --> 00:31:49.777
Huh? Shit!

415
00:31:49.777 --> 00:31:51.170
Who is it. Trey?

416
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:53.999
Shit. ah!

417
00:31:55.304 --> 00:31:57.872
>>Just some heavies. man!

418
00:32:14.062 --> 00:32:17.109
>>Sheriff Bodie. you read me?

419
00:32:18.458 --> 00:32:19.676
>>Go ahead. Beth.

420
00:32:19.676 --> 00:32:22.810
>>Reports of shots
fired. 1911 Bass Lane.

421
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:23.985
>>Oh. shit.

422
00:32:34.039 --> 00:32:36.171
>>They're getting
fucking close. Trey!

423
00:32:37.433 --> 00:32:40.306
>>Wait a minute. stop!

424
00:32:40.306 --> 00:32:42.917
>>What the fuck you doing?

425
00:32:42.917 --> 00:32:45.528
Trey. get back in
the fucking car!

426
00:32:45.528 --> 00:32:47.400
They're shooting at us. shit!

427
00:32:51.839 --> 00:32:53.362
Shit. shit. shit. fuck!

428
00:32:53.362 --> 00:32:55.016
Fuck!

429
00:34:21.276 --> 00:34:22.147
>>Hands up!

430
00:34:24.497 --> 00:34:25.976
Up. come on!

431
00:34:25.976 --> 00:34:27.935
Get your hands up!

432
00:34:30.459 --> 00:34:32.679
Come on now. get them up.

433
00:34:59.836 --> 00:35:00.576
>>Yes!

434
00:35:01.708 --> 00:35:04.319
Look at this.

435
00:35:04.319 --> 00:35:05.929
We did it!

436
00:35:07.148 --> 00:35:08.584
Uh!

437
00:35:09.672 --> 00:35:11.848
>>Fucker!
>>Stop. stop. no. no!

438
00:35:12.849 --> 00:35:14.982
>>What the fuck was that?

439
00:35:15.896 --> 00:35:17.550
>>We got the money.

440
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:21.119
>>The fucking money? We
killed two people. Trey!

441
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.859
You shot him!

442
00:35:22.859 --> 00:35:25.253
What was that shit. huh?

443
00:35:25.253 --> 00:35:29.388
>>Those weren't people.
those were drug dealers.

444
00:35:29.388 --> 00:35:32.217
scum. pill pushers. fuck them.

445
00:35:34.871 --> 00:35:37.004
>>Man. who the fuck are you?

446
00:35:37.004 --> 00:35:38.005
>>We got the cash.

447
00:35:38.005 --> 00:35:39.659
>>Fuck the cash!

448
00:35:39.659 --> 00:35:42.009
What was that shit
with the pills?

449
00:35:42.009 --> 00:35:43.184
Huh?

450
00:35:43.184 --> 00:35:46.361
We didn't go there for that!

451
00:35:46.361 --> 00:35:48.537
You fucking motherfucker.

452
00:35:49.712 --> 00:35:51.714
I didn't fucking sign
up for this shit.

453
00:35:51.714 --> 00:35:55.457
>>Yes. you did. yes. you did!

454
00:35:55.457 --> 00:35:58.243
Yeah. we got the money.
God knows how much

455
00:35:58.243 --> 00:36:00.506
and yeah. we got a
shit load of pills too.

456
00:36:01.855 --> 00:36:04.205
I'm sorry. you thought you
were gonna be halfway in.

457
00:36:09.515 --> 00:36:12.648
>>He said he knew you. Trey.

458
00:36:12.648 --> 00:36:14.911
Did he. do you know those guys?

459
00:36:16.304 --> 00:36:18.045
>>It doesn't matter now.

460
00:36:22.658 --> 00:36:25.922
We just need to to lay
low for a little bit.

461
00:36:25.922 --> 00:36:29.012
keep our heads down. all right.

462
00:36:29.012 --> 00:36:30.449
>>Oh. you're taking it?

463
00:36:32.799 --> 00:36:37.673
>>You want it? Here. take
it. go on. it's yours.

464
00:36:37.673 --> 00:36:39.197
It's called trust. bro.

465
00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:43.897
Just keep it safe. hide it
your toolbox or something.

466
00:36:43.897 --> 00:36:45.725
keep it away from the girls.

467
00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:00.957
>>We fucking killed them. Trey.

468
00:37:03.046 --> 00:37:05.048
>>Yeah. we did. we killed them.

469
00:37:07.094 --> 00:37:09.792
The way I see it.
it was us or them

470
00:37:09.792 --> 00:37:12.360
and I'd fucking do
it again if I had to.

471
00:37:16.364 --> 00:37:19.715
We're family. bro.
that shit back there.

472
00:37:19.715 --> 00:37:21.848
that was nothing but
taking care of family.

473
00:37:25.895 --> 00:37:27.288
Come on.

474
00:37:27.288 --> 00:37:29.029
Come here. come here.

475
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:40.997
Let's go home.

476
00:38:03.933 --> 00:38:07.937
>>We got a 9-0-4 on
Old Fence Road off 58.

477
00:38:07.937 --> 00:38:10.200
We got two dead in the BOLO.

478
00:38:11.419 --> 00:38:13.856
red Buick Regal and I
do not have the tags.

479
00:38:13.856 --> 00:38:17.991
>>10-4. Bodie. Dispatch
will find the new location.

480
00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:19.819
>>Let it burn.

481
00:38:48.021 --> 00:38:49.805
>>Hey. baby. what you doing?

482
00:38:49.805 --> 00:38:51.372
>>Going to bed?

483
00:38:51.372 --> 00:38:54.941
>>Yeah. well. I miss
you. you look beautiful.

484
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:55.724
>>I know.

485
00:38:57.335 --> 00:38:59.946
>>All righty. you. get
in there. I'll be inside.

486
00:38:59.946 --> 00:39:01.513
>>Sweet dreams.

487
00:39:01.513 --> 00:39:02.775
>>Come on.
>>Love you.

488
00:39:02.775 --> 00:39:03.558
>>Night.

489
00:39:05.473 --> 00:39:06.996
>>What are you up to?

490
00:39:06.996 --> 00:39:08.389
>>Just out here in my office.

491
00:39:08.389 --> 00:39:09.956
>>Are you sleeping?

492
00:39:11.436 --> 00:39:12.959
>>Not without you.

493
00:39:12.959 --> 00:39:15.570
>>Baby. you already have me.

494
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.920
no need to keep up
with that sweet talk.

495
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.706
>>No. I know you like it though.

496
00:39:20.706 --> 00:39:22.055
>>I do.

497
00:39:23.665 --> 00:39:24.884
>>How you doing?

498
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:27.974
>>Today was a good day.

499
00:39:27.974 --> 00:39:29.932
It's good to be out here.

500
00:39:31.064 --> 00:39:32.631
I wish you were here though.

501
00:39:50.997 --> 00:39:52.390
>>Just you?

502
00:39:53.869 --> 00:39:56.916
>>Just me. you doing
all right there?

503
00:39:56.916 --> 00:40:00.485
>>Oh. hell yeah. been a
while since I had a dust up.

504
00:40:00.485 --> 00:40:01.834
but I'm fine.

505
00:40:03.183 --> 00:40:06.447
>>In there ain't. county's
sending the coroner down

506
00:40:06.447 --> 00:40:07.970
for what's left.

507
00:40:09.972 --> 00:40:11.887
>>Ben. what are those?

508
00:40:11.887 --> 00:40:12.801
>>Oh. [chuckling].

509
00:40:14.977 --> 00:40:17.545
I'd just gotten my boots
off when I got the call.

510
00:40:17.545 --> 00:40:21.897
>>Man. we're like the
Goddamn Boy Scouts out here.

511
00:40:23.159 --> 00:40:26.946
All right. let's.
let's go in. cameras?

512
00:40:26.946 --> 00:40:28.991
>>Sure. but the
drives were taken.

513
00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:31.994
Car wash has one though.

514
00:40:31.994 --> 00:40:33.431
>>Well. let's get them.

515
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:35.563
>>I already got
them on my laptop.

516
00:40:35.563 --> 00:40:37.347
>>I bet you do.

517
00:40:37.347 --> 00:40:39.132
>>[laughing] Two men in and out.

518
00:40:39.132 --> 00:40:40.960
off in a hurry.

519
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:48.489
>>Oh.

520
00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:49.925
Well. let's see.

521
00:40:52.972 --> 00:40:53.755
Hell.

522
00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:15.995
>>What you thinking?

523
00:41:15.995 --> 00:41:19.302
>>[sighing] I'm thinking
that he's a poor bastard.

524
00:41:19.302 --> 00:41:23.568
that's what I'm thinking.
now were there any witnesses?

525
00:41:23.568 --> 00:41:26.005
>>Sure. Ms. Whitney.

526
00:41:27.136 --> 00:41:28.355
>>What?

527
00:41:28.355 --> 00:41:31.227
>>Yep. she moonlit
over here and the doc.

528
00:41:31.227 --> 00:41:33.752
but he ain't talking yet.

529
00:41:33.752 --> 00:41:36.406
>>All right. well. well.

530
00:41:36.406 --> 00:41:38.931
we just wait for Ms.
Whitney's story. I guess.

531
00:41:40.367 --> 00:41:43.544
But I tell you what
it's gonna be about.

532
00:41:43.544 --> 00:41:47.766
it's gonna be about pills
and money and cussing.

533
00:41:49.115 --> 00:41:51.987
>>Two men. shotgun and a pistol.

534
00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.428
>>Yeah. well. the
pistol did that

535
00:41:58.428 --> 00:42:01.475
and the wood furniture
done that guy in.

536
00:42:02.563 --> 00:42:03.825
>>And he ain't here.

537
00:42:05.131 --> 00:42:06.393
>>No. he isn't.

538
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:09.483
Whiskey in them cups.

539
00:42:14.967 --> 00:42:17.230
And that arm is
junkies robbing junkies

540
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.275
just like the two
guys from the highway.

541
00:42:20.755 --> 00:42:23.802
Man. this is as
crooked as the Chattahoochee.

542
00:42:29.024 --> 00:42:31.287
Well. all right.

543
00:42:31.287 --> 00:42:34.552
call me if anything turns up.

544
00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:35.988
Oh.

545
00:42:35.988 --> 00:42:37.598
>>That's it?

546
00:42:37.598 --> 00:42:40.993
>>That's it. we gotta wait
for. for Ms. Whitney's story

547
00:42:41.907 --> 00:42:44.344
and state's gonna wanna
be in on this one.

548
00:42:44.344 --> 00:42:46.912
>>Sure you don't wanna
look at that tape?

549
00:42:52.482 --> 00:42:53.875
>>Come on. let's go look at it.

550
00:43:02.797 --> 00:43:06.105
>>Wheel man can
drive. that's a fact.

551
00:43:07.672 --> 00:43:08.455
>>Mm-hm.

552
00:43:10.413 --> 00:43:13.678
All right. well.
I'm going to sleep.

553
00:43:13.678 --> 00:43:16.332
Call me if you need
me. otherwise. don't.

554
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.859
>>You sure you're all right?

555
00:43:22.295 --> 00:43:25.777
>>Ben. find your Goddamn boots.

556
00:43:50.236 --> 00:43:53.108
>>God's servant for your good.

557
00:43:59.419 --> 00:44:04.467

I always told my mom

570
00:44:41.983 --> 00:44:44.986

00:49:50.074 --> 00:49:52.990
>>You see the statement from
the doc and Ms. Whitney?

607
00:49:56.384 --> 00:49:57.820
>>Is that it on your seat?

608
00:49:58.908 --> 00:50:00.345
Then how did I see it?

609
00:50:01.955 --> 00:50:05.176
>>Well. the doc wants immunity.

610
00:50:05.176 --> 00:50:07.439
>>Is that right?
>>Yeah.

611
00:50:07.439 --> 00:50:10.746
He says this thing they got
into goes all the way down

612
00:50:10.746 --> 00:50:13.053
to a New Orleans
outfit. down that way.

613
00:50:14.924 --> 00:50:18.493
Pills. clinics. girls. money.

614
00:50:18.493 --> 00:50:21.105
he's saying it's a
damn empire. Bodie.

615
00:50:21.105 --> 00:50:24.847
You know what they're
saying? This outfit is mob.

616
00:50:24.847 --> 00:50:27.894
>>Will you stop it
acting like a preteen

617
00:50:27.894 --> 00:50:30.505
at a Beatles concert.
for God's sake?

618
00:50:30.505 --> 00:50:32.855
What does the state
say. they want in?

619
00:50:32.855 --> 00:50:33.856
>>Nope.
>>They don't want in?

620
00:50:33.856 --> 00:50:34.857
>>Nope.

621
00:50:34.857 --> 00:50:35.989
>>Why not?

622
00:50:35.989 --> 00:50:38.078
>>State line thing.
they're saying DEA.

623
00:50:38.078 --> 00:50:40.124
can you believe that. DEA here?

624
00:50:40.124 --> 00:50:42.213
>>What Ms. Whitney say?

625
00:50:42.213 --> 00:50:44.824
>>Not much. don't
ask. don't tell.

626
00:50:44.824 --> 00:50:46.434
Paid her cash though.

627
00:50:47.435 --> 00:50:48.175
>>Hm.

628
00:50:50.482 --> 00:50:53.441
Lordy. it's just Sunday. damn.

629
00:50:53.441 --> 00:50:55.095
>>That ain't all.

630
00:50:55.095 --> 00:50:57.054
>>You found the shotgun vic?

631
00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:59.534
>>Yeah. well. a
neighbor found him.

632
00:50:59.534 --> 00:51:00.753
>>You got him?

633
00:51:00.753 --> 00:51:02.102
>>He's dead.

634
00:51:02.102 --> 00:51:03.930
>>Well. how. did he bleed out?

635
00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:05.540
>>Oh yeah.
>>Pills?

636
00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:09.892
>>Pills and blood. for sure.
but that ain't what did him in.

637
00:51:09.892 --> 00:51:11.981
a lamp cord around
his neck killed him.

638
00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:14.027
>>Hm.

639
00:51:14.027 --> 00:51:15.507
Shit.

640
00:51:15.507 --> 00:51:19.989
>>Shit? Someone's
cleaning up. Bodie. mob.

641
00:51:23.906 --> 00:51:27.214
>>Well. at least you got
the right shoes on today.

642
00:51:30.174 --> 00:51:32.393
>>Hey. Bodie. do
you think the DEA

643
00:51:32.393 --> 00:51:34.700
will give me one
of those jackets?

644
00:51:36.093 --> 00:51:38.399
>>Well. slap you to sleep
and slap you for sleeping.

645
00:51:38.399 --> 00:51:40.271
Now get outta here.

646
00:52:10.823 --> 00:52:12.303
>>Morning. Shelby.

647
00:52:15.262 --> 00:52:16.089
Get up.

648
00:52:21.921 --> 00:52:24.358
>>Hey. listen. I won't talk.

649
00:52:24.358 --> 00:52:26.969
Uh!

650
00:52:30.103 --> 00:52:31.191
>>Get down.

651
00:52:32.714 --> 00:52:34.194
Give me your hands.

652
00:52:49.383 --> 00:52:50.950
>>I don't fucking know you.

653
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:52.821
>>No. sir.

654
00:52:54.736 --> 00:52:56.390
>>So what do you want?

655
00:52:57.957 --> 00:52:59.785
>>Well. I heard y'all
thought it was a good idea

656
00:52:59.785 --> 00:53:03.745
to steal from the Nola
folk. said y'all thought

657
00:53:03.745 --> 00:53:06.226
we were all a bunch
of stupid cunts.

658
00:53:06.226 --> 00:53:09.098
wouldn't do shit
about it. that true?

659
00:53:10.317 --> 00:53:13.668
>>I don't know what
that means. none of it.

660
00:53:17.019 --> 00:53:19.108
But if something
was stolen from you

661
00:53:19.108 --> 00:53:22.808
and that something's
been returned.

662
00:53:22.808 --> 00:53:25.854
I don't see why we can't
forget the whole thing.

663
00:53:25.854 --> 00:53:28.161
just go on about our lives.

664
00:53:28.161 --> 00:53:30.903
over here. wherever
you come from.

665
00:53:35.299 --> 00:53:36.778
No. no. no. no. no. no!

666
00:53:36.778 --> 00:53:38.693
Hey. hey. please. look.

667
00:53:38.693 --> 00:53:40.826
hey. look. this can
be worked out. okay.

668
00:53:40.826 --> 00:53:42.828
All right. whatever
happened. all right.

669
00:53:42.828 --> 00:53:44.264
wrongs can be righted.

670
00:53:44.264 --> 00:53:45.439
>>Well. that's why I'm here.

671
00:53:45.439 --> 00:53:47.789
>>Okay. well.
let's do that then.

672
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:49.138
okay. let's just talk about it.

673
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:52.968
Hey. you got what you
came here for. huh?

674
00:53:52.968 --> 00:53:54.100
>>Almost.

675
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:58.278
>>No. no!

676
00:53:59.366 --> 00:54:01.499
No. fucking no. Trey. no!

677
00:54:02.369 --> 00:54:03.283
Fucking stop. fuck!

678
00:54:38.797 --> 00:54:42.279
>>2292 Kent Street.
Tupelo. Mississippi.

679
00:54:45.369 --> 00:54:47.806
Yeah. he gave that up too.

680
00:54:47.806 --> 00:54:50.374
>>They got nothing
to do with this.

681
00:54:50.374 --> 00:54:51.810
>>They do now.

682
00:54:53.464 --> 00:54:58.469
You try to leave
town. cops. whatever.

683
00:54:59.905 --> 00:55:03.996
my man in Tupelo gets
rambunctious. you understand me?

684
00:55:16.182 --> 00:55:17.314
I'll be in touch.

685
00:55:26.366 --> 00:55:29.151
Is that a tulip
tree or a dogwood?

686
00:55:30.196 --> 00:55:31.937
Huh?

687
00:57:50.162 --> 00:57:52.469
>>Morning. Shel.

688
00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:53.731
>>Hi. Uncle Bodie.

689
00:57:53.731 --> 00:57:55.950
What you doing out
around these parts?

690
00:57:57.082 --> 00:57:58.866
>>Hell you been. boy?

691
00:57:58.866 --> 00:58:03.915
>>Oh. I got a couple of hog
traps out at the end of 5-79.

692
00:58:05.133 --> 00:58:06.787
weir been rising
a little. I guess.

693
00:58:06.787 --> 00:58:08.354
they've all been underwater now.

694
00:58:08.354 --> 00:58:10.835
just had to move
them a little higher.

695
00:58:10.835 --> 00:58:13.620
>>Well. better you than me.
I'd just as soon shoot them.

696
00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:16.493
Anyway. I'm here
looking for Trey.

697
00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:17.711
>>Hm. yeah?

698
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:19.060
>>Yeah. you seen
him. heard from him?

699
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.194
>>No. no. not in a
couple of days. I guess.

700
00:58:22.194 --> 00:58:24.283
You know. Caroline's
back with her folks.

701
00:58:24.283 --> 00:58:26.415
so he. ah. he
hasn't been around.

702
00:58:26.415 --> 00:58:28.896
>>Okay.
>>Why. what's going on?

703
00:58:28.896 --> 00:58:32.552
>>Oh. probably nothing. I
got a call early this morning

704
00:58:32.552 --> 00:58:33.814
from the High Bar.

705
00:58:33.814 --> 00:58:36.382
they were complaining
about noise and whatnot

706
00:58:36.382 --> 00:58:38.950
and I gotta check it out.

707
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:40.473
'cause if a bar is complaining

708
00:58:40.473 --> 00:58:44.303
about noise from an apartment
upstairs.

709
00:58:44.303 --> 00:58:49.351
But as I said. it's probably
nothing. you know Trey.

710
00:58:49.874 --> 00:58:50.918
>>Yeah. I do.

711
00:58:50.918 --> 00:58:51.963
>>Yeah.

712
00:58:54.922 --> 00:58:56.620
So what happened here?

713
00:59:01.015 --> 00:59:02.843
>>Just locked myself out.

714
00:59:03.975 --> 00:59:05.019
>>Hm.

715
00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:09.023
and when you broke the
glass. it went this way?

716
00:59:13.767 --> 00:59:15.639
>>Caroline took
Mila to her folks

717
00:59:15.639 --> 00:59:16.857
up in Tupelo for a few days.

718
00:59:16.857 --> 00:59:20.339
we. ah. we got into
it the other night.

719
00:59:21.819 --> 00:59:23.821
threw a damn beer through
the window.

720
00:59:23.821 --> 00:59:25.779
That's why she left. you know.

721
00:59:27.128 --> 00:59:30.001
it's all just getting to us.
you know. just everything.

722
00:59:31.002 --> 00:59:33.787
>>Yeah. I do know. I was
married for 38 years.

723
00:59:33.787 --> 00:59:37.922
but I'd get this cleaned
up before Mila comes back.

724
00:59:37.922 --> 00:59:42.970
those little feet. oh. you
know. that's my princess.

725
00:59:43.841 --> 00:59:44.972
>>Yes. sir. will do.

726
00:59:44.972 --> 00:59:47.366
>>All right. let me
know if Trey turns up

727
00:59:48.236 --> 00:59:50.108
and good luck tonight.

728
00:59:50.108 --> 00:59:51.631
>>Thank you.

729
00:59:51.631 --> 00:59:55.809
>>Oh. does Trey still
drive that. that Jap thing?

730
00:59:56.897 --> 00:59:58.682
>>Yes. sir. he does.

731
00:59:58.682 --> 01:00:01.162
can't get him to go
American quite just yet.

732
01:00:02.163 --> 01:00:03.817
>>All right. take care.

733
01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:06.385
>>Yeah. you too.
>>All right.

734
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:29.930
>>Pack of Camels.

735
01:00:30.801 --> 01:00:33.064
>>Ah. there you go.

736
01:00:33.064 --> 01:00:35.196
That's eight even.

737
01:00:38.025 --> 01:00:38.852
Thank you.

738
01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:41.333
There you go.

739
01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:45.250
>>Say. what do y'all
do in this town?

740
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.991
>>Pardon me?

741
01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:50.864
>>Oh. no disrespect. old timer.

742
01:00:50.864 --> 01:00:53.693
but what do people do here?

743
01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:54.999
>>Like for fun?

744
01:00:54.999 --> 01:00:57.001
>>People have fun here?

745
01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:58.916
>>[laughing] Well. sure. I mean.

746
01:00:58.916 --> 01:01:01.527
we got the track
on Monday nights

747
01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:06.227
and hunting and football
in the fall. I guess.

748
01:01:06.227 --> 01:01:10.884
>>So between shooting squirrels
and high school football.

749
01:01:10.884 --> 01:01:13.887
people just kind of meander
around waiting to die?

750
01:01:15.367 --> 01:01:17.761
>>I. I guess.

751
01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:19.458
No. that. that ain't right.

752
01:01:19.458 --> 01:01:22.069
>>You grow up around here?

753
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:23.767
>>About a mile that a way.

754
01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:25.464
>>When you were growing up.

755
01:01:25.464 --> 01:01:28.162
you always wanted to run
the local gas station?

756
01:01:28.162 --> 01:01:29.816
>>Oh. you know.

757
01:01:31.035 --> 01:01:35.909
my daddy ran the station
down there on old 24.

758
01:01:35.909 --> 01:01:38.346
I guess I just followed suit.

759
01:01:38.346 --> 01:01:40.218
>>Here you are. huh?

760
01:01:40.218 --> 01:01:42.176
>>Yes. sir. here I am.

761
01:01:42.176 --> 01:01:43.656
>>You got kids?

762
01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:46.964
>>Got a son. he grown though.

763
01:01:46.964 --> 01:01:48.530
>>I see. what's he do?

764
01:01:49.793 --> 01:01:53.666
>>[laughing] You ask
a lot of questions.

765
01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:55.450
>>I'm intrigued.

766
01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:57.757
Y'all intrigue me.

767
01:01:57.757 --> 01:01:58.932

no reason for it all.

01:10:23.828 --> 01:10:25.830
Tick tock goes the doc.

882
01:10:28.572 --> 01:10:29.312
Follow him.

883
01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:37.711
All right. when he
hits the highway.

884
01:10:37.711 --> 01:10:38.886
you're gonna pull
alongside him easy.

885
01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:40.627
like you're gonna pass him.

886
01:10:42.368 --> 01:10:43.717
>>No. I can't do that.

887
01:10:45.023 --> 01:10:46.285
>>Driving is easy.

888
01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:49.114
not getting the chance
to say goodbye is hard.

889
01:11:10.135 --> 01:11:12.833
>>Wait. no. no!

890
01:11:41.949 --> 01:11:44.865
>>Hey. Sheriff. you read me?

891
01:11:46.345 --> 01:11:47.520
>>Go ahead.

892
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.740
>>Afraid they're gonna
need you down here

893
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.873
at Bakersfield Road.
two clicks north of 24.

894
01:11:52.873 --> 01:11:54.527
>>What is it?

895
01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:58.401
>>Single vehicle. right.
victim with gunshot wound.

896
01:11:58.401 --> 01:12:00.925
>>Oh. all right. on my way.

897
01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.877
>>Keep it under 50.

898
01:12:39.877 --> 01:12:42.009
We should get another car.

899
01:12:42.009 --> 01:12:44.664
>>No. I'm done. I
did what you said.

900
01:12:44.664 --> 01:12:47.188
>>We ain't done yet. under 50.

901
01:12:49.147 --> 01:12:51.715
>>Look. if you just
let them go. all right.

902
01:12:51.715 --> 01:12:53.847
I'll do whatever
the fuck you want.

903
01:12:53.847 --> 01:12:55.327
>>Oh. I know.

904
01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:26.358
>>Whoa. whoa. Ms. Whitney.

905
01:13:26.358 --> 01:13:29.883
>>Goddammit. Sheriff. the
hell's wrong with you?

906
01:13:29.883 --> 01:13:32.756
>>I do apologize.
but it is urgent.

907
01:13:32.756 --> 01:13:36.847
Now I have reason to believe
that your life is in danger.

908
01:13:36.847 --> 01:13:39.893
so what I want you to do is
just pack a couple of things

909
01:13:39.893 --> 01:13:41.025
and come with me.

910
01:13:42.069 --> 01:13:44.071
>>The hell you do
and the hell I am.

911
01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:45.682
>>Ms. Whitney.
>>I don't care

912
01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:47.858
about what happened
down at that clinic.

913
01:13:47.858 --> 01:13:49.773
I'm staying the hell out of it.

914
01:13:49.773 --> 01:13:53.124
>>Okay. you win. now would
it be all right with you

915
01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:56.432
and with your permission.
if I just had my deputy

916
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.824
stay outside parked there?

917
01:13:57.824 --> 01:13:59.826
>>As long as he's
off my property.

918
01:13:59.826 --> 01:14:01.785
I don't give a rat's
ass what he does.

919
01:14:01.785 --> 01:14:03.830
>>I understand. I
do. thank you. thank-

920
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:07.399
Lord have mercy.

921
01:15:02.454 --> 01:15:05.370
>>Well. isn't this a pickle?

922
01:15:08.329 --> 01:15:09.287
>>A pickle?

923
01:15:11.158 --> 01:15:13.204
>>What the hell
you want me to do?

924
01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.686
>>I'm getting the feeling
you're angry at me.

925
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:20.864
angry as if you didn't
take it upon yourself

926
01:15:20.864 --> 01:15:24.345
to rob some very wealthy and
powerful people at gunpoint

927
01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:28.349
and didn't get away with it.
as if what's happening now

928
01:15:28.349 --> 01:15:31.831
wasn't a direct result
of your own actions.

929
01:15:31.831 --> 01:15:33.746
that's the feeling I'm getting.

930
01:15:36.053 --> 01:15:38.534
>>I didn't ask for this shit.

931
01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:39.883
>>Yeah. you did.

932
01:16:06.257 --> 01:16:07.867
>>Sheriff's Department.

933
01:16:07.867 --> 01:16:09.521
>>Yeah. hi. um.

934
01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:11.828
you're gonna have to head
over to the station off 46.

935
01:16:11.828 --> 01:16:15.005
because there's a body
in the trunk of a car

936
01:16:15.005 --> 01:16:16.615
and make it quick.

937
01:16:47.037 --> 01:16:50.170
>>Uh!

938
01:16:53.957 --> 01:16:54.697
>>Come on.

939
01:16:57.395 --> 01:16:58.570
>>No.

940
01:16:58.570 --> 01:16:59.397
>>Yes.

941
01:17:06.578 --> 01:17:07.971
>>Shit.

942
01:17:09.015 --> 01:17:10.669
Oh. God. is she dead?

943
01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.367
>>Not yet.

944
01:17:13.367 --> 01:17:16.544
>>What the fuck.
man. what the fuck?

945
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.940
>>Go on.

946
01:17:23.508 --> 01:17:24.683
>>No.

947
01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:27.164
No. fuck you. get the
fuck away from me.

948
01:17:29.993 --> 01:17:33.866
>>Shelby. I don't kill innocent
people. I told you that.

949
01:17:33.866 --> 01:17:36.782
>>Well. I'm sure as
shit not gonna do it.

950
01:17:36.782 --> 01:17:39.611
>>Well. I'm gonna show
you something right now.

951
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:43.223
I have to give you a
warning before I do.

952
01:17:44.747 --> 01:17:47.010
it's gonna be very unpleasant.

953
01:17:57.629 --> 01:18:01.198
Uh!

954
01:18:01.198 --> 01:18:02.895
>>I'll kill you.

955
01:18:02.895 --> 01:18:06.159
I swear to God I'll
kill you. I'll do it.

956
01:18:06.159 --> 01:18:07.334
>>Okay.

957
01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:17.693
Get it done.

958
01:19:41.559 --> 01:19:42.560
We gotta go.

959
01:19:44.954 --> 01:19:46.651
Hey.

960
01:19:46.651 --> 01:19:47.913
We gotta get now.

961
01:20:03.059 --> 01:20:04.800
Go. go.

962
01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.626
Go.

963
01:20:27.735 --> 01:20:30.260
>>Come on. come on!

964
01:20:30.260 --> 01:20:31.087
Oh. shit!

965
01:20:51.542 --> 01:20:53.500
Where the hell you been?

966
01:20:56.547 --> 01:20:58.549
>>That ain't fair. Bodie.

967
01:20:59.724 --> 01:21:01.030
We all got that call.

968
01:21:02.422 --> 01:21:04.120
>>You made the wrong one.

969
01:21:05.338 --> 01:21:06.426
She is dead.

970
01:22:02.961 --> 01:22:04.963
>>I wanna kill you.

971
01:22:04.963 --> 01:22:06.704
>>I know.

972
01:22:09.881 --> 01:22:11.274
Your family's on the way.

973
01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:15.104
>>What. here?

974
01:22:15.104 --> 01:22:17.715
>>Not here. but
close. they're safe.

975
01:22:26.028 --> 01:22:26.854
>>Oh. shit.

976
01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:41.173
>>Stay cool. Shel.

977
01:22:52.663 --> 01:22:53.881
>>Hey. Sheriff.

978
01:22:55.883 --> 01:22:56.667
>>Shelby.

979
01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:11.247
I don't believe I know you.

980
01:23:11.247 --> 01:23:16.295
>>This here's my new sponsor
over from New Orleans.

981
01:23:17.427 --> 01:23:19.298
>>Fred Ellsworth.
Ellsworth Construction.

982
01:23:20.604 --> 01:23:21.997
>>Nola. huh?

983
01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.520
>>Most of the time.

984
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.218
I'm opening up a small
shop down these parts

985
01:23:26.218 --> 01:23:29.395
and recognize the power
of local marketing

986
01:23:29.395 --> 01:23:31.919
through this here young talent.

987
01:23:31.919 --> 01:23:33.051
>>Tax trip. huh?

988
01:23:33.051 --> 01:23:34.966
>>Hm.
>>Hm

989
01:23:34.966 --> 01:23:36.968
What you got there going on?

990
01:23:37.925 --> 01:23:39.753
>>Oh.

991
01:23:39.753 --> 01:23:42.408
yeah. I nicked it on. ah.

992
01:23:42.408 --> 01:23:46.064
I nicked it on. on the door
getting out of this old car.

993
01:23:46.064 --> 01:23:48.066
just clumsy is all.

994
01:23:50.982 --> 01:23:54.594
>>All right. so what is this.
a early morning meeting?

995
01:23:54.594 --> 01:23:56.466
>>[laughing] Hog hunting.

996
01:23:57.597 --> 01:23:59.121
>>Really now?

997
01:23:59.121 --> 01:24:02.385
>>That's right. "Showing this
city slicker how it's done."

998
01:24:02.385 --> 01:24:03.429
he said. so.

999
01:24:04.865 --> 01:24:06.389
>>In those?

1000
01:24:06.389 --> 01:24:07.955
>>Oh. God. I hope not.

1001
01:24:07.955 --> 01:24:12.047
I mean. these are. these are
way too expensive to get dirty.

1002
01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:15.615
>>No. I won't do that to you.
I got some mucks for him.

1003
01:24:15.615 --> 01:24:16.921
>>Oh. good.

1004
01:24:16.921 --> 01:24:18.923
You're welcome to join
if you'd like. Sheriff.

1005
01:24:18.923 --> 01:24:23.971
>>Oh. no. Shelby here uses a
bow. that's a young man's game.

1006
01:24:24.842 --> 01:24:26.931
too much running around for me.

1007
01:24:26.931 --> 01:24:30.282
I like. I like to keep
a distance. you know?

1008
01:24:30.282 --> 01:24:32.545
So they don't see me coming.

1009
01:24:32.545 --> 01:24:34.982
>>Well. now I know
what I'm in for.

1010
01:24:34.982 --> 01:24:36.593
>>Yeah. you do.

1011
01:24:38.812 --> 01:24:43.861
So Caroline. Mila. they're
still back in Tupelo way

1012
01:24:44.514 --> 01:24:45.993
or what's going on?

1013
01:24:45.993 --> 01:24:48.170
>>Yes. sir. yeah. through
the week. I reckon.

1014
01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:49.301
>>Ah-huh.

1015
01:24:49.301 --> 01:24:50.868
>>You know. Mila just. ah.

1016
01:24:50.868 --> 01:24:53.523
just loves that little
house there on Kent Street.

1017
01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.700
>>Shelby. talk to you.

1018
01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.354
>>Yeah. you guys get it.

1019
01:25:08.538 --> 01:25:09.756
You seen Trey?

1020
01:25:11.018 --> 01:25:13.499
>>Oh. no. not since last
week when he was here.

1021
01:25:13.499 --> 01:25:14.848
>>Mm-hm.

1022
01:25:16.241 --> 01:25:17.547
We found his car.

1023
01:25:18.678 --> 01:25:19.940
>>No shit?

1024
01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:23.466
>>No shit. Firestone
Factory all banged up.

1025
01:25:24.336 --> 01:25:25.772
>>Hell.
>>Mm-hm.

1026
01:25:25.772 --> 01:25:27.818
>>Not considered missing. is he?

1027
01:25:30.081 --> 01:25:31.169
>>You okay?

1028
01:25:32.823 --> 01:25:35.826
>>Yeah. just getting
ready to get out there.

1029
01:25:39.221 --> 01:25:41.832
>>You wanna tell me something?

1030
01:25:42.963 --> 01:25:44.008
Anything?

1031
01:25:46.924 --> 01:25:48.360
Go ahead. go ahead.

1032
01:25:49.622 --> 01:25:52.625
>>That robbery at the
clinic a few days ago.

1033
01:25:52.625 --> 01:25:54.366
>>Mm-hm.

1034
01:25:54.366 --> 01:25:56.977
>>I. ah. I think that was Trey.

1035
01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:59.415
>>You do now?

1036
01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:04.071
>>Yeah and then the
murder of the. ah.

1037
01:26:04.071 --> 01:26:06.030
the doctor I heard
about last night.

1038
01:26:07.684 --> 01:26:10.426
yeah. I think
maybe Trey's trying

1039
01:26:10.426 --> 01:26:12.993
to. I don't know. clean up.

1040
01:26:12.993 --> 01:26:13.994
>>Hm. well.

1041
01:26:15.866 --> 01:26:17.781
>>I'm real worried
about him. Uncle Bodie.

1042
01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:20.392
>>Yeah. it was more than 100 K.

1043
01:26:20.392 --> 01:26:23.917
that could change a man's
life. could ruin it.

1044
01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:27.182
You telling the truth?

1045
01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.491
All right.

1046
01:26:32.491 --> 01:26:35.277
now you. you tell me
if you run into Trey.

1047
01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:37.453
>>Will do.

1048
01:26:38.323 --> 01:26:40.543
>>Now what's your name again?

1049
01:26:40.543 --> 01:26:41.979
>>Fred.

1050
01:26:41.979 --> 01:26:43.459
>>Fred. it's a pleasure.

1051
01:26:43.459 --> 01:26:45.069
>>Nice meeting you. Sheriff.

1052
01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.770
>>Now you be careful
of them hogs there.

1053
01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:54.644
They're ugly bastards and
they'll get your goose

1054
01:26:54.644 --> 01:26:57.212
and they'll put a tusk
right straight through you.

1055
01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:58.822
like it was nothing.

1056
01:26:58.822 --> 01:27:00.954
leave you out there
on the field bleeding.

1057
01:27:03.392 --> 01:27:04.958
>>Jesus.

1058
01:27:04.958 --> 01:27:06.743
Thanks for the warning.

1059
01:27:08.832 --> 01:27:12.227
>>All right. well.
get after it. yep.

1060
01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:13.837
>>See you. Sheriff.

1061
01:27:46.826 --> 01:27:49.612
>>Get on the horn to Tupelo PD.

1062
01:27:49.612 --> 01:27:53.485
get me an APB on Caroline
and Mila Conners.

1063
01:27:53.485 --> 01:27:55.748
Get Caroline's maiden name

1064
01:27:56.967 --> 01:27:58.882
and Kent Street.
that's all I got.

1065
01:28:00.187 --> 01:28:02.886
Ben. do it now.

1066
01:28:02.886 --> 01:28:04.975
>>10-4. Bodie.
>>I'll see you at the office.

1067
01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.893
>>What did you have
to say over there?

1068
01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.549
>>Just looking for
the guy you killed

1069
01:28:13.549 --> 01:28:15.594
with the trash bag is all.

1070
01:28:15.594 --> 01:28:16.508
>>And where is he?

1071
01:28:18.641 --> 01:28:19.424
>>Gone.

1072
01:28:22.949 --> 01:28:26.866
>>It's almost that
time. take me to my car.

1073
01:29:49.471 --> 01:29:52.561
>>You gonna stab me
or slit my throat?

1074
01:29:54.954 --> 01:29:55.912
>>Maybe both.

1075
01:30:03.833 --> 01:30:05.487
>>Who's the battle ax?

1076
01:30:08.141 --> 01:30:11.623
>>The one who taught me it's
not how hard you swing it.

1077
01:30:11.623 --> 01:30:13.146
but how sharp it is.

1078
01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.202
>>So let me get this straight.

1079
01:30:27.509 --> 01:30:30.425
small town race car
driver with Parkinson's

1080
01:30:31.513 --> 01:30:32.862
struggles to make ends meet

1081
01:30:34.037 --> 01:30:35.865
for his wife and
his little daughter.

1082
01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:39.216
Goddamn!

1083
01:30:42.045 --> 01:30:45.309
>>We all play the hand
we're dealt. I guess.

1084
01:30:45.309 --> 01:30:46.919
>>And you're still going.

1085
01:30:49.182 --> 01:30:51.271
still fighting the
good fight left in you.

1086
01:30:52.838 --> 01:30:54.536
>>That's what we do.

1087
01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:56.929
>>Who's we?

1088
01:31:01.368 --> 01:31:06.156
>>Us. all of us. I
don't fucking know.

1089
01:31:06.156 --> 01:31:07.679
>>Not all of us.

1090
01:31:14.251 --> 01:31:16.645
>>What the fuck do you care?

1091
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:18.951
Huh?

1092
01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:23.478
Fuck. man. after last night.

1093
01:31:24.696 --> 01:31:25.915
after this whole damn week.

1094
01:31:25.915 --> 01:31:27.873
you wanna just keep
shitting on me?

1095
01:31:30.049 --> 01:31:31.964
You killed my wife's brother.

1096
01:31:31.964 --> 01:31:33.836
you made me kill that woman.

1097
01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.013
I took money from the
wrong fucking people.

1098
01:31:38.318 --> 01:31:40.930
I get it. Jesus Christ.

1099
01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:43.323
Look. I'm doing
everything you say.

1100
01:31:44.586 --> 01:31:46.413
I'm just trying to get
my fucking life back.

1101
01:31:47.589 --> 01:31:48.894
whatever life I got left.

1102
01:31:52.768 --> 01:31:55.510
>>We're all going in
the same direction.

1103
01:31:57.903 --> 01:31:58.948
>>Even you?

1104
01:32:00.123 --> 01:32:01.690
>>Oh. I know I am.

1105
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:05.998
That's the difference between me

1106
01:32:05.998 --> 01:32:07.913
and people in places like this.

1107
01:32:09.349 --> 01:32:10.394
oblivious.

1108
01:32:11.917 --> 01:32:16.052
>>Yeah. you keep talking about
how it's all meaningless.

1109
01:32:17.967 --> 01:32:20.796
You just do that to justify
the horrible shit you do.

1110
01:32:22.885 --> 01:32:26.541
There's a world where
all this has meaning.

1111
01:32:28.717 --> 01:32:29.544
it's this one.

1112
01:32:41.686 --> 01:32:43.601
>>You don't have to be alone.

1113
01:32:43.601 --> 01:32:46.604
Here at Healy
Family Funeral Home.

1114
01:32:46.604 --> 01:32:50.129
we will be by your side as
you navigate this special time

1115

we offer a variety of packages.

1117
01:32:56.396 --> 01:32:58.747
>>Christ. you can
count on that. huh?

1118
01:33:00.444 --> 01:33:04.013
When your business is
death in a town like this.

1119
01:33:05.057 --> 01:33:09.322
business is booming.
half off headstones.

1120
01:33:09.322 --> 01:33:12.238
When people are killing
themselves for pennies

1121
01:33:12.238 --> 01:33:14.850
and then taking
them for some rocks

1122
01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:16.373
to put over your rotting body.

1123
01:33:16.373 --> 01:33:17.809
>>Or call us. 4249.

1124
01:33:22.988 --> 01:33:24.468
>>When my folks died.

1125
01:33:24.468 --> 01:33:27.123
they didn't have two of those
pennies to rub together.

1126
01:33:27.123 --> 01:33:29.734
It took me years to
save up to replace

1127
01:33:29.734 --> 01:33:33.695
that shitty. wooden
gravestone the church donated.

1128
01:33:33.695 --> 01:33:38.525
>>And what was the point?

1129
01:33:38.525 --> 01:33:40.702
>>That we should
all be so lucky.

1130
01:33:40.702 --> 01:33:42.660
just to have a
proper place to rest.

1131
01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:44.880
when this is all said and done.

1132
01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:49.319
something that says.
"Hey. we were here."

1133
01:33:50.407 --> 01:33:51.190
>>Hm.

1134
01:33:56.718 --> 01:33:58.110
I was nine years old.

1135
01:33:59.198 --> 01:34:00.939
I came home from school

1136
01:34:00.939 --> 01:34:04.682
and I found my dad dead
on the kitchen floor.

1137
01:34:06.597 --> 01:34:08.947
Blew his head off
with a shotgun.

1138
01:34:09.948 --> 01:34:11.994
not before putting two
shells into my mom.

1139
01:34:11.994 --> 01:34:13.430
while she was in the bath.

1140
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:23.570
Shit. coroner took them. I
watched. no clue where to.

1141
01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.924
Some distant relative
probably thought it was best

1142
01:34:28.924 --> 01:34:31.883
for everyone that they burned
them and tossed the ashes.

1143
01:34:34.190 --> 01:34:36.018
I don't know.

1144
01:35:45.391 --> 01:35:47.002
>>Where are they?

1145
01:35:47.002 --> 01:35:49.004
>>They're safe.

1146
01:35:49.004 --> 01:35:52.703
I told you. you got
my word on that.

1147
01:35:52.703 --> 01:35:53.965
>>So this is him. huh?

1148
01:35:55.184 --> 01:35:59.057
>>Whoa. whoa. whoa.
whoa. what is this. huh?

1149
01:35:59.057 --> 01:36:00.885
>>He doesn't know?

1150
01:36:02.452 --> 01:36:03.714
>>Know what?

1151
01:36:06.891 --> 01:36:09.851
>>Well. go on.

1152
01:36:14.812 --> 01:36:19.774
>>No. no. I did everything
you asked. all of it.

1153
01:36:21.427 --> 01:36:22.951
>>You did.

1154
01:36:27.042 --> 01:36:29.914
>>You said you don't
kill the innocent.

1155
01:36:30.828 --> 01:36:31.786
you said that.

1156
01:36:34.745 --> 01:36:38.836
>>I saw you kill that woman.
Shel. I watched you do it.

1157
01:36:55.157 --> 01:36:59.030
>>Fuck!

1158
01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:06.342
>>We're all heading
the same way.

1159
01:37:08.039 --> 01:37:08.823
>>Yeah.

1160
01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:26.797
>>I believe that's it.

1161
01:37:26.797 --> 01:37:27.885
>>I believe so.

1162
01:37:27.885 --> 01:37:29.931
>>Back to New Orleans?

1163
01:37:31.933 --> 01:37:32.934
>>Maybe.

1164
01:37:32.934 --> 01:37:34.718
